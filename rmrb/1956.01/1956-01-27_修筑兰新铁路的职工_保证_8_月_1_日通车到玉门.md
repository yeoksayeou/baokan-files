Workers building the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway recently pledged to complete the line to Yumen by August 1st of this year, allowing large quantities of crude oil to be directly loaded onto trains from the Yumen oilfield for transportation. This would mean completing the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway's five-year plan one year and five months ahead of schedule. To date, construction workers have completed 82% of the track-laying tasks stipulated in the five-year plan. This year, construction workers have entered the new construction site west of Qingshui ahead of schedule, intensifying efforts to build the roadbed to Yumen. Key projects affecting the progress of track laying, the Hongshui River Bridge and the Beida River Bridge, have also commenced ahead of schedule. Construction workers plan to use advanced prefabricated construction methods to accelerate the progress of small and medium-sized bridges and culverts. A modern spike-laying factory is also being built on the new construction site. This year, the factory will utilize prefabricated components for continuous mechanized track-laying, increasing the speed of track-laying by more than double.

    修筑兰新铁路的职工
    保证8月1日通车到玉门
    修筑兰新铁路的职工最近提出保证，要在今年8月1日通车到玉门，让大量的原油提前从玉门油矿区直接装上火车外运。这样，修筑兰新铁路的五年计划，就可以提前一年零五个月完成。到目前为止，筑路职工已经完成了五年计划规定铺轨任务的82％。今年，筑路职工又提前进入了清水以西的新工地，加紧修筑通到玉门的路基；有关影响铺轨进度的关键工程——洪水河大桥和北大河大桥工程，也提前开工。筑路职工准备用先进的拼装式施工方法来加速中小桥涵的工程进度。新工地上还在筹建一座现代化的钉道工厂，今年将利用这座工厂预装的成品不停的机械化铺轨，使铺轨的速度提高一倍以上。　　　　（据新华社讯）
