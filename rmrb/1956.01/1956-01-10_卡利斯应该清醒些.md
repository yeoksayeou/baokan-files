　　Calis Should Be More Sober
　　Jiang Yuanchun
　　U.S. Air Force Secretary Calis, while hosting reporters in Taipei, referred to Taiwan and "any outlying islands of Taiwan" as "this base of ours in the Far East." He also threatened that China's liberation of Taiwan and its outlying islands would be "the most unwise move."

　　Presumably, Calis thinks it's very "wise" for the United States to seize other countries' territory as bases and carry out aggression against other countries.

　　Presumably, Calis thinks that using vague terms like "outlying islands" can be more intimidating.

　　May I ask who spent $6 billion to help Chiang Kai-shek start a civil war in China, only to be driven out of China in the end?

　　May I ask if the United States launched the Korean War of aggression and wasn't it finally driven back to the 38th parallel, and didn't it honestly sign an armistice agreement there?

　　At this reception, Calis repeatedly flaunted his military might, openly making threats against China, which had failed a thousand times, just as the Sino-American talks were about to resume.

　　Are these all wise?

　　All countries that respect their sovereignty and independence must recover their territories. This is where great wisdom lies. American generals do not understand this principle, but like donkeys, they always want to take the old road that is already impassable.

　　For their own sake, Calis should be more sober.

　　卡利斯应该清醒些
    蒋元椿
    美国空军部长卡利斯在台北招待记者，把台湾和“台湾的任何外围岛屿”说成是“我们在远东的此一基地”。他并且恫吓说中国要解放台湾和台湾的外围岛屿是“最不智之举”。
    想来卡利斯认为美国侵占别国的领土作基地，对别国进行侵略都是很“明智”的。
    想来卡利斯以为用什么“外围岛屿”这种糊涂字眼可以更加吓倒人一些。
    请问是谁花了60亿美元来帮蒋介石在中国发动内战，闹到最后自己被赶出中国？
    请问美国发动了朝鲜侵略战争，最后是不是被赶回三八线上，并且老老实实在那里签订了停战协定？
    卡利斯在这个招待会上翻来复去炫耀武力，公然在中美会谈快要复会的时候，对中国作这种失败了一千次的恫吓。
    难道这些都是明智的么？
    所有尊重自己的主权和独立的国家都要恢复自己的领土。这是大智所在。美国将军们不懂得这个道理，却像驴子一样，老想走那已经走不通的旧路。
    为他们自己，卡利斯应该清醒一些。
