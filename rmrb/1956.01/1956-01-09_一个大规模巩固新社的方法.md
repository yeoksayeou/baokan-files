　　A Method for Large-Scale Consolidation of New Cooperatives
　　Yuan Jingsen, Secretary of the CPC Cangxian County Committee, Hebei Province
　　The development of the cooperativization movement in 1955 was characterized not only by its speed and scale but also by its quality, reflecting the arrival of a high tide in the socialist mass movement in rural areas. However, as a Party organization, we should not be satisfied with these achievements but should continue to strive for the continuous consolidation and improvement of new cooperatives. The key to consolidating and improving new cooperatives lies in strengthening the Party's political and ideological education. The fact that Cangxian County Committee of Hebei Province further improved the quality of new cooperatives through a series of political and ideological education campaigns from October 28 to December 17, 1955, further proves this point.
　　By the end of October 1955, the proportion of peasant households in Cangxian County that had joined new cooperatives, plus those that had expanded old cooperatives, had increased from the original 30% to 77% of the total number of peasant households in the county. In order to enhance the confidence of these new cooperative members in running cooperatives and to ensure the continued improvement of the quality of these newly established cooperatives, the County Committee systematically launched political and ideological education campaigns for new cooperative members throughout the county. First, from October 28 to November 3, the County Committee led all township Party branches in conducting centralized training for 98.5% of the newly joined Party members. The training included lectures on Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the Resolution on Agricultural Cooperation of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, as well as the tasks of the Party's socialist revolution in rural areas. Subsequently, a major inspection of capitalist ideology was launched in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. The county commended 2,900 Party members who actively led the masses in running cooperatives, and sharply criticized and severely dealt with 91 Party members who had serious capitalist ideologies and had degenerated. In this training, the broad masses of Party members not only received vivid and profound class education but also learned the skills to run and consolidate cooperatives. Party members who were originally active in running cooperatives became even more active after being encouraged; Party members who were originally passive began to become active after being educated; and Party members who originally had only enthusiasm but lacked confidence increased their confidence after learning the methods. According to incomplete statistics from seven villages in five townships in the sixth, eighth, and eleventh districts, after the training, 95 Party members conducted individual work on 155 cooperative members who had ideological concerns and unstable emotions, quickly dispelling their concerns and stabilizing their emotions, thereby further consolidating these cooperatives. This significantly strengthened the Party's leadership over the cooperatives and the role of Party members in the cooperatives.
　　Secondly, from November 4 to November 11, 1955, the County Committee again led the rural Party branches throughout the county in conducting centralized training for 28,324 newly joined poor and lower-middle peasant members. The training repeatedly explained the Party's class line in rural areas and, in conjunction with the specific conditions of each township, explained the Party's mutually beneficial policies in running cooperatives, enabling all poor and lower-middle peasants to understand that they were the Party's reliance force, to feel their important responsibility, and to recognize the political significance of uniting with the well-to-do middle peasants in order to run the cooperatives well. They also learned specific methods for solving the problems of mutual benefit between the poor and middle peasants. This further encouraged the enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants in running cooperatives and further enhanced their confidence and ability to run the cooperatives well. According to statistics from four districts, 1,282 poor and lower-middle peasant members, after receiving training, were elected as cooperative cadres due to their improved ability to run cooperatives and their support from the members. In the 79 cooperatives in 11 townships in the sixth district, 332 poor and lower-middle peasant members actively conducted individual solidarity education on 665 well-to-do middle peasant members who had doubts, specifically dispelling their various concerns and gradually stabilizing their emotions. Many poor and lower-middle peasants in cooperatives, after receiving training, further inspected the assessment of the means of production and corrected the phenomena that harmed the interests of the well-to-do middle peasants.
　　Next, from November 14 to November 28, under the leadership of the County Committee, the county organized more than 11,000 junior middle school students, senior elementary school students, intellectuals in the townships, and grassroots rural cadres who had the ability to read and explain, to explain the "Draft Model Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" to the cooperative members through various occasions such as member congresses, member representative meetings, discussion meetings, and family meetings, and organized everyone to discuss it. Approximately 250,000 cooperative members participated in the lectures and discussions. This explanation and discussion was a universal and concrete education on the policy of cooperativization for the broad masses of new and old cooperative members. According to preliminary statistics, 1,118 of the 2,132 cooperatives in the county modified the imperfect and unreasonable parts of the original cooperative regulations in accordance with the provisions of the model regulations. On the issue of the ratio of land and labor dividends, 444 cooperatives changed from the original method of "land four and labor six, one share to the end" to the method of "land four and labor six within the fixed output, and land two and labor eight for the excess output"; and 559 cooperatives changed from the original method of "land four and labor six, one share to the end" to the method of "land four and labor six within the fixed output, and all excess output goes to labor." In addition, after learning, many cooperative members voluntarily turned over their private plots exceeding the provisions of the model regulations to the cooperative. According to statistics from nine villages and 25 cooperatives in the second, fourth, sixth, and ninth districts alone, 138 cooperative members turned over 405 mu of land that had been over-reserved to the cooperative for unified management.
　　Finally, from December 3 to December 17, the County Committee mobilized the members of the newly established cooperatives to participate in the inspection and evaluation movement of the production achievements and distribution results of the old cooperatives, not only comparing the changes in the lives of the members before and after joining the cooperatives but also comparing the living conditions of the members and individual farmers. This evaluation movement was a vivid education on the two roads comparison for the new cooperative members. It fully demonstrated the superiority of being organized and the backwardness of the small-scale peasant economy. Many poor farmers who were originally grain-deficient households became self-sufficient households after joining the cooperatives, and even became surplus grain households. On the contrary, many individual farmers outside the cooperatives, who were originally surplus grain households, became self-sufficient households or even grain-deficient households due to the lack of disaster resistance in individual management. After this comparative education, the emotions of the new cooperative members became more stable. After the evaluation meeting in Southeast Village, Fenghuadian Township, 15 new cooperative members who still had some concerns about running the cooperative unanimously stated: "Once we join the cooperative, we will stick to it to the end."
　　After such a series of large-scale political and ideological education campaigns, the quality of the new cooperatives has been significantly improved. Before October 28, among the 927 new cooperatives in the county (at that time, there were still 75 "cooperative skeletons"), 69.7% were first-class cooperatives, 24.4% were second-class cooperatives, and 5.9% were third-class cooperatives. After December 17, 82.7% became first-class cooperatives, 14.5% became second-class cooperatives, and only 2.8% remained as third-class cooperatives. Before October 28, 74% of the new cooperative members joined completely voluntarily, 19% were basically voluntary, and 7% were hesitant and wavering. After December 17, 87% of the new cooperative members joined completely voluntarily, 10% were basically voluntary, and only 3% remained hesitant and wavering.
　　Currently, Party organizations at all levels in Cangxian County are continuing to consolidate this batch of newly established cooperatives in conjunction with the development of another batch of new cooperatives, the formulation of production plans for old and new cooperatives, and winter production.

　　一个大规模巩固新社的方法
    中共河北省沧县县委书记　苑景森
    1955年合作化运动的发展，不仅速度快、数量大，而且质量也高，这是农村社会主义群众运动的高潮到来以后的特点。但是，作为一个党组织，就不应该满足于这种已有的成绩，而应该继续为新社的不断巩固和提高而努力。巩固和提高新社的关键在于加强党的政治思想教育工作。河北沧县县委从1955年10月28日到12月17日的一个时期之内，通过一系列的政治思想教育，进一步提高了新社质量的事实，更加证明了这一点。
    1955年10月下旬，沧县全县加入新社的农户加上老社扩大的农户占全县总农户的比例，已由原来的30％提高到77％。县委为了提高这批新社员的办社信心，保证继续提高这批新建社的质量，就有计划地在全县范围内展开了对新社员的政治思想教育工作。首先，从10月28日到11月3日，县委领导全县所有乡支部对98.5％的新入社的党员进行了集中的训练。在训练中讲解了毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党的七届六中全会（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议，讲解了党在农村的社会主义革命的任务，接着以批评和自我批评的精神展开了关于资本主义思想的大检查。全县对2，900个带领群众积极办社的党员进行了表扬，对91个有严重的资本主义思想并蜕化变质的党员作了尖锐的批判和严肃的处理。广大党员在这一次训练中，不但受到了生动而深刻的阶级教育，同时也学到了办社和巩固社的本领。原来积极办社的党员，由于受到了鼓励，更加积极；原来消极的党员，由于受到了教育，开始积极起来，原来只有热情，缺乏信心的党员，由于学到了办法，增加了信心。据第六、第八、第十一三个区五个乡七个村的不完全统计，经过训练之后，有95个党员，分别对155个思想有顾虑、情绪不稳定的社员进行个别工作，很快就解除了他们的顾虑，稳定了他们的情绪，使这些社更加巩固起来。这就使党对合作社的领导和党员在合作社中的作用有了显著的加强。
    其次，从1955年11月4日到11月11日，县委又领导全县农村支部对新入社的28，324名贫农和下中农社员进行了集中训练。训练中反复讲解了党在农村的阶级路线，同时结合各个乡的具体情况说明了党在办社中的互利政策，使全体贫农和下中农懂得了自己是党的依靠力量，感到了自己的重大责任，也认识了只有团结富裕中农才能把社办好的政治意义，并且学到了解决贫、中农之间互利问题的具体办法。这就更加鼓舞了贫农和下中农办社的积极性，也更加提高了贫农和下中农把社办好的信心和才能。据四个区的统计，有1，282个贫农和下中农社员，经过训练之后，由于提高了办社才干得到了社员的拥护，当选为社干部。第六区11个乡79个社中，有332个贫农和下中农社员，主动地对665个心存疑虑的富裕中农社员进行了个别的团结教育，具体地解除了他们的各种疑虑，使他们的情绪逐步稳定下来。还有不少合作社的贫农和下中农在经过训练之后，进一步检查了生产资料的评定工作，纠正了损害富裕中农利益的现象。
    接着，从11月14日到11月28日，在县委的领导下全县又组织了有阅读和讲解能力的初中学生、高小学生、在乡知识分子以及乡村基层干部11，000多人，通过社员大会、社员代表会、座谈会和家庭会议等各种场合，向社员群众讲解了“农业生产合作社示范章程草案”，并组织大家讨论。先后参加听讲和参加讨论的社员群众有25万人左右。这次讲解和讨论，对广大新老社员是一次普遍的具体的合作化政策的教育。据初步统计，全县2，132个社中有1，118个社按照示范章程的规定，修改了原订社章中不完善不合理的部分。在土地和劳力分红的比例问题上，有444个社由原来的地四劳六、一分到底的办法，改为定产之内地四劳六，超产部分地二劳八的办法；还有559个社由原来的地四劳六、一分到底的办法，改为定产之内地四劳六，超产部分全部归劳的办法。此外，有不少社员经过学习之后，自动地将超过示范章程规定的自留地交到社内。仅据第二、四、六、九区九个村25个社的统计，就有138个社员把多留的405亩土地交给合作社统一经营。
    最后，从12月3日到12月17日，县委发动新建社社员参加了老社的生产成绩和分配结果的检查评比运动，不仅把社员入社前后的生活变化作了对比，也把社员和个体农民的生活情况作了对比。这次评比运动对新社员是一次两条道路对比的生动教育。充分显示了组织起来的优越性和小农经济的落后性。不少原来是缺粮户的贫困农民，参加合作社以后变成了自足户，甚至变成了余粮户。相反，在社外的个体农民有不少原来是余粮户，由于个体经营缺乏抗灾的能力，反而由余粮户变成自足户，甚至变成缺粮户。经过这次对比教育，新社社员更稳定了情绪。风化店乡东南村经过评比会后，有15户对办社还有一些顾虑的新社员一致表示：“只要入了社，就要干到底。”
    经过这样一系列的大规模的政治思想教育以后，新社的质量已有显著提高。在10月28日以前，全县927个新社中（当时还有75个是社架子）一类社是69.7％，二类社是24.4％，三类社是5.9％。12月17日以后，一类社成了82.7％，二类社成了14.5％，三类社只剩2.8％了。在10月28日以前，新社员中完全自愿入社的占74％，基本自愿的占19％，犹豫动摇的占7％。而在12月17日以后，新社员中完全自愿的已占87％，基本自愿的占10％，犹豫动摇的只剩3％了。
    现在，沧县各级党组织正在结合另一批新社的发展，结合老社和新社制定生产计划以及结合冬季生产，继续对这批新建社进行巩固工作。
