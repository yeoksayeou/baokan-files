    China National Pharmaceutical Company Plans Rural Medicine Supply Work
    Under the leadership of the Ministry of Commerce, the China National Pharmaceutical Company recently held a national managers' meeting to plan rural medicine supply work.
    Based on the rapid development of agricultural cooperativization and the general demand of agricultural production cooperatives for health kits, midwifery kits, and livestock health kits, the meeting decided to supply 3.5 million various health kits in 1956. This includes 2.5 million agricultural production cooperative health kits, 280,000 midwifery kits, and 350,000 livestock health kits. In addition, 370,000 health kits will be supplied to schools, handicraft production cooperatives, exploration teams, factory workshops, mines, train/ship travel, and families.
    The meeting also made plans for medicines to eliminate the four pests (rats, sparrows, flies, mosquitoes) and eradicate seven diseases (malaria, schistosomiasis, filariasis, hookworm disease, kala-azar, leprosy, syphilis) in accordance with the central government's health plan, and made appropriate arrangements for the source of goods.
    In addition, in order to adapt to the new situation in rural areas, the meeting also studied the establishment of rural commercial networks. (Li Wenyen)

    中国医药公司最近在商业部的领导下，召开了全国经理会议，规划了农村医药供应工作。
    会议根据农业合作化的迅速发展和农业生产合作社普遍要求配备保健箱、接生箱、家畜保健箱的情况，确定在1956年内供应各种保健箱350万个。其中农业生产合作社保健箱250万个，接生箱28万个，家畜用保健箱35万个，此外，还有37万个保健箱供应学校、手工业生产合作社、勘探队、工厂车间、矿井、车、船旅行和家庭的需用。
    会议还根据中央的卫生事业规划，对除四害（老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子）和消灭疟疾、吸血虫病、血丝虫病、钩虫病、黑热病、麻疯病、梅毒等七种疾病的用药作了规划，货源也作了适当安排。
    此外，为了适应农村的新情况，会议对农村商业网的设置也作了研究。　　（李文彦）
