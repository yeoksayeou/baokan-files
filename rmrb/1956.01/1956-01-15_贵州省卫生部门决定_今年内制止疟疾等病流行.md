Guizhou Province Health Department Decides
To Stop the Spread of Diseases Such as Malaria This Year

    The Guizhou Province Health Department has decided to halt the spread of malaria, dysentery, and filariasis within this year.
    At the Sixth Guizhou Provincial Health Administration Conference, which closed on the 8th, it was decided to establish malaria and dysentery prevention and control committees at all levels to lead and promote the work of preventing and controlling malaria and dysentery. Filariasis, because it only prevails in some counties, will be eliminated through specific measures taken by the relevant counties. At the same time, the conference decided to strengthen the investigation and research on the distribution and incidence patterns of malaria, dysentery, and filariasis; establish a prevention and control team of 1,800 people throughout the province to carry out prevention and control work in a timely manner; and universally organize the masses in key areas to take medicine to prevent malaria and dysentery. Special attention should be paid to mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out the patriotic health campaign to eliminate pests such as mosquitoes and flies; protect water sources, and ensure that everyone drinks boiled water.
