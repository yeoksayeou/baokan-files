The Geology Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry will complete the Five-Year Mineral Quantity Plan in four years. By the end of 1955, the Geology Bureau had already completed 70% of the Five-Year Mineral Quantity Plan. Among them, several major minerals such as iron ore and copper ore have completed 80% of the Five-Year Plan, and certain non-metallic mineral resources such as refractory materials and metallurgical solvents are close to completing the Five-Year Plan. Recently, the Geology Bureau, together with the managers, team leaders, and union chairmen of various geological exploration companies, inspected the implementation of the tasks of the first three years of the Five-Year Plan. They unanimously agreed that it is possible to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years according to the instructions of the Ministry of Heavy Industry. In order to accelerate the speed of geological exploration and submit the mineral resources necessary for heavy industrial construction in advance, the geological exploration companies of the Geology Bureau will mobilize all employees to carry out labor competitions and strive to achieve this glorious task.

    重工业部地质局确定
    提前一年完成五年矿量计划
    重工业部地质局将以四年时间完成五年矿量计划。到1955年底，地质局已经完成了五年矿量计划的70％，其中有几种主要矿种如铁矿和铜矿，已经完成五年计划的80％，某些非金属矿产资源如耐火材料和冶金溶剂已经接近完成五年计划。最近，地质局同各地质勘探公司的经理、队长和工会主席检查了五年计划的前三年任务的执行情况以后，一致认为根据重工业部的指示，以四年时间完成五年计划是可能的。为了加快地质勘探速度，提前提交重工业建设所必需的矿产资源，地质局各地质勘探公司将动员全体职工开展劳动竞赛，为实现这一光荣任务而努力。
