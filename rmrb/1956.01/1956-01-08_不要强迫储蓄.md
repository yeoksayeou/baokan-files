    Do Not Force Savings
    Some staff members of banks and credit cooperatives in Rugao County, Jiangsu Province, are using coercive deduction methods to force farmers to save and buy government bonds.
    In late November 1955, staff members of the Chenbao Credit Cooperative in Jiang'an District of the county forced farmer Zhou Shigui to deduct the money he planned to use to buy food rations from the proceeds of selling oil crops for savings and government bonds. Zhang Youdao's wife in Yanqiao Township cried on the spot after being forced to buy government bonds. Many farmers were afraid of forced deductions and dared not sell oil crops, which resulted in the failure to complete the local oil crop procurement task on schedule.
    As long as we patiently explain the reasons to the farmers, they are willing to participate in savings, purchase government bonds, and repay loans. Using improper means to force farmers to participate in these activities will not only fail to complete the task, but also offend the farmers.

    不要强迫储蓄
    江苏省如皋县有些银行和信用合作社的工作人员，竟用硬性扣款的办法来强迫农民储蓄和买公债。
    1955年11月下旬，这个县江安区陈堡信用社的工作人员就曾经强迫农民周士贵把出售油料作物以后准备买口粮的钱扣作储蓄和买公债；燕桥乡张有道的老婆被硬性扣买公债后，当场大哭起来。许多农民因为怕硬性扣款，就不敢出卖油料作物，以致当地油料的收购任务不能按期完成。
    只要耐心地向农民讲清道理，农民是愿意参加储蓄、购买公债、归还贷款这类事情的。采用不正当的手段强迫农民参加这类事情，结果不但不能完成任务，反落个得罪农民。
