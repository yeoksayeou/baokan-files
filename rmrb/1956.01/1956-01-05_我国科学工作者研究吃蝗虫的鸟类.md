Chinese Scientists Study Birds That Eat Locusts
    The Ornithology Research Group of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, through identification of bird stomachs, discovered that there are eighteen species of birds that prey on locusts. Among them, the pratincole, the skylark, and the white-winged black tern eat the most locusts.
    The scientists conducted an interesting experiment on pratincoles. Pratincole chicks fed exclusively on locusts doubled their weight in two weeks. In a five-day feeding experiment, one chick ate a total of 454 locusts. Thus, a nest of five or six pratincoles can eat 16,200 locusts in a month, weighing about 5.4 kilograms. If the locusts eaten by a nest of pratincoles throughout the entire breeding season (about four months) were lined up end to end, they would reach three kilometers in length.
    Scientists also discovered that domestic ducks play an important role in eliminating locusts in lakeside areas. In the autumn of 1954, farmers in the Weishan Lake area released more than 30,000 domestic ducks, which ate all the autumn locusts in more than 25,000 mu of fields. This method is more economical and thorough than spraying powder or manual catching, and at the same time, it fattens the ducks. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　我国科学工作者研究吃蝗虫的鸟类
    中国科学院动物研究室鸟类研究组从对鸟胃的鉴定，发现有十八种捕食蝗虫的鸟。其中以燕鴴、田鹨、白翅浮鸥吃的蝗虫最多。
    科学工作者对燕鴴作了有趣的试验。专喂蝗虫的燕鴴雏鸟，在两个星期内体重增加了一倍。在五天的饲养试验中，一个雏鸟共吃了454个蝗虫，这样一窝五、六个燕鴴一个月可吃蝗虫16，200个。约重5.4公斤。如果把一窝燕鴴在整个繁殖期中（约四个月）所吃的蝗虫头尾相结地排列起来，可达三公里长。
    科学工作者还发现家鸭在消灭滨湖地带的蝗虫也有重要的作用。1954年秋季，微山湖湖滨的农民曾放了三万多只家鸭，把25，000多亩田的秋蝗吃光了。这个办法比喷洒药粉或人工捕打方法更经济、彻底，同时养肥了鸭子。　（据新华社讯）
