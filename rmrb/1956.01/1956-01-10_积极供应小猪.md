    Actively Supply Piglets
    In the high tide of agricultural cooperation, the production enthusiasm of farmers has increased, and the enthusiasm for raising pigs for manure has also soared to unprecedented levels. Many areas have experienced a phenomenon of piglets being in short supply and prices being too high.
    At present, the Jiangsu Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative system is actively taking measures to solve the problem of piglet supply. Their methods are: First, to investigate and find out the local situation of piglet production and demand. Second, to stipulate that the feed supply for sows three months before and after production should be increased from the original 100 jin per month to 180 jin, and the piglets from 30 jin to 40 jin, in order to encourage farmers to breed and raise piglets. Third, to sign contracts with sow-raising households to control the source of piglets and stabilize the market price of piglets. The Caojing District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Songjiang County has pre-ordered all 4,000 piglets in the district by issuing "Sow Feed Preferential Cards."

    积极供应小猪
    在农业合作化高潮中，农民的生产积极性提高了，养猪积肥的热情也空前高涨。许多地区都出现小猪供不应求、价格太高的现象。
    目前江苏省供销社系统正在积极采取措施解决小猪的供应问题。它们的办法是：一、调查摸底，弄清当地小猪生产和需要的情况。二、规定母猪在生产前后三个月，饲料供应从原来每月一百斤增加到180斤，小猪由30斤增加到40斤，以鼓励农民繁殖和培育小猪。三、跟养母猪户签订合同，控制小猪货源，稳定小猪的市场价格。松江县漕泾区供销社通过发“母猪饲料优待卡片”，把全区现有四千头小猪全部定购下来了。
