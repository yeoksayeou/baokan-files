Reactions to Criticisms and Suggestions

    Following the publication of the letter "A Commotion Caused by Four Cents" in the "Reader's Letters" section on November 21, 1955, Wang Ruiyu, Deputy Director of the Public Security Department of the Jiaozhou Prefectural Office in Shandong Province, has already sent a letter of self-criticism.
    The Supervisory Office of the Hubei Provincial Company of the China Native Produce Company writes: The criticism of Zhang Shuchun, the former manager of the Huanggang Native Produce Branch Company, in the "Reader's Letters" section on December 4, 1955, is correct. Zhang Shuchun has already received the administrative punishment of removal from his post and a Party warning.
    The Second Construction Company of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry writes to accept the criticism in the "Reader's Letters" section on December 11, 1955. With the help of the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the relevant higher-level economic leadership organs, the company's practice of overestimating material prices has been corrected.
    The Shandong Provincial People's Committee writes: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters" section on September 11, 1955, regarding "an administrative institution eating into the enterprise unit's establishment" is correct. We have already resolved this problem in conjunction with the work of streamlining the institutions.
    The Material Supply Department of the Qiqihar Railway Administration writes: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters" section on December 4, 1955, regarding the waste of state materials by the Suihua Material Factory under our administration is correct. The relevant derelict personnel have already received the punishments they deserve.
