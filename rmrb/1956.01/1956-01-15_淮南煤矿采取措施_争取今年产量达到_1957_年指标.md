    Huainan Coal Mine Takes Measures
    Strive for Output to Reach 1957 Target This Year
    (Our newspaper's Hefei dispatch on the 14th) The Huainan Mining Bureau is taking measures to strive to increase the daily coal output to the level required by the state at the end of 1957 before the end of this year. The Huainan Mining Bureau is now tapping the production potential of existing mines, and the coal production plan for the first quarter has been increased by more than 7% compared with the original plan. At the same time, it is also prepared to speed up the construction of new mines. In addition to putting the Xiejiaji No. 2 and No. 3 mines, which were originally planned to be put into production this year, into production ahead of schedule, the Liyingzi No. 1 and No. 2 mines, which were originally planned to be put into production in 1957, will also be put into production this year ahead of schedule.

    淮南煤矿采取措施
    争取今年产量达到1957年指标
    本报合肥14日电  淮南矿务局正采取措施，争取在今年年底以前把煤炭日产量提高到国家要求的1957年底的水平。淮南矿务局现在正在挖掘现有矿井的生产潜力，第一季度的产煤计划就比原计划提高7％以上。同时，还准备加快新井建设，除了把原计划今年投入生产的谢家集2号3号井提早投入生产外，还要把原来计划在1957年投入生产的李郢孜1号2号矿井提前在今年投入生产。
