Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 28th – The Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states continued its meeting on January 28th. The meeting began at 10:00 AM Central European Time.

The participants continued to discuss the second item on the agenda – discussion of issues arising from the Warsaw Treaty and joint measures.

The first speaker at today’s meeting was the Soviet representative, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Molotov.

The observer from the People's Republic of China, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council of the People's Republic of China, Marshal Nie Rongzhen, also spoke.

Xinhua News Agency, January 28th – According to a TASS report: The meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states opened on the morning of January 27th in the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs building in Prague.

First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense of Czechoslovakia, Čepička, addressed the meeting on behalf of the Czechoslovak people and government. He extended a heartfelt welcome to the participants of the meeting and wished the meeting complete success.

The meeting unanimously agreed that the chairman of this year's Political Consultative Committee meeting would be the representative of the People's Republic of Albania, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, Shehu.

According to the chairman's suggestion, the meeting adopted the following agenda:

	I. Organizational issues;

	II. Discussion of issues arising from the Warsaw Treaty and joint measures.

The Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Committee, Soviet Army General Antonov, gave a report on the first item on the agenda. The meeting adopted a corresponding resolution based on this report.

Next, the participants spoke on the second item on the agenda.

Shehu's Speech

The Chairman of the Albanian Council of Ministers, Shehu, spoke first. He expressed the satisfaction of the Government of the People's Republic of Albania with the convening of this meeting of the Political Consultative Committee. He went on to say that the characteristic of this period since the signing of the Warsaw Treaty is that the Soviet Union has taken many significant steps in maintaining and consolidating the peace and friendship of all peoples and preventing new wars, and other peace-loving countries have also made active efforts. However, despite the major changes that have taken place in the world, the US government and other Western blocs are still stubbornly pursuing their own aggressive policies. The Western countries' governments, headed by the US government, are accelerating the militarization of West Germany, which is now a participant in the aggressive North Atlantic bloc and the West European Union. The newly cobbled-together Baghdad Pact, some recent provocative statements by US leaders, and efforts to establish new military bases against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies – all of this proves that the threat of war has not been eliminated. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen, not weaken, the vigilance of our people and keep our defense forces in a state of constant readiness.

Shehu said: The Albanian people welcome the establishment of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic. This People's Army not only guarantees peace and the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic, but is also an important factor in maintaining peace and security in Europe.

Shehu emphasized that the People's Republic of Albania is deeply concerned with maintaining peace, further easing international tensions and strengthening international cooperation. Our delegation believes that constantly strengthening the fraternal cooperation between our countries in all aspects, in the spirit of the Warsaw Treaty, is the fundamental condition for the successful realization of our common policy.

Damyanov's Speech

The Deputy Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, Raiko Damyanov, spoke next. He first reviewed the international situation since the Warsaw Conference, saying that today we can note with great satisfaction that the policy pursued by the Warsaw Treaty countries has achieved significant success in maintaining and consolidating peace. However, we all cannot close our eyes to the fact that the advocates of the Cold War are doing everything possible to undermine efforts aimed at strengthening peace and security. The accelerated re-militarization of West Germany clearly shows why the German Democratic Republic had to establish a People's Army for the first time in the history of the German people, and the purpose of establishing this army is to defend the fundamental interests of the German people.

Damyanov went on to say that since the signing of the Warsaw Treaty, the international position of our republic has become stronger. Our country has never had such a solid international position and so many sincere friends. The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria firmly believes that, in cooperation with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the People's Democratic countries, and all peace-loving peoples of all countries, it will certainly be able to achieve new victories in the struggle for peace and international security. At the same time, the Bulgarian government believes that, as international relations continue to remain tense, it is necessary to constantly and firmly implement the Warsaw decisions and take all necessary new measures.

Hegeds' Speech

The Chairman of the Hungarian Council of Ministers, Hegedüs, pointed out in his speech: The past year has not been a year of increased international tensions, intensified Cold War, and increased international conflicts. This situation is the result of the Warsaw Treaty member states, especially the Soviet Union, tirelessly taking one measure after another for the benefit of stopping aggressive forces and improving the international atmosphere. The Hungarian government believes that the difference between the current international situation and the past is that many countries want to implement independent foreign policies and refuse to join aggressive blocs. This desire plays an increasingly important role in the struggle to ease international tensions. Many Asian and African countries, which want to consolidate the freedom and independence they recently obtained, particularly strongly hope for neutrality. We believe that expanding our trade relations with these countries is an important task.

Hegeds emphasized that, despite the improvement in the international situation last year, we cannot fail to note that Western countries continue to pursue a policy of establishing aggressive blocs. The government of the Hungarian People's Republic fully agrees with the resolution of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic on the establishment of its own People's Army. Under the current circumstances, when West Germany participates in aggressive Western blocs and is preparing to equip its army with atomic weapons, it is completely justified and necessary for the German Democratic Republic to take this step. We believe that doing so is necessary and appropriate, namely: the Warsaw Treaty member states will continue to advocate for the benefit of establishing a European collective security system, and before this system is established, take some necessary measures so that the countries concerned and major powers can reach a preliminary agreement. This could provide the possibility for a slowdown in the expansion of armaments in Europe and reduce the danger of a new war.

Ulbricht's Speech

The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, Ulbricht, spoke next.

Ulbricht said that the German people and the European people are seriously concerned about the significant threat posed by the re-militarization of West Germany. The decisions adopted by the Ministerial Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization last December include plans to intensify the organization of West German divisions within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as shock divisions, organize atomic and rocket corps, prepare for air combat, and rapidly develop munitions production. By the end of 1957, West Germany will have 12 divisions ready. In addition, another 12 divisions will be organized. The old German General Staff has already been revived in West Germany. Its personnel are mainly Hitler's generals who should be held responsible for the crimes committed by German militarism during the Second World War.

Ulbricht said that the government of the German Democratic Republic warned before the ratification of the Paris Agreements that the accession of the Federal Republic of Germany to the West European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization system would make German reunification impossible and would force the government of the German Democratic Republic to establish national armed forces to defend peace and protect the achievements of the working people of the German Democratic Republic. The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, with a deep sense of responsibility for the future of peace and the German nation, unanimously passed a bill in January this year to establish the National People's Army and the Ministry of National Defense. The government of the German Democratic Republic requests the Warsaw Treaty member states to agree to the participation of representatives of the German Democratic Republic in the Supreme Command of the Joint Armed Forces.

Ulbricht emphasized that we, on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving forces in Germany, welcome the proposals discussed today by the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states. The German Democratic Republic supports such proposals: replacing the current military blocs with a collective security system; and demarcating an area in Europe in which the number and deployment of armed forces are determined by agreements between the countries concerned.

From the perspective of the German Democratic Republic, there are no obstacles to reaching an agreement on limiting the armed forces of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The suggestion on withdrawing or reducing foreign troops stationed in the two parts of Germany is also in line with the suggestion of the government of the German Democratic Republic. We also agree to the suggestion of implementing supervision on the compliance of these agreements. It is also necessary to reach an agreement stipulating that the German armed forces will not be equipped with atomic weapons. The suggestion on signing a non-aggression treaty among European countries and undertaking the obligation to resolve all disputes through peaceful means is also completely in line with the resolution of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic in January this year.

Ulbricht concluded by saying that the German Democratic Republic will continue to do its utmost to promote the establishment of a European collective security system and the unification of Germany through agreements. The German Democratic Republic will do its best to fulfill its obligations to the Warsaw Treaty.

Cyrankiewicz's Speech

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic, Cyrankiewicz, pointed out in his speech that, considering the fact of West German rearmament and the continuous threat of revanchism, it is one of the important tasks to further strengthen the forces among the German people who yearn for peace and are prepared to defend peace. The representative of this force is primarily the German Democratic Republic. The National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic is now joining the armed forces of the Warsaw Treaty. This is the first German army in history that is connected with rich revolutionary traditions, the German working class, and Germany's truly peace-loving and democratic forces.

Cyrankiewicz went on to say that in the period since the signing of the Warsaw Treaty, many important international issues have been resolved due to the active efforts of peace forces. The Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of the Four Powers is a particularly important event with prospects for guaranteeing peace. The influence of the Bandung Asian-African Conference, the powerful development of the People's Republic of China, India's glorious role in international politics, and the growing resistance of Asian and African countries to the policy of military blocs have become increasingly important factors contributing to the consolidation of peace. All of this has aroused deep reactions from the general public, enlightened people's awareness, and strengthened their will to fight for peace, which cannot but affect the balance of world forces.

Cyrankiewicz said that Poland has consistently and firmly strived to seek common ground with everyone, as long as they are willing to base their policies and relations with us on the principles of equality and friendship among all peoples, regardless of differences in socio-political systems. We steadfastly advocate collective security, disarmament, and the unification of Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country. We have always held the view that the establishment of an all-European security system is the best guarantee of peace and security. In order to strive to achieve this goal, we extend a hand of friendship to the people of Western Europe, especially the French people, because the fate of France is often linked to our fate.

Cyrankiewicz concluded by saying that in the current situation, we should also discuss other possible ways that can promote the closeness of the people of all countries, thereby creating an atmosphere for the peaceful resolution of disputes. There is no doubt that the normalization of relations between European countries, as well as the establishment of a region, including the two parts of Germany, with restricted and supervised armed forces, based on the agreement of the countries concerned, while further fighting for the demand for disarmament, is in line with this purpose, according to the suggestion of the Soviet government.

Stoica's Speech

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic, Gheorghe Stoica, analyzed the international situation after the signing of the Warsaw Treaty, talked about the efforts of peace-loving countries in easing international tensions and developing international cooperation. He also talked about Romania's achievements in developing relations with Asian, Middle Eastern, and Near Eastern countries, and expressed Romania's willingness to develop political, economic, and cultural ties with its neighboring countries and Western countries.

Stoica went on to say that the Romanian People's Republic believes that the establishment of a European collective security system is particularly important for guaranteeing its own security. The German Democratic Republic's friendly relations and fruitful cooperation with peace-loving countries, the development of its international economic and cultural ties, and its consistent peace policy prove that the German Democratic Republic, as an independent and sovereign country, has made significant contributions to the cause of peace and international cooperation.

Stoica went on to say: We firmly advocate the adoption of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in international relations. We believe that disputed international issues can be resolved peacefully through consultation; the conditions are in place for establishing solid and lasting international relations of peace. However, we must not fail to note that certain aggressive blocs are trying everything possible to continue to implement dangerous policies of inciting the "Cold War" and policies of "strength," and are using these strongholds to threaten socialist countries. All of this makes the people of our countries and all peace-loving people have to constantly be vigilant. Under such international conditions, the close cooperation between our countries within the scope of the Warsaw Treaty, and the consistent measures taken by our countries in political, economic, and military cooperation based on this treaty, are of extremely great significance for safeguarding the security of our people and constructive peaceful labor.

Stoica concluded by saying that the Romanian People's Republic, as a signatory to the Warsaw Treaty, will do its best to fulfill its tasks in defending our common cause – the great cause of safeguarding peace and international security.

After Stoica finished speaking, the first meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states came to an end.

The next meeting will be held at 10:00 AM on the 28th.

    华沙条约缔约国代表在政治协商委员会会议上发言
    新华社布拉格28日电　华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会1月28日继续举行会议。会议在中欧时间上午10时开始举行。
    会议参加者继续讨论第二项议程——讨论华沙条约所引起的问题和共同措施。
    今天会议上第一个发言的是苏联代表、苏联部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长莫洛托夫。
    中华人民共和国观察员、中华人民共和国国防委员会副主席、中华人民共和国元帅聂荣臻也发了言。
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社报道：华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议，1月27日上午在布拉格的捷克斯洛伐克外交部大厦开幕。
    捷克斯洛伐克第一副总理兼国防部长契皮茨卡代表捷克斯洛伐克人民和政府在会上致词。他对会议的参加者表示衷心的欢迎，并且预祝这次会议圆满成功。
    会议一致同意今年的政治协商委员会会议由阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国代表、阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡担任主席。
    根据主席的建议，会议通过议程如下：
    一、组织问题；
    二、讨论由于华沙条约而产生的问题和共同措施。
    政治协商委员会秘书长、苏联陆军大将安东诺夫就第一项议程作了报告。会议根据这个报告通过了相应的决议。
    接着，会议参加者就第二项议程发言。
    谢胡的发言
    阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡首先发言。他代表阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府对政治协商委员会召开这次会议表示满意。他接着说，华沙条约签订以来的这一段时期的特点是：苏联在维护和巩固各国人民的和平和友谊以及防止新战争方面采取了许多重大步骤，其他爱好和平的国家也作了积极的努力。然而，尽管世界上已经发生了重大的变化，美国政府和其他西方集团仍然一成不变地执行着自己的侵略政策。以美国政府为首的西方国家政府在加速西德的军国主义化，西德现在已经是侵略性的北大西洋集团和西欧联盟的参加者。新拼凑起来的巴格达集团，一些美国领导人最近的挑拨性的言论，以及为建立反对苏联和人民民主国家的新的军事基地所作的努力——这一切都证明战争威胁并没有消除。因此，有必要加强、而不是削弱我们这几国人民的警惕，使我们的防御力量保持着时刻准备的状态。
    谢胡说：阿尔巴尼亚人民欢迎德意志民主共和国国家人民军的建立。这支人民军不但能保障和平和德意志民主共和国的主权，而且也是维护欧洲的和平和安全的重要因素。
    谢胡强调指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国深深关怀维护和平，进一步缓和国际紧张局势和加强国际合作。我们代表团认为，本着华沙条约的精神来不断加强我们各国在一切方面的兄弟合作，是成功地实现我们共同政策的基本条件。
    达米扬诺夫的发言
    保加利亚部长会议副主席拉·达米扬诺夫接着发言。他首先回顾了华沙会议以来的国际局势，他说，今天，我们能够十分满意地注意到，华沙条约国家奉行的政策已经在维持和巩固和平方面获得了重大成就。但是，我们大家都不能闭上眼睛不看这个事实：冷战的鼓吹者正在尽力破坏以加强和平和安全为目的的努力。西德加速重新军国主义化一事清楚地说明，为什么德意志民主共和国要在德国人民的历史上第一次建立一支人民军，建立这支军队的目的是保卫德国人民的根本利益。
    达米扬诺夫接着说，自从华沙条约签订以来，我们的共和国的国际地位已经变得更加强固。我们的国家从来没有过这样稳固的国际地位和这么多的真诚的朋友。保加利亚人民共和国政府坚信，在同苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家以及所有爱好和平的各国人民合作的情况下，一定可以在争取和平和国际安全方面取得新的胜利。同时，保加利亚政府认为，由于国际关系继续保持紧张状态，要求经常和坚定地执行华沙决定并且采取一切必要的新的措施。
    赫格居斯的发言
    匈牙利部长会议主席赫格居斯在发言中指出：过去一年在历史上并不是国际紧张局势加剧、冷战加剧和国际冲突增多的一年，这种情况是华沙条约缔约国，首先是苏联，为了制止侵略势力和改善国际气氛的利益而不倦地采取了一个又一个的措施的结果。匈牙利政府认为，目前国际局势不同于过去的地方是，许多国家都想执行独立的外交政策，拒绝加入侵略集团，这种愿望在缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中起着越来越大的作用。许多想要巩固不久以前获得的自由和独立的亚非国家特别强烈地希望中立。我们认为，扩大我们同这些国家的贸易关系是一项重要任务。
    赫格居斯强调说，尽管国际局势在去年获得了改善，但是，我们不能不注意，西方国家还继续执行建立侵略集团的政策。匈牙利人民共和国政府完全同意德意志民主共和国人民议院关于建立自己的人民军的决议。在目前的情况下，当西德参加侵略性的西方集团并且准备用原子武器来装备自己的军队的时候，德意志民主共和国采取这种步骤是完全有理由和有必要的。我们认为这样做是必要的和适宜的，这就是：华沙条约缔约国在以后仍将为建立欧洲集体安全体系的利益而表示倡导精神，而在这个体系没有建立以前，则采取一些必要的措施，以便为了使有关各国和大国能够达成初步协议。这样就能够为欧洲扩充军备的减缓提供可能、并且可以减少新战争的危险。
    乌布利希的发言
    德意志民主共和国部长会议第一副主席乌布利希接着发言。
    乌布利希说，德国人民和欧洲人民严重地担心西德重新军国主义化所产生的重大威胁。北大西洋公约组织部长理事会去年12月通过的决定中包含有这样的计划：加紧组织北大西洋公约组织范围内的西德师作为突击师，组织原子和火箭兵团，准备空战和迅速发展军火生产。到1957年底西德准备好的军队将有12个师。此外还要组织12个师。旧日的德国总参谋部已经在西德复活起来。其中的人员主要是那些应该对德国军国主义在第二次世界大战期间所犯下的罪行负责的希特勒将领。
    乌布利希说，德意志民主共和国政府在巴黎协定批准以前就提出了警告：德意志联邦共和国加入西欧联盟和北大西洋公约组织体系，将会使德国重新统一成为不可能，并且将会迫使德意志民主共和国政府建立国家武装部队以保卫和平和保护德意志民主共和国劳动人民的成果。德意志民主共和国人民议院怀着对和平和德国民族的未来的深刻责任感，在今年1月一致通过了建立国家人民军和国防部的法案。德意志民主共和国政府请求华沙条约缔约国同意德意志民主共和国代表参加联合武装部队最高司令部。
    乌布利希强调说，我们代表德意志民主共和国政府和德国一切爱好和平的力量，欢迎华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会今天所讨论的建议。德意志民主共和国支持这样的建议：用集体安全体系来代替现在的军事集团；在欧洲划出一个区域，在这个区域内的武装部队的人数和配置都由有关国家之间的协定来决定。
    从德意志民主共和国方面来说，要就限制德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的武装部队取得协议是没有障碍的。关于撤除或者减少驻在德国两部分的外国军队的建议，也是同德意志民主共和国政府的建议相符合的。我们还同意对这些协议的遵守实行监督的建议。还必须达成一项协议，规定德国的武装部队不配备原子武器。签订欧洲国家互不侵犯协定并且承担用和平方法解决一切争执问题的义务的建议，也是和德意志民主共和国人民议院今年1月的决议完全相符的。
    乌布利希最后说，德意志民主共和国今后仍将竭尽全力，以通过协议的办法促进欧洲集体安全体系的建立和德国的统一。德意志民主共和国将尽力实现自己对华沙条约的义务。
    西伦凯维兹的发言
    波兰人民共和国部长会议主席西伦凯维兹在发言中指出，考虑到西德重新武装的这一事实和连续不断的复仇主义的威胁，进一步加强德国人民当中那些渴望和平和准备保卫和平的力量，是重要的任务之一。这种力量的代表首先是德意志民主共和国。德意志民主共和国国家人民军现在加入华沙条约的武装部队。这是历史上第一支同丰富的革命传统、德国工人阶级和德国真正爱好和平和民主的力量有联系的德国军队。
    西伦凯维兹接着说，在华沙条约签订以来的这一个时期中，由于和平力量的主动努力，已经解决了许多重要的国际问题。四国政府首脑日内瓦会议就是对创造保证和平的前景具有特别重要意义的一件事。万隆亚非会议的影响、中华人民共和国的强大发展、印度在国际政治中的光荣作用、亚非国家对军事集团政策日益增长的反抗，成为有助于巩固和平的越来越重要的因素。所有这一切引起了广大公众的深刻反应，启发人民的觉悟，加强他们争取和平斗争的意志，这不能不影响世界力量的对比。
    西伦凯维兹说，波兰一贯坚定地努力争取同一切人求同，只要他们愿意不问社会政治制度的差别而把各国人民平等和友好的原则作为自己的政策和同我们的关系的基础。我们坚定不移地主张集体安全，主张裁军，主张把德国统一成为一个爱好和平和民主的国家。我们始终不变地抱着这种看法：建立全欧安全体系是和平和安全的最好保证。为了力求达到这个目标，我们向西欧各国人民，首先是法国人民伸出友谊的手，因为法国的命运往往同我们的命运联结在一起。
    西伦凯维兹最后说，我们在当前的形势下也应该讨论目前能够促进各国人民亲近的其他可能的办法，从而为和平解决争执问题创造气氛。毫无疑问，欧洲各个国家的关系的正常化，以及在进一步为实现裁军要求而斗争的同时，根据苏联政府的建议，在有关各国的协议的基础上，建立一个包括德国两个部分的、武装部队受到限制和监督的地区，是符合于这一目的的。
    斯托伊卡的发言
    罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席基·斯托伊卡在发言中分析了华沙条约签订以后的国际局势，谈到了爱好和平的国家在缓和国际紧张局势和发展国际合作的事业中的努力。他还谈到了罗马尼亚发展同亚洲、中东和近东国家的关系的成就，并且表示了罗马尼亚同它的邻国和西方国家发展政治、经济和文化各方面联系的愿望。
    斯托伊卡接着说，罗马尼亚人民共和国认为建立欧洲集体安全体系对保障自己的安全是特别重要的。德意志民主共和国同爱好和平的国家的友好联系和卓著成效的合作、它的国际经济和文化联系的发展和它的一贯的和平政策证明了，作为一个独立和有主权国家的德意志民主共和国，对和平和国际合作的事业作出了重大的贡献。
    斯托伊卡接着说：我们坚决主张在国际关系中采用和平共处的五项原则。我们相信，争执的国际问题可以通过协商的办法和平解决；建立巩固的、持久的和平的国际关系是具备了条件的。但是，决不能不注意到某些侵略集团正在想尽一切办法来继续执行煽动“冷战”的危险政策和“实力地位”政策，并且从这些据点来威胁社会主义阵营国家。这一切都使我们各国人民和所有爱好和平的人民不得不经常提高警惕。在这种国际条件下，我们各国在华沙条约范围内的紧密合作，我们各国根据这一条约在政治、经济和军事合作方面所采取的一致措施，对保卫我们各国人民的安全和建设性的和平劳动有极其重大的意义。
    斯托伊卡最后说，罗马尼亚人民共和国作为华沙条约的一个缔约国，将尽力完成它在捍卫我们的共同事业——保卫和平和国际安全的伟大事业方面所承担的任务。
    斯托伊卡发言结束以后，华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会第一次会议就告结束。
    下次会议将在28日上午10时举行。
