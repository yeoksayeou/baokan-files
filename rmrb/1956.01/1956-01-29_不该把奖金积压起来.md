Harbin Construction Bureau's Metal Structure Engineering Company received a bonus of 15,000 yuan in 1953. This bonus has been piled up for more than two years without being dealt with. Recently, they thought about dealing with it - using it to buy a large movie projector. This unreasonable suggestion was rejected by the higher authorities. This is not the first time this company has piled up bonuses. In 1954, they piled up a bonus of more than 2,000 yuan for more than a year.

The workers have repeatedly raised objections to this phenomenon. However, the company's leaders criticized the workers who raised objections as "individualistic."

May we ask the leading comrades of the Harbin Construction Bureau's Metal Structure Engineering Company, shouldn't workers be concerned about how the fruits of their labor are handled? Or are you lacking a mass perspective and forgetting the state's reward policy?

    不该把奖金积压起来
    哈尔滨建筑局金属结构工程公司在1953年得到了一笔15，000元的奖金。这笔奖金已经被积压了两年多没有处理。最近，他们想到处理了——用来买一架大电影机。这个不合理的建议提上去，就被上级驳了回来。这个公司积压奖金已不止这一次了。1954年，他们就曾把一笔两千多元的奖金积压了一年多。
    工人们对这种现象曾一再提出意见。但是，公司的领导人员却批评提意见的工人是“个人主义”。
    请问哈尔滨建筑局金属结构工程公司的领导同志，到底是工人对自己的劳动成果的处理情况不应该过问呢？还是你们缺少群众观点，忘记了国家的奖励政策？
