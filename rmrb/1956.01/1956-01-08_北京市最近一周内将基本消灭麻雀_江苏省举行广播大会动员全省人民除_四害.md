　　Beijing to Basically Eliminate Sparrows Within the Last Week
    Jiangsu Province Holds Broadcast Rally to Mobilize the People of the Province to Eliminate the "Four Pests"
    (Our Newspaper) News - The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League held a mobilization meeting for the sparrow-swatting blitz on January 7th, calling on Beijing youth to launch a sparrow-swatting blitz week starting January 7th, to basically eliminate sparrows in urban and suburban areas within a week.
    Zhang Jinlin, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee of the League, made a mobilization report at the meeting. He called on young people to extensively mobilize the masses and widely organize sparrow-swatting youth shock teams after returning, and to take action immediately.
    Duan Wenkui, a youth from Huoqi Camp Township, Lv Guoxin, a young worker from the East Suburb Winery, and youths from Qianmen, Dongsi and other districts introduced methods and experience in swatting sparrows at the meeting. They used the facts of their own township and unit to illustrate that eliminating sparrows is possible. The sparrows in Huoqi Camp Township were basically eliminated in eight days. They believed that there are many methods of catching and swatting, and that the most effective method is to shine a flashlight and catch them by hand, as sparrows mostly roost under the eaves, rafters, and leeward places at night. On snowy days, the best method is to use a sieve to trap them.
    More than 1,300 cadres from the League's grassroots organizations and sparrow-swatting activists who participated in the meeting responded to this call with full confidence.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th - The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Jiangsu Provincial People's Broadcasting Station jointly held a broadcast rally to eliminate the "Four Pests" (rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes) on the 6th. More than 40 wired broadcasting stations and more than 1,500 radio stations throughout the province, as well as the vast majority of youth league organizations in various places, rebroadcasted and organized listening. The person in charge of the Provincial Health Department announced a comprehensive plan to eliminate the "Four Pests" in the province within five to seven years at the meeting. Young activists from various places also introduced their experiences in eliminating the "Four Pests" at the meeting.
    Up to now, Xuzhou, Siyang, Xin Hailian and other 27 cities and counties in Jiangsu Province have captured about 400,000 sparrows and rats and dug out more than 54,000 catties of fly pupae in less than a month.

　　北京市最近一周内将基本消灭麻雀
    江苏省举行广播大会动员全省人民除“四害”
    本报讯　青年团北京市委员会在1月7日召开了打麻雀突击运动动员大会，号召北京市青年从1月7日起开展一个打麻雀突击运动周，在一周内把城区和郊区的麻雀基本消灭。
    团市委副书记张进霖在会上作了动员报告。他号召青年们回去以后要广泛发动群众，普遍组织打麻雀青年突击小组，立即开始行动。
    火器营乡青年段文奎、东郊酿酒厂青年工人吕国新以及前门、东四等区青年都在会上介绍了打麻雀的办法和经验。他们用本乡本单位的事实说明消灭麻雀是可能的，火器营乡的麻雀就是在八天内被基本上消灭了的。他们认为捕打办法很多，目前麻雀夜间大多宿在檐下、椽边和背风处，用手电筒照、手抓的办法最有效；下雪天，用筛子扣的办法最好。
    参加会议的1，300多名团基层组织的干部和打麻雀积极分子，都信心十足地响应了这一号召。
    据新华社南京7日电　青年团江苏省委员会和江苏省人民广播电台在6日联合举行了除“四害”（老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子）广播大会。全省40多个有线广播站和1，500多个收音站以及各地青年团组织绝大部分进行转播和组织收听。省卫生厅负责人在会上宣布了五年到七年内全省消灭“四害”的全面规划。各地青年积极分子也在会上介绍了除“四害”的经验。
    到目前为止，江苏省徐州、泗阳、新海连等27个市、县，在不到一个月的时间内已经捕捉麻雀和老鼠约40多万只，掘蝇蛹54，000多斤。
