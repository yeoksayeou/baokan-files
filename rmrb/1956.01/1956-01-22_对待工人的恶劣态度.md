To the Editor:

The administrative leaders of the Liaoning No. 4 State-owned Silk Reeling Factory have consistently failed to care about the workers' lives and well-being. The following are two prominent examples:

	Zhu Baoshan, a worker at this factory, contracted pulmonary tuberculosis in the spring of 1954, and his condition worsened in the autumn. On September 20th, he went to the factory's clinic for treatment and requested sick leave for recuperation or a referral to the employee hospital. However, his reasonable request was rejected, and the doctor insisted that he continue working. By October 25th, Zhu Baoshan began coughing up blood and requested sick leave for treatment five times; however, the doctor only granted him eight days of leave. After the leave expired, he had to go back to work while sick, and on February 21, 1955, he finally died because he did not receive treatment and rest.

	In the winter of 1954, a pregnant female worker, Sun Guixiu, suddenly had vaginal bleeding. After examination by the county health center, it was determined that there was a possibility of miscarriage and that she needed to be hospitalized for treatment. However, the factory clinic insisted that Sun Guixiu continue working. On March 4, 1955, she suddenly fainted while working in the workshop, and vaginal bleeding did not stop. She was carried to the clinic. The doctor, Zhou Zhenchang, said, "We can't handle this; refer her to the employee hospital," and immediately turned around and left. At that time, there was a strong wind outside, and it was very cold. Sun Guixiu, because no one paid attention to her, had to go home wearing pants soaked in blood, holding her stomach. After returning home, she miscarried, and Sun Guixiu also suffered from back pain and leg pain and has not been able to work ever since.

The reason why the Liaoning No. 4 Silk Reeling Factory's clinic treats workers in this way is inseparable from the ideological style of the factory's administrative leaders. The leaders of this factory once made a regulation that "employees' leave should not exceed 3 days" and often instructed the clinic to "strictly" "control" the approval of sick leave. Therefore, the clinic adopted the practice of "giving as little leave as possible, regardless of the patient's condition." When Zhu Baoshan and Sun Guixiu requested leave and were refused, it was precisely when the clinic was "strictly" "controlling" sick leave; it was also when the factory director praised the "clinic's work as successful." It is said that the reason why the leaders did this was to "ensure the completion of production tasks." May I ask: when Zhu Baoshan's condition deteriorated and his request for leave was not approved, when Sun Guixiu was refused help and miscarried, how could the workers work with peace of mind? How could "the completion of production tasks" be guaranteed?

In addition, the factory's nursery is poorly run, and some caregivers even arbitrarily abuse the children. For example, some caregivers do not bathe the children for a long time in the summer but use carbolic acid to "disinfect" them, burning five children in total. Some caregivers often tie the children to the bed and chat and fight outside the door. Some caregivers, when changing diapers, rudely grabbed the children's arms and lifted them up and down; as a result, the hand of female worker You Xilan's child was injured, and the child of female worker Sun Baolan got sick from fright. Caregiver Zhao Guilan once beat Liang Luanqin's child with a broom and threw the child on the bed, injuring his eyes, nose, and face. Many mothers cried sadly in the workshop. But the factory leaders may think that this has nothing to do with production and do not care even when they know about it.

Now, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China and the Liaoning Provincial Tussah Silk Company have discovered these many serious problems in this factory and are seriously dealing with them. However, we believe that this kind of ideological style that opposes completing tasks and caring about the workers' lives and well-being is not absent in other textile factories. The Liaoning No. 4 Silk Reeling Factory incident should arouse widespread vigilance! All-China Federation of Textile Workers' Trade Unions, Labor Insurance Department, Women Workers' Department

### 对待工人的恶劣态度

    对待工人的恶劣态度编辑同志：
    地方国营辽宁缫丝四厂行政领导方面一贯不关心工人生活疾苦。下面是两个突出的事例：
    这个厂的工人祝宝山1954年春天害了肺结核病，到了秋天病情转重。9月20日，他到工厂的卫生所看病，并且要求给假休养或者介绍到职工医院治疗。但是，他的合理要求却被拒绝了，医生一定要他坚持工作。到10月25日，祝宝山开始咯血了，前后5次到医务所要求给假治疗；但是，医生只给他8天假期。假期满后他只好带病上班，到1955年2月21日终于因为得不到治疗和休养而死亡了。
    1954年冬天，怀孕女工孙桂秀突然下部流血；经县的卫生院检查，认为有流产的可能，需要住院治疗。但是工厂卫生所却非要孙桂秀坚持工作不可。1955年3月4日，她在车间工作的时候突然晕倒，下部流血不止，被抬到卫生所。医生周振昌一看，说是“咱们不能处置，介绍到职工医院去”，马上转身就走了。当时外面刮大风，天很冷，孙桂秀因为没有人理睬她，只好穿着被血浸透了的裤子，按着肚子回家去。到家以后小孩就流产了，孙桂秀还从此得了腰酸腿疼病，一直不能上班。
    辽宁缫丝四厂卫生所之所以用这样的态度来对待工人，是和工厂行政领导人员的思想作风分不开的。这个厂的领导人曾经作出“职工请假不得超过3天”的规定，还经常责成卫生所对批准病假“掌握”得“严”一些。因此，卫生所就采取“不管病人情况怎样而给假越少越好”的做法。当祝宝山和孙桂秀要求给假而遭到拒绝的时候，正是卫生所“掌握”病假最“严”的时候；也正是厂长表扬“卫生所工作有成绩”的时候。据说，领导人员这样做的原因是为了“保证完成生产任务”。试问：当祝宝山的病情恶化而请假没有被批准的时候，当孙桂秀被拒绝帮助而流产得病的时候，工人们怎么能够安心生产呢？“完成生产任务”怎么会有保证呢？
    另外，这个工厂的托儿所办得很糟，有的保育员甚至任意虐待孩子们。例如，有的保育员夏季长期不给孩子洗澡，却用石炭酸给孩子“消毒”，前后共烧坏了5个孩子。有的保育员经常把孩子捆在床上，自己到门外闲扯和打闹。有的保育员在给孩子换尿布的时候，粗暴地抓住孩子的胳膊提来提去；就这样，女工尤喜兰的孩子的手被提伤了，女工孙宝兰的孩子受惊得了病。保育员赵桂兰曾经用笤帚毒打梁鸾琴的孩子，还把孩子摔在床上，碰伤了眼睛、鼻子和脸孔。很多妈妈们都在车间里伤心地哭。但是工厂的领导人可能认为这和生产没有关系，知道了也不过问。
    现在，中国纺织工会辽宁省委员会和辽宁省柞蚕丝绸公司已经发现这个工厂的这许多严重问题，正在进行严肃处理。但是我们认为，这种把完成任务同关心工人生活疾苦对立起来的思想作风，在其他的纺织厂里并不是没有的。辽宁缫丝四厂的事件，应该引起普遍的警惕！中国纺织工会全国委员会  劳动保险部女工部
