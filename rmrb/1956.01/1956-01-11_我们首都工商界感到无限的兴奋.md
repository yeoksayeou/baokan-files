    Our Capital's Industrial and Commercial Circles Feel Boundless Excitement
    Le Songsheng, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce

    The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in Beijing has reached a climax. As of yesterday, the municipal government has approved the joint state-private ownership of 35 industrial sectors and 42 commercial, catering, and service sectors, including shopkeepers and some family-run businesses. This is a great joyous occasion for the industrial and commercial circles of the capital. We industrialists and businessmen feel boundless excitement and express our utmost gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao.

    After the implementation of joint state-private ownership in various sectors, comrades in industrial and commercial circles should further promote their enthusiasm for accepting socialist transformation. Under the leadership of the state representatives and the supervision of the working masses, we should take the initiative to do a good job in asset inventory and valuation based on the principles of "fairness, reasonableness, and seeking truth from facts." At the same time, we must ensure that joint operation and business are not delayed. The leaders have instructed that the following five points should be noted during the joint state-private ownership: (1) the variety of products should not be reduced; (2) the volume of sales should not be reduced; (3) the quality of service should be improved; (4) procedures should be simplified; and (5) costs should be reduced. We must all guarantee the realization of the above five requirements, to serve production and serve consumers. At the same time, we must combine enterprise transformation with conscientious ideological remolding, recognize the laws of social development, take the initiative to master our own destiny, and in future business practices, strive to learn skills, gradually abandon exploitation, transform ourselves into glorious working people, and contribute our strength to the great socialist construction and socialist transformation of our motherland.

    On this grand joyous occasion, we should celebrate enthusiastically, celebrating the rapid development of the glorious and great socialist cause of the motherland. Let us cheer:

    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

    我们首都工商界感到无限的兴奋
    北京市工商业联合会主任委员　乐松生
    北京市对资本主义工商业进行社会主义的改造工作，已经达到了高潮。到昨天，本市35个工业行业和42个商业、饮食和服务性行业的座商和部分连家铺，都蒙政府批准了公私合营。这是首都工商界的大喜事，我们工商业者感到无限兴奋，对中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛主席表示万分的感激。
    在各行业实行公私合营以后，工商界的同志们应该进一步发挥接受社会主义改造的积极性，在公方领导下，工人群众的监督下，根据“公平合理、实事求是”的原则，主动地做好清产估价工作，同时要作到合营、业务两不误。首长曾经指示在公私合营时要注意下列五项：（一）品种不减少；（二）流水不减少；（三）服务质量要提高；（四）手续要简化；（五）费用要降低。我们大家一定要保证实现以上的五项要求，为生产服务，为消费者服务。同时，我们要结合企业改造，认真地进行思想改造，认清社会发展规律，主动地掌握自己的命运，在今后的经营实践中，努力学习本领，逐步放弃剥削，把自己改造成为光荣的劳动人民，为我们祖国伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业贡献自己的力量。
    今逢盛大的喜事，我们应当热烈的庆祝，庆祝祖国光荣伟大的社会主义事业的飞速发展。让我们欢呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
