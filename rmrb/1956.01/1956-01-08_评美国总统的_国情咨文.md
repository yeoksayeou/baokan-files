　　Commentary on the US President's "State of the Union Address"
    On January 5th, US President Eisenhower, as usual, presented his annual "State of the Union Address" to Congress.

    Dulles called 1955 a year of "constant change"; Eisenhower also said: "In everything, change is the relentless law of life." Indeed, the international situation in the past year has presented the US ruling group with a series of new problems. Where is the United States going? Will the United States strive to ease the international situation, or will it instead create division and antagonism between countries, making the international situation tense? Will the United States agree to universal disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons, or will it cling to the long-bankrupt and universally condemned "policy of strength" and continue to struggle? Will the United States recognize the reality of Asia and Africa, respect the national aspirations of these countries, or will it continue to pursue its old policies?

    The "State of the Union Address," outlining the US government's plans for the new year, provides answers to these questions.

    The "State of the Union Address" states: the United States "must continue to maintain an effective system of collective security. This includes two things—a system that issues a clear warning that armed aggression will be met with the united action of free nations, and a deterrent military force that makes that warning effective. In addition, the power of the atom must be made a defender of the free world and peace."

    The drafters of the "State of the Union Address" continue to advocate the policy of strength with such rare enthusiasm. This shows that the US ruling group has lost the most basic reaction to the reality around it. Instead of intending to abandon the already bankrupt political strategy, they want to strengthen this strategy; instead of intending to stop organizing military blocs and expanding armaments and preparing for war, they want to "save" the "policy of strength," which is running into snags everywhere, by accelerating preparations for atomic war. However, if this policy suffered a serious setback in 1955, then the US ruling group can hardly expect it to improve the US's international position in 1956. The whole key to the problem is that when the people of the world are so strongly demanding peaceful coexistence and strengthening international cooperation, the United States is trying to deepen the antagonism between countries and continue to intensify the "Cold War." This policy can only make the United States increasingly isolated in international affairs.

    The US ruling group is also attempting to strengthen certain measures, such as increasing foreign "economic aid," to adapt to the new international situation, especially the situation in Asia. The "State of the Union Address" announces that "we must maintain and strengthen our common security programs," especially "assistance" to "underdeveloped areas." The US President requested Congress to "grant limited authority to undertake long-term obligations to assist in such facilities, to be fulfilled by appropriations in future fiscal years." The "Address" also emphasized: "These different steps will greatly strengthen the economic foundation of our foreign policy." This provides a wonderful annotation on the nature and purpose of US "aid."

    The US ruling group attaches particular importance to "aid" to the Asian region because recently, the economic relations between Asian countries and the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp have developed extensively. The Soviet Union's economic and technical assistance to Asian countries, based on non-interference in internal affairs and equality and mutual benefit, stands in stark contrast to US "aid." This has caused a serious crisis in the US's aggressive policy in Asia. Today, the public in Asian countries is increasingly aware that accepting US "aid" means being dragged into a destructive military race, being dragged into military blocs and losing national sovereignty, and means making oneself forever a backward agricultural country and becoming a market for US commodities and a supplier of raw materials.

    What conclusion should be drawn from this? Since the public in Asian countries, who cherish and safeguard national sovereignty, are unwilling to wear the shackles of the United States, then even more dollars cannot save the failure of US policy in Asia.

    It is very clear that the "State of the Union Address" does not provide a real way out for the United States. Continuing to pursue the "policy of strength" can neither help the United States postpone the inevitable economic crisis nor improve its international position. If the US ruling group underestimates the will of the peace-loving people of the world and underestimates the desire of the Asian people to safeguard national independence and national interests, then it will suffer even greater failures in 1956.

### 评美国总统的“国情咨文”

　　评美国总统的“国情咨文”
    1月5日，美国总统艾森豪威尔照例向国会提出一年一度的“国情咨文”。
    杜勒斯把1955年称为“千变万化”的一年；艾森豪威尔也说：“在一切事情中，变是冷酷无情的生活法则。”的确过去一年来的国际形势，为美国的统治集团提出了一连串的新问题。美国往何处去？美国究竟是努力缓和国际局势呢，还是相反地制造国与国之间的分裂和对立，使国际局势紧张起来，美国将同意普遍地裁减军备和禁止原子武器呢，还是抱住早已破产并受到普遍谴责的“实力政策”继续挣扎？美国将承认亚非地区的现实，尊重这些国家的民族愿望呢，还是照旧推行它的老政策？
    叙述美国政府新的一年的计划的“国情咨文”，为这些问题提供了答案。
    “国情咨文”说：美国“必须继续保持一个集体安全的有效体系。这包含两个东西——一个提出明确警告说对于武装侵略将以自由国家的联合行动来对付的体系，以及使那种警告发生效力的威慑性军事力量。此外，必须使原子的威力成为自由世界和和平的防卫者”。
    “国情咨文”的起草人以如此少有的热情，继续鼓吹奉行实力政策。这就说明，美国统治集团对于它周围的现实丧失了最起码的反应。他们不但不打算放弃已经破产了的政治方针，反而想加强这种方针；他们不但不打算停止组织军事集团和扩军备战的作法，并且想以加速准备原子战争来“挽救”到处碰壁的“实力政策”。但是，如果说这种政策在1955年遭到了严重的挫败，那么，美国的统治集团也决难指望它来改善美国在1956年的国际地位。问题的全部关键在于：当全世界人民如此强烈地要求和平共处和加强国际合作的时候，美国却企图加深国与国之间的对立和继续加剧“冷战”。这种政策，只能使美国在国际事务中愈来愈加孤立。
    美国统治集团也企图强化某些措施，例如增加对外“经济援助”，以适应新的国际局势，特别是亚洲的局势。“国情咨文”宣布“必须保持和加强我们的共同安全计划”，特别是对“落后地区”的“援助”。美国总统请求国会“授以有限的权力来承担对这种设施进行援助的长期义务，以未来的几个财政年度的拨款来加以履行”。“咨文”还强调指出：“这些不同的步骤将大大地加强我们的外交政策的经济基础。”这就对美国“援助”的本质和目的作了一个绝妙的注解。
    美国统治集团特别重视对亚洲地区的“援助”，是由于最近以来，亚洲国家同苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的经济关系有了广泛的发展。建立在互不干涉内政和平等互利基础上的苏联对亚洲国家的经济和技术帮助，同美国的“援助”构成了强烈的对比。这就使美国在亚洲的侵略政策发生了严重的危机。在今天，亚洲各国的公众越来越清楚地看到：接受美“援”就意味着被拖入毁灭性的军事竞赛，被拖入军事集团和丧失国家的主权，意味着使自己永远成为落后的农业国并沦为美国的商品销售市场和原料供应者。
    由此应该得出什么结论呢？既然珍视和维护国家主权的亚洲各国公众不愿带上美国的桎梏，那么，即使是再多的美元，也不可能挽救美国政策在亚洲的失败。
    十分清楚，“国情咨文”并没有为美国提供一条真正的出路。继续奉行“实力政策”，既不能帮助美国推迟不可避免的经济危机，也不能改善它的国际地位。美国统治集团如果低估全世界爱好和平人民的意志，低估亚洲人民维护国家独立和民族利益的愿望，那末它在1956年将会遭到更大的失败。
