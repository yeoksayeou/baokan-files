Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th -- Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recently answered questions posed by a reporter from Agence France-Presse.

In answering the questions, Phạm Văn Đồng reminded French and world public opinion to pay attention to the provocative policies openly clamored for by the South Vietnamese authorities and their preparations for a new war. He pointed out that this policy is inseparable from the United States' interference in South Vietnam and its attempt to include South Vietnam within the "protected area" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in which France participates.

Phạm Văn Đồng said that this policy means the cancellation of the Geneva Accords signed between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and France. We demand that the French government recognize its responsibility for the agreements it signed. The Vietnamese people resolutely oppose such a policy because it violates the Geneva Accords and violates the program of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, which advocates the peaceful reunification of Vietnam on the basis of independence and democracy.

When talking about the position of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the "elections" to be held in South Vietnam, Phạm Văn Đồng said that this so-called "election" violates the letter and spirit of the Geneva Accords, violates the desire of the Vietnamese people for a unified country, and violates the basic principles of democracy and legality. Only elections prepared and held within the scope of the Geneva Accords will have value and will be supported by the Vietnamese people.

    范文同答记者问
    新华社河内17日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同在最近答复了法新社记者所提出的问题。
    范文同在回答问题时提醒法国舆论和世界舆论注意南越当局公开叫嚣的挑衅和准备新战争的政策。他指出，这个政策是和美国干涉南越、企图把南越列入有法国参加的东南亚条约组织“保护范围”内的阴谋分不开的。
    范文同说，这个政策意味着取消越南民主共和国和法国间签订的日内瓦协议。我们要求法国政府认清对自己签订的协议的责任。越南人民坚决反对这样的政策，因为它违背日内瓦协议，违背主张在独立和民主的基础上通过和平方式实现越南的统一的越南祖国战线纲领。
    范文同在谈到越南民主共和国政府对南越将要举行的“选举”的立场时说，这个所谓“选举”，是违反日内瓦协议的文字和精神的，是违反越南人民统一国家的愿望的，是违反民主和法理的基本原则的。只有按照日内瓦协议的范围准备和举行的选举，才会有价值，才会受到越南人民的拥护。
