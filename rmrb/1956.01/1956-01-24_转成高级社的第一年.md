    The First Year After Transitioning to an Advanced Cooperative
    Han En
    Our "Road to Happiness" Agricultural Production Cooperative transitioned from a primary cooperative to an advanced cooperative in January 1955. In the first year after the transition, we achieved significant production results. In 1955, the total grain output reached 1,439,910 jin (excluding potatoes and oil crops), exceeding the original plan by 6.6%, with an increase of 89,900 jin of grain. Each labor day could be distributed 2.31 yuan. The average income of each medium-level laborer was about 500 yuan, doubling that of 1954.

    After transitioning from a primary cooperative to an advanced cooperative, the most significant change in our cooperative was that all members wanted to have work to do every day. Many women, semi-laborers, and primary school students who had never worked in the fields also rushed to work. Gao Wanku, who used to be habitually lazy, didn't take a single day off throughout the year. Chi Dianwu, who originally didn't want to work, also mobilized all the male and female laborers in his family to work in the fields; the whole family did more than 600 labor days in a year. He said, "After transitioning to the advanced cooperative, I don't know where the energy came from; when I started working, I didn't feel tired."

    In order to meet the requirements of the members, we strengthened planned management. Just after transitioning to the advanced cooperative, we formulated production plans, financial plans, and labor plans based on the needs of the cooperative's 113 hectares of paddy fields, 131 hectares of dry land, and other various productions. According to the production plan, the cooperative needed 40,800 labor days throughout the year; the total number of labor days that all members reported they could do throughout the year was 870 more than the number of labor days planned by the cooperative. We used these surplus labor days in a planned way for agricultural capital construction and improvement of agricultural technology. In terms of capital construction, we converted 6 hectares of dry land with better soil quality and flat terrain into paddy fields, increasing the planting area of rice. The 6 hectares of paddy fields yielded 24,000 jin more grain than the 6 hectares of dry land. We also cultivated more than 30 hectares of virgin land opened up with the help of the state's tractors, increasing the grain output by more than 60,000 jin. In terms of improving agricultural technology, we disinfected all the seeds before spring plowing. During planting, we launched a campaign to shorten the sowing period, and the entire cooperative finished sowing 6 days earlier than in 1954. Because we achieved early and timely sowing, the crops matured early this year, avoiding the frost damage that had occurred every year for many years. When planting rice, we created the "grid-planting method," which improved the speed and quality of rice transplanting and increased the number of rice plants, increasing by 25,000 to more than 30,000 clusters per hectare compared to 1954. The 113 hectares of rice fields yielded an average of more than 9,000 jin per hectare, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest.

    Due to the active labor of all members and the strengthening of planned management, the labor productivity of the members significantly increased this year. Each member of the cooperative worked an average of 194 labor days, an increase of 17% compared to 1954, and the highest increase was 30%. The utilization rate of livestock has also increased. In 1955, each animal was used for an average of 282 days, an increase of 30 to 46 days compared to 1954. The efficiency of agricultural implements has also increased. In 1954, each cart was used for an average of 120 days, and in 1955 it reached 160 days.

    Judging from our one-year production results, although the advanced cooperative abolished land dividends and lowered investment interest (when transitioning to the advanced cooperative, we lowered the investment interest rate to nine percent), because we implemented the socialist distribution principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," greatly improved labor efficiency, and increased production, members who had more land and larger investments in the past still increased their income. For example, Niu Defang had one hectare of land and 400 yuan of investment. In 1954, his total income from land dividends and investment interest was 82 yuan. In 1955, there were no land dividends and the interest was reduced, a total reduction of 46 yuan; but his labor income increased by 364 yuan compared to 1954. Members with more labor and stronger labor increased their income even more. Members with weak labor also received normal income because the cooperative planned to assist them in various ways. For example, Wang Xijiang, a one-armed disabled veteran, also earned more than 200 labor days, with an income of nearly 500 yuan.

    转成高级社的第一年
    韩恩
    我们“幸福之路”农业生产合作社，是在1955年1月由初级社转成高级社的。在转成高级社的第一年，就获得了显著的生产成绩。1955年粮食总产量达到1，439，910斤（薯类和油料作物不计算在内），超过原订计划的6.6％，增产粮食89，900斤。每个劳动日可分2.31元。每个中等劳力平均收入500元左右，比1954年增加了一倍。
    从初级社转变为高级社以后，我们合作社的一个最显著的变化，就是全体社员都要求天天有活干。许多从来没有下过地的妇女、半劳力、小学生也都抢着下地干活。过去一贯爱歇工的郜万库，一年中一个工也没有歇。原来不愿劳动的迟殿武，也动员了全家男女劳力下地劳动；全家一年共做了600多个劳动日。他说：“转高级社以后，我不知道哪来的那股劲，干起活来，就不知道累。”
    为了满足社员的要求，我们加强了计划管理。刚转成高级社，就按着全社113垧水田和131垧旱田和别的各种生产的需要，订出了生产计划、财务计划和劳动计划。按照生产计划，全社全年需工40，800个；全体社员自报全年可以做的工数比社内计划用的工数多870个。这些剩余的工数，我们有计划地用到了农业基本建设和改进农业技术方面。在基本建设方面，我们把社内土质较好、地势平坦的6垧旱田改成了水田，增加了水稻的播种面积。6垧水田比6垧旱田多收了24，000斤粮食。我们还垦种了国家用拖拉机帮助开垦的30多垧生荒，共增加了6万多斤粮食。在改进农业技术方面，我们在春耕前把所有的种子都进行了消毒。种地的时候，开展了缩短播种期运动，全社的土地比1954年提前6天结束播种。由于作到了提前适时播种，这一年农作物成熟期早，避免了多年来每年遭受的霜冻灾害。种水稻的时候，我们创造了“划格插秧法”，提高了插秧速度和工作质量，增加了水稻株数，每垧比1954年增加25，000到3万多簇。113垧水稻，平均每垧产9，000斤以上，获得了从来没有的大丰收。
    由于全体社员积极劳动，又加强了计划管理，这一年社员劳动生产率显著提高。全社每个社员平均作了194个劳动日，比1954年提高了17％，最高的提高了30％。牲畜运用率也提高了。1955年每头牲口平均使用282天，比1954年增加了30天到46天。农具使用的效率也提高了。1954年每辆大车平均使用120天，1955年达到160天。
    从我们一年的生产结果来看，高级社虽然取消了土地报酬，降低了投资利息（转高级社的时候，我们把投资利率降低到九厘），但是，因为实行了“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的社会主义分配原则，大大提高了劳动效率，增加了生产，所以过去土地多、投资大的社员还是增加了收入。如牛德芳，他有一垧地和400元的投资，1954年土地报酬和投资利息收入共82元。1955年土地报酬没有了，利息减少了，一共减少了46元；但是他的劳动收入比1954年增加了364元。劳力多、劳力强的社员收入增加得更多。劳力弱的社员，由于社里有计划地从各方面对他们加以扶助，也得到了正常的收入。如一只手的荣誉军人王喜江，也得了200多个劳动日，收入近500元。
