    The Packaging of Two-Wheel Double-Share Plows Must Be Economical and Good

    (I) Editor:
    The packaging cost of each two-wheel double-share plow at the Shanxi Machinery Factory has now been reduced from 3.5 yuan to 0.64 yuan; the packaging cost of each two-wheel double-share plow at the Xuzhou Iron Factory is only 0.68 yuan. However, the packaging costs of two-wheel double-share plows at some agricultural machinery factories are still very high. For example, the packaging cost of each two-wheel double-share plow at the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory is 1.52 yuan; the packaging cost of each two-wheel double-share plow at the Bengbu Iron Factory is 1.45 yuan. Of course, the packaging costs of two-wheel double-share plows cannot be exactly the same at present due to the distance of transportation and different packaging conditions. However, these factories with high costs should indeed study the use of sturdy and inexpensive packaging materials and improve packaging methods in order to save packaging costs and reduce the prices of agricultural implements.

    (II) Editor:
    On December 15, 1955, a batch of two-wheel double-share plows manufactured by the Lingshan Agricultural Machinery Factory was transported to Jiaozuo Railway Station. Two 30-ton railway cars were loaded with a total of six hundred plows. Due to poor packaging, many parts were lost from this batch of agricultural implements; only those picked up near the station included 51 cotter pins, 15 vertical adjustment cradles, nine tillage depth adjusters, as well as ground wheel, furrow wheel axles and axle retaining hoop rivets.
    It is hoped that while paying attention to reducing the packaging costs of two-wheel double-share plows, the Lingshan Agricultural Machinery Factory will also ensure the quality of the packaging.

    双轮双铧犁的包装要做到又省又好
    （一）编辑同志：
    山西机器厂每部双轮双铧犁的包装费用，现在已经由3.5元降低到0.64元；徐州铁工厂的每部双轮双铧犁的包装费用，也只有0.68元。但是，有些农具制造厂的双轮双铧犁的包装费用还很高。例如，北京农业机械厂的每部双轮双铧犁包装费用是1.52元；蚌埠铁工厂的每部双轮双铧犁包装费用是1.45元。当然，双轮双铧犁的包装费用，由于运输路程有远近，包装条件不同，目前还不能完全一样。但是这些费用高的工厂确实应该研究使用坚固价廉的包装器材，改进包装方法，以节省包装费用，降低农具价格。

    （二）编辑同志：
    1955年12月15日，有一批灵山农业机械厂制造的双轮双铧犁运到焦作车站，两个30吨的车皮共装了六百部。这批农具由于包装不良，丢了许多零件；光是从车站附近捡回来的，就有插销51个，立调节卡座15个，耕深调节器九个，还有地轮、沟轮轴和轴挡箍铆钉。
    希望灵山农业机械厂在注意降低双轮双铧犁的包装费用的同时，还要保证包装的质量。
