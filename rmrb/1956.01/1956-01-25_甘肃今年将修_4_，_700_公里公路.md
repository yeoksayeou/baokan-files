    Gansu Province plans to construct 4,700 kilometers of simple highways in agricultural areas this year. This figure is more than four times the total length of highways built in Gansu Province in the six years since liberation. By the end of this year, all counties and cities in the province, except for individual counties in the Wuwei area, will be accessible by car. Most agricultural townships and some key agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province will also be accessible by car.
    Currently, relevant departments in Gansu Province are actively preparing for highway construction. In addition to dispatching eight highway route survey teams and a number of road construction and maintenance technicians to various regions, the Gansu Provincial Department of Transportation will also train a group of junior road construction technicians and plans to train 10,000 rural activists and village cadres, equipping them with basic road construction knowledge to take charge of road construction leadership in various townships.

    甘肃今年将修4，700公里公路
    甘肃省今年将在农业地区修筑简易公路4，700公里。这个数字比甘肃省解放6年来所修公路的总和还多四倍以上。到今年年底，全省各县市，除武都专区的个别县以外，将全部通行汽车。全省大部分农业乡和一些重点农业生产合作社也都可通汽车。
    现在甘肃省有关方面正在积极进行修筑公路的准备工作。甘肃省交通厅除了向各地派出八个公路线路勘查组和一部分筑路养路技术人员以外，还将训练一批初级筑路技术人员，并且计划训练一万名农村积极分子和乡村干部，使他们具有筑路的初步知识，以便担负各乡的筑路领导工作。
