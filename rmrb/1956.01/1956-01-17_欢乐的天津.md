January 15th, Tianjin was filled with festive joy throughout the day.

In the early morning, firecrackers echoed through the streets and alleys of the city. Factories and shops were decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, and drums and gongs resounded everywhere, celebrating the victory that had been achieved in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Report teams appeared on the streets one after another, carrying huge portraits of Chairman Mao and golden large "?" characters, forming a mighty parade, delivering the good news to every industrial and commercial household approved for joint state-private ownership and to all citizens. Hundreds of machine factories and iron foundries concentrated on Santiaoshi Street in the Hongqiao District celebrated like it was a grand occasion, with red banners celebrating joint state-private ownership strung together from door to door.

In recent days, many capitalists, in order to welcome the arrival of the good days of joint ownership, have taken the initiative to take stock of their assets and rush to prepare inventories. Some have expressed their intention to invest off-book assets into the enterprise, and others have put forward suggestions for improving production.

Employees of private enterprises were even more elated. In today's parade, the employees' enthusiasm was the most fervent. When they met the parade of shop assistants, workers from joint state-private factories, and handicraftsmen, they embraced and shook hands, jointly celebrating the victory. While celebrating the joint ownership of enterprises, the employees' enthusiasm for production was even greater. Workers from 48 factories in the Chengxiang District, including metal wire, chemical, and refractory materials factories, all proposed guarantees that joint ownership and production would not be hindered. Many workers at the Dali Electric Motor Factory created new production records on the same day that private industry was approved for complete joint ownership. Female worker Sun Peiyu used to assemble 180 glue cap switches a day, but on the 14th she assembled 260.

Recently, news has been constantly coming in that employees of state-owned and local state-owned factories across the city are guaranteeing to complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. In the past two days, the news that private industry and commerce across the city will implement joint state-private ownership and that handicrafts across the city will soon achieve cooperation has spread throughout the city, which is even more inspiring. Just as Tianjin Municipal People's Congress representative Mu Zhifang said: In the past, I imagined that someone like me, who is almost 70 years old, might not catch up with the good days of socialism, but that is not the case. Now I see socialism getting closer and closer. (Attached picture)

The young capitalists of Tianjin organized a 3,000-person reporting team on January 12 to celebrate joint state-private ownership and reported the good news to the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee.

    欢乐的天津
    新华社记者　孟庆杰　朱梅
    1月15日，天津市人民整日欢腾在节日的空气中。
    清晨，市内大街小巷就响起了鞭炮声，接着工厂、商店都悬灯结彩，到处锣鼓喧天，庆祝对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造所已经取得的胜利。报喜队陆续出现在街头，他们抬着毛主席的巨像和金色大“?”字，组成了浩浩荡荡的游行行列，把喜讯送给每个被批准公私合营的工商业户和全市市民。集中在红桥区三条石大街的几百家机器厂和铸铁厂像办大喜事一样，庆祝公私合营的红幛挨户地串连起来。
    这些天来，许多资本家为了迎接合营的好日子到来，主动地清点资产，赶制清册，有些人表示要把帐外资产投入企业，还有些人提出了改进生产的建议。
    私营企业的职工更是欢欣鼓舞。在今天的游行行列中，职工们的情绪最热烈。他们和广大店员、公私合营工厂的工人、手工业者的游行队伍相遇的时候，互相拥抱握手，共同欢庆胜利。在庆祝企业合营的同时，职工们的生产劲头更足了。城厢区金属线材、化工、耐火器材等48个工厂的工人，都提出合营、生产两不误的保证。大力电机厂许多工人在私营工业被批准全部合营的当天创造了生产新纪录，女工孙佩玉装配胶盖开关原来一天只能作180个，在14日她装配了260个。
    最近，全市国营和地方国营工厂职工保证提前一年完成五年计划的消息不断传来。这两天，全市私营工商业实行公私合营、全市手工业即将实现合作化的消息又散布到全市，更加令人振奋。正像天津市人民代表大会代表穆芝房说的：过去我想像我这样快70岁的人许是赶不上社会主义的好日子，其实不然，现在我看到社会主义越来越近了。（附图片）
