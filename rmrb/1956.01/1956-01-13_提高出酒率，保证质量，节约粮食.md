Increase Alcohol Yield, Ensure Quality, Save Grain
Li Yisan, Deputy Director of the Food Industry Bureau, Ministry of Local Industries

Our country's brewing industry has a long history. Guizhou Moutai, Shanxi Fenjiu, Shaoxing rice wine, Luzhou Daqu and other famous wines enjoy a high reputation internationally. In the past few years, under the leadership of governments at all levels, the brewing industry has continuously improved technology, added equipment, exchanged experience, and improved business management. It has made considerable progress in increasing alcohol yield and starch utilization, and adopting non-grain new wine sources to save grain. For example, the use of non-grain new wine sources in 1955 accounted for 28.5% of all brewing raw materials, more than double that of 1953.

However, due to the different equipment, technical levels, management levels and brewing methods of distilleries in various places, there are still many problems in the brewing industry. The most important of these is the large difference in alcohol yield among distilleries, low starch utilization, and serious waste of grain. According to statistics for the first half of 1955: the national average alcohol yield per 100 jin of dried sweet potatoes was 41.18 jin, and the starch utilization rate was only 54.8%. The highest alcohol yield (Yantai Distillery in Shandong) was 55.87 jin, and the lowest (small distilleries in Jiangsu) was 30.97 jin. The national average alcohol yield per 100 jin of sorghum was 36.17 jin, and the starch utilization rate was only 52.2%. The highest alcohol yield was 47.75 jin, and the lowest was 28 jin. From the above figures, it can be seen that the difference between the highest and the lowest alcohol yield is about 20 jin. If we compare the national average alcohol production level with the highest alcohol yield of Yantai Distillery, the national waste of grain is about 200,000 tons per year. Therefore, the First National Brewing Industry Conference held in November 1955 decided to promote the advanced experience of Yantai Distillery throughout the country, requiring an increase of two to four jin of alcohol per 100 jin of grain.

The advanced experience of Yantai Distillery is to use the method of "low-temperature fermentation, fixed-temperature steaming, and green koji plus yeast" to achieve the purpose of increasing alcohol yield. This advanced experience has been appraised by national brewing experts and is considered practical and feasible. Distilleries that earnestly study and promote this advanced experience can improve their alcohol yield. For example, since Shandong Province began to promote it in 1951, the average alcohol yield has increased from about 39% to about 48%.

The production methods of the brewing industry are backward, the cultural level of employees is not high, and in the past there was not enough education for employees. Therefore, conservative arguments such as "the current alcohol yield of the native distilleries has reached its peak and cannot be increased any further" exist in almost every factory. Therefore, to promote the advanced experience of Yantai Distillery, it is necessary to constantly educate workers, commend advanced individuals, and repeatedly criticize conservative ideas. In the process of promotion, we must also pay attention to improving the brewing technical level of employees. In order to ensure the promotion of advanced experience, various places can establish a bacteria culture station in the original large-scale distilleries to supply strains to nearby areas; and establish several testing stations according to the distribution of factories. Factories can also purchase necessary testing instruments to guide production with scientific methods. In order to save grain and ensure the promotion of advanced experience, in seasons when the temperature is too high, production can be appropriately suspended for one or two months without affecting market supply, and this time can be used to organize employees to learn operation methods.

The National Brewing Industry Conference also decided to gradually use tuber and fruit and other non-grain new wine sources to replace grain for brewing. In this way, together with the promotion of Yantai Distillery's advanced experience to improve starch utilization, a total of 125,000 tons of grain can be saved for the country in 1956. The meeting also decided to strengthen the reorganization and transformation of private brewing industry.

When using new wine sources for brewing, attention should be paid to product quality. In the past year, some units, when adopting new raw materials, rushed to promote them without good scientific analysis and experimentation, resulting in a decline in the quality of some wines, such as turbid color, incorrect odor, and dizziness after drinking. This National Brewing Industry Conference has formulated quality standards and acceptance systems. The most important thing at present is to consolidate the achievements of using new wine sources for brewing, pay attention to improving technology, and improve quality, in order to create favorable conditions for the large-scale promotion and use of non-grain wine sources in the future.

Strengthening the socialist transformation of the private brewing industry is a very important task. In 1955, the output of beverage wine from the private brewing industry accounted for 44.8%. In East China, Central South, and Southwest provinces, the proportion of the private brewing industry is even greater. The private brewing industry has a large number of households, small scale, decentralized operations, simple equipment, and backward technology. In the past, it has always been in a state of unattended management, and advanced experience cannot be promoted. Therefore, the alcohol yield is low and the waste of grain is serious. For example, in Jiangsu Province, the alcohol yield of sorghum in private distilleries is only 34%, the alcohol yield of barley is only 28%, and the alcohol yield of sweet potatoes is less than 30%. Some private distilleries also engage in adulteration. In the future, it is necessary to implement unified leadership over these private distilleries and workshops, manage them, reorganize and transform them, increase alcohol yield, and save grain.

### 提高出酒率，保证质量，节约粮食

    提高出酒率，保证质量，节约粮食
    地方工业部食品工业局副局长  李益三
    我国酿酒工业有着悠久的历史。贵州茅台、山西汾酒、绍兴黄酒、泸州大曲等名酒在国际上都享有声誉。几年来，酿酒工业在各级政府的领导下，不断改进技术，增添设备，交流经验，改善经营管理，在提高出酒率和淀粉利用率，采用非粮食类新酒源以节约粮食等方面都取得了不小成绩。例如1955年使用的非粮食类新酒源占全部酿酒原料的28.5％，比1953年增加了一倍多。
    但是，由于各地酒厂的设备不同，技术水平、管理水平和酿酒方法不同，目前酿酒工业还有很多问题。其中最主要的是各地酒厂的出酒率悬殊，淀粉利用率低，浪费粮食现象严重。根据1955年上半年统计：每百斤甘薯干全国平均出酒41.18斤，淀粉利用率只达54.8％，出酒最高的（山东烟台酒厂）是55.87斤，最低的（江苏小酒）是30.97斤。每百斤高粱全国平均出酒36.17斤，淀粉利用率只达52.2％，出酒最高的是47.75斤，最低的是28斤。从以上数字可以看出，出酒率最高的同最低的比较竟相差20斤左右。如果以全国产酒一般水平和出酒率最高的烟台酒厂比较，全国每年浪费的粮食约在20万吨以上。因此，1955年11月份召开的全国第一届酿酒工业会议上决定，要在全国范围内推广烟台酒厂的先进经验，要求每百斤粮食多出二斤到四斤酒。
    烟台酒厂的先进经验，就是用“低温发酵、定温蒸烧、绿曲加酵母”的方法，达到提高出酒率的目的。这一先进经验，已经由全国酿酒专家鉴定，认为是切实可行的。凡是认真学习和推广这一先进经验的酒厂，出酒率都能提高。如山东全省1951年开始推广以来，平均出酒率已经由39％提高到48％左右。
    酿酒工业的生产方式落后，职工文化水平不高，过去又对职工教育不够，所以认为“土烧锅现在的出酒率已经到顶了，没法再提高了”等保守论调，差不多在每一个厂里都有。因此，要推广烟台酒厂的先进经验，就必须经常教育工人，表扬先进人物，反复批判保守思想。在推广中，还要经常注意提高职工的酿造技术水平。为了保证先进经验的推广，各地可以在原有的大型酿酒厂中建立一个培菌站，以便给附近地区供应菌种；并且根据工厂分布情况，分别建立若干化验站。工厂也可以购置必要的化验仪器，以便用科学方法来指导生产。为了节约粮食，保证先进经验的推广，在温度太高的季节，可以在不影响市场供应的情况下，酌量停产一、两个月，利用这个时间组织职工学习操作法。
    全国酿酒工业会议还决定逐步利用薯类和果品等非粮食类新酒源代替粮食酿酒。这样，连同推广烟台酒厂先进经验提高淀粉利用率，1956年一年共可为国家节约粮食125，000吨。会议并且决定加强对私营酿酒工业的改组和改造工作。
    在利用新酒源酿酒的时候，应该注意产品质量。近一年来，有些单位在采用新原料的时候，由于没有经过很好的科学分析，试验，就匆忙推广，使得部分酒的质量下降，如颜色混浊，气味不正，喝了头晕等。这次全国酿酒工业会议制定了质量标准、验收制度。当前最重要的是巩固现在利用新酒源酿酒的成就，注意改进技术，提高质量，为将来大量推广使用非粮食酒源创造有利条件。
    加强对私营酿酒工业的社会主义改造是一个十分重要的任务。1955年饮料酒的产量中，私营酿酒业占44.8％。在华东、中南、西南各省，私营酿酒业的比重更大。私营酿酒业户数多、规模小、经营分散、设备简陋、技术落后，过去一向处于无人管理状态，先进经验不能推广，因此出酒率低，浪费粮食现象严重。例如江苏省私营酒坊高粱出酒率仅达34％，大麦出酒率仅达28％，甘薯出酒率不到30％。有的私营酒坊还有掺假行为。今后必须对这些私营酒厂、酒坊实行统一领导，把它们管理起来，加以改组和改造，提高出酒率，节约粮食。
