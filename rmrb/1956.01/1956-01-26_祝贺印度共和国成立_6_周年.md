    The great people of India are celebrating their nation's independence day. The Chinese people, who have been freed from centuries of oppression, share a lasting and deep friendship with the Indian people, and deeply understand the joyous feelings of the Indian people on the day they celebrate the restoration of national independence. Like celebrating their own holiday, the Chinese people extend warm congratulations to the Indian people at this glorious moment!
    The establishment of the Republic of India is an event of great significance in the development of modern Asia. India was in a colonial position for many centuries. India's achievement of national sovereignty and national independence shows that the colonial system of Western countries in Asia has come to an end, and it has encouraged the development of the struggle of the oppressed people for national independence. Now, a broad road of independent development has opened up before the Indian people. Their efforts to build their own independent country have been effective and have made India an increasingly important factor in strengthening the cause of international peace.
    In the six years since India's independence, it has made remarkable achievements in domestic construction. India is now on the eve of implementing its second five-year plan. One of the main goals of this plan is to accelerate industrial development. The Indian government and people's emphasis on establishing their own national industry is obviously very correct. This is not only a reliable guarantee for improving the living standards of the Indian people, but also an important foundation for consolidating India's independence. The efforts made by the Indian government and people in economic construction over the years show that they are determined to firmly grasp their own destiny.
    The Indian government and people have made great contributions to consolidating peace and easing international tensions. India is playing an increasingly important role in resolving international issues and establishing friendly relations between countries. It has made indelible contributions to stopping the Korean War, restoring peace in Indochina, initiating and participating in the Asian-African Conference, cooperating with China and other 27 Asian and African countries to establish the Bandung Spirit, and strengthening friendly cooperation among countries. On the Taiwan issue, India adheres to a just position, advocating that Taiwan is part of China's territory. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by the Indian Prime Minister and our Premier have opened up a path for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and helped to ease international tensions. Now, the Five Principles have become principles commonly observed by peace-loving countries. Its influence is still expanding day by day. The mutual visits of the Prime Ministers of China and India have not only strengthened the close friendship between the two peoples, but also greatly helped to consolidate peace in the Far East. The mutual visits of state leaders of the Soviet Union and India have further accelerated the development of world peace and expanded the area of peace. The efforts made by the Indian government and people for Asian and world peace have been widely praised by the people of the world. It is by no means accidental that India's international prestige has grown rapidly in recent years, and India has become one of the world's major countries.
    Facts show that India's commitment to world peace, development of equal and mutually beneficial trade relations, and strengthening of friendly cooperation among countries have brought great benefits to its domestic economic construction. In particular, the strengthening of India's friendly and cooperative relations with the Soviet Union, China, and other peace-loving countries has had an increasingly significant and positive effect on India's economic construction. In 1955, the trade volume between India and our country increased rapidly. India's trade relations with the Soviet Union have seen even greater development. The strengthening of this kind of equal and mutually beneficial trade relations is of great significance for India to successfully implement its construction plans.
    The Chinese and Indian people have always had a deep friendship. Our two great Asian countries have reached the common goal of the two peoples through different paths - their respective national independence. This common pride in achieving national independence has deepened the deep mutual understanding and respect between the two peoples. Now, the people of the two countries are working hand in hand for the common cause of consolidating peace, safeguarding and consolidating national independence. We wish this friendship to grow stronger and more consolidated.

    祝贺印度共和国成立6周年
    伟大的印度人民正在欢庆自己国家的独立节日。摆脱了许多世纪的压迫的中国人民，同印度人民有着持久的深厚友谊，深切地理解印度人民在恢复民族独立的节日里的愉快心情。中国人民像欢庆自己的节日一样，在这光辉的时刻向印度人民致以热烈的祝贺！
    印度共和国的成立，是现代亚洲发展中的一个有重大意义的事件。印度在许多世纪中处在殖民地的地位。印度获得国家主权和民族独立，表明西方国家在亚洲的殖民制度已到末日，它鼓舞了被压迫国家人民争取民族独立斗争的发展。现在，印度人民面前展开了独立发展的广阔道路，他们建设自己独立国家的努力已经取得成效，并使印度日益成为加强国际和平事业的重要因素。
    印度独立6年来，在国内建设方面已经取得显著成绩。现在印度正处在实施第二个五年计划的前夕。这个计划的主要目标之一，是加速工业的发展。印度政府和人民强调建立他们自己民族工业的方针，显然是十分正确的。这不仅是提高印度人民生活水平的可靠保证，而且是巩固印度独立的重要基础。印度政府和人民这些年来在经济建设方面所作的努力，表明他们坚决要把自己的命运紧紧地掌握在自己手里。
    印度政府和人民为巩固和平和缓和国际紧张局势作了伟大的贡献。在解决国际问题和建立各国之间的友好关系方面，印度正在发挥越来越重要的作用。它在停止朝鲜战争，恢复印度支那和平，倡导和参加亚非会议，协同中国和其他27个亚非国家建立万隆精神，加强各国友好合作这些方面，都作了不可磨灭的贡献。在台湾问题上，印度坚持正义的立场，主张台湾是中国领土的一部分。印度总理和我国总理共同倡导的和平共处五项原则，开展了不同社会制度的国家和平共处的道路，有助于和缓国际紧张局势。现在，五项原则已经成为爱好和平国家共同遵守的原则。它的影响还在一天天地扩大。中印两国总理的互相访问不仅是加强了两国人民的亲切友谊，而且大大有助于巩固远东和平。苏印两国国家领导人的互相访问更加加速了世界和平事业的发展，扩大了和平地区。印度政府和人民为亚洲和世界和平所作的努力，已经得到世界人民的普遍赞扬。印度近年来的国际威望迅速增长，印度已经成为世界大国之一，这绝不是偶然的。
    事实说明，印度致力于世界和平，发展平等互利的贸易关系和加强各国之间的友好合作，已经给它在国内的经济建设工作带来了很大的好处。特别是印度同苏联、中国以及其他爱好和平国家友好合作关系的加强，对印度经济建设事业产生了日益显著的良好作用。1955年印度同我国的贸易额有了迅速的增加。印度同苏联的贸易关系更有着重大的发展。这种平等互利的贸易关系的加强，对于印度顺利执行它的建设计划有着很大的意义。
    中国人民和印度人民从来就有深厚的友谊。我们两个伟大的亚洲国家经过不同的道路达到了两国人民的共同目标——各自的国家独立。这种取得国家独立的共同的自豪又加深了两国人民深切的相互了解和尊重。现在，两国人民正在为着巩固和平、维护和巩固民族独立的共同事业携手前进。祝这种友谊日益增强和巩固。
