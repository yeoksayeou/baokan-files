    Not long ago, I went to Wangxian Township in Jiading County, Jiangsu Province, and met Chen Keshi, the director of the Xianfeng First Agricultural Production Cooperative. Talking about Wangxian Township's four-year plan to eliminate schistosomiasis, Chen Keshi said to me: "If you want to understand the situation of Wangxian Township's elimination of schistosomiasis, my family is a typical example."

    Wangxian Township is located in the water network area of the Yangtze River Delta, and has historically been a severely epidemic area of schistosomiasis. Among the more than 3,700 people in the township, more than 1,400 suffered from schistosomiasis. Chen Keshi remembers that when he was nine years old, his father died of schistosomiasis. He left behind his mother and two brothers, relying on renting a few acres of land from the landlord to make a living, and his mother also suffered from schistosomiasis.

    In the year of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chen Keshi began to feel that his body was getting worse day by day. He felt tired after doing little heavy work and often had chills and fever. It turned out that Chen Keshi also suffered from schistosomiasis. The family's crops were grown by him and his elder brother and sister-in-law. Because he could not work well, one mu of rice only yielded 150 to 160 jin of rice. After paying the rent and taxes, sometimes they couldn't even afford porridge. Chen Keshi had to work short-term jobs for others in Wangxian Town with his illness to reduce the burden on his family. When his hometown was liberated in 1949, Chen Keshi felt tired even doing light work. He could only eat a small bowl of rice for each meal, and his face became even more yellow. He could only go out to cut some grass every day to feed the little yellow cow that his family had bought on credit. Soon, his mother also passed away.

    One afternoon in the autumn of 1951, Chen Keshi was cutting grass near Wangxian Town when he heard someone tell him a piece of news: the Communist Party had sent doctors who, together with the doctors of the local joint clinic, specialized in treating schistosomiasis. With the mentality of "treating a dead horse as if it were alive," Chen Keshi went to register the next morning. Later, the doctor gave him injections. After more than 20 injections, Chen Keshi felt that his body was different. He was not so tired when he worked, and he felt more relaxed. By the autumn of the following year, his face had a faint red color, he could eat two large bowls of rice per meal, and he could do heavy work. He was grateful to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He actively participated in any work in the mutual aid group, and everyone elected him as the leader of the mutual aid group.

    However, in those days, Chen Keshi remembered that he and Xiufang had been married for more than two years, but Xiufang had not given birth to a child, and he felt that it was difficult for her to do some odd jobs. Chen Keshi felt very frustrated. One night, Chen Keshi finally brought up the issue of divorce with Xiufang. Later, after his aunt's repeated persuasion, the matter was put aside.

    In the winter of 1952, the government conducted a general survey of schistosomiasis in Wangxian Township. Subsequently, the schistosomiasis prevention and control team sent by the former East China Military and Political Committee's Health Department came to Wangxian Township and set up prevention and control teams in villages with severe schistosomiasis. The Lilong Village where Chen Keshi's family lived also vacated a house as a treatment ward. After examination, Chen Xiufang was found to have schistosomiasis and was admitted to the prevention and control team for treatment. More than a week later, she was transferred to the Wangxian Town prevention and control station for more than ten days of treatment. After returning, her complexion became more and more vigorous, she ate more, and she became stronger. Not only did she do more work in the fields, but she also took care of more housework. The couple got along well. In the past few years, due to their hard work, the harvests in the fields have been very good every year. In 1953, Xiufang went to a civil school to study culture. In the spring of 1954, they both joined the agricultural production cooperative together. Their feelings for each other also got better day by day.

    In the winter of 1954, just as the village's unified purchase and sale of grain was coming to an end, and Chen Keshi was accepted as a probationary member of the Wangxian Township Party Branch, Xiufang gave birth to her first son - Yougen. On that day, the couple was overjoyed, and her aunt, who lived seven or eight miles away, also came to congratulate her. The villagers said to them: "It is not easy to have this child. The Communist Party has put in so much effort!"

    In 1955, the masses elected Chen Keshi as the director of the agricultural production cooperative. The cooperative's grain had a bumper harvest in 1955, with rice yielding 540 jin per mu and wheat yielding 175 jin per mu. The couple worked more than 260 workdays and received more than 2,100 jin of grain and 110 yuan in cash, and the family lived a happy life.

    陈可师夫妇在治好血吸虫病前后
    朱敬禹
    不久以前，我到江苏省嘉定县的望仙乡去，遇到了先锋第一农业生产合作社的社长陈可师。谈起望仙乡在四年内消灭血吸虫病的规划，陈可师对我说：“你要了解望仙乡消灭血吸虫病的情形，我一家就是典型的例子。”
    望仙乡在长江三角洲的水网地带，历来是血吸虫病严重流行的地区。全乡3，700多人中间有1，400多个患着血吸虫病。陈可师记得他九岁那年，爸爸因为患血吸虫病死了。丢下他妈妈和他兄弟两个，靠租种地主的几亩田地过活，并且他妈妈也患了血吸虫病。
    抗日战争胜利那年，陈可师开始觉得自己的身体一天比一天坏，没干多少重活，就觉得疲倦，而且常常发寒发热。原来陈可师也患了血吸虫病。家中庄稼靠他和哥哥嫂嫂几个人种，因为他不能好好劳动，一亩水稻才收一百五、六十斤大米，交了租，纳了税，有时候就连粥也喝不上。陈可师只得带着病，到望仙镇上给人家做些短工，减轻家中对他的负担。1949年家乡解放的时候，陈可师连干轻活也觉得累，每顿只吃一小碗饭，脸也越加黄了。他每天只能出去割些青草，喂饱家里欠债买来的一头小黄牛。不久，他妈妈也去世了。
    在1951年秋天的一个下午，陈可师正在望仙镇附近割草，听到旁人告诉他一个消息：共产党派来了医生，和当地联合诊所的医生一起，专门治血吸虫病。陈可师怀着“死马当作活马医”的心情，第二天清早去挂了一个号。后来，医生就给他打针。打了20多针以后，陈可师感觉到自己的身体不一样了，干起活来没有那么累了，心情也觉得宽畅起来。到第二年秋天，他的脸上泛出了淡红的血色，每顿饭能吃上两大碗，干重活也能行了。他心里感激着共产党和毛主席。他在互助组里什么工作也积极干，大家选他当了互助组长。
    可是，就在那些日子里，陈可师想起他和秀芳结婚两年多了，秀芳却没生一个孩子，而且看她做些零星活也很吃力，陈可师感到很懊恼。一天晚上，陈可师终于向秀芳提出了离婚的问题。后来经过姑母再三劝说，才把这事搁了下来。
    1952年冬天，政府在望仙乡进行了血吸虫病的普查工作。接着，前华东军政委员会卫生部派出的血吸虫病防治工作队来到了望仙乡，并且在血吸虫病严重的村子设立了防治小组。陈可师家所在的里巷村也腾出了一幢房子作为治疗病房。陈秀芳经过检查，发现也患血吸虫病，于是就进了防治组医治。一个多星期以后，又转到望仙镇的防治总站治了十多天。回来以后，人的气色一天比一天旺盛，饭吃得多了，气力也大起来了，不仅田里活做得多，家务事也管得多了。两口子融洽起来了。几年来，由于他们两人努力劳动，田地里的收成年年都很好。1953年，秀芳上了民校学习文化。1954年春上，他俩又一起参加了农业生产合作社。两个人的感情也一天比一天好起来了。
    1954年冬天，正当村上粮食统购统销工作结束、陈可师被望仙乡党支部接受为中共候补党员的时候，秀芳生了第一个男孩子——有根。那一天，夫妻两口子欢天喜地，七、八里外的姑母也赶来道贺。村上的乡亲们对他们说：“生这孩子不简单，共产党操了多少心哪！”
    1955年，群众选举陈可师当了农业生产合作社的社长。社里的粮食在1955年获得丰收，水稻每亩收540斤，小麦每亩收175斤。他们两口子做了260多个劳动日，分到2，100多斤粮食和110元现款，一家人过着幸福生活。
