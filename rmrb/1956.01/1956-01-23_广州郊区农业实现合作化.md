    After the suburbs of Guangzhou completed semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization on the 12th, they completed fully socialist agricultural cooperativization by the 19th. More than 95% of the 37,000+ farm households in the entire suburban area have joined advanced agricultural production cooperatives.
    In the past few days, various districts have held celebrations for the victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture. On the 19th, the Baiyun District, which had already fully realized all-socialist agricultural cooperativization, sent a reporting team of more than 2,000 farmers to the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Guangzhou Municipal People's Committee to report the good news.
