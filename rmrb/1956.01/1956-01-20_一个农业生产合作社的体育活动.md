    Sports Activities in an Agricultural Production Cooperative
    In the Fenghua Agricultural Production Cooperative, Jinzhou Town, Jin County, Liaoning Province, the number of members who regularly participate in sports activities has reached half of the total membership. The cooperative has organized a football team, a basketball team, a long-distance running team, and men's and women's volleyball teams. Many female members also regularly jump rope and play shuttlecock.
    During festivals and slack farming seasons, the cooperative often organizes friendly ball game competitions. On one occasion, young members competed against middle-aged members in football, and even 53-year-old member Cui Peiji participated in the game.
    Sports activities have strengthened the members' physical fitness. Before participating in sports activities, young member Wang Xiude was in poor health. After participating in physical exercise, he was not only able to do heavy work, but also won first place in both the 1,500-meter and 800-meter races at a town-wide sports meet in Jinzhou Town.

    一个农业生产合作社的体育活动
    辽宁省金县金州镇丰华农业生产合作社经常参加体育活动的社员已经达到社员总数的一半。这个社已经组织了一个足球队、一个篮球队、一个长跑队和男、女排球队。很多女社员还经常跳绳和踢毽子。
    每逢节日和农闲时间，这个社经常组织球类友谊比赛。有一次，青年社员和壮年社员比赛足球，连53岁的老社员崔培基也下场参加比赛。
    体育活动增强了社员们的体质。青年社员王修德在没有参加体育活动前，身体很不好，参加体育锻炼以后，不仅能干重活，并且在金州镇的一次全镇体育运动会上，获得了1，500公尺和800公尺两项比赛的第一名。
