　　We Must Fulfill the Five-Year Plan One Year Ahead of Schedule
　　Liu Jiuxue, National People's Congress Representative, National Model Worker in Industry
　　1956 has arrived. In the past three years, our coal mining team has comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan every month. The method we have adopted is to promote advanced experiences. In 1955, despite the high gas content, high underground water levels, and poor roof conditions, we resolutely promoted the advanced experience of regular cyclical operation. Recently, in the labor emulation campaign to strive for the early completion of the first Five-Year Plan, launched in the Jiaozuo Coal Mine, our coal mining team promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet one-shift coal mining system, creating a new record of an average of over nine tons of coal per worker across the entire workface. In 1955, our team extracted 165,478 tons of raw coal, which is 34% more than the output assigned to our team by the state for 1957.
    We are by no means satisfied with this level. We know that the country is carrying out socialist construction in accordance with the grand first Five-Year Plan, and the huge factories and mines being built in various places will increase day by day. Construction, production, and transportation all require large amounts of coal, and the broad masses of urban and rural people also need coal for heating and cooking. In order to accelerate the country's industrialization, at the beginning of November 1955, our entire team guaranteed to complete the first Five-Year Plan half a year ahead of schedule, and proposed to all workers and comrades in Henan Province to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This initiative was quickly supported by brothers from many factories, mines, and construction and installation enterprises in Henan Province. Recently, after our entire team of workers studied Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperation, their enthusiasm for production has been even higher. We have further tapped production potential. Now, we are not guaranteeing to complete it half a year ahead of schedule, but guaranteeing to complete the first Five-Year Plan ten months ahead of schedule, and striving to complete it one year ahead of schedule. A few days ago, when our entire team of employees discussed the 1956 state plan, they decided to overfulfill the state coal mining plan by 37% in 1956 and complete savings tasks worth more than 60,000 yuan.
    In order to guarantee the completion of the first Five-Year Plan ten months to one year ahead of schedule, our entire team of employees has decided to continue to promote the advanced experience of the one-shift coal mining system, in order to consolidate regular cyclical operations, improve the utilization rate of machinery, and strive to achieve an average labor efficiency of over ten tons per worker across the entire workface.
    Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the high tide of agricultural cooperation has arrived, and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has also entered a new stage. Our entire team of employees will join with worker brothers across the country, full of confidence, to accelerate the pace of socialist industrialization and catch up.

### 我们要提前一年完成五年计划

　　我们要提前一年完成五年计划
　　全国人民代表大会代表全国工业劳动模范  刘九学
　　1956年来到了。在过去三年，我们的采煤队，月月全面地超额完成了国家计划。我们所采取的办法，就是推广先进经验。1955年，我们在瓦斯多、地下水多、顶板坏的情况下，仍然坚决地推广了正规循环作业的先进经验。最近，在焦作煤矿开展的争取提前完成第一个五年计划的劳动竞赛中，我们的采煤队又推广了苏联一班采煤制的先进经验，创造了工作面全员劳动效率平均九吨多的新纪录。1955年，我们队采出原煤165，478吨，比国家给我们队规定的1957年的产量还多34％。
    我们绝不满足于这个水平。我们知道国家正在按照宏伟的第一个五年计划进行着社会主义建设，各地兴建的巨大厂矿将一天一天增加。建设、生产、运输都需要大量煤炭，广大城乡人民也需要煤炭来取暖烧饭。为了加速国家的工业化建设，1955年11月初，我们全队保证提前半年完成第一个五年计划，并且向河南省全体职工同志提出提前完成五年计划的倡议。这个倡议很快地就得到了河南省许多工厂、矿山、建筑安装企业的兄弟们的支持。最近，我们全队工人学习了毛主席关于农业合作化的指示以后，生产情绪更加高涨了。我们进一步挖掘了生产潜力。现在，我们不是保证提前半年，而是保证提前十个月，并且争取提前一年完成第一个五年计划。前几天，我们全队职工讨论1956年国家计划的时候，决定1956年超额37％完成国家采煤计划，并且完成价值六万多元的节约任务。
    为了保证提前十个月到一年完成第一个五年计划，我们全队职工决定继续推广一班采煤制的先进经验，以巩固正规循环作业，提高机械利用率，争取工作面全员劳动效率平均达到十吨以上。
    在党中央和毛主席的领导下，农业合作化的高潮已经到来，资本主义工商业的社会主义改造也进入了新的阶段。我们全队职工将跟全国工人兄弟一道，满怀信心地把社会主义工业化的速度加快，迎头赶上去。
