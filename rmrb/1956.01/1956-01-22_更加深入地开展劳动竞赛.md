To the Editor:

We are the workers of Class A of the Medium Plate Workshop of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. The state's First Five-Year Plan requires us to produce a large number of high-quality, low-cost steel plates to support the country's construction. In order to better complete the tasks assigned to us by the state, last year we learned from the Soviet Union's experience in team-based economic accounting and divided the entire class into three groups to organize labor emulation between the groups. Since implementing this method, our class's production performance has greatly improved, achieving high output, good quality, and low material consumption, as well as increased by-products. Therefore, in the second half of 1955, we received the factory's Red Banner of Excellence for four consecutive months. In the labor emulation, the comrades in the shearing team put forward the slogan "Roll as much as you press, cut as much as you roll." In addition to completing the fixed-size tasks according to the shift, they could also cut out the short-size steel plates produced during the shift. Crane operator Li Zhong'an came up with a way to turn the waste contact pieces over and reuse them, saving several kilograms of purple copper plates in a month. Shearing worker Yin Jiuxian not only did his job well but also calculated how much raw material his class had each day and how much finished product should be produced, so that everyone knew what they had, in order to improve the utilization rate of raw materials. In this way, from January to October 1955, we increased the production of steel plates by 2,895 tons for the country, saved a large amount of steel billets, and reduced costs by 125,000 yuan.

The First Five-Year Plan is a major step for the motherland towards socialism. We guarantee to further promote the experience of team-based economic accounting, carry out labor emulation more deeply, and make greater achievements in production to realize this great plan ahead of schedule!

    更加深入地开展劳动竞赛编辑同志：
    我们是鞍山钢铁公司中板厂甲班的工人。国家第一个五年计划要求我们生产大批质量高、成本低的钢板，来支援国家的建设。为了更好地完成国家交给我们的任务，去年我们学习了苏联班组经济核算的经验，并且把全班分成三个小组，组织了小组之间的劳动竞赛。实行这个办法以来，我们班的生产成绩大大提高了，做到了产量多、质量好、用料少，而且多出副产品。因此，1955年下半年，我们连续4个月得到了厂里的优胜红旗。在劳动竞赛中，剪断班的同志们提出了“压延轧多少，剪断剪多少”的口号，除了按班完成定尺任务以外，还能把当班生产的短尺钢板也剪出来。天车工李中安想出了把废接触片翻过来再用的办法，一个月就节省了好几公斤的紫铜板。剪断工人尹九先不但把自己的工作做好，而且每天还计算出自己班里有多少原料，该出多少成品，让大家心中有数，以便提高原料的使用率。这样，从1955年1月到10月，我们为国家增产了钢板2，895吨，节约了大批的钢坯，而且降低成本125，000元。
    第一个五年计划是祖国走向社会主义的一个重大步骤。我们保证要进一步推行班组经济核算的经验，更加深入地开展劳动竞赛，在生产中做出更大的成绩，来提前实现这个伟大的计划！
