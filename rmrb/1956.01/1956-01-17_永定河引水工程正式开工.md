    Yongding River Water Diversion Project Officially Begins
    The Yongding River water diversion project, which the people of Beijing have been looking forward to for many years, officially commenced on the 16th. The nearly 30,000 workers and suburban farmers participating in the construction are in high spirits, proposing to bring the clear water of the Yongding River into the city's rivers and lakes by the "May 1st" Labor Day, as a gift for the "May 1st" holiday.
    The Yongding River water diversion project is large in scale, with nearly 3 million cubic meters of earthwork. The main projects include: building a 17-arch barrage and a two-arch water intake gate; excavating a 700-meter tunnel; excavating a new 20-kilometer channel from Sanjiadian via Shuanghuaishu to Zizhuyuan; and widening and deepening the Nanhan River from Shuanghuaishu to Xibianmen; the Hucheng River in front of Qianmen will also be widened and deepened in stages. After these projects are completed, the diverted river water can be maintained at more than 1.5 million tons per day, which is 4.3 times more than Beijing's existing water sources. This will not only meet the needs of Beijing's industrial and agricultural production and people's lives, but also turn the city's rivers and lakes into flowing living water. At the same time, a small hydropower station can be built using the 28-meter high drop after the channel exits the tunnel. After the completion of this project, the river channel from Sanjiadian to Xibianmen, which is more than 20 kilometers long, about 40 meters wide, and four or five meters deep, will become the initial "Beijing Canal".
    The project was originally planned to be completed in 1958. Now, in order to meet the needs of Beijing's construction in various aspects, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee has decided to basically complete the water diversion project in the first half of this year. The Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Railways have also allocated manpower and machinery to vigorously support this project.

### 永定河引水工程正式开工

    永定河引水工程正式开工
    北京市人民多年盼望修建的永定河引水工程，16日正式开工了。参加施工的近3万工人和郊区农民的情绪都非常高涨，提出争取在“五一”节把清清的永定河水引进市内各河、湖内来，作为“五一”节的献礼。
    永定河引水工程规模很大，全部土方工程就将近有300万立方公尺。其主要工程有：修建一座17孔的拦河闸和一座两孔的进水闸；开凿一条700公尺的隧洞；开挖一条从三家店经双槐树到紫竹院20多公里的新渠道；还要将从双槐树到西便门段的南旱河挖宽、挖深；前三门护城河也要分期挖宽、挖深。这些工程完成以后，引进来的河水，每天可以保持在150万吨以上，比北京市现有水源增加4.3倍。这不仅可以满足北京市工业农业生产和人民生活的需要，还可以使城区河湖变成流动的活水，同时可以利用渠道出隧洞后的28公尺高的跌落建成一座小型水力发电站。这一工程完成以后，从三家店到西便门的20多公里长、40公尺左右宽和四、五公尺深的河道，将成为初期的“北京运河”。
    这个工程原计划在1958年建成，现在为了适应北京各方面建设的需要，北京市人民委员会决定在今年上半年要基本完成引水工程。水利部、建筑工程部、交通部、铁道部等部门也都抽出人力和机械大力支援这个工程。
