Establishing a Normal Working and Living Order

    To the Editor:
    We are staff members of the Xidan District People's Court in Beijing. In the past, our office work was chaotic, and the staff's spare time could not be reasonably guaranteed. Since September 1955, after studying the advanced work experience of the Xuanwu District People's Court in Beijing, the situation has changed significantly. Not only has the efficiency of judicial work greatly improved, but the staff has also been able to work and live normally.
    In the past, our office's work system was unsound, and the work methods were unscientific. For example, we did not well implement the people's assessor system and fully utilize the due role of people's assessors; we did not seriously organize collegial panels to handle cases, but mainly used the method of judges and clerks working separately, resulting in very low case-handling efficiency; we did not implement formal litigation procedures, and the quality of case closure was also not high. At that time, we often worked overtime to clear backlog cases, and we often did not get rest on Sundays. Even so, each person could only close about 25 cases per month. The old cases were not cleared, and new cases piled up. In this situation, the staff not only could not get the due rest, recreation, and family life time, affecting physical health and life order, but also had no time for theoretical and professional study, which prevented the improvement of work standards. However, at that time, everyone felt that the only way to change this situation was to increase staffing, without considering how to improve work methods.
    After learning from the advanced work experience of the Xuanwu District People's Court, we criticized the conservatism in our work and greatly improved our work methods. We formulated detailed work plans and adopted the method of centralized investigation and batch hearings when there were many cases; we fully utilized the role of each member of the collegial panel to achieve a reasonable division of labor and prevent the phenomenon of repeated use of resources in the work; we fully prepared for the hearing before the trial, so that we could raise questions in a planned way during the hearing and guide the parties to speak around the central issue, so that general cases could be concluded in one hearing, and judgments could be written on the spot. In addition, some improvements have also been made in case acceptance work, meeting system, and other aspects.
    As a result, a new atmosphere has emerged in our office. Each of our collegial panels can close more than 50 cases per month. On the basis of improving the quality of case handling, the efficiency of case handling has doubled. The phenomenon of overtime work has disappeared, and staff can freely dispose of their spare time for theoretical and policy study, recreational activities, or household chores.

### 我们的工作不再忙乱不堪了

专栏：建立正常的工作和生活秩序

    我们的工作不再忙乱不堪了编辑同志：
    我们是北京市西单区人民法院的工作人员。过去，我们机关里工作忙乱，工作人员的业余时间不能得到合理的保证；自从1955年9月学习了北京市宣武区人民法院先进的工作经验以后，情况就有了显著的变化；不但审判工作的效率大大提高了，而且工作人员也能够正常地工作和生活。
    过去，我们机关的工作制度不健全，工作方法不科学。例如，我们没有很好执行人民陪审员制度，充分发挥人民陪审员应有的作用；我们没有认真组织合议庭来办案，而主要用审判员和书记员分头单干的办法，办案效率很低；我们没有实行正规的诉讼程序，结案质量也不高。那时候，我们经常加班加点来清理积案，星期日也常常得不到休息。虽然这样，每人每月只能结案25件左右，旧的案件没有清理完，新的案件又积压下来了。在这种情况下，工作人员不但不能得到应有的休息、文娱和家庭生活的时间，影响了身体健康和生活秩序，而且也没有时间进行理论和业务学习，使工作水平不能提高。但是当时，大家都觉得要改变这种状况只有增加编制，而没有考虑如何改进工作方法的问题。
    学习了宣武区人民法院先进的工作经验以后，我们批判了工作中的保守主义思想，大大地改进了工作方法。我们制定了周密的工作计划，在案件较多的时候采用集中调查，成批开庭的办法；我们充分发挥了合议庭每个成员的作用，做到合理分工，防止工作中重复使用力量的现象；我们充分做好开庭审理以前的准备工作，开庭的时候就能够有计划地提出问题，引导当事人围绕着中心问题发言，因此一般案件都可以做到一庭结案，并且当场就写出判决书。此外，在收案工作、会议制度等方面，也做了一些改进。
    由于这样，我们机关出现了新的气象。我们每个合议庭每月能够结案50件以上，在提高了办案质量的基础上，办案效率提高了一倍。加班加点的现象已经没有了，工作人员都可以自由地支配自己的业余时间，进行理论、政策等学习和文娱活动或者料理家务。
