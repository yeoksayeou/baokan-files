Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 10th:

    A socialist agricultural cooperation upsurge has appeared in Liaoning Province, with more than half of the province's farmers participating in advanced agricultural production cooperatives. As of early January, more than four thousand advanced cooperatives have been established throughout the province. These cooperatives are generally large in scale, averaging around 300 households per cooperative, with some having around 2,000 households. Some areas, such as Heishan, Fuxian, and Kangping counties, have completely realized the complete socialist agricultural cooperation.
    Currently, many lower-level cooperatives in Liaoning Province are requesting to be converted into advanced cooperatives. Based on the development of the agricultural cooperation movement throughout the province, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed that in the future, while consolidating existing cooperatives and helping them to do a good job in production planning, lower-level cooperatives should be gradually converted into advanced cooperatives in a guided and prepared manner. It is expected that by the end of this year, Liaoning Province can basically realize the complete socialist agricultural cooperation. (Attached picture)

    辽宁出现社会主义农业合作化高潮
    全省半数以上的农户参加高级社
    据新华社沈阳10日电  辽宁全省已经有一半以上的农户参加了高级阶段的农业生产合作社。截至1月上旬，全省已经建成了四千多个高级社。这些社规模一般都比较大，平均每社三百户左右，有些社有两千户左右。有些地区如黑山、复县、康平等县，已经全部实现了完全社会主义的农业合作化。
    目前，辽宁省仍有很多低级社要求转为高级社。中共辽宁省委员会根据全省农业合作化运动发展的情况，提出今后要在巩固现有社和帮助现有社搞好生产规划等工作中，有领导有准备地把低级社逐步转为高级社。预计到今年年底，辽宁全省就可以基本上实现完全社会主义的农业合作化。（附图片）
