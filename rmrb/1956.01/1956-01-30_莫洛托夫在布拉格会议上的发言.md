Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 28th:

    Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives: The Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed last May in Warsaw by our countries stipulates that the contracting parties shall consult with each other on all important international issues concerning their common interests. The convocation of this meeting of the Political Consultative Committee is precisely for this purpose, and also to study certain other issues and measures arising from the implementation of the treaty.

    Despite the opposition of imperialist aggressor forces and their policy of piecing together military blocs, all member states of our Warsaw Treaty have made considerable efforts in the interests of peace and security to strive for easing international tensions and strengthening trust between countries.

    The People's Republic of China plays a huge role in easing international tensions, and its international prestige is growing daily. At the same time, the fact that the great Chinese people are resolutely embarking on the road of socialist transformation is also of decisive significance. Other countries, especially major Asian countries such as India, have also made considerable contributions to the development of peaceful cooperation.

    The Four-Power Summit Conference held in Geneva last July proved that cooperation between countries with different social systems is a practical matter if such cooperation is based on mutual respect for each other's interests and leads to the consolidation of peace. The "Geneva spirit" has been supported by the broad masses of people in all countries.

    However, comrades, we must recognize that we should not relax our vigilance because of the victory of the forces of peace and some easing of international tensions. We cannot assume that the threat of a new war has disappeared. We must not forget that the imperialist aggressor blocs still harbor adventurous attempts, and their fear of the recent easing of international tensions and international cooperation has increased.

    As everyone knows, as early as the end of 1954, the North Atlantic Group Council advocated preparing for atomic warfare. It doesn't stop there. Last December, the North Atlantic Group also advocated arming the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's troops with atomic weapons, increasing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's air force stationed in Western Europe by one-third, and accelerating the remilitarization of West Germany. It is worth noting here that some Americans are particularly impatient to realize the remilitarization of West Germany.

    The danger posed by aggressive military blocs and the revival of German militarism prompts us to discuss the common measures arising from the Warsaw Treaty, aimed at broadly and jointly strengthening the defense capabilities of the Warsaw Treaty member states, in order to safeguard international peace and security.

    The starting point for our formulation of these measures remains: the best way to ensure the security of European countries is to establish a collective security system in which all European countries, regardless of differences in social systems and national systems, participate. The issue of ensuring European security is the most pressing and vital issue for the people of European countries.

    The ruling groups of Western countries have rejected the Soviet Union's proposals on European security, and want to include not only West Germany but also East Germany in their military bloc. Needless to say, these plans are impossible to realize because they are not at all for European security, and not at all for unifying Germany into a peaceful and democratic country. Now is the time to understand the obvious fact that two German states exist. The unification of Germany can only be achieved through an agreement between these two Germanies, and there is no other way. The proposal of the Government of the German Democratic Republic to establish an all-German committee is in line with this goal and is fully supported by the Soviet Government.

    The German Democratic Republic and the democratic forces of the entire Germany are the bulwark of peace, democracy and progress in Germany. Strengthening the German Democratic Republic and defending it against possible aggression is in the interests of the German people and in the interests of all peace-loving people in Europe. Now that the West German army has been established and West Germany has been dragged into an aggressive bloc, the German Democratic Republic will naturally take new measures to ensure its own security.

    It is precisely because of this that the German Democratic Republic recently decided to establish a National People's Army. We all fully agree that this decision is necessary.

    The Soviet Union, like all countries committed to maintaining and strengthening peace, is tirelessly fighting for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. We have always adhered to Lenin's principle of peaceful coexistence among all countries. The people understand that the governments of our countries will not lead them to the brink of the abyss, and will not rashly expose their countries to the danger of war. We believe that our task is to promote the consolidation of peace and the easing of international tensions, and to care for the establishment of collective security for the people of Europe and the world.

    The people of our countries believe in their own strength, are encouraged by the great victories in socialist construction, and will not be intimidated by others. Relying on the irresistible desire of the people of the world for peace, relying on their united and ever-growing strength and solidarity, they are confidently implementing a policy of peaceful creation.

    A vivid example of this is the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan. This plan shows that the material and spiritual strength of the Soviet people will grow unprecedentedly. The national economic plans of other countries that are building a new society also illustrate this point. The implementation of these plans will undoubtedly be a new and powerful factor in the struggle to strengthen world peace.

    At the same time, the people of our countries also understand that maintaining defense capabilities at a corresponding level, and being prepared to fully armed to meet and repel any attempts by aggressive forces to undermine their peaceful labor, is one of the most important and effective guarantees for maintaining and strengthening peace.

    Our concerted efforts in defending the cause of peace and developing international cooperation will promote the further strengthening of the world's peace forces. At the same time, this will also help create the best conditions for realizing our peaceful economic and cultural construction plans, which bring happiness and prosperity to the people of our countries and strengthen the security of all countries in the world.

### 莫洛托夫在布拉格会议上的发言

    莫洛托夫在布拉格会议上的发言
    主席同志，各位代表同志：我们这些国家去年5月在华沙签订的友好合作互助条约规定缔约国之间就有关它们共同利益的所有重要国际问题进行协商。政治协商委员会这次会议的召开，正是为了这个目的，还为了研究由于条约的实施而产生的某些其他问题和措施。
    尽管有着帝国主义侵略势力的反对和它们所采取的拼凑军事集团的政策。我们华沙条约所有缔约国本着和平和安全的利益做了不少的努力，来争取缓和国际局势和加强国与国之间的信任。
    中华人民共和国在缓和国际紧张局势方面起着巨大的作用，它的国际威信日益增长。同时，伟大的中国人民坚决地走上社会主义改造的道路这一事实也有着决定意义。其他国家，特别是像印度这样的亚洲大国在发展和平合作方面也做了不少的贡献。
    去年7月在日内瓦举行的四国政府首脑会议证明，不同社会制度的国家之间的合作是一件切实可行的事情，如果这种合作是以相互尊重对方利益为基础并且导致巩固和平的话。“日内瓦精神”在各国广大人民中得到了支持。
    然而，同志们，我们必须认识到，我们不应因为和平力量的胜利和国际紧张局势的某些缓和而放松警惕。不能够认为新战争的威胁已经消逝。不应该忘记帝国主义侵略集团还怀着冒险企图，他们最近对国际紧张局势的缓和和国际合作的恐惧是增长了。
    大家知道，还在1954年底北大西洋集团理事会就主张准备原子战争。事情还不止于此。去年12月北大西洋集团还主张用原子武器武装北大西洋公约组织的军队，主张把北大西洋公约组织驻西欧的空军增加三分之一，主张使西德加速重新军国主义化。这里值得注意的是，某些美国人士对实现西德的重新军国主义化表现得特别的急不可耐。
    侵略性的军事集团和复活德国军国主义所带来的危险，促使我们为了维护国际和平和安全来讨论华沙条约所产生的、旨在广泛地合力加强华沙条约缔约国的防御能力的共同措施的问题。
    我们拟定这些措施的出发点仍然是：保障欧洲国家安全最好的方法是建立集体安全体系，欧洲一切国家不分社会制度和国家制度的不同都参加到这个体系中来。保障欧洲安全的问题是欧洲各国人民最迫切和最切身的问题。
    西方国家的统治集团拒绝了苏联关于欧洲安全的建议，不仅想把西德，而且想把东德也包括到自己的军事集团中去。不用说，这些计划是不可能实现的，因为它们完全不是为了欧洲安全，完全不是为了要把德国统一成为一个和平民主的国家。现在该是了解在德国存在着两个国家这样一个明显的事实的时候了。德国的统一只能由这两个德国的协议来达成，别无其他办法。德意志民主共和国政府关于建立全德委员会的建议符合这个目标，并且受到苏联政府的充分支持。
    德意志民主共和国和整个德国的民主力量是德国的和平、民主和进步的堡垒。加强德意志民主共和国，保卫它免遭可能的侵略，这既符合德国人民的利益，也符合欧洲一切爱好和平的人民的利益。既然西德军队已经建立，西德已经被拖入了侵略集团，德意志民主共和国自然要采取新的措施来保障自己的安全。
    正是由于这一点，德意志民主共和国不久前决定建立国家人民军。我们大家都完全一致地认为这一决定是必要的。
    苏联正如一切致力于维护和加强和平的国家一样，不倦地在为裁减军备和禁止原子武器进行斗争。我们一贯坚持主张一切国家和平共处的列宁主义的原则。人民了解，我们各国的政府不会把他们引到深渊的边缘，不会轻率地使自己的国家遭受战争危险。我们认为我们的任务是，促进和平的巩固和国际紧张局势的缓和，关心建立欧洲和全世界人民的集体安全。
    我们各国的人民相信自己的力量，受到在社会主义建设中的伟大胜利的鼓舞，他们不会被别人吓住的。他们依靠着世界各国人民对和平的不可抑制的愿望，依靠着自己已经联合起来并在不断增长的实力和团结，满怀信心地实行着和平创造性的政策。
    这一点的鲜明例证就是苏联的第六个五年计划。这个计划表明，苏联人民的物质和精神力量会得到空前的增长。其他正在建设新社会的国家的国民经济计划也说明了这一点。这些计划的实现，无疑将是加强世界和平的斗争中的新的强大因素。
    同时，我们各国的人民也懂得，把防御能力保持在相应的水平上，准备着全副武装地迎击和打退侵略势力想破坏他们的和平劳动的任何企图，这是维护和加强和平的最重要和最有效的保证之一。
    我们在保卫和平事业和发展国际合作的斗争中的一致努力，将促进世界和平力量的进一步加强。同时，这也将有助于为实现我们的和平的经济和文化建设计划创造最良好的条件，这些计划在给我们各国人民带来幸福和繁荣，加强世界各国人民的安全。
