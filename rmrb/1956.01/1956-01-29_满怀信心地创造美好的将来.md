    Creating a Bright Future with Full Confidence
    To the Editor:
    We, the more than 1,900 farming families in the Xishan Township of Beijing's suburbs, saw the beautiful vision of our happy life in the 1956-1967 National Agricultural Development Program (Draft). Inspired by this program, we are creating a bright and happy future with full confidence.
    At the end of 1955, encouraged by Chairman Mao's report on the question of agricultural cooperation, the three lower-level agricultural cooperatives in our township merged to form the Xishan Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative. The cooperative has more than 19,000 people, but only over 17,000 mu of land, including hillside land, waterlogged land, and some dry land without irrigation equipment. However, under the leadership of the Party, we are confident to overcome these difficulties. We are now carrying out preliminary planning, and according to the characteristics of our urban suburbs, we will vigorously develop animal husbandry, orchards, and vegetables. We now have two pig farms with more than 400 pigs, and we are using Yorkshire and Berkshire pigs to improve the breed. In the future, we will also develop Ukrainian white pigs. We are now planning to build livestock sheds and accept the request of scattered dairy cow farmers in Xisi District of Beijing to join the cooperative. We plan to develop to 400 dairy cows and 120 dairy goats in 1956. We have decided to plant alfalfa to solve the feed problem. We will plant sweet potatoes and develop orchards on the hillside land, and plant Baima Ya corn in the low-lying areas. In the plains, in addition to planting field crops such as wheat and beans, we plan to plant 1,000 mu of vegetables this year. In terms of water conservancy, we will dig two electric pumping wells this year, plus the original three, which can irrigate 1,500 mu of land; in the next few years, all farmland will have irrigation equipment.
    While marching towards production, we are also marching towards culture. The literacy campaign is underway throughout the township, with more than 700 people participating in the people's schools. There are now 5 primary schools and 1 middle school in the township. In the next few years, we will ensure that there are no illiterate young and middle-aged people in the township.
    The promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) has given us a long-term goal to strive for in our hearts. We are determined to better plan production and make our cooperative achieve excellent results in realizing the requirements of the program.
    Wang Tang, Deputy Director of the Xishan Agricultural Production Cooperative, Beijing

    满怀信心地创造美好的将来编辑同志：
    我们北京郊区西山乡1，900多户农民从1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）中看到我们幸福生活的美丽远景。在这个纲要的鼓舞下，我们满怀信心地创造着美好幸福的将来。
    1955年底我们在毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告的鼓舞下，全乡3个低级农业社合并成立了西山高级农业生产合作社。全社有19，000多人，但是土地只有17，000多亩，其中还有山坡地、涝洼地和一些没有灌溉设备的旱田。但是，在党的领导下，我们有信心克服这些困难。现在我们正在进行初步的规划，按照我们城市郊区的特点，将大力发展养畜业、果园和蔬菜。现在我们已经有养猪场2所，养猪400多头，并且用约克夏和巴克夏猪改良猪种，将来还要发展乌克兰白猪。现在我们正计划修建畜舍，接受北京市西四区零星奶牛饲养户入社的请求，计划在1956年将发展到400头奶牛和120只奶羊。我们决定要种植苜蓿来解决饲料问题。我们将在山坡地种植甘薯和发展果园，在洼地种植白马牙玉米。在平原，除了种植麦豆等大田作物以外，今年计划种植1，000亩菜蔬。在水利方面，我们今年要开凿两眼电机抽水井，加上原有的3眼，可以灌溉1，500亩田地；在今后几年里，将使全部农田都有灌溉设备。
    在向生产进军的同时，我们也正在向文化进军。全乡的扫盲运动正在开展，参加民校的有700多人。全乡现在有5所小学和1所中学。在最近几年以内，我们将作到全乡没有不识字的青壮年。
    全国农业发展纲要（草案）的公布，更使我们心里有了长期奋斗的目标。我们决心更好地规划生产，使我们社在实现纲要提出的要求中作出优良的成绩。
  北京市西山农业生产合作社副主任　王堂
