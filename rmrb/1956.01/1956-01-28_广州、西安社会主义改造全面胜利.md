    Guangzhou and Xi'an Achieve Complete Victory in Socialist Transformation
    (Our newspaper, Guangzhou, January 26th) After Guangzhou fully implemented public-private joint ownership in private industry and commerce, and realized complete socialist collectivization in suburban agriculture, by the 24th, all 100,000 of the city's handicraftsmen had embarked on the road of collectivization; on the 25th, all 4,100 private boats also joined cooperative organizations. Thus, Guangzhou has begun to enter socialist society.
    In the past few days, the upsurge of socialist transformation in Guangdong Province has also gradually expanded. The cities of Shantou, Zhanjiang, Shaoguan, Haikou, Foshan, Jiangmen, Shiqi, and Chaozhou have all implemented public-private joint ownership in private industry and commerce, and handicrafts have all been collectivized. Small merchants and peddlers in various counties are also actively organizing cooperative stores or cooperative groups.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 26th) More than 90% of the primary agricultural producers' cooperatives in the suburbs of Xi'an have now been transformed into advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the farmers participating in advanced cooperatives account for more than 95% of the total number of farm households. Prior to this, Xi'an's capitalist industry and commerce had all implemented public-private joint ownership. All of the city's handicrafts have also been collectivized. Thus, Xi'an has entered socialist society.
    At present, most of the newly established handicrafts production cooperatives and groups have established organizational structures and will soon begin production according to production plans. The city's 62 commercial industries and 5 service industries that have implemented public-private joint ownership completed the work of inventorying assets on the 25th, more than half a month ahead of schedule, and ensured normal business operations.
