Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, hosted a banquet on the evening of the 26th to welcome the French economic delegation to China headed by Henri Rochereau.

    In his speech at the banquet, Nan Hanchen said: China and France have a long history of trade relations, but the "embargo" has hindered the development of Sino-French trade. China is a large country and is currently engaged in large-scale economic construction, which requires trade relations with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. France is an industrialized country, and there is a broad prospect for trade between China and France. I believe that this visit by the delegation will help normalize Sino-French trade relations.
    Henri Rochereau spoke, expressing his willingness to work to restore and strengthen trade and friendship between China and France.

    南汉宸设宴欢迎法国访华经济代表团
    据新华社27日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸26日晚设宴欢迎以亨利·罗谢罗为首的法国访华经济代表团。
    南汉宸在宴会上致辞说：中法两国有悠久的贸易关系，但“禁运”已妨碍了中法贸易的开展。中国是一个大国，目前正在进行规模巨大的经济建设，需要在平等互利的原则下开展和各国的贸易关系。法国是一个工业国，中法两国贸易是有广阔前途的，相信代表团此行会有助于中法贸易关系的正常化。
    亨利·罗谢罗发言，表示愿为恢复和加强中法之间的贸易和友谊而努力。
