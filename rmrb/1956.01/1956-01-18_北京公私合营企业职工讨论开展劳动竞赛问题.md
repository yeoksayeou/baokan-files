Xinhua News Agency, January 16th: The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions convened a conference today of trade union cadres and activists from newly joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises to discuss how to rapidly launch labor emulation drives and improve production and business operations after the implementation of joint state-private ownership.

Peng Siming, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, said at the meeting: Doing a good job in production and business operations is the central task of trade union work in joint state-private enterprises at present. In the future, the primary task of trade union work is to promptly channel the enthusiasm of the working masses celebrating joint state-private ownership into practical actions to improve production and business operations, and to organize workers to launch labor emulation drives. He said that the content of the competition in industrial enterprises is to improve product quality, save raw materials, reduce costs, improve business management, and ensure the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the 1956 national plan. The content of the competition in commercial enterprises is mainly to improve service attitude, reduce errors, reduce commodity losses, reduce commodity circulation costs, improve business management, increase commodity varieties, and ensure the fulfillment of the 1956 national sales plan. The trade union should urge and assist the administration in formulating production and sales plans, mobilize workers to discuss and formulate group covenants, with the covenant as a guarantee for carrying out the competition. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the unity within the working class and actively assist the government in doing a good job in economic restructuring. Thirdly, mobilize workers and shop assistants to unite, educate, and transform capitalists under the leadership of the Party. Worker representatives from the ironworking, weaving, department store and other industrial and commercial sectors enthusiastically responded to this call on the spot and put forward specific guarantees.

    北京公私合营企业职工讨论开展劳动竞赛问题
    据新华社16日讯　北京市工会联合会今天召开了最近实行公私合营的工、商企业工会干部和积极分子大会，讨论如何在公私合营后迅速开展劳动竞赛，提高生产、搞好营业的问题。
    北京市工会联合会副主席彭思明在会上说：搞好生产、营业是当前公私合营企业工会工作的中心任务。今后工会工作首先是及时地把职工群众庆祝公私合营的热情引导到提高生产和搞好营业的实际行动中去，组织职工开展劳动竞赛。他说，工业企业竞赛的内容是提高产品质量，节约原材料，降低成本，改善企业经营管理，保证完成和超额完成1956年国家计划。商业企业竞赛的内容，主要是改善服务态度，减少差错，减少商品损耗，降低商品流转费用，改善企业经营管理，增加商品品种，保证完成1956年国家销售计划。工会应该督促和协助行政制定生产、销货计划，发动职工讨论，制定小组公约，以公约为开展竞赛的保证条件。其次，要加强工人阶级内部的团结，积极协助政府做好经济改组工作。第三，发动工人、店员在党的领导下做好团结、教育、改造资本家的工作。铁工、织布、百货等工商行业的职工代表当场热烈响应这一号召，并且纷纷提出具体保证。
