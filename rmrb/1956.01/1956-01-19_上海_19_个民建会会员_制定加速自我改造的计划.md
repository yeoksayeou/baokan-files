Nineteen members of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) in Shanghai, including Tang Di'yin, deputy manager of the Shanghai Pen Manufacturing Industry Company, have each formulated personal reform plans for this year. They also proposed that CDNCA members in industrial and commercial circles should all formulate plans to accelerate self-reform during the high tide of socialist transformation.

Tang Di'yin, deputy manager of the Shanghai Pen Manufacturing Industry Company, included in his plan the task of promoting the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises. He intends to use his own experiences and insights to speak from the heart and play an active role in completing the city's socialist transformation. Zhou Zibai, manager of the joint state-private Jin Xing Gold Pen Factory, plans to assist brother industries when they implement joint state-private ownership. Ning Si'hong, director of the joint state-private Guan Le Ming Gold Pen Factory, plans to actively assist private individuals who have merged into the Guan Le Ming factory, communicate ideas with each other, and do a good job in uniting them. Guo Zhiming, a mechanical engineer and deputy manager of the Shanghai Pen Manufacturing Industry Company, plans to basically achieve the mechanization and automation of nib and barrel manufacturing equipment in the third quarter of 1956.

The personal transformation plans they formulated also include various aspects of personal work, study, ideology, work style, and family life. Some set the goal of "finishing reading the textbook of Political Economy and the Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) within one year," while others set the goal of "arriving at the factory on time every morning according to the enterprise's working hours." They pledged to supervise each other to ensure that every item is implemented and everyone executes it. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
