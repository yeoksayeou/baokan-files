Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 2nd. The newly built Lancun-Yantai Railway in the Shandong Peninsula opened to traffic on the 1st. On the morning of that day, opening ceremonies were held at the Yantai Station and the Qingdao Station, and trains departed from both stations.

　　As the trains passed through various stations, construction workers and local people gathered at the stations to hold welcoming rallies.

　　The Lancun-Yantai Railway connects Lancun on the Jiaoji Railway with the important port of Yantai on the Shandong Peninsula. Construction of this railway officially began in September 1953, and the track laying was completed in early December 1955. With the help of the people along the route, the workers in charge of railway construction completed the track laying project eight days ahead of schedule and overfulfilled the plan to reduce project costs.

　　The completion of the Lancun-Yantai Railway will enable the large quantities of agricultural products such as grain and peanuts, as well as the famous Laiyang pears, Yantai apples, and Yantai aquatic products produced along the route to be quickly transported to all parts of the country, and will also allow the industrial products needed by the farmers along the route to be delivered to the countryside in a timely manner.
