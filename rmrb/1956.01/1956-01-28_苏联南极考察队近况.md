Xinhua News Agency, 27th: TASS special correspondent Denisov reports: The Soviet Antarctic Expedition's diesel-electric ship "Lena" has reached the Antarctic coast, marking the end of the first phase of the expedition.

    In the cloudy Antarctic region, the "Lena," powered by 8,200 horsepower, stubbornly pushed forward through the ice for 70 miles with its heavy steel hull. The navigation conditions became increasingly complex. On January 19th, 780 icebergs were sighted from the "Lena" in a single day and night; the icebergs were almost connected in a string. However, after a journey of over 20,000 kilometers for more than a month, the ship finally met the "Ob" on January 20th.

    The long-awaited Antarctic was before our eyes. A vast coastline covered by continental ice unfolded before us. At a glance, it was a field of white snow glittering in the sunlight. Some black rock formations appeared in this snowfield. In the distance, we could see airplanes and helicopters parked on the snowy airfield, as well as tractors and tracked jeeps in operation.

    Nearby were a group of islands, with thousands of penguins on the largest, Haswell Island. Countless petrels and other Antarctic birds nested on the protruding cliffs. Seals lay motionless on the snow. The expedition declared these islands a hunting-free zone. Mosses and lichens, which are rare in Antarctica, grow on these islands, and they have great scientific research value.

    To the east of the ship's berth was a wide expanse of ice-free water, surrounded by icebergs. The site of the "Peace" observation station was surrounded by an endless ice sheet of continental ice, covered with a layer of loose snow that the sunlight could not penetrate.

    A new and important phase of the Soviet Antarctic Expedition has begun. All personnel are now focusing on quickly moving equipment from the ships to the base construction area. This equipment is being unloaded onto the ice tongue connected to the glacier, which plunges steeply down the 20-meter-high bank. The ice tongue on the shore is being damaged by strong winds and exposure to the sun, and the bright Antarctic sunlight makes hands and faces burn. On January 22nd, the expedition team built new ice roads. Dangerous cracks are lurking in every step on the ice. Despite the great difficulties, the equipment and materials unloaded at the base are increasing every moment. Spacious fuel depots are being quickly built next to the airport, with the fuel stored in metal drums.

    Surveyors are working in various parts of this future scientific city, and hydrological depths are being measured in the bay area. Interesting materials about the huge Shackleton Ice Shelf, which has an area of nearly 40,000 square kilometers, were obtained through long-range aerial reconnaissance. The Soviet science base is to be located precisely between this ice shelf and the West Ice Shelf, which has an area of 30,000 square kilometers. Reconnaissance flights were also conducted along Queen Mary Land, the Groethe Gauss region, and other places. The airmen of the Soviet hero Ivan Cherevichny demonstrated outstanding flying skills under unfamiliar natural conditions.

    苏联南极考察队近况
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社特派记者杰尼索夫报道：苏联南极考察队的“勒拿号”柴油电动船已经到达南极海岸，考察工作的第一阶段结束了。
    在浓云密布的南极附近地区，“勒拿号”曾经开动8，200匹马力，用沉重的钢的船身打破冰层顽强地前进了70多英里。一路上航行条件愈来愈复杂。在1月19日这一昼夜中，从“勒拿号”船上就看到了780座冰山；冰山一个接一个，几乎联成一串。但是，经过一个多月两万公里的航程以后，这艘船终于在1月20日和“鄂毕号”会合了。
    望眼欲穿的南极就呈现在眼前。我们面前展开了辽阔的、被大陆冰所复盖的海岸。一眼望去，是一片在太阳光下闪耀的白皑皑的雪野。在这一片雪地中有些地方出现了一些黑色的岩层。老远可以看到停在雪地飞机场上的飞机和直升飞机，正在开动的拖拉机和有链轨的吉普车。
    附近是一群岛屿，在最大的哈斯威尔岛上有几千只企鹅。在凸出的悬崖上栖息着许许多多的海燕和其他的南极鸟类。海豹一动不动地躺在雪地上。考察队宣布这个群岛为禁猎区。在这些岛上长着在南极很少见的藓苔和地衣，这有很大的科学研究价值。
    从轮船停泊处向东是一片宽阔的没有冰的海水，它的四周环抱着冰山。“和平”观测站的地点四周是一片无边无际的大陆冰的冰原，冰上复盖着一层阳光透不过的松松的雪。
    苏联南极考察队的一个新的重要阶段已经开始了。全体工作人员现在都集中力量把装备从船上迅速搬到基地建设地区。这些装备就卸在和冰河相连接的冰舌上，冰河在高达20公尺的岸边急转直下。岸上的冰舌受到强烈的风吹日晒已在毁坏，南极明朗的阳光晒得手和脸都发烫。1月22日，考察队的全体人员建筑了新的冰道。在冰上每一步都埋伏着危险的裂缝。虽然有很大的困难，在基地上卸下的器材物资每时每刻都在增多起来。在飞机场旁边迅速地建立起宽敞的燃料仓库，燃料都用金属筒装着。
    在这个未来的科学城的各个部分都有测量学家在工作，在海湾部分正在测量水文深度。由于进行了空中的远距离侦察，获得了关于巨大的歇克尔顿冰洲的有趣的材料，它的面积几乎有4万平方公里，苏联科学基地正好就要设在这个冰洲和面积为3万平方公里的西冰洲之间。沿着玛丽皇后地、格罗埃·加乌斯地区和其他地方也进行了侦察飞行。苏联英雄伊凡·契列维奇尼的飞行队员们在毫不熟悉的自然条件下表现了卓越的飞行技巧。
