Ministry of Coal Industry Organizes Work Groups
    Down Mines to Help Summarize Experiences and Formulate Plans
    In order to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the Ministry of Coal Industry organized a work group in late December last year, led by Minister Chen Yu, to go to the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau to convene meetings with Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Mine, Fengfeng No. 4 Mine, Huainan Datong Mine, and Zibo Hongshan Mine to summarize and exchange advanced experiences, and to carry out comprehensive planning for each mine. The meeting summarized and exchanged more than 20 advanced experiences.
    The work group of the Ministry of Coal Industry has recently arrived in the Northeast region and is preparing to convene meetings with some coal mining units there to summarize and exchange advanced experiences and formulate comprehensive plans for each mine.

    煤炭工业部组织工作组
    下矿帮助总结经验制定规划
    煤炭工业部为了提早完成第一个五年计划，在去年12月下旬组织了一个工作组，由陈郁部长率领，前往焦作矿务局召集开滦唐家庄矿、峰峰四矿、淮南大通矿、淄博洪山矿等单位举行了总结和交流先进经验会议，并且进行了各矿的全面规划工作。这次会议共总结和交流了20多项先进经验。
    煤炭工业部的工作组最近已经到了东北地区，准备在那里再召集一些煤矿单位开会，总结和交流先进经验，制定各矿的全面规划。
