    Breaking Free from the Routine of "A Few Percent"
    Jin Wu
    The arrival of the high tide of the agricultural cooperative movement will rapidly change all aspects of the countryside. However, some leading comrades in state-owned commercial departments have not seen this change. They believe that the rural purchasing power will be concentrated on means of production, and the sales of daily industrial products will not be greatly affected. They believe that the sales volume of daily industrial products has increased by a few percent each year in the past, and will not exceed "a few percent" this year either.
    However, the facts are not like this. Taking Jiangsu Province as an example: In the fourth quarter of last year, the province's sales of cotton cloth increased by 71% compared with the same period in 1954, sugar increased by 145%, rubber shoes increased by 44%, and bicycles increased by 499%. In the face of such huge changes, if we formulate production and sales plans according to the routine of "a few percent," the consequences will be unimaginable.
    New situations are still developing daily. For example, some provinces are preparing to set up telephones in various townships, some counties are installing wired broadcasting networks, and some cooperatives have purchased or plan to purchase goods such as radios and sewing machines. These cannot be estimated by sitting in the office and using the numbers of "a few percent."
    To make the plans realistic, we must break free from the routine of "a few percent," seriously study the development of the situation, fully estimate the changes in the market, and understand the needs of the masses. After formulating realistic plans, we must also make every effort to organize a variety of goods of excellent quality, suitable prices, needed and loved by the peasants, and continuously supply them to the countryside to ensure the realization of this plan. And to achieve such requirements, the key lies in: thoroughly overcoming the serious conservative thinking in our work and changing the current situation where our thinking lags behind the development of the situation.

    从“百分之几”的常规里跳出来
    靳吾
    农业合作化运动高潮的到来，将迅速地改变农村各方面的面貌。但是，目前某些国营商业部门的领导同志没有看到这种变化。他们认为农村的购买力将集中在生产资料方面，对日用工业品的销售不会有多大影响。他们认为，往年日用工业品的销售量每年都是增长百分之几，今年也不会超过“百分之几”。
    然而，事实并非如此。以江苏省为例：去年第四季度，全省棉布销售量比1954年同期增长了71％，食糖增长了145％，胶鞋增长了44％，自行车增长了499％。在这样巨大的变化面前如果按照“百分之几”的常规来制定产销计划，结果将是不可设想的。
    新的情况还在日益发展。例如有的省已经准备在各乡架设电话，有的县正在装置有线电广播网，有的合作社已经购买或计划购买收音机、缝纫机等商品。这些都不是坐在办公室里，套着“百分之几”的数目字所能估计到的。
    要使计划制定得切合实际，就要从“百分之几”的常规里跳出来，认真研究形势的发展，充分估计市场的变化，了解群众的需要。制定了切合实际的计划以后，还要尽一切努力，组织品质优良、价格合适、农民需要和喜爱的多种多样的商品，源源不断地供应农村，以保证实现这个计划。而要达到这样的要求，关键又在于：彻底克服工作中的严重的保守思想，改变思想落后于形势发展的现状。
