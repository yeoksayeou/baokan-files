    Shandong and Guangxi Provinces Basically Achieve Agricultural Cooperativization
    Shandong Province has basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. As of mid-January, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives in the province reached 8.1 million, accounting for 75% of the province's total peasant households.
    Currently, the vast majority of the more than 90,000 newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Shandong Province have completed the handling of means of production such as livestock, farm tools, and land, and have established production management committees with poor and lower-middle peasants as the core. Many new cooperatives have formulated their articles of association and agricultural production plans for 1956. In addition to continuing to consolidate and reorganize old and new agricultural cooperatives and further develop new cooperatives, the Party committees and government leading departments at all levels of the CPC are also experimenting with advanced-stage agricultural cooperatives.

    In Guangxi Province, the number of peasant households joining agricultural production cooperatives has reached 86.21% of the province's total peasant households, basically achieving semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. In the areas inhabited by Zhuang and Han farmers in 29 counties including Yongning and Yishan in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives has accounted for more than 95% of the total peasant households. The Pingle Special District, which has a better foundation for agricultural cooperativization, has fully realized semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. The number of advanced cooperatives newly established throughout the province has also increased from 192 to more than 2,000.
    Recently, the local committees, county committees, and district committees of the CPC in Guangxi Province generally held rural cooperativization work conferences. Based on the demands of the local peasant masses to join the cooperatives, they re-revised the agricultural cooperativization development plan. It was decided to merge the province's existing 70,000+ small agricultural production cooperatives into 15,000+ cooperatives, so that several cooperatives in one township would become one cooperative per township.

    山东广西两省基本实现农业合作化
    山东省基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。到1月中旬，全省入社农户达810万户，占全省农户总数的75％。
    现在，山东全省新建立的9万多个农业生产合作社绝大部分已经完成牲畜、农具、土地等生产资料的处理工作，建立了以贫农和下中农为核心的生产管理委员会。许多新社已经制定了社章和1956年的农业生产计划。中共各级党委和政府领导部门除了继续进行新老农业合作社的整顿巩固工作和再发展一批新社外，正在试办高级阶段的农业合作社。（据新华社讯）
    广西省加入农业生产合作社的农户已经达到全省农户总数的86.21％，基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。桂西僮族自治区邕宁、宜山等29个县的僮、汉族农民聚居区，入社农户已占农户总数的95％以上，农业合作化基础较好的平乐专区已全部实现半社会主义的农业合作化。全省新建立的高级社也由192个增加到2，000多个。
    最近，中共广西省各地委、县委和区委普遍召开了农村合作化工作会议，根据各地农民群众入社的要求，重新修订了农业合作化发展规划。决定把全省现有7万多个小的农业生产合作社合并为15，000多个社，使一乡数社变为一乡一社。
