To the Editor:

In 1955, the quality of coal issued to various local Coal Industry Construction Materials Companies (hereinafter referred to as "coal construction companies") by many coal production units in Northeast China generally declined compared to 1954. In August and September, the Fushun Mining Bureau mixed a batch of inferior Grade B coal and passed it off as inferior Grade A coal to the Benxi Coal Construction Company. Stone accounted for 30% to 40% of this batch of coal. On October 20th, they sent 15 truckloads of raw coal to the Haicheng County Coal Construction Company, one of which had a load of 50 tons, containing more than three tons of stones. On October 23rd, the Fuxin Mining Bureau sent 10 truckloads of open-pit coal, totaling 380 tons, to the Jinzhou Coal Construction Company, containing more than 10 tons of stones. Since April, the Guanshan raw coal issued to various local coal construction companies by the Beipiao Mining Bureau has exceeded the prescribed standard for ash content by 30% to 38.6%.

The poor quality of coal has caused great losses to user departments. Units such as the Yingkou Cigarette Factory have already signed coal supply and sales contracts with the coal construction companies. Now, because of the poor quality of Fushun raw coal, production has been affected, and they are requesting returns or changes to other types of coal. "We are buying coal, not stones." This has become a common complaint among residents in many areas when buying coal. On the other hand, some types of coal, such as Beipiao raw coal and Fuxin coal slurry, used to be fast-selling items, but now they cannot be sold due to poor quality.

The coal mines in Northeast China often issue less coal than the required quantity to the coal construction companies. According to key spot checks by more than a dozen city and county coal construction companies in Shenyang, Dalian, and Benxi, more than 437 tons were short (after deducting 1.2% for transportation losses) in 165 railcars of coal. The amount of coal issued by the mines is sometimes insufficient. For example, the waybill for a railcar states that it is loaded with 30 tons of coal, but in reality, it is only loaded with 24 tons, which greatly wastes railway transportation capacity. Some supply and marketing cooperatives are unwilling to operate coal anymore because the reported loss of coal accounts for more than 10% of the total incoming goods, resulting in financial losses.

In addition, the problem of coal mines not delivering goods according to plan is also very serious. The Fushun Mining Bureau changes its coal delivery plan to the coal construction companies several times each month, causing many losses to the coal construction companies.

The Ministry of Coal Industry should take measures to quickly overcome these shortcomings.

### 为什么煤炭质量下降了

　　为什么煤炭质量下降了
　　编辑同志：
    1955年东北地区许多煤炭生产单位发给各地煤业建筑器材公司（以下简称煤建公司）的煤炭，质量一般都比1954年下降。抚顺矿务局八、九月份把一批粗劣乙煤混充粗劣甲煤发给本溪市煤建公司，这批煤里所含的石块占30％到40％；10月20日他们发给海城县煤建公司原煤15车，其中一车载重50吨，里面就有石头三吨多。阜新矿务局10月23日发给锦州市煤建公司的露头煤10车，计380吨，里面有石头10吨多。北票矿务局4月份以来发给各地煤建公司的冠山原煤，灰分超过规定标准的30％到38.6％。
    煤炭质量低劣，一方面给使用部门造成很大的损失。营口市卷烟厂等单位已经同煤建公司签订了煤炭的供销合同，现在因为抚顺原煤质量低劣，影响生产，要求退货或改换其他煤种。“我们是买煤，不是买石头。”这已经成为许多地区的居民购买煤炭的时候所提出的共同意见。另一方面，有些煤种，像北票原煤和阜新煤泥等，过去都是畅销货，现在却由于质量不好已卖不出去。
    东北各煤矿发给煤建公司的煤炭，经常还有数量不足的现象。根据沈阳、旅大、本溪等十几个市、县煤建公司重点抽查的结果，在165个车皮的煤炭中，就亏吨437吨多（已经除去1.2％的运输损耗）。矿山发煤数量不足，有时候一个火车皮的运单写的是装煤30吨，可是实际上只装了24吨，这样，就大大浪费了铁路的运输力。有些供销合作社由于报损煤炭占总进货量的10％以上，赔了钱，就不愿意再经营煤炭了。
    此外，各煤矿不按计划发货的问题也很严重。抚顺矿务局给煤建公司发送煤炭的计划，每个月都要变更几次，使煤建公司受到许多损失。
    煤炭工业部应该采取措施迅速克服这些缺点。
