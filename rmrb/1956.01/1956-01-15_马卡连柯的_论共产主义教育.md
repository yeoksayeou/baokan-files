    Makarenko's "On Communist Education"
    Chen Xia
    Anton Semyonovich Makarenko was an outstanding Soviet educator and writer. His educational works, except for "Lectures on Child Education," are compiled in the book "On Communist Education." The publication of the Chinese translation of this book by the People's Education Press is of great significance.
    Makarenko was the first to realize the Marxist founders' educational ideal of the all-round development of man and the ideal of combining teaching with productive labor. He said: "We hope to cultivate cultured Soviet workers. Therefore, we should give him an education, preferably secondary education, we should give him skilled techniques, we should make him disciplined, he should be politically cultivated and a loyal member of the working class, the Communist Youth League, and the Bolsheviks. ... He should feel his dignity and the dignity of his class, and be proud of it, and he should feel his obligations to his class. He should be good at obeying comrades and also good at commanding comrades. ... He should be happy, energetic, tense, and capable of fighting and building..." (page 56) This is the full picture of a well-rounded person. Makarenko implemented this goal in the Gorky Labor Colony and the Dzerzhinsky Commune. He realized his ideal.
    Since the establishment of the people's democratic regime, our country has put forward the educational policy of cultivating people with all-round development. In June 1954, the Government Administration Council issued the "Instructions on Improving and Developing Secondary Education," which further stipulated that the purpose of education is to cultivate all-round developed members of socialist society. Our educators should undertake this glorious task of transforming the world with unparalleled enthusiasm. Do not think that the ideal of all-round development education is unattainable, nor should you think that the combination of teaching and productive labor must first have certain material conditions. It should be known that the conditions in the Soviet Union at that time were very harsh, but Makarenko not only overcame the difficulties of material conditions, but also realized the ideal of communist education and established indelible merits. We now have the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and we have the advanced experience of the Soviet Union for reference. If we can learn from the spirit of Makarenko, we will certainly be able to gradually implement the educational policy of all-round development.
    The members needed by socialist society are collectivists, and Makarenko aimed at cultivating collectivists as the purpose of education. He repeatedly mentioned this point in articles such as "The Purpose of Education" and "Experience in the Working Methods of Children's Industrial Teams."
    Makarenko not only aimed at cultivating collectivists, but also regarded the collective as the object and means of education. He said: "We believe that the entire collective is the object of our education, and we should direct the organized educational influence to the collective." He also said: "The most practical way to work with an individual is to keep the individual in the collective," and then let the collective rationally influence the individual, "the collective is the teacher of the individual" (page 58). Therefore, Makarenko's famous formula for collectivist education is: to educate in the collective, for the collective, and through the collective.
    Since collectivists can only be cultivated in a collective, in order to carry out collectivist education, every school must unite into a strong collective. The unity of teachers, the unity of students, and the unity between teachers and students are necessary conditions for establishing a school collective. Of course, this kind of unity is unity on a political basis, not unprincipled harmony. If we can seriously study Makarenko's theory and practice of collectivist education, then we can undertake the task of collectivist education.
    In many of our schools, there are still phenomena of poor discipline. Many teachers do not know how to cultivate conscious discipline after the abolition of "corporal punishment." Good answers to this question can also be found in this book.
    Makarenko believed that the basis of conscious discipline is the combination of demand and respect. He has a famous formula: "Demand as much as possible from a person, and respect a person as much as possible." He said: "The requirements we put forward to individuals show respect for the individual's strength and ability; and in our respect, we also express our requirements for the individual." (page 270)
    Combining strict requirements for students with respect for their personality is one of the important principles of communist moral education. Makarenko's practice proves that this principle has an extremely important role in cultivating the conscious discipline of new people in socialist society. From this book, we can not only gain a deep understanding of this principle, but also learn the specific methods to implement this principle.
    Throughout this book, we can see Makarenko's infinite loyalty and love for the Party, the country, and the working people. In his article "On the Individual and Society," he said: "Only the united Bolshevik Party, the working class, and the advanced forces of all working people can engage in socialist construction most brilliantly, most efficiently, and most economically. ... Our enthusiastic trust in the Party and our economic system have created unprecedented personal freedom." (page 10) In his article "Happiness," he is even more filled with love for the motherland, which is about to be built into socialism. He said: "We have learned to be happy people in work, in creation, in victory, and in struggle. ... We have learned to feel happy living in such a country, because now this is our country, not the country of our masters." (page 19) Makarenko was not just talking about happiness, but using his selfless labor to participate in the creation of this happiness. It was this enthusiastic trust in the Party, this sense of happiness in living in a socialist country, and this selfless enthusiasm for labor that enabled Makarenko to have such brilliant achievements and contributions in educational practice and theory.
    Like the Soviet Union, our country also has the Communist Party leading us "to do extremely glorious and great undertakings that our predecessors have never done before." We should feel that living and fighting in our great motherland is infinitely glorious and happy. Therefore, our educators should take Makarenko as an example, be a true patriot, and diligently and bravely undertake the task of cultivating the new generation to become patriots.

    马卡连柯的“论共产主义教育”
    陈侠
    安东·谢妙诺维奇·马卡连柯是苏联杰出的教育家和作家。他的教育论著，除了“儿童教育讲座”一书以外，都被编在“论共产主义教育”一书里。这本书的中译本已由人民教育出版社出版了，这是很有意义的。
    马卡连柯首次实现了马克思主义创始人关于人的全面发展的教育理想和教学跟生产劳动相结合的理想。他说：“我们希望培养出有文化的苏维埃工人。因此，我们应当给他以教育，最好是中等教育，我们应当给他以熟练的技术，我们应当使他守纪律，他应当是在政治上有修养的并且是工人阶级、青年团、布尔什维克的忠实的成员。……他应当感觉到自己的尊严和本阶级的尊严，并引以自豪，他应当感觉到自己对本阶级的义务。他应当善于服从同志也应当善于命令同志。……他应当是快乐的、精神饱满的、紧张的、能够斗争和建设的……”（56页）人，这就是一个全面发展的人的全貌。马卡连柯在高尔基工学团和捷尔任斯基公社就是按照这样的目标来施教的。他实现了自己的理想。
    我国从人民民主政权建立以来，就已提出培养全面发展的人的教育方针。1954年6月政务院发布的“关于改进和发展中学教育的指示”中，又进一步规定以培养社会主义社会全面发展的成员为教育的目的。我们教育工作者就应当以无比的热情负起这个具有改造世界意义的光荣任务。不要以为全面发展的教育理想高不可攀，也不要以为教学跟生产劳动结合必需先有若干物质条件。要知道，苏联当时的条件非常恶劣，可是马卡连柯不仅克服了物质条件的困难，还实现了共产主义教育的理想，建立了不可磨灭的功勋。我们现在有党和政府的正确领导，有苏联先进经验可资借鉴，如果能够学习马卡连柯的精神，是一定可以逐步贯彻全面发展的教育方针的。
    社会主义社会需要的成员是集体主义者，马卡连柯就是以培养集体主义者为教育的目的的。他在“教育的目的”和“儿童工学团工作方法的经验”等文里，都曾再三谈到这一点。
    马卡连柯不但以培养集体主义者为目的，而且以集体为教育的对象和手段。他说：“我们认为整个集体就是我们教育的对象，我们应当把有组织的教育影响针对着集体。”又说：“对个人的最实际的工作方式，是把个人保留在集体内”，然后让集体来合理地影响个人，“集体是个人的教师”（58页）。所以马卡连柯著名的集体主义教育公式就是：在集体中、为了集体、通过集体进行教育。
    既然只有在集体中才能培养集体主义者，为了进行集体主义教育，每个学校就必须团结成为一个坚强的集体。教师的团结一致、学生的团结一致、师生之间的团结一致，就是建立一个学校集体的必要条件。当然，这种团结是在政治基础上的团结，而不是无原则的一团和气。我们如能认真学习马卡连柯关于集体主义教育的理论和实践，那就能把集体主义的教育任务担当起来。
    我们有不少学校现在还有纪律不好的现象，许多教师不知道在废除了“棍棒纪律”以后怎样才能培养起自觉纪律来。关于这个问题，在这本书里也可以找到很好的答案。
    马卡连柯认为自觉纪律的基础是要求跟尊重相结合。他有一个著名的公式：“要尽量多地要求一个人，也要尽可能地尊重一个人。”他说：“我们对个人所提出的要求，就表示出对个人的力量和能力方面的尊重；而在我们的尊重里，同时也表示出我们对个人的要求。”（270页）
    对学生严格要求跟尊重学生人格相结合是共产主义道德教育的重要原则之一。马卡连柯的实践证明这个原则在培养社会主义社会新人的自觉纪律方面具有极其重大的作用。从这本书里，我们不仅可以对这个原则获得深刻的了解，而且可以学习到贯彻这个原则的具体方法。
    在这本书里，我们到处可以看到马卡连柯对党、对国家、对劳动人民的无限忠诚和热爱。他在“论个人与社会”一文中说：“只有统一的布尔什维克党、工人阶级和全体劳动人民的先进部队才能最辉煌地、最有效率地、最经济地从事社会主义建设。……我们对党热情的信赖、我们的经济制度创造了前所未见的个人自由。”（10页）在他的“幸福”一文中，更洋溢着他对即将建成社会主义的祖国的热爱。他说：“我们学会了在工作中、在创造中、在胜利中、在斗争中成为幸福的人。……我们学会了感觉到生活在我们这样的国家中而成为幸福的人，因为现在这是我们的国家，而不是我们主子的国家。”（19页）马卡连柯并不是空谈幸福，而是用自己的忘我的劳动来参加这种幸福的创造的。正是这种对党的热情信赖，这种对生活在社会主义国家里的幸福感，以及这种忘我的劳动热情，才使马卡连柯在教育的实践上和理论上有着那样辉煌的成就和贡献。
    跟苏联一样，我国也有共产党领导着我们“做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。我们应当感觉到生活和斗争在我们伟大的祖国是无限光荣幸福的。因此，我们教育工作者应当以马卡连柯为榜样，做一个真正的爱国主义者，并且勤劳勇敢地把培养新生一代成为爱国主义者这个任务很好地担当起来。
