The Great Victory of the Idea of Peaceful Coexistence

　　1955 was a year of broad advancement for international peace forces and anti-colonialist forces.

　　This year is recorded in post-war history as such: the policy of peaceful coexistence and promoting international cooperation has continuously achieved victories in international affairs; the struggle against colonialism has developed unprecedentedly vigorously in Asian and African countries; and more and more countries are demanding to pursue an independent and autonomous policy, thus causing the "policy of strength" that international aggressive forces are trying their best to pursue to suffer a serious defeat. Today, the will of the people of all countries to demand peace and human progress has become a great and indestructible material force.

　　Bulganin and Khrushchev's reports and speeches at the Supreme Soviet meeting on December 29, 1955, regarding their visits to India, Burma, and Afghanistan, are a brilliant summary of this situation over the past year. From these documents, people can clearly see the great victory of the idea of peaceful coexistence. This idea is the great driving force guiding the development of the international situation.

　　As a prominent symbol of the changes in the past year, the Asian-African Conference and the Geneva Conference were held, and the "Bandung Spirit" and "Geneva Spirit" were produced as a result of the above conferences. The "Bandung Spirit" and "Geneva Spirit" are to demand respect for the independence and sovereignty of all countries, to demand the strengthening of international cooperation, and to resolve international disputes through consultation. They have become an irresistible ideological trend for the people of all countries in the contemporary era to demand the implementation of peaceful coexistence.

　　In the past year, the Soviet Union has occupied the most glorious position in the struggle to safeguard peace and strive for the relaxation of the international situation. The Soviet Union has taken a series of major steps to strengthen trust between countries and promote international cooperation. The Soviet Union's proposal on universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and its proposal on the establishment of a European collective security, have become the common demands of peace-loving people all over the world. The relationship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia has undergone fundamental changes. The Soviet Union has significantly enhanced its friendly relations with Finland, Norway, and Canada; at the same time, its relations with the Federal Republic of Germany have also improved. In particular, thanks to the close contact between Bulganin, Khrushchev, and the leaders and people of India, Burma, and Afghanistan, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Asian countries have entered a new stage. All this shows that the Soviet Union is the main pillar for consolidating peace and promoting the friendship of the people of all countries.

　　The great significance of Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Asian countries lies in the fact that, on the basis of the achievements already made at the Asian-African Conference and the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union further promoted the idea of peaceful coexistence on a broad scale. At that time, however, Western countries were trying their best to limit the "Bandung Spirit" and the "Geneva Spirit"; they even launched a so-called crusade to "eliminate" this spirit.

　　The Soviet Union has taken a heartfelt welcoming attitude towards the emergence of independent India and independent Burma, and has given a very high evaluation of their role in international affairs. The Soviet Union believes that without the participation of China, India, and other Asian countries, no important Asian issues, and not just Asian issues, can be resolved. The Soviet Union condemned the Western countries' colonial rule in Asia, supported India's legitimate demands on the Goa issue, and supported the claims of the Kashmir people and the people of Pashtunistan. The Soviet Union firmly opposes the Southeast Asia Military Group and the Baghdad Pact, because these military groups and treaties are aimed at splitting the unity of Asian countries, intensifying the tense situation in Asia, and attempting to find a legitimate cover for maintaining the remaining rule of colonialism.

　　The Soviet Union sincerely hopes that the industry of Asian countries will achieve great development, and is willing to provide assistance with practical actions. This is something that only a country that takes Marxism-Leninism as its policy guide can do. Bulganin once said during his visit to India: "Industry is the pillar of economic progress and the main and indispensable condition for the independence of any country." This is completely consistent with Prime Minister Nehru's proposition, who has repeatedly emphasized that India must develop heavy industry, and only in this way can it consolidate national independence. The agreements reached between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, and Afghanistan on economic and trade issues have opened up broad avenues for further expanding economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and these countries.

　　The Soviet Union's strengthening of economic cooperation with Asian countries and its sincere provision of necessary economic and technical assistance to these countries is a significant event. Because the Soviet Union's assistance is essentially different from the "assistance" of Western countries, it is carried out on the premise of non-interference in internal affairs and equality and mutual benefit, without any political conditions attached. This assistance is aimed at transforming Asian countries from backward agricultural countries into powerful industrial countries, rather than enslaving these countries and keeping them forever in the position of raw material suppliers and finished product sales markets. The Soviet Union's assistance provides favorable conditions for Asian countries to establish their own national industries and develop peaceful economies, and builds the friendship between the Soviet people and the Asian people on a broader foundation.

　　Peace-loving people all over the world express warm welcome to the increasingly growing friendship between the Soviet people and the Asian people. People believe that this is an important factor in maintaining peace in Asia and world peace. However, some politicians in Western countries are greatly dissatisfied with this. They rudely attack the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy, and they insist that the further development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Asian countries will "damage" the relations between Western countries and Asian countries. Prime Minister Nehru said it well: "Our friendship with the Soviet Union is not directed against anyone." These gentlemen who are chattering and making absurd arguments, if they realize that they are increasingly becoming "unpopular people" in Asian countries, then they should ask themselves: why do you advocate Portugal's forcible occupation of Indian territory and enslavement of the people of Goa? Why do you oppose the legitimate aspirations of the Indian people? Why do you try every possible means to force Asian countries to join the Southeast Asia Military Group or the Baghdad Pact, split Asia, and disrupt Asian security? Facts prove that you dare not give first-class industrial equipment and technology to Asian countries, because you want to maintain the backward state of these countries and keep them as your raw material suppliers and commodity sales markets.

　　This clearly shows two different political lines in current international affairs. The peace and democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and advocate ending the colonial system; a few Western countries headed by the United States still want to pursue the "policy of strength" and maintain colonial rule. Until a few days ago, some people were still "praying" for the restoration of the capitalist system in the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe, the reason for which is nothing more than that they dreamed of continuing to enslave the people of the people's democratic countries who have been liberated.

　　However, the situation over the past year convincingly shows that this policy of strength is facing an increasingly profound crisis. This raises a sharp question for the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Military Group, and the Baghdad Pact: will they continue to follow the line of a few Western powers headed by the United States? Or will they implement a policy of strengthening international cooperation and peaceful coexistence? If they are unwilling to give up the practice of following the "policy of strength", then they will inevitably share the consequences of the failure of the "policy of strength", continue to suffer damage to their national interests, and become increasingly isolated in international affairs.

　　1955 ended as a year of great victory for the idea of peaceful coexistence. The people of all countries who are fighting for peace and human progress are proud of the historical changes in the past year and are full of confidence in the future of mankind. On the road to progress in 1956, people have already heard the louder footsteps of the victorious advance of the cause of peace. Whoever pretends to be deaf here and continues to cling to the bankrupt "policy of strength" is bound to end up in a miserable state.

### 和平共处思想的伟大胜利

　　和平共处思想的伟大胜利
    1955年是国际和平力量和反殖民主义力量广泛前进的一年。
    这一年是作为这样的一年被载入战后史册的。这就是：和平共处和增进国际合作的政策，在国际事务中不断地取得胜利；反对殖民主义的斗争，在亚非国家中有了空前蓬勃的发展；愈来愈多的国家要求奉行独立自主的政策，因而使国际侵略势力竭力奉行的“实力政策”遭到了严重的失败。在今天，各国人民要求和平和人类进步的意志，已经变成了坚不可摧的伟大物质力量。
    1955年12月29日，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上所作的关于访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的报告和发言是过去一年中这种形势的精辟的总结。从这些文件中，人们清楚地看出了和平共处思想的伟大胜利。这种思想是指引国际形势发展的方向的伟大动力。
    作为一年来变化的突出标志，是亚非会议和日内瓦会议的召开，以及由于上述会议而产生的“万隆精神”和“日内瓦精神”。“万隆精神”和“日内瓦精神”，就是要求尊重各国的独立和主权，要求加强国际合作和以协商方式来解决国际纠纷。它们已成为当代各国人民要求实行和平共处的不可抗拒的思想潮流。
    过去一年来，苏联在维护和平和争取和缓国际局势的斗争中，占着最光荣的地位。苏联采取了一系列的重大步骤，来加强国与国之间的信任，促进国际合作。苏联关于普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器的主张，关于建立欧洲集体安全的主张，已成为全世界爱好和平人民共同的主张。苏联和南斯拉夫的关系有了根本的改变。苏联显著地增进了它和芬兰、挪威和加拿大的友好关系；同时，它和德意志联邦共和国的关系也有了改善。特别是，由于布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫和印度、缅甸、阿富汗的领袖们和人民的亲切接触，苏联和亚洲国家的友好关系已经进入了一个新的阶段。这一切说明，苏联是巩固和平和促进各国人民友谊的主要支柱。
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问亚洲国家的巨大意义在于：在亚非会议和日内瓦会议已经取得的成就上，苏联在广阔的范围内进一步推动了和平共处的思想。而当时，西方国家却正在想尽一切办法来限制“万隆精神”和“日内瓦精神”；它们甚至发动了所谓“消灭”这种精神的十字军运动。
    苏联对于独立的印度和独立的缅甸的出现，采取了衷心欢迎的态度，并对它们在国际事务中的作用作了极高的评价。苏联认为，没有中国、印度和其他亚洲国家的参加，任何重要的亚洲问题，而且还不仅仅是亚洲问题，都是不可能获得解决的。苏联谴责了西方国家在亚洲的殖民统治，支持印度在果阿问题上的正当要求，支持克什米尔人民和巴克同尼斯坦人民的主张。苏联坚决反对东南亚军事集团和巴格达条约，因为这些军事集团和条约旨在分裂亚洲国家的团结，加剧亚洲的紧张局势，并且企图为维持殖民主义的残余统治寻找合法的外衣。
    苏联衷心地希望亚洲国家的工业获得巨大的发展，并且愿意以实际行动来进行援助。这是只有以马克思列宁主义为政策指针的国家才能这样做的。布尔加宁在印度访问时曾经说过：“工业是经济进步的支柱，是任何国家的独立的主要的不可缺少的条件”。这同尼赫鲁总理的主张是完全一致的，他曾一再地强调，印度必须发展重工业，唯有如此，才能巩固国家的独立。苏联同印度、缅甸、阿富汗达成的关于经济和贸易问题的协议，为进一步扩大苏联同这些国家的经济合作开辟了广阔的道路。
    苏联加强同亚洲国家的经济合作，真诚地给予这些国家以必要的经济援助和技术援助，是具有重大意义的事件。因为苏联的援助和西方国家的“援助”有着本质上的不同，它是在互不干涉内政和平等互利的前提下进行的，不附有任何的政治条件。这种援助是为了使亚洲国家从落后的农业国变成为强大的工业国，而不是为了奴役这些国家，使它们永远处于原料供应者和制成品销售市场的地位。苏联的援助为亚洲国家建立自己的民族工业和发展和平经济提供了有利的条件，并使苏联人民同亚洲人民的友谊建立在更广阔的基础上面。
    全世界爱好和平的人对于苏联人民和亚洲人民越来越增长的友谊表示热烈的欢迎。人们认为这是维护亚洲和平和世界和平的重要因素。但是，西方国家的一些政客却为此而大为不满。他们粗暴地攻击苏联的和平外交政策，他们硬说苏联同亚洲国家友好关系的进一步发展，会“损害”西方国家同亚洲国家的关系。尼赫鲁总理说的好：“我们和苏联的友谊并不是针对任何人的。”这些嘁嘁喳喳大发谬论的先生们，如果意识到自己在亚洲国家愈来愈成为“不受欢迎的人”，那么他们应该反躬自问：你们为什么主张葡萄牙强占印度的领土，奴役果阿人民？你们为什么反对印度人民的正当愿望？你们为什么千方百计想迫使亚洲国家参加东南亚军事集团或巴格达条约，分裂亚洲，扰乱亚洲的安全？事实证明，你们不敢把头等的工业装备和技术给予亚洲国家，因为你们要保持这些国家的落后状态，使它们老是你们的原料供应者和商品销售市场。
    这就鲜明地表明了目前国际事务中两条不同的政治路线。以苏联为首的和平、民主国家主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，主张结束殖民制度；以美国为首的少数西方国家仍然想奉行“实力政策”和维护殖民统治。直到几天以前，还有人“祈祷”在东欧人民民主国家中恢复资本主义制度，其原因无非是他们梦想继续奴役已经解放了的人民民主国家人民。
    然而，一年来的局势令人信服地说明：这种实力政策已经面临着愈来愈深刻的危机。这就给北大西洋的成员国、东南亚军事集团和巴格达条约的成员国，提出了一个尖锐的问题：它们将继续追随以美国为首的少数西方大国的路线呢？还是执行加强国际合作，和平共处的政策？如果它们不愿意放弃追随“实力政策”的作法，那末它们将必然要分担“实力政策”失败的后果，使自己的民族利益继续遭受损害，在国际事务中愈来愈孤立。
    1955年作为和平共处思想伟大胜利的一年而结束了。为和平和人类进步而斗争的各国人民，对于过去一年中的历史性的变化感到自豪，对于人类的未来充满了信心。在1956年前进的道路上，人们已经听到了和平事业胜利前进的更洪亮的足音。谁要是在这里装聋，继续抱着那已经破产了的“实力政策”，谁就一定要落到可悲的下场。
