A Muddied Account

To the Editor:

　　In March 1955, we heard from an accountant of a Tianjin joint private-public shipping company: "Our company still has 240 yuan belonging to the Inland Waterway Bureau (the Weiyun River system of the Hebei Provincial Inland Waterway Navigation Administration). To return this sum, we went to the Inland Waterway Bureau several times. However, the comrades in the Inland Waterway Bureau insisted that they had no such account and firmly refused to accept the money."

　　From what we understand, similar situations are not uncommon in the Inland Waterway Bureau. For example, in June 1955, the bureau's finance section discovered that eight boatmen owed more than 2,000 yuan in transportation fees. After checking, it was found that these were all lost accounts from 1954. Whether this money has been recovered is something even the head of the finance section doesn't know.

　　On the afternoon of January 10 this year, we went to the bureau's finance section and found that there were 42 accounts with deposits totaling 3,217 yuan and 9 accounts with debts totaling more than 800 yuan in the business transaction ledger; in the private-public shipping transaction ledger, there were 3 accounts with deposits totaling 100 yuan and 13 accounts with debts totaling more than 700 yuan. We asked, "Why don't you take responsibility for clearing up so many outstanding deposits and debts?" The head of the finance section replied, "We don't know whether the deposit accounts actually have deposits or whether the debt accounts actually have debts." It turns out that the accounts in the finance section are a muddied mess.

　　We further asked, "Where did these unclear accounts come from?" The head of the finance section explained, "In 1953, the higher authorities approved our writing off more than 30,000 yuan of 'unrecoverable' 'bad debts.' However, there were still some accounts that couldn't be clarified, so they were transferred to the 1954 accounts. By the beginning of 1955, these accounts were transferred to the 1955 accounts together with the unclear accounts from 1954."

　　Undoubtedly, when we spoke with the head of the finance section, these accounts, along with the unclear accounts from 1955, were being transferred to the 1956 accounts.

　　The people of the whole country are struggling to build socialism ahead of schedule. However, the staff of the Inland Waterway Bureau's finance section are treating the work entrusted to them by the people in this way. Do they still want to take this muddied account into socialism?

### 一笔糊涂账

    一笔糊涂账编辑同志：
    1955年3月，我们听天津市一个民船联营社的会计说：“我们社里还存着内河局（卫运河系河北省内河航运管理局）240元钱。为了归还这笔款子，我们曾经到内河局去了好几次。但是内河局的同志硬说没有这笔账，坚决不收这笔款子。”
    据我们了解，类似情况在内河局是不少的。例如在1955年6月，这个局的财务科就发现8户船民欠着拖运费2，000多元。经过查对，这些都是1954年丢了的账。这些钱是否已经收回来了，连财务科长都不知道。
    今年1月10日下午，我们到这个局的财务科去，发现在业务往来账上有42个户头存款3，217元，有9个户头欠款800多元；在民船往来账上有3个户头存着100元，有13个户头欠着700多元。我们问：“这样多的来往存欠账，为什么不负责清理一下呢？”财务科长的答复是：“这些存款的户头是否真有存款，欠款的户头是否真有欠款，我们也不知道。”原来，财务科里的账目是一笔糊涂账。
    我们又问：“这些不清楚的账，是哪里来的呢？”财务科长解释说：“1953年，上级批准我们报销了3万多元‘收不回来’的‘呆账’。可是，还有一些账弄不清，就移到1954年的账上了。到1955年初，这些账目又同1954年的弄不清的账一起移到1955年的账上了。”
    毫无疑问，当我们同这位财务科长谈话的时候，这些账又连同1955年弄不清的账一起移到1956年的账上了。
    全国人民正在为提早建成社会主义而斗争。内河局财务科的工作人员却这样对待人民交给他们的工作。难道他们还想把这笔糊涂账带到社会主义去吗？
