    Let the Worker Elders Always Eat Fresh and Delicious Vegetables
To the Editor:
    We are a vegetable production cooperative from the suburbs of Taiyuan. We are now reporting to you on our production situation in the two years since the establishment of the cooperative. It is our cooperative's glorious task to enable urban workers and the general public to eat fresh and delicious vegetables all year round. Since the establishment of the cooperative, we have made many efforts in this regard, and as a result, vegetable production has greatly increased. Although we suffered a severe drought in 1955, our cooperative still harvested 9,650 jin of vegetables per mu, which is 11.6% higher than the yield of individual farmers. In the past two years, our cooperative has supplied more than 8 million jin of various vegetables to factory and mine workers and urban residents.
    In the past two years, we have also increased the planting of 20 new varieties of vegetables, such as snow cabbage, spoon cabbage, and milk eggplant, to meet diverse needs. In order to gradually achieve "evergreen in all seasons and year-round supply" of vegetables in our cooperative, and to eliminate "surpluses in peak seasons and shortages in off-seasons," we have adopted seedling cultivation methods that promote early vegetable maturity, such as "seedling beds," "cold frames," "nutrient pots," "glass-covered seedling raising," and "greenhouses" since the spring of 1954. In 1955, we already had 32 "greenhouses," 18 "soil greenhouses," and 15 "sunken greenhouses," in which we cultivated more than ten kinds of vegetables, producing more than 25,000 jin of vegetables. In addition, in the winter of 1955, we also used methods such as "live cellars" and "dead cellars" to store more than 2.17 million jin of oilseed rape and cabbage.
    With the increase in production, the income and living standards of our cooperative members have also improved. In 1955, among the 169 cooperative member households, except for two households whose income was reduced due to excessive sick leave, the income of all the rest exceeded that of 1954. All of the original 57 poor peasant households have been elevated to the level of new middle peasants. In the past two years, 12 households in the entire cooperative have repaired 34 rooms, and 10 households have built 24 new rooms; 35 people have also bought bicycles.
    The reason why our cooperative has been able to achieve the above results is inseparable from the strong support of the worker elders. Without the diesel engines manufactured by the worker elders, it would be much more difficult for us to water our vegetable fields, and we would not have been able to convert 187 mu of dry land into irrigated land in two years. In order to further develop vegetable production and better support the worker elders, our cooperative has been transformed into an advanced cooperative of a completely socialist nature.

### 让工人老大哥常年吃到新鲜可口的蔬菜

    让工人老大哥常年吃到新鲜可口的蔬菜编辑同志：
    我们是太原市郊区的一个蔬菜生产合作社。现在我们向你们报告一下建社两年来的生产情况。使城市职工和广大居民能够常年吃到新鲜可口的蔬菜，是我们合作社的光荣任务。建社以后，我们在这方面作了很多努力，因此蔬菜的产量大大提高了。1955年虽然遭受了严重的旱灾，社里的蔬菜每亩仍然收到9，650斤，比单干农民的产量高11.6％。两年来，我们社共供应厂矿职工和城市居民各种蔬菜800多万斤。
    两年来，我们还增种了雪里红、瓢儿菜、牛奶茄子等20样新品种蔬菜，以满足多方面的要求。为了使社里的蔬菜逐步做到“四季常青，常年供应”，不再“旺季过剩，淡季缺少”，从1954年春天开始，我们采用了“秧畦”、“冷床”、“营养钵”、“玻璃烤秧”和“温室”等促使蔬菜提早成熟的育苗法。1955年我们已经有“温室”32间，“土温室”18间，“阳畦”15个；里面一共栽培蔬菜十多种，可产菜25，000多斤。此外，1955年冬天我们还用“活窖”“死窖”等方法，贮藏油菜、白菜等217万多斤。
    随着生产的提高，我们社员的收入和生活水平也提高了。1955年169户社员中，除了有两户因病误工太多以外，其余收入都超过了1954年。原有的57户贫农已全部上升为新中农。两年来，全社有12户补修房子34间，10户新盖房子24间；有35个人还买了自行车。
    我们社所以能够取得以上成绩，是和工人老大哥们的大力支援分不开的。如果没有老大哥们制造的柴油机，我们菜地浇水就会困难得多，而且也不能在两年内把187亩旱地改成了水地。为了进一步发展蔬菜生产，更好地支援工人老大哥们，我们社已经转为完全社会主义性质的高级社。
