Urgent Documents Sleeping in Drawers

To the Editor:

	On December 12, 1955, the Ministry of Agriculture sent a document concerning the funding of jute seeds to the Ministry of Finance for processing. However, the Ministry of Agriculture never received a response. Because the issue urgently needed to be resolved, the Ministry of Agriculture kept receiving telegrams and phone calls from lower-level institutions inquiring about the matter, and could only respond with "The Ministry of Finance has not yet replied."

	As 1955 was coming to an end, the Ministry of Agriculture had to request the supervisory unit of the Ministry of Finance to investigate the whereabouts of the document. After investigation, it was confirmed that the document had been forwarded to the Budget Department. However, the responsible comrades of the Local Budget Execution Section, the Central Budget Execution Section, and the Comprehensive Section of the Budget Department all claimed to know nothing about it. After searching high and low, the urgent document was finally found in the drawer of Comrade Han Bi of the Local Budget Execution Section on December 29. Why had it not been processed for so long? Comrade Han Bi stammered and said, "Because this document is not my responsibility." Does a document that is not one's responsibility justify being shelved? The leadership of the Ministry of Finance should criticize Comrade Han Bi for this irresponsible behavior and improve the handling of official documents.

### 紧急文件在抽屉里睡觉

    紧急文件在抽屉里睡觉编辑同志：
    1955年12月12日，农业部把一个有关黄麻种籽经费问题的文件送请财政部处理。但是农业部却一直没有得到答复。因为问题急需解决，农业部不断收到下级机构来催问意见的电报和电话，只好都用“财政部还没有答复”这句话来应付。
    1955年眼看着就完了，农业部不得不要求财政部监察单位检查这个文件的下落。经过调查，文件确已转到预算司。但是，预算司的地方预算执行科、中央预算执行科和综合科三个单位的负责同志都说不知道这回事。找来找去，到12月29日才发现这个紧急文件是在地方预算执行科韩壁同志的抽屉里。为什么这样久没有处理呢？韩壁同志吞吞吐吐地说：“因为这个文件不归我办。”不归自己办的文件难道就可以积压吗？财政部领导方面应该对韩壁同志这种不负责任的作风提出批评，并且改进处理公文的工作。
