The criminal Wang Cheng, who commanded the arrest of Li Dazhao, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, in 1927, has recently been arrested by the Shenyang Municipal Public Security Bureau.

The counter-revolutionary criminal Wang Cheng once served as a platoon leader of the military police, lieutenant adjutant of the military police, major general security captain, and police chief under the warlord Zhang Zuolin. On April 5, 1927, the Feng系 (Feng clique) warlords, in collusion with imperialism, decided to arrest Comrade Li Dazhao. Before dawn on April 6, the "Inspector General" of the Feng系 (Feng clique) warlord's Beijing Police Department instructed his confidant, Security Captain Wang Cheng, by telephone regarding this conspiracy. This criminal immediately took action, selecting eighty or ninety subordinates, along with military police and secret agents, totaling more than 500 people, to tightly surround Comrade Li Dazhao's residence. The criminal Wang Cheng, wielding a broadsword, directed his subordinates to arrest Comrade Li Dazhao and 15 others, and also took Comrade Li Dazhao's wife and children to the police department. Finally, he extensively searched Comrade Li Dazhao's residence until dark, confiscating a large number of revolutionary documents and other items back to the police department to claim credit. The criminal Wang Cheng was rewarded with a "Wenhu Medal" for his meritorious service in persecuting communists.

Although the counter-revolutionary criminal Wang Cheng had been in hiding for more than 20 years, he was finally exposed by the people in this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. Not long ago, the Shenyang Municipal Public Security Bureau received a letter from the people, exposing Wang Cheng, who lived at No. 34, Shenshu Hutong, Beishi District, Shenyang City. The letter also included a half-length portrait of this criminal. This letter not only exposed Wang Cheng's arrest of Comrade Li Dazhao but also exposed his many crimes of persecuting the people. Based on this clue, the Shenyang Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately conducted an investigation and, after confirming Wang Cheng's criminal behavior from the archives of warlord Zhang Zuolin's police department, arrested Wang Cheng according to law.

    迫害李大钊同志的罪犯落网
    在1927年指挥逮捕中国共产党创始人之一李大钊同志的罪犯王澄，最近已经被沈阳市公安机关逮捕。
    反革命罪犯王澄曾任军阀张作霖的宪兵排长、宪兵上尉副官、少将保安队长和警察署长等职务。1927年4月5日，和帝国主义有勾结的奉系军阀决定逮捕李大钊同志。4月6日拂晓前，奉系军阀北京警察厅的“督察长”就把这个阴谋用电话指示他的亲信保安队长王澄。这个罪犯立刻行动起来，挑选了八、九十名部下和宪兵、特务等共500多人，把李大钊同志的住处紧紧包围。罪犯王澄手执大战刀，指挥着部下逮捕了李大钊同志等16人，并且把李大钊同志的夫人和小孩也带到警察厅，最后还大肆搜查李大钊同志的住处直到天黑，把大批革命文献等物劫回警察厅请功。罪犯王澄因为这次迫害共产党人有功，得到了一枚“文虎章”的奖赏。
    反革命罪犯王澄虽然隐藏了20多年，可是在这次肃清反革命分子的斗争中终于被人民检举出来。不久以前沈阳市公安机关收到一封人民来信，检举住在沈阳市北市区神树胡同34号的王澄，信纸上还贴着这个罪犯的一张半身像片。这封信不仅检举王澄逮捕过李大钊同志，还检举了他许多迫害人民的罪行。沈阳市公安机关根据这个线索立刻进行调查，并且从军阀张作霖的警察厅的档案里证实了王澄的罪恶行为以后，便依法把王澄逮捕。　（新华社）
