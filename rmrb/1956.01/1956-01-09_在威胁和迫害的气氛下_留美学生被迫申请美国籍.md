　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: Our reporter reports: Two Chinese students who were once coerced into applying for American citizenship have managed to return to the motherland and have renounced their American citizenship.
　　These two students are Yang Jike, a Master of Metallurgy from Ohio State University, and his wife, Wang Anqi, a Master of Zoology from Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Their experience fully exposes the atmosphere of threat surrounding overseas Chinese in the United States who yearn to return to their motherland.
　　Yang Jike told reporters, "When we were in the United States, we already had two children, and we were very afraid of losing our jobs, and even afraid that the American authorities would send us to Taiwan like the Chinese prisoners of war in the Korean War.
　　"In the United States, any Chinese who publicly announces that he wants to return to China will be hunted down like a criminal. Personnel from the Immigration Bureau of Columbus, Ohio, often troubled us at our workplace and at home. They wanted us to report to them on schedule and repeatedly interrogated us.
　　"We knew that there was no hope of running to another country. Some of our friends had tried this way to return home, but without success."
　　Yang Jike said that under violent coercion, they finally had to apply for American citizenship. He added, "We have goodwill and respect for the American people, but since we are Chinese, naturally we have never had the desire to become American citizens."
　　He continued: "We felt that this might relieve the unbearable pressure imposed on us by the Immigration Bureau. On the other hand, we might also find an opportunity to leave the United States as American citizens."
　　But they never found such an opportunity until they saw a news item in a Chinese newspaper about the agreement between China and the United States regarding the return of civilians.
　　"Even at this time, we didn't dare say that we intended to return to mainland China. We only bought tickets to Hong Kong without saying what we were going to do there.
　　"We are not very brave people, just ordinary people who love our motherland," said Yang Jike, "but for Chinese people currently in the United States, it is indeed extremely difficult to leave the United States and return to their motherland."

    在威胁和迫害的气氛下
　　留美学生被迫申请美国籍
    新华社8日讯　本社记者报道：曾经被威吓所迫而申请美国国籍的两位中国留学生已经设法回到了祖国，并且抛弃了他们的美国国籍。
    这两位留学生是美国俄亥俄州立大学冶金学硕士杨纪珂和他的妻子，麻萨诸塞州威尔斯来学院动物学硕士汪安琦。他们的一段经历充分揭露了笼罩在渴望返回祖国的旅美华侨身上的威胁气氛。
    杨纪珂对记者谈道，“我们在美国的时候已经有了两个孩子，很害怕丢掉职业，甚至于害怕美国当局会把我们像对待朝鲜战争中的中国战俘一样送到台湾去。
    “在美国，不管那个中国人，只要他公开宣布他想要回国，就要像罪犯一样受到追逐。俄亥俄州哥伦布斯城移民局的人员就常到我们工作的地点和家里去麻烦我们。他们要我们按期向他们报告并且反复地盘问我们。
    “我们知道要想跑到另外一个国家去是没有希望的。我们有些朋友已经试过这条回国的路，但是没有成功。”
    杨纪珂说，在暴力威逼之下，他们终于不得不申请了美国国籍。他又补充说，“我们对美国人民怀有善意和尊敬，不过既然我们是中国人，很自然地我们从来也没有存过成为美国公民的愿望。”
    他接着说：“我们觉得这样也许可以免除移民局加在我们身上的难以忍受的威迫的压力。另一方面，我们还可能以美国公民的身份找一个机会离开美国。”
    但是他们总找不到这样一个机会，直到他们在一家华侨报纸上看到了关于中美双方有关平民回国的协议的消息。
      “甚至于在这个时候我们还不敢说我们打算回到中国大陆来。我们只买了到香港的船票，而没有说到那儿去做什么。
    “我们并不算什么很勇敢的人，只是爱护自己祖国的普通老百姓而已。”杨纪珂说，“不过对于目前在美国的中国人说来，要想离开美国回到祖国来的确是极其困难的。”
