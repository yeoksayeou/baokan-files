To the Editor:

    The gynecology department of the First Hospital of Rehe Province experienced four serious accidents of responsibility between July and September 1955.

    On July 6th, a pregnant woman was referred by the Chengde City Health Station. The health station's preliminary diagnosis was that she was carrying twins. However, Li Rongzhi, a doctor in the gynecology department of the First Hospital of Rehe Province, glanced at her and insisted that it was not twins, but a single transverse presentation, deciding to perform an internal version procedure. The operation was performed three times in a row; one of them was performed by Dr. Qiang Xiaomei, who did not carefully examine the mother either, but followed Dr. Li Rongzhi's disposition. As a result, the mother had a premature delivery on the morning of July 13th. Both children were harmed, and the adult also suffered undue pain.

    On the afternoon of July 18th, the Chengde City Outpatient Department referred another sick pregnant woman to the hospital requesting emergency treatment. The pregnant woman was two months pregnant and suddenly experienced abdominal pain, pale face, cold sweats, weak pulse, and a continuous drop in blood pressure. The internal medicine doctor on duty in the emergency room at the time saw that the patient's condition was very similar to surgical acute abdomen and asked the surgeon for a consultation. However, the surgeon was "busy" playing chess and only came after being urged several times. After diagnosis, it was estimated that it might be a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, so Dr. Li Rongzhi from the gynecology department was called. It was almost time to get off work, and Li Rongzhi only instructed a nurse to inject the patient with two doses of penicillin and let the patient go home. The next day, before the hospital started work, the patient was carried to the emergency room again; but this time, it was too late to save the patient's life! The deceased's husband was so sad that he shed tears; but Li Rongzhi mocked him heartlessly, saying, "You're a grown man, what are you crying for!"

    On August 30th, a pregnant woman came to the hospital for a dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure. The doctors in the gynecology department considered it a "minor operation" and allowed an intern in the gynecology department to perform it, with Dr. Qiang Shulan as an assistant. During the operation, the doctors only cared about chatting idly and did not inject the patient with oxytocin, causing the uterus to become soft and perforated with bleeding. Later, the director of the gynecology department ran over and saw that the patient's uterus had been perforated, and intestines had leaked out of the hole. In order to conceal this mistake, they made an excuse to perform an abdominal operation on the patient and removed a section of the intestine.

    More than ten days later, another pregnant woman came to the hospital for a D&C procedure. At that time, Dr. Qiang Xiaomei, who was performing the operation, said, "We must pay attention this time! It would be unacceptable if we perforated the patient's uterus again." It is almost unbelievable that this pregnant woman's uterus was indeed perforated! The reason was the same as last time, again no oxytocin was injected.

    Why have medical accidents occurred repeatedly in the gynecology department of the First Hospital of Rehe Province? We believe that this cannot be justified merely by lightly dismissing it as "poor technique, carelessness," etc. The relevant leading authorities should conduct an in-depth investigation, find out the reasons, and take serious action.

　　前热河省第一医院妇科医疗事故频繁
　　编辑同志：
    热河省立第一医院妇科在1955年7月到9月，连续发生了四次严重的责任事故。
    7月6日，承德市保健站介绍来一位孕妇。这个孕妇经过保健站初步诊断，怀的是双胎。但是省立第一医院妇科李荣芝大夫随便看了一下，就硬说不是双胎，而是单胎横位，决定要做倒转正位手术。手术一连做了三次；其中有一次是强笑梅大夫做的，她对产妇也没有认真检查，就按照李荣芝大夫的处置办了。这样，产妇在7月13日早产了。两个孩子都被残害了，大人也受到了不应有的痛苦。
    7月18日下午，承德市门诊部又介绍一位患病的孕妇到医院来要求急诊。这位孕妇妊娠两个月了，突然发生腹痛，颜面苍白、冷汗、脉搏频弱、血压持续性下降等病状。当时在急诊室里值班的内科大夫，一看病人的情况很像是外科急腹痛，就要求外科大夫会诊。但是外科大夫正在“忙”着下象棋，一连催请了几次才来；经诊断，估计可能是子宫外妊破裂，于是又请来了妇科李荣芝大夫。这时快要下班了，李荣芝只吩咐一位护士给病人注射两支青霉素，就让病人回家去了。第二天医院还没有上班，病人又被抬到了急诊室；但是这一次，病人的生命已经来不及挽救了！死者的丈夫当时就难过得流了泪；可是李荣芝竟毫无心肝地嘲笑他说：“挺大一个男人，还哭哪！”
    8月30日，一位孕妇来医院做刮子宫的手术。妇科的大夫们认为这是“小手术”，就让一位在妇科实习的大夫去做，由强淑兰大夫当助手。在做手术的时候，大夫们只顾闲谈，没有给病人注射缩宫剂，因此使子宫柔软而穿孔出血，后来妇科主任跑来一看，发现病人的子宫被刮破了，破洞中已经漏出了肠子，他们为了隐瞒这个错误，又找了个借口给病人做了开腹手术，切除了一段肠子。
    隔了十几天，医院里又来了一位要做刮子宫手术的孕妇。当时，做手术的强笑梅大夫还说，这回可得注意啦！要是再把病人的子宫刮破了就说不过去了。简直令人难于相信，这位孕妇的子宫竟真的也被刮破了！原因同上次一样，又是没有注射缩宫剂。
    为什么热河省立第一医院妇科一再发生医疗事故呢？我们认为，这决不能仅仅用“技术不高、粗枝大叶”等轻描淡写的借口来作为理由，有关领导机关应该深入进行检查，弄清原因，并且进行严肃的处理。　辛生　冀
