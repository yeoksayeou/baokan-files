Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 3rd: The Vietnam News Agency reports: President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam received a reporter from the Indian "New Century" Weekly on December 22, 1955, and answered questions he had posed earlier. The questions and answers are as follows:

    Question: In your opinion, what are the results of the Soviet leaders' visit to India and other Asian countries?

    Answer: The Soviet leaders' visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan is a very significant international event. It has greatly strengthened the friendship and cooperation between these three countries and the Soviet Union, and it powerfully demonstrates the correctness of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It has greatly consolidated peace: when more than half of the world's people, namely the people of the Soviet Union, India, China, and other democratic countries, unite to create an impregnable wall to defend peace, peace is greatly consolidated.

    The Vietnamese people especially welcome the joint statement issued by the leaders of the Soviet Union, India, and Burma on the need to strictly observe the Geneva Accords in our country.

    Question: Throughout your life, you have led a glorious struggle against colonialism, a struggle that has won worldwide praise and has become a source of inspiration for patriots throughout Asia. In your estimation, how is this struggle to rid the world of colonialism progressing now?

    Answer: In the face of the heroic struggles of Asian and African countries for freedom and independence and the victories they have won, colonialism is collapsing rapidly.

    Question: What is your opinion of the imperialists' practice of establishing various military blocs and bases to encircle China, Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East?

    Answer: These military blocs and bases are a threat to peace in Asia and the world.

    Question: What is your opinion of the growing movement for the solidarity of the peoples of Asia and Africa?

    Answer: This is a very good thing. For the benefit of our Asian and African peoples, I hope this movement will develop more rapidly and become more active.

    Question: The restoration of peace in Vietnam is a great victory for the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people and all peace-loving people in the world. In your view, how can this struggle be further developed in the face of enormous difficulties to achieve Vietnam's complete independence and unification?

    Answer: No matter how great the difficulties may be, we will certainly be able to achieve our country's independence and unification by peaceful means, because all the Vietnamese people demand it and are standing with us. Nothing can stop the sun from rising. No one can violate the will of the people.

    Question: How do you assess the existing relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and India, and what should be done to develop these relations?

    Answer: The relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and India are very friendly, and these relations will be strengthened more and more.

    Question: What New Year's greetings would you like to extend to the people of India?

    Answer: On behalf of my compatriots and myself, I would like to extend to our friends – the people of India – the best wishes for a happy and prosperous New Year.

    On the same day, Pham Van Dong, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, received the same reporter and answered the questions posed by the reporter.

    问：在你看来，苏联领导者访问印度和亚洲其他国家的结果如何？
    答：苏联领导者访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗，是一个非常重大的国际事件，它大大地加强了这三个国家和苏联之间的友好和合作，它有力地证明了和平共处五项原则的正确性。它大大地巩固了和平：当世界上半数以上的人民、即苏联、印度、中国和其他民主国家的人民团结起来造成一道保卫和平的铜墙铁壁的时候，和平就得到很大的巩固。
    越南人民特别欢迎苏联、印度和缅甸的领导者所发表的关于必须在我国严格遵守日内瓦协定的联合声明。
    问：在你整个的一生中，你曾经领导过反对殖民主义的光荣的斗争，这种斗争已经赢得全世界的赞扬，并且成为鼓舞整个亚洲爱国者的一种源泉。依你估计，这种使世界摆脱殖民主义的斗争现在进行得怎样？
    答：在面对亚非国家争取自由和独立的英勇斗争以及它们所赢得的胜利的情况下，殖民主义正在很快地崩溃。
    问：你对于帝国主义者建立各种军事集团和基地来包围中国、东南亚、印度和中东的这种做法有什么看法？
    答：这些军事集团和基地是对亚洲和世界和平的威胁。
    问：你对亚非人民团结的日益壮大的运动有什么看法？
    答：这是一件很好的事情。为了我们亚非人民的利益，我希望这个运动发展得更迅速，变得更活跃。
    问：越南和平的恢复是越南人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的英勇斗争的一个伟大胜利。在你的心目中，怎样在种种巨大困难的情况下进一步发展这个斗争以达到越南的完全独立和统一？
    答：不管可能存在着多大的困难，我们一定能够以和平方法来取得我国的独立和统一，因为全体越南人民要求做到这一点，而且是同我们站在一起的。任何东西都不能阻止太阳的升起。任何人都不能违反人民的意　 志。 
    问：你对越南民主共和国和印度现有的关系怎样估计，应该做些什么来发展这种关系？
    答：越南民主共和国和印度之间的关系是非常友好的，这种关系将会愈来愈加强。
    问：在这过新年的时候，你希望向印度人民致些什么祝词？
