    A Message to People in Cotton-Growing Areas Inside the Customs
    By our reporter Shen Shi
    The headquarters of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps often receives letters from cotton-producing areas inside the customs. Some ask for introductions to the high-yield cotton growing experience in the Manas River Basin, some ask for the donation of superior cotton seeds, and some want to send people to learn. The people of the Production and Construction Corps have not disappointed their friends from afar. They have written many reply letters, allocated hundreds of tons of selected cotton seeds, and also sent Liu Xuefo, who created the national record for the highest yield of cotton per unit area, and several other comrades to Anyang County in Henan Province and Shanghai to spread cotton-growing experience. However, letters continue to arrive. The men and women soldiers of the Manas River Basin saw in the newspaper that the cotton-producing areas inside the customs wanted to promote Xinjiang's high-yield cotton-growing experience, and they said: We don't have much experience yet; however, it would be good for the people there to know the road we have traveled.

    Get to Know Them First
    Friends! If you have the opportunity to come to the Xigobi of the Manas River Basin and visit the soldiers of the 3rd Company of a certain unit there, they will definitely say: "Many comrades in our company only started growing cotton after liberation, and some had never even seen cotton seedlings in their hometowns!" However, in 1955, this company had 103 mu of cotton fields, with an average yield of 945 jin of seed cotton per mu; among them, 45 mu had an average yield of 1,004 jin per mu. Not far from this company is the cotton field of Liu Xuefo's platoon. In 1955, the soldiers of this platoon planted 491 mu of cotton, with an average yield of 550 jin of seed cotton per mu; among them, 14 mu of cotton field had an average yield of 1,195 jin per mu; and among them, 1.05 mu of land had an average yield of 1,392 jin per mu. This platoon has 26 soldiers, none of whom had grown cotton before. Although Liu Xuefo is now an expert in cotton planting, has he grown cotton before? Speaking of it, he only helped his father weed the cotton fields a few times when he was 8 or 9 years old; at 11, he grazed cattle for the landlord; and at 14, he was dragged into the army by the Chiang bandits. Their rich cotton-growing experience has been accumulated in the short few years after liberation.

    Breaking a Stale Saying
    The Manas River Basin has a large amount of wasteland. In 1949, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army came here. In order to reduce the burden on the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, the soldiers used earth rakes and two-ox plows to reclaim large areas of wasteland and planted winter wheat, rice, and corn.
    In 1950, this unit prepared to try planting cotton. When Barat, the production consultant of Wulawusu Farm, heard about it, he said in surprise: "I have grown crops for more than 30 years, and I have never seen cotton in this area." "The weather is cold north of the Tianshan Mountains, and cotton cannot be planted." For many years, this saying has been circulating.
    The frost-free period in the Manas River Basin is only about 150 days, and dry northwest winds often blow in the summer, and the temperature difference between day and night is very large; however, the summer has long sunshine hours, which is suitable for cotton growth. Some of the land here contains saline-alkali, and some are heavy clay; however, the humus layer is quite thick. The year-round snow-capped Tianshan Mountains have a steady stream of snow water, which can be controlled by artificial means for irrigation. The commanders of the production troops, headed by Commander Wang Zhen, were old hands at reclaiming wasteland in Naniniwan, northern Shaanxi. Although they have never grown cotton, they trust science, and they have a creative work attitude and the ambition to conquer nature. They analyzed all the conditions, ignored all kinds of opposing arguments, and affirmed that cotton could be planted in the Manas River Basin.
    Everyone was unfamiliar with planting cotton for the first time. When sowing, some broadcasted, and some dibbled. Individual companies soaked the seeds in boiling water and scalded them to death. Some sprouted the seeds, and they withered as soon as they were scattered on the ground. The sowing time differed by more than ten days; seedlings had already emerged in the fields in the east, and sowing had just begun in the fields in the west. There was even less talk of close planting, pruning, and cultivating and fertilizing. At the end of the autumn harvest, each mu produced only twenty or thirty jin of seed cotton.
    Although the yield was low, Old Man Barat saw cotton for the first time in this place.

    400 Jin Per Mu
    In the winter of 1952, Soviet expert Titov arrived in Xinjiang. Comrade Wang Zhen humbly asked him for advice and put forward the high-yield requirement of creating an average yield of 400 jin of seed cotton per mu on 20,000 mu of cotton in the Manas River Basin.
    When some commanders of farms and companies heard the planned output of cotton in 1953, they were shocked and felt that jumping from an average of twenty or thirty jin per mu to 400 jin was undoubtedly "rash advance."
    Some soldiers said playfully: "Even with the cotton stalks, it won't reach 400 jin."
    Titov said: "As long as you conscientiously learn advanced experience, you can guarantee to reach 400 jin."
    The Party Committee of the Production and Construction Corps resolutely implemented the Xinjiang Military Region's plan and Titov's technical measures, and Commander Tao Zhiyue also personally went to various farms to mobilize and inspect.
    When the spring breeze thawed, the high-yield movement of 20,000 mu of cotton fields began.

    How Was It Done?
    It is indeed not easy to make the yield of cotton reach 400 jin per mu.
    Today, when people walk into every farm in the Manas River Basin, they can always see bags of cotton seeds in those dry, disinfected houses. These cotton seeds are selected by the soldiers one by one. However, what was the situation before sowing in 1953? The cotton seeds were piled up everywhere, and some cotton seeds were mixed with sunflower and corn seeds. When the headquarters stipulated that cotton seeds should be selected one by one, the soldiers were unwilling. At Quanshui Di Farm, soldier Li Fuen was selecting cotton seeds, and the regimental commander came to the company. Li Fuen asked the regimental commander: "Why do cotton seeds have to be selected one by one? My father has grown cotton all his life and has never selected them like this." Li Fuen lived in Luoyang, Henan, and he knew very well how cotton was grown in his hometown.
    "Do you know why cotton seeds need to be selected one by one?" the regimental commander asked.
    "Isn't it just Titov causing trouble for us?"
    "Have you been to the livestock team?" the regimental commander asked again.
    "Yes."
    "Why do you have to pick good rams for sheep breeding?"
    "Regimental Commander! No need to say more, I understand."

    When the time came to thin the seedlings, the farm headquarters stipulated that thinning rulers should be used, and 7,500 plants should be left per mu. The soldiers were very confused when they heard this.
    "Leaving it so dense will suffocate the cotton."
    "Leaving it so dense will not produce bolls."
    When the company commanders were in the fields, the soldiers would use thinning rulers; as soon as the commanders left, the thinning rulers would be thrown aside. When the 3rd Company Commander of Wulawusu Farm saw soldier Hou Shiwen thinning seedlings, he walked up to Hou Shiwen and asked him why he didn't use a thinning ruler.
    "My two eyes are the ruler, and my two hands are also the ruler." Hou Shiwen replied like this.
    The company commander inspected the seedlings that had been thinned and found that too few seedlings were left.
    "Why did you leave it so sparse?"
    "Not dense, not sparse, two thousand six or seven. Who in Caochang Village, Qishan County, Shaanxi Province, doesn't leave seedlings like this?"
    Thoughts like Hou Shiwen's were quite common among the soldiers.
    Each company educated the soldiers to overcome conservative ideas by calculating detailed accounts; the soldiers realized that if more than 7,000 seedlings were left per mu, each plant would only need to produce 10 bolls, and if each boll weighed 3 centimeters, the yield would exceed 400 jin.
    In the first year of promoting advanced experience, every technical measure, such as cultivating, fertilizing, ditch irrigation, pruning, etc., was explained to the soldiers with such painstaking efforts.
    The result of the autumn harvest that year was that the average yield of 20,000 mu of cotton fields was 402 jin per mu. The living facts educated everyone who planted cotton in the Manas River Basin.

    Over the past few years, the soldiers of the Manas River Basin have tasted bitterness, taken detours, and fought hard struggles against insect pests and diseases, against the ever-changing climate, and against all kinds of conservative ideas in the process of planting cotton! People in the cotton-growing areas inside the customs, if you remember the road they have traveled, you can take fewer detours.

    写给关内植棉区的人们
    本报记者　沈石
    新疆生产建设部队的指挥部经常接到从关内产棉区寄来的信，写信的人有的要求介绍玛纳斯河流域棉花丰产的经验，有的要求赠送优良的棉种，有的想派人前来学习。生产建设部队的人没有辜负远方朋友的期望，他们写了许多封回信，拨出了成百吨经过粒选的棉籽，还把创造棉花单位面积产量全国最高纪录的刘学佛和别的几位同志派到河南安阳县和上海市，传播植棉经验。但是，信件还是不断地寄来。玛纳斯河流域的男女战士们从报纸上看到关内的产棉区要推广新疆的棉花丰产经验，他们说：我们的经验还不多；不过，让那儿的人知道我们走过的一段路，也是有好处的。
    先认识他们
    朋友！假若你们有机会来到玛纳斯河流域的西戈壁，访问那儿某部三连的战士们，他们一定会说：“我们连队里，有许多同志只是在解放后才开始种棉花，有的在家乡连棉苗也没见过哩！”可是，这个连，1955年有103亩棉田，每亩平均产籽棉945斤；其中有45亩，每亩平均产1，004斤。离这个连不远，就是刘学佛排的棉田。这个排的战士，1955年种了491亩棉花，每亩平均产籽棉550斤；其中有14亩棉田，每亩平均产1，195斤；其中又有1.05亩地，每亩平均产1，392斤。这个排有26名战士，从前都没有种过棉花。刘学佛现在虽然是植棉能手，他过去是不是也种过棉花呢？说起来，他只在8、9岁的时候帮助他父亲拔过几次棉田的草；11岁，他给地主放牛；14岁，被蒋匪拉去当了兵。他们的丰富的植棉经验是在解放后短短几年里积累起来的。
    打破了一个陈旧的说法
    玛纳斯河流域有着大量的荒地。1949年，人民解放军某部来到这里。为了减轻新疆各族人民的负担，战士们用砍土镘、二牛抬杠开垦出大片的荒地，种上了冬麦、水稻和玉蜀黍。
    1950年，这支部队准备试种棉花。乌拉乌苏农场的生产顾问巴拉提老汉听到了，惊奇地说：“我种了30多年的庄稼，从没有在这一带见过棉花。”“天山以北天气冷，不能植棉。”多少年来，一直流传着这样的说法。
    玛纳斯河流域无霜期只有150天左右，夏季经常刮着干燥的西北风，昼夜之间气温相差很多；可是，夏季日照长，适于棉花生长。这里的土地有的含有盐碱，有的是重黏土；可是腐植质层相当厚。终年积雪的天山，源源不断的雪水，可以用人工控制来灌溉。以王震司令员为首的生产部队的指挥员们，曾经是陕北南泥湾开荒的老手。他们虽然没有种过棉花，但是他们信任科学，他们有着创造性的工作态度和征服自然的雄心。他们分析了一切条件，不顾各种各样反对的说法，肯定了玛纳斯河流域可以植棉。
    初次植棉，大家都很生疏。播种的时候，有的撒播，有的点播。个别连队用开水泡种，把种子烫死了。有的把种子泡出了芽，一撒到地里，便枯萎了。播种的时间，前后相差十多天；东边的田里已经出了苗，西边的田里，刚开始播种。更谈不上密植、整枝和中耕、施肥了。秋收结束，每亩产籽棉只有二、三十斤。
    产量虽然低，巴拉提老汉却在这个地方初次见到了棉花。
    每亩400斤
    1952年冬天，苏联专家提托夫到了新疆。王震同志虚心地向他请教，提出了在玛纳斯河流域创造两万亩棉花平均每亩产籽棉400斤的丰产要求。
    农场和连队的某些指挥员听到1953年棉花的计划产量，大吃一惊，感到从每亩平均二、三十斤突然跳到400斤，无疑地是“冒进”了。
    有的战士俏皮地说：“就是加上棉秆，也达不到400斤。”
    提托夫却说：“只要认真学习先进经验，保证能达到400斤。”
    生产建设部队的党委坚决执行了新疆军区的计划和提托夫的技术措施，司令员陶峙岳也亲自到各农场动员和检查。
    当春风解冻的时候，两万亩棉田的丰产运动开始了。
    是怎样做到的
    要使棉花的产量达到每亩400斤，做起来的确不容易。
    今天，人们走进玛纳斯河流域的每座农场，总可以看到那干燥的消过毒的房子里，放着一袋袋的棉籽。这些棉籽都是战士们一粒一粒选出来的。然而，1953年播种前的情形是怎样的呢？棉籽四处乱堆，有的棉籽里混杂着向日葵和玉蜀黍的种子。当指挥部规定要粒选棉籽的时候，战士们不乐意。在泉水地农场，战士李福恩正在选棉籽，团长到连队来了。李福恩问团长：“为什么棉籽要一粒一粒地选呢？我父亲种了一辈子棉花也没有这样选过。”李福恩家住在河南洛阳，他家乡怎样植棉，他知道得很清楚。
    “你知道为什么要粒选棉籽？”团长问。
    “还不是提托夫给我们找麻烦。”
    “你到过畜牧队吗？”团长又问。
    “到过。”
    “绵羊配种，为什么要挑好的公羊？”
    “团长！不用说了，我明白了。”
    定苗的时间到了，农场指挥部规定定苗要使用定苗尺，每亩要留足7，500株。战士们听了，思想很混乱。
    “留这么稠，棉花会挤死的。”
    “留这么稠，不会结桃。”
    当连队的指挥员在田间的时候，战士们便使用定苗尺；指挥员一走开，定苗尺就被丢在一边了。乌拉乌苏农场三连连长看到战士侯世文正在定苗，走到侯世文跟前，问他为什么不用定苗尺？
    “我的两只眼睛就是尺子，两只手也是尺子。”侯世文这样回答。
    连长检查已经定过的苗，发现苗留得太少。
    “你为什么留得这么稀？”
    “不密不稀，二千六七。我们家乡陕西岐山县草厂村的人，谁不这样留苗呢？”
    像侯世文这样的思想，在战士当中相当普遍。
    各连队通过算细账的办法教育战士们克服保守思想；战士们认识到每亩如果留苗7，000多株，每株只要结10个桃，每个桃如果重3公分，产量就可超出400斤。
    在最初一年推广先进经验中，每一项技术措施，例如中耕、施肥、沟灌、整枝等等，都是这样苦口婆心向战士们解释的。
    这年秋收的结果，两万亩棉田平均每亩产量是402斤。活生生的事实教育了玛纳斯河流域每个植棉的人。
    几年来，玛纳斯河流域的战士在植棉过程中，尝过辛酸，走过弯路，同虫害和病害，同变化无常的气候，同各种各样的保守思想，作过多少艰苦的斗争！关内植棉区的人们，你们记着他们所走过的一段路，就可以少走弯路了。
