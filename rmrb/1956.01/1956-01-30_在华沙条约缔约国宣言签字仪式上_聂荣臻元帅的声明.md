Dear Comrades,

The Prague meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States has achieved complete success. Please allow me to extend my warmest congratulations to you.

The decisions of the Prague meeting, following the Moscow and Warsaw meetings on guaranteeing European peace and security, once again demonstrate the firm determination and sincere desire of the participating countries to maintain European peace and security. They also demonstrate the complete unity of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union on issues related to international peace and security. This great unity is the fundamental guarantee for maintaining peace in Europe and the world.

The practical and feasible methods for maintaining European peace and security, pointed out by the meeting based on a correct analysis of the current international situation, not only fully conform to the interests of the people of European countries, but also fully conform to the interests of the people of all countries in the world. The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the decisions made by the Prague meeting and the proposals it has put forward are a great contribution to striving for further relaxation of the international situation and promoting the cause of world peace.

I am authorized to declare on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China that our government and people fully support the "Declaration of the Warsaw Treaty Member States" just signed and the decision made by the meeting on the issue of the German Democratic Republic's army participating in the armed forces of the Joint Command of the Warsaw Treaty Member States. We believe that the demands in the declaration regarding maintaining European peace and security at present will further mobilize and unite the peace-loving forces of Europe and the world to smash the conspiracies of the aggressive forces, thereby greatly contributing to the struggle to eliminate the threat of new wars in Asia and other regions.

    在华沙条约缔约国宣言签字仪式上
    聂荣臻元帅的声明亲爱的同志们：
    华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会布拉格会议已经获得圆满的成功，请允许我向你们致最热烈的祝贺。
    布拉格会议的各项决定，继保障欧洲和平和安全的莫斯科会议和华沙会议之后，又一次表明了会议的参加国对于维护欧洲和平和安全的坚强的决心和真诚的愿望，同时也表明了以苏联为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营在有关国际和平和安全问题上的完全的团结一致。这种伟大的团结，就是维护欧洲和世界和平的基本保证。
    会议根据对目前国际形势的正确分析而指出的维护欧洲和平和安全的各项切实可行的办法，不仅完全符合欧洲各国人民的利益，而且也完全符合世界各国人民的利益。中华人民共和国政府认为，布拉格会议所作出的决定和它所提出的主张，是对争取进一步缓和国际局势和推进世界和平事业的巨大贡献。
    我受权代表中华人民共和国政府声明：我国政府和人民完全支持刚才签署的“华沙条约缔约国宣言”和会议就德意志民主共和国军队参加华沙条约缔约国联合司令部的武装部队问题所作的决定。我们相信，宣言中关于在目前维护欧洲和平和安全的要求，必将进一步动员和团结欧洲和世界各国爱好和平的力量去粉碎侵略势力的阴谋，从而也将大大有助于在亚洲和其他地区消除新战争威胁的斗争。
