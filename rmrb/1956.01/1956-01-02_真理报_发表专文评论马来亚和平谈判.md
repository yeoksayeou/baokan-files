Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, TASS dispatch: "Pravda" published an article by Mayevsky on December 31, commenting on the Malayan negotiations regarding the cessation of military operations.

The article stated that although newspaper reports indicate that the negotiations have not yet yielded significant results, the very fact of the negotiations is gratifying to all who cherish peace and the security of all peoples. The cessation of the Malayan war and the satisfaction of the legitimate demands of the Malayan people will undoubtedly benefit the cause of consolidating peace in Southeast Asia and will have a positive impact on the overall international situation.

Mayevsky continued, stating that currently, both sides in the Hua-Leng negotiations have agreed in principle that as long as the elected government of the Federation of Malaya fully controls domestic security and the local forces currently under the control of the colonial authorities, the national liberation forces will cease armed struggle. According to reports in foreign newspapers, Rahman attempted to present a "final ultimatum" to the representatives of the Malayan Communist Party and the National Liberation Army, demanding their "surrender."

This demand was, of course, rejected by Chen Ping, who pointed out that this demand was unfounded, and that only if the participants in the national liberation movement are not persecuted and the Communist Party enjoys equal political rights with other political parties will the national liberation forces cease armed struggle.

Newspaper reports indicate that the negotiations have been temporarily suspended. However, the initial steps taken on the road to a truce in Malaya demonstrate that the issue can be resolved smoothly as long as both sides have the appropriate desire to reach a solution. At the same time, one gets the impression that certain individuals in Britain are clearly trying to stir up the flames of war in Malaya, still hoping to prolong the colonial system on Malayan soil. However, life shows that the era of colonialism is over. All peace-loving people sympathize with and support the Malayan people.

　　“真理报”发表专文评论马来亚和平谈判
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯　“真理报”在12月31日刊载了马耶夫斯基的一篇文章，评论马来亚关于停止军事行动的谈判。
    文章说，虽然据报纸消息说，谈判到现在还没有取得很大的结果，但是，谈判这个事实本身就使所有珍视和平和各国人民安全的人感到满意。马来亚战争的停止，马来亚人民的合法要求得到满足，毫无疑问将会有利于巩固东南亚和平的事业，将会对整个国际局势产生良好的影响。
    马耶夫斯基继续说，目前，华冷谈判双方原则上已经同意，只要选举产生的马来亚联合邦政府全部控制了国内安全和目前还在殖民当局掌握下的地方武力，民族解放力量就停止武装斗争。从外国报纸的消息可以看出，拉赫曼企图对马来亚共产党和民族解放军的代表提出一个类似“最后通牒”的东西，要求他们“投降”。
    这一要求当然被陈平拒绝了，他指出这个要求是没有根据的，只有民族解放运动的参加者不受迫害，共产党享有同其他政党平等的政治权利，民族解放力量才停止武装斗争。
    从报纸消息中可以看出，谈判暂时中断了，然而在马来亚停战道路上迈进的最初几步表明，只要双方都有取得解决的适当愿望，这个问题是可以顺利地解决的。同时，人们有这样一种印象，英国的某些人士显然不惜煽起马来亚的战火，仍然指望在马来亚土地上延长殖民制度。然而，生活表明，殖民主义者的时代是完结了。全体爱好和平的人民都是同情和支持马来亚人民的。
