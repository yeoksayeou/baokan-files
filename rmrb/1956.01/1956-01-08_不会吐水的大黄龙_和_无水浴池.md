　　"The Great Yellow Dragon That Doesn't Spit Water" and the "Waterless Bathhouse"
　　To the Editorial Department:
    As early as 1951, many mines under the Fushun Mining Bureau had generally adopted "insulated water delivery vehicles" and established drinking water stations to enable coal miners to drink clean hot water underground. However, the Laohutai Mine uniquely wanted to create a set of "more modern" "underground drinking water equipment"! They ran an iron pipe with a diameter of one inch and a length of more than 1,000 meters directly from the pit entrance to the horizontal roadway below, intending to pour boiling water from above, so that hot water could be obtained by opening the valve below. However, the hot water became completely cold after passing through such a long pipe, and coupled with the rust in the iron pipe, the workers could only get icy and difficult-to-swallow rusty water underground. As a result, the entire water pipe had to be dismantled after installation, wasting more than 10,800 yuan in vain.
    In April 1954, they decided to build another drinking water pipeline. This time, they supposedly "learned" from the previous "lesson" and used two-inch-diameter stainless steel pipes wrapped with chicken feather ash and white cloth for insulation, with yellow lead paint applied to the surface for corrosion prevention. However, during the test after completion, the steam pressure damaged the water pipe and the reinforcing screws, and the water tank bulged outwards, nearly causing a personal injury accident. Therefore, this underground drinking water pipeline, which cost more than 120,000 yuan to build, had to be abandoned again. The miners complained: It was a waste of so much money to build a "Great Yellow Dragon that doesn't spit water" for nothing!
    Similar things happened more than once at the Laohutai Mine. In 1954, they built a bathhouse in the Qingcaogou residential area, covering an area of 182.8 square meters. However, the organizers neither made a design drawing nor completed the water usage formalities with the water company before starting construction in a hurry. When they applied to the water company for water after completion, they found that the water source was insufficient to supply it. As a result, this bathhouse, which cost a lot of money and was intended to be used by thousands of workers and their families, became a "waterless bathhouse".
    The purpose of the Laohutai Mine in building the "Great Yellow Dragon that doesn't spit water" and the "waterless bathhouse" was to improve the workers' working and living conditions, and the intention was certainly good. Unfortunately, their hasty and reckless approach turned a good thing into a bad one!

　　“不会吐水的大黄龙”和“无水浴池”
　　编辑同志：
    早在1951年，抚顺矿务局所属的许多矿井已经普遍采用“保温送水车”和建立饮水站等方法，使采煤工人在井下能够喝到干净的热开水。但是，老虎台矿却别出心裁地要另搞一套“更近代化”的“井下饮水设备”！他们把一千多公尺一寸直径的铁管由坑口一直接到坑下的水平巷道，准备从上边灌进开水，让下边打开开关就可以喝到热水。但是，热水经过这样长的管子，流到井下已经完全冷了，再加上铁管生了锈，工人们在井下得到的只能是冰凉而难以下咽的锈水。结果，全部水管安装好以后只得拆掉，白白浪费了10，800多元。
    1954年4月，他们又决定再建一条饮水管路。这次据说是“接受”上次的“教训”，把二寸口径的白钢管作水管外面包上鸡毛灰、缠上白布来保温，表面再刷上黄铅油来防腐。但是在完工以后进行试验的时候，蒸汽压力把水管和加固螺丝压坏了，水缸也向外鼓出，险些造成人身事故。因此这条投资12万多元修起来的井下饮水管路又只好废弃。矿工们不满意地说：糟蹋了这末多的钱，白白修了一条“不会吐水的大黄龙”！
    类似的事情在老虎台矿还不止这一起。1954年他们在青草沟住宅区修建一座浴池，面积达182.8平方公尺。但是主办部门既没有做出设计图，也没有向自来水公司办理用水手续，就匆促施工。等到竣工后向自来水公司申请用水的时候，才发现水源不足，供应不了。这座花了很多钱准备供上千户职工和他们的家属使用的浴池，结果成了一座“无水浴池”。
    老虎台矿修建“不会吐水的大黄龙”和“无水浴池”的目的，是为了改善工人的劳动条件和生活条件，用心当然是好的。可惜的是，他们这种草率从事、不计工本的做法，却把好事办成了坏事！
