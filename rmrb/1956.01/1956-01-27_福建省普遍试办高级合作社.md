    Fujian Province is universally piloting advanced agricultural production cooperatives. Among the first batch of over 640 advanced cooperatives being piloted, more than 50 have already been established, and the rest will be established successively around the Spring Festival.
    The advanced cooperatives piloted in various parts of Fujian are generally based on old cooperatives with rapid production development, strong leading backbone, high cooperative member awareness, substantial public property, and a cooperative history of more than 2 years, absorbing other surrounding elementary cooperatives and individual farmers who actively request to join advanced cooperatives. According to statistics from more than 50 advanced cooperatives piloted in the Longxi Special District, these cooperatives increased production by more than 10% every year during the elementary stage. By the time they transitioned to advanced cooperatives, they had accumulated more than 122,000 yuan in public reserve funds and public welfare funds, and had also purchased 1,858 publicly owned oxen and more than 14,000 pieces of farm implements.

    福建省普遍试办高级合作社
    福建省普遍试办高级农业生产合作社，第一批试办的640多个高级社中，已经建成了50多个，其余的将在春节前后陆续建成。
    福建各地试办的高级社，一般都是以生产发展很快、领导骨干较强、社员觉悟较高、公共财产较多、办社历史在2年以上的老社为基础，吸收周围其他初级社和积极要求参加高级社的个体农民建立的。根据龙溪专区试办的50多个高级社统计，这些社在初级阶段的时候每年都增产一成以上，到了转高级社的时候，共已积累了122，000多元的公积金和公益金，另外还购置了公有耕牛1，858头、农具14，000多件。　　　（新华社）
