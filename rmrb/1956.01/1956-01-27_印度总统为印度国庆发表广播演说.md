Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 26th: Indian Republic President Prasad delivered a radio address to the nation in celebration of the sixth anniversary of the Republic's founding.

    President Prasad spoke about the progress of India's economic construction over the past six years. Regarding industrialization, he particularly mentioned that not only has production increased in already established industrial sectors, but they are also engaged in constructing more factories, especially factories producing steel. He said that the smooth implementation of the First Five-Year Plan has boosted the people's confidence in the Second Five-Year Plan. He expressed satisfaction with these advancements, while also pointing out that this is only the beginning of the task of eliminating poverty and ignorance.

    Prasad pointed out that India's foreign policy has been praised by many foreign countries as an important factor contributing to the promotion of world peace. He said that the policy of peaceful coexistence and non-involvement in war, so ably advocated by our Prime Minister, has gained more supporters in Asia and Europe this year. People should be pleased that the scope of areas adhering to the principle of peaceful coexistence has expanded to include as many countries as possible.

    In his speech, Prasad expressed regret over Portugal's "uncompromising" attitude on the Goa issue. He said that so far, all our appeals and suggestions for a peaceful resolution of the Goa issue have had no effect on the Portuguese government, and the Goan people's desire for freedom has been suppressed by force.

    普拉沙德总统谈到了六年来印度经济建设的进展情况。在工业化方面，他特别提到，不仅是在已经建立的工业部门中生产已经增加，而且在从事建设更多的工厂，特别是生产钢的工厂。他说，第一个五年计划的顺利执行鼓起了人民对第二个五年计划的信心。他对这些进展表示满意，他同时指出：这只是消除贫穷和愚昧的任务的开始。
    普拉沙德指出：印度的外交政策被许多外国赞誉为对于促进世界和平有贡献的一个重要因素。他说：我们总理所如此能干地倡导的和平共处和不卷入战争的政策，今年在亚洲和欧洲赢得了更多的拥护者，人们应当为遵守和平共处原则地区的范围扩大到把尽可能多的国家包括在内而高兴。
