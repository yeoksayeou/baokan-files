Actively Support Teachers' Scientific Research Work
Chen Wuyu, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Northwest Agricultural College Committee

Work over the past few years has proven that skillfully guiding teachers to approach Marxism through their own scientific practice is an important method that can both leverage their roles in socialist construction and help them transform their thinking. We did not clearly recognize this in the past. After the ideological remolding movement in 1952, the political consciousness and work enthusiasm of the teachers at Northwest Agricultural College generally improved. At the same time, they studied Russian and Michurin's theory, and many spontaneously engaged in scientific research. As long as we further improve the conditions for scientific research, improve the quality of teaching, and give due encouragement and support to scientific research and teaching, the enthusiasm and creativity of teachers will be fully utilized.

After the Second National Higher Agricultural and Forestry Education Conference jointly convened by the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Forestry in November 1954, we recognized the relationship between teaching reform and scientific research, and realized that teaching and scientific research can be combined. Only then did we begin to attach importance to scientific research. Subsequently, we assigned full-time cadres, established necessary systems, formulated annual scientific research plans, strengthened ties with business departments, and held the first scientific discussion meeting in January 1955. Over the years, the number of scientific research projects has been increasing. From 1950 to 1953, the total for the entire four years was 107 projects. In 1954 alone, there were 71 projects, and the number continued to increase in 1955. Most of the research topics are related to agricultural production. Recently, due to the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, many teachers have formulated new scientific research topics and plans, expressing their support for agricultural cooperativization.

Some of the research results over the years have been adopted and promoted in agricultural production. For example, the Bima No. 1 wheat variety bred by Professor Zhao Hongzhang has been promoted in several provinces, including Shaanxi and Gansu. In Shaanxi Province alone, the planting area has reached 11.38 million mu, increasing the yield per mu of wheat by about 23%. Other achievements, such as the breeding and promotion of the 6028 wheat variety, the successful method of preventing and controlling pea weevils researched jointly with the Northwest Agricultural Science Research Institute, and the high-yield technology of dryland cotton, have also played a certain role in agricultural production. Teachers have realized from practice that the Party attaches importance to scientific research and that their research results are warmly welcomed by the vast number of farmers. This has further encouraged their enthusiasm for scientific research. Professor Zhao Hongzhang was selected as a labor model in Shaanxi Province, which had a great impact on other intellectuals. Someone said, "If the mainland were not liberated, who would pay attention to Zhao Hongzhang and the Bima No. 1 wheat variety he bred!" One professor, whose ideological progress was not very fast, designed a double-entry bookkeeping method for agricultural production cooperatives. After it was tested and promoted in Yangling District, Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, he received encouragement and praise from the school. His thinking began to change, and recently he has been designing a simple and easy-to-learn abacus computer. This shows that paying attention to teachers' scientific research and helping them achieve results is one of the effective ways to unite them.

Organizing teachers to conduct scientific research is the key to improving the quality of teaching. Teachers at Northwest Agricultural College incorporated materials from experiments and research, such as high-yield cotton technology measures, Lanzhou fruit tree cultivation technology, and the method of breeding Bima No. 1 wheat, into teaching materials, which significantly improved teaching effectiveness.

The facts of the past few years also show that to deeply study the Soviet Union, understand the essence of the Soviet advanced agricultural scientific theory, and combine it with China's agricultural production reality, it is necessary to go through teachers' scientific practice. After preliminary study of Michurin's theory, some teachers conducted some experimental research, such as the tissue therapy experiment for Newcastle disease in chickens, the asexual hybridization experiment of cotton, and the mixed pollination experiment of winter melon and pumpkin. From these experimental studies, teachers realized that Soviet agricultural scientific theory is indeed advanced, thus powerfully criticizing the reactionary academic views of the bourgeoisie and promoting the in-depth study of Soviet agricultural scientific theory. Many teachers have changed from doubting Soviet agricultural scientific theory to sincerely believing in it. A deputy professor once had doubts about Michurin's theory, but after he successfully conducted an experiment using Michurin's theory, he said, "In the past, we did not understand Michurin's theory and said that Michurin's theory was incorrect; now it seems that it was because we did not understand it, not that Michurin's theory was incorrect."

In the process of conducting scientific research, teachers have more opportunities to contact reality and the masses. Practical work has made them realize that only by establishing close contact with state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and other agricultural enterprises, and conducting serious and systematic investigation work, can they correctly select research topics and obtain rich practical data. Therefore, most teachers actively seek opportunities to visit or investigate. Teachers who have participated in government water and soil conservation, forest and wasteland surveys, and cooperative construction and production planning generally report that participating in these tasks is very helpful in improving their level, enriching teaching content, and developing scientific research work. During visits and investigations, they have personally seen the grand scale of socialist construction, the high enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers for production, and the urgent need for science and technology. Their work enthusiasm and their feelings for the working people have also been enhanced. Teachers have also realized in practice that to solve major problems in agricultural production, comprehensive technical measures are necessary, and the joint cooperation of teachers from relevant teaching and research groups is required to overcome individual limitations in scientific knowledge and ensure the smooth progress of scientific research.

In short, organizing teachers to carry out scientific research in conjunction with teaching is not only important for the socialist construction cause, but also an effective way to help intellectuals conduct self-reform, improve their scientific level, and improve the quality of teaching.

The current shortcomings are: scientific research is not closely enough integrated with agricultural production, the quality is generally not high, and insufficient attention is paid to summarizing farmers' experience in high yields; academic ideological criticism work has not been systematically carried out; the necessary conditions for teachers to conduct scientific research, such as assistants, books and materials, instruments and equipment, and transportation, have not been properly resolved, and so on. This shows that conservative thinking is still seriously hindering our continued progress. In the future, we must strengthen our work in this area, further combine teaching with scientific research, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creative talents of teachers.

    积极支持教师的科学研究工作
    中共西北农学院委员会书记　陈吾愚
    几年来的工作证明：善于引导教师通过自己的科学实践接近马克思主义，是既能发挥他们在社会主义建设中的作用又能帮助他们进行思想改造的重要方法之一。这一点，我们过去认识得很不明确。1952年思想改造运动以后，西北农学院的教师的政治觉悟和工作积极性普遍提高，同时又学习了俄文和米丘林学说，很多人自发地进行科学研究。只要我们进一步改善科学研究工作的条件，提高教学质量，给予科学研究工作和教学工作以应有的鼓励和支持，教师的积极性和创造性就将得到充分的发挥。
    经过1954年11月高等教育部农业部和林业部联合召开的第二次全国高等农林教育会议，我们认识了教学改革和科学研究的关系，认识到教学和科学研究工作是可以结合进行的，这才开始对科学研究工作重视起来。随即配备了专职干部，建立了必要的制度，制定了年度科学研究计划，加强了同业务部门的联系，并且在1955年元月召开了第一次科学讨论会。几年来，科学研究项目不断增多，1950年到1953年整四年内合计是107项，1954年就有71项，1955年续有增加。大部分研究题目都是结合农业生产的。近来由于农业合作化高潮的到来，许多教师制定了新的科学研究题目和计划，表示对农业合作化的支援。
    几年来的研究成果，有的已经在农业生产中采用推广，如赵洪璋教授培育的碧蚂一号小麦良种，现已在陕甘等几个省推广，仅陕西省种植面积即达1，138万亩，使小麦每亩产量提高23％左右。其他如六○二八小麦良种的育成和推广，和西北农业科学研究所共同研究成功的豌豆象防治方法以及旱地棉花丰产技术等，也都在农业生产上起了一定的作用。教师从实践中认识到党是重视科学研究工作的，他们的研究成果是为广大农民所热烈欢迎的，这就更加鼓舞了他们从事科学研究的积极性。赵洪璋教授被选为陕西省的劳动模范，对其他知识分子发生了很大的影响。有人这样说：“大陆不解放，赵洪璋和他育成的碧蚂一号小麦良种，有谁理睬呢！”有一位教授，思想进步并不很快，他设计的农业生产合作社复式簿记，在陕西武功县阳陵区试验推广以后，得到学校的鼓励和表扬，他的思想开始有了转变，最近又在设计一种简单易学的算盘计算机。这说明：关注教师的科学研究工作，帮助他们做出成绩来，是团结他们的有效方法之一。
    组织教师进行科学研究，是提高教学质量的关键。西北农学院教师把试验研究和调查来的材料，如棉花丰产技术措施、兰州的果树栽培技术和碧蚂一号小麦选育的方法等编入教材，使教学效果显著提高。
    几年来的事实还说明，要深入学习苏联，领会苏联先进农业科学理论的精神实质并且使之同中国的农业生产实际相结合，也必须通过教师的科学实践。在初步学习了米丘林学说以后，部分教师进行了一些试验研究，如鸡新城疫组织疗法试验，棉花的无性杂交试验，冬瓜南瓜的混合授粉试验等。从这些试验研究中，教师认识到苏联农业科学理论确实是先进的，因而有力地批判了资产阶级的反动学术观点，推动了对苏联农业科学理论的深入学习。不少教师就是这样由怀疑苏联农业科学理论而变为衷心信服了。一位副教授曾对米丘林学说有怀疑，但是当他应用米丘林学说成功地做了一个试验以后，说：“过去我们不懂米丘林学说，说米丘林学说不正确；现在看起来，那是自己不懂，并不是米丘林学说不正确。”
    在进行科学研究工作的过程中，教师接触实际接触群众的机会增多了。实际工作使他们认识到只有多同国营农场、农业生产合作社以及其他农业企业单位取得密切联系，进行认真的系统的调查工作，才能正确地选定研究题目和取得丰富的实际资料。因此，一般教师都积极争取机会，出外参观或调查。参加过政府的水土保持、森林和荒地勘察、建社和生产规划等项工作的教师普遍反应：参加这些工作，对提高自己的水平，丰富教学内容和开展科学研究工作帮助很大。在参观、调查中，他们亲眼看到社会主义建设的宏大规模，广大农民生产积极性的高涨和对科学技术的迫切需要，工作热忱以及和劳动人民的感情也因此增强了。教师们在实践中还认识到要解决农业生产上的重大问题，必须有综合性的技术措施，必须要求有关教研组教师的通力合作，才有可能克服个人在科学知识上的局限性，使科学研究工作顺利进行。
    总之，组织教师结合教学开展科学研究工作，不仅对社会主义建设事业具有重要作用，而且也是帮助知识分子进行自我改造、提高科学水平和教学质量的一项有效方法。
    目前的缺点是：科学研究结合农业生产还不够紧密，质量一般也不高，对总结农民丰产经验重视不够；学术思想批判工作还没有系统地开展起来；对教师进行科学研究所必需的条件，如助手、图书资料、仪器设备、交通工具等问题还没有妥善的解决，等等。这说明保守思想还在严重地阻碍着我们继续前进。今后我们一定要加强这一方面的工作，进一步结合教学开展科学研究工作，充分地发挥教师们的积极性和创造才能。
