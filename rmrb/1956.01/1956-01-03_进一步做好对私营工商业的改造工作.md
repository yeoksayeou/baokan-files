　　Further Improve the Transformation of Private Industry and Commerce

In the past month or so, many important private industrial and retail sectors in major and medium-sized cities across the country have successively implemented full-industry public-private partnerships. As of early December 1955, according to incomplete statistics from cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Chongqing, and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, about 30 sectors in private industry, with over 2,000 factories, and over ten sectors in private retail, with over 3,000 stores, have been approved by the government to implement full-industry public-private partnerships. This shows that the speed of our country's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has greatly accelerated compared to the past.

Since the closing of the Second Meeting of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, employees and capitalists in private industry and commerce across the country have accepted socialist transformation with unparalleled enthusiasm. In Shanghai, the most concentrated area of private industry and commerce in the country, one can see large red banners reading "Celebrating the Approval of Public-Private Partnership" and dazzling golden "?". Everywhere, there are cheering squads organized by workers and capitalists. Many private factories and stores that have been approved for public-private partnership or approved to prepare for public-private partnership are decorated with lanterns and colors, holding celebration ceremonies. Workers are not only jubilant in celebrating the rebirth of their enterprises, but also transform this enthusiasm into the power to improve enterprise management as masters of their own affairs. They are dispatched in batches to state-owned factories and stores to learn advanced experiences; they actively propose abolishing various old enterprise malpractices, establishing new work and life systems; and they put forward various suggestions and guarantees for improving future work. Industrialists and businessmen across the country have further recognized the bright future of private industrialists and businessmen accepting socialist transformation, and have expressed their determination to take the socialist road. Shanghai Bao Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Store, a nationally renowned establishment, after its application for public-private partnership was approved, invested another 30,000 yuan in cash as a reserve for the public-private partnership. The capitalist of Shanghai Baida Cotton Weaving Factory sold 420 taels of gold privately stored at home to the state, investing it in enterprise production to welcome the full-industry public-private partnership. When Shanghai Pen Company was preparing for public-private partnership, it passed an agreement to first pay off taxes, clear debts, and buy public bonds before implementing full-industry public-private partnership. These progressive actions of private industrialists and businessmen will naturally be welcomed by the broad masses of people across the country. We support them in further raising their political awareness, so as to smoothly embark on the road of full-industry public-private partnership.

This new situation shows that our country's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, gradually replacing capitalist ownership with socialist ownership by the whole people, and adopting the method of peaceful transition, is completely necessary and possible. It proves that the Party's line is completely correct.

Currently, many provinces and cities have made comprehensive plans for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. It is stipulated that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, mainly in the form of full-industry public-private partnerships, will be basically completed within two years, 1956 and 1957. This is very necessary and will advance our country's capitalist industrial and commercial transformation work by a big step. However, in expanding the work of full-industry public-private partnerships, attention must be paid to the quality of work, and full preparations must be made.

Because our country's capitalist industry and commerce developed under old socio-economic conditions, its characteristic is that, regardless of the industry, the vast majority are small and medium-sized factories or stores, which are not only scattered in production and operation, but also generally have simple equipment and backward technology. According to 1954 statistics, among the more than 130,000 private factories in the country, more than 90,000 had fewer than ten employees. Private commerce is even more scattered. To carry out socialist transformation of such a large number of small and medium-sized backward private enterprises and implement full-industry public-private partnerships, it is necessary to make plans industry by industry. The main content of the plan is the restructuring of production, economic restructuring, or the adjustment of the commercial network. This is a very complex and arduous task, which requires thorough investigation and research. Because the industry plan must start from the specific situation of the industry, it is necessary not only to understand the general situation of the industry, but also to understand the specific situation of each factory or store, and to grasp the necessary information in order to propose practical and feasible transformation plans. On the basis of strengthening leadership, full-industry public-private partnerships should be carried out in stages and batches in a planned and step-by-step manner. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen publicity and education, especially to strengthen the education of capitalists, so that they can dispel their concerns and correct their attitudes. Within an industry, if a small number of capitalists have not yet fully considered and are unwilling to participate in the partnership, it is also possible to first implement the partnership with the majority of business owners, and let the capitalists who are temporarily unwilling to participate take another look and wait a little longer. From the current situation, the vast majority of capitalists are willing to accept full-industry public-private partnerships, which is a favorable aspect of our transformation of capitalist industry and commerce; but it should also be seen that, on the other hand, there are still some capitalists in some areas who have a unclear understanding of full-industry public-private partnerships, and thus have engaged in illegal activities such as inserting private individuals, raising salaries, and withdrawing funds before the partnership. This should attract the attention of Party and government leading organs and all employees of private enterprises in various regions, and continue to strengthen publicity and education to the industrial and commercial circles, clarify their confused thoughts, and prevent and correct their illegal behaviors.

In merging factories or stores, full attention must be paid to the production and operation characteristics of each enterprise, and it must be carried out under leadership and in a planned manner. Production and operation varieties should not be reduced, or the quality of production and operation should not be lowered, due to the merger of factories and stores, especially some more scattered products that are customarily used and liked by the people. The production of these should not be neglected simply because it is not a major product. When adjusting the commercial network, more attention should be paid to not affecting the convenience of consumers' purchases. Some factories may be small in scale, but their products are special, so it is not necessary to carry out consolidation; some stores may be scattered, but they are convenient for residents to purchase, so the needs of supply must be taken care of. In short, mergers and reorganizations cannot unilaterally emphasize concentration, and should not be based on conditions, but should be comprehensively and realistically considered according to the needs of developing production and commodity circulation. Recently, some areas have experienced the phenomenon of some industrialists and businessmen blindly merging factories and stores on their own, which will inevitably cause confusion in production and operation and should be quickly corrected. In addition, although full-industry public-private partnership has become the main form of transforming capitalist industry and commerce at present, processing orders and distribution on commission still account for a considerable proportion. Therefore, in the process of expanding full-industry public-private partnership, it is also necessary to pay attention to strengthening the leadership of processing orders and distribution on commission, maintain the normal order of production and operation, and avoid the occurrence of confusion and stagnation in production and operation phenomena.

Under the new situation of rapid development of socialist construction and socialist transformation, private industrialists and businessmen across the country should earnestly strengthen their studies, see the bright future of our great motherland, actively do a good job in current production and operation, adhere to a patriotic and law-abiding stance, and contribute their strength to the socialist construction cause of the motherland.

### 进一步做好对私营工商业的改造工作

　　进一步做好对私营工商业的改造工作
    最近一个多月以来，全国各大、中城市有很多重要的私营工业和零售商行业，都陆续地实行了全行业的公私合营。到1955年12月上旬为止，仅据上海、天津、北京、武汉、广州和重庆等城市和江苏、浙江、安徽三省的不完全统计，私营工业中约有30多个行业、约二千多个工厂，私营零售商业中约有十多个行业，三千多家商店，已经政府批准实行了全行业公私合营。这说明我国对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的速度，比以前大大加快了。
    从中华全国工商业联合会执行委员会第二次会议闭幕以来，全国各地私营工商业中的职工和资本家，都以无比的热情接受社会主义改造。在全国私营工商业最集中的上海，到处可以看到“庆祝批准公私合营”的大红横幅和耀眼的金黄“?”字。到处是工人和资本家们组织的报喜队。许多被批准公私合营、或者被批准筹备公私合营的私营工厂和商店，都张灯结彩，举行庆祝仪式。工人们不仅欢欣鼓舞庆祝企业的新生，而且以主人翁的姿态把这种热情变为改善企业经营管理的力量。他们一批批出发到国营工厂、商店去学习先进经验；他们主动提出取消旧企业的各种陋规，订立新的工作、生活制度；并且提出各种改进今后工作的建议和保证。全国各地工商业者进一步认清了私营工商业者接受社会主义改造的光明前途，纷纷表现了走社会主义道路的决心。全国著名的上海宝大祥绸布庄，在申请公私合营被批准以后，资方又投入现款三万元作为公私合营的准备金。上海私营百达棉织厂的资方，把家中私藏的420两黄金卖给国家，投入企业生产，迎接全行业公私合营。上海制笔公司在筹备公私合营的时候，通过了先交清税款、还清债务、买好公债以后再实行全行业公私合营的协议。私营工商业者这种进步的行动，自然会受到全国广大人民的欢迎。我们赞助他们进一步提高他们的政治觉悟，以便顺畅地走上全行业公私合营的道路。
    这一新的形势表明我国对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造、逐步地用社会主义的全民所有制来代替资本主义所有制，采用和平过渡的办法，是完全必要的和可能的。它证明了党的路线是完全正确的。
    目前，已有很多省、市做出了对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的全面规划。规定在1956年和1957年两年以内，基本上完成对资本主义工商业以全行业公私合营为主要形式的社会主义改造。这是十分必要的，它将使我国的资本主义工商业改造工作向前推进一大步。但是，在扩展全行业公私合营的工作中，必须注意工作的质量，充分做好准备。
    由于我国的资本主义工商业是在旧的社会经济条件下发展起来的，它的特点是不论那一个行业，其中绝大多数是中小型的工厂或商店，它们不仅在生产和经营上是分散的，而且一般设备简陋、技术落后。根据1954年的统计，全国13万多家私营工厂中，职工不足十人的就有九万多家。私营商业更是零星分散。对这样一些为数众多的中小型的落后的私营企业进行社会主义改造，实行全行业公私合营，必须逐行逐业做好规划。规划的主要内容，就是关于生产改组、经济改组或调整商业网。这是一件十分复杂而艰巨的工作，这就必须做好调查研究工作。因为行业的规划必须从行业的具体情况出发，不仅要了解行业总的情况，而且要了解每个工厂或商店的具体情况，掌握必要的资料，才能提出切实可行的改造方案。在加强领导的基础上，有步骤有计划地分期分批地进行全行业公私合营。同时，要加强宣传教育工作，特别是要加强对资本家的教育，使他们解除顾虑，端正态度。在一个行业之中，如果有少数资本家还没有考虑成熟，不愿意合营，也可以先对大部分业户实行合营，让暂时还不愿合营的资本家再看一看，再等一等。从目前的情况来看，绝大多数的资本家是愿意接受全行业公私合营的，这是我们改造资本主义工商业的有利的一方面；但也应该看到另一方面，这就是目前有些地区还有一些资本家由于对全行业公私合营的认识不清，因而也发生了趁合营前安插私人、提高薪资、抽逃资金等违法行为。这就应该引起各地党政领导机关和私营企业全体职工的注意，继续加强对工商界的宣传教育，澄清他们的混乱思想，防止和纠正他们的不法行为。
    在并厂或并店中，必须充分注意到各企业生产和经营的特点，有领导有计划地进行。不能因并厂并店而减少生产和经营的品种，或降低了生产和经营的质量，特别是一些比较零星但为人民所习惯乐用的产品，不能因为它不是主要产品就不注意生产。在调整商业网的时候，更要注意不影响到消费者购买的便利。有些工厂规模虽小，但产品特殊，就可以不必进行合并集中；有些商店虽然零星分散，但便于居民购买，就必须照顾到供应的需要。总之，合并、改组不能片面地强调集中，不能不根据条件，而应该全面地实事求是地根据发展生产和商品流转的需要来考虑。近来有些地区发生了某些工商业者盲目自行并厂并店的现象，这必然会造成生产和经营上的混乱，应该迅速加以纠正。此外，全行业公私合营虽然已成为目前改造资本主义工商业的主要形式，但是，加工订货和经销代销仍然占了相当的比重，因此，在扩展全行业公私合营的过程中，也必须注意加强对加工订货和经销代销工作的领导，保持生产和经营秩序的正常，避免发生生产和经营的混乱和停顿的现象。
    在社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业迅速发展的新形势下，全国私营工商业者应该认真加强学习，看清我们伟大祖国的光明前途，积极地搞好当前的生产和经营，坚持爱国守法的立场，为祖国的社会主义建设事业贡献自己的力量。
