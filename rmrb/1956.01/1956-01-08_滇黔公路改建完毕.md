The reconstruction of the Yunnan-Guizhou Highway was completed at the end of last year. After the reconstruction, the driving distance of the highway was shortened by more than 17 kilometers. 150 sharp bends and steep slopes, including the famous "Twenty-Four Turns", have been straightened and leveled. From then on, this highway, which starts from Guiyang in the east and ends in Zhanyi, Yunnan in the west, not only ensures driving safety and allows heavy-duty vehicles to pass smoothly, but also saves the country 3.2 million yuan in freight costs every year and increases transportation turnover by 20%.

    滇黔公路改建完毕
    滇黔公路已经在去年年底改建完毕。改建以后，公路的行车里程缩短了17公里多。有150处急弯陡坡，包括著名的“二十四拐”，都已改直改平。从此，这条公路东起贵阳西到云南沾益，不仅保证行车安全，载重车辆能畅通无阻；并且每年可以为国家节约320万元运费，提高运输周转率20％。
