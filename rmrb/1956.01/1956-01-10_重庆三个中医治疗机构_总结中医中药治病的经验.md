　　Chongqing's Three Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment Institutions
    Summarize Experiences in Treating Diseases with Traditional Chinese Medicine
    Last year, Chongqing's First Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Second Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, and the Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic of the Chongqing Municipal Health Bureau summarized 21 experiences in treating diseases with traditional Chinese medicine. Clinical experiments have proven that these experiences have significant curative effects. The cure rate of more than 1,000 patients hospitalized in these three traditional Chinese medicine treatment institutions last year reached 82.8%.
    Last year, these three traditional Chinese medicine treatment institutions used the traditional Chinese medicine compound "Yan Gui San" combined with massage, guidance, and other physical therapies to treat joint tuberculosis, acute and chronic osteomyelitis, joint stiffness, as well as fractures, bone spurs, and other diseases. The condition of 96% of the patients improved or recovered within an average of two to three months. The cure rate of using Chinese medicine Kushen tablets to expel roundworms reached over 90%.
　　These three units also summarized experiences in treating common diseases with traditional Chinese medicine. Among them, acute enteritis, children's pertussis, and acute and chronic bronchitis are ten diseases with relatively good curative effects. The use of traditional Chinese medicine compounds such as Coptis chinensis, Scutellaria baicalensis, Lonicera japonica, and Scrophularia ningpoensis to treat dysentery, scarlet fever, lobar pneumonia, and other infectious diseases also has good results and no side effects, and can replace antibiotic drugs.

    总结中医中药治病的经验
    重庆市第一中医院、第二中医院和重庆市卫生局中医门诊部去年又总结出21种中医中药治疗疾病的经验，这些经验经过临床实验证明都有显著疗效。这三个中医治疗机构去年住院的一千多个病人的治愈率达到82.8％。
    这三个中医治疗机构去年用中药复方“延桂散”配合按摩、导引等物理疗法治疗关节结核和急性、慢性骨髓炎，关节僵硬，以及骨折、骨刺等多种疾病，有96％的病人平均在两三个月内病情就好转或痊愈了。用中药苦楝片驱蛔虫的治愈率达到90％以上。
　　这三个单位还总结出中医中药治疗多发病的经验。其中疗效较好的有急性肠炎、小儿顿咳和急性、慢性支气管炎等十种疾病。用中药黄连、黄芩、银花、玄参等复方治疗痢疾、猩红热和大叶肺炎等多种传染病，效果也很好，并且没有副作用，可以代替抗生素类药物。
