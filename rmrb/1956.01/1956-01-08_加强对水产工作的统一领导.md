　　Strengthen Unified Leadership Over Aquatic Work
　　Yao Huibin, Deputy Director of the First Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce
    Starting in December 1955, according to the State Council's instructions, the production, processing, transportation, and sales enterprises of aquatic products were placed under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Commerce. This measure is timely and necessary. It will play an important role in increasing aquatic product production and improving processing, transportation, and sales work.
    Our country has vast marine fishing grounds and coastal mudflat aquaculture areas, as well as extensive inland freshwater aquaculture and fishing areas, with abundant aquatic resources and great production potential. The planned output for 1955 more than doubled that of 1950, and the planned output of aquatic products for 1957 will reach 2,807,000 tons, an increase of 68.5% compared to 1952.
    In recent years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the national aquatic work has achieved great success. Immediately after liberation, a democratic reform movement was carried out in the fishing areas, eliminating feudal exploitation in the production, transportation, and sale of aquatic products. On the coastal defense front, fishermen were led to strengthen the struggle against the enemy, ensuring safe production. Socialist transformation was carried out in fisheries production, and economic assistance and technical guidance were provided to fishermen, resulting in significant development of fisheries production cooperatives and further improvement in fishermen's production volume. State-owned aquatic enterprises have also developed greatly, with the construction of more fishing vessels, the addition of refrigeration and ice-making equipment, and the establishment of by-product factories for fish liver oil, fish meal, etc. State-owned aquatic product transportation and sales organizations have been established and gradually expanded their operating share. In addition, many storm warning stations and fishery navigation lighthouses have been established; fishery technology extension stations and production guidance ships have been added; and aquatic science and technology research has been carried out, training aquatic professional personnel. However, in recent years, the production, processing, transportation, and sales operations of aquatic products have lacked unified planning and arrangements. Due to decentralized leadership in various regions, state-owned aquatic enterprises have faced some problems in tapping production potential, dispatching ships, allocating personnel, and establishing fishing ports. The transportation and sales of aquatic products are the responsibility of several departments, with plans not linked and production and sales not closely integrated. In addition, aquatic products are fresh and perishable, transportation is inconvenient, and refrigeration equipment conditions are poor, resulting in imbalances between production and sales and unstable market prices. In the future, the production and sales of aquatic products must be closely integrated and unified leadership, unified management, and operations must be implemented. Therefore, the State Council's decision to place aquatic product production, processing, transportation, and sales enterprises under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Commerce is very necessary. Especially in the coming period, when the supply of certain non-staple foods is insufficient, striving to develop the production of aquatic products and strengthening the transportation and sales operations of aquatic products is of great significance for ensuring the supply of cities and industrial and mining areas.
    The guiding principle for future aquatic work is: tap production potential, produce more and sell more. Local commercial departments, under the leadership of the local Party committees and government departments, should actively promote the fisheries production cooperative movement, gradually expand state-owned aquatic enterprises, and improve output and quality; they should expand transportation and sales operations, increase the supply of fresh aquatic products, meet the needs of the people in cities and industrial and mining areas for aquatic products, supply more aquatic products as industrial raw materials and organize exports, and at the same time strengthen the socialist transformation of private fishmongers and fish vendors.
    The production task for aquatic products in 1956 is arduous, but due to the development of the fisheries cooperativization movement, the further improvement of fishermen's production enthusiasm, and the efforts of state-owned aquatic enterprises to improve management, the production task can be completed and even exceeded. The key to increasing fisheries production lies in vigorously carrying out the fisheries cooperativization movement, carrying out the establishment and consolidation of fisheries production cooperatives, helping fisheries production cooperatives establish various systems, and strengthening economic assistance and technical guidance to fishermen. Implement year-round operations combining various tools according to specific conditions, and increase safety production equipment. State-owned marine production enterprises must make full use of existing equipment, tap potential, increase the number of voyages and hauls of fishing vessels, and strive to improve unit output and quality. In terms of freshwater aquatic production, state-owned enterprises should vigorously cultivate fish fry, improve the feeding and management of fish fry, increase the yield of already stocked freshwater areas, and gradually expand the aquaculture area. In order to better develop production, it is also necessary to actively implement the breeding and protection policy, and pay attention to helping solve the livelihood problems of poor fishermen. In addition, it is necessary to further strengthen the political and ideological education of coastal fishermen and state-owned aquatic enterprise employees, improve fishermen's political vigilance, and lead fishermen to carry out the struggle against the enemy, in order to ensure safe production and consolidate coastal defense.
    To do a good job in the supply and marketing of aquatic products, relevant departments should formulate next year's supply and marketing plan for aquatic products according to the production volume and consumption growth rate of aquatic products, and according to the spirit of gradually expanding the operation of aquatic products. When carrying out the transportation and sales of aquatic products, the first thing to do is to ensure the supply of aquatic products to cities and industrial and mining areas, especially to increase the supply of fresh aquatic products, so as to stabilize the supply of non-staple foods in the market and meet the needs of consumers. It is necessary to vigorously improve operation and management, and gradually achieve that fish, shrimp, shellfish, and algae do not smell or rot. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the procurement of aquatic products. The products produced by state-owned aquatic enterprises, except for a part used for self-processing, are all purchased by state-owned aquatic product supply and marketing departments through contracts. The products of fisheries production cooperatives and individual fishermen should also be purchased through contracts. In addition, in order to develop aquatic production and expand the circulation of aquatic products, fishermen should also be allowed and actively organized to produce and sell their own products. Thirdly, market management should be carried out through the organization of the purchase and sale of aquatic products, so that the prices of aquatic products gradually tend to be reasonable. It is necessary to strengthen investigation and research work, and gradually unify the price management of aquatic products. There should be reasonable regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences, and certain seasonal price differences and quality price differences should be formulated according to the production season, sales situation, and variety of aquatic products. Salted dried fish should be improved in quality as much as possible, reduce costs, and master reasonable sales prices to expand sales. Fourth, according to the overall plan for the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, carry out the socialist transformation of private fishmongers and fish vendors. At present, it is necessary to understand the operating conditions of private fishmongers and fish vendors, strengthen the leadership and organization of private fishmongers and fish vendors, so as to make good use of them to expand the supply of aquatic products, and carry out socialist transformation through organized sales. Fifth, do a good job in the supply of production and living materials for fishermen. The general production and living materials needed by fishermen are basically supplied by the local state-owned specialized companies and supply and marketing cooperatives that operate these commodities, but the special and large quantities of commodities necessary for fishermen to engage in production, as well as materials that are uniformly controlled and supplied by the state and imported, should be uniformly organized and supplied by the state-owned aquatic product supply and marketing departments to ensure the source of goods and support production.
    In order to better complete the production and supply and marketing tasks of aquatic products in 1956, in addition to correspondingly increasing the necessary capital construction investments such as fishing vessels, ice-making plants, cold storage, refrigerated vehicles, and refrigerated transport ships, it is also necessary to establish and strengthen corresponding organizational structures. In the future, it is hoped that the Party committees in various places will strengthen their leadership over aquatic work, and that all aquatic workers will work diligently and tirelessly, with a hundredfold effort, in order to further develop aquatic production and meet the people's growing needs for aquatic products.

　　加强对水产工作的统一领导
    商业部第一局副局长　姚会宾
    从1955年12月份开始，根据国务院的指示，把水产的生产、加工、运销企业划归商业部统一领导，这一措施是适时的和必要的。这对增加水产品生产、改进加工、运销工作将起重要的作用。
    我国有广大的海洋渔场和沿海滩涂养殖场，内陆淡水养殖、捕捞面积也很广，水产资源丰富，生产潜力很大。1955年的计划产量比1950年增加一倍半以上，1957年水产品计划产量将达到2，807，000吨，比1952年增加68.5％。
    几年来，在党和政府的领导下，全国水产工作取得了很大的成绩。解放以后，立即进行了渔区的民主改革运动，消灭了在水产品生产运销上的封建剥削。在海防前线，领导渔民加强对敌斗争，保证了安全生产。对渔业生产进行了社会主义改造，对渔民进行了经济上的援助和技术指导，使渔业生产合作社有很大的发展，渔民的生产量有进一步提高。国营水产企业也有了很大发展，增建了渔轮，增设了一些冷藏、制冰设备和鱼肝油、鱼粉等附属工厂，建立了国营水产运销机构，并且逐步扩大了经营比重。此外，还建立了暴风警报站和渔业航标灯塔多处；增设了渔业技术推广站和生产指导船；进行水产科学技术研究工作，培养了水产专业工作人员。但是，几年来水产品的生产、加工、运销经营还缺乏统一的规划和安排，国营水产企业由于各地分散领导，在发挥生产潜力、调度船只、人员调配、筹设渔港等方面都有若干问题。水产品的运销是由几个部门负责，计划不衔接，产销也不能密切结合，加之水产是鲜活商品，运输不便，冷藏设备条件较差，造成产销不平衡，市场价格不稳定。今后，水产品的产销必须密切结合，实行统一领导，统一管理和经营。因此，国务院决定把水产生产、加工、运销企业划归商业部统一领导是十分必要的。特别是在今后相当长的一个时期内，在某些副食品供不应求的情况下，努力发展水产品的生产，加强水产品的运销经营，对保证城市、工矿区的供应，有很重要的意义。
    今后水产工作的方针是：发掘生产潜力，多产多销。各地商业部门要在当地党委和政府部门的领导下，积极推动渔业生产合作运动，逐步扩大国营水产企业，提高产量和质量；要扩大运销经营，增加鲜活水产品的供应，满足城市、工矿区人民对水产品的需要，供应更多的水产品作为工业原料和组织出口，同时要加强对私营鱼商鱼贩的社会主义改造。
    1956年水产品的生产任务是繁重的，但是由于渔业合作化运动的发展，渔民生产积极性的进一步提高和国营水产企业努力改善经营管理，生产任务是可以完成和争取超额完成的。渔业增产的关键在于大力开展渔业合作化运动，进行渔业生产合作社的建社整社工作，帮助渔业生产合作社建立各项制度，加强对渔民的经济援助和技术指导。根据具体条件推行多种工具结合的常年作业，增建安全生产设备。国营海洋生产企业必须充分利用现有设备，发掘潜力，增加渔轮出海的航次、网次，努力提高单位产量和质量。在淡水水产生产方面，国营企业应该大力培养鱼苗，改善鱼苗的饲养管理工作，提高已经放养的淡水面积的产量，并且逐步扩大养殖面积。为了更好地发展生产，还必须积极贯彻执行繁殖保护政策，并且注意帮助解决贫苦渔民的生活问题。此外，要进一步加强对沿海渔民和国营水产企业职工的政治思想教育，提高渔民的政治警惕性，领导渔民进行对敌斗争，以保证安全生产和巩固海防。
    要作好水产品的供销工作，有关部门应该根据水产品的生产量和消费量的增长速度，根据逐步扩大水产品经营的精神，制定明年水产品的供销计划。在进行水产品的运销工作的时候，首先要保证做好城市、工矿区的水产品供应工作，特别要增加鲜活水产品的供应，以稳定市场副食品的供应，满足消费者的需求。要大力改善经营管理，逐步作到鱼、虾、贝、藻，不臭不烂。其次要加强水产品的收购工作，国营水产企业生产的产品，除自用加工的一部分外，其余都通过合同形式由国营水产供销部门全部收购。对渔业生产合作社和个体渔民的产品，也应该通过合同形式来收购。此外，为了发展水产生产，为了扩大水产品商品的流通，还应该允许和积极组织渔民自产自销。第三，要通过组织水产品的购销工作进行市场管理，使水产品的价格逐步趋向合理，要加强调查研究工作，逐步统一水产品的价格管理。要有合理的地区差价和批发零售差价，并且要根据水产的生产季节、销售情况和品种情况，制定一定的季节差价和品质差价。咸干鱼应该尽量提高质量，降低成本，掌握合理的销售价格，以扩大推销。第四，根据改造资本主义工商业的全面规划，进行对私营鱼商鱼贩的社会主义改造。目前需要了解清楚私营鱼商鱼贩的经营情况，加强对私营鱼商鱼贩的领导和组织工作，以便很好的利用他们来扩大水产品的供应，并且通过组织推销，对他们进行社会主义改造。第五，要做好渔民生产生活资料的供应工作。渔民需要的一般生产生活资料，基本上由当地经营这些商品的国营专业公司和供销合作社负责供应，但是对渔民从事生产所必需的特殊的大量的商品和属于国家统一掌握供应的以及进口的物资，应该统一由国营水产供销部门负责组织供应，以保证货源，支持生产。
    为了很好地完成1956年水产品的生产和供销任务，除了相应地增加渔轮、制冰厂、冷藏库以及冷藏汽车、冷藏运输船只等必要的基本建设投资外，还必须建立和加强相应的组织机构。今后，希望各地党委加强对水产工作的领导，全体水产工作人员兢兢业业，勤劳不懈，百倍努力地进行工作，以进一步发展水产生产，满足人民对水产品日益增长的需要。
