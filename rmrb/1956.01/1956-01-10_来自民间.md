	From the Folk
　　——After Seeing the Romanian Folk Art Exhibition——
    Zhang Ding
    On December 30, 1955, the eighth anniversary of the founding of the Romanian People's Republic, the Romanian People's Republic Association for Foreign Culture inaugurated a rich exhibition in Beijing composed of more than 1,200 folk art items. This exhibition, through various crafts, centrally and systematically reflects the living conditions, thoughts and feelings, tastes and preferences of the Romanian people, enabling the people of China and Romania to further understand each other, and also provides the Chinese art circles with experience in folk art work.
    The folk art items exhibited come from representative states of Romania and include many categories. A detailed introduction is difficult. I only want to talk about Romanian folk architecture, pottery and clothing, and involve some issues in our work in this area.
    Romanian folk architecture, according to the lifestyles of the past generations, especially the rural people, their occupations and economic conditions, adapts to local conditions and uses local materials to create different construction methods and different architectural styles. For example, in the mountains and pine forests, there are black pointed roofs built of wheat straw or wooden strips for herdsmen and lumberjacks; on the Black Sea coast, fishermen use golden reeds to build neat triangular houses; in the folk houses of Oltenia on the banks of the Danube, wood carvings are famous, with tall roof eaves resting on the main beams supported by carved columns, and on the roof ridges, you can see various animals carved from oak, and flower borders with sky blue as the base, constituting the characteristics of local architectural art. These beautiful and diverse folk architectures have a significant impact on Romania's new architectural art, especially in civil architecture. However, when our architectural circles mention accepting national heritage, they are often limited to classical palace architecture, and research on folk architecture has not yet begun. For example, many exquisite Ming Dynasty residences in Dongting Mountain in Jiangsu, ordinary farmhouses in Jiaxing area of Zhejiang, brick houses in cave dwellings in Shanxi, architectural carvings in Chaozhou area of Guangdong... both in terms of use and art, should have important reference value for the development of our new architectural art.
    Our ceramic art has a glorious historical tradition and is famous all over the world. However, so far, whether it is people who study, introduce or collect ceramics, they are still limited to the works of classical official kilns, and have not paid enough attention to ancient and modern folk ceramics, especially folk pottery, and sometimes even express contempt. In museums, except for painted pottery from the primitive era, the so-called "pottery" and "porcelain" are disproportionate. Even in the national ceramics exhibition held last year, the proportion of pottery was very small, occupying a very unimportant position in the display. In the craft or commodity exhibitions held abroad over the years, folk ceramics have not been well introduced. Although this problem has various complex reasons, it is always a defect in our art work that cannot be ignored. For folk pottery in various places, arts and crafts artists need to conduct in-depth research to improve and develop it.
    Romania's work in ceramics is very worthy of our study. In the exhibition, in addition to displaying various forms of folk ceramics from various regions, there are also processing creations by artists. The cooperation between artists and craftsmen is very good. Pottery occupies a very important position in the lives of Romanian farmers. Each state has a pottery production center, and each center produces different forms and decorations of pottery, and can meet the requirements and preferences of the local people. The colors are mostly red, yellow, dark brown, green and white. The black pottery painted with natural patterns in Suceava State has a unique flavor; and the types of pottery are really numerous, such as soup plates, vegetable plates, various sizes of jars, pots, flower pots, stew pots, pans, candlesticks, as well as irons, toys, statues, etc., which are really too numerous to mention. Romanian pottery has its own glorious and long tradition. For example, Cucuteni pottery was already famous for its beautiful form and gorgeous colors in the Neolithic Age. In addition, Romanian pottery also absorbed the strengths of Greek, Roman and Oriental pottery, and gradually formed its unique unified style. After liberation, this tradition has been further developed, as vividly illustrated by the many new creations of artists such as Vasilescu exhibited.
    The clothing of the people in each state of Romania also has different characteristics, but overall, we can still see the common style of Romanian national costumes. Whether it is the clothing of herdsmen, farmers, workers, or fishermen, whether it is felt coats, cloth shirts, or leather vests, most of them use white as the base color, and are embroidered or woven with various colorful wool, cotton thread, and leather strips into various bright patterns. The proportion of width and narrowness and the position occupied are very appropriate, which not only expresses the lines of the human body and tailoring, but also highlights the exquisite patterns, which conforms to the principles of aesthetics. Red, black, blue, green and chestnut are common basic colors in Romanian clothing patterns, and even contrasting colors are used very harmoniously. At present, whether it is daily wear or stage costumes in our country, there are still many problems waiting to be solved. Except for the costumes of Peking Opera, which still retain some of the advantages of Ming Dynasty clothing styles and have been highly developed in art, there are still many problems with the costumes of modern opera and dance. Drawing essence from folk costumes is also very necessary for us today. Our country is a multi-ethnic country. Even the Han nationality has undergone great changes in clothing in the past 100 years, but in various regions, research materials with rich local characteristics can still be excavated, and the clothing of various ethnic minorities is even richer. This work urgently needs arts and crafts artists, stage artists, folklorists to start as soon as possible.
    When Romanian friends introduce their folk art, they first mentioned that the ancient cultural relics with a high artistic level displayed in their museums and exhibitions are not the whole picture of Romanian people's art. To this day, the Romanian people are still constantly creating vibrant works of art. Yes, the whole picture of the people's art of any country should include the classical and the folk. The inheritance relationship of the excellent national tradition is also in two aspects. Missing any one aspect is a serious defect. All art can only develop forward on this basis, improve and create, and appropriately absorb foreign progressive factors. Romanian artists have given us a good example in this regard, especially the creation of handicrafts for people's daily life. At a glance, it is "from the folk" and has been processed and created by experts. In order to better develop our country's folk art to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people, our artists should learn a lot from here.

    来自民间
　　——看过罗马尼亚民间艺术展览会以后——
    张仃
    1955年12月30日，罗马尼亚人民共和国建国八周年纪念日，罗马尼亚人民共和国对外文化协会，以1，200多件民间艺术品所组成的、内容丰富的展览会，在北京揭幕。这次展览，通过各种工艺品，集中地和系统地反映了罗马尼亚人民的生活情况、思想感情、趣味和爱好，使中罗两国人民进一步互相了解，同时也为中国美术界提供了有关民间艺术工作方面的经验。
    展览会展出的民间艺术品，来自罗马尼亚有代表性的各州，并包括很多种类，详细的介绍是有困难的，我只想谈谈罗马尼亚的民间建筑、陶器和服装，并涉及我们在这方面工作上的一些问题。
    罗马尼亚的民间建筑，根据历代的、特别是农村人民的生活方式，人们的职业和经济条件，因地制宜，就地取材，创造了不同的营造方式和不同的建筑式样。例如在山岭松林间，耸立着牧人、伐木工人的用麦秸或木条筑成的黑色尖顶的屋宇；在黑海岸，渔民们用金色芦苇筑成整齐的三角形的房舍；在多瑙河畔的奥尔捷尼亚州的民房，以木雕著名，高大的屋顶前檐，架在用雕花立柱支撑着的正梁上，在屋脊的顶饰上，并可看到用橡木雕刻的各种走兽，和以天蓝色为底色的花边，构成了当地建筑艺术的特色。——这些美丽的多样的民间建筑，给予罗马尼亚新的建筑艺术尤其在民用建筑方面以重大的影响。而我国建筑界，在提到接受民族遗产的时候，往往局限于古典宫庭建筑，对于民间建筑的调查研究，还没有开始。譬如江苏洞庭山的不少精美的明代民宅，浙江嘉兴一带的普通农舍，山西窑洞式的砖房，广东潮州一带的建筑雕刻……无论在使用上和艺术上，对我国新的建筑艺术的发展，应该都有着重要的参考价值。
    我国陶瓷艺术，有着光荣的历史传统，是著名于全世界的。但是迄今为止，无论研究、介绍或收藏陶瓷的人们，也还仅限于古典官窑的作品，对于古代的、现代的民间陶瓷，尤其是民间陶器，还没有足够的重视，有时还表示轻视。在博物馆中，除了原始时代的彩陶以外，所谓“陶”“瓷”是不成比例的，即使在去年举行的全国陶瓷展览会中，陶的比重也很小，在陈列上占极不重要的位置，历年出国举行的工艺或商品展览会中，民间陶瓷，也没有作很好的介绍，这问题虽然有着各种复杂的原因，但总是我们美术工作中不容忽视的缺陷。对于各地民间陶器，需要工艺美术家深入研究，提高和发展它。
    罗马尼亚在陶瓷方面的工作，十分值得我们学习。在展览会中，除展出各地区的、各式各样的民间陶瓷器之外，还有艺术家的加工创作。艺术家和艺人合作得很好。陶器在罗马尼亚农民生活中，占有很重要的地位，每一州都有陶业生产的中心，每一个中心都生产不同形式和不同装饰的陶器，并能符合当地人民的要求和爱好，色彩大抵是红、黄、深褐，绿和白，苏契瓦州的画有本色花纹的黑陶，别具风味；而陶器的种类实在繁多，例如汤盘、菜盘、各种容量的罐子、壶、花盆、炖锅、平锅、蜡台，以及熨斗、玩具、塑像等等，真是不胜枚举。罗马尼亚陶业，有着自己的光辉悠久的传统，如库库琴陶器，在新石器时代，就已经以优美的形式和华丽的色彩而闻名了。此外，罗马尼亚陶业也吸取了希腊、罗马和东方陶器的长处，逐渐形成了它独特的统一的风格。在解放后，这个传统更加发展了，从展出的瓦西列斯库等艺术家的许多新创作中，已形象地说明了这一点。
    罗马尼亚各州人民的服装，也各有不同的特点，而总的来看，仍可以看出罗马尼亚民族服装的共同风格。无论是牧民、农民、工人、渔民的服装，也无论是毡外套、布衫、皮背心，多数是以白色作为底色，用各色毛线、棉线、皮条刺绣成或编织成各种鲜艳的花纹，宽窄比例和所占的位置，非常适度，既表现了人体和剪裁的线条，又突出了精美的图案，符合于美学的原则。红、黑、蓝、绿和栗色，是罗马尼亚服装图案常见的基本色，即使对比强烈的色彩，也运用得十分调和。我国目前无论日常穿着的服装或是舞台服装，也正有许多问题等待解决，除了京剧舞台服装，还保留着若干明代服装式样的优点，并在艺术上有高度发挥之外，现代歌剧和舞蹈的服装，问题还很多。从民间服装中，吸取精华，今天对于我们来说，也十分必要了。我国是一个多民族的国家，即使汉民族在近百年来，服装变化很大，但在各地区，仍可挖掘出富有地方特色的研究资料，而各兄弟民族的服装就更丰富了。这方面的工作是迫切需要工艺美术家、舞台美术家和民俗学家及早开始的。
    罗马尼亚的朋友们在介绍自己的民间艺术的时候，首先提到，在他们的博物馆和展览会中所陈列的具有高度艺术水平的古代文物，还不是罗马尼亚人民艺术的全貌，直到今天，罗马尼亚人民仍在不断地创造着充满活力的艺术作品。是的，任何国家人民艺术的全貌，都要包括古典的和民间的两大部分，民族优良传统的继承关系，也是两个方面的，漏掉任何一方面，都是严重的缺陷。一切艺术只有在这个基础上提高、创造，并适当地吸取外来的进步的因素，才能向前发展。罗马尼亚艺术家，在这方面的工作，给予我们很好的范例，尤其是人民日常生活工艺品的创作，一望而知，它是“来自民间”，并经过了专家的加工和创造。为了更好地发展我国的民间艺术，以满足广大人民的需要，我国的艺术家是应该从这里学习到很多东西的。
