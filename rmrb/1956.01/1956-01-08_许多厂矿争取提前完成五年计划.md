Many factories and mines in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Taiyuan, Chongqing, Kunming, Nanjing, and other places have recently proposed plans to strive to complete the tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. These factories and mines are: Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, No. 1 Automobile Accessories Factory, Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, Shanghai Boiler Factory, the jointly owned Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory, Tianjin Power Machinery Factory, Tianjin Bicycle Factory, Shenyang Water Pump Factory, Jiamusi Electric Motor Factory, Liaoyuan Mining Bureau, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, Chongqing Diesel Engine Factory, Chongqing General Machinery Factory, Qijiang Automobile Parts Factory, Kunming Machine Tool Plant, Nanjing Electrical Porcelain Factory, and Nanjing Automobile Assembly Plant, etc.

The workers and staff of these factories and mines are actively tapping potential, trying to break through old production quotas, and launching labor competitions to complete the plan ahead of schedule. One blast furnace at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has already been producing at the level of the first quarter of this year since December of last year. The lathe operator group of the three-valve workshop in the fourth workshop of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory is already doing the work for May of this year. After the Guo Shide group of the stamping and shearing workshop of the Jiamusi Electric Motor Factory improved the method of stamping silicon steel sheets in the competition, the efficiency increased by 20%. Su Tianhe, a lathe operator at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, proposed to learn from advanced experiences such as Kolesov's outer circle lathe tool to ensure that he completes 14 hours of work in 8 hours every day. Leading personnel and engineering and technical personnel of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant have also put forward nearly 20 technical and organizational measures in preparation for implementation.

    许多厂矿争取提前完成五年计划
    北京、上海、天津、沈阳、太原、重庆、昆明、南京等地最近有许多厂矿提出计划，争取提前完成第一个五年计划规定的任务。这些厂矿是：石景山钢铁厂、北京第一机床厂、第一汽车附件厂、上海电机厂、上海锅炉厂、公私合营上海华通开关厂、天津动力机器厂、天津自行车厂、沈阳水泵厂、佳木斯电机厂、辽源矿务局、太原矿山机器厂、重庆柴油机厂、重庆通用机器厂、綦江汽车配件厂、昆明机床厂、南京电瓷厂和南京汽车制配厂等。
    这些厂矿的职工正在积极挖掘潜力，设法突破旧的生产定额，开展提前完成计划的劳动竞赛。石景山钢铁厂有一座高炉从去年12月起就已经开始按照今年第一季度的生产水平进行生产。沈阳水泵厂四车间三阀工段车工一组现在已经在做今年5月份的工作。佳木斯电机厂冲剪车间郭世德小组在竞赛中改进冲压矽钢片的方法以后，提高效率20％。太原矿山机器厂车工宿天和提出要学习科列索夫外圆车刀等先进经验，保证每天8小时完成14小时的工作量。北京第一机床厂的领导人员和工程技术人员还提出了近20项技术组织措施，准备推行。
