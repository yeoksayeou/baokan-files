Comrade Deputies: This session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR is being held as 1955 draws to a close. This year has been one of significant international developments, developments that are leading to important changes in international relations.

The year drawing to a close will go down in history as a year in which the international tensions of the past period underwent a positive transformation. This transformation is largely due to the efforts of the Soviet Union. The efforts made by the Soviet Union are aimed at ensuring peace and the security of all peoples, promoting international trust, and developing broad political, economic, and cultural ties between nations, regardless of their social and political systems.

For Soviet foreign policy, 1955 has been a year of particularly active and unwavering struggle to consolidate peace, ease international tensions, and develop cooperation among peoples and nations. Today, no one can deny that the efforts made by the Soviet Union in this regard have achieved remarkable successes.

The development of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, and Afghanistan—countries that Comrade Khrushchev and I recently visited—is undoubtedly an important contribution to peace. This visit was a full manifestation of the Soviet Union's peace-loving foreign policy and a fitting end to 1955, a year that has witnessed many important international events.

The direct result of our visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan was the consolidation and expansion of the friendly and cooperative relations between the Soviet Union and these countries, and further close contact between the Soviet people and the great peoples of India, Burma, and Afghanistan. But its significance goes beyond this.

This trip is of great international importance, particularly in that it reaffirms the correctness of the fundamental Leninist principle of Soviet foreign policy—the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and political systems. This trip fully and indisputably demonstrates that this principle is a reliable foundation for strengthening peace and the security of all peoples, and for promoting international trust.

The fact is that Asian countries, home to more than half of the world's population, are today playing an increasingly important role in international life. For centuries, the peoples of many Asian countries have suffered from brutal colonial oppression, and some nations still suffer from it today. Colonialists have striven to justify their policies and their rule over Asian peoples, and still try to prove that these nations are culturally and socially backward. But one should not forget that the historical development of the Asian people began long before the European peoples appeared on the historical stage. If social and political progress in Asia has been delayed and hindered in past centuries, it is not due to the fault of the Asian peoples, but to the colonialists, who imposed a system of government in Asian countries—not only in Asia but also in Africa—based on violence, plunder, and ruthless exploitation of the inhabitants.

This system brought the colonialists immense wealth, but for the oppressed peoples of Asia and Africa, it brought poverty and immense suffering.

This situation lasted for a long time, but it could not last forever. Anyone who is even somewhat familiar with the laws of social development knows very well that a national liberation movement is bound to develop in Asian countries, and its scale is bound to grow. This is precisely what is happening. The Asian peoples have begun to awaken and stand up. Factors contributing to this great awakening are the Great October Socialist Revolution in our country and the weakening of colonial powers as a result of the First World War, and especially the Second World War.

Our great teacher, Lenin, repeatedly pointed out when speaking of Eastern countries that the masses of these countries would certainly rise up to end their unequal status and become independent builders of their own lives. Lenin often said that the time would come when billions of Asian people would become an active factor in world history and play their role in determining the destiny of all mankind. That time has now come. Today, we see the colonial system collapsing throughout Asia and the East.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the great Chinese people have embarked on the path of national regeneration and independence, and have embarked on the road to building a socialist society. This historic victory of the Chinese people has had a tremendous impact on the entire situation in Asia and the East.

This gives a new impetus to the national liberation movement of the colonial and dependent peoples.

The peoples of Great India and the peoples of Burma have shaken off the shackles of colonial rule. Inspired by the struggle for the revival and rebirth of their countries, the peoples of these countries have now entered a stage of independent economic and national development.

Indonesia and some other Eastern countries have also embarked on the path of freedom and independence.

The movement to strengthen national independence is growing in scale in the Arab countries. The African people are actively fighting for their liberation.

Comrade Deputies, Ni. Xie. Khrushchev and I spent three weeks in India. From the moment we first set foot on Indian soil until we left that hospitable land, we were constantly surrounded by an atmosphere of friendship and enthusiasm from the Indian people, who expressed their warmest and most friendly feelings towards us, and through us, warmly paid their respects to the Soviet Union. This explains why our trip to India can be described as a meeting with the great Indian people.

When we went to India, we knew it was a friendly country to us, and we could expect a warm welcome. But what we saw and heard far exceeded our expectations. When we arrived in Delhi and stepped off the plane, we were greeted by officials led by Prime Minister Nehru, and by a crowd of people as far as the eye could see. We heard the endless cheers of millions of people. The people gathered there cheered us in their own languages, which we did not understand. But we could understand that these were words of friendship and joy, and they sounded so kind and so sincere. We felt that we had arrived among true friends of the Soviet people, among our brothers.

In Delhi, about one million people came to Ramlila Square to welcome us. It was truly an unforgettable sight. The huge square was filled with a tide of surging crowds, you could hear cheers coming from all directions, and you could also see Russian slogans such as: "Indians and Russians are brothers", "Long live Indian-Soviet friendship!", "Long live world peace!", "Welcome, our dear Soviet guests!" These words of welcome came from the bottom of the hearts of the Indian people.

We proudly recognized that the warm welcome given to us by the Indian people was directed towards our glorious motherland and the great Soviet people. The Soviet people, under the leadership of their Communist Party, carried out the Great October Socialist Revolution, defeated their many foreign and domestic enemies, and steadfastly implemented the general line of our Party, thereby building the first socialist country in the world.

Through us, the Indian people expressed their heartfelt congratulations to the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, who defended their achievements in the years of the Great Patriotic War, in the arduous struggle against the fascist beasts, and are now building a new communist society with their consistent constructive efforts.

We saw that the achievements of our country, its successes and victories, were understood by the Indian people, who warmly and wholeheartedly welcomed these achievements.

It is impossible to remain unmoved when we further recall the meetings with the people of Mumbai, Coimbatore, Bangalore, Madras, Jaipur, Srinagar and other Indian cities. But the most unforgettable and vivid impression was left on us by our meeting with the people of Kolkata. Even in the days before our arrival, people from neighboring cities and villages began to flock here. Indian Prime Minister Nehru arrived in Kolkata. Newspapers later wrote that more than three million people welcomed us on the city streets. It was a lively, surging sea of people. It was here that we heard the warm words of welcome, words of friendship and love for the Soviet people. We were told that many of the participants in the Kolkata mass rally had come to the square the night before in order to secure a place close to the podium.

Friendly manifestations towards us, the representatives of the Soviet people, could be seen not only in the big cities, but also in the small villages, where men, women, old and young, all came to the road to welcome us and greet us. In these places we also heard cheers paying tribute to our country.

The meeting with the Indian parliamentarians left a deep impression on us, they welcomed us very warmly, listened to our speeches very carefully, and warmly welcomed our speeches. Indian government officials and government officials from the provinces (states) we visited warmly and attentively received us. They took a lot of care of us, making our visit to India pleasant and beneficial.

In Delhi, we were guests of Indian President Prasad. We lived in his house. Mr. Prasad tried his best to make Comrade Ni. Xie. Khrushchev and I, as well as the comrades who accompanied us, feel comfortable and at ease in his house. We had several conversations with Mr. Prasad. We handed him a letter from Comrade K.E. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Mr. Prasad expressed his deep gratitude for this letter and asked us to forward a reply to Comrade K.E. Voroshilov.

We also met with the eminent statesman, Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan, who warmly received us as Speaker of the Parliament and said many good things about the Soviet Union in his speech.

Special mention must be made of our meeting with Mr. Nehru, the outstanding statesman and Prime Minister of India. All our meetings with Prime Minister Nehru were permeated with sincere feelings of friendship. Wherever we went, we always felt his care and concern for us.

The peoples of the Union of Burma and Afghanistan, whom we later met, also expressed warm and sincere love and friendly feelings towards the Soviet people. In the cities and villages of Burma, and in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, the residents greeted us happily and cordially, that is, greeted the Soviet Union and the Soviet people.

In Delhi and other cities of India, in Yangon and Kabul, people said that the friendly and grand welcome that we, the representatives of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, received in these cities was unprecedented in these cities.

During our visit to India, we learned about many aspects of the lives of the Indian people. The Indian government gave us the opportunity to visit all parts of the country, east, south, west, and north. During the visit, we flew a total of 22,500 kilometers on our Soviet "Il-14" aircraft designed by Xie. Fu. Ilyushin, of which about 10,000 kilometers were flown in India alone.

We visited various regions of India, many cities, villages, construction projects and industrial enterprises, some state-owned farms, and many cultural institutions, and visited famous monuments of ancient and rich Indian culture.

British colonialists ruled India for almost two centuries. For the British colonialists, this rich country was an agricultural and raw material appendage and a sales market for industrial products of the suzerain state. Naturally, Britain did not devote itself to developing Indian industry. All colonialists do this, because their purpose is to extract as much profit as possible from the colony, and give little or nothing to the colony.

The Indian people, having freed themselves from the oppression of the colonialists, restored the independence of their country, and under the leadership of their own government, have begun to develop their national economy. Initial achievements have been made on this road. We visited and learned about the main industrial zone that India has established in recent years. It is located in the Damodar River Basin at the junction of Bihar Province and West Bengal Province. This is where part of India's metallurgical, machine-building and chemical industries are distributed, and there are Indian mines and mines.

In Chittaranjan, we visited a newly built locomotive manufacturing plant. This is a state-owned enterprise that started producing locomotives in 1950. When we went there, the factory had just produced its three hundredth locomotive. Indians are proud of this factory and regard it as the vanguard of their country's machine manufacturing industry. When the engineers invited us to visit the factory, they particularly emphasized that more than 80% of the locomotive parts were produced in the factory.

We also visited a synthetic fertilizer factory in Sindri. This is also a newly built state-owned enterprise, which plays an important role in India's economy, because India's agriculture urgently needs mineral fertilizers. The city of Sindri, which has sprung up around this factory, is only four or five years old.

India is an agricultural country, with more than three-quarters of the country's population engaged in agriculture. One of the most important issues related to the development of agricultural production in India is the artificial irrigation of land. The harvest yield in non-irrigated areas is very low, and the Indian government has done a lot of work to establish large-scale irrigation systems.

We carefully learned about one of India's largest construction projects, the Bhakra-Nangal Hydropower Project, where a dam is being built and a power station is also to be built. The consideration of this huge construction project is thorough and bold, and the solution to many technical problems is worthy of attention. But the most noteworthy thing we saw here was the great labor enthusiasm of the workers and engineers building this project. The Bhakra-Nangal construction project reminds us of the situation during our first five-year plan, when we built our first batch of large enterprises.

The Indian government is looking for ways to develop agricultural production within the scope of private land ownership. To this end, the Indian government has taken many measures in rural areas, such as the "Village Development Plan" and the "National Development Promotion Plan". We were told that these plans are currently being implemented in about 20% of India's rural areas, and the second five-year plan stipulates that this measure to develop agriculture will be extended to the entire country.

We visited many state-owned farms. These are not very large but very well-organized farms, and we believe that these farms are undoubtedly playing a positive role in completing the model farms.

When we were in India, we saw with our own eyes that the Indian people, who had freed themselves from the oppression of the colonialists, were able to bravely move forward along the road of developing industry and building an economically independent country. At the same time, we repeatedly saw with our own eyes the Indian people's deep desire for peace and cooperation with other countries.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru's visit to the Soviet Union this summer has already shown that the interests of the Soviet Union and India in the struggle for peace and international security are consistent, which is reflected in the first Soviet-Indian joint statement signed in Moscow on June 22 this year.

During our stay in Delhi, we held talks with Prime Minister Nehru and other Indian state leaders, during which we once again exchanged views on the issue of further expanding the friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and India, and on major international issues. The Soviet-Indian joint statement signed on December 13 is the result of our negotiations with Mr. Nehru and other Indian state leaders.

In this historic document of great international significance, the two governments affirmed their fidelity to the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs for any economic, political or ideological reasons, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.

These principles are a reliable foundation for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and political systems. The Soviet government believes that other countries, including the United States, Britain and France, if they also adopt these principles, will promote further easing of international tensions and building the necessary trust between nations.

The joint statement signed by the Soviet government and the Indian government in Delhi condemned the current increasingly terrible arms expansion and unanimously advocated stopping arms expansion so that the people of all countries can get rid of the heavy burden of military spending. The two governments, fully understanding the danger of the situation of constantly accumulating atomic and hydrogen weapons, advocated an unconditional ban on such weapons, so that mankind can get rid of the terror of atomic war and avoid the immeasurable material and human sacrifices brought by atomic war.

The Soviet Union has always advocated stopping arms expansion, advocating the conclusion of international agreements on banning atomic and hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, including rocket weapons, which have been particularly developed in recent years and can be said to have become intercontinental weapons. As early as May 1955, the Soviet Union put forward proposals on the issue of reducing conventional armaments and banning atomic weapons.

The realization of this proposal would be a major contribution to the cause of peace. We are pleased that the Indian government shares similar views with us on this noble cause.

As a result of our talks in India, a full mutual understanding was reached on the issue that the policy of establishing military blocs against other countries pursued by certain countries is constantly intensifying international tensions and deepening the danger of new wars, and this policy runs counter to the interests of expanding international cooperation between all countries with different state systems and social systems.

The people of Asia and Africa cannot but feel uneasy about the establishment of aggressive military blocs such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact, which was pieced together not long ago.

The instigators of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are the United States, Britain and France. As for the Baghdad Military Group, we all know that Britain played a major role in its piecing together. The Baghdad Pact is a manifestation of a new type of colonialism. The Baghdad Pact is based on aggression, which can be proved by the nature of the obligations undertaken by the countries participating in this military group. This has become particularly obvious since Iran was dragged into this group.

The Soviet government has repeatedly reminded the Iranian government that Iran's participation in this military group, which Western countries have long wanted to drag Iran into, is contrary to maintaining good-neighborly relations between Iran and the Soviet Union. At the same time, we have emphasized that we are willing to maintain good relations with Iran and other neighboring countries. Unfortunately, those who decide Iran's policies have taken a different path, participating in the Baghdad Treaty, and thus bear serious responsibility for the current situation.

The Iranian government has said that Iran's participation in the above-mentioned treaty is to strengthen peace in the Middle East. We disagree with this statement and believe that it is untenable. This statement is as unreasonable as saying that the purpose of the Atlantic Group is to strengthen peace in Europe.

We were pleased to hear Mr. Saeed, the head of the Iranian parliamentary delegation, say on this podium that the Iranian government and the Iranian people sincerely wish to strengthen friendly and good-neighborly relations with the Soviet Union. But we have to consider that the conclusion of the Baghdad Treaty and dragging the Soviet Union's neighbors into this treaty cannot but affect our country's security. Therefore, the Soviet Union must draw the necessary conclusions. The joint statement we signed during our visit to India condemned the policy of establishing military alliances and regional military blocs, and emphasized that peace and the real security of all countries can only be guaranteed through the joint efforts of all countries.

The Soviet government and the Indian government expressed their belief that there can be no lasting peace in Asia without giving the People's Republic of China its legitimate seat in the United Nations. The two governments advocated that other issues in the Far East, including the issue of Taiwan and the coastal islands of China, must be resolved quickly on the basis of satisfying the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China. Our joint statement expressed the hope that these issues could be resolved quickly through consultation.

The two governments emphasized that the Korean issue must be resolved in accordance with the interests of peace in the Far East, on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the Korean people, and that the Geneva Agreement on Indochina must be fulfilled. Everyone knows that despite the fact that, as the Soviet-Indian joint statement of December 13 justly pointed out, violating these agreements "will have very serious consequences for Indochina and the world," there are still people who want to hinder the implementation of these agreements.

The Soviet Union and India's consistent views on the outstanding issues in Asia and the Far East are undoubtedly an important factor that can promote the resolution of these issues on the basis of recognizing the legitimate rights of all countries and in accordance with the interests of maintaining peace.

The Soviet Union and India are pursuing peaceful policies and are successfully cooperating on some important issues that the United Nations is trying to resolve.

This is not only reflected in the consistent views of the two countries on issues such as disarmament, but also in the issue of admitting member states to the United Nations. We are pleased to note that the Indian government supports the Soviet Union's proposal to admit Albania, Jordan, Ireland, Portugal, Hungary, Italy, Austria, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, Ceylon, Nepal, Libya, Cambodia, Laos and Spain to the United Nations. We also share the hope expressed by Mr. Nehru that those countries that are still outside the United Nations will be quickly admitted as member states.

The Soviet-Indian joint statement pointed out that the Soviet Union and India's assessment of the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit and the assessment of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' meeting held not long ago are consistent. We and Mr. Nehru have reached a full understanding that we must continue to strive to ease the international situation and that negotiations are the best way to resolve disputes.

Comrade Deputies! The Soviet Union and India's consistent views on important international issues are not due to temporary reasons and short-term considerations. It stems from the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries in their desire for peace and security.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people are engaged in peaceful and creative labor to build a communist society, and are engaged in completing huge plans to develop the economy and culture and improve the welfare of the Soviet people. We have never threatened anyone in the past and now, and all peace-loving people have always regarded the Soviet Union as a strong fighter for peace and international cooperation.

India's peaceful policy also stems from the profound foundation related to the nature of the development of the Indian state. We see what efforts the Indian people are making to develop their country's economy. We learned from our conversations with Mr. Nehru and other Indian state leaders that India has great tasks in improving the people's welfare. The Indian people are deeply concerned about peace, and are concerned about being able to work peacefully and create material wealth for the motherland.

The common interests of the Soviet Union and India in the struggle to defend peace are a solid foundation for maintaining and further developing the friendly relations that have been formed between the two countries.

Economic ties between the two countries and how to utilize the existing possibilities in this regard are of great significance for further strengthening our relations with India. Therefore, we exchanged views with the Indian government on ways to further develop economic relations and on expanding trade between India and the Soviet Union.

We reached the following agreement: In the three years starting from 1956, the Soviet Union will provide India with one million tons of steel, of which 300,000 tons will be provided in the first year and 350,000 tons will be provided in each of the next two years. The two sides also agreed that India will also receive various industrial equipment and other commodities. The two sides also reached an agreement on the Soviet Union increasing its purchase of Indian commodities. The two sides believe that it is necessary to open regular shipping routes between the ports of the Soviet Union and India, and to establish air traffic between our two countries.

The Soviet government believes that international cooperation especially means the exchange of experience between countries (including countries with different social systems). During our visit to India, we pointed out that the Soviet Union is prepared to introduce its own experience, especially the experience of economic construction, to India. At the same time, we said that we do not want to force anyone to accept our experience, but if the friendly Indian people express the hope to use this experience to some extent, we are happy to introduce this experience to them. We also hope to appropriately utilize the experience of India, which has a long history of culture.

In addition to strengthening political and economic relations, the Soviet Union and India can and should develop cultural relations between the two countries, which is a desire shared by both sides. During our visit to India, we saw with our own eyes the tremendous creativity of the Indian people, who created world-renowned monuments of material and spiritual culture, unparalleled masterpieces of national architectural art, and preserved and developed a distinctive and outstanding stage art, dance and music of folk creation traditions.

On the other hand, Indian people are also very willing to get closer to the Soviet Union in culture. We welcome this willingness, because we believe that this approach is beneficial to the people of both countries.

In India, we met and talked with many politicians and social figures, leaders of industrial enterprises and farms, workers in science, culture and art, and people from all walks of life. They all showed a strong interest in the Soviet Union and the lives and work of the Soviet people. We have invited many of them to visit our country so that they can have the opportunity to further understand the Soviet people and see with their own eyes how the Soviet people live and work. There is no doubt that this will help further strengthen friendship and bring the people of our two countries closer together.

Our frank remarks on the Goa issue and the Kashmir issue caused great dissatisfaction among reactionary newspapers and certain politicians abroad.

As everyone knows, there is still a small Portuguese colony - Goa - on land that has always belonged to India. The Indian people are justly demanding the elimination of this intolerable situation and the liberation of Goa.

Just a look at the map of India and these "territories" of the Portuguese aggressors is enough to convince that the Indian government's demand to reunite this Indian territory with its motherland India is just and legitimate. The Soviet government supports India's just demand and believes that the retention of Portuguese colonies on Indian territory, as well as the retention of the colonial system in our era, is a disgrace to civilized people.

As for the Kashmir issue, this issue was created by those countries that harbor certain military and political purposes in this region. Certain countries, under the pretext of supporting Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, are trying to occupy this part of India in order to threaten and exert pressure on the region surrounding Kashmir from here. Some people are trying to artificially separate Kashmir from India and turn it into a foreign military base.

The people of Kashmir firmly oppose this imperialist policy. The Kashmir issue has already been resolved by the people of Kashmir themselves, who believe that Kashmir is an inseparable part of the Republic of India and are committed to building a new and independent India in the fraternal family of all nationalities of India, and to fighting for peace and the security of all countries. We were deeply convinced of this when we met with the people of Srinagar and when we talked with the respectable Kashmir Prime Minister Bakshi and his colleagues.

The Soviet government supports India's policy on the Kashmir issue. Because this policy is entirely in line with the interests of consolidating peace in this region of Asia. We said this when we were in Kashmir, and we reiterated this at a press conference in Delhi on December 14, and we say this again today.

Our trip to India brought our two countries closer together. The bond of friendship connecting the Soviet Union and India has been greatly strengthened. We also knew in the past that the Indian people had sincere brotherly feelings for the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. And we are more convinced of this during this visit to India. The all-round development of political and economic cooperation between our two countries has received a new and major impetus. There are broader possibilities for expanding cultural and scientific ties.

We Soviet people wish our great friend, the Indian people, success in developing the country's economy, developing industry and agriculture, improving the people's welfare and cultural level, and strengthening all aspects of the Republic of India as an independent and sovereign country.

The friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and India is an extremely important factor in ensuring peace and the security of all countries. We will continue to develop and strengthen this great friendship in the future.

Next, I will talk about the visit to Burma.

Burma has embarked on the path of national independent development. This is the result of the selfless struggle of the entire Burmese people against the rule of British colonialists for generations, and later during World War II against the aggressive actions of Japanese militarists who brutally robbed the Burmese people and plundered their wealth.

The Burmese people showed determination and heroism in the struggle for independence. Aung San, the leader of the Burmese people's struggle for independence and a national hero, and his comrades were unfortunately killed by enemies of the national liberation movement. But the people achieved their goal: the chains of colonial enslavement were broken, and the independent state - the Union of Burma - was established. The Burmese people have begun to restore and consolidate their country's economy, constantly overcoming the huge difficulties caused by colonial oppression and war damage.

Prime Minister U Nu of Burma's visit to the Soviet Union in October-November this year laid the foundation for close friendly contacts between the Union of Burma and the Soviet Union.

The Soviet-Burmese joint statement was signed in Moscow on November 3, which is full of wishes to consolidate international trust and cooperation. The statement emphasized that the sincere and friendly relations between the two countries are based on the famous five principles of peaceful coexistence. These five principles have been recognized by many countries and people all over the world, because the purpose of these principles is entirely to consolidate international peace.

Our visit to the Union of Burma from December 1 to 7 this year, our meetings with the people of this hospitable country, and our personal contacts with Burmese leaders once again proved that Burma actively advocates maintaining international friendly relations, condemns the policy of establishing military blocs, and strives for all countries to make joint and collective efforts to consolidate peace.

On December 1, we arrived in Yangon, the capital of Burma, where we were greeted by the citizens and leaders of the Burmese government led by Prime Minister U Nu with a friendly and very warm welcome. We also encountered this joyous welcome from the Burmese people in other cities during the six days we stayed in the country. In addition to visiting Yangon, we also visited Shan State, which joined the Union of Burma, and its capital Taunggyi, as well as Mandalay, the second largest city in Burma. Everywhere, the Burmese people warmly and sincerely greeted the Soviet people and the Soviet Union, and congratulated the consolidation of Burmese-Soviet friendship.

The meeting with the students and teachers of Yangon University left us with a particularly pleasant impression. Several thousand young Burmese men and women study at this university.

The younger generation of people who have freed themselves from their colonial disenfranchisement have initially accumulated scientific knowledge, which is necessary for independent development along the path chosen by the people, and for developing the national economy and culture.

The students of this university listened very carefully to Comrade Khrushchev's speech, in which he introduced them in detail to the Soviet Union, our lives and our country's education system. His speech condemned the colonial policies of imperialist countries, and talked about the Soviet Union's non-support of colonialists' policies and its firm opposition to these policies, which aroused great interest. These words and many other words in the speech aroused enthusiastic applause from the students and professors present.

During our visit to Burma, we had useful meetings and conversations with Dr. Ba U, the President of the Union of Burma, and we handed him a personal letter from Comrade K.E. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Dr. Ba U expressed great gratitude for Comrade Voroshilov's letter.

On behalf of the government, we have invited the Minister of Defense of Burma, U Ba Swe, and the Minister of Industry and Mines, U Kyaw Nyein, to visit the Soviet Union. Both ministers have accepted the invitation.

It should be particularly pointed out that we had several talks with Prime Minister U Nu of the Union of Burma in a warm and friendly atmosphere. The Soviet-Burmese statement signed in Yangon on December 6 is the result of these talks.

The statement pointed out that the two countries have consistent views on a number of major international issues to be resolved, including disarmament, including the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen weapons, the issue of the Far East, including the issue of satisfying the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights to Taiwan and the coastal islands of China, and the issue of enabling the People's Republic of China to obtain its legitimate seat in the United Nations.

The two governments reiterated the unanimous view that the policy of establishing blocs should be condemned, and that only by implementing a policy of not participating in these blocs can trust and sincerity be established between countries. The Soviet-Burmese statement said that "Consolidating international peace and ensuring that the people of all countries have confidence in their future cannot be achieved by establishing blocs, but only by the joint and collective efforts of the people of all countries." The statement also showed that the two governments have consistent views on the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit and the meeting of the foreign ministers of these countries held not long ago. The Soviet-Burmese statement emphasized that both sides advocated continuing to make joint efforts to resolve outstanding international issues.

The foundation of our relations with Burma is solid, because both sides are deeply concerned about maintaining and Expanding cooperation on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence.

Our economic relations with the Union of Burman are based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and there is no situation where one party forces the other party to accept political or any enslaving conditions. During our visit to Yangon, we held negotiations on strengthening cooperation between the Soviet Union and Burma in the economic, cultural, scientific and technological fields, especially on expanding trade between Burma and the Soviet Union, entirely based on these principles endorsed by the government of the Union of Burma.

The two sides reached an agreement that the Soviet Union will cooperate in formulating Burma's agricultural development plan, carrying out major water conservancy projects and constructing certain industrial enterprises in Burma. The Burmese side will sell rice to the Soviet Union, and if the quantity of rice purchased cannot offset the value of the materials we provide, then Burma will have the right to credit loans, that is, to pay in installments in kind over several years according to the agreement between the two sides.

In order to express goodwill and respect for the people of the Union of Burma, we were entrusted by the Soviet government to represent the Soviet government to suggest to the people of the Union of Burma that the Soviet Union provide manpower and equipment to build and equip a technical college in Yangon as a gift to the people of the Union of Burma.

The government of the Union of Burma deeply understands the motives of the Soviet government in making this suggestion, and accepts this gift with deep gratitude to the Soviet government and the Soviet people.

Prime Minister U Nu also proposed on behalf of the people of the Union of Burma to donate to the Soviet Union a corresponding quantity of rice and some other Burmese products. On behalf of the Soviet people, we gratefully accepted these gifts.

Burmese leaders and Burmese intellectuals have expressed a strong desire to develop cultural relations with the Soviet Union. We expressed that the Soviet Union is prepared to develop cultural relations with Burma, because this will only benefit the two countries and help further strengthen the friendly relations between us.

The Burmese government expressed satisfaction with the goodwill shown by the Soviet government in the talks in Yangon. On our part, we wish the Union of Burma to eliminate the consequences of colonial oppression and war damage as soon as possible, and hope that the Burmese people will unite and make further achievements in building their country's economy, which will be free from foreign control and free from the difficulties it still suffers due to the attempts of certain countries to put Burma in an unfavorable position in the international market.

The Soviet Union and the Burmese people are united in their desire to maintain and consolidate peace, ensure the security of all countries, and more widely expand cooperation and friendship between the people of all countries. The visit of Comrade Khrushchev and I to Burma as guests of the Burmese government, and our meetings with the Burmese people, brought the Soviet Union and Burma closer together. The friendship and cooperation between our two countries is becoming an increasingly important factor in the struggle to ease international tensions.

We will make every effort to make the friendship and cooperation between our two countries increasingly consolidated and developed for the benefit and happiness of our two peoples.

Now let's talk about the results of our visit to Afghanistan.

The significance and results of our visit to Afghanistan as guests of the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan cannot be overemphasized. The Soviet Union and Afghanistan share a 2,346-kilometer common border, and a long and close friendly relationship connects us. The Afghan people won the independence of their country in a fierce struggle against the British imperialists who attempted to turn Afghanistan into their colony. The heroic Afghan people won three victories in this struggle, and in 1919 finally declared their independence and established their own country. The Soviet state's defeat of the interventionists in Central Asia played a huge role in Afghanistan's declaration of independence.

Afghanistan has always received the unwavering support of the Soviet state. Our country was the first country to recognize Afghanistan as a sovereign state as early as 1919. Afghanistan was also one of the first countries to recognize the Soviet state established as a result of the Great October Socialist Revolution. From these facts alone, it can be seen how deeply rooted the good relations between our two countries are. Experience has proved that this good-neighborly relationship is entirely in line with the vital interests of the people of both countries.

Our talks with His Majesty King Mohammed Zahir Shah of Afghanistan in Kabul, as well as with Afghan Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan and other prominent Afghan state leaders, proved that they hope to maintain and develop the good-neighborly relations between our two countries in the future.

We can only welcome this wish of the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, and we have talked about this when we were in Kabul. On the part of the Soviet government, we have made and will continue to make all the necessary efforts to make our relations with this neighboring country increasingly consolidated and developed.

The exchange of views with Afghan state leaders showed the two governments' desire to promote the further easing of international tensions and expand international cooperation. We are pleased to point out that the two governments have consistent views on a number of international issues, including the issue of disarmament and the issues of Asia and the Far East, which is

    1955年12月29日在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上
　　布尔加宁关于访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的报告
    代表同志们：苏联最高苏维埃这次会议是在1955年即将结束的时候举行的。这一年是重大国际事态发展的一年，这种发展导向国际关系的重要变化。
    即将结束的这一年将作为过去时期发展的国际紧张局势获得肯定的转变的一年而载入史册。这种转变在很大程度上是由于苏联的努力的结果。苏联所作的努力的目的是在于保证和平和各国人民的安全、促进国际信任和发展国家之间的广泛的政治、经济和文化的联系，而不问这些国家的社会和政治制度如何。
    对于苏联外交政策说来，1955年是为巩固和平、为缓和国际紧张局势和为发展各国人民和各国之间的合作而进行特别积极的和坚持不渝的斗争的一年。今天谁也不能否认苏联在这方面所作的努力获得了显著的成就。
    苏联同印度、缅甸和阿富汗——赫鲁晓夫同志和我在不久以前曾经访问了这些国家——之间的友谊和合作的发展无疑地是对于和平的一个重要的贡献。这次访问是苏联的爱好和平的外交政策的充分体现，而且是经历许多重要国际事态发展的1955年的一个适当的结束。
    我们到印度、缅甸和阿富汗访问的直接结果是巩固和扩大了苏联和这些国家之间的友谊和合作关系，并且进一步密切了苏联人民同伟大的印度人民、缅甸人民和阿富汗人民之间的接触。但是它的重要意义还不止于此。
    这次旅行具有一种巨大的国际重要性，特别是在于：它再次证明了苏联外交政策的根本的列宁主义原则——具有不同社会制度和政治制度的国家的和平共处原则的正确性。这次旅行充分表明并且不容置辩地证明：这个原则是加强和平和各国人民安全以及促进国际信任的可靠基础。
    事实是：居住着世界人口一半以上的亚洲国家，今天在国际生活中起着越来越重要的作用。若干世纪以来，许多亚洲国家的人民曾经遭受到残酷的殖民压迫，而且某些民族现在仍然遭受着这种压迫。殖民主义者努力为他们的政策和他们对亚洲人民的统治作辩护，曾经试图而且现在仍然试图证明这些民族在文化方面和社会方面是落后的。但是，人们不应该忘记，亚洲人民的历史发展，在欧洲人民出现在历史舞台之前好久就开始了。如果说亚洲的社会和政治进展在过去几世纪被延缓了，被阻止了，这并不是由于亚洲人民的过错，而是由于殖民主义者的过错，他们在亚洲国家——不仅在亚洲而且在非洲——硬实行了一种基于暴力、掠夺和残酷剥削居民的政府制度。
    这种制度带给殖民主义者以巨大的财富，但是对于亚洲和非洲的被压迫的人民说来，这种制度带来了贫困和巨大的痛苦。
    这种情况持续了很长的时间，但是它不可能永远持续下去。任何多少熟悉社会发展法则的人都很清楚，民族解放运动一定会在亚洲国家发展起来，它的规模一定会愈来愈大。事情的情况正是这样。亚洲人民已经开始觉悟，而且挺起他们的身来。有助于这种巨大的觉醒的因素是在我们这个国家发生的伟大的十月社会主义革命和由于第一次世界大战特别是第二次世界大战的结果而引起的殖民国家的削弱。
    我们伟大的导师列宁曾经屡次在谈到东方国家的时候指出，这些国家的群众肯定地会起来结束他们的不平等的地位，而成为他们的生活的独立建设者。列宁常常说，亿万亚洲人民成为世界历史上的一个积极的因素而且在决定全人类的命运中起他们的作用的时候将会到来。这种时候现在已经到来了。今天，我们看到殖民制度在亚洲和东方各地正在崩溃。
    在中国共产党领导下的伟大中国人民已经走上了民族更生和民族独立的大道，而且踏上了走向建立一个社会主义社会的道路。中国人民的这个具有历史意义的胜利已经对亚洲和东方的整个局势发生了巨大的影响。
    这给予殖民地人民和附属国人民的民族解放运动一个新的刺激。
    伟大的印度的人民以及缅甸的人民已经摆脱了殖民统治的枷锁。这些国家的人民受到争取他们的国家的复兴和新生的奋斗的鼓舞，现在已经进入独立的经济的和民族的发展的阶段。
    印度尼西亚和一些其他东方国家也已经走上了自由独立的道路。
    加强民族独立的运动在阿拉伯国家中的规模越来越大。非洲人民在积极进行他们争取解放的斗争。
    代表同志们，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和我自己在印度待了三个星期。从我们最初踏上印度的土地的时候起，一直到我们离开那个殷勤好客的国土，我们时时刻刻都被包围在印度人民的友谊和热情的气氛中，他们对我们表示了最热烈和最友好的感情，并且通过我们热情地对苏联表示敬意。这说明为什么我们的印度之行可以说是同伟大的印度人民的会见。
    当我们去印度的时候我们知道那是一个对我们友好的国家，我们可以期望受到热烈的欢迎。但是我们所见所闻远远出乎我们的预料。当我们到达德里步下飞机的时候，我们受到了以尼赫鲁总理为首的官员们的迎接，人多得看不到边，我们听到了经久不息的千千万万人的欢呼声。聚集在那里的人民用他们的本国话对我们欢呼，我们不懂他们的话。但是我们能够理解，那是友谊和欢乐的言语，听起来是如此亲切，如此诚恳。我们觉得我们是到了苏联人民的真正的朋友那里，到了我们的兄弟那里。
    在德里，大约有一百万人民到拉姆利拉广场上来欢迎我们。那真是一种令人难忘的景象。巨大的广场上满是潮水般起伏的人群，你可以听到从四面八方发出欢呼，你还可以看到这样一些俄文的标语：“印度人和俄国人是兄弟”，“印苏友谊万岁！”，“世界和平万岁！”，“欢迎你们，我们亲爱的苏联客人！”。这些欢迎的话是从印度人民的心底里发出的。
    我们自豪地认识到印度人民所给予我们的热情欢迎是对我们光荣的祖国和伟大的苏联人民而发的。苏联人民在他们的共产党的领导下进行了伟大的十月社会主义革命，击溃了他们许多国外和国内的敌人，并且坚持不渝地执行了我们党的总路线，从而在世界上建成了第一个社会主义国家。
    印度人民通过我们向苏联各族人民表示衷心的祝贺，苏联各族人民在伟大的卫国战争的年代里、在反对法西斯野兽的艰苦斗争中保卫了他们的成果，并且现在正在以他们一贯的建设性的努力建设着新的共产主义社会。
    我们看到，我们国家的成就、它的成功和胜利是为印度人民所理解的，他们热诚地、全心全意地欢迎这些成就。
    当我们再进一步回忆到同孟买、哥印拜陀、班加罗尔、马德拉斯、斋浦尔、斯利那加和其他城市的印度人民会见的情况的时候，要无动于衷是不可能的。但是给我们留下了最难忘和最生动的印象的是我们同加尔各答人民会见的情形。还在我们到达的前几天，邻近城市和乡村的人就开始纷纷到这里来了。印度总理尼赫鲁先生到了加尔各答。报纸后来写道，在市内街道上欢迎我们的有三百万人以上。这是一个热闹、汹涌的人海。就在这里我们听到了热情的欢迎的话，对苏联人民友好和热爱的话。有人告诉我们说，加尔各答群众大会的参加者中有许多人为了要占到一个靠近讲台的位子，在前一天晚上就到广场上来了。
    对我们苏联人民的代表友好的表现，不仅在大城市中看得到，就是在小乡村中也看得到，这些地方的男女老少都走到路上来欢迎我们，向我们致意。在这些地方我们也听到了向我们国家致敬的欢呼。
    同印度议员们的会见给我们留下很深的印象，他们十分热情地欢迎我们，十分注意地倾听了我们的讲话，并且热烈地欢迎我们的讲话。印度政府人士和我们访问过的各省（邦）的政府人士都热情殷勤地接待我们。他们对我们作了很多的照顾，使我们对印度的访问愉快而有益。
    在德里，我们是印度总统普拉沙德先生的客人。我们住在他的府中。普拉沙德先生尽量使我和尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志以及与我们同行的同志们在他的府中感到方便和舒适。我们同普拉沙德先生作了几次谈话。我们把苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席克·叶·伏罗希洛夫同志的信交给了他。普拉沙德先生对这封信表示十分感谢，并且要我们把回信转交给克·叶·伏罗希洛夫同志。
    我们曾经同卓越的政治家、印度副总统拉德哈克里希南先生会晤，他曾经以国会议长的身份热情地接待我们，并且在他的发言中说了苏联许多好话。
    必须特别谈一谈我们同当代的一位杰出政治家印度总理尼赫鲁先生的会晤。我们同尼赫鲁总理的各次会晤，都贯穿着真诚的友好感情。我们无论到什么地方，一直都感觉得到他对我们的照顾和关心。
    我们后来所会见的缅甸联邦和阿富汗的人民，也对苏联人民表示了热情真诚的热爱和友好的感情。在缅甸的城市和乡村，在阿富汗的首都喀布尔，居民都愉快和盛情地向我们致意，也就是向苏联和苏联人民致意。
    在德里和印度的其他城市、在仰光和喀布尔，人们都说，我们苏联和苏联人民的代表在这些城市中所受到的友好和盛大的欢迎，是这些城市所从来没有过的。
    我们在访问印度期间，了解了印度人民许多方面的生活。印度政府给了我们机会到全国东、南、西、北各地去访问。在访问期间，我们坐着我们苏联的谢·弗·伊柳辛设计的“伊尔14式”飞机总共飞行了22，500公里，其中单在印度就飞行了大约一万公里。
    我们访问了印度的各个区、许多城市、乡村、建设工程和工业企业，到过了一些国营农场，访问了许多文化机构，参观了古老和丰富的印度文化的著名纪念物。
    英国殖民者统治印度几乎有两个世纪，对英国殖民者说来，这个富饶的国家是宗主国的农业的和原料的属地和工业品的销售市场。自然，英国并没有致力于发展印度的工业。所有的殖民者都是这样做的，因为他们的目的是要从殖民地尽量榨取利润，而完全不给、或者几乎完全不给殖民地东西。
    印度人民摆脱了殖民者的压迫，恢复了本国的独立，并且在自己的政府的领导下已经着手发展本国经济。在这条道路上已经取得了初步的成就。我们访问和了解了印度在近几年创立起来的主要工业区。它位于比哈尔省和西孟加拉省接壤处的德莫打河流域上。这里分布着印度一部分冶金、机器制造和化学工业，有印度的矿井和矿山。
    在奇塔兰詹市，我们参观了一个新建的机车制造厂。这是一个国营企业，它是1950年开始生产机车的。在我们去那里的时候，工厂里刚出产了第三百个火车头。印度人以这一个工厂自豪，并且认为它是他们国家机器制造业的先锋。工程师们请我们参观工厂时，特别强调有百分之八十多的机车零件都是在本厂生产的。
    我们还参观了辛德利市的一所人造肥料厂。这也是一个新建的国营企业，它在印度的经济中有重要的作用，因为印度的农业急需矿质肥料。围绕这所工厂而兴起的辛德利市只有四、五年的历史。
    印度是个农业国，全国四分之三以上的居民都从事农业。关系到印度农业生产发展的最重要问题之一，是土地的人工灌溉。非灌溉区的土地收获量很低，印度政府做了许多工作，来建立规模宏大的灌溉系统。
    我们仔细地了解了印度最大的建设工程之一巴克拉—南加尔水利枢纽，这里筑起一条大坝，还要建设一个电力站。这项巨大建设工程的考虑是周密和大胆的，许多技术问题的解决很值得注意。但是我们在这里看到的最值得注意的东西是建设这项工程的工人和工程师们的巨大劳动热情。巴克拉—南加尔建设工程使我们回忆起我们第一个五年计划时期的情景，当时我们建立了自己第一批巨大的企业。
    印度政府找寻着在土地私有制的范围内发展农业生产的道路。为了这个目标，印度政府在农村采取许多措施，例如：“乡村发展计划”和“国家发展促进计划”。有人告诉我们，目前印度约20％的农村执行了这些计划，第二个五年计划规定这个发展农业的措施将要推广到全国各地。
    我们参观了许多国营农场。这些是不很大的但是组织得非常好的农场，我们认为，这些农场无疑地是在完成示范农场的积极作用。
    我们在印度的时候，亲眼看到摆脱了殖民者压迫的印度人民，能够勇敢地沿着发展工业的道路，沿着建立一个在经济上独立的国家的道路向前迈进。同时，我们一次又一次地亲眼看到印度人民要求和平和同其他国家合作的深切愿望。
    印度总理尼赫鲁先生今年夏天在苏联的访问就已经表明苏联和印度两国在争取和平和国际安全的斗争中的利益是一致的，这点表现在今年6月22日在莫斯科签订的第一个苏印联合声明中。
    我们在德里期间，就曾经同尼赫鲁总理先生和印度其他国家领导人举行会谈，会谈中我们再次就进一步扩大苏联和印度两国之间的友好合作的问题和重大的国际问题交换了意见。12月13日签字的苏印联合声明是我们同尼赫鲁先生和印度其他国家领导人谈判的结果。
    在这个具有重大国际意义的历史性文件中，两国政府肯定他们忠实于互相尊重领土完整和主权，互不侵犯，互不借任何经济、政治或意识形态性质的理由干涉内政，平等互利和和平共处的原则。
    这些原则是社会和政治制度不同的国家和平共处的可靠基础。苏联政府认为，其他国家，包括美国、英国和法国在内，如果也采纳这些原则，将会促进进一步缓和国际紧张局势和建立国际间必要的信任。
    苏联政府和印度政府在德里签订的联合声明，谴责了目前进行的规模越来越可怕的扩充军备，并且一致主张停止扩充军备，以使各国人民摆脱军费的重担。两国政府由于充分理解到一贯不停地积存原子武器和氢武器的这种情况的危险性，主张无条件地禁止这种武器，使人类摆脱对原子战争的恐怖，免遭原子战争带来的不可计量的物力和人力的牺牲。
    苏联一贯主张停止扩充军备，主张缔结关于禁止原子武器和氢武器以及包括火箭武器在内的其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际协定，火箭武器在最近几年来获得了特别的发展，可以说成了洲际武器。苏联早在1955年5月就提出了关于裁减常规军备和禁止原子武器问题的建议。
    这个建议的实现就会是对和平事业的重大贡献。我们高兴的是，印度政府对这个高尚的事业同我们有着相似的观点。
    我们在印度会谈的结果，对这样一个问题达成了充分的相互谅解，这就是：某些国家执行的建立反对其他国家的军事集团的政策，在不断地加紧着国际紧张局势，加深着新战争的危险，而这种政策是同扩大国家制度和社会制度不同的一切国家之间的国际合作的利益背道而驰的。
    亚洲和非洲人民，对于建立像东南亚条约组织和不久以前拼凑成的巴格达条约之类的侵略性军事集团不能不感到不安。
    东南亚条约组织的鼓动者是美国、英国和法国。至于巴格达军事集团，我们都很清楚，在它的拼凑过程中扮演主要角色的是英国。巴格达条约是新型的殖民主义的表现。巴格达条约的基础是侵略性质的，这从参加这个军事集团的国家所承担的义务的性质上可以得到证明。自从把伊朗拖进这个集团后，这点就特别明显了。
    苏联政府曾经一再提醒伊朗政府注意：伊朗参加这个西方国家老早就想把伊朗拖进去的军事集团，是同保持伊朗和苏联两国之间的善邻关系相抵触的。我们同时曾经强调指出，我们愿意同伊朗和同其他邻国一样保持良好的关系。遗憾的是，决定伊朗政策的那些人走上了另外一条道路，参加了巴格达条约，从而对目前的局面负有严重的责任。
    伊朗政府把事情说成似乎伊朗参加上述条约为的是加强中东和平，我们不同意这种说法，认为这是站不住脚的。这种说法同把大西洋集团的目的说成是加强欧洲和平同样地没有道理。
    我们满意地倾听了伊朗议会代表团团长赛义德先生在这个讲台上讲的话，他说伊朗政府和伊朗人民真诚地愿意加强同苏联的友好和善邻的关系。但是我们不得不考虑到：订立巴格达条约和把苏联的邻国拖进这个条约，不会不影响我国的安全。因此，苏联必然作出必需的结论。我们在访问印度的时候所签订的联合声明，谴责了建立军事联盟和区域性军事集团的政策，并且着重指出，和平和各国人民的真正安全只有通过各国的共同努力才能得到保障。
    苏联政府和印度政府表示相信，如果不给中华人民共和国以它在联合国中的合法席位，亚洲就不可能有持久和平。两国政府主张必须迅速解决远东的其他问题，其中包括在满足中华人民共和国的合法权利的基础上解决台湾和中国沿海岛屿的问题。我们的联合声明表示，希望这些问题能够通过协商很快得到解决。
    两国政府着重指出，必须在承认朝鲜人民的民族权利的基础上，按照远东和平的利益解决朝鲜问题，必须履行关于印度支那的日内瓦协定。大家知道，尽管像12月13日的苏印联合声明中公正地指出的，破坏这些协定，“将对印度支那和全世界造成非常严重的后果”，但是现在仍然有人想阻挠这些协定的履行。
    苏联和印度对亚洲和远东悬而未决的问题看法的一致，无疑是一个重要的因素，它能够促进在承认各国人民的合法权利的基础上，根据维护和平的利益解决这些问题。
    苏联和印度执行着和平政策，在联合国正在设法解决的一些重要问题上成功地实行合作。
    这不仅表现在两国对裁军这样的问题看法的一致上，而且还表现在接纳联合国会员国的问题上。我们满意地指出，印度政府支持苏联关于接纳阿尔巴尼亚、约旦、爱尔兰、葡萄牙、匈牙利、意大利、奥地利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、芬兰、锡兰、尼泊尔、利比亚、柬埔寨、老挝和西班牙这16个国家加入联合国的建议。我们也怀着尼赫鲁先生所表示的这种希望：现在还留在联合国之外的那些国家将能迅速地被接纳为会员国。
    苏印联合声明指出，苏联和印度对日内瓦四国政府首脑会议结果的估计以及对不久以前举行的四国外交部长会议的估计是一致的。我们和尼赫鲁先生取得了充分的谅解，认为必须继续为缓和国际局势而努力，认为谈判是解决争执问题的最好方法。
    代表同志们！苏联和印度对重要国际问题看法的一致，并不是出于暂时的原因和一朝一夕的考虑。它是产生于两国人民渴望和平和安全的根本利益的。
    苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导之下，从事着建设共产主义社会的和平创造性的劳动，从事着完成发展经济和文化以及提高苏联人民福利的巨大计划。我们过去和现在从来没有威胁谁，所有爱好和平的人民一向把苏联看作是争取和平和国际合作的坚强战士。
    印度的和平政策也是从同印度国家的发展的性质有关的深厚基础出发的。我们看到，印度人民在作如何的努力来发展本国的经济。我们从同尼赫鲁先生和印度其他国家领导人的谈话中知道了，印度在增进人民福利方面的任务是很伟大的。印度人民热切关心和平，关心能够和平劳动和为祖国创造物质财富。
    苏联和印度在保卫和平的斗争中的共同利益是保持和进一步发展两国之间已经形成的友好关系的牢固的基础。
    两国之间的经济联系和如何利用这方面现有的可能，对进一步加强我们同印度的关系具有重要意义。因此，我们同印度政府就进一步发展经济关系的办法、就扩大印度和苏联之间的贸易的问题交换了意见。
    我们达成了下列协议：在从1956年开始的以后三年中，苏联将提供给印度一百万吨钢材，其中第一年为30万吨，以后两年每年为35万吨。双方并且取得同意，印度还将获得各种工业设备和其他商品的供应。双方还就苏联增加购买印度商品的问题达成了协议。双方认为有必要在苏联和印度两国港口之间开辟经常的航线，建立我们两国之间的空中交通。
    苏联政府认为，国际合作特别意味着各国之间（其中包括社会制度不同的国家）经验的交换。在我们访问印度的时候，我们指出：苏联准备把自己的经验、首先是经济建设的经验介绍给印度。同时，我们说，我们并不希望强使任何人接受我们的经验，但是，如果对我们表示友好的印度人民希望在某种程度上运用这种经验，我们很乐于把这种经验介绍给他们。我们也希望适当地运用具有悠久文化的印度的经验。
    苏联同印度除了加强政治和经济关系之外，还可以而且应当发展两国之间的文化关系，这是双方都同样具有的愿望。在访问印度期间，我们亲眼看到印度人民的巨大的创造力，他们创造了举世驰名的物质和精神文化的纪念物，民族建筑艺术的无双杰作，保存和发展着民间创作传统的自成一派的卓越的舞台艺术、舞蹈和音乐。
    另一方面，印度人士也十分愿意在文化上同苏联接近。我们欢迎这种意愿，因为我们相信，这种接近是对两国人民都有好处的。
    在印度，我们会见了许多政治家和社会人士、工业企业和农场的领导人、科学、文化和艺术工作者，以及各行各业的人物，并且和他们交谈。他们大家都对苏联，对苏联人民的生活和工作感到浓厚的兴趣。我们已经邀请其中的许多人前来我国访问，以便使他们有机会进一步认识苏联人民，亲眼看看苏联人民是怎样生活和工作的。毫无疑问，这将有助于进一步加强友谊，促使我们两国人民更加亲近。
    我们在果阿问题上，在克什米尔问题上的坦率言论引起了国外反动报纸和某些政治家极大的不满。
    大家知道，在历来属于印度的土地上，到目前为止还保存着葡萄牙的一块不大的殖民地——果阿。印度人民正义地要求消除这种不能容忍的情况，要求解放果阿。
    只消看一下印度的地图和葡萄牙侵略者的这些“领地”，就足以相信印度政府要求使这块印度的领土重新合并于自己的祖国印度是公正和合法的。苏联政府支持印度的这个正义的要求，并且认为，在印度领土上还保留有葡萄牙殖民地以及我们这个时代还保留着殖民制度，是文明人民的耻辱。
    至于说到克什米尔问题，这个问题是那些在这个地区抱着某种军事政治目的的国家制造出来的。某些国家借口在克什米尔问题上支持巴基斯坦，企图盘踞在印度的这一部分，以便从这里对克什米尔周围的地区进行威胁和施加压力。有人企图人为地把克什米尔从印度割离开来，把它变成外国的军事基地。
    克什米尔人民坚决反对这种帝国主义政策。克什米尔问题已经由克什米尔人民自己解决了，他们认为克什米尔是印度共和国不可分割的一部分，并且致力于在印度各族人民的兄弟大家庭中建设新的独立的印度，为和平和各国人民的安全而斗争。我们在同斯利那加的人民会晤的时候以及同可敬的克什米尔总理巴克希先生和他的同僚会谈的时候，深深地相信了这一点。
    苏联政府支持印度在克什米尔问题上的政策。因为这一政策完全符合巩固亚洲这一地区的和平的利益。我们在克什米尔的时候曾经这样说过，12月14日在德里的记者招待会上又重申了这一点，今天我们也是这样说。
    我们的印度之行使我们两国更加接近了。联系着苏联和印度的友谊的纽带大大加强了。我们过去也知道，印度人民对苏联各族人民怀着真诚的兄弟般的感情。而在这次访问印度的过程中更加相信了这一点。我们两国之间在政治上和经济上的合作的全面发展得到了一个新的重大的鼓舞。扩大文化和科学联系有了更加广泛的可能性。
    我们苏联人祝我们的伟大朋友印度人民在发展国家的经济、发展工业和农业、提高人民的福利和文化水平、加强作为一个独立的、具有主权的国家的印度共和国各方面都获得成就。
    苏联和印度之间的友好和合作是保障和平和各国人民的安全的一个极重要的因素。我们今后也将发展和加强这种伟大的友谊。
    下面我谈谈访问缅甸的情况。
    缅甸已经走上了国家独立发展的道路，这是缅甸全国人民对英国殖民者的几代统治，以及后来在第二次世界大战期间又对残酷地抢劫缅甸人民和掠夺他们财富的日本军国主义者的侵略行动进行了忘我斗争的结果。
    缅甸人民在争取独立的斗争中表现了决心和英勇精神。缅甸人民争取独立斗争的领袖、民族英雄昂山和他的战友不幸遭到民族解放运动的敌人的杀害。但是人民达到了自己的目的：殖民奴役的锁链挣断了，独立的国家——缅甸联邦成立了。缅甸人民已经开始恢复和巩固自己国家的经济，不断克服着由于殖民压迫和战争破坏的结果而产生的巨大困难。
    今年10月到11月缅甸总理吴努的访问苏联，为缅甸联邦和苏联之间密切的友好接触奠定了开端。
    11月3日在莫斯科签署了苏联—缅甸联合声明，这个声明充满对巩固国际信任和合作的愿望。在这个声明中强调指出了，两国真诚和友好关系是以有名的和平共处的五项原则为基础的，这五项原则已经得到了许多国家和世界各国人民的公认，因为这些原则的目的完全是为了巩固国际和平。
    我们从今年12月1日到7日在缅甸联邦所作的访问，同这个好客的国家人民的会晤以及同缅甸领导人的个人接触，又一次证明了缅甸积极主张维持国际友好关系，谴责建立军事集团的政策，并且争取各国为了巩固和平而共同地集体地努力。
    12月1日，我们到达了缅甸的首都仰光，在那里，我们受到市民和以吴努总理为首的缅甸政府领导人的友好的和非常热烈的欢迎。缅甸人民这种兴高采烈的欢迎，我们在这个国家停留的六天当中也在其他城市遇见过。我们除了访问仰光以外，还访问了加入缅甸联邦的掸邦和它的首府东枝，以及缅甸的第二大城市曼德勒。缅甸人民到处都亲切和热诚地向苏联人民和苏联致意，并且祝贺缅苏两国友谊的巩固。
    同仰光大学的学生和教师的会见，给我们留下了特别愉快的印象。在这个大学里求学的有几千名缅甸青年男女。
    摆脱了殖民地无权地位的人民的青年一代，初步积累了科学知识，而科学知识对于沿着人民选定的道路独立向前发展、对于发展民族经济和文化是必要的。
    这所大学的学生非常注意地倾听了赫鲁晓夫同志的演说，他详细地向他们介绍了苏联、我们的生活和我国的教育制度。他在演说中谴责了帝国主义国家的殖民政策，谈到了苏联不支持殖民主义者的政策并且坚决反对这些政策，这些话引起了很大的兴趣。这些话以及演说中的其他许多话引起了在座的学生和教授的热烈掌声。
    我们在缅甸访问的时候，同缅甸联邦总统巴宇博士作了有益的会面和交谈，我们把苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席克·叶·伏罗希洛夫同志个人的信转交给了他。巴宇博士对伏罗希洛夫同志的书信表示很大的感激。
    我们曾经代表政府邀请缅甸的国防部长吴巴瑞和工业和矿务部长吴觉迎访问苏联。这两位部长都已经接受了邀请。
    特别应该指出，我们同缅甸联邦总理吴努在热情和友好的气氛中进行了几次会谈。12月6日在仰光签字的苏联—缅甸声明就是这些会谈的结果。
    声明中指出两国对一些有待解决的主要国际问题的观点是一致的，这些问题是：裁军问题、包括禁止原子武器和氢武器问题、远东问题、包括必须满足中华人民共和国对台湾和中国沿海岛屿的合法权利的问题，和使中华人民共和国在联合国取得它的合法席位的问题。
    两国政府重申了这样一个一致的意见，即建立集团的政策应当受到谴责，只有实行不参加这些集团的政策，才有助于建立各国之间的信任和诚意。苏联—缅甸声明中说，“巩固国际和平和保证各国人民对他们的前途具有信心，不是用建立集团的办法所能做到的，只有各国人民进行共同的和集体的努力才能做到。”声明也表明了两国政府对日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果和这些国家的外交部长不久以前举行的会议的结果的看法是一致的。苏联—缅甸声明中强调指出，双方主张继续进行共同努力，以解决悬而未决的国际问题。
    我们同缅甸的关系的基础是巩固的，因为双方都密切关怀在和平共处的五项原则的基础上保持和扩大合作。
    我们同缅甸联邦的经济关系是以平等互利的原则为基础的，而且并没有一方强迫另一方接受政治上的或任何奴役性的条件的情况。我们在访问仰光期间，完全根据缅甸联邦政府所赞同的这些原则举行了关于加强苏联和缅甸在经济、文化和科学技术方面实行合作的谈判，特别是关于扩大缅甸和苏联之间的贸易的谈判。
    双方达成协议，苏联将在制定缅甸的农业发展计划，在缅甸进行主要的水利工程和建筑某些工业企业方面进行合作。缅甸方面将出售大米给苏联，如果所购买的大米数量不能抵偿我们所提供的物资的价值的话，那末缅甸将享有信用贷款的权利，即根据双方的协定在若干年中以实物分期支付。
    为了表示对缅甸联邦人民的善意和尊敬，我们受苏联政府的委托代表苏联政府向缅甸联邦人民建议，由苏联出人力和设备在仰光建筑和装备一所工艺学院，作为给缅甸联邦人民的礼物。
    缅甸联邦政府深深了解苏联政府提出这一建议的动机，并且怀着对苏联政府和苏联人民的深深感激之情接受了这一礼物。
    吴努总理也代表缅甸联邦人民提议赠送给苏联相应数量的大米和其他一些缅甸产品。我们代表苏联人民感激地接受了这些礼物。
    缅甸领导人以及缅甸知识界都表现出热望同苏联发展文化关系。我们表示苏联准备发展同缅甸的文化关系，因为这只会给两国带来好处，有助于进一步加强我们之间的友好关系。
    缅甸政府对苏联政府在仰光的会谈中所表现出来的善意表示满意。我们方面祝缅甸联邦尽快地消除殖民压迫和战争破坏的后果，希望缅甸人民团结一致并且在建设本国的经济中取得进一步的成就，这种经济将摆脱外国对它的控制，摆脱由于某些国家企图在国际市场上置缅甸于不利的地位而使它仍然经受着的困难。
    苏联和缅甸人民一致渴望维护和巩固和平、保证各国人民的安全、更加广泛地扩展各国人民之间的合作和友谊。我和赫鲁晓夫同志作为缅甸政府的客人访问缅甸，以及我们同缅甸人民的会晤，使苏联和缅甸更加接近了。我们两国的友谊和合作在争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中日益成为一个越来越重要的因素。
    我们将尽一切努力使我们两国的友谊和合作为了我们两国人民的利益和幸福而日益巩固和发展。
    现在谈一谈我们访问阿富汗的结果。
    我们作为阿富汗王国政府的客人访问阿富汗的意义和成果是怎样估计也不会过高的。苏联和阿富汗有着2，346公里长的共同边界，有一种悠久的、紧密的友好关系把我们联系在一起。阿富汗人民在同企图把阿富汗变为自己殖民地的英国帝国主义者的激烈斗争中获得了自己国家的独立。英勇的阿富汗人民在这个斗争中曾经三次取得胜利，而在1919年终于宣布了自己的独立和成立了自己的国家。苏维埃国家在中亚细亚击溃干涉者对阿富汗的宣布独立起了巨大的作用。
    阿富汗永远受到苏维埃国家的不变的支持。我们的国家是早在1919年就承认阿富汗是一个主权国家的第一个国家。阿富汗也是首先承认由于伟大的十月社会主义革命而建成的苏维埃国家的那些国家当中的一个。光从这些事实就可以看出：我们两国之间的良好关系是多么根深蒂固。经验证明，这种善邻关系是完全符合两国人民的切身利益的。
    我们在喀布尔同阿富汗国王穆罕默德·查希尔·沙阿陛下以及同阿富汗首相穆罕默德·达乌德汗和阿富汗其他著名国家领导人的会谈证明了，他们希望今后也保持和发展我们两国之间的善邻关系。
    对阿富汗王国政府的这种愿望我们只会表示欢迎，我们在喀布尔的时候就曾经讲到这一点。苏联政府方面曾经尽过、而且今后也要尽一切必需的努力，使我们同这个邻国的关系日趋巩固，日益发展。
    同阿富汗国家领导人交换意见的结果，表明了两国政府要求促进国际紧张局势的进一步缓和和扩大国际合作的愿望。我们满意地指出，两国政府在若干国际问题上，其中包括裁军问题以及亚洲和远东的问题，看法是一致的，这在12月18日在喀布尔市签订的苏阿联合声明中表示了出来。
    我们在喀布尔所发表的演说中，表示了我们对阿富汗人民所十分关怀的巴克同尼斯坦问题的态度。巴克同尼斯坦是阿富汗“独立部落”居住的地区。在1893年，这个地区被并入不列颠帝国，而在1947年，不顾居住在这里的部落的利益，巴克同尼斯坦被划入巴基斯坦。
    我们认为，阿富汗要求同它毗邻的巴克同尼斯坦居民有机会自由表示自己的意志是正确有理的。这个地区的人民像其他任何人民一样有民族自决权。那些不愿意考虑、并且不考虑巴克同尼斯坦人民的合法民族利益的人，是无法找到任何辩解的。
    我们同阿富汗的关系是以从阿富汗成为一个独立国家以来所缔结的一些条约作为基础的。苏联和阿富汗两国在1931年6月24日缔结的中立和互不侵犯条约在这些条约中占据着重要的地位。
    在我们访问喀布尔的时候，我们和阿富汗王国政府之间达成了协议，决定延长上述条约有效期限十年，即到1966年为止。我们商定，就是在这个期限届满以后，如果缔约双方都没有建议停止条约的效力，这个条约仍将继续有效。双方为了这个目的在喀布尔签订了专门议定书。这一行动具有重要意义，它证明双方认真地对待自己的义务，并且打算根据所缔结的条约和协定来发展彼此的关系。
    我们认为，阿富汗王国政府执行的中立和同其他国家保持善邻关系的政策有助于阿富汗国家地位的巩固。阿富汗和巴基斯坦相反，巴基斯坦由于参加巴格达军事集团而在内政和外交上陷入困难的地位，而阿富汗无疑在独立的政治和经济发展方面具有极大的可能性。
    如果巴基斯坦也能够利用这一类可能性，我们将会感到高兴。苏联希望同巴基斯坦建立同印度、缅甸和阿富汗同样的友好关系，我们同巴基斯坦直到现在还没有这种友好关系，那不是我们的过错。但是，苏联政府过去曾经、而且今后仍然将竭力改善我们同巴基斯坦的关系。
    在阿富汗，我们就我们两国经济关系和扩大经济关系的问题非常有成效地交换了意见。在同阿富汗国家领导人交谈之后，我们发现了在进一步发展两国经济合作，特别是扩大苏联和阿富汗贸易方面有着新的可能性。
    根据政府的委托，我们同意给予阿富汗一亿美元的长期贷款。
    在我们访问喀布尔期间，我们曾代表苏联政府邀请阿富汗首相穆罕默德·达乌德汗先生在他方便的时候访问苏联。穆罕默德·达乌德汗先生已经接受了我们的邀请，并表示希望在1956年访问我国。我们毫不怀疑，穆罕默德·达乌德汗先生的访问苏联也将同我和赫鲁晓夫同志访问阿富汗一样，会有助于我们两国友好关系的进一步巩固。
    自从独立的阿富汗国家成立以来的36年当中，我们同阿富汗的关系可以作为真正善邻关系和友好合作的典范。今后我们仍然希望同阿富汗保持符合两国人民利益和巩固和平利益的这种关系。
    我们希望看到阿富汗是一个经济上坚强、政治上独立的国家，并且很高兴地指出，我们对这个国家的政策得到了阿富汗王国政府和阿富汗人民的充分了解。
    代表同志们！我们同印度、缅甸和阿富汗的友好关系的加强，是苏联和平外交政策的列宁主义原则的胜利，是和平共处原则的胜利。
    大家知道，苏联、印度、缅甸和阿富汗在社会政治制度方面是不同的。但是这种情况现在不是、将来也不会是进一步加强我们各国之间的关系的障碍。这种关系的巩固基础是我已经讲过的著名的五项原则。
    苏联、中华人民共和国、印度、缅甸、阿富汗和其他一些欧洲、亚洲和非洲国家彼此之间的关系以及同其他国家之间的关系，正是建筑在这些原则之上的。我们深深地尊重这些完全符合苏联外交政策的基础的原则，并且认为，赞同这些原则并且以它们为指导方针的国家越多，国际信任就会发展得越成功，缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的事业就会前进得越快。大家知道，我们对亚洲国家的访问，在全世界特别是亚非各国引起了广泛的反应。
    我们在印度、缅甸和阿富汗的群众集会和会议上讲话的时候，表达了我国人民对这些国家人民的友谊之情，说明了我国的爱好和平的列宁主义政策。我们祝贺摆脱了殖民奴役的羁绊的人民，并且同情还在殖民主义者压迫之下的人民。赫鲁晓夫同志在各次讲话中正确地、坦率地表达了我们对帝国主义者和殖民主义者在亚洲、非洲，在他们过去统治的或者仍然统治着的一切地方的活动的观点。
    从外国的报刊上也可以看出，东方国家对我们的言论是何等地重视。有些报刊指出，没有一个资本主义世界的代表人物中敢向亚洲人民说出关于殖民国家的真相的话，敢说出这种话的只是那些捍卫着一切国家人民的平等权利、积极为世界一切国家都能自由地并且按照自己的道路发展而斗争的人。
    我们的公开、坦率的谈话不仅引起同我们直接交谈的人们的同情和同感，我们的话远远地传到印度、缅甸和阿富汗境外，亚非大陆的其他国家人民都听到了这些话。
    中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的公众同这些国家的人民一道欢迎我们这次访问的积极结果，全世界的进步人士，我们所有的朋友都赞同我们这次访问。
    但是，我们在亚洲国家的访问并不是所有的人都喜欢的。我们在印度、缅甸和阿富汗的讲话，我们在德里、仰光和喀布尔签订的友好文件，引起某些国家的反动报纸和官方代表的不满，甚至愤恨。他们不喜欢我们同印度、缅甸和阿富汗的友谊。但是我们很喜欢这种友谊，我们将像加强同其他国家的友谊和合作那样来加强这种友谊。
    我们关于殖民主义者政策的坦率的言论不合西方国家某些人士的口味。但是，我们，和亚非国家人民一样，更不喜欢殖民政策。因此，我们过去反对、今后仍然将反对这种政策，因为我们认为，殖民制度是现代人类的耻辱，是同联合国组织的爱好和平和民主的原则不相容的。
    在我们进行访问期间，西方国家里出现了这样一些言论，硬说我们访问印度、缅甸、阿富汗的目的是损害这些国家的人民同西方国家的人民之间的关系。这种论调是没有任何根据的。苏联同印度、缅甸和阿富汗的友好关系的加强，不仅丝毫不会损害这些国家的人民同其他国家的人民的关系，恰恰相反，将促进国际合作的发展。
    也许那些惯于在军事集团和军事公约的范围内思考问题的人，是不完全明白这一点的。但是我们对改善苏联同其他国家的关系这个问题采取另一种态度。印度、缅甸和阿富汗的国家领导人所持的看法同我们的相似，他们也和我们一样，主张在和平共处的原则的基础上扩大国际合作。
    代表同志们！我们访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的结果又一次说明，国家领导人之间的个人接触，是加强各国人民之间的相互了解和缓和国际紧张局势的一种多么重要的方法。我们打算今后仍然要广泛地利用这种接触。
    我想借此机会代表苏联政府和我国人民，向印度、缅甸和阿富汗的人民表示衷心的感谢，感谢他们对我们的盛情和热烈的款待。
    我们向这些国家的人民——苏联的真挚的朋友们致以热烈的敬意，并且祝他们在加强自己的民族独立和在和平的、建设性的劳动方面取得成绩。
    我们衷心地感谢印度总理尼赫鲁先生，他曾经十分关心于使我们这次的访问印度对两国都有益处。
    我们竭诚地感谢缅甸总理吴努，我们已同他建立了热情友好的关系。
    我们热烈地感谢阿富汗首相穆罕默德·达乌德汗先生，他在积极地维护阿富汗的独立和中立。
    我们认为，自己有责任向印度共和国总统普拉沙德先生、缅甸总统巴宇博士、阿富汗国王穆罕默德·查希尔·沙阿陛下表示我们的谢意。
    我们感谢这些国家的促成我们这次访问圆满成功，并且在各方面帮助我们的所有的政府人士和社会人士。
    最后，我认为必须声明：苏联政府将始终不变地和坚定地实现在这次访问期间同印度、缅甸和阿富汗达成的一切协议。
    我们要尽一切努力，来发展和加强苏联同印度、缅甸、阿富汗之间的友好和合作，以造福我们各国的人民和有益于世界和平。
      （暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声，转为欢呼。全场起立。）
