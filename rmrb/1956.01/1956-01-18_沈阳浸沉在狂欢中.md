    Shenyang Immersed in Jubilation
    Lu Wen, Fang Shi
    Following closely on the heels of the great victory of socialist transformation in the capital, Beijing, all 105 industrial and commercial sectors in Shenyang City were entirely converted to joint state-private ownership on the 15th. Over 40,000 handicraft households have essentially achieved cooperativization, and 100,000 farming households in the suburbs have joined agricultural production cooperatives. On January 16th, Shenyang City held a rally and parade of over 400,000 people, celebrating the victory of socialist transformation throughout the city.
    The tide of socialist transformation in Shenyang City is advancing with tremendous force. On January 13th, the number of private industrial and commercial households applying for joint state-private ownership was only over 3,000; on January 14th, it increased to more than 11,000; and on the 15th, all were converted to joint state-private ownership. Many industrialists and businessmen said, "Our common wish is to fully implement joint state-private ownership as early as possible, just like Beijing!" Many industrialists and businessmen who were hesitant a few days ago now clearly see the bright future of socialism. Zhang Shiyi, manager of Tianyitang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop, used to think, "Socialism is good, and the country has a future, but industrialists and businessmen have no future." Now he excitedly says, "Now I see my own future clearly. As long as I work hard, I can become a glorious self-reliant working person!" On the second day after the approval of joint state-private ownership, Tianyitang was decorated with a brand-new look, with a banner reading "Advance Towards Socialism" posted under the large gold-lettered sign. Zhou Xinquan, the 63-year-old manager of Shenyang's famous Lao Neijin Shoe Store, upon returning home after participating in the celebration parade, was greeted by a large group of grandchildren who ran up and hugged his legs, saying, "Grandpa, great joy!" Zhou Xinquan was moved to tears. Yao Chunxi, a capitalist in his 60s, also dressed up and danced the Yangko like the young people.
    Many industrialists and businessmen, overnight, took out gold ingots and gold jewelry that had been buried for many years to invest. Commercial capitalists in the Nanshi District alone invested more than 2,000 yuan.
    There are many time-honored brands in the old city of Shenyang, and the high tide of socialist transformation has changed their appearance. For example, Tongchangxing, which produces the famous "Old Train" brand toothpaste, has only made one small reform in its method of packaging toothpaste in the 43 years since the factory was built. That was in the year of Shenyang's liberation. More than seven years passed since then, and it continued to operate according to the "old ways". The advent of the high tide of socialist transformation aroused the workers' enthusiasm for improving production. They designed two simple machines that could fully mechanize the work of packaging toothpaste, increasing packaging efficiency by 40%.
    In the high tide of socialist transformation, employees of private enterprises organized more than 500 youth shock brigades to assist the public side in enterprise reorganization and production reform. They also presented outstanding production results as gifts. On the second day after applying for joint state-private ownership, six workers at Tianhe Electric Appliance Factory in Heping District completed the workload of 18 workers in 8 hours in 10 hours. Xinlu Factory in Tiexi District originally planned to produce 300 channel irons per day for the Liaoning Farm Implement Factory; after joint state-private ownership, the workers decided to increase production to 500 per day.
    On the evening of the 16th, as soon as night fell, the sound of firecrackers and drums echoed throughout the streets and alleys of Shenyang City, and people were immersed in jubilation. Many industrialists and businessmen kept setting off firecrackers. They said, "In our lives, we have set off firecrackers to welcome the God of Wealth and send off the Kitchen God countless times, but only today's firecrackers have brought us a real and bright future!"

    沈阳浸沉在狂欢中
    卢文　芳石
    紧跟着首都北京社会主义改造的伟大胜利。沈阳市105个工商业行业在15日全部实行了公私合营。4万多手工业户基本上实现了合作化，郊区10万农户参加了农业生产合作社。1月16日，沈阳市举行了40多万人的集会游行，欢庆全市社会主义改造的胜利。
    沈阳市社会主义改造的浪潮是以汹涌澎湃之势前进的。1月13日，申请公私合营的私营工商业户还不过3，000户，1月14日就增加到11，000多户，15日就全部实行了公私合营。许多工商业者说：“我们共同的愿望，是像北京那样，越早越好地全面实行公私合营！”许多工商业者几天前还犹豫不定，现在都看清了社会主义的光明前途。天益堂中药号经理张士毅，过去认为“社会主义是好，国家也有前途，但是工商业者没有前途”。现在他兴奋地说：“如今我看清了自己的前途，只要自己努力，就可以成为一个光荣的自食其力的劳动人民！”在批准公私合营的第二天，天益堂装饰得焕然一新，大金字招牌下贴着“向社会主义前进”的标语。沈阳著名的老内金鞋店的63岁的经理周心泉，在参加庆祝游行回来以后，一到家里，孙子、孙女跑上来一大堆，抱住他的大腿说：“爷爷，你大喜！”周心泉激动得老泪横流。60多岁的资本家姚春喜也化了装，同年轻人一样扭起秧歌。
    许多工商业者，连夜把埋藏多少年的金元宝、金首饰都拿出来投资，仅南市区的商业资本家就投资了2，000多元。
    沈阳旧城内有许多老字号，社会主义改造的高潮使他们改变了面貌。如生产著名的“老火车”牌牙粉的同昌行，建厂43年来，包装牙粉的方法只有一次小的改革，那是在沈阳市解放那年。以后又过了7年多，仍然一直按着“老车旧辙”办事。社会主义改造的高潮到来，激起了工人改进生产的积极性。他们设计了两个简单的机器，就可以把包装牙粉的工作全部机械化，提高包装效率40％。
    在社会主义改造的高潮中，私营企业的职工们组织了500多个青年突击队，协助公方进行企业改组和生产改革。他们并以优异的生产成绩作为献礼。和平区天和电器工厂在申请公私合营的第二天，6个工人10小时就完成了18个工人8小时的工作量。铁西区新陆工厂本来计划每天给辽宁农具厂生产300根槽铁；公私合营以后，工人决定每天提高到生产500根。
    16日晚，夜幕刚刚降临，沈阳市街头巷尾到处响起了花炮声和锣鼓声，人们浸沉在狂欢里。许多工商业者不断地放燃爆竹。他们说：“在我们的一生里，曾燃放过多少回接财神、送灶君的爆竹，但是只有今天的爆竹，才给我们带来了真正的光明前途！”
