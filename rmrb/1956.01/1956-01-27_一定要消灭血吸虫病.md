Schistosomiasis is a chronic disease that seriously endangers the health of the Chinese people. In China, due to the past reactionary rulers' disregard for the people's suffering, the epidemic areas of this disease spread across the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and 12 provinces and cities south of the Yangtze River. Approximately 10 million people suffer from this disease, and about 100 million people are directly threatened by it. Among them, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are the most severely affected provinces. This disease is most easily transmitted in rice-growing areas, with young and middle-aged people in rural areas accounting for the majority of patients. The direct result of the disease's development is not only the death of a large number of people but also the decline in the labor capacity of a large number of farmers, which seriously affects agricultural production and national defense construction.

Since liberation, the Party and the People's Government have attached great importance to the people's healthcare. The patriotic health campaign carried out nationwide has provided favorable conditions for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. Health departments at all levels have also established many schistosomiasis prevention and control organizations in schistosomiasis-prone areas. They have conducted investigations and research on schistosomiasis, trained a certain number of cadres, and treated 200,000 schistosomiasis patients. However, due to the lack of comprehensive planning for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis in epidemic areas in the past, and the absence of a determination to completely eliminate schistosomiasis, the health departments at all levels also lacked correct working guidelines for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. Preventive and therapeutic work has not formed a mass movement, useful experiences and methods have not been well summarized and promoted, scientific research work lacks unified leadership, and the strength of traditional Chinese medicine and the experience of traditional Chinese medicine in treating schistosomiasis have not been valued. As a result, the prevention and control of schistosomiasis has not been very effective, and in some areas, the disease continues to spread. This situation is very detrimental to the health of the broad masses of the people and the cause of national construction. Therefore, we must overcome the shortcomings in our past work, make plans, mobilize forces from all sides, effectively stop the spread of schistosomiasis, and ultimately eliminate schistosomiasis.

What conditions guarantee that we can eliminate schistosomiasis? These conditions are: First, the Party Central Committee and the Party committees in schistosomiasis epidemic areas have decided to directly lead this work and integrate the task of eliminating schistosomiasis with the rural cooperative movement, listing it as one of the important tasks of the local Party committees. Second, the broad masses of farmers have already been organized in the agricultural cooperative movement, and in order to safeguard their health, they will inevitably give full play to their high level of enthusiasm and creativity in the fight against schistosomiasis. Third, the Chinese scientific community has been studying schistosomiasis for more than 30 years, and the people have already gained certain experiences and achievements in the fight against schistosomiasis in recent years. From the perspective of preventive work, the laws of schistosomiasis transmission have been basically clarified. It is generally known that the treatment of human and animal feces, the elimination of snails, the management of water sources, and personal protection are several basic measures, and there are effective methods to do so. From the perspective of therapeutic work, the techniques of schistosomiasis testing, diagnosis, and treatment have been mastered by general medical personnel with relative proficiency. Antimony preparations of Western medicine have proven to have a cure rate of at least 60%, and China can produce them in large quantities, which can supply the needs of treatment; traditional Chinese medicine also has many methods for treating chronic and late-stage schistosomiasis. As long as we can make good use of these conditions, we will definitely be able to achieve the goal of eliminating schistosomiasis.

The guiding principle for eliminating schistosomiasis is: overall planning, strengthening leadership, relying on mutual assistance and cooperation, organizing the forces of both Chinese and Western medicine, actively preventing and treating the disease, and gradually eliminating it. The decisive link in implementing this guiding principle lies in effectively strengthening leadership. Party committees and governments at all levels in schistosomiasis epidemic areas should regard the elimination of schistosomiasis as a regular and important task, make a special plan for eliminating schistosomiasis, and include this plan as an integral part of the overall plan for agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production. At the same time, all localities should absorb departments and organizations such as agriculture, water conservancy, propaganda, science, health, civil affairs, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation to participate in the establishment of command organizations for schistosomiasis prevention and control, in order to mobilize forces from all sides and launch this struggle. It is necessary to use various forms, combined with various prevention and control measures, to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and education among the masses, so that the masses understand the benefits of eliminating schistosomiasis for socialist construction and for themselves, understand the methods of prevention and treatment, improve their level of scientific knowledge, and enhance their confidence and enthusiasm in preventing and controlling schistosomiasis.

The basic method for eliminating schistosomiasis should be equal emphasis on prevention and treatment. In the past, some places only paid attention to prevention and not treatment; some only paid attention to treatment and neglected prevention; or only took single measures in prevention work; or only paid attention to the treatment of early-stage patients and neglected the treatment of late-stage patients. These practices, of course, could not eliminate schistosomiasis. In the future, we should actively prevent and actively treat, and both prevention and treatment should have comprehensive measures. That is to say, in terms of prevention, we should carry out the treatment of feces, the elimination of snails, the management of water sources, and personal protection simultaneously. Prevention and treatment cannot be separated. Without paying attention to treatment, the source of infection cannot be cut off; without prevention, healthy people will continue to be infected. In terms of treatment, we should not only pay attention to the treatment of early-stage patients but also pay attention to the treatment of late-stage patients. Because curing severe cases in the late stage not only reduces the source of infection, but also greatly encourages all patients, which can greatly enhance the masses' confidence in eliminating schistosomiasis.

In the work of schistosomiasis prevention and control, we should strengthen the leadership of scientific research work, give scientific workers material support and work convenience, so that scientific research work can adapt to the needs of prevention and control work. Scientific workers should face reality and strive to research effective prevention and treatment technologies and drugs. Traditional Chinese medicine is a strong force in schistosomiasis prevention and control. In the past, some areas have used traditional Chinese medicine such as *fushui cao* (腹水草), *bianbian lian* (半边莲), *longhu cao* (龙虎草), *hulu-chongsun* (葫芦——虫笋), and *badou* (巴豆) to treat schistosomiasis, which has achieved certain results. In the future, all localities should further organize traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to participate in the prevention and control of schistosomiasis, continue to collect folk prescriptions and other treatment methods, and test and promote them according to the circumstances.

In order to strive to eliminate schistosomiasis as soon as possible, we must also strengthen preparations in all aspects. This year, all localities should thoroughly investigate the condition of schistosomiasis, train grassroots cadres in large numbers, sort out and promote existing experiences, and enrich and strengthen various prevention and control institutions. In short, we must be prepared ideologically, organizationally, and materially to create conditions for large-scale prevention and control of schistosomiasis.

    一定要消灭血吸虫病
    血吸虫病是一种对我国人民危害严重的慢性病。在我国，由于过去反动统治者不顾人民疾苦，这种病害的流行地区遍及长江中下游以及长江以南的12个省、市，大约有1，000万人患这种病，约有1万万人直接受到这种病的威胁。其中，又以江苏、浙江、安徽、湖南、湖北、江西6省最为严重。这种病害在水稻作物地区最易传染，患者以农村中的青壮年占多数。病害发展的直接结果，不仅引起大批人口的死亡，而且使大批农民的劳动能力下降，严重地影响了农业生产和国防建设。
    解放以后，党和人民政府十分重视人民的保健工作，在全国范围内开展的爱国卫生运动，给防治血吸虫病提供了有利条件。各级卫生部门也在血吸虫病流行地区建立了许多血吸虫病防治组织，对于血吸虫病进行了调查研究工作，培养了一定数量的干部，治疗了20万血吸虫病患者。但是，由于血吸虫病流行的地区过去对于防治血吸虫病缺乏全面规划，没有彻底消灭血吸虫病的决心；各级卫生部门对防治血吸虫病也缺乏正确的工作方针，预防和治疗工作没有形成群众性的运动，有用的经验和方法没有很好地总结和推广，科学研究工作缺乏统一领导，中医力量以及中医治疗血吸虫病的经验没有被重视，以致血吸虫病的防治工作收效不大，在某些地区，病情仍然继续蔓延。这种状况对于广大人民的健康和国家建设事业是非常不利的。因此，必须克服过去工作中的缺点，作出规划，动员各方面的力量，有效地制止血吸虫病的蔓延，最后要消灭血吸虫病。
    有些什么条件保证我们能够消灭血吸虫病呢？这些条件是：第一、党中央和血吸虫病流行地区的党委已经决定直接领导这个工作，并且把消灭血吸虫病的任务和农村合作化运动结合起来，列为地方党委的重要工作之一。第二、广大的农民群众在农业合作化运动中，已经组织起来，他们为了维护自己的健康，必然发挥高度的积极性和创造性，同血吸虫病作斗争。第三、中国科学界研究血吸虫病已有了30年以上的历史，人民群众在最近几年同血吸虫病进行斗争已经有了一定的经验和成就。从预防工作上说，对于血吸虫病的传染规律已经基本上明了；大体上知道了处理人畜粪便、消灭钉螺、管理水源和人体防护是几项基本措施，而且有了行之有效的办法。从治疗工作上说，血吸虫病的检验、诊断、施治等技术已经为一般医务人员比较熟练地掌握了。西药的锑制剂，证明至少有60％以上的治愈率，而且我国能够大量地生产，可以供应治疗上的需要；中医也有许多治疗慢性的晚期的血吸虫病的办法。只要能够很好地利用这些条件，就一定能够达到消灭血吸虫病的目的。
    消灭血吸虫病的方针是：全面规划，加强领导，依靠互助合作，组织中西医力量，积极防治，逐步消灭。贯彻执行这一方针的决定性环节，在于切实加强领导。血吸虫病流行区的各级党委和政府，应当把消灭血吸虫病作为一项经常的重要工作，对于消灭血吸虫病要作出专门的规划，并且把这个规划作为农业合作化和农业生产全面规划的一个组成部分。同时，各地应该吸收农业、水利、宣传、科学、卫生、民政、工会、青年团、妇联等部门和组织参加组成防治血吸虫病的指挥机构，以便动员各方面的力量，展开这一斗争。要运用各种形式，结合各种防治措施，向群众广泛地深入地进行宣传教育，使群众了解消灭血吸虫病对社会主义建设和对自己的好处，了解预防和治疗的办法，提高科学知识水平，增强对防治血吸虫病的信心和积极性。
    消灭血吸虫病的基本方法应该是预防和治疗并重。过去有的地方只注意预防，不注意治疗；有的只注意治疗，忽视了预防；或者在预防工作中只采取单一的措施；或者只注意早期病人的治疗，忽视晚期病人的治疗，这些作法当然不可能消灭血吸虫病。今后应该既要积极预防又要积极治疗，预防和治疗都要有全面的综合性的措施。就是说，在预防方面应该把处理粪便、消灭钉螺、管理水源以及个人防护几项办法，同时配合进行。预防和治疗是不能分割的，不注意治疗，就不能断绝病源；不进行预防，就会继续使健康的人受到感染。在治疗方面，不但应该注意对早期病人的治疗，也应该重视对晚期病人的治疗。因为把晚期的重症治好了，不但减少了传染病源，而且对于一切患者都是一个极大的鼓舞，可以大大提高群众消灭血吸虫病的信心。
    在防治血吸虫病的工作中，应该加强对于科学研究工作的领导，给科学工作者以物质上的支持和工作上的便利，使科学研究工作能够适应防治工作的需要。科学工作者应当面向实际，努力研究有效的预防和治疗的技术和药物。中医在防治血吸虫病工作中是一支强大的力量，过去某些地区运用中药腹水草、半边莲、龙虎草、葫芦——虫笋、巴豆等治疗血吸虫病，已经收到一定的效果；今后各地应该进一步组织中医参加血吸虫病的防治工作，继续搜集民间的单方和其他治疗方法，分别情况加以试验和推广。
    为了争取尽快地消灭血吸虫病，还必须加强各方面的准备工作。今年内各地应该把血吸虫病的病情彻底调查清楚，大量训练基层干部，整理和推广已有的经验，充实和加强各种防治机构。总之，要从思想上、组织上、物质上作好准备，为大规模地防治血吸虫病创造条件。
