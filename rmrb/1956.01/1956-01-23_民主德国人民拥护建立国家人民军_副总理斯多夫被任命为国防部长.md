Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 22nd: According to a Deutsche Press Agency report, the Senate of the German Democratic Republic unanimously passed the law on the establishment of the National People's Army and the Ministry of National Defense on January 20th.

After the People's Chamber passed the law on the establishment of the army on January 18th, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Stoph, was appointed Minister of National Defense on January 19th.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 21st: Mass organizations and the people of the German Democratic Republic warmly support the law on the establishment of the National People's Army passed by the People's Chamber on the 18th.

The Federation of Free German Trade Unions issued a statement saying that the law on the establishment of the National People's Army is fully in line with the wishes of workers, office workers, and intellectuals of the republic to protect the political, economic, and cultural achievements of the working people from any infringement. Since West Germany is restoring the Wehrmacht under the leadership of American generals, it has become even more necessary to establish the National People's Army. This is in the interests of peace.

The leading body of the Berlin branch of the Free German Youth League emphasized that this decision is fully in line with the demands of the youth, who are willing to defend the achievements of this worker-peasant state from any imperialist aggression.

Many miners, apprentices, and young workers at the Mansfeld copper mine in the Halle district have decided to support the new law on the establishment of the National People's Army by volunteering to join the army. An apprentice at a steel plant in Leipzig said: "Because of the Second World War, I lost my parents and my home. Now I volunteer to join the People's Army so that this kind of misfortune will never happen again, and to protect our achievements."

    民主德国人民拥护建立国家人民军
    副总理斯多夫被任命为国防部长
    据新华社柏林22日电　据德意志通讯社消息：德意志民主共和国参议院在1月20日一致通过了关于建立国家人民军和国防部的法律。
    在人民议院1月18日通过关于建军的法律以后，德意志民主共和国副总理斯多夫已经在1月19日被任命为国防部部长。
    据新华社柏林21日电　民主德国的群众组织和人民热烈拥护人民议院18日通过的关于建立国家人民军的法律。
    自由德国工会联合会发表声明说，建立国家人民军的法律是完全符合共和国工人、机关工作者和知识分子要求保护劳动人民的政治、经济和文化成就不受任何侵犯的愿望的。由于西德正在美国将军们的领导下恢复国防军，因此建立国家人民军就变得更加必要。这样作是符合和平的利益的。
    自由德国青年联盟柏林支部的领导机构着重指出，这个决定是完全符合青年的要求的，他们愿意保卫这个工农国家的成就，以免遭受任何帝国主义的侵犯。
    哈雷专区曼斯菲尔德铜矿的许多矿工、徒工和青年工人已经决定用志愿参加军队的行动来支持关于建立国家人民军的新法律。来比锡钢铁厂的一个徒工说：“由于第二次世界大战，我失去了我的双亲和我的家。现在我志愿参加人民军，以便使这一类的不幸永远不再发生，同时维护我们的成就。”
