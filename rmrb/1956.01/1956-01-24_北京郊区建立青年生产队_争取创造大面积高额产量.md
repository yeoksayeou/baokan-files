    北京郊区建立青年生产队
    争取创造大面积高额产量
    据新华社23日讯　北京郊区农业生产合作社的青年社员们已经建立了一百个青年生产队，向争取高额产量进军。还有350个青年生产队已经酝酿成熟，不久也要建立。
    许多青年生产队向所在的农业生产合作社承担了创造大面积高产量的任务。红星集体农庄的青年生产队已经接受了一千亩棉花每亩收摘籽棉一千斤的任务。金星农业生产合作社青年生产队队员表示，决心克服一切困难，在一千亩稻田里每亩收获一千斤水稻。东冉村乡四季青农业生产合作社的青年生产队计划种白菜50亩，每亩产35，000斤。
    为了实现这些增产指标，不少青年生产队订出了技术保证措施。
