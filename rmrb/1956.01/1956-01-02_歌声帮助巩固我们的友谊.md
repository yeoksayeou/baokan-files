Singing Helps Consolidate Our Friendship
People's Actor of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, Stalin Prize Winner, Lashid Peibuto Fu

    We often say in our folk tradition: songs can sing out people's hearts. When I participated in the Soviet Art Troupe's visit to People's China in 1952, I felt this particularly strongly once again. At that time, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month was held, and we visited many cities in your country. As a singer, I was primarily interested in the people's creations.

    Even now, I still remember our friendly meeting. "The Soviet and Chinese people are always brothers." - How enthusiastically thousands of voices shouted this sentence in unison at a large stadium in Guangzhou. People gazed at us, the cultural envoys of the Soviet country. At the same time, one could feel that not only words, but also the hearts of the Chinese people seemed to be making a sacred vow: "Comrades, we are always with you!" The song of friendship floated over the ocean of people, as if the whole world was listening to this song.

    My dear friends, I am very happy to meet you again, although in the form of correspondence, in the newspaper.

    As the New Year approaches, it is customary to look back on the past and look forward to the future. Now let me talk about myself.

    An actor's happiness lies in creative labor, in serving the people. After traveling to your country, I participated in the filming of the musical film "Dedicated to the Dear People." I have also acted in films depicting offshore oil workers.

    Ten years ago, the film "The Peddler and the Miss" helped me embark on the path of great art. The popularity of this comedy completely exceeded the original expectations. Comrades jokingly called me Lashid Mar Alan (the name of the male lead in "The Peddler and the Miss"). Now, at the Azerbaijan Film Studio, the musical film "The Happiest Day" is about to be completed, and I play the leading role in this film. Audiences and listeners say that this role is played successfully. At the same time, I hope to hear your opinions as well.

    I remember the first few months of 1953 very clearly, when I had just returned from China. I became a welcome guest everywhere. Whether it was students or white-haired old people, they were all interested in the question: how do the Chinese brothers live, work and rest? I must be asked to sing. The Soviet people love songs very much. They vividly express everything that moves them and that they desire in songs. So I sang songs such as "In That Distant Place" and "People of the World, One Heart." I also sang "The Peddler and the Miss" in Chinese.

    I also talked about how people danced the popular "Yangko Dance" to the accompaniment of small drums and cymbals, wearing strange masks, and how we were fascinated by the opera "The White-Haired Girl" and the Yue Opera "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai." "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" is very similar to the Azerbaijani opera "Leyli and Majnun," both of which describe the love and death of two young hearts.

    The trip to China gave me a lot, although what I came into contact with was perhaps only one ten-thousandth of your excellent art treasure. And when my friend listened to the gramophone record of Chinese folk songs and said to me: "Lashid, you sing like a Chinese person!" I felt indescribable joy.

    Last year, I sang with the Chinese female singer Zhou Xiaoyan on the stage of the Baku Green Stadium. What a strange power song has! It is like a strong bond that strengthens friendship and brings people closer together in the struggle for peace. Dear friends, in parting, I want to say to you: I cherish the warmth of the friendly handshake that Comrade Mao Zedong gave me on the eve of the October Revolution in Beijing, and I regard it as a symbol of the sacred friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

　　歌声帮助巩固我们的友谊
　　阿塞拜疆苏维埃社会主义共和国人民演员  斯大林奖金获得者  拉希德·裴布托夫
    我们民间常说：歌能唱出人的心意。当我在1952年参加苏联艺术工作团访问人民中国的时候，我再一次特别强烈地感觉到了这一点。那时举行了中苏友好月，我们访问了你们国家的许多城市。我，作为一名歌手，首先感到兴趣的就是人民的创作。
    直到现在，我还记得我们的友谊的会见。“苏联人和中国人永远是兄弟。”——在广州市一个大运动场上，几千人的声音是多么热情地齐声喊出了这句话。人们注视着我们、苏维埃国家的文化使者。同时可以感到，不仅是言语，而且中国人的心仿佛也在发出神圣的誓言：“同志们我们同你们永远在一起！”友谊的歌声在人群的海洋上飘荡，似乎全世界都在倾听这歌声。
    我的亲爱的朋友们，我很高兴又同你们会见了，虽然是用通信的方式，是在报纸上。
    在新年来到的时候，照例要回顾过去，瞻望将来。现在谈谈我自己。
    一个演员的幸福，就在于创造性的劳动，在于为人民服务。在去你们那里旅行了一趟以后，我曾参加拍演音乐片“献给亲爱的人民”。我也演过描写海上石油工人的影片。
    十年以前，影片“货郎与小姐”帮助我走上了伟大艺术的道路。这个喜剧受欢迎的情形完全超出了原来的期望。同志们开玩笑地把我叫做拉希德·马尔·阿兰（“货郎与小姐”中男主角的名字）。现在在阿塞拜疆电影制片厂，音乐片“最幸福的日子”即将摄制完成，我在这部影片中扮演主角。观众和听众都说这个角色演得成功。同时我希望也听到你们的意见。
    1953年头几个月的情形我记得还很清楚，那时我刚从中国回来。我到处都成了受欢迎的客人。无论是学生们或白发苍苍的老年人，都对这个问题感到兴趣：中国兄弟是怎样生活、劳动和休息的。一定要请我唱歌。苏联人民很喜欢歌曲。他们把使他们感动的和他们所热望的一切都用歌曲鲜明地表达出来。于是我唱了“在那遥远的地方”和“全世界人民心一条”等歌曲。我还用中国话唱了“货郎与小姐”这支歌。
    我还谈到人们怎样在小鼓和铜钹的伴奏下戴着奇异的面具跳流行的“秧歌舞”，谈到我们怎样被歌剧“白毛女”和越剧“梁山伯与祝英台”迷住了。“梁山伯与祝英台”很像阿塞拜疆的歌剧“雷利和梅芝侬”都是描述两颗年轻的心的爱恋和死亡的。
    中国之行使我得到了很多东西，虽然我所接触到的也许只是你们优秀艺术宝库中的千万分之一。而当我的朋友听了中国民歌的留声片以后向我说：“拉希德，你唱的跟中国人一样！”的时候，我感到了难以形容的快乐。
    去年我同中国的女歌唱家周小燕在巴库绿色运动场的台上一起唱了歌。歌声有着多么奇异的力量啊！它像强有力的纽带使友谊更加巩固，使人民在争取和平的斗争中更加亲近。亲爱的朋友们，在告别的时候我要向你们说：我珍爱着在北京的时候毛泽东同志在十月革命节前夕对我的友谊握手所留下的温暖，我把它看作是中苏两国人民的神圣友谊的象征。
