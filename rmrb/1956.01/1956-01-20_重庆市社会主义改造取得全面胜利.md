Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 19th: Chongqing has entered socialist society on the 18th. The city's socialist transformation tasks for the first Five-Year Plan have been completed one and a half to two years ahead of the original plan.

In recent days, more than 300,000 people in this mountain city have participated in celebrations and parades, with firecrackers and drums resounding day and night. The people of the city are celebrating wildly for entering socialist society.

Currently, the city's workers, peasants, industrialists, businessmen, and handicraftsmen are fully arranging production and management, and continuing to move towards the socialist road. The employees and industrialists and businessmen of the newly joint factories and shops have put forward the slogan of "Performing meritorious service for socialism." They are actively engaged in production and management, while also carrying out work such as asset verification and economic reorganization. The asset verification, personnel arrangements, and commercial network adjustments of the six joint state-private shops in the first batch of joint state-private enterprises this year, including cotton cloth, cultural supplies, hardware, and petroleum industries, have been completed.

The mass socialist transformation movement in the city gradually entered its climax after the five districts in the suburbs basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperation in mid-December last year. Recently, due to the accelerated pace of agricultural cooperation in Sichuan and the tremendous influence of the great victory of Beijing's socialist transformation work, the climax of Chongqing's socialist transformation reached its peak. The agricultural producers' cooperatives in the five districts of the city's suburbs have all been transformed into advanced cooperatives. From January 11th to 14th, within four days, all 14,000 private industrial and commercial households in 42 industries in the city had transitioned to the advanced form of state capitalism - joint state-private ownership. At the same time, handicraftsmen across the city gathered and went to the competent departments in groups to request joining handicrafts production cooperatives. In less than four days, the city completed the work of handicrafts cooperation.

    重庆市社会主义改造取得全面胜利
    据新华社重庆19日电　重庆市已经在18日进入社会主义社会，全市第一个五年计划的社会主义改造任务分别比原规划提前一年半到两年完成了。
    连日来，这个山城先后有三十多万人参加庆祝、游行，鞭炮声、锣鼓声日夜不绝。全市的人民都为了进入社会主义社会而狂欢。
    目前全市工人、农民和工商业者、手工业者正在全力安排生产、经营，继续向社会主义道路迈进。新合营的工厂和商店的职工们和工商业者，纷纷提出了“为社会主义立功”的口号。他们正在一面积极进行生产、经营，一面进行清产核资、经济改组等工作。今年第一批实行公私合营的棉布、文化用品、五金、石油等四个行业的六个公私合营商店的清产核资、人事安排、商业网调整等工作已经进行完毕。
    全市的群众性的社会主义改造运动，是在去年12月中旬全市五个区基本实现半社会主义性质的农业合作化以后，开始逐步进入高潮。最近由于四川农业合作化的速度加快以及北京市社会主义改造工作取得伟大胜利的巨大影响，重庆市社会主义改造高潮达到顶点。市郊五个区的农业生产合作社已经全部转为高级社。从1月11日到14日的4天内，全市42个行业14，000多户私营工商业户，就已经全部过渡到国家资本主义的高级形式——公私合营。同时，全市手工业者也纷纷集会，成群结队地到主管部门要求加入手工业生产合作社。在不到四天的时间内，全市就完成了手工业合作化工作。
