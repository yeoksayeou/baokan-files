　　From Ulan Bator to Erlian
　　By Our Correspondent Liu Heng

　　On December 29, 1955, I accompanied the Chinese government delegation headed by Comrade Teng Daiyuan to Ulan Bator to attend the opening ceremony of the Ulan Bator-Jining through train service.

　　Sitting in the airplane, it was like traveling over the Ulan Bator-Jining railway. Looking down from the airplane window, the railway often appeared like a straight ribbon below the plane. In modern transportation, air routes are the shortest. This "Road of Friendship" built under the air route can connect Europe and Asia with a shorter distance.

　　We arrived in Ulan Bator a little after 1 p.m. Before the 1921 revolution, Ulan Bator consisted only of small earthen houses, dilapidated tents, ancient Lama temples, and winding, dirty alleys. But now, what appears before us is a brand-new city with wide asphalt roads and rows of tall buildings. Just a few days ago, this new city of peace had announced to the world the good news of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Mongolian People's Republic and the Republic of India, and then enthusiastically welcomed the visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl. Now, it is celebrating the opening of the "Road of Friendship" with great joy.

　　On the afternoon of December 31, a through train service ceremony attended by more than 20,000 people was held in Ulan Bator’s station square. People crowded along both sides of the railway, watching a long line of freight cars decorated with portraits of Tsedenbal, Bulganin, and Mao Zedong, passing slowly through the red gate inscribed with the golden words "Road of Friendship," heading south. Everyone couldn't help but recall the day in November 1949 when people gathered here to welcome a decorated train from Moscow. The railway from Moscow to Ulan Bator has been extended southward and can now reach the heart of our country—Beijing. This railway, with a total length of more than 1,100 kilometers in Mongolia, is of great significance to the political, economic, and cultural development of the Mongolian People's Republic and the growth of the working class.

　　On the morning of January 2nd of this year, a beautiful and comfortable special train took us south, preparing to hold a rail-joining ceremony at the Mongolian-Chinese border. Not long after leaving the station, we saw a narrow-gauge railway leading to the Nalaikh Coal Mine. This was the first railway built in Mongolia. Before the revolution, Mongolia's transportation tools were cattle and camels. After the revolution, with the help of the Soviet Union, automobile transportation began in 1925, and train transportation began in 1938. Now, there are tens of thousands of kilometers of highways and more than 1,000 kilometers of railways in the country. The Nalaikh Coal Mine has increased its annual coal production from several thousand tons to more than 540,000 tons.

　　The train passed through the Ulaan Uul mountain range, the Khentii Mountains, and sped across the boundless white plains, with tall and elegant stations, houses, and schools appearing from time to time along the route. These were all built with the help of Soviet builders. Soviet builders operated a large number of bulldozers, ballast distributors, stone crushers, and a track-laying machine designed by the famous engineer Platov, laying 713 kilometers of the "Road of Friendship" within Mongolia. They also helped Mongolia and our country train a large number of railway workers. When mentioning these things, the Mongolian people are endlessly grateful. Many people named their children "Russian." An old herdsman even played the Morin Khuur and composed a song praising the "Road of Friendship":

　　“The railway is hundreds of kilometers long,
　　The steel rails shine like琴弦.
　　The train speeds on it to the distance,
　　The desert and severe cold can not defeat the road builders.
　　Storms and blizzards crawl at their feet,
　　Everything gives way to friendship and merit!”

　　Along the way, we saw many temporary houses made of old train carriages parked at the stations. They can be moved back and forth on the railway, making them very suitable for road construction workers to live in. Comrade Zhang Jingzhi, a member of the Chinese government delegation, said: "When we go back, we must also make use of old train carriages and use them as temporary houses, which can save a lot of construction sheds."

　　We arrived at Zuun-Urt station a little after 4 p.m. Zuun-Urt is the name of a temple, just like Ondor Sum in the Jining-Erlian line, it also has old and new versions. Before the revolution, Zuun-Urt only had a temple. After the revolution, there were houses and residents. When the railway was built, the station thirty or forty kilometers away from Zuun-Urt became a lively small town. Everyone called this New Zuun-Urt, and called the Zuun-Urt with the temple Old Zuun-Urt. Comrade Deleg (Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Mongolian "Truth Daily") in the same car said with emotion: "New Zuun-Urt is newly built for the temple, but compared to the station, it has become old. Everything changes so fast! The winter before last, when I came here, I woke up in the morning and saw wild hare footprints in the snow. The wild hares wanted to come and see their nests, but they didn't expect them to be occupied by people! The environment changes so fast that even wild animals don't have time to hide."

　　We arrived at Sainshand (meaning "benevolent spring" in Mongolian), the capital of Dornogovi Province, a little after 11 p.m. Sainshand was also a city established after the revolution. After the railway was built, new large canteens, schools, nurseries, etc. were built, which is much more lively than before. In the past, the power supply here was insufficient, and the lights were sometimes bright and sometimes dim. Now, the power station here has been expanded, and the bright electric lights shine on the snow like daylight. In the past, the wells here were very shallow and there was very little water. People said: "Working here for a year or two will turn your hair white." Now, the Soviet elder brother has opened a deep well with machines, and there is already an endless source of friendship here.

　　When the people of Sainshand heard that the Mongolian, Soviet, and Chinese government delegations were coming soon, they refused to sleep. They carried red flags, banners, and portraits of leaders, and ran to the station to hold a celebration. When Comrade Teng Daiyuan shouted the slogan "Long live the unbreakable friendship of China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia," a chorus of "Long live" in Chinese suddenly rang out in the crowd. It turned out that this was a group of Chinese workers who had been working and studying here with Soviet and Mongolian workers for several months. In October 1954, when the "Road of Friendship" was under intense construction, the Chinese Ministry of Railways organized a railway engineering study group to study at the Soviet 505 Engineering Bureau, which was responsible for constructing the "Road of Friendship" in Mongolia, for 3 months. The enthusiastic guidance and deep friendship of many engineers such as Milushnichkin and Plorzensky will forever remain in the hearts of Chinese railway workers.

　　On the early morning of January 3, we arrived at the border of the Mongolian People's Republic—Zamiin-Uud. Zamiin-Uud, like Erlian in our country, is a station built on barren land. The two places can be seen from a distance. At 10 a.m., the rail-joining ceremony was held on the square between the Zamiin-Uud and Erlian stations on the Mongolian-Chinese border. When Premier Tsedenbal and Vice Premier Ulanhu tightened the last bolt on the track, when Premier Tsedenbal and Vice Premier Ulanhu cut the red ribbon on the colored gate, when a train full of Hungarian trucks and Soviet and German Democratic Republic machinery came from the north, and a train full of Chinese rice and rapeseed came from the south, people smiled, danced, and applauded and cheered. The premiers and the heads of the government delegations of China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia shook hands warmly to congratulate each other and shouted "Hurrah! Long live!"

　　A little after 8 p.m., we left Erlian. The train carried us quickly forward on the Jining-Erlian line. Outside the window, it was already dark, and even the sky and the earth could not be distinguished. The lights at the stations, like bright eyes, were warmly welcoming international friends from the Soviet Union and Mongolia.

    从乌兰巴托到二连
    本报记者　刘衡
    1955年12月29日，我跟以滕代远同志为首的我国政府代表团到乌兰巴托去参加乌兰巴托—集宁的通车联运典礼。
    坐在飞机上，就像在集宁—乌兰巴托铁路的上空旅行一样。从飞机的窗口往下看，常常可以看见铁路像根笔直的带子，在飞机的下方出现。在近代交通中，飞机的航线是最短的了。在飞机航线下边建立的这条“友谊之路”可以把欧洲和亚洲用较短的距离连结起来。
    下午1点多钟，我们到了乌兰巴托。乌兰巴托，在1921年革命以前，这里只有矮小的土屋，破旧的篷帐，古老的喇嘛庙，和弯曲、肮脏的小巷子。可是，现在出现在我们面前的是一座有一条条宽大柏油路和一排排高大建筑物的崭新的城市。几天以前，这座和平的新城市曾经向全世界宣布了蒙古人民共和国同印度共和国建立外交关系的喜讯，接着又以极大的热情迎接了以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团的访问。现在，它又以极大的欢乐庆祝了“友谊之路”的通车联运。
    12月31日下午，在乌兰巴托车站广场上召开了两万多人参加的通车联运典礼。人们挤在铁路两旁，看着一长列挂着泽登巴尔、布尔加宁、毛泽东画像的货车，通过写着“友谊之路”金字的红门，慢慢向南开去。大家不禁想起在1949年11月的一天，人们曾在这里迎接一列挂彩的从莫斯科开来的火车。莫斯科到乌兰巴托的铁路向南延长了，一直可以通向我国的心脏——北京。这条铁路在蒙古境内全长1，100多公里，对蒙古人民共和国政治、经济、文化的发展、工人阶级的成长，都有很大的意义。
    今年1月2日上午，一列漂亮、舒适的专车载着我们往南走，准备到蒙、中边境举行接轨典礼。出车站不久，我们看见了一条通向那赖哈煤矿的窄轨铁路。这是在蒙古建立的第一条铁路。在革命以前，蒙古的运输工具是牛和骆驼。革命以后，在苏联帮助下，1925年开始有了汽车运输，1938年开始有了火车运输。现在，全国公路有几万公里，铁路已有1，000多公里长了。那赖哈煤矿已经由年产煤几千吨增加到54万多吨。
    火车穿过乌兰乌尔山岭、肯特山脉，在无边的白色平原上飞跑，沿线不时出现白色、黄色的高大、雅致的车站，住房和学校等等。这些都是苏联的建筑者们帮助修建的。苏联的建筑者们开动大批掘土机、撒碴机、碎石机，和有名的工程师普拉托夫设计的铺轨机，把“友谊之路”在蒙古境内铺了713公里。还帮助蒙古和我国培养了大批铁路职工。一提起这些，蒙古人民个个感谢不尽。许多人给自己的小孩起名叫“俄罗斯”。有一位老牧民还弹起马头琴，编了一首歌颂“友谊之路”的歌：
    “铁路有几百公里长，
    钢轨像琴弦一样闪闪发光。
    列车在上面向远方飞奔，
    沙漠和严寒难不倒修路的人。
    暴风和暴雪在他们脚下匐伏，
    一切都为友谊和功绩让路！”
    一路上，我们看见车站上停留着许多用旧车皮做的临时房子，它们可以在铁路上来回移动，很适宜于修路工人居住。我国政府代表团团员张静之同志说：“我们回去也要把旧车皮利用起来，用它做临时房屋，可以节省许多工棚。”
    下午4点多钟，我们到了秋依林车站。秋依林是一个庙的名字，就像集二线上的温都尔庙一样，它也有新旧两个。革命以前，秋依林只有一个庙。革命后，才有了房屋、居民。等到修了铁路，离秋依林三、四十公里的车站就变成热闹的小镇。大家把这叫做新秋依林，把有庙的秋依林叫做旧秋依林。同车的德勒格同志（蒙古“真理报”副总编辑）感慨地说：“新秋依林对庙来说，是新建的，可是比起车站，它就变成旧的了。一切变得太快了！前年冬天，我到这儿，早晨起来，还看见雪地里有野兔的脚印，野兔想来看看自己的窝，没想到被人们占去了！环境变得太快，连野兽都来不及躲开。”
    我们到达东戈壁省省会赛音山达（蒙语“仁爱的泉源”之意），已经是夜里11点多钟。赛音山达也是革命后才建立的城市。在修了铁路后，新建了大食堂、学校、托儿所等，比前热闹多了。以前，这儿的电力供应不足，电灯时明时暗。现在，这儿扩大了发电站，明亮亮的电灯光在雪地里一照，就像白天一样。以前，这儿的水井很浅，水很少。人们说：“在这儿工作一两年，头发都要发白”。现在，苏联老大哥用机器开了一眼深水井，这儿已经有了流不尽的友谊的泉源了。
    赛音山达的人们听说蒙、苏、中政府代表团快要过来，都不肯睡觉。他们扛着红旗、标语和领袖像，跑到车站开庆祝会。当滕代远同志高呼：“中、苏、蒙三国牢不可破的友谊万岁”的口号的时候，人群里忽然响起了一片用中国话喊的“万岁”的声音。原来这是一群中国工人，他们已在这儿跟苏、蒙工人一块工作、学习好几个月了。1954年10月，当“友谊之路”正在紧张修建的时候，我国铁道部曾经组织铁路工程学习团，到负责修筑蒙古境内“友谊之路”的苏联505工程局学习3个月。米路史尼勤克、普洛仁斯基等许多工程师热情的教导、深厚的友谊，永远留在我国铁路职工的心里。
    1月3日清早，我们来到蒙古人民共和国的边境——扎门乌德。扎门乌德跟我国的二连一样，是在不毛之地建立起来的车站。两地可以遥遥相望。上午10点钟，接轨典礼在蒙、中边境——扎门乌德、二连车站之间的广场上进行。当泽登巴尔总理、乌兰夫副总理拧紧铁轨上的最后一颗螺丝钉，当泽登巴尔总理、乌兰夫副总理剪去彩门上的红带，当一列满载匈牙利大卡车和苏联、民主德国的机器的货车从北方开过去，一列满载中国大米、菜籽的货车从南方开过来的时候，人们都笑着，跳着，鼓掌欢呼。总理们，中、苏、蒙三国政府代表团团长们都热烈地握手祝贺，高呼“乌拉！万岁！”
    夜里8点多钟，我们离开二连。火车载着我们在集二线上飞快前进。窗外已经是一片黑咕?咚，连天地都分不清。车站上点点灯火，像是明亮的眼睛，在热烈地欢迎来自苏、蒙的国际友人。
