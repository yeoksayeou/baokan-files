    What I Saw in the Zhejiang Countryside
    Liang Xi, Delegate to the National People's Congress
    From Xindeng through Tonglu, Jiande, Lanxi, Jinhua, Qu County to Kaihua, the landscape across these seven counties and hundreds of miles remains the same, but the relations of production in the countryside have undergone drastic changes. The living standards, cultural levels, and ideological conditions of tens of thousands of farmers have also changed significantly. Backward villages have moved forward, illiteracy has been reduced, surplus grain households have replaced grain-deficient households, and free love has replaced arranged marriages. The countryside of New China can truly be described as "the flowers bloom the same each year, but the people change year after year."

    100 Jin of Cotton, 1000 Jin of Rice, 10,000 Jin of Sweet Potatoes

    From 1954 to 1955, Zhejiang Province's total grain output increased from over 14,190 million jin to over 15,270 million jin. Cotton production increased from over 458,000 dan to over 707,000 dan. Ramie production increased from 1,462,000 dan to 2,615,000 dan. In Cixi County, 4 townships already have over 29,000 mu of cotton fields that have become "100-jin cotton fields," with an average yield of over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Yuyao and Yinxian counties already have two-tenths of their double-cropping rice fields become "1000-jin rice fields," with an average yield of over 1000 jin of rice per mu. Yuyao, Cixi, Dinghai, and other counties have already seen "10,000-jin sweet potato fields," meaning an average yield of over 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. From this, it can be seen that Zhejiang's agricultural production still has great potential. With the development of cooperativization, better and more agricultural products will surely be produced on a larger scale soon.

    Chairman Mao said: "The development of our cooperativization is healthy and can basically guarantee increased production and avoid decreased production." The following facts are vivid examples. According to statistics from 2,060 cooperatives in Xindeng, Fuyang, Changhua, Fenshui, Suichang, Chunan, and Tonglu counties, 93.8% of the cooperatives increased production. According to statistics from 331 cooperatives in Jiande County, 89% of the cooperatives increased production, and 5.4% maintained the 1954 level. Increased production has encouraged the transformation of elementary cooperatives into advanced cooperatives. The members of the Qianhe Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ankou Township, Jiande County, seeing that increased production was the result of labor, voluntarily abolished land dividends and transformed the elementary cooperative into an advanced cooperative.

    The Great Peasants Overcame Natural Disasters

    The floods in Jinhua and Jiande Special Districts in June 1955 were said to be the largest in 400 years. In several county towns, the floodwaters rose to the upper floors of buildings, even reaching the rooftops. Jiande Special District had eight disaster-stricken counties, three of which were severely affected, with over 340,000 victims and over 420,000 mu of disaster-stricken farmland. Jinhua Special District had eight disaster-stricken counties, three of which were severely affected, with over 500,000 victims and over 970,000 mu of disaster-stricken farmland. The magnitude of the floods was astonishing.

    However, the strength of the peasants' struggle was also astonishing. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, hundreds of thousands of disaster victims shouted a slogan: "Self-reliance through production!" More than a million peasants in non-disaster areas launched a movement: "Patriotic increase in production." The great peasants overcame the natural disasters. Jiande Special District increased grain production by 8.8% in 1955 compared to the previous year, and Jinhua Special District increased grain production by 6.7% in 1955 compared to the previous year.

    The peasants, advancing along the socialist road, have extremely high production enthusiasm. Some use collective strength to build water conservancy projects. For example, in Zhuji, 280,000 laborers built the Dongbai Canal in 8 months, eliminating drought and flood disasters for over 40,000 mu of cultivated land. In Jinhua, one cooperative used more than 20 waterwheels to lift water over a mountain to fight drought. In Jiande Special District, more than 1 million people built more than 17,000 water conservancy projects, benefiting an area of over 554,000 mu. Some use collective strength to control pests. For example, in Jiande Special District, two pest infestations occurred in July and August 1955, affecting over 540,000 mu of rice fields, with severe infestations affecting over 260,000 mu, but the pests were ultimately eradicated by the masses.

    The peasants have not only learned to improve the soil but have also learned to improve production techniques and change farming systems. In the mountainous areas, the farming systems in Fuyang, Xindeng, and Tonglu counties have also undergone great changes, with single-season rice being converted to double-season rice on over 34,000 mu, mid-season rice being converted to late-season rice on over 67,000 mu, low-yield crops being converted to high-yield crops on over 37,000 mu, and dry land being converted to paddy fields on over 12,000 mu.

    "The Other Foot on the Socialist Road"

    The main reason for the bumper harvest in agriculture is, of course, the enormous strength of the peasant masses (especially the cooperatives), but the timely support of the government has also played a significant role. In Jiande Special District alone, state banks provided loans of over 2.19 million yuan, credit cooperatives provided loans of over 1.46 million yuan, and the value of state-supplied means of production (including fertilizer) was over 3.43 million yuan. The combination of material resources, financial resources, and human resources created the great harvest of 1955. The peasants thank the Party and the government. Xu Lianxing, a poor peasant from the Qianhe Cooperative in Ankou Township, Jiande County, said: "Chairman Mao not only told us the direction of the socialist road but also gave us the travel expenses for the socialist road."

    The peasant masses have received the care of the Party and the government, met their needs in production and life, and everyone feels warm. From this warmth, love naturally arises: love for the cooperative, love for the village, and love for the country. They know that national industrialization needs grain for support, so they use the best rice and wheat to pay public grain and sell surplus grain, selecting large, uniform, and dry grains, carrying them load by load to the grain station. Such grain loads are endless on the roads, one after another. Every load-carrier is covered in sweat and has a flushed face, showing the warmth in the peasants' hearts.

    The masses all expressed satisfaction with the "three fix" policy allocated to households. This is reflected in a poetic statement by the peasants of Jiande, who said: "The unified purchase and sale of grain is the other foot on the socialist road." This means that if peasants want to take the socialist road, one foot is agricultural cooperativization, and the other foot is the unified purchase and sale of grain, and neither is dispensable. The peasant masses have learned from their own experience that only through unified purchase and sale can the people's lives be guaranteed. Like the great flood last year, if there had been no unified purchase and sale and the grain had been manipulated by private merchants, grain prices would have soared long ago, and the disaster victims would have fallen into the tragic situation of fleeing famine. It is precisely because the peasant masses have this understanding that "five mores" and "five lesses" have emerged in Jiande Special District after the "three fix." The "five mores" are: more satisfaction with the unified purchase and sale of grain, more active production, more pig raising, more thrift, and more unity between cadres and the masses. The "five lesses" are: fewer strange remarks, less pretending to be poor, less scolding of cadres, less idle land, and fewer lazy people.

    One Upsurge After Another

    With the development of agricultural cooperativization, the tasks of agricultural production have increased, the volume of agricultural production has increased, and the lives of the peasants have improved. Therefore, the current culture, education, health, postal service, telecommunications, transportation, etc. in the countryside all seem to be out of proportion, and the supply of industrial and commercial products cannot keep up. Moreover, the more than 50 million mu of barren mountains in Zhejiang Province threaten farmland. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee are busy deploying and promoting various tasks: to eliminate barren mountains and green the entire province within 7 years; to establish 50 small hydropower stations with a generating capacity of 1,000 kilowatts within two years; to add 30 meteorological observatories and climate stations within two years; to restore the province's main highway lines and build simple county and district roads totaling 1,000 kilometers by 1957, and to build county, district, and township handcart roads totaling 2,000 kilometers; to have telephones and post offices in every district and township by 1957; to establish 6 fertilizer plants in 1956; to supply 2,000 water pumps, 10,000 farm boats, 80,000 double-wheel double-share plows, and 100,000 rice threshers in 1956; to eliminate illiteracy among village cadres within two or three years and eliminate illiteracy among 6.8 million young and middle-aged people in the province within 7 years; to implement universal compulsory education in rural areas in the short term; to basically eliminate schistosomiasis by 1960 and basically eliminate filariasis by 1962.

    The situation is developing rapidly. Following the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, there will be an upsurge of agricultural production, and even more so an upsurge of cultural construction. These many upsurges, one after another, like the Qiantang River tide on the night of the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, set off thousands upon thousands of waves, all surging up the Qiantang River, how beautiful and magnificent!

    我所见的浙江农村
    全国人民代表大会代表　梁希
    从新登经桐庐、建德、兰溪、金华、衢县到开化，七个县，数百里间江山如旧，而农村生产关系发生了剧烈的变化，成千成万农民的生活水平，文化程度和思想情况也有了显著的改变。落后乡前进了，文盲识字了，余粮户代替了缺粮户，自由恋爱代替了包办婚姻。新中国的农村，真所谓“年年岁岁花相似，岁岁年年人不同”。
    百斤棉、千斤稻、万斤薯
    从1954年到1955年两年间，浙江全省粮食产量由1，419，000多万斤增加到1，527，000多万斤，皮棉产量由458，000多担增加到707，000多担，络麻产量由1，462，000担增加到2，615，000担。慈溪县4个乡已经有29，000多亩棉田成为“百斤棉田”，每亩平均产皮棉100斤以上。余姚、鄞县两县已经有十分之二的连作稻田成为“千斤稻田”，每亩平均产稻谷千斤以上。余姚、慈溪、定海等县已经出现了“万斤薯田”，即每亩平均产甘薯万斤以上。由此可见，浙江的农业生产还有很大的潜力。跟着合作化的发展，不久一定会在更广大的面积上生产出更好更多的农产品。
    毛主席说：“我们的合作化的发展是健康的，是可以基本上保证增产而避免减产的。”下面的事实就是活生生的例子。新登、富阳、昌化、分水、遂安、淳安、桐庐7个县2，060个社统计，有93.8％的社增产。建德县331个社统计，有89％的社增产，5.4％的社保持1954年水平。增产鼓励了初级社转变成高级社。建德县庵口乡千鹤农业生产合作社的社员们看到增产是劳动的结果，就自动地取消了土地报酬，把初级社转成了高级社。
    伟大的农民战胜了天灾
    1955年6月金华、建德两专区的水灾，据说是400年来最大的一次。有几个县城，大水涨到楼上，甚至达到了楼顶。建德专区受灾县八个，重灾县有三个，灾民34万多人，灾田灾地42万多亩。金华专区受灾县八个，重灾县有三个，灾民50多万人，受灾田地97万多亩。水灾之大惊人。
    但是，农民们斗争力量之大也很惊人。在中国共产党领导下，几十万灾民喊出了一个口号：生产自救！一百几十万非灾区农民又掀起了一个运动：爱国增产。伟大的农民战胜了天灾，建德专区1955年比上年增产粮食8.8％，金华专区1955年比上年增产粮食6.7％。
    沿着社会主义道路前进的农民，生产情绪十分高涨。有的用集体力量来兴修水利，如诸暨，8个月间用28万劳动力筑了东白渠，免除了4万多亩耕地的旱涝灾；金华有一个合作社，用20多辆水车把水戽过一个山头来抗旱；在建德专区，100多万人工兴修了17，000多处水利，受益面积554，000多亩。有的用集体力量来治虫，如建德专区，1955年7月和8月间发生了两次虫灾，受灾稻田达54万多亩，重灾26万多亩，但是害虫终被群众彻底消灭。
    农民们不仅学会了改良土壤，还学会了改进生产技术，改变耕作制度。多山的地区，富阳、新登、桐庐三县的耕作制度也已经有很大的改变，单季稻改双季稻34，000多亩，中稻改晚稻67，000多亩，低产作物改高产作物37，000多亩，旱地改水田12，000多亩。
    “走社会主义道路的另一只脚”
    农业丰收的原因，主要的固然是农民群众（特别是合作社）的力量巨大，而政府的及时支援，也发生了重大作用。仅建德一个专区，国家银行贷款219万多元，信用社贷款146万多元，国家供给的生产资料（包括肥料在内）值343万多元。物力、财力和人力结合，创造了1955年的大丰收。农民感谢党，感谢政府。建德县庵口乡千鹤社贫农徐连行说：“毛主席不仅告诉我们走社会主义道路的方向，而且给了我们走社会主义道路的路费。”
    农民群众得到了党和政府的关怀，满足了生产和生活上的需要，人人感到温暖，从温暖中自然而然地发生爱：爱社，爱乡，爱国。他们知道，国家工业化需要粮食来支援，就用最好的稻谷和麦子交公粮、卖余粮，选择大粒的，均匀的，干燥的，一担一担地挑向粮站。这样的粮担，在公路上络绎不绝，一个接着一个。每一个挑担的人都是满头大汗，满脸红润，表示出农民们内心的热。
    群众对“三定”到户的政策都表示满意。这表现在建德农民富有诗意的一句话，农民说：“粮食统购统销，是走社会主义道路的另一只脚。”意思是说，农民要走社会主义道路，一只脚是农业合作化，另一只脚是粮食统购统销，二者缺一不可。农民群众从自己的经验中体会到，只有统购统销，才可以保证人民生活，像去年那样的大水灾，如果没有统购统销，粮食被私商操纵，粮价早就飞涨，灾民早就陷入逃荒的悲惨境地。正由于农民群众有了这样体会，所以建德专区在“三定”后出现了“五多”和“五少”。“五多”是：对粮食统购统销满意的多，积极生产的多，养猪的多，节约的多，干部和群众团结的多。“五少”是：说怪话的少，装穷的少，骂干部的少，空间田少，懒汉少。
    高潮一个接着一个
    随着农业合作化的发展，农业生产任务加重了，农业生产量增加了，农民生活提高了，于是农村中现在的文教、卫生、邮电、交通等都显得不相称，工商业供应品也跟不上去，浙江全省五千多万亩荒山更成为农田的威胁。因此，省委、省人民委员会忙于布置和推动各种工作：要在7年内消灭山荒，绿化全省；要在两年内建立50个小型水力发电站，发电量达到1，000瓩；要在两年内添设30个气象台、气候站；要到1957年恢复全省公路干线和修建县区简易公路共1，000公里，修建县、区、乡手车大道2，000公里；要到1957年每区每乡都有电话和邮站；要在1956年设立6处肥料厂；要在1956年供应2，000台抽水机、1万只农船、8万架双轮双铧犁、10万架打稻机；要在两三年内扫除乡村干部中的文盲，7年内扫除全省680万青壮年文盲；要在短期内在乡村施行普及义务教育；到1960年基本上消灭血吸虫病，到1962年基本上消灭血丝虫病。
    形势发展得很快，跟着农业合作化高潮的到来，就来一个农业生产高潮，更来一个文化建设高潮。这许多高潮，一个接着一个，像夏历8月18日夜半的海宁潮一样，掀起千千万万个浪头，一齐涌上钱塘江，多么美丽、雄壮！
