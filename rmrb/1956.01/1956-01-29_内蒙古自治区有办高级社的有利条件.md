Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has favorable conditions for establishing advanced cooperatives
By our reporter Lin Mo

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has vast land, with an average of about 12 mu of cultivated land per agricultural person in the entire region. In the relatively densely populated Pingdiquan Administrative Region, each person averages eight or nine mu of cultivated land. In the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas and some agricultural areas, there is also a lot of wasteland; farmers in these places can cultivate more land as long as they have labor and livestock power. In some places, after the land reform, the land belongs to the whole banner people, and the farmers only have the right to use it but not the right of ownership. Therefore, in most areas of the autonomous region, farmers have a relatively weak concept of private ownership of land. When establishing agricultural production cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature, many cooperatives had a lower land dividend ratio.

The Inner Mongolia region has many livestock (an average of two or three head of large livestock per household), and livestock prices are relatively low. Many agricultural production cooperatives have already valued their draught animals and brought them into the cooperative for convenient collective use. According to statistics: among the 6,994 old cooperatives established in the entire region before the autumn of 1955, 461 did not distribute profits for land, more than 3,000 had land remuneration of 0.5% to 10% of the normal output, 2,043 had draught animals valued and brought into the cooperative, and 5,381 had farm tools valued and brought into the cooperative. Among the more than 26,000 new cooperatives established in the high tide of cooperativization after the autumn of 1955, there were even more that did not distribute profits for land and had draught animals and farm tools valued and brought into the cooperative. For example, among the more than 300 new cooperatives newly established in the Left Wing Middle Banner of Horqin, one-third demanded the abolition of land remuneration, and about half had draught animals and farm tools valued and brought into the cooperative.

This situation is extremely favorable for establishing advanced cooperatives. Some places have appropriately used these superior conditions, so that the transition of agricultural production cooperatives from the elementary stage to the advanced stage has been relatively rapid and smooth. For example, in the past month or so, Jerim League has built 315 advanced cooperatives, and the number of farmers joining the cooperatives has reached 12.2% of the total number of farmers in the league.

Some local workers have not yet clearly recognized and made good use of these superior conditions, and boldly and freely established advanced cooperatives according to the demands of the masses and the favorable situation of the high tide of cooperativization. They regard advanced cooperatives as mysterious and unpredictable, and make things that are easy to do complicated and difficult. Some cooperatives have long since made the main means of production such as land, draught animals, and farm tools public, but they believe that they are "not qualified" and do not approve them as advanced cooperatives.

It should be believed that advanced cooperatives can increase production more than elementary cooperatives. Since the solution of the problem of public ownership of basic means of production has many favorable conditions in most areas of Inner Mongolia, these areas should be good at bringing into play favorable conditions and actively and systematically advance towards complete socialism on the basis of having realized semi-socialist agricultural cooperation.

Of course, the difficult side cannot be ignored. In many areas of Inner Mongolia, farmers live scattered, transportation is inconvenient, ethnic groups are mixed, and in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, the appropriate handling of animal husbandry is also involved. To establish advanced cooperatives that are both numerous and good, a lot of hard and meticulous work must also be carried out.

What is particularly important is: with the establishment of advanced cooperatives, the socialist consciousness of the members should be further enhanced, the superior conditions of the advanced cooperatives and the labor enthusiasm of the members should be fully brought into play, and production should be greatly increased. At present, the best way to do this is to mobilize all members to formulate a comprehensive plan for advanced cooperatives. The plan should set out long-term visions and practical and reliable specific measures for increasing production in many ways, transforming nature, and developing cultural, health, and welfare undertakings. This can make each member clearly see the happy and fulfilling future after establishing advanced cooperatives. The recent planning results of some advanced cooperatives in Inner Mongolia show that poor peasants have become more active and determined; middle peasants are also happier and more excited; young people have become shock forces in production; women are also glad that they can gradually be liberated from housework; and the elderly think of their happy old age. The bright and beautiful picture of socialism attracts and unites every member of the advanced cooperative, and everyone's production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high.

    内蒙古自治区有办高级社的有利条件
    本报记者　林沫
    内蒙古自治区土地宽广，全区平均每个农业人口约有12亩耕地。在农业人口较稠密的平地泉行政区，每人平均也有八、九亩耕地。在半农、半牧区和部分农业区，还有很多荒地；这些地方的农民，只要有劳力和畜力，就可以多种地。还有些地方，土地改革后，土地归全旗人民公有，农民只有使用权而无所有权。因此，在自治区的大部分地区，农民对土地的私有观念比较薄弱。在建立半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社的时候，有很多社的土地分益比例就较低。
    内蒙古地区牲畜多（平均每个农户有二、三头大牲畜），牲畜价格较低，有不少农业生产合作社为了集体使用耕畜方便，已经把耕畜作价归社。据统计：全区在1955年秋前建立的6，994个老社中，土地不分红的461个，土地报酬为通常产量的0.5％到10％的3，000多个，耕畜作价归社的2，043个，农具作价归社的5，381个。在1955年秋后合作化高潮中建立的26，000多个新社中，土地不分红和耕畜、农具作价归社的就更多了。如科尔沁左翼中旗新建的300多个新社中，要求取消土地报酬的有三分之一，耕畜、农具作价归社的约占一半。
    这种情况，对建立高级社极为有利。有些地方适当地运用了这些优越条件，使农业生产合作社由初级阶段到高级阶段的过渡，进行得比较迅速和顺利。如哲里木盟在最近一个多月中，已经建成高级社315个，入社农户已经达到全盟总农户的12.2％。
    有些地方的工作人员，目前还没有清楚地认识和很好地利用这些优越条件，根据群众要求和合作化高潮的有利形势，大胆放手地去办高级社。他们把高级社看得高深莫测，把本来容易办的事情变得复杂和困难了。有些合作社的土地、耕畜、农具等主要生产资料老早就已经公有化了，他们却认为“不够格”，不批准为高级社。
    应当相信，高级社比初级社能更多地增加生产。既然在内蒙古的大部分地区基本生产资料公有化问题的解决有许多有利条件，这些地区就应该善于发挥有利条件，在已经实现了半社会主义农业合作化的基础上，积极地有计划地向完全社会主义前进。
    当然，也不可忽视困难的一面。内蒙古很多地区农民居住分散，交通不便，民族杂居，在半农、半牧地区还牵涉到牧业的适当处理问题。要把高级社办得既多又好，还应当进行许多艰苦细致的工作。
    特别重要的是：随着高级社的建立，应当进一步提高社员的社会主义觉悟，充分发挥高级社的优越条件和社员的劳动积极性，大大提高生产。在这方面，目前最好的办法，就是发动全体社员制定高级社的全面规划。在规划中定出多方面增加生产、改造自然、发展文化卫生福利事业的远景和切实可靠的具体措施。这就可以使每个社员清楚地看到办高级社以后的美满幸福前途。内蒙古各地最近有些高级社进行规划的结果，贫农表现更加积极、坚决了；中农也更欢乐、兴奋了；青年人成为生产的突击力量；妇女也庆幸自己可以逐渐从家务劳动中得到解放；老年人则想到自己幸福的晚年。社会主义的光明、美好图景吸引和团结着每一个高级社社员，大家的生产情绪空前高涨。
