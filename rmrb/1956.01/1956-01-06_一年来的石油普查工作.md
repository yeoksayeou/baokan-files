Oil Survey Work Over the Past Year
National People's Congress Representative, Standing Committee Member of the Geological Department's Exploration Committee, Huang Jiqing

    In order to accelerate China's socialist industrialization and meet the needs of all aspects of the national economy and national defense, it is necessary to rapidly discover as many oil fields as possible and ascertain sufficient reserves. To this end, the Ministry of Geology vigorously strengthened oil survey work in 1955.

    We are convinced that China has oil. However, China is so large, and the geological conditions are very complex. Where should we focus our meager survey resources to be most effective and most likely to achieve significant results in the short term? We decided that survey areas should be those where geological conditions, especially geotectonics and sedimentary environment, are most conducive to oil generation and accumulation, as close as possible to areas currently undergoing oil exploration, and where general geographical conditions, especially transportation, are relatively favorable. Based on these principles, we selected areas and quickly organized forces to carry out survey work. In the Northwest alone, one large team has five survey teams, one detailed survey team, two barite teams, one oil shale team, one comprehensive research team, and, in geophysical prospecting, one electrical survey team and four gravimetric survey teams. In addition, students and teachers from the Geology Department of Beijing Geological College and the Geology Department of Northwest University were organized to participate in the survey work.

    The fieldwork for the oil survey this year was intense, and the living conditions were harsh. Comrades working in the Qaidam Basin and the Junggar Basin often faced difficulties in obtaining water. When searching for barite and auxiliary materials, they often had to climb mountains of four to five thousand meters. The mosquito swarms of the Ulungur River, the periodic sandstorms of Qaidam, the strong spring winds of Liupan Mountain, the sweltering heat and incessant rain in southern Sichuan, and the horse leeches and jungle thorns in the high mountain areas of western Sichuan all brought certain difficulties to the work. However, the comrades of the survey team tenaciously overcame all kinds of difficulties and completed the tasks assigned by the state. The survey team in a certain area completed route geological maps of the entire area and its surrounding areas for thousands of kilometers, initially grasped the characteristics of the geological structure and sedimentary environment of the area, and discovered many oil-bearing structures, most of which are very favorable for oil storage. After surveying another area of the region, they also delineated some oil-bearing structures as bases for detailed measurement and drilling; they also discovered several bituminous coal fields, which can initially solve the general coal and industrial coal needs of the area. In addition, they collected necessary information on economic geography and transportation. Based on this, a preliminary assessment of the oil-bearing prospects of the area can be made, and specific recommendations for further surveys, detailed surveys, and detailed measurements in the future can be proposed. The survey teams in other regions have also obtained valuable geological data and discovered several potentially oil-bearing structures.

    It is estimated that at least half of the oil-bearing structures discovered in the past year's survey work are available for detailed measurement. After detailed measurement, it can be further determined whether they have drilling value. This will greatly help to change the passive situation in China's oil exploration work where the survey cannot keep up with detailed measurement, and detailed measurement cannot keep up with drilling.

    During the past year's fieldwork, technicians learned advanced Soviet experience and became familiar with oil survey operating procedures. Personnel working in Xinjiang had particularly good conditions; they learned a lot of valuable experience and theoretical knowledge from Xinjiang Petroleum Company, especially from the Soviet experts of the company. Due to this learning and training, the level of technical personnel has greatly improved, and many junior geological personnel already have the ability to lead the work of grass-roots units.

    However, there are also many shortcomings in the work of the past year. The most important are the lack of clarity regarding the purpose and comprehensiveness of oil survey work, insufficient research on issues, the lack of follow-up scientific research, and too little geophysical prospecting work; some teams even had none at all. On-site inspections and assistance for the work of various survey teams were also insufficient. This affected the quality of oil survey work and affected the understanding and determination of the oil-bearing nature of formations.

    At present, China's agricultural collectivization movement is developing rapidly, and the speed of socialist industrialization will also greatly accelerate. Various sectors of the national economy are increasingly urgently and increasingly in need of oil. Therefore, oil survey work must catch up. In order to improve oil survey work, the following three issues should be addressed in future work:

    First, the issue of cadres. At present, there is a shortage of cadres in oil survey work, especially technical cadres in geology, geophysical prospecting, surveying, and drilling. Therefore, we must pay close attention to the work of training cadres and growing technical strength. In this regard, we must pay attention to both the improvement of old technical cadres and the training of new technical cadres. We should admit that old, senior technical personnel, coming from the old society, have been stained with many old things ideologically. In addition to the need to strengthen business learning, especially the learning of advanced experience from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, they also need to earnestly study politics, study Marxism-Leninism, and carry out ideological and academic criticism and self-criticism. At the same time, old, senior technical personnel should improve themselves in the practice of survey and exploration work, especially in fieldwork and comprehensive research, and systematically and step-by-step train new technical cadres.

    Second, the issue of work arrangements. Oil surveys and exploration should adopt the principle of "both broad and in-depth." The more survey areas there are, the wider the area, the greater the chance of discovering oil fields. Therefore, it is necessary to select as many areas as possible throughout the country, even remote areas, for large-scale surveys. This is "broad." The result of the survey can only be speculative and far from the goal of discovering oil fields. To really find oil, drilling is necessary, and often a large amount of footage is needed. Therefore, some of the most promising oil-bearing structures should be selected from the areas that have already been surveyed for detailed surveys and detailed measurements, and the detailed measurements should lead to systematic and thorough drilling. This is "in-depth." The close combination of in-depth and broad is the correct approach to exploring for oil at present.

    Third, the issue of strengthening scientific research. The entire oil exploration work, from survey to proving reserves, is a series of scientific theoretical deduction work. It involves comprehensively analyzing and studying a large amount of survey and detailed measurement data, proposing scientific evidence and arguments to guide the drilling process. Therefore, the problem of finding oil is basically a geological problem, that is, using geological theory to guide drilling practice, and testing and revising geological theory from practice. We should try our best to collect as many objective facts as possible – survey, detailed survey, detailed measurement, geophysical prospecting, geochemical prospecting, etc. – continuously conduct detailed and in-depth comprehensive research, scientifically argue for the oil-bearing nature of a certain area and the oil storage conditions of certain formations, and then arrange the drilling network and invest a large amount of drilling footage. It is naturally good if the drilling results are successful. Once they fail, we must never lose heart; we should summarize the experience and lessons, revise the geological theory, "regroup," select another location, and re-arrange the drilling.

    In 1956, the amount of oil survey work will increase three or four times compared to 1955, the task has become heavier, and the nature of the work has become more complex. We must arrange our future work better and quickly find more economically valuable oil fields.

　　一年来的石油普查工作
　　全国人民代表大会代表  地质部普查委员会常务委员  黄汲清
    为了加速我国的社会主义工业化，满足国民经济各方面和国防上的需要，必须迅速发现尽可能多的油田，探明足够的储量。为此，地质部在1955年大力加强了石油普查工作。
    我们确信中国是有石油的，但是中国这样大，地质条件又非常复杂，我们这微薄的普查力量究竟应该放在哪些地区才是最有利的，才是最可能在短期内获得显著成果的呢？我们决定普查地区应该是地质条件、特别是大地构造和沉积环境对石油的生成和聚集最有利的地区，应该尽可能地靠近目前正在进行石油勘探的地区，应该是一般地理条件、特别是交通条件比较有利的地区。我们根据这些原则选定了地区，迅速组织了力量，先后展开普查工作。其中仅西北的一个大队就拥有五个普查队、一个详查队，两个重晶石队、一个油页岩队、一个综合研究队、还有地球物理探矿方面的一个电测队和四个重磁力普查队。此外，还组织北京地质学院和西北大学地质系的生产实习师生参加了普查工作。
    这一年石油普查的野外工作是紧张的，生活是艰苦的。在柴达木盆地和准噶尔盆地工作的同志经常感到用水的困难，寻找重晶石和辅助原料的时候还要经常爬四五千公尺的高山。乌伦古河的蚊群，柴达木的周期性风砂，六盘山的春季大风，川南的酷暑和霪雨，川西高山区的旱马蝗和丛林荆棘，都给工作带来一定的困难。但是普查队的同志顽强地克服种种困难，完成国家交给的任务。某地的普查大队完成了全区及其边缘地带的路线地质图共数千公里，初步掌握了该地地质构造和沉积环境的特点，发现许多储油构造，其中大部分是对储油非常有利的。他们普查了该地的另一地区之后，还圈定了一些储油构造，作为细测和钻探的基地；还发现几处烟煤田，可以初步解决该地一般用煤和工业用煤的需要。此外还搜集了经济地理和交通运输方面的必需资料，根据这些，可以作出该地含油远景的初步评价，提出今后进一步普查、详查和细测的具体建议。其他各个地区的普查大队也都获得不少可贵的地质资料，发现若干可能储油的构造。
    一年来普查工作所发现的储油构造，估计至少有一半可供细测。经过细测之后，就可以进一步确定有无钻探价值。这对于改变我国石油勘探工作中普查赶不上细测，细测赶不上钻探的被动局面有很大的作用。
    在一年来的野外工作中，技术人员学习了苏联先进经验，熟悉了石油普查操作规程。在新疆工作的人员条件特别好，他们从新疆石油公司，特别从公司的苏联专家，学得许多宝贵的经验和理论知识。由于这些学习和锻炼，技术人员的水平有了很大的提高，不少初级地质人员已具有领导基层单位工作的能力。
    但是，一年来工作中的缺点也是很多的，最主要的是对石油普查工作的目的性和综合性不明确，研究问题不够全面，科学研究工作没有跟上去，地球物理探矿工作太少，有些队甚至根本没有。对各个普查大队工作的实地检查和帮助也很不够。这样就影响了石油普查工作的质量，影响了地层含油性的了解和确定。
    目前我国农业合作化运动正突飞猛进地发展，社会主义工业化的速度也将大大加快。国民经济各个部门越来越迫切地，越来越多地需要石油，因此，石油普查工作必须迎头赶上。为了提高石油普查工作，在今后工作中应该注意解决以下三个问题：
    第一、干部问题。目前石油普查工作的干部缺乏，特别是地质、地球物理探矿、测量、钻探的技术干部更缺乏。因此，必须十分注意培养干部、生长技术力量的工作。在这方面，既要注意老的技术干部的提高，又要注意新的技术干部的培养。我们应该承认，老的、高级的技术人员，由于从旧社会中来，思想上沾染了不少旧的东西。他们除了需要加强业务学习，特别是学习苏联和人民民主国家的先进经验外，还特别需要认真地学习政治，学习马列主义，展开思想上和学术上的批评和自我批评。同时，老的高级的技术人员应该在普查和探勘工作的实践中，特别在野外工作和综合研究中提高自己，并有计划有步骤地培养新的技术干部。
    第二、工作安排问题。进行石油普查和勘探要采取“既宽广又深入”的方针。普查的地区越多，面积越广，发见油田的机会自然越大。因此，在全国范围内尽量多挑一些地区，那怕是偏僻的地区，进行大规模的普查，是很必要的。这就是“宽广”。普查的结果只能是推断性的，离发现油田的目的尚远；真正要找到油，一定需要钻探，而且往往需要大量的进尺。所以应该从已经普查的区域中挑选一些最有希望的储油构造进行详查和细测，由细测而进入系统的彻底的钻探。这就是“深入”。深入和宽广密切结合是目前勘探石油的正确方针。
    第三、是加强科学研究问题。整个石油勘探工作，从普查到探明储量，是一系列的科学理论推断工作，是综合大量普查和细测资料，进行深入的分析研究，提出科学的证据和论断，以指导钻探的过程。因此，找油问题基本上是一个地质问题，也就是拿地质理论指导钻探实践，又从实践中来考验、修正地质理论的问题。我们应该想尽各种方法，搜集尽可能多的客观事实——普查、详查、细测、地球物理探矿、地球化学探矿等等资料，不断地进行细致而深入的综合研究，科学地论断某一地区的含油性和某些地层的储油条件，从而布置钻探网和投入大量的钻探进尺。钻探结果如果成功自然很好，一旦失败也决不可灰心；应该总结经验教训，修正地质理论，“重整旗鼓”，另选地点，重新布置钻探。
    1956年石油普查工作量较1955年增加三、四倍，任务加重了，工作性质更复杂了，我们一定要把今后的工作安排得更好，迅速找到更多的有经济价值的油田。
