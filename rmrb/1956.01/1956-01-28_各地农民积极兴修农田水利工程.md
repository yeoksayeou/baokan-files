    Farmers in Various Regions Actively Build Farmland Water Conservancy Projects

    With the upsurge of the agricultural cooperation movement, a vigorous winter farmland water conservancy construction and winter watering campaign has been universally launched in rural areas across the country. According to incomplete statistics, from October last year to early January this year, a total of more than 600,000 completed and ongoing projects involving canals, ponds, dams, and weirs have been completed or are under construction nationwide. More than 570,000 various types of water wells have been dug, potentially expanding the irrigated area by more than 21 million mu. Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and other regions have already winter-watered more than 40 million mu of wheat and fallow land.

    The scale of winter farmland water conservancy construction and winter watering work in various regions has surpassed previous years. According to statistics from Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Hunan provinces, a total of more than 17 million farmers participated in winter farmland water conservancy construction. This winter, many regions have also constructed some larger-scale farmland water conservancy projects. For example, farmers in the Lishan, Wuji, and Hanlou townships of Huoqiu County, Anhui Province, jointly built a reservoir capable of irrigating more than 17,000 mu of land.

    各地农民积极兴修农田水利工程
    随着农业合作化运动高潮的到来，各地农村普遍开展了热火朝天的冬修农田水利和冬浇活动。据不完全统计，从去年10月到今年1月上旬，全国已经完工的和正在施工的渠、塘、坝、堰等工程共有60多万处，已经打成的各种水井有57万多眼，共可扩大灌溉面积2，100多万亩。河北、河南、山东、陕西、甘肃、内蒙古、新疆等地已经冬浇小麦和冬闲地4，000多万亩。
    各地冬修农田水利和冬浇工作的规模，超过了往年。据河南、安徽、江苏、湖北、湖南5省的统计，参加冬修农田水利的农民共有1，700多万人。这个冬季，不少地区还修建了一些规模较大的农田水利工程。如安徽省霍邱县溜山、吴集、韩楼3个乡的农民，就联合修建了一座能灌田17，000多亩的水库。
