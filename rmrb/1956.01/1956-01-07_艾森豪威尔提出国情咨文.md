Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th -- Washington News: On January 5th, President Eisenhower's annual State of the Union Address was delivered in the United States Congress. The address outlined the Republican government's diplomatic and domestic measures over the past three years and proposed the basic program for future foreign, military, and domestic policies.

Apparently focusing on the election to be held in November this year, Eisenhower in his address tried his best to defend and tout the Republican government's measures over the past three years. He said that the United States is now "at peace." The summit meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France held in Geneva last July "brought hope to the world that the sharpness in the language and actions that could generate conflict and war would tend to soften. It was unanimously agreed that nuclear war would be an intolerable disaster and must never be allowed to happen."

In his address, Eisenhower repeatedly claimed that the purpose of American foreign policy is "just peace," but in reality, he used a great deal of space to promote that the United States would continue to implement the "policy of strength" in preparation for war in the future. In order to justify the continued implementation of this policy, he tried his best to portray the development of the international situation, which showed the failure of the "policy of strength," as an "achievement" of the "policy of strength," and repeated the old tune of the so-called "Communist threat" from the Soviet Union and China.

Eisenhower said that the policy of the United States is to continue to maintain an "effective system of collective security" including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Manila Treaty, and the Baghdad Treaty, to maintain "deterrent military strength," and to rely on the "power of the atom." In this regard, he specifically mentioned the need to strengthen the military strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

When talking about disarmament, he insisted on the aerial inspection proposal that actually rejected disarmament.

He said that the United States should maintain and strengthen its "aid" to other countries and "economic assistance" to backward areas. He asked Congress to "grant limited powers" to "undertake long-term obligations to provide assistance." He explained that the purpose of these "aid" is to enable "the United States and its friends" to "gain greater strength."

He said that the United States should continue to expand its military preparations for war for a long time. The United States should continue to spend a "large portion" of the national budget to "maintain strong military potential" in the "indefinite future." The United States should "manufacture and use new weapons" and "incorporate the latest scientific developments (including new atomic weapons) into our military plans." Eisenhower also asked for a renewed extension of the so-called "Defense Production Act" in preparation for war mobilization.

When talking about the fiscal budget, he admitted that the "current tax rates are very heavy" in the United States, but he said that he would continue to "maintain all current consumption taxes without reduction."

### 艾森豪威尔提出国情咨文

　　艾森豪威尔提出国情咨文
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：1月5日，在美国国会里宣读了总统艾森豪威尔一年一次的国情咨文。咨文概述了共和党政府三年来的外交内政措施，并且提出今后的外交、军事和内政政策的基本纲领。
    显然着眼于将在今年11月举行的选举，艾森豪威尔在咨文中竭力为共和党政府三年来的措施辩护和吹嘘。他说，美国现在是“处在和平中”。去年7月在日内瓦举行的苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑会议“为世界带来了可能产生冲突和战争的言论和行动中的尖刻程度趋于缓和的希望。大家一致同意，核子战争将是一种不能忍受的灾难，决不能够允许它发生”。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文中一再声称美国外交政策的目的是“公正的和平”，但是，他在实际上用很长的篇幅来宣扬美国今后要继续执行准备战争的“实力政策”。为了替继续执行这种政策辩解，他竭力把显示“实力政策”失败的国际局势的发展说成是“实力政策”的“成就”，并且重弹了所谓苏联和中国“共产主义威胁”的老调。
    艾森豪威尔说，美国的政策是要继续保持一个包括北大西洋公约组织、马尼拉条约、巴格达条约等的“集体安全的有效体系”，保持“威慑性军事力量”，仰仗“原子的威力”。在这方面，他特别提到要加强北大西洋公约集团的军事力量。
    在谈到裁军问题时，他坚持实际上拒绝裁军的空中视察建议。
    他说，美国要保持和加强对其他国家的“援助”，对落后地区的“经济援助”。他要求国会“授以有限的权力”来“承担进行援助的长期义务”。他说明这些“援助”的目的在使“美国和它的朋友”“获得更大的实力”。
    他说，美国国内要长期继续进行扩军备战。美国要继续花费国家预算中的“很大一部分”，在“无限期的将来”“保持强大的军事潜力”。美国要“制造和使用新武器”，“把最新的科学发展（包括新的原子武器在内）包括到我们的军事计划中去”。艾森豪威尔还要求再度延长准备战争动员的所谓“防御生产法”。
    在谈到财政预算时，他承认美国“目前的税率是很重的”，但是他说，要继续“保持目前一切的消费税而不加削减”。
