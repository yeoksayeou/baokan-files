    My Opinions on the Issue of Intellectuals
    Chen Yuan, President of Beijing Normal University

    The tremendous achievements our country has made in science and culture since liberation are inseparable from the correct implementation of the Party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals.

    The glorious admission of Liu Xianzhou, Vice President of Tsinghua University, and many other outstanding teachers into the Party is an example of the victory of the Party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals. Vice President Liu and I have been old friends for thirty years. In the old society, we both stayed out of politics and believed that professional work and politics could be separated. Today, he has become a glorious Communist Party member and a soldier of the proletarian vanguard. What an inspiring thing this is!

    In the past, I thought that people who had spent most of their lives in the old society were deeply influenced by old ideas and had little hope of joining the Party. Seeing the news of Comrade Liu Xianzhou's admission to the Party, I was very excited. That afternoon, I hurriedly wrote a letter to an old student of mine in a distant place, telling him this important news and telling him that this is the direction of our joint efforts as intellectuals. The Communist Party does not reject anyone. As long as you are determined to devote everything to the great revolutionary cause, whether you are old or young, you have the possibility of joining the Party organization. Every revolutionary intellectual should strive to demand themselves according to the standards of a Communist Party member, actively strive to be a glorious Communist Party member, and be determined to fight to the end for the cause of communism.

    That is one aspect.

    On the other hand, the Party must also strengthen its leadership over intellectuals, first of all in political and ideological terms. On some specific issues, I hope that the understanding of intellectuals must be comprehensive and not just one-sided. If you only see the shortcomings and do not trust or respect them, that is certainly wrong; but if you only see the progressive side and affirm that everything is progressive, repeatedly praise them, but the masses have different views on these repeatedly praised people, it will affect the enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, leaders must have a clear understanding of the situation and be able to distinguish right from wrong. This is a very important point.

    The leadership must not forget anyone, and must enable everyone to stride forward together with their heads held high. There must be the feeling that "if one person is in distress, then the whole gathering will be unhappy," and no patriotic and progressive intellectual should be made to feel left out.

    Regarding non-Party senior intellectuals, especially those who are responsible for administrative leadership at all levels, they should be given specific leadership and strong assistance. It is necessary to arm their minds in a timely manner so that they can easily implement the Party's policies on certain major issues. Neglecting this will not only make their own thinking lag behind reality, but also cause unnecessary losses to the Party's cause in action. I saw an old friend who was responsible for administrative leadership. He deeply felt the Party's generous treatment of his material life, taking care of him in every possible way, but he urgently hoped to receive the Party's specific and regular instructions and leadership. Unfortunately, this hope of his has never been valued. For a long time, even the government's instructions on relevant policies have been unknown. He has already felt that he is far behind others. Sometimes when others talk to him about how the superior's instructions are, he is at a loss for words. He often says that he has recently felt at a loss and is about to return to the old intellectual's "two ears do not hear things outside the window," and is re-embarking on the road of detachment from reality. From this point of view, taking care of intellectuals in life is certainly important; but more important is more concern in politics and ideology.

    Senior intellectuals inside and outside the Party must take the initiative to cooperate closely with each other. It is necessary to establish sincere emotional connections in practical work, academic thought, and scientific research, and gradually become close friends. According to the current situation, the vast majority of intellectuals want to make progress and strive for the leadership of the Party. Many people want to pour out their true thoughts and feelings, want to have nothing to hide from the Party, and strive to get more specific guidance, but because everyone is very busy, there are few opportunities to contact. As time goes on, people will feel that the Party is not concerned enough about them and cannot provide specific help. Among our colleagues, there is a Communist Party member who we have been with for only two or three years, but the relationship is extremely harmonious. He is amiable, approachable, humble, and sincere. I regard him as a teacher, and we often exchange opinions with each other, which has been of great help to me. He was later transferred to another place, and I was really reluctant to part with him. When he left, he said: "Don't be strangers to the Party, you can talk about any opinions you have." I often remember his words. But I also often feel that some people are not strangers to the Party, but they just don't have the opportunity to contact the Party, so naturally there is no way to talk about it. Of course, it should also be pointed out that there are indeed many non-Party people who are not active enough and are just waiting for the organization to take care of him, which is not the attitude that one should have towards the Party. In short, both sides should increase their initiative to change the previous situation and achieve closer unity.

    Regarding the issue of cultivating new forces, the Party and the government have always paid great attention to it. However, there is still no relatively clear system and no specific plan for the issue of elderly experts taking apprentices. As far as I know, most experts are sincerely willing to pass on the knowledge they have researched throughout their lives to young people. If the experts' specialties are taught to young people, the young people will not have to start from scratch. If we do not pay attention to this issue at present, I am afraid that in a few years we will feel that we should not have lost the opportunity that we can still seize now. Some experts take on too much administrative work and too many meetings; some have not designated training objects because the leadership has not properly arranged it; and some are unable to concentrate on learning because the training objects also work on other tasks. All these situations prevent experts from fully playing their role. These situations must be changed to better cultivate young scientific talents.

    The above are just some opinions that I have put forward in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything.

    In the past few years, I personally have received great respect and care from the Party, and I have often received concern and inquiries from the Party Central Committee and leading comrades at all levels, which is something I am grateful for and ashamed of. In the future, I am willing to work hard to transform my thinking, strengthen scientific research, further accept Marxist-Leninist theory, rely on the leadership of the Party, and contribute my remaining years more effectively to the cause of the Party, train myself in my work, and strive to be able to join the battle ranks of the working class vanguard.

### 我对知识分子问题的意见

    我对知识分子问题的意见
    北京师范大学校长　陈垣
    解放以来，我国科学、文化事业获得的巨大成绩，是和党的团结改造知识分子的政策的正确执行分不开的。
    清华大学副校长刘仙洲以及各学校不少优秀教师，被光荣地批准入党，就是党的团结改造知识分子政策胜利的一个例证。刘副校长和我是三十年的老朋友，我们在旧社会都是不问政治，都认为业务和政治可以分开的。今天他已经成为光荣的共产党员，已经成为无产阶级先锋队的战士，这是多么振奋人心的事情！
    过去，我以为在旧社会里过了大半生的人，旧思想影响很深，入党的希望不大。看到刘仙洲同志入党的消息，我感到非常兴奋，当天下午急忙写信给我一个远地的老学生、告诉他这个重大消息，并且告诉他这是我们知识分子共同努力的方向。共产党是不拒绝任何人的，只要你决心把自己的一切完全交给伟大的革命事业，不论是年老年轻，都有可能加入党的组织。每一个革命的知识分子都应当以共产党员的标准来努力要求自己，积极争取做一个光荣的共产党员，决心为共产主义事业奋斗到底。
    这是一方面。
    另一方面，党也要加强对于知识分子的领导，首先是政治上、思想上的领导。在一些具体问题上，我希望对于知识分子的了解，一定要全面，不能只了解他们的一面。如果只看到他们缺点的一面，就不信任、不尊重，那固然不对；但如果只看到进步的一面，就肯定他所有的一切都进步，一再表扬，而群众对这一再表扬的人却另有看法，则会影响群众的积极性。因此领导人必须心中有数，是非分明。这是很重要的一点。
    领导上也不能遗忘任何一个人，要使每一个人都能挺胸阔步一齐向前，要有“一人向隅，则举座为之不欢”的感情，不能使任何一个爱国的要求进步的知识分子向隅。
    关于无党派的高级知识分子，特别是他们中间的负责各级行政领导的干部，更要加以具体领导和大力帮助。必须及时武装他们的思想，使他们便于贯彻执行党在某些重大问题上的方针政策。忽略了这些，则不但他们自己的思想会落后于现实，而且行动上会给党的事业造成不必要的损失。我看到一位担负行政领导责任的老朋友，他深深感到党对他的物质生活待遇的优厚，照顾得无微不至，而他迫切地希望能够得到党对他的具体的经常的指示和领导。可惜他的这种希望却始终未被重视。很久以来，连政府的有关方针政策的指示，一直都是茫然不知。他已经感到自己远远落在别人的后面。有时别人和他谈到上级指示如何如何，他则瞠目无以为对。他常常表示说，最近已感到无所措手足了，真是要重新走回我们旧知识分子以前的“两耳不闻天下事”的境地，重新走上脱离实际的路上去了。从这里看，对知识分子在生活上的照顾固然是重要的；但是更重要的还是政治上、思想上更多的关心。
    党内外的高级知识分子必须彼此主动地密切合作。要在实际工作、学术思想、科学研究上建立起真诚的感情上的联系，逐渐成为知心朋友。按目前情况来看，知识分子绝大多数都是要求进步，争取党的领导的。许多人都要求倾吐自己的真实思想感情，想要和党无话不说，争取得到更具体的指教，只因为大家都很忙，就很少接触的机会。这样时间一久，就会令人感到党对他们不够关切，不能给予具体帮助。在我们同事中有一党员同志，我们相处不过二、三年，但是感情极为融洽。他和蔼可亲，虚心诚恳，我拿他当做老师看待，经常彼此交换意见，对我的帮助极大。他后来调到外地，我实在依依不舍。临走的时候，他说：“和党不要见外，有什么意见都可以谈。”我时常记起他这句话。但是也时常感到有些人并不是和党见外，只是和党没有机会接触，自然也就无从谈起了。当然也应该指出，党外人士也确有很多人主动性非常不够，只是等待着组织上去照顾他，这也不是对党应有的态度。总之，两方面都应当增加主动性，以改变以往的情况，做到更紧密的团结。
    关于培养新生力量的问题，党和政府一向是非常注意的。不过在老年专家带徒弟的问题上，却还是没有比较明确的制度，没有具体计划。据我了解，专家们大都是诚恳地愿意把自己钻研了毕生的知识传给青年们的。专家的特长如果教给青年们，青年们就不必再去从头摸索了。如果目前还不注意这一问题，恐怕若干年后就将会感到不应当失掉现在还来得及抓住的机会。有的专家担负行政工作太多，会议太多；有的因为领导方面尚未妥善安排，没有指定培养对象；有的则因培养对象兼作其他工作，不能专心学习。这种种情况，都使专家不能充分发挥他们的作用。必须改变这些情况，更好地培养年轻的科学人材。
    以上仅是我本着知无不言的精神提出的一点意见。
    几年以来，我个人得到党所给予的很大的尊重和照顾，并且经常受到党中央以及各级负责同志的关心和垂问，这对我说来，是感激，也是惭愧。今后我愿意努力改造思想，加强科学研究，进一步接受马克思列宁主义理论，依靠党的领导，把有生之年，更有效地贡献给党的事业，在工作中锻炼自己，争取能够参加工人阶级先锋队的战斗行列。
