    Timely Delivery of Collaborative Products Needed
    By our reporter Chen Ji

    The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, now under construction, is like a surging wave, driving the development and technological advancement of many other industries.

    An ordinary automobile consists of more than three thousand parts and components. Among these parts and components, 405 items are collaborative products, such as electrical appliances, bearings, rubber, glass, asbestos, oilcloth, paper, cork, cotton fabrics, and accompanying tools, which require other factories to trial-produce and manufacture. Currently, from the Songhua River to the Huangpu River, 40 factories across the country are working hard to trial-produce these collaborative products for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. Whether these factories can successfully trial-produce these collaborative products early on is crucial to whether the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant can produce automobiles ahead of schedule this year and whether the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant can carry out normal production in the future. Now, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has proposed to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. If other factories cannot timely supply collaborative products that meet the technical requirements, the plan to produce automobiles ahead of schedule will fall through.

    These collaborative products are mostly new products, with strict technical requirements, making it difficult to trial-produce them successfully all at once. This requires factories to not be afraid of difficulties and to strive to break through technical barriers. Many factories have done this and have already successfully trial-produced a batch of collaborative products.

    The Shenyang Battery Factory has poor technical conditions and outdated equipment. The entire factory has only one chief engineer and a few technicians to take on the technical guidance for trial-producing collaborative products. However, the leaders of this factory are not afraid of difficulties and are determined to trial-produce collaborative products early on. As early as two years ago, they conducted a comprehensive analysis of all the factory's original products to find out the reasons for their good and bad quality, as a reference for trial-producing collaborative products. During the trial-production process, they also took a series of measures to repeatedly improve product quality. Now, the trial-produced collaborative products have basically met the technical requirements.

    There are many similar examples. For example, to trial-produce the thermostat needed for automobiles, a special equipment that China did not have was required. However, the staff and technicians of the Beijing No. 1 Automobile Accessories Factory worked hard to overcome this difficulty, and now they are already trial-producing samples of thermostats, and they will strive to make them as soon as possible. In the past, China had never manufactured automobile steering wheels. There are great technical difficulties in trial-producing this kind of steering wheel. However, the staff and technicians of the Dalian Industrial Bureau Technical Research Office repeatedly trial-produced it many times and have already made a sample. They said: We must trial-produce it successfully to ensure that the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant produces cars ahead of schedule!

    Thanks to the efforts of these factories, 199 of the 405 collaborative products needed by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant have already been successfully trial-produced. This is a great support and encouragement for the staff, workers and engineering technicians of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant to produce automobiles ahead of schedule.

    However, most of the collaborative products have not yet been successfully trial-produced. 45 collaborative products are still at the planning stage and have not been started for trial production. This threatens the realization of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's plan to produce automobiles ahead of schedule. The relevant factories need to catch up quickly and produce qualified collaborative products as soon as possible!

    Can they catch up?

    One of the most urgent issues to be resolved is that the leadership of each factory must attach importance to collaborative products and place the trial-production work of collaborative products in an important position. The current situation is that some factories with better technical conditions have been slow to trial-produce collaborative products.

    The Harbin Ball Bearing Factory originally had better technical conditions to trial-produce collaborative products; however, this factory is delaying. When jointly assessing the samples, this factory only sent one technician to participate, and later did not even send a single technician, so that the samples assessed could not be concluded. This factory has a bearing life testing machine, but they firmly refused to test collaborative products for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, saying that they would not test until 1957. Of the 24 ball bearings they trial-produced, only three simple ball bearings met the technical requirements.

    The technical conditions of the Shanghai Wire Factory are even better. However, dragging on until now, only two of the five types of wires they trial-produced for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant are qualified.

    The collaborative products trial-produced by the Shanghai Heavy Industry Bureau for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant—distributors, induction coils, etc.—are all very important new products. However, the Shanghai Heavy Industry Bureau lacks a long-term plan for trial-producing these new products, and does not follow the regular trial-production procedures, but deals with them in a haphazard manner. Someone suggested that the Shanghai Heavy Industry Bureau improve this backward situation. A section chief of the bureau said: "We can't make a beautiful coat for a beautiful little button!" He didn't know that a good coat can still be worn if it has a bad button; but if a new car is fitted with a bad part, it will not be able to run.

    The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant will soon be officially in production. At that time, it will be necessary to ensure the supply of collaborative products at all times. Even if all the collaborative products can now be successfully trial-produced, production will be difficult if they cannot be supplied in large quantities in the future. It has now been found that there is a danger that collaborative products such as storage batteries and spring washers cannot be supplied in large quantities. This requires the competent departments of these factories to prepare early, plan comprehensively, and catch up in time.

    The automobiles we manufacture ourselves should be very cheap. However, to manufacture low-cost automobiles, in addition to the joint efforts of all staff, workers and engineering technicians of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, it is also necessary for all factories producing collaborative products to pay attention to economic accounting and reduce the cost of collaborative products. The cost of some collaborative products is obviously too high now. A factory trial-produced a rearview mirror lens, which cost 11 yuan; but buying a mirror from the market only costs 8 jiao. This cannot but attract the attention of these factories as soon as possible.

    In 1956, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant will produce automobiles ahead of schedule. The days when collaborative products are needed are approaching day by day. It is hoped that factories with collaborative tasks will work hard to ensure the realization of the national plan to produce automobiles ahead of schedule.

    要及时拿出协作产品来
    本报记者  陈迹
    建设着的第一汽车制造厂，好像一股汹涌澎湃的巨浪，推动着其他许多工业的发展和技术的提高。
    一辆普通汽车是由三千多种零件和合件组成的。在这些零件和合件中，有405项协作产品，如电器、轴承、橡胶、玻璃、石棉、漆布、纸、软木、棉织物和随车工具等，要靠其他工厂来试制和生产。现在，从松花江到黄浦江，全国有40个工厂在紧张地为第一汽车制造厂试制这些协作产品。这些工厂能不能早日试制好协作产品，关系第一汽车制造厂今年能不能提前出产汽车，并且关系第一汽车制造厂将来能不能正常进行生产。现在，第一汽车制造厂已经提出要提早完成五年计划，要是其他工厂不能及时供应合乎技术要求的协作产品，提前出产汽车的计划就会落空。
    这些协作产品大都是新产品，技术要求严格，很难一下子试制成功。这就需要各工厂不怕困难，努力攻破技术堡垒。有许多工厂这样做了，已经试制成功了一批协作产品。
    沈阳电池厂技术条件不好、设备陈旧，全厂只有一个主任工程师和几个技术员，担负试制协作产品的技术指导工作。但是，这个工厂的领导人员不怕困难，坚决要提早试制好协作产品。早在两年以前，他们就把全厂原有的产品做了一次全面的分析，找出质量好坏的原因，以作为试制协作产品的借鉴。在试制过程中，他们又采取一系列措施，反复改进产品质量。现在，试制的协作产品，已经基本上合乎技术要求了。
    这类事例还有很多。例如，试制汽车上需要的恒温器，要有一种特制的我国没有的设备。但是，北京第一汽车附件厂的职工和技术人员努力克服这个困难，现在已经在试制恒温器的样品，并且要争取早日做出来。我国过去没有制造过汽车的转向盘。试制这种转向盘，有很大的技术上的困难。但是，大连工业局技术研究室的职工和技术人员反复试制了许多次，已经做出一个样品来。他们说：一定要试制好，保证第一汽车制造厂提前出车！
    由于这些工厂的努力，第一汽车制造厂需要的405项协作产品，已经有199项试制成功了。这对于第一汽车制造厂职工和工程技术人员提前出产汽车，是极大的支持和鼓舞。
    但是，还有大部分协作产品，没有试制成功。有45项协作产品还停留在计划上，没有着手试制。这威胁着第一汽车制造厂提前出产汽车的计划的实现。各有关工厂需要快快赶上去，及早拿出合格的协作产品来！
    能不能赶上呢？
    一个最迫切需要解决的问题是各工厂的领导方面要重视协作产品，把协作产品的试制工作放在重要地位上。目前的情况是一些技术条件较好的工厂迟迟不能试制好协作产品。
    哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂本来有较好的技术条件试制协作产品；但是，这个工厂在拖延时间。在共同鉴定样品的时候，这个工厂只派一个技术员参加，后来连一个技术员都不派，以致所鉴定的样品都没有能做出结论。这个工厂有一台轴承寿命试验机，但是他们坚决不肯为第一汽车制造厂试验协作产品，说要等到1957年才试验。他们试制的24项滚珠轴承，只有三项简单的滚珠合乎技术要求。
    上海电线厂的技术条件更好。但是拖到现在，他们为第一汽车制造厂试制的五种电线，只有两项合格。
    上海重工业局为第一汽车制造厂试制的协作产品——分电器、感应线圈等，都是很重要的新产品。但是，上海重工业局对于试制这些新产品，缺乏长远计划，不按正规的试制程序办事，而是凑凑合合地来对付。有人建议上海重工业局改进这种落后的状况，这个局一位处长说：“不能为一个漂亮的小钮扣，来做件漂亮的大衣呀！”他不知道，一件好大衣安上个坏钮扣，还可以凑合着穿；要是一辆新汽车安了个坏零件，就会跑不动了。
    第一汽车制造厂不久就要正式生产。那时候，每时每刻都需要保证协作产品的供应。现在即使能够把所有的协作产品都试制成功，如果将来不能大量供应，也会使生产发生困难。现在已经发现：蓄电池、弹簧垫圈等协作产品，就有不能大量供应的危险。这就需要这些工厂的主管部门提早准备，全面规划，及时赶上来。
    我们自己制造的汽车，应该是很便宜的。但是，要制造出成本低廉的汽车，除了第一汽车制造厂全体职工和工程技术人员共同努力外，还需要各个生产协作产品的工厂注意经济核算，降低协作产品的成本。现在有些协作产品的成本显然是高了。有个工厂试制一个后视镜片，需要11元；而从市场上买一个镜子，只要八角。这不能不引起这些工厂及早注意。
    1956年第一汽车制造厂要提前出产汽车。需要协作产品的日子一天天逼近了。希望有协作任务的工厂努力保证实现国家提前出产汽车的计划。
