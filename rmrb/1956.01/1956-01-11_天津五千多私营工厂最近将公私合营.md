Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th - The more than 5,000 factories in 37 industrial sectors in Tianjin, originally scheduled to undergo full industry-wide joint state-private ownership in the first half of this year, will soon be converted into joint state-private enterprises.

As of the 10th, in addition to the eight industrial sectors in Tianjin that are preparing for full industry-wide joint state-private ownership, capitalists in more than 20 industrial sectors, including printing and dyeing, printing, and oleochemicals, have already submitted applications for joint state-private ownership. They guarantee that during the preparation for joint state-private ownership, they will abide by overall planning, submit to the supervision of the working class, not withdraw capital, not conceal property, and not arrange positions for private individuals. Private industrial workers are welcoming joint state-private ownership with high enthusiasm and various practical actions. Approximately 100,000 workers in the city have received education on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

While capitalists are actively applying for full industry-wide joint state-private ownership, rural areas, industrial sectors, and capital construction departments across the country have submitted large numbers of orders to Tianjin. According to statistics, orders for more than 50 products, including diesel engines, water pumps, telecommunications equipment, knitwear, and bone fertilizer, have exceeded the actual production of 1955. Based on the requirements of the orders, the city's electromechanical industry alone needs to add more than 20 new products, such as double-wheeled double-shared plows, locomobile boilers, drilling rigs, bicycles, and power equipment for small power stations. Many existing private factories can only meet this demand after full industry-wide joint state-private ownership and production reorganization. Therefore, relevant departments of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee have decided to approve the industrial sectors that have already applied for joint state-private ownership to implement joint state-private ownership earlier in the near future.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th - The rubber, flour, cigarette, vehicle, and vegetable oil industries in Tianjin officially implemented joint state-private ownership today. Four specialized companies and a tobacco general factory, leading the production and transformation of these five industries, were also established today. Among the managers and deputy managers of these specialized companies, or the director and deputy director of the general factory, nine are incumbent personnel from the capitalist side of these industries.

    天津五千多私营工厂最近将公私合营
    新华社天津10日电　天津市原来预定在今年上半年内实行全行业公私合营的37个工业行业的五千多个工厂，将在最近期间实行公私合营。
    到10日为止，天津市除有八个工业行业正在筹备全行业公私合营以外，全市还有印染、印刷、油脂化学等20多个工业行业的资本家已经提出公私合营的申请。他们保证在筹备公私合营的时候，服从全面规划，服从工人阶级监督，不抽逃资金，不隐匿财产，不安插私人。私营工业职工更以高涨的热情和各种实际行动迎接公私合营，全市约有十万名职工受到对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的教育。
    在资本家积极申请全行业公私合营的同时，全国各地农村、工业和基本建设部门向天津市提出了大批的订货任务。据统计，柴油机、水泵、电讯器材、针棉织品、骨肥等50多种产品今年的订货都超过了1955年的实际产量。根据订货的要求，仅全市的机电工业，就要增加双轮双铧犁、锅驼机、钻探机、自行车和小型发电站的动力设备等20多种新产品。现有的许多私营工厂只有经过全行业公私合营和生产改组以后，才能适应这一要求。因此，天津市人民委员会有关部门决定在最近期间批准已经申请公私合营的工业行业提早实行公私合营。
    据新华社天津10日电　天津市橡胶、面粉、卷烟、车具和植物油五个行业今天正式实行公私合营。领导这五个行业进行生产和改造的四个专业公司和一个烟草总厂也在今天成立。这些专业公司的经理、副经理或总厂厂长、副厂长中有九人是由这些行业的资方实职人员担任的。
