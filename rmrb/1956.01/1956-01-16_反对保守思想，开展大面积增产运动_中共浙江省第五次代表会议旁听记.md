Oppose Conservative Thought, Launch a Large-Scale Production Increase Campaign
-- Notes from the Fifth Zhejiang Provincial Party Congress --
By our reporter Liu Fan
The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a provincial representative meeting from December 11th to 20th, 1955. At this meeting, the main focus was on discussing how to strive to complete the province's increased production plan for major agricultural products such as grain and cotton ahead of schedule by 1957.

Currently, Zhejiang Province has more than 102,000 agricultural production cooperatives, with the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives reaching over 58% of the total number of peasant households. This is the foundation for carrying out a large-scale production increase campaign. Zhejiang Province is one of the high grain-producing areas in the country, and has many industrial raw materials and special crops. For example, silk, tea, cotton, hemp, citrus, and aquatic products occupy an important position in supplying national industrial raw materials and export goods. Therefore, it is completely necessary and feasible to further tap potential and launch a large-scale production increase campaign.

The meeting first exposed and criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking currently present in the large-scale agricultural production increase campaign. In 1949, Zhejiang Province's total grain output for the year was only 8.6 billion jin, but after liberation, production increased year after year. In 1955, the total grain output had reached more than 15.27 billion jin. As a result, some comrades became complacent. They said: "The potential has already been exhausted, and production increases have reached their limit." "This year's harvest is the best it can be, three-crop production is at its highest, and the use of land with a large population and little land has reached its peak." "It's difficult to increase production in mountainous areas, and difficult to increase production in plains." The promotion of new-style agricultural implements is an important condition for increasing production, but they emphasized that the double-wheeled double-shared plow was not easy to use, saying that "Yellow cattle are weak, water buffalo are disobedient, one cow can't pull it, and two cows will fight," "The fields are too narrow to use it, the roads are too narrow to carry it, the weight is too heavy, and the price is too high." They also did not earnestly promote advanced agricultural technologies. For example, the Zhejiang Agricultural College researched the method of grafting sunflowers and sweet potatoes to cultivate sweet potatoes very early on, but it was not promoted in Zhejiang Province. Guangdong Province promoted it instead. Zhejiang Province's experience in winter pest control was promoted in Hunan Province, but not in Zhejiang Province itself. All of these are manifestations of conservative thinking, and have brought serious harm to the agricultural production increase movement. Due to its failure to actively tap potential and change cropping systems by converting low-yield crops into high-yield crops, Jiaxing Prefecture's grain production in the first three years of the first Five-Year Plan was very low. The Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area is famous in Zhejiang for its high yields, but in 1955 the average rice yield was only 481 jin per mu, which was lower than the yields of other regions.

Many representatives used concrete facts to refute the above-mentioned conservative ideas. They listed the fact that in 1955, the province saw several thousand mu of "thousand-jin grain fields," "ten-thousand-jin sweet potato lands," and "hundred-jin cotton (seed cotton) lands," proving that it was entirely possible for the province to strive for large-scale production increases. As long as conservative thinking is overcome and cultivation techniques are improved, production can be greatly increased. In the past few years, the yield of Mahu Township in Yin County was around 500 jin. Some farmers were very dissatisfied and said: "Our yield is 'old five hundred', 'not growing'." After vigorously carrying out the production increase campaign, 17,000 mu of thousand-jin fields appeared in the county in 1955. According to statistics from 5 districts, continuous cropping rice in 62 cooperatives reached a thousand jin per mu. In 4 townships of Cixi County - Shengbei, Xinpu, Shuiyin, and Fuhai - 29,447 mu of cotton fields produced an average of 100 jin of seed cotton per mu. The Wudongzha Advanced Cooperative in Guancheng District produced an average of 119 jin (seed cotton) per mu on 1,380 mu of cotton fields in the entire cooperative, exceeding the provincial average yield by half. Similarly, in Yuyao, Cixi, Dinghai, Wencheng and other counties, there were also facts of "ten thousand jin sweet potatoes" per mu.

The meeting pointed out that all Party members must quickly overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, summarize and promote the experience of large-scale production increases. In this way, it is possible to complete and overfulfill the grain production increase plan for the last two years of the first Five-Year Plan.

The meeting believes that the large-scale production increase campaign is also a basic condition for further consolidating and developing agricultural production cooperatives. If more than 102,000 cooperatives in the province can increase production this year, not only can the existing cooperatives be consolidated, but a large number of new cooperatives can be smoothly developed again this autumn, so that the province can be basically collectivized.

Currently, many counties, after overcoming conservative thinking, are summarizing the masses' experience in increasing production and mobilizing the masses to learn from these experiences. Jinhua County organized more than 20,000 peasant activists to go to various districts in the county and to Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, Zhuji and other counties to learn about increasing production experiences such as planting hemp, planting continuous cropping rice, and cultivating tea trees. The Jiande Prefectural Committee organized more than 100 mutual aid and cooperation ministers and forestry cooperative directors from various counties to Xindeng County to learn about experiences in cultivating oil-tea camellias and winter afforestation. At the same time, labor competitions between townships and townships, cooperatives and cooperatives have also been launched in many counties. Party organizations at all levels should provide strong leadership for this competition.

The meeting pointed out that in order to ensure large-scale agricultural production increases, it is necessary to change cropping systems, plant high-yield crops, and promote high-yield experience. In terms of rice, in addition to continuing to universally promote the seven major technologies of deep plowing and close planting, selecting fine seeds, cultivating strong seedlings, rational close planting, rational fertilization, shallow and frequent irrigation, and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, it is also necessary to actively promote double-season rice and continuous cropping rice. At the same time, it is necessary to expand land utilization and promote high-yield crops. According to surveys, there are still 1 million mu of autumn fallow land and 1.5 million mu of low-yield coarse grain fields in the province. In addition, the mountainous areas, which account for 71% of the province's land, still have a large area that can be used to expand planting of mountain corn, mountain sweet potatoes, and potatoes. If all these lands are used to expand planting and convert to high-yield crops, a large amount of grain can be increased for the country. At the same time, it is also necessary to actively promote fine varieties, open up sources of fertilizer in many ways, build farmland water conservancy projects, and promote new-style agricultural implements. To do these tasks well, the Party organization must fight against conservative thinking in agricultural technology reform.

The meeting believes that the key to overcoming conservative thinking lies in the Party committees at all levels, especially the Party committee secretaries, going deep into the lower levels, going deep into reality, studying problems, solving problems, and summarizing the production increase experience of "thousand-jin grain, ten-thousand-jin sweet potatoes, and hundred-jin cotton" for promotion. Only in this way can we maintain a clear head in the production increase movement and lead the movement to a climax.

    反对保守思想，开展大面积增产运动
    ——中共浙江省第五次代表会议旁听记——
    本报记者　刘凡
    中共浙江省委在1955年12月11日到20日召开了全省代表会议。在这个会议上，着重讨论了如何争取提前完成1957年度全省粮食、棉花等主要农产品的增产计划的问题。
    现在浙江省有102，000多个农业生产合作社，入社农户已达总农户的58％以上，这是开展大面积增产运动的基础。浙江省是全国粮食高产量地区之一，工业原料和特产作物很多，如蚕丝、茶叶、棉麻、柑桔和水产等在供应国家工业原料和出口物资中占有重要地位。因此，进一步挖掘潜力，开展一个大面积的增产运动是完全必要和可以做到的。
    会议首先揭发和批判了当前在开展农业大面积增产运动中的右倾保守思想。1949年浙江省全年粮食总产量只有86亿斤，解放后年年增产，1955年粮食总产量已达到152.7亿多斤。因此有些同志就有了自满情绪，他们说：“潜力已经挖光，增产已经到顶。”“今年年景好到顶，三熟生产高到顶，人多田少利用土地已到顶。”“山区难增产、平原增产难”。推广新式农具是增产的重要条件，但他们强调双轮双铧犁不好使，说“黄牛力气小，水牛不听话，一条牛拉不动，两条牛要打架”、“田狭不好使，路窄不好拿，斤量太重、价钱又大”。对先进的农业技术也不认真推广，如浙江农学院很早就研究出用日光花和甘薯嫁接的方法来培植甘薯，但浙江地区没有推广，广东省倒推广了；浙江省创造的冬季除虫经验，湖南省推广了，但浙江省却没有推广。所有这些都是保守思想的表现，都给农业增产运动带来了严重的危害。嘉兴专区由于没有积极地挖掘潜力，改变耕作制度，把低产作物改为高产作物，因此，第一个五年计划头三年内的粮食产量很低。杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）地区在浙江是以高产量闻名的，但是1955年水稻平均每亩只有481斤，却低于其他地区的产量。
    许多代表用具体的事实批驳了上述的保守思想。他们列举出1955年全省出现了几千亩的“千斤粮田”、“万斤薯地”、“百斤棉（皮棉）地”，证明全省争取大面积增产是完全可能的。只要克服保守思想，改进耕作技术，就可以大量增产。鄞县马湖乡过去几年的产量都在500斤上下，有的农民就很不满意地说：“我们的产量是‘老五百’、‘不长劲’”。以后大力开展了增产运动，1955年全县就出现了17，000亩千斤田。据5个区统计，62个合作社的连作稻达到亩亩千斤。慈谿县胜北、新浦、水霪、附海等4个乡29，447亩棉田，平均每亩产皮棉100斤。观城区五洞闸高级合作社全社1，380亩棉田，平均每亩产119斤（皮棉），超过全省平均产量一半。同样在余姚、慈谿、定海、文成等县也出现了每亩“万斤薯”的事实。
    会议指出，全体党员必须迅速克服右倾保守思想，总结和推广大面积增产经验。这样，有可能完成和超额完成第一个五年计划后两年的粮食增产计划。
    会议认为，大面积增产运动也是促使农业生产合作社进一步巩固和发展的基本条件。全省102，000多个社如果今年都能增产，不但现有的社可以巩固下来，并且今年秋天就能顺利地再发展一大批新合作社，使全省基本上合作化。
    目前已有不少县在克服保守思想后，正总结群众的增产经验和发动群众学习这些增产经验。金华县组织两万多农民积极分子到本县各区和杭县、萧山、诸暨等县去学习种麻、种连作稻、培植茶树等增产经验。建德地委组织各县互助合作部长和林业合作社长100多人到新登县去学习培植油茶、冬季造林等经验。同时在不少县里也开展了乡和乡、社和社的劳动竞赛。各级党组织应对这种竞赛进行有力的领导。
    会议指出，为了保证大面积农业增产，必须改变耕作制度，种植高产作物，推广丰产经验。在水稻方面，除了继续普遍推行深耕密耕、选用良种、培育壮苗、合理密植、合理施肥、浅灌勤灌、防治病虫害等7大技术外，还要积极推广双季稻、连作稻。同时要扩大土地利用率，推广高产作物。据调查，全省还有100万亩的秋闲地和150万亩的低产杂粮田。此外，占全省土地71％的山区还有很大面积可以扩种山玉米、山甘薯和马铃薯等。如把这些土地都利用来扩种和改种高产作物，就可为国家增产大批粮食。同时还必须积极地推广优良品种，多方面打开肥源，兴修农田水利，推广新式农具等。要把这些工作做好，党组织必须同农业技术改革中的保守思想作斗争。
    会议认为，克服保守思想的关键在于各级党委，首先是党委书记，深入下层，深入实际，研究问题，解决问题，总结“千斤粮、万斤薯、百斤棉”的增产经验加以推广。只有这样，才能在增产运动中保持清醒的头脑，把运动引向高潮。
