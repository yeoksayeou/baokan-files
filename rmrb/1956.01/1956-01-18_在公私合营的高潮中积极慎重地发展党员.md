Amidst the socialist transformation movement of capitalist industry and commerce, the Communist Party branches and members originally distributed in private industrial and commercial enterprises played a significant role. Especially in the current high tide of joint public-private ownership, these Party branches and members are even more actively leading the workers and staff to prepare for various tasks and ensure the smooth progress of joint operation. Recently, there have been many vivid examples in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other cities. For example, the Party branch of the Sanyang Flour Mill in Beijing has actively led workers and staff over the years to overfulfill the state's processing and ordering tasks. Party member Zhang Maolin (municipal model worker) took the lead in studying technology and continuously improving the wheat flour yield, saving the state 850,000 jin of wheat in three years. Recently, when the entire industry implemented joint public-private ownership, the Party branch led the workers and staff to make all preparations and selected the factory director who was the public shareholder representative from the Party members in the factory.

However, we must also see that the number of Party members in private industrial and commercial enterprises was originally small, and their distribution was very uneven: there are slightly more Party members in factories, and very few in stores; slightly more in large factories and stores, and very few in small factories and stores, and some important industries have no Party members. According to statistics from November 1955, Tianjin had 7,949 private factories with a total of 84,924 workers and staff, of which only 2,673 Party members were in 873 factories, and Party members in six industries such as vehicle tools, rubber, and leather in seven districts accounted for more than 26% of the total number of Party members in private factories. There were 9,060 private stores with a total of 32,222 workers and staff, of which there were 344 Party members, distributed in 163 stores, and Party members in five industries such as department stores and pastry shops in seven districts accounted for more than 34% of the total number of Party members in private commerce. The situation in other cities is roughly the same. This situation is clearly not commensurate with the needs of the developing situation. Currently, the high tide of the entire industry-wide implementation of joint public-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce has arrived. This, on the one hand, requires the original Party branches and members in these enterprises to play a greater role; on the other hand, it requires actively and prudently developing new Party members in these enterprises, expanding the Party's ranks, so as to more powerfully guarantee the victorious completion of the task of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

Some comrades believe that our focus on developing Party members should still be placed on state-owned enterprises. Therefore, they are actually relaxing the work of developing Party members in joint public-private enterprises. Some comrades also believe that as long as there is leadership from the municipal and district committees, the "transformation can be done well" for private industry and commerce, and the number of Party members does not matter. This idea ignores the fortress role of the Party's grassroots organizations in the process of implementing socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. This is a completely wrong idea. Facts in the past and present show that wherever there are Party organizations and Party members, the work of joint public-private ownership proceeds more smoothly and is done better. Although many private enterprises have carried out joint public-private ownership without Party members, it should be admitted that after all private industry and commerce has implemented joint public-private ownership, there is still much work to be done, especially when carrying out economic reorganization and adjusting the commercial network. Without the backbone role of the Party's grassroots organizations and Party members, the work will inevitably encounter many difficulties. Some comrades also believe that the class consciousness of workers and staff in private enterprises, especially in small and medium-sized factories and stores, is not high, and they do not have the conditions for developing Party members. This view is certainly incorrect. Over the years, after many political movements, especially the "Five-Anti" movement and the Party's publicity of the general line for the transition period, the class consciousness of workers and staff in private enterprises has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and a large number of activists have emerged. As long as we adopt an active and prudent attitude, pay attention to selecting targets, and further provide systematic education, the conditions for developing Party members in these enterprises are fully present. The Xuanwu District Committee of Beijing has paid more attention to the work of developing Party members in private factories since 1952. In more than three years, it has developed a total of 404 new Party members, breaking through 48 "blank spots," and newly established 29 branches. Moreover, the vast majority of Party members developed meet the requirements. In the recent high tide of the entire private industry and commerce implementing joint public-private ownership, these many Party members have played a huge role. In the future enterprise reorganization and adjustment work, these many Party members will certainly continue to play a greater role.

Of course, there will be some objective difficulties in developing Party members in private enterprises without Party members. But these difficulties can be overcome. According to the existing experience in Beijing and Tianjin, in developing Party members in private enterprises, first of all, it is necessary to organize forces from all aspects (Party member cadres in trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, etc.) to discover and select activists in political movements and daily work, and to promptly cultivate and educate them. According to existing experience in various places, there are various methods of cultivation and education, such as amateur training courses, training courses away from production, discussion meetings, and individual talks. Amateur training courses can use three or four months to conduct education on communism and the Communist Party for activists through amateur large classes and group discussions in connection with reality. Training courses away from production are for concentrated training to solve the common problems of some people (such as some people basically meet the conditions for joining the Party, but still need to be educated, etc.). This kind of training course is more concentrated and systematic than the previous one, but it takes more production time (the wages of activists in private enterprises during the training period can be reimbursed by the Party committee). Generally, activists who have studied in training courses have initially established a correct outlook on life and have a further understanding of communism and the Communist Party. Therefore, it lays the foundation for the work of developing Party members. Of course, while carrying out collective training, we should also convene discussion meetings or conduct individual talks by full-time cadres of the organization department of the district committee or the Party branch to specifically solve some problems according to the ideological problems of one person or several people. We must also pay close attention to reviewing development targets, and the history of each development target must be thoroughly reviewed, and there must be sufficient corroborating materials. Their work, ideology, quality, and position must also be strictly examined, and bad elements must be strictly prevented from entering the Party.

When the capitalist industry and commerce transformation movement in various places has reached a climax, the Party committees in various places should make plans for developing Party members in these enterprises. This method of carrying out this work with leadership and preparation is very necessary. Places that have not carried out such planning should make plans as soon as possible in order to strengthen the Party's strength and ensure that the historical task of carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce can be completed successfully and victoriously.

### 在公私合营的高潮中积极慎重地发展党员

    在公私合营的高潮中积极慎重地发展党员
    在资本主义工商业的社会主义改造运动中，原来分布在私营工商业企业中的共产党支部和党员，发挥了很大的作用，尤其是在目前公私合营的高潮中，这些党支部和党员同志更加积极地带动工人、职员群众做好各项准备工作，保证合营工作顺利进行。北京、天津、上海及其他城市最近都有许多生动的例子。如北京私营三阳面粉厂党支部，几年来积极领导工人职员超额完成了国家加工定货任务，党员张茂林（市劳动模范）带头钻研技术，不断提高麦子出粉率，3年中为国家节约麦子85万斤；最近全行业实行公私合营的时候，党支部领导工人职员把一切准备工作作好，并且从厂里党员中选拔了公股代表的厂长。
      但是，我们还必须看到，私营工商业企业中党员的数量本来就不多，而且分布得很不平衡：工厂中党员稍多，商店中很少；大厂大店中稍多，小厂小店中很少，有些重要行业没有党员。根据1955年11月的统计，天津市有私营工厂7，949家，共有工人职员84，924人，其中仅仅873个厂共有党员2，673人，而7个区的车具、橡胶、制革等6个行业中的党员就占私营工厂党员总数26％强。私营商店9，060家，共有工人职员32，222人，其中党员344人，分布在163家商店，而7个区的百货、糕点等5个行业中的党员就占私营商业中党员总数的34％强。其他城市的情况也大致相同。这种情况显然和形势发展的需要很不相称。目前，资本主义工商业整行整业地实行公私合营的高潮已经到来了。这就在一方面要求这些企业中原有的党支部、党员发挥更大的作用；另一方面要求积极慎重地在这些企业中发展新党员，扩大党的队伍，以便更有力地保证对私营工商业的社会主义改造的任务胜利完成。
    有些同志认为：我们发展党员的重点仍然应该放在国营企业。因此，他们在实际上还是放松了在公私合营企业中发展党员的工作。还有些同志认为：对于私营工商业，只要有市委、区委的领导就可以“搞好改造”，党员多少没有什么关系。这种想法忽视了党的基层组织在对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造过程中的堡垒作用。这是完全错误的想法。无论过去或现在的事实都表明，哪里有党的组织和党员，哪里的公私合营的工作就进行得更顺利，就作得更好。虽然有许多私营企业没有党员也进行了公私合营，但是应当承认，在私营工商业全部实行了公私合营以后，还有很多工作要作，特别是在进行经济改组和调整商业网的时候，如果没有党的基层组织和党员起骨干作用，工作就一定会遇到许多困难。还有些同志认为：私营企业，特别是中、小工厂和商店中职工的阶级觉悟不高，不具备发展党员的条件。这种看法当然是不对的。几年以来，经过多次的政治运动，特别是“五反”运动和党在过渡时期总路线的宣传，私营企业中的工人职员的阶级觉悟空前提高，涌现出大批的积极分子。只要我们采取积极慎重的态度，注意选拔对象，并且进一步给予系统的教育，在这些企业中，发展党员的条件是完全存在的。北京宣武区区委，从1952年以来，比较重视了在私营工厂中发展党员的工作，3年多共发展了404名新党员，突破了48个“空白点”，新建立了29个支部，而且所发展的党员绝大多数都合乎条件，在最近全部私营工商业实行公私合营的高潮中，这许多党员发挥了巨大的作用。在今后的企业改组和调整工作中，这许多党员一定还会继续发挥更大的作用。
    在没有党员的私营企业中发展党员，当然会有一些客观困难。但是这些困难是可以克服的。根据北京、天津已有的经验，在私营企业中发展党员，首先要组织各方面的力量（工会、青年团组织中的党员干部等）在政治运动和日常工作中发现和选拔积极分子，并且抓紧培养、教育他们。根据各地已有经验，培养、教育的方法有业余训练班、脱离生产的训练班、座谈会和个别谈话等多种。业余训练班可用三、四个月的时间，通过业余上大课和分组联系实际进行讨论，向积极分子进行关于共产主义和共产党的教育。脱离生产的训练班是为了解决一部分人带共同性的问题（如一些人已基本具备入党条件、但是仍然需要进行教育等等），而进行的集中训练。这种训练班比前一种进行的教育更加集中和系统，但是它耽误生产时间多（私营企业中积极分子受训期间工薪可由党委报销）。经过训练班学习的积极分子，一般的都初步树立了正确的人生观，对共产主义和共产党有了进一步的认识。因此，就为发展党员的工作打下了基础。当然，在集体训练的同时，还应该针对一个人或几个人的思想问题，由区委组织部专职干部或者党支部召集座谈会或进行个别谈话，以便更具体地解决一些问题。还必须十分注意审查发展对象，对每个发展对象的历史都要经过详细的审查，要有充分的旁证材料。对他们的工作、思想意识、品质和立场也要进行严格的考察，严格防止坏分子混入党内。
    在各地资本主义工商业改造运动达到了高潮的时候，各地党委应该作出在这些企业中发展党员的规划。这种有领导有准备地进行这项工作的方法十分必要。没有进行这种规划的地方，要早日作出规划，以便壮大党的力量，保证对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的历史任务能够完满地胜利完成。
