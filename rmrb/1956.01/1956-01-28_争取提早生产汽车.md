Striving for Early Automobile Production
Deputy Director and Deputy Chief Engineer of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Meng Shaonong

After studying Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the Central Committee's instructions on opposing right-leaning tendencies and overcoming conservative thinking, the cadres, workers, and technicians of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant immediately thought: the state's need for automobiles will increase, can we produce automobiles earlier?

At the end of 1955, we, together with Soviet experts, inspected the progress of factory construction and production preparation, and the answer we reached was affirmative.

In the past two and a half years, under the leadership of the Party and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, the First Automobile Plant has made rapid progress in construction, installation, and production preparation. In terms of construction, except for a few interior projects in the last batch of factory buildings and the factory area roads, it has been basically completed. In terms of installation, 82% of the total equipment has been completed, and many workshops and power stations are in operation. In terms of production preparation, the organization and personnel are basically in place; the supply of tools, materials, and collaborative products has a preliminary foundation; the auxiliary production force has been established and is growing daily; most of the basic workshops have entered or are entering production adjustment, and the first automotive assembly (rear axle reducer) produced during the adjustment process has passed the driving test. On this basis, further improving our work and completing the plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target are conditional.

According to the original overall plan, the first batch of 100 automobiles should be produced at the beginning of the fourth quarter of this year. However, today, looking back, it should be said that it has great defects. The main one is that the deadline for putting the entire factory into production is very late (from the trial assembly of the first assembly to the official production of automobiles is one year), which prevents the productive forces from rapidly playing their role, and will therefore cause huge losses.

Of course, a new factory must go through a difficult period of mastering production technology in the early stages of production. During this period, the consumption and loss of productive forces and means of production within a certain limit is precisely the price that must be paid to achieve high production efficiency in the future. However, the slowness of the production period in our original plan exceeded this range. The emergence of this shortcoming is mainly due to the disconnection of the construction progress of some workshops and the inappropriate handling methods we adopted.

The construction procedure of the automobile factory is: the auxiliary workshops and some basic production workshops are constructed first; the other basic production workshops are constructed later, and their progress differs from the previous batch by about two or three quarters. It is correct to build auxiliary workshops first; due to difficulties in design order, construction forces, and material and equipment supply, it is also possible to construct basic workshops in two batches, one before the other. However, the complex production problems caused by the disconnection of construction progress must be remedied in the production preparation and commissioning plan.

The most serious problem in the workshops built in the later batch is the foundry. Among the main factory buildings in the entire plant, its earthwork and installation workload is the largest, and the number of domestically manufactured non-standard equipment required is the largest. By the end of 1955, this factory still had a lot of civil construction finishing work, more than half of the mechanical installation work, and most of the power installation work remaining. According to the original plan, the installation of the foundry would be completed in September this year, and the production of all castings would have to wait until the beginning of next year.

The progress of the foundry has been considered the key to determining the date of automobile production since the planning of the factory construction began in 1952. In order to overcome the production adjustment difficulties caused by the contradiction that it is the first to produce but the last to be built, it was decided to postpone the time for putting the previous batch of workshops into production, waiting for the later batch of workshops, including the foundry, to catch up. This is why the original schedule stipulated that automobile production would not begin until the fourth quarter of this year.

This "insurance" plan created a sense of reassurance in the factory. Over time, a contradictory phenomenon appeared in the factory. On the one hand, everyone believed that the task of producing automobiles was arduous, but on the other hand, the workshops that had already switched to production felt that the task was too small, and the workshops adopted methods such as long-term study of documents and repeated adjustment of machine tools to kill time. These phenomena proved that the waiting policy bound the power of progress and hindered the growth of workers and cadres. In auxiliary workshops, people even worried that the task was not enough, feared the backlog of tools and dies, and considered accepting more external orders.

Is there a positive and feasible way to overcome the disconnection of construction progress? Yes. This is to concentrate forces, take various measures, and accelerate the construction speed of the later batch of construction workshops. Recently, a deputy chief engineer from the Soviet Stalin Automobile Factory came to our factory to coordinate work and proposed this method.

We adopted a relatively "safe" method of accommodating the backward because we considered negative factors more and positive factors less, and underestimated the possibility of overcoming the disconnection phenomenon; at the same time, we believed that to emphasize planning in industrial construction and production, we must calmly arrange all conditions in advance. In essence, this is to reduce subjective effort and attempt to live a comfortable life. This ideological tendency dominated our minds when we lacked experience and encountered more difficulties in our work.

After studying the Central Committee's instructions, our understanding has been improved, and the defects of the original progress plan are very obvious. Under the inspiration of Soviet comrades, we have taken three measures for the later batch of workshops.

The first measure is to speed up the progress of capital construction, especially the progress of installation engineering. In the past, the slow installation progress was mainly due to: the lack of unified leadership between civil construction and installation, which often did not cooperate with each other; the ordering work was not done well, and the delivery of domestic non-standard equipment was often delayed; the various types of work in the installation were often disconnected; the contradictions between various designs could not be discovered in time and caused rework; the installation force was scattered, and the project could not be completed in time. These shortcomings can be completely corrected. Based on this consideration, we plan to advance the completion date of the foundry installation by one quarter.

The second measure is to carry out production adjustment and installation in an interleaved manner as much as possible, so that the entire adjustment period is advanced. In order to start adjusting production when the installation is not completed, it is necessary to strictly control the installation operation plan and ensure that all the conditions required for the adjustment are available at the same time (complete sets of equipment, supporting power systems, work and auxiliary ground, etc.). This production control of the installation plan was established at the suggestion of experts. However, in the specific implementation, the production department often fails to put forward or adhere to the primary and secondary order of equipment and the order of needs; under the pressure of civil construction and equipment conditions, the capital construction department sometimes does not install according to the required order in order to complete the planned workload, often installing some non-urgent or unimportant equipment first, while the urgent ones are not installed. This time we have re-emphasized the purpose of installation and specifically arranged the tasks with the help of experts. The foundry was originally scheduled to start adjustment in July, and after taking this measure, one conveyor belt each for gray and malleable iron castings was advanced to the end of March for adjustment and casting.

The third measure is to compress the time for adjusting production. After five months of actual adjustment work, we have some understanding of the characteristics of production adjustment in our factory. It can be said that the specific conditions of our factory are superior because: 1. The structure of the product and the production process are correct and reliable, which laid a solid foundation for production preparation and adjustment; 2. The special machine tools and tools supplied by the Soviet Union have been adjusted in the Soviet Union and trial-produced qualified parts, and there are no major technological problems left for us to solve; 3. Most of the steel and main blanks currently used in our adjustment are still supplied by the Soviet Union, so the processing workshop rarely encounters material quality problems; 4. The auxiliary production force of our factory, especially the tool manufacturing force, has been established before the basic workshop began to adjust, providing a strong guarantee for production adjustment; 5. There is the guidance of Soviet experts in technology, the personnel who have been to the Soviet Union for internship as the backbone, and the participation of excellent workers supported by brother factories, and the strength is relatively strong. With these superior conditions, coupled with the high enthusiasm of the workers, cadres, and engineering and technical personnel, it has been carried out smoothly despite the heavy tasks and lack of experience, and the abilities of workers, cadres, and engineering and technical personnel have been significantly improved, exceeding our original estimates in all aspects.

Measuring the production adjustment of the later batch of workshops with these experiences, at least the production adjustment time of the processing workshop can be greatly compressed. The more difficult is the foundry workshop, because the material problem there is serious, and the experience of the processing workshop is not fully applicable to it. In response to this situation, we decided to advance the adjustment of the foundry workshop as much as possible, strengthen technical preparation, overcome difficulties, and catch up with the deadline for producing castings.

After taking the above three measures, the deadline for producing the first batch of automobiles can be advanced. The task stipulated in the Five-Year Plan can be completed ahead of schedule or exceeded.

The current serious task is: we must immediately organize forces and take action. In previous years, there was always a period of relaxation at the beginning of the year, but this year it will not work. In addition, the production of many brother factories and mines across the country is connected to automobile production, and without the efforts of the workers in these factories and mines, automobiles still cannot be produced. We will strive to strengthen our connection with brother enterprises, obtain their cooperation, and jointly strive to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule!

    争取提早生产汽车
    第一汽车制造厂副厂长兼副总工程师　孟少农
    学习了毛主席的“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中央关于反对右倾克服保守思想的指示以后，第一汽车制造厂的干部、工人和技术人员马上想到的是：国家需要的汽车将要加多了，我们能不能提早生产出汽车来？
    1955年年底我们会同苏联专家检查了建厂和生产准备的进度，得出的答案是肯定的。
    过去两年半中，在党的领导和苏联的援助下，第一汽车厂在建筑、安装、生产准备各方面的进展是很快的。在建筑方面，除了最后一批厂房的少数室内工程和厂区道路外，已经基本完工。在安装方面，已经完成设备总数的82％，许多车间和动力站都已运转。在生产准备方面，组织和人员已经基本具备；工具、材料和协作产品的供应已有初步基础；辅助生产力量已经建立并逐日成长；大部分基本车间已进入或正进入生产调整，在调整过程中制出的第一个汽车总成（后桥减速器）已经通过了行驶试验。在这个基础上，进一步提高我们的工作，提前和超额完成计划是有条件的。
    按照原来的总体计划，今年第四季度初应当出产首批100辆汽车。但是，今天来检查，应当说它有很大的缺陷。主要的是：全厂投入生产的期限很迟（从试装出第一个总成到正式出产汽车计有一年），使生产力不能迅速发挥作用，因此将造成巨大的损失。
    当然，新建厂在生产初期总要经过一段艰苦的掌握生产技术的时期，在这个时期里所受的一定限度的生产力和生产资料的消耗和损失，正是为以后达到高度生产效率所必须付出的代价。但是，我们原计划中生产期限的迟缓，超出了这个范围。这个缺点的产生，主要是由于某些车间建设进度脱节和我们采取了不妥当的处理方法。
    汽车厂建设的程序是：各辅助车间和部分基本生产车间先施工；另一部分基本生产车间后施工，其进度和前批相差约两三个季度。辅助车间先建是正确的；由于设计顺序、施工力量、材料设备供应等方面的困难，基本车间分前后两批建设也是可以的。但是，对因建设进度的脱节所引起的生产上的复杂问题，必须在生产准备和投入生产的计划中加以补救。
    后批建设的车间中问题最严重的是铸工场。在全厂主要场房中，它的土方和安装工作量最大，所需国内制造的非标准设备最多。到1955年底，这个工场还剩有不少的土建收尾工程、过半的机械安装工程和大部的动力安装工程。按照原计划，铸工场的安装要在今年九月结束，而全部铸件的生产则要等到明年初。
    铸工场的进度，从1952年开始规划建厂工作起，一直被认为是决定出车期限的关键。为了克服由于它生产最先而建成最后的矛盾所造成的生产调整的困难，曾决定推迟前批车间投入生产的时间，等待包括铸工场在内的后批车间赶上来。这就是原进度规定今年第四季度才开始生产汽车的原因。
    这个“保险”计划，在厂中造成了可以放心的情绪。日子久了，厂内出现一种矛盾现象。一方面，大家都认为生产汽车任务艰巨，另一方面，已经转入生产的车间却感觉任务太少，车间里采取了长期学习文件、反复调整机床等消磨时间的办法。这些现象判明，等待的方针束缚了前进的力量，妨碍了工人和干部的成长。在辅助车间里，人们甚至担心任务不够，害怕工具冲模积压，考虑要接受较多的厂外订货。
    有没有积极可行的克服建设进度脱节的办法呢？有的。这就是集中力量，采取各种措施，加速后批建设车间的建设速度。最近苏联斯大林汽车厂一位副总工程师来我厂联系工作，就提出了这种办法。
    我们采取比较“保险”的迁就落后的办法，是因为我们考虑消极因素多，考虑积极因素少，对克服脱节现象的可能性估计不足；同时我们认为在工业建设和生产中要强调计划性，就必须从容不迫地把一切条件都事先安排妥贴。实质上，这是想减轻主观努力，企图过安逸的日子。这种思想倾向当我们缺少经验、工作中遇到较多的困难，就在脑子里占了优势。
    学习了中央指示文件后，我们的认识有了提高，原进度计划的缺陷就很显著了。在苏联同志的启发下，我们对后批车间采取了三方面的措施。
    第一个措施是加快基建进度、特别是安装工程的进度。过去安装进度缓慢的主要原因是：土建和安装缺乏统一领导，常常互不配合；订货工作做得不好，国内非标准设备交货常常脱期，安装的各工种之间时常脱节，各项设计之间的矛盾不能及时发现而造成返工，安装力量分散，工程不能及时结束。这些缺点是完全可以改正的。根据这方面的考虑，我们预定把铸工场的安装竣工期提前一季。
    第二个措施是尽量把生产调整和安装交错进行，使整个调整期间提前。为要在安装未完时开始调整生产，必须严格控制安装作业计划，保证同时具备调整所需的全部条件（成套设备、配合的动力系统、工作和辅助地面等）。这种生产对安装计划的控制，我们曾在专家建议下建立过。但是在具体执行中，生产部门常提不出或不能坚持设备的主次和需要的先后顺序；基建部门在土建和设备条件的压力下，为要完成计划工作量，有时不按需要顺序安装，往往把一些不迫切需要的或不重要的设备先装了，迫切需要的反而没安装。这一次我们又重新强调了安装的目的性，并且在专家的帮助下具体安排了任务。铸工场原来预定在7月开始调整，采取这个措施后，就使灰色和可锻铸件的各一条输送带提前到3月底调整浇铸。
    第三个措施是压缩调整生产的时间。经过五个月的实际调整工作后，我们对本厂生产调整的特点有了一些了解。可以说我厂的具体条件是优越的，因为：一、产品的结构和生产工艺是正确可靠的，它们为生产准备和调整打下了坚实的基础；二、苏联供应的特种机床和工具曾在苏联调整过并试制过合格件，没有留给我们解决的重大工艺问题；三、当前我们调整中使用的大部分钢材和主要毛胚还是苏联供给的，因此加工车间很少遭遇材料质量问题；四、我厂的辅助生产、特别是工具制造力量，已经在基本车间开始调整前建立，为生产调整提供了坚强的保证；五、技术上有苏联专家的指导，有曾去苏联实习的人员为骨干，有兄弟厂支援的优秀工人参加，力量是较强的。有了这些优越条件，再加上职工群众高涨的积极性，所以在任务重、经验少的条件下仍进行得很顺利，而且工人、干部、工程技术人员的能力都有显著的提高，在各方面都超出了我们原来的估计。
    拿这些经验来衡量后批车间的生产调整，至少可以大大压缩加工车间的生产调整时间。比较困难的是铸工车间，因为那里材料问题严重，加工车间的经验对它又不完全适用。针对这一情况，我们决定将铸工车间的调整尽量提早，加强技术准备，克服困难，把生产铸件的期限赶上来。
    在采取了上述三项措施后，就可以把生产首批汽车的期限提前。就可以提前或超额完成五年计划规定的任务。
    当前的严重任务是：必须立刻组织力量、行动起来。往年每到年初总有一段松劲的时间，今年这样就不行了。此外，全国许多兄弟厂矿的生产和汽车生产是一脉相连的，没有这些厂矿的工人的努力，汽车仍旧出不来。我们将努力加强跟兄弟企业的联系，取得它们的配合，共同为全面地提早完成和超额完成五年计划而奋斗！
