To the Editor:

    In many places, due to poor management of sweet potato cellars, stored sweet potatoes often suffer from cold damage in the later stages. Now, I would like to introduce some things to pay attention to when managing sweet potato cellars for your reference:

    The temperature inside the sweet potato cellar should be maintained between 12 and 15 degrees Celsius. To regularly monitor the cellar temperature, a thermometer can be inserted through the cover grass on the sweet potato pile and into the gaps between the sweet potatoes. Check it every five to seven days. If the temperature of the sweet potato pile drops below 12 degrees Celsius, the thickness of the cover grass should be increased (use finely chopped grass, three to five inches thick, and compress it). If the temperature of the sweet potato pile is lower than nine degrees Celsius, you should immediately check whether the sweet potatoes have suffered cold damage (the skin has sunken rotten spots or the ends are rotten; when broken open by hand, there are black veins inside without white pulp; when squeezed by hand, yellow water flows out; the sweet potato core hardens when cooked). Sweet potatoes that have suffered cold damage are not suitable for continued storage. If only a part of the surface of the sweet potato pile has suffered cold damage, all the cold-damaged sweet potatoes can be removed, and then the thickness of the cover grass should be increased on the remaining sweet potato pile, paying attention to keeping it warm. If the cellar temperature rises to around 25 degrees, the reason for the temperature increase must be checked. If the sweet potatoes have developed black spot disease, they should be dealt with quickly (steamed for eating or processed into flour); if the cover grass is too thick, it should be reduced appropriately.

    Different sweet potato cellars should be managed according to their different characteristics. If the cellar walls of above-ground cellars that protrude above the ground are too thin, the sweet potatoes will not be able to survive the winter safely. In the North China region, the cellar walls should be kept about three feet thick, and soil must be added around the sweet potato cellar before the severe cold arrives. In the later stages, well cellars should pay attention to covering the cellar opening, and shallow cellars should be covered with grass shirts, etc., and then pressed with bricks and stones to prevent them from being blown open by the wind. In North China, the weather is colder from the end of December to the beginning of February. The air vents of the well cellar should also be covered to prevent the cellar temperature from being too low. Shallow cellars and shallow well cellars less than 15 feet deep should pay special attention to keeping warm. When the sweet potato temperature drops below 14 degrees, it is necessary to cover the grass in time, especially the grass on the four sides of the cellar wall should be thickened.

    介绍薯窖后期管理的一些办法编辑同志：
    不少地方因为对薯窖管理得不好，贮藏的甘薯在后期常常发生冷害现象。现在我介绍一些管理薯窖应该注意的事项，供大家参考：
    薯窖里的温度应该保持在摄氏12度到15度之间。为了经常掌握窖温，可以把一个温度计穿过薯堆上的盖草，插在薯缝里，每五天到七天拿出检查一次。如果薯堆温度降到摄氏12度以下，就应该增加盖草厚度（盖草用碎细的草，厚三到五寸，要压紧）。如果薯堆温度低于摄氏九度，应该立刻检查薯块是否受了冷害（表皮有凹下的烂斑或两头腐烂；用手掰开，里面有黑筋而没有白浆；用手一捏就有黄水流出；煮食的时候薯心发硬）。受冷害的甘薯就不宜继续贮藏。如果薯堆只有表面一部分受了冷害，可以把受冷害的薯块全部取出来，然后在留下的薯堆上增加盖草厚度，注意保温。如果窖温升高到25度左右，就必须检查温度升高的原因。要是甘薯发生了黑斑病，就应该赶快处理（蒸吃或加工磨粉）；要是盖草太厚，就应该适当减少。
    对于不同的薯窖，应该根据不同的特点来管理。地上窖高出地面的窖壁如果太薄了，甘薯就不能安全地过冬。华北一带，窖壁应该保持三尺左右厚，在严寒未到来以前就必须在薯窖四周加土。井窖在后期应该注意盖窖口，浅窖上要用草衫等盖上，再压上砖头石块等，防止被风吹开。华北一带12月底到2月初天气较冷，井窖的气眼也要盖起来，以免窖温过低。不到15尺深的浅窖和浅井窖，应该特别注意保温，在薯温降到14度以下的时候，就需要及时盖草，特别是靠窖壁的四边草要加厚一些。
