The phenomenon of district and township cadres in Jing County, Hunan Province, arbitrarily transferring staff from credit cooperatives to engage in other work is very common. When the county was carrying out the "Three Fixes" work for grain, it transferred more than half of the accountants from the county's credit cooperatives to be calculators. Although the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee has repeatedly instructed various localities not to arbitrarily transfer personnel from credit cooperatives, some agencies still do not seriously implement this. For example, recently the county Grain Bureau needed to hire some personnel, and also drew them from the credit cooperatives, and said that this was to "take care of overall interests." This practice has seriously weakened the business of the credit cooperatives, and many credit cooperatives cannot recover overdue loans in time, and the balance of deposits has generally declined. Some staff members of credit cooperatives in this county are experiencing great ideological fluctuations and are not at ease with their work because they cannot concentrate on their duties.

    这不是照顾整体利益
    湖南省靖县区、乡干部随便抽调信用社工作人员搞其它业务的现象很普遍。这个县在搞粮食“三定”工作的时候，就把全县一半以上的信用社的会计抽调出来当计算员。虽然省委农村工作部曾经一再指示各地不要随便抽调信用社的工作人员，但是有些机关还是不认真执行。例如，最近县粮食局需要雇用一些人员，也从信用社里抽，并且说这是为了“照顾整体利益”。这种做法已经严重地削弱了信用社的业务，许多信用社不能及时收回到期贷款，存款余额普遍下降。这个县有些信用社的工作人员因为不能专心业务，思想波动很大，不安心工作。
