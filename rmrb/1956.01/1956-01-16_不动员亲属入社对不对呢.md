    Is It Right Not to Encourage Relatives to Join the Cooperative?
    Zheng Qi

    In the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, all Party and state organ workers whose families are in the countryside should, without shirking responsibility, persuade their family members and relatives to take the lead in joining cooperatives in order to promote the advancement of this movement. However, a few Party and state organ workers are taking a "hands-off" attitude towards the issue of whether their family members and relatives join cooperatives, and some individuals are intentionally or unintentionally preventing their family members and relatives from joining. According to a survey in late November of last year, among the 44 CCP district committee members in Taojiang County, Hunan Province, the family members and relatives of 38 people had not joined cooperatives. Among them, 32 people took a "hands-off" attitude, and 6 people even "advised" their family members and relatives not to join. This phenomenon also exists in Hebei Province. Liu Yichang, a cadre of the Organization and Education Section of the Tangshan Prefectural Party Committee School of the CCP, wrote to his family saying: "According to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, it is not against the law for our family to join the cooperative later." Is it really not against the law? It depends on who you are talking about. For a Communist Party member, although it does not violate state laws, it violates the Party's policy decisions. Because the Constitution of the Communist Party of China already has such provisions: "Strictly abide by Party discipline, actively participate in Party political life and domestic revolutionary movements, practically implement Party policies and the resolutions of Party organizations, and struggle against all phenomena inside and outside the Party that harm the Party's interests." Comrade Liu Yichang has forgotten that agricultural cooperativization is an integral part of the Party's general line and a major component of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party; he has also forgotten a condition that a Communist Party member must possess – to exemplarily implement the policies and laws of the Party and the state.

    Why do these district committee members spend all day in the countryside persuading peasants to take the socialist road, but do not persuade their own family members and relatives to take the socialist road, or even prevent them from doing so? Why does a Communist Party member think it is legal not to encourage family members and relatives to join the cooperative? Do they not understand the Party's policies? No, they know the Party's policies and general principles, and can even talk about them at length. The problem is that these people have developed bourgeois selfish individualistic sentiments, and thus intentionally or unintentionally help their families take the capitalist road. For Party members, is this not a major error of principle?

    不动员亲属入社对不对呢
    郑起
    在热火朝天的农业合作化高潮中，一切家在农村的党和国家机关的工作人员，都应当义不容辞地劝导自己的家庭亲属带头参加合作社，以便推动这一运动前进。但是，竟有少数党和国家机关的工作人员对家庭亲属入社不入社的问题采取不闻不问的态度，也有个别的人有意无意地阻止家庭亲属入社。据去年11月下旬的调查，湖南省桃江县44个中共区委委员中，就有38人的家庭亲属没有入社，其中32人是不闻不问，还有6人甚至“劝导”家庭亲属不要入社。河北省也有这种现象。中共唐山地委党校组织教育科干事刘义昌就给家里写信说：“根据自愿互利原则，咱家晚入社也不犯法。”真的不犯法吗？这要看对谁来说。这对共产党员来说，虽然没有违犯国家的法令，但是却违犯了党的政策决定。因为在中国共产党党章中早已有这样的规定：“严格地遵守党纪，积极参加党内的政治生活和国内的革命运动，实际执行党的政策和党的组织的决议，和党内党外一切损害党的利益的现象进行斗争”。刘义昌同志却忘记了农业合作化是党的总路线的一个组成部分，是党的七届六中全会（扩大）决议的主要内容；他也还忘记了作为一个共产党员所必须具备的一个条件——模范地执行党和国家的政策法令。
    为什么这些区委委员整天在农村劝导农民走社会主义的道路，而不劝导自己的家庭亲属走社会主义道路甚至还加以阻止呢？为什么一个共产党员不劝导家庭亲属入社还认为是合法的呢？他们是不懂得党的政策吗？不，党的政策和一般道理，他们都是知道的，甚至还能说一大套。问题就在于这些人已经滋长着资产阶级的自私自利的个人主义情绪，因而有意无意地帮助家庭走资本主义道路。对党员来说，这难道不是一个重大的原则性的错误吗？
