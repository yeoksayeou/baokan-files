    85% of Vegetable Farmers in Wuhan Join Cooperatives
    Nearly two hundred semi-socialist vegetable production cooperatives and 17 fully socialist advanced vegetable production cooperatives have been newly established in the suburbs of Wuhan. About 85% of the total number of vegetable farmers in the entire suburban area have joined the cooperatives. These vegetable cooperatives were established in a very short period of time after December 9, 1955. At present, the number of peasant households in the suburbs of Wuhan that have joined cooperatives accounts for more than 80% of the total number of peasant households, basically realizing semi-socialist agricultural cooperation.
    With the development of industrial construction in the Wuhan area, the population of Wuhan has continued to increase, and the demand for vegetables and other non-staple foods has greatly increased. Last year, 40% of the vegetables consumed in the city were transferred from other places. After the realization of agricultural cooperation, due to the change in production relations and the vigorous promotion of advanced technologies such as artificial pollination and hotbed breeding, the vegetable output in the suburbs of Wuhan this year will reach 400 million catties, a twofold increase compared to last year, which can basically meet the needs of Wuhan.

    武汉85％的菜农入社
    武汉市郊区已经新建立了将近二百个半社会主义的蔬菜生产合作社和
  17个完全社会主义的高级蔬菜生产合作社，入社菜农占全郊区菜农总户的85％左右。这些蔬菜社是在1955年12月9日以后很短的时间内建立起来的。目前，武汉市郊区农民入社户数已经占农户总数的80％以上，基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。
    随着武汉地区工业建设的发展，武汉市人口不断增加，蔬菜等副食品需要量大增，去年全市消费的蔬菜，有40％从外地调来。实现农业合作化以后，由于生产关系改变，以及大力推行人工授粉、温床育苗等先进技术，今年武汉郊区的蔬菜产量将要达到四亿斤，比去年提高一倍，基本上可以满足武汉市的需要。　（袁军）
