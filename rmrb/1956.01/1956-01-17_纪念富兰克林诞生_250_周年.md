    250 years ago (1706), on January 17th, Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston, America. Today, progressive people all over the world are commemorating this outstanding American statesman and physicist. Franklin was a man of versatile development. He demonstrated astonishing talent in journalism, diplomatic work, and scientific research. At the same time, he was also a skilled swimmer. He lived to be 84 years old and published works continuously for 68 years. He was interested in all problems. In addition to physics, he also studied meteorology, natural history, geology, chemistry, mechanics, agronomy, and mathematics. His writings on paper money were highly praised by Marx. He improved the design of fireplaces and street lamps, invented the lightning rod and bifocal glasses, and founded public libraries and fire brigades. He offered important opinions on navigation, road construction, street sweeping, police work, house ventilation, and education. His spirit of pursuing truth and his concise and powerful writing made a deep impression on people. In 1766, Hume called Franklin the first philosopher and first great scholar of the New World. Until the beginning of the 20th century, no one in the United States except Lincoln had a reputation abroad comparable to Franklin's.
    Franklin was born into a poor family. His father, Josiah, originally dyed wool. In 1685, he immigrated to Boston from England to escape religious persecution and switched to making tallow candles. Benjamin was the youngest son (the tenth). He attended school for two years. At the age of ten, he helped his father at home "cutting candle wicks, pouring candle molds, watching the shop, running errands, etc." At the age of 12, he became an apprentice at a printing shop. Until the age of 40, he worked in printing and publishing. Franklin became a rare all-round talent in history mainly due to his consistent hard self-study and the help of friends over the years.
    In the field of natural science, Franklin's contribution lies not only in a large number of historically significant research works, but more importantly, he pioneered experimental physics. His research method of conducting a large number of experiments and summarizing experimental results to discover natural laws was a great inspiration to the scientific community at the time. The famous experimentalist and materialist Joseph Priestley, who discovered gases such as carbon dioxide, ammonia, and hydrogen chloride, said that he had never thought of using experimental methods to discover new things until he met Franklin.
    Franklin's electrical experiments and theories are a milestone in the development of physics. In Europe, three hundred years before the Christian era, Theophrastus had discovered the phenomenon that rubbed amber attracts light objects, but for another two thousand years, electricity had not developed much. It was not until 1733 that the French scientist Du Fay discovered two different types of "electricity," "vitreous" and "resinous," and the law of like charges repel and unlike charges attract. In terms of experimentation, electrostatic generators had already been invented at this time, and the Leyden jar with capacitance was discovered shortly thereafter. This was the level of the science when Franklin began his electrical experiments. Franklin first saw an electrical demonstration in 1746 and soon obtained a set of electrical instruments (at this time he had not yet seen European electrical literature), and he immediately devoted all his energy to electrical experiments. In less than a few months, he had rediscovered many phenomena already known in Europe, made many new discoveries, and began to pursue theoretical explanations. He discovered the phenomena of point discharge and flame conduction. He was the first in history to propose the names positive and negative electricity, using plus and minus signs to represent them. This was a great step forward from the terms "vitreous electricity" and "resinous electricity," and enabled electricity to begin moving in an accurate and quantitative direction. Franklin's research on the Leyden jar enabled the scientific community to correctly understand its function and recognize the importance of insulators in electricity. In 1749, Franklin proposed the famous "single fluid theory," which was the first clear and consistent theory of electricity in history. He believed that there was only one kind of electricity, and that an object's positive or negative charge was due to too much or too little electricity. This statement is very similar to today's electron theory (except that the positive and negative are reversed), but it cannot be said that electron theory is derived from Franklin's theory. Franklin's famous kite experiment proved that lightning is an inter-cloud discharge phenomenon. A mysterious phenomenon that humans had believed to be controlled by supernatural forces since their ancient ancestors was thus given a materialistic explanation and could be imitated on a small scale in the laboratory. This was an extremely important contribution to mankind's understanding and control of nature, and its significance far exceeded the application of lightning rods. Franklin's experiment prompted the famous Russian scholar Academician Richmann to conduct further research on lightning phenomena. At this time, the great Russian scholar Lomonosov was also conducting research on atmospheric electricity. Richmann unfortunately died from a lightning strike during an experiment on July 23, 1753. Franklin's contributions to electricity are numerous, such as the invention of the electrostatic motor, and theories about thunderstorms, atmospheric charge, aurora borealis, and the Earth's magnetic field. It is impossible to count them all for a while.
    Not only in electricity, but also in other scientific fields, Franklin made many extremely important contributions. For example, Franklin was the first to conduct underwater sound transmission experiments. When he was experimenting in the river, he found that the sound of two stones forcefully colliding underwater could still be heard strongly a mile away, so he inferred that it could still be heard much further away. This was the earliest hydroacoustics experiment. The utilization of underwater sound transmission plays an extremely important role in ocean research and navigation.
    Like all scientists who love truth, Franklin loved peace and freedom. When he went to London as a representative of the colonies, he did everything he could to strive for a peaceful resolution to the North American colonial problem. Although he failed, he won the respect of the British government and public at that time. He and Jefferson jointly drafted the American Declaration of Independence. The famous saying "All men are created equal" still resonates after nearly two hundred years. At the age of 71, Franklin went to Paris as the American ambassador to France and signed a treaty of alliance with France. This treaty played a major role in the victory of the American Revolutionary War. He participated in the signing of the peace treaty with England, and American independence was finally recognized. With his great statesman's demeanor and passion for freedom, Franklin established immortal feats in the American Revolutionary War. Franklin constantly struggled for the welfare of the people throughout his life. He founded universities to educate young people and the "Philadelphia Philosophical Society" to study academics, which played a certain role in improving the cultural level of the United States. He opposed the massacre of innocent Indians and the system of black slavery, which were ahead of his time. Franklin's love of peace, freedom, democracy, and his eagerness to help others have become the fine traditions of the American people.
    Franklin was an outstanding American statesman and scholar. Today, reviewing his words and deeds makes us further understand his greatness. Today, we commemorate Franklin to redouble our efforts to develop our scientific cause, safeguard the peace cause of the people of the world, and strive to build a peaceful and happy socialist society.

    纪念富兰克林诞生250周年
    中国科学院应用物理研究所研究员　马大猷
    250年前（1706）的1月17日，本杰明·富兰克林诞生在美国波士顿。今天全世界进步的人民都在纪念这位杰出的美国政治家和物理学家。富兰克林是多方面发展的人，他在新闻事业中，在外交工作中，在科学研究中都表现了惊人的天才，同时，他又是游泳名手。他活了84岁，有68年不断地发表著作。他对一切问题都感到兴趣，除了物理学以外，他还研究过气象学、博物学、地质学、化学、力学、农学和数学问题。他的关于纸币的著作曾得到马克思的高度评价。他改进了壁炉和路灯的设计，发明了避雷针和双光眼镜，他创办了公共图书馆和消防队，他对航海、筑路、扫街、警察工作、房屋通风以及教育等问题都提过重要的意见。他追求真理的精神和他的简明有力的文字都给人极其深刻的印象。1766年休谟称富兰克林为新世界的第一个哲学家和第一个大学者。直到20世纪初，美国除林肯以外还没有一个人在国外的声誉可以和富兰克林相提并论的。
    富兰克林出身于贫苦家庭。父亲约西亚原来是染羊毛的，在1685年因躲避宗教迫害由英国移民到波士顿，改行作牛脂蜡烛。本杰明是最小的儿子（第十个），上过两年学，十岁起就在家帮助父亲“切烛芯，浇烛型，看铺子，听使唤等等”了，12岁到印刷所作学徒，一直到40岁都是作印刷出版工作。富兰克林成为历史上少见的多方面发展的人才主要是靠他多年一贯的刻苦自学和朋友的帮助。
    在自然科学方面，富兰克林的贡献不仅在大量有历史意义的研究工作上，尤其重要的是他对实验物理学起了先驱者的作用。他的作大量实验、并且归纳实验结果以发现自然规律的研究方法，对当时的科学界是一个很大的启发。发现二氧化碳、阿莫尼亚、氯化氢等气体的著名实验家和唯物主义者约瑟夫·普立斯特里说，他在遇到富兰克林以前从来没有想到可以用实验方法来发现新事物。
    富兰克林的电学实验和学说是物理学发展的里程碑。在欧洲，纪元前三百年的时候，德奥夫拉司图士已发现摩擦过的琥珀吸引轻物的现象，但是又过了两千年电学还是没有多大发展。直到1733年，法国科学家都费才发现“玻璃的”和“琥珀的”两种不同的“电气”，以及同性相拒、异性相吸的规律。在实验方面，这时已经有了摩擦静电发生器，稍后又发现了有容电本领的莱顿瓶。这就是富兰克林在开始电学实验的时候，这门科学的水平。富兰克林在1746年第一次看到电学表演，不久又得到了一套电学仪器（这时他还没有见到过欧洲的电学文献），他就立刻把全副精力投入了电学试验。不到几个月他已经重新发现很多欧洲已经知道的现象，也有了不少新的发现，并且开始追求理论解释。他发现了尖端放电和火焰导电的现象。他在历史上第一次提出正电和负电的名称，用加号和减号代表它们，这比“玻璃电气”和“琥珀电气”的叫法大大地前进了一步，使电学开始走向准确的和定量的方向。富兰克林对莱顿瓶的研究使科学界正确地了解了它的作用，并且认识了绝缘体在电学中的重要性。在1749年，富兰克林提出著名的“单流质说”，这是历史上第一个明确的、前后一致的电学学说。他相信只有一种电，物体的正负是由于电太多或电太少的缘故。这个说法和今天的电子论很相似（只是正负颠倒了），但是不能说电子论是脱胎于富兰克林学说的。富兰克林著名的风筝试验证明了雷电就是云间放电现象，从人类远祖就认为受超自然力主宰的神秘现象就这样得到了唯物主义的解释，并且可以在实验室内作小规模的模仿了。这对人类认识自然和控制自然是极其重大的贡献，它的意义远远超过避雷针的应用。富兰克林的试验引起俄国著名学者里赫曼院士对雷电现象作进一步研究。这时俄国伟大学者洛蒙诺索夫也进行大气电学的研究，里赫曼并不幸于1753年7月23日在实验中受雷击牺牲。富兰克林在电学方面的贡献是非常多的，例如静电马达的发明，以及关于雷雨、大气电荷、北极光、地磁场的学说等等，一时是数不完的。
    不仅是在电学上，在其他科学方面，富兰克林也有很多极其重要的贡献。举例来说，富兰克林是第一个作水下传声试验的。他在河里试验的时候发现把两块石头在水下用力相碰的声音，在一哩外的水下听起来还是很强，因此推论说再远得多还是可以听得到的。这是最早的水声学实验。水下传声的利用，在海洋研究，在航海术中都起着极其重要的作用。
    像所有酷爱真理的科学家一样，富兰克林是爱好和平，爱好自由的。他到伦敦作殖民地的代表的时候，尽了一切力量争取北美洲殖民地问题的和平解决。他虽然失败了，但是却赢得了当时英国朝野的尊重。他和杰斐逊共同起草了美国独立宣言，“一切人生来都是平等的”这句名言经过近两百年的时间仍是响亮如初。富兰克林在71岁高龄到巴黎作美国驻法大使，和法国订了同盟条约，这一条约对美国独立战争的胜利是有重大作用的。他参加了对英和约的签定，美国独立终于获得了承认。富兰克林以其伟大的政治家的风度和爱好自由的热情，在美国独立战争中建立了不朽的功勋。富兰克林在一生中不断为人民福利事业奋斗，他创办了教育青年的大学，创办了研究学术的“费城哲学学会”，对提高美国文化水平起了一定作用。他反对屠杀无辜的印地安人，反对黑奴制度，这都是超过他的时代的。富兰克林的爱好和平、自由、民主和他的急公好义的精神已成了美国人民的优良传统。
    富兰克林是美国杰出的政治家和学者，今天回顾他的言行，使我们更进一步认识他的伟大。我们今天纪念富兰克林，要加倍努力地发展我们的科学事业，保卫世界人民的和平事业，为建设和平幸福的社会主义社会而奋斗。（附图片）
