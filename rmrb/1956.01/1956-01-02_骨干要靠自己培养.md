　　Cadres Must Be Cultivated Internally
    Last spring, the Model Township Party Branch in Qianshan County, Anhui Province, began to pay attention to politically and ideologically examining active members and cultivating them in conjunction with Party building. In addition to regularly assisting active members in their daily work, the branch also held Party classes twice a month, using specific examples from the township to explain the standards for Party members and the Party Constitution. For example, when discussing the second standard for Party members, they criticized the erroneous behavior of a cooperative chairman in the township who led members to collectively conceal production output. When discussing the seventh standard, they criticized the coercive and commanding work style of the chairman and group leaders. Each class was followed by discussion and self-examination, gradually raising the ideological awareness of these active members and enabling them to understand leadership methods. When new cooperatives were established on a large scale last autumn, five of the six new Party members developed from these people were elected as chairmen, and one was elected as a committee member. More than 30 active poor peasants were elected as chairmen, vice-chairmen, and committee members, ensuring Party leadership and the consolidation of the cooperatives.
    The practice of the Model Township Party Branch proves that as long as rural Party organizations strengthen the regular education of active members, the problem of cadres for running the cooperatives can be solved, and the problem of targets for Party building can also be solved.

　　骨干要靠自己培养
    安徽省潜山县模范乡党支部，去年春天，就注意对积极分子在政治上、思想上进行审查，并且结合建党加以培养。支部除了在日常工作中经常帮助积极分子以外；每月还上两次党课，用本乡具体例子讲解党员标准和党章。如讲党员标准第二条，就联系批判了本乡一个农业合作社社长带领社员集体隐瞒产量的错误行为；讲第七条，又批判了社长和组长中的强迫命令的作风。每讲一课，都进行讨论和检查，使这些积极分子逐步提高了思想觉悟，懂得了领导方法。到去年秋天大批建立新社的时候，在这些人里面新发展的六个党员，就有五个当选了社长，一个当选了社务委员；30多个贫农积极分子当选了社长、副社长和社务委员等，保证了党的领导和社的巩固。
    模范乡党支部的作法证明，农村党组织只要加强对积极分子的经常教育，不但办社的骨干问题可以解决，建党的对象问题也可以解决。
