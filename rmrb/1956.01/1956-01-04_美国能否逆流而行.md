Can the United States Swim Against the Tide?
    Feng Bin fu

Since the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, Western countries, particularly the United States, have increasingly clamored to "bury the Geneva spirit" and resume the "Cold War." The most typical representative of this trend is U.S. Secretary of State Dulles. He delivers speeches in Chicago one moment and runs to Paris to boost the morale of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the next. He is rehashing the old tunes of "retaliation" and "deterrence," slandering the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, and openly calling for a "new Cold War."

Dulles said that 1955 was a year of "tremendous change" that raised "many perplexing questions." Tremendous change is true. But the direction of the changes is quite clear and not "perplexing" at all. Even a blind man could feel the characteristics of the development of the international situation in 1955, namely: the strength of the Soviet Union, China, and the entire socialist camp has become stronger; their policy of loyalty to peace has been welcomed by more and more countries; the world peace movement continues to develop vigorously; the anti-colonialist struggle has reached an unprecedented height; the idea of peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems has taken root in the hearts of the people and continues to achieve success; and the United States' "policy of strength" is increasingly trapped in a serious and irreparable crisis. The realities of international life and the balance of power powerfully prove that the continued trend towards relaxation in the international situation is the mainstream of current international relations.

Can the United States swim against the tide? Just look at the objective facts of the development of the international situation in 1955, and the answer can be given.

First, it is beneficial to review the positive results achieved by the Geneva Four-Power Summit. The very convening of the Geneva Four-Power Summit was a sign of the failure of those who pursued the "policy of strength," who had been trying to obstruct great-power consultations since the end of the war. The "Geneva spirit" produced by the Four-Power Summit is the crystallization of the peaceful aspirations of the vast number of people in all countries of the world, and a reflection of the international balance of power. The French newspaper "Liberation" once said: "The Geneva spirit has taken root deeply in life, so that it cannot be eradicated."

Second, the achievements of the Asian-African 29-nation Bandung Conference, which are of great significance in another respect, must be pointed out. The Bandung Conference marked the awakening, progress, and unity of the Asian and African peoples. This achievement of the Bandung Conference is undoubtedly a powerful blow to the colonialists who have always tried to ride on the heads of the Asian and African people. The United States' conspiracy to undermine the Bandung Conference failed shamefully. Over the past year, the United States, in collusion with Britain, has pieced together the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact Group to expand the Western military alliance system, and this activity has been met with increasingly strong opposition from Asian and African countries. The Southeast Asia Group and the Baghdad Treaty have become disgraceful synonyms of being hated in Asian and African countries. The pressure exerted by the United States and Britain to force Jordan to join the Baghdad Treaty was not only ineffective, but also aroused the upsurge of the anti-imperialist struggle of Arab countries led by Egypt.

The actions of Asian and African countries in the tenth United Nations General Assembly to unanimously oppose colonialism tore off the mask of the United States and exposed its true face as a colonialist. The Syrian representative's pointed remarks in the UN General Assembly Political Committee, which cut through the imperialist deceptions, vividly expressed the emotions of the people in the Arab countries today. He said: "The Soviet Union does not have a military base in the Middle East, and the Soviet Union has not offended a citizen in the Middle East... It is not the Soviet Union that is suppressing the liberation movement in North. It is not the Soviet Union that created the great tragedy of the Palestinian issue. It is not the Soviet Union that bombarded the southern territory of Yemen. It is not the Soviet Union that attacked the territory of Buraimi in Saudi Arabia. All of this is the record of Western countries in the Middle East in the past 150 years." This shows that the era in which American and British imperialists could wantonly interfere in the countries of the Near and Middle East is gone forever.

Third, under the influence of the "Bandung Spirit" and the "Geneva Spirit," peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between countries with different systems in an atmosphere of mutual trust are constantly being strengthened and developed. Despite the interference and obstruction of the United States, more and more countries are increasingly strengthening the activities of friendly relations between countries that implement policies of promoting peace and opposing war. Not long ago, the visit of Soviet state leaders to India, Burma, and Afghanistan was a climax of this series of friendly activities. Undoubtedly, this is also the issue that Dulles, who never forgets the "policy of strength," regards as "perplexing." But what can be done about it? The conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty, the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the signing of the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance are all indelible facts. Not only that, but as a result of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany and the results of Soviet-Canadian and Soviet-Norwegian negotiations, even the relations between the Federal Republic of Germany, Canada, and Norway, as members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the Soviet Union have improved. This shows that in these countries, people generally demand to get rid of the influence of the United States and pursue an independent and autonomous policy.

Fourth, the failure of the U.S. "policy of strength" is also manifested in the increasing isolation of the United States and the deepening contradictions between the United States and its allies. One of the most striking features of the recently concluded Tenth United Nations General Assembly was the unprecedented isolation of the United States. A reporter for the American magazine "New Republic" sighed when summarizing this United Nations General Assembly: "The United Nations General Assembly is no longer under control." The reporter also pointed out that the United States was isolated not only on the issue of admitting new member states, but also on many other issues. He wrote: "On the issue of economic aid, it (referring to the United States, the same below) cannot provide anything. On the issue of colonies, it stands with the colonial group. … In the unprecedented dispute over the seat on the Security Council, its stubborn support for the Philippines did not receive much support in Asia and lost support in Europe." But the reporter also said one less thing, that is, on many issues, many Latin American countries no longer vote the same way as the United States.

Finally, as American commentator Lippmann said, the United States "cannot but face the fact of the bankruptcy of...the nuclear weapons monopoly." Yes, "being unable to avoid facing the bankruptcy of the American nuclear weapons monopoly" does indeed have a major impact on easing the international situation. Not long ago, while continuing to declare its efforts to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons, the Soviet Union conducted a hydrogen bomb explosion that was the most violent to date. This incident once again made those practitioners of the "policy of strength" who have always used atomic and hydrogen weapons for blackmail stare blankly, and they can no longer wield atomic weapons to threaten the world with their teeth and claws.

They have reached the end of a dead end. But they are still unwilling to give up their notorious "policy of strength." This shows that they do not like international cooperation, and they do not like the "Geneva spirit." They regard every achievement in peaceful coexistence and international friendly cooperation as a threat to their profits and colonial greed, and therefore feel prickles on their backs and cannot hide their deep-seated hatred.

However, history is ruthless, and no one can reverse the wheels of the historical process. Due to the common aspirations of peace-loving people all over the world, and due to the increasing strength of the world's peace forces led by the Soviet Union, the continued trend towards relaxation in the international situation cannot but be the mainstream of current international relations. If a small number of "policy of strength" adherents in the United States insist on swimming against the tide, they will only suffer greater and more tragic consequences.

　　美国能否逆流而行
    冯宾符
    四国外长会议以来，西方国家特别是美国越来越频繁地传出“埋葬日内瓦精神”，恢复“冷战”的喧嚷。这方面最典型的代表人物是美国国务卿杜勒斯。他一忽儿在芝加哥演说，一忽儿又跑到巴黎去给北大西洋集团打气。他重弹“报复”和“威慑”的老调，诬蔑苏联和平外交政策，并且公然要求进行“新的冷战”。
    杜勒斯说1955年是“千变万化”的一年，说它提出了“许多令人困惑的问题”。千变万化是真的。但变化所趋的方向十分明确，一些也不“令人困惑”。即使是瞎子也能够摸得出1955年国际形势发展的特点，那就是：苏联、中国和整个社会主义阵营国家的力量更加强大，它们忠于和平的政策受到越来越多国家的欢迎；世界和平运动继续蓬勃地发展；反殖民主义斗争空前高涨；不同制度国家和平共处的思想深入人心，并不断获得成就；美国“实力政策”日益陷于严重的不可挽救的危机。国际的现实生活和力量对比，有力地证明了国际局势继续趋向缓和是目前国际关系中的主流。
    美国能否逆流而行？只要看一看1955年国际形势发展的客观事实，就能作出回答。
    第一，回顾一下日内瓦四国首脑会议所取得的积极成果，是有益的。日内瓦四国首脑会议的召开的本身，就是战后以来竭力阻挠大国协商的“实力政策”奉行者的失败的标志。四国首脑会议所产生的“日内瓦精神”是世界各国广大人民和平愿望的结晶，是国际力量对比的一种体现。法国“解放报”曾说：“日内瓦精神已经在生活中深深地扎了根，以致不能把它铲除掉。”
    第二，必须指出在另一方面具有重大意义的亚非29国万隆会议的成就。万隆会议标志着亚非人民的觉醒、进步和团结。万隆会议的这种成就，对于一贯妄图骑在亚非人民头上的殖民主义者无疑是有力的打击。美国破坏万隆会议的阴谋可耻地失败了。一年来，美国伙同英国拼凑东南亚集团和巴格达条约集团来扩大西方军事联盟体系的活动，遭到亚非国家越来越强烈的反对。东南亚集团和巴格达条约，在亚非国家中已成了不光彩的被憎厌的同义词。美英迫使约旦参加巴格达条约的压力不但无效，反而引起了以埃及为首的阿拉伯国家反帝斗争的高涨。
    亚非国家在第十届联合国大会中一致反对殖民主义的行动，撕破了美国的伪装，暴露了它的殖民主义者的真面目。叙利亚代表在联大政委会中一针见血地揭破帝国主义欺骗的发言，生动地表达了今天阿拉伯国家人心向背的情绪，他说：“苏联在中东没有一个军事基地，苏联在中东没有触犯过一个公民……镇压北非解放运动的不是苏联。制造巴勒斯坦问题这个大悲剧的不是苏联。轰击也门南部领土的不是苏联。袭击沙特阿拉伯的领土布赖米的不是苏联。这一切都是过去150年中西方国家在中东的记录。”这说明了，美英帝国主义者可以为所欲为地干涉中近东国家的时代已经一去不返了。
    第三，在“万隆精神”和“日内瓦精神”的影响下，不同制度国家在相互信任的气氛中的和平共处和友好合作，正在不断地加强和发展。尽管有着美国的干涉和阻挠，越来越多的国家却日益加强着执行促进和平、反对战争的政策的国家之间友好关系的活动。不久之前，苏联国家领导人员访问印度、缅甸、阿富汗之行，正是这一系列友好活动的一个高潮。无疑地，这也就是念念不忘“实力政策”的杜勒斯所引为“令人困惑”的问题。但这又有什么办法呢？奥地利国家条约的缔结，苏联和南斯拉夫关系的改善，苏芬友好互助合作条约的签订，都是不可磨灭的事实。不但如此，由于苏联和西德的建交以及苏加、苏挪谈判的结果，连作为北大西洋集团成员的德意志联邦共和国、加拿大和挪威同苏联的关系也有了改善。这说明了在这些国家中，人们普遍地要求摆脱美国的影响，奉行独立自主的政策。
    第四，美国“实力政策”的失败，还表现于美国的日形孤立和美国同它盟国之间矛盾的愈益加深。不久以前闭幕的第十届联合国大会的最鲜明的特点之一，就是美国的空前孤立。美国“新共和”杂志一位记者在总结这次联合国大会时叹息道：“联合国大会不再受控制了。”这位记者还指出，不仅在接纳新会员国问题上，而且在其他许多问题上美国的处境都是孤立的，他写道：“在经济援助问题上，它（指美国，以下同）提供不出什么东西。在殖民地问题上，它同殖民集团站在一边。……在安全理事会席位问题上的前所未有的争执中，它固执地支持菲律宾，这在亚洲没有得到什么支持，而在欧洲是失去了支持。”但这位记者还少说了一句话，就是：在许多问题上，很多拉丁美洲国家也不再和美国投同样的票了。
    最后，诚如美国评论家李普曼所说的，美国“不能不面对……核子武器垄断的破产”的事实。是的，“不能不面对美国核子武器垄断的破产”的事实，对于缓和国际局势的确有重大的作用。不久以前苏联在继续宣布为禁止原子武器和氢武器而努力的同时，进行了一次直到现在为止最猛烈的氢弹爆炸。这件事使那些一向凭借原子和氢武器进行讹诈的“实力政策”奉行者们又一次直瞪着眼，再也不能张牙舞爪地挥弄原子武器来威吓世界了。
    他们已经走到了死胡同的尽头。可是他们仍不甘心放弃声名狼借的“实力政策”。这说明了他们不喜欢国际合作，不喜欢“日内瓦精神”。他们对于和平共处和国际友好合作的每一步成就，都看作是对自己利润和殖民贪欲的威胁，因而感到芒之在背，掩盖不住他们刻骨的憎恨。
    然而历史是无情的，谁也不能扭转历史进程的车轮。由于全世界人民爱好和平的共同愿望，由于以苏联为首的世界和平力量的日益强大，国际局势的继续趋向缓和毕竟不能不是目前国际关系中的主流。美国少数的“实力政策”奉行者如果一定要逆流而行，那只有遭受更大、更悲惨的后果。
