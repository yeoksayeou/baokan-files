    In Mouding County, Yunnan Province, the 160-plus agricultural cooperatives established in the autumn of 1955 now all have relatively suitable accountants and have established a relatively sound set of accounts.
    In the past, the business skills of many old cooperative accountants in Mouding County were very low, and the cooperative's accounts were very chaotic. Therefore, the Mouding County Party Committee decided that, in addition to setting up accounting training classes, it would also draw a group of accountants from county-level banks, trading companies, and other departments to form three accounting work guidance groups, responsible for training accountants for the newly established cooperatives and strengthening the guidance of old cooperative accountants. At the same time, each district also drew some accounting personnel from bank business offices and supply and marketing cooperatives to form accounting guidance stations. Each guidance group (station), in coordination with the Communist Youth League organizations and cultural and educational departments, helped youth self-study groups to initially learn accounting business and selected qualified youth to attend accounting training classes. Many new cooperatives also selected enough scorekeepers and custodians from youth self-study groups.

    帮助新社培养会计员
    云南省牟定县1955年秋季建立的160多个农业合作社，现在都有了比较合适的会计员，并且建立了一套比较健全的账目。
    从前，牟定县不少老社会计员的业务水平很低；社的账目很混乱。因此，牟定县委决定除设立会计训练班外，并且从县级银行、贸易公司等部门抽调一批会计员，组成三个会计工作辅导组，负责给新建社培养、训练会计员，并且加强对老社会计的辅导工作。同时，各区也抽出银行营业所和供销合作社的部分会计人员组成会计辅导站。各辅导组（站）同青年团组织和文教部门配合，帮助青年自学小组初步学习会计业务，并且挑选有条件的青年到会计训练班受训。许多新社还从青年自学小组里选择了足够的记分员和保管员。
