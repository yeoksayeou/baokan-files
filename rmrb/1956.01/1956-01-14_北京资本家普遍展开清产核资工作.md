Xinhua News Agency, January 12th - After all capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing implemented joint state-private ownership, all sectors immediately and universally launched inventory and asset verification work. Yuan Fangyu, manager of Guangming Rubber Factory, did not rest for two consecutive days and nights in order to complete the inventory and valuation as quickly as possible. Capitalists from traditional Chinese medicine shops such as Heming Hall, Xiqingrentang, and Huixiantang in Qianmen District, with the assistance of employees, began inventory on the evening of the 9th and did not finish until late at night. The 17 rubber industry capitalists who completed the inventory and valuation conducted a review at the Rubber Industry Trade Association. During the review, they all paid attention to the principles of fairness, reasonableness, and seeking truth from facts.

In order to make the inventory and asset verification work fast and efficient, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, through various meetings, explained to the capitalists that the capitalists should be primarily responsible for this inventory and asset verification, and they could fill in, estimate, verify, and report by themselves. Employees should assist and supervise capitalists in taking stock. Many enlightened capitalists believed that this was the government's trust in them and a good opportunity for them to earn merit, so they consciously engaged in this work.

The vast number of employees in various industries, while continuing to produce and operate during the day, used evenings and other rest times to assist capitalists in taking stock of assets. Many factory and store employees stayed up all night to help capitalists complete the inventory of thousands of complex machines, tools, and other assets.

    北京资本家普遍展开清产核资工作
    据新华社12日讯  北京市资本主义工商业全部实行公私合营后，各个行业立即普遍展开了清产核资工作。光明橡胶厂经理袁芳宇为尽快完成清点、估价，连续两昼夜没有休息。前门区鹤鸣堂、西庆仁堂和会贤堂等国药店资本家在职工协助下，9日晚开始清点，直到深夜才结束。完成了清点、估价的17户橡胶业资本家，在橡胶业同业公会又进行了评议。评议中他们都注意了公平合理、实事求是的原则。
    为使清产核资作得又快又好，北京市人民委员会曾通过各种会议，向资本家说明了在这次清产核资中，资本家要负主要责任，可以由资本家自填、自估、自核、自报。职工们应该协助和监督资本家进行盘点。许多有觉悟的资本家认为这是政府对自己的信任，也是自己争取立功的好机会，因之，都自觉地投入这一工作。
    各行业的广大职工，白天照常生产和营业，利用晚间和其他休息时间，协助资本家盘点资产，有许多工厂和商店的职工都是彻夜不眠，帮助资本家完成几千种复杂的机器、工具等资产的清点。
