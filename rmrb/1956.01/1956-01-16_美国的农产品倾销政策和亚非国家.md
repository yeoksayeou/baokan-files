The U.S. Agricultural Dumping Policies and Asian-African Countries
Wang Zhuang
President Eisenhower proposed a plan on January 9 to continue dumping agricultural products abroad. This plan has caused deep unease among Asian-African countries, as well as agricultural product exporting countries such as Canada and Australia.

As everyone knows, the United States dumps agricultural products in an attempt to transfer its agricultural crisis to other countries. The United States has suffered a severe agricultural crisis for several years. In 1953, the year of the Korean War armistice, the total value of "surplus" agricultural products owned by the U.S. government was $3 billion. By the end of 1955, this number had increased to $8 billion. Under these circumstances, the prices of agricultural products are falling day by day, and the income of American farmers is also declining. In 1953, the income of American farmers was $12.3 billion. By 1955, it had fallen to $10.7 billion, a decrease of 12%. These figures vividly demonstrate the further deepening of the U.S. agricultural crisis. American farmers are nearing the brink of bankruptcy.

The United States dumps agricultural products abroad, on the one hand, to export the agricultural crisis to other countries. On the other hand, it attempts to make surplus agricultural products serve its military strategic purposes. In recent years, the United States has exported a large number of "surplus" agricultural products in the name of "economic aid" and "military aid." U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Benson said in October 1954: "I think food is a powerful weapon. I don't think we have fully used it and brought its role into play. I hope to see more food shipped abroad." U.S. Senator Jackson also clamored to step up the use of surplus agricultural products to "assist" U.S. foreign policy. Currently, the United States is using "surplus" agricultural products to exchange for tungsten and manganese from South Korea, manganese ore and chromite from Turkey, and exchanged Japanese war equipment, and enabled Japan to use the funds from the sale of U.S. "surplus" agricultural products to re-equip factories to manufacture guns, bullets, and repair U.S. jet aircraft. These are just a few major examples.

Today, there is another non-negligible reason for the United States to dump agricultural products in large quantities: the Republican government attempts to use this to deceive voters in American agricultural areas, because the U.S. will hold general elections in November this year.

In order to achieve the above objectives, the United States has adopted a variety of dumping methods.

The "Mutual Security Act" passed by the U.S. Congress in 1953 stipulates that the President has the right to export "surplus" agricultural products at reduced prices in exchange for the currency of the importing country, and use the proceeds as military loans to the importing country to purchase military materials, maintain or build U.S. military bases. By the end of June 1955, the total value of this transaction had reached $400 million. It is stipulated in the fiscal year starting from July 1, 1955, that $300 million worth of agricultural products will be exported.

The "Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act" passed in 1954 also stipulates: ① The U.S. government will export $700 million worth of "surplus" agricultural products at reduced prices within 3 years (1954-1957). By 1955, the U.S. Congress increased this number to $1.5 billion. ② The U.S. government can directly "donate" "surplus" agricultural products to other countries. By the end of June 1955, agricultural products worth approximately $332 million had been used for this purpose. ③ Exchange strategic raw materials with other countries for "surplus" agricultural products. By the end of June 1955, $28.1 million had been exported under this item.

Of course, these are just the methods expressly stipulated in several bills. In fact, the United States has used all kinds of methods to dump agricultural products abroad. For example, the United States uses the so-called "package method" to force importing countries to purchase unwanted "surplus" agricultural products. In September 1955, when the United States negotiated a "surplus" agricultural product agreement with Japan, it forced Japan to accept tobacco that Japan did not need and wheat that Japan "needed" in one agreement; Japan originally only wanted to accept a maximum of 50,000 bales of American cotton, but the U.S. government forced Japan to accept 100,000 bales in a package plan.

Because the U.S. government has adopted this kind of arrogant and unreasonable dumping method, it has undermined the traditional foreign trade ties of agricultural product exporting countries and seized their foreign markets. This is a serious blow to the national economies of agricultural product exporting countries such as Myanmar, Thailand, Egypt, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Peru.

Myanmar and Thailand are both agricultural countries. Many industrial products rely on imports. Imports are paid for by export earnings. Rice accounts for more than 70% of the exports of these two countries. However, under the influence of U.S. agricultural product dumping, the rice exports of these two countries have been severely squeezed, and export earnings have been greatly reduced. From January to August 1954, U.S. rice exports increased by 10% compared with the same period in 1953, and increased by 8 times compared with the pre-World War II export level. Thailand's rice exports in 1954 decreased by 22% compared with 1953, and Myanmar's rice exports were more than 50% lower than before World War II. This has made the national economies of these countries encounter difficulties. Myanmar's "Yangon Daily" once said that as a result of the United States selling "surplus" agricultural products to Myanmar's traditional markets at dumping prices, Myanmar's balance of payments deteriorated in 1954, and its foreign exchange reserves decreased by nearly 40%. According to news revealed to the press by Luang Chaiyong, the former Minister of the Interior of Thailand in May 1955, Thailand's foreign trade deficit in 1954 increased by 17.19% compared with 1953. According to a recent issue of Thailand's "Economic" semi-monthly magazine, from January to September 1955, the foreign trade deficit increased by about 70% compared with the full-year deficit in 1954, and Thailand's economic situation continued to deteriorate.

Cotton accounts for 90% of Egypt's export trade. Cotton also accounts for a considerable proportion of the export trade of other countries such as Sudan, Turkey, Pakistan, Peru, Brazil, and Mexico. However, as a result of the U.S. government forcibly dumping U.S. cotton, the cotton exports of these countries have encountered great difficulties. According to U.S. press materials, in the last few months of 1954, U.S. cotton exports increased by 40% compared with the same period of the previous year, while Egypt's cotton exports decreased by 29%, Pakistan by 68%, Sudan by 70%, and Turkey by 80%. The Egyptian Minister of Finance said in November 1955: "The situation is very disturbing. The cotton world is in a state of flux."

Because the U.S. government has been doing its best to seize the foreign markets of wheat exporting countries such as Canada and Australia, the national economies of these countries have also suffered great damage. U.S. wheat exports increased by 40% in 1954-1955 compared with 1953-1954, while Canada's wheat exports during the same period only maintained the level of the previous year. In the case of fierce competition between the United States and Canada in wheat exports, Canada's wheat inventories increased and farmers' incomes decreased in 1954. U.S. wheat dumping poses a serious threat to Canadian agriculture. Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce Howe said in May 1955 that the United States "is beginning to encroach on Canada's wheat export market." The chairman of the National Farmers Association of Australia also accused the United States of handling "surplus" agricultural products as "viciously undermining the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade." The dumping of U.S. wheat to South America has also caused unease among South American wheat exporting countries. Uruguayan President Berres, the main wheat exporting country in South America, accused the U.S. dumping of being a "policy of creating hunger for (wheat) producing countries."

The U.S. massive dumping of butter and other dairy products has also harmed the interests of dairy product exporting countries and caused them unease. Dairy product exports account for one-third of New Zealand's national income. Australia, the Netherlands, and Denmark are also major dairy product exporting countries. New Zealand has protested to the United States four times in 1954 and 1955 regarding U.S. dairy product dumping.

U.S. agricultural product dumping has also brought serious harm to importing countries. It is enough to cite the example of Japan to illustrate everything. According to a "Reuters" Tokyo dispatch on the 10th, Japanese people originally ate rice, and now the production and needs of rice are still far from enough; but under the influence of U.S. agricultural product dumping, changes have also taken place in the dietary habits of Japanese people. Now Japanese people also eat wheat, and Japan has become the world's second largest wheat customer. This situation has forced the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to "seriously recommend reconsidering Japan's traditional policy of increasing agricultural production for the first time in history." For example, the Philippines is a famous producer of Luzon tobacco, but the United States forced it to purchase a large amount of American tobacco leaves in 1955. Pakistan itself has a large amount of cotton that cannot find a market. In the past 10 months ending in June 1955, the United States forced it to import more than $20 million worth of U.S. cotton. U.S. dumping has put heavy pressure on the agriculture of importing countries and deepened their agricultural crisis. The impact does not stop there. It is well known that "surplus" agricultural products are being used by the U.S. government as a means to further expand economically and interfere in the internal affairs of importing countries.

From the above situation, it can be seen that the harm of U.S. agricultural product dumping is particularly serious to Asian-African countries. Because most Asian-African countries are agricultural countries. Whether they are exporters of agricultural products or importers of U.S. "surplus" grain, U.S. dumping has brought disaster to them. Precisely because of this, Eisenhower's plan has caused deep unease in Asian-African countries (of course, including countries like Canada and Australia). However, people can also see another trend: countries that have been harmed by U.S. agricultural product dumping, especially Asian countries, are gradually turning their attention to the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries. They are increasingly aware that only by carrying out equal and mutually beneficial trade with various countries in the socialist camp can their national economies be developed. The governments of Myanmar and Egypt have signed trade agreements with China and the Soviet Union; the call for trade with China and the Soviet Union is also rising in countries such as Thailand, Japan, Canada, and Australia. Facts have proved that developing trade exchanges and economic cooperation between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is the correct way for the economic development and prosperity of all countries.

    美国的农产品倾销政策和亚非国家
    王庄
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在1月9日提出了继续向国外倾销农产品的计划。这个计划已经引起亚非国家以及加拿大、澳大利亚等农产品出口国家的深深不安。
    大家知道，美国倾销农产品，就是想把它的农业危机转嫁到其他国家的头上。美国遭受严重的农业危机，已经有好几年了。在朝鲜停战的1953年，美国政府拥有的“剩余”农产品的总值为30亿美元，到1955年底，这个数字增长到80亿美元。在这种情况下，农产品的价格日益下跌，美国农民的收入也不断下降。在1953年，美国农民收入为123亿美元，到1955年，已下降到107亿美元，即减少了12％。这些数字，生动地证明了美国农业危机的进一步深刻化，美国农民已走近破产的边缘。
    美国向国外倾销农产品，一方面是为了向别的国家输出农业危机，同时也企图使剩余农产品服务于它的军事战略目的。最近几年来，美国在“经济援助”和“军事援助”的名义下，输出了大量的“剩余”农产品。美国农业部长本逊1954年10月曾说：“我认为粮食是一种威力强大的武器。我不以为我们已经充分使用了它和发挥了它的作用。我希望看到将有更多的粮食运往国外。”美国参议员杰克逊也叫嚷着要加紧利用剩余农产品来“辅助”美国外交政策。现在，美国正用“剩余”农产品换取了南朝鲜的钨和锰，土耳其的锰矿砂和铬矿砂；交换了日本战争装备，并且使日本用出售美国“剩余”农产品所得的款项重新装备工厂以制造枪炮、子弹和修理美国喷气飞机。这只是几个主要的例子。
    在今天，美国大量倾销农产品还有一个不可忽视的原因，那就是：共和党政府企图以此来骗取美国农业区的选票，因为今年11月美国就要举行大选。
    为了达到上述目的，美国采取了各种各样的倾销手段。
    美国国会在1953年通过的“共同安全法案”规定，总统有权削价输出“剩余”农产品，换取进口国的货币，并把所得货币作为对进口国的军事贷款，在进口国购买军事物资，维持或建筑美国军事基地之用。到1955年6月底为止，此项交易总值已达4亿美元。在自1955年7月1日起的财政年度中规定，将履行输出3亿美元农产品。
    在1954年通过的“农业贸易发展和援助法案”中又规定：①美国政府在3年内（1954—1957年）削价输出7亿美元的“剩余”农产品。到1955年，美国国会又把这个数字增加到15亿美元。②美国政府可用“剩余”农产品直接“赠与”其他国家。到1955年6月底为止，约有价值33，200万美元的农产品作此用途。③以“剩余”农产品向其他国家交换战略原料。到1955年6月底止，在此项下已输出28，100万美元。
    当然，这只是几个法案中明文规定的办法。实际上，美国为了向国外倾销农产品，已无所不用其极，使用了种种办法。例如，美国运用所谓“一揽子办法”强迫进口国购进不需要的“剩余”农产品。1955年9月，美国在同日本谈判“剩余”农产品协定时，硬把日本所不需要的烟草和日本所“需要”的小麦列在一个协定之内，强迫日本接受；日本原来仅愿最多接受美棉5万包，但美国政府在一揽子计划中，却强迫日本接受10万包。
    由于美国政府采取了这种蛮横无理的倾销手段，破坏了农产品出口国家传统的对外贸易联系，夺取了它们的国外市场。这对像缅甸、泰国、埃及、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰、丹麦、荷兰、秘鲁等农产品出口国家的国民经济是一个严重打击。
    缅甸和泰国都是农业国家。许多工业品依靠进口。进口货是靠出口收入来偿付的。这两个国家的出口货中，大米占到70％以上。但在美国农产品倾销的影响下，这两个国家的大米出口遭到了严重的排挤，出口收入大为减少。1954年1至8月美国大米出口量比1953年同期增加了10％，比第二次大战前的输出水平增加了8倍。而泰国1954年大米出口比1953年减少22％，缅甸大米出口比第二次大战前低50％以上。这就使得这些国家的国民经济遭到了困难。缅甸“仰光日报”曾说，由于美国按倾销价格向缅甸的传统市场出售“剩余”农产品的结果，1954年缅甸的支付平衡恶化，它的外汇储存减少了将近40％。根据泰国前内政部部长銮差永在1955年5月向报界透露的消息，泰国1954年对外贸易入超比1953年增加了17.19％。据最近一期泰国“经济”半月刊报道，1955年1至9月，对外贸易入超比1954年全年入超还增加了70％左右，泰国的经济情况还在继续恶化。
    埃及出口贸易中棉花占90％。其他如苏丹、土耳其、巴基斯坦、秘鲁、巴西、墨西哥的出口贸易中，棉花也占着相当大的比重。但由于美国政府强行倾销美棉的结果，使这些国家的棉花出口遇到很大的困难。根据美国报刊材料，在1954年的最后几个月中，美棉出口量比前一年同期增加了40％，而埃及棉花出口量却减少29％，巴基斯坦减少68％，苏丹减少70％，土耳其减少80％。埃及财政部长1955年11月说：“情况是非常令人不安的，棉花世界正处于一种动摇不定的状态”。
    由于美国政府全力抢夺小麦出口国如加拿大和澳大利亚的国外市场，使得这些国家的国民经济也遭受了很大的损害。美国小麦输出1954—1955年度比1953—1954年度增加40％，而加拿大同期的小麦输出仅保持前一年的水平。在美国和加拿大输出小麦剧烈竞争情况下，1954年加拿大小麦存货增加，农民收入减少。美国的小麦倾销对加拿大的农业构成了严重的威胁。加拿大贸易与商业部长霍威在1955年5月说，美国“正在开始蚕食着加拿大的小麦输出市场”。澳大利亚全国农民协会主席也指责美国对“剩余”农产品的处理是“穷凶极恶地破坏着关税贸易总协定的精神”。美国小麦向南美倾销的结果也引起南美出口小麦国的不安。南美主要小麦输出国乌拉圭的总统柏莱斯指责说，美国的倾销是给“生产（小麦）国家制造饥饿的政策”。
    美国向国外大量倾销牛油和其他乳制品的结果，也损害了乳制品输出国家的利益，并引起它们的不安。新西兰乳制品出口占新西兰国民收入三分之一。澳大利亚、荷兰、丹麦也是输出乳制品主要国家。新西兰在1954年和1955年两年中曾4次就美国倾销乳制品向美国提出抗议。
    美国倾销农产品也给进口国家带来了严重的危害。这只要举日本的例子就足够说明一切的。据“路透社”10日东京电讯说，日本人本来吃的是大米，现在大米的产量和需要还差得很远；但在美国农产品倾销影响下，日本在饮食习惯方面也发生了变化，现在日本人兼吃小麦，并且，日本已成了世界上第二个最大的小麦顾客，这种情况已迫使日本农林省“有史以来第一次认真地建议重新考虑日本的增加农业生产的传统政策”。再如：菲律宾是有名的吕宋烟出产国家，美国却强使它在1955年购买大量美国烟叶。巴基斯坦本身有大量棉花找不到销路，美国在到1955年6月底为止的过去10个月中，强使它输入价值2，000多万美元的美棉。美国的倾销已使进口国家的农业受到沉重的压力，加深了它们的农业危机。影响还不止于此。人所共知，“剩余”农产品正被美国政府作为进一步进行经济扩张和干涉进口国家内政的手段。
    由上述情况可以看出，美国倾销农产品的危害，对亚非国家特别严重。因为亚非国家绝大部分是农业国家。不论它们是农产品的出口国，或者是美国“剩余”粮食的进口国，美国的倾销都对它们带来了灾祸。正因为这样，艾森豪威尔的计划已在亚非国家（当然也包括像加拿大、澳大利亚这些国家）引起了深深的不安。但是，人们也可以看到另一种倾向：受到美国倾销农产品之害的国家，特别是亚洲国家都逐渐把目光转向苏联、中国和各人民民主国家。它们愈来愈认识到，只有同社会主义阵营各国才能开展平等互利的贸易，从而才能使自己的国民经济得到发展。缅甸和埃及两国政府已经同中、苏订立了贸易协定；泰国、日本、加拿大、澳大利亚等国国内要求同中苏开展贸易的呼声也愈益高涨。事实证明，只有在平等互利的基础上发展各国之间的贸易交流和经济合作，才是一切国家经济发展和繁荣的正确途径。
