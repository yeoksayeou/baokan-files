Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 30th: TASS reported that Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin, Soviet Communist Party Central Committee First Secretary Khrushchev, and Soviet Council of Ministers First Deputy Chairman and Foreign Minister Molotov held talks with German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl and German Democratic Republic Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Bolz in the Kremlin on December 29th.

　　During the talks, opinions were exchanged on international issues of mutual interest. The talks showed that both sides agreed on the urgent need for further efforts by all countries to guarantee European collective security. The organization of an all-European collective security system with the participation of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany would resolve the German question in accordance with the interests of European peace.

　　Participants in the talks unanimously agreed that the only realistic way to resolve the issue of restoring German unity under the existing conditions, making it a peace-loving and democratic country, is for the two German states—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany—to reach corresponding agreements.

　　The talks were conducted in a sincere and friendly atmosphere.

　　新华社31日讯　塔斯社莫斯科30日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁、苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫和苏联部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长莫洛托夫曾在12月29日在克里姆林宫同德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥和德意志民主共和国副总理兼外交部长博尔茨举行了会谈。
    会谈时对双方所感兴趣的国际问题交换了意见。会谈表明：双方一致认为迫切需要各国在保障欧洲集体安全方面作进一步的努力。组织有德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国参加的全欧集体安全体系，根据欧洲和平的利益解决德国问题。
    参加会谈者一致认为，在现有条件下解决恢复德国统一使它成为爱好和平和民主国家的问题的唯一现实道路是，两个德意志国家——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国达成相应的协议。
