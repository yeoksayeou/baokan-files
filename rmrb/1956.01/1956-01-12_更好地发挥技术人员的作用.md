    Chairman Mao said in the "Decision on Absorbing Large Numbers of Intellectuals" written for the Central Committee of the Party on December 1, 1939: "Without the participation of intellectuals, the victory of the revolution is impossible." This sentence illustrates the evaluation of intellectuals by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. After liberation, we have also personally witnessed and experienced the great role of this policy. The Party and the government give every useful intellectual the opportunity to develop their talents and have promoted many intellectuals to leadership positions. After several adjustments, the vast majority of our factory's senior technical cadres now hold certain leadership positions. In the second half of 1952, the factory's party organization, under the leadership of the higher-level party committee, thoroughly examined the problems in implementing the Party's policy towards technical cadres and reversed some incorrect understandings. In the second half of 1953, a concrete analysis of the positions of the factory's senior technical cadres was made, and appropriate and reasonable arrangements were made. So far, the work of senior technical personnel is basically reasonable. The achievements of the Party organization in implementing the Party's policy towards intellectuals should be affirmed realistically. The fact that technical cadres and engineers are always selected as models during our annual model worker evaluations also illustrates this point.

    Over the past few years, thanks to the Party's education and seeing the great achievements of the new China with their own eyes, the political consciousness of the factory's technical cadres has gradually improved. They love the new China, support the Communist Party, and are determined to follow the Communist Party. I personally come from the old society, and like other technical cadres, my political consciousness is also constantly improving. Moreover, due to my job position, I have received more education and training from the Party. When I encounter difficulties in my work, the Party always enthusiastically helps me overcome them; when I make mistakes, they are promptly corrected. I am studying theory with the Party Secretary and several other veteran comrades, so my theoretical understanding is also improving relatively quickly. What has benefited me the most is the enlightenment I received on the issue of combining theory with practice. For example, when studying the documents of the first Five-Year Plan, they can well connect them with the situation of our factory and study the documents. But I am not sensitive enough in this regard, often only focusing on the numbers and facts in the documents, and not being able to study the documents well in connection with practical problems. I am also often invited to attend Party committee meetings, which has educated me a lot. Due to the Party's long-term education of me, coupled with the enlightenment and help of the Party's leading cadres, I feel that if technical cadres want to do their job well, they must rely closely on the Party.

    But it must also be admitted that some Party members do not understand the Party's policy towards intellectuals well enough and do not recognize the role of intellectuals in national construction. Some Party cadres who do leadership work do not trust technical personnel. For example, for one calculation, they ask two technical personnel to do it at the same time to see who is right. As a result, the latter goes to ask the former, which makes the former feel that the Party does not trust him, and his work enthusiasm immediately declines. After liberation, the Party's ranks have grown, and more newly promoted cadres have emerged. But some new Party cadres do not understand the Party's policy and treat senior technical personnel with the wrong attitude, hurting their feelings. The Party should educate these Party cadres so that they understand the role of intellectuals in national construction and the Party's policy, because they often work with technical personnel and have the most contact with technical cadres, and they are the direct implementers of the Party's policy towards intellectuals.

    The Party's cadres' help and education for technical personnel are not universal enough, so that some technical personnel do not feel enough of the Party's warmth. Technical personnel generally have technical theory and experience, but their organizational skills are weaker. The Party organization should understand the difficulties of technical cadres and help them solve their difficulties. This help should not be limited to a few technical personnel, but should extend to every technical personnel. Only in this way can we unite all technical personnel.

    The contact between Party cadres and technical personnel is generally limited to work-related aspects, and a truly deep relationship has not been universally established. They rarely talk heart-to-heart frankly. Because they don't talk to each other, if they have opinions, they keep them to themselves, and they accumulate more and more, which can lead to prejudice. Therefore, Party cadres and technical personnel should not only interact at work, but also live together. On Sundays and holidays, they can play together, talk and laugh, talk about each other's lives, and talk about their hobbies. In this way, gradually a deep relationship will develop, and they will be able to talk about everything. If there are problems on both sides, they can be quickly understood and resolved. This will be very beneficial to the work.

    The lack of cultivation of technical personnel, using them more and educating them less, is also a complaint of many technical workers. Sometimes, emphasizing the needs of work, a person is transferred back and forth, which affects his in-depth study of his profession. One of our factory's technical workers has been transferred five times since liberation, and three of these transfers were difficult to combine with his studies, so he did not make greater achievements in his professional work. In addition, the leadership has not paid attention to providing technical cadres with a better learning environment. The place at home is small, and the children are noisy, so in order to study, they have to run a long way to the office. But the office is also small, crowded, and very messy. Some technical personnel report that it is difficult to think quietly in the office during the day or concentrate on solving major problems, and they are always dealing with the "retail" that comes and goes. As a result, many problems have to be dealt with at night. This makes their study time even less. Therefore, we must think of ways to overcome the busy and chaotic phenomenon in the factory and establish a normal working order so that technical personnel not only have relatively ample time to solve problems in daily production, but also have relatively ample time and a relatively quiet environment to think about major problems in order to improve production and technical level. But to achieve this, administratively, we cannot emphasize uniform treatment. On issues such as housing, we should take into account the special difficulties of technical personnel in self-study in their spare time.

    The historical problems of some technical workers are relatively complicated, especially senior intellectuals. This is also caused by the objective environment of the old society. Some technical personnel feel that this is a great spiritual burden, so their work enthusiasm fluctuates. One comrade said: "I have a small problem in my history, which I have never told since liberation. Now that my consciousness has improved, I feel sorry for the Party when I think of my problem, but I don't have the courage to explain it to the organization. So I get emotional whenever there is a movement." The current anti-rightist movement is underway, and the Party has given every staff member a good opportunity to clear up historical problems. Everyone who has a relatively complicated political relationship in history and has not made an explanation can use this opportunity to make an appropriate explanation and unload the burden for themselves. At the same time, the Party organization should also sincerely enlighten them, dispel their concerns, and explain to them that the problems in history are only problems in history, and after the explanation is clear, they can still be trusted by the Party and the people, so that they can drop their burdens and work easily and happily.

    更好地发挥技术人员的作用
    石景山钢铁厂总工程师  安朝俊
    毛主席在1939年12月1日为党中央写的“大量吸收知识分子”的决定中说过：“没有知识分子的参加，革命的胜利是不可能的。”这句话说明了党中央和毛主席对知识分子的估价。在解放后，我们也亲眼看到并且体会了这个政策的伟大作用。党和政府给每个有用的知识分子以可能的机会来发挥自己的才能，提拔了很多的知识分子到领导岗位上。我们厂的高级技术干部，经过多次的调整，现在绝大多数都担负着一定的领导职务。1952年下半年，全厂的党组织，在上级党委的领导下，深刻地检查了执行党对待技术干部的政策中的问题，扭转了若干不正确的认识。1953年下半年，对全厂较高级的技术干部的职位作了具体分析，并且作了适当的合理的安排。到目前为止，高级技术人员的工作，基本上是合理的。党组织执行党对待知识分子的政策的成绩，应该实事求是地予以肯定。我们在每年评模的时候，总有技术干部、工程师被选为模范，也说明了这个问题。
    全厂的技术干部，几年来，由于党的教育，由于亲眼看到了新中国的伟大成就，政治觉悟逐渐提高，热爱新中国，拥护共产党，坚决跟着共产党走。我个人是从旧社会里来的，同其他的技术干部一样，政治觉悟也不断提高。而且，由于工作职位的关系，我受到党的教育和培养更多些。在工作中遇到困难的时候，党总是热情地帮助自己克服困难；有了错误也及时地加以纠正。我是同党委书记和其他几个老同志在一块进行理论学习的，因此理论认识也提高的比较快。使自己受益最大的是在理论结合实际这个问题上给我的启发。例如在学习第一个五年计划的文件的时候，他们能够很好地联系本厂的情况，研究文件。但我在这方面就不够敏感，往往只钻文件上的数字和事实，不能很好地结合实际问题去研究文件。党委会开会也经常邀我列席，使我受到不少教育。由于党对我的长期教育，再加上党的领导干部的启发和帮助，使我感到技术干部要想作好自己的工作，必须紧紧地依靠党。
    但也不可讳言，有些党员同志对于党对待知识分子的政策还理解得不够，对于知识分子在国家建设中的作用认识不够。有些作领导工作的党员干部不信任技术人员。比如，一个计算，却找两位技术人员同时作，看谁的对。结果后一位又去问前一位，使前一位感到党对他不信任，工作情绪马上低落下来。解放后，党的队伍壮大了，新提拔的干部多了。但是有些新的党员干部，不理解党的政策，用错误的态度对待高级技术人员，伤了他们的感情。党应当教育这些党员干部，使他们懂得知识分子在国家建设中的作用以及党的政策，因为他们经常地和技术人员在一块工作，同技术干部接触最多，他们是党对待知识分子的政策的直接执行者。
    党的干部对于技术人员的帮助和教育还不够普遍，因此使得一部分技术人员感到党的温暖不够。技术人员一般地有技术理论和经验，但是组织能力较弱。党组织应该了解技术干部的困难，帮助技术干部解决困难。这种帮助不能只限于少数技术人员，而要遍及于每一个技术人员。这样才能团结全体技术人员。
    党员干部同技术人员之间，一般地还多限于工作职务方面的接触，真正深厚的感情还没有普遍建立，很少在一块诚恳坦率地谈心。由于彼此间不交谈，有了意见，蹩在肚里不说出来，越积越多，会弄成成见。所以党员干部同技术人员不只要在工作中打交道，而且还应该生活在一起。星期天、假日，一块玩玩，说说笑笑，谈谈彼此的生活，讲讲各人的爱好。这样，逐渐有了深厚的感情，无话不说，双方有了问题，就可以很快地得到了解和解决。这对于工作会有很大好处的。
    对于技术人员培养不够，使用多，教育少，这也是很多技术工作同志有意见的。有时候强调工作需要，把一个人调来调去，影响了他对业务的深入钻研。我们厂有个技术工作同志，解放后调过五次工作，其中有三次调动同他的所学很难结合，结果他在本行业务上没有作出更大的成绩。此外，领导方面也没有注意给技术干部一个较好的学习环境。家里的地方小，加上小孩叫闹，为了学习，必须跑很远到办公室去。而办公室也是地方小，人多，很乱。有些技术人员反映，白天在办公室里很难安静地思考问题，或者集中力量解决重大问题，尽是应付来来往往的“门市”了。结果好多问题还得放在晚间处理。这样，就使得他们学习时间更少了。所以，必须要想些办法，克服工厂的忙乱现象，树立正常的工作秩序，使技术人员不但有比较充裕的时间解决日常生产中的问题，而且有比较充裕的时间和比较安静的环境思考重大问题，以便提高生产和技术水平。但是要做到这样，在行政上就不能强调一律待遇，在住房等等的问题上应该对技术人员在业余时间进行自修的特殊困难加以照顾。
    有些技术工作同志的历史问题是比较复杂的，特别是高级知识分子是这样。这也是旧社会的客观环境造成的。有些技术人员感觉这是一个很大的精神负担，因此工作情绪忽高忽低。有一位同志说：“自己历史上有个小问题，解放后一直没讲。现在觉悟提高了，一想起自己的问题，就觉得对不起党，但是又没有勇气向组织交代出来。所以一遇运动就情绪波动。”现在正在开展肃反运动，党给了每个工作人员以清理历史问题的良好机会，每个在历史上政治关系比较复杂而没有作过交代的人都可以利用这个机会作适当的交代，替自己卸下包袱。同时党的组织也要诚恳地启发他们，解除他们的顾虑，向他们说明历史上的问题只是历史上的问题，交代清楚以后照样可以得到党和人民的信任，使他们丢掉包袱，轻松愉快地工作。
