    Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Czechoslovakia
    Czechoslovakia Yang Xingrui
    Czechoslovakia embarked on the road of socialist construction in 1948. Over the years, while vigorously developing industry, it has also carried out a movement of agricultural collectivization in the countryside, following the example of the Soviet Union. Small and middle peasants voluntarily organized themselves according to the model charter of unified agricultural production cooperatives. This charter stipulates the rights and obligations of cooperative members, and also tells cooperative members how to better manage agriculture. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic support the development of the agricultural cooperation movement in various ways, and give the cooperatives various preferential treatments: assistance from machine tractor stations, preferential loans, fertilizers, seeds, feed, obligatory sales quotas set lower than those for individual farmers, and so on.
    Depending on the different methods adopted by cooperative members in managing the collective economy and distributing the income of collective labor, four types of unified agricultural production cooperatives have emerged in Czechoslovakia.
    The first type of cooperative is: members carry out collective sowing, but at the same time retain their respective land boundaries. Here, members carry out field work together, and collectively use cooperative and private machines and draught animals. However, members harvest crops separately, each harvesting their own plot. During settlement, each farmer must pay the cooperative for all the work done in his field, and on the other hand, he also obtains remuneration from the cooperative for all the work done by him and his family members for the cooperative with their own draught animals and machines. This type of cooperative is very basic.
    In the second type of cooperative, farmers cultivate land in fields where boundaries have been removed, thus creating conditions for planned crop rotation. Members cultivate and sow together, and the harvest is distributed according to the amount of land each farmer contributed when joining the cooperative. On the combined land, large agricultural machines can be better used, which will naturally reduce production costs. However, in this type of cooperative, it is still difficult to jointly manage livestock production, because the livestock is still used by the members themselves.
    The advanced types of cooperatives, namely the third and fourth types of cooperatives, are generally characterized by the fact that members of these cooperatives combine agricultural production and animal husbandry production. In the third type of cooperative, the majority of the income is distributed according to labor, and only a small portion (10%-15%) is distributed according to the amount of land contributed by the farmers. In the fourth type of cooperative, the income is distributed entirely according to labor.
    By the beginning of September 1955, 6,780 unified agricultural production cooperatives of the second, third and fourth types had been established in 47.6% of the country's rural areas, and together with state-owned farms, they occupied 42% of the country's cultivated land.
    Today, the unified agricultural production cooperative has become the most important factor in agricultural production in Czechoslovakia. Agricultural production cooperatives have achieved success in both agricultural and animal husbandry production. This is particularly evident in the 1954 economic summary of the cooperatives. On a national scale, the average yield per hectare of cooperatives exceeded that of individual farmers.
    Machine tractor stations play a major role in striving for high yields of crops and high productivity of livestock in unified agricultural production cooperatives. The equipment of mechanized tools in machine tractor stations is improving year by year. Today, on average, every 100 hectares of cultivated land in unified agricultural production cooperatives has one tractor from a machine tractor station. Despite this, the Tenth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia still charged the government with further expanding the mechanization of basic field work and labor-intensive operations in animal husbandry production. By 1957, the mechanization of field work in unified agricultural production cooperatives will reach such a degree that it will increase to 90% in autumn plowing, 70% in sowing autumn crops, 65% in planting root crops, and 50% in harvesting grains. A high degree of mechanization will replace the heavy labor of farmers and increase the income of cooperative members. Machine tractor stations charge only lower fees when helping unified agricultural production cooperatives.
    The assistance of machine tractor stations has enabled cooperatives to rapidly increase labor productivity, greatly exceeding that of individual farmer economies. In 1953, each member of the cooperative harvested an average of 1,745 kilograms of wheat and barley per hectare of land, while individual farmers only harvested 550 kilograms per person.
    What are the general economic results of the unified agricultural production cooperatives in Czechoslovakia? The agricultural production cooperative in the village of Lesonice, located on the Českomoravská Highlands, which has relatively poor land, can be taken as an example. In the five years of collective management (1949-1953), this cooperative built four livestock sheds, three pigsties, four poultry farms, two farrowing houses for sows, 16 calf sheds, three chick farms, one stable and five barns. In 1954, the members of the cooperative achieved better results than originally planned in both agricultural and animal husbandry production.
    For example, the planned yield of wheat per hectare was 28 quintals (i.e. 2,800 kilograms), but the actual harvest was 29.6 quintals; the planned yield of potatoes was 170 quintals, but the actual yield was 192 quintals; the planned yield of sugar beet was 250 quintals, but the actual yield was 352 quintals.
    The members of the Lesonice village cooperative also achieved equally good results in animal husbandry production. They obtained an average of 108 kilograms of pork, 73 kilograms of beef, 380 liters of milk and 195 eggs per hectare of land. The 100 dairy cows owned by the cooperative had an average milk yield of 1,615 liters per cow per year.
    These achievements enabled the cooperative members to increase their income in 1954 by half compared with 1952, greatly increased the daily wage of the cooperative, and increased the appropriation for the cultural needs of the members. Today, in addition to receiving in-kind payments of four kilograms of grain, five kilograms of potatoes and one and a half kilograms of hay per labor day, the members of this cooperative can also receive 28 crowns (Czechoslovak currency) in cash. Therefore, the income of members of the unified agricultural production cooperatives in Czechoslovakia is often higher than the average wage of ordinary employees. In addition, the income from those small personal economies (homestead plots) should also be included. Therefore, after settling accounts with the cooperative in 1954, the members of the Lesonice village cooperative purchased eight new motorcycles, several electric washing machines and radios, etc.
    The good economic results of the Lesonice village cooperative have led to an increase in the cooperative's reserve fund and improved the cooperative's social welfare measures. Now the cooperative also stipulates that any member who fulfills his labor obligations, if he is the head of the household, will still be given the remuneration of one labor day per day when he is sick, and if he is not the head of the household, he will be given half a labor day. From June 1st of last year, the cooperative also regularly provides subsidies for children under the age of 14. In the event of the death of a cooperative member, his family can receive a one-time subsidy of one thousand crowns.
    Several hundred other unified agricultural production cooperatives in Czechoslovakia have also achieved similar results. Many other cooperatives have reached the best indicators. After the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in June 1955 formulated a plan to further intensify socialist construction in the countryside, 436 new unified agricultural production cooperatives were established by last October. The above-mentioned facts prove that the summary of the economic management of unified agricultural production cooperatives has convinced tens of thousands of small and middle peasants of the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives. These all best prove that the agricultural cooperation movement in Czechoslovakia is constantly consolidating and developing.

    捷克斯洛伐克的农业生产合作社
    捷克斯洛伐克  扬·斯塔雷伊
    捷克斯洛伐克从1948年开始走上建设社会主义的道路。这些年来，在大力发展工业的同时，也在农村中按照苏联的榜样开展农业生产合作化的运动。小农和中农根据统一农业生产合作社的模范章程自愿地组织起来了。这个章程规定了合作社社员的权利和义务，同时告诉合作社社员应当怎样更好地经营农业。捷克斯洛伐克共产党和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府用各种方法支持农业合作化运动的发展，并给合作社以各种优待：机器拖拉机站的帮助，优惠的贷款，肥料，种子，饲料，规定得比个体农民为低的义务缴售额，以及其他等等。
    按照合作社社员在经营集体经济和分配共同劳动的收入方面所采取的不同方式，在捷克斯洛伐克出现了四种类型的统一农业生产合作社。
    第一类合作社是：社员进行集体播种，但同时保留各自的地界。在这里，社员们共同进行田间工作，并集体利用合作社和私人的机器和役畜。但是社员收割庄稼时则是单独进行，各人收各人的地段。在结算时，每个农民须偿付合作社在他的田地中所作的一切工作的代价，另一方面，他也从合作社取得他和他的家庭成员以自己的役畜和机器为合作社所作的一切工作的报酬。这类合作社是很低级的。
    在第二类合作社中，农民们在取消了界限的田地里进行耕作，这样就为有计划的轮作造成了条件。社员们一块儿耕地和下种，收获物则按农民入社时的土地入股数量来分配。在联合起来的土地上，能够更好地采用大型农业机器，这自然会使生产成本减低。但是在这类合作社中，共同经营畜牧业生产仍有困难，因为牲畜仍归社员各人自己使用。
    高级型式的合作社，即第三类和第四类合作社的一般的特点是，这类合作社的社员把农业生产和畜牧业生产都联合起来。在第三种类型的合作社中，收入的大部分是按劳动来分配的，只有较少的一部分（10％—15％）是按农民土地入股的数量分配。而在第四类合作社中，收入是完全按照劳动进行分配的。
    到1955年9月初为止，已经在全国47.6％的农村里建立了6，780个第二、三、四类的统一农业生产合作社，它们同国营农场一起占有全国耕地的42％。
    今天，统一农业生产合作社已成为捷克斯洛伐克农业生产中的最重要的因素。无论在农业和畜牧业的生产方面，农业生产合作社都取得了成绩。这特别明显地表现在1954年合作社的经济总结中。在全国范围内，合作社的每公顷收获量平均都超过了个体农民。
    机器拖拉机站在争取统一农业生产合作社的农作物高额产量和牲畜的高度产品生产率方面，起着重大作用。机器拖拉机站的机械化工具的装备在逐年改善。今天，统一农业生产合作社的每一百公顷耕地，平均有机器拖拉机站的一台拖拉机。尽管这样，捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会仍责成政府要更加扩大基本田间工作和畜牧业生产中费力操作过程的机械化。到1957年，在统一农业生产合作社中，田间工作的机械化将达到这样的程度，在秋耕工作中提高到90％，在播种秋播作物的工作中提高到70％，在种植块根作物的工作中提高到65％，在收获谷物的工作中提高到50％。高度的机械化将代替农民的繁重劳动并提高合作社社员的收入。机器拖拉机站帮助统一农业生产合作社的时候，只收取较低的费用。
    机器拖拉机站的帮助使得合作社迅速提高了劳动生产率，而大大地超过个体农民经济。1953年合作社的每个社员在每一公顷土地上平均收获了1，745公斤小麦和大麦，而个体农民则每人只收获了550公斤。
    捷克斯洛伐克统一农业生产合作社的一般经济结果究竟怎样，可以把位在契什科马拉夫高原上一个土地比较贫瘠的列索尼茨村的农业生产合作社作为例子。在集体经营的五年中（1949年—1953年），这个合作社修建了四个畜舍，三个猪圈，四个养禽场，两所为母猪设的产房，16个小牛牛舍，三个雏鸡场，一所马厩和五个谷仓。1954年，合作社的社员无论在农业或畜牧业的生产方面都取得了比原定计划更好的成绩。
    例如，小麦每公顷产量原定计划为28公担（即2，800公斤），结果收获29.6公担，马铃薯原定170公担，实际收了192公担，甜菜原定250公担，实际收了352公担。
    列索尼茨村的合作社社员们在畜牧业生产方面也取得了同样良好的成绩。他们从每公顷土地上平均获得108公斤猪肉，73公斤牛肉，380公升牛奶和195个鸡蛋。合作社所拥有的一百头乳牛，每头牛的挤奶量平均每年为1，615公升。
    这些成绩使得合作社的社员1954年的收入比1952年提高了一半，大大提高了合作社的劳动日报酬，和用于社员的文化需要的拨款。今天这个合作社的社员每个劳动日除了可以得到四公斤谷物、五公斤马铃薯和一公斤半干草的实物支付外，还可以获得28个克朗（捷克斯洛伐克币）的现款。因此，捷克斯洛伐克统一农业生产合作社社员的收入往往是高于普通职员的平均工资的。此外，还应该把那些不大的个人经济（宅旁园地）中得到的收入包括进去。因此，1954年在同合作社结账以后，列索尼茨村合作社的社员们新添购了八部摩托车，几部电气洗衣机和收音机等。
    列索尼茨村合作社很好地经营经济的结果，使得社里的公积金有了增加，并能改善社里的社会福利措施。现在这个合作社还规定，凡完成自己劳动义务的社员，如果他是户主，在他生病的时候每天仍给予一个劳动日的报酬，如果不是户主，则给予半个劳动日的报酬。从去年6月1日起，合作社还定期给予14岁以下的孩子补助金。在合作社社员死亡时，他的家庭可一次领得一千克朗的补助金。
    捷克斯洛伐克的另外几百个统一农业生产合作社也获得了相似的成绩。还有很多的合作社达到了最好的指标。在捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会1955年6月全会制定了在农村中更加加紧建设社会主义的计划以后，到去年10月，又建立了436个新的统一农业生产合作社。上述事实证明，统一农业生产合作社经营经济的总结，已经使成千上万的小农和中农信服了农业生产合作社生产的优越性。这些都最好不过地证明，捷克斯洛伐克农业合作化运动正在不断地巩固和发展着。
