    Several Questions Concerning the Regulations on the Service of Officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    Question: Why are reserve officers divided into first and second classes according to age?
    Answer: The division of reserve officers into first and second classes according to age is for the purpose of facilitating peacetime training and wartime conscription of reserve officers. In wartime, when reserve officers are called back into the active service, the first-class reserve officers, who are generally more robust, are usually conscripted first, and second-class reserve officers are conscripted when necessary.

    Question: Are cadres who have been transferred or demobilized from the army in the past incorporated into the officer reserve?
    Answer: The "Notice on Registering Cadres at Platoon Level and Above Transferred from the Army to Local Work as Reserve Cadres of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" issued by the former Personnel Department of the Central People's Government and the General Cadre Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government in October 1950 was a transitional measure prior to the promulgation of the Regulations on the Service of Officers. Now that the Regulations on the Service of Officers have been promulgated, all cadres who have been transferred or demobilized from the army in the past, who meet the conditions for reserve officers, will be incorporated into the officer reserve, granted the rank of reserve officer, and issued certificates for reserve officers.
    Specific measures for granting reserve officer ranks and incorporating transferred and demobilized cadres who meet the requirements for serving as reserve officers into the officer reserve will be stipulated separately in the future.

    Question: Can cadres who have already been transferred apply for active service?
    Answer: In the past, the transfer of army cadres to local work was to meet the needs of the country's economic construction and national defense construction. Therefore, all comrades who have already been transferred to local work should settle down to local work and strive to carry out socialist construction and socialist transformation. Reserve cadres who are determined to be reserve officers in the future may, in accordance with Article 51 of the Regulations on the Service of Officers, apply for active service with the approval of the organization.

    Question: What kind of professional knowledge is required for graduates of institutions of higher learning to be granted the rank of reserve officer?
    Answer: Graduates of institutions of higher learning who possess various professional skills needed by the army, such as aviation, shipbuilding, machinery, civil engineering, meteorology, telecommunications, electrical engineering, medical service, veterinary medicine, fuel, physical chemistry, finance and economics, politics and law, translation, transportation, and other professional and technical knowledge, and who can serve as officers, may be granted the rank of reserve officer. Article 47, Item 4 of the Regulations on the Service of Officers includes students who have graduated from institutions of higher learning.

    Question: How are reserve officers trained? Are transferred cadres currently participating in training?
    Answer: Specific regulations regarding the training of reserve officers will be issued later. Transferred cadres will not be organized for training until they are incorporated into the officer reserve.

    Question: What are the rights and obligations of reserve officers?
    Answer: In accordance with the Military Service Law and the Regulations on the Service of Officers, reserve officers have the rights and obligations to be promoted in rank as stipulated, to be called to participate in training, to wear military uniforms and receive subsidies from the training organs during the training period, and to be conscripted into active service to serve as active officers.

    有关中国人民解放军军官服役条例的若干问题
    问：军官预备役为什么按年龄分为一、二两等？
    答：规定军官预备役按年龄分为一等和二等，是为了便于对预备役军官平时集训和战时征召。在战时征召回军队中服现役的预备役军官，一般地是先征召比较精壮的一等预备役军官，必要时再征召二等预备役军官。
    问：过去由军队转业、复员的干部，是否编入军官预备役？
    答：1950年10月原中央人民政府人事部和中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总干部部关于登记由军队转业到地方工作的排以上干部作为中国人民解放军预备役干部的通知，是在颁布军官服役条例以前的过渡办法。现在军官服役条例已经颁布，过去所有由军队转业、复员的干部，凡符合预备役军官条件者，将编入军官预备役，授予预备役军官军衔，并发给预备役军官的证件。
    关于对符合服军官预备役的转业、复员干部，授予预备役军官军衔和编入军官预备役的具体办法，将来另有规定。
    问：已经转业的干部可否申请服现役？
    答：过去军队干部转业到地方工作，是为了适应国家的经济建设和国防建设的需要。因此，凡是已经转业到地方工作的同志，都应该安心地方工作，努力进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业。转业干部将来确定为预备役军官的，依照军官服役条例第51条的规定，由本人提出申请经组织批准，可以服现役。
    问：已经毕业的高等学校的学生，需要具有何种专业知识才能被授予预备役军官军衔？
    答：已经在高等学校毕业的学生，凡具有军队需要的各种专业技术，如具有航空、造船、机械、土木、气象、电信、电机、医务、兽医、油料、理化、财经、政法、翻译、交通运输等专业技术知识，并可以担任军官职务的人，才可以授予预备役军官军衔。军官服役条例第47条第四项规定，包括已经在高等学校毕业的学生在内。
    问：预备役军官如何集训？转业干部目前是否参加集训？
    答：预备役军官的集训问题，以后会有具体规定。转业干部在未编入军官预备役以前，不组织集训。
    问：预备役军官有什么权利和义务？
    答：依照兵役法和军官服役条例的规定，预备役军官有按规定晋升军衔、应召参加集训、集训期间着军服和从集训机关领取补助金、应征服现役担任现役军官职务等权利和义务。
