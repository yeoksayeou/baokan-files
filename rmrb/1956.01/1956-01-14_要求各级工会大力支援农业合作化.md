Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions demands that trade union organizations at all levels strengthen their work in all aspects and vigorously support agricultural cooperativization. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions pointed out during its discussion of this issue that all trade union organizations must formulate work plans regarding trade union support for agricultural cooperativization when comprehensively planning trade union work.

This conference believes that trade union organizations in all production and supply departments should strive to improve their work, launch socialist emulation drives, and produce and supply farmers with more and better supplies. State-owned farms, livestock farms, and machine tractor stations are important places for carrying out communist education for farmers. The trade union work of these units must be strengthened. Trade union organizations in all state-owned farms, livestock farms, and machine tractor stations must be gradually established and improved to strengthen their connection with and guidance to agricultural production cooperatives and livestock cooperatives.

The conference pointed out that the socialist emulation drive to support agricultural cooperativization, initiated by the staff and workers of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory to agricultural implement manufacturing factories across the country, has already been launched. This demonstrates the great initiative of agricultural machinery factory workers across the country to support agricultural cooperativization. Therefore, the National Committee of the First Machinery Trade Union should strengthen its leadership over the inter-factory competition of agricultural machinery factories across the country, widely exchange advanced experiences, and produce more, better, and cheaper new-style agricultural tools for farmers in a timely manner. At the same time, local trade union organizations must pay attention to the repair and assembly work of agricultural tools, and organize handicraft workers to do a good job in the repair and assembly of agricultural tools. The National Committee of the Heavy Industry Trade Union and the trade union organizations of local industries should mobilize employees to find ways to produce more and cheaper fertilizers for farmers. The Light Industry Trade Union and the Textile Industry Trade Union must mobilize employees to strive to complete and overfulfill the state's production plan to ensure the supply of durable daily necessities with a variety of colors and styles to farmers. Employees in commercial departments should do a good job in the purchase of agricultural and sideline products and the supply of industrial products. The National Committee of the Education Trade Union should make preparations and actively cooperate with relevant departments to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy among rural youths. In addition, local trade union organizations must strengthen the work of uniting medical workers and scientific and technological workers.

    要求各级工会大力支援农业合作化
    新华社13日讯  中华全国总工会要求工会各级组织加强各方面的工作，大力支援农业合作化。中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会第四次全体会议讨论这个问题的时候指出，各工会组织在全面规划工会工作的时候，必须订出关于工会组织支援农业合作化的工作计划。
    这次会议认为一切生产部门和供应部门的工会组织都应该努力改进自己的工作，开展社会主义竞赛，生产和供应农民更多更好的用品。国营农场、畜牧场和机器拖拉机站，是对农民进行共产主义教育的重要场所。必须加强这些单位的工会工作。必须把所有国营农场、畜牧场和机器拖拉机站的工会组织逐步建立和健全起来，加强他们对农业生产合作社、畜牧合作社的联系和辅导工作。
    这次会议指出，北京农业机械厂职工向全国农具制造厂提出的开展支援农业合作化的社会主义竞赛，已经开展起来了。这表现了全国农业机械厂职工对支援农业合作化的极大的主动性。因此第一机械工会全国委员会应该加强对全国农业机械厂的厂际竞赛的领导，广泛交流先进经验，及时为农民生产更多、更好、更便宜的新式农具。同时，各地方工会组织必须关心农具修配工作，组织手工业工人做好农具的修理和装配工作。重工业工会全国委员会和地方工业的工会组织，应该发动职工想办法为农民生产更多更便宜的肥料。轻工业工会和纺织工业工会必须动员职工努力完成和超额完成国家的生产计划，保证把花色多、式样好、经久耐用的日用品供应农民。商业部门中的职工，要做好农产品副产品的收购和工业品的供应工作。教育工会全国委员会应做好准备工作，配合有关部门积极完成农村青年的扫盲任务。此外，各地方工会组织必须加强团结医务工作者和科学技术工作者的工作。
