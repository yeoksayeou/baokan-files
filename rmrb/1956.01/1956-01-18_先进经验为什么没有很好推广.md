Why Advanced Experience Has Not Been Well Promoted

Wang Yunxin, Acting Secretary of the CPC Datong Coal Mine Committee

Since 1950, the state-owned Datong Coal Mine has successively promoted advanced experiences and working methods such as the longwall retreating mining method, the large roof caving method, workface chart operations and transport chart operations, and rapid tunneling, which have improved the management of the enterprise and increased production. Recently, after implementing the advanced management experience of Fuxin Ping'an No. 1 Mine in compiling operation plans, operation regulations, leadership duty schedules, and production dispatch, the efficiency of regular cycles has also improved. In some workfaces, the full-staff efficiency reached 5.6 tons, exceeding the plan by 14.42%. Since the third quarter of last year, the consumption of pit timber and explosives has been greatly reduced and costs have been significantly reduced by promoting advanced experiences such as "team economic accounting" and "methods for saving pit timber and explosives".

However, we still have serious shortcomings in learning and promoting advanced experience. Zhang Wanfu's tunneling team averaged over 700 meters of tunneling per month in the third quarter of last year, reaching 809 meters in September, and the cost was lower than planned. If all tunneling teams in the bureau promoted their experience and increased the monthly progress efficiency to 500 meters, then the entire bureau could tunnel more than 55,000 meters more per year. This would not only reduce six tunneling teams, but also reverse the situation where tunneling cannot keep up with mining. However, Zhang Wanfu's tunneling team's advanced experience has not been widely promoted. Many teams fail to meet the quota, and some teams only tunnel more than 100 meters per month.

What is preventing us from vigorously promoting these advanced experiences?

First of all, leading cadres at all levels have not truly recognized that promoting advanced experience is the most effective way to improve production. Various units often "fish for three days and dry the nets for two," without a long-term plan for promoting advanced experience. When problems arise in implementation, they are ignored and no active solutions are sought. When encountering resistance from conservative thinking, they lose confidence and sometimes even echo it. Soviet experts once suggested putting the pillar recovery winch in the coal roadway tailgate. This is both safer and saves the trouble of moving it every time. However, because of some difficulties, no one implemented it.

Secondly, arrogance and complacency are at play. On the one hand, they look down on or do not believe in the advanced experience of others, and on the other hand, they use "conditions are not yet ripe" as an excuse to refuse to learn and promote the experience created by others. Zhang Wanfu created a new tunneling record of more than 800 meters per month, but many tunneling teams said that their "coal seam is low, the roadway is flat" and "there are many roadways and many electric drills" (which is not the case), and they do not seriously study and promote it, and even deliberately exaggerate the shortcomings of the Zhang Wanfu team.

Thirdly, management work cannot keep up. The leadership has not provided convenience in terms of time and place for the trial and promotion of advanced experience, nor has it promptly incorporated the already successfully implemented advanced experience into regulations and systems, and has not helped grassroots cadres overcome the difficulties in promotion. Some workers are not actively learning advanced experience because the wage quota is unreasonable, and we have not paid attention to this issue.

The poor promotion of advanced experience is also due to the lack of strong leadership from the Party organization and the lack of in-depth ideological education for the workers. Comrades who do ideological education work have not studied various advanced experiences well, so they cannot effectively conduct propaganda and education to the masses. For example, for a considerable period of time, we always thought that the main experience of the Zhang Wanfu team was relay slotting. However, in fact, the main reason why the Zhang Wanfu tunneling team was able to continue to over fulfill the plan after the situation changed was that they adopted multi-section roadway transportation, tight work connection, and good mutual cooperation. Since we do not understand the content of advanced experience, we certainly cannot effectively overcome formalism in promoting advanced experience.

In order to strive to complete the tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, we have decided to systematically promote the management experience of regular cycle operation of Fuxin Ping'an No. 1 Mine and the Soviet Union's one-shift production and two-shift preparation experience this year to overcome the chaos in management work and further develop production potential. We will also continue to promote the experience of team accounting, youth thrift teams, and youth supervision posts to reduce production costs. In terms of tunneling, we plan to promote the rapid tunneling experience of Li Baoshu and Zhang Wanfu to reverse the situation where tunneling cannot keep up with mining; learn from the experience of Fuxin Ping'an No. 1 Mine and Shandong Hongshan Coal Mine in mining thin coal seams, as well as the coal mining methods of wooden plank false roofs and metal mesh of other brother coal mines, to improve technical level and recovery rate. In terms of safety production, we must continue to promote the experience of roof management and the "three-person mutual aid group" of safety nets to eliminate or reduce accidents.

In order to do a good job in promoting advanced experience, in addition to using advanced experience training courses and other forms to organize cadres and workers to learn, we also plan to organize visits and exchanges, so that cadres and workers can correctly understand advanced experience, be convinced, and overcome conservative thinking and complacency.

In terms of organizational work, it has been decided that there should be dedicated personnel for technical guidance, dedicated personnel for political work, and timely resolution of problems encountered in the promotion process. Before promotion, pilot work must be done well. During the promotion process, the labor organization, technical trades, and technical grades should also be adjusted according to the technical conditions of advanced experience.

### 先进经验为什么没有很好推广

    先进经验为什么没有很好推广
    中共大同煤矿委员会代书记　王蕴心
    自1950年以来，国营大同煤矿曾先后推广了长壁后退采煤法、大冒顶顶板管理法、工作面图表作业和搬运图表作业以及快速掘进等先进经验和工作方法，改进了企业的管理，提高了生产。最近，在推行了阜新平安一坑编制作业计划、作业规程、领导值班、生产调度等先进管理经验以后，正规循环效率也有了提高。有的工作面，全员效率曾达到5.6吨，超过计划14.42％。从去年第三季度推广“班组经济核算”“坑木火药节省办法”等先进经验以来，坑木和火药的消耗大大减少，成本显著降低。
    但是，我们在学习和推广先进经验方面还有严重的缺点。张万福掘进组在去年第三季每月平均掘进700公尺以上，9月份达到809公尺，成本也比计划低。如果全局各个掘进小组都推广他们的经验，把月进效率提高到500公尺，那末全局全年就可以多掘进55，000多公尺。这不仅可以减少六个掘进组，还可以扭转掘进赶不上回采的局面。但是，张万福掘进组的先进经验没有普遍推广。许多小组达不到定额，有的组每月掘进仅100多公尺。
    是什么东西阻碍我们去大力推广这些先进经验呢？
    首先是各级领导人员没有真正认识到推广先进经验是提高生产的最有效的办法。各个单位常常是“三天打鱼，两天晒网”，没有一个长期的推广先进经验计划。推行中发生了问题，置之不理，不积极地谋求解决。遇到保守思想的抵触，就失去了信心，有时还随声附和。苏联专家曾建议把回柱绞车放到煤巷顺槽里去。这样既安全，又省得每次移动它。但是，因为有些困难，就没有人执行。
    其次是骄傲自满情绪作祟。一方面看不起或不相信别人的先进经验，另一方面又以“条件还不成熟”为借口，拒绝学习和推广人家创造的经验。张万福创造了月进800公尺以上的掘进新纪录，不少掘进组却说他们的“煤层低、巷道平”、“巷道多、电钻多”（实际上并非如此），不认真学习和推广，甚至故意夸大张万福小组的缺点。
    再次是管理工作跟不上。领导上没有在时间、地点等方面给予试验和推广先进经验的便利，也没有把已经推行成功的先进经验及时吸收到规程制度中去，没有帮助基层干部克服推广中的困难。有的职工因工资定额不合理，不积极学习先进经验，我们也没有重视这个问题。
    先进经验推广得不好，还由于党组织对这一工作缺乏坚强的领导和对职工缺乏深入的思想教育。做思想教育工作的同志，没有很好研究各种先进经验，所以就不能有效地向群众进行宣传教育。例如，在一个相当长的时间内，我们总认为张万福组的经验主要是接力掏槽。但是，实际上张万福掘进组之所以在情况变化以后仍然能够继续超额完成计划，主要在于他们采取多段巷道运输，工种衔接紧凑，互相配合得好。我们既然弄不清先进经验的内容，当然就不能有效地克服推广先进经验中的形式主义。
    为了争取提早完成第一个五年计划所规定的任务，我们决定在今年内有计划地推广阜新平安一坑正规循环作业的管理经验和苏联的一班生产两班准备的经验，以克服管理工作中的混乱现象，进一步发挥生产潜力。我们也将继续推行班组核算、青年节约队、青年监督岗的经验，以降低生产成本。在掘进方面，我们准备推行李宝书、张万福快速掘进经验，以扭转掘进赶不上回采的局面；学习阜新平安一坑和山东洪山煤矿采薄煤层的经验，以及其他兄弟煤矿的木板假顶和金属网的采煤方法，以提高技术水平和回采率。在安全生产方面，要继续推行顶板管理、安全网“三人互助组”的经验，以消灭或减少事故。
    为了做好先进经验的推广工作，我们除了要利用先进经验训练班等形式组织干部和工人学习外，还准备组织参观和访问，以便使干部和工人们正确认识先进经验，心服口服，克服保守思想和自满情绪。
    在组织工作方面，决定要有专人作技术指导，有专人做政治工作，及时解决推广过程中遇到的问题。推广以前，要做好试点工作。在推广过程中，还要根据先进经验的技术条件，调整劳动组织、技术工种和技术等级。
