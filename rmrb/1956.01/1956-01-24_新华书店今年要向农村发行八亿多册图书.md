Xinhua Bookstore to Distribute Over 818 Million Books to Rural Areas This Year

This year, Xinhua Bookstore plans to distribute over 818 million books to rural areas, accounting for 58% of the bookstore's total annual book distribution. This requirement was put forward at the Second Branch Manager Meeting recently convened by the Xinhua Bookstore Head Office. The meeting determined that rural distribution work should be the primary task for the entire year; it also decided to vigorously strengthen the distribution of scientific and technological books, various popular readings, and children's books.

The meeting requested that 1,411 million books be distributed throughout the year, equivalent to 202% of the total number distributed last year. The meeting decided that local Xinhua Bookstores should vigorously assist supply and marketing cooperatives in rural areas with the supply of books, and gradually make supply and marketing cooperatives the main force in rural distribution work. In addition, it is necessary to rely on the Communist Youth League's organizations in rural areas, as well as various social forces such as rural libraries and rural postal stations, to jointly carry out the distribution work in the vast rural areas.

    新华书店今年要向农村发行八亿多册图书
    新华书店今年要向农村发行81，800多万册图书，占书店全年发行图书总数的58％。这是新华书店总店最近召开的第二次分店经理会议提出的要求。这次会议确定把农村发行工作作为全年工作的首要任务；还确定要大力加强科学技术书籍、各种通俗读物和儿童读物的发行工作。
    会议要求全年发行图书141，100万册，等于去年发行总册数的202％。会议决定各地新华书店要大力协助农村中的供销合作社供应图书，并且逐渐使供销合作社成为农村发行工作的主要力量。另外，还要依靠中国新民主主义青年团在农村中的组织以及组织农村图书室、农村邮递站等各种社会力量，共同做好广大农村的发行工作。　　　（据新华社讯）
