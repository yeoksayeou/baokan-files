    "Sharing the Same Breath, Sharing the Same Fate"
    He Zhenji, the Party Branch Secretary of Quanji Township in Linhe County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, discovered that a small number of peasant households in the township who were living in very difficult circumstances had not yet signed up to join the cooperative. He immediately went to the villages to gather these farmers for a discussion. It turned out that they didn't not want to join the cooperative, but still had concerns about doing so. For example, Li Daxi and several other households were worried that because they were disabled, they would not be able to work after joining the cooperative and would not be able to earn work points. Liu Yongde and several other households were concerned that joining the cooperative would require paying a share fund, which they could not afford. The Party Branch Secretary cited the fact that Xu Kaitai, who was also disabled, had earned 40 workdays last year after joining the cooperative by doing some light work, to show that disabled people could also join the cooperative. In addition, he explained that the state's poverty alleviation cooperative fund loans would help them solve the difficulty of paying the share fund. After the discussion, six households signed up to join the cooperative that night, and several other households were also considering joining.
    This incident tells us that some poor households have not joined the cooperative, not because they lack socialist enthusiasm, but because they have various concerns. The task of the Party organization is to dispel their concerns and promote their socialist enthusiasm. We cannot be indifferent to such farmers just because there are so few of them. Only in this way can we truly achieve "sharing the same breath, sharing the same fate" with the broad masses of the people.

    “同呼吸，共命运”
    内蒙古自治区临河县全济乡的支部书记何振基发现，全乡还有少部分生活很困难的农户没有报名入社，就马上到村子去召集这些农户座谈。原来他们并不是不想入社，而是对入社还有顾虑。比如李大喜等几户是因为自己残废，怕入社不能劳动，挣不到工分；刘永德等几户是耽心入社要缴股份基金，自己拿不出来。支部书记就举出身体残废的徐开泰去年入社后作些轻活还挣了40个劳动日的事实，说明身体残废的人同样可以入社；另外，还说明国家的贫农合作基金贷款会帮助他们解决交纳股份基金的困难。经过座谈，当晚就有六户报名入社，另外几户也在酝酿入社。
    这件事告诉我们，有些贫困户没有入社，并不是他们没有社会主义积极性，而是因为有各种各样的顾虑。党组织的任务就是要打消他们的顾虑，发扬他们的社会主义积极性，不能因为这样的农户少，就可以漠不关心。这才算真正作到了与广大群众“同呼吸，共命运”。
