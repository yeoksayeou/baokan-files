　　The Road of Chinese Character Reform
　　Wu Yuzhang

　　China's character reform work is being carried out under the guidance of the following principles regarding character reform from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. That is to say, Chinese characters must be reformed, and Chinese character reform must follow the common phonetic direction of world writing systems. Before the realization of phoneticization, Chinese characters must be simplified to facilitate current applications, and active preparations for phoneticization must be carried out simultaneously.

　　In accordance with this principle, we have carried out the following tasks in the past year:

　　First, the simplification and organization of Chinese characters. In early 1955, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee issued a "Draft Plan for the Simplification of Chinese Characters." The draft was widely discussed and revised and was adopted by the National Conference on Writing Reform held in October 1955. This first plan for the simplification of Chinese characters will soon be submitted to the State Council for promulgation and implementation.

　　This first plan for the simplification of Chinese characters contains 519 simplified Chinese characters and 54 simplified radicals. Among commonly used Chinese characters, there are around 1,200 characters containing these 54 radicals. Therefore, the implementation of this plan can actually simplify more than 1,700 Chinese characters. From May 1955, most newspapers and periodicals began to pilot two batches of 141 simplified Chinese characters, which were warmly welcomed by the masses. We also formulated a "Draft First List of Variant Characters for Consolidation," which has been adopted by the National Conference on Writing Reform. According to this list, 1,055 variant characters will be eliminated. This list has been issued to news, publishing, and printing units by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Writing Reform Committee for implementation.

　　Second, preparatory work for the fundamental reform of Chinese characters. The first step is to promote Putonghua (Mandarin Chinese), using Beijing pronunciation as the standard. In July 1955, the Ministry of Education issued a notice to the education departments and bureaus of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions regarding the establishment of Putonghua training classes for primary school language teachers. Many provinces, cities, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have already started or are in the process of carrying out this work. The National Conference on Writing Reform in 1955 resolved the long-standing debate in the linguistic community about what constitutes Putonghua, and unanimously agreed on the definition of "Putonghua - the common language of the Han nationality - based on Northern dialects and using Beijing pronunciation as the standard." It also decided on the principle of "focusing on promotion and gradually popularizing it." Vigorously promoting Putonghua is, in fact, reducing obstacles to the fundamental reform of writing and preparing for the phoneticization of writing.

　　The second step is to draft a Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. By the end of 1955, the initial draft of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme had been completed, and it will soon be published to solicit opinions from all sectors of society, so that it can be revised in the shortest possible time and submitted to the government for adoption.

　　The third step is to advocate and promote horizontal typesetting in newspapers and periodicals. In the past year, the number of newspapers and periodicals adopting horizontal typesetting has gradually increased. National newspapers have all switched to horizontal typesetting since January 1, 1956, and most provincial newspapers have already switched or are preparing to switch to horizontal typesetting. According to statistics at the end of 1955, out of 372 periodicals nationwide, 298 used horizontal typesetting, accounting for 80.1%. From 1956, all national periodicals, with the exception of one or two that still use vertical typesetting, have switched to horizontal typesetting. In the past year, the use of horizontal typesetting in books has also gradually increased.

　　However, the work of the past year is only the beginning of the character reform work. In order to further promote the reform of Chinese characters and gradually realize the phoneticization of writing, it is still necessary to carry out the following aspects of work step by step in accordance with the established principles of character reform.

　　Regarding the simplification and organization of Chinese characters. The first plan for the simplification of Chinese characters should be implemented in batches, and all 1,700 simplified Chinese characters should be fully implemented before the summer of 1957. In primary school textbooks and literacy textbooks, simplified characters that have been decided upon should be used as soon as possible.

　　Continue the simplification of Chinese characters. Among the six or seven thousand Chinese characters commonly used in daily life, the first plan for the simplification of Chinese characters has already simplified more than 1,700 characters. It is initially estimated that there are still more than 1,000 characters that should be simplified but have not yet been simplified. We must try our best to collect and publicly solicit new simplified characters, and prepare to propose a second plan for the simplification of Chinese characters within one or two years. Within the next three years, half of the six or seven thousand Chinese characters commonly used in daily life should be simplified. Only then can the work of simplifying Chinese character forms be considered complete.

　　Formulate a list of commonly used Chinese characters. Draw a clear line between the currently used characters (including commonly used characters and characters that are not commonly used but necessary) and the characters that are currently not in use, and formulate a list of commonly used Chinese characters. Then, within the scope of commonly used characters, eliminate variant characters, so as to reduce the number of commonly used characters to a reasonable minimum.

　　Engrave standard copper molds of Chinese characters, so that the printed form is as consistent as possible with the handwritten form, and gradually standardize the specifications of lead type to improve printing quality.

　　Study and improve the Chinese character indexing method. Study and improve the existing indexing methods, or re-formulate a simple and reasonable Chinese character indexing method, and gradually eliminate the current fragmentation and confusion in Chinese character indexing methods.

　　Regarding the promotion of Putonghua. The first is to establish Putonghua promotion committees in each province, city, and autonomous region as leading organizations to promote this work in various places. The second is to train teachers. The focus of promoting Putonghua at present is in schools. Within a certain period of time, language teachers in primary and secondary schools and teacher training schools should receive Putonghua training. The third is to compile teaching materials. A large number of various teaching materials, reading materials, dictionaries, and reference books for teaching Putonghua should be compiled and printed. Compile and print booklets to guide people in various dialect areas to learn Putonghua. Record gramophone records for teaching Putonghua, and produce films for teaching Putonghua. The fourth is to strengthen the research work on the phonetics, vocabulary, and grammar of Putonghua.

　　In addition, radio stations in various places should be fully utilized to vigorously publicize and teach Putonghua in society. In universities, government agencies, and newly built factories and construction sites with workers from all over the country, learning and using Putonghua should be encouraged under possible conditions.

　　Regarding the preparatory work for phoneticization. China must go through a transition period to realize the phoneticization of writing. This is because: (1) The Chinese characters we have used for thousands of years are not phonetic writing, and the general public lacks the habit of phonetic spelling. (2) Our dialects are very complex, and Putonghua has not yet been popularized today. (3) Due to the influence of long-term use of Chinese characters, there are relatively many homophones in Chinese vocabulary. Some words and phrases can be understood when written in Chinese characters, but are difficult to understand when spoken. These three situations determine that the reform of Chinese characters into phonetic writing must have a transition period, so that we have time to overcome these difficulties and prepare for phoneticization.

　　During this transition period, after the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is formulated, it should first be used to annotate Chinese characters, to help teach Chinese characters, primary school textbooks, literacy textbooks, popular reading materials, dictionaries, and dictionaries, and all use this set of phonetic alphabets to annotate Chinese characters. Secondly, it should be interspersed in Chinese characters. The transliteration of foreign names and place names, some scientific terms, and words that do not have appropriate Chinese characters can be spelled with phonetic alphabets. Children and workers and peasants often cannot write some characters when writing compositions, so they can write phonetically as an auxiliary tool for their writing. The third is to help promote Putonghua. Phonetic alphabets are the best tool for teaching Putonghua. This set of alphabets must be used to teach Beijing pronunciation, and a large number of Putonghua reading materials (including reading materials compared with Chinese characters) written in phonetic alphabets must be published to improve the teaching efficiency of Putonghua.

　　Through these steps, the general public can gradually become familiar with phonetic alphabets, familiarize themselves with phonetic spelling methods, and familiarize themselves with the Beijing pronunciation on which this set of alphabets is based, so as to prepare for the promotion of phonetic writing.

　　Secondly, is the trial and experimental work of phonetic writing. It can first be applied to telegrams, using phonetics instead of numerical codes ("four-碼"). Phonetic telegrams can be as accurate as Chinese character telegrams, and this technical problem has been properly solved. Secondly, the application of this set of alphabets should be promoted in books, file catalogs, name indexes, dictionary sections, telephone directories, and telegram directory arrangements.

　　We can also use phonetic alphabets to compile Chinese textbooks for ethnic minorities and foreigners, as well as various reading materials and newspapers and periodicals. We will use phonetic alphabets to translate works of various levels and genres. Conduct on-site pilot teaching of phonetic writing in schools at all levels, agricultural production cooperatives, and various dialect areas, and select certain areas to conduct systematic, comprehensive, and long-term key experimental work.

　　Again, combined with the above-mentioned trial and experimentation, conduct research on phoneticization, gradually improve this phonetic scheme to make it more perfect, and gradually solve several difficult and complex problems that must be solved as a phonetic writing, such as the problem of homophones, the problem of tones, the problem of writing some words, the problem of dealing with classical Chinese components, and the adjustments and adaptations that should be made in promoting phonetic writing in dialect areas, and so on.

　　After experiencing the above-mentioned series of tests, this phonetic scheme has gradually grown into a perfect writing system, and it can be applied in any occasion without difficulty. At that time, it will have sufficient conditions to replace the current Chinese characters, and only then will the transition period for realizing the phoneticization of writing come to an end.

　　This is a rough sketch of our future work. All people who are enthusiastic about and care about character reform and mass education must work actively and strive continuously to strive for the early completion of the phoneticization of Chinese characters!

　　中国文字改革的道路
    吴玉章
    中国的文字改革工作，是在中共中央和毛主席关于文字改革的下述方针的指导之下进行的。这就是说，汉字必须改革，汉字改革要走世界文字共同的拼音方向，而在实现拼音化以前，必须简化汉字，以利目前的应用，同时积极进行拼音化的各项准备工作。
    遵照这一个方针，一年来我们进行了以下几项工作：
    第一，汉字的简化和整理工作。1955年初，中国文字改革委员会颁发了“汉字简化方案草案”。草案经过了广泛的讨论和修订，于1955年10月间召开的全国文字改革会议通过。这个第一次的汉字简化方案，不久将提请国务院发布施行。
    这个第一次的汉字简化方案，包含519个简化汉字和54个简化偏旁。一般通用的汉字里头，包含这54个偏旁的字在1，200个上下，因此实行这个方案，实际得到简化的汉字可以达到1，700多个。1955年5月起，大部分报纸期刊开始试用了两批共141个简化汉字，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。我们还作出了“第一批异体字整理表草案”，已经全国文字改革会议通过。根据这个整理表，将有1，055个异体字被淘汰。这个整理表已经由中华人民共和国文化部和中国文字改革委员会发布给新闻出版印刷单位实施。
    第二，汉字根本改革的准备工作。首先是推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话。1955年7月，教育部向各省、市、自治区教育厅、局发出了关于举办小学语文教师普通话训练班的通知。很多省、市和内蒙自治区，都已经开始或者正在进行这一工作。1955年全国文字改革会议解决了什么是普通话这一个语言学界长期争论的问题，一致同意“以北方话为基础方言，以北京语音为标准音的普通话——汉民族共通语”这一个提法；并且决定了“重点推行，逐步普及”的方针。大力推广普通话事实上也就是减少文字根本改革的障碍，为文字拼音化作准备。
    其次是拟订汉语拼音方案。到1955年年底，汉语拼音方案草案的初稿已经完成，不久将发表出来，征求社会各界意见，以便在最短期内修正后提请政府采用。
    再次是提倡推广报纸期刊的横排。一年来，报纸期刊采用横排的逐渐增多。全国性的报纸，自1956年元旦起全部改为横排，大多数省报已经或者正在准备改为横排。根据1955年年底的统计，全国372种期刊中，横排的有298种，占80.1％。1956年起，全国性的期刊，除了一两种仍用直排外，已经全部改用横排。一年来，图书采用横排的亦在逐渐增多。
    但是，过去一年的工作仅仅是文字改革工作的开端。为了进一步推进汉字的改革，逐步实现文字的拼音化，今后还必须依照文字改革的既定方针，有步骤地进行以下各方面的工作。
    关于汉字简化和整理工作。分批推行第一次的汉字简化方案，在1957年夏季以前将1，700多个简化汉字全部推行完毕。在小学教科书和扫除文盲课本上，已决定简化的字应该尽先使用简字。
    继续汉字的简化工作。在一般日常应用的六、七千个汉字中，第一次的汉字简化方案已经简化了1，700多字，初步估计还有1，000多字，应该加以简化而还没有简化。我们要尽量搜集并公开征求新的简字，准备在一、二年内提出第二次的汉字简化方案。要在今后三年内使得在日常应用的六、七千个汉字中，有一半得到简化，这才算是汉字字形简化工作的完成。
    拟订通用汉字表。把目前通用的字（包括常用字以及虽然不是常用，但是必要的字）同目前已经不通用的字划清界限，订出通用汉字表。然后在通用字的范围内淘汰异体字，使通用字尽量减少到一个合理的最低限度。
    刻制汉字标准的铜模，使印刷体同手写体尽量一致，并且逐步统一铅字规格，以提高印刷质量。
    研究改进汉字的检字法。把现有的各种检字法加以研究改进，或者重新拟制一种简便合理的汉字检字法，逐步消除目前汉字检字法中的分歧混乱现象。
    关于普通话的推广工作。第一是在各省、市、自治区建立推广普通话工作委员会，作为各地推动这个工作的领导机构。第二是训练师资。目前推广普通话的重点是学校。应该在一定时期内，使中小学校和师范学校的语文教师受到普通话的训练。第三是编印教材。应该大量编印教学普通话的各种教材、读物、词典和参考用书。编印指导各方言区人民学习普通话的小册子。灌制教学普通话的留声机片，和摄制教学普通话的电影片。第四是加强普通话的语音、词汇、语法方面的研究工作。
    此外，还应该充分运用各地广播电台在社会上大力宣传和教学普通话。在高等学校、政府机关和工人来自各地的新建工厂和工地，应该在可能条件下提倡学习和使用普通话。
    关于拼音化的准备工作。在中国实现文字拼音化必须经历一个过渡时期。这是因为：（一）我们几千年来使用的汉字不是拼音文字，一般人民缺乏拼音的习惯。（二）我们的方言十分复杂，普通话在今天还没有普及。（三）由于长期使用汉字的影响，汉语词汇中同音词比较多，有些词语用汉字写出来可以懂，说出来就不好懂。这三种情况决定了汉字的改革成为拼音文字，必然要有一个过渡时期，好让我们有时间来克服这些困难，为拼音化作好准备。
    在这个过渡时期中，在汉语拼音方案拟定之后，应该首先用来给汉字注音，帮助教学汉字、小学教科书、扫除文盲用的课本、通俗读物、字典和词典上，都用这套为拼音字母来给汉字注音。其次是在汉字中夹用。外国人名地名的译音，一部分科学名词，没有适当汉字可写的语词，可以就用拼音字母来拼写。儿童和工农作文，往往有些字写不出来，可以就写拼音，作为他们写作的辅助工具。第三是帮助推广普通话。拼音字母是教学普通话的最好的工具，必须运用这套字母来教学北京语音，大量出版用拼音字母编写的各种体裁的普通话读物（包括跟汉字对照的读物），以提高普通话的教学效率。
    通过这些步骤，可以使得广大人民逐渐熟悉拼音字母，熟悉拼音方法，熟悉这套字母所依据的北京语音，为推行拼音文字作好准备。
    其次，是拼音文字的试用和试验工作。首先可以在电报上应用，以拼音代替数字电码（“四码”）。拼音电报可以做到跟汉字电报一样一字不错，这个技术问题已有适当的解决办法。其次，应该在图书、档案编目、人名索引、字典分部、电话簿和电报簿的编排等等方面，推广这套字母的应用。
    我们还可以用拼音字母来编印少数民族和外国人用的汉语课本，以及各种读物和报刊。我们要用拼音字母来翻译各种程度和各种体裁的著作。在各级学校、农业生产合作社和各方言区进行拼音文字的实地试教，并且选择一定地区进行有系统的、全面的、长期的重点试验工作。
    再次，结合以上这些试用和试验，进行对于拼音化的研究工作，逐步改进这个拼音方案，使它更加完善，并且逐步解决作为一种拼音文字所必须解决的若干困难的复杂的问题，例如同音词问题，声调问题，一部分词语的写法问题，文言成分的处理问题，以及在方言区推行拼音文字应当作什么样的调整和适应的问题等等。
    经历了上述一系列的考验，这个拼音方案就已经逐渐生长成为一种完善的文字，无论什么样的场合，它都可以适用，不致发生困难。那时候，它已具备足够的条件来代替现在的汉字，也只有到那个时候，实现文字拼音化的过渡时期才算终了。
    这就是我们今后工作的一个略图。一切热心和关心文字改革和群众教育的人们，必须积极工作，不断努力，争取我国文字拼音化的早日完成！
