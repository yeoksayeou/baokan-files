    Replenish Livestock Early
    The First Branch of Zhongdong Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, recently bought 7 calves, planning to raise them to supplement the cooperative's livestock. When they began discussing buying cattle, some people in the cooperative were against buying calves, believing that calves cannot work, waste manpower and fodder, and are not cost-effective. The cooperative director calculated the costs and benefits with everyone: the entire cooperative has nearly 400 mu of cultivated land, but only 5 head of cattle. Among these 5 cattle, two can be used for 3 to 5 years; and 3 can only be used for about 1 more year. If they don't buy calves quickly, they will lack cattle power in the future. Cattle all grow up from calves; if cooperatives don't raise calves and only buy strong cattle, where will so many strong cattle come from? Besides, raising calves is not a loss; although it costs fodder, it can accumulate a lot of fertilizer. After this calculation, everyone realized the importance of raising calves.
    All cooperatives can calculate their livestock accounts, and if they need to replenish livestock, they should prepare early.

    及早补充畜力
    江苏省泗阳县众东乡农业生产合作社第一分社最近买回了7头小牛，准备喂大以后，补充社里的畜力。在开始讨论买牛的时候，社里有些人不主张买小牛，认为小牛不能干活，白费人工和草料，不合算。社长就和大家一起算了细账：全社有近400亩耕地，只有5头耕牛。这5头牛中有两头能用3年到5年；有3头只能再用1年左右。如果不赶快买小牛，以后牛力就更缺乏了。牛都是从小长大的；如果合作社都不喂小牛，光买壮牛，哪来这许多壮牛呢？再说，喂小牛也不吃亏，虽是费了草料，但是可以积不少肥料。经过这样算账，大家都认识了喂养小牛的重要。
    各合作社都可以算算畜力账，如需要补充畜力，应该及早准备。
