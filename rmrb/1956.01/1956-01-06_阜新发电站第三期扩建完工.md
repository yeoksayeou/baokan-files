    Fuxin Power Plant's Third Phase Expansion Completed

    The third phase expansion project of the Fuxin Thermal Power Plant has been completed ahead of schedule and began supplying electricity at 9:00 PM on December 27, 1955. With this, more than three-quarters of the entire expansion project of the Fuxin Thermal Power Plant has been completed.

    The power generation capacity of this phase is equal to the total power generation capacity of the first and second phases. The amount of work was twice that of the second phase. Due to the active efforts of the staff, this phase used half the number of workers as the second phase and shortened the construction period by more than a month.

    阜新发电站第三期扩建完工
    阜新火力发电站第三期扩建工程已经提前完工，并且在1955年12月27日下午九时开始送电。至此，阜新火力发电站整个扩建工程，已经完成了四分之三以上。
    这期工程的发电量等于一、二两期工程发电量的总和，工程量比第二期工程大了一倍，由于职工积极努力，这一期工程比第二期工程少用了一半工人，缩短工期一个多月。
