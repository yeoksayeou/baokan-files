　　Several Questions Concerning the Regulations on the Service of Officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
　　Question: What are the differences between active-duty officers, reserve officers, and retired officers?
　　Answer: All officers above the rank of Second Lieutenant (including active-duty assigned officers) serving in the Chinese People's Liberation Army are active-duty officers. Reserve officers who do not serve in active duty in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, or officers who have transferred from active duty to reserve duty, are reserve officers; reserve officers have the obligation to serve in active duty. Active-duty officers and reserve officers who have reached the maximum age for reserve service or are completely unable to serve in active duty due to injury, illness, or disability will retire; after retirement, they are retired officers; retired officers no longer serve in active duty or reserve duty.
　　Question: Why is it necessary to stipulate a certain period for rank promotion? Why is the rank promotion period for reserve officers twice as long as that for active-duty officers?
　　Answer: The improvement of an officer's military knowledge and the accumulation of military experience require a certain amount of time. The time required for officers of different rank levels to improve their military knowledge and accumulate military experience varies. In order to unify the rank promotion system, it is necessary to stipulate a certain period for the rank promotion of officers. Since reserve officers serve in non-military departments, their improvement of military knowledge and accumulation of military experience are not as fast as those of active-duty officers. In order to ensure that reserve officers and active-duty officers are basically consistent in quality, the rank promotion period for reserve officers should be twice as long as that for active-duty officers.
　　Question: Who confers the rank of Grand General?
　　Answer: Article 18, Paragraph 4 of the Regulations on the Service of Officers stipulates: "When a Senior Colonel, Major General, Lieutenant General, or General is promoted, the State Council orders the conferment." This means that when a General is promoted to Grand General, the State Council orders the conferment. Therefore, the rank of Grand General is also conferred by order of the State Council.
　　Question: What happens to the lives of officers who are transferred to the reserve or retired?
　　Answer: The Party and the state are very concerned about officers who are transferred to the reserve or retired. The government will make arrangements for their livelihood after they leave active service based on their specific circumstances. Those who have the ability to work can be assigned to government agencies, schools, organizations, factories, enterprises, or rural areas for employment; in order to take care of some of their difficulties when they first leave active service, the state also provides certain production subsidies and living allowances. Retired officers who are wounded or disabled in combat or on duty, and retired officers who have served in the army for a long time and have lost their ability to work, can also receive long-term support待遇 according to regulations. However, retired officers should not have the idea of simply relying on government subsidies. They must maintain and carry forward the spirit of hard work and overcoming difficulties of the People's Army. All those who have the ability to work should actively work hard and strive to build the socialist cause. Only with the continuous development of the national economy can individual lives be gradually improved.
　　Question: What are active-duty assigned officers? Do active-duty assigned officers include transferred cadres?
　　Answer: Active-duty assigned officers refer to active-duty officers who are sent by the Ministry of National Defense to non-military departments to perform military-related tasks in accordance with Article 39 of the Regulations on the Service of Officers. For example, active-duty officers sent to local universities to serve as military instructors are active-duty assigned officers.
　　Cadres who have been transferred (whether collectively or individually) are not active-duty assigned officers.

　　有关中国人民解放军军官服役条例的若干问题
    问：现役军官、预备役军官和退役军官之间的区别是什么？
    答：凡在中国人民解放军中服现役的少尉以上的军官（包括现役派遣军官），都是现役军官。没有在中国人民解放军中服现役的预备役军官，或者由现役转为预备役的军官，都是预备役军官；预备役军官有服现役的义务。现役军官和预备役军官在服满预备役的最高年龄或者因伤、病、残废而完全不能服现役的时候，即行退役，退役以后就是退役军官；退役军官不再服现役和预备役。
    问：军衔晋级为什么要规定一定的期限？预备役军官的军衔晋级期限为什么要比现役军官的军衔晋级期限延长一倍？
    答：军官的军事知识的提高和军事经验的积累，都需要一定的时间。不同军衔等级的军官提高军事知识和积累军事经验所需要的时间，长短又有所不同。为了使军衔晋级制度统一，所以对军官的军衔晋级需要规定一定的期限。由于预备役军官是在非军事部门服务，提高军事知识和积累军事经验不如现役军官快，为了使预备役军官和现役军官在质量上基本求得一致，所以预备役军官的军衔晋级期限就应该比现役军官的军衔晋级期限延长一倍。
    问：大将军衔由谁授予？
    答：军官服役条例第18条第4项规定：“大校、少将、中将、上将晋级时，由国务院命令授予。“这就是说，上将晋升大将的时候，是由国务院命令授予的。所以，大将军衔也是由国务院命令授予。
    问：军官转入预备役和退役以后的生活怎么办？
    答：对转入预备役和退役的军官，党和国家是十分关怀的。他们退出现役以后的生活问题，政府会根据他们本人的具体情况分别予以安置。有劳动能力和工作能力的人，可以分别安置到政府机关、学校团体、工厂企业或农村中就业；为了照顾他们刚退出现役时候的某些困难，国家还发给一定的生产资助金和生活补助金。在作战中或因公伤残的退役军官和在军队中服务时间很长而失去了劳动能力的退役军官，还可以按规定受到长期供养的待遇。但是，退出现役的军官，不应该有单纯依赖政府补助的思想，必须保持和发扬人民军队艰苦奋斗、克服困难的精神，凡是有劳动能力的，都应积极努力工作，为建设社会主义事业而奋斗。只有随着国家经济的日益发展，个人生活才能逐步得到提高。
    问：什么是现役派遣军官？现役派遣军官是否包括转业的干部？
    答：现役派遣军官，是指的依照军官服役条例第39条的规定，由国防部派往非军事部门担任军事性质工作任务的现役军官。例如派往地方高等学校担任军事教员的现役军官，就是现役派遣军官。
    转业（不论集体的或个别的）的干部，都不是现役派遣军官。
