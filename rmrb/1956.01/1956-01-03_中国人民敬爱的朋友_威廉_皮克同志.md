　　Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, a Dear Friend of the Chinese People
　　Wang Jiaxiang, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
　　January 3rd of this year marks the 80th birthday of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, the outstanding leader of the German working class and the German people, the outstanding activist in the international workers' movement, the leader of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and the President of the German Democratic Republic. With boundless respect, the Chinese people join the German people in warmly congratulating Comrade Pieck, a close friend of the Chinese people, on his birthday.
　　Comrade Pieck is a loyal son of the German working class. Born into a working-class family, he began his activities for the welfare and liberation of the working class from his youth. He joined the German trade unions and the German Social Democratic Party, studied the works of Marx and Engels, and became convinced that only the realization of socialism could liberate the working class and the working people from all oppression. This determined his life's path of struggle, which was a path of selfless struggle for the cause of liberation of the working class and the working people. Therefore, Comrade Pieck's life embodies and reflects all the activities and struggles of the German working people and the outstanding sons and daughters of Germany, and this activity and struggle has always been deeply admired by the Chinese working class and the world working class.
　　Before and during the First World War, Comrade Pieck, together with Liebknecht and Luxemburg, waged a resolute struggle to defend Marxism against the right-wing opportunism within the German Social Democratic Party at that time. Under very difficult conditions, they opposed the imperialist war of aggression, called on the people to overthrow militarism, and end the war.
　　The victory of the great Russian October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history. Under the influence of the Russian Revolution, the German working people revolted and launched the German Revolution of November 1918. During this German Revolution, Comrade Pieck carried out tremendous activities. The experience of the revolution showed that without a working-class party built on the principles of Leninism, it would be impossible to guide the working class onto the road to final victory. Thus, the outstanding representatives of the German working class launched activities to establish such a party. In December 1918, the Communist Party of Germany was proclaimed, and the comrades who created this party were Liebknecht, Luxemburg, and Pieck. Later, the Communist Party of Germany joined the Communist International led by Lenin and became one of its excellent branches. In 1928, Comrade Pieck participated in the leadership of the Communist International, making great contributions to the international workers' movement.
　　During the period of Hitler's rule in Germany and during the Second World War, the German people suffered the greatest disasters. The Communist Party of Germany also suffered the most serious persecution. The Communist Party of Germany waged the most arduous struggle to save Germany from crisis and to oppose fascist terror and new wars of aggression. Comrade Pieck repeatedly called on the German people to unite and use their own strength to overthrow Hitler's rule. Comrade Pieck and all the outstanding sons and daughters of Germany opposed Hitler's struggle under the most difficult conditions, which was deeply admired by the Chinese people, who were at that time engaged in a brutal struggle against the Japanese imperialists, allies of German fascism.
　　The Soviet Red Army's victory over Hitler's fascism opened up the possibility for the entire Germany to move towards a path of peace and democracy, and the Potsdam Agreement guaranteed that post-war Germany would become a unified democratic country.
　　After the war, Comrade Pieck led the German people in carrying out arduous work to establish a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. Democratic reforms were rapidly completed in eastern Germany, the foundations of the rule of the Junker landlords, monopoly capital, and militarism were destroyed, a solid alliance of the working class and working peasants was established, and the Communist Party of Germany and the German Social Democratic Party were unified on the basis of Leninism principles, establishing the new Socialist Unity Party of Germany, thereby restoring the unity of the German workers' movement and strengthening the strength and leadership of the working class.
　　In October 1949, almost simultaneously with the founding of the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Republic was proclaimed, and Comrade Pieck was elected as its first president. The appearance of this new worker-peasant state on German territory not only laid the foundation for a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, but also became a "turning point in European history." The People's Republic of China is very happy to have such a strong brotherly country.
　　Since then, the German Democratic Republic has continuously achieved great achievements in developing its economy, building socialism, and improving the people's living standards. The first five-year plan of the German Democratic Republic was completed in 1955, laying a solid economic foundation for the construction of socialism in the German Democratic Republic. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by this new achievement of the German people.
　　The German Democratic Republic is constantly striving to restore German unity and establish a peaceful, democratic, and independent Germany. However, the American ruling clique, disregarding the national interests of the German people, is actively reviving German militarism, deepening the division of Germany, attempting to turn West Germany into a new source of war, and vainly attempting to merge the German Democratic Republic into a re-militarized Germany. The Chinese people firmly oppose this plan of the American ruling clique, which threatens world peace, and fully support the German Democratic Republic's statement supporting the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a European collective security system, as well as its proposal to establish an all-German committee to unify Germany. Of course, the German people will encounter various obstacles in the process of striving to establish a unified, independent, democratic, and peaceful Germany, but the Chinese people are convinced that the German people's just demand for the restoration of German unity on a democratic basis will surely be realized. As everyone knows, after China was reduced to a semi-colonial country in the last century, the struggle of various imperialist countries for spheres of influence in China once caused China to be divided. The Chinese people deeply feel the pain of being divided and resolutely demand the realization of China's independence, liberation and unity. It was precisely relying on the strength of this just demand of the Chinese people that the Communist Party of China finally eliminated the imperialist forces and feudal separatist forces that had plunged China into division and completed the true people's unity that had never been seen in Chinese history. Although our Taiwan is still occupied by the United States, we are confident that it will definitely be recovered. It is precisely based on our own past experience that we have reason to believe that the power of the German people to demand the realization of unity will be great, and it will surely be victorious.
　　Since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the friendly relations between it and our country have been growing day by day. It is worth mentioning here that the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, was invited to visit China and signed the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Chinese government and issued a joint statement of the two governments. A delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Comrade Zhu De, has gone to Germany to participate in the celebration of Comrade Pieck's 80th birthday. These two friendly visits by the leaders of the two countries, especially the signing of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and the publication of the joint statement of the two governments, indicate that the relations between China and Germany have entered a new stage.
　　The Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation solemnly declares that, for the benefit of China and Germany, the two countries will strengthen and expand friendly relations in all aspects on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit; China and Germany will participate in international actions aimed at ensuring world peace and the security of all countries and peoples and in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter in the spirit of sincere cooperation; and, in the spirit of brotherly solidarity, will consult on all major international issues concerning the interests of the two countries to safeguard the interests of the two countries and consolidate world peace. Peace is indivisible, and the peace of Europe is closely linked to the peace of Asia. This mutual support between China and Germany will undoubtedly greatly strengthen the power of the two countries against imperialism and will help to consolidate the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The development of friendship between China and Germany will play an important role in maintaining world peace.
　　The treaty also stipulates that, for the benefit of the peaceful construction of the two countries, the two countries will continue to develop economic cooperation, conduct scientific and technological cooperation to contribute to the progress of science and technology, and expand cultural exchanges to enhance the friendship between the two countries. Now the Chinese people are struggling to complete the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy ahead of schedule. Our socialist industry has developed rapidly; the socialist transformation of agriculture has entered a climax, and agricultural collectivization will be basically realized throughout the country by this autumn; the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is also entering a new stage, and private industry and commerce are transforming into state capitalist economy on a large scale and throughout the industry. There is no doubt that the new economic, scientific and technological, and cultural cooperative relations between China and Germany will play an important role in the future development of our country's socialist construction. Similarly, it will also play an important role in the peaceful construction of the German Democratic Republic.
　　It is obvious that all the great achievements made by the German Democratic Republich since its establishment, and the ever-increasing unbreakable friendship between China and Germany, cannot be separated from the correct leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Comrade Pieck. On the occasion of Comrade Pieck's 80th birthday, the Chinese people warmly congratulate Comrade Pieck on his birthday. The Chinese people sincerely wish Comrade Pieck good health and longevity, and congratulate him and the German people on achieving greater success in the socialist cause of building the German Democratic Republic, in the struggle to achieve a unified, independent, democratic and peace-loving Germany, and in the activities to maintain European and world peace.

　　中国人民敬爱的朋友——威廉·皮克同志
    中国共产党中央委员会委员　王稼祥
    今年1月3日是德国工人阶级和德国人民的杰出领袖、国际工人运动的杰出的活动家、德国统一社会党领导者、德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克同志的80寿辰。中国人民怀着无限敬意，同德国人民一道，热烈地祝贺这一位中国人民的亲密朋友——皮克同志的寿辰。
    皮克同志是德国工人阶级的忠实的儿子。他出生在工人的家庭中，从青年时代起就开始了为工人阶级谋福利和谋解放的活动。他参加了德国工会和德国社会民主党，研究了马克思和恩格斯的著作，确信只有实现社会主义，才能把工人阶级和劳动人民从一切压迫下解放出来，这样就决定了他的一生的斗争道路，这就是为工人阶级和劳动人民的解放事业进行忘我斗争的道路。因此，皮克同志的一生，正是体现了和反映了德国劳动人民、德国优秀儿女的一切活动和斗争，而这种活动和斗争一向获得中国工人阶级和世界工人阶级深深的敬仰。
    在第一次世界大战以前和战争期间，皮克同志曾经同李卜克内西、卢森堡一起，为保卫马克思主义同当时德国社会民主党内的右倾机会主义展开了坚决的斗争。他们在非常困难的条件下反对帝国主义的侵略战争，号召人民推翻军国主义，结束战争。
    伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命的胜利，开辟了人类历史的新纪元。德国的劳动人民在俄国革命的影响下，举行起义，掀起了1918年11月德国革命。在这次德国革命中，皮克同志曾经进行了巨大的活动。革命的经验表明，没有一个建立在列宁主义原则基础上的工人阶级的政党，就不可能引导工人阶级走上最后胜利的道路，于是德国工人阶级的优秀代表，就为建立这样的一个党展开了活动。1918年12月，德国共产党宣告成立，创建这个党的，是李卜克内西、卢森堡和皮克等同志。以后，德国共产党参加了列宁所领导的共产国际，成为它的优秀的支部之一。1928年，皮克同志参加了共产国际的领导工作，给予国际工人运动以很大贡献。
    在希特勒统治德国期间和第二次世界大战期间，德国人民蒙受了最大的灾难。德国共产党也经受了最严重的迫害。德国共产党为拯救德国的危机，为反对法西斯恐怖和新的掠夺战争，曾进行了最艰苦的斗争。皮克同志一再号召德国人民团结起来，用自己的力量来推翻希特勒统治。皮克同志和所有德国优秀儿女在最困难的条件下反对希特勒的斗争，获得中国人民的深深敬仰，当时中国人民正同德国法西斯盟友日本帝国主义者进行着残酷的斗争。
    苏联红军战胜希特勒法西斯，为整个德国开辟了走向和平民主道路的可能性，波茨坦协定保障了战后德国将成为一个统一的民主国家。
    在战后，皮克同志领导德国人民为建立一个统一、独立、民主、爱好和平的德国进行了艰巨的工作。在德意志东部迅速地完成了民主改革，摧毁了容克地主、垄断资本和军国主义统治的根基，建立了工人阶级和劳动农民的巩固联盟，并在列宁主义的原则基础上统一了德国共产党和德国社会民主党，建立了新的德国统一社会党，从而恢复了德国工人运动的统一，加强了工人阶级的力量及其领导作用。
    1949年10月，差不多同中华人民共和国成立同时，德意志民主共和国宣告成立，皮克同志当选为第一任总统。这个新的工农国家在德意志领土上的出现，不但奠定了统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国的基础，而且成为“欧洲历史的转折点”。中华人民共和国以有了这样一个坚强的兄弟国家而感到十分高兴。
    此后，德意志民主共和国在发展经济、建设社会主义事业、提高人民生活水平方面，不断地取得了巨大的成就。德意志民主共和国的第一个五年计划已在1955年完成，它奠定了德意志民主共和国建设社会主义的稳固的经济基础。中国人民为德国人民所获得的这一新的成就而感到欢欣鼓舞。
    德意志民主共和国不断地为恢复德意志的统一，建立和平的、民主的、独立的德国而奋斗。然而美国统治集团不顾德国人民的民族利益，积极复活德国军国主义，加深分裂德国，企图把西德变成新的战争的策源地，并妄想把德意志民主共和国合并到重新军国主义化的德国中去。中国人民坚决反对美国统治集团的这一威胁世界和平的计划，完全拥护德意志民主共和国支持苏联所倡议的建立欧洲集体安全体系的声明，以及它的建立全德委员会以统一德国的主张。当然，德国人民在为争取建立统一、独立、民主、和平的德国的斗争过程中，是会遇到种种阻碍的，但是中国人民确信，德国人民要求在民主的基础上恢复德国统一的正义要求，是一定能够实现的。大家知道，中国从上一世纪沦为半殖民地国家以后，各国帝国主义争夺在华势力范围的斗争，曾经造成了中国的四分五裂。中国人民深深地感到这种被分裂的痛苦，而坚决地要求实现中国的独立解放与统一。中国共产党正是依靠了中国人民的这种正义要求的力量，终于扫除了陷中国于四分五裂的帝国主义势力和封建的割据势力，完成了中国历史上从未有过的真正的人民的统一。虽然现在我国的台湾还被美国霸占着，但是我们确信它是一定能够被收复的。正是根据我们自己的以往经验，我们有理由相信，德国人民要求实现统一的力量将是伟大的，它也是一定能够胜利的。
    自从德意志民主共和国成立以来，它同我国之间的友好关系与日俱增。这里值得特别指出的，是以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团应邀访问了中国，并同中国政府签订了中德友好合作条约和发表了两国政府的联合声明。中华人民共和国以朱德同志为首的代表团已前往德国，参加皮克同志80寿辰的祝贺。这两次中德两国国家领导人员的友好访问，特别是中德友好合作条约的签订和两国政府联合声明的发表，表明了中德两国的关系进入了新的阶段。
    中德友好合作条约庄严地宣告，为了中德两国的利益，在互相尊重主权、互不干涉内政和平等互利的基础上加强和扩大两国各方面的友好关系；中德两国本着真诚合作精神参加旨在保障世界和平和各国人民的安全并且符合联合国宪章原则的国际行动；并且本着兄弟的团结精神，就一切有关两国利益的重大国际问题进行磋商，以保障两国的利益和巩固世界和平。和平是不可分割的，欧洲的和平与亚洲的和平是密切地联系着的。中德两国的这种相互支持，无疑地将大大加强两个国家反对帝国主义的力量，将有助于巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量。中德两国友谊的发展对于维护世界和平将起重要的作用。
    条约还规定了为了两国和平建设的利益，将继续发展两国之间的经济合作，为了有助于科学和科学技术的进步，将进行科学和科学技术的合作，为了增进两国的友谊，将扩大文化交流。现在中国人民正在为提早完成发展国民经济的第一个五年计划进行着斗争。我国的社会主义工业已有了迅速的发展；农业的社会主义改造已经进入高潮，到今年秋季将基本上实现全国农业合作化，资本主义工商业的改造也同样地进入了新的阶段，私营工商业正大批地、全行业地转变为国家资本主义经济。毫无疑问，中德两国新的经济的、科学与科学技术的、文化的合作关系，对于我国社会主义建设的今后发展，将起重要的作用。同样，它对于德意志民主共和国的和平建设，也将起重要的作用。
    显而易见，德意志民主共和国成立以来所取得的一切伟大成果、以及中德两国牢不可破的友谊的日益增进，是同德国统一社会党和皮克同志的正确的领导分不开的。当皮克同志80寿辰的时候，中国人民十分热烈地祝贺皮克同志的寿辰。中国人民衷心地祝贺皮克同志的健康长寿，祝贺他和德国人民在建设德意志民主共和国的社会主义事业中，在为实现统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国的斗争中，以及在维护欧洲和世界和平的活动中，取得更大的成就。
