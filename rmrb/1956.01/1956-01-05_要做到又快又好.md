　　To Be Both Fast and Good
　　Gu Ye
    In 1955, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory undertook the task of producing five single-bucket loaders. This was a new product copied from Soviet product samples. Because it was copied, there was no guarantee that the drawings were completely correct. Therefore, although only five units were to be produced, a trial production was necessary to identify and correct errors before mass production could begin.
    Initially, the factory also planned to follow this procedure. However, the factory's tasks later increased, and the leaders saw that if they continued to do things in such a formal way, it would be difficult to complete the task of producing five single-bucket loaders before the end of 1955. So they changed their minds and, without waiting for the first sample to be successfully trial-produced, they put all the materials for the remaining single-bucket loaders into production. They knew very well that doing so was very dangerous. If a part went wrong in the future, five parts would need to be reworked, and unexpected problems might also occur. However, in order to strive to complete the task of producing five single-bucket loaders within the year, they still chose this dangerous path regardless. As a result, as of January 3 this year, not even one of the five single-bucket loaders had been assembled.
    It is imperative to complete the state's plan on schedule. This determination and spirit are what our country currently needs in order to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. However, to achieve this goal, methods that violate scientific and production procedures cannot be adopted. Because doing so can easily, or even certainly, lead to problems such as poor quality and chaotic management, not only causing waste, but also thwarting the original intention of being "fast."
    Currently, the workers on the industrial front are working with high enthusiasm, wholeheartedly wanting to complete and overfulfill the state's first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Enterprise leaders should cherish this enthusiasm of the workers and provide correct leadership. In such times, without correct leadership, deviations that violate scientific and production procedures are more likely to occur. In the trial production of new products and in basic construction, there have already been one-sided statements such as "in order to strive for speed, procedures can be disregarded." Of course, individual, conditional, and assured tasks, after thorough research and with the approval of higher authorities, can also omit certain procedures. However, this does not mean that the method of violating procedures and laws can be universally adopted to strive for speed. The correct approach should be: under the premise of complying with procedures and laws, strive to shorten the time of each link and each step. This is certainly much more difficult than skipping the entire stage. However, the cause of China's industrialization, which is to be carried out "more, faster, better, and more economically," can only rely on heroic acts that are not afraid of any difficulties, and should not just hope to take the path with the least trouble, as such a path is actually impassable.

　　要做到又快又好
　　顾页
    太原矿山机器厂1955年承担了生产五台单斗装载机的任务。这是一种按照苏联的产品实样测绘的新产品。因为是测绘的，图纸是不是完全正确就没有把握。因此，虽然一共只生产五台，也必须先试制，发现和修正错误以后，才能成批生产。
    起初，这个工厂也计划按照这样的步骤去做。但是，后来工厂的任务增加了，领导人员看见如果继续这样正规地做下去，在1955年年底以前就很难完成五台单斗装载机的任务。于是他们就改变了主意，没等第一台样品试制成功，就把其余几台单斗装载机的材料全部投入了生产。他们明明知道，这样做是很危险的。将来如果有一个零件发生毛病，就有五个零件需要返工，而且还可能发生预计不到的问题。可是，为了争取年内完成生产五台单斗装载机的任务，他们仍然不顾一切地选择了这条危险的道路。结果，到今年1月3日，这五台单斗装载机，连一台也没有装出来。
    无论如何要按期完成国家的计划。这种决心，这种精神，是目前我们的国家为了提早完成第一个五年计划所需要的。但是，为了达到这个目的，不能采取违反科学和生产程序的方法。因为这样做，就很容易、甚至必定会产生质量不好、管理混乱等毛病，不但造成浪费，而且连原来打算“快”的目的都要落空。
    现在，工业战线上的职工们正以高涨的热情，一心想提早完成和超额完成国家的第一个五年计划。企业的领导人应该十分爱护职工的这种热情，并且正确地加以领导。在这种时候，如果没有正确的领导，就更容易发生违反科学和生产程序的偏向。在试制新产品的工作中间，在基本建设中间，都已经出现了“为了争取速度，可以不遵守程序”等片面说法。当然，个别的、有条件的、有把握的工作，经过缜密的研究，经过上级的批准，也可以减略掉某些程序。但是，这不等于说可以普遍地采取违反程序和规律的办法来争取速度。正确的做法应该是：在遵守程序和规律的前提下，努力缩短每一个环节、每一个步骤的时间。这当然要比跳越整个阶段困难得多。但是，“又多、又快、又好、又省”地进行我国工业化的事业，只能依靠不怕任何困难的英雄行为，而不应只希望走麻烦最少的路，这样的路实际上也是走不通的。
