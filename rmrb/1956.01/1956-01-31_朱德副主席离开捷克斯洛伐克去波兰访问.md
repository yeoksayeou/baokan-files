On behalf of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Republic's government, Prime Minister Široký and Comrade Novotný presented Vice Chairman Zhu De with a complete set of machinery and equipment needed for a state-owned farm as a gift to the Chinese people.

On the afternoon of the 29th, Cao Ying, the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to Czechoslovakia, and his wife held a grand banquet to celebrate Vice Chairman Zhu De's visit to Czechoslovakia.

During the banquet, Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a speech. He said that the Czechoslovak people are not only a heroic shock force in building socialism, but also heroic fighters for maintaining international peace. The achievements of the recently concluded Prague meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states once again vividly demonstrated the firm stance taken by the Czechoslovak Republic, together with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, in maintaining international peace and striving for the realization of a European collective security system. The Chinese people and government wholeheartedly support the various proposals outlined in the declaration of this meeting and are willing to work with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other people's democratic countries to realize these proposals.

Vice Chairman Zhu De expressed his gratitude to the Czechoslovak Communist Party and government for presenting the Chinese people with a complete set of modern state-owned farm machinery and equipment, saying that this is the support of the fraternal Czechoslovak people for the socialist transformation of agriculture in China.

President Zápotocký then delivered a speech. He said, "I believe that Vice Chairman Zhu De's visit has deepened the friendship between us and China, this great country, and has also convinced our dear guests of the warm sympathy that the Czechoslovak people have for the Chinese people."

He said, "All our delegations that have visited the People's Republic of China are convinced that People's China is a country with unlimited potential, where hundreds of millions of liberated people are building a new socialist life. We are proud that the Czechoslovak people can make a modest contribution to this construction."

On the evening of the 29th, Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, accompanied by Marshal Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council of the People's Republic of China, and Liu Lantao, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, left Prague by special train for Warsaw.

Present at the station to see them off were Prime Minister Široký, Antonín Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, as well as other leaders of the Party and government, senior generals of the Czechoslovak Army, heads of various people's organizations, and thousands of residents of Prague.

Vice Chairman Zhu De, accompanied by the Chief of General Staff of the Czechoslovak Army, Kratochvíl, reviewed the guard of honor.

Prime Minister Široký delivered a farewell speech. He pointed out that Vice Chairman Zhu De's visit is another proof of the fraternal friendship and cooperation between Czechoslovakia and China.

Prime Minister Široký finally asked Vice Chairman Zhu De to convey the warmest respects of all the Czechoslovak people to the Chinese people, the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the government, and the beloved Comrade Mao Zedong.

Vice Chairman Zhu De then delivered a farewell speech. In his speech, he spoke of the brilliant achievements made by the Czechoslovak working people in building a happy socialist life, as well as the deep fraternal friendship of the Czechoslovak people for the Chinese people. Vice Chairman Zhu De conveyed the heartfelt respect and wishes of the Chinese people to the fraternal Czechoslovak people, and wished the Czechoslovak people greater achievements in the struggle to build socialism and safeguard European and world peace. Vice Chairman Zhu De particularly pointed out: The achievements of the Prague meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states and the declaration it issued will undoubtedly make a great contribution to world security and peace. The Chinese people and government wholeheartedly support the decisions of this meeting and the various proposals outlined in the declaration, and are willing to work with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries to realize these proposals.

Their speeches were repeatedly interrupted by prolonged and enthusiastic applause from the send-off crowd, who cheered "Long live Mao Zedong," "Long live People's China," and "Long live peace."

Subsequently, Vice Chairman Zhu De shook hands with the Czechoslovak Party and government leaders one by one to bid farewell.
