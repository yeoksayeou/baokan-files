    Soviet People Welcome the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
    On Hydroelectric Power Station Construction Sites
    At the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station on the Angara River, a socialist emulation drive to welcome the 20th Party Congress is in full swing.  Minus 40-degree Celsius temperatures and dense fog, day after day, envelop the entire construction site, but the construction workers have not retreated in the face of these difficulties. On the snow-covered, undulating banks of the river, the rumble of excavators, bulldozers, and huge dump trucks never ceases.  All the construction workers are determined to get the first two sets of generator units producing electricity this year.
    Labor Upsurge in Rural Areas
    In the rural areas of Altai, a warm competition is being launched to welcome the 20th Party Congress.  Across the entire region, 20 Machine Tractor Stations have completed their tractor repair plans for spring plowing. The new inhabitants on the wasteland have also enthusiastically joined the competition. State farms such as "Kalinin," "May First," and "Sharchinsky" have completed preparations for spring land reclamation. All collective farms and state farms in the region have put forward new guarantees.  The "Sverdlov" Collective Farm guarantees to double the planting of corn. Livestock breeders in the Soloneshen district guarantee that before February 14, all collective farms in the region will average 800 kilograms of milk from each cow, while state farms will reach 1,100 kilograms.  Agricultural laborers in the Altai region have decided that this year's grain production should increase by 140 million poods compared to the region's highest yield.
    Initiative of Agricultural Machinery Operators
    Tractor drivers, tractor team leaders, repair workers, and engineering technicians from the Machine Tractor Stations and state farms in the Voronezh region issued a written appeal to all agricultural machinery operators across the Soviet Union, calling on them to welcome the 20th Party Congress with new labor achievements. Their own guarantee conditions are: to repair all tractors before the opening of the 20th Party Congress, and to ensure the excellent quality of all machines, reducing repair costs. From January to March, each Machine Tractor Station and state farm will organize technical studies for workers to improve their technical level.
    Publishing Houses to Release a Large Number of Books
    To welcome the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet publishing industry is preparing to publish a large number of books. The State Political Books Publishing House will publish two collections of Lenin's essays compiled by the Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin Institute - "On the Development of Heavy Industry" and "On Labor Productivity." An index to the fourth edition of Lenin's Collected Works will be published in February, which will greatly facilitate readers who study Lenin's works independently. In February, Volume 4 of the Complete Works of Marx and Engels and Volume 14 of the Complete Works of Stalin (including works from 1934 to the beginning of 1940) will also be published. Preparations are underway to publish Marx and Engels' "Collection of Early Works," which are not included in the Complete Works. A new political dictionary will also be published. Before the Congress, two volumes of the most complete "Memoirs of Lenin" and "Memoirs of Marx and Engels" will be published. Compilations of materials from the Second Session of the First National People's Congress of China are also being prepared for publication.

    苏联人民迎接苏联共产党第二十次代表大会
    在水电站建筑工地上
    在安加拉河畔的伊尔库次克水电站，为迎接第二十次党代会的社会主义竞赛正在蓬勃开展着。零下40度的严寒侵袭着整个工地，浓雾终日笼罩着两岸，但是建筑工人们在困难面前并没有后退。在那盖着厚雪的岗陵起伏的河岸上，掘土机、铲土机、巨大的自卸卡车的轰隆声不断地响着。全体建筑工人下定决心，要在今年使第一批两台联动机开始发电。
    农村中的劳动高潮
    在阿尔泰的农村中，正在热烈展开迎接第二十次党代会的竞赛。整个边疆区有20个机器拖拉机站完成了春耕前的拖拉机修理计划。荒地上的新居民也热烈地参加了竞赛。“加里宁斯基”，“五一”，“沙尔钦斯基”等国营农场已经完成了春季垦荒的准备工作。全区所有的集体农庄和国营农场都提出了新的保证。“斯维尔德洛夫”集体农庄保证把玉蜀黍的播种扩大一倍。索洛涅申区的养畜者保证，在2月14日以前全区所有的集体农庄平均从每头牛那里得到800公斤牛奶，而国营农场则要达到1，100公斤。阿尔泰边疆区的农业劳动者决定，今年生产的谷物要比本区最高产量增多1.4亿普特。
    农业机器操使者的倡议
    沃龙涅什州机器拖拉机站和国营农场的拖拉机手、拖拉机工作队队长、修理工人和工程技术人员向全苏联的农业机器操使者发表了书面号召，号召以新的劳动成就迎接第二十次党代会。他们自己的保证条件是：在第二十次党代会开幕前修理好所有的拖拉机，并保证所有机器的优良质量，降低修理成本。从1月到3月间每个机器拖拉机站和国营农场都组织工人们的技术学习，以提高他们的技术水平。
    出版界将出大批书籍
    苏联出版界为了迎接苏共第二十次代表大会，准备出版大批书籍。国家政治书籍出版社将出版马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学院编的两本列宁的论文集——“论发展重工业”和“论劳动生产率”。列宁全集第四版索引将于2月出版，它将给自修列宁著作的读者极大方便。在2月也将出版马克思、恩格斯全集第4卷和斯大林全集第14卷（包括1934年到1940年初的作品）。准备出版马克思和恩格斯的“早期作品集”，这些作品没有收在全集内。也将出版新的政治辞典。在代表大会之前将出版两卷最全的“列宁回忆录”和“马克思和恩格斯回忆录”。也准备出版中国第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议材料汇编。
