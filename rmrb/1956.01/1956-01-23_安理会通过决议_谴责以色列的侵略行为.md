Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS, Moscow—The United Nations Security Council concluded its meeting on the 19th, discussing Syria’s complaint regarding the aggression by Israeli armed forces in the Lake Tiberias area of Syrian territory on the night of December 11 and 12, 1955. The meeting unanimously passed a revised proposal from the United States, Britain, and France, which condemned Israel's acts of aggression. The proposal requires the Israeli government to fulfill these obligations in the future. However, the proposal did not specify what concrete measures the Security Council would take in the event of another similar armed aggression by Israel.

    Soviet representative Sobolev, in explaining his vote, said that the Soviet delegation voted in favor of the proposal because, although the proposal has shortcomings in preventing the Israeli armed forces from re-invading the territory of Arab countries in the future, it severely criticized Israel's unfounded armed aggression against Syrian territory. The facts listed in the statements of some members of the Security Council and the report of the Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization extremely clearly prove that the Israeli armed forces invaded Syrian territory, and Syria became the victim of this act of aggression. Sobolev reminded the Israeli government that it should take the warnings made by the Security Council meeting very seriously and take all necessary measures to end the provocative acts on the Israeli-Arab border. If Israel does not fulfill its obligations, the Security Council will have to consider the question of what necessary further measures to take under the Charter to maintain and restore peace.

### 安理会通过决议  谴责以色列的侵略行为

    安理会通过决议
    谴责以色列的侵略行为
    新华社据塔斯社讯　联合国安全理事会19日会议结束了叙利亚就以色列武装部队在1955年12月11、12日夜间侵犯叙利亚领土太比利亚湖地区而提出的控诉案的讨论。会议一致通过了经过修正的美、英、法三国提案，这一提案谴责以色列的侵犯行为。提案要求以色列政府今后履行这些义务。不过提案中没有指出，一旦以色列再犯类似的武装侵犯的行为，安全理事会将采取怎样的具体措施。
    苏联代表索波列夫在说明投票理由的时候说，苏联代表团投票赞成这个提案是因为：虽然这个提案在制止以色列武装部队将来重新侵犯阿拉伯国家的领土这方面是有缺点的，但是它严厉指责了以色列对叙利亚领土的毫无根据的武装侵犯的行为。安全理事会一些理事的发言所列举的事实以及联合国停战协定监督委员会参谋长的报告都极其清楚地证明了这样一点，就是以色列的武装部队侵犯了叙利亚的领土，叙利亚成了这一侵略行动的牺牲者。索波列夫提醒以色列政府注意，它应当十分郑重地对待安全理事会会议所作的警告，采取一切必要的措施来终止在以色列—阿拉伯边境线上的挑衅行为。如果以色列不履行它的义务，安全理事会就不得不考虑这样的问题：按照宪章采取什么必要的进一步的措施以维护和恢复和平。
