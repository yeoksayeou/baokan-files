    "Freedom of the Press" in the United States
    American progressive writer Alvah Bessie, under persecution from the American authorities, has had to take refuge in Mexico in recent years. Recently, he completed a novel exposing the dark social system of the United States, "The Long Day in a Short Life," but it cannot be published in the United States.
    Alvah Bessie has already sent the manuscript of this novel to Xiao San, a director of the Chinese Writers Association. In his letter to Xiao San, he said, "Due to the situation in America, which you are clearly aware of, it is somewhat problematic for a writer like me to find publishing opportunities now." He also said, "The publisher who has published my works for many years is now unwilling to continue including me on his list of writers."
    It is reported that the Chinese Writers Association has handed this manuscript over to the National Literary Publishing Authority, and it is currently being translated. It will be available to readers in the second half of this year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    “出版自由”在美国
    美国进步作家艾·马尔兹，在美国当局的迫害下，近年来不得不避居在墨西哥。最近，他完成了一部揭露美国黑暗的社会制度的长篇小说“短促生命中漫长的一天”，但是不能在美国出版。
    艾·马尔兹已经把这部长篇小说的原稿寄给我国作家协会理事萧三。他在给萧三的信中说：“由于你已经清楚地知道的美国的那些情况，像我这样的作家，现在要找到出版机会是有些问题的。”他还说：“多年来出版我的作品的那个出版商现在不愿继续把我列在他的作家的名单上了。”
    据悉，中国作家协会已经把这个原稿交给国家文学出版机关，现正在翻译中，它将在今年下半年和读者见面。　（据新华社讯）
