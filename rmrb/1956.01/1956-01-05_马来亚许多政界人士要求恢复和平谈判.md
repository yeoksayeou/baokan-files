Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, January 4th: According to newspaper reports, many political figures in Malaya are demanding the resumption of peace talks in order to end the Malayan Emergency.

    Hoo Yew Wah, a member of the Legislative Council of the Federation of Malaya, said that although the recently concluded Baling Talks did not produce any results, he hoped that peace talks could be held again on the principle of mutual concessions in order to end the Malayan Emergency.

    Lim Chin Siong, a member of the Singapore Legislative Assembly, said that the demands put forward by the Malayan Communist Party in these peace talks showed that the Malayan Communist Party was sincere in ending the war. If the Malayan government truly intended to act in the interests of the people, there would be no reason why it could not work together with the Malayan Communist Party. Lim Chin Siong also said: These negotiations have not broken down, and he hopes that genuine peace can be achieved in 1956.

    Tan Tuan Boon, chairman of the Selangor branch of the Malayan Labour Party, said that Rahman went to Baling with his hands tied, so the negotiations did not produce any results. He also said that not recognizing the Malayan Communist Party is disrespecting the public will.

    Tan Yong Woo, chairman of the Singapore Democratic Party, Lim Koon Teck and Lee Choon Eng, members of the Singapore Legislative Assembly, and Tan Kim Tee, secretary-general of the Singapore Progressive Party, also made statements calling for a second round of peace talks to be held as soon as possible in order to end the Malayan Emergency through negotiations.

　　马来亚许多政界人士要求恢复和平谈判
    新华社4日讯　新加坡消息：据报纸报道，马来亚许多政界人士要求恢复和平谈判，以便结束马来亚战争。
    马来亚联合邦立法议员胡家濂说，不久前结束的华冷谈判虽然没有结果，但是，希望在双方让步的原则下再次举行和平谈判，以结束马来亚的战争。
    新加坡立法议员林清祥说，在这次和平谈判中，马来亚共产党提出的要求表明马来亚共产党是有诚意结束战争的。马来亚政府如果真正为人民利益打算，是没有理由不能和马来亚共产党共同努力的。林清祥又说：这次谈判并没有破裂，希望在1956年能够实现真正的和平。
    马来亚劳工党雪兰莪支部主席陈传文说，拉赫曼是绑着双手到华冷去的，因此谈判没有结果。他又说，不承认马来亚共产党就是不尊重人民的公意。
    新加坡民主党总裁陈永裕、新加坡立法议员林坤德和李俊英以及新加坡进步党秘书长陈锦池也发表谈话，要求尽早举行第二次和平谈判，以便通过谈判来结束马来亚的战争。
