　　Sudan

　　Sudan is located in northeastern Africa, south of Egypt. Most of the country is flat, with the Nile River running through it. It is surrounded by deserts, with highlands in the southwest. The country has a land area of over 2.5 million square kilometers and a population of approximately nine million. The capital is Khartoum.

　　For a considerable period of history, Sudan was a territory of Egypt. After Britain occupied Egypt in 1882, it forced Egypt to sign an agreement in 1899 on the Anglo-Egyptian “condominium” over Sudan. In 1924, Britain used a pretext to declare its sole “administration” of Sudan. The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 stipulated the restoration of the “condominium” over Sudan. In reality, since 1899, Britain had controlled Sudan's internal affairs, military, and legislative powers, turning Sudan into its colony.

　　Under more than 50 years of colonial rule by British colonialists, Sudan's economic lifeline was controlled by British monopoly capitalists, making it a cotton plantation for Britain. 37% of Sudan's territory is forest land, and it produces 80% to 85% of the world's gum arabic. However, imperialism and foreign companies controlled Sudan's foreign trade and 89% of the country's arable land. As a result, the Sudanese people lived in extreme poverty.

　　The Sudanese people have been fighting against colonialism for their survival and freedom. Especially after World War II, the people of Egypt and Sudan jointly launched a resolute struggle demanding the withdrawal of British troops from the Suez Canal Zone. In 1951, the national independence movement of the Sudanese people experienced new developments, giving rise to the "Front for Unified Liberation of Sudan." In December 1953, representatives from various strata of the Sudanese people held a National Congress for the Protection of Civil Rights and established a standing committee to carry out a movement to defend trade unions and civil rights. Sudanese farmers, with the strong support of Sudanese workers, also took action to oppose predatory rents and fight for the right to organize farmers' associations.

　　In October 1951, Egypt announced the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and also announced the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian “condominium” decree of 1899 regarding Sudan. In 1952, Britain and Egypt held multiple negotiations on the Sudan issue. In February 1953, Britain and Egypt reached a new agreement on the Sudan issue. The agreement stipulated that during a "transitional period" of no more than three years, Sudan would have the right to self-determination, to declare complete independence, or to merge with other countries. In December of the same year, the Sudanese parliament held its first historical election. In January 1954, the Sudanese autonomous government was declared established. In August 1955, Britain and Egypt agreed that the troops of both countries would be completely withdrawn from Sudan before November 13. After the withdrawal of troops, an international committee composed of neutral countries would supervise the election of Sudan's constituent assembly, and this assembly would organize a plebiscite to determine the future status of Sudan. On December 18, an agreement was reached between the various political parties in Sudan, deciding to send a letter to the British Governor-General of Sudan, asking him to find a way for the former condominium powers, Britain and Egypt, to immediately recognize the independence of Sudan.

　　苏丹
    苏丹位于非洲东北部，在埃及的南面。全国大部分是平地，尼罗河流贯全境，四周被沙漠围绕着，西南面是高地。在250万余平方公里的国土上，约有九百万的居民。首都是喀土穆。
    在相当长的历史时期中，苏丹是埃及的属地。1882年英国占领埃及以后，1899年又强迫埃及缔结关于英埃“共管”苏丹的协定。1924年英国借故宣布单独“管理”苏丹。1936年英埃条约规定恢复“共管”苏丹。实际上，自1899年以后，英国便控制了苏丹的内政、军事和立法权，把苏丹变为它的殖民地。
    在英国殖民者50多年的殖民统治下，苏丹的经济命脉为英国垄断资本家所控制，成为英国的棉花种植场。苏丹全境的37％是森林地，并生产占世界80％到85％的阿拉伯橡胶。但是帝国主义和外国公司控制了苏丹的对外贸易和苏丹全国可耕地的89％。因此苏丹人民生活非常贫困。
    苏丹人民为了自己的生存和自由，一直在为反对殖民主义而斗争。特别是第二次世界大战以后，埃及和苏丹人民一起展开了要求英军撤出苏彝士运河区的坚决斗争。1951年，苏丹人民的民族独立运动有了新发展，产生了“争取苏丹统一解放战线”。1953年12月，苏丹广大阶层的人民代表举行了全国保护公民权利代表大会，并设立了一个常设委员会，以开展保卫工会和公民权利的运动。苏丹的农民在苏丹工人有力的支持下也行动起来，为反对掠夺性的地租、争取组织农会的权利而斗争。
    1951年10月，埃及宣布废除1936年英埃条约，同时并宣布废除1899年英埃“共管”苏丹的法令。1952年，英埃就苏丹问题进行了多次谈判。1953年2月，英埃达成了关于苏丹问题的新协定。协定规定在不超过三年的“过渡时期”内，苏丹有自决权，宣布完全独立或与其他国家合并。同年12月，苏丹议会举行了历史上的第一次选举。1954年1月，苏丹自治政府宣告成立。1955年8月，英埃两国商定，在11月13日以前两国军队全部撤出苏丹。军队撤完后，由中立国组成的国际委员会来监督苏丹制宪议会的选举，并由这个议会组织公民投票来决定苏丹将来的地位。12月18日，苏丹各政党间取得协议，决定致函英国驻苏丹总督，要他设法使前共管国、英国和埃及立即承认苏丹的独立。（厚）
