The Central Committee for the Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis Scientific Research Committee has included the use of traditional Chinese medicine *Lobelia chinensis*, *Euphorbia humifusa*, and gourd-caterpillar fungus (*hulu-chongsun*) in treating late-stage schistosomiasis in the schistosomiasis treatment manual, providing it to schistosomiasis medical institutions in various regions for further research and application.

Last year, Anqing Prefectural Hospital in Anhui Province used *Lobelia chinensis* (commonly known as fine rice grass) to treat 40 patients with late-stage schistosomiasis with ascites. Except for one person who died due to severe illness and two people who showed little change, the ascites of the remaining 37 people were significantly reduced, their appetite and physical strength increased, and their condition improved. Among them, 8 people have already participated in labor production.

The effect of *Euphorbia humifusa* tested by the Changshan County Health Center in Zhejiang Province was also very significant. After 9 to 10 days of treatment, 21 of the 39 late-stage patients had their ascites eliminated, and their spleen and liver shrunk, and their complexion became ruddy. Stool tests were also negative.

The Wuxi Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Institute in Jiangsu Province used gourd-caterpillar fungus (*hulu-chongsun*) to treat 23 late-stage ascites patients. So far, except for 6 patients who have not improved, the ascites symptoms of the remaining 17 patients have been alleviated, and symptoms such as lower extremity edema have also disappeared.

Lv Tongyou, a porter from Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, used his ancestral secret recipe "Dragon Tiger Grass" to treat sixty to seventy late-stage schistosomiasis patients. After treatment, the patients' ascites symptoms disappeared significantly, and most people gradually recovered their health. After being treated with Dragon Tiger Grass, patient Bian Jinlai underwent continuous hospital tests 3 times, and no schistosomiasis eggs were found. Now, the Yangzhou Special District Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Institute has hired Lv Tongyou as a doctor to conduct further clinical trials.

    中药半边莲、腹水草等治疗晚期血吸虫病有效
    中央防治血吸虫病科学研究委员会把中药半边莲、腹水草和葫芦——虫笋治疗晚期血吸虫病的方法编入了血吸虫病治疗手册，提供各地血吸虫病医疗机构作进一步研究和应用。
    安徽省安庆专署医院在去年用半边莲（俗称细米草）治疗了40个血吸虫病晚期腹水病人。除了一人因病重死亡和两人变化不大以外，其余37人腹水显著减轻，食欲和体力增加，病情好转，其中有8人已参加了劳动生产。
    腹水草在浙江省常山县卫生院试用的效果也很显著。39个晚期病人经过9天到10天治疗，有21人腹水消除，脾脏、肝脏缩小，面色红润。检验大便也都是阴性反应。
    江苏省无锡血吸虫病防治所用葫芦——虫笋治疗的23个晚期腹水病人，到目前为止除了6个病人没有进步外，其余17个病人腹水症状减轻，下肢浮肿等症状也已经消失。（据新华社讯）
    江苏省江都县搬运工人吕同友用祖传秘方“龙虎草”治疗了六、七十个晚期血吸虫病患者。病人经治疗后腹水症状显著消失，大多数人身体逐渐恢复健康。病人卞进来用龙虎草治疗后，经医院连续化验3次，都没有发现血吸虫卵。现在，扬州专区血吸虫病防治所已聘请吕同友担任医生，作进一步的临床试验。
