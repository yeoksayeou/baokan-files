    People of Beijing, Tianjin, Hubei, Hunan, and Zhejiang Warmly Welcome the Publication of the Draft National Agricultural Development Program
    (Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports that people from all walks of life in the capital warmly cheer the publication of the Draft National Agricultural Development Program for 1956 to 1967 and pledge to thoroughly implement this great plan.

    Li Fengming of the Balizhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative said after reading the newspaper carrying the Draft National Agricultural Development Program: "I feel even clearer in my heart. This is a bright light that the Party has lit for the farmers." This agricultural production cooperative has decided to more than double the area of vegetable fields compared to the original plan. Employees of state-owned farms held separate symposiums, expressing their intention to play a demonstrative role in the implementation of this great plan.

    The workers of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory organized reading groups or held symposiums. The double-wheeled double-shared plow workshop decided to increase the output target for the February production plan by one times that of January.

    People from the capital's scientific and educational circles have expressed their willingness to contribute all their strength to thoroughly implement this program. Du Chunpei, associate researcher at the North China Agricultural Science Institute, said that he must work hard to study agricultural science and technically guarantee the continuous increase in agricultural production.

    (Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports that after the publication of the Draft National Agricultural Development Program for 1956 to 1967, people from all walks of life in Tianjin were greatly encouraged and unanimously expressed their warm support.

    On the morning of the 26th, at the mobilization meeting for launching a large-scale production campaign in the western suburbs, the draft program published in the newspaper was read out. The whole venue immediately resounded with cheers of "Long live the Communist Party!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" Meng Fanqi, director of the "Worker-Peasant Alliance" advanced cooperative, which has more than 1,300 farm households, said: "If these 40 articles are realized, our country will definitely become more prosperous and strong, and our farmers will become rich in every family. Now that our suburbs have achieved complete socialist agricultural cooperation, we have even more confidence in realizing this program."

    Yang Zhantian, a lathe worker at the Tianjin Tractor Factory, happened to receive the glorious task of processing the first casting for a tractor on the 26th. After seeing this draft program, he worked even harder. By 5 pm, he had already finished two sleeves, and their quality was up to standard.

    (Our Wuhan Newspaper, 27th) Farmers, workers, and people from all walks of life in Hubei Province and Wuhan City, after reading the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) in the newspaper, unanimously expressed their determination to strive to fully implement the tasks stipulated in the Program (Draft).

    Song Dafa, director of the Lighthouse No. 2 Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongting Township, a suburb of Wuhan, said that this program (draft) is also a guide for building a new socialist countryside. We must produce more vegetables and non-staple foods to meet the needs of the city's people.

    Zhu Yuehan, a forger in the third work section of the fourth workshop of the Hubei Provincial Farm Tool Factory, said excitedly after reading Article 11 of the Program (Draft): "I must find ways to improve the forging machine and increase production efficiency, and cooperate with the factory workers to manufacture more double-wheeled double-shared plows to support our farmer brothers."

    More than 30 principal leaders and people from all walks of life from the democratic parties and people's organizations in Hubei Province held a symposium on the afternoon of the 27th. Those who attended the symposium unanimously expressed: Realizing the tasks stipulated in the Program (Draft) is the glorious responsibility that everyone should fulfill in socialist construction.

    (Our Changsha Newspaper, 27th) The "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956 to 1967" proposed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people in Hunan Province to build socialism. Many county-level agricultural labor model conferences and three-level cadre meetings that are currently being held are conveying this inspiring and important document. Everyone is rejoicing and expressing their determination to strive to implement this program. Changsha County, with 180 townships and more than 700 agricultural production cooperatives, is determined to achieve "abundant production on every field and a thousand catties per mu" this year. The counties in the Changde Prefecture on the shores of Dongting Lake will create two thousand-catty-per-mu production counties and more than 4,000 thousand-catty-per-mu production cooperatives this year, increasing the total rice output of the prefecture by 23% compared to last year.

    (Our Hangzhou Newspaper, 27th) The broad masses of the people in Zhejiang Province were greatly encouraged after seeing the Draft National Agricultural Development Program. The 107 agricultural production cooperatives in Jianqiao District, Hangzhou, immediately revised the production increase plan for the 40,720 mu of ramie fields, striving to increase the ramie yield from 700 jin per mu in 1955 to 1,000 jin per mu in 1958. Members of the Shishannong Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Yin County had a heated discussion. The entire cooperative formulated this year's production increase targets. It is planned to convert 500 mu of rice fields to double-cropping rice, so that the yield per mu will reach 1,233 jin, an increase of 9.8% compared to last year. After this Program (Draft) was transmitted to the Hangzhou No. 1 Joint State-Private Cotton Textile Factory, the workers in the factory's repair shop decided to use waste materials to manufacture sprayers and other equipment to support agricultural production.
