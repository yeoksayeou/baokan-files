Demanding Relatives from the American Government
—Letters from Zhang Shoulian and Li Hong's Fathers—
Editor's Note: After this newspaper published letters from the families of seven students studying in the United States, the U.S. Immigration Bureau continued to deny that "no Chinese is not free" to return home. Now we are publishing letters from the fathers of two more students studying in the United States. The U.S. government has a responsibility to keep its word and allow their sons to return home.

Letter from Zhang Shoulian's Father

My son, Zhang Shoulian, graduated from the Physics Department of the Tsinghua University Research Institute. He went to the United States to study in 1944 and obtained a doctorate in physics. In 1950, he worked as an engineer in a private factory in Ohio, USA, and had many inventions, which were valued by the factory. From that time on, he prepared to return to China. In the spring of 1951, a relative of mine who ran a factory in Hong Kong hired Zhang Shoulian to work in his factory and sent a Hong Kong British authorities entry visa. After Shoulian received the letter of employment and passport, he resigned from his job at the American factory and sold his house, ready to return home immediately. However, because he did not obtain permission from the American authorities, he did not return. Since then, we have not received any letters from him. It was not until August 1954 that I received a letter forwarded by my nephew in Sweden. After that, we did not receive any more letters from him.

From the many letters Shoulian sent us in the past, it can be seen that he loved his motherland and was eager to return to the motherland to participate in construction. However, to this day, not only has he not returned to the motherland, but he has not even seen his letters for a long time. I cannot help but suspect that this is due to the American government's deception and obstruction. Therefore, I ask the government to find ways to assist Zhang Shoulian in completing the departure procedures from the United States and get rid of the difficulties imposed by the American authorities to return to his motherland. I make this request not only out of fatherly affection, but also because I believe that Shoulian's knowledge is beneficial to the country's construction cause today. Therefore, I firmly demand that the American authorities release him to return home as soon as possible.

Zhang Xiangbing, Father of Zhang Shoulian, from Beijing

Letter from Li Hong's Father

Not long ago, I read several letters from the families of students studying in the United States in the "People's Daily," all because their sons or husbands were detained by the U.S. government and could not return to their motherland. I am also one of the victims, so I feel particularly indignant.

My son, Li Hong, studied at the University of Texas in the southern United States from the second half of 1946. Initially, he studied psychology, and later changed to biology. Until 1951, he often corresponded with me and sent me photos, on the back of which he wrote two lines of poetry saying:

	"The weary traveler gradually knows the homeland is far away,
	When will the angry horse whip home?"

This shows how much he missed his motherland and family! After 1951, there was no news. In the spring of 1952, I sent a letter to the University of Texas, but the original letter was returned, and the U.S. Post Office stamped it with the words "This person has moved, address unknown."

I think my son must have been subjected to difficulties or persecution by the American government, and he was not allowed to communicate with his family in the motherland, otherwise, he would never have suddenly cut off contact. Now the U.S. government itself admits that among the 103 Chinese who had long requested to return home, 38 have not yet returned, which shows that there must be many more people who have been detained and cannot return to their motherland. I demand that the government lodge a serious protest with the United States and let them return home as soon as possible to participate in the construction of the motherland.

Li Baiyang, Father of Li Hong, from Changsha, Hunan

    向美国政府要亲人
    ——张守廉、李弘的父亲来信——
    编者按：本报发表了七个留美学生的家属的来信以后，美国移民局还在抵赖说，“没有一个中国人不可以自由地”回国。现在我们再发表两个留美学生的父亲的来信。美国政府有责任言而有信，让他们的儿子回国。
    张守廉的父亲来信
    我的儿子张守廉在清华大学研究院物理系毕业后，1944年去美国留学，取得物理学博士学位。1950年，他在美国俄亥俄州一家私人工厂任工程师，有很多发明，受到这家工厂的重视。从那时候起，他就筹备回国。1951年春，由我在香港开设工厂的亲戚聘请张守廉到他工厂工作，并寄去香港英国当局入境签证一份。当守廉接到聘书和护照以后，就辞去了他在美国工厂的职务，并将房屋出卖了，准备立即回国。但因为没有得到美国当局的许可，没有回来。从此，我们就一直没有收到他的来信。直到1954年8月才由我在瑞典的外甥转来一信。以后，我们就没有接到他的信了。
    从守廉过去给我们的许多信里，都可以看出他对祖国的热爱和急于想回祖国参加建设的心情。但是，直到今日，他不但没有返回祖国，而且长期以来连他的信都看不到了。我不能不怀疑这是不是由于美国政府对他进行欺骗和阻难的缘故。因此，我要求政府设法协助张守廉办好离美手续，摆脱美国当局的留难回到自己的祖国来。我提出这种要求，不仅出自父子感情，而且认为守廉所具备的知识对祖国今天的建设事业是有好处的。所以我坚决要求美国当局赶快放他回国。

    李弘的父亲来信
    不久前从“人民日报”读到了几封留美学生家属的信，都是因为自己的儿子或者丈夫被美国政府扣留而不能返回祖国。我也是受害人之一，所以特别感到愤慨。
    我的儿子李弘，从1946年下半年起在美国南部得克萨斯州立大学念书。起初学心理学，后改生物学。直到1951年以前常和我通信，并寄过像片给我，背面题诗两句说：
    “倦旅渐知家国远，
    几时怒马着归鞭”，可见他多么想念祖国和家庭啊！1951年以后即无音信。1952年春我曾向得克萨斯州立大学去信，但原信却被退回，美国邮局加盖戳记说“此人已迁移，迁移地址不明”。
    我想我的儿子一定受到了美国政府的留难或者迫害，并且不许他和祖国的家人通信，否则决不会突然就断绝音讯。现在美国政府自己承认，在早就要求回国的103名中国人中，还有38名没有回国，可见被扣留而不能返回祖国的人一定还很多。我要求政府向美国提出严重抗议，让他们早日回国，好参加祖国的建设工作。
