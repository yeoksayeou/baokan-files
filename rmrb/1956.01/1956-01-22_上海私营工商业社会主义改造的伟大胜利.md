The Great Victory of the Socialist Transformation of Private Industry and Commerce in Shanghai

Following the complete collectivization of suburban rural areas and urban handicrafts in Shanghai, on January 20th of this month, all private industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai were approved to be transformed into joint state-private ownership. Shanghai has achieved a comprehensive victory in socialist transformation. The people's Shanghai has entered a socialist society. We warmly congratulate the great victory of the people of Shanghai!

Shanghai is an important industrial base in our country and also the city with the largest proportion of capitalist industry and commerce. According to the statistics in 1954, capitalist industrial enterprises in Shanghai accounted for 20.8% of the total number of capitalist industrial enterprises in the country; the output value of capitalist industry in Shanghai accounted for 41.8% of the total output value of capitalist industry in the country, of which the output value of means of production accounted for 45.8% of the total output value of means of production in capitalist industry in the country, and the output value of consumer goods accounted for 40.5% of the total output value of consumer goods in capitalist industry in the country; the total assets of capitalist industry above 10 people in Shanghai accounted for 63.2% of the total assets of capitalist industry above 10 people in the country. According to the statistics at the end of August 1955, the capital of capitalist commerce in Shanghai accounted for 13.9% of the total capital of capitalist commerce in the country, and the sales volume accounted for 14.6%. Now, following the complete implementation of joint state-private ownership in capitalist industry and commerce in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Shenyang, Nanjing, Chongqing, and Guangzhou, the capitalist industry and commerce in Shanghai has also implemented complete joint state-private ownership, which makes the vast majority of capitalist industry and commerce in the country change capitalist ownership. This means that our country's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has achieved a victory of decisive significance. Capitalist industry and commerce has taken this decisive step of complete industry-wide joint state-private ownership, which means that socialism has basically replaced capitalism. From this, it can be completely concluded that China's socialist revolution has now achieved a victory of decisive significance. This is a great victory of the wise leadership of our Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and a great victory of Marxism-Leninism.

The complete implementation of joint state-private ownership in capitalist industry and commerce in Shanghai is the result of all the brilliant achievements since the founding of our country. Over the past six years, the state has confiscated bureaucratic capital, and the strength of the socialist economy has grown and strengthened. The labor productivity of socialist industry has increased year by year, the commodity circulation speed of socialist commerce has become faster and faster, and the superiority of the socialist economy has become more and more significant. Over the past six years, some capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises have accepted joint state-private ownership. In joint state-private enterprises, capitalist relations of production have changed. Although the situation of the enterprises cannot catch up with the state-owned economy, they have developed greatly compared with the completely capitalist management. The labor productivity of the joint state-private Minsheng Shipping Company in 1955 is estimated to be 165.3% higher than when it started joint operation in 1952. The labor productivity of 47 joint state-private factories in Shanghai in 1954 increased by an average of 46.27% compared with 1953. Only completely capitalist industry and commerce has consistently failed to solve the numerous contradictions brought about by capitalist ownership to enterprises. Whether it is industrial production or commercial operation, they cannot be compared with state-owned enterprises and joint state-private enterprises. Countless facts in the past six years have shown that private enterprises are not as good as joint state-private enterprises, and joint state-private enterprises are not as good as state-owned enterprises. These facts fully prove what Lenin said: "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and principal condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system. Capitalism created a labor productivity that was unprecedented under the serf system. Capitalism can be completely defeated, and it will certainly be defeated, because socialism can create a new and much higher labor productivity." ("A Great Beginning") These facts have made capitalists (including the largest capitalists in the country) gradually realize the superiority of the socialist system and actively accept socialist transformation. It is also from the comparison of labor productivity that it can be completely asserted that after the complete implementation of joint state-private ownership in capitalist industry and commerce, the productive forces bound by capitalist relations of production will be liberated, and they will definitely be able to play a greater role in meeting the needs of national construction and people's lives.

The transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is to gradually transform capitalist enterprises and bourgeois elements according to socialist principles. This is to make enterprises subject to the state's planned management, replace capitalist relations of production with socialist relations of production, and replace capitalist business management methods with socialist business management methods; it is to educate bourgeois elements to gradually transform from exploiting elements or semi-exploiting elements into self-reliant, paid-according-to-work laborers in socialist society. However, these tasks cannot be done well in a day or two, and we must carry out these tasks steadily. Therefore, in factories and stores that have already been jointly operated, the original product specifications and varieties should not be easily changed within a certain period of time, factories and stores should not be merged casually, and personnel and service systems should not be easily changed. Instead, more observation and research should be conducted to deeply understand the laws of production and distribution, and then carefully propose reorganization and adjustment plans. In jointly operated stores, there are a large number of small stores, generally called "husband and wife stores." Some of the managers of these stores (such as cloth stores) can adopt the method of fixed interest and wages, but most of them can still maintain the form of distribution and consignment sales after joint state-private ownership. The reason why these stores are called joint state-private stores is because their source of goods in the future will be from the state, their operation will be led by specialized companies, and they can generally obey the state's plans; as for their business form, distribution and consignment sales are appropriate, because this is more conducive to improving their enthusiasm for operation. Such issues must be seriously considered and studied after the full industry or city (county) has achieved joint state-private ownership.

In the past stage, private industrialists and businessmen across the country have already demonstrated their valuable initiative in accepting socialist transformation with practical actions, and have been warmly welcomed by the people across the country. In the future, private industrialists and businessmen should continue to make persistent efforts, and more actively strive to make contributions to socialism. Under the leadership and supervision of public representatives and employees, they should conscientiously study, actively correct their business management thinking and attitude, strive to improve the business management of enterprises, and, in conjunction with the transformation of enterprises, strictly transform their ideological consciousness from labor, so that they can become self-reliant laborers. In this way, there will be a brighter future.

### 上海私营工商业社会主义改造的伟大胜利

    上海私营工商业社会主义改造的伟大胜利
    在上海郊区农村和市区手工业全部合作化以后，本月20日，上海全市私营工商业又全部被批准实行公私合营。上海市的社会主义改造已获得了全面的胜利。人民的上海，从此进入了社会主义社会。我们热烈地祝贺上海人民的伟大胜利！
    上海是我国工业的重要基地，也是我国资本主义工商业比重最大的城市。据1954年的统计，上海资本主义工业企业单位占全国资本主义工业企业总数的20.8％；上海资本主义工业的产值占全国资本主义工业总产值的41.8％，其中生产资料的产值占全国资本主义工业生产资料总产值的45.8％，生活资料的产值占全国资本主义工业生活资料总产值的40.5％；上海10人以上的资本主义工业资产总额占全国10人以上资本主义工业资产总额的63.2％。据1955年8月底的统计，上海市资本主义商业的资本额占全国资本主义商业资本总额的13.9％，销售额占14.6％。现在，继北京、天津、西安、沈阳、南京、重庆、广州等城市的资本主义工商业先后全部实行公私合营以后，上海市资本主义工商业也实行了全部公私合营，这就使得全国的绝大多数的资本主义工商业都改变了资本主义的所有制。这就意味着我国对于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作，已经取得了具有决定意义的胜利。资本主义工商业踏上了全行业公私合营的这一个决定性的一步，这就意味着社会主义基本上代替了资本主义。由此也就完全可以得出结论：中国的社会主义革命，现在已经得到了具有决定意义的胜利。这是我们的党中央和毛泽东同志英明领导的伟大胜利，是马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利。
    上海市资本主义工商业全部实行公私合营，是我国建国以来一切灿烂成就的结果。六年来，国家没收了官僚资本，生长和壮大了社会主义经济的力量，社会主义工业的劳动生产率一年比一年提高，社会主义商业的商品流转速度一年比一年快，社会主义经济的优越性一天比一天显著。六年来，部分资本主义工商业接受了公私合营，在公私合营企业里，资本主义的生产关系起了变化，企业的状况虽然赶不上国营经济，但比起完全资本主义的经营有了很大的发展。公私合营民生轮船公司1955年的劳动生产率预计比1952年开始合营的时候提高165.3％。上海47个公私合营工厂1954年的劳动生产率平均比1953年提高46.27％。只有完全资本主义工商业，始终不能解决资本主义所有制给企业带来的重重矛盾。无论是工业生产和商业经营，它们都不能同国营企业和公私合营企业相比。六年来的无数事实都说明了私营企业不如公私合营企业，公私合营企业又不如国营企业。这些事实，完全证明了列宁说过的一段话：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件。资本主义造成了在农奴制度下所没有过的劳动生产率。资本主义可以被彻底战胜，而且一定会被战胜，是因为社会主义能造成新的更高得多的劳动生产率。”（“伟大的创举”）这些事实就使得资本家（包括全国最大的资本家）都逐步认识了社会主义制度的优越性，并且积极地接受了社会主义改造。也正是从劳动生产率的比较中，完全可以断言，资本主义工商业全部实行公私合营之后，被资本主义生产关系所束缚的生产力得到解放，就一定能够在满足国家建设和人民生活的需要方面发挥更大的作用。
    对资本主义工商业的改造，就是要对资本主义企业和资产阶级分子都按照社会主义的原则逐步加以改造。这就是要使企业服从国家的计划管理，用社会主义的生产关系代替资本主义的生产关系，用社会主义的经营管理方法代替资本主义的经营管理方法；就是要教育资产阶级分子从剥削分子或半剥削分子逐步改造成为自食其力的、按劳取酬的社会主义社会的劳动人民。但是这些工作决非一朝一夕就可以作好的，我们必须稳步地进行这些工作。因此，在已经合营的工厂和商店里，在一个时期内，不应该轻易改变原有产品的规格和品种，不要随便并厂并店，不要轻易改变人事和服务制度，而应该更多地观察研究，深入了解生产和运销的规律，然后再谨慎地提出改组和调整方案。在合营的商店里，有大批小商店，一般叫作“夫妻店”。这些商店的经理人员，一部分（如布匹店）可以采取定息拿工资的办法，但大部分在公私合营以后，仍然可以维持经销和代销的形式。这部分商店之所以叫作公私合营商店，是因为今后他们的货源是国家的，经营受专业公司领导，并且大体上可以服从国家的计划；至于他们的经营形式以经销代销为宜，是因为这样更便于提高他们的经营积极性。诸如这类问题，在全行业或全市（县）实现了公私合营以后，都是必须认真加以考虑和研究的。
    全国私营工商业者在过去这一阶段中，已经用实际行动来表现了他们接受社会主义改造的可贵的积极性，受到了全国人民的热烈欢迎。今后，私营工商业者还应该再接再厉，更积极地争取为社会主义立功，要在公方代表和职工的领导和监督下，认真学习、积极端正经营管理思想和态度，努力改善企业的经营管理，结合企业的改造，从劳动中来严格地改造自己的思想意识，使自己成为自食其力的劳动者。这样，就会有更光明的前途。
