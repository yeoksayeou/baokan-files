    Steel Paper

    Steel paper is a high-grade industrial paper. Its strength is similar to that of aluminum, and it has excellent electrical insulation properties. It is not afraid of freezing, and it can withstand high temperatures. It also has mechanical processing performance, with ductility, capable of cutting, grinding, planing, and drilling; it can also be heat-treated into various shapes.

    Steel paper has many uses, and can replace leather and metal for making suitcases, miners' and welders' hats and hat brims, can be used to make cotton sliver cans and yarn boxes for the furniture and textile industries, and can also be used to make motors, lightning arresters and various safety gasket materials in the electrical industry. It can be used to make silent gears and high-pressure gaskets for the mechanical industry, railway signal parts, etc. Steel paper can also be used to manufacture the main gasket pieces for automobile fuel tanks.

    Before liberation, China's paper industry was very backward. Not only could it not produce steel paper, but even general cultural papers such as newsprint and printing paper relied on imports, which required a lot of foreign exchange every year. Now, newsprint, printing paper, etc., not only do not need to be imported, but can also be exported in large quantities. Steel paper was also successfully trial-produced in June of the year before last at the Mudanjiang Paper Mill in Heilongjiang Province, and has been mass-produced. Now, this factory is also planning to trial-produce steel paper tubes, soft steel paper, and blue steel paper.

    钢纸
    钢纸是一种高级的工业用纸。它的强度同铝差不多，具有优良的电气绝缘性，不怕冷冻，又能耐高温。它还富有机械加工性能，有延展性，能切削、研磨、刨平、钻眼；还可以经过热处理变成多种形状。
    钢纸的用途很多，可以代替皮革和金属做手提箱、矿工和电焊工的帽子、帽沿，可以做家具和纺织工业用的棉条筒、纱盒子，还可以做电动机、避雷器及电气工业中各种安全垫片材料，可以做机械工业的无声齿轮高压垫片，铁道号志零件等。钢纸还可以制造汽车油箱主要垫圈片。
    解放前，我国的造纸工业是很落后的，不仅不能生产钢纸，就是一般的文化用纸，如新闻纸、印刷纸等，都是依靠进口，每年要付出很多外汇。现在，新闻纸、印刷纸等不仅不需要进口，而且可以大量出口了。钢纸也于前年六月份在黑龙江省牡丹江造纸厂试制成功，已经大量生产。现在，这个厂还计划进行钢纸管、软钢纸、青钢纸的试制工作。
