Marching at the Forefront of Socialist Transformation
		By Our Correspondent

    Beijing is the capital of our great motherland. In the socialist transformation, the industrial and commercial circles of Beijing actively responded to the call of the Party and the government, and all private industrial and commercial enterprises in the city implemented joint state-private ownership within a few days. Since then, Beijing's private industrial and commercial enterprises have broken away from the capitalist track and embarked victoriously on the socialist road.

    As 1955 came to an end, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party formulated a plan for the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, stipulating that the capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing would basically complete the implementation of joint state-private ownership by industry in 1956. However, with the arrival of 1956, inspired by the early completion of the Five-Year Plan and the rapid development of agricultural cooperation, the upsurge of the socialist transformation of capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises also arrived rapidly.

    After the New Year, the sound of firecrackers and gongs and drums roared in the streets all day long, and colorful flag teams and waist drum teams paraded in the streets constantly. This was not to celebrate the New Year, but to express the desire to implement joint state-private ownership. Our Party and government have always determined their work based on the opinions of the masses. In order to adapt to the arrival of the upsurge and meet the wishes of the vast number of workers and industrialists and merchants to implement joint state-private ownership as soon as possible, on January 5, the person in charge of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee invited the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce and the trade associations of private commercial and service industries in the city to a forum, announcing the strengthening of leadership and accelerating the pace of transformation. As a result, the upsurge was even higher, and the speed was even faster. In the people's committees of various districts, capitalists submitted applications for joint state-private ownership in groups. Originally, these applications had already been written with their own names and stamped with their own seals, and it would have been enough for one person to send them, but in order to express the urgency of their demands, they had to submit them collectively. Moreover, the number of applications increased day by day. Taking Qianmen District as an example: on the 6th, 210 households applied to the District People's Committee; on the 7th, the number increased to 630 households. In this way, the staff of the District People's Committee received countless people who wanted to advance to socialism from morning till night.

    In these days, the changes in Beijing's appearance were not just one change a day, but several changes a day. Originally, in any street, most of the factories and shops were private enterprises, and only a few were joint state-private enterprises. Now, it has completely changed. Yesterday, this factory hung out a red streamer "Welcoming Joint State-Private Ownership," and today, another store hung out a red streamer "Celebrating Joint State-Private Ownership"; in the morning, the big stores hung out streamers to express their welcome to joint state-private ownership, and in the afternoon, the small stores also hung out streamers to express their congratulations to joint state-private ownership. Hanging streamers is like hanging national flags on National Day. On the main streets with factories and shops, red streamers are one after another, one after another, left and right, almost like two continuous "rainbows." In this upsurge, almost all the engraving shops in Beijing temporarily became paper-cutting shops specializing in "cutting paper characters," and the knives for engraving seals were all on "vacation," with their owners holding other tools and constantly cutting out words such as "Welcoming Joint State-Private Ownership" and "Celebrating Joint State-Private Ownership."

    The broad masses of industrial and commercial figures all hope to make active contributions to the cause of socialist transformation and enter socialism together with all the people. In recent days, many people in industrial and commercial circles have used their actions to show their support for the cause of socialist transformation. Li Yizan, Jiao Huanwu, and Wang Minsheng, standing committee members of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, recently jointly wrote a poem: "Elatedly leaping over the Dragon Gate, wholeheartedly wanting to be a working person, running forward together, communism lasts forever." Mao Zhichen, director of the Qianmen District Branch of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said at a meeting of industrial and commercial circles in Qianmen District: "Our Beijing is where Chairman Mao lives, and we must strive to take the first train to socialism." This poem and these words express the aspirations of many people in industrial and commercial circles for their future. Under this goal, Ma Rongwu, manager of the No. 1 Hotel in the hotel industry, Wen Shaowen, manager of Wenji Rubber Factory, Zhang Lianzhen of Xinxinglong Factory in the shoe and hat manufacturing industry, Yang Yanwen, manager of Yong'antang in the traditional Chinese medicine industry, Ding Futing, manager of Donglaishun in the catering industry, Yin Changrong, manager of Huamao Clothing Store, Song Zhipeng, manager of Yixing Trading Company, and Guan Boquan, manager of Yuantong Automobile Company, have all taken out their off-the-books assets and invested them in the enterprise. Many capitalists have also invested their off-the-books assets and "private" savings into the enterprise as a gift for joint state-private ownership.

    The workers and shop assistants of various enterprises are even more enthusiastically involved in this upsurge. More than 10,000 young workers in Beijing have formed many youth shock brigades to participate in the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises. With great enthusiasm, these young shock brigade members and the vast number of workers actively participated in the preparations for joint state-private ownership. Some workers put forward the slogan "Production and Cooperation, Both Correct," and some workers organized voluntary inventory teams to prepare to assist the public representatives in carrying out inventory and verification of assets. The workers of Tongmao Woodware Store classified and graded various materials and made a list to prepare for the public representatives' reference. The workers of Wansheng Iron Factory introduced their experience in inventorying machinery and equipment to others. In order to celebrate joint state-private ownership, the workers of Yuanda Iron Factory in Xidan District had a very high production enthusiasm, and lathe operator Yang Guangren's production efficiency increased by seven and a half times.

    Only ten days into 1956, Beijing has undergone such an earth-shaking change. This change marks a new stage in the socialist transformation of capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises. As the capital of our great motherland, Beijing has set a brilliant example in this regard. Let us cheer for this victory, congratulate this victory, and continue to advance towards victory on the basis of victory!

    走在社会主义改造的前列
    本报记者
    北京，是我们伟大祖国的首都。在社会主义改造事业中，北京的工商界积极响应党和政府的号召，全市的私营工商业在几天之内全部实行了公私合营。从此，北京的私营工商业脱离了资本主义的轨道，胜利地踏上了社会主义的道路。
    当1955年结束的时候，中共北京市委员会曾拟定了改造私营工商业的规划，规定：北京的资本主义工商业在1956年基本上完成按行业实行公私合营。可是，随着1956年的来临，在提前完成五年计划的鼓舞下，在农业合作化突飞猛进的发展中，资本主义工商业的社会主义改造高潮也迅速来到了。
    新年过后，鞭炮声、锣鼓声，整日在街头轰鸣，彩旗队、腰鼓队，不断地在街头游行，这不是为了祝贺新年，而是为了表示要求实行公私合营的愿望。我们的党和政府向来是根据群众意见来确定自己的工作的，为了适应高潮到来的形势，满足广大职工和工商业者早日实行公私合营的愿望，1月5日，北京市人民委员会负责人邀集北京市工商业联合会和全市私营商业和服务性行业的同业公会座谈，宣布加强领导，加快改造的步伐。这样一来，高潮更高了，速度更快了。在各区人民委员会，资本家们成群结队地呈递要求实行公私合营的申请书。本来，这些申请书上都已经写了自己的名字，盖了自己的图章，一个人送来就可以了，但他们为了表示自己要求的迫切，一定要来一个集体呈递。而且，申请的户数一天比一天多，以前门区为例：6日，有210户向区人民委员会申请，7日，增加到630户。就这样，区人民委员会的工作人员们，从早晨到深夜，接待着无数要求向社会主义前进的人。
    在这些日子里，北京市容的变化，不是一天一个样子，而是一天几个样子。原来，不论是那一条街道的工厂和商店，绝大多数都是私营企业，公私合营的只是少数。现在，完全变了。昨天，这一个工厂挂出了“迎接公私合营”的红幛子，今天，另一个商店又挂出了“庆祝公私合营”的红幛子；上午，大商店才挂幛子表示自己对公私合营的欢迎，下午，小商店也挂幛子表示自己对公私合营的祝贺。挂幛子好像国庆节挂国旗一样，在主要的设有工厂和商店的街道上，红幛子一个接一个，一家接一家，左右两边，几乎像两条绵延不断的“长虹”。在这个热潮中，北京的刻字店差不多都暂时地变成了“专剪纸字”的剪字店，刻图章的刀子都“休假”了，它的主人拿着另外的工具不停地剪着“迎接公私合营”、“欢迎公私合营”等字样。
    广大工商界人士都希望在社会主义改造事业中积极立功，和全体人民一道进入社会主义。这些天来，工商界的许多人都用自己的行动表明自己对社会主义改造事业的拥护。市工商联常务委员李贻赞、焦寰五、王敏生最近共同做了一首诗：“兴高采烈跳龙门，一心要做劳动人，向前奔走齐协力，共产主义万万春。”北京市工商联前门区分会主任毛质宸在前门区工商界会议上说：“我们北京，是毛主席住的地方，我们一定要争取坐第一列火车到社会主义。”这首诗，这些话，说出了许多工商界人士对自己前途的向往。在这个目标下，旅店业第一宾馆经理马荣武、文记橡胶厂经理文绍文、鞋帽制造业新兴隆厂张连珍，国药业永安堂经理杨彦文，饮食业东来顺经理丁福亭，华茂服装行经理印常荣，亿兴贸易行经理宋志鹏，远通汽车行经理关博泉等都把自己的账外资财拿出来投入了企业。还有许多资本家也纷纷将自己的账外资财、“体己”积蓄投入企业，作为给公私合营的献礼。
    各个企业的工人、店员，更是兴致勃勃地卷入了这个高潮。全北京市有一万几千青年职工组成了许多的青年突击队，参加私营工商业的改造工作。这些青年突击队员和广大职工以高度的热情，积极参加公私合营的准备工作。有的职工提出“生产合营两不误”的口号，有的职工组织志愿清产队，准备协助公方代表进行清产核资工作。同茂木器行的工人把各种器材分类分等进行了登记，列出清单，准备给公方代表参考。万盛铁工厂的工人把自己清点机器资财的经验介绍给别人。西单区元大铁工厂工人为了庆祝公私合营，生产情绪非常高涨，车工杨广仁的生产效率提高了七倍半。
    1956年刚刚过了十天，北京市就起了这样一个天翻地复的变化，这个变化标志着资本主义工商业的社会主义改造进入了新阶段。作为我们伟大祖国的首都，北京在这方面已经做出了光辉的榜样，让我们欢呼这个胜利，祝贺这个胜利，在胜利的基础上继续向胜利前进吧！
