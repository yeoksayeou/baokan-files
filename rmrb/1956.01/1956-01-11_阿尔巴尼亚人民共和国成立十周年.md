    Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of Albania
    Fadil Paçrami, Editor-in-Chief of the Albanian "People's Voice" and Representative of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania
    January 11 marks the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Albania. Ten years ago, the Albanian Constituent Assembly realized the people's aspirations of centuries and the wishes of the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the national liberation struggle, and declared the birth of the People's Republic of Albania.
    For the liberation of the motherland and national independence, and to drive out foreign occupiers and exploiters, the Albanian people united to wage a resolute struggle against the fascist invaders and domestic enemies. Thanks to the wise leadership of the Albanian Communist Party (now the Albanian Labor Party), the invincible power of the glorious Soviet army, and the existence of the liberator of the enslaved people—the Soviet Union—the decisive victory of this struggle was guaranteed. On November 29, 1944, the Albanian people finally liberated their motherland, seized power, and began to build a new life.
    In the ten years since the establishment of the People's Republic of Albania, the face of our motherland has changed greatly. Under the leadership of the Party, and with the help of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries, our people have achieved significant accomplishments in socialist construction. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people has enabled Albania to develop and progress. New industries have been established, and agriculture has also developed. Today, our country has established industries that never existed in the past, such as the machinery industry and the textile industry. Whether on new construction sites or in large socialist enterprises, such as the Stalin Textile Factory, the Enver Hoxha Metal Processing Factory in Tirana, the "November 8th" sugar refinery in Korçë, or the Rago and Spiro woodworking plants in Elbasan and the Lenin cement factory in Vlorë, the enthusiasm of people's labor is boiling everywhere. These many industrial enterprises are the glory of the creative labor of our people. In addition to the above-mentioned factories, many large-scale buildings, such as the Enver Hoxha Hydropower Station and the Çirik oil refinery, are also under construction. Just a few examples are enough to show the speed of industrial development in the People's Republic over the past decade. By the end of 1955, the total industrial output had increased 13 times compared with 1938. If we separate the industrial sectors and compare them with 1945, oil is about 7 times higher, asphalt 18 times higher, and coal more than 39 times higher. The annual power generation in 1938 can now be achieved in just 22 days, while the annual output of coal in 1938 now requires only 6 days, cotton textiles also 6 days, and cement 64 days. The food produced in just one quarter of 1955 is almost equivalent to the entire year's output in 1945.
    Our Party and the people's government have always attached special importance to the development of agriculture. The laboring peasants of our country, liberated from feudal oppression, have expanded the cultivated land area. Now the cultivated land area has expanded by 170% compared with 1938, and grain output has increased by 154%. Cotton can be said to be a new crop for our country, and its output has increased more than 62 times compared with 1938. The main reason why we have been able to achieve all these achievements in agriculture is that while carrying out socialist construction in the cities according to the Party's industrialization policy, we have also carried out socialist basic construction in the countryside. According to the Party's instructions, the socialist transformation of agriculture should gradually organize the individual economy of farmers into collectivized large-scale production. Under this instruction, the laboring peasants of our country are today advancing towards the road of collectivization with firm steps. Now we have 316 agricultural production cooperatives. They have achieved high yields in the cultivation of various crops. They have become a model for all peasants.
    The achievement of agricultural production is inseparable from the constant concern of the People's Government for the development and consolidation of agriculture. In the ten years since the establishment of the People's Government, 5,526 kilometers of canals and 2,152 kilometers of irrigation ditches have been dug. In the past, our country did not have tractors, but now, the sound of tractors and combines can be heard everywhere in our fertile fields. In 1955, the number of tractors cultivating the land in our country increased more than 19 times compared with 1947. The state helps farmers with various agricultural loans and excellent seeds.
    In the countryside of our country, a new and prosperous life has begun throughout the country. In terms of cultural undertakings, fundamental changes have also taken place in these ten years. The people of our country have eliminated the centuries-old disease of illiteracy, and hundreds of new schools have been established, opening their doors to the children of workers and peasants. Last year, the first batch of engineers, agronomists, and teachers graduated from our country's universities. Today, culture has become the property of the broad masses of people, and it serves the working people. Without the power in the hands of the people themselves, without the People's Republic, and without the fraternal friendship with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries, it is difficult to imagine the achievement of all these achievements.
    This year, our people are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic with a series of achievements in the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan (1951-1955). This series of achievements has strengthened our country's economy and laid a solid foundation for the Second Five-Year Plan. The Second Five-Year Plan puts forward even greater tasks for our people. In order to complete all these tasks, our people have begun to work, and they are confident that they will be able to complete all tasks victoriously.
    In the ten years since the People's Republic was declared, in the Albanian People's Democratic system, the Party and the government have consistently pursued a foreign policy of peace and friendship with all countries. In this regard, we have always followed the glorious principles of Lenin, namely the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Because of this, the Albanian people and their government advocate and support any proposal that helps to ease international tensions and consolidate world peace. In order to maintain peace, our government has taken a series of measures. These measures are conducive to the normalization of international relations and the improvement of relations with neighboring countries, and to enhancing the friendship with the people of all countries who are fighting to consolidate peace. However, despite the fact that the government of the People's Republic of Albania has implemented a policy of peace and cooperation over the past decade, the People's Republic of Albania has been squeezed out of the United Nations as a result of the discriminatory policies pursued by certain Western groups, especially the United States. Until recently, this unreasonable situation has changed. Last December, thanks to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union and many other countries, the UN General Assembly Security Council and the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution to admit the People's Republic of Albania and 15 other countries as members of the United Nations. After joining the United Nations, our people will continue to fight for the restoration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations organization. The Chiang Kai-shek elements who do not represent anyone should be expelled from the United Nations. We are convinced that one day this unreasonable phenomenon will end.
    The fact that Albania was declared a People's Republic is in itself a great victory for our people. Because it has given us great, sincere friends like the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various people's democratic countries. They selflessly help us in socialist construction. The relationship between socialist and peace camp countries, based on Leninist principles—equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs—develops and consolidates year by year. In the future, our people will protect the friendship with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various people's democratic countries as if they were protecting their own eyes with their own peaceful labor. Because only in this way can we further consolidate our People's Republic and further improve our international status.

    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国成立十周年
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”总编辑
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会代表  法迪尔·帕奇拉米
    1月11日是阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国成立十周年。十年前，阿尔巴尼亚制宪会议实现了人民几世纪来的愿望和在民族解放斗争中牺牲的烈士们的遗志，宣告阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国诞生。
    为了祖国的解放和民族的独立，为了赶走外国占领者和剥削者，阿尔巴尼亚人民曾一致起来向法西斯侵略者和国内敌人进行了坚决的斗争。由于有了阿尔巴尼亚共产党（即现在的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党）的英明领导，由于光荣的苏联军队的战无不胜的力量以及被奴役人民的解放者——苏联的存在，使这一斗争的决定性胜利有了保证。1944年11月29日，阿尔巴尼亚人民终于解放了自己的祖国，掌握了政权并开始建设新生活。
    在阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国建立后的十年内，我们祖国的面貌大大地改变了。在党的领导下，在苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家的帮助下，我国人民在社会主义基础建设方面已获得了重大的成就。广大劳动群众的革命热情使阿尔巴尼亚获得了发展和进步。新的工业建立起来了，农业也得到了发展。今天，我国已建立起了过去从来没有过的工业，如机械工业、纺织工业等等。无论是在新的建筑工地上，或是在社会主义的大企业中，例如在斯大林纺织工厂、地拉那恩维尔·霍查金属加工工厂，在科尔察“11月8日”制糖厂，或是在爱尔巴桑的拉果、斯比罗制木厂和发罗拉的列宁水泥工厂里，到处都沸腾着人们劳动的热情。这许多工业企业都是我国人民创造性劳动的光荣。除了上述各工厂以外，还有很多大型的建筑物，如恩维尔·霍查水电站、柴立克炼油厂等等都正在建筑中。只要举出几个例子，我们就可以看出人民共和国十年来工业发展的速度。到1955年年底为止，工业总产量比1938年增加为13倍，如果我们把工业各部门分开来和1945年相比，则石油约为7倍，沥清18倍，煤39倍多；1938年全年的发电量，现在只需用22天就达到了，而1938年全年出产的煤，现在只需用6天，棉织品也是6天，水泥为64天。仅仅在1955年一个季度内生产的食品就差不多相等于1945年全年产量。
    我们的党和人民政权对于农业的发展一向是特别重视的。从封建压迫下解放出来的我国劳动农民扩大了耕地面积。现在耕地面积已比1938年扩大了170％，粮食产量增加了154％，而棉花对我国可以说是一种新的农作物，它的产量和1938年相比也增加了62倍以上。我们之所以能够在农业方面获得这一切成就，主要是因为在根据党的工业化政策在城市中进行社会主义建设的同时，在农村中也进行了社会主义基础的建设。根据党的指示，农业的社会主义改造应该是逐步地把农民的个体经济组织起来成为集体化的大生产。在这个指示下，我国劳动农民今天正以坚定的步伐朝着集体化的道路前进。现在我国已有了316个农业生产合作社。它们在各种农作物的耕种中都获得了很高的产量。它们已成为全体农民的榜样。
    农业生产成就的获得，和人民政府对于农业的发展和巩固的不断关怀也是分不开的。人民政权建立十年来，已经开凿了5，526公里的水渠和2，152公里的灌溉渠。过去我国没有拖拉机，而现在，在我国肥沃的田野里到处可以听到拖拉机和康拜因的声音。1955年内，在我国土地上耕作的拖拉机比1947年增加了19倍以上。国家以各种农业贷款和优良的种籽帮助农民。
    在我国农村，全国各地，一种新的欣欣向荣的生活开始了。在文化事业方面，在这十年内也起了根本的变化。我国人民把几世纪来的病痛——文盲扫除了，成百所新学校纷纷建立起来，它们为工农子弟敞开着大门。去年，从我国的高等学校里毕业出来了第一批工程师、农学家和教师。今天，文化已成为广大群众的财产了，它是为劳动人民服务的。而这一切成就的获得，如果没有人民自己掌握的政权，没有人民共和国，没有和苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家的兄弟般友谊，是难以想像的。
    今年我国人民以执行第一个五年计划（1951—1955）中所获得的一系列成就来庆祝人民共和国成立十周年。这一系列成就加强了我国的经济，并为第二个五年计划建立了巩固的基础。第二个五年计划向我国人民提出了更重大的任务。为了完成这一切任务，我国人民已开始了工作，他们深信一定能够胜利地完成一切任务。
    从人民共和国宣布成立以来的十年内，在人民民主制度的阿尔巴尼亚，党和政府一贯执行着和平和各国友好的外交政策。在这方面，我们一直遵循着列宁的光辉的原则，即不同社会制度国家间的和平共处的原则。正因为这样，阿尔巴尼亚人民及其政府拥护并支持凡是有助于缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平的任何建议。为了维护和平，我国政府曾采取了一系列措施。这些措施都有助于国际关系正常化和改善同邻国关系，并增进同为巩固和平而斗争的各国人民的友谊。但是尽管在这十年来阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府执行了和平和合作的政策，由于西方某些集团特别是美国所奉行的歧视政策的结果，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国却一直被排挤在联合国的门外。直到最近，这种对我国不合理的情况才有了改变。去年12月，由于苏联和其他许多国家的共同努力，联合国大会安全理事会和联合国大会通过接纳阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和其他15个国家为联合国会员国。在参加了联合国之后，我国人民将继续为恢复中华人民共和国在联合国组织中的合法地位而斗争。不代表任何人的蒋介石分子应该从联合国驱逐出去。我们深信，总有一天会结束这种不合理的现象。
    阿尔巴尼亚宣布为人民共和国，这一事实本身对我国人民来说是一个巨大的胜利。因为它使我们获得了伟大的、真诚的、像苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家那样的朋友。它们无私地帮助我们进行社会主义建设。建立在列宁主义原则——平等、互利、互不干涉内政基础上的社会主义、和平阵营各国间的关系一年比一年发展和巩固了。我国人民今后还将以自己的和平劳动，来像保护自己的眼珠一样地保护同苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家的友谊。因为只有这样，才能够进一步巩固我们人民共和国，才能进一步提高在国际上的地位。
