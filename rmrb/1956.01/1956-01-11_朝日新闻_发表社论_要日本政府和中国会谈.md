Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 9th: "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial on January 9th, demanding that the Japanese government adjust its diplomatic relations with China in accordance with reality.

The newspaper pointed out that last year, relations between China and Japan further approached each other. There has been a significant increase in people's interactions and the exchange of materials and culture, thereby enabling a considerable increase in mutual understanding between Japan and China.

The newspaper then pointed out that starting from this relationship, gradually normalizing diplomatic relations between the two countries is something that should be promoted and was a promise made by the Hatoyama Cabinet. However, the Japanese government has shown a very strange attitude towards this, as if it were hindering it.

The newspaper believes that the relationship between China and Japan is moving in the direction of normalization, and the Japanese government cannot stop it. The Japanese Prime Minister and cabinet members should unify the government's opinions and carry out the work that can be done. The newspaper also said: "The number of countries in Asia that recognize the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and support peaceful coexistence is gradually increasing, and their voices are becoming increasingly powerful. ... In the face of this reality, it would not be a good thing if Japan made a mistake in its judgment and became the only orphan in Asia."

"Asahi Shimbun" finally said that even the United States is conducting ambassador-level talks with China. Japan should also send a responsible national representative to hold talks with China.

    “朝日新闻”发表社论
    要日本政府和中国会谈
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：“朝日新闻”在1月9日发表社论，要求日本政府依照现实来调整两国的邦交关系。
    这家报纸指出，去年，中日两国的关系有了进一步的接近，人们的往来以及物资和文化的交流都有了显著的增加，从而使日中两国间的互相了解也有了相当的增加。
    这家报纸接着指出，从这种关系做起，逐步使两国邦交正常化，这是应当加以促进的，并且是鸠山内阁许下的诺言。但是日本政府对此却表现了很奇怪的态度，好像反而在加以阻挠。
    这家报纸认为，中日两国关系正在朝着正常化的方向前进，这是日本政府阻挡不住的。日本首相和阁员应当把政府的意见统一起来，进行可以做的工作。这家报纸又说：“亚洲承认五项和平原则和支持和平共处的国家正在逐渐增加，他们的呼声也正变得日益强大。……在这种现实面前，如果日本在判断方面犯了错误，并且变成了亚洲的唯一孤儿，那不是好玩的事。”
    “朝日新闻”最后说，连美国也在同中国进行着大使级的会谈。日本也应当派能够负责的国家代表同中国进行会谈。
