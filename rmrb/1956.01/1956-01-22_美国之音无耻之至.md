Title: Voice of America is Utterly Shameless

In the matter of delaying the Sino-American talks, the United States is increasingly running out of arguments. Johnson's statement doesn't offer any real justification, and the Voice of America's support is even more distorted and chaotic, aiming to create trouble and engage in intimidation.

On January 21st, the Voice of America broadcast a so-called commentary on the Sino-American talks, insisting that China "has not complied with" and "distorted" the agreement on the issue of civilians returning home. Now, let us check the facts.

In the past four months, all law-abiding Americans in China who wished to return home have done so. The United States has never complained about this. But what about the innocent overseas Chinese in the United States? Why are many who want to return unable to do so? Why is the United States still persecuting and detaining them, even trying to force them to go to Taiwan by demanding "Taiwan entry permits"? Speaking of Americans who have broken the law in China, two-thirds of them have already been released ahead of schedule. However, not a single Chinese person in American prisons has been released and repatriated so far, and the United States refuses to provide their names, so the Indian Embassy in the United States cannot assist them, and they are completely unaware that an agreement exists.

Yes, the agreement stipulates that both sides should "take appropriate measures" to ensure that any nationals of the other country remaining in their country are "able to exercise their right to return." China has done this for innocent Americans, and within the scope of sovereignty and law, has taken measures to release two-thirds of the law-breaking Americans ahead of schedule. What about the United States? It has not done this for either category of Chinese people remaining in the United States, detaining the innocent and completely silencing those in prison. The Voice of America still dares to say that China is "reneging on its promises" and "distorting" the agreement. It truly knows no shame.

The Voice of America also insists that China is "attempting to use the issue of renouncing the use of force to cover up this distortion and act of bad faith." This statement is more suitable for the United States itself. Because the United States not only has no intention of implementing the agreement on the first item on the agenda, but also once tried to deny the second item on the agenda of the Sino-American talks. Unable to deny it, it proposed issuing a statement renouncing the use of force, but it is unwilling to reach an agreement on the so-called renunciation of force, let alone pave the way for realizing this wish—holding a meeting of Sino-American foreign ministers.

The United States has already used force in China's territory of Taiwan, and now it wants China to agree that it has some "inherent right" to "defend itself" in Taiwan. The Voice of America says that this "inherent right" is obtained by the United States based on the US-Chiang treaty. However, the US-Chiang treaty is fundamentally illegal and cannot be established. It is merely a tool for the United States to continue occupying Taiwan and interfering in China's internal affairs. The Chinese people have long declared that they will never recognize this treaty. Not long ago in history, Hitler and Tojo Hideki engaged in such "treaties" and "self-defense," and also clamored for such "inherent rights." The people of the world shattered all these "treaties," "self-defense," and "rights." The Voice of America wishfully insists on the US-Chiang treaty, saying that the United States is "assisting in the defense of Taiwan." This is simply an attempt to conflate the international dispute between China and the United States over Taiwan with China's internal affair of liberating Taiwan, so as to occupy Taiwan for a long time. This is absolutely intolerable and absolutely impermissible to the Chinese people.

The United States' occupation of Taiwan and obstruction of the Chinese people from liberating their own territory is one of the most vivid examples of the United States opposing the right of people of all countries to choose their own government. Precisely because the Chinese people chose their own government and overthrew the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime favored by the United States, the United States occupied Taiwan and carried out armed threats against the Chinese people. Now, the Voice of America says that "free countries advocate that all people have the right to choose their own government," which is the most shameless thing.

The Voice of America has said a lot, but in the final analysis, it is trying to find an opportunity to intimidate the Chinese people. The Chinese people cannot be intimidated. It has forgotten that the sovereignty of great China will never allow destruction. If "aggression is equal to suicide," then this sentence should be offered to Dulles.

### 美国之音无耻之至

    美国之音无耻之至
    在拖延中美会谈的问题上，美国越来越理曲词穷。约翰逊的声明既讲不出什么道理，美国之音的帮腔更是颠倒错乱，无非是想借端生事，进行恫吓。
    美国之音21日广播了一篇关于中美会谈的所谓评论，硬说中国“没有遵守”、“曲解”了关于平民回国问题的协议。现在，让我们核对一下事实。
    在过去4个月中，在中国的守法美侨愿意回国的都回国了，美国对这方面是从来没有怨言的。但是，在美国的无罪华侨呢？为什么许多愿意回国的不得回来？为什么美国还在迫害和扣留他们甚至想用索取“台湾入境证”的办法来强迫他们去台湾？讲到在中国犯法的美国人其中有三分之二已经提前释放了，可是在美国监狱里的中国人不要说至今没有一个被释回国，而且美国根本不肯交出他们的名单，以致印度驻美大使馆至今无法协助他们，而他们也根本不知道有一个协议。
    是的，协议是规定了双方都要“采取适当措施”，使留在自己国家内的任何对方国家的人都“能够行使其返回的权利”。中国对无罪美侨这样做了，对三分之二的犯法的美国人在主权和法律许可的范围之内也采取措施把他们提前释放。美国呢？它对这两类留在美国的中国人都没有这样做，无罪的加以扣留，在监的把他们完全阴消。美国之音还要说中国“背信”，说中国“曲解”协议，它真是不知人间有羞耻事。
    美国之音还硬说中国“企图用放弃武力这个问题来掩饰这种曲解跟背信的举动”。这句话用在美国自己身上倒很合适。因为美国不但是无心执行第一项议程的协议，而且曾经想把中美会谈的第二项议程赖掉。赖不掉，提出要发表什么放弃武力的声明，但是既不愿对所谓放弃武力达成协议，更不愿为实现这个愿望开辟途径——举行中美外长会议。
    美国已经在中国的领土台湾使用了武力，现在它还要中国答应它有什么“固有的权利”在台湾“自卫”。美国之音说，这种“固有的权利”是美国根据美蒋条约而获得的。但是，美蒋条约根本是非法的，不能成立的，它只是美国企图继续侵占台湾、干涉中国内政的一个工具。中国人民早就声明决不承认这个条约。历史过去不久，希特勒和东条英机曾经搞过这种“条约”和“自卫”，也叫嚷过这种“固有的权利”。世界人民却把这些“条约”、“自卫”和“权利”通通给粉碎了。美国之音一相情愿地硬扯美蒋条约，说什么美国“协助保卫台湾”，这无非是想把美国造成的中美关于台湾的国际争端同中国解放台湾的内政问题混在一起，以便长期侵占台湾。这是中国人民绝对不能容忍也绝对不能容许的。
    美国侵占台湾、阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土，是美国反对各国人民有权选择自己的政府的最生动的事例之一。恰恰是因为中国人民选择了自己的政府，推翻了美国所宠爱的蒋介石反动政权，美国才侵占台湾，才对中国人民实行武力威胁。现在，美国之音却说什么“自由国家主张所有的人民都有权挑选他们自己的政府”，这才是无耻之尤。
    美国之音说了许多，归根到底还是想找机会来恫吓中国人民。中国人民是吓不倒的，它忘记了，伟大的中国的主权绝不容许破坏。如果说“侵略就等于自杀”的话，这句话正应该奉送给杜勒斯。
