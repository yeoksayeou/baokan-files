    Strange "Esophageal Cancer"

    Editor:
    On November 14, 1955, the mother of an employee of the former Rehe Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, old Mrs. Li, went to the emergency department of Rehe Provincial Hospital for treatment. While eating, she got a piece of unchewed beef stuck in her esophagus and couldn't swallow it.
    Dr. Li from the emergency department diagnosed and fluoroscoped the patient, writing the three words "esophageal cancer" on the diagnosis report. He also said to the patient's son, "There's a 'tumor' growing in the esophagus, it can't be cured, just try to let her live a few more days!"
    This postal and telecommunications worker, with tears in his eyes, accompanied his mother home and immediately began preparing for her funeral. He even borrowed money from his work unit to buy a coffin. His family was immersed in extreme grief.
    Who knew that after suffering for three days, the patient was able to drink water on the fourth day. She drank a mouthful of water too quickly and the beef stuck in her esophagus went down. As a result, the "tumor" that "couldn't be cured" disappeared, and the "patient" who had her funeral preparations ready was safe and sound!
    However, people have to ask: How exactly did Dr. Li, who made the "esophageal cancer" diagnosis, treat his work?

    奇怪的“食道癌”编辑同志：
    1955年11月14日，前热河邮电管理局一位职工的母亲李老太太到热河省立医院急诊部去治病。她在吃饭的时候把一块没有嚼烂的牛肉卡在食道里，咽不下去了。
    急诊部的李大夫对病人进行了诊断和透视，在诊断书上写上了“食道癌”3个大字，还对病人的儿子说：“食道里长了个‘肉瘤子’，不能治了，只好想法多活两天吧！”
    这位邮电职工含着眼泪陪着自己的母亲回家，马上就为她准备后事，还向机关借钱买了棺材。他的一家，都浸沉在极度的悲痛中。
    谁知道，病人痛苦了3天，第四天就能喝水了。一口水喝急了，把卡在食道里的牛肉送了下去。于是，“不能治”的“肉瘤子”不翼而飞了，已经准备好后事的“病人”也就安然无事了！
    但是，人们要问：作出“食道癌”诊断的李大夫究竟是怎样对待自己工作的？
