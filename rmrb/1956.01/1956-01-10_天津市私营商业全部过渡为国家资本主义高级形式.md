Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th. Tianjin's private businesses have completely transitioned to advanced forms of state capitalism. Fifty out of the city's 51 industries have already implemented full industry-wide public-private partnerships, and the remaining grain industry has become a retail outlet for state-owned grain stores.

At 4:00 PM today, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee approved the implementation of full industry-wide public-private partnerships in 41 industries, including department stores, clothing, shoes and hats, and Chinese medicine. Preparation committees for public-private partnerships in 33 of these industries were established today, and preparation committees for the remaining eight industries will be established within the next few days.

When the news of the government's approval of these industries' implementation of public-private partnerships spread, tens of thousands of shop assistants and capitalists waiting in the streets for the good news immediately spread the word. Instantly, gongs and drums resounded throughout the city, and firecrackers crackled. At night, the streets were brightly lit, and shop assistants' clubs in various districts and many shops approved for joint operation held gatherings and symposiums.
