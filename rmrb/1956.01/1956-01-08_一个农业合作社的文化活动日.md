　　A Cultural Activity Day at an Agricultural Cooperative
　　Zhang Ying
　　Early in the morning, a small red flag was hung in front of the home of every member of the Lianhe Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chaoxian County, Anhui Province. This small flag tells people: this is the day of rest for the whole cooperative every half month. On this day, the members of the Lianhe Cooperative will carry out many meaningful cultural activities.

　　From early morning, various activities centered around the club began: amateur theater actors rehearsing plays, dancing, singing, playing the huqin, beating drums, and preparing for the evening's program; the current affairs propaganda team was also active, producing quick reports, big-character posters, holding exhibitions, and inviting people to give lectures; the cultural learning committee was also busy writing the cultural learning achievements of the members on a large piece of white paper and posting it on the wall of the people's school; every household was cleaning and tidying up; the cooperative affairs committee members were discussing and summarizing the production and cultural activities of the past half month on this day, studying and arranging the work for the next half month. In short, this day is a day for the whole cooperative to review production and learning, and it is also a day for centralized activities at the club.

　　On this day, the activities of the production technology research group brought the members many things that they urgently needed in production. The production technology research group held collective meetings and studied more than 50 times, studying the content of each season. They also announced the matters of improving technology at the members' congress for implementation.

　　When the projectionist of the current affairs propaganda team came over carrying the slide projector and gasoline lamp borrowed from the cultural station, people rushed up to surround the projectionist, all wanting to know what film was being shown today as soon as possible. The content of the slides was often about their own lives, so the members loved to watch them. The slides gave them a lot of rich knowledge. When promoting the three agricultural production reforms, some members did not understand what "three reforms" meant, some were skeptical about improved varieties, and some were worried about planting double-cropping rice. At this time, slides were shown, combined with picture and model exhibitions, which enlightened the members' thinking and finally made the "three reforms" methods implemented.

　　In the evening, it was even more lively. On the stage of the club, two bright gasoline lamps were hanging, and the room was packed with people: men, women, old and young, crowded together. Children were running back and forth in the crowd. After a while, there was a burst of gongs and drums on the stage, and the curtain slowly rose. An old man stood on the stage and sang a mountain song with a unique style; "Turn over and don't forget the Communist Party, do a good job in production with mutual assistance!" The words were simple, and the emotions were sincere and moving. In the crowd below the stage, someone was quietly saying, "My grandpa's singing today is not as good as usual." It turned out that this was his young grandson, who criticized him with gestures before his grandfather finished singing, causing a burst of laughter.

　　Programs were performed one after another, including storytelling with clapper talk, comic dialogues, dances such as "Peeling Hemp Dance" and "Ten Sisters," and songs such as Yangko chorus and folk song chorus. Finally, the inverted seven opera "Two Brothers" came on stage. The actors performed the play as naturally as they were re-enacting their daily lives. The actor Jiang Daoyuan once told people: "I myself have trafficked in live pigs. At that time, I didn't know what socialism was and what capitalism was. Only after acting in the play did I clarify my thinking. I just acted according to my intentions when trafficking in live pigs at that time, and it didn't take any effort."

　　In the Lianhe Cooperative, feudal ideas have been defeated. Parents feel that it is an honor for their children to perform for everyone and perform well. Hu Jiying's mother-in-law, an active member of the amateur theater troupe, bought her a velvet coat to wear for the performance, encouraging her and saying: "If you perform well, it will be the glory of our two families!" Old man Jiang Jiatuan promised his daughter that as long as she performed well, he would definitely buy her a fountain pen to write and learn culture. The actors understood the purpose of the activities and naturally became generous. They once participated in the provincial performance and won an award; the actor Hu Jiying also participated in the national performance and went to Beijing.

　　Such cultural activity days have been held 55 times. As long as there are no special circumstances, cultural activity days are always held on time. The members all like the activities of this day, and they said: "It's like smoking, it's already addictive." "Cultural activities are the driving force for us to move forward." More and more people are participating in cultural activities. Now, among the 171 members of the cooperative, excluding young children, 121 people have participated in one or several literary and artistic activities. Farmers from three to five li away also come to participate by climbing over mountains and ridges, and everyone is as close as a family.

### 一个农业合作社的文化活动日

　　一个农业合作社的文化活动日
    张滢
    清早，安徽省巢县联合农业生产合作社的每个社员的家门口，都挂上一面小红旗，这面小旗告诉人们：这是全社每半月中休息的一天，这一天，联合社的社员们将要进行许多有意义的文化活动。
    从清早起，以俱乐部为中心的各种活动就开始了：业余剧团演员们排戏、跳舞、唱歌、拉胡琴、打锣鼓、准备着晚会的节目；时事宣传小组也活跃起来了，出快报、大字报，开展览会，请人作讲演；文化学习委员也忙着把社员学文化的成绩，写在一张大白纸上，贴上民校的墙壁；家家户户打扫清洁卫生；社务委员们在这一天讨论总结半月来生产和文化活动情况，研究、安排下半月工作。总之，这一天是全社生产、学习大检阅的一天，也是俱乐部集中活动的一天。
    这一天，生产技术研究组的活动给社员们带来了许多生产上极需要的东西。生产技术研究组，集体开会研究过50次，什么季节就研究什么内容。他们并把改进技术的事情在社员大会上宣布执行。
    时事宣传组的放映员提着从文化站借来的幻灯机和汽灯一走过来，人们就争先恐后地一拥而上，把放映员团团围住了，大家都想早一点知道今天放映什么片子。幻灯片子的内容，常常是他们自己生活中的事情，因此社员们都很爱看。幻灯片给他们许多丰富的知识，推行农业生产三项改革的时候，有的社员不懂什么叫“三改”，有的对优良品种怀疑，对种双季稻有顾虑。这时就放映幻灯片，配合了图片、模型展览，启发了社员的思想认识，终于使“三改”办法推行开了。到晚上，可就更热闹了。俱乐部的舞台上，悬着两盏明晃晃的大汽灯，屋里挤满了人群：男女老少，挤在一堂。孩子们在人丛里穿来穿去。不一会，只听得台上一阵锣鼓响，大幕徐徐升起了。一位老大爷站在台上唱起有独特风格的山歌；“翻身不忘共产党呐，搞好生产靠互助呵！”语词是朴实的，感情是真切动人的。台下人群中却有人在悄悄地说：“我爷今天唱的没有往常唱的好听。”原来这是他的小孙子，不等爷爷唱完，就指手划脚地批评起来了，引起人们一阵大笑。
    节目一个一个演出，说唱有快板、相声，舞蹈有“剥麻舞”、“十大姐”，歌唱有秧歌联唱、民歌合唱，最后，倒七戏“两兄弟”上场了。演员们就像是在重演他们日常生活那样自然地表演着这个戏。演员江道元曾经告诉人说：“我自己也贩过毛猪，当时思想上不晓得什么是社会主义，什么是资本主义，演了戏才把我的思想搞清楚了。我就照当时贩毛猪的心意去演，一点不费劲。”
    在联合社里，封建思想已经被打退了，父母们都觉得自己的孩子给大家演戏，演得好是光荣的事情。业余剧团活跃分子胡吉英的婆婆为她买件绒衣穿着演戏，鼓励她说：“你演得好，就是娘婆二家的光荣！”老大爷江家传答应他的闺女，只要演得好，一定替她买一支自来水笔写字学文化。演员们懂得了活动的目的，就自然大方起来。他们曾经参加了省里的会演，得了奖；演员胡吉英还参加了全国的会演，到过北京。
    这样的文化活动日已经举行了55次了。只要没有特殊情况，文化活动日总是按时举行。社员们都喜欢这一天的活动，他们纷纷说：“就像吸烟一样，已经有瘾了。”“文化活动是推动我们前进的力量。”参加文化活动的人越来越多，现在全社171个社员中，除幼年儿童外，有121人都分别参加一项至几项的文艺活动。附近三、五里路的农民也有的翻山越岭来参加，大家都像一家人那样亲热。
