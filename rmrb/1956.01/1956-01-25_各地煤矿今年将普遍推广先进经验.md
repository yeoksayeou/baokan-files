Coal Mines Across the Country Will Universally Promote Advanced Experiences This Year

    The Ministry of Coal Industry is currently summarizing significant advanced experiences in production and preparing to promote them universally in coal mines across the country. The "One-Shift Coal Mining System," which is prepared for further implementation in coal mines nationwide, has proven effective in the Jiaozuo Wangfeng Mine and the Huainan Xinzhuangzi Mine. Its characteristics include concentrated production areas, simplified procedures, clear division of labor, rational organization of labor, and high utilization rates of machinery, which can ensure regular cyclic operations. After implementing the "One-Shift Coal Mining System," more than 82% of the coal mining teams at Huainan Xinzhuangzi Mine can achieve 25 regular cycles per month. After reorganization, the labor organization transferred more than 180 people to support tunneling and capital construction work. If this advanced experience is promoted across the country on suitable working faces, the annual increase in coal production will be equivalent to the output of several newly established large-scale mines. If mines use reinforced concrete supports in permanent roadways and metal props in coal mining faces, they can save a large amount of timber. This year, mines across the country plan to use 300,000 reinforced concrete roadway supports, which are expected to save 3 million yuan. At the same time, the mines are also preparing to extensively promote the use of metal props and improve labor organization and other advanced experiences. (Fu Zhenkun)

    各地煤矿今年将普遍推广先进经验
    煤炭工业部正在总结生产方面的重大先进经验，准备分别在全国各地煤矿普遍推广。全国煤矿准备进一步推行的“一班采煤制”，在焦作王封矿、淮南新庄孜矿等推广的经验证明，它的特点是生产地区集中，工序简化，分工明确，劳动组织安排合理，机械利用率高，能够保证正规循环作业。淮南新庄孜矿在推行“一班采煤制”以后，82％以上的采煤队都可以达到每月25个正规循环，劳动组织经过整顿，调出180多人支援掘进和基本建设工作。如果全国在条件适合的工作面都推广这个先进经验，每年增产的煤将等于新建立几对大型矿井的产量。各矿如果在永久性巷道使用钢筋混凝土支架和在采煤工作面使用金属支柱的经验以后，都能节省大量木料。今年全国各矿计划使用30万架钢筋混凝土坑道支架，预计可以节约300万元。同时，各矿还准备大量推广使用金属支柱、改善劳动组织等先进经验。（傅振坤）
