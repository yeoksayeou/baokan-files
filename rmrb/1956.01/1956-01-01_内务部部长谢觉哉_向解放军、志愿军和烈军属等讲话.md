(Xinhua News Agency, December 31st) Minister of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Xie Juezai, delivered a New Year's Day address titled "Carry Forward Revolutionary Traditions, Strive for Greater Glory" to all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers. Excerpts are as follows:

    Dear comrades, all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

    Dear comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers!

    The New Year's Day of 1956 has arrived. With infinite joy, I extend to you my heartfelt congratulations and warm greetings.

    The New Year's Day of 1956 arrives under the following circumstances: Our country's first five-year plan for developing the national economy has been implemented for three years, and there has been leaping progress in all aspects of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, with most exceeding the original plans.

    In the national people's socialist construction cause, the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers have played a great role. In 1956, hundreds of thousands of demobilized construction soldiers returned to the countryside and cities, which are undergoing socialist construction and socialist transformation in full swing. They will work hard to participate in labor and production. In 1956, hundreds of thousands of active soldiers were conscripted into the army, and they personally witnessed and participated in socialist construction and socialist transformation. They will redouble their vigilance and fight to the end to eliminate the sabotage of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang.

    Chairman Mao wrote an inscription for the people of the old revolutionary base areas: "Carry forward revolutionary traditions and strive for greater glory." In the past, you demonstrated unparalleled strength in the revolutionary war and in the construction cause. It is hoped that you will continue to contribute all your wisdom and talent to the magnificent cause of socialist construction and socialist defense. Carry forward the revolutionary traditions of many years and create greater glory.

    内务部部长谢觉哉
    向解放军、志愿军和烈军属等讲话
    据新华社31日讯　1956年元旦，中华人民共和国内务部部长谢觉哉用“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的题目，向中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军全体官兵和革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人发表慰问讲话。摘要如下：
　　亲爱的中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军全体官兵同志们！
　　亲爱的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人同志们！
    1956年的元旦到来了。我怀着无限快乐的心情，向你们致以衷心的祝贺和热情的慰问。
    1956年的元旦，是在这样的情况下来到的：我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划已经执行了三年，在社会主义工业化和农业、手工业、资本主义工商业社会主义改造的各个方面都有了飞跃的进展，并且大部分超过了原定的计划。
    在全国人民进行社会主义建设事业中，革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人起了很大的作用。1956年有大几十万复员建设军人复员到热火朝天地在进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的乡村和城市。他们将努力参加劳动和生产。1956年有大几十万被征集入伍的现役军人，他们亲眼看到了、亲手参加了社会主义建设和社会主义改造，他们将百倍地提高警惕，为消灭帝国主义和蒋匪帮的破坏而奋斗到底。
    毛主席为老根据地的人民题词：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。你们过去在革命战争中、在建设事业中表示了无比的力量，希望你们继续把自己的全部智慧和才能贡献给壮丽的社会主义建设和社会主义的保卫事业。发扬许多年来革命传统，创造更伟大的光荣。
