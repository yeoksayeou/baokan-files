Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: The promotion and allocation of fine varieties of rice, cotton, etc., are being carried out on a large scale throughout the country. This is a major measure to increase production before this year's spring plowing.

This year, the provinces and regions are promoting more varieties of fine rice and cotton seeds than in previous years, and in larger quantities. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, recently, the famous Tianjin Xiaozhan rice seed "Yinfang" was transferred from Tianjin Prefecture in Hebei Province and Tianjin City to Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces, reaching more than 50 million jin. Hubei, Hunan, Anhui and other provinces will also transfer more than 9.6 million jin of japonica rice varieties such as "Aomori No. 5", "Atomic No. 2", "Beihai No. 1" and "Guoguang" from Jilin Province and Heilongjiang Province. Zhejiang, Henan and other provinces have also exchanged various fine varieties. These fine varieties generally have very high yields and good quality. At the same time, they are more resistant to fertilizer and cold. The yield of Xiaozhan rice planted in Tianjin is generally more than 600 or 700 jin per mu, and the yield of better cultivation reaches more than 1,000 jin. These rice seeds were tested by the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute in Anhui, Sichuan and other provinces last year, and the growth was good.

This year, the planting area of fine cotton varieties will reach 78 million mu. Recently, as much as 120 million jin of Daizi cotton varieties have been transferred from Jiangsu and Sichuan to Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Hebei, Zhejiang and other provinces. Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan and other provinces are also preparing to promote cotton varieties such as "517" and "Sizi Erbi" this year. The yield and quality of these fine varieties are higher than the original varieties in the local area, and the soil and natural conditions in these provinces are also suitable for the growth of these types of cotton.

Recently, 180 million jin of Heilongjiang potato varieties, with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu, will be transferred to Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces; now, 40 to 50 million jin have been transferred to Hebei. In addition, many fine varieties of corn have also been transferred.

This batch of fine varieties of rice, cotton, etc. are being transported to various places in batches, and most of them have been inspected and disinfected by agricultural science departments in various places before transportation.

    春耕前的一项重大增产措施
    各地大力调拨稻棉良种
    据新华社17日讯　稻、棉等良种的推广和调拨工作，正在全国各地大规模地进行。这是今年春耕前的一项重大的增产措施。
    今年各省区推广稻、棉等良种的品种比往年多，数量大。据农业部了解，最近从河北省天津专区和天津市调往四川、湖北、湖南、安徽、江苏等省的著名天津小站稻种“银坊”就达5，000多万斤。湖北、湖南、安徽等省还将从吉林省和黑龙江省调进“青森五号”、“原子二号”、“北海一号”“国光”等梗稻良种960多万斤。浙江、河南和其他各省也都进行了各种良种的调换。这些良种的产量一般都很高，质量都很好。同时耐肥力和抗寒力都较强。天津种植小站稻的产量一般都在六、七百斤以上，栽培得比较好的产量达1，000斤以上。这些稻种经过华中农业科学研究所去年在安徽和四川等省试种结果，生长情况良好。
    今年棉花良种的种植面积将达7，800万亩。最近仅从江苏、四川调往山东、河南、山西、河北、浙江等省的岱字棉良种就达12，000万斤。四川、陕西、河南等省今年还准备推广“五一七”和“斯字二比”等棉种。这些良种的产量和质量都比当地原来的品种为高，同时这些省的土壤和自然条件也适宜于这类棉花生长。
    产量每亩一般都在1，000斤以上的黑龙江省马铃薯良种，最近将有18，000万斤调往广东、广西、湖南、湖北和安徽等省；现在调往河北的已经达四、五千万斤。此外，还调运了许多玉米良种。
    这批稻、棉等良种正在分批运往各地，在调运前大部都经过各地农业科学部门的检验和消毒。
