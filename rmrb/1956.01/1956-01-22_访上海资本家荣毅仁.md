On the eve of the application for joint state-private ownership by all private industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai, this reporter interviewed Rong Yiren, General Manager of the Shenxin Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory Management Office.

Rong Yiren's residence is very quiet. The living room is elegantly furnished, and through the milky white gauze curtains, you can see a garden where flowers and trees are neatly trimmed. A piano, favored by his daughters, is placed diagonally by the window. When the reporter visited, Rong Yiren was away attending a meeting and had not yet returned. His wife was preparing to take their third daughter to the Children's Palace, where the Young Pioneers were having a gathering and had invited her to speak. His two eldest daughters, who are studying in high school, have their final exams tomorrow. A son in junior high school had just finished his exams and cheerfully walked in, greeting his mother by saying that their school would soon be changed from private to municipal.

Soon, Rong Yiren hurried back. This representative of the Rong family, who owns 24 textile, printing and dyeing, flour, and machinery factories in eight major cities in China, is 40 years old this year. As the Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, he has been busy with the work of joint state-private ownership for over a week, often returning home very late.

When the reporter asked him, "As a capitalist, why did you choose the path of socialism?" he said, "Yes, I am a capitalist, but first and foremost, I am a Chinese person, and I think I should start by talking about being a Chinese person."

"Yesterday, my whole family was out. My wife attended the city's representative meeting of industrial and commercial families. She had been busy preparing for this meeting for many days. My younger brother attended the representative meeting of industrial and commercial youth, and he will also go to Beijing to attend the National Congress of Young Activists in Industry and Commerce. My three children who are studying in middle school attended the children's meeting of industrial and commercial figures. They all spoke at the mass meeting of tens of thousands of people, supporting the Communist Party, thanking Chairman Mao, not only liking socialism, but also looking forward to the early realization of communism."

"Is this sincere or false? Many friends from capitalist countries who come to Shanghai are particularly surprised by this question. They came to me to ask, some asked me to tell them the 'truth' in private. A British parliamentarian asked me to speak directly in English. Some came to see if I still had my own residence. Some suspected that I was a Communist pretending to be a capitalist. I frankly told them that before liberation, I had not only never come into contact with the Communist Party, but I was also a little afraid of it at the time. A Tunisian guest saw my family and business, heard my experiences and insights, and shook my hand before leaving, saying, 'Now, I can say that the questions I brought to China have been resolved.'"

Rong Yiren sank deeply into the soft sofa and began to recall the past.

He said, "China's national industry and commerce mostly developed during the First World War when imperialism slightly relaxed its aggression against China. My father and uncle also started and developed their businesses during this period. In those years, the people of the whole country launched patriotic movements against imperialism. My father's generation dreamed of developing industry to save the country. After the war ended, imperialism came back with a vengeance, Japan stepped up its aggression against China, and coupled with years of civil war and the impact of the economic crisis of foreign capitalism, our enterprises encountered great difficulties. My father's generation once placed their hope on the Kuomintang government after the Northern Expedition, but Chiang Kai-shek's first move after taking power was to groundlessly issue an arrest warrant for my uncle Rong Zongjing and extort 100,000 silver dollars. In 1934, when Shenxin was at its most difficult, my father mortgaged assets worth three to four million yuan to the Bank of China and the Shanghai Bank, signing a loan contract for 5 million yuan. At that time, Song Ziwen, the head of bureaucratic capital, wanted to take the opportunity to squeeze out Shenxin and devour our business; when the bank only paid 2.8 million yuan, he forcibly stopped further payments. Even after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek's Shanghai Garrison Command special agents kidnapped my 70-year-old father, Rong Desheng, for more than 40 days, extorted more than 200,000 US dollars in ransom, and gave even more rewards to the so-called 'case-solved' Garrison Command."

Rong Yiren continued, "In China under the rule of the Kuomintang, the Huangpu River was full of American warships, and American goods poured in like a tide. Most of the American cotton was used in our cotton mills, and China's industry and rural areas went bankrupt. American soldiers rampaged on the streets, and female students in Beijing were raped. My father's ideal of saving the country through industry was shattered. Even my wife, although at the time all she thought about was how to live a comfortable life, but as a Chinese person, how could she tolerate the humiliation of her compatriots by foreign soldiers? At that time, we all hoped for an independent and strong motherland. But Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang would only bring more humiliation to the motherland."

Rong Yiren asked, "Who will build an independent and strong country? At that time, we did not expect it to be the Communist Party."

He continued, "On the eve of liberation, our family was apprehensive about the arrival of the Communist Party. Among our brothers, some went to Thailand to set up factories, and some hid in Hong Kong. My father hated imperialism and the Kuomintang so much that he firmly refused to leave the motherland. I didn't want to be a 'white Chinese,' so I stayed with him. Our company's working capital was already exhausted at that time, and after liberation, it was blockaded and bombed by the United States and the Kuomintang. During this period, Shenxin was able to maintain production entirely by relying on the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, which cared for national industry and commerce, and provided loans, processing, and procurement, as well as the unity and active production of the workers. The government helped us establish a general management office to unify the management of the various factories that were previously scattered, and guided us to gradually improve our management. As a result, production has developed, and the productivity of spindles has increased by more than 40%. Since 1951, profits have increased year by year, and in 1953, profits reached more than one-fourth of the total capital. The initial form of state capitalism enabled our enterprises to completely get rid of the predicament at the beginning of liberation. But the factory that my younger brother set up in Thailand went bankrupt."

"What's even more important is that in the six years since liberation, the country has become strong. This is what every Chinese person who came from the old China is most proud of. I often come into contact with the leaders of the Communist Party and the People's Government. In the most difficult economic times, in the most tense situations, every analysis of the Party, every policy of the Party, every word of Chairman Mao, was thorough and comprehensive, steady and decisive, and what was said was done. As a result of the rural land reform, cotton production exceeded the highest level in history, and our spinning mills no longer rely on foreign cotton. The victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea shattered our previous fears of imperialism. Then, the Five-Year Plan began, and many large factories were built throughout the country, and large-scale construction was carried out in various places. Everything was realized faster than dreams, which is so encouraging! Without the Communist Party, without taking the road of socialism, how could there be today!"

At this moment, the reporter interrupted Rong Yiren's excited conversation and asked him to talk about his understanding of socialism.

Rong Yiren continued, "I have received six years of socialist education. In 1952, I went to Moscow and visited several other cities in the Soviet Union. I saw with my own eyes that the living standards of Soviet workers were not only not worse than those of ordinary capitalists in our country, but even much better. People who make greater contributions to society live better than me. From the perspective of personal material life alone, socialism has nothing to fear for us Chinese capitalists, on the contrary, it is worth envying. From the perspective of production, we don't need to compare socialist planned economy with capitalist speculation and infighting. Just the fact that the factory abolished the body search system for workers can show the superiority of socialism. After the abolition of the body search system, workers' personalities were given due respect, and in the past few years, very few workers have taken things out of the factory. After enterprises were incorporated into state capitalism, especially after the implementation of joint state-private ownership, the workers' enthusiasm for labor was greatly improved, and they consciously abide by labor discipline. What could not be achieved in the past by using punishment and dismissal oppression methods was accomplished by reforming the old capitalist system. From these aspects alone, I realized that the capitalist relations of exploitation must be eliminated."

The reporter further bluntly asked: What have you lost and what have you gained by eliminating exploitation and abolishing the capitalist system?

Rong Yiren thought for a while and quickly replied: "For me, what is lost is some of my personal exploited income, which is so insignificant compared to the total investment of the country's first Five-Year Plan; what is gained is a socialist country where everyone is prosperous and strong. For me, what is lost is the deceit and distrust between people in the exploiting class; what is gained is the love and trust between working people, which cannot be bought with money. Because I actively support the Communist Party and the People's Government, and voluntarily accept transformation, and have done some work in the industrial and commercial circles that is beneficial to socialism, I have been trusted by the government and respected by the people, and have gained honor and status. From the perspective of material life, I have not actually lost anything, and I am still living very well."

Rong Yiren said as he was about to end his conversation: "Eliminating exploitation and building a prosperous and strong socialist society is the aspiration of the people of the whole country." He pointed to the children sitting together and said with a smile: "Some of them want to be musicians, and some want to be engineers, but none of them want to be capitalists. Their future does not require me to buy it with money. Everyone recognizes that only by implementing socialism and taking the road of universal prosperity can China become strong and prosperous. The Communist Party and the People's Government have adopted a policy of peaceful transformation of the national bourgeoisie, arranged a way out for us, cultivated and trained our technical and business abilities through a process of joint state-private ownership, and supported our social and political activities that are beneficial to the country. Work, study, and life are well taken care of. As long as you work hard, you can become a self-reliant laborer of a glorious socialist society."

When the reporter asked about his current life and future plans, he said with a smile: "In the past few years, the profits I have received from the company, if I want to spend it myself, I really have no way to spend it. My company has already implemented joint state-private ownership, and is also preparing to implement the fixed interest rate method, so that the annual profit is even more guaranteed. I have already expressed my determination at the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress meeting: I will definitely use the profits I have obtained to support the country's construction by investing in enterprises and purchasing public bonds. I personally am willing to do my duty in any job, and be a person who contributes to the country and to socialism."

Before the reporter said goodbye, Rong Yiren's whole family sat together again, and he read a few paragraphs of the reporter's interview record to his wife and children.

    访上海资本家荣毅仁
    新华社记者　徐中尼
    在上海市私营工商业全部申请公私合营的前夕，记者访问了申新棉纺织印染厂总管理处总经理荣毅仁。
    荣毅仁的住宅很幽静，住宅的客厅陈设雅致，透过乳白的纱窗帘，可以看到一片花木修剪得很整齐的园地。靠窗斜摆着一架他的女儿们所喜爱的钢琴。当记者去访问的时候，荣毅仁在外面开会还没有回来，他的夫人正在准备带第3个女儿去少年宫，那里，少先队员有一个集会，邀请她去讲话。两个在高中学习的大女儿，明天要期终考试了。一个在初中念书的儿子刚刚结束考试，欢跃地走进来，迎着他妈妈说他们的学校就要由私立改为市立了。
    不久，荣毅仁匆匆忙忙地赶回来了。这位在中国八个主要城市里拥有24个纺织、印染、面粉和机械工厂的荣氏家族的代表，今年40岁了。作为上海市工商业联合会的副主任委员，他一个多星期以来就为公私合营的工作而忙碌着，经常忙到很晚才回家。
    当记者向他提出“作为一个资本家，为什么选择了社会主义的道路”的时候，他说：“是的，我是一个资本家，但是我首先是一个中国人，我想应该先从作为一个中国人谈起。”
    “昨天，我的家庭全都出动了。我的爱人出席了全市工商界家属代表会议，她参加这次会议的筹备工作，已经忙碌好多天了；我的弟弟出席了工商界青年代表会议，他还要去北京参加全国工商界青年积极分子大会；我的三个在中学念书的孩子出席了工商界子女大会。他们都在上万人的大会上讲了话，拥护共产党，感谢毛主席，不仅喜欢社会主义，还盼望早点实现共产主义。”
    “这是真心还是假话？到上海来访问的不少资本主义国家的朋友们对这个问题特别感到诧异。他们曾来找我问我，有的要我背着人讲讲‘真心话’，一位英国的议员要我直接用英语谈话，有的来看看我还有没有自己的住宅，有的怀疑我是不是共产党员假冒的资本家。我坦白地告诉他们，解放前我不但没有接触过共产党，而且当时还有点害怕哩。一位突尼斯的客人看到了我的家庭和企业，听到了我谈的经历和体会，他临走时握着我的手说：‘现在，我带到中国来的疑问可以说是解决了’”。
    荣毅仁把自己深深地埋在柔软的沙发里，开始了过去的回忆。
    他说：“中国的民族工商业大都是在第一次世界大战期间帝国主义稍稍放松对中国的侵略的时候发展起来的。我的父亲和伯父也是在这个时期开始创办和发展了自己的企业。这些年代，全国人民掀起了反对帝国主义的爱国运动。我父亲一辈人，梦想着办工业，救国图强。当战争结束以后，帝国主义卷土重来，日本加紧了对中国的侵略，加上连年内战和外国资本主义经济危机的影响，我们的企业就遇到了很大的困难。父亲一辈曾经把希望寄托给北伐以后的国民党政府，可是蒋介石上台后对我们的第一手，却是无端通缉了我的伯父荣宗敬，敲诈了10万银元。1934年，当申新最困难的时候，我父亲以价值三四千万元的财产抵押给中国银行和上海银行，签订借款500万元的合同。当时官僚资本的头子宋子文想乘机挤垮申新，吃掉我们的企业；当银行只付了280万元时，他就强制停止继续付款。直到抗战胜利以后，蒋介石的淞沪警备司令部特务还把我70岁的父亲荣德生绑去40多天，勒索了20多万元美金的赎金，还给所谓‘破了案’的警备司令部送了更多的酬劳。”
    荣毅仁接着说：“国民党统治下的中国，黄浦江里停满了美国兵舰，美国货像海潮一样地涌来，我们的棉纺厂用的大部分是美国棉花，中国的工业破产，农村破产。马路上美国兵横冲直撞，北京的女学生被强奸。我父亲的实业救国的理想破灭了。就是我的爱人，虽然当时所想的只是如何过安乐的生活，但是作为一个中国人，能够容忍外国兵对自己同胞姊妹的污辱吗？那时，我们都希望有一个独立的强盛的祖国。而蒋介石国民党只会给祖国带来更多的屈辱。”
    荣毅仁问道：“谁来建设独立强盛的国家呢？当时我们并没有想到是共产党。”
    他接着说：“解放前夕，我们一家对于共产党的到来是感到惶恐的。我们几个兄弟中，有的跑到泰国去办工厂，有的躲到香港去了。我的父亲因为恨透了帝国主义和国民党，坚决不愿意离开祖国。我也不愿做白华，和他一道留下来了。我们企业的流动资金当时已经枯竭，解放以后又受到美国和国民党的封锁和轰炸。这个时期申新能够维持生产，全部依靠爱护民族工商业的中国共产党和人民政府的贷款、加工和收购，依靠职工群众的团结和积极生产。政府帮助我们建立了总管理处，统一领导过去分散经营的各个工厂，并且指导我们逐步改进经营管理。生产因此得到发展，纱锭的生产率提高了40％以上，从1951年起盈利逐年增加，1953年的盈利就达到资本总额的四分之一以上。初级的国家资本主义形式，就使我们的企业完全摆脱了解放初期的窘迫局面。而我弟弟在泰国办的工厂却破产了。”
    “重要的还在于解放以后6年来，国家强盛了。这是每一个从旧中国过来的中国人最感到骄傲的。我经常接触到共产党和人民政府的负责人，在经济最困难的时候，在局势最紧张的时候，党的每一次分析，党的每一个政策，毛主席的每一句话，周到又全面，稳重又果敢，说到了就做到了。农村土地改革的结果，棉花产量超过了历史上最高的水平，我们的纱厂不再依靠外国的棉花了。抗美援朝的胜利，打破了我们曾经有过的对帝国主义的畏惧。接着，五年计划开始了，全国兴建了许多大工厂，各地进行了大规模的建设，一切实现得比梦想还要快，多么令人鼓舞！没有共产党，不走社会主义的道路，那能有今天！”
    这时，记者插断了荣毅仁兴奋的谈话，要求他谈谈对社会主义的认识。
    荣毅仁接着说：“我受了6年的社会主义教育。1952年我到了莫斯科，还访问了苏联其他几个城市。我亲眼看到苏联工人的生活水平不但不比我国一般资本家差，而且还要好得多。对社会有更大贡献的人，生活过得比我还好。单从个人物质生活来看，社会主义对我们中国的资本家来说没有什么值得可怕的，相反还值得羡慕。再从生产上看，我们用不着拿社会主义的计划经济跟资本主义时期的盲目投机和互相倾轧来比较，只从工厂取消了对工人的搜身制一件事就可以看到社会主义的优越性。取消搜身制以后，工人的人格受到应有的尊重，几年来就极少有工人带东西出厂的事情发生。企业纳入国家资本主义，特别是实行公私合营以后，工人劳动热情大大提高，自觉地遵守劳动纪律。过去用罚、用开除的压迫手段做不到的事，改革了资本主义的旧制度就办到了。仅仅从这些方面，我就认识到资本主义的剥削关系非消灭不可。”
    记者进一步直率地问：消灭剥削，废除资本主义制度，对于你失去了什么？得到了什么？
    荣毅仁思索了一会，很快就答道：“对于我，失去的是我个人的一些剥削所得，它比起国家第一个五年计划的投资总额是多么渺小；得到的却是一个人人富裕、繁荣强盛的社会主义国家。对于我，失去的是剥削阶级人与人之间的尔虞我诈、互不信任；得到的是作为劳动人民的人与人之间的友爱和信任，而这是金钱所买不到的。因为我积极拥护共产党和人民政府，自愿接受改造，在工商界做了一些有利于社会主义的工作，我受到了政府的信任和人民的尊重，得到了荣誉和地位。从物质生活上看，实际上我并没有失去什么，我还是过得很好。”
    荣毅仁在将要结束自己的谈话的时候说道：“消灭剥削，建成繁荣富强的社会主义社会，是全国人民的愿望。”他指着坐在一起的孩子们笑着说：“他们有的要做音乐家，有的要做工程师，就是没有一个想做资本家。他们的前途，用不到我拿金钱去买。谁都认识到只有实行社会主义，走人人富裕的道路，中国才能够强盛繁荣。共产党和人民政府对民族资产阶级采取和平改造的方针，替我们安排了出路，经过一个公私合营的过程，培养和锻炼我们的技术和业务能力，支持我们有利于国家的社会政治活动，工作、学习和生活都得到很好的照顾。只要自己努力，完全可以成为光荣的社会主义社会的自食其力的劳动者。”
    当记者问到他现在的生活和将来的打算时，他笑着说：“几年来我从企业得到的利润收入，如果要我自己花掉，我实在没有办法花哩。我的企业已经实行公私合营，还准备实行定息的办法，这样每年利润更有了保证。我已经在上海市人民代表大会会议上表示了决心：我一定把所得的利润以投资企业和购买公债的方式，用来支援国家的建设。我个人愿意在任何工作岗位上来尽我的责任，做一个对国家、对社会主义有贡献的人。”
    在记者告辞以前，荣毅仁的全家人又围坐在一起，他把记者的谈话记录念了几段给他的夫人和孩子们听。
