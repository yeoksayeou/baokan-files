　　Let the Voice of Socialism Spread Across the Fields
　　By our reporter, Fu Dong
　　December 30th.
　　From early morning, the office of the Red Star Collective Farm in Beijing had a constant stream of people. The villagers crowded around the gray, wardrobe-like 500-watt loudspeaker, peering and gazing, reluctant to leave.
　　Today, the farm's wired broadcasting station officially began broadcasting. The villagers arrived early, each wanting to see how this strange thing could be so magically powerful, how it could be heard dozens of miles away with just a word.
　　Those who couldn't squeeze into the room were also discussing the radio in the courtyard meeting place. People talked about how the two young girls in the village, Liu Xiulan and Zhang Shumin, had learned to manage the broadcast machine in four hours. People also talked about how the 20 young villagers planted the telephone poles just like the workers, and some even spoke with gratitude about the Beijing Radio Station workers' enthusiasm in installing the broadcast machine a month ahead of schedule.
　　The sound of firecrackers rang out, and the chairman of the farm, Yu Chaokai, announced the start of the broadcasting ceremony.
　　"...From today onwards, we can hear major events happening in the city, the country, and the world every day through the loudspeaker." Comrade Yu Chaokai continued in an excited tone: "We can directly hear the instructions of leaders at all levels, and the advanced experiences of agricultural production from all over the country. Among our villagers, capable people with achievements can also talk to everyone through the loudspeaker about how they did it! What experience they have. ... This will greatly promote our production and raise our socialist consciousness."
　　Yu Chaokai had wanted to do this for a long time. The management of the farm was becoming more and more complex. The land had increased from 1,518 mu in 1952 to more than 29,000 mu, and the population had expanded from 63 households in 1952 to 1,360 households. There were almost daily matters to discuss with the villagers. But the roads in the village were getting longer and longer. It was a full 20 li to run from the east end of the village to the west end, and although it was a little closer from the south end to the north end, it still took 12 li. Yu Chaokai was very troubled by this. Many policy reports on current events should have been given to all the villagers, but because the villagers lived too far apart, it was difficult to gather them together and could only be given to the brigade leader. When there was a meeting to be held, the chairman, vice-chairman, general branch secretary, and production director all had to go out to notify. Some urgent matters were sometimes delayed like this. What was worse was that sometimes the meeting time was set, but if an emergency happened and the date had to be changed, there was no time to notify everyone. Some villagers who lived more than ten li away would come all the way only to find out that it was cancelled. This happened in mid-October. What was particularly bad was that a few days ago, when publicizing the "Three Fixes" policy, everything was explained clearly. But after a few days, a villager named Yan Jingchun said to others that the grain allocated to his family according to the regulations was not enough to eat. What was going on? It turned out that the person who conveyed the message to Yan only mentioned the average amount of grain for all the villagers, and did not say how to take care of the specific situation. There were too many facts like this.
　　Wouldn't all these problems be solved if we installed a loudspeaker like in a factory? In this way, the leaders and the masses could speak directly, saving the trouble of passing on messages from one person to another! Now that this wish has come true, how could Yu Chaokai not be excited!
　　Yu Chaokai continued in front of the microphone: "From the loudspeaker, we can also hear all kinds of dramas and folk arts and other cultural programs, enriching our cultural life." The villagers standing under the loudspeakers in various villages all laughed. Wasn't that right? Hadn't everyone listened to many plays during the trial broadcasts these past few days?
　　Wang Jinhua's family had many children, so they didn't go to listen under the loudspeaker. But she could hear very clearly sitting on the kang, every word as if it were spoken in her ear. While sewing cotton shoes and taking care of her children, she happily told others: "Look, I'm sitting on the warm kang, doing my work, and listening to the reports. The broadcast operas these days are really good, just like I went to a theater in Beijing!"
　　Bai Yizhen, a 77-year-old villager with a white beard, and his blind old wife, Liu Jinkui, were also happy to tell everyone about the loudspeaker: "We're old, but we've caught up with such a good society! We've never heard Mei Lanfang's plays in our lives, but now we've heard them!"
　　Comrades from the Beijing Radio Station presented the farm with a banner at the meeting. It read:
　　"Let the Voice of Socialism Spread Across the Fields!"
　　Yes, let all the rural areas install these loudspeakers! Let all the farmers sit on their kangs and hear about the major events happening in the city, the country, and the world!

### 让社会主义的声音传遍田野

　　让社会主义的声音传遍田野
    本报记者　傅冬
    12月30日。
    从一清早起，北京红星集体农庄办公室就没断过人。庄员们挤到那灰色的像个大衣柜子一样的五百瓦播音机跟前，东瞅瞅，西瞧瞧，不肯走开。
    今天农庄有线广播站正式播音。庄员们早早地就赶来了，人人都想看看这怪东西怎么那样神通广大？怎么能够一说话几十里外都可以听到。
    挤不到房里的庄员，在院里的会场上也在谈论广播的事。人们谈着：庄里的两个小丫头刘秀兰和张树敏怎样在四个钟头内学会了管理播音机。人们也谈着：庄里的20个青年庄员栽的电线杆子和工人栽的一模一样，有的人还用感激的口吻谈到了北京广播电台工人提前一个月把播音机装好的热情。
    鞭炮声响了，农庄主席于潮凯宣布播音典礼开始。
    “……从今天起，我们每天就可以从大喇叭里，听到全市、全国、全世界所发生的大事情。”于潮凯同志用兴奋的语调继续说：“我们可以直接听到各级首长给我们的指示，和全国各地农业生产的先进经验。我们庄员里，能干的有成绩的人也可以通过大喇叭，向大家说说他是怎样干的！有什么经验。……这对于推动我们的生产提高我们的社会主义觉悟有很大作用。”
    于潮凯好久以来就想办这件事。农庄的管理一天比一天复杂，土地由1952年的1，518亩增到29，000多亩，人口由1952年的63户扩大到1，360户，天天差不多都有事要和庄员们商量。可是庄里的道路却一天比一天长，从庄子的东头到西头足足要跑20里，从南头到北头虽然近一点，也得走个12里。于潮凯为这事伤透了脑筋。好多政策时事方面的报告，按理应向全体庄员讲，可是因为庄员住的太分散，不好召集，只能讲给大队长。遇着要开会的时候，主席、副主席、总支书记、生产主任四个人就都得出去通知。一些紧要的事有时就这样耽搁了。更糟的是，有时说好几点开会，临时发生 急事，要改期，可是来不及通知，有些住在十几里路以外的庄员老远地赶来扑个空，十月中就发生过这么一回事。特别糟糕的是前些天宣传“三定”政策的时候，讲得清清楚楚。可是过了没几天，一个叫阎景春的庄员对人说，按规定分给他家的粮食不够吃。这是怎么回事？原来向阎传达的人只说了个全庄庄员的粮食平均数，没说具体怎样照顾。像这样的事实在太多太多了。
    要是和工厂一样安一个大喇叭这些问题不都解决了吗？这样领导和群众不就可以直接说话，省得一道一道转话！而现在这个愿望实现了，这怎么不让于潮凯激动呢！
    于潮凯在播音机前接着说：“从大喇叭里，我们还能听到各种戏剧和曲艺等文艺节目，丰富我们的文化生活”，站在各个村里大喇叭下面听的庄员都笑了。可不是吗？这两天试播，大伙不是听了好多场戏吗？
    王金花一家子因为娃娃多，没有到大喇叭筒下面去听。可是她坐在炕头上听得很清楚，一字一句就像在她耳边说的。她一面缝着棉鞋一面照护娃娃，她高兴地对人说：“你看我坐在不冷不热的炕上把活作了，把报告听了。这几天广播大戏，播得真好，就跟我去了一趟北京的大戏院子一样！”
    77岁的白胡子老庄员白异珍和他的瞎了眼的老婆婆刘金奎也高兴得见人就说大喇叭的事：“老了老了，赶上这么好社会！一辈子没听过梅兰芳的戏，这一下也给听到了！”
    北京广播电台的同志在会上送给农庄一面锦旗。上面写着：
    “让社会主义的声音传遍田野！”
    是的，让所有的农村都安起这喇叭吧！让所有的农民坐在炕头上就听到全市、全国、全世界所发生的大事情！
