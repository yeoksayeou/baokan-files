The development of private elementary schools is very rapid throughout the country. According to statistics from 16 provinces (autonomous regions) and 3 municipalities directly under the central government, there are more than 22,800 private elementary schools, with more than 1,311,000 school-age children studying in them.

    The number of private elementary schools in Sichuan Province has increased 65 times compared to 1952. In Guizhou Province, there are an average of more than 50 private elementary schools in each county (city). In Xinghua and other counties in Jiangsu Province, some private elementary schools are already being run by agricultural producers' cooperatives. In the Alxa Banner of the Bayinhot Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province, herdsmen voluntarily contributed labor and materials to build 44 classrooms and made more than 100 sets of desks and chairs for the school.

    Some areas have also made plans for further development of private elementary schools. Pingyao County in Shanxi Province plans to ensure that 98% of school-age children in the county are enrolled by 1957. The number of students in private elementary schools in Fujian Province will increase to more than 229,000 this year, more than 5 times that of last year. (Xinhua News Agency)
