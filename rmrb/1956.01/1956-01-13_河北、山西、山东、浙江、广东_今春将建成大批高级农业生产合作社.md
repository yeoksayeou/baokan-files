    Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Zhejiang, Guangdong
    To Build a Large Number of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives This Spring
    (Our Newspaper) This spring, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Zhejiang, Guangdong and other provinces will build a large number of fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives.
    In Hebei Province, after basically completing the semi-socialist agricultural cooperation, more and more primary agricultural production cooperatives are requesting to be converted into advanced cooperatives. According to the plans recently determined by the local committees of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province at the village branch secretary meetings, 10,000 to 15,000 advanced agricultural production cooperatives will emerge in the province before spring plowing. According to the plan of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the province will basically achieve fully socialist agricultural cooperation in the spring of 1957.
    As of the 10th, Shanxi Province has built more than 2,000 advanced agricultural production cooperatives; more than 5,000 advanced cooperatives are being established or are being planned. The number of farmers participating in the primary stage agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province has reached 85.3% of the total number of farmers in the province. Old cooperatives that have been established for three to five years generally produce 60% to 70% more than before the establishment of the cooperative. The members of these old cooperatives are already feeling dissatisfied with the private ownership of land, draft animals, and other major means of production. Many cooperatives have gradually reduced the proportion of land dividends stipulated at the beginning of the cooperative establishment year by year, according to the situation of increasing cultivated land production year by year through labor processing, and some cooperatives have also implemented a lower fixed rent system or abolished land dividends.
    Shandong Province will pilot 3,000 fully socialist advanced agricultural production cooperatives before spring plowing, and the number of farmers participating in advanced cooperatives is expected to account for 9% of the total number of farmers in the province. In order to run these pilot advanced cooperatives well, so as to set up banners and create experience, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires leaders at all levels to personally take action and do a good job in the pilot work.
    There are more than 590 advanced agricultural production cooperatives that have been established and are being established in Zhejiang Province. More than 1,000 advanced cooperatives are being planned in various places. These newly established advanced cooperatives all have a history of two or three years of primary cooperatives, and production has been greatly developed. The recent year-end distribution results of the 63 advanced agricultural production cooperatives established before the first half of last year showed that more than 96% of the cooperatives increased production.
    Guangdong Province plans to establish 385 advanced agricultural production cooperatives before spring plowing, some of which have been built successively. This batch of advanced agricultural production cooperatives are all converted from primary cooperatives. About half of these cooperatives are distributed in the Pearl River Delta, the main grain-producing area in the province, and key counties with a good working foundation. According to the plan recently formulated by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, more than 3,400 advanced agricultural production cooperatives will be established in the province by the end of this year.

    河北、山西、山东、浙江、广东
    今春将建成大批高级农业生产合作社
    本报讯  河北、山西、山东、浙江、广东等省，今年春季将建成大批完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社。
    河北省在基本上完成半社会主义性质的农业合作化以后，初级农业生产合作社要求转办高级社的越来越多。根据中共河北省各地方委员会最近分别召开乡支部书记会议确定的计划，全省在春耕以前，将出现一万到15，000个高级农业生产合作社。根据中共河北省委员会的规划，全省将在1957年春天基本上实现完全社会主义性质的农业合作化。
    山西省到10日止，已经建成了两千多个高级农业生产合作社；正在建立和酝酿建立的高级社还有五千多个。山西省参加初级阶段农业生产合作社的农户已经占到全省农户总数的85.3％。建立三年到五年的老社，一般比建社前增产60％到70％。这些老社的社员，已经对于土地、耕畜等主要生产资料的私有制感觉到不满足。许多社已经依照劳动加工使耕地逐年增产的情况，把建社初期规定的土地分红比例逐年降低，有些社还实行较低的固定租额制或取消土地分红。
    山东省将于春耕以前试办三千个完全社会主义性质的高级农业生产合作社，参加高级社的农户预计将占全省总农户的9％。为了把试办的这些高级社办好，以便树立旗帜，创造经验，中共山东省委要求各级领导亲自动手，切实做好试办工作。
    浙江省已经建立和正在建立的高级农业生产合作社有590多个。各地正在筹建的高级社还有一千多个。这批新办的高级社都具有两三年初级社的历史，生产已有了很大发展。去年上半年以前建立的63个高级农业生产合作社最近年终分配的结果，有96％以上的社增产。
    广东省在春耕前计划建立385个高级农业生产合作社，其中有一部分已经先后建成。这一批高级农业生产合作社都是由初级社转办的。这些社约有半数以上分布在省内主要产粮区的珠江三角洲和工作基础较好的重点县。根据中共广东省委员会最近制定的计划，全省在今年年底将要办成3，400多个高级农业生产合作社。
