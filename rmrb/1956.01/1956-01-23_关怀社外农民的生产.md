Caring for the Production of Farmers Outside the Cooperative
Ji Xichen

In many villages that have basically achieved cooperativization, a small number of farmers have not yet joined the cooperative. Among them, some are temporarily unwilling to join due to their low level of awareness; others have not joined due to scattered residences or other reasons. Therefore, while leading the cooperatives, properly arranging the production of these farmers outside the cooperative is a problem that village Party branches must pay attention to.

The Waixi Township Party Branch in Xindu County, Sichuan Province, has adopted many methods to solve this problem. In order to strengthen the connection between Party members, cooperative members, and farmers outside the cooperative, the branch first criticized the discriminatory and exclusive thinking towards farmers outside the cooperative among Party members and cadres, so that everyone understood that "today's individual farmers are tomorrow's cooperative members." While organizing the cooperative for production, the branch helped farmers outside the cooperative arrange production. When the cooperative held production meetings, it absorbed farmers outside the cooperative to participate voluntarily. The cooperative also helped joint groups and mutual aid teams formulate production plans. In issuing loans, the branch and the cooperative both paid attention to taking care of farmers outside the cooperative.

For individual farmers who could not organize mutual aid teams due to being too scattered, the branch adopted the method of "linking" or "contracting" the cooperative with them. For example, the "May Fourth" Agricultural Cooperative, for three poor farmers outside the cooperative who lacked labor, farm tools, and livestock, adopted the method of contracting cultivation, planting, and harvesting under the condition of obtaining appropriate remuneration, to help these farmers overcome various difficulties in production. For wealthy farmers who were temporarily unwilling to join the cooperative and had difficulties in production, the "linking" method was adopted according to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and they signed cultivation contracts with the cooperative, and some also carried out exchange labor production with the cooperative. Because the cooperative solved the production difficulties of farmers outside the cooperative, it could prevent landlords and rich peasants from taking advantage of their difficulties to carry out exploitation and provoke relations between farmers. In this way, not only was the unity between the cooperative and farmers outside the cooperative consolidated, and the production sentiment of farmers outside the cooperative stabilized, but also the socialist enthusiasm of farmers outside the cooperative was continuously improved. Now, many of them are striving to join the cooperative.

Our Party's policy towards all farmers is to gradually guide them onto the socialist road of common prosperity. In order to achieve this goal, we must care for and help the small number of farmers who have not yet joined the cooperative in all aspects, and we should absolutely not discriminate against or even exclude them.

    关怀社外农民的生产
    纪希晨
    在不少基本上实现了合作化的乡村里，至今仍有一小部分农民没有加入合作社。他们之中，有的是由于觉悟不高，暂时还不愿加入；有的则由于居住分散，或其他原因还没有加入。因此在领导合作社的同时，对这些社外农民的生产加以妥善的安排，是乡村党支部必须注意的一个问题。
    四川省新都县外西乡党支部曾采用不少办法来解决这个问题。为了加强党员、社员和社外农民的联系，支部首先对党员和干部中的歧视和排斥社外农民的思想进行了批判，使大家了解了“今天的个体农民就是明天的合作社社员”。在组织合作社进行生产的同时，支部帮助社外农民安排生产。合作社召开生产会议的时候，吸收社外农民自愿参加。合作社并帮助联组、互助组制定生产计划。在发放贷款中，支部和合作社都注意对社外农民加以照顾。
    对于因居住过于分散组织不起互助组的个体农民，支部则采用合作社和他们“挂钩”、或者“包干”的办法。例如“五四”农业合作社对于三户缺乏劳力、农具和畜力的社外贫苦农民，在取得适当报酬的条件下，采用包耕、包种、包收的方法，帮助这些农民克服生产中的各种困难。对暂时不愿入社，生产又有困难的富裕农民，根据自愿互利的原则，采取“挂钩”办法，同合作社签订了耕作合同，也有的同合作社进行换工生产。由于合作社解决了社外农民生产上的困难，就可以防止地主富农利用他们的困难，进行剥削和挑拨农民之间的关系。这样，不但巩固了合作社和社外农民的团结，稳定了社外农民的生产情绪；而且不断地提高着社外农民的社会主义积极性。现在，他们之中，已有不少的人在争取入社。
    我们党对全体农民的政策，就是逐步地引导他们走社会主义共同富裕的道路。为了达到这一目的，对于少数还未入社的农民，就要从各方面关心帮助他们，绝对不应该歧视甚至排斥他们。
