The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region plans to reach the 1957 agricultural production targets ahead of schedule this year. This plan was determined in accordance with the spirit of completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and the needs of the rapidly progressing Lanxin Railway construction.

The Autonomous Region has good conditions to realize this plan. At present, there are more than 6,100 agricultural production cooperatives in the region, with farmer households joining the cooperatives accounting for 21.34% of all farmer households in the region. This year, a total of 8,500 cooperatives will be developed, which is the main force for promoting the upsurge in agricultural production. The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will expand its sown area by more than 69% this year compared with last year. The Production and Construction Corps widely adopts mechanized farming, which is the main part of the completely socialist economy in the Autonomous Region's agriculture. There is a lot of wasteland in the Autonomous Region, with abundant water sources. This year, the total sown area, including the replanting area, will increase by about 1.2 million mu compared with last year. Coupled with other yield-increasing technical measures, the average grain yield per mu in the region can be increased by more than 15 jin compared with last year, and the yield of cotton can be increased by more than 10 jin.

    新疆维吾尔自治区今年农业生产将达1957年指标
    新疆维吾尔自治区计划在今年提前达到1957年的农业生产指标。这个计划是根据提前完成第一个五年计划的精神和兰新铁路建设进展迅速的需要确定的。
    自治区有良好的条件实现这个计划。目前全区农业生产合作社已有6，100多个，入社农户占全区农户21.34％。今年共要发展到8，500个社，这是促进农业生产高涨的主要力量。中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队今年的播种面积，要比去年扩大69％多。生产建设部队广泛地采用机械耕作，是自治区农业中完全社会主义经济的主要部分。自治区境内荒地很多，水源丰富，今年播种总面积包括复种面积，将比去年增加约120万亩。加上其他的增产技术措施，就能使全区粮食平均每亩比去年增加15斤多，皮棉增加10斤多。　（新华社）
