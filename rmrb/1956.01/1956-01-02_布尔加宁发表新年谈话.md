Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 1st: According to TASS, Soviet Minister Council Chairman Bulganin, at the request of the British Broadcasting Engineering Corporation of Baidai Marconi, delivered a New Year's address to be broadcast to all listeners worldwide on January 1st.

　　Bulganin began his speech by wishing all listeners a Happy New Year. He then said that if we ask millions of people today what their most enduring wish is, they will most likely answer without hesitation: peace.

　　The people of all countries can and must live together peacefully and amicably. They want peace because peace will give people confidence in the future, free them from the heavy and unnecessary burden of armaments, and provide them with opportunities to work in peace and build a better life.

　　Bulganin said that with this in mind, we participated in the Geneva Conference of Heads of Government, which was of great significance for establishing mutual understanding and cooperation in order to reach mutually agreed agreements on outstanding international issues. During our recent visits to India, Burma, and Afghanistan, we became even more convinced that this path is correct. Our friendship with these countries and other countries is based on the well-known Five Principles.

　　We are deeply convinced that if all countries fulfill these principles, it will be an important step forward in strengthening trust between countries and easing international tensions.

　　We know that there are many obstacles and difficulties on this path, but we are convinced that as long as all countries have sincerity and a desire for peace, these obstacles and difficulties can be eliminated, and agreements can be reached on all pressing issues. There have been many such examples in the past year. Let us work even more persistently to ensure that 1956 successfully continues and builds on the achievements of previous years!

　　Let us wish in advance: May the new year be a year of further easing of tensions in international relations and a year of strengthening peace throughout the world.

　　布尔加宁发表新年谈话
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科1日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁应百代·马可尼法英广播工程公司的要求，发表了一篇新年谈话，以便在1月1日向全世界的所有听众广播。
    布尔加宁在谈话中首先祝贺所有的听众新年快乐。他接着说，如果今天我们问千百万人民，他们怀抱最久的愿望是什么，他们极可能会毫不犹豫地回答：和平。
    各国人民可以而且必须和平地和友好地相处，他们要和平，因为和平将使人对明天有信心，使他摆脱沉重的和不必要的军备负担，而且将为他提供在和平中工作和建设美好生活的机会。
    布尔加宁说，我们抱着这种想法参加了政府首脑日内瓦会议，这次会议对于建立相互谅解和合作以便就未决的国际问题达成一致同意的协议，有着非常重大的意义。我们在最近访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗期间，更加相信这条道路是正确的。我们同这些国家以及同其他国家的友谊是以大家都知道的五项原则为基础的。
    我们深信，如果一切国家都履行这些原则，这将成为在加强各国间的信任和缓和国际紧张局势的道路上前进的重要一步。
    我们知道，这条道路上存在着不少障碍和困难，但是我们坚信，只要一切国家有诚意和谋求和平的愿望，这些障碍和困难是可以消除的，而且是可以就一切迫切问题达成协议的。在过去一年中有许多这样的例子。让我们更加坚持不懈地努力，使1956年顺利地继续并且发扬以前各年所取得的成就罢！
    让我们预祝：新的一年将是国际关系中的紧张局势进一步缓和的一年，全世界的和平得到加强的一年。
