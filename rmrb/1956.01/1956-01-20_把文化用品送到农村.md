The Dezhou branch of the China General Merchandise Company in Shandong Province has recently transferred a large number of cultural supplies to the countryside in coordination with rural literacy work. They organized many delivery teams to go to the countryside, which was warmly welcomed by the vast number of peasants.

The Dezhou Department Store organized the delivery of cultural supplies to the countryside by adopting the method of delivering goods to the door according to different needs. When they arrived in the village, they first contacted the heads of the people's schools, clubs, and newspaper reading groups, and used the school and club's spare time to exhibit samples. They also used advertisements, slogans, and loudspeakers to introduce the prices and uses of various cultural supplies, so that everyone could choose satisfactory items. For example, the Jiyang County Department Store carried more than 30 kinds of inexpensive and practical cultural supplies suitable for rural needs to Qin Village in the Taiping District for exhibition, and sold more than 1,000 yuan worth of goods that day. Another example is that the delivery team of the Xiajin County Department Store, which is under its jurisdiction, carried more than 50 kinds of cultural supplies to an agricultural cooperative for exhibition and sold more than 400 yuan worth of goods in one day.

The advantage of the Dezhou Department Store's approach is that it not only expands the sales of cultural supplies, but also promotes rural literacy work.

    把文化用品送到农村
    中国百货公司山东省德州市分公司，配合农村的扫盲工作，最近，调运了大量的文化用品下乡，组织了很多送货小组到农村去受到了广大农民的热烈欢迎。
    德州市百货公司组织文化用品下乡，是采用按着不同需要送货上门的办法。他们到了村里，首先和民校、俱乐部、读报小组的负责人取得联系，并且利用学校和俱乐部有空的时间展览了样品，还利用广告、标语、喇叭介绍各种文化用品的价格和用途，使大家能选购到称心的东西。如济阳县百货公司携带了30多种物美价廉、适合农村需要的文化用品到太平区秦村去展览，当天就卖了1，000多元。又如所属夏津县百货公司下乡送货小组携带了50多种文化用品到一个农业合作社展览，一天就卖了400多元。
    德州市百货公司这样做的好处是，一方面扩大了文化用品的销售，一方面又推动了农村的扫盲工作。
