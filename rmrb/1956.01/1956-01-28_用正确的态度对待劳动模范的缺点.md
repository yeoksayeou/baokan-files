    Treat Labor Models' Shortcomings with the Correct Attitude
    Hao Jie
    In Yantai City, out of the original 26 labor models and advanced workers from 9 units including the Yantai Machine Tool Factory, Machine Factory, and Dyeing and Weaving Factory, 9 failed to be re-elected in the third quarter summary and evaluation last year. Two of the three well-known advanced groups in the city collapsed.
    Excessive social activities, being assigned to positions beyond their capabilities, and the transfer of key members from advanced groups all affected the labor models and advanced groups' ability to maintain their honors. However, the leadership's incorrect attitude towards the shortcomings and errors of labor models and advanced groups is a very important reason. For example, Tong Xianli, a Yantai City labor model and production team leader at the Yantai Machine Tool Factory, was relatively subjective and often did not accept the opinions of the masses. However, instead of patiently helping him overcome his shortcomings and improve his work, the factory's Party organization simply lectured and reprimanded him, and eventually transferred him away from production altogether. As a result, Tong Xianli not only failed to overcome his detachment from the masses but became even more detached.
    Another labor model, Lin Jibao, the deputy leader of the model group at the Yantai Ship Repair Factory, had his group produce defective products once. Instead of helping him explore the real reasons for the defects and improve his work, the factory leaders helped him cover up his mistakes in front of the masses. As a result, Lin Jibao's group had a similar accident not long after, causing a loss of more than 400 yuan to the state in one instance.
    It is impossible for labor models and advanced workers to have no shortcomings or make no mistakes. The key is for the Party, trade union, and youth league organizations, as well as the administrative leaders of the enterprises, to patiently educate them and help them consciously overcome their shortcomings and mistakes. Adopting an impatient attitude, reprimanding them, transferring their jobs, or helping them cover up their mistakes—all these incorrect practices are of no benefit to them and can only damage and ruin them.
    Labor models and advanced workers are the backbone of socialist construction. We should take great care to cherish and cultivate them, and patiently help them overcome their shortcomings and make progress. Only in this way can we continuously consolidate and expand the ranks of advanced producers and enable them to play a greater role in the cause of socialist construction.

    用正确的态度对待劳动模范的缺点
    郝洁
    烟台市机床厂、机器厂、染织厂等9个单位原有26名劳动模范和先进工作者，在去年第三季度总结评比中有9名落选了。全市闻名的三个先进小组有两个垮了台。
    社会活动过多，被安排在力不胜任的岗位上，先进小组中的骨干分子被调走，这些都影响了劳动模范和先进小组不能继续保持荣誉。但是，领导方面用错误的态度对待劳动模范和先进小组的缺点和错误，是其中一个很重要的原因。例如，烟台市劳动模范、烟台市机床厂的生产组长相同礼，比较主观，常常不接受群众的意见。但是，厂里的党组织不去耐心地帮助他克服缺点，改进工作，而是一味地教训、斥责他，最后干脆把他调离生产。这样做的结果，使相同礼不但没有克服脱离群众的作风，反而更加脱离了群众。
    另一个劳动模范、烟台市修船厂模型组副组长林基宝，他所领导的小组有一次出了废品。厂的领导人员不帮助他探讨产生废品的真正原因和改进工作的办法，而是帮助他在群众面前掩饰错误。结果没有多久，林基宝小组又发生了类似的事故，一次就给国家造成了400多元的损失。
    劳动模范和先进工作者，不可能没有缺点和不犯错误。关键在于企业的党、工会、青年团组织和行政领导要耐心教育他们，帮助他们自觉地克服缺点和错误。采取急躁的态度，训斥他们，调动他们的工作，或者帮助他们掩饰错误，这种种不正确的做法，对他们没有一点好处，只能够损坏和断送他们。
    劳动模范和先进工作者是社会主义建设的骨干。我们应该十分细心地爱护和培植他们，耐心地帮助他们克服缺点，求得进步。只有这样，我们才能不断地巩固和扩大先进生产者的队伍，使他们在社会主义建设事业中发挥更大的作用。
