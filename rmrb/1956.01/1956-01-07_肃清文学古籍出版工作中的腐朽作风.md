　　Eliminating Decadent Work Styles in the Publication of Classical Literature and Ancient Books
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    Under the guidance of the Party's correct policy towards the national literary heritage, the work of compiling, researching, and publishing classical literary works is developing day by day, and the interest of the general readership in reading classical literary works is also growing. The Literature and Ancient Books Publishing House has printed a number of famous classical literary works and related research materials, which has somewhat satisfied the needs of readers. However, the Literature and Ancient Books Publishing House has also published some books with little or no value without strict selection.

    In the "Origin of Reprinting Literary Classics," the three criteria stipulated by the Literature and Ancient Books Publishing House for selecting literary classics for reprinting are: "(1) Collections or separate collections of outstanding writers that are widely circulated and well-known to the world, and excellent selections or general collections; (2) Various works that can represent the characteristics and schools of thought of an era and reflect the social outlook and people's lives of an era; (3) Rare and unique copies with reference and research value that are rarely circulated." However, the publishing house did not adhere to these principles, but only valued the shadow-printed publication of "rare and unique copies" that the editors considered precious. From October 1954 to the present, the Literature and Ancient Books Publishing House has reprinted more than 30 titles, of which shadow-printed copies account for 29. As for whether these books meet the first two criteria, whether they are beneficial to the construction of a new socialist culture, and whether they truly have research and reference value, the publishing house does not seem to have seriously studied them. Of course, truly valuable ancient books and original manuscripts of authors should be shadow-printed and published. However, our emphasis on precious ancient books is essentially different from the ideological style of the feudal class and bourgeois hangers-on and collectors who play with "unique copies" and "secret books." The Literature and Ancient Books Publishing House is precisely treating this work with the latter attitude.

    Because of this, the publishing house disregarded the urgent needs of the broad masses and published some books that have no value at all, or very little value, such as "Supplement to the Journey to the West," "A Smile to Scatter," and "Miscellaneous Records of Jinling." They disregarded wasting state assets and shadow-printed and thread-bound some books that were not "unique or rare copies," and published them in large quantities.

    The publisher's violation of the "origin" principle is prominently manifested in the publication of reference books on the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber." The publishing house shadow-printed and thread-bound several books, including "Four Pine Hall Collection," "Green Smoke Small Window Collection," "Maozhai Poetry Manuscript," and "Spring Willow Hall Poetry Draft," and also added "publication instructions" that were unrealistic and even deceptive. For example, in the "publication instructions" of "Green Smoke Small Window Collection," there are these words: "There are 20 seven-character quatrains in the collection entitled 'Poem on Dream of the Red Chamber,' which everyone believes can be used as a reference for studying Dream of the Red Chamber." In fact, the author, Fucha Mingyi, did not truly understand Cao Xueqin, but only said a few things that others had said, such as "The dream of the Red Chamber is hazy and vague, I don't remember the picture of the golden hairpins, the past is fleeting, writing poems wins quiet work," etc. What value does this kind of boring groaning of feudal scholar-officials have as a "reference for studying Dream of the Red Chamber?" Does the "everyone" referred to in the "publication instructions" refer to the broad masses of readers and researchers who love classical literature, or to a small number of people who play with antiques and versions? As for the dozen or so poems in the other three books about Cao Xueqin's life and thoughts, they are helpful for understanding Cao Xueqin's life and thoughts. However, except for "Maozhai Poetry Manuscript," these three books are not "unique or secret copies," and it would be entirely possible to compile and print these ten or so poems. The publishing house did not do this, but under the domination of the bourgeois ideology of playing with "unique copies" and "secret books," it shadow-printed and promoted to readers even the useless and poisonous things in them without changing a single thing. In particular, those exaggerated "publication instructions" (similar "publication instructions" have also been written on the shadow-printed copies of "Strange Tales from a Lonely Studio," "Collection of Poems," and "Supplement to the Journey to the West," etc.) excessively and inappropriately boasted about the "value" of the versions, showing a completely irresponsible attitude towards readers and greatly damaging the due prestige of the national publishing agency.

    Although many ancient books are not needed by the general readership, they are valuable research materials for experts and specialized researchers. The publishing house can print them in small quantities for the exclusive use of libraries for preservation and for experts to refer to, and need not sell them to the general readership. What should be promoted to the general readership are classical works that they need, that are beneficial to them, and that are relatively easy for them to accept.

    For more than a year, bourgeois ideology in the field of classical literature research has been severely hit. However, this ideological style of playing with "unique copies" and "secret books" still occupies a position in the publication of classical literature and ancient books. It should be pointed out that the problems exposed by the Literature and Ancient Books Publishing House in its publishing work are by no means isolated or accidental. For example, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House published the "Complete Illustrations of Water Margin" with extreme imprudence. This is a collection of prints that is expensive (priced at 4.2 yuan) and beautifully bound, with both a preface and research papers, in which the writers vigorously promote the people's nature of the illustrations. However, there are many illustrations inside that distort and uglify the abused people and leaders of peasant uprisings, such as "Shi Xiu Shows His Mind," "Prison Car Escorts the Bandits," and "Execution of the Murderer in the West Market." Are these paintings also rich in the people's nature? In other publishing houses, there are also similar bad styles, which cannot be tolerated. National publishing agencies and all publishing houses willing to serve socialist cultural construction need to conduct thorough inspections and completely eliminate the bourgeois decadent ideology and style in publishing work, so that publishing work can more effectively serve the socialist cultural cause.

　　肃清文学古籍出版工作中的腐朽作风
    本报评论员
    在党对待民族文学遗产的正确方针指导之下，整理、研究和出版古典文学著作的工作日益开展，广大读者阅读古典文学作品的兴趣也跟着增长起来。文学古籍刊行社印行了不少古典文学名著和有关的研究资料，多少满足了读者的需要。但是，文学古籍刊行社也缺乏严格选择地出版了一些没有或者很少价值的书。
    在“重印文学古籍缘起”中，文学古籍刊行社所规定的选择重印文学古籍的三个标准是：“（一）流传最广而为世人所熟知的优秀作家的专集或别集，优秀的选集或总集；（二）能代表一时代文学的特色和流派、能反映一时代的社会面貌与人民生活的各种著作；（三）具有参考、研究价值，而流传极少的孤本和珍本。”但是，出版社并没有坚持这些原则，却只看重了在编者看来是宝贵的“孤本和珍本”的影印刊行工作。从1954年10月起到现在，文学古籍一共重印了30多种，其中影印的就占29种。至于这些书籍是否符合（一）（二）两项标准，是否对建设新的社会主义文化有益，是否真正具有研究参考价值，出版社似乎没有认真地加以研究。当然，真正有价值的古本、作者的原稿，是有必要影印出版的。不过，我们重视珍贵的古籍，是和封建阶级和资产阶级的清客和收藏家玩弄“孤本”“秘笈”的思想作风有本质的区别的。而文学古籍刊行社却正是以后一种态度来对待这一工作。
    正因为这样，出版社才不顾广大群众的迫切需要，将一些根本没有什么价值，或者价值很少的书籍，例如“西游补”、“一笑散”、“金陵琐事”等出版了。他们不顾浪费国家资财，将一些并非“孤本珍本”的书籍加以影印线装，大量刊行。
    出版社违背“缘起”原则的作法突出地表现在关于研究红楼梦的参考书籍的出版工作上。出版社把“四松堂集”、“绿烟琐窗集”、“懋斋诗钞”、“春柳堂诗稿”几部书，影印线装，而且还加上了不切合实际的、甚至带有欺骗性质的“出版说明”。例如在“绿烟琐窗集”的“出版说明”中有这些字句：“集中七绝有‘题红楼梦’诗20首，大家认为可作研究红楼梦的参考。”实际上作者富察明义并没有真正了解曹雪芹，只是说了几句人云亦云的话，什么“红楼春梦好模糊，不记金钗正幅图，往事风流真一瞬，题诗赢得静工夫”等等。这种封建士大夫的无聊的呻吟，究竟有什么“可作研究红楼梦的参考”的价值呢？“出版说明”所指的“大家”究竟是指广大的爱好古典文学的读者和研究者，还是指那些玩弄古董和版本的少数人呢？至于其他三本书中有关曹雪芹身世思想的十几首诗，对了解曹雪芹的身世思想有一定的帮助。但是这三本书除“懋斋诗钞”外，都并不是“孤本”“秘笈”，完全可以将这十多首诗辑录排印出来。出版社不这样做，却在玩弄“孤本”“秘笈”的资产阶级思想支配下，连其中没用的、有毒的东西也都原封不动地影印出来向读者推销。尤其是那些夸张的“出版说明”（类似的“出版说明”也曾写在“聊斋志异”、“诗集传”、“西游补”等书的影印本上）过份地、极不恰当地吹捧版本的“价值”，表现了对读者完全不负责任的态度，大大损害了国家出版机关的应有的威信。
    有许多古籍虽则不为广大读者所需要，但是对于专家和专门研究者说来，它们是有价值的研究材料。出版社可以把它们作少量的印行，专供图书馆保藏和专家参考之用，而可以不用向广大读者销行。向广大读者推销的应当是他们所需要的、对他们有益的、也比较容易为他们所接受的古典作品。
    一年多以来，古典文学研究工作领域中的资产阶级思想已受到了严重的打击。然而，这种玩弄“孤本”“秘笈”的思想作风，在文学古籍出版工作中却仍然占有阵地。应当指出，文学古籍刊行社在出版工作中所暴露出来的问题，绝不是个别的、偶然的。例如人民美术出版社极不慎重地出版了“水浒全传插图”，这是一本价格昂贵（定价4.2元）和装订精美的版画集，既有前言，又有研究性的论文，执笔者大肆鼓吹插画的人民性。可是里面却有不少像“石秀明心迹”、“囚车解草寇”、“西市剐元凶”等歪曲和丑化被虐杀的人民和农民起义军领袖的插画。难道这些画也是富有人民性的吗？在其他的出版社里，也还有类似的坏作风，这是不能容忍的事。国家出版机关和一切愿意为社会主义文化建设服务的出版社，都有必要通过深入的检查，彻底肃清出版工作中的资产阶级的腐朽思想和作风，使出版工作更有效地为社会主义文化事业服务。
