　　Marching Towards New Victories with Full Confidence
    Voroshilov's New Year's Message

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS, Moscow, January 1st: Kliment Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, delivered a New Year's message to the Soviet people.

    Voroshilov said that in the past year of 1955, many significant events occurred. It was a year of actively and successfully striving to strengthen peace. In this year, the Soviet people achieved great labor victories—successfully completing the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Under the leadership of the great Communist Party, the great Soviet people have made their motherland stronger and better year by year through their constructive labor.

    Entering 1956, the Soviet people not only think of the achievements already made, but also of the unresolved tasks, of fighting to eliminate existing shortcomings, and of further developing communist construction. The glorious Communist Party calls on the Soviet people to redouble their efforts to develop heavy industry more successfully, ensure the continuous new growth of socialist agriculture, expand the production of consumer goods, increase labor productivity, build more housing and cultural institutions, and ensure the further growth of the welfare of our people.

    Speaking of the international situation, Voroshilov said that the Soviet Union has shown itself to be a bulwark of world peace with particular force in the past year. The Soviet Union's active peace policy has played an extremely important role in exposing the maintainers of the "Cold War," in easing international tensions, and in significantly clearing away the war clouds in the international atmosphere.

    Major events such as the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference and the Bandung Conference have had a positive impact on consolidating peace and expanding economic and cultural cooperation between the peoples of all countries. Although the subsequent Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference failed to reach an agreement due to the position of Western countries, the spirit of Geneva still lives in the hearts of the people of all countries. The people of the world are increasingly actively demanding a halt to the arms race and a ban on atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    The unbreakable fraternal friendship between the working people of the Soviet Union and the people of the great People's Republic of China, as well as the people of the entire socialist democratic camp, is developing year by year.

    The Soviet people warmly welcome the normalization of relations between our country and the fraternal Yugoslav people who are building the foundations of socialism.

    Voroshilov said that our country is welcoming the New Year on the eve of the momentous 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In this regard, we can express our deep conviction that our heroic people—the builders of communism—will achieve new and greater successes in economic and cultural construction in the New Year.

    Ho Chi Minh's New Year's Message

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Hanoi: President Ho Chi Minh delivered a New Year's message to the Vietnamese people and overseas Vietnamese.

    In his New Year's message, President Ho Chi Minh reviewed the domestic and international situation of the past year and pointed out that in the New Year, the governments and peoples of all peace-loving countries in the world must make greater efforts to consolidate peace and develop the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. For the people of Vietnam and the people of Cambodia and Laos, it is necessary to further unite in order to fight against the interference of American imperialism, fully implement the Geneva Accords, and bring true peace to Indochina.

    President Ho Chi Minh pointed out the following tasks to the entire Vietnamese people:

    1. All the people must unite closely and resolutely carry out the political struggle to realize the program of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, demand the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords, and demand that the South Vietnamese authorities must consult with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to realize the unification of the country on the basis of independence and democracy.

    2. The people of North Vietnam must work hard to consolidate North Vietnam in all aspects, complete the land reform well, strive to produce and save, implement the 1956 plan for economic recovery and cultural development, continue to consolidate national defense, protect order and security, and suppress saboteurs.

    3. Strengthen solidarity with the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries; strengthen friendship with neighboring countries such as Cambodia, Laos, India, Burma, and Indonesia; and strengthen solidarity with the French people and the people of the world to defend peace.

    Pieck's New Year's Broadcast

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Berlin, January 1st: Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, said in his New Year's broadcast speech: The past year has shown more clearly than ever before that the peaceful forces of the people are stronger than the forces of the imperialist warmongers. Through the Warsaw Pact and the treaty signed with the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Republic has become an equal partner of the most powerful countries in the world.

    Pieck said that the industrial production of the German Democratic Republic has more than doubled compared with 1936. In the past five years, the living standards of the people have greatly improved.

    Pieck pointed out that in the Second Five-Year Plan, coal, electricity, metallurgy, chemicals, building materials, and machinery manufacturing must be given top priority, and agriculture and animal husbandry must also be greatly increased.

    Pieck finally expressed his belief that the people's just cause will surely triumph over the militarists.

    Bulganin Holds New Year's Reception

    Xinhua News Agency, January 1st, dispatch from TASS, Moscow: Nikolai Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, held a grand New Year's reception at the Grand Kremlin Palace on the evening of December 31st, attended by 1,500 people.

    Among those present at the reception were: Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Kliment Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich, Alexei Kirichenko, Georgy Malenkov, Anastas Mikoyan, Vyacheslav Molotov, Mikhail Pervukhin, Maxim Saburov, Mikhail Suslov, Nikita Khrushchev, and others.

    Also present at the reception were: Ministers of various departments of the Soviet government, Marshals of the Soviet Union, senior generals of the Soviet Army, social figures, scientists, cultural and artistic workers, and production innovators.

    Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Moscow also attended the reception.

    New Year's Eve in Moscow

    A thick snow coat is draped over Moscow. The towers and battlements of the Kremlin, the streets and squares, and the branches of birch and linden trees are all covered with white snow. Snowflakes hit the glass of house windows and car windows, forming various translucent and beautiful patterns. People walking on the road unconsciously take deep breaths, wishing they could inhale this particularly pure Russian winter scenery into their chests.

    The cold of nearly 20 degrees Celsius below zero is nothing to Muscovites. There are even more people coming and going on the streets than usual. The subway stations are almost open all night. The service hours of public transportation and shops are extended. The shops are particularly crowded. People are buying the last batch of Christmas tree lights, Father Frosts, toys for children, gifts for relatives and friends, and New Year's food. Many temporary telegram receiving stations have been added in post and telecommunications branches and subway stations. It is estimated that Muscovites will send and receive more than 1.5 million New Year's telegrams today alone.

    Winter nights come early. At five o'clock in the afternoon, Moscow has already put on a pearl shirt woven from millions of electric lights. On every holiday, the power of electrification is especially felt in Moscow. The first turbine of the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydropower Station generated electricity at 17:18 on the 29th. The future of Moscow's electricity use is truly limitless.

    Tonight, every home, every club, every theater is brightly lit. Many people go to the theater. Many people take their children to the Trade Union Building. The tall New Year's fir tree in the columnar hall of the Trade Union Building attracts thousands of children. They participate in various New Year's games around the vertical tree, emitting bursts of joyful laughter. Countless families with children have New Year's fir trees decorated with lights and colors.

    This is a sleepless night. Children play around the fir tree and their relatives. Every family is "staying up" until New Year's Day at tables filled with sumptuous food. People are raising their glasses to bid farewell to the last moments of 1955. As glorious Soviet people, how can they not cherish this year of 1955, which marks the further rise of Soviet power and international prestige? As glorious Muscovites, how can they not think of the role they have played in the overall national effort? It is precisely today that many steelworkers in Moscow have refined many steels using rapid steelmaking methods; Shu Minin, a lathe operator at the "Red Proletarian" factory, is processing at a speed of 2,000 revolutions per minute on a new lathe; Bushuyev, an advanced worker at the Stalin Automobile Factory, completed five years of production in one year....

    Late at night, the Kremlin clock tower strikes 12 times. The clear chimes and the solemn and sonorous Soviet national anthem are broadcast on the radio. The New Year has come to the side of the Muscovites from the fishermen on Sakhalin Island, the collective farmers by Lake Baikal, and the workers of the Urals. At this moment, many people raise their glasses to wish each other: "Happy New Year!" Some Soviet and Chinese friends who are spending the New Year together clink their glasses at this moment and say: May the unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship, an important factor for world peace, be further developed!

　　满怀信心走向新的胜利
    伏罗希洛夫的新年祝词
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科1日讯　苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫向苏联人民发表了新年祝词。
    伏罗希洛夫说，在过去的1955年中，发生了许多意义重大的事件，它是积极和成功地为加强和平而进行斗争的一年，苏联人民在这一年中获得了巨大的劳动胜利——成功地提前完成了第五个五年计划。伟大的苏联人民在共产党的领导下，以自己的建设性劳动使祖国一年比一年强大，一年比一年美好。
    在进入1956年的时候，苏联人民不只是想到已经取得的成就，而且还想到未解决的任务，想到要为消除现有缺点而斗争，想到要进一步发展共产主义建设。光荣的共产党号召苏联人加倍努力，争取更成功地发展重工业，保证社会主义农业不断得到新的增长，扩大消费品生产，提高劳动生产率，更多地建筑住宅和文化生活机关，保证我国人民的福利进一步增长。
    伏罗希洛夫在谈到国际形势时说，苏联在过去的一年中特别有力地表现出自己是世界和平的堡垒，苏联的积极的和平政策在揭露“冷战”的维护者，在缓和国际紧张局势，在明显地廓清国际气氛中的战争乌云方面起了极其重要的作用。
    像日内瓦四大国政府首脑会议、万隆会议这些重大的事件，都对巩固和平和扩大各国人民间的经济和文化合作有良好的影响。虽然随后的四国外交部长会议由于西方国家的立场而没有达成协议，但是，日内瓦精神仍然活在各国人民心中。全世界人民正在越来越积极地要求停止军备竞赛，禁止原子武器和氢武器。
    苏联劳动人民同伟大的中华人民共和国的人民，以及整个社会主义民主阵营的人民间的牢不可破的兄弟友谊在一年年地发展。
    苏联人民热烈欢迎我国同正在建设社会主义基础的兄弟的南斯拉夫人民之间关系的正常化。
    伏罗希洛夫说，我们的国家在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会这一意义重大的事件前夕迎接新年。在这方面我们可以表示深信：我国英雄的人民——共产主义建设者将在新的一年中在经济和文化建设方面获得新的、更大的成就。
    胡志明的新年祝词
    据新华社河内讯　胡志明主席发表了给越南人民和国外越侨的新年祝词。
    胡志明主席在新年祝词中回顾了过去一年中的国内外情势，并且指出，在新的一年中，世界爱好和平的各国政府和人民要作更大的努力以巩固和平和发展和平共处的五项原则。对越南人民和柬埔寨、老挝两国人民来说，要进一步团结起来以便进行斗争，反对美帝国主义的干涉，充分履行日内瓦协定，并且给印度支那带来真正的和平。
    胡志明主席向全体越南人民指出下列的任务：
    一、全体人民紧密团结、坚决进行政治斗争，实现越南祖国战线纲领，要求正确执行日内瓦协定，要求南越当局必须同越南民主共和国政府协商，以便在独立和民主的基础上实现国家的统一。
    二、越南北方人民必须努力在各方面巩固北越，要良好地完成土地改革，努力生产节约，实现1956年恢复经济和发展文化计划，继续巩固国防，保卫秩序和安宁，镇压破坏分子。
    三、加强同苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家的团结；加强同柬埔寨、老挝、印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚等邻邦国家的友谊；加强同法国人民和世界人民的团结以保卫和平。
    皮克的新年广播
    据新华社柏林1日电　德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克在新年广播演说里说：过去的一年比以前更加清楚地说明，人民的和平力量比帝国主义战争贩子的力量要强大。通过华沙条约，通过同中华人民共和国签订的条约，德意志民主共和国已成为世界上最强有力的国家的平等的合作者。
    皮克说，德意志民主共和国的工业生产已经比1936年增加一倍。过去五年，人民的生活水平大大提高。
    皮克指出，在第二个五年计划中，煤、电力、冶金、化学、建筑材料和机器制造业要放在第一位，农业和畜牧饲养也要大大增产。
    皮克最后表示相信人民的正义事业一定会战胜军国主义者。
    布尔加宁举行新年招待会
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁12月31日晚间在大克里姆林宫举行了有1，500人参加的盛大新年招待会。
    出席招待会的有：苏联共产党和政府的领导人伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇、基里钦科、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛、萨布罗夫、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫等。
    出席招待会的还有：苏联政府各部部长、苏联元帅、苏军高级将领、社会人士、科学家、文化艺术工作者和生产革新者。
    各国驻莫斯科外交使节也出席了招待会。
    莫斯科的除夕
    厚厚的雪袄披挂在莫斯科身上。克里姆林宫的塔楼和墙垛上，街道和广场上，白桦和菩提树枝上，都盖满白雪。雪花打在房窗和汽车窗的玻璃上，结成各种半透明的美丽图案。走在路上的人们不自觉地深深地呼吸着，恨不得把这特别洁净的俄罗斯冬天景色吸进胸腑。
    零下近20度的寒冷对莫斯科人不算什么一回事。街上来往的人们比平常还多。地下电车站几乎通宵不闭。公共交通和商店的服务时间延长了。商店特别拥挤。人们在购买最后一批给儿童的枞树灯、寒老人、玩具，给亲友的礼物和过年的食品。在邮电分局和地下电车站添设了许多临时接收电报站。据估计，仅仅今天莫斯科人收发的贺年电报将有150万件以上。
    冬夜来得早。下午五点钟，莫斯科已经换上千百万盏电灯结织的珍珠衫了。每逢节日，在莫斯科格外感觉到电气化的威力。世界最大的古比雪夫水电站的第一部透平在29日17点18分发电了。莫斯科将来用电的前途真是无止境。
    今晚，每个家，每个俱乐部，每个戏院，都是灯光辉煌。不少人上戏院去。许多人带着儿童到工会大厦。工会大厦圆柱大厅的高大新年枞树吸引着数以千计的儿童。他们围绕纵树参加各种新年游戏，发出一阵阵欢乐的笑声。无数有小孩的家庭里都出现了披灯挂彩的新年枞树。
    这是不眠的夜晚。小孩们嬉戏在枞树和亲人的身边。家家都在摆满丰盛食品的桌边“守夜”到元旦。人们在举杯送别1955年的最后时刻。作为光荣的苏联人，他们怎么能不惜别这个标志着苏联国力和国际威信进一步高涨的1955年。作为光荣的莫斯科人，他们怎么能不想起自己在全国总的努力中所起的作用呢？正是今天，莫斯科许多炼钢工人又炼出许多用快速炼钢法炼出的钢；“红色无产阶级”工厂镟工舒米宁在新式车床上以每分钟二千转的速度进行加工；斯大林汽车制造厂先进工人布舒也夫在一年中完成了五年产量……。
    深夜，克里姆林宫钟楼敲打12下。无线电广播传出这清晰的钟声和庄严响亮的苏联国歌。新年已经从库页岛上的渔人，贝加尔湖边的集体农民，乌拉尔的工人那里来临莫斯科人的身旁。许多人们在这个时刻举杯互祝：“新年好！”有些在一起过年的苏联和中国朋友在这个时刻碰着杯说：祝世界和平的重要因素——牢不可破的中苏友谊进一步发展！
