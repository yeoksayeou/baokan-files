　　Yunnan Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region is Progressing
　　Wang Ke
　　The Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region (equivalent to an autonomous prefecture level) in the southwestern border of China's Yunnan Province is a beautiful and rich place. It has large fertile plains, producing excellent rice. The mountainous areas are covered with dense forests, which not only produce timber but also abundant pasture, exporting thousands of yellow cattle and water buffalo every year. The region enjoys a mild climate and abundant rainfall throughout the year, and subtropical plants such as kapok, coffee, lac, and sugarcane grow well. The region has a total population of 400,000, including 150,000 Dai people, 80,000 Jingpo people, 140,000 Han people, and more than 20,000 people of other ethnic groups such as the Lisu. In recent years, the region has developed relatively rapidly in politics, economy, and culture. In July 1953, the Autonomous Region People's Government was established, realizing the right of the people of all ethnic groups to be masters of their own affairs. More than 800 cadres of local ethnic origin have now been trained, accounting for approximately 30% of the total number of cadres in the region. More than 100 ethnic cadres have joined the Communist Party of China. In the ethnic regional autonomous organs and other leading departments at all levels, a considerable number of ethnic cadres are shouldering major leadership responsibilities. In order to further realize the nationalization of ethnic regional autonomous organs, the Autonomous Region Party Committee plans to train and promote a new batch of ethnic cadres within one or two years to enrich various work departments, while also promoting some outstanding ethnic cadres to leading positions in the Party and government.
　　After full preparation, land reform was basically completed last year in areas inhabited by the Dai and Han ethnic groups with a total population of 250,000, using peaceful consultation. The feudal land exploitation system in the aforementioned areas was abolished, and the system of peasant land ownership was implemented. More than 100,000 landless and land-poor peasants were distributed land. During the land reform, Party branches were generally established, and nearly 900 outstanding members of the Dai and other minority ethnic peasants were absorbed into the Communist Party of China, strengthening the ties between the Party and the minority ethnic masses. During the land reform, township people's committees with poor peasant components as the core were also established, the mass armed forces were consolidated and developed, and public leaders of minority ethnic groups with ties to the people were further united and educated. Following the end of land reform, the agricultural cooperation movement was launched immediately.
　　Social reforms in the Jingpo and Lisu ethnic regions, whose socio-economic structure is not entirely the same as that of the Dai ethnic group, are now being actively prepared. The three Jingpo agricultural production cooperatives that have been piloted throughout the region have achieved preliminary experience. Undoubtedly, these minority ethnic groups with relatively backward socio-economic development will gradually and rapidly develop with the strong help and support of the state, after some necessary social democratic reforms.
　　The development of cultural education and health undertakings in the Autonomous Region has also made significant achievements. According to 1954 statistics, the region already had 143 primary schools with 14,000 students; two middle schools with 329 students. There are two well-equipped ethnic hospitals, four county health centers, five district health clinics, three maternal and child health stations, three various epidemic prevention stations, and 332 health and medical personnel.
　　The Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region has very superior natural conditions and great production potential. After the realization of agricultural cooperation, the productive forces will develop rapidly, and the material and cultural life of the people will also be rapidly improved. Not long ago, the Autonomous Region Party Committee, based on the specific conditions of the Autonomous Region and the requirements of the national plan, put forward a preliminary overall plan for the next seven years. According to this plan, agricultural cooperation in the areas where land reform has already been carried out will be basically completed by 1957. Grain production will reach 600 million catties by 1962. By then, the region will have an average of 1,500 catties of grain per person. There are also plans to greatly develop subtropical industrial crops. The total output value of grain and industrial crops will increase more than threefold compared to now. In addition, two mechanized farms and seven demonstration farms will be established. In terms of local industry, a total of 16 local state-owned factories will be established by 1962, including power plants, coffee factories, tea factories, lac factories, farm tool factories, leather factories, sugar and wine factories, vermicelli factories, brick and tile factories, and coal mines. After these factories are built, the industrial output value of the Autonomous Region will account for 36% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the region. There will be more than 3,000 workers of all ethnic groups. According to this plan, the reform of the old scripts of the Dai, Jingpo, and Lisu ethnic groups will also be completed in the next seven years, and illiteracy among adults will be basically eliminated. Undoubtedly, after the implementation of this plan, the economic and cultural life of the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region will be fundamentally changed.

　　云南德宏傣族景颇族自治区在进步中
    王克
    祖国西南边境的云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治区（相当自治州级），是个美丽富饶的地方。境内有大片肥沃的平坝，盛产优良的大米。有林木茂密的山区，不但盛产木材，还有丰富的牧草，每年输出的黄牛、水牛有数千头。境内全年气候温和，雨水充沛，木棉、咖啡、紫胶、甘蔗等亚热带植物生长良好。全区共有40万人口，其中傣族15万，景颇族八万，汉族14万，此外还有傈僳族等二万多人。几年来，这个地区在政治、经济和文化各方面的发展是比较迅速的。1953年7月成立了自治区人民政府，实现了各族人民当家作主的权利。现在已经培养了当地民族出身的干部八百多名，约占全区干部总数的30％。有一百多名民族干部已经加入中国共产党。民族区域自治机关及其他各级领导部门中，都有相当数量的民族干部担负着主要的领导工作。自治区党委为了进一步实现民族区域自治机关的民族化，计划在一两年内再培养、提拔一批新的民族干部，充实各种工作部门，同时把一些优秀的民族干部提拔到党和政府的领导岗位上来。
    经过充分的准备，去年在傣族和汉族等民族聚居的共有25万人口的地区，用和平协商方式基本上完成了土地改革。废除了上述地区的封建的土地剥削制度，实行了农民的土地所有制度。有十万多无地少地农民分得了土地。在土地改革中普遍建立了党的支部，吸收了将近九百名傣族及其他少数民族农民中的优秀分子参加了中国共产党，使党同少数民族群众的联系更加密切了。在土地改革中还建立了以贫农成分为核心的乡人民委员会，巩固和发展了群众武装，进一步团结和教育了少数民族中同人民群众有联系的公众领袖人物。在土地改革结束以后，就紧跟着开展了农业合作化运动。
    社会经济结构同傣族不完全相同的景颇族、傈僳族地区的社会改革，现在正积极地进行准备。全区已经试办的三个景颇族的农业生产合作社，取得了初步的经验。无疑的，这些社会经济发展比较落后的少数民族，在国家大力帮助和扶植下，经过一些必要的社会民主改革，将会逐步地迅速地发展起来。
    自治区文化教育和卫生事业的发展也有了显著的成绩。据1954年的统计，全区已有小学校143所，学生14，000人；中学二所，学生329人。有设备比较完备的民族医院二所，县卫生院四所，区卫生所五个，妇幼保健站三个，各种防疫站三个，有卫生医务人员332人。
    德宏傣族景颇族自治区由于自然条件十分优越，生产潜力很大。农业合作化实现以后，生产力将会很快地发展起来，人民的物质和文化生活也将会得到很快的改善和提高。不久以前，自治区党委根据自治区的具体情况和国家计划的要求，提出了今后七年初步的全面规划。按照这个规划，1957年将基本上完成已经进行了土地改革地区的农业合作化。粮食生产到1962年将达到六亿斤。到那时候，全区每人平均有粮食1，500斤。还计划大量发展亚热带技术作物。粮食和技术作物的生产总值将比现在增长三倍多。此外还要建立两个机耕农场和七个示范农场。地方工业方面，到1962年共将建立起地方国营工厂16个，包括发电厂、咖啡制造厂、制茶厂、紫胶制造厂、农具厂、皮革厂、糖酒厂、粉丝厂、砖瓦厂、煤矿等。这些工厂建成以后，自治区的工业产值将占全区工农业总产值的36％。并将有各民族的工人三千多人。按照这个规划，在今后七年内还将完成傣族、景颇族和傈僳族旧有文字的改革工作，并基本上扫除成年人中的文盲。无疑的这个计划实现以后，将从根本上改变自治区各族人民的经济和文化生活的面貌。
