    Strengthening Specific Leadership in Eliminating Illiteracy

    Since the beginning of winter, the masses' enthusiasm for learning culture has reached an unprecedented high. The number of enrollments in many places has greatly exceeded that of previous years. More and more intellectuals have joined the movement to eliminate illiteracy, and many counties and districts are confident that they will eliminate illiteracy within five, four, or even two years. This shows that with the upsurge of the agricultural cooperation movement, a magnificent mass movement to march towards culture is gradually unfolding throughout the country.

    However, it must be noted that the elimination of illiteracy in many places is still progressing very slowly, the enrollment plan has not been completed, and many specific problems in the elimination of illiteracy have not been resolved in time. Therefore, party committees at all levels must immediately strengthen specific leadership in the elimination of illiteracy, quickly transmit the new spirit of accelerating the elimination of illiteracy to grassroots organizations, incorporate the elimination of illiteracy into the overall work plan, carry out more extensive publicity and mobilization, organize more people to enroll in schools, overcome the negative and conservative emotions of some cadres, and earnestly solve specific problems in the elimination of illiteracy.

    There are currently two situations in rural areas: one is that the agricultural cooperation movement drives various tasks in rural areas, which promotes the elimination of illiteracy and other tasks. In turn, the elimination of illiteracy promotes the development of agricultural cooperation. The other is to engage in agricultural cooperation in isolation, squeezing out other tasks, including the elimination of illiteracy. Those in the former situation can achieve "three no delays" in building societies, production, and learning. Those in the latter situation will find contradictions between central work and learning. Many places are still in the latter situation, and class time and meeting time have not been arranged in a unified manner, and private school teachers cannot concentrate on teaching. This situation must be changed. Various tasks in rural areas, including the elimination of illiteracy, must be unified and arranged. In the future, the time for learning and meetings should be gradually fixed, with a fixed meeting time every week to ensure that the masses use most of their spare time for learning, ensuring no less than 20 evenings per month. Some specific matters can be raised and discussed with the masses before and after class, and should not occupy class time casually. Regular meetings are often attended by a small number of people, and it is wrong to hinder the learning of the majority because of meetings for a small number of people and should be avoided. Due to the development of agricultural cooperation and other tasks, the need for grassroots cadres has increased, the ranks of voluntary teachers in private schools need to be supplemented by intellectuals, and the heads of agricultural production cooperatives, production team leaders, accountants, and technicians also need to be supplemented by intellectuals. Therefore, it is also necessary to uniformly arrange the work of intellectuals in the townships to meet the needs of all aspects. Uniformly arranging work, production, learning, and manpower is a problem that urgently needs to be solved in the current elimination of illiteracy.

    The cadres and party and league members at the grassroots level have the most urgent need to learn culture, and this part of the illiterate should also be eliminated as soon as possible. Their participation in cultural learning has a great role in promoting the elimination of illiteracy. Because the masses learn culture as they do other work, they often look at the example of the cadres, so the cadres must take the lead. When the cadres participate in learning, they will also take the initiative to find ways to solve the conflict between learning and meeting time and other aspects. However, at present, many places have few cadres participating in learning, and those who participate in learning often miss classes and do not perform well in their studies. This is a very abnormal phenomenon. Party organizations should earnestly help them solve the difficulties in learning, reduce excessive concurrent jobs and reduce excessive meetings. For some cadres who are particularly busy with work, they can implement the method of separate classes for cadres and guaranteed teaching and learning.

    At present, the number of people who sign up for school in various places is very enthusiastic, but in many places, the number of people who actually enroll and can attend classes regularly accounts for only about half of the number of applicants. This is not because the masses are not active in learning, but because the leadership has not solved many specific problems in the elimination of illiteracy in a timely manner. By the end of December 1955, 53 private schools in the 12th District of Fei County, Shandong Province, had not started classes due to a lack of textbooks, 92 schools had not started classes because they had no houses, 109 schools had not started classes because they lacked private school teachers, and 32 schools had not started classes because other difficulties had not been resolved in time, totaling 286 schools. As a result, nearly 10,000 people in this district should have been able to enroll but could not. Isn't this situation serious? All localities should immediately take measures to solve the specific problems in the elimination of illiteracy, so that everyone who can go to school can go to school. At present, many places are calling for a shortage of teachers on the one hand, but on the other hand, they have not organized all the educated youth to form a strong army for eliminating illiteracy, so that many educated youth are idle and have nothing to do. Shandong and Jilin provinces have solved this problem relatively well. They widely organized youth literacy teams, which is a very good form. This form can unite the scattered rural educated youth, enable them to assume a certain amount of literacy work according to their abilities, and enable them to play their role more effectively. This can solve the difficulty of teachers in eliminating illiteracy. This experience should be widely promoted.

    Farmers cannot learn culture without textbooks. If the textbook is compiled one day late, the elimination of illiteracy will be delayed by one day. At present, the work of compiling textbooks in many places is still too slow. The county and district party committees should urge rural work cadres, primary school teachers, and all literate people to help the cooperatives compile textbooks for recording work points and learning characters, and the county and province should also quickly compile the second and third textbooks. This is an extremely important task in carrying out the movement to eliminate illiteracy.

    The elimination of illiteracy should have an overall plan. With an overall plan, we can know how many illiterate people have been eliminated in the region, how many illiterate people are still there, how much literacy power there is, what difficulties there are, when the illiterate can be completely eliminated, and how many should be eliminated each year, so that cadres and the masses know what's going on. The purpose of making a plan is to promote work. Winter is the most important learning season for farmers. We should organize the masses to enroll in school while planning, and do not wait until the plan is made before starting to eliminate illiteracy, so as not to miss the opportunity.

    At present, the masses have a high enthusiasm for learning, and it is possible to eliminate illiteracy in the country within 7 years. We must immediately strengthen the specific leadership in the elimination of illiteracy, so that the problems discovered in the movement to eliminate illiteracy can be solved in a timely manner. Within 7 years, to eliminate more than 300 million illiterate people left over from the old society is one of our greatest historical tasks. We should strive to complete and complete this task ahead of schedule, so that the cultural level of our people can adapt to the needs of the ever-developing industry, agriculture and other aspects, and promote the accelerated development of socialist construction.

### 加强扫除文盲工作的具体领导

    加强扫除文盲工作的具体领导
    入冬以来，广大群众学习文化的热情空前高涨，许多地方的入学人数大大地超过了往年，愈来愈多的知识分子投入了扫除文盲的运动中去，不少县区已经有把握要在五年、四年甚至两年之内扫除文盲。这说明随着农业合作化运动高潮的到来，一个规模壮阔的向文化进军的群众运动也在全国范围内逐步展开了。
    但是，必须看到，目前许多地方的扫除文盲工作进展得还非常迟缓，入学计划没有完成，扫除文盲工作中的许多具体问题没有及时解决。因此，各级党委必须立即加强扫除文盲工作的具体领导，把加速扫除文盲的新精神迅速地传达到基层组织中去，把扫除文盲工作纳入整个工作规划，开展更广泛的宣传动员工作，组织更多的群众入学，克服一部分干部中的消极保守情绪，认真解决扫除文盲工作中的具体问题。
    现在农村当中有两种情况：一种是通过农业合作化运动带动农村中的各项工作，这样就把扫除文盲工作和其他工作都推动起来了，而扫除文盲工作反过来又促进了农业合作化的发展。一种是孤立地搞农业合作化，把其他工作包括扫除文盲工作通通挤掉了。凡是处在前一种情况的，建社、生产和学习就可以做到三不误。凡是处于后一种情况的，中心工作和学习就会发生矛盾。现在有许多地方还是处于后一种情况，上课和开会的时间没有作统一的安排，民校教师不能集中力量于教学工作。这种情况必须改变。农村的各项工作，包括扫除文盲在内，必须加以统一安排。今后应当使学习和开会的时间逐步固定起来，每周有一个固定的开会时间，保证群众的业余时间大部分用来学习，做到每月不少于20个晚上。有些具体事情可以在课前课后提出和群众商量的，就不要随便占用上课的时间。经常性的会议，往往是少数人开的，因少数人开会而妨碍大多数人学习是不对的，应当避免。由于农业合作化和其他工作的发展，基层干部的需要量增加了，民校的义务教师的队伍需要知识分子补充，农业生产合作社的社长、生产队长、会计、技术员也需要知识分子补充，因此又必须统一安排在乡知识分子的工作，以满足各方面的需要。对工作、生产、学习和人力进行统一安排，这是目前扫除文盲工作迫切要求解决的问题。
    基层干部和党员团员中的文盲，学习文化的要求最迫切，这部分文盲也应当尽早扫除。他们参加文化学习，对扫除文盲工作有很大的推动作用。因为群众学习文化也和做其他工作一样，常常要看干部的样子，所以也必须干部带头。而干部参加了学习，也就会主动地设法解决学习和会议的时间冲突问题以及其他方面的问题。但是目前许多地方的干部参加学习的很少，而参加学习的也经常缺课，学习成绩不好，这是很不正常的现象。党的组织应当切实地帮助他们解决学习中的困难，减轻过多的兼职和减少过多的会议，对一部分工作特别繁忙的干部，可以实行干部单独编班和包教保学的办法。
    目前各地报名入学的人数很踊跃，但许多地方真正入学和能够经常上课的却只占报名数的一半左右，这并不是因为群众学习不积极，而是因为领导方面对扫除文盲工作的许多具体问题解决得不及时。山东省费县第十二区全区的民校，到1955年12月底，因为缺乏课本而没有开学的有53所，因为没有房子不能开学的有92所，因为缺乏民校教师不能开学的有109所，因为其他困难没有及时解决而不能开学的还有32所，共达286所。结果，这一个区就有近万人应该入学而不能入学。这种情况还不严重吗？各地应当立即采取措施，解决扫除文盲工作中的具体问题，使一切可以上学的人都能上学。现在许多地方一方面喊叫缺少教师，另一方面却又没有把所有的知识青年组织起来，形成一支强有力的扫除文盲大军，以致许多知识青年闲着无事可作。这个问题，山东、吉林等省解决得比较好。他们广泛组织青年扫盲队，这是一个很好的形式。这种形式可以把分散的农村知识青年团结起来，使他们根据自己的能力担负一定的扫除文盲的工作，能够更有效地发挥他们的作用。这样就可以解决扫除文盲工作中的师资困难。这个经验应当普遍推广。
    农民学文化不能没有课本，课本迟编一天，扫除文盲工作就多耽误一天。现在许多地方编课本的工作还进行得太迟缓，党的县委、区委应当督促农村工作干部、小学教师和一切识字的人帮助合作社编出记工识字课本，县和省也要迅速编出第二第三本课本。这是开展扫除文盲运动的一项极重要的工作。
    扫除文盲工作应当有全面规划。有了全面规划，就能知道本地区已经扫除了多少文盲，还有多少文盲，有多大的扫除文盲力量，有哪些困难，什么时候可以把文盲扫除完毕，每年应当扫除多少，使干部和群众心里都有底。订规划是为了推动工作，冬季是农民最主要的学习季节，应当一面规划，一面组织群众入学，不要等到订好了规划再动手扫除文盲，以致错过时机。
    目前，群众的学习热情很高，全国文盲有可能在7年之内扫除。必须立即加强对扫除文盲工作的具体领导，使扫除文盲运动中发现的问题能够及时得到解决。在7年之内，扫除旧社会遗留下来的3亿以上的文盲，这是我们最伟大的历史任务之一。我们应当争取完成和提早完成这个任务，使我国人民的文化水平能够适应日益发展的工业、农业等各方面的需要，促进社会主义建设事业的加快发展。
