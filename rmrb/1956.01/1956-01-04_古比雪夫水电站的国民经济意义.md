The National Economic Significance of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station
    By F. Lyaboshapko, Director of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, USSR

    When, at the end of October 1955, the largest river in Europe – the Volga – was completely and thoroughly dammed in its most powerful middle reaches, the most important stage of the construction of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, the largest in the world to date, was completed. It is not difficult to imagine the complexity and enormity of this project when one considers that at the moment of damming the river, the water flow reached 3,700 to 4,000 cubic meters per second, and the flow velocity was five to six meters per second. The general characteristic of the past stage of construction of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station is the enormous amount of work completed. For example, earthwork was nearly 120 million cubic meters, more than five million cubic meters of concrete and reinforced concrete were poured, nearly 350,000 tons of metal structures and reinforcing steel were installed, and so on. To grasp an idea of this unparalleled hydroelectric station with 20 generating units, each with a capacity of 105,000 kilowatts, it is enough to note that the foundation of the power plant building is 30 meters below the bed of the Volga River. The height of the hydroelectric station building is over 80 meters.
    The damming of the Volga enabled us to put the first two generating units of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station into operation before the end of 1955, generating the first batch of electricity for industrial use. We also undertook the socialist task of putting the third generating unit into production when the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union opened in Moscow in February 1956.
    The truly enormous national economic significance of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, as stated in the directives of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, lies in the fact that it is the most important construction of the Five-Year Plan. Once the full capacity of the hydroelectric station is put into production, it will be able to generate more than 11 billion kilowatt-hours of cheap electricity annually.
    The government decision on the construction of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, published on August 21, 1950, stated: "...prescribing the allocation of electricity from the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station as follows: (1) 6.1 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity will be transmitted to the city of Moscow annually; (2) 2.4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity will be transmitted to the regions of the cities of Kuibyshev and Saratov annually; (3) 1.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity will be transmitted annually for irrigating the land on the east bank of the Volga River." It must be pointed out that the initial design capacity of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station originally stipulated 10 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity to be generated annually in years of normal water volume, which is 600,000 kilowatts more than the entire national electrification plan stipulated by the State Commission for Electrification of Russia (GOELRO) 35 years ago—in 1920.
    To transmit electricity from Kuibyshev to Moscow, the Kuibyshev-Moscow high-voltage transmission line, unprecedented in terms of both length and voltage, was erected. Electricity at a voltage of 400,000 volts will be transmitted over a distance of more than eight hundred kilometers. The high-voltage line replaces the tens of thousands of train cars needed to transport coal for thermal power plants to produce the same amount of electricity.
    After the dam of the Kuibyshev hydro-junction is completed, the water level of the Volga River near the dam will rise by 26 meters.
    The rise in river water will extend six hundred kilometers upstream and increase the river surface by 30 to 40 kilometers in width. This enormous reservoir will change the face of the Volga River region. It makes it possible to develop shipping more rapidly in the future.
    Fish farming will be extensively developed. It should be pointed out that in the construction of the future sea bed, machine operators, soil improvement technicians, and fish farmers have all shown special concern for establishing fishing grounds.
    The Kuibyshev hydro-junction will create conditions for drastically increasing the yield per unit area of land on the east bank of the Volga River. Millions of hectares of land will be irrigated. The fertility of the soil will be greatly increased. The harvest of grain crops will be greatly increased, and there will be unlimited possibilities for expanding the planting area and increasing the yield per unit area of melons and vegetables. Orchards will be all over the grasslands on the east bank of the Volga River.
    Electricity-driven tractors and combine harvesters will be widely used in the fields. Engines on livestock farms will minimize the labor of livestock workers to the greatest extent and make labor productivity reach a very high level. Electric milking machines and electric shearing machines will be widely used.
    The electricity from the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station will make the face of the collective farm countryside unrecognizable. Electricity will firmly enter the daily life of collective farmers, not only as a source of lighting, but also as a power source for a large number of electric household appliances. Thanks to the electricity generated by the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, a new batch of rural cultural centers, cinemas, and television equipment will appear in the villages along the Volga River.
    More than five years since construction began, the face of both banks of the Volga River has become unrecognizable. Some new cities and towns have appeared in the construction area—Zhigulevsk, New Stavropol, Komsomoli, Port, Shlyuz, etc., which were relocated from the flooded areas. Wharves, large granaries, ship repair enterprises, and many other enterprises are under construction near Komsomoli. Some enterprises that will use the electricity of the hydroelectric station are under construction in the construction area.
    During the construction of the Kuibyshev hydro-junction, the oil industry has developed in the Tatar Autonomous Republic, in the neighboring area of the hydro-junction. To further increase the exploration and extraction volume of oil, Tatar oil workers will receive electricity from the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station.
    Double-track railways and motor roads are being laid near the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station. The hydroelectric station will provide a large amount of electricity to railway transportation. Steam locomotives and internal combustion locomotives will be replaced by electric locomotives here. Changing trains to electrical guidance will not only improve operating conditions, but also greatly improve the economic indicators of the railway.
    It is not difficult to imagine how huge a step our industry, agriculture and culture will take forward along the road of further development, thanks to the abundant and inexpensive electricity given to the motherland by the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station.

　　古比雪夫水电站的国民经济意义
    苏联古比雪夫水电站站长　弗·利雅鲍沙普科
    当1955年10月底欧洲最大的河流——伏尔加河在它水势最大的中流被完全地、彻底地拦断的时候，世界上迄今最大的古比雪夫水电站建设的最重要阶段就已经完成了。只要想到在拦断河流的时刻，水的流量达到每秒3，700到四千立方公尺，而流速是每秒五到六公尺，就不难想像这个工程之复杂和巨大。古比雪夫水电站建设的过去一个阶段的总的特点是所完成的工作量十分巨大。例如，土方工作差不多有12，000万公方。浇灌混凝土和钢筋混凝土五百多万公方。安装金属结构和钢筋近35万吨，以及其他等等。为了对这个拥有20个各有105，000瓩发电能力的无与伦比的联动机组的水电站得出一个概念，只要注意到，水电站的厂房的基础是在低于伏尔加河河底30公尺的地方。水电站建筑的高度在80公尺以上。
    拦断伏尔加河使我们能够在1955年年终以前使古比雪夫水电站头两部联动机组开动，发出第一批工业用电。我们还担负了在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会于1956年2月在莫斯科开幕的时候使第三部联动机组投入生产的社会主义任务。
    古比雪夫水电站的真正巨大的国民经济意义，正如苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的指示中所称的，在于它是五年计划的最重要的建筑。水电站的全部能力投入生产以后，每年就能从水电站得到110亿度以上的廉价的电力。
    在1950年8月21日公布的政府关于建设古比雪夫水电站的决定中写道：“……规定古比雪夫水电站的电力分配如下：（一）每年向莫斯科市输送61亿度电力；（二）每年向古比雪夫市和萨拉托夫市区域输送24亿度电力；（三）每年输送15亿度电力用于灌溉伏尔加河东岸的土地。”必须指出，古比雪夫水电站的初步设计能力原规定水量通常的年份每年发电一百亿度，比35年前—1920年时全俄电气化委员会的整个国家电气化计划所规定的发电能力还要大60万瓩。
    为了把电力从古比雪夫输送到莫斯科，架设了无论从长度和电压说来都是空前未有的古比雪夫—莫斯科高压输电线。在八百多公里的距离上将传送着40万伏特电压的电流。高压线代替着为生产同量电力的热电站运煤所需的成千上万的车厢。
    在古比雪夫水利枢纽的堤坝建成以后，靠近堤坝的伏尔加河的水位将上升26公尺。
    河水的上升将向河流上游扩展六百公里，并使河面增加30到40公里宽。这个巨大的水库将改变伏尔加河沿岸地区的面貌。它使将来更加迅速地发展航运成为可能。
    养鱼业将得到广泛的发展。应当指出，在建设未来的海的底床时，机器操使者、土壤改良技师和养鱼家都对建立捕鱼地段表现了特殊的关怀。
    古比雪夫水利枢纽将为急剧提高伏尔加河东岸田地的单位面积产量创造条件。千百万公顷的土地将受到灌溉。土壤的肥力将大大提高。谷类作物的收获量将大大增加，瓜菜作物播种面积的扩大和它们的单位面积产量的提高也将得到无限的可能性。伏尔加河东岸的草原上将遍布果园。
    在田野上将广泛地使用电力带动的拖拉机和收割联合机。饲畜场上的发动机将最大限度地减轻畜牧工作者的劳动，并使劳动生产率达到很高的程度。电力挤奶机、电力剪毛机将被广泛运用。
    古比雪夫水电站的电力将使集体农庄乡村的面貌变得无从辨认。电力将巩固地进入集体农民的日常生活中，不仅作为照明的源泉，并且是为数众多的电动日用器具的动力。由于古比雪夫水电站发出的电力，在伏尔加河沿岸的村庄上将出现一批新的农村文化馆、电影院、电视设备。
    在开始建设以来五年多的今天，伏尔加河两岸的面貌已经变得无法辨认了。在建设地区出现了一些新的城市和村镇——从被淹没地区迁出的日古列夫斯克、新斯塔夫罗波里、康索莫里、波尔特、什留兹等等。康索莫里附近正在建筑码头、大谷仓、修船企业以及许多其他的企业。在建设地区正在建筑一些将利用水电站的电力工作的企业。
    在古比雪夫水利枢纽的建设期间，在水利枢纽的邻近地区，在鞑靼自治共和国，石油工业有了发展。为了进一步增加石油的勘探和采取量，鞑靼的石油工作者会得到古比雪夫水电站的电力。
    在古比雪夫水电站附近铺设铁路复线和汽车路。水电站将给予铁路运输以大量的电力。这里蒸汽机车和内燃机车将换成电气机车。列车改为电气导引不仅会改善经营条件，并且可以大大提高铁路的经济指标。
    不难想像，由于古比雪夫水电站给予祖国的丰富而低廉的电力，我们的工业、农业和文化将沿着进一步发展的道路向前迈进多么巨大的一步。
