Eliminating Backwardness and Promoting Progress is the Responsibility of Leadership

In recent years, various enterprises in all industrial sectors have made efforts and progress in increasing production, improving quality, reducing costs, increasing labor productivity, and trial-manufacturing and producing new products. However, it should be pointed out that the current situation of all enterprises is not satisfactory. Some enterprises have made rapid progress, while others have made slow or little progress; some have reached higher targets and quotas, while others have failed to reach them, or have fallen far short, remaining at a backward level. This situation should arouse serious attention from the leading organs of all industrial departments, as well as the Party and trade unions.

Here are a few examples from the light industry sector: Among the paper mills affiliated with the Ministry of Light Industry, the unit cost of producing offset printing paper at the Shiyan Paper Mill is 672.69 yuan, while at the Jilin Paper Mill it is 1,104.73 yuan. Among the soap manufacturing factories affiliated with the Ministry of Light Industry, the fatty acid recovery rate at the Tianjin Grease Chemical Plant is 75.3% (according to materials from January to September 1955), while Shanghai factories can generally achieve a recovery rate of over 99%. (The Tianjin plant uses soapstock as raw material, but the recovery rate should not differ so greatly.) Among local state-owned enterprises, the qualification rate of five-pound thermos bottle liners produced by the Suzhou Glass Factory is 93.84%, while the rate at the Dalian Glass Factory is only 81.8% (according to November 1955 materials).

Similar situations exist in other industrial sectors. For example, an important method of increasing cement production is to improve the safe operation cycle of cement kilns. In this regard, from 1950 to the end of 1954, the shortest safe operation period of cement kilns at the state-owned Guangzhou Cement Plant was 136 days, and the longest reached 367 days. In 1954 alone, the plant increased cement production by 3,000 tons for the state and saved a large amount of repair costs due to long-term safe operation. However, the average safe operation cycle of other state-owned cement plants nationwide was only 43.9 days in 1954, and only 38.5 days in the first half of 1955.

There are two different attitudes towards this situation.

One attitude is to tolerate backwardness, finding various reasons to justify it. For example, there are statements such as: "Although this enterprise is currently backward, it has improved a lot compared to previous years," "Given the conditions of this enterprise, reaching such targets is already very good," and so on.

The other attitude is the opposite of the first, believing that backwardness can and should be eliminated. Since the production of one enterprise can reach advanced targets and levels, enterprises with similar production conditions should also be able to reach the same targets and levels through effort. If the conditions are different, then the conditions that hinder production development should be changed as much as possible, and conditions that are conducive to production development should be created.

Leaders must choose one of these two attitudes. This is a question of where the leader stands. If the leader does not see or value advanced things, and tolerates backward things, then he is not placing himself at an advanced level, but at a backward level. As everyone knows, leadership that places itself at a backward level is right-leaning conservative leadership, which is tantamount to canceling leadership and abandoning leadership. Only by placing oneself at an advanced level, promoting backward things to catch up with and surpass the advanced, is correct leadership, strong leadership. This is true in all work, and it should certainly be true in leading industrial production.

Currently, not all leaders in various industrial departments can always adopt this correct attitude clearly and firmly. Facts have proven that if leaders do not support advanced things and do not criticize backward things; or even if they support them and criticize them, but their support is weak and their criticism is weak, then backward phenomena will persist for a long time, and the speed of industrial development will be affected. Facts have also proven that if leaders earnestly study the reasons why advanced enterprises are advanced and the reasons why backward enterprises are backward, truly and effectively, vigorously reward the advanced and spur on the backward, fully promote and rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and create various conditions to enable the backward to catch up with and surpass the advanced, then things will be completely different. Various enterprises will develop vigorously, and not only will the backward be able to progress, but the advanced will also be able to continue to strive for progress.

What are the reasons for the backward phenomena in some enterprises?

The relatively backward production of some enterprises can be said to be caused by some objective conditions, such as old and poor technical equipment, long distances to raw material sources, high freight costs, and poor raw material quality, and so on. However, these objective conditions are not unchangeable. In order to change these conditions as much as possible, leaders often need to take a series of basic measures, such as coordinating with relevant parties to establish nearby raw material bases and improve raw material quality, and earnestly studying how to maximize the effectiveness of existing machines. In some cases, old machines should be replaced with new machines. It is wrong not to replace old machines that are too old and have greatly hindered production and safety, and to always use backward equipment when conditions permit the use of new machines. Some people believe that since backwardness is caused by objective conditions, there is nothing that can be done about it, so they do not try to change conditions that can be changed, which is of course completely wrong.

However, a more common reason for backwardness in production lies in the backwardness of enterprise management. Some enterprises have good objective conditions, but due to poor production management, financial management, and technical management, the enthusiasm and creativity of employees have not been brought into play, leading to backwardness in production. Some enterprises have both objective difficulties and relax the improvement of management work, which further deepens the backwardness. There is no reason why enterprises with backward management cannot strive to improve their management level and learn from advanced enterprises. In this regard, the responsibility of the leading organs of various industrial departments, as well as the Party and trade unions, is to use practical and effective methods to promote advanced experience, and vigorously urge backward units to learn; to make backward units feel a pressure to move forward. It is an abnormal phenomenon if backward units can still be content and go their own way. Conversely, it is a normal phenomenon in our social system for those who are backward to feel uneasy and feel that if they do not catch up quickly, they will be in danger of being eliminated.

In order to completely change the conservative style of rewarding the good but not criticizing the bad, all industrial departments must conduct serious supervision and inspection of their affiliated enterprises. Appropriate rewards should be given to units and individuals who are truly advanced in technical reforms, production management, and operation. Necessary criticisms should be given to some units and individuals who are persistently conservative and backward. Those leaders who insist on being backward and cause significant losses should be given certain punishments. When an advanced unit is discovered within an industrial system, inspection and summarization should be carried out immediately, the experience of the advanced unit should be promoted, advanced individuals should be sent to backward units to teach, or backward units should send people to advanced units to learn, and a deadline should be set for learning. Various industrial departments should immediately and seriously summarize the effective advanced experience of their departments, and make plans to send people to help them in accordance with different situations, and set a deadline for the affiliated enterprises to learn well; extensive inter-factory competitions in the same industry and inter-work competitions in the same type of work should be carried out, and mass competitions should be used as an important method to encourage the advanced and eliminate the backward. In these tasks, Party and trade union organizations must mobilize the masses to work together with the administrative aspects of various industrial departments and enterprises, and fully promote the socialist enthusiasm of the workers and masses. Local newspapers should also strengthen publicity and criticism in this regard. Only by abandoning the lazy and conservative style and implementing a resolute socialist style can we get things done quickly and well.

Eliminating backwardness and making the backward catch up with the advanced is not a one-time event. In the development of social life, there are always advanced things and backward things. The law of development of socialist society is to constantly use the advanced to drive the backward in the struggle between the advanced and the backward, and the backward constantly catch up with the advanced. Today's high standard is advanced, and tomorrow's higher standard will be advanced. Our social productive forces are developing forward day by day in this way, and our social life is progressing forward day by day in this way. Therefore, constantly promoting advanced experience, and constantly using advanced levels to require the backward to catch up closely, is a leadership method that conforms to the law of development of socialist society. Only such leadership is not leadership divorced from the masses, but leadership that is closely integrated with the masses and can encourage the masses to move forward. We are now working hard to accelerate the socialist construction of our country, and we must learn this leadership method.

    消除落后推动前进是领导的责任
    近几年来，各工业部门的各个企业在增加产量、提高质量、降低成本、提高劳动生产率、试制和生产新产品等等方面都作了努力，有了进步。但是应该指出，并不是所有的企业的现状都是令人满意的。有的企业进步得很快，有的企业进步得很慢很少；有的达到了较高的指标和定额，有的则达不到，或者差得很远，而停留在落后的水平上。这种情形应当引起各工业部门以及党和工会的领导机关的严重注意。
    这里举几个轻工业部门的例子：在轻工业部所属各造纸厂中，石砚造纸厂制造胶版印刷纸单位成本为672.69元，而吉林造纸厂则为1，104.73元。在轻工业部所属各制造肥皂的工厂中，天津油脂化学厂的脂肪酸回收率是75.3％（据1955年1月到9月间的材料），而上海各厂却能一般做到99％以上的回收率。（天津厂是用皂脚做原料，但回收率也不应相差这样大。）地方国营企业中，苏州玻璃厂所制五磅热水瓶胆合格率为93.84％，而旅大玻璃厂就只有81.8％（据1955年11月份材料）。
    在其他工业部门也有这种情形。如水泥工业增加生产的一个重要方法，是提高水泥窑的安全运转周期，在这方面，国营广州水泥厂从1950年到1954年底，水泥窑安全运转期最低的为136天，最高的达到367天；在1954年一年中，这个厂由于长期安全运转给国家增产了3，000吨水泥，并节省了大量的修理费。可是全国其他的国营水泥厂，在1954年平均的安全运转周期只达到43.9天，1955年上半年只达到38.5天。
    对待这种情形，可以有两种不同的态度。
    一种态度是容忍落后，找出种种理由来为落后辩护，例如有这种种说法：“这个企业虽然现在落后，但比前几年总算已经提高很多了”，“按照这个企业的条件，达到这样的指标已经很不错了”，等等。
    另一种态度同前一种态度恰恰相反，认为落后现象是可以消除和应当消除的：既然有一个企业的生产能够达到先进的指标和水平，那么生产条件类似的企业也一定能够经过努力达到同样的指标和水平；如果条件不同，那么就应当尽可能改变那种阻碍生产发展的条件，创造有利于生产发展的条件。
    领导者必须从这两种态度中选择一种态度。这是领导者站在什么位置上的问题。领导者如果看不见或不重视先进的事物，而容忍落后的事物，那就不是把自己的位置摆在先进的水平上，而是摆在落后的水平上。大家知道，把自己的位置摆在落后的水平上的领导就是右倾保守主义的领导，也就是取消领导，放弃领导。只有把自己的位置摆在先进的水平上，促进落后的事物赶上并超过先进，才是正确的领导，强有力的领导。在一切工作中都是这样，在领导工业生产中当然也应当是这样。
    现在各工业部门的领导并不都能够常常是明确坚定地采取这种正确的态度。事实证明，如果领导者不支持先进的事物，不批判落后的事物；或者虽然支持了，批判了，但支持得很软弱，批判得很软弱，那么落后现象就会长期存在，而工业发展的速度就会受到影响。事实也证明，如果领导者认真去研究先进企业之所以先进的原因，落后企业之所以落后的原因，切切实实地，雷厉风行地奖励先进，鞭策落后，充分地发扬和依靠群众的积极性和创造性，并且创造各种条件使落后的能够赶上并超过先进，那么，事情就会完全是两个样子。各个企业就会生气勃勃地向前发展，不但落后的能够进步，而且先进的也能够继续争取进步。
    造成某些企业中的落后现象的原因究竟在那里呢？
    有些企业生产比较落后，可以说是由于一些属于客观条件的原因造成的，例如技术装备较旧、较差，原材料的来源距离远，运费高，原材料质量较差，等等。但是，这些客观条件并不是不可以改变的。为了尽可能改变这种条件，往往需要领导者采取一系列的基本措施，如协同有关方面尽可能地建立距离较近的原料基地和改进原料质量，以及切实研究怎样发挥现有机器的最大效能等，有的并且应当用新机器来代替旧机器。对于一些过于老旧已经在很大程度上妨碍了生产和安全的旧机器，必须有计划地加以改换，在有条件改用新机器的时候不改换，永远使用落后的设备是不对的。有人认为，落后既然是客观条件造成的，那就无能为力，因而明明可以改变的条件也不去设法改变，这当然是完全错误的。
    但是，生产上落后的更普遍的原因是在于企业管理工作的落后。有些企业客观条件很好，但由于对生产管理、财务管理、技术管理做得不好，职工的积极性创造性没有发挥出来，以至在生产上落后。有些企业既有客观困难又放松了管理工作的改进，那就更加深了落后。使管理工作落后的企业都努力提高管理水平，向先进的企业看齐，这是没有理由做不到的。在这方面，各工业部门以及党和工会的领导机关的责任就是要用切实有效的办法来推广先进的经验，有力地督促落后单位去学习；就是要使得落后的单位感到有一种压力，非前进不可。如果落后单位仍然可以心安理得，我行我素，那就是一种不正常的现象。反之，落后者感到不安，感到如果不急起直追，就有被淘汰的危险，这才正是在我们的社会制度下的正常的现象。
    为了彻底改变那种好的不奖励、坏的不批评的保守主义作风，所有工业部门都必须对所属企业进行认真的督促和检查。对于在技术改革、生产管理、操作等方面确实是先进的单位和个人，都应当给予适当的奖励，对于一些长期保守落后的单位和个人应当给予必要的批评，而对于坚持落后、造成重大损失的领导者，就应当给以一定的处分。在一个工业系统内发现先进的单位，应当马上进行检查总结，推行这个先进单位的经验，派先进者到落后的单位去传授，或是落后的单位派人到先进单位去学习，并限期学好。各个工业部门应当立即认真总结出本部门行之有效的先进经验，并且作出规划，分别情况，派人下去帮助，限所属企业在一定期限内学好；应当广泛地开展同产业的厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛，把群众性的竞赛作为鼓励先进、消除落后的重要方法。在这些工作中，党和工会组织必须动员群众同各工业部门和企业行政方面协同一致地去作，充分地发扬职工群众的社会主义积极性。各地报纸也应该加强这方面的宣传和批判。我们只有抛弃那种懒洋洋的保守作风，而实行果敢的社会主义的作风，才能把事情办得快、办得好。
    消除落后，使落后赶上先进水平，这不是一时一地的事。在社会生活发展中总是经常存在着先进的事物和落后的事物的。社会主义社会发展的规律就是在先进和落后的斗争中不断地用先进来带动落后，落后的不断地赶上先进。今天这样高的标准是先进，明天要更高的标准才是先进。我们的社会生产力就是这样地一天天向前发展，我们的社会生活就是这样地一天天向前进步。因此不断地推广先进经验，不断地用先进的水平来要求落后者紧紧追上去，这是符合于社会主义社会发展规律的领导方法。只有这样的领导才不是脱离群众的领导，而是同群众密切结合、能鼓舞群众前进的领导。我们现在是在为加速我国的社会主义建设事业而努力，我们一定要学会这种领导方法。
