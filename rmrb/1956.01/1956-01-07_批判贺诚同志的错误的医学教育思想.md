　　Criticizing Comrade He Cheng's Erroneous Ideas on Medical Education
　　Gong Naiquan
    In order to maintain and improve the people's health and ensure the victorious advance of the motherland's construction, the Party and the government have given great importance and care to the people's health work. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, all health undertakings have developed unprecedentedly and achieved many successes. However, due to the reactionary government's indifference to the people's lives and health in the past, health work and medical education in old China were very backward, and medical personnel were extremely lacking. We still face many difficulties in health construction. One of the biggest difficulties in the current health construction is the lack of technical strength. Therefore, in accordance with the Party's guidelines for health work, it should be a major task of the national health leading organs to fully utilize the strength of existing Chinese and Western medical personnel, run medical education well, especially higher medical education, and strengthen medical scientific research to meet the needs of socialist construction.
    The senior medical personnel cultivated by our higher medical education should be politically loyal to the motherland and the socialist cause, wholeheartedly serve the people, possess systematic and comprehensive basic medical theoretical knowledge in their profession, master the professional knowledge and skills of various basic medical specialties, and begin to conduct more in-depth research on a certain medical specialty. Only senior medical personnel with these conditions can independently and creatively use systematic medical knowledge to solve various practical medical and health problems.
    However, Comrade He Cheng has a completely different view on the task of higher medical education in our country. He proposed the so-called "specialty focus system" in higher medical education. Under the banner of advocating so-called "specialist doctors," he advocated that senior medical personnel in our country only need to possess some fragmented medical knowledge and scattered medical skills directly related to a certain individual medical specialty. In the name of opposing "all-round" "general practitioners," he opposed conducting systematic and comprehensive basic medical theoretical education and education in professional knowledge and skills related to various basic medical specialties in higher medical colleges. In order to implement his "specialty focus system" education system, he proposed a set of methods. He said: "Our method is: First, implement a specialty education system that combines teaching, learning, and application, determining the curriculum by ensuring that basic courses serve clinical courses, and clinical courses serve actual needs. Second, implement a practical teaching method that combines listening, watching, and doing." According to his explanation, the latter is the "image teaching method." He believes that the "specialty focus system" and the "image teaching method" are the "best methods" for medical education in China today. He said, "Only by implementing the latter—specialty-focused education—can our medical education meet the needs and get on the right track," and "to train a large number of people's health workers who can solve problems, we all believe that the specialty focus system and the image teaching method are currently the best methods." Comrade He Cheng is very certain about the effect of the "specialty focus system." As early as 1948, when he summarized the experience of the China Medical University in implementing the "specialty focus system," he made the following conclusion: "The specialty education plan has played a revolutionary role in our medical education." Because Comrade He Cheng has such understanding and advocacy of the "specialty focus system," and has vigorously promoted this system in many higher medical colleges, it has caused extreme confusion in some medical colleges in the past few years, the quality of education cannot be improved, and graduates have felt great difficulties in their work, bringing undue losses to higher medical education in our country.
    From the perspective of medical science and medical education principles, the "specialty focus system" is fundamentally wrong. The direct object of a doctor's service is a person, and he must treat diseases from the perspective of treating the patient. The human body is a complex system composed of many parts, and these parts are closely related to form a unified whole. The central nervous system regulates all life activities of the body. Diseases are not just isolated changes in a certain organ or a certain group of cells; they are related to the entire body. Therefore, medical education must cultivate young doctors to have a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the human body so as to carry out prevention and treatment work from the concept that the human body is a unified whole. However, the "specialty focus system" is contrary to this principle, advocating "organized, planned, and purposeful specialization from the moment of enrollment." It makes students specialize in one subject from the very beginning according to the local division of diseases. This is to establish the medical education system on the basis of dissecting the human body into several parts and treating diseases as isolated phenomena. The medical knowledge students get with this kind of education method is extremely unsystematic and narrow. It instills wrong, one-sided, and localized medical viewpoints into students. Does this trained doctor, who lacks systematic basic medical theory and cannot thoroughly understand a branch of specialized knowledge, mean that this is the "right track" of higher medical education?
    From the perspective of the teaching plan and curriculum arrangement of the "specialty focus system," the "specialty focus system" also violates the principles of medical science. The teaching plan of the "specialty focus system" rigidly divides the various medical courses into "major subjects" and "minor subjects," and the minor subjects are further divided into "basic minor subjects" and "related minor subjects." Major basic medical subjects like physiology, pathology, and bacteriology are all included in the so-called "basic minor subjects," requiring these theoretical medical courses to "serve" clinical courses. It even regards these subjects as "just common sense in medicine." This teaching plan, which despises theory, fully demonstrates the bourgeois pragmatist viewpoint of cutting off the historical development of medical science and the interrelationships between various departments of medical science. The development of modern medicine is inseparable from the achievements of physiology, pathology, bacteriology, and other natural sciences. A young doctor cannot master diagnostic and treatment methods or be a good doctor if he is not fully prepared with this theoretical knowledge. In the past, when Comrade He Cheng was in charge of the Northeast Health Department, he formulated a "specialty education plan." When the "Northeast Medicine" magazine published this plan, it published an editorial saying that it "is a new plan for developing scientific medicine formulated according to objective needs and the level of world scientific medicine" and "can cultivate doctors and experts who can solve problems." The time stipulated in this plan for cultivating surgical specialists is that the total time for each medical course is 1,408 hours. Among them, surgery accounts for 666 hours, and anatomy accounts for 444 hours. However, the most important theoretical courses that serve as the foundation of modern medical science, such as physiology, only account for 44 hours, and bacteriology and pathology each account for 40 hours. This plan fully exposes how the "specialty focus system" neglects theory and the systematic nature of science.
    Although Comrade He Cheng has vigorously advocated and promoted the specialization of medical education, we can see from his reports and articles that he has not yet fully understood the concept of specialization in the development of modern medicine. On the one hand, he said: "Specialization is the product of scientific development. The higher the scientific development, the more precise the division of subjects." On the other hand, he said: "I think that the lower the level of education, the more specialization is needed. If all-round knowledge cannot be mastered, it is necessary to specialize. This is very clear. Since the level of education is low, one should not do too much, but only specialize in one subject." Obviously, he regards the specialization of medicine as the localization of knowledge and opposes systematic knowledge to specialization, which is extremely incorrect. With the progress of medical science and the invention and improvement of various treatment and diagnostic methods, clinical medicine has gradually been divided into several specialties. Not only are there internal medicine and surgery, but they are also divided into more detailed departments, such as neurology, cardiology, gastroenterology, etc. branching out from internal medicine. From surgery, not only obstetrics, gynecology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology have branched out, but also neurosurgery, thoracic surgery, orthopedic surgery, etc. The advantage of this division is that doctors can concentrate their energy more and conduct more in-depth research on a certain system, making diagnosis and treatment more accurate. However, doctors in any department should have a theoretical medical foundation and clinical knowledge of internal and surgery so that they can analyze the condition and determine the treatment based on the integrity of the human body and the unity of the human body and the external environment. If one only has narrow specialized knowledge and treats diseases from a local point of view, not only will it be a case of treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, but also because one cannot thoroughly understand and correctly interpret the changes in the disease, it will inevitably lead to serious errors in diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the specialized education of clinical medicine can only cultivate excellent specialist doctors on the basis of broad theoretical medical knowledge and sufficient clinical experience in internal and surgery.
    Pavlov once compared doctors to engineers of the human body. He said, "If the doctor is, in fact, especially in thought, the engineer of the human body, then any new achievement in physiology will sooner or later increase the doctor's ability to control his extremely complex machine and increase his ability to protect and repair this machine." He also said: "The last step for an engineer to study any machine is to install the disassembled and disordered machine as a test. Physiologists must also do this. Only those who can restore the disturbed life process to normal can say: I have studied life." That is to say, doctors must understand the structure and function of the human body, this particularly complex machine. The "specialty focus system" of medical education wants to train doctors into people who only have knowledge of repairing parts, completely distorting the meaning of medical education.
    Comrade He Cheng opposes the so-called "specialist doctors" and "general practitioners," which is completely wrong. First of all, one must have general medical knowledge, that is, have systematic and comprehensive basic medical theoretical knowledge and professional knowledge and skills of various basic medical specialties, and then one can further delve into a certain medical specialty on this basis. Without general basic medical theoretical knowledge and professional knowledge and skills in various subjects, it is not only impossible to conduct in-depth research in any specialty, but also impossible to independently undertake medical and health tasks in general. From the current need to vigorously develop medical and health undertakings and widely establish grassroots health organizations, the first requirement is also for higher medical colleges to train a large number of senior medical personnel who have basic medical theoretical knowledge and professional knowledge and skills in various subjects and can independently undertake general medical and health tasks.
    It must be pointed out that Comrade He Cheng has repeatedly said that the "specialty focus system" was proposed based on the experience of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in training cadres during the revolutionary war, which is not in line with the facts. During the past revolutionary wars, the People's Liberation Army did use short-term training methods in various regions to train a large number of primary and intermediate-level health personnel to meet the urgent needs of health work in the troops and liberated areas. However, the training principle at that time was to first teach basic medical theory and technical knowledge; after graduation, students were assigned to take on grassroots work such as health workers or medical assistants so that they could continue to learn and gradually improve in practice; after a certain period of work, they were trained again using methods such as further studies or apprenticeship, and then assigned to work equivalent to doctors, such as making diagnoses, prescriptions, and performing simple surgeries. This training method was a temporary measure taken under the circumstances of frequent battles, difficult technical conditions, lack of manpower and material resources, and urgent need for cadres. It is not the best method that should be adopted under all conditions, let alone the regular method for training senior medical personnel after the nationwide liberation. It has nothing in common with the "specialty focus system" that Comrade He Cheng said should be "applied in different times and spaces."
    As for the so-called "image teaching method" supported by Comrade He Cheng, it is entirely a set of teaching methods formulated to implement the "specialty focus system." The "image teaching method" advocates "image textbooks" with "many pictures and few words, clear at a glance," opposes textbooks, and advocates the complete use of "image textbooks" of human bodies and real objects, "replacing chalk with equipment and instruments, and flesh with blackboards," "eliminating the base classroom of dogmatism," thus developing the pragmatist viewpoint of the "specialty focus system" that neglects theory to an extremely serious degree.
    The greatest harm of the subjective idealist pragmatist educational thought of the "specialty focus system" and the "image teaching method" to the broad masses of health cadres, medical personnel, and students of higher medical colleges is the non-holistic medical viewpoint and extremely careless medical style it spreads. Although it is impossible for young people to learn comprehensive specialized knowledge under this erroneous education system, they stubbornly say that their method can make it possible to "learn something that used to take half a year or a year in just a few hours, or even tens of minutes now," "so that every student can obtain excellent, accurate, and skilled specialized techniques," and "specialize in one subject and be proficient in one subject." The medical personnel trained in this way cannot completely independently undertake medical tasks. If they completely independently undertake medical tasks, it is inevitable that errors will occur in diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, because the "image teaching method" supported by Comrade He Cheng treats patients with an extremely unserious attitude, regards patients as "image textbooks," and advocates "taking skill training as the main learning method," Comrade He Cheng even said that "or taking an individual as a model to talk about what muscles, blood vessels, and nerves are there, these are all image textbooks." All of this will make medical personnel, especially young doctors, take a careless attitude towards patients, leading to errors in diagnosis and treatment. If Comrade He Cheng's set of medical ideas is allowed to develop arbitrarily, the seriousness of the consequences is unimaginable.
    In order to meet the needs of the construction of the people's health cause, it is very necessary to reform the old medical education. But this must be carried out in strict accordance with the Party's policies. After liberation, the Party has given many important instructions on the guidelines for higher education, including higher medical education. The Party instructed that the reform of the old higher education institutions must be carried out step by step and cautiously. The resolution of the First National Higher Education Conference also clearly pointed out: "It is necessary to prevent the narrow pragmatist or empiricist tendency of neglecting theoretical study." The training of specialized talents further pointed out: "Appropriate specialization should be implemented on the basis of systematic theoretical knowledge" in order to strive for sound and solid specialization on the basis of all-round development. Comrade He Cheng neither studies nor implements these guidelines and policies, but stubbornly adheres to his own views and insists on his own way, trying every means to promote his "specialty focus system."
    The errors that Comrade He Cheng committed in medical education, like the errors he committed on the issue of traditional Chinese medicine and other policy issues related to health work, are because he usually regards himself as a meritorious official and technical cadre, is proud and complacent, is divorced from politics and the masses, does not respect the leadership of the Party, and believes that the Party does not understand technology and therefore cannot lead health work.
    I fully agree with the speech made by Comrade Lin Feng, Director of the Second Office of the State Council, at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress: "Numerous facts prove that any revolutionary work cannot move forward without Marxism-Leninism and the leadership of the Party. Any idea that the Party cannot lead cultural and educational work is extremely wrong and must be corrected." This passage of Comrade Lin Feng's speech has great educational significance for each of our health cadres and medical personnel. We should examine ourselves well according to the spirit of this passage. We must remember the lessons of Comrade He Cheng's mistakes, be vigilant, and always prevent the erosion of bourgeois ideology on us, strengthen political training, strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, and serve the people's health cause sincerely and conscientiously.

　　批判贺诚同志的错误的医学教育思想
    宫乃泉
    为了维护和提高人民的健康水平，保证祖国建设事业的胜利前进，党和政府对人民保健工作给予极大的重视和关怀。中华人民共和国成立以来，各项卫生事业都有了空前的发展，获得了许多成就。但由于过去反动政府对人民的生命和健康漠不关心，旧中国的卫生工作和医学教育十分落后，医务人员非常缺乏，我们在卫生事业建设中的困难还是很多的。当前卫生事业建设的最大困难之一是技术力量的不足。所以，遵照党对卫生工作的方针，充分发挥现有中西医药人员的力量，办好医学教育，首先是高等医学教育，加强医学科学的研究工作，以适应社会主义建设事业的需要，应当是国家卫生领导机关的重大任务。
    我国的高等医学教育培养出来的高级医务人员，应当在政治上忠于祖国、忠于社会主义事业，全心全意为人民服务，在业务上具备系统而全面的基础医学理论知识，掌握各个基本医学专科的专业知识和技术，并且开始对某一个医学专科进行较为深入的钻研。只有具备这样的条件的高级医务人员，才能独立地、创造性地运用系统的医学知识解决各种实际的医疗保健问题。
    但是，贺诚同志对于我国高等医学教育的任务却有一套完全不同的看法。他提出了所谓高等医学教育中的“专科重点制”，在提倡所谓“专科医生”的名义下，主张我国的高级医务人员只需要具备若干直接关联某一个别医学专科的割裂了的医学知识和零星的医疗技术，并且在反对“一揽子”的“一般医生”的名义下，反对在高等医学院校进行系统而全面的基础医学理论的教育和有关各个基本医学专科的专业知识和技术的教育。为了贯彻执行他的“专科重点制”的教育制度，他提出了一套办法。他说：“我们的办法就是：第一，实行教、学、用合一的专科教育制度，确定了基础课服从临床课，临床课服从现实需要，来决定课程的。第二，实行听、看、做合一的实际教学方法。”据他解释，后者就是“形象教学法”。他认为“专科重点制”和“形象教学法”是中国当前医学教育的“最好的办法”，他说“惟有实行后者——专科重点教育——才能使我们的医学教育符合需要，走入正轨”，“训练大批能解决问题的人民卫生工作者，我们全体认为专科重点制和形象教学法是目前最好的办法”。贺诚同志对“专科重点制”的效果是非常肯定的。早在1948年他在总结中国医科大学实施“专科重点制”的经验的时候就作过如下的结论：“专科教育计划在我们医学教育上，它是起了革命的作用。”由于贺诚同志对“专科重点制”有这样的认识和主张，并且曾经把这种制度在许多高等医学院校中大力推行，致使过去几年来一部分医学院校极度混乱，教育质量不能提高，毕业学生在工作上感到很大困难，给我国高等医学教育带来了不应有的损失。
    从医学科学和医学教育的原则来看，“专科重点制”是根本错误的。医生服务的直接对象是人，他必须在医治病人的观点上来医治疾病。人体是由许多部分组成的复杂的系统，这许多部分互相密切联系成为一个统一的整体。中枢神经系统调节机体的一切生活活动。疾病并不只是某一器官或者某一群细胞的孤立的变化，它是和整个机体有关系的。所以医学教育必须培养青年医生对人的身体有全面和系统的了解，以便从人身是一个统一的整体的观念来进行预防和治疗工作。然而“专科重点制”正和这个原则相反，主张“有组织的、有计划的、有目的的从一入学就专”。使学生从一开始就按疾病的局部划分来专学一门，这是把医学教育制度建立在将人体割裂成若干部分、将疾病当作孤立的现象的基础上。用这种教育方法使学生得到的是极不系统和狭隘的医学知识，是把错误的片面性和局部性的医学观点灌输给学生。这样训练出来的医生既缺乏系统的基本医学理论，又不能彻底搞通一个分科的专门知识，难道说这是高等医学教育的“正轨”吗？
    从“专科重点制”的教学计划和课程安排来看，“专科重点制”也是违反医学科学原则的。“专科重点制”的教学计划生硬地把医学的各科课程分为“主科”和“辅科”，辅科又分为“基础辅科”和“关联辅科”。把主要的基础医学像生理学、病理学、细菌学等都列入了所谓“基础辅科”，要这些理论医学课“服从”临床课。甚至把这些学科看作“只是医学中的常识”。这种轻视理论的教学计划，十足地表现了割断医学科学的历史发展和医学科学各部门间的互相联系的资产阶级实用主义观点。现代医学的发展跟生理学、病理学、细菌学和其他自然科学的成就是分不开的。一个青年医生，如果对这些理论知识没有充分准备，就不可能掌握诊断和治疗方法，也不可能做一个好的医生。过去贺诚同志在领导东北卫生部的时候，曾经制定了一个“专科教育计划”。“东北医学”杂志公布这个计划的时候，曾经发表社论，说它“是根据客观需要与世界科学医学水平而制定的新的发展科学医学的新计划”，“能培养出解决问题的医生和专家”。这个计划中的培养外科专科医生的时间规定是各医学课程总时数为1，408小时。其中外科学占666小时，解剖学占444小时。而作为现代医学科学基础的最主要的理论课像生理学只占44小时，细菌学和病理学各占40小时。这个计划完全暴露了“专科重点制”是如何地忽视理论和科学的系统性。
    贺诚同志虽然极力提倡和推行医学教育的专科化，但从他的报告和文章中，我们可以看出他对现代医学发展中专科化的概念，还根本没搞清楚。他一面说：“专科化是科学发达的产物，科学发达愈高，分科就得愈精。”一面又说：“我认为文化程度低，更需要专门化。一揽子搞不通，更得专门化，这个道理很明白，既然文化程度低，就不应多搞，只有专一门。”显然他把医学的专科化当成知识的局限化，把系统的知识同专门化对立起来，这是极不正确的。随着医学科学的进展，各种治疗诊断方法的发明和改进，临床医学逐渐分成若干专科，不仅有内科和外科，而且又分成更细的科，像从内科分化出精神病、心脏、消化系等科。从外科不仅分化出产科、妇科、眼科、耳鼻喉科，更分化出脑神经外科、胸部外科、矫形外科等。这样分科的好处是使医生更能集中精力，对某一系统作更深入的研究，使诊断和治疗更能准确。但无论哪科的医生，都应当具有理论医学基础和内外科的临床知识，以便能根据人体的完整性和人体和外界环境的统一性的原则，分析病情，确定治疗。如果只有狭隘的专科知识，以局部观点来处理疾病，不但是头疼医头，脚疼医脚，而且因为不能透彻了解和正确解释疾病变化，必然会造成诊断和治疗的严重错误。所以临床医学的分科教育只有建立在广泛的理论医学知识和充分的内外科临床经验的基础上，才能培养出优良的专科医生。
    巴甫洛夫曾经把医生比作人体的机师，他说：“如果说，医生在事实上，尤其是在思想上，是人体的机师，那么，生理学的任何新的成就，或早或迟必然会增加医生对他的异常复杂的机械的控制能力，增加他保护与修理这个机械的能力。”又说：“一个机师研究任何一部机器的最后一个步骤，是将拆开并紊乱了的机器安装起来，以此作为一个测验。生理学者也必须这样。只有能够使被破坏了的生命过程恢复正常的人，才能够说：我已经研究了生命。”这就是说，医生必须通晓人体这个特别复杂的机体的构造和功能。而“专科重点制”的医学教育却要把医生培养成只有修理零件知识的人，完全歪曲了医学教育的意义。
    贺诚同志把所谓“专科医生”和“一般医生”对立起来，这是完全错误的。首先必须具备一般的医学知识，即具备系统而全面的基础医学理论知识和各个基本医学专科的专业知识和技术，然后才能在这个基础上进一步深入钻研某一个医学专科。没有一般的基础医学理论知识和各科专业知识和技术，不仅不可能在任何专科深入钻研，而且一般的都不可能独立担负起医疗保健任务。从目前大力发展医疗卫生事业，广泛建立基层卫生组织的需要来看，首先也是要求高等医学院校培养大量具备基础医学理论知识和各科专业知识和技术、能独立担负起一般的医疗保健任务的高级医务人员。
    必须指出，贺诚同志曾一再说“专科重点制”是根据中国人民解放军在革命战争时期培养干部的经验而提出的，这是不符合事实的。在历次革命战争时期，人民解放军在各地区确实用过短期训练的方法，培养了大批的初、中级卫生人员，以适应部队和解放区群众的卫生工作的迫切需要。但当时的训练原则，是先教以基本的医学理论和技术知识；在学生结业后分配去担任基层工作如卫生员或医助，以便在实际当中继续学习，逐步提高；经过一定时期的工作，再用进修或带徒弟等方法加以训练，然后分配担任相当于医生的工作，像作诊断、处方、施行简单手术等。这种训练方法是在战斗频繁、技术条件困难、人力和物力缺乏、需要干部迫切的情况下所采取的一种临时性的办法。它并不是在一切条件下都应当采取的最好的办法，更不是在全国解放后培养高级医务人员的正规办法。它跟贺诚同志所说的要“在不同的时间和空间去应用”的“专科重点制”毫无共同之处。
    至于贺诚同志所支持的所谓“形象教学法”，则完全是为了贯彻施行“专科重点制”而制定的一套教学方法。“形象教学法”主张“图多字少、一目了然”的“形象教材”，反对教科书，主张完全采用人体和实物的“形象教材”，“以器材仪器代替粉笔，肉体代替黑板”，“消灭教条主义的根据地课堂”，这样，就把“专科重点制”的忽视理论的实用主义观点发展到了极端严重的地步。
    “专科重点制”和“形象教学法”的主观唯心的实用主义教育思想，给广大卫生干部、医务人员以及高等医学院校的学生的最大危害是它散布的非整体的医学观点和极端轻率的医疗作风。虽然在这种错误的教育制度下不可能使青年学到全面的专科知识，但他们却硬说用他们的办法可以把“过去要有半年一年才能学会的东西，现在只需数小时，甚至数十分钟即可学会”，“使每个同学都能获得优良准确熟练的专科技术”，“专学一科精通一科”。这样训练出来的医务人员，是不能完全独立担负医疗任务的，如果完全独立担负医疗任务，是难免要发生诊断和治疗的错误的。更由于贺诚同志所支持的“形象教学法”是以极不严肃的态度对待病人，把病人看成是“形象教材”，并且提倡“以练技术为主要的学习方法”，贺诚同志甚至说“或拿个人来作模特儿讲什么肌肉血管神经在那儿，这都是形象教材”，这一切都会使医务人员特别是青年医生对病人采取轻率的态度，以致造成诊断和治疗上的错误。如果让贺诚同志的一套医学思想任意发展下去，其结果之严重，是难以想像的。
    为了适应人民卫生事业建设的需要，对旧医学教育进行改革是十分必要的。但这必须严格地遵照党的政策进行。解放后，党对高等教育的方针，包括高等医学教育在内，曾作过许多的重要指示。党指示对旧的高等学校的改革必须有步骤地谨慎地进行。第一届全国高等教育会议的决议中也曾明确指出：“要防止轻视理论学习的狭隘实用主义或经验主义的偏向”，对专门人材的训练更指出“要在系统的理论知识的基础上，实行适当的专门化”，以便在全面发展的基础上争取健全的和结实的专门化。而贺诚同志对待这些方针政策，既不研究也不贯彻执行，仍然固执己见，一意孤行，想尽各种办法，推行他的“专科重点制”。
    贺诚同志在医学教育中所犯的错误，跟他在中医问题和其他关于卫生工作的政策问题上所犯的错误一样，是由于他平时以功臣和技术干部自居，骄傲自满，脱离政治，脱离群众，不尊重党的领导，认为党不懂技术，因而不能领导卫生工作。
    我完全同意国务院第二办公室主任林枫同志在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言中所指出的：“无数事实证明，任何革命工作离开了马克思列宁主义和党的领导，就无法前进。任何认为党不能领导文教工作的想法，都是极端错误的，必须加以纠正。”林枫同志的这一段话对我们每个卫生干部和医务人员，都有极大的教育意义。我们应当根据这一段话的精神，很好地检查自己。我们必须记取贺诚同志所犯错误的教训，提高警惕，时刻防止资产阶级思想对我们的侵蚀，加强政治锻炼，加强马克思列宁主义理论的学习，诚诚恳恳、兢兢业业地为人民的保健事业服务。
