Our Country's First Gear Shaving Machine Successfully Trial-Produced

    The Chongqing Machine Tool Factory successfully trial-produced our country's first 571Б gear shaving machine in mid-December. The 571Б gear shaving machine is a Soviet-style semi-automatic gear cutting machine tool that can finish a first-class precision gear in less than 40 seconds. This machine tool is an indispensable piece of equipment for modern machine manufacturing factories that produce airplanes, automobiles, machine tools, tractors, and the like. Although the precision requirements for the various parts of this machine tool are very high, and the factory's machine equipment is insufficient, many difficulties were encountered during the trial production process. However, thanks to the efforts of the workers and under the guidance of Soviet experts Demitov and Yaroshenko, they were all overcome. (Our correspondent in Chongqing)

    我国第一台剃齿机试制成功
    重庆机床厂于12月中旬试制成功我国第一台571Б型剃齿机。571Б型剃齿机是苏联式半自动化的一种齿轮切削工作母机，在40秒钟以内就能精加工好一个一级精度的齿轮。这种机床是制造飞机、汽车、机床、拖拉机等现代化机器制造工厂所不可缺少的设备。虽然这种机床的各种零件的精密度要求很高，厂里机器设备又不足，在试制过程中遇到许多困难，但是由于职工们的努力，在苏联专家杰米托夫和亚罗申科的指导下，都得到克服。　（本报驻重庆记者）
