    "U.S. Aid" is Undermining the Thai Economy
    Feng Zhidan
    Thailand has long been under the oppression of colonialism, which has caused its economic backwardness. The Thai economy is mainly agricultural. During World War I, Thailand's national industry had a little development, but after the war, it suffered a fatal blow from colonialism and could not recover. Therefore, this originally extremely rich country has not been able to develop independently in economic terms.
    Rice, rubber, tin, and timber are the major products of Thailand, accounting for about 80% of its total exports. However, in recent years, the output and export volume of these agricultural products have shown a downward trend. According to statistics from the Thai Ministry of Agriculture, Thailand's rice production in 1954 was 5.8 million tons, a decrease of 32.56% compared to 1953. The rice paddy planting area and yield per unit area are both declining. According to the British magazine "The Economist," Thailand's rice exports in 1954 decreased by 350,000 tons compared to 1953, making the total export volume less than one million tons, the lowest figure since the war. Rubber production reached a historical high in 1951, but it began to decline after 1952. In 1953, the total value of Thailand's rubber exports decreased by more than half compared to 1951. The tin production situation deteriorated even more significantly. Tin production reached more than 15,000 metric tons before the war, but in 1952 it was only more than 9,600 tons.
    Thailand mainly relies on exporting goods to earn foreign exchange. In recent years, due to shrinking exports and surging imports, the balance of payments has turned from a surplus to a deficit. According to the latest issue of the Thai bi-monthly "Economic," from January to September 1955, Thailand's foreign trade deficit reached 1,266 million baht, an increase of about 70% compared to the total deficit for the entire year of 1954. With the continuous increase in foreign trade deficits, Thailand's foreign exchange reserves are becoming increasingly depleted. The imbalance in national revenue and expenditure is also becoming more serious. In 1949, Thailand's fiscal deficit was 500 million baht, and in 1954 it reached 1,480 million baht. In the five years from 1950 to 1954, Thailand's fiscal deficit totaled more than 3.5 billion baht. In the past three years, the Thai government has borrowed as much as 6 billion baht. The Thai government wants to use the method of devaluing the Thai currency to reverse the downward trend of shrinking foreign exchange and gold reserves. In March 1955, the official devaluation of the Thai currency was announced, and the exchange rate was changed from 12.5 baht per US dollar to 20 baht per US dollar. But by May 1955, the Thai currency in the free market had depreciated by another 12%.
    In this situation, prices in Thailand have risen alarmingly, people's purchasing power has decreased significantly, the market is showing a sluggish scene, and the number of shops losing money and closing down is increasing.
    The increasing deterioration of the Thai economy is the result of the United States forcing Thailand to implement policies that violate its national interests. In 1950, the United States successively signed "Economic and Technical Assistance" and "Military Assistance" agreements with Thailand. In 1954, Thailand also joined the notorious Southeast Asia Military Group. In this way, Thailand's domestic and foreign policies cannot but be affected by the United States. Thailand is forced to expand its military equipment endlessly, thus seriously damaging the already very fragile Thai economy. In 1953, Thailand's military expenditure was 1.965 billion baht, and in 1954 it increased to more than 2.5 billion baht, accounting for 60% of budget revenue. Thailand's military expenditure in 1955 has increased unabated.
    At the same time, American monopoly capital is intensifying its penetration into Thailand and wantonly carrying out imperialist plunder. The agreements that the United States forced Thailand to sign stipulate Thailand's obligation to transfer its national natural resources. The United States' monopoly of Thailand's raw materials and markets has greatly deepened Thailand's economic crisis. The United States also uses "embargo" and price suppression policies to plunder Thailand. According to estimates by some Thai members of parliament in 1953, rubber alone caused Thailand to lose nearly 2 billion baht in foreign exchange. Because the United States dumped its surplus rice in the Asian region, Thailand lost its foreign rice market. In particular, due to the constraints of the "embargo," Thailand cannot freely develop trade relations with other countries, which makes Thailand's foreign trade in a more disadvantageous position.
    Since the end of the war, American and Japanese goods have flooded the Thai market. According to statistics, American imports to Thailand in 1953 increased 20 times compared to before the war. The Thai bi-monthly "Economic" pointed out: "Currently, the goods flooding the Thai market are all from dollar zone countries." The dumping of American and Japanese goods is severely打击打击泰国微弱的民族工业及农业. Due to the competition from American goods, 75% of Thailand's textile factories have closed down. In 1955, the import of a large amount of surplus tobacco leaves from the United States aroused dissatisfaction among Thai members of parliament. Thai parliamentarian Nai Pi Long pointed out that Thailand's tobacco production has exceeded domestic needs, and not only is it unnecessary to import tobacco from abroad, but it is also necessary to find export markets for the surplus tobacco.
    The so-called "U.S. Aid" has not brought any benefits to Thailand, but has only deepened its economic crisis. Recently, the Indian weekly "Delhi Times" reported that since Thailand accepted "aid" from the United States, Thailand's rice exports have decreased by 25%, timber exports have decreased by 30%, and tobacco exports have decreased by 50%. From October 1950 to the end of 1953, the United States approved a total of more than 23 million US dollars in economic "aid" to Thailand, but only about 15 million US dollars was actually paid; however, according to the recent Thai bi-monthly "Economic," Thailand spends no less than 500 million baht, or about 25 million US dollars, each year to support American soldiers and experts. It is clear that "U.S. Aid," as a pioneer for American monopoly capital groups to carry out colonial expansion, is very clear in Thailand.
    In the face of increasingly deteriorating economic conditions, domestic calls in Thailand for breaking free from the shackles of foreign forces and implementing an independent and autonomous foreign policy are growing louder. The "Delhi Times" weekly reporter in Bangkok pointed out: "The vast majority of Thai residents do not approve of the policy of letting the United States command Thailand." The "Siam Masses" also believes that Thailand's following the U.S. "embargo" policy is a "self-inflicted hardship." Recently, some political and business figures in Thailand have advocated changing Thailand's foreign policy and establishing friendly and direct trade relations with China. Thai parliamentarian Nai Pengtai Chu De Nuchi believes that the Thai authorities' one-sided foreign policy of contact with the United States is "an inappropriate policy." He said that pursuing a policy of peaceful coexistence will definitely benefit Thailand. (Attached picture)

    “美援”正在破坏泰国经济
    冯之丹
    泰国长期处在殖民主义的压迫下，造成了它的经济的落后状态。泰国经济主要是农业经济。在第一次世界大战期间，泰国的民族工业曾有过一点发展，但是战争结束以后，又遭到了殖民主义的致命打击而抬不起头来。因此，这个本来极其丰饶的国家，在经济上一直不能独立发展。
    大米、橡胶、锡和木材是泰国出产的大宗的产品，约占它出口货物总额的80％。但是近几年来，这些农产品的产量及输出量都有下降的趋势。根据泰国农业部的统计材料，1954年泰国稻谷产量为580万吨，比1953年减少了32.56％。稻田播种面积及单位面积产量都在下降。据英国“经济学家”杂志报道，1954年泰国大米输出较1953年降低了35万吨，使总输出量不足一百万吨，为战后的最低数字。橡胶产量在1951年曾经达到历史上最高的数字，但是在1952年以后即开始走向下坡。1953年，泰国橡胶输出总值较1951年减少了一半以上。锡的生产情况恶化得更加显著。锡产量战前曾达到15，000多公吨，而在1952年只有9，600余吨。
    泰国主要是依靠出口货物来换取外汇的。近年来由于出口萎缩，进口激增，因而使得国际收支由顺差转为逆差。据最近一期泰国“经济”半月刊报道，1955年1月至9月，泰国对外贸易逆差已达到126，600万铢，较1954年全年的入超还增加了70％左右。随着对外贸易入超的不断增加，泰国的外汇储备越来越枯竭了。国家收支不平衡的现象也日趋严重。1949年泰国财政赤字为五亿铢，1954年达到148，000万铢。1950年到1954年的五年中，泰国财政赤字共达35亿多铢。在过去三年中，泰国政府所借贷的款项已达60亿铢。泰国政府想用宣布泰币贬值的办法来挽回外汇和黄金准备金缩减的颓势。1955年3月，官方正式宣布泰币贬值，汇兑率由每美元——12.5铢改为每美元——20铢。但到1955年5月间，自由市场的泰币又贬值12％。
    在这种情况下，泰国物价惊人地上升，人民购买力显著下降，市场呈现萧条景象，商店亏本和倒闭者日益增多。
    泰国经济的日益恶化，是美国强使泰国执行违背它的民族利益的政策的结果。1950年，美国先后和泰国签订了“经济技术援助”、“军事援助”等协定，1954年泰国又参加了臭名昭著的东南亚军事集团。这样，泰国的对内对外政策就不能不受到美国的影响。泰国被迫着无止境地扩张军备，因而严重地损害了本来已经十分脆弱的泰国经济。1953年，泰国军费支出为19.65亿铢，1954年又增加到25亿铢以上，占到预算收入的60％。1955年度泰国的军费支出有增无已。
    同时，美国垄断资本加紧渗入泰国，并肆意地对它进行帝国主义的掠夺。美国强制泰国签订的协定，都规定了泰国出让本国自然富源的义务。美国对泰国原料与市场的垄断，大大加深了泰国的经济危机。美国又利用“禁运”和压价政策对泰国进行掠夺，据一些泰国议员在1953年估计，仅橡胶一项就使泰国损失了近20亿铢的外汇。由于美国把它的剩余大米向亚洲地区倾销，使得泰国丧失了它的国外大米市场。特别是由于“禁运”的束缚，泰国不能自由地同其它国家发展贸易联系，这就使得泰国的对外贸易处于更加不利的地位。
    战后以来，美国货及日本货充斥了泰国的市场。据统计，1953年美国输入泰国的货物较战前增加了20倍。泰国“经济”半月刊曾指出：“目前泛滥于泰国市场的，都是美元区国家的货物。”美货及日货的倾销严重地打击着泰国微弱的民族工业及农业。由于美国货的竞争，泰国75％的纺织厂已经倒闭。1955年美国大量剩余烟叶的输入，引起了泰国议员的不满。泰议员乃皮隆指出，泰国的烟草生产已经超过了国内的需要，不但没有必要从国外输入烟草，而且还要为剩余的烟草寻找出口市场。
    所谓“美援”并没有给泰国带来什么好处，只加深了它的经济危机。最近印度“德里时代”周刊报道，自从泰国接受美国“援助”以后，泰国的大米出口已经减少了25％，木材出口减少了30％，烟草出口减少了50％。自1950年10月至1953年底，美国批准给泰国的经济“援助”共计2，300多万美元，实际支付只有约1，500万美元左右；但是，据最近泰国“经济”半月刊透露，泰国每年用于供养美国军人和专家等的费用却不少于五亿铢，约合2，500万美元。由此可见，“美援”作为美国垄断资本集团进行殖民扩张的开路机，在泰国是表现得再清楚也没有了。
    在经济情况愈来愈恶化的情况下，泰国国内要求摆脱外国势力的束缚，执行独立自主的对外政策的呼声日益增高。“德里时代”周刊驻曼谷记者就指出：“泰国居民绝大多数不赞成听任美国指挥泰国的那种政策。”“暹罗群众报”也认为，泰国追随美国的“禁运”政策是一种“自甘承受困难苦楚的想法”。最近，泰国一些政界和商界人士纷纷主张改变泰国的对外政策，同中国建立友好和直接的贸易关系。泰议员乃彭泰·触的努七就认为，泰国当局片面同美国联系的对外政策是“一种不适宜的政策”，他说：奉行和平共处的政策将肯定地有利于泰国。（附图片）
