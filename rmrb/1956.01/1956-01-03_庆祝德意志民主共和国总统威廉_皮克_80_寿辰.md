　　Celebrating the 80th Birthday of Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic
　　Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany
　　January 3, 1956, marks the 80th anniversary of the life full of work and struggle of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic—the first truly democratic Germany—and member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. His development, activities, and struggles reflect the excellent traditions of the German working class.
　　Born into a working-class family, Wilhelm Pieck joined the socialist workers' movement at the age of 19. He was one of the thousands of class-conscious workers who, despite having to engage in arduous labor in capitalist enterprises, still used every spare moment to fight for the liberation of the working class. Based on his own experience, Wilhelm Pieck was familiar with the lives of ordinary people and the hard work of cadres in the workers' movement, and therefore he had the closest shared feelings with the working people.
　　In his 60 years of trade union and political activity, Wilhelm Pieck held many positions in the socialist workers' movement. He organized strikes and election rallies, and he served as an agitator, organizer, and propagandist. He dedicated his life to the struggle against German militarism and imperialist wars and for the liberation of the working class from the shackles of capitalist exploitation.
　　Wilhelm Pieck, in all his positions in the Party and mass organizations, always started from the understanding that only the proletariat is the consistently progressive and revolutionary class. In his political work, he never separated himself from the source of revolutionary power—the masses. Because of his uncompromising struggle for the cause of the working people—the cause of peace and socialism—he earned the respect and trust of the German and international proletariat.
　　Wilhelm Pieck developed from an ordinary party member into a leader of the struggle against German imperialism during a period of growing imperialist war danger. The struggle of German financial capital for colonies, the sharpening of German-British contradictions, and the Russo-Japanese War were serious signals of the intensification of imperialist contradictions. This was followed by the sharpening of the class struggle in Germany. The opportunists within the German Social Democratic Party at that time advocated the easing of class contradictions and the peaceful transition to socialism. Lenin had severely criticized this reformist idea at the beginning of the century because it made the working class tolerate capitalist enslavement and prevented them from rising up against the imperialists' attempts to wage war.
　　Even before the First World War, Wilhelm Pieck already belonged to the left wing of the German Social Democratic Party, led by Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, and Franz Mehring. Together with them, he fought against the growing bourgeois and imperialist influence within the German Social Democratic Party and strived to mobilize the entire party to fight against capitalist exploitation and oppression, against imperialism, and to persistently fight for the overthrow of capitalist class rule.
　　The struggle against German militarism and its war preparations was an important hallmark of the struggle of the left wing of the Social Democratic Party. They organized anti-militarist propaganda, supported the Stuttgart Resolution of the International Socialist Congress in 1907 and the Basel Resolution in 1912, which opposed the preparation of an imperialist world war and demanded that this war be transformed into a proletarian revolution.
　　With the outbreak of the First World War, when the opportunists joined the German imperialist camp and voted in favor of the war budget in the Reichstag on August 4, 1914, only the group united around Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, and Wilhelm Pieck saved the honor of the German workers' movement. They fought against the imperialist war, against the main enemy of their own country—the Konzerns and financial oligarchs.
　　During this difficult period, Wilhelm Pieck became one of the organizers of the "International" group and later the Spartacus League. Neither persecution nor imprisonment could make him give up the resolute struggle against the imperialist war and its instigators—the big capitalists and Junkers.
　　With the great turning point in world history—the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution—the German working class and the German people faced the decision: to immediately make peace with Soviet Russia or to continue the war, which would mean disaster for Germany. From the beginning, Wilhelm Pieck had a close and friendly feeling for the heroic Soviet people. He tirelessly explained to the workers and the masses of the people that the establishment of working-class rule in Russia also provided the German people with every possibility to advance peacefully, democratically, and socialistically in friendship with Soviet Russia.
　　The defeat of German imperialism in the First World War provided a good opportunity for the German working class to smash the power of German arms capital and the Junkers and their state apparatus. Due to the lack of a revolutionary party, the betrayal of the social and national interests of the people by the Social Democratic and trade union leaders, and the illusions of the majority of the working class in the bourgeois parliament, the vanguard of the working class suffered defeat in the November Revolution of 1918.
　　It was not until the establishment of the Communist Party of Germany at the end of 1918 that a cornerstone was laid for a mass Marxist-Leninist party. Wilhelm Pieck was one of the founders of the Communist Party of Germany and was elected to the Party's Central Committee. From that time on, he has always been a leading cadre of the Party. Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, and Leo Jogiches were murdered shortly after the Party was founded. In this way, the newly established Party lost its best and most famous leaders in a very difficult and complex situation.
　　The young Communist Party of Germany inherited the cause of its martyred comrades with heroism and fearlessness. It united the revolutionary forces under the pursuit and persecution of the White Guard baton. Wilhelm Pieck played a great role in the merger of the Communist Party of Germany and the left wing of the Independent Social Democratic Party—led by such an outstanding workers' leader as Ernst Thälmann—into a mass party. In his efforts to build and consolidate the Communist Party of Germany into a mass Marxist-Leninist party, Wilhelm Pieck always regarded the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as a great example; the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Lenin and Stalin, gave selfless assistance to the German workers' movement.
　　During the Weimar Republic period, as a member of the leadership of the Communist Party of Germany, Wilhelm Pieck played a leading role in mobilizing the masses against the gradual abolition of democracy and economic plunder of the working people, and against the resurgence of German imperialism and militarism. He enthusiastically strived for the establishment of unity of action among Social Democratic workers. Wilhelm Pieck was one of the most ardent advocates of establishing a great anti-fascist united front. His speeches during this period were fiery appeals, full of a high sense of responsibility for the working people who suffered infinite suffering due to the victory of fascism. Although they had exhausted all their strength, the ruling class, with the help of the Social Democratic and trade union leaders, paralyzed the majority of the working class, so the vanguard of the working class carried out the anti-fascist struggle in isolation.
　　The Communist Party of Germany, under the leadership of Ernst Thälmann, from the very beginning called the fascist rule a terrorist dictatorship of warmongering monopoly capital. This correct assessment of the Hitler regime was reflected in Thälmann's slogan "Hitler is war!" The Communist Party of Germany, in line with its great past of anti-imperialist struggle, continued the struggle against this war rule steadfastly and unswervingly under the most difficult conditions and with the greatest sacrifices. The leader of the German working class, Ernst Thälmann, was one of the earliest victims of fascist terror. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany entrusted Wilhelm Pieck with the task of inheriting his work. In the spirit of Thälmann, Wilhelm Pieck led the Party to fight persistently for the establishment of a united workers' front and to unite all those who opposed Hitler to form a great German People's Front.
　　The policy of the Party under the leadership of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Germany was aimed at overthrowing Hitler in order to defend peace. Wilhelm Pieck called on all peace-loving Germans to overthrow the warmonger Hitler for the benefit of the nation. When Hitler committed his greatest crime—attacking the Soviet Union—Wilhelm Pieck launched extensive anti-fascist propaganda. He actively participated in the work of the "National Committee for a Free Germany," which aimed to promote an early end to the war and the collapse of Hitler's rule.
　　After the Soviet army defeated Hitler's fascism, the major question facing the German people was: how to get rid of the material and spiritual chaos, and through what channels could a new, anti-fascist-democratic Germany be established. On June 11, 1945, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, headed by Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, put forward a clear program to the working class and all working people for saving the nation and rebuilding Germany. Its basic principle was the unified action of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party and the joint cooperation of all democratic forces. The primary task put forward in this appeal was: to eliminate the remnants of Hitler's rule and establish a democratic regime. Wilhelm Pieck's historical achievement lies in the fact that he and Otto Grotewohl together achieved the goal of establishing a unified workers' party, which the Communist Party under the leadership of Ernst Thälmann had been striving for for decades. Learning from the painful and bloody lessons of German history, overcoming the unfortunate division of the workers' movement for decades, and establishing a unified party to lead the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism—he played a greater role in this than anyone else. Marxism-Leninism has triumphed in the German workers' movement.
　　The united party of the working class has become a powerful driving force in uniting all democratic forces in the National Front of Democratic Germany. The National Front of Democratic Germany launched a struggle against the actions of US imperialism in colluding with West German monopoly giants to split Germany. When US imperialists set about turning West Germany into their war base and openly declared their intention to colonize the whole of Germany, all patriotic forces united to stop the conspiracies of US imperialism. In a unanimous decision, the German Democratic Republic was established as the cornerstone of the struggle for a unified, democratic Germany. Who could be more qualified to be elected President of the Republic than Wilhelm Pieck, a fighter against imperialism and for peace? His name enjoys a high reputation among all peace-loving people in the world.
　　Wilhelm Pieck embodies all the fine traditions and heroic achievements of the German revolutionary workers' movement. His selfless work for the interests of the working class and the people for decades is a model for all working people in the worker-peasant state, and it inspires them to work tirelessly for the construction of socialism and the happy life of the people.
　　For every German, Wilhelm Pieck is an example of the unyielding struggle against the rule of monopoly capital giants and landlords, against fascism and militarism. During his tenure as president, our republic has become a bastion of peace and democracy. Based on this, the peace-loving people of all countries place great trust in our republic, and this trust is best expressed in the "Treaty of Relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics."
　　Throughout his long life, Wilhelm Pieck has been working for friendship among the people of all countries in the spirit of proletarian internationalism. He was elected as a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International with the trust of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist and Workers' Parties of 52 countries around the world, until the dissolution of this committee. At the same time, he served as Chairman of the International Red Aid Committee. This great trust that Wilhelm Pieck enjoyed in the international workers' movement played a great role in strengthening the German Democratic Republic.
　　Wilhelm Pieck's life is an example of the unity of all peoples fighting for the cause of peace and democracy and for the elimination of any exploitation. The policy of international solidarity of peace-loving people also determines the content of the foreign policy of the German Democratic Republic today. As a sovereign and equal state, the German Democratic Republic is fraternally united with like-minded countries through the Warsaw Pact. The German Democratic Republic opposes the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization and supports the establishment of lasting peace through a European collective security system. This security system will also make it possible for Germany to establish unity on a peaceful and democratic basis.
　　The German Democratic Republic has taken deep root in the history of the German people, because it has learned lessons from German history. Those who have been riding on the heads of the German people for hundreds of years have been deprived of their power, and the people have embarked on the road of socialism. Only this road will lead our people to a better future. Leading this first German worker-peasant state is our Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, a warrior who has been tested by decades of struggle against capitalist exploitation and imperialism.
　　On the occasion of our President's 80th birthday, we wish him to be able to lead the German working class and all working people with full energy for many more years, and to continue to contribute his rich experience to the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

　　庆祝德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克80寿辰
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记　瓦尔特·乌布利希
    1956年1月3日，是第一个真正民主的德国——德意志民主共和国的总统、德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员威廉·皮克同志充满工作和斗争的一生整80年的日子。他的发展、活动和斗争，反映了德国工人阶级的优秀传统。
    威廉·皮克出身于工人家庭，19岁就参加了社会主义工人运动。他是成千上万虽然必须在资本主义企业中从事繁重的劳动，但仍把每一分钟空间的时间用来进行解放工人阶级的斗争的有阶级觉悟的工人之一。威廉·皮克根据本身的经验，熟悉普通人的生活和工人运动干部的辛勤工作，因此他对劳动人民有着最密切的休戚与共的感情。
    威廉·皮克在60年来的工会和政治活动中，担任过社会主义工人运动中的许多职务。他组织过罢工和选举大会，他当过鼓动家、组织家和宣传家。他把自己的一生献给反对德国军国主义和帝国主义战争和争取从资本主义剥削的枷锁下解放工人阶级的斗争。
    威廉·皮克在党内和群众团体中担任一切职务时都是从这个认识出发的：只有无产阶级才是自始至终进步和革命的阶级。他在政治工作中从来没有脱离过革命力量的源泉——群众。由于他为劳动人民的事业——和平和社会主义的事业进行了不调和的斗争，他获得了德国和国际无产阶级的尊敬和信任。
    威廉·皮克是在帝国主义战争危险日益增长的时期，从一个普通的党员发展成为反对德国帝国主义斗争的领袖的。德国金融资本争夺殖民地的斗争、德英矛盾的尖锐化和日俄战争是帝国主义矛盾尖锐的严重信号。随之而来的是德国阶级斗争的尖锐化。德国社会民主党内的机会主义分子那时鼓吹阶级矛盾的缓和，鼓吹和平走向社会主义的道路。列宁在本世纪初就曾严厉地批判过这种改良主义的思想，因为它使工人阶级容忍资本主义奴役，使他们不能起来反对帝国主义进行战争的企图。
    早在第一次世界大战以前，威廉·皮克就已属于以卡尔·李卜克内西、罗莎·卢森堡和弗兰兹·梅林为首的德国社会民主党左派了。他和他们一起向德国社会民主党内日益增长的资产阶级和帝国主义影响作斗争，并努力动员全党向资本主义剥削和压迫、向帝国主义进行斗争，动员全党为推翻资本主义阶级统治而坚持不渝地斗争。
    反对德国军国主义及其战争准备的斗争，是社会民主党左派斗争的一个重要标志。他们组织了反对军国主义的宣传，拥护国际社会党代表大会1907年斯图加特决议和1912年巴塞尔决议，这些决议反对准备帝国主义世界大战，要求把这场战争转变成为无产阶级的革命。
    随着第一次世界大战的爆发，当机会主义分子投入德国帝国主义阵营，并于1914年8月4日在国会投票赞成战争预算的时候，只有团结在卡尔·李卜克内西、罗莎·卢森堡、弗兰兹·梅林和威廉·皮克周围的那一群人才挽救了德国工人运动的荣誉，他们向帝国主义战争、向本国的主要敌人——康采恩和金融寡头进行了斗争。
    威廉·皮克在这个艰苦的时期里成为“国际”队以及后来的斯巴达克联盟组织者之一。无论是迫害或监狱都不能使他放弃对帝国主义战争及其发动者——大资本家和容克地主进行坚决斗争。
    随着世界历史的伟大转折——伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，德国工人阶级和德国人民面临着决定：立即同苏维埃俄国媾和或是继续战争，而战争就意味着德国的灾难。威廉·皮克从开始起就对英勇的苏联人民怀着亲密友好的感情。他孜孜不倦地向工人和人民群众说明，俄国建立工人阶级的统治也向德国人民提供了同苏维埃俄国友好地沿着和平、民主和社会主义道路前进的一切可能性。
    德国帝国主义在第一次世界大战中的失败，为德国工人阶级粉碎德国军火资本和容克地主的势力及其国家机器提供了良好的时机。由于缺少一个革命的政党，由于社会民主党和工会领袖出卖人民的社会和民族利益，以及由于工人阶级多数的资产阶级议会的幻想，工人阶级先锋队在1918年11月革命中遭到了失败。
    直到1918年底德国共产党的建立才为一个马克思列宁主义的群众性政党奠下了基石。威廉·皮克是德国共产党的创建者之一，并被选入党的中央委员会。从那时起他就一直是党的领导干部。卡尔·李卜克内西、罗莎·卢森堡和利奥·约基歇斯在党成立后不久就被杀害了。这样，刚成立的党在十分艰巨复杂的情况下失去了它的最优秀的和最著名的领袖。
    年轻的德国共产党英勇无畏地继承了被害战友的事业。它在白卫队警棍的追纵迫害的情况下团结了革命力量。德国共产党和独立社会民主党左翼——领导它的是像恩斯特·台尔曼这样卓越的工人领袖——合并以后成为一个群众性政党，在这方面威廉·皮克起了很大的作用。在努力把德国共产党建设和巩固成为马克思列宁主义的群众性政党的过程中，威廉·皮克一直把苏联共产党当作伟大的榜样；苏联共产党的领袖列宁和斯大林曾给予德国工人运动以无私的援助。
    在魏玛共和国时期，作为德国共产党领导的成员之一，威廉·皮克在动员群众反对逐步取消民主和经济上掠夺劳动人民、反对德国帝国主义和军国主义的再起方面起了领导的作用。他热情地争取社会民主党工人建立行动一致。威廉·皮克是要求建立伟大的反法西斯统一战线的最热心的忠告者之一。他在这段时期中的演说是火热的号召，对由于法西斯的胜利而遭受无限苦难的劳动人民充满着高度责任感。虽然他们竭尽了一切力量，但统治阶级在社会民主党和工会领袖的帮助下麻痹了工人阶级的多数，因此工人阶级的先锋队在孤立的情况下进行了反法西斯斗争。
    德国共产党在恩斯特·台尔曼的领导下从一开始起就称法西斯统治为好战狂的垄断资本的恐怖独裁。对希特勒政权的这种正确的评价反映在台尔曼的口号“希特勒就是战争！”里。德国共产党符合它的反帝斗争的伟大过去，在最艰苦的条件和最大牺牲的情况下仍坚定不移地继续了反对这种战争统治的斗争。德国工人阶级的领袖恩斯特·台尔曼是法西斯恐怖的最早牺牲者之一。德国共产党中央委员会委托威廉·皮克继承他的工作。威廉·皮克本着台尔曼的精神领导党坚持不渝地为建立工人统一战线和团结所有反对希特勒的人组成伟大的德国人民战线而斗争。
    在德国共产党政治局领导下的党的政策的目的是打倒希特勒以保卫和平。威廉·皮克要求所有爱好和平的德国人为了民族的利益，打倒战争贩子希特勒。当希特勒犯下他的最大罪行——进攻苏联时，威廉·皮克展开了广泛的反法西斯宣传。他积极地参加旨在促使战争早日结束和希特勒统治垮台的“自由德国民族委员会”的工作。
    苏联军队战胜希特勒法西斯主义以后，摆在德国人民面前的重大问题就是：怎样摆脱物质上和精神上的混乱状态，通过什么途径才能建立一个新的、反法西斯—民主的德国。1945年6月11日，以威廉·皮克同志为首的德国共产党中央委员会向工人阶级和全体劳动人民提出了拯救民族和重建德国的明确纲领。它的基本方针就是共产党和社会民主党的行动统一和团结一切民主力量共同合作。在这个号召中提出的首要任务是：清除希特勒统治的残余，建立民主政权。威廉·皮克的历史功绩就在于他和奥托·格罗提渥一起实现了建立一个统一的工人政党的目标，而这是在恩斯特·台尔曼领导下的共产党几十年来所努力争取的。吸取德国历史上痛苦的鲜血教训，克服几十年来工人运动不幸的分裂和建立一个领导争取和平、民主和社会主义斗争的统一的政党，——在这方面他比任何一个人起了更大的作用。马克思列宁主义在德国工人运动中取得了胜利。
    工人阶级统一的政党成为把人民中一切民主力量团结在民主德国全国阵线中的强大的发动力。民主德国全国阵线对美帝国主义勾结西德垄断巨头分裂德国的行为展开了斗争。当美国帝国主义者着手把西德变为他们的战争基地并公开地宣称要使全德国殖民地化的时候，所有爱国的力量就团结起来，制止美帝国主义的阴谋。在一致的决定下，作为争取一个统一、民主德国的基石的德意志民主共和国成立了。还有谁能比反对帝国主义和争取和平的战士威廉·皮克更有资格当选为共和国总统呢。他的名字在全世界一切爱好和平的人们中享有盛誉。
    威廉·皮克体现着德国革命工人运动所有优良传统和英勇业迹。他那几十年来为工人阶级和人民利益的忘我工作，是工农国家全体劳动人民的典范，并鼓舞他们为建设社会主义和人民的幸福生活而不倦地劳动。
    对每一个德国人来说，威廉·皮克是反对垄断资本巨头和地主的统治、反对法西斯主义和军国主义的不屈斗争的榜样。在他就任总统期间，我们共和国已成为和平和民主的堡垒。基于这一点，爱好和平的各国人民对我们共和国寄予巨大的信任，这种信任在“德意志民主共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟关系条约”中获得了最好的表现。
    威廉·皮克在他长长的一生中一直本着无产阶级国际主义的精神为各国人民间的友好而努力。他在苏联共产党和全世界52个国家的共产党和工人政党的信任下当选为共产国际执行委员会委员，一直到这个委员会解散为止。同时他担任了国际红色援助委员会主席。威廉·皮克在国际工人运动中所受到的这种巨大的信任，对增强德意志民主共和国起了很大的作用。
    威廉·皮克的一生是同为和平民主事业和为消灭任何剥削而斗争的各国人民团结一致的范例。爱好和平人民的国际团结这一政策，今天也决定着德意志民主共和国对外政策的内容。作为主权和平等的国家，德意志民主共和国通过华沙条约与志同道合的国家兄弟般地团结在一起。德意志民主共和国反对侵略性的北大西洋公约，拥护通过欧洲集体安全体系来建立持久的和平。这个安全体系也会使德国有可能在和平民主的基础上建立统一。
    德意志民主共和国已在德国人民的历史上根深蒂固了，因为这里从德国历史中吸取了教训。几百年来骑在德国人民头上的人被剥夺了权力，人民走上了社会主义的道路。只有这条路才把我国人民引向美好的未来。领导着这第一个德意志工农国家的是经过好几十年反对资本主义剥削和帝国主义斗争的考验的战士——我们的威廉·皮克同志。
    在我们总统80岁寿辰的时候，我们祝他能够精力饱满地再有许多年领导着德国工人阶级和全体劳动人民，继续把他的丰富经验贡献给争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争。
