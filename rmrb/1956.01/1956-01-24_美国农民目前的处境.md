    The current situation of the broad masses of American farmers is very difficult. Even U.S. President Eisenhower, in his "Agricultural Message" to Congress on January 9, said, "No problem requires the attention of Congress more urgently than the plight of American farmers." However, this message tries its best to conceal the real reasons for this situation; and the plans proposed in the message can only worsen the situation of the American farmers.

    The real reason for the current plight of the American farmers is mainly due to the fact that American agriculture entered a chronic crisis shortly after the end of World War II. And economic militarization has aggravated the severity of this crisis.

    Due to constant arms expansion and war preparations, the working people in the United States and other capitalist countries are becoming increasingly impoverished, and the market for agricultural products is shrinking. In recent years, although the U.S. government has taken many measures to reduce the difficulty of selling agricultural products, the sales of American agricultural products in domestic and foreign markets have still encountered serious difficulties. American agricultural products that cannot be sold are piling up day by day. The value of the agricultural products accumulated by the U.S. "Commodity Credit Corporation" increased by 1.2 billion U.S. dollars from April 30, 1954, to April 30, 1955; by the end of 1955, the total value of accumulated agricultural products reached an unprecedented record of 8 billion U.S. dollars.

    As the number of agricultural products piled up and unable to be sold increases, the prices at which farmers sell their products are also decreasing. Although the U.S. government has implemented an artificial price maintenance policy, it cannot offset the force of the deepening crisis, and the downward trend of farmers' selling prices continues to develop. According to official U.S. figures, the average purchase price of agricultural products in 1955 was about 5% lower than in 1954; equivalent to 85% of the "parity price" (government support price), which was 89% in 1954.

    But on the other hand, farmers' expenditure prices, including the purchase of various industrial products, the payment of loan interest, etc., are all rising, and unequal exchange is intensifying. According to U.S. official wholesale price data, the price levels of industrial and agricultural products were similar in 1951 (with 1947-1949 as 100); but from 1951 to May 1955, the gap between the prices of industrial and agricultural products increased by more than 20%. According to preliminary figures, this gap reached its highest level since the end of World War II in July 1955, almost reaching 25%.

    The decline in the prices at which farmers sell agricultural products has not brought any benefits to consumers. Moreover, the share that farmers get in consumers' buying prices is getting lower and lower. For example, according to official U.S. materials, the prices of farm products in general were 10% lower last November than the year before, but retail grain prices only decreased by 2%. The difference went into the pockets of agricultural monopoly capitalists. The share farmers got in the consumers’ buying price, in the value of one dollar's worth of grain, dropped to 39 cents last November, which is the lowest figure in 15 years.

    As a result, American agricultural income decreases year by year, and it has been declining continuously for five years. According to official U.S. materials, the annual agricultural income figures after deducting production costs from 1951 to 1955 are: 16 billion U.S. dollars in 1951, 14.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1952, 12.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1953, 12 billion U.S. dollars in 1954, and 10.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1955. It is estimated that it will continue to decline in 1956.

    This reduction in agricultural income does not affect all farmers equally, because the amount of income varies greatly among different farms. The essay "Farm Annexation," published in the American magazine "Daily Review" in October 1955, cited 1950 data to illustrate that 2% of all farms, with product values ​​of no less than 25,000 U.S. dollars, owned more than a quarter of all agricultural income; 9% of all farms, with product values ​​of no less than 10,000 U.S. dollars, received more than half of all agricultural income; 75% of all farms, with product values ​​of 5,000 U.S. dollars or less, received less than one-fifth of all agricultural income. This shows that the decline in agricultural income primarily hits the broad masses of working farmers.

    The income of small and medium-sized farmers is becoming less and less, while the burden of debt and taxes is greatly increased, and land rents are constantly increasing, so the broad masses of working farmers are becoming increasingly impoverished.

    This situation is being used by American monopoly capitalists and large farm owners to accelerate the basic trend of American agriculture, that is, large farms constantly annex and eliminate small and medium-sized farms. According to the latest U.S. official survey report, the number of U.S. farms decreased by 600,000 between 1950 and 1954, that is, by more than one-tenth; the total number of farms in 1954 was the lowest since 1890. Most of the eliminated farms are smaller farms, while large farms are increasing. From 1945 to 1950, the number of large farms in the southern states of the United States doubled, the number of medium-sized farms decreased by 20%, and the number of small farms decreased by 38%. The development process of the survival of the fittest has reached such a degree that, in 1950, 116,000 of the largest farms out of the 5.4 million farms in the United States almost concentrated half of all the land owned by farm occupants; 32.3% of the total number of farms held 83.3% of the total agricultural commodities, while the remaining 67.7% of the farms only held 36.7% of the total agricultural commodities. The extreme poverty that plagues most of the American agricultural population can also be seen from the fact that 2.3 million farmers have been forced to leave the countryside since 1951.

    The above facts show that the deepening of the agricultural crisis, marked by economic militarization, has made the situation of the broad masses of American farmers worse than before. But the U.S. government is using the acceleration of the bankruptcy of small and medium-sized farmers as a policy to save the agricultural crisis. The plan proposed in this "Agricultural Message" precisely embodies this characteristic.

    The most important content of the plan proposed in the "Agricultural Message" is to establish a "land bank" and sell government-owned "surplus" agricultural products at reduced prices in the domestic market. The purpose of establishing the "land bank" is to accelerate the effort to reduce the cultivated land area by 25 million acres, accounting for 20% of the cultivated land area, in order to reduce the production of major agricultural products such as cotton, wheat, corn, rice, and peanuts. The British magazine "Economist" revealed on December 17 last year that this is mainly to deal with about "2 million" households with an "average income of 4,000 U.S. dollars per year." With the "subsidy" of the "land bank," they will "not grow basic crops" or "cannot be used to produce crops for a period of time." This will inflict a new blow on these farmers whose annual income is already unable to maintain the most frugal basic living standards. The facts of the past few years show that reducing the sown area is unfavorable for small and medium-sized farmers. Precisely because of this, they have tried their best to maintain the original sown area despite the continuous decline in agricultural product prices. As for large farm owners, after reducing a portion of the sown area of crops, on the one hand, they can receive subsidies for reducing the sown area, and on the other hand, they can increase output by strengthening the management of their own farms, which will not cause them any losses.

    As for reducing the prices of government-owned "surplus" agricultural products in the domestic market, the message also admits that the government's doing so will compete with the agricultural products sold by the farmers themselves, which will further reduce the prices of agricultural products in the domestic market and reduce the income of farmers. This primarily hits the broad masses of small and medium-sized farmers. Large farm owners have already benefited from the government's support prices and will continue to receive this benefit. Reducing the prices of government-owned "surplus" agricultural products in the domestic market will not harm them. Democratic Senator Humphrey criticized this practice, saying, "This is to relieve Ezra's (U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Benson's name) burden of surplus agricultural products and put this burden on farmer Jones (referring to general farmers)."

    1956 is the U.S. presidential election year. Now the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States are working hard to win the votes of farmers. However, even President Eisenhower himself said that the agricultural plan proposed in this message is "not a panacea." Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson said on the one hand that these plans were originally proposed by Democrats; at the same time, he also said that whether these suggestions will be of any direct help to farmers is still "very questionable." The fact is that the set of methods proposed in the plan will not only fail to alleviate the deteriorating situation of small and medium-sized farmers, but will instead push more small and medium-sized farmers out of agricultural production, making their situation even worse.

    The American farmers are very dissatisfied with the government's policies. Iowa Farmers Union leader Stowell has expressed opinions on Eisenhower's failure to abide by his campaign promises, and these opinions reflect the sentiments of small and medium-sized farmers. He said, "In my opinion, this is the most obvious act of political betrayal, and this act of betrayal is also reflected in agriculture." What the American farmers demand is the implementation of a policy of peaceful economy that raises domestic living standards and develops peaceful and mutually beneficial trade relations with other countries.

    The policy of arms expansion and war preparation has deepened the U.S. agricultural crisis; the development of the agricultural crisis has caused the sharpening of class contradictions in American rural society. The American farmers' opposition to the government's policy of intensifying arms expansion and war preparation will also rise as a result.

    美国农民目前的处境
    钦本立
    美国广大农民群众目前的处境十分困难，美国总统艾森豪威尔在1月9日向国会提出的“农业咨文”中也说，“没有一个问题像美国的农民处境那样迫切需要国会注意的”。然而，这个咨文对于造成这种情况的真正原因却竭力加以掩盖；而咨文中提出的计划也只能使美国农民群众的处境愈益恶化。
    造成美国农民群众目前处境十分困难的真正原因，主要由于第二次大战结束后不久，美国农业即已进入慢性危机。而经济军事化造成了这个危机的严重性。
    由于不断的扩军备战，美国和其他资本主义国家的劳动人民日益贫困，农产品销售市场日益缩小。几年来，美国政府为了减少农产品的销售困难，虽然采取了许多措施，但是，美国农产品在国内和国外市场的销售还是发生了严重的困难。美国推销不出去的农产品一天天堆积起来。美国“商品信贷公司”所拥有的积存的农产品价值，从1954年4月30日到1955年4月30日增加了12亿美元；到1955年底拥有的积存的农产品总值达到80亿美元的空前纪录。
    随着堆积起来无法销售的农产品的增多，农民出售产品的价格也日益降低。虽然，美国政府实行了人为的维持价格的政策，也无法抵消危机加深的力量，农民出售产品价格下降趋势仍在继续发展。根据美国官方数字，1955年农产品收购价格平均比1954年低5％左右；相当于“平价”（政府的支持价格）的85％，在1954年是89％。
    但另一方面，农民的支出价格，包括购买各种工业品、支付贷款利息等都在上涨，不等价交换加剧。根据美国官方批发物价的资料，1951年工业品和农产品的价格水平（1947年——1949年为100）是相接近的；但从1951年到1955年5月这一期间，工业品和农产品价格之间的差距增大了20％以上。根据初步数字，1955年7月这种差距已达到第二次大战结束后的最高水平，差不多达到25％。
    农民出售农产品价格的下降，不但没有给消费者带来什么好处，并且，农民在消费者的买价中所得的份额愈来愈低。譬如，根据美国官方的材料，去年11月份农场产品价格一般地说都比前年降低10％，但粮食零售价格只降低2％，两者之间的差额落到农业垄断资本家的钱袋里去了。但农民在消费者的买价中所得到的份额，在价值一美元的粮食中，去年11月份降到3角9分，这是15年来最低的数字。
    因而，美国农业收入年年减少，现在已经连续下降了5年。根据美国官方的材料，自1951年到1955年减去生产成本以后的逐年农业收入数字是：1951年160亿美元，1952年142亿美元，1953年123亿美元，1954年120亿美元，1955年107亿美元。估计1956年还将继续下降。
    农业收入的这种降低，对全体农场主的影响不是相等的。因为各种农场收入的多少是区别很大的。1955年10月份美国杂志“每日评论”刊登的“农场吞并”这篇论文，引用1950年的材料说明，产品价值不少于25，000美元的、占全体农场2％的农场，拥有全部农业收入的四分之一以上；产品价值不少于一万美元的，占全部农场9％的农场，得到全部农业收入的一半以上；产品价值为5，000美元或5，000美元以下的，占全部农场四分之三的农场，却得不到全部农业收入的五分之一。这说明农业收入的减少首先打击了广大劳动农民。
    小、中农户收入愈来愈少，而债务和捐税负担大大加重，地租不断增加，广大劳动农民也就愈来愈贫困。
    这种情况，正被美国垄断资本家和大农场主利用来加速美国农业的基本趋势，即大农经常地吞并和消灭小、中农。根据美国官方最近一次调查报告，美国农场数目自1950年到1954年之间减少了60万个，即减少十分之一多；1954年农场总数为1890年以来最少的一年。被消灭的农场大部分是较小的农场，而大农场在增加。1945年到1950年美国南部各州大农场数目增加了一倍，中等农场的数目减少了20％，小农场的数目减少了38％。弱肉强食的发展过程达到了这样的程度：1950年美国全部农场540万个农场中，116，000个最大的农场几乎集中了农场占有者全部所有土地的一半；农场总数的32.3％的农场握有农业商品总数的83.3％，而余下的67.7％的农场只握有农业商品总数的36.7％。折磨大多数美国农业人口的极端贫困，还可从下面的事实看出来：从1951年以来，有230万农民被迫离开了农村。
    以上事实说明，以经济军事化为标志的农业危机的加深，使得美国广大农民群众的处境比从前更为恶化。但美国政府却以加速小、中农破产来作为挽救农业危机的政策。这次“农业咨文”所提出的计划正表现了这个特色。
    “农业咨文”所提出的计划最重要的内容，是建立一个“土地银行”，并在国内市场削价出售政府拥有的“剩余”农产品。建立“土地银行”的目的，就是加速设法缩减耕地面积2，500万英亩，占耕地面积的20％，以此来减少主要的农产品棉花、小麦以及玉米、大米、花生的生产。去年12月17日英国“经济学家”杂志透露，这主要是对付约“200万个”、“平均每户收入每年4，000美元”的农户的。在“土地银行”的“补助”下，使他们“不种基本作物”，或者“在一个时期内不能用来生产农作物”。这就使这些每年收入本来已不能维持最俭朴的起码生活水平的农户遭到新的打击。过去几年的事实表明，缩减播种面积对于小、中农是不利的。正因为这样，所以尽管农产品价格连年下降，他们还是竭力保持原来的播种面积。至于大农场主，缩减一部分农作物播种面积以后，一方面，可以领取缩小播种面积的补助金，一方面却用加强管理自己农场的办法来增加产量，这就使他们不会受到什么损失。
    至于在国内市场削减政府拥有的“剩余”农产品价格，咨文也承认，政府这样做将和农民自己出售的农产品发生竞争，这样也就会进一步降低国内市场的农产品价格，减少农民的收入，这主要打击了广大的小、中农。大农场主，他们从政府的支持价格中已经得到了好处。并将继续得到这种好处。在国内市场削减政府拥有的“剩余”农产品价格对他们没有什么损害。民主党参议员汉弗莱指责这种做法说：“这是解除伊兹拉（美农业部长本逊名）的剩余农产品的负担而把这个负担加在农民琼斯（泛指一般农民）的身上。”
    1956年是美国总统的选举年。现在美国的共和党和民主党正在努力争取农民的选票。但是，这个咨文提出的农业计划，连艾森豪威尔总统自己也说，“这并不是一剂万灵药”。民主党上届总统候选人史蒂文森一方面说，这些计划本来都是由民主党人提出的；同时又说，这些建议是否对农民有任何直接的帮助还是“非常成问题的”。事实是，计划中提出的一套办法不仅不能缓和小、中农日益恶化的情况，相反，将使更多的小、中农从农业生产中被排挤出去，使他们的境况更加恶化。
    美国农民群众对政府政策表示非常不满。伊阿华州农会领导人斯托威尔对于艾森豪威尔不遵守竞选诺言的做法曾提出意见，这些意见反映了小、中农户的心情。他说，“依我看来，这是最明显的政治上的变节行为，这种变节行为也表现在农业方面”。美国农民群众要求的是实行以提高国内生活水平，并且和其他国家发展和平的、互利的贸易关系的和平经济的政策。
    扩军备战的政策加深了美国农业危机；农业危机的发展引起了美国农村社会阶级矛盾的尖锐化。美国农民群众反对政府所实行的加紧扩军备战的政策的情绪也将因此高涨。
