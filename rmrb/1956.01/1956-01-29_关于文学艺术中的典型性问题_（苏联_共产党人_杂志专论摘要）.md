    On the Issue of Typicality in Literature and Art
    (Abstract of a Special Article from the Soviet "Kommunist" Magazine)
    The theoretical and political magazine of the Central Committee of the CPSU, "Kommunist," published an editorial article in its 18th issue of 1955 entitled "On the Issue of Typicality in Literature and Art." The following is a summary of the article's contents.
    The article points out that in recent years, certain sophistical and erroneous views on the issue of typicality in artistic creation have been spreading in literary and artistic circles. Some formulas have been widely disseminated, namely, that the typical is the essence of a certain socio-historical phenomenon, and that the typical is defined as the basic scope of the expression of Party spirit in realistic art. It is asserted that the issue of typicality is always a political issue, and that only the conscious exaggeration of artistic images can more fully explore and emphasize their typicality. These sophistical formulas are masquerading as Marxist formulas and are erroneously linked to our Party's views on literature and art.
    This article points out that the aforementioned sophistical formulas concerning typicality have had a detrimental impact on the development of Soviet literature and art and on the study of aesthetic issues.
        ×　×　×
    This article points out that the definition that the typical is merely consistent with the essence of a certain social force or the essence of a certain socio-historical phenomenon is one-sided and incomplete; this definition departs from the vivid practice of artistic creation and does not take into account the characteristics of art's cognition and reflection of the world. This definition highlights only one aspect and neglects the difference between art and other forms of thought.
    However, it is not enough to simply point out the commonalities in forms of thought. It is also necessary to determine the special and specific things that distinguish these forms from each other. Historians, economists, and philosophers also study social life in order to reveal the essence of certain social forces and certain social phenomena, but this does not make them artists. Art is a special form of reflecting reality. The artistic understanding of life has its own laws, which are very different from the laws of scientific understanding. Typification is one of the basic laws of art and an extremely important factor in the characteristics of artistic creation. Unlike science, art reflects the laws of reality through images, that is, through concrete and perceptual forms, embodying the general in the particular. In realistic art, all facts and life phenomena are expressed in the form of life itself, rather than in the naked abstract concepts of social essence. To regard the typical as merely the embodiment of the essence of a certain social force would cause artistic works to lose the diversity of life's individuality, leading to the creation of formulas rather than artistic images. This sophistical formula guides creators not to engage in artistic discovery, but to illustrate general principles.
    Artists reveal social relations through types. He depicts images of representatives of different strata and classes, revealing their connections, conflicts, and struggles in typical environments and conflicts, and in plots. The most important thing that artists strive for is to create vivid and personalized characters that can embody the common characteristics of a certain type of person.
    Engels pointed out that in the hands of a true artist, "every character is a type, yet at the same time a definite individual, as old Hegel puts it, 'this one'."
    Therefore, typification is inextricably linked to the ability to create the character of individual people, and to show the complex and multifaceted important connections and relationships through their fate, behavior and activities.
    Critics who ignore this aspect of art's reflection of life, and one-sidedly reduce it merely to the expression of the essence of a certain social force, cannot make a profound analysis of artistic works. Because this view deprives critics of the possibility of judging the quality and characteristics of the images created by artists, and is an evaluation of the artist's intentions, rather than an evaluation of the reality created by the artist, thus eliminating high aesthetic requirements.
    Revolutionary democratic criticism, great writers, and Marxist-Leninist classical writers have always emphasized the significance of personalization, considering it an indispensable condition for creating typical images.
    In his letter to Inessa Armand, Lenin profoundly pointed out that in artistic works "... the most important thing is the unique environment, the analysis of character, and the analysis of certain typical psychology." The demand for deep personalization of artistic images is one of the basic requirements of socialist realist aesthetics.

    This article points out that the principle of Party spirit in literature put forward by Lenin is a further development of the Marxist doctrine on the class nature of literature and art. This is Lenin's extremely important contribution to the science of literature and art, and a great achievement of aesthetic thought. Correctly clarifying the role of worldview in literature and art, and clarifying the significance and essence of the principle of Party spirit, is of extremely important theoretical and practical significance.
    However, it must also be pointed out here that there is a sophistical understanding of Party spirit in the field of art, which is particularly manifested in these aspects: treating the typical and the Party-spirited as the same thing, and treating the typical as the basic scope of the expression of Party spirit in realistic art. Reducing the typical to merely political things. It is not difficult to see that this confused view will lead people to treat literary and artistic phenomena with an anti-historical attitude, without considering the era and conditions of the artist's creation, without making a profound analysis of the artist's worldview. The attempt to find the expression of a Party-spirited position in everything typical will inevitably lead to blurring the concrete historical content of the principle of Party spirit in literature and art. This attitude is entirely based on dogmatism. They seize upon Lenin's instruction that "modern philosophy is partisan, just like philosophy two thousand years ago," and forcibly apply literary and artistic phenomena to this instruction, without asking what specific meaning Lenin gave to this term, nor how Lenin's other instructions on the issue of Party spirit speak. It is impossible to understand the principle of Party spirit in literature and art with a bookish spirit, it is necessary to study the essence of the issue more deeply.
    Lenin raised the question "Is there a Party spirit in philosophy in general..." in his book "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," and said: "One cannot but see the partisan struggle in philosophy, which ultimately expresses the tendencies and ideologies of mutually antagonistic classes in modern society. Modern philosophy is partisan, just like philosophy two thousand years ago. Even if disguised by new terms masquerading as erudition or extremely stupid non-partisanship, the mutually fighting parties are essentially materialism and idealism."
    It can be seen that Lenin here speaks of the partisan struggle in philosophy as the struggle between the parties of materialism and idealism, while pointing out that idealism has always represented the tendencies and ideologies of reactionary classes.
    If the above understanding of Party spirit is mechanically moved to the field of literature and art, there will be a danger of vulgarization. Everyone knows that in artistic creation, the author's political views are often not as directly expressed as in philosophy or other social sciences. There are even often situations where the objective significance of the artist's created works contradicts his political views and sympathies. In this regard, as Engels pointed out, Balzac's creation is a clear example. The same situation can be seen in the works of other great artists in the past. Therefore, it is never permissible to simply divide all artists into two politically opposing parties. The basis for those who advocate making such a division is that there has never been anything but reactionary art and progressive art. There is no doubt that this is a correct principle. However, people have drawn wrong conclusions from this principle, and based on this conclusion, progressiveness and Party spirit are confused. In this definition, the specific content of Party spirit disappears. Not only that, but this definition also provides an argument that progressive artists of various eras, despite belonging to different classes, are all representatives of the same Party-spirited position. Those researchers who treat the instruction that there are various parties in philosophy with a dogmatic attitude, have reached such an absurd degree by applying this instruction to literature and art and talking a lot about their reactionary parties and progressive parties. As a result, in the eyes of these researchers, Griboyedov, Chernyshevsky, and Gorky all belong to the same party camp of writers.
    Lenin did not regard the concept of Party spirit as an abstract and all-encompassing category. Lenin revealed the specific content of Party spirit based on certain historical circumstances. Lenin believed that Party spirit is the result of highly developed class struggle. He taught us that Party spirit "...requires that in making any estimate of events, one must frankly and openly stand on the position of a certain social group." Lenin wrote: "Because no living person can fail to stand on the side of this or that class (if he understands their interrelationships), can fail to rejoice in the victory of that class, and grieve in its failure, can fail to express anger at those who are hostile to this class, at those who spread backward views to hinder its development, and so on."
    It can be seen that what is spoken of here is the position of conscious Party spirit, which is premised on the understanding of the interrelationships of various classes, and is premised on the enthusiastic support of the interests of the class to which people belong. It was precisely such a thought that Lenin expressed in his famous essay "Party Organization and Party Literature" in 1905, in which the principle of Party spirit in literature and art was first expressed. Starting from this understanding of the principle of Party spirit, can we count the realistic artists of different eras who have created diverse typical images in the category of Party-spirited writers, as the formula that typicality is the basic scope of the expression of Party spirit requires? Obviously, it is not possible.
    Vulgar sociology has collapsed. Now no one dares, as the most extreme vulgar sociologists did before, to reduce Pushkin and Gogol's creations to reflections of the interests of small landlords or middle-ranking nobles. However, if all the great realistic artists in history are thoroughly called Party-spirited artists, they are bound to be listed as staunch and conscious defenders and supporters of the working class. But no one dares to make such an unscientific far-fetched association. Thus, the sophistical formula falls through. It prevents people from correctly analyzing the specific phenomena of literary history. However, the populism of the creations of many great artists who belonged to the ruling and exploiting classes by birth and upbringing is inseparable from their ability to break through the narrow framework of the interests of their own class, and is inseparable from their ability to promote the development of the trend of striving for liberation with their objective and truthful descriptions of reality (even if they do not openly stand on the position of the masses of the people). The result of trying to associate the creations of such artists with Party spirit in the true sense can only be vulgarization.
    Or we take the creation of modern progressive realistic artists in capitalist countries as an example. Now, among these artists, there are not many who consciously and firmly link their creations with the working class and with the policies of the Communist Party. For various reasons, they have not yet accepted the principle of Party spirit in art, and some even stay far away from it.
    If one believes the sophistical formula, these artists cannot create typical images, because the typical is the scope of the expression of Party spirit. However, these artists strive to faithfully and truthfully reflect life, they are creating vivid and typical images, and they are serving the progressive cause with their creations. There is no doubt that once they raise themselves to the level of openly and firmly serving the interests of the workers, they will become more active and militant educators of the masses; but this is a matter for the future, and it depends on the ability of the Communist Parties of various countries to attract progressive intellectuals to their side.
    The issue of the worldviews of artists of different eras and different classes is an extremely complex issue. Concrete research on literary and artistic phenomena shows that the worldviews of artists are often very contradictory, and this situation cannot but be reflected in their creations. Lenin's analysis of Tolstoy's creations is the most obvious proof of this fact. Party spirit is premised on the conscious and clear class nature of the worldview, and not all artists have this clarity. Communist Party spirit—the basic ideological principle of the artistic method of socialist literature—is the highest expression of this clarity of worldview.
    The article points out: In his essay "Party Organization and Party Literature," Lenin put forward the idea of Party literature and gave it new historical content. What is spoken of here is precisely communist Party spirit, which is considered the basis for creating truly popular art. True popular art "serves tens of millions of working people. These working people are the essence of the country, the strength of the country, and the future of the country."
    It is obvious that the historical and concrete content of the concept of Party spirit in literature and art cannot be simplified and sophistically linked with the typification of all artists of all eras.
    It should also be clearly seen that our Party spirit in literature and art is fundamentally different from bourgeois Party spirit. The creations of Soviet writers and artists are Party-spirited, and at the same time reflect the objective truth of life in typical artistic images, reflecting the objective laws of our country's development on which the policies of the Communist Party are based. The method of socialist realism requires artistic creation to proceed from facts and vivid real phenomena, rather than from subjective imagination and wishes. True communist Party spirit runs counter to all manifestations of subjectivism, and runs counter to the practice of turning characters into simple mouthpieces of ideas, forcing characters to accept ideas and feelings that are not inherent in their characters.
    Because communist Party spirit represents the interests of the broadest strata of working people, it is the highest expression of populism.
        ×　×　×
    The article also points out that recently, people often sanctify some methods of artistic typification based on sophistical formulas. There is an opinion that the creation of typical images must be consciously exaggerated, as if conscious exaggeration can more fully explore and emphasize typicality in any occasion.
    The history of art and literature over many centuries convincingly proves that the means and techniques of typification, and the methods of creating typical images are diverse and endless. These methods and means are constantly developed and enriched along with the development of human art. The diversity of typification methods is determined by many factors: the characteristics of the specific artistic forms and styles used by the artist to create, the artist's ideological tasks, creative tasks, and so on.
    The artistic principles and methods of creating typical images are different in novels and lyric works or satirical works, and dramatic works also have their own laws and their own methods of creating typical characters. The object of description and the attitude of description itself, and the creative method followed by the artist, all have a decisive influence on the method of typification in creative practice.
    Ignoring all the complexity of artistic practice and the development of literature and art, and sanctifying certain typification methods and groundlessly asserting that these methods are superior to many other methods can only bring harm. The diversity of artistic methods of typification must never be reduced to exaggeration.
    The experience of realistic literature in the past and the experience of our Soviet literature show that artists only adopt the method of exaggeration in the exaggerated sense when solving special and specific artistic tasks. This method is often used in satirical literature or romantic works, such as Gorky's early works. However, if we look at Gorky's realistic masterpiece, we can see that he rarely uses this literal exaggeration technique. However, in theoretical works, Gorky has repeatedly talked about his advocacy of exaggeration. Only those who treat the words of great writers with a bookish spirit would imagine that Gorky regards exaggeration in the exaggerated sense as a universal and panacea-like method of typification.
    But in what sense did Gorky use the term exaggeration? He understood exaggeration as "extensive typification of phenomena," the ability of artists to stand above phenomena, see the connections between them, understand their significance, find the special, and express the universal in these special things, that is, create artistic images with great generality and significance. Gorky has talked about this more than once in his essays and speeches. He said: "All great works, all works that have become models of highly artistic literature, are built on exaggeration, built on the foundation of extensive typification of phenomena."
    Gorky put forward such a request in order to fight more deeply and vividly for the expression of the Soviet people, and to oppose the phenomenon of literature lagging behind life.
    Gorky said: "Our real and living heroic figures who are creating socialist culture are more noble and greater than the heroic figures in our novels and novellas. They should be portrayed more greatly and more vividly in literature...."
    In these and other remarks of Gorky, exaggeration is not a method of typification, but is consistent with the concept of the type itself. Therefore, it should be pointed out that Gorky has always paid great attention to artistic fantasy and the artist's ability to "imagine" when selecting facts and life phenomena when talking about typification. This "imagination" based on real life is not inconsistent with the realism of art. However, dogmatists have seized upon "exaggeration" in the literal sense and attempted to turn it into an instruction that must be observed in all occasions and in all forms and styles of literature and art.
    The unconditional demand for exaggeration has already brought no small amount of harm to our art and literature. Some creators and critics understand exaggeration as the need to exaggerate the phenomena of reality, which has led to departing from the essence of socialist realism—truthfully reflecting reality in the revolutionary development of reality. This exaggeration has begun to lead to the destruction of the basic laws of realistic art, which requires that artistic images be consistent with the truth of life.
    The theoretical confusion about the issue of exaggeration has to some extent contributed to the emergence of some works that wrongly reflect Soviet reality, especially some works that embellish reality.
    In fact, if we proceed from the principle of consciously exaggerating the positive phenomena in reality (because, it is said that only in this way can the essence of a certain social force be most fully expressed), then the result will be to ignore the actual reality, skip the difficulties of our construction, and even skip its stages. This method of describing life cannot correctly point out the direction to readers, nor can it correctly educate them.
    The emergence of various kinds of dubious arguments about the special characters of types is also related to this erroneous theory, according to which special phenomena are rare phenomena. However, in realistic art, rare phenomena can only become typical phenomena when they reflect the budding of new things, and these buddings always make themselves possess the potential power of the masses.
    Rare phenomena can only become typical phenomena when they are related to regular phenomena, rather than to accidental phenomena. Separating typical phenomena from mass phenomena, opposing typical phenomena to mass phenomena, and regarding typical phenomena as special phenomena—this is what leads people to create characters that are not real, but fabricated and pretentious.
    However, sometimes some unhealthy emotions are mixed with this healthy protest, and individual critics shout what the demand to express ordinary Soviet people is lowered to taking mediocrity as the standard. They use this reason to oppose the creation of images of advanced people who serve as role models. If we go down this path, it will be an extremely serious mistake. It is the bounden duty of writers—fighters on the ideological front—to use the weapons of their artistic language to support the budding of new things in all areas of life, and to promote the advanced experience of communist construction.
    The great danger associated with the formula of exaggeration understood by sophistry also lies in the fact that it leads people to exaggerate the description of negative phenomena in reality. As a result, Soviet reality is distorted. This erroneous tendency is particularly sharply manifested in many articles published in the magazine "New World," and in Zorin's "The Guest" and Virta's "The Death of Pombeyev" and other plays. Soviet public opinion and the press resolutely condemned these works.
    Just as readers do not believe in people who are praised to the skies, readers will not believe that exaggerated villains can sway unpunished on our land, because this is a distortion of the perspective and is opposed to actual reality.
        ×　×　×
    The final part of the article writes: Studying the theoretical issues of art correctly and effectively is one of the current urgent tasks. We have many instructions from Marxist-Leninist classical writers, remarks from great writers and critics, and the rich experience of the vivid development of literature and art. It is necessary to eliminate sophistry and dogmatism in aesthetics. Doing so will open up a broad path for the comprehensive study of the issue of typicality and other important aesthetic issues. Doing so will promote the practice of our country's literature and art, and open up broad prospects for achieving new achievements and for creating new works of high artistic level worthy of the people who are building communism.

    关于文学艺术中的典型性问题
    （苏联“共产党人”杂志专论摘要）
    苏共中央的理论政治杂志“共产党人”1955年第18期上刊载了编辑部的一篇专论“关于文学艺术中的典型性问题”。下面是文章内容的摘要。
    论文指出：近年来，在文学艺术界传播着对于艺术创作中的典型性问题的某些烦琐哲学的、错误的观点。有一些公式得到了广泛的传播，即认为典型的东西是一定社会历史现象的本质，并且把典型的东西规定为党性在现实主义艺术中的表现的基本范围，断定说，典型性问题任何时候都是一个政治性的问题，而且只有艺术形象的有意识的夸张，才能够更加充分地发掘和强调它的典型性。这些烦琐哲学的公式竟冒充为马克思主义的公式，并且错误地和我们党对文学艺术问题的观点联系起来。
    这篇论文指出：上述关于典型性的烦琐哲学的公式，已经给苏联文学艺术的发展、给美学问题的研究，带来了有害的影响。
        ×　×　×
    这篇论文指出：把典型的东西仅仅规定为和一定社会力量的本质、和一定社会历史现象的本质相一致的这种定义是片面的，不完全的；这个定义离开了艺术创作的生动实践，没有考虑到艺术对世界的认识和反映的特点。在这一定义中，只是把一个方面突出地提出来，而忽略了艺术和其他思想形式的区别。
    但是，光是指出思想形式中的共同点是不够的。还必须确定特殊的、专门的、能够使这些形式彼此区别开来的东西。要知道，历史学家，经济学家，哲学家为了揭示一定社会力量、一定社会现象的本质，也在研究社会生活，但是，这并不能使他们成为艺术家。艺术——这是反映现实的特殊形式。对生活的艺术的认识有它自己的规律，是跟科学的认识的规律，大不相同的。典型化是艺术的基本规律之一，它是艺术创作特点的极其重要的因素。和科学不同，艺术反映现实的规律是用形象，也就是说是用具体的感性的形式，是在个别的东西里体现一般的东西。在现实主义的艺术里，一切事实和生活现象，都是以生活本身的形式、而不是以社会的本质的赤裸裸的抽象概念表现出来的。把典型的东西仅仅看成一定社会力量的本质的体现，就会使艺术作品失去生活的个性的多样性，就会引导到创造公式，而不是创造艺术形象。这种烦琐哲学的公式引导创作工作者不去进行艺术的发现，而是去图解一般原理。
    艺术家是通过典型来表明社会关系的。他描写各个不同阶层、阶级的代表人物的形象，在典型环境和冲突中，在情节中揭示他们的联系、冲突和斗争。艺术家努力追求的最主要的东西是创造出鲜明的个性化的性格，而这性格又能够体现出某一类人的共同的特点。
    恩格斯指出，在真正的艺术家的笔下，“每一个人物都是典型，然而同时又是明确的个性，正如黑格尔老人所说的，‘这一个’。”
    因此，典型化是和创造个别人物的性格、通过他们的命运、行为和活动来表明复杂的多方面的重要联系和关系的才能，有着不可分割的联系的。
    批评家忽略艺术反映生活的这一方面，片面地把它仅仅归结为一定社会力量的本质的表现，就不能对艺术作品作深刻的分析。因为这种看法使批评家失去判断艺术家所创造的形象的质量和特色的可能，是对艺术家的意图作估价，而不是对艺术家所创造出来的现实的东西作估价，这样就取消了高度的美学的要求。
    革命民主主义的评论，伟大作家，马克思列宁主义经典作家，从来都强调指出个性化的意义，认为它是创造典型形象的必不可少的条件。
    列宁在给依内谢·阿尔曼德的信中，极其深刻地指出，在艺术作品中“……最重要的就是独特的环境，就是性格的分析以及一定的典型的心理的分析”。对艺术形象的深刻的个性化的要求，这是社会主义现实主义美学的基本要求之一。
        ×　×　×
    这篇论文指出：列宁所提出的文学党性原则，是马克思主义关于文学和艺术的阶级性的学说的进一步的发展，这是列宁对文学艺术的科学的极其重大的贡献，是美学思想的伟大的成果。正确地阐明世界观在文学艺术中的作用，阐明党性原则的意义和实质，是具有极其重大的理论和实践的意义的。
    但是，在这里也不能不指出，对艺术领域中的党性存在着烦琐哲学的理解方法，它特别表现在这些方面：把典型的东西和党性的东西看作是同一的东西，把典型的东西看作是党性在现实主义艺术中的表现的基本范围。把典型的东西仅仅归结为政治性的东西。不难看出，这种混淆的看法会使人们以反历史主义的态度去对待文学艺术现象，不考虑艺术家创作的时代和条件，对艺术家的世界观不作深刻的分析，想在一切典型的东西中间找出党性立场的表现的企图，必然导致模糊文学艺术中的党性原则的具体的历史内容。这种态度完全是从教条主义出发的。他们抓住了列宁的“现代哲学是有党派性的，正像两千年前的哲学一样”这一指示，把文学和艺术现象硬套在这个指示上面，不问列宁给这一术语规定的具体意义是什么，也不问列宁关于党性问题的其他指示怎样讲的。用书呆子习气是不可能了解文学艺术的党性原则的，必须更深刻地研究问题的实质。
    列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”一书中提出了“哲学上一般地是不是有党派……”的问题，并且说道：“不能不看到哲学上的党派斗争，这一斗争归根结底是表现着现代社会中相互敌对的阶级的倾向和观念形态。现代哲学是有党派性的，正像两千年前的哲学一样。纵然被假充博学的新名词或极其愚蠢的非党派性所掩饰着，互相斗争着的党派，实质上是唯物主义和唯心主义”。
    可见，列宁在这里说的哲学中的党派斗争是唯物主义和唯心主义的党派的斗争，同时指出唯心主义从来都是代表反动阶级的倾向和观念形态的。
    如果把上述对党性的理解机械地搬运到文学艺术方面来，就会产生庸俗化的危险。大家都知道，在艺术创作中，作者的政治观点常常是远不像在哲学或其他社会科学当中那样直接地表现出来的。甚至于常有这样的情形，艺术家所创造的作品的客观意义跟他的政治观点和同情是矛盾的。在这一方面，正像恩格斯所指出的，巴尔札克的创作是一个明显的例证。在过去的其他的伟大艺术家的作品当中，也可以看到同样的情况。因此，决不容许简单地把一切艺术家划分为两个在政治上相对立的党派。主张做这样的划分的人们的根据是，从来只有反动的艺术和进步的艺术。毫无疑问，这是一个正确的原理。但是，人们从这个原理当中作出了错误的结论，依据这一结论，进步性和党性混为一谈了。在这一定义当中，党性的具体内容消失了。不仅如此，这一定义还提供了一个论据，认为那些尽管是属于不同阶级的各个时代的进步艺术家，都是同一的党性立场的代表者。那些用教条主义态度对待哲学中有各种党派的这一指示的研究家们，正是达到了这样荒谬的程度，他们把这一指示运用到文学艺术当中大谈其反动党派和进步党派。结果是，在这些研究家看来，格里包耶多夫，车尔尼雪夫斯基和高尔基都是属于一个党派营垒的作家。
    列宁并不是把党性的概念看成抽象的、无所不包的范畴。列宁是根据一定的历史环境揭示党性的具体内容的。列宁认为党性是高度发展的阶级斗争的结果。他教导我们说：党性“……要求在对事变做任何估计时都必须直率而公开地站到一定社会集团的立场上”。列宁写道：“因为没有一个活着的人能够不站到这个或那个阶级方面来（如果他理解到了它们的相互关系），能够不以该阶级的胜利为快乐，以其失败为悲痛，能够不对于敌视这个阶级的人，对于散布落后观点来妨碍其发展的人以及其他等等的人，表示愤怒”。
    可见，这里讲的是自觉的党性的立场，它是以对于各个阶级的相互关系的理解为前提的，是以热烈地拥护人们所从属的阶级的利益为前提的。1905年列宁在他的著名的论文“党的组织和党的文学”当中表达的正是这样的思想，在这篇论文当中第一次表述了文学艺术的党性原则。从对于党性原则的这种理解出发，我们能不能够像认为典型性是党性表现的基本范围的那一公式所要求的那样，把创造了多种多样的典型形象的不同时代的现实主义艺术家，都算在有党性的作家的范畴里呢？显然，是不能的。
    庸俗社会学已经垮台了。现在再没有谁敢于像以前那些最极端的庸俗社会学家所表现的那样，把普希金和果戈理的创作归结为小地主或中等贵族的利益的反映。但是，如果彻底地把历史上的伟大现实主义艺术家都叫做有党性的艺术家，势必把他们都列为劳动者阶级的有坚定信念的、自觉的保卫者和拥护者。可是没有谁敢于作这样的反科学的牵强附会。于是，烦琐哲学的公式就落空了。它使人们不能正确地分析文学历史的具体现象。但是，许多按照出身和教养来说属于占统治地位的剥削阶级的伟大艺术家的创作的人民性，却是和他们突破本阶级的利益的狭隘框子的能力分不开的，却是和他们用对现实的客观的、真实的描写来促进争取解放的趋向的发展（甚至他们并不是公开地站在人民群众的立场上）的能力分不开的。想把这样的艺术家的创作跟真正意义上的党性拉扯在一起，其结果只能是庸俗化。
    或者我们拿资本主义各国中现代的进步的现实主义艺术家的创作做例子。现在，在这些艺术家中间，自觉地、坚信地把自己的创作跟工人阶级、跟共产党的政策联系起来的人，暂时还不很多。由于种种原因，他们还没有接受艺术的党性原则，甚至有一些人还远远避开它。
    如果相信烦琐哲学的公式，这些艺术家是不可能创造出典型的形象的，因为，典型是党性表现的范围。但是，这些艺术家努力忠实地、真实地反映生活，他们正在创造着鲜明的典型形象，并且以自己的创作为进步事业服务。毫无疑问，一旦提高到公开地、坚信地为劳动者利益服务的水平，他们会成为群众的更加积极的、战斗的教育者；但这是将来的事情，这要看各国共产党把进步知识分子吸引到自己这一方面来的本领。
    不同时代、不同阶级的艺术家的世界观问题，是一个极其复杂的问题。对文学艺术现象的具体研究表明，艺术家的世界观往往是非常矛盾的，而这种情况不会不反映在他们的创作当中。列宁对托尔斯泰的创作的分析，就是这一事实的最明显的证明。党性是以世界观的自觉的明确的阶级性为前提的，远不是所有艺术家都有这种明确性。共产主义的党性——社会主义文学的艺术方法的基本的思想原则，是这种世界观的明确性的最高表现。
    论文指出：列宁在“党的组织和党的文学”这篇论文中，提出了党的文学的思想，给它规定了新的历史的内容，这里讲的正是共产主义的党性，认为它是创造真正的人民的艺术的基础。真正的人民的艺术“替千千万万劳动人民服务。这些劳动人民是国家的精华，国家的力量，国家的未来。”
    很明显，决不能把文学艺术中的党性概念的历史的具体的内容，简单化地、烦琐哲学地跟一切时代所有艺术家的典型化联系在一起。
    还应该明确地看到，我们的文学艺术的党性，同资产阶级的党性有原则性的区别。苏联作家和艺术工作者的创作是有党性的，同时又在典型的艺术形象当中反映出客观的生活真实，反映出共产党的政策所依据的我国的现实发展的客观规律性。社会主义现实主义的方法要求艺术创作从事实和生动的现实现象出发，而不是从主观的想像和愿望出发。真正的共产主义的党性是同一切主观主义的表现背道而驰的，是同把人物变成思想的简单的传声筒，强迫人物接受不是他的性格所固有的思想和感情的作法背道而驰的。
    由于共产主义的党性代表着劳动者的最广泛的阶层的利益，因此，它是人民性的最高的表现。
        ×　×　×
    论文还指出：最近一个时期，人们往往根据烦琐哲学的公式，把艺术典型化的某一些方法神圣化起来。有一种意见认为，创造典型形象必须有意识地加以夸张，仿佛在任何场合，有意识的夸张都能够更加充分地发掘和强调典型性。
    许多世纪以来的艺术和文学的历史令人信服地证明：典型化的手段和手法，创造典型形象的方法是多种多样、无穷无尽的。这些方法和手段是随着人类的艺术发展而不断地发展和丰富起来的。典型化方法的多样性是由许许多多因素决定的：艺术家用来进行创作的具体的艺术形式和样式的特点，艺术家的思想任务、创作任务等等。
    艺术原则和创造典型形象的方法，在长篇小说里和抒情作品或讽刺作品里的典型化方法是不同的，戏剧作品也有自己的规律，自己的创造典型性格的方法。描写的对象以及描写的态度本身，艺术家所遵循的创作方法，都在创作实践中给予典型化的方法以决定性的影响。
    不考虑艺术实践和文学艺术发展的一切复杂性，就把某一些典型化方法神圣化起来，并且毫无根据地断定这些方法优于其他许多方法，只能够带来损害。决不能把典型化的艺术方法的一切多样性，都归结为夸张。
    过去的现实主义文学的经验和我们苏联文学的经验表明：只有在解决特殊的、专门的艺术任务时，艺术家才采取夸大了的意义上的夸张方法。在讽刺文学或浪漫主义作品中，例如，在高尔基的早期作品中，常常采用这种方法。可是，如果我们看一看高尔基的现实主义的巨著，我们就可以看到，他是很少采用这种字面意义上的夸张的手法的。但是在理论著作中，高尔基曾经不止一次地谈到他主张夸张。只有以书呆子习气对待伟大作家的言论的人，才会设想高尔基把夸大了的意义上的夸张，当作普遍的、万灵的典型化方法。
    可是，高尔基还在哪一种意义上使用过夸张这一术语呢？他把夸张理解为“对现象的广泛的典型化”，艺术家善于使自己站在现象的上面，看到它们之间的联系，领会它们的意义，找到特殊的东西，并在这些特殊的东西当中表现出普遍的东西，即创造出有极大的概括性和意义的艺术形象。高尔基不止一次地在他的论文和讲话当中谈到过这一点。他说：“一切伟大作品，一切成为高度艺术性的文学的典范的作品，都是建立在夸张上面的，建立在现象的广泛典型化的基础上面的。”
    高尔基之所以提出这样的要求，是为了更深刻、更鲜明地为表现苏联人民而斗争，为了反对文学落后于生活的现象。
    高尔基说过：“我们的正在创造着社会主义文化的现实的、活的英雄人物，比起我们的长篇小说和中篇小说当中的英雄人物来，要崇高得多，伟大得多，在文学中应该把他们描写得更伟大、更鲜明……。”
    在高尔基这些以及其他言论当中，夸张并不是典型化的方法的一种，而是和典型本身的概念一致的。因此，应该指出，高尔基在谈到典型化的时候，从来都对艺术的幻想，对艺术家选择事实和生活现象时的“想像”的才能，给予了极大的注意。这种在现实生活基础上的“想像”，同艺术的现实主义是并不矛盾的。但是，教条主义者抓住了字面意义上的“夸张”，并且企图把它变成一种指示，要求在一切场合，在文学艺术的一切形式和样式中都必须加以遵守。
    无条件地要求夸张已经给我国的艺术和文学带来了不少的损害。有一些创作工作者和批评家把夸张了解为必须夸大现实的现象，这已经引导到离开社会主义现实主义的实质——在现实的革命发展中真实地反映现实。这种夸张已经开始招致对现实主义艺术的基本规律的破坏，而现实主义艺术是要求艺术形象同生活的真实相一致的。
    关于夸张问题的理论上的混乱，在一定程度上助长了一些错误地反映苏联现实的作品的出现，特别是助长了一些粉饰现实的作品的出现。
    事实上，如果从必须有意识地夸张现实中的正面现象的原则出发（因为，据说只有这样，才能够最充分地表现出一定社会力量的本质），那末结果就会忽视实际的现实的，跳过我国建设的困难，甚至跳过它的阶段。这种描写生活的方法不能正确地给读者指出方向，也不能正确地教育他们。
    各式各样的关于典型的特殊人物的可疑的议论的出现，也是和这种错误理论有联系的，根据这种议论，特殊的现象，就是少见的现象。但是，在现实主义艺术中，少见的现象只有当它是反映新事物的萌芽、而且这些萌芽永远使自己具有群众性的潜在力量的时候，才能成为典型的现象。
    少见的现象只有当它跟有规律的现象相联系、而不是和偶然的现象相联系的时候，才能成为典型的现象。把典型的现象跟大量的现象脱离开来，把典型的现象跟大量的现象对立起来，把典型的现象看成是特殊的现象——这就是引导人们创造不是现实的、而是臆造的、装模作样的人物。
    但是，有时候有一些不健康的情绪和这种健康的抗议混杂在一起，个别批评家喊叫什么把表现普通的苏联人的要求降低到拿平庸人物做标准，他们用这种理由来反对创造作为人们的榜样的先进人物的形象。如果走上这条道路，就是极其严重的错误。用自己的艺术语言的武器来支持一切生活领域中的新事物的萌芽，宣传共产主义建设的先进经验，这是作家——思想战线上的战士的天职。
    和烦琐哲学所理解的夸张的公式相关连的极大的危险还在于，它引导人们夸大描写现实中的反面现象，其结果是歪曲了苏联的现实，这一错误的倾向特别尖锐地表现在“新世界”杂志上面发表的许多论文当中，表现在左林的“客人”和维尔塔的“庞别耶夫之死”等剧本当中。苏联的舆论界和报刊坚决地谴责了这些作品。
    正像不相信被说得天花乱坠的好人一样，读者不会相信夸大了的恶棍可以在我国的大地上不受惩罚地摇来摆去，因为，这是对远景的歪曲，是和实际的现实相对立的。

    论文的最后部分写道：正确地和有成效地研究艺术的理论问题，是当前迫切的任务之一。我们拥有马克思列宁主义经典作家的许多指示，伟大作家和批评家的言论，文学艺术的生动的发展的丰富经验。必须消除美学中的烦琐哲学和教条主义。这样做，将会为全面地研究典型性问题以及其他重要的美学问题，开辟广阔的途径。这样做，将会推动我国文学艺术的实践，为取得新的成就，为创造无愧于正在建设共产主义的人民的具有高度艺术水平的新作品，开辟广阔的前途。
