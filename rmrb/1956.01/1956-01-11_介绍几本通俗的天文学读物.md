Introducing Some Popular Astronomy Books
Zheng Wenguang

Marxism-Leninism is the science of the laws of development of nature and society. Engels said, "The laws of dialectics are derived from the history of nature and human society." Therefore, possessing a certain amount of natural science knowledge, including astronomical knowledge, is helpful in mastering Marxism-Leninism and resisting the intrusion of various bourgeois idealist thoughts.

Currently, superstitions about astronomical phenomena are still widespread among the broad masses of people. The existence of these superstitious ideas is, on the one hand, a reflection of cultural backwardness, and on the other hand, it is closely related to the deliberate spread by successive ruling classes. For example, China was able to predict solar and lunar eclipses very early according to the laws of the moon's movement, but successive emperors pretended that the people had committed sins, causing "heavenly wrath" and sending heavenly dogs to chase and eat the sun and moon when solar and lunar eclipses were about to occur. In Europe, until the 17th century, the church—a powerful pillar of feudal rule—forbade the dissemination of the great astronomer Copernicus's theory of the universe and burned the outstanding thinker Bruno for it, and interrogated the outstanding physicist Galileo. The more superstitious and backward the people are, the more they are resigned to fate; thus, the reactionary rule is even more "as solid as a rock." It is no wonder that successive rulers have always colluded with all kinds of superstitious propagandists, casting a net of religious superstition over the heads of the people.

The development of modern astronomy has completely shattered these fallacies of religious superstition. People have gradually discovered that the Earth is not the center of the universe specifically created by gods or God, but merely a small, dark, and cold stone ball orbiting the sun. We can only call the Earth and its eight brothers the planets of the solar system. As for the stars in the sky, they are all gas balls as hot, bright, and huge as the sun, called stars. Hundreds of billions of stars gather to form the vast Milky Way galaxy, and the sun in the Milky Way is only equivalent to a drop of seawater in the Pacific Ocean. The universe is vast and boundless. Hundreds of millions of galaxies have now been discovered, but the end of the universe is far from being reached—the universe has no end.

Science has revealed the face of the distant stellar world. By studying the light from stars, scientists know how high the temperature of stars tens of thousands of trillions of kilometers away is, what elements are on them, what structure the matter on them has, and how they are moving. In the past decade, scientists have further searched for the secrets of the stellar world based on radio waves from outer space.

Science has also explained many seemingly mysterious phenomena in the starry sky. For example, solar and lunar eclipses are just natural phenomena in which the moon and the earth block sunlight. Meteors, which look like "falling stars," have been confirmed as natural phenomena in which small stones in outer space rush into the Earth's atmosphere at high speed and rub, heat up, and turn into vapor. Comets, which people have long thought to be omens of misfortune, have also been known to be piles of small stones; because they are too close to the sun, they are baked by the sun's heat and emit gas; this gas is then pushed back by the pressure of sunlight, forming a "tail" that sweeps across tens of millions of kilometers, which has nothing to do with the fate of Earth's inhabitants.

Science has also gradually clarified the laws of motion, development, and change of the universe. Not only are the Earth and planets rushing around the sun, but the sun is also leading its family to the vicinity of Vega at a high speed of 20 kilometers per second. In addition, our entire Milky Way is also in a great rotation, and the sun's speed in this great rotation reaches 250 kilometers per second. Even the Milky Way is participating in a more complex movement of rotating around the common center of gravity of the surrounding galaxies. The universe is developing and changing in this endless process of movement. It has neither origin nor end. However, all kinds of celestial bodies in the universe are products of individual stages of the development of matter in the universe. At present, scientists have begun to solve the problem of the origin of stars, diffuse nebulae, and planets.

Despite the rapid development of science, idealist thought stubbornly refuses to give up its position. Today, in capitalist countries, some scholars who serve the monopoly bourgeoisie are still spreading fallacies such as "cosmic agnosticism," "cosmic finiteness," and "the end of the world." In old China, idealist astronomical theories were also widely disseminated. For example, almost all intellectuals of our generation accepted the Earth's origin hypothesis of the British idealist astronomer Jeans. According to this hypothesis, the Earth was formed by the condensation of tidal matter sucked up from the sun's surface when a star approached the sun. However, judging from the distribution of stars in space, it is almost impossible for two stars to get close enough to suck up tides. Therefore, what other explanation can there be for this legendary origin of the Earth other than attributing it to God's special "favor"?

Here are some relatively excellent popular astronomy books. These readings explain the basic issues mentioned above.

"Struggle for a Materialist Worldview in Astronomy" (authored by Aristov, published by China Youth Publishing House), "The Structure of the Universe" (authored by Vorontsov-Velyaminov, published by China Youth Publishing House), and "How Mankind Came to Know the Universe" (authored by Fesenkov, published by the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization) clarify the connection between astronomy and philosophy, the struggle between materialism and idealism in astronomy, what things are in the universe, their relationships with each other, their movements and changes, and the history of mankind's understanding of the objective universe and its laws of motion, and so on. Readers with a junior high school education can read these three books.

If you want to know more about astronomy, you can read "The Sun" (authored by Aristov, published by China Youth Publishing House), "The Earth and the Planets" (authored by Baev et al., published by China Youth Publishing House), "Astronomical Knowledge" (authored by Dai Wensai, published by the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization), "How Many Stars Are There in the Sky" (authored by Ogotnikov, published by the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization), and "The Stellar World" (authored by He Tianjian, published by the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization). These five books introduce in more detail the knowledge about the sun, the Earth and planets, and the stellar world. Reading these five books together can roughly obtain an outline of the universe.

"The Story of the Sun" (authored by Zhu He, published by Popular Reading Press) and "Solar and Lunar Eclipses" (authored by Bian Depei, published by Children's Publishing House) are suitable for readers with lower cultural levels (such as higher primary school). They are written in a more popular style, but the descriptions of certain scientific concepts are not strict enough.

"Entertaining Astronomy" (authored by Perelman, published by China Youth Publishing House), just as its name suggests, extracts some interesting problems in astronomy for elaboration. It is of great significance not only for ordinary readers but also for scientific workers. However, reading this book requires a certain amount of mathematical knowledge. At the same time, because it discusses the topics one by one and lacks a rigorous system, readers should read the previous books first before reading it.

Currently, there are very few popular astronomy books published in China, and most of them are translated from the Soviet Union. This is far from meeting the needs of the vast number of readers. Therefore, it is hoped that China's scientific and publishing circles will write and publish more astronomical readings with rich scientific content, a high level of ideological thought, and that can be linked to China's reality and are popular and vivid.

    介绍几本通俗的天文学读物
    郑文光
    马克思列宁主义是关于自然和社会的发展规律的科学。恩格斯说：“辩证法的规律是从自然界和人类社会的历史中抽引出来的。”因此，具备一定的自然科学知识，包括天文知识在内，就有助于掌握马克思列宁主义，抗击形形色色资产阶级唯心主义思想的侵袭。
    目前，在广大人民群众中，关于天文现象的迷信，流传还很广泛。这些迷信思想的存在，一方面是文化落后的反映，另一方面又跟历代统治阶级有意传播紧密联系。例如，我国很早就能根据月亮运行的规律预报日月食，可是历代帝王都在日月食行将发生的时候，假惺惺地说什么人民犯了罪愆，以致“上天震怒”，将派天狗追吃太阳和月亮。在欧洲，直到17世纪，教会——封建统治的强大支柱——还禁止伟大的天文学家哥白尼关于宇宙构造理论的传播，并且为此烧死了卓越的思想家布鲁诺，审讯过杰出的物理学家伽利略。人民越是迷信落后，就越是听天由命；于是，反动统治也就越是“安如磐石”。这就无怪乎历代统治者总是跟形形色色的迷信宣传家相互勾结，在人民头上撒下宗教迷信的天罗地网。
    近代天文学的发展，彻底地粉碎了这种宗教迷信的谬说。人们逐渐发现，地球并不是神仙或上帝所特意创造出来的宇宙的中心，而仅仅是环绕太阳运行的一颗细小、暗黑、寒冷的石头球而已，我们只能把地球和它的八个兄弟叫作太阳系的行星。至于满天的星斗，都是跟太阳一样灼热、一样光亮、一样庞大的叫作恒星的气体球。数以千亿计的恒星集结为庞大的银河系，太阳在银河系内只不过相当于太平洋中的一滴海水。宇宙是辽阔无边的，现在已发现了上亿个银河系，然而远远没有达到宇宙的尽头，——宇宙是没有尽头的。
    科学揭示了遥远的恒星世界的面貌。研究恒星射来的光，科学家知道了远在数万万万万公里外的恒星的温度有多高，它上面有些什么元素，它上面的物质有着怎样的结构，它又在怎样地运动着。最近十年来，科学家又根据宇宙空间射来的无线电波，进一步地搜索恒星世界的秘密。
    科学又解释了许多仿佛是神秘的星空的现象。例如，日食和月食只不过是月亮和地球拦住了太阳光线的自然现象。看去好像“星星陨落了”的流星，已经证实是宇宙空间的小石头高速冲入地球大气层而摩擦、灼热、化为蒸气的自然现象。长期以来人们以为预兆什么不幸的彗星，也已被人知道乃是一堆小石头；由于它们太靠近太阳了，它们就被太阳热力烤得冒出气体；这层气体又被太阳光的压力压向后面，形成一道横扫数千万公里的“尾巴”，它跟地球居民的命运是毫无关联的。
    科学也逐步阐明了宇宙的运动、发展和变化的规律。不但地球和行星们正在绕太阳飞奔，而且太阳也正率领着它的家族以每秒20公里的高速度奔向织女星附近。此外，我们整个银河系也在大旋转中，太阳在这大旋转中运动的速度达到每秒250公里。就连银河系也参与着更加复杂的、环绕周围各个星系共同重心旋转的运动。宇宙就在这无穷无尽的运动过程中发展着、变化着。它既没有起源，也没有末日。然而，宇宙中的各种天体，都是宇宙中物质发展的个别阶段的产物。目前，科学家已经开始着手解决恒星、弥漫星云和行星的起源这个问题了。
    尽管科学在突飞猛进地发展，唯心主义思想仍然顽固地不愿让出阵地。现今，在资本主义国家内，为垄断资产阶级服务的若干学者，还在散布“宇宙不可知论”、“宇宙有限论”、“世界末日”等等谬说。在旧中国，唯心主义天文学说也曾得到广泛的传播。例如，几乎我们这一代所有的知识分子，都接受过英国唯心主义天文学家秦斯的地球起源假说。按照这个假说，地球是由某一颗恒星靠近太阳时在太阳面上吸起的潮汐物质冷凝而成的。然而，从恒星在空间的分布看，要使两颗恒星靠近到能吸起潮汐，那几乎是不可能的。因此，地球的这一传奇性的起源，除了归功于上帝的特别“垂青”以外，还能有什么解释呢？
    这里，介绍几本比较优秀的天文学通俗读物。这些读物所阐述的就是上面所提的那些基本问题。
    “为天文学中的唯物主义世界观而斗争”（亚里斯托夫著，中国青年出版社出版）、“宇宙的构造”（伏龙卓夫—维略明诺夫著，中国青年出版社出版）和“人类怎样认识了宇宙”（符谢赫斯维亚茨基著，中华全国科学技术普及协会出版）这三本书，分别阐明了天文学跟哲学的关联，天文学中唯物主义跟唯心主义的斗争，宇宙中有些什么事物，它们相互之间的关系，它们的运动和变化，人类认识客观宇宙及其运动规律的历史，等等。这三本书，只要具有初中文化程度的读者就可阅读。
    如果还想多晓得一些天文学知识，可以阅读“太阳”（亚里斯托夫著，中国青年出版社出版）、“地球和行星”（巴叶夫等著，中国青年出版社出版）、“天文知识”（戴文赛著，中华全国科学技术普及协会出版）、“天上有多少星”（奥高洛特尼可夫著，中华全国科学技术普及协会出版）和“恒星世界”（贺天健著，中华全国科学技术普及协会出版）。这五本书更详细地介绍了关于太阳、地球和行星、恒星世界的知识。这五本书合起来读，大致可以获得一个关于宇宙的轮廓。
    “太阳的故事”（祝贺著，通俗读物出版社出版）和“日食和月食”（卞德培著，少年儿童出版社出版）这两本书，适合于文化水平更低（例如高小）的读者。它们写得比较通俗，然而对于某些科学概念叙述不够严格。
    “趣味天文学”（别莱利曼著，中国青年出版社出版）这本书，正如同它的名字所指的，是撷取了天文学上一些饶有趣味的问题加以阐述的。它不仅对于普通读者，就是对于科学工作者也很有意义。但是，阅读这本书需要一定的数学知识。同时，由于它是逐题来谈，缺乏严谨的体系，所以读者最好先读前面各书以后再来读它。
    目前国内已经出版的通俗天文学读物很少，其中大多数又是从苏联翻译过来的。这就远远不能满足广大读者的需要。因此，希望我国的科学界和出版界撰写和出版更多具有丰富科学内容、高度思想水平，并能联系中国实际而又通俗生动的天文学读物来。
