    Improving the Design of Double-Wheel Two-Share Plows
    To the Editors:
    Since the double-wheel two-share plow has had a unified standard, its specifications and quality have been basically suitable for farmers' use. However, we feel that the current standards still have shortcomings, mainly that they only pay attention to durability, while not considering economic effects sufficiently. Therefore, the manufacture of double-wheel two-share plows uses a lot of steel and takes a lot of man-hours, which increases the production cost of agricultural implements.
    Before the unified standards were established in 1954, our factory used malleable iron and nodular cast iron for some parts of the double-wheel two-share plow, and the quality was guaranteed. However, these parts were later changed to steel, which increased the cost of each plow by 6.58 yuan. (This year, these parts have been changed back to malleable iron.) The current plowshare stipulates that steel must be used, and the design only considers thickening the middle rib of the plowshare so that farmers can hammer and extend it. Therefore, the plowshare material is asymmetrical, and each plowshare loses a triangular piece of steel weighing 0.3 kg. Due to the design's sole consideration of using good steel, without understanding the domestic steel production and supply situation at the time, it also caused many losses. For example, the double-wheel two-share plow specified in 1954 used a large amount of No. 5 steel, but in early 1955, China could not produce this steel in large quantities, so substitutes had to be found temporarily. As a result, our factory transferred in 216 tons of steel rail billets, which later could not be used, resulting in a backlog.
    In order to improve new agricultural implements, we suggest that the relevant leading authorities should not only consider the standard specifications of agricultural implements more carefully, but also hope that before the new standard drawings are officially put into production, a small batch of trial production should be carried out, so as to conduct a strict review and revision of the drawings again. In addition, it is also necessary to further formulate national material consumption quotas through the introduction and promotion of advanced material consumption quotas.

### 改进双轮双铧犁的设计工作

    改进双轮双铧犁的设计工作编辑同志：
    双轮双铧犁的规格和质量，自从有了统一的标准以后，基本上已能够适合农民的使用。但是，我们觉得目前的标准还有缺点，主要是只注意到坚固耐用的一面，而对经济效果却考虑得不够。因此，制造双轮双铧犁的时候，钢材用得多，工时花得多，这就增加了农具的生产成本。
    在1954年订出统一的标准以前，我们厂有几种双轮双铧犁的零件使用麻钢和球墨铸铁，质量已有保证；但是，以后这些零件都改用钢材，使每部犁的成本上升了6.58元。（今年这些零件又改用麻钢了。）现在的犁铧规定要用钢材，设计的时候只考虑到把犁铧的中间筋加厚，以便农民可以拍打展延，因此，铧片材料不对称，每片犁铧要损失一块三角形的重0.3公斤的钢材。由于设计方面单纯考虑使用好钢材，没有摸清当时国内钢材生产和供应的情况，也造成了许多损失。例如，1954年规定的双轮双铧犁，大量使用大五号钢材，但是1955年初，我国还不能大量生产这种钢材，不得不临时找用代用品。结果我们厂即调进了216吨钢轨轧坯，后来这些钢轨轧坯又不能用，造成积压。
    为了改进新农具，我们建议有关的领导机关除了应该更加慎重地考虑农具的标准规格以外，并且希望在新标准的图纸正式投入生产以前，要经过小批试制，以便对图纸再进行一次严格的审查和修正。此外，还应该通过介绍、推广先进的材料消耗定额，进一步制定全国的材料消耗定额。
