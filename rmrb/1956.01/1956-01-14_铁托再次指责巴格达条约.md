Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, January 13th: The President of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, Tito, returned to Belgrade on the afternoon of January 12th after visiting Ethiopia and Egypt. President Tito was welcomed by approximately 300,000 residents of the capital and nearby areas in the square in front of the station.

　　President Tito delivered a speech to the welcoming crowd from the platform in front of the station. Recalling his talks with the leaders of Ethiopia and Egypt, Tito said that they had reached complete understanding and agreement on all issues. Tito said that these visits, as well as last year's visits to India and Burma, prove that there are now conditions in the world for adopting a new path—a new path of mutual understanding, resolving mutual problems peacefully, even problems of an international nature, without speaking from a position of strength, without flexing muscles, and without an arms race.

　　Tito then mentioned some opinions from abroad, which generally stated that he was attacking the Baghdad Pact for the first time, which would certainly be a blow to those allied nations that have some kind of agreement with Yugoslavia. Tito said that he has criticized this treaty many times, even in front of the leaders of major powers, because he believes that this treaty only causes anxiety among the people of all countries and is a factor that creates disunity among the countries of the Middle East and the Arab people. This treaty brings new factors of unease and creates new hotbeds for possible conflicts.

    铁托再次指责巴格达条约
    据新华社13日讯  据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国总统铁托在访问了埃塞俄比亚和埃及之后，在1月12日下午回到贝尔格莱德。铁托总统在车站前的广场上受到首都和附近地方30万左右居民的欢迎。
    铁托在车站前的讲台上对欢迎群众发表了演说。铁托在回忆同埃塞俄比亚和埃及领袖的会谈时说，他们在各项问题上都取得了完全的谅解和一致的意见。铁托说，这些访问以及去年到印度和缅甸的访问都证明，现在世界上存在着采取一种新途径的条件——这种新途径就是互相谅解，用和平办法解决相互间的问题，甚至是国际性质的问题，而不需要从实力地位讲话，不需要摩拳擦掌和军备竞赛。
    铁托接着提到国外的一些意见，这些意见大意是说，他现在第一次攻击了巴格达条约，这肯定是对于那些和南斯拉夫缔结有某种协定的盟国的一个打击。铁托说，我已经指责过这个条约许多次了，甚至在大国的领袖的面前指责它，因为我认为这个条约只是使各国人民焦虑不安的东西，是一个造成中东国家和阿拉伯人民的不团结的因素。这个条约带有不安的新因素，并且为可能发生的冲突创造了新的温床。
