Xinhua News Agency, London, 8th. On December 30, 1955, Huan Xiang, Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in the United Kingdom, discussed the development of relations between China and Italy with Vittorio Zoppi, the Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Chargé d'Affaires Huan Xiang first stated to Ambassador Zoppi: During the contact between Chinese and Italian representatives in Geneva on October 22, 1955, the Chinese government suggested that while government representatives of the two countries negotiate on trade issues, they should also negotiate on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, in order to meet the wishes of the people of both countries and fully develop bilateral trade. The Italian government representative did not agree to this proposal at that time. Chargé d'Affaires Huan Xiang expressed regret that the Italian government had not accepted this proposal, and reiterated the Chinese government's above-mentioned proposal, hoping that the Italian government would consider it. However, Ambassador Zoppi still did not agree to the Chinese side's proposal.
    The Chinese government has always been willing to develop trade with all countries based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. During this meeting, Representative Huan Xiang stated that the Chinese government agreed to first hold talks with the Italian government in London on the issue of expanding trade between the two countries.

　　中意两国代表商谈两国关系问题
    新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：1955年12月30日，中国驻英代办宦乡同意大利驻英大使维多里奥·佐皮商谈了发展中意两国关系的问题。宦乡代办向佐皮大使首先表明：1955年10月22日中意两国代表在日内瓦进行的接触中，中国政府曾经建议，在中意两国政府代表谈判两国贸易问题的同时，应该就建立两国外交关系的问题进行谈判，以符合两国人民的愿望和充分发展两国贸易的需要。当时意大利政府代表没有同意这项建议。宦乡代办对意大利政府未能接受此项建议表示遗憾，并且重申了中国政府的上述建议，希望意大利政府考虑。但是，佐皮大使仍然没有同意中国方面的建议。
    中国政府一向愿意根据平等互利的原则同各国发展贸易，在此次会谈中，宦乡代表表示，中国政府同意先同意大利政府在伦敦就两国间扩大贸易的问题进行商谈。
