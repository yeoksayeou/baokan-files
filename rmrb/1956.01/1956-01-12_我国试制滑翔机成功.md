    Our Country Successfully Trial-Produces Gliders
    The newly built factory of the gliding school of the Central National Defense Sports Club has recently successfully trial-produced two new primary trainer gliders. These two gliders can be used for catapult take-off, winch-vehicle towing take-off, aircraft towing take-off, training flights, and dive aerobatic flights. After five test flights at different altitudes, it has been proven that the new glider's control system is very flexible and its stability is also very good.

    我国试制滑翔机成功
    中央国防体育俱乐部滑翔学校新建的工厂，最近试制成功两架新型的初级教练滑翔机。这两架滑翔机可以作弹射起飞、绞盘车牵引起飞、飞机牵引起飞，训练飞行和俯冲特技飞行。经过五次不同高度的试验飞行，证明新滑翔机操纵系统非常灵活，安定性也很好。
