Where is Advanced Experience?
Wang Pu

Last year, the Northeast Sixth Pharmaceutical Factory proposed the goal of "improving the recovery rate of sulfa powder" to its employees during the increase production and practice economy movement. The leaders of the trade union believed that to achieve this goal, it was necessary to conscientiously promote advanced experience. However, where was the advanced experience to be found? They couldn't figure it out for a long time.

Once, they were reviewing the economic activity analysis reports and found that the recovery rate of sulfa powder had increased. Upon inquiring in the workshop, they learned that workers Miao Jiatian and others had improved the technological process. Soon, they discovered from the production reports that the eight economic indicators of the condensation section were not completed. So they went deep into this section to check the original records and found that the output and content of Yuan Wenkui's team were higher than those of other teams; they also found that Li Shoushan's team had better methods for controlling the degree of vacuum than other teams. The trade union summarized and promoted their experiences. The following month, the eight indicators of this section were all overfulfilled. In the second half of last year, they used methods such as analyzing economic activity reports to discover 11 kinds of advanced experience.

The experience of the Northeast Sixth Pharmaceutical Factory tells us that the richest source of advanced experience is among the masses. No matter which enterprise it is, the production levels of each team, group, and individual doing the same work are always inconsistent; no matter which industrial sector it is, the production levels of each enterprise with the same equipment are also different. Advanced experience is hidden within these differences. Although this advanced experience is fragmented and small, its quantity is the largest, its distribution is the widest, and it is the most mass-based. It is the foundation for the generation of significant and complete advanced experience. If each unit can conscientiously explore and promote this advanced experience, then we will have the broadest and most regular force to promote production and construction development.

The experience of the Northeast Sixth Pharmaceutical Factory proves that a good method for discovering this advanced experience is to conduct economic activity analysis, that is, to conduct "comparisons." Compare this factory with that factory, compare this team with that team, compare this month with that month... This kind of comparison will reveal differences; following up closely will lead to the discovery of advanced experience. Enterprises have various original records and various statistical reports. Fully utilizing these materials for analysis and comparison can continuously uncover new advanced experiences.

In the high tide of the comprehensive development of the national economy, all work should not be done slowly and cautiously. We should universally promote the method of economic activity analysis and carry out the work of discovering advanced experience on a large scale.

    先进经验在哪里
    王朴
    东北第六制药厂去年在增产节约运动中，向职工提出了“提高消炎粉回收率”的努力目标。工会的领导人员认为，要达到这个目标，必须认真地推广先进经验。但是，先进经验在哪里呢？他们很久也没有解决。
    有一次，他们翻阅经济活动分析表报，发现消炎粉回收率提高了。到车间去了解，原来是工人苗佳田等改进了工艺过程。不久，他们又从生产表报上发现缩合工段八项经济指标全没完成。于是他们就深入这个工段查看原始记录，发现苑文奎班的产量、含量都比其他班高；又发现李寿山班控制真空度比别的班有办法。工会总结、推广了他们的经验。第二个月，这个工段的八项指标都超额完成了。去年下半年，他们就用分析经济活动表报等方法，发现了11种先进经验。
    东北第六制药厂的经验告诉我们：产生先进经验的最丰富的源泉是在群众中间。不论在哪个企业里，做同样工作的各个班、组、个人，生产水平总是不一致的；不论在哪个产业部门中，有同样设备的各个企业的生产水平也是不一样的。在这些差别中间就蕴藏着先进经验。这种先进经验虽然零碎、细小；但是它的数量最多，分布最广，最富于群众性，它是重大的、完整的先进经验产生的基础。如果每个单位都能认真地发掘和推广这种先进经验，那么，我们就会拥有一支最广泛、最经常的推动生产和建设发展的力量。
    东北第六制药厂的经验证明：发现这种先进经验的一个好方法，就是进行经济活动分析，就是进行“比较”。这个厂和那个厂比较，这个班和那个班比较，这个月和那个月比较……这样一比，就出现了差别；跟踪追击，就会发现先进经验。企业里有各种原始记录、各种统计表报，充分利用这些资料进行分析比较，就可以不断发掘出新的先进经验来。
    在国民经济全面发展的高潮中，一切工作都不能缩手缩脚地慢吞吞地前进。我们应该普遍推行经济活动分析的方法，把发掘先进经验的工作也大规模地开展起来。
