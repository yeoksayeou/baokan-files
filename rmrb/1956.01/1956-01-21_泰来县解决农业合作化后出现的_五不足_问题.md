Xinhua News Agency Report

Tailai County, Heilongjiang Province, has achieved agricultural cooperativization. With the improvement of labor efficiency and the development of production, most agricultural production cooperatives have experienced the phenomenon of "five insufficiencies": land, horses, improved seeds, fertilizer, and new-style farm tools. The county's leading organs are working to solve this problem.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient land, the Tailai County Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized members of agricultural production cooperatives throughout the county to reclaim more than 5,000 hectares of land last autumn. Recently, it has organized 99 land reclamation teams, preparing to reclaim more than 24,000 hectares of wasteland after the spring thaw. The expansion of reclaimed land has directly led to a shortage of horses. In addition to using various methods to continue supplying agricultural production cooperatives with draft horses, the county's leading organs are calling on agricultural production cooperatives to improve the feeding and management of livestock and to use draft animals rationally. At the same time, the County People's Committee has also carefully selected a batch of high-quality stallions throughout the county and established two artificial insemination stations to breed horses in a planned manner.

In order to meet the needs of agricultural production cooperatives for improved varieties, fertilizers, and new-style farm tools, the County People's Committee has recently selected a large number of high-quality rice seeds through grain purchasing stations, and has also organized a large number of urban fertilizers to be sent to the countryside. In addition, the County People's Committee has also signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to promote 110 sets of new-style farm tools before spring plowing.

    泰来县解决农业合作化后出现的“五不足”问题
    黑龙江省泰来县实现了农业合作化以后，随着劳动效率的提高和生产的发展，多数农业生产合作社出现了土地、马匹、优良种籽、肥料和新式农具“五不足”的现象。县领导机关正在着手解决这一问题。
    为了解决土地不足的问题，中共泰来县委在去年秋季就发动全县农业生产合作社社员开垦了5，000多公顷土地，最近又组成99个开荒队，准备在春季化冻以后再开垦荒地24，000多公顷。扩大开荒面积直接带来了马匹不足的困难。县领导机关除运用各种办法继续供应农业生产合作社耕马以外，还号召农业生产合作社改善牲畜的饲养管理，合理地使用耕畜。同时，县人民委员会又在全县精选出一批优良种马，设立2处人工配马站，以便有计划地繁殖马匹。
    为了满足农业生产合作社对优良品种、肥料和新式农具的需要，县人民委员会最近已经通过粮食收购站挑选出大批优良稻种，又组织大批城粪下乡。另外，县人民委员会还和供销合作社订立了合同，准备在春耕前再推广110套新式农具。（据新华社讯）
