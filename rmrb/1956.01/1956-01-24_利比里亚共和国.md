The Republic of Liberia

Liberia is a country in West Africa. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and by British Sierra Leone, French Guinea, and French Ivory Coast on the other three sides. It has an area of 111,400 square kilometers and a population of approximately 1.6 million.

The Republic of Liberia was established in the following way: In 1816, the U.S. Congress authorized the American Colonization Society to relocate a portion of black people freed by individual slave owners to West Africa. The purpose of the American ruling class in doing so at the time was, on the one hand, to drive some unruly black people out of the Americas, and on the other hand, to establish a base for expansion in Africa. In 1822, the American Colonization Society bought a piece of land from a tribal chief near the Gulf of Guinea on the West African coast, and over the next 40 years, relocated 19,000 black people there. Later, this settlement gradually expanded. In 1838, the American Colonization Society named it the Liberian Commonwealth. By 1847, Liberia declared itself an independent republic. However, the United States did not officially recognize it until 1862.

Liberia is not a large country, but it has considerable resources, the most important of which are iron ore and rubber. According to completed surveys, the reserves of iron ore with a pure iron content of 42% to 68% are nearly 250 million tons. Therefore, Liberia has long been the target of plunder by American monopoly capital. The "Firestone Tire and Rubber Company" of the United States, the Cleveland syndicate, the "Liberia Mining Company" jointly organized by the U.S. Export-Import Bank and Republic Steel Corporation, and the "Stettinius Liberia Corporation" organized by other American monopoly groups, have successively used loans and other means to seize the privilege of developing Liberia's various economic resources and monopolizing other economic undertakings. For example, the "Liberia Mining Company" occupies 67.51% of Liberia's iron ore deposits, and the "Firestone Tire and Rubber Company" occupies 400,000 hectares of rubber plantations, monopolizing Liberia's rubber production.

Under the wanton plunder of American monopoly capital, the Liberian people are naturally extremely poor and backward. A rubber worker's daily wage is only a few cents. Illiteracy accounts for 90% of the total population. In recent years, as the United States has intensified the construction of military bases in Liberia, the local economy has been further damaged, and at the same time, millions of people have been forced to engage in unpaid labor, further exacerbating the plight of the people. Under these circumstances, the Liberian people's opposition to colonialism and demand for peaceful cooperation are growing stronger, and therefore cannot but have a significant impact on national policy. Last year, the Liberian government sent a delegation to the Asian-African Conference in Bandung, and expressed the Liberian people's support for peace and freedom and their opposition to war and enslavement. Recently, Liberia also established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

### 利比里亚共和国

    利比里亚共和国
    利比里亚是非洲西部的一个国家。它西濒大西洋，其他三面同英属塞那勒窝内、法属几内亚和法属象牙海岸相邻接。面积111，400平方公里，人口约160多万。
    利比里亚共和国是这样建立起来的：1816年美国国会授权美国殖民协会，把一部分被个别奴隶主释放的黑人移殖到非洲西部去。当时美国统治阶级这样做的目的，一方面是要把一些难以驯服的黑人赶出美洲大陆，同时也打算在非洲建立一个扩张的据点。1822年，美国殖民协会就在西非海岸几内亚湾附近向一个部落酋长买了一片土地，从那以后的40年中把19，000名黑人移殖到那里去。后来这一块移民地逐渐扩大起来。1838年美国殖民协会把它命名为利比里亚联邦。到1847年，利比里亚宣布为独立的共和国。但是美国到1862年才正式予以承认。
    利比里亚国土不大，却有着相当丰富的资源，其中最主要的是铁矿和橡胶。根据已进行的调查，含纯铁42％到68％的铁矿蕴藏量将近25，000多万吨。因此利比里亚长久以来就成为美国垄断资本掠夺的对象。美国的“费尔斯通轮胎橡胶公司”、克利夫兰财团、美国进出口银行和共和钢铁公司共同组织的“利比里亚矿业公司”以及其他美国垄断集团组织的“斯退汀纽斯·利比里亚合作公司”等，先后利用贷款等手段夺取了开发利比里亚各种经济资源和垄断其他经济事业的特权。像“利比里亚矿业公司”就占有了利比里亚铁矿矿藏67.51％，“费尔斯通轮胎橡胶公司”霸占着40万公顷橡胶园，垄断了利比里亚的橡胶生产。
    在美国垄断资本肆意掠夺下，利比里亚人民自然极端贫困和落后。一个橡胶工人每天的工资只有一角几分钱。文盲占了全部人口90％。近年来，由于美国在利比里亚加紧修筑军事基地，地方经济受到更大的破坏，同时千百万人被迫从事无报酬的劳动，人民的困苦处境更为加深。在这种情况下，利比里亚人民反对殖民主义和要求和平合作的情绪日益强烈，因而也不能不对国家政策发生显著的影响。去年利比里亚政府曾经派遣代表团参加了在万隆举行的亚非会议，并且表达了利比里亚人民拥护和平和自由以及反对战争与奴役的意志。最近，利比里亚又同苏联建立外交关系。
