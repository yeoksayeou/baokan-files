    Large Areas of Land are Being Wasted
    To the Editor:
    In October 1955, the Datong City Urban Planning Committee inspected the land use of 13 basic construction units in the city and found that many units were wasting land. For example, Datong City No. 3 Middle School requested approximately 20 mu of land in the spring of 1955 to build a playground. After the request was approved, the land was not used for the entire year. After a state-owned factory selected its site, it requisitioned 1,400 mu of land, of which more than 600 mu were left barren. This year, the construction area of the Yanbei Salt Company only accounts for 8% of the total land occupied. The construction area (including temporary buildings) of the Yanbei Transportation Branch only accounts for 7% of the total land occupied.
    This phenomenon not only wastes useful land but also creates a negative impact among the masses. Some farmers are dissatisfied and say: We support the state's requisition of land for construction, but it should not be left idle and overgrown with weeds.

### 荒芜了一大片土地

    荒芜了一大片土地编辑同志：
    大同市城市规划委员会在1955年10月份检查了市内13个基本建设单位使用土地的情况，发现很多单位有荒废土地的现象。例如，大同市第三中学在1955年春天要求领用土地约20亩修建操场，批准以后，土地却整年没有被利用。国营某厂在厂址选定以后，前后征用了土地1，400亩，荒芜的就有600多亩。雁北盐业公司今年建筑面积仅占领用土地总面积的8％。雁北运输分局的建筑面积（包括临时建筑在内）只占领用土地总面积的7％。
    这种现象，不但浪费了有用的土地，而且在群众中造成了不良影响。有的农民就不满意地说：国家征购土地进行建筑，我们是拥护的，可是不应该叫土地闲着长草。
