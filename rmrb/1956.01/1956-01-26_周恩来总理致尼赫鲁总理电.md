Premier Zhou Enlai's Telegram to His Excellency Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of the Republic of India:

    On the occasion of the 6th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of India, I extend my warm congratulations to the Government of the Republic of India and to you, and express my respect for the significant contributions you and the Indian people have made to the cause of peace in the past year.

    The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, jointly initiated by China and India, have been recognized by an increasing number of countries in the world, and the friendly relations and close cooperation between our two countries have also been continuously developing on this solid foundation. The Republic of India, as one of the world's major powers, plays an increasingly significant role in international affairs. I sincerely hope that the economic and cultural ties between China and India will continue to be strengthened, and that we will continue to work closely together in alleviating international tensions and promoting the cause of peace in Asia and the world, and jointly strive for greater achievements.

        Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China
             January 24, 1956, Beijing
