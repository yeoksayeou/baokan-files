　　Soviet People's New Year Wishes
    As the first moment of the first day of 1956 arrived, leading comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, representatives of the Supreme Soviet, Party, government, and military workers, cultural workers, and outstanding representatives of laborers, as well as envoys from various countries stationed in Moscow, greeted the New Year at the Kremlin at the invitation of Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. Comrade Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, delivered a New Year's greeting. This greeting was broadcast to every household in the Soviet Union that was welcoming the New Year at that time. Thus, the Soviet people began the first day of the New Year.

    On the first day of the New Year, the Soviet people widely expressed their wishes through newspapers and periodicals.

    The Soviet people universally praised the achievements of Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev's visits to India, Burma, and Afghanistan. At the same time, the Soviet people particularly wished for the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, said: "I wish that 1956 will be a year of even greater upsurge in the struggle to safeguard peace, a struggle that will bring agreements on universal disarmament and the unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the restoration of the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, the victory of world peace, and the daily strengthening of cultural and friendly ties between all countries..." Writer V. Kozhevnikov said: "I hope to read in the newspapers in 1956 the speech of the representative of the People's Republic of China at the United Nations General Assembly. People's China will finally occupy its legitimate seat in the United Nations, which is necessary for world security. My wish is not novel. The vast majority of people in the world share this sentiment. They firmly believe that the mission of the United Nations is not to divide, but to unite, the lofty will of all countries for peace and security." Kozhedub, who received the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union" three times, said: "In the near future, Soviet pilots will greet the New Year in Beijing with their friends, and then, exceeding time and speed of sound, fly back to Moscow to raise a glass at the banquet to celebrate the New Year." Speaking of the Soviet leaders' friendly visits to India, Burma, and Afghanistan, he said: "Our planes can easily fly to any place on earth at their current speed, but we hope that our visits abroad will only be friendly visits."

    1956 is the first year of the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan. As they welcome this unprecedented new step in communist construction, the Soviet people's excitement is overflowing.

    Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said: "In terms of the speed and scale of training specialists, the Soviet Union has taken the first place, which has caused serious alarm in the United States and Britain. In the latest technology, such as the atomic industry, according to the facts and results of the Geneva International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, the world scientific community believes that the Soviet Union has reached the most advanced level." He said that the Soviet Union has the most superior conditions for the development of science, and "the new five-year plan should be a turning point in the speed of applying scientific achievements to technology and to life."

    Not complacent with last year's great achievements, Soviet industrial and agricultural workers have all put forward guarantees for further production increases in the new year. The state stipulates that the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works should increase pig iron production by 2.5%, steel by 6.7%, and steel products by 7% in 1956. The workers believe that this is the minimum increase and are determined to tap potential and increase production even more. On New Year's Day, the workers of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works set a good example. All blast furnaces overfulfilled their tasks. One shift at Blast Furnace No. 7 overproduced 270 tons of pig iron.

    Apart from enterprises such as iron and steel factories that work around the clock in three shifts, Soviet people spent the first day of the New Year in rest. New Year's Day fell on a Sunday, and in the Soviet Union, there is no compensatory holiday. The next day, people threw themselves into new labor with full and unrelenting spirit.

### 苏联人的新年愿望

　　苏联人的新年愿望
    当1956年第一天第一个时刻到来的时候，苏联共产党中央领导同志和最高苏维埃代表、党政军工作者、文化工作者、劳动者的优秀代表，以及各国驻莫斯科的使节，应苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的邀请，在克里姆林宫迎接了新年。苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志发表了新年祝词。这个祝词当时就广播到全苏联正在迎接新年的家家户户。这样，苏联人开始了新年第一天。
    在新年第一天，苏联人通过报刊广泛地表示了自己的愿望。
    苏联人民普遍地赞扬布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫同志访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的成就。同时，苏联人民特别愿望恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。苏联拥护和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫说：“我愿望1956年将是维护和平的斗争更加高涨的一年，这个斗争将带来普遍裁军和无条件禁止原子武器和氢武器问题的协议，中华人民共和国在联合国中的权利的恢复，世界和平的胜利，各国人民的文化和友谊联系的一天天地加强……。”作家瓦·科热夫尼科夫说：“我希望在1956年在报纸上读到中华人民共和国代表在联合国大会上的发言，在联合国中人民中国终将占有为世界安全所必需的自己的合法的席位。我的这个愿望不是新奇的。世界上绝大多数都人同此心，他们深信联合国的使命不是把各国对和平和安全的崇高意志分裂而是团结起来。”得到三次“苏联英雄”称号的阔热杜布说：“在不久的将来，苏联飞行员将在北京自己的朋友那里迎接新年，然后超过时间和音速，飞回莫斯科在宴会上举杯祝贺新年。”在谈到苏联领袖这次对印度、缅甸和阿富汗的友好访问以后，他说：“我们的飞机在现今的速度下能够容易地飞到地球的任何地点，可是我们希望，我们出国的访问将只是友好的访问。” 
    1956年是苏联第六个五年计划开始的第一年。在迎接这个空前巨大的共产主义建设新步骤的时候，苏联人的兴奋情绪洋溢在语言的外表。
    苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫说：“就培养专家的速度和规模来说，苏联已占第一位，这在美国和英国引起了严重的惊慌。在原子工业这样最新的技术方面，根据日内瓦和平利用原子能国际会议的事实和结果，世界科学界的意见认为，苏联已达到最先进的水平。”他说苏联有发展科学的最优越的条件，“在运用科学成果到技术中和到生活中去的速度上，新的五年计划应当成为转折点。”
    并不以去年的巨大成就而自满的苏联工农业劳动者都提出在新的一年进一步增产的保证。国家规定马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合企业在1956年要增产生铁2.5％，钢6.7％，钢材7％。职工们认为这是增产的最低限度，决心发掘潜力，要增产得更多。在元旦这天，马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合企业的职工就作出了好榜样。所有高炉都超额完成任务。第七号高炉有一班超额多炼出了270吨生铁。
    除了在钢铁工厂这类昼夜三班不息地工作的企业之外，苏联人都在休息中渡过新年的第一天。元旦逢着星期天，在苏联不补假，第二天人们以饱满不懈的精神投入新的劳动中去。
