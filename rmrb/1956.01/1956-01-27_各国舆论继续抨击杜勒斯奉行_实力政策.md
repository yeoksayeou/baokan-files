Global Public Opinion Continues to Denounce Dulles’ Pursuit of a "Policy of Strength"
    “Dulles's Deception” Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, published an article entitled "Dulles's Deception" in the New York "Daily Worker" on January 20. Foster wrote: Dulles's policy of bringing the world to the brink of a massive atomic war in order to maintain world peace is a complete lie. The purpose of this policy is not only to lead the United States to the brink of war under the guise of saving world peace, but also to lead the United States into a real war. The purpose of this policy is to advance Wall Street's plan to conquer the world.
    Foster wrote: At present, one of the purposes of Dulles's "brink of war" talk is to deceive the American people in order to confuse and undermine their spirit of peace, and to coax them into regarding Dulles's large-scale arms expansion and hegemonic foreign policy as effective measures to strive for peace.
    Foster continued: If Dulles has not succeeded in forcibly creating spreading hostile actions, it is only because he has encountered insurmountable obstacles. In this regard, Foster emphasized the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world and the firm peaceful policies and skilled diplomacy of socialist countries.
    Foster wrote: Since the Geneva Conference, Dulles has been trying to undermine the Geneva spirit and destroy the great hopes for peace and disarmament aroused by the Geneva Conference among the American people. On this point, Dulles will not and cannot succeed. Dulles cannot reverse the tide of the world situation.
    "U.S. Policy Supports Dying Colonialism" The "Hindustan Times," commenting on Dulles's recent "brink of war" speech, said: "If the criticism of his interview with 'Life' magazine by American and British newspapers only makes him vaguely aware of his mistakes, as shown by his attempt to gloss over his interview with 'Life' magazine, then his trip to Asia will make him directly understand the reaction of this part of the world to this speech."
    The newspaper also said: "Of course, Dulles's earlier joint statement with the Portuguese Foreign Minister was a deliberate offense to India. This joint statement can only create the impression that U.S. policy under his control is supporting dying colonialism in Asia."
    "Dulles is a Bird of Ill Omen" The "Indonesia Times" published an editorial on January 23 saying that Dulles's visit to Indonesia was "untimely." The editorial pointed out that Dulles would arrive in Jakarta just as the Harahap government was about to step down and give way to a new government elected by universal suffrage.
    The editorial said that Dulles's visit to Indonesia would give the main ruling party, the Masyumi Party, a "kiss of death," aggravate people's suspicions about the Masyumi Party's pro-Western stance, and make it easier for the Masyumi Party to be excluded from the new government.
    The editorial said, "To the vast majority of people in Asian countries that do not lean to either side, Mr. Dulles is a bird of ill omen." He is a person keen on forming military blocs.
    Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange Worried About the Fate of Small Countries The "New York Times" published an interview with Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange by its Oslo correspondent, Blair. Blair visited Lange specifically after Dulles's interview with "Life" magazine was published.
    Lange's remarks clearly expressed unease. He was very worried that small countries that had assumed obligations in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization might be on the "brink of war" due to the United States' unilateral actions and be dragged into war. Lange believes that the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should conduct "broader consultations" with the small countries participating in this military bloc. Lange said that Dulles's remarks once again proved that big countries should "change their methods of consultation" because this is related to small countries.
    "Stupid" Diplomacy The American weekly "The Nation" published an editorial on January 21 criticizing Dulles's diplomacy and demanding Dulles's resignation.
    The editorial believes that Dulles's interview with "Life" magazine shows that Dulles is carrying out "stupid" diplomacy, and this interview has aroused widespread anger.
    The editorial said that in the coming months, the U.S. "State Department must deal with a series of very serious problems," such as "what to do with the Baghdad Pact due to Turkey's domestic economic chaos and Jordan's refusal to participate in the Baghdad Pact"; "the situation in Greece may change due to the elections scheduled for February 19 in Greece"; "the intensification of the situation in Algeria and Morocco"; "how to enhance relations between the United States and the United Kingdom"; "how to prevent the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from falling apart"; how to deal with the "worldwide hostile reaction that may occur due to the United States' planned hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific this spring"; how to prevent Myanmar and Canada from "making trouble" over the United States' dumping of surplus agricultural products; how to deal with the situation that will inevitably arise when some national governments "begin to recognize the East German regime despite Bonn's serious warnings"; "the issue of relations between China and the United States"; and "re-examining the new balance of power in the United Nations," and so on. The editorial said, "Dulles is clearly a person who is not competent to handle these difficult tasks," so "Dulles should resign now."
    The editorial also talked about the issue of American "aid" to backward areas. The editorial acknowledged that the hunger and other social evils in these areas are the "final result of 300 years of continuous rule" by Western countries, and the people in these areas have already or are awakening. The editorial believes that Dulles has adopted an "unwise approach" to the "aid" issue. The editorial said, isn't it strange that Dulles boasts about military alliances, the United States has consistently not supported the United Nations Special Fund for Economic Development in the United Nations, but now he is talking about the issue of "aid" to backward areas?

### 各国舆论继续抨击杜勒斯奉行“实力政策”

    各国舆论继续抨击杜勒斯奉行“实力政策”
    “杜勒斯的骗术”　　美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特在1月20日的纽约“工人日报”上发表了一篇题目叫做“杜勒斯的骗术”的文章，福斯特写道：杜勒斯所说的为了保持世界和平而把世界带到一场大规模的原子战争边缘去的政策是弥天大谎，这个政策的目的不仅仅是要假借拯救世界和平的名义把美国引向战争边缘，而且是要把美国引到真正的战争里去；这个政策的目的是要推进华尔街的征服世界的计划。
    福斯特写道：在目前，杜勒斯的“战争边缘”谈话的一个目的是要蒙蔽美国人民，以便混淆和破坏他们的和平精神，哄骗他们把杜勒斯替美国盘算的大规模扩军和专横的外交政策当作是争取和平的有效措施。
    福斯特继续写道：如果说杜勒斯在强行造成蔓延开的敌对行动方面没有得逞，那只是因为他遭遇到不可克服的障碍。在这方面，福斯特强调指出了全世界人民的和平愿望和社会主义国家的坚定的和平政策和熟练的外交。
    福斯特写道：从日内瓦会议以来，杜勒斯一直在设法破坏日内瓦精神并且破坏日内瓦会议在美国人民中间引起的对和平和裁军的巨大希望。在这一点上，杜勒斯不会也不能成功。杜勒斯不可能扭转世界局势的潮流。
    “美国政策支持垂死的殖民主义”“印度斯坦时报”在评论杜勒斯最近发表的“战争边缘”的谈话的时候说：“如果美国和英国报纸对他向‘生活’杂志发表的谈话的抨击只使他模糊地认识到他的错误，像他的想把他对‘生活’杂志发表的谈话搪塞过去的企图所表明的那样，那么他的亚洲之行将使他直接领会到世界这一部分对这篇谈话的反应。”
    这家报纸又说：“当然，杜勒斯早些时候和葡萄牙外交部长发表联合声明是故意触犯印度，这个联合声明只能使人产生这样的印象：在他控制下的美国政策是支持在亚洲的垂死的殖民主义的。”
    “杜勒斯是一只恶兆之鸟”“印度尼西亚时报”在1月23日发表社论说，杜勒斯的访问印度尼西亚是“不合时宜的”。社论指出，杜勒斯到达雅加达的时候将正是哈拉哈普政府行将下台而让位给普选产生的新政府的时候。
    社论说，杜勒斯的访问印度尼西亚将会给主要执政党马斯友美党以“死亡的一吻”，加重人们对马斯友美党的亲西方的怀疑，并且会使马斯友美党更容易被排斥在新政府之外。
    社论说，“对亚洲不倒向任何一方的各国的绝大多数人民而言，杜勒斯先生是一只恶兆之鸟”，他是一个热衷于搞军事集团的人。
    挪威外长兰基担心小国的命运“纽约时报”刊载了它驻奥斯陆记者伯莱尔的一篇挪威外交大臣兰基访问记，伯莱尔是在杜勒斯对“生活”杂志的谈话发表后特地去访问兰基的。
    兰基的谈话明显地表示了不安，他很担忧在北大西洋公约组织中承担了义务的小国可能由于美国的单独行动而濒于“战争的边缘”，并且被拖入战争。兰基认为，北大西洋公约组织的领导人应当同参加这个军事集团的小国进行“更广泛的协商”。兰基说，杜勒斯的谈话又一次证明大国应当“改变自己的协商方法”，因为这是同小国有关的。
    “蠢笨的”外交　　1月21日一期的美国“民族”周刊发表社论，指责杜勒斯的外交，要求杜勒斯辞职。
    社论认为，杜勒斯对“生活”杂志的谈话说明了杜勒斯正在执行“蠢笨的”外交，这个谈话激起了广泛的愤怒。
    社论说，在未来几个月中，美国“国务院必须应付一系列非常严重的问题”，例如“由于土耳其国内经济混乱、约旦拒绝参加巴格达条约……对于这个条约怎样办”；“由于希腊订于2月19日举行选举，希腊局势可能改观”；“阿尔及尔和摩洛哥局势的尖锐化”；“如何增进美英两国的关系”；“如何使北大西洋公约组织不致脱节”；如何应付美国“订于今春在太平洋举行氢弹试验可能发生的全世界的敌视反应”；如何使缅甸和加拿大对美国向外倾销剩余农产品“不闹别扭”；如何处理当一些国家政府“不顾波恩的严重警告开始承认东德政权时肯定将产生的局势”；“中美两国的关系问题”；以及“重新审查联合国中新的均势”等等。社论说，“杜勒斯显然是一个不能胜任处理这些问题的艰巨任务的人”，因此“杜勒斯现在应该去职”。
    社论还谈到美国对落后地区的“援助”的问题。社论承认，在这些地区，群众饥饿和其他社会罪恶所以产生是西方国家进行“300年的不断的统治的最后结果”，而这些地区的人民已经或者正在觉醒。社论认为，杜勒斯对于“援助”问题采取了“不高明的方式”。社论说，杜勒斯夸耀军事联盟，美国在联合国一贯不支持联合国经济发展特别基金计划，而现在却谈到“援助”落后地区问题，这难道不令人感到奇怪吗？
