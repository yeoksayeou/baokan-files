Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd -- The National Rural Postal and Telecommunications Work Conference has put forward a preliminary plan for the development of rural postal and telecommunications: within seven years, the country will build a telephone network connecting townships and large agricultural production cooperatives, and will complete it as early as possible; the telephone lines connecting townships will require the construction of approximately one million gan cheng kilometers of new lines, and the telephone lines connecting large agricultural production cooperatives will require the construction of tens of thousands of kilometers of new lines. Regarding rural postal services, by 1962, postal and telecommunications service agencies will be established in rural market towns and necessary townships, and the scale of development will be approximately six times that of 1955; by 1957, township postal routes, with the exception of a very small number of remote townships, will all be developed to the township level.

The representatives from various regions attending the meeting, after more than 10 days of discussion, unanimously agreed that accelerating the construction of rural postal and telecommunications, strengthening and improving rural postal and telecommunications services, rapidly implementing the agricultural production cooperative postman system, and actively expanding the distribution of newspapers and periodicals in rural areas are urgent and important tasks for current and future rural postal and telecommunications work.

The meeting believes that giving play to the enthusiasm of all postal and telecommunications workers, especially giving play to the socialist enthusiasm of the rural masses, is the decisive prerequisite for completing and striving to complete this plan as soon as possible. In carrying out rural postal and telecommunications construction, postal and telecommunications departments in various regions must also achieve economy, applicability, and adaptation to the needs of rural socialist construction.

This meeting was held in Beijing from December 16 to 28, 1955.

　　全国发展乡村邮电的初步规划确定
    据新华社2日讯　全国乡村邮电工作会议提出了发展乡村邮电的初步规划：全国要在七年内建成乡和大型农业生产合作社的电话网，并尽一切可能提前建成；通乡的电话约需新建一百万左右杆程公里的线路，通大型农业生产合作社的电话需新建几十万公里的线路。关于乡村邮政，到1962年要在农村的集镇和必要的乡都设立邮电服务机构，发展规模将为1955年的六倍左右；到1957年，乡邮路线除极少数边远地区的乡以外，要全部发展到乡。
    到会的各地代表经过10多天的讨论，一致认为加快乡村邮电建设，加强和改进乡村邮电服务工作，迅速推行农业生产合作社邮递员制度，积极扩大农村的报刊发行，是当前和今后乡村邮电工作的迫切而重大的任务。
    会议认为，发挥全体邮电职工的积极性，特别是发挥农村群众的社会主义积极性，是完成和争取尽快完成这一规划的决定性前提。各地邮电部门在进行乡村邮电建设中，还必须作到经济、适用和适应乡村社会主义建设的需要。
    这次会议是从1955年12月16日到28日在北京举行的。
