The Ministry of Railways has recently formulated preferential measures for students to purchase hard-seat passenger train tickets during holidays, in order to facilitate students traveling by train during summer, winter, and spring breaks. The measures stipulate that students returning home or going for internships during the holidays can purchase round-trip hard-seat passenger train tickets at half price upon certification from their schools.

    铁道部优待学生假期乘坐火车
    铁道部在最近制定了学生假期购买硬席客车票的优待办法，以便利学生在暑假、寒假和春假期间乘坐火车。这个办法规定，在假期内回家或实习的学生，购买往返硬席客车票时，经过学校证明，可以半价购票。
