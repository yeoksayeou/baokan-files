Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    Construction has begun on the Zhuzhou Coal Preparation Plant, the first automated coal preparation plant south of the Yangtze River. The plant is located in Zhuzhou City, at the intersection of the Yuehan Railway and the Zhegan Railway. Raw coal produced by state-owned Pingxiang, Zixing and other coal mines can be transported directly to the plant for washing and preparation. The refined coal produced by washing can also be transported directly to the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise by train as a raw material for coke production. The by-products of the coal washing plant—middlings and coal slime—can also be supplied to factories and residents for fuel.

    株洲选煤厂开始建设
    长江以南的第一个自动化选煤厂——株洲选煤厂开始建设。这个选煤厂厂址在粤汉铁路和浙赣铁路交叉点株洲市。国营萍乡、资兴等煤矿生产的原煤，可以由火车直接运到厂内洗选，经过洗选的精煤，也可以由火车直接运到武汉钢铁联合企业作为炼制焦炭的原料。洗煤厂的副产品——中煤和煤泥，还可以供应工厂和居民作燃料用。
