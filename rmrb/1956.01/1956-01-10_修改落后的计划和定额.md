Revising Outdated Plans and Quotas
    By our reporter Jin Yukun

　　The broad masses of workers are launching a struggle to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Facing this new situation, enterprise leaders should stand at the forefront of the masses, actively lead them forward, and must change the current conservative tendency of some enterprise leaders lagging behind the masses and lagging behind reality. This conservative tendency is manifested in the fact that when formulating plans, they do not fully tap the potential within the enterprise and do not fully estimate the strength of the masses. In the process of discussing plans, the enthusiasm of the masses often far exceeds the enthusiasm of the leadership. In the process of implementing plans, the level actually achieved often far exceeds the level of the plan.

　　Some of the main indicators of the 1956 annual plan recently preliminarily formulated by the Shenyang Smelter are behind the actual situation. For example, the lead recovery rate of the lead reverberatory furnace in the first quarter is planned to be only 93%, and the plan from the second quarter to the end of the year is only 94%. However, the highest in the fourth quarter of 1955 has reached 97%, and the average has also reached 95%. The workers believe that it is entirely possible to reach more than 95% this year. The recovery rate of special grade lead and some other important indicators are also behind last year's actual level.

　　The situation of the plan lagging behind the actual situation already existed in the Shenyang Smelter last year. At the beginning of last year, when workers discussed the national plan, they proposed using the "adding iron filings" method to recover a large amount of lead lost from copper matte, increasing the lead recovery rate from 88% to 90%. However, the leaders of this factory believed that 90% was "too adventurous" and that "it would be good to reach 88%!" They forcibly suppressed the 90% proposed by the workers to 88%. The workers said: "We will still do it according to 90%!"

　　However, due to the leadership's lack of support for the workers' initiative, the "adding iron filings" method was not implemented, and even the backward quota was not achieved in the first half of the year. It was not until the second half of the year when the higher authorities increased the task that the factory leaders had to go deep into the workshops and consult with the masses, and support and help the workers to conduct the "adding iron filings" experiment. As a result, the lead recovery rate rapidly rose to 93%-95%, and finally reached 97%.

　　In fact, the "adding iron filings" method was proposed by Soviet experts as early as 1952, and veteran workers such as Meng Zhaode had also secretly experimented with it, but it was not realized because the former technical team leader Li Fangyun did not believe it.

　　The Shenyang Smelter produces non-ferrous metals of extremely high value. Taking lead as an example, every 1% increase in the recovery rate can increase the country's wealth by 180,000 yuan a year. If this suggestion had been implemented earlier, the country could have earned at least several million yuan more in the past two or three years!

　　Why have the leaders of the Shenyang Smelter lagged behind the masses for several years? The most important reason is that they are satisfied with the factory's comprehensive overfulfillment of the national plan every year, satisfied with the straight-line increase in the level of production, and fascinated by the current "good life." They believe that "many indicators are already close to international levels" and doubt "whether it is still possible to improve." Their plan is: as long as they can safely and steadily preserve the "old capital," it will be very good, neither too "prominent" nor too backward, and even if they walk slowly like this, they are still much more "advanced" than others.

　　They are both satisfied with the status quo and, like "women with bound feet," always complain that the workers are "advancing too fast." When the masses propose higher quotas, they "persuade" the workers in many ways, asking them to be "realistic" and "rather be safe than sorry." Some workshop directors even become "panic-stricken" as soon as they hear about mobilizing the masses to discuss plans, fearing that the masses will "blindly" raise the quotas "out of momentary enthusiasm." They often overestimate the difficulties, only seeing the negative and unfavorable factors, and not seeing the positive and favorable factors. For example, when discussing the recovery rate of electrolytic zinc last year, the workshop director only saw that the change in raw materials and the increase in processes increased metal losses; he did not see that the increase in the grade of raw materials could improve the recovery rate. In fact, the amount of recovery increased due to the increase in the grade of raw materials exceeds the amount lost due to the increase in processes. Because this director only calculated half of the account, when the masses believed that the recovery rate could reach 82%, he believed that it could not exceed 81% under any circumstances. As a result, from February, the recovery rate exceeded 82%; after July, thanks to the labor model Liang Zhifu and others solving the problem of acid leakage, the recovery rate rose to 86%!

　　This satisfaction and maintenance of the status quo is reflected in the leadership style as a serious detachment from the masses and from reality. The leadership work of the Shenyang Smelter in the past was relatively thorough and dared to create. However, in recent years, this momentum has greatly diminished, and the number of times leaders go deep into the front lines has become less and less. According to a factory director's statistics, the time spent in meetings each week is about 35 to 39 hours; a workshop director's statistics show that the time spent in meetings each week accounts for about four full days. Leaders spend all day living in meetings, so of course they have very little time to get close to the masses. As the secretary of the factory's Party committee said: "Because we have not been close to the masses and do not understand life for a long time, we will inevitably fail to fully trust the masses and always worry that the enthusiasm of the masses may be 'unreliable.' Therefore, it is easy to accommodate backward and conservative tendencies and dare not actively support the advanced suggestions of the masses." For example, when discussing the consumption quota of potassium permanganate consumed for smelting each ton of zinc, the masses believed that it could be reduced to four kilograms, but the workshop director insisted on five kilograms. The factory leaders participated in this debate, but because they were not sure and did not go deep into the masses to understand, they were afraid that the masses would be "unreliable" and put a "burden" on the leadership; in order to be "confident," they agreed to the conservative quota of the workshop director. However, in just a few days, the quota was reduced to about two kilograms, and from May, manganese ore powder was used instead of the very expensive potassium permanganate, saving more than 200,000 yuan throughout the year.

　　Life does not move forward according to the path prescribed by conservatives. In the first half of 1955, more than two-thirds of the technical and economic quotas of the Shenyang Smelter were not met. However, in the second half of the year, due to the active actions of the workers and masses to oppose the conservatism of the leadership, 22 important technical and economic quotas of the entire factory were broken through in just two months. What is particularly touching is that the "six major key points" that had been regarded as a "burden" and could not be broken through for four or five years were also broken through. Therefore, the second half of the year not only made up for the losses of the first half of the year, but also overfulfilled the tasks every month. This vivid fact shows that after several years of education by the Party, the workers of the Shenyang Smelter have a relatively high level of awareness and great enthusiasm. If there are any difficulties, they can be overcome as long as they are consulted with.

　　Now, the Shenyang Smelter Party organization is deeply mobilizing the masses, carrying out criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up, revising outdated plans and quotas, and striving to complete the tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan in four years. The enthusiasm of the workers is unprecedentedly high. As one worker said: "Now the peasants are responding to Chairman Mao's call even more enthusiastically than we are. We are the leading class, and we cannot fall behind. We must run forward. Therefore, we ask the leadership to revise the conservative plan and strive to realize socialism ahead of schedule!" Similar conservative tendencies of the leadership staff of the Shenyang Smelter also exist in other enterprises. We hope that the leadership staff of these enterprises will truly rely on the masses, overcome conservative thinking, and actively lead the masses forward when formulating and implementing the 1956 production plan.

### 修改落后的计划和定额

　　修改落后的计划和定额
    本报记者　金雨困
    广大的职工群众正在展开争取提前完成第一个五年计划的斗争。企业的领导者面临这种新的情况，应该站在群众的前面，积极领导群众前进，必须改变目前某些企业领导落后于群众、落后于实际的保守主义倾向。这种保守倾向表现在制定计划的时候，不充分发掘企业内部的潜力，没有充分估计到群众的力量。在讨论计划过程中，往往是群众的积极性远远超过领导的积极性。在执行计划过程中，往往是实际达到的水平，远远超过计划的水平。
    沈阳冶炼厂最近初步制定的1956年年度计划的一些主要指标，都落后于实际。如铅反射炉的铅回收率第一季度计划仅93％，第二季度到年底的计划仅94％。而1955年第四季度最高已经达到97％，平均也达到了95％，职工群众认为今年要达到95％以上是完全可能的。特号铅的回收率和其它的一些重要指标，也落后于去年的实际水平。
    计划落后于实际的情况，沈阳冶炼厂在去年就有了。去年年初职工讨论国家计划的时候，曾提出用“加铁屑”的办法，从冰铜中取回大量流失的铅，把铅回收率由88％提高到90％。但是，这个工厂的领导人员认为90％“太冒进”，认为“达到88％就不错！”硬把工人提出的90％压到88％。工人说：“我们还是照90％干！”
    但是，由于领导上不支持工人的创议，“加铁屑”的办法没有实现，上半年连落后的定额也没达到。直到下半年上级又增加了任务，工厂的领导人员不得不深入车间和群众商量，支持和帮助工人们进行“加铁屑”的试验。结果，铅的回收率迅速上升到93％—95％，最后达到了97％。
    其实“加铁屑”的办法，早在1952年苏联专家就提出来了，老工人孟兆德等也偷着试验过了，只是由于前任技术组长李芳云不相信，没有实现。
    沈阳冶炼厂生产的是价值极高的有色金属。以铅为例，回收率每提高1％，一年就可以给国家增加18万元的财富。如果这个建议及早实现，在过去两、三年中，国家至少可以多收入几百万元！
    为什么沈阳冶炼厂的领导，几年来都落后于群众呢？最主要的是他们满足于工厂年年全面超额完成国家计划，满足于生产水平直线上升，醉心于现在的“日子过得不错”。他们认为“现在许多指标已经接近国际水平”，怀疑“是否还有可能提高”。他们的打算是：只要能平平安安地保住“老本”就很好，既不要太“冒头”，也不要太落后，就是这样慢慢走也还是比人家“先进”得多。
    他们既满足于现状，就像“小脚女人”一样，老是埋怨工人“冒得太快”。当群众提出更高的定额的时候，他们就多方“说服”工人，要求工人“实事求是”，“宁可保险，不可冒险”。有的车间主任甚至一听到要发动群众讨论计划，就“提心吊胆”，害怕群众“凭一时热情”“盲目”提高了定额。他们往往过高地估计困难，只看到消极的不利的因素，而看不到积极的有利的因素。例如去年讨论电解锌的回收率的时候，车间主任只看到因原料变化，增加工序，增加了金属损失；没有看到因原料品位增高，可以提高回收率。实际上，原料品位提高而增加的回收数量要超过因工序增加所损失的数量。因为这位主任只算了一半账，当群众认为回收率可能达到82％的时候，他却认为无论如何也不能超过81％。结果，从2月份起，回收率就超过了82％；7月份以后，由于劳动模范梁志福等解决了跑酸漏液问题，回收率竟上升到86％！
    这种满足和维持现状的思想表现在领导作风上，就是严重的脱离群众，脱离实际。沈阳冶炼厂过去的领导工作还比较深入，也敢于创造。但是近年来这种劲头大大减退了，领导人员深入现场的情况越来越少了。据一个厂长的统计，每周开会的时间约35至39小时；一个车间主任统计，每周开会的时间约占四整天。领导人员整天生活在会议中，当然接近群众的时间就很少了。正如这个厂的党委书记所说：“由于长时间不接近群众，不了解生活，就必然不能充分信任群众，而总是担心群众的热情可能‘靠不住’。因此，就容易迁就落后保守的倾向，不敢积极支持群众中先进的建议”。例如在讨论冶炼每吨锌所消耗的高锰酸钾消耗定额的时候，群众认为可降至四公斤，但是车间主任非坚持五公斤不可。厂的领导人员参加了这个争论，但是由于心里没有底，又没有深入群众进行了解，就怕群众“靠不住”，给领导“背包袱”；为了“有把握”，就同意了车间主任的保守定额。但是没有几天，定额就降到了二公斤左右，从5月份起就全部用锰矿粉代替了价格很贵的高锰酸钾，全年可节约20多万元。
    生活并不是按照保守主义者规定的道路前进的。沈阳冶炼厂在1955年上半年，有三分之二以上的技术经济定额都没达到。但是，下半年，由于职工群众积极行动起来，反对领导上的保守，短短的两个月中就突破了全厂22个重要技术经济定额。特别令人感动的是，四、五年来一直被当作“包袱”无法突破的“六大关键”也被突破了。因此，下半年不仅弥补了上半年的亏损，而且月月超额完成了任务。这个生动的事实说明：经过几年来党的教育，沈阳冶炼厂的职工觉悟是比较高的，劲头很大，有什么困难，只要同他们商量，是可以克服的。
    现在，沈阳冶炼厂党组织正在深入发动群众，开展由下而上的批评和自我批评，修改落后的计划和定额，争取在四年内完成五年计划规定的任务。职工群众的积极性空前高涨。正如一个工人所说：“现在农民响应毛主席的号召比我们还热烈，我们是领导阶级，不能掉在后边，一定要跑上前去。因此我们要求领导修改保守的计划，努力争取提前实现社会主义！”类似沈阳冶炼厂领导工作人员这样的保守倾向，在其它企业里也是有的。我们希望这些企业的领导工作人员在制定和执行1956年生产计划的时候，一定要切实依靠群众，克服保守思想，积极领导群众前进。
