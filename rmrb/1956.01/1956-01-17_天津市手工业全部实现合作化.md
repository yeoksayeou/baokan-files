Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 16th: Tianjin's handicraft industry has entirely achieved cooperativization as of today. In this month, more than 57,000 handicraft workers in Tianjin have joined cooperatives. Together with the more than 25,000 who had previously joined, almost all of the city's handicraft workers have joined cooperative organizations. Currently, there are more than 600 cooperative organizations in the city.

Since late December of last year, handicraft workers in Tianjin have been requesting to organize themselves by district or by entire industry. The relevant leading departments in Tianjin, on the one hand, organized handicraft transformation work teams and work groups to vigorously carry out propaganda and education and organizational development work. On the other hand, they conducted pilot projects for the full-industry cooperativization in the vehicle and rubber sundries industries, drawing experience from them for large-scale development. This ensured that the city's handicraft industry rapidly and orderly achieved cooperativization.

Tianjin's handicraft industry includes forging, machine repair and woodworking industries that serve agricultural production, knitting and other industries that produce daily necessities for the people, and carpet and sausage casing processing industries that are sold far and wide abroad, totaling more than 40 industries, producing more than 1,000 kinds of products, with an annual output value of about 200 million yuan.

    天津市手工业全部实现合作化
    新华社天津16日电　天津市手工业到今天为止，已经全部实现了合作化。在这一个月中，天津市手工业者参加合作社的共有57，000多人，连同以前入社的25，000多人在内，全市的手工业者几乎都参加了合作组织。目前，全市已经有600多个合作组织。
    去年12月下旬以来，天津市已经有全区或整行业的手工业者要求组织起来。天津市有关领导部门一面组织手工业改造工作队和工作组大力展开宣传教育和组织发展工作，一面又在车具、橡胶杂品两个行业中进行了全业合作化的试点工作，从中吸取了大发展的经验，因此保证了全市手工业迅速地有秩序地达到合作化。
    天津市的手工业中有为农业生产服务的锻铁、机器修配和木器制造业，有生产人民生活必需品的针织等业，有远销国外的地毯和肠衣等加工业，共40多个行业，生产1，000多种产品，年产值约2亿元左右。
