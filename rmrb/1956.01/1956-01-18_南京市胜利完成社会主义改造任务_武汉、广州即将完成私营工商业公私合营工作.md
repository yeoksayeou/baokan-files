    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 17th: Nanjing has successfully completed the socialist transformation tasks of the first Five-Year Plan and has entered socialist society. As of the 16th, 22 advanced agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the suburbs of Nanjing, with farmer households joining the cooperatives reaching 90% of the total number of farmer households in the suburbs. Of the city's 32,000+ handicraftsmen, more than 95% had joined handicraft cooperative organizations by the evening of the 16th. All private industrial and commercial enterprises in the city have fully implemented joint state-private ownership.

    On the 17th, a reporting team composed of 8,000 members of advanced suburban cooperatives, workers and capitalists from joint state-private enterprises, handicraftsmen, and small vendors, reported the good news to the Jiangsu Province and Nanjing leadership. Jiang Weiqing, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, Hui Yuyu, Governor of Jiangsu Province, Xu Jiatun, Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee, and Peng Chong, Mayor of Nanjing, received their good news reports. Jiangsu Province Governor Hui Yuyu and Nanjing Mayor Peng Chong also spoke to them, congratulating Nanjing on the victory of socialist transformation.

    On the afternoon of the 17th, 300,000 workers, farmers, capitalists, handicraft cooperative members, and people from all walks of life in Nanjing held a celebratory parade. In the evening, all cinemas and theaters in the city staged performances for over 50,000 workers, farmers, capitalists, small vendors, handicraftsmen, and government cadres to enjoy together.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 17th: Private industrial and commercial enterprises in Wuhan will all implement joint state-private ownership before the 20th. All private stall vendors and handicraftsmen in the city will also implement cooperativization during this period.

    In recent days, the vast majority of private industrialists, businessmen, and handicraftsmen in Wuhan have submitted applications to the People's Government in batches to implement joint state-private ownership and organization, requesting the government to lead them to accelerate the implementation of socialist transformation. Many capitalists and handicraftsmen have submitted applications to the government four or five times.

    The Wuhan leadership recently examined and criticized the phenomenon that the city's private industrial, commercial and handicraft transformation work in the past period did not fully mobilize and rely on the masses, and that the leadership lagged behind the masses. In order to change this phenomenon, the Wuhan leadership convened the heads of relevant departments to study the urgent demands of capitalists and workers in various industries to enter socialism as soon as possible, and decided to greatly accelerate the progress of socialist transformation.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 17th: Private industrial and commercial enterprises in Guangzhou will all implement joint state-private ownership within 7 days. This was announced today by Zhao Wucheng, Second Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a symposium invited by the Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce to its executive committee and supervisory committee, in response to a request from the industrial and commercial sectors.

    At this meeting, more than 300 committee members scrambled to report on the desire for joint state-private ownership of the industries they represented or themselves. The meeting concluded with a resolution that all private industrial and commercial enterprises in the city should apply for joint state-private ownership within two days.

    In the past few days, a high tide of welcoming socialist transformation has appeared in the industrial and commercial circles of Guangzhou, and the number of factories and shops applying for joint state-private ownership is increasing not daily but hourly. This morning, 125 industries applied for overall joint state-private ownership, and by noon it had immediately increased to about 150 industries. Many industrialists and businessmen have been investing houses or gold into their enterprises in recent days. Many shareholders living in Hong Kong or Macau have also sent letters or telegrams supporting the socialist transformation of the motherland.

    武汉市领导机关最近检查和批判了过去一个时期全市私营工商业和手工业的改造工作中没有充分地发动群众和依靠群众，领导落后于群众的现象。为了改变这种现象，武汉市领导机关召集有关各部门的负责人，研究了各行业资本家和职工迫切要求早日进入社会主义的情况，决定把社会主义改造工作的进度大大地加快。
