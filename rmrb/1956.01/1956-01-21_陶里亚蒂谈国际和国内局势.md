Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 19th: "Parliament" magazine published a statement by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party Central Committee, on certain issues concerning the international and domestic situation.

    When asked about his views on the situation after the Geneva Conference of the Four Foreign Ministers, Togliatti replied: "I believe that we must more actively oppose the enemies of easing international tensions, among whom the American imperialists are the foremost. For those who have doubts in this regard, Mr. Dulles' recent arrogant remarks can serve as proof. I have no doubt that the struggle to ease international tensions will be victorious. The warmongers, at least some of them, have exposed their true colors. The countries, peoples, parties, and movements that advocate easing international tensions currently represent the majority of mankind."

    When discussing Italy's foreign policy, Togliatti emphasized, "We must implement a national foreign policy that is in line with the country's interests and contributes to consolidating Italy's independent position on the international stage."

    陶里亚蒂谈国际和国内局势
    新华社19日讯　塔斯社罗马19日讯：“议会”杂志发表了意大利共产党中央委员会总书记陶里亚蒂就国际和国内情况的某些问题所发表的谈话。
    有人问到他对于四国外交部长日内瓦会议之后的局势的看法如何，陶里亚蒂回答说：“我认为，必须更加积极地反对缓和国际紧张局势的敌人，这些人当中首先就有美帝国主义者。对于在这方面有怀疑的人，杜勒斯先生最近的狂妄言论可以作证明。我毫不怀疑争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争将获得胜利。战争贩子，至少是他们中间的某些人，自己暴露了自己的真面目。主张缓和国际紧张局势的国家、人民、党派和运动目前占人类的大部分”。
    陶里亚蒂在谈到意大利的外交政策时着重指出，“必须执行符合国家利益，有助于巩固意大利在国际舞台上的独立地位的民族的外交政策”。
