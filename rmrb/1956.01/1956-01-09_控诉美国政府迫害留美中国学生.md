Title: Accusation Against the U.S. Government for Persecuting Chinese Students in the United States

We, a group of students who recently returned to the motherland from the United States, have been away from our homes and wandering in the United States for at least seven or eight years. Most of us graduated from American schools several years ago. However, after graduation, we were detained in the United States and could not freely return to the motherland for peaceful construction, nor reunite with our parents, wives, and children. Some of our children in China have grown up to be seven or eight years old without ever seeing their biological parents, while others have elderly parents who are deeply saddened by the longing for their children and have become ill. Some have even suffered mental breakdowns due to the distress. Recently, due to the diplomatic victory of our government at the Geneva Conference and the public opinion of international progressives, the U.S. government was finally forced to release us. Recalling the various unreasonable persecutions we suffered in the United States, and thinking about the thousands of innocent Chinese students who are still being detained, we feel compelled to expose the inhuman persecution of Chinese students in the United States by the U.S. government to the people of our motherland and to people around the world. We hope that people can see through the hypocritical propaganda fabricated by the U.S. government, uphold justice, and use peaceful means of public opinion and diplomacy to urge the U.S. government to immediately stop all these persecutions and release the Chinese students who have not yet been able to return home as soon as possible.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the U.S. government has begun to persecute Chinese student organizations in the United States, forcing them to dissolve themselves (such as the Chinese Association of Scientific Workers in the United States and the North American Chinese Christian Student Association), and prohibiting Chinese students from freely gathering and forming associations. This clearly violates the freedom of religious and academic research that the United States claims to uphold. At the same time, Huang Baotong, a person in charge of the Chinese Association of Scientific Workers in the United States, was arrested and imprisoned. Although he was later released, his movements were still restricted, and he was ordered not to leave New York City until he recently returned to China. After the start of the Korean War in 1950, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service interrogated every Chinese student across the country, investigating their thoughts in detail, their attitude towards the People's Republic of China, and their opinions on the Korean War. The interrogations often lasted for five or six hours, and the students' passports were confiscated, and they were forced to give fingerprints. At the same time, orders were issued to twenty or thirty Chinese students, forcing them to drop out of school immediately and be deported. This behavior of the U.S. government aroused dissatisfaction among professors and people in general at the time. They believed that deportation would not suppress Chinese students but would instead enable more Chinese students to return home to serve their country sooner. As a result, the U.S. State Department had to withdraw the order and then convene a meeting with relevant parties from various schools, resulting in an order at the end of August 1951 prohibiting Chinese students in the United States from leaving the country. It was also specifically stipulated that Chinese students must report their personal activities to the Immigration and Naturalization Service every three months. Furthermore, it was announced that American visas had expired and that the U.S. government had the right to deport Chinese students at any time. Some students who were already on ships returning to China were also escorted back to the United States from the ship halfway. Xie Jialin, who recently returned to China, was one of them. This order was based on an old law promulgated in 1918 after the First World War, which stipulated that the U.S. government had the right to detain any immigrant. If the immigrant still attempted to leave the United States, they would be punished with a fine of up to $5,000, or imprisonment for up to five years, or both. Since then, anyone who requested to leave the United States from the Immigration and Naturalization Service has received this order. We ask, what crimes have we Chinese students committed to be detained? Only American imperialism could do such arbitrary and despotic acts of arbitrarily judging without being able to accuse someone of crimes. From this, one can see the true face of the so-called democracy and freedom of the U.S. government.

From this time on, agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation created an atmosphere of terror among the students. Anyone who read progressive newspapers and magazines or possessed publications published in New China was considered to be suspected of propagating communism and attempting to overthrow the U.S. government. For example, Chen Nengkuan was ordered to be deported based on the above-mentioned charges, while at the same time not allowed to leave the country. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation also secretly inquired about the thoughts and actions of another student. At the same time, they condoned Kuomintang agents to spread rumors and cause trouble. For example, they fabricated baseless news such as the internationally renowned mathematician Hua Luogeng committing suicide by jumping off a building after returning to China, in order to make students doubt the new regime of the motherland. On the other hand, they vigorously propagated the oppression of religion in New China to students with religious beliefs. In fact, our government not only does not oppress but also protects the people's freedom of belief. The U.S. government further sent agents to monitor the group activities of students in various places. As a result, students could not openly and freely discuss any political opinions.

Some students who voluntarily requested "deportation" to return to their motherland were falsely accused of being communist spies and imprisoned. Many students who requested to go to Europe, Canada, or South American countries for further study or to participate in academic research conferences, etc., were also not allowed to leave the country based on the same law. This act of obstructing cultural exchange and depriving academic research freedom should also be severely condemned by fair-minded people all over the world. Student Zhang Shiduo left the United States and returned to China via Canada through Alaska, but was escorted back to the United States en route. Such acts of persecution are too numerous to mention.

Since the Geneva talks began, the U.S. government has claimed that only a few dozen of the five thousand Chinese students in the United States requested to return to their motherland. This is truly deceptive and distorted propaganda. In general, the students already knew that the U.S. government had decided to prohibit Chinese students from leaving the United States, and they had heard and witnessed the various persecutions suffered by applicants, and they understood that even if they applied to return to China, they would be detained in the same way. Therefore, after dozens of people had been unreasonably detained, everyone dared not apply again to avoid encountering obstacles and possibly tragic consequences. In fact, the vast majority of students in the United States are eager to return to their motherland as soon as possible. At the same time, the results of the Geneva talks were only published in "The New York Times." Local newspapers in various places never published the details, and the reports were extremely simple, so that the students did not fully understand the results of the talks. Students who knew there was hope of returning to China have flocked to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to request permission to leave the United States based on the agreement reached between China and the United States on the issue of civilians returning to their respective countries. However, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has adopted delaying tactics and has still ignored the requests of many students. On the other hand, they have used methods of coercion and inducement against Chinese students, promulgating the so-called Refugee Relief Act to entice Chinese students in the United States to apply for permanent residence or to become American citizens.

After the Geneva talks, the U.S. government had no choice but to release some Chinese students, and then carried out various persecutions. For example, some students were given a very short period of time to leave the country. If they could not leave the country on time due to special circumstances, they would be arrested and then escorted all the way to the Chinese border according to the deportation procedure. Furthermore, returning students were only allowed to take certain ships with designated sailing dates, and such ships only sailed on average once every two months. If a student missed one ship for some reason, they would have to wait another two months. Some students have suffered great economic losses as a result.

Since the liberation of mainland China, the U.S. government has ordered Chinese students to be prohibited from remitting money to their parents, wives, and children who remained in the motherland. Violators would be sentenced to up to five years in prison or fined up to $10,000, or both. They are not allowed to return home, nor are they allowed to remit money home. How can parents, wives, and children who have no ability to produce and no support survive? This inhuman behavior must be sanctioned by international public opinion!

The vast majority of the American people are unaware of the various persecutions of Chinese students in the United States by the U.S. government. When we talked to some American people about it, they were very surprised and voiced their disapproval. Some fair organizations and progressive newspapers also gave us moral and public opinion support. We will never forget the friendship of those fair-minded and peace-loving people.

Dear people of our motherland and people all over the world: We hope that you can seriously investigate these acts of persecution by the U.S. government that violate human rights, and then do your best to use righteous public opinion and peaceful means to prevent these arbitrary and despotic atrocities from happening again in this civilized era of the 20th century. Thousands of displaced innocent students and their parents, wives, and children are eagerly awaiting your assistance. We hope that in the near future, these thousands of Chinese students in the United States can freely return to their beloved motherland and joyfully reunite with the vast number of peace-loving people.

### 控诉美国政府迫害留美中国学生

　　控诉美国政府迫害留美中国学生
    我们这一批最近由美归返祖国的同学们，都曾背井离乡、流落在美国至少有七八年之久了。大部分同学都是几年前就早已从美国学校毕业。而毕业后即被羁留在美国，不能自由归返祖国为和平建设，和与父母妻儿相团聚。有的是国内的儿女已长成七八岁而未见过生身父母，有的是年老双亲思念儿女心切而忧郁成疾。有的因受刺激而精神失常。最近由于我国政府在日内瓦会议中外交的胜利及国际进步人士的舆论，美国政府终于不得不被迫而释放我们。回想在美时所受种种无理迫害，又想到尚有数千清白无辜的中国留学生仍然继续被羁留着，使我们不得不向祖国人民及全世界人士揭露美国政府对我留美同学种种非人道的迫害行为。我们希望人们能深刻地看穿美国政府所捏造的虚伪宣传，而能主持正义，用舆论及外交的和平方式促使美国政府立刻停止这一切迫害行为，而及早释放尚未能归国的留美同学。
    自从1949年中国人民政府成立后，美国政府即开始迫害在美的中国学生团体组织，以致不得不自行解散（例如中国留美科学工作者协会，北美中国基督教学生联合会等），禁止中国学生自由集会结社。这显然违背美国所标榜的宗教学术研究自由。同时对中国留美科学工作者协会一负责人黄葆同同学加以逮捕而送入监牢。后虽被释放然行动仍不自由，命令黄同学不能离开纽约市，一直到他最近回国为止。1950年抗美援朝开始后，美国移民局在全国各地询问每一位中国同学。详细调查每位同学的思想，对中国人民政府的态度，以及对抗美援朝的意见。询问时常长达五六小时之久，并将同学出国护照扣留还强迫打手印。同时并下令给二三十位中国同学迫其立刻辍学并驱逐出境。美国政府此种行为，当时引起一般教授及社会人士的不满。他们认为驱逐出境并不能压制中国学生，反而能使更多中国同学早日回国服务。于是美国国务院不得不把成命收回，然后召集各校有关方面会议，结果于1951年8月底下令禁止留美中国同学离境。并特别规定中国学生每三个月向移民局报告一次个人行动。并且宣布在美国签证业已过期，美政府有随时驱逐中国同学出境的权利。有些已经上船在归国途中的同学，也被半途由原船押解回美。最近回国的谢家麟同学就是其中之一。这命令是根据第一次欧战后，1918年颁布的老朽法律规定美国政府有权扣留任何移民。如果该移民仍然企图离美，就处罚五千美元以下罚金，或判五年以下徒刑，或者两者兼施。自此以后凡向移民局请求离美境者都收到这种命令。试问我们留美学生身犯何罪而被扣留？这种无法加以罪名而任意裁判的专横霸道行为，只有美帝国主义才能做得出来。由此可以看得出美国政府的所谓民主自由的真面目了。
    自此时起，美国联邦调查局特务便在同学间造成恐怖空气。凡阅读进步报章杂志者或持有新中国出版刊物者，就被认为有宣传共产主义，企图推翻美政府的嫌疑。例如陈能宽同学就被根据上列罪名下令驱逐出境，同时又不准离境。美国移民局和联邦调查局并时常向同学秘密问询另一同学的思想行动。同时，一方面纵容国民党特务造谣生事。例如制造回国的国际闻名数学家华罗庚先生跳楼自杀等无稽新闻，俾使同学对祖国新政权发生怀疑。另一方面又对有宗教信仰的同学大肆宣传新中国对宗教的压迫。其实我国政府不但不压迫而且保护人民信仰自由。美国政府更进一步派特务监视各地同学的团体活动。于是同学们都不能公开自由谈论任何政治意见。
    有些自动要求“驱逐出境”返归祖国的同学，便被诬赖是共产党间谍而被监禁。很多同学请求去欧洲、加拿大或南美各国深造或参加学术研究会等，也都根据同样法律不准离境。这种阻挠文化流通，剥夺学术研究自由的行为，也应该遭受到全世界公正人士的严厉指责。同学张士铎已离美经加拿大假道阿拉斯加返国，途中又被押解回美。诸如此类迫害行为，不胜枚举。
      自日内瓦会谈开始，美国政府即宣传五千多留美中国学生中，仅有数十人要求归返祖国。这真是掩人耳目的歪曲宣传。一般同学当时已经知道美政府决定禁止中国学生离美，且耳闻目睹申请者所遭受之种种迫害，明了即使申请回国也会遭到同样的扣留，于是当几十人已经被无理羁留后，大家便不敢再去申请以免碰壁且可能招致悲惨后果。其实在美同学绝大多数都是急切希望早日回归祖国。同时对日内瓦会谈结果，仅在“纽约时报”上发表。而各地地方报纸从未发表详情，报道极为简单。以致同学对会谈结果未能十分了解。同学中知道有回国希望的，都纷纷向美国移民局请求根据中美双方就双方平民回国问题达成的协议准许离美。而美移民局则采取拖延搁置的手段，至今尚对很多同学的请求置之不理。另一方面又对中国留学生施行威逼利诱的办法，颁布所谓难民法，引诱留美同学申请永久居留，或入美籍。
    经过日内瓦会谈后，美国政府不得不释放某些中国同学，于是又进行种种迫害。例如限某些同学于极短时间内离境。如因特殊情形仓促不能按期离境者，即被逮捕然后按驱逐出境办法，由美一直押解到我国边境。又归国同学只许乘某些指定航行日期的船只，而该类航船平均每两个月才有一次。如因故赶不上一次船，则只有再等两个月。有些同学因此遭受到经济上很大的损失。
    美国政府自中国大陆解放后，即下令禁止中国留学生汇款给留在祖国的父母妻儿。违犯者处五年以下徒刑或一万美元以下罚款，或二者都执行。既不准留学生回国，又不许汇款回家。没有生产能力的父母妻儿们，无依无靠，如何度日？这种违反人道的行为，必须受到国际舆论的制裁！
    美国政府对留美中国学生的种种迫害行为，绝大多数的美国人民是不了解真相的。当我们同一些美国人民谈起的时候，他们也大为惊讶而发出不平之鸣。有些公正团体和进步报纸也给我们道义和舆论上的援助。我们对那些公正的爱好和平的人民的友谊，是不会忘怀的。
    亲爱的祖国人民及全世界人民：希望你们能认真地调查美国政府这些违反人权的迫害行为，然后尽全力用正义的舆论与和平的手段，使这些专横霸道的暴行，不再发生在这20世纪的文明时代。数千个流离失所的无辜学生们和他们的父母妻儿正迫切地期待着你们的援助。希望不久的将来，这几千个中国留美学生都能自由地归返他们热爱的祖国，和广大的爱好和平的人民们相欢聚。
