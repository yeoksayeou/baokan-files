Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: Today, more than 800 stores in over 20 industries in Beijing were approved by the government to implement joint state-private ownership. The streets were filled with joy. Early in the morning, employees and capitalists from these private stores gathered at the store entrances, decorating with lanterns and colored streamers, beating drums and gongs to welcome the work groups sent by the government. The employees wore new clothes as if it were the New Year, congratulating each other.

The Qianmenwai Dazhalan area was particularly lively, with almost all the shops on the entire street implementing joint state-private ownership. When Liu Shanting, manager of Tongjietang Traditional Chinese Medicine Store, hung the sign for joint state-private ownership at the entrance and shook hands with the public share representative, the employees jumped up with joy, clapping and cheering. To welcome this historically significant day, all the employees of this traditional Chinese medicine store launched a work competition to take stock of the goods; the accounting department employees pledged to complete the settlement of last year's accounts in the shortest possible time. Yipinqi Lianji Shoe Store completed its asset inventory several days ago. All the employees of this store stayed up all night last night to clean and tidy up all ten retail outlets and all the goods to welcome the public share representatives who would arrive today.

At a conference of capitalists in the Dongsi district, the entire venue erupted in cheers when the government announced the approval of joint state-private ownership for 330 private stores in 18 industries. Dong Huatang, the capitalist representative of Deshunxing Oil, Salt, and Grain Store, made a guarantee to the government on behalf of these stores: Under the leadership of the public share representatives and the supervision of the employees, they would do a good job in clearing assets and verifying capital, and actively improve management.

In the evening, the store employees of these industries held a parade to celebrate the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry. More than 1,500 industrialists and businessmen held up large banners that read "Actively Accept Socialist Transformation," lit red gauze lanterns, and paraded through the streets to spread the good news. Many shops set off firecrackers to welcome this team advancing towards the socialist road.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: "Achieve merit in the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry and strive to participate in the National Congress of Young Activists in Industry and Commerce." This was the initiative proposed by 43 young capitalists in Beijing at the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Youth Celebration for Joint State-Private Ownership tonight to young capitalists throughout the city. They proposed: In the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, ensure acceptance of the leadership of public shares and the supervision of workers, be dutiful and responsible, obey arrangements, conscientiously sort out assets and inventory, and estimate values realistically. Strive to achieve merit in the joint ownership of the entire industry, embark on the road to a bright future, and welcome the convening of the National Congress of Young Activists in Industry and Commerce. The speaker's voice was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause.

Tonight's celebration was held at the Beijing Hotel, with more than 1,200 young capitalists participating. During the celebration, the young capitalists performed crosstalk "Wishful Thinking," which they themselves wrote to criticize the capitalist's erroneous thinking in joint state-private ownership, and a quick-rhythm clapper talk "Celebrating Joint State-Private Ownership," and also recited the new poem "Master Your Own Destiny."

　　北京市一天中20多个行业公私合营
    北京工商界青年举行庆祝公私合营联欢会
    新华社8日讯　今天北京市有20多个行业800多家商店被政府批准实行公私合营。在街道上，到处喜气洋洋。一清早，这些私营商店的职工和资本家就齐集在商店门口张灯结彩，敲锣打鼓，欢迎政府派来的工作组下店。职工们像过新年一样都穿起了新衣裳，互相贺喜。
    特别热闹的是前门外大栅栏，整条街的商店几乎都实行了公私合营。当同济堂国药店经理刘珊亭把公私合营的牌子挂在门口以后和公股代表握手的时候，职工们都高兴得跳起来鼓掌欢呼。这个国药店全体职工为了迎接今天这个有历史意义的日子，开展了清点工作竞赛；会计部职工提出保证要在最短期间，完成去年的账目清结工作。一品齐联记鞋店在几天前就完成了资产清点工作。这个商店的全体职工昨晚通宵未睡，把十个门市部和全部商品都清扫整理完毕，迎接今天下店的公股代表。
    在东四区一个资本家的大会上，当政府宣布批准18个行业330户私营商店实行公私合营时，全场欢声雷动。德顺兴油盐粮店资方董化堂代表这些商店向政府提出了保证：在公股领导和职工群众监督下，做好清产核资工作，积极改善经营。
    入夜，这些行业的店员们举行了庆祝全行业公私合营的游行。1，500多工商业者举起了“积极接受社会主义改造”的大幅标语，点起了红纱灯，沿街游行报喜，许多商店都燃放鞭炮，欢迎这支向社会主义道路前进的队伍。
    据新华社8日讯　“在全行业公私合营中立功，争取参加全国工商界青年积极分子大会。”这是北京市43个青年资本家今晚在北京市工商界青年庆祝公私合营联欢会上向全市青年资本家提出的倡议。他们倡议：在私营工商业的社会主义改造中，保证接受公股领导和工人监督，守职尽责，服从安排，认真整理资产和库存，实事求是地估价。在全行业合营中争取立功，走上光明大道，以迎接全国工商界青年积极分子大会的召开。宣读人的声音不时被热烈的掌声所打断。
    今晚联欢会在北京饭店举行，有1，200多个青年资本家参加。在联欢时，青年资本家们演出了他们自己编的批判资本家在公私合营中错误思想的相声“如意算盘”、快板“庆祝公私合营”，还朗诵了新诗“掌握自己的命运”。
