    Shanghai will Eliminate Schistosomiasis Within Two Years
    The Shanghai Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Committee was established on the 14th. This committee will thoroughly eliminate schistosomiasis within two years according to Shanghai's schistosomiasis prevention and control plan.
    The committee estimates that all schistosomiasis patients in Shanghai can be treated this year, and at the same time, Oncomelania hupensis snails can be completely eliminated.
    The Shanghai Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Institute and the prevention and control stations in three suburban and water areas have been established, and four townships in the suburbs have launched prevention and control work. Hospitals in the urban area have set aside 450 beds specifically for patients with severe or advanced schistosomiasis. More than 100 teams, composed of more than 800 health workers, are conducting concentrated training to survey Oncomelania snails and patients and provide treatment. The suburbs will also train more than 5,000 peasant health workers in the short term, who will be responsible for some of the prevention and control work in their respective areas. 50,000 young students in the city have responded to the call of the Communist Youth League and are preparing to participate in short-term blitz operations to eliminate Oncomelania snails during the winter vacation.

    上海将在两年内消灭血吸虫病
    上海市血吸虫病防治委员会在14日成立。这个委员会将根据上海市的血吸虫病防治规划，在两年内彻底消灭血吸虫病。
    这个委员会估计，今年内上海全市的血吸虫病人可以全部得到治疗，同时可以全部消灭钉螺。
    上海市的血吸虫病防治所和三个郊区、水上区的防治站已经建立起来，郊区已经有四个乡展开了防治工作。市区各医院已经辟出450张专供较严重的或晚期的血吸虫病人使用的病床。由八百多个卫生工作人员组成的一百多个普查钉螺、病人和治疗小队，正在集中训练。各郊区也将在短期内训练出五千多个农民保健员，由他们分地段担任部分防治工作。全市已经有5万个青年学生响应青年团组织的号召，准备在寒假期间参加消灭钉螺的短期突击工作。（新华社）
