(I) To the Editors:
	I am pleased to report to you that I have completed five years of work in just over two years and nine months and am now ahead, doing the work scheduled for 1958.
	Over the past three years, my main products have been tappet caps and intake and exhaust pipes for 20-horsepower gasoline engines, and chassis for 100-ton hydraulic presses. I know that the tasks assigned to me by the state are very important, so I have actively sought to improve operating techniques and increase work efficiency. For example, in the work of casting intake and exhaust pipes, I have made seven improvements to the operating methods, shortening the casting time for each intake and exhaust pipe from 10 hours to 45 minutes.
	When I started making intake and exhaust pipes, I felt that it was too slow to make only one in 10 hours, and I had to find a trick. I discovered that the process of sending the finished model to the drying room for several hours could be eliminated. I came up with an idea and consulted with Master Hua Rongchun of the technical team, who strongly supported me in conducting experiments. Finally, my experiment was successful, and the product quality was even better than before. I also found that the internal mud core of the intake and exhaust pipe was like a monster, with three long and thin heads growing out of one body, and it was really difficult to take it out of the mud core box. In order to improve this operation, I thought of many ways, and finally found some lead wires to make six hooks, put three hooks inside the "three heads," and the other three hooked onto the hooks on the "heads," and then gently lifted it out without any problems.
	I also thought of many ways to save time. Before going to work, I always arrange all the tools I need for the day; as soon as the work bell rings, I pick them up and start working. In the few days before the end of each month, I start to make plans for the next month, first understanding how many tasks there are, how many furnaces to open, etc., and then make a daily work plan. In this way, I have a bottom line in my heart, and I won't be rushed when I start working.
	My little achievement in work is inseparable from the education of the Party. I will definitely work hard to create greater achievements and realize my guarantee to complete eight years of work in five years.

(II) To the Editors:
	I have completed the workload of the Five-Year Plan in 2 years, 11 months and 17 days. Now I propose to guarantee that I will complete eight years of work in five years.
	I started working in a factory at the age of 14, but I only started learning technology after liberation. In my work, the master workers have given me great help, so when I was making 100-ton hydraulic press cylinder bodies, 200-horsepower diesel engine chassis, and 250-horsepower diesel engine bodies, I improved the operating methods, shortened the operating time, and improved production efficiency. For example, when making the 200-horsepower diesel engine chassis, because the product's mud core was large, it required two people to assemble it. I felt that this was both time-consuming and easy to break the mud core, so I consulted Master Yuan Zhenfu to simplify this work. Later, I came up with a way to flatten this type of mud core, reducing unnecessary procedures and the manpower required for assembly, shortening the assembly time from the original 24 hours to 6 hours.
	In addition, I also used the three-cutter head chamfering method to reduce intermittent working hours and improve production efficiency. In this way, the quota working hours for producing a 200-horsepower diesel engine chassis were shortened from the original 106 hours to 40 hours.
	The little achievement I have made in my work is still very small. In the future, I am determined to study science and technology more diligently, and I must realize my guarantee to the motherland to complete eight years of work in five years.

### 要在五年内完成八年的工作量

    要在五年内完成八年的工作量
    （一）编辑同志：
    我高兴地向你们报告：我已经用两年九个多月的时间完成了五年的工作量，现在已经提前做1958年的工作了。
    在过去三年中，我所生产的主要产品是20马力汽油机的拨子帽、进排气管和100吨油压机的底盘。我知道国家交给我的任务是十分重要的，因此在工作中就积极设法改进操作技术，提高工作效率。例如，我在浇铸进排气管的工作中，先后在操作方法上作了7次改进，使每个进排气管的浇铸时间从10小时缩短到45分钟。
    我开始做进排气管的时候，觉得10小时的时间才能做一只，这样的速度太慢了，必须找个窍门才行。我发现，这个零件的模型造好以后要送到烘房里去烘几个钟头，这个生产过程是可以不要的。我就想了个办法和技术组的华荣春老师傅商量，他大力支持我进行试验。终于，我的试验成功了，产品质量比以前还好。我又发现，进排气管内部的泥心这个东西简直像个怪物，一个身子上长出三个又长又细的脑袋，要把它从泥心盒里取出来实在费事。为了改进这个操作法，我想了好多办法，最后找了些铅丝做了六个钩子，把三个钩子放在“三个脑袋”的内部，另外三个钩住“脑袋”上的钩子，这样轻轻地向上一提就取出来了，一点毛病也没有。
    我还想了很多办法节省时间。在上班以前，我总是先把当天要用的工具统统安排好；上班铃一响，举起手来就干活。我在每个月的月底以前几天内就开始订下月的计划，先了解一下有多少任务，开几次炉等，然后订出每天的工作计划。这样，心里有底，干起活来就不会手忙脚乱了。
    我在工作中的这一点成绩是和党的教育分不开的。我一定在工作中努力创造更大的成绩，实现自己提出来的五年完成八年工作量的保证。

    （二）编辑同志：
    我已经用2年11个月又17天的时间完成了五年计划的工作量。现在我提出保证，要在五年内完成八年的工作量。
    我从14岁就进工厂做工，但是开始学技术却是解放以后的事情。在工作中，老师傅们给了我很大的帮助，因此我在做100吨油压机汽缸体、200马力柴油机底盘和250马力柴油机机身的时候，改进了操作方法，缩短了操作时间，提高了生产效率。例如在做200马力柴油机底盘的时候，因为产品的泥心较大，需要两个人来装配。我觉得这样既花时间，又容易把泥心碰碎，就找袁振富老师傅商量简化这项工作的办法。后来我想出了把这一类泥心压平的办法，减少了不必要的工序和装配所需要的人力，使装配时间由原来的24小时缩短到6小时。
    此外，我还运用三刀头倒元角工作法，减少了间断工时，提高了生产效率。这样，生产200马力柴油机底盘的定额工时，就从原来的106小时缩短到40小时。
    我在工作中所取得的这一点成绩还是很微小的。今后我决心更加努力地学习科学技术，一定要实现我向祖国提出的用五年时间完成八年工作量的保证。
