The Ngo Dinh Diem Clique and Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Gang Special Agents Collude to Intensify Persecution and Exclusion of Overseas Chinese in South Vietnam

    Our correspondent in Vietnam reports: The Ngo Dinh Diem clique and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang special agents are colluding with each other, using the so-called "Movement to Accuse the Communists" as a guise, and are intensifying the persecution and exclusion of Overseas Chinese in South Vietnam.

    As early as July 1954, from the day Ngo Dinh Diem took the stage with the support of American imperialism, he began to infringe on the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese while implementing a policy of terror and suppression against the Vietnamese people. In the spring of 1955, Ngo Dinh Diem waged war against the Binh Xuyen and other sectarian armed forces, causing serious damage to cities such as Saigon and Cholon. Thousands of houses were either bombed or burned down, and tens of thousands of people were displaced, with the greatest losses suffered by Overseas Chinese, as the areas of war were the most concentrated areas of Overseas Chinese. After the war, Ngo Dinh Diem strictly prohibited relief activities, and many Vietnamese people and Overseas Chinese were arrested for providing relief to the people in the disaster areas. Starting in the summer of 1955, Ngo Dinh Diem, under the guise of the so-called "Accusation of Communists," tried his best to undermine the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the protection of the people's democratic rights, and intensified the retaliation and suppression of former resistance personnel and the broad masses of people who supported peace and unification. At the same time, Ngo Dinh Diem, in collaboration with Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang special agents, used the same pretext to intensify the persecution and exclusion of Overseas Chinese. According to news from South Vietnam: From last October to now, many Overseas Chinese have been unreasonably arrested, imprisoned, or sent to Taiwan by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. There are also quite a few Overseas Chinese shops whose property has been sealed and infringed upon by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique on trumped-up charges. The following facts have been publicly revealed in Saigon newspapers: On October 28 last year, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique suddenly arrested 15 Overseas Chinese in Cholon, including Mai Dinh, Yang Guang, Yang Zongshan, Sheng Quan, Yang Kun, Wu Huarong, Luo Yigang, Chen Youchun, Zhang Yaoji, Tan Suen, Huang Nan, Wu Niu, Lin Bingyou, Su Jiu, and Liang Hezhi, simply because they had discussed helping a teacher solve his financial difficulties. Mai Rong, a well-known Overseas Chinese doctor who was arrested at the same time as Mai Dinh and others, has already died in prison because he could not bear the persecution of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. On October 22, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique forcibly closed 7 Overseas Chinese shops in Cholon, and then its propaganda machine, the "Yanlun Bao" and other newspapers, vigorously "publicized" and strongly advocated further infringement of the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese, persecution of Overseas Chinese personal safety, and exclusion of the Overseas Chinese economy. On December 12, Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang special agents established the so-called "Overseas Chinese Accusation of the Communist Movement Committee" in Cholon. They cooperated with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to organize the so-called "Accusation of the Communist Week" on December 23, forcing each Overseas Chinese household to send a representative to participate, otherwise they would be arrested under the name of "colluding with the Viet Minh" and "colluding with the Communists." Many Overseas Chinese have been persecuted for refusing or avoiding participation in this kind of activity, and some have even been sent to Taiwan. Among the Overseas Chinese who have recently been unreasonably arrested by Ngo Dinh Diem, those whose names are already known include Hu Luhong, Zhong Meirong, Peng Nianli, Hu Jing, Li Subing, Lu Ruilan, Li Huihui, Li Zhenya, Ye Congying, Cai Shijin, Chen Jinda, Deng Nan, Ren Chunren, and Ye Ban, among others.

    The actions of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents in colluding to persecute and exclude Overseas Chinese have aroused boundless anger among the Overseas Chinese in Vietnam. The Overseas Chinese in South Vietnam are fighting to protect their legitimate rights and interests against the American imperialist lackey Ngo Dinh Diem clique and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, resolutely opposing their persecution and exclusion of Overseas Chinese under the pretext of the so-called "Movement to Accuse the Communists," and actively demanding the release of innocent arrested compatriots and the withdrawal of orders to close down shops. The criminal acts of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in violating the Geneva Accords and violating the people's democratic freedom rights will inevitably meet with final failure under the opposition of the Vietnamese people and the Overseas Chinese masses.

    吴庭艳集团和蒋介石匪帮特务互相勾结
    加紧迫害和排挤南越的华侨
    本报驻越南记者报道：吴庭艳集团和蒋介石匪帮特务互相勾结，以所谓“控诉共产党运动”作幌子，正在越南南方加紧迫害和排挤华侨。
    远在1954年7月，当吴庭艳在美帝国主义支持下登台的那天起，它就在对越南人民实施恐怖镇压政策的同时，开始侵犯华侨的正当权益。1955年春，吴庭艳和平川等教派武装进行战争，使西贡、堤岸等城市遭受严重破坏，成千座房屋或被炮弹炸塌或被大火烧毁，上万群众无家可归流离失所，其中尤以华侨的损失最大，因为进行战争的地方正是华侨最集中的区域。战事过后，吴庭艳又严禁进行救济活动，许多越南人民和华侨因为救济了受灾区群众而被捕。从1955年夏天开始，吴庭艳更在所谓“控诉共产党”的幌子掩盖下，极力破坏日内瓦协议关于保障人民民主权利的规定，加紧对前抗战人员和广大的赞成和平赞成统一的人民群众进行报复和镇压；同时，吴庭艳并在蒋介石匪帮特务的协同下，以同样的借口变本加厉地迫害和排挤华侨。据从南越传来的消息：自去年10月到现在，被吴庭艳集团无理逮捕横加监禁或送往台湾的华侨已有许多人，被吴庭艳集团以莫须有的罪名查封侵犯财产的华侨商店也不在少数。仅在西贡报纸上公开透露的就有以下这一些事实：去年10月28日，吴庭艳集团在堤岸市突然逮捕麦丁、杨光、杨宗善、升权、杨坤、吴华荣、罗艺刚、陈友春、张耀基、谭素恩、黄南、吴牛、林炳酉、苏九、梁河志等15名华侨，原因仅仅因为他们曾经在一起商议帮助一位教师解决生活困难。和麦丁等同时被捕的，还有一位知名的华侨医生——麦容，因为不堪吴庭艳集团的迫害，已经死在狱中了。10月22日，吴庭艳集团强行封闭堤岸市7家华侨商店，随后它的宣传机器“言论报”等便大肆“宣传”，极力主张进一步侵犯华侨正当权益、迫害华侨人身和排挤华侨经济。12月12日，蒋介石匪帮特务更在堤岸市成立了所谓“华侨控诉共产党运动委员会”，它们和吴庭艳集团配合在12月23日组织所谓“控诉共产党周”，强迫华侨每户必须派一代表参加，否则就以“勾结越盟”、“勾结共产党”为名加以逮捕。许多华侨因为拒绝或逃避参加这种活动而遭到迫害，有的甚至被押送到台湾去。最近被吴庭艳无理的逮捕的华侨中，已经知道姓名的有胡露红、钟美容、彭年理、胡景、李素炳、卢瑞兰、李慧辉、李振亚、叶葱英、蔡世金、陈金大、邓南、任纯仁、叶班等人。
    吴庭艳集团和蒋介石匪特互相勾结迫害和排挤华侨的行动，已经激起了旅越华侨无比的愤怒。越南南方华侨正为着保卫自己的正当权益，向美帝国主义的走狗吴庭艳集团和蒋介石匪帮进行斗争，坚决反对它们在所谓“控诉共产党运动”的借口下迫害和排挤华侨，积极要求释放无辜被捕的侨胞和撤销对被封闭的商店指令。吴庭艳集团和蒋介石匪帮破坏日内瓦协定违犯人民民主自由权利的罪恶行为，必将在越南人民和华侨群众的反对下遭到最后的失败。（展潮）
