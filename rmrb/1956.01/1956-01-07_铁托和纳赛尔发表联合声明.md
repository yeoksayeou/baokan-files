Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 6th: According to a Yugoslav news agency report from Cairo: Yugoslav President Tito and Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser issued a joint statement on the 5th. The joint statement said that they exchanged views on the international situation, including the issues of Southern Europe and the Near East, and discussed further developing and consolidating relations and cooperation between the two countries.

The joint statement said: President Tito and Prime Minister Nasser noted with satisfaction that their opinions on the fundamental issues of the current international situation are consistent. They believe that the general danger of war has decreased, and the overall situation has improved. However, the influence of the "Cold War" still exists, which inevitably hinders the general trend towards relaxation of the situation.

The joint statement said: They believe that world problems should be resolved in a new and constructive way. First, there are issues such as accelerating the consolidation of the independence of countries that have recently gained sovereignty, accelerating the attainment of sovereignty for countries that are not yet independent, and developing the economies of backward countries. These issues must be resolved in accordance with the United Nations Charter, on the basis of complete equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

In the statement, the two politicians reiterated that Yugoslavia and Egypt continue to adhere to a policy of non-alignment with any bloc. They believe that the purpose of this policy is to achieve universal collective security and greatly expand the world's peaceful areas. The policy of establishing military blocs and concluding military treaties inevitably leads to an arms race and exacerbates world tensions. They expressed their belief that cooperation between countries on the basis of independence and complete equality can consolidate peace, and unanimously agreed that the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference embody these principles.

The statement welcomed the United Nations decision to admit 16 member states. The statement also touched on issues such as arms reduction and the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

The joint statement said that the two leaders noted with satisfaction the increasing closeness and consolidation of cooperative relations between the two countries, and expressed their determination to continue to develop relations between the two countries in political, economic, cultural and other fields on the basis of mutual respect, mutual benefit, and never interfering in each other's internal affairs.

　　铁托和纳赛尔发表联合声明
    新华社6日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社开罗消息：南斯拉夫总统铁托和埃及总理纳赛尔在5日发表了一项联合声明。联合声明说，他们就国际局势，包括南欧和近东的问题交换了意见，并且讨论了进一步发展和巩固两国关系和合作的问题。
    联合声明说：铁托总统和纳赛尔总理满意地指出，他们对当前国际局势根本问题的意见是一致的。他们认为，战争的普遍危险已经减少，总的形势有了好转。但是，“冷战”的影响仍然存在，这必然阻碍走向局势缓和的总的趋势。
    联合声明说：他们认为应该以新的建设性的方式来解决世界问题。首先是加速使最近获得主权的国家的独立得以巩固，加速使还没有独立的国家获得主权，使落后国家的经济得以发展这样一些问题。这些问题必须遵照联合国宪章，在完全平等和不干涉其他国家的内政的基础上得到解决。
    两位政治家在声明中重申，南斯拉夫和埃及两国继续坚持奉行不参加任何集团的政策。他们认为，这种政策的目的是实现普遍的集体安全和大大地扩大世界和平地区。实行建立军事集团和缔结军事条约的政策不可避免地会造成军备竞赛，加剧世界紧张局势。他们表示相信各国在独立和完全平等的基础上进行合作可以巩固和平，并且一致认为，亚非会议的决议体现了这些原则。
    声明欢迎联合国关于接纳16个会员国的决定。声明还谈到了裁减军备以及把核子能用于和平目的等问题。
    联合声明说，两位领袖满意地注意到两国合作关系的日益密切和巩固，并且表示决心继续在相互尊重、互利和永远不干涉彼此的内政的基础上发展两国在政治、经济、文化和其他方面的关系。
