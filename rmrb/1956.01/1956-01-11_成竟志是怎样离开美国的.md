Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Even after the United States undertook the solemn obligation in Geneva on September 10, 1955, to allow Chinese civilians to leave the United States freely and without obstruction, Chinese student Cheng Jingzhi and his family had to leave the United States under deportation proceedings.
	A Xinhua News Agency reporter interviewed Cheng Jingzhi today. He is a 35-year-old architectural engineer. In 1947, he obtained a master's degree from Columbia University in the United States. He only returned to his motherland last December with his wife and two children, after being away for ten years.
	Cheng Jingzhi's return to China fully proves that the U.S. State Department's statement on December 16, claiming that Chinese people in the United States "can leave now and at any time in the past," is not factual.
	Cheng Jingzhi said that he had requested the U.S. government authorities to allow him to return to China as early as 1950. On that occasion, the Immigration Bureau interrogated him repeatedly for more than six hours and threatened him that if he insisted on returning to China, he would be fined $5,000 or sentenced to two years in prison.
	In this hopeless situation, Cheng Jingzhi had no choice but to request the Immigration Bureau to deport him, thinking that this might achieve the goal of returning to his motherland. The Immigration Bureau indeed sentenced him to deportation, but at the same time, it placed him under strict control under the guise of a suspended sentence.
	In addition, Cheng Jingzhi, like other Chinese in the United States, was tormented by U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents everywhere. On one occasion, U.S. agents even asked him to inform on and frame other Chinese people.
	Cheng Jingzhi then narrated the recent return to China: "A few days before we left Miami, Florida, on September 14 last year, we went to the Immigration Bureau to complete the procedures for returning to China. The people at the Immigration Bureau didn't mention the Geneva Agreement at all, as if they had never heard of it.
	"Not only that, but they also talked to us for a full three hours, intending to persuade us to change our minds and live in the United States for a long time. Although they had been monitoring us for five years and knew everything about us, they still asked us in detail why we wanted to leave the United States. In fact, since we applied to return to China in 1950, they have not relaxed their grip on us for a single day."
	Finally, the Immigration Bureau officials told Cheng Jingzhi that if he insisted on leaving, then he would be deported or leave the United States under deportation proceedings.
	"I thought that as long as I could leave the United States, even if it was under deportation proceedings, it would be a step forward compared to 1950!" Cheng Jingzhi said.
	However, the Immigration Bureau's difficulties did not end there. When Cheng Jingzhi passed through Honolulu on his way back to China, an Immigration Bureau official went to him and took back a document he was carrying that sentenced him to leave under deportation proceedings. Cheng Jingzhi said, "I think they just didn't want us to keep this piece of evidence that's why they took it back."
	Cheng Jingzhi finally said to the reporter: "Although I have returned to my motherland, I am still thinking about my colleagues and friends in the United States, those ordinary Americans who were very kind and friendly to us. When they heard that we were leaving, they extended their kind regards to us, and some even gave us a warm send-off. I am now only afraid that they will be persecuted by the U.S. authorities. In addition, if the news about my experience can help other Chinese in the United States find a way to return to China, then I would be very happy."

    成竟志是怎样离开美国的
    新华社10日讯　就在1955年9月10日美国在日内瓦承担了允许中国平民自由无阻地离开美国的庄严义务之后，中国留学生成竟志一家还不得不在驱逐出境的程序下离开美国。
    新华社记者今天访问了成竟志，他是一位35岁的建筑工程师。1947年他在美国哥伦比亚大学获得硕士学位；去年12月才带着妻子和两个小孩回到阔别十年的祖国来。
    成竟志回国的经过充分证明了，美国国务院12月16日发表的，说什么在美国的中国人“现在和过去任何时候”要走都可以走的声明是不合乎事实的。
    成竟志说，他早在1950年就请求美国政府当局允许他回国。那一次移民局把他反复讯问了六个多小时，并且恫吓他说，假如他坚持要回国的话，就要被处以五千美元的罚款或者两年的徒刑。
    在这种走头无路的情况下，成竟志不得已而请求移民局把他驱逐出境，以为这样也许可以达到返回祖国的目的。移民局果然判他以驱逐出境的处分，但同时却利用缓期执行的名义，把他置于严格的控制之下。
    除此以外，成竟志还同其他在美国的中国人一样，到处受到美国联邦调查局特务的折磨。有一次，美国特务甚至要他报密以陷害其他中国人。
    成竟志接着叙述了最近回国的经过：“去年9月14日，我们离开美国佛罗里达州迈阿密城的前几天，我们曾到移民局去办理回国手续。移民局的人员对日内瓦协议只字不提，好像从来没有听说过这件事一样。
    “不但这样，他们还跟我们足足谈了三个钟头的话，打算叫我们改变主意，在美国长期住下去。虽然他们已经把我们监视了五年，对我们的事情知道的一清二楚，他们还是盘根诘底，问我们为什么要离开美国。事实上，从1950年我们申请回国以来，他们就没有一天放松过我们。”
    最后，移民局的人员对成竟志说，假如他一定要走，那么他就要被驱逐出境或者在驱逐出境的程序下离开美国。
    “我想只要能够离开美国，那怕就是在驱逐出境的程序下走掉，也算是比1950年进了一步吧！”成竟志说。
    但是，移民局的刁难还没有就此结束。成竟志回国途中经过檀香山的时候，还有一个移民局的官员去找他，把他随身带着的一份判他在驱逐出境的程序下离境的文件收回。成竟志说，“我想他们总是不愿意我们保留这件证据才收回去的吧。”
    成竟志最后对记者说：“我现在虽然已经回到了祖国，不过总还是惦念着在美国的同事和朋友，那些对我们很亲切友善的普通美国人。他们听说我们要走的时候都向我们亲切致意，有些还为我们热烈饯行。我现在就是唯恐他们会受到美国当局的迫害。此外，假如关于我这段经历的消息能有助于其他在美国的中国人找到一条回国的道路，那我就很高兴了。”
