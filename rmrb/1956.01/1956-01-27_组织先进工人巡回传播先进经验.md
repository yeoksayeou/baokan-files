Organize Advanced Workers to Tour and Disseminate Advanced Experiences
Kailuan Mining Area Trade Union Production Department

The Kailuan Coal Mine organized advanced workers to tour and disseminate advanced experiences, which achieved very good results.

The Kailuan Coal Mine failed to complete its production tasks from January to September last year. To complete this task, every worker needed to make great efforts. In October, new unified norms for mining and tunneling operations were implemented, which were approximately 26% higher than the old norms. Under these circumstances, if workers were not assisted in improving their skills to meet and exceed the new norms, it would be impossible to complete the annual production task.

Therefore, the Kailuan Coal Mine Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requested the trade union to widely and deeply organize the masses of workers to participate in labor competitions, promote advanced experiences, and specifically help workers improve their skills and break through norms. After studying the Party Committee's instructions, the trade union believed that to change the past formalistic labor competitions, it was necessary to start by understanding the situation, identifying the key problems in production, and then proposing solutions. After investigation, it was found that there were significant differences in the technical level of workers in various coal mining faces throughout the mine. Even in the same type of work and under the same conditions, production efficiency varied greatly. For example, in the work of moving electric skids in coal mining faces, some had already reached 52.4 meters per shift, while others only reached 16.67 meters per shift; in terms of pit wood recovery, some had reached over 95%, while others only reached 23%. Similar situations existed in other types of work. This situation indicated that if the laggards could be gradually brought up to the level of the advanced, efficiency could be greatly improved, and the completion of the task could be guaranteed.

From October of last year, the Kailuan Coal Mine General Management Office and the Kailuan Mining Area Trade Union, under the leadership of the Party Committee, began to promote advanced experiences. The main method was to organize advanced workers to tour and impart experiences to various mines. In more than two months, a total of 151 discussion meetings were held, and 58 on-site operation demonstrations were conducted, successively promoting 10 types of advanced operating experiences, such as single-person props, single-person electric drills for recovery, and slit-shaped slotting for tunneling. By mid-December, 75% of the recovery faces and more than 20% of the tunneling faces in the entire mine had adopted these experiences. The number of people who learned new operating methods accounted for 7.3% of these types of work, among which 608 people had reached advanced levels, and 85 "little teachers" were trained. In the process of promoting advanced experiences, some workers and technicians humbly studied and worked hard to improve operating methods, and some advanced experiences were further developed. For example, a prop removal worker in a face of Zhaogezhuang Mine, with the help of an engineer, developed a method of using six rope ends for prop removal, which increased the recovery rate of pit wood from 24% in the past to 90%. Zhang He, an advanced worker from Linxi Mine who disseminated the advanced method of winch prop removal, further improved the efficiency of prop removal by integrating the operational advantages of various units through touring performances, exceeding the norm by more than one time.

After the promotion of advanced experiences, the labor efficiency of workers in various types of work generally increased by 20% to 60%, saving 342 labor forces, reducing costs, increasing worker income, and ensuring the completion of the task. Since October, the entire mine has overfulfilled its production tasks every month. Zhaogezhuang Mine's 7/1 Coal Mining District failed to complete its tasks from January to September. After starting to promote advanced experiences in October, even after transferring 24 workers, it still comprehensively overfulfilled its production tasks.

    组织先进工人巡回传播先进经验
    开滦矿区工会生产部
    开滦煤矿组织先进工人巡回传播先进经验，收到了很好的效果。
    开滦煤矿去年1至9月都没有完成生产任务。要完成这个任务，需要每个工人都做很大的努力。而10月份又实行新的采掘工作统一定额，比旧的定额约提高了26％多。在这种情况下，如果不帮助工人们提高技术，达到和突破新的定额，就不可能完成全年的生产任务。
    于是中共开滦煤矿委员会便向工会提出了要求：广泛深入地组织工人群众参加劳动竞赛，推广先进经验，具体帮助工人提高技术，突破定额。工会研究了党委的指示后，认为要改变过去那种形式主义的劳动竞赛，就必须从了解情况入手，发现生产中的关键问题，然后再提出解决的办法。经过调查，发现全矿各采煤掌子工人的技术水平有很大的差别。同一工种在同样的条件下，生产效率相差很多。比如，在采煤掌子移电溜这一工作中，有的每工已经达52.4公尺，有的每工才只16.67公尺；在坑木回收方面，有的已经达95％以上，有的只达23％。其他工种也有类似情况。这个情况表明，如果能够把落后者逐步提高到先进者的水平，就可以大大提高效率，保证完成任务。
    从去年10月份起，开滦煤矿总管理处和开滦矿区工会便在党委的领导下，开始了推广先进经验的工作。主要的方法就是组织先进工人到各矿去巡回传授经验。在两个多月中，共召开了151次座谈会，进行了58次实地操作表演，先后推广了回采的单人支柱、单人电钻和掘进缝形掏槽等10种先进操作经验。到12月中旬，全矿已经有75％的回采掌子和20％以上的掘进掌子推广了这些经验。学会新操作方法的人数，已经占这些工种的7.3％，其中达到先进水平的已经有608人，培养出小先生85人。在推广先进经验的过程中，由于一些工人和技术人员虚心钻研，努力改进操作方法，一些先进经验得到了进一步的发展。例如，赵各庄矿一个掌子的回柱工人在工程师的帮助下，研究出了使用六绳头回柱的方法，使坑木的回收率由过去的24％提高到90％。林西矿传播绞车回柱的先进工人张和，通过巡回表演综合了各单位的操作优点，进一步提高了回柱效率，突破定额达一倍以上。
    在推广先进经验以后，各工种工人的劳动效率一般提高了20％到60％，节省了342个劳动力，降低了成本，增加了工人收入，也保证了任务的完成。自10月份起，全矿每月都超额完成了生产任务。赵各庄矿七一采煤区1至9月都没有完成任务，10月份开始推广先进经验后，在抽调了24个工人的条件下，还全面地超额完成了生产任务。
