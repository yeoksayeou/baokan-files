    Shandong Province Develops Rural Broadcasting Stations
    Shandong Province has established radio stations in more than 850 agricultural producers' cooperatives. The radios used are provided by the state free of charge. Members have raised their awareness and learned a lot of production knowledge from listening to the broadcasts. The "August 1st" Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Gaotunzhuang, Huimin County, has listened to nearly 100 broadcasts in just over a month since establishing a radio station, with more than 2,000 listeners. This cooperative studied and adopted the method of feeding pigs with substitute foods introduced on the radio, which can save more than 330 yuan worth of feed each month. After listening to the broadcasts about the "Three Fixes" policy, the members of the Guo Hai Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Guanchao County increased their enthusiasm for production, and the whole cooperative plowed more than 60 mu of land in three days. Many farmers also frequently go to the radio station to inquire about weather changes.
    At present, Shandong Province has newly built rural wired broadcasting stations in 12 counties, with more than 4,000 loudspeakers. Broadcasting officially began on New Year's Day, 1956.

    山东省发展农村广播站
    山东省已在850多个农业生产合作社里建立了收音站，所用收音机都是国家无偿发给的。社员们从听广播中提高了觉悟，学会了许多生产知识。惠民县高屯庄“八一”农业生产合作社建立收音站的一个多月中就收听了近百次，听众有二千多人次。这个社研究采用了广播里介绍的用代食品喂猪的办法，每月可节省价值330多元的饲料。观朝县郭海村农业生产合作社社员们收听了有关“三定”政策的广播后，提高了生产热情，全社三天就翻地60多亩。许多农民还经常到收音站询问天气变化的消息。
    目前山东省又在12个县新建了农村有线广播站，有广播喇叭四千多个，1956年元旦正式开始广播。
