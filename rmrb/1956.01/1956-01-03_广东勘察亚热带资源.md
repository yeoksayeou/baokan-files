    Guangdong Surveying Subtropical Resources
    The Guangdong Subtropical Resources Development Committee recently dispatched a survey and planning team to Hainan Island for on-site surveys. The survey and planning team consists of more than 200 people, and experts and technical personnel from relevant central departments have also participated. After the planning work for the development of Hainan Island resources is completed at the end of April 1956, the survey and planning team will conduct surveys in the Leizhou Peninsula and Qinzhou area. It is expected that before the end of 1956, specific plans for the development of subtropical resources in Guangdong during the country's second five-year plan period and long-term plans for transforming the subtropical natural environment of Guangdong can be determined.
    Hainan Island, the Leizhou Peninsula, and the Qinzhou area have high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year, making them suitable for planting more than 20 kinds of industrial crops with high economic value such as rubber, sisal hemp, coconut, and coffee. According to research and statistics by more than 50 experts, there are approximately 12 million mu of wasteland in these three regions that can be developed to plant the aforementioned crops. In addition, these areas also have abundant fishery, mineral, and primeval forest resources. In order to extensively promote the planting of subtropical crops, the Guangdong Provincial Agriculture, Reclamation, and Experimental Research Departments are establishing comprehensive seed and seedling bases in the aforementioned areas, and are starting to establish various tropical crop trial planting stations, experimental stations, and technical promotion stations. Recently, the state also allocated one million yuan in special funds as funding for tropical crop seed and seedling propagation.

    广东勘察亚热带资源
    广东省亚热带资源开发委员会最近派出一个勘察规划队前往海南岛进行实地勘察。这个勘察规划队共有二百多人，中央各有关部门也派了专家和技术人员参加。1956年4月底，开发海南岛资源的规划工作结束以后，这个勘察规划队就要到雷州半岛和钦州地区进行勘察。预计1956年年底以前，可以定出国家第二个五年计划期间开发广东亚热带资源的具体计划和改造广东亚热带自然面貌的远景计划。
    海南岛、雷州半岛和钦州地区，全年高温多雨，适宜种植橡胶、剑麻、椰子、咖啡等20多种经济价值很高的技术作物。据50多名专家的研究统计，这三个地区可以开发种植上述作物的荒地约有1，200万亩。另外，这些地区还有很丰富的渔产、矿产和原始森林。为了大量推广种植亚热带作物，广东省农业、垦殖、试验研究等部门正在上述地区分别建立综合性的种苗基地，并且着手成立多种热带作物的试种站、试验站和技术推广站。最近，国家还拨出一百万元的专用款，作为热带作物种苗繁殖的资金。
