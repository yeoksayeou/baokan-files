Eradicating illiteracy in rural areas during the agricultural cooperativization movement is both necessary and achievable in Xinjiang, a region with many ethnic minorities.

Young people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are eager to learn culture because, like young people across the country, they have grand aspirations to build socialism. They need to become cultured people and, together with the people of the whole country, exert greater strength in the great construction cause of our motherland. In the 6 years since liberation, young people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have actively studied culture, and about 100,000 young people have already emerged from illiteracy.

Based on the actual situation in Xinjiang, we aim to basically eliminate illiteracy among Xinjiang youth within 5 years. What favorable conditions do we have? In addition to the Party's attention and care, and the high learning enthusiasm of the vast number of young people, the writing systems of various ethnic minorities in Xinjiang are phonetic. There are many vivid examples of this. For example, in Yutian and Toksun counties, the number of people who entered winter schools in 1954 was 5,116. After a winter of study, 949 people reached the level of non-illiteracy (some of whom were originally semi-literate), and 1,770 people reached the level of semi-literacy, accounting for 34.5% of the number of people participating in winter schools. According to surveys, semi-literate people and those who study hard can reach the level of non-illiteracy in just two months, while fully illiterate people and those who do not study hard can become semi-literate after 4 months of study. The phonetic writing systems of various ethnic minorities in Xinjiang are not only quick for general young people to learn, but even busy township cadres can completely get rid of illiteracy after working hard for about half a year. Dawuti, the secretary of the Party branch of Tuanjie Township in Turpan, and Heiyar, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, were able to take notes and read newspapers after attending winter school for two months in 1952 and then working with county and district cadres for more than two months. The above is the situation in agricultural areas. There are also many such examples in pastoral areas: In two pastoral areas of Hutubi County, 85 literacy groups were organized in 1954, with a total of 880 participants. After 3 months and 10 days of study, 760 people reached the level of non-illiteracy (including 337 who were originally semi-literate), accounting for 86.3% of all participants. In addition, Xinjiang has a long agricultural off-season, with ample time to carry out illiteracy eradication work. Moreover, there are 150,000 educated young people (including graduates of primary and secondary schools and young people who have emerged from illiteracy) in the rural areas of Xinjiang who can serve as a force for illiteracy eradication. In pastoral areas, almost every township has a primary school, and there is also a group of educated young people who can help with illiteracy eradication work. All of these are favorable conditions for illiteracy eradication work in Xinjiang. Under the leadership of the Party, we must make full use of these favorable conditions and actively carry out illiteracy eradication work.

    在5年内扫除新疆农村中的青年文盲
    青年团新疆维吾尔自治区委员会书记　牛其益
    在农业合作化运动过程中扫除农村的文盲，这在少数民族地区的新疆也是非常必要和有条件办到的。
    新疆各族青年迫切要求学习文化，因为新疆各族青年和全国青年一样，都有建设社会主义的宏大志愿。他们需要使自己成为有文化的人，和全国人民一道，在我们祖国的伟大建设事业中，发挥更大的力量。解放6年来，新疆各族青年积极学习文化，并且已经有10万左右的青年脱离文盲状态。
    从新疆的实际情况出发，我们要在5年之内基本上扫除新疆青年的文盲。这有些什么有利条件呢？除了党的重视和关怀、广大青年有高涨的学习热情等有利条件以外，这就是新疆各少数民族的文字是拼音文字。这里有许多活生生的事实。如于阗、托克逊县1954年入冬学的人数是5，116人，经过一个冬季的学习，就有949人达到了非文盲程度（其中有些原来是半文盲），有1，770人达到半文盲程度，占参加冬学人数的34.5％。根据调查，半文盲和努力学习的人，只要两个月就可以达到非文盲程度，全文盲和不太努力学习的人，经过4个月的学习也可以变为半文盲。新疆各少数民族的拼音文字不只是一般青年学习快，就连工作很忙的乡干部只要努力学习半年左右，也完全可以脱离文盲状态。吐鲁番团结乡党支部书记达吾提和团支部书记黑牙尔，1952年上了两个月冬学，以后又和县、区干部一起工作了两个多月，就能记笔记和看报纸了。以上是农业区的情况。在牧区也有许多这样的例子：呼图壁县的两个牧区，1954年组织85个识字组，参加的人共880人，经过3个月零10天的学习，有760人达到非文盲程度（其中有337人原为半文盲），占全部参加者的86.3％。此外，新疆农闲时间较长，有充裕的时间去进行扫除文盲工作，并且在新疆的农村有15万知识青年（包括中小学毕业生和脱离文盲状态的青年）可以作为扫除文盲的力量；在牧区，差不多乡乡有小学，也有一批知识青年可以帮助进行扫除文盲工作。这一切都是新疆扫除文盲工作的有利条件。我们要在党的领导下，充分利用这些有利条件，积极地开展扫除文盲工作。
