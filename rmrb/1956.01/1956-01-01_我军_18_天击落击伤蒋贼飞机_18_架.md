Xinhua News Agency, 30th: Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's land, sea, and air forces have continuously harassed, sabotaged, and provoked along the southeastern coast of the mainland.

Chiang Kai-shek's air force planes have been frequently conducting reconnaissance, strafing, and bombing activities in the southeastern coastal areas of the mainland. From December 13th to 29th, 105 batches, totaling 347 sorties, of Chiang Kai-shek's planes intruded into the southeastern coastal areas. On the 13th, 16th, 22nd, and 28th, US-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft intruded into areas such as Dongshan Island, Sandu'ao, Shacheng, and Shantou, strafing and bombing fishing boats, merchant ships, and coastal villages. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek's air force planes also continuously conducted various military exercises on Jinmen (Quemoy) and Mazu (Matsu) Islands. The Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the anti-aircraft artillery units stationed on the coastal defense front dealt a heavy blow to the intruding Chiang Kai-shek aircraft. From the 13th to the 28th, the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the coastal defense front anti-aircraft artillery units shot down and damaged a total of 15 Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, including five shot down.

In recent days, Chiang Kai-shek's naval vessels have also been frequently active in the southeastern waters of the mainland, intercepting merchant ships and fishing boats, and killing fishermen. On the 28th, 11 Chiang Kai-shek naval vessels gathered near Mazu Island, attempting to make trouble. These Chiang Kai-shek naval vessels included gunboats and landing transport ships. Chiang Kai-shek's artillery, entrenched on Jinmen Island, has also been continuously shelling villages and towns in areas such as Xiamen, destroying many civilian houses.

This series of harassing and sabotage activities by Chiang Kai-shek's land, sea, and air forces in the southeastern coastal areas of the mainland proves that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is stepping up the creation of tension in the Far East.

Xinhua News Agency, 31st: In the two days of the 29th and 30th, the anti-aircraft artillery units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front shot down one and damaged two Chiang Kai-shek aircraft.

At 12:29 on the 29th, a batch of two US-made Chiang Kai-shek F-84 fighter planes intruded into the Dongshan Island area. Our frontline anti-aircraft artillery units hit one of them. This Chiang Kai-shek aircraft crashed into the sea near the Southeast Brothers Islands of Dongshan Island.

At 7:00 and 17:52 on the 30th, a total of two Chiang Kai-shek AT-6 aircraft intruded into the airspace over Daxiaodeng Island and the Xiamen area. Our frontline anti-aircraft artillery units immediately intercepted the enemy aircraft with fierce artillery fire. Both Chiang Kai-shek aircraft were damaged one after the other.
