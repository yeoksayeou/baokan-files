Title: Selecting Accountants Shouldn't Be Careless Either

Longjin District in Anyi County, Jiangxi Province, established 76 agricultural cooperatives in the second half of last year. Because the District Committee and the various township branches had an incorrect understanding: "The selection of cooperative directors should be taken seriously, but it doesn't matter if the accountant is a bit careless," 34% of the cooperative accountants were upper-middle peasant members. Most of these accountants were passive and lazy in their work, and some even abused their power for personal gain. Cai Zhilong, the accountant of the Shanshan Cooperative in Taishan Township, did not properly handle the loan procedures for other poor peasant members because he himself could not use the poor peasant cooperative fund loan. Xiong Mu'en, the accountant of the Loubei Cooperative in Tianbu Township, over-reported the population and underpaid public grain.

The experience of Longjin District tells us that the Party's class line in the cooperativization movement must be implemented in all aspects. If any aspect neglects this point, more problems will occur in that aspect of the work. This is a theorem.

    选拔会计也不该马虎
    江西省安义县龙津区在去年下半年建立了76个农业合作社，由于这个区的区委会和各个乡支部有一种不正确的认识：“社长应该认真选拔，会计马虎一点没啥”，因而有34％的合作社会计都是上中农社员。这些会计大多消极怠工，有的甚至利用职权，假公济私。台山乡山下合作社的会计蔡之龙，由于自己不能使用贫农合作基金贷款，就不好好替别的贫农社员办理领款手续。田埠乡楼北合作社的会计熊沐恩，多报人口，少缴公粮。
    龙津区的经验告诉我们：党在合作化运动中的阶级路线，必须贯串在各个方面，哪一方面忽略了这一点，哪一方面的工作就会发生更多的问题。这是一条定理。
