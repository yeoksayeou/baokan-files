Mutual Learning and Common Improvement
    ——Main Experiences of Inter-Factory Competition Among Three Bicycle Factories
    Kang Yonghe, Chairman of the National Committee of the First Machine Industry Trade Union

    The Tianjin, Shanghai, and Shenyang bicycle factories, under the First Ministry of Machine Building, belonged to the same owner during the period of Japanese and puppet rule. The products were the same, and the equipment and scale were similar. After liberation, the three factories underwent continuous reforms, and their production levels improved. The equipment of the Shenyang factory was rebuilt and was better than that of the other two factories. However, the degree of progress in these factories varied greatly. For example, the Shenyang factory's planned bicycle production last year was equivalent to 44.7% of Tianjin's planned output and 41.4% of Shanghai's. The labor productivity in the first quarter of last year was 53.8% lower than Tianjin's and 52.2% lower than Shanghai's. The cost per bicycle was over 79 yuan in Tianjin, over 88 yuan in Shanghai, but as high as 110 yuan in Shenyang. In terms of quality, in the first quarter of last year, the Shenyang factory had to rework 14,000 bicycles due to poor product quality, resulting in significant losses and nearly forcing the factory to close.

    In response to this situation, when the First Machine Industry Trade Union arranged last year's tasks for the First Machine Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, it suggested that these three factories carry out inter-factory competitions. This suggestion was unanimously approved after discussion by the Party Committee Secretaries, Factory Directors, and Trade Union Chairmen of the three factories. They decided to focus the competition on improving product quality and reducing product costs, with improving the four main processes of electroplating, painting, welding, and heat treatment as key to improving product quality. The competition started in April. During the more than half-year-long competition, each factory made significant progress. The Shenyang Bicycle Factory made rapid progress in the three main processes of electroplating, painting, and welding, all reaching the level of advanced factories. The "Baishan" brand bicycles produced by this factory surpassed the "Flying Pigeon" brand from Tianjin and the "Forever" brand from Shanghai in many aspects of quality. For example, using a spray method to check electroplated parts, Tianjin showed rust in 24 hours, while Shenyang showed no rust even after 48 hours. The Shanghai Bicycle Factory was originally a relatively conservative and backward unit among the state-owned machinery factories in Shanghai. Since participating in the competition, it has fully mobilized the masses, and its work has greatly changed. The achievements in increasing production and practicing economy have been remarkable. Last year, it won the mobile red flag in the summary of the third quarter's competition. Since the competition began, the Tianjin and Shanghai bicycle factories have overfulfilled their tasks every quarter. The Shenyang Bicycle Factory's completion of the state plan was not very good, but it improved after August last year, and costs also decreased month by month.

    The actual effectiveness of the inter-factory competition among these three factories shows that carrying out inter-factory competitions among factories with similar types, products, equipment, and technological processes is an effective way for backward enterprises to learn from advanced enterprises, advanced enterprises to help backward enterprises, and thus achieve common improvement. Because for each type of factory, who is advanced, who is backward, how big is the difference between advanced and backward, and how far is the distance, are all clearly displayed in front of the workers and masses of each factory through self-examination and mutual inspection during the competition process. This greatly stimulates the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers in each factory, especially in backward factories, to learn from and catch up with advanced factories. Moreover, the technological processes, production organization, and advanced experiences of advanced producers in factories of the same type and producing the same products can also be widely promoted.

    The reason why these three bicycle factories were able to improve together in the inter-factory competition is mainly because they grasped the important link of exchanging advanced experiences, so that the advanced led the backward, and the backward caught up with the advanced. In order to exchange advanced experiences, they adopted methods such as regularly exchanging brief reports on the conditions for achieving competition conditions, timely exchanging experiences in production technology, financial management, and mass work, mutual visits and inspections, holding product demonstrations and special forums, and sending technicians and workers to learn on-site; and convened a competition summary meeting attended by factory directors, branch secretaries, trade union chairmen, technical personnel from various departments, and advanced workers from each factory. At the meeting, the well-made bicycles from the three factories were exhibited for joint technical appraisal, affirming the advantages and identifying the shortcomings. At the special forums, the factory directors exchanged experiences in organizing assembly line production; the trade union chairmen discussed the issue of inter-factory competition being based on intra-factory competition. Advanced workers went deep into workshops, sections, and groups to exchange technical insights. At this meeting, the Shanghai factory learned 12 advanced experiences from Tianjin and two advanced experiences from Shenyang, and incorporated them into the organizational and technical measures plan for the third quarter. Although the Tianjin factory won the mobile red flag in the second quarter's summary, the electroplating quality of the Shenyang factory had significantly improved after equipment modification, far surpassing Tianjin's. The Tianjin factory formed a study group and went to the Shenyang factory to visit and learn. The Shanghai factory also organized study groups to go to the Tianjin and Shenyang factories to learn, and incorporated the various advanced experiences learned into the organizational and technical measures plans for the fourth quarter and 1956. The study groups from Tianjin and Shanghai not only learned from the advanced experiences of the Shenyang factory, but also put forward suggestions for improvement on the shortcomings in the work of the Shenyang factory, playing the role of "public inspection" for the Shenyang factory. In order to systematically learn the experiences of the other two factories, the Shenyang factory also organized study groups to go to the Tianjin and Shanghai factories to learn. As the activities of mutual learning were strengthened, the effect of the competition became more significant, and the enthusiasm of the workers also increased. Initially, the paint quality of the Tianjin factory was not good. After learning from the experience of the Shanghai factory and the local paint factory, the paint quality surpassed that of the Shanghai factory; the Shanghai factory then turned around and learned from the Tianjin factory. The paint quality of the Shenyang factory was originally the worst and the equipment was the worst, but after learning the paint mixing experience of the Shanghai factory and the circulating filtration experience of the Tianjin factory, and implementing the process regulations formulated by integrating the advantages of the three factories, the paint quality actually surpassed that of the other two factories; the other two factories then turned around and learned from the Shenyang factory. In this way, they repeatedly learned from each other and made continuous progress.

    After the three factories carried out the inter-factory competition, the leadership at all levels of the enterprises became closer to the workers and masses, and the work of the Party, the work of the trade union, and the administrative work were better combined.

    Although the inter-factory competition of these three bicycle factories achieved the above-mentioned results, due to the fact that the guiding ideology of our guidance of the competition was not clear enough, and the masses participating in the competition, first of all, some leaders, did not have a deep understanding of the significance and purpose of the competition, there were phenomena of mutual disagreement and of making false statements in order to obtain red flags and bonuses.

    In order to enable participants in the competition to truly exchange experiences and jointly improve production in the spirit of communism and with a comrade-like attitude, inter-factory competitions throughout the entire industry should be organized and carried out according to the following slogan: "Backward enterprises learn from advanced enterprises and catch up with advanced enterprises; advanced enterprises help backward enterprises to catch up with themselves, and at the same time strive to make themselves even more advanced. There are rewards for backward enterprises catching up with advanced enterprises, rewards for advanced enterprises helping backward enterprises to catch up with themselves, and even more rewards for making progress at the advanced level."

    互相学习，共同提高
    ——三个自行车厂厂际竞赛的主要经验
    第一机械工会全国委员会主席　康永和
    第一机械工业部所属的天津、上海和沈阳三个自行车厂，在日伪统治时期同属于一个老板，产品一样，设备、规模相仿。解放后，三个厂经过不断的改革，生产水平都有提高。沈阳厂的设备经过改建，比其他两个厂要好一些。但是，这几个厂进步的程度很悬殊，如沈阳厂去年计划生产的自行车，等于天津厂计划产量的44.7％，等于上海厂的41.4％；去年第一季度的劳动生产率比天津厂低53.8％，比上海厂低52.2％。每辆自行车的成本，天津厂是79元多，上海厂是88元多，而沈阳厂却高达110元。在质量方面，去年第一季度，沈阳厂曾因产品质量太坏，返修14，000辆，亏本不少，几乎关厂。
    针对这种情况，第一机械工会在第一机械工业部第一机器工业管理局布置去年任务的时候，建议这三个厂开展厂际竞赛。这一建议经过三个厂的党委书记、厂长、工会主席讨论以后，一致赞成，并且决定以提高产品质量、降低产品成本为竞赛的主要目标，以改进电镀、油漆、焊接、热处理四项主要工艺为提高产品质量的关键。竞赛从4月份开始。在半年多的竞赛过程中，各厂都有显著的进步。沈阳自行车厂在电镀、油漆和焊接三项主要工艺方面，进步很快，都达到了先进者的水平。这个厂出产的“白山牌”车子在质量方面有许多地方已经超过了天津厂的“飞鸽牌”和上海厂的“永久牌”车子。例如用喷雾方法检查电镀零件，天津的24小时见锈，沈阳的48小时仍不见锈。上海自行车厂原来在上海国营机械工厂中是一个比较保守落后的单位，参加竞赛以来，由于充分发动了群众，工作转变很大，增产节约的成绩很显著，去年在总结第三季度的竞赛时获得了流动红旗。自从竞赛以来，天津和上海的两个自行车厂季季超额完成任务。沈阳自行车厂完成国家计划还不算好，可是从去年8月份以后，有所好转，成本也逐月降低。
    这三个厂开展厂际竞赛的实际成效，说明在同类型、产品、设备、工艺过程近似的工厂之间开展厂际竞赛，是落后企业向先进企业学习，先进企业帮助落后企业，从而达到共同提高的一种有效办法。因为每一类型的工厂，谁先进，谁落后，先进和落后之间的差别多大，距离多远，经过竞赛过程中的自我检查和互相检查，都明显地摆在各厂职工群众的面前。这就大大地激发各厂、特别是落后厂广大职工群众学习和赶上先进厂的积极性。而且，同类型、同产品工厂的工艺技术过程、生产组织和先进生产者的先进经验，也可以广泛推广。
    这三个自行车厂在厂际竞赛中所以能够共同提高，主要是由于他们抓紧了交流先进经验这一重要环节，做到以先进带动落后，落后赶上先进。为了交流先进经验，他们采用了定期交换实现竞赛条件的简况，及时交换生产技术、财务管理、群众工作等方面的经验，相互参观和访问，举行产品观摩和专题座谈，派技术人员和工人到现场学习等办法；并且召开了包括各厂厂长、车间支部书记、工会主席、科室技术人员和先进工人等参加的竞赛总结会议，在会议中把三个厂做好的自行车展览出来，共同作技术鉴定，肯定优点，找出缺点。在专门的座谈会上，厂长们交换了组织流水作业生产线的经验；工会主席们座谈了厂际竞赛以厂内竞赛为基础的问题。先进工人们则深入车间、工段和小组，交换技术心得。上海厂就在这次会议中学习了天津厂12项先进经验和沈阳厂的两项先进经验，并且把它们纳入第三季度的组织技术措施计划内。天津厂第二季度总结中虽然获得流动红旗，但是沈阳厂的电镀质量在设备改装后有了显著的进步，远远超过天津厂；天津厂就组成学习小组，到沈阳厂去参观学习。上海厂也组织了学习小组到天津厂和沈阳厂去学习，并且把学习来的各项先进经验都纳入第四季度和1956年的组织技术措施计划内。天津厂和上海厂学习组不但学习了沈阳厂的先进经验，同时也对沈阳厂工作中的缺点提出改进的意见，对沈阳厂起了“公共检查”的作用。沈阳厂为了系统地学习其他两厂的经验，也组织了学习小组到天津、上海厂去学习。由于相互学习的活动加强了，竞赛的效果就更加显著，职工的热情也更加高涨起来。起初，天津厂的油漆质量不好，他们学习了上海厂和本市油漆厂的经验后，油漆质量超过了上海厂；上海厂又反过来向天津厂学习。沈阳厂的油漆质量本来最坏，设备最差，但是学习了上海厂配漆的经验和天津厂的循环过滤经验，执行了综合三个厂的优点而制定的工艺规程，油漆质量竟超过了其他两个厂；其他两个厂又反过来向沈阳厂学习。这样反复地互相学习，不断进步。
    这三个厂开展厂际竞赛以后，企业的各级领导人员更加接近了职工群众，党的工作、工会工作和行政工作结合得更好了。
    这三个自行车厂的厂际竞赛虽然取得了上述的成绩，但是由于我们指导竞赛的主导思想还不够明确，参加竞赛的群众，首先是一些领导人员对于竞赛的意义和目的还认识不深刻，在竞赛中曾产生过互不服气和为了获得红旗和奖金而弄虚作假的现象。
    为了使参加竞赛者能够真正做到以共产主义的精神和同志的态度，相互交流经验，共同把生产搞好，今后全产业范围的厂际竞赛，应该根据下面的口号来组织、开展。这个口号就是：“落后企业向先进企业学习，赶上先进企业，先进企业帮助落后企业赶上自己，同时力求自己更加进步。落后企业赶上先进企业有奖，先进企业帮助落后企业赶上自己者有奖，在先进水平上再有进步者更要奖。”
