Great progress has been made in the construction of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects and winter plowing to eliminate pests.

    江西省委号召开展水稻千斤丰产运动
    中共江西省委员会号召全省广大农业生产合作社社员，用开展水稻千斤丰产运动的模范行为来争取今年农业生产的全面大丰收。中共江西省委员会农村工作部已经提出在全省农村开展千斤丰产运动的初步计划。
    中共江西省委员会同时要求全省各级党组织抓住当前各项工作的中心环节，立即全党动员、全力以赴地领导农业增产运动，全面地检查和推动生产准备工作，并大力组织推广各项先进经验。
    江西省仅九江、上饶等四个专区今年计划争取水稻每亩平均产量达到1，000斤的，就有26个区、881个乡和8，535个农业生产合作社，面积共237万多亩。目前这四个专区的农民已经积起的肥料达15亿担，超过去年同期一倍以上。南昌、抚州等专区大规模整修圩堤的计划已经全部提前超额完成，兴修小型农田水利工程和冬耕灭虫等工作都有了很大的进展。学习和交流丰产经验的活动已在许多地方热烈展开。　（据新华社讯）
