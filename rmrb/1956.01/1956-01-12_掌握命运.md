Mastering Destiny
By Our Correspondent Fan Rongkang

The Yili Food Company is one of the earliest public-private joint ventures in Beijing. Over the four years since its establishment as a joint venture, this precarious capitalist enterprise has transformed into the largest food factory in North China.

Ni Jiaxi is the private shareholder representative of Yili Food Company, currently serving as the deputy manager. His grandfather was a capitalist, his father was also a capitalist, and he himself has been rooted in the capitalist market for over 20 years. More than 20 years ago, he founded the Dahua Industrial Cooperative. He heavily advertised in the streets, newspapers, and magazines, claiming that Dahua Industrial Cooperative's Spearmint toothpaste was "formulated by American technicians" and had a "fruity flavor." At that time, he was obsessed with advertising, believing that it determined product sales. The advertising expenses for Spearmint toothpaste alone exceeded the entire revenue of Dahua Industrial Cooperative. However, Ni Jiaxi didn't care, feeling this showed his foresight. He fantasized that one day Dahua Industrial Cooperative's Spearmint toothpaste would be as famous as "Coca-Cola," and that his business would spread throughout the country. However, before he could earn a single yuan, the Japanese imperialists' claws reached Shanghai. A bomb destroyed Dahua Industrial Cooperative, also destroying Ni Jiaxi's initial dreams.

After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Ni Jiaxi went to the Kuomintang-controlled areas. He quickly discovered that organizing a transportation company was a "golden opportunity." He immediately bought two trucks to run the roads, which later grew to four, eight, twenty, and forty, establishing the Lianhua Transportation Company.

Ni Jiaxi became complacent, believing he was clever and resourceful, and that nothing was impossible for him. However, Lianhua Transportation Company's golden age was fleeting. Soon after, the government-run Central Trust Bureau established a transportation company, the China Textile Trading Company also had a transportation brigade, and Song Ziwen's Yangzi Company set up a transportation department. Private transportation companies could not get goods, could not buy gasoline, and their business scope shrank. Occasionally, when fully loaded, they faced layers of checkpoints and extortion along the way. Under various forms of oppression, Lianhua Transportation Company was left with only two trucks. When the Kuomintang retreated to Guizhou, these two trucks were also lost. Ni Jiaxi, along with tens of thousands of refugees, fled on foot. His only daughter died during the escape.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Ni Jiaxi returned to Shanghai. The capital from his hometown greatly revitalized him. He quickly expanded his operations, successively establishing enterprises such as Yanhua Industrial Cooperative and Yangqing Long-Distance Bus Transportation Company, and rebuilding the Spearmint Chemical Products Factory. At this time, Ni Jiaxi and other capitalists jointly bought the British-owned Yili Foreign Firm, renaming it Yili Food Factory.

Yili Foreign Firm was one of the four famous food companies in Shanghai at the time. Ni Jiaxi and others thought they could make a fortune with Yili's reputation. Unexpectedly, American goods flooded the market, and American chocolate and American fruit candies were everywhere. Yili Food Factory's sales plummeted. Eventually, the factory could barely operate for ten to fifteen days a month, with only outdated machinery and sixty-odd workers remaining. Funds were so depleted that even wages could not be paid.

Ni Jiaxi's other enterprises, under the frenzied economic aggression of American imperialism and the stranglehold of Kuomintang reactionary rule, also faced unprecedented misfortune. Running businesses became increasingly hopeless, while the speculative market became more active day by day. Ni Jiaxi also transferred funds from his enterprises to the speculative market, engaging in large-scale trading of gold, U.S. dollars, and cotton yarn, constantly buying and selling short.

Shanghai was liberated, and the speculative market was banned. Ni Jiaxi had to return to running his businesses, focusing his main efforts on Yili Food Factory. However, the factory continued its old practices, maintaining a self-important attitude of exclusively producing "high-end food," disconnected from the needs of the general public. The sales of Yili Food Factory's products remained sluggish. Yili Food Factory's raw material supply and product sales were entirely connected to the capitalist free market; and the scope of the capitalist free market in our country was shrinking with the continuous growth of the socialist economy. Without being linked to the state-owned economy, it became increasingly difficult to obtain raw materials and sell products. At the same time, labor-capital disputes within the enterprise became increasingly acute. Workers were unwilling to be exploited by capitalists and disliked the backward and chaotic phenomena of capitalist management, resulting in low production morale.

Thus, Ni Jiaxi's calculations were again thwarted, and Yili Food Factory fell into the predicament of being unable to pay wages. But Ni Jiaxi was unwilling to accept defeat. He took a drastic measure, renting out six retail outlets, using the deposit to expand working capital, thinking the company's situation would improve. However, in a few months, the working capital was lost again, and the enterprise was on its last breath. Yili Food Factory not only failed to make Ni Jiaxi money, but became a burden to him.

In this impasse, Yili Food Factory accepted state investment, becoming a public-private joint venture, and moved from Shanghai to Beijing, renamed Yili Food Company.

The public-private joint venture of Yili Food Factory was truly a blessing for Ni Jiaxi. He secretly rejoiced, thinking that the burden had finally been passed on to the state; if there were further losses, the state would be responsible. However, he had not recovered such a large sum of money, so in addition to rejoicing, he couldn’t help but feel a little regret. Seeing that after the implementation of the public-private joint venture, there was more capital, he wanted to seize this opportunity to make a big splash. Therefore, when the board of directors of the public-private joint venture Yili Food Company asked him to be the manager, he dispelled his initial thought of taking the opportunity to leave Yili Food Factory. Taking advantage of the fact that the public representatives were unfamiliar with the business and unclear about how to transform the enterprise, he manipulated the entire Yili Food Company, retaining the capitalist management methods unchanged. In this way, although Yili Food Company displayed the "public-private joint venture" signboard, for Ni Jiaxi, what he accepted was not the leadership of the socialist economic component in the enterprise, nor the state's socialist transformation of him, but merely an investment. In Ni Jiaxi's view, this state investment was no different from other private investments, both being his capital for developing capitalism.

Under Ni Jiaxi's leadership, Yili Food Company inherited the corrupt practices of the old Yili Food Factory in both operation and management, resulting in monthly losses, just like the old Yili Food Factory. In particular, Ni Jiaxi pursued exorbitant profits, marking up chocolate candy that cost just over three yuan per pound to eight yuan, further hindering sales. Public representatives repeatedly urged Ni Jiaxi to change the operating policy, adopt small profits but quick turnover, cater to the masses, but Ni Jiaxi remained headstrong, ignoring the public representatives' suggestions. As a result, Yili Food Company again fell into difficulties. By the beginning of 1952, not only was all working capital lost, but also a debt of 75,000 yuan was incurred. At this time, the "Five-Anti" campaign began. The debt of 75,000 yuan shocked all employees of Yili Food Company. Everyone was angered by Ni Jiaxi's refusal to accept the leadership of the socialist economic component, which ultimately led to the collapse of the enterprise. At the same time, veteran workers also exposed Ni Jiaxi's illegal acts of overvaluing assets and currying favor with workers during the joint venture. In the face of the powerful strength of the working class, Ni Jiaxi had to lower his head and admit his guilt.

At this point, Ni Jiaxi gradually realized that society had changed, and the road to developing capitalism was no longer viable. An irresistible socialist force was transforming the capitalist system, and he could not help but fail by standing in opposition to this force.

After the "Five-Anti" campaign, Yili Food Company's outlook was completely renewed.

During the "Five-Anti" campaign, Yili Food Company simultaneously completed the enterprise's democratic reform, greatly enhancing the workers' political awareness and production enthusiasm. At the same time, during Ni Jiaxi's suspension for reflection, the temporary administrative team led by the public representatives passed a resolution to change the business policy, lower prices, adopt small profits but quick turnover, cater to the masses, and gradually reduce economic ties with the free market. The volume of orders for processing for department stores, cooperatives, and government organizations greatly increased. The socialist economic component established an unshakable leading position in the enterprise.

When the "Five-Anti" campaign ended, and Ni Jiaxi returned to Yili Food Company as deputy manager, the enterprise had already shifted from monthly losses to monthly profits. The daily output of candy increased from 300 jin to 600-700 jin, and the daily output of biscuits increased from 900 jin to over 1,000 kilograms.

The enterprise stabilized, and there was a future. Ni Jiaxi's life also stabilized, and he also had a future. – This future is to accept socialist transformation, abandon exploitation, and become a self-reliant laborer. This is a bright future.

Faced with this future, Ni Jiaxi hesitated for a while and was once passive. However, it is impossible to remain passive forever. There are only two roads, and if you don't take that one, you take this one. Ni Jiaxi is a member of the enterprise. The enterprise is being transformed. He works in this enterprise, sitting in a building with public representatives, meeting with workers every day, and he must transform himself. Ni Jiaxi's family is a cell of society. Society is progressing, and his family is also progressing. His four sons are either Communist Party members or have joined the army. They urge him to progress. Ni Jiaxi is a smart person who understands the times. Since the road to developing capitalism is not viable, and accepting socialist transformation does indeed have a future, he embarked on the road of accepting socialist transformation.

After embarking on this road, Ni Jiaxi realized that this road was much wider than he had initially imagined. The public representatives helped him, educated him, respected his authority, corrected his mistakes, and encouraged his progress. The workers also proactively improved their relationship with him. He felt that he was not an insignificant person in the enterprise. All his correct opinions could be adopted in the enterprise. When launching the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, he created a paper bag for packing four liang of sugar. Based solely on the batch of orders processed for Beijing Department Store at the time, more than 20,000 yuan could be saved. He suggested changing the wrapping paper for fruit bread from six open to eight open, and suggested adding hard wax oil to the waxed paper, which not only reduced costs but also improved quality. These good suggestions were welcomed by the employees.

Yili Food Company has developed rapidly, becoming a successful example of public-private joint ventures in Beijing, and has a certain influence in Beijing's business community. Ni Jiaxi has also been elected as an executive member of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, chairman of the Beijing Candy Industry Association, and a representative to the Beijing People's Congress. After the Second Meeting of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Ni Jiaxi was not only planning to implement a fixed interest rate method in Yili Food Company, but also running around among his peers, planning the industry-wide joint venture of Beijing's candy industry.

Ni Jiaxi has never been so full of confidence in his future as he is now. Because he has combined his future with the future of society, he has, for the first time in his life, mastered his own destiny.

    掌握命运
    本报记者  范荣康
    义利食品公司是北京市最早出现的公私合营企业之一。公私合营的四年多来，这个朝不保夕的资本主义的烂摊子，变成了华北区最大的一家食品工厂。
    倪家玺是义利食品公司的私股代表，现在担任副经理的职务。他的祖父是资本家，他的父亲也是资本家，他自己立足于资本主义市场也已经有20多年了。20多年前，他创办了大华实业社。在街头上，报纸上，杂志上大吹大擂地做广告，宣传大华实业社出产的留兰香牙膏是“美国技师配方，”有“水果香味”，那时他迷信广告，认为广告决定商品的销路，留兰香牙膏的广告直做到这样的程度：整个大华实业社的营业收入还不足以支付留兰香牙膏这一种产品的广告费，但倪家玺满不在乎，他觉得这正是自己目光远大，他幻想着有一天大华实业社出产的留兰香牙膏会同“可口可乐”齐名，幻想着有一天自己经营的企业会遍布全国。然而，还没有等他赚回一元钱，日本帝国主义的魔爪伸向上海，一颗炸弹毁灭了大华实业社，也毁灭了倪家玺最初的幻想。
    抗战爆发后，倪家玺到了国民党统治区，他很快就发现组织运输公司是“喇叭一响，黄金万两”，马上买了两辆大卡车跑公路，后来就四辆、八辆、二十辆、四十辆的发展起来，成立了联华运输公司。
    倪家玺得意起来，觉得自己脑筋灵活、办法多，没有什么事情是办不到的。可是，联华运输公司的黄金时代也只是昙花一现。不久之后，官办的中央信托局成立了运输公司，花纱布公司也有了运输大队，宋子文的扬子公司也设立了运输部，私营的运输公司接不到货，买不到汽油，营业范围越来越小，偶而装满了货，一路上还有重重关卡敲榨勒索。在多方摧残下，联华运输公司最后只剩下两辆卡车，到国民党向贵州溃退时，这两辆卡车也没有了，倪家玺和成千成万的难民一起徒步逃难，他唯一的女儿就在逃难的路上死去了。
    抗战胜利后，倪家玺回到上海。老家的资本大大充实了他，他迅速把摊子铺了开来，先后成立了炎华实业社、杨清长途汽车运输公司等企业，重建了留兰香化学制品厂。也在这时，倪家玺同其他一些资本家合股，把英商义利洋行买下来，更名为义利食品厂。
    义利洋行是当时上海著名的四大食品公司之一。倪家玺等满以为凭着义利的名声，可以大赚一笔。不料美货倾销，市场上到处是美国巧克力、美国水果糖，义利食品厂的产品销路很快就一落千丈，到最后每月只能勉强开工十天半月，全厂只剩下一套陈旧的机器和六十多个工人，资金枯竭到连工资都发不出去。
    倪家玺经营的其他企业，在美国帝国主义疯狂的经济侵略下，在国民党反动统治的扼杀下，也遇到前所未有的厄运。办企业越来越没有前途，投机市场却一天比一天活跃起来。倪家玺也把资金从企业里转到投机市场上来，大做起黄金、美钞和棉纺生意，整天买空卖空。
    上海解放了，投机市场被取缔了。倪家玺只得回过头来经营企业，把主要精力用到义利食品厂来。但是这个厂沿袭旧习，摆着一付专门生产“高级食品”的自命不凡的架子，脱离广大人民的需要，产品销路始终不能打开。义利食品厂的原料供应和产品推销全部是同资本主义自由市场发生关系的；而资本主义自由市场的活动范围，在我们的国家里，随着社会主义经济的不断增长，是越来越小了，不同国营经济挂钩，原料来源和产品销售就越来越困难。同时，在企业内部，劳资纠纷也日益尖锐，工人们不愿意受资本家的剥削，看不惯资本主义经营管理的各种落后的和混乱的现象，生产情绪不高。
    这样，倪家玺的如意算盘又落空了，义利食品厂又陷入发不出工资的困境。但倪家玺还不甘心失败，他一狠心，把六个门市部都租出去，拿了一笔押金，扩大了流动资金，满以为流动资金多了，企业的情况就会好转。可是，没有几个月的时间，流动资金又赔光了，企业奄奄一息，义利食品厂不但没有让倪家玺赚钱，反而成了他的包袱。
    在无路可走中，义利食品厂接受了国家的投资，变成公私合营企业，并从上海迁到北京来，改名为义利食品公司。
    义利食品厂公私合营，对倪家玺说来真是一个福音。他私心窃喜，认为这个包袱总算扔给国家了；再赔钱，该由国家来管。可是，这么大一笔资金没有捞回来，窃喜之余不免又有几分惋惜。再看到实行公私合营后，资金多了，很想抓着这笔本钱再大干一场。因此，当公私合营义利食品公司董事会让他当经理的时候，他打消了最初想乘机离开义利食品厂的念头，利用公股代表不熟悉业务，不明确怎样改造企业的弱点，操纵了整个义利食品公司的大权，把资本主义的经营管理方法原封不动地保留下来。这样，义利食品公司虽然挂出了“公私合营”的牌子，但对倪家玺说来，他所接受的不是社会主义经济成分在企业中的领导，不是国家对他的社会主义改造，而仅仅是一笔投资。这笔国家投资在倪家玺看来，同其他私人投资并没有什么区别，都一样是他发展资本主义的本钱。
    倪家玺主持的义利食品公司无论在经营上、管理上都继承了旧义利食品厂的一套腐朽的办法，结果也和旧义利食品厂一样月月亏本。特别是倪家玺追求暴利，一斤巧克力糖成本只三元多，却标价八元，更闭塞了销路。公股代表屡次督促倪家玺改变经营方针，薄利多销、面向大众，但倪家玺仍然独断独行，对公股代表的建议不理。这样，义利食品公司又陷入困境。到1952年年初，全部流动资金赔光不算，还负债75，000元。这时候，“五反”运动开始了，75，000元的负债震惊了义利食品公司的全体职工，大家被倪家玺拒绝接受社会主义经济成分的领导，终致把企业搞垮的罪行激怒起来，同时，老工人们又揭露了倪家玺在合营时高估财产，拉拢工人的非法行为。在工人阶级强大的威力面前，倪家玺不得不低头认罪。
    到这时候，倪家玺才逐渐认识到社会已经变了，发展资本主义的道路已经走不通了。一股不可抗拒的社会主义力量改造着资本主义制度，他站在和这力量对抗的地位，就不能不失败。
    “五反”运动之后，义利食品公司的面貌焕然一新。
    在“五反”运动中，义利食品公司同时完成了企业的民主改革，大大提高了工人的政治觉悟和生产积极性。同时，在倪家玺停职反省期间，以公股代表为首组成的临时行政小组通过了决议，改变营业方针，降低价格，薄利多销，面向大众，并逐渐缩小了同自由市场的经济联系，为百货公司、合作社和机关团体加工订货的业务量大大增加。社会主义经济成分在企业中树立了不可动摇的领导地位。
    当“五反”运动结束，倪家玺回到义利食品公司担任副经理时，这个企业已经从月月亏损走向月月有盈余了。糖果的日产量从三百斤提高到六、七百斤，饼干的日产量从九百斤提高到一千多公斤。
    企业稳定下来，有了前途。倪家玺的生活也稳定下来，也有了前途。——这个前途，就是接受社会主义改造，放弃剥削，变成一个自食其力的劳动者。这是一个光明的前途。
    在这个前途的面前，倪家玺犹豫了一阵，一度表现消极。但是，永远消极下去是不行的。路只是两条，不走那条，就走这条。倪家玺是企业中的一分子，企业在改造，他在这个企业里工作，同公股代表坐在一幢房子里，天天和工人见面，也不得不改造自己。倪家玺的家庭是社会的一个细胞，社会在进步，他的家庭也在进步，他的四个儿子有的是共产党员，有的参加了部队，他们督促着他进步。倪家玺是一个识时务的聪明人，发展资本主义的道路既然走不通，接受社会主义改造确实还有前途，也就跨上了接受社会主义改造的大路。
    跨上了这条大路之后，倪家玺才发现这条路比自己最初设想的要宽广得多。公股代表帮助他，教育他，尊重他的职权，纠正他的错误，鼓励他进步，工人们也主动改善同他的关系，他觉得自己在企业中并不是一个可有可无的人，他的一切正确的意见都能在企业里被采纳。在开展增产节约竞赛的时候，他创造了一种装四两糖的纸袋，仅就当时为北京市百货公司加工的一批业务计算，就可以节省二万多元。他建议把果子面包的包装纸改六开为八开，建议掺硬腊油烫腊纸，不仅降低了成本，而且提高了质量。这些好的建议都受到了职工们的欢迎。
      义利食品公司日益发展起来，成为北京市公私合营企业中一个成功的先例，在北京市工商界中有一定的影响。倪家玺也先后被选为北京市工商业联合会的执行委员，北京市糖果行业公会的主任委员和北京市人民代表大会的代表。中华全国工商业联合会执行委员会第二次会议之后，倪家玺一面筹划着在义利食品公司推行定息的办法，一面奔走于同业之间，计划着北京市糖果业的全行业合营。
    倪家玺对自己的前途从来没有像现在这样充满了信心。因为他已经把自己的前途同社会的前途结合起来，他有生以来第一次掌握了自己的命运。（附图片）
