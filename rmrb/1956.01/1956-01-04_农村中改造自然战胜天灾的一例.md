An Example of Transforming Nature and Overcoming Natural Disasters in Rural Areas
	National People's Congress Representative Zeng San
	During my recent inspection tour in Hebei Province, I visited several agricultural production cooperatives and a reservoir project in Mancheng County. Many new things gave me a very profound socialist education. The most prominent point is that I saw everywhere the peasant masses carrying out a truly earth-shaking labor of transforming nature in order to build a beautiful socialist future.
	Comrades from the Mancheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party told us that Mancheng's cotton and grain production increased in 1955. There were many reasons for the increase, one of which was the construction of 40,000 mu of furrowed and ridged fields. These 40,000 mu of furrowed and ridged fields produced a total of 850,000 jin of grain and 288,000 jin of seed cotton more than before the transformation. This experience is not only being widely promoted by the peasant masses throughout Mancheng County, but also people from other counties in Hebei Province and even some places in Henan Province have come to visit and learn. During the period from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, Mancheng County plans to build another 196,000 mu of furrowed and ridged fields, striving to increase grain production by 4.9 million jin and seed cotton by 2.12 million jin from this transformation project in 1956. This year, more than 200 large reservoirs, small reservoirs, and gully dams will be built in mountainous and high-lying areas, forming a county-wide plan to transform nature. We were very excited to hear this news.
	The western part of Mancheng is mountainous, and the eastern part has more than 300,000 mu of plains. These plains are high in the west and low in the east. The high ground is afraid of drought, and the low ground is afraid of flooding. For example, there is a low-lying area in Yaozhuang Village that farmers call "Toad Pit," meaning that even a toad's urination would cause a flood. There is also a low-lying area that farmers call "Regret Land." If you sow seeds one year and it happens to rain a lot, with water accumulating several feet deep, there will be no harvest, which is regrettable; if you don't sow seeds another year and it happens to be dry, you could have a bumper harvest, which is also regrettable.
	The liberated and collectivized peasants came up with a good solution: universally building furrowed and ridged fields in the higher plains. Building ridged fields means dividing the land into ridges and building earthen embankments about a foot high around them (these "ridges" are much larger than the ridges for growing vegetables, with one ridge being tens to hundreds of mu). After sowing, the large ridges are divided into several smaller ridges, and more small earthen embankments are built. When it rains, this kind of ridged field keeps the rainwater within the land, allowing it to slowly seep into the soil, which can retain moisture and protect fertilizers from being washed away. Another benefit is that the rainwater is contained in the high ground, making it less likely for the low-lying areas to flood. Building furrows means digging ditches between large areas of ridged fields, allowing excess water from the ridged fields to overflow into the furrows. When there is not too much water in the furrows, it can be stored; only when there is too much water will it flow downstream. Building furrows in low-lying areas has the functions of guiding water outflow and storing water, as well as "draining water." Some low-lying areas are often too wet in the autumn, making it inconvenient to sow winter wheat. With furrows, the land drains relatively drier. The so-called furrowed and ridged fields are thus composed of thousands upon thousands of mu of plains land formed by furrows and ridged fields.
	In low-lying areas such as "Regret Land," there is another method of transformation. "Regret Land" not only often has "guest water" from the high ground converging here, but its own groundwater level is also very high; water can be found a foot or two below the surface. In the past, farmers who had land in "Regret Land" could only hope for dry weather to have a good year. Now that furrowed and ridged fields have been built in the high ground, reducing the threat of "guest water" converging in the low-lying areas, the masses have carried out a further transformation project to ensure harvests, called building terraced fields. They divide thousands of mu of "Regret Land" into several rectangular blocks, half of which are converted into paddy fields, and the other half into "terraced fields." The specific method of construction is as follows: dig about two feet deep of soil from the second, fourth, sixth… blocks and push it onto the first, third, fifth… blocks, thus lowering the second, fourth, sixth… blocks to become paddy fields, which can be planted with rice, while raising the first, third, fifth… blocks to become "terraced fields," which can be planted with dry rice and other crops.
	We visited the largest reservoir project, which can store 500,000 cubic meters of water, built near Liujiacuo. I was so moved that tears streamed down my face when I saw the labor enthusiasm shown by the more than 600 men, women, and children at the reservoir construction site. It was already winter, but they were wearing single layers of clothing and still sweating profusely. In particular, the general male and female youth, carrying burdens of more than 100 jin, were like racers, truly admirable and lovable. One of the representatives who accompanied us wanted to take a group photo of a team of young women, but they couldn't put down their baskets or stop their feet because their hearts were only thinking about the earthwork project.
	The entire project of this reservoir, except for more than 10,000 yuan in large tools and material costs subsidized by the People's Government, required a total of more than 40,000 workdays, all of which were voluntarily participated in by the farmers. Most of them were from the beneficiary villages, some were from villages that benefited less or not directly, and some were youth shock brigades sent from even more distant villages. They were all cooperative members, knowing the benefits of this construction for the people of the county, so they were all willing to participate. The cooperatives also supported them, recording their workdays in the "capital construction work" account, and a certain amount of remuneration can be paid within a few years.
	The cooperative members all understood that whether it was building ridged or terraced fields, it would not be possible without collectivization, let alone building reservoirs or furrows. Although the project of building ridged or terraced fields is relatively simple, it must be carried out on large areas of land, which not only individual households and mutual aid teams cannot do, but also small cooperatives or individual cooperatives cannot do well. Mancheng County has basically collectivized, with the number of households joining the cooperative accounting for 82.2% of the total number of households, which is the social condition that allows for large-scale transformation of the terrain. For example, Yaozhuang Village and Jia Zhuang Village, with a total of 435 households, jointly established a cooperative, with 427 households joining. They built ridged and terraced fields, and also built nine furrows; however, Da Biantuo Village, with a total of 186 households, now has two cooperatives, with a total of 128 members (of which 100 are newly joined). In 1955, they did not have time to build furrows and ridged fields on a large scale. The cooperative members’ understanding of the benefits of setting up cooperatives is not only well-known to every household but also deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The emotion of cherishing the cooperative shown by the cooperative members we visited is truly indescribable. Some old women, when talking to us, revealed their inner joy; due to the increased production of the cooperative, they were full of confidence in their later years and the future of their children and grandchildren. When the poor peasant Song Qingquan received us, he showed us all his new clothes, new quilt, thermos, and flashlight, and said, "I have eaten and used them, and I still have savings." His mother recounted the good situation after the emancipation, praising the cooperative and thanking the Communist Party. The two cooperatives in Da Biantuo Village were holding a merger meeting on December 10th. We went to listen, and we did not hear any objections to the merger. Although they only merged three cooperatives into two cooperatives after autumn and developed 100 new cooperative members, they could all explain the benefits of setting up cooperatives and large cooperatives. The two biggest reasons are: it is convenient for mechanized farming, and it is also possible to build furrows and ridged fields. Therefore, it can be concluded that in places like Mancheng, there is no doubt that agricultural production will increase in 1956 and cooperatives will be further developed.

　　农村中改造自然战胜天灾的一例
    全国人民代表大会代表　曾三
    我这次到河北省视察工作，访问了满城县的几个农业生产合作社和一个水库工程，许多新事给了我极为深刻的社会主义教育。最突出的一点，就是到处看到农民群众为了建设社会主义的美景在进行着一种改造自然的真正翻天复地的劳动。
    中国共产党满城县委的同志告诉我们，1955年满城的棉花和粮食都增产了，增产的原因很多，其中一个就是修了四万亩沟洫畦田。这四万亩沟洫畦田，比没有改造以前，共增产粮食85万斤、籽棉288，000斤。这个经验不仅满城全县的农民群众在普遍地推广，河北省的其他县以至河南省的一些地方都派了人来参观和学习。满城县在1955年冬季和1956年春季这一段时间内，计划再修沟洫畦田196，000亩，争取在1956年从这一项改造工程中增产粮食490万斤，籽棉212万斤。今年还要在山区和高地修大水库、小水库和谷坊工程共计二百多处，这就组成了一个全县改造自然的大计划。我们听了这些消息十分兴奋。
    满城西部是山区，东部有30多万亩平原地。这些平原地西高东低，高地怕旱，低地又怕涝。例如要庄村有一块低洼地，农民管它叫做“蛤蟆坑”，就是说，蛤蟆撒尿也会遭水灾的。还有一块低洼地，农民管它叫“后悔地”。这一年播下种吧，恰好遇上多雨，积水数尺，颗粒无收，令人后悔；另一年不播种吧，又恰好遇上天旱，可获丰收，也只有后悔。
    解放了又合作化了的农民想出了好办法：在较高的平原地上普遍地修起沟洫畦田来。修畦田，就是把土地分成一畦一畦，在周围打起一尺来高的土埂（这种“畦”比种菜的畦是大得多的，一畦就是几十亩到百多亩）。播种以后还把大畦分成若干小畦，再打若干小土埂。这样的畦田，当下雨的时候，把雨水围在地内，让它慢慢地渗到土里去，既可以保持水分，又可以保护肥料不被冲洗，还有一个好处就是在高地把雨水围住了，低洼地也不容易涝。修沟洫，就是在一大片畦田之间，挖出一道道的沟洫，让畦田里装不了的水溢到沟洫里去，在沟洫里的水不太多的时候可以储蓄起来，只有水太多了的时候才会向下游流走。在低地修沟洫，除了有导水外流和蓄水的作用以外，还有“沥水”的作用。有些低地在秋天常常过于潮湿，不便播种冬麦，有了沟洫，土地就沥得比较干一些。所谓沟洫畦田，就是这样由沟洫和畦田组成的成千成万亩的平原土地。
    在“后悔地”一类的低洼地，还有另一种改造的方法。“后悔地”不仅常有高地的“客水”往这里汇集，而且它本身的地下水位很高，挖下一二尺就有水。往年在“后悔地”有土地的农民只能希望天旱才有好年成。现在高地修了沟洫畦田，低洼地减少了“客水”汇集的威胁，群众又进行了一个进一步保证收成的改造工程，叫做修台田。他们把成千亩的“后悔地”划成若干长方块，一半修成水田，另一半就修成了“台田”。具体的修法是这样：在第二块、第四块、第六块……挖出二尺左右深的土来，推到第一块、第三块、第五块……的上面，这样把第二块、第四块、第六块……挖低下去，成了水田，可以种水稻，同时使第一块、第三块、第五块……垫高起来，成为“台田”，可以种旱稻和其他作物。
    我们参观了最大的一个水库工程，这个水库可以蓄水50万立方公尺，建筑在柳家撮附近。我在这个水库的工地上见到男女老少六百多人所表现的那种劳动热情，就感动得流下了眼泪。已经是冬天了，他们穿着单褂，还满头淌着大汗，尤其是一般男女青年，挑着一百多斤的重担，像赛跑一样，真是可敬可爱。我们同去的一位代表想给一队女青年照一个集体像，但是她们放不下筐子，停不住脚，因为她们的心都只是想着土方工程。
    这个水库的全部工程，除大工具和材料费一万多元由人民政府补助以外，共需四万多个劳动日都是由农民自动参加的。他们中的大部分是受益乡村的群众，一部分是受益不多的或不直接受益的乡村来帮助的群众，还有一部分是更远的乡村派来帮忙的青年突击队。他们都是合作社社员，知道这个建设对全县人民的好处，所以都愿意参加。社里也都支持他们，把他们的劳动日记在“基建工”的账上，几年之内可以付给一定的报酬。
    社员都理解，不论是修畦田或台田，如果没有合作化是办不到的，更不要说修水库或沟洫了。修畦田或台田的工程虽然比较简单，但是都必须在大片的土地上才能施工，这不但单干户、互助组办不到，就是小型的合作社或个别的合作社也办不好。满城县已经基本上合作化，入社农户占农户总数82.2％，这是能够大量改造地形的社会条件。例如，要庄村和贾庄村共435户，合办一个合作社，入社的有427户，他们修了畦田和台田，还修了九道沟洫；但是大边坨村，全村186户，现在有两个合作社，共有社员128户（其中一百户是新入社的），1955年就来不及大规模地修沟洫畦田。社员对办社的好处，不但家喻户晓，而且深入人心。我们访问的社员那种爱护合作社的情绪真是无法形容。一些老大娘同我们谈话，都表露了她们内心的愉快；由于合作社的增产，她们对自己的晚景和子孙的前途满怀信心。贫农宋清泉在接待我们的时候，把新衣、新被、暖壶、手电筒全都点给我们看，并且说：“我吃了用了，还有存款”。他的母亲对我们历数翻身后的好境，满口称赞合作社，感谢共产党。大边坨村的两个社，12月10日正在开并社大会，我们去旁听了，没有听到有反对并社的意见。他们虽然只是在秋后才由三个社并为二个社并且发展新社员一百户，但是他们都能说出办社和办大社的好处，其中两条最大的道理，就是：便于机耕，还可以修沟洫畦田。因此可以断定，像满城这样的地方，1956年农业的增产和进一步地发展合作社，是毫无疑义的。
