    Ministry of Railways to Reinstate Issuing Reimbursement Vouchers to Passengers

    Many readers have written letters requesting the railway authorities to reinstate the practice of issuing reimbursement vouchers to passengers to facilitate the reimbursement of train tickets and baggage consignment fees for those on business trips. The Passenger Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has studied these opinions and decided to implement the following measures starting February 1, 1956:

    I. Passengers holding various types of regular tickets (i.e., passenger tickets, express tickets, sleeper tickets, etc., printed with fixed origin and destination station names and fares) who require a reimbursement receipt can declare it upon exiting the station. After the ticket inspector tears off a corner of the ticket, it will be given to the passenger as a reimbursement voucher.

    II. Passengers holding passenger tickets that must be collected (i.e., supplementary tickets, multiple-ride passenger tickets, and suburban season tickets) who require a reimbursement receipt can declare it to the station passenger service office after purchasing the ticket. The passenger service office will then issue a separate proof of payment.

    III. Passengers consigning luggage or parcels who require a reimbursement receipt can declare it to the station or train conductor, who will resolve the matter.

    铁道部将恢复给旅客发报销凭证的做法
    不少读者来信，要求铁道部门恢复给旅客发报销凭证的做法，以便因公出差人员报销购买车票和托运行李的费用。铁道部旅客局研究了这些意见，决定从1956年2月1日起采取下列措施：
    一、持有各种常备票（即印有固定发到站名和票价的客票、快车票、卧铺票等）的旅客，如果需要报销收据，可以在出站时声明，经检票员把票撕去一角后，交给旅客作为报销凭证。
    二、持有必须回收的客票（即补充票、回数客票和市郊定期客票）的旅客，如果需要报销收据，在购票以后可以向车站旅客服务处声明，由旅客服务处另发给收款证明。
    三、托运行李或包裹的旅客，如果需要报销收据，可以向车站或列车长声明，由他们予以解决。
