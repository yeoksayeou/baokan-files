    To Complete One and a Half Days' Production Tasks Every Workday
    To the Editorial Staff:
    The entire staff of our Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, in order to realize the factory Party committee's guarantee of "completing the Five-Year Plan in 3 years and 10 months," have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm in production. On January 7th, we also proposed a friendly competition to fraternal factories and mines in Shanxi Province and fraternal factories and mines under the Third Machine Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    Since January of this year, many workshop production teams have overfulfilled their plans. Since January, 29 workers in the Standard Parts Workshop have completed 12-hour quotas every day. Han Shulin, a worker in this workshop, completed his annual task 100 days ahead of schedule last year, and this year he proposed to complete 15-hour quotas every day and strive to complete the annual workload in six and a half months. Several teams in the Forging and Riveting Workshop also proposed guarantees that they would do 70% to 80% more work than the quota every workday. Zhang Yuming, Han Shulin and 155 other advanced workers proposed the initiative of "completing one and a half workdays' production tasks every workday" (referred to as "one and a half quota"), which was immediately enthusiastically supported by the workers. The "one and a half quota" movement has been widely launched throughout the factory, and 69.5% of the workers in the Comprehensive Workshop have already participated in this movement. In the movement, many production teams, combined with the discussion of the factory's production plan, after careful calculation and tapping potential, put forward many guarantees to improve production, and suggested that the administrative leaders revise the past backward indicators and set practical and feasible advanced quotas, so that the work quotas meet the requirements of completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    While the production teams in various workshops are constantly completing production tasks ahead of schedule, technical personnel Shen Chengshu and others have proposed five initiatives to the factory's technical personnel, including preparing for the manufacture of new products ahead of schedule and conscientiously learning and promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union; technical inspection personnel Pang Jun and others have proposed initiatives to improve quality and reduce defective products; and staff in other departments have also put forward many feasible suggestions.
    At present, the entire staff of the factory is focusing on the glorious goal of "completing the Five-Year Plan in 3 years and 10 months," and is dedicating all their strength to realize their guarantees and initiatives!

    要在每个工作日完成一天半的生产任务编辑同志：
    我们太原矿山机器厂的全体职工，为了实现本厂党委提出的“3年10个月完成五年计划”的保证，在生产中发挥了高度的积极性。1月7日，我们还向山西省各兄弟厂矿和第一机械工业部第三机器工业管理局所属各兄弟厂矿提出了开展提前完成五年计划的友谊竞赛的建议。
    今年1月份以来，许多车间的生产小组都超额完成了计划。标准件车间1月份以来有29名工人每天都完成了12小时的定额。这个车间的工人韩树林去年提前100天完成了全年任务，今年又提出了每天完成15小时的定额、争取六个半月完成全年工作量的保证。锻铆车间几个小组也提出保证，每个工作日要做超过定额70％到80％的活。张玉明、韩树林等155个先进工人提出了“每个工作日完成一个半工作日的生产任务”（简称“个半定额”）的倡议，马上得到了职工们的热烈拥护和积极支持。“个半定额”运动在全厂广泛地展开了，综合车间已经有69.5％的工人参加了这个运动。在运动中，不少生产小组结合着讨论全厂的生产计划，经过算细账、挖潜力，提出了很多提高生产的保证，并且建议行政领导方面修改过去的落后指标，定出切实可行的先进定额，使工作定额符合于提早完成五年计划这个任务的要求。
    在各车间的生产小组不断提前完成生产任务的同时，技术人员沈承书等向全厂技术人员提出了提前做好制造新产品的准备工作和认真学习并推广苏联先进经验等5项倡议；技术检验人员庞俊等提出了提高质量、降低废品的倡议；其他各个部门的工作人员们也提出了很多可行的建议。
    目前，全厂职工正围绕着“3年10个月完成五年计划”的光荣目标，为实现自己的保证和倡议而献出全部力量！
