The All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued instructions on the 15th to women's federations at all levels to strengthen women's work in the agricultural cooperative movement.

The instructions pointed out that due to a lack of sensitivity to the socialist enthusiasm of the peasant masses, including women, and an insufficient understanding of the rapidly developing situation of the agricultural cooperative movement, there is a serious phenomenon of leadership in rural women's work lagging behind reality and work not keeping up with the development of the objective situation. In order to change this situation, women's federation cadres at all levels should conscientiously study and implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, as well as the comprehensive plans of local Party committees for the agricultural cooperative movement, eliminate all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas, and strengthen women's work in the agricultural cooperative movement.

The instructions pointed out that, first of all, it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of the broad masses of women, in conjunction with the specific problems that arise in each stage of establishing and rectifying cooperatives, constantly enhance their socialist consciousness, and guide them to resolutely take the path of collectivization. In particular, it is necessary to explain to the women masses that the path of agricultural collectivization is the path to common prosperity for all peasants, and also the path to complete liberation for rural women. Focus on educating female members to cherish the cooperative, and care about and actively participate in the management of cooperative affairs. Educate female members to diligently study and delve into production technology, learn culture, and learn scientific knowledge, and strive to improve labor efficiency, in order to fight for increased production. Continue to carry out collectivist education, strengthen the unity among family members of cooperative members, between male and female cooperative members, between female cooperative members, and with female laborers outside the cooperative, and promote mutual assistance among female cooperative members in life. Educate women to understand the situation of class struggle at home and abroad during the transition period, raise revolutionary vigilance at all times and in all places, strictly guard against enemy sabotage activities, and wage a resolute struggle against all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

Secondly, it is necessary to conscientiously publicize and implement the draft model regulations for agricultural production cooperatives, and carry out practical and effective work to realize the various provisions therein, especially the provisions concerning the rights and welfare of female members.

The instructions finally stated that in order to do the above two aspects of work well, effective specific measures should be taken. These measures are: First, make a comprehensive plan for women's work. Second, strengthen the work of grassroots women's representative conferences. Under the leadership of rural Party branches, mobilize women to complete the various tasks put forward by the local Party committee; in the organization of township women's representative conferences, a leading core composed of poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasant activists should be established; the rectification of township women's representative conferences must also be carried out uniformly in batches and in stages under the leadership of the Party branch, in conjunction with Party rectification and cooperative rectification. Finally, leadership must be strengthened. This requires first and foremost relying closely on the leadership of the Party, cooperating closely with various departments, and taking advantage of various opportunities to promote the unified carrying out of women's work by all cadres sent to the countryside; at the same time, strengthen contact with agricultural production cooperatives, and strengthen women's work within the cooperatives through the cooperatives; and be good at discovering and summarizing advanced experiences among the masses to educate the masses.

    全国妇联指示各级妇联
    加强农业合作化运动中的妇女工作
    中华全国民主妇女联合会为加强农业合作化运动中的妇女工作，15日向各级妇联发出指示。
    指示指出：由于对农民群众包括妇女群众的社会主义积极性缺乏敏感，对农业合作化运动迅速发展的形势认识不足，农村妇女工作上存在着领导落后于实际，工作赶不上客观形势发展的严重现象。为了改变这种情况，各级妇联干部应当认真学习和贯彻党中央、毛主席的指示和当地党委对农业合作化运动的全面规划，清除各种右倾保守思想，加强农业合作化运动中的妇女工作。
    指示指出：首先要结合建社、整社的各个阶段所发生的具体问题，加强对广大妇女群众的政治思想教育工作，不断地提高她们的社会主义觉悟，引导她们坚决走合作化的道路。特别要向妇女群众说明农业合作化的道路就是全体农民共同富裕的道路，也就是农村妇女获得彻底解放的道路。着重教育女社员爱护合作社，关心和积极参加社务管理工作。教育女社员刻苦地学习和钻研生产技术，学习文化，学习科学知识，努力提高劳动效率，为增加生产而斗争。继续进行集体主义教育，加强社员家庭成员之间、男女社员之间、女社员互相之间、同社外劳动妇女之间的团结，提倡女社员彼此在生活上的互助。教育妇女认识过渡时期国内外阶级斗争的形势，随时随地提高革命警惕性，严防敌人的破坏活动，同一切暗藏的反革命分子进行坚决的斗争。
    其次，要认真宣传和贯彻执行农业生产合作社示范章程草案，为实现其中的各项规定、特别是有关女社员的权利、福利的规定进行切实有效的工作。
    指示最后说：为了做好以上两方面的工作，应当采取有效的具体措施。这些措施是：首先做好妇女工作的全面规划。其次加强基层妇女代表会议的工作。在农村党的支部领导下发动妇女完成当地党委提出的各项任务；在乡妇代会的组织中应该树立由贫农和新老下中农积极分子组成的领导核心；乡妇代会的整顿，也必须在党支部的领导下结合整党、整社，分批、分期地统一进行。最后，要加强领导。这就必须首先紧紧地依靠党的领导，同各部门密切配合，利用各种机会推动全体下乡干部统一进行妇女工作；同时加强同农业生产合作社的联系，通过合作社加强社内的妇女工作；并且要善于发现和总结群众中的先进经验，用以教育群众。
