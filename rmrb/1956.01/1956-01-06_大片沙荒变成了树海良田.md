Large areas of sandy wasteland turned into a sea of trees and good farmland

Liu Zhenbang, Director of the Forestry Bureau of the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry

Southeastern Hebei Province is the famous North China Plain. Countless rivers of all sizes flowing from the mountains in the northwest run through it. The banks of the rivers were originally fertile farmland. However, during the past reactionary rule, the forests in the upper reaches of these rivers were completely destroyed, resulting in severe soil erosion, sand filling the river channels, and floods. This caused many fertile lands to turn into boundless sandy wastelands.

In the sandy wasteland areas of western Hebei, many fields were buried by drifting sand, wells were filled in, houses were collapsed, and roads were blocked. In the spring wind disaster of 1949, more than 130,000 mu of peas and wheat seedlings in Xinle County were damaged, with an average reduction of 60%. In seven villages including Beigaoli and Xijiazhuang in Xingtai County, 33 wells were filled with sand and 847 mu of fertile land became sandy wasteland from 1939 to 1949. In Dongciting Village, Zhengding County, a total of 34 houses collapsed due to sand pressure from 1945 to 1949. Near the Xinan Village Station and Dongchangshou Station of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, there were more than four miles of railway. Whenever there was a strong wind, the station had to send workers to patrol and protect the tracks day and night to remove sand and prevent the tracks from being buried. Land near the sandy wasteland could not only not grow wheat, but also had to sow seeds three or five times for millet, peanuts, and beans. Every spring when strong winds blew, farmers couldn't sleep well at night, worrying about the seedlings being buried by the wind and sand. As soon as the wind stopped, the whole family, young and old, went to the fields to shovel sand. At that time, the farmers often said: If anyone helps us control the wind and sand, we will build a temple for him!

After liberation, the Party and the People's Government, in accordance with the farmers' demands to overcome wind and sand disasters, and with reference to the Soviet Union's experience in building protective forests, led the farmers to start building protective forest belts in the three major sandy wastelands in western Hebei, the lower reaches of the Yongding River, the Nansha River, the Zhang River, and coastal areas.

From 1949 to 1950, sandy wasteland afforestation bureaus were established one after another in these sandy wasteland areas. Under the leadership and guidance of the government and the afforestation bureaus, the vast number of farmers organized themselves to carry out cooperative afforestation. In 105 villages in western Hebei alone, 256 forestry production cooperatives were established, afforesting 91,144 mu of sandy wasteland that was more than one hundred li long and dozens of li wide, basically completing the greening plan. In the lower reaches of the Yongding River, 364 villages established afforestation committees, and completed the forest belt construction plan within one year. The length of the forest belt network was more than 5,718 li.

After afforestation, the face of the sandy wasteland areas in Hebei Province has changed greatly. Now, when people take trains on the Beijing-Tianjin and Beijing-Hankou lines through these areas, they can no longer see large areas of sandy wasteland. After a short period of three years, the trees in the forest belt have generally grown to a height of one zhang, and the highest is more than two zhang.

In the 110,000 mu of sandy wasteland area in western Hebei, the protective forest has fixed the drifting sand, and most of the crops are not affected by wind and sand disasters. Sandy wasteland that could not be cultivated in the past can now grow wheat. According to a survey in 1953, under the protection of the forest network, more than 31,500 mu of new wheat fields were added, and wheat production increased by more than 3.78 million jin. In 1950 and 1951, only 150 mu of land in the Guanjiaopu Village of Zhengding County could grow wheat in the sandy wasteland area; after the young forest grew up, the wheat planting area increased by more than three times, and no land in the entire village was affected by wind and sand disasters, with a yield of 110 jin to 130 jin per mu. The river beach land in Dongshuangli Village, Zhengding County, used to be sown three or four times a year, with very little harvest. After the construction of the protective forest, it harvested 250 jin per mu in 1953. The farmers said: "The forest belt and forest network are better than iron walls and copper walls." In some places, farmers have planted fruit trees such as apples, peaches, apricots, and pears in the grid-shaped sandy land, and many have already blossomed and bear fruit. The forest belt also protects villages and roads. The houses in Dongciting Village, Zhengding County, have been completely free from wind and sand damage. The railway near Dongchangshou Station and Xinan Village Station is no longer affected by wind and sand.

In the sandy wasteland area on both sides of the lower reaches of the Yongding River, the protective forest has begun to reduce wind speed, increase ground temperature, reduce evaporation, and increase humidity, ensuring the bumper harvest of agricultural products. After afforestation in 1952, the crisscrossing forest belt network protected 980,000 mu of cultivated land in the lower reaches of the Yongding River, which can increase grain production by tens of millions of jin. According to a survey of six townships in the Third District of Yongqing County alone, the wheat planting area increased by more than 10,000 mu. In Daxing County, 97,500 mu of farmland is protected by the forest network. According to statistics in 1955, the yield per unit area increased by 20% compared with the past, with a total increase of more than 1.8 million jin of grain. Zhiziying, known as the first town east of Gu'an City, was once a relatively prosperous market town for industry and commerce; but later, due to wind and sand erosion, houses were buried and destroyed, residents were displaced, and the situation was bleak. After liberation, due to the large-scale tree planting and afforestation movement in this area, the drifting sand near the town has been basically fixed in recent years, effectively ensuring the safety of houses, wells, people, animals and villages. This town has begun to recover its prosperity.

Seeing that the protective forest has stopped the harm of wind and sand and turned large areas of sandy wasteland into tree seas and good farmland, the broad masses have laid the foundation for the confidence in transforming nature and enhanced their enthusiasm for building socialism. In the autumn and winter of 1955, all townships in the sandy wasteland area carried out comprehensive production plans including afforestation, and afforestation work was carried out on a more magnificent scale. In the Fourth District of Raoyang County, Shunyi, Sanhe, and Xianghe counties in the middle reaches of the Chaobai River, near the Gecun Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station in Shahe County, the lower reaches of the Shahe River in the Xingtai area, and the lower reaches of the Zhanghe River in the Handan area, agricultural cooperatives were used as the basis to carry out the movement of joint-society, joint-village, and joint-township construction of farmland protective forests. According to incomplete statistics, more than 157,000 meters of protective forest networks have been built.

Under the unified leadership of the Party and government, the agricultural and forestry departments of Hebei Province are carrying out planning for the construction of farmland protective forests and windbreak and sand-fixing forests. It is planned to build more than 2.56 million mu of farmland protective forests (forest land) in 12 years. After the protective forests grow up, 50 million mu of cultivated land in the plains and sandy wasteland areas will no longer be affected by wind, sand, and drought.

　　大片沙荒变成了树海良田
    河北省农林厅林业局局长　刘振邦
    河北省东南部是有名的华北大平原。由西北的万山丛中流出来的无数大小河流贯穿其间。河流两岸原来都是肥美的良田。但是在过去反动统治时期，这些河流上游山区的森林被破坏殆尽，形成了严重的水土冲刷，流沙填塞河道，洪水泛滥成灾，致使不少良田沃土变成了一望无垠的沙荒。
    在河北西部的沙荒地区，不少田地被流沙掩埋，水井被填干，房屋被压塌，道路被淤塞。在1949年春季的风灾中，新乐县就有13万多亩豌豆和麦苗受害，平均减产六成。行唐县的北高里、习家庄等七个村，从1939年到1949年有33眼水井被流沙填干，847亩良田变成沙荒。正定县东慈亭村，从1945年到1949年共有34间房屋被沙压塌。在京汉铁路的新安村车站和东长寿车站附近有四里多长的铁路，每逢大风天，车站就得派出工人，不分昼夜地巡路护轨，随时铲除沙子，以免路轨被埋盖。靠近沙荒的土地，不但不能种麦子，就是种谷子、落花生和豆类也常常要播三、五次种子。每年春季刮大风，农民在夜里总睡不好觉，担心禾苗被风沙埋没，只要风一住，就全家老少一齐出动到地里铲沙子。那时候农民常说：要是谁帮助咱们把风沙制服了，一定给他修个庙！
    解放后，党和人民政府根据农民群众战胜风沙灾害的要求，参照苏联营造防护林的经验，领导农民在冀西三大沙荒、永定河下游、南沙河、漳河和沿海地区开始营造防护林带。
    从1949年到1950年，这些沙荒地区相继成立了沙荒造林局。在政府和造林局的领导和指导下，广大农民组织起来进行合作造林，只在冀西105个村庄中，就建立了256个林业生产合作社，在一百多里长和几十里宽的沙荒地上造林91，144亩，基本上完成了绿化计划。永定河下游地区364个村，村村成立了造林委员会，一年内就完成了林带营造计划，林带林网的长度有5，718里多。
    造林以后，河北省的沙荒地区的面貌大大改变了。现在，人们坐京津线和京汉线火车经过这些地区时，已经看不到大片的沙荒了。经过短短的三年，林带的树木一般已长到一丈高，最高的有两丈多。
    在冀西11万亩沙荒地区，防护林已经把流沙固定下来，农作物大多不受风沙灾害。过去不能耕种的沙荒，现在已经能种小麦。据1953年调查统计，在林网保护下，新增麦田31，500多亩，增产小麦378万多斤。1950年和1951年正定县拐角铺村在沙荒地区仅有150亩地能种小麦；幼林长起后，小麦种植面积增加了三倍多，全村没有一块地受到风沙灾害，每亩产量达到110斤到130斤。正定县东双里村的河滩地，过去往往一年播种三、四次，收获量极小，营造防护林后，1953年每亩就收了250斤。农民说：“林带林网赛过铁壁铜墙。”有的地方农民在网格沙地种植了苹果、桃、杏、梨等果树，不少已经开花结果。林带也保护了村庄和道路，正定县东慈亭村的房屋已经完全免除了风沙危害。东长寿车站和新安村车站附近的铁路也不再受风沙危害了。
    在永定河下游两岸的沙荒地区，防护林开始起着减低风速，增加地温、降低蒸发量、增加湿度的作用，保证了农产物的丰收。1952年造林后，纵横交织的林带林网保护了永定河下游98万亩的耕地，这些耕地可以增产数千万斤粮食。仅据永清县三区六个乡的调查，小麦播种面积增加了一万多亩。大兴县有97，500亩农田受到林网保护，据1955年统计，单位面积产量较过去提高20％，共增产粮食180多万斤。号称固安城东第一镇的知子营，曾经是一个工商业较为繁荣的集镇；可是后来由于风沙侵袭，埋毁村舍房屋，居民流离失所，境况凄凉。解放后，由于这一带大规模地开展植树造林运动，几年来基本上固定了这个集镇附近的流沙，有效地保障了房舍、水井、人畜和村庄的安全，这个集镇开始恢复了繁荣气象。
    广大群众看到防护林制止了风沙的危害，使大片的沙荒变成了树海和良田，因而奠定了改造大自然的信心，增强了建设社会主义的热情。1955年秋冬，沙荒地区各乡都进行了包括造林在内的全面生产规划，造林工作以更加壮阔的规模开展起来了。饶阳县四区，潮白河中游的顺义、三河、香河各县，沙河县葛村农业机器拖拉机站附近，邢台专区沙河下游，邯郸专区漳河下游等地，都以农业合作社为基础开展了联社、联村、联乡营造农田防护林运动，据不完全统计，共计已经造防护林网157，000多公尺。
    河北省农林部门在党政统一领导下，正在进行农田防护林和防风防沙林的营造规划，计划在12年内营造农田防护林256万多亩（林占地），防护林长成后，将使平原和沙荒地区五千万亩耕地不再遭受风沙旱害。
