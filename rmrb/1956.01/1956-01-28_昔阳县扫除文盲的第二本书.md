Xiyang County's Second Literacy Textbook
Fang Tie

Recently, the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League helped the Education Bureau of Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, and the Xiyang County Committee of the Communist Youth League, to compile the "Xiyang County Farmers' Literacy Textbook," which is the second literacy textbook for eliminating illiteracy.

The "Work Point Literacy Textbook" is the first literacy textbook for eliminating illiteracy. The purpose of compiling the work point literacy textbook is to enable farmers to keep simple work records after reading it. The purpose of compiling the second textbook is to enable farmers to keep simple household accounts, write simple notices, notes, and letters, that is, to be able to initially use written language tools to participate in social life in a township, a county, or even a larger area. At the same time, through literacy, farmers will receive some patriotic and socialist ideological education.

The method of compiling this book is to start with the characters that farmers need most in their daily life and social life. The selected characters mainly include four aspects: First, those used in farming, including terms related to agricultural production and agricultural science and technology; second, those used in daily life, including terms related to firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, tea, cloth, and other affairs; third, those used in social life, which covers a wide range. The "Xiyang County Farmers' Literacy Textbook" focuses on selecting commonly used characters related to meetings, schooling, notices, letter writing, and reporting work; fourth, the affairs and language of the county, province, and the whole country that farmers must understand, such as names of people, places, organizations, etc. During the compilation, the related lessons are grouped into units according to the content. The front of each unit lists the new characters in that unit to facilitate teaching in classes that adopt the unit teaching method. Each lesson also includes exercises to cultivate students' reading and writing abilities, enabling them to practice making sentences and writing rural application documents using the learned characters and vocabulary.

In order to help students recognize characters, help them use dictionaries, and also to promote Mandarin Chinese, teachers from the Language Group of the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University enthusiastically helped to add phonetic symbols to this book.

The book has a total of 10 units and 29 lessons, with 540 new characters. According to the principle of from shallow to deep and from easy to difficult, each lesson has from 10 to 23 new characters. However, this book is compiled based on the "Work Point Literacy Textbook" in Sile Village, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province. The new characters in the first textbook compiled in each village are not completely the same. Therefore, some people may already be familiar with some of the characters in the new character list of this book; others may still find some characters that are not included in the new character list to be new characters, but the number of such characters is small. Assuming 540 new characters, it will take about 160 hours to teach the entire book.

After farmers finish reading this book, they will have completed the second step of literacy education. But they are still not able to read popular books and newspapers, and have not yet laid the foundation for self-study and improvement. Therefore, they still need to learn the third book. After learning the third book, they can reach the literacy standard, get rid of the illiteracy label, and become literate people. At that time, farmers can continue to attend spare-time primary schools, spare-time middle schools, or spare-time technical schools, and can learn more cultural and scientific knowledge to better serve the cause of socialist construction.

    昔阳县扫除文盲的第二本书
    方铁
    最近，团中央宣传部帮助山西省昔阳县教育局和青年团昔阳县委，编了“昔阳县农民识字课本”，也就是扫除文盲的第二本书。
    “记工识字课本”是扫除文盲的第一本书。编记工识字课本的目的，是为了农民念了它以后，能够记简单的工账。编第二本书的目的，是为了使农民能够记简单的家庭账，写简单的通知、便条和便信，也就是能够初步地利用文字工具来参与一乡一县或更大一点范围的社会生活。同时，还通过识字，使农民受到一些爱国主义和社会主义的思想教育。
    编这本书的方法，是从农民日常生活和社会生活最需要的字编起。选用的字主要有四个方面：一是庄稼活用的，有农业生产和农业科学技术方面的用字；二是日常生活用的，有柴、米、油、盐、酱、醋、茶、布等事务的用字；三是社会生活用的，这方面范围很广，“昔阳县农民识字课本”着重地选择了开会、上学、通知、写信、汇报工作等方面的常用字；四是农民必需了解的本县、本省和全国的事务和语言，如人名、地名、机关团体名等方面的用字。在编写的时候，根据内容把相近的课组成单元，每个单元的前面，列有本单元的生字，以便采用单元教学法的班级进行教学。在每课后面，还有练习，这是为了培养学员读和写的能力，使学员能够用学的字和词汇，练习造句和写农村应用文。
    为了帮助学员识字，帮助查字典，同时也为了推广普通话，北京师范大学中文系语言组的教师，还十分热情地帮助在这本书上加上了注音符号。
    这本书共有10个单元，29课，有生字540个。根据由浅到深、由易到难的原则，每课生字从10个到23个。但是，这本书是在山西省昔阳县下思乐村的“记工识字课本”的基础上编写的，各村编的第一本课本的生字不完全相同，因此，有些人对这本书的生字表中的一些生字，可能早已是熟字；有些人对没有列入生字表的字，也还会是生字，不过这类字的数目是不多的。这本书按540个生字来算，教完全书大约需要160小时。
    农民念完了这本书，就走完了识字教育的第二步。但是还不能够读通俗书报，还没有打下自学提高的基础，因此，还需要学第三本书。学了第三本书，就可以达到扫除文盲标准，摘掉文盲帽子，成为识字的人了。那时候，农民就可以继续上业余小学、业余中学或者业余技术学校了，就可以学习到更多的文化科学知识，更好地来为社会主义建设事业服务了。
