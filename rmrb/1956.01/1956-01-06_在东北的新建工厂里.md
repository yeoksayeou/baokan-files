　　In Newly Built Factories in Northeast China
    Fu Dong
    Recently I visited Northeast China and toured some newly built factories. After this trip, I have an even deeper understanding of how our motherland is advancing and leaping forward by leaps and bounds!
    I first arrived in Harbin and visited the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tools Plant. Looking at the milky white three-story factory building, I felt as if I were approaching a university classroom building.
    But when I stepped into the workshop, I realized that this was not like a school but rather a hospital. The spacious and bright workshop, the clean floors, the workers in their snow-white overalls working under microscopes, the instruments placed under glass covers – it was just like a hospital.
    The factory's Party Secretary led me to a large workshop. It was filled with various new-style metal cutting machine tools, looking like an ocean of machines from afar. Comrades from the factory said that the factory's machinery and equipment were all new-style, and most of the machine tools were automatic, semi-automatic, and specialized. Many machines were invented in the Soviet Union and were shipped to us before they were even used there.
    I went to the heat treatment workshop. Here I couldn't see any furnaces. Workers stood easily in front of instrument machines that looked like wardrobes, with automatic temperature controls. I stood there for a while and saw a worker put a steel part into the "wardrobe". A few seconds later, the steel part was "burned" bright red, just like a magic trick.
    I walked into the gauge block section, where the most precise gauges are manufactured. Comrades from the factory opened a small wooden box containing many steel blocks of various sizes and thicknesses. At first glance, these shiny little things didn't seem like much, but after an explanation, I realized that they were extremely precise measuring instruments, with a precision of 0.00007 millimeters. This means that when using it to measure something, the difference is only one-thousandth of the thickness of a newspaper. I remembered seeing workers in the past using micrometers to measure machine parts, so fine that even the eyes couldn't see clearly, which already seemed very strange. But now, the micrometer is nothing special in this factory's products!
    What impressed me most was the workshop that manufactures drill bits thinner than embroidery needles. When I went in, young women and men were grinding small drill bits with machines under microscopes magnified 160 times. Looking at the workers' sturdy working hands, I really wanted to show their hands to the people of the world. The nimble hands of Chinese workers can not only make exquisite ivory carvings and lacquerware... They can also manufacture the world's most advanced precision machinery!
    Leaving Harbin, I arrived in Changchun and visited the First Automobile Works.
    The car drove for tens of minutes on the wide and flat asphalt roads of Changchun city. Red two-story, three-story, and four-story buildings appeared outside the window. The driver Comrade introduced, "These are the workers' dormitories of the First Automobile Works." I tidied up my things to get out of the car, but strangely, the car kept moving forward. More than ten minutes passed, and the car was still running among these red buildings. After driving for more than ten kilometers, the car finally stopped in front of a row of tall and magnificent factory buildings.
    I had already heard a lot about this factory. When people talked about this factory, they always said with pride that we had built an "Automobile City" in just over two years. But I couldn't imagine how big this "city" was. Now, standing at the end of the central avenue of the automobile factory, looking at the four towering chimneys lined up side by side, the corridors架in the air, the thick black pipes, the water towers, and the distant red high-rise buildings, I understood why people called it "Automobile City".
    First, I went to the auxiliary workshop. It was tens of thousands of square meters in size, filled with machines. Overhead cranes moved back and forth in the workshop. Next to the brand-new machines, workers were working vigorously. The entire workshop resounded with activity. It was truly a delightful picture of labor.
    I will never forget the scene when I visited the thermal power plant. When I watched the blower roaring and spewing huge winds into the boiler tens of meters high, and the boiler burning fiercely, I suddenly felt that I had shrunk, become so small that I disappeared. I believe that everyone who sees that tall boiler, so high that you can't see the top, will cheer loudly from the bottom of their hearts like me. The strange thing was that I couldn't see many people next to such a large boiler. From the factory comrades, I learned that the operators sat in front of the control panel, and just by looking at the instruments on the control panel, they could clearly know the operation of each part of the boiler and control the operation of the boiler by flicking switches.
    Comrades from the factory invited me to see the general control room of the thermal power plant. I thought there must be many workers in the general control room, and the work there must be incredibly busy. But when I pushed open the door and saw the smooth floor and the marble-like walls, I felt like I was walking into a luxurious living room. There were only three or four people in the room, standing leisurely, and the whole room was quiet without any noise. Without the explanation of the comrades from the factory, I would never have believed that the few people standing there were standing in front of the main operating panel and distribution panel equipped with various electrical instruments. I would never have believed that they could fully understand the operation of the boiler and turbine by standing there. The comrades from the factory said humorously that if there was a problem with the boiler or turbine, the signal light would light up, and the signal bell would ring. The shift leader only had to give an order by telephone to solve the problem.
    I was so excited that I couldn't sleep that night. From the first time I saw a car, we had never seen a car with a Chinese license plate. Whether it was a large car or a small car, they all had foreign words written on them, such as "Ford" or "Dodge"... But now, this factory will soon be able to produce four-ton trucks. When I thought that a car with the words "Liberation" would be driven out of this factory every few minutes, when I thought of those beautifully painted cars carrying wood, steel bars, glass, and grain speeding on the highways in our country's cities and villages, when I thought of the embarrassing expressions of those imperialists who ridiculed us when we first started planning the automobile industry and said that China had no money and no technology to build an automobile factory, I just couldn't close my eyes.
    This time, I went to Anshan Iron and Steel again. It wasn't the first time I had visited the three major projects, but when I saw the workers open the iron outlet and the molten iron spurting golden-red fire like a red waterfall, I couldn't control the joy in my heart and almost shouted out. Similarly, when I stood in the seamless steel pipe plant and the large rolling mill, watching the red-hot steel billets automatically transferred from one process to another, and finally rolled into steel pipes or rails by themselves, I was equally excited. I have thought more than once: "Six years, in terms of time, it is not long, but what we have accomplished in these six years is much more than what capitalist countries have accomplished in decades."
    What I saw was only a small part of our great motherland's construction, but these things have never happened in our country's five thousand years of history. Let us make another effort to make our work "more, faster, better, and more economical," so that our country can enter socialism faster!

### 在东北的新建工厂里

　　在东北的新建工厂里
    傅冬
    最近我访问东北，参观了一些新建工厂。出去这么一走，更深刻地体会到我们祖国在一日千里地前进，在飞跃地前进！
    先到哈尔滨。访问了哈尔滨量具刃具厂。当我望着那乳白色的三层楼厂房，我觉得仿佛走到一个大学的课室大楼跟前。
    可是当我走进车间的时候，我却发觉这不像个学校，这像是一个医院。那宽敞明亮的车间，那洁净的地板，那穿着雪白工作服在显微镜下工作的工人，那放在玻璃罩下面的仪器，像医院一模一样。
    工厂的党委书记引我去看一个大车间。那里摆着各式各样的新式金属切削机床，远远看去，就像是机器的海洋。厂里的同志说，厂里的机器设备完全是新式的，机床多是自动半自动和专用的。有许多机器苏联才发明，还没有用过就给我们运来了。
    我去热处理车间。这里看不见炉子。工人轻松地站在像衣柜一样装有自动控制温度的仪表机器前，我在那儿站了一会，只见一个工人拿了个钢件放到“柜子”里面，几秒钟后，钢件就被“烧”得通红通红，简直和变戏法一样。
    我走进生产最精密量规的块规工段。厂里的同志打开一个小木盒，里面有许多大大小小厚薄不同的钢块。刚看见这亮晶晶的玩意儿，觉得没什么，经人一解释，才知道这是一些非常精密的测量仪器，它本身的精密度达到十万分之七公厘，也就是说用它量一件东西，只有一张报纸厚度的千分之一的差异。我想起以前在工厂里看见工人们用千分尺来量机器零件，细密的连眼睛都看不清楚，就已经觉得很奇怪，而现在，千分尺，在这个厂的产品里，已算不得什么稀奇了！
    给我印象最深的是制造比绣花针还细的钻头车间。当我进去的时候，那些年青的姑娘和小伙子正在放大160倍的显微镜下用机器磨制小的钻头。我望着工人结实的劳动的手，我真想把他们的手拿给全世界的人民看，中国工人的这双灵巧的手，不但能做精巧的象牙雕刻和漆器……他们还会制造世界上头等精密的机械！
    离开哈尔滨，到了长春。去参观第一汽车制造厂。
    汽车在长春市区宽阔平坦的柏油马路上行驶了几十分钟，窗外就出现了一幢幢红色的两层、三层、四层的楼房。司机同志介绍说：“这就是第一汽车制造厂的工人宿舍。”我整理整理了东西准备下车，可是奇怪，车子却一直不停地向前走。十几分钟过去了，车子还在这红色的楼房中间奔跑。足足走了十几公里，车子才在一排高大雄伟的场房前面停住了。
    关于这个工厂，我已听人介绍得不少了。人们谈起这个厂的时候，总是那么自豪地说，我们只用了两年多一点的时间就盖了个“汽车城”。可是我想像不出这个“城”怎么个大法。现在当我站在汽车厂中央大道的尽端，望着那四根并列的高耸入云的烟囱，望着那架在空中的走廊，望着那粗黑的管道、水塔、望着那远处鳞次栉比的红色的高楼……我才明白人们称它“汽车城”的道理了。
    先到了辅助工场。这儿有几万平方公尺大，里面摆的满满的都是机器。在场房的上空，天车来回的移动着。在崭新的机器旁工人们正生气勃勃地工作着。整个车间响成一片。这真是一幅令人愉快的劳动图画。
    我永远不会忘记参观热电站时的情景。当我望着鼓风机呼呼地向几十公尺高的锅炉里喷吐巨风，锅炉熊熊地燃烧时，我忽然觉得自己缩小了，小得没有了。我相信人人看到那高高的一眼望不到顶的锅炉，都会像我一样从心底里高声喝采的。奇怪的是在这样大的锅炉旁却看不见几个人。从厂里工作同志的口里，我才知道操作人员坐在操纵盘前，只要看着操纵盘上的仪表，就可以清楚地知道锅炉各部分运转的情形，就可拨动电钮控制锅炉的运行。
    厂里的工作同志邀我去看看热电站的总控制室。我想总控制室的工人一定很多，那里的工作一定忙得不可开交。可是当我推开了门，看见那光滑的地板，那像大理石一样的墙壁，我感到似乎走进个华丽的大客厅。屋里只有三、四个人，他们悠闲地站着，整个房子静悄悄地没有一点响声。如果没有厂里工作同志的解释，我绝对不会相信站在那里的几个人是站在装置着各种电气仪表的主操作盘和配电盘前。也绝对不会相信他们站在那儿就能够完全了解锅炉、透平机的运转情况。厂里的工作同志很有趣味地说，如果锅炉和透平机有了毛病，信号灯就会亮起来，信号铃也会叮叮地响起来，值班长只要用电话下个命令就把问题处理了。
    那一夜我兴奋得睡不着。从头一次看见汽车起，我们还没见过一辆有中国牌号的汽车，无论是大汽车小汽车，上面都是写的弯弯曲曲的外国字，什么“福特牌”、什么“道奇牌”……而现在这个厂马上就可以生产载重四吨的汽车了，当我想到几分钟就有一辆写着“解放”两字的汽车从这个工厂走出去，当我想到那些油漆得漂漂亮亮的汽车载着木材、钢筋、玻璃和谷物在我们祖国的城市和乡村的公路上风驰电掣地奔驰时，当我想到那些在我们刚开始筹办汽车工业时讥笑我们说中国没钱没技术办不了汽车工厂的帝国主义分子尴尬的神情时，我是怎样也阖不上眼。
    这一次我又去了一次鞍钢。参观三大工程不是头一次，可是当我看到工人打开铁口，铁水喷射着金红色的火光像红色的瀑布似的倾泻出来，我控制不住心头的喜悦，高兴得几乎叫出来。同样，当我站在无缝钢管厂和大型轧钢厂里，看到那通红炽热的钢胚自动地从这一道工序转到那一道工序，最后自己轧成钢管或钢轨时，我也同样的激动。我不止一次地想：“六年，拿时间计算，这并不算长，可是我们在这六年所完成的要比资本主义国家几十年完成的还要多得多。”
    我看到的只不过是我们伟大祖国建设中很小的一部分，但是这些是我们国家五千年来从来也没有过的。让我们再努一把力，把我们的工作搞得“又多、又快、又好、又省”，使我们的国家更快地进到社会主义！
