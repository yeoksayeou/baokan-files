The Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is now open. This meeting was originally scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1955, but due to the rapid development of the socialist transformation in the country, everyone was busy with work and could not easily find the time, so it was postponed until now. This also gives us the convenience of being able to summarize the experience of socialist transformation more easily.

In addition to the original 545 members, this meeting has 119 new members, and there are also 626 representatives from various sectors attending, totaling 1,290 people. This fact shows that as the socialist cause advances, our country's people's democratic united front is even broader and stronger than before. People from all walks of life across the country, seeing the prosperity of our great motherland, have shown unprecedented patriotism, unprecedented political enthusiasm, and unity. This is a worthy scene to celebrate. Relying on the unity and struggle of the people of all nationalities and all walks of life across the country, the various undertakings of our motherland will definitely proceed more smoothly and more rapidly. (Applause)

Our meeting has six reports. My political report will first discuss the current international situation, and regarding domestic issues, I will focus on several aspects that are of greatest concern to everyone.

As for the international situation, the past year has been a year of easing international tensions.

In the years following the end of World War II, the forces of international peace and the forces of international war have engaged in sharp and repeated struggles. The forces of international peace have increasingly taken the initiative, and the ranks of those defending world peace have grown and strengthened. In this ranks, there are the socialist countries led by the Soviet Union, as well as the peace-loving peoples and countries of the world. Since last year, the spirit of Bandung, which advocates peaceful coexistence and opposes colonialism, and the spirit of Geneva, which advocates easing international tensions and resolving international disputes through consultation, have gained increasing support among the peoples of the world. On the other hand, the so-called "strength" policy of the American aggression group and its followers, which is actually a policy of threatening and blackmailing with war, has repeatedly suffered setbacks, making them increasingly passive. In general, the current international situation is favorable for world peace, favorable for our socialist construction, and unfavorable for the war plans and aggressive policies of the aggression group.

After World War II, the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union was formed. Over the past decade, the countries of the socialist camp have made rapid progress in all aspects of their construction, continuously strengthening and consolidating their forces. The countries of the socialist camp, with a population of nine hundred million, connected in a vast expanse across the continents of Europe and Asia, are in a superior position to be able to support each other in any situation, and have established sincere cooperation and brotherly friendly relations among themselves. In contrast to the thriving and rapid development of the socialist camp and the increasingly consolidated internal unity, the imperialist camp led by the American aggression group is often plagued by crises, with internal contradictions becoming increasingly sharp. The brilliant achievements of the socialist countries in their construction and their consistent policy of peaceful coexistence have won the broad welcome and support of the peace-loving peoples of the world. Our socialist countries' friendly relations with all countries that want to maintain peace are also developing. On the other hand, the aggressive policies and war preparations of the imperialist aggression group have met with increasingly resolute resistance from the peoples of various countries who love peace, making them increasingly isolated in the world.

However, the American aggression group and its followers do not acknowledge all these changes that have taken place in the world. In order to pursue the maximum profits of monopoly capital and seize world hegemony, they still insist on their aggressive policies and war policies. To cover up the essence of these policies, the American aggression group and its followers repeatedly fabricate a series of lies about the so-called communist threat to intimidate and deceive.

No matter how the American aggression group fabricates lies, the peoples of various countries know that the countries that have waged wars in the past and are still preparing for new wars are not the socialist countries, but the imperialist countries. The socialist countries have consistently pursued a policy of peace and have been working to consolidate peace, ease international tensions, and develop friendly cooperation among countries. Everyone knows that our socialist countries firmly advocate universal arms reduction and the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. On this issue, in order to reach an international agreement, the Soviet Union has made sincere efforts and, together with all the people's democratic countries, has taken practical actions; but the American aggression group and its followers have not only not made corresponding efforts, but have retreated from their original disarmament positions to obstruct reaching an agreement on the disarmament issue. The socialist countries firmly oppose aggressive military alliances and advocate a system of collective security and collective peace that does not exclude any country to guarantee the security and peace of all countries. However, the American aggression group and its followers are enthusiastically organizing exclusive, aggressive military alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty, the Western European Union, the Manila Treaty, and the Baghdad Treaty, and are widely establishing and expanding military bases on the territory of other countries. The socialist countries have consistently advocated the peaceful resolution of international disputes, but the American aggression group is pursuing a policy of intimidation and blackmail on the "brink of war." Facts speak louder than words, and any fair-minded person can see who wants war and who wants peace.

The American aggression group is blatantly engaged in subversive activities against many countries, threatening the security of many countries. This fact, which was originally not understood by many people, is now understood. The American aggression group has never stopped its subversive and destructive activities against the socialist countries. It still boasts of its bloodthirsty so-called "liberation" policy, attempting to impose on the peoples of the people's democratic countries the corrupt social system that they have already overthrown and the reactionary figures who are thoroughly reactionary. The American aggression group has not only not acknowledged the choice made by the Chinese people, but also openly interferes in China's internal affairs, using force and the threat of force to violate China's territorial sovereignty and attempt to obstruct the Chinese people's completion of the cause of national reunification. For all countries in Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and other regions of the world that demand the maintenance of sovereignty and independence, including the allied countries of the United States, the American aggression group has never hesitated to use the means of creating division and armed coups to engage in subversive and destructive activities. The facts are such, but the American aggression group does not hesitate to reverse right and wrong and accuse the socialist countries of subversive activities. Such lies cannot change the facts. We believe in the superiority of the socialist system. However, we have always believed that revolution cannot be exported. We advocate peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between countries with different social systems, allowing the peoples of each country to choose their own political, economic systems, and ways of life. We firmly oppose the use of force or any other means to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and obstruct the choice of other peoples. The Five Principles of Mutual Respect for Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity, Mutual Non-Aggression, Non-Interference in Internal Affairs, Equality and Mutual Benefit, and Peaceful Coexistence, jointly proposed by China, India, and Burma and supported by the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and many other countries, are an embodiment of our advocacy.

The whole world has seen that the American aggression group not only strives to support the collapsing colonial system, but it itself is the largest colonialist in the world today. It strives to expand its colonial rule through the establishment of a global network of military bases, military alliances, and so-called aid to backward regions, establishing world hegemony. The United States openly calls Goa of India and Macao of China "provinces" of Portugal. The United States has consistently opposed the right of self-determination for colonial peoples in the United Nations. The American aggression group has become the main pillar of colonial rule in the world. However, the American aggression group and its followers dare to say that socialism is "a form of colonialism." The socialist system is a system without exploitation of man by man, which is fundamentally different from a system in which one country enslaves and plunders another. The socialist countries have consistently supported the struggles of all oppressed peoples and firmly opposed all forms of colonialism. For more than 30 years, the Soviet Union has always been the most loyal and strongest supporter of the oppressed peoples of the world. Recently, when the Soviet Union's state leaders visited India, Burma, and Afghanistan, they vividly expressed the Soviet Union's boundless sympathy and support for all peoples and countries striving for and safeguarding national independence. We socialist countries believe that all peoples and all countries in the world, regardless of size, should be equal, with no distinction between superior and inferior; all peoples should have the right to self-determination and should not be enslaved and plundered by any other country. China and some other socialist countries have historically been in the position of colonies and semi-colonies, and it was in the struggle against colonialism that they gained independence. Those who have thrown off colonial rule are not only socialist countries, but also countries led by nationalists. In the future, there will inevitably be more oppressed peoples and countries that, based on the paths they have chosen, will throw off colonial rule. This is the inevitable trend of historical development, which no force can stop.

The American aggression group has consistently used so-called aid to backward countries to enslave and exploit. It uses "aid" as a pretext to dump surplus goods, thereby seizing the markets of other countries and destroying their economies. It keeps backward countries in the position of supplying raw materials and markets for industrial products so that it can enslave and exploit them. Through so-called "aid," it demands that the recipient countries cede military bases and undertake military, political, and economic obligations that are unfavorable to them, and demands supervision of the use of "aid" to control the recipient countries. All of these are not secrets. In contrast to the American aggression group, the policy that socialist countries implement when they assist each other or engage in economic cooperation with other countries is first and foremost mutual exchange. We do not force other countries to accept goods that they do not need or that they can produce sufficiently on their own. Another feature of our policy is to help economically underdeveloped countries develop their own industries and achieve economic independence. We do not demand any privileges from the assisted countries. Whether the assistance we provide is economic or technological, our guiding principles are always mutual benefit and non-interference in internal affairs.

The facts are already clear. The American aggression group, under the banner of opposing communism, fabricates a series of lies, all to cover up its own preparations for war and aggression. There is no doubt that the American aggression group wants to direct its war spearhead at the socialist countries. However, due to the strength of the socialist countries, the American aggression group has used all means, including armed intervention and subversive activities, and after many confrontations, has not gained any advantage, but has suffered serious setbacks. Therefore, the American aggression group is actually, under the pretext of opposing communism, first expanding in regions where its forces can penetrate, invading the sovereignty and national interests of the countries in these regions, and using various means to carry out colonialist enslavement and plundering. This cannot but cause the peoples of these regions to rise up to resist this war policy and aggressive policy. The strength of the socialist camp and the influence of the peaceful policy of this camp, together with the role played by many independent national states in adhering to a policy of peace and neutrality, have more powerfully inspired their struggles. The development of these struggles has made the American aggression group increasingly trapped in a dilemma.

The burgeoning national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America have shaken colonial rule in these regions and effectively hindered the implementation of the policies of the American aggression group in these regions. In Southeast Asia, countries such as India, Burma, Indonesia, and Afghanistan have already freed themselves from the status of colonies and embarked on the path of independent development. These countries cherish the national independence they have already achieved and are determined to defend their independence and sovereignty. They condemn hostile military alliances, oppose war threats, and insist on a neutral position, demanding peaceful coexistence among all countries. These countries, especially the great power of India, are playing an increasingly active role in the peaceful resolution of many major international issues. We deeply respect the positions of these countries. We have already established friendly relations with them based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, and we are cooperating with these countries in many ways in the struggle for peace and international security. In Africa and the Middle East, the Arab countries led by Egypt are firmly defending their national independence and bravely resisting the activities of the imperialist aggression group to undermine the sovereignty of the Arab countries and divide the Arab countries. Recently, the struggle of the Jordanian people against the Baghdad Pact has won the sympathy and support of the broad masses of the world. We are pleased to see that Sudan has declared independence and joined the ranks of the Arab countries to engage in joint struggle. We also hope to see the national self-determination wishes of the peoples of North Africa realized. During the Asian-African Conference, we established friendly contacts with some countries in Africa and the Middle East. Now, our relations with them have further developed. We sympathize with and support all the peoples and countries in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America who are struggling for and safeguarding national independence. Their struggles are just, and no force in the world can stop their victory. Their victory will strengthen the forces of peace and strike a blow to the forces of war.

In these regions, there are still some countries that fantasize about gaining benefits from joining aggressive military alliances or following the aggressive policies of the United States. However, the facts show that joining aggressive military alliances and helping imperialism create divisions in these regions will ultimately make oneself a victim of imperialism's divide-and-rule strategy. Those who tie their national interests to the war chariot of the American aggression group and follow the aggressive policies of the United States cannot guarantee their national independence but will only make themselves more dependent politically and economically. They cannot make themselves rich and strong but will only make themselves more impoverished and weak. The peoples and far-sighted politicians of these countries are increasingly strongly demanding to take another path, that is, to break free from the current predicament of being bound, and together with the other countries in these regions, to strive jointly for peace, safeguard national independence, and develop friendly cooperation among countries. We have the wish to be friendly with these countries. We are pleased to see that the connections between the peoples of China and Thailand, which were once interrupted, have recently begun to be restored. We are willing to contact the leaders and peoples of all these countries based on the spirit of Bandung to eliminate any possible misunderstandings.

The rearmament of West Germany and Japan is an important part of the American aggression group's war preparations. However, the German people and the Japanese people, who were once dragged into war disasters by their own militarists, are increasingly resolute in their opposition to being rearmed to fight for the American aggression group. The German people have already seen that the American aggression group's policy of rearming West Germany not only threatens the peace and security of the German people and the peoples of Europe but also obstructs German reunification and keeps West Germany in a subordinate position for a long time. In the German Democratic Republic, the German people have already organized their democratic and peace-loving forces in the form of a state to struggle for the peaceful democratic reunification of Germany. In West Germany, the forces opposing rearmament and advocating peaceful reunification are also growing. We have always believed that the issue of German reunification should be resolved by the German people themselves in a manner that serves the national interests of the German people and the security of Europe. China has already formed an unbreakable friendship with the German Democratic Republic. For the peace and reunification of Germany as a peace-loving democratic country, China also welcomes the normalization of relations with the Federal Republic of Germany.

The war has been over for ten years, but Japan is still under American occupation, bound by various unequal treaties and agreements of subjugation. The American military bases and facilities are scattered throughout Japan. The American embargo policy hinders Japan's normal trade with other countries, making Japan's economy even more difficult. The independent Japanese nation is now subjected to American interference and control in all aspects. This situation has made the Japanese people increasingly intolerable. In recent times, the movement to break free from foreign control in Japan has grown tremendously. The Japanese people and far-sighted politicians are increasingly advocating an independent and autonomous policy, opposing the pursuit and subordination to the American aggression group, opposing foreign military bases, advocating the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and advocating the expansion of ties with all countries in the world, especially the normalization of Sino-Japanese and Soviet-Japanese relations. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with Japan's difficult situation and fully support the Japanese people's desire for independence. We have developed political, economic, and cultural ties with the Japanese people. Based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, we have always been working to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. The Chinese government made two proposals to the Japanese government on August 17 and November 4 last year to discuss the issue of promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. We regret that we have not yet received a response from the Japanese government. Promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations is an urgent demand of the two peoples. The Chinese government once again proposes that the two governments discuss this issue. We hope that Japan will implement an independent and autonomous foreign policy. We welcome Japan to return to the family of Asian countries and live in peace and friendship with Asian and world countries.

The war preparations and expansion policies of the American aggression group seriously harm the interests of its Western allies. These countries, due to their participation in the military alliances controlled by the United States, cannot but bear military expenses that they are not up to, causing increasingly great economic difficulties. At the same time, the American embargo policy seriously hinders their normal international trade. This deepens their dependence on the United States. If they originally hoped to preserve their vested interests in colonies and spheres of influence by allying with the United States, then they should have already discovered that the American aggression group is using this alliance to seize their vested interests. The broad masses of the people in the allied countries of the United States can no longer tolerate their countries following the policies of the American aggression group and have already expressed their resistance through actions. The recent results of the French elections are a vivid example of this. In the ruling classes of these countries, there are also increasingly more people demanding the implementation of an independent and autonomous policy. Obviously, the trend of many capitalist countries demanding to break free from American control will continue to develop. This trend is in the interests of the peoples of the relevant countries and is also conducive to world peace. The neutral positions of Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland have brought more and more benefits to their peoples, attracting other capitalist countries. Austria's decision to maintain permanent neutrality has opened the way for Austria's peaceful development. We respect Austria's neutral position and would like to see a peaceful cooperative relationship between China and Austria established.

The war preparations and expansion policies of the American aggression group have also caused increasing dissatisfaction and opposition within the United States. The broad masses of the people are concerned about the war threats brought by the "strength" policy. Their living conditions are deteriorating, and their democratic freedoms are being deprived. To improve living conditions, defend democracy and freedom, and strive for peace and oppose war, the American people have launched extensive struggles. This situation cannot but have an impact on the American ruling class. Within the American ruling class, there are also some more far-sighted people who gradually realize that using war and the threat of war, advocating the "brink of war," and continuing to implement the rigid policy of relying on "strength" can only make the United States more isolated. Therefore, they demand that a more sober policy be adopted on the basis of recognizing reality. In the American business community, there are also many people who are dissatisfied with the American embargo policy and demand the development of normal international trade. All of these are welcome. The Chinese people firmly oppose the policy of war preparations and expansion implemented by the American aggression group and the aggressive policy of obstructing the complete unification of our country and antagonizing the Chinese people, but we have never been hostile to the American people and do not deny any actions of the American government that are conducive to easing international tensions. We are willing to live in friendship with the American people. We are also willing to improve relations with the United States.

Under the strong pressure of the peoples of the world and all sides, the American government sometimes cannot but take some actions that are objectively conducive to easing international tensions. However, the American aggression group is unwilling to see the real easing of tensions. It fears that the easing of international tensions will reduce the profits that war preparations bring to monopoly capital, and it fears that the easing of international tensions will make it lose control over other countries. Therefore, after each easing of international tensions, it intensifies the creation of tensions to obstruct the further easing of the situation. This has formed a repeated struggle between the world peoples demanding easing and the American aggression group creating tensions. Because the peoples of the world have become increasingly aware of this conspiracy to repeatedly create tensions to intimidate and blackmail, the American aggression group suffers new failures after each creation of tensions and falls into greater passivity.

The fact that the American aggression group fears easing and creates tensions is clearly reflected in the recent remarks of American Secretary of State Dulles. The peoples of the world all demand the further easing of international tensions, but the American Secretary of State openly boasts of the "brink of war" policy and even boasts of how this intimidation policy has been effective in Korea, Indochina, and the Taiwan region. People with healthy memories know that the realization of the Korean armistice was precisely the result of the military blows dealt by the Chinese and North Korean peoples to the aggressors and the strong moral pressure exerted by the peace-loving peoples of the world on the aggressors. After the Korean armistice, the American aggression group attempted to create a new tense situation by expanding the war in Indochina. However, the great victory of the liberation of Dien Bien Phu by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam shattered the American aggression group's war blackmail, and the American war policy did not prevent the restoration of peace in Indochina but made the United States fall into complete isolation. After the fires of Indochina were extinguished, the American aggression group, through so-called congressional resolutions and the so-called "U.S.-Chiang joint defense treaty," openly threatened with force to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the offshore islands, to maintain and intensify the tense situation caused by the American occupation of Taiwan. However, the result was not that the Chinese people were intimidated, but that the Chinese people liberated the island of Jianshan, forcing the Chiang Kai-shek group to withdraw from Dachen and Nanji. This completely exposed the American aggression group's war blackmail. The American aggression group, unwilling to accept this series of failures, continues to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, sabotage the implementation of the Geneva Agreement in Indochina, intensify military activities in the Taiwan region, and strive to maintain the tense situation in the Far East, continuing to implement the so-called "brink of war" policy. However, the unanimous condemnation of the peoples of the world, including the American people, of the American Secretary of State's intimidating rhetoric, eloquently proves the failure of the American aggression group's war blackmail policy.

We believe that the policy of war blackmail cannot solve any problem, and the unresolved issues in Asia and the world should still be resolved through consultation. The relevant countries should continue to take measures to further ease international tensions.

China has already proposed and still advocates the convening of a Far East conference with the participation of many Asian countries to consult on the resolution of the problem of the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The Geneva Agreement's provisions on consultations for national elections in Vietnam have been unreasonably sabotaged, and the work of the International Commission for Vietnam has been violently obstructed. Allowing this situation to continue will have extremely serious consequences. China proposes to reconvene the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue, guarantee the implementation of the Geneva Agreement in Vietnam, and believes that this conference should invite the three countries of the International Commission for Vietnam—India, Poland, and Canada—to participate.

Regarding the easing and elimination of the tense situation in the Taiwan region, I would like to talk about the Sino-American ambassadorial-level talks that have been held in Geneva since August 1, 1955.

The first item on the agenda of the Sino-American ambassadorial-level talks is the repatriation of civilians from both sides. China has taken a problem-solving attitude towards this issue from the beginning and has faithfully fulfilled the agreement after it was reached. However, even after the agreement was reached, the American government has not abandoned its various threats and persecutions to obstruct the return of Chinese emigrants to their homeland. The American government forces them to apply as "political refugees," apply for "permanent residence" in the United States, and even requires them to obtain "Taiwan entry permits," attempting to completely deprive them of their right to return to their homeland.

This serious violation of the agreement by the United States is unacceptable. All Chinese people in the United States, even if they are forced to apply as "political refugees," forced to apply for "permanent residence" in the United States, or forced to obtain "Taiwan entry permits," their right to return to their homeland should not be affected in any way. If they encounter any obstacles when returning to their homeland, they have the right to request assistance from the Chinese government or the Indian Embassy in the United States. If the American government continues to threaten and persecute them, it must bear the full responsibility for violating the agreement.

The second item on the agenda of the Sino-American ambassadorial-level talks is other practical issues that are in dispute between the two sides. Under this item, China has raised the issue of the embargo and the preparation for higher-level Sino-American talks. The United States has refused to engage in substantive discussions on these two issues but has demanded the issuance of a joint statement by the United States and China on the renunciation of the use of force. China is not opposed to issuing this statement. In fact, China has consistently advocated the resolution of disputes between China and the United States through consultation rather than resorting to force. However, since the United States has already used force to occupy China's Taiwan, the joint statement by the United States and China on the renunciation of the use of force must lead to the removal of the force that the United States has already used, and it is not allowed to legalize the United States' occupation of Taiwan.

The Chinese government believes that to realize the principle of non-use of force between China and the United States, a Sino-American foreign ministers' conference should be held to resolve and ease the tense situation in the Taiwan region.

However, the attitude expressed by the United States in the talks shows that its purpose in raising the issue of the renunciation of the use of force is not to ease and eliminate the tense situation in the Taiwan region but to continue and intensify the tense situation in the Taiwan region. In the draft joint statement proposed by the United States, it even mentions that the United States wants to exercise so-called individual or collective self-defense rights on China's territory of Taiwan. Taiwan is China's territory, and only China can exercise the right of self-defense on Taiwan. The purpose of the United States is obviously to continue to maintain the force that it has already used on Taiwan under the pretext of "self-defense rights," and at the same time, it attempts to make China acknowledge the legalization of the United States' occupation of Taiwan, so as to continue to use the Chiang Kai-shek group to create a so-called "two Chinas" situation. This purpose of the United States is one that China cannot agree to under any circumstances. China's position is very clear: China is willing to continue to strive for an agreement through talks, but China cannot agree to the talks being dragged on indefinitely, making it impossible to resolve the tense situation in the Taiwan region.

To achieve collective peace in the Asia-Pacific region, the Chinese government is willing to reaffirm its proposal made on July 30, 1955, that the countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including the United States, should sign a collective peace treaty to replace the current opposing military alliances in this region. China is willing to work with all relevant countries to realize this proposal.

Here, it is particularly necessary to mention that the Soviet government recently proposed to the American government to sign a Soviet-American friendship and cooperation treaty. This is another great effort by the Soviet Union, following the Geneva summit of the four governments, to ease international tensions. China fully supports this proposal by the Soviet Union. It is regrettable that the American authorities quickly rejected the Soviet proposal. The improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States is closely related to world peace. The new proposal by the Soviet Union for this purpose fully meets the urgent demands of the broad masses of the world and is not something that can be easily rejected.

Comrades and friends! The current trend of easing international tensions is something that the American aggression group cannot stop. However, we should also see that the American policy of intensifying international tensions has not changed, and it still insists on its so-called "strength" policy and continues to intensify war preparations. Therefore, while we strive to continue to ease international tensions, we must also consider the possibility of the American aggression group engaging in war adventures. For this, we must continue to strengthen our national defense and build up our strength. Here, the decisive factor is to accelerate the socialist transformation and construction and to complete and exceed the targets of the first five-year plan ahead of schedule. At the same time, we must further develop and consolidate the unity and cooperation within the socialist camp. The eight-nation Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance signed by the Soviet Union and the European people's democratic countries in Warsaw in May last year, and the recent meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the signatory countries of this treaty in Prague, have great significance for strengthening their unity, maintaining their own security, and European peace. The Chinese people will always stand with the Soviet Union and all the people's democratic countries. No force can destroy our unity and friendship. We must also strengthen our unity with all peace-loving countries and peoples, develop friendly exchanges and various ties with countries around the world, actively support the world peace movement, and resolutely fight against the aggressive and war policies of the United States. (The entire hall erupted in thunderous applause)

We believe that in the situation where the countries of the socialist camp are becoming increasingly strong and the peoples of the world are increasingly taking the cause of defending peace into their own hands, the war adventures of the aggression group can be stopped. On the other hand, it should also be pointed out that we demand peace, but if the international aggression group forces war upon us, we are not afraid of war. The two world wars did not bring any benefits to the countries that started them. The result of the First World War was the emergence of the first socialist country in the world; the result of the Second World War was the emergence of a series of socialist countries in Europe and Asia and many countries led by nationalists. If the aggression group dares to launch a third world war, then it can be said that the failure will not be just one or two imperialist countries, but the entire imperialist system. (Applause) The lessons of history and the current reality should make the warmongers sober up. War and the threat of war will never frighten the Chinese people. (Applause) The Chinese people will unswervingly strive to continue to ease international tensions and consolidate world peace.

Regarding the current domestic situation of our country, its characteristics, as Chairman Mao Zedong said, are that it is "in the midst of a great socialist revolution." (Applause)

The people of the whole country are striding towards socialism, and everywhere there is a scene of joy and excitement. (Applause) Tens of millions of farmers across the country are taking action, responding to the call of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, implementing agricultural cooperation, and launching a high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture. (Applause) The socialist transformation of handicrafts and the full public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce are also following suit. (Applause) In major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Chongqing, Xi'an, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, the full public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce, the full cooperation of handicrafts, and the cooperation of the entire suburban agriculture have been successively realized. (Applause) The third-year task of China's first five-year plan for national economic development has been successfully completed. (Applause) In the midst of the socialist revolution across the country, the labor enthusiasm of the working class in our country is unprecedentedly high. The working masses across the country are conducting extensive socialist competitions to overfulfill the 1956 plan and complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule. (The entire hall erupted in thunderous applause) At the same time, the struggle to thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionaries is being carried out step by step within institutions and in society. (Applause) The movement to study Marxism-Leninism is also developing extensively. (Applause) All of these reflect that the socialist enthusiasm of the people across the country is unprecedentedly high. (Applause) We have reason to believe that China's first five-year plan for national economic development will be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled, and our country will also gain more reliable guarantees in completing the overall tasks of the transitional period. (The entire hall erupted in thunderous applause)

Title: The Great Leap Forward in the Socialist Transformation of China's Agriculture, Handicrafts, and Capitalist Industry and Commerce
Author:
Date: 1956-02-28
Page: 1

It is now clear that the socialist transformation of agriculture can be completed ahead of schedule. By the end of December 1955, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives nationwide had increased to over 1.9 million, with more than 70 million households joining, accounting for over 60% of the total number of households nationwide. By the end of 1956, the semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization can be basically completed. Then, after another two years, by 1958, the fully socialist agricultural cooperativization can be basically completed. (Lively applause)

The socialist transformation of China's agriculture has a relatively long history. It has gone through three stages of development. Even before the founding of the People's Republic of China, in many revolutionary base areas, a large number of mutual aid teams with socialist germs emerged, and in some areas, semi-socialist and fully socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives had already emerged. Currently, China's agricultural producers' cooperatives are still in their primary form and in the transition from the primary form to the advanced form, while most mutual aid teams have already entered the primary cooperatives. It is easy to understand that the transition of agricultural producers' cooperatives from primary to advanced is an inevitable trend. As long as the main conditions for upgrading, as stipulated in the draft of the national agricultural development outline, are met, farmers will naturally demand a change in the semi-private ownership of means of production to further liberate productive forces and achieve greater and faster development of production.

Facing the high tide of national agricultural cooperativization and the high tide of national agricultural production it is bringing about, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed a draft outline for the development of national agriculture from 1956 to 1967, seeking opinions from all levels of party organizations and workers, peasants, scientists, and patriotic figures from all walks of life.

There may be two concerns about this draft: some may think that the indicators set by the draft are too conservative and worry that it will restrain farmers' enthusiasm for increased production; others may think that the tasks proposed by the draft are too demanding and worry that the burden on farmers will be too heavy. I think the first concern is unnecessary because this draft is the minimum program for our current agricultural development; if, in practice, due to the overall development of the national economy and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, the plan is completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled, that is exactly the goal we are striving for.

Regarding the second concern, we can simply examine the strength of the farmers. Currently, there are nearly 120 million peasant households nationwide. If each household is counted as one and a half laborers, there are 180 million laborers nationwide. According to the requirements of the agricultural development outline, if each male laborer works 250 days a year and each female laborer works 120 days a year, each household would have 370 workdays a year, and the country would have 44.4 billion workdays a year. Farmers' direct labor in the fields accounts for about two-thirds of their total workdays. Thus, farmers nationwide still have 14.8 billion workdays a year that can be used for various measures to increase production and for political, economic, cultural, educational, and health work. At the same time, with the development of agricultural production, the income of cooperative farmers will greatly increase, and the public accumulation of cooperatives will continue to expand, making it possible to invest part of the funds in agricultural infrastructure and create conditions for expanded reproduction. Under the conditions of the rapid development of agricultural cooperatives nationwide and increased agricultural production, if each male and female laborer can achieve the number of workdays stipulated in the agricultural development outline, then each household can have an income of 30 to 60 yuan per month. Therefore, the source of funds will not be a problem.

Of course, to fully realize this agricultural development outline, a lot of scientific research work must be done, and the joint efforts and coordination of all sectors of the country are needed. We believe that all of you present will not hesitate to contribute your strength in the struggle to complete this great task. (Lively applause)

The high tide of the socialist transformation of China's handicraft industry has also arrived. By the end of December 1955, there were over 70,000 handicraft cooperatives nationwide, with more than 2 million members, accounting for about 25% of the 7.85 million handicraft workers. After another two years, by 1957, the socialist transformation of handicrafts can be basically completed.

China's handicraft industry is very developed and plays an important role in the national economy. They are powerful assistants to modern industry and play an active role in serving the needs of the state and the people. The production of handicrafts is more concentrated than agriculture, with a higher commodity rate, making it easier to change the ownership system. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of handicraft workers to take the socialist road is also very high. Therefore, the time for completing the socialist transformation and technological transformation of handicrafts may and should be slightly faster than that of agriculture.

At the same time, we must also pay attention to the fact that China's handicraft industry has the characteristics of dispersed operations, wide distribution, complex industries, generally backward technology, and different socio-economic natures. Therefore, when formulating a comprehensive plan for socialist transformation and technological transformation, we must not only make the scale and speed of the transformation of handicrafts compatible with the scale and speed of the transformation of agriculture and capitalist industry and commerce, but more importantly, we must grasp the various complex situations of handicrafts and correctly implement the policy of socialist transformation of handicrafts. After the handicraft workers are organized, we must make full use of local raw materials, utilize waste materials, increase product varieties, improve product quality, reduce production costs, and produce more and better products that meet the needs of the state and the people. We should pay attention to maintaining the past advantages of handicraft workers who are very concerned about the quality and market sales of their own products. After cooperativization, those that are not suitable for collective production should maintain the form of dispersed production. For the products of handicrafts, the state can only process and order those that are suitable for state purchase, and most products should still be sold by handicraft cooperatives or handicraft workers based on their original market connections and new market needs. We should also pay attention to the special nature and historical traditions of some handicrafts in the field of handicrafts. After cooperativization, we must improve their craftsmanship and preserve and carry forward their excellent historical traditions. Some special handicrafts and handicraft industries, if they are not easy to organize cooperatives for the time being, should be allowed to operate individually; if they have difficulty adjusting after joining the cooperative, they should be left unchanged until the situation is clarified and then adjusted. In short, after the transformation of handicrafts, the varieties should only increase and not decrease; the goods should only be better and not worse; the technology should only be improved and not lowered. At the same time, we should pay more attention to including the supply, production, and sales plans of handicrafts as much as possible in the national, and primarily local, industrial plans to prevent production disruptions due to the transformation. Only in this way can we actively play the role of handicrafts as assistants to modern industry and demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system. (Applause)

Under the influence of the rapid development of agricultural cooperativization, the socialist transformation of China's capitalist industry and commerce has also entered a new stage, that is, the stage of implementing full public-private joint operations in all private enterprises in various regions. By the end of December 1955, more than half of the large-scale capitalist industry, in terms of output value, had already implemented public-private joint operations; about 30% of capitalist commerce, in terms of business volume, had already implemented public-private joint operations. In 1956, a high tide of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce swept through all large and medium-sized cities nationwide.

The implementation of full public-private joint operations in all private enterprises is a higher form of state capitalism and a decisive step for the transition from capitalist ownership to socialist ownership. Since the founding of our country, various forms of state capitalism have been adopted to transform capitalist industry and commerce into socialism. However, most of these transformations are still in the form of primary state capitalism, such as processing, ordering, unified purchasing, packaging, selling, and consignment selling, etc., which have not greatly changed the capitalist production relations. With the planned development of the national economy and the promotion of the superiority of the socialist economy, the contradictions between the productive forces and production relations in capitalist enterprises have been particularly exposed. Now, by implementing full public-private joint operations in various industries, the state, according to the national economic plan and the socialist management methods, carries out planned enterprise reforms, and mainly adopts the method of fixed dividends to handle the capitalist ownership of means of production. In this way, the capitalist production relations have basically changed, leaving only the payment of a certain amount of dividends to the capitalists.

The reason why Chinese national industrialists and businessmen can so enthusiastically accept the socialist transformation is that the policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the state has played a decisive role. The people's government has vigorously and preferentially developed the socialist economy and cooperative economy, while taking a series of steps to gradually transform the capitalist economy into a state-capitalist economy that is managed by the state, led by the state-owned economy, and supervised by the working class. With the prosperity of the socialist economy, the supervision of the working-class masses within private enterprises who actively demand the realization of socialism, and the rapid development of the socialist transformation of agriculture, national industrialists and businessmen have increasingly realized that it is impossible to take the capitalist road in China and that they can only accept the transformation and, through peaceful transformation, take the socialist road. The socialist transformation plan for capitalist industry and commerce adopted by our country is also acceptable to national industrialists and businessmen because, in handling the capitalist ownership, the state still gives these industrialists and businessmen a certain period of dividends, and in the full public-private joint operations in the entire industry, a comprehensive personnel arrangement is also carried out. In this way, national industrialists and businessmen see that, after the complete elimination of capitalist ownership in the future, their work and life will be fully guaranteed. Politically, our country not only gives national industrialists and businessmen the right to vote but also actively conducts ideological education for them, making them understand that they must follow the laws of social development to grasp their own destiny and help them voluntarily carry out self-reform to become laborers tomorrow from today's exploiters. (Lively applause)

It should be pointed out that the current high tide of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce nationwide is only the beginning of further in-depth transformation. In addition to large-scale private industrial and commercial households, China has tens of thousands of medium and small-scale industrial and commercial households. In such a short period, only the legal approval of public-private joint operations can be obtained first. After the joint operation, there are still a series of tasks to be seriously carried out and completed, such as asset verification, economic reorganization, enterprise reform, production arrangement, and personnel arrangement. In carrying out these tasks, we must be particularly careful not to easily change the original management methods of enterprises and must be good at preserving the good experiences in the original management methods as historical heritage to be inherited and carried forward. For the extremely large number of small shops, after the joint operation, the method of consignment and commission should be continued. Consignment can also be used as a form of public-private joint operation because its source of goods is mainly supplied by the state, the purchase and sale plan is approved by the state, the enterprise is led by a specialized company, and the commission is similar to the piecework wage system in socialist enterprises. For those scattered street vendors, do not rush to change their operating methods because this operating method is convenient for the people and is welcomed by the people and should be retained for a long period. In short, the basic purpose of our transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is to change the production relations and liberate the productive forces. Its ultimate manifestation is the development and improvement of production. Therefore, in the process of implementing joint operations, the most important issue is to ensure the normal operation of production and business and absolutely not to allow chaos in production and operation, causing losses to the national and social wealth. The staff, engineering and technical personnel, and businessmen of joint-venture enterprises must pay attention to maintaining the original good varieties, goods, and quality, and absolutely not allow the merging of factories and stores and the adjustment of commercial networks without the approval of the leading organs, and the easy change of service and personnel systems. Under the unified leadership and arrangement of the central and local governments, reform work in various aspects should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner to ensure that the socialist transformation work can continue to develop healthily. We hope that the relevant delegates present will explain these principles to the broad masses of workers, engineering and technical personnel, and businessmen and assist the government in doing this work. (Applause)

The above-mentioned situation of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce shows that China, in the process of socialist revolution, that is, the process of socialist transformation, has taken a big step forward. It can be said that in the struggle between socialism and capitalism, the outcome has been decided. (Prolonged and lively applause) This is just as Chairman Mao Zedong said: "The fundamental change in the current political situation of our country has already occurred." (Prolonged and lively applause)

Marxism-Leninism has long pointed out that under the leadership of the proletarian dictatorship, it is possible for the capitalist system to peacefully transition to the socialist system under certain conditions. The practice of the Chinese people has brilliantly verified this possibility. (Applause) The increasingly consolidated state power led by the working class, the increasingly developed socialist economy, the increasingly powerful united front of the Chinese people based on the worker-peasant alliance and including the national bourgeoisie, the existence of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and its great assistance to China, and other favorable international conditions, all these are the conditions and guarantees for China to peacefully transition to a socialist society.

When talking about the reasons for the particularly rapid development of China's socialist transformation in recent times, in addition to pointing out that this is the comprehensive result of various works carried out by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the government in the past six years, it is also necessary to point out that this is inseparable from the struggle against rightist conservative thought in various aspects of work by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in recent times. The socialist consciousness of the broad masses of the people has become increasingly mature, but rightist conservatives do not see this enthusiasm and suppress this enthusiasm. After removing this obstacle, the socialist transformation movement has rapidly developed like a tide, surging forward and exceeding all previous expectations. Therefore, Chairman Mao Zedong said: "In about three more years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed nationwide." (Long and lively applause)

The scale and speed of the socialist transformation have far exceeded the indicators set by the first Five-Year Plan, which provides favorable conditions for the accelerated development of China's socialist industrialization and the new upsurge of the national economy.

We have successfully completed the third-year plan of the first Five-Year Plan. According to the current statistical data, the total industrial output value in 1955 exceeded the plan and increased by 62% compared to 1952. The agricultural production in 1955 achieved an unprecedented harvest, with a grain output of 365 billion jin, an increase of 37.2 billion jin compared to the bumper harvest year of 1952; the cotton output reached 30.06 million piculs, an increase of 3.96 million piculs compared to the bumper harvest year of 1952; the two main crops of grain and cotton in 1955 both exceeded the highest historical output by a large margin. The basic construction in 1955 also achieved many achievements, especially in the aspect of savings. The other economic undertakings and scientific, cultural, educational, and health undertakings in 1955 also developed accordingly.

1956 will be a year of particularly active and overall upsurge in China's national economy. According to the preliminary draft of the 1956 plan, compared to 1955, the total industrial output value will increase by 18.6%; the grain output in agriculture will increase by approximately 9%, and the cotton output will increase by approximately 18%; the basic construction investment will increase by approximately 60%; other economic undertakings and scientific, cultural, educational, and health undertakings will also develop at a faster pace. As long as there is no major natural disaster and we strive to complete the 1956 plan, China will be able to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule by half a year to a year in the main indicators. (Lively applause)

Now, the problem facing the people of the whole country is to make various construction undertakings more, faster, better, and more economical, so that the development of various undertakings can adapt to the changed situation and meet the needs of the state and the people. We should strive to do those things that can be done objectively through effort; not to do so would be to commit the error of rightist conservatism; we should also avoid going beyond the range allowed by objective conditions and forcibly doing those things that cannot be done objectively, otherwise, it would be to commit the error of reckless adventurism.

Of course, completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilling it is not something that can be achieved by slogans, calls, and resolutions alone; this requires a series of specific measures to be taken in the work of various departments, the improvement of the leadership of various departments, and a large amount of practical work to be done among the masses to discover and promote advanced experiences, making the backward become advanced and the advanced become more advanced. I do not intend to say much about this issue here. I only want to point out here that although many enterprises have found and implemented ways to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, and many enterprises have already run ahead of the original timetable, there are still many enterprises with very backward production conditions. The leaders of these enterprises, in the tide of opposing conservatism, have also modified some quotas, and these new quotas seem to be advanced to them, but as long as they seriously organize the masses to discuss and compare them with truly advanced quotas, they will know that they are still very conservative and have not truly striven to tap their own production potential. They have not fully completed the plan indicators, and often use the form of completing the indicators of product quantity and output value to cover up the essence of not completing the indicators of product quality, variety, and cost. Some backward enterprise leaders, seeing that other enterprises have run ahead, do not learn from these advanced enterprises but instead busy themselves finding excuses for their backwardness, even thinking: since many other enterprises have already completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it, then even if a few enterprises are backward, the total indicators of the Five-Year Plan will still be exceeded! The responsibility of the leaders of various departments is to launch a criticism against such people who are content with backwardness, not to adopt a conciliatory attitude, not to let them take advantage of advanced producers, but to use the example of advanced producers to urge backward producers to get out of their backward state. Only in this way can the leaders prove that they are not rightist conservatives, not protectors of rightist conservatism, and correctly fulfill the leadership responsibilities given by the government. Only in this way can we truly and comprehensively complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it.

Completing the socialist transformation ahead of schedule and completing and overfulfilling the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule will enable us to overfulfill China's industrial development plan during the transitional period and accelerate the technological transformation of the national economy. Recently, the State Planning Commission, in conjunction with various departments and provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, has been drafting the outline of the second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy based on the draft of the fifteen-year long-term plan, so as to be able to guide the accelerated development of various economic and cultural undertakings.

To complete the above tasks, we must rely not only on the creative labor of the working class and the broad masses of peasants but also fully mobilize and give play to the strength of China's intellectuals. This conference is planned to focus on discussing the issue of intellectuals, so I will say a few more words about this issue here.

What is the current issue of intellectuals? This is that the current strength of China's intellectuals, whether in terms of quantity, professional level, or political awareness, is still unable to meet the needs of the rapid development of the socialist cause; and some government departments have certain irrational phenomena in the use and treatment of intellectuals, which to different degrees hinder the full play of the strength of intellectuals. This requires us to strengthen leadership, overcome shortcomings, and take a series of effective measures to fully mobilize and give play to the current strength of intellectuals, continuously improve their political awareness and professional level, and on a large scale cultivate new forces to expand their ranks to meet the country's constantly growing demand for intellectuals.

In the past six years, the face of China's intellectual community has undergone fundamental changes. The vast majority of existing intellectuals have become state cadres, have served socialism, and have become part of the working class. They generally participate in political study, social reform struggles, and ideological remolding movements. The ranks of intellectuals have also expanded rapidly in the past six years, with a considerable number of intellectuals from the working class supplementing their ranks. Due to the efforts of the broad masses of intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, in the past six years, China's scientific, cultural, educational, and health undertakings have made great developments, and the professional level of China's intellectuals has also been significantly improved. However, from an overall perspective, China's scientific and technological situation is still far behind the world's advanced level. We must mobilize the strength of intellectuals to catch up with the world's advanced scientific and cultural level in a relatively short period. This is a great and glorious fighting task for China's people, first and foremost, intellectuals. (Prolonged and lively applause)

Generally speaking, the strength of China's intellectuals has been mobilized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the government. In this regard, various democratic parties and people's organizations have also done a lot of work. However, it cannot be denied that some state organs and state cadres, due to underestimating the progress of intellectuals and underestimating their role in the socialist cause, still have some shortcomings in dealing with intellectuals. The main problems here are: first, we should improve the use and arrangement of intellectuals so that they can give full play to their expertise beneficial to the state; second, we should give intellectuals the trust and support they deserve so that they can work actively and boldly; third, we should provide intellectuals with the necessary working conditions and appropriate treatment so that they can concentrate their main energy on their work.

Modern science and technology are advancing by leaps and bounds, and the discovery and utilization of atomic energy and the further development and application of electronics have brought mankind to the eve of a new industrial revolution. China's people, first and foremost, intellectuals, have reached the time to advance towards modern science! We must formulate a comprehensive plan for scientific development, strengthen and expand scientific research institutions, cultivate a large number of scientific research talents, and prepare all necessary conditions for the development of scientific undertakings. The State Planning Commission is currently working with the Academy of Sciences and various departments to draft a long-term plan for the development of China's science from 1956 to 1967. The starting point of this long-term plan is to introduce the world's most advanced scientific achievements to China as quickly as possible according to needs and possibilities, to supplement the most urgent and needed categories in China's scientific undertakings as quickly as possible, and to arrange and plan China's scientific research work based on the achievements of world science, striving to make China's most urgent scientific departments approach the world's advanced level by the end of the third Five-Year Plan. (Lively applause)

Helping intellectuals carry out self-reform is of great significance in fully mobilizing and giving play to the strength of intellectuals. The majority of China's intellectuals have already or are in the process of standing on the side of socialism, but many of them still inevitably have different degrees of bourgeois ideas and styles in their thoughts and actions. In the ranks of the intellectual community, there are still a small number of people who do not understand socialism and even oppose it in their thoughts. In addition, there are a few percent of counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements. We must thoroughly purge the active counter-revolutionaries hidden in the intellectual community and reduce the number of backward elements to the minimum, make the intermediate elements become advanced elements as much as possible, and make the advanced elements become completely socialist intellectuals. We hope that China's intellectuals, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, will adopt the method of self-education, through the three interconnected paths of observing and practicing social life, practicing business, and studying Marxism-Leninism theory, gradually grow into intellectuals who wholeheartedly serve socialism. (Applause)

We believe that China's intellectuals will further unite around the Chinese Communist Party and strive to improve China's scientific and cultural level. (Applause) The alliance of China's workers, peasants, and intellectuals in the socialist cause will be stronger day by day. (Applause) Relying on the strength of this alliance, we will definitely overfulfill China's industrial development plan and accelerate the technological transformation of the national economy. (Lively applause)

China's socialist transformation and socialist construction are developing at a faster pace and on a larger scale, and our country will be able to appear in the world as a completely modernized, highly cultured, prosperous, and powerful socialist industrial power in a not very long time. (The entire venue erupted in thunderous applause) What China's people are proud of is that, as Chairman Mao Zedong said, "We are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done." (The entire venue erupted in prolonged and lively applause)

However, China's people have no right to forget that imperialism is still standing in front of us, and there are counter-revolutionaries carrying out sabotage activities, and Taiwan has not been liberated. This requires us to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, further consolidate the alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and further consolidate the united front of the people led by the Chinese Communist Party, so as to use the united strength of the people of the whole country to fight for the defense of the motherland and the defense of the socialist cause. We must unite as one, continue to fight against the imperialist policy of aggression and war, and strive for a lasting international peaceful environment for China's socialist cause. We must unite as one, continue to fight against the hidden counter-revolutionaries in the organs and society, and defend China's socialist cause from being harmed by counter-revolutionary activities. We must unite as one, continue to fight for the liberation of Taiwan, so that Taiwan can return to the motherland and achieve the complete unification of China. (Long and lively applause)

Here, I want to talk about the issue of liberating Taiwan.

When our great motherland is striding towards socialism, 8 million compatriots in Taiwan are still under the rule of foreign military forces and cannot advance with the people of the motherland. Therefore, it is self-evident that the people of the motherland cannot but be very concerned about the fate of the compatriots in Taiwan, and the compatriots in Taiwan, seeing the motherland becoming more and more prosperous, must also feel inspired and look forward to returning to the motherland's embrace as soon as possible. (Applause)

Why has Taiwan not been liberated to this day? As mentioned earlier, the main reason is that the United States uses military force to occupy Taiwan, interferes in China's internal affairs, and turns Taiwan into its military base. This has created a long-term tense situation in the Taiwan region and hindered the liberation of Taiwan.

However, no matter what, Taiwan is sacred Chinese territory, and the compatriots in Taiwan are an inseparable part of the Chinese people. The liberation of Taiwan, no matter what form it takes, is an internal affair of China. This is something that no one can deny. All Chinese people, including the people on the mainland and the people in Taiwan, should unite under the banner of patriotism and work together to solve this internal affair of ours. We will not allow any third party to interfere in this internal affair of ours, and no third party has the right to interfere in this internal affair of ours. (Lively applause) Everyone knows that when the mainland was liberated, Beijing, Suiyuan, Hunan, Xinjiang, Tibet, and other places were liberated peacefully, and the military that surrendered peacefully has become part of the Liberation Army, and the officers who surrendered peacefully have been holding important positions in the state for a long time. The Chinese government has repeatedly pointed out in the past year: in addition to liberating Taiwan by war, there is also the possibility of liberating Taiwan peacefully. In this way, the people of the mainland and the people of Taiwan have a common patriotic responsibility, which is to actively prepare for the liberation of Taiwan by war if necessary, and strive for the liberation of Taiwan peacefully.

The compatriots in Taiwan are suffering extremely heavy disasters today. They have just been liberated from the old colonial rule, but soon they were thrown into the abyss of American military rule. The United States has controlled the military, politics, and economy of Taiwan, plundering the rich resources of Taiwan, squeezing the blood of the compatriots in Taiwan, and driving the compatriots in Taiwan to be cannon fodder for the United States. Under this dark and oppressive foreign military rule, Taiwan is now in a state of industrial and commercial decline, rural bankruptcy, and the compatriots in Taiwan are living in a life of poverty, hunger, and terror. We believe that the compatriots in Taiwan, who have a revolutionary tradition of fighting for freedom and liberation, will never be willing to live in a life of slavery under foreign rule. (Lively applause)

At the same time, we also believe that all the military and political personnel of the Kuomintang who fled to Taiwan will not be able to maintain their current situation for long. History has proven that invaders will inevitably fail, and those who rely on invaders to prolong their lives will either follow the failure or be sacrificed. Now, the military and political personnel of the Kuomintang, from top to bottom, are all anxious and depressed, pessimistic and hopeless, internally divided, and their rule is increasingly shaky, which is the proof that their current situation cannot last long. Under this trend, the military and political personnel of the Kuomintang have only two paths to choose from: one is to continue to follow the United States, putting the compatriots in Taiwan in a miserable situation of foreign rule, and at the same time, leading themselves to a dead end; the other is to have a sudden awakening, arouse their patriotic conscience, and liberate Taiwan peacefully, so that the compatriots in Taiwan can return to the motherland's embrace, and they themselves can have the opportunity to be forgiven by the people of the motherland.

In any case, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and Taiwan will definitely return to the motherland. (The entire venue erupted in thunderous applause) If the military and political personnel of the Kuomintang see this big trend, are willing to liberate Taiwan peacefully, and help the motherland eliminate the tense situation in the Taiwan region and achieve the complete unification of the great motherland, then they will not only have made a contribution to the motherland but also made a contribution to the peace of Asia and the world.

The Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party have always advocated national unity and unity against external enemies. In Chinese history, the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang have had two cooperative relationships. In these two cooperative relationships, the Communist Party and the Kuomintang have fought side by side and jointly resisted imperialism. Even in the Third Civil War of Revolution, the Chinese Communist Party, while fighting the liberation war, has never given up the effort of peaceful negotiations. Now, the Kuomintang military and political personnel who fled to Taiwan and overseas, there must be quite a few who want to return to the mainland to visit relatives and friends. We call on all the Kuomintang military and political personnel who fled to Taiwan and overseas to stop hesitating and take the road of peaceful liberation of Taiwan as soon as possible! Therefore, I, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, announce here: those who want to return to the mainland to visit relatives and friends can come to the mainland. Those who want to come to the mainland to visit and study can also come to the mainland. Those who want to take the road of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, no matter who they are, and no matter how big their crimes were in the past, the Chinese people will treat them generously and not pursue past offenses. Those who have made contributions in the action of peaceful liberation of Taiwan will be rewarded according to the size of their contributions. Those who return to the motherland through peaceful means will be properly arranged in their work. (Applause)

Compatriots in Taiwan and all those who fled to Taiwan and overseas, stand under the banner of patriotism, and fight together with the people of the motherland for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the complete unification of the motherland! (Long and lively applause)

Comrades! Friends!

I will conclude my report.

The people of China are striding forward on the socialist road. Under the banner of socialism, the people of China have begun to march towards science! Towards the elimination of the roots of class and exploitation, backwardness, and poverty! (Lively applause) We are achieving great victories in the socialist revolution and will definitely achieve complete and thorough victories in this revolution. (Lively applause) All nationalities, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and all patriotic people in China must unite more closely, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, carry out tense work and creative labor, beware of any boasting and arrogance, strive for the continued easing of international tensions and the consolidation of world peace, strive for the completion of the state's overall tasks in the transitional period and the improvement of China's scientific and cultural level, and strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the complete unification of the motherland. (The entire venue erupted in thunderous and prolonged applause)

    政治报告
    （1956年1月30日，在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议上）
    周恩来同志们、朋友们：
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议现在开幕了。这次会议原来准备在1955年第四季举行，但是由于当时全国社会主义改造事业发展很快，大家都忙于工作，不容易抽出时间，因而推迟到现在。这也给我们一种便利，使我们现在可以比较容易地总结社会主义改造的经验了。
    这次会议除原有545位委员外，有119位新委员，同时还有626位各界人士列席，共计1，290人。这个事实表明，随着社会主义事业的前进，我国的人民民主统一战线比以前更加广泛、更加强大了。全国各方面的人士，看到我们伟大祖国的兴盛，表现了空前未有的爱国热忱，表现了空前未有的政治积极性和团结一致。这是值得庆贺的气象。依靠全国各族人民和各界人士的团结奋斗，我们祖国的各项事业一定会进行得更加顺利，更加迅速。（热烈掌声）
    我们的会议有六个报告。我的政治报告将首先说到目前的国际形势，关于国内问题，我将侧重于最为大家所关心的几个方面。
    就国际方面说，过去的一年是国际紧张局势趋向和缓的一年。
    在第二次世界大战结束以后的年代里，国际和平力量和国际战争力量进行了尖锐的、反复的斗争，国际和平力量日益取得主动，保卫世界和平的队伍已经发展和壮大起来。在这个队伍里，有以苏联为首的社会主义国家，也广泛地包括了世界上其他爱好和平的人民和国家。去年以来，主张和平共处、反对殖民主义的“万隆精神”，主张和缓国际紧张局势和用协商方式解决国际争端的“日内瓦精神”，已经在全世界人民当中得到越来越多的支持。而美国侵略集团和它的追随者继续坚持的所谓“实力”政策，实际上是以战争进行恐吓和讹诈的政策，已经不断地遭受失败，使他们自己日益陷入被动。从总的方面说来，目前的国际形势是有利于世界和平，有利于我们的社会主义建设，不利于侵略集团的战争计划和侵略政策的。
    第二次世界大战以后，形成了以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营。十年来，我们社会主义阵营各国在各方面建设中的突飞猛进，使我们的力量得到不断的壮大和巩固。拥有九亿人口、在欧亚两洲大陆上连成一片的社会主义阵营各国，处于在任何情况下都可以互相支援的优越形势，并且在互相之间建立了真诚合作和兄弟般的友好关系。同社会主义阵营的这种欣欣向荣的迅速发展和内部团结日益巩固的情况相反，以美国侵略集团为首的帝国主义阵营，却经常为危机所苦，内部矛盾越来越尖锐。社会主义阵营各国在建设中所获得的辉煌成就和一贯坚持的和平共处政策，赢得了世界各国爱好和平人民的广泛欢迎和支持。我们社会主义国家同一切愿意保持和平的国家之间的友好关系，也日益发展。而帝国主义侵略集团所执行的侵略政策和准备战争的政策，却遭到了爱好和平的各国人民日益坚决的反抗，使他们在世界上处于日益孤立的地位。
    但是，美国侵略集团和它的追随者却不肯承认世界上已经发生的这一切变化。他们为了追求垄断资本的最大限度利润和夺取世界霸权，还是坚持他们的侵略政策和战争政策。为了掩盖他们这种政策的实质，美国侵略集团和它的追随者不断重复地捏造着一系列所谓共产主义威胁的谎言，进行恐吓和欺骗。
    不管美国侵略集团怎样造谣，各国人民都知道，过去发动战争、现在还在准备新战争的，不是社会主义国家，而是帝国主义国家。社会主义国家一贯奉行的是和平政策，并且不断为巩固和平、和缓国际紧张局势和发展各国之间的友好合作而努力。谁都知道，我们社会主义国家坚决主张普遍裁减军备和完全禁止原子武器和氢武器。在这一问题上，为了达成国际间的协议，苏联作了真诚的努力，并且同所有人民民主国家一起采取了实际行动；但是美国侵略集团和它的追随者不仅没有作出相应的努力，反而从他们原来的裁军立场上后退，以阻挠对裁军问题达成协议。社会主义国家坚决反对侵略性的军事集团，主张用不排斥任何国家的集体安全和集体和平的体系，来保证世界各国的安全和和平。但是，美国侵略集团和它的追随者却狂热地组织北大西洋公约、西欧联盟、马尼拉条约、巴格达条约等排他的侵略性的军事集团，在别国的领土上广泛地建立和扩充军事基地。社会主义国家一贯主张用和平方法解决国际争端，但是美国侵略集团却推行着“战争边缘”的恐吓和讹诈政策。事实胜于雄辩，任何公正的人都能看到究竟是谁要战争，谁要和平。　
    美国侵略集团对于很多国家明目张胆地进行颠复活动，威胁着很多国家的安全。这个事实，原来许多不了解的人现在也了解了。美国侵略集团从来没有停止对于社会主义国家进行颠复性的破坏活动。它至今还在叫嚣着充满血腥气的所谓“解放”政策，妄想把人民民主国家的人民早已推翻了的腐败的社会制度，和反动透顶的统治人物，重新强加在他们身上。美国侵略集团至今不仅不承认中国人民所早已作出的选择，而且还公开干涉中国内政，使用武力和武力威胁来侵犯中国的领土主权，妄图阻挠中国人民完成全国统一的事业。对于亚洲、非洲、中南美洲和世界其他地区的一切要求维护主权和独立的国家，包括美国的同盟国家在内，美国侵略集团也从来不惜用制造分裂和武装政变的手段来进行颠复和破坏活动。事实如此，美国侵略集团却不惜颠倒是非诬蔑社会主义国家进行颠复活动。这种谎言是改变不了事实的。我们相信社会主义制度的优越性。但是，我们一贯认为革命不能输出。我们主张不同的社会制度的国家和平共处和和平竞赛，由各国人民自己选择他们自己的政治、经济制度和生活方式。我们坚决反对使用武力或任何其他方法来干涉别国的内政，阻挠别国人民作出自己的选择。中国同印度和缅甸一起倡议并受到苏联、南斯拉夫等许多国家支持的互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，就是我们这种主张的一个体现。
    全世界都看到，美国侵略集团不但竭力支持正在崩溃的殖民制度，而且它自己就是目前全世界最大的殖民主义者。它竭力通过建立全世界的军事基地网、建立军事集团和所谓援助落后地区等办法，扩大它自己的殖民统治，建立世界霸权。美国公开地把印度的果阿和中国的澳门说成是葡萄牙的“省”。美国在联合国中一贯反对殖民地人民有民族自决权利。美国侵略集团已经成为全世界殖民统治的主要支柱。可是美国侵略集团和它的追随者居然胡说什么社会主义“是殖民主义的一种形式”。社会主义制度是没有人剥削人的制度，这种制度同一个国家奴役和掠夺另一个国家的制度是根本不相同的。社会主义国家一贯支持一切被压迫民族的斗争，坚决反对任何形式的殖民主义。30多年来，苏联始终是世界各地被压迫民族的最忠实的和最坚强的支持者。最近苏联国家领导人员访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的时候，最生动地表达了苏联对一切争取和保障民族独立的人民和国家的无限同情和支持。我们社会主义国家认为，世界上一切民族和一切国家不分大小都应该是平等的，没有优劣之分；各国人民都应该有自决的权利，而不受任何其他国家的奴役和掠夺。我们中国和其他一些社会主义国家都曾经在历史上处于殖民地和半殖民地的地位，并且就是在反对殖民主义的斗争中取得独立的。摆脱了殖民统治的，不只有社会主义国家，还有由民族主义者领导的国家。今后还必然会有更多的被压迫的民族和国家，根据他们自己所选择的道路，摆脱殖民主义的统治。这是历史发展的必然趋势，这是任何力量阻挡不了的。
    美国侵略集团一贯地通过所谓援助落后国家来进行奴役和剥削。它借“援助”之名倾销剩余物资，从而夺取其他国家的市场，破坏其他国家的经济。它使落后国家永远处于原料供应地和工业品销售市场的地位，以便对他们进行奴役和剥削。它通过所谓“援助”，要求受“援”国家割让军事基地，在军事上、政治上和经济上承担对他们不利的义务，要求对“援助”的使用进行监督以便控制受“援”国家。所有这些，都不是什么秘密。同美国侵略集团完全相反，社会主义国家在互相支援或者同其他国家进行经济合作的时候所执行的政策，首先是互通有无。我们不强迫别的国家接受它们所不需要的或者它们自己有足够生产的货品。我们的政策的另一个特点是帮助经济上不发达的国家发展本国的工业和取得经济上的独立。我们并且不向受援助的国家要求任何特权。不论我们所提供的是经济上的或者是技术上的帮助，我们所根据的原则始终是平等互利和互不干涉内政。
    事实已经很清楚，美国侵略集团打着反对共产主义的旗帜，制造一系列的谎言，完全是为了掩盖它自己准备战争和进行侵略。毫无疑问，美国侵略集团是想把它的战争矛头指向社会主义国家的。但是，由于社会主义国家的强大，美国侵略集团用尽了一切手段，包括武装干涉和颠复活动在内，经过多次的较量，都没有得到任何好处，反而遭到了严重的打击。因此，美国侵略集团实际上是在反对共产主义的借口下，首先在它的势力能够打进的地区进行扩张，侵犯这些地区各国的国家主权和民族利益，并且利用各种方式进行殖民主义的奴役和掠夺。这就不能不引起这些地区的人民起来为反抗这种战争政策和侵略政策而斗争。而社会主义阵营的强大和这个阵营的和平政策的影响，加上许多民族独立国家坚持和平中立政策所起的作用，更有力地鼓舞着他们的斗争。这种斗争的发展使得美国侵略集团日益陷于窘境。
    在亚洲、非洲和中南美洲蓬勃发展的民族解放运动，动摇了殖民主义在这些地区的统治，有力地阻止着美国侵略集团的政策在这些地区的实施。在东南亚，印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、阿富汗等国家，已经摆脱了殖民地的地位，走上了独立发展的道路。这些国家珍视他们已经取得的民族独立，并且决心保卫他们的独立和主权。他们谴责敌对性的军事集团，反对战争威胁，他们坚持中立地位，要求各国和平共处。这些国家，特别是作为世界大国的印度，在和平解决许多国际重大问题方面起着越来越大的积极作用。我们深切地尊重这些国家的立场，我们同他们已经根据和平共处的原则建立了友好关系，我们同这些国家在争取和平和国际安全的斗争中正进行着多方面的合作。在非洲和中近东，以埃及为首的阿拉伯国家，坚决维护他们的民族独立，奋勇地抗拒着帝国主义侵略集团破坏阿拉伯国家的主权和分裂阿拉伯国家的活动。最近，约旦人民反抗巴格达条约的斗争赢得了世界广大人民的同情和支持。我们高兴地看到，苏丹宣布独立，并且参加阿拉伯国家的行列，进行共同的斗争。我们也愿意看到，北非各国人民争取民族自决的愿望能够得到实现。在亚非会议期间，我们同非洲和中近东的一些国家建立了友好的接触。现在，我们同他们的关系又有了进一步的发展。我们同情和支持亚洲、非洲和中南美洲一切为争取和保障民族独立而斗争的人民和国家。他们的斗争是正义的，世界上没有任何力量能够阻止他们胜利。他们的胜利将是对和平力量的加强和对战争势力的打击。
    在这些地区也还有一些国家，他们幻想从加入侵略性的军事集团或者追随美国的侵略政策得到好处。但是，事实说明，参加侵略性的军事集团，帮助帝国主义在这些地区制造分裂，最后只能使自己成为帝国主义分而治之的牺牲品。把自己的民族利益套在美国侵略集团的战车上，追随美国的侵略政策，不可能保障自己的民族独立，而只能使自己在政治上和经济上更加处于从属的地位，不可能使自己富强起来，而只能使自己更加贫弱。这些国家的人民和有远见的政治家，日益强烈地要求走上另一条道路，那就是摆脱目前被束缚的困境，同这些地区的其他国家一起，为争取和平、保障民族独立和发展各国间的友好合作而共同努力。我们具有同这些国家友好的愿望。我们高兴地看到，中泰两国人民之间一度中断的联系，最近已开始恢复。我们愿意根据万隆精神同所有这些国家的领导人和人民接触，以消除任何可能存在的隔膜。
    重新武装西德和日本是美国侵略集团备战计划中的一个重要组成部分。但是，不久以前曾经被本国的军国主义分子拖入战争灾难的德意志人民和日本人民，也越来越坚决地反对重新武装起来替美国侵略集团打仗。德意志人民已经看到，美国侵略集团重新武装西德的政策，不但威胁德意志人民和欧洲各国人民的和平和安全，而且还阻挠德意志的统一，使西德长期处于从属的地位。在德意志民主共和国，德意志人民已经用国家的形式把他们的民主和爱好和平的力量组织起来，为实现德意志的和平民主统一而奋斗。在西德，反对重新武装、要求和平统一的力量也在增长。我们一贯认为，德意志统一的问题应该在符合德意志人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益的情况下，由德意志人民自己解决。中国已经同德意志民主共和国结成了牢不可破的友谊。为了和平和重新统一德国成为一个爱好和平的民主国家，中国也欢迎同德意志联邦共和国的关系正常化。
    战争结束已经十年，日本仍然处于被美国占领的地位，受着各种奴役性的不平等条约和协定的束缚。在日本境内布满着美国的军事基地和军事设施。美国的禁运政策妨碍了日本同其他国家的正常贸易，使日本的经济处于更加困难的境地。一直是独立的日本民族现在在各方面受到美国的干涉和控制。这种情况已经使日本人民越来越不能容忍。最近以来，日本国内要求摆脱外国控制的运动有了巨大的增长。日本人民和有远见的政治家日益主张执行独立自主的政策，反对对美国侵略集团的追随和屈从。他们反对外国军事基地，要求禁止原子武器和氢武器。他们主张扩大同世界各国的联系，首先是中日、苏日关系的正常化。中国人民深切同情日本的困难处境，完全支持日本人民的独立愿望。我们同日本人民开展了政治、经济和文化方面的联系。我们根据和平共处的原则，一直在努力促进中日关系的正常化。中国政府曾经在去年8月17日和11月4日两次向日本政府建议，由两国政府对促进中日关系正常化的问题进行商谈。我们感到遗憾的是，至今还没有得到日本政府的答复。促进中日关系的正常化是两国人民的迫切要求，中国政府再次建议两国政府对这个问题进行商谈。我们希望日本能够执行独立自主的外交政策，我们欢迎日本回到亚洲国家的大家庭来，同亚洲和世界各国和平相处，友好合作。
    美国侵略集团的备战和扩张政策，严重地损害着它的西方同盟国家的利益。这些国家由于参加了美国控制的军事集团，而不能不担负他们力不胜任的军事费用，造成了经济上越来越大的困难。同时美国的禁运政策严重地阻碍着他们正常的国际贸易。这样就加深了他们对美国的依赖。如果他们原来指望借助同美国的同盟，来保存他们在殖民地和势力范围方面的既得利益的话，那么，他们也应该早已发现，美国侵略集团正是利用这种同盟，来夺取他们的既得利益。美国的同盟国家的广大人民，已经越来越不能容忍他们的国家追随美国侵略集团的政策，他们已经在用行动表示出他们的反抗。最近法国大选的结果，就是一个生动的证明。在这些国家的统治阶级中，也已经有越来越多的人，要求执行独立自主的政策。很显然，许多资本主义国家要求摆脱美国控制的趋势，还将继续发展下去。这种趋势符合有关各国人民的利益，同时也有利于世界的和平。芬兰、瑞典、瑞士的中立地位，替它们的人民带来的好处，越来越吸引着其他资本主义国家。奥地利决定保持永久中立，为奥地利的和平发展开辟了道路。我们尊重奥地利的中立地位，并且愿意看到中国和奥地利的和平合作关系能够建立起来。
    美国侵略集团的扩军备战政策，在美国国内也引起了日益增长的不满和反对。广大的人民群众担心“实力”政策带来的战争威胁。他们的生活条件不断恶化，他们的民主自由权利受到剥夺。为了改善生活条件、保卫民主自由、争取和平和反对战争，美国人民展开了广泛的斗争。这种情况不能不对美国统治集团产生影响。在美国统治集团内部，也有一些比较有远见的人逐渐认识到，使用战争和战争威胁，鼓吹走向“战争边缘”，继续执行依靠“实力”的僵硬政策，只能使美国更加孤立。因此，他们要求在承认现实的基础上采取比较清醒的政策。在美国工商业界中，也有不少人不满意美国的禁运政策，而要求发展正常的国际贸易。这些都是值得欢迎的。中国人民所坚决反对的是美国侵略集团所执行的扩军备战政策，和阻挠我国完全统一、敌视中国人民的侵略政策，但是，我们从来不敌视美国人民，同时，也不抹杀美国政府任何有利于和缓国际紧张局势的行动。我们愿意同美国人民友好相处。我们也愿意改善同美国的关系。
    在世界广大人民和各方面的强大压力下，美国政府有时也不能不采取一些在客观上有利于和缓国际紧张局势的行动。但是，美国侵略集团不甘心看到紧张局势真正有所和缓。它害怕国际局势的和缓，会降低扩军备战给垄断资本带来的利润，它害怕国际局势的和缓，会使它失去对其他国家的控制。因此，在每一次国际紧张局势有了一些和缓之后，它就加紧制造紧张，阻挠局势的进一步和缓。这就形成了世界人民要求和缓、美国侵略集团制造紧张的反复斗争。由于世界人民已经越来越看透了这种不断制造紧张来进行恐吓和讹诈的阴谋，美国侵略集团就在每一次制造紧张之后，遭到新的失败，处于更大的被动。
    美国侵略集团害怕和缓、制造紧张的事实，清楚地表现在美国国务卿杜勒斯最近发表的言论中。全世界人民都要求国际紧张局势的进一步和缓，但是美国国务卿却公开炫耀“战争边缘”的政策，而且还吹嘘这种恐吓政策如何在朝鲜、印度支那和台湾地区发生过效力。有健全记忆的人都知道，朝鲜停战的实现，恰恰是中朝人民在军事上给予侵略者以沉重的打击、和全世界爱好和平的人民在道义上给予侵略者以强大压力的结果。朝鲜停战以后，美国侵略集团又企图用扩大印度支那战争的办法，来重新制造紧张局势。但是，越南民主共和国解放奠边府的巨大胜利，粉碎了美国侵略集团的战争讹诈，美国战争政策并没有能够阻止印度支那和平的恢复，却使美国陷入完全的孤立。印度支那的战火被扑灭以后，美国侵略集团又通过所谓国会决议、所谓“美蒋共同防御条约”，公开以武力威胁，来干涉中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿，来维持和加剧由于美国侵占台湾而造成的紧张局势。但是，结果不是中国人民被吓倒，而是中国人民解放了一江山岛，迫使蒋介石集团撤出大陈和南麂。这就完全戳穿了美国侵略集团的战争讹诈。美国侵略集团不甘心这一系列的失败，还在继续阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，破坏日内瓦协议在印度支那的实施，加紧在台湾地区的军事活动，竭力企图保持远东的紧张局势，继续执行所谓“战争边缘”的政策。但是，全世界人民包括美国人民在内，对于美国国务卿的这种恐吓叫嚣的一致谴责，雄辩地证实了美国侵略集团的战争讹诈政策的破产。
    我们认为，战争讹诈政策解决不了任何问题，亚洲和世界各项悬而未决的问题仍然应该通过协商求得解决，有关各国应该继续采取措施促进国际紧张局势进一步的和缓。
    中国已经提出，现在仍然主张召开有亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议，来协商解决朝鲜的和平统一问题。
    日内瓦协议关于就越南全国选举进行协商的规定遭到无理的破坏，越南国际委员会的工作受到横暴的阻挠。坐视这种情况继续下去，将带来极其严重的后果。中国建议重新召开有关印度支那问题的日内瓦会议，保证日内瓦协议在越南的实施，并且认为，这一会议应该邀请越南国际委员会的三个国家——印度、波兰、加拿大参加。
    关于和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势问题，我愿意谈一谈自从1955年8月1日起在日内瓦举行的中美两国大使级会谈。
    中美两国大使级会谈的第一项议程是双方平民回国问题。中国对于这个问题从一开始就采取解决问题的态度，并且在协议达成以后忠实地履行协议。但是，美国政府即使是在协议达成以后也没有放弃它阻挠中国侨民回国的种种威胁和迫害的手段。美国政府迫使他们申请作为“政治难民”，申请在美国“永久居留”，甚至规定他们必须取得“台湾入境证”，企图完全剥夺他们回国的权利。
    美国这种严重违反协议的情况是不能容许的。所有在美国的中国人，即使被迫申请作为“政治难民”，被迫申请在美国“永远居留”，或者被迫领取“台湾入境证”，他们的回国权利也丝毫不应该受到损害。如果他们回国遭到任何阻难，他们完全有权要求中国政府或者印度驻美大使馆协助。美国政府如果继续对他们进行威胁和迫害，就必须承担破坏协议的全部责任。
    中美两国大使级会谈的第二项议程是双方有所争执的其他实际问题。中国在这一项议程下提出了禁运问题和准备更高一级的中美谈判问题。美国拒绝对这两个议题进行实质性的讨论，却要求发表中美双方放弃使用武力的声明。中国并不反对发表这一声明，事实上，中国一贯主张用协商方法解决中美两国之间的争端而不诉诸武力。但是，由于美国已经使用武力侵占了中国的台湾，中美双方关于放弃使用武力的声明，就必须导致美国已经使用了的武力的解除，而不容许造成美国侵占台湾的合法化。
    中国政府认为，要实现中美两国不使用武力的原则，必须举行中美外长会议，来解决和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势的问题。
    可是美国在会谈中所表示的态度说明，它提出放弃使用武力问题的目的，并不是为了导致台湾地区紧张局势的和缓和消除，而是要继续和加剧台湾地区的紧张局势。美国在它提出的中美双方声明草案中，竟提到美国要在中国的领土台湾行使所谓单独或集体的自卫权利。台湾是中国的领土，只有中国才能在台湾行使自卫的权利。美国的目的显然是要在所谓“自卫权利”的借口下，继续保持在台湾地区已经对中国使用了的武力，同时还企图使中国承认美国侵占台湾的合法化，以便继续利用蒋介石集团，造成所谓“两个中国”的形势。美国这种目的是中国在任何情况下都不能同意的。中国的立场非常明确，中国愿意继续争取会谈达成协议，但是中国不能同意会谈长此拖延，使台湾地区的紧张局势不能获得解决。
    为了实现亚洲和太平洋地区的集体和平，中国政府愿意重申它在1955年7月30日提出的主张，亚洲和太平洋地区的国家，包括美国在内，应该签订一个集体和平公约，来代替目前存在于这个地区的对立性的军事集团。中国愿意同一切有关国家为实现这一主张而共同努力。
    在这里应该特别提到，苏联政府最近向美国政府建议签订苏美友好合作条约，这是苏联继日内瓦四国政府首脑会议以后，为和缓国际紧张局势而作的又一巨大努力。中国完全支持苏联的这一建议。令人遗憾的是，美国当局很快地就拒绝了苏联的建议。苏联和美国之间关系的改善密切地关系着世界的和平。苏联为此而提出的新建议，完全符合世界广大人民的迫切要求，决不是轻率的拒绝所能推开的。
    同志们、朋友们！目前国际局势走向和缓的总趋势，是美国侵略集团阻挡不住的。但是我们也应该看到，美国加剧国际紧张局势的政策并没有改变，它还坚持它的所谓“实力”政策，并且继续加紧扩军备战。因此，我们在争取继续和缓国际紧张局势的同时，也要估计到美国侵略集团进行战争冒险的可能性。为此，我们必须继续加强国防，壮大我们的力量，在这里有决定性意义的就是加速进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设，提早和超额完成第一个五年计划。同时，我们要进一步发展和巩固社会主义阵营的团结和合作。苏联和欧洲人民民主国家去年5月在华沙缔结了八国友好合作互助条约，最近又在布拉格召开了这一条约参加国的政治协商委员会会议，这对于加强他们之间的团结，对于维护他们本身的安全和欧洲和平，都有着极重大的意义。中国人民将永远同苏联和各人民民主国家站在一起，任何力量也破坏不了我们之间的团结和友谊。我们也要加强同一切爱好和平的国家和人民的团结，开展同世界各国的友好来往和各方面的联系，积极支持世界人民的和平运动，同美国的侵略政策和战争政策进行坚决的斗争。（全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们相信，在社会主义阵营各国日益强大和世界人民日益把保卫和平的事业掌握在自己手里的情况下，侵略集团的战争冒险是能够制止的。另一方面也应该指出，我们要求和平，但是，如果国际侵略集团把战争强加在我们头上的话，我们也并不惧怕战争。两次世界大战都没有替发动战争的国家带来好处。第一次世界大战的结果，世界上出现了第一个社会主义国家；第二次世界大战的结果，在欧洲和亚洲又出现了一系列的社会主义国家和许多由民族主义者领导的国家。如果侵略集团敢于发动第三次世界大战，那么可以断言，失败的将不仅是这一个或那一个帝国主义国家，而是整个帝国主义体系。（热烈鼓掌）历史的教训和目前的现实应该使好战分子清醒一些了。战争和战争威胁是永远吓不倒中国人民的。（热烈鼓掌）中国人民将坚持不渝地为继续和缓国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平而努力。
    关于我国目前国内状况，它的特点正如毛泽东主席所说的，是“处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中”。（热烈鼓掌）
    全国人民奔向社会主义，到处都出现一片欢欣鼓舞的景象。（鼓掌）全国几万万农民行动起来，响应中国共产党和毛主席的号召，实行农业合作化，掀起了农业的社会主义改造的高潮。（热烈鼓掌）全国手工业的合作化和资本主义工商业的全行业公私合营也跟着进到了高潮。（热烈鼓掌）在北京、上海、天津、沈阳、重庆、西安、武汉、广州等大城市，资本主义工商业的全部公私合营、手工业的全部合作化和整个郊区农业的合作化已经陆续实现。（热烈鼓掌）我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的第三年任务已经胜利完成。（热烈鼓掌）在全国的社会主义革命的高潮中，我国工人阶级的劳动积极性空前地高涨着。全国工人群众正在为超额完成1956年计划和提前完成第一个五年计划，进行广泛的社会主义竞赛。（全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声）同时，彻底肃清反革命分子的斗争已经在机关内和社会上有步骤地展开。（鼓掌）马克思列宁主义的学习运动也正在广泛地发展。（鼓掌）所有这一切，都反映着全国人民的社会主义积极性正在空前高涨。（热烈鼓掌）我们有理由相信，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划整个地将要提早和超额完成，我们国家在完成过渡时期的总任务方面，也将获得更可靠的保证。（全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声）
    现在可以清楚地看到，农业的社会主义改造能够提早完成。到1955年12月底为止，全国农业生产合作社已经增加到190多万个，入社农户达到7，000多万户，已经占全国农户总数的60％以上。再有1956年一年，就可以基本上完成半社会主义的农业合作化。然后再经过两年，即到1958年，就可以基本上完成全社会主义的农业合作化。（热烈鼓掌）
    我国农业合作化已经有相当长的历史。它经过三个发展步骤。早在中华人民共和国成立以前，在许多革命根据地中，就大量地出现了带有社会主义萌芽的农业生产互助组，在个别地区已经产生了半社会主义的农业生产合作社和完全社会主义的农业生产合作社。现在，我国农业生产合作社还处在它的初级形式和由初级形式向高级形式过渡的时期，而农业生产互助组已经绝大部分地进入了初级社。不难了解，农业生产合作社由初级社升高级社是一个必然的趋势。只要如全国农业发展纲要（草案）所规定的升社的各项主要条件都具备了，农民们就会自然而然地要求改变这种生产资料的半私有制，以便进一步解放生产力，使生产获得更大更快的发展。
    面临着全国农业合作化的高潮和它正在引起的全国农业生产的高潮，中共中央政治局提出了一个关于1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要的草案，向全国各级党的组织和工人、农民、科学家、各界爱国人士征求意见。
    对于这个草案可能有两种担心：有的人可能认为这个草案所规定的指标保守了，担心会束缚了农民增产的积极性；也有的人可能认为这个草案所提出来的任务太大了，担心农民的“负担”过重了。我想，第一种担心是不必要的，因为这个草案是目前我们发展农业的最低纲领；如果在实践的过程中，由于整个国民经济的发展和广大农民积极性的发挥，提前和超额完成了这一计划，那正是我们要争取的目标。
    关于第二种担心，我们可以简单地考察一下农民的力量。现在全国有将近12，000万农户，每户如果按一个半劳动力计算，全国就有18，000万个劳动力。按照农业发展纲要的要求，每户一个男劳动力一年做250个工作日，一个女劳动力一年做120个工作日，合计每户一年就有370个工作日，全国一年就有444亿个工作日。农民直接用于田间的劳动，大约占他们全部工作日的三分之二。这样，全国农民每年就还有148亿个工作日，可以用于其他各项增产措施和政治、经济、文化、教育、卫生等项工作。同时，随着农业生产的发展，合作社农民的收入将大大增加，合作社的公共积累也将日益扩大，这就有可能将一部分资金投入农业的基本建设，创造扩大再生产的条件。在全国农业合作社大发展和农业增产的条件下，如果每个男女劳动力一年的工作日能够达到农业发展纲要规定的指标，那么，每个农户每月就可以有30元到60元的收入。因此，资金的来源也不会有多少困难。
    当然，要完全实现这个农业发展纲要，还必须进行很多科学研究工作，还必须全国各界的通力合作和各部门的互相配合。我们相信，在座的各位在完成这个伟大任务的斗争中也一定不会吝惜贡献出自己的力量。（热烈鼓掌）
    我国手工业的社会主义改造的高潮也已经开始到来了。到1955年12月底为止，全国已有手工业合作社7万多个，社员200多万人，约占手工业从业人员785万人的25％强。再经过两年即到1957年，就可以基本上完成手工业的社会主义改造。
    我国手工业是很发达的，在国民经济中占有重要地位。它们是现代工业的有力助手，在为国家和人民的需要服务方面起着积极的作用。手工业的生产比农业集中，商品性大，改变所有制比较容易，广大手工业劳动者走社会主义道路的积极性也很高。因此，完成手工业的社会改造和技术改造的时间，可能而且应该比农业稍快一些。
    同时，我们也要注意到，我国手工业有经营分散、散布面广、行业复杂、一般技术落后、社会经济性质不同等特点。因此，在进行社会改造和技术改造的全面规划的时候，不仅要使它的规模和速度同农业和资本主义工商业的改造的规模和速度相适应，而且更重要的是必须掌握手工业各种不同的复杂情况，正确地执行对手工业的社会主义改造的政策。在手工业劳动者组织起来以后，要充分利用地方原料，利用废品废料，增加产品品种，提高产品质量，降低生产成本，生产更多更好更符合国家和人民需要的产品。应该注意保持过去手工业者十分关心他们自己的产品质量和市场销路的优点。在合作化以后，凡是不宜于集体生产的，就应该保持分散生产的形式。对于手工业的产品，国家只能将那些适合于由国家包销的产品，进行加工订货，大部分产品还应该由手工业合作社或者手工业者根据原有的市场联系和新的市场需要，自己推销。还应该注意某些手工业在手工艺方面所具有的特殊性质和历史传统，在合作化以后，必须使它的工艺水平更加提高，优良的历史传统能够保存下来并且得到发扬。有些特殊好的手工业和手工艺业，如果一时不易组织合作，就让他们单干；如果在加入合作社后，一时难于调整，就让他们原封不动，待摸清情况后再行调整。总之，手工业在改造以后，品种只许加多，不许减少；货色只许更好，不许变坏；技术只许提高，不许降低。同时，更应该注意把手工业的供产销计划尽可能地纳入国家的首先是地方的工业计划之内，防止由于改造而使生产脱节。只有这样，才能够积极发挥手工业对于现代工业的助手作用，才能够表现出社会主义制度的优越性。（鼓掌）
    在农业合作化迅速发展的影响下，我国资本主义工商业的社会主义改造也进入了一个新的阶段，就是在一切私营企业中分别在各地区实行按行业的全部公私合营的阶段。到1955年12月底为止，资本主义大型工业以产值计算，已有半数以上实行公私合营；资本主义商业以营业额计算，已有30％以上实行公私合营。进入1956年以后，全国大中城市就都掀起了资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的高潮。
    在一切私营企业中实行按行业的全部公私合营，这是国家资本主义的高级形式，这是资本主义所有制过渡到社会主义所有制的有决定意义的一个步骤。我们国家自成立以来，就开始采取国家资本主义的各种不同形式，对资本主义工商业进行社会主义的改造。但是，由于这些改造大部分还是采取国家资本主义的初级形式，例如加工、定货、统购、包销、经销、代销等等，对于资本主义生产关系的改变还不很大，私营企业中的生产力就仍然受着这种生产关系的束缚。随着国民经济的有计划的发展，随着社会主义经济的优越性的发扬，资本主义企业中的生产力和生产关系的矛盾就特别突出地暴露了出来。现在实行按行业的全部公私合营，由国家按照国民经济计划和社会主义的经营方法进行有计划的企业改造，并且主要地采取定股定息的办法来处理资本家的生产资料所有制，这样，资本主义生产关系就基本上改变了，剩下的只是给予资本家以一定的股息了。
    中国民族工商业者所以能够这样踊跃地接受社会主义改造，中国共产党和国家的政策起了决定的作用。人民政府大力地优先地发展了社会主义经济和合作社经济，同时采取了一系列的步骤，使资本主义经济一步一步地变为受国家管理的、受国营经济领导的、受工人阶级监督的国家资本主义经济。随着社会主义经济的繁荣滋长，随着私营企业内积极要求实现社会主义的工人店员群众的督促，随着农业社会主义改造的迅速发展，民族工商业者也日益觉悟到在中国不可能走资本主义道路，而只能接受改造，通过和平转变，走社会主义道路。我们国家所采取的对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造方案，也是民族工商业者能够接受的，因为国家在处理资本主义所有制上面，还给这些工商业者以一定时期的股息，同时，在全行业的公私合营中，还进行全面的人事安排。这样，就使民族工商业者看到，在将来资本主义所有制完全消灭以后，他们的工作和生活是有充分保障的。在政治上，我们国家不仅给民族工商业者以选举权，而且积极地向他们进行思想教育，使他们懂得必须遵照社会发展规律才能掌握自己的命运，并且帮助他们自觉地实行自我改造，以便由今天的剥削者变成明天的劳动者。（热烈鼓掌）
    应该指出，目前正在全国展开的私营工商业的社会主义改造的高潮，还只是进一步深入改造的开始。我国除了大型的私营工商业户以外，有几十万分散的中型的和小型的工商业户，在这样短短的时间内，只能首先在法律上批准公私合营，在合营以后，还有清产核资、经济改组、企业改造、生产安排和人事安排等等一系列的工作要去认真地进行和完成。在进行这些工作的时候，必须十分注意不要轻易改变原有企业的经营管理办法，并且必须善于保存原有经营方法中一切好的经验，作为历史遗产加以继承和发扬。对于数量极大、分布极广的小商店，在合营以后，应该继续实行代销和拿手续费的办法。代销也可以做为公私合营的一种形式，因为它的货源主要是由国家供应的，进销计划是国家批准的，企业是专业公司领导的，而手续费又类似社会主义企业中的计件工资制度。对于那些分散的肩挑小贩，不要急于改变他们的经营方式，因为这种经营方式对人民是方便的，也是受人民欢迎的，应该在长时期内将它保留下来。总之，我们对资本主义工商业进行改造的基本目的是为了改变生产关系，解放生产力，它的最终表现是生产的发展和提高。因此，在实行合营的过程中，最重要的问题是保证生产和营业的正常进行，绝不允许在生产和经营上发生混乱现象，造成国家和社会财富的损失。合营企业的职工、工程技术人员和工商业者，必须注意保持原有的好的品种、货色和质量，决不许可不经领导机关批准，随意并厂并店和调整商业网，轻易改变服务制度和人事制度。应该在中央和地方统一的领导和安排下，有计划有步骤地进行各方面的改革工作，以保证社会主义的改造工作能够继续健康地向前发展。希望到会的各有关方面的委员，分别向广大职工、工程技术人员和工商业者讲清楚这些道理，协助政府做好这一工作。（鼓掌）
    以上所说的农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的状况，表明我国在进行社会主义革命也就是进行社会主义改造的途程上，已经向前迈进了一大步。可以说，在社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争中，胜负是已经被决定了。（经久不息的热烈鼓掌）这正如毛泽东主席所说：“目前我们国家的政治形势已经起了根本的变化。”（经久不息的热烈鼓掌）
    马克思列宁主义早就指出过，在工人阶级领导的政权下，资本主义制度有可能在特定条件下和平地过渡到社会主义制度。我国人民的实践光辉地证实了这一可能。（鼓掌）日益巩固的工人阶级领导的国家权力，日益发展的社会主义经济，日益强大的以工农联盟为基础并有民族资产阶级参加的我国人民民主统一战线，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的存在和它对于我国的巨大援助，以及其他有利的国际条件，这一切，就是我国能够和平地过渡到社会主义社会的条件和保证。
    说到我国社会主义改造事业在最近时期得到特别迅速发展的原因，那么，除了应该指出这是过去六年来我国人民在中国共产党和政府的领导下所进行的各项工作的综合结果以外，还应该特别指出，这是同最近时期中共中央在各方面工作中进行了反对右倾保守思想的斗争分不开的。广大的人民群众的社会主义觉悟性已经日益成熟，但是右倾保守主义者却看不到这种积极性，压制这种积极性。在扫除了这种障碍以后，社会主义改造运动就迅速地发展起来，像潮水一样，奔腾前进，超过了一切原有的预料。所以毛泽东主席说：“大约再有三年的时间，社会主义革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成。”（长时间的热烈掌声）
    社会主义改造事业的规模和速度，既然大大地超过了第一个五年计划所规定的指标，这就为我国社会主义工业化的加速发展和国民经济的新的高涨提供了有利的条件。
    我们已经胜利地完成了第一个五年计划的第三个年度计划。根据现有统计材料，1955年的工业总产值超额完成了计划，比1952年增长62％。1955年的农业生产得到了空前的丰收，粮食产量达到3，650亿斤，比丰收的1952年增产了372亿斤；棉花产量达到3，006万担，比丰收的1952年增产了396万担；粮食和棉花两类主要的农作物，在1955年都比中国历史上的最高年产量超过了很多。1955年的基本建设也取得了很多的成绩，特别是在节约方面的成绩更加显著。1955年的其他经济事业和科学、文化、教育、卫生等事业也有了相应的发展。
    1956年将是我国的国民经济特别活跃和趋于全面高涨的一年。根据初步拟定的1956年的计划，同1955年相比，工业总产值将增长18．6％；农业中的粮食产量将增长约9％，棉花产量将增长约18％；基本建设投资额将增长60％左右；其他经济事业和科学、文化、教育、卫生等事业也将采取比较快的速度向前发展。只要没有特大的天灾，只要我们努力地完成了1956年的计划，我国就有可能在主要的指标方面，提前半年至一年完成第一个五年计划。（热烈鼓掌）
    现在，摆在全国人民面前的问题，是要把各项建设事业做得又多、又快、又好、又省，以便使各项事业的发展，适应已经变化了的情况，适应国家和人民的需要。我们应该努力去做那些客观上经过努力可以做到的事情，不这样做，就要犯右倾保守的错误；我们也应该注意避免超越现实条件所许可的范围，不勉强去做那些客观上做不到的事情，否则就要犯盲目冒进的错误。
    当然，提早和超额完成五年计划，不是单靠口号、号召、决议所能实现的，这需要在各部门的工作中采取一系列具体的措施，需要改善各部门的领导，需要到群众里面去进行大量的实际工作，发现和推广先进经验，使落后的变为先进，先进的变为更先进。关于这个问题，我不打算在这里多说。我只想在这里说明一点，就是尽管许多企业已经找到了并且实行了提前和超额完成五年计划的办法，而且有许多企业已经跑在原定的时间表的前面，但是至今还有不少企业的生产状况是很落后的。这些企业的领导人员在反对保守主义的潮流中也修改了一些定额，这些新的定额在他们看来似乎已经是先进的了，但是只要认真组织群众去讨论，同真正先进的定额比较一下，就知道他们仍然是很保守的，他们并没有真正努力去挖掘自己的生产潜力。他们并没有全面地完成计划的指标，并且常常用完成产品数量和产值的指标的形式，掩盖着没有完成产品的质量、品种和成本的指标的实质。有些落后的企业领导者，看到旁的企业跑到前面去了，并不向这些先进的企业学习，反而忙于替自己寻找辩护落后的借口，甚至想：既然别的许多企业已经提前和超额完成五年计划，那么，虽然有少数企业落后，五年计划的总指标总还是超过了！各部门的领导者的责任，就是要向这种安于落后的人们展开批评，不要采取妥协态度，不要让他们占先进生产者的便宜，而要利用先进者的榜样，促使落后者脱离落后状态。只有这样，领导者才证明他不是右倾保守主义者，不是右倾保守主义者的保护者，才正确地尽了政府给他的领导的责任。只有这样，我们才有可能确实地、全面地提早和超额完成五年计划。
    提早完成社会主义改造，提早和超额完成第一个五年计划，这就使我们有可能超额完成我国过渡时期的工业发展计划和加速进行国民经济的技术改造。最近，国家计划委员会正在会同各部门和各省、市、自治区在拟定十五年远景规划的基础上，着手草拟我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划纲要，以便能够指导各项经济事业和文化事业的加快发展。
    为着完成上述任务，不仅要依靠工人阶级和广大农民的创造性的劳动，而且要充分动员和发挥我国知识分子的力量。我们这次会议准备着重地讨论关于知识分子问题，因此，我现在要对这一问题多说几句。
    什么是当前的知识分子问题呢？这就是我国知识分子的现有力量，无论在数量方面、在业务水平方面、在政治觉悟方面，都还不能适应社会主义事业急速发展的需要；而若干政府部门对于知识分子的使用和待遇还有某些不合理现象，又在不同程度上妨碍了知识分子力量的充分发挥。这就需要我们加强领导，克服缺点，采取一系列有效的措施，最充分地动员和发挥现有知识分子的力量，不断地提高他们的政治觉悟和业务水平，大规模地培养新生力量来扩大他们的队伍，以适应国家对于知识分子的不断增长的要求。
    在过去六年来，我国知识界的面貌，已经发生了根本的变化。现有知识分子的绝大多数已经成为国家工作人员，已经为社会主义服务，已经是工人阶级的一部分。他们一般地都参加了政治学习、社会改革斗争和思想改造运动。知识分子的队伍在过去六年中也有了迅速的扩大，已有相当数量的劳动阶级出身的知识分子补充到他们的队伍里来。由于广大知识分子特别是高级知识分子的努力，在过去六年中，我国科学、文化、教育、卫生等事业有了巨大的发展，我国知识分子的业务水平也有了显著的提高。但是，从整个说来，我国科学和技术的状况仍然是落在世界先进水平的后面很远。我们必须动员知识分子的一切力量，在不太长的时间内赶上世界的先进的科学文化水平。这是我国人民首先是知识分子的一个伟大的光荣的战斗的任务。（经久不息的热烈鼓掌）
    一般地说，我国知识分子的力量在中国共产党和政府的领导下已被动员起来了。在这方面，各民主党派和人民团体，也做了不少工作。但是，不能否认，我们某些国家机关和国家工作人员由于低估了知识分子的进步，低估了他们在社会主义事业中的作用，在对待知识分子方面还有一些缺点。在这里，主要的问题是：第一，应该改善对知识分子的使用和安排，使他们能够发挥对于国家有益的专长；第二，应该对知识分子给以应有的信任和支持，使他们能够积极地放手地工作；第三，应该给知识分子以必要的工作条件和适当待遇，使他们能够集中主要精力于自己的业务。
    现代科学和技术正在一日千里地突飞猛进，原子能的发现和利用以及电子学的进一步发展和运用，使人类面临着一个新的工业革命的前夕。我国人民，首先是知识分子已经到了向现代科学大进军的时候。我们必须制订科学发展的全面规划，加强和扩大科学研究机构，大量培养科学研究人材，为发展科学事业准备一切必要的条件。国家计划委员会正在会同科学院和各部拟制1956年到1967年我国科学发展的远景计划。这个远景计划的出发点，是要按照需要和可能，把世界科学的最先进成就尽可能迅速地介绍到我国来，把我国科学事业方面最短缺而又最急需的门类尽可能迅速地补足起来，根据世界科学已有的成就来安排和规划我国的科学研究工作，争取在第三个五年计划期末使我国最急需的科学部门能够接近世界先进水平。（热烈鼓掌）
    帮助知识分子进行自我改造，对于充分动员和发挥知识分子力量，具有极其重大的意义。我国知识分子的大多数都已经或者正在站到社会主义方面来，但是他们中间许多人在思想和行动方面还不可避免地存在着不同程度的资产阶级观点和作风。在知识界的队伍中，也还有一小部分人不了解社会主义，甚至在思想上反对社会主义。此外，还有百分之几的反革命分子和其他坏分子。我们除了必须彻底肃清暗藏在知识界的现行反革命分子以外，还应该使落后分子减少到最低限度，使中间分子尽可能成为先进分子，使先进分子成为完全社会主义的知识分子。我们希望，我国知识分子能够在中国共产党的领导下，采取自我教育的方法，通过社会生活的观察和实践、业务的实践和马克思列宁主义理论的学习这样三个互相联系的途径，逐步地成长为全心全意地为社会主义服务的知识分子。（鼓掌）
    我们相信，我国知识分子将进一步团结在中国共产党的周围，为提高我国的科学文化水平而奋斗。（鼓掌）我国工人、农民和知识分子在社会主义事业中的联盟将一天比一天巩固。（鼓掌）我们依靠这个联盟的力量，一定可以超额完成我国的工业发展计划和加速进行国民经济的技术改造。（热烈鼓掌）
    我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的事业正在以更大的速度和规模向前发展，我们的国家将有可能在一个不很长的时间内，以一个完全现代化的、有高度文化的、富强的、社会主义工业大国出现于世界。（全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声）我国人民引为自豪的就是，有如毛泽东主席所说：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”（全场响起了经久不息的热烈掌声）
    但是，我国人民没有权利忘记，在我们面前还站着帝国主义，还有反革命分子进行破坏活动，还有我国的领土台湾没有解放。这就需要我们更加巩固人民民主专政，更加巩固工人、农民和知识分子的联盟，更加巩固以中国共产党为首的人民民主统一战线，以便用全国人民团结一致的力量去进行保卫祖国和保卫社会主义事业的斗争。我们必须团结一致，继续进行反对帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的斗争，为我国社会主义事业争取一个持久的国际和平环境。我们必须团结一致，继续进行肃清机关内和社会上暗藏的反革命分子的斗争，保卫我国社会主义事业不受到反革命活动的危害。我们必须团结一致，继续进行解放台湾的斗争，使台湾归还祖国，实现中国的完全统一。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    在这里，我要讲一讲解放台湾的问题。
    当我们伟大祖国人民正在奔向社会主义的时候，800万台湾同胞却仍然受着外国的武力统治，不能同祖国人民一道前进。因此，不言而喻地，祖国人民不能不十分关怀台湾同胞的命运，而台湾同胞眼看着祖国日益兴旺，也一定感到振奋，期待着早日回到祖国的怀抱。（鼓掌）
    为什么台湾直到今天还不能获得解放呢？如前所说，主要的原因是美国使用武力侵占台湾，干涉中国内政，把台湾变成了它的军事基地。这就造成了台湾地区长期的紧张局势，而阻碍了台湾的解放。
    但是，不管怎样，台湾是中国的神圣领土，台湾同胞是中国人民不可分离的一部分，台湾的解放不论采取任何方式，都是中国内部的事务。这是没有任何人能够否认的。我们全体中国人民，包括大陆人民和台湾人民，应该在爱国主义旗帜下团结起来，共同努力来自己解决这个属于我国内部的事务。我们决不允许任何第三者来干涉我国这个内部事务，任何第三者也没有权利来干涉我国这个内部事务。（热烈鼓掌）大家知道，在大陆解放的时候，北京、绥远、湖南、新疆、西藏等地方都是用和平方式解放的，而和平起义的军队已经成为解放军的一部分，和平起义的将领一直担负着国家的重要职务。我国政府一年来曾经再三指出：除了用战争方式解放台湾以外，还存在着用和平方式解放台湾的可能性。这样，我国大陆人民和台湾人民就有一种共同的爱国的责任，这就是除了积极准备在必要的时候用战争方式解放台湾以外，努力争取用和平方式解放台湾。（鼓掌）
    台湾同胞今天所受的灾难是极其深重的。他们刚刚从旧的殖民统治之下解脱出来，不久就被投入美国武力统治的深渊。美国已经控制了台湾的军事、政治和经济，掠夺着台湾的丰富资源，榨取着台湾同胞的膏血，并且驱使着台湾同胞充当美国的炮灰。在这种暗无天日的外国武力统治之下，台湾现在是工商凋敝，农村破产，台湾同胞过着贫穷、饥饿和恐怖的痛苦生活。我们相信，具有争取自由和解放的革命传统的台湾同胞，是决不甘心过这种外力统治下的奴隶生活的。（热烈鼓掌）
    同时，我们也相信，所有从大陆上跑到台湾的国民党军政人员，他们追随美国维持着的苟延残喘的局面，无论如何是不能持久的。历史证明，侵略者必然失败，而投靠侵略者以图苟延残喘的人不是跟着失败，就是被人牺牲。现在，国民党军政人员上上下下都是惊惶不安，悲观失望，内部分崩离析，统治日益动摇，这就是他们目前的局面不能持久的证明。在这种趋势下，国民党军政人员只有在下面两条道路中选择其一：一条是继续追随美国，陷台湾同胞于外力统治的惨境，同时，也使自己走上死亡无日的绝路；一条是幡然悔悟，激发爱国良心，通过和平途径解放台湾，使台湾同胞回到祖国怀抱，也使自己有获得祖国人民宽恕的机会。
    无论如何，中国人民一定要解放台湾，台湾最后亦必然归还祖国。（全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声）国民党军政人员如果看清这个大势，愿意通过和平途径解放台湾，帮助祖国消除台湾地区的紧张局势，实现伟大祖国的完全统一，那么，不仅对祖国立了功勋，而且对亚洲和世界的和平也作了贡献。
    中国人民和中国共产党是一贯主张全民族团结、一致对外的。在中国历史上，中国共产党和国民党有过两次合作关系。在这两次合作中，共产党人和国民党人都曾经并肩作战，共同反对帝国主义。就是在第三次国内革命战争中，中国共产党一面进行解放战争，一面也一直没有放弃和平谈判的努力。现在，跑到台湾的国民党军政人员中，愿意通过和平途径回到祖国大陆上的人一定是不少的。他们都有家族或者亲友住在大陆，许多人想回到大陆来同自己家族或者亲友团聚。我们号召一切跑到台湾和海外的国民党军政人员，莫再迟疑，早日走和平解放台湾的道路！因此，我代表中国人民和中国政府在这里宣布：凡是愿意回到大陆省亲会友的，都可以回到大陆上来。凡是愿意到大陆来参观和学习的，也都可以到大陆上来。凡是愿意走和平解放台湾道路的，不管任何人，也不管他们过去犯过多大罪过，中国人民都将宽大对待，不究既往。凡是在和平解放台湾这个行动中立了功的，中国人民都将按照立功大小给以应得的奖励。凡是通过和平途径投向祖国的，中国人民都将在工作上给以适当的安置。（鼓掌）
    台湾同胞和一切从大陆上跑到台湾的人员，站到爱国主义旗帜下来，同祖国人民一起，为争取和平解放台湾、实现祖国的完全统一而奋斗吧！（长时间的热烈掌声）
    同志们！朋友们！我要结束我的报告了。
    我国人民正在社会主义道路上大踏步地前进。在社会主义旗帜下，我国人民已经开始向科学进军！向消灭阶级和剥削、落后和贫困的根源进军！（热烈鼓掌）我们正在取得社会主义革命的伟大胜利，而且一定能够取得这个革命的完全、彻底的胜利。（热烈鼓掌）我们全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、海外华侨和一切爱国人士，必须更加紧密地团结起来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，进行紧张的工作和创造性的劳动，力戒任何的浮夸和骄傲，为争取继续和缓国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平而奋斗，为努力完成国家在过渡时期的总任务和提高我国的科学文化水平而奋斗，为争取和平解放台湾、实现祖国的完全统一而奋斗。（全场响起了暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）
