    Making Meritorious Contributions in the Socialist Transformation
    Tianjin Daily Reporter
    By the 14th, over 26,000 private factories and stores in more than 100 industrial and commercial sectors in Tianjin had all implemented joint state-private ownership. From this point on, in this second largest industrial and commercial city in the country, "capitalist enterprise" has become a term of historical significance.
    This is a major change in Tianjin's history, and a great victory for the Party in implementing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.
    In mid-December of last year, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee's expanded meeting stipulated that the pace of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce throughout the city should be accelerated. Following this, the relevant departments rapidly carried out a series of tasks. The district Party committees organized a propaganda team of more than 13,000 people, using various methods to vigorously promote the Party's principles and policies on the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce to more than 100,000 employees of joint state-private enterprises and private factories and stores throughout the city. Tens of thousands of government cadres and people from all walks of life also engaged in studying the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Through these propaganda and study sessions, a unified ideological understanding was reached within the Party and the working class. The socialist enthusiasm of the vast number of private enterprise employees soared to unprecedented levels. Especially after the instructions given by Chairman Mao during a symposium with the executive committee members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce were widely disseminated among the 40,000 to 50,000 private industrialists and businessmen in the city, it provided a profound education. "Listen to Chairman Mao, follow the socialist road" became their common slogan.
    The socialist enthusiasm of workers and capitalists soared to unprecedented levels, and the pace of transformation work also accelerated. Inspiring good news came one after another. At the end of last year, the 158 private stores in the pastry industry were the first to implement joint state-private ownership across the entire sector. On January 7th of this year, more than 50 private industrial and commercial sectors across the city applied for joint state-private ownership. On the 9th, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee approved the implementation of joint state-private ownership across all private commercial sectors, and on the 14th, all industrial sectors were approved for joint state-private ownership.
    The Party's policy of peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has deeply resonated with the people. For more than a month, from morning to night, capitalists from various sectors rushed to the district people's committees and relevant departments to apply for joint state-private ownership. In order to assist the government in doing a good job in the work of joint state-private ownership, progressive elements in the industrial and commercial community also organized a socialist transformation work team of more than 2,000 people. Their desire is: "Do more good deeds and strive to make meritorious contributions in the socialist transformation."
    During the preparations for joint state-private ownership in various sectors, capitalists from more than 70 sectors made guarantees. They guaranteed to obey the leadership of the working class and the supervision of the state-owned economy, guaranteed not to withdraw funds or place personal connections during the period of joint operation; after the enterprises were jointly operated, they would obey planning and obey transfer. Many capitalists also took the initiative to invest in enterprises, expressing their determination to accept socialist transformation. Liu Shuyong, manager of the Sino-British Trading Company, and two others invested all of their accumulated dividends of 100,000 yuan into the enterprise after it was approved for joint state-private ownership. They said: "This is an investment for socialism, an investment for a happy tomorrow."
    In this hot tide of socialist transformation, the hundreds of thousands of employees of private industry and commerce in Tianjin played a huge role in promoting it. "Hoping today, hoping tomorrow, hoping during the day, hoping at night," the workers' eagerness for joint state-private ownership was extremely urgent. Many employees ran to the district Party committees and district trade union offices time and again to inquire about the news of joint state-private ownership in their enterprises; many employees actively worked hard in production to create conditions for joint state-private ownership. Some employees who did not like to participate in activities in the past also became active. In the past, the Workers' Cultural Center in the Third District issued 700 tickets for each meeting, and only more than 500 people attended; recently, at a meeting to promote the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, another 700 tickets were issued, but the number of attendees greatly exceeded the number of tickets, and many people were standing outside the auditorium. Some small factories in the knitting industry have not been able to organize competitions for several years. Recently, the employees automatically signed competition contracts and launched competitions, and the processing tasks were always completed ahead of schedule. Many factories and stores have drawn a portion of their employees to participate in the preparatory work for joint state-private ownership, and those who remained have taken on their work. In the recent few days, more than 1,000 youth shock teams, with more than 14,000 people participating, were organized by young employees and shop assistants in more than 70 sectors such as department stores, shoe and hat stores, cotton weaving, and dyeing and finishing to support the joint state-private ownership work of the entire industry.
    With the advent of the high tide of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, Tianjin's face is changing day by day. In the stores that have already implemented joint state-private ownership and are preparing for joint state-private ownership, people wearing badges with the words "Launch a Good Service Movement" can be seen everywhere. Together with many private sector personnel who never came to the counter before, they stand in front of the counter, warmly welcoming customers. The salespersons' slogan is "Answer all questions without getting annoyed, let customers choose as they wish, and serve customers sincerely." In the Xinfu Cotton Cloth Store on Xinhua North Road in Heping District, a customer came to buy 2.5 meters of long-staple plush for a coat lining. The salesperson saw that his size would not require so much, so he asked him to go to the clothing store to measure it before buying. The customer went to the clothing store and measured it, and the result was still too much. The salesperson ran to Shandong Road and found the master craftsman from the clothing workshop attached to the store to re-measure the customer's size, and 1.8 meters was enough, thus saving the customer 15 yuan. In many joint state-private stores, people can also see that the goods are much more complete than in the past. In the past, many cotton cloth stores were small, with little capital, and did not carry a full range of products, and the shelves were often empty. On the same night that the silk and cloth industry was approved for joint state-private ownership across the entire industry, the joint state-private cotton cloth main stores in various districts rushed to allocate goods to the various outlets overnight. The next day, which was the first day of officially hanging the "Joint State-Private Ownership" sign, the shelves were filled with colorful fabrics. After joint state-private ownership in many sectors, the original excellent operating characteristics and traditions have also been preserved and developed. The master craftsmen of Xiangdezhai Pastry Shop, which has 80 years of history, also took out their skills and patiently taught them to the employees of this store and other pastry shops. After the joint operation, the technical workers in many pastry shops also made many new pastries for the citizens.
    In the factories that have implemented joint state-private ownership and are preparing for joint operation, the good news of production comes one after another. In 8 industrial sectors, the employees of more than 500 factories have already launched or are launching competitions. After the North China Vegetable Oil Factory and three other oil factories implemented merging and joint operation, the employees also decided to launch a competition to increase the oil yield and strive to produce more than 90,000 catties of oil this year.
    The great progress in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has become a happy event for the people of the city. Workers from state-owned enterprises sent congratulatory teams to congratulate the employees of joint state-private enterprises. In the newly opened stores, customers congratulated the salespersons as soon as they entered the door. Suburban farmers braved the severe cold to deliver vegetables to the city. They happily said to the employees of the melon and vegetable industry: We are carrying out cooperativization in the countryside, and you are carrying out socialist transformation in the city. Both the city and the countryside are doing things according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Now, the two ends are aligned.

    在改造事业中立功
    天津日报记者
    到14日，天津市100多个工商业行业的26，000多个私营工厂和商店，全部实行了公私合营。从此，在这个全国第二的大工商业城市里，“资本主义企业”已经成为历史上的名词了。
    这是天津市历史上的大变化，是党对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的伟大胜利。
    去年12月中旬，中共天津市委扩大会议曾规定了要加快全市资本主义工商业改造的速度。这以后，各个有关部门迅速地进行了一系列的工作。各区区委组织了13，000多人的宣传队伍，利用各种方式，向全市公私合营和私营工厂商店的10多万职工，大张旗鼓地宣传了党对私营工商业社会主义改造的方针政策，几万机关干部和各界人士，也进行了关于资本主义工商业改造的学习。经过这些宣传学习，在党和工人阶级内部统一了思想认识。广大私营企业职工的社会主义热情空前高涨。特别是在全市四、五万私营工商业者中间，广泛地传达了毛主席邀集全国工商联执行委员座谈时所作的指示以后，给予了广大工商业者以深刻的教育。“听毛主席的话，走社会主义的路”，成为他们的共同口号。
    职工和资本家的社会主义积极性空前高涨起来了，改造工作的速度也加快了。振奋人心的捷报一个接着一个传来。去年年底，糕点业的158家私营商店第一个全行业实行公私合营，今年1月7日，全市就有50多个私营工商业行业申请公私合营，9日，天津市人民委员会批准了全部私营商业行业实行公私合营，14日全部工业行业被批准公私合营了。
    党对资本主义工商业和平改造的方针，深入人心。1个多月以来，从早晨到夜晚，在各区人民委员会，在各个有关部门，各行业的资本家争先恐后地前往申请公私合营。为了协助政府做好公私合营工作，工商界中的进步分子还组织了一支2，000多人的社会主义改造工作队，他们的愿望是：“多做好事，争取在改造事业中立功。”
    在各个行业筹备公私合营期间，有70多个行业的资本家提出了保证。他们保证服从工人阶级的领导和国营经济的监督，保证在合营期间不抽逃资金，不安插私人；在企业合营以后，服从规划，服从调动。许多资本家还主动向企业投资，表示自己接受社会主义改造的决心。中英贸易行经理刘树墉等3人，在企业被批准公私合营后，把历年分得的红利10万元，全部投入企业，他们说：“这是为社会主义投资，为幸福的明天投资”。
    在这热火朝天的社会主义改造高潮中，天津市私营工商业十几万职工发挥了巨大的推动作用。“今天盼、明天盼、白天盼、黑夜盼”，职工们盼望公私合营的心情十分迫切。许多职工一次再次跑到中共区委会、区工会办事处去打听本企业公私合营的消息；许多职工积极努力生产，为公私合营创造条件。过去有些不爱参加活动的职工，也活跃起来。三区工人文化馆，过去每次开会都是发700张票，到会的只有500多人；最近开宣传私营工商业社会主义改造大会，又发了700张票，到会的人却大大超过了票数，礼堂外面都站了许多人。针织业有些小厂几年来竞赛组织不起来，最近职工们自动订了竞赛合同，开展了竞赛，加工任务总是提前完成。许多工厂商店抽出了一部分职工参加了公私合营筹备工作，留下来的人就把他们的工作担负起来。在最近几天以内，百货、鞋帽、棉织、染整等70多个行业的青年职工、店员组织了1，000多个青年突击队，有14，000多人参加，支援了全行业公私合营工作。
    随着私营工商业社会主义改造高潮的到来，天津市的面貌日日在变化。在已经公私合营和正在筹备公私合营的商店里，到处可以看见身上佩戴着“开展服务良好运动”胸章的人，他们和许多从来不到柜上来的私方人员一起站到柜台前面，殷勤地接待顾客。售货员们的口号是“百问不烦，百挑不厌，诚恳为顾客服务。”在和平区新华北路信孚棉布店，有一个顾客来买2.5公尺的长毛绒做大衣里子，售货员看他的身量用不了这么许多，就请他到服装店去量好再买，这个顾客到服装店量过，结果还是多，售货员就跑到山东路把这个店附设的服装作坊的老师傅找来替这位顾客重新量了尺寸，只要1·8公尺就够了，这样就替顾客省了15元。在许多公私合营商店里，人们也可以看到货色比过去齐全多了。过去许多棉布店因为店小，资金少，经营品种不全，货架上时常是空空的。在绸布业被批准全行业公私合营的当天晚上，各区公私合营棉布总店连夜给各门市部拨去了货，第二天，也就是正式挂上“公私合营”牌的第一天，货架上都堆满了五色缤纷的布匹。许多行业公私合营以后，原有的优良的经营特点和传统也得到了保存和发扬。有80年历史的祥德斋糕点店的老师傅们也把自己的技术拿出来，耐心地传授给本店和别的糕点店的职工。许多糕点店的技术工人在合营以后，还为市民制造了许多新的糕点。
    在实行了公私合营和正在筹备合营的工厂里，生产的喜讯接二连三地传来。在8个工业行业中，就有500多个工厂的职工已经或正在开展竞赛。华北植物油厂和其他3个油厂实行并厂合营以后，职工们也决定开展竞赛，提高出油率，争取今年一年多出油90，000多斤。
    资本主义工商业改造工作的巨大进展，已经成为全市人民的喜事。国营企业的工人们派出了贺喜队向公私合营企业的职工们贺喜，在新挂牌的商店里，顾客一进门就给售货员们道贺。郊区农民冒着严寒给城里送菜。他们高兴地对瓜菜业的职工们说：我们农村搞合作化，你们在城里搞社会主义改造，城里乡间都按毛主席的指示办事，这下子，两头可对上头了。
