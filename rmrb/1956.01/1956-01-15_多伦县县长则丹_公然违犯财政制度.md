To the Editor:

    Doron County Magistrate Ze Dan of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Chahar League has consistently failed to comply with financial regulations. Agricultural loans, land license fees, and proceeds from the sale of public property collected by the county over the years have not been turned over as required but have instead been diverted by the county for its own use. In July 1955, the county also resisted paying legally mandated state taxes. At that time, the county held a materials exchange fair, with theatrical performances and other activities, which should have been subject to cultural and entertainment taxes. However, County Magistrate Ze Dan refused to pay the tax. The County Tax Bureau had no recourse but to consult the Chahar League Tax Bureau, which replied that the tax should be collected. The head of the County Tax Bureau personally presented the League Bureau's reply to County Magistrate Ze Dan for discussion, but the County Magistrate ignored it. Subsequently, on September 2, the Chahar League People's Committee instructed Doron County to pay taxes in accordance with the law. This instruction proved ineffective, and Ze Dan continued to resist payment. Yet the Doron County leadership was very "generous" with county expenditures. While the entire country was engaged in a comprehensive campaign to conserve and combat waste, Doron County, under the direction of County Magistrate Ze Dan and some county committee members, sent people to Zhangjiakou and other places to purchase a large number of radios, desks, chairs, and other unnecessary equipment, spending a total of 8,655 yuan, exceeding the budget approved by the higher authorities by 2,233 yuan.
    The Chahar League People's Committee is aware of the violations of national financial regulations committed by Doron County Magistrate Ze Dan and others, but they have failed to seriously address them, which is highly inappropriate.

    多伦县县长则丹
    公然违犯财政制度编辑同志：
    内蒙古自治区察哈尔盟多伦县县长则丹一贯不遵守财政制度。这个县历年收回的农业贷款、土地证照费、公产变价款等收入，没有按规定上交，都被县里擅自挪用了。1955年7月，这个县又发生了一件抗拒依法向国家交税的事件。当时县里举办了一个物资交流会，大会期间有戏剧演出等活动，按规定应该征收文化娱乐税。但是，县长则丹不同意交税。县税务局没有法子，只好请示察哈尔盟税务局。盟税务局答复说应该征收。县税务局长亲自拿上盟局的答复文件去和县长则丹研究；但是县长仍然置之不理。以后察哈尔盟人民委员会又在9月2日指示多伦县依法纳税。结果，这个指示并没有起作用，则丹仍抗拒不交。可是多伦县领导人员对县里的开支，却是非常“大方”的。正当全国开展全面节约反对浪费的时候，多伦县在县长则丹和一部分县委委员的主持下，竟派人到张家口等地购置大批收音机、桌椅等根本不需要的设备，共开支8，655元，超出上级核定的预算2，233元。
    多伦县县长则丹等人这种违犯国家财政制度的行为，察哈尔盟人民委员会是知道的，但是他们却一直没有认真进行处理，这是非常不应该的。
