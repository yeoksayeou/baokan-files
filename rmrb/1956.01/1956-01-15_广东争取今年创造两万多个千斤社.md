    Guangzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper, January 14th. The Guangdong Provincial Grain Production Conference, held in early January, revised Guangdong Province's 1956 grain production plan based on the new situation where semi-socialist agricultural cooperation can be basically achieved in Guangdong before this year's spring plowing. According to this plan, Guangdong Province must guarantee the completion of the task of increasing grain production by 4 billion jin this year, an increase of 18.5% compared to 1955. Completing this plan will fulfill the state's requirement for Guangdong Province to increase grain production by 37% during the First Five-Year Plan period.
    The conference, based on the specific conditions of Guangdong Province, proposed eight measures to increase production this year: expanding the multiple cropping area, changing the farming system, promoting advanced technology, promoting improved varieties, promoting new-style farm tools, opening up fertilizer sources, strengthening the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and organizing land reclamation. At the same time, it proposed to actively create high-yield demonstration points to drive overall progress. This year, the province will create 6 "Thousand-Jin" counties, 109 "Thousand-Jin" districts, 2,017 "Thousand-Jin" townships, and 23,637 "Thousand-Jin" cooperatives, and will carry out production competitions between cooperatives and between teams to launch a mass movement for increased production.
    Currently, China's first "Thousand-Jin High-Yield County" – Chao'an County – has revised its agricultural production plan, requiring the original target of an average of 1106.82 jin of rice per mu this year to be increased to 1130.42 jin, an increase of 11.1% compared to last year's 1017.34 jin. Boluo County has also determined to increase production by 13% this year on the basis of the 1955 bumper harvest.

    广东争取今年创造两万多个千斤社
    本报广州14日电  广东省1月初旬召开的粮食生产会议，根据广东省今年春耕以前可以基本上实现半社会主义农业合作化的新形势，修订了1956年广东省的粮食生产计划。根据这个计划，今年广东省要保证完成40亿斤粮食的增产任务，比1955年增产18.5％。完成这个计划，就完成了国家要求广东省在第一个五年计划期间增产粮食37％的任务。
    会议根据广东省的具体条件，提出了今年要扩大复种面积、改变耕作制度、推广先进技术、推广良种、推广新式农具、开辟肥源、加强防治病虫害和组织开荒等八项增产措施。同时提出要积极创造高额丰产点，以带动全面。全省今年要创造6个千斤县，109个千斤区，2，017个千斤乡，23，637个千斤社，并且要开展社与社、组与组之间的生产竞赛，以掀起一个群众性的增产运动。
    目前，我国第一个“千斤丰产县”——潮安县已经修订了农业生产计划，要求把原定今年平均每亩产稻谷1106.82斤的指标提高到1130.42斤，比去年1017.34斤增产11.1％。博罗县也确定今年要在1955年丰产的基础上增产13％。
