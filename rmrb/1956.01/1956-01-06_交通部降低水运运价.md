The Ministry of Communications Reduces Water Transport Rates

    To align with the development of socialist industrialization and the agricultural collectivization movement, the Ministry of Communications has reduced state-owned water transport rates, effective January 1, 1956.

    Following this adjustment, coastal freight rates in the Northern Seas have been reduced by an average of 10.33%; coastal freight rates in South China have been reduced by an average of 34.64%; and freight rates along the entire Yangtze River have been reduced by an average of 23.6%. In particular, freight rates for key materials for national economic construction and materials needed for agricultural collectivization, such as machinery, steel, agricultural machinery, pesticides, and necessities for people's livelihoods like grain, cotton, and cloth, have been reduced even more.
