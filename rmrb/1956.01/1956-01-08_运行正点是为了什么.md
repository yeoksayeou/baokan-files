Some dispatchers at the Jilin and Tumen dispatching offices of the Jilin Railway Bureau, in order to maintain train schedules and create "achievements" for their shifts, often refuse to load less-than-carload (LCL) freight from various stations along the line. On December 7, 1955, Wang Runzhou, a dispatcher at the Jilin dispatching office, arranged for a boxcar to load live pigs from the local products company at Yantongshan Station. He notified the local products company to quickly bring the pigs to load the car at 5:00 AM. The owner drove the live pigs from five miles away, but the dispatching office decided that the railcar could not load live pigs. Dispatcher Wang Runzhou then told the owner to load the car the next day. The owner had no choice but to drive the live pigs back to the pig farm. Because they were driven too quickly on the way there, two large, fat pigs died upon returning to the pig farm. Furthermore, in October 1955, the Tumen dispatching office also unloaded 22 pieces of cargo before they reached their destination stations, just to ensure that trains ran on schedule.

Maintaining train schedules is intended to reduce unnecessary stops at various stations along the route, increase the number of train runs, and ensure the normal exchange of industrial and agricultural products. However, the practices of the Jilin and Tumen railway dispatching offices actually hinder the normal exchange of industrial and agricultural products, which is naturally wrong.

    运行正点是为了什么
    吉林铁路管理局吉林、图们调度所有些调度员，为了保持列车运行正点，创造本班的“成绩”，对沿线各车站的零担货物常常不给装运。吉林调度所调度员王润洲在1955年12月7日给烟筒山站一辆棚车装运土产公司的活猪，早上五点多钟通知土产公司赶快赶猪来装车，货主从五里路外把活猪赶来了，结果调度所给的车皮不能装运活猪，调度员王润洲又叫货主第二天再装车。货主没办法，只好把活猪赶回猪场，因为来的时候赶得太急，回到养猪场就死了两头大肥猪。另外，图们调度所在1955年10月份，也是为了保证列车运行正点，就有22件货物没有到卸货的车站就给卸下不管了。
    保持列车运行正点，是为了减少列车在沿途各车站上不必要的停留，增加列车运转次数，保证工农业产品的正常交流。但是，吉林、图们铁路调度所的这种做法，反而阻碍了工农业产品的正常交流，自然是错误的。
