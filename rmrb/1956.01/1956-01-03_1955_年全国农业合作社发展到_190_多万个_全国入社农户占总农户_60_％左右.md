    In 1955, the number of agricultural cooperatives nationwide reached more than 1.9 million
　　The number of farm households joining the cooperatives accounted for about 60% of the total.
    This newspaper reports that with the vigorous development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, great changes took place in rural areas nationwide in the second half of 1955. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of 1955, there were already more than 1.9 million agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, an increase of nearly twofold compared to the 650,000 before the autumn harvest; the number of farm households joining the cooperatives had reached more than 70 million, accounting for about 60% of the total number of farm households. This was a year of decisive victory in China's socialist transformation of agriculture. It is estimated that by the spring plowing of 1956, most rural areas across the country will have basically realized semi-socialist cooperativization.
    This agricultural cooperativization movement has developed rapidly, whether in old or new areas, plains or mountains, or minority ethnic regions. For example, in Fujian, Gansu, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and other places, more than half of the farmers have joined the cooperatives. Some of the so-called backward villages in the past have also established agricultural production cooperatives.
    The development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in various places is also healthy. After most agricultural production cooperatives were formed, they immediately established production order and transitioned to production. The need for means of production has greatly increased. Of the 400,000 double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows planned for promotion nationwide in 1955, only more than 80,000 were promoted in the first half of the year. After the agricultural cooperativization movement was launched, the plan was soon exceeded, and now many agricultural production cooperatives still need to buy double-furrow plows. In terms of winter plowing and winter planting, according to statistics from Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and other places, the winter plowing area has greatly exceeded the past. The winter planting plans in the southern provinces have also been expanded compared to the past, with Guangxi's winter planting area reaching more than 7 million mu, an increase of 100% compared to last year.
    After Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" was published, it corrected the right-leaning conservative thinking of cadres in various places in leading the agricultural cooperativization movement. Various places made comprehensive plans for agricultural cooperativization work, classified farmers according to class and level of awareness, and transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside to work full-time on establishing cooperatives. At the same time, they also trained a large number of key personnel for establishing cooperatives, enabling the cooperativization movement to develop in a prepared and planned manner. This is the main reason why the cooperativization movement has developed rapidly and healthily. Another reason is the demonstration effect of establishing agricultural production cooperatives over the years, especially in recent years. Of the 650,000 old cooperatives in 1955, more than 80% achieved increased production, and some poor mountain villages also changed their appearance due to the establishment of cooperatives, which was a great attraction for farmers.
    Currently, the work of developing cooperatives in many places has come to an end and rectification has begun. Some places have already begun or are preparing to pilot higher-level cooperatives.

    1955年全国农业合作社发展到190多万个
　　全国入社农户占总农户60％左右
    本报讯　随着农业合作化运动的蓬勃发展，全国农村在1955年下半年发生了很大的变化。根据不完全的统计，到1955年底，全国已有农业生产合作社190多万个，比秋收以前的65万个增加了将近二倍；入社农户已经达到七千多万户，占总农户60％左右。这是我国农业社会主义改造事业取得决定性胜利的一年。预计到1956年春耕以前，全国农村大部地区将基本上实现半社会主义的合作化。
    这次农业合作化运动，不管是老区或新区、平原或山地、或是少数民族地区，都发展很快。例如福建、甘肃、青海、内蒙古等地都已有半数以上农民入社。有些过去的所谓落后乡，现在也都建立了农业生产合作社。
    各地农业合作化运动的发展也是健康的，大部分农业生产合作社组成后，立即建立生产秩序，转入生产。对于生产资料的需要更大大增加，1955年全国计划推广的40万部双轮双（单）铧犁，上半年只推广了八万多部，农业合作化运动开展后，不久就超过了计划，现在还有很多农业生产合作社需要买双铧犁。冬耕冬种方面，据河北、山西、山东等地统计，冬耕面积都超过过去很多。南方各省冬种计划也都比过去扩大，广西冬种面积已有七百多万亩，比去年增加了一倍。
    毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告发表以后，纠正了各地干部领导农业合作化运动的右倾保守思想，各地对农业合作化工作做了全面的规划，根据阶级和觉悟程度把农民排了队，并抽调大批干部下乡专职办社，同时还训练了大批的建社骨干，使合作化运动有准备有计划地发展。这是合作化运动发展迅速而又健康的主要原因。另一个原因是多少年来特别是最近几年创办农业生产合作社所起的示范作用。1955年原有65万个老社，80％以上都获得增产，有些穷山沟也因办了合作社而改变了面貌，这对农民是一个很大的吸引力。
    目前，很多地方发展社的工作已告一段落，开始进行整顿。有些地方已经开始或准备试办高级社。
