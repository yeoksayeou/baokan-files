Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 1st: Soong Ching Ling, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People' Republic of China, delivered a broadcast speech to the Indian people at 7:00 PM on January 1st at the All India Radio Station in Delhi.

Soong Ching Ling said: I have read records of India's glory and greatness, but I have finally seen them with my own eyes. Your country has a vast and rich territory, many ethnic groups, and is one of the world's major countries. Although my visit to your country has been short, I have come to know much about your ancient culture, your modern civilization, and your achievements in national revival. I am deeply impressed by the genius, courage, diligence, and wisdom of your people.

After talking about her impressions of India's social welfare work and India's Second Five-Year Plan, Soong Ching Ling said that India and China are the two most populous countries in the world, and we cannot shirk our responsibility to maintain world peace. As we take a firm stand on current major issues, we will jointly make significant contributions to easing international tensions and peacefully building our respective national economies. It must be recognized that the progress of mankind is indivisible. The world cannot maintain a situation in which some countries are dominated by others for long; peace must be built on the basis of independence, equality, and freedom, and every country must have the opportunity to develop and make progress for the benefit of all mankind. Peace is essential not only for our two countries but also for the whole world, as demonstrated by the Bandung Conference, to which both India and China made great contributions.

Soong Ching Ling concluded: During my 17-day visit to your great country, I have been warmly received. For this, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to your government, Prime Minister Nehru, and all my Indian friends. I feel that my visit to India has made me more clearly understand and cherish the friendly relations between China and India, and more deeply recognize its global significance. Before I leave, let me quote a line from a Chinese poem by an eighth-century poet:

"A bosom friend afar brings a distant land near."

Now please allow me to sincerely wish you a Happy New Year!

　　宋庆龄向印度人民广播演说
    据新华社新德里1日电　中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄于1月1日下午7时在德里全印广播电台向印度人民发表了广播演说。
    宋庆龄说：我曾经读过关于印度的光荣和伟大这一方面的记载，但是我终于亲眼看到了它们。你们的国家有广大而富饶的国土，有许多种民族，而且是世界大国之一。虽然我在你们国家访问的时间很短，但是我已经认识了许多你们古代的文化、你们现代的文明以及你们在国家复兴工作上的成就。你们人民的天才、勇敢、勤劳和智慧，使我得到很深的印象。
    宋庆龄在谈到了她对印度的社会福利工作、和印度的第二个五年计划的印象以后说，印度和中国是世界两个人口最多的国家，我们不能推卸我们维持世界和平的责任。在我们就目前的重大问题采取坚定的立场的时候，我们将共同地对缓和国际紧张局势以及和平建设我们各自的国民经济作出重大的贡献。必须承认，人类的进步是不可分的。世界不能长此保持一些国家受到另一些国家的支配的情况；和平必须建立在独立、平等和自由的基础上，每一个国家必须享有机会获得发展和作出进步，以有利于全人类。不但对我们两国，而且对全世界，和平都是必需的，就像印中两国都有很大贡献的万隆会议所显示的那样。
    宋庆龄最后说：在我访问你们伟大国家的17天期间，我受到了热情的款待。对于这一点，我愿向你们的政府、尼赫鲁总理和我的所有印度朋友们表示我最衷心的感谢。我觉得我对印度的访问已经使我更清楚地了解和珍视中印两国间的友好关系，更深刻地认识到它的世界性意义。在我离别之前，让我援引第八世纪一位中国诗人的一行诗：
    “海内存知己，天涯若比邻。”
    现在请允许我衷心祝贺你们新年快乐！
