　　Romanian Folk Art
　　By Bono Ghano, Director of the Museum of Folk Art of the Romanian People's Republic, Professor of the Bucharest Academy of Fine Arts
    If you have the opportunity to visit the villages of the Romanian People's Republic, you will be attracted by the diverse forms of architectural art and will often be involuntarily drawn to admire the picturesque villages: here a carved wooden door, a porch pillar, there a spinning wheel for women to spin thread, and a little further away wooden buckets for girls to fetch water from the well. During festivals, the main roads and cultural centers of the villages are filled with jubilation, and people are dazzled by the various artistic decorations and the colorful costumes worn by young people, women, the elderly, and children. If you go inside the houses, you will discover even more of the people's artistic talents. Everything in the interior, such as furniture, pottery, carpets, tapestries, cushions, towels, etc., demonstrates the people's love of art and their need for beauty.
    The techniques, raw materials, varieties, and forms used by the people in different regions to manufacture daily necessities are diverse. Take clothing as an example: not only are there different types such as summer clothing, winter clothing, wedding dresses, burial clothes, work clothes, and festive costumes, but people of different ages, genders, occupations, and social classes also have different attire. The richness and variety of people's lives can also be seen in all other utensils of artistic value.
    Whether they are items manufactured by people to meet their daily needs or by craftsmen to supply the countryside, they all display the characteristics of folk art in various regions. Although the territory of the Romanian People's Republic is not large, it has formed dozens of regions with different characteristics, and almost every village in these regions has its own artistic style, or it can be said that they all have their own masterpieces. This regional characteristic is partly due to the isolation caused by feudal separatism, and partly due to differences in geographical environment, raw materials, and people's lives. However, the styles of folk art in various regions influence each other. Although they have different characteristics, Romanian folk art still has its own obvious and unified style as a whole.
    Now, our people are exploring their own national cultural and artistic treasures. The results of the exploration prove that our folk art has a long history. Based on the original traditions of folk art, the working people have continuously created new art forms, invented new technologies, and absorbed valuable things from other nations to enrich our folk art. In the ninth to eleventh centuries, Romanian folk art flourished and developed greatly. At that time, some farmers who were originally engaged in agricultural production began to specialize in handicraft production, such as weaving, sewing, embroidery, carpet weaving, building houses, making pottery, etc. Until recently, these handicrafts were very developed in our country. Now, our people have created new living conditions and largely use machines to manufacture tools and supplies. However, the people's artistic creative talents are not therefore buried. People use their spare time to make various handicrafts to beautify their living environment.
    Talented craftsmen and designers in cities and villages are led by the "Romanian Folk Art Creation Institute," which is also responsible for organizing professional art groups. In addition, folk art cooperatives have been organized in many villages in various states. Excellent craftsmen continue to develop their artistic talents with the help of artists, and folk art is increasingly becoming an inexhaustible treasure trove of art for artists. In this regard, artists first hand over their creatively designed and artistic daily necessities to art cooperatives for production. The people create art, and art returns to the people in a higher form and with new content.
    Folk art is beautiful because it embodies the people's love and feelings for life. It is impossible to introduce the folk art of a country to the Chinese people, who have a long cultural history of thousands of years and a rich art treasure, all at once. However, the Chinese people are good at sensitively recognizing the art of other nations and deeply understanding its artistic value. Therefore, it can be said with certainty that the great Chinese people will appreciate and love our folk art. The "Folk Art Exhibition of the Romanian People's Republic" being held in the capital of the People's Republic of China is an exhibition that directly introduces our folk art to the Chinese people. May this exhibition help to further strengthen and consolidate the friendship and unity between the Romanian and Chinese people.

　　罗马尼亚的民间艺术
　　罗马尼亚人民共和国民间艺术博物馆馆长  布加勒斯特美术学院教授  波诺加诺
    如果有机会访问一下罗马尼亚人民共和国的村庄，就会被多种多样的建筑艺术形式所吸引，而且往往不由自主地停留下来，欣赏那建筑得美丽如画的村落：这儿是一个有着雕饰的木门、房柱，那儿是妇女捻线用的纺锤，稍远些又放着姑娘们到井边汲水用的木桶。逢到节日，村庄的大路上和文化馆里就欢腾起来，这时人们被各式各样富有艺术性的装饰物和青年、妇女、老人、孩子穿着的五彩缤纷的服装弄得眼花缭乱，应接不暇。如果走进屋子里看看，就更能发现人民的艺术才能。室内的一切陈设，像家具、陶器、地毯、壁毯、垫子、毛巾等等，都能说明人民对艺术的爱好和他们对美的需要。
    各个地区人民制造生活用品的技术、所使用的原料和所制造的品种、形式都是多种多样的。譬如以服装来说，不仅有夏季服装、冬季服装、结婚礼服、殡衣、工作服和节日服装等等的不同种类，而且不同的年龄、性别、职业和社会阶层的人又各有不同的装束。从其他一切有艺术价值的用具上，也都可以看出人民生活的丰富多采。
    无论是人们为满足自己日常生活需要而制造的、或是手工业者为供应乡村而制造的器物，都显示出各地区民间艺术的特色。罗马尼亚人民共和国的土地虽然不大，然而却形成了几十个具有不同特点的地区，而这些地区的每个村落，又几乎都有他们自己的艺术风格，或者可以说，他们都有自己的拿手杰作。这种地区特点，一方面是封建割据时期的闭关自守所造成，另一方面则由于地理环境、原料和人民生活的不同所致。但是，各地区的民间艺术的风格是相互影响的，它们虽各有不同的特色，而就整体来讲，罗马尼亚的民间艺术，仍然有它明显的、统一的风格。
    现在，我国人民正在发掘自己民族的文化艺术宝藏，发掘的结果证明，我们的民间艺术早已有很悠久的历史，劳动人民从民间艺术原有的传统基础上，不断地创造了新的艺术形式，发明了新的技术，并且在和其他民族的接触中吸收了别人有价值的东西来丰富我国的民间艺术。在第九世纪至十一世纪，罗马尼亚民间艺术就曾盛极一时，并且有了很大发展。那时，一部分原先从事农业生产的农民，就已开始专门从事于手工业生产，例如织布、缝衣、刺绣、织地毯、建筑房屋、制造陶器等等，直到不久以前，这种手工艺品，在我国一直是很发达的。现在，我国人民创造了新的生活条件，在很大程度上使用机器来制造工具和用品。但是人民的艺术创造才能并不因此而被湮没。人们利用闲暇时间制造各种手工艺品来美化自己的生活环境。
    城市和乡村中有才能的工艺品制造者、设计者，都受“罗马尼亚民间艺术创造所”领导，创造所还担负组织职业艺术团体的任务。此外，还在各州的很多村庄里组织了民间艺术合作社。优秀的手工业者在艺术家的帮助之下继续发挥他们的艺术才能，而民间艺术也越来越成为艺术家取之不尽、用之不竭的艺术宝库了。在这方面，艺术家们首先把自己创造的、富有艺术性的日用品的设计模型，交给艺术合作社去生产。人民创造了艺术，艺术又以高级的形式和新的内容回到民间。
    民间艺术是美丽的，因为它体现了人民对生活的爱好和感受。要想一下子把一个国家的民间艺术介绍给具有几千年悠久的文化历史和丰富的艺术宝藏的中国人民，那是不可能的。然而，中国人民是善于敏感地认识其他民族的艺术，并深刻地了解它的艺术价值的。因此，肯定地说，伟大的中国人民会欣赏和喜爱我国的民间艺术。正在中华人民共和国首都举行的“罗马尼亚人民共和国民间艺术展览会”，是直接把我国民间艺术向中国人民公开介绍的一个展览会。愿这个展览会有助于罗中两国人民友谊、团结的进一步加强和巩固。
