    To Swell One's Face by Patting it to Look Plump
    As the failure of the "policy of strength" in the United States has been subjected to more and more criticism, Dulles, as the executor of this bankrupt policy, is clearly restless. In order to defend himself, Dulles effortlessly "created" three "victories" for the "policy of strength."
    These three "victories," which the whole world knew for the first time, appeared in the January 11 issue of the American magazine "Life." In a conversation with the magazine's reporter Shepley, Dulles boasted that he had the "necessary art" of being able to bring the world "to the edge of war without getting into war." It is said that he performed this "art" three times, and all achieved "victories." Once was during the Korean armistice, once was during the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, and once was supposedly in the autumn of 1954 when the Chinese people were about to liberate Taiwan. According to Dulles, it was entirely thanks to the United States' threat of atomic war that war was avoided, that the Korean armistice and the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue were achieved, and that the Chinese people did not liberate Taiwan in 1954. From this, of course, it should be concluded that the "policy of strength" is indeed an indispensable treasure.
    However, this time, the "artist" of the "policy of strength" did not perform very well. The whole world is not as forgetful as Dulles hopes. Everyone remembers that the Korean War was a war that the United States fought for three years without any results before being forced to an armistice. Before the Korean armistice negotiations began, Wedemeyer testified: "The Korean War is a bottomless pit, and there is no hope for the United Nations to win." This disheartening remark serves as an excellent annotation to Dulles's boast of the so-called "victory" of the "policy of strength."
    Speaking of the restoration of peace in Indochina, people have not forgotten how Dulles stormed out of the Geneva Conference in anger. Dulles told such a big lie that even the "New York Times" couldn't help but point out that this gentleman was too bold, because "At that time, Mr. Dulles and Under Secretary of State Smith said that the armistice was a very bad deal. In fact, the United States refused to sign the armistice agreement."
    Dulles's boasting that he achieved a "victory" in obstructing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan is simply a dream. The realization of the Korean armistice has already proved that Dulles's set of "art" is useless on the Chinese people. The Chinese people will definitely liberate Taiwan, and Dulles will definitely see it with his own eyes as long as he lives.
    The three "victories" "created" by Dulles in "Life" magazine have aroused mockery from all sides around the world. But Dulles still announced through the State Department spokesman that his talk did not need any "corrections." Dulles's philosophy is clearly: Since you've swollen your face, you can't help but pretend to be fat.

    打肿脸充胖子
    在美国的“实力政策”失败受到了越来越多的指责以后，作为这个破产政策的执行者的杜勒斯显然坐立不安了。为了给自己辩护，杜勒斯就毫不费力地自己给“实力政策”“创造”了三次“胜利”。
    这三次全世界头一回知道的“胜利”，出现在1月11日出版的美国“生活”杂志上。杜勒斯在对这家杂志的记者谢普利的谈话中吹嘘他有所谓使世界“达到战争的边缘而不卷入战争的能力”的“必要的艺术”。据说他这一手“艺术”表演了三次，并且都取得了“胜利”。一次是在朝鲜停战的时候，一次是在印度支那问题和平解决的时候，还有一次是据说在1954年秋天中国人民要解放台湾的时候。据杜勒斯说，全靠着美国用原子战争进行威胁，才避免了战争，才有了朝鲜停战和印度支那问题的和平解决，才使得中国人民不在1954年解放台湾。由此当然应该得出结论，“实力政策”实在是少不得的宝贝。
    但是，这位“实力政策”的“艺术家”这一回表演得实在不高明。全世界都还没有像杜勒斯所希望的那样健忘，谁都还记得朝鲜战争是美国打了三年毫无结果的战争以后才被迫停战的。魏德迈在朝鲜停战谈判开始以前作证说：“朝鲜战争是一个无底洞，看不到联合国有胜利的希望。”这句沮丧话正好给杜勒斯吹嘘的所谓“实力政策”的“胜利”作了一个绝妙的注解。
    说到印度支那和平的恢复，人们都还没有忘记杜勒斯当年怎样气鼓鼓地逃离日内瓦会议。杜勒斯这个谎撒得这样大，甚至“纽约时报”也忍不住要指出这位老爷未免太胆大了，因为“当时杜勒斯先生和副国务卿史密斯说这个停战是一笔很坏的交易。事实上美国拒绝在停战协定上签字。”
    杜勒斯吹嘘他取得了阻挠中国人民解放台湾的“胜利”，那简直是在说梦话。朝鲜停战的实现已经证明，杜勒斯那一套“艺术”在中国人民身上是用不上的。中国人民一定要解放台湾，杜勒斯只要活着，就一定可以亲眼看到。
    杜勒斯在“生活”杂志上所“创造”的三个“胜利”，已经在全世界引起了各方面的嘲笑。但是杜勒斯仍然通过国务院的发言人宣布，他这篇谈话不需要作任何“更正”。杜勒斯的哲学显然是：既然打肿了脸，就不能不充胖子。
