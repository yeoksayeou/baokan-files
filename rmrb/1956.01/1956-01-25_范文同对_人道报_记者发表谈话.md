Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 23rd (TASS dispatch) – "l'Humanité" published a statement by Phạm Văn Đồng, Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to a "l'Humanité" reporter stationed in Hanoi.

In the first part of the statement, Phạm Văn Đồng pointed out: "The Ngô Đình Diệm government and its American masters are systematically sabotaging the Geneva Accords, which stipulated the holding of general elections to reunify the country." He further emphasized that the South Vietnamese authorities could not do anything on their own; they had to rely on the support of Pentagon representatives who were preparing to incorporate the southern part of the country into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Phạm Văn Đồng said that the American officers who recently arrived in Saigon blatantly used Dulles's "brink of war" policy, as proposed in "Life" magazine, as their own guide. He emphasized that the Vietnamese people unanimously demanded strict adherence to the Geneva Accords, and their slogan was: Peace, Unity, Independence, and Democracy.

The second part of the statement concerned the relationship between France and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Phạm Văn Đồng pointed out that the 1954 Geneva Conference laid the foundation for a new type of relationship between the two countries. However, the French government not only avoided fulfilling these agreements but even joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military bloc, which was specifically aimed at the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Phạm Văn Đồng said: "We have proposed, and continue to propose: the mutual dispatch of diplomatic representatives, the development of trade, and the mutual dispatch of various delegations, etc., while maintaining France's economic and cultural interests." He emphasized that the relationship between France and Vietnam should be based on reciprocity. He also emphasized that now is the time for some people in France to realize that it is no longer possible to continue implementing the policies they pursued in the colonial era towards the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    范文同对“人道报”记者发表谈话
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社巴黎23日讯：“人道报”刊载越南民主共和国总理范文同向“人道报”驻河内记者发表的谈话。
    范文同在谈话的第一部分中指出：“吴庭艳政府和它的美国主子是在有计划地破坏规定举行大选以便重新统一这个国家的日内瓦协定。”他进一步强调指出，南越当局单凭自己是干不出任何事情的，他们得依靠正在准备使这个国家的南部参加东南亚条约组织的五角大楼代表的支持。
    范文同说，最近到达西贡的美国军官露骨地以杜勒斯在“生活”杂志上提出的接近“战争边缘”的政治方针，来作为他们自己的指南。他强调指出，越南人民一致要求严格遵守日内瓦协定，他们的口号是：和平、团结、独立和民主。
    谈话的第二部分是关于法国和越南民主共和国之间的关系问题。范文同指出，1954年的日内瓦会议为两国建立新型的关系奠定了基础。但是，法国政府不仅避免履行这些协定，甚至参加了矛头特别指向越南民主共和国的东南亚条约军事集团。范文同说：“我们曾经建议，而且继续建议：在维持法国的经济和文化利益的同时互派外交代表，发展贸易以及互派各种代表团等等。”他强调指出，法国和越南之间的关系应该建立在互惠基础上。他还强调指出，现在是法国某些人士认识到再也不可能继续对越南民主共和国执行他们在殖民主义时代所奉行的政策的时候了。
