    Dangerous Coal for Locomotives
    To the Editor:
    The locomotive coal sent to the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau from the Xishan and Fujiatan coal mines, which are under the jurisdiction of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry, often contains dangerous goods such as detonators and explosives. From February 14 to August 2, 1955, we picked out a total of 45 detonators and 9 packages of explosives from the coal. As everyone can imagine, what kind of serious accident would occur if these things were thrown into a locomotive boiler! Every time we picked out dangerous goods, we sent written opinions to the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry and the Xishan and Fujiatan coal mines (a total of 6 times from February 14 to August 2, 1955), but we did not receive any results. The reply from the Xishan Coal Mine on July 20, 1955, even attempted to shirk responsibility. They said: "We have taken preventive measures and stipulated that they will be officially implemented from June 1... The detonators, explosives and other dangerous goods picked out by your bureau were found in the coal transported before our mine officially implemented this regulation." But in fact, there were 7 detonators and one package of explosives in the coal cars sent by this mine from June to August.

    危险的机车用煤编辑同志：
    山西省工业厅所属西山和富家滩煤矿发到郑州铁路管理局的机车用煤里面经常混有雷管和炸药等危险品。从1955年2月14日到8月2日，我们从煤里共拣出雷管45个，炸药9包。大家可以想像得到，这些东西如果投到机车锅炉里，将会发生什么样的严重事故！每次拣出危险品以后，我们都向山西省工业厅和西山、富家滩两个煤矿提出书面意见（从1955年2月14日到8月2日就前后提了6次），但是并没有收到什么效果。西山煤矿1955年7月20日给我们的复信里甚至还企图推卸责任。他们说：“我们已作了防范措施，规定自6月1日正式执行……，你局拣出的雷管和炸药等危险品，是在我矿未正式贯彻执行此项规定以前运往的煤中发现的。”可是事实上，这个矿6月到8月送来的煤车里就有雷管7个，炸药一包。
