    Shanghai Workers Continuously Create New Production Records

    In the days of celebrating the victory of socialist transformation, workers in many state-owned and earlier joint state-private factories in Shanghai are continuously creating new production records.

    On the morning of the 21st, worker representatives from 10 factories, including the State-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, and the Joint State-Private Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory No. 2, excitedly went to the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions to report their successes.

    Hu Senrong, a planer at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, and 17 others have already completed their January workload ahead of schedule. In 20 days, workers throughout the plant submitted more than 330 rationalization proposals. From the 2nd to the 19th, 80% of the work groups in the State-owned Shanghai No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
