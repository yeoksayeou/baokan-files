Xinhua News Agency, via TASS: The Soviet Antarctic Expedition has begun constructing the "Peace" scientific observatory on the Antarctic coast within the Antarctic Circle.

After the "Ob'号 (Ob')" expedition ship arrived in Antarctica, the first group of scientists conducted repeated investigations using aircraft and decided to build the observatory on the bedrock of Haswell Island, which rises above the ice and snow. A reserve air base will also be constructed on the shore of Depôt Bay. Haswell Island is approximately one mile long and wide, with a maximum elevation of 103 meters above sea level.

To begin the work of establishing the observatory ahead of schedule, pilots transported 17 people by plane to the future site of the observatory before the "Ob'" arrived in the new area. This group has already erected two black tents and set up accommodations. Geologists have begun inserting markers into the rocks, architects have planned the residential area, and the foundations for the power station and radio station have been located. A long street is planned for the residential area.

At the same time, the "Ob'" sailed out of Depôt Bay and headed towards a new anchorage along a route never before traveled by ships. The ship navigated windingly between icebergs, rocks, and shoals. At noon on the 15th, it approached the ice edge. The ship broke through a half-meter-thick layer of ice for about half a kilometer and finally stopped less than 100 meters from the shore. Then, intense work began. First, roads were laid, and tractors dragged sleds ashore. Unloading, establishing the observatory, and scientific work were carried out simultaneously.

Further, the Soviet Antarctic Expedition auxiliary ship "Lena" has also approached Antarctica. Scientists on board have also conducted a great deal of scientific work along the way.

Xinhua News Agency: According to a special correspondent with the Soviet Antarctic Scientific Expedition, via TASS: Following the arrival of the "Ob'" diesel-electric ship at the Antarctic continent, the second ship of the Soviet Antarctic Scientific Expedition—the "Lena" diesel-electric ship—also arrived in Antarctica. On the 20th, it met the "Ob'" near the east coast of Antarctica. The "Lena" completed its 20,000-kilometer voyage through European seas, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Indian Ocean near Haswell Island outside the Antarctic Circle.

This snow-covered, desolate Antarctic continent welcomed the second group of personnel of the Soviet Antarctic Scientific Expedition who arrived on the "Lena" with a clear and brilliant morning.

    苏联南极考察队着手建筑观测站
    新华社据塔斯社报道　苏联南极考察队已经着手在南极圈的南极海岸上建筑“和平”科学观测站。
    “鄂毕号”考察船到达南极后，第一批科学工作者利用飞机进行了反复调查，决定把观测站建筑在哈斯威尔岛露出冰雪之上的基岩上，并且在德波特湾岸上建设一个后备的飞机基地。哈斯威尔岛长宽各约一英里，最高处拔海103公尺。
    为了提前开始建立观测站的工作，飞行员在“鄂毕号”到达新地区之前就用飞机运了17个人到观测站未来的站址。这一批人已经架起两个黑帐篷，安置了住所。地质学家开始在岩石上插上标志，建筑师规划了居住区，电力站和无线电台的地基也找好了，预计在居住区要建设一条长街道。
    和这同时，“鄂毕号”驶出德波湾，沿着从来没有船只到过的路线开向新的停泊处。船在冰山、岩石、浅滩之间曲曲折折地行驶。15日中午靠近了冰缘，船在半公尺厚的冰层上打通了一条约半公里长的进路，终于在离岸不到100公尺的地方停下来。于是，紧张的工作开始了。首先铺起了道路，拖拉机拖着雪撬上岸了。卸货工作、建立观测站的工作和科学工作同时展开了。
    又讯　苏联南极考察队辅助船“勒拿号”也已接近南极。船上的科学家在沿路也进行了许多科学工作。
    新华社讯　据塔斯社随苏联南极科学考察队特派记者报道：继“鄂毕号”柴油电动轮船到达南极大陆之后，苏联南极科学考察队的第二艘船——“勒拿号”柴油电动船也到达了南极，20日它在南极东海岸附近同“鄂毕号”相会。“勒拿号”在南极圈以外哈斯威尔岛附近结束了它经过欧洲各海、大西洋和印度洋的两万公里的航程。
    这个遍地冰雪、杳无人烟的南极，以一个晴朗灿烂的早晨欢迎了随“勒拿号”来到的苏联南极科学考察队的第二批人员。
