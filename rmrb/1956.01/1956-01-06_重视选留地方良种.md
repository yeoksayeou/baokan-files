Emphasize Selecting and Retaining Local Good Seed Varieties

In 1955, Jilin Province conducted seed evaluation work in 760 villages. Shuangliao, Hunchun, Nong'an, Linjiang and other counties, through seed evaluation, promoted cooperatives to select and exchange more than 3.8 million jin of local fine seeds, basically solving the problems of seed mixing and seed shortage.

How was the seed evaluation work carried out in the villages? The practice of Ertongshan Village (Township) in the Eighth District of Shuangliao County was to form a seed selection committee under the leadership of the Party branch and the People's Committee. The committee convened management committee members from various agricultural cooperatives, mutual aid team leaders, technical personnel, youth representatives, women's representatives, etc. to hold discussions. They brought physical samples to the meeting, first the cultivator introduced the source of the variety, cultivation methods, variety characteristics, yield and quality, and then everyone evaluated. After evaluation, good varieties of corn, millet, and sorghum that could be promoted were selected. According to the village's 1956 planting plan, the committee designated five cooperatives to form a seed selection team for joint seed selection. More than 31,000 jin of high-quality seeds have now been selected. The committee also mobilized farmers who planned to join the cooperative to select and retain seeds. In this way, when establishing and expanding cooperatives, the phenomenon of temporarily collecting seeds and causing seed mixing can be avoided.

    重视选留地方良种
    吉林省1955年有760个村进行了种子评比工作。双辽、珲春、农安、临江等县，经过种子评比，推动合作社选出和串换了380多万斤地方优良种子，基本上解决了种子混杂和缺种的问题。
    各村的种子评比工作是怎样进行的？双辽县八区二童山村（乡）的做法是在党支部和人民委员会的领导下组成选种委员会。由委员会召集各农业合作社管理委员、互助组组长、技术手、青年代表、妇女代表等举行座谈。他们把实物标本拿到会上，先由栽培人介绍品种来源、栽培方法、品种特性、产量和品质情况，再由大家评比。经过评比，选出了可以推广的玉米、谷子、高粱的良种。委员会根据1956年全村播种计划，指定五个合作社组成选种小组进行联合选种。现在已经选出优良种子31，000多斤。委员会还动员打算入社的农户，选留种子。这样，到建社和扩社的时候就可以避免临时凑集种子，造成种子混杂的现象。
