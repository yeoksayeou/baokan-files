    Accelerate the Construction of Local Transportation and Rural Postal and Telecommunications
    Wang Shoudao, Director of the Sixth Office of the State Council
    I
    The transportation and postal and telecommunications departments are integral parts of the national economy. With the great development of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production, the demand for agricultural production materials and consumer goods in rural areas will greatly increase, and the supply of commercial grain and industrial raw materials from rural areas to cities and industrial production will also greatly increase. The communication between rural and urban areas, especially the need for newspapers and periodicals in rural areas, will also greatly increase. Therefore, huge new demands have been placed on the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments: to provide convenient transportation and communication conditions, and to provide large, high-quality, low-cost, and fast transportation capacity.
    At present, the work of local transportation and rural postal and telecommunications has fallen far behind the new situation of agricultural cooperation. In terms of local transportation: 26% of counties nationwide still do not have access to highways, and many provinces and regions lack county and township roads; small and medium-sized waterways lack improvement, and bridges and ferries are in disrepair; highway and inland river transportation have not opened up more operating routes to penetrate the vast rural areas and mountainous areas. The socialist transformation of capitalist transportation and individual transportation industries is stagnant, and there is a lack of overall planning for various transportation tools and full utilization of their transportation roles. Inconvenient transportation in vast rural areas, especially border and mountainous areas, is still in a state of traffic congestion, which seriously affects the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and the transportation and promotion of new agricultural machinery. In terms of rural postal and telecommunications: 17% of districts and 81% of townships nationwide still do not have telephone access. The existing machine and line equipment is of low quality, lacks regular maintenance and a management system, and the call quality is poor. There are few rural postal service agencies, and 22% of townships still do not have postal access. The delivery of various mails below the township level mostly relies on the forwarding of the masses, and delays and losses occur from time to time. Many newspapers and periodicals needed in rural areas cannot be subscribed to or delivered, and the policies and laws of the Party and the government, as well as the instructions of higher-level Party and government organs, cannot be delivered in a timely manner.
    If the backwardness of local transportation and rural postal and telecommunications work is not rapidly improved, it will not only fail to support and promote the great development of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production, but will also hinder the great development of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production. The basic tasks facing local transportation and rural postal and telecommunications work are:
    In terms of local transportation: to build a large number of county and township roads, with a focus on provincial trunk lines. Within 7 years, the national highway mileage should reach more than 600,000 kilometers, and a local road network should be basically built. The quality and grade of roads should be gradually improved through maintenance. Improve and open up small and medium-sized rivers with transportation value, build simple port terminals, and actively improve navigation conditions. Within 7 years, the total mileage of inland river steamships in the country should reach more than 100,000 kilometers. Widely develop the transportation combining shallow-water tugboats and wooden sailboats, steadily develop automobile and trailer transportation, rationally utilize existing various folk transportation tools, strengthen regional planned transportation, and complete the socialist transformation of the transportation industry as soon as possible.
    In terms of rural postal and telecommunications: gradually increase rural post and telecommunications offices and rural postmen, universally implement the "agricultural cooperative postman" system, basically build a rural postal network, basically achieve the goal of setting up offices in market towns, having postal routes in every township, having newspapers and periodicals in every cooperative, having postmen in every cooperative, and having various mails delivered to households through cooperative postmen; actively erect and rectify county telephone lines, set up and use radio communications in counties and districts with vast areas, sparse populations, and inconvenient transportation, basically build township and large agricultural cooperative telephone networks and wired broadcasting networks, and basically achieve the goal of telephone access in every township and broadcasting in every cooperative.
    II
    In order to ensure the completion of the task of developing local transportation and rural postal and telecommunications construction, it is necessary to resolutely overcome right-leaning conservative ideas in the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments.
    Right-leaning conservative thinking in local transportation and rural postal and telecommunications work is first manifested in the lack of understanding of the needs and urgency of local transportation and rural postal and telecommunications construction, and the long-term neglect of leadership over transportation work in vast rural areas. In local transportation work, only attention is paid to the construction of highway trunk lines and trunk line transportation, while neglecting the repair of county and township roads, inland river tributaries, and the transportation needs of vast rural areas; some cadres in the postal and telecommunications departments believe that county telephones are not an urgent matter and can be erected slowly, neglecting the urgent need for Party and government organs to guide rural work.
    Secondly, there is insufficient understanding of the strength and enthusiasm of local organizations and the broad masses, as well as various favorable factors in the work. Difficulties are overemphasized, and the promotion of positive factors and the exploitation of potential forces are neglected.
    Third, there is hesitation and endless worries about the cooperation of the individual transportation industry, which has remained in the pilot stage for a long time. The future development of the individual transportation industry is always being debated, which greatly affects the enthusiasm of the broad working masses to take the socialist road. The socialist transformation of the capitalist transportation industry has not been grasped tightly and the progress is slow; cooperative enterprises have not been further improved on the basis of existing work and are stagnant.
    Fourth, the capitalist business thinking in transportation is still very serious, and there are still unreasonable transportation plans and high transportation costs. In addition, some areas do not operate transportation facing the vast rural areas, remote areas, and branch lines, but squeeze on a few trunk lines to compete for cargo sources, resulting in a serious situation of insufficient cargo sources on trunk lines and the accumulation of materials in vast rural and remote areas.
    Fifth, some cadres are satisfied with the existing work achievements, complacent and arrogant, satisfied with the status quo, unable to see the shortcomings and problems in the work, and unable to see the direction of progress. Some cadres often disregard needs and possibilities, disregard specific conditions, and formulate and issue a large number of lengthy instructions, orders, regulations, and systems, forming "strict rules and precepts" that restrain the enthusiasm of the broad masses.
    The main reasons for the emergence of right-leaning conservative thinking are: on the one hand, our central competent departments have relaxed their leadership and failed to place local transportation and rural postal and telecommunications work in an important position for overall consideration and comprehensive planning. Effective measures have not been taken to earnestly implement the established work guidelines and tasks, and there is a lack of specific assistance and supervision. Advanced experiences in the work of various regions have not been promptly summarized and vigorously promoted. There is a lack of in-depth investigation and research on the situation and problems in actual work, limited to general understanding, and the solution of problems is not deep or thorough. The competent departments of various provinces have also failed to give play to their due initiative and enthusiasm and fulfill their due responsibilities. On the other hand, the main reason is that we have insufficient understanding of the unique scale and speed of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country, lack a keen sense of the increasingly high tide of our national economy, and lack a deep analysis of the objective law that transportation volume will inevitably increase accordingly with the continuous improvement of industrial and agricultural production; some cadres do not consider economic issues from a political perspective, get bogged down in daily economic affairs, do not pay attention to implementing the Party's policies, and cannot see new situations and new changes, with a tendency to neglect politics, so that they have failed to better integrate with the Party's general line, actively plan and arrange their own work, and thus appear to lack vigor and drive in their work, and lack a high degree of ideological, political, and foresight. These shortcomings must be overcome in the future.
    III
    To develop local transportation and rural postal and telecommunications work, it is necessary to correctly implement the construction policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical," strengthen overall planning, rely on and promote the socialist construction enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and carry out the work in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    In local transportation and rural postal and telecommunications construction, it is necessary to implement the policy of practicality, economy, and appropriately taking into account future development, and implement the principles of relying on civilian power, using local materials, and adapting to local conditions. It is necessary to adopt various measures that are suitable for current needs, and also take into account the requirements of future development prospects. It is necessary to mobilize and organize civilian workers for construction, and also pay attention to cherishing and saving civilian power. Resolutely overcome the practice of forcing uniformity regardless of the specific conditions of various regions, and resolutely overcome the bias of deviating from the current needs of agricultural production and the needs of the masses. A step of seeking popularity first and then gradually improving should be adopted. In order to adapt to the current needs of agricultural cooperation and the great development of agricultural production, the construction speed in the next two years must be accelerated.
    Local transportation construction must be combined with the development of national transportation trunk lines. It is the development direction of my country's transportation industry to combine various different modes of transportation such as railways, waterways, highways, and aviation in a planned manner to form a unified national transportation network. When building provincial trunk lines, economic surveys and surveying work should be done well, and comparative plans for the lines should be made. According to the needs of political, economic, and cultural development along the line and hydrological and geological data, the most economical and reasonable line should be selected, and different standards should be adopted according to the development of different regions and transportation volumes. The existing county and township roads should be re-planned and rebuilt according to the actual needs of the local area, under the principles of rational utilization of the original roadbed, saving cultivated land, and facilitating transportation. When improving and opening up inland river waterways, comprehensive research and planning should be carried out in combination with the needs and possibilities of comprehensive utilization of water resources such as irrigation, flood control, and power generation. The most economical and reasonable line should be selected according to transportation needs. In cases where both highways and shipping can be developed, inland river shipping should be developed as soon as possible to save national investment.
    Rural postal and telecommunications construction must be combined with the development of national postal and telecommunications trunk lines. The rational distribution of rural postal and telecommunications agencies and postal and telecommunications lines must be planned as a whole, striving for practicality, economy, and convenient communication, and the rural postal and telecommunications communication network should be closely integrated with the national postal and telecommunications communication network as a whole. The organizational principle of the county telephone network basically adopts a tandem and radial style. The erection of county telephones should be combined with the district and township administrative divisions and local transportation and geographical conditions, according to the organizational principle of the network, and the shortest pole lines and the installation location of the exchange that meet the standards of call transmission should be selected. The existing county telephone line settings should be re-planned and rebuilt through renovation under the above-mentioned principles and the conditions of fully utilizing the existing network. Rural postal services should fully estimate the ever-increasing needs of the masses, gradually expand the service area, increase rural postal routes, and increase the frequency of postal transportation. In order to improve the timeliness of mail delivery, expand the distribution of newspapers and periodicals, and facilitate the management of rural postal staff, postal and telecommunications departments should gradually increase the number of rural postal self-operated offices. The frequency of postal transportation should generally be based on the timely arrival of farmers' newspapers and periodicals.
    In order to adapt to the needs of the development of local transportation and rural postal and telecommunications construction, it is necessary to train a large number of technical cadres and actively unite, educate, transform, and improve existing technical cadres. Various regions should formulate plans for training junior technical cadres in accordance with the development plans of the undertaking.
    If you want to quickly complete the above tasks, you must conduct comprehensive planning. When formulating a comprehensive plan, you must start from a long-term perspective, starting from the current needs and possibilities, distinguishing between importance and urgency, and fully developing the enthusiasm and creativity of localities and the masses. Calculate capabilities based on the possibility of tapping potential, promote positive factors, and overcome negative factors; not only should a province have a comprehensive plan for the entire province, but a county, district, and township (village) should also have a comprehensive plan for the entire county, entire district, and entire township (village). This plan must be based on the regional national economic development plan, especially the comprehensive plan for agricultural cooperation as the main basis, and must be able to reflect the actual needs of all aspects. A comprehensive analysis should be made of the comprehensive planning of the province's, county's, district's, and township's (village's) production plans and agricultural cooperation, and a comprehensive economic survey should be conducted. A general survey should be conducted on the basic situation of local transportation and rural postal and telecommunications work; when formulating a comprehensive plan, various effective and specific measures to realize the plan must be formulated, as well as specific implementation plans for each stage and each year; when formulating a comprehensive plan for local transportation construction, a plan for arranging the transformation of various non-socialist economic components of the transportation industry should be formulated so that they can be combined with each other to form a unified comprehensive plan for the development of local transportation.
    IV
    What are the basic measures for developing local transportation and rural postal and telecommunications work?
    (1) Strengthen the planning of local transportation and promote regional rational transportation. The gradual strengthening of the planning of industrial and agricultural production provides favorable conditions for promoting local planned transportation and rational transportation. Local transportation departments should strengthen transportation planning work, formulate methods for formulating, compiling, and executing transportation plans, strengthen economic surveys, grasp the changes in cargo sources and cargo flows, and gradually improve the quality of planning; coordinate and rationally use various transportation tools, and make reasonable divisions of labor and arrangements in terms of operating routes, cargo source allocation, and transportation prices according to their characteristics and distribution, so as to achieve division of labor and cooperation, and mutual connection; promote the regional system of balanced production and sales of major materials and the unified delivery system, and start with the balanced transportation of several major materials according to the economic characteristics of the region, and then expand to other materials.
    (2) Give full play to the enthusiasm of local and mass organizations, organize civilian workers for construction, and use self-raised funds and local fiscal surpluses to carry out local transportation construction. The party and government leaders of Huanren County in Liaoning Province and Ji County in Hebei Province personally led the way, and by formulating plans, they promoted the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in road construction, and closely combined with production and various central tasks to organize the masses to repair roads on a voluntary basis, and adopted the method of gradually repairing highways in stages and sections, which is the best example of building local roads and should be followed in all regions. In order to unify the specifications of local road construction, the Ministry of Transport should quickly issue simplified road standards, and should design and promote applicable and economical standard drawings of small bridges and culverts to solve the design problems of counties and townships. Various regions should pay attention to strengthening technical guidance when mobilizing civilian workers to build roads, so as to improve the quality of work and reduce the waste of manpower. Vigorously promote the experience of using sand and gravel and various local materials to improve soil road surfaces. Various regions should gradually plant trees that are easy to survive, reproduce quickly, and have economic value along all roadsides and river banks according to climate and soil conditions, combined with the work of building water conservancy projects. Greening work should rely on the local masses and be combined with the interests of the masses, and adopt the method of contracting planting and maintenance by agricultural production cooperatives along the line, and the income will be owned by the cooperatives.
    (3) Automobile transportation should use coal, charcoal, firewood, natural gas, etc. as fuel as much as possible to overcome the difficulty of insufficient liquid fuel in our country. Automobiles that burn gasoline should promote the advanced experience of strengthening vehicle maintenance, mastering economic speed, taking slow-speed gliding, improving operating techniques, and installing air fuel-saving devices to save gasoline consumption. At the same time, trailer transportation should also be vigorously promoted.
    Technical improvements should be made to animal-drawn vehicles and manpower vehicles, and the use of rubber tires, hard rubber tires, and ball bearings should be promoted. The structure of the body should be improved according to the types of goods that are often transported to increase transportation efficiency. Relevant departments should manage and study the improvement and production of various backward transportation tools.
    (4) The development of shallow-water tug barge transportation is the development direction of local inland river transportation in the future. The method of combining tugs and wooden sailing boats should be actively promoted, and existing wooden sailing boats should be rationally utilized. If shallow-water tugs can be widely used in my country's inland rivers, nearly half of the existing 3 million tons of wooden sailboats can be towed, and the efficiency can be increased by one to two times. This will not only greatly increase the effectiveness of wooden sailboats, but also extend the mileage of steamships on my country's inland rivers by more than double the current mileage. Therefore, a large number of inland shallow-water tugs should be built to meet the needs of shallow-water tributaries and the transportation of wooden sailboats.
    (5) The speed of the socialist transformation of the capitalist transportation industry and the individual transportation industry should generally be adapted to the speed of the socialist transformation of the capitalist industry and commerce and agriculture. Within 1956, private steamship transportation should be operated jointly by the entire industry on the basis of fixed interest rates by water system, and private automobile transportation should be operated jointly by the entire industry on a provincial (municipal) basis. For the individual transportation industry, except for some that are transferred to agricultural and fishery cooperatives, the rest should complete semi-socialist cooperation in 1956 or 1957, and pilot advanced cooperatives. In addition, the transportation departments of various cities should strengthen the organization and management of loading and unloading workers in urban areas so that they can better serve urban transportation.
    (6) The construction of county telephones should adopt the methods of using local materials (telephone poles), unified planning (iron wires, exchanges, etc.), mobilizing civilian power (construction), and building in stages and batches. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications should quickly formulate simplified, easy-to-understand, and practical line erection regulations and equipment standards, which should not only maintain a certain call quality, but also take into account the actual needs and possible conditions of various regions, and also adjust the current unreasonable charging standards and simplify procedures.
    Wired broadcasting and county telephones should use the same pole and the same line, but strict timed opening systems and necessary technical measures must be formulated to ensure coordination and safety.
    (7) Universally implementing the "agricultural production cooperative postman" system is an effective method to solve the problem of the delivery of rural mail and newspapers. Agricultural production cooperative postmen should be selected from among those who are loyal, reliable, and enthusiastic in handling affairs, and the postal work hours should be recorded by the cooperative as work points. Various regions should promptly summarize and promote experience in this area.
    (8) Develop civil aviation and apply professional aviation to agricultural production. With the great development of agricultural production, agricultural aviation will play a major role in eliminating diseases and insect pests and increasing yield per unit area. When conducting comprehensive planning, various provinces should consider the use and arrangement of professional aviation, consult with relevant departments to include it in the plan, and strengthen leadership and support for the civil aviation industry.
    V
    Strengthening the leadership of the central and provincial and municipal governments over local transportation and postal and telecommunications departments is the main link in accelerating local transportation and rural postal and telecommunications construction. Local transportation and postal and telecommunications departments should often take the initiative to report the situation and work to the local party and government organs, and request leadership and instructions; at the same time, they should ask the party and government leading organs in various places to further strengthen political and ideological leadership and supervision and inspection of the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments, enrich the transportation agencies and cadres of people's committees at all levels, and counties that have not yet established transportation sections should quickly establish them universally. It is recommended that transportation committees or transportation commissions be added to the people's committees of townships (villages) to strengthen rural transportation work. Local transportation and postal and telecommunications departments in various places should actively rectify the ranks, strengthen political and ideological work, leading cadres must go deep into the grassroots to promptly understand the problems in the work, especially to grasp the work center of each period, vigorously promote various advanced experiences, solve key problems, overcome the generalized and handicraft-style leadership style, and strive to do a good job in local transportation and postal and telecommunications work.

    加快地方交通和乡村邮电的建设
    国务院第六办公室主任　王首道
    一        
    运输和邮电部门是国民经济的有机组成部分。随着农业合作化和农业生产的大发展，农村对农业生产资料和生活资料的需要将大大增加，农村为城市和工业生产提供的商品粮食和工业原料也将大大增加，农村和城市的通信联系特别是农村对于报刊的需要也将大大增加。因此，就向运输和邮电部门提出了巨大的新的要求：提供便利的交通条件和通信条件，提供量大、质好、价廉、快速的运输能力。
    目前，地方交通和乡村邮电工作，已经远远落在农业合作化新形势的后面。在地方交通方面：全国至今尚有26％的县不通公路，许多省区的县乡道路不足；中小航道缺乏整治，桥梁、渡口失修失养；公路运输和内河运输没有更多地开辟营运线路，深入广大的农村和山区。对资本主义运输业和个体运输业的社会主义改造停滞不前，对各种运输工具缺乏统筹安排和充分发挥其运输作用。广大农村交通不便，特别是边疆、山区仍然处于交通阻塞的状态，严重地影响城乡物资交流和新式农业机械的运送和推广。在乡村邮电方面：全国至今还有17％的区和81％的乡不通电话，已有的机线设备质量低，缺乏经常维护和一套管理制度，通话质量不好。乡村邮政服务机构少，还有22％的乡不通邮，乡以下各种邮件的投递大多依靠群众捎转，延误丢失等现象时而发生，许多农村需要的报刊收订不上来，投送不下去，党和政府的政策法令以及上级党政机关的指示不能及时下达。
    如不迅速改善地方交通和乡村邮电工作的落后状况，不仅不能很好地支援和促进农业合作化和农业生产的大发展，而且会妨碍农业合作化和农业生产的大发展。摆在地方交通和乡村邮电工作方面的基本任务是：
    在地方交通方面：大量修建县乡道路，重点修建省道干线，7年内全国公路应达60万公里以上，基本建成地方道路网，并且通过养护维修逐步提高道路的质量和等级。整治和开辟有运输价值的中小河流，修建简易的港
  口码头，积极改善航行条件，7年内全国内河通航轮船的里程要达到10万公里以上。广泛发展浅水拖轮和木帆船结合的运输，稳步发展汽车和拖车运输，合理利用现有各种民间运输工具，加强地区性的计划运输，及早完成对运输业的社会主义改造。
    在乡村邮电方面：逐步增设乡村邮电局所和乡村邮递员，普遍实行“农业合作社邮递员”制度，基本建成乡村邮政网，基本做到集镇设局所、乡乡通邮路、社社有报刊、社社有邮递员、各种邮件经过合作社邮递员投递到户；积极架设和整顿县内电话，在地广人稀交通不便的县、区设置和使用无线电通信，基本建成乡和大型农业合作社电话网和有线广播网，基本做到乡乡通电话，社社有广播。
    二
    为保证完成发展地方交通和乡村邮电建设的任务，要坚决克服运输和邮电部门中的右倾保守思想。
    右倾保守思想在地方交通和乡村邮电工作中，首先表现在对于地方交通和乡村邮电建设的需要及其迫切性体会不够，长期轻视对广大农村交通运输工作的领导。在地方交通工作中，只注意公路干线建设和干线运输，忽视县乡道路、内河支流的整修以及广大农村运输的需要；邮电部门有些干部以为县内电话不是当务之急，可以慢慢架设，忽视党政机关指导农村工作的迫切需要。
    其次，对于地方组织和广大群众的力量和积极性以及工作中的各种有利因素认识不足，过分强调困难，忽视发扬积极因素和挖掘潜在力量。
    第三、对个体运输业的合作化，裹足不前，无穷忧虑，长期停留在试点阶段，老是在个体运输业的发展前途上兜圈子，大大影响了广大劳动群众要求走社会主义道路的积极性。对资本主义运输业的社会主义改造工作，抓得不紧，进展缓慢；对合营企业，没有在已有的工作基础上进一步加以提高，踏步不前。
    第四、在运输方面的资本主义经营思想还很严重，还有运输计划不合理和运输成本高的现象。加之有些地区没有面向广大农村、偏僻地区、支线支流经营运输，而是挤在几条干线上争夺货源，因而形成干线货源不足，广大农村和偏僻地区物资积压的严重情况。
    第五、有些干部满足于已有的工作成绩，沾沾自喜，骄傲自满，安于现状，看不到工作中的缺点和问题，看不清前进的方向。有些干部往往不顾需要和可能，不顾具体条件，制定和颁发大批冗长的指示、命令、规章、制度，形成了约束广大群众积极性的“清规戒律”。
    产生右倾保守思想的主要原因：一方面是我们中央主管部门放松领导，未能将地方交通和乡村邮电工作摆在重要的位置上，加以通盘考虑和全面规划。对既定的工作方针和任务，未能采取有效措施认真贯彻执行，缺乏具体帮助和检查督促。对各地工作中的先进经验，未能及时地认真总结和大力推广。对实际工作中的情况和问题，缺少深入的调查研究，限于一般化的了解，解决问题不深不透。各省主管部门也未能发挥应有的主动性积极性，尽到应有的责任。另一方面，主要的是由于我们对我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的特有规模、速度认识不足，对我国国民经济日益高涨的新形势缺乏锐敏感觉，对运输量必然随着工农业生产不断提高而相应增长这一客观规律缺少深刻分析；有些干部不从政治上着眼去考虑经济问题，陷入日常经济事务中，不注意贯彻执行党的政策，看不见新情况新变化，有忽视政治的倾向，以致未能更好地结合党的总路线，积极地规划和安排自己的工作，因而在工作中就显得缺乏朝气和劲头，缺乏高度的思想性、政策性和预见性。今后必须努力克服这些缺点。
    三
    发展地方交通和乡村邮电工作，要正确贯彻执行“多、快、好、省”的建设方针，要加强全面规划，依靠和发扬群众的社会主义建设积极性和创造性，有计划有步骤地进行。
    在地方交通和乡村邮电建设中，必须贯彻执行适用、经济和适当照顾将来发展的方针，贯彻执行依靠民力、就地取材和因地制宜的原则。既要采用适合于现实需要的各种措施，又要考虑到将来发展远景的要求。既要发动和组织民工建勤，又要注意爱惜和节约使用民力。坚决克服不考虑各地具体条件而强求千篇一律的作法，坚决克服脱离目前农业生产需要和群众需要的偏向。应该采取先求普及而后逐步提高的步骤。为了适应当前农业合作化和农业生产大发展的需要，必须加快今后两年的建设速度。
    地方交通建设必须同全国交通运输干线的发展相结合。将铁路、水路、公路和航空等各种不同的运输有计划地结合起来，组成一个全国统一的运输网，是我国交通运输事业的发展方向。修建省道干线应该做好线路经济调查和勘测工作，并且做出线路的比较方案，根据沿线政治、经济和文化发展的需要以及水文地质资料，选择最经济最合理的线路，应该分别地区和运输量发展情况采取不同标准。对现有的县乡道路，应该根据当地的实际需要，在合理利用原有路基、节省耕地面积和便利交通的原则下，重新加以规划和改建。整治和开辟内河航道时，要结合灌溉、防洪、发电等综合利用水利资源的需要和可能，作综合研究和规划，按照运输需要选择最经济最合理的线路，在公路和航运均可开发的情况下，应该尽先开发内河航运，以节省国家投资。
    乡村邮电建设必须同全国邮电干线的发展相结合。必须通盘筹划乡村邮电机构、邮电线路的合理分布，力求适用、经济和通信便利，并且使乡村邮电通信网和全国邮电通信网密切结合成为一个整体。县内电话网路的组织原则，基本上采用汇接辐射式。县内电话的架设，应该根据网路的组织原则，结合区乡行政区划和当地交通地理条件，选择最短的和适合通话传输标准要求的杆路及交换机装设地点。对现有的县内电话机线设置，应该根据上述原则和充分利用已经有网路的条件下，重新加以规划并且通过整修加以改建。乡村邮政应该充分估计日益增长的群众需要，逐步扩大服务面，增加乡邮路线和加密邮运班次。为了提高邮件投递时效，扩大报刊发行，便于管理乡邮人员，邮电部门应逐步增设乡村邮电自办局所。邮运班次一般应以农民报刊适时到达为标准。
    为适应地方交通和乡村邮电建设发展的需要，必须大量培养技术干部，并且积极地团结、教育、改造和提高现有的技术干部。各地应该根据事业发展的计划，相适应地制定培养训练初级技术干部的计划。
    想迅速完成上述任务，就要进行全面规划。在制定全面规划的时候，必须从长远着眼，从现实需要和可能入手，分别轻重缓急，充分发扬地方和群众的积极性创造性，根据挖掘潜力的可能来计算能力，发扬积极因素，克服消极因素；不仅一个省要有全省的全面规划，一个县、区、乡（村）都要有全县的、全区的、全乡（村）的全面规划。这个规划必须以地区性的国民经济发展计划、特别是应该以农业合作化的全面规划作为主要依据，并且能反映出各方面的实际需要，要对全省、全县、全区、全乡（村）的生产计划和农业合作化的全面规划进行综合分析，并作好综合经济调查，对地方交通和乡村邮电工作的基本情况进行普查；制定全面规划，必须制定实现规划的各种有效的具体措施，和分期分年的具体实施方案；在制定地方交通建设的全面规划的时候，要制定安排改造各种非社会主义经济成份运输业的规划，使之相互结合起来组成统一的发展地方交通的全面规划。
    四
    发展地方交通和乡村邮电工作的基本措施是什么呢？
    （一）加强地方运输计划性，推行地区性合理运输。工农业生产计划性的逐步加强，提供了推行地方计划运输和合理运输的有利条件。地方运输部门要加强运输计划工作，制定编制和执行运输计划的办法，并且加强经济调查，掌握货源及货流变化情况，逐步提高计划质量；统筹安排和合理使用各种运输工具，根据其特点和分布情况，在营运线路、货源分配、运输价格等方面作合理的分工和安排，做到分工协作，互相衔接；推广地区性的主要物资分区产销平衡合理运输制度和统一送货制度，根据本地区经济特点，从几项主要物资的平衡运输入手，而后扩及其他。
    （二）充分发挥地方和群众的积极性，组织民工建勤，利用自筹经费和地方财政节余，进行地方交通建设。辽宁省桓仁县和河北省蓟县的党政负责人亲自领导，通过制定计划，发扬了群众建设道路的积极性创造性，密切结合生产和各项中心工作，组织群众义务修路，采取分期分段逐步整修公路的办法，是修建地方道路的最好的榜样，各地都应该仿行。为统一地方道路建设的规格，交通部应该迅速颁发简易道路标准，应该设计和推广适用、经济的小桥涵标准图样，以解决县乡的设计问题。各地在动员民工建勤修建道路，应该注意加强技术指导，以提高工作质量，减少人力浪费。大力推广采用砂石及当地各种材料来改善土路面的经验。各地应该根据气候、土壤条件，结合兴修水利的工作逐步在所有的道旁、河岸，普遍种植易于成活、繁殖快和有经济价值的树木。绿化工作应该依靠当地群众并和群众利益相结合，采取由沿线农业生产合作社分段包栽、包养、收益归社的办法。
    （三）汽车运输应尽可能采用煤炭、木炭、木柴、天然瓦斯等为燃料，以克服我国液体燃料不足的困难。烧汽油的汽车应推广加强车辆保养、掌握经济速度、采取缓速滑行、提高操作技术以及加装空气节油器等先进经验，以节省汽油的消耗。同时，还应该大力推广拖车运输。
    对兽力车、人力车应进行技术改良，推广采用胶轮、硬胶轮和滚珠轴承，根据常运货物种类改进车身构造，以增加运输效能。有关部门对各种落后运输工具的改良和生产等问题，应该加以管理和研究。
    （四）发展浅水拖驳运输是今后地方内河运输的发展方向，要积极推广拖轮和木帆船结合运输的方法，合理利用现有木帆船。在我国内河如能普遍采用浅水拖轮，现有的300多万吨木帆船中有近半数以上可实行拖带，效率可提高一至二倍，这样不仅可以大大提高木帆船的效力，而且将使我国内河通航轮船的里程比现在延长一倍以上。因此，应该大量建造内河浅水拖轮，以适应浅水支流和拖带木帆船运输的需要。
    （五）资本主义运输业和个体运输业社会主义改造的速度，一般应该和资本主义工商业、农业社会主义改造的速度相适应。1956年内，对私营轮船运输业应该按水系、对私营汽车运输业应以省（市）为单位，采用定值定息办法，完成全行业公私合营。对个体运输业，除部分转入农业、渔业合作社外，其余应在1956年或1957年内完成半社会主义的合作化，并且试办高级合作社。此外，各城市交通部门应对市区内的装卸工人加强组织管理，使之更好地为城市运输服务。
    （六）县内电话的建设，应该采取就地取材（电杆）、统一筹划（铁线、交换机等）、动员民力（施工）、分期分批建设的办法。邮电部应该尽速制定简易通俗、切实可行的线路架设规程和器材标准，既要能保持一定的通话质量，也要照顾各地实际需要和可能条件，还要调整现行不合理的收费标准，并且简化手续。
    有线广播和县内电话应采用同杆同线，但是必须制定严格的定时开放制度以及必要的技术措施，以保证协调和安全。
    （七）普遍实行“农业生产合作社邮递员制度，是解决乡村邮件报刊传递的有效方法。农业生产合作社邮递员应该物色忠实可靠、办事热心的人来担任，邮递工作时间由合作社评记工分。各地应及时总结和推广这方面的经验。
    （八）发展民用航空应用于农业生产的专业航空。随着农业生产的大发展，在消除病虫害和提高单位面积产量的任务中，农业航空将发挥重大作用。各省在进行全面规划的时候，应该考虑对专业航空的使用和安排，商同有关部门纳入计划，并且加强对民航事业的领导和支持。
    五
    加强中央和省市对地方交通和邮电部门的领导，是加快地方交通和乡村邮电建设的主要环节。各地方交通和邮电部门应该经常主动向当地党政机关反映情况、汇报工作，请求领导和指示；同时，要求各地党政领导机关进一步加强对交通和邮电部门的政治思想领导和监督检查，充实各级人民委员会的交通机构和干部，尚未建立交通科的县应该迅速普遍建立，建议在乡（村）人民委员会中增设交通委员或交通委员会以加强乡村交通工作。各地方交通和邮电部门应该积极整顿队伍，加强政治思想工作，领导干部必须深入基层及时了解工作中的问题，特别要抓紧各个时期的工作中心，大力推广各种先进经验，解决关键性问题，克服一般化和手工业式的领导作风，努力做好地方交通和邮电工作。
