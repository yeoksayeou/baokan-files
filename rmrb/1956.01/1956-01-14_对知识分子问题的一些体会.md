Some Experiences on the Issue of Intellectuals
Wu Yingkai, Director of Surgery, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences

The Party and the government have always cared for and valued intellectuals. Since liberation, they have not only arranged jobs for them and taken care of their lives, but also constantly helped them to transform their thinking through theoretical study and practical training, so that their political awareness has been continuously improved. In the past six or seven years, under the influence of the Party's correct policy of unity, education, and transformation, the vast majority of intellectuals are at ease and satisfied with their work, grateful to the Party, and actively enthusiastic about the people's cause.

Due to the rapid development of socialist construction, the progress of general intellectuals cannot keep up with the requirements of the objective situation. In particular, intellectuals who have mastered specialized scientific and technological knowledge need to play a greater role in order to accelerate the country's various construction undertakings. At the same time, some units still have more or less problems in treating intellectuals, and these problems should be resolved.

At present, there are two aspects to the problems existing among medical intellectuals: one is related to work, and the other is related to ideology. These two aspects are mutually influential and interconnected.

In terms of work, the main problems are being busy, having many things to deal with, and being subject to certain limitations in technological development. Some people's academic research, due to detachment from practice and lack of study in recent years, is facing the danger of "not advancing is retreating." Some experts bear too much administrative work and social activities, consuming most of their time and energy. Some experts lack the working conditions for developing certain technologies, such as few beds or lack of necessary research equipment. Some experts have ideological concerns and dare not carry out new therapies and new operations, fearing problems. Many people are also afraid of being labeled with "purely technical viewpoints" or "separation from politics," so they are unwilling to emphasize the importance of technological development. These situations do make it very difficult for senior technicians to exert their technical leadership and improve medical teaching and research work. Whenever academic progress and work level are checked, everyone inevitably feels heavy. When some people participate in international scientific conferences, they feel that our country's political status has been unprecedentedly improved, but the scientific level is not commensurate with this status, which is an extremely sharp stimulus for scientific workers in New China. In order to more effectively fight against diseases and more effectively develop people's health care, we medical scientific workers must strive to improve our medical technology and medical education level, and we must carry out research work. However, the existence of the above-mentioned situations hinders the efforts of experts. Therefore, how to eliminate these difficulties is an urgent problem to be solved.

Our goal is certainly not to make science and technology divorced from the interests of the people and divorced from politics. On the contrary, our goal is to make science and technology better serve socialist construction. The task of intellectuals in the future is to break through the scientific level that is still relatively backward in many aspects, overcome conservative ideas, and strive to move towards the new direction of improving technology and developing business as pointed out by the Party. In order to improve the current situation, it is necessary to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, make overall plans in all aspects, all regions, and all units, and make more effective organization and division of labor for the existing technical forces. For some professionally trained scientific and technical personnel, they should be encouraged to develop technology, and be given as much guarantee as possible in terms of time and working conditions, under the conditions that meet the requirements of national construction and are possible.

Another aspect of the problems existing among intellectuals at present is their own ideological problems and working methods. Since liberation, under the constant care and education of the Party and under the influence of various great political movements, the ideological progress of the broad masses of intellectuals has been significant. They have basically clarified the position of serving the people and have also received preliminary education in class struggle. However, certain bourgeois ideas and old working methods still hinder many intellectuals from playing a greater role in socialist construction. From the ideological criticism movement recently carried out in the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, it can be seen that some of the current ideological problems of intellectuals, at least, reflect the ideological situation of intellectuals in the medical field. In the self-examinations of many teaching staff, they realized that individualism still occupies the depths of their minds; some people show arrogance and complacency, and cannot unite and cooperate with leaders and the masses; some people have serious ideas of personal fame and gain, often worrying about gains and losses, and cannot work with peace of mind; some people feel that personal development has no future, and therefore lack enthusiasm for work and are unwilling to be bold and responsible; some people, under the control of subjective idealism, are detached from reality and detached from the masses in their work. These various bourgeois ideas have brought great harm to the work. Through this ideological criticism, everyone realized that the root cause of the difficulties that existed in the past in not being able to unite well with each other and in the work was these old ideological problems, so the vast majority of people are determined to wage a resolute struggle against individualism in the future, improve socialist consciousness, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers wholeheartedly, and serve the country's socialist construction. The idea of individualism and the habits left over from the old society make many intellectuals still tend to be conservative in their work, do not know how to rely on the organization, cannot see the wisdom and strength of the masses, lack planning in their work, cannot grasp the central link of the work, and do not know how to be careful in the distribution and utilization of time. In this way, it is difficult to give full play to collective strength and use human, material and time resources rationally and effectively.

The road before us intellectuals is very clear. In the great cause of building socialism, the main responsibility of scientific and technical workers is to develop scientific undertakings and serve socialist construction. The Party and the government are closely concerned about intellectuals. In the Constitution, in the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, and in the construction undertakings of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and various government departments, the direction of scientific and technological development and the conditions for ensuring the development of these undertakings are clearly stipulated. We have full confidence in completing our tasks under the leadership of the Party and the government.

The last very important issue is that the Party's leadership over scientific and technological work must be affirmed among intellectuals. In the past, some intellectuals mistakenly believed that the Party did not master technology, so it could not lead scientific and technological work. Scientific and technological work can only be led by technical personnel. In the leadership departments of health work, this mistake has been made for a long time, bringing great losses to the national health work. This is what all scientific and technical intellectuals must be vigilant about. We should recognize that because the Communist Party of China has the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, has rich experience in leading the Chinese people in revolutionary struggles for decades, and is good at summarizing the experience of the masses and giving play to the strength of the masses, the Party can not only lead science and technology, but also scientific and technological work must be developed well under the leadership of the Party. The development of national construction undertakings in all aspects in the past six or seven years has fully proved this point. Therefore, intellectuals must sincerely unite around the Party and actively put forward opinions and rationalization proposals for the work. This can not only strengthen the unity of intellectuals and Party organizations, but also receive the Party's help and education more specifically on many issues. On the part of Party organizations, they must also constantly study all the problems of intellectuals in ideology and work, and give them necessary help and criticism in a timely manner. In this way, it is possible to accelerate the ideological transformation of intellectuals.

    对知识分子问题的一些体会
    中国协和医学院外科主任  吴英恺
    党和政府对于知识分子一直是关怀和重视的。解放以来，不但安排了他们的工作，照顾到他们的生活，并且经常地帮助他们通过理论学习和实际锻炼来改造思想，使他们的政治觉悟不断提高。六、七年来，知识分子在党的团结、教育、改造的正确政策的影响之下，绝大多数对工作是安心的、满意的，对党是感激的，对人民事业是积极热情的。
    由于社会主义建设事业的飞速发展，一般知识分子的进步还赶不上客观形势的要求。特别是掌握专门科学技术的知识分子，需要发挥更大的作用，以加速国家的各项建设事业。同时，某些单位对待知识分子也还存在着或多或少的问题，这些问题是应当解决的。
    目前在医务知识分子中间存在的问题有两方面：一个是属于工作方面，一个是属于思想方面。这两方面是互相影响，互相联系着的。
    在工作方面，主要的问题是工作忙，头绪多，而在技术发展上还受着一定的限制。有些人的学术研究，几年来由于脱离实践、缺乏钻研，正面对着“不进则退”的危险。有些专家负担过多的行政工作和社会活动，消耗了大部分的时间和力量。有些专家缺乏某些发展技术的工作条件，例如病床少或是缺乏必要的研究设备。有些专家在思想上有顾虑，对新疗法新手术不敢开展，怕出问题。还有不少人怕被人戴上“单纯技术观点”或是“脱离政治”的帽子，因而不愿强调技术发展的重要。这些情况，确实使高级技术人员在发挥技术领导作用、提高医疗教学和研究工作上遇到很大的困难。每当检查学术进度和工作水平的时候，大家就难免感到沉重。有些人参加国际科学会议的时候，感到我国的政治地位是空前地提高了，但是科学水平跟这种地位并不相称，这对于新中国的科学工作者来说，是一个异常尖锐的刺激。我们医学科学工作者，为着更有效地向疾病作斗争，更有效地发展人民保健事业，都不能不努力提高我们的医疗技术和医学教育的水平，都不能不开展研究工作。而上述情况的存在，却妨碍着专家们的努力。因此，如何消除这些困难，是一个急待解决的问题。
    我们的目标当然不是要使科学技术脱离人民利益，脱离政治，恰恰相反，我们的目标是要使科学技术更好地为社会主义建设服务。今后知识分子的任务，就是要突破在许多方面我们还比较落后的科学水平，克服保守思想，努力朝着党所指出的提高技术、开展业务的新的方向迈进。为了改进目前的情况，须要遵照毛主席的指示，在各个方面各个地区以及各个单位进行全面规划，对现有的技术力量作更有效的组织和分工。对某些有专业修养的科学技术人员，应该在符合于国家建设的要求和可能的条件之下，鼓励他们发展技术，在时间上和工作条件上尽量地予以保证。
    目前在知识分子中存在的另一方面的问题，就是他们本身的思想问题和工作方法问题。解放以来，在党的不断关怀和教育之下，在各项伟大的政治运动的影响之下，广大知识分子在
  思想方面的进步是显著的，基本上明确了为人民服务的立场，也初步地受到了阶级斗争的教育。但是某些资产阶级思想和旧的工作方法，还阻碍着许多知识分子在社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用。从最近在中国协和医学院进行的思想批判运动中，可以看出目前知识分子的一些思想毛病，至少是反映了医学方面的知识分子的思想情况。在许多教学人员的自我检查中，他们认识到个人主义还盘据在自己的思想深处；有的人表现为骄傲自满，不能同领导者同群众团结合作；有的人有严重的个人名利思想，经常患得患失，不能安心工作；有的人感到个人发展无前途，因而对工作缺乏积极性，不愿大胆负责；有的人在主观唯心主义思想的支配下，在工作中脱离实际，脱离群众。这些形形色色的资产阶级思想，都给工作带来了极大的危害。通过这次的思想批判，大家都认识到在过去彼此不能很好地团结以及工作中存在着的若干困难的根本原因，是这些旧的思想毛病作怪，因而绝大多数人都决心在今后要同个人主义进行坚决的斗争，提高社会主义觉悟，全心全意地为工农兵服务，为国家的社会主义建设服务。个人主义的思想和旧社会遗留下来的习惯，使许多知识分子在工作中还是趋向于保守，不知道依靠组织，看不见群众的智慧和力量，对工作缺乏计划性，不能掌握工作的中心环节，在时间的支配和利用上也不知道精打细算。这样就难以充分发挥集体力量和合理有效地使用人力、物力和时间。
    摆在我们知识分子面前的道路是很明确的。在建设社会主义的伟大事业中，科学技术工作者的主要责任，就是发展科学事业，为社会主义建设服务。党和政府对知识分子是密切地关怀着的。在宪法中，在发展国民经济的第一个五年计划中，以及在中国科学院和各个政府部门的建设事业中，都明确规定了科学技术发展的方向以及为保证这些事业发展的条件。我们有充分的信心在党和政府的领导之下完成自己的任务。
    最后一个十分重要的问题，就是在知识分子中间必须肯定党对科学技术工作的领导。过去有些知识分子，错误地认为党不掌握技术，所以对于科学技术工作不能领导。科学技术工作只能由技术人员来领导。在卫生工作的领导部门中，就曾长期地犯了这个错误，给全国的卫生工作带来极大的损失。这是所有科学技术知识分子所必须警惕的。我们应该认识，由于中国共产党有马克思列宁主义的指导，有几十年领导中国人民进行革命斗争的丰富经验，又善于总结群众的经验和发挥群众的力量，所以党不但能领导科学技术，而且科学技术工作必须是在党的领导之下才能很好地发展。六、七年来，国家各方面建设事业的发展就完全证明了这一点。因此，知识分子必须诚心诚意地团结在党的周围，积极地提出对工作的意见和合理化建议。这样不但能加强知识分子同党组织的团结，而且在许多问题上也能更具体地接受党的帮助和教育。在党组织方面，也必须经常研究知识分子在思想上和工作上的一切问题，及时地给以必要的帮助和批评。这样，才有可能加速知识分子的思想改造。
