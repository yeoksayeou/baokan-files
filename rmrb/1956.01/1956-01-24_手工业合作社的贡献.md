The 11 ironware production cooperatives (groups) in Lanzhou City, after being organized, improved their labor organization and operating methods, increased production efficiency, and improved product quality, and lowered costs. From November 26th of last year, they reduced the selling price of 23 products, including claw hammers, choppers, iron shovels, mattocks, kitchen knives, and iron spoons, by 3% to 28%. After lowering the selling prices, the business of each cooperative (group) developed.

After the cooperativization of handicrafts, it created good conditions for improving production and lowering selling prices on the one hand; on the other hand, it also put forward higher requirements for handicraft laborers. We hope that in the surging wave of rapid development of handicraft cooperativization in various places, we will hear more production successes like those of the Lanzhou ironware production cooperatives.

    手工业合作社的贡献
    兰州市11个铁器生产合作社（组）在组织起来以后，改善了劳动组织和操作方法，提高了生产效率，改善了产品质量，降低了成本。从去年11月26日起，他们把钉锤、铡刀、铁锨、镢头、菜刀、铁勺等23种产品的售价，降低了3％至28％。降低售价以后，各社（组）的营业都发展了。
    手工业合作化之后，一方面给改善生产、降低售价创造了良好的条件；一方面也向手工业劳动者们提出了更高的要求。我们希望，在各地手工业合作化猛烈发展的声浪中，更多地听到像兰州市铁器生产合作社这样的生产捷报。
