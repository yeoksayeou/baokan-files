Public Opinion in Various Countries Attacks Dulles for Advocating "Policy of Strength"

    Chairman of the American Communist Party
    Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, published an article in the "Daily Worker" on Dulles's speech. The article pointed out that "The main purpose of Dulles's talk, published in 'Life' magazine and advocating the so-called 'brink of war' policy with his approval, is to lay the foundation for the restoration of the 'Cold War'."
    Foster pointed out that Dulles insisted that his practice of bringing the United States to the brink of war seemed to have saved world peace three times, and Dulles intended to use this strange argument to "continue war preparations on all fronts." Foster continued that war was prevented not because he, as Dulles boasted, brought the whole world to the brink of atomic war, but because of the struggle to safeguard peace and the firm peace policy of the socialist camp, and because of the anti-war sentiment of peace-loving people in all countries of the world.
    Foster then emphasized the important role of the American people's anti-war sentiment.
    Foster finally called on the working class and all peace forces in the United States to actively oppose Dulles's "brink of war" policy, demand a reduction in huge military expenditures, and implement a policy of genuine peaceful coexistence.
    British Newspapers
    British newspapers have commented on Dulles's statement at a press conference on the 17th regarding his "brink of war" policy, which has aroused public outrage around the world.
    The "Manchester Guardian" editorial wrote that Dulles once again attempted at the press conference to "revise history to suit his own imperfect memory." The newspaper pointed out that Dulles "displayed surprising blindness" on the Far East situation.
    The newspaper's Washington correspondent accused Dulles's speech at the press conference of being an "irresponsible" diplomatic policy based on "atomic threats."
    The "Times" Washington correspondent wrote that at the press conference, Dulles "took a more subtle evasive action than he took in the storm caused by the publication of his interview in 'Life' magazine"... The correspondent said: Under a series of questions, Dulles once again acknowledged the substance of the statement that he made, without denying the other parts of the article.
    Pakistan Times
    The "Pakistan Times" editorial, commenting on Dulles's interview with "Life" magazine, said that Dulles once again boasted of the belligerent and bankrupt policy of conducting international negotiations from a position of atomic war threat. The newspaper pointed out that if the United States continues to follow such a policy, sooner or later it will drag its own country and the rest of the world into the abyss of a devastating atomic war. The newspaper emphasized that as long as the US foreign policy does not change, the danger of another war will always exist.

    各国公众舆论抨击杜勒斯鼓吹“实力政策”
    美共主席
    美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特在“工人日报”上就杜勒斯谈话发表了一篇文章。文章指出，“‘生活’杂志上刊载的、杜勒斯认可的宣扬所谓‘战争边缘’政策的谈话，其主要目的是为恢复‘冷战’奠定基础。”
    福斯特指出，杜勒斯硬说，他使美国濒临战争的边缘的做法似乎三次挽救了世界和平，杜勒斯打算用这种奇怪的说法来使得“在各个战线上继续战争准备”。福斯特继续说，战争得以防止不是因为像杜勒斯所吹嘘的他把整个世界引到原子战争的边缘，而是由于争取维护和平的斗争和社会主义阵营的坚定的和平政策，由于世界爱好和平的各国人民的反战情绪。
    福斯特接着强调指出了美国人民反战情绪的重要作用。
    福斯特最后号召工人阶级和美国所有和平力量积极反对杜勒斯的“战争边缘”政策，要求缩减庞大的军事开支和执行真正和平共处的政策。
    英国报纸
    英国报纸纷纷评论杜勒斯17日在记者招待会上发表的关于他引起世界舆论公愤的“战争边缘”政策的谈话的声明。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”社论写道，杜勒斯在记者招待会上又一次企图“修改历史，使它适合于自己的不完善的记忆”。报纸指出，杜勒斯在远东局势问题上“表现了令人吃惊的盲目”。
    这家报纸的驻华盛顿记者指责杜勒斯在记者招待会上的讲话是以“原子威胁”为基础的“不负责任的”外交方针。
    “泰晤士报”驻华盛顿记者写道，在记者招待会上，杜勒斯“少有地采取了比他在‘生活’杂志上的答记者问发表后所引起的风波中所采取的更为巧妙的规避行动”……这位记者说：在一连串的问题下，杜勒斯再一次承认了说是他发表的声明的实质，而并未否认这篇文章的其他部分。
    巴基斯坦时报
    “巴基斯坦时报”的社论在评论杜勒斯对“生活”杂志的谈话的时候说，杜勒斯又一次把从原子战争威胁的地位来进行国际谈判这种好战的并且是破了产的政策吹嘘了一番。这家报纸指出，如果美国继续遵循这样一种政策，它迟早将把它自己的国家以及世界其他地方拖入一场毁灭性的原子战争的深渊中。这家报纸着重指出，只要美国的外交政策不改变，另一次战争的危险总是存在的。
