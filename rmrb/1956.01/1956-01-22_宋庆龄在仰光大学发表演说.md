Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, January 21st: Soong Ching-ling, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of thePeople’s Republic of China, delivered a speech at Rangoon University on the 20th.

Soong Ching-ling first spoke about the current world situation. She said that the forces supporting world peace and international friendship have now developed to an unprecedented degree. I am referring to the forces in the world that are striving to ease international tensions and to resolve international issues through negotiations and conferences.

Soong Ching-ling said: Peace-loving governments and peoples of various countries have cooperated in the past few years and have achieved great accomplishments, facilitating the armistice in Korea and Indochina. The results of the Bandung Asian-African Conference and the Geneva Four-Power Summit show that the forces for world peace have further developed. She pointed out that an increasing number of countries have adopted the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence formulated and announced by India, China, and Burma, which have now become the standard of international morality. The zone of peace is constantly expanding, where threats and interference are being replaced by friendship and cooperation. Since the Bandung Conference, the peoples of Asia and Africa have demonstrated an increasingly powerful force in resisting foreign interference, territorial division, and foreign military occupation. They also oppose threats and embargoes that only hinder and obstruct their commercial and economic development.

Soong Ching-ling said that the fact is that the vast majority of people in the world demand peace. The forces in the world striving for peace, for national independence, and for liberation from the shackles of colonialism are growing stronger, especially in Asian and African countries that have suffered from and are currently suffering from the harm of colonialism, which are bound to sympathize with each other. International friendship, once interrupted by colonialism, is now rapidly being restored among us.

Soong Ching-ling then said: All this has caused anxiety among the colonialists. They are still attempting to divide us by all means—by organizing aggressive alliances and military blocs, by open threats, and by so-called foreign aid. In fact, they are still trying to pursue their policy of using Asians to fight Asians in the conspiracy of slaughtering the world. Our experience and our common sense tell us that we must be vigilant, and we must redouble our efforts to unite in this common struggle against colonialism and slavery. The peoples of Asia are now awakened and will never again be helpless in the face of their enemies.

Soong Ching-ling then introduced the situation of higher education in China. She pointed out the importance of higher education for the cause of socialist construction. Soong Ching-ling said that in China, great importance is attached to the fact that higher education and economic construction are inseparable. On the one hand, higher education cultivates talents for national construction; on the other hand, the achievements of economic construction and economic development inevitably further promote higher education.

Soong Ching-ling concluded by saying that the future of the Burmese people is bright because you are building your national economy in order to eliminate the remaining influence of imperialism and consolidate national independence. I believe that you will unite as one, and on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, you will further contribute to consolidating world peace. I also believe that your friendship and cooperation with all peace-loving countries, such as the Soviet Union and China, will grow day by day.

    宋庆龄在仰光大学发表演说
    新华社仰光21日电　中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄20日在仰光大学发表了演说。
    宋庆龄首先谈到目前的世界局势。她说，拥护世界和平和国际友谊的力量现在已经发展到了过去从未有过的程度。我指的是世界上争取缓和国际紧张局势，争取通过谈判和会议来解决国际问题的力量。
    宋庆龄说：爱好和平的各国政府和人民在过去几年中进行了合作并且取得了很大的成就，促成了朝鲜和印度支那的停战。万隆亚非会议和日内瓦的四大国最高级会议的结果表明，世界和平力量是进一步发展了。她指出：越来越多的国家采纳了由印度、中国和缅甸制定和宣布的和平共处五项原则，这些原则现在已经成为国际道德的标准。和平地区不断扩大，在那里，威胁和干涉正在被友谊和合作所代替。自从万隆会议以来，亚非各国人民表现了日益强大的力量来抵抗外国干涉、领土分裂和外国军事占领。他们还反对只会妨碍与阻挠他们商业和经济发展的威胁和禁运。
    宋庆龄说，事实是，世界上绝大多数的人要求和平。世界的争取和平、争取民族独立、争取挣脱殖民主义枷锁的力量正在日益壮大，特别是在亚洲和非洲过去遭受过和现在正在遭受殖民主义之害的国家，是一定会相互同情的。一度被殖民主义打断的国际友谊现在正在我们中间迅速地恢复起来。
    宋庆龄接着说：所有这一切引起了殖民主义者的不安。他们仍然企图用一切办法来分化我们——用组织侵略联盟和军事集团的办法、用公开的威胁和用所谓的对外援助。实际上，他们仍然企图奉行他们的在世界屠杀的阴谋中利用亚洲人来打亚洲人的政策。我们的经验和我们的常识告诉我们，我们必须提高警惕，我们必须加倍努力在这个反对殖民主义和奴役的共同斗争中团结起来。亚洲各国人民现在觉醒了，而且决不会再对他们的敌人束手无策了。
    宋庆龄接着介绍了中国高等教育的情况。她指出了高等教育对于社会主义建设事业的重要性。宋庆龄说，在中国，非常重视这个事实：高等教育和经济建设是不可分的。一方面高等教育培养建国人材，另一方面经济建设和经济发展的成就必然进一步促进高等教育。
    宋庆龄最后说，缅甸人民的前途是光明的，因为你们正在建设你们的国民经济，以便消除帝国主义的残余影响并且巩固国家的独立。我相信你们一定会团结一致，在和平共处的五项原则的基础上，你们将进一步对巩固世界和平作出贡献。我还相信，你们同所有爱好和平的国家、如苏联和中国的友谊和合作将会日益增长。
