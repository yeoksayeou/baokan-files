New Plays Staged in Beijing

The China Youth Art Theater staged a new play "Liu Hulan," written and directed by Yu Cun, on the 5th. This is the first new play staged in Beijing this year.

Beijing's drama directors and actors are now rushing to rehearse many new plays. The China Youth Art Theater has already begun rehearsing Lao She's newly created multi-act satirical drama "Looking West to Chang'an." The China Children's Theater will also stage a new fairy tale play "Malan Flower" in January. The actors of the Beijing People's Art Theater are currently simultaneously rehearsing Hu Danfei's play "Spring Blossoms," reflecting agricultural cooperation, and Lao She's multi-act play "Youth Shock Brigade," depicting the growth of the capital's construction worker youth shock brigade. These two plays will be staged successively in January and February. The Beijing People's Art Theater will also invite Soviet drama experts to guide the rehearsal of Gorky's famous play "Yegor Bulichov" and the Czechoslovakian fairy tale play "The Piper."
