Relying on the Party Branch to Transform a Backward Township
By our reporter, Gu Weijin

Before last spring, Linjiang Township in Echeng County, Hubei Province, was a backward township without a single cooperative. By the end of last year, this township had become a basically semi-socialist cooperative township. This rapid change proves that as long as we rely on the Party organization and on the poor and lower-middle peasants, we can definitely transform a backward township into an advanced township.

The reason Linjiang Township was backward was that counter-revolutionaries, landlords, rich peasants, and hooligans controlled a part of the township government. Most of the 21 mutual aid teams in the township were controlled by bad elements and upper-middle peasants. The Party organization in this township was also very weak, having developed only four Party members and established a temporary branch during the disaster relief campaign in 1954.

In order to change the backward state of Linjiang Township, the Echeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a work team to Linjiang Township last spring. At that time, the township had just suffered from a flood, and the masses were urgently demanding the resumption of production and the solution of the spring famine. The work team and the township branch, based on this situation, decided to mobilize the masses by starting with the organization of production.

At that time, the four probationary Party members of the branch, although lacking work experience, did not have enough confidence in transforming the backward township. But they were all poor peasants and willing to work for the Party. The work team adopted a completely correct approach, not abandoning them, but relying on them. The work team first assisted the branch in classifying all 77 cadres in the township, which clarified the objects of reliance, cultivation, and elimination. The work team also assisted the branch in selecting 12 poor and lower-middle peasants from the existing cadres who were active in their work and firm in their stance to participate in the necessary meetings of the branch and jointly study the work, in order to strengthen the leadership of the branch.

In this way, the branch's understanding was improved, its confidence was strengthened, and its work became more active and proactive. Through the resumption of production, the number of mutual aid teams in the township increased from the original 21 to 37. The branch helped the mutual aid teams to rationally arrange labor into agricultural and sideline production. In just over a month, agricultural and sideline production achieved great results. Sideline income exceeded 10,000 yuan, which, in addition to solving the livelihood difficulties of the masses, was also used to purchase fertilizer and topdress 1,810 mu of wheat land. In addition, more than 2,000 mu of wheat were replanted, and ditching and drainage increased arable land by more than 3,000 mu.

At this time, bad elements also stepped up their sabotage activities. Some burned account books, some squeezed poor peasants out of the teams, and some even incited the mutual aid teams to disband. Because the branch had achieved great success in leading the masses in production, its prestige was greatly enhanced, and it decided to seize the opportunity to rectify the mutual aid teams and remove these bad elements. The branch successively convened meetings of Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists in the mutual aid teams, and a representative meeting of mutual aid teams in the township, exposing the destructive facts of the bad elements and mobilizing everyone to discuss them. Finally, the meeting resolved to expel 13 bad elements from the teams, and the counter-revolutionaries and bullies who aroused great popular indignation were arrested by the government in accordance with the law. Among these 13 bad elements, seven had usurped the positions of members of the township People's Committee, and their positions were revoked after discussion at the township People's Congress meeting.

In this struggle, many activists with firm positions emerged. The branch, in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution, admitted five poor peasant activists into the Party; it also changed the temporary branch into a formal branch. In addition, the Communist Youth League organization also developed 11 new Youth League members.

Next, the branch, while continuing to lead and consolidate the mutual aid teams, transformed the mutual aid team led by branch secretary Jin Huazhang into a cooperative, providing a demonstration for the whole township.

This cooperative was composed of 13 poor peasant households and 3 lower-middle peasant households. In the early days of its establishment, it lacked livestock, farm implements, and fertilizer; the spring famine had not yet passed, and the lives of the members were also difficult. The branch first used great effort to lead the cooperative in sideline production, solving the livelihood difficulties of the members and the difficulties of production materials. Then, it used great effort to lead the cooperative in striving for increased wheat production, such as applying sufficient topdressing fertilizer to the wheat fields and promoting advanced cultivation methods. By the summer harvest, the superiority of the cooperative was initially revealed: the average yield of wheat per mu in the cooperative was 195 jin, 145 jin in Jin Qifa's mutual aid team, and only 123 jin in the five individual peasant households.

Even before the wheat harvest of the cooperative, the branch had selected two mutual aid teams as key cultivation teams in preparation for conversion to cooperatives. Now, with the increased wheat production of the cooperative and the branch's publicity of the superiority of the cooperative, many mutual aid teams are requesting to convert to cooperatives, and the number of mutual aid teams in the township has also increased from 36 to 49.

The branch, with the assistance of the work team, decided to seize this opportunity to advance the mutual aid and cooperation movement further. The branch convened a representative meeting of mutual aid and cooperation in the township, proposing the conditions for mutual aid teams to convert to cooperatives. It called on everyone to select the objects of conversion based on these conditions. As a result, the key teams cultivated by the branch were selected as conversion teams.

After these two mutual aid teams converted to cooperatives, it was a great education for all the mutual aid teams in the township. They put forward the slogan of "learning from the mutual aid teams that have converted to cooperatives," some teams implemented small-scale contracting, and some merged into joint teams, actively laying the foundation for conversion to cooperatives.

The work team and the branch saw that a high tide of cooperativization was about to arrive in the township. In order to accelerate the arrival of this high tide, in addition to strengthening the leadership of the mutual aid teams, cultivating accounting personnel, and building the Party and the Communist Youth League, the branch had another serious task, which was to lead the old cooperative to strive for a bumper harvest of cotton, the main crop of the township. However, because the cooperative had a weak land base and poor livestock and farm implements, the cotton seedlings of the cooperative were not as good as those of the well-to-do peasants in the first cotton competition in the township. Therefore, some well-to-do peasants thought that it was simply a joke for the cotton of the cooperative to compete with their cotton.

The problem was posed in this way: if the cotton of the cooperative could not outperform the cotton of the well-to-do peasants by the autumn harvest, the large-scale development of the cooperative would be affected. Therefore, the branch launched a discussion among the members of the cooperative through the cooperative management committee on how to make the cotton grow well. Everyone agreed that first of all, sufficient fertilizer should be applied, and secondly, technical management should be strengthened. So the members used a large amount of the surplus from the bumper wheat harvest to purchase fertilizer and apply it to the cotton fields. During the second cotton competition, the cotton seedlings of the cooperative became lush, and some cotton seedlings grew better than those of the well-to-do peasants. Old upper-middle peasant Jin Langqing and others were very unconvinced. At night, they secretly applied fertilizer to their own fields. However, the well-to-do peasants did not believe in advanced technology, and their technical management was relatively poor. As a result, the cooperative's cotton produced an average of 51 jin of ginned cotton per mu, while the cotton of the well-to-do peasants produced an average of 40 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

The bumper harvest of cotton in the cooperative did indeed accelerate the arrival of a high tide of cooperativization. Mutual aid teams applied to convert to cooperatives in batches, and many individual peasants also applied to join the cooperatives. At this time, Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" was disseminated to the township, which was a great encouragement to the broad masses to take the road of cooperativization. By the end of November last year, 16 cooperatives had been built in the township, and together with the original three cooperatives, the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounted for 70.4% of the total number of peasant households in the township. The township basically realized semi-socialist cooperativization. The branch actively built the Party and the Communist Youth League in the process of building cooperatives, and the number of Party members in the township increased from the original 4 to 31; the number of Communist Youth League members increased from the original 24 to 77.

Now, Linjiang Township is no longer what it was before last spring, it has moved from a backward position to the ranks of the advanced; the Linjiang Township branch is also no longer what it was before last spring. It has changed from a weak and powerless organization into a fighting fortress for the Party to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    依靠党支部改造落后乡
    本报记者　古维进
    去年春天以前，湖北省鄂城县临江乡还是没有一个合作社的落后乡。到去年年底，这个乡已经变成基本上半社会主义合作化的乡了。这个迅速的变化证明，只要依靠党的组织，依靠贫农和下中农，一定可以把落后乡变成先进乡。
    临江乡之所以落后，是因为反革命分子和地主、富农、流氓分子掌握了一部分乡政权。全乡21个互助组，大部分被掌握在坏分子和上中农的手里。而这个乡的党组织的力量又很薄弱，1954年的生产救灾运动中才发展了四个党员，成立了一个临时支部。
    为了改变临江乡的落后状态，去年春天中共鄂城县委派出工作组到临江乡工作。当时这个乡刚刚遭过水灾，群众迫切要求恢复生产和解决春荒问题。工作组和乡支部就根据这一情况，决定从组织生产入手发动群众。
    当时支部的四个候补党员，虽然还缺乏工作经验，改造落后乡的信心也还不足。但他们都是贫农，愿意为党工作。工作组采取了完全正确的方针，不是抛开他们，而是依靠他们。工作组首先协助支部把全乡的77个干部进行了分类排队，这就明确了依靠、培养和清除的对象。工作组又协助支部从现有干部中挑选出12个工作积极、立场坚定的贫农和下中农参加支部的必要会议，共同研究工作，以加强支部的领导力量。
    这样支部的认识提高了，信心增强了，工作更加积极主动了。通过恢复生产，全乡互助组由原有的21个发展到37个。支部帮助互助组把劳力合理地安排到农、副业生产中去。不过一个多月光景，农、副业生产就取得很大的成绩。副业收入一万多元，除了解决群众的生活困难，还购买肥料，在1，810亩小麦地上了追肥。此外，还补种小麦两千多亩，开沟、排水增加可耕田地三千多亩。
    这时，坏分子也加紧了破坏活动。有的烧掉账簿，有的排挤贫农出组，有的甚至煽动互助组散伙。而支部由于领导群众在生产上取得很大成绩，威信大大提高，就决定抓住时机整顿互助组，把这些坏分子清除出去。支部即先后召集了互助组里的党团员积极分子会议和全乡互助组代表会议，揭露了坏分子的破坏事实，发动大家讨论。最后会议决议把13个坏分子开除出组，其中的反革命分子和民愤很大的恶霸分子，由政府依法逮捕。在这13个坏分子中，有七个篡夺了乡人民委员会委员的职位，经过乡人民代表大会会议的讨论，撤销了他们的职务。
    在这一斗争中，涌现出许多立场坚定的积极分子。支部按照党章规定，吸收了其中的五个贫农积极分子入党；还把临时支部改为正式支部。另外团组织还发展了11个青年团员。
    接着，支部一面继续领导和巩固互助组，一面把支部书记金华章领导的互助组转为合作社，给全乡示范。
    这个合作社由13户贫农和3户下中农组成。建社初期，缺乏牲口、农具、肥料；春荒还没有过去，社员的生活也很困难。支部首先就用很大力量领导合作社进行副业生产，解决了社员的生活困难和生产资料的困难。接着又用很大力量，领导合作社争取小麦增产，例如在麦地里上足追肥和推广先进的耕作方法。到了夏收，合作社的优越性初步显示出来了，合作社的小麦每亩平均产量是195斤，金启发互助组是145斤，而五户个体农民的小麦只有123斤。
    还在合作社的小麦收割以前，支部就挑选了两个互助组作为准备转社的重点培养组。现在，随着合作社的小麦增产和支部对合作社的优越性的宣传，有不少的互助组要求转社，全乡互助组也由36个发展到49个。
    支部在工作组的协助下，决定抓住这个机会把互助合作运动推进一步。支部召开了全乡的互助合作代表会议，提出互助组转社的条件。号召大家根据这些条件评选转社的对象。结果，支部培养的重点组被评选为转社组。
    这两个互助组转社后，对全乡所有互助组是个很大的教育。他们提出了“向转社的互助组看齐”的口号，有的组推行小包工，有的组并为联组，积极为转社打基础。
    工作组和支部看出，全乡的合作化运动高潮快要到来了。为了加速这一高潮的到来，支部除了加强对互助组的领导，培养会计人员，建党建团的工作之外，还有一个严重的任务，就是领导老社争取这个乡的主要农作物棉花的丰收。而这个合作社由于土地底子薄，牲口农具也不好，在全乡进行第一次棉花评比的时候，合作社的棉苗还不如富裕农民的棉苗。因此，有些富裕农民认为合作社的棉花要同他们的棉花比赛，这简直是笑话。
    问题就这样摆着：到了秋收，如果合作社的棉花赛不过富裕农民的棉花，合作社的大量发展就会受到影响。因此，支部就通过社务委员会发动社员讨论怎样才能使棉花长好。大家一致认为首先应该上足肥料，其次就是加强技术管理。于是社员把小麦丰收分得的盈余大量购买肥料上到棉花地里。第二次棉花评比的时候，合作社的棉苗茂盛起来了，有些棉苗比富裕农民的棉苗长得好。老上中农金朗清等很不服气。夜里，他们都在自己的地里偷偷上肥料。但是，富裕农民不相信先进技术，技术管理都比较差。结果合作社的棉花每亩平均产皮棉51斤，富裕农民的棉花每亩平均产皮棉40斤。
    合作社棉花的丰产，果然加速了合作化运动高潮的到来。互助组一批一批地申请转社，许多个体农民也申请入社。这时，毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告传达到乡里，对广大群众走合作化道路更是莫大的鼓舞。到去年11月底，全乡已建成了16个社，连原有的三个社，入社农户占全乡总农户的70.4％。全乡基本上实现了半社会主义合作化。支部在建社当中积极建党建团，全乡党员由原有的4个发展到31个；青年团员由原有的24个发展到77个。
    现在，临江乡不再是去年春天以前的样子了，它已经从落后的地位进入先进的行列；临江乡的支部也不再是去年春天以前的样子了。它已经从软弱无力的组织变成党对农业实行社会主义改造的战斗堡垒。
