Placed in a More Isolated Position
--Foreign Opinion on Eisenhower's State of the Union Address--
Qin Benli

In recent days, foreign newspapers and political figures have been widely commenting on the State of the Union address recently presented by US President Eisenhower. While opinions vary, they can generally be summarized as this conclusion, as the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" commented, "This address lacks the new spirit and new policies to deal with the international situation after the Big Four Conference..."

Since the Geneva Four-Power Summit, the call for peaceful coexistence and increased international cooperation has become the mainstream of international developments; the "position of strength" policy and "Cold War" measures have failed. Calmly assessing the international situation and formulating correct policies on this basis is precisely the talent needed by realistic politicians. But the drafters of this address do not seem to be such. Japanese "Kyodo News" reporters Iwate and Ishizuka reported, "The State of the Union address judges that there have been no fundamental changes in the international situation; it can also be seen from the large proportion of military spending in the budget that the policy of maintaining a 'position of strength' is being upheld." The drafters of the address did not learn from the past lessons of the international situation, which emphatically demonstrated the need to abandon the "position of strength" and "Cold War" measures.

In order to prove that continuing to implement this policy and these measures is correct and necessary, the drafters of the address did not hesitate to distort and reverse well-known facts. Things reached such an extent that they attributed the lack of results at last year's Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference to the Soviet Union's "unwillingness to create the conditions necessary for a reliable and lasting peace." In fact, who doesn't know that it was not the Soviet Union that hindered the agreement from being reached at this conference, but the other party negotiating with the Soviet Union. Not long ago, British Labour Party Lord Chorley admitted that the Western countries bear a major responsibility for the failure of the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference. He said, "I think the theory that only Western countries are right cannot withstand any rebuttal... In fact, in my opinion, Western countries are implementing an outdated policy of strength. On the Soviet side, I think it has made many major concessions and implemented a much more flexible policy than us, thus gaining an advantage." The problem was precisely that the proposals put forward by the representatives of Western countries on the conference agenda directly contradicted the instructions of the heads of government of the Four Powers and violated the desire of the people of the world to further ease international tensions, which prevented the conference from succeeding.

The drafters of the address defended the continued implementation of this policy by repeating the old tune of so-called "liberating" the "enslaved" people's democratic countries. Dulles on January 9 once again clamored that the "peaceful liberation" of the Eastern European people's democratic countries is a major goal of American foreign policy. This can only prove once again that the American ruling clique is attempting to rudely interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

Precisely because the American ruling clique is unwilling to give up and is keen on the "policy of strength," the "State of the Union Address" not only defends the "policy of strength," but also tries its best to boast about the achievements of this policy. However, even some American political figures have expressed different opinions on this, although they do not oppose this policy and these measures. For example, Democratic Senator Morse said in his comment on the State of the Union address that "the interests of the free world (should be read as the interests of American foreign expansion) have suffered many unnecessary setbacks in recent months," and "the claim that the government's foreign policy has achieved success is not in accordance with the facts." Republican Senator Jenner also said that he cannot hold the same "optimistic attitude" toward foreign affairs as the President. Everyone knows that Jenner is one of the people who is extremely enthusiastic about the "position of strength" policy and "Cold War" measures.

Therefore, it is no coincidence that Dulles' foreign policy was severely criticized at the closed-door meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on January 5, in which Secretary of State Dulles participated. One of the members who participated in this meeting said that in his memory, "a congressional committee has never made such a condemnation of a Secretary of State as it has of Dulles."

The truth of the matter is that the hypocritical optimism in the address is used to try its best to cover up the failure of the "position of strength" policy.

The important American newspapers have almost unanimous opinions on this point, that the American "position of strength" policy suffered a great failure in 1955. They mentioned that one of the reasons for the failure is that "neutralism has grown surprisingly," "the confrontation of neutral countries" is "increasing," and people are "determined to avoid a nuclear war," which makes the series of military blocs organized by the United States face the "danger" of being "overturned." For example, the American newspapers revealed the poor preparedness of the member states of the North Atlantic Alliance is one example. It is worth mentioning an article written by Miller from Paris published in the "Wall Street Journal" on December 25 last year. The author complained that some Western European countries did not spend a large amount of money as required by Washington "to implement a proposal passed a year ago, that is, the armed forces of the North Atlantic Alliance in Europe should be trained in atomic warfare and equipped accordingly." Therefore, he advocated that the United States needs to "find a stimulant" "to restore life to this listless organization." It is out of such a requirement that the drafters of the address proudly praised the system of military alliances and blocs aimed at the freedom-loving people of all countries, and proposed to strengthen it in the future, to maintain a "deterrent military force" and rely on the "power of the atom."

As a result, the American ruling clique's war plans were exposed once again. An article by Hamilton published in the American "New York Times" on January 9 said that "there is no mention of prohibiting or restricting the use of nuclear weapons" in this State of the Union address. But he emphasized even more that "by announcing that Washington no longer supports any suggestions that the United States had put forward or accepted in the first seven or eight years of negotiations on disarmament, the United States' position has been weakened." Hamilton also said that the United States' attitude towards disarmament will allow "European neutralism" to continue to "grow," which is "one of the most difficult diplomatic problems facing the United States." It should be said that such an estimate is in line with objective reality.

Another reason for the failure of the American "position of strength" policy in 1955, as the editorial in the "Washington Post" said, is that the "momentum for independence generated by the Bandung Conference appeared in resisting military treaties such as the Southeast Asia Organization." "The same influence can also be seen in the United Nations. The prestige of the United States in the United Nations has been declining." The tremendous influence of the Soviet leaders' visits to India, Burma, and Afghanistan made the American ruling clique even more alarmed and uneasy. Republican Senator Ralph Flanders, who had just returned from traveling in India and other places, also admitted that "millions of Indians are convinced that the Russians are 'lovers of mankind and saviors of the world.'" There is no doubt that the increasing awakening of the Asian and African people who have suffered from colonialism and oppression for a long time and their determination to control their own destiny is a heavy blow to the colonialists and the imperialists who are trying to provoke a new war in this region. Of course, they are not reconciled to their failure.

The drafters of the address emphasized this time that they should expand foreign "aid," and especially proposed to increase "aid" to Asia as the center of foreign policy, which shows this.

American foreign "aid" is nothing new. The real attempt to talk about foreign "aid" this time is just like a Chinese saying, "Sima Zhao's heart is known to everyone." According to a New York telegram from "Indian Press Trust" on January 5, because this address mentioned that the United States' foreign "aid" is to help "countries struggling to maintain their freedom against the threat of communist oppression and subversion," even UN representatives felt "disappointed" because this "makes the 'Cold War' mentality and the 'Cold War' attitude towards international issues continue to exist."

The French weekly "International Forum" revealed that the content of the so-called increase in American foreign "aid" is that "according to the State Department's plan, military aid will increase from 1.022 billion US dollars to 3.24 billion US dollars. As for economic aid, the expected increase is much smaller, that is, from 1.681 billion US dollars to 1.906 billion US dollars. "No matter what the name of the American foreign "aid" is, it is essentially a new form of colonialists enslaving the people of other countries. "New York Post" reporter Rasch reported that one point that people from the Bandung Conference countries of the United Nations paid special attention to in this address is that "the address did not mention colonialism in Asia and Africa," and a telegram from "Indian Press Trust" said that this is the "most important aspect" of this address. This is very interesting. No matter how the United States uses foreign "aid" to dress itself up as a "philanthropist," the original form of the colonialists cannot be hidden after all.

This address shows that the drafters of the address still advocate the implementation of the "position of strength" policy. This policy has long been condemned by world opinion. Facts will prove that this policy will not allow the United States to get rid of the dead end in foreign policy, nor will it improve its international position. On the contrary, it will surely make the United States more isolated in diplomacy and make its policies more sharply conflict with the wishes of the people of all countries.

    处于更加孤立的地位
    ——外国舆论评艾森豪威尔的国情咨文——
    钦本立
    这些天来，外国报刊和政界人物正在广泛评论美国总统艾森豪威尔最近提出的国情咨文。评论的意见虽不尽相同，但大体上可以归纳成这样一个结论，正如日本“朝日新闻”的评论所说，“这篇咨文缺少对付四大国会议后国际形势中……的新精神和新政策”。
    自日内瓦四国政府首脑会议召开以后，要求和平共处和增进国际合作，已成为国际局势发展的主流；“实力地位”政策和“冷战”措施遭到了失败。冷静地估计国际局势这个特点，并在这个基础上定出正确的政策，这正是现实的政治家所需要的才干。但这篇咨文的起草人看来不是这样的。日本“共同社”记者岩立和石塚的报道说，“国情咨文判断说国际形势没有基本的变化；从军费在预算方面占很大一部分这一点也可以看出维持‘实力立场’的方针。”咨文的起草人没有记取以往国际局势着重表明必须放弃“实力立场”和“冷战”措施的教训。
    为了证明继续执行这个政策和措施是正确和必要的，咨文的起草人不惜采取了歪曲和颠倒众所周知的事实的办法。事情竟达到这样的程度，他们把去年日内瓦四国外长会议的没有结果，归咎于苏联“不愿意创造一个可靠的和持久的和平所必须的条件”。实际上谁不知道，阻挠这次会议不能达成协议的不是苏联，而是同苏联谈判的对方。不久前英国工党上院议员乔利勋爵就承认说，西方国家对日内瓦四国外长会议的失败负有重大责任。他说，“我认为只有西方国家有道理这种理论是经不起任何驳斥的……实际上，在我看来，西方国家在执行着过时了的实力政策。而在苏联方面，我认为它已经作了许多重大的让步，执行了比我们灵活得多的政策，因而取得了优势。”问题正是由于西方国家代表就会议议程提出的建议，同四大国政府首脑指示直接抵触而且违背了世界人民要求进一步缓和国际紧张局势的愿望，使会议没有成功。
    咨文的起草人为继续执行这种政策作辩护，还重复提出所谓“解放”受到“奴役”的人民民主国家的老调。杜勒斯在1月9日又再次叫嚷什么“和平解放”东欧各人民民主国家是美国对外政策的一大目标。这只能又一次证明美国统治集团企图粗暴地干涉他国内政。
    正由于美国统治集团不愿意放弃并且热衷于“实力政策”，因而“国情咨文”不仅为“实力政策”辩护，并且还竭力吹嘘这一政策的成就。但是，就连美国一些政界人物，对此也表示了不同的意见，虽然他们并不反对这种政策和措施。譬如，民主党参议员莫尔斯在评论国情咨文时说，“自由世界的利益（应读为美国对外扩张的利益）在最近几个月中受到了许多不必要的挫折”，“政府的外交政策有了成就的说法是不符合于事实的”。共和党参议员真纳也说，他不能够像总统一样对外交事务抱“乐观态度”。大家知道，真纳是极端热心于“实力地位”政策和“冷战”措施的人物之一。
    因而，在1月5日举行的有国务卿杜勒斯参加的众议院外交委员会秘密会议上，杜勒斯的外交政策受到了严厉的批评不是偶然的。一个参加这次会议的议员说，在他的记忆里，“国会委员会从来还没有对一个国务卿作过像对杜勒斯这样的谴责”。
    问题的真相正是在于：咨文中这种虚伪的乐观主义是用来竭力掩饰“实力地位”政策的失败。
    美国的重要报刊对于这一点几乎有着一致的意见，就是美国的“实力地位”政策在1955年遭到了很大的失败。它们提到失败的原因之一，是“中立主义惊人壮大”，“中立国家的对抗”“日趋增长”，人们“决心要避免一次核子战争”，这就使得美国组织的一系列军事集团有被“推翻”的“危险”。譬如，美国报刊透露的关于北大西洋联盟成员国的备战不力就是一个例子。值得提到的是去年12月25日“华尔街日报”发表的米勒从巴黎写来的一篇文章，作者抱怨说，某些西欧国家并没有按照华盛顿的要求拿出大量开支“来实现一年前通过的一项主张，这就是北大西洋联盟在全欧洲的武装部队应该受原子战争的训练，并且相应地装备起来”。于是，他主张美国需要“找寻一种强心剂”，“以使这个精神萎靡的组织恢复生气”。正是出于这样的要求，咨文的起草人洋洋得意地赞扬针对爱好自由的各国人民的军事联盟和集团的体系，并且提出今后要加强它，要保持“威慑性军事力量”和仰仗“原子的威力”。
    结果，美国统治集团的好战计划又一次暴露无遗。美国“纽约时报”1月9日发表的汉密尔顿的文章说，这篇国情咨文中“一点也没有提到禁止或者限制使用核子武器”。但他更着重指出，“由于宣布华盛顿不再支持美国在裁军问题最初七、八年的谈判中提出过或者接受过的任何建议，美国的地位被削弱了”。汉密尔顿还说，美国对裁军问题的态度将会使“欧洲中立主义”继续“增长”，这正是“美国面临最困难的外交问题之一”。应该说，这样的估计是合乎客观现实的。
    1955年美国“实力地位”政策失败的另一个原因，正如“华盛顿邮报”的社论所说的，是由于万隆会议而产生的“要求独立的动力在反抗东南亚组织等军事条约中出现了”。“在联合国，也可以看到同样的影响。美国在联合国的声望已经在走下坡路”。而苏联领袖访问印度、缅甸、阿富汗所产生的巨大影响，更加使得美国统治集团惊惶不安。刚从印度等地旅行归来的共和党参议员拉尔夫·弗兰德斯也承认，“数以百万计的印度人都深信俄国人是‘人类的热爱者和世界的救星’。”长时期遭受殖民主义者欺侮和压迫的亚非人民的日益觉醒和决心把自己的命运掌握在自己手里，没有疑问，这对殖民主义者和企图在这个地区挑起新战争的帝国主义分子是一个沉重打击。当然，他们对于自己的失败是并不甘心的。
    咨文的起草人这次强调要扩大对外“援助”，并特别提出增加对亚洲的“援助”，作为对外政策的中心，正说明了这一点。
    美国的对外“援助”并不是什么新东西。这次大谈对外“援助”的真正企图，真像中国一句俗话说得好，“司马昭之心，路人皆知”。根据“印度报业托辣斯”1月5日纽约电讯的报道，由于这篇咨文提到美国的对外“援助”是为了帮助“维护它们的自由反对共产主义的压迫和颠复的威胁而斗争的国家”，因而使联合国代表们也感到“失望”，因为这“就使‘冷战’心理和对待国际问题的‘冷战’态度继续存在下去”。
    法国“国际论坛”周刊透露，所谓美国增加对外“援助”的内容，“根据国务院的规划，军事援助将从10.22亿美元增加为32.4亿美元。至于经济援助，预计的增加额就少得多，即从16.81亿美元增加为19.06亿美元。不管什么样名义的美国对外“援助”，实质上是殖民主义者奴役别国人民的新形式。“纽约邮报”记者拉希报道，联合国万隆会议国家人士对这篇咨文特别注意到的一点，就是“咨文中一点也没有谈到亚洲和非洲的殖民主义”，“印度报业托辣斯”的一个电讯说，这是这篇咨文中“最重要的方面”。这是非常有趣的。任凭美国怎样用对外“援助”把自己打扮成像个“慈善家”，但殖民主义者的原形终究是掩藏不了的。
    这篇咨文表明，咨文的起草人依然主张实行“实力地位”政策。这种政策早已遭到世界舆论的谴责。事实将会证明，这种政策不会使美国摆脱外交政策上的死胡同，也不会改善它的国际地位。相反，一定会使美国在外交上更加孤立，使它的政策同各国人民的愿望发生更加尖锐的冲突。
