    Supplying Agriculture with a Large Number of New-Style Farm Tools
    The state-owned Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory plans to produce 120,000 double-wheeled double-furrow plows and other new-style farm tools this year, as well as a small batch of Stalin No. 6 combine harvesters. In order to accomplish this huge production task, all the factory's employees are actively carrying out labor competitions, striving to complete and overfulfill the state plan ahead of schedule, and to support the agricultural cooperation movement.

    Worker Wang Changpei (right, Beijing Municipal Model Worker) and Liu Yintang are working on modifying the pliers jaws.
    Chief Engineer Li Kezuo (second from the right) and engineering technicians successfully created a guard for the soybean harvesting device. Here, they are studying the effect of the trial-produced product.
    Shi Juncai (right, Beijing Municipal Model Worker), the leader of the plowshare group in the foundry workshop, is casting plowshares.
    The workshop wall newspaper frequently publishes news of new records set by various workshops, encouraging the workers' enthusiasm for labor.
    Workers participate in spare-time studies, improving their cultural, scientific, and technical levels. The picture shows workers studying mathematics.
    The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory has successfully trial-produced three Stalin No. 6 combine harvesters and will begin small-batch production this year. Representatives from the Agricultural New Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing spoke at the factory's New Year's celebration, thanking the workers for producing new-style farm tools to support agricultural cooperation.
