Xinhua News Agency, 18th - The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued the following statement on January 18th:

The Sino-US ambassadorial talks have been unable to reach any agreement on the second item on the agenda in the more than 4 months since the agreement was reached on the issue of the repatriation of civilians on both sides on September 10, 1955. The two issues raised by the Chinese side, namely, the lifting of the embargo and the preparation for a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting to discuss easing and eliminating tensions in the Taiwan area, have not yet entered substantive discussion. The US side has raised the so-called issue of renouncing the use of force, but is unwilling to reach an agreement on this issue that is acceptable to both sides. Moreover, recently the United States has intensified its military activities in the Taiwan area to create tension, and US Secretary of State Dulles has even reiterated his clamor for atomic war against China. Under these circumstances, the Chinese government believes that it is necessary to announce the course of the Sino-US talks and explain China's position.

I. After the Sino-US talks reached an agreement on the issue of the repatriation of civilians on both sides, our side immediately proposed the "embargo issue" and the "issue of preparing for higher-level Sino-US negotiations" as two items on the second agenda. However, the US side refused to conduct any substantive discussion on these two issues. It was not until October 8th that the US side proposed that the Sino-US sides should first issue a statement renouncing the use of force.

If the so-called issue of renouncing the use of force means that the Sino-US countries should, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, peacefully resolve disputes between the two countries without resorting to force, then this is precisely what China has consistently advocated. The suggestion made by China in Bandung that the Sino-US countries should sit down for negotiations was to realize the proposition of non-use of force in international relations. China's proposal in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks to hold higher-level Sino-US negotiations is also to realize this proposition. However, the issue of non-use of force in the international relations between China and the United States must not be confused with the domestic issues of either of the two countries. As far as the Taiwan issue is concerned, the US occupation of China's territory Taiwan is an international dispute between China and the United States; the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory Taiwan is China's sovereignty and internal affair. Although the Chinese government has repeatedly stated that it is willing, under possible conditions, to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, this issue of China's internal affairs can never become the subject of Sino-US talks.

II. After the Chinese side clarified the above position in the talks, it proposed a draft agreement statement between the Sino-US ambassadors on October 27 regarding the issue of renouncing the use of force raised by the US side. The full text is as follows:

"Ambassador Wang Bingnan, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Ambassador Johnson, on behalf of the Government of the United States of America, jointly declare:

In accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the United Nations Charter, 'All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered';

And in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the United Nations Charter, 'All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations';

The People's Republic of China and the United States of America agree that they should resolve disputes between them by peaceful means without resorting to threats or force;

In order to realize their common aspirations, the People's Republic of China and the United States of America decide to hold a meeting of foreign ministers to discuss solutions to ease and eliminate tensions in the Taiwan area."

If both sides are sincere, then there should be no difficulty in reaching an agreement based on this draft statement proposed by the Chinese side. The United States is a member of the United Nations, and it should not have any objection to the explicit provisions of the United Nations Charter. The United States has used force and threats against China in the Taiwan area, creating tensions in the Taiwan area; in order to realize the principle of non-use of force stipulated by the United Nations Charter in Sino-US relations, it is obvious that only through the channel of a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting is it possible to resolve and ease the elimination of tensions in the Taiwan area.

III. However, during the talks, the US side stated that it was unwilling to specifically mention specific clauses of the United Nations Charter in the statement, nor was it willing to clearly stipulate that a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting should be held. It was not until November 10th, exactly two months after the two sides reached an agreement on the first item on the agenda, that the US side first specifically proposed its own draft statement on renouncing the use of force. The main content of the draft statement proposed by the US side is:

"Ambassador Johnson, on behalf of the United States of America, notifies Ambassador Wang Bingnan as follows:

Generally speaking, and especially with regard to the Taiwan area, the United States of America renounces the use of force except for individual and collective defense.

Ambassador Wang Bingnan, on behalf of the People's Republic of China, notifies Ambassador Johnson as follows:

Generally speaking, and especially with regard to the Taiwan area, the People's Republic of China renounces the use of force except for individual and collective defense."

As the Chinese side pointed out in the talks, the draft statement proposed by the US side is essentially an attempt to confuse the international disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan area with the domestic issues between the Chinese government and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, demanding that China recognize the status quo of the US occupation of China's territory Taiwan and abandon the sovereignty of liberating Taiwan; this is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese side. Taiwan is China's territory, and for the United States, the issue of defense simply does not arise. Since the United States has already used force and threats against China in the Taiwan area, if defense is mentioned, it is precisely China that should use its right of defense to expel such force and threats. However, the United States, on the contrary, demands that it have the right to defense in the Taiwan area. Doesn't this mean demanding that China recognize the long-term occupation of Taiwan by the United States and perpetually maintain the tense situation in the Taiwan area?

IV. Even so, in order to enable the talks to make progress step by step, the Chinese side made another effort and proposed the following new draft on December 1st:

"Ambassador Wang Bingnan, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Ambassador Johnson, on behalf of the Government of the United States of America, agree to declare:

The People's Republic of China and the United States of America express their determination that they should resolve disputes between them through peaceful negotiations without resorting to threats or force;

The two ambassadors should continue talks to seek practical and feasible ways to realize this common aspiration."

The Chinese side believes that only a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting is a practical and feasible way to resolve disputes between the Sino-US countries, especially serious issues such as the tense situation in the Taiwan area. However, in order to promote the progress of the talks, the Chinese side agreed to first issue the above statement, and then the two ambassadors would specifically discuss the issue of holding a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting. At the same time, it should be pointed out that, given that the United States has already used force and threats against China in the Taiwan area, if the Sino-US ambassadorial talks cannot reach an agreement on holding a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting, then the aspirations in the above statement will not be realized.

It can be seen from this that if the US government is truly sincere in renouncing the use of force and threats, it has no reason to continue to delay the talks and not reach an agreement on our new draft.

V. However, the US side refused to make any specific comments in the three consecutive meetings after our side put forward this new draft, neither expressing opposition nor agreement. It was not until January 12, 1956, that the US side proposed a counter-proposal, the full text of which is as follows:

"Ambassador Johnson, on behalf of the Government of the United States of America, and Ambassador Wang Bingnan, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, agree to declare:

The United States of America and the People's Republic of China express their determination that they will resolve disputes between them by peaceful means, and that they will not resort in the Taiwan area or elsewhere to the threat or use of force without prejudice to the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense;

The two ambassadors should continue talks to seek practical and feasible ways to realize this common aspiration."

Obviously, this counter-proposal of the US side is essentially no different from the US draft statement of November 10, which had already been resolutely rejected by the Chinese side. The US side continues to demand that our side recognize that the United States has the "inherent right of individual and collective self-defense" in our Taiwan area, which our side absolutely cannot agree to.

VI. Since September 10th, the US side has, on the one hand, delayed discussion on the second item on the agenda, refused to reach an agreement acceptable to both sides on the so-called issue of renouncing the use of force, and on the other hand, constantly entangled itself in the issue of the implementation of the agreement on the first item on the agenda. In fact, it is the US side itself that is violating the agreement on the first item on the agenda. According to the agreement, the United States has the obligation to take measures to enable Chinese in the United States to exercise their right to return as soon as possible. However, the US side has not yet provided our side with the full list and information of Chinese expatriates and students in the United States, making it difficult for India to carry out the third-country mission stipulated in the agreement. Recently, the US government has also stipulated that Chinese in the United States must obtain Taiwan entry permits, openly depriving them of their right to return to their country in the future. There are tens of thousands of Chinese expatriates in the United States, and due to the US side's violation of the agreement and continued obstruction and threats, the vast majority of them have not been able to or dare to apply to return to their country. As for the Americans in China, there were originally few in number. During the Sino-US talks, among the 59 law-abiding American expatriates, 16 who requested to leave the country had already been approved, and even among the 40 law-breaking Americans, 27 had already been released early due to the lenient policy adopted by the Chinese government. Given this situation, the US side continues to make unfounded accusations in the talks, the purpose of which can only be considered an attempt to evade its own responsibility for violating the agreement and to create excuses for delaying the talks.

VII. The tense situation in the Taiwan area is a key issue between China and the United States, and the root cause of the tense situation is the US armed occupation of Chinese territory. Even so, the Chinese side still advocates resolving this dispute between China and the United States through negotiations, and has been working hard in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks to seek practical and feasible ways to realize this proposition. However, the US side deliberately delays the Sino-US talks, refuses to reach an agreement on ways to ease and eliminate the tense situation in the Taiwan area, and instead demands that China recognize the status quo of the US armed occupation of Taiwan. At the same time, US Secretary of State Dulles recently publicly clamored that in order to occupy Chinese territory and infringe upon Chinese sovereignty, he would not hesitate to provoke an atomic war. The American aggressors think that this can scare the Chinese people and force China to give up its sovereignty, which is absolutely impossible. For several years, the armistice in Korea, the restoration of peace in Indochina, and the withdrawal from Dachen Island have all repeatedly demonstrated the power of the world's people who demand peace and uphold justice, and declared the bankruptcy of the policy of strength and the policy of atomic intimidation. If the American aggressors still want to continue to implement this policy of atomic intimidation, they will inevitably suffer even greater and more tragic failures.

The Chinese government believes that the Sino-US talks should seek practical and feasible ways to ease and eliminate the tense situation in the Taiwan area. The Chinese side has put forward reasonable suggestions that are completely acceptable to both sides. The Sino-US talks should quickly reach an agreement based on these reasonable suggestions, and then resolve the issue of lifting the embargo and preparing for a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting. Delay and intimidation cannot solve any problems.

### 中华人民共和国外交部发言人发表声明  公布中美会谈的经过并说明中国方面的立场

    中华人民共和国外交部发言人发表声明
    公布中美会谈的经过并说明中国方面的立场
    新华社18日讯　中华人民共和国外交部发言人1月18日发表声明如下：
    中美大使级会谈自从1955年9月10日对双方平民回国问题达成协议以来，在4个多月的时间内一直没有能够对第二项议程取得任何协议。中国方面所提出的取消禁运和准备中美外长会议来讨论和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势的两项议题，至今还没有进入实质性的讨论。美国方面提出了所谓放弃使用武力的问题，但是又不愿对这个问题达成双方都能同意的协议。不仅如此，最近美国还加紧了在台湾地区制造紧张局势的军事活动，美国国务卿杜勒斯甚至重行叫嚣对中国进行原子战争。在这种情况下，中国政府认为有必要公布中美会谈的经过，说明中国方面的立场。
    一、在中美会谈对双方平民回国问题达成协议后，我方就立即提出“禁运问题”和“准备更高一级的中美谈判问题”，作为第二项议程的两项议题。但是，美方拒绝对这两项议题进行任何实质性的讨论。直到10月8日，美方才提出中美双方应该首先发表放弃使用武力的声明。
    如果说，所谓放弃使用武力的问题就是中美两国应该根据联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，和平解决两国之间的争端而不诉诸武力，那么，这正是中国所一贯主张的。中国在万隆提出的中美两国应该坐下来谈判的建议，就是为了实现在国际关系中不使用武力的主张。中国在中美大使级会谈中提出举行更高一级的中美谈判的建议，也正是为了实现这个主张。但是，在中美两国的国际关系中不使用武力的问题，绝对不能同中美两国中任何一国的国内问题混为一谈。就台湾问题来说，美国侵占中国的领土台湾是中美两国之间的国际争端；中国人民解放自己的领土台湾，这是中国的主权和内政。虽然中国政府曾经一再声明，愿意在可能的条件下，争取用和平的方式解放台湾，但是，这个中国内政的问题，决不可能成为中美会谈的题目。
    二、中国方面在会谈中阐明了上述立场以后，在10月27日就美方提出的放弃使用武力的问题提出了中美两国大使协议声明的草案。它的全文如下：
    “王炳南大使代表中华人民共和国政府、约翰逊大使代表美利坚合众国政府共同声明：
    根据联合国宪章第二条第三款，‘各会员国应以和平方法解决其国际争端，俾免危及国际和平、安全及正义’；
    并且根据联合国宪章第二条第四款，‘各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立’；
    中华人民共和国和美利坚合众国同意，它们应该用和平方法解决它们两国之间的争端而不诉诸威胁或武力；
    为了实现它们的共同愿望，中华人民共和国和美利坚合众国决定举行外长会议，协商解决和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势的问题。”
    如果双方都具有诚意的话，那么，根据中国方面提出的这一声明草案达成协议是不应该有任何困难的。美国是联合国的一个会员国，它对于联合国宪章的明文规定不应该有任何反对。美国在台湾地区对中国使用了武力和威胁，造成了台湾地区的紧张局势；为了在中美关系中实现联合国宪章所规定的不使用武力的原则，显然只有通过中美外长会议的途径，才有可能解决和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势的问题。
    三、但是，在会谈过程中，美方却表示不愿意在声明里具体提到联合国宪章的特定条款，也不愿意明确规定举行中美外长会议。一直到11月10日，双方对第一项议程达成协议的整整两个月后，美方才第一次具体提出了它自己的关于放弃使用武力的声明草案。美方提出的声明草案的主要内容是：
    “约翰逊大使代表美利坚合众国通知王炳南大使如下：
    一般来说，并特别对于台湾地区来说，除了单独和集体的防御外，美利坚合众国放弃使用武力。
    王炳南大使代表中华人民共和国通知约翰逊大使如下：
    一般来说，并特别对于台湾地区来说，除了单独和集体的防御外，中华人民共和国放弃使用武力。”
    正如中国方面在会谈中所指出的，美方提出的声明草案实质上就是企图混淆中美两国在台湾地区的国际争端同中国政府和蒋介石集团之间的国内问题，要求中国承认美国侵占中国领土台湾的现状，放弃解放台湾的主权；这是中国方面绝对不能接受的，台湾是中国的领土，对于美国来说，根本不发生防御的问题。由于美国在台湾地区已经对中国使用了武力和威胁，如果谈到防御的话，正是中国应该使用它的防御权利来驱除这种武力和威胁。但是，美国反而要求它在台湾地区有防御的权利，难道这不就是要求中国承认美国长期霸占台湾，永远保持台湾地区的紧张局势吗？
    四、虽然如此，为了使会谈能够有步骤地取得进展，中国方面作了又一次的努力，在12月1日提出如下的新的草案：
    “王炳南大使代表中华人民共和国政府、约翰逊大使代表美利坚合众国政府协议声明：
    中华人民共和国和美利坚合众国表示决心，它们应该通过和平谈判解决它们两国之间的争端而不诉诸威胁或武力；
    两国大使应该继续会谈，寻求实现这一共同愿望的切实可行的途径。”
    中国方面认为，只有中美外长会议才是解决中美两国之间的争端的切实可行的途径，特别是像台湾地区紧张局势这样严重的问题。但是，为了促使会谈的进展，中国方面同意先发表上述的声明，然后再由双方大使具体商定举行中美外长会议的问题。同时，应该指出，鉴于美国已经在台湾地区对中国使用了武力和威胁，如果中美大使级会谈不能就举行中美外长会议达成协议，那么，上述声明中的愿望也将无从实现。
    由此可见，美国政府如果真正具有放弃使用武力和威胁的诚意，它就没有任何理由再继续拖延会谈，而不就我方新草案达成协议。
    五、可是，美方却在我方提出这一新草案以后的接连三次会议上拒绝作任何具体的评论，既不表示反对，也不表示同意。一直到1956年1月12日，美方才提出一个对案，全文如下：
    “约翰逊大使代表美利坚合众国政府、王炳南大使代表中华人民共和国政府协议声明：
    美利坚合众国和中华人民共和国表示决心，它们将通过和平方法解决它们之间的争端，并且它们将在不损害单独和集体的自卫的固有权利的情况下，不在台湾地区或其他地方诉诸威胁或武力；
    两国大使应该继续会谈，寻求实现这一共同愿望的切实可行的途径。”
    显然，美方的这一对案，在实质上同早已为中国方面所坚决拒绝的11月10日的美方声明草案没有任何差别。美方继续要求我方承认美国在我国台湾地区有“单独和集体的自卫的固有权利”，这是我方绝对不能同意的。
    六、自从9月10日以来，美方一方面拖延对第二项议程的讨论，拒绝对所谓放弃使用武力的问题达成双方都能接受的协议，另一方面又不断对第一项议程协议的执行问题进行纠缠。事实上，违反第一项议程协议的正是美方自己。根据协议，美国有义务采取措施，使在美国的中国人能够尽速行使返回的权利。但是，美方至今没有向我方提供在美国的中国侨民和留学生的全部名单和情况，使印度难于执行协议中所规定的第三国任务。最近，美国政府还规定在美国的中国人必须取得台湾的入境证，公然剥夺他们在将来回国的权利。中国在美国的侨民有几万人，由于美方违反协议，继续进行阻挠和威胁，使他们当中的绝大多数人至今不能或不敢申请回国。至于在中国的美国人，他们本来就为数不多。在中美会谈期间，59名守法的美侨中，16名要求离境者都已经得到了批准，就是在40名犯法的美国人中，也已经由于中国政府所采取的宽大政策，提前释放了27人。情况如此，美国方面仍然在会谈中不断提出毫无根据的指摘，其目的只能被认为是企图逃避自己违反协议的责任，并且为拖延会谈制造借口。
    七、台湾地区的紧张局势是中美之间的关键问题，而紧张局势的根源是由于美国武装侵占中国领土造成的。虽然如此，中国方面仍然主张通过谈判来解决中美之间的这一争端，并且在中美大使级的会谈中一直为寻求实现这一主张的切实可行的途径而努力。但是，美国方面却蓄意拖延中美会谈，拒绝对和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势的途径达成协议，并且反而要求中国承认美国武装侵占台湾的现状。同时，美国国务卿杜勒斯最近又公开叫嚣，为霸占中国领土和侵犯中国主权，将不惜挑起原子战争。美国侵略者以为这样就可以吓倒中国人民，迫使中国放弃自己的主权，那是绝对办不到的。几年以来，朝鲜的停战、印度支那和平的恢复和大陈岛的撤退，都一再显示了要求和平和主持正义的世界人民的力量，宣布了实力政策和原子恐吓政策的破产。美国侵略者如果还想把这种原子恐吓政策继续推行下去，它将必然得到更大更惨的失败。
    中国政府认为中美会谈应该为和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势寻求切实可行的途径。中国方面已经提出了完全可为双方接受的合理建议，中美会谈应该根据这一合理建议迅速达成协议，并且进而解决取消禁运和准备中美外长会议的问题。拖延和恐吓是不能解决任何问题的。
