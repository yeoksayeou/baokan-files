Some Experiences in Uniting and Transforming Secondary School Teachers
Tang Zhuang, Secretary of the CPC Branch of Yangzhou Normal School

In the past few years, the Party organization of Yangzhou Normal School, after studying the Party's policy on uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, and through continuous inspection of work and correction of shortcomings, has initially explored some experiences that have made us more clearly aware that only by earnestly doing this work can the school's Party organization guarantee the smooth development of the school's teaching work.

First of all, attention should be paid to caring about the teachers' progress politically, helping and improving them. Teachers have a certain level of cultural and scientific knowledge and technical skills, a considerable understanding and acceptance ability, and an interest in learning theory. In the early days of liberation, many teachers enthusiastically requested to study Marxist-Leninist theory, and the Party organization led these teachers to study the history of social development and other theoretical books. Through study, these teachers initially understood the principle that labor creates the world and initially understood the basic laws of social development. Later, after a series of political movements such as the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, especially after studying the Party's general line during the transition period, the teachers' awareness improved, they were able to see the bright socialist prospects, and their enthusiasm for work greatly increased. All 42 teachers in the school began to conscientiously prepare lesson plans and arrange teaching time. History teacher Li Zhongyu compiled four thick volumes of lesson notes totaling 320 pages in one semester.

Willingness to study theory is a good side of teachers, but the separation of theory and practice is a bad side of some teachers. Therefore, these teachers should be encouraged and organized to transform themselves in practice. Yangzhou Normal School has organized all teachers to participate in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and to visit the Phoenix River estuary project, state-owned farms, and the Golden Agricultural Production Cooperative. In last year's struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, more than 20 activists emerged in the school, including three teachers who have been promoted to heads of teaching and research groups.

In 1955, when studying Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," the Party organization also organized teachers to visit state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives. After returning, we studied Comrade Mao Zedong's report again. In this way, everyone understood it more deeply.

In order to meet the progressive demands of the vast majority of teachers in the school, the Party organization held lectures on basic knowledge of communism and educated teachers who voluntarily requested to attend on the eight issues of Party membership standards. The Party organization also held individual talks with teachers applying to join the Party, specifically pointing out their advantages, disadvantages, and directions for their efforts, and admitted two teachers who met the conditions into the Party. The Party organization verbally praised and materially rewarded teachers who had made significant achievements in political study.

The Party organization should not only care about the teachers' political life, but also care about their daily life. Deputy Director of Teaching Affairs Chen Dazuo encountered difficulties in his life due to the death of his wife, and the Party organization and the administrative side provided assistance to solve Chen Dazuo's difficulties. Afterwards, Chen Dazuo said excitedly: "The Party cadres of the school care about me too much." The Party organization also instructed the trade union to help teachers collectively purchase items such as tangerines, apples, and fresh fish. In this way, the teachers felt that working at the school was warm, and that the Party organization and administrative leaders took care of them in every possible way. They became more closely united around the Party organization.

Since 1954, the Party organization has also cultivated a spirit of criticism and self-criticism among teachers. The method is for leading cadres to take the lead in self-criticism. During the semester and at the end of the semester, the principal conducted self-criticism on the leadership work during this period and called on everyone to criticize the leadership work. This set a good example for the teachers. Later, the Party organization suggested establishing a monthly work and study reporting meeting, where teachers could report on their work and study in a spirit of self-criticism, and also criticize other teachers and the school's work.

In order to unite the teachers more closely, the Party organization and Party members often humbly listened to the teachers' opinions. For example, Director of Teaching Affairs Zhu Yifan (Party member) and Deputy Director of Teaching Affairs Chen Dazuo often discussed problems together, which made Chen feel that the Party organization trusted him, so he worked actively and made rapid progress.

    团结和改造中等学校教师的几点体会
    中共扬州师范学校支部书记　唐桩
    几年来，扬州师范学校党组织，在学习了党关于团结、教育和改造知识分子的政策后，在不断检查工作和改正缺点当中，初步摸索到一些经验，使我们更明确地认识到，学校党组织只有认真做好这一工作，才能保证学校的教学工作很好的开展。
    首先应该注意在政治上关心教师们的进步，帮助和提高他们。教师们都有一定的文化科学知识和技术水平，有相当的理解力和接受力，有兴趣学习理论。解放初期，许多教师热烈地要求学习马克思列宁主义理论，党组织就领导这些教师学习了社会发展史及其他理论书籍。通过学习，使这些教师初步懂得了劳动创造世界的道理，初步了解了社会发展的基本规律。以后，又经过了抗美援朝、“三反”、“五反”等一系列政治运动，特别是经过了党在过渡时期总路线的学习，教师们的觉悟提高了，能够看到光明灿烂的社会主义的远景了，工作积极性大大地提高了。全校42个教师都开始认真地编写备课提纲和安排教学时间。历史教师李钟毓一学期中就编写了四厚本共320页的备课笔记。
    愿意学习理论是教师们好的一面，但理论和实践分家又是一些教师们不好的一面。因此，应当鼓励和组织这些教师在实践中改造自己。扬州师范曾组织了全体教师参加“三反”、“五反”、镇压反革命分子等运动，参观了凤凰河入江水道工程，参观了国营农场、黄金农业生产合作社。在去年的肃反斗争中，校内出现了二十几个积极分子，其中有三位教师已提拔为教研组组长。
    1955年，学习毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”报告的时候，党组织又组织教师们参观了国营农场、农业生产合作社。回来后，再学习毛泽东同志的报告。这样，大家就领会得比较深刻。
    为了满足校内绝大部分教师的进步要求，党组织举办了共产主义基本知识讲座，对自愿要求听讲的教师进行了党员标准八个问题的教育。党组织还对申请入党的教师进行了个别谈话，具体地指出他们的优点、缺点和努力方向，并吸收了两个条件成熟的教师入党。对政治学习有显著成绩的教师，党组织分别进行了口头表扬和物质奖励。
    党组织既要关心教师们的政治生活，也要关心他们的日常生活。副教导主任陈达祚因妻子病死，生活方面有了困难，党组织和行政方面就给予帮助，解决了陈达祚的困难。事后陈达祚激动地说：“学校党的干部太关心我了”。党组织还指示工会帮助教师集体采购蜜桔、苹果、鲜鱼等物品。这样，教师们感到在学校工作是温暖的，党组织和行政领导上对他们的照顾是无微不至的。他们就更紧密地团结在党组织的周围。
    从1954年起，党组织还在教师中培养批评和自我批评的风气。办法是领导干部带头进行自我批评。在学期中和学期末，由校长对这一时期的领导工作进行自我批评，并号召大家对领导工作提出批评。这就在教师中树立了良好的榜样。以后，党组织建议建立月终工作学习汇报会议，教师们都能以自我批评的精神汇报工作学习情况，还对其他教师和学校的工作提出批评。
    为了更紧密地团结教师，党组织和党员经常虚心地听取教师们的意见。如教导主任朱一帆（党员）和副教导主任陈达祚经常在一起商量问题，使陈感到党组织对他的信任，因而积极工作，进步很快。
