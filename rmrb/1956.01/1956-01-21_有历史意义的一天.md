A Historically Significant Day
Shaanxi Daily Reporter

These days, the city of Xi'an has been immersed in a sea of joy.

Just after the New Year, under the call of the Party's policies, private industrialists and businessmen and handicraftsmen in Xi'an applied for joint state-private ownership or full cooperativization, one group after another. Some capitalists, in order to strive for the early joint state-private ownership of their enterprises, voluntarily carried out asset inventory and verification work in advance. Some capitalists took out off-the-books property and invested it in joint state-private enterprises as a gift to socialism. After hearing the news of the full cooperativization of the tea industry, Liu Jikun, manager of Tianchengfu Tea House, voluntarily took out three silver ingots, totaling 179 taels, as an investment in the new enterprise. Some people took the initiative to participate in the production labor in the enterprises in order to welcome the new life after joint state-private ownership. In addition to welcoming joint state-private ownership with new production achievements, the broad masses of employees and shop assistants formed more than 370 private enterprise youth shock teams with more than 1,800 people. They assisted the government in accelerating the transformation work and catching up with the workers in the capital.

In order to meet the people's demands for progress, the Party Committee and the People's Committee revised the plan for the transformation work. On January 13th and 14th, the last batch of private industry, commerce, and handicrafts in the city implemented full joint state-private ownership and cooperativization.

On the 15th, more than 100,000 employees, shop assistants, handicraft laborers, capitalists and their families from private enterprises in Xi'an held a grand rally and parade.

They carried huge statues of Chairman Mao, held countless red banners with the words "Celebrating the Joint State-Private Ownership of Private Industry and Commerce in the City" and "Celebrating the Cooperativization of Handicrafts in the City," golden large "?" characters, various guarantees, and slogan boards with "Marching towards Socialism." Beating waist drums, stepping on stilts, and performing Yangko dances, they advanced in a mighty procession.

Many employees greeted the first day after joint state-private ownership with new production achievements. The workers of Tianshengyuan Food Processing Factory, Xu Jinling Foundry, and Daxing Electric Saw Factory increased their output by 10%-80% in one day on the 14th compared to normal. Ye Zheng'an and other five members of the Beilin District First Transportation Tool Production Cooperative worked overnight before the parade to rush out four pairs of large manure buckets for the agricultural cooperative, and participated in the parade with excitement the next day. Li Yixuan, the manager of Taihe Department Store, who was not in good health, participated in the parade with crutches in order to celebrate this joyous day. Thousands of family members of industrialists and businessmen, rejoicing that their loved ones had chosen the bright and happy road, came to participate in the parade in festive costumes. In the parade, voices of "Long live Chairman Mao," "Long live the Chinese Communist Party," and "Long live socialism" erupted from time to time. On this day, cadres of organs, young students, citizens, and family women came to congratulate, and suburban farmers who participated in agricultural cooperatives also rushed to congratulate. The people of Xi'an celebrated this historically significant day with unparalleled excitement. (Attached picture)

    有历史意义的一天
    陕西日报记者
    这些天来，西安市一直沉浸在欢乐的海洋里。
    新年刚过，西安市私营工商业者和手工业者就在党的政策感召下，一批接着一批地申请全行业公私合营或全行业合作化。有的资本家为了争取企业早日公私合营，自动地事先进行清产核资工作。有的资本家拿出帐外财产投入公私合营企业，作为对社会主义的献礼。天成福茶庄经理刘继琨听到茶叶业全行业合营的消息以后，自动拿出3个银元宝，共计179两，作为对新企业的投资。有的人为了迎接公私合营以后的新生活，主动参加了企业里的生产劳动。广大的职工店员们除了以新的生产成就迎接公私合营外，还组成了1，800多人的370多个私营企业青年职工突击队。协助政府加速进行改造工作，向首都的工人看齐。
    党委和人民委员会为了满足人们前进的要求，修订了改造工作的规划。1月13、14两日，全市最后一批私营工商业和手工业实行了全行业公私合营和合作化。
    15日这天，西安市10万多私营企业的职工、店员、手工业劳动者、资本家和他们的家属举行了盛大的集会游行。
    他们抬着毛主席的巨像，高举着数不清的“庆祝全市私营工商业公私合营”“庆祝全市手工业合作化”的红布横幅、金色的大“?”字、各式各样的保证书和“向社会主义进军”的标语牌，打着腰鼓、踩着高蹻、扭着秧歌，浩浩荡荡地前进。
    不少职工以新的生产成就迎接了公私合营以后的第一天。天生园食品加工厂、徐金龄翻砂厂、大兴电锯厂的工人们，在14日一天内，产量比平时提高了10％—80％。碑林区第一交通用具生产社社员叶郑安等5人，在游行的前一天连夜给农业合作社赶制了4对大粪桶，第二天又怀着兴奋的心情参加了游行。身体不太好的泰和百货店的经理李益轩，为了欢庆这个大喜日，拄着拐杖参加了游行行列。一千数百名工商业者的家属，庆幸她们的亲人选择了光明幸福的大道，都穿着节日盛装来参加游行。在游行队伍当中，不时爆发出“毛主席万岁”、“中国共产党万岁”和“社会主义万岁”的声音。这一天，前来参加贺喜的还有机关干部、青年学生、市民和家属妇女，参加了农业社的郊区农民也赶来贺喜。全西安市的人民都以无比兴奋的心情度过这有历史意义的一天。（附图片）
