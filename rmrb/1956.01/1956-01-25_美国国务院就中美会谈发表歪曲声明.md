Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 24th: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on January 21st regarding the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Geneva, distorting the course of the talks and the substance of the discussions, and defending the U.S. attitude of insisting on unreasonable demands and delaying the talks.

The first part of the statement concerns the agreement between China and the United States on the repatriation of civilians. After describing the content of the agreement, the statement falsely accuses the Chinese side of violating the agreement, while denying the U.S. side's actions of arbitrarily violating the agreement. The statement says: "To this day, ... 13 Americans are still in Communist prisons.
As for the United States, any Chinese is free to leave the United States to go wherever he wants, and no one has been refused permission to leave. The Indian Embassy, designated to assist any Chinese who wish to leave, has not brought to the attention of the U.S. government any cases in which Chinese believe their departure has been hindered; nor has it said that it has been hindered in carrying out its mission in accordance with the provisions of the September 10 agreement.”

The second part of the statement concerns the discussion on the issue of renouncing the use of force in the Sino-U.S. talks. The statement describes the course of the discussion on this issue, the proposals put forward by the U.S. side, and the proposals put forward by the Chinese side. When talking about the new proposal put forward by the Chinese side on December 1, 1955, the statement distorts the attitude of the Chinese side, insisting that this new proposal indicates that China "has abandoned holding a foreign ministers' meeting."

After mentioning the statement made by the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 18 regarding the Sino-U.S. talks, the statement then explains the unreasonable attitude embodied in the U.S. proposal. The statement says, "The United States' attitude is: First, the United States is not occupying Taiwan, and Taiwan has never been part of Communist China. Communist China's claims to the region and the United States' dispute over the region are well known and constitute a major dispute between them. Specifically, in this dispute the United States has suggested the principle of renouncing the use of force and resolving differences through peaceful means. This is a principle that the Communists say they have accepted.
In this regard, the United States has made it perfectly clear that neither side will give up its goals and policies by renouncing the use of force, but only give up the use of force to achieve them.
Second, the United States has rights and responsibilities in the Taiwan area; and there is also a mutual defense treaty. Therefore, it remains in the Taiwan area, and the Communist refusal to say that renouncing the use of force does not prejudice the right to self-defense against armed attack, this refusal can only be interpreted as an attempt to induce the United States to agree that, in the event of an attack, it will abandon the right to defend its legitimate presence in the area.
The right to individual and collective self-defense against armed attack is inherent; it is recognized by international law; it is specifically affirmed in the Charter of the United Nations. No country can be expected to give up this right. In fact, the Communists should be as eager to uphold this right as the United States."

The final part of the statement is the so-called "conclusion." These conclusions show that the United States wants to stick to its unreasonable demands and delay the Sino-U.S. talks. These conclusions of the U.S. side are:

"1. Four months after the Communists announced that they would take measures to allow Americans in China to return to the United States, 13 Americans are still being held in Communist prisons.
2. The United States has suggested that both sides renounce the use of force without prejudice to the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense against armed attack, so that negotiations can proceed without the threat of war.
3. The United States has shown that this renunciation of the use of force will not prejudice either side from pursuing its goals and pursuing its policies by peaceful means.
4. Although the Communists recognize the principle of renouncing the use of force, they refuse to agree that this does not prejudice the right of individual and collective self-defense against armed attack and applies to the Taiwan area, thus rendering this recognition worthless.
In short, so far the Communists seem willing to renounce the use of force only if the goal they want to achieve by using force is recognized first.
The United States, on its side, intends to insist on peaceful means. We seek the Chinese Communists to fulfill their long overdue obligation to promptly allow Americans now in China to return home. We pursue this goal not only for humanitarian reasons but also out of respect for international obligations that form the basis of a stable international order, and we will steadfastly seek a meaningful renunciation of the use of force, especially in the Taiwan area."

Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: According to Reuters Washington news: On January 21st, U.S. State Department authorities, in explaining the U.S. State Department's statement on Sino-U.S. talks, said: The U.S. position on the Taiwan issue is non-negotiable and "non-negotiable." He stated that the United States is not prepared to give up Taiwan or the treaty it signed with Chiang Kai-shek, and will not use this as a price for reaching an agreement with the Communists.

He said that the U.S. military authorities believe that Taiwan is extremely important to the U.S. island defense chain.

This State Department official also said that the United States would not even consider arranging a possible foreign ministers' meeting until the ambassadors in Geneva have fully utilized the possibilities on their own agenda.

### 美国国务院就中美会谈发表歪曲声明

    美国国务院就中美会谈发表歪曲声明
    新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院1月21日发表关于中美两国大使级日内瓦会谈的声明，歪曲地叙述了会谈的经过和讨论的实质，而为美国坚持无理要求，拖延会谈的态度辩护。
    声明第一部分谈到中美会谈关于双方平民回国问题的协议。声明在叙述了协议的内容后，诬蔑中国方面违反协议，而抵赖美国方面恣意违反协议的行径。声明说：“到今天为止，……13个美国人还在共方监狱中。
    至于美国，任何中国人都可以自由离开美国去他要去的任何地方，没有一个人被拒绝准许出境。被指定协助任何愿意离境的中国人的印度大使馆并未提请美国政府注意中国人认为其离境受到了阻碍的任何案件；它也没有说它在根据9月10日的协议声明的规定执行它的任务时受到了任何阻碍。”
    声明第二部分谈到中美会谈关于放弃使用武力问题的讨论。声明叙述了关于这个问题讨论的经过，叙述了美国方面提出的建议和中国方面提出的建议。声明在谈到中国方面在1955年12月1日提出的新建议时，歪曲中国方面的态度，硬说这个新建议表明中国“放弃了举行外交部长级会谈”。
    声明在谈到中国外交部发言人1月18日关于中美会谈的声明以后，接着说明了美国体现在它的建议里的无理态度。声明说，“美国的态度是：第一、美国不是霸占台湾，台湾也从来不是共产党中国的一部分。共产党中国对这个地区的要求和美国关于这个地区的争论是熟为人知的，而且构成了它们之间的一个主要争执。特别是在这个争执方面美国建议了放弃使用武力和通过和平方法解决分歧的原则。这是共产党人说他们已经接受了的原则。
    在这方面，美国已经完全明晰地阐明，任何一方都不因放弃使用武力而放弃它的目标和政策，而只是放弃使用武力来实现它们。
    第二、美国在台湾地区有权利和责任；而且还有共同防御条约。因此，它留在台湾地区，共产党拒绝说放弃使用武力不损害进行自卫来对付武装进攻的权利，这种拒绝只能被解释为企图诱使美国同意，在一旦遭受攻击时，它将放弃保卫它在这个地区的合法存在的权利。
    进行单独和集体的自卫来对付武装进攻的权利是固有的；这是国际法所承认的；它特别在联合国宪章中得到了确认。不能期望任何国家放弃这种权利。事实上，共产党人应该像美国一样迫切希望维护这种权利。”
    声明的最后部分是所谓“结论”。这些结论表明美国要坚持它的无理主张，使中美会谈拖延不决。美国方面的这些结论是：
    “一、在共产党宣布他们将采取措施允许在中国的美国人回返美国之后四个月，仍然有13个美国人被拘在共产党监狱中。
    二、美国曾建议在不损害对武装攻击的单独和集体自卫的固有权利的情况下双方放弃使用武力，以便谈判可以在没有战争威胁的情况下进行。
    三、美国已经表明，这种放弃使用武力将不损害任何一方以和平办法追求它的目标和奉行它的政策。
    四、共产党虽然承认放弃使用武力的原则，但是却拒绝同意这是不损害对武装攻击的单独和集体自卫的权利和适用于台湾地区的，因而使这种承认失去了价值。
    总而言之，到目前为止共产党似乎只有在他们要使用武力达到的那个目标首先得到承认的情况下才愿意放弃使用武力。
    美国在它这一面，打算坚持用和平的办法。我们寻求中国共产党履行他们的早该履行的义务，就是迅速允许现在在中国的美国人回国。我们追求这个目的不仅是为了人道的理由并且也是因为尊重构成稳定的国际秩序基础的国际义务，我们将坚定地寻求一种有意义的放弃使用武力，特别是在台湾地区。”
    新华社24日讯　据路透社华盛顿消息：美国国务院权威人士1月21日在解释美国国务院关于中美会谈的声明的时候说：美国对台湾问题的立场是没有转圜余地的，并且是“不能谈判的”。他表示，美国不准备放弃台湾或者它同蒋介石签订的条约，并且不会以这作为同共产党取得协议的代价。
    他说，美国军事当局认为台湾对美国的岛屿防御锁链说来是极端重要的。
    这个国务院人士还说，在日内瓦的大使们充分利用他们自己的议程上的可能性以前，美国甚至连考虑安排一次可能的外交部长会议问题都不肯。
