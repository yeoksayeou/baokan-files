    What is the sentencing standard? To the editor:
    On October 31, 1953, a shocking incident occurred on the banks of the Mudanjiang River: a boy of about five years old was thrown into the river and drowned. After investigation, it was found that the boy was the son of Liu Yunzhao, the former section chief of the Jixi Mining Area Public Security Bureau in Heilongjiang Province, and the murderer was his own father, Liu Yunzhao.
    Why was Liu Yunzhao so cruel? It turned out that he had divorced his wife not long before, and he had custody of the child. Then, he got engaged to another female comrade, but concealed the fact that he had a child. When the wedding day approached, he committed such a heinous act to avoid making his bride unhappy.
    Editor, what punishment did such a criminal receive? The Jixi County People's Court only sentenced him to ten years in prison. In 1954, he even appealed the decision; after "studying" the case, the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Court surprisingly found the original sentence too heavy and changed it to seven years in prison.
    We want to ask the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Court: what sentencing standard did you use to handle this case?	      Tian Zhong, Jia Yi, Yi Lin

    这是什么量刑标准？编辑同志：
    1953年10月31日，在牡丹江边发生了一件骇人听闻的事情：一个五岁左右的男孩子被人扔到江里溺死了。经查明，这个男孩子是原黑龙江省鸡西矿区公安局科长刘云照的儿子，而凶手就是他的父亲刘云照。
    刘云照为什么这样狠心呢？原来，他在不久以前和妻子离了婚，孩子由他抚养；接着，他同另一位女同志订婚了，但是却隐瞒了自己有孩子的事。当新婚佳期到来的时候，他为了不使新娘感到不愉快，于是就下了这样的毒手。
    编辑同志，像这样一个罪犯，受到了怎样的惩处呢？鸡西县人民法院只判了他十年徒刑。1954年他还不服上诉；黑龙江省人民法院经过“研究”以后，竟认为原判太重，于是改判为七年徒刑。
    我们要质问黑龙江省人民法院：你们处理这个案件，是根据什么量刑标准啊？		      田中　贾一　易林
