    January 28 Speech by Marshal Nie Rongzhen, Observer of the People's Republic of China, at the Meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States
    Comrade Chairman, Comrade Delegates:
    Please allow me, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, to warmly congratulate the success of the meeting.
    The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed in Warsaw on May 14, 1955, convening this meeting of the Political Consultative Committee to exchange views and make corresponding decisions on the current international situation and future tasks is entirely necessary and timely. Without a doubt, these decisions are of great significance for maintaining peace and easing international tensions.
    Peace-loving countries and peoples cannot sit idly by and ignore the imperialist aggressive blocs intensifying their arms buildup, preparing for war, and attempting to impose their will through a so-called "position of strength" policy. In the interests of world peace and the security of the socialist camp, it is entirely necessary to further strengthen the Warsaw Treaty Organization and to strengthen the friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance between the contracting parties. In this regard, the decision of the German Democratic Republic to establish its own people's army and to participate in the armed forces of the Joint Command of the Warsaw Treaty member states is a significant event.
    As everyone knows, the German Democratic Republic is a peace-loving country and a bastion of peace, democracy, and progressive forces in Germany. It insists on resolving the German question in accordance with the interests of European security and the German people, so that Germany becomes a unified, peaceful, democratic, and independent country. However, the American aggressive bloc and its followers insist on arming West Germany, dragging West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and openly attempting to annex Democratic Germany with West Germany, so that the entire Germany participates in this aggressive organization. Under these circumstances, it is not only necessary but also urgently needed for the German Democratic Republic to do everything possible to safeguard national security and the achievements already made by the working people. The Government and people of the People's Republic of China fully support the German Democratic Republic in establishing a people's army and participating in the armed forces of the Joint Command, and believe that this not only conforms to the interests of the German people, but also to the interests of European collective security, and is a major contribution to opposing aggression and guaranteeing peace.
    In December 1955, a government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, visited China, and after sincere and friendly talks, the two countries concluded a treaty of friendship and cooperation. The Chinese people wholeheartedly sympathize with and enthusiastically support the struggle of the German Democratic Republic and the German people for the peaceful reunification of Germany. Resolving the issue of peaceful reunification of Germany is a matter for the German people themselves, which first requires the rapprochement of the two existing Germanys.
    In the past year, thanks to the tremendous efforts made by the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, as well as other peace-loving countries and peoples, international tensions have eased to a certain extent, the principle of peaceful coexistence has received the support of more and more countries and peoples, the Bandung spirit and the Geneva spirit have become increasingly popular, and the so-called "position of strength" policy and "Cold War" policy have suffered a series of failures. This shows that as long as peace-loving countries and peoples persist in the struggle to safeguard peace, the aggressive policies and war plans of the aggressive blocs can be stopped and thwarted.
    However, the American aggressive bloc and its followers are not reconciled to their failure, still adhere to their bankrupt "position of strength" policy, and intensify their arms expansion and war preparations, promote colonialist aggressive plans, and carry out threats and provocations against peace-loving countries and peoples. The American authorities once again put forward that notorious "liberation" policy, and issued so-called "Christmas greetings" that grossly interfered in the internal affairs of the people's democratic countries of Europe. Dulles even attempted to use atomic war to intimidate the Chinese and world people, and even openly declared that the policy of the current American government is to bring the whole world to the "brink of war." This shows that the American ruling clique is trying its best to obstruct the easing of the international situation, because they need to create tension in order to ensure the maximum profit for monopoly capital in arms expansion and war preparations, and to find excuses for American foreign aggression and expansion.
    The American aggressive bloc uses the defense of the so-called "communist threat" as a guise for its war preparations and aggression. We have no doubt that the spearhead of the American aggressive bloc's war preparations is first directed at the Soviet Union, China, and all the people's democratic countries. But we have never been, and will never be, intimidated by its war threats. On the contrary, the Chinese people once drove the American aggressive forces and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique supported by them cleanly and thoroughly out of the Chinese mainland; the Korean and Chinese people also gave the invaders a severe lesson. It is clear that the American aggressive bloc will never gain any advantage against the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. In fact, under the guise of opposing the "communist threat," the American imperialist bloc is carrying out aggression against all other countries in the world. This situation is now particularly prominent in the relationship between the United States and many Asian and African countries.
    The United States has always adhered to its colonialist policy in its treatment of Asian and African countries, attempting to maintain and strengthen its rule over the people of Asian and African countries, so that the people of Asian and African countries are always in a state of enslaved backwardness politically, economically, and culturally, subject to the manipulation of imperialists, and become tools for them to launch aggressive wars. The American aggressive bloc has long occupied Japan, attempting to revive Japanese militarism and turn Japan into its war base; obstructing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue; colluding with the South Vietnamese authorities to undermine the Geneva Agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina; occupying China's territory Taiwan by force; organizing the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc; working with other colonial countries to undermine the sovereignty of Arab countries in the Middle East and suppress national independence movements everywhere; supporting the Baghdad Treaty Organization pieced together by Britain, which is unanimously opposed by the people of Asia and Africa and the people of the world, and so on. The American aggressive bloc also openly supports the criminal colonial system, for example, Dulles once described India's Goa and China's Macau as Portuguese "provinces." As for the so-called economic and technical "aid" provided by the American aggressive bloc to many Asian and African countries, it is actually in order to obtain political, economic, and military privileges in the recipient countries, strengthen political control and economic enslavement over the recipient countries, and place them in a subordinate position to the United States.
    Therefore, it is not surprising that this aggressive policy of the United States has been met with increasingly strong opposition from the people of Asian and African countries.
    In order to deal with the dissatisfaction and resistance of the people of Asian and African countries, and to obstruct the establishment of friendly relations between the people of Asian and African countries and the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, the American aggressive bloc and its accomplices have recently fabricated lies such as the so-called "threat and infiltration" of communism into Asian and African countries, in order to carry out intimidation and deception. However, the people of Asian and African countries have seen through the truth of this lie from their own history and personal lives. The people of Asian and African countries will never be deceived by the imperialists and give up the struggle for national independence, nor will they be intimidated by their threats. The increasingly awakened people of Asia and Africa have realized that as long as they persist in unity and persist in struggle, the shackles of colonialism will surely be shattered, and no force in the world can stop the victory of their struggle for independence and liberation. The struggle of the people of Asian and African countries for political, economic, and cultural independence is just, and is a great contribution to the cause of world peace and progress. They have received, and will continue to receive, the sympathy and support of the socialist camp and the people of the world. The era of colonialism is gone forever.
    Comrades! The Government of the People's Republic of China has always pursued a policy of maintaining peace. We believe that European peace and Asian peace are indivisible. The 600 million Chinese people will always unite with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and unite with all peace-loving countries and people, to fight for world peace and the security of the people of all countries.
    At the beginning of 1956, considering the new changes in the international situation, the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states held this meeting to exchange views and make decisions on the international situation and future tasks, and on further strengthening the friendship, cooperation, and defense capabilities of the participating countries, which is of extremely great significance. The Government of the People's Republic of China is confident that this meeting will have a great impact on the cause of peace in Europe and the world, and on easing international tensions.

    1月28日在华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议上
    中华人民共和国观察员聂荣臻元帅的发言主席同志、各位代表同志：
    请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府热烈地祝贺会议的成功。
    中华人民共和国政府认为，根据1955年5月14日在华沙签订的八国友好合作互助条约的规定，召开这次政治协商委员会会议，就当前国际形势和今后任务交换意见并且作出相应的决定，是完全必要的和适时的。毫无疑问，这些决定对于维护和平和缓和国际紧张局势有着重大的意义。
    对于帝国主义侵略集团加紧武装、准备战争、企图把自己的意志强加于人的所谓“实力地位”政策，爱好和平的国家和人民是不能坐视不理的。为了世界和平和社会主义阵营各国安全的利益，进一步加强华沙条约组织，加强缔约国间的友好、合作和互助是完全必要的。在这方面，有着重大意义的事件是德意志民主共和国决定建立自己的人民军队，并且将要参加华沙条约缔约国联合司令部武装部队。
    尽人皆知，德意志民主共和国是爱好和平的国家，是德意志和平、民主和进步力量的堡垒，它坚持按照欧洲安全和德国人民的利益解决德国问题，使德意志成为一个统一、和平、民主、独立的国家。但是美国侵略集团和它的追随者却坚持武装西德，把西德拖进北大西洋集团，并且公然企图用西德吞并民主德国，使整个德意志参加这一侵略性的组织。在这种情况下，德意志民主共和国尽一切力量维护国家的安全和劳动人民已经取得的成果，不但是必要的，而且是急需的。中华人民共和国政府和人民，完全支持德意志民主共和国建立人民军和参加联合司令部武装部队，并且认为这不但符合德国人民的利益，而且也符合欧洲集体安全的利益，这是反对侵略和保障和平的一项重大贡献。
    1955年12月，以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问了中国，并且经过真诚友好的会谈，两国缔结了友好合作条约。中国人民衷心同情和热烈支持德意志民主共和国和德国人民为德意志的和平统一而进行的斗争。解决德意志和平统一问题，是德国人民自己的事情，这首先要求现存两个德国的接近。
    过去的一年中，由于以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营以及其他爱好和平的国家和人民所进行的巨大努力，国际紧张局势已经有了一定的和缓，和平共处的原则得到了越来越多的国家和人民的支持，万隆精神和日内瓦精神也越来越深入人心，所谓“实力地位”政策和“冷战”政策遭到了一连串的失败。这就说明，只要爱好和平的国家和人民坚持维护和平的斗争，侵略集团的侵略政策和战争计划是能够被制止和被挫败的。
    但是，美国侵略集团和它的追随者却不甘心于他们的失败，依然坚持他们已经破产的“实力地位”政策，并且加紧扩军备战，推行殖民主义的侵略计划，向爱好和平的国家和人民进行威胁和挑衅。美国当权人物又一次提出了那个臭名昭彰的“解放”政策，发表了对欧洲各人民民主国家内政进行粗暴干涉的所谓“圣诞贺词”。杜勒斯更企图用原子战争恐吓中国和世界人民，甚至公然宣布，美国现政府的政策就是要把全世界带到“战争边缘”。这就表明，美国统治集团是要竭力阻挠国际局势的和缓的，因为他们需要制造紧张，以便在扩军备战中为垄断资本保证最大限度的利润，为美国的对外侵略和扩张寻找借口。
    美国侵略集团是以防御所谓“共产主义威胁”作为它准备战争和实行侵略的幌子的。我们毫不怀疑，美国侵略集团准备战争的矛头是首先针对着苏联、中国和所有人民民主国家的。但是我们从来没有，而且也绝不会被它的战争威胁所吓倒。相反地，中国人民就曾经把美国的侵略势力和它扶持下的蒋介石卖国集团干净、彻底地赶出了中国大陆；朝中人民也曾经给过侵略者以严厉的教训。很明显，对于以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营各国，美国侵略集团是永远占不到任何便宜的。事实上，美帝国主义集团在反对“共产主义威胁”的幌子之下，正在进行着对世界上其他地区的所有国家的侵略。这种情况，现在特别突出地表现在美国对待许多亚非国家的关系上。
    美国对待亚非国家一直坚持它的殖民主义政策，企图维持和加强它对于亚非各国人民的统治，使亚非各国人民在政治上、经济上和文化上始终处于被奴役的落后的地位，听凭帝国主义者的摆布，并且成为他们发动侵略战争的工具。美国侵略集团长期占领着日本，企图复活日本军国主义，变日本为它的战争基地；阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决；勾结南越当局破坏恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议；以武力霸占中国的领土台湾；组织东南亚侵略集团；同其他殖民国家一道在中近东破坏阿拉伯国家的主权，镇压各地的民族独立运动；支持英国拼凑为亚非人民和全世界人民一致反对的巴格达条约组织，等等。美国侵略集团还公然支持罪恶的殖民制度，例如杜勒斯就曾经把印度的果阿和中国的澳门说成是葡萄牙的“省”。至于美国侵略集团向许多亚非国家提供的所谓经济和技术“援助”，实际上是为了要在受援国取得政治、经济和军事上的特权，加强对受援国的政治控制和经济奴役，使它们处于美国的附属地位。
    因此，美国的这种侵略政策，遭到亚非各国人民越来越强烈的反对，这是丝毫不足为怪的。
    为了对付亚非各国人民的不满和反抗，为了阻挠亚非各国人民同苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家建立友好关系，最近美国侵略集团和它的同谋者又在制造所谓共产主义对亚非各国的“威胁和渗入”等谎言，用以进行恐吓和欺骗。但是，亚非各国人民从自己的历史和切身生活中已经看穿了这种谎言的真相。亚非各国人民绝不会受帝国主义者欺骗而放弃争取民族独立的斗争，也不会被它们的威胁所吓倒。日益觉醒的亚非人民已经认识到，只要他们坚持团结，坚持斗争，殖民主义的枷锁是一定能够被粉碎的，世界上没有任何力量可以阻止他们争取独立和解放的斗争的胜利。亚非各国人民为争取政治、经济、文化上的独立所进行的斗争是正义的，是对于世界和平和进步事业的巨大贡献，他们已经得到，并且将继续得到社会主义阵营各国和全世界人民的同情和支持。殖民主义者的时代已经是一去不复返了。
    同志们！中华人民共和国政府一贯执行着维护和平的政策。我们认为，欧洲和平和亚洲和平是不可分割的。六万万中国人民将永远同苏联和各人民民主国家团结在一起，同一切爱好和平的国家和人民团结在一起，为世界和平和各国人民的安全而奋斗。
    值此1956年年初，考虑到国际局势的新的变化，华沙条约参加国政治协商委员会举行这次会议，就国际形势和今后任务，就进一步加强与会各国友好合作和防御力量，交换意见并作出决定，是有着极其重大的意义的。中华人民共和国政府确信，这次会议对欧洲和全世界的和平事业，对和缓国际紧张局势，都将发生巨大的影响。　　（新华社）
