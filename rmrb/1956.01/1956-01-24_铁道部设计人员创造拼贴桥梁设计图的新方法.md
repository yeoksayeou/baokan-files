    Designers at the First Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways have created a method of collaging bridge design drawings, which can save two-thirds of the time compared to general drawing methods. The new method involves first designing different styles of bridge piers, abutments, etc., separately, and then photocopying each type many times. When drafting, the photocopied bridge pier and abutment drawings are pasted one by one onto blank drawing paper according to the required quantity and style, with the necessary elevations and dimensions noted, quickly completing the design drawing of a bridge. This saves time compared to redrawing each time, and is easier for less skilled people to master.
    Designers have now used this new method to produce design drawings for 26 bridges for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, which have been delivered to the construction units ahead of schedule.

    铁道部设计人员创造拼贴桥梁设计图的新方法
    铁道部第一设计院的设计人员创造了一种拼贴桥梁设计图的方法，它能比一般的绘图方法节省三分之二的时间。新的方法就是先把不同式样的桥墩、桥台等分别设计出来，然后把每种复印成许多份。制图的时候就把复印的桥墩、桥台图，按照需要的数量和式样一个一个贴在空白图纸上，注上各个必要的标高和尺寸，很快就完成了一座桥梁的设计图。这样就比每次都重新绘制的方法节省时间，不熟练的人也比较容易掌握了。
    现在设计人员已经用这种新方法为兰新铁路制出了26座桥梁的设计图，提前交给施工单位。（新华社）
