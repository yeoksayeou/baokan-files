Xinhua News Agency, January 11th:

    "Asahi Shimbun" published a commentary on January 10th, accusing the United States of transporting jet bombers to Japan. The commentary said that the B-57 bomber is obviously an offensive weapon. In this way, the Japanese base takes on the nature of an American atomic bombing base. The Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister have repeatedly stated in the Diet that Japan will not be turned into an atomic bombing base. The newspaper then questioned: Is the United States disregarding the Japanese government's opposition, or is the Prime Minister lying in the Diet?
    "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out: The current world situation, especially the Far East situation, is moving in a peaceful direction. Deploying bombers capable of carrying atomic bombs in Japan runs counter to peace.

    “朝日新闻”指责美喷气轰炸机运日
    据新华社11日讯  “朝日新闻”1月10日发表评论，指责美国把喷气式轰炸机运到日本。评论说，B—57型轰炸机显然是攻击性的武器，这样，日本的基地就有了美国的原子轰炸基地的性质。日本首相和外务相曾经在国会中屡次声明，不把日本变成原子轰炸基地。这家报纸接着质问道：究竟是美国对日本政府的反对置之不理呢，还是首相在国会撒了谎呢？
    “朝日新闻”指出：今天的世界局势，特别是远东局势正朝着和平的方向前进，把可以载运原子弹的轰炸机配置在日本，是同和平背道而驰的。
