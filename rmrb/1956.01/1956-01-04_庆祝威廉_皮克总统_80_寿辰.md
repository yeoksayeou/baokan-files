    The Central Committee of the Free German Youth League held a celebration on the 2nd. In the evening, young men and women in Berlin held a torchlight parade. President Pieck's meeting with the youth made them ecstatic.
    Grand celebrations were also held in other regions of the Republic, such as Leipzig, Karl-Marx-Stadt, and Weimar.

    Voroshilov's Speech

    Xinhua News Agency, citing TASS, Berlin, 3rd: The Soviet delegation headed by Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, arrived in Berlin on the 2nd to participate in the celebration ceremony for the 80th birthday of Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic.
    The working people of Berlin held a welcoming rally in the square in front of the station. Voroshilov spoke at the meeting. He said: The life's work of Comrade Pieck, an outstanding figure of our time, is inseparable from the struggle of the progressive forces of the German people to build a Germany where the working people are masters of the country and of the wealth they create.
    The German Democratic Republic has firmly occupied its position as an equal member in the fraternal family of democratic countries. Consolidating friendly cooperation with these countries will help the German Democratic Republic to further improve its political, economic, and cultural standing and steadily increase its international prestige.
    Voroshilov said that the Soviet people sympathize with and understand the German people's desire for peace and the restoration of national unity. We are in complete agreement with the government of the German Democratic Republic that an agreement between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany is the only realistic way to resolve the issue of restoring German unity.
