Xinhua News Agency, January 16th: U.S. President Eisenhower submitted the budget message for the 1956-1957 fiscal year to Congress on January 16th. The message requests Congress to allocate large sums of money to continue military expansion and war preparations.

The message states that the total expenditure of the federal government is estimated to be more than $65.8 billion in the fiscal year from July 1, 1956, to June 30, 1957, which is about $1.6 billion more than the expenditure in the 1956 fiscal year.

The message says that America's military needs are "paramount and must continue to be fully met." The total expenditure for direct military spending and foreign "aid" in the 1957 fiscal year is more than $42 billion, an increase of about $1 billion compared to the 1956 fiscal year, accounting for about 64% of the total expenditure.

The message makes no secret of the warmongering nature of the new budget. While vigorously slandering the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy, it tries its best to show off America's intention to establish "the most powerful military force in peacetime history." In this regard, the message particularly emphasizes increasing "retaliatory power," that is, increasing the air force and atomic weapons. The message says that in the 1957 fiscal year, the United States will increase its stockpile of nuclear weapons, and the total expenditure for atomic energy is estimated to be about $1.9 billion. The funding for purchasing guided missiles will be the highest in American history, an increase of more than one-third compared to the 1956 fiscal year. The air force expenditure is the largest item in the Department of Defense's expenditure, totaling more than $16.5 billion, $500 million more than the 1956 fiscal year.

The message requests Congress to allocate $4.9 billion under the "Mutual Security Program" for foreign "aid," which is $2.2 billion more than the appropriation for the current year. Among the $4.3 billion in total actual expenditure for foreign "aid" in the new budget, "military assistance" accounts for $2.5 billion.

The section of the message concerning treasury revenue shows that the U.S. government is further shifting the burden of military expansion and war preparations onto the American people.

    美总统提出下年度预算咨文
    拨出大笔款项加紧扩军备战
    据新华社16日讯　美国总统艾森豪威尔1月16日向国会提出1956—1957财政年度的预算咨文。咨文要求国会拨出大笔款项，继续进行扩军备战。
    咨文说，在1956年7月1日到1957年6月30日为止的财政年度内，联邦政府的总开支估计为658亿多美元，比1956财政年度的开支约多16亿美元。
    咨文说，美国的军事方面的需要是“超越一切的，必须继续予以充分的满足”。总计1957财政年度的直接军费和对外“援助”的开支为420多亿美元，比1956财政年度约增加10亿美元，约占总支出64％。
    咨文毫不掩饰新预算的好战性质。它一面大肆污蔑苏联的和平外交政策，一面竭力炫耀美国要建立“和平时期历史上最强大的军事力量”。在这方面，咨文特别强调要增加“报复性力量”，也就是说要增加空军和原子武器。咨文说，在1957财政年度，美国将增加核子武器储存，用于原子能方面的开支总额估计约为19亿美元。购买定向飞弹的经费将是美国历史上最高的，比1956财政年度增加三分之一以上。空军的开支是国防部开支的最大项目，一共为165亿多美元，比1956财政年度多5亿美元。
    咨文要求国会在“共同安全计划”项下拨出49亿美元来进行对外“援助”，这比本年度的拨款多22亿美元。在新预算的对外“援助”全部实际开支43亿美元中，“军事援助”占25亿美元。
    咨文关于国库收入的部分说明，美国政府正在进一步把扩军备战的重担加在美国人民头上。
