    In Xinjin County, Liaoning Province, 75% of farmers have joined advanced agricultural production cooperatives. In one district, the number of farmers participating in advanced cooperatives accounts for 99.3% of the total number of farmers in the district. In this district, there are no more elementary cooperatives, only six large advanced cooperatives. The largest advanced cooperative has 2,183 households, including nine villages, and the smallest has 950 households.
    After several years of development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the production and living standards of farmers in Xinjin County have generally improved. Of the county's 1,036 elementary agricultural production cooperatives, 910 still increased production by 10% to 20% compared to mutual aid teams last year, despite encountering drought and insect pests. The income of members generally exceeded 30% to 50% before joining the cooperative, and some even exceeded it by 100%.
    Currently, all advanced cooperatives are carefully handling property issues after the transition to advanced cooperatives, and those that have completed the processing have already begun production activities.

    新金县75％的农户加入高级社
    辽宁省新金县已经有75％的农户参加了高级农业生产合作社。其中有一个区参加高级社的农户占全区农户总数的99.3％。在这个区里，已经没有初级社，只有六个大型高级社。最大的一个高级社有2，183户，包括九个村庄，最小的有950户。
    经过几年来互助合作运动的发展，新金县农民生产和生活水平普遍有了提高。全县1，036个初级农业生产合作社在去年虽然遇到了旱灾虫灾，但是有910个社仍然比互助组增产10％到20％。社员的收入一般都超过入社前30％到50％，有的甚至超过一倍。
    目前，各个高级社正在细致地处理转高级社以后的财产问题，处理完毕的社已经展开生产活动。
