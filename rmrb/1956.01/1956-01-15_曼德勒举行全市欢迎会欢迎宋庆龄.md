Xinhua News Agency, Mandalay, January 14th: The Mandalay municipal authorities in Burma held a city-wide welcome rally on January 13th to welcome Soong Ching Ling.

More than 1,000 Mandalay citizens participated in the welcome rally, including students, workers, government civil servants, representatives from various parties and organizations, and overseas Chinese.

At the entrance to the venue, Soong Ching Ling was warmly welcomed by Minister of Interior Bo Khin Maung Gale, Minister of Cooperatives Tekin Tha Kin, Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Mines U Tun Tin, Mandalay District Commissioner U Sheng Khue, and senior local government officials. Soong Ching Ling, accompanied by Daw Khin Kyi, wife of Aung San, Yao Zhongming, the Chinese Ambassador to Burma, and Wu La Mao, the Burmese Ambassador to China, walked past the welcoming crowd lining both sides.

In his welcoming speech, Bo Khin Maung Gale said that he welcomed the visit of the female leader of the close neighbor whom the Burmese call brothers. He then introduced Soong Ching Ling's accomplishments. Bo Khin Maung Gale concluded by expressing his belief that Soong Ching Ling's visit would promote friendship between Burma and China.

Soong Ching Ling delivered a speech at the rally. She began by expressing her gratitude for the welcome from the Mandalay authorities and people. She then spoke about the long history of friendly relations between China and Burma. She said that because we have maintained friendly relations in the past, we need to strengthen friendly cooperation in building our respective countries. We must help each other and strive together for our common cause in the spirit of peaceful coexistence. We must jointly oppose foreign aggression. In our struggle for national independence and against colonialism, we have always been comrades-in-arms. The Chinese people have always sincerely supported the achievements of the Burmese people in maintaining national independence and in national construction. The Chinese people are deeply grateful to the Burmese government and people for supporting the return of Taiwan to the People's Republic of China and for your just efforts to restore China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. Furthermore, since last year, our cooperation has extended beyond maintaining peace in Asia and easing international tensions. We have taken further steps to promote economic and technological cooperation between our two countries in the construction process. Premier Zhou Enlai said on Burma's Union Day that China is willing, as in the past, to provide Burma with all possible assistance in economic and technical fields based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. It is natural for us to maintain the closest friendly cooperation because we are neighbors, because we both have a history of anti-colonial struggles, and because both of our countries need to achieve modernization in industry and agriculture.

Soong Ching Ling said that it is also natural that there is a small handful of people in the world who are not only unhappy about the close relationship between our two countries but actually attempt to undermine our friendship by all means. Their purpose is to undermine the unity of the peoples of Asian countries in order to promote their infamous war conspiracy. But we know that the vast majority of people in the world are now awake. People around the world have suffered the lessons of imperialism, and they refuse to fall into the trap of imperialism again. We do know that the vast majority of people support world peace. Only a very few people outwardly hope for peace, but actually hope for war. This is the reason why the continued easing of the international situation has been the main trend after the Geneva Conference on the Indochina ceasefire and the Bandung Conference.

Soong Ching Ling said: The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have been established as norms of international morality. On the basis of these principles, not only are the friendships between Burma, China, India, and Indonesia developing day by day, but we are also pleased to see that Burma's economic relations with other peace-loving countries are also developing. It is expected that more and more countries will establish friendly relations among themselves on the basis of these principles. The obvious anti-colonialist trend shown by Asia and Africa since last year will never be reversed by any divide-and-rule policies or so-called foreign economic aid. We must strengthen our confidence. As long as we are united and vigilant, we can overcome all difficulties and defeat the enemies of peace. Although colonialism still casts its shadow in some corners of the world, these shadows will eventually be eliminated. The further consolidation of friendly relations among countries that have individually or jointly declared the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence will certainly have a huge impact on the people who are still fighting against colonialism in those corners of the world. Therefore, I believe that expanding the spirit of the Bandung Conference to all regions of Asia and Africa and to the whole world is our lofty common task.

Soong Ching Ling's speech ended in cheers and applause. (Attached picture)

    曼德勒举行全市欢迎会欢迎宋庆龄
    新华社曼德勒14日电  缅甸曼德勒市政当局1月13日举行全市欢迎会欢迎宋庆龄。
    1，000多名曼德勒市民参加了这次欢迎会，其中有学生、工人、政府公务员、各党派、团体的代表和华侨。
    宋庆龄在会场的入口处受到了内政部长波庆貌格礼、合作社部长德钦达庆、矿务部驻国会秘书吴顿阵、曼德勒区专员吴盛却和当地政府高级官员的热烈欢迎。宋庆龄在昂山夫人都庆枝、中国驻缅甸大使姚仲明和缅甸驻中国大使吴拉茂的陪同下走过了排在两旁的欢迎人群。
    波庆貌格礼在致欢迎词时说：他欢迎缅甸人称为兄弟的亲密邻居的妇女领袖所进行的访问。接着，他介绍了宋庆龄的事迹。波庆貌格礼最后表示相信，宋庆龄的访问将促进缅甸和中国之间的友谊。
    宋庆龄在会上发表了演说。她首先对曼德勒当局和人民的欢迎表示感谢。接着她谈到了中缅两国友好关系的悠久历史。她说，由于我们在过去一直保持着友好关系，我们更需要在建设我们各自的国家方面加强友好的合作。我们必须本着和平共处的精神为了我们的共同的事业而互相帮助和共同奋斗。我们必须共同反对外国的侵略。在我们争取民族独立和反对殖民主义的斗争中，我们一向是战友。中国人民始终真诚地支持缅甸人民在保持国家独立的事业中和国家建设中取得的成就。中国人民对于缅甸政府和人民支持把台湾归还中华人民共和国和你们为恢复中国在联合国中的合法权利而作的正义的努力深为感激。此外，自从去年以来，我们的合作已经不仅仅限于保持亚洲和平和缓和国际紧张局势。我们已经采取了进一步的步骤来促进我们两国在建设过程中的经济和技术合作。周恩来总理在缅甸联邦国庆日那一天说：中国愿意像过去一样，根据平等互利的原则，在经济和技术方面给予缅甸一切可能的协助。我们保持最密切的友好合作是很自然的事，因为我们是邻邦，因为我们都有反殖民主义斗争的历史，又因为我们两国都需要在工业和农业方面获得现代化发展。
    宋庆龄说，世界上有一小撮人，他们不仅对我们两国之间的紧密关系感到不快，而且实际上企图以一切手段来损害我们彼此的友谊，这也是自然的事。他们的目的在于破坏亚洲各国人民的团结，以便推行他们的声名狼籍的战争阴谋。但是我们知道，世界上的绝大多数人现在已经觉醒了。世界各地人民都曾经饱尝帝国主义的教训，他们拒绝再落入帝国主义的陷阱。我们确实知道，绝大多数人是拥护世界和平的。只有极少数人表面上希望和平，实际上却希望战争。这就是实现印度支那停战的日内瓦会议和万隆会议之后，国际局势的继续缓和一直是主要趋势的原因。
    宋庆龄说：和平共处的五项原则已经被确定为国际道义的准则。在这些原则的基础上，不但缅甸、中国、印度和印度尼西亚之间的友谊正在一天一天发展，而且我们高兴地看到，缅甸同其他爱好和平的国家之间的经济关系也在不断发展。预料会有越来越多的国家将在这些原则的基础上建立它们之间的友好关系。从去年起亚洲和非洲明显地表现的反殖民主义的主流是决不会给任何分而治之的政策或是所谓对外经济援助扭转的。我们必须加强我们的信心。只要我们团结一致，提高警惕，我们就能够克服一切困难和击败和平的敌人。虽然殖民主义现在仍旧在世界的某些角落保持它的阴影，但是这些阴影最后一定会被消灭。已经各别地或是联合地宣布和平共处的五项原则的国家之间友好关系的进一步巩固，对于世界的那些角落中现在还在进行反殖民主义斗争的人民肯定会有巨大的影响。因此，我相信，把万隆会议精神扩大到亚洲和非洲的一切地区和全世界，这是我们的崇高的共同的任务。
    宋庆龄的演说在欢呼声和掌声中结束。（附图片）
