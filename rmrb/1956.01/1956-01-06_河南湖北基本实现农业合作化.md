    Henan and Hubei Basically Achieve Agricultural Cooperativization

    By the end of 1955, more than 78% of peasant households in Henan Province had joined agricultural production cooperatives, basically achieving semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. More than 1,000 advanced agricultural production cooperatives have also been established throughout the province. In Xinxiang Prefecture, 66% of the peasant households in the prefecture have joined advanced cooperatives. Together with the peasant households participating in elementary cooperatives, the number of households participating in cooperatives has reached 95% of the total number of households. While establishing cooperatives, more than 90,000 new and old cooperatives have also been rectified.

    Currently, in addition to actively engaging in winter production such as accumulating fertilizer and watering wheat, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are leading farmers outside the cooperatives in large-scale water conservancy construction. From December 20th to 30th last year, more than 10,000 various new wells were dug every day throughout the province. (Henan Daily Editorial Department)

    As of January 5th, Hubei Province had developed more than 144,800 agricultural production cooperatives, with more than 4,656,500 peasant households participating, accounting for 74.91% of the total number of households in the province. The province has basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization.

    Agricultural production cooperatives in various regions are formulating comprehensive plans for developing production and production plans for 1956. According to the plan, this year, 171 agricultural production cooperatives in Dangyang County will become high-yield rice cooperatives producing 1,000 jin per mu; the 17 agricultural production cooperatives in Daqiao Township, Wuchang County, aim to increase the total grain output by more than five times by 1962 compared to 1955. Under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, a surge of activities such as accumulating fertilizer and repairing ponds has been launched in rural areas. In the past month, agricultural production cooperatives in Yingcheng County have accumulated more than 40 million dan of fertilizer.

    河南湖北基本实现农业合作化
    河南省截至1955年年底，参加农业生产合作社的农户已经达到全省总农户的78％以上，基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。全省建立的高级农业生产合作社也已经有一千多个。新乡专区参加高级社的农户已经达到全专区总农户的66％，加上参加初级社的农户，入社农户已达总农户的95％。在建社的同时，还有九万多个新社、老社进行了整顿工作。
    现在，各地农业社除积极进行积肥、浇麦等冬季生产外，正带动社外农民进行大规模的水利建设。去年12月20日到30日，全省每天都打成各种新井一万多眼。（河南日报编辑部）
    截至1月5日，湖北省农业生产合作社已经发展到144，800多个，入社农户达4，656，500多户，占全省总农户的74.91％。全省已经基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。
    各地农业生产合作社正在制定发展生产的全面规划和1956年的生产计划。按照规划，当阳县今年将有171个农业生产合作社成为水稻千斤丰产社；武昌县大桥乡的17个农业生产合作社，到1962年的粮食总产量要比1955年增长五倍多。各地农村在农业生产合作社的带动下，掀起了积肥、修塘等热潮。应城县的农业生产合作社最近一个月来积肥四千多万担。
