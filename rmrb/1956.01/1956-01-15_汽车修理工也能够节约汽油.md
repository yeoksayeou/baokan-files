    Auto Mechanics Can Also Save Gasoline
    To the Editor:
    I am a worker in the auto repair department of the Xin Jin Machinery Factory, a state-owned enterprise in Liaoning Province. Since the nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy began, I have often wondered: how can I save raw materials for the country?
    I spend all day working with auto parts and gasoline for washing oil stains from the parts. The country needs gasoline very much. Currently, the factory uses 46 jin of gasoline for a major overhaul of a car. Can we use less? I thought, I always wash my hands with boiling water after work, so can I use boiling water to wash the oil stains from auto parts? I tried it, but it didn't work. The second time, I experimented with boiling water and alkali, and although the results were better, the oil stains on the parts were still not easy to wash off. The third time, I added some of the "labor protection soap" issued by the state when boiling the alkali water. This time it really washed away the grease. I was afraid that the water-washed parts would rust easily, so I wiped them with kerosene before installation.
    According to feedback from car owners, this does not affect the quality of repairs. However, each major overhaul saves 46 jin of gasoline, and only requires one bar of soap, one jin of alkali, ten jin of kerosene, and ten jin of firewood. If calculated at cost, it can save the state more than 12 yuan. Now, this method has been widely promoted throughout our workshop.

### 汽车修理工也能够节约汽油

    汽车修理工也能够节约汽油编辑同志：
    我是辽宁省地方国营新金机械厂汽车修理部的工人。自从全国开展增产节约运动以来，我就经常在想：我怎样能给国家节约原材料呢？
    我整天摆弄的是汽车零件和刷洗零件油污用的汽油。国家建设很需要汽油，目前厂里大修一台汽车要用46斤汽油，是不是能够少用一些呢？我想，我每天下班都是用开水洗手，那末洗汽车零件的油污是不是也能用开水呢？我试了一下，没有成功。第二次我又用开水加上碱末作试验，结果虽然好了一些，但是零件上的油污还是不容易洗掉。第三次我在煮碱水的时候再加上一些公家发给我的“劳保肥皂”，这回果真把油腻洗掉了。我怕水洗过的零件容易生锈，在安装以前都用火油擦过。
    这样做，根据车主反映，并不影响修车质量。但是，每大修一辆车就少用了46斤汽油，而只要用一块肥皂、一斤面碱、十斤火油和十斤木柴就可以了；如果折价计算，可以给国家节约12元多。现在，我们全车间已经广泛地推行这个办法。
