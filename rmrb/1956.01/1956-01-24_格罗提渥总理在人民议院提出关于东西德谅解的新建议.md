Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 23rd. German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl, in his speech to the People's Chamber on January 18, put forward new proposals regarding an understanding between East and West Germany. This proposal requests that the two Germanys conclude a treaty guaranteeing that they will not use force against each other, and will only achieve German unification through peaceful means.

The proposal also requests that both parts of Germany work to normalize relations and reach corresponding agreements in all aspects of economic and cultural life.

Grotewohl said: We have previously proposed the establishment of an All-German Committee. These issues could be discussed within this committee. We are always prepared for consultations between the two Germanys. Such consultations are conducive to the peaceful and democratic restoration of German unification.

    格罗提渥总理在人民议院提出关于东西德谅解的新建议
    新华社柏林23日电　德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥1月18日在人民议院的讲话中提出了关于东西德谅解的新建议。这个建议要求两个德国订立条约，保证不使用武力互相反对，只用和平的方法实现德国的统一。
    这个建议还要求德国两部分努力使双方关系正常化，并且在经济和文化生活各方面达成相应的协议。
    格罗提渥说：我们曾经建议成立一个全德委员会。在这个委员会里可以就这些问题进行协商。我们随时都准备着两个德国之间进行协商。这种协商是有助于和平与和平民主地恢复德国的统一的。
