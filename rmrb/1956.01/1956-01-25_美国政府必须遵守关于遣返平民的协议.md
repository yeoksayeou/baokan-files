    Editor's Note: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on January 21 regarding the Sino-U.S. talks, in which it said the following about the agreement on repatriating civilians: "As for the United States, any Chinese is free to leave the United States to go wherever he wants, and no one is denied permission to leave." However, continuous letters from family members of Chinese students in the U.S. prove that the U.S. State Department is completely lying. We are now publishing four more letters from family members and friends of students in the U.S. More than four months after the agreement was reached, these students, who are "anxious as fire," are still being detained in the United States. The "freedom" the United States gives them is the "freedom" to "apply for refugee status," the "freedom" to be blackmailed and extorted, and the "freedom" to be "exhausted" and still unable to return home. We, on behalf of the families and friends of these people, demand by name that the U.S. government abide by the agreement and allow them to return home as soon as possible.
    Letter from Zeng Mingqing, wife of Tao Qikun
    My husband, Tao Qikun, went to the United States to study in 1948. Since 1951, he has applied to return to China many times, but was blocked by the U.S. Immigration Bureau. Later, he was often summoned for illegal interrogations. For example, when he participated in the Chinese Association of Scientific Workers in the United States, the U.S. government forced the association to disband, and he was illegally summoned to ask him about the purpose of participating in the association and the content of the meetings, and ordered him to report his whereabouts to the Immigration Bureau every three months. In a letter in June 1955, he said that he had received a notice to return to China and was preparing to return immediately. However, in a letter on July 17, he said that because he could not buy a boat ticket twice, and later wanted to return from England via Canada, he had to return to his original place because the deadline had passed. The local Immigration Bureau gave him three options: 1. Apply for long-term residence in the United States. 2. Leave the country immediately (but in fact, he was obstructed). 3. Apply for refugee status, saying that only by applying for refugee status would he have the opportunity to return to China. Because he was eager to return to China, he was tricked into applying for refugee status. From that time until now, there has been no information. I request the government to investigate the whereabouts of my husband with the U.S. government and find a way to enable him to return to the motherland as soon as possible.

    --Attached is the last letter from Tao Qikun to his wife Zeng Mingqing
    Mingqing:
    I know you are waiting anxiously for my news and are probably disappointed now. I am in the same mood as you. I am still in the United States because the Immigration Bureau allowed me to return to China but gave me a short deadline. After the deadline, according to the example of a classmate in Chicago, I would be arrested, bailed, and tried. At first, I thought I could leave the country on time, so I told you not to write. Unexpectedly, I have not yet obtained a "President Company" ship ticket and could not catch the "Cleveland" or the "Wilson." Then I wanted to go through Canada or England, but they refused to grant entry visas because my passport had expired. Helpless, in order to avoid being humiliated, I took other steps. The so-called other steps, I applied for refugee status in the United States. Doing so makes me feel infinitely angry... For a month, I have been exhausted, and my mood has not yet stabilized...

    Letter from Chen Shangwen, classmate of Yan Jiqu
    My university classmate, Yan Jiqu, went abroad in 1945, first to England, and then transferred to the United States to study. The last time he wrote from the United States was on January 26, 1953. Since then, there has been no news, and I am extremely concerned. In this letter, he said:
    "You may already know the reason why I cannot return to China. Last year, the Korean armistice talks seemed very promising, and I thought I could pack my bags and return to China soon, but unexpectedly it has been delayed for so long." "Please do not mention in your letters that you hope I can return to China soon, as letters sent from China are likely to be inspected by the U.S. authorities. Also, please do not talk about political issues, as this may increase my troubles for no reason. You should know the political trends in the United States in recent years from reading the newspapers..."
    In a letter before this one, he said: "I originally planned to return to China this spring, but you may already know that since last autumn, the U.S. authorities have not allowed Chinese students studying science and engineering to return to China. Not only that, but they are not even allowed to go to other countries. In this way, I really don't know when I will be able to return to China."
    From these letters, it can be seen that he is suffering mentally in the United States because he is persecuted by the U.S. authorities and cannot return to China freely. Therefore, I hope that the government will negotiate with the U.S. government at the Geneva Conference to enable him to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible.

    Letter from Pang Zhenhua, child of Pang Yongxin
    My father, Pang Yongxin, went to the United States to study in 1943. At that time, my younger brother was not even one year old, and I was only five years old. Now, I am a high school student.
    My father initially studied at Johns Hopkins University in the United States, and after graduation, he specialized in radio science at the University of Chicago, and obtained a doctorate in 1950.
    Last year, in March or April, I received a letter from him. From his letter, I could see how eager he was to return to China. The letter said: "My heart is as anxious as fire, seven of my teeth have fallen out, and my hair is gray, but we cannot meet," "I go out early and return late alone, and I am extremely lonely, hoping to meet you soon." Since that letter, there has been no letter to this day. This must be because my father applied to return to China and was persecuted by the U.S. government.
    Our whole family hopes that he will return to China soon. My grandmother is nearly 80 years old, and every time she mentions her beloved son, she cries bitterly, regretting that she should not have let him go to the United States to study. My mother misses my father so much that she is even sick. She often says to me: "Alas! I don't know when that day will come! I'm really going crazy." Whenever I see the pain of my grandmother and mother, I feel very sad. How much I hate the U.S. government that does not let my father return to China!
    The matter is very clear. My father cannot return entirely because of the obstruction of the U.S. government. I want to protest, I want to accuse the U.S. government of this inhumane and agreement-violating behavior. Finally, on behalf of the whole family, I express my heartfelt gratitude to Ambassador Wang Bingnan, who is working hard in the negotiations in Geneva, and at the same time, I request the government to demand the return of my father from the U.S. government by name, so that he can serve the construction of the motherland and enable our family to reunite as soon as possible.

    Letter from Zhang Shuyu and Zhang Yali, children of Zhang Kun
    We are two elementary school students, please help us pass our hope to the government.
    Our dear father, Zhang Kun, studies ethnic languages. He went to Yale University in the United States in 1947 and obtained a doctorate in linguistics. Later, he taught at the University of Washington in the United States. It has been almost nine years since we have seen our dear father.
    When Dad left home, Shuyu was just two years old and didn't understand anything; Yali was born three months after Dad left. We see that our classmates all have parents and are so happy, and we often think of Dad. Mom is afraid that we will be sad, so she just tells us: "Dad will be back soon."
    Last summer vacation, Mom suddenly happily told us: "Kids! Dad wrote a letter saying that he can return to China, and he can probably come back this time!" We happily hugged Mom and jumped up! Mom then talked about Dad's affairs with grief and anger.
    It turned out that after the nationwide liberation, Dad had been planning to return to China. But the U.S. government did not allow him to return. In 1952, Dad booked a ship ticket to return, but unexpectedly, on the day before boarding the ship, the U.S. Immigration Bureau insisted that Dad owed income tax and detained him. Dad was studying at his own expense, and he didn't have any money, so he worked part-time in the United States, and his monthly income was only a few tens of dollars, just enough to eat. How could he owe income tax?
    In the three years since then, Dad's letters have also become less frequent, and even if he sends a letter, there are only a few words in it. Once, the letter mentioned that he had to go to the U.S. Immigration Bureau for talks every week. Since then, we have not heard any news about Dad returning.
    Mom started crying when she said this, and we brothers both hugged Mom and cried. Finally, Mom stroked our heads and said: "Yali, you are a child who has never seen your father. Remember that Dad was so happy when he received the letter of your birth that he invited a few friends to celebrate your birth! Now you are eight years old and you are also going to school. How happy Dad will be to see you!" Dad loves us so much!
    But it has been half a year, and Dad, whom we have been waiting for day and night, has still not returned. Why? We don't know at all. Recently, I heard that the U.S. government wants to send the Chinese in the United States to Taiwan. We hate Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor, to death! Can we let the U.S. government send our dear father to Taiwan? No! Never! We want Dad to come back and build our great motherland. We often hear our uncle say: "Now our party and government are helping ethnic minorities develop their culture, and they need talents like your father very much."
    Dear editor uncle, we firmly request the government to help us demand the return of our father from the U.S. government, and we must ask the U.S. government to let our father come back quickly.

### 美国政府必须遵守关于遣返平民的协议

    美国政府必须遵守关于遣返平民的协议
    编者按：美国国务院21日就中美会谈发表声明，其中关于遣返平民的协议说：“至于美国，任何中国人都可以自由离开美国去他要去的任何地方，没有一个人被拒绝准许出境。”但是，连续不断的留美学生的家属的来信证明美国国务院完全是在撒谎。现在我们再发表四个留美学生的家属和朋友的来信。在协议达成之后四个多月的今天，这些“心急如火烧”要回国的留学生还被扣留在美国。美国给予他们的“自由”是“申请作难民”的“自由”，是被勒索敲诈的“自由”，是“弄得筋疲力竭”仍然不能回国的“自由”。我们代表这些人的家属和朋友指名要美国政府遵守协议，迅速让他们回国。
    陶启坤的妻子曾明清的来信
    我的丈夫陶启坤在1948年去美国留学。从1951年开始多次申请回国，但都被美国移民局所阻。以后又经常被传去非法询问。譬如他在美国参加过中国留美科学工作者协会，美国政府迫令这个会解散时，他就被非法传去，问他参加这个会的目的以及开会谈话内容等，并令他每隔三个月向移民局报告一次行迹。1955年6月来信说已得到回国通知，并马上准备回国。但在7月17日又来一封信说，因为两次买不到船票，后欲经加拿大从英国回来，又因限期已过，只有回到原地。当地移民局给他三个条件：1、申请长期居留美国。2、马上出境（事实又被阻挠）。3、申请作难民，并谓作难民才有回国的机会。因为他回国心切，被骗申请作难民。从这时候起到现在，就一直没有信息。我请求政府向美国政府调查我丈夫的下落，并设法使他能够早日回到祖国。

    ——附陶启坤给他妻子曾明清最后的一封信明清：
    我知道你们在殷切等我的消息而现在大约已在失望中。我正和你们陷于同样的情绪。我现在还身居美国，原因是移民局许我回国而给我一个短的期限，过期，根据芝加哥一位同学的例子，便是逮捕、交保、过庭判拨。初，我还以为可以如期离境，因此告诉你不必来信，不料迄今未得“总统公司”船票，赶不上“克利扶兰”号，也搭不上“威尔逊”号。继而想由加拿大或英国走，他们以护照过期的理由而不与入境签证。无何，为了避免受侮辱，我采取了别的步骤，所谓别的步骤，我申请了以难民身份留美。这样做，自己觉得无限忿怒，……一月以来，弄得我筋疲力竭，心情迄未安定……。

    严际蘧的同学陈尚文的来信
    我的大学同班同学严际蘧，在1945年出国，先去英国，后来转到美国留学。他最后一次从美国来信是在1953年1月26日，以后就无音讯，不知下落，极为关切。他在这封信中说：
    “不能回国的原因也许你早知道，去年朝鲜和谈看样子大有希望，满以为可早日整装回国，不料竟拖延如此之久。”“你来信请别提到希望我能早日回国，现在由国内寄来的信，难说不受美国当局检查。另外一样，就是请你别谈政治问题，因为可能凭空给我增加麻烦，你读报纸该知道近几年美国的政治趋向……”
    他在这封信以前的一封信中说：“原来预备在今年春天回国的，可是你也许早知道，美国当局自去年秋天起，不准学科学和工程的中国的留学生回国。不但这样，即使去别国都不允许。这样一来，真不知道什么时候能回国了。”
    从这些来信中可以看出他在美国由于受到美国当局的迫害，不能自由回国，精神上很痛苦。因此，希望政府在日内瓦会议上向美国政府交涉，使他早日回到祖国怀抱。

    庞永信的孩子庞镇华的来信
    我的父亲庞永信，在1943年去美国留学。那时我的弟弟还不满一岁，我才有五岁。现在，我已是一个高中学生了。
    我的父亲起初在美国约翰大学念书，毕业以后在芝加哥大学专门研究无线电学，在1950年得博士学位。
    去年三、四月间收到他的一封信，从他的信中可以看到他回国的心情多么迫切。信中说：“我的心急如火烧，牙齿掉了七个，头发花白，然不能见面”，“我一人早出晚归，孤单异常，盼能早日见面”。自从这封信以后，到现在就一直没有信来了。这一定是因为我父亲申请回国而遭到美国政府迫害的缘故。
    我们全家都盼他早日回国。我的祖母年近80，每次提到他心爱的儿子就痛哭流涕，懊悔以前不应让他到美国留学。我的母亲想念我父亲甚至成病，她时常对我说：“唉！不知要等到那一天啦！我真要急疯了。”每逢我看到祖母和母亲的痛苦，我就非常难过。我是多么痛恨那不让我父亲回国的美国政府呀！
    事情很清楚，我父亲不能回来完全是由于美国政府阻挠的结果。我要抗议，我要控诉美国政府这种不讲人道和违反协议的行为。最后，我代表全家向在日内瓦辛苦进行谈判的王炳南大使表示衷心的感激，同时，要求政府指名向美国政府要回我的父亲，为祖国建设事业服务，使我们一家早日团聚。

    张琨的孩子张述禹、张雅礼的来信
    我们是两个小学生，请帮助我们把我们的希望转给政府。
    我们亲爱的爸爸张琨，是研究民族语文的。1947年到美国耶鲁大学读书，得到语言学博士。后来就在美国华盛顿大学教书。快九年了，我们没有见到亲爱的爸爸。
    爸爸离家的时候述禹刚刚两岁，什么都不懂；雅礼还是在爸爸走后三个月才出生的。我们看见同学们都有爸爸妈妈，多么快乐，我们常常想到爸爸。妈妈怕我们难过，只是告诉我们：“爸爸不久就会回来的”。
    去年暑假里，妈妈忽然快乐的告诉我们：“孩子！爸爸来信说，他可以回国了，大概这次可以回来了！”我们高兴地抱着妈妈跳起来了！妈妈这时才悲愤地谈起爸爸的事。
    原来全国解放后，爸爸一直都在打算回国的。但美国政府不准他回来。1952年，爸爸订好了船票准备回来，没想到就在上船的前一天，美国移民局硬说爸爸欠了所得税，把爸爸扣下来了。爸爸是自费留学的，没有钱就在美国半工半读，每个月的收入只几十美元，刚够吃饭，怎么能说得上欠了所得税呢？
    此后三年里，爸爸的信也少了，就是来一封信，信中也只是几句话。有一次信上提到，每星期还要到美国移民局去谈话。从此也没有听到爸爸要回来的消息了。
    妈妈说到这里就流泪了，我们哥俩都抱着妈妈哭了。最后，妈妈用手抚摸着我们头说：“雅礼，你是从来没有见过爸爸的孩子，记得爸爸得到你出生的信后，喜欢得还请了几个朋友来庆贺你的诞生呢！现在你八岁了，也上学了，爸爸回来看见你们，要多么高兴啊！”爸爸是多么喜欢我们啊！
    可是，已经半年了，我们日夜盼望的爸爸还是没有回来。为什么？一点也不知道。最近听说美国政府要把在美国的中国人送到台湾去。提起蒋介石这个卖国贼，我们就恨死他！我们能让美国政府把我们亲爱的爸爸送到台湾去吗？不！决不！我们要爸爸回来建设我们伟大的祖国。我们常常听到舅舅说：“现在我们的党和政府正在帮助少数民族发展文化，很需要你爸爸这样的人材。”
    亲爱的编辑叔叔，我们坚决请求政府帮助我们向美国政府要回我们的爸爸，一定要美国政府让我们的爸爸快快回来。
