    The United States Should Immediately Stop Delaying Sino-US Talks

    The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on January 18, revealing the truth about the Sino-US ambassadorial talks. This statement allows the world to see where the reason for the long delay and lack of progress in the Sino-US talks lies.

    Since the agreement on the repatriation of civilians was reached on September 10, 1955, the Sino-US talks have not been able to reach an agreement on the second item on the agenda for more than four months. Facts have proved that this is entirely due to the US side's deliberate delay of the talks and its unwillingness to ease and eliminate the tension in the Taiwan area.

    After the Chinese side reached an agreement on the first item on the agenda, it immediately suggested entering into a discussion of the second item on the agenda, and suggested discussing the "embargo issue" and the "preparation for higher-level Sino-US negotiations" in this item. The US side initially refused to discuss the second item on the agenda, and then entangled the meeting with the issue of implementing the first item agreement. It was not until nearly a month after the first item on the agenda was reached that the US side proposed that the two sides should first issue a statement renouncing the use of force.

    The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out in the statement that China has always advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes between China and the United States without resorting to force or threats. This proposition is based on the consistent position of the Chinese government: all international disputes should be resolved through peaceful consultation. Based on this position, we disregarded the obstruction of the United States and insisted on the Korean armistice negotiations, so that an agreement was reached. We have also worked hard to assist in reaching an agreement to restore peace in Indochina. China's statement during the Asian-African Conference that China and the United States should sit down and negotiate, and its proposal to hold higher-level negotiations between the two countries during the Sino-US talks, are all aimed at realizing this proposition.

    Originally, the so-called issue of non-use of force was a unilateral issue between China and the United States. It is the United States that has been and is continuing to use force to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, rather than China using force against the United States or any territory of the United States. It is because the United States occupies Taiwan and uses force and threats against China that it has created an international dispute between China and the United States and created tension in the Taiwan area. The Sino-US ambassadorial talks should discuss ways to peacefully resolve this issue. As for the Chinese people liberating Taiwan and the way in which Taiwan is liberated, this is entirely China's internal affair. The Chinese people have liberated the entire Chinese mainland and many coastal islands. These liberation actions, no matter how they were carried out, have never caused international disputes or tension in the international situation. It can be seen that China's liberation of Taiwan and how to liberate Taiwan is a matter that the United States should not and has no right to interfere with, and is China's internal affair that no one can interfere with. This issue of China's internal affairs must not become a topic for discussion at the Sino-US talks.

    Based on this position, the Chinese side first put forward its own draft statement, which fully demonstrated its sincerity in seeking a solution to the problem. The draft advocated resolving disputes between them by peaceful means without resorting to threats or force in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter; advocated holding a meeting of the foreign ministers of the two countries to discuss the issue of easing and eliminating tension in the Taiwan area. It is obvious that ambassadorial talks cannot resolve the tension in the Taiwan area caused by the US use of force against China, and only holding a meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the United States is a practical and feasible way.

    However, the US side not only refused to specifically mention the specific provisions of the United Nations Charter in the statement, but also refused to stipulate the holding of a meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the United States. This has made the ambassadorial talks statement lose its way of realization. Obviously, the United States wants to use a piece of paper to bind China's right to exercise sovereignty over its own territory, forcing our country to recognize the US occupation of Taiwan. Isn't it very obvious that the US side does not want to ease the tension in the Taiwan area?

    Not only that, but in the draft statement put forward by the US side two months after the agreement on the first item on the agenda was reached, it openly demanded that the Chinese side recognize the so-called "separate and collective defense" rights of the United States in the Taiwan area.

    May I ask, what "separate and collective defense" rights does the United States have in Taiwan? Taiwan is China's territory. What qualifications does the United States have to come to China's territory to carry out so-called "defense"? The Chinese people's liberation of their own territory of Taiwan has not threatened the United States, which is far across the Pacific Ocean. The US occupation of Taiwan has infringed upon China's sovereignty and threatened China's security. The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, the restoration of their own territory, and the exercise of their own sovereignty are the inherent rights of the Chinese people. The US occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and the threat to China's security is a naked act of aggression. The Chinese people have every right to resist aggression, to remove the US threat of force, and to protect their own security. The United States only has the obligation to withdraw from Taiwan and remove the threat to the Chinese people in accordance with the United Nations Charter, and there is no such thing as a "right" to "defense."

    Even so, in order to promote the talks, the Chinese side made further efforts and put forward a new draft statement. The new draft included all the points that both sides had agreed to and could agree to, and did not include any content that either side disagreed with or could not agree to. However, the United States neither agreed nor opposed this new draft in three consecutive meetings. It was not until January 12 this year that the United States put forward a counter-proposal, which still unreasonably demanded that China recognize the so-called "inherent right of individual and collective self-defense" of the United States in the Taiwan area, so that the two sides have been unable to reach an agreement after more than four months of negotiations.

    The course of the Sino-US talks over the past five months shows that the Chinese side hopes that the Sino-US talks can pave the way for resolving disputes between the two countries and eliminating the tension in the Taiwan area. However, the United States attempts to use the Sino-US talks to affirm its occupation of Taiwan, force the Chinese people to recognize the US occupation of Taiwan, and maintain and intensify the tension in the Taiwan area. For more than five months, the United States has deliberately delayed at the negotiating table, refusing to reach an agreement, and at the same time, it has carried out distorted propaganda outside the meeting, attempting to shift the responsibility for delaying the talks to China. The United States itself violated the agreement reached by the two sides on the issue of the return of civilians, and took further obstructive and threatening measures against Chinese expatriates and students who requested to return to China, but also made unfounded accusations against the Chinese side, which faithfully implemented the agreement. It is worth noting that US Ambassador Johnson, the US representative to the Sino-US talks, also repeated this distorted and misrepresented accusation in a public statement on January 18. This shows that the US side has not yet given up its attempt to create excuses to delay the talks. At the same time, the United States is constantly intensifying its military activities in the Taiwan area. US Air Force Secretary Callis openly clamored that China's coastal islands are part of the US base. Dulles recently published a conversation in "Life" magazine, attempting to intimidate the Chinese people with atomic war and openly clamoring for the "brink of war" policy. All this is not accidental.

    People remember that the US policy of strength and atomic intimidation failed to save the US's tragic defeat in the Korean War. After the US aggressors were driven back to the 38th parallel in Korea, they finally had to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. The US policy of strength and atomic intimidation has not been able to prevent the restoration of peace in Indochina, but has only made the United States itself in a completely isolated position. Similarly, this policy of the United States has not been able to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Yijiangshan Island and Nan'ao Island, forcing the Chiang bandit army to withdraw from Dachen and Nanjie. Now, while the Sino-US talks are underway, the United States is still trying to threaten the Chinese people with this already bankrupt policy of intimidation, which can only show that the United States is deliberately maintaining and intensifying the tension in the Taiwan area, and cannot have any effect on the victorious Chinese people. The statement of the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs clearly states that the Chinese government will continue to strive to resolve disputes between China and the United States through negotiations. However, the US government must stop delaying Sino-US talks and make corresponding efforts. The US government now stands before world public opinion, and it must show to the peace-loving people of the world whether it is prepared to ease and eliminate the tension in the Taiwan area through negotiations.

### 美国应该立即停止拖延中美会谈

    美国应该立即停止拖延中美会谈
    我国外交部发言人1月18日发表声明，公布了中美两国大使级会谈的真相。这个声明使全世界看到，中美会谈长期拖延而得不到进展的原因究竟在哪里。
    从1955年9月10日在双方平民回国问题上达成协议以后，在四个多月的时间内，中美会谈一直没有能够对第二项议程取得协议。事实证明，这完全是由于美国方面蓄意拖延会谈，不愿意和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势。
    中国方面在第一项议程达成协议以后，就立即建议进入第二项议程的讨论，并且建议在这一项议程中讨论“禁运问题”和“准备更高一级的中美谈判问题”。美国方面起初是拒绝谈第二项议程，随后又用执行第一项议程协议的问题在会上纠缠。直到第一项议程达成协议将近一个月之后，美国方面才提出中美双方应该首先发表放弃使用武力的声明。
    我国外交部发言人在声明中指出，中国一贯主张和平解决中美两国之间的争端而不诉诸武力和威胁。这个主张是基于中国政府的一贯立场：一切国际纠纷都应该以和平协商的方式来解决。本着这个立场，我们不顾美国的阻挠，坚持了朝鲜停战谈判，使之达成协议。我们也曾努力协助达成了恢复印度支那和平的协议。我国在亚非会议期间声明中美两国应该坐下来谈判，在中美会谈中建议举行两国更高一级的谈判，都是为了实现这个主张。
    本来，所谓不使用武力的问题在中美之间是一个单方面的问题。是美国已经而且正在继续使用武力侵占我国领土台湾，而不是我国对美国或美国的任何领土使用了武力。由于美国侵占台湾，对中国使用武力和威胁，这才造成了中美之间的国际争端，造成了台湾地区的紧张局势。中美大使级会谈应该讨论和平解决这个问题的途径。至于中国人民解放台湾以及用什么方式解放台湾，这完全是中国内部的事情。中国人民曾经解放了整个中国大陆和许多沿海岛屿。这些解放行动，不论它们是用什么方式进行的，都从来没有引起国际争端和国际局势的紧张。可见中国解放台湾以及如何解放台湾，是美国不应该，也无权过问的事情，是任何人都不能干涉的中国内政。这个中国内政的问题决不能成为中美会谈讨论的题目。
    中国方面根据这个立场，首先提出了自己的声明草案，这个草案充分显示了谋求解决问题的诚意。草案中主张根据联合国宪章的规定用和平方法解决它们之间的争端而不诉诸威胁或武力；主张举行两国外长会议，协商和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势问题。十分明显，大使级会谈不可能解决美国在台湾地区对中国使用武力威胁所引起的紧张局势问题，只有举行中美外长会议才是切实可行的途径。
    但是美国方面却不但不愿意在声明里具体提到联合国宪章的特定条款，而且也不肯规定举行中美外长会议。这就使大使级会谈的声明失却了实现的途径。显然，美国是想用一纸声明来束缚中国对自己的领土行使主权的权利，迫使我国承认美国强占台湾。美国方面并不想和缓台湾地区的紧张局势岂不是非常明显么？
    不但如此，美国方面在第一项议程达成协议两个月以后才提出来的声明草案中，还公然要求中国方面承认美国在台湾地区有所谓“单独和集体防御”的权利。
    试问，美国在台湾有什么“单独和集体防御”的权利可言？台湾是中国的领土，美国有什么资格到中国的领土上来进行所谓“防御”？中国人民解放自己的领土台湾并没有威胁到远在太平洋彼岸的美国。美国侵占台湾却侵犯了中国的主权，威胁了中国的安全。中国人民解放台湾，恢复自己的领土，行使自己的主权，是中国人民的固有权利。而美国侵占中国的领土台湾，威胁中国的安全，是赤裸裸的侵略行为。中国人民有一切权利反抗侵略，驱除美国的武力威胁，保障自己的安全。美国只有按照联合国宪章撤出台湾、解除对中国人民的威胁的义务，根本谈不上有什么“防御”的“权利”。
    虽然如此，中国方面为了促进会谈曾作了进一步的努力，提出了新的声明草案。在新草案中包括了双方所已经同意和可以同意的各点，而没有包括任何一方所不同意或者不能同意的内容。但是美国对这个新草案在接连三次会上既不同意，也不反对。直到今年1月12日美国才提出了一个对案，其中仍然无理地要求中国承认美国在台湾地区有所谓“单独和集体的自卫的固有权利”，以致双方在经过四个多月的谈判以后，始终无法取得协议。
    五个多月中美会谈的经过表明，中国方面希望中美会谈能够为解决两国之间的争端、消除两国之间在台湾地区的紧张局势开辟道路。而美国却企图利用中美会谈来肯定它对台湾的侵占，强迫中国人民承认美国侵占台湾，保持和加剧台湾地区的紧张局势。五个多月来，美国一方面在会议桌上故意拖延，拒绝达成协议，一方面在会外进行歪曲宣传，企图将拖延会谈的责任推在中国身上。美国自己违反了双方对平民回国问题所达成的协议，对于要求回国的中国侨民和留学生采取了进一步阻挠和威胁的措施，却还对忠实实施协议的中国方面提出毫无根据的指责。值得注意的是，中美会谈美方代表约翰逊大使在1月18日的公开声明中还重复了这种歪曲和曲解事实的指责。这就表明，美方至今还没有放弃制造借口来拖延会谈的企图。与此同时，美国在台湾地区还不断加紧军事活动。美国空军部长卡利斯公然叫嚣说中国沿海岛屿是美国基地的一部分。杜勒斯最近在“生活”杂志上发表谈话，企图用原子战争对中国人民进行恫吓，公然叫嚣什么“战争边缘”政策。所有这一切都不是偶然的。
    人们记得，美国的实力政策和原子恐吓政策并没有能够挽救美国在朝鲜战争中的惨痛失败，美国侵略者被赶回到朝鲜三八线以后，终于不得不签订了朝鲜的停战协定。美国的实力政策和原子恐吓政策并没有能够阻挠印度支那和平的恢复，而只是使美国自己处于完全的孤立地位。同样地，美国的这种政策也并没有能够阻止中国人民解放—江山岛和南澳岛，迫使蒋贼军队撤出大陈和南麂。现在，正当中美会谈进行的时候，美国还企图用这种早已破产的恐吓政策来威胁中国人民，那只能表明美国蓄意保持和加剧台湾地区的紧张局势，对于胜利的中国人民不能起任何的作用。我国外交部发言人的声明清楚地说明：中国政府将继续争取通过谈判来解决中美之间的争端。但是，美国政府必须停止拖延中美会谈，作出相应的努力。美国政府现在已经站到了世界舆论面前，它必须向全世界爱好和平的人民表明，它究竟是否准备通过谈判来和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势。
