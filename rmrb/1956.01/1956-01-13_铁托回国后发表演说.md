Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, January 11th: According to TASS, the President of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, Tito, returned to Pula, Yugoslavia, on the morning of January 10th aboard the "Galeb" ship after visiting Ethiopia and Egypt, according to the Yugoslav News Agency.

A mass meeting was held in the port of Pula to welcome Tito, attended by 60,000 citizens from Pula and surrounding areas. Tito delivered a speech at the meeting.

Tito said that in Ethiopia and Egypt, we held talks on many issues such as the international situation and diplomatic circumstances, and exchanged views on ways to maintain peace and on mutual assistance and cooperation. A common view was reached during the talks: the current situation is much better than before, because hundreds of millions of people are increasingly actively opposing the revival of the "Cold War" and all wars.

Tito continued, we are convinced during our visits to Egypt and Ethiopia that the people of both countries must have external help, and the people of both countries are worthy of help, because they themselves are already maximizing their potential to develop their own countries.

When we visited Egypt, we were convinced that the Egyptian people especially yearn for peace. It is often said that Egypt is making threats. However, this is unfounded. The Egyptian people are deeply convinced that only in a peaceful environment can they achieve the goal of developing their country. Egypt does not want war.

In terms of the international situation, we came to the common conclusion that peace must be maintained, that we should not join any side, that we must strengthen the forces that hope to resolve international problems peacefully, that we must stop the expansion of armaments, and that the world's resources must be used to benefit mankind, not to destroy mankind.

President Tito finally said: We are convinced during this visit that cooperation between countries with different social systems is not only possible, but also easily achievable.

    铁托回国后发表演说
    据新华社11日讯  据塔斯社贝尔格莱德讯：据南斯拉夫通讯社报道：南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国总统铁托在访问埃塞俄比亚和埃及以后，已经在1月10日早晨乘“加勒布号”轮船回到南斯拉夫的普拉港。
    在普拉港举行了群众大会来欢迎铁托，参加大会的有普拉市和附近地区的公民六万人。铁托在大会上发表了演说。
    铁托说，在埃塞俄比亚和埃及，我们就国际情势、外交情况等许多问题进行了会谈，就维护和平的途径以及相互帮助、相互合作的问题交换了意见。会谈中取得了这样一种共同的看法：目前情势比以往大大好转了，因为亿万人民日益积极地反对复活“冷战”，反对一切战争。
    铁托接着说，我们在访问埃及和埃塞俄比亚的时候确信：它们两国人民必须有外部的帮助，两国人民是值得帮助的，因为他们自己已经在最大限度地利用自己的潜力来发展自己的国家。
    当我们在埃及访问的时候，我们相信埃及人民尤其渴望和平。往往有人说，埃及在进行威胁。但是，这是毫无根据的。埃及人民深深相信，只有在和平环境当中，他们才能实现发展自己的国家的目标。埃及不希望战争。
    在国际局势方面，我们得出共同的结论：必须要维护和平、不加入任何一方面、必须要加强希望以和平方式来解决国际问题的力量、必须要停止扩张军备，世界上的富源必须用来造福人类，而不是用来毁灭人类。
    铁托总统最后说：我们在这次访问中相信，社会制度不同的国家之间的合作不仅是可能，而且很容易实现。
