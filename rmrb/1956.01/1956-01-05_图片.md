    The Zhuhu Village People's School in Jubao Township, Changde County, Hunan Province, has not only achieved results in literacy work in the year or so since it was established, but has also played a role in promoting the agricultural cooperation movement in the village. Li Deqing, a poor peasant who studies at the people's school, is now able to fluently read the newspaper for the members of the cooperative. Photo by Zhang Yunlong (From *New Hunan Daily*)
