The Happy Life of Collective Farm Members in the Soviet Union

	The Affluent Collective Farm
	The Stalin Collective Farm in Novoalexandrovsk District, Stavropol Krai, is one of the most affluent collective farms in the Soviet Union. In the past two years, the farm's annual income has increased from 11 million rubles to nearly 17 million rubles. Now this collective farm is planning for even greater development. The farm has built a breeding station that can accommodate 2,500 pigs and eight sheepfolds that can accommodate 18,000 sheep. In addition, 1,500 mu of orchards and 3,000 mu of vineyards have been opened up. It is expected that the corn sowing area of the Stalin Collective Farm will be expanded to nearly 60,000 mu next year.
	In the past two years, the Stalin Collective Farm has spent 2 million rubles on modern electrical equipment. Last summer, the farm spent nearly 1 million rubles to build a fully equipped sanatorium in the world-renowned Kislovodsk mineral spring area, exclusively for the rest and recuperation of farm members. By 1958, the income of the farm members will be doubled again. According to the farm chairman, Liskin, they also plan to open a university on their farm.

	The Income of a Shepherd Family
	Ivan Kryakhov and his wife Antonovna are shepherds in the Stalin Collective Farm in Balashov Oblast. Their two daughters, Olga and Maria, work in the farm's sunflower production team. This year, their family worked a total of 2,320 workdays. As a result, they received 4,640 kilograms of grain, a lot of vegetable oil, honey, vegetables, feed for privately owned livestock, and 23,200 rubles.
	In addition, the two elderly people received an extra wage of ten sheep, and the daughters received 200 kilograms of vegetable oil for exceeding their task. Altogether, the family's annual income exceeded 36,000 rubles. At the same time, the family also owns a cow, a two-year-old calf, ten sheep, and two piglets.
	There are many families like the Kryakhovs in the local area.

	150 Television Sets
	The store in Gorenki Village, Kiev-Svyatoshin District, Ukraine, has been particularly lively recently. The members of the Kaganovich Collective Farm in this village have purchased many motorcycles, bicycles, radios, televisions, and furniture from the store. Now, the residents of this village alone own 150 television sets. The collective farm members watch television programs broadcast by the Kiev Television Center at home every day.

	Million-Ruble Cultural Allocation
	A new club has recently been established in Leuţel Village, Bălţi District, Moldavian Republic. It has a hall with 300 seats, a library, and several rooms for amateur art activities. In the Lenin Collective Farm in Slobodzeya District of the Republic, the construction of a permanent cinema has been completed. It was built with funds from the collective farm. The income of the Lenin Collective Farm exceeded 10 million rubles last year. Therefore, it was possible to allocate nearly 1 million rubles from the income for the construction of cultural facilities on the farm.

    苏联集体农庄庄员们的幸福生活
    富足的集体农庄
    斯塔夫罗波里边区诺沃亚历山得罗夫斯克区的斯大林集体农庄，是苏联最富足的集体农庄之一。在过去两年里，农庄的每年收入已经从1，100万卢布增加到将近1，700万卢布。现在这个集体农庄正在规划着更大的发展。农庄里已经兴建了可容纳2，500只猪的饲养站和可容纳18，000只羊的八个羊圈。此外还开辟了1，500亩的果园和三千亩的葡萄园。预计明年斯大林集体农庄的玉蜀黍播种面积将要扩大到近六万亩。
    在过去的两年里，斯大林集体农庄用在现代化电气装备上的款项已达到二百万卢布。去年夏天农庄更花费了将近一百万卢布在世界闻名的疗养地基斯洛沃得斯克矿泉区修建了一个专供庄员们休养的设备齐全的疗养院。到1958年，农庄庄员们的收入将再增加两倍。据农庄的主席里斯金说，他们还计划在自己的农庄里开办一所大学。
    牧羊人一家的收入
    伊凡·克里亚霍夫和他的妻子安东诺夫娜是巴拉索夫州斯大林集体农庄的牧羊工。他们的两个女儿奥尔加和玛丽娅在农庄的向日葵生产队里工作。今年他们一家总共做了2，320个劳动日。结果得到了4，640公斤的粮食，许多植物油、蜂蜜、蔬菜、供给私人所有的牲畜的饲料和23，200个卢布。
    除此以外，两个老人还得到了十只羊的额外工资，而女儿们则因为超额完成任务而得到了二百公斤的植物油。加在一起，全家的一年收入超过了36，000卢布。同时，他们一家还拥有一头奶牛、一头两岁的小牛犊，十只羊和两只小猪。
    像克里亚霍夫这样的家庭，在当地是不少的。
    150架电视机
    乌克兰基耶伏—斯维亚托辛区戈连基村的商店里，最近显得特别热闹。这个村里的卡冈诺维奇集体农庄的庄员们，在店里购得了许多摩托车、自行车、无线电收音机、电视机和家具。现在，光是这个村里的居民，就已拥有150架电视机。集体农庄庄员们每天都在家里收看由基辅电视中心播送的电视节目。
    百万卢布的文化拨款
    摩尔达维亚共和国别尔茨区的列乌采尔村里，最近新建立了一个俱乐部。它里边设有一个有三百个座位的大厅，一个图书馆和几间供业余艺术活动用的房间。在共和国斯洛勃捷区的列宁集体农庄里，完成了一所经常性的电影院的建筑。它是用集体农庄的经费建造的。列宁集体农庄的收入去年已超过了一千万卢布。因此就可能从收入中拨出近一百万卢布来用于农庄的文化设施建筑。
