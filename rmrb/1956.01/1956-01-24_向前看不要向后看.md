Look Forward, Don't Look Back

Rural areas across the country are currently formulating production plans. Judging from the existing materials, some plans are very advanced, thus giving the peasant masses great encouragement. However, some plans are not advanced enough, and even quite conservative. Why is this? The main reason is that the ideological leadership in some areas lags far behind the objective situation.

In recent months, the cooperative movement has greatly developed across the country. There are now 2 million cooperatives nationwide, with farmer households joining accounting for over 60% of the total. Many provinces have basically achieved agricultural cooperativization. This means that the rural areas nationwide have changed from being dominated by small-scale farming to being dominated by cooperative economies. This change in production relations determines that an upsurge in agricultural production will inevitably follow the upsurge in cooperativization. However, many leading cadres have not seen this huge and fundamental change, and therefore their thinking has not yet escaped the confines of small-scale farming. When the Yueqing County Committee of Zhejiang Province was discussing the formulation of the 1956 production plan, the following debate arose: One view was that the 1956 production increase target should exceed that of 1955 by 10%; the other view was that it should not exceed 10%, but only exceed 7%. Originally, even a target exceeding 10% was not advanced enough, yet some people thought it was an "impetuous" target, an impossible target to achieve. The reason given by these leading cadres was: Experience over the past few years has proven that production cannot be increased too much. In fact, the problem lies in this "experience over the past few years." What kind of experience is that? It is the experience of small-scale farming with individual management. Under the conditions of small-scale farming, of course, only a few percentage points of increase are possible. If it is the experience of collective management under a cooperative economy, then it is not a few percentage points of increase, but a dozen or several dozen percentage points of increase. After Fuqing County in Fujian Province promoted the "wide-row close-planting" cultivation method of the Guanghui Cooperative in Dongying Township, the sweet potato yield of many cooperatives increased by one to three times compared to the original, with the highest yield being more than 13,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. The Zhang Shirui Cooperative in Jimo County, Shandong Province, created the experience of large-scale yield increases. The average grain yield of this cooperative reached 1,563 jin per mu. Precisely because the thinking of a few leading cadres still remains at the level of individual economy, they are not active in promoting various new agricultural tools and various advanced experiences. In Zhejiang, some people oppose the promotion of the double-wheeled double-shared plow. They say: "Yellow cattle are weak, water buffalo are disobedient, one cow can't pull it, and two cows will fight." Therefore, the double-wheeled double-shared plow cannot be used. When leading cadres in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, discussed promoting the experience of large-scale contracting in cooperatives in 1955, some people advocated conducting key experiments at the county level in 1955, key experiments at the district level in 1956, key experiments at the township level in 1957, and promoting it throughout the county in 1958. According to this plan, the entire socialist transformation of agriculture would be delayed by three or four years.

In Comrade Chen Boda's "Explanation on the Draft Resolution on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperativization," it has already been pointed out that land reform is to break the shackles of feudal production relations, which is the first step in the liberation of agricultural productive forces, "this is the first revolution." The socialist cooperative movement is the transition from individual economy to collective economy in production relations, which is to break the shackles of capitalist production relations, which is the second step in the liberation of agricultural productive forces, "this is the second revolution." This means that what the individual economy cannot do can be done after cooperativization, and what the individual economy cannot do well can be done well after cooperativization. This is completely true: The 40-li long protective forest on both sides of the Yellow River in Helan County, Gansu Province, was originally planned to be completed in three years; after cooperativization, this huge project was completed in one day. Comparing one day with three years, what a huge change this is! How great the power of cooperativization is! However, many leading cadres cannot see this fact and only see the difficult situation of the small-scale economy in the past.

Some people say: "You say that my thinking is conservative, but I represent the thinking of the broad masses of peasants." This is also the almanac of last year. The thinking of peasants has undergone great changes before and after cooperativization. Before cooperativization, it is true that the thinking of many peasants was conservative, mainly because under the conditions of the individual economy, neither human nor material resources could carry out major production reforms. After cooperativization, the vast majority of peasants actively demand increased production and increased income. Therefore, they are also willing to carry out various reliable production reforms. Therefore, when a few cooperatives put forward backward production targets, the members shouted loudly in opposition, saying: "What's the point of doing this!" "Is this socialism?" When the cooperative formulated an advanced production plan, the members were all beaming with joy and enthusiastically supported it. Peng Yonghe, an old member of over 70 years old in Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, said happily after seeing his cooperative's plan: "Our cooperative's production plan is really good, I'm just afraid of dying early now!"

Whether cooperatives can massively increase production has actually become a question of whether semi-socialist cooperatives can be consolidated, and whether semi-socialist cooperatives can develop into fully socialist cooperatives. In 1955, more than 3,000 mu of rice paddies reclaimed in the Lucheng Township area of Daxing County, Hebei Province, yielded about 400 jin per mu. These rice paddies were originally alkaline land where nothing could be harvested. This change not only enabled the cooperative movement in the Lucheng Township area to move forward by leaps and bounds, leading to a fully socialist cooperative movement; but also influenced the primary cooperatives in nearby areas to demand the establishment of advanced cooperatives, so as to concentrate greater strength to carry out this major production reform.

Rich peasant elements do not want cooperatives to massively increase production. Therefore, the thinking of a few leading cadres that massive production increases are impossible and that production has reached its peak is applauded by rich peasant elements. At the same time, the idea that massive production increases are impossible and that production has reached its peak is essentially a manifestation of capitalist thinking. They do not understand that socialist construction has just begun, and they do not understand that rural areas must strive to increase production to support socialist industrialization. Therefore, opposing conservative thinking in leading agricultural production is essentially an aspect of the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads.

One of the important methods to oppose conservative thinking in leading agricultural production is to conduct ideological inspections from top to bottom, expose all kinds of conservative thinking, and subject them to serious criticism. It is necessary to conduct in-depth and meticulous investigations and research, and use concrete facts to criticize and correct conservative thinking, and encourage cadres not only to oppose conservatism in their thinking, but also to have full confidence and practical and feasible methods to complete advanced production plans. Shandong has achieved great success by adopting this method.

When formulating this year's agricultural production plan, all localities should fully utilize advanced high-yield experiences. All parts of the country have created many experiences in large-scale yield increases. For example, more than 300,000 mu of double-cropping rice in Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, achieved an average yield of 1,002 jin per mu; the average yield of 42 mu of rice in Shijiajing Agricultural Cooperative in Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, exceeded 1,000 jin per mu; there were 520,000 mu of cotton fields in Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, with an average yield of 85 jin of ginned cotton per mu; and the average yield of 500 mu of spring corn in Xujiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Ji County, Hebei Province, was 930 jin per mu. Party organizations at all levels and agricultural work departments of the government should quickly summarize and promote local yield-increasing experiences. Jiangsu Province has scheduled to convene a provincial representative meeting of agricultural high-yield cooperatives on January 25 to exchange high-yield experiences and create "thousand-jin counties," "thousand-jin districts," "thousand-jin townships," and "thousand-jin cooperatives." Fujian Province organized representatives of farmers from more than 20 coastal counties (cities) to visit the high sweet potato yield increase experience in Fuqing County last year. The representatives learned both yield-increasing methods and broke down conservative thinking. These practices should be universally adopted.

It should also be pointed out that opposing conservative thinking is not advocating impetuous thinking. Conservative thinking means that things that are objectively possible to do, subjectively, people do not work hard to do. Impetuous thinking is just the opposite. It is trying to do things that are objectively impossible to do, and even resorting to coercive orders to do them. Therefore, we must not only oppose conservative thinking, but also prevent rash advances.

    向前看不要向后看
    全国各地农村正在制定生产规划。从现有的材料来看，一部分规划是很先进的，因而给予农民群众以很大的鼓舞。但是也有一部分规划是不够先进甚至是很保守的。这是为什么呢？最主要的原因，还是有一些地区领导思想远远落在客观形势的后边。
    近几个月来，全国合作化运动有了很大的发展，全国已有合作社200万个，入社农户已占总农户的60％以上，好些省份基本上实现了农业合作化。这就是说：全国农村已由小农经济占优势改变为合作经济占优势，这种生产关系的改变，就决定了农业生产高潮必然随着合作化的高潮到来。但是不少领导干部并没有看到这种巨大的带根本性质的变化，因而看问题还没有跳出小农经济的圈子。浙江乐清县委在讨论制定1956年生产规划的时候，就发生了这样的争论：一种意见是认为1956年的增产指标应当比1955年超过一成；一种意见是认为不能超过一成，只能超过7％。本来超过一成的指标也还是不够先进的，可是却有人认为这是“冒进”的指标，是不可能实现的指标。这些领导干部的理由是：几年来的经验证明不能增产太多。其实，问题就出在这个“几年来的经验”上。几年来的经验是什么经验呢？是小农经济个体经营的经验，在小农经济的条件下，当然只能增产百分之几。如果是合作经济的集体经营的经验，那就不是增产百分之几，而是增产百分之十几或者百分之几十。福建省福清县推广东营乡光辉合作社的“大畦密植”耕作法以后，许多合作社的番薯产量都比原来的提高一倍到三倍，最高的产量每亩收番薯13，000多斤。山东即墨县张式瑞合作社创造了大面积增产的经验。这个合作社的每亩土地平均收粮达到1，563斤。正因为少数领导干部的思想还停留在个体经济上面，所以在推广各种新式农具和各种先进经验的时候，是不积极的。浙江就有人反对推广双轮双铧犁。他们说：“黄牛力气小，水牛不听话，一条牛拉不动，两条牛要打架”。因此不能使用双轮双铧犁。1955年四川内江县领导干部讨论在合作社中推广大包工经验的时候，就有人主张1955年在县级实行重点试验，1956年在区级实行重点试验，1957年在乡级实行重点试验，1958年在全县推广。按照这个计划，就会把整个农业社会主义改造推迟三、四年。
    在陈伯达同志“关于农业合作化问题的决议草案的说明”中，已经指出：土地改革是打破封建主义生产关系的束缚，这是农业生产力的第一步解放，“这是第一个革命”。社会主义的合作化运动是从个体经济转到集体经济的生产关系，是打破资本主义生产关系的束缚，这是农业生产力的第二步解放，“这是第二个革命”。这也就是说，个体经济所不能办的事情，合作化以后就能办了，个体经济所办不好的事情，合作化以后就能办好了。这完全是事实：甘肃省贺兰县黄河两岸的40里长的防护林，原计划三年完成；合作化以后用一天时间就完成了这个巨大工程。一天与三年比较，这是多么巨大的变化呀！合作化的力量多么巨大呀！但是许多领导干部看不到这一事实，还只看过去小农经济的困难状况。
    有些人说：“你说我这些思想保守，但是，我是代表着广大农民的思想的。”这也是去年的皇历。合作化前后，农民的思想是有很大变化的。在合作化以前，确有不少农民的思想是保守的，这主要是因为在个体经济的条件下，人力物力都不能进行较大的生产改革。在合作化以后，绝大部分农民积极要求增加生产，增加收入。因而也愿意进行各种可靠的生产改革。因此少数合作社提出落后的生产指标的时候，社员就大叫大喊地反对，说：“这有什么干头！”“这叫社会主义吗？”当合作社制定出先进的生产规划以后，社员个个兴高采烈，热情拥护。山东荣成县70多岁的老社员彭永和看到自己社里的规划以后高兴地说：“咱们社的生产规划真好，我现在就怕早死了！”
    合作社能不能大量增产，实际上已成为能不能巩固半社会主义性质的合作社，能不能从半社会主义性质的合作社发展为全社会主义性质的合作社的问题。河北大兴县1955年在芦城乡一带开垦的三千多亩稻田，每亩收400斤左右。这些稻田原来是碱地，颗粒不收的。这种变化，不仅使芦城乡一带的合作化运动大踏步地前进一步，出现了全社会主义的合作化运动；而且影响附近地区的初级社也要求成立高级社，以便集中较大的力量，进行这种较大的生产改革。
    富农分子是不希望合作社大量增产的。因而少数领导干部的不能大量增产和增产已经到顶的思想，正为富农分子所鼓掌欢迎。同时，认为不能大量增产和增产已经到顶的思想，实质上就是资本主义思想的一种表现。他们不了解社会主义建设刚刚开始，不了解农村必须努力增加生产，支援社会主义工业化建设。因此，反对领导农业生产上的保守思想，实质上就是社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的一个方面。
    反对领导农业生产上的保守思想的重要方法之一，就是自上而下地进行思想检查，把各种各样的保守思想揭发出来，加以严肃的批判。必须经过深入细致的调查研究，用具体的事实来批判和纠正保守思想，鼓励干部不只是在思想上反对保守，而且还有十足的信心和切实可行的办法来完成先进的生产计划。山东采用这一方法取得了很大的成就。
    在制定今年的农业生产规划的时候，各地都应该充分运用先进的丰产经验。全国各地已经创造了不少大面积增产的经验。例如广东潮安县30多万亩双季稻，每亩平均产量达到1，002斤；江苏昆山县施家泾农业合作社有42亩水稻每亩平均产量一千多斤；浙江慈溪县有52万亩棉田，每亩平均产皮棉85斤；河北冀县徐家庄农业合作社有500亩春玉米，每亩平均产量930斤。各级党组织和政府农业工作部门都应该迅速地总结和推广当地的增产经验。江苏省定在1月25日召开全省农业高额丰产社代表会议，交流高额丰产经验，创造“千斤县”“千斤区”“千斤乡”“千斤社”。福建省曾在去年组织了沿海20多个县（市）农民代表参观了福清县大番薯增产经验，代表们既学会了增产的办法，又打破了保守思想。这些做法都应该普遍采用。
    也应当指出，反对保守思想，并不是提倡冒进思想。保守思想就是客观上可能办的事情，主观上却不努力去办。冒进思想恰恰相反，它是客观条件不可能办到的事情，硬要去办，甚至不惜采用强迫命令的方法去办。因此，我们既要反对保守思想，也要防止急躁冒进。
