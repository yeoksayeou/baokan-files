    The Situation After the French Elections
    Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party
    The most prominent event in the early French elections on January 2nd was the victory of the French Communist Party in the elections. It received a total of 5,622,879 votes, 625,529 more than in 1951, making it the leading party in France. The trend towards the left was so strong that not only did the Communist Party gain more votes, but the Socialist Party also gained more votes, and even some other left-wing political organizations gained more votes. If the Socialist Party and the Radical Party had adopted the proposals put forward to them by the Communist Party, then the victory of a left-wing majority, including 151 Communist Party members and their allies, formed through the election would have been even greater.
    In the 1951 elections, our party was robbed of dozens of seats due to the majority alliance system. This time, because we were unable to abolish the party alliance system, we proposed to the Socialist Party and the Radical Party to form an alliance with the Communist Party in order to turn the weapon of the party alliance system against the reactionary forces. If the Communist Party's proposal had been adopted, then these three parties would have won all the seats in 40 provinces, thus causing a very heavy loss to the reactionary forces. However, due to the continued existence of the party alliance system, its widespread use by the reactionary parties, and the refusal of the Socialist Party and the Radical Party to form an alliance with the Communist Party, the reactionaries actually maintained some positions that they were very likely to lose.
    Although the French Communist Party obtained 151 seats, it did not obtain the seats it should have obtained if the party alliance system had been abolished. In fact, it was still robbed of 37 seats this time. However, the official propaganda organs had to admit the greatness of the Communist Party's victory, because the Communist Party increased by 50 seats and more than 600,000 votes.
    After this victory of the left wing, the French working class and the people of the whole country expect the formation of a left-wing government and the formation of a left-wing majority in the parliament including the Communist Party members. But this is exactly what the reactionaries fear most, because they have not forgotten the victory of the Popular Front in 1936. The more the working people feel encouraged about the prospect of a new Popular Front, the more determined the reactionaries are to use all means to prevent the recurrence of this experience, because the masses of people not only have fresh memories of the past experience, but also have been inspired by it with great hope. This explains why, as soon as the election ended, people on the reactionary side advocated the formation of an alliance government by the right-wing parties and the "Republican Front," including the Socialist Party and the Radical Party of Mendès-France.
    The former President of the Republic, the Socialist Vincent Auriol, has openly expressed his approval of this method of surrendering to the reactionary forces, the direct consequence of which is undoubtedly to betray the promises made by the Socialist Party to the people in the recent election campaign, and the result will only be that the right-leaning policies discarded by the general election will continue to be implemented. However, such a proposition is not easy for the masses to accept, and it is precisely for this reason that the leaders of the Socialist Party, while opposing the formation of a left-wing government and a parliamentary left-wing majority including the Communist Party, launched the formation of a "Republican Front" minority government. Such a government will inevitably become a prisoner of the reactionary forces, and the reactionary forces will use all means to obstruct the parliament and prevent it from passing measures that conform to the expectations and interests of the French working class and the people of the whole country.
    The French Communist Party has always adhered to its statements made before the election, and has always been willing to reach an agreement with the Socialist Party and other Republican groups so that France can have a government that meets the expectations of the masses of the people. Therefore, on January 7, it put forward a very important proposal to the Socialist Party and the Radical Party, advocating that representatives from the three parties (Communist Party, Socialist Party, Radical Party) jointly discuss the formation of a government and the formulation of a program. According to the Communist Party, this program should first include the following points: peaceful settlement of the Algerian issue through consultation; improvement of the lives of working people in urban and rural areas; implementation of the minimum program of the "National Committee for the Defense of Non-Church Schools"; resolute opposition to all sabotage activities; implementation of policies leading to disarmament and relaxation of the international situation. These propositions of the Communist Party are in line with the propositions of the French working class and the masses of the people of the whole country.
    The French people demand a quick solution to the Algerian issue so that French soldiers participating in the Algerian war can return home as soon as possible. If the government to be formed in the future is in a position subordinate to the reactionary right wing due to the refusal of the Socialist Party and the Radical Party to reach an agreement with the Communist Party, then it is obvious that the solution of the Algerian issue will not only be delayed, but will also be undermined.
    It is equally obvious that if the government to be formed in the future intends to reconcile with the reactionary forces, then even if it does not dare to openly form an alliance with the reactionaries, it will inevitably be subjected to the pressure of the reactionaries, and therefore will not be able to improve the living conditions of the people according to the expectations of the people: increase wages, salaries, pensions and retirement benefits; increase the minimum wage for various occupations; abolish the regional wage differences that cause losses to millions of workers in the provinces, etc.
    Similarly, the government can only firmly rely on the parliamentary left-wing majority including the Communist Party, and have no illusions about the reactionary forces, and then it will be possible to implement the minimum program of the "National Committee for the Defense of Non-Church Schools," abolish those laws against the separation of church and state, and restore the principle of separation of church and state and the principle of separation of state and religion.
    There is also no doubt that a government controlled by the right wing cannot take resolute action against destructive attempts. Fascism can only be completely defeated under the banner of the unity of the working class and the unity of all democratic forces. Today, France does not have a fascist crisis like in 1934, attempting to carry out an armed rebellion on February 6 of that year to overthrow democratic freedom, but this has not prevented the list of candidates proposed by the adventurer Poujade from not only obtaining the votes of merchants and craftsmen, because these people are dissatisfied with the tax system that damages them, but also obtaining the votes of some De Gaulle elements and Pétain elements. This means that the reactionary elements who share fascist tendencies have gathered behind the adventurer Poujade and have some plans that are known to everyone for their intentions. Only the working class can unite and fight, and only all left-wing forces can unite to defeat these conspiracies.
    If the government to be formed in the future becomes a prisoner of the reactionary forces, then there is no doubt that it will not be able to pursue an independent foreign policy, will not be able to take effective actions to promote the relaxation of the international situation, and will not be able to get rid of the United States' ban. Until now - this is just one example - these bans are hindering us from recognizing the People's Republic of China, although this is what the entire French people are asking for.
    If this government intends to reconcile with the right wing, then it will not be able to effectively defend democratic freedom. This explains why the masses of the people are increasingly participating in the discussions on organizing a new government. Communist workers and Socialist workers are also increasingly expressing their willingness together, demanding the formation of a left-wing government supported by a parliamentary left-wing majority that does not exclude anyone. In the factories, workers with various opinions are issuing their calls in this direction. A continuous stream of petitions and many letters to the left-wing parties all demand the formation of a new Popular Front. Many Popular Front committees have been established, striving to see what happened in 1936 reappear in 1956. Today, everyone sees that France is awakening, and the strength of the workers and the masses of the people is being mobilized on a large scale. This strength will eventually defeat the reactionary forces' political tactics and the Socialist Party leaders' divisive tactics. 1956 has begun with a great victory for the working class and the people of the whole country. The reactionary forces are still trying to snatch this victory from the masses of the people. However, the masses of the people have become increasingly aware that they must unite and carry out new battles so that the victory of January 2 can be embodied in concrete facts.
    We face the future with confidence. The will of the people will surely prevail in the end.

    法国大选后的局势
    法国共产党中央委员会书记  雅克·杜克洛
    1月2日法国提前选举中最突出的事件是法国共产党在选举中取得的胜利。它一共获得5，622，879票，比1951年多了625，529票，为法国各政党之首。趋向于左翼的潮流是那么样的壮大，以至于不仅是共产党多得了票数，连社会党也多得了票数，甚至其他一些左翼的政治组织也多得了票数。如果社会党和激进党肯于采纳共产党向它们提出的建议，那末，通过选举而形成一个包括151名共产党议员及其同盟者的左翼多数派的胜利将更为巨大。
    在1951年选举中，由于多数联盟制的关系，我们党曾经被窃夺了好几十个议席。这一次，我们因为没有能够使大家把政党联盟制废止，所以向社会党和激进党提议，请它们同共产党结成联盟，以便把政党联盟制这一武器倒过来指向反动势力。如果共产党提出的这项建议获得采纳的话，那末，这3个政党就将取得40个省份的全部议席，从而使反动势力遭受非常沉重的损失。但是，由于政党联盟制的继续存在，由于反动党派广泛地加以利用，同时也由于社会党和激进党拒绝同共产党结成联盟，所以，反动派居然保持了一些原来很有可能失去的地位。
    法国共产党虽然得到了151个议席，但是还并没有得到废止了政党联盟制所应该得到的席位。实际上，它这一次还是被窃夺了37个议席。然而，官方的宣传机构毕竟不得不承认共产党胜利的巨大，因为共产党增加了50个议席，60多万选票。
    在这一次左翼获得胜利以后，法国工人阶级和全国人民所期待的是，成立一个左翼政府，并在议会中成立一个包括共产党议员在内的左翼多数。但是，这正是反动派最害怕的事情，因为他们并没有忘记1936年人民阵线的胜利。劳动人民对于新的人民阵线的前景越是感到欢欣鼓舞，反动派也就越加下决心用尽一切手段来阻挠这个经验的重现，因为人民群众对于往日的经验不仅记忆犹新，而且还由此而激发了巨大的希望。这就说明了为什么选举刚刚结束，反动派方面的人就主张由右翼各政党同包括社会党和孟戴斯—弗朗斯派的激进党人在内的“共和阵线”，成立一个联盟政府。
    前共和国总统、社会党人樊尚·阿里奥尔已经公开表示赞成这个向反动势力投降的办法，其直接后果无疑就是背弃社会党在最近的竞选运动中向人民许下的诺言，结果只会使经过普选所摈弃的右倾政策依然继续执行下去。但是，这样的主张是不容易使群众接受的，也正就是因为这个缘故，所以社会党的领导分子，一方面反对组成一个左翼政府，和包括共产党人在内的议会左翼多数，一方面却发起成立一个“共和阵线”的少数党政府。这样一个政府将不可避免地成为反动势力的俘虏，而反动势力则将用尽一切手段来阻挠议会，不让它通过符合于法国工人阶级和全国人民的期望和利益的措施。
    法国共产党始终信守它在选举前所发表的各项声明，始终愿意同社会党和其他共和团体取得协议，使法国能够有一个符合于人民群众所期望的政府，因此，它在1月7日向社会党和激进党提出了一项非常重要的建议，主张由三个政党（共产党、社会党、激进党）各派代表共同讨论成立政府和制定一个纲领的问题。根据共产党的看法，这个纲领应该首先包括以下几点：通过协商和平解决阿尔及利亚问题；改善城乡劳动人民的生活；实施“保卫非教会学校全国委员会”的最低纲领；坚决反对一切破坏活动；执行导致裁减军备和缓和国际局势的政策。共产党的这些主张，都是同法国工人阶级和全国人民群众的主张一致的。
    法国人民要求迅速解决阿尔及利亚问题，让参加阿尔及利亚战争的法国士兵早日回家。如果将来成立的政府竟由于社会党和激进党拒绝同共产党取得协议，而处于一种从属反动右翼的地位，那末，显而易见，阿尔及利亚问题的解决，不仅将因而耽搁下去，而且还会受到破坏。
    同样显而易见，如果将来成立的政府，妄想同反动势力和好相处，那末，那怕它不敢公然同反动派结成同盟，也还是会不可避免地受到反动派的压力，从而不能按照人民群众对它的期望，来改善人民的生活条件：增加工资、薪给、养老金和退休金；提高各不同职业的最低工资；取消使外省几百万劳动者受到损失的地区工资差额等等……
    同样地，政府只有坚决依靠包括共产党人在内的议会左翼多数，而对反动势力不存丝毫幻想，然后才有可能实施“保卫非教会学校全国委员会”的最低纲领，废除那些反对政教分离的法律，重新恢复学校的政教分离原则和国家的政教分离原则。
    同样毫无疑问，一个受右派操纵的政府，决不能对破坏企图采取坚决的行动。只有在工人阶级团结一致和一切民主力量团结一致的旗帜下，法西斯主义才会被彻底打垮。今天，法国固然没有像1934年那样的法西斯危机，企图在那一年的2月6日进行武装作乱来推翻民主自由，但是这并没有阻止冒险家布热德提出的候选人名单不仅是得到了商人和手工业者的选票，因为这些人对于损害他们的税制感到不满；而且还得到了一些戴高乐分子和贝当分子的选票。这就是说，共同有着法西斯倾向的反动分子都已经聚集在冒险家布热德的背后，并且怀有路人皆知其用心所在的一些计划。只有工人阶级团结一致进行斗争，只有一切左翼力量都团结起来，才能够挫败这些阴谋。
    如果将来的政府竟做了反动势力的俘虏，那末，毫无疑问，它也就不能够推行独立的外交政策，不能够采取有效的行动来促进国际局势的缓和，同时也就不能够摆脱美国的禁令。直到现在为止——这只是举一个例来说——这些禁令阻挠着我们承认中华人民共和国，虽然这是法国全体人民都要求的事情。
    这个政府如果存心想同右派和好相处，那末，它就连对民主自由也不能够进行有效的保卫，这就说明了为什么人民群众越来越参加到有关组织新政府的讨论中来。共产党工人和社会党工人也越来越多地在一起表示他们的意愿，要求成立一个左翼政府，以不排斥任何人的议会左翼多数为支柱。在工厂里面，抱有各种见解的工人，都朝着这一个方向发出他们的呼声。川流不息的请愿书，寄给左翼各政党的许许多多信件，都一律要求成立一个新的人民阵线。许许多多公教人员都要求成立左翼政府。很多人民阵线委员会已经建立起来，争取1936年所发生的事情重见于1956年。今天，大家都看到，法国正在觉醒过来，工人和人民群众的力量正在大规模发动起来，这种力量，最后一定会战胜反动势力的政客手段，和社会党领导分子的分化手段。1956年已经以工人阶级和全国人民的伟大胜利开始。反动势力还在想和人民群众抢夺这个胜利。但是，人民群众已经越来越意识到，必须团结起来进行新的战斗，使1月2日的胜利，再从具体事实中体现出来。
    我们满怀信心地面对着未来。人民的意志最后一定获得胜利。
