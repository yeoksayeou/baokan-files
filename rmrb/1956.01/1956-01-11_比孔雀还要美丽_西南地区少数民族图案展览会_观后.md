    More Beautiful Than a Peacock
    ——After Seeing the "Southwest China Ethnic Minorities Pattern Exhibition"
    Lei Guiyuan

    I once heard a legend, and some even turned it into a folk song. The gist of the legend is this: A clever Miao young man caught a beautiful peacock (some say it was a golden pheasant) on a hilltop. He gave it to his beloved – a beautiful girl. The girl happily used the patterns and colors of the peacock's feathers to make an embroidered dress. When she wore it, the beautiful girl was even more beautiful than the peacock.

    After seeing the "Southwest China Ethnic Minorities Pattern Exhibition," I naturally thought of this poetic legend.

    Yes, the people of our fraternal ethnic groups are clever, and their artistic creations are beautiful. An embroidered garment meticulously sewn by the women is not an ordinary piece of clothing, but an artwork created through years of hard work. Weaving, dyeing, braiding, and embroidery are all done by them. They learn embroidery from their mothers from a young age, and by the time they are teenagers, they begin to make wedding dresses and festive costumes, demonstrating their high level of artistic talent to beautify life. They wear their handmade beautiful clothes at festivals and various gatherings, which is no different from a public mutual observation, and can also be said to be a competition of artistic labor. This observation and competition, in turn, becomes an encouragement for them to improve their artistic creation.

    The artistic creation talents of the women of the fraternal ethnic groups are indeed remarkable. Whether they embroider, cross-stitch, or batik, they do not draw drafts on the cloth beforehand. Relying on their long-standing tradition, diligent training, and the skilled techniques they have developed, they create beautiful and moving images and patterns. They use the most familiar and meaningful things around them as the subject matter for their patterns. For example, images of pear blossoms, butterflies, fish, and birds are often varied and used to create exquisite patterns, and from these patterns, they express the fraternal ethnic groups' optimistic love of beauty and their yearning for a happy life. Their color matching ability is also very high. Generally, clothing worn for festivals and gatherings is mainly red and orange, while clothing worn for ordinary work is mainly blue and black. From this, we can also appreciate the meaning of the so-called unity of decoration and practicality.

    In the exhibition, in addition to the many colorful patterns, there are also some works, mostly expressed in blue and white, which look fresh and dazzling. The white patterns shine like silver filigree. This is batik, another artistic creation of the fraternal ethnic groups that deserves our attention. Although its color is simple, it is as beautiful and lovely as other patterned works such as embroidery. When used to decorate clothing, and combined with weaving and embroidery, it is like adding silver flowers to brocade, complementing each other perfectly.

    Batik is quite common among the fraternal ethnic groups in Southwest China. Generally, women can make it to decorate hats, straps, lapels, and skirt hems. They do not use rulers, let alone compasses, but draw freely. The lines are regular, smooth, and meticulous. One should truly marvel at their exquisite techniques. What tools do they use? Very simple, only three sizes of copper "wax flower knives." Using this tool to dip in molten wax, they draw like cross-stitch, according to the fabric pattern, counting the warp and weft yarns. They use the vertical and horizontal lines of the fabric and the diagonal lines of the fabric as the organizational basis for the composition of the pattern, and the arc lines, vortex lines, etc. are also based on squares, so that the square and round are matched neatly and orderly, resulting in a unique and beautiful style and effect. The dye is generally indigo. After dyeing, the wax is removed by boiling in hot water, and the waxed areas reveal white patterns. Although this batik also takes time to draw, it is much faster than embroidery. I think this durable and beautiful product can be appropriately organized for production and developed like cross-stitch and embroidery.

    Although this exhibition only partially introduces the patterns of ethnic minorities in Southwest China, it has aroused the interest and attention of our professional pattern designers due to its rich content and diverse forms. Yes, we should draw essence from the more beautiful and varied patterns of the fraternal ethnic groups than peacocks, in order to enrich and improve our pattern design.

    比孔雀还要美丽
    ——“西南地区少数民族图案展览会”观后——
    雷圭元
    曾经听过这么一个传说，有人还把它编成了一首民歌。传说的大意是这样：有一位聪敏的苗家小伙子，在山岗上捕获了一只美丽的孔雀（有的说是锦鸡），他把它送给心爱的情人——一位美丽的姑娘，姑娘喜欢地照着孔雀全身羽毛的花纹和色彩做成了一件绣衣，穿在身上，美丽的姑娘全身于是比孔雀还要美丽。
    看了“西南地区少数民族图案展览会”，很自然地使我想起了这个富有诗意的传说。
    是的，我们各兄弟民族的人民是聪敏的，他们的艺术创造是美丽的。妇女们精心缝制的一件绣衣，不是一件普通的衣服，而是经过多年的辛勤劳动而创造的艺术品。织、染、编带、绣花等都由她们自己一手完成。她们从小就在母亲身旁学绣，到十几岁的时候，就开始做嫁衣和节日的盛装，为美化生活而发挥了高度的艺术才能。她们把手制的美丽的服装，在节日和各种集会时穿起来，无异是一种公开的互相观摩，也可以说是一种艺术劳动的竞赛，这种观摩和竞赛，又成为她们提高艺术创作的一种鼓舞。
    各兄弟民族妇女们艺术创作的才能确是了不起的，她们刺绣、挑花或蜡染，都不预先在布上画稿，凭着她们长期相传、刻苦锻炼和钻研得来的熟练技巧，创作出美丽动人的形象和图案。她们把生活周围最熟悉的和最有意义的事物作为图案的素材。例如梨花、蝴蝶、鱼、鸟等等形象，都经常被加以变化而构成精美的图案，并且从这些图案中，表现了兄弟民族爱美的乐观的感情和对于幸福生活的向往。她们配色的才能也是很高的，一般在节日和集会场合穿的服装以红、橙色为主，在平常工作的时候穿的，则以青、黑色为主。我们从这里也可以体会所谓装饰和实用的一致性的意义。
    在展览会中，除了色彩绚丽的许多图案之外，还有一部分作品，多数是以蓝白两色来表现的，看去清新耀目，白色的花纹像银质的盘丝一样闪闪发光。这就是蜡染，也是值得我们注意的兄弟民族的艺术创造。虽然它的色彩单纯，却同刺绣等其他图案作品一样的美丽可爱，用来装饰在服装上，同编织、刺绣配置在一起，简直像锦绣上添了银花，可说是相得益彰。
    蜡染在西南各兄弟民族中是相当普遍的，一般妇女都会制作，用来装饰帽子、背带、衣襟和裙边。她们不用直尺，更不用圆规，信手画来，线条规矩、流利、一丝不苟，真应该惊叹她们技术的精到。究竟她们使用的是什么工具呢？很简单，只有大中小三种铜质的“蜡花刀”。用这种工具醮着溶蜡，像挑花那样，根据布纹，数着经纬纱线来画，以布纹的纵横和布幅的对角线作为图案纹样构成的组织基础，弧线、涡线等也以方格为准绳，做到方圆配搭整齐，有条不紊，产生了独特的优美的风格和效果。染料一般用蓝靛，染色后再用热水煮去蜡质，涂蜡的地方就显出了白色的花纹。这种蜡染，画起来虽然也费时，但是比起刺绣来要快得多，我认为这种耐用而又美观的产品，可以适当地组织生产，像挑花、刺绣一样加以发展。
    这一次展览，虽然只是部分地介绍了西南地区少数民族的图案，但是由于内容丰富，形式多样，已引起了我们研究图案设计的专业人员的兴趣和重视。是的，我们应当从兄弟民族的比孔雀还要美丽而富有变化的图案中吸取精华，以丰富和提高我们的图案设计。
