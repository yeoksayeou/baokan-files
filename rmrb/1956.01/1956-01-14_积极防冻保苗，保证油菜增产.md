Actively Prevent Frost and Protect Seedlings to Ensure Increased Rapeseed Production
Zhang Zhiyuan

During the rapeseed sowing in 1955, many areas were affected by drought and flooding, which delayed the sowing period. In addition, soil compaction, poor land preparation, and large soil clods resulted in uneven emergence and weak seedlings, with many missing seedlings. In Hubei Province, about 50% of the rapeseed was planted hastily due to drought, with missing seedlings reaching about 20%, and in severe cases, more than 50%. Similar situations exist in Sichuan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and other provinces. If these areas suffer frost damage again, rapeseed production will inevitably be severely reduced. Therefore, actively preventing frost and protecting seedlings to safely overwinter is an important measure to ensure increased rapeseed production this year.

Timely application of winter fertilizer can promote rapeseed seedling growth, increase soil temperature, and enhance the ability of rapeseed to resist cold and overwinter. Before the ground freezes in winter, fertilizer should be applied as universally as possible. The amount of fertilizer is generally one or two dan of plant ash, 15 to 20 dan of cattle manure, compost, sod, lake grass, or 100 to 200 dan of river mud per mu. The fertilizer should be applied around the base of the seedlings and covered with soil by clearing ditches and cultivating soil to avoid fertilizer loss.

Clearing ditches and furrows can promptly drain standing water from the field, allowing rapeseed to grow safely under favorable conditions and improve cold resistance. If the soil moisture content is too high, freezing and icing can easily cause mechanical damage and disrupt root development. After the rapeseed ridges freeze, the soil loosens, and the soil on the edge of the ridges easily collapses into the bottom of the ditches, hindering drainage and causing waterlogging. Therefore, in areas with more rainfall, it is necessary to check regularly and clear the ditches and furrows in time to achieve deep ditches and high ridges, ensuring no standing water in the field. The soil dug up from the bottom of the ditches should be cultivated around the plants, with the cultivated soil being slightly higher on the north side and lower on the south side to receive sunlight and reduce cold wind exposure.

Pressing the roots after frost can reduce frost damage losses. After rapeseed is affected by frost, the topsoil loosens, and the soil around the roots heaves, making it susceptible to cold wind and causing dehydration, wilting, and death; especially in the case of soil freezing and thawing repeatedly, the mortality rate will be even higher. According to the inspection by the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture, in Wangcheng Township, Xishui County, the death of 90% of the rapeseed seedlings in two agricultural production cooperatives was mainly due to the roots being heaved. Therefore, after rapeseed is affected by frost, it is necessary to press the soil around the roots tightly in time to make the roots closely contact the soil, which can greatly reduce frost damage.

In areas with earlier sowing and areas with higher winter temperatures, rapeseed often bolts and flowers before spring. This significantly reduces the cold resistance of rapeseed; if the temperature drops sharply, it is prone to frost damage. Therefore, when premature bolting of rapeseed is detected, the flower spikes should be removed as early as possible to slightly injure the plant mechanically, disperse nutrients, and inhibit the growth of the main stem. The spike removal work should be carried out on sunny days to avoid rotting of the wounds. After spike removal, fertilizer should also be applied once to promote branching and increase yield.

In areas where insect pests occur, timely prevention and control should be carried out with 0.5% "666" powder and other pesticides.

    积极防冻保苗，保证油菜增产
    张止渊
    1955年播种油菜的时候，很多地区受旱、涝影响，播种期推迟，再加上土壤板结、整地质量差，土壤坷垃大，出苗不整齐，因此幼苗瘦弱，缺苗很多。湖北省有50％左右的油菜是抗旱抢种的，缺苗达20％左右，严重的在50％以上。四川、安徽、浙江等省也有类似情况。这些地区，若再遭冻害，油菜必然严重减产。因此，积极防冻，保护幼苗安全越冬，是保证今年油菜增产的重要措施。
    及时追施腊肥，可以促进油菜幼苗生长，增加土温，提高油菜抗寒越冬能力。冬季在封冻前，应尽可能普遍追肥一次。施肥数量一般每亩用草木灰一、二担，牛栏粪、堆肥、草皮、湖草等肥15至20担或河泥一、二百担。肥料要施在幼苗基部四周，并且结合清沟培土把肥料盖好，避免肥料流失。
    清理沟畦，可以及时排清田中积水，使油菜能够在有利的条件下安全生长，提高抗寒能力。假若土壤含水量过多，受冻结冰后，容易造成机械损伤，破坏根系发育。油菜畦面受冻后，土壤疏松，畦边泥土容易倒塌在沟底，排水不畅，引起涝灾。因此，在雨水较多的地区，要随时检查，及时清理沟畦，作到深沟高畦，田无积水；沟底撬起的泥土，要培在植株四周，使培成的土壤，北面稍高，南面较低，以便接受阳光，减少寒风侵袭。
    冻后压根，可以减轻冻害损失。油菜受冻后，表土松动，根部土壤掀耸，易受寒风影响，并且发生脱水枯干死亡现象；特别是在土壤一冻一溶、溶后再冻的情况下，冻死率会更大。根据湖北省农业厅检查，浠水县望城乡两个农业生产合作社油菜受冻后，有90％的菜苗的死亡多是因为根系掀起。因此，油菜受冻后，要及时压紧根部土壤，使根部和土壤密接，这样可以大大减轻冻害。
    在播种较早的地区和冬季气温较高的地区，春前往往有油菜抽苔开花的现象。这样，油菜的抗寒力就会显著降低；如果气温骤降，就容易遭受冻害。因此，在发现油菜提前抽苔的时候，要及早摘去苔尖，使植株略受机械损伤，养份分散，抑制主茎生长。摘苔工作应该在晴天进行，以免伤口腐烂。摘苔后还要追肥一次，以促进生长分枝，增加产量。
    发生虫害的地区，要及时用0.5％的“六六六”粉剂等药剂进行防治。
