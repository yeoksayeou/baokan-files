　　Give Us Time to Rest and Manage Household Chores

    Editor's Note: A young female member of the Communist Youth League from a certain organization wrote to us, reflecting that the leaders of the organization have not properly arranged work and study, so that female staff members cannot get the rest time they deserve and the time to manage household chores. Although the writer did not specify her name and the name of the organization, according to our understanding, this phenomenon does exist to varying degrees in some organizations. The appeal in the letter truly represents the common opinion of the vast majority of staff members, especially female staff members, in these organizations. Therefore, we are publishing this letter in the hope that all organizations where this phenomenon exists will pay attention and reasonably arrange work, study, and meeting times.

　　Dear Editor:

    I am a young female member of the Communist Youth League, a staff member of an organization. I hope to appeal through the newspaper: the leaders of the organization should properly arrange work and meetings to ensure that female comrades can get the rest time they deserve and the time to manage household chores.

    From the National Day of 1955 to the present, these three months, our spare time has not been guaranteed at all. Our organization is usually busy until 10 o'clock in the evening, or even after 11 or 12 o'clock. In the recent three months, because the Youth League branch organized everyone to study, we have meetings every Sunday, which makes everyone exhausted. Many female comrades have opinions, but no one dares to say a word. One comrade has children at home, and occasionally mentioned that she wanted to make cotton shoes for her children at home on Sunday, and was considered "backward." "If you can't even sacrifice your Sunday rest, what kind of League member are you?" This inappropriate criticism made others afraid to express their opinions.

    Here I will only talk about my own situation. I am 26 years old and have three children. I get home after 10 o'clock every night, wash my face, wash my feet, and then take a child from the nanny to bed, and it's already 11 o'clock. As soon as I fall asleep, the child needs to pee, and I have to get up again. In the morning, the children wake up at six o'clock, and I have to get up with them. I often only get six hours of sleep. On Saturday, I was in charge of the organization's party, and didn't get home until 12 o'clock at night. I should rest on Sunday, but for the past three months, every Sunday I have had a meeting from 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Although I can rest at home in the afternoon, because I don't have time to wash my hair on weekdays, I don't have time to bathe my children, I don't have time to arrange the children's lives for the nanny, and I don't even have time to mend socks or wash underwear. These things are all squeezed into Sunday, and as a result, Sunday is even more tiring. In this way, I don't get enough rest, my body is in bad shape, I can't concentrate on my work, and it has a greater impact on family life.

    My three children, the oldest is five years old, and the youngest has just been weaned. During the day when I am not at home, the children are all taken care of by the nanny; when I get home at night, the children are all asleep. My eldest child is very lively. I used to take him to the park to slide and play on the seesaw, and he was very happy; but in the past three months, I have to go to meetings every Sunday, and there is no chance to take the children out to the park. Every time on Sunday, he sees the children living in the same courtyard being taken out to play by their mothers, he says: "When will I go play on the seesaw!" As a mother, I feel very sorry for my child! It's getting cold, the children don't have sweaters, my husband bought the wool, but I don't have time to knit sweaters for the children.

    My husband is also a staff member of an organization, and he is usually busy too, but he is considerate of me. On Sundays, the nanny needs to rest, so he goes to buy groceries himself, buying a week's worth of rice, flour, oil, etc. Sunday has also become a burden for him.

    My appeal to you like this is not to say that I value family life and housework more than work and building socialism. I am not a "family first" advocate. I am willing to contribute my strength to the cause of socialism. However, I think I should also fulfill my responsibilities to my children as a mother, and my responsibilities to my husband as a wife. I think that the leaders of the organization should consider the actual difficulties of female comrades when arranging work, meetings and other activities!

    I hope the editor will raise this issue publicly and draw the attention of the leaders. Because I think that such problems exist to varying degrees in many organizations.

### 给我们休息时间和料理家务的时间

　　给我们休息时间和料理家务的时间
    编者按：某机关一个女青年团员来信，反映机关领导方面没有妥善地安排工作和学习，以致使女工作人员不能得到应有的休息时间和料理家务的时间。虽然来信者没有写明本人姓名和机关名称，但是据我们了解，这种现象在一部分机关中确实是程度不等地存在着的。来信中的呼吁，确实代表了这些机关里的广大工作人员，特别是女工作人员的共同意见。因此，我们把这封来信发表出来，希望所有存在着这种现象的机关都能引起注意，合理地安排工作、学习和会议的时间。
　　编辑同志：
    我是一个女青年团员，一个机关工作人员。我希望通过报纸呼吁一下：机关领导方面应该妥善地安排工作和会议，保证女同志能够得到应有的休息时间和料理家务的时间。
    从1955年国庆节到现在这三个月时间中，我们的业余时间根本得不到保证。我们这个机关平常时候每天都忙到晚上10点钟，甚至11点、12点以后。最近这三个月，因为团支部组织大家学习，每星期天都开会，弄得大家精疲力尽。许多女同志有意见，可是谁也不敢说一声。有位同志家里有孩子，偶尔提了一下星期天在家要给孩子做双棉鞋，便被认为是“落后”。“连牺牲星期休息的事都做不到，还算什么团员？”这种不恰当的批评，使得别人也不敢再提意见了。
    这里我只谈谈我自己的情况。我26岁，有三个孩子。我每天晚上10点钟以后回家，洗洗脸、洗洗脚，再从保姆那里领一个孩子上床，已经11点了。刚睡下去，孩子要撒尿，又得起来。早上，孩子六点就醒了，也得跟着起来。我经常只能睡六小时。星期六，我负责机关晚会，夜里12点才回家。星期日应该休息了，可是最近三个月来，每个星期日都是上午8点开会，一直开到12点半。尽管下午可以在家休息，可是由于平常没有时间洗头发，没有时间替孩子洗澡，没有时间给保姆安排孩子的生活，甚至没有时间补补袜子、洗洗衬裤。这些事都挤在星期天去做，结果，星期天更累人。这样，我得不到充分的休息，身体弄得很坏，工作时注意力不集中，对家庭生活影响更大。
    我的三个孩子，大的已经五岁了，小的才断奶。白天我不在家，孩子都交给保姆；晚上回家，孩子都睡了。我的大孩子很活泼，以前我曾经带他到公园去滑滑梯、玩翘翘板，他很高兴；可是最近三个月，每星期我要开会，带孩子出去到公园走走的机会也没有了。每次星期天他看到同院住的孩子由母亲带出去玩，就说：“我什么时候去玩翘翘板啊！”作为一个母亲，我感到很对不起孩子！天冷了，孩子没有毛衣，我丈夫把绒线买来了，我没有时间替孩子织毛衣。
    我丈夫也是机关工作者，他平常也忙，但是对我是体谅的。星期日，保姆需要休息，于是他自己去买菜，买一个星期吃的米、面、油等等。星期天对于他也成了负担。
    我这样向您申诉，并不是说我把家庭生活和家务劳动看得比工作、比建设社会主义还重要。我并不是“家庭至上”主义者。我愿意在社会主义事业中贡献自己的力量。但是，我认为我也应该在家庭中尽一个母亲对孩子的责任，尽一个妻子对丈夫的责任。我认为，机关领导方面在安排工作、会议和其他活动的时候，是应该考虑一下女同志的实际困难的！
    我希望编辑同志把这个问题公开提出来，引起领导同志的注意。因为我认为，这样的问题，在不少机关是程度不等地普遍存在着的。
