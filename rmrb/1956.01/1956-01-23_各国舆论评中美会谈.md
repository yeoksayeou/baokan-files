International Opinion on Sino-U.S. Talks

*Democratic Korea*

The *Democratic Korea* published a commentary on January 21 regarding the U.S. delay of the Sino-U.S. talks, stating that the statement issued by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on January 18, irrefutably exposed the fact that the United States was obstructing the Sino-U.S. talks from reaching an agreement on the second item on the agenda.

The commentary pointed out that the U.S. proposal to renounce the use of force on the condition of recognizing the U.S.'s "defense rights" in the Taiwan area is, in fact, demanding that China recognize the U.S.'s occupation of China's territory Taiwan and demanding that China abandon the exercise of its sovereignty to liberate Taiwan. The 600 million Chinese people will never accept such shameless demands from the imperialists.

The commentary concluded that the Korean people fully support China's efforts and the position it has taken in the Sino-U.S. talks.

*Hindustan Standard*

The *Hindustan Standard* published an editorial on the 21st stating, "The meetings between the Chinese and American ambassadors in Geneva have been dragging on since last August," and "If Dulles persists in his 'brink of war' diplomacy, then they are unlikely to make any progress."

The editorial pointed out: "America's uncompromising attitude towards the People's Republic of China is neither beneficial nor reasonable."

"America's stubborn policy disappoints its friends and allies; more unfortunately, it gives Asian countries that do not participate in either side a colder and more alienated feeling."

The editorial welcomed China's renewed proposal to hold a meeting between the foreign ministers of China and the United States to resolve the Far East disputes, and said that this request "makes Dulles' stubborn attitude even worse."

British Public Opinion

Political figures in London and some British newspapers attach great importance to the news that the Sino-U.S. talks are being delayed due to the fault of the United States.

*The Times* editorial said that during the talks, the Chinese representative suggested resolving the issue of lifting the embargo and preparing for a meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the United States.

Referring to the issue of Western countries establishing normal trade relations with China, the newspaper emphasized that this issue is related to the interests of many countries, which are increasingly demanding a revision of the embargo. Regarding the suggestion of holding a meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the United States, *The Times* said that this suggestion has been supported by some political figures outside of China, "and others may follow their example." The newspaper said: "The issue of China's position in the United Nations is undoubtedly more pressing this year than last year."

A reporter from *The Scotsman* also talked about Britain's reaction to the delay of the Sino-U.S. talks. When discussing the attitude of British political figures towards the situation in the Taiwan area, the reporter avoided mentioning the basic issue that Taiwan Island is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, but he believed that Britain cannot support the actions of some people in the United States who are aggravating the tension in the region. He said: "Britain must not help the United States" in military operations on the Chinese coastal islands. The reporter wrote: "The British Foreign Office is uneasy about the current state of the Sino-U.S. talks in Geneva."

    各国舆论评中美会谈
    “民主朝鲜报”
    “民主朝鲜报”1月21日就美国拖延中美会谈发表评论说，中华人民共和国外交部发言人1月18日发表的关于中美会谈的声明，无可辩驳地揭露了美国阻挠中美会谈就第二项议程达成协议的事实。
    评论指出，美国提出的在承认美国在台湾地区有“防御权利”的条件下放弃使用武力的主张，实际上是要求中国承认美国强占中国领土台湾，要求中国放弃行使解放台湾的主权。六亿中国人民是决不会接受帝国主义者的这种无耻的要求的。
    评论最后说，朝鲜人民完全支持中国在中美会谈中所作的努力和采取的立场。
    “印度斯坦旗报”
    “印度斯坦旗报”21日发表社论说，“中美两国大使在日内瓦举行的会议自从去年8月以来一直在拖延着”，“如果杜勒斯坚持他的‘战争边缘’外交的话，那么他们绝不可能取得任何进展。”
    社论指出：“美国对中华人民共和国所抱的不妥协态度既没有益处也不合情理。”
    “美国顽固的政策使得它的朋友和盟国感到失望；更加不幸的是，它使得不参加任何一方的亚洲国家有着更加冷淡和疏远的感觉。”
    社论对于中国再度提出举行中美两国外长级会议来解决远东纠纷的要求表示欢迎，并且说，这个要求“使得杜勒斯的顽固态度显得更加恶劣。”
    英国舆论
    伦敦政界人士和一些英国报纸十分重视中美会谈由于美国的罪咎而拖延的消息。
    “泰晤士报”的社论说，在会谈过程中，中国代表建议解决取消禁运的问题和准备中美外交部长会议的问题。
    谈到西方国家同中国建立正常贸易关系的问题时，报纸着重指出，这个问题关系到许多国家的利益，它们日益要求修改禁运。谈到举行中美外交部长会议的建议时，“泰晤士报”说，这个建议受到中国以外一些政界人士的支持，“其他一些人士也可能仿效他们。”这家报纸说：“中国在联合国的地位问题，今年无疑比去年更为紧迫。”
    “苏格兰人报”的记者也谈到英国对中美会谈受到拖延的反应。这个报纸的记者在谈到英国政界人士对台湾地区局势的态度的时候，对台湾岛是中国领土不可分割的一部分这一基本问题避而不谈，不过他认为英国不能支持美国某些人士加剧这个地区的紧张局势的做法，他说：“英国决不能帮助美国”在中国沿海岛屿进行军事行动。记者写道：“英国外交部对日内瓦中美会谈的现状感到不安。
