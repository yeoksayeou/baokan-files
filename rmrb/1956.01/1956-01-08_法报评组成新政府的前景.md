Xinhua News Agency, January 7th -- According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on January 6th: Parisian newspaper commentators are discussing the situation emerging after the National Assembly elections and the prospects for forming the future government. The new National Assembly should convene on January 19th (according to the constitution, on the third Thursday after the election), after which the current government should resign.

　　Parisian newspapers are paying attention to the fact that the largest faction in the National Assembly is the Communist Party's faction. The second largest faction is the alliance of the Radical Socialist Party, the Socialist Party, and some other parties – the so-called "Republican Front."

　　The leaders of this alliance, the Socialist Mollet and the Radical Socialist Mendes-France, have indicated that they want to form a government alone, without the participation of the right-wing parties that joined the current government alliance.

　　At the same time, the leaders of the "Republican Front" are also neglecting the possibility of forming a stable left-wing government with the participation of representatives from left-wing groups such as the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Radical Socialist Party.

　　The leaders of the "Republican Front" have expressed their intention to strive to resolve the Algerian issue, abolish subsidies to private (church) schools, and make new amendments to the electoral law in order to establish the pre-war single-member constituency majority voting system, which is particularly beneficial to Radical Socialists and Socialists.

　　This faction believes that the "Republican Front" government can exist for a period of time, relying sometimes on the support of left-wing forces and sometimes on the support of right-wing parties on other issues.

　　"Le Figaro" once again called on the leaders of the "Republican Front" to reconcile with the right-wing parties. "Les Échos" expressed the same opinion. On the other hand, progressive newspapers are calling for the establishment of a People's Front government. "Libération" asked: "When will Mollet, Mendes-France, and Thorez hold talks?" Bourdieu emphasized in the weekly "France Observateur" that "the center of gravity in the National Assembly has shifted to the left," and the leaders of the "Republican Front" should not adopt an anti-communist stance.

### 法报评组成新政府的前景

　　法报评组成新政府的前景
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社巴黎6日讯：巴黎报纸的评论员在讨论国民议会选举后出现的形势和组成未来的政府的前景。新的国民议会应当在1月19日开会（根据宪法是在选举后的第三个星期四），随后，现政府就应辞职。
    巴黎报纸注意这一事实：国民议会中最大的党团是共产党的党团。第二大党团是激进社会党、社会党和其他一些党派的联盟——所谓“共和阵线”。
    这个联盟的领袖社会党人摩勒和激进社会党人孟戴斯—弗朗斯表示要单独组织政府，而不让加入目前的政府联盟的右翼党派参加。
    “共和阵线”的领袖们同时又忽视在目前有可能组成一个有共产党、社会党、激进社会党等左翼团体的代表参加的稳定的左翼政府。
    “共和阵线”的领导者表示打算争取解决阿尔及利亚问题，取消给私立（教会）学校的补助金，对选举法进行新的修改，以便建立战前的小选区多数投票制，这一制度对激进社会党人和社会党人特别有利。
    这一派人认为，“共和阵线”政府能够存在一个时期，它有时可以依靠左翼力量的支持，有时在其他问题上可以依靠右翼政党的支持。
    “费加罗报”再次呼吁“共和阵线”的领导者同右翼政党和好。“回声报”表示了同样的意见。另一方面，进步报纸要求建立人民阵线的政府。“解放报”问道：“摩勒、孟戴斯—弗朗斯和多列士什么时候举行会谈呢？”布尔戴在“法兰西观察家”周刊上着重指出，“国民议会中的重心已经向左转”，“共和阵线”的领袖不应该采取反共的立场。
