Gosh Publishes Article to Celebrate Indian National Day

The General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, Gosh, published an article in the latest issue of the "New Century" weekly, celebrating the 6th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of India.

Gosh said, "The past year has been of great significance. In this year, we have not only consolidated the friendly relations with the People's China, but also established the Bandung spirit on the basis of this unbreakable friendship. The epoch-making visit of the Indian Prime Minister to the great socialist country and the return visit of the leaders of the Soviet people to our Republic have further strengthened this spirit."

Gosh further pointed out that despite the pressure exerted by the imperialists, India has consolidated its hard-won freedom and given it the important position it deserves as one of the world's major powers today. He said that by expanding its fraternal friendly relations with the socialist world, India has begun to recognize who its true friends are.

Gosh said that freedom is solid and complete only when national industrialization is strengthened. He welcomed the draft of the Second Five-Year Plan, which, despite its limitations, "is a meaningful step in the right direction."

He added that the economic assistance offered to India by socialist countries in the form of basic construction materials and long-term loans will help India reduce its dependence on imperialist monopoly capital. Gosh said, "On the 6th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of India, the Communist Party will devote itself to the struggle for national unity, which is a reliable guarantee for India to move forward with dignity."

Drafting the Second Five-Year Plan

The two-day meeting of the Indian National Development Council concluded on January 21st. The meeting discussed the draft of the Second Five-Year Plan.

Minister of Commerce and Industry, Krishnamachari, said that by the beginning of the Third Five-Year Plan, India would be able to produce 60% to 70% of the machinery it needed. He also said that if the current plan could be implemented, India could obtain 1 million tons of steel from the Soviet Union without using foreign exchange. According to the plan, the Soviet Union would purchase Indian goods currently exported and certain other items.

The National Development Council approved the Planning Commission's recommendation to allocate 48 billion rupees to the state-owned economic sector under the Second Five-Year Plan. The National Development Council recommended increasing the number of employed people domestically by 10 million. The National Development Council pointed out that if corresponding conditions for increasing employment are not created, unemployment will be more acute than it is now.

The National Development Council emphasized the necessity of large-scale development of cooperative undertakings, especially in agriculture and small-scale industries. The National Development Council approved the recommendations made earlier by its Standing Committee on land reform policies, which included: promoting cooperative farming and cooperative villages, reducing land rent, implementing a method of progressively decreasing compensation, and stipulating a maximum limit for land ownership.

    印度共和国成立6周年
    高士发表文章庆祝印度国庆
    印度共产党总书记高士在最近一期“新世纪”周报上发表文章，庆祝印度共和国成立6周年国庆。
    高士说，“过去一年具有重大的意义。在这一年中我们不仅巩固了同人民中国的友好关系，而且还在这种牢不可破的友谊的基础上建立了万隆精神。印度总理到伟大的社会主义国家去的划时代的访问和苏联人民领袖到我们共和国来的答访，更加强了这种精神。”
    高士进一步指出，尽管帝国主义者施加了压力，印度已经巩固了它的得来不易的自由，并且使它得到了它所应得的作为今天世界大国之一的重要地位。他说，由于扩大了同社会主义世界的兄弟般的友好关系，印度已经开始认识到谁是它的真正的朋友。
    高士说，只有在国家工业化得到加强的时候，自由才是稳固而完全的。他欢迎第二个五年计划草案，这个草案尽管有它的限制，但是“是朝着正确的方向前进了有意义的一步。”
    他又说，社会主义国家以基本建设物资和长期贷款向印度提出的经济援助将帮助印度减少它对帝国主义垄断资本的依赖。高士说，“在印度共和国成立6周年的时候，共产党将致力于争取实现全国团结的斗争，这种团结是印度庄严地向前迈进的一个可靠的保证。”
    制定第二个五年计划草案
    印度国家开发委员会所举行的两天会议已经在1月21日闭幕。会议讨论了第二个五年计划的草案。
    工商部长克里希纳马查里说，印度到第三个五年计划开始时能够生产印度所需要的机器的60％到70％。他还说，如果能够实行现在所制定的计划，印度就可以从苏联获得100万吨钢而不必动用外汇，根据这个计划，苏联将向印度购买印度现在出口的商品和除此以外的某些东西。
    国家开发委员会通过了计划委员会提出的关于根据第二个五年计划在国营经济部分拨款480亿卢比的建议。国家开发委员会建议在国内增加就业人数1，000万人。国家开发委员会指出，如果不为增加就业人数创造相应的条件，那么失业的情况将比现在更加尖锐。
    国家开发委员会着重指出了大规模发展合作事业，特别是农业方面和小型工业方面的合作事业的必要性，国家开发委员会赞成它的常务委员会早些时候在土地改革政策方面提出的建议，这些建议包括：推广合作耕作和合作村庄，减低地租、实行补偿递减的办法和规定拥有土地的最高限额。（附图片）
