Anyang County Succeeds in Trial Planting of Three Crops a Year of Grain and Vegetables

    The agricultural production cooperative led by Dong Yisheng of Qianxigang Village, Xuxiang Township, Anyang County, Henan Province, responded to the call of the Anyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China to expand the area of multiple cropping. Last year, it experimented with the "three crops a year of grain and vegetables" planting method on 17 mu of land in the cooperative. In mid-June, the members harvested wheat and planted corn on the 17 mu of wheat stubble land; in early September, when the corn ripened, the members immediately deep-plowed, fertilized, and planted white radishes. The radishes grew very well. When it came time to plant wheat in the Autumn Equinox, the members sowed wheat in the radish rows. The green shoots in the radish field grew more luxuriantly than in other fields. After harvesting the radishes, the members calculated: the 17 mu of land yielded an average of 210 jin of wheat, 280 jin of corn, and 3,000 jin of radishes per mu. In addition to not affecting the increase in grain production in the wheat and autumn seasons, the net increase in income was 60 yuan per mu.

　　安阳县粮菜一年三熟试种成功
    河南省安阳县许西乡前西岗村董宜生领导的农业生产合作社，去年响应中共安阳县委扩大复播面积的号召，在社内17亩地上试验了“粮菜一年三熟”的耕种方法。6月中旬，社员们收割完小麦，在17亩麦荏地上种上玉米；9月初旬，玉米熟了，社员们收完玉米马上深耕、施肥，种上白萝卜。萝卜生长得很好。到秋分种麦的时候，社员们又在萝卜行中播上了小麦。萝卜地里的青苗长得比其他地里的还茂盛。收完萝卜以后，社员们算了一笔账：17亩地每亩平均收小麦210斤，玉米280斤，萝卜三千斤。除不影响麦秋两季粮食增产外，每亩净增加收入60元。
