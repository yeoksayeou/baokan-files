Xinhua News Agency, 6th - The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China today answered questions from Xinhua News Agency reporters regarding the Sino-US talks. The full text is as follows:

Q: The ambassadorial talks between China and the United States, which began in Geneva on August 1, 1955, have entered a new year. What is the progress of the talks?

A: On September 10, 1955, the two sides reached an agreement on the first item on the agenda, "The repatriation of civilians by both sides." After this, the Chinese side immediately raised two issues under the second item on the agenda: lifting the embargo and preparing for a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting to discuss and ease tensions between China and the United States in the Taiwan area. These are practical issues of concern to the world that are in dispute between China and the United States and should be dealt with quickly. The United States raised the issue of so-called "renunciation of the use of force." If this means that China and the United States should peacefully resolve their disputes without resorting to force, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, then there is no reason why this issue cannot be resolved quickly. However, the Sino-US talks have been discussing the second item on the agenda for nearly four months without reaching any agreement. This situation is unsatisfactory.

Q: The US State Department said in a statement on December 16, 1955, that the agreement on the first item on the agenda "does not distinguish between the two categories of people, those in prison and those not in prison." Is there any basis for this statement?

A: This is a distortion of the agreement and has no basis whatsoever. Americans who have broken the law in China are fundamentally different from law-abiding American residents in China. If the special circumstances of Americans who have broken the law were not taken into account, there would be no need for a provision in the agreement stating that they can exercise their right to return home as soon as the Chinese government takes measures. In fact, at the beginning of the Sino-US talks, the Chinese side submitted to the US side a list of all Americans in China, clearly distinguishing between general American residents and Americans who had broken the law. Americans who have broken the law in China must be dealt with in accordance with Chinese legal procedures, and there can be no deadline for the release of Americans who have broken the law; moreover, they have no right to demand to return home during their imprisonment. Only when their sentences have expired or China has taken measures to release them early can the issue of exercising their right to return home be further discussed. As for what measures China takes in accordance with its own legal procedures and when it takes measures against those people, that is China's sovereignty and cannot be interfered with by other countries. All this is not only recognized by the US side in the talks, but also stipulated in the agreement. During the Sino-US talks, the Chinese side has already taken measures to release 27 of the 40 Americans who broke the law. According to the crimes committed and the sentences imposed on these 27 Americans who broke the law, their return home could not be faster. However, the US side not only refused to hand over the list of Chinese people imprisoned in the United States, but also has not yet taken any measures against any Chinese people imprisoned in the United States to enable them to exercise their right to return home as soon as possible.

Q: Recently, newspapers have published letters from the families of Chinese students in the United States accusing the US government of obstructing their relatives from returning home. Since the Sino-US talks have reached an agreement on the repatriation of civilians by both sides, why are Chinese people in the United States still unable to return home?

A: These actions of the US government are sufficient proof that it is the United States itself that is violating the Sino-US agreement on the repatriation of civilians. The US government has long used threats and persecution to prevent innocent Chinese people from returning home; this is something the US government has openly admitted. Now, after the agreement has been reached, the US side has not only failed to take appropriate measures to enable Chinese people in the United States to return home as soon as possible, not only refused to provide us with a complete list and information of Chinese people in the United States, but also refused to assist the Indian Embassy in the United States in actively investigating the fact that Chinese people in the United States are being prevented from leaving the country. Recently, the US government has taken further threatening measures against Chinese people in the United States, stipulating that Chinese students must obtain a Taiwan entry permit if they want to reside temporarily in the United States. This is a blatant violation of the agreement and an attempt to deprive Chinese people in the United States of their right to return to their motherland. We have lodged a serious protest with the US side, firmly demanding that the US side provide a complete list and information of Chinese people in the United States, fully implement the agreement between the two sides, and revoke the regulations that violate the agreement.

Q: What is the future development of the Sino-US talks?

A: China is participating in the Sino-US talks in order to resolve the disputes between China and the United States and to ease the tense relations between China and the United States. In the five months of talks, the two sides have been discussing the second item on the agenda for nearly four months, but no agreement has been reached. Moreover, the time for adjournments is getting longer and longer. Obviously, this situation could not have arisen if one side had not deliberately delayed it.

The Chinese side has made repeated efforts to seek an agreement on the second item on the agenda. However, any agreement must be reached through the efforts of both sides. If one side continues to make efforts to seek an agreement, while the other side's actions are completely in the opposite direction, the talks cannot achieve any results. The issues currently being discussed in the Sino-US talks are closely related to the easing of the situation in the Far East. The Chinese side will continue to work to seek an agreement, but the Chinese people will not agree to the Sino-US talks being dragged on for a long time.

### 外交部发言人就有关中美会谈问题答记者

　　外交部发言人就有关中美会谈问题答记者
    新华社6日讯　中华人民共和国外交部发言人今天就有关中美会谈问题答新华社记者问，全文如下：
    问：1955年8月1日开始的在日内瓦举行的中美两国大使级的会谈已经进入了新的一年；请问会谈的进展情况如何？
    答：在1955年9月10日，会谈双方已经对第一项议程“双方平民回国问题”达成了协议。在这以后，中国方面立即在第二项议程下提出了取消禁运和准备中美外长会议来讨论和缓和消除中美在台湾地区的紧张局势的两项议题。这些都是举世关心的中美双方有所争执的实际问题，应该迅速得到处理。美国方面提出了所谓“放弃使用武力”的问题。如果这是说，中美两国应该根据联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，和平解决彼此间的争端而不诉诸武力，那么，这个问题也没有理由不能迅速得到解决。但是，中美会谈对第二项议程的讨论已经进行了将近四个月，没有能够取得任何协议。这种情况是不能令人满意的。
    问：美国国务院在1955年12月16日的声明中说，关于第一项议程的协议“对于在监狱中和不在监狱中的两类人，没有作任何区分”。这种说法有没有任何根据？
    答：这是对协议的歪曲，是没有任何根据的。在中国的犯法美国人同在中国的守法美侨是根本不同的。如果不是考虑到犯法美国人的特殊情况，协议中就不必作出只有在中国政府采取措施之后，他们才能尽速行使回国权利的规定。事实上，在中美会谈开始的时候，中国方面向美方提交的全部在华美国人的名单中，就把一般美侨和犯法的美国人明白地加以区分。在中国犯法的美国人必须按照中国的法律程序处理，不可能有任何释放犯法美国人的期限；而且他们在服刑期间没有权利要求回国，只有当他们刑期已满或者中国采取了措施提前释放他们，才能进一步谈到他们行使回国权利的问题。至于中国根据自己的法律程序采取怎样的措施和在什么时候对那些人采取措施，那是中国的主权，不能容许别国干涉。这一切不仅是美方在会谈中所承认的，而且也正是协议所规定的。在中美会谈期间，中国方面已经采取措施释放了40名犯法美国人中的27名。按照这27名犯法美国人的罪行和被判的刑期来说，他们的回国是再快也没有了。但是美国方面不仅拒绝交出被监禁在美国的中国人的名单，而且至今没有对任何被监禁在美国的中国人采取措施，使他们能够尽速地行使回国的权利。
    问：最近报上登载了中国留美学生的家属控诉美国政府阻挠他们的亲人回国的信件。既然中美会谈对双方平民回国问题达成了协议，为什么在美国的中国人却还不能回国？
    答：美国政府的这些行为正足以证明违反中美双方关于平民回国问题的协议的是美国自己。美国政府曾经长期用威胁和迫害的手段，阻止无辜的中国人回国；这是美国政府公开承认了的。现在，协议达成以后，美国方面不仅没有采取适当措施使在美国的中国人能够尽速回国，不仅拒绝向我方提供在美国的中国人的全部名单和情况，而且拒绝协助印度驻美大使馆主动地调查在美国的中国人离境受到阻挠的事实。最近，美国政府还对在美国的中国人采取了进一步威胁的措施，规定中国留学生如果要暂时居留美国就必须取得台湾入境证。这是公然违反协议、企图剥夺在美国的中国人返回祖国的权利的行为。我们已经向美方提出严重抗议，坚决要求美方提供在美国的中国人的全部名单和情况，充分履行双方的协议，并且撤销违反协议的规定。
    问：中美会谈的发展前途如何？
    答：中国是为了解决中美两国之间的争端和和缓中美两国之间的紧张关系而参加中美会谈的。在五个多月的会谈过程中，双方对于第二项议程已经进行了将近四个月的讨论，至今还没有达成任何协议。而且，会议休会的时间愈来愈长。很显然，如果不是一方有意拖延，这种情况是不可能产生的。
    为了在第二项议程上寻求协议，中国方面已经作了一再的努力。但是，任何协议都必须有双方的努力才能达成，如果一方不断为寻求协议而努力，而另一方的行动却完全朝着相反的方向，会谈是不可能取得任何成就的。中美会谈目前所讨论的问题密切地关系着远东局势的和缓，中国方面将继续为寻求协议而努力，但是中国人民将不能同意中美会谈长此拖延下去。
