"Knowledge is Power" to have a Chinese version
    The Chinese version of the magazine "Knowledge is Power," sponsored by the Labor Reserve Main Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, will be published in Beijing.
    "Knowledge is Power" began publication 30 years ago. It popularizes scientific and technological achievements to its readers. Soviet scientists, engineers, designers, writers, journalists, artists, and others participate in the work of this magazine.
    In order to help young Chinese workers study, the editorial department of "Knowledge is Power" has decided to publish a Chinese version. The editing work for each issue of the Chinese version is basically prepared in Moscow first, and then translated and published in China; at the same time, a certain number of Chinese manuscripts will also be published. The work in China is the responsibility of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization. It is estimated that people with a junior high school education or above can understand this magazine.
    The first issue of the Chinese version of "Knowledge is Power" will be published in March of this year. The manuscripts and proofs have already been sent from Moscow to Beijing.

    “知识就是力量”将出中国版
    苏联部长会议劳动后备总局主办的杂志“知识就是力量”的中国版将在北京出版。
    “知识就是力量”在30年前就开始出版了。它通俗地给读者讲述科学技术的成就。这个杂志有苏联的科学家、工程师、设计师、作家、报刊记者、艺术家等参加工作。
    “知识就是力量”编辑部为了帮助中国青年工人学习，决定出版中国版。中国版的每期的编辑工作基本上先在莫斯科准备就绪，然后在中国翻译出版；同时还刊载一定数量的中国稿件。在中国的工作由中华全国科学技术普及协会负责。估计有初中以上文化水平的人都可以读懂这个杂志。
    “知识就是力量”中国版第一期将在今年3月间出版，稿件和版样已经由莫斯科寄到北京。
