The General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Taohuaquan Township, Yishui County, Shandong Province, paid attention to changing its leadership methods during the high tide of collectivization and the upsurge in production. As a result, it overcame the phenomenon of being rushed off its feet and ensured the correct leadership of the Party over the mass movement.

In the autumn of 1955, after studying Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," Sun Decheng, the secretary of the township general branch, thought: This year, not many cooperatives have been established, and we already feel overwhelmed, and it is difficult to lead. What if the high tide of collectivization arrives? Therefore, he first discussed this issue with the four and a half township cadres who were partially detached from production and summarized and reviewed the work of the first half of the year. Everyone agreed that to lead the great development of the collectivization movement, it is necessary to overcome the past work style of taking on everything, to give full play to the initiative of the general branch committee and all Party members, and to give full play to the role of various organizations and departments. Subsequently, a meeting of the township general branch committee was held, and criticism and self-criticism were carried out while summarizing the work of the general branch in the past six months. The cadres who were partially detached from production examined and criticized their own thinking and work style of taking on everything, and other members of the general branch also separately examined and criticized their own liberalistic problem of relying on the cadres who were partially detached from production for everything. The meeting finally determined the division of labor of the general branch committee members and decided that in the future, in addition to strengthening the leadership of the general branch committee, it is necessary to give full play to the role of various organizations and departments.

As a result, the work of the whole township has been significantly improved. After the heavy snow in December of that year, seeing that field production in the whole township was about to stop, the township general branch, in addition to carrying out ideological mobilization within the Party and the Communist Youth League for adhering to winter field production, immediately assisted the Communist Youth League organization in convening meetings of youth shock brigades in villages to mobilize the five youth shock brigades in the township to take the lead in adhering to winter field production after the heavy snow. In this way, the masses of the whole village continued to carry out production activities such as deep plowing and reservoir construction in the ice and snow. The township general branch also paid special attention to helping the women's committee mobilize women in the whole township to carry out winter production. As a result, 85% of the women in the township participated in production, carrying water to irrigate more than 700 mu of wheat, deep plowing more than 80 mu of land, and helping the women's committee learn to regularly summarize, inspect, and arrange work. The township general branch also paid attention to giving full play to the work initiative of various departments of the township people's committee. For example, after the township general branch committee studied and determined the method for the township's tax collection work, it handed it over to the director of the township finance and grain department for handling. The township general branch no longer took on everything as it did in the past, but rather supervised and inspected. As a result, the tax collection task was quickly completed.

Because the township general branch trusted various organizations and departments, it greatly improved the sense of responsibility and initiative of these organizations, greatly reduced the phenomenon of the township general branch being busy with many administrative affairs all day long, and was able to concentrate more time and energy on studying and guiding the collectivization movement. Each member of the township general branch was assigned to focus on one cooperative, specifically guiding and helping the work of one cooperative, and at the same time using the experience of specifically leading one cooperative to enrich the experience of the general branch committee in leading the collectivization movement and guide the entire collectivization movement. When winter production had just begun, the land in the whole township had to be winter plowed. At this time, due to the drought and hard soil, it was generally felt that winter plowing was impossible. Sun Decheng, the secretary of the township general branch, helped the Qianjin First Cooperative gain the experience of harrowing before plowing and promoted it throughout the township, enabling the township's winter plowing task to be completed on time. In the process of building cooperatives, the work of assessing the means of production encountered difficulties, and each village was unable to solve them. The township general branch immediately summarized the experience of Jingshantou Village in assessing the means of production, and then convened a meeting of cooperative affairs committee members in the township to introduce it, quickly solving the difficulties in assessing the means of production.

In leading the collectivization movement, the township general branch learned to grasp major issues related to principles and policies, educate cadres and masses with typical examples, and ensure the implementation of the Party's various policies. In December, when the general branch discovered that some cooperatives had mixed in landlord and rich peasant elements, and some poor peasants actively demanded to join the cooperative but were rejected, it immediately inspected and studied these two serious problems. Originally, the reason why landlord and rich peasant elements were able to mix into the cooperative was not only due to everyone's carelessness, but also the conscious shielding of members of the general branch committee. The reason why poor peasants were rejected from joining the cooperative was not only because everyone's class viewpoint was not clear, but also because members of the general branch committee took the lead in rejecting them. The township general branch seized this key issue and successively convened a meeting of the township general branch committee and a general meeting of Party members in the township. At the meeting, the 23 Party member cadres who worked actively and resolutely implemented the Party's class line were first commended, and then Liu Xide and Liu Yangrong, members of the township general branch committee, were exposed and criticized for their serious mistakes of losing their class stand by shielding landlords and rich peasants and rejecting poor peasants. At the meeting, five other Party member cadres were inspired and educated and deeply reviewed their mistakes of having a vague understanding of the Party's class line and turning a blind eye to the phenomenon of rejecting poor peasants. As a result, landlords and rich peasants who engaged in sabotage were expelled from the cooperative, and more than 20 poor peasant households who were rejected from joining the cooperative were all admitted into the cooperative. This struggle was a profound and vivid education on the Party's class line for Party members and the masses, and it played a great role in ensuring the implementation of the Party's class line.

Although the work tasks in the past few months have been very heavy, because the township general branch has improved its leadership methods, various tasks have been completed relatively well. Now 95% of the farmers in the township have joined the cooperative, and the quality of each cooperative is guaranteed. Despite the very unfavorable natural conditions in the winter of 1955, the township still plowed all 2,280 mu of land suitable for winter plowing, and deep plowed 510 mu of land, planted more than 30,000 trees, and built more than 500 earth embankments. Now, the masses of the whole township are busy building four reservoirs.

    克服了包办代替作风
    刘立范
    中共山东省沂水县桃花?乡总支在合作化高潮和生产高潮中，注意了改变领导方法，结果，克服了手忙脚乱的现象，保证了党对群众运动的正确领导。
    1955年秋天，乡总支书记孙德成学习了毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告以后，他想：今年合作社还办得不多，已经感到顾了东顾不了西，领导起来很吃力，要是合作化高潮到来了，怎么办呢？于是，他首先就同四个半脱离生产的乡干部研究这个问题，总结和检查了上半年的工作。大家一致认为，要领导合作化运动的大发展，就必须克服过去的包办代替作风，就必须发挥总支委员会和全体党员的积极性，必须发挥各个组织和部门的作用。接着，召开了乡总支委员会议，在总结总支半年来工作的时候，展开了批评和自我批评，半脱离生产的干部检查和批判了自己包办代替的思想作风，其他总支委员也分别检查和批判了自己一切都依赖半脱离生产干部的自由主义毛病。会议最后确定了总支委员的分工，并决定今后除加强总支委员会的领导外，必须充分发挥各个组织和各个部门的作用。
    这样作的结果，全乡的工作有了显著的改进。这年12月大雪以后，眼看全乡田间生产就要停顿，乡总支除在党内和团内作了坚持冬季田间生产的思想动员外，马上协助团组织，以村为单位召开了青年突击队的会议，动员全乡五个青年突击队在大雪之后带头坚持冬季田间生产。这样，全村群众在冰天雪地中继续进行了深翻地和修水库的生产活动。乡总支还特别注意帮助妇女委员发动全乡妇女进行冬季生产。结果全乡有85％的妇女参加了生产，担水浇麦700多亩，深翻地80多亩，并且帮助妇女委员学会了定期总结、检查和布置工作。乡总支也注意了发挥乡人民委员会各个部门的工作积极性。比如全乡的税收工作，乡总支委员会作了研究并确定办法之后，就交给乡财粮主任办理，乡总支不再像过去那样去包办代替，而是督促检查。结果税收任务很快全部完成了。
    由于乡总支相信各个组织和各个部门，因此大大提高了这些组织的责任心和积极性，大大减少了乡总支整天忙于很多行政事务的现象，就能够集中更多的时间和精力研究和指导合作化运动。乡总支的每个委员都分工重点掌握一个社，具体指导和帮助一个社的工作，同时用具体领导一个社的经验去丰富总支委员会领导合作化运动的经验，指导整个合作化运动。冬季生产刚刚开始，全乡土地要进行冬耕。这时由于天旱地硬，普遍感到无法进行冬耕。乡总支书记孙德成就帮助前进第一社取得了先耙后耕的经验，在全乡推广，使全乡的冬耕任务得以按时完成。在建社过程中，评定生产资料工作遇到了困难，各村都无法解决，乡总支马上总结了荆山头村评定生产资料的经验，然后召开了全乡的社务委员会议作了介绍，很快解决了评定生产资料中的困难。
    在领导合作化运动中，乡总支学会了抓住有关原则和有关政策的重大问题，用典型事例教育干部和群众，保证党的各项政策的贯彻执行。12月间，当总支发现了部分合作社混入了地主富农分子，以及有的贫农积极要求入社而受到排斥的时候，马上对这两个严重问题作了检查和研究。原来，地主富农分子所以能够混入合作社，不仅仅是由于大家的麻痹大意，还有总支委员有意识的包庇，贫农所以被拒绝入社，也不仅仅是大家阶级观点不明确，也有总支委员带头排斥。乡总支就抓住这一关键性的问题，先后召开了乡总支委员会和全乡党员大会。会上首先表扬了积极工作、坚决贯彻执行党的阶级路线的23名党员干部，然后又揭发和批判了乡总支委员刘希德和刘央荣包庇地主富农和排斥贫农的丧失阶级立场的严重错误。会上，还有五个党员干部受到了启发和教育，深刻地检讨了自己对党的阶级路线认识模糊，对排斥贫农的现象熟视无睹的错误。结果，有破坏行为的地主富农被开除出社，被排斥在社外的20多户贫农全部吸收入社。这次斗争，对党员，对群众都是一次关于党的阶级路线的深刻生动的教育，对保证贯彻党的阶级路线发生了很大的作用。
    虽然最近几个月的工作任务很繁重，但由于乡总支改进了领导方法，因此各项任务都完成得比较好。现在全乡已经有95％的农户入社，而且保证了各个社的质量。尽管1955年冬季自然条件十分不利，全乡还是把适宜冬耕的2，280亩土地全部耕过，并且深翻地510亩，植树3万多棵，修地堰500多道。现在，全乡群众正在紧张修筑四个水库。
