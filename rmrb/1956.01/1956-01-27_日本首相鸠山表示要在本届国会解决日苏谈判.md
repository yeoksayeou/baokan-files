Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 26th: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama stated at his first press conference of the year on January 26th that he "intends to resolve" the negotiations for the normalization of relations between Japan and the Soviet Union during the current Diet session.

Hatoyama also said that preventing war is now a "universal opinion" in the world, and that "the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union remains in a state of war, which, so to speak, is like being in a state where war can easily occur." He said, "Based on the reasons mentioned above, the Soviet Union will certainly be willing to normalize diplomatic relations. In this way, the Japan-Soviet negotiations will naturally progress."

    日本首相鸠山表示要在本届国会解决日苏谈判
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本首相鸠山一郎1月26日在今年第一次举行的记者招待会上说：他“打算在本届国会解决”日本同苏联之间的关系正常化的谈判。
    鸠山还说，防止战争目前已经是世界上“普遍的意见”，而“日苏之间的关系还原封未动地保持着战争状态，说起来，就好像处在容易发生战争的那种状态下面似的。”他说：“根据上面所说的原因，苏联当然也是会愿意使邦交正常化的。这样，日苏谈判自然会进展。”
