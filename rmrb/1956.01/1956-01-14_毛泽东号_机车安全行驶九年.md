    "Mao Zedong" Locomotive Safely Operated for Nine Years
    The "Mao Zedong" locomotive of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Administration had maintained safe operation for nine years and nine days by the 9th, creating a national record of over 787,900 kilometers of safe travel for freight locomotives.
    Since the "Mao Zedong" locomotive was named in Harbin, it has not had any accidents attributable to it since January 1, 1947. Now, the locomotive's operating crew is striving to create an even higher record of ten years and 900,000 kilometers of safe travel. (Xinhua News Agency)
