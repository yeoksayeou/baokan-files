　　The Living Conditions of the Japanese People are Becoming Increasingly Difficult
　　Pei Da
　　Japan has a well-developed industry, fertile rice paddies, and abundant marine resources. However, the Japanese people, known for their diligence, are finding their lives increasingly difficult.

　　In Japan's cities and villages, the number of unemployed and underemployed has reached 13 million. Even those with jobs find it hard to support their families. According to a survey conducted by the Japanese government's statistics bureau in 1954 on 14 million employed laborers, the income of Japanese working people has significantly decreased compared to before the war, with average wages actually only being one-third of pre-war levels. Even these meager wages are often delayed by employers on various pretexts. In 1953, employers delayed paying workers' wages an average of over three thousand times per month, amounting to 463 million yen; by June 1955, the number of incidents of employers delaying wages had increased to over 5,200 times, with the amount increasing to 1.76 billion yen. As a result, many working-class families can only afford thin rice porridge as their staple food, and some even resort to eating wild herbs to stave off hunger.

　　In rural Japan, the majority of farmers find that their harvests after paying rent are insufficient to sustain their lives and must rely on temporary work to supplement their income. However, with rising unemployment, their opportunities for making a living are dwindling. Due to low rice prices and high prices for industrial products (fertilizers, agricultural tools, pesticides, etc.), even farmers who have grain to sell face difficult lives. For example, this year the officially set basic price for Japanese rice is 10,030 yen per koku (approximately 180 liters), but after deducting packaging and other expenses, the actual selling price is only 9,701 yen, which is insufficient to cover the cost of production.

　　In recent years, the Japanese yen has continued to depreciate, prices have risen sharply, and taxes are extremely heavy, causing great suffering to the Japanese people. According to statistics at the end of 1954, the amount of currency issued in Japan reached 622 billion yen, an increase of 248 times compared to the same period in 1937. Currently, prices in Japan are 350 times higher than before the war. As a result, the income of the Japanese people has relatively decreased significantly. Before the war, national tax revenue accounted for 12.9% of the national income, while in 1955 it reached 19.9%. In particular, the tax exemption threshold has been greatly reduced after the war, and the number of taxpayers has increased tenfold compared to before the war, forcing people with meager incomes to pay taxes as well. Japanese farmers are even more subject to heavy tax exploitation. Taking income tax, the most important of the taxes, as an example, it was less than one-tenth of farmers' income before the war, but after the war, it has averaged over 20%.

　　Under these circumstances, the phenomenon of suicide due to unbearable living pressure has increased unprecedentedly in Japan. According to official Japanese investigations, 20,423 people committed suicide in 1954 alone, an average of one person committing suicide every 25 minutes. This is unprecedented in the more than 50 years since Japan began keeping population survey records. Some parents, unable to bear seeing their children suffer, kill their own offspring. Many people are forced to sell their blood, sell their children, or sell their wives. In Osaka, a strong man in his forties, unable to make a living, even sold himself for 40,000 yen.

　　Japanese women are living an even more humiliating life. Daughters from many poor families are sold to factories or landlords' homes as slaves, and large numbers of women are forced into prostitution. According to a spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Labor, there were more than 500,000 prostitutes in Japan in June 1954. Difficult living conditions are causing this number to increase constantly. The American magazine "U.S. News & World Report" shamelessly stated, "Japanese girls can be bought for less than the price of purebred cats and dogs." Due to poverty, the phenomenon of Japanese school-age children being unable to attend school is even more prevalent.

　　The hardship of the Japanese people's lives is caused by the long-term occupation of Japan by the American army. The U.S. military has established military bases in Japan without limit, occupying large areas of farmland and sea, leaving many Japanese farmers and fishermen without a means of livelihood. The United States has placed the huge cost of military occupation on the shoulders of the Japanese people, increasing the tax burden on the Japanese people. In the ten years after the war, Japan has paid more than 5.6 billion U.S. dollars simply to support the American army, which is equivalent to more than two years of the Japanese government's budget. American monopoly capital invests in Japanese enterprises, plundering large amounts of profits from Japan. The United States also restricts Japan's free trade and dumps goods at high prices. From 1951 to July 1955, Japan's trade deficit with the United States reached 2,371 million U.S. dollars. This has severely hindered the development of Japanese industrial and agricultural production, increasing the difficulty of employment for the Japanese people. At the same time, the American authorities are forcing Japan to expand its military and prepare for war, causing Japan's military spending to increase year by year. Japan's pure military budget for 1955 reached 235.9 billion yen, more than double the actual expenditure in 1952. All of this has brought serious consequences to the Japanese economy, increased the burden on the Japanese people, and worsened their living conditions.

　　The Japanese people recognize the fundamental cause of their difficult lives. Therefore, their struggle against the continued occupation of Japan by the U.S. military, against the expansion of military bases by the U.S. military, against military expansion and war preparations, and for peace, is rising year by year.

　　In 1955, the Japanese people living near U.S. military bases such as Mount Fuji, Tachikawa, Komaki, Yokota, Kisarazu, and Niigata continuously launched various forms of struggle such as petitions, demonstrations, sit-ins, and hunger strikes. For example, the people living in Sunagawa-cho in Tokyo have been heroically opposing the expansion of Tachikawa base by the United States, resolutely stopping the forced requisition of their land by the U.S. and Japanese authorities. They have built watchtowers and erected barbed wire fences on the roads leading to Tachikawa base. Every time a surveying team arrives in Sunagawa-cho, they ring the alarm bell and gather men, women, and children together. At each entrance, thousands of residents and workers who support them form a blockade line arm in arm, preventing the surveying team from carrying out surveying work to build a military base. They shout: "Defend national freedom!" "Yankees, go home!"

　　In order to break free from American rule, fight for national independence and the right to live, and get rid of increasingly impoverished living conditions, the Japanese people have risen up in struggle with boiling blood, and they are uniting more closely to fight. This just struggle of the Japanese people cannot be stopped by any force.

### 日本人民生活越来越困苦

　　日本人民生活越来越困苦
    裴达
    日本有很发达的工业，肥沃的稻田，丰富的海产。可是，以勤劳著称的日本人民，他们的生活却越来越苦了。
    在日本的城市和乡村里，失业和半失业的人数已经达到1，300万。有职业的人，也很难维持一家人的生活。据日本政府统计局1954年对1，400万雇佣劳动者的调查，日本劳动人民的收入比战前有很显著的降低，平均工资实际上只等于战前的三分之一。就是这样微薄的工资，资方还经常借故拖延不发。在1953年，资方每月拖欠工人工资的事件平均有三千余次，金额是46，300万日元；到了1955年6月，资方拖欠工资的事件增加到5，200余次，金额增加到176，000万日元。这样，许多工人家庭只能用稀粥为主食，甚至有以野草充饥的。
    在日本农村中，大多数农民耕种土地的收获，在缴纳地租后，不足以维持生活，还要靠做临时工来补助。但在失业现象日益严重的情况下，他们谋生的机会越来越少了。由于米价低廉，工业产品（肥料、农具、农药等）昂贵，就是有粮食出卖的农民生活也很困难。如今年日本大米每日石官定基本价格是10，030元，除去包装等费用，实际售价只有9，701元，还不足以补偿生产的成本。
    这几年来，日元不断贬值，物价日益高昂，而且捐税奇重，给日本人民生活带来极大的痛苦。截至1954年底的统计，日本通货发行额达6，220亿日元，比1937年同期增加了248倍。现在日本的物价高达战前的350倍。这样，日本人民的收入就相对地大大下降了。战前国家税收占国民收入的12.9％，而1955年则达到19.9％。特别是在战后免税标准大大降低，纳税人数比战前增加了十倍，迫使收入低微的人也要缴纳税款。日本农民更受到重税的盘剥。拿捐税中最主要的所得税来说，战前不到农民收入的十分之一，而战后平均已超过20％。
    在这种情况下，因不堪生活的压迫而自杀的现象，在日本已空前增多。据日本官方的调查，在1954年自杀的就有20，423个人，平均每25分钟就有一人自杀。这是在日本开始有人口调查记录以来的50多年间所没有过的。有的父母实在不忍心看着孩子活受折磨，就杀死了亲生的子女。许多人被迫出卖自己的血液，卖掉自己的儿女或妻子。在大阪，有个40多岁的壮年男子无法生活，甚至把自己卖了四万日元。
    日本妇女更是过着屈辱的生活。许多贫苦家庭的女儿被卖给工厂或地主的家里当奴隶，大批的妇女被迫去卖淫。据日本劳动省发言人估计，在1954年6月，日本全国的妓女有50多万人。困苦的生活使得这个数目在不断增加。美国杂志“美国新闻与世界报道”曾厚颜无耻地说：“日本姑娘，可以用比纯种的猫、狗更便宜的价钱买到。”由于生活的穷困，日本学龄儿童不能入学的现象，那就更普遍了。
    日本人民生活的困苦，是美国军队长期占领日本造成的。美军在日本无限制地建立军事基地，侵占大量农田和海面，使日本许多农民和渔民生活失去依靠。美国把庞大的军事占领费用压在日本人民的头上，增加了日本人民的捐税负担。在战后十年中，日本单供养美国军队就付出了56亿以上的美元，这等于日本政府两年多的预算。美国垄断资本在日本企业中投资，从日本掠夺了大量利润。美国还限制日本自由贸易，高价倾销商品。从1951年到1955年7月，日本对美国的贸易逆差达237，100万美元。这使得日本工农业生产的发展，受到严重的阻碍，增加了日本人民就业的困难。同时，美国当局强迫日本进行扩军备战，使日本军事费用年年增加。1955年度日本纯军事预算达2，359亿日元，比1952年的实际支出增加了一倍多。这一切都给日本经济带来了严重的后果，增加了日本人民负担，使他们的生活状况恶化。
    日本人民认识到使他们生活困苦的这个根本原因。因此，他们坚决反对美军继续占领日本，反对美军扩大军事基地，反对扩军备战和要求和平的斗争，一年比一年地高涨。
    以1955年来说，住在富士山、立川、小牧、横田、木更津和新潟等美国军事基地附近的日本人民，曾不断展开请愿、示威、静坐、绝食等各种形式的斗争。如住在东京市砂川町的人民，一直在英勇反对美国扩大立川基地，坚决制止美日当局强征他们的土地。他们在通往立川基地的路上，建立了哨楼，拉上了铁丝网。每次在测量队到达砂川町之前，他们就敲起警钟，把男女老少集合起来。在各个入口处，成千的居民和支援他们的工人一起，臂挽臂地组成了封锁线，阻挡测量队进行建立军事基地的测量工作。他们高呼：“保卫民族自由！”“美国佬，滚回去！”
    为摆脱美国的统治，争取民族独立和生活权利，摆脱日益贫困的生活状态，日本人民已经热血沸腾地起来斗争了，他们更加紧密地团结起来斗争了。日本人民的这种正义斗争，是任何势力所阻挡不住的。
