Another Great Victory in the Socialist Transformation
By our reporter

Yesterday afternoon, the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace hosted another grand celebration. This was a get-together for over 50,000 handicraft workers and their families in Beijing to celebrate collectivization. Thousands of students and artists also joined the handicraft workers in performing various cultural programs.

Beijing has been undergoing rapid changes in recent days: On January 10th, all capitalist industry and commerce in the city announced complete joint state-private ownership; on January 11th, agricultural cooperatives in the five suburban districts were all converted into advanced cooperatives; and on January 12th, the entire handicraft industry in the city was also fully collectivized. Beijing's socialist transformation has achieved glorious victories simultaneously on all fronts.

The cooperative movement of Beijing's handicraft industry has been underway for several years. By the end of 1955, over 36,000 handicraft workers in the city had organized 414 cooperatives. After organizing, production greatly developed, and the lives of the members also improved. Members of the Second Sewing Production Cooperative nearly doubled their average monthly output after organizing. Before joining the Qianjin Cotton Weaving Production Cooperative in 1951, members had an average monthly income of 16 yuan; by 1955, the average monthly income reached 42 yuan. These facts have firmly attracted the vast number of handicraft workers. In October last year, a cotton weaving production cooperative with more than 700 people appeared in Beijing. This cooperative was formed by the merger of nine small cooperatives. After the merger, they built a large factory building of more than 3,000 square meters and used all mechanical production. In the past, each person could only produce one bolt of cloth per month, but now it has increased to 28 bolts. The income of the members has more than doubled compared to the past. They have also held many cultural and welfare programs. Members can enjoy free medical care when they are sick, and there are cultural teachers to help members learn culture in their spare time. Attracted by the superiority of the handicraft cooperatives and influenced by the upsurge of the socialist transformation of agriculture and capitalist industry and commerce, the vast number of handicraft workers could no longer wait and asked to join the cooperatives one after another. Some people repeatedly applied to join the cooperative, and when they were not approved, they went to the Handicraft Workers Association to negotiate with the staff.

Under this new situation, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee, based on the demands of the vast number of handicraft workers, revised the original plan and changed the past working methods. The city organized more than 20 specialized joint cooperatives by industry, and the specialized joint cooperatives led each industry to implement collectivization to accelerate the speed of collectivization and meet the needs of the masses. As a result, the vast number of handicraft workers became more active. Qu Fugang, who made children's clothing in Chongwen District, and three other colleagues discussed the issue of organizing a cooperative. As a result, more than 50 people came to apply for participation after hearing the news. Liu Kai, the owner of a weaving workshop at No. 2 Nanqiao Bay, immediately put down his machine when he heard the news that he could sign up to join the cooperative and said, "Great, I've been waiting for this!" He immediately went to the registration station to sign up. The bicycle industry in Dongsi District held a meeting on the evening of the 8th to discuss the establishment of a cooperative. The next day, more than 300 households hung red banners with the words "Welcoming Collectivization" on their doors. Yihe and Dejuxiang and other black and white iron handicraft households inside Andingmen automatically connected 24 households in a few days after hearing the news of organizing a cooperative, and found four factories and four storefronts. When they participated in the parade on the 12th, they told people: After the various tasks are arranged in a few days, we will start producing sprayers, new-style plows and other agricultural tools to support farmers in developing production.

In this collectivization movement, the new and old members fully displayed the spirit of unity and friendship. The 29 old cooperatives in Xidan District absorbed more than 1,000 new members and paid special attention to absorbing elderly and weak handicraft workers. When the celebration meeting was held at the Dahua Cinema on the 11th, the 8th Shoemaking Cooperative, the 30th Sewing Cooperative, and others sent more than 600 members to congratulate the new members with gongs and drums. The 28 cotton weaving factories in Chongwen District who decided to join the 23rd Cotton Cloth Production Cooperative held a get-together with the old members on the morning of the 12th. The old members warmly welcomed the new partners and said that they would ensure that both the expansion of the cooperative and production would not be neglected. The new members also expressed that they would humbly learn from the old members, unite and help each other, and do a good job in production. After the meeting, they intimately carried the red flag together to participate in the parade.

Many handicrafts in Beijing are famous far and wide, especially the special handicrafts, which enjoy international reputation. Many international friends praised Beijing handicrafts for their superb skills and excellent traditions. Now that the collectivization of the handicraft industry in Beijing has been fully realized, the handicrafts will surely make great strides forward on the existing foundation.

    社会主义改造事业中的又一大胜利
    本报记者
    12日下午，北京市劳动人民文化宫里，又举行了一次盛大的庆祝会，这是北京市五万多名手工业者和他们的家属庆祝合作化的联欢大会，数千名学生和文艺工作者，也和手工业者们一起表演了各种文娱节目。
    最近几天，北京处在突飞猛进的变化中：10日，全市资本主义工商业宣布全部公私合营；11日，近郊五个区的农业合作社又全部转成高级社；12日，全市手工业又全面合作化了。北京市的社会主义改造事业在各条战线上同时获得了辉煌的胜利。
    北京市手工业的合作化运动已经有了好几年的历史，到1955年底，全市已有36，000多个手工业劳动者组织了414个合作社。他们组织起来以后，生产有很大的发展，社员生活也随着提高。第二缝纫生产合作社的社员，组织起来以后，每人每月平均产量提高将近一倍。前进棉织生产合作社的社员，在1951年入社前，每人每月平均收入16元；到1955年每人每月平均收入达到42元。这些事实都牢牢地吸引了广大的手工业者。去年10月间，北京市出现了一个七百多人的棉织生产合作社，这个社是由九个小社合并起来的。他们并社以后，盖了三千多平方公尺的大厂房，全部使用机械生产，过去每人每月只能生产一匹布，现在提高到28匹。社员的收入比过去提高两倍多。他们还举办了许多文化福利事业，社员生病可以享受免费的医疗，业余时间还有文化教员帮助社员学习文化。在手工业合作社优越性的吸引下，在农业和资本主义工商业社会主义改造高潮的影响下，广大手工业者再也等不及了，他们纷纷要求参加合作社。有的人一再申请入社，没得到批准，就跑到手工业劳动者协会去找工作人员交涉。
    在这种新的形势下，北京市委和市人民委员会根据广大手工业者的要求，修改了原来的计划，改变了过去的工作方法。全市按行业组织了20多个专业联社，由专业联社领导各行业实行合作化，以加快合作化的速度，满足群众的要求。这样一来，广大的手工业者更加活跃起来了。崇文区做童装的屈福广和三户同行的在一起商量组织合作社的问题，结果有50多人听到消息都跑来要求参加。南桥湾二号织布业主刘凯，听到可以报名入社的消息时，连忙放下机子说：“好啦，这回可盼到啦！”马上到登记站去报了名。东四区自行车行业，在8日晚间开了一个酝酿建社的会议，第二天就有三百多家大门上挂起了“迎接合作化”的红幛子。安定门内的益和、德聚祥等黑白铁手工业户，听到组织合作社的消息以后，几天中就自动串连了24户，并找好四个厂房四个门市部，12日参加游行大会时告诉人说：过两天，各项工作安排后，我们就开始生产喷雾器、新式犁锄等农具，支援农民兄弟发展生产。
    在这次合作化运动中，新老社员之间充分发挥了团结友爱精神。西单区29个老社共吸收新社员一千多户，并且特别注意吸收年老和体弱的手工业者。11日在大华电影院举行庆祝合作化大会的时候，第八制鞋合作社和第30缝纫合作社等派去六百多名社员，敲锣打鼓地向新社员祝贺。崇文区决定参加第23棉布生产合作社的28家棉织厂的手工业者，12日上午和老社员们举行了联欢会，老社员热烈欢迎新伙伴，表示要做到扩社生产两不误，新社员也表示要虚心向老社员学习，团结互助，搞好生产。会后便亲密地抬着红旗一起去参加了游行。
    北京市很多手工业品是远近驰名的，尤其是特种工艺品更享有国际盛誉，很多国际友人称赞北京工艺品有高超的技术和优良的传统。现在北京市手工业合作化已经全部实现，手工业品也必将在现有的基础上大步前进。
