A small hydroelectric power station is being built in Modekou Village, western suburbs of Beijing. After the completion of this hydroelectric power station, it will generate more than 40 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year.

This hydroelectric power station uses the drop in the Yongding River diversion channel to generate electricity. The entire project costs much less than building a thermal power station of the same capacity, and all investment can be recovered within two years after completion and power generation. The cost of each kilowatt-hour is only about one-third of that of thermal power generation.

    北京市西郊模式口村兴建一座小型水力发电站
    北京市西郊模式口村正在兴建一座小型水力发电站。这座水电站建成以后，每年能发出4，000多万度电。
    这座水电站是利用永定河引水河道上的落差来发电的，整个工程造价比建造同容量的火力发电站便宜得多，建成发电后，两年内就可以把全部投资收回。每度电的成本，只等于火力发电的三分之一左右。
