Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions held its Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Executive Committee from the 6th to the 13th. The meeting reviewed the leadership work of the trade union and formulated a preliminary plan for future trade union work.

In his report to the meeting, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of the trade union leadership, which lagged behind reality. He pointed out that trade union organizations at all levels must change their work style and improve leadership to adapt to the current new situation. Lai Ruoyu pointed out that under the current circumstances, it is of great significance to strengthen the work of industrial trade unions. It can unite workers in the same sector of the national economy nationwide and can strengthen their sense of responsibility for completing national plans, especially to facilitate the promotion of advanced experiences, continuously improve the technical level of workers, and increase labor productivity. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the existing industrial trade unions, so that they can implement systematic leadership according to industry, and in the next one or two years, gradually restore some industrial trade unions that were abolished in the past and establish some new industrial trade unions.

The meeting also discussed the issue of calling on workers across the country to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the issue of strengthening the work of industrial trade unions, strengthening the work of trade unions in the socialist transformation of private enterprises, and strengthening the work of trade unions to support agricultural cooperativization, and adopted corresponding resolutions.

Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions called on the broad masses of workers across the country to extensively launch socialist competition, use their new achievements in production to greet the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and strive to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

The meeting pointed out that the key to completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule lies in promoting advanced experience, learning from advanced Soviet technology, developing rationalization proposals, and gradually raising the vast number of workers and all enterprises to advanced levels. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is preparing to convene a national conference of advanced producers around the "May Day" International Labor Day this year to set off a wave of learning from advanced experience nationwide. Each industrial trade union should carefully collect the advanced experiences that have been effective in recent years, identify them, compile them into books, and widely distribute them. All enterprises should universally establish advanced experience schools, hold advanced experience exhibitions, organize observation performances, and disseminate advanced experience. Through the above methods, help backward enterprises, workshops, and work sections gradually improve to advanced levels.

The meeting believes that organizing national inter-factory competitions and same-trade competitions according to the industrial system is an effective method to improve the production level of enterprises. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Executive Committee tasked the national committees of each industrial trade union to work with the relevant industrial departments to formulate the conditions for inter-factory competitions and same-trade competitions, timely summarize and promote advanced experience, and vigorously lead this socialist competition movement.

The Executive Committee plenary session also studied the issues of further developing the rationalization proposal movement, promoting team-based economic accounting, and organizing workers to learn technology and run spare-time technical schools, believing that these are the basic measures to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and trade union organizations in various regions must earnestly implement them.

    中华全国总工会执行委员会全体会议通过决议
    号召全国职工开展竞赛争取提前完成五年计划
    新华社13日讯  中华全国总工会在6日到13日举行第七届执行委员会第四次全体会议。会议检查了工会的领导工作，制定了今后工会工作的初步规划。
    全国总工会主席赖若愚在会议上所作的报告中，批判了工会领导工作落后于实际的右倾保守思想，指出工会各级组织今后必须转变工作作风，改进领导，以适应目前新的形势。赖若愚指出，在目前情况下提出加强产业工会工作有重大意义，它能够使国民经济中同一部门的职工在全国范围内联合起来，并且可以加强他们对完成国家计划的责任感，特别是便于推广先进经验，不断地提高职工的技术水平，提高劳动生产率。因此，必须健全现在已有的产业工会，使它们能按产业实行系统的领导，并且要在今后一两年内逐步恢复过去撤销了的一些产业工会，建立一些新的产业工会。
    这次会议还讨论了号召全国职工提前完成第一个五年计划的问题，讨论了加强产业工会工作、加强私营企业社会主义改造中的工会工作以及加强工会工作支援农业合作化等若干问题，并且通过了相应的决议。
    新华社13日讯  中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会第四次全体会议号召全国广大职工，广泛地开展社会主义竞赛，用自己生产上的新成就，迎接中国共产党第八次全国代表大会，争取提前完成第一个五年计划。
    会议指出，提前完成五年计划的关键在于推广先进经验，学习苏联先进技术，开展合理化建议，把广大职工和所有的企业逐步提高到先进水平上来，全国总工会准备在今年“五一”国际劳动节前后，召开全国先进生产者代表会议，在全国范围内掀起学习先进经验的热潮。各产业工会应认真地搜集几年来已经行之有效的先进经验，经过鉴定，汇集成册，广泛发行。各企业应该普遍建立先进经验学校，举办先进经验展览会，组织观摩表演，传播先进经验。通过以上种种方式，帮助落后企业、车间、工段逐步地提高到先进水平。
    会议认为，按产业系统组织全国性的厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛，是提高企业生产水平的有效方法。执行委员会第四次全体会议责成各产业工会全国委员会会同有关的产业部门，制定厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛的条件，及时总结和推广先进经验，大力领导这一社会主义竞赛运动。
    执行委员会全体会议还研究了进一步开展合理化建议运动、推广班组经济核算及组织职工学习技术、办好业余技术学校等问题，认为这些都是提前完成五年计划的基本措施，各地工会组织必须认真贯彻执行。
