    Strange "Instructions"
    Recently, Mao Lihua, the Secretary of the Chengnan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, suddenly issued a strange "instruction" to the Hongxing Vegetable Production Cooperative in Dingjia Village, ordering them to reduce the vegetable planting area and switch to planting grain crops within a limited time.
    As soon as this "instruction" came out, it was like pouring a bucket of cold water over the heads of the cooperative members. Dingjia Village is a well-known Chinese cabbage production area in Jiaoxian County, producing thousands of tons of Chinese cabbage every year to supply the needs of the cities. This land is suitable for growing cabbage; planting corn only yields 120 jin per mu, while planting cabbage yields at least 15,000 jin. What reason does the District Committee have to switch these vegetable fields to grain crops? It turns out that this District Committee is responding to the call to increase grain production, and therefore does not hesitate to advocate switching vegetable fields to grain crops.
    The masses expressed dissatisfaction with this "instruction." This dissatisfaction is justified. The District Committee Secretary does not understand that increasing vegetable production is as important as increasing grain production. Cities need the countryside to supply both grain and vegetables; at the same time, from an economic point of view, switching vegetable fields to grain crops is also a losing proposition.

    奇怪的“指示”
    最近，中共山东胶县城南区区委书记毛利华突然对丁家庄宏星蔬菜生产合作社发出了一个奇怪的“指示”，要他们限期减少蔬菜种植面积，改种粮食作物。
    这个“指示”一下，社员们的头上就像泼上了一盆凉水。丁家庄是胶县有名的大白菜产地，每年能生产成千上万的大白菜供应城市的需要。这些地适宜于种白菜，种玉米每亩只能收120斤，种白菜却至少收15，000斤。区委会有什么理由要在这些菜地改种粮食呢？原来这个区委会是为了响应增产粮食的号召，因此不惜提倡菜地也改种粮食。
    群众对这个“指示”表示了不满。这种不满是正当的。这个区委书记不懂得增产蔬菜与增产粮食有同等的重要意义，城市既要农村供应粮食，也要农村供应蔬菜；同时从经济上说，菜地改种粮食也是得不偿失的事。
