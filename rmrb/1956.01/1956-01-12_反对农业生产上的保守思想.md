    Opposing Conservative Thought in Agricultural Production
    Zhong Huai

    Since mid-November 1955, Shandong Dazhong Daily, while publicizing the rectification of agricultural cooperatives, has strengthened its publicity regarding agricultural production. A basic spirit that runs through this publicity like a red thread is the opposition to right-leaning conservative thought in leading agricultural production.

    Shandong Province has decided to accelerate the pace of agricultural production increase on the basis of the high tide of agricultural cooperation, aiming to reach and surpass the agricultural production targets for 1957 in 1956. Taking grain production as an example, it is to increase by 13% compared to 1955. The proposal of this task is the result of criticizing conservative thinking in leading agricultural production; to achieve this task, it is still necessary to deeply struggle against conservative thinking in leadership organs at all levels and rural cadres. In the publicity campaign to strive for early and over-fulfilled agricultural production plans, Dazhong Daily has tightly grasped the important link of opposing conservative thought, which is very necessary.

    In order to oppose conservative thought, Dazhong Daily, in a series of commentaries on rural work, repeatedly revealed a fundamental characteristic of the current situation, which is that today's Shandong countryside has changed from being dominated by small-scale peasant economy to being dominated by cooperative economy. The reason why many people have conservative ideas on the issue of agricultural production is precisely because they do not see this major change in the rural economic base, or they underestimate the serious significance of this change. They believe that the growth rate of agricultural production in the past few years has only been a few percent, and it is impossible to break through this "law." Dazhong Daily sharply criticized this small-scale peasant economic viewpoint that lags behind reality. In the editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Conservative Thought and Strive to Over-fulfill the Five-Year Agricultural Production Plan in Four Years," the newspaper quoted vivid examples of large-scale production increases in agricultural cooperatives in various places, arguing eloquently that after the individual small-scale peasant economy is transformed into the collective cooperative economy, it will inevitably promote the rapid development of agricultural productive forces. In editorials such as "All Work Must Adapt to the New Situation in Rural Areas," the newspaper reminded people to pay attention to the fact that the production increase targets proposed by many agricultural cooperatives in their production plans are not a few percent, but more than ten or even dozens of percent. Anyone who does not see this new situation and leads agricultural production with conservative thinking will be seriously divorced from the masses.

    In order to oppose conservative thought, Dazhong Daily has used great effort to promote the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses. For more than a month, Dazhong Daily has reported extensively on the creations and innovations of agricultural cooperatives in various places in terms of production. For important achievements and experiences in agricultural production in various places, it has also published editorials, organized pictorials and special pages, and carried out publicity in a big way. In many reports and commentaries, the newspaper not only introduced and promoted advanced production experience, but also focused on praising the high socialist construction enthusiasm and endless wisdom and strength of the peasant masses. For example, when introducing how the Shiquanhu Agricultural Cooperative in Junan County relied on collective strength to create a happy life of abundant crops and herds of cattle and sheep in barren mountainous areas, the newspaper published an editorial "Turn Poor Mountains into Rich Mountains," using enthusiastic language to highly evaluate people's socialist enthusiasm for overcoming difficulties and building mountainous areas. When introducing the pig-raising and manure-accumulating experience of the Song Changsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Yanggu County, the newspaper specifically pointed out that the reason why this cooperative was able to achieve an average of five pigs per household in cotton-producing areas where the masses had no pig-raising habits and feed was relatively scarce was precisely because they had the bold innovative spirit to break with conventions. All these facts vividly illustrate a truth, that is, there are difficulties in increasing agricultural production, but as long as we believe in the masses and rely on the masses, we can overcome any difficulties.

    In order to oppose conservative thought, Dazhong Daily also vigorously advocated the style of leading organs going deep into reality and close to the masses. The newspaper once published such educational materials: When the Liaocheng Prefectural Committee was formulating the agricultural production plan for 1956, it initially only proposed to increase grain production by 8%, striving for a 12% increase. Later, several responsible staff members of the Prefectural Committee went to the countryside to understand the situation, and found that the production plans or actual production increase rates of the agricultural cooperatives were much larger than the Prefectural Committee's plan. They raised the production increase target to 40%. Later, the comrades of the Prefectural Committee went deep into the countryside again, analyzed production potential with the peasant masses in an all-round way, and specifically studied ways to increase production. They were further inspired and formulated a plan to increase grain production by 50%, which was both advanced and realistic. This proves that only by going deep into reality and close to the masses can we completely break conservative ideas, stand in front of the masses, and lead the masses forward.

    In agricultural production, as in agricultural cooperation, right-leaning conservative thinking is a stumbling block on our road forward. Without breaking conservative thinking, we cannot achieve the task of completing the agricultural production plan ahead of schedule and over-fulfilling it. Dazhong Daily has launched a relatively systematic and powerful struggle against conservative thought, which has made the necessary ideological preparations for the upcoming high tide of agricultural production. In addition to Dazhong Daily, recently Fujian Daily, Jiangxi Daily, Gansu Daily, and others have also criticized conservative thinking in agricultural production. The practices of these newspapers should be valued by newspapers in various places, especially newspapers in agricultural areas.

### 反对农业生产上的保守思想

    反对农业生产上的保守思想
    钟怀
    山东大众日报从1955年11月中旬起，在宣传整顿农业合作社的同时，加强了关于农业生产的宣传。在这个宣传中像一根红线似地贯串着一个基本精神，就是反对领导农业生产上的右倾保守思想。
    山东省决定在农业合作化高潮的基础上加快农业增产的速度，要在1956年达到和超过1957年的农业生产指标。拿粮食产量来说，就是要比1955年增长13％。这个任务的提出，是批判了领导农业生产上的保守思想的结果；要实现这个任务，还需要深入地同各级领导机关和农村干部中的保守思想作斗争。大众日报在争取提前超额完成农业生产计划的宣传中，紧紧地抓住了反对保守思想这个重要的环节，这是十分必要的。
    为了反对保守思想，大众日报在一系列有关农村工作的评论中，反复地揭示了当前形势的一个根本特点，就是今天的山东农村已经由小农经济占优势改变为以合作社经济占优势。许多人在农业生产的问题上所以有保守思想，正是因为他们看不清农村经济基础的这个重大变化，或者对这个变化的严重意义估计不足，他们认为几年来农业生产的增长速度都只是百分之几，要突破这个“规律”是办不到的。大众日报尖锐地批判了这种思想落后于实际的小农经济观点。在“克服右倾保守思想，争取四年超额完成五年农业生产计划”的社论中，报纸就引用了各地农业合作社大量增产的活生生的事例，雄辩地说明了当个体的小农经济转变为集体的合作社经济之后，必然会促进农业生产力的迅速发展。在“各项工作都要适应农村的新形势”等社论中，报纸又提醒人们注意这样一个事实，就是许多农业合作社在生产规划中提出的增产目标，不是百分之几，而是百分之十几甚至几十。谁要是看不到这个新情况，而以保守思想来领导农业生产，谁就会严重地脱离群众。
    为了反对保守思想，大众日报用很大的力量宣扬了群众的创造性和积极性。一个多月以来，大众日报对各地农业合作社在生产上的创造和革新作了大量的报道。对于各地农业生产上的重要成就和经验，还发表社论，组织画刊和专页，大张旗鼓地进行了宣传。在许多报道和评论中，报纸不但介绍和推广了先进生产经验，而且着重地表扬了农民群众高度的建设社会主义的热情和无穷无尽的智慧和力量。例如，在介绍莒南县石泉湖农业合作社依靠集体力量，在贫瘠的山地创造了庄稼丰收、牛羊成群的幸福生活的时候，报纸就发表了“变穷山为富山”的社论，以热情洋溢的语句，对人们战胜困难建设山区的社会主义积极性作了极高的评价。在介绍阳谷县宋长生农业合作社养猪积肥经验的时候，报纸又特别指出，这个社所以能在群众没有养猪习惯、饲料又比较缺乏的产棉地区达到了平均每户养猪五口的成就，正是因为他们具有打破成规的大胆革新精神。所有这些事实都生动地说明了一个道理，就是在提高农业生产方面是存在着困难的，但是只要我们相信群众和依靠群众，我们就能克服任何困难。
    为了反对保守思想，大众日报还大力提倡了领导机关深入实际、接近群众的作风。报纸曾经发表过这样富于教育意义的材料：聊城地委在制定1956年的农业生产计划时，起初只提出增产粮食8％，争取增产12％。后来地委几个负责工作人员下乡了解情况，发现不论是农业合作社的生产规划或实际增产速度都比地委的计划大得多，他们就把增产指标提高为40％。以后地委的同志们再次深入农村，同农民群众一起全面分析生产潜力，具体研究增产办法，他们进一步受到启发，就制定出增产粮食50％的既先进又现实的计划。这就证明，只有深入实际接近群众，才能彻底打破保守思想，才能站在群众的前面，带领群众前进。
    在农业生产方面，也如同在农业合作化方面一样，右倾保守思想是我们前进道路上的绊脚石。不打破保守思想，我们就不可能实现提前超额完成农业生产计划的任务。大众日报向保守思想展开了比较系统、比较有力的斗争，这就为即将到来的农业生产高潮进行了必要的思想准备。除大众日报外，最近福建日报、江西日报、甘肃日报等，也对农业生产上的保守思想作了批判。这些报纸的做法，应当受到各地报纸特别是农业地区的报纸的重视。
