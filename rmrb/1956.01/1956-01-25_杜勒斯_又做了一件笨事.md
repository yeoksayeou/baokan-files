Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 24th - The British "Manchester Guardian" published an editorial commenting on Dulles' statement at a press conference on January 17 regarding his remarks published in "Life" magazine.

The "Manchester Guardian" believes that Dulles' statement at the press conference was "another stupid thing to do." It pointed out that Dulles, in making the statement and answering questions, once again revised history to suit his own incomplete memory.

The newspaper criticized Dulles for once again issuing crude intimidation against the Chinese people in his statement. It said: The US government would do well to now renounce any obligation to defend the coastal islands, because most Asian countries sympathize with China; nevertheless, the newspaper avoids talking about the sacred right of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan.

The "Manchester Guardian" also said that it would have been "more appropriate" if Dulles had admitted that the statements in "Life" magazine were wrong. Dulles "could also have made amends and admitted that his resistance to discussing the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference was an error in judgment, which did not help the French."

    杜勒斯“又做了一件笨事”
    新华社柏林24日电　英国“曼彻斯特卫报”发表社论，评论杜勒斯1月17日在记者招待会上就他对“生活”杂志发表的谈话所作的声明。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”认为杜勒斯在记者招待会上的声明是“又做了一件笨事”，它指出杜勒斯在发表声明和回答问题的时候再一次修改了历史，使它符合于他自己的不完全的记忆。
    这家报纸抨击杜勒斯在声明中再度对中国人民发出的粗暴恫吓。它说：美国政府最好现在就取消任何保卫沿海岛屿的义务，因为大多数亚洲国家是同情中国的；虽然如此，这家报纸避而不谈中国人民所拥有的解放台湾的神圣权利。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”还说，如果杜勒斯承认“生活”杂志上的说法是错误的，原会是“更加适当的”。杜勒斯“原也可以作出修正，承认他抵制讨论印度支那问题的日内瓦会议是判断上的错误，这没有能帮助法国人。”
