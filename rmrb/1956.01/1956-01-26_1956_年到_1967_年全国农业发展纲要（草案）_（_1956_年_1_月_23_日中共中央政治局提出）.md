The high tide of agricultural cooperation throughout the country is triggering a new high tide in agricultural production, which in turn is promoting a new high tide in the entire national economy and in science, culture, education, and health. In order to provide long-term goals for the development of agriculture for leading Party and government organs at all levels and the people of the country, especially the peasants, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, after consulting with the responsible comrades of the Party committees of the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, has formulated a draft outline on the scale of national agricultural development from 1956 to 1967 (i.e., until the last year of the Third Five-Year Plan). This draft outline also touches on urban work in some related issues. In addition to stipulating several important indicators related to agricultural production, other indicators in this draft outline will be stipulated by each Five-Year Plan and annual plan. This draft is now being sent to the Party committees and relevant departments of provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions), special districts (autonomous prefectures), counties (autonomous counties), districts, and townships (ethnic townships) for study and to solicit opinions. At the same time, opinions should be widely solicited from workers, farmers, scientists, and patriotic people from all walks of life. All opinions should be collected before April 1, 1956, in order to submit them to the Seventh Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which is scheduled to be held after April 1, 1956, for discussion and adoption, as a proposal to be submitted to state organs and the people of the country, especially the peasants. With the exception of a few remote areas where democratic reforms have not yet been carried out, the Party and government leading organs of provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions), special districts (autonomous prefectures), counties (autonomous counties), districts, and townships (ethnic townships) throughout the country should, based on this draft outline and in accordance with the specific conditions of the locality, formulate specific plans for phased and batch-by-batch development of various tasks in the locality. At the same time, all economic departments, scientific, cultural, educational, health, and political and legal departments of the state should also re-examine their work plans based on this draft outline.

(1) On the basis of more than 60% of peasant households having joined agricultural producers' cooperatives in 1955, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions are required to basically complete the primary form of agricultural cooperation in 1956, reaching about 85% of peasant households joining agricultural producers' cooperatives.

(2) Areas with a good cooperative foundation and that have already established a number of advanced cooperatives are required to basically complete the advanced form of agricultural cooperation in 1957. The remaining areas are required to establish one to several large-scale (more than 100 households) advanced cooperatives in each district in 1956 as examples, and to basically complete the advanced form of agricultural cooperation in 1958.

The conditions that a primary cooperative should meet to upgrade to an advanced cooperative are: voluntary membership, strong leadership cadres, and an increase in income for more than 90% of the members after the transition to an advanced cooperative. For all primary cooperatives where conditions are ripe, they should be converted to advanced cooperatives in batches and phases. Failure to upgrade will hinder the development of productive forces.

(3) Agricultural producers' cooperatives should provide appropriate arrangements in production and life for widowed, orphaned, and childless peasant households and disabled soldiers who lack labor and have no means of support within the cooperative, ensuring food, clothing, fuel, education (for children and adolescents), and burial, so that these people have a reliable source of support for their entire lives.

(4) The issue of allowing former landlord elements and rich peasant elements who have abandoned exploitation to join the cooperative should begin to be addressed in 1956. The solutions are: (1) Those who perform well and are diligent in production may be allowed to join the cooperative as members and allowed to change their class status to peasants. (2) Those who perform generally, neither good nor bad, may be allowed to join the cooperative as probationary members and their class status will not be changed for the time being. (3) Those who perform badly will be placed under the control of the cooperative for production by the township people's committees; those who engage in destructive activities should also be subject to legal sanctions. (4) Former landlord and rich peasant elements, regardless of whether they have obtained the title of member, are not allowed to hold any important positions within the cooperative for a certain period of time after joining the cooperative. (5) Cooperatives should adopt the principle of equal pay for equal work for the labor of former landlord and rich peasant elements in the cooperative, giving them the labor income they deserve. (6) If the children of landlords and rich peasants were under the age of eighteen at the time of the land reform and were young students in school; or if they participated in labor before the land reform and were in a subordinate position in the family, such people should not be regarded as landlord and rich peasant elements, and they should be allowed to join the cooperative as members, called peasants, and assigned appropriate work according to their conditions.

(5) Counter-revolutionary elements in the countryside should be dealt with in accordance with the following provisions: (1) Elements who engage in sabotage activities and who have committed serious crimes in history that have aroused great public indignation should be arrested and brought to justice. (2) Elements who have only general historical crimes and who have no current sabotage activities and have not aroused great public indignation should be placed under the control of the cooperative for production and labor reform by the township people's committees. (3) Elements who have only minor crimes, have now repented, elements who have been released from prison and perform well, and elements who, although guilty, have made significant contributions to the suppression of counter-revolutionaries may be allowed to join the cooperative, and depending on the degree of their repentance and the magnitude of their contributions, some may be made members, have their counter-revolutionary labels removed, and be called peasants; others may be made probationary members and not given the title of peasant for the time being. However, regardless of whether they have obtained the title of member, they are not allowed to hold any important positions within the cooperative for a certain period of time after joining the cooperative. (4) Cooperatives should adopt the principle of equal pay for equal work for counter-revolutionary elements who are under the control of the cooperative for production, giving them the labor income they deserve. (5) The family members of counter-revolutionary elements, as long as they have not participated in criminal activities, should be allowed to join the cooperative and should be treated the same as ordinary members, without discrimination.

(6) Starting from 1956, within 12 years, the average annual grain yield per mu should be increased from more than 150 jin in 1955 to 400 jin in areas north of the Yellow River, Qinling Mountains, Bailong River, and Yellow River (within Qinghai); from 208 jin in 1955 to 500 jin in areas south of the Yellow River and north of the Huai River; and from 400 jin in 1955 to 800 jin in areas south of the Huai River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River.

Starting from 1956, within 12 years, the average annual cotton yield per mu (seed cotton) should be increased from 35 jin in 1955 (national average) to 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin, respectively, depending on local conditions.

While ensuring the completion of the state-specified planned targets for crops such as grain, cotton, soybeans, peanuts, rapeseed, sesame, hemp, flue-cured tobacco, silk, tea, sugarcane, sugar beets, fruits, oil tea, and tung oil, all localities should also actively develop all other marketable cash crops. Mountainous areas should also actively develop all marketable cash crops while ensuring grain self-sufficiency and having surplus grain for disaster preparedness. Areas with suitable conditions in the southern provinces of China should actively develop tropical crops.

Agricultural producers' cooperatives should encourage members to grow vegetables on their private plots to improve their lives. Farmers in suburban areas of cities and near industrial and mining areas should grow vegetables in a planned manner to fully ensure the supply of vegetables to cities and industrial and mining areas.

Develop medicinal herb production. Pay attention to protecting wild medicinal herbs and gradually convert them to artificial cultivation under possible conditions.

(7) In addition to the grain consumed by themselves and guaranteed to meet the needs of the state, all agricultural producers' cooperatives should, starting from 1956, store surplus grain sufficient for one year, one and a half years, or two years of consumption, respectively, depending on local conditions, to meet emergency needs. Provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions), special districts (autonomous prefectures), counties (autonomous counties), districts, townships (ethnic townships), and agricultural producers' cooperatives should all formulate specific plans to achieve this requirement. During the same period, the state should also store reserve grain sufficient for one to two years of use to meet emergency needs.

(8) Develop animal husbandry. Protect and breed cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, camels, pigs, sheep, and various poultry, paying special attention to protecting female animals and young animals, and improving breeds. Develop state-owned ranches.

Preventing animal diseases is an important task in breeding livestock. Within 7 or 12 years, in all possible places, it is required to basically eliminate the most serious animal diseases, such as rinderpest, hog cholera, chicken plague, porcine cysticercosis, bovine pleuropneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease, lamb dysentery, sheep scabies, and equine glanders. To this end, starting from 1956, within 7 years, counties in agricultural areas and districts in pastoral areas should establish animal husbandry and veterinary stations. Strengthen veterinary work. Cooperatives should have primary personnel for preventing and controlling animal diseases.

Pay attention to protecting grasslands, improving and cultivating forage grass, and promoting silage feed. Agricultural producers' cooperatives and pastoral producers' cooperatives should establish their own feed and forage bases.

(9) Adopting production-increasing measures and promoting advanced experience are the two basic conditions for increasing crop yields.

(A) The items of production-increasing measures mainly include: (1) Building water conservancy projects and maintaining water and soil. (2) Promoting new-style agricultural implements and gradually implementing agricultural mechanization. (3) Actively utilizing all possible conditions to open up fertilizer sources and improve the method of using fertilizer. (4) Promoting improved varieties. (5) Improving soil. (6) Expanding the multiple cropping area. (7) Planting more high-yield crops. (8) Improving cultivation methods. (9) Eliminating pests and diseases. (10) Reclaiming wasteland and expanding the cultivated area.

(B) The methods of promoting advanced experience mainly include: (1) Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should collect the typical high-yield models in local cooperatives, compile them into books, compile at least one book each year, and disseminate them quickly to facilitate promotion. (2) Hold agricultural exhibitions. (3) Provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions), special districts (autonomous prefectures), counties (autonomous counties), districts, and townships (ethnic townships) should regularly convene meetings of agricultural labor models to reward high-yield models. (4) Organize visits and competitions to exchange experience. (5) Organize technical training to mobilize peasants and cadres to actively learn advanced technologies.

(10) Build water conservancy projects and maintain water and soil. All small-scale water conservancy projects (such as digging wells, opening canals, digging ponds, building dams, etc.), the management of small rivers, and various soil and water conservation works should be carried out by local authorities and agricultural producers' cooperatives in a planned and massive manner. Through the above-mentioned work, combined with the construction of national large-scale water conservancy projects and the management of large and medium-sized rivers, it is required to basically eliminate ordinary floods and droughts within 7 to 12 years starting from 1956. The machinery manufacturing departments and commercial and supply and marketing cooperative departments should do a good job in supplying water lifting equipment such as water pumps, waterwheels, and locomobiles.

Under the unified plan for developing the mountain economy, the local authorities and agricultural producers' cooperatives are responsible for carrying out soil and water conservation work in conjunction with agricultural, animal husbandry, and forestry production. It is required that within 12 years, in all possible places, significant soil and water conservation effects should be achieved, and the hazards of soil erosion should be basically eliminated.

In all places where water sources can be utilized, it is required that a small hydropower station be built in each township or several townships within 12 years, starting from 1956, in order to gradually realize rural electrification in conjunction with the construction of national large-scale water conservancy and power projects.

(11) Promote new-style agricultural implements. Starting from 1956, within 3 to 5 years, promote 6 million double-wheel double-share plows and a corresponding number of seeders, cultivators, sprayers, powder sprayers, harvesters, threshers, chaff cutters, etc., and do a good job in repairing and fitting new-style agricultural implements. With the development of national industry, gradually implement agricultural mechanization.

(12) Starting from 1956, within 12 years, 90% or more of the fertilizer in most areas and 100% of the fertilizer in some areas should be solved by local authorities and agricultural producers' cooperatives themselves. To this end, all localities should be awakened to actively take all possible measures to increase fertilizer, paying special attention to raising pigs (paying attention to raising sheep in some places) and appropriately developing green manure crops. Local authorities should actively develop the manufacturing industry of phosphate fertilizer and potash fertilizer, actively develop bacterial fertilizers (soybean rhizobium, peanut rhizobium, etc.), and make full use of urban manure and miscellaneous fertilizer. At the same time, the state should actively develop the manufacturing industry of chemical fertilizers.

(13) Actively breed and promote improved varieties of crops suitable for the local area, and strengthen seed rejuvenation work. Starting from 1956, popularize improved cotton varieties within two to three years, and popularize improved varieties of major crops such as rice, wheat, corn, soybeans, millet, sorghum, potatoes, rapeseed, sesame, sugarcane, tobacco leaves, and hemp within 7 to 12 years. Agricultural producers' cooperatives should all establish their own seed plots. State-owned farms should become bases for breeding improved crop varieties.

(14) Agricultural producers' cooperatives should actively carry out the work of improving soil and use various methods to turn barren land into fertile farmland.

(15) Expand the multiple cropping area. Starting from 1956, within 12 years, the multiple cropping index of cultivated land should be increased to the following levels on average according to different regions: (1) Areas south of the Nanling Mountains are required to reach 230%. (2) Areas north of the Nanling Mountains and south of the Yangtze River are required to reach 200%. (3) Areas north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River are required to reach 160%. (4) Areas north of the Yellow River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River and south of the Great Wall are required to reach 120%. (5) Areas north of the Great Wall should also expand the multiple cropping area as much as possible.

(16) Plant more high-yield crops. First of all, increase the planting area of rice. All possible water sources should be utilized to plant more rice. Starting from 1956, within 12 years, it is required to increase 310 million mu of rice, 150 million mu of corn, and 100 million mu of potatoes.

(17) Improve cultivation methods. Deep plowing and careful cultivation, reasonable rotation, intercropping, and close planting, timely sowing, timely weeding, thinning seedlings to protect seedlings, and strengthening field management to achieve high yields and guaranteed harvests.

(18) Starting from 1956, within 7 or 12 years, in all possible places, basically eliminate the most serious pests and diseases that harm crops, such as locusts, armyworms, rice borers, corn borers, cotton aphids, red spiders, pink bollworms, wheat smut, wheat nematode disease, and sweet potato black rot. All localities should also include other major pests and diseases that can be eliminated in the local area in the elimination plan. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen plant protection work and plant quarantine work.

(19) The state should reclaim wasteland in a planned manner to expand the cultivated area. In areas with suitable conditions, cooperatives should be encouraged to organize branches to carry out reclamation work. When reclaiming wasteland, it must be combined with the plan to maintain water and soil to avoid the risk of soil erosion.

(20) Develop state-owned farms. Starting from 1956, within 12 years, the cultivated area of state-owned farms is required to increase from 13.36 million mu in 1955 to 140 million mu. It is necessary to actively improve the management and management of state-owned farms, increase production, practice strict economy, and reduce costs, so that state-owned farms can play their due role in demonstration in terms of production technology and management and management.

(21) Starting from 1956, within 12 years, green all possible barren land and barren mountains. In all housesides, villagesides, roadsides, watersides, as well as barren land and barren mountains, as long as possible, it is required to plant trees in a planned manner. To this end, in addition to the state establishing nurseries, agricultural producers' cooperatives are also required to establish nurseries of appropriate size to cultivate seedlings.

In addition to planting timber forests (including bamboo forests), economic forests such as mulberry, oak, tea, lacquer, fruit trees, and oil materials should be developed as much as possible.

In the greening plan, windbreak forests, sandbreak forests, farmland protection forests, water source forests, coastal defense forests, and urban protection forests must all be included.

The greening along railways, highways, and rivers is managed by the agricultural producers' cooperatives along the roads and rivers, and the income belongs to the cooperatives. The greening along railways and highways should be implemented in accordance with the specifications set by the railway and transportation departments.

Actively prevent and control forest pests and diseases, and strengthen forest protection and fire prevention work.

(22) Actively develop the production of marine aquatic products and freshwater aquaculture. In marine fisheries, safety measures in production should be strengthened, and development should be expanded to the deep sea. In freshwater aquaculture, the work of cultivating improved fish species and preventing fish diseases should be strengthened.

(23) In order to fully develop the production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, increase social wealth and farmers' income, cooperatives must improve the utilization rate of labor and labor productivity. Starting from 1956, within 7 years, it is required that every male full laborer in rural areas do at least 250 workdays per year. Actively mobilize women to participate in agricultural and sideline production labor. In addition to the time spent on housework, it is required that every female full laborer in rural areas spend no less than 120 workdays per year on productive labor within 7 years. In addition, it is also required that all people with semi-labor or people who can do light labor in rural areas actively participate in labor suitable for their abilities. At the same time, we should also actively improve production technology, improve labor organization and labor management, and continuously improve the labor productivity of cooperative members through these measures.

(24) All agricultural producers' cooperatives must implement the principle of running cooperatives diligently and frugally. Diligence means fully mobilizing members to work diligently in production, expanding the scope of production, developing diversified economies, and carrying out meticulous work. Frugality means practicing strict economy, reducing production costs, and opposing extravagance and waste. The basic construction of cooperatives should make full use of the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the cooperatives themselves as much as possible.

(25) Improve living conditions. With the development of cooperative production and the increase of members' income, in order to facilitate members' engagement in production activities and political and cultural activities, and to improve members' sanitary environment, agricultural producers' cooperatives should, according to needs and possibilities, encourage and assist members to repair and build new family homes in a prepared and planned manner in batches and phases under the principles of voluntariness and economy, and improve members' living conditions.

(26) Starting from 1956, within 7 or 12 years, basically eliminate the most serious diseases that endanger the people in all possible places, such as schistosomiasis, filariasis, hookworm disease, kala-azar, encephalitis, plague, malaria, smallpox, and venereal diseases. Other diseases, such as measles, dysentery, typhoid fever, diphtheria, trachoma, tuberculosis, leprosy, goiter, and rickets, should also be actively prevented and treated. To this end, medical personnel should be actively trained, and county and district health care institutions and rural medical stations should be established in batches.

(27) Eliminate the four pests. Starting from 1956, within 5 years, 7 years, or 12 years, basically eliminate rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes in all possible places.

(28) Strengthen agricultural scientific research and technical guidance work, and train a large number of agricultural technical cadres in a planned manner. Systematically establish, enrich, and strengthen the institutions of agricultural scientific research and technical guidance work, such as agricultural science academies, regional and specialized agricultural science research institutes, provincial agricultural experiment stations, county demonstration breeding farms, and district agricultural technology extension stations, so that agricultural scientific research and technical guidance work can better serve the development of agricultural production. Starting from 1956, within 12 years, the agricultural departments at all levels are responsible for training 5 million to 6 million primary and intermediate technical cadres (including agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, production management, and accounting, etc.) for agricultural producers' cooperatives, in order to meet the needs of the development of the cooperative economy.

(29) Starting from 1956, according to local conditions, basically eliminate illiteracy within 5 or 7 years. The standard for eliminating illiteracy is to recognize more than 1,500 characters. And establish spare-time cultural schools in every township in order to further improve the cultural level of rural grassroots cadres and farmers. According to local conditions, popularize compulsory primary education within 7 or 12 years. Rural primary schools are basically run by agricultural producers' cooperatives. Basically popularize the rural cultural network within 7 or 12 years, and establish cultural organizations such as film projection teams, clubs, cultural stations, libraries, and amateur drama groups. Basically achieve that every township has a sports field within 7 or 12 years and popularize rural sports activities.

(30) Starting from 1956, according to local conditions, basically popularize the rural broadcasting network within 7 or 12 years. All townships and large agricultural, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, salt industry, and handicraft producers' cooperatives are required to install tools for listening to wired or wireless broadcasts.

(31) Starting from 1956, according to local conditions, complete the telephone network of townships and large cooperatives within 7 or 12 years. Set up radio telephones where necessary. Popularize the rural postal network within 7 years and do a good job in postal transmission and newspaper and magazine distribution.

(32) Starting from 1956, according to local conditions, basically build a national local road network within 5, 7, or 12 years, repairing the roads between provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions), special districts (autonomous prefectures), counties (autonomous counties), districts, and townships (ethnic townships) according to the specifications set by the transportation departments, and doing a good job in regular maintenance.

Where there are rivers that can be navigable, the waterways should be organized and dredged under possible conditions to facilitate transportation.

(33) Starting from 1956, according to local conditions, basically build a hydrological and meteorological station network within 7 or 12 years, and strengthen the work of dangerous weather forecasts and agricultural weather forecasts. All localities should pay attention to listening to broadcasts about meteorology in order to prevent natural disasters such as water, drought, wind, and frost.

(34) The cooperation of the national handicraft industry and the cooperation of salt farmers, fishermen, and boat dwellers are required to be basically completed in 1957. The cooperation of animal husbandry should stipulate development plans according to local conditions.

(35) Commercial departments and rural supply and marketing cooperatives are required to complete the work of adjusting the rural commercial network within 1957, strengthen the planning of commodity circulation, and ensure that the work of commodity supply and agricultural product purchase in rural areas is done well.

Health departments should train midwives for rural areas, actively promote new methods of delivery, protect mothers, and reduce the morbidity rate of mothers and the mortality rate of infants.

With the development of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production and the further improvement of farmers' lives, appropriate regulations and restrictions should be made on rural children participating in auxiliary labor according to their age and physical strength.

(38) Give play to the labor enthusiasm of rural youth and the enthusiasm for learning culture and learning science and technology. Rural youth should become activists and shock forces in rural production and scientific and cultural undertakings.

(39) Starting from 1956, according to local conditions, solve the unemployment problem in cities within 5 or 7 years, so that the existing urban unemployed people can all get employment opportunities. In addition to being able to be employed in cities, their employment paths are to go to the suburbs, to the countryside, to the reclamation areas, or to the mountainous areas to participate in various production undertakings such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and rural scientific, cultural, educational, and health undertakings.

(40) Urban workers and cooperative farmers must support each other. Workers should produce more and better industrial products to meet the needs of farmers. Farmers should produce more and better grain and industrial raw materials to meet the needs of industry and urban residents. Urban workers and cooperative farmers should also establish regular contacts through methods such as get-togethers, visits, and correspondence, encourage each other, and exchange experiences with each other, so as to be conducive to the development of industry and agriculture and to the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class.

    1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）
    （1956年1月23日中共中央政治局提出）
    全国农业合作化的高潮正在引起全国农业生产的高潮，并转而促进整个国民经济和科学、文化、教育、卫生事业的新的高潮。为了使各级党政领导机关和全国人民，首先是农民，对于农业的发展有一个长期奋斗的目标，中国共产党中央委员会政治局在同党的各省委、市委、自治区党委的负责同志商量之后，拟定了一个关于从1956年到1967年（即到第三个五年计划的最后一年）的全国农业发展规模的纲要的草案。这个纲要草案在某些有关的问题上，也说到城市工作。这个纲要草案除了规定有关农业生产的若干重要指标以外，其他指标将由各个五年计划和年度计划去规定。现在将这个草案发给各省（市、自治区）、专区（自治州）、县（自治县）、区、乡（民族乡）的党委以及各有关部门研究，并征求意见。同时，应当广泛地征求工人、农民、科学家和各界爱国人士的意见。于1956年4月1日以前，将各方面的意见收集起来，以便提交准备于1956年4月1日以后开会的中国共产党第七届中央委员会第七次全体会议（扩大）讨论和通过，作为向国家机关和全国人民，首先是农民提出的建议。除了一部分尚未进行民主改革的边远地区以外，全国各省（市、自治区）、专区（自治州）、县（自治县）、区、乡（民族乡）的党政领导机关，应当根据本纲要草案，并按照本地方的具体条件，分别拟定本地方的各项工作的分期分批发展的具体规划。同时，国家各个经济部门、各个科学、文化、教育、卫生部门和政法部门也都应当根据本纲要草案，重新审订自己的工作规划。
    （一）在1955年已经有60％以上的农户加入农业生产合作社的基础上，要求各省、市、自治区在1956年基本上完成初级形式的农业合作化，达到85％左右的农户加入农业生产合作社。
    （二）要求合作基础较好并且已经办了一批高级社的地区，在1957年基本上完成高级形式的农业合作化。其余地区，则要求在1956年，每区办一个至几个大型（100户以上）的高级社，以作榜样，在1958年基本上完成高级形式的农业合作化。
    初级社升高级社，应该具备的条件是：社员自愿，有较强的领导干部，并且在转为高级社以后，90％以上的社员都能增加收入。对于一切条件成熟了的初级社，应当分批分期地使它们转为高级社。不升级就将妨碍生产力的发展。
    （三）农业生产合作社对于社内缺乏劳动力，生活无依靠的鳏寡孤独的农户和残废军人，应当在生产上和生活上给以适当的安排，做到保吃、保穿、保烧（燃料）、保教（儿童和少年）、保葬，使这些人的生养死葬都有指靠。
    （四）对于过去的地主分子和已经放弃剥削的富农分子要求入社的问题，在1956年内应当开始着手解决。解决的办法是：（1）表现较好，勤劳生产的，可以允许他们入社，做为社员，并且允许他们改变成分，称为农民。（2）表现一般，不好不坏的，允许他们入社，做为候补社员，暂不改变成分。（3）表现坏的，由乡人民委员会交合作社管制生产；有破坏行为的，还应当受到法律的制裁。（4）过去的地主富农分子，无论是否已经取得社员的称号，在入社以后的一定时期内，都不许担任社内任何重要的职务。（5）合作社对于过去的地主富农分子在社内的劳动，应当采取同工同酬的原则，给他们以应有的劳动所得。（6）地主富农的子女，如果在土地改革的时候，他还是年龄不满十八岁的少年儿童和在学校读书的青年学生；或者在土地改革以前，他就参加劳动，并且在家庭中居于被支配的地位，这种人不应当当做地主富农分子看待，而应当允许他们入社，做为社员，称为农民，并且根据他们的条件，分配适当的工作。
    （五）对于农村中的反革命分子，应当按照以下的规定加以处理：（1）进行破坏活动的分子和在历史上有严重罪行民愤很大的分子，逮捕法办。（2）只有一般的历史罪行，没有现行破坏活动民愤不大的分子，由乡人民委员会交合作社管制生产，劳动改造。（3）只有轻微罪行，现在已经悔改的分子，刑满释放表现好的分子，以及虽有罪行，但是对于镇压反革命立有显著功劳的分子，可以允许他们入社，并且根据他悔改的程度和功劳的大小，有的做为社员，摘掉反革命帽子，称为农民；有的做为候补社员，暂不给以农民的称号。但是，无论是否已经取得社员的称号，在入社以后的一定时期内，都不许担任社内任何重要的职务。（4）对于交合作社管制生产的反革命分子，合作社应当采取同工同酬的原则，给他们以应有的劳动所得。（5）对于反革命分子的家属，只要他们没有参与犯罪行为，应当允许他们入社，并且应当同一般社员同等待遇，不要歧视他们。
    （六）从1956年开始，在12年内，粮食每亩平均年产量，在黄河、秦岭、白龙江、黄河（青海境内）以北地区，由1955年的150多斤增加到400斤；黄河以南、淮河以北地区，由1955年的208斤增加到500斤；淮河、秦岭、白龙江以南地区，由1955年的400斤增加到800斤。
    从1956年开始，在12年内，棉花每亩平均年产量（皮棉），按照各地情况，由1955年的35斤（全国平均数）分别增加到60斤、80斤和100斤。
    各地在保证完成国家所规定的粮食、棉花、大豆、花生、油菜籽、芝麻、麻类、烤烟、丝、茶、甘蔗、甜菜、果类、油茶、油桐等项农作物的计划指标的条件下，还应当积极地发展其他一切有销路的经济作物。大山区在保证粮食自给并且有余粮备荒的条件下，也应当积极地发展一切有销路的经济作物。华南各省有条件的地区，应当积极发展热带作物。
    农业生产合作社应当鼓励社员在自留地上种植蔬菜，改善自己的生活。城市郊区和工矿区附近的农民应当有计划地种植蔬菜，充分地保证城市和工矿区的蔬菜供应。
