    Educate the Commune Members Not to Eat the Seeds
    In the Luxinhe Township in the suburbs of Tianjin, many farmers, after joining the agricultural cooperative, even used the wheat seeds they had originally saved for spring planting to grind into flour and eat. They thought that after joining the cooperative, everything would be resolved by the cooperative, and even if they ate the wheat seeds, the government would provide loans.
    After discovering this problem, the Party branch and the cooperative establishment work team immediately educated the commune members, making everyone understand that the cooperative's seeds should be collected by themselves. If everyone eats the wheat seeds and relies on the government to allocate them from other places, it will not only increase transportation costs, but also the seeds transferred from other places may not be suitable for local growth, which is not beneficial to the country or to themselves. This reversed the commune members' mentality of dependence. Those commune members who originally planned to eat the wheat seeds stopped doing so, and they handed over the wheat seeds to the cooperative for unified handling.

　　教育社员不要吃掉种子
    天津市郊区芦新河乡有不少农民入社以后，把原来留着春天用的麦种也拿来磨面吃了。他们以为入了社，一切事社里都会解决，吃掉了麦种政府也会贷给。
    党支部和建社工作组发现了这个问题，立即对社员进行了教育。使大家知道：社里的种子应该自己筹集，如果大家都把麦种吃掉了，靠政府从别处调拨，既增加了运费，而且外地调来的种子也不一定适合本地生长，对国家对自己都没有好处。这样就扭转了社员的依赖思想。那些原来打算吃麦种的社员都不吃了，他们把麦种交给社里统一处理。
