Xinhua News Agency, January 14th. The Central Handicraft Administration Bureau and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Production Cooperatives have issued a notice to local handicraft administration bureaus and handicraft production cooperative federations, requiring them to establish handicraft cooperatives in market towns and rural areas to prepare for the upcoming spring plowing season.

The notice emphasized: Handicraft industries below the county level must be oriented towards rural areas, serving the needs of agricultural production and farmers' lives. The transformation of rural handicrafts must be closely coordinated with agricultural cooperativization. Currently, priority should be given to organizing ironworking, woodworking, and construction repair industries to vigorously repair and manufacture various new and old farm tools and carry out small-scale construction projects.

The notice said: Market towns are the political and economic centers of rural areas. Handicraft cooperatives should be established with market towns as the base, and fixed farm tool repair stations and mobile repair teams should be organized according to the surrounding rural conditions. Repair scopes should be divided, and responsibilities should be assigned for repair work. At the same time, large-scale production cooperatives should be established with counties as the center to lead farm tool repair, manufacture farm tool parts, master the technology of repairing new-style farm tools, and train technical personnel. Where possible, necessary lathes, electric welding (or gas welding), drilling machines, and other tool equipment can be added. The required technical personnel can be solved through short-term training or hiring technicians to teach. The notice also emphasized: Attention must be paid to improving quality and reasonably setting prices during repairs. Contracts or agreements must be signed with agricultural production cooperatives, and both parties must abide by them.

    中央手工业管理部门发出通知
    在集镇和农村发展手工业合作社
    新华社14日讯  中央手工业管理局和中华全国手工业生产合作社联合总社筹备委员会已向各地手工业管理局和手工业生产合作社联合社发出通知，要求各地在集镇和农村建立手工业合作社，为迎接春耕生产作好准备。
    通知着重指出：县以下手工业要面向农村，为农业生产和农民生活需要服务。农村手工业改造必须与农业合作化紧密配合进行。当前首先要将铁业、木业和建筑修缮业组织起来，大力进行修配和制造各式新、旧农具及进行小型修建工作。
    通知说：集镇是农村的政治经济中心，应该以集镇为基点建立手工业合作社，并按照周围农村的情况，组织固定的农具修配站和流动修配小组，划分修配范围，分工负责进行修配工作。同时，要以县为中心建立领导农具修配的大型生产合作社，制造农具零件，掌握修配新式农具的技术，训练技术人材。在可能的情况下，可添置必要的车床、电焊（或气焊）、钻床等工具设备。所需技术人材，可通过短期训练或聘请技师传授等办法解决。通知还强调：在修配中必须注意提高质量，合理规定价格，并与农业生产合作社订立合同或协议，双方遵照执行。
