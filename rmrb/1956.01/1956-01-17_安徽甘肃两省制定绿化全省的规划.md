Anhui and Gansu provinces have formulated plans to achieve province-wide greening.

    Anhui Province requires that the Huaibei Plain area, which is rich in wheat, be greened within 4 years; the Huainan hilly area be greened within 4 to 7 years; and the Dabie Mountain area and the southern Anhui Huangshan Mountain area be greened within 5 to 7 years. Afforestation tasks in urban areas, scenic spots, along roads and rivers, around towns and villages, and in industrial and mining areas throughout the province should be completed within two to five years.

    Gansu Province requires that the task of basically greening the entire province be completed within 12 years. Within these 12 years, more than 150 million mu of forests will be planted throughout the province. According to the plan, starting from Huan County in eastern Gansu, passing through Yanchi, Jingtai, Yumen, Dunhuang, and ending at Xingxingxia, a 2,300-kilometer-long windbreak forest belt will be built to prevent wind and sand from encroaching southward, in order to protect crops. Large areas of water conservation forests will be created on the Qilian Mountains south of the Hexi Corridor and in the upper reaches of the Yellow River tributaries. In the arid areas of central Gansu and the mountainous and rainy Wudu area, timber forests and economic forests will also be planted to solve the problem of building materials and fuel for local farmers, and to increase the income of farmers in mountainous areas. This year, Gansu Province will afforest 4 million mu, and a large-scale mass afforestation movement is about to begin in the spring.

    安徽甘肃两省制定绿化全省的规划
    安徽和甘肃两省已经制定了实现全省绿化的规划。
    安徽省要求盛产小麦的淮北平原地区在4年内实现绿化；淮南丘陵地区在4年到7年内实现绿化；大别山区和皖南黄山区在5年到7年内实现绿化。全省市区，风景区，道路、河流两旁，城镇、村庄周围以及工矿区，在两年到5年内要完成植树造林任务。
    甘肃省要求在12年内基本完成绿化全省的任务。在这12年内，全省将造林1.5亿多亩。按照规划，从甘肃东部的环县开始，向西经盐池、景泰、玉门、敦煌到星星峡，将营造一条长2，300多公里的防沙林带，制止风沙向南侵袭，以保护农作物。在河西走廊南边的祁连山上和黄河支流的上游地区，将营造大面积的水源林。在中部干旱地区和高山多雨的武都专区，还将种植用材林和经济林，以解决当地农民建筑用材和燃料问题，并增加山区农民的收入。今年，甘肃省将要造林400万亩，一个大规模的群众性的造林运动，就要在春季开始。
