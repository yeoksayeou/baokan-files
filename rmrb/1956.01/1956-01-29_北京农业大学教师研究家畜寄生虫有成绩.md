Teachers at the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department of Beijing Agricultural University have made achievements in the study of livestock parasites.

Professor Xiong Dashi, head of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department of Beijing Agricultural University, and his assistants have completed a research paper on nodular worms, a parasite of Chinese livestock. This study has certain significance for the exploration of parasitology theory and for livestock breeding and maintenance.

Nodular worms are very harmful to livestock, and no systematic research had been conducted in China in the past. Xiong Dashi and teachers of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department, such as Kong Fanyao, began collecting many parasite specimens from various pastures, slaughterhouses, and agricultural and forestry colleges for research starting in 1954, and completed the paper on nodular worms in November 1955. They conducted a detailed analysis of the types of nodular worms in major livestock such as pigs, cattle, and sheep, and their life cycles. When Xiong Dashi was identifying sheep parasite specimens in Lanzhou, he also discovered a new species, "Gansu Nodular Worm," adding new content to the world's parasitology research.

Under the leadership of Professor Xiong Dashi, teachers in the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department of Beijing Agricultural University have also completed research on a new parasitic nematode in Chinese sheep and goats. This nematode parasitizes in the large intestine of sheep, damaging their health. The teachers have studied its life cycle.

    北京农业大学教师研究家畜寄生虫有成绩
    北京农业大学畜牧兽医系系主任熊大仕教授和他的助手们已完成关于中国家畜寄生虫——结节虫的研究论文，在寄生虫学理论的探讨和家畜繁殖、保养方面都有一定的意义。
    结节虫对家畜的危害很大，中国过去还没有作过系统的研究。熊大仕和畜牧兽医系教师孔繁瑶等从1954年开始在各地牧场、屠宰场和高等农林学校采集了许多寄生虫标本进行研究，到1955年11月完成结节虫的论文。他们对猪、牛、羊等主要家畜结节虫的种类和它的生活规律作了详细的分析。熊大仕在兰州鉴定绵羊寄生虫标本时，还发现了一个新种——“甘肃结节虫”，为世界寄生虫学研究增加了新的内容。
    北京农业大学畜牧兽医系教师在熊大仕教授领导下，还完成中国绵羊和山羊的一种新寄生线虫的研究。这种线虫寄生在羊的大肠里，损害羊的健康。教师们已研究出它的生活规律。
