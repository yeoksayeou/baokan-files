Party Organizations Should Lead Labor Emulation Well
	Guo Yi

    At the beginning of the winter of 1955, the Party organization of the 101st Work Zone of the First Engineering Company, formerly under the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau, faced an arduous task: The workload of the work zone's winter construction was equal to 103% of the task during the warm season of 1955. The structure of the project was complex, and the technical requirements were strict. How would the Party organization of the work zone ensure the completion of this task? They tightly grasped the crucial aspect of labor emulation.

    At that time, cadres and workers lacked confidence in completing the winter construction task, and some even had thoughts of retreat. In response to this situation, the first step taken by the Party organization was to mobilize all Party members. Each branch held a general meeting of Party members, criticizing the idea of retreating in the face of difficulties. The general meeting of Party members passed a resolution to guarantee the completion of the winter construction task, and the branches and individual Party members all made work plans. After the meeting, many Party members put their promises into practice. 12 out of 14 Party groups in the second work section exceeded their quotas; all Party members in the prefabrication section exceeded their quotas.

    When conducting ideological education work among the workers, the Party organization highlighted the significance of the high tide of the agricultural cooperative movement, calling on all workers to support the cooperative movement with practical actions of breaking new quotas. Many workers were deeply moved after hearing about the scenes of agricultural socialist transformation. They said, "We must break the quota, otherwise we will fall behind our peasant brothers." In this way, various thoughts of retreat were quickly overcome.

    Next, the Party organization went deep into the masses and strengthened specific guidance on labor emulation. Formulating an emulation plan was an important task, and the plan had to be advanced and feasible. The Party organization grasped this task at that time, helping each group to formulate a good plan. For example, the prefabrication section branch helped the Yuan Tianzuo group formulate a guarantee plan based on the specific situation of their group. The branch also helped this group divide into mutual aid groups, and launched a competition between individuals and between mutual aid groups. As a result, each group exceeded the new quota in the first half of December.

    There are many problems in the process of labor emulation, which must be solved in a timely manner. The first problem encountered was that the tasks of each work section and group changed frequently, workers were transferred frequently, and materials were not supplied in time, which affected workers' ability to reach the quota. In order to overcome this shortcoming, the Party organization mobilized everyone to conduct inspections. The general meeting of Party members discussed this issue and made a resolution, ordering Party members in administrative leadership positions to strengthen planning, be clear about the situation, and ensure that task lists were issued to groups one to two days in advance; at the same time, they should ensure the timely supply of materials and tools, so that everything needed was available. The Party organization also held two symposiums for engineering management personnel, proposing more than ten work systems. In addition, each branch went deep into the work site, discovered problems and solved them in a timely manner.

    The second problem encountered in the labor emulation was the conservative thinking of the workers regarding the use of new technical equipment. In September, the work zone was transferred a steel bending machine by the company. Workers could increase their workload by using this machine. However, many workers believed that the machine did not work as fast as people, so they were unwilling to use it. Technicians believed that the workers' technical skills were too low to master the machine. Several technical research meetings did not solve this problem. At this time, the branch first conducted an experiment in the Shen Linchong group. The result was not good, and they could only bend one steel bar at a time. Two people bent only 108 steel bars in a whole day. The next day, the branch selected two youth groups in the Guo Shannan group for the experiment. Because these young people quickly found the key to mastering the use of the machine, they could bend 4 to 6 steel bars each time, and the workload exceeded the manual quota by 180%. The facts convinced the masses, and each group scrambled to use the machine.

    Helping backward groups catch up is an important task for Party organizations in leading labor emulation. At that time, some cadres adopted a hands-off attitude towards backward groups. After discovering this situation, the general branch immediately held a meeting of branch secretaries, criticizing this kind of thinking within the Party and studying how to do the work of backward groups well. After research, it was decided to carry out the work in three steps for backward groups. The first step was to understand the situation and discover activists or relatively active members from these groups; the second step was to study the reasons for not completing the task and propose ways to complete the task; the third step was to help formulate group plans and help them overcome various difficulties in their work. Each branch carried out in-depth and meticulous work on backward groups according to the requirements of the general branch. The Zhang Shulian group of the Second Work Section had not been able to reach the quota for a long time. The branch and all the members of this group held three meetings. The first meeting analyzed the situation; the second meeting studied the methods of improvement; the third meeting formulated a plan and carried out specific division of labor. The branch also stipulated that Party members in this group should report the production situation to the branch once a day, so as to discover problems and solve them in a timely manner. This enabled the group to increase from only completing 80% of the quota to 125.87%. The cement worker Liu Huaizhen group of the prefabrication section could only reach about 70% of the quota for more than two months. After the specific help of the branch, this group broke the new quota in half a month.

    In December 1955, this work zone completed 142.8% of the national plan indicators; the key projects were completed 132.66%. This is the result of the Party organization of the work zone leading the labor emulation.

    党组织要领导好劳动竞赛
    郭毅
    1955年冬季开始时，在原华北太原工程局所属第一工程公司一零一工区党组织的面前，摆着一个艰巨的任务：工区冬季施工的工作量等于1955年暖季施工任务的103％，工程的结构复杂，技术要求严格。工区党组织怎样来保证完成这一任务呢？他们紧紧地抓住了劳动竞赛这个环节。
    当时干部和工人对完成冬季施工任务的信心不足，甚至还有退缩思想。针对这种情况，党组织第一步工作是把全体党员动员起来。各分支部都召开了党员大会，批判在困难面前退缩的思想。党员大会做出了保证完成冬季施工任务的决议，支部和党员个人都订出了工作计划。会后，许多党员实践了自己的诺言，第二工段14个党
  小组就有12个组突破了定额；预制工段全体党员都突破了定额。
    党组织在对工人群众进行思想教育工作的时候，突出地讲解了农业合作化运动高潮到来的意义，号召全体工人用突破新定额的实际行动来支援合作化运动。许多工人听了农业社会主义改造的情景后都深受感动，他们说：“我们一定要突破定额，否则落在农民弟兄后面了。”这样，各种退缩思想很快就被克服了。
    接着，党组织深入群众，加强了对劳动竞赛的具体指导。订竞赛计划是一个重要的工作，计划既要先进，也要可行。党组织当时抓住了这个工作，帮助各小组来订好计划。如预制段支部帮助袁天佐小组根据本小组的具体情况，制定出了保证计划。支部还帮助这个小组划分了互助小组，开展了个人与个人、互助小组与互助小组之间的竞赛。这样各组12月上半月就都突破了新定额。
    劳动竞赛过程中的问题是很多的，必须及时予以解决。首先遇到的问题是各工段小组任务经常变更，工人调动频繁，材料供应不上，这会影响工人达到定额。为了克服这个缺点，党组织发动大家进行了检查。党员大会讨论了这个问题并做出了决议，责成担任行政领导的党员加强计划性，做到心中有数，保证任务单提前一天到两天下达小组；同时要保证材料、工具及时供应，做到要啥有啥。党组织又召开了两次工程管理人员座谈会，提出了十多条工作制度。此外，各支部又深入现场，发现问题及时加以解决。
    在劳动竞赛中碰到的第二个问题是工人群众对采用新的技术设备有保守思想。工区9月份由公司调来一部钢筋弯曲机。工人使用这种机器，就可以提高工作量。但是有不少工人却认为机器工作不如人快，所以不愿使用。而技师则认为工人技术太低无法掌握机器。开了几次技术研究会也没有解决这个问题。这时，支部就先在沈林冲小组进行试验。结果不好，每次只能弯一根，两个人整整弯了一天，才弯曲了108根。第二天，支部又在郭山南小组选择了两个青年小组进行试验。由于这些青年很快地找到了掌握使用机器的关键，结果每次可弯曲4根到6根，工作量超过了人工定额180％。事实说服了群众，各小组争先使用机器。
    帮助落后小组赶上去，这是党组织领导劳动竞赛的一个重要工作。当时有些干部对落后小组采取了撒手不管的态度。总支部发现这种情况后，立即召开了分支部书记会议，批判党内这种思想，并研究如何做好落后小组的工作。经研究后决定对落后小组分三步进行工作，第一步是了解情况，并从这些小组中发现积极分子或比较积极的分子；第二步是研究完不成任务的原因，提出完成任务的办法；第三步是帮助制定小组计划，帮助他们克服工作中的各种困难。各分支都根据总支的要求对落后小组做了深入而细致的工作。二工段张书连小组很长时间内达不到定额。支部和这个组的全体组员开了三次会，第一次会分析情况；第二次会研究改进办法；第三次会订出计划，进行具体分工。支部又规定这个小组的党员每天向支部汇报一次生产情况，以便及时发现问题加以解决。这样就使这个组从原来只能完成定额80％提高到125.87％。预制段水泥工刘怀珍小组两个多月只能达到定额的70％左右，经过分支部的具体帮助，这个组在半个月内就突破了新的定额。
    这个工区1955年12月份完成了国家计划指标的142.8％；重点工程完成了132.66％。这就是工区党组织领导劳动竞赛取得的成果。
