In their ranks were many ivory carvers, embroidery experts, and cloisonné ware makers, whose creations have always enjoyed a high international reputation and are a medium for cultural exchange between our country and the people of various countries. The organization of handicraft production cooperatives is accelerating, and many new members have already started production. In front of the capitalists' contingent, there was a huge sign that read: "Give up exploitation, learn skills, and strive to be a self-reliant laborer." They proposed that under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, they would continue to advance towards socialism together with people from all walks of life. The families of capitalists, who were praised by all sectors in this joint public-private partnership, also came to participate in the celebration.

At 3:15 p.m., after Chairman Mao accepted the reports of good news from representatives of workers, shop assistants, farmers, handicraftsmen, and industrialists and businessmen, the recreational activities of the celebration rally began.

More than 200,000 happy people, extending from Tiananmen Square to Zhongshan Park and East and West Chang'an Street, were singing and dancing everywhere, the sound of gongs and drums shook the sky, and celebrated our capital's rapid entry into socialist society.
