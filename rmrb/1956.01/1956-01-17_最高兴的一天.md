On the morning of January 12th, Peace Road in Xi'an City was filled with the sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers. A parade of over 1,600 people set off from here. More than 50 red flags fluttered in the morning breeze. People held high large characters meaning "Double Happiness", giant portraits of Chairman Mao, and large banners with slogans like "Marching Towards Socialism." This was a celebration parade from employees of 11 industries including machine manufacturing, pig iron casting, and photography to celebrate the transition to joint state-private ownership.

The entire street was immersed in jubilation. Crowds thronged the roadside, passengers on buses, all applauded the parade; shop assistants ran out of stores to wave and congratulate the parade, and some even set off firecrackers to add to the festive atmosphere.

Next to the Bell Tower, the employees' parade merged with the capitalists' parade. At this time, cheers of "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Socialism!" and the sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers resounded as one. Led by the employees' parade, the two teams went to report the good news to the provincial and municipal Party and government organizations.

In these joyful days, the workers' labor enthusiasm was even higher. All the employees of many factories joined the celebration parade and marched in the streets. They decided to take time out to make up for the production tasks of this day. Some factories with urgent tasks sent representatives to participate in the parade, leaving others behind to ensure normal production. The Qunsheng Electrical Hardware Repair Factory sent six representatives to participate in the employees' parade, and the remaining workers rushed to repair machines for the construction site. The Guangxingcheng File Manufacturing Factory had 14 workers, who used to produce 100 small files a day. On January 12th, the factory left 9 workers, who not only completed the tasks of all 14 people but also produced 10 extra files. Encouraged by the joint state-private ownership of the industry, Tong Shengde, a worker at the Huaxin Machinery Repair Factory, completed the production of a current transformer, which he had planned to make in three days, in just one day on January 12th.

All the employees of the 11 industries, including machine manufacturing and photography, called January 12th "the happiest day." On this day, the provincial and municipal Party and government leaders and the people of the city warmly congratulated them, encouraging them to accelerate the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and make further achievements in completing the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The employees and capitalists responded loudly to the call of the Party and the government. The employees said: Joint state-private ownership has brought us great encouragement and stimulated our labor enthusiasm. We will use our firm determination and confidence to ensure that both joint state-private ownership and production and operation are not neglected. The capitalists expressed: We are grateful for the correct leadership of the Party and the government, sincerely obey the leadership of the public side, earnestly accept transformation, work hard, and are determined to transform ourselves into self-reliant socialist citizens.

    最高兴的一天
    12日清晨，西安市和平路上锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣。一支1，600多人的队伍从这里出发了。50多面红旗在晨风中招展。人们高举着大“?”字、毛主席巨像，和“向社会主义进军”的大型标语牌。这是机器制造、生铁铸造、照像等11个行业的职工庆祝公私合营的报喜队。
    整个街道浸没在欢腾中。路旁簇拥的人群、公共汽车上的乘客，都向报喜队鼓掌；店员们也跑出商店向报喜队招手祝贺，有的还燃放鞭炮给报喜队添增喜气。
    在钟楼旁边，职工报喜队和资本家的报喜队汇合了。这时，“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“社会主义万岁！”的欢呼声和锣鼓、鞭炮声，响成一片。这两支队伍，由职工报喜队领先，去向省和市的党、政机关报喜。
    在这欢乐的日子里，职工们的劳动热情更高了。许多工厂的全体职工参加报喜队，在街上游行庆祝。这一天的生产任务，他们决定要抽出时间加工补上。有些有紧急任务的工厂，职工们派代表参加游行，留下人来，保证生产正常进行。群生电工五金修制厂的职工推出6个代表参加职工报喜队，其余的工人给工地赶修机器。广兴成修造锉刀厂有14个工人，过去一天生产100把小锉刀，12日厂里留了9个工人，除把全厂14个人的任务全部完成以外，还增产了10把锉刀。华新机械修造厂工人佟盛德在行业公私合营的鼓舞下，把计划3天做成的一台电流互感器，在12日一天中制成了。
    机器制造、照像等11个行业的全体从业人员，把12日叫做“最高兴的一天”。这一天，省和市的党、政首长和全市人民，热烈地向他们祝贺，勉励他们加速完成资本主义工商业的社会主义改造和提前完成第一个五年计划做出进一步的成绩来。职工们和资本家响亮地回答了党和政府的号召。职工们说：公私合营给我们带来了巨大的鼓舞，也激发了我们的劳动热情。我们要以坚定的决心和信心，保证公私合营和生产经营两不误。资本家表示：感激党和政府的正确领导，热诚地服从公方领导，认真地接受改造，努力劳动，立志把自己改变成为一个自食其力的社会主义公民。
