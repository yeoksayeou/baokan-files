Water and Soil Conservation Work Intensified in the Yellow River and Other Basins

Winter water and soil conservation work is being accelerated in the Yellow River, Hai River, and other basins.

In the loess plateau along the Yellow River in Shanxi Province, and in the mountainous areas upstream of the Sanggan River, Hutuo River, and Zhang River, which belong to the Hai River water system, nearly one million farmers have broken with convention and engaged in water and soil conservation work during the winter. They have already built more than 88,000 mu of terraced fields and beach land, dug more than 190,000 water storage ponds, fish scale pits, and dry wells, built more than 3,000 flood control dams, repaired more than 690 gully dams, opened more than 250 irrigation canals, afforested more than 87,000 mu, planted more than 360,000 scattered trees, and sown more than 4,900 mu of barren mountains with tree species. In the mountainous areas of the Yongding River, Daqing River, and other basins of the Hai River water system in Hebei Province, farmers have already built more than 10,000 mu of terraced fields, reinforced more than 410,000 meters of field ridges, and repaired more than 71,000 gully dams. In the mountainous areas of Linyi, Wendeng, and other special districts in Shandong Province, farmers have already controlled more than 10,000 mountain gullies, built more than 2,300 flood control dams and dug water storage ponds, and built 415 small reservoirs. Farmers in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces have also built many terraced fields, field ridges, flood control dams, and waterlogged ponds.

In order to comprehensively carry out water and soil conservation work, the Yellow River Middle Reaches Water and Soil Conservation Comprehensive Survey Team organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other relevant units has completed the general survey of water and soil conservation in 12 counties including Hequ and Pianguan in Shanxi Province along the Yellow River, and proposed appropriate measures. The comprehensive planning of four small rivers with severe soil erosion in the Wuding River, Jing River, and Wei River basins in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, such as Jiuyuangou, has been completed. Six survey teams organized by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the Northwest Yellow River Engineering Bureau, and five other units have conducted site surveys for small reservoirs in the gully areas of the Yellow River tributaries in northern Shaanxi Province. Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have strengthened their water and soil conservation work organizations and trained a large number of cadres and farmer technicians for water and soil conservation work.

    黄河等流域加紧开展水土保持工作
    黄河、海河等流域正在加紧开展冬季水土保持工作。
    山西省黄河沿岸的黄土高原和属于海河水系的桑干河、滹沱河、漳河上游山区的农民，冬季打破惯例，有近百万人投入了水土保持工作。他们已经修梯田、滩地88，000多亩，挖蓄水池、鱼鳞坑、旱井等19万多处，打拦洪坝三千多道，修谷坊690多座，开水渠250多道，造林87，000多亩，零星植树36万株，荒山播种树种4，900多亩。河北省海河水系的永定河、大清河等流域的山区农民已经修梯田一万多亩。培地埂41万多公尺，修谷坊71，000多座。山东省临沂、文登等专区的山区农民已经闸山沟一万多处，打拦洪坝、挖蓄水池等2，300多处，兴建小型水库415座。陕西、甘肃两省农民也修了许多梯田、地埂、拦洪坝、涝池等。
    为了全面开展水土保持工作，中国科学院等有关单位组织的黄河中游水土保持综合考察队，已经完成了黄河沿岸山西省河曲、偏关等12县的水土保持普查工作，并且提出了适宜的措施。陕西、甘肃两省无定河、泾河、渭河流域水土流失严重的韭园沟等四条小河，已经完成了综合规划。黄河水利委员会、西北黄河工程局等七个单位组织的六个查勘队，已经在陕西省北部黄河支流沟壑地区进行了小型水库的库址勘查工作。陕西、甘肃、山西等省和内蒙古自治区都加强了水土保持工作机构，大量培养了水土保持工作的干部和农民技术人员。
