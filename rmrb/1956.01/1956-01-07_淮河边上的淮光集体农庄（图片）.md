Huaiguang Collective Farm on the Banks of the Huai River

The Huaiguang Collective Farm, located on the banks of the Huai River in Fengyang County, Anhui Province, has more than 550 farm households. This farm was established in 1954 and suffered from an unprecedented flood that year, with most of its crops submerged. However, under the leadership of the farm, the farmers actively reclaimed wasteland and rushed to plant late autumn crops, quickly restoring production and overcoming the disaster. In 1955, although the farm was still affected by the previous year's flood, the harvest was very good, with total annual income reaching approximately 380,000 yuan. During this year, they purchased 51 head of draught animals, seven double-wheeled double-furrow plows and other machines, and built more than 200 warehouses and houses. The lives of all the farmers have generally improved. Now, the Huaiguang Collective Farm has made further plans for developing production.

    淮河边上的淮光集体农庄
    安徽省凤阳县境内淮河边上的淮光集体农庄，有550多户庄员。这个农庄是1954年成立的，当年就遭到了百年未有的大水灾，大部庄稼被淹没了。但是庄员在农庄的领导下，积极开荒，抢种晚秋作物，很快就恢复了生产，战胜了灾荒。1955年，这个农庄虽然还受到前一年水灾的影响，但是收成很好，全年的总收入约达38万元。在这一年，他们买了51头耕畜，七部双轮双铧犁和其他机器，并且盖了二百多间仓库和住宅等。全体庄员们的生活普遍得到改善。现在淮光集体农庄又作出了进一步发展生产的规划。
    随着生产的发展，庄员们的生活提高了。这是农庄去年新盖的一部分庄员住宅。　　　　　　　　　　楼并铨摄（新华社稿）
