In 1953, the paddy fields in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, expanded to more than 65,600 mu, accounting for 8.6% of the county's total cultivated land. In 1956, the county's paddy fields will expand to 287,200 mu, accounting for 38% of the total cultivated land. This change is the result of the county's gradual completion of semi-socialist collectivization and the county party committee's continuous efforts to overcome its own conservative thinking as well as that of the vast number of cadres and masses.

In 1954, in order to change the situation where grain and cotton yields were often unstable due to the impact of drought, the county party committee unanimously agreed that it was necessary to continue expanding paddy fields. However, when discussing specific methods for expanding paddy fields, opinions diverged. The majority opinion was: to expand paddy fields, in addition to leveraging the potential of existing wells and waterwheels, the main method was to dig more wells. A minority, however, believed that wells had already reached saturation point, and the main way to expand paddy fields could only be to maximize the potential of existing wells and waterwheels. The two opinions persisted, and in order to resolve this divergence, Dong Dengying, the county party secretary, personally conducted an investigation in the northern part of the county. Judging from the abundant water sources of some old wells there, there was still great potential for developing new wells. The facts convinced those with conservative ideas, the county party committee's opinion was unified, and a well-digging campaign was launched, with more than 300 wells dug throughout the county, expanding paddy fields by more than 12,000 mu.

In the spring of 1955, Jieyu County, as usual, experienced dry and windy weather. The county party committee led the masses to fight the drought with all their strength. Although the masses generally had the desire to expand paddy fields, there was serious conservative thinking, hindering the unfolding of the well-digging campaign. The masses in the bitter water areas believed that the water quality was poor and could not be used for irrigation; the masses in the deep water areas were worried that they would not be able to dig water and would waste their investment. The county party committee helped the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Xujia Village in the bitter water area to test-dig a free-flowing well, diverting the sweet water from the free-flowing well into the bitter water well, turning the bitter water into sweet water, solving the problem of whether wells could be dug in the bitter water area. The county party committee also helped Xiaozhangwu, which had never dug a well before, in the deep water area to test-dig a well, proving that wells could also be dug in the deep water area. The county party committee then organized farmers to visit, using facts to break the worries of the masses in the bitter water area and the deep water area about digging wells, and the well-digging campaign was launched. At this time, the drought in the county was becoming increasingly serious, and the county party committee also discovered that a negative mood of relying on the heavens for food was growing in many people. They believed that digging wells now could not save the crops, greatly affecting the enthusiasm of the masses for digging wells. The county party committee focused on cultivating a "Youth Anti-Drought Well-Digging Shock Brigade" in the Zengjiaying Agricultural Cooperative. This shock brigade dug 12 new wells, dredged 18 old wells, and built 3 water channels in a very short period of time, putting forward the slogan "Men and women work together, waterwheels turn day and night," rushing to draw water, expanding paddy fields by more than 490 mu, and initially overcoming the drought. The county party committee immediately reported this typical experience to the whole county. Soon, more than 300 cooperatives in the county all organized "Youth Anti-Drought Well-Digging Shock Brigades." Under the influence and impetus of the youth shock brigades, the well-digging and drought resistance campaign was fully launched.

As the drought continued to develop, the waterwheels, running day and night, still could not keep up with the land's thirst. The county party committee immediately put forward the slogan of technical reform and leveraging the potential of existing waterwheels. Subsequently, Jing Lewa and others, members of the Liaoyuan Cooperative in Wang Village, increased the water output by two to four times by modifying the liberation-style waterwheels into hand-cranked waterwheels, double-pipe waterwheels, and five-wheel waterwheels. The county party committee seized this typical example and vigorously promoted it, organizing cadres from cooperatives throughout the county to visit and learn. As a result, more than 880 waterwheels were quickly modified throughout the county, rapidly expanding the irrigation area by 10,000 mu, playing a significant role in resisting drought and protecting seedlings.

In this year, a total of 1,258 wells were dug, and the irrigated area in the county was expanded by more than 27,000 mu.

In the winter of 1955, based on the new situation that the county had achieved semi-socialist collectivization, and based on the widespread demand of the masses for greatly increased production and the emergence of a new upsurge in production, the county party committee further overcame conservative thinking and formulated a new task for expanding paddy fields in 1956. In 1956, 500 large brick wells, 6,000 small brick wells, and 300 free-flowing wells will be dug; 50 large reservoirs and small reservoirs will be built; 202 boiler-camel machines and 518 diesel engines will be installed; and the number of new-style waterwheels will also be expanded from the current 6,000 to 8,200. Without a large number of skilled well-digging technicians, it would be impossible to dig 6,800 new wells before spring. When formulating the overall plan for expanding paddy fields, the county party committee foresaw this situation and decided to solve the problem of insufficient technical forces in conjunction with the well-digging campaign. This is to combine well-digging with training technical personnel. The trainees listened to lectures while practicing well-digging. By the end of December, the county had already held three training courses, training more than 920 people. After they returned, they organized well-digging shock brigades and well-digging shock groups, contracting tasks by township and cooperative.

Now, 24 well-digging shock brigades and more than 100 well-digging shock groups have been formed throughout the county, and they guarantee to complete the task of digging 6,800 new wells before spring. In addition, the county party committee also decided to start training 600 technicians to operate power machinery to meet the needs of a large increase in machine irrigation this year.

    在不断克服保守思想中前进
    本报记者　商恺
    1953年山西解虞县的水田扩大到65，600多亩。占全县耕地总面积的8.6％。1956年，全县水田将扩大到287，200亩，占耕地总面积的38％。这种变化，是全县逐步完成半社会主义合作化和县委不断克服本身的以及广大干部和群众的保守思想的成果。
    1954年，县委为了改变粮棉产量因受旱灾的影响经常不能稳定的状况，一致认为必须继续扩大水田。可是在讨论扩大水田的具体办法的时候，意见发生了分歧。多数人的意见是：要扩大水田除了发挥现有水井水车的潜力外，主要是打更多的水井。少数人却认为水井已经发展到饱和程度，扩大水田的主要办法只能是发挥水井水车的潜力。两种意见，坚持不下，为了解决这种分歧，县委书记董登瀛亲自到县境北部作了调查，从那里某些老井水源很旺的情况来看，发展新水井还有很大可能。事实说服了那些具有保守思想的人，县委的意见统一了，打井运动开展起来，全县打井300多眼、扩大水田12，000多亩。
    1955年春季，解虞县照例是干旱的风天。县委领导群众全力进行抗旱斗争。群众虽然普遍有扩大水田的要求，但却存在着严重的保守思想，妨碍着打井运动的展开。苦水地区的群众认为水质不好，不能浇地；深水地区的群众耽心打不出水来，白投资。县委就在苦水地区的许贾村，帮助该村的星火农业合作社试打了一眼自流井，把自流井的甜水引到苦水井中，使苦水变成了甜水，解决了苦水地区能不能打井的问题。县委又在深水地区，帮助从来没有打过水井的小张坞试打了一眼井，证明深水地区同样能够打井。县委就组织农民参观，用事实打破了苦水地区和深水地区群众对打井的顾虑，于是，打井运动展开了。这时，全县旱象日益严重，县委又发现在不少群众中正在滋长着靠天吃饭的消极情绪，他们认为现打井也救不了庄稼，大大影响着群众的打井积极性。县委就在曾家营的增收农业合作社中，重点培养了一个“青年抗旱打井突击队”。这个突击队在很短的时间里，打了12眼新井，掏挖了18眼旧井，修了3条水渠，提出了“男女一齐干，水车日夜转”的口号，突击车水，扩大水田490多亩，初步战胜了旱灾。县委立即把这一典型经验，向全县作了通报。很快，全县300多个合作社，社社都组织了“青年抗旱打井突击队”。在青年突击队的影响和带动下，打井抗旱运动才全面开展起来。
    由于旱象继续发展，水车日夜不停，还赶不上土地的狂喝暴饮。县委立即提出技术改革，发挥现有水车潜力的口号。接着王村燎原合作社社员景乐娃等由于把解放式水车分别改装为手摇水车，双管水车，五轮水车，使出水量增加一倍到四倍。县委抓住这一典型，大张旗鼓地进行了宣传，组织全县合作社的干部参观学习。结果，使全县很快改装了880多辆水车，迅速扩大灌溉面积1万亩，对抗旱保苗起了很大作用。
    这一年，共打水井1，258眼，全县扩大灌溉面积27，000多亩。
    1955年冬天，县委根据全县已经实现了半社会主义合作化的新情况，根据广大群众要求大大增产，生产上将出现新的高潮，进一步克服了保守思想，制定了1956年扩大水田的新任务。1956年要打大型砖井500眼，小型砖井6，000眼，自流井300眼，修筑大型水库和小型蓄水池50座，装锅驼机202部，柴油机518部，新式水车也将由现在的6，000部扩大到8，200部。如果没有一大批熟练的打井技术工人，要在春天以前打成6，800眼新井是不可能的。县委在制定扩大水田的全面规划时，就预见到了这种情况，决定结合打井运动同时解决技术力量不足的问题。这就是把打井和训练技术人员结合起来进行。受训的学员，一边听讲，一边实习打井。到12月底全县已经办了三期训练班，训练了920多人。让他们回去之后，组织打井突击队和打井突击小组，按乡按社分工包干。
    现在，全县已经组成24个打井突击队，100多个打井突击小组，他们保证在春天以前完成6，800眼新井的任务。此外，县委还决定着手训练操作动力机器的技术工人600名，以适应今年大量增加机器灌溉的需要。
