    Cultivating the Talents of Poor Peasant Cadres
    Gao Changren
    By the beginning of January this year, Hunan Province had established more than 114,000 cooperatives, with a large number of activists from poor and lower-middle peasants taking on leadership positions in the cooperatives. A considerable number of these leading cadres are highly enthusiastic about running the cooperatives but have very few methods for doing so. According to a survey of 1,000 poor peasant cadres in 104 cooperatives in the Fulim and Qingtai districts of Changsha County, 30% of them are willing to lead in running the cooperatives but lack working methods. Therefore, how the Party organization cultivates and improves the leadership abilities of these cooperative leading cadres has become a crucial key to further implementing the class line and consolidating the cooperatives.
    The Sanli Township Party Branch in You County has made achievements in this area. The township has 14 newly established cooperatives, and the poor peasant leaders of these new cooperatives are all enthusiastic about running the cooperatives well but lack the ability and confidence to do so. The Party branch has been specifically and patiently helping them. As a result, their working abilities have improved rapidly, and their confidence has greatly increased. Take the poor peasant cadre Li Yuwen as an example. When he mobilized the poor peasant Hou Ganglin to join the cooperative, Hou Ganglin said, "I still owe debts, and I will wait until my ox has worked for two more years and paid off the debts before joining the cooperative." Li Yuwen felt he had nothing more to say. The Party branch helped Li Yuwen analyze that Hou Ganglin's unwillingness to join the cooperative was mainly due to a lack of understanding of the Party's mutual benefit policy. Li Yuwen then publicized the mutual benefit policy to Hou Ganglin, explaining that the cooperative would absolutely not allow households with oxen to suffer losses. Hou Ganglin's concerns were dispelled, and he happily joined the cooperative. When Li Yuwen started to preside over meetings, he was not bold and could not grasp the central issues. The Party branch helped him prepare before the meeting and helped him summarize the experience after the meeting, first letting him convene small-scale poor peasant meetings, and then letting him preside over members' meetings. After several such exercises, he learned how to preside over meetings.
    Conversely, in a cooperative in Tuanshan Township, Pingjiang County, the poor and lower-middle peasants were indeed fully mobilized at the beginning of the establishment of the cooperative, and the leadership advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants was established. However, the branch became complacent and relaxed the cultivation of poor peasant leading cadres. As a result, the director of the preparatory committee and some members of the preparatory committee of this newly established cooperative had fewer working methods and did not have high prestige among the members.
    These two examples show that in the work of establishing and consolidating cooperatives, we must never be satisfied with the proportion of poor and lower-middle peasants in the leading cadres of the cooperatives, but also often pay attention to improving their ability to run the cooperatives. And this kind of talent should not be allowed to grow on its own; the branch must work hard to cultivate it.

    培养贫农骨干的才能
    高长任
    到今年1月初，湖南省已经建立了114，000多个合作社，大批贫农和下中农的积极分子担任了合作社的领导职务。这批领导骨干中有相当一部分人办社的热情很高而办社的办法却很少。据长沙县福临和清太两个区对104个社的1，000个贫农骨干的调查，其中愿意领导办社，但缺乏工作方法的就占30％。因此，党组织如何培养和提高这批合作社领导骨干的领导能力，就成为进一步贯彻执行阶级路线和巩固合作社的重要关键。
    攸县三里乡党支部在这方面的工作是作得有成绩的。这个乡新建立的社有14个，这些新社的贫农领导骨干都有把社办好的热情，却缺乏把社办好的能力和信心。党支部就具体地耐心地对他们进行帮助。这样，他们的工作能力很快提高了，信心也大大增加了。以贫农骨干李郁文为例。当他发动贫农侯刚林入社的时候，侯刚林说：“我还欠着债，等我的耕牛再作两年活，还清了债再入社。”李郁文便感到再无话可说。党支部就帮助李郁文分析了侯刚林不愿入社，主要是不了解党的互利政策。李郁文就向侯刚林宣传了互利政策，说明合作社绝不能让有牛户吃亏。侯刚林的顾虑解除了，高兴地入了社。李郁文开始主持会议的时候，不大胆，也抓不住中心。党支部便在会前帮助他进行准备，会后帮助他总结经验，先让他召开小型的贫农会，然后再让他主持社员大会。经过这样几次锻炼，他就学会了主持会议。
    相反，平江县团山乡有一个合作社，在建社的开头确实充分发动了贫农和下中农，树立了贫农和下中农的领导优势。可是，支部却自满起来，放松了对贫农领导骨干的培养。结果，这个新建社的筹备委员会主任和一部分筹备委员会的委员，工作办法较少，在社员中的威信不高。
    这两个例子说明，在建社和巩固社的工作中，绝不能满足于贫农和下中农在合作社领导骨干中的比例，还要经常注意提高他们的办社才干。而这种才干又不应该让它自行生长，支部必须努力去培养。
