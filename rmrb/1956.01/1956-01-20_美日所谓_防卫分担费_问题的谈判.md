Negotiations on the So-Called "Defense Burden Sharing" Issue Between the U.S. and Japan
Li Gao

Recently, Japan and the United States have been successively holding negotiations on the so-called "defense burden sharing fee." This negotiation is nominally to discuss Japan's request to reduce the 1956 "defense burden sharing fee" (i.e., the occupation troops maintenance fee paid by Japan to the United States as stipulated in the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement"); but in reality, it is a comprehensive review by the U.S. government of Japan's entire military budget for 1956.

According to Kyodo News, at the beginning of this negotiation, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu presented Japan's 1956 military expansion plan to the United States, explained the situation of Japan's various military budgets, and requested the United States to reduce the "defense burden sharing fee" in order for Japan to implement its military expansion plan. During the negotiation, the U.S. representative – Ambassador to Japan Allison – "criticized" Japan's entire military budget and demanded that Japan quickly formulate a long-term military expansion plan. The U.S. government stated that only under this premise could it "agree" to the overall scope of Japan's 1956 military budget, but details would still need to be "negotiated."

As a sovereign country, why should Japan's military budget be discussed with the United States? By what right does the United States have to interfere in Japan's national budget? When discussing this point, the Japanese news agency Kyodo News said: "It is very unpleasant for a country to have another country adopt a critical attitude towards its defense budget." Obviously, this unpleasant thing reflects the relationship between the United States and Japan. Kyodo News believes that "Japan has in fact always been a 'dependent country' of the United States." Japanese people with national self-esteem have long been indignant at this interference by the United States in Japan's budget. Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo said: "This proves that Japan has even lost its sovereignty over managing its finances, and this is something that cannot be ignored!"

The United States' interference in Japan's national budget not only infringes upon Japan's sovereignty, but more seriously, it is taking this opportunity to tie Japan to the wheels of the U.S. war chariot, forcing Japan to embark on the road to war. In the spring of 1955, the United States used this kind of interference, using its so-called "concession" that cost it nothing (i.e., reducing the amount of "defense burden sharing fees" paid by Japan) as a condition to force the Japanese government to actually increase military expenditures by tens of billions of yen in the 1955 national budget. The approach this time is the same. According to the figures already determined in the U.S.-Japan negotiations, the United States has allowed Japan to reduce its "defense burden sharing fee" in 1956 by 8 billion yen compared to 1955; however, military expenditures in Japan's national budget will greatly expand. Among them, the "Defense Agency" funds used for rearmament will increase by more than 13.4 billion yen compared to 1955; the "facility provision fees" used to expand and strengthen U.S. military bases will also increase by more than 2.5 billion yen compared to 1955. In addition, Japan will allocate another 16.3 billion yen outside the budget and use the 20 billion yen in surplus military spending from 1955 to expand its military.

The continued increase in military expenditures in Japan's budget will first of all bring disaster to the lives of the Japanese people and the normal development of the Japanese economy. This disaster has been clearly demonstrated in the past few years. In 1955, Japan's various military expenditures, plus military pensions, totaled as much as 235.9 billion yen, with each Japanese family bearing an average of 15,000 yen in military expenses. In order to raise such huge military expenditures, the Japanese government had no choice but to greatly increase the tax burden on the Japanese people. The budgeted figure for Japan's national taxes in 1955 increased by 330 billion yen compared to 1950, an increase of nearly 80%. The number of taxpayers has expanded tenfold compared to before the war. The expenditures for social insurance, culture, education, health, and other public services in the budget had to be greatly reduced. When the Japanese government campaigned at the beginning of 1955, it "guaranteed" that it would use the surplus funds from the 1954 budget for welfare undertakings, but this money was later diverted to military purposes. At the same time, the fiscal investment and loans stipulated in the budget were mainly invested in monopoly enterprises related to arms production, while the supply of funds to peaceful industries and small and medium-sized enterprises was greatly "tightened." The Japanese government even took a large sum of so-called "special unemployment countermeasure fees" from social insurance funds to recruit young and middle-aged unemployed male workers to build military projects. These practices cannot but further deteriorate the lives of the Japanese people and deepen Japan's economic crisis. The Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare also admitted in its "National Nutrition White Paper" published on December 28, 1955, that Japanese citizens are now generally "lacking" nutrition, that the number of people suffering from various malnutrition-related diseases has "increased," and that it has affected the development of the entire younger generation. The "White Paper" stated that the average height and weight of young men and women in Japan aged fourteen and fifteen are much lower than before the war. At the same time, due to the massive reduction in production and bankruptcies of peaceful industries and small and medium-sized enterprises, unemployment is becoming increasingly serious. The labor situation survey published by the Japanese government at the end of 1955 also admitted that the number of unemployed people crowding into "employment security offices" to find temporary work to make a living has increased by 20% compared to a year ago, while the number of "homeless vagrants" has increased by 40%.

However, under the whip of the United States, the Japanese government now wants to continue to increase the people's military burden and further reduce welfare expenditures. Just as the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was negotiating with the United States to increase Japan's military budget, the Japanese Ministry of Finance correspondingly proposed a draft estimate, intending to further increase tax revenues by more than 50 billion yen in 1956, and to further reduce or completely delete expenditures related to cultural and educational facilities, water conservancy, disaster relief, and housing construction. At the same time, the Japanese government is also investing large amounts of funds in the military industry, planning to greatly expand arms production this year. The Liberal Democratic Party of Japan is also planning to revise the constitution in order to "comprehensively promote" the work of rearmament.

The United States and its followers, fearing stronger resistance from the Japanese people, are spreading a theory that Japan's accelerated rearmament is to enable Japan to obtain "self-defense" capabilities so that the U.S. military can withdraw from Japan as soon as possible. However, just looking at the facts in this U.S.-Japan negotiation is enough to expose the falsehood of this statement. While the United States is forcing Japan to step up its military expansion, it is also unrelaxed in demanding that Japan increase its so-called "facility provision fees" in order to continue to strengthen and expand U.S. military bases in Japan and more firmly control Japan. The remarks made by U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford in Tokyo on January 7 also illustrate this point most clearly. At that time, a Japanese reporter asked Radford: When Japan completes its military strengthening plan in 1960, can the U.S. military completely withdraw from Japan? Radford replied without hesitation: "No, I don't think so. You can't defend yourselves alone yet." This means that U.S. troops will continue to be stationed in Japan after 1960.

For the Japanese people, this "guns before butter" policy of the United States and the Japanese government not only means depriving them of their income and nutrition, but also forcing them to serve as cannon fodder for the United States in launching new wars of aggression in Asia. If Japan does not change its policy of subservience to the United States and does not get rid of the shackles of various enslaving conditions signed with the United States, even if the people tighten their belts to expand their military, it will be impossible to establish a real national armed force, let alone obtain real national independence.

    美日所谓“防卫分担费”问题的谈判
    李高
    最近，日本和美国正在陆续举行所谓“防卫分担费”的谈判。这个谈判，名义上是讨论日本提出的要求削减1956年度的“防卫分担费”（即美日“行政协定”所规定的日本向美国交纳的占领军维持费）的问题；但实际上却是美国政府对日本1956年度的整个军事预算进行全面的审查。
    据共同社说，在这个谈判开始的时候，日本外务相重光葵就向美国提出了日本1956年度的扩军计划，说明了日本各项军事预算的情况，要求美国把“防卫分担费”加以削减，以便日本实施它的扩军计划。谈判中间，美方代表——驻日大使艾利逊——曾对日本的整个军事预算进行“批判”，并要日本迅速订出一个长期扩军计划。美国政府表示，只有在这个前提之下，它对于日本1956年度军事预算的总的范围才能“同意”，但细节方面还要继续“协商”。
    日本作为一个主权国家，它的军事预算为什么要拿去同美国讨论呢？美国凭什么权力要干涉日本的国家预算呢？日本通讯社共同社在谈到这一点时说：“一个国家对别的国家的防卫预算采取批判的态度，在被批判的国家说来是十分不愉快的。”显然，这种不愉快的事情反映了美国对待日本的关系。共同社认为，“日本实际上一直是美国的‘附属国’。”日本的具有民族自尊心的人士，对于美国这种干涉日本预算的行为，早就感到愤慨了。日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎说：“这证明日本连管理财政的主权也丧失了，这是不能忽视的事情！”
    美国干涉日本国家预算的行为，不仅侵犯了日本的主权，更严重的是它正借此把日本缚在美国战车轮子上，迫使日本走上战争的道路。在1955年春天，美国就曾使用这种干涉手段，以它的不花半文本钱的所谓“让步”（即把日本交纳“防卫分担费”数额削减一点）为条件，强迫日本政府在1955年度国家预算中实际上增加了数百亿日元的军事费用。这次的做法也是同样的。据美日谈判中已确定的数字，美国已允许把日本在1956年度负担的“防卫分担费”比1955年度减少80亿日元；但是日本国家预算中的军事费用却要大大膨胀，其中用于重整军备的“防卫厅”经费，将比1955年度再增加134亿多日元；用于为美国扩大和加强军事基地的“设施提供费”，也将比1955年度增加25亿多日元。另外，日本还要在预算外再拨出163亿日元，并把1955年度节余军费200亿日元，一起都用来扩充军备。
    日本预算中军事费用的继续增加，这首先就将给日本人民的生活和日本经济的正常发展带来灾害。这种灾害，在过去几年就已表现得很清楚了。在1955年度，日本的各项军事费用加上军人优抚费，共达2，359亿日元之多，平均每一个日本家庭要负担15，000日元的军费。日本政府为了张罗这样浩大的军费，只好大大加重日本人民的捐税负担。1955年度日本国家租税的预算数字比1950年度增加了3，300亿日元，将近增加80％。纳税人数比战前扩大了十倍。而预算中用于社会保险、文教卫生以及其他公共事业方面的费用，不得不大大削减。日本政府在1955年初竞选的时候，曾“保证”要把1954年度预算中剩余的一笔经费用在福利事业方面，这笔钱后来也被移用到军事方面去了。同时，预算中规定的财政投资和贷款，也主要被投放在与军火生产有关的垄断企业，对和平工业和中小企业的资金供应则被大大“紧缩”。日本政府甚至从社会保险费用中提出很大一笔所谓“特别失业对策费”，用于招雇青壮年失业男工去修建军事工程。这种种做法，不能不促使日本人民的生活更加恶化，并且加深日本的经济危机。日本厚生省在1955年12月28日发表的“国民营养白皮书”中也承认：日本国民现在普遍“缺少”营养，患各种营养不良病症的人数“有所增加”，并且影响了整个年轻一代的发育。“白皮书”说，目前日本十四、五岁青年男女的平均身高和体重，都比战前降低了许多。同时，由于和平工业和中小企业的大量减产和倒闭，失业现象也日益严重。日本政府在1955年年末发表的劳动情况调查也承认，拥到“职业安定所”找临时工作糊口的失业者比一年前增加了20％，而“没有职业的流浪汉”则增加了40％。
    但是，在美国的鞭策之下，现在日本政府还要继续加重人民的军费负担，进一步削减福利费用。正当日本外务省在和美国谈判增大日本的军费预算的时候，日本大藏省已相应地提出概算案，打算在1956年度再增加500多亿日元的租税收入，并把有关文教设施、水利、救灾和住宅建筑等方面的费用进一步削减或者完全删除掉。同时，日本政府还把大量经费投到军事工业方面，预定在今年大大扩充军火生产。日本自由民主党并在策划修改宪法，以便“全面推进”重整军备的工作。
    美国和它的追随者害怕遭到日本人民更加坚强的反抗，正在散布一种论调，说什么日本加速重整军备，是为了使日本获得“自卫”能力后，美国军队早日从日本撤退。但是，只要看看这次美日谈判中的事实，就足以揭穿这种说法的虚妄。美国在逼迫日本加紧扩军的同时，却又毫不放松地要日本增加所谓“设施提供费”，以便继续加强和扩大美国在日本的军事基地，更牢固地控制日本。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福1月7日在东京发表的谈话，也最清楚不过的说明这一点。当时一位日本记者问雷德福：在1960年日本完成了加强军事力量计划时，美军能否全部撤出日本？雷德福毫不掩饰地回答说：“不能，我不这样认为。你们自己还不能单独保卫自己。”这就是说，美国军队在1960年以后还要驻扎在日本。
    对日本人民来说，美国和日本政府的这种“要大炮不要牛油”的政策，不只是意味着剥夺了他们的收入和营养，而且将逼迫他们充当美国在亚洲发动新的侵略战争的炮灰。日本如果不改变它屈从美国的政策，不摆脱和美国签订的各种奴役性条件的束缚，即使人民勒紧裤带扩充军备，也不可能建立真正的民族武装，更不可能获得真正的民族独立。
