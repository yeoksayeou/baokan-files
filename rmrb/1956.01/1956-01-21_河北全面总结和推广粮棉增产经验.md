Hebei Province has recently summarized the advanced experiences of grain and cotton production increase over the past few years. These advanced experiences total more than 380 items. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry is compiling and selecting more than 150 of these experiences that have been effective over the years, preparing to print them into a booklet and distribute them to all agricultural production cooperatives and agricultural technology extension stations throughout the province for promotion.

These advanced experiences include large-area high-yield experiences for cotton, wheat, corn, rice, and sweet potatoes; various advanced technical measures such as soil improvement, selection of improved varieties, improvement of land utilization rate, and prevention and control of large-area pests and diseases; and more than 280 kinds of coarse feed for pig feeding and dozens of fertilizer sources discovered by the masses. In addition, the provincial leading organs have also decided to promote the hand-pushed chicken feather brush powdering machine for large-area control of cotton aphids manufactured by farmers in Wu'an County and the peanut harvester created by farmers in Funing County. The hand-pushed chicken feather brush powdering machine can increase efficiency by 5 times compared to ordinary small powder sprayers, and the insecticidal rate reaches more than 95%.

    河北全面总结和推广粮棉增产经验
    河北省最近总结了几年来粮棉增产的先进经验。这些先进经验共有380多项，省农林厅正在编选其中多年来行之有效的150多项经验，准备印成小册子，发给全省所有农业生产合作社和农业技术推广站推广。
    这些先进经验中，有棉、麦、玉米、水稻、甘薯等大面积丰产经验；有改良土壤、选用良种、提高土地利用率、防治大面积病虫害等多种先进技术措施；还有群众发现的280多种喂猪的粗饲料和好几十种肥源。另外，省领导机关还决定推广武安县农民制造的大面积除治棉蚜的手推式鸡毛刷粉车和抚宁县农民创造的花生收获器。手推式鸡毛刷粉车比一般小型喷粉器能提高效率5倍，杀虫率达到95％以上。（新华社）
