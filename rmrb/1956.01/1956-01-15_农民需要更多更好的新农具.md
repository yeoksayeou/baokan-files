Farmers Need More and Better New Farm Tools

To the Editor:

    In order to understand farmers' demands and opinions on new farm tools, the Huachuan County of Heilongjiang Province recently conducted a survey of 32 agricultural production cooperatives. The farmers unanimously requested that the industrial production departments supply them with more and better new farm tools.

    Some new farm tools are very popular with farmers after they are manufactured; unfortunately, the quantity is small and cannot meet the needs of farmers. For example, small threshers are not only cheap and efficient, but also reduce the loss of wheat during the threshing process. In addition, the use of small corn threshers can increase work efficiency by more than double compared to manual threshing. After the promotion of high-yield and stable-yield crops, the corn planting area continues to expand, and the harvest volume increases year by year, so the demand for this machine has greatly increased. However, both of these machines are currently difficult to buy in Huachuan County.

    Due to the continuous development of the sugar industry, sugar beets have become one of the main crops in many areas of Huachuan County. In 1955, the five agricultural production cooperatives of Minsheng, Jinsheng, Hongsheng, Dongxing, and Fuxing planted 80 hectares of sugar beets, with a harvest of more than three million catties. However, harvesting sugar beets is very labor-intensive. Therefore, farmers call harvesting sugar beets harvesting "worry lumps" and request industrial departments to manufacture sugar beet harvesters. Due to the promotion of close-planting crops, farmers need a large number of flat-planting 45 cm ridge soybean double-shaft small cultivators. Due to the use of chaff cutters, threshers and other machinery, farmers also need a large number of diesel engines. These are all new demands from farmers.

    In addition, farmers also have some opinions on the quality and specifications of some new farm tools that are now widely used: for example, the rocker-arm harvesters produced by Lingshan and Beijing agricultural machinery factories have weak welds at the connection of the cutter bar, and the wooden climbing poles are not strong, and they are easy to break; and there is only one harvesting knife, and it is hoped that a spare one will be added. The ten-row seeder produced by Jiamusi Machinery Factory often breaks the rows and is uneven when sowing soybeans; the drive shaft is too soft and easily bends; the square wheel shaft rises and falls inaccurately during lifting and lowering, and is easy to break; the seed-piercing device frame is not strong and easily breaks; the wheels are loose, which hinders the sowing speed. The weeding knife installed on the comprehensive shovel cultivator is riveted and cannot be replaced by itself. It is best to change it to a screw-tightened one; the plowshare installed on the machine is of poor quality and easily breaks, so everyone calls it a "Sunday plowshare." The disc harrow produced by Liaoning Farm Tool Factory easily wears out the disc blades; the set screw nest of the vertical shaft is too shallow and easily fails. The roller of the compactor is too heavy (more than 600 catties), and it is best to change it to 300 to 500 catties. It is hoped that the relevant farm tool production departments will pay attention to these opinions and demands of farmers, prioritize them, and gradually trial-produce various new products needed by farmers, and strive to increase the output of existing products, improve specifications and improve quality.

### 农民需要更多更好的新农具

    农民需要更多更好的新农具编辑同志：
    黑龙江省桦川县为了了解农民对新农具的要求和意见，最近向32个农业生产合作社进行了一次调查。农民们的一致要求是：希望工业生产部门供应他们更多更好的新农具。
    有一些新农具制造出来以后，很受农民的欢迎；可惜数量很少，不能满足农民的要求。像小型脱谷机不但价格便宜、工作效率高，并且可以减少小麦在脱粒过程中的损耗。又像使用小型玉米脱粒机要比人工脱粒提高工作效率一倍多；在推广高产稳产作物以后，玉米播种面积不断扩大，收获量逐年增加，这种机器需要量就大大增加了。但是，这两种机器目前在桦川县都很难买到。
    由于制糖工业不断发展，甜菜已成为桦川县不少地区的主要农作物之一。民生、金胜、洪胜、东兴、复兴等五个农业生产合作社1955年种了甜菜80垧，收获量达三百多万斤。但是收甜菜很费劳动力。因此，农民称收甜菜为收“愁疙疸”，要求工业部门制造甜菜收割机。由于推广了密播作物，农民就需要大批的平播45公分垅大豆双辕小趟犁。由于使用了铡草机、脱谷机等机械，农民还需要大批柴油机。这些都是农民们新的要求。
    此外，农民们对于现在已经广泛使用的一部分新式农具的质量和规格也有一些意见：如灵山和北京两个农业机械厂出产的摇臂式收割机，刀杆连接处焊得不坚固，木爬杆也不结实，都容易折断；而收割刀也只有一把，希望增加一把备用的。佳木斯机械厂出产的十行播种机，播大豆的时候经常断条，不均匀；主动轮轴太软，容易弯；升降的时候方轮轴起落不准，容易断；穿种装置架不坚固、容易坏；轱辘松，妨碍播种速度。综合号铲趟机上面安装的锄草刀是铆的，不能自行调换，最好改为螺丝拧的；机上安装的铧，质量太坏，容易断，大家叫它“礼拜铧”。辽宁农具厂出产的圆盘耙，拉板容易把圆盘片磨坏；立轴顶丝的窝太浅、容易失效。镇压器的镇压辕过重（六百斤以上），最好改轻为三百到五百斤。希望有关的农具生产部门重视农民的这些意见和要求，分别轻重缓急，逐步试制农民需要的各种新产品，并努力提高现有各种产品的产量，改进规格和提高质量。
