Xinhua News Agency, January 28th -- The National Provincial, Municipal, and Autonomous Region Industrial Bureau (Department) Heads Conference, recently held in Beijing, decided that local industries will greatly increase production of agricultural machinery and industrial goods needed in rural areas this year. Based on the new situation of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization across the country, which is causing a high tide of agricultural production, this conference decided to produce 5 million double-wheel double-furrow plows and double-wheel single-furrow plows this year. This figure is nearly ten times higher than the actual output last year. The planned production of waterwheels, water pumps, boiler-turbine units, insecticide sprayers, etc., this year is also several to ten times higher than last year's output. The conference requested factories producing these machines to increase production shifts as much as possible and strive to produce more products in the first quarter. The conference also determined that the total output value of local industries, including textile, paper, sugar, brewing, food, rubber, and pharmaceutical factories, should increase by more than 20% compared to last year.
    The conference also requested relevant units in all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions to vigorously organize local factories to produce products needed by rural areas.

    地方工业将大量增产农村所需工业品
    据新华社28日讯　最近在北京举行的全国省、市、自治区工业厅（局）长会议上，决定地方工业今年大量增产农业机械和农村需要的工业品。这次会议根据全国农业合作化的高潮正在引起全国农业生产高潮的新形势，决定在今年内生产500万部双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁。这个数字比去年实际产量增加了近十倍。今年计划生产的水车、抽水机和锅驼机、杀虫用的喷雾器等，也比去年的产量高几倍到十倍以上。会议要求生产这些机械的工厂，尽量增加生产班次，争取第一季内多生产一些产品。会议还确定今年地方工业中的纺织、造纸、制糖、酿酒、食品、橡胶、医药等工厂的生产总值比去年提高20％以上。
    会议还要求各省、市、自治区的有关单位，大力组织当地其他工厂生产农村需要的产品。
