How to Guarantee Female Staff in Government Offices Have Time to Manage Household Chores

After the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily published the letter "Give Us Time to Rest and Manage Household Chores" on January 8th, we have also received letters from some female staff in government offices. They believe that the lack of reasonable guarantees for the spare time of government office staff is not an isolated phenomenon at present. In their letters, they analyzed the causes of this phenomenon and proposed some solutions.

According to the working hours stipulated by the State Council, government office staff should have a lot of spare time. However, why is there a problem of insufficient rest time and time to manage household chores? The reasons given in the letters mainly include the following:

First, some offices have too many meetings; some meetings last for several hours, or even until midnight, due to insufficient preparation or even no preparation at all.

Second, some offices concentrate the organizational work of some extracurricular activities on a few people, so these few people are overburdened and are in a state of chaos all day long.

Third, some female staff members are not good at using their time reasonably: for example, some female comrades are distracted during working hours, unable to concentrate, so their work efficiency is not high, and the work cannot be completed on schedule, so they have to squeeze in time outside of work to do it. Also, some female comrades do not know how to manage household chores and children, so they get half the results with twice the effort and always feel that there is not enough time.

How to solve this problem? The female staff members who wrote the letters proposed the following solutions:

First, all government offices should conscientiously implement the working hours stipulated by the State Council. It is of course not absolutely avoidable to have crash tasks that require working overtime, but it should never become a regular means of completing work tasks. Moreover, after staff members work overtime, the leadership should appropriately compensate them with time to manage household chores, depending on the specific circumstances.

Second, administrative leaders of government offices and Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations should comprehensively plan extracurricular collective activities and make reasonable and specific arrangements for meetings and other collective activities. More importantly, all meetings must be prepared in advance to save time.

Third, do not pile social activities on a few people, so as to avoid overburdening certain staff members. Paying attention to this problem can not only solve the difficulty of certain staff members having too many concurrent jobs, but also enable more activists to play their roles.

Fourth, female staff members should learn to use their time reasonably. In their work, they should learn scientific work methods and continuously improve their work efficiency. They should also arrange their spare time reasonably, and also learn better and faster ways to handle housework.

Here, one situation should also be pointed out. Some female staff members are too immersed in household chores and children's issues, so that they regard necessary extracurricular studies and meetings as "extra burdens," and even cannot do their jobs properly. This bias should also be corrected.

Finally, the female staff members who wrote the letters believe that handling housework is the business of every member of the family. The family should make appropriate divisions of labor based on the principle of mutual help and mutual care. Now many male comrades have helped their wives with household chores, and pay attention to educating their children with the practical actions of parents loving labor. This is commendable and should be promoted. Propaganda and Education Department of the All-China Women's Federation

### 怎样保证机关女工作人员有料理家务的时间

    怎样保证机关女工作人员有料理家务的时间
    1月8日人民日报“读者来信专页”发表了“给我们休息时间和料理家务的时间”的来信以后，我们也陆续收到一些机关女工作人员的来信。她们认为，机关工作人员的业余时间得不到合理保证，这在目前并不是个别的现象。她们在来信中分析了造成这种现象的原因，并且提出了一些解决办法。
    机关工作人员的业余时间，根据国务院颁布的作息时间的规定来看，应该是很多的。但是，为什么又会有休息时间和料理家务的时间不够的问题呢？来信中提出的原因主要有下面几个：
    首先，某些机关会议太多；有些会议由于准备不够充分甚至根本没有准备而一开就是几个钟头，甚至拖到半夜。
    其次，有些机关把一些业余活动的组织工作，集中在少数人身上，因此这少数人的负担过重，整日忙乱不堪。
    再次，有些女工作人员不善于合理使用时间：例如，有的女同志在工作时间心挂两头，不能全神贯注，因此工作效率不高，工作不能按期完成，只好挤在业余时间来做。又如，有的女同志不会料理家务和孩子，因此事倍功半，总觉得时间不够。
    怎样解决这个问题呢？来信的女工作人员提出了以下的办法：
    第一，各机关应该认真执行国务院规定的作息时间。有突击任务需要加班加点，这在目前当然还不能绝对避免，但是也决不应该成为完成工作任务的经常手段。而且，在工作人员加班加点以后，领导上应该根据具体情况适当补予料理家务的时间。
    第二，机关行政领导和党、团、工会组织应该全面规划业余集体活动，对会议和其他集体活动作出合理而具体的安排。更重要的是，一切会议事前都要作好准备工作，以节省时间。
    第三，不要把社会活动堆在少数人身上，以免某些工作人员负担过多。注意了这个问题，不仅可以解决某些工作人员兼职过多的困难，而且还能使更多的积极分子发挥他们的作用。
    第四，女工作人员要学会合理使用时间。在工作中要学习科学的工作方法，不断地提高工作效率。对业余时间也应该合理安排，同时还要学会更好、更快地处理家务的办法。
    这里，也应该指出一种情况。有些女工作人员过于沉溺在家务和孩子问题上，以致把必要的业余学习和会议也当成“额外负担”，甚至连工作也不能好好做。这种偏向也是应该纠正的。
    最后，来信的女工作人员们认为，处理家务是家庭每个成员的事情。一家应该在互相帮助，互相照顾的原则下，作适当的分工。现在有不少男同志已经帮助妻子处理家务，并且注意用父母热爱劳动的实际行动来教育子女。这是值得赞扬的，应该加以提倡。　全国妇联宣教部
