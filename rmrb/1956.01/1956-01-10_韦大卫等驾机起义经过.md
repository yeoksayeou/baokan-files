Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 9th - Our reporter interviewed Wei Dawei, Liang Feng, and Zhai Xiaowu, who returned on the 7th from Taiwan after piloting an aircraft in an uprising. They described the process of flying back to the motherland.

　　On the morning of the 7th, Taipei's Songshan Airport was shrouded in white fog. Wei Dawei and the other two decided to take advantage of this favorable weather to begin their action. Wei Dawei first cleverly deceived the sentry and, together with Liang Feng and Zhai Xiaowu, boarded Chiang Wei-kuo's special tourist plane, managed by the Taipei Flying Club, and quickly took off. This was at 6:45 in the morning. When they flew away from Taiwan Island, they saw the sky full of clouds, and they felt much relieved. Wei Dawei said to Liang Feng and Zhai Xiaowu: "There's nothing above us, so we don't have to worry about being chased; we need to pay attention to what's below!" As expected, they discovered three American warships on the sea surface. Wei Dawei then piloted the plane into the clouds. When the mainland of the motherland appeared before their eyes, Wei Dawei excitedly said, "We've reached our destination! This is the motherland!"

　　They landed safely in a certain place in Fujian. Everything was intact. When they walked out of the cabin with nervous and excited feelings, a large group of people ran from nearby villages and fields, cheering and embracing them, warmly welcoming them.

　　Wei Dawei and the other two are young men aged 23 to 26. They were all deceived by Chiang's bandit army to go to Taiwan in 1949 to serve as soldiers. Over the years, they suffered humiliation in Chiang's bandit army and saw enough of Chiang's bandit's treasonous crimes and the facts of American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan. Wei Dawei had been imprisoned for a hundred days for expressing dissatisfaction with the corrupt behavior of Chiang's bandit army officers, and he had also been punished for not saluting American officers. In November 1955, Wei Dawei was finally expelled from Chiang's bandit army. He went to the Taipei Flying Club of Chiang's bandit Taiwan Civil Aviation Administration as a pilot. At this time, Liang Feng and Zhai Xiaowu also retired from the army due to illness. Wei Dawei introduced these two friends to the Taipei Flying Club as staff members and agreed to fly back to the mainland of the motherland together. They often secretly talked about their friends Liu Ruolong, Song Baorong, and others who had already risen up and flown back to the mainland of the motherland, and the news of the great construction being carried out in the motherland, which strengthened their will to fly back to the mainland of the motherland.

　　Wei Dawei, Zhai Xiaowu, and Liang Feng finally said to the reporter, we hope that our friends who are still in Taiwan can also find opportunities to abandon the darkness and turn to the light as soon as possible and return to the embrace of the great motherland.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 9th - Wei Dawei, a pilot, and Liang Feng and Zhai Xiaowu, staff members of the Taipei Flying Club of Chiang's bandit Taiwan Civil Aviation Administration (yesterday mistakenly written as "Taipei Travel Agency"), who returned after piloting an aircraft in an uprising, received a warm welcome in Fujian. On the afternoon of the same day that Wei Dawei and others landed in a certain place in Fujian, a welcome meeting of more than 1,000 people was held locally. On the 8th, the leading organs of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the Fuzhou area also held a welcome meeting.

　　韦大卫等驾机起义经过
  　新华社福州9日电　本社记者访问了在7日从台湾驾飞机起义归来的韦大卫、梁枫和翟笑梧。他们叙述了这次飞回祖国大陆的经过。
    7日早晨，台北松山机场笼罩在一片白雾中。韦大卫等三人决心趁这个有利的天气开始行动。韦大卫首先机智地骗过哨兵，同梁枫、翟笑梧登上了由台北飞行社代管的蒋纬国旅行游览专机，赶快起飞。这时是早晨6点45分。当他们飞离台湾岛的时候，只见满天是云，他们心里就松快多了。韦大卫向梁枫和翟笑梧说：“上面没有什么了，追也不怕了；要注意下面！”他们果然发现在海面上有三艘美国兵舰。韦大卫便驾着飞机钻进云层里。当他们眼前出现了祖国大陆的时候，韦大卫兴奋地说：“到目的地了！这就是祖国！”
    他们安全地在福建某地着陆了。一切都完好无损。当他们怀着紧张、激奋的心情走出机舱时，从附近的村庄和田野里跑来了一大群人，欢呼着和他们拥抱、握手，热烈欢迎他们。
    韦大卫三人是23岁到26岁的青年。他们都是在1949年被蒋贼军骗到台湾去当兵的。几年来，他们在蒋贼军中受尽了凌辱，看够了蒋贼的卖国罪行和美帝国主义侵略台湾的事实。韦大卫曾经因为对蒋贼军官的贪污行为表示不满而坐了一百天牢，也曾因为没有向美国军官敬礼而受到处罚。1955年11月，韦大卫终于被蒋贼军开除军籍。他到蒋贼台湾民用航空局台北飞行社当飞行员。这时，梁枫和翟笑梧也先后因病退伍。韦大卫便把他这两个朋友介绍到台北飞行社做职员，并商定一同驾机起义飞回祖国大陆。他们常常偷偷地谈论着已经起义飞回祖国大陆的朋友刘若龙、宋宝荣等人，和祖国正在进行的伟大的建设的消息，这些都加强了他们飞回祖国大陆的意志。
    韦大卫、翟笑梧和梁枫最后向记者说，我们希望现在还在台湾的朋友们也能早日寻找机会，弃暗投明，回到伟大祖国的怀抱里来。
    据新华社福州9日电　驾驶飞机起义归来的蒋贼台湾民用航空局台北飞行社（昨误为“台北旅行社”）飞行员韦大卫和职员梁枫、翟笑梧，在福建受到热烈的欢迎。韦大卫等人驾机在福建某地降落的当天下午，当地举行了一千多人的欢迎大会。8日，驻福州地区的解放军部队领导机关也举行了欢迎会。
