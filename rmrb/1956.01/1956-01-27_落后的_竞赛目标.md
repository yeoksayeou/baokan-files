The Heavy Industry Ministry's Black Metallurgy Design Institute's design for the Anshan Iron and Steel (Angang) second ring water system's No. 15 water station's concrete engineering, totaling 49 drawings, had 360 revisions after construction began. This delayed the pipeline project by two months, wasting 10,000 man-days. Their design for Angang's refractory material plant's vertical kiln project drawings had 680 revisions, with one drawing alone having 75 revisions. There are many similar situations. However, in the competition within this design institute, some design sections even proposed a "striving for an average of no more than four errors per drawing" competition goal, and even the most advanced sections only proposed "striving for an average of no more than half an error."

To ensure the "more, faster, better, and more economical" completion of the country's construction plans, a prerequisite is to guarantee the timely delivery of high-quality drawings. To encourage people to achieve this, the first step is to put forward the battle cry of "resolutely eliminating errors." To have a highest competition goal of four errors or half an error per drawing is tantamount to calling on people to lose the battle before going to war! We do not need such competition.

    落后的“竞赛目标”
    重工业部黑色冶金设计院设计的鞍钢第二环水系统15水站的部分混凝土工程，一共49张图纸，开工以后修改了360处，管道工程为此拖延两个月，单人工就浪费10，000个。他们设计的鞍钢耐火材料厂竖窑工程的图纸，修改了680处，其中有一张图纸竟修改了75处。类似这样的情况还有很多。但是，这个设计院在竞赛中，有的设计科竟提出“争取每张图纸平均不超过四个错”的竞赛目标，最先进的科也只提出“争取平均不超过半个错”。
    要保证“又多、又快、又好、又省”地完成国家的建设计划，先决条件是保证按时交出质量良好的图纸。而要鼓舞人们做到这一点，首先就要提出“坚决消灭错误”的战斗口号。最高争取目标是一张图纸上有四个错或半个错，这无异在作战之前号召人们去打败仗！这样的竞赛我们是不需要的。
