Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia recently submitted its fourth interim report. The report describes the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Cambodia from April 1, 1955, to September 30, 1955, and the work of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia.

    The report first mentions the issue of reprisals against former Khmer Resistance fighters. The report points out that incidents of former Khmer Resistance fighters being arrested when they went to the Cambodian Royal authorities to obtain identification cards used to occur frequently. Such incidents have decreased recently. However, many former Khmer Resistance fighters are still being detained or persecuted in various ways. The International Commission has brought this to the attention of the Cambodian Royal Government, but "some have not been answered, and some of the answers received are not entirely satisfactory." The International Commission hopes that "those outstanding cases will be dealt with promptly" and that "there will be no more reprisals against former Khmer Resistance fighters."

    The report mentions the elections held in Cambodia on September 11, 1955. The Geneva Accords stipulate that this election should be held by secret ballot with respect for fundamental freedoms, and that all Cambodian citizens should be able to participate as electors and candidates. The International Commission observed this election in order to understand whether it was conducted in accordance with the above provisions of the Geneva Accords, paying particular attention to whether discrimination against former Khmer Resistance fighters occurred. The Cambodian Royal Government had initially refused to allow the People's Party, organized by former Khmer Resistance fighters, to participate in the election. This issue was finally resolved after the International Commission raised it with the Cambodian Royal Government. During the election campaign, the International Commission found that some candidates and campaign workers from the People's Party and other opposition parties were arrested. It also received some allegations that the campaign activities of the People's Party and the Democratic Party were obstructed and disrupted. The International Commission believes that, as it only observed the election and did not supervise it, it did not investigate those allegations. Therefore, it "has no right to make any general conclusions about the entire election." The International Commission believes that, in general, the provisions of the Cambodian Royal Constitution regarding secret ballots, etc., were observed; and, in its view, the political settlement of Cambodia as stipulated by the Geneva Accords can be said to have been achieved.

    Regarding the US-Cambodia Military Assistance Agreement signed on May 16, 1955, the International Commission had previously submitted its third interim report specifically on this issue, pointing out that many clauses of this agreement violated the Geneva Accords. The Royal Government had guaranteed that those clauses of the US-Cambodia agreement that violated the Geneva Accords would not be implemented, and that its acceptance of foreign military aid would be strictly supervised by the International Commission. In its fourth interim report, the International Commission mentions that the US military aid advisory group stationed in Cambodia under the US-Cambodia agreement has arrived in Cambodia. The report believes that one of the main tasks of the International Commission in the future is to supervise the implementation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords concerning military aid, military bases, and military alliances, and that in this supervisory work, "the Royal Government's guarantee regarding the implementation of the US-Cambodia agreement must always be kept in mind."

### 柬埔寨国际委员会第四次工作报告

    柬埔寨国际委员会第四次工作报告
    新华社24日讯　柬埔寨国际委员会最近提出了第四次工作报告。报告叙述了1955年4月1日到9月30日在柬埔寨实施日内瓦协议的情况和柬埔寨国际委员会的工作。
    报告首先提到前高棉抗战人员遭受报复的问题。报告指出，过去曾经时常发生前高棉抗战人员前往柬埔寨王国当局处领取身份证时被逮捕的事件。最近这一类事件已经减少。但是，不少前高棉抗战人员还是在各种方式下被拘押或者遭受迫害。国际委员会曾就此提起柬埔寨王国政府的注意，可是，“有的并没有得到答复，已经得到的一些答复也并不完全满意。”国际委员会希望“那些悬而未决的案件将被迅速地处理”，并且“将不再对前高棉抗战人员进行报复”。
    报告提到1955年9月11日在柬埔寨举行的选举。日内瓦协议规定，这一选举应该在尊重基本自由的条件下以秘密投票方式举行，全体柬埔寨公民都应该能够以选举人和候选人的资格参加。国际委员会观察了这一选举，以便了解这一选举是否按照日内瓦协议的上述规定进行，特别注意是否有歧视前高棉抗战人员的事情发生。柬埔寨王国政府曾经一度拒绝前高棉抗战人员所组织的人民派参加竞选。在国际委员会向柬埔寨王国政府提出以后，这个问题终于获得解决。在竞选期间，国际委员会发现，有一些人民派和其他反对党的候选人和选举宣传员被逮捕，同时，它也收到了关于人民派和民主党的竞选活动遭到阻挠和破坏的一些指控。国际委员会认为，由于它只是观察而没有监督这一选举，对那些指控并没有进行调查，因此，它“无权对整个选举作出任何总的结论”。国际委员会认为，总地说来，柬埔寨王国宪法中关于秘密投票等规定得到了遵守；而且，在它看来，日内瓦协议所规定的柬埔寨的政治解决，可以说已经实现。
    关于1955年5月16日所签订的美柬军事援助协定，国际委员会过去曾经专门为这个问题提出过第三次工作报告，指出这个协定的许多条款是违反日内瓦协议的。王国政府曾经保证，美柬协定中那些违反日内瓦协议的条款将不被实施，而它在接受外国军事援助时将由国际委员会进行严格的监督。国际委员会在这一次所提出的第四次工作报告中提到，美国根据美柬协定而派驻柬埔寨的军事援助顾问团，已经来到柬埔寨。报告认为，国际委员会今后的主要工作之一，就是监督日内瓦协议中有关军事援助、军事基地、军事同盟等方面的规定的实施，而在这一监督工作中，“必须时刻记住王国政府关于美柬协定的实施问题所作出的保证”。
