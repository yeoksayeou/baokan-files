Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 12th: The "Indian Express" said on January 12th that observers in the Indian capital considered Dulles' visit to India "unnecessary." They said that it would be overly optimistic to expect India, a country that openly and firmly opposes the Manila Treaty Organization, to specifically invite the organization's founder.

The "Indian Express" said that Dulles is not very popular in India, and the joint communique he issued with the Portuguese Foreign Minister on the Goa issue has made him even less popular. These observers believe that Dulles would do well to return home directly from Karachi and not insist on visiting New Delhi, which would embarrass the Indian government.

    印度舆论不欢迎杜勒斯访印
    新华社新德里12日电  “印度快报”1月12日说，印度首都的观察家们认为杜勒斯访问印度“是不必要的”。他们说，指望公开坚决反对马尼拉条约组织的国家印度会特地邀请这个组织的缔造者未免希望过奢。
    “印度快报”说，杜勒斯在印度并不是很得人心的，而他同葡萄牙外交部长就果阿问题发表的联合公报使他更不得人心了。这些观察家认为，杜勒斯最好从喀喇蚩直接回国而不要坚持访问新德里而使印度政府感到为难。
