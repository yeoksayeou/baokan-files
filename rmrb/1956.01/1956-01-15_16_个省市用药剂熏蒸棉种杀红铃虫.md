Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: Sixteen cotton-producing provinces and cities across the country are using methyl bromide fumigation to kill cotton bollworms in cotton seeds. All cotton seeds used in the joint prevention zone for cotton bollworms in Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces will be fumigated. All cotton seeds used in the three new bollworm-free demonstration counties of Jieyu, Linfen, and Fenyang in Shanxi Province this year will also be fumigated. The improved cotton seeds to be transferred from Jiangsu Province to Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and other provinces this year will also be fully fumigated. It is estimated that more than 2 million dan of cotton seeds will be fumigated nationwide, which can be used to plant more than 20 million mu.
The fumigation and pest control effect of cotton seeds transferred to Hubei, Anhui, and other provinces in 1955 was 100%. The fumigation cost per mu of seeds is only 5 fen. In areas where fumigated seeds are sown, field spraying is also commonly carried out during the cotton growing season to prevent and control pests. As a result, the average boll damage rate has been reduced from 62% in 1953 to 15% in 1955.

    16个省市用药剂熏蒸棉种杀红铃虫
    新华社14日讯  全国有16个产棉省、市正在用溴化甲烷药剂熏蒸棉花种子，杀灭红铃虫。湖北、安徽、江西3省红铃虫联防区所用的棉花种子都将熏蒸。山西省新定的解虞、临汾、汾阳3个无红铃虫示范县今年所用的棉花种子也将全部熏蒸。今年准备从江苏省调往山东、河北、河南、山西等省的棉花良种，也将全部熏蒸。全国估计共要熏蒸棉花种子200多万担，可以用来播种2，000多万亩。
    1955年调往湖北、安徽等省的棉花种子，熏蒸杀虫的效果是100％。每亩种子的熏蒸费只需5分。播种熏蒸过种子的地区，在棉花生长期间又普遍进行田间喷药，防治虫害。因此，棉铃的平均被害率已经从1953年的62％降低到1955年的15％。
