Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: Melbourne Dispatch: The military advisors of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) held a secret meeting in Melbourne, Australia, on the 17th. The meeting is scheduled to last for five days.

According to a United Press report on the 16th, the "purpose of this meeting is to give teeth to the Manila Treaty." The meeting will discuss the report submitted by the military staff planning personnel of the Manila Treaty Organization at a meeting held in Honolulu last November. At that meeting, the military staff planning personnel discussed the secret military plan approved by the military advisors of the Manila Treaty Organization at their first meeting last July. This plan stipulates the establishment of the Manila Treaty Organization's military forces to serve the American policy of aggression and enslavement of Asia.

The United Press report also revealed that the meeting will also plan "internal" "defense work," that is, to suppress the forces in Southeast Asian countries striving for independence, democracy, and freedom.
