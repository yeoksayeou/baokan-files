Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: German Democratic Republic Ambassador to China, Kippner, held a reception on the evening of January 3rd to celebrate the 80th birthday of the President of the German Democratic Republic, Wilhelm Pieck.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Hanfu, Ji Pengfei, as well as responsible persons from various departments of state organs and people's organizations, and people from all walks of life in the capital, more than 50 people in total, were invited to attend the reception.

Also present at the reception were diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries stationed in China.

At the reception, Ambassador Kippner spoke first. He said: For the people of the German Democratic Republic, and even, we can say, for all peace-loving German people, our President's 80th birthday is a great happy event. Our President is universally admired throughout Germany. Due to his international activities, our President's name has a good reputation throughout the world. Today, many envoys from governments of the countries of the peace camp and people's parliaments and representatives of the workers' movement from all over the world are in Berlin to celebrate his birthday.

Kippner said: From his youth, Wilhelm Pieck was a fighter against Prussian militarism and against the German monopoly capital that plunged mankind into two world wars. In his 60 years of political activity, President Pieck has developed from an ordinary party member and cadre of the workers' party to a leader of the German working class and the German people. President Pieck is realizing the legacy of the greatest Germans, Marx and Engels; he is a loyal student of Lenin and Stalin. He has always been, and still is, a true truster of the people.

Kippner said: President Pieck is a great friend of the Soviet Union, which liberated our German people from fascism. President Pieck is a great friend of the People's China; not long ago, he granted the delegation of the government of the German Democratic Republic full powers to conclude a "Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation" with the People's Republic of China. President Pieck is a true internationalist, a tireless fighter for lasting peace and friendly cooperation among nations.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi then spoke. He, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people, extended warm and fraternal congratulations to Ambassador Kippner, and to the Government of the German Democratic Republic, the Central Committee the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and the German people.

Liu Shaoqi said: The Chinese people know that Comrade Wilhelm Pieck is a loyal son of the German working class and the German people, an outstanding activist in the international workers' movement, and the organizer and leader of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. From his youth to the advanced age of 80, Comrade Wilhelm Pieck has dedicated all his energy to the cause of liberation of the working class and the working people. He has made brilliant contributions to the international workers' movement and the cause of establishing the German working-class party, to the struggle against wars of aggression, to the maintenance of world peace, and to the struggle for the peaceful reunification of Germany. Therefore, Comrade Wilhelm Pieck is not only sincerely loved by the German working class and the German people, but also revered by the Chinese working class, the Chinese people, and the world's working class and all peace-loving people.

Liu Shaoqi said: The increasing development and consolidation of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Germany are inseparable from the direct concern of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck. The friendly visit of the delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, and the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation concluded with the People's Republic of China, have made significant contributions to the further development of Sino-German friendly relations and cooperation. We are particularly pleased that this time coincides with the 80th birthday of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck.

At the reception, Polish Ambassador Kirylok, Indian Ambassador R.K. Nehru and Soviet Ambassador Yudin successively rose to speak, warmly congratulating President Pieck on his 80th birthday.

During the banquet, the hosts and guests repeatedly raised their glasses to wish President Pieck a long life.

　　民主德国大使纪普纳举行招待会
    新华社3日讯　德意志民主共和国驻中国大使纪普纳3日晚举行招待会，庆祝德意志民主共和国威廉·皮克总统80寿辰。
    刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理和沈钧儒、郭沫若、彭真、张治中、傅作义、章伯钧、章汉夫、姬鹏飞以及国家机关各部门、各人民团体的负责人和首都各界人士等50多人应邀出席了招待会。
    出席招待会的，还有各国驻华使节和外交官员。
    招待会上，纪普纳大使首先讲话。他说：对德意志民主共和国人民，甚至可以说，对全体爱好和平的德国人民来说，我们总统的80寿辰是一件大喜事。我们的总统在全德国受到普遍的敬仰。由于他的国际活动，我们总统的名字在全世界有着良好的声誉。今天，和平阵营各国政府和人民议会的许多使者和世界各国工人运动的代表在柏林向他表示庆祝。
    纪普纳说：威廉·皮克从青年时代起就是反对普鲁士军国主义和反对曾把人类推入两次世界大战的德国垄断资本的战士。皮克总统在60年政治活动中从工人政党的普通党员和干部发展成为德国工人阶级和德国人民的领袖。皮克总统正在实现最伟大的德国人——马克思和恩格斯的遗训；他是列宁和斯大林的忠实学生。他过去和现在都是人民真正的信任者。
    纪普纳说：皮克总统是把我们德国人民从法西斯主义下解放出来的苏联的伟大朋友。皮克总统是人民中国的伟大朋友；不久前他曾授予德意志民主共和国政府代表团以全权，同中华人民共和国缔结一项“友好合作条约”。皮克总统是一个真正的国际主义者，争取持久和平和各国友好合作的不懈的战士。
    刘少奇委员长接着讲话。他代表中华人民共和国政府、中国共产党中央委员会和中国人民向纪普纳大使，并且向德意志民主共和国政府、德国统一社会党中央委员会和德国人民，表示热烈的、兄弟般的祝贺。
    刘少奇说：中国人民都知道威廉·皮克同志是德国工人阶级和德国人民的忠实的儿子、国际工人运动的杰出的活动家、德国统一社会党的组织者和领导者。威廉·皮克同志从青年时代到80岁高龄的长时期内把自己的全部精力献给了工人阶级和劳动人民的解放事业。他在国际工人运动和建立德国工人阶级政党的事业中，在反对侵略战争、维护世界和平和争取德国和平统一的斗争中，都作出了光辉的贡献。因此，威廉·皮克同志不仅受到德国工人阶级和德国人民真诚的爱戴，同时也受到中国工人阶级、中国人民和世界工人阶级和一切爱好和平的人民的敬仰。
    刘少奇说：中德两国友好合作关系的日益发展和巩固是同威廉·皮克同志的直接关怀分不开的。这次以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团的友好访问和同中华人民共和国缔结的中德友好合作条约，对于进一步发展中德友好关系和合作作了重大的贡献。在这个时候适逢威廉·皮克同志的80岁寿辰，我们感到格外地高兴。
    招待会上，波兰大使基里洛克、印度大使拉·库·尼赫鲁和苏联大使尤金都先后起立致词，热烈祝贺皮克总统80寿辰。
    席间，宾主一再举杯，祝贺皮克总统万寿无疆。
