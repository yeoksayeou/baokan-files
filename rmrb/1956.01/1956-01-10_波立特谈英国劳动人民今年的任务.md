Xinhua News Agency, London, January 8th: According to TASS, a mass meeting celebrating the 26th anniversary of the "Daily Worker" was held on January 8th in "Albert Hall," one of London's largest halls. Representatives from a wide range of British working people attended the meeting.

  　British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt spoke at the meeting.

    Pollitt summarized the past year of 1955, pointing out that this year would be memorable in Britain, mainly because "peace-loving British people have clearly understood that they will never support a war against socialist countries in the world."

    When discussing the tasks of the British labor movement in 1956, Pollitt called on the working people to strengthen unity of action in order to effectively fight for their rights, including fighting for higher wages, improved living conditions, and increased pensions.

    Pollitt also called on the British working people to tirelessly fight for the consolidation of world peace. He pointed out that the main demands in this regard should be: banning weapons of mass destruction; universal disarmament; abandoning the arming of West Germany; establishing a European collective security system in which East and West Germany play a certain role; granting the People's Republic of China its legitimate seat in the United Nations; eliminating all restrictions on trade between East and West; stopping the colonial wars in Malaya and Kenya and resolving the Cyprus issue; withdrawing all British troops from the colonies and granting these colonial peoples the right to self-determination.

　　波立特谈英国劳动人民今年的任务
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社伦敦8日讯：1月8日，在伦敦最大的大厅之一“阿尔伯厅”里举行了庆祝“工人日报”创刊26周年的群众大会，大会有英国广泛阶层劳动人民的代表参加。
  　英国共产党总书记波立特在会上讲话。
    波立特对过去的1955年作了总结，他指出，这一年在英国将是值得纪念的，主要是因为“爱好和平的英国人民已经清楚地理解到，他们决不支持反对世界上社会主义国家的战争”。
    波立特在谈到英国工人运动在1956年的任务的时候，号召劳动人民加强行动一致，以便有效地争取自己的权利，其中包括争取提高工资、改善居住条件、提高养老金等。
    波立特还号召英国劳动人民始终不倦地为争取巩固世界和平而斗争。他指出，在这方面的主要要求应当是：禁止大规模毁灭性武器；普遍裁减军备；放弃武装西德；建立东德和西德在里面起一定作用的欧洲集体安全体系；给予中华人民共和国在联合国里的合法席位；消除对东西方之间贸易的各种限制；停止马来亚和怯尼亚的殖民战争和解决塞浦路斯问题；从殖民地撤退所有的英国军队和给予这些殖民地人民自决权。
