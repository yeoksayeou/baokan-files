    A Good Method for Handling the Expansion and Merger of Cooperatives
    Song Haiyan
    In the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, many old agricultural cooperatives have also been expanded or merged. In the work of expansion and merger, like the work of building new cooperatives, there are many outstanding issues (especially economic procedural issues) that have not been resolved due to leaders not keeping pace with the development of the movement. Taking Xuchang Prefecture in Henan Province as an example, among the old cooperatives that have already been expanded or merged, about 80% of the cooperatives have not yet settled their accounts, or there are some outstanding issues that have not been dealt with. Some cooperatives have expanded and merged several times, and new accounts have been added to the old accounts without being cleared. The reason for this situation is, of course, related to the low level of accounting in the cooperatives at present, but more importantly, the working methods for handling specific issues of expansion and merger of cooperatives are not appropriate: every time an old cooperative expands or merges, the livestock, farm implements and other means of production of the new and old members must be re-evaluated and leveled according to a unified standard; the admission share funds of new and old members must not be allowed to have more or less and must be allocated according to the same standard. This "everything starts again" "big mixing mud" approach makes it very troublesome to handle the accounts of expanded and merged cooperatives in the current situation of declining prices of various means of production year by year. Here is a typical example: The agricultural cooperative led by Su Dianxuan in Malou Township, Lushan County, Henan Province, whose accountant Liu Yongtai is a good hand who often teaches experience and "serves as a teacher" for others in the county's agricultural cooperative accounting training class, but the accounts of the cooperative's four expansions and mergers over the past three years have not been cleared. This shows that if the method of handling problems in the expansion and merger of cooperatives is not properly resolved, even a very good accountant will not be able to do it.
    With the rising enthusiasm of farmers for running cooperatives, the wisdom of the masses has also been brought into play. Many new methods suitable for the current situation have also been created in the expansion and merger of old cooperatives. The Pioneer First Agricultural Cooperative in Qili Township, Wuyang County, Henan Province, created a very good method. This cooperative originally had 61 households, and in the autumn of 1955, it expanded to 168 households. In the expansion, it not only absorbed eight mutual aid team members and 20 individual farmers, but also the entire "Pioneer Third Cooperative" (old cooperative) in the township merged into it. The method they adopted was: except that the land was uniformly re-evaluated according to the original standard of the old cooperative, the remaining means of production such as livestock and farm implements were "evaluated separately for new and old members, allocated share funds separately, and used in a centralized and unified manner." The specific method is: first, regard the original old cooperative as a small unit, and its valuation of livestock and farm implements, allocation of admission share funds, etc., are all kept intact according to the original base. The merged third cooperative is also regarded as a small unit, and the handling of farm implements, livestock, share funds, etc. is also kept intact according to the original base. The newly joined members (including individual farmers and mutual aid team members) are also regarded as a new small unit, and the handling of their admission livestock and farm implements is the same as the method of a new cooperative: evaluate admission according to the number of livestock and farm implements needed by the land in this unit; allocate share funds based on the principle that most members can afford it. As a result, the share funds of the whole cooperative are 6.7 yuan per mu for old members (the original, unchanged), 4.5 yuan per mu for the merged third cooperative (the original, unchanged), and an average of 2.5 yuan per mu for new members. Secondly, after the share funds of each household are determined, they are uniformly recorded in the account of the whole cooperative, and the members' savings and debts are established with the cooperative. Finally, on the basis of the above, the labor force of the whole cooperative (including new and old members) is uniformly organized into teams, the livestock and farm implements are uniformly allocated and used, the land is uniformly divided into cultivated areas... In short, everything in the whole cooperative after the expansion is unified, only the share funds of new and old members are not equal. This approach not only saves trouble for cadres and accountants, but also satisfies the masses very much. The cadres of the cooperative said: We will not worry about the expansion of the cooperative every year in the future. The new members said: I used to worry that the threshold of the old cooperative was too high and I couldn't afford to join (referring to the old cooperative's solid foundation and fear of not being able to afford the share funds), but now I feel relieved with this method. The old members said: Our livestock and farm implements were handled reasonably before, and now we have no objection to not moving them. Although the new members pay less for livestock and farm implements; but it is enough to cultivate the land of the new members, so of course it is reasonable.
    Of course, due to different conditions in various places, many problems that need to be studied and solved will arise when implementing this method, but in general, this is a simple and easy-to-implement good method, suitable for the needs of the new situation where the expansion and merger of cooperatives are increasing day by day. Xuchang Prefecture is currently promoting this method in an all-round way.

    一个处理扩社、并社问题的好办法
    宋海晏
    在农业合作化的高潮中，很多老的农业合作社也都进行了扩大或合并。在扩社、并社工作中，也和新建社工作一样，由于领导赶不上运动的发展，有很多遗留问题（特别是经济手续问题）没有得到解决。以河南省许昌专区为例，在已经进行扩、并的老社当中，有80％左右的社账目还没有结清，或者有一些遗留问题还没有处理。有些社由于扩大和合并了几次，老账没有结清又加上了新账。产生这种情况的原因，固然和目前社内会计水平低有关系，但是更重要的，是处理扩社、并社具体问题的工作方法不妥当：老社每当扩、并一次，总要把新、老社员的牲口、农具等生产资料，重新按统一标准作价推平；新老社员的入社股份基金，不允许有多有少而必须按同一标准去摊。这种“一切重来”的“大混泥”的做法，在目前各种生产资料价格逐年下降的情况下，使处理扩、并社账目成了一件非常麻烦的事情。有这样一个典型例子：河南省鲁山县马楼乡苏殿选领导的农业合作社，会计刘永泰是经常在县的农业合作社会计训练班上传授经验，给别人“当老师”的好把式，但是本社三年多来扩、并四次的账目一直清理不了。这说明，如果不把扩、并社中处理问题的方法加以妥善解决，即使有很好的会计，也是不行的。
    随着农民办社热情的高涨，群众的智慧也发挥出来了。在老社扩、并问题上也创造了很多适合目前形势的新办法。河南省舞阳县七里乡先锋第一农业合作社创造了一个很好的办法。这个社原有61户，1955年秋季扩大为168户。扩社中不仅吸收了八户互助组员和20户单干农民，而且本乡的一个“先锋第三社”（老社）也全部并入。他们所采用的方法是：除了土地统一以老社原有的标准重新评定入社产量以外，其余牲口、农具等生产资料，都采取了“新老社员分别评价入社，分别摊股份基金，集中统一使用”的办法。具体作法是：首先，把原来老社看作一个小单位，它的牲口农具作价、入社股份基金的摊派等，都按原来老底原封不动。并入的第三社也作为一个小单位，农具牲口、股份基金等问题的处理也按原来的老底原封不动。刚进来的新社员（包括单干农民和互助组组员），也看作一个新的小单位，他们入社牲口、农具的处理，和一个新建社的办法一样：根据本单位土地所需要的牲口、农具数量，评价入社；以多数社员出得起为原则，摊出股份基金。这样做的结果，全社股份基金，老社员每亩地摊六元七角（原来的，没有动），并入的第三社每亩摊四元五角（原来的，没有动），新社员平均每亩地摊二元五角。其次，在各户股份基金确定以后，统一记到全社账上，社员存欠分别同社建立债务关系。最后，在上述基础上，把全社（包括新老社员在内）劳力统一编队，牲口、农具统一分配使用，土地统一划分耕作区……总之，扩大后全社一切都统一，只有新老社员的股份基金不相等。这种作法不仅干部和会计感到省事，群众也非常满意。社干部说：今后社年年扩大也不发愁了。新社员说：以前总担心老社门坎高，入不起（指老社底子厚，怕摊不起股份基金），现在有这种办法算放心了。老社员说：咱那牲口、农具以前处理得就合理，现在不动没意见。新社员摊的牲口、农具价款虽然少些；但是够种新社员的土地的需要，当然合情合理。
    当然，由于各地情况不同，在实行这个办法的时候还会出现很多需要研究解决的问题，但是总的说来，这是一个简便易行的好办法，适合于扩社、并社日渐增多的新形势的需要。目前许昌专区正在全面推广这一办法。
