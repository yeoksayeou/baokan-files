Good News Spreads Amidst Cheers of Victory
　　　　Wang Zengxiang
　　The good news of joint state-private ownership brought an immense force to the workers of the privately-owned Zhiyuan Fountain Pen Factory. In just over ten days, a new atmosphere appeared everywhere in the factory.

　　On the 28th of last month, the good news that the public representative would be coming to the factory spread here. At that time, the workers were listening to a report outside the factory, and the union cadres who remained in the factory began to clean the yard, wipe the glass, and put up slogans welcoming joint state-private ownership on the walls. When the workers returned after listening to the report, they could hardly believe their eyes. Could this day that they had been looking forward to day and night really have arrived? When the union chairman officially announced the news to the workers, a burst of applause immediately erupted in the hall. Someone in the crowd suggested, "I propose that we complete the production task one day ahead of schedule today and strive to deliver the finished products tomorrow to welcome the public representative to the factory." This suggestion was agreed to by all the workers, and they set about their work. That night, they rushed to make nearly a box of automatic propelling pencils, completing all the products that should have been delivered the next day.

　　On the 3rd of this month, the public representative was about to arrive. The assembly group, which had always lagged behind in the labor competition and only "responded" to challenges, was the first to put forward a challenge this time. They guaranteed that they would use practical actions of improving quality and exceeding the quantity to welcome joint state-private ownership. In the past, this group could only assemble 30 dozens of pen caps or clips each day. On the 7th, they implemented an assembly line method according to professional division of labor and assembled 40 dozens in one day for the first time.

　　Not only were the workers in the assembly group energized, but the workers in other groups were the same. In the past, the lever pressing group used two people to operate one machine, working for a while and then resting for a while. Every time they finished resting and resumed work, they always had to produce ten or so defective products before they could start normal production. In this way, not only was more than an hour of working time wasted every day, but also a lot of raw materials were wasted. Hearing that joint state-private ownership was about to be implemented, Guo Qingkui in this group was very excited. He discussed with his partner Ma Shuwang and changed from two people operating at the same time to one person operating and the other person doing auxiliary work. When the operating person got tired, the second person would take over. In this way, not only were defective products reduced, but work efficiency was also improved. They originally planned to press 1,200 levers per day, but on the 8th, which was the first day they proposed the challenge, they reached 1,500. The next day, they pressed more than nine hundred in four hours. Zhang Chunjiang of the milling group was not very active in his work in the past, but after returning from participating in the mobilization meeting of the Xidan District Youth Assault Team, he installed a raw material tray on the machine and fixed the cooling water pipe. In addition, he did other preparatory work before starting work. On the 8th, he made two hundred pencil parts, doubling the planned daily output. Fan Shilin, who was responsible for making the thread buckle on the pencil barrel, planned to make 150 dozens per day. This time, because he improved the tools, he made 190 dozens. Due to the high production enthusiasm and creativity of all the workers, production efficiency has greatly improved compared to the past.

　　These days, although the workers have been busy with rallies and parades to celebrate their great happy event, the production tasks have not been affected. On the 10th, they had already completed the task of producing one hundred dozens of automatic propelling pencils on time. Now, this factory has been officially approved to implement joint state-private ownership. The delighted workers are working hard to further improve quality and output.

    喜报声里传捷报
    王增祥
    公私合营的喜讯给私营志源金笔厂的职工们带来了一股无比的力量，在短短的十几天里，这座工厂到处出现了新气象。
    上月28日，公方驻厂员将要下厂的喜讯传到了这里，这时，职工们正在厂外听报告，留在厂里的工会干部们就动手清扫了院子，擦净了玻璃，墙上也贴了迎接公私合营的标语。职工们听完报告回来一看，简直有点不相信自己的眼睛，难道这个日夜盼望着的日子真的来了吗？当工会主席正式向职工宣布了这个消息以后，会场上立刻响起了一阵掌声。人群中有人提出：“我建议在今天提前一天完成生产任务，争取明天交出成品，来迎接公方驻厂员下厂。”这个建议得到全体职工的同意，大家就分头干起活来。这天晚上，他们赶做出了将近一箱的自动转铅笔，完成了应该在第二天交货的全部产品。
    本月3日，公方驻厂员快要来了。过去在劳动竞赛中一向走在后面“应战”的装配小组，这一回第一个提出了挑战。他们保证要用提高质量和超额完成数量的实际行动来迎接公私合营。这个小组从前不管是上笔帽还是上卡子，每天只能装配30打。7日这天，他们按照专业分工，实行了流水作业法，第一次在一天内装配了40打。
    不但装配组的工人来了劲，别组工人也是一样。压杆组过去两个人操纵一台机器，干一会儿，歇一会儿。每当休息完了，再恢复工作的时候，总得先出十来个废品，然后才能开始正常生产。这样，每天不仅要浪费一个多小时的工时，而且还要糟蹋不少原料。听说要公私合营了，这个组的郭庆奎非常兴奋，他跟同伴马树往一商量，由两人同时操作改成一人操作，另一人做辅助工作。操作的人干累了，再由第二个人接着干。这样一来，不仅减少了废品，同时也提高了工作效率。他们原计划每天压杆1，200个，在8日这一天，就是他们提出应战的第一天，就达到了1，500个。第二天，他们在四小时里又压出了九百多个。铣活组的张春江，过去工作不大积极，可是他参加了西单区青年突击队誓师大会回来以后，就动手在机器上装好了原料盘，并且固定了降温水管，加上在开始工作前做好其他准备工作，在8日这一天，他做铅笔零件就达到了二百个，比计划日产量提高一倍。负责做笔杆套丝扣的范士麟，计划每天作150打，这次因为改进了工具，做出了190打。由于全体职工都有这样高的生产热情和创造精神，生产效率比以前大大提高了。
    这几天，虽然职工们都忙着集会游行，庆祝自己的大喜事，但是生产任务并没有受到影响。10日这一天，他们已经按时完成了生产一百打自动转铅笔的任务。现在，这个厂已经正式被批准实行公私合营了，兴高采烈的职工们，正在为进一步提高质量和产量而努力。
