Three Measures for Increasing Agricultural Production in Jiangxi Province
Liu Junxiu, Second Deputy Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee

In 1953, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee proposed three measures for increasing production: converting single-season rice into double-season rice (including converting mid-season rice into early-season rice), converting dry land into paddy fields, and converting wasteland into cultivated land. After focused trials, significant production increases were achieved.

In 1954, led by state-owned farms and cooperatives, Jiangxi Province mobilized mutual aid teams and individual farmers to convert over one million mu of single-season rice to double-season rice, mid-season rice to early-season rice, and dry land to paddy fields during the spring cultivation. However, in the summer, the province suffered the worst flood in a century, with over 7.6 million mu of farmland inundated. From August onwards, it also suffered over three months of autumn drought. To compensate for the severe losses caused by the floods and drought, Party and government leading organs at all levels actively mobilized the masses to fight against the disasters, and also rushed to plant and replant over 500,000 mu of double-season late rice and expand/replant over 8.1 million mu of late autumn grain crops. Due to the expansion of the replanting area, the total grain output of the province remained at the level of the bumper year of 1952 (11.5 billion catties).

Gao'an County achieved particularly outstanding results in promoting the conversion of single-season rice to double-season rice in 1954. During the spring cultivation that year, a considerable number of staff members lacked confidence in completing the production increase tasks because they had not found a way to increase production. After the summer, they suffered eight floods in succession, and many staff members and farmers were uncertain about whether they could maintain the output of 1953. At this time, the county Party committee seized the production increase link of converting single-season rice into double-season rice, relied on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and led the entire peasant masses to promote the conversion of over 20,000 mu of single-season rice to double-season rice throughout the county. After the summer floods, the county Party committee led the cadres and peasants of the county to actively and resolutely expand the planting of double-season late rice. As a result, the total grain output of the county increased by 5.9% compared with 1953.

State-owned farms in Jiangxi Province also achieved remarkable results in promoting the three production increase measures in 1954. Among the 87 farms in the province, 38 farms suffered relatively severe floods in the summer, with the inundated farmland accounting for more than one-third of the total area of the farms. However, because 71 farms promoted production increase measures such as converting single-season rice into double-season rice, mid-season rice into early-season rice, and dry land into paddy fields, the total grain output of farms across the province still increased by 10.8% compared with 1953.

In the winter of 1954, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee led rural cadres and peasants throughout the province to step up water conservancy construction, accumulate and manufacture a large amount of fertilizer, and fully prepare seeds to prepare for the planned and step-by-step implementation of the three production increase measures in 1955. In 1955, more than 1.1 million mu of single-season rice were converted to double-season rice across the province, with an average increase of 250 catties of rice per mu, for a total increase of more than 275 million catties of rice; 300,000 mu of mid-season rice were converted to early-season rice, and autumn dryland grain crops were planted an additional time, with an average increase of 60 catties of rice equivalent per mu, for a total increase of 18 million catties; 100,000 mu of dry land were converted to paddy fields, with an average increase of 250 catties of rice per mu, for a total increase of 25 million catties; in addition, nearly 5 million mu of autumn fallow land after the harvest of early and mid-season rice were utilized to expand the planting of autumn grain crops, with an average increase of 60 catties of rice equivalent per mu, for a total increase of 300 million catties of grain. The above items totaled an increase of 618 million catties of grain. In 1955, Gao'an County increased its double-season rice by more than 102,000 mu, increasing grain production by 20.65 million catties. In the past, Jiujiang Prefecture only had some double-season rice planted in counties such as Xiushui and Jiujiang. Other counties had none or very little double-season rice planted. In 1955, a total of 164,766 mu of single-season rice were converted to double-season rice in the entire prefecture, with universal increases in production. Xingzi County, which is backed by Mount Lu and faces Poyang Lake, is a place with a lower temperature in the province, and double-season rice had never been planted in the past. Double-season rice was first trial-planted in 1953 and expanded to more than 27,000 mu in 1955. Just by expanding double-season rice, the county's rice production in 1955 increased by more than 6.6 million catties compared to 1954.

The implementation of the three production increase measures has powerfully promoted the development of the cooperative movement. The Pan Shi Agricultural Cooperative in Jiujiang County, with 25 households, had wanted to change single-season rice to double-season rice when they were working individually in the past. However, due to insufficient water sources, fertilizer, and labor, they had not succeeded after several years. After the agricultural production cooperative was organized, the entire cooperative converted 11.7 mu of single-season rice fields into double-season rice in 1955, and each mu obtained a high yield of 1,195 catties. Among them, 1.35 mu of paddy field harvested 1,935 catties of rice, which was twice as high as the yield of the surrounding farmers. The cooperative was also expanded. The Daqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative of Yuhe Village, Daqiao District, Jiujiang County, had only 10 households when it was established. In 1955, they converted 25 mu of single-season rice to double-season rice, with a total increase of 6,250 catties of rice, averaging an increase of 250 catties of rice per mu. After the autumn harvest, many farmers actively requested to join this cooperative. The implementation of the three production increase measures requires the construction of water conservancy projects, the accumulation and manufacture of a large amount of fertilizer, and the increase of replanting area, intensive cultivation and meticulous farming. This not only can solve the "surplus labor force" problem of the cooperatives in large quantities, but also can fully exert the effectiveness of the labor force.

The improvement of agricultural production has further improved the material living standards of farmers. For example, in Xingzi County, due to the large-scale implementation of converting single-season rice to double-season rice, mid-season rice to early-season rice, and dry land to paddy fields in 1955, the county increased rice production by 7.58 million catties compared to 1954, and the average purchasing power of farmers after the autumn harvest increased by 11.4% compared to 1954. In 1954, there were only 153 surplus grain households in Xingfu Township of this county. After the implementation of the three production increase measures in 1955, the number of surplus grain households has increased to 327 households.

In the past, a considerable number of county and district staff members and farmers had concerns about implementing the three production increase measures. Some staff members worried that "production would decrease if the conversion didn't go well." Some farmers believed: "Early rice is a treasure, late rice is grass. If planting two seasons can increase production, why didn't our ancestors know to plant it in the past?" Now, because the implementation of the three production increase measures has achieved significant production increases, these doubts have been eliminated. In the winter of 1955, farmers throughout the province were vigorously building water conservancy projects, accumulating large amounts of fertilizer, preparing seeds, and adding draft cattle and farm tools to create conditions for the implementation of the three production increase measures in 1956. Many agricultural production cooperatives have proposed production increase plans for 1956 of 25%-35%, or even 40%-50%.

Jiangxi Province has basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperation. There are already better conditions for greatly increasing production. The Provincial Party Committee plans to convert 2 million mu of single-season rice to double-season rice, convert mid-season rice to early-season rice, and utilize autumn fallow land after the harvest of early and mid-season rice to expand the planting of autumn grain dryland crops by 5 million mu, convert 150,000 mu of dry land to paddy fields, and convert 750,000 mu of wasteland to cultivated land in 1956. The yield per unit area of other farmlands should also be increased. The above production increase measures can increase grain production by 2 billion to 2.1 billion catties. After implementing these measures, this year's targets for the final year of the Five-Year Plan can be overfulfilled.

    江西省农业增产的三项措施
    中共江西省委第二副书记　刘俊秀
    江西省委在1953年提出了一季稻变双季稻（包括中稻变早稻）、旱地变水田、荒地变熟地的三项增产措施，有重点地试行以后，取得了显著的增产效果。
    1954年，江西省以国营农场和合作社为主，带动互助组和单干农民，在春耕生产中，一季稻变双季稻、中稻变早稻、旱地变水稻田共达一百多万亩。但是，在夏季遭受了百年来未有的特大洪水，被淹田亩760多万亩。从8月以后，又遭受了3个多月的秋旱。为了弥补水旱灾害的严重损失，各级党政领导机关除积极发动群众同水旱灾害作斗争外，并且在秋季抢种、补种双季晚稻50多万亩，扩种、补种晚秋粮食作物810多万亩。由于扩大了复种面积，全省粮食总产量仍然保持在丰收的1952年的水平上（115亿斤）。
    高安县在1954年推行一季稻变双季稻的增产成绩是较为突出的。这一年春耕时期，有相当一部分工作人员，因为没有找到增产的门路，对于完成增产任务缺乏信心。入夏后，又先后遭受了八次洪水侵袭，许多工作人员和农民群众对于能不能保持1953年的产量也没有把握。这时候，县委抓住了一季稻变双季稻这个增产环节，依靠互助合作组织，带动全体农民群众，在全县推行了一季稻变双季稻2万多亩。在夏季洪水成灾后，县委又领导全县干部和农民，积极地坚决地扩种双季晚稻。结果，全县粮食总产量比1953年还增加了5.9％。
    江西省的国营农场1954年在推行三项增产措施中间也获得了显著的成绩。全省87个农场中，在夏季有38个农场受到了较严重的水灾，被淹田亩占农场总面积的三分之一以上。但是，由于有71个农场推行了一季稻变双季稻、中稻变早稻、旱地变水田等增产措施，全省农场粮食的总产量仍然比1953年增加了10.8％。
    1954年冬季，江西省委领导全省农村干部和农民加紧作好水利建设，大量积肥造肥，充分准备种子，为1955年有计划有步骤地推行三项增产措施作了准备。1955年，全省一季稻变双季稻110多万亩，平均每亩增产稻谷250斤，共增产稻谷27，500多万斤；中稻变早稻30万亩，多种一次秋季旱地粮食作物，每亩平均增产折稻谷60斤，共增产1，800万斤；旱地变水田10万亩，每亩平均增产稻谷250斤，共增产2，500万斤；此外，还利用了早中稻收割后的秋闲田，扩种秋季粮食作物将近500万亩，每亩平均增产折稻谷60斤，共增产粮食3亿斤。以上几项共增产粮食61，800万斤。高安县双季稻1955年增加了102，000多亩，增产粮食2，065万斤。九江专区往年除修水、九江等县有部分田种双季稻外，别的县都没有或很少种过双季稻；1955年全区一季改双季稻的共有164，766亩，普遍增产。背靠庐山、面临鄱阳湖的星子县，是省内气温较低的地方，过去从来没种过双季稻。从1953年开始试种双季稻，到1955年扩大到27，000多亩。只是扩大双季稻这一项，全县1955年的稻谷比1954年增产了660多万斤。
    推行三项增产措施的结果，有力地推动了合作化运动的发展。九江县磻石农业合作社25户，过去单干的时候，也曾想把一季稻改为双季稻，可是，由于水源、肥料、劳力不足，搞了几年都没有成功。组织了农业生产合作社以后，1955年全社把一季稻田11亩7分变为双季稻，每亩获得了1，195斤的高额产量，其中有1亩3分5厘水稻田收稻谷1，935斤，比周围农民的产量高出两倍；合作社也扩大了。九江县大桥区虞河村大桥农业生产合作社成立的时候只有10户，1955年他们以一季稻变双季稻25亩，共增产稻谷6，250斤，每亩平均增产稻谷250斤。秋收以后，很多农民积极要求加入这个合作社。推行三项增产措施，需要兴修水利，大量积肥造肥和增加复种面积，精耕细作，这样，不仅可以大量地解决合作社“剩余劳动力”的出路问题，而且能够充分地发挥劳动力的效力。
    农业生产的提高，进一步提高了农民的物质生活水平。如星子县，由于1955年大面积推行了一季稻变双季稻，中稻变早稻，旱地变水田，全县比1954年增产了稻谷758万斤，秋收后农民购买力平均比1954年提高了11.4％。这个县的幸福乡1954年仅有153户余粮户，1955年推行了三项增产措施，余粮户已经增加到327户。
    过去，有相当一部分县、区工作人员和农民对推行三项增产措施有顾虑。有些工作人员担心“变不好会减产”。有些农民认为：“早稻是宝，晚稻是草。如果种两季能增产，为什么过去老祖宗们不晓得去种？”现在，由于推行三项增产措施获得显著的增产成绩，这些怀疑消除了。1955年冬季，全省农民都在大力兴修水利，大量积蓄肥料，准备种子，添买耕牛、农具，为1956年推行三项增产措施创造条件。许多农业生产合作社都提出了1956年增产25％—35％，甚至40％—50％的增产计划。
    江西省已经基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。大量增加生产已经有了更好的条件。省委计划在1956年一季稻变双季稻200万亩，中稻变早稻，并且利用早、中稻收割后的秋间田扩大秋季粮食旱作物500万亩，旱地变水田15万亩，荒地变熟地75万亩，别的田地也都要提高单位面积产量；以上几项增产措施共可增产粮食20亿到21亿斤。实现这些措施以后，今年就可以超额完成五年计划最后一年的指标。
