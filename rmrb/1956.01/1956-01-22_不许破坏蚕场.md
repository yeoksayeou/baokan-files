To the Editor:

In October 1955, the Xiuyan Large Cocoon Raw Material Supply Station needed a large number of baskets to transport silkworm cocoons. They privately sent people to the Tangchi, Baiyun, Longtan, and other districts to sign contracts with some agricultural production cooperatives to weave more than 26,000 baskets using oak branches. These places cut down a total of more than 730,000 catties of oak branches, destroying a total of 1,592 hectares of silkworm farms.

After the Xiuyan County Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry discovered the farmers' indiscriminate cutting of oak branches, they raised objections to the supply station several times, suggesting that they use miscellaneous tree branches to weave baskets. However, Mu Changxiang, the person in charge of the supply station, nonchalantly said, "There are so many oak farms, what's the harm in cutting a little!" The Director of the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry had to personally explain the pros and cons to him, requesting that he stop using oak branches. He hypocritically agreed not to use oak branches to weave baskets anymore; however, on the other hand, he let the heads of the agricultural cooperatives who had signed contracts with the supply station conceal the situation of destroying silkworm farms from the agricultural and forestry section. Mu Changxiang's behavior is very wrong, and we hope that the relevant leading authorities will seriously correct it.

    不许破坏蚕场编辑同志：
    岫岩大茧原料供应站在1955年10月间需要大批笼筐装运蚕茧。他们就私自派人到汤池、白云、龙潭等区同一些农业生产合作社签订了用柞树条编制26，000多个笼筐的合同。这些地方砍掉的柞树条共有73万多斤，一共破坏了蚕场1，592垧。
    岫岩县农林局发现农民滥砍柞树条的情况以后，曾几次向供应站提出意见，建议他们改用杂树条来编笼筐。但是，供应站负责人牟长祥却满不在乎地说：“柞场这么多，砍点没有啥！”农林局局长只得亲自去向他说明利害，要求停止采用柞树条。他一方面虚伪地答应不再用柞树条来编笼筐；另一方面却让同供应站签订合同的农业社社长向农林科隐瞒破坏蚕场的情况。牟长祥这种行为是十分错误的，希望有关领导机关认真加以纠正。
