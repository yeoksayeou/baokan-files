　　Striving to Complete the National Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Wu Xiang, Chun Xun
    In the past two years, the Shanxi Daily has actively and proactively participated in the struggle to complete the national plan in its industrial propaganda, providing some practical assistance to the staff of factories and enterprises.

    More than two years ago, the Shanxi Daily editorial department did not have a sufficient understanding of this point, so it did not actively and proactively carry out propaganda on the completion of the national plan. Although the newspaper published many reports on the completion of the national plan, these reports only appeared at the end of the month, the end of the quarter, and the end of the year. In terms of content, most of them were just a list of numbers, and there had been mistakes of blindness and one-sidedness. Some enterprises, on the surface, completed the plan, but in reality, they only completed the output value and output plan, without achieving the planned targets in terms of quality, cost, variety, and balance rate; or they completed it by illegitimate means such as working overtime; or the plan itself was very conservative and backward. The newspaper only "objectively" reported their achievements in completing the national plan, which not only failed to promote the work but also fostered the conservative ideas and one-sided views of some enterprise leaders.

    During the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in 1953, under the instruction of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, the Shanxi Daily editorial department examined and criticized the above-mentioned purely objective propaganda attitude and began to actively and proactively participate in the struggle to complete the national plan. Since then, the newspaper has been able to discover problems more deeply, raise problems more promptly, and effectively use the methods of praise and criticism to encourage and urge the broad masses of workers to strive for the comprehensive and over-fulfillment of the national plan.

    In order to improve the propaganda on the completion of the national plan, the Shanxi Daily has taken the following measures:

    Strengthening contact with reality and grasping the situation of each enterprise in completing the national plan is the basis for doing a good job in reporting on the completion of the national plan. In order to grasp the situation, the Shanxi Daily editorial department not only strengthened contact with the Provincial Party Committee's Industry Department, the Provincial Planning Commission, the Statistics Bureau, the Supervision Department, and the People's Bank, but also established contact with more than a dozen major factories and mines in the province. In this way, it gradually figured out the "bottom line" of the plans of each factory and mine and learned about the implementation of the plans and the problems. Grasping the situation must also have a comprehensive perspective, not only paying attention to output value and output, but also paying attention to quality, cost, variety, balance rate, labor productivity, etc.; not only paying attention to the average figures of the whole factory, but also paying attention to whether each workshop has completed the plan; not only understanding the advanced indicators in the province, but also understanding the indicators of advanced regions in the country, and comparing the two. This can avoid blindness and one-sidedness in propaganda. For example, in October 1954, the province's local state-owned industry completed the profit submission plan ahead of schedule, and the newspaper did not rush to publish it as soon as it saw a "new record" as it had done in the past, because the editorial department knew that the original plans of many enterprises were conservative. After the newspaper conducted an investigation by reporters, it criticized the Yuci Enterprise Company, which had the most conservative plan.

    The second is to promptly clarify the main problems that must be solved in each period in order to complete the national plan. The newspaper should not only passively reflect the situation of industrial and mining enterprises in completing the national plan, nor should it just explain the political and economic significance of completing the national plan in general terms. It should promptly and specifically clarify the problems in completing the plan and mobilize the broad masses of workers to solve them. This requires the editorial department to study and grasp the characteristics of industrial production in different periods and the characteristics of different enterprises, and to carry out propaganda in light of these characteristics. For example, in the first quarter of 1954, the Shanxi Daily studied the fact that the plans of various enterprises in the first quarter had not been formally approved, and people easily ignored them, and because of the Spring Festival holiday, there were fewer working days and lower attendance rates. It then paid special attention to the propaganda on the completion of the first quarter's production plan, and proposed the call that the production in the first quarter should not be lower than the actual level of the fourth quarter of the previous year, and used the example of the Datong Mining Bureau to illustrate that this was entirely possible. In the fourth quarter of 1955, the Shanxi Daily, in view of the poor preparation work for production in 1955 and the more arduous tasks undertaken by industrial and mining enterprises in 1956, prominently carried out propaganda on doing a good job in the preparation work for industrial production in 1956. Different industries also have different characteristics. Coal mines should pay special attention to the mining ratio, that is, whether they have prepared the amount of coal and working face for the next month; the machine industry has many processes, and the internal transfer time of semi-finished products is long, so special attention should be paid to the situation of semi-finished products and spare parts. The Shanxi Daily also paid attention to organizing reports in light of these characteristics.

    The third is to vigorously use the weapons of praise and criticism. Completing the national plan is a serious struggle. The responsibility of the newspaper is to set examples and constantly criticize various erroneous tendencies in order to promote the advanced to lead the backward and the backward to catch up with the advanced. The Shanxi Daily carried out criticism and self-criticism more forcefully in the propaganda of completing the national plan. Taking 1954 as an example, in the struggle to complete the national plan for the first quarter, the newspaper focused on criticizing the conservative thinking of some units that emphasized objective difficulties and set the plan too low. After some units reversed the situation of failing to complete the plan in the first quarter every year, they developed a slack and complacent mood, and the newspaper published an editorial using the example of the Yangquan Mining Bureau to criticize them. In addition, irreconcilable struggles were also carried out against the false behavior of units such as the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory and the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in completing the plan. These criticisms are generally more timely and can serve as a warning to people.

    Compared with criticism, the work of praising examples was once relatively weak. However, recently, the Shanxi Daily has significantly strengthened the propaganda of advanced figures, units, and advanced experiences of great significance in completing the national plan excellently. Here are two examples. After learning the operating methods of Kolesnikov, an outstanding Soviet steel worker, the workers of the steelmaking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant continuously created new records of rapid steelmaking. In addition to prominently reporting this fact, the Shanxi Daily also published an editorial calling on workers throughout the province to learn their spirit. The Datong Ephedrine Factory used to be a backward factory that often failed to complete the plan. Since 1955, it has gradually promoted economic accounting and changed the original situation, completing the national plan ahead of schedule and comprehensively. The newspaper seized this example to vigorously promote the superiority of the team economic accounting system and gave a detailed introduction to the factory's experience in implementing the team economic accounting system.

    As a result of the Shanxi Daily's efforts in the above aspects, it has improved the ideological and militant nature of the propaganda of completing the national plan. However, the Shanxi Daily still has many shortcomings in this propaganda, such as the lack of in-depth propaganda on labor emulation and the lack of due attention to the propaganda of trial-producing new products. This requires the Shanxi Daily to further improve the propaganda of completing the national plan and more vigorously mobilize the broad masses of workers to strive to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule.

　　为提前完成国家计划而斗争
    吴象　春旬
    山西日报在最近两年多来的工业宣传中，积极地主动地参加了为完成国家计划的斗争，给了工厂企业的工作人员一些实际的帮助。
    两年多以前，山西日报编辑部对这一点还认识不够，所以没有积极地主动地进行关于完成国家计划的宣传。报上虽然也发表了不少完成国家计划的报道，但这种报道只是在月末、季末、年终才出现，从内容上看，又大半是数字罗列，而且曾经发生过盲目性和片面性的错误。有些企业从表面上看计划是完成了，实际上只是完成了产值、产量计划，在质量、成本、品种、均衡率等方面却没有达到计划指标；或者是靠加班加点的不正当方法来完成的；或者计划本身就十分保守落后。报纸只是“客观地”报道它们完成国家计划的成绩，不但不能起推动工作的作用，反而会助长某些企业领导人员的保守思想、片面观点。
    1953年增产节约运动中，山西日报编辑部在山西省委的指示下，检查和批判了上述的纯客观的宣传态度，开始积极地主动地参加到完成国家计划的斗争中去。从此，报纸就能比较深入地发现问题，比较及时地提出问题，并且有效地运用表扬和批评的方法，来鼓励和督促广大职工为全面和超额完成国家计划而努力。
    山西日报为了改进完成国家计划的宣传，曾经采取过下面一些做法：
    加强联系实际，掌握各企业完成国家计划的情况，这是做好完成国家计划报道的基础。为了掌握情况，山西日报编辑部不仅同省委工业部、省的计划委员会、统计局、监察厅、人民银行等单位加强联系；而且同省内十几个主要厂矿建立了联系。这样，就逐渐地摸到了各厂矿计划的“底”，了解到执行计划的情况和问题。掌握情况还要有全面观点，不仅要注意产值、产量，同时要注意质量、成本、品种、均衡率、劳动生产率等；不仅要注意全厂的平均数字，而且要注意每个车间是否都完成了计划；不仅要了解省内的先进指标，而且要了解全国先进地区的指标，并拿两者作比较。这样就可以避免宣传上的盲目性和片面性。比如1954年10月全省地方国营工业提前完成了上缴利润计划，报纸便没有像过去那样一见是“新纪录”就赶紧刊登，因为编辑部知道许多企业原订的计划是保守的。报纸在经过记者的调查以后，反而对计划最保守的榆次企业公司进行了批评。
    其次是及时阐明每个时期为完成国家计划所必须解决的主要问题。报纸固然不应当只是被动地反映工矿企业完成国家计划的情况，也不应当只是泛泛地讲解完成国家计划的政治意义和经济意义。它应当及时地具体地阐明完成计划当中的问题，动员广大职工来加以解决。这就要求编辑部研究和掌握工业生产各个不同时期的特点和各种不同企业的特点，针对这些特点进行宣传。比如1954年第一季度，山西日报研究了第一季度各个企业的计划未经正式批准，人们容易忽视，又因春节放假，工作日少、出勤率低的情况之后，便特别抓紧了完成第一季度生产计划的宣传，提出了第一季度的生产不低于头年第四季度实际水平的号召，并以大同矿务局的实例来说明这是完全可以做到的。1955年第四季度，山西日报又针对1955年生产准备工作做得不好和1956年工矿企业所担负的任务更加繁重的情况，突出地进行了做好1956年工业生产准备工作的宣传。不同的产业也有不同的特点。像煤矿要特别注意采掘比例，即是否为下月准备了获得煤量和工作面；机器业工序多，在制品内转时间长，就要特别注意在制品和备品的情况。山西日报也注意了针对这些特点来组织报道。
    第三是大力运用表扬和批评的武器。完成国家计划是严重的斗争。报纸的责任在于树立榜样，同时不断地批判各种错误倾向，以推动先进带动落后，落后赶上先进。山西日报在完成国家计划的宣传中，比较有力地开展了批评和自我批评。拿1954年来说，报纸在为争取完成第一季度国家计划的斗争中，就着重地批评过某些单位强调客观困难，把计划订得偏低的保守思想。有些单位扭转了年年第一季度完不成计划的局面以后，产生了松懈自满的情绪，报纸又以阳泉矿务局的例子，发表社论，提出批评。此外，对太原矿山机器厂、太原机车车辆修理工厂等单位在完成计划中的虚假行为，也进行了不调和的斗争。这些批评一般地都是比较及时的，能够起到给人们敲警钟的作用。
    同批评相比，表扬范例的工作有一个时期曾经是比较薄弱的。不过近来山西日报已经显著地加强了对卓越完成国家计划的先进人物、单位和有重大意义的先进经验的宣传。下面就是两个例子。太原钢铁厂炼钢部职工学习了苏联优秀钢铁工人科列斯尼科夫的操作方法后，连续创造了快速炼钢的新纪录。山西日报除对这个事实进行了突出的报道外，还发表了社论，号召全省职工学习他们的这种精神。大同麻黄素厂曾经是经常完不成计划的落后厂，1955年以来，逐步推广经济核算制，改变了原来的局面，提前全面完成了国家计划。报纸又抓住这个事例有力地宣传了班组经济核算制的优越性，并对这个厂推行班组经济核算制的经验作了详细的介绍。
    山西日报从上述几个方面努力的结果，便提高了完成国家计划宣传的思想性和战斗性。但是山西日报在这个宣传中还存在着不少缺点，例如对劳动竞赛的宣传不够深入，对试制新产品的宣传还缺乏应有的重视等。这就要求山西日报进一步改进完成国家计划的宣传，更有力地动员广大职工为提前完成第一个五年计划而斗争。
