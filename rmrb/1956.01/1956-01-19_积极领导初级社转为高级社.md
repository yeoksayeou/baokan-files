Actively Leading the Transition of Elementary Agricultural Cooperatives to Advanced Agricultural Cooperatives
Li Lin, Secretary of the Ping Shun County Party Committee, Shanxi Province

Recently, the cooperative movement in Ping Shun County, Shanxi Province, has experienced new and tremendous development, achieving complete socialist cooperation within a little over two months. All but seven of the county's 410 elementary cooperatives have been merged and transformed into 190 advanced cooperatives. The number of farming households participating in advanced cooperatives accounts for 99.2% of the total number of households. It is estimated that before the spring plowing this year, these remaining seven elementary cooperatives will also be merged and transformed into advanced cooperatives.

However, this situation was largely unexpected by the County Party Committee. What does this illustrate? It shows that Party organizations must constantly be vigilant against the encroachment of right-leaning conservative thinking. Otherwise, while right-leaning conservative thought may have been opposed on the issue of rapidly completing semi-socialist cooperation, it may reappear on the issue of fully socialist cooperation.

Ping Shun County has a relatively strong foundation in cooperation. By the end of 1954, the county had basically achieved semi-socialist cooperation; by December 1955, semi-socialist cooperation had been fully realized. None of the cooperatives established before the spring plowing of 1955 collapsed, and all of them increased production. According to statistics from the original 403 cooperatives that have now been transformed into 190 advanced cooperatives, the total grain output exceeded that of 1950, before the establishment of the cooperatives, by 54%. The old cooperatives with a stronger foundation experienced even greater increases in income. According to a typical survey of 18 old cooperatives, such as Xi Gou and Chuan Di, the total output value of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in 1955 exceeded that before the establishment of the cooperatives by 112%. Even Wu Le Township Cooperative, which saw the smallest increase in production, increased by 30% compared to before its establishment. The production level of the vast majority of cooperatives has surpassed that of prosperous middle peasants. After a certain level of development in production, many cooperatives paid attention to the accumulation of public property, thereby increasing socialist factors economically. According to statistics from 188 cooperatives, before their transformation, 61.7% of the members' means of production were already publicly owned, and the public property accumulated by the cooperatives accounted for 61.9% of the total value of the members' private property. At the same time, in recent years, the proportion of land dividends in these cooperatives has decreased by 3% to 5% each year, and 44 cooperatives have implemented a fixed rent system for land remuneration, with all income beyond the rent going to labor income. This has gradually diminished the concept of private ownership of land among the vast majority of members, thus greatly enhancing the socialist consciousness of the vast majority of members. In addition, the difficulties of households in need were appropriately addressed. All of this demonstrates that a significant portion of the cooperatives in Ping Shun County are fully equipped to transition to advanced cooperatives.

Although the Ping Shun County Party Committee also recognized that the current task was to transition elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, it rigidly applied the past experience of piloting elementary cooperatives, believing that the trial period should be shorter and that fully socialist cooperation would take several years. Because this empiricist thinking was guiding the work, they did not dare to boldly and freely guide the movement forward. In the winter of 1955, the Ping Shun County Party Committee's plan for fully socialist cooperation in the county stipulated that only 10 advanced cooperatives would be piloted in the county in 1956, including only 7% of the county's farming households. As a result, the time for fully socialist cooperation in the county was pushed back to 1959. However, not long after this plan was announced, 220 cooperatives requested to be transformed into advanced cooperatives. Only then did the County Party Committee realize that its plan was far too conservative. Therefore, it immediately adopted a correct approach, revising its plan based on the demands of the masses and launching large-scale political and ideological work to guide fully socialist cooperation.

The County Party Committee recognized that the transition from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives meant abolishing the private ownership of land and major means of production by all members. This was an arduous and complex struggle, and it was imperative to avoid blind optimism and hasty actions, and to do the work more meticulously. Therefore, the County Party Committee conducted a 5-day short-term training for approximately 10,000 Party members and League members, focusing on explaining the Party's policy of fully socialist cooperation. At the same time, through a summary of the cooperative movement over the past 5 years, assessments were made of all Party members and League members, and commendations, criticisms, and disciplinary actions were given to Party members and League members who were active, passive, or degenerate. After this training, the Party had a more reliable core force in the fully socialist cooperative movement.

Next, the County Party Committee organized 60 reporters and 10,000 propagandists throughout the county to carry out large-scale publicity about the transition to advanced cooperatives to 110,000 people in the county, of which 60,000 people directly heard the reports of the reporters. After the publicity, the poor and lower-middle peasants who had originally actively requested to establish advanced cooperatives were even more delighted and full of confidence. The vast majority of rich middle peasants and elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned households, who originally had concerns about the transition to advanced cooperatives, also dispelled their concerns and stabilized their emotions. Cooperatives that had not yet proposed the transition to advanced cooperatives were also considering and applying to transition to advanced cooperatives. The movement developed rapidly, and the ideological awareness of the masses also rapidly increased. Among the 28,845 farming households that transitioned to advanced cooperatives, not a single household expressed a desire to withdraw.

Third, in order to gain experience in establishing advanced cooperatives, the County Party Committee first selected 9 cooperatives for pilot projects. After the pilot projects, the experience was immediately summarized to guide the large-scale fully socialist cooperative movement throughout the county.

After the elementary cooperatives announced their transformation into advanced cooperatives, the superiority of the fully socialist system was immediately demonstrated. The production plans of many cooperatives this year have been continuously revised, yet they still cannot satisfy the members' demands for increased production. The enthusiasm of the vast majority of members for labor has been further enhanced. On the second day of the establishment of the Cheng Guan Advanced Cooperative, 42 women participated in labor. It is estimated that after the establishment of advanced cooperatives, the utilization rate of members' labor will increase by 40% to 50% compared to the past. The masses described this unprecedented production upsurge as: "In previous years, the first and second nines of winter were times to close doors and sit idle, but this year, the first and second nines of winter are times for repairing beaches and filling gullies." Based on the greater enthusiasm of the vast majority of the masses for increased production after fully socialist cooperation, and based on the potential for increased production that can be tapped, the Ping Shun County Party Committee has revised the county's production plan. It has been preliminarily determined to increase the grain production target from the originally planned 8.4% increase over 1955 to 36.7%. If this rate of increase is compared with the rate of increase of the county's cooperatives in the previous 3 years, it is equivalent to five times that of 1953, three point seven times that of 1954, and two point three times that of the bumper harvest of 1955. There is no doubt that following the high tide of fully socialist cooperation, there will be an unprecedented production upsurge.

### 积极领导初级社转为高级社

    积极领导初级社转为高级社
    中共山西省平顺县县委书记　李琳
    最近，山西省平顺县的合作化运动有了新的巨大发展，在两个多月的时间内，便实现了完全社会主义的合作化。全县410个初级合作社，除7个合作社而外，全部合并转为190个高级社，参加高级社的农户已占总农户的99.2％，估计在今年春耕以前，这7个初级合作社也将合并转为高级社。
    但是，这个情况是大大出乎县委的预料的。这说明什么呢？说明党组织必须时时警惕右倾保守思想的侵袭。否则右倾保守思想在迅速完成半社会主义合作化的问题上虽然被反掉了，可是在完全社会主义合作化的问题上又可能出现。
    平顺县是合作化基础较好的一个县，1954年年底全县已经基本上实现了半社会主义的合作化；到1955年12月，已经完全实现了半社会主义的合作化；1955年春耕以前建立的合作社，没有一个垮台，全部增加了生产。据现在转为190个高级社的原来403个合作社的统计，粮食总产量超过建社前1950年的54％。基础较好的老社，收入增加得更多。据西沟、川底等18个老社的典型调查，1955年农林牧的总产值超过建社前的112％，连产量增加最少的吾乐乡合作社，也比建社前增加30％。绝大部分合作社的生产水平都赶过了富裕中农。在生产得到一定的发展以后，许多合作社都注意了公共财产的积累，从经济上增长社会主义因素。据188个合作社的统计，它们在转社以前，社员的生产资料已有61.7％公有化，社里积累的公共财产已占社员私有财产总值的61.9％。同时，几年来由于这些合作社的土地分红比例逐年降低3％到5％，并且有44个合作社实行了土地报酬的死租制，租额以外的收入全归劳动所得，这就使绝大部分社员对土地的私有观念日益淡薄，因此，绝大部分社员的社会主义觉悟有了极大的提高。另外，也适当地解决了困难户的困难。所有这些都说明了平顺县的很大一部分合作社，已经充分具备了转为高级社的条件。
    平顺县委虽然也认识到目前的任务是把初级社过渡为高级社，但是死搬了过去试办初级社的经验，认为试办时期应该少些，完全社会主义合作化还得几年。由于这种经验主义的思想在起指导作用，就不敢大胆放手指导运动前进。1955年冬天，平顺县委关于全县的完全社会主义合作化的规划，规定1956年全县只试办10个高级社，只包括全县7％的农户。这样，这个县的完全社会主义合作化的时间一直被推到1959年。可是这个规划宣布没有多久，要求转高级社的合作社就有220个。县委这才发现自己的规划是大大保守了，于是，立即采取了正确的作法，根据群众的要求来修正自己的规划，并展开了领导完全社会主义合作化的大规模的政治思想工作。
    县委认识到从初级社到高级社的转变是要取消全体社员对土地和主要生产资料的私有制，这是一场艰巨复杂的斗争，绝不能盲目乐观和草率从事，必须把工作作得更加细致些。于是县委对全县1万名左右的党员和团员进行了5天的短期训练，向他们着重讲解了党的完全社会主义合作化的方针和政策；同时，通过5年来合作化运动的总结，对所有党员和团员作了鉴定，分别对工作积极、工作消极和蜕化变质的党员和团员作了表扬、批评和处分。经过这次训练之后，党在完全社会主义合作化运动中就有了更加可靠的核心力量。
    接着，县委又组织了全县的60个报告员，1万名宣传员向全县11万群众展开了大规模的转高级社的宣传，其中有6万群众直接听到报告员的报告。经过宣传之后，原来积极要求办高级社的贫农和下中农更加欢欣鼓舞，信心百倍，原来对转高级社还有顾虑的富裕中农和老弱孤寡户也绝大部分顾虑解除，情绪安定。原来还没有提出转高级社的合作社，也在酝酿和申请转高级社了。运动迅速发展，群众的思想觉悟也迅速提高，在转入高级社的28，845户农户中，没有一户表示要退社的。
    再其次，县委为了取得建立高级社的经验，首先选择了9个社进行试办；试办以后，马上总结了经验，去指导全县大规模的完全社会主义合作化的运动。
    初级社在宣布转为高级社之后，完全社会主义制度的优越性立即显示出来。好多社今年的生产规划连续修正都不能满足社员增产的要求。广大社员的劳动积极性进一步提高了，城关高级社成立的第二天，就有42名妇女参加了劳动。估计，建立高级社以后社员劳动的利用率将要比过去提高40％到50％。群众形容这种空前的生产热潮说：“往年一九、二九是关门袖手，今年一九、二九是修滩垫沟”。根据广大群众在完全社会主义合作化以后更高的增产热情，根据可能挖掘的增产潜力，平顺县委已经修正了全县的生产规划，初步确定，要把粮食增产指标由原定的较1955年增产8.4％提高到36.7％。这种增产速度要是和前3年全县合作社增产速度比较的话，相当于1953年的五倍，相当于1954年的三点七倍，相当于大丰收的1955年的二点三倍。毫无疑问，紧接着完全社会主义合作化高潮之后，将是空前未有的生产高潮。
