　　Daye Iron Mine recently drafted a new plan, deciding to complete the basic mine construction project half a year ahead of schedule than originally planned, in order to supply the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise with the iron ore it needs in a timely manner.
    The main measures of the new plan are to expand mechanical construction and complete the construction of the electrical railway ahead of schedule. Starting in February this year, bulldozers will be used for construction in the Shizishan area, and heavy machinery such as power shovels will also be used in the fourth quarter. In this way, this year's project progress will be accelerated by more than 10% compared with the original plan. The construction of the electric railway should be based on the technical design to build the roadbed in advance, and at the same time, a segmented cross-construction method should be adopted, so that it can be guaranteed to complete 15 months of work in one year.

　　大冶铁矿决定提前半年完成矿山基本建设工程
    大冶铁矿最近拟订出一个新的规划方案，决定比原计划提前半年完成矿山基本建设工程，以便及时供应武汉钢铁联合企业需要的铁矿石。
    新方案的主要措施，是扩大机械施工、提前完成电气铁路的建设工程。从今年2月开始，狮子山区将用推土机施工，到第四季度也将用电铲等重型机械。这样，今年的工程进度将比原计划加快10％以上。电气铁路的建设，要依据技术设计提前修建路基，同时要采用分段交叉施工法，这样可以保证在一年内完成15个月的工作量。　（据新华社讯）
