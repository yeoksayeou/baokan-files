The supply and marketing cooperatives in Anhui, Yunnan, Hunan and other provinces are actively preparing and supplying spring ploughing production materials needed by farmers, according to the new situation of the great development of the agricultural cooperation movement.

The Anhui Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has now transferred a total of 15,200 new-style agricultural implements such as double-wheeled double-share plows, disc harrows, and seeders to various parts of the province, as well as more than 30 million catties of bone meal and chemical fertilizers, and a large number of insecticides, sprayers and other equipment.

The Yunnan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative will supply agricultural production cooperatives with more than 124,000 pieces of various new-style agricultural implements this year. In the first 10 days of January, nearly 4,000 double-wheeled double-share plows and a portion of chemical fertilizers have been successively transported to rural areas. At present, the grassroots organizations of supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties of Yunnan Province are extensively signing binding contracts with agricultural production cooperatives. In addition, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also formulated a plan to supply 10.8 million pieces of various small agricultural implements this year.

Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hunan Province are actively preparing fertilizers needed by farmers for spring ploughing. Supply and marketing cooperatives in counties in Xiangtan, Changde, Hengyang and other regions have organized local lime kilns to produce lime in large quantities. This year, supply and marketing cooperatives in Hunan Province plan to organize private lime kiln operators to produce 20 million dan of lime, which can meet the needs of approximately 20 million mu of paddy fields. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places also pay attention to collecting miscellaneous fertilizers. The Ningxiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has collected 17 kinds of miscellaneous tree seeds in the local area to trial-produce cake fertilizer.

    安徽、云南、湖南等省的供销合作社
    积极准备和供应春耕生产资料
    安徽、云南、湖南等省的供销合作社根据农业合作化运动大发展的新形势，正在积极准备和供应农民需要的春耕生产资料。
    安徽省供销合作社现在已经调往省内各地的双轮双铧犁、圆盘耙、播种机等新式农具，共有15，200部，另外还有3，000多万斤骨粉和化学肥料，以及大批杀虫药物、药械等。
    云南省供销合作社今年将供应农业生产合作社各种新式农具124，000多件。在1月份的前10天内，已经有近4，000部双轮双铧犁和一部分化学肥料陆续运往农村。目前，云南省各县供销合作社基层组织，正广泛地和农业生产合作社订立结合合同。此外，省供销合作社还制定了今年供应各种小农具1，080万件的计划。
    湖南省各地供销合作社积极为农民准备春耕所需要的肥料。湘潭、常德、衡阳等专区各县的供销合作社已经组织当地大批石灰窑生产石灰。今年湖南各地供销合作社计划组织私营石灰窑户生产石灰2，000万担，约可供2，000万亩稻田需要。各地供销合作社对收集杂肥也很注意。宁乡县供销合作社已经在当地搜集了17种杂树籽试制饼肥。
