To the Editor:

　　1956 is truly an exciting and encouraging year. Less than a month after the new year, "good news" keeps pouring in: At the beginning of January, under the guidance and encouragement of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperativization, our cooperative expanded from 156 households to 295 households, and transitioned from a primary cooperative to an advanced cooperative with a completely socialist nature. Following this, our capital city also entered socialism. Now, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have formulated the "National Agricultural Development Outline (Draft)" for 1956 to 1967, providing us with a concrete plan for realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture and a long-term goal for developing agricultural production, painting a picture of a prosperous and happy tomorrow for us.

　　Last December, we heard Chairman Mao's "Seventeen Points" instructions regarding agricultural development, and our confidence and determination in formulating this year's production plan were greatly strengthened compared to the past. Last year, we only planted 350 mu of cotton, with an average yield of 197.5 jin of seed cotton per mu, and a maximum yield of 330 jin. This year, we plan to plant 502 mu, with an average yield of 575 jin per mu, and aiming for 1,000 jin on 100 mu. This year, we will plant 250 mu of Baimaya corn, with an average yield of 650 jin per mu, and a maximum of 800 jin. We will plant 820 mu of yellow corn, with an average yield of 350 jin per mu, and a maximum of 500 jin. Last year, our cooperative only had 40 mu of paddy fields. This year, we plan to convert 160 mu of dry land into paddy fields through well-digging and canal construction. Last year, we only planted 60 mu of vegetables. This year, we plan to expand it to 139 mu, and the yield will also be increased from 8,000 jin per mu last year to 12,800 jin. There are more than 500 mu of low-lying land on the east side of the cooperative. We plan to dig several drainage ditches to turn it all into fertile paddy fields within three years.

　　Although some items in this production increase plan have greatly exceeded the targets proposed in the "Outline," we are fully confident in completing it. We plan to work hard in terms of selecting good seeds, applying more fertilizer, deep plowing and close planting, and strengthening field management. In order to meet the requirement of applying an average of 5,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, we started winter manure accumulation work in October last year, and have already accumulated more than 8 million jin of fertilizer.

　　A few days ago, we visited the agricultural exhibition held by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy, and saw various agricultural machines and production targets for the seven-year perspective and the five-year plan. We felt that although our cooperative's production is increasing year by year, we still need to work harder to meet the requirements of the long-term plan. Seeing the 40-article outline for agricultural development, our enthusiasm is even greater. We must strive to complete and overfulfill this year's agricultural production increase plan.

### 完成增产计划的劲头更大了

    完成增产计划的劲头更大了编辑同志：
    1956年真是令人欢欣鼓舞的一年。过了年不到一个月，“喜事”就接连不断：1月初，我们社在党中央和毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示和鼓舞下，由156户发展成了295户，并且由初级社转成了完全社会主义性质的高级社。接着我们的首都又进入了社会主义。现在毛主席和党中央订出了1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案），给我们指出了实现农业社会主义改造的具体计划和发展农业生产的长期奋斗目标，给我们描出了一幅繁荣幸福的明天的图画。
    去年12月份，我们听到了毛主席关于农业发展方面的“十七条”指示，在制定今年生产计划的时候，信心和决心就比过去大大的加强了。去年我们只种了350亩棉花，每亩平均产籽棉197.5斤，最高产330斤；今年我们准备种502亩，平均每亩产575斤，其中100亩要求达到1，000斤。今年种白马牙玉米250亩，每亩平均产650斤，最高的达到800斤。种820亩黄玉米，每亩平均产350斤，最高达到500斤。去年我社只有40亩稻田，今年计划用打井、挖渠的办法，把160亩旱地改成稻田。去年我们只种了60亩蔬菜，今年，准备扩大为139亩，产量也要由去年的每亩8，000斤提高为12，800斤。社里东边有500多亩洼地，我们准备开几道排水渠，在3年之内把它全部变成肥沃的稻田。
    这个增产计划，虽然有些项目已经大大超过了“纲要”上所提出的指标，但是我们完全有信心去完成它。我们准备从选用良种，增施肥料，深耕密植，加强田间管理等方面去努力。为了能够达到每亩平均施肥5，000斤的要求，我们从去年10月就开始了冬季积肥工作，现在已经积了800多万斤肥料。
    前些日子我们参观了北京市农林水利局举办的农业展览会，看到了各种农业机器和七年远景，五年计划的生产指标。我们感到我们社的生产虽然一年比一年提高，但是要达到远景计划的要求，还需要加劲干。看到了农业发展的40条纲要，我们劲头更大了，我们一定要努力完成并超额完成今年的农业增产计划。  北京市南苑区大红门乡农业生产合作社
