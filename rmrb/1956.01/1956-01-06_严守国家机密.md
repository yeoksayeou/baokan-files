　　Strictly Guard State Secrets
　　Liu Enqi

In the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries across the country, numerous serious incidents of espionage, spying, and counter-revolutionary elements stealing state secrets have been uncovered. These incidents remind us that we must instill a sense of confidentiality among all the people of the country, especially among all personnel in Party and government organs, people's organizations, schools, and enterprises, and strictly guard state secrets.

Domestic and foreign enemies, in order to undermine our country, are constantly using various means to probe and steal our country's various secrets. For example, in order to find out and destroy our country's national defense strength and provide a basis for the US imperialists to formulate plans for aggressive wars, special agents and spies sent by the US and Chiang Kai-shek's secret service agencies to our mainland tried every possible means to steal our military secrets. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's secret service organization instructed the special agents lurking in our mainland: "Please direct all activities towards military aspects." For another example, since our economic construction is not only related to the socialist future of our country but also determines the growth of our national defense forces, the enemy has exhausted all means to steal important intelligence on our country's industrial production, international trade, and material reserves. The US and Chiang Kai-shek's secret service agencies once instructed their special agents and spies to obtain this intelligence at all costs, "Even a little bit is valuable..." The enemy has never relaxed its efforts to obtain political and cultural secrets that are very important to our country and people.

Our people have a fine tradition of keeping secrets. But this does not mean that there are no people who are politically paralyzed and careless and leak state secrets. On the contrary, after the victory of the revolutionary war, especially after our country entered into large-scale economic construction, some people thought that the world was already peaceful, and that confidentiality work seemed dispensable; or they regarded confidentiality work as very narrow, thinking that it was only a matter for a few leading staff and confidential staff, and had nothing to do with themselves. It is precisely this paralyzing thought and careless attitude that has opened the door to the activities of hidden enemies to steal state secrets.

There are many forms of leaking state secrets. One is to violate the system of printing, distributing, keeping, and reading confidential documents. For example, there is no strict control and supervision in the process of drafting, proofreading, copying, and printing telegrams, documents, and materials related to state secrets; the names, page numbers, and number of pieces are not carefully registered when receiving, sending, and transmitting, or they are not registered at all; the scope of reading is arbitrarily expanded; individuals borrow documents and do not return them after the expiration date; the archives are not strictly kept; the system of handing over and destroying documents is not strictly enforced; there is a lack of necessary equipment for keeping documents, etc. This will make it impossible for us to detect and track down after our documents are lost or stolen by the enemy. In terms of personal safekeeping of documents, some people do not lock the drawers where confidential documents are stored, take confidential documents home, record confidential matters in personal notebooks, read confidential documents in public places, and lose documents in public places when traveling on official business. These loopholes caused by carelessness will also make it easy for the enemy to obtain the intelligence they need. Here is an example. A counter-revolutionary element who infiltrated the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau obtained a large amount of confidential intelligence from the bureau director. It turned out that the director's drawer was often not locked, and the notebook with confidential materials was placed together with ordinary books and magazines, and he did not tidy up the documents when he left the office. The counter-revolutionary element seized these opportunities, and used the time when he was on night shift to browse various confidential documents and notebooks, and stole these secrets.

There are also many cases of verbal leakage of state secrets. The enemy knows that intelligence that often takes a long time and complex and risky methods to obtain, or even cannot be obtained, can sometimes be obtained effortlessly from the mouths of those who like to brag. People who like to brag and love "small broadcasts" talk about state secrets not only in front of relatives and friends, lovers, but also in public places such as trains, cinemas, and barber shops, to show off themselves. Some people also talk about state secrets on the phone and when giving reports. They not only "talk," but also quote confidential materials in private correspondence, in articles published in newspapers and books, and in exhibits. It is not an exaggeration to call these people the enemy's "volunteer intelligence officers"!

Equally, it cannot be ignored that a small number of people in the revolutionary ranks cannot withstand the enemy's corruption and enticement, and have embarked on the criminal road of directly informing the enemy. The US intelligence agency once instructed its spies to "establish friendly relations with such people that are not easily detected, and give them money at the appropriate time to make them their debtors... get people drunk with wine and make them tell the truth." In fact, in order to achieve the purpose of stealing intelligence, the enemy not only uses "money" and "wine," but also uses the despicable "honey trap." Wang Xueyu, a female secret agent who sneaked into Tianjin from Hong Kong, used "making boyfriends" and "dating" and other pornographic means to lure certain doctors, engineers, teachers and cadres into her trap. Her tentacles extended from hospitals and schools to enterprises and institutions, and through her "agents" she easily obtained all kinds of intelligence.

Keeping state secrets is a major issue related to the security of the country and the well-being of the people. Vigilantly guarding state secrets is to prove one's loyalty to the motherland and the people in practical actions, which is to defend our motherland and defend the peaceful and happy life of our people.

Confidentiality work is a matter of fighting the enemy. In order to do this work effectively, the state's laws on confidentiality must be implemented. The "Provisional Regulations on Guarding State Secrets" promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on June 8, 1951, clearly stipulates the methods of rewards and punishments according to the different circumstances of losing and leaking secrets. However, in the past, the leading cadres of some units were not serious about the investigation and handling of incidents of losing and leaking secrets because they themselves lacked a sense of enemy and confidentiality, and they rarely considered from a political perspective whether it was a deliberate theft by hidden enemies in the case of major secret losses; they were even less likely to conduct serious handling of the loss and leakage of secrets caused by liberalism and carelessness among the staff. In this way, the development of the trend of losing and leaking secrets was objectively promoted, thus facilitating the activities of counter-revolutionary elements to steal secrets.

After the start of this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, some units attached importance to the investigation of incidents of losing and leaking secrets, and organized staff to hold discussions to study the causes of losing and leaking secrets, find ways to prevent them, and formulate mass confidentiality covenants against spies, so that long-unresolved incidents of losing secrets came to a conclusion, and counter-revolutionary elements who stole secrets were found out and punished according to law. The persons responsible for causing incidents of losing and leaking secrets by the staff were appropriately dealt with according to the circumstances (including criticism, administrative sanctions, and legal sanctions). As a result, the organization was purified, the political vigilance of the staff was improved, and the loopholes in losing and leaking secrets were blocked.

Keeping state secrets is the duty of all the people. The occurrence of phenomena of losing and leaking secrets is not only due to the intentional theft by counter-revolutionary elements, but also due to the paralysis, carelessness and negligence of some state organ staff and the people. Therefore, in addition to strictly enforcing the state's laws, strengthening confidentiality work must also conduct regular confidentiality education for cadres and the masses, and further establish and improve various confidentiality systems and personnel systems. In addition, we should also regularly conduct serious inspections of the confidentiality of confidential documents and key departments, summarize experiences and lessons, and educate staff so that state secrets can be ensured to be safe.

　　严守国家机密
    刘恩启
    全国各地在肃清反革命分子的斗争中，揭发出不少特务、间谍、反革命分子盗窃国家机密的严重事件。这些事件提醒我们，必须在全国人民中间，首先是在党政机关、人民团体、学校、企业等全体人员中间，树立保密观念，严格地保守国家机密。
    国内外敌人为了破坏我们的国家，时时刻刻使用各种手段，刺探和窃取我们国家的各种机密。比如，为了探知和破坏我国的国防实力，给美帝国主义制定侵略战争计划提供根据，美国和蒋贼特务机关派到我国大陆来的特务、间谍分子，就千方百计地窃取我国军事机密。最近蒋贼特务组织就曾指示在我国大陆潜伏的特务说：“一切活动请指向军事方面。”又如，由于我国经济建设不仅关系着我们国家的社会主义前途，而且决定着我国国防力量的增长，所以敌人就用尽一切办法窃取我国工业生产、国际贸易、物资储备等重要情报。美国和蒋贼特务机关曾经指示它的特务、间谍分子要不惜一切取得这些情报，“那怕是一点点，都是可贵的……”。对我们国家和人民十分重要的政治和文化机密，敌人也从来没有放松过。
    我国人民具有保守机密的优良传统。但这并不是说就没有政治上麻痹大意和泄露国家机密的人了。相反的，革命战争胜利以后特别是我国转入大规模经济建设以后，有一部分人以为天下已经太平，保密工作似乎可有可无了；或者他们把保密工作看得很狭隘，认为这只是少数领导工作人员和机要工作人员的事，和自己无关。正是这种麻痹思想和漫不经心的态度，给暗藏敌人盗窃国家机密的活动开了方便之门。
    泄露国家机密的形式是多种多样的。一种是违反印发保管和阅读机密文件的制度。比如对有关国家机密的电报、文件和资料，在拟制、缮校、复制、印刷过程中没有严格的控制和监督；在收发、传递的时候不认真登记名称、页数、件数或根本不登记；随意扩大阅读范围；个人借阅文件过期不还；档案保管不严密；对上缴、销毁文件的制度执行得不严格；缺乏保管文件的必要设备，等等。这就会使我们在文件遗失或者被敌人窃取以后，也无从察觉和难以追查。在个人保管文件方面，有些人存放机密文件的抽屉不锁，把机密文件带回家去，在个人的记事本上记载机密事项，在公共场所阅读机密文件，因公外出的时候把文件丢失在公共场所。由于漫不经心而产生的这些漏洞，同样会使敌人很容易地得到他们所需要的情报。这里有一个例子。一个混入天津电业局的反革命分子，从局长那里得到了大批机密情报。原来局长的抽屉经常不锁，记有机密材料的笔记本同普通的书籍、杂志放在一起，离开办公室的时候也不把文件收拾好。反革命分子瞅准了这些机会，就利用值夜班的时间翻阅了各种机要文件和笔记本，并且把这些机密盗窃了去。
    口头上泄露国家机密的情况也是不少的。敌人知道，往往在长时间内用复杂、冒险的方法才能得到甚至不能得到的情报，有时候会毫不费力地从我们那些喜欢吹牛的人的嘴里得到。喜欢吹牛、爱好“小广播”的人，不但在亲友面前、爱人面前而且在火车上、影戏院、理发馆等公共场所谈论国家机密，炫耀自己。有人在电话上、在作报告的时候也谈论国家机密。他们不但“讲”，而且在私人通信中、在报纸书刊发表的文章中和展览品中，援引机密材料。这些人，要是把他们叫做敌人的“义务情报员”，是一点也不过火的！
    同样不能忽视的是：革命队伍中有一小部分人，经不起敌人的腐蚀勾引，走上了直接向敌人告密的犯罪道路。美国特务机关曾经指示它的间谍分子“去同这样的人建立不易被人察觉的友好关系，并在适当时候给他金钱，使他们成为自己的债户……把人用酒灌醉，叫他们吐出真情”。事实上，敌人为了达到盗窃情报的目的，不但用“金钱”和“酒”，而且还用卑鄙的“美人计”。从香港潜入天津市的女特务王学瑜，就使用“交男朋友”、“谈恋爱”等色情手段，引诱某些医生、工程师、教员和干部上了她的圈套，她的触角就从医院、学校伸展到企业和机关内部，通过她的“代理人”很容易地弄到了各种各样的情报。
    保守国家机密是关系国家安危、关系人民祸福的一个重大问题。警惕地保守国家机密，这就是在实际行动中证明自己对祖国、对人民的忠诚，这就是在保卫我们的祖国，保卫我国人民的和平幸福生活。
    保密工作是一个对敌斗争的问题。为了切实做好这一工作，必须贯彻执行国家关于保密的法律。1951年6月8日中央人民政府政务院颁布的“保守国家机密暂行条例”，根据失密、泄密的不同情况，明确规定了奖惩办法。但是，过去有些单位的领导干部因为本身缺乏敌情观念和保密观念，对于失密、泄密事件的追查处理很不认真，对于重大失密事件，很少从政治上考虑会不会是暗藏敌人的有意窃取；对于工作人员中因为自由主义、粗枝大叶所造成的遗失和泄露机密事件，就更少进行严肃的处理。这样就在客观上助长了失密泄密风气的发展，因而也就便利了反革命分子盗窃机密的活动。
    这次肃清反革命分子的斗争开始以后，有些单位重视了对失密、泄密事件的追查工作，并且组织工作人员座谈讨论，研究失密、泄密的原因，寻找防止的办法，订出了群众性的防奸保密公约，使长期没有查清的失密事件得出了结论，查出和依法惩办了盗窃机密的反革命分子。对工作人员造成失密、泄密事件的责任者分别情节作了适当的处理（包括批评、行政处分和法律制裁）。这样做的结果，就纯洁了组织，提高了工作人员的政治警惕性，堵塞了失密、泄密的漏洞。
    保守国家机密是全体人民的义务。失密泄密现象的发生，不只是因为反革命分子的有意窃取，也因为有些国家机关工作人员和人民群众的麻痹大意和疏忽。所以，加强保密工作，除了严格执行国家的法律以外，还必须对干部和群众进行经常的保密教育，必须进一步建立和健全各种保密制度和用人制度。此外，还应该经常对机要文件和要害部门的保密情况进行认真的检查，总结经验教训，教育工作人员，使国家机密能够确保无失。
