    Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: As the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce has now entered a new stage of overall public-private partnership, trade union organizations at all levels should strengthen the political and ideological education of the broad masses of workers and staff. At the same time, all trade union organizations in private and joint state-private enterprises must take mobilizing workers to increase production as a regular central task. This was pointed out by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The meeting discussed the issue of strengthening trade union work in the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.
    The meeting pointed out that before enterprises implement joint state-private ownership, trade unions must mobilize the masses to persistently carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and ensure the completion of the state's processing, ordering, and sales agency tasks. In the process of implementing joint state-private ownership, in addition to mobilizing the masses to participate in inventory checks and asset verification, trade unions should also pay close attention to production work and avoid affecting current production due to the intense work of joint state-private ownership. After the implementation of joint state-private ownership, trade unions should further mobilize the masses to carry out socialist emulation, increase production, and improve the enterprise's operation and management.
    The meeting also pointed out that the organizational form of trade unions should be adjusted accordingly. For example, after the originally scattered private enterprises implement overall public-private ownership, trade union organizations in various industries should be established according to the administrative organization system of various industries after public-private ownership, and gradually change the past form of district-based comprehensive leadership.

    要求各级工会加强私营企业工会工作
    新华社13日讯  当目前对私营工商业的社会主义改造已经进入全行业公私合营的新的阶段，工会各级组织应该加强对广大职工的政治思想教育工作；同时，一切私营和公私合营企业中的工会组织，都必须把发动职工提高生产作为经常的中心任务。这是中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会第四次全体会议所指出的。这次会议曾讨论了加强私营工商业社会主义改造中的工会工作问题。
    这次会议指出，企业在实行公私合营以前，工会必须发动群众坚持开展增产节约运动，保证完成国家的加工订货和经销代销任务。在实行公私合营的过程中，工会除了发动群众参加清产核资等工作外，还应当十分注意生产工作，不要因为紧张的公私合营工作而影响当前生产。公私合营以后，工会应该进一步发动群众开展社会主义竞赛，提高生产，改善企业的经营管理。
    会议还指出，工会的组织形式应有相应的调整。如原来分散的私营企业在实行全行业公私合营以后，就应该按照各行业公私合营后的行政组织系统建立各行业的工会组织，逐步改变过去分区综合领导的形式。
