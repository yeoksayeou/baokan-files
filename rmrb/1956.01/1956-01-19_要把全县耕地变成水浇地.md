    Transforming All County Farmland into Irrigated Land
    Zhao Zuowei
    Wen County, Henan Province, is bounded by the Yellow River to the south and the Qin River to the north, with 25 small rivers running diagonally through the middle. This plain area, rich in rivers and abundant underground water sources, has the potential to transform most of the county's farmland into irrigated land. However, before liberation, farmers needed to save for over a decade to dig a brick well, and the earthen wells collapsed every year. People often suffered from waterlogging and drought disasters and could not live and produce in peace. At the time of liberation, there were only over 8,000 wells, and most of them were dilapidated. Of the county's more than 450,000 mu of farmland, only 75,000 mu were irrigated. The highest yield of the main crop, wheat, was only about 150 jin per mu; the autumn crops were also limited due to the local drought followed by waterlogging. The area frequently flooded in the county was 77,000 mu. During rainy seasons, people would recklessly breach dikes and discharge water, and villages often engaged in械斗 (armed fights) due to drainage disputes.
    After liberation, the Party and the government relied on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to mobilize the masses to vigorously develop farmland water conservancy. In the past few years (including 1955), the county has dug and repaired a total of 17,027 wells, promoted 5,714 waterwheels, and renovated many canals. As a result, the irrigated area has expanded to more than 265,000 mu, more than doubling the area before liberation. At the same time, by adopting methods such as repairing river courses, widening and deepening them, the frequently flooded farmland in the county has been reduced from 77,000 mu to 25,000 mu. Farmland water conservancy has played a significant role in ensuring increased agricultural production. In 1954, the county's total grain output had increased by 24.4% compared to 1949. In 1955, the county's total grain output reached 111,021,319 jin, and the yield per unit area was 187 jin and 6 liang, an increase of 44% compared to 1949.
    How was the mass farmland water conservancy work in Wen County carried out?
    In 1952, when the county Party committee discussed the issue of increasing agricultural production, it clearly recognized that to achieve increased production in Wen County, it was first necessary to focus on water conservancy. Based on the actual situation, the county Party committee divided the county into three types of areas: one was the waterlogged area, where the main task was drainage; one was the well-suited area, where the main task was to dig wells and find springs; and the other was the Yellow River滩 (beach/sandy area), where the main task was to fight drought and protect seedlings. The county Party committee first conducted a water conservancy development experiment in Mazhuang Village. In 1952, this village expanded its double-cropping area by 50% due to the development of water conservancy. In that year, the county had a total of 5,000 mu of irrigated wheat fields, which also increased production. This fact made rural workers initially realize the benefits of farmland water conservancy. In the spring of 1953, wheat suffered from severe frost damage, and more than 200,000 mu of the county's 310,000 mu of wheat were affected. At that time, the masses saw that the wheat after the frost had no hope, and they were afraid of losing both seasons, so they wanted to plow the wheat and plant autumn crops. In order to save the loss of wheat after the frost, the county Party committee experimented with watering wheat after frost in Mazhuang Village, and the result was effective; they immediately organized visits and mobilized farmers throughout the county to use all water tools (the government also newly loaned more than 2,300 waterwheels) to launch a watering wheat campaign. In that year, 90% of the wheat in Zhang Danqing's mutual aid group in Mazhuang Village was watered and fertilized, resulting in significant production increases. Zhang Danqing's one mu of high-yield land (irrigated land) yielded 916 jin of wheat. These facts made many farmers and cadres realize the great benefits of developing farmland water conservancy. In that year, due to mobilizing the masses to dig wells and buy waterwheels to launch a watering wheat campaign, wheat suffered less loss, and the county still achieved 80% of the harvest, and 37 high-yield villages and 46 high-yield groups emerged.
    In November 1954, the county Party committee convened a water conservancy conference, proposing the task of vigorously developing farmland water conservancy. However, at that time, some farmers also said: "Relying on the sky, there is no rain; waiting for the river, there is no water; digging earthen wells is a sandy bottom; digging brick wells is unaffordable; drought-resistant planting is always laborious!" The county Party committee then educated all cadres to go deep into the production process and use examples of increased production through water conservancy development to carry out propaganda and education to the masses, break through the masses' ideological concerns, and increase everyone's confidence in building water conservancy and increasing production. On this basis, the masses were mobilized to form well-digging teams and watering groups to dig and use wells together; and through visits and learning, technicians going to the countryside, and short-term training, the technology was taught to the masses. In order to overcome the difficulties of "digging brick wells costs a lot of money, and digging earthen wells collapses every year," the county People's Committee sent 3 people to Xuchang County to learn the technology of digging bamboo wells and experimented in Mazhuang Village after returning. After the experiment was successful, 224 staff members from the county, district, township, and agricultural production cooperatives were organized to observe. In this way, some people's conservative idea that bamboo poles could not dig wells was also broken. In order to strongly support cooperatives and mutual aid groups in digging bamboo wells and promptly solve problems such as funding, raw material supply, and waterwheel repair, the county Party committee also convened "Four Societies Conference" of agricultural cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and handicraft cooperatives by district, formulated well-digging plans and material supply plans, combined the activities of various departments, and made them work together towards the goal of developing farmland water conservancy and increasing agricultural production.
    Under the leadership of the Party branch, each township divided the well-digging areas, revised the well-digging plans, and investigated how many wells were lacking in the whole village, how many water tools were lacking, how many people could dig wells, when they could be completed, how much land could be irrigated after the well-digging task was completed, and how much production could be increased. Each township also stipulated how much remuneration would be given to the cooperatives for digging a well in the future, in accordance with the mutual benefit policy. In this way, the masses actively took action. Soon, 150 people in the county learned the technology of digging bamboo wells. Under the leadership of the cooperative, the farmers in Zhengmenzhuang Village dug 280 wells. Their slogan was: "Every well has water, every plot is irrigated!" The first agricultural cooperative in Weigou Village originally wanted to dig two new brick wells, but because of financial difficulties, they did not plan to dig them. Later, the district committee helped them overcome the difficulties of digging bamboo wells. The success of this cooperative in digging bamboo wells promoted the bamboo well-digging movement in the whole district.
    The vivid facts of cooperatives developing water conservancy and increasing production educated the wavering farmers. The households who originally asked to withdraw from the cooperatives no longer mentioned withdrawing from the cooperatives, and the individual households who wanted to compete with the cooperatives also asked to join the cooperatives. In the spring of 1955, there were two well-to-do middle peasants in Zhengmenzhuang who had never participated in mutual aid groups in the past, and their average yield per mu was 60 jin higher than that of ordinary farmers; however, in 1955, the yield per mu of the cooperative was 20 jin higher than their yield. They felt that individual farming was no longer working and also asked to join the cooperative. Before the autumn of 1955, there were a total of 610 agricultural cooperatives in the county, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounted for 36.4% of the total number of peasant households; after the autumn, the number of cooperatives rapidly increased to 1,061, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounted for 86% of the total number of peasant households; in the recent upsurge of cooperation, these primary cooperatives rapidly merged and transformed into 577 advanced cooperatives, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounted for 99% of the total number of peasant households. That is to say, the county has achieved complete socialist cooperation.
    In the autumn of 1955, there were still more than 200,000 mu of irrigable land in Wen County that had not been developed for water conservancy. In order to transform all the county's farmland into irrigated land, under the leadership of the county Party committee, each township formulated farmland water conservancy plans based on the cooperative planning and production planning. The result of the county's planning was: starting in 1956, more than 8,100 wells will be dug, and dry land will be eliminated by 1957. In the upsurge of cooperation, the county launched a large-scale well-digging movement in winter. The peasants overcame the cold, defeated the freezing, and their labor enthusiasm was extremely high. In the last two months of last year, 826 brick wells, 267 grey wells, and 6 bamboo wells were dug. Judging from the current situation, the plan can be realized ahead of schedule.

    要把全县耕地变成水浇地
    赵作为
    河南省温县南濒黄河，北临沁水，中间斜贯25条小河流。这个多河的平原地带，地下水源充溢，全县大多数耕地都可能变成水浇地。但是在解放前，农民要想打一眼砖井，需要积蓄10几年，打土井又年年塌，人民常受水旱灾害，不能安居生产。到解放的时候，仅有水井8，000多眼，而且大部塌毁。全县45万多亩耕地中，仅有75，000亩水浇地。全县主要作物小麦每亩最高产量只有150斤左右；大秋作物也因当地先旱后涝，收成很有限。全县经常受淹的面积有77，000亩。每到多雨时期，乱扒堤，乱排水，村和村之间常常因为排水纠纷而发生械斗。
    解放后，党和政府依靠互助合作组织，发动群众大力开展了农田水利工作。几年来（包括1955年）全县共打井修井17，027眼，推广水车5，714部，整修了许多渠道。因此，水浇地已经扩大到265，000多亩，比解放前扩大了二倍多。同时，采取了整修河道、开宽挖深等办法，全县经常受淹的农田，已经由77，000亩减少到25，000亩。农田水利在保证农业增产方面起了重大作用。1954年全县粮食产量已经比1949年增加24.4％。1955年全县粮食总产量达到111，021，319斤，单位面积产量是187斤6两，比1949年增加44％。
    温县的群众性农田水利工作，是怎样开展起来的呢？
    1952年县委讨论农业增产问题的时候明确地认识了：温县要做到增产，首先必须抓住水利。县委根据实际情况把全县分为三种地区：一种是涝洼地区，主要任务是排涝；一种是宜井地区，主要是打井下泉；再一种是黄河滩，主要是抗旱保苗。县委首先在马庄村进行发展水利的试验。1952年这个村由于发展了水利，复种面积扩大了50％。这一年全县共有小麦水浇地5，000亩，也都增加了生产。这个事实，使农村工作人员初步认识到了农田水利的好处。1953年春天，小麦遭受了严重的霜灾，全县31万亩小麦，受灾的达20多万亩。当时群众看到霜后的小麦没有希望，怕两季都落空，要犁了麦子种秋季作物。县委为了挽救霜后小麦的损失，在马庄村试验霜后小麦浇水办法，结果有效；他们马上组织参观，发动全县农民利用一切水具（政府并新贷水车2，300多部），展开浇麦运动。这一年马庄村张丹青互助组的小麦有90％浇过水，并且增施了肥料，因此获得了显著的增产成绩。张丹青的一亩丰产地（水浇地），收小麦916斤。这些事实使许多农民和干部认识了发展农田水利的巨大好处。这一年，由于发动群众打井买水车，展开浇小麦运动，使小麦少受了损失，全县仍然得到八成收成，并出现了37个丰产村、46个丰产组。
    1954年11月县委召开了水利会议，提出大力开展农田水利工作的任务。但是当时有的农民也说：“靠天没雨，等河缺水，打土井是沙底，打砖井负担不起，抗旱点种老费力！”县委便教育所有的干部深入生产过程，用发展水利得到增产的实例，向群众进行宣传教育，打破群众的思想顾虑，使大家增加了兴修水利、增加生产的信心。在这个基础上发动群众成立打井队、浇地组，伙打伙用水井；并且通过参观学习、技术人员下乡和短期训练等方法，把技术教给群众。为了克服“打砖井花钱多、打土井又年年塌”的困难，县人民委员会派3个人到许昌县学习了打竹井的技术，回来在马庄村试验。试验成功后，组织县、区、乡和农业生产合作社的224个工作人员观摩。这样，某些人的认为竹竿打不成井的保守思想也打破了。为了有力地支援合作社和互助组打竹井，及时解决资金、原料供应以及水车修配等问题，县委又分区召开了农业合作社、供销合作社、信用合作社、手工业合作社的“四社会议”，制定打井计划和物资供应计划，把各部门的活动结合起来，使它们向着发展农田水利事业、增加农业生产的目标一齐努力。
    各乡在党支部的领导下，划分打井区，修订打井计划，调查了全村缺多少井，缺多少水具，有多少会打井的人，能在什么时候完成，完成了打井任务能浇多少地，能增产多少。各乡又按照互利政策，规定打一眼井将来入社给多少报酬。这样，群众就积极行动了起来。全县很快就有150人学会了打竹井技术。郑门庄村的农民在合作社的带动下，打井280眼。他们的口号是：“井井有水，块块都浇！”卫沟村第一农业合作社本想打两眼新砖井，可是因为资金困难，就不计划打了。后来区委帮助他们克服了打竹井的困难。这个社打竹井成功的事实，推动了全区的打竹井运动。
    合作社发展水利得到增产的活生生的事实，教育了动摇不定的农民，原来要求退社的户再不提退社的事了，想和合作社比一比的单干户也要求入社。1955年春季，郑门庄有两个富裕中农，过去是互助组也不参加的，他们的每亩平均产量比一般农民高出60斤；可是1955年合作社的每亩产量高出他们的产量20斤。他们感到单干不中了，也要求入社了。1955年秋前全县共有610个农业合作社，入社农户占总农户的36.4％；秋后合作社迅速增加到1，061个，入社农户占总农户的86％；在最近的合作化高潮中，这些初级合作社迅速合并转为577个高级社，入社农户占总农户的99％。这就是说，全县已经实现了完全社会主义的合作化。
    1955年秋季温县还有20多万亩可以灌溉的土地没有兴修水利。为了把全县耕地变为水浇地，在县委的领导下，各乡根据合作化规划和生产规划，作出了农田水利规划。全县规划的结果是：从1956年开始，再打井8，100多眼，到1957年消灭旱田。在合作化的高潮中，全县在冬季展开了大规模的打井运动，农民们冲破寒冷，战胜冰冻，劳动热情极其高涨。在去年最后两个月当中，就打成砖井826眼、灰井267眼、竹井6眼。从目前的情况看，规划可以提前实现。
