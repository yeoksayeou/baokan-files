Chairman Li Jishen, fellow members:

I am entrusted by the Standing Committee to present the work report to the Second Plenary Session of the Second National Committee.
		I
In the past year, the Standing Committee has carried out the following tasks in accordance with the seven guidelines of the General Program of the Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions on the five tasks of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:

    (1) Political Consultation. Since the closing of the First Plenary Session, the Standing Committee has held 14 meetings to discuss and consult on major national and international issues. Regarding the issue of private industrial and commercial enterprises, the Standing Committee organized CPPCC members from the industrial and commercial sectors to hold forums to discuss the guiding principles and policies related to adjusting the public-private relationship of industrial and commercial enterprises. Regarding the issue of agricultural cooperativization, the Standing Committee organized members in Beijing and deputies to the National People's Congress in Beijing to discuss the Model Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives (Draft) proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and recently organized some members in Beijing to participate in a forum discussing the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967 proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and provided opinions on revisions and supplements to the articles of these two documents. At the tenth meeting of the Standing Committee, the issue of senior intellectuals was discussed, which aroused more attention from all parties on this issue. The Standing Committee has also conducted consultations and discussions on major issues such as the "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Draft)," the issuance of new Renminbi, the simplification and reform of Chinese characters, and the implementation of fixed interest rates and property inventory valuation in joint public-private enterprises. In terms of international issues, the Standing Committee has listened to reports from Chairman Zhou Enlai and held discussions on issues such as China's participation in the Asian-African Conference, the signing of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, and other major international issues.
      (2) Work on International Activities. In order to implement the resolution of the World Peace Council on opposing the use of atomic weapons, the Standing Committee, in conjunction with the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, launched a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, with more than 400 million people signing. On the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the Standing Committee, in conjunction with the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, held a grand meeting to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, expressing the deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. During the visits to China by Mr. Nenni, Secretary-General of the Italian Socialist Party, and Mr. Tetsu Katayama, head of the Japanese National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, the Standing Committee invited them to give lectures. In addition, the Standing Committee also carried out international friendly activities and peace movement through other various forms.
      (3) Work of Various Working Groups. The association has established eight groups including international issues, industry and commerce, culture, education, science and technology, social welfare, overseas Chinese, and religion. Among the members in Beijing, 184 people voluntarily signed up to participate in various groups, and in addition, 80 people from relevant parties were invited to participate in various groups. The groups carried out their activities according to the needs of national political life and the united front work in various periods, and held a total of 41 forums and 12 report meetings. On important issues such as the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, the exchange of experiences between Chinese and Western medicine, issues related to religious circles and ethnic minorities, higher education, and cultural aspects of the First Five-Year Plan, forums or reports were held. In terms of international issues, in addition to studying and discussing important issues, reports were also given on visits to Burma and reports from the Chinese Islamic Hajj delegation. In addition, some working groups also organized small-scale visits.
      (4) Work on Organizing Learning. The Learning Committee of the Association organized various studies on Marxist-Leninist theory and national policies on a voluntary basis. In the past year, in addition to studying the relevant documents of the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, the main focus was on studying modern Chinese history and studying the policy on eliminating counter-revolutionaries. The purpose of studying modern Chinese history is to master the knowledge of historical materialism, criticize bourgeois idealism, and thereby understand the laws of historical development in China. From February of last year, the Learning Committee held a lecture series on modern Chinese history, inviting people with research on modern history to give reports and conduct group discussions. During this period, some people were also organized to participate in the report meeting on promoting materialism and criticizing bourgeois idealism sponsored by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. After the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was exposed, the Learning Committee held an expanded forum in conjunction with the Cultural Group. At the meeting, they unanimously condemned the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and suggested that all democratic parties, democrats, and people's organizations should be vigilant and assist state organs in eliminating all hidden counter-revolutionaries. Subsequently, the Learning Committee organized a study forum on the policy of eliminating all hidden counter-revolutionaries.
    The spare-time political schools for cadres of democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, which are run by this association, have more than 430 students, who have completed the history of the Chinese revolution and the basics of Marxism-Leninism, and are now studying dialectical materialism and historical materialism. After the cadres of the democratic parties participated in the spare-time political schools, their theoretical knowledge, political level, and work attitude have been continuously improved. Experience has proved that it is an effective way to conduct systematic theoretical education for on-the-job cadres by running spare-time political schools.
      (5) Work on Inspection. In November 1955, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of this association jointly decided to organize members of this association to inspect rural and urban work with representatives of the National People's Congress. The members of this association also specially inspected the work of the provincial and municipal committees of the CPPCC, and investigated the issues related to senior intellectuals.
		II
Now report on the work of local committees. According to existing statistics, 358 local committees have been established, of which 52 belong to provinces, autonomous regions, and cities with a population of more than 500,000, and 306 belong to counties (cities) and urban areas. There are currently two to three hundred county (city)-level local committees that are planned to be established successively. The constituent units and the number of members of local committees at all levels have increased significantly compared with the original consultative bodies. The first plenary sessions of local committees at all levels were generally well-held, further clarifying the tasks and roles of the CPPCC in China's transition period, thereby enhancing unity and improving understanding. This has had a good effect on local political consultative work.

    The work of provincial and municipal local committees has generally improved compared to the past. The Standing Committee holds meetings regularly and has carried out various routine tasks to varying degrees. In terms of political consultation, consultations have been carried out on some important policy measures and major issues, such as the unified purchase and sale of grain, agricultural cooperativization, and the elimination of counter-revolutionaries. Some provincial and municipal committees have also focused on consulting and dealing with issues related to the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Many provincial and municipal committees have consulted and discussed various related lists and draft laws, decrees, and regulations submitted by state organs for soliciting opinions. In terms of closely contacting the masses and reflecting opinions, some provincial and municipal committees have maintained regular contact with members through methods such as communication and individual visits; some have also adopted the method of joint meetings of secretaries-general of democratic parties and people's organizations to closely contact various democratic parties and people's organizations; and have collected the opinions of the masses through various democratic parties, people's organizations, and members of the National Committee living in the local area; many provincial and municipal committees have also set up several working groups, and achieved considerable results and experience. Facts have proved that working groups are an effective organizational form for closely contacting relevant parties, fully reflecting opinions, and extensively carrying out united front activities. Therefore, we suggest that provincial and municipal committees establish such working groups in accordance with the actual needs and specific conditions of local united front work. In terms of ideological transformation, provincial and municipal committees have organized the study of current affairs and policies. Some places have also organized the study of Marxist-Leninist theory. In some places, the effect of learning is even more significant due to the organized展开 criticism and self-criticism among the members participating in the study, which is worthy of our promotion. Some provincial and municipal committees have also organized representative people from all walks of life and upper-class people from ethnic minorities to participate in the actual work of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and strengthened self-education and improved themselves from practical work. This practice is very good and can be universally adopted in various places.

    It should be pointed out that the development of the work of local committees is very uneven. Only a few places have seriously done a good job in fully consulting on major issues related to local political life and the united front, actively carrying out routine work, and systematically organizing the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, thereby giving play to the due role of the CPPCC. The existence of this situation is inseparable from the insufficient guidance and assistance of the Association to local committees.
		III
Fellow members, in the past year, China's socialist cause has made great achievements and is developing rapidly. China's people's democratic united front has therefore been further consolidated and improved. As an organization of the people's democratic united front, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and local committees at all levels have played a certain role and achieved considerable success in assisting state organs, promoting social forces to realize the general task of the state's transition period and the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, in uniting and educating all democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, fraternal nationalities, overseas Chinese, and all patriotic democratic people, in carrying out international united front activities and maintaining the world peace movement, and in contacting the people and reflecting opinions. However, our work, in general, is still not enough; the planning of the work of the Standing Committee of the National Committee is not enough; the working meeting was established late, and there is still a lack of planned organization and promotion of routine work; the guidance to the work of local CPPCC is also very insufficient; there is less contact with members living in various places. These need to be improved in future work.

    In order to expand unity and strengthen work, the Standing Committee decided through consultation to add 119 members, including newly emerging labor models in industry and agriculture, intellectuals who have made contributions in work and academia, representative people in public-private joint ventures and socialist transformation in the industrial and commercial sectors, patriotic people in religious circles, people who have revolted, and other representative people. Our conference should express a warm welcome to them. Local committees at all levels can also appropriately increase the number of members in accordance with this spirit and the needs of the local actual situation.

    In the future, the Association should further enrich the work of various departments of the Association in accordance with the General Program of the Constitution of the Association and Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, strengthen the unity and education of all kinds of people in society, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, more widely mobilize and unite the people of the whole country, work together, and strive to complete the socialist transformation and socialist construction cause as soon as possible, to oppose imperialist aggression, to liberate Taiwan, and to defend world peace.

    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告
    （1956年1月30日，在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议上）
    李济深主席、各位委员：
    我受常务委员会的委托，向本届全国委员会第二次全体会议提出工作报告。		一
    一年来，常务委员会根据中国人民政治协商会议章程总纲的七项准则和毛泽东主席关于中国人民政治协商会议五项任务的指示，进行了以下几项工作：
    （一）政治协商工作。第一次全体会议闭幕以后，常务委员会共举行了14次会议，就国家和国际的重大问题进行了协商和讨论。关于私营工商业问题常务委员会曾经组织工商界的政协委员举行座谈会，讨论了有关调整工商业公私关系的方针政策。关于农业合作化的问题，常务委员会曾经组织在京的委员和全国人民代表大会在京的代表分组讨论了中共中央提出的农业生产合作社示范章程（草案），最近又组织一部分在京委员参加了讨论中共中央提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）的座谈会，对这两个文件的条文都曾经提供了修正和补充的意见。在常务委员会第十次会议上，曾经讨论了高级知识分子问题，引起了各方面对这个问题更多的重视。常务委员会对中华人民共和国兵役法（草案），发行新人民币，汉字简化和改革以及公私合营企业推行定息办法和财产清理估价的规定等重大问题，都曾经进行了协商和讨论。在国际问题方面，常务委员会对我国参加亚非会议问题，签订中德友好合作条约问题，和其他重大国际问题，都先后听取了周恩来主席提出的报告并进行了讨论。
      （二）关于国际活动方面的工作。为了贯彻世界和平理事会关于反对使用原子武器的决议，常务委员会曾经会同中国人民保卫世界和平委员会，发起了反对使用原子武器的签名运动，签名人数达到四亿多人。在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年的时候，常务委员会曾经会同中苏友好协会总会，举行了庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年大会，表达了中苏两国人民的深厚的友谊。在意大利社会党总书记南尼先生和日本拥护宪法国民联合会访华团团长片山哲先生来我国进行访问的期间，常务委员会曾经先后邀请他们举行了讲演会。此外，常务委员会还经过其他各种形式展开了国际友好活动和维护和平运动。
      （三）关于各工作组的工作。本会设立了国际问题、工商、文化、教育、科学技术、社会福利、华侨、宗教等八个组。在京委员中自愿认定参加各组的有184人，此外并从各有关方面邀请了80人分别参加各组。各组根据各个时期国家政治生活和统一战线工作的需要，展开了它们的活动，先后共举行了41次座谈会和12次报告会，对于重要的问题如私营工商业社会主义改造的问题，中西医交流经验的问题，有关宗教界的和少数民族的问题，高等教育问题，第一个五年计划中有关文化方面的问题等，都举行了座谈或报告。在国际问题方面，除对重要问题进行了研究和座谈外，并举行了访问缅甸经过的报告和中国伊斯兰教朝觐团的报告。此外，有的工作组还组织了小型的参观和访问。
      （四）关于组织学习的工作。本会学习委员会在自愿的基础上组织了关于马克思列宁主义理论和国家政策的各种学习。一年来，除了进行二届政协全国委员会第一次全体会议有关文件的学习以外，主要是进行了中国近代史的学习和关于肃清反革命分子政策的学习。学习中国近代史的目的是为了掌握历史唯物主义的知识，批判资产阶级唯心主义思想，从而认识我国历史发展的规律。从去年2月起，由学习委员会举办了中国近代史讲座，分别邀请对近代史有研究的人士担任报告，并且分组进行讨论。在此期间，还组织了一部分人士参加了中共中央宣传部主办的宣传唯物主义、批判资产阶级唯心主义的报告会。在胡风反革命集团被揭发之后，学习委员会曾经会同文化组举行了扩大座谈会，会上一致声讨胡风反革命集团的罪行，并且建议各民主党派、民主人士和人民团体提高警惕，协助国家机关肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。随后，学习委员会又对肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子的政策组织了学习座谈会。
    本会举办的各民主党派和全国工商联的机关干部业余政治学校有学员430多人，已经学完了中国革命史和马克思列宁主义基础，现在正在学习辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义。各民主党派的机关干部参加业余政治学校后，在理论知识、政治水平和工作态度上都不断地有所提高。经验证明，对在职干部举办业余政治学校进行系统的理论教育是一个有效的办法。
      （五）关于视察工作。1955年11月间，全国人民代表大会常务委员会和本会常务委员会联合决定，组织了本会委员同全国人民代表大会代表一起到各地视察农村和城市的各项工作。本会委员还特别视察了政协省、市委员会的工作，调查了有关高级知识分子的问题。		二
    现在报告关于地方委员会的工作。根据现有的统计，已经设立了358个地方委员会，其中属于省、自治区和50万人口以上的市的有52个，属于县（市）和市区的有306个。目前尚拟陆续设立的县（市）级的地方委员会将有二百几十个。各级地方委员会的组成单位和委员名额都较原有的协商机关有显著的增加。各地方委员会的第一次全体会议，普遍地开得较好，进一步明确了政协在我国过渡时期的任务和作用，从而增强了团结，提高了认识。这对地方政治协商工作，发生了良好的作用。
    省、市地方委员会的工作一般都较过去有了改进，常务委员会经常开会，并且在不同程度上开展了各项日常工作。在政治协商工作方面，对某些重要的政策措施和重大问题，如粮食的统购统销，如农业合作化，如肃清反革命分子等重大问题，大都进行了协商。某些省、市委员会还着重对有关资本主义工商业改造的问题进行了协商和处理。不少省、市委员会对各项有关的名单和国家机关提出征求意见的某些法律、法令和条例的草案进行了协商和讨论。在密切联系群众和反映意见方面，有些省、市委员会采用通讯和个别访问等方式同委员们保持经常的联系；有的还采用民主党派、人民团体的秘书长联席会议的办法，密切与各民主党派、人民团体的联系；并且通过各民主党派、人民团体以及在当地居住的全国委员会的委员们搜集了群众的意见；还有不少省、市委员会设立了若干工作组，取得了相当的成效和经验。事实证明，工作组是密切联系有关方面、充分反映意见、广泛开展统一战线活动的有效的组织形式。因此我们建议各省、市委员会按照当地统一战线工作的实际需要和具体条件，设立这样的工作组。在思想改造工作方面，省、市委员会都组织了时事、政策学习。有些地方还组织了马克思列宁主义理论的学习，有的地方由于在参加学习的成员当中，有领导地展开了批评和自我批评，学习的效果更是显著，这是值得我们推广的。有些省、市委员会还组织了各界有代表性的人士和少数民族的上层人士，分别参加农业、手工业和资本主义工商业社会主义改造的实际工作，从实际工作中加强了自我教育和提高了自己。这样的做法很好，各地都可以普遍采用。
    应当指出，地方委员会工作的发展是很不平衡的。认真做到充分协商有关当地政治生活和统一战线的重大问题，积极地开展经常工作和系统地组织马克思列宁主义理论学习，从而发挥了政协应有的作用，还只是少数地方。这种情况的存在，同本会对地方委员会的指导和帮助不够是分不开的。		三
    各位委员，一年来，我国的社会主义事业已经取得了伟大的成就，并且正在突飞猛进地向前发展，我国人民民主统一战线因此获得进一步的巩固和提高。作为人民民主统一战线组织的中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和各级地方委员会，在协助国家机关、推动社会力量为实现国家过渡时期总任务和反对国内外敌人的斗争中，在团结和教育全国各民主阶级、民主党派、人民团体、兄弟民族、国外侨胞和一切爱国民主人士的工作中，在开展国际统一战线活动和维护世界和平的运动中，在联系人民和反映意见的活动中，都发挥了一定的作用，取得了相当的成绩。但是我们的工作，总的说来，还做得不够；全国委员会常务委员会工作的计划性不够；工作会议成立得较晚，对日常工作还缺乏有计划的组织和推动；对地方政协工作的指导也很不够；同住在各地的委员联系较少。这些都需要在今后工作中加以改进。
    为着扩大团结，加强工作，经常务委员会协商决定，增补了119位委员，其中包括新涌现出来的工农业劳动模范，在工作上学术上有贡献的知识分子，工商界公私合营和社会主义改造中的有代表性的人士，宗教界的爱国人士，起义人士以及其他方面有代表性的人士等。我们大会应该对他们表示热烈的欢迎。各级地方委员会也可以根据这种精神和当地的实际情况的需要，适当地增补委员名额。
    今后本会应当根据本会章程总纲和周恩来主席的政治报告，进一步充实本会各部门的工作，加强对社会上各类人士的团结和教育，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下更广泛地动员和团结全国人民，共同努力，为提早完成社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业、为反对帝国主义的侵略、为解放台湾、为保卫世界和平而奋斗。
