　　Must Manufacture Cars This Year
　　By our reporter Chen Ji
　　Walking into the First Automobile Works, I saw six magnificent buildings—living quarters—guarding six large workshops—the chassis workshop, the engine workshop, the foundry, the forging workshop, the body pressing workshop, and the auxiliary workshop. Various lines and pipes connect the workshops like blood vessels. Between the chassis workshop, the engine workshop, and the body pressing workshop, conveyor belts are erected, like aerial corridors connecting separate buildings. At present, most of the 13 basic production workshops of the First Automobile Works have been installed with equipment. The vast majority of this equipment is the world's first-class equipment newly manufactured by the Soviet Union. After formal production begins in the future, each workshop will carry out large-scale assembly line production according to its own unique production line; each will use its own unique conveyor belt to continuously transport the various parts manufactured, like hundreds of rivers flowing into the sea, to the final assembly workshop for assembly.
　　As I walked to the front of the chassis workshop, the loudspeaker broadcast a clear voice: "Comrades of the entire factory, we must manufacture cars as soon as possible. All members of the Zhongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, wrote to us, saying that they plan to use public accumulation funds to purchase a good car produced by our factory in 1957 and early 1958..." Many workers, farmers, and intellectuals across the country have also written here, hoping that the automobile factory will produce cars as soon as possible.
　　Can all the employees of the First Automobile Works meet the people's expectations?
　　With this question, I walked into the chassis workshop. The chassis workshop was tensely adjusting production. Many workers looked at the first set of newly assembled automobile rear axle reducer and differential, as joyful as soldiers winning a battle. This is the first set of reducers and differentials made in China, composed of dozens of parts. Each part must fully meet the technological requirements; even a slight difference is unacceptable. When the workers were trial-producing the reducer's outer shell, they tried for more than 30 days and scrapped more than 20 blanks; Soviet experts proposed more than 20 methods before it was successfully trial-produced. Song Yulin of the chassis workshop told me that with the help of Soviet experts, the workshop has now successfully trial-produced more than one hundred kinds of parts; by the end of April 1956, all parts can be successfully trial-produced, ensuring the realization of the plan to produce cars in 1956.
　　A young man in blue overalls, pointing to the machine tool, explained the performance of the machine tool while taking out a Russian process book and writing Russian technical terms on paper. I thought he was an engineer, but later learned that he was a worker named Ren Jingyou. Two years ago, he came out of Xiaogou in the Taihang Mountains and went to the Soviet Stalin Automobile Factory for an internship. At that time, he did not understand Russian and did not know how to use the new machine tools. Soviet teachers guided him and taught him hand in hand. Many times, Soviet workers sacrificed their own quotas and asked him to operate them personally, and encouraged him, saying, "It doesn't matter, be bold and do it, you won't learn if you don't do it yourself." He made several parts for the first time, all of which were up to standard. The Soviet workers shook his hand tightly, praising him for learning well. Soviet engineers taught him technical theory and helped him take notes. Some old Soviet workers saw him and asked him kindly if he had any difficulties in learning, telling him, "You must take good notes, you must understand the theory. Back then, when we went to the United States to learn technology, we couldn't take notes, we could only secretly write them down in the toilet. Today, we want to teach you everything so that you can quickly manufacture cars."
　　A year later, Ren Jingyou returned from his internship in the Soviet Union, and like all the adjusters who returned from the Soviet Union, he became a leader in the adjustment of production at the First Automobile Works. When adjusting any new part for the first time, these interns would take the lead; after the adjustment was completed, it would be handed over to the new adjusters who had just been transferred from other factories. With their help, many new adjusters have also grown up.
　　When I saw Liu Yaozong, an adjuster in the gear section of the chassis workshop, it was the day he adjusted production for the 105th time without an accident. A few months ago, he was a worker in a small private factory in Shanghai. When he first walked into the First Automobile Works, he was taken aback by the large-scale assembly line production equipment. He said to himself, "I have never touched such a machine in my life, nor have I seen such a production method. How can I get on the machine tool? How can I realize the boast I made in Shanghai—to manufacture cars for China?" A heavy stone pressed on his initially exuberant heart. Before long, he entered a training class to learn technical theory. Like a primary school student entering school for the first time, he felt that everything was new. What process science! Electro-rolling! Angles! He was overwhelmed. A desire to pursue new technologies attracted him like a magnet. He used his disobedient hands to learn to draw many drawings. He saved his wages and bought some technical books, placing them in front of his bed for careful reading.
　　The new machine tool was about to start. Liu Yaozong stood in front of the machine tool, his heart pounding, not knowing how to start. The section chief told him, "Try it on the machine tool!" Using his many years of experience, he couldn't get the position right, the difference was either half the thickness of a hair or a few hundredths of a millimeter. No matter how skillful his hands, which had relied on experience for many years, were, they could not meet the technical requirements. The first few times, he exerted all his strength and sweated profusely, spending half a day adjusting one part; but after inspection, it was still not completely qualified. He was not discouraged, recording each failure lesson in a small notebook, looking everywhere for technical theory books, studying process knowledge; as soon as he saw an intern returning from the Soviet Union, he ran up and asked this and that. In front of his bed, drawings were often hung. Before going to bed, he looked at the drawings in the light, as absorbed as if he were looking at something new and strange. Now, he can not only trial-produce qualified parts according to the requirements of the process, but also, with the help of the section chief and five process workers, he first created a new record of adjusting parts one hundred times without accidents.
　　The adjusters in each section of the chassis workshop, like Liu Yaozong, are growing up rapidly, able to independently operate machine tools and manufacture car parts. Workers in the other seven basic production workshops and auxiliary workshops are also carrying out labor competitions, striving to adjust production as soon as possible. Workers in the auxiliary workshops have manufactured more than six thousand kinds of precision tools to ensure the needs of adjusting production. While manufacturing tools, they are urging materials. Deputy Chief Engineer Meng Shaonong said with emotion: "We originally estimated that adjusting production would be very difficult; but as soon as we started adjusting, the workers made rapid progress and the work went smoothly. Now, the workshops that have adjusted production are all clamoring: not enough tasks, not enough materials. Many workshops are about to run out of blanks in almost no time. We must quickly do a good job in material preparation."
　　The newly growing automobile industry is like a huge engine, promoting the reform of many industrial technologies across the country. Whether the First Automobile Works produces cars in 1956 depends not only on the factory itself, but also on many brother factories outside the factory. The cooperative products of 405 kinds of automobiles must be trial-produced by 40 factories across the country. The Xiaowujin Factory in Changchun City is a small factory with low technology and poor conditions, but in order to produce cars as soon as possible, it has worked hard to overcome various technically backward difficulties and is trial-producing 34 kinds of large new products for the First Automobile Works, of which 24 kinds have passed the qualification. The Beijing First Automobile Parts Factory and the Shenyang Battery Factory are both successfully trial-producing many new products for the First Automobile Works that China has never made before. The efforts of these brother factories will surely guarantee that the First Automobile Works will manufacture cars in 1956.

### 一定在今年制造出汽车来

　　一定在今年制造出汽车来
    本报记者　陈迹
    走进第一汽车制造厂，看见六座雄伟的高楼——生活间，挡卫着六个大工场——底盘工场、摩托工场、铸工场、锻工场、车身压制工场和辅助工场。各种线路和管道像血管一样把各个工场、车间连接起来。在底盘工场同摩托工场、车身压制工场之间，架设了输送带，像是接连相隔的楼房的凌空走廊。现在第一汽车制造厂13个基本生产车间，大部分已安装好设备。这些设备，绝大部分是苏联新近制造出来的世界上第一流的好设备。将来正式生产以后，各车间将按着各自特有的生产线，进行大流水式的生产；都要用各自特有的输送带，百水汇川一般地把制造出来的各种零件，连绵不断地运往总装配车间装配。
    我走到底盘工场的门前，扩音器传来了广播员清晰的声音：“全厂职工同志们，我们要早日制造出汽车来，吉林省蛟河县中兴农业生产合作社全体社员给我们来信，说准备在1957年和1958年初用公积金购买一辆我们厂出产的好汽车……。”全国许多工人、农民和知识分子也写信到这里，希望汽车厂早日制出汽车来。
    第一汽车制造厂全体职工能不能满足人民的希望呢？
    我带着这个疑问，走进了底盘工场。工场内的底盘车间正在紧张地调整生产。许多工人望着第一套新装配出来的汽车后桥部分减速器和差速器，好像战士打胜仗一样喜悦。这是中国自己制造的第一套减速器和差速器，它们是由几十种零件组成的。每种零件，都得完全合乎工艺要求，差一点也不行。工人们在试制减速器的外壳的时候，试了30多天，废了20多个毛胚；苏联专家提出20多种办法，才试制好。底盘车间宋玉麟告诉我：在苏联专家帮助下，现在车间已试制成功了一百多种零件；到1956年4月底就可以试制好全部零件，保证实现1956年出产汽车的计划。
    一个穿蓝色工作服的年轻人，指着机床，一面讲解机床的性能，一面拿出俄文的工艺书，在纸上写着俄文的技术名词。我以为他是工程师，后来才知道他是工人，名叫任景佑。两年以前，他从太行区小沟里走出来，到苏联斯大林汽车工厂去实习。那时候，他不懂俄文，不知道怎样使唤新式机床。苏联老师引导他，把着手教他。许多次，苏联工人牺牲自己的定额，叫他亲自操作，并且鼓励他说：“不要紧，你大胆干吧，不亲自干，就学不会。”他头一次干了几个零件，都合规格。苏联工人紧紧握着他的手，称赞他学得好。苏联工程师教他技术理论，帮他做笔记。有些苏联老工人看见他，亲切问他学习有没有困难。告诉他：“你要好好做笔记，要弄懂理论。当年我们到美国学技术，不能做笔记，只能偷偷地在厕所里记。今天我们要把什么都教给你，让你们赶快制造出汽车来。”
    一年以后，任景佑从苏联实习回来，和所有从苏联实习回来的调整工一样，成了第一汽车制造厂调整生产中的带头人。初次调整任何一种新零件，他们这些实习生就首先出马；等调整好了以后，才交给从别的工厂刚调来的新调整工。在他们的帮助下，许多新调整工也成长起来了。
    我看见底盘车间齿轮工部调整工刘耀宗的时候，正是他调整生产105台次没有出过事故的那天。几个月以前，他还是上海一家小私营工厂的工人。他第一次走进第一汽车制造厂的时候，看见大流水式的生产设备，不禁吃了一惊。他对自己说：“我一生也没摸过这样的机器，也没看过这样的生产方法。我怎么能上机床呢？怎么能实现我在上海夸下的海口——为中国制造汽车呢？”在他初来的兴致勃勃的心上压上了一块沉重的石头。没有多久，他进了训练班，学习技术理论。他像第一次进学校的小学生，感到什么都新鲜。什么工艺学呀！电滚呀！角度呀！使他应接不暇。一种追求新技术的欲望，像磁铁一般地吸引着他。他用自己不听使换的手，学画了许多图样。他省下工钱，买了一些技术书，摆在床前，细细阅读。
    新机床要开动了。刘耀宗站在机床前面，心里乱跳，不知道怎么下手才好。工部主任告诉他：“你上机床试试吧！”他用他多年的老经验，怎么也定不好位，不是相差头发丝一半那样粗，就是相差零点零几公厘那样远。凭他那双多年靠经验干活的手多么灵巧，也达不到技术上的要求。头几次，他别着一股劲，出了一身汗，试了半天功夫，才调整出一个零件；但是一经检查，还不完全合格。他不灰心，把每次失败的教训记在小本子上，到处找技术理论书，钻研工艺方面的知识；一看见从苏联回来的实习生，就跑上去，问这问那。在他床头前，经常挂着图纸。他睡觉以前，在灯光中看着图纸，就像看着什么新奇的事物那样入神。现在，他不仅能够按照工艺的要求，试造出合格的零件来，而且在工部主任和五个工序工的帮助下首先创造了调整零件一百台次无事故的新纪录。
    底盘车间各个工部的调整工，都像刘耀宗一样飞快地成长起来，能够独立操纵机床，制造汽车的零件。其他七个基本生产车间和辅助工场的工人，也开展劳动竞赛，争取早日调整好生产。辅助工场工人已经制造出六千多种精密的工具，保证调整生产的需要。他们一面制造工具，一面催促材料。孟少农副总工程师感慨地说：“我们原来估计，调整生产很困难；但是一开始调整，工人们进步挺快，工作很顺利。现在已经调整生产的车间都叫唤：任务不足，材料不够。许多车间几乎不费多少时间，就要吃光毛胚了。我们要赶快做好物资准备工作。”
    新成长的汽车工业像一座巨大的发动机，推动着全国许多工业技术的改革。第一汽车制造厂1956年出产汽车，不但决定于厂内，而且也决定于厂外的好多个兄弟工厂。405种汽车的协作产品，要靠全国40个工厂试造。长春市小五金厂是个技术低条件差的小厂，但是为着早日出产汽车，努力战胜种种技术落后的困难，替第一汽车制造厂试制着34种大的新产品，已经合格了24种。北京第一汽车附件厂和沈阳电池厂，都在胜利地为第一汽车制造厂试造着许多中国从未造过的新产品。这些兄弟工厂的努力，一定能保证第一汽车制造厂1956年制造出汽车来。
