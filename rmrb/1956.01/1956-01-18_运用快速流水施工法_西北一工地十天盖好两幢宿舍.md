    Using Rapid Flow-Line Construction Method
    Northwest Construction Site Builds Two Dormitories in Ten Days
    The Second Engineering Company directly under the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau used the rapid flow-line construction method on a trial basis and completed two family dormitories (totaling 20 rooms) in ten days. According to preliminary calculations, this construction method shortens the construction time by 14 to 20 days and saves about 30% of labor compared to general construction methods.
    This advanced construction method was implemented on a trial basis based on the suggestion of Soviet expert Comrade Puchkovsky and with his specific assistance.
    Now, other engineering companies under the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau are also preparing to promote this advanced construction method.

    运用快速流水施工法
    西北一工地十天盖好两幢宿舍
    西北工程管理总局第二工程公司直属工地试用快速流水施工法，在十天内盖好了两幢眷属宿舍（共20间）。据初步计算，用这种施工方法，施工时间比一般施工方法缩短14天到20天，节约劳动力30％左右。
    这种先进的施工方法是根据苏联专家普契柯夫斯基同志的建议，并在他的具体帮助下试行的。
    现在，西北工程管理总局所属的其他各工程公司，也都准备推广这种先进的施工方法。
