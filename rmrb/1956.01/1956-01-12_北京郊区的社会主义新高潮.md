    Beijing's Suburban Socialist Upsurge
    By Our Correspondent
    These past few days, the rural areas in the suburbs of Beijing have been filled with the sound of drums and gongs, echoing the sound of firecrackers in the city. Just as all private industrial and commercial enterprises in the city were transformed into joint state-private enterprises, all the primary agricultural producers' cooperatives in the five suburban districts have been converted into advanced cooperatives. The farmers in the capital's suburbs have accomplished a historic undertaking, fulfilling a great aspiration of many years.
    By the end of 1955, all farmers in the near suburbs of Beijing had joined semi-socialist cooperatives. Initially, each district planned to convert all primary cooperatives into advanced cooperatives in 1956. Some rural work cadres already considered this a fast pace. However, when they saw the vast socialist enthusiasm of the farmers moving forward bravely, they revised their original plans.
    In the roaring socialist upsurge, every village, every cooperative, and every farming household truly influenced each other, promoted each other, and moved forward together, responding to every call. People visited relatives, called on friends, and inquired about news everywhere, fearing that their village or cooperative would lag behind others. As a result, advanced cooperatives were established one after another. The farmers said proudly: Now it's "universal blossoming"! Peace Township and three other townships in the eastern suburbs were planning to merge and establish an advanced cooperative of more than 2,000 households. On January 4th, the head of the District Committee's Rural Work Department went to Peace Township to help them prepare for the conversion. He had just arrived in the township when the members' meeting had already been held. Issues such as merging cooperatives, converting to advanced cooperatives, admitting landlords and rich peasants into the cooperatives, and production plans were all resolved smoothly. The farmers in Liulitun Township heard that Peace Cooperative in Peace Township and May First Cooperative in Nanga Township had been converted into advanced cooperatives and were very anxious, saying: None of our township's work has lagged behind, how can we lag behind in this conversion! At the unanimous request of the farmers in the township, the four cooperatives, Guangming, Guanghua, Guangxing, and Guangrong, were quickly merged into an advanced cooperative.
    The enthusiasm of the members of the agricultural producers' cooperatives for converting to advanced cooperatives continued to rise. After the head of an agricultural cooperative in Shijingshan District finished speaking at the members' meeting on the conversion, the members shouted in unison: "Agreed!" "No objections!" While they were holding the meeting, they discussed the benefits of converting to an advanced cooperative:
    "This will save the accountants a lot of trouble."
    "It will also reduce a lot of trouble in handing over public grain."
    The East Suburb District did not have a single advanced cooperative in 1955, and some cadres believed that it would be impossible to convert all the existing agricultural producers' cooperatives into advanced cooperatives in a short period of time. But what was the reality? The Nanga Township Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in this district quickly and smoothly passed the resolution to convert to an advanced cooperative at the general meeting of all members on the evening of the 7th. The facts educated the cadres and greatly strengthened their confidence in leading this work. They said: We must work with the masses to beat all the drums and gongs!
    The time is completely ripe, and the farmers have firmly embarked on the broad road to eternal happiness. There are many factors that have created this situation, and one of the most powerful factors is the seven-year long-range plan for the city's suburbs formulated by the Beijing Municipal Party Committee last December. Li Kuan, a member of the Guangrong Cooperative in Qilitun Township, East Suburb District, said: "According to the District Committee's plan, the telephone will be connected by the end of March, and then several townships will jointly work together. By May or June, the water from the Yongding River will also be diverted to the eastern suburbs! We are still one township with four cooperatives, slowly engaging in production, how can this work! With such good conditions, why not take a big step forward sooner!" Merging several primary cooperatives into an advanced cooperative is a characteristic of this cooperative movement upsurge. Cheng Yongshun, the secretary of the Qilitun Township branch, mentioned the benefits of advanced cooperatives, saying: "In the past, the four cooperatives in the township were all different, making it very inconvenient for the township to lead. Now that they are merged into one cooperative, it is easier to solve problems, and the work of the whole township will be promoted."
    The tide of converting to advanced cooperatives has become a huge force driving cooperative members to actively produce. The day after the Qiansheng and Xinguang cooperatives in Qianbajia Township, Haidian District, merged and converted to advanced cooperatives, the cooperative used 50 large carts to haul back more than 90 carts of soil fertilizer. They are confident of overfulfilling the plan to accumulate 12,000 carts of fertilizer. After the agricultural cooperative in Baimiao Township, Shijingshan District, converted to an advanced cooperative, the attendance rate of cooperative members reached 100%. The newly converted advanced cooperative in Dajing Township, Fengtai District, proposed this year's high-yield plan: everything must be increased, and just the 20 mu of high-yield corn will yield 20,000 jin.

    北京郊区的社会主义新高潮
    本报记者
    这几天北京市郊区农村中锣鼓喧天，和市区的爆竹声遥相呼应。全市的私营工商业刚刚全部实行公私合营，近郊五个区的全部初级农业生产合作社就转成高级社了。首都郊区的农民完成了一件历史性的大事业，实现了多少年来的大心愿。
    1955年底，北京市近郊的农民全部加入了半社会主义的合作社。起初，各区计划在1956年把全部初级合作社转成高级社。有些农村工作干部已经认为这是很快的速度了。但是，当他们看到广大农民勇往直前的社会主义热情的时候，也就修改了原来的计划。
    在轰轰烈烈的社会主义高潮中，各个乡村，各个合作社，各户农民，真是互相影响，互相推动，共同前进，一呼百应。人们串亲戚，访朋友，到处打听消息，唯恐自己的乡、社落在人家的后面。于是，高级社就此呼彼应地纷纷诞生了。农民们很自豪地说：如今就是“普遍开花”！东郊区和平乡等四个乡酝酿合并成立一个二千多户的高级社，1月4日，区委农村工作部长到和平乡帮助他们筹备转社工作，刚刚赶到这个乡里，社员大会已经开过了。并社、转社、吸收地主、富农入社和生产计划等问题，完全顺利地解决了。六里屯乡的农民们听说和平乡的和平社、南皋乡的五一社都转成了高级社，很着急，都说：我们乡那一项工作都没落后，这回转社怎么能够落后！在全乡农民一致要求下，光明、光华、光兴、光荣等四个社很快地并成了一个高级社。
    农业生产合作社的社员们要求转高级社的热情不断高涨。石景山区一个农业社的社长在转社的社员大会上刚讲完话，社员们就在下面异口同声地喊着：“同意！”“没意见！”他们一边开会，一边谈论转高级社的好处：
    “这一来省了会计好多事。”
    “交公粮也少了不少麻烦。”
    东郊区在1955年连一个高级社都没有，有些干部认为在短时间里把原有的农业生产合作社全部转为高级社是不可能的。但事实是怎样的呢？这个区的南皋乡农业生产合作社在7日晚上的全体社员大会上，很快就顺利地通过了转高级社的决议。事实教育了干部，并且大大增强了干部领导这一工作的信心。他们说：咱们一定要和群众一起把所有的锣鼓都敲起来！
    时机已经完全成熟，农民们坚定地走上了永远幸福的康庄大道。造成这种形势的因素非常多，最有力的因素之一，就是去年12月北京市委所拟定的市郊七年远景规划。东郊区七里屯乡的光荣社社员李宽说：“按照区委的规划，三月底电话就要通过来，那时候几个乡就要联合办公。到五、六月间，永定河的水也要引到东郊来！我们还是一个乡四个社，慢腾腾地搞生产，这怎么行！有了那样的好条件，为什么不早往前迈一大步！”几个初级社并成一个高级社，是这次合作化高潮的特点。七里屯乡支部书记程永顺提到高级社的好处说：“过去全乡四个社，四个样，乡里领导很不方便。现在并成一个社，发生了问题就好解决，全乡的工作就推动起来了。”
    转高级社的浪潮，已经成为推动社员积极生产的巨大动力。海淀区前八家乡前生、新光两个社并社转成高级社的第二天，社里用50辆大车拉回了90多车土肥。他们有信心超额完成积肥12，000车的计划。石景山区白庙乡农业社转高级社以后，社员的出勤率达到100％。丰台区大井乡新转成的高级社，提出了今年的丰产计划：样样都要增产，只是20亩丰产玉米，就要收两万斤。
