    Anshan Iron and Steel Works Steelworkers Launch Rapid Steelmaking Competition
    Guarantee Completion of the First Quarter Production Plan Three Days Ahead of Schedule
    The workers of three open-hearth furnaces in the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant have decided to complete this year's first quarter production plan three days ahead of schedule. This was proposed with a pioneering spirit at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works steelworkers' representative meeting held on the 17th. They guarantee to produce steel grades according to plan, achieve a production rate of 94%, and maintain a furnace breakdown rate of no more than 3%.
    To achieve this goal, the workers decided to further study advanced Soviet experience, launch a rapid steelmaking movement, increase the number of rapid steelmaking furnaces to over 30%, produce 7.5 tons of steel per square meter of furnace bottom area per day and night, and achieve an effective operating rate of 88%.
    The initiative of the 3 open-hearth furnace workers in the steelmaking plant was echoed by other open-hearth furnace workers. At the meeting on the 17th, representatives from various steelmaking units signed a contract to further carry out the rapid steelmaking competition.

    鞍钢炼钢工人开展快速炼钢竞赛
    保证提前三天完成第一季度生产计划
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂三个平炉的职工，决定提前三天完成今年第一季度生产计划。这是他们在17日召开的鞍钢炼钢工人代表会议上以首倡精神提出的。他们保证按计划生产钢种，并使生产率达到94％，炼炉率不超过3％。
    职工们为了实现这个指标，决定进一步学习苏联先进经验，开展快速炼钢运动，使快速炼钢的炉数达到30％以上，每一平方公尺的炉底面积每昼夜生产7.5吨钢，有效作业率达到88％。
    炼钢厂3个平炉职工的倡议，得到了其他平炉职工的响应。在17日的会议上，各炼钢单位的代表签订了深入开展快速炼钢竞赛的合同。
