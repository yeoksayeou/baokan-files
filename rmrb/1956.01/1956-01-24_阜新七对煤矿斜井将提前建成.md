    Fuxin No. 7 Coal Mine Inclined Shaft to be Completed Ahead of Schedule
    The Fuxin Mining Bureau will complete the No. 7 Inclined Shaft ahead of schedule. Among these inclined shafts, two are newly built, two are renovated, and three are restored. The newly built Ping'an Western Inclined Shaft was originally scheduled to be handed over for production in February 1957, but it has now been decided to hand it over for production on October 1 this year, four months ahead of schedule. The renovated Ping'an No. 1 and No. 2 inclined shafts have been decided to be handed over for production at the end of this year, both three months ahead of schedule.
    In order to accelerate the speed of roadway construction, the Fuxin Mining Bureau has decided that all inclined shafts should universally promote the advanced experience of Li Baoshu's rapid tunneling team.
    After these inclined shafts are handed over for production ahead of schedule, the country will obtain hundreds of thousands of tons of coal more during the first Five-Year Plan period.

    阜新七对煤矿斜井将提前建成
    阜新矿务局将提前建成七对斜井。这些斜井中有新建的和改建的各两对，恢复的三对。新建平安西部斜井原计划1957年2月移交生产，现在决定提前4个月在今年10月1日移交生产。改建的平安一坑、二坑两对斜井决定提前3个月都在今年年末移交生产。
    阜新矿务局为了加快巷道建设速度，决定各斜井一律推广李宝书快速掘进队的先进经验。
    这批斜井提前移交生产以后，将使国家在第一个五年计划期间内多得几十万吨煤炭。　　　（新华社）
