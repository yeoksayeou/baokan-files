A Critique of the U.S. Fiscal Year 1957 Budget
　　Qin Benli

U.S. President Eisenhower submitted the budget message for the 1957 fiscal year to Congress on the 16th. The policy indicated by this message is large-scale expansion of armaments and war preparations. In the face of the rising tide of the world peace movement, the U.S. government has actually put forward such a budget to intensify war preparations, which cannot but arouse the serious attention of the people of the world and the infinite concern of the American people.

The characteristic of the U.S. fiscal year 1957 budget is that military spending has greatly increased while total expenditures have also increased. Total expenditure is 65.8 billion U.S. dollars, about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars more than in the 1956 fiscal year; direct military expenditure is more than 40.4 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of about 1 billion U.S. dollars over the 1956 fiscal year. This accounts for a huge proportion of 61% of the total expenditure. This does not include the tens of billions of U.S. dollars in surplus funds from previous fiscal years, which were mainly used to purchase military arms and weapons.

The focus of the huge military expenditure is to strengthen the so-called "retaliatory power," which means greatly increasing the air force, naval power, as well as atomic weapons and guided missiles, and re-equipping the armed forces with "new weapons." Of the 35.5 billion U.S. dollars directly spent by the Department of Defense, the largest portion is used for the Air Force, totaling more than 16.5 billion U.S. dollars, with plans to add 10 air force groups, especially long-range bombers. The total expenditure on atomic energy is 1.9 billion U.S. dollars, which is the largest figure for atomic energy since the 1953 fiscal year budget nearly 10 years ago. During the 1957 fiscal year, it will expand its stockpile of various styles and sizes of nuclear weapons. The expenditure on purchasing guided missiles reached more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, one-third more than in the 1956 fiscal year and about double that of the 1955 fiscal year, which is the highest amount of funding spent in this area in U.S. history. "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, which often reflects the interests of U.S. military-industrial monopoly capital, recently revealed that "the government has notified private companies manufacturing guided missiles to go all out" and "not to try to save money." In the 1957 fiscal year, the number of army and navy units equipped with new weapons such as atomic weapons and guided missiles will also increase.

At the same time, the number of U.S. conventional troops will increase from more than 2.81 million to about 2.83 million, and if necessary, increase to more than 2.9 million.

The budget message shows that while stepping up large-scale arms expansion, it will also strengthen preparations for provoking new wars in the Asian region. The appropriation planned under the "Mutual Security Program" in the 1957 fiscal year is expected to reach 4.9 billion U.S. dollars, which is 2.2 billion U.S. dollars more than the 2.7 billion U.S. dollars passed in the 1956 fiscal year. The actual expenditure of the entire "Mutual Security Program" in the 1957 fiscal year will reach 4.3 billion U.S. dollars, of which "military assistance" accounts for 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, half of which is given to Turkey, Pakistan, as well as the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Not only that, but future "military assistance" programs will enable U.S. "supported forces to effectively use modern weapons," and as soon as possible "allocate available funds for necessary negotiations and plans, and to begin purchasing jet aircraft, missiles, and electronic equipment." As for "economic assistance" and "technical assistance," they are still for the purpose of "supporting greater defense forces," and will be specifically used as "funds for implementing defense support programs in critical areas including Southern Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Far East."

The warmongering plans of the U.S. authorities are truly exposed! However, in order to divert world public attention from their intensified arms race, they are trying to make it seem as if the United States is expanding its armaments because the Soviet Union did not agree to "a disarmament plan that can be verified by full inspection." What is the value of this statement? Who doesn't know that when the Soviet Union unilaterally reduced its army by 640,000 troops last year, the United States was increasing its armed forces? Who doesn't know that when the Soviet Union abandoned its military base on the Porkkala Peninsula, the United States was establishing more and more military bases on foreign territories? Now, the Soviet Union's military expenditure in the 1956 budget is 10 billion rubles less than in 1955, while the United States has increased military expenditure. This stark contrast shows who is violating the "Geneva spirit" and who is engaged in an arms race. U.S. military commentator, retired Brigadier General Phillips believes that the part of Eisenhower's State of the Union address related to military issues shows that the U.S. government is betting on atomic weapons, "therefore unwilling to participate in international efforts to seek atomic disarmament." This is exactly the case, the U.S. fiscal year 1957 budget expenditure proves the United States' intensified atomic arms race and stubborn attitude of resisting arms reduction.

This plan to persist in the bankrupt policy of atomic intimidation and blackmail backed by "positions of strength" cannot intimidate the peace-loving people of the world, and attempts to use this method to deal with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are very rude and have repeatedly proven to be unsuccessful. This can only intensify international tensions, create new difficulties for consultation and cooperation between major powers, and further lower the international status of the United States.

Of course, this policy does increase the profits of U.S. military-industrial monopoly capital to an unprecedented level. In 1955, the income of U.S. monopoly capital reached a record-breaking level, with net earnings of approximately 22 billion U.S. dollars after taxes, compared to 17 billion U.S. dollars in 1954. But for the American people, it can only bring them greater disasters. Of the 66.3 billion U.S. dollars in total revenue in the 1957 fiscal year, the largest source of income is "individual income tax," reaching 35.1 billion U.S. dollars, which means that about 50 cents of every U.S. dollar in U.S. government revenue belongs to this type of income. The total revenue for the 1957 fiscal year increased by 1.8 billion U.S. dollars compared to the 1956 fiscal year, of which "individual income tax" increased by approximately 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. It is clear that the U.S. government is relying on further plundering the American working people to continue to pursue its "policy of strength."

In sharp contrast to the surge in military spending and increased taxes, the government's expenditure on people's welfare is negligible. Among the items classified by purpose in the 1957 fiscal year budget expenditure, the so-called "labor and welfare" expenditure is only more than 2.9 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 4.4% of the total expenditure; in the classification by government department expenditure, the "Department of Health, Education, and Welfare" is only more than 2.3 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for slightly more than 3.5% of the total expenditure. In a special education message submitted to Congress by Eisenhower on January 12, he suggested allocating an average of only 400 million U.S. dollars per year as the federal government's "aid" to education, which is equivalent to 1% of the direct military expenditure in the U.S. 1956 fiscal year and 0.9% of the direct military expenditure in the 1957 fiscal year. However, due to the lack of school buildings, approximately 1 million children in the United States lose the opportunity to attend school each year.

Taking measures to lower the people's living standards to step up arms expansion is impossible to achieve a balanced budget. However, the Republican government is now particularly touting the 1957 fiscal year budget as a "balanced" budget where expenditure does not exceed income. This is certainly related to this year's presidential election. But the author of the message cannot but admit that under the huge military expenditure, the national debt in the first half of the 1957 fiscal year will increase and "will temporarily exceed" 275 billion U.S. dollars. And even American bourgeois figures are now worried about the decline in economic activity, which is expected to increase revenue.

The above facts show that the U.S. fiscal year 1957 budget is a budget for destructive large-scale arms expansion and war preparations, a budget that further intensifies the plunder of the American working people, and a budget that enables military-industrial monopoly capital to obtain more profits. This situation proves that the easing of the international situation is completely unpalatable to the U.S. rulers, and also reflects the increasingly unstable situation of the U.S. economy. All peace-loving people in the world, including the American people, must be vigilant and should carry out unremitting struggle to stop the arms race and defend world peace.

    评美国1957财政年度预算
    钦本立
    美国总统艾森豪威尔16日向国会提出了1957财政年度的预算咨文。这一咨文所表明的政策是：大规模扩军备战。在世界和平运动日益高涨的形势下，美国政府竟提出了这样一个加紧准备战争的预算，不能不引起世界人民的严重注意和美国人民的无限忧虑。
    美国1957财政年度预算的特点，是在总支出增加的情况下军费支出大大增加。总支出658亿美元，比1956财政年度约多16亿美元；直接军费支出是404多亿美元，比1956财政年度增加约10亿美元。占总支出61％的巨大比例。这还不包括过去一些财政年度主要用来购买军火武器的数百亿美元的结余款项。
    巨大的军费支出的重点，是加强所谓“报复性的力量”，也就是要大大增加空军、海军力量，以及原子武器和定向飞弹等，并且用“新武器”重新装备各军种。在国防部直接开支的355亿美元中，最大的部分就用在空军，计165亿多美元，计划增加10个空军大队，特别是增加长距离轰炸机。原子能方面的开支总额为19亿美元，这是将近10年来仅次于1953财政年度预算用于原子能方面的最大数字。在1957财政年度内将扩大它的各种式样和各种大小的核子武器的储存。购买定向飞弹的经费达12亿多美元，比1956财政年度多三分之一，比1955财政年度增加约一倍，是美国历史上用在这方面的经费最高的数目。经常反映美国军火垄断资本利益的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志最近一期透露，“政府已通知制造定向飞弹的私营公司全力以赴地干”、“不要图省钱”。陆军、海军配备原子武器、定向飞弹等新武器的部队在1957财政年度也将增多起来。
    与此同时，美国常规军队的兵员数将从281万多人增加到约283万人，必要时再增加到290万多人。
    预算咨文表明：在加紧大规模扩张军备的同时，还将加强在亚洲地区挑起新战争的准备。1957财政年度在“共同安全计划”项下预订合同的拨款，计划达到49亿美元，这比1956财政年度通过的27亿美元多22亿美元。1957财政年度整个“共同安全计划”的实际开支将达到43亿美元，“军事援助”占25亿美元，其中的一半是给予土耳其、巴基斯坦以及南朝鲜李承晚集团和蒋介石卖国集团。不但如此，未来的“军事援助”计划将使美国“帮助支持下的部队可以有效使用现代武器”，并且，尽快“拨出可供使用的款项，以便进行必要的谈判和计划以及着手购买喷气飞机、飞弹和电子设备”。至于“经济援助”和“技术援助”，也依然是为了“支持更大的防御力量”的目的，并且要特别用来作为“包括南欧、中东、南亚、东南亚和远东的危急地区实行防御支持计划的经费”。
    美国当局的好战计划真是暴露无遗！但是，为了转移世界公众对于他们加紧军备竞赛的注意，他们企图把事情说成这样，似乎是由于苏联不同意“一个能够以充分的视察来证实的裁军计划”的缘故，美国才扩充军备。这种说法有什么价值呢？谁不知道，当苏联去年单独裁减它的陆军64万人的时候，美国正在增加它的武装部队？谁又不知道，当苏联放弃它的波卡拉半岛的军事基地的时候，美国却在外国领土上建立愈来愈多的军事基地？现在，苏联1956年度预算的军事开支比1955年减少100亿卢布，而美国增加了军事开支。这种鲜明的对比说明究竟谁违背了“日内瓦精神”，谁在进行军备竞赛。美国军事评论员、退职的准将菲利普斯认为艾森豪威尔国情咨文中有关军事问题的部分，表明美国政府把赌注押在原子武器上，“因此不愿意参加谋求原子裁军的国际努力。”事情正是这样，美国1957财政年度预算支出证明了美国加紧原子军备竞赛和抗拒裁减军备的顽固态度。
    这种打算坚持破产了的以“实力地位”为后盾的原子恫吓和讹诈政策，吓不倒世界爱好和平的人民，企图用这种办法来同苏联和各人民民主国家打交道是非常粗鲁的、并且已一再为事实证明不会成功的。这只能使国际紧张局势加剧，为大国协商和合作造成新的困难，使美国的国际地位更加低落。
    当然，这种政策却使美国军火垄断资本的利润增加到空前的程度，1955年美国垄断资本收入达到了打破记录的水平，除去纳税外净得约220亿美元，而1954年是170亿美元。但是对美国人民来说，只能给他们带来更大的灾难。在1957财政年度663亿美元的总收入中，最大的进款是“个人所得税”，达351亿美元，即在美国政府每一块美元收入中有5角左右属于这一类进款。1957财政年度总收入比1956财政年度增加了18亿美元，其中“个人所得税”即增加约15亿美元。由此可见，美国政府是依靠进一步掠夺美国劳动人民来继续推行它的“实力政策”的。
    与军费激增、赋税加重形成尖锐对照的是，政府有关人民福利经费的开支少得微不足道。1957财政年度预算支出按用途分类的项目中，所谓“劳工和福利”经费的支出只29亿多美元，占总支出的4.4％；依政府部门支出分类中，“卫生、教育及福利部”只23亿多美元，占总支出的3.5％多一点。1月12日艾森豪威尔向国会提出的教育特别咨文中，建议平均每年只拨出4亿美元作为联邦政府对教育事业的“援助”，这个数目相当于美国1956财政年度直接军事费用的1％，1957财政年度直接军事开支的0.9％。但是由于缺乏校舍，美国每年约有100万儿童失去求学机会。
    采取降低人民生活水平的办法来加紧扩张军备，是不可能实现预算平衡的。可是，共和党政府现在却特别标榜1957财政年度的预算是一个支出不超过收入的“平衡的”预算。这当然和今年的总统选举有关。但咨文的作者不能不承认：在庞大的军费支出下，1957财政年度上半年的国债将要增加，并且“将会暂时超过”2，750亿美元。而指望增加收入的经济活动，现在连美国资产阶级人士也在担心它的下降。
    以上事实说明，美国1957财政年度的预算，是进行破坏性的大规模的扩军备战的预算，是进一步加重掠夺美国劳动人民的预算，是使军火垄断资本取得更多利润的预算。这种情况，证明国际局势的缓和完全不合美国统治者的口味，同时也反映了美国经济愈来愈不稳定的局面。全世界爱好和平的人民、包括美国人民在内，必须提高警惕，并且应该为停止军备竞赛和保卫世界和平而进行坚持不懈的斗争。
