Xinhua News Agency, New York, 21st (TASS dispatch): On the evening of January 20th, a well-attended gathering was held at "Carnegie Hall" in New York to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the publication of the "Daily Worker."

    Dennis, General Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, delivered a speech at the meeting. He analyzed the events that had occurred in the past five years. Dennis emphasized that, in these five years, everyone had witnessed the "rise and fall of McCarthyism" and the development of the people's resistance to "hostile forces endangering peace and democracy" in the United States. Dennis particularly pointed out the Communist Party's struggle against launching an atomic war. He said that five years ago, the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States were imprisoned for advocating peaceful coexistence among all nations, but now, the broad masses of the American people "recognize the possibility of peaceful negotiations." Dennis concluded by calling on American Communists to intensify the struggle for peace and for friendship among all nations.
