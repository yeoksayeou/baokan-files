　　America's "Treaty Mania"
    "New York Times" reporter Sulzberger once calculated the number of military alliances the United States had concluded around the world. According to him, the United States has expanded its influence to 45 countries through military treaties. And during Dulles' tenure as U.S. Secretary of State, all the military alliances planned by the United States, except for West Germany, were in Asia.
    The United States' "love" for concluding military alliances has earned it the somewhat ironic reputation of "treaty maniac." However, even with this frenzied pursuit of various military alliances, many commentators in the American bourgeois press admit that these military alliances have not brought the United States the benefits it expected. Walter Lippmann recently pointed out in the "Washington Post" that the people of various countries do not welcome this U.S. military bloc policy. He said, "The basic trouble with our military plans in South Asia and the Middle East is that it involves us in entangling alliances. Our theory is that we will arm those countries that are ready to stand up and openly declare their opposition to the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists. The fact that contradicts this theory is that South Asia believes that these military alliances between small Asian countries and the distant United States are political interference in the disputes of that region."
    Richard Lowenthal of Britain also said in "The Observer" that the Western countries' "treaty mania" will only reduce their prestige in the eyes of the people of other countries, especially because of "the different situation created by the Soviet Union's new policies in backward countries."
    Even so, Dulles not long ago regarded the conclusion of military alliances as one of the main aspects of American foreign policy. Then let the likes of Dulles indulge in their "treaty mania." The aggressive military treaties they plan cannot restrain the feet of the Asian people who are marching towards peace, democracy, and independence.

### 美国的“条约狂”

　　美国的“条约狂”
    “纽约时报”的记者苏兹贝格曾经给美国在全世界缔结的军事联盟算了一笔账。据他说，美国通过军事条约把它的势力扩张到了45个国家。而在杜勒斯充当美国国务卿这个时期中，美国所策划的军事联盟，除了西德以外，其余的都是在亚洲。
    美国对于缔结军事联盟的这种“爱好”，已经使它赢得了并非没有讽刺意味的“条约狂”的名声。但是，即使发狂一样地追求到了形形色色的军事联盟，美国资产阶级报纸的许多评论员却承认，这些军事联盟并没有给美国带来它所预期的那些好处。华尔特·李普曼最近就在“华盛顿邮报”上指出，各国人民并不欢迎美国这种军事集团政策。他说，“我们在南亚和中东的军事计划的基本麻烦是：它使我们卷入了纠缠不清的联盟。我们的理论是，我们将武装那些准备站起来并且公开宣布它们同苏联和中国共产党对立的国家。同这种理论相反的事实却是，南亚认为，亚洲小国同遥远的美国之间的这些军事联盟是对那个地区的争执的政治干涉。”
    英国的理查德·劳温赛尔也在“观察家报”上说，西方国家的“条约狂”只会降低它们在其他国家人民心目中的威信，特别是因为“苏联在落后国家中实行新的政策所造成的不同的局面”。
    虽然如此，杜勒斯在不久以前还把缔结军事联盟作为美国外交政策的主要方面之一。那末就让杜勒斯之流去发他们的“条约狂”吧。他们所策划的那些侵略性的军事条约是拴不住正在大步走向和平、民主、独立的亚洲人民的脚的。
