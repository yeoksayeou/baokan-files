Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 7th: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting from December 30th last year to January 3rd this year, and passed a resolution on accelerating the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement and agricultural and animal husbandry production.

According to the new development plan, by 1957, the number of farmer households joining cooperatives in the entire autonomous region will reach 75% of the total number of farmer households, and by 1958, semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization will be fully realized. Furthermore, pilot projects for advanced agricultural production cooperatives will be launched in advance. This year, party committees at and above the county level will pilot 72 such cooperatives, striving to basically achieve fully socialist agricultural cooperativization by 1959.

In order to adapt to the needs of the developing situation, the meeting believed that it is necessary to greatly increase the production of grain and cotton, develop animal husbandry, and increase livestock products, requiring that the agricultural production targets for 1957 be reached ahead of schedule this year.

The meeting decided to greatly develop temporary seasonal mutual aid teams, run perennial mutual aid teams well, and also focus on piloting 10 to 15 livestock production cooperatives this year.

　　据新华社乌鲁木齐7日电　中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会在去年12月30日到今年1月3日举行扩大会议，通过了关于加速发展农业合作化运动和农牧业生产的决议。
　　按照新发展计划，到1957年全自治区入社农户将达到农户总数75％，1958年全部实现半社会主义性质的农业合作化；并且提前试办高级农业生产合作社，今年县以上各级党委将试办72个，争取到1959年基本实现完全社会主义性质的农业合作化。
　　为了适应形势发展的需要，会议认为必须大量增产粮食、棉花，发展畜牧业，增加畜产品，要求在今年提前达到1957年的农业生产指标。
    会议决定大量发展临时季节性互助组，办好常年互助组，今年还将重点试办10个到15个牧业生产合作社。
