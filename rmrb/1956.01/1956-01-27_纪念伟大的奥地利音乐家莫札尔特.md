Commemorating the Great Austrian Musician Mozart
    Zhang Hongmo

    "How profound!
    How bold and how symmetrical!"
    These admiring words, spoken by Salieri in Pushkin's little tragedy "Mozart and Salieri," aptly describe the characteristics of Mozart's music. Mozart's music inherited the excellent achievements of 18th-century Western European music and is full of populism and humanistic ideas. Mozart unyieldingly adhered to the principles of realistic art, consistently explored new content and new forms, and made significant reforms in opera. Like other great artists of the Renaissance, Mozart affirmed the beauty of humanity and the harmony of life. Like Goethe, he embodied thought in perfect classical art forms.

    Mozart's musical talent manifested very early and developed very rapidly. At the age of six, he began composing sonatas and started performing tours. His childhood was almost entirely spent on performing tours. As he traveled through Western European countries, he not only increased his knowledge of the world but also gained incomparably rich musical impressions. He extensively studied with the music masters of Western European countries. He once said, "No one has spent as much effort as I have in studying composition. You would be hard-pressed to find a famous musician whose works I have not studied carefully; I not only study them, but I study them repeatedly."

    Munich was a cultural center at the time. Goethe and Schiller's plays were performed there. The cultural atmosphere of Munich made Mozart yearn. But in the 18th century, musicians were still in the position of servants to the court, not only with a lowly status but also required to tailor their writing to the tastes of the powerful. Mozart could not tolerate the arrogance of the nobility, let alone their restrictions on his creative activities. He refused to write music for the nobles. Therefore, he decided to leave Salzburg, his place of livelihood. He said, "One of the main reasons I hate Salzburg is: the vulgarity, contemptibility, and disorganization of the court music... Secondly, music is completely ignored here." Mozart was the first artist to break free from the shackles of a court position. At that time, going to the free market to work meant accepting a fate of poverty; such a decision required full self-confidence and fortitude.

    The Vienna period was of great significance to Mozart's life and work. New musical perceptions, new interactions, and new intellectual activities filled his life during this period. Given the dull and backward state of Austrian society at the time, it was undoubtedly a brave act to choose Beaumarchais's most radical play, "The Marriage of Figaro," which was banned in France and Austria, as the subject of an opera. This opera shows that the morality of Figaro and Susanna, the representatives of the third estate, is higher than that of the nobility, and that the intelligence and strong will of ordinary people triumph over the conspiracies of the feudal aristocracy.

    His other opera, "Don Giovanni," like Goethe's "Faust," reflected the exciting issues of the time: the liberation of individuality, innate feelings, and general moral norms. This was precisely an expression of resistance against the feudal society of the time.

    From the late 1780s, Mozart participated in the activities of the Freemasons in Austria. Although the Freemasons were an organization with vague goals and tasks, they united a part of the progressive social forces. Mozart was attracted to it, apparently because it promoted humanistic ideas of equality and fraternity. Mozart artistically embodied his views and experiences of Freemasonry in the opera "The Magic Flute."

    Mozart loved his country, and he often spoke with indignation about how the nobles lost their national self-esteem and worshiped everything foreign. He had long wanted to write operas in his native language (operas at the time were usually written in Italian). He once said, "If I could bring the drama of my homeland into the realm of music, how the people would love me!" The libretto of the opera "The Magic Flute" was written in his native language.

    In his operatic works, Mozart focused on using music to portray people's psychology and character. He closely integrated drama and music, using music to create typical images comparable to Shakespeare's characters, thus completing the opera reform that Gluck had failed to achieve.

    In the realm of piano music, Mozart's sonatas from his childhood displayed the best, most beautiful, and bright style of the mid-18th century; while his sonatas from his youth already showed Mozart's characteristic depth and sorrow. After a series of experimental works—fantasias—the Fantasy in C minor completely opened up a new path—the path taken by Beethoven and the Romantic composers.

    Mozart's late three symphonies: the brilliant and sincere "Symphony in E-flat Major," the sorrowful "Symphony in G Minor," and the resolute and magnificent "Symphony in C Major" are the three peaks of instrumental music before the 18th-century revolution. Mozart's three quartets dedicated to Haydn also opened up new horizons in the field of chamber music. Mozart's instrumental music is, in a broad sense, programmatic, expressing customs and scenes, poetic fantasies, emotions of joy and sorrow, and dramatic plots.

    Mozart's music has a close connection with the folk music of his own nation. Although he did not directly quote folk tunes like Haydn, his music is full of tunes loved by the people and circulating in folk music.

    Mozart's creative method was realistic. He felt the truly beautiful things in life and artistically reproduced them. His art has profound feelings and perfect form. He saw the contradictions in life, understood people's joys, and knew people's sorrows. But even when expressing the tragedy of life, he drew optimistic conclusions. Because the essence of life is bright, and darkness is only a temporary phenomenon. Mozart refused to cater to the tastes of the feudal ruling class in his writing. His music welcomed the French Revolution and faced the broad masses of the people. This caused him to suffer the revenge of feudal society. He was often in poverty, and finally, because of poverty and illness, he died at the young age of 35 (in 1791) when his creative power was at its peak.

    For 200 years, the brilliance of Mozart's art has become more and more splendid. However, some bourgeois critics have ulterior motives in saying that Mozart's style is the style of aristocratic culture; saying that Mozart was a thoughtless, carefree, leisurely person whose creation depended entirely on genius; thereby obliterating the populism of Mozart's art. Mozart was a heroic warrior with a gentle exterior and a resilient fighting spirit within. In the dark period of Austria, he dared to challenge feudal society, embodying the people's ideals of freedom and their hopes for a life of equality and happiness in his music. He left us a rich cultural heritage. Today, we commemorate the 200th anniversary of his birth. His pure and optimistic music is inspiring us to strive for a better future and for the early arrival of a peaceful and happy life for all mankind. (Attached picture)

    纪念伟大的奥地利音乐家莫札尔特
    张洪模
    “多么深刻！
    多么大胆和多么匀称！”
    普希金在他的小悲剧“莫札尔特与萨尔耶利”中借萨尔耶利的口说出的这些赞叹的话，正说明了莫札尔特的音乐的特点。莫札尔特的音乐继承了18世纪西欧音乐的优秀成果，充满了人民性和人道主义思想。莫札尔特不屈不挠地坚持着现实主义艺术原则，始终不渝地探求新内容和新形式，在歌剧方面有着重大的改革。莫札尔特像文艺复兴时代其他伟大的艺术家一样，肯定人类的美好和生活的和谐。他像歌德一样把思想体现在古典的完美艺术形式里。
    莫札尔特的音乐才能表现得非常早，而且发展得非常迅速。他六岁的时候便开始作奏鸣曲，并且开始了演出旅行。他的童年几乎完全是在演出旅行中度过的。当他沿着西欧各国旅行的时候，不仅增长了他对世界的见识，而且获得了无比丰富的音乐印象。他广泛地向西欧各国的音乐大师们学习，他曾说过：“谁也没有像我在研究作曲上花费过这样多的劳力。你很难找出一位著名的音乐家的作品我没有用心研究过；我不仅研究，而且是反复地研究”。
    慕尼黑是当时的文化中心。歌德和席勒的戏剧都在那里演出。慕尼黑的文化生活气氛使莫札尔特心神向往。但在18世纪的时候，音乐家还都处于宫廷的奴仆的地位，不仅地位卑贱，而且写作都要迎合权贵们的口味。莫札尔特不能容忍贵族的傲慢无礼，更不能容忍贵族们对他的创作活动的限制，他拒绝为贵族们写音乐。因此，他决心离开他的糊口之地查尔茨堡。他说：“使我痛恨查尔茨堡的主要原因之一是：宫廷音乐的粗俗、可鄙和杂乱无章……其次，音乐在这里完全不受重视”。莫札尔特是第一位挣脱掉宫廷职位的锁链的艺术家。在当时，到自由市场上去工作就是去接受贫困的命运，这样的决心是要有充分的自信力和刚毅精神的。
    在维也纳时期，对于莫札尔特的生活和创作有很大的意义。新的音乐观感、新的交往、新的知识界的活动充满了他这一时期的生活。在当时奥地利社会的沉闷落后的情况下，他选了在法国和奥地利被禁止的博玛舍的最激进的剧本“费加罗的婚礼”为歌剧题材，这不能不说是勇敢的行为。这部歌剧表现了第三阶级的代表人物费加罗和苏珊娜的道德高于贵族，普通人的聪明头脑和坚强的意志战胜了封建贵族的阴谋。
    他的另一部歌剧“唐·璜”的题材正像歌德的“浮士德”一样，反映了当时激动人心的问题：个性的解放、天赋的感情和一般道德规范问题。这正是反抗当时封建社会的一种表现。
    从18世纪80年代后半期起，莫札尔特参加了奥地利的共济会的活动。共济会虽然是一个目的和任务都很模糊的组织，但是团结了一部分进步社会力量。莫札尔特所以受它吸引，显然是由于它宣传平等友爱的人道主义思想。莫札尔特把他对共济会的看法和体验都用艺术手法体现在歌剧“魔笛”里了。
    莫札尔特热爱自己的祖国，他常带着激愤的心情谈到贵族们怎样丧失民族自尊心，崇拜一切外国事物。他早就有用本国语言写歌剧的愿望（当时的歌剧脚本通常都是用意大利文写的），他曾说：“我如果能把祖国的戏剧搬进音乐领域，人民该多么敬爱我啊！”歌剧“魔笛”的脚本就是用他的祖国语言写的。
    莫札尔特在歌剧的创作中，把注意力集中在用音乐刻划人的心理和性格方面。他使戏剧和音乐紧密地结合起来，用音乐创造出同莎士比亚的人物相媲美的典型形象，这样他便完成了格路克所未能做到的歌剧改革。
    在钢琴音乐领域里，莫札尔特童年时代的奏鸣曲，表现了18世纪中最好的、优美明朗的风格；而他青年时代的奏鸣曲就已经表现了莫札尔特所特有的深刻和哀愁。经过一系列的实验作品——幻想曲以后，到C小调幻想曲就完全开辟了一条新的道路——贝多芬和浪漫派作曲家走的道路。
    莫札尔特的晚期的三部交响曲：光辉真挚的“降E大调交响曲”、充满悲哀情绪的“G小调交响曲”、刚毅壮丽的“C大调交响曲”是18世纪革命前器乐的三座顶峰。莫札尔特献给海顿的三部四重奏曲在室内乐领域中也开辟了新境界。莫札尔特的器乐广义地说是标题性的，其中表现了风俗情景，诗意的幻想，悲欢离合的情绪，戏剧的情节。
    莫札尔特的音乐和他自己民族的民间音乐有着血肉的联系。虽然他不像海顿一样直接引用民间曲调，但是他的音乐充满了人民所喜爱的、在民间流传的音调。
    莫札尔特的创作方法是现实主义的。他感受了生活中真正美的东西，并且艺术地把它再现出来。他的艺术具有深刻的感情，同时又具有完美的形式。他看到了生活里的矛盾，懂得人的欢乐，也知道人的悲苦。但即使在表现生活的悲剧的时候，他也得出乐观的结论。因为生活的本质是光明的，黑暗只是暂时的现象。莫札尔特拒绝迎合封建统治阶级的口味写作，他的音乐迎接了法国的大革命，面向广大人民群众。这就使他遭受到封建社会的报复。他经常处于贫困境况，最后，因为贫病交迫，在创作力正旺盛的35岁（1791年）便去世了。
    200年来，莫札尔特的艺术的光辉愈来愈辉煌。但是某些资产阶级的评论家却别有用心地说莫札尔特的风格是贵族文化的风格；说莫札尔特是一个无思想、无忧无虑、闲散的、创作全凭天才的人；从而抹杀莫札尔特的艺术的人民性。莫札尔特是一位外表温和而内中蕴藏着韧性战斗精神的英勇战士。他在奥地利的黑暗时期胆敢向封建社会挑战，以自己的音乐体现了人民的自由理想和对平等幸福的生活的希望。他给我们留下了丰富的文化遗产。今天，我们纪念他的诞生200周年，他的纯洁的、充满乐观情绪的音乐，正鼓舞着我们争取更美好的未来，争取全人类和平幸福的生活早日到来。（附图片）
