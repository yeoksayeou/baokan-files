    The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory’s clinic has learned from the advanced experience of Soviet industrial and mining enterprises in health work, and implemented a workshop doctor system. Doctors regularly go to the workshops to understand the workers' labor conditions and take various measures to protect the workers' health, which has played a significant role in ensuring the completion of production tasks. This is workshop doctor Wang Yinong (right) learning about the workers' labor conditions in the workshop.
