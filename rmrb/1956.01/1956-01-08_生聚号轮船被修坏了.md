    The "Shengju" Ship Was Damaged During Repair
　　To the Editor:
    In June 1955, the Hankou branch of the joint state-private Min Sheng Shipping Company sent the "Shengju" ship to the No. 1 Ship Repair Factory of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration for repairs. According to the plan, twenty large new iron plates should have been replaced on the ship. However, the No. 1 Ship Repair Factory cut corners by using small iron plates instead, and the riveting was not up to standard. As a result, a large amount of water leaked into the cabin during the first trial run. Instead of trying to remedy the situation, the repair factory resorted to deceptive measures, painting the cabin to conceal many substandard areas. Consequently, when the "Shengju" ship left the factory on September 30, the cabin was flooded with water. The factory then used eleven bags of cement to barely seal the leaks. Afterwards, the Hankou branch of the Min Sheng Shipping Company repeatedly raised concerns about the substandard repair quality, but the repair factory turned a deaf ear and ignored them.
    After the repairs, the quality of the "Shengju" ship deteriorated instead. Due to the extended repair period, transportation was delayed by two months, resulting in a loss of at least 140,000 yuan in freight revenue for the Hankou branch of the Min Sheng Shipping Company.

    生聚号轮船被修坏了
　　编辑同志：
    1955年6月间，公私合营民生轮船公司汉口分公司把生聚号轮船送到长江航运管理局第一船舶修理厂修理。按照计划，这艘船应该换大块的新铁板二十块，但是第一船舶修理厂却偷工减料，用小块的铁板代替，而且铆得也不合规格。因此，这艘船在第一次试车的时候，舱里就漏进了大量的水。修理厂不但没有设法补救，反而采用了欺骗手段，把船舱涂上油漆，使得许多不合规格的地方都看不出来。结果到9月30日生聚轮出厂的时候，舱内大量进水。厂方又用了十一袋水泥，才勉强堵住了漏水的地方。事后，民生轮船公司汉口分公司对修船质量不合规格的问题几次提出意见，修理厂却装聋作哑，置之不理。
    生聚轮经过修理以后，质量反而更坏了。由于轮船修理期限延长了，耽误了两个月运输，使民生轮船公司汉口分公司收入的运费至少减少了14万元。
