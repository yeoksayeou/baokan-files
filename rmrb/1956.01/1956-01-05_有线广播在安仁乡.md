Wired Broadcasting in Anren Township
    Wang Ru

    In June 1954, radio operators from Dayi County, Sichuan Province, returned from studies in Chengdu and, based on the conditions at the time, decided to establish a small rural broadcasting station in Anren Township. Construction began in July and was basically completed by the end of August. Currently, the broadcasting station has a 150-watt amplifier, has erected about 150 li of wiring, and installed 168 half-watt small loudspeakers in more than one hundred natural villages.

    The broadcasting station broadcasts major domestic and international events to the people every day, significant achievements in the construction of the motherland, the completion and over-fulfillment of production plans by workers and peasants, speeches on rural policies, and many literary and artistic programs loved by the people. Broadcasting has made the lives of the people in Anren Township richer and more colorful.

    Anren Township began establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives in the spring of 1954. At that time, only one cooperative was established on a trial basis. By the autumn harvest of 1955, the entire township had basically achieved cooperativization. The first established Five-Star Agricultural Producers' Cooperative is now preparing to become an advanced cooperative. The county has also decided to establish an agricultural machinery station in Anren Town. The agricultural cooperativization movement has developed so rapidly in Anren Township, which is inseparable from the work of the broadcasting station.

    The broadcasting station broadcasts for two and a half hours every day. In addition to rebroadcasting various programs from the Central and Sichuan People's Broadcasting Stations, it also holds about one hour of self-produced programs. The self-produced programs include policy speeches, local news, speeches by advanced figures and representative figures, etc. In its self-produced programs, the broadcasting station has successfully used the form of broadcast rallies to promote work. In the work of unified purchase and sales, the broadcasting station, in accordance with the deployment of local leading organs, held a broadcast rally, organized the masses to listen under the loudspeakers, and launched discussions, so that the peasants throughout the township universally further recognized the benefits of unified purchase and sales and drew a clear line with the rich peasants. At a discussion meeting in Gonghe Village, 23 peasants exposed the sabotage activities of the rich peasants. The "Broadcast Rally for the Signature Campaign Against the Use of Atomic Weapons" in March 1955 had 11,430 people listening to the broadcast under the loudspeakers and participating in the signature campaign, accounting for 87.7% of the total population of the township. The broadcasting station also regularly publicizes the party's cooperativization policies and the experiences of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, promoting the work of establishing cooperatives and the movement to increase production. The Five-Star Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, the earliest established in the township, had its experience in increasing production disseminated by the broadcasting station in a timely manner for the peasants throughout the township to learn. At the same time, the broadcasting station is also a tool for local leading organs to lead peasants in carrying out labor competitions. In early July 1955, the broadcasting station broadcast a letter from all members of the Five-Star Agricultural Producers' Cooperative to all agricultural producers' cooperatives in the township, initiating a competition with other cooperatives and the peasants throughout the township to complete the township's manure accumulation task, making the township's manure accumulation movement develop in full swing and over-fulfilling the manure accumulation task. In addition, the broadcasting station also frequently conducts ideological education for peasants, making broadcasting a promoter of new moral customs. In terms of enlivening the cultural and recreational life of the countryside, in addition to broadcasting literary and artistic programs from the Central and Sichuan Provincial People's Broadcasting Stations, the broadcasting station also has more than 400 records and maintains close contact with rural art enthusiasts, schools, and agricultural producers' cooperative clubs.

    Now, when the peasants of Anren Township, after a day of hard work, sit under the loudspeakers in the evening and hear the news of socialist construction all over the country, they feel greatly encouraged and deeply experience the happy life they have obtained under the leadership of the Communist Party. They say, socialism is by our side, and a happy life has begun.

　　有线广播在安仁乡
    王茹
    1954年6月间，四川省大邑县收音员从成都学习回来，根据当时的条件决定在安仁乡建立一座小型的农村广播站。7月间开始建站，8月底基本建成。目前，广播站有150瓦的扩音机一部，架设了约150里长的电线网，在一百多个自然村的范围内安装了168个半瓦的小喇叭。
    广播站每天向人们播送国内外大事，祖国建设的重大成就，工人农民完成和超额完成生产计划的情况，农村政策讲话，以及许多为人们所喜爱的文学艺术节目。广播使安仁乡人们的生活更丰富多采了。
    安仁乡从1954年春天开始建立农业生产合作社，那时，只试办了一个社。1955年秋收前全乡已经基本实现了合作化。最先办起的五星农业生产合作社现在正准备办成高级社。县里还决定在安仁镇成立一座农业机器站。农业合作化运动在安仁乡发展得这样快，是和广播站的工作分不开的。
    广播站每天播音时间二小时半，除转播中央和四川人民广播电台的各种节目以外，还举办了约一小时的自办节目。自办节目有政策讲话、本地新闻、先进人物和代表人物的演讲等。广播站在自办的节目中，比较成功地运用了广播大会的形式，推动了工作。在统购统销工作中，广播站根据当地领导机关的部署，举行了一次广播大会，组织群众在喇叭下收听，并且展开讨论，使全乡农民普遍进一步认识了统购统销的好处，同富农划清了界限。在共和村的一个讨论会上就有23个农民揭露了富农的破坏活动。1955年3月的一次“反对使用原子武器签名运动广播大会”，在喇叭下收听广播并且参加签名的就有11，430人，占全乡总人数的87.7％。广播站还经常宣传党的合作化政策和先进农业生产合作社的经验，推动建社工作和增产运动。全乡办得最早的五星农业生产合作社，广播站及时传播了它的增产经验，让全乡农民学习。同时，广播站又是当地领导机关领导农民开展劳动竞赛的工具。1955年7月初，广播站播送了五星农业生产合作社全体社员给全乡所有农业生产合作社的一封信，为完成全乡的积肥任务向其他合作社和全乡农民发起竞赛，使全乡积肥运动热火朝天地开展起来，超额完成了积肥任务。此外，广播站还经常对农民进行思想教育，使广播成为新道德风气的提倡者。在活跃农村的文化娱乐生活方面，除了播送中央及四川省人民广播电台的文学艺术节目以外，广播站还有四百多张唱片，并且同农村的文艺爱好者、学校以及农业生产合作社俱乐部等保持着密切的联系。
    现在，当安仁乡的农民们每天辛勤劳动过后，晚上坐在广播喇叭下听到全国各地社会主义建设的消息的时候，他们感受到极大的鼓舞，并且深深地体验着共产党领导他们所获得的幸福的生活。他们说，社会主义靠边了，幸福生活开头了。
