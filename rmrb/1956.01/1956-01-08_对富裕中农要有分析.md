There should be analysis of rich middle peasants
Lu Hanzhang, a rich middle peasant from the Wua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shilong Township, Leshan County, Sichuan Province, has been a member of the cooperative for a year. In production, he has consistently obeyed arrangements, but sometimes likes to say playful things. During the small spring harvest in the first half of 1955, his wife privately took some wheat from the cooperative. The cooperative cadres criticized this matter; Lu Hanzhang had said he wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. But after education, he dispelled the idea of withdrawing. In the autumn, after the cooperative movement greatly developed, he worked even more actively.

However, the township head of this township did not make specific analysis, and believed that all rich middle peasants were not determined to run cooperatives; Lu Hanzhang had said he wanted to withdraw from the cooperative in the past, which proved that he was not determined to join the cooperative. Based on this understanding, the township head wanted the Wua Cooperative's director to persuade Lu Hanzhang to withdraw from the cooperative. Lu Hanzhang said that he had no thought of withdrawing and did not want to withdraw, but the township head and the cooperative director did not listen.

Analyzing Lu Hanzhang's specific situation, how can it be said that he is not determined to join the cooperative? The practice of the Shilong Township head and the Wua Cooperative director in persuading Lu Hanzhang to withdraw from the cooperative is wrong.

    对富裕中农要有分析
    四川省乐山县石龙乡五爱农业生产合作社的社员老富裕中农卢汉章，入社已经一年了。在生产上他一贯服从调配，只是有时爱说点调皮话。1955年上半年收小春时，他的妻子私自拿了社里一点麦子。社干部对这件事提出批评；卢汉章曾说过要退社。但是经过教育，他就把退社的念头打消了。秋天，合作化运动大发展起来以后，他劳动更积极。
    可是，这个乡的乡长不做具体的分析，笼统地认为凡是富裕中农办社都不坚决；卢汉章过去说过要退社，就证明他入社不坚决。根据这种认识，这个乡长就要五爱社社长动员卢汉章退社。卢汉章说自己没有退社思想，不愿意退社，乡长、社长都不听。
    分析卢汉章的具体情况，怎能说他入社不坚决呢？石龙乡乡长和五爱社社长动员卢汉章退社的做法是错误的。
