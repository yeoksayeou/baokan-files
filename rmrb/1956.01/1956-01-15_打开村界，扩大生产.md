Opening village boundaries, expanding production

The terrain of Wanbao Village in Mulan County, Heilongjiang Province, is too low-lying, so crops never grow well. This area can be irrigated to grow rice; however, Wanbao Village does not have enough manpower to start construction. Last year, when planning production, they joined forces with the neighboring villages of Sanyi, Shaoguo, and two other villages to operate together and transform the land into paddy fields. For the sake of operational convenience, they also exchanged another part of the low-lying land with Sanyi and Shaoguo villages for rice cultivation.

This method of joint operation has been endorsed by the local farmers. This method of joint operation by several villages is also constantly emerging elsewhere. For example, in the Ninth District of Hulan County, 10 villages pooled funds to build water conservancy projects and switch to rice cultivation; Kouzi Village and Donggangzi Village in Hulan County also joined forces to buy water pumps for irrigation. These are all good ways to expand production.

    打开村界，扩大生产
    黑龙江省木兰县万宝村地势太洼，老是长不好庄稼。这块地方可以引进水来种水稻；只是万宝村人力不足，没法动工。去年规划生产的时候，他们便同近邻的三义、烧锅等4个村子联合起来经营，把这里的土地改造成水田。为了经营上的方便，还把另外一部分低洼地换给三义、烧锅两个村种水稻。
    这种联合经营的办法，得到当地农民的拥护。这种几个村子联合经营的办法，在别处也不断出现。像呼兰县第九区就有10个村集资兴修水利，改种水田；呼兰县口子村和东岗子村也联合起来买抽水机浇地。这都是扩大生产的好办法。
