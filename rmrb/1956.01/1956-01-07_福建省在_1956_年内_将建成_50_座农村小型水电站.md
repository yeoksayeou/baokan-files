    Fujian Province to Build 50 Small Rural Hydropower Stations in 1956
    Fujian Province plans to build 50 small rural hydroelectric power stations this year, with a total power generation capacity of 1,000 kilowatts. Among them, the Fenggang Hydropower Station in Tong'an County and a hydropower station in Nanping County have already started construction. The Fenggang Hydropower Station uses the water source from the Cezao irrigation canal, which was completed last spring, to generate electricity. The Houwu Reservoir in Hui'an County and the Dongmen Reservoir in Fuqing County, which are also under construction, are also preparing to build small hydropower stations.
    Fujian Province has a dense network of streams, steep terrain, and abundant water resources. Since liberation, the province has built eight new hydroelectric power stations and renovated and repaired 13 hydroelectric power stations. Many towns and cities already have inexpensive electricity for oil extraction, sugar making, paper making, and lighting. Some farmers in mountainous areas have also started using electric lights.

    福建省在1956年内
    将建成50座农村小型水电站
    福建省计划在今年建成50座农村小型水力发电站，总发电量为一千瓩。其中同安县凤岗水电站和南平县的一座水力发电站已经动工兴建。凤岗水电站是利用去年春天完工的策糟灌溉渠的水源发电的。正在兴建的惠安县后吴水库和福清县东门水库，也都准备修建小型水电站。　　福建省境内溪流密布，地势倾斜，水力资源十分丰富。解放以后，全省新建了八座水电站，改建和整修了13座水电站。不少城镇已经有了廉价的电力，用来榨油、制糖、造纸和照明。有的山区农民也用上了电灯。
