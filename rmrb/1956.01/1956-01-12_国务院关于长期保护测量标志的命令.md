Page: 2

The various survey markers established by surveying agencies throughout the country play an important role in national construction and must be properly protected. To this end, the following orders are hereby issued:

I. Permanent survey markers (including wooden markers, steel markers, center marker stones for triangulation points, center marker stones for astronomical points and baseline points, leveling markers and leveling marker stones, fixed markers for topographic mapping, etc.) constructed and buried during surveying work (triangulation, leveling, astronomical, topographic, etc.) should be regarded as national property and buildings, and people's committees at all levels and all the people have the responsibility to protect them.

II. Surveying agencies should, in conjunction with local people's committees (mainly township people's committees or district offices), sign a survey marker entrustment agreement in places where survey markers are located, entrusting the local people's committees to be responsible for the protection of permanent survey markers constructed and buried by the surveying agencies themselves.

III. Local people's committees should accept the various survey markers they have taken over in accordance with the items filled in on the survey marker entrustment agreement, and strictly implement the protection responsibilities. In addition to regularly educating the masses to cherish and inspect the markers, they should conduct detailed inspections once or twice a year. If any damage, movement, or impairment of the markers is discovered, the cause should be investigated and the entrusted surveying agency should be notified in a timely manner for handling.

IV. If the surveying agency that originally entrusted the custody of the constructed survey markers needs to dismantle or move them for any reason, it must have a formal letter from the agency as proof. The personnel in charge of dismantling or moving the survey markers should note the specific circumstances and date of the dismantling or movement on the original survey marker entrustment agreement, and sign and seal it.

V. The land within a certain area where survey markers are constructed or buried (generally, purchase procedures have been completed) cannot be used for other purposes. If it is necessary to rebuild or demolish buildings (such as clock towers, churches, temples, factory chimneys, water towers, bridges, etc.) with permanent national triangulation points or leveling points and other survey markers, the original entrusted surveying agency must be notified in advance, and its consent must be obtained before rebuilding or demolishing can be carried out.

VI. Those who steal or intentionally destroy permanent national survey markers should be punished according to law, depending on the severity of the circumstances.

VII. Surveying personnel from government and military surveying agencies who hold formal certificates may use the survey markers through the agency that took over the survey markers, but they must ensure that they are intact and undamaged, and after use, they should be inspected together with the original receiving agency.

    一、在进行测量工作（三角、水准、天文、地形等）中所建造和埋设的永久性测量标志（包括木标、钢标、三角点中心标石、天文点和基线点的中心标石、水准标志与水准标石、地形测图的固定标志等）应该视为国家的财产和建筑物，地方各级人民委员会和全国人民都有保护的责任。
    二、测量机关在设有测量标志的地方应该会同当地的地方人民委员会（主要是乡人民委员会或者区公所）共同签订测量标志委托保管书，将自己所建造和埋设的永久性测量标志，交由地方人民委员会负责保护。
    三、各地方人民委员会对所接管的各种测量标志，应该按照测量标志委托保管书中填写的项目接收，并严格执行保护责任。除经常教育群众爱护检查外，要每年作一至二次详细的检查，如果发现标志有被破坏、移动或损坏的时候，应该追查原因，并及时通知委托保管的测量机关处理。
    四、所造测量标志如原委托保管的测量机关因故需要拆卸或移动的时候，必须有该机关的正式函件证明。经办拆卸或者移动测量标志的负责人员应该将拆卸或者移动的具体情况和日期在原测量标志委托保管书上注明，并且签名盖章。
    五、建造或者埋设测量标志的一定面积内的土地（一般均已办理购让手续），不能再作其他使用，如果有必要改建或者拆毁设有全国永久性的三角点、水准点的建筑物（如钟楼、教堂、寺院、工厂烟囱、水塔、桥梁等）及其他测量标志的时候，必须预先通知原委托保管的测量机关，并且得到它的同意，方可进行改建或者拆毁。
    六、盗窃或者有意破坏国家的永久性测量标志的，应该按照情节的轻重依法惩办。
    七、凡是持有正式证件的政府和军队的测量机关的测量人员，都可以通过接管测量标志的机关使用该项标志，但是必须保证其完好无损，并且在使用以后，应该会同原接管机关进行查验。
