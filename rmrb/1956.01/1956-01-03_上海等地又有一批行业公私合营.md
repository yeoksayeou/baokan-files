　　Proper arrangements have been made for both capitalist personnel holding substantive positions and workers in the industries that have officially implemented joint state-private ownership. A number of capitalist personnel holding substantive positions and workers in the four industries in Tianjin that implemented joint state-private ownership on the 31st were assigned to municipal and district-level management organizations in their respective industries to serve as managers, directors, and other positions. Many of the original private shop managers and deputy managers in the three industries of silk fabric, etc., in Wuhan are now serving as directors or deputy directors of joint state-private enterprises.

　　The leadership organizations of these joint state-private industries were also established simultaneously with the official joint venture. The Shanghai Paint and Dye Professional Companies, the Tianjin Joint State-Private Vegetable Wholesale General Store, the New Medicine General Store, and the Cotton Cloth and Tea Joint State-Private Management Offices were all officially established on December 31.
