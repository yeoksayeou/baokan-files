Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th - The 37 private industrial sectors in Tianjin that have been approved for joint state-private ownership have today established industry-based asset verification teams, which will soon begin asset verification work. The district committees of the Chinese Communist Party, the district federations of industry and commerce, and trade union offices have organized more than 16,000 cadres, workers, and capitalists to study the relevant policies, plans, and standards for asset verification.

In order to speed up the transformation work and give play to the enthusiasm of the capitalists, this asset verification work will be carried out by the capitalists themselves filling out forms, making self-assessments, self-verifying, and self-reporting, with workers providing assistance and supervision, and finally reviewed, balanced, and approved by the various responsible industrial bureaus.
