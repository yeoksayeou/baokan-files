    In the Yumen Oilfield Mining Area
    By Our Correspondent Kang Weizhong

    When you enter the southern mining area of the Yumen Oilfield, you will see many oil derricks standing on the vast ground. Beneath the derricks, the crude oil and natural gas gushing from the wells below flow through a network of large and small steel pipelines to the oil selection stations. A spiderweb-like network of roads closely connects each oil well and oil selection station. Fast-moving vehicles transport workers and various equipment to the oil wells and oil selection stations. At night, standing on the platform, you will see the electric lights hanging on the tall derricks, shining like the stars in the clear night sky, illuminating this sleepless oil city. Here, oil workers extract the blood of the motherland's industrialization – petroleum – from the depths of the earth day and night.

    I came to this beautiful mining area. Comrades told me that before liberation, the oil mine's production was in a state of stagnation for a long time. In order to make more money, the Kuomintang only drilled some wells at the top of the oil field and used methods to maximize oil production, causing the oil layer pressure at the top of the oil field to drop rapidly, which caused a large amount of natural gas to overflow, greatly weakening the self-spraying ability of the oil wells and seriously damaging the national resources. By the eve of liberation, only a small number of oil production wells and oil selection stations had been built here, and 30% of the oil wells could no longer produce. After liberation, the Party and the government attached great importance to the restoration and reconstruction of this oil field. With the help of Soviet experts, we completed the restoration of abandoned wells in 1952 and improved the management of production wells. In 1953, large-scale construction began in the mining area. Now, the number of newly put into production oil wells is equivalent to 245% of 1952, and equivalent to 305% of the number of oil wells before liberation. The newly built oil selection stations are also more numerous than those built in the 11 years before liberation. From 1953 to August 1955, the crude oil delivered to the state by the oil workers was equal to 218.7% of the production volume from 1950 to 1952; equal to 139.69% of the production volume in the 11 years before liberation.

    After a personal investigation and research by a working group led by Academician Trafimuk of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, it was determined that the nature of this oil field is a good water-drive oil field (that is, using the power of water to drive crude oil to spray from the bottom of the well). The experts also helped formulate new mining plans such as water injection at the edge of the oil field and gas injection at the top. According to this plan, the basic construction of water injection at the edge of the oil field began in July 1954. With the help of Soviet geological experts and hydrogeological experts, dozens of water injection wells have been drilled at the edge of the oil field, and several water injection plants have been built. The amount of water injected in the third quarter of last year was three times the amount of water injected in the first half of the year. After a large amount of water injection, the crude oil production of the production wells at the edge of the oil field has generally increased significantly.

    Injecting gas at the top of the oil field can restore the oil layer pressure, extend the self-spraying period of the oil wells, increase the crude oil recovery rate and maintain lower crude oil costs. After a new gas injection plant was built last year, the amount of gas injected has increased about ten times compared with the original gas injection plant. In completing production tasks, the workers have put forward many rationalization proposals. Comrade Liu Gongzhi, who has won the title of labor model for three consecutive years, led the members of the well repair team to repair the German dual-purpose giant drilling rig that had been scrapped for 11 years, increasing the equipment strength for well repair during his tenure as the technical deputy captain of the well repair brigade. After he was transferred to the deputy captain of the first comprehensive oil production zone team of the oil production plant, he and the technicians improved the well cleaning machine and used it to replace the drilling rig, which not only saved the drilling rig but also improved efficiency. Comrade Jiao Baohua, a technician, modified the wax scraper winch used for cleaning wax in oil wells into an electric winch, which saved manpower and material resources, reduced the physical labor of workers, and also ensured safe operation and wax removal quality. Now the oil production plant is preparing to modify and promote 15 more units, which will save the country 150,000 yuan annually. The oil production workers also created an wellhead relief pressure cylinder, which can automatically transport the accumulated oil at the wellhead to the oil selection station, ensuring the cleanliness of the well area.

    This year, the oil production plant will produce more oil for the country. According to the plan, crude oil production will increase by 36% compared with 1955, and the amount of water injected at the edge of the oil field will also increase by 2.5 times. As the amount of water injected at the edge of the oil field increases, the salt and water content of the extracted crude oil will also increase accordingly. If the salt and water content of crude oil is high, it will corrode the oil refining equipment. In order to solve this problem, a new crude oil electric desalting plant has been built in the oil production plant.

    Preparations for large-scale crude oil exploitation in the future are also underway. In 1955, the drilling workers of the Laojunmiao Oilfield concentrated their efforts on drilling two oil layers that had not been extensively exploited in the past, and now they have basically grasped the oil layer area and oil reserves. From the current test mining of drilling wells, generally they can self-spray oil, and the output is also very high. In the future, after full-scale oil extraction, it can not only increase the crude oil production of the Yumen Oilfield, but also reduce the burden on the currently mainly exploited oil layer and extend the self-spraying life of this oil well. In addition, new oil layers have also been discovered under the north flank fault of the oil field.

    在玉门油矿采油区
    本报记者  康伟中
    当你走进玉门油矿南边的采油区的时候，就会看见许多矗立在广阔的地面上的石油井架。在井架的下部，那些从井底下涌出来的原油和天然气，顺着纵横交错的大大小小的钢制输油管流往选油站去。蛛网般的公路把每一个油井和选油站紧密地连接起来。飞驰的汽车把工人和各种器材运到油井和选油站。入夜，立在坪台上眺望，将看到那悬挂在高大井架上的电灯，像晴朗夜空的繁星，闪闪烁烁地照耀着这座不眠的石油城。在这里，采油工人日日夜夜地把祖国工业化的血液——石油，从地底下开采出来。
    我来到了这个美丽的采油区。同志们告诉我，在解放以前，油矿的生产长期陷于不死不活的境地。国民党为了多赚钱，仅在油田顶部打一些井，并且用尽量出油的办法，使油田顶部油层压力迅速下降，从而使大量的天然气外溢，大大削弱了油井的自喷能力，严重地破坏了国家资源。到解放前夕，这里仅仅建设了为数很少的采油井和选油站，其中有30％的油井已经不能生产了。解放后，党和政府十分重视这个油田的恢复重建工作。在苏联专家的帮助下，在1952年，我们就完成了废井的恢复工作，并改善了生产井的管理。1953年，采油区又开始了大规模的建设。现在，新投入生产的油井数目相当于1952年的245％，相当于解放前油井数的305％。新建选油站也比解放前11年所建设的多。从1953年到1955年8月，采油工人交给国家的原油，等于1950年到1952年三年间生产量的218.7％；等于解放前11年生产量的139.69％。
    经过以苏联科学院院士特拉费母克为首的工作组亲自调查研究，确定这个油田的性质是属于优良的水驱油田（即用水的力量驱动原油从井底喷出）。专家们还帮助制定了油田边缘注水、顶部注气等新的开采方案。根据这个方案，已经在1954年7月开始了油田边缘注水工程的基本建设。在苏联地质专家和水文地质专家的帮助下，已经在油田边缘钻凿了数十个注水井，建设了几座注水厂。去年第三季度的注水量等于上半年注水量的三倍。大量注水以后，油田边缘的生产井的原油产量，一般都有显著提高。
    在油田顶部注气，可以恢复油层压力，延长油井自喷期限，增加原油采收率和保持较低的原油成本。去年新建一座注气厂后，注气量已比原有注气厂增大十倍左右。在完成生产任务中，工人们提出了许多合理化建议。三年来连获劳动模范称号的刘公之同志，在他担任修井大队技术副大队长期间，曾领导修井队的队员把报废达11年之久的德国两用巨大钻机修好，增加了修井的设备力量。在他调任采油厂第一综合采油区队副队长后，又和技术员一起，改进通井机，用它来代替钻机，既节省了钻机，又提高了效率。技术员焦宝华同志，把油井清腊所用的刮腊片绞车改装成电动绞车，节省了人力、物力，减轻了工人的体力劳动，还保证了安全操作和清腊质量。现在采油厂准备再改装推广15部，每年将为国家节约资金15万元。采油工人们还创造了井口放空压力缸，可以自动地把井口的积油输送到选油站去，保证了井区清洁。
    今年，采油厂将为国家生产更多的石油。按照计划原油生产将比1955年增加36％，油田边缘注水量也将增加2.5倍。随着油田边缘注水量增加，所采原油含盐含水量也相应增加。原油含盐含水量高了，就要腐蚀炼油设备。为了解决这个问题，已经在采油厂新建了一座原油电力脱盐厂。
    为今后大规模开采原油的准备工作也在进行中，1955年，老君庙油田的钻井工作者集中力量钻探了过去未曾大量开采的两个油层，现在已经基本掌握了油层面积和储油量。从目前钻探井试验采油的情况来看，一般都能自喷出油，产量也很高。将来全面采油后，不仅可以提高玉门油矿的原油产量，而且还可以减轻目前主要开采的油层的负担，延长这层油井的自喷寿命。另外，在油田的北翼断层下面还发现了新的油层。
