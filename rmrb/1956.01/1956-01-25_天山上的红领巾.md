    Red Scarves on the Tianshan Mountains
    储安平
    When I visited the new city of Shihezi, I took a day to tour the Tianshan Mountains. We slowly circled upwards, one bend after another, to cross the Dazi Temple Peak. As the car climbed higher and higher, the scenery before us became more and more expansive and magnificent. Looking north, we saw the vast plain of the Manas River basin, which was created as an outstanding cotton-producing area of our country only after liberation, stretching out at our feet, now a misty expanse. Our country's land is boundless and endless, and our country's treasures are inexhaustible and infinite. However, such beautiful and lovely land was barren for years in the past. Now history has changed. On this vast and fertile plain, tractors are starting to make rough sounds in the quiet wilderness, and the soil is constantly emitting a fragrant breath under the nourishment of river water. The area of grain fields and cotton fields is expanding year by year. Before long, a railway will pass through this land. The railway will be like a blood-transfusion needle, and when it is inserted into this land that has been depleted for many years, it will make this land even more vibrant.
    When we finally reached the summit of Dazi Temple Peak, another huge and soul-stirring picture appeared before me. Ah, this is the Tianshan Mountains! When I was in elementary school, I heard about "Tianshan"; how many people in China already knew that there was a "Tianshan" in China when they were very young! And now, I finally stood before it for the first time. Although there were still several kilometers of shallow valleys and slopes separating the peak of Dazi Temple from the opposite mountain range, the open shallow valley not only did not dilute the depth of the opposite mountain range, but seemed to especially set off its heroic and solid nature. The mountains were covered with spruce trees, which were graceful and dignified in color, and behind the mountain range covered with spruce trees were layers of snow-capped mountains, connecting with the clouds. Some yurts were scattered in the shallow valley. The yurts looked like only white dots from a distance, and these white dots in turn set off the depth, vastness, and tranquility of the mountains and forests.
    We crossed the peak and soon arrived at the forest farm. The Tianshan Mountains can generally be divided into three zones. The uppermost part is called the snow line, and the middle part is called the forest zone. From Qitai westward to Yili, stretching for thousands of miles, grows this graceful, tall, and straight spruce. The trees of the Tianshan Mountains only grow on the shady side of the mountain, not on the sunny side; they do not grow on the top of the mountain or at the foot of the mountain, only on the mountainside. In the densest part of the forest area, there are more than 1,600 trees per square kilometer. This rich timber, stretching for thousands of miles, has become a huge source of wealth for the socialist construction of Xinjiang.
    Just as I was talking with the working comrades of the forest farm, I suddenly heard a girl's voice behind me:
    "Hello, Uncle!"
    This greeting made me completely forget in an instant that I was in Shihezi, in the Tianshan Mountains. I thought I had met a relative on the streets of Beijing. However, when I then heard the sound of "Hello, Uncle" and "Uncle, you must be tired from your journey" falling like a downpour, I immediately regained my senses and realized that I was surrounded by dozens of Young Pioneers. Their sudden attack had disarmed my mental preparation, leaving me at a loss for a moment. Everyone was scrambling to shake my hand. The children in the front refused to give way, and the children in the back were scrambling to push forward.
    At that time, I was completely immersed in a sea of ​​enthusiasm. The children were welcoming a stranger so innocently and enthusiastically because this stranger was from the capital of our great motherland, from where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao were located.
    They focused all their enthusiasm on greeting Chairman Mao. Their faces were flushed, their eyes were wide open, and they were greeting Chairman Mao in such a spontaneous and unanimous way. In fact, they were not only concerned about Chairman Mao's health, but they were also concerned about everything about Chairman Mao. They were so eager to know more about Chairman Mao. Listen to their questions: "What does Chairman Mao eat every day?" "Does Chairman Mao take a nap?" "Does Chairman Mao watch movies?" How innocent and sincere they were! When I told them that Chairman Mao was taller and more robust than me, how excitedly they clapped their little hands and laughed! They were too clear about their relationship with Chairman Mao. All the happiness they enjoy today is inseparable from the name of Chairman Mao! But this is not the most important thing. What is really important is that in their lives, they will always follow this great leader, follow the path indicated by the great leader, and contribute all their lives, without reservation, to their great motherland and the great cause of socialist construction!
    The children jumped and asked me to tell stories about Beijing. But where should I start telling stories about Beijing? Fortunately, a girl relieved me. She wanted me to tell her about Beihai. So everyone sat quietly on the hillside, and I told them about Beihai: about the White Pagoda on Qionghua Island, about the Nine-Dragon Wall, about the Five-Dragon Pavilion, and said that there was a "Children's Home" behind the Five-Dragon Pavilion, and that the Young Pioneers of Beijing often went to Beihai on Sundays for team day activities, and some even rowed boats to have fun with the navy. I also said that south of Beihai there is Zhongnanhai, and Zhongnanhai is full of dense forests. At night, when you pass by the Jin'ao and Yu? bridges, which are made of white marble, have five bridge holes, and are like a jade belt spanning between Beihai and Zhongnanhai, and see the distant lights of the embankment reflected in the sea on the south side, it is as beautiful as a mythical realm. It is there that our great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, lives. Chairman Mao has always been concerned about our next generation, instructing you to be healthy, study well, and work well! He hopes that you will study hard, exercise well, and strive to become model standard-bearers for building a socialist society in the future! I asked: "Are you healthy?" "Yes!" "Are you studying well?" "Yes!" "Are you living a good life?" "Yes!" "Who brought you happiness?" "The Communist Party, Chairman Mao!" "Will you be able to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland when you grow up?" "Yes! We certainly will!"
    We asked and answered, sang and echoed, talked and laughed like a pot of water spilled on the ground, and the children were all happy.
    These children were students from the First Children's Primary School in the new city of Shihezi, which I had visited the day before. They were led by several teachers and brought their own rice, vegetables, clothes, and bedding to the forest farm, crossing mountains and ridges to spend their summer camp life here. This place has lush forests on one side and green grassy slopes on the other. How relaxed and happy the children are living here, climbing mountains and telling stories! Children go to the Tianshan Mountains for summer camp! This is simply unimaginable. This is the life of the new China, this is the style of the new China! When I was about to return to Shihezi, the children rushed up again. The wheels of the car moved inch by inch through the sea of ​​people. Everyone was waving their hands, waving their handkerchiefs, waving their red scarves, and everyone was enthusiastically and repeatedly entrusting me to say hello to Chairman Mao when I returned to Beijing.
    We followed the original road down the mountain, and it was almost eight o'clock when we left the mouth of the mountain. At that time, although the west was still glowing with bright red sunset clouds, a thin twilight had already enveloped the earth. The distant wilderness was like a blue ocean, and that boundless ocean and countless red scarves will forever be the immortal wealth of our country.

    天山上的红领巾
    储安平
    当我访问石河子新城的时候，我抽出一天去游了天山。我们一弯接着一弯地徐徐上盘，要翻过达子庙高峰。当车子越上越高的时候，呈现在我们面前的境界也就越开阔浩壮。纵目北望，看到那铺展在我们脚下的、直到解放以后才创造成为祖国的一个杰出的大棉区的玛纳斯河流域大平原，这时已是莽莽苍苍，成为一片烟雾了。我们祖国的大地是无极无终，我们祖国的富藏是无竭无穷。然而那样美好可爱的土地，过去竟然荒芜连年。现在历史改变了，在这片广阔肥沃的大平原上，拖拉机在安静的旷野上开始发着粗犷的声响，泥土在河水的滋润下不断吐出芬芳的气息。粮田和棉田的面积，一年比一年扩大。不要很久的时间，铁路就要在这大地上通过。铁路将像一支输血的针管，当它一扎进了这枯竭多年的土地，就将使这片大地更加跃动起来。
    当我们终于到达达子庙高峰峰顶的时候，另一幅震人心弦的巨大的图景又出现在我的面前。啊，这就是天山！当我在小学里读书的时候，我就听到“天山”；中国有多少人在很小的时候就已经知道中国有一个“天山”啊！而现在，我终于第一次站在它的面前。虽然从达子庙峰顶到对面的山岭，中间依然隔着好几公里的浅谷浅坡，然而那开阔的浅谷不仅没有冲淡对面山岭矗立的深度，而且仿佛格外衬托出它的豪迈浑厚。山上长着满山的云杉，姿色挺秀，色调森严，而在那长满着云杉的山岭后面，是层层雪峰，上接云天。浅谷中随处扎着一些蒙古包，蒙古包远看起来只剩下白白的一点，而这白白的一点又反过来衬托出山林的深大旷静。
    我们越过峰顶，不久就到了林场。天山一般可以分为三个地带。最上一部分称为雪线，中间一部分称为林带。从奇台西迤伊犁，绵延千里，都长着这种绰约多姿、既高又直的云杉。天山的树木，只长山阴，不长山阳；不长山顶，不长山麓，只长山腰。林区最稠密的地方，一平方公里中有1，600多株。这绵延千里的丰富的木材，成为新疆社会主义建设的一个巨大的富源。
    正当我和林场的工作同志谈话时，蓦地听到背后有一个女孩子的声音：
    “伯伯您好！”
    这一句问候使我在一刹那间完全忘了我是在石河子、在天山。我以为我是在北京的街道上遇见了什么亲眷。然而当我接着听到那像倾盆大雨跌落而来的你一句“伯伯您好”、他一句“伯伯您路上辛苦了”的时候，我的神志立刻回复过来，原来我被几十个少先队员包围了起来。他们的骤然的袭击竟然解除了我的思想准备，使我一下子不知所措。他们每个人都争着和我握手，前面的孩子不肯让，后面的孩子又争着挤过来。
    我那时完全浸沉在热情的海洋里。孩子们是那样天真热情地欢迎着一个生客，因为这个生客是从我们伟大祖国的首都来的，是从党中央和毛主席所在地来的。
    他们集中了所有的热情问候毛主席。他们的脸涨得红红的，眼睛睁得大大的，他们是那样自发地而又一致地问候毛主席好。实际上，他们不仅关怀毛主席的健康，他们还关怀着毛主席的一切。他们是多么想更多地知道毛主席一点事情。你听他们问：“毛主席每天吃些什么”？“毛主席睡不睡午觉？”“毛主席看不看电影？”他们是多么天真，又多么真挚，当我告诉他们毛主席的个儿比我还高还魁梧的时候，他们是多么兴奋地鼓着他们的小手掌，嘻嘻哈哈直乐！他们是太清楚他们自己和毛主席的关系了。他们今天所能享受到的一切幸福，都是同毛主席的名字分不开的！然而这还不是最最重要的。真正重要的是：在他们的一生里，他们将永远地跟着这个伟大的领袖走，遵循着伟大领袖所指示的道路，把自己的全部生命，毫无保留地贡献给自己的伟大的祖国和伟大的社会主义建设事业！
    孩子们蹦蹦跳跳，要我讲北京的故事。可是北京的故事究竟该从哪儿讲起呢？幸而一个女孩子给我解了围，她要我讲讲北海。于是大家就安静地在山坡上坐下来，我给他们讲北海：讲琼岛白塔、讲九龙壁、讲五龙亭，说五龙亭后面有一个“少年之家”，说北京的少先队队员经常在星期日去北海过队日，有的还划着小船和海军联欢。我又说北海的南面有个中南海、中南海里长着密密的树林。在夜晚，你从那用汉白玉砌成的、有着五个桥洞的、像一条玉带似的横跨在北海和中南海之间的金鳌玉?桥经过，看到南面那远远的倒在海里的堤岸灯影，美得真像一个神话似的境界一样。就在那儿，住着我们各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席。毛主席从来就关心我们的下一代，嘱咐你们要身体好、学习好，工作好！他希望你们好好学习，好好锻炼身体，将来争取做一个建设社会主义社会的模范旗手！我问：“你们的身体好不好？”“好！”“学习好不好？”“好！”“生活过得好不好？”“好！”“谁给你们带来了幸福？”“共产党、毛主席！”“你们大了能不能参加祖国的社会主义建设？”“能！一定能！”
    我们这样一问一答，一唱一和，说说笑笑，就像一盆水在地面上泼开了似的，孩子们都乐开了。
    这些孩子就是我前一天在石河子新城参观的第一子弟小学的学生。他们是由几个老师率领，自己带了米、菜、衣、被，翻山越岭，到这林场来度夏令营生活的。这地方一面是葱郁的森林，一面是绿油油的草坡，孩子们在这儿爬爬山、讲讲故事，生活得多么轻松愉快！孩子们上天山过夏令营！这简直是不能想像的。这就是新中国的生活，这就是新中国的气派！当我要回石河子的时候，孩子们又涌了上来。车轮在人海中一寸一寸地移动，每个人都在扬着手，扬着手帕，扬着红领巾，每个人都热情地、一再叮咛地托我回北京时问候毛主席好。
    我们循着原路下山，出山口的时候已快八点。那时候，西方虽然还泛着鲜红的晚霞，而薄薄的暮色却已掩近大地。远边的原野就像一个蓝色的海洋，那无边的海洋和无数的红领巾，将永远是我们国家的不朽的财富。
