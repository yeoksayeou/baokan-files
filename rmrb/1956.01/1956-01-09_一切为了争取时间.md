　　Everything for Winning Time
    Cui Chengwu
    The state stipulated that the first phase of the renovation project of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Blooming Mill should be completed in late December 1955, but it was actually completed on November 15th; the state stipulated that two huge modern soaking pits in the first phase of the project should be put into production in January 1956, but they were actually put into production on the afternoon of November 26, 1955.
    In early July 1955, the workers of the steelmaking engineering company, responsible for the civil engineering of the No. 1 Blooming Mill, entered the construction site. Civil engineering was the first round of the builders' battle against time and a crucial round in determining victory. In order to build Anshan Iron and Steel quickly and supply more steel to the whole country, and in order to quickly create construction conditions for brother construction units, the workers proposed that they must complete the task, which was originally planned to take four months, in just over two months.
    Construction began, and every worker was determined to thoroughly fulfill their promises. However, in the first three days, only more than 500 cubic meters of earth were excavated. At this rate, excavation alone would take more than a month!
    All the workers on the construction site were very anxious. Wang Guansen, the foreman leading this project, was restless, sitting and walking around. What to do? After several days of thinking, he finally thought, "Manual excavation is slow, wouldn't it be better to use machinery?..." He ran to the site director, but immediately stopped: "The site is so narrow, and there are probably countless obstacles underground. Is it because of these situations that the engineering department didn't decide to use excavators in the construction organization design?..." He turned back to measure the site. The site was more than 30 meters wide, which could completely accommodate an excavator. He also ran to the Blooming Mill, Water Supply Plant, Gas Plant, and Design Institute to inquire about underground obstacles. Everyone said there were no underground obstacles. The next day, he raised this suggestion at the routine meeting.
    As soon as Wang Guansen finished speaking, someone said that this idea was not realistic because the groundwater level at the site was a little more than minus two meters, but the excavated soil was five meters deep. Another person continued, "Last year, when we were excavating at the raw material workshop, we didn't consider the groundwater situation, and as a result, the excavator got stuck in the mud. Not only did it not speed up the project, but it also delayed the construction period by more than a month!"
    Everyone was silent. Wang Guansen was not willing to give up like this. If he didn't think about it, it would be fine, but once he did, a solution really came to him. He said, "The groundwater doesn't matter, we can dig four eight-meter deep wells at the four corners of the site, let the water seep there, and the problem won't be too big!"
    Everyone agreed that this was a good idea and decided to immediately implement mechanical excavation. This decision brought joy to the people. In the past, three shifts of workers working hard for a day could only excavate one or two hundred cubic meters of soil. This time, an excavator could excavate more than four hundred cubic meters a day. The earthwork project, which was about to be delayed, was completed 24 days ahead of schedule.
    The concrete project started next. This happened to coincide with the rainy season, and it rained heavily and lightly for more than ten days. The workers fought against the rain day and night. The ramming workers and pushing workers continued to work even when their clothes were soaked, only stopping when the rain was so heavy that they couldn't open their eyes.
    The project was progressing, and time was flying. In the blink of an eye, the National Day of 1955 arrived. In order to complete all the civil engineering projects by the end of September, Li Shuqi, a young worker who originally planned to return home to visit his parents whom he had been separated from for three years, decided not to go back during the National Day. Wang Defu, who was in his thirties, got married last year and had a son not long ago. How much he wanted to see this child he had been waiting for for many years! So he bought a train ticket long ago, planning to go home and see him during the National Day. But this time, he returned the ticket.
    On the eve of National Day, all the concrete projects of the first phase of the No. 1 Blooming Mill were completed!
    Then, metal structure workers, electrical installation workers, and mechanical installation workers all entered the construction site. A magnificent scene immediately appeared on the construction site: from high altitude to underground, from east to west, from left to right, everywhere there were crowds of people carrying out assembly line operations.
    Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company arranged a plan for the metal structure installation workers according to the overall progress plan of the construction site. This plan required: The soaking pit installation project should be carried out in three phases, with the first phase lasting nine days, the second phase 13 days, and the third phase three days.
    Wang Lianzhang, the captain of the installation team, calculated on his fingers: A soaking pit has more than 300 parts, and each part must be lifted once, which takes more than an hour. In this way, it would take 45 days to install just one soaking pit. How could it be possible to complete two pits in just 25 days? However, a high sense of responsibility for national construction made him not say the word "difficult" when accepting the task. He said, "Okay, we guarantee completion!"
    Wang Lianzhang didn't sleep well for half the night that day.
    "How to guarantee completion of the task?" This question was always churning in his mind. He also clearly remembered what the secretary of the company's Party committee had told him a few days ago: "...The renovation project of the No. 1 Blooming Mill is very important. The first phase of the renovation project alone, if completed one day earlier, can create 300,000 yuan of wealth for the country; more importantly, if the project cannot be completed on time, Anshan Iron and Steel will not be able to produce more steel to support national construction!..." He also remembered when he was building a large rolling mill in 1952, he was just an ordinary worker. Everyone launched a labor competition as soon as they entered the construction site in order to build the factory as soon as possible. After only a few days of competition, the required steel could not be supplied, and the project was forced to stop. Everyone was very anxious and sent him to find the captain. The captain said, "The steel we use is all imported from abroad. It's a long way, and the freight is delayed. Let's do something else first!" At that time, he thought, "How great it would be if we could use more steel produced by our own country!" Now China has its own large rolling mill that can roll various building steels, but no matter how big the large rolling mill is, if the blooming mill cannot supply it with sufficient steel billets, it cannot roll out more steel! Thinking of this, he was even more determined: "We must let everyone think of ways to guarantee completion!"
    As soon as he went to work the next day, he called the squad leaders, experienced veteran workers, and technicians to hold a "Zhuge Liang meeting".
    At the meeting, technician Li Yishan proposed that the more than 300 parts of a soaking pit do not necessarily have to be lifted one by one and installed on the furnace body one by one. Some parts can be welded in advance and then lifted in as a whole. This method is the "integral installation" that Soviet experts introduced to us in the past!
    Everyone thought this method was very good. After research, the parts that originally needed to be lifted 300 times only needed to be lifted 40 or so times! In this way, the first phase of the project only needed six days, the second phase 11 days, and the third phase two days. The actual implementation result was even more unexpected: the first phase of the project only took five days, and the second and third phases took a total of seven days!
    The workers of the mechanical installation team also overcame the difficulty of not having a power supply and completed the project, which was originally expected to be delayed, ahead of schedule.
    The result of the greatly advanced construction period of each type of work required the furnace building engineering team to catch up as well. Most of the workers in the furnace building engineering team were young people who had just arrived at Anshan Iron and Steel not long ago, and in the first few days, they could not complete the plan. However, from the fourth day onwards, they overfulfilled the plan! It turned out that Hu Zhanrong, the captain of the youth commando team, had not slept well for two whole nights and rationally changed the organization of labor so that those who carried ash and those who laid bricks followed one after another without hindering each other. Before laying each brick, they had to practice (pre-install) it once and changed the method of applying slurry with a large trowel to dipping and squeezing slurry.
    The people who built Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Blooming Mill fought against time like this, sparing no personal sacrifice. Now, they have won, leaving the state-stipulated time indicators far behind!

　　一切为了争取时间
    崔诚五
    国家规定鞍钢第一初轧厂第一期改建工程要在1955年12月下旬完成，实际上11月15日就完成了；国家规定第一期工程中的两台巨大的近代化均热炉要在1956年1月投入生产，实际在1955年11月26日下午就投入生产了。
    1955年7月初，担负第一初轧厂土建工程的炼钢工程公司的工人们进入了工地。土建工程是建设者们同时间战斗的第一回合，也是决定能否得到胜利的重要回合。为了快把鞍钢建设起来，供给全国更多的钢铁，为了给兄弟施工单位迅速创造施工条件，工人们提出一定要在两个多月内完成原计划要四个月才能完成的任务。
    开始动工了，每一个工人都决定彻底实现自己的诺言。可是在最初的三天只挖了五百多立方公尺土方，这样下去，单单挖土就要一个多月！
    全工地的工人都非常着急。领导这项工程的工长王关森，坐也不是，走也不是，怎么办呢？经过几天的琢磨，终于想到：“人工挖土慢，用机械不好吗？……”他连跑带跳地去找工地主任，可是马上又停下了：“场地那样窄小，地下还不知有多少障碍物，工程部门是不是因为这些情况才没有在施工组织设计中决定采用挖土机呢？……”他转回去量一量现场。场地有30多公尺宽，完全放得下挖土机。他又跑到初轧厂、给水厂、燃气厂和设计院去打听地下有没有障碍物。人家都说地下没有障碍物。第二天他就在例会上提出这个建议。
    王关森刚讲完，就有一个人说这个想法不现实，因为工地的地下水是负两公尺多一点，可是挖的土却有五公尺深。又有一个人接着说：“去年我们在原料车间挖土的时候，因为没有考虑地下水情况，结果挖土机陷到泥里，不仅没有加快工程进度，反而使工期拖延了一个多月！”
    大家都沉默了。王关森不甘心就这样罢休。不想便罢，一想，办法可真来了。他说：“地下水没有关系，我们可以在工地四角挖上四个八公尺深的井，让水都渗到那里，问题就不大了！”
    大家一致认为这是个好办法，决定马上实行机械挖土。这个决定给人们带来了喜悦。从前，三班工人拚命干一天只能挖一百几十立方公尺土，这次，一台挖土机一天就能挖四百多立方公尺。眼看就要拖期的土方工程，结果提前24天完成了。
    混凝土工程跟着就开始了。这时恰好赶上雨季，大雨小雨一下就是十几天。工人们日夜跟雨水作斗争。捣固工、推车工衣服淋湿了仍然继续干，只有当雨下得叫人睁不开眼的时候，才停一下。
    工程在进展，时间在飞逝。转眼工夫，1955年国庆节就来到了。工人们为了在9月底完成全部土建工程，本来准备在国庆节回家探望已经离别三年的父母的青年工人李树棋，决心不回去了。30挂零的王德福，去年才结婚，不久前生了一个儿子。他是多么想看看这个盼了多年的孩子呀！所以他老早就买车票，打算国庆节回家看看。可是这次又把车票退掉了。
    国庆节前夕，第一初轧厂第一期工程的混凝土工程全部完成了！
    接着，金属结构工人、电气安装工人和机械安装工人都进入了工地。工地上立刻呈现一个雄伟的场面：从高空到地下，从东到西，从左到右，到处都是在进行流水作业的人群。
    鞍钢建设公司根据工地综合进度计划给金属结构安装工人排了一个计划。这个计划要求：均热炉安装工程要分三期进行，第一期工期九天，第二期13天，第三期三天。
    安装队队长王连璋扳着指头算了算：一座均热炉三百多个部件，每个部件都要吊起一次，要用一个多钟头。这样，光安一座均热炉就要45天。两座只25天工期怎能成呢？但是对国家建设的高度责任感使他在接受任务时没有说“困难”两个字，他说：“好，我们保证完成！”
    王连璋当天夜里半宿没睡好觉。
    “怎样保证完成任务？”这个问题总是在他脑子里翻腾。他还清楚地记得前几天公司党委书记给他讲的话：“……第一初轧厂改建工程十分重要，仅仅目前改建的第一期工程，早完工一天，就可给国家创造30万元的财富；更重要的是，如果工程不能按时完工，就将使鞍钢不能生产更多的钢材支援国家建设！……”他又想起1952年建设大型轧钢厂的时候，他还是个普通工人，大家为了尽快地把工厂建设起来，一进工地就展开了劳动竞赛。竞赛了不几天，需要的钢材供不上，工程被迫停止。大家都很着急，派他去找队长。队长说：“我们用的钢材都是从国外进货，道远，货运脱期，咱们先干点别的吧！”当时他曾想：“什么时候用上本国出的钢材多好啊！”现在中国有自己的轧制各种建筑钢材的大型轧钢厂了，可是大型轧钢厂再大，如果初轧厂不能供应它充足的钢坯，它也轧不出更多的钢材呀！想到这里，他更加下了决心：“一定要让大伙想办法保证完成！”
    第二天一上班，他就把各班班长、有经验的老工人和技术人员们找来开“诸葛亮会”。
    会上，技术员李一山提出，一座均热炉的三百多个部件，不一定一件件往上吊，一件件往炉体上安，有些部件可以预先焊好，然后一块吊进去。这个办法就是苏联专家过去向我们介绍的“整体安装”！
    大家都认为这个办法很好。经过研究，原来需要吊三百次的部件，吊40几次就行了！这样，第一期工程只需六天，第二期11天，第三期二天。实际执行结果更是出人意料：第一期工程只用了五天，第二期和第三期共七天！
    机械安装队的工人们也在克服没有电源的困难中提前完成了原来眼看要拖期的工程。
    各工种工期都大大提前的结果，要求筑炉工程队也要迎头赶上去。筑炉工程队的大部分工人都是刚到鞍钢不久的青年，开头几天，都完不成计划。但是，从第四天起，他们超额完成计划！原来是青年突击队长胡占荣想了整整两夜没睡好觉，合理地改变了劳动组织，使担灰的、砌砖的，一个跟着一个，互不妨碍。每砌一块砖之前，都要演（预安装）一次，并且把用大铲抹浆的办法改成了蘸浆和挤浆。
    建设鞍钢第一初轧厂的人们就是这样不惜牺牲个人的一切同时间搏斗着。现在，他们胜利了，把国家规定的时间指标远远地抛在后面！
