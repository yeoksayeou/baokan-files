    Two Coal Mines in Jiaozuo
    Production Level Exceeds Five-Year Plan Target
    The coal production of Wangfeng and Lifeng mines under the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau of Henan Province last year has exceeded the 1957 output target stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan. Among them, Wangfeng Mine overproduced 90,000 tons of coal compared with the 1957 output target; Lifeng Mine overproduced more than 30,000 tons of coal compared with the 1957 output target.
    In October last year, after the Liu Jiuxue coal mining team of Lifeng Mine proposed to the workers of Henan Province to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, more than 600 teams in the Jiaozuo mining area responded to the proposal.
    Now, the leadership of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau has carefully revised this year's draft plan. According to the revised plan, it is estimated that by the end of April this year, the entire mine can comprehensively overfulfill the main targets stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan for 1957, and it is estimated that the output value in 1956 will exceed the 1957 output value target by more than 13%.

    焦作煤矿两个矿井
    生产水平超过五年计划指标
    河南省焦作矿务局的王封和李封两个矿井去年的产煤数量，已经超过了第一个五年计划中规定的1957年的产量指标。其中王封矿比1957年度产量指标多产煤九万吨；李封矿比1957年度产量指标多产煤三万多吨。
    去年10月，李封矿刘九学采煤队向河南省职工提出提前完成五年计划的倡议以后，焦作矿区有六百多个小组响应了倡议。
    现在，焦作矿务局领导上已经认真修订了今年的计划草案。按照修订后的计划，预计到今年4月底，全矿就可以全面超额地完成第一个五年计划中规定的1957年的各项主要指标，预计1956年的产值将超过1957年产值指标的13％还多。
