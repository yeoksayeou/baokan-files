Land has already been connected into large tracts; however, there remain heartbreaking marks left over from when the land was divided into small pieces.

This is part of the large tract of land at the Sima Collective Farm in Xingyang, Henan. Here are two rows of pear trees. One row is tall and lush, the other is short and thin. The two rows of trees are close together.

The people of Sima Village will tell you the story of these two rows of pear trees as if talking about the ridiculous things they did in their ignorant youth:

Not long ago, there was a boundary line in the middle of these two rows of trees. The land west of the boundary belonged to Hou Yongxin, and the land east of the boundary belonged to his younger brother, Hou Shitou. Yongxin wanted to take advantage, so he planted a row of pear trees right next to the boundary. Shitou quickly planted a row of trees on his own land, secretly applying fertilizer. The trees planted by the younger brother grew faster; the trees planted by the older brother were blocked by the sunlight and deprived of nutrients by the trees planted by the younger brother, and they did not grow for many years.

The older brother was angry, but he had nothing to say. Blood brothers became enemies.

Now, people can't help but say when they walk here: "Look, this is how private land ownership harms people!"

There were many more tragic events caused by private land ownership!

The people of Sima Village all remember that Hou Fuxiang, Hou Luming, and Hou Shuming, three close relatives, fought with iron chains and broadswords over a ridge of land, resulting in bloodshed. At that time, in the village, as soon as brothers divided the family, they would definitely fight over land. At that time, it was impossible to survive without land; some poor farmers suffered so much to get a small piece of land! And how many times more suffering did they endure to keep the small piece of land they had worked so hard to get! Hou Yulan's family pawned their land, and she worked as a cook for others for 40 years before she could redeem the land. …

Could they live a good life with a small piece of land? It was still very difficult! With exploiters weighing down on them, none of the working people could live a carefree day.

In the great storm of land reform, the landless and land-poor peasants breathed a sigh of relief and obtained the land they had longed for for many years, for which they had shed countless blood, sweat, and tears. However, the land, divided into small pieces, could not bring people prosperous days.

A small piece of land cannot be irrigated much by digging a well, and no one is enthusiastic about digging wells. Those who have dug wells can only irrigate two or three mu, even though one well could irrigate 30 mu. Those who do not have wells have no choice but to watch their crops wither and die during droughts and have to go out and "flee famine."

There are 40 mu of low-lying land in the east of the village, which is flooded every rainy season. According to the soil quality, this 40 mu of land could yield at least 10,000 jin of grain a year; however, in reality, it can only yield more than 1,000 jin each year. Originally, it would be good to dig a drainage channel to divert the water. However, because the 40 mu of land is privately owned by many families, this channel cannot be dug. People have no choice but to watch the flood turn this "grain storage" into a large puddle every year.

Who doesn't want to get rid of these sufferings?

Who doesn't want to live a better life?

After the end of the land reform, the farmers of Sima Village continued to advance on the road of mutual aid and cooperation under the guidance of the Communist Party.

In the autumn of 1952, an agricultural production cooperative appeared here.

The land was still the same land. However, the yield increased year by year. In 1952, in the mutual aid team, the average grain yield per mu was 188 jin. In 1953, in the cooperative, it was 296 jin. In 1954, it was 336 jin. In 1955, it was 373 jin—almost double that of 1952.

The income of the cooperative members increased year by year.

The "New Road" Agricultural Production Cooperative in this village earned 0.64 yuan per labor day in 1953; 0.78 yuan per labor day in 1954; and 0.95 yuan per labor day in 1955.

Land remuneration gradually decreased.

The profit distribution ratio between land and labor was 40% for land and 60% for labor in 1953. In 1954, it was 30% for land and 70% for labor (part of the technical crops exceeding the general yield was distributed to labor). In 1955, it was still 30% for land and 70% for labor (all crops exceeding the general yield were distributed to labor).

There were disputes every year when the distribution ratio was changed. The result of each dispute made people more aware that the most valuable thing is labor, not land.

The Party branch conducted education on the value of labor creation to the cooperative members at the time of each profit distribution. Although the distribution ratio of land was reduced each time, the cooperative members with more land still increased their income. After two profit distributions, people saw that their income was increasing every year, so they were convinced and agreed to reduce land remuneration.

The cooperative members all admitted: "In the past few years, the land has been cultivated much better than in the past!"

"Land is dead, labor is alive; adding more labor can increase the yield of crops; doing more labor days can distribute more profits." This concept has gradually taken root deeply in people's hearts.

When the cooperative members divided their families, no one wanted land anymore. They said that it was more troublesome to work on the land than to work two more days!

In the summer of 1954, after the "New Road" Agricultural Production Cooperative changed the profit distribution ratio between land and labor from 40% for land and 60% for labor to 30% for land and 70% for labor, among the 50 cooperative member households, there were 28 people (17 women and 11 men) who rarely participated in field labor in the past, now often participated in field labor. The number of labor days done gradually became the center of the cooperative members' consideration of life issues.

In the spring of 1955, an agricultural machinery station was established in Sima Village.

When machines arrived in the fields, it became even more obvious how stupid it was for the private ownership system to divide the land into many small pieces. At that time, in order to facilitate mechanized farming, the cooperative members were already willing to move the boundary stones in the fields. However, the cooperative was not large enough, and there were still many scattered plots. The land of those who had not yet joined the cooperative was even more of a hindrance to tractors. The land remaining after mechanized farming that was inconvenient for mechanized farming was plowed for another 3 days with 8 livestock, and the cooperative members felt awkward whenever they thought of this. Also, combine harvesters had already been transported to Xingyang Station. However, the road was too narrow to drive through, and even if they could drive through, how could the large machine that could harvest more than 1,000 mu of wheat a day be deployed on such land?

The autumn harvest came. The corn planted in the mechanized farming land yielded more than 70 jin per mu than the corn planted on non-mechanized farming land, and the tobacco planted in the mechanized farming land yielded more than 50 jin more tobacco leaves per mu than the non-mechanized farming land (according to the dried leaves that had been cured).

Machines further excavated people's private ownership concept of land, exposing it to the sun and melting it like ice.

The instructions of the Party and the government on production planning are even more inspiring: to eliminate general floods and droughts within a few years, eliminate major insect pests, eliminate rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, and flies... and to increase yields several times over. When people were making production plans for their village, they discovered that the private land ownership system still restricted many kinds of agricultural infrastructure construction (although the land had been unified for use by the cooperative, some people were still unwilling to allow the cooperative to dig soil in their land), and the private land ownership system also restricted the further development of labor enthusiasm (some cooperative members with more land still felt that it didn't matter if they did less labor, because people with more land could still get a larger share according to the 30% for land and 70% for labor profit distribution). After the village formulated the production plan, people said: it was like they were about to touch socialism, but there were still stumbling blocks on the road to touch it.

They were determined to abolish land remuneration; they were determined to change the system of private land ownership; they were determined to further unite and establish collective farms.

Of course, "ten fingers are not all the same length," and a few people initially had some concerns.

Widowed and childless old women were afraid that they would not be able to work and would starve, and that if they lost their land, no one would adopt a son to support them in their old age and bury them. They soon learned that: collective farms were larger in scale than cooperatives, with more detailed division of labor, and there would be more light work to do in the future; collective farms had more public welfare funds to take care of them. They were happy and said: this is better than having an adopted child!

People with more land were still somewhat nostalgic for private land ownership. After making production plans and calculating the increased production, they also understood that: abolishing land remuneration, improving the labor enthusiasm of all cooperative members, and making the land more convenient for unified use could increase production more quickly; distributing profits based solely on labor would also increase their income compared to the past.

Some people were afraid of being labeled with the "crime" of "unfilial piety," saying: "The property that our ancestors worked hard to acquire for generations, wouldn't it be kicked away by me all at once?" People with this kind of thinking quickly understood that: joining a collective farm was not abandoning the land, but using the collective power to protect the land more firmly, so that it would never fall into the hands of exploiters again. Many good things that our ancestors could not accomplish can be accomplished in our generation with collective power. What we are doing now is worthy of our ancestors and even more worthy of our descendants for generations to come.

"We all rely on labor days to eat!" "We have no objection to abolishing land shares, but we are afraid of not having enough work to do!" The farmers of Sima Village said these words solemnly and happily, taking pride in it.

The comrades of the work team initially underestimated the level of awareness of the masses, and wrote in the draft charter they helped them draft: "The farmland of the farm members shall be used by the collective farm permanently without compensation." The issue of land ownership was not mentioned. When discussing how to regulate the land, the farm members said that this regulation was unclear and demanded to change it to "The farmland originally owned by the farm members shall be collectively owned by all farm members." They enthusiastically expressed their determination to bid farewell to the painful private ownership of the means of production.

People who had once fought and bled over a ridge of land now met with smiles and laughter.

The farm members now have only one thought: to use the collective power to grow more things on the land! Some people who used to be lazy and unmotivated are now participating in the cooperative's production labor with renewed vigor. The water diversion channel that needed to be dug to save the 40 mu of "grain storage," which the old men had longed for for decades but had not been able to dig, was now dug in a dozen hours (a total of more than 60,000 cubic feet of earth was dug).

Private ownership turned brothers into enemies; collective ownership turned enemies into brothers.

Private ownership restricted productive forces in a narrow cage; collective ownership completely liberated productive forces.

    抛弃了土地私有制度
    燕凌
    土地，已经连成大片了；可是，还残留着土地被一小块一小块分割着的时候造成的使人痛心的标记。
    这是河南荥阳司马集体农庄的大片土地的一部分。这里有两行梨树。一行高大茂盛，另一行又矮又瘦。两行树紧紧靠在一起。
    司马村的人都会像谈起自己年幼无知的时代做过的可笑的事情那样向你叙述这两行梨树的故事：
    不久以前，这两行树的中间有一道地界。地界西边的地是侯永新的，地界东边的地是他的弟弟侯石头的。永新想占便宜，紧靠着地边栽了一行梨树。石头赶忙在自己的地边也栽上了一行树，暗地加工施肥。弟弟栽的树比较快地长大了；哥哥栽的树被弟弟栽的树遮住了阳光，夺去了养分，好多年了也没长大。
    哥哥心里生气，也没话可说。亲兄弟成了冤家对头。
    现在，人们走到这里就不由得说：“看，土地私有就是这样害人！”
    土地私有造成的更悲惨的事件还多呢！
    司马村的人们都记得，侯福祥、侯鲁明、侯书明亲叔伯爷儿3个人，为了争一垅地，拿着铁索、大刀打架，打得头破血流。那时候，村里的人，只要弟兄一分家，就一定要为争地产打架。那时候，没有地就没法过；有些贫苦的农民，为了得到一小片土地，受了多大的辛苦！为了保持自己千辛万苦得到的一小片土地，又受了多少倍的辛苦！侯玉兰家把地当了出去，她出去给人家做了40年饭，才把地赎了回来。……
    得到了一小片地，日子就能过吗？还是很难！有剥削者压在头上，劳动人民谁也不能松松快快过一天。
    在土地改革的大风暴里，没地缺地的农民出了一口气，得到了自己想望多年、曾经为它流了无数血汗眼泪的土地。可是，分割得一小片一小片的土地，并不能带给人们富裕日子。
    一小片地，挖个井浇不了多少，谁也不热心挖井。挖了井的，本来一个井能浇30亩地，也只能浇两三亩。没有井的，天旱了，只好眼看着庄稼枯死，只好出去“逃荒”。
    村东边有40亩洼地，年年雨季被淹。按土质说，这40亩地一年至少能收1万多斤粮食；可是，实际上每年只能收1，000多斤。本来，挖一道排水渠道把水引出去就好了。可是，因为40亩地是归许多家私有的，这渠道就挖不成。人们只好眼看着洪水每年把这个“粮食囤”变成大水坑。
    谁不愿意摆脱这些苦难呢？
    谁不愿意把日子过得更好呢？
    司马村的农民，在土地改革结束以后，就在共产党指引的互助合作的道路上继续前进了。
    1952年秋天，这里出现了一个农业生产合作社。
    土地，还是那些土地。产量，却一年年地增长。1952年，在互助组里，粮食每亩平均产量是188斤。1953年，在合作社里，是296斤。1954年，是336斤。1955年，是373斤——比1952年几乎增加了一倍。
    社员们的收入年年增加。
    这个村的“新路”农业生产合作社，1953年每个劳动日合0.64元；1954年每个劳动日合0.78元，1955年每个劳动日合0.95元。
    土地报酬渐渐地降低了。
    土地和劳力的分红比例，1953年是地四劳六，1954年是地三劳七（一部分技术作物超过一般产量的部分归劳力分配），1955年仍是地三劳七（所有作物超过一般产量的部分都归劳力分配）。
    每年改变分配比例，都要发生争论。每次争论的结果都使人们更加认清了最贵重的是劳动而不是土地。
    党支部在每次分红的时候都向社员进行了劳动创造价值的教育。每次分红的结果，虽然降低了土地分红比例，地多的社员也还是增加了收入。经过两次分红，人们看到自己的收入每年在增加，也就心服口服，同意降低土地报酬了。
    社员们谁也承认：“这几年，地种得真比过去强！”
    “地是死的，劳动力是活的；多加了劳动，地里就能多收庄稼；多做劳动日，就能多分红。这个观念，在人们心里渐渐地深深地扎了根。
    在社员分家的时候，谁也不愿意再要土地了。他们说，在土地上打搅，多找麻烦，还不如多劳动两天！
    1954年夏天，当“新路”农业生产合作社把土地、劳力的分红比例由地四劳六改成地三劳七以后，在50户社员里边，就有28个过去很少参加田间劳动的人（女17，男11）经常参加了田间劳动。做劳动日多少，渐渐地成了社员考虑生活问题的中心。
    1955年春天，农业机器站在司马村建立起来了。
    机器开到了地里，就更显出来私有制把土地分割成许多小块是多么蠢。那时候，为了便于机耕，社员们已经乐意搬掉地里的界石了。可是，合作社还不够大，插花地还很多。还没有入社的人的地，对于拖拉机来说更嫌碍事。机耕以后剩下的不便机耕的地横头，又用8个牲口犁了3天，社员们对于这件事，一想起来就觉得别扭。还有，联合收割机已经运到了荥阳车站。可是，路太窄，开不过来，就是开来了，那个一天能收割一千多亩麦子的大机器，在这样的土地上又怎能施展得开呢？
    收秋了。机耕地里种的玉米，比不是机耕的地上种的，每亩多打了70来斤，机耕地里种的烟，比不是机耕的每亩多收了50来斤烟叶（按炕好的干叶子说）。
    机器把人们对于土地的私有观念，更深一层地挖掘了出来，使它晒在太阳下面，像冰块一样融化了。
    党和政府关于生产规划的指示更加振奋人心：要在几年内消灭一般的水灾旱灾，消灭主要的虫害，消灭鼠雀蚊蝇，……要把产量再成几倍地提高。人们在做本村的生产规划的时候发现：土地的私有制度仍然限制许多种农业基本建设的进行（虽然土地已经归合作社统一使用了，可是有些人总还不愿意合作社在他的地里挖土），土地私有制度也还限制劳动积极性的进一步发挥（有些土地比较多一些的社员仍然觉得少劳动一些也不要紧，按地三劳七分红，土地多的人还是能多分一些）。村里制定了生产规划以后，人们说：这就像快要摸着了社会主义一样，可是，要走过去摸着它，路上还有绊脚索。
    他们决心取消土地报酬；他们决心改变土地私有制度；他们决心进一步联合起来，建立集体农庄。
    当然，“十个指头不一般齐”，少数人最初还有一些顾虑。
    孤寡老婆怕自己不能劳动要挨饿受罪，怕没有了土地再没有人给自己做过继儿养老送终。她们很快就知道了：农庄比合作社规模更大了，分工更细了，以后有更多的轻活可以做；集体农庄有更多的公益金可以照顾她们。她们乐了，说：这行，比要个过继孩儿还好！
    地比较多一些的人，对土地私有还有些留恋。做了生产规划，算了增产账以后，他们也就明白了：取消土地报酬，全体社员的劳动积极性提高了，土地也更便于统一使用了，生产就能更快地提高；光按劳动分红，他们的收入也会比过去增加。
    有的人怕落个“不孝”的“罪名”，说：“老祖宗几辈子艰难困苦置下的产业，这一下岂不是经我手一下子踢腾了？”有这种想法的人，很快也就弄明白了：加入集体农庄并不是把地丢了，而是用集体的力量更牢靠地保住了土地，使它永远不会再落到剥削者的手里。老祖宗没有能够办到的许多好事，在我们这一代都可以用集体的力量办成。我们现在要做的事，既对得起祖先，更对得起子孙万代。
    “我们全指望劳动日吃饭哩！”“ 取消地股没意见，怕的只是缺活干！”司马村的农民庄严而又高兴地说这样的话，以此自豪。
    工作组的同志们最初过低地估计了群众的觉悟程度，在帮助他们拟定的章程草案上写着：庄员的耕地由集体农庄无代价地永久使用。”没有提到土地的所有权问题。在讨论对土地究竟怎样规定的时候，庄员都说这样规定不明不白，要求改成“庄员原有的耕地归全体庄员集体所有”。他们热烈地表示出来了同使人痛苦的生产资料私有制告别的决心。
    曾经为了争一垅地打得头破血出的人们，现在见了面有说有笑了。
    庄员们现在只有一个心思：用集体的力量使土地上生长出来更多的东西！一些过去懒懒散散的人，现在精神焕发地参加社里的生产劳动了。为了救出40亩的“粮食囤”需要挖的引水渠道，老头们想望了几十年也没挖成，现在，十几个钟头就挖成了（总共挖土6万多立方尺）。
    私人所有制把兄弟变成了仇人；集体所有制把仇人变成了兄弟。
    私人所有制把生产力限制在狭小的笼子里；集体所有制使生产力完全得到解放。
