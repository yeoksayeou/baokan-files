    Where Can Dulles Escape To?
    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles issued a statement at a press conference on January 17 regarding his bellicose remarks in "Life" magazine, attempting to parry the severe criticism and condemnation of world public opinion towards the remarks. However, neither this statement nor the press conference could allow this advocate of the "brink of war" policy to escape the predicament of being like "a rat crossing the street, everyone shouts to beat it," nor could it conceal Dulles's crime of clamoring for war.
    According to Western journalists, Dulles was "unusually nervous" at this "intense" press conference. This is entirely understandable. He originally attempted to use war intimidation to terrify the Chinese people and drag the American people and America's allies to the brink of war. However, contrary to his expectations, he found that the American people opposed him; a section of the American ruling group worried that he would cause trouble; America's allies were greatly dissatisfied with him; and sober public opinion around the world expressed shock and anger. He did not intimidate the Chinese people at all, but only completely isolated himself. The attacks and questions Dulles suffered at the "intense" press conference on the 17th were a ruthless reflection of this situation. It can be seen that war-mongers are turning themselves into dregs in world politics, and that the people's determination to consolidate peace is the real driving force behind the transformation of international life today.
    But Dulles did not learn any lessons from his unexpected discovery. At the press conference on the 17th, although he tried to evade responsibility for the remarks he made in "Life" magazine, he actually clung to his intimidation policy. He still wanted to use the clamor of "we will fight" to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating their own territory. He also described the U.S. use of force to forcibly occupy our territory of Taiwan and Penghu as "defending" America's "basic moral values and vital interests."
    According to Dulles, only by allowing the United States to invade Taiwan, infringe upon China's sovereignty, and interfere in China's internal affairs can America's "basic moral values and vital interests" be maintained, and can there be so-called "just and lasting peace." It is quite obvious: this is the "morality" and "interests" of aggressors and colonialists, this is a robber-style "peace." The entire civilized humanity will not tolerate such absurd "basic moral values" and "peace."
    Dulles's words are actually an attempt to continue to threaten the Chinese people with war and obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. This proves that although the U.S. "policy of strength" has completely gone bankrupt, and although his war clamors have aroused widespread anger in world public opinion, he still wants to adhere to the "policy of strength" and still does not want to change his plans to clamor for war. No matter how Dulles denies his connection with the article in "Life" magazine, this war-monger has nowhere to escape under the bright eyes of peace-loving people around the world.
    Of course, Dulles's war intimidation against the Chinese people absolutely cannot stop the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan. No matter how Dulles clamors, Taiwan must be liberated. If Dulles actually drags this world to the brink of war, then he must prepare for a world that does not want war to push him off the cliff first.

### 杜勒斯逃到哪里去

    杜勒斯逃到哪里去
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在1月17日记者招待会上就他对“生活”杂志的好战谈话发表了一个声明，企图招架世界舆论对这个谈话的严厉抨击和责难。但是，这个声明以及这次记者招待会都没有能够使这个“战争边缘”政策的鼓吹者逃脱“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的处境，也不能掩饰杜勒斯叫嚣战争的罪恶。
    据西方记者说，杜勒斯在这个“激烈的”记者招待会上“态度异乎寻常的紧张”。这是完全可以理解的。他本来企图用战争恫吓来骇倒中国人民，并且把美国人民和美国的盟国拖到战争边缘上去。但是，出乎他的意料之外，他发现美国人民反对他；美国统治集团中一部分人担心他闯祸；美国的盟国对他大为不满；全世界清醒的舆论表示震惊和愤怒。他一点也没有把中国人民吓倒，而只是使他自己完全孤立。杜勒斯在17日“激烈的”记者招待会上遭受的抨击和质问是这种情势的无情的反映。可见战争叫嚣者正在把他自己变成世界政治中的渣滓，可见人民巩固和平的决心才是今天转移国际生活的真正动力。
    但是杜勒斯却并没有从他的意外发现中得到什么教训。在17日的记者招待会上，他虽然一面企图逃避他对“生活”杂志上所发表的谈话的责任，实际上他还是抓住他的恫吓政策。他仍然想用“我们将进行战斗”的叫嚣来阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土。他又把美国行使武力强占我国领土台湾、澎湖，说成是“保卫”美国的什么“基本的道义价值和切身利益”。
    照杜勒斯的说法，只有让美国侵占台湾，侵犯中国的主权，干涉中国的内政，才能保持美国的“基本的道义价值和切身利益”，才能有所谓“公正和持久的和平”。十分明显：这是侵略者和殖民主义者的“道义”和“利益”，这是强盗式的“和平”。全体文明人类都不会容许有这种荒谬的“基本的道义价值”和“和平”。
    杜勒斯的这些话实际上是企图继续对中国人民进行战争威胁，阻挠中国人民解放台湾。这就证明，虽然美国的“实力政策”已经彻底破产，虽然他的战争叫嚣已经引起世界舆论广泛的愤怒，他仍然要坚持“实力政策”，仍然不想改变自己的叫嚣战争的打算。无论杜勒斯怎样抵赖他和“生活”杂志上的文章的干系，在全世界爱好和平的人民的雪亮的眼睛下面，这个战争的叫嚣者是无所逃遁的。
    当然，杜勒斯对中国人民的这种战争恫吓，绝对阻挠不了中国人民解放台湾的决心。无论杜勒斯怎样叫嚣，台湾一定要解放。如果杜勒斯竟然把这个世界拖到战争的边缘，那么他就要准备一个不要战争的世界先把他推下悬崖。
