The Sanlian Township in Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, is a mountainous area where crops have historically suffered severely from damage caused by wild animals. Last autumn, a youth hunting team of 125 people was established here. They formulated a wild animal protection agreement and an incentive system, and set up thatched sheds on the mountains, taking turns to keep watch at night. Regardless of snow or rain, they would organize forces to pursue and hunt down any traces of wild animals they discovered. Thanks to the efforts of the youth hunting team, the number of wild animals in the township has greatly decreased, food production has increased, and the masses can now attend meetings in the evening with peace of mind.

According to statistics, in the four months of 1955, they killed 869 wild animals, including wild boars and porcupines, protecting crops. The hunted wild animals were also sold for more than 4,700 yuan, increasing everyone's income.

Organizing young people to participate in hunting has the above-mentioned benefits and can also cultivate the qualities of courage and resourcefulness in young people. Currently, 47 young people in this hunting team have become skilled hunters.

    青年打猎队
    浙江桐庐县三联乡是个山区，过去农作物受到兽害十分严重。去年秋天，这里建立了125人的青年打猎队。他们订出防兽公约和奖励制度，并在山上设置茅铺，轮流守夜，不管雪天雨夜，发现兽迹就组织力量，追击、搜捕。经过青年打猎队的努力，现在这个乡的野兽大大减少了，食粮增产了，群众晚间开会也安心了。
    据统计，1955年4个月当中，就打到野猪、豪猪等各种野兽869只，保护了农作物，猎获的野兽还卖得了4，700多元，增加了大家的收入。
    组织青年参加打猎，除了有以上的好处外，还能够培养青年的勇敢机智的品质。现在，这个打猎队里已经有47名青年成为熟练的打猎手。
