Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 16th. According to sources here, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu stated at a press conference in Rangoon on January 10th that if the Communist Party gives up its armed struggle against the government, the Burmese government is prepared to legalize the organization of the Burmese Communist Party. U Nu said that there was no reason why the Communist Party should not exist in Burma; he also said: We do not oppose communist ideology itself, but we oppose their armed struggle.

Another report from the Rangoon English-language "Nation" on December 1, 1955, stated that the Burmese Communist Party had submitted a statement to the government requesting face-to-face negotiations to end the civil war. The statement included demands for the government to implement an independent foreign policy, release political prisoners, and grant the people full democratic rights and the legitimate rights of all parties.

Based on the above news, it appears that both the Burmese government and the Burmese Communist Party have expressed their willingness to quickly seek domestic peace, which is what the broad masses of the Burmese people hope for. However, a report from Washington on the 10th by International News Service reporter Gordon indicates that the US ruling clique is unwilling to see the Burmese government legalize the Burmese Communist Party, and is attempting to obstruct the Burmese people from achieving domestic peace. At a time when the Burmese people and the Asian people are expecting Burma to restore domestic peace in order to better safeguard Burma's independence, democracy, and prosperity, people must be vigilant against the imperialists' conspiracies to undermine internal relations and obstruct the restoration of domestic peace.

    吴努表示缅政府准备让缅共合法化
    新华社香港16日电　据此间收到消息，缅甸总理吴努1月10日在仰光记者招待会上说，如果共产党放弃反对政府的武装斗争，缅甸政府准备让缅甸共产党的组织合法化。吴努说，没有理由说明为什么共产党不应当在缅甸存在；又说：我们并不反对共产主义思想本身，但是我们反对他们的武装斗争。
    另据仰光英文“民族报”1955年12月1日消息说，缅甸共产党已向政府提出举行面对面的谈判以结束内战的和谈声明，声明包括要求政府执行独立的外交政策和释放政治犯，给人民以充分民主权利和各党派合法权利等。
    根据上述消息看来，缅甸政府和缅甸共产党双方均表示愿意迅速谋取符合于缅甸广大人民所盼望的国内和平。但是，国际新闻社记者戈登10日自华盛顿发出的报道表明，美国统治集团不愿意看见缅甸政府让缅甸共产党合法化，企图阻碍缅甸人民实现国内和平。当缅甸人民和亚洲人民正在期待缅甸恢复国内和平，以求更好地维护缅甸的独立、民主与繁荣的时候，人们必须警惕帝国主义者破坏内部关系、阻碍恢复国内和平的阴谋。
