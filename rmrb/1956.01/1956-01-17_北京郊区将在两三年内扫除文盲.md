    Illiteracy to be Eliminated in Beijing Suburbs Within Two to Three Years
    Within two to three years, illiteracy among approximately 200,000 young and middle-aged farmers in the suburbs of Beijing will be eradicated. This was the literacy plan proposed at a joint meeting of cultural and educational section chiefs of Beijing suburban districts and propaganda ministers of the Youth League district committees held on the 12th and 13th.
    The plan requires the elimination of illiteracy among rural cadres and youth by 1957; and the elimination of illiteracy among all farmers in the suburbs before the spring of 1959. This spring, all eligible young and middle-aged illiterate farmers should be mobilized to enroll in school. Literacy associations at the municipal, district, and township levels will also be established. In the future, each district in the suburbs of Beijing will hold two examinations each year, and those who pass the examination will be issued literacy certificates.

    北京郊区将在两三年内扫除文盲
    两、三年以内，北京市郊区约20万青壮年农民中的文盲都要成为识字的人。这是12、13两日举行的北京市郊区文教科长和青年团区委会宣传部长联席会议上提出的扫盲规划。
    这个规划要求在1957年内扫除农村干部和青年中的文盲；到1959年春季以前，全郊区农民中的文盲都要被扫除。今年春季，要动员一切可能入学的青壮年农民文盲入学。市、区、乡三级扫盲协会也将要成立。今后北京市郊各区每年要举行两次考试，考试成绩及格的发给扫盲证书。
