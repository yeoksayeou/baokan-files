    On the Banks of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers
    By Our Correspondent Fu Dong
    It was completely dark when I arrived in Wuchang. I wanted to cross the river to Hankou on the opposite bank immediately. But I waited and waited at the wharf, and several tens of minutes passed without seeing the ferry. The wind was strong, blowing the boats moored at the shore up and down like seesaws. A comrade from Wuhan City pointed to the turbulent Yangtze River in front of us and said: "There is an ancient poem that describes this rushing Yangtze River: 'White waves like mountains, how can one cross, a fierce wind worries the helmsman!' It is absolutely true that these rolling river waters have separated Wuhan City for thousands of years. All passengers and goods have to be delayed here for a while."
    The comrade who was introducing me immediately changed his tone and pointed to the sparkling lights on the river in the distance, saying: "There, between Snake Hill and Tortoise Hill, we will soon build a steel bridge. This bridge will be more than a kilometer long, and the piers alone will be more than a dozen stories high. The bridge will have two layers, the lower layer can accommodate two trains running in opposite directions, and the upper layer can accommodate six cars side by side. Large ships can pass under the bridge."
    I was eager to go to the construction site of the Wuhan Bridge to see it. The next day after arriving in Wuhan, I got the opportunity to visit. When I got to the shore, I was immediately attracted by the busy scene at the construction site. Iron barges constantly sailed on the vast river, full of construction materials and machinery. Here, one could also see the long steel arms of the cranes waving in the air. The rumbling of motors could be heard everywhere.
    On the No. 5 pier in the center of the river, welders were concentrating on welding with their welding torches, and sparks of blue and green flew everywhere. A young engineer introduced that workers are now using the world's newest construction method—the pipe column drilling method—to replace the old pneumatic caisson method, so workers don't have to go into the water to build the bridge.
    I stood on the banks of the Yangtze River for a long, long time. Although I did not see the magnificent scene of workers lifting, reinforcing, and sinking four-story-high, one or two-hundred-ton steel cofferdams into the Yangtze River, which was thirty or forty meters deep. But I could imagine that great momentum.
    This bridge was not measured for the first time. It was measured as early as 1913 during the period of the Northern Warlords, and then the Kuomintang clamored about it three times, but decades passed, and the bridge remained a bridge on paper. And now, we only need two years and four months to build the bridge, and we are using our own manufactured steel.
    Two years later, people here will not only be able to recite the poem: "Distant sails fade into the green mountains, only the Yangtze River flows to the horizon!" But also write new poems to praise this "beautiful rainbow" that newly appears in the sky above the Yangtze River! Praise this "people's bridge" and "socialist bridge!"

    The train left Zhengzhou Station and traveled north for several tens of minutes, and then a long bridge came into view. This is the famous Yellow River Bridge. People on the train pointed to the large and small canals in the distance and said, "That is the Yellow River irrigation area." I got off the train at the old Tian'an Station next to this canal and switched to a car. The car drove along the banks of the canal, which were planted with willow trees, for a short time before stopping. I found that a new building nearby had five large red characters written on it: "People's Victory Canal."
    The Yellow River, the wide, turbid yellow water, flowed slowly not far away.
    At the sight of the Yellow River, people can easily recall the lines from the Yellow River Cantata: "The water of the Yellow River comes from the sky, surging and roaring, making people's livers and gallbladders burst."
    But now, Comrade Ma Chengqian of the Yellow River Irrigation and Drainage Management Bureau introduced the Yellow River with a completely different mood. He said: "The Yellow River is a harmful water, but now we are making it serve the people." He pointed to the full map of the Yellow River Irrigation and Drainage Project and said: "We have opened a canal here to draw the water of the Yellow River to irrigate the fields. In the dry season of the Wei River, we can also send some water over to allow navigation." He said that the main canal is 52.5 kilometers long. Construction began in 1952. In the year of construction, 280,000 mu of land were irrigated, which increased to 440,000 mu in 1953, 550,000 mu in 1954, 650,000 mu in 1955, and it is estimated that it will increase to 700,000 mu in 1956.
    To illustrate the problem, he cited several figures: For land that has been irrigated, compared to land that has not been irrigated, cotton yields 101 jin (seed cotton) more per mu, corn yields 150 jin more per mu, and general wheat yields more than 20 jin, with the highest yielding up to 62 jin.
    An older comrade with a mustache took me to visit the gate. This comrade operated the gate and said with a heavy Shanxi accent: "That year, Chairman Mao came here and personally operated this gate!" Because of the narration of that meaningful and pleasant past event, his simple face lit up. He continued: "Chairman Mao personally said to us: This gate is very important and must be properly taken care of."
    Others introduced that the old comrade who spoke was Comrade Qiao Dengyun, the head of the canal head section of the Yellow River Irrigation and Drainage Management Bureau.
    After visiting the gate, we took a walk in the fields. Comrade Qiao Dengyun said: "I was very confused earlier. When the leaders transferred me here in May 1952, my thoughts were not clear. I told people, 'This place is a riverbed when you look down, and a barren mountain when you look up.' What did you transfer me here to do?"
    "But now look, we have not only opened a canal, but also turned the wasteland here into fertile land!" Looking in the direction that Comrade Qiao Dengyun pointed, I saw large mounds of fields not far away, and a large forest of small trees a little further away. Qiao Dengyun continued: "In addition to planting 125 mu of crops, we also planted 227 mu of fruit trees, including apples, pears, grapes..."
    "The benefits that water has brought to the farmers are indescribable!" He said with a smile that he often goes to the nearby villages. The people in the village are very enthusiastic when they see him! Just like seeing their own brothers. They say, if it weren't for opening the canal, how could we harvest so much grain!
    Comrade Qiao Dengyun continued: "We are now making plans to irrigate another 650,000 mu of land in the first half of 1957. We also plan to build a small power station here recently to create a diversion baffle to sediment."
    Looking at the new reclaimed land that stretches endlessly in front of me, I thought of a song sung by the people of northern Shaanxi about the Yellow River's long-term prospects:
    Distant mountains, high mountains, forest mountains, nearby mountains, low mountains, flower and fruit mountains;
    River plains are built into rice and grain plains, and dams are built in dry gullies to gather water;
    Pasture is planted in sloping depressions, and gentle slopes become terraced fields.
    At that time:
    Cattle and sheep in groups, green shade fills the mountains, life is even more fulfilling.
    Isn't the current scene exactly like this?
    In a few years, when the 46 sluices on the Yellow River are completed, not only will every household along the river have water in their fields, but every household will also be able to light electric lights. At that time, people can take a 500-ton tugboat from Lanzhou and go straight down the river to the estuary!

    在长江和黄河的岸边
    本报记者　傅冬
    到武昌的时候，天已经完全黑了。我想马上渡到河对岸的汉口去。可是在码头上等了又等，几十分钟过去了，还不见轮渡的影子。风很大，吹得停留在岸边的船只一上一下就像个跷跷板似的。武汉市的同志指着面前汹涌的长江说：“有句古诗形容这奔腾的长江说：‘白浪如山那可渡，狂风愁煞峭帆人！’一点也不错，这滚滚的江水几千年来就这样把武汉市分隔开来。所有的旅客和货物到这里都得耽搁一个时候。”
    介绍的同志说到这里马上换了另一种腔调，指着远处江面上闪耀着的灯火说：“在那里，在蛇山和龟山的中间，我们不久就要修起一座钢铁的桥。这桥有一公里多长，光桥墩就有十几层楼高。桥分两层，下面一层可对开两列火车，上面一层可并行六辆汽车。桥底下可走大轮船。”
    我迫切地想到武汉大桥的工地上去看看。到武汉的第二天，得到机会去访问。到岸边，我就被工地上繁忙的景象吸引住了。在浩瀚的江面上不时地有铁驳船驶过，船上放满了施工用的材料和机件，在这儿人们还可以看见长长的在半空中挥舞着的吊船的钢臂。随处都可以听到隆隆的马达声。
    在江中心的五号桥墩上，电焊工正聚精会神地拿着焊嘴焊接，半蓝半绿的电焊火花四处飞溅着。一个年轻的工程师介绍说，现在工人用世界上最新的施工方法——管柱钻孔法代替过去的压气沉箱法，这样工人不用下到水里就把桥造成了。
    我在长江岸边站了很久很久。我虽然没有在这里看见工人把四层楼那样高一、二百吨重的钢围囹吊起、加固、下沉到三、四十公尺深的长江里的雄伟场面。但是能够想像出那伟大的气魄。
    这一座桥不是头一次测量，1913年北洋军阀时就曾测量过，以后国民党时又嚷嚷过三次，可是几十年过去了，桥，仍是一座纸上的桥。而现在，我们只要用两年零四个月的功夫，就可以把桥造起来了，而且用的是我们自己制造的钢材。
    两年以后，人们在这里不但可以吟那首：“江帆远影碧山尽，唯见长江天际流”的诗！而且还可以写新的诗篇歌颂这长江上空新出现的“一条美丽的虹！”歌颂这“人民的桥”“社会主义的桥！”

    火车离开郑州车站往北走了几十分钟，就看见了一座长长的桥。这就是有名的黄河大桥。同车的人指着远处大大小小的渠道说：“那就是引黄灌溉区”。我就在这渠道旁的老田庵车站下车改换汽车。汽车在这栽满柳树的渠道岸上走了没多久就停下了。我发现在附近不远的一所新建筑物上写着五个红色的大字“人民胜利渠”。
    黄河，那宽阔的浑浊的黄水在不远的地方缓缓地流着。
    一看见黄河，人们很容易就想起黄河大合唱中的：“黄河之水天上来，排山倒海汹涌澎湃奔腾叫嚣使人肝胆破裂”的词句。
    可是现在引黄灌溉济卫管理局的马诚谦同志以一种完全不同的心情介绍黄河。他说：“黄河是一条害人的水，可是现在我们让它为人民服务。”他指着引黄济卫工程的全图说：“我们在这里开了一条渠道，把黄河的水引进来灌溉田地。卫河枯水季节，还可以送一些水过去通航。”他说，这条总干渠有52.5公里长。1952年开始施工。施工的那一年就灌溉了28万亩地，53年增到44万亩，54年又增到55万亩，55年是65万亩，56年估计可增到70万亩。
    为了说明问题，他举出几个数字：凡是灌了水的地比没灌的，棉花每亩多收101斤（籽棉），玉米一亩多收150斤，一般小麦多收20多斤，最高的多到62斤。
    一位留着八字胡上了年纪的同志带我到闸上去参观。这位同志搬弄着闸，操着重重的山西口音说：“那年毛主席到这里，还亲手搬过这闸呢！”由于叙述那一段有意义的愉快的往事，他的淳朴的脸孔发亮了。他接着说：“毛主席亲口对我们说：这个闸很重要，要好好保管。”
    别人介绍说，说话的这位老同志就是引黄灌溉济卫管理局渠首段的段长乔登云同志。
    看完闸以后，我们到地里走了一圈。乔登云同志说：“早先我很糊涂。1952年5月领导上把我调到这儿的时候，我思想搞不通。我给人说，这地方‘低头是河滩，抬头是荒山’调我来干啥？”
    “可是现在你瞧，我们除开了个渠道，还把这里的荒地改成良田！”按着乔登云同志手指的方向看去，见不远的地方有一大陇一大陇的田地，在稍远一点的地方，有一大片小树林。乔登云继续说下去：“我们除种了125亩的庄稼，还种了227亩的果树，那里面有苹果、有梨、有葡萄……”
    “水给庄稼人带来的好处就别提啦！”他微笑说，他常常到不远的村子里去。乡里的人见他可热火啦！就像见了自家的兄弟一样。他们说，要不是开了渠，那能打那么多粮食！
    乔登云同志接着说：“我们现在又在订计划，想在1957年上半年再多灌65万亩田。我们还打算最近在这里建筑个小发电站，作一个导流板沉淀泥沙！”
    望着那绵延地伸展在眼前的新的被开垦出来的土地，我想起了陕北人民歌唱黄河远景的一首歌子：
    远山高山森林山，近山低山花果山；
    川坪修成米粮川，干沟打坝聚湫滩；
    坡洼地里种牧草，山腰缓坡成梯田。
    到那时：
    牛羊成群，绿荫满山，生活更美满。
    眼下的景色不正是这样吗？
    若干年以后，当黄河上的46座水闸修好，不但河边沿岸家家田里有了水，而且家家户户都可以点上电灯，到那时人们从兰州坐上500吨的拖轮可顺流直下到海口！
