    Commemorating the 105th Anniversary of the Taiping Rebellion
    Fan Wenlan
    Today marks the 105th anniversary of the Taiping Rebellion, which began on January 11, 1851. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution persisted for over a decade, its influence spreading to 17 provinces. The heroic revolutionaries established their own state, organized a powerful army, implemented various revolutionary policies, mobilized vast numbers of peasants to fight for the overthrow of the feudal land system, and undertook the task of resisting foreign capitalist aggression. These heroic actions wrote a glorious page in Chinese history. Although the Taiping Rebellion was ultimately a purely peasant war without the leadership of the working class, and thus inevitably succumbed to the combined attack of domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries, the great revolutionary spirit demonstrated by the heroes of the Taiping Rebellion will forever be a source of pride for the Chinese people.

    Compared to all previous peasant wars, the Taiping Rebellion possessed more significant revolutionary programs and systems, such as the land program, the marriage system, and the military system, among others. Among these, the famous land program – the Land System of the Heavenly Dynasty – expressed the peasants' agricultural socialist ideology, that is, egalitarianism based on a small-scale peasant economy. Under certain historical conditions, this ideology had both tremendous revolutionary significance and, in essence, reactionary aspects.

    The Land System of the Heavenly Dynasty declared: "Allot land according to population, regardless of men or women, based on the number of people in the household; more people, more land; fewer people, less land… All till the land together, all eat together, all dress together, all use money together; nowhere is there inequality, no one is not fed and clothed." The method of land distribution was to divide land into nine classes: the highest class of land yielded 1,200 catties of grain per mu in two seasons, early and late; for each 100 catties less in yield, the land was lowered one class; land yielding 400 catties per year was the lowest class. One mu of the highest class of land was equivalent to 1.1 mu of the middle-upper class of land, and equivalent to a certain amount of other classes of land. "For a family of six, three would be allotted good land, and three would be allotted poor land, half good and half poor. All land under heaven is to be cultivated by all people under heaven; if there is a shortage here, move to there; if there is a shortage there, move to here." This idea permeated the hearts of millions of peasants, becoming a source of unlimited power in the struggle for land. Wherever the Taiping army arrived, landlords fled in panic, peasants responded enthusiastically, and the revolutionary tide fiercely impacted the foundations of the feudal system, accelerating the collapse of the Qing dynasty. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's land program demanded the re-equalization of land and property according to new principles. The program proposed eliminating landlord ownership and establishing peasant land ownership, thereby enabling peasants to acquire land and be freed from feudal oppression, which was entirely in line with the demands of the peasants at the time. Therefore, this proposition was revolutionary.

    However, due to the limitations of the era, their attempt to consolidate small-scale peasant land ownership was, in essence, reactionary. For example, according to the provisions of the Land System of the Heavenly Dynasty, peasants who were allotted land were to maintain a small-scale peasant economy with a few mu of land, a few mulberry trees, five hens, and two pigs per household. Moreover, all annual harvests, except for necessities, were to be handed over to the public treasury. Matters such as weddings and celebrations after childbirth were to be paid for by the national treasury. The Land System of the Heavenly Dynasty stipulated: "Whenever it is harvest time, the two Sima supervisors and the Wuzhang shall, after providing each person in the twenty-five households with enough food to last until the new grain, return the remainder to the national treasury. The same applies to wheat, beans, ramie, hemp, cloth, chickens, dogs, and all other goods and silver. … All weddings and childbirth celebrations within the twenty-five households are to be paid for by the national treasury, but there are limits, and no more than one penny is to be used. For example, if a family has a wedding or childbirth celebration, they will be given 1,000 cash and 100 catties of grain, and this is the same throughout the world." They imagined that every peasant could forever maintain an equal share of property based on a scattered small-scale peasant economy. This egalitarian approach, even if realized, would not enable peasants to improve production tools and farming techniques, and would not allow for the large-scale development of agricultural production. The future of the peasants would still be bleak. The reactionary nature of this fantasy, which violated the laws of social development, is clearly visible.

    Nevertheless, Lenin pointed out in his article "Two Utopias" that the utopia of the Russian Narodniks once played a progressive role in history. Lenin said: "The 'egalitarianism' of land redistribution is a utopia, but in order to redistribute land, it is necessary to completely break with all old, landlord, allotment, 'official,' etc., land ownership, which is the most necessary, economically progressive, and most urgent method for a country like Russia in the direction of bourgeois democracy." The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's land program was precisely this kind of relatively thorough land program. In an era when capitalism was not yet developed in China, regardless of the subjective wishes of the leaders of the Taiping Rebellion, the Taiping Rebellion objectively opened up prospects for the development of capitalism. Therefore, according to the historical conditions in which the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was situated, the agricultural socialist proposition was still primarily progressive.

    In the semi-colonial and semi-feudal Chinese society, imperialism and feudal forces would never allow capitalism to develop; the spontaneous Taiping Rebellion of the peasant class, as well as the Xinhai Revolution led by the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois classes, had no choice but to declare defeat under the combined oppression of domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries. However, the broad masses of peasants did not stop fighting to realize their revolutionary demands simply because they suffered defeat.

    Lenin taught: "Marxists must, of course, carefully distinguish the healthy, valuable, sincere, resolute, and militant democratic kernel of the peasant masses from the utopian shell of the Narodniks." In China, carefully distinguishing this valuable democratic kernel is naturally an important task of the Communist Party of China.

    In 1927, Comrade Mao Zedong published the Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan, which was an extremely brilliant and profound distinction of Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The main force that has been fighting bitterly in the countryside has always been the poor peasants. From the secret period to the public period, the poor peasants have been actively fighting there. They listen most to the leadership of the Communist Party. They are mortal enemies with the local tyrants and evil gentry, and they unhesitatingly attack the bastions of the local tyrants and evil gentry." He also pointed out: "This vast mass of poor peasants, accounting for 70 percent of the rural population, is the backbone of the peasant associations, the vanguard in overthrowing feudal forces, and the meritorious force in accomplishing the revolutionary cause that has not been accomplished for many years. Without the poor peasant class (in the words of the gentry, without the 'riffraff'), it would be impossible to create the current revolutionary state in the countryside, it would be impossible to overthrow the local tyrants and evil gentry, and it would be impossible to complete the democratic revolution." The Communist Party of China found the democratic kernel of the peasant masses, thereby generating endless power. With this power, everything became easier for the Chinese revolutionary cause.

    The Taiping Rebellion was a spontaneous revolution of the peasants, without the leadership of the working class. Although the main force of the uprising was the poor peasants, the masses who responded in various places were first and foremost the poor peasants, and the main force that fought to defend the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom against landlords, bullies, and foreign aggressors was still the poor peasants, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's land program only spoke of loyalty and treachery, and of "being virtuous and good, or being promoted or rewarded," and "being evil and stubborn, or being punished," but it could not clearly distinguish between revolution and counter-revolution from a class perspective. Therefore, while the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom attacked landlords, it also left loopholes for landlords to operate. Especially in the later period of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, some areas even selected "substantial households" to be village officials, allowing landlords to infiltrate the revolutionary regime; some areas even issued protection certificates to landlords, protecting the interests of landlords. This undermined the revolutionary land program and other policies. From a comparison between the Taiping Rebellion and the New Democratic Revolution and Socialist Revolution led by the Communist Party of China, we can clearly understand that although the poor peasants were the main driving force of the Chinese revolution, they still could not achieve revolutionary victory without the leadership of the working class. Only by heading towards socialism under the leadership of the working class can the peasants be completely liberated.

    In the Taiping Rebellion, Chinese peasants demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary spirit and patriotism. Now, the ranks of more than 500 million Chinese peasants, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China, are carrying forward the excellent revolutionary traditions and are marching vigorously from semi-socialist agricultural cooperation to fully socialist agricultural cooperation. This event will play a very important role not only in the history of the Chinese revolution but also in the history of the revolution of all mankind.

    纪念太平天国起义105周年
    范文澜
    1851年1月11日太平天国起义，到今天正是105周年。太平天国革命，前后坚持了十多年，势力扩展到17省。革命的英雄们建立了自己的国家，组织了强大的军队，实行了多种革命的政策，发动了广大农民为推翻封建的土地制度而斗争，并且担负起反抗外国资本主义侵略势力的任务。这些英雄行动在中国历史上写下了光辉的一页。太平天国革命仍旧是没有工人阶级领导的单纯农民战争，不能不在中外反革命联合进攻之下归于失败，但是太平天国革命的英雄们所表现的伟大的革命精神，中国人民是永远引以自豪的。
    太平天国革命比起过去一切农民战争来，有着更加显著的革命的纲领、制度，例如土地纲领、婚姻制度和军事制度，等等。其中，著名的土地纲领——天朝田亩制度，表现了农民的农业社会主义思想，即以小农经济为基础的平均主义思想。这种思想在一定的历史条件下，一方面有巨大的革命性，另一方面在实质上又带有反动性。
    天朝田亩制度宣布：“凡分田照人口，不论男妇，算其家口多寡，人多则分多，人寡则分寡……有田同耕，有饭同食，有衣同穿，有钱同使，无处不均匀，无人不饱暖”。分田的办法，是把土地分为九等，一亩早晚二季产粮1，200斤者为上上田，产量减100斤降低一等，年产400斤者为下下田。上上田一亩折合上中田一亩一分，折合其他各等田若干。“如一家六人，分三人好田，分三人丑田，好丑各一半。凡天下田天下人同耕，此处不足则迁彼处，彼处不足则迁此处。”这种主张渗透了千千万万农民的心，在争取土地的斗争中成为无限力量的源泉。凡是太平军到达的地方，地主抱头鼠窜，农民热烈响应，革命高潮猛烈地冲击封建制度的基础，加速清朝政权的崩溃。太平天国的土地纲领要求根据新的原则，重新平分土地财产。纲领提出消灭地主所有制，建立农民土地所有制，从而使得农民获得土地，解除封建压迫，这是完全合乎当时农民的要求的。因此，这种主张是革命的。
    但是，由于时代条件的限制，他们企图把小农的土地所有制巩固起来，这在实质上是带有反动性的。比如，按照天朝田亩制度的规定，农民分得土地就要保持每家有几亩地，几棵桑，五只母鸡，两口猪的小农经济的生活。并且，农民每年的收获所得，除必需者外，一律归公，缴入国库。如有婚娶弥月之事，概由国库开支。天朝田亩制度规定：“凡当收成时，两司马督伍长，除足其二十五家每人所食可接新谷外，余则归国库。凡麦豆苎麻布帛鸡犬各物及银钱亦然。……凡二十五家中所有娶婚弥月喜事俱用国库，但有限式，不得多用一钱。如一家有婚娶弥月事给钱一千，谷一百斤，通天下皆一式”。他们幻想每个农民都在分散的小农经济基础上永远保持一份平均的财产。这种平均主义的做法，即使实现了，也不可能使农民改进生产工具和耕作技术，不可能使农业生产大量发展。农民的前途还很黯淡。这种违反社会发展规律的空想，它的反动性质是显然可见的。
    虽然如此，列宁在“两种乌托邦”一文里指出，俄国民粹派的乌托邦在历史上曾经有过进步作用。列宁说：“土地重分底‘平均性’是乌托邦，但是为了重分土地而必须实行与一切旧的，地主的，份地的，‘官家的’等等土地所有制完全断绝关系，却是在资产阶级民主主义方向上最需要的，经济上进步的，对于俄国这样的国家最为迫切的办法。”太平天国的土地纲领，正是这种比较彻底的土地纲领。在中国资本主义还未发展的年代里，不管太平天国革命领导者的主观愿望如何，太平天国革命在客观上却为资本主义的发展开辟了前途。所以，按照太平天国所处的历史条件，农业社会主义的主张，进步的一面还是主要的。
    在半殖民地半封建的中国社会里，帝国主义和封建势力决不允许资本主义发展起来；农民阶级自发的太平天国革命，以至资产阶级小资产阶级领导的辛亥革命，都不得不在中外反革命联合压迫下宣告失败。但是，广大农民群众为了实现革命的要求，并不因为遭受失败而停止斗争。
    列宁教导说：“马克思主义者自然应当从民粹派乌托邦外壳中间，把农民群众健全宝贵的诚恳坚决战斗民主主义内核细心分辨出来”。在中国，细心地把这种宝贵民主主义内核分辨出来，自然是中国共产党的重要任务。
    1927年，毛泽东同志发表湖南农民运动考察报告，就是马克思列宁主义极其辉煌极其深刻的分辨。毛泽东同志指出：“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农。从秘密时期到公开时期，贫农都在那里积极奋斗。他们最听共产党的领导。他们和土豪劣绅是死对头，他们毫不迟疑地向土豪劣绅营垒进攻。”又指出：“这个贫农大群众，合共占乡村人口百分之七十，乃是农民协会的中坚，打倒封建势力的先锋，成就那多年未曾成就的革命大业的元勋。没有贫农阶级（照绅士的话说，没有‘痞子’），决不能造成现时乡村的革命状态，决不能打倒土豪劣绅，完成民主革命。”中国共产党找到了农民群众这个民主主义的内核，从而产生出无穷无尽的力量。有了这个力量，中国的革命事业一切都好办了。
    太平天国革命是农民自发的革命，没有工人阶级的领导。固然起义的主力是贫农，各地响应的群众首先是贫农，为保卫太平天国而向地主恶霸和外国侵略者斗争的主力还是贫农，可是太平天国的土地纲领只说到了忠和奸，说到了“为贤为良，或举或赏”，“为恶为顽，或诛或罚”，却不能从阶级关系上明确划分革命和反革命。因此，太平天国一方面打击地主，一方面又给地主留下了活动的空隙。特别是太平天国晚期，一些地区竟选拔“殷实之家”为乡官，使地主混入革命政权；个别地区甚至给地主颁发护凭，保护地主的利益。这就破坏了革命的土地纲领和其他政策。从太平天国革命同中国共产党所领导的新民主主义革命和社会主义革命对比看来，我们就可清楚了解，贫农固然是中国革命的主要动力，但是他们如无工人阶级领导，还是不能取得革命的胜利的。只有在工人阶级领导下走向社会主义，农民才能得到彻底解放。
      在太平天国革命运动里，中国农民曾经表现了高度的革命气魄和爱国主义精神。现在，五亿以上的中国农民队伍，在伟大的中国共产党领导下，发扬优秀的革命传统，浩浩荡荡地通过半社会主义的农业合作化走向全社会主义的农业合作化。这一事件，不仅对中国革命的历史，而且对全人类革命的历史，都将起着非常重要的作用。
