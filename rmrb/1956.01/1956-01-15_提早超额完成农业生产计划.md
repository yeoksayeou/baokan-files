Fulfilling Agricultural Production Plans Ahead of Schedule and Exceeding Targets

	1956 will be a year of rapid progress in China's agricultural production. According to the decisions of the National Agricultural Work Conference in December last year, this year's grain, cotton, and other crops will increase significantly compared to the bumper year of 1955. It is expected that both grain and cotton will increase by more than 10%. This is an ambitious yet realistic plan. Striving to fully realize this plan will greatly advance China's agricultural production on the basis of last year's bumper harvest.

	Can this plan be realized? Is it possible to increase grain and cotton production so much? Calculating the various favorable conditions, this plan can be realized. First, before the spring plowing this year, most parts of the country will basically achieve semi-socialist agricultural collectivization. The high tide of agricultural production that comes with the high tide of agricultural collectivization has already appeared. If 90% of agricultural producers' cooperatives increase production by 10%, then not only will this plan be completed, but it will also be exceeded. Second, last year's national bumper harvest increased the farmers' ability to invest in reproduction. In order to realize the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the state's financial and material support for agriculture has also greatly increased compared to previous years. Third, from the province to the township, the focus of work of Party and government leading organs at all levels has more clearly shifted to agricultural production centered on collectivization. Many provinces and regions have proposed and implemented effective measures to rapidly increase agricultural production. The vigorous production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers has received positive and strong leadership, which is the decisive condition for realizing the production increase plan.

	The conditions are very favorable, and the potential for increasing production is great. What is now placed before the leading organs at all levels is to strive to explore and utilize these potential capabilities, lead the national farmers, and fulfill the targets of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets. After the closing of the National Agricultural Work Conference, the leading organs in most regions, in accordance with the spirit of the conference, appropriately revised and increased the production increase targets, determined practical and feasible production increase measures, and led the farmers to set off a lively winter production movement, truly realizing the slogan of "turning winter idleness into winter busyness."

	However, not everyone recognizes these favorable conditions. Some people are still timid and hesitant when formulating agricultural production plan targets. They believe that after years of hard work, the potential for agricultural production increase has been almost fully tapped, and it is possible to increase it a little more, but it is not possible to increase it a lot. It can be said with certainty that people with this kind of thinking do not understand the actual situation and do not go deep into the masses. They are dominated by right-leaning conservative thinking and cannot see the living reality. They should go to the countryside, conduct investigations and research, and humbly learn from the masses. As long as they go deep into the actual situation, they will surely be full of confidence and learn methods. The Liaocheng Prefectural Committee of Shandong Province has set a very good example in this regard. In October last year, the Liaocheng Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of activists, put forward the slogan of overcoming conservative thinking and welcoming the high tide of production, and stipulated that 1956 should increase grain production by 8% compared to 1955, and strive to increase production by 12%. After the meeting, the responsible personnel of the Prefectural Committee went deep into the masses to investigate and study, and criticized right-leaning conservative thinking at the provincial agricultural production conference convened by the Provincial Committee, raising the grain production increase target to 40% more than in 1955. Later, the comrades of the Prefectural Committee went deep into the countryside to investigate and analyze the production potential, specifically study the methods of increasing production, and finally raised the grain production increase target to 50% more than in 1955. After the realization of agricultural collectivization, many conditions that could not be utilized and potentials that could not be tapped in the era when the small-scale peasant economy dominated can be utilized and tapped. Under this new situation, the proportion of production increase is often not a few percent, but a dozen or dozens of percent.

	Some people worry about the sudden attacks of natural disasters. Indeed, under the current conditions, it is still impossible to completely avoid the attacks of natural disasters. When formulating agricultural production increase plans, this factor should be appropriately considered. However, countless facts have long proven that relying on the great power of collectivization, we can greatly reduce natural disasters and take effective measures to remedy them. On this issue, the correct attitude is to actively utilize the favorable factors in natural conditions, overcome unfavorable factors, and use all possible methods to ensure the complete realization of the production increase plan. Wen County, Henan Province, has often suffered from droughts and floods throughout the years, and the unit yield of farmland is not high. Now, the county party committee has grasped the favorable condition that 80% of the county's farmers have already joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, and is determined to dig 8,100 wells and install 1,300 waterwheels in 1956 and 1957, plus river drainage projects, to expand the county's irrigated land to 90% of the cultivated area. In this way, the county's average yield per mu can be increased from 337 jin to 384 jin, and general droughts and floods are not enough to worry about. Whether in the south or the north, whether along the coast or inland, there are many counties and districts that have adopted this active attitude, demonstrating the heroic spirit of fighting against natural disasters. Why can most areas do this, but some areas cannot? Why are some people brave and some people cowardly? On this issue, we should also believe in the leadership of the Party and the power of the masses, and we should believe in the truth that "man can conquer nature." The broad masses of farmers are determined to carry out a heroic struggle against natural disasters, and leading organs at all levels should walk in front of them.

	In order to fulfill the agricultural production increase target ahead of schedule and exceed targets, we must seize the time to prepare. Currently, it is the season to build farmland water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizer, improve soil, strengthen field management of overwintering crops, and eliminate pests of overwintering crops. According to the situation in various places, we must guarantee the quantity and quality, and complete these urgent measures within a time limit. All localities should seize the opportunity before the Spring Festival to rectify all newly built cooperatives, properly handle the means of production entering the society, establish labor organizations in a timely manner, and make comprehensive plans as soon as possible, so that various winter production activities can be carried out in an orderly manner, taking care of all aspects and doing well at the same time. The farmers' production enthusiasm is very high, but they have difficulties in large-scale production movements. For example, farmers in some areas in the south lack experience in large-scale farmland water conservancy construction in winter, which is a difficulty. We must strengthen specific guidance, promote various advanced experiences, and help farmers overcome these difficulties.

	People have already admitted that it is entirely possible to speed up now. Everyone must do their part to complete the agricultural Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceed targets. Workers and staff in the industrial sector must manufacture more and better agricultural machinery, instruments, chemical fertilizers, and daily necessities for farmers. Staff of state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperative departments must transport various products manufactured in factories to the countryside in a timely manner. Staff in the financial and monetary departments must enable the state's financial support for farmers to play a greater role and issue various loans to farmers in a timely manner. Personnel in agricultural departments at all levels must step up the training of agricultural technicians and farmer technicians, and quickly transport fine seeds to the countryside. Experts from scientific research and health departments must strive to effectively help farmers eliminate diseases and pests, harmful animals and harmful birds and insects. All parties work together to ensure that great achievements are made on the agricultural front in 1956!

### 提早超额完成农业生产计划

    提早超额完成农业生产计划
    1956年将是我国农业生产突飞猛进的一年。按照去年12月全国农业工作会议的决定，今年的粮食、棉花和别的农作物，都要比丰收的1955年有很大程度的增产。预计粮食和棉花都要增产10％以上。这是一个富有理想而又实事求是的计划。努力争取完满地实现这个计划，就会使我国的农业生产在去年丰收的基础上大大前进一步。
    这个计划能够实现吗？粮食、棉花增产这么多，这是可能作到的吗？把各种有利条件计算一下，这个计划是能够实现的。第一、今年春耕以前，全国大部地区将要基本上实现半社会主义的农业合作化。随着农业合作化高潮而来的农业生产高潮已经出现了。如果90％的农业生产合作社都增产10％，那就不仅能够完成、而且还会超过这个计划。第二、去年全国丰收，农民投资再生产的力量增大了。为了提早实现五年计划，国家支援农业的财政力量和物质力量也比往年大为增加。第三、从省到乡，各级党政领导机关的工作重心，更加明确地转移到以合作化为中心的农业生产方面来。许多省、区已经提出和实行了迅速提高农业生产的有效措施。广大农民蓬蓬勃勃的生产热情，已经得到积极的有力的领导，这就是实现增产计划的决定条件。
    条件非常有利，增产潜力很大，现在摆到各级领导机关面前的是要努力发掘和运用这些潜在能力，领导全国农民，提早和超额完成五年计划的指标。全国农业工作会议闭幕以后，多数地区的领导机关根据会议的精神，都适当地修改和提高了增产指标，确定了切实可行的增产措施，领导农民掀起热火朝天的冬季生产运动，真正实现了“变冬闲为冬忙”的口号。
    但是，并不是每一个人都认识了这些有利的条件。有些人在拟定农业生产计划指标的时候，还是小手小脚。他们认为经过多年的努力，农业增产潜力已经挖得差不多，再提高一点是可能的，提高很多就不行了。可以肯定地说，有这种思想的人是不了解实际的人，不深入群众的人，他们受了右倾保守思想的支配，看不见活生生的现实；他们应该到农村去，进行调查研究，虚心向群众学习。只要深入实际，就一定会充满信心，学到办法。山东聊城地委在这一方面做出了很好的榜样。去年10月份，中共聊城地委召开活动分子会议，提出克服保守思想和迎接生产高潮的口号，规定1956年要比1955年增产粮食8％，争取增产12％。会议以后，地委负责人员深入群众调查研究，又在省委召开的全省农业生产会议上批判了右倾保守思想，把粮食增产指标提高到比1955年增加40％。以后，地委的同志们又深入乡村，调查分析生产潜力，具体研究增产办法，最后又把粮食增产指标提高到比1955年增加50％。在农业合作化实现以后，许多在小农经济占优势的时代所不能利用的条件都能利用，不能挖掘的潜力都能挖掘出来；在这种新的情况下面，增产的比例常常不是百分之几，而是百分之十几或几十。
    有人担心自然灾害的突然袭击。的确，在目前的条件下面，还不可能完全避免自然灾害的袭击。在制定农业增产计划的时候，应该适当地考虑这个因素。但是，无数事实早已证明，依靠合作化的伟大力量，我们完全能够使自然灾害大为减轻，并且能够采取有效措施加以补救。在这个问题上，正确的态度是积极利用自然条件中的有利因素，克服不利因素，用尽各种办法，保证增产计划完满实现。河南省温县历年常有旱灾和涝灾，农田单位产量不高。现在，县委掌握了全县80％的农户已经参加农业生产合作社的有利条件，决心在1956和1957两年凿井8，100眼，安装水车1，300部，加上河道排水工程，把全县水浇地扩大到耕地面积的90％。这样，全县每亩平均产量可以从337斤提高到384斤，一般的旱涝灾害，都不足为患了。不论南方、北方，不论沿海、内地，都有许多县区采取了这种积极的态度，表现了同自然灾害作斗争的英雄气概。为什么多数地区可以这样，有些地区却不能这样作呢？为什么有人勇敢，有人怯懦呢？在这个问题上，同样地应该相信党的领导和群众的力量，应该相信“人定胜天”的道理。广大农民有决心向自然灾害进行英勇的斗争，各级领导机关应该走在他们的前面。
    为了提早和超额完成农业增产的目标，必须抓紧时间进行准备。目前正是兴修农田水利、积肥、改良土壤、加强过冬作物的田间管理、消灭过冬作物害虫的季节。必须按照各地的情况，保证数量和质量，限期完成这些紧要的措施。各地都应该抓紧春节以前的时机，把全部新建的合作社整顿一遍，妥善地处理入社的生产资料，及时地建立劳动组织，尽快地作好全面规划，使各种冬季生产活动能够有条不紊地进行，多方兼顾，同时作好。农民的生产情绪是很高的，但是，他们在大规模生产运动中是有困难的。例如，南方一些地区的农民缺乏在冬季大规模兴修农田水利的经验，这就是困难。我们一定要加强具体指导，推广各种先进经验，帮助农民克服这些困难。
    人们都已承认现在加快速度是完全可能的了。每一个人都要为提前和超额完成农业的五年计划尽一份力量。工业部门的工人和职员们，必须给农民制造更多更好的农业机器、药械、化学肥料和日常用品。国营商业和供销合作部门的工作人员，要把工厂中制造的各种产品及时地运到农村去。财政金融部门的工作人员，要使国家支援农民的财政力量发挥更大的作用，把各种贷款及时地发到农民手里。各级农业部门的人员，要加紧训练农业技术员和农民技术手，迅速调运优良种籽到农村去。科学研究和卫生部门的专家们，要努力有效地帮助农民扑灭疾病和害兽害鸟害虫。各方面共同努力，保证1956年在农业战线上做出巨大的成绩来！
