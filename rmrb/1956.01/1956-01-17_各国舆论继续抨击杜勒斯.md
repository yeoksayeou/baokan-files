    Continued Criticism of Dulles by Public Opinion in Various Countries

    United States

    American newspapers continue to criticize Dulles's talk about the "brink of war" policy.

    James Reston, the chief Washington correspondent for "The New York Times," wrote that Dulles's talk "added something new to the art of making diplomatic mistakes." Reston said, "This is a planned mistake. He doesn't stumble into hidden traps; he digs them larger to fit his size, examines them carefully, and then jumps in."

    "The Christian Science Monitor" believes that Dulles's talk about "America having nearly started a war" sounds "embarrassing."

    An editorial in "The New York Post" believes that the most important thing now is the implication: the strategy of atomic retaliation is still the main weapon of American foreign policy, and the State Department's "activities are still based on the antiquated principle of planned risk-taking that seemed justifiable before the invention of the atomic bomb."

    Britain

    "The Reynolds News" called Dulles's policy of brandishing atomic weapons "suicidal madness," and the editorial said: "Now is the time to speak to Dulles in the simplest language. He should be told that the British people resolutely refuse to be drawn into a nuclear war, which could break out one day when Dulles goes too far."

    "The Observer" accused Dulles of "having an unfortunate genius for creating inappropriate slogans."

    Referring to Eden's upcoming visit to the United States, the newspaper demanded that this Washington meeting "seriously reconsider" the current "reckless" stance of Britain and the United States on the issue of atomic weapons. Furthermore, the newspaper wrote: "It is also necessary to consider the US attitude towards the recognition of the Beijing government and the status of the Chinese coastal islands if it is hoped to improve the West's prestige in the eyes of independent Asian countries."

    Fenner Brockway, a Labour MP in the House of Commons, wrote in "The Sunday Pictorial" today that Dulles's remarks are "one of the most chilling statements in recent times." Fenner Brockway said: "If Dulles's talk is a trick to win the upcoming US election, then one thing is very clear: we cannot take risks and allow Western policy to be treated as a plaything for ambitious American politicians." Fenner Brockway urged Britain to embark on "formulating a new policy in line with the new international situation."

    India

    An editorial in "The Hindustan Standard" pointed out that the peace in Korea, Indochina, and other places was achieved not because of Dulles's "threats, bluffs, and ranting," but because of the efforts of other countries. The newspaper said, "If the United States thinks it can restore the previous situation of Cold War tension, it is greatly mistaken."

    "The Indian Express" pointed out that although all sensible people believe that the cessation of hostilities in Korea and Indochina is a victory for justice rather than a victory for power, Dulles attributes it to the skill of his art of going to the brink of war. The newspaper said, "Attempting to force others to reach an agreement with the threat of mass destruction is foolish and is bound to be futile."

    Denmark

    The "Left-Wing Newspaper" in Holbæk said: "It is wrong to think that the security of our world depends on atomic weapons. On the contrary, atomic weapons are fatally dangerous to us," and waging atomic war is "a risk that humanity cannot allow."

### 各国舆论继续抨击杜勒斯

    各国舆论继续抨击杜勒斯
    美国
    美国报纸继续抨击杜勒斯关于“战争边缘”政策的谈话。
    “纽约时报”驻华盛顿首席记者赖斯顿写道，杜勒斯的谈话“给犯外交错误的艺术增加了一些新东西”。赖斯顿说：“这是有计划的错误。他不是失足堕入隐藏的陷阱之中，他按照身材把它们挖大了，仔细地打量它们，然后跳下去。”
    “基督教科学箴言报”认为杜勒斯关于“美国曾经险些发动战争”的谈话听来“是令人感到难堪的”。
    “纽约邮报”的社论认为：现在最重要的在于这种含意：原子报复战略仍然是美国外交政策的主要武器，而且国务院的“活动仍然是根据在发明原子弹以前似乎还讲得过去的那种有计划的冒险的陈腐原则”。
    英国
    “雷诺新闻”把杜勒斯的挥舞原子武器的政策称为“导向自杀的疯狂”，社论说：“现在是用最简单的语言向杜勒斯讲话的时候了。应该告诉他：英国人民断然拒绝卷入核子战争，当杜勒斯有一天做得过份的时候，这种核子战争就可能爆发。”
    “观察家报”指责杜勒斯“有一种制造不适当的口号的倒霉的天才。”
    这家报纸在谈到艾登即将访问美国的事情时，要求这一次华盛顿会谈“认真地重新考虑一下”英国和美国目前在原子武器问题上的“轻率”立场。此外，这家报纸写道：“还必须考虑一下美国对承认北京政府和对中国沿海岛屿的地位的态度，如果希望提高西方在亚洲独立国家面前的威信的话。”
    下院工党议员芬堡今天在“星期日画报”上著文，认为杜勒斯的言论是“近来最令人寒心的言论之一”。芬堡说：“如果杜勒斯的谈话是为了玩弄花招，想在即将到来的美国选举中得胜，那末有一点是十分明显的：我们不能挺而走险和允许把西方的政策当作是野心勃勃的美国政客的玩物”。芬堡劝英国着手“拟订符合于新的国际局势的新政策”。
    印度
    “印度斯坦旗报”的社论指出，在朝鲜、印度支那等地，和平所以能够实现，并不是由于杜勒斯的“威胁、虚声恫吓和狂言诈语”，而是由于其他国家的努力。这家报纸说：“如果美国认为它能够恢复以前的冷战紧张局势的情况，那它就大错特错了。”
    “印度快报”指出，虽然一切有理智的人认为朝鲜、印度支那敌对行动的停止是公理的胜利而不是强权的胜利，但是杜勒斯却归功于他的走到战争边缘的艺术的技巧。这家报纸说，“企图用大规模毁灭的威胁来强迫别人达成协议是愚蠢的，而且必定是毫无用处的。”
    丹麦
    荷尔贝克区“左翼报”说：“认为我们世界的安全要依靠原子武器，那是错误的。相反的，原子武器对我们有致命的危险”，进行原子战争是“人性所不能允许的冒险”。　（据新华社讯）
