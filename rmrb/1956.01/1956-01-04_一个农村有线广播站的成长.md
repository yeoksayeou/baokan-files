　　The Growth of a Rural Wired Broadcasting Station
　　Lu Ye

　　The Jiutai Wired Broadcasting Station is one of the earliest rural wired broadcasting stations established in our country. It officially began broadcasting on April 1, 1952.

　　Jiutai County is a medium-sized county in Jilin Province. Over 90% of the villages in the county have established propaganda networks. Telephone lines are erected between the county town, districts, and villages, and each village has a telephone. This is one of the important conditions for establishing a rural wired broadcasting station.

　　The Jiutai Wired Broadcasting Station now has two 500-watt amplifiers and one 250-watt amplifier. The total length of the lines is 2,100 li, with a total of 876 loudspeakers installed along the lines, distributed in 22 districts and 180 administrative villages throughout the county (the county has a total of 200 administrative villages). Some of these loudspeakers are installed in agricultural producers' cooperative clubs, some in elementary schools, village people's committees, and major street intersections in each village.

　　According to the plan for building a rural broadcasting network in Jiutai County, another 2,000 loudspeakers will be installed from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956. In addition, three radio-electrified villages will be built on a trial basis (where every household has a loudspeaker), and a high-volume loudspeaker will be installed in the location of each district people's committee. By the end of 1956, another 3,500 loudspeakers will be installed, and by the end of 1957, another 3,500 loudspeakers will be installed. In this way, during the first Five-Year Plan period, there will be 10,000 loudspeakers distributed throughout the rural areas of the county, averaging one loudspeaker for every six or seven households.

　　When the Jiutai Wired Broadcasting Station began construction, the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee affirmed that, because Jiutai County is mainly engaged in agricultural production, wired broadcasting should face the countryside, serve agricultural production, and appropriately meet the cultural needs of farmers. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the broadcasting station, after exploration, further determined the policy for running programs: based on the needs and acceptance ability of the masses, retransmission should be the main focus, and self-produced programs should be supplementary. The main content of self-produced programs is to promote agricultural cooperation, encourage the labor enthusiasm of farmers, and improve agricultural production through the introduction of advanced figures and advanced experiences, and to appropriately meet the cultural life requirements of farmers. According to this policy, for three years, the broadcasting station has played a significant role in conducting current affairs and political education for farmers, publicizing the policies and laws of the Party and the government, disseminating cultural, scientific, and health knowledge, and mobilizing farmers to quickly complete urgent tasks. For example, in early September 1954, there was a frost warning. The broadcasting station made an emergency mobilization the day before, and more than 400 cadres across the county led the masses to immediately carry out frost prevention work, which resulted in more than 15,000 hectares of late-maturing crops being saved from disaster. In mid-November 1955, the Jiutai County Party Committee held a broadcasting conference, which conveyed Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party on the question of agricultural cooperation through the wired broadcasting station. More than 20,000 people attended this broadcasting conference. This broadcasting conference yielded great results: First, in the past, more than 1,000 cadres had to go to the county for a "three-level meeting," and food, lodging, and travel expenses would cost at least 7,000 yuan. This money could be used to build a wired broadcasting station. Replacing the "three-level meeting" with a broadcasting conference not only saved this money but also did not delay work and production. Second, it enabled Party branches in all areas, especially those far from the county town, to directly hear the county party committee's transmission, quickly solving their difficulties in propaganda. Third, this broadcasting conference further inspired the socialist enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers.

　　Currently, the Jiutai Wired Broadcasting Station broadcasts twice a day, from 11:00 AM to 12:50 PM at noon, and from 6:00 PM to 8:25 PM in the evening, for a total of 4 hours and 15 minutes. In addition to retransmitting the news programs "Broadcast to the Countryside" and "Joint Broadcast Program" from the Central People's Broadcasting Station and the programs of the Jilin Provincial People's Broadcasting Station, it also produces its own programs such as "Cooperative Experience," "Rural Correspondence," "Ideological Talks," rural production situations and experiences, challenge and response conditions for production competitions among mutual aid groups, criticisms and commendations, notices and instructions, and reports and speeches by leading working staff and labor models. In addition, there are opera and beautiful folk music programs that are welcomed by farmers. Although the time is not long, the 10- to 20-minute self-produced programs are filled with various advanced figures and seven or eight speeches, manuscripts, and letters of various content and forms from the audience, effectively and compactly conveying all aspects of rural production and life, and conveying the voices of the broad masses of the countryside. The rural wired broadcasting station, as a hub, connects farmers within a radius of 150 li.

　　The main reasons for the Jiutai Wired Broadcasting Station's success are the attention of the leading organs and the support of the masses. In the summer of 1952, the Jilin Provincial Party Committee affirmed the policy of developing rural wired broadcasting at the provincial Party propaganda work conference and began to promote Jiutai County's experience in developing wired broadcasting. The Jiutai County Party Committee had long made the decision to "definitely bring the loudspeakers to the countryside and definitely let the farmers hear the broadcast." After the broadcasting station was built, the County Party Committee regarded the wired broadcasting station as "half of the propaganda work," and instructed the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee to directly lead the work of the broadcasting station. At various relevant meetings, the responsible comrades of the County Party Committee often pointed out the educational role of broadcasting for the rural masses. When arranging the central work, the County Party Committee also specifically requested that cadres organize manuscripts for the broadcasting station and assist in organizing listening, etc. In addition, the relevant meetings of the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee often included the director of the broadcasting station.

　　The broad masses of farmers have a very high enthusiasm for building wired broadcasting stations. Especially at present, when the cooperation movement in Jiutai County is booming, the construction of the rural broadcasting network has received strong support from the farmers. In the past, more than 50% of the Jiutai Wired Broadcasting Station's own overhead lines were supported by poles provided by the farmers themselves, and all the loudspeakers were purchased by the farmers themselves. Over the past three years, there have been many moving stories of farmers automatically maintaining lines and repairing wires and poles throughout the county. Recently, Jiutai County proposed to expand the broadcasting station, and the farmers have expressed their willingness to contribute manpower and money, hoping to bring the loudspeakers to their villages, cooperatives, courtyards, and houses from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956. This fully demonstrates the farmers' enthusiasm for building a rural broadcasting network.

　　一个农村有线广播站的成长
    鹿野
    九台有线广播站是我国最早建立的一座农村有线广播站。它是1952年4月1日正式播音的。
    九台县是吉林省的一个中等县份。全县90％以上的村庄都建立了宣传网，县城和各区、村之间都架有电话线，每个村子都有电话机。这是建立农村有线广播站的重要条件之一。
    九台有线广播站现在有五百瓦的扩音机两部，250瓦的扩音机一部。线路共长2，100华里，全线共安设了876个喇叭，分布在全县22个区、180个行政村（全县共有二百个行政村）。这些喇叭有的安设在农业生产合作社俱乐部，有的安设在小学校、村人民委员会和各村的主要街口上。
    根据九台县建设农村广播网的规划，1955年冬到1956年春要再安装二千个喇叭，另外试建三个无线电化村（就是每院都有喇叭），每个区人民委员会所在地都安一个高音喇叭。1956年底要再安3，500个喇叭，1957年底，再安3，500个喇叭。这样在第一个五年计划期间，就可以有一万个喇叭分布在全县农村当中，平均每六、七户就有一个喇叭。
    九台有线广播站开始建设的时候，县委宣传部就肯定：由于九台县是以农业生产为主，有线广播应该面向农村，为农业生产服务，适当满足农民的文化要求。广播站在党委领导下，经过摸索，进一步确定了办节目的方针是：根据群众的需要和接受能力，以转播为主，自播为辅。自办节目的主要内容是通过先进人物和先进经验的介绍，推动农业合作化，鼓舞农民的劳动热情，提高农业生产，并且适当满足农民的文化生活的要求。根据这个方针，三年以来，广播站在向农民进行时事政治教育，宣传党和政府的政策、法令，传播文化、科学、卫生知识和动员农民迅速完成紧急任务等方面，都起了很大的作用。例如1954年9月初旬，有一天要降霜，广播站在头一天就作了紧急动员，全县四百多名干部领导群众立即展开了防霜工作，结果使全县15，000多垧晚熟作物免受灾害。1955年11月中旬，九台县委举办广播大会，通过有线广播站传达了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党的七届六中全会关于农业合作化问题的决议。参加这次广播大会的有两万多人。这次广播大会的收获很大：一、过去一千多名干部到县里开一次“三级会”，吃、宿和路费至少要花七千元。这笔钱就可以办一个有线广播站。用广播大会代替“三级会”，不但省下了这笔钱，还不耽误工作和生产。二、使各地特别是离县城比较远的地区的支部直接听了县委的传达，迅速地解决了他们在宣传中的困难。三、通过这次广播大会进一步鼓舞了广大农民的社会主义积极性。
    现在，九台有线广播站每天播音两次，中午从11点到12点50分，晚间从6点到8点25分，共4小时15分。除转播中央人民广播电台的新闻性的节目“对农村广播”、“联播节目”和吉林省人民广播电台的节目以外，自己办的节目有：“办社经验”、“农村通讯”、“思想漫谈”、农村生产情况和经验、各互助组的生产竞赛的挑战和应战条件，批评表扬、通知和指示、领导工作人员和劳动模范的报告和讲话。另外，还有为农民所欢迎的戏曲和民间优美的音乐节目。时间虽然不长，可是10多分钟到20分钟的自办节目中挤满了各种先进人物和听众的各种内容和形式的七、八个讲话、稿件和信件，切实而紧凑地传达着农村生产、生活的各个侧面，传达着农村广大群众的声音。农村有线广播站作为一个枢纽，把半径150华里以内的农民联系起来了。
    九台有线广播站获得成绩的主要原因，是领导机关重视和群众支持。1952年夏天，吉林省委就在全省党的宣传工作会议上肯定了发展农村有线广播的方针，并且开始推广九台县发展有线广播的经验。九台县委老早就做出了“一定要把喇叭引向农村，一定要让农民听到广播”的决定。广播站建成以后，县委更把有线广播站当作宣传工作的“半壁河山”，责成县委宣传部直接领导广播站的工作。在各种有关会议上，县委负责同志都经常指出广播对农村群众的教育作用。县委在布置中心工作的时候，还专门提出干部要给广播站组织稿件，协助组织收听等。此外，县委宣传部的有关会议经常吸收广播站的站长参加。
    广大农民对建设有线广播站的热情非常高涨。特别是目前，当九台县合作化运动正在蓬勃发展的时候，农村广播网的建设更得到了农民的大力支持。九台有线广播站过去的自架线路50％以上的杆子都是农民自己的，喇叭全部是农民自己购买的。三年来，全县农民在自动维护线路，修补线、杆方面更有许多动人事迹。最近九台县提出要扩建广播站，农民都表示愿意出人出钱，希望在1955年冬到1956年春把喇叭引到自己的村、社和院、舍。这充分表明了农民对建设农村广播网的积极性。
