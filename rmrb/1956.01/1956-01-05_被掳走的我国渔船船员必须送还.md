　　The Abducted Chinese Fishermen Must Be Returned
    In the statement on December 28, 1955, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded that the Syngman Rhee group immediately return the Chinese fisherman abducted in the December 25th incident, and expressed the Chinese government's willingness to return the four South Korean sailors brought back by our side who were carrying out the task of piracy in this incident. In a statement issued on December 29, the Syngman Rhee group actually denied the fact that it had abducted a Chinese crew member, thereby rejecting the fair, reasonable, and humanitarian proposal of the Chinese government to return personnel from both sides.
    Regarding the abduction of a Chinese fisherman by the Syngman Rhee group, we have conclusive evidence. The facts are there, and the Syngman Rhee group cannot deny it with empty words. News reports from Seoul also revealed this fact. The day after the incident, December 26, a Pan-Asia News Agency dispatch from Seoul said: "Well-informed sources here reported that the Nationalist Chinese Embassy has been in close contact with the South Korean government on this issue, presumably to obtain intelligence about mainland China from the captured Chinese Communist fishermen." Only on the 28th, after the statement by the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggesting that both sides return personnel was published, did the Syngman Rhee group begin to deny this matter.
    Clearly, the Syngman Rhee group's intention in attempting to deny the facts is to detain the Chinese fishermen. This inhumane act of detaining our personnel is precisely the shameful old trick that the Syngman Rhee group has been accustomed to.
    In June 1953, the Syngman Rhee group forcibly detained more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. In January 1954, the Syngman Rhee group, colluding with the US side and collaborating with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, forcibly detained more than 21,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The Syngman Rhee group and the US authorities have not yet provided a responsible account for these crimes, and the Chinese and Korean people will never forget them!
    The Syngman Rhee group's December 29 statement, while indicating its intention to detain the Chinese fishermen, also shows that it does not genuinely want its four sailors back. This clearly exposes the nature of the Syngman Rhee group's policy of detaining people: it is not only hostile to the Chinese people but also completely disregards the interests of the Korean people.
    The Syngman Rhee group also stated in the declaration that it would "take appropriate retaliatory measures". It knows full well that this kind of intimidation and clamor cannot intimidate anyone, but it does so, which can only further prove that the Syngman Rhee group's consistent policy is to create tension and fear that the world will not be in chaos. The Chinese people will resolutely defend their legitimate interests and will never allow the Syngman Rhee group to detain any Chinese people. The Chinese people fully support the December 28 statement of the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Syngman Rhee group must immediately return the Chinese fishermen it abducted to China.

### 被掳走的我国渔船船员必须送还

　　被掳走的我国渔船船员必须送还
    我国外交部发言人在1955年12月28日谈话中要求李承晚集团立即送还它在12月25日事件中掳劫去的一名我国渔船船员，并且表示我国政府准备送还在这个事件中执行劫夺任务而被我方带回的四名南朝鲜水兵。李承晚集团在12月29日发表的声明中竟然抵赖它掳走了一名我国船员的事实，借此拒绝我国政府关于双方送还对方人员的公平合理的、人道主义的建议。
    关于李承晚集团掳走一名我国渔船船员事，我们有确凿的证据。事实具在，绝不是李承晚集团所能信口抵赖的。从汉城发出的新闻报道中也透露了这一事实。事件发生的第二天，12月26日，泛亚社汉城电说：“这里的消息灵通人士报道，国民党中国的大使馆就这个问题同韩国政府进行了密切的接触，大概是为了想从被捕获的中国共产党渔民那里获得中国大陆的情报”。只是到了28日，在我国外交部发言人建议双方送还对方人员的谈话发表以后，李承晚集团才开始抵赖这件事情。
    很清楚，李承晚集团企图抵赖事实的目的就是打主意要扣留我国渔船船员。这种违反人道主义扣留我方人员的行为正是李承晚集团干惯了的可耻的老行当。
    1953年6月李承晚集团强迫扣留了27，000余名朝中战俘。1954年1月李承晚集团又伙同美方并勾结蒋介石卖国集团强迫扣留了21，000余名朝中战俘。对于这些罪行，李承晚集团和美国当局至今还没有作负责交代，中朝人民是一天也忘记不了的！
    李承晚集团12月29日的声明一面表示它企图扣留我国渔船船员，一面也说明了它并不是真正想要它的四名水兵回去。这就明显地暴露了李承晚集团的扣人政策的本质：它不仅敌视中国人民，同时也是完全不顾朝鲜人民的利益的。
    李承晚集团还在声明中说什么要“采取适当的报复措施”。它明知这种恫吓叫嚣吓不倒人，但它却这样做，这只能更加证明李承晚集团的一贯政策是制造紧张局势，唯恐天下不乱。中国人民将坚决维护自己的正当利益，决不容许李承晚集团扣留任何中国人。中国人民完全支持我国外交部发言人12月28日的谈话，李承晚集团必须立即将它掳劫去的中国渔船船员送还中国。
