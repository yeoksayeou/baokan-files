Xinhua News Agency, 6th: In Beijing's private enterprises, more than 17,400 young workers organized more than a thousand youth shock brigades on the 5th and 6th to support the work of joint state-private ownership. They proposed to do a good job in production and business in the joint state-private ownership work; to organize machinery and goods, to prepare for inventory taking, and to ensure the rapid and accurate completion of the inventory task.

Today, many youth shock brigades have begun to do voluntary labor in preparation for inventory and capital verification. Many older workers also participated in voluntary labor. More than 400 youth shock brigades in the Qianmen district held meetings on the evening of the 6th to formulate activity plans. Some teams then began to organize workshops, tools, and scrub machinery.

Youth workers from private enterprises in six districts, including Qianmen, Dongdan, and Dongsi, held youth shock brigade establishment meetings or youth shock brigade oath-taking rallies. The youth shock brigade of the private Gangdu Iron Factory, which initiated the organization of the youth shock brigades, wrote a letter to the youth workers of private enterprises throughout the city at the meeting, guaranteeing to do a good job in supporting the work of joint state-private ownership, and to complete the January production task one day in advance. The youth shock brigade members of private enterprises throughout the city quickly responded to the guarantee conditions they put forward.
