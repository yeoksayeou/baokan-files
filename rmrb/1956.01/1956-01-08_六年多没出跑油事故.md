More than Six Years Without Oil Spillage Accidents

To the Editor:

　　In October 1949, I started working as an oil delivery worker in the distillation workshop of the Fushun No. 1 Petroleum Factory. With the help of all my fellow workers in the team, I was able to operate independently after three months. At that time, I couldn't contain my inner joy! But I also realized that oil delivery work is not simple. If I am careless and open the wrong valve, oil spillage or overflow accidents could occur. We workers are the masters of the country, and we must be responsible in our work. We must not allow even a little bit of the country's wealth to be wasted in our hands!

　　Therefore, every time I deliver oil, I carefully and comprehensively check the oil delivery pipelines and closely communicate with the receiving party. As soon as I discover a place where oil might leak, I immediately rush to repair it. For example, in June 1955, I took over the shift that was delivering oil to the 150-ton No. 44 tank. Although the partner who handed over the shift said that "the situation is very normal," I still checked everywhere as usual. As a result, I found that the asbestos pad on the valve was damaged, and oil was already seeping out. If it had continued for a while, an oil spillage accident would have occurred. I immediately took action to repair it, avoiding this oil spillage accident. After making mistakes in my work, I would find ways to remedy them in a timely manner. Once, Liu Qingfeng, who was delivering oil with me, opened the wrong "Barub," and the valve head of the three-hundred-ton tank suddenly fell off. Oil ran straight into the small tank like a waterfall, and an overflow accident was about to occur. I immediately took measures to pump oil from the No. 45 tank to the No. 44 tank, which lowered the oil level in the small tank and prevented any loss. At ordinary times, if someone accidentally spilled oil, I always tried to recover it.

　　To ensure safe oil delivery, enthusiasm alone is not enough. It is also necessary to be proficient in technology and familiar with the entire equipment situation. I keep in mind which pipelines are in our workshop, how long each one is, how many large and small valves are on them, how they are distributed, and which are the key and accident-prone areas. Only in this way can I discover and solve problems in a timely manner. For example, the pipeline from the No. 44 tank to the No. 45 tank is very complicated and easily damaged when switching. I pay special attention to this area. Once, when delivering oil to the No. 44 tank, I found that the asbestos pad under the bottom of the tank was corroded and immediately notified the foreman, who replaced it with a new one in time. If you are not familiar with these key areas, it is difficult to prevent such accidents.

　　Relying on the education and training of the Party, and relying on the help and support of my comrades, I have not had a single oil spillage accident from 1949 to the present for more than six years. In 1954, I was selected as a labor model in Fushun City and received multiple awards. I think what I have done is something that other ordinary workers can do. In order to complete the great First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, I must maintain my past achievements, continue to work hard, and work with all my partners to do a better job in oil delivery.

### 六年多没出跑油事故

　　六年多没出跑油事故
　　编辑同志：
    1949年10月，我到抚顺石油一厂蒸馏车间当送油工。在全组弟兄们的帮助下，三个月以后，我就能独立操作了。当时，我抑制不住内心的喜悦！但是我也认识到：送油工作可不简单，要是粗心大意，开错一个油门，就会发生跑油事故或者冒缸事故；我们工人是国家的主人，干活要负责任，决不能让国家财富有一点一滴在我们手里被糟蹋掉！
    因此，在每次送油的时候，我总是细心地、全面地检查送油管路，密切地同接油的对方联系，一发现有可能漏油的地方就马上抢修。像1955年6月间，我接了正往150吨44号缸送油的班。虽然交班的伙伴说是“情况很正常”，但是我还是照例到处检查。结果发现活门上的石棉垫坏了，油已经在往外浸，再过一会儿就会发生跑油事故。我马上动手修理，避免了这次跑油事故。在工作中发生差错以后，我就及时想办法来挽救。有一次，同我一起送油的刘庆丰开错了“巴鲁布”，三百吨缸的活门头突然掉了，油像瀑布似的向小缸里直跑，眼看就要发生冒缸事故了。我马上采取了从45号缸往44号缸压油的措施，使小缸的油降下去了，没有遭受损失。在平时，如果有人不小心把油弄跑了，我总是想办法把油拣回来。
    要保证安全送油，光凭热情是不够的，还要精通技术，熟悉全部设备的情况。我们车间有哪些管线，每条多长，上面有多少个大小油门，分布的情况怎样，有哪些关键和容易发生事故的地方，我都牢牢地记在心里。只有这样，才可以及时发现问题，解决问题。例如，44号缸到45号缸这个地方，管线非常复杂，开关的时候容易损坏，我就特别注意这个地方。有一次，往44号缸送油的时候，我发现这个地方缸底下的石棉垫腐蚀了，立即通知工长，及时换了新的。如果不熟悉这些关键地方，就很难防止这类事故。
    依靠党的教育和培养，依靠同志们的帮助和支持，从1949年到现在六年多，我没有发生过一次跑油事故。1954年我被选为抚顺市的劳动模范，受到了多次的奖励。我想，我所做的都是别的普通工人所能做到的。为了提前完成伟大的第一个五年计划，今后我一定要保持过去的成绩，继续努力，同全体伙伴们一道，把送油工作做得更好。
