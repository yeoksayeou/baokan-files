A Commendable Initiative

The Dalian Heavy Machinery Plant recently accepted an urgent and important order: to manufacture a 140-ton plus 30-ton large bridge-type casting crane for the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Producing such a crane would normally take at least a year, based on the plant’s past production. However, in order to meet the needs of national construction, the Dalian Heavy Machinery Plant is determined to manufacture it in nine months. This machine requires the design of more than 3,000 drawings. The comrades in the design department are tapping potential in all aspects to speed up the design progress. The task that originally required four months to complete can now be finished in just two months. Similarly, after the workers thought of various methods, the preparation work for technology and tools, which used to take one and a half months, now only takes one month.

In order to comprehensively accelerate the speed of China's industrialization, what is needed now is this initiative spirit that is not limited by conventions and not hindered by difficulties!

    可贵的主动精神
    大连起重机器厂最近接受了一项紧急而又重要的订货——给鞍山钢铁公司制造一台140吨加30吨的大型桥式铸造起重机。生产这样的起重机，按照这个厂过去的生产情况，最快要一年。但是，大连起重机器厂为了适应国家建设要求，保证用九个月的时间制造出来。这台机器需要设计三千多张图纸，设计科的同志们从各方面挖掘潜力，加快设计进度，原来需要四个月才能完成的任务，现在只用两个月就可以完成了。同样，经过职工多方面想办法，过去需要一个半月的工艺和工具等准备工作，现在一个月就够了。
    为了全面地加快我国工业化的速度，现在需要的就是这种不受常规所限、不为困难所阻的主动精神！
