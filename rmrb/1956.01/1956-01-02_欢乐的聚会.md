　　A Joyful Gathering
    Our Correspondent

    The first day of 1956.

    Over 17,000 children in the capital spent this happy and blissful day together for the first time.

    From early in the morning, children surged toward the Soviet Exhibition Center like a tide. Among them were the sons and daughters of workers, the offspring of farmers, the children of government officials, children of various ethnic groups in bright national costumes, and international children from all over the world. Some art, science education, and literary workers from the capital also rushed to celebrate the New Year with the children. The exhibition hall was hung with red and green lights. In the central hall and the center of the industrial hall, two tall New Year fir trees stood, adorned with various animals, candies, and building toys. Under the trees hung many "Three Good" lanterns. Among the branches of the New Year fir trees, many small light bulbs sparkled, like a tree full of blooming silver flowers. The children were like entering a fairy palace in a fairy tale. They looked in amazement, they surrounded the flower trees, talking, laughing, and admiring them again and again.

    After a burst of lively New Year gongs and drums, a little girl of twelve or thirteen appeared in front of the podium and announced the start of the party. The choir then sang a New Year song - we are one year older. The same little girl walked to the front of the stage again and recited a New Year poem with a silver bell-like voice: "...In 1955, we did not waste our time: our bodies grew stronger, our studies progressed, and for the motherland, we also formulated a small five-year plan, and each of us is determined to complete it. ...1956 has arrived, 1956, the motherland is speeding towards socialism. Come, dear little friends, let us welcome the birth of 1956 together."

    Snowflakes and streamers suddenly floated in the sky. Accompanied by music, Father New Year with a silver-white beard fluttering on his chest and the Spring Maiden smiling like a flower, entered the venue surrounded by various animals and athletes. The audience immediately erupted in thunderous applause and cheers. Father New Year stood on the podium, looking around in astonishment, and asked the Spring Maiden: "Child, where have we arrived?" The Spring Maiden told him: "We have arrived in Beijing, our capital!" After Father New Year congratulated the children on the New Year, he declared: "We are late. We visited agricultural cooperatives in Heilongjiang, visited the First Automobile Works in Jilin, and participated in a Young Pioneer's small five-year plan at a school in Liaoning... Along the way, everyone said that we are now on the road to socialism." He then said to the Spring Maiden: "What did you bring for everyone!" The Spring Maiden said: "I will bring the east wind to the branches, so that the birds can fly happily in the blue sky; I will bring the drizzle to the fields, so that the seeds can smell the fragrance of the soil;... I will bring them the best gift, which is to help them formulate a small five-year plan." The Spring Maiden then said to the children: "Today, I am here to help you formulate a small five-year plan. On this day next year, I will also come to see your achievements in implementing the small five-year plan." Amid applause, Father New Year and the Spring Maiden led the little deer, little rabbits, little bears, and others into the children's group and danced a group dance together.

    In the Palace of Knowledge, the Puppet Theater on both sides of the industrial hall, and the Game Palace upstairs, various vivid, interesting, lively, and joyful activities also began. In the Game Palace, there were games such as pinning the nose, shooting air guns, tortoise racing, and fishing. The pinning the nose area was the most lively. A picture of a child's face was pasted on the wall. The children used blindfolds to cover their eyes and held a paper nose, feeling their way to pin it on the picture. Some people pinned it right on the nose, and everyone clapped and cheered. Some people pinned the nose on the eyes, eyebrows, or on the lips, chin, or even on the ears and the top of the head, which looked very funny, causing a burst of laughter. In the Puppet Theater and other performances, in addition to the China Acrobatic Troupe and the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe performing for the children, many were children performing for children. The children were fascinated by the wonderful programs and watched without moving.

    The various activities in the Palace of Knowledge were even more in line with the children's psychology and requirements. In the riddle-guessing area, children were studying and arguing in groups of twos and threes, like a learning discussion. There was a place playing with "casual slides." The children drew various pictures on the glass with brushes, then put it in front of the slide projector, moving the slides and magnifying glass back and forth to find the focal point. The children were also very interested in this. In addition, there were also chemical magic, physical and chemical games, parachute jumping competitions, electric ball and other activities, which also attracted a large number of children.

    Just as everyone was enjoying themselves and singing to their hearts' content, gongs and drums were played again in the hall, firecrackers were set off, and four large lions led eight small lions to perform. They teased the children while performing. All kinds of animals also made a full appearance, leading everyone to dance the Yangko, and the entire venue was once again swept into a boiling carnival.

    The children knew that their happy life was brought to them by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. A New Year's letter to Chairman Mao was read at the meeting, and the children cheered "Long live Chairman Mao!"

　　欢乐的聚会
    本报记者
    1956年的头一天。
    首都17，000多个儿童头一次在一块渡过了这愉快幸福的一天。
    从一清早起，孩子们就像潮水一样涌向苏联展览馆。这里面有工人的儿女，有农民的子弟，有机关干部的孩子，有穿着鲜艳民族服装的各族儿童，也有来自世界各地的国际小朋友。首都的一些艺术、科学教育工作者、文艺工作者，也赶来和孩子们一起过新年。展览馆里挂满了红红绿绿的电灯。在中央大厅和工业馆的中央，耸立着两株高大的新年枞树，树上饰着各色各样的动物、糖果和建筑物等玩具，树下边悬挂着很多“三好”花灯，在新年枞树的枝叶间，很多小灯泡闪闪发光，如同开放着的满树银花。儿童们像走进童话里的仙宫一样，他们惊奇地瞧着，他们围绕着花树，说着、笑着，一次又一次地欣赏着。
    在一阵热闹的新年锣鼓声以后，一个十二、三岁的小姑娘出现在主席台前，宣布联欢会开始。合唱队接着唱起了新年歌——我们又长大了一岁。还是那个小姑娘，又走到台前用银铃似的声音朗诵着新年诗：“……1955年，我们没有白白放过：我们身体长棒啦，学习进步啦，为了祖国，我们还制定了小五年计划，我们每个人都决心完成它。……1956年啦，1956年，祖国朝着社会主义飞奔。来吧，亲爱的小伙伴，让我们一同来迎接1956年的诞生。”
    天空中忽然飘起雪花和彩条，在音乐声中，胸前飘拂着银白色胡须的新年老人和笑得像花朵一样的春姑娘，在各种动物和运动员簇拥下进入了会场。全场立即响起暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声。新年老人站在主席台上惊愕地望望四周，问春姑娘说：“孩子，这是到了哪儿啦？”春姑娘告诉他说：“到了北京，到了我们的首都啦！”新年老人向孩子祝贺新年后声明说：“我们来晚了，我们在黑龙江参观了农业合作社，在吉林访问了第一汽车厂，在辽宁又参加了一个学校的少先队订小五年计划……一路上到处都说这下走上社会主义大道啦。”他又向春姑娘说：“你带了些什么给大家呀！”春姑娘说：“我会把东风带给树枝，让小鸟在蓝天上快乐地飞；我会把细雨带给田地，让种籽闻到泥土的香味；……我带给他们最好的礼物，就是帮助他们订小五年计划。”春姑娘接着又向儿童们说：“今天，我来帮你们订小五年计划，明年的今天，我还要来看看你们搞小五年计划的成绩。”在鼓掌声中，新年老人和春姑娘带领着小鹿、小兔、小熊等走进儿童群中，一起跳起集体舞来了。
    在工业馆两旁的知识宫、木偶剧场和楼上的游戏宫里，这时也开始了生动、有趣、活泼、愉快的各种活动。游戏宫里有挂鼻子、打气枪、乌龟赛跑、钓鱼等游戏项目，挂鼻子的地方最热闹，墙上贴一张儿童脸部画像，儿童们用脸罩把眼遮住，提一个纸做的鼻子摸着朝像上挂，有的人一挂就挂在鼻子的部位上，大家便拍手叫好，也有些人把鼻子挂在眼上、眉毛上，或者挂在唇上、下巴上，甚至有的还挂在耳朵上、头顶上，看起来很好笑，于是引起一阵哄堂大笑。在木偶剧场和其他演出节目里，除中国杂技团、新疆歌舞团向儿童演出外，很多都是儿童演给儿童看的，孩子们被那些精彩的节目迷住了，一动也不动地瞧着。
    知识宫里的各项活动，更符合儿童的心理和要求。猜灯谜的地方，儿童们三三两两地在研究着、争论着，如同学习讨论会一样。有一处玩着“随便幻灯”，孩子们用画笔在玻璃上画着各种图画，再把它放到幻灯前面，来回移动着画片和放大镜，寻找焦点，这个孩子们也很感兴趣。此外，还有化学魔术、理化游戏、跳伞比赛、电球等活动，也都吸引着大批的儿童。
    正当大家尽情地欢乐，尽情地歌唱的时候，大厅中又打起了锣鼓，放起了鞭炮，四只大狮子带着八只小狮子出场表演了，它们一面表演一面逗着孩子们玩。各种动物也都全部出场，带动大家扭秧歌，整个会场又都卷入沸腾的狂欢中了。
    孩子们知道幸福生活是共产党和毛主席带给他们的，会上宣读了给毛主席的贺年信，孩子们欢呼毛主席万岁！
