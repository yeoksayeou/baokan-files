Everyone Should Learn and Apply Advanced Experience

　　Currently, the central industrial and transportation departments are actively and deeply studying the basic measures for completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule; all departments have determined that promoting advanced experience is the most important method for completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

　　In recent years, whether in production or capital construction, heavy industry or light industry, any industry or any type of work, whether in management or technology, many effective and universally significant advanced experiences have emerged in our country. These advanced experiences are the result of the creative labor of millions of workers, technicians, and management personnel under the leadership of the Party, the result of the enthusiastic assistance of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries to our construction cause, and the result of the diligent learning of our vast number of employees from them. Countless facts prove that wherever advanced experience is applied, the work there takes a leap forward. The open-hearth furnaces of the steel plants under the Steel Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry saw an estimated production increase of 34.7% in 1955 compared to the actual production in 1954. The main reason was the promotion of three advanced experiences: thick-layer sintering furnace bottom repair, rapid cold repair, and rapid steelmaking. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's iron smelting plant produced 115,000 tons more high-quality iron for the country in 1955, mainly because of the promotion of advanced experiences such as steam blast. The builders of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway learned from the Soviet experience of large-scale earthwork blasting, which sped up the construction; one blast excavated the equivalent of 40,000 people working for a day. These many experiences have improved our country's industrial technology and management level, becoming the most vital factor in accelerating our country's industrialization.

　　The current task is to promote advanced experience to every enterprise and for every employee to master it; to make advanced experience not only play a role in one enterprise or one unit, but also become a force to promote the progress of all departments and all enterprises. According to the calculations of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, as long as the three advanced experiences of self-fluxing sintered ore, steam blast, and high-pressure furnace top are promoted in all iron smelting plants across the country in the future, more than one million tons of pig iron can be produced annually; if the three advanced experiences of rapid steelmaking, oxygen steelmaking, and new furnace methods are promoted in all steel plants across the country, more than one million tons of steel can be produced annually. This means that the state does not need to pay for capital construction investment, and can obtain a large amount of iron and steel simply by relying on existing equipment. This fully demonstrates the great significance of promoting advanced experience in accelerating China's industrial development. The first pair of modern vertical shafts built in our country—the Hegang Dongshan Vertical Shaft—took 58 months of construction time, two months ahead of the usual time; according to the calculation of the Ministry of Coal Industry, promoting several aspects of advanced experience that have been summarized in future shaft construction projects can shorten the construction period of vertical shafts of the same scale by 12 months. The Xieji No. 2 well of the Huainan Mining Bureau, which is currently under construction, is expected to be completed in only thirty-odd months. This shows that promoting advanced experience can also play a huge role in accelerating the speed of capital construction.

　　In many industries and other departments, many advanced experiences have been promoted and achieved great success. However, there are still some departments and enterprises that have not deeply realized the significance of promoting advanced experience, and do not fully understand the relationship between promoting advanced experience and accelerating the speed of industrialization. Some have relaxed the work of summarizing and promoting advanced experience, causing some advanced experiences to be short-lived and buried. Some, although they have promoted some advanced experiences, do so very infrequently and intermittently; they usually only grasp advanced experience when the task is tight, when carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, or when organizing competitions to welcome festivals, which makes it impossible to consolidate some advanced experiences. Others only promote one or two advanced operating experiences in isolation, but do not pay attention to promoting advanced management experience, or only promote advanced experience in one process, but do not pay attention to promoting advanced experience in other processes related to it, so that advanced experience is dragged down by the backward environment and cannot play its due role. This "lazy" phenomenon greatly hinders the exertion of potential forces in our enterprises.

　　In order to greatly improve the work of promoting advanced experience, this requires planned, comprehensive, systematic, and regular promotion of advanced experience. All departments and enterprises must immediately strengthen the leadership of the work of promoting advanced experience, and make comprehensive plans for the work of learning and promoting advanced experience based on the enterprise's development plan, especially the technical development plan. It is necessary to sort out and summarize the existing advanced experience, formulate plans and specific requirements for promoting advanced experience, establish and improve the organization and responsibility system for promoting advanced experience, and propose specific measures for promoting advanced experience. In the planning, it is necessary to focus on promoting effective and key advanced experience, resolutely implement the policy of learning from the Soviet Union, conscientiously implement expert suggestions, and further learn from the new advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries. Attention should be paid to using successful methods of promoting advanced experience, such as holding professional conferences to summarize and exchange advanced experience, organizing technical performances and competitions of the same type of work, and running training classes for advanced experience. Individuals and collectives who create and actively learn from advanced experience should be rewarded in a timely manner. Party organizations at all levels, especially Party organizations in enterprises, must actively lead the planning work of learning and promoting advanced experience, oppose all kinds of conservatism, and ensure that the planning for learning and promoting advanced experience can adapt to the Party's requirements for accelerating the speed of industrialization and can meet the requirements of millions of workers to quickly master new technologies. With such planning and conscientious implementation, a mass upsurge of learning and promoting advanced experience can be formed throughout the country.

　　It can be fully expected that when the mass upsurge of learning and promoting advanced experience arrives, thousands upon thousands of advanced producers will emerge in our country, and the new records they create will break through the existing production level and throw the original quotas and indicators far behind, and the "equilibrium" of enterprise production will be broken by this wave. We should not be afraid of this "imbalance." Because things are inherently developed in a state of imbalance. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Contradiction": "There is nothing in the world that develops in absolute balance, and we must oppose the theory of balance, or the theory of equilibrium." When the original balance in the enterprise is broken through by advanced experience, the leaders of the Party organization and the leaders of the enterprise administration should actively take measures to make the backward parts catch up with the advanced parts, so that our enterprises can continue to move forward and production can continue to develop. Some people are accustomed to ease and are willing to maintain a certain level of the enterprise for a long time, fearing that advanced experience will disrupt the peaceful life in the enterprise. Such people are bound by conservative thinking, dragging the enterprise from moving forward. In the cause of building socialism, Party organizations must promptly fight against this conservative thinking, and clear the way for the growth and development of new things and the promotion of advanced experience!

　　Completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and accelerating the speed of socialist industrialization is our goal. Learning and promoting advanced experience is one of the most effective methods for us to strive to achieve this goal.

### 人人都要学习和运用先进经验

　　人人都要学习和运用先进经验
    现在，中央各个工业和交通运输部门正在积极深入地研究提前完成第一个五年计划的基本措施；各个部门都确定了要以推广先进经验作为提前完成五年计划的最重要的方法。
    我国近几年来无论是生产或基本建设、重工业或轻工业，无论是那一个行业或那一个工种，也无论是管理方面或技术方面，都出现了许多具有普遍意义的行之有效的先进经验。这些先进经验，是我国千百万工人和技术人员、管理人员在党的领导下，进行创造性劳动的结果，是苏联和其他兄弟国家对我国建设事业热忱帮助和我国广大职工认真地向他们学习的结果。无数的事实证明，那个地方运用了先进经验，那个地方的工作就跃进一步。重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属各炼钢厂的平炉，1955年的预计产量比1954年的实际产量增长了34.7％。主要原因就是推广了厚层烧补炉底、快速冷修、快速炼钢三项先进经验。鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂1955年为国家多生产了11.5万吨优质铁，主要原因就是推广了蒸汽鼓风等先进经验。修建鹰厦铁路的建设者，学习苏联土方大爆破的经验，加快了建设速度，一次爆破炸掉的土方就等于四万人一天的工作量。这许多经验提高了我国工业的技术和管理水平，成为加快我国工业化速度的最有生命力的因素。
      当前的任务就是把先进经验推广到每一个企业，为每一个职工所掌握；使先进经验不仅仅在一个企业、一个单位当中发生作用，而成为推动所有部门、所有企业前进的力量。根据重工业部的计算，今后只要在全国所有的炼铁厂推广自熔性烧结矿、蒸汽鼓风、高压炉顶这三项先进经验，每年就可以多生产一百多万吨生铁；如果在全国所有的炼钢厂推广快速炼钢、氧气炼钢、新炼炉法三项先进经验，每年就可以多生产一百多万吨钢。这就是说，国家不支付基本建设投资，仅仅依靠现有的设备，就可以获得大量的钢铁。这充分说明了推广先进经验对加速我国工业发展的巨大意义。我国新建的第一对现代化竖井——鹤岗东山竖井，用了58个月的建设时间，较通常情况提前了两个月；据煤炭工业部计算，今后在建井工程中推广已经总结出来的几个方面的先进经验，可以做到使同样规模的竖井的建设期间缩短12个月。现在正在建设中的淮南矿务局谢家集二号井，预计只要三十几个月就能完成。这说明，推广先进经验，对加快基本建设速度同样能起巨大的作用。
    在许多工业及其它部门中，很多先进经验已经推广了，有很大成就。但是，也还有一些部门和企业还没有深刻地认识到推广先进经验的意义，还不完全了解推广先进经验和加快工业化速度的关系。有的放松了对先进经验的总结和推广工作，使有些先进经验昙花一现，就被埋没了。有的虽然推广了一些先进经验，却很不经常，时断时续，通常是任务紧的时候、开展增产节约运动的时候、或者是为迎接节日组织竞赛的时候，才去抓先进经验，这就使得有些先进经验不能够巩固下来。还有的只是孤立地推广一两种先进的操作经验，却不注意推广管理方面的先进经验，或者只在某一个工序中推广先进经验，却不注意在同它相联系的其他工序中推广先进经验，以致使先进经验被落后的环境拖住了，不能发挥应有的作用。这种“懒洋洋”的现象，大大地妨碍了我们企业中的潜在力量的发挥。
      为了把推广先进经验的工作大大提高一步，这就要求有计划地、全面地、系统地、经常地推广先进经验。各个部门、各个企业，要立即加强领导推广先进经验的工作，要根据企业的发展计划，特别是技术发展计划，对学习和推广先进经验的工作作出全面的规划。要整理和总结已有的先进经验，拟定推广先进经验的计划和具体要求，建立和健全推广先进经验的机构和责任制度，提出推广先进经验的具体措施。在规划当中，要着重推广行之有效的关键性的先进经验，要坚决贯彻学习苏联的方针，认真执行专家建议，并且进一步学习苏联的和其他国家的新的先进经验。要注意运用成功的推广先进经验的方法，如召开总结和交流先进经验的专业会议，组织同工种的技术表演和竞赛，开办先进经验训练班等等。要及时奖励创造和积极学习先进经验的个人和集体。各级党的组织，特别是企业中党的组织，要积极领导学习和推广先进经验的规划工作，反对各种各样的保守主义，一定要使学习和推广先进经验的规划能够适应党对加快工业化速度的要求，能够满足千百万工人迅速掌握新技术的要求。有了这样的规划，并且认真执行，就能够在全国范围内形成一个群众性的学习和推广先进经验的热潮。
      完全可以预期，当学习和推广先进经验的群众性的热潮到来的时候，在我们的国家里，一定会涌现出成千成万的先进生产者，他们所创造的新纪录，一定会突破现有的生产水平，把原来的定额和指标远远地抛在后面，企业生产的“平衡”将被这个浪潮击破。我们不要害怕这种“不平衡”。因为事物本来是在不平衡的状态中发展的。毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中说：“世界上没有绝对地平衡发展的东西，我们必须反对平衡论，或均衡论。”当企业中的原有的平衡被先进经验突破的时候，党组织的领导者和企业行政的领导者就应该积极采取措施，使落后的部分赶上先进的部分，这样我们的企业才能不断地前进，生产才能不断地发展。有些人惯于安逸，愿意企业长期保持一定的水平，害怕先进经验扰乱企业中的平静生活。这种人被保守思想所束缚，拖着企业不能前进。在建设社会主义事业当中，党的组织必须及时地向这种保守思想进行斗争，给新鲜事物的生长和发展、给先进经验的推广扫清道路！
    提早完成五年计划，加快社会主义工业化的速度，这是我们的目的。学习和推广先进经验，就是我们争取达到这个目的的一个最有效的方法。
