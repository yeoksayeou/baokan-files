Tear Off the Mask of the Bogus Scholar
Ruò Shuǐ

The article "Critique of Hua Gang's 'Outline of Dialectical Materialism'" in the "People's Daily" on December 24th last year exposed Hua Gang's plagiarism. This event has already caused surprise and indignation among a large number of readers. But we must further point out that Hua Gang's plagiarism is by no means limited to the book "Outline of Dialectical Materialism." Based on the materials we have at hand, it can already be determined that Hua Gang's plagiarism is not accidental, but consistent; not piecemeal, but massive.

Hua Gang's several large and small "works," such as "History of the Chinese National Liberation Movement," "History of the May Fourth Movement," "History of Soviet Diplomacy," "Reversal of Chinese History," "History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolutionary War," "The Logical Development of Lu Xun's Thought," and "Dialectical Materialism and Physics," all bear traces of plagiarism. Among these books, "History of the Chinese National Liberation Movement" is Hua Gang's most famous major "work." We might as well take this book as an example first. This book was first published in Chongqing in 1940 in two volumes. A "revised edition" of the first volume was published in Beijing in 1950. In this "revised edition," this situation can be found in almost every chapter: without any statement, certain parts of other people's works, from ideological content to textual structure, including the original quotations, are copied down in whole paragraphs and sections. The books plagiarized are the following: Jian Bozan's "An Outline of Chinese History," Li Dingsheng's "Modern Chinese History," Fan Wenlan's "Modern Chinese History," Li Shu's "The 1911 Revolution and Yuan Shikai," and Hu Sheng's "Imperialism and Chinese Politics," etc.

Examples of plagiarism:

Chapter 1, "Introduction," from page 37 to page 41, discusses the section on the Mongoloid race, approximately 2,500 words, all copied from Jian's "An Outline of Chinese History," Volume 1, Chapter 1, Section 3, only changing Jian's term "late stage of the barbaric era" to "early stage of the barbaric era," and making a few deletions. The following section from page 41 to page 43, discussing the South Pacific race, approximately 1,500 words, is also entirely copied from Jian's "An Outline of Chinese History," Chapter 1, Section 4.

Chapter 2, "The Beginning of Modern Chinese History – The Opium War," from page 78 to page 96, more than 4,000 words are copied from Li's and Fan's "Modern Chinese History."

In Chapter 5, "The Sino-French War and the Sino-Japanese War," about 2,000 words on the Ryukyu Incident and the Yantai Treaty are also copied from Fan's "Modern Chinese History."

In Chapter 6, "The Hundred Days' Reform and the Boxer Movement," almost the entire first section, "The Process of the Imperialist Powers Dividing Spheres of Influence in China," is plagiarized. From page 360 to page 364, approximately 2,600 words are copied from Fan's "Modern Chinese History," from page 364 to page 371, approximately 4,000 words are copied from Li's "Modern Chinese History," and from page 372 to page 375, the end of this section, approximately 2,000 words are copied from Hu Sheng's "Imperialism and Chinese Politics." In total, the entire section is no more than 10,000 words, and the parts copied in whole paragraphs reach more than 9,000 words. In the second section, "The Emergence and Development of the Reform Movement," approximately 3,000 words from page 380 to page 386 are copied from Fan's "Modern Chinese History." In the third section, "The Course and Evaluation of the Hundred Days' Reform," approximately 3,300 words from page 394 to page 398 are copied from Fan's "Modern Chinese History." In the fourth section, "The Causes and Characteristics of the Boxer Movement," approximately 1,500 words are copied from Fan's and Hu's "Modern Chinese History." In the fifth section, "The Course and Content of the Boxer Uprising," approximately 4,000 words from page 417 to page 423 are copied from Fan's "Modern Chinese History," and another section of approximately 300 words is copied from Hu's "Modern Chinese History." In the sixth section, "The Eight-Power Allied Forces' Invasion and the Conflicts Among the Powers," approximately 1,500 words are copied from Fan's and Hu's "Modern Chinese History."

Chapter 7, "The 1911 Revolution," from page 483 to page 531, a full 17,000 words are entirely copied from Li's "The 1911 Revolution and Yuan Shikai."

As for Hua Gang's other "works," there is also serious plagiarism. For example, many parts of "The Logical Development of Lu Xun's Thought" are copied from Ping Xin's "People's Literary Giant Lu Xun," "History of the May Fourth Movement" plagiarized Chen Boda's "Yuan Shikai, the National Thief" and Hu Sheng's "Imperialism and Chinese Politics," "Reversal of Chinese History" plagiarized Jian Bozan's "Textbook of Historical Philosophy" and other books, "History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolutionary War" plagiarized Luo Ergang's works, Guo Tingyi's "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom History Diary" and Jian Youwen's "History of the Taiping Army's First Uprising in Guangxi," etc.

What is particularly infuriating is that Hua Gang also often plagiarizes the works of revolutionary leaders, quietly attributing some classic sentences of Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong to his own name. For example, in "History of Soviet Diplomacy," Hua Gang copied several paragraphs from Stalin's "Report on the Draft of the Soviet Constitution" word for word, sandwiching them in his own context. In "Reversal of Chinese History," he also copied Stalin's "Dialectical and Historical Materialism" and Comrade Mao Zedong's "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" in whole paragraphs. These were originally quotations, but not only were there no quotation marks, but there were not even words like "Stalin pointed out" or "Comrade Mao Zedong believed," as if these were all Hua Gang's own arguments and expressions!

To fully investigate Hua Gang's plagiarism will be no easy task. We have not had time to conduct many checks, but the above materials are enough to illustrate that Hua Gang is not a "theorist" at all, but a deceitful and fame-stealing cultural swindler.

Such an unlearned, bogus "scholar" who started his career by plagiarism, still shamelessly talked about his "spirit of hard study" and "creative labor attitude" in the small booklet "The Main Key to Cultivating Independent Thinking Ability," advising young students not to "copy other people's ready-made answers or ask others to do it for them" when doing homework!

Referring to other people's works when writing a book is not only permissible but also necessary. However, without making any statement or considering it a citation (Hua Gang also made statements in some unimportant places, but this was only to cover up his large-scale surreptitious plagiarism), to move other people's works wholesale, including ideas and words, piecing them together, cutting and pasting, and then signing "by so-and-so," and publishing it openly, is a shameful act of plagiarism.

The bad style of bogus scholars like Hua Gang has had some influence in China's academic circles. We must thoroughly eliminate this influence so that all those who honestly engage in academic work will not be contaminated by this bad style. Academic work cannot tolerate any falsehood. Without diligent independent research, no one can make any contribution. Even popular general reading materials should have their own labor and their own language in narration and explanation. Laziness cannot do a good job. Stealing other people's labor achievements is the behavior of the exploiting classes. Taking advantage and skillfully plagiarizing are styles that should be despised. Not passing off other people's things as one's own is the basic morality of an academic worker.

In this regard, Marx has set the best example for us. Lafargue, in his "Reminiscences of Marx," recounted: "'Capital' contains so many citations from unnamed writers that people might think this is to show off erudition. But Marx was motivated by a completely different motive. He said: 'I am executing historical justice, to give everyone the credit they deserve.' He felt it was his duty to point out the names of the writers who first published an idea or elaborated on it more accurately than anyone else, no matter how unimportant and unknown the writer was."

Marx was also dissatisfied with others plagiarizing his work. In a footnote to the preface of the first edition of "Capital," he made the following statement: "Incidentally, it should be said that the general theoretical propositions in Lassalle's economic works, such as the historicity of capital, the connection between production relations and modes of production, etc., are almost word-for-word plagiarized from my works, even including the terms I created, without any statement. He did this simply to promote himself. Of course, I am not talking about his interpretations and applications, which have nothing to do with me."

Everyone knows that Engels' book "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State" utilized Morgan's research results on ancient society. Engels' book is an original classic work of modern socialism. It is not a retelling of Morgan's work, but uses the viewpoint of historical materialism to explain Morgan's research results and scientifically demonstrate these results. Morgan's works were met with "enthusiastic plagiarism and stubborn obliteration" in England. English scholars studying primitive history plagiarized the great discoveries of the American Morgan, but none of them were willing to publicly acknowledge Morgan's contribution. In his book, Engels gave a high evaluation of Morgan's discoveries and stated which materials originally belonged to Morgan and which were supplemented by himself. In the preface to the fourth edition, Engels also gave a brief review of the development of views on family history from Bachofen to Morgan. Engels said: "I want to do this mainly because the chauvinistic school of English primitive history still obliterates as much as possible the revolution that Morgan's discoveries have brought about in primitive historical views, but this school does not hesitate to plunder the results of Morgan's research as its own. In other countries, it is also common to imitate this example of England with great enthusiasm."

We can also look at Lenin. In his book "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," Lenin used the works of the British social liberal scholar Hobson and the Austrian economist Hilferding. Lenin not only noted them in the places where he cited them, but also pointed out that their works, although having erroneous views, also had their value.

We must take the writing attitude of Marxist classic writers as an example, establish an honest and diligent atmosphere in academic circles, and eliminate those incorrigible bogus scholars from the ranks of academia, no matter how high their false fame and status!

    撕下冒牌学者的假面具
    若水
    去年12月24日“人民日报”上“评华岗的‘辩证唯物论大纲’”一文，揭发了华岗的抄袭行为。这件事已经引起了广大读者的惊讶和愤慨。但我们还必须进一步指出，华岗的抄袭决不限于“辩证唯物论大纲”这一本书。根据我们手头现有的材料，已经可以判定：华岗的抄袭不是偶然的，而是一贯的；不是零碎的，而是大量的。
    华岗的几本大大小小的“著作”，如“中国民族解放运动史”“五四运动史”“苏联外交史”“中国历史的翻案”“太平天国革命战争史”“鲁迅思想的逻辑发展”“辩证唯物论和物理学”等，都有抄袭的痕迹。在这些书里面，“中国民族解放运动史”是华岗的最出名的大“著作”，我们不妨先举这部书为例。这部书1940年在重庆初版，共两卷，1950年在北京出版了第一卷的“增订本”。在这个“增订本”中，几乎每一章都可以发现这种情况：不作任何声明，把别人的著作的某些部分，从思想内容到文字结构，连带原有的引文，整段整节地抄录下来。所抄袭的书是下面几本：翦伯赞的“中国史纲”，李鼎声的“中国近代史”，范文澜的“中国近代史”，黎澍的“辛亥革命与袁世凯”，胡绳的“帝国主义与中国政治”等。
    抄袭情况举例：
    第一章“绪论”，由37页到41页论述蒙古高原系人种一段约2，500字，全抄自翦著第一卷第一章第三节，只是把翦著“蒙昧时代下期”一词改成“蒙昧时代初期”，并作了少许删节。以下41页到43页论述南太平洋系人种一段约1，500字，也全部抄自翦著第一章第四节。
    第二章“中国近代史的开端——鸦片战争”，由78页到96页，有4，000多字分别抄自李著和范著“中国近代史”。
    第五章“中法战争与甲午战争”中关于琉球事件和烟台条约两段约2，000多字，也是抄自范著。
    第六章“戊戌政变与义和团运动”其中第一节“帝国主义列强在中国划分势力范围的经过”几乎全是抄袭。由360页到364页约2，600多字抄范著，由364页到371页约4，000多字抄李著，由372页到375页本节完约2，000多字抄胡著“帝国主义与中国政治”。合计起来，本节全文不过一万字，而整段抄袭的部分达9，000多字。第二节“维新变法运动的产生和发展”380页到386页约3，000多字抄范著，第三节“戊戌政变的经过及其评价”394页到398页约3，300多字抄范著，第四节“义和团运动的起因和特质”约1，500余字抄范著和胡著，第五节“义和团起事的经过和内容”由417页到423页约4，000多字抄范著，另有一段约300字抄胡著，第六节“八国联军之役与列强的冲突”约1，500多字抄范著和胡著。
    第七章“1911年的辛亥革命”，由483到531页，整整有17，000字全部抄自黎著“辛亥革命与袁世凯”。
    至于华岗的其他“著作”，也都有严重的剽窃。像“鲁迅思想的逻辑发展”有许多部分是抄自平心的“人民文豪鲁迅”，“五四运动史”抄袭了陈伯达的“窃国大盗袁世凯”和胡绳的“帝国主义与中国政治”，“中国历史的翻案”抄袭了翦伯赞的“历史哲学教程”和其他书籍，“太平天国革命战争史”抄袭了罗尔纲的著作，郭廷以的“太平天国史事日志”和简又文的“太平军广西首义史”，等等。
    特别令人愤慨的是华岗还常常剽窃革命领袖的著作，把斯大林和毛泽东同志的一些经典式的文句不声不响地归在他自己的名下。例如，在“苏联外交史”中，华岗把斯大林的“论苏联宪法草案的报告”中的好几段逐字逐句抄下来，夹在自己的前后文中，在“中国历史的翻案”里，也整段整段地照抄斯大林的“辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义”和毛泽东同志的“中国革命和中国共产党”。这本来都是引文，但不但没有引号，连“斯大林指出”“毛泽东同志认为”这样的字样都没有，好像这都是华岗他本人的论断和表述！
    要全部查清华岗的抄袭行为，这会是一件不轻的工作。我们还没有来得及进行很多的查对工作，但上述的材料已经足够说明：华岗完全不是什么“理论家”，而是一个欺世盗名的文化骗子。
    这样一个靠抄袭起家的不学无术的冒牌“学者”，居然还厚着脸皮在“培养独立思考能力的主要关键”那本小册子里大谈其“刻苦钻研的精神”和“创造性的劳动态度”，劝青年学生做习题作业时“决不要抄袭别人的现成答案或请别人代做”！
    写书时参考别人的著作，不但是可以的，而且是必要的。但是，既不加声明，又不算引证（华岗在某些无关重要的地方也作了声明，但这只是为了掩饰他的大部分的偷偷摸摸的抄袭。），就把别人的著作连思想带文字一并搬过来，东拼西凑，剪剪贴贴，就署明“某某著”，堂而皇之地拿去出版，那就是可耻的剽窃行为了。
    像华岗这样的冒牌学者的恶劣作风，在我国学术界中是曾起了一些影响的。我们必须彻底肃清这种影响，使一切诚实地从事学术工作的人不至沾染到这种恶劣作风。学术工作是来不得半点虚假的，没有刻苦的独立研究，任何人也不可能有所贡献。就是普及性的一般读物，在叙述解释上也应该有自己的劳动，自己的语言，偷懒是做不好工作的。窃夺别人的劳动成果，这是剥削阶级的行为。占便宜，取巧剽窃，这一类作风，是应该受到鄙弃的。不把别人的东西冒充为自己的东西，这是一个学术工作者的起码道德。
    在这方面，马克思给我们树立了最好的榜样。拉伐格在他的“回忆马克思”一文中记述说：“‘资本论’里面包含了那么多无名作家的引证，人们也许会以为这是要炫示学识渊博。但马克思却是出于一种完全不同的动机。他说：‘我执行历史的裁判，要把每个人应得的功劳给他。’他觉得指出首先发表一种思想或把这种思想阐述得比任何别人都更为精确的作家的名字，不管这个作家是多么不重要和多么无名，这是他的责任。”
    马克思也不满意别人剽窃他的东西。在“资本论”初版序的附注，他曾经作了这样一个声明：“附带要说到，拉萨尔经济著作中的一般的理论命题，例如关于资本的历史性，关于生产关系与生产方式间的联系等等，几乎逐字剽窃自我的著作，甚至连我所创造的名词在内，而未加任何声明。他这样做，无非想鼓吹一下。当然，我这里说的，不是他的解释和应用，这些是与我没有关系的。”
    大家知道恩格斯的“家庭、私有制和国家的起源”那本书，是利用了摩尔根关于古代社会研究的成果的。恩格斯这本书是一部有独创性的现代社会主义的经典著作，它不是摩尔根的复述，而是用唯物史观的观点去阐明摩尔根的研究成果，对这种成果加以科学的论证。摩尔根的著作在英国遭到了“热心地抄袭及顽强地抹煞”。英国的研究原始历史的学者剽窃了美国摩尔根的伟大发现，但是他们之中没有一个人肯公开承认摩尔根的功绩。恩格斯在他这本著作里给摩尔根的发现作了很高的评价，并且声明了哪些材料是原属摩尔根的，哪些是他自己所补充的。在第四版的序言里，恩格斯还把从巴苛芬到摩尔根对于家庭史观点的发展，作了一个简短的述评。恩格斯说：“我之所以要这样做，主要是因为带有沙文主义情绪的英国原始历史学派，仍然尽可能地抹煞摩尔根底发现对于原始历史见解所产生的革命，然而这一学派却丝毫不客气地把摩尔根研究所得的成果，掠为己有。而在其他各国，也间常有十二分热心地仿效英国的这一榜样的。”
    我们还可以看看列宁。列宁在他那本“帝国主义论”的书里，利用了英国社会自由主义学者霍柏森的著作和奥国经济学家希法亭的著作。列宁除开在引证他们的地方都加以注明外，并且指出他们的著作虽然有错误的观点，但也有其价值。
    我们要以马克思主义经典作家的这种写作态度为榜样，树立起学术界的诚实勤恳的风气，并把那些无可救药的冒牌学者，从学术界的队伍里清除出去，不管他们有多么高的虚名和地位！
