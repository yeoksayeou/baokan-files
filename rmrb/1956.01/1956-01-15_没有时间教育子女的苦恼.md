To the Editor:

    I am a staff member of the Sichuan Provincial Labor Bureau, and my wife works at the Chengdu Eastern District Cadre Spare-Time School. We have five children, who are looked after only by my younger sister. Because our spare time is not guaranteed, we rarely have time to educate our children.

    My wife works at the spare-time school, where she has office work during the day and lectures in the evening. She returns home around 11 o'clock every night, when the children are already asleep, and gets up after six o'clock in the morning, before the children have awakened. She only has about half an hour for lunch and dinner at home. As a result, the children are very distant from their mother, and sometimes when they fall and cry, they only call for their father, not their mother. I also have very little spare time. The children love to hear stories, so I have to sacrifice some of my own rest time to satisfy their demands. However, because of this, some leading comrades criticize me for being "detached from the masses and undisciplined."

    My eldest son, Tian Shengfu, has picked up some bad habits because he does not receive the education he should. When he sees people pulling carts passing by the door, he climbs on the carts with some other children, and once he fell and almost broke his head. He has learned to curse with all sorts of nasty words. He curses whenever he encounters something unpleasant. He is always covered in mud from head to toe, his eating habits are irregular, and his clothes are ragged. Seeing this, my wife has cried several times in sorrow.

    Some people have criticized us for being "too permissive" and "not disciplining" our children properly. We understand that educating children is the responsibility of parents, and we are willing to educate our children well. However, we do not have the time to educate our children; moreover, mentioning this issue will get us labeled as "backward." I want to appeal: give us the necessary spare time so that we can educate our children well.

### 没有时间教育子女的苦恼

    没有时间教育子女的苦恼编辑同志：
    我是四川省劳动局的工作人员，我的爱人在成都市东城区干部业余学校工作。我家有五个孩子，只有我的一个妹妹看管。因为我们的业余时间得不到保证，我们很少有时间对孩子们进行教育。
    我的爱人在业余学校里，白天要办公，晚上还要讲课。她每天晚上11点左右回家，孩子们都睡了，早上六点多起床，孩子们还没有醒；中午和下午回家吃饭的时间，也不过半小时。这样，孩子们同母亲就很疏远，甚至有时跌了交哭起来也只喊爸爸，不喊妈妈。我的业余时间同样很少，孩子们爱听讲故事，我只有牺牲了自己的一些休息时间来满足孩子们的要求。但是，因为这样，有些领导同志就批评我“脱离群众，自由散漫。”
    我的大儿子田笙浮，因为得不到应有的教育，已经学了一些不好的习惯。他看到拉板车的从门前经过，就同一些孩子们一起爬板车，有一次摔了下来，几乎把头摔破。他学会了用各种各样难听的话骂人，他一遇到不如意的事情就乱骂一气。他整天弄得满脸满身都是泥，吃饭不正常，穿的破破烂烂。看到这种情况，我的爱人伤心地哭了好几次。
    曾经有人责备我们对孩子“太放纵”，“不好好管教”。我们懂得教育孩子是父母的责任，我们也愿意好好教育孩子。但是，我们却没有时间来教育孩子；而且一提起这个问题，还会被扣上“落后”的大帽子。我要呼吁：给我们必要的业余时间，使我们能够很好地教育孩子。
