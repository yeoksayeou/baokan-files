    An upsurge of learning advanced agricultural production technology has emerged in the rural areas of Zhejiang Province. Many regions have organized agricultural bumper harvest visiting groups and farmer reporting groups to visit bumper harvest areas and agricultural production cooperatives, or to go to other places to impart technology. In early January, the Jiaxing Special District had already organized more than 1,200 agricultural labor models, agricultural production cooperative directors, technicians, and some cadres from 15 counties, in batches, to study the high-yield experience of planting double-cropping rice, cotton, and ramie in counties such as Yin County, Ciqi County, and Xiaoshan County. The visiting groups sent by various counties in the Ningbo Special District not only visited high-yield units in their own district and province, but also planned to send representatives to cotton-producing areas in Hunan, Jiangsu, Sichuan and other provinces.
    Through learning and summarizing bumper harvest experiences, various parts of Zhejiang Province have overcome complacency and conservatism, and expanded this year's grain production increase plan. Shaoxing County plans to expand the planting of double-cropping rice by 380,000 to 400,000 mu this year, an increase of 26 to 30 times compared to last year.
    The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture has also summarized the cultivation techniques of double-cropping rice, intercropping rice, sweet potatoes, corn, etc., based on the typical high-yield harvests of various crops last year, and plans to promote them throughout the province.

    浙江农村掀起学习先进农业生产技术的高潮
    浙江省农村中出现学习先进农业生产技术的高潮。许多地区都组织农业丰产访问团和农民报告团，到丰收的地区和农业生产合作社参观，或者到外地传授技术。1月上旬，嘉兴专区已经组织15个县的农业劳动模范、农业生产合作社社长和技术员、部分干部1，200多人，分批到鄞县、慈谿、萧山等县学习种植连作稻、棉花、络麻等作物的丰产经验。宁波专区各县派出的访问团，不仅访问了本区、本省的丰产单位，他们还准备派出代表到湖南、江苏、四川等省棉区访问。
    通过学习和总结丰产经验，浙江省各地都克服了自满保守思想，扩大了今年粮食增产计划。绍兴县今年计划扩种38万到40万亩连作稻，比去年增加26倍到30倍。
    浙江省农业厅也根据去年各项农作物高额丰收的典型，总结出了连作稻、间作稻、甘薯、玉米等的耕作技术，准备在全省推广。（据新华社讯）
