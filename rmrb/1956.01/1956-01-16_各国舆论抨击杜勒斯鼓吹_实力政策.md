Global Public Opinion Criticizes Dulles for Advocating "Policy of Strength"

	Britain
	British political figures and newspapers continue to comment on U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' interview with "Life" magazine. Reuters pointed out that in Britain, there is "growing resentment" about Dulles' statement that Britain had agreed to a "joint action" including the use of atomic weapons in Indochina. Reuters reported that a British Foreign Office spokesman "refuted Dulles' claim."
	The Conservative newspaper "Yorkshire Post," known in Britain as the mouthpiece of Eden, expressed doubt about Dulles' claim that his threat with atomic bombs influenced the policies of the People's Republic of China. The newspaper's editorial said: "If Dulles did indeed threaten to use atomic weapons, was he bluffing? If it was a bluff, then, to put it bluntly, he was wrong. Any bluff is wrong, especially a bluff in diplomacy. It is the weapon of fools. Those who use such weapons will inevitably suffer..."
	The "Daily Mail" called Dulles' remarks a "dance of death" and wrote: "If this is an art, as Dulles says, then it is the most terrible art we have encountered. One wrong step and the artist will fall down with his atomic bomb."
	France
	"Combat" wrote that Dulles "has never been a 'peacemaker.' ...The Secretary of State now believes that the convening of the Geneva Conference (on Indochina and Korean issues) should be attributed to the firmness of the United States and his personal determination, which is an excessive distortion of the facts."
	"Combat" believes that Dulles' threatening remarks are "offensive" and "do not conform to the actual situation." It added that "Dulles carries out his policies as if his country still maintains a monopoly on atomic bombs." "Combat" said that Dulles "is very familiar with the art of approaching the 'brink of war' (although this is also questionable), but he does not know that it is ridiculous for a tightrope walker to boast that he can go beyond the end of the rope... In the eyes of many people in the West and Asia, Dulles has become an unimpressive magician after making this new speech."
	India
	The "National Herald" said in an editorial that while large segments of the world's population are calling for a ban on hydrogen bomb testing and the United States' refusal to comply has caused serious anxiety, Dulles has publicly claimed that the United States has twice used atomic bomb threats in recent years.
	The editorial refuted Dulles' claim that the atomic war threat prevented the breakdown of the Korean armistice talks, and pointed out that those who understand China's policies believe that it is difficult to believe that China resumed negotiations under the pressure of this threat, because no matter what atomic violence the United States might use, China cannot be conquered, and the world would turn away from the United States in disgust.
	A columnist for the "Indian Times" wrote: "If Dulles' intention is to come to New Delhi to elaborate on what he said in Washington, then we had better advise him to forgo the trip." He said that Dulles is a genius who "says the wrong thing at the wrong time."
	Denmark
	"Politiken's" editorial wrote: "Dulles' words can be understood as: he has tried two or three times to find a way to start an atomic war." The newspaper said that Dulles' claim is not in line with the actual situation, and during the Korean War, "no one dared to advocate risking war against China, except for the most arrogant senators."
	Sweden
	"Dagens Nyheter" emphasized that Dulles has always advocated a "policy of strength." Stockholm's "Expressen" published an editorial saying: "Dulles' rude (to put it mildly) remarks have damaged his own country and his own policies, and have aroused the anti-American sentiment that already exists in Britain and many European countries."
	Norway
	A foreign affairs commentator for Norway's "Morgenposten," commenting on Dulles' claim that the United States had been on the brink of war three times in Asia, wrote that Dulles' own admission is counterproductive, both for his own country and for Western countries. In addition, he told a lie, because the positive results of the Geneva negotiations were not obtained by the United States threatening to use atomic weapons.
	United States
	Stevenson, who has announced that he will participate in the Democratic Party's presidential nomination campaign, accused Dulles' so-called "art of going to the brink of war" of "playing with the life of the country." He believes that Dulles' "shocking remarks" "involve the entire fate and credibility of the United States."
	According to a United Press report, Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee accused Dulles' remarks on the 14th as being "stupid and lying."
	Democratic Senator Morse said that in this hydrogen bomb era, Dulles' approach to diplomacy is extremely dangerous. He said, "If you follow that policy, one day you will lose your footing and fall off the edge."
	The "New York Post" criticized Dulles' remarks as a "big mistake," "creating a political chaos in the free world" and causing "discord and disappointment." The newspaper believes that "the most serious doubts" have been raised as to whether he should continue to serve as Secretary of State.
	The "New York Times" published an editorial entitled "The Storm Around Dulles," believing that this storm was "caused by some unwise words of Dulles." The editorial said: "This is at least an extreme example of how not to do diplomatic work."
	The "Washington Post" wrote that the "strong impression created" by Dulles' remarks "is as if we dropped a bomb on London." The newspaper emphasized that Dulles' speech seems to "point out that the closer you get to war, the more it helps peace... Other countries will find this article very unpleasant..."
	New York's "World-Telegram and Sun" accused Dulles in an editorial of attempting to tamper with history and "rewrite diplomatic failures as victories."

### 各国舆论抨击杜勒斯鼓吹“实力政策”

    各国舆论抨击杜勒斯鼓吹“实力政策”
    英国
    英国政界人物和报纸继续评论美国国务卿杜勒斯对“生活”杂志发表的谈话。路透社指出，在英国，对杜勒斯说的英国曾经同意在印度支那采取包括使用原子武器的“联合行动”的话“越来越感到愤慨”。路透社报道说，英国外交部发言人“驳斥了杜勒斯的这种说法”。
    在英国被称为是艾登的喉舌的保守党报纸“约克郡邮报”对杜勒斯所说的他用原子弹进行的威胁影响了中华人民共和国的政策的说法表示怀疑。报纸的社论说：“如果杜勒斯的确曾经以使用原子武器进行威胁，那末是不是他在虚张声势呢？如果这是虚张声势，那么不客气地说一句，他是错了。凡是虚张声势都是错误，特别是在外交上虚张声势。这是糊涂人的武器。使用这种武器的人终不免要遭殃的……”
    “每日邮报”把杜勒斯的谈话称为“死亡舞”，并且写道：“如果像杜勒斯所说的那样，这是一种艺术，那么这是我们所碰到过的最可怕的艺术。一个不正确的步骤，就会使艺术家同自己的原子弹一起掉下来。”
    法国
    “战斗报”写道，杜勒斯“从来也没有做过‘和平缔造者’。……国务卿现在认为，（关于印度支那和朝鲜问题的）日内瓦会议的召开应当归功于美国的坚定和他个人的决心，那是过度歪曲事实了”。
    “战斗报”认为杜勒斯的威胁性言论是“令人讨厌的”，“不符合事情的实际情况”。它又说，“杜勒斯执行他的政策的方式，就好像他的国家还保持着对原子弹的垄断似的”。“战斗报”说，杜勒斯“很熟悉接近‘战争边缘’的艺术（虽然在这方面也还值得怀疑），但是他不知道，走绳索的人，如果夸口说他能够走到绳索尽头以外去，那是很可笑的……在西方和亚洲的许多人看来，杜勒斯在发表这次新的谈话之后，已经成为一个不高明的魔术家”。
    印度
    “国民先驱报”在社论里说，当全世界广大阶层人民要求禁止试验氢弹而美国的拒绝这种要求引起了严重不安的时候，杜勒斯却扬言近几年来美国两次使用了原子弹威胁。
    社论驳斥杜勒斯的所谓原子战争威胁阻止了朝鲜停战谈判破裂的说法，并且指出：了解中国的政策的人们认为，很难相信中国是在这种威胁的压力下才恢复谈判的，因为不管美国可能使用什么原子暴力，中国都是不能被征服的，而全世界却会因为厌恶而离开美国。
    “印度时报”的一位专栏作家写道：“如果杜勒斯的打算是要到新德里来发挥他在华盛顿所说过的话，那末我们最好还是劝他免去此行。”他说，杜勒斯是一个“在错误的时机说错误的话”的天才。
    丹麦
    “政治报”的社论写道：“杜勒斯的话可以这样理解：他曾经两三次想要设法发动原子战争。”这家报纸说，杜勒斯的说法是不符合实际情况的，在朝鲜战争时期，“除了那些最狂妄的参议员以外，没有人敢主张冒险对中国发动战争”。
    瑞典
    “晨报”强调指出杜勒斯一向就鼓吹“实力政策”。斯德哥尔摩“快报”发表社论说：“杜勒斯的粗鲁的（说得温和些）谈话已经对他自己的国家和他自己的政策造成了损害，而且激起了现在已经在英国和欧洲许多国家存在的反美情绪。”
    挪威
    挪威“晨邮报”外交评论员在评论杜勒斯所谓美国在亚洲曾经三次濒于战争的边缘这种说法的时候写道，杜勒斯自己的这种承认，无论是对自己的国家或是对西方国家都是吃力不讨好的。此外，他还说了假话，因为日内瓦谈判的积极结果并不是美国威胁要使用原子武器才得到的。
    美国
    已经宣布要参加民主党总统候选人提名竞选的史蒂文森，指责杜勒斯所谓“走向战争边缘的艺术”是“把国家的生命当作儿戏”。他认为杜勒斯的“令人吃惊的谈话”“涉及美国的整个命运和信誉”。
    据合众社消息，参议院外交委员会的民主党委员们14日指责杜勒斯的谈话是“愚蠢和撒谎”。
    民主党参议员莫尔斯说，在这种氢弹时代，杜勒斯这种方式的外交是极端危险的。他说，“如果你遵循那种政策，有一天你会失足从边缘掉下去。”
    “纽约邮报”批评杜勒斯的谈话是“大错”，“已经在自由世界制造了一阵政治混乱”，造成了“不和和失望”。这家报纸认为对于是否还应该让他继续担任国务卿一节已经引起了“最严重的怀疑”。
    “纽约时报”以“杜勒斯周围的风暴”为题发表社论，认为这种风暴是“由于杜勒斯的一些不智的话而引起的”。社论说：“这至少是一个说明不该做外交工作的极端例子。”
    “华盛顿邮报”写道，杜勒斯的谈话“所引起的强烈印象，就好像我们向伦敦抛了一颗炸弹似的”。报纸强调指出，杜勒斯的讲话好像“指出，你越走近战争，就越有助于和平……其他国家将认为这篇文章是非常令人不快的……”
    纽约“世界电讯与太阳报”在社论中指责杜勒斯企图窜改历史，“把外交上的失败改写为胜利”。
