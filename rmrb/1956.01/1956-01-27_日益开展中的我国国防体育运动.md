　　Since 1952, China's national defense sports movement has been gradually developing in major and medium-sized cities across the country. The vast number of young people have developed a strong interest in shooting, motorcycles, radio, military camping, and other national defense sports.

　　Among the national defense sports, the most widely practiced is shooting. Many cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, and Hohhot, have launched shooting activities. In Beijing alone, more than 27,900 young people have participated. During the two days of the Spring Festival holiday last year, more than 2,000 young people from government organizations participated in shooting competitions. During the summer vacation, 2,805 enthusiasts from universities and middle schools in the capital participated in shooting training. Every day, as soon as the sky turned slightly gray, they rushed from the eastern, western, southern, and northern suburbs to the Temple of Heaven shooting range to learn how to shoot. At the end of August, more than 20 young workers from 9 factories and enterprises in Beijing and many students participated in the "Beijing Shooting Backbone Athlete Training Class," some of whom reached the level of third-grade shooters after a short period of training. Workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant also built a shooting range through voluntary labor during holidays to practice shooting. Beijing No. 3 Middle School, No. 24 Middle School, and the Middle School attached to Tsinghua University also used a corner of the playground to practice air rifle shooting.

　　With the development of shooting sports, the level of shooting sports in China has gradually improved. Last November, at the International Friendship Shooting Competition held in Beijing, the Chinese shooting delegation won fourth place in the overall score, and athlete Li Suping won the women's individual optional small-bore rifle standing shooting championship.

　　Motorcycle sports have also gradually developed in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and other places, with a total of 2,499 young men and women participating in this sport, of which 591 have become amateur instructors. Last October, China's motorcycle sports team went to Romania to participate in the International Friendship Motorcycle Competition. A total of 7 countries participated in this competition, and China's men's and women's teams both won fourth place.

　　Many young people are greatly interested in radio activities. In Beijing alone, 1,721 young people and teenagers have learned the principles and production methods of crystal radios, single-tube radios, and AC four-tube radios.

　　Throughout the country, from Urumqi in the northwest to Fuzhou on the southeast coast, military camping activities have been widely carried out. The content of military camping activities is novel and rich, including marching, night sentry duty, obstacle crossing, drill coaching, tactical coaching, grenade exercises, capturing red flags, attacking strongholds, raiding camps, and various cultural and sports activities. In Beijing alone, 30,530 people have participated in weekend military camping and student military camping.

　　In coastal cities with suitable conditions, young people actively participated in navigation sports. In Qingdao, more than 6,000 young people – students, workers, and staff of government organizations – regularly participate in 11 activities of the Qingdao Navigation Club, including maritime military, maritime communications, marine engine, electrical engineering, armed swimming, large and small sampans, single-person boats, sailing, water motorcycles, and ship models. In the short 35 days of last summer vacation, the Qingdao Navigation Club held 9 training courses for sampan and sailing sports, ship model sports backbone training courses, and maritime military knowledge and maritime communications backbone training courses, training more than 1,280 people in total. During the celebration of the 28th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day, an "August 1st" maritime tour was also held. The athletes skillfully drove the "Peace Wheel," motorboats, and 20 sampans and sailboats, sailing in the turbulent Yellow Sea. From starting the engine to steering, measuring the direction, and determining the position... all activities were operated by the young male and female "navigators" themselves. During the journey, the athletes practiced various formation sailing and changing formations, and also conducted exercises in armed swimming landing and sampan team landing.

　　Ship model sports are also very active in 20 middle schools in Qingdao. Young people manufacture models of many "escort boats," "battleships," "torpedo boats," and "small merchant ships," and they often take them to specially made 35-meter-long pools for competitions. The electrically powered battleship model with automated devices created and made by Li Jigang and other four young pioneers from Qingdao No. 9 Middle School ran so fast and steadily, looking like a small warship, and was rated as a special prize at the National Children's Science and Technology and Craft Works Exhibition.

　　The Guangzhou and Shanghai Navigation Clubs and the Beijing Shichahai and Harbin Water Sports Stations organized 7,547 people to participate in various water sports. On October 9 last year, the Beijing Students' "Youth Cup" rowing competition had 1,060 athletes from 52 middle schools and primary schools participating.

　　Young people have different interests and hobbies. Some want to be sailors, learn navigation, and learn shipbuilding; others are particularly fascinated by becoming airmen, flying airplanes, and building airplanes. The increasingly active aviation model movement is loved by tens of thousands of young people in more than 70 cities across the country. They often make friends with kites, balloons, and various model airplanes – from paper-folded to wooden, from those without power equipment to those with small engines – and often visit airports, aviation colleges, and communicate, meet, and have parties with air force heroes and air force soldiers. "Today we are little eagles, tomorrow we will be the defenders and builders of the motherland's airspace." This is the common ideal of thousands of aviation model group members. Many young people in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Liaoning, Henan, Sichuan and other places have realized their dreams. Some were aviation model group members yesterday, and today they have stepped into air force flight schools, aviation industry schools, aviation colleges, and aviation factories, and some have even been sent to the Soviet Union to study aviation.

　　The young people of Chongqing love the parachute tower jumping sport very much. In the past year or so, 5,081 young people from 72 factories, schools, and government organizations have performed 39,000 parachute jumps of various types, day and night. Many athletes have jumped more than 100 times, and more than 400 people have basically mastered parachute jumping techniques and obtained parachute jumping certificates. Many units have also established parachute jumping sports groups. Last summer vacation, 16 parachute jumping sports group members from graduating high school students of Chongqing No. 1 Middle School were admitted to the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics.

　　Last year, China's parachute jumping team went to Sofia to participate in the International Friendship Parachute Jumping Competition. Hu Kegan, a 19-year-old youth league member from Chongqing No. 1 Middle School, and Song Guangxi from No. 3 Middle School, participated in parachute tower jumping and also performed 23 parachute jumps from airplanes.

　　In order to widely promote parachute jumping, this year Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, Wuhan, Kaifeng, Chongqing, Xi'an and other cities have established large and small parachute towers and parachute tower jumping sports clubs. The large parachute tower in Beijing has been completed. In the future, colorful parachutes will be seen everywhere in the vast sky of the motherland.

　　Gliding is the beginning of flight. Many of the students in China's first gliding school, who come from all over the country, are aviation model group members from various places. These young people, who have loved playing with bamboo dragonflies and small airplanes since childhood, have had their long-cherished dream of flying into the sky finally realized. This gliding school will continuously train gliding instructors for the development of gliding sports in the motherland.

　　National defense sports is sports for preparing defenders of the country. As He Long, director of the Sports Commission, said: "National defense sports is a more practical sport. It aims to cultivate a large number of modern national defense reserve forces and support the national defense construction of the motherland. It is a very good social education work of military knowledge." China's national defense sports movement is still very young. In order to gradually meet the growing demands of the broad masses of the people, the Central National Defense Sports Club will establish shooting, motorcycle, radio and other sports clubs, aviation clubs, parachute tower jumping clubs, and gliding sports stations in key cities, navigation clubs in coastal cities, and water sports stations in places along rivers and lakes. China's national defense sports will develop vigorously with the development of the national economy. (Attached picture)

    日益开展中的我国国防体育运动
    群力
    从1952年以来，我国国防体育运动逐步在全国各个大、中城市开展起来。广大青少年对射击、摩托车、无线电和军事野营，以及其他各项国防体育运动已经有了强烈的爱好。
    在国防体育运动中，开展得最广泛的是射击运动。北京、天津、上海、沈阳、长春、哈尔滨、南京、武汉、广州、重庆、成都、西安、呼和浩特等许多城市都开展了射击运动。只北京一地就有27，900多个青年参加。在去年春节假日的两天里，有2，000多名机关青年进行了射击比赛。暑假里，首都大、中学校有2，805个爱好者参加了射击训练。每当天刚泛着鱼肚白，他们从东郊、西郊、南城、北城赶到天坛射击运动场学射击。8月底，北京市9个工厂企业的20多个青年工人和许多学生参加了“北京市射击骨干运动训练班”，其中有的人经短期训练后，都达到了三级射手标准。石景山发电厂的工人，还在假日用义务劳动修建了靶场，练习射击。北京市第三中学、第二十四中学、清华大学附属中学等也利用操场的一角练习汽枪射击。
    随着射击运动的开展，我国射击运动的水平逐步提高。去年11月，在北京举行的国际友谊射击竞赛大会，我国射击代表团获得总分第四名，运动员李素萍获得女子自选小口径运动步枪立射冠军。
    摩托车运动也已经在北京、天津、上海、沈阳、哈尔滨、武汉、广州、重庆等地逐渐开展起来了，共有2，499个男女青年参加了这项运动，其中有591人已经成了业余辅导员。去年10月，我国摩托车运动代表队到罗马尼亚参加了国际友谊摩托车竞赛大会。这次比赛共有7个国家参加，我国的男子队和女子队都获得了第四名。
    许多青少年对无线电活动感到极大兴趣。仅北京就有1，721名青年和少年学习了矿石收音机、单管机、交流四灯机的原理和制作方法。
    在全国各地，从西北的乌鲁木齐到东南沿海的福州，都普遍开展了军事野营活动。军事野营活动的内容新颖、丰富，有行军、夜间放哨、超越障碍、队列教练、战术教练、手榴弹演习、夺红旗、攻据点、偷营和各种文化体育活动。北京一地就有30，530人参加过周末军事野营和学生军事野营。
    在沿海有条件的城市，青少年们踊跃参加了航海运动。青岛市有6，000多个青少年——学生、工人、机关工作人员经常参加青岛航海俱乐部的海上军事、海上通讯、轮机、电工、武装游泳、大、小舢舨、单人艇、驶帆、水上摩托、舰船模型等11项活动。青岛航海俱乐部在去年暑期短短的35天中，举办了9期舢舨及驶帆运动训练班，舰船模型运动骨干训练班，海上军事知识、海上通讯骨干训练班，共训练了1，280多人。在庆祝“八一”建军节28周年的时候，还举办了“八一”海上旅行。运动员们熟练地驾驶着“和平轮”、汽艇和20艘舢舨、帆船，在海波奔腾的黄海中航行。从开机器到掌舵、测方向、定方位……全部活动，都由年轻的男女“航海家”们自己操作。在旅行途中，运动员们演习了各种编队航行、变换队形，还进行了武装游泳登陆、舢舨队员登陆的演习。
    舰船模型运动在青岛市的20个中等学校里也很活跃。青少年们制造许多“护航艇”、“战列舰”、“雷击舰”和“小商船”的模型，他们常常拿到特制的35公尺长的水池里比赛。青岛市第九中学少年先锋队员李纪纲等四人创造和制作的、带有自动化装置的电动战列舰模型，跑起来是那样神迅、稳健，活像一艘小军舰，在全国少年儿童科学技术和工艺作品展览会上被评为特等奖。
    广州、上海航海俱乐部和北京什刹海、哈尔滨的水上运动站组织了7，547人参加各种水上运动。去年10月9日，北京市学生“青少年杯”划船运动会就有52个中学和小学的1，060名运动员参加比赛。
    青少年们的志趣、爱好不同，有的人想当海军，学航海，学造船；有的人特别醉心于当空军、驾飞机、造飞机。日益活跃的航空模型运动，受到全国70多个城市、数以万计的青少年的热爱。他们时常和风筝、气球、各种模型飞机——从纸折的到木制的、从不装动力设备的到装有小发动机的——交朋友，还常常参观飞机场、航空学院，并和空军英雄、空军战士通信、会见、联欢。“今天我们是小神鹰，明天将是祖国领空的保卫者和建设者。”这是千千万万个航空模型组员们的共同理想。北京、天津、上海、辽宁、河南、四川等地有许多青年实现了自己的愿望。有的昨天还是航空模型组员，今天已踏进空军飞行学校、航空工业学校、航空学院、航空工厂，有的还被派往苏联学航空。
    重庆市的青少年非常热爱伞塔跳伞运动。一年多来，已有72个工厂、学校、机关的5，081个青年进行了39，000多次的白天、夜间的各种跳伞。不少运动员已跳过100次以上，有400多人基本上掌握了跳伞技术，得到了跳伞证。许多单位还建立了跳伞运动小组。去年暑假，重庆市第一中学高中毕业生中就有16个跳伞运动小组组员考进了北京航空学院。
    去年，我国的跳伞运动代表队去索非亚参加了国际友谊跳伞比赛。19岁的青年团员、重庆市第一中学的胡可淦和第三中学的宋广熙，参加了伞塔跳伞后，还在飞机上进行过23次跳伞。
    为了广泛开展跳伞运动，今年北京、天津、上海、沈阳、大连、哈尔滨、武汉、开封、重庆、西安等城市分别建立大、小跳伞塔和伞塔跳伞运动俱乐部。北京的大跳伞塔已经建成。将来，在祖国辽阔的天空到处都可以看到飘荡着的彩色缤纷的伞花。
    滑翔是飞行的开端。我国第一个滑翔学校中来自祖国四面八方的学员们，有许多是各地的航空模型组员，这些从小就喜欢和竹蜻蜓、小飞机做朋友的青年，多少年来日夜盼望飞上天空的愿望，现在已经实现了。这个滑翔学校将为祖国开展滑翔运动不断输送滑翔教练人员。
    国防体育是准备卫国者的体育。正如体育运动委员会主任贺龙说的：“国防体育是更富于实用性的体育，它是以培养大量现代化国防后备队，支援祖国国防建设为目的的，是一项很好的军事知识的社会教育工作。”我国的国防体育运动还很年轻。中央国防体育俱乐部为逐步适应广大人民群众日益增长的要求，将在重点城市分别建立射击、摩托车、无线电等运动俱乐部、航空俱乐部、伞塔跳伞俱乐部、滑翔运动站，在沿海城市建立航海俱乐部，在依江傍湖的地方建立水上运动站。我国的国防体育将随着国家经济建设的发展日益蓬勃地开展起来。（附图片）
