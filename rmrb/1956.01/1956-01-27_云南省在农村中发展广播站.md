    Yunnan Province has established 1,028 radio stations in inland and border areas. The establishment of radio stations has been welcomed by the vast number of farmers. In some areas, farmers, upon hearing that loudspeakers were to be installed, voluntarily donated wooden poles and helped with wiring.
    According to the needs of the vast rural areas, Yunnan Province has formulated a plan for developing the rural broadcasting network. The plan stipulates that this year, 50 new and expanded central broadcasting stations will be built in 50 counties and cities in the inland and border areas that already have electricity. 15,000 loudspeakers will be installed in agricultural production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and township people's committees, etc., that already have telephone lines. After this year's plan is realized, it is estimated that the number of people regularly listening to the radio in rural areas will increase by more than 20 times compared to 1955. By 1962, in addition to the county and city wired broadcasting stations, 400 collective farms and 20 large state-owned farms will also establish broadcasting stations, installing 300,000 loudspeakers, striving to ensure that all agricultural production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and some farmers' households have listening devices.

    云南省在农村中发展广播站
    云南省已在内地和边疆地区建立了1，028个收音站。收音站的建立，受到广大农民的欢迎，有些地区的农民听说要安装大喇叭了，自动地捐助木杆，帮助架线。
    根据广大农村的需要，云南省已对发展农村广播网作出规划。规划中规定：今年将在内地和边疆地区已有电源的50个县、市新建和扩建50个中心广播站，在已有电话线的农业生产合作社、供销合作社和乡人民委员会等处，安装喇叭15，000只。今年的计划实现后，预计农村经常收听广播的人数，将比1955年增加20倍以上。到1962年，除县、市有线广播站外，还将建立400个集体农庄和20个大型国营农场的广播站，安装30万只喇叭，争取达到所有农业生产合作社、供销合作社和部分农户家中都有收听工具。　　（云南广播电台编辑部）
