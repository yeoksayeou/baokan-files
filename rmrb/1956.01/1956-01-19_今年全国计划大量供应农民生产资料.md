Xinhua News Agency, 18th. In order to meet the requirements for production materials in rural areas after the great development of the agricultural cooperative movement, the country plans to promote and supply various production materials this year, greatly exceeding last year. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various provinces and regions have also universally carried out pre-sale work for various major production materials.

This year, the country plans to promote a total of 4 million sets of two-wheeled double-share plows and two-wheeled single-share plows, more than 8 times that of last year. The supply of agricultural tools such as seeders, harvesters, and disc harrows is equivalent to twice the sales volume of last year. It is planned to supply and organize the supply of more than 25.4 million tons of various fertilizers, of which the supply of granular fertilizers is equal to 10 times that of last year, and the supply of chemical fertilizers exceeds 50% of last year's figure. The supply of various pesticides and machinery is also several times greater than last year's supply. The prevention and control area of these pesticides and machinery can reach 42.4% of the country's sown area. In terms of livestock supply, in addition to the local supply and marketing cooperatives purchasing and regulating between regions, it is also planned to import 40,000 horses from the Mongolian People's Republic.

According to the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, the allocation of some production materials has already begun, and more than 800,000 sets of two-wheeled double-share plows and two-wheeled single-share plows supplied to rural areas in the first quarter will be delivered to farmers before spring plowing.

At present, supply and marketing cooperatives in Jiangsu, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei and other provinces and regions have universally started pre-selling various production materials. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups have signed pre-purchase contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives. In order to solve the difficulties of insufficient funds for some farmers, the supply and marketing cooperatives will combine the pre-sale of various production materials with the purchase of agricultural and sideline products. Banks will also combine this with the issuance of agricultural loans. The down payment paid by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups when signing pre-sale contracts will be given interest at the deposit rate of credit cooperatives when the supply and marketing cooperatives deliver the goods. The prices of new agricultural tools are based on the retail prices at the time of delivery, and the prices of livestock do not exceed the normal local market prices. After the implementation of pre-sales, supply and marketing agencies below the county level will implement direct transportation to shorten transportation time and avoid blind round-trip transportation.

    今年全国计划大量供应农民生产资料
    据新华社18日讯　为了满足农业合作化运动大发展以后农村对生产资料的要求，今年全国计划推广和供应的各种生产资料都大大超过去年。各省区的供销合作社并且普遍开展了对各种主要生产资料的预售工作。
    今年全国计划推广的双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁共计400万部，超过去年8倍多。播种机、收割机、圆盘耙等农具的供应量相当于去年销售量的两倍。计划供应和组织供应的各种肥料达2，540多万吨，其中颗粒肥料的供应量等于去年的10倍，化学肥料超过去年供应数字50％以上。各种农药、药械的供应量也超过去年供应量几倍。这些药、械的防治面积，能达到全国播种面积的42.4％。在耕畜供应方面，除各地供销合作社在地区间购买调剂外，还准备从蒙古人民共和国进口马4万匹。
    据从中华全国供销合作总社了解，现在部分生产资料已经开始调拨，第一季度供应农村的80多万部双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁在春耕生产前要全部送到农民手中。
    现在，江苏、山西、河南、河北等省区的供销合作社已经普遍开始进行对各种生产资料的预售工作。许多地区的农业生产合作社和互助组都纷纷到供销合作社签订预购合同。为解决部分农民资金不足的困难，各地供销合作社在预售各种生产资料的时候，将结合进行收购农业和副业产品等工作。银行还将结合发放农贷。农业生产合作社和互助组在签订预售合同时所交的定金，供销合作社在交货的时候将按信用合作社存款的利率给予利息。新式农具的价格都依交货时的零售价格作价，牲畜价格都不超过当地正常的市场价格。实行预售以后，县以下的供销机构都将实行直接运输，以缩短运送时间，避免盲目的往返调运。
