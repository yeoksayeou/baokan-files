    Turning Useless Utensils into Useful Materials
    Ma Jisong
    In our country's folk traditions, there are a large number of utensils made of tin-lead alloy scattered about, such as teapots, wine pots, candlesticks, incense burners, washbasins, pen holders, and so on. Compared with foreign porcelain and ceramic utensils, these utensils are more expensive, heavier, and less attractive. According to doctors' analysis, using tin-lead alloy for eating utensils can also easily lead to poisoning. Therefore, people are becoming less and less interested in these utensils. Farmers are also seeing more and more clearly that it is not Guanyin Bodhisattva and saviors who help them get rid of hunger and poverty, but the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Therefore, those superstitious items (such as candlesticks, incense burners, etc.) have also been left idle. Lead and tin also have broad uses in industry. The manufacture of water pipes, cables, bearing alloys, solders, etc., cannot do without lead and tin. However, the amount of lead produced annually from existing mines cannot meet the industrial demand. Therefore, it is very meaningful to collect and utilize the tin-lead alloy utensils scattered among the people.
    In order to turn these useless tin-lead utensils into useful materials, the affiliated processing plant of the Hubei Provincial Branch of the China Minerals Company and the supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions jointly carried out such a task: the supply and marketing cooperatives purchased tin-lead utensils scattered in towns and villages, and the processing plant made them into crude lead and secondary solder. The lead is handed over to the state for unified allocation, and the solder is supplied to the market locally.
    General tin-lead utensils contain about 70% lead. Each ton of old tin-lead utensils can extract nearly 700 kilograms of crude lead and nearly 300 kilograms of solder. The purchase price of each ton of old tin-lead utensils is more than 1,600 yuan, and the processing cost is 60 yuan, while the extracted crude lead is worth 2,160 yuan per ton, and the solder is worth 3,680 yuan per ton. This means that without a large amount of investment and complicated processing, a large amount of useful materials can be provided to the country. The affiliated processing plant of the Hubei Provincial Minerals Branch has a total of only 10 small furnaces and more than 40 employees, but in the past 3 years, it has created more than 46 million yuan of wealth for the country. Their planned processing of lead last year was more than 3,700 tons.
    When the business of recycling old tin-lead utensils first started, some staff members thought that this work was "too fragmented" and "too troublesome." They thought that the masses did not have many old tin-lead utensils stored, and they would be almost "collected clean" after one or two purchases; others thought that the masses were unwilling to sell these utensils after their living conditions improved. The company sent people to the countryside to investigate and found that in Shilang Township, Lichuan County, one agricultural production cooperative alone had more than 100 jin of old tin-lead utensils that only 15% of its members needed to sell. The masses were also happy to sell these old utensils to the state. In particular, after the farmers understood the relationship between national industrialization and their own vital interests, they were willing to support national industrialization in various aspects, and more people sold old tin-lead utensils. One agricultural production cooperative's chairman sold the old tin utensils he had collected for decades to the cooperative after studying the general line. The farmers in the mountainous areas of Hubei Province are even more interested in this business of the cooperatives. They said: "It's useless to leave these things; the cooperatives buying these things allows us to turn useless utensils into funds, which can be used to expand production and improve our lives." In the past 3 years, the Hubei Provincial Minerals Branch has purchased nearly 20,000 tons of old tin-lead utensils through cooperatives. Last year, they expanded their business to 9 provinces including Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, and it is estimated that this year alone, 6,000 tons of crude lead can be produced.

    把无用的器具变成有用的物资
    马基嵩
    在我国民间，散存着大量的锡铅合金制成的器具，如茶壶、酒壶、蜡台、香炉、脸盆、笔架等等。这些用具比起洋磁和瓷器用具来，又贵，又笨重，又不美观。据医生分析，使用这种锡铅合金作的食具还容易中毒。所以人们对这些用具愈来愈不感兴趣。农民们也一天比一天更清楚地看到：帮助自己摆脱饥饿和贫困的，不是观音菩萨和救世主，而是共产党和毛主席。所以，那些迷信用品（如蜡台、香炉等）也被闲置起来了。铅和锡在工业上又有着广阔的用途。制造自来水管、电缆、轴承合金、焊料等都离不了铅和锡。而每年从现有矿山生产的铅又不能满足工业上的要求。因此，把散存在民间的锡铅合金器具搜集起来加以利用是很有意义的。
    为了把这些无用的锡铅器具变为有用的物资，中国矿产公司湖北省分公司的附属加工厂和各地供销合作社共同进行了这样一项工作：供销合作社把散在城镇和农村的锡铅器皿收购上来，由加工厂制成青铅和二级焊锡。铅交给国家统一调配，焊锡则就地供应市场。
    一般的锡铅器具都含铅70％左右。每1吨旧锡铅器皿可提炼出近700公斤的青铅和近300公斤的焊锡。每吨旧锡铅器具的收购价格是1，600多元，加工费用是60元，而提炼出来的青铅却值2，160元1吨，焊锡值3，680元1吨。这就是说，并不需要大量的投资和复杂的加工就可为国家提供大量的有用的物资。湖北省矿产分公司附属加工厂总共只有10多个小炉子和40多名职工，3年来就为国家创造了4，600多万元的财富，他们去年计划加工的铅就有3，700多吨。
    回收旧锡铅器具的业务刚开始的时候，有的工作人员认为这种工作“太零碎”“太麻烦”，群众存的旧锡铅器具又不多，收购一两次就差不多“收干净了”；有的认为群众生活改善以后不愿出卖这些器皿。公司派人下乡调查，发现利川县石龙乡一个农业生产合作社里，只15％的社员就有100多斤旧锡铅用具需要出售。群众也乐于把这些旧器具出售给国家。特别是农民们懂得了国家工业化跟自己的切身关系以后，愿意从各个方面支援国家工业化，出卖旧锡铅用具的就更多了。有一个农业生产合作社的社长，就是在学习总路线以后，把收藏了几十年的旧锡器卖给合作社的。湖北省山区的农民对合作社这项业务更感兴趣，他们说：放着这些东西没有用；合作社收买了这些东西，就使我们把没用的用具变成了资金，可以用来扩大生产，改善生活。3年来，湖北省矿产分公司就通过合作社收购了旧锡铅用具将近两万吨。他们去年又把业务扩大到广东、广西、湖南、河南、陕西、甘肃、四川、云南、贵州等9个省份，预计今年光青铅一项就可以生产6，000吨。
