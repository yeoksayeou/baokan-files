　　Attach Importance to the Merger of Small Cooperatives
    Chang Qing, Deputy Secretary of the Xingtai Prefectural Committee of the CPC
    With the development of the agricultural cooperative movement, small agricultural cooperatives have been unable to meet the requirements for further development of production. Therefore, the expansion or merger of small cooperatives into large cooperatives is an inevitable trend in the current development of the agricultural cooperative movement. Now, based on the merger of small cooperatives in Dukou and Luanxie villages in Shahe County, Xiaolüzhai and Neiqiu County's Daleidong four cooperative villages in Xingtai area, Hebei Province, this issue will be explained.
    Dukou Village began to establish cooperatives in the winter of 1951. By the spring of 1954, the agricultural cooperatives had developed to 24, with cooperative members accounting for 90% of the total number of households in the village. At this time, at the request of most members, a large cooperative of 530 households was formed by merging with the Liu Qingyun Cooperative as the mainstay. Xiaolüzhai Village originally had three cooperatives with 351 households, and in the autumn of 1955, they were merged into one large cooperative. Daleidong Village had seven old and new cooperatives with more than 210 households, which were merged into two large cooperatives before wheat planting in 1955.
    The reason why the agricultural cooperatives in these villages merged was that a series of problems occurred in the production process before the merger of the small cooperatives.
    First of all, agricultural basic construction was greatly restricted. For example, there is irrigated land in the west of Dukou Village. Using a waterwheel to draw water is much more effective than using a windlass, but because each cooperative has land in the west of the village, each cooperative is afraid of buying a waterwheel for other cooperatives to use, and no one is willing to buy it. Daleidong Village originally had the conditions to dig more wells and expand the area of irrigated land, but because the land of the cooperatives was interspersed, Cooperative A waited for Cooperative B to dig, and Cooperative B waited for Cooperative A to dig. As a result, no one dug. At the same time, unified planning, planting according to local conditions, and purchasing new large-scale agricultural tools such as diesel engines and locomotive boilers were also greatly restricted.
    Second, there are many inconveniences in agricultural activities. For example, the land of each cooperative in Dukou Village is scattered in all directions of the village, and the members have to run east and west to work in the fields, wasting a lot of time. When irrigating, because the land of each cooperative is interspersed, they have to go a long way to dig ditches for irrigation.
    At the same time, the cadres of the cooperatives also spent a lot of workdays in meetings. For example, Dukou Village had 24 cooperatives before the merger, and each time the heads and accountants of the cooperatives went to the county and district for meetings, 48 people had to go.
    Third, due to the wide disparity in leadership strength among the small cooperatives, there were great differences in the performance of the cooperatives. For example, the agricultural cooperative led by Li Jinfang in Luanxie Village had six party members and strong leadership. In 1955, the average yield of cotton per mu was 115 jin. The agricultural cooperative led by Li Fuxin had no party members and weak leadership, and the average yield of cotton per mu was only over 70 jin. Of the 17 small cooperatives in this village, five were poorly managed due to weak leadership.
    Fourth, the branches of villages (townships) with multiple cooperatives also encountered great difficulties in implementing unified leadership and implementing policies. For example, Luanxie Village had 17 cooperatives. In 1955, the cotton planting task was 2,400 mu, but cooperatives without party members or with poor party leadership did not implement the plan, and as a result, only 1,533 mu were planted in the whole village.
    Since merging cooperatives is an inevitable trend of objective development, it is necessary to properly solve many new problems. According to the situation of the above four villages, the main problems are that cooperatives with good production are unwilling to merge with cooperatives with poor production; cooperatives with more public property are unwilling to merge with cooperatives with less public property. Poor peasant members are generally more active in merging cooperatives, while middle peasants have more concerns and are afraid of suffering losses after the merger. According to the above situation, in the process of merging cooperatives, we must adhere to the spirit of unity and production, mutual assistance and mutual benefit, democratic consultation, and protection of public property, and rationally handle various economic issues.
    Handling of public property: When Dukou and Luanxie villages merged, each cooperative extracted 6% of the actual total income of the year as public accumulation funds and public welfare funds as public property after the merger. The original public property of each cooperative was unconditionally transferred to the large cooperative after conducting collectivist education for the members. The three cooperatives in Xiaolüzhai Village originally purchased some furniture with public accumulation funds, which were unconditionally transferred to the large cooperative. However, most of the farm tools were purchased from the total income, and they were re-evaluated at the current market price and sold to the large cooperative. The price was distributed to the original members, and the profit and loss part was paid by the original small cooperative from the total income (although these farm tools were paid from the total income, they are actually public property and should not be discounted and distributed to the original members individually).
    Handling of livestock: There are three situations. For example, the draft animals in the 17 cooperatives in Luanxie Village are all privately owned and publicly used, but the work points for the same livestock are inconsistent. After the merger of the large cooperative, the livestock work points were readjusted. Among the five old cooperatives in Daleidong Village, only the draft animals of the Qunying Cooperative were changed from originally publicly owned to privately owned, and the other cooperatives were publicly owned. At the time of the merger, the original price of the publicly owned livestock remained unchanged, and the Qunying Cooperative still belonged to the large cooperative at the original publicly owned price. Because the newly established two new cooperatives would suffer a loss of 20% to 30% if the livestock were discounted at the winter livestock market price, the members agreed to increase the discount by 20% at the current market price. Although the livestock owners still suffer a little loss, they have no objection because the old cooperatives have public accumulation and the new members can also enjoy it.
    Evaluation of the land of the members: The original evaluation of the land of each cooperative is generally reasonable, and the difference between the cooperatives is not large, so it is generally unchanged. Individual pieces of land that are unreasonably evaluated should be adjusted appropriately. Those with more land evaluation problems or large changes should be discussed in more detail. The ratio of land and labor distribution of benefits has been appropriately reduced through the merger of land remuneration in some cases.
    Another major problem in merging cooperatives is the arrangement of the cadres of each cooperative. For the cadres of the original cooperatives, we must, in the principle of promoting unity, carefully and appropriately allocate and arrange them after brewing and democratic discussion among the members. Judging from the situation of the above four villages, the main backbones who were originally fair, capable, and actively managed the cooperatives were generally selected to the leadership positions of the large cooperatives. Those who were not selected as the main cadres of the large cooperatives generally became production team leaders, and they were given patient explanation and education work, so that they still actively and enthusiastically participated in the various work of the cooperatives. In the allocation of cooperative cadres, the leadership composition was also carefully adjusted to establish the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants.

### 重视小型社的合并工作

　　重视小型社的合并工作
    中共邢台地委副书记　常青
    随着农业合作化运动的发展，小型农业合作社已经不能满足进一步发展生产的要求了。因此，小型社扩大或合并为大型社，已经是目前农业合作化运动发展的必然趋势。现在根据河北省邢台地区沙河县的渡口、栾卸，钜鹿县的小吕砦、和内邱县的大垒东四个合作化村小社合并的情况，来说明这个问题。
    渡口村从1951年冬开始办社，到1954年春农业合作社发展到24个，入社农户占全村总农户90％。这时在大多数社员要求下，以刘清云社为主合并成了一个530户的大社。小吕砦村原有三个社，351户，1955年秋合并为一个大社。大垒东村新旧七个社，210多户，在1955年种麦前合并成两个大社。
    这几个村的农业合作社所以合并的原因，是因为小型社在合并以前，生产过程中发生了一系列的问题。
    首先是农业的基本建设受到了很大限制。如渡口村的村西有水浇地，用水车车水比用辘轳拐水效力大得多，但是因为各社村西都有地，那个社也怕买了水车给别的社使用，都不愿买。大垒东村本来有条件多打井，扩大水浇地面积，但是因为社和社的土地插花，甲社等着乙社打，乙社等着甲社打，结果谁都没有打。同时，统一规划，因地种植，购置新式大型农具如柴油机、锅驼机等，也受到了很大限制。
    第二、在农事活动上有许多不便。如渡口村各社土地分散在村的四面八方，社员下地干活跑东绕西，误去很多时间。在浇地的时候，因为各社土地插花，只好绕远道开沟浇水。
    同时，社干部开会也多用了许多劳动日。如渡口村在合并前有24个社，每次社长、会计到县、区开会，就要去48个人。
    第三、各小社之间，由于领导力量强弱悬殊，办社成绩差别很大。如栾卸村李进芳领导的农业合作社有六个党员，领导力量强，1955年棉花每亩平均产115斤。李福信领导的农业合作社没有党员，领导骨干弱，棉花每亩平均只产70多斤。这个村共17个小社，有五个社因领导力量太弱，办的很不好。
    第四、多社的村（乡）的支部在实行统一领导、贯彻执行政策方面也遇到很大困难。如栾卸村17个社，1955年种棉任务共2，400亩，但是没有党员的社或党的领导力量很差的社，不按计划执行，结果全村只种了1，533亩。
    并社既然是客观发展的必然趋势。但是要并社就必须妥善解决许多新问题。根据以上四个村的情况，主要问题是生产好的社不愿和生产差的社合并；公共财产多的社不愿和公共财产少的社合并。贫农社员一般对合并社较积极，中农顾虑较多，怕并了社吃亏。根据以上情况，在并社过程中必须本着团结生产、互助互利、民主协商、保护公共财产的精神，合理地处理各种经济问题。
    对公共财产的处理：渡口、栾卸村在并社的时候，各社都从当年的实际总收入中按6％抽出公积金、公益金，作为并社后的公共财产。各社原有的公共财产，经过对社员进行集体主义教育，一律无偿地转归大社所有。小吕砦村三个社，原有部分家具是用公积金购买的，无偿转归大社。但是大部分农具是从总收入中开支购买的，均按现在市价重新评价，卖给了大社，价款分给原来社员，赔亏部分由原小社作为损益从总收入内开支（这些农具，虽然是从总收入内开支的，但是实际上还是公共财产，不应该折价分给原社员个人）。
    对牲畜的处理：有三种情况，如栾卸村17个社耕畜都是私有公用，但是同等牲畜工分不一致，合并大社后重新调整了牲畜工分。大垒东村五个老社中，只有群英社的耕畜是由原来公有改为私有的，其他社都是公有。在合并的时候，公有牲口原价未动，群英社仍按原来公有时候的价格归大社公有。新成立的两个新社的牲口因为按冬季牲口市价折价归社要吃亏20％到30％，经社员公议，按现在市价提高20％折价。这样做，虽然畜主还稍吃一点亏，但是因为老社有公共积累，新社员同样可以享受，也就没有意见了。
    社员土地的评产问题：原来各社土地评产大体合理、各社之间悬殊也不大的，一般不变。个别评产不合理的地块，适当调整。原来土地评产问题较多的或变化较大的，就进行比较详细的评议。土地、劳力分益比例，有的通过合并，适当降低了土地报酬。
    并社中还有一个较大的问题是安排各社干部的问题。对于原来各社的干部，要本着有利于团结的原则，经过社员酝酿和民主讨论，审慎地、恰当地进行配备和安排。从以上四个村的情况看，一般是把那些原来公道能干，积极办社的主要骨干，选到了大社的领导岗位上去了。没有被选为大社主要干部的，一般都当了生产队长，对他们进行了耐心的解释教育工作，使他们仍然积极热情地参加社里的各种工作。在配备社干部中，对领导成份也作了慎重的调整，树立了贫农、下中农的领导优势。
