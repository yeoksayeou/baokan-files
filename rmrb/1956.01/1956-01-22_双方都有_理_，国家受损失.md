Both Sides Have "Reason," The State Suffers Losses
To the Editor:

In May 1955, the Machinery Supply Station of the Central South Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering signed a contract with the Tianjin Fifth Machine Factory to order 9 mud mixers. The contract clearly stipulated the unit price of the machines and the delivery date. By July and August, the machines were produced, but the Machinery Supply Station refused to pay and demanded a return of the goods. The factory disagreed. So the two sides engaged in telegrams and official documents, back and forth, a war of words that has continued incessantly.

It turned out that the Central South Machinery Supply Station originally wrote to the Tianjin Fifth Machine Factory requesting to order "mortar mixers," but the factory mistakenly wrote "mud mixers" in the contract. The performance of these two types of mixers is basically the same, except that the latter has an automatic feeding and water supply device, and the unit price is higher. The Machinery Supply Station did not carefully look at the name and unit price of the goods written on the contract, and signed and stamped it in a muddle-headed way. Later, the superior authority, the Central South Engineering Management Bureau, discovered this problem, and the Machinery Supply Station wrote to inquire about the name and use of the machines; the factory did not reply. When the machines were manufactured, the dispute began. The Machinery Supply Station proposed that "the products should meet the requirements of the order"; the factory insisted that "we must act in accordance with the contract." In this way, "each side has its own reason," and the "buck-passing" has continued until now.

These 9 machines, worth more than 60,000 yuan, have been piled up in the warehouse until now amid the dispute between the two sides, reducing the state's machine shift fee income by more than 16,000 yuan, and failing to unleash the production capacity of 20,000 cubic meters of mud. This is a loss to the country's construction, but neither side in the dispute has thought about it.

### 双方都有“理”，国家受损失

    双方都有“理”，国家受损失编辑同志：
    1955年5月间，建筑工程部中南工程管理总局机具供应总站同天津第五机器厂签订了一项订购9台泥浆搅拌机的订货合同，上面明确地规定了机器的单价和交货日期。到7、8月间，机器生产出来了，机具总站却拒绝付款，要求退货。厂方不同意。于是双方就电报公文，你来我往，笔墨官司，打个不休。
    原来，中南机具总站当初写信给天津第五机器厂要求订购的是“灰浆搅拌机”，可是厂方在合同里却错写成了“泥浆搅拌机”。这两种搅拌机的性能基本上相同，只是后者多一个自动加料和给水设备，单价较高。机具总站对合同上所写的货名、单价都没有仔细看，就稀里胡涂地签了名、盖了章。后来上级机关中南工程管理总局发现了这个问题，机具总站才写信问一下机器的名称和用途；厂方也没有复信。等到机器出厂，争执就开始了。机具总站提出“产品应该合乎订货的要求”；厂方却坚持“必须按合同办事”。这样，“公说公有理，婆说婆有理”，就一直“扯皮”到现在。
    这9台共值6万多元的机器，在双方的争执声中直到现在还积压在仓库里，使国家减少了机器台班费的收入16，000元以上，使两万立方公尺的泥浆生产能力没有发挥。这是国家建设所受到的损失，但是争执的双方都没有去想它。　林林
