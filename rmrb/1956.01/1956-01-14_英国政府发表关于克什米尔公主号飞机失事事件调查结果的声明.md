Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: The British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Mr. Humphrey Arthur Oxenhame, delivered to the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Zhang Hanfu, on January 11th, a copy of the British government's statement issued on January 11th regarding the investigation results of the "Kashmir Princess" plane crash. The full text of the statement is as follows:

After the Indian Airlines plane "Kashmir Princess" crashed on April 11, 1955, during its flight from Hong Kong to Jakarta, and after claims that the plane crash was a direct result of sabotage, the Hong Kong government conducted a thorough investigation.

During these investigations, the prior whereabouts of 71 individuals who had contact with providing services to the plane during its just over one-hour stay in Hong Kong were questioned and investigated.

The investigation committee established by the Indonesian government, after examining the wreckage of the aircraft, confirmed on May 12 that the crash was caused by the explosion of a time bomb placed in the rear outer wing angle of the aircraft's right wing wheel bay.

Of the 27 people whose activities were investigated because they had been near the right wing of the plane while working, one was Chow Tze-ming, alias Zhou Ju, an employee of Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company. He was not directly suspected until May 18. When his address was searched that day, he was not found. Later, information was received that he had secretly boarded a Civil Air Transport aircraft and arrived in Taipei, Formosa, on the same day, a few hours before this investigation began.

During the subsequent police investigation of people who had contact with Zhou Tze-ming before he went to Formosa, evidence was found indicating that he may have been bribed by someone connected with a Kuomintang intelligence organization and promised a reward. There was also evidence showing that after the plane crash, he admitted on four different occasions that he had participated in the crime. It is alleged that what he said on each occasion had minor differences in detail, but overall they were completely consistent with each other and all indicated his admission that:

	(1) He sabotaged the plane;
	(2) He had been promised a reward of HK$600,000;
	(3) He used a small time bomb that made very little noise;
	(4) He planned to secretly board a plane to Formosa.

In addition, there was evidence showing that Zhou Tze-ming spent several hundred Hong Kong dollars shortly before and after the plane crash, before he went to Formosa, an amount far exceeding his normal income.

Accordingly, the Hong Kong police authorities obtained an arrest warrant for the person on September 3, charging him with conspiracy to murder.

After the warrant was issued, the Kuomintang authorities in Formosa were requested to return the person for trial. After repeated reminders, the Kuomintang authorities notified Her Majesty's Consul in Tamsui on December 14 that the relevant authorities were unable to handle the matter because there was no legal basis for the request.

When requesting the Kuomintang authorities to hand over Zhou Tze-ming for trial, Her Majesty's Government could not make a request based on legal grounds because there was no extradition treaty. However, Her Majesty's Government pointed out to the Kuomintang authorities that it was in their own interest to clarify and close this outrageous crime. Her Majesty's Government assured the Kuomintang authorities that Zhou Tze-ming would receive a fair trial, strictly in accordance with Hong Kong law, and that he would be given every opportunity to present his defense.

Despite thorough and continuous investigations, it has not been possible to bring charges against any other individual who may have been involved in the crime.

Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: London, British Radio, January 12th, commented on the statement issued by the British Colonial Office on the 11th regarding the destruction of the "Kashmir Princess" plane by Chiang Kai-shek's agents, saying, "World opinion does not sympathize with the Taiwan authorities' unwillingness to cooperate in clarifying the responsibility for this heinous crime, and the act of not returning the accused person to Hong Kong for trial after a fair and thorough investigation. The Hong Kong authorities are still continuing to investigate other people who participated in the secret sabotage of the plane."

    英国政府发表关于克什米尔公主号飞机失事事件调查结果的声明
    新华社13日讯  英国驻中华人民共和国代办欧念儒在1月11日将英国政府在1月11日发表的关于“克什米尔公主号”飞机失事事件调查结果的声明一件送交中华人民共和国外交部副部长章汉夫。声明全文如下：
    在印度航空公司飞机“克什米尔公主号”1955年4月11日从香港赴雅加达的航行中失了事，并且有人声称这次的飞机坠毁事件是破坏行为的直接后果以后，香港政府进行了深入的调查。
    在这些调查中，讯问和调查了当飞机停留在香港的一小时多一点的期间内，曾同对这架飞机提供服务发生关系的71个人的事前行踪。
    由印度尼西亚政府设立的调查委员会在检查了飞机的残骸之后，于5月12日确立了坠毁事件是由于放在飞机右翼轮舱后外翼角处的一个定时炸弹的爆炸所造成。
    当时由于工作曾到过飞机右翼附近，因此他们的活动受到调查的27个人中，有一个是周梓铭，化名周驹，他是香港航空工程公司的雇员。直到5月18日才直接怀疑到他。那天到他的地址去调查时却没有找到他，而以后得到情报说，在这一调查进行前几小时，他已偷乘民航运输公司飞机在同天到达福摩萨台北。
    在其后对周梓铭去福摩萨以前同他有来往的人进行警察调查的过程中，发现有证据说明，他可能曾被同一个国民党情报组织有关系的人所收买，并且许给他一笔报酬。同时还有证据说明，在飞机坠毁以后，他曾在四次不同的场合下，承认过他曾参与这件罪行；据称他在每个场合中所说的话在细节方面有微小的出入，但是从总的方面说来却是完全互相吻合的，并且都说明他承认：
    （一）他破坏了飞机；
    （二）他曾得到许诺，可以获得60万港币的报酬；
    （三）他用了一枚发声极轻微的小的定时炸弹；
    （四）他打算偷乘飞机赴福摩萨。
    此外有证据说明，在飞机坠毁前不久和以后周梓铭去福摩萨以前，他曾用去几百元港币，而这个数目是远超过他的正常收入的。
    据此，香港警察当局于9月3日获得了逮捕该人的拘票，对他的指控是阴谋杀人。
    拘票一发出后，就要求在福摩萨的国民党当局将该人送回受审。经一再提醒后，国民党当局于12月14日通知女王陛下驻淡水的领事说，有关当局无法处理这件事，因为这一要求没有法律根据。
    在要求国民党当局把周梓铭交出受审的时候，由于不存在引渡条约，女王陛下政府不能依据法律根据而提出要求。但是，女王陛下政府向国民党当局指出，把这一狂暴的罪行查明结案，是对他们本身有好处的。女王陛下政府向国民党当局保证，周梓铭一定会受到公正的严格按照香港法律的审判，并且他将得到一切机会来提出他的辩护。
    尽管作了深入的和连续不断的调查，但是至今还不可能对可能曾参与这个罪行的任何其他个人提出控告。
    新华社13日讯  伦敦英国电台1月12日评论英国殖民部11日发表的关于“克什米尔公主号”飞机被蒋介石特务破坏失事的声明说，“世界舆论并不同情台湾当局不愿意合作查明这一件可恶罪行的责任，和不把经过公正和彻底调查以后被控的人送回香港受审的这种行为。香港当局现在仍然在继续侦察其他曾经参加暗中破坏这架飞机的人”。
