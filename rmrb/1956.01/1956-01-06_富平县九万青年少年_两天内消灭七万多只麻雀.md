    Fuping County's 90,000 Young People and Children
    Eliminate Over 70,000 Sparrows in Two Days
    In Shaanxi Province, Fuping County, 90,000 young people and children have eliminated more than 77,000 sparrows in the past two days. They formed shock brigades, setting up sieves and traps at home during the day to catch sparrows; in the evening, they paid attention to where the sparrows roosted, and as soon as it got dark, they set up ladders, climbed under the eaves to dig out sparrows, and sealed sparrow nests with mud.
    The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League has called on the province's five million young people and children to launch a "Sparrow Elimination Movement Month," demanding that all sparrows in the province be completely eliminated in 1956. (Xinhua News Agency)

    富平县九万青年少年
    两天内消灭七万多只麻雀
    陕西省富平县有九万个青年和少年在最近两天内消灭了77，000多只麻雀。他们组成突击队，白天在家里支筛子、摆枷笼，捕捉麻雀；傍晚就注意麻雀宿在那里，天一黑就搭起梯子，爬到房檐下掏麻雀，泥封麻雀窝。
    青年团陕西省委员会已经号召全省五百万青年和少年开展一个“消灭麻雀运动月”，要求在1956年内把全省的麻雀全部消灭。　（新华社）
