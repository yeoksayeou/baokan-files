The State Council Instruction on Further Improving the Work of Streamlining State Organs

Since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council decided to streamline state organs this spring, the streamlining work of state organs has been carried out first in the central and Beijing municipal organs, and has achieved significant results. The provincial, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality level organs are either in progress or preparing to proceed. In order to further improve this work, the following instructions are hereby made:

I. Streamlining state organs is an important national policy, a necessary means to practice thrift and accumulate construction funds, and a powerful measure to improve the work of state organs and ensure the victorious advance of socialist construction. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have made great achievements in the construction of state organs and the improvement of the work of state organs. However, there are still some unreasonable phenomena in the organizational forms and staffing of state organs. According to the streamlining work of central organs and reports from various localities, the main problems are: overlapping institutions, large establishments, overstaffing, and low work efficiency in upper-level leading organs, while grassroots organizations generally lack backbones and have weak leadership; in institutions and enterprises, administrative management organs are large, and there are too many non-business or non-production personnel. These unreasonable phenomena must be changed promptly and resolutely in order to adapt to the increasingly heavy and complex tasks of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Therefore, all levels of state organs and various institutions and enterprises must, in accordance with the principle of "streamlining institutions, tightening establishments, and adjusting cadres," conduct streamlining earnestly, thoroughly, and realistically. According to the requirements of "overall planning and strengthening leadership," those that should be reduced more should be reduced more, those that should be reduced less should be reduced less, and those that should be increased should be increased appropriately, so as to achieve the purpose of reducing administrative establishments, saving administrative expenses, rationally using manpower, further overcoming bureaucracy, improving the work of state organs, and ensuring the completion of socialist construction and socialist transformation tasks.

II. In order to implement the national streamlining policy, all provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities should, under the requirements of overall planning and strengthening leadership, comprehensively check and study the institutions and establishments of local state organs at all levels according to the principle of tightening the upper level and enriching the grassroots and production and construction units, and make a streamlining plan for the whole province, autonomous region, or directly administered municipality. The organs of provinces, autonomous regions, directly administered municipalities, and province-administered cities must be vigorously streamlined. The commissioner's offices and district offices are dispatch agencies of the higher-level people's committees and should be greatly tightened. The small district and small township system can no longer adapt to the new situation after the rapid development of the agricultural collectivization movement, and the administrative regions of districts and townships should be gradually adjusted. The organization and establishment of counties and county-administered districts shall be formulated by the county people's committee according to the actual situation, and submitted to the provincial and autonomous region people's committee for examination and approval before implementation on a trial basis.

Institutions and enterprises should, in accordance with the requirements of increasing production, practicing thrift, implementing economic accounting, and improving management level, gradually implement the establishment and staffing system, vigorously streamline administrative management organs, and reduce non-production personnel and non-business personnel. The streamlining work of institutions and enterprises shall be the responsibility of the central competent departments and the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities respectively.

III. Streamlining work should first be combined with inspection work, summarizing experience, defining the scope of business, clarifying work responsibilities and work relationships, and then reasonably determine the institutions and staff according to business needs. In streamlining institutions, it is necessary to resolutely cut and merge overlapping, similar in nature, and dispensable institutions, and strengthen and establish urgently needed institutions. Organizational levels should be reduced as much as possible. In principle, the central organs shall implement a three-level system, and the departments (bureaus) of provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities shall, in principle, implement a two-level system.

The affiliated institutions of state organs (such as guesthouses, sanatoriums, nursing homes, printing houses, nurseries, etc.) should be vigorously rectified, those that should be merged should be merged, and those that should be abolished should be abolished. Those that continue to exist should be separated from the administrative establishment and changed into institutions or enterprises, and should be streamlined seriously.

In streamlining, personnel who do not have much work in the organs, are improperly used, need to study and train, and need to be tempered at the lower level must be adjusted as much as possible; the administrative staff and service personnel (handymen) in state organs, and the non-business personnel and non-production personnel in institutions and enterprises must be reduced to the minimum.

In streamlining, the phenomenon of unclear and mutually occupied administrative, institutional, and enterprise establishments should be studied and clearly distinguished.

The streamlining work must be the responsibility of the top leaders, who must personally take action and adopt a method combining leadership and the masses. It is necessary to be good at relying on the wisdom and strength of the masses. It is necessary to open up the minds of cadres, especially leading cadres at all levels, adopt a resolute attitude, and overcome various passive resistance and conservative ideas. Only in this way can we implement the central streamlining policy and formulate an establishment plan that can both meet the needs of work and comply with the streamlining principles.

IV. The work of cadre adjustment and personnel handling is an important link in implementing the central streamlining policy and successfully completing the streamlining task, and must be guaranteed to be done well. For the adjusted personnel, they must be used reasonably and properly arranged. A large number of personnel should be transferred to strengthen lower-level institutions, grassroots production and construction units, and newly established work departments. Those who need to study and train should be given the opportunity to study and train as much as possible, and those who need to retire or resign should be handled according to the retirement and resignation procedures respectively.

In adjusting cadres, we must proceed from the overall interests of the country, oppose the one-sided localist thinking of "removing the weak and keeping the strong," and oppose the bad phenomenon of backlog of cadres and waste of national talents. In handling personnel, we must adopt a serious and responsible attitude to prevent the errors of being simple and hasty and pushing things out. It is necessary to educate state organ staff and employees of institutions and enterprises so that they understand the great significance of streamlining work for the country's construction of socialist undertakings, so as to consciously obey the country's unified deployment. Difficulties of transferred and resigned personnel should be properly resolved.

V. Streamlining work must be closely combined with improving leadership style and improving working methods. We must strengthen the planning and organization in our work, implement the system of division of labor and responsibility under collective leadership; we must reduce unnecessary official documents, reports, and meetings, and simplify handling procedures; we must overcome the bureaucratic style of not conducting investigations and research, not inspecting work, not going deep into reality, and not approaching the masses; we must criticize the conservative thinking of sticking to conventions, improve backward and outdated working methods; at the same time, we must establish and improve corresponding working systems, strengthen work discipline, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of staff, and improve work efficiency to ensure the completion of administrative tasks and consolidate streamlining results.

VI. In the past, due to the lack of strict management and supervision of establishment work and personnel work, some state organs and institutions and enterprises blindly added institutions, expanded establishments, and even arbitrarily recruited personnel. This disorganized and undisciplined phenomenon must be overcome and corrected. In streamlining work, it is necessary to strictly establish a management and supervision system for the establishment of state organs, and effectively improve personnel work. The establishment of state organs and the staffing of personnel must be reported to the competent authority for approval; the appointment of personnel by state organs must be subject to review and approval by the personnel department; the addition of employees by institutions and enterprises must be reported to the higher-level leading authority for approval, and be subject to unified allocation by the labor department. All erroneous acts of arbitrarily adding institutions, expanding establishments, increasing employees, and appointing private individuals are strictly prohibited. Violators shall be held accountable and given sanctions depending on the circumstances.

VII. Streamlining work can generally be carried out in the order of state organs first, followed by institutions and enterprises. The streamlining of central state organs should be completed by the end of January 1956, and the streamlining of state organs at all levels in local areas should be completed by the end of February 1956. The streamlining of institutions and enterprises shall be arranged by the competent departments in a unified manner according to the actual situation, and carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner.

Central organs, provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities should strengthen the leadership of streamlining work. The streamlining plans and staffing plans of state organs at all levels under the jurisdiction of provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities, and the streamlining plans of institutions and enterprises under the jurisdiction of central organs should be submitted to the State Council for review. The streamlining plans of institutions and enterprises under the jurisdiction of provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities should be submitted to the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities for review.

　　国务院关于进一步做好国家机关精简工作的指示
    从今年春季中共中央和国务院决定精简国家机关以来，国家机关的精简工作，首先在中央一级和北京市机关中开展，并且已经获得了显著的成效。省、自治区、直辖市一级机关，有的正在进行，有的正在准备进行。为了进一步做好这一工作，特作如下指示：
    一、国家机关的精简，是国家的一项重要政策，是厉行节约、积累建设资金的必要手段，也是改进国家机关工作、保证社会主义建设胜利前进的有力措施。中华人民共和国成立以来，我们在国家机关的建设和国家机关工作的改进上，是有巨大成绩的。但是在国家机关的组织形式和人员配备方面，还存在着一些不合理现象。根据中央一级机关精简工作和各地报告，主要问题是：上层领导机关机构重叠、编制庞大、人浮于事、工作效率不高，而基层组织则又一般是骨干缺乏、领导力量薄弱；在事业、企业单位中是行政管理机构庞大，非业务人员或非生产人员过多。这些不合理的现象，必须及时地坚决地加以改变，才能适应日益繁重复杂的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的任务。因此，各级国家机关和各种事业、企业单位，都必须本着“精简机构、紧缩编制、调整干部”的方针，认真地、彻底地、实事求是地进行精简，根据“全面规划，加强领导”的要求，该多减的多减，该少减的少减，该增加的适当增加，达到缩减行政编制，节省行政经费，合理使用人力，进一步克服官僚主义，改进国家机关工作，保证完成社会主义建设和社会主义改造任务的目的。
    二、为了贯彻国家的精简政策，各省、自治区、直辖市都应当在全面规划、加强领导的要求下，根据紧缩上层、充实基层和生产建设单位的原则，对各级地方国家机关的机构和编制加以全面的检查研究，作出全省、全区、全市的精简计划。省、自治区、直辖市、省辖市的机关，必须大力精简，专员公署和区公所都是上级人民委员会的派出机构，更应当大大的紧缩。小区小乡制已经不能适应农业合作化运动迅速发展后的新形势，区、乡的行政区域，应当逐渐调整。县和县属区的组织和编制，由县人民委员会根据实际情况订出方案，报请省、自治区人民委员会审查批准后试行。
    事业、企业单位，应当根据增加生产，厉行节约，贯彻经济核算，提高管理水平的要求，逐步地实行编制定员制度，大力精简行政管理机构，缩减非生产人员和非业务人员。事业、企业单位的精简工作，由中央各主管部门和省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会分别负责。
    三、精简工作应当首先结合检查工作，总结经验，划清业务范围，明确工作职责和工作关系，然后按照业务需要，合理地确定机构，编定人员。在精简机构中，要坚决裁并重叠的、性质相近的、可有可无的机构，加强和建立急需加强和建立的机构。要尽量减少组织层次。中央各机关原则上实行三级制，省、自治区、直辖市各厅（局）原则上实行两级制。
    国家机关的附属机构（如招待所、休养所、疗养所、印刷所、托儿所等），要大力整顿，该合并的合并，该取消的取消，继续存在的，都应当从行政编制中划分出来，分别改为事业或者企业单位，并且认真地进行精简。
    在精简中，必须把机关中事情不多，使用不当，需要学习训练和需要到下层锻炼的人员，尽量调整出来；必须把国家机关中的行政事务人员和服务人员（勤杂人员），事业、企业单位中的非业务人员、非生产人员，减少到最低限度。
    在精简中，对行政、事业、企业编制混淆不清和互相挤占的现象加以研究，划分清楚。
    精简工作必须首长负责，亲自动手，采取领导与群众相结合的方式进行。要善于依靠群众的智慧和力量。要打通干部特别是各级领导干部的思想，采取坚决的态度，克服各种消极抵触情绪和保守思想。只有这样，才能贯彻中央的精简方针，订出既能适应工作需要又符合精简原则的编制方案。
    四、干部调整和人员处理工作，是贯彻中央精简方针、顺利完成精简任务的重要环节，要切实保证做好。对于调整出来的人员，必须做到合理使用，妥善安置。大量的人员应调去加强下层机构、基层生产建设单位和新建立的工作部门。需要学习训练的尽可能地给予学习、受训的机会，需要退休、退职的分别按照退休、退职办法处理。
    在调整干部时，必须从国家整体利益出发，反对片面的“去弱留强”的本位主义思想，反对积压干部、浪费国家人材的不良现象。在处理人员时，必须采取严肃负责的态度，防止简单草率、推出了事的错误作法。要教育国家机关工作人员和事业、企业单位的职工，使他们认识精简工作对于国家建设社会主义事业的重大意义，从而自觉的服从国家的统一调动。对调职、离职人员的困难，应当予以适当的解决。
    五、精简工作，必须同改善领导作风和改进工作方法密切结合起来。要加强工作中的计划性和组织性，贯彻集体领导下的分工负责制度；要减少不必要的公文、报表、会议，简化办事手续，要克服不调查研究、不检查工作、不深入实际、不接近群众的官僚主义作风；要批判墨守成规的保守思想，改进落后陈旧的工作方法；同时，还要建立和健全相应的工作制度，加强工作纪律，发挥工作人员的积极性、创造性，提高工作效率，以保证完成行政任务，巩固精简成果。
    六、过去由于对编制工作和人事工作缺乏严格的管理和监督，以致有些国家机关和事业、企业单位盲目增设机构，扩大编制，甚至任意招收人员。这种无组织无纪律的现象，必须加以克服和纠正。在精简工作中，要严格建立国家机关编制的管理和监督制度，切实健全人事工作。国家机关的机构设置与人员编制必须报经主管机关批准；国家机关任用人员必须经过人事部门审查批准；事业、企业单位增加员工必须报请上级领导机关批准，并由劳动部门统筹调配。严禁一切任意增设机构、扩大编制、增加员工和任用私人的错误行为。违反者，应追究责任，并视情节轻重，给予处分。
    七、精简工作一般可按先国家机关后事业、企业单位的步骤进行。中央一级国家机关的精简要在1956年1月底结束，各级地方国家机关的精简要在1956年2月底结束。事业、企业单位的精简由各主管部门根据实际情况统一安排，有计划地有步骤地抓紧进行。
    中央各机关、各省、自治区、直辖市应加强精简工作的领导。各省、自治区、直辖市所属各级国家机关的精简计划和人员编制方案，中央各机关所属事业、企业单位的精简计划，都应报送国务院审核。各省、自治区、直辖市所属事业、企业单位的精简计划应报送各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会审核。
