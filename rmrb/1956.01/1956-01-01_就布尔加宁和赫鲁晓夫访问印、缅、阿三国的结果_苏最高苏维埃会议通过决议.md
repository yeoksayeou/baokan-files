Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 30th (TASS dispatch): The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed a resolution on December 29 regarding the results of the visit of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and the member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, to India, Burma, and Afghanistan. The resolution pointed out that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union expresses complete satisfaction with the results of Comrade Bulganin and Comrade Khrushchev's visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan. The friendly visit of the Soviet state leaders to these countries has become an event of great political significance, which helps to strengthen peace in Asia and the Far East and further ease tensions in international relations.

The resolution said that the warm reception given to the Soviet state leaders in India, Burma, and Afghanistan is a manifestation of the deep respect and friendship of the people of these countries towards the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. This visit has greatly strengthened the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the great India, Burma, and Afghanistan in the struggle for peace, the elimination of the "Cold War," and the further easing of international tensions. The agreement of our countries on the fundamental issues of international life—the maintenance and strengthening of peace—has been reaffirmed. This identity of views between the Soviet Union, India, Burma, and Afghanistan is not due to temporary reasons, but because of the same fundamental interests of these countries which desire peace and security for all peoples.

During the negotiations, a consensus was reached on major issues in our relations with these countries and on the most important international issues, including disarmament and the unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, satisfying the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China to the coastal islands and Taiwan, granting the People's Republic of China its legitimate seat in the United Nations, and resolving other outstanding issues in Asia and the Far East in accordance with the legitimate rights of the people. The consensus that peace can only be guaranteed through the collective efforts of all countries is of great significance.

The resolution then pointed out that the principle of peaceful coexistence, which serves as the basis for mutual relations between the Soviet Union and these countries, is gaining wider international recognition.

The resolution subsequently pointed out that another major result of Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Asian countries was the conclusion of agreements with these countries on expanding trade, economic, cultural, and other ties on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and without imposing any obligations of a political or military nature. Contacts and cooperation between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, and Afghanistan in all aspects of political, economic, social, and cultural activities will develop smoothly, and measures will be taken to enable the people of all countries to increase their understanding of each other's lives, achievements, and cultures, and to expand the exchange of experiences between them.

The resolution said that the visit of Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev to India, Burma, and Afghanistan has received a tremendous and positive response in many countries, especially among the people of colonial and dependent countries, and is welcomed by all those who are sincerely concerned about eliminating the threat of war and consolidating lasting peace.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union believes that this visit of Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev demonstrates that personal contact between state leaders is of great significance for mutual understanding, for building trust between countries, and for developing international cooperation. This visit will help weaken the forces of war advocates and will help consolidate world peace.

The resolution concluded by stating that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decides to approve the activities of Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev during their visit to the Republic of India, the Union of Burma, and Afghanistan, considering their activities to be fully in line with the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and conducive to the cause of consolidating peace and the friendship and cooperation of all peoples.
