　　Peking Opera in Northern Europe
　　Shuai Peng
　　The China Classical Opera and Dance Troupe recently visited five Northern European countries: Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. The most significant result of this visit is that it not only enabled people from all walks of life in the Nordic countries to understand China's excellent cultural traditions, but also promoted the Nordic people's understanding and friendship towards New China. This friendship, in the words of Rossinkranz, director of the Icelandic National Theatre, "will not be severed no matter what happens in this eventful world."
　　The troupe's visit introduced the traditional Peking Opera, beloved by the Chinese people, to the Nordic public for the first time in history. "The song and dance drama from New China is here!" This became a major event in their cultural life. Whether in Helsinki, Stockholm, Oslo, Copenhagen, or Reykjavik, as soon as Peking Opera met the audience, it immediately caused a sensation in the entire city and even the whole country. Newspapers used a new term to describe the people's great interest in Peking Opera: "China fever." During the visit to Finland, people in Helsinki told us that the topics of conversation at the time revolved around President Paasikivi's visit to the Soviet Union and the Peking Opera performances. In Sweden, people in Stockholm streets and trams talked about Peking Opera in groups. In Norway, the Oslo newspapers used headlines like "Chinese Capture Oslo." In Denmark, people said that there had not been such a grand occasion in the theatrical life for more than 30 years, and tickets for four days were sold out in a few hours. Many theaters in Northern Europe made an exception to sell standing tickets to meet the audience's demands. At the entrance of the Copenhagen Theatre, some people even held up small flags to petition, which read: "I want two tickets." It is no exaggeration to say that everyone in the Nordic countries hoped to have the opportunity to appreciate Peking Opera, but unfortunately, the troupe's stay in each place was limited.
　　Inside the theaters where the troupe performed, the audience's enthusiastic applause, stomping, and cheers were said to be unprecedented by many local theater professionals. When the troupe performed at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, an old gentleman was sitting in front of me. He was so happy while watching the show that he kept gesticulating, and finally simply stood on the chair and waved his handkerchief to the actors enthusiastically. When leaving the theater, I said to the old gentleman: "You are the most enthusiastic audience member." His wife, who was walking next to him, interrupted before he could speak and said, "I am the most enthusiastic!"
　　So, what exactly in the art of Peking Opera so deeply touched the Nordic audience? Were they curious? Or was it just because they saw the thrilling martial arts that, in their words, made "the law of gravity lose its effect"? Here, it may be more appropriate to answer this question with the comments of the Nordic newspapers. "Gothenburg Commercial Shipping News" said: "This fascinating art unfolds before you like a flower of artistic perfection, and brings you infinite joy through your soul. This great art, you cannot help but fall in love with it." The popularity, realism, comprehensive artistic characteristics, rich imagination, poetry, and healthy humor of Peking Opera, which has been vividly promoted by New China, have won the highest praise from Nordic public opinion. How can one blame the Nordic audience for applauding and cheering like crazy for "Autumn River," which is as beautiful as a pastoral poem, as full of life's humor, and so realistically depicts the turbulence on the water without any props? How can one blame the Nordic dramatists for saying that they were willing to unconditionally fall in front of these unfamiliar Chinese?
　　What the Nordic people saw from the troupe's visit was far more than its attractive art. They saw from the troupe's performances that New China had given new vitality to its ancient culture, and they were deeply moved by New China's concern for cultural undertakings. For example, the Swedish "Expressen" said: "Chinese drama is an element of culture - not for doing business. And the theater here mainly serves the latter. Therefore, the young people in the Chinese theater circle receive very good training." When Chinese artists talked to some theater professionals in those countries about the changes in their social status and working conditions before and after liberation, some were even moved to tears.
　　Many people in the Nordic countries originally lacked understanding of China. Some people did not even recognize the Chinese national flag. In Norway, a person of status in the cultural circles was even surprised and expressed disbelief when he heard that Ibsen's works were circulating in China. However, the cultural exchange through the troupe's visit greatly increased the understanding between China and the distant Nordic people, and shortened the distance between each other. People called the troupe cultural envoys sent by the Chinese people, and regarded it as a hand of friendship extended to them by the Chinese people. During the short period of the troupe's visit to various places in Northern Europe, many Nordic cultural and artistic figures became friends of China. When the troupe ended its performance in Kuopio, central Finland, the local actors saw them off at the station late at night. Actress Maarkanen hugged the Chinese actress Yun Yanming with endless reluctance and said: "I love you, truly love you, I would like to go to China with you, how wonderful that would be!" Indeed, through the troupe's visit, China, Beijing, has become a place desired by many people in Northern Europe. They are eager to further understand New China. They regard being able to visit Beijing one day as their most beautiful wish.
　　The warm welcome from people from all walks of life in the Nordic countries to the China Classical Opera and Dance Troupe once again vividly proves that developing international cultural exchanges is in line with the wishes of the people of all countries and is conducive to international cooperation and the cause of peace. Government officials from the Nordic countries also generally welcomed the Chinese troupe's visit. Responsible persons from the governments of Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark believe that the troupe's visit has increased the understanding between China and the people of their countries, and expressed the hope that this cultural connection will continue to be maintained and strengthened. Icelandic President Ásgeir Ásgeirsson, when receiving the head of the troupe, Chu Tunan, hoped that the troupe would bring the Icelandic people's greetings to the Chinese people, and the desire for China's peace and prosperity to the Chinese people. He asked how the word "peace" is said in Chinese, hoping that this would be the beginning of his learning Chinese.
　　The China Classical Opera and Dance Troupe has now completed its Nordic visit and returned to China. Its work for the cause of cultural exchange and friendship between the people of all countries will always be remembered in the hearts of the Nordic people. The troupe's artists regard the honor they received in Northern Europe as the honor of the people of their motherland, and the honor of the excellent cultural traditions of their motherland. They have been greatly encouraged by this visit, further increasing their love for the motherland, for the traditions of national art, and their confidence in defending peace.

　　京戏在北欧
    帅鹏
    中国古典歌舞剧团最近访问了北欧五个国家：芬兰、瑞典、挪威、丹麦和冰岛。这次访问的最有意义的结果是它不仅使北欧国家的各阶层人士认识了中国优秀的文化传统，而且促进了北欧人民对新中国的了解和友谊。这种友谊，用冰岛国家剧院院长罗辛克朗兹的话来说，“是不论这个多事的世界上发生什么事情都不会断绝的”。
    剧团的访问有史以来第一次把中国人民所喜爱的传统的京戏介绍到北欧的公众面前。“新中国的歌舞剧来了！”这在他们的文化生活上成为一件大事。无论在赫尔辛基、在斯德哥尔摩、奥斯陆、哥本哈根、或是在雷克雅未克，只要京戏和观众一见面，它立刻就轰动了全城以至全国。报纸上用了一个新的辞汇来形容人民对于京剧的巨大兴趣：“中国热”。在访问芬兰的时候，据赫尔辛基人士告诉我们，当时人们的话题都围绕着巴锡基维总统访问苏联和京戏演出这两件事情。在瑞典，斯德哥尔摩街头巷尾和电车上三三两两地谈论着京戏。在挪威，奥斯陆报纸用了“中国人俘掳了奥斯陆”这样的标题。在丹麦，人们说30多年来戏剧生活中不曾有过这样的盛况，四天的票几个钟头就卖光了。北欧许多剧院为了满足观众的要求，破例出售了站票。在哥本哈根剧院门口，甚至有人举着小旗请愿，上面写着：“我要两张票”。可以毫不夸张地说，北欧各国人人都希望得到欣赏京戏的机会，可惜的是剧团在各地逗留的时间毕竟是有限的。
    在剧团演出的剧院里面，观众那种鼓掌、蹬地板、欢呼的热烈情况，据很多地方的戏剧界人士说是空前的。剧团在哥本哈根皇家剧院演出的时候，我的前面坐着一位老先生，他在观剧时高兴得不断地手舞足蹈，最后索性站在椅子上手里挥动着手绢向演员们热烈欢呼。在走出剧场的时候，我向这位老先生说：“你是观众中最热情的一个。”走在他旁边的他的妻子不等他说话就抢着回答说：“我才是最热情的哩！”
    那末，究竟是京戏艺术里的什么东西这样深深地打动了北欧的观众呢？是他们好奇吗？或者，仅仅是由于看到了那种在他们说来使“重心定律失去了作用”的动人心魄的武功吗？这里，用北欧报纸的评论来回答这个问题也许更合适些。“哥德堡商业航运报”说：“这种迷人的艺术在你面前像艺术完美之花那样地展开着，并通过你的灵魂带给你无限的欢乐。这种伟大的艺术，你无法不在它面前倾倒。”被新中国鲜明地发扬起来的京戏的人民性，它的现实主义，它的综合艺术的特点，它的丰富的想像力、诗意和健康的幽默感，赢得了北欧舆论的最高的赞誉。像“秋江”那样田园诗一样的美丽，那样充满着生活的幽默情趣，那样不要任何道具而逼真地表现出水上的颠簸，怎能怪北欧的观众如醉如狂地鼓掌欢呼，又怎能怪北欧的戏剧家说他们情愿无条件地倾倒在这些陌生的中国人面前呢。
    北欧的人民从剧团的访问中看到的远远不限于它的引人的艺术，他们从访问团的演出中看到了新中国使自己古老的文化有了新的生命力，他们为新中国对文化事业的关怀所深深感动。例如，瑞典“快报”就说：“中国戏剧是文化的要素——而不是为了做生意。而这里的戏剧主要是为后者服务。因此中国戏剧界的青年得到非常好的训练。”当中国艺术家们同那些国家里的一些戏剧界人士谈到解放以前和以后他们社会地位和工作条件的变化的时候，有的竟感动得流泪了。
    北欧各国有不少人原来对中国是相当缺乏了解的。有些人甚至不认识中国的国旗。在挪威，一位在文化界有地位的人士听说易卜生的著作在中国流传时甚至惊讶得表示不能相信。但是，通过剧团访问所进行的文化交流大大地增进了中国和遥远的北欧人民之间的了解，缩短了彼此间的距离。人们把剧团叫作中国人民派出的文化使者，看作是中国人民向他们伸出的友谊之手。剧团在北欧各地访问的短短的时间里，不少的北欧文化艺术界人士成了中国的朋友。当剧团结束在芬兰中部库奥比欧市的演出时，当地的演员们在深夜中到车站送行，女演员玛尔卡宁带着说不尽依依不舍的神情抱着中国女演员云燕铭说：“我爱你，真正爱你，我愿意跟你们去中国，那该有多好呀！”的确，通过剧团这次访问，中国，北京，成了北欧许多人士向往的地方。他们渴望着进一步了解新中国。他们把有一天能到北京来访问作为他们最美好的愿望。
    北欧各国广泛阶层人士对中国古典歌舞剧团的热烈欢迎，再一次生动地证明了发展国际间的文化交流是符合各国人民的愿望和有利于国际合作和和平事业的。北欧各国政府人士也普遍对中国剧团的访问表示欢迎。芬兰、瑞典、挪威、丹麦的政府负责人士都认为剧团的访问增进了中国和他们国家人民之间的了解，并表示希望这种文化联系继续保持和加强。冰岛总统欧斯盖尔森在接见剧团团长楚图南时希望剧团把冰岛人民对中国人民的问候，把希望中国和平繁荣的愿望带给中国人民。他问“和平”一辞在中文是怎样讲的，希望这成为他学习中文的开端。
    中国古典歌舞剧团现在已经完成它的北欧访问回国了。它为各国人民间的文化交流和友谊事业而进行的工作将永远记忆在北欧人民的心里。剧团的艺术家们把他们在北欧获得的荣誉看作是他们祖国人民的荣誉，是他们祖国优秀的文化传统的荣誉。他们从这次访问中得到了巨大的鼓舞，进一步增加了他们对祖国、对民族艺术传统的热爱和对保卫和平的信心。
