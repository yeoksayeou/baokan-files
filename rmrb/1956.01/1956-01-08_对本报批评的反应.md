　　Reactions to the Newspaper's Criticism

　　On December 7, 1955, this newspaper published an article entitled "'Overshooting' the Plan in Three Movements," criticizing the Shenyang Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for condoning its affiliated factories' negligence of the national plan. Now, the Shenyang Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has sent a letter of self-criticism. The letter stated that they will take measures to resolutely overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, formulate this year's plan in a more advanced and proactive manner to promote improved business management in enterprises, and comprehensively plan work based on the principles of socialist industrial enterprise management, in accordance with the guidelines for public utilities.

　　On December 7, 1955, this newspaper published an article entitled "Can Inexperience Justify Irresponsibility?" criticizing the bureaucratic leadership style of Fan Zhongshan, the factory director of the Shanghai Joint State-Private New Asia Sanitary Materials Factory. Now, Comrade Fan Zhongshan has sent a letter of self-criticism and proposed four measures to correct his mistakes, including going deep into the workshops to study production issues together with technicians and workers.
