Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th: According to TASS reports from Paris: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session on the 18th. The meeting discussed the political situation and the party's tasks after the parliamentary elections. French Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Duclos delivered a report on this issue.

In his report, Duclos emphasized that the French elections on January 2 signified a definite shift to the left, signifying the victory of democratic forces. The party's entire policy and activities before the election determined the Communists' victory in the election.

Duclos said: Now, the question is not to let these victories be reduced to nothing. The tendency to turn to the left should be reflected in the government in order to ensure the implementation of a left-wing policy that conforms to the wishes of the French people.

Duclos said: The people hope to establish a truly left-wing government with the participation of the Communist Party. However, the leaders of the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party rejected the proposal made by the Central Committee of the French Communist Party to these two parties after the election to reach an agreement on implementing policies that conform to the will of the people and the interests of the country. The leaders of these two parties expressed their opposition to the establishment of a Popular Front government.

Duclos emphasized that the leaders of the "Republican Front" (the electoral alliance of the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and some small parties) want to establish a government that does not rely on a united majority. This government will inevitably be a minority government, and in some cases, it will have to seek the support of right-wing parties. Duclos said: One cannot expect a government supported by right-wing forces to implement left-wing policies.

Duclos said: It is precisely because of this that a government that directly or indirectly appeals to the support of reactionaries is doomed to failure. It is precisely because of this that we must fight to establish a left-wing government that relies on the left-wing majority of the National Assembly.

After Duclos's report, the plenary session discussed his report.

After the discussion, the meeting passed a resolution.

The resolution stated: "The working people, republicans, and patriots voted in favor of the unity of all workers and democratic forces, and in favor of a new Popular Front. They demand the formation of a left-wing government that will rely on the consensus of all left-wing forces, without exception, in the country and in parliament, and advocate satisfying the economic demands of the working class and all working strata of the people, advocate restoring the general education system, advocate combating new manifestations of fascism, resolving the Algerian issue through negotiation, and advocate pursuing a policy of disarmament, peace, and national independence."

The plenary session affirmed that in order to ensure the victory of such a government, it is necessary to strengthen the activities of the masses, establish as many Popular Front committees as possible, and strengthen the united action of the working class.

The plenary session also noted the need to consolidate the achievements that have been made through resolute organizational work in all aspects. The Central Committee urged party organizations at all levels to recruit new members, strengthen their position in industrial enterprises, and strengthen their ties with the masses, especially through the wider distribution of Communist Party newspapers.

    法共中央全会讨论政治局势和党的任务
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社巴黎消息：法国共产党中央委员会18日举行全体会议。会议讨论了议会选举后的政治局势和党的任务。法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛就这一问题作了报告。
    杜克洛在报告中强调指出，法国1月2日的选举意味着确定不移的向左转，意味着民主力量的胜利。党在选举前的全部政策和活动决定了共产党人在选举中的胜利。
    杜克洛说：现在，问题在于不让这些胜利化为乌有。向左转的倾向应当在政府中反映出来，以便保证执行符合法国人民愿望的左派政策。
    杜克洛说：人民希望建立有共产党参加的真正左派的政府。但是，社会党和激进社会党领导人拒绝了法国共产党中央委员会在选举后向这两个党提出的、就执行符合人民意志和国家利益的政策达成协议的建议，这两个党的领导人表示反对建立人民阵线的政府。
    杜克洛强调指出，“共和阵线”（社会党、激进社会党和某些小党派的选举联盟）领袖们想建立不依靠团结的多数的政府，这种政府必然地将是一个少数的政府，在某种情况下，它不得不找寻右翼党派的支持。杜克洛说：不能指望在右翼力量支持之下的政府执行左翼的政策。
    杜克洛说：正是因为这样，直接或间接向反动派呼吁支持的政府是注定要失败的。正是因为这样，必须为争取建立依靠国民议会左派多数的左派政府而斗争。
    杜克洛报告后，全体会议就他的报告进行了讨论。
    会议在讨论后通过一项决议。
    决议说：“劳动人民、共和分子和爱国人士投票赞成一切工人和民主力量的团结，赞成一个新的人民阵线。他们要求组成一个左翼政府，这个政府将依赖国内和议会里的一切毫无例外的左翼力量之间的意见一致，并且主张满足工人阶级和人民的各劳动阶层的经济要求，主张恢复普通教育制度，主张打击法西斯主义的新的表现，通过协商来解决阿尔及利亚问题，并且主张奉行一种裁军、和平和民族独立的政策。”
    全体会议确认，为了保证这样一个政府的胜利就必须加强群众的活动，尽量多地建立人民阵线委员会，并加强工人阶级的统一行动。
    全体会议还注意到了有必要通过各方面坚定的组织工作来巩固已经取得了的成就。中央委员会敦促各级党组织吸收新党员，在工业企业中加强他们的地位，特别是通过更加广泛地发行共产党报纸来加强同群众的联系。
