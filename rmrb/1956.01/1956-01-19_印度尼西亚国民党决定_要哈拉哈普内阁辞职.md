    印度尼西亚国民党决定
    要哈拉哈普内阁辞职
    新华社雅加达17日电　据安塔拉通讯社17日报道，印度尼西亚国民党执行委员会已经决定要求哈拉哈普内阁辞职。
    消息说，印度尼西亚国民党执行委员会在从1月14日到16日举行的会议上已经决定采取这样的立场：第一，哈拉哈普内阁必须交回它的委任状；第二，必须尽快地成立临时内阁，它的主要任务是组成新国会和制宪议会；第三，促进同其他党派的合作，而在担负起国家将来的责任时，绝对的条件是，内阁的成立应当根据普选的结果，并且执行在短期内保证人民的繁荣的国家计划。
    印度尼西亚国民党认为，印度尼西亚国内政治情况的恶化是哈拉哈普内阁的政策的结果，特别是由于它的外交政策，以及关于西伊里安问题、经济问题、解决空军副参谋长的任命等问题的政策。
