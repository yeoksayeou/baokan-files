What Kind of Logic is This?
    Yuan Xianlu

    A letter of self-criticism was sent to the editorial department of "People's Daily," stamped with the official seals of three units – the Cadre Section, the Supervision Office, and the Party Committee Organization Department of the Fourth Sanitary Equipment Installation Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering. Three official seals meant that three units were responsible, so this self-criticism should be serious and satisfactory. However, it was not.

    The matter began with a reader's letter in July 1955. In this letter, Zheng Zongli, a staff member of the company, criticized the unreasonable phenomena in the company's employee family hardship relief work at the end of 1954: in this relief work, the company's leaders scrambled to put the relief money into their own pockets, while those who really needed relief were forgotten. At that time, 14 of the 17 section chiefs and above in the company took away more than 55% of the actual relief funds. The masses' legitimate opinions were met with disdain in the company, so the reader wrote a letter to the newspaper's editorial department. The editorial department immediately requested the Party Committee of the Central South Engineering Management Bureau, which was managing the company on behalf of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, to handle this issue. After that, follow-up work continued for five months, and this "self-criticism" was not received until December 1955.

    The editorial department did not forward the content of that "self-criticism" to Zheng Zongli. Why? As soon as it is presented to everyone, everyone will understand. To facilitate readers' understanding, the relevant parts of Zheng Zongli's opinions and this "self-criticism" (excerpted according to the original text, only individual ungrammatical words and sentences were modified, and some connective words were added to the "opinion" part) are written in the form of a dialogue below.

    Opinion: The relief measures have been announced. Who are the relief recipients? According to the regulations: "Those with too many family members, lack of labor force, and unable to maintain the local minimum living standard," "Parents are old, siblings are young and unable to support themselves," or "Families have suffered natural disasters and man-made misfortunes and have difficulty living." However, those who formulated the regulations do not act according to the regulations, and the relief money was even given to Section Chief Zhou Shirui, who lives the most lavish life in the company. After receiving 40 yuan of relief money, he added a new woolen pants made of good material and high-quality leather shoes.

    "Self-Criticism": Comrade Zhou usually does not pay attention to thrift, which is a shortcoming. But this time it was family hardship relief money, and his family is not without difficulties... He sometimes goes to construction sites and does not eat in the workers' canteen but goes to restaurants; he has woolen clothes and silk jackets... But, can it be said that he should not be given relief? If this is the case, then it is equivalent to saying that cadres above the section chief level should not be given relief! Saying that he used the relief money to buy a pair of woolen pants and a pair of leather shoes, we learned that his relief money was sent home; he bought woolen pants and leather shoes, not with the relief money.

    Opinion: I remember there was a joke, a silly boy accepted two small coins from his mother to buy wine and vinegar. As a result, he didn't get it, because he couldn't figure out which coin to use for wine and which coin to use for vinegar. It seems that Section Chief Zhou's matter is not strange. Well, let's not talk about this. There is also a provision in the relief measures: "Each person receives a maximum of one hundred yuan." However, Manager Zhang Zhe did not let the regulations restrict his hands and feet, and he openly took away 120 yuan of relief money.

    "Self-Criticism": Manager Zhang Zhe did take 120 yuan of relief money, but 40 yuan of it was for the bedding subsidy for his two children who were to be sent to the nursery.

    Opinion: So that's how it is! Also, it is said that Deputy Manager Wang Xu's mother-in-law came here. To celebrate this "great happy event," 70 yuan was added to the relief money item.

    "Self-Criticism": Comrade Hu Yulan, wife of Deputy Manager Wang, her mother came from the Northeast to see her daughter and grandchildren, traveling thousands of miles back and forth. It is not unreasonable to give 70 yuan for relief. Family visits are the most expensive thing, and many comrades have tasted this experience!

    Opinion: "Family hardship" this word can be interpreted in many strange ways! It's just that the explanation stipulated in the relief measures has been cancelled. Please read on: Yue Weimin of the trade union, a family of four living on his salary of more than 30 yuan, and the family's house was washed away by floods not long ago; Zeng Yaohuan of the Nanchang construction site, a salary of more than 40 yuan to support seven people; civil servant Peng Xiaozhou only earns more than 20 yuan a month, with a blind father and an elderly mother at home... They did not receive a penny of relief.

    "Self-Criticism": These comrades should all be given relief, but they did not apply for it themselves, so they did not receive relief.

    Opinion: But some people did not apply for it themselves, but due to the help of "enthusiastic people," they also received relief money. Party Committee Secretary Li Yu just returned from a business trip, and one hundred yuan was placed in front of him. Director Zhao Rucai's family received a sum of money from an unknown source and strangely asked around. Probably because it would be disrespectful to refuse, they did not refuse.

    "Self-Criticism": But this money has also been approved by a responsible comrade. If you say they should not be given relief... we feel it is unreasonable.

    Opinion: I cannot understand this strange logic. Let the leading authorities make the due handling of this matter!

    "Self-Criticism": Our company has already handled it! The Party Committee discussed and inspected it several times. Manager Zhang Zhe, on behalf of the leaders, made two self-criticisms at the congress of party members, league members, and staff. Huang Jingqi, the head of the personnel section who specifically grasped the relief work, made a written self-criticism. The leaders talked to the comrades who had opinions on the relief work and admitted the shortcomings and errors in this relief work. We believe that this is considered handling it.

    Oh, this kind of "self-criticism" is considered "handling" it. The so-called "self-criticism" is just one "logic" on the left and another "logic" on the right. Their own practices, "it is not unreasonable"; other people's opinions, "it does not make sense." What a strange "logic" this is! No wonder Zheng Zongli feels incomprehensible. If you have to use the word "logic" to comment on this matter, then you can only say that some leaders of this company used private "feelings" when issuing relief money, and stubbornly argued when dealing with mass criticism.

    --Feelings cannot be denied, same to you!

### 这是什么情理

    这是什么情理
    袁先禄
    一封检讨信寄到了“人民日报”的编辑部，上面盖着三个单位的公章——建筑工程部第四卫生设备安装工程公司的干部科、监察室和党委组织部。三个公章，意味着有三个单位负责，那末这份检讨应该是认真的、令人满意的了。然而不然。
    事情要从1955年7月的一封读者来信说起。在这封来信里，这个公司的工作人员郑宗立批评了公司里1954年年底职工家庭困难救济工作中的不合理现象：在这次救济工作中，公司的领导人员们争着把救济金塞进了自己的荷包，而真正需要救济的人却被遗忘在一边。当时公司里17个科长以上工作人员中的14个人就拿走了实发救济款的55％以上。群众的正当意见在公司里受到了白眼，那位读者就给报纸编辑部写了一封信。编辑部马上要求替建筑工程部代管这个公司的中南工程管理总局的党委会处理这个问题。在这以后，催办工作继续进行了五个月，到1955年12月才收到这份“检讨”。
    编辑部没有把那份“检讨”的内容转告郑宗立。为什么呢？只要把它摆在大家的面前，大家就会明白了。为了便于读者理解，下面把郑宗立的意见和这份“检讨”的有关部分（按原文摘录，只把个别不合语法的字句作了修改，“意见”部分则还加了一些联接语气的字句）写成了对话的形式。
    意见：救济办法公布了。哪些人才是救济的对象呢？按规定是：“家庭人口过多、缺乏劳动力而无法维持当地最低生活水平”，“父母年迈、弟妹幼小而无力抚养”，或者“家庭遭受天灾人祸而生活困难”的人。但是，制定规定的人并不按照规定办事，救济金甚至还发给了公司里日子过得最阔的周世瑞科长。他拿到40元救济金以后，就新添了一条上好料子的呢子裤子和高等质量的皮鞋。
    “检讨”：周同志平时不注意节约，是个缺点。但是这次发的是家庭困难救济金，他家里并不是不困难……。他有时下工地，不在工人食堂吃饭而下馆子；他有呢子衣服和绸子褂子……。但是，能说他就不应该救济吗？如果这样就不应该救济，那末等于说，科长以上的干部都不应该救济！说他用救济款买了一条呢子裤子和一双皮鞋，经我们了解，他的救济款都寄回家去了；他买呢子裤子和皮鞋，并不是用的救济款。
    意见：记得有这么一个笑话，一个傻小子接受了娘给的两个小钱去打酒和醋。结果没有打成，因为他弄不清哪一个钱该打酒，哪一个钱该打醋。看来，周科长这件事也不算奇怪。好吧，这且不说，救济办法里还有一条规定：“每人最多救济一百元”。但是，张哲经理没有让规定束住自己的手脚，他公然拿走了120元救济金。
    “检讨”：张哲经理确实是拿了120元救济金，但是其中有40元是他的两个要送到托儿所的小孩的被服补助费。
    意见：原来是这样！还有，据说，王旭副经理的岳母来到这里。为了祝贺这件“大喜事”，救济金项目下又增加了70元的支出。
    “检讨”：王副经理爱人胡玉兰同志的母亲从东北来看姑娘和外孙，往返万里，救济了70元，在情理上不能说不应该。家属来往是个最花钱的事情，这种滋味许多同志都尝过！
    意见：“家庭困难”这个词可以作多少各种各样奇怪的解释啊！只是救济办法中规定的解释却被取消了。请往下看看吧：工会的岳维民，一家四口人靠他30多元钱工资过活，不久前家里的房子又被洪水冲垮了；南昌工地的曾耀环，40多元工资要养活七口人；公务员彭小洲每个月只收入20多元，家里有瞎眼的父亲和年迈的母亲……。他们，都没有得到一分钱的救济。
    “检讨”：这些同志都是应该救济的，但是他们本人没有申请，因此都没有得到救济。
    意见：但是有些人本人也并没有申请，只是由于“热心人士”的代劳，却也得到了救济金。党委书记李郁刚出差回来，一百元钱就摆在他面前。赵如才主任家里收到了一笔不知来由的钱，奇怪得到处探问。大概由于却之不恭，他们也就没有拒绝。
    “检讨”：但是，这些钱也都经过某一负责同志的批准。如果说他们不应救济……，我们感到情理上说不通。
    意见：我无法理解这种奇怪的情理。让领导机关对这件事情做出应有的处理吧！
    “检讨”：我公司已经作过处理了！党委会讨论、检查了几次。张哲经理代表领导人员在党员、团员和工作人员大会上曾先后作过两次检讨。具体掌握救济工作的人事科长黄敬琪作了书面检讨。领导人员找对救济工作有意见的同志谈了话，承认了这次救济工作中的缺点和错误。我们认为这样做就算处理了。
    哦，这样的“检讨”就算“处理”了。所谓“检讨”，就是这样左一个“情理”，右一个“情理”。自己的做法，“在情理上不能说不应该”；别人的意见，“情理上说不通”。这是多么奇怪的“情理”啊！无怪郑宗立要感到无法理解了。如果非要用“情理”这两个字为这件事情下个评论不可，那末只能说：这个公司的某些领导人员在发救济金的时候徇了私“情”，而在对待群众批评的时候却一味地强词夺“理”。（附图片）
