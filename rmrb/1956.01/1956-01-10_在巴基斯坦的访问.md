Visit to Pakistan
Head of the Chinese Women's Delegation to Pakistan, Li Dequan

At the invitation of the All Pakistan Women's Association, the All-China Women's Federation sent a women's delegation led by me to visit Pakistan in November 1955. Our delegation of ten people arrived in the beautiful capital of Pakistan, Karachi, on November 22nd with excitement. We thank the All Pakistan Women's Association for giving me and my delegation such a rare opportunity to spend a pleasant and unforgettable three weeks with our dear sisters in Pakistan.

On the first day after arriving in Pakistan, we met with the Governor-General of Pakistan, Iskander Mirza, and Miss Fatima Jinnah. We also met with some leading figures from various fields. The atmosphere of the meetings was friendly and pleasant. The Governor-General's wife, the Prime Minister's wife, and the government officials of the cities we visited hosted banquets for us. Throughout the visit, we were treated with thoughtful hospitality.

Accompanied by Mrs. Malik, Vice-Chairman of the All Pakistan Women's Association, and officials from the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we visited seven famous cities including Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, Dhaka and Chittagong in East Pakistan, and Lahore, Quetta, Peshawar, and Hyderabad in West Pakistan. Although these places each have their own unique characteristics, they are all equally beautiful and moving. Our hosts arranged a very good itinerary for us, giving us the opportunity to see the largest Dhaka University and Punjab University in Pakistan, and to meet with more than 300 students, who enthusiastically asked about the situation in New China. We visited the famous Fatima Jinnah Medical College and the well-equipped Quetta Railway Workers Tuberculosis Sanatorium, which has more than 200 beds. Patients sleep in rooms with sunlight. It is said that they have a new treatment method for tuberculosis, directly infusing anti-tuberculosis drugs into the lungs, and there is new equipment for rib resection. One doctor said to us very enthusiastically: "Medicine has no national boundaries. We must join hands, exchange experiences more, and learn from each other to make more people healthy." In addition, we also visited the large Karala and Hyderabad water conservancy projects and some factories. We saw the new constructions in Pakistan since its founding. The people of Pakistan are working hard in all aspects to build their own country.

Pakistan has an ancient and rich culture, and their culture and art aroused great interest in me. We had the opportunity to admire many ancient buildings of artistic value. In Lahore, we visited one of the largest mosques in the world, the ancient and magnificent Badshahi Mosque, as well as the ancient imperial fort built in 1631, with exquisite marble carved railings and marble walls adorned with bead flowers and jewel-filled dark rooms. When a torch is lit, it is like countless beautiful stars shining in the azure sky. We have repeatedly enjoyed songs, dances and art works with Pakistani national style. The female students of Dhaka University performed a folk dance for us, showing how farmers seek rain, cultivate, harvest, and celebrate the harvest in the five seasons of summer, rain, autumn, winter, and spring. The beautiful dance fully expresses the people's desire to create their own better life. In the Dhaka Public Art School, we also saw many works depicting the lives of farmers and the lives of people during the great famine before Pakistan's independence, which were painted very powerfully and vividly. These beautiful and valuable artistic achievements demonstrate the respect and love of the Pakistani people for their excellent national culture and art traditions. We have every reason to believe that the hardworking people of Pakistan, inheriting their own excellent cultural traditions, will open up more brilliant and dazzling flowers in the process of continuous enrichment and development.

We paid close attention to the contributions made by Pakistani women in education, medical health, social welfare and other aspects. We talked with female members of the provincial parliament in Pakistan, as well as many female social welfare workers, doctors, female teachers and housewives, exchanging work situations. They are very concerned about the situation of women in New China in all aspects. A female teacher who has been engaged in education for many years asked: "Do Chinese women have equal employment opportunities with men, and what happens when teachers get old and can no longer teach?" Professional women are concerned about how China solves the difficulty of professional women taking care of their children. Many women are concerned about China's marriage law. What impressed us especially was the Pakistani women's demand for opposition to war and longing for peace. At a reception hosted by the Quetta Women's Association, a Pakistani woman said: "Humanity abhors war, and we women will condemn war and help create conditions for all countries to coexist peacefully." This is the voice of the vast majority of Pakistani women.

What is most unforgettable for us is the friendship and care of the Pakistani people and women for the Chinese people. Wherever we go, we have been warmly received by the hosts and cared for thoughtfully and kindly. The Pakistani sisters expressed their noble friendship to us with countless beautiful garlands. They sprinkled rose-made perfume on our heads and bodies to show their greatest respect to the guests. They treated us with exquisite large cakes with the national flags of China and Pakistan and welcoming words. They welcomed us with red felt carpets, and we could hear the shouts of "Hini, Pakistan, Zindabad!" (Long live China, Pakistan!) everywhere. We believe that this is not only for us, but more importantly, it is the friendship for the Chinese people. Every friend we had the opportunity to meet expressed an extremely strong interest in China, and they hoped to learn more about New China.

In the short three-week visit, we deeply felt that we and our sisters in Pakistan have a greater understanding and are closer, and the friendship between the people and women of the two countries has developed. China and Pakistan are close neighbors, and the people of the two countries have always maintained friendly relations. In the history of our two countries, there has never been a record of war, only records of friendly exchanges. We are both young countries, and we both retain the ancient culture of Asia. History has placed our two countries in similar positions in many aspects. We both participated in the Bandung Conference, and we are both implementers of the Bandung Conference resolutions. Many common points have formed the basis for friendly coexistence. The people of our two countries urgently need to build their own countries stronger and build their own lives better through their own long-term efforts. Therefore, although the social systems of our two countries are different, and although some Western colonialists are unwilling to see harmonious cooperation between Asian countries, our two countries should and can coexist peacefully and develop friendly relations.

We deeply feel that friendly visits between the people of the two countries, more mutual understanding, are of great benefit to friendly cooperation between the two countries. The important significance of the visit of the Pakistani women's delegation to China last year and the visit of the Chinese women's delegation to Pakistan this time lies here. I believe that in the future, the mutual visits of the people of China and Pakistan will increase day by day, and the cultural exchanges and trade exchanges between our two countries will also become more frequent. The friendship between the people of China and Pakistan, which is constantly developing, will be beneficial to the people of our two countries and will also help the friendly cooperation and prosperity of the Asian people.

Three weeks is not a long time, but Pakistan and its people have left a deep impression in our memory. I eagerly hope that in the near future, I will have the opportunity to receive Pakistani friends in our country as a host. (Attached picture)

### 在巴基斯坦的访问

　　在巴基斯坦的访问
    中国妇女访问巴基斯坦代表团团长　李德全
    中华全国民主妇女联合会应巴基斯坦全巴妇女协会的邀请，于1955年11月派我率领一个妇女代表团赴巴基斯坦访问。我们代表团的一行十人，怀着兴奋的心情，在11月22日到达了巴基斯坦美丽的首都喀喇蚩。感谢全巴妇女协会，给我和我的代表团这样一个难得的机会，使我们能和巴基斯坦亲爱的姐妹们，一同渡过了愉快的难忘的三个星期。
    抵巴基斯坦后的第一天，我们就会见了巴基斯坦总督伊斯坎德尔·米尔扎先生和法蒂玛·真纳女士。我们还会见了一些各方面的领袖人物，彼此接触的气氛是友好和愉快的。总督夫人、总理夫人和我们访问的城市的政府负责人都设宴招待了我们。在访问期间，我们一直是受着周到的招待。
    在全巴妇女协会副主席马立克夫人和巴基斯坦外交部官员陪同下，我们访问了巴基斯坦首都喀喇蚩、东巴基斯坦的达卡、吉大港、和西巴基斯坦的拉合尔、基达、白沙瓦、海得拉巴等七个著名的城市。这些地方虽然各有其独自的特点，但同样都是美丽动人的。我们的主人给我们安排了很好的访问节目，使我们能有机会看到巴基斯坦最大的达卡大学和旁遮普大学，同三百多学生见了面，他们都很热情的抢着问新中国的一些情况。我们参观了有名的法蒂玛·真纳医学院和设备完善的基达铁路工作人员肺病疗养院，这个疗养院有二百余个床位，病人睡在有日光的室内，据说他们对肺病有新式的治疗法，把肺病特效药直接灌入肺中，还有新式的割除肋骨的器材。一位医生很热情地向我们讲：“医学是没有国籍之分的，我们要携起手来，多交流经验，互相学习，使更多的人健康。”此外，我们还参观了喀拉巴和海得拉巴的大水闸及一些工厂。我们看到了巴基斯坦建国以来的新建设。巴基斯坦的人民，为建设自己的国家正在各方面努力工作着。
    巴基斯坦有着古老而丰富的文化，他们的文化艺术引起了我很大的兴趣，我们有机会瞻仰了许多有艺术价值的古代建筑。在拉合尔，我们参观了世界上最大的清真寺之一，古老壮丽的巴德沙希清真寺，还有建于1631年的古帝王的碉堡，用大理石雕刻的精致的栏干，用大理石砌的墙壁上饰满了珠花宝石的暗室，点起火把一照，好像是蔚蓝的天空中闪射着无数美丽的星星。我们曾经多次欣赏到富有巴基斯坦民族风格的歌唱、舞蹈和美术作品。达卡大学的女学生给我们表演了一个民间舞蹈，表现了农民在夏、雨、秋、冬、春五个季节中如何在求雨、耕作、收获和庆祝丰收。在优美的舞姿中，充分表现了人民对创造自己美好生活的渴望。在达卡的公立艺术学校中，我们也看到许多描写农民的生活和描写巴基斯坦独立以前大灾荒时人民生活情况的作品，画得非常有力和生动。这些优美的有价值的艺术成就，说明了巴基斯坦的人民对自己优良的民族文化艺术传统的尊重和爱好。我们完全有理由相信，巴基斯坦勤劳的人民，继承着自己的优良文化传统，在不断地丰富和发展的过程中，将会开放出更加光辉夺目的花朵。
    我们很注意地看到了巴基斯坦的妇女们在教育、医药卫生、社会福利等方面所作出的贡献。我们曾同巴基斯坦省的女议员，还有不少的女社会福利工作者、医生、女教师和家庭妇女们谈话，交流工作情况。她们很关心新中国妇女各方面的情况。一位多年从事教育工作的女教师问：“中国妇女是否和男子有同等就业的机会，教师老了不能再教书时怎么办？”职业妇女们关心到中国如何解决职业妇女照顾孩子的困难问题。很多妇女关心中国的婚姻法。特别使我们印象深的是，巴基斯坦的妇女反对战争、渴望和平的要求。在基达妇女协会招待我们的会上，有位巴基斯坦妇女讲：“人类厌恶战争，我们妇女将谴责战争，协助创造条件，使一切国家和平共处。”这就是代表广大巴基斯坦妇女们的呼声。
    最使我们难忘的是巴基斯坦人民和妇女对中国人民的友好和关怀，我们每到一个地方，都受到了主人隆重的接待，周到地亲切地关怀。巴基斯坦的姐妹们用无数美丽的花环向我们表达了她们高贵的友情，她们用玫瑰花作的香水洒在我们的头上身上，表示她们对客人最大的敬意。她们用精致的有着中巴两国国旗和欢迎字样的大蛋糕来款待我们。她们用红毡铺地来迎接我们，我们到处可以听到“希尼、巴基斯坦、辛得巴！”（中国、巴基斯坦万岁！）的呼声。我们认为，这不仅是对我们的、更重要的是对中国人民的情谊。我们有机会见到的每一位朋友，都对中国表示了极其浓厚的兴趣，他们希望更多的了解一些新中国的情况。
    在短短的三个星期的访问中，我们深深地感到我们和巴基斯坦的姐妹们是更加的了解，更加的接近了，发展了两国人民和妇女之间的友谊。中国和巴基斯坦是近邻，两国人民间历来就保持着友好的关系。在我们两国的历史上，从来没有战争的记录，只有友好往来的记载。我们都是年轻的国家，又都保有着亚洲古老的文化，历史曾经把我们两个国家在许多方面放在类似的地位上。我们都参加了万隆会议，我们都是万隆会议决议的执行者，许多共同点形成了彼此间能够友好相处的基础。我们两国的人民都迫切需要经过自己长时期的努力，把自己的国家建设得更富强，把自己的生活建设得更美好。因而尽管我们两国的社会制度不同，尽管一些西方国家的殖民主义分子不愿见到亚洲国家之间和睦合作，但我们两国是应该而且可以和平相处和发展友好关系的。
    我们深感两个国家人民间的友好访问，更多的互相了解，对两国间的友好合作是大有裨益的。去年巴基斯坦的妇女代表团到中国来访问，和此次中国妇女代表团的访巴的重要意义正在这里。我相信，今后中巴两国人民的相互访问将日益增加，我们两国的文化交流和贸易往还也将日益频繁。在不断发展中的中巴两国人民的友谊，将有利于我们两国人民也将有助于亚洲人民的友好合作和兴盛繁荣。
    三周的时间虽然是不长的，但巴基斯坦和它的人民，在我们的记忆中留下了深刻的印象。我热烈的盼望在不久的将来，能有机会在我们的国家里，以主人的身份接待巴基斯坦的朋友们。（附图片）
