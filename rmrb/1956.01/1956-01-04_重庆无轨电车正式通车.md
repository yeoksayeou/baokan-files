　　Chongqing Trolleybus Officially Opens to Traffic
    One day, Chongqing's trolleybus officially opened to traffic. This is a new type of trolleybus. It was manufactured by the Shanghai Bus Factory, modeled after Soviet electric locomotives, and tailored to Chongqing's characteristics of high slopes, narrow roads, many bends, and long foggy seasons. It has a long body, carries many passengers, is sturdy and lightweight, runs smoothly, and is equipped with anti-fog lights, allowing it to travel even in heavy fog. During the manufacturing and installation process, thanks to the active efforts of the workers, the trolleybus was put into operation more than forty days ahead of schedule. (Wu Bo)

　　重庆无轨电车正式通车
    一日，重庆市无轨电车正式通车了。这是一种新型的无轨电车。它是上海客车厂仿照苏联电气机车，并根据重庆坡度高、路面窄、弯道多和雾季长等的特点制造的。它的车身长、载客多、坚固轻巧、行驶平稳，车上并装有散雾灯，在大雾中也能行驶。在制造、安装等过程中，由于工人们的积极努力，使电车通车时间比原计划提早了四十多天。　（吴波）
