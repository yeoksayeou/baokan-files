　　Publish More Book Reviews
    Yang Xing
    China's publishing industry has developed greatly in the past few years. The number of publications has been increasing year by year, and the quality has also been continuously improving. However, at the same time, due to insufficient publicity and review work, many books with good content have not attracted the attention they deserve after publication; and some books with shortcomings and errors have not been criticized in time. Therefore, carrying out book review work in newspapers to guide the work of readers, authors, and publishers is of great significance.
    It should be pointed out that the book review work in newspapers has achieved certain results in the past few years. Many newspapers have reviewed some books in coordination with the publicity tasks of various periods. However, compared with the book publishing situation, the number of book reviews in newspapers is still small, especially the reviews of locally published books are too few. Taking the Liaoning Daily, Chongqing Daily, Southern Daily, and Shaanxi Daily from January to August 1955 as examples. During these eight months, Liaoning Daily published a total of 18 articles, Chongqing Daily 17 articles, Southern Daily 10 articles, and Shaanxi Daily 9 articles (excluding publishing newsletters). That is to say, Liaoning Daily, which published the most book reviews among the four newspapers, had a little more than two articles per month. And Shaanxi Daily, which published the least, averaged only a little more than one article per month. Secondly, most of these book reviews are reviews of literary novels. There are very few reviews of popular Marxist-Leninist reading materials, books that publicize and explain the Party's policies, and other cultural and scientific books, which are of concern to the majority of readers. Furthermore, most of these book reviews are reviews of publications from central-level publishing houses, and very few are reviews of local publications. For example, among the 17 book reviews in Chongqing Daily, 12 are reviews of literary novels; only two are reviews of local publications. The situation of Shaanxi Daily and Liaoning Daily is roughly the same as this. In this way, it is neither possible to widely guide readers in reading, nor can it fulfill the responsibility of supervising local publishing work.
    Is it that not many books were published in these places during this period, or that there were not many problems worth reviewing? That is not the case. During these eight months, not only were national publications widely distributed in these regions, but also many books were published locally. For example, Liaoning People's Publishing House published more than 100 kinds of books in January to May 1955 alone. The book "How Mutual Aid Teams Prepare to Establish Agricultural Production Cooperatives" sold more than 200,000 copies and aroused good response among readers. However, the book "Treasure Island of the Motherland - Taiwan" simply described how rich Taiwan's products are, how developed its industry is, how beautiful its cities are, how convenient its transportation is, and how magnificent its projects are, etc. Regarding the current decline of Taiwan's industry, the control of Taiwan's industry by American imperialism, and the plight of Taiwan's national industry and commerce, only a few words were mentioned in the last section. Obviously, the newspaper has the responsibility to recommend the above-mentioned books with better content and to criticize books with shortcomings. However, Liaoning Daily did not do so.
    This situation should obviously be changed. In order to achieve this, the newspaper editorial department must pay attention to the work of book review. The editorial department should not only have dedicated people to manage this work, but also mobilize all groups in the entire editorial department to participate in this work. And because book reviews involve a wide range of knowledge, a large number of publications, and many categories, it is necessary to rely on the strength of experts and activists in various fields. The editorial department needs to regularly propose specific review topics to them, tell them the opinions and requirements of readers, and help them complete the writing topics. It is also necessary to discover and cultivate book review authors and expand the writing team through various reading activities in the community. In addition, newspapers should also regularly understand the publishing plans of publishing houses, organize the staff of publishing houses and the authors contacted by the publishing houses to write book review manuscripts for the newspaper. Only in this way can newspapers publish more book reviews to meet the needs of the majority of readers, authors, and publishing workers.

　　更多地发表图书评论
    杨星
    我国的出版事业几年来有了很大的发展。出版物的数量逐年都在增加，质量也在不断地提高。但是在这同时，由于宣传评介工作做得不够，许多内容较好的书，出版后没有引起应有的注意；而一些有缺点有错误的书，又没有及时受到批评。因此，在报纸上开展图书评论的工作，以指导读者、作者和出版社的工作，就有着十分重要的意义。
    应该指出，几年来报纸上的图书评论工作是有一定成绩的。不少报纸配合各个时期的宣传任务，评介了一些书籍。但是同图书出版情况来比较，报纸上的图书评论数量还少，特别是对当地出版书籍的评论太少。以1955年1月到8月的辽宁日报、重庆日报、南方日报和陕西日报为例。在这八个月中，辽宁日报共发表了18篇，重庆日报17篇，南方日报十篇，陕西日报九篇（出版简讯未计在内）。这就是说，四个报纸中发表图书评论最多的辽宁日报，每月有两篇多一点。而发表得最少的陕西日报，平均每月只有一篇多一点。其次，这些图书评论大多数评介的是文艺小说，对于广大读者所关心的马克思列宁主义的通俗读物，宣传和解释党的各项政策的图书，以及其他文化科学方面的书籍，却很少评介。并且，这些图书评论大都是评介中央级出版社的出版物，很少评介当地的出版物。如重庆日报的17篇图书评论中，有12篇是评介文艺小说的；评介当地出版物的只有两篇。陕西日报和辽宁日报的情况，和这也大致相同。这样，就既不能广泛地指导读者进行阅读，也不能对当地的出版工作尽到监督的责任。
    是不是这个期间在这些地方没有出版多少书籍，或者没有多少问题值得评介呢？不是这样。在这八个月中，不但有全国性的出版物在这些地区大量发行，而且在当地也有许多书籍出版。例如，辽宁人民出版社仅1955年1至5月就出版了一百多种书。“互助组怎样准备建立农业生产合作社”一书，销行在20万册以上，在读者中引起了较好的反映。而“祖国的宝岛—台湾”这本书，却单纯描写了台湾的物产如何丰富，工业如何发达，城市如何优美，交通如何便利，工程如何雄伟等等。对于目前台湾工业的凋蔽，美帝国主义控制了台湾的工业以及台湾的民族工商业的厄运等方面，只在最末一节略略说了几句。显而易见，报纸是有责任对上述内容较好的书加以推荐，对有缺点的书加以批评的。但是辽宁日报却没有这样做。
    这种情况显然应当加以改变。为了作到这一点，报纸编辑部必须把图书评论的工作重视起来。编辑部不但要有专门的人来掌管这项工作，而且应当发动全编辑部各组，都来参加这项工作。而由于图书评论涉及的知识范围很广，出版物的数量很大，门类又很多，因此又必须注意依靠各方面的专家和积极分子的力量。编辑部有必要经常向他们提出具体的评论题目，告诉他们读者的意见和要求，帮助他们完成写作的题目。也需要通过社会上的各种读书活动，来发现和培养书评的作者，扩大写作队伍。此外，报纸还应当经常了解出版社的出书计划，组织出版社的工作人员和出版社所联系的作者，为报纸写作书评稿件。只有这样，报纸才能发表更多的图书评论，来满足广大读者、作者和出版工作者的需要。
