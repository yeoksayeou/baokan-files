    Economic Construction Achievements of the Indian People
    Feng Zhidan
    The Republic of India has been established for 6 years. For 6 years, young India has been advancing along the road of independent development.
    India is our neighbor. It possesses a vast territory of more than 2.94 million square kilometers and a population of more than 370 million.
    Since ancient times, India has had a very developed culture and economy. The banks of the Indus and Ganges rivers contain rich underground treasures. Nearly a quarter of the world's iron ore reserves are in India. India's manganese ore production accounts for about 15% of the world's production, and its mica production accounts for 60%. India also possesses abundant hydropower resources estimated at 40 million kilowatts. Its fertile land is rich in grain, cotton, jute, oilseeds, tobacco, and sugarcane.
    India has such abundant natural resources, and such a large number of hardworking and intelligent people; however, due to its long-term oppression and exploitation by Western colonialists, it was once very backward economically. During the nearly two centuries of British colonial rule in India, 94% of Indian farmers were in abject poverty. And India paid Britain various forms of tribute of about 150 million pounds each year. The dividends of British jute and textile factories in India reached 100% to 200%, while 5 to 6 million Indians died of hunger and epidemics every year. Indian Prime Minister Nehru wrote in his book "The Discovery of India": Many of India's current disasters, including the backwardness and stagnation of the Indian economy, "occurred during the British rule and are a direct result of British policy."
    In order to get rid of the fate of being enslaved, the Indian people waged a long and heroic struggle. During and after World War II, the Indian people launched a massive movement for national independence. In 1947, as a result of the tenacious struggle of the Indian people, the British colonialists were forced to make concessions, and India began to embark on the road of independent development.
    On January 26, 1950, the Republic of India was established, which made it possible for India to further seek independent development. However, the wounds left by the colonialists on the country's economy were extremely deep. Although India has surprisingly abundant resources for the development of industry, it is still an agricultural country with a very weak industrial base, and 70% of its residents are engaged in agriculture.
    At the same time, foreign monopoly capital—mainly British capital—is not willing to give up its position in India. According to materials published by the Indian Central Government Secretariat in 1951, foreign capital controlled more than 85% of India's petroleum, rubber, matches, jute weaving industry, and almost three-quarters of the mining industry. This situation seriously hinders the independent development of India's national economy.
    Therefore, after gaining national independence and sovereignty, the most urgent task for the Indian people is to continue to work hard to achieve economic independence and eliminate the traces left by colonialism. Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out: "If India is to be truly independent and move forward, it must be economically independent."
    To this end, the Indian government formulated an economic development program for 1951-1956, which in India is called the "First Five-Year Plan." This economic program stipulates that the total investment in the state-owned economy will be more than 20 billion rupees in 5 years. Among them, the proportion of investment in industry accounts for 8.4%. Although the investment task has not been completed in the four years since the plan was implemented; however, India's industrial production is still rising steadily. If the lower production level of India in 1946 is taken as the base, then the industrial production index in 1954 rose to 146.6, and reached 167 in April 1955. As a result, some state-owned enterprises have been built; other state-owned enterprises have been significantly expanded, and relying on private investment, light industry has further grown. Indian enterprises have also been able to manufacture some new products that could not be manufactured in the past.
    In the years after India's independence, India spent considerable effort in developing electrification, especially the comprehensive utilization of domestic water resources. More than 100 water conservancy projects of varying scales are under construction throughout India, including the construction of hydroelectric power stations on the Damodar River Valley, Kosi, Bakra-Nangal, and Mahanadi River Valley, which are larger in scale. For 6 years, the Indian government's annual investment in electrification has been more than the investment made by British colonialists in an entire century. There is no doubt that the comprehensive utilization of abundant water resources is of great significance in the cause of developing India's economy.
    In agriculture, thanks to the adoption of some measures, especially the construction of water conservancy projects, the sown area and yield of grains have increased to some extent in the past 6 years. From 1948 to 1954, India needed to import an average of more than 2.7 million tons of grain each year. However, from January to August 1955, India only imported nearly 700,000 tons of grain.
    In India's rural areas, the irrational feudal land system still shackles the development of productive forces. Once this situation is changed, India's agricultural production, even under the existing technical conditions, can still exert great potential, and it is entirely possible to expand the domestic market, thereby helping to promote the development of industry. The Indian government is promoting a land reform program in rural areas in many states and has stipulated land compensation fees.
    Some time ago, the Imperial Bank of India, which had long been the link between British financial capitalists and Indian usury capitalists, was nationalized, which is a measure conducive to the independent development of the Indian economy.
    In July 1955, the Indian government made a decision on the investment plan for the "Second Five-Year Plan." Indian Prime Minister Nehru, when visiting the Soviet Union, talked about the basic principle of this plan, which will be to "particularly focus on the development of heavy industry." This policy undoubtedly reflects the interests and desires of the Indian people. Because the establishment and development of heavy industry is the most reliable guarantee for maintaining India's independence.
    The total investment in India's "Second Five-Year Plan" is estimated to be 56 billion rupees, of which investment in the state-owned economy will be 48 billion rupees, which is almost double the figure for investment in the state-owned economy in the First Five-Year Plan, and the investment requirement for industry will reach 26% of the national investment. According to a draft of the "Second Five-Year Plan" proposed by Indian Professor Mahalanobis, in 1960-1961, India should produce 5 million tons of steel annually, more than three times the increase in 1953-1954. According to Professor Mahalanobis's proposal, during the Second Five-Year Plan, some heavy machinery manufacturing plants and large electrical equipment factories will be built.
    Of course, there are still many difficulties in the course of the development of India's national economy. For example, the lack of funds, technology, and cadres. The development of the Indian economy currently still depends on the import of various machinery and equipment, and the monopoly capitalists of the United States and Britain are using this to obstruct India's industrialization. From the three fiscal years of 1951-1952 to 1953-1954, the total value of industrial equipment imported into India has decreased from 1,086,000 rupees to 838,000 rupees, and the proportion of metal manufacturing equipment is even more insignificant. However, all these difficulties cannot force the Indian people to abandon their determination to develop the national economy.
    Because India pursues an independent and autonomous foreign policy, it has strengthened economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, and strengthened economic cooperation with Asian and African countries, which is greatly beneficial to the development of India's national economy.
    In particular, the Soviet Union, with its superb technology and preferential loans, is helping India build a new metallurgical factory with an annual output of 1 million tons of steel, which will be fully put into production in 1959. The completion of the new metallurgical factory will be an important link in India's industrialization. Recently, the governments of the Soviet Union and India have agreed that the Soviet Union will sell 1 million tons of steel to India within 3 years to help India's construction cause. Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium member Khrushchev expressed the warm friendship of the Soviet people to the Indian people during his visit to India. He said: "We sincerely hope that India can be as great and powerful in its economy as it is today in its spirit, culture, and morality. We hope that it has a highly developed industry, developed agriculture, and a high standard of living for its people. For our part, we are willing to help you in this beautiful and remarkable cause."
    The Indian people have achieved good results in the glorious cause of maintaining national independence and continuously developing their national economy in the past 6 years. With the increasing consolidation and development of friendship between India and the Soviet Union, China, and other Asian and African countries, the Indian people will achieve more significant achievements.

    印度人民的经济建设成就
    冯之丹
    印度共和国建国已经6周年了。6年以来，年轻的印度正沿着独立发展的道路前进。
    印度是我国的邻邦。它拥有294万多平方公里辽阔的国土，有37，000多万人口。
    从很古的时候起，印度就有很发达的文化和经济。在印度河和恒河两岸，蕴藏着丰富的地下宝藏。全世界将近四分之一的铁矿藏量是在印度。印度的锰矿产量约占世界产量的15％，云母产量占到60％。印度还拥有估计为4，000万瓩的丰富的水力资源。它的肥沃的土地盛产粮食、棉花、黄麻、油籽油料、烟叶和甘蔗等。
    印度有这样富足的自然资源，又有这样众多的勤劳智慧的人民；但是，由于它长期受到西方殖民主义者的压迫和剥削，在经济上曾经是很落后的。在英国殖民者统治印度的将近两个世纪期间，印度有94％的农户陷于赤贫。而印度每年纳给英国各种形式的贡赋约为15，000万英镑。在印度的英国织麻工厂和纺织工厂的股息达到100％到200％，而每年印度死于饥饿瘟疫的有500万到600万人。印度总理尼赫鲁在他的“印度的发现”一书中写道：现在印度的许多灾难，包括印度经济的落后和停滞，“是发生在英国统治时期，并且是英国政策的直接结果”。
    为了摆脱被奴役的命运，印度人民进行了长期的英勇斗争。在第二次世界大战期间及以后，印度人民掀起了巨大规模的争取民族独立的运动。1947年，由于印度人民顽强斗争的结果，英国殖民者被迫让步，印度开始走上了独立发展的道路。
    1950年1月26日，印度共和国成立了，这就使印度有了进一步求得独立发展的可能性。但是，殖民主义者在经济方面留给这个国家的创伤是极其深重的。尽管印度有着惊人丰富的资源可供发展工业的需要，但它仍然是一个农业国，工业基础极为薄弱，70％的居民从事农业。
    同时，外国垄断资本——主要是英国资本——还不甘心放弃它们在印度的阵地。据1951年印度中央政府秘书处公布的材料，外国资本控制了85％以上的印度石油、橡胶、火柴、麻织工业和差不多四分之三的采矿工业。这一情况严重地妨碍着印度国民经济的独立发展。
    因此，印度人民在取得国家的独立主权后，最迫切的任务是继续努力取得经济上的独立，消除殖民主义所留下来的痕迹。印度总理尼赫鲁指出：“如果印度要真正独立和要向前迈进的话，它必须在经济上独立。”
    为此，印度政府曾经制定了一个1951—1956年经济发展大纲，在印度，这个大纲被称为“第一个五年计划”。这个经济大纲规定在5年内对于国营经济的总投资额为200多亿卢比。其中投资于工业的比重占8.4％。虽然在计划实行后的四年以来，投资任务并没有完成；但是，印度的工业生产还是在平稳地上升着。如以1946年印度历年较低的生产水平为基数，那末，1954年工业生产指数就上升到了146.6，1955年4月达到了167。结果，一些国营企业被建设起来；另一些国营企业有了显著的扩大，并依靠私人的投资，轻工业有了进一步的增长。印度的企业并且已经能够制造一些过去所不能制造的新的产品。
    在印度独立后的年代中，印度用了相当大的力量去从事发展电气化的事业，尤其是国内水力资源的综合利用的工作。在印度各地，正在建设着100处以上规模不同的水利工程，其中规模较大的有达莫达尔河谷、柯西、巴克拉—南格尔、玛哈那地等河谷上的水电站的建筑工程。6年以来，印度政府每年对于电气化的投资比英国殖民者在整整一世纪中的投资还要多。毫无疑问，对于丰富的水力资源的综合利用，在发展印度经济的事业中是有着重要的意义的。
    在农业方面，6年以来，由于采取了一些措施，特别是兴修水利的结果，谷物播种面积及产量已有所增长。自1948年至1954年的7年中，印度平均每年需输入270多万吨粮食。但自1955年1月至8月，印度只输入了近70万吨粮食。
    在印度的农村中，不合理的封建土地制度还束缚着生产力的发展。这种情况一旦改变，印度的农业生产即令在现有的技术条件下，还能发挥极大的潜力，并且完全有可能扩大国内市场，从而有利于促使工业的发展。印度政府在许多邦的农村中，正推行一种土地改革方案，并规定了土地赔偿费。
    前些时候，长期作为英国金融资本家和印度高利贷资本家的纽带的印度帝国银行已实行了国有化，这是一个有利于印度经济独立发展的措施。
    1955年7月，印度政府作出了关于“第二个五年计划”投资方案的决定。印度总理尼赫鲁在访问苏联时，曾经谈到这个计划的基本方针，将是“特别着重发展重工业”。这个方针无疑是反映了印度人民的利益和愿望的。因为建立和发展重工业，是维护印度独立的最可靠的保证。
    印度的“第二个五年计划”的总投资额预计是560亿卢比，其中对国营经济的投资将为480亿卢比，比第一个五年计划中对国营经济投资的数字增加了将近一倍，而对于工业的投资要求达到国家投资的26％。根据印度马哈拉诺比斯教授所提出的一个“第二个五年计划”的草案，1960—1961年，印度应该年产钢500万吨，比1953—1954年增长三倍以上。根据马哈拉诺比斯教授的建议，在第二个五年计划期间，一些重型机器制造厂及大型电气装备工厂将被建设起来。
    当然，在印度民族经济的发展的路程上还存在着不少困难。例如资金、技术和干部的缺乏等等。印度经济的发展目前还有赖于各种机器装备的输入，而美英两国的垄断资本家正利用这一点来阻挠印度的工业化。从1951—1952到1953—1954的三个年度中，输入印度的工业装备总值已由1，086，000卢比减少到838，000卢比，其中金属制造装备所占的比重更微不足道。但是，所有这些困难都不能迫使印度人民放弃发展民族经济的决心。
    由于印度奉行着独立自主的对外政策，它加强了同苏联、中国以及其它人民民主国家的经济合作，加强了同亚非国家的经济合作，这就大大地有利于印度民族经济的发展。
    特别是苏联以精湛的技术和优惠的贷款正在帮助印度建设一个年产100万吨钢的新的冶金工厂，这个工厂将在1959年全部投入生产。新冶金工厂的建成，对于印度的工业化将是一个重要的环节。最近，苏、印两国政府更协议，在3年内将由苏联售给印度100万吨钢材，以帮助印度的建设事业。苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫在访问印度期间曾经向印度人民表明了苏联人民的热烈的友情。他说：“我们真诚地希望印度能在经济上也同它今天在精神上、文化上和道义上同样伟大和强大的国家。我们希望它有高度发展的工业，发达的农业和人民的高度生活水平。在我们方面，我们愿意在这个美好和了不起的事业中帮助你们。”
    印度人民6年来在维护民族独立和不断发展自己的民族经济的光荣事业中，已经获得良好的成就。随着印度和苏联、中国以及其他亚非国家的友谊的日益巩固和发展，印度人民将要取得更显著的成就。
