    A Rolling Mill is Backlogged
　　To the Editor:
    The Northwest Automotive Tool Repair Factory has a rolling mill, valued at 220,000 yuan, that is backlogged. This rolling mill was purchased in 1953 and has not been used to this day. Due to poor storage, the transformer and gearbox (each worth over 10,000 yuan) on this machine have rusted. The rolling mill cannot be installed, which also prevents a steel heating furnace that cost more than 40,000 yuan to build from being used.
    Originally, the Northwest Automotive Tool Repair Factory's addition of this equipment in 1953 was completely blind. As a result, the performance of the purchased rolling mill is not suitable for the factory's production needs, and installing it would require an additional 154,000 yuan in equipment investment. Thus, the machine has been backlogged.
    The Northwest Automotive Tool Repair Factory should examine this practice of blindly purchasing equipment and quickly find a way to properly handle the backlogged rolling mill. 　Hu Chunzhi

    积压了一部轧钢机
　　编辑同志：
    西北汽车机具修配厂积压着一部价值22万元的轧钢机。这部轧钢机是1953年买来的，直到现在还没有用过。由于保管不善，这部机器上的变压器和变速牙齿箱（价值都在一万元以上）已经生了锈。轧钢机不能安装，还使得一座花了四万多元修起来的烘钢炉不能用。
    原来，西北汽车机具修配厂在1953年增添这项设备的时候，完全是盲目的。因此，买来的这部轧钢机的性能不适合厂里生产的需要，而且要安装起来还得增加154，000多元的设备资金。这样，机器就被积压起来了。
    西北汽车机具修配厂应该检查这种盲目购置设备的做法，并且迅速设法妥善处理积压的轧钢机。　胡纯智
