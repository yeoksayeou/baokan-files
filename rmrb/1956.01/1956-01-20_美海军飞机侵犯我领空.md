    美海军飞机侵犯我领空
    新华社19日讯　美国海军舰队18日在我国大陈岛以东200余公里海面进行军事活动，并派遣它的海军飞机5批12架次侵犯我国沿海岛屿和大陆领空进行军事挑衅。
    18日，美国海军舰队在我国大陈岛以东200余公里海面出现，在8时43分和8时50分，先后有美国海军飞机3批6架次，分别侵入我国大陈岛和披山岛附近领海上空，进行挑衅。另外有两批6架次，在8时49分和9时53分，公然侵犯我国大陆领空进行军事挑衅。这些美国飞机侵犯的地区有我国浙江省楚门、隘顽所、温岑、路桥、海门、黄岩、南田岛等。
    这是在今年1月份中，美国军用飞机继1月9日侵犯我国东北领空之后的又一次公开侵犯我国领空的挑衅行为。中国人民对于美国海军在靠近中国大陆的海上进行军事活动，并且屡次派遣它的军用飞机侵犯我国领空的挑衅行为，表示极度的愤怒和严重抗议。
