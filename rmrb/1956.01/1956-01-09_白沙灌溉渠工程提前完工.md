    Baisha Irrigation Canal Project Completed Ahead of Schedule
    The Baisha Irrigation Canal project in Henan Province was completed in mid-December of last year, six months ahead of schedule, and has now been put into operation to irrigate wheat fields.
    The Baisha Irrigation Canal project is located in Yuxian County, in the upper reaches of the Ying River, and uses the water stored in the Baisha Reservoir to irrigate farmland. The entire irrigation canal project is 60 kilometers long. This project can be used to irrigate 230,000 mu of farmland and can also eliminate the threat of waterlogging in more than 20,000 mu of low-lying land within the irrigation area. After the full effectiveness of the irrigation project is realized, it is estimated that it can increase the production of grain, flue-cured tobacco, and other agricultural products by more than 25 million jin annually.

    白沙灌溉渠工程提前完工
    河南省白沙灌溉渠工程在去年12月中旬提前半年修建完工，现在已经放水灌溉麦田。
    白沙灌溉渠工程位于颍河上游的禹县境内，利用白沙水库的蓄水灌溉农田。全部灌溉渠工程长达60公里。这项工程可以用来灌溉农田23万亩，并且可以免除灌溉区内二万多亩低洼地的内涝威胁。灌溉工程的全部效能发挥以后，估计每年可以增产粮食、烤烟等农产品2，500多万斤。
