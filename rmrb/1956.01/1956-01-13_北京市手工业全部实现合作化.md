    (Our report) Beijing’s handicraft industries completely achieved cooperativization on the 12th.

    On the 11th, Beijing had just held a conference to celebrate the joining of 30,000 handicraft workers into handicraft cooperatives. On the 12th, another 23,800 handicraft workers joined the cooperatives. Adding the more than 36,000 old members who had already joined, all handicraft workers in the city have embarked on the road to cooperativization.

    Of the newly applying members, 30,000 joined the old cooperatives, and more than 23,800 organized new cooperatives and production teams.

    On the afternoon of the 11th, after the city-wide celebration conference for the cooperativization of handicraft industries, thousands of handicraft workers immediately went to the district offices of the Beijing Handicraft Cooperative Union and the district handicraft workers' associations to apply for membership.

    Handicraft workers who were approved to join the cooperative hung lanterns and colored streamers and pasted large red banners with the words "Celebrating Cooperativization" on the evening of the 11th. Xuanwu District also held a 2,000-person get-together. On the 12th, handicraft workers in the stationery and woodenware industries of Xidan District specifically went to the General Office to report the good news and promised to strengthen the unity between new and old members and improve production in the future.

    To celebrate the complete cooperativization of handicraft industries in Beijing, more than 50,000 handicraft workers in the city held grand parades in various districts on the 12th. The parade teams also went to the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee to report the good news. Peng Zhen, Liu Ren, Zhang Youyu, Wang Kunlun, and Chai Zemin and other responsible comrades personally congratulated the handicraft workers.

    Subsequently, the parade teams gathered in front of Tiananmen Square. When the new and old members met on the square, everyone enthusiastically shouted: "New and old members unite to run the cooperatives well," "Strive to produce and complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule," "Ensure that construction and production are not delayed during the establishment of cooperatives."

    Then, more than 50,000 handicraft workers held a garden party and get-together at the Working People's Cultural Palace.
