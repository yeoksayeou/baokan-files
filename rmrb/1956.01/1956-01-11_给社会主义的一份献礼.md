    A Gift to Socialism
    Zhang Hu
    Yesterday, firecrackers and drums resounded all day long, and teams of good news reporters from various industries passed through every street one after another. The good news reporting team from the state-owned medicine industry also went everywhere to report good news. Within this industry, Yang Yanwen, manager of the Yong'an Tang Chinese medicine store in Dongdan District, and Fu Jiantang, the deputy manager, contributed more than 230 jin of precious medicinal materials such as musk, bezoar, and cinnabar to the enterprise after the enterprise became a joint state-private venture. Their actions won the praise of the people and also inspired the capitalists in the same industry. In these two days, Liu Xuedao, manager of the Chuan Yuan Medicine Shop, contributed six jin of ginseng and ten jin of cinnabar to the enterprise; Zhou Zijian, a shareholder of Yong'an Tang, also invested two hundred jin of costus root and some rhinoceros horn cups.
    Before liberation, the value of counterfeit money was low, and prices rose like kites with broken strings. Many industrial and commercial households preferred to hoard goods rather than save money. At that time, Yang Yanwen was responsible for purchasing goods and took the opportunity to buy some precious medicinal materials to store. Fu Jiantang also asked him to buy some with his money, and slowly they accumulated more and more. At that time, they did it partly to avoid losses and partly in the hope of making more money in resale.
    In the years after liberation, prices stabilized, and the prices of medicines across the country were roughly unified, but they still did not sell these medicinal materials. Yang Yanwen was older and did not have many family members. He thought: "The money earned in the shop is enough, and I am responsible for purchasing goods. Wouldn't others gossip if I sold these medicinal materials? Besides, I am getting older, and I have been hearing about joint state-private ownership in recent years, but I don't know what it is really like. Let's just keep them!" Fu Jiantang also kept them without selling.
    In December of last year, the state-owned medicine industry was discussing the implementation of joint state-private ownership for the entire industry. In a few days, they participated in many large and small meetings, recognized the state's policy of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and they were no longer worried about their jobs and livelihoods after the joint venture. Yang Yanwen and Fu Jiantang also began to discuss how to deal with this batch of medicinal materials. Sell them and buy government bonds? Inappropriate. Invest them? It seems inappropriate. They aren't shareholders, and if they aren't invited, can they invest? Once, Yang Yanwen met several colleagues and talked about this matter. They said: Investing in this store or in an investment company is fine, either way you are contributing to socialism. Yang Yanwen discussed it with Fu Jiantang when he returned. They felt that these precious medicinal materials would be wasted if they were kept, and they could play a role in the people's medical and health care, so they decided to invest all of them in the enterprise.
    On January 7th, the city's state-owned medicine industry implemented joint state-private ownership. Yang Yanwen reported his experiences at the celebration meeting. He said excitedly to everyone: "This is our gift to socialism!"

    给社会主义的一份献礼
    张沪
    昨天，鞭炮、锣鼓整整响了一天，各行业的报喜队一队一队接连不断地走过每一条大街。国药业那支报喜队也到各处去报喜。就在这个行业里，东单区永安堂国药店经理杨彦文、副理傅鉴堂在企业合营以后，拿出了麝香、牛黄、朱砂等贵重药材230多斤投入了企业。他们这一行动博得了人们的赞扬，也启发了同行业的资本家。在这两天里，川原药社经理刘学道拿出了六斤人参、十来斤朱砂投入企业；永安堂股东周子鉴也把存放着的二百斤木香和一些犀角杯投入企业。
    解放以前，伪币不值钱，物价像脱了线的风筝往上升，工商业户有许多人宁可存东西也不存钱。当时，杨彦文负责办货，得便就买点贵重药材存起来。傅鉴堂有了钱也托他买一些，慢慢地就越存越多。那时候他们一来为了不吃亏；二来也希望转手之间能多赚些钱。
    解放几年后，物价稳定了，全国各地的药价也大致统一了，但是他们还是不把这些药材拿出来卖。杨彦文年岁大些，家里人口也不多，他想：“在铺子里挣的钱也够用了，我又是个负责办货的，要卖了这些药材，别人不会说闲话么？再说年纪也大了，这几年老听说要公私合营，不知道到底怎么样，存着罢！”傅鉴堂也存着没有卖出。
    去年12月间，国药业在商量全行业实行公私合营了。几天里，他们参加了不少大会小会，认清了国家对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的政策，他们过去发愁合营后的工作问题，发愁生活问题，现在他们都看清楚了，不发愁了。杨彦文、傅鉴堂两人也开始商量怎样处理这批药材。卖了买公债？不合适。投资罢？好像也不合适，自己又不是股东，别人不邀你，能投资么？杨彦文有一次遇见几个同行，谈起这事。他们说：投入本店，投入投资公司都可以，反正是为社会主义出一分力量。杨彦文回来同傅鉴堂一商量，觉得这些贵重药材存着也是白存着，拿出来还能在人民的医疗保健事业中起作用，于是决定全部投入企业。
    1月7日那天，全市国药业实行公私合营，杨彦文在庆祝大会上报告了自己的体会，他激动地向大家说：“这就是我们给社会主义的一份献礼！”
