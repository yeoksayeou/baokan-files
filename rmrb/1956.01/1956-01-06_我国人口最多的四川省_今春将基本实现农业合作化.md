China's Most Populous Province, Sichuan Province
    Will Basically Achieve Agricultural Cooperativization This Spring

    Sichuan Province, China's most populous province, will basically achieve semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization this spring. This was recently decided by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. By February of this year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the province will increase from the current 160,000 to 210,000, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives will reach 70% of the total number of peasant households.

    During the first upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement in Sichuan Province, various localities generally overfulfilled the original plan for establishing cooperatives ahead of schedule. As of December 25, 1955, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the province had increased from more than 57,000 in the autumn to more than 160,000, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives reached 6 million, accounting for more than 50% of the total number of peasant households. The more than 100,000 newly established cooperatives are all of relatively good quality. At present, these new cooperatives are carrying out rectification and consolidation work in conjunction with production. (Report from our correspondent in Chengdu)

    我国人口最多的四川省
    今春将基本实现农业合作化
    我国人口最多的四川省将在今年春天基本上实现半社会主义的农业合作化。这是中共四川省委最近决定的。到今年二月间，全省农业生产合作社将由现在的16万个增加到21万个，入社农户将达总农户的70％。
    四川省农业合作化运动第一个高潮中，各地普遍提前超额完成了原定建社计划。截至1955年12月25日，全省农业生产合作社已经由秋季的5.7万多个发展到16万多个，入社农户达六百万户，占总农户的50％以上。新建的十多万个新社，质量都比较好。现在，这些新社正在结合生产进行整顿巩固工作。（本报驻成都记者）
