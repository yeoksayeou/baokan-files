Qinghai Province will pilot seven elementary-level pastoral production cooperatives in the pastoral areas of Hainan, Haibei, Haixi, and Huangnan this spring. The pilot work will be directly led by the local Party committees. After preliminary publicity, the majority of herdsmen have enthusiastically supported the establishment of pastoral production cooperatives. Currently, the aforementioned areas are, based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, deliberating and discussing specific issues such as livestock shares, labor days, and profit distribution ratios for livestock shares. Problems related to meat consumption, milking, and horseback riding for herdsmen after joining the cooperative will also be given full consideration based on the herdsmen's habits, under the principle of ensuring the cooperative's planned production.

These areas generally already possess the conditions for establishing pastoral production cooperatives. In the Sujitan area of Qilian Hui Autonomous County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the initially organized herding households have reached 83.44% of the total number of herding households.

    青海将试办牧业合作社
    今年春天，青海省牧业区海南、海北、海西、黄南等地将试办七个初级形式的牧业生产合作社。试办工作由各地委直接领导。经过初步宣传，广大牧民都热烈拥护建立牧业生产合作社。现在，上述地区正根据自愿互利原则，对牲畜入股和劳动日、畜股的分红比例等具体问题进行酝酿讨论。对牧民入社后食肉、挤奶、骑马等问题，也将根据牧民的习惯，在保证合作社有计划地进行生产等原则下给予充分照顾。
    这些地区一般都已具备了建立牧业生产合作社的条件。海北藏族自治州亹源回族自治县苏吉滩地区初步组织起来的牧户，已达到了牧户总数的83.44％。　（青海日报编辑部）
