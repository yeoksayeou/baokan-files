Currently, in some areas of Hubei Province, there is a phenomenon of randomly pulling junior high school students who are still in school to serve as accountants for agricultural production cooperatives. Some township cadres directly mobilize students, saying: "If you come back to be an accountant, you can get 14 yuan a month and you can immediately join the Party." Some cooperative cadres mobilize students through their parents, saying: "Staying in school requires bearing costs, but going back to be an accountant can earn 30 workdays a month, how great is that! Even if you graduate after staying in school, you will still have to return home to engage in production!" What is even more noteworthy is that some local Party committees are also transferring students in school to be accountants. For example, the CCP Xin Zhou County Committee once instructed the County Bureau of Culture and Education to transfer 50 students each from the First Junior High School and the Second Junior High School to attend an accounting training class (later stopped by the higher Party committee). This practice has caused ideological confusion among some students in the schools, generating ideas such as "better to drop out of school sooner than later, better to become a cadre sooner than later." According to statistics from 6 junior high schools in 6 counties including Sui County, Yingshan, and Dangyang, 169 students have dropped out since the beginning of this semester (including a small number who dropped out due to economic difficulties and illness), accounting for 6.16% of the total number of students in the 6 schools, and this dropout phenomenon is continuing to develop.

In order to adapt to the needs of large-scale economic construction, the state is systematically cultivating construction talents. Randomly pulling students in school will inevitably disrupt the state's plan for cultivating talents, resulting in a waste of the state's human and financial resources. The correct way to solve the current problem of insufficient accountants in agricultural cooperatives should be to make good use of the senior elementary and junior high school graduates currently in the countryside. According to statistics from the Hubei Provincial Department of Education (excluding Wuhan City), from 1953 to 1955, there were 196,768 senior elementary school graduates in the province, of which more than 57% did not continue their education (only 1% participated in work); more than 30% of junior high school graduates also did not continue their education (less than 10% participated in work). This shows that senior elementary and junior high school graduates in the countryside still account for a considerable number. As long as we make good use of this force, the accounting staff of agricultural production cooperatives can be continuously replenished.

The CCP Hubei Provincial Committee has instructed Party committees at all levels to pay attention to fully exploring and using the strength of various educated youth currently in the countryside to solve the accounting problems of cooperatives. The phenomenon of randomly pulling students in school to take on accounting work must be stopped immediately.

    不要乱拉在校学生当合作社的会计
    维进
    目前，湖北省有些地方发生了乱拉在校学习的初中学生当农业生产合作社会计的现象。有的乡干部直接动员学生说：“你回来当会计，每月可以拿14元，马上可以入党。”有的社干部通过家长去动员学生，说：“住学要扛本（即付出各种费用），回去当会计1月可得30个劳动日，这多么好。住学将来毕了业还不是要回家生产！”更值得注意的是，有的地方党委也在抽调在校学生当会计。例如中共新洲县委曾指示县文教科在第一初级中学和第二初级中学各抽调50人到会计训练班受训（后经上级党委制止）。这种作法已经引起了某些学校学生的思想混乱，产生“迟退学不如早退学，迟当干部不如早当干部”等想法。据随县、英山、当阳等6县的6个初级中学统计，本学期开学以来退学的学生有169人（其中包括很少一部分人因经济困难和因病退学的），占6个学校学生总数的6.16％，而且这种退学现象还在继续发展。
    国家为了适应大规模的经济建设的需要，正在有计划地培养建设人材，乱拉在校学生必然会打乱国家培养人材的计划，造成国家的人力财力的浪费。解决当前农业合作社会计不足的问题的正确办法，首先应该是好好运用现时在乡的高小和初中毕业生。据湖北省教育厅统计（不包括武汉市），从1953年到1955年全省高小毕业生有196，768人，其中57％以上没有升学（参加工作的仅占1％）；初中毕业生也有30％以上没有升学（参加工作的不到10％）。这说明在乡的高小和初中毕业生还是占相当大的数量的。只要好好使用这批力量，农业生产合作社的会计员就可以不断地得到补充。
    中共湖北省委已经指示所属各级党委，要注意充分发掘和使用现时在乡的各种知识青年的力量，解决合作社的会计问题，乱拉在校学生担任会计工作的现象必须立即制止。
