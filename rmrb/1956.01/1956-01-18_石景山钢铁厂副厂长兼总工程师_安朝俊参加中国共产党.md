    An Chaojun, Deputy Director and Chief Engineer of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Joins the Communist Party of China
    The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party approved An Chaojun, Deputy Director and Chief Engineer of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, as a member of the Communist Party of China on the 12th. 31% of the engineers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have now been admitted into the Communist Party.
    In the old society, An Chaojun served as an engineer in several smelting enterprises. He once dreamed of saving the motherland by developing industry, but all his illusions were shattered.
    After the liberation of Beijing, An Chaojun was promoted from head of the Iron Smelting Department to Deputy Director and Chief Engineer. An Chaojun frequently received the Party's support and assistance in his work. He gradually came to understand the Party and became closer to it. In recent years, under his leadership, the plant has promoted a number of advanced Soviet experiences and implemented more than 500 suggestions from Soviet experts. Soviet experts praised An Chaojun as a "true Chief Engineer." In recent years, An Chaojun has persisted in studying Marxist-Leninist theory and advanced Soviet experiences despite his demanding work schedule. He is currently also studying Russian on his own.

    石景山钢铁厂副厂长兼总工程师
    安朝俊参加中国共产党
    中共北京市委员会12日批准石景山钢铁厂副厂长兼总工程师安朝俊为中国共产党的党员。石景山钢铁厂已有31％的工程师被吸收参加共产党。
    安朝俊在旧社会曾先后担任过几个冶炼企业的工程师，曾经幻想以发展工业来挽救祖国，但是一切幻想都破灭了。
    北京解放后，安朝俊从炼铁部的负责人被提拔为副厂长兼总工程师。安朝俊在工作中经常得到党的支持和帮助。他逐渐了解了党，更加靠拢党。几年来，在他的带领下，全厂推广了多项苏联先进经验，执行了500多项苏联专家的建议。苏联专家称赞安朝俊是“名符其实的总工程师”。几年来安朝俊在紧张的工作中仍然坚持学习马克思列宁主义理论和苏联先进经验，现在他还在自修俄文。
