    On the Land of Northern Vietnam
    By Zhan Chao, Our Correspondent in Vietnam
    On the land of Northern Vietnam, a vigorous patriotic production increase and economy practice campaign is in full swing. The working people are warmly responding to President Ho Chi Minh's call to strive for the victorious realization of the "1956 National Plan" on the basis of economic recovery in the past year.
    The "1956 National Plan" is an important part of the two-year economic recovery plan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam after the war (1955-1956). According to the plan's targets, by the end of 1956, the economy of Northern Vietnam will be basically restored to pre-war levels, while cultural and educational undertakings will be developed accordingly.
    What does "restoring to pre-war levels" mean? It means that in a short period of time, all the wounds left by the 15-year long war must be healed, and the agriculture, industry, and other economic undertakings of the North must reach the highest level in Vietnamese history - the level of 1939.
    This is a very arduous task that requires great effort to complete.
    As everyone knows, Northern Vietnam is very rich in natural resources. The famous Red River Delta is one of the two major granaries in Vietnam, and the coastal provinces and many river valley plains in the northern and northwestern mountainous areas are also very suitable for planting multi-season rice and other crops; forests are a huge wealth of Vietnam, with a total reserve of about 1.4 billion cubic meters, of which more than 75% are in the North; above the 17th parallel, thousands of kilometers of coastline and the Gulf of Tonkin provide good conditions for the development of fishing, salt, and other marine products; most of Vietnam's underground mineral deposits are distributed in the North, where there are more than 20 billion tons of the highest quality anthracite and bituminous coal, as well as non-ferrous and rare metals such as gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, zinc, antimony, nickel, tungsten, and manganese, as well as graphite, mica, and very rich phosphate deposits. In the past, Northern Vietnam has always been one of the main targets of plunder by French colonialists. Colonialists, like parasites attached to people, were desperately sucking the blood and sweat of the Vietnamese people, and infinitely exploiting the wealth of the Vietnamese people. In 1939, the total grain output was more than 4.2 million tons, the total coal output was more than 2.6 million tons, the total cement output was more than 305,000 tons, and the total yarn and cloth output was 6,940 tons and 3,650 tons.
    After the outbreak of World War II, Vietnam entered a long period of war. In the early days of the war, Japanese militarists invaded Vietnam; in 1945, as soon as the war ended, French colonialists, with the support of American and British imperialism, launched a war of aggression against Vietnam, which did not end until July 1954. The long war, which lasted for 15 years, severely devastated the already weak Vietnamese national economy and brought infinite pain to the Vietnamese people. Even now, the Vietnamese people still clearly remember the great famine of 1945. At that time, Japanese militarists and French colonialists colluded with each other, using guns to force people to remove rice from the fields and plant hemp, which they urgently needed, resulting in a tragic famine. At that time, more than 2 million people died of famine in Northern Vietnam.
    After the ceasefire, the Vietnamese people faced enormous difficulties. Due to the colonialists' long-term war of aggression, agricultural production in the North was greatly damaged, a large number of cattle were slaughtered, almost all important water conservancy and irrigation projects were destroyed, and the Red River Delta and many other places were full of large "no-man's lands," with more than 130,000 hectares of abandoned land. Similarly, the colonialists' war of aggression also left the industrial and mining production in the North in an extremely low state, especially after the restoration of peace, when the colonialists were about to withdraw to the South, they even more wantonly looted workers and transferred machines, in an attempt to paralyze the industrial and mining production in the North.
    However, difficulties cannot scare the heroic and hardworking Vietnamese people. From the first day of the end of the war, the people of Northern Vietnam, led by the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh, have been actively engaged in the arduous and heavy work of healing war wounds and restoring the national economy, and have achieved remarkable results. Especially in 1955, the first year of the two-year economic recovery plan, the agricultural production front in Northern Vietnam achieved a decisive victory. In this year, the farmers in the North not only resisted droughts, floods, insects, typhoons and other disasters that lasted for seven or eight months, but also achieved a bumper harvest in the autumn, with grain production increasing by 350,000 tons over the original plan. The output of some areas has reached pre-war levels, and some areas have even exceeded pre-war levels. According to the unit area yield of autumn rice, 1939 was the highest year before the war, with an average yield of 1,700 kilograms of rice per hectare, but this year, the Dabai Cooperative in Thanh Hoa Province averaged 2,350 kilograms of rice per hectare, and some farmers in the Baixia Cooperative in Ha Dong Province received as much as 4,040 kilograms of rice per hectare.
    The people of Northern Vietnam are striding into the second year of peaceful recovery - 1956 - with full confidence. In this year, they will restore the entire national economy of the North with the restoration and development of agriculture as the center. These days, the heart of the North - Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam - seems particularly busy. A series of professional meetings have been held one after another from the end of last year to the present. Cadres and labor models from all over the country have come to Hanoi, bringing with them various statistics, charts and materials, gathering in the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, people's organizations and government departments, solemnly examining the achievements, experiences and lessons of the past year, and conscientiously studying the specific tasks and indicators for the realization of the "1956 National Plan." Then they hurried back to their respective places. When saying goodbye, they made promises to each other and put forward the conditions for competition. These days, Hanoi's newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations are constantly reporting new good news from various production fronts from all over the country. A large-scale spring plowing and drought prevention movement is being launched on the vast fields of the North.

    在越南北方的土地上
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    在越南北方的土地上，声势浩大的爱国主义增产节约竞赛正蓬勃地开展着。劳动人民热烈响应胡志明主席的号召，要在过去一年恢复经济的基础上，为胜利地实现“1956年国家计划”而奋斗。
    “1956年国家计划”，是越南民主共和国战后1955—1956年两年恢复经济计划的重要组成部分。按照计划的指标，到1956年底，越南北方的经济基本上恢复到战前水平，同时并相应地发展文化教育事业。
    恢复“战前水平”的意思是什么？就是说要在短促的时间里，把15年长期战争遗留下来的创伤全部医治好，并且使得北方的农业、工业以及其他经济事业达到越南历史上最高的水平——1939年的水平。
    这是一项十分艰巨的任务，需要作极大的努力才能完成。
    谁都知道，越南北方的自然资源是非常丰富的。著名的红河三角洲是越南全国两大谷仓之一，而沿海各省和北部、西北部山区里的许多河谷平原，也都十分适宜于种植多季水稻和其他农作物；森林是越南一项巨大的财富，全部蕴藏量约有14亿立方公尺，其中75％以上在北方；17度线以上，上千公里的海岸线和北部湾，是发展渔、盐和其他海产的良好条件；越南地下矿藏绝大部分分布在北方，这里有藏量在200亿吨以上的最优质的无烟煤和烟煤，有金、银、铜、铁、锡、锌、锑、镍、钨、锰等有色金属和稀有金属，有石墨、云母和蕴藏量十分丰富的磷酸矿等等。过去，越南北方一向是法国殖民主义者的主要掠夺目标之一。殖民主义者就像附在人身上的一条寄生虫似的，在极力地吸吮着越南人民的血汗，无限度地榨取着越南人民的财富。在1939年，粮食的总产量是420多万吨，煤炭的总产量是260多万吨，水泥的总产量是305，000多吨，纱和布的总产量是6，940吨和3，650吨。
    第二次世界大战爆发后，越南从此转入长期的战争之中。大战初期，日本军国主义者的武装就侵入了越南；1945年大战刚一结束，法国殖民主义者又在美、英帝国主义的支持下发动了对越南的侵略战争，直到1954年7月才告结束。延续了15年之久的长期战争，严重地摧残了原来基础就很薄弱的越南国民经济，给越南人民带来了无限的痛苦。直到现在，越南人民还清楚地记得1945年的大饥荒。当时日本军国主义者和法国殖民主义者互相勾结，用枪杆强迫人民铲除田里的稻子，种植上它们所急需的黄麻，结果造成了惨绝人寰的大饥荒。那一次，越南北方竟有200多万人死于饥荒。
    停战后，越南人民面临着巨大的困难。由于殖民主义者长期的侵略战争，使北方的农业生产遭到极大的破坏，大批耕牛被屠杀了，几乎所有重要的水利灌溉工程都被炸毁了，红河三角洲和其他许多地方到处是庞大的“无人区”，荒废的田地在13万公顷以上。同样，殖民主义者的侵略战争，也使北方的工矿生产处在极其低下的情况，尤其是和平恢复后，当殖民主义者将要撤退到南方之前，它们更大肆劫运工人、转移机器，企图使北方的工矿生产陷于瘫痪状态。
    但是，困难是吓不倒英勇勤劳的越南人民的。从战争结束的第一天开始，越南北方人民就在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的领导下，积极地进行医治战争创伤和恢复国民经济各项艰巨而繁重的工作，并且取得了显著的成绩。特别是在执行两年恢复经济计划的头一年——1955年，越南北方农业生产战线上取得了一次决定性的胜利。在这一年里，北方的农民不仅抗击前后持续达七、八个月之久的旱、涝、虫、台风等灾害，并且在秋季里获得了一次大丰收，粮食比原计划增产了35万吨。有些地区产量已经达到了战前水平，有些地区甚至超过了战前水平。按照秋稻单位面积产量计算，战前1939年是最高的一年，每公顷平均收1，700公斤稻子，可是今年清化省大白社每公顷平均收2，350公斤稻子，河东省白夏社有些农户每公顷竟收到4，040公斤稻子。
    越南北方人民正满怀着信心跨进和平恢复的第二个年头——1956年，他们要在这一年里以恢复和发展农业为中心把北方的国民经济全部恢复起来。在这些日子里，北方的心脏——越南民主共和国首都河内显得特别地忙碌。一系列的专业会议，从去年年底到现在陆续不断地在举行着。各业干部和劳动模范们从各地来到了河内，他们随身携带着各种统计数字、图表和资料，集合在越南劳动党中央、人民团体和政府各部门里，严肃地检查过去一年的成绩和经验教训，认真地研究实现“1956年国家计划”的各项具体任务和指标。然后又急急忙忙地赶回各地去。在道别的时候，他们互相许诺，并且提出了竞赛的条件。这些日子里，河内的报纸、通讯社、广播电台每天不断地报道着从各地传来的各个生产战线上新的捷报，在北方广阔的原野上，正在掀起一个规模巨大的春耕防旱的运动。
