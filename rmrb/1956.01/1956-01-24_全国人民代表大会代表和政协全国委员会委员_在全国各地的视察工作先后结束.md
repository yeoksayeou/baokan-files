    National People's Congress Deputies and CPPCC National Committee Members
    Conclude Inspection Work Across the Country

    National People's Congress deputies and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference have successively concluded their inspection work in various parts of the country.

    Deputies and members inspecting work in Beijing spent over 40 days inspecting a total of 158 factories, farms, agricultural producers' cooperatives, shops, joint state-private enterprises, schools, hospitals, neighborhood committees, and political and legal departments. They put forward 477 opinions. Of these, 97 have been processed or are being processed by the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, and the remainder will be processed successively.

    The 82 deputies and members inspecting Shanghai this time inspected work in industry, commerce, agriculture, publishing, as well as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the courts, neighborhood committees, schools, and intellectuals. They went deep into 95 grassroots units, directly contacted more than 2,000 people from all walks of life, listened to their reflections on the implementation of national policies, and widely solicited the opinions and demands of the people. Among them, 62 deputies and members went deep into more than 40 joint state-private factories and shops for inspection.

    Deputies and members inspecting work in the vast rural areas of various provinces focused on inspecting the situation of agricultural production and agricultural cooperation. They were excited about the upsurge of agricultural cooperation in various places. Li Ming (Zhuang nationality), a National People's Congress deputy inspecting work in Guangxi Province, after inspecting Baise County in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, believed that a massive upsurge of agricultural cooperation was also taking place in minority areas. Da Xiafu and three other National People's Congress deputies inspecting work in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region also went to the Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture and the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture for inspection. Burhan, a National People's Congress deputy and vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, also went to the Aksu Prefecture in southern Xinjiang for inspection.
