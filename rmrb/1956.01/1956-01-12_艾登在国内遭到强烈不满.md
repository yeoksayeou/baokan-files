Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th: Many British newspapers have published articles in recent days fiercely criticizing Prime Minister Eden, attacking the Conservative government's failures in the Middle East and in dealing with domestic economic difficulties.

    The "People" newspaper reported on January 7th on the front page with a prominent headline: "Now more than half of the Conservative MPs are of the opinion that the sooner Eden resigns the better, because they believe Eden is a failure. They are worried because the government is facing increasingly fierce criticism."

    The "Daily Mirror" pointed out in a headline that "Eden is a failure."

    Some British newspapers have rumored that Eden may resign. The "Observer" said on January 8th that Eden may resign this summer.

    However, rumors about Eden's possible resignation have been officially refuted. According to Reuters, the Prime Minister's spokesman said that these rumors "are unfounded."

    艾登在国内遭到强烈不满
    据新华社10日讯  伦敦消息：英国许多报纸连日刊载猛烈批评首相艾登的文章，抨击保守党政府在中东和应付国内经济困难上的失败。
    “人民报”1月7日在第一版以显著的标题报道说：“现在有一半以上的保守党议员的意见是，艾登愈早辞职愈好，因为他们认为艾登是失败的。他们因为政府遭到日益激烈的批评而感到担心。”
    “每日镜报”在标题中指出“艾登是一个失败者”。
    某些英国报纸传说艾登可能辞职。“观察家报”1月8日说，艾登可能在今年夏天辞职。
    但是，关于艾登可能辞职的传闻受到官方的反驳。据路透社报道，首相的发言人说这些传闻“是毫无根据的”。
