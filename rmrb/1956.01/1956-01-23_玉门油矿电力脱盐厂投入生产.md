    Yumen Oilfield Electric Desalting Plant Goes into Production
    The large-scale electric desalting plant that Yumen Oilfield began constructing last year has recently gone into production. The Laojunmiao Oilfield of Yumen Oilfield is a water-drive type oilfield. Last year, large-scale artificial water injection was carried out in this oilfield, which strengthened the driving force of underground oil and greatly increased crude oil production. However, water injection into the oilfield increased the salt and water content of the crude oil, which brought some difficulties to the refining of finished products. After this electric desalting plant is put into production, it can reduce the salt and water content of petroleum and ensure a large increase in petroleum production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    玉门油矿电力脱盐厂投入生产
    玉门油矿去年动工兴建的大型电力脱盐厂最近投入生产。玉门油矿老君庙油田是水驱类型油田，去年在这个油田上用人工方法进行大规模注水结果，加强了地下石油的驱动力量，使原油产量大大增加。但油田注水以后却增加了原油的含盐含水量，给炼制成品带来了一些困难。这座电力脱盐厂投入生产以后，就可以降低石油的含盐含水量，保证石油的大量增产。　（新华社讯）
