Moscow dispatch from our newspaper on the 18th: Party congresses of the communist parties of various Soviet republics have begun. The agenda of the congresses includes: discussing the Sixth Five-Year Plan; listening to work reports from the republic's Party Central Committee and the Party Central Supervisory Committee; electing the Party's leading bodies; and electing delegates to attend the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of Ukraine opened in Kiev on the 17th. Among the delegates attending were many innovators in industrial and agricultural production, workers in science and culture, and Party and Soviet workers. Kirichenko, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, announced the opening of the congress. Members of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee were elected as honorary presidium. On the 17th, the congress discussed the draft directives of the CPSU Central Committee on the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Kalchenko, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian Republic, delivered a report on this issue. The congress unanimously passed a resolution expressing warm support for the draft directives. The congress charged the Party organizations at all levels in Ukraine to ensure that every worker is aware of the draft directives of the Five-Year Plan, to organize Party meetings and mass rallies to discuss this document, and to encourage workers to actively seek out unutilized potential in industry and agriculture in order to successfully realize the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

The 14th Congress of the Communist Party of Latvia opened in Riga on the 17th. The 9th Congress of the Communist Party of Estonia also opened in Tallinn on the same day. Both congresses heard work reports from the republic's Party Central Committee.
