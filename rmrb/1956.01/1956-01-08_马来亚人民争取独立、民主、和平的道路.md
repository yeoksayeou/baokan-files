　　The Road for the People of Malaya to Strive for Independence, Democracy, and Peace
    Jin Zhang

    On December 23, 1955, the Malayan Communist Party issued a declaration calling on all ethnic groups, strata, and political parties in Malaya to unite and fight for the realization of independence, democracy, and peace in Malaya; and put forward eight specific programs for achieving the above goals. This program correctly reflects the urgent aspirations and common interests of all ethnic groups in Malaya, and also points out a reasonable way to resolve the relationship between Malaya and Britain. It is in line with the current actual situation in Malaya, is a concrete application of Marxism, and is correct, and therefore can become a common program for all ethnic groups and strata in Malaya to strive for independence, democracy, and peace.

    The Malayan Communist Party is the most faithful defender of the interests of all ethnic groups in Malaya. Since its birth, for more than 20 years, it has been waging unyielding struggles for the national independence of Malaya and against colonialist oppression and plunder. During World War II, when the Japanese fascists invaded Malaya and the British army was defeated, the Malayan Communist Party raised the banner of resistance against Japan and, regardless of all difficulties and sacrifices, led the people of all ethnic groups in Malaya in a heroic struggle against the Japanese invaders for more than three years. The struggle of the heroic sons and daughters of Malaya made a great contribution to the victory of the anti-fascist war of aggression, and was praised and admired by the people of all Allied countries. Even the British authorities at the time publicly acknowledged this. However, after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the British colonialists returned, seizing the fruits of victory obtained by the bloodshed and sacrifice of the Malayan Communist Party and the people, restoring its colonial rule in Malaya, and even treating its allies in the anti-Japanese war as enemies. In 1948, Britain promulgated emergency regulations and launched a colonial war of full-scale attack on the Malayan people. The Malayan Communist Party and the people it led were forced to rise up and carry out armed struggle in order to strive for the national independence of Malaya. Obviously, the Malayan War was imposed on the Malayan people by the British colonialists. Its purpose is to maintain colonial rule, its commander is British, and its army is also mainly British. This war is a colonial war, and its nature has not changed to this day.

    The armed struggle waged by the Malayan Communist Party and the National Liberation Army against British colonialists has always been warmly supported and endorsed by the people of all ethnic groups in Malaya. Therefore, they have been able to continuously persist in the struggle even in extremely difficult environments and under conditions of disparity in strength. This profoundly reflects the firm and unwavering desire of the Malayan people for national independence. Now, the movement of the Malayan people to strive for independence has further expanded, and the call for a swift end to the colonial war is growing. They all hope to restore peace through negotiations between the two sides, to facilitate national unity in order to strive for the independence of Malaya. This proves that the colonialists' attempt to use war to extinguish the independence movement of the Malayan people is absolutely impossible.

    Under these increasingly unfavorable circumstances, the British colonialists realized that they could not continue to rule in Malaya in the old way. Therefore, in recent years, they have had to make some minor modifications in the way they rule, such as increasing the number of elected members of parliament and appointing locals as ministers. However, whether in the Federation of Malaya or Singapore, the British colonialists still control the power of national defense, diplomacy, and finance; moreover, the British High Commissioner or Governor still has the power to veto laws passed by the legislature. British colonial troops also continue to be stationed throughout Malaya and wage war against the Malayan people. Obviously, Malaya's status has not changed due to the British colonialists changing some of the ways they rule. Malaya has still not gained independence and is still a colony of British imperialism. Precisely because of this, the armed struggle waged by the Malayan Communist Party and the people, in the past and now, is a war for national independence and against colonialism.

    Even so, the Malayan Communist Party and the people have always advocated stopping the Malayan war through negotiations. The Malayan Communist Party made suggestions in 1951 and 1954, advocating negotiations on a fair and reasonable basis to reach a ceasefire agreement. However, the British colonial authorities took a cold attitude towards these peaceful proposals. Later, due to the rising movement of the Malayan people demanding peace and independence, the British colonialists were unable to prevent peace talks. In the recent talks held in Baling, northern Malaya, the Malayan Communist Party made its best efforts to achieve peace in Malaya. It also stated in the negotiations that it was willing to end hostilities and disband the armed forces when the government elected by the Federation of Malaya obtained full control over internal security and local armed forces. However, due to the obstruction of the policy already decided by the British colonial authorities before the negotiations, the situation of refusing to give the Malayan Communist Party equal status and insisting on so-called amnesty surrender conditions occurred. This prevented the meeting from reaching an agreement. According to reports, Rahman, the Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya who represented the Malayan authorities at this negotiation, told reporters from various countries after the negotiation that the Malayan Communist Party and the National Liberation Army were willing to achieve peace. As for Rahman himself, he was unable to do what he wanted in this negotiation. As fair-minded people in Malaya said: Rahman went to Baling with his hands tied, so the negotiation did not produce results. The failure of the Baling peace talks to reach an agreement and the failure to quickly restore peace in Malaya are entirely due to the obstruction and sabotage of the British colonialists. In fact, even before the start of the negotiations, the British colonial authorities announced that they would conduct large-scale aerial bombardment and ground bombardment of the Malayan National Liberation Army, and actively deployed military forces to prepare for a full-scale offensive. As soon as the negotiations ended, the British High Commissioner in Malaya clamored menacingly to fight to the end; the British colonial army and the Australian army launched a new full-scale offensive into the jungle area under the cover of armored vehicles, artillery, and aircraft. The purpose was obviously to poison the atmosphere of peace created by the Baling talks in Malaya. But despite this, people from all walks of life in Malaya still advocate and demand the resumption of peace talks in order to reach a ceasefire and strive for independence.

    The facts are very clear that although the various ethnic groups, strata, and political parties in Malaya have different political beliefs and political views, they have a common demand: to restore peace in Malaya and to seek the true independence of Malaya. Today, the only people who oppose the restoration of peace in Malaya and the attainment of independence are a small number of colonialists. Therefore, colonialists are the common object of struggle of all ethnic groups, strata, and political parties in Malaya. All ethnic groups, strata, and political parties in Malaya must unite closely and carry out a resolute struggle against colonialism in order to restore peace in Malaya and seek the common goal of Malayan independence. It must be recognized that unity is the guarantee of victory, especially in the struggle against British colonialists who are good at "divide and rule" and are good at creating internal contradictions. Without the unanimous unity of the people of all ethnic groups in Malaya, victory cannot be achieved. Internal strife among the people of all ethnic groups in Malaya will only benefit the colonialists, hinder the development of the national independence movement, and prolong colonial rule. Malaya's independence, democracy, and peace will not come automatically, nor can they be obtained by begging the colonialists. Only the people of Malaya uniting to wage a resolute struggle can win them. This is a truth that has long been proven in the struggle of all oppressed countries to strive for independence and freedom.

    The people of the world, the people of Asia, and the Chinese people have always been concerned about the fate of the Malayan people. The struggle of the Malayan people to realize Malaya's independence, democracy, and peace is just and should be victorious. As the Malayan Communist Party's declaration says, India and Burma have long been liberated from British colonial rule and have established their own independent countries, and Britain has also recognized their independence. The colonialists have no basis for not allowing the Malayan people to become the masters of their country.

    This program declaration of the Malayan Communist Party is the correct path to realize Malaya's independence, democracy, and peace. The Malayan people will surely warmly support this program. We believe that the struggle of the Malayan people will surely achieve final victory.

　　马来亚人民争取独立、民主、和平的道路
    今章
    马来亚共产党在1955年12月23日发表宣言，号召马来亚全国各民族、各阶层、各政党共同团结起来，为实现马来亚的独立、民主、和平而进行斗争；并且提出了为实现上述目标的八项具体纲领。这个纲领正确地反映了马来亚各族人民的迫切愿望和共同利益，也指出了解决马来亚和英国的关系的合理途径。它符合于当前马来亚的实际情况，是马克思主义的具体运用，是正确的，因而是可以成为马来亚各民族各阶层争取独立、民主、和平的共同纲领的。
    马来亚共产党是马来亚各族人民利益的最忠实的捍卫者。从它诞生的时候起，20多年来它一直为了争取马来亚的民族独立，反抗殖民主义的压迫和掠夺而进行百折不挠的斗争。第二次世界大战时期，当日本法西斯侵入马来亚，英国军队被打败的时候，马来亚共产党就高擎起抗日的旗帜，不顾一切困难和牺牲，领导马来亚各族人民对日本侵略者进行了三年多的英勇斗争。马来亚英雄儿女的斗争，对于反法西斯侵略战争的胜利作了很大的贡献，得到了各同盟国家人民的赞扬和钦佩，就是当时的英国当局也曾公开加以承认。可是，在日本侵略者投降以后，英国殖民主义者却卷土重来，夺取马来亚共产党和人民流血牺牲所得到的胜利果实，恢复它在马来亚的殖民统治，甚至把抗日战争中的同盟者当做敌人。1948年，英国更颁布紧急条例，发动了向马来亚人民全面进攻的殖民战争。马来亚共产党和它所领导的人民为了争取马来亚的民族独立，被迫起而进行武装斗争。很显然的，马来亚战争就是英国殖民主义者强加于马来亚人民的。它的目的是在于维持殖民统治，它的指挥是英国人，它的军队也主要是英国军队。这个战争是殖民战争，它的性质直到今天并没有改变。
    马来亚共产党和民族解放军所进行的反对英国殖民主义者的武装斗争，始终得到马来亚各族人民的热烈支持和拥护，因而它们在极端困难的环境和力量悬殊的条件下都能不断地坚持斗争。这就深刻地反映了马来亚人民要求民族独立的坚定不移的愿望。现在，马来亚人民争取独立的运动更加扩展，要求迅速结束殖民战争的呼声日益高涨。他们都希望经过双方的谈判来恢复和平，来便利于全民团结以争取马来亚的独立。这就证明殖民主义者想用战争来扑灭马来亚人民的独立运动是绝对办不到的。
    在这种越来越不利的情况下，英国殖民主义者认识到在马来亚不能照老样子统治下去，因此，近年来才不得不在统治方式上作了一些微小的修改，如增加了民选的议员和委任当地人担任部长等等。但是，无论在马来亚联合邦或者新加坡，英国殖民主义者都依然控制着国防、外交和财政大权；而且英国高级专员或者总督还有权否决立法机关所通过的法令。英国殖民军队也继续驻扎在马来亚全境和对马来亚人民进行战争。显然，马来亚的地位并不因英国殖民主义者改变一些统治的方式而有所变更。马来亚现在仍然没有获得独立，仍然是英帝国主义的殖民地。正因为这样，马来亚共产党和人民所进行的武装斗争，过去和现在都是争取民族独立和反对殖民主义的战争。
    虽然如此，马来亚共产党和人民一向还是主张以谈判方式停止马来亚的战争。马来亚共产党在1951年和1954年都曾提出建议，主张在公平合理的基础上进行谈判，达成停战协议。但是英国殖民当局对这些和平的建议，都采取不理的态度。后来由于马来亚人民要求和平与独立的运动更加高涨，英国殖民主义者才无法阻止和平谈判。最近在马来亚北部华冷举行的谈判中，马来亚共产党为实现马来亚和平已尽了最大的努力。它并且在谈判中表明，愿意在马来亚联合邦选举产生的政府一取得了对内部安全和本地武装力量的完全控制权的时候，就结束敌对行动，解散武装部队。但是，由于受到英国殖民当局在谈判前所已决定的方针的阻碍，以致发生了拒绝给予马来亚共产党以平等的地位，并且坚持所谓大赦的投降条件的情况。这就使会议不能达成协议。据报道，代表马来亚当局出席这次谈判的马来亚联合邦首席部长拉赫曼，在这次谈判结束后就曾向各国记者表示，马来亚共产党和民族解放军是愿意实现和平的。至于拉赫曼本人在此次谈判中却力不从心。诚如马来亚公正人士所说的：拉赫曼是绑着双手到华冷去的，因此谈判没有结果。华冷和平谈判的不能取得协议，马来亚的和平不能迅速恢复，完全是因为英国殖民主义者从中阻挠和破坏。事实上，就在谈判开始以前，英国殖民当局就宣布要对马来亚民族解放军进行大规模的空中轰炸和地面轰击，并积极部署军事力量，准备发动全面进攻。谈判刚一结束，英国驻马来亚高级专员就声势汹汹地叫嚣作战到底；英国殖民军和澳大利亚军队就在装甲车、大炮、飞机掩护下向丛林区发动了新的全面进攻。其目的显然是在毒化华冷谈判在马来亚所造成的和平气氛。但尽管如此，马来亚各界人士还是主张和要求重新恢复和谈以求达成停战，争取独立。
    事实非常清楚，尽管马来亚各民族、各阶层和各政党之间的政治信仰、政治观点有所不同，但是他们具有一个共同的要求：恢复马来亚的和平，求得马来亚的真正独立。今天反对马来亚恢复和平和获得独立的，只有一小撮殖民主义者。因此，殖民主义者是马来亚各民族、各阶层和各政党的共同斗争的对象。马来亚各民族、各阶层和各政党为了恢复马来亚和平、求得马来亚独立这一共同目标，就必须紧密地团结起来，同殖民主义进行坚决的斗争。必须认识，团结是胜利的保障，特别是同长于“分而治之”、善于制造内部矛盾的英国殖民主义者进行斗争，如果没有马来亚各族人民的一致团结，则胜利是不可能取得的。马来亚各族人民内部自相厮杀，这只会有利于殖民主义者阻碍民族独立运动的发展，延长殖民统治。马来亚的独立、民主、和平是不会自行到来的，也不是向殖民主义者乞求所能得到的。只有马来亚人民团结起来进行坚决的斗争才能把它们赢取到手。这是所有一切被压迫国家人民在争取独立自由的斗争中早已证明了的真理。
    世界人民、亚洲人民和中国人民一向关心马来亚人民的命运。马来亚人民为实现马来亚的独立、民主、和平而进行的斗争是正义的，是应该得到胜利的。正如马来亚共产党宣言所说，印度和缅甸早已从英国殖民主义的统治下解脱出来，成立了自己的独立国家，并且英国也承认了他们的独立。殖民主义者是没有任何根据不让马来亚人民成为他们国家的主人的。
    马来亚共产党的这个纲领宣言，就是实现马来亚的独立、民主、和平的正确道路。马来亚人民对这个纲领一定会热烈地拥护。我们相信，马来亚人民的斗争一定会得到最后的胜利。
