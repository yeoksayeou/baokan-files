Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 15th: All 105 sectors of private industry and commerce in Shenyang City fully implemented joint state-private ownership in the two days of the 14th and 15th. This includes 49 industrial sectors and 56 commercial sectors.

In the past two days, private industrial and commercial establishments in Shenyang were decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, and drums and gongs filled the air, celebrating joint state-private ownership. Yesterday, after more than 4,400 private industrial and commercial households in the Nanshi, Beiguan, and Shenhe districts were approved for joint state-private ownership, employees, capitalists, and their families were overjoyed, with some wearing big red flowers on their chests. In the afternoon, they held a parade to celebrate, and in the evening, they paraded with lanterns late into the night.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 16th: People from all walks of life in Shenyang City gathered today to celebrate the great victory of socialist transformation in the city.

Today, the streets of the city were colorful and bustling. At daybreak, workers and shop assistants from joint state-private enterprises, members of handicraft production cooperatives, suburban farmers, employees of state-owned enterprises, staff of government organizations, and students, totaling more than 400,000 people, gathered from all directions at various assembly points. Encouraged by the slogan "Production and Cooperation Go Hand in Hand," the members of the Nanshi District's Children's Car Craft Cooperative Group worked through the night on the 15th to rush-produce 7 children's cars as a gift to the conference. Today, they pushed these children's cars to participate in the celebration rally.

At the celebration rally, more than 1,000 representatives of workers, agricultural production cooperatives, handicraft production cooperatives, and industry and commerce formed a reporting team. Amidst the cheers of the crowd, they reported the good news to the responsible persons of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee. Then, Huang Oudong, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Liu Baotian, Deputy Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Shenyang, congratulated the conference and delivered speeches. Huang Oudong said in his speech that private industry and commerce in Shenyang City had fully implemented joint state-private ownership, handicrafts had basically achieved cooperation, and 85% of suburban farmers had joined agricultural production cooperatives. This achievement is great. He called on everyone to work together, improve production, develop the economy, fulfill the tasks assigned to Shenyang City by the state ahead of schedule and in excess, and strive to build a prosperous and happy socialist society.

After the meeting, a parade was held. Waist drum teams, stilt walkers, yangko dance teams, land boats, dragon lanterns, lion dances, and other entertainment programs organized by the masses were performed with abandon in the parade.

Today, the people of Shenyang City were immersed in a joyous atmosphere all day long.

This newspaper reports: At 2 pm on the 16th, after the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee approved the last batch of 42 private industrial and commercial sectors to implement joint state-private ownership, the entire city was immediately plunged into unparalleled jubilation. The streets and alleys were decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, and the sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers were continuous. More than 14,000 factories and shops wrote large characters on red paper to announce the news of their unit's approval for joint state-private ownership. The doors and windows of the shops were covered with big red slogans such as "Celebrating Joint State-Private Ownership."

The socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in Chongqing City was completed one year and eleven months ahead of the original plan. This is because, influenced by the greatly accelerated pace of agricultural cooperation in Sichuan Province and encouraged by the news that all capitalist industry and commerce in Beijing had implemented joint state-private ownership, industrialists and merchants in Chongqing actively requested the early implementation of joint state-private ownership.

In recent days, groups of industrialists and merchants, setting off firecrackers and beating gongs and drums, flocked to the Municipal Bureau of Industry and the Bureau of Commerce to submit applications. Some capitalists even proposed to invest off-the-books assets into the enterprises when applying. Chemical industry capitalists have decided to invest more than 100,000 yuan of off-the-books assets into enterprises. On the 14th, more than 11,000 family members of private industrialists and merchants in the city also held a conference in the Labor People's Cultural Palace to actively support the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry.

    沈阳重庆私营工商业全部公私合营
    新华社沈阳15日电　沈阳市私营工商业105个行业在14日和15日两天中，全部实行了全行业公私合营。其中工业有49个行业，商业有56个行业。
    这两天，沈阳市各私营工商业户门前，张灯结彩，锣鼓喧天，庆贺公私合营。昨天南市、北关、沈河3个区的4，400多户私营工商业户被批准公私合营以后，职工和资本家以及资本家家属都非常高兴，有的在胸前挂上了大红花。他们在下午举行了游行庆祝会，晚上又提灯游行到深夜。
    新华社沈阳16日电　沈阳市各界人民今天集会庆祝全市社会主义改造的伟大胜利。
    今天，全市各街道上五彩缤纷，热闹异常。天刚亮，公私合营企业的工人、店员和资本家，手工业生产合作社社员，郊区农民，国营企业的职工，机关团体的工作人员以及学生等共40多万人，就从四面八方汇集到各个集合地点。南市区的童车工艺合作组的组员在“生产、合作化两不误”口号的鼓舞下，15日通夜赶制了7辆童车，作为向大会的献礼。今天他们推着这些童车参加了庆祝大会。
    在庆祝会上，职工代表以及农业生产合作社、手工业生产合作社和工商界的代表共1，000多人组成了报喜队，在万众欢腾中，分别向中共辽宁省委员会、辽宁省人民委员会、中共沈阳市委员会、沈阳市人民委员会的负责人报喜。接着中共辽宁省委书记黄欧东，中共沈阳市委副书记、沈阳市市长刘宝田向大会贺喜，并且讲了话。黄欧东在讲话中说：沈阳市私营工商业已经全部实行公私合营，手工业基本实现合作化，郊区农民已经有85％加入了农业生产合作社，这个成就是伟大的。他号召大家今后要协力合作，搞好生产，发展经济，提前超额完成国家给予沈阳市的任务，为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义奋勇前进。
    会后举行了游行。由群众组织的腰鼓队、高跷队、秧歌队和旱船、龙灯、狮子舞等文娱节目，在游行队伍中尽情地表演。
    今天，沈阳市人民整天沉浸在欢乐的气氛中。
    本报讯　16日下午2时，在重庆市人民委员会批准了全市最后一批共有42个私营的工业和商业行业实行公私合营以后，全市立即卷入了无比的欢腾中。大街、小巷张灯结彩，锣鼓声、鞭炮声接连不断。14，000多家工厂、商店纷纷用红纸写上大字，把本单位被批准公私合营的消息公布出来。商店的门上、橱窗上贴满了“庆祝公私合营”等大红标语。
    重庆市私营工商业社会主义改造的速度比原来的规划提前了1年零11个月。这是因为重庆市私营工商业者在四川省农业合作化速度大大加快的影响下，在北京市资本主义工商业全部实行公私合营消息的鼓舞下，工商业者积极要求提早实行公私合营。
    连日来，成群结队的工商业资本家，燃放着鞭炮，敲锣打鼓地拥到市工业局和商业局递交申请书。有些资本家在申请时还提出要将账外资财投入企业。化工业资本家已经决定把10多万元的账外资财投入企业。14日，全市私营工商业资本家家属11，000多人，还在劳动人民文化宫举行了积极拥护全行业公私合营大会。
