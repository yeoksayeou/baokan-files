    In the current high tide of socialist transformation, especially the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, the ideological education of the vast number of employees in private industry and commerce must be greatly strengthened. The employees who originally worked in private enterprises are an important part of China's working class and are the main reliance for the country to realize the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Recently, the employees of private enterprises in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other cities have shown great enthusiasm in the high tide of socialist transformation, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. Facts have proven that to give full play to the role of employees in private enterprises in the overall public-private partnership of the entire industry, the key lies in educating employees to understand the state's policies and guidelines for the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and to clearly recognize the important responsibilities they should shoulder in this work.

    The vast majority of employees in private enterprises sincerely support the Party and the state's policies and guidelines for transforming capitalist industry and commerce, especially since the implementation of overall public-private partnerships in various places recently, which has been a great encouragement to them, prompting them to actively improve production and management. After the complete approval of public-private partnerships for all capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing, the city's more than 17,900 industrial and commercial households' employees assisted capitalists in basically completing the task of inventorying assets and verifying capital after the partnership within a short period of four days, and basically achieved "both production and partnership" without delay. However, because the Party and trade union organizations have been relatively weak in educating employees in private enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, some employees still lack a correct understanding of the policies and guidelines for transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and a small number of employees still have various concerns about the overall public-private partnership of the entire industry. Therefore, strengthening the political and ideological education of employees in private enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, has become an urgent task for the Party's grassroots organizations and mass organizations such as trade unions in various places.

    A few employees still hold skeptical or even resistant attitudes toward the Party and the state's policies for transforming capitalist industry and commerce. They only see some of the past illegal behaviors of the capitalists in their factories or stores or their negative performance in this public-private partnership, and they believe that it is fundamentally impossible to gradually transform them into self-reliant laborers. The task of Party organizations and trade unions, etc., is to educate employees with concrete facts so that they realize that in recent years, after the continuous education by the Party, the government, trade unions, as well as the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the political and ideological outlook of private industrialists and businessmen in our country has undergone great changes, and more and more capitalists are proactively approaching the Party and the People's Government, willing to accept the management of the state and the supervision of the working masses, and willing to accept the state's transformation of them. Especially recently, after industrialists and businessmen in various places listened to Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions and studied the documents of the Second Session of the First Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, their general reflection was that their ideological understanding had been improved and their future direction had been clarified, thus actively applying for public-private partnerships and promoting the high tide of the socialist transformation movement of capitalist industry and commerce. The Baida Cotton Weaving Factory, run by the Ji Muqing and Ji Zhenyuan brothers in Shanghai, was rated as a basically law-abiding household during the "Five-Anti" campaign. This time, in order to welcome the public-private partnership of the entire industry, they decided to sell 420 taels of gold that had been privately hidden for many years to the state, convert them into RMB, and invest them in the enterprise after convening a family meeting and obtaining unanimous agreement from the whole family, and expressed that they would transform themselves well in future work. After all capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing were transformed into public-private joint enterprises, many capitalists also voluntarily invested gold, silver, precious medicinal materials, and off-the-books real estate and money accumulated over many years into the enterprises to show their determination to accept transformation and take the socialist road. All of this shows that as long as the Party organizations, relevant departments of the government, and the masses of employees in various places correctly implement the Party's policies, proactively and actively provide private industrialists and businessmen with education and assistance, and strive to win over the vast majority of them to join us on the road to socialism, it is entirely possible.

    Some employees in private enterprises are not active enough in public-private partnerships because their enterprises have higher wages and benefits, or they are used to a free and undisciplined life, and they are afraid of lower wages and benefits and strict labor discipline after public-private partnerships, etc. These employees mainly lack the collectivist ideology of the working class, only seeing a small amount of immediate personal interests and not seeing the collective and long-term interests of the working class. To dispel these ideological concerns, on the one hand, it is necessary to explain to employees that the wages and benefits of some private enterprises are too high and extremely inconsistent, which are left over from the old capitalist enterprises and are a means used by capitalists to buy off employees after the national liberation. Therefore, after the implementation of public-private partnerships in enterprises, it is entirely necessary and correct to gradually make appropriate adjustments and changes to excessively high and low wages and extremely unreasonable welfare systems based on the principles of being conducive to production and management, strengthening unity within the employees, and appropriately taking care of the employees' lives. On the other hand, it is more important to use facts to show employees that because the joint reorganization of the entire industry has many obvious advantages, the production and management level of enterprises after the joint reorganization will definitely be continuously improved. With the improvement and enhancement of production and management, these enterprises can better serve the country and the people; at the same time, the working conditions of employees will be improved, and the living welfare of employees will be correspondingly improved. After the merger and joint venture of four small forging iron factories, such as Yu Yichang and Wang Changji in Shanghai, into the "Public-Private Joint Shanghai Machine Forging Iron Factory," the quantity and quality of products have been significantly improved compared with the private period in just over four months, and the collective welfare and labor conditions of employees have also begun to improve. There are many such examples. These show that the concerns such as fear of lowering wages and reducing welfare should not exist. Every employee should not haggle over personal temporary gains and losses, but should put the collective and long-term interests of the country and the people first at all times and in all places, which is the proper performance of the working class.

    In order to enable the political and ideological education of employees in private enterprises, especially small and medium-sized private enterprises, to be carried out regularly and in a planned manner, the key lies in strengthening the specific leadership of the city party committees, especially the city district committees. In the past, the educational work for employees in private small and medium-sized enterprises was relatively weak, which was certainly related to the fact that these enterprises were relatively scattered, most small factories and shops did not have Party organizations, and trade union organizations were not sound enough, but more importantly, this work lacked unified and strong leadership, and was often carried out in a scattered manner by the relevant departments of the Party committee propaganda department, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations. There were originally very few cadres in these departments, and they also had many central tasks, so they often squeezed out the educational work of employees; or they could only do it in coordination with the central work, holding some large report meetings. Recently, in order to adapt to the needs of the rapid development of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, cities such as Beijing and Tianjin, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, mobilized and organized forces from all sides to conduct widespread and planned publicity and education for employees. In publicity and education, they also universally adopted the method of combining large-scale reports with group discussions, discussions, parties, and visits, and invited many employees of enterprises that had already been in public-private partnerships to explain and answer questions based on the specific ideological conditions of the employees of the enterprises that were in the process of joining the partnership. This has played a great role in rapidly raising the socialist consciousness of employees, dispelling unnecessary concerns among the masses of employees, and giving full play to their enthusiasm and creativity in the overall public-private partnership and reorganization of the entire industry. These practices should be promoted. If all cities can adopt them universally based on their specific local conditions, the consciousness of the employees of the large number of small factories and shops will be rapidly improved, more activists and backbone elements will be cultivated more quickly among the masses of employees, and it will be more conducive to the needs of the high tide development of the socialist transformation movement of private industry and commerce in various cities.

### 在社会主义改造的高潮中加强对职工的思想教育

    在社会主义改造的高潮中加强对职工的思想教育
    在目前社会主义改造，特别是私营工商业的社会主义改造的高潮中，对于私营工商业的广大职工的思想教育工作必须大大地加强。原来在私营企业里工作的职工是我国工人阶级的重要组成部分，是国家实现对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的主要依靠。最近北京、天津、上海和其他城市的私营企业职工在社会主义改造的高潮中表现了巨大的积极性，这是非常可喜的现象。事实证明，要充分发挥私营企业职工在全行业公私合营中的作用，关键在于必须教育职工懂得国家对资本主义工商业改造的方针政策，明确地认识到他们在这个工作中应当担负的重大责任。
    绝大多数私营企业的职工，对于国家改造资本主义工商业的方针政策是热诚拥护的，特别是最近各地开始实行全行业的公私合营以后，对他们更是一个极大的鼓舞，推动了他们积极地改进生产和经营。在北京市的资本主义工商业全部批准公私合营以后，全市17，900多工商户的职工，在短短的4天内就协助资本家基本上完成了合营后的清产核资工作，并且基本上做到了“生产和合营”两不误。但是，由于过去党和工会等组织对私营企业职工、特别是中小企业职工的教育工作还比较薄弱，也还有部分职工对改造资本主义工商业的方针政策缺乏正确的认识，小部分职工还对全行业的公私合营有各种顾虑。因此，加强对私营企业、特别是中小企业职工的政治思想教育，就成了党的基层组织和各地工会等群众组织的一项迫切的任务。
    对于党和国家改造资本主义工商业的政策，还有少数职工抱着怀疑以至抵触的态度。他们只看见本厂或本店资本家过去的一些违法行为或在这次公私合营中的消极表现，就认为要把他们逐步地改造成自食其力的劳动者，是根本不可能的。党组织和工会等的任务，就在于用具体的事实来教育职工，使他们认识到：这几年来经过党、政府、工会以及民主建国会和工商联等组织的不断教育，我国私营工商业者的政治思想面貌已经有了很大的变化，越来越多的资本家主动地靠拢党和人民政府，愿意接受国家的管理和工人群众的监督，愿意接受国家对他们的改造。特别是最近各地工商业者听到了毛泽东主席对他们的指示，学习了全国工商联第一届执委会第二次会议的文件以后，他们普遍的反映是思想认识提高了，前途方向明确了，因而积极地申请公私合营，推进了资本主义工商业的社会主义改造运动的高潮。上海资本家季慕卿和季震元兄弟两人开办的百达棉织厂，“五反”时被评为基本守法户。这次为了迎接全行业的公私合营，他们在召开家庭会议取得全家一致同意之下，决定将私藏多年来的黄金420两卖给国家，兑成人民币投入企业，并且表示要在今后的工作中好好地改造自己。在北京市的资本主义工商业全部转变为公私合营的企业以后，也有许多资本家自动地把积存多年的黄金、白银、贵重药材和账外的房产和金钱投入企业，以表示他们接受改造、走社会主义道路的决心。所有这些都说明，只要各地的党组织、政府的有关部门和职工群众正确地贯彻执行党的政策，主动积极地给予私营工商业者以教育和帮助，争取他们中间的绝大多数人和我们一起走到社会主义，是完全可能的。
    还有部分私营企业的职工，由于他们所在企业的工资福利较高，或者过惯了自由散漫的生活，就怕公私合营以后降低工资福利，怕劳动纪律严格，等等，因而对公私合营不够积极。这些职工主要是还缺乏工人阶级集体主义的思想，只看见个人眼前的一点微小的利益，看不见工人阶级集体的和长远的利益。要解除这些思想顾虑，一方面是要向职工说明，部分私营企业的工资福利过高，而且极不统一，是旧的资本主义企业所遗留下来的，是全国解放后资本家用来买好职工的一种手段。因此，在企业实行公私合营以后，根据有利于生产和经营，加强职工内部的团结和适当照顾职工的生活等原则，对过高过低的工资和极不合理的福利制度逐步地进行适当的调整和改变是完全必要的和正确的。另一方面更重要的是要用事实向职工说明：由于全行业的合营改组具有许多明显的优越性，因而合营改组后的企业的生产和经营水平一定会得到不断的提高。而随着生产和经营的改进和提高，就能使这些企业更好地为国家和人民服务；同时职工的劳动条件也会有所改善，职工的生活福利也会有相应的提高。上海市的于义昌、王长记等四家小型锻铁工厂，在合并合营成“公私合营上海机器锻铁厂”以后四个多月，产品的数量和质量就比私营时期有了显著的提高，职工的集体福利和劳动条件也开始有了改善。像这样的例子还多得很。这些就说明了，那种怕降低工资和减少福利等顾虑是不应该有的，每个职工都不应当斤斤计较个人暂时的得失，而是应当随时随地把国家和人民的集体利益和长远利益摆在前头，才是工人阶级应有的表现。
    为了使私营企业特别是中小私营企业职工的政治思想教育工作能够经常地有计划地进行，关键在于加强城市党委、特别是城市区委的具体领导。过去对私营中小企业职工的教育工作所以比较薄弱，固然同这些企业比较分散，绝大多数的小厂小店没有党的组织，工会组织还不够健全等有关，但更重要的是这个工作缺乏统一的坚强的领导，常常是分散地由党委宣传部、工会、青年团等组织的有关部门来进行。这些部门的干部本来就很少，再加中心工作很多，因而常常把职工的教育工作挤掉了；或者只能做到配合中心工作，举行一些大报告会。最近，北京、天津等城市为了适应资本主义工商业社会主义改造迅速发展的需要，在党委的统一领导之下，把各方面的力量动员和组织起来，广泛地有计划地对职工进行了宣传教育。而在宣传教育中，又普遍采取了大会报告同小组的座谈、讨论、联欢和参观访问相结合的办法，并且邀请了许多早已公私合营的企业的职工，根据正在合营的企业职工的具体思想情况进行讲解和解答问题。这对迅速提高职工的社会主义觉悟，解除职工群众中的不必要的顾虑，充分发挥他们在全行业合营和改组中的积极性和创造性起了很大的作用。这些做法应该推广。如果各城市都能根据当地的具体情况普遍加以采用，就会使为数很多的小厂小店的职工的觉悟迅速提高，在职工群众中更快更多地培养出积极分子和骨干分子，更有利于各城市私营工商业的社会主义改造运动高潮发展的需要。
