Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 21st (TASS): The newspapers published a statement made by the Sudanese Foreign Minister, Charouk, who is currently in Cairo, to the Arab News Agency regarding the foreign policy of the Republic of Sudan.

    Charouk said that the Sudanese government will implement a policy of cooperation with all countries. He said: "Sudan is willing to be friendly with all countries, avoid participating in foreign alliances, and will try its best not to get involved in international conflicts."

    Charouk continued, due to its geographical location, Sudan should implement a policy that is in line with the interests of both Arab and African countries. He said that the principles stipulated in the resolutions of the Bandung Asian-African Conference are the basis of Sudan's foreign policy.

    When talking about the relationship between Sudan and Egypt, Charouk said: "There is nothing that would make us quarrel with Egypt. We have common interests that require us to cooperate with each other."

    Charouk emphasized that Sudan is interested in developing economic and trade relations with other countries, because the task of national development requires it.

    查鲁克说，苏丹政府将实行同一切国家合作的政策。他说：“苏丹愿意同一切国家友好，避免参加外国的联盟，并且将尽可能不卷入国际冲突。”
