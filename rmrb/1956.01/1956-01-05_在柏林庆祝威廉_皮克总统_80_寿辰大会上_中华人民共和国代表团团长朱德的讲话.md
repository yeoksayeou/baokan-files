Respected President Comrade,
Respected Comrades and Friends:

    The delegation of the People's Republic of China, bringing the sincere friendship and best wishes of 600 million Chinese people, congratulates Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, on his 80th birthday.
    Comrade Wilhelm Pieck is a beloved leader of the German people and a faithful friend of the Chinese people. The Chinese people sing with reverence the selfless and glorious struggle that Comrade Wilhelm Pieck has carried out for more than 60 years for the liberation of the German working class and the German people, for the defense of world peace, and for the progress of mankind. Even during the difficult years of the Chinese people's liberation struggle, Comrade Wilhelm Pieck showed great concern for the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, he devoted himself to establishing an unbreakable brotherly friendship between our two countries and gave enthusiastic support to the socialist construction of the Chinese people. The Chinese people, like the German people, have a warm love for Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, and they are proud to have such a faithful friend as President Wilhelm Pieck. Comrade Wilhelm Pieck is one of the founders of the glorious German Communist Party and the Socialist Unity Party, an outstanding activist and veteran of the German and international workers' movements, a long-tested Marxist, and a faithful student of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, and a comrade-in-arms of Stalin. Whether during the First World War, in the era of the Weimar Republic, in the years of Hitler's bloody rule, or in the struggle against the world's anti-fascist aggression, he has unremittingly defended the interests of the German people and all progressive people of the world with Bolshevik tenacity and self-sacrificing spirit. The glorious road he has traveled is the road to the victory of peace, democracy, and socialism for the German working class and the German people.
    After the great Soviet army liberated Germany, Comrade Wilhelm Pieck stood at the forefront of the struggle for a unified, peaceful, democratic, and independent German state. In October 1949, a new type of state in German history - a truly democratic and peace-loving Germany - was born. Comrade Wilhelm Pieck was honorably elected as the president of this Germany where the working people became the masters. He led the German Democratic Republic in carrying out a series of democratic and social reforms, launched a large-scale work of restoring and developing the economy, and achieved great successes in all aspects, thus laying a solid foundation for building socialism in the German Democratic Republic. At the same time, for the benefit of Germany's peaceful reunification and European security, he also led the German people in a resolute struggle against the Western countries' policies of splitting the German state, reviving German militarism, and dragging Germany into the Western aggressive bloc. Because of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck's outstanding contributions to the cause of the liberation of the German people and the struggle to defend world peace, he has won the trust and love of the German people and peace-loving people all over the world.
    Dear Comrades and Friends! Under the leadership of President Wilhelm Pieck and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the German Democratic Republic has become a strong fortress of all peaceful and democratic forces in Germany and an important factor in maintaining peace and security in Europe. Here, the rule of monopoly capital and Junkers landlords has been overthrown, and the factories, mines, and land that originally belonged to them have become the property of the people. A new state system has been established, the people are engaged in peaceful labor, and are educated in a spirit of peace-loving and internationalism, thus fundamentally eliminating the possibility of militarism's revival. The German Democratic Republic represents the lofty and progressive aspirations of all the German people. No force in the world can prevent the working people of the German Democratic Republic from advancing victoriously in their cause of building a new life. Those who refuse to recognize the existence of the German Democratic Republic are doomed to failure.
    Germany is the birthplace of scientific socialism and the great teachers of the world proletariat, Marx and Engels. The German people have long been known to the world for their great achievements in culture, science, technology, and art, and have made brilliant contributions to world civilization. After embarking on the path of peaceful and democratic development, the people of the German Democratic Republic have the opportunity to more fully express and develop their great creative power, and they will inevitably greatly surpass their past achievements. Therefore, the growth and strengthening of the German Democratic Republic is of great significance for striving for the peaceful reunification of Germany and maintaining peace and security in Europe and the world.
    Of course, there are still obstacles on the road ahead for the German people. Due to the obstruction and sabotage of Western countries, Germany is still artificially divided into two countries ten years after the end of the war. The American aggressive forces and their followers in Britain and France have abandoned the Potsdam Agreement and other international obligations they have undertaken on the German question. Violating the national aspirations of the German people and the interests of European security, they concluded the Paris Agreement, revived militarism in West Germany, and dragged West Germany into the aggressive North Atlantic military bloc, attempting to turn West Germany into a hotbed of new wars. This has made the solution of the peaceful reunification of Germany more difficult. Taking into account the new situation formed after the ratification of the Paris Agreement and the existence of two Germanys, the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic have put forward practical and feasible proposals for solving the German reunification issue, that is, to create external and internal conditions for the final solution of the German reunification issue by establishing a European collective security system, gradually eliminating opposing military blocs, and establishing an all-German committee to promote the rapprochement and cooperation between the two Germanys. However, this reasonable proposal was unreasonably rejected by the Western countries at the recent Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The proposals put forward by the Western foreign ministers were aimed entirely at sacrificing the social and political achievements already gained by the working people of the German Democratic Republic, reviving militarism in the whole of Germany, and dragging the whole of Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive group. Obviously, this conspiracy is resolutely opposed by the German people and all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, and therefore it is bound to be thoroughly defeated.
    The reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis is an inevitable trend in historical development, and no matter how the Western countries sabotage it, it cannot be stopped. The Four Foreign Ministers Conference once again proved that the solution of the German reunification issue is first and foremost a matter for the German people themselves. Only when all the German people unite and take their destiny into their own hands, is the peaceful reunification of Germany possible. Therefore, the gradual rapprochement and cooperation between the two Germanys, and the struggle of the German people for reunification, peace, and democracy, are of decisive significance.
    The German people are by no means alone in their struggle for the reunification, peace, and democracy of their motherland. With you are the great Soviet Union and the entire peace, democracy, and socialism forces. The sympathy and support of the people of the whole world are also completely on your side. As representatives of the Chinese people, we have a responsibility to declare to you that 600 million Chinese people are your faithful friends, and we will always stand with you. The Chinese people are deeply convinced that the just struggle of the German people for the reunification, peace, and democracy of their motherland will surely be victorious.
    Dear Comrades and Friends! The people of China and Germany have long had a deep friendship. Since the birth of the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China, our two countries have established brotherly relations of friendship and cooperation. In recent years, our two countries' mutual assistance and cooperation in politics, economy, culture, and other fields have greatly developed. In July 1954, our Premier Zhou Enlai visited the German Democratic Republic. At that time, the prime ministers of the two countries issued a joint communiqué affirming the brotherly friendship and mutual support between our two countries. Not long ago, a delegation of the government of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Comrade Grotewohl, paid a friendly visit to our country. During the visit, the government delegations of the two countries fully exchanged opinions on the current international situation and further development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, as well as other issues related to the common interests of the two countries, and concluded the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation Between the People's

    在柏林庆祝威廉·皮克总统80寿辰大会上
　　中华人民共和国代表团团长朱德的讲话
　　敬爱的总统同志，
　　敬爱的同志们和朋友们：
    中华人民共和国代表团，带着六亿中国人民的真诚友谊和最好愿望，祝贺德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克同志的80岁寿辰。
    威廉·皮克同志是德国人民敬爱的领袖、中国人民忠实的朋友。中国人民怀着崇敬的心情歌颂威廉·皮克同志在60年以上的长时期内，为了德国工人阶级和德国人民的解放、为了保卫世界和平和争取人类进步所进行的忘我的光荣的斗争。还在中国人民进行解放斗争的艰苦年代里，威廉·皮克同志就亲切地关怀中国人民的革命事业。在中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国成立以后，他又致力于建立我们两国之间的牢不可破的兄弟友谊，并且对于中国人民的社会主义建设给予了热烈的支持。中国人民如同德国人民一样，对于威廉·皮克同志怀着热诚的爱戴，他们以有威廉·皮克总统这样忠实的朋友而引以为荣。威廉·皮克同志是光荣的德国共产党和统一社会党的缔造者之一，是德国工人运动和国际工人运动杰出的活动家和老战士，是久经考验的马克思主义者，是马克思、恩格斯、列宁的忠实的学生和斯大林的战友。无论在第一次世界大战期间，在魏玛共和国时代，在希特勒血腥统治的年月里，或是在世界反法西斯侵略的斗争中，他都坚持不懈地以布尔什维克的顽强毅力和自我牺牲精神，为捍卫德国人民和全世界进步人类的利益进行了英勇的斗争。他所走过的光荣道路，就是德国工人阶级和德国人民争取和平、民主和社会主义胜利的道路。
    伟大的苏联军队解放了德国以后，威廉·皮克同志又在争取一个统一的、和平的、民主的和独立的德意志国家的斗争中站在最前列。1949年10月，德国人民历史上的一个新型的国家——真正民主和爱好和平的德国——诞生了。威廉·皮克同志光荣地当选为这个劳动人民成为主人的德国的总统。他领导德意志民主共和国进行了一系列的民主改革和社会改革，展开了规模宏大的恢复和发展经济的工作，并且在各方面都获得了巨大的成就，从而为在德意志民主共和国建设社会主义奠定了坚固的基础。同时，为了德意志的和平统一和欧洲安全的利益，他还领导德国人民以坚决的斗争，反对西方国家分裂德意志国家、复活德意志军国主义和把德意志拉入西方侵略集团的战争政策。由于威廉·皮克同志对于德国人民的解放事业和保卫世界和平的斗争做出了这样卓越的贡献，他赢得了德国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的信任和爱戴。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！在威廉·皮克总统和德国统一社会党领导下的德意志民主共和国，已经成为整个德意志和平民主力量的坚强堡垒，维护欧洲和平和安全的重要因素。在这里，垄断资本和容克大地主的统治被推翻了，原来属于他们的工矿企业和土地成了人民的财产，新的国家制度已经建立起来，人民进行着和平的劳动，并且受着爱好和平和国际主义的教育，从而根本上排除了军国主义复活的可能性。德意志民主共和国代表着全体德意志人民的崇高的和进步的愿望。世界上没有任何力量能够阻挠德意志民主共和国的劳动人民在他们建设新生活的事业中胜利前进。那些拒不承认德意志民主共和国存在的人们，是注定要失败的。
    德国是科学社会主义的创造者和全世界无产阶级的伟大导师马克思和恩格斯的故乡。德国人民早就以他们的文化、科学、技术和艺术的伟大成就闻名于世界，并且对世界文明有过光辉的贡献。德意志民主共和国人民在走上和平和民主的发展道路以后，就有机会更加充分地表现和发挥他们的伟大的创造力量，而且必然会大大超越他们以往的成就。因此，德意志民主共和国的成长和壮大，对于争取德意志的和平统一和维护欧洲及世界的和平和安全都具有重要的意义。
    当然，在德国人民前进的道路上并不是没有障碍了。由于西方国家的阻挠和破坏，在战争结束了十年以后的现在，德意志还被人为地分裂成两个国家。美国侵略势力和它们在英、法的追随者，背弃了波茨坦协定和在德国问题上所承担的其他国际义务。它们违反着德国人民的民族愿望和欧洲安全的利益，缔结了巴黎协定，在西德复活军国主义，并且把西德拉入侵略性的北大西洋军事集团，企图把西德变成新战争的策源地。这就使得德意志的和平统一问题的解决更加困难了。估计到巴黎协定被批准后所形成的新局面和两个德国存在的事实，苏联政府和德意志民主共和国政府曾经提出了切实可行的解决德国统一问题的建议，那就是通过建立欧洲集体安全体系、逐渐消灭对立的军事集团和成立全德委员会以促进两个德国的接近和合作，创造最后解决德意志统一问题的外部和内部条件。但是，这种合理的建议，在不久以前举行的日内瓦四国外长会议上，遭到了西方国家的无理拒绝。西方外长们所提出的建议，其目的完全是要牺牲德意志民主共和国劳动人民已经获得的社会和政治成果，在全德意志复活军国主义，并且把整个德意志拉进北大西洋侵略集团。显然，这种阴谋是德国人民和世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民所坚决反对的，因此，它必然要遭到彻底的失败。
    德意志在和平、民主基础上的重新统一，是历史发展的必然趋势，不管西方国家如何破坏，也是绝对阻挡不住的。四国外长会议又一次证明了，德意志统一问题的解决首先是德国人民自己的事情，只有全德意志人民团结起来，把自己的命运掌握在自己手里，德意志的和平统一才有可能。因此，两个德国的逐渐接近和合作，德国人民为统一、和平、民主所进行的斗争，就有着决定性的意义。
    德国人民在争取自己祖国的统一、和平、民主的斗争中，绝不是孤单的。同你们在一起的，有伟大的苏联和整个和平、民主、社会主义力量。全世界人民的同情和支持，也完全在你们这边。作为中国人民的代表，我们有责任向你们申明，六万万中国人民是你们的忠实朋友，我们将永远同你们站在一起。中国人民深信，德国人民为祖国的统一、和平、民主而进行的正义斗争是一定会胜利的。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！中德两国人民早就有着深厚的友谊。自从德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国诞生以后，我们两国就建立了兄弟般的友好和合作关系。几年来，我们两国在政治、经济、文化等方面的互助合作，都有了很大的发展。1954年7月，我国总理周恩来同志访问了德意志民主共和国。当时，两国总理曾经发表了肯定我们两国间的兄弟友谊和相互支持的联合公报。不久以前，以格罗提渥同志为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团，在我国作了友好访问，在访问期间，两国政府代表团曾经就当前的国际局势和进一步发展两国间友好合作关系以及其他有关两国共同利益的问题，充分地交换了意见，并且缔结了中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国友好合作条约、中德文化合作协定和中德关于植物检疫和防治农作物病虫害合作协定。所有这些，都进一步地巩固和发展了我们两国的友好合作关系。
    我们两国的关系中贯穿着相互信任和团结一致的精神。我们两国在各方面进行着互助，中国人民在进行社会主义建设的过程中，曾经得到并且正在继续得到德意志民主共和国政府和人民的巨大支持和帮助，请允许我在这里，代表中国人民和中华人民共和国政府，向你们表示衷心的谢意。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！我们代表团在你们这个友好的好客的国家里，受到了诚挚的接待，我们清楚地了解，这是德国人民对中国人民所表示的友谊和热爱。中国人民十分珍贵这种友谊，并且衷心地希望德意志民主共和国在统一社会党和威廉·皮克总统的领导下，在社会主义建设、在争取自己祖国的统一、和平、民主和在维护欧洲安全和世界和平的斗争中获得更大的成就。
    威廉·皮克总统万岁！
    德意志民主共和国万岁！
    中德两国人民的永恒友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
