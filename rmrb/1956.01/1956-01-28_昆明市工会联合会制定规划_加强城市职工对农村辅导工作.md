Kunming Federation of Trade Unions Formulates Plan
    Strengthen Urban Workers' Guidance to Rural Areas
    The Kunming Federation of Trade Unions has formulated a preliminary plan to strengthen the guidance of urban workers to rural areas.
    This plan has delineated the scope of contact between 85 grassroots trade union organizations and 58 townships in the suburbs of the city. At present, trade union organizations at all levels are making preparations for visiting the countryside during the Spring Festival. During the Spring Festival celebrations, these trade union organizations will sign contact contracts with agricultural cooperatives respectively.
    The plan proposes that, in addition to launching socialist competitions to ensure the comprehensive and over-fulfillment of national plans to support agricultural production, urban workers should regularly and systematically strengthen their guidance to rural areas. This guidance work includes organizing technicians to repair agricultural machinery and production tools for farmers in their spare time, publicizing and helping farmers use new-style agricultural tools, assisting farmers in accumulating fertilizer, planting trees, and building water conservancy projects, organizing workers to help farmers with plowing and harvesting, organizing enterprise accountants to help agricultural production cooperatives train accounting personnel, and helping rural areas carry out cultural education and recreational activities, etc. (Xinhua News Agency)

    昆明市工会联合会制定规划
    加强城市职工对农村辅导工作
    昆明市工会联合会作出了加强城市职工对农村辅导工作的初步规划。
    这个规划划定了85个工会基层组织同市郊58个乡的联系范围。现在各级工会组织正在进行春节访问农村的准备。这些工会组织将在春节联欢中，分别同农业合作社签订联系合同。
    规划中提出，城市职工除了开展社会主义竞赛，保证全面超额地完成国家计划来支援农业生产外，应该经常有计划地加强对农村的辅导工作。这些辅导工作，包括组织技术人员利用业余时间为农民修理农业机器和生产工具，向农民宣传和帮助农民使用新式农具，协助农民积肥、植树和兴修水利，组织职工帮助农民耕种和收割，组织企业会计人员帮助农业生产合作社训练会计人员，和帮助农村开展文化教育和娱乐活动等。（新华社）
