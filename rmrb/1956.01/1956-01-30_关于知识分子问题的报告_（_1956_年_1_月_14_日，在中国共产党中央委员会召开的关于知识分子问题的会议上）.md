To strengthen the Party's leadership over intellectuals and over the entire scientific and cultural work, the Central Committee has decided to convene a meeting to discuss the issue of intellectuals. This decision by the Central Committee is part of the Party's overall struggle against conservative thinking and to fulfill the tasks of the transitional period.

Everyone knows that in 1955, based on the initiative of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Party Central Committee conducted a series of struggles against right-wing conservative thinking within the Party. The most important result of these struggles is that the campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries has been systematically and thoroughly carried out within institutions and society, and it is expected to be basically completed nationwide within the next two years. The agricultural cooperativization movement, based on the rapid growth of mass awareness, has made rapid progress, and this year it is expected to be basically completed nationwide with semi-socialist cooperativization and is moving towards full socialist cooperativization. The full industry-public joint management of capitalist industry and commerce is rapidly developing, and it is also very likely to be basically completed nationwide this year. The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy will be completed ahead of schedule and in excess, with some production sectors expected to complete the 1957 production plan in 1956, and other sectors also having the possibility of completing the five-year plan ahead of schedule and in excess.

All these great and inspiring achievements were unimaginable just a year ago; if we had not launched the struggle against right-wing conservative thinking, these achievements would still be impossible to achieve now. This shows how serious the harm of right-wing conservative thinking within our Party is.

The basic requirement of the struggle against right-wing conservative thinking is to strengthen and develop the people's democratic dictatorship, to complete the socialist transformation ahead of schedule, to exceed the state industrial development plan, and to accelerate the technological transformation of the national economy. This struggle has significant global implications. In our country with a population of six hundred million, if we can complete and accelerate these tasks ahead of schedule, and complete and carry out these tasks more, faster, better, and more economically, it will greatly strengthen the entire socialist camp, making it more conducive to our efforts to prevent the outbreak of new wars. If the mad invaders dare to launch a new war, we will also be in a more powerful position. Therefore, the Party Central Committee has decided to make the struggle against right-wing conservative thinking the central issue of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, requiring the entire Party to launch this struggle in all work departments.

The issue of intellectuals is raised on this basis.

What is the relationship between the issue of intellectuals and our current task of accelerating socialist construction?

The reason we want to build a socialist economy is ultimately to meet the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of society to the greatest extent possible. To achieve this goal, we must continuously develop the productive forces and continuously improve labor productivity, and we must continuously increase and improve socialist production on a highly technological basis. Therefore, in the socialist era, more than in any other era, it is necessary to fully improve production technology and to fully develop science and utilize scientific knowledge. Therefore, to develop socialist construction in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical, in addition to relying on the active labor of the working class and the broad masses of peasants, we must also rely on the active labor of intellectuals, that is, we must rely on the close cooperation of physical labor and mental labor, and the alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. The various construction projects we are currently undertaking are increasingly in need of the participation of intellectuals. For example, if we want to find minerals, we need a group of geologists to lead a large number of university and high school graduates to various remote and desolate areas to conduct surveys, general investigations, detailed investigations, and drilling. If we want to build mines, factories, railways, and water conservancy projects, we need a group of engineers and a large number of technicians to conduct surveys, design, construction, and installation. The production of factories, from product design to final product inspection, requires a certain number and level of technical personnel. The management of industry and commerce increasingly requires various specialized knowledge. To build a modern national defense, various scientific experts are needed. Without teachers and doctors, we cannot have schools and hospitals. Without cultural and artistic workers, we cannot have cultural life. In rural areas, after achieving agricultural mechanization and electrification, a large number of agricultural machinery engineers, power station engineers, agronomists, accountants, etc., will certainly be needed; even at present, to implement the projects that need to be started immediately in the draft outline for agricultural development from 1956 to 1967, such as the production of new-style animal-drawn agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, and water pumps, the elimination of major pests and diseases, the elimination of serious human diseases and livestock epidemics, it is necessary to rely on the active participation of scientific and technological workers, plant protection experts, medical workers, and veterinarians. Therefore, intellectuals have become an important factor in all aspects of our country's life. And correctly solving the issue of intellectuals, fully mobilizing and giving full play to their strengths, and serving the great cause of socialism, has also become an important condition for us to fulfill the tasks of the transitional period. The various departments of our Party and the various levels of Party organizations should attach importance to this issue.

What is the current issue of intellectuals? The fundamental issue at present is that the strength of our intellectuals, whether in terms of quantity, professional level, or political awareness, is not sufficient to meet the rapidly developing needs of socialist construction; and some irrational phenomena in our current use and treatment of intellectuals, especially the sectarian sentiments of some comrades towards non-Party intellectuals, to a considerable extent hinder the full play of the existing strengths of intellectuals. We must strengthen our leadership, overcome shortcomings, and take a series of effective measures to fully mobilize and give full play to the existing strengths of intellectuals, continuously improve their political awareness, cultivate new forces on a large scale to expand their ranks, and as quickly as possible improve their professional level to meet the country's growing needs for intellectuals. This is the fundamental task of our Party in the issue of intellectuals at present.

To discuss the task of the Party in the issue of intellectuals, we must first examine the current situation of intellectuals.

Our Party has always attached importance to the issue of intellectuals. As early as 1939, the Party Central Committee, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, adopted a decision to absorb a large number of intellectuals and effectively implemented it in various anti-Japanese base areas. After the liberation of the whole country, the Party implemented a policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals nationwide. The Party Central Committee believed: the revolution needs to absorb intellectuals, and construction especially needs to absorb intellectuals. In particular, because pre-liberation China was a culturally and scientifically backward country, we must be good at fully utilizing the historical heritage left over from the old society, making them serve the socialist construction of our country. The Party Central Committee also believed: the intellectuals of the old era, although influenced by imperialism and the reactionary classes in the past, were also subjected to the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang, so a part of them participated in the revolution, a part sympathized with the revolution, and the majority took a neutral and wait-and-see attitude towards the revolution, with only a small number being counter-revolutionaries. Facts increasingly proved to Chinese intellectuals that they had no other way out except to join the working class and the Communist Party. Therefore, uniting with intellectuals is necessary and completely possible. Based on this understanding, the Party Central Committee adopted the policy of "taking them all in" for the intellectuals of the old era, continuing to give appropriate work to the vast majority, and even assigning responsible work to a part of them; for the originally unemployed intellectuals, efforts were also made to help them find jobs or make other appropriate arrangements. In the political sphere, the Party gave many representatives of intellectuals their due positions. The Party Central Committee believed: the intellectuals of the old era must be helped to undergo self-transformation, to abandon the ideas of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, and to accept the ideas of the working class. For this purpose, the Party took a series of steps. The Party organized them to participate in land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, aid to Korea, the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" campaigns, visits to factories and villages, visits to the Soviet Union, participation in various international activities, leading them to study the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, criticize bourgeois idealist viewpoints, and conduct struggles against the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng clique and other counter-revolutionaries, and on this basis, carry out criticism and self-criticism. In terms of professional work, the Party also took many steps to help them master the principle of combining theory with practice, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve work methods, and enhance professional abilities. The vast majority of them have already become state cadres, already serving socialism, and already a part of the working class. While uniting, educating, and transforming old intellectuals, the Party also devoted considerable effort to cultivating a large number of new intellectuals, among whom there is already a considerable number of intellectuals of labor class origin. Due to all this, the face of China's intellectual community has undergone fundamental changes in the past six years.

Regarding the current political situation of intellectuals, many units have conducted statistics. These statistics show: among senior intellectuals, those who actively support the Communist Party and the people's government, actively support socialism, and actively serve the people, account for about 40%; those who support the Communist Party and the people's government, generally can complete tasks, but are not politically active, also account for about 40%. The two parts together account for about 80%. Outside this 80%, those who lack political awareness or oppose socialism in their thoughts account for about 10%, and counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements account for a few percent.

Compared with the early days of liberation, this change is very rapid. For example, according to statistics from four universities in Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao on 141 teachers, in the past six years, the number of progressive elements has increased from 18% to 41%, and the number of backward elements has decreased from 28% to 15%. Many intellectuals, in the face of China's great cause of socialist transformation and construction, cannot but be increasingly influenced and see the fate of the entire nation and their own closely connected in the new birth of China.

It should be noted here that the ideological state of intellectuals is not completely consistent with their changes in political and social status. Many progressive elements still have varying degrees of bourgeois idealism and individualism in their thinking, let alone the intermediate elements. In addition, many units have slow changes among their intellectuals, especially among the more backward parts, which also reflects that we have done little work among them.

The ranks of intellectuals have also expanded rapidly in the past six years. Currently, the estimated number of senior intellectuals in scientific research, education, engineering technology, health, culture and arts, and other fields nationwide is about 100,000, of which the number increased after liberation, according to some statistical materials, accounts for about one-third. Some sectors have increased particularly rapidly. For example, the number of geologists at the beginning of liberation was less than 200, but in 1955, according to statistics from the four departments of geology, heavy industry, petroleum industry, and coal industry, the number of engineers alone has already increased to 497, and the number of technical personnel graduated from colleges and universities has reached 3,440.

In the six years since liberation, the number of graduates from colleges and universities nationwide has reached 217,900. Although they do not all meet the standard of senior intellectuals we mentioned, they are the new forces in the intellectual community and the reserve army of experts. Moreover, it should be pointed out that many young people, although not yet experts in terms of rank, have already undertaken the work of experts and generally performed well. Among the 42,000 teaching staff in colleges and universities, professors and associate professors account for 17.8%, lecturers account for 24%, and assistant lecturers account for 58.2%, and some assistant lecturers are now participating in teaching. The situation in the engineering field is the same. There are only 31,000 engineers of all levels nationwide, but there are 63,600 technical personnel graduated from colleges and universities, and many of them are actually undertaking the work of engineers, and some of them should have been promoted to engineers long ago. In addition to this, as the reserve army of senior intellectuals, there is also a broad army of other intellectuals, who are constantly improving their knowledge level in the process of actual work and self-study in their spare time.

There is no strict boundary between senior intellectuals and general intellectuals. Now, just looking at the statistics of the five aspects of scientific research, education, engineering technology, health, and culture and arts, there are 3.84 million intellectuals in total. They are a great force in the cause of socialist construction. Correctly estimating and using these intellectuals, and helping them to make continuous progress in politics and professional skills in a planned way, is an extremely important task for the Party and the state. In my report, although the discussion focuses on issues related to senior intellectuals, most of the principles are also applicable to general intellectuals.

As mentioned above, China's intellectuals have now become a very large force. However, our country is so large, and our construction cause is developing so fast, and it will develop even faster in the future, so we must expand the ranks of intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, faster to meet the urgent needs of socialist construction. It should be admitted that there are still many shortcomings in our work of cultivating and promoting new forces, and these shortcomings hinder the faster expansion of the ranks of intellectuals.

The professional level of China's intellectuals has also been significantly improved in the past six years. Colleges and universities nationwide have carried out teaching reforms, established many new departments and majors that did not exist before nationwide, compiled and translated a large number of textbooks, and improved the quality of teaching. The scientific and technological community nationwide has done a great deal of work in geological exploration, basic construction design and construction, new product design and trial production, and has achieved remarkable results. As a result of efforts to learn from the Soviet Union, the engineering community in China has now learned many modern designs and constructions of factories, mines, bridges, and water conservancy projects, and the ability to design large-scale machinery, locomotives, and ships has also been greatly improved. From 1952 to 1955, the number of new mechanical products successfully trial-produced has reached about 3,500, and a few have reached the world level. In metallurgy, China can now smelt 240 kinds of high-quality steel and alloy steel; the utilization coefficient of China's blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces has reached the level of the Soviet Union in 1952. In theoretical science, China's achievements in some fields of mathematics, physics, organic chemistry, and biology have also been recognized by the world scientific community, and some of them have already contributed to production practice.

However, overall, China's science and technology are still very backward. Not only have we not been able to master and utilize many of the latest achievements of world science, but even many of the complex technical problems in China's current construction, we still cannot solve independently without the help of Soviet experts. However, until recently, we have not made a comprehensive plan for improving China's scientific and technological level; even the existing forces have not been fully and effectively utilized. The backwardness of technical science is inseparable from the weakness of the theoretical science foundation, and it is precisely in the field of scientific research that we have invested the least effort.

From the above simple description, it can be seen: our achievements are great, but there are still many shortcomings.

So, what policy should we adopt in the issue of intellectuals? What tendencies should we prevent and correct?

The main tendency in the issue of intellectuals at present is sectarianism, but at the same time, there is also a tendency of complacency and indulgence. The former tendency is: underestimating the great progress of the intellectual community in politics and professional skills, underestimating their important role in China's socialist cause, not recognizing them as a part of the working class, thinking that after all, production relies on workers, and technology relies on Soviet experts, and therefore not seriously implementing the Party's policy on intellectuals, not seriously studying and solving problems related to intellectuals; indifferent to how to fully mobilize and give full play to the strengths of intellectuals, how to further transform intellectuals, expand the ranks of intellectuals, and improve the professional level of intellectuals, etc. The latter tendency is: only seeing the progress of the intellectual community and not seeing their shortcomings, overestimating them, blindly trusting them without distinction, and even not being vigilant against bad elements, and therefore not carrying out educational and transformational work on them, or although seeing their shortcomings, but due to various inappropriate concerns, not daring to carry out educational and transformational work on them. These two tendencies are opposite in form, but the actual result is the same kind of right-wing conservatism, both of which are abandoning leadership, lacking a spirit of active struggle, and both hinder us from correctly solving the issue of intellectuals and scientific and cultural issues, and both hinder the development of China's socialist cause.

We must oppose these two incorrect tendencies at the same time. We should neither ignore the existing strengths of the intellectual community nor be satisfied with them; we should neither rely on Soviet experts indefinitely nor relax learning the most advanced science and technology from the Soviet Union and other countries. The only correct policy we should adopt is: in order to make China's socialist construction cause proceed in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical, we must make every effort to fully mobilize and give full play to the existing strengths of intellectuals, and at the same time, make every effort to transform, expand, and improve them as quickly as possible, so that the speed and scale of this transformation, expansion, and improvement can truly match the giant steps of the great development of all aspects of our country.

To fully mobilize and give full play to the existing strengths of intellectuals, it is not only necessary for the current tense construction cause, but also a prerequisite for further transforming, expanding, and improving the intellectual community.

Generally speaking, intellectuals have been mobilized on a large scale under the leadership of our Party. Otherwise, the great progress of intellectuals we mentioned earlier, and their great contributions to the country, would be unimaginable. We must first affirm this, which is the main aspect of the matter.

However, there are indeed many shortcomings in our work, including some serious ones. In the current high tide of socialist construction and transformation, we need to strengthen our leadership and quickly overcome these shortcomings to more fully mobilize and give full play to the strengths of intellectuals.

To fully mobilize and give full play to the strengths of intellectuals, first, we should improve their use and arrangement, so that they can give full play to their expertise beneficial to the country.

In the use and arrangement of intellectuals, we have done well in most cases. Many intellectuals have undertaken many important tasks in national construction, and their abilities have also been continuously improved in practice.

However, we cannot say that we have used and arranged intellectuals appropriately and have not wasted any strength. For example, in many agencies, due to inappropriate work distribution or poor work organization, there are still cases where a few intellectuals are "bored to death," and these intellectuals are often precisely because they have some specialized knowledge that they are assigned to these agencies. This phenomenon of wasting the country's most precious resources must be eliminated. Again, in colleges and universities nationwide, there are still a few teachers who have not been assigned courses. Some of these people are not necessarily unable to teach, or just need to organize them to study a little and they can teach, so they should be assigned courses; if they are really unable to teach, they should be assigned work that they can undertake, such as editing and translation work, publishing work, library work, etc., and not let them be idle. Again, in society, there are still a few unemployed intellectuals with considerable labor power, and they should be assigned appropriate work according to the situation, either by local authorities or by the central authorities.

In some places, there is still the phenomenon of using intellectuals inappropriately in their arrangement and use. Some scientists, who are willing to engage in scientific research work and believe that it is most beneficial to the country, are assigned to administrative work in agencies or administrative work in schools. There are also some experts who, due to errors in work distribution, are completely unreasonably assigned to work that they have not studied, sometimes today they are asked to do this, and tomorrow they are asked to do that, but they are not allowed to return to their original field. According to statistics from the Fourth Office of the State Council on five units under the Ministry of Light Industry, this situation of using non-specialized skills in senior intellectuals accounts for about 10%, which is a serious loss! We must take decisive steps to correct this bureaucratic, sectarian, and departmentalist error in the treatment of talents, so as to use specialized talents in the most needed places.

To fully mobilize and give full play to the strengths of intellectuals, second, we should have a full understanding of the intellectuals we use, give them the trust and support they deserve, so that they can actively carry out their work.

Intellectuals are generally satisfied with the trust and support we have given them, but we should still see the shortcomings in our work. In the issue of trusting intellectuals, as mentioned earlier, one tendency is to trust them too much without distinction in politics and professional skills, to the extent of telling some unrelated people or unreliable people some state secrets without necessity, or to overuse some completely unqualified people, causing work to suffer losses. This situation exists and must be corrected. Another tendency is not to give them the trust they deserve, for example, not allowing them to go to factories they can go to, or not allowing them to see materials they can see. This situation also exists and must be corrected. State secrets must be unconditionally kept, and any relaxation is not allowed; the issue is to correctly draw the boundary of secrets and not arbitrarily expand the scope of secrets, causing work to suffer losses and workers to encounter difficulties. At the same time, we should have a correct estimate and understanding of the history of intellectuals to avoid some people being suspected for a long time due to "complex history." Now, many senior intellectuals have a relatively complex history, which is not surprising. However, only a few people have political problems, and only a very few people have current political problems. Many intellectuals with historical problems that have not been concluded are due to the lack of serious and responsible efforts by leading comrades to clarify their problems, resulting in the long-term delay of the problems. We should concentrate relatively strong forces, distinguish between light and heavy, urgent and not urgent, and clear up their pending cases as quickly as possible to facilitate their use in the future.

Non-Party intellectuals, in addition to deserving trust, also deserve support. This means that they should have positions and power, their opinions should be respected, their professional research and work results should be valued, academic discussions in socialist construction should be encouraged and promoted, and their inventions and creations should be given the opportunity to be tested and promoted. There are a few Party members who do not respect their superior non-Party intellectuals, and this situation we should be responsible for correcting.

The lack of trust and support for some intellectuals is the main manifestation of sectarianism in the issue of intellectuals among some of our comrades. Many comrades are still not used to consulting with non-Party intellectuals on matters and giving timely guidance and help before the matter. Some comrades even adopt an attitude of respect but keeping a distance towards non-Party intellectuals. In this way, both sides lack understanding and easily form a rift. However, they are important personnel of our country, and their work performance directly affects national construction, so we have the responsibility to learn to approach them with a comradely attitude, correctly understand them, and thus give them guidance and help, so that they can play an active role in their work.

To fully mobilize and give full play to the strengths of intellectuals, third, we should provide intellectuals with necessary working conditions and appropriate treatment.

The working conditions and treatment of intellectuals have been greatly improved compared to before liberation. However, as mentioned earlier, there are still some urgent problems to be solved in this regard.

In the working conditions of intellectuals, a current important issue is that many of them cannot effectively control their working time. Many intellectuals feel that they spend too much time on non-professional meetings and administrative affairs, and these meetings and many affairs can actually be done without them. Almost the more famous scientists, writers, and artists, the more time they are occupied by various meetings, affairs, and social activities, which is a serious phenomenon on China's cultural front. The Central Committee believes that it is necessary to ensure that they spend at least six-tenths of their working days (i.e., 40 hours per week) on their own professional work, and the remaining time can be used for political study, necessary meetings, and social activities. This requirement should be firmly implemented. Intellectuals participating in social activities is beneficial, but the current shortcoming is that these activities are often concentrated on a few people. In the future, we should make adjustments to enable as many people as possible to participate, and these activities should not be a burden on everyone. Many experts have too many concurrent jobs, and this should be adjusted as soon as possible.

Some intellectuals feel a lack of necessary books and materials and working equipment in their work, or a lack of appropriate assistants, resulting in low work efficiency. This situation indeed exists. For example, many units with a large number of books and materials have not fully valued these precious properties, have not assigned appropriate personnel to organize them, and thus some experts cannot use these books and materials for research. The main reason for this phenomenon is that we are not familiar with their needs, or although we have heard about it many times, we have not taken responsibility to solve it. Some workers do not want to bother with these "small things," which is wrong. This is not a "small thing," we should quickly and seriously solve these problems.

The living treatment of intellectuals, generally speaking, has been improved compared to before liberation, but to enable senior intellectuals to devote more energy to work, their living treatment should be appropriately improved. Some senior intellectuals spend too much unnecessary time on daily trivial matters, which should be regarded as a loss of national labor. The living conditions of some senior intellectuals are too poor, and in Beijing and other cities with particularly rapid population growth, there is a situation where a family of several people live in a small room. Their rest and entertainment life is also poorly organized. All these problems should be seriously solved by the competent departments.

To better solve the living treatment problem of intellectuals, we mainly need to start from three aspects: First, we should educate the administrative management personnel of all relevant units to attach importance to the living conditions of intellectuals from a ideological perspective, especially to break the erroneous idea of only caring about the living of administrative leaders while feeling that intellectuals are "not worth caring for, why should I serve you." Once this is done, half of the problem can be solved. Second, we should educate the trade union organizations and consumer cooperative organizations of all relevant units to strive to expand services for the intellectuals of their units. The union dues should be used to a large extent for the cultural activities and material welfare of the unit. The union workers should go deep into the masses and use a tenacious spirit to solve various living difficulties for the members of the unit, which should be an important task for various intellectual unions. Third, we should adjust the wages of intellectuals appropriately according to the principle of remuneration according to work, so that the wages they receive are commensurate with the size of their contributions to the country, and eliminate the egalitarian tendency and other irrational phenomena in the wage system. In addition, some intellectuals who are not within the scope of state personnel, such as some actors, painters, and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, currently have relatively low incomes, and this problem should also be solved by the competent departments.

Another important issue related to the living treatment of intellectuals is the promotion system. Our current promotion system has many irrational aspects: there are many grades but small intervals; the grades of college graduates are too low; there are no definite promotion methods and promotion standards; many units do not promote for several years, so some people have not been promoted. This irrational promotion system greatly hinders the enthusiasm of intellectuals in their professional work, especially the cultivation of new forces and the promotion of general intellectuals. This system must be quickly modified. In addition, regarding the systems of academic degrees, academic titles, honorary titles in the intellectual community, and rewards for inventions and excellent works, these are also important methods to encourage intellectuals to make progress and stimulate the progress of science and culture. These systems are being drafted by relevant departments and should be determined and published as soon as possible.

Regarding the political treatment of intellectuals, there are also some places that need to be improved. The main issue here is to eliminate the indifference of many units to the political life of intellectuals. Some intellectuals complain that we make them listen to a long report several times, but more intellectuals complain that we do not let them listen to a report for a year. Similarly, there are many social activities, some people think they participate too much, but more people think that if they can have the opportunity to participate once, they will be greatly encouraged. These aspects, we should pay attention to and make appropriate adjustments. In addition, we should also conduct education among the staff to let them understand how to correctly treat intellectuals and not inadvertently hurt their legitimate self-respect, which is something that any honest laborer should have.

The above-mentioned points are some necessary conditions for fully mobilizing and giving full play to the strengths of intellectuals. Of course, for this purpose, we still need to give them education and transformation, and give them political and professional leadership, which we will discuss later. However, in any case, the above-mentioned conditions are indispensable. With these conditions, it will be more convenient to mobilize intellectuals to give full play to their strengths in the great cause of national construction, and it will also be more convenient to promote their progress in politics and professional skills.

Title: Continuing the Self-Transformation of Intellectuals is an Important Political Task in the Transitional Period

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 26th.

Continuing the self-transformation of intellectuals is one of the important political tasks in the transitional period for the Party. Our country is now in a transitional period, which is the most profound period of social transformation. The private ownership of the means of production, which has lasted for thousands of years, is to be transformed into socialist public ownership; the exploitative system, which has lasted for thousands of years, is to be permanently abolished; all people are to become laborers of different types. Such a radical change cannot but cause intense reactions in various aspects of our social life and thought. Therefore, all social problems in this period, including the problem of intellectuals, cannot be observed without considering class struggle. The political divisions and changes among intellectuals are precisely the reflection of the progress of class struggle within the ranks of intellectuals. We have already seen that among the current intellectuals, there are still a few percent of counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements (such as swindlers and hooligans), and these people need to be purged from the ranks of intellectuals. Apart from this, there are also a few people who oppose socialism in their thoughts and are completely ignorant of socialism. We should criticize their erroneous thoughts and strive to win them over to the side of socialism.

The work of purging counter-revolutionaries hidden in the intellectual community has achieved great success in the past year. We should continue to strive to achieve the goal of basically purging counter-revolutionaries in the next two years.

In the struggle against counter-revolutionaries, it is important not to implicate those who have only had ordinary social relations with counter-revolutionaries, because there are many such people among intellectuals. If they were previously incorrectly mixed with counter-revolutionaries, we should explain it to them clearly. For those who have only had historical relations with counter-revolutionary organizations and have genuinely changed their stance since liberation, after they have made appropriate explanations, they should be treated the same as ordinary people.

As mentioned earlier, there is still some estrangement between a part of the intellectuals and our Party. We must actively strive to eliminate this estrangement. However, this estrangement often comes from both sides: on the one hand, it is because our comrades have not approached them and understood them; on the other hand, it is because a part of the intellectuals have taken a reserved or even opposing attitude towards socialism. In our enterprises, schools, and institutions, and in society, there are still such intellectuals: they do not distinguish between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, between the Chinese people and imperialism; they are dissatisfied with the policies and measures of the Party and the people's government, longing for capitalism and even feudalism; they oppose the Soviet Union and are unwilling to learn from the Soviet Union; they refuse to learn Marxism-Leninism and even defame Marxism-Leninism; they look down on labor, look down on laboring people, look down on cadres of laboring people's origin, and are unwilling to associate with workers, peasants, and cadres of worker-peasant origin; they do not want to see the growth of new forces, thinking that progressives are opportunists; they not only often create disputes and antagonism between intellectuals and the Party but also create disputes and antagonism among intellectuals; they are arrogant, thinking they are the best in the world, unable to accept the leadership and criticism of anyone; they deny the interests of the people and society, looking at everything from the perspective of personal interests, supporting what is in their own interests and opposing what is not in their own interests. Of course, all these errors are not common among current intellectuals; however, those who have one or several of the above errors are not few. Not only among backward elements but also among a part of the intermediate elements, there are often some of the above erroneous viewpoints. Narrow-mindedness, arrogance, and looking at problems from the perspective of personal interests are also not uncommon among progressives. Such intellectuals, if they do not change their stance, even if we strive to approach them, there will still be estrangement between them and us.

Therefore, we should not only transform backward elements but also educate intermediate elements as much as possible to help them get out of the intermediate state and become progressives; for progressives, we must help them continue to progress, help them strive to learn Marxism-Leninism, and eliminate the influences of capitalism, individualism, and idealism in their thoughts. We should cultivate a large number of red experts who are determined to struggle for socialism among high-level intellectuals. Currently, some high-level intellectuals have already become red experts, and many people have such aspirations. We should enthusiastically help them in their self-transformation and realize their aspirations. Any attitude of exclusion and discrimination towards them is wrong.

In summary, thoroughly purging counter-revolutionaries hidden in the intellectual community, reducing backward elements to the minimum, helping intermediate elements to become progressives as much as possible, and making progressives into completely socialist intellectuals—this is our program for continuing the transformation of intellectuals in the current stage.

Regarding the transformation of intellectuals, we have already accumulated rich experience and achieved great success. Therefore, the question of whether intellectuals can be transformed no longer needs detailed discussion. Our current task is to summarize past experience, overcome some shortcomings in past work, and make future work more planned. Since we see various political divisions among intellectuals, we should roughly formulate plans according to this situation to educate progressives, intermediate elements, and backward elements, and implement various effective measures that have been proven.

The transformation of intellectuals usually goes through three paths: one is through the observation and practice of social life; one is through their own professional practice; one is through general theoretical learning. These three aspects are interrelated, and a person's change in thought is often influenced by all three aspects. However, generally speaking, the educational role of social life is the most extensive and direct. Everyone knows that the transformation of the thoughts of many intellectuals began with participating in land reform and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. In recent years, visits to factories and villages have also greatly helped intellectuals gain confidence in socialism. However, we have not systematically organized this work, especially many intermediate elements and backward elements are often not included in our plans. In the future, we should treat organizing intellectuals to visit socialist construction as an important task and make comprehensive arrangements so that everyone who has not visited can have the opportunity in the next few years.

Professional practice also has a significant impact on the ideological transformation of intellectuals. In the past few years, the reform of teaching methods and the adoption of Soviet textbooks have made many teachers who previously did not believe in the Soviet Union and Marxism-Leninism change their minds. Similarly, the creative achievements of the Chinese working people and peasants in production technology, the promotion of Soviet scientific and technological achievements in China, and the practical demonstrations of Soviet experts have also convinced many scientific and technological personnel of the superiority of the socialist system. In the future, we should continue to develop this aspect of experience. However, in the issue of learning from the Soviet Union, there have been shortcomings of being overly hasty, rigid, and mechanical in the past, and some comrades even arbitrarily denied the scientific and technological achievements of capitalist countries. These shortcomings should be avoided in the future.

The learning of Marxism-Leninism has a decisive significance for establishing the revolutionary worldview and scientific worldview of intellectuals. However, in some places, this learning is not well organized, or the level of the guiding personnel is too low, or the learning plans and methods do not meet the needs of high-level intellectuals. In the future, we should overcome these shortcomings, formulate some compulsory basic courses of Marxism-Leninism according to the principles of voluntariness and relevance to professional work, and focus on adopting self-study, night schools, correspondence schools, and scientific discussion meetings to help intellectuals learn theory.

Since the transformation of intellectuals is a reflection of class struggle, this transformation process itself cannot be without considerable struggle. First, we must require all intellectuals to stand on the patriotic position, abide by the constitution, and distinguish between enemies and us. If a person violates the patriotic position and the constitution, and in speech and action confuses enemies and us, then it is unimaginable that people would not struggle against such a person. Second, between socialist thought and capitalist thought, between materialist thought and idealist thought, there cannot be a sharp struggle. The process of ideological transformation of intellectuals is inseparable from the development of ideological struggle in the intellectual community. Since liberation, the Party-led ideological transformation movement and the criticism of idealist thought have had a great effect on the progress of intellectuals. In ideological struggle, it should be noted that a person's change in thought must go through his own self-awareness. Using rough methods to carry out ideological transformation cannot solve the problem. However, the phenomenon of using rough methods to deal with scientists and scientific issues has recently been discovered, and all places must pay attention to correcting it. In addition, some people, although they insist on their erroneous thoughts, as long as they do not oppose the people in speech and action and are even willing to use their knowledge and energy to work for the people, then, while criticizing their erroneous thoughts, we should still be patient and help them gradually awaken.

To help intellectuals achieve progress, it is important for Party leaders to have direct contact with them. Many intellectuals hope that we can give them more help and criticism in thought and politics, and they feel that we give them too little of this kind of help. Many intellectuals, not only have difficulty contacting the leading comrades of local Party committees, but even living with the committee members of their own units, they also have few opportunities to talk. They say that we "use them more, help them less," or "only use them, not help them." Some people say that our cadres only find them for three things: (1) transferring work; (2) explaining history; (3) making mistakes. These criticisms are sharp and should be noted. We should include having thought and political talks with them, giving them comrade-like criticism, in the plan for transforming intellectuals. Organizing some symposiums to exchange views with them is something they welcome, and this should be held regularly in the future. In addition, according to specific circumstances, some non-Party intellectuals should be invited to attend certain Party group meetings and branch meetings, so that they can further understand the Party's intentions and accept the Party's education.

To help the progress of intellectuals, in addition to relying on Communist Party members, we must also organize the approximately 40% of progressives in the ranks of intellectuals to participate in work. The Youth League, trade unions, and various democratic parties have done a lot of work in this regard in the past few years, and in the future, they should use their strength more systematically.

Because we have more experience in transforming intellectuals and have the support of progressive forces, and because general intellectuals are increasingly deeply influenced by socialist education in the rapid development of the motherland, their progress will certainly be faster than in the past few years. As long as every unit in the country formulates plans for the transformation of intellectuals, including the seven-year plan from 1956 to 1962 and the annual plan, and implements them persistently, then we will definitely be able to achieve the goal that by the end of the second five-year plan, progressive elements who actively struggle for socialism and accept the basic views of Marxism-Leninism will account for more than three-quarters of high-level intellectuals, and backward elements will be reduced to about 5%.

Regarding the work of recruiting Party members from intellectuals, plans should also be formulated. Now there are many progressive intellectuals who want to join the Party. For example, the Engineering and Technical Personnel of the Non-Ferrous Metallurgy Design Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry have a total of 1,920 people, with 605 applying to join the Party, accounting for 31.5%. There are 291 lecturers and above in six colleges and universities in Tianjin, with 106 applying to join the Party, accounting for 36.4%. There are 131 researchers in the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, with 53 applying to join the Party, accounting for 40%. However, in the past few years, we have rarely recruited Party members from them, which is a tendency of exclusivism. This tendency must be corrected. Of course, we must pay attention to strictly recruiting Party members according to Party member conditions, but we can believe that among these applicants, there are many who meet the conditions of Party members. Considering the increase of progressive forces among high-level intellectuals and the continuous influx of new forces into the ranks of high-level intellectuals, we believe that planning to make Party members account for about one-third of the total number of high-level intellectuals by 1962 is appropriate.

By implementing the above plans, the ideological and political situation of the intellectual community in our country will have a fundamental change. We will be able to basically complete the specific historical task of transforming intellectuals in the transitional period of our country. At that time, intellectuals, like all people, will still need to continuously transform themselves in learning and practice and strive to advance to higher progressive standards on a new level. However, that will be a task of a permanent nature.

To adapt to the rapid development of national construction, our intellectual community must be expanded in quantity and improved in professional level.

The scientific and cultural strength of our country is currently much smaller and much lower in quality than that of the Soviet Union and other major countries, which is very inconsistent with the needs of our socialist country with a population of six hundred million. We must catch up quickly and strive to expand and improve our scientific and cultural strength as soon as possible, and catch up with the world's advanced level in a not too long time. This is a great combat task for our Party and the entire intellectual community and the people of the country.

We often say that our science and culture are backward, but we do not often study where exactly we are backward. Comrades! I want to talk a little more about scientific issues here, not only because science is a decisive factor in our national defense, economy, and culture, but also because world science has made particularly great and rapid progress in the past twenty or thirty years, and these progress have left us far behind in scientific development.

Modern science and technology are advancing by leaps and bounds. The production process is gradually realizing comprehensive mechanization, comprehensive automation, and remote control, thereby raising labor productivity to an unprecedented level. Various high-temperature, high-pressure, high-speed, and ultra-high-temperature, ultra-high-pressure, ultra-high-speed machines are being designed and produced. Land, water, and air transportation machines are improving in range and speed, and high-speed aircraft have already exceeded the speed of sound. The progress in technology requires various materials with new special properties, so various new metal and alloy materials, as well as materials artificially synthesized by chemical methods, are being continuously produced to meet these new needs. The production technology and process specifications of various industries are changing day by day, ensuring the further acceleration and intensification of the production process, the most thorough utilization of the useful components of resources, the maximum saving of raw materials, and the continuous improvement of product quality.

The highest peak of the new developments in science and technology is the utilization of atomic energy. Atomic energy provides mankind with an incredibly powerful new source of energy, opening up a vast prospect for the renewal of various fields of science. At the same time, due to the progress of electronics and other sciences, the emergence of electronic automatic control machines (such as electronic computers that can perform 15,000 mathematical calculations per second, etc.) has begun to be able to conditionally replace a part of specific mental labor, just as other machines replace physical labor, thereby greatly improving the level of automation technology. These latest achievements make mankind face the dawn of a new scientific and technological and industrial revolution. This revolution, as Comrade Bulganin has said, "in terms of its significance, far exceeds the industrial revolution brought about by the appearance of steam and electricity."

We must catch up with this world's advanced scientific level. We must remember that when we catch up, others are also advancing rapidly. Therefore, we must work hard in this area. Only by mastering the most advanced science can we have a solid national defense, a powerful and advanced economic force, and sufficient conditions to defeat imperialist countries together with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, whether in peaceful competition or in wars of aggression launched by the enemy.

It is currently difficult to accurately estimate how long it will take for our science to catch up with the world's advanced level. However, we must now propose such a task, that is, to make our most urgently needed scientific fields approach the world's advanced level by the end of the third five-year plan, and make the latest achievements of foreign countries quickly reach us through our own efforts. With this foundation, we can further solve the problem of catching up with the world's level.

To complete this great task, we must first break away from the lack of national self-confidence and dependence. "China's backwardness in science cannot be changed immediately, and it must rely on Soviet aid." It is true that we need to rely on Soviet aid to change our backwardness. However, how should we use this aid? One way is to have no overall plan, treating each problem as it arises, and asking the Soviet Union for help when encountering a problem. Those sent to study in the Soviet Union are not scientists, but mostly high school graduates. The result is that they can never get rid of the state of dependence and imitation, and the burden on the Soviet scientific community is indefinitely increased, hindering the planned and rapid development of Chinese science, which affects the speed of growth of the scientific strength, economic strength, and defensive strength of the entire socialist camp. Another way is to make an overall plan, distinguish between urgent and non-urgent, and systematically use the latest achievements of Soviet science to catch up with the Soviet level as soon as possible. This means that, in addition to asking for Soviet aid for urgent tasks and learning technology from Soviet aid, for all the fields in which Chinese science needs to learn from the Soviet Union, we should systematically send relatively mature scientific talents to study in the Soviet Union, or invite Soviet experts to help us establish the foundation of scientific research in China, so that we can quickly start continuous research and cadre training at the level that the Soviet Union has already reached. In this way, we can most effectively and reasonably use Soviet aid to promote the planned development of Chinese science, making it possible for the two countries' scientific undertakings to establish a cooperative relationship as soon as possible, which is to promote the growth of the scientific strength, economic strength, and defensive strength of the entire socialist camp. The latter method is the only correct method that has been repeatedly suggested by scientists of the two countries and that we should adopt.

To systematically improve the scientific level of our country, we must also break away from the short-sighted tendency. In theoretical work and technical work, in long-term needs and current needs, the allocation of forces should maintain an appropriate proportion and form a correct division of labor and cooperation to avoid neglecting any aspect. In the past few years, various work in our country has just begun, and we have invested more strength in current needs and technical work, while paying less attention to long-term needs and theoretical work, which is understandable. However, if we do not pay timely attention to strengthening long-term needs and theoretical work, we will make a big mistake. Without a certain amount of theoretical scientific research as a foundation, it is impossible to have fundamental progress and innovation in technology. However, the growth of theoretical strength is always slower than the growth of technical strength, and the effect of theoretical work is generally indirect and not easy to see immediately. Precisely because of this, many comrades still have a short-sighted tendency, they are not willing to invest the necessary strength in scientific research, and often require scientists to solve relatively simple technical application and production operation problems. Of course, theory should not be separated from practice, and any "theoretical research" that is separated from practice is what we must oppose, but the current main tendency is the neglect of theoretical research. This situation not only exists in natural sciences but also in social sciences. Currently, the strength we allocate in social sciences is even weaker than that in natural sciences, which is very inconsistent with the needs of our country. For example, the members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the field of natural sciences are 172 people, and currently, more than half of them can actually use most of their time for scientific work; in the field of social sciences, there are 51 people, but currently, only a few of them can actually use most of their time for scientific research work!

The above two tendencies are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. We must thoroughly correct these incorrect tendencies and change these situations that are not conducive to the development of science.

The State Council has now entrusted the State Planning Commission to be responsible, together with relevant departments, to formulate a long-term plan for scientific development from 1956 to 1967 within three months. When formulating this long-term plan, we must, according to what is possible and necessary, introduce the most advanced achievements of world science to the scientific departments, national defense departments, production departments, and educational departments of our country as soon as possible, and make up for the scientific and technological fields that are most lacking in our scientific community and most urgently needed for national construction as soon as possible, so that in 12 years, the scientific and technological level of these fields in our country can approach that of the Soviet Union and other major countries.

What is the fastest and most effective way to achieve this goal?

Such a path is: first, according to the fields we most urgently need, quickly dispatch several groups of experts, outstanding scientific workers, and outstanding university graduates to the Soviet Union and other countries for one to two years of internship or as graduate students, and upon their return, immediately establish the foundation for the development of these sciences and technologies in the Academy of Sciences and various government departments, and train a large number of new cadres. At the same time, according to the needs, send people to intern and study every year. Second, for a part of the disciplines, invite several groups of experts from the Soviet Union and other relevant countries to be responsible for helping us establish scientific research institutions in the Academy of Sciences and relevant departments in the shortest time, train cadres, or cooperate with the Chinese scientific community. Third, systematically organize a large number of scientific workers and technicians to learn from the Soviet experts currently in China, treating them as mentors rather than ordinary workers. In the process of construction and production of the 156 projects aided by the Soviet Union in China, systematically organize a large number of technicians to study and master the new technical principles, and quickly pass them on. Fourth, concentrate the most outstanding scientific strength and the most outstanding university graduates in scientific research. Use great efforts to strengthen the Chinese Academy of Sciences, making it the locomotive for leading the improvement of the scientific level and cultivating new forces nationwide. Fifth, the scientific strength in various colleges and universities accounts for the vast majority of the national scientific strength, and must, under the guidance of the national scientific development plan, vigorously develop scientific research work and train a large number of new scientific and technological forces that meet modern standards. Sixth, the various departments of the government, especially the departments of geology, industry, agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, national defense, and health, should quickly establish and strengthen the necessary research institutions, reasonably divide labor and cooperate with the Academy of Sciences, jointly expand the scientific community, and be responsible for introducing the latest achievements of world science into practical applications in a planned and systematic way, so as to equip our country's various aspects with the world's latest technology as soon as possible.

To seriously, rather than just talk about, march towards modern science, we must seize the time. A year's time is very easy to waste in empty talk and indecision. Therefore, the Central Committee requires: by the end of April this year, we must determine the long-term plan for scientific development, the specific plans for this year and next year that are suitable for this long-term plan, and the first batch of scientific strength that needs to be immediately mobilized to implement this long-term plan and the plans for this year and next year (including the list of scientific personnel to be dispatched abroad, the number of Soviet experts to be hired, the number of people to be transferred from other positions to scientific research positions, and the main personnel list, etc.), and strive to implement the dispatch and transfer plans by the end of June this year as much as possible. Regarding the plan to expand scientific research work and expand the cultivation of scientific strength in colleges and universities nationwide, it must be implemented after this summer vacation.

To implement the plan to march towards science, we must prepare all necessary conditions for the development of scientific research. Here, the most important thing is to ensure that scientists have the necessary books, archives, technical materials, and other working conditions. We must increase the book fees of various research institutions and colleges and universities and use them reasonably, strengthen the work of libraries, archives, and museums, greatly improve the work of importing foreign books and periodicals, and rationally allocate existing books and periodicals. We must expand foreign language teaching and expand the translation of important foreign books.

The above-mentioned principles generally also apply to other departments of culture and education. All cultural and educational departments should formulate development plans from 1956 to 1967 and adopt the most effective measures to implement them.

Our plan to develop scientific and cultural strength must be a plan that is both improved and expanded, because not only is our country a large country, which requires a certain number to meet the needs of various aspects, but quality generally can only be produced on the basis of a certain number.

To expand the scientific and cultural strength of our country, we must first increase the number of students in colleges and universities according to the plan, and we must also pay attention to cultivating existing general intellectuals and continuously improving their professional level. They are not only an extremely important reserve force and collaborator for high-level intellectuals but also, as mentioned earlier, are much more numerous than high-level intellectuals; they are distributed in various regions and departments of the country, shouldering a huge responsibility for national construction. The central departments and various provinces and municipalities must formulate special plans to help their further studies, so that their professional abilities can be rapidly improved, and the outstanding elements among them can be promoted to the ranks of high-level intellectuals.

Our Party is successfully solving the problems of agricultural cooperation and handicraft cooperation, and is successfully solving the problem of transforming capitalist industry and commerce. The whole Party and the working people of the whole country are striving to complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule and over-fulfill it. The people of the whole country are full of confidence in victory and the spirit of struggle. With the surging tide of socialist economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will surely appear. At this time, we comprehensively solve a series of problems about intellectuals, which is undoubtedly very necessary for our socialist transformation and socialist construction.

In the tasks we have proposed regarding intellectuals, it cannot be said that there are no difficulties. However, these difficulties will not be more difficult than transforming five hundred million peasants and transforming the capitalist industry and commerce of the whole country, and will not be more difficult than completing the first five-year plan. In the past six years, our Party has achieved great success in leading intellectuals and leading scientific and cultural undertakings. Now we are more experienced and have more ways to do it, and on the basis of past experience, our Party will definitely be able to lead intellectuals to achieve new and greater victories in scientific and cultural undertakings. The idea that the Party cannot lead intellectuals to engage in scientific and cultural construction is groundless.

The key is to learn well. Whether it is the central departments or various regions, they must learn to better lead intellectuals and lead scientific and cultural undertakings. We should not think that since we are Communist Party members, we will naturally be able to lead intellectuals to engage in cultural construction, and we will naturally not make mistakes. This is a very dangerous idea. In some places, some comrades are precisely because of holding such an arrogant attitude that the Party's work has suffered losses. We must adopt an honest attitude of "knowing is knowing, not knowing is not knowing" towards any problem, and we must not pretend to know when we do not know, but we must change from not knowing to knowing. Our Party must cultivate a large number of cadres who are proficient in the knowledge of various departments of science and culture. As long as we seriously delve into it, we will definitely be able to learn it.

In the report, many tasks need to be solved by the central government in a unified manner. Regarding these problems, we propose the following division of labor:

Regarding various administrative issues about intellectuals, because they need to be uniformly regulated and managed, the State Council plans to set up a China Expert Bureau to be responsible for handling them. However, before this institution is established, relevant departments should immediately start solving various problems about intellectuals according to the instructions of the central government. After this institution is established, various departments should not reduce their direct responsibility for handling them, because the Expert Bureau generally only handles problems that are not convenient for a single department to handle alone. The Expert Bureau is responsible for unified planning, unified adjustment, and unified supervision and promotion of various administrative issues about high-level intellectuals. For the places where various departments handle high-level intellectual issues improperly, the Expert Bureau has the right to correct them according to certain procedures.

Regarding various political issues about intellectuals, regarding continuing ideological transformation and handling related counter-revolutionary elements in intellectuals, they are directly responsible by various relevant departments, and the Central Propaganda Department is responsible for unified supervision. The Central Propaganda Department should regularly check the implementation of the central policies on intellectuals by various departments and regions, check their work plans and the implementation of plans, overcome the shortcomings in their work, promote the advanced experience in their work, and timely report problems and suggestions to the central government.

The work of recruiting Party members from intellectuals is the responsibility of the Central Organization Department. The work of democratic parties among intellectuals is the responsibility of the Central United Front Work Department. The trade union work among intellectuals is the responsibility of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. However, when solving important problems in these works, they should be coordinated with the Central Propaganda Department.

To strengthen leadership, handle, and supervise issues related to intellectuals, party committees and various departments at all levels should respectively designate appropriate institutions to take on the responsibility of regular work, and regularly hold some special meetings to continuously exchange experiences and improve the work situation.

Comrades! We believe that through our work, intellectuals will be more united around the Party and will be more active in contributing their strength to the great cause of socialism. The alliance formed by workers, peasants, and intellectuals in the cause of socialism will be more solid and powerful with the development of our work. Relying on this alliance, we will definitely be able to build our country into a completely modernized, prosperous, and powerful socialist industrial power in a not too long time, and definitely be able to realize Comrade Mao Zedong's great call—"We will appear before the world as a nation with a high level of culture."

    关于知识分子问题的报告
    （1956年1月14日，在中国共产党中央委员会召开的关于知识分子问题的会议上）
    周恩来同志们！
    为着加强党对于知识分子的领导，加强党对于整个科学文化工作的领导，中央决定召集一次会议讨论知识分子问题。
    中央的这个决定，是中央领导全党反对保守思想、努力完成过渡时期总任务的整个斗争的一部分。
    大家知道，在1955年内，根据毛泽东同志的倡议，党中央曾经对于党内的右倾保守思想，进行了一系列的斗争。这一系列的斗争的最重要的结果，就是肃清反革命分子运动在机关内在社会上都有步骤地彻底展开，预计今后两年内将在全国范围内基本上完成；就是农业合作化运动在群众觉悟迅速增长的基础上突飞猛进，今年将在全国范围内基本上完成半社会主义的合作化，并且正在向着全社会主义的合作化发展；就是资本主义工商业的全行业公私合营迅速发展，今年也很有可能在全国范围内基本上完成；就是发展国民经济的第一个五年计划整个地将要提前和超额完成，预计某些生产部门可以在1956年完成1957年的生产计划，其他各部也都有可能提前和超额完成五年计划。
    所有这些巨大的动人的成就，在一年以前还是不可想像的；如果不展开反对右倾保守思想的斗争，那末这些成就，到现在也还是不可能获得的。由此可见，右倾保守思想在我们党内的危害是多么严重。
    反对右倾保守思想的斗争的基本要求，是应该更加巩固和发展我国人民民主专政，提早完成社会主义改造，超额完成国家工业发展计划和加速进行国民经济的技术改造。这个斗争有重大的世界意义。在我们六亿人口的大国中，能够提前完成和加速进行这些任务，把这些任务完成和进行得又多、又快、又好、又省，就将使整个社会主义阵营的力量，得到更快更大的加强，就将更有利于我们阻止新的战争的爆发，而如果疯狂的侵略者敢于发动新的战争，我们也将处于更有力的地位。因此，党中央决定，把反对右倾保守思想作为党的第八次全国代表大会的中心问题，要求全党在一切工作部门中展开这个斗争。
    知识分子问题，就是在这样的基础上提出来的。
    知识分子问题，同我们目前的加速社会主义建设的任务，究竟有什么关系呢？
    我们所以要建设社会主义经济，归根结底，是为了最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要，而为了达到这个目的，就必须不断地发展社会生产力，不断地提高劳动生产率，就必须在高度技术的基础上，使社会主义生产不断地增长，不断地改善。因此，在社会主义时代，比以前任何时代都更加需要充分地提高生产技术，更加需要充分地发展科学和利用科学知识。因此，我们要又多、又快、又好、又省地发展社会主义建设，除了必需依靠工人阶级和广大农民的积极劳动以外，还必须依靠知识分子的积极劳动，也就是说，必须依靠体力劳动和脑力劳动的密切合作，依靠工人、农民、知识分子的兄弟联盟。我们现在所进行的各项建设，正在愈来愈多地需要知识分子的参加。比方说，我们要找矿，就得有一批地质专家，带上大批大学毕业生和中学毕业生，到各处的荒山僻野去进行测量、普查、详查和钻探。我们要建设矿山、工厂、铁路和水利工程，就得有一批工程师和一大批技术员来勘测、设计、建筑和安装。工厂要生产，生产中从产品设计到成品检验的每一个环节，都需要一定数量和一定水平的技术力量。工业和商业的管理，愈来愈需要各种专门的知识。要建设现代化的国防，就需要各种科学专家。没有教师和医生，我们就不能有学校和医院。没有文化艺术工作者，我们就不能有文化生活。在农村里，实现农业机械化和电气化以后，固然需要有大批的农业机器工程师、电站工程师、农学家、会计师等等；就在目前，为着实现从1956年到1967年农业发展纲要（草案）中的许多马上就要着手的项目，例如为着生产新式畜力农具、化学肥料和抽水机，消灭主要的病虫害，消灭严重的人类疾病和畜疫，也必须依靠科学技术工作者、植物保护学者、医务工作者和兽医的积极参加。因此，知识分子已经成为我们国家的各方面生活中的重要因素。而正确地解决知识分子问题，更充分地动员和发挥他们的力量，为伟大的社会主义建设服务，也就成为我们努力完成过渡时期总任务的一个重要条件。我们党的各个部门，党的各级组织，都应该重视这个问题。
    什么是当前的知识分子问题呢？当前的根本问题，就是我们的知识分子的力量，无论在数量方面，业务水平方面，政治觉悟方面，都不足以适应社会主义建设急速发展的需要；而我们目前对于知识分子的使用和待遇中的某些不合理现象，特别是一部分同志对于党外知识分子的某些宗派主义情绪，更在相当程度上妨碍了知识分子现有力量的充分发挥。我们必须加强领导，克服缺点，采取一系列有效的措施，最充分地动员和发挥现有的知识分子的力量，不断地提高他们的政治觉悟，大规模地培养新生力量来扩大他们的队伍，并且尽可能迅速地提高他们的业务水平，以适应国家对于知识分子的不断增长的需要。这就是我们党目前在知识分子问题上的根本任务。
        （一）
    为了讨论党在知识分子问题上的任务，我们首先要把目前知识分子的情况考察一下。
    我们党向来是重视知识分子问题的。还在1939年，党中央就通过了毛泽东同志所起草的关于大量吸收知识分子的决定，并且在各个抗日根据地有效地实施了。全国解放以后，党在全国范围内对于知识分子实行了团结、教育、改造的政策。党中央认定：革命需要吸收知识分子，建设尤其需要吸收知识分子。特别是由于解放前的我国是一个文化落后科学落后的国家，我们就更必须善于充分地利用旧社会遗留下来的这批知识分子的历史遗产，使他们为我国的社会主义建设服务。党中央又认定：我国旧时代的知识分子在过去虽然受了帝国主义和反动阶级的种种影响，但是他们中间的绝大多数同时也受着帝国主义和国民党的压迫，因而一部分参加了革命，一部分同情于革命，多数对于革命抱着中立的观望的态度，反革命分子只占极少数。事实日益给中国知识分子提出证明：他们除了同工人阶级和共产党一道，并没有什么别的出路。因此，团结知识分子是必要的，也是完全可能的。从这个认识出发，党中央对于旧时代的知识分子采取了“包下来”的方针，绝大多数都继续给以适当的工作，其中一部分还分配了负责的工作；对于原来失业的知识分子也努力帮助他们就业，或者给以其他的适当的安排。在政治方面，党给了许多知识分子的代表人物以应有的地位。党中央认为：对于旧时代的知识分子必须帮助他们进行自我改造，使他们抛弃地主阶级和资产阶级的思想，接受工人阶级的思想。为了这个目的，党采取了一系列的步骤。党组织他们去参加土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝、“三反”“五反”的斗争，参观工厂和农村，访问苏联，参加各种国际活动，领导他们学习马克思列宁主义的基本知识，批判资产阶级的唯心主义观点，进行反对胡风反革命集团和其他反革命分子的斗争，并且在学习的基础上展开批评和自我批评。在业务方面，党也采取了许多步骤，帮助他们掌握理论和实际相联系的原则，学习苏联先进经验，改进工作方法，提高业务能力。他们中间的绝大部分已经成为国家工作人员，已经为社会主义服务，已经是工人阶级的一部分。在团结、教育、改造旧知识分子的同时，党又用了很大的力量来培养大量的新的知识分子，其中已经有相当数量的劳动阶级出身的知识分子。由于这一切，我国的知识界的面貌在过去六年来已经发生了根本的变化。
    关于知识分子的目前的政治状况，许多单位作了统计。这些统计表明：在高级知识分子中间，积极拥护共产党和人民政府、积极拥护社会主义、积极为人民服务的进步分子约占40％左右；拥护共产党和人民政府、一般能够完成任务、但是在政治上不够积极的中间分子也约占40％左右；以上两部分合占80％左右。在这80％左右以外，缺乏政治觉悟或者在思想上反对社会主义的落后分子约占百分之十几，反革命分子和其他坏分子约占百分之几。
    同解放初期比较起来，这个变化是很快的。例如，根据北京、天津、青岛4所高等学校对于141个教师的统计，过去六年中，进步分子由18％增为41％，落后分子由28％减为15％。许多知识分子在我国伟大的社会主义改造和社会主义建设的事业面前，不能不日益受到强烈的影响，并且从中国的新生中看到全民族和他们自己的互相关连的命运。
    在这里需要注意的是，知识分子的思想状态，同他们在政治和社会地位上的变化并不是完全相适应的。许多进步分子也还有程度不同的资产阶级唯心主义和个人主义的思想作风，更不要说中间分子了。此外，有不少单位的知识分子、特别是其中比较落后的部分的变化很慢，也反映我们在他们中间做的工作很少。
    知识分子的队伍在过去六年中在数量上也有了很快的扩大。目前全国在科学研究、教育、工程技术、卫生、文化艺术和其他方面的高级知识分子根据估计约为十万人，其中在解放以后增加的数字，根据一部分材料统计，约占三分之一左右。有些部门增加得特别快。例如，地质工作人员在解放初期不满200人，而在1955年，根据地质、重工业、石油工业、煤炭工业等四个部的统计，只是工程师就已经增加到497人，而高等学校毕业的技术员就达到3，440人。
    解放以后六年中，全国高等学校毕业生已经达到217，900人。他们虽然并不都合乎我们所说的高级知识分子的标准，但是他们是知识界的新生力量，并且是专家的后备军。而且必须指出，有许多青年虽然在等级上还不是专家，却已经担任了专家的工作，并且一般地担任得不坏。在高等学校的42，000教学人员中，教授和副教授只占17.8％，讲师占24％，助教占58.2％，而一部分助教现在已经参加了教课的工作。在工程界也是一样。全国各级工程师只有31，000多人，而高等学校毕业的各级技术员却有63，600人，他们中间的很多人实际上是担任着工程师的工作，其中有些人早已应该被提升为工程师了。除此以外，作为高级知识分子的后备军的，还有其他知识分子的广大队伍，他们正在实际工作和业余自学的过程中不断地提高他们的知识水平。
    所谓高级知识分子和一般知识分子，中间并没有严格的界限。现在就已经有统计数目的科学研究、教育、工程技术、卫生、文化艺术五个方面的知识分子来看，共有384万人。他们是社会主义建设事业中一支伟大的力量。正确地估计和使用这些知识分子，有计划地帮助他们在政治上和业务上不断进步，是党和国家的极其重要的任务。在我的报告中，虽然着重地讨论有关高级知识分子的问题，但是大部分原则同样地适用于一般知识分子。
    如上所说，我国知识分子现在已经成为一支很大的队伍。但是，我们的国家是这样地大，我们的建设事业发展得这样地快，今后还要发展得更快，因此，我们不能不更快地扩大知识分子的队伍，尤其是高级知识分子的队伍，以满足社会主义建设的迫切需要。应该承认，我们培养和提拔新生力量的工作也还有很多缺点，这些缺点阻碍着知识分子队伍的更快的扩大。
    我国知识分子的业务水平在过去六年中也有了显著的提高。全国的高等学校进行了教学改革，新设了许多以前全国所没有的系和专业，新编和翻译了大量的教材，提高了教学的质量。全国的科学技术界在地质勘探方面、基本建设设计和施工方面、新产品设计和试制方面，都进行了巨大的工作，得到了显著的成就。由于努力向苏联学习的结果，我国工程界现在已经学会了许多现代化的工厂、矿井、桥梁、水利建设的设计和施工，在设计大型机械、机车、轮船方面的能力也有很大的提高。从1952年到1955年试制成功的新的机械产品，已经约有3，500种左右，少数已经达到世界水平。在冶金方面，我国能够冶炼的优质钢和合金钢，已经有240多种；我国高炉和平炉的利用系数已经达到苏联1952年的水平。在理论科学方面，我国在数学、物理学、有机化学、生物学的若干部门中的成就，也受到了世界科学界的重视，其中一部分已经对生产的实践有了贡献。
    但是整个说来，我国的科学和技术的状况仍然是很落后的。不但世界科学的很多最新成就，我们还没有能够掌握和利用，而且就是目前我国建设中的许多复杂的技术问题，我们也还不能离开苏联专家而独立解决。可是直到最近以前，我们对于提高我国科学和技术水平的问题，还没有作出全面规划；甚至现有的力量，也还没有完全有效地利用。技术科学上的落后同理论科学基础的薄弱是分不开的，而正是在科学研究方面，我们投入的力量最少。
    从以上的简单叙述可以看出：我们的成绩很大，但是还有不少的缺点。
    那么，我们在知识分子问题上应该采取怎样的方针呢？应该防止和纠正什么倾向呢？
    目前在知识分子问题上的主要倾向是宗派主义，但是同时也存在着麻痹迁就的倾向。前一种倾向是：低估了知识界在政治上和业务上的巨大进步，低估了他们在我国社会主义事业中的重大作用，不认识他们是工人阶级的一部分，认为反正生产依靠工人，技术依靠苏联专家，因而不认真执行党的知识分子政策，不认真研究和解决有关知识分子方面的问题；对于怎样充分地动员和发挥知识分子的力量，怎样进一步改造知识分子、扩大知识分子的队伍、提高知识分子的业务能力等迫切问题，漠不关心。后一种倾向是：只看到知识界的进步而不看到他们的缺点，对他们过高地估计，不加区别地盲目信任，甚至对坏分子也不加警惕，因而不去对他们进行教育和改造工作，或者虽然看到他们的缺点，但是由于存在着各种不应有的顾虑，因而不敢对他们进行教育和改造工作。这两种倾向在形式上是相反的，而实际的结果却都是一种右倾保守主义，都是放弃领导，缺乏积极的斗争精神，都妨碍着我们正确地解决知识分子问题和科学文化问题，都妨碍着我国社会主义事业的发展。
    我们必须同时反对这两种不正确的倾向。我们既不能对知识界的现有力量加以忽略，更不认为可以满足；既不能无限期地依赖苏联专家，更不能放松对苏联和其他国家的先进的科学技术进行最有效的学习。我们所应该采取的唯一正确的方针，就是为了使我国的社会主义建设事业进行得又多、又快、又好、又省，必须尽一切努力最充分地动员和发挥知识分子的现有力量，同时尽一切努力尽可能迅速地给以进一步的改造、扩大和提高，使这种改造、扩大和提高的速度和规模能够真正符合我们国家的各方面伟大发展的巨人式的步伐。
        （二）
    最充分地动员和发挥知识分子的现有力量，不但是我国目前紧张的建设事业所必需的，而且也是对知识界加以进一步的改造、扩大和提高的前提。
    一般地说，知识分子是在我们党的领导下被大量地动员起来了。要不然，我们前面说的知识分子的巨大进步，和他们对于国家的巨大贡献，就都是不可思议的了。我们必须首先肯定这一点，这是事物的主要方面。
    但是在我们的工作中，也的确存在着不少缺点，包含一些严重的缺点。在目前社会主义建设和改造的高潮当中，需要我们加强领导，迅速地克服这些缺点，才能更充分地动员和发挥知识分子的力量。
    为了最充分地动员和发挥知识分子的力量，第一，应该改善对于他们的使用和安排，使他们能够发挥他们对于国家有益的专长。
    在知识分子的使用和安排方面，我们在大多数的情形下都做得不坏。许多知识分子已经在国家建设中负担了很多很重大的任务，而他们的能力在实践中也不断地得到了提高。
    但是究竟不能说，我们已经把知识分子使用和安排得都恰当了，而没有闲置任何力量。例如在许多机关里，因为工作分配得不适当，或者工作组织得不好，也还有使少数知识分子“闲得发慌”的情形，而这些知识分子往往正是因为有某种专门知识，才被分配到这些机关里来的。这种浪费国家最宝贵的财产的情形，必须加以消灭。又如在全国高等学校里，还有很少数教师没有开课。这些人里面有一些并不是不能开课，或者只需要组织他们学习一下就可以开课，这就应该给他们开课；如果确实不能开课，也应该设法分配给他们所能担任的工作，例如编译工作、出版工作、图书馆工作等，而不应该让他们闲着。又如在社会上也还有极少数失业而还有相当劳动力的知识分子，也应该根据情况，由地方或者由中央给他们分配一定的工作。
    有些地方，在对知识分子的安排和使用上，用非所学的情形也还存在。有一部分科学家，本人愿意作科学研究工作，也以作科学研究工作对国家最有利，却被分配作机关行政工作或者学校行政工作。还有一部分专家，由于工作分配中的错误，完全没有理由地被指定担任他们所没有学过的工作，有时今天叫干这个，明天又叫干那个，可是就不让他们调回本行。根据国务院第四办公室就轻工业部的所属五个单位统计，这种用非所学的情况，在高级知识分子中就约占10％，这是多么严重的损失！我们必须采取坚决的步骤，来纠正这种对待人材的官僚主义、宗派主义和本位主义的错误，以便把专门人材用在最需要的地方。
    为了最充分地动员和发挥知识分子的力量，第二，应该对于所使用的知识分子有充分的了解，给他们以应得的信任和支持，使他们能够积极地进行工作。
    知识分子对于我们所给予的信任和支持，一般地是满意的，但是我们仍然应该看到我们工作中的缺点。在对于知识分子的信任问题上，如前所说，一种倾向是在政治上和业务上不加区别地过分地信任，以至把一些国家的机密没有必要地告诉给一些不相干的人或者泄露给一些不可靠的人，或者对于完全不称职的人加以重用，使工作遭到损失。这种情形是存在的，必须加以纠正。另一种倾向是没有给他们应有的信任，例如可以去的工厂不让他们去，可以看的资料不让他们看。这种情形也是存在的，也必须加以纠正。国家的机密必须无条件地保守，任何放松都是不允许的；问题是在正确地划清机密的界限，而不要任意地扩大机密的范围，使工作受到损失，使工作人员遇到困难。同时，对于知识分子的历史要有一个正确的估计和了解，以免一部分人由于“历史复杂”而受到长时期的不应有的怀疑。现在的高级知识分子中许多人历史是比较复杂的，这并不奇怪。但是只有少数人有政治问题，只有极少数人有现行的政治问题。不少有历史问题没有作出结论的知识分子，是由于领导同志没有认真负责、实事求是地弄清他们的问题，因而使问题长期迁延不决。应该集中比较强的力量，分别轻重缓急，尽可能迅速地清理他们的悬案，以利于今后对他们的使用。
    党外的知识分子除了需要应得的信任，还需要应得的支持。这就是说，应该让他们有职有权，应该尊重他们的意见，应该重视他们的业务研究和工作成果，应该提倡和发扬在社会主义建设中的学术讨论，应该使他们的创造和发明能够得到试验和推广的机会。有少数党团员不尊重他们上级的党外知识分子的领导，这种情形，我们应该负责加以纠正。
    对于一部分知识分子信任和支持不够，这是我们有些同志在知识分子问题上的宗派主义的主要表现。不少的同志还不习惯于同党外知识分子遇事商量，并在事前给以及时的指导和帮助。有的同志对于党外知识分子甚至采取敬而远之的态度。这样，彼此既缺乏了解，也就容易形成隔膜。但是，他们是我们国家的重要工作人员，他们的工作好坏直接地影响着国家的建设，所以我们有责任学会用同志的态度去接近他们，正确地了解他们，从而给他们以指导和帮助，使他们能够在工作中发挥积极的作用。
    为了最充分地动员和发挥知识分子的力量，第三，应该给知识分子以必要的工作条件和适当的待遇。
    知识分子目前的工作条件和待遇，比解放以前有了很大的改善。但是也像前面所说的一样，这一方面也还有一些急待解决的问题。
    在知识分子的工作条件方面，目前的一个重要问题是他们中间的许多人不能最有效地支配自己的工作时间。许多知识分子深感他们用在非业务性会议和行政事务上的时间太多，这些会议和有许多事务本来是可以不要他们参加的。差不多愈是著名的科学家、文学家和艺术家，被各种会议、事务和社会活动所占去的时间愈多，这是我国文化战线上的一个严重现象。中央认为，必须保证他们至少有六分之五的工作日（即每周40小时）用在自己的业务上，其余的时间可以用在政治学习、必要的会议和社会活动方面。这个要求，应该坚决贯彻实现。知识分子参加社会活动是有益的，目前的缺点是这些活动往往集中在少数人身上。今后应该加以调整，尽可能使多数人可以参加，对于大家不成为负担。有不少专家兼职太多，也应该迅速地加以调整。
    一部分知识分子在工作中感觉缺乏必要的图书资料和工作设备，或者缺乏适当的助手，以致工作效率很低。这种情形确实是存在的。例如许多拥有大量图书资料的单位，没有充分重视这些宝贵财产，没有派适当干部去进行整理，因而使一些专家不能够利用这些图书资料进行研究。造成这种现象的主要原因是我们对于他们的需要不熟悉，或者虽然听说了多次，而没有负责地给以解决。有些工作人员不愿意为这些“小事情”麻烦，这是错误的。这不是“小事情”，我们应该迅速地认真地解决这些问题。
    知识分子的生活待遇，一般地说比解放以前已经有了改善，但是为了使高级知识分子能够把更多的精力用于工作，他们的生活待遇应该适当地提高。一部分高级知识分子为了日常生活琐事，往往不必要地费去太多的时间，这应该看作是国家劳动力的损失。有些高级知识分子的居住条件太差，在北京和其他人口增加特别快的城市，都有一家几口合住一间小屋的情形。他们的休息娱乐生活也组织得不好。所有这些问题，都应该由主管的部门认真地加以解决。
    为了更好地解决知识分子的生活待遇问题，主要地需要从三方面着手：第一，应该教育各有关单位的行政管理人员从思想上重视知识分子的生活条件，特别是要打破那种只注意行政负责人的生活，而对于知识分子就觉得“你有什么值得照顾，我为什么要侍候你”一类的错误观念。只要这样，问题就可以差不多解决一半。第二，应该教育各有关单位的工会组织和消费合作社组织努力扩大为本单位的知识分子服务。工会的会费应该在很大的程度上用于本单位的文化活动和物质福利事业。工会的工作人员应该深入群众，用顽强的精神为本单位的会员解决各种生活困难，这应该是各种知识分子工会的一项重要任务。第三，应该根据按劳取酬的原则，适当地调整知识分子的工资，使他们所得的工资多少同他们对于国家所作的贡献大小相适应，消除工资制度中的平均主义倾向和其他不合理现象。此外，有少数不属于国家工作人员范围的知识分子，例如一部分戏曲艺人，国画家和中医，目前收入比较少，这种问题也应该使主管部门另行设法解决。
    有关知识分子生活待遇的另一个重要问题是升级制度。我们现在的升级制度有很多不合理的地方：等级多而等距小；高等学校毕业生的等级太低；没有确定的升级办法和升级标准；许多单位几年不评级，因此也就有一部分人没有能够升级。这种不合理的升级制度，大大地妨碍了知识分子在业务上的上进心，特别是妨碍了新生力量的培养和一般知识分子的提拔。这个制度必须迅速地加以修改。此外，关于学位、学衔、知识界的荣誉称号、发明创造和优秀著作奖励等制度，也是鼓励知识分子上进和刺激科学文化进步的一个重要方法。这些制度正在由有关部门拟定，应该在最近期间确定公布。
    对于知识分子的政治待遇，也有一些地方需要加以改善。这里的主要问题，是要消除许多单位对于知识分子的政治生活的不关心。有些知识分子埋怨我们一个长报告要他们听好几次，但是更多的知识分子埋怨我们一年不让他们听一次报告。同样，有许多社会活动，有人觉得参加太多，但是更多的人认为，如果他们能够得到参加一次的机会，他们将感到很大的鼓舞。这些方面，我们都应该注意加以适当的调整。此外，我们还应该在工作人员中进行教育，让他们懂得怎样正确地对待知识分子，而不要在无意之间伤害了他们的正当的自尊心，这种自尊心是任何一个正直的劳动者都应该有的。
    以上所说的，是充分地动员和发挥知识分子力量的一些必要的条件。当然，为了这个目的，还需要给他们以教育和改造，给他们以政治上和业务上的领导，这我们在后面还要谈到。但是，无论如何，以上所说的这些条件都是必不可少的。有了这些条件，才便于更充分地动员知识分子在伟大的祖国建设事业中发挥力量，也才便于推动他们在政治上和业务上的进步。
        （三）
    继续帮助知识分子进行自我改造，是党在过渡时期的重要的政治任务之一。
    我国现在正处在过渡时期，这是最深刻的社会改造的时期。几千年的生产资料私有制，要一变而成为社会主义的公有制；几千年的剥削制度，要从此永远消灭；所有的人们，都要变成为不同类型的劳动者。这种翻天覆地的变化，不能不在我国社会生活和思想领域的各个方面，引起激烈的反应。因此，这个时期的一切社会问题，就中也包括知识分子问题，都不能离开阶级斗争来观察。知识分子在政治上的各种分野和变化，正是阶级斗争的进展在知识分子队伍中的反映。我们已经看到，在目前的知识分子中，还有百分之几的反革命分子和其他坏分子（例如骗子和流氓），这些人是需要从知识分子队伍中清除的。除此以外，还有少数思想上反对社会主义和完全不了解社会主义的人们。对于这些人，应该批评他们的错误思想，并且尽可能争取他们转变到社会主义方面来。
    肃清暗藏在知识界中的反革命分子的工作，在过去一年中已经得到巨大的成绩。我们应该继续努力，争取在今后两年内达到基本上肃清反革命分子的目的。
    在同反革命分子作斗争的时候，不要把只同反革命分子有过普通社会关系的人牵连在一起，这一点很重要，因为知识分子中这样的人是很多的。过去如果曾经不正确地把他们同反革命分子混淆在一起，应该向他们解释清楚。对于只在历史上同反革命组织有过关系，解放以后确实已经改变立场的人，在他们作了适当的交代以后，也应该同普通的人一样看待。
    我们在前面说到，在一部分知识分子同我们党之间，还存在着某种隔膜。我们必须主动地努力消除这种隔膜。但是这种隔膜常常是从两方面来的：一方面是由于我们的同志没有去接近他们，了解他们；而另一方面，却是
  由于一部分知识分子对于社会主义采取了保留态度、甚至反对态度。在我们的企业、学校、机关里，在社会上，都还有这样的知识分子：他们在共产党和国民党之间、中国人民和帝国主义之间不分敌我；他们不满意党和人民政府的政策和措施，留恋资本主义甚至留恋封建主义；他们反对苏联，不愿意学习苏联；他们拒绝学习马克思列宁主义，并且诋毁马克思列宁主义；他们轻视劳动，轻视劳动人民，轻视劳动人民出身的干部，不愿意同工
  人农民和工农干部接近；他们不愿意看见新生力量的生长，认为进步分子是投机；他们不但常常在知识分子和党之间制造纠纷和对立，而且也在知识分子中间制造纠纷和对立；他们妄自尊大，自以为天下第一，不能够接受任何人的领导和任何人的批评；他们否认人民的利益、社会的利益，看一切问题都从个人的利益出发，合乎自己利益的就赞成，不合乎自己利益的就反对。当然，所有这些错误一应俱全的人，在现在的知识分子中是很少数；但是有上述一种或者几种错误的人，就不是很少数。不但落后分子，就是一部分中间分子，也常有以上所说的某一些错误观点。胸怀狭窄、高傲自大、看
  问题从个人的利益出发的毛病，在进步分子中也还不少。这样的知识分子如果不改变立场，即使我们努力同他们接近，他们同我们之间也还是会有隔膜的。
    因此，我们不但应该改造落后分子，而且对于中间分子也应该尽可能地教育他们脱离中间状态，变为进步分子；对于进步分子，也必须帮助他们继续进步，帮助他们努力学习马克思列宁主义，扫除他们思想上的资本主义、个人主义和唯心主义的影响。我们应该在高级知识分子中间培养出大批的坚决为社会主义奋斗的红色专家。目前有些高级知识分子已经成为红色专家，还有很多人具有这种愿望。我们应该热情地帮助他们进行自我改造，实现他们的这种愿望，任何排斥和歧视他们的态度都是错误的。
    总起来说，彻底肃清暗藏在知识界中的反革命分子，使落后分子减少到最低限度，使中间分子尽可能地变为进步分子，使进步分子成为完全社会主义的知识分子——这就是我们在目前阶段继续改造知识分子的斗争纲领。
    关于知识分子的改造，我们已经有了丰富的经验和巨大的成绩。因此，关于知识分子能否改造的问题，已经不需要详细的讨论了。我们现在的任务，是总结过去的经验，克服过去工作中的某些缺点，使今后的工作能够进行得更有计划。我们既然看到知识分子中的各种政治的分野，就应该大体上按照这种状况，分别地定出教育进步分子、中间分子、落后分子的计划，采取各种已经证明有效的办法，加以实施。
    知识分子的改造通常经过三条道路：一条是经过社会生活的观察和实践；一条是经过他们自己的业务的实践；一条是经过一般的理论的学习。这三个方面是互相联系的，一个人的思想的转变常常在三方面都受了影响。但是一般地说来，社会生活的教育作用最为广泛和直接。大家知道，许多知识分子的思想转变都是从参加土地改革和抗美援朝开始的。近几年对于工厂农村的参观，也极有力地帮助了知识分子获得对于社会主义的信心。但是我们还没有有系统地组织这个工作，特别是许多中间分子和落后分子常常没有放在我们的计划之内。在今后，应该把组织知识分子参观社会主义建设作为一项重要任务，加以通盘的安排，使凡是没有参观过的人在最近几年中都得到参观的机会。
    业务的实践对于知识分子的思想改造也有重大的作用。过去几年中，教学方法的改革和苏联教材的采用，使许多原来不相信苏联和不相信马克思列宁主义的教师改变了认识。同样，我国工农群众在生产技术上的创造，苏联科学技术在我国的推广，苏联专家的实际示范，也使很多科学技术人员信服了社会主义制度的优越性。今后应该继续发展这一方面的经验。但是在学习苏联的问题上，过去也有过于急躁、生硬和机械化的缺点，有的同志甚至武断地否定资本主义国家的科学技术成果。这些缺点今后应该避免。
    马克思列宁主义的学习，对于确立知识分子的革命的人生观和科学的世界观，具有决定的意义。但是现在有些地方这种学习组织得不好，或者是指导的人水平太低，或者是学习的计划和方法不合于高级知识分子的需要。今后应该克服这些缺点，按照自愿和联系业务的原则，规定一些必修的马克思列宁主义的基本课程，着重采取自学、夜大学、函授学校、科学讨论会等方法，来帮助知识分子学习理论。
    知识分子的改造既然是阶级斗争的一种反映，这个改造过程本身就不可能没有相当的斗争。首先，我们必须要求所有的知识分子站在爱国的立场上，遵守宪法，分清敌我的界限。如果一个人违反爱国的立场，违反宪法，在言论和行为上混淆敌我，那末，人们不同这样的人进行斗争是不可想像的。其次，在社会主义的思想和资本主义的思想、唯物主义的思想和唯心主义的思想之间，也不可能没有尖锐的斗争。知识分子思想改造的过程，同知识界思想斗争的发展是分不开的。解放以来，党所领导的思想改造运动和对于唯心主义思想的批判，对于知识分子的进步产生了很大的效果。在思想斗争中应该注意的是，一个人的思想的转变，必须通过他本人的自觉。用粗暴的方法进行思想改造，是不能解决问题的。但是用粗暴的方法对待科学家和科学问题的现象，最近还有发现，各地必须注意纠正。此外，有的人虽然在思想上坚持自己的错误，但是只要他并不在言论和行动上反对人民，甚至还愿意用自己的知识和精力为人民工作，那末，我们在批判他的错误思想的同时，就还要善于耐心地等待和帮助他逐步地觉悟起来。
    为了帮助知识分子求得进步，党的领导者同他们进行直接的接触有重要的意义。很多知识分子期望我们能够在思想上政治上多给他们以帮助和批评，并且觉得我们给的这种帮助太少了。有不少的知识分子，不但很难接触地方党委的领导同志，甚至同本单位的党委委员住在一起，也很难有机会谈话。他们说我们对他们是“使用多，帮助少”，或者是“只使用，不帮助”。还有人说，我们的工作人员只在三件事上找他们：（一）调动工作；（二）交代历史；（三）犯了错误。这些批评是尖锐的，应该引起我们注意。我们应该把同他们进行思想上政治上的谈话，对他们进行同志式的批评，定在改造知识分子的计划以内。组织一些座谈会同他们交换意见，这是他们所欢迎的，以后应该经常举行。此外，还应该按照具体情况，吸收一些党外的知识分子列席一定的党组会和支部会，让他们进一步了解党的意图，接受党的教育。
    为了帮助知识分子的进步，除了依靠共产党员以外，还要组织已经占知识分子中40％左右的进步分子参加工作。青年团、工会和各民主党派在过去几年中，在这一方面作了不少工作，今后应该更有计划地使用它们的力量。
    由于我们在改造知识分子方面已经有了更多的经验，又有了进步力量的支持，而一般知识分子在祖国的突飞猛进的建设中，又愈来愈深刻地受着社会主义的教育，他们的进步必然会比过去几年更快。只要全国每一个单位对于知识分子改造都作出计划，包括1956年到1962年的7年计划和年度计划，坚持地实行起来，那么，我们一定可以在第二个五年计划期末，使积极为社会主义奋斗并接受马克思列宁主义基本观点的进步分子，在高级知识分子中占到四分之三以上，而使落后分子降到5％左右。
    关于在知识分子中吸收党员的工作，也应该作出计划。现在已经有很多的进步的知识分子要求入党。例如，重工业部有色冶金设计院的工程技术人员共有1，920人，申请入党的有605人，占31.5％。天津六所高等学校讲师以上教师291人，申请入党的有106人，占36.4％。华北农业科学研究所研究人员131人，申请入党的有53人，占40％。但是，过去几年中我们很少在他们中间吸收党员，这是一种关门主义的倾向。这种倾向必须纠正。当然，必须注意严格按照党员条件接收党员，但是可以相信，在这些申请入党的人中间，合乎党员条件的是不少的。估计到高级知识分子中进步力量的增大，估计到新生力量不断地加入高级知识分子的队伍，我们认为，计划在1962年做到党员占高级知识分子总数三分之一左右，是适当的。
    实现以上的规划，我国知识界的思想政治状况就将有进一步的根本变化。我们将有可能在我国过渡时期基本上完成改造知识分子这样一个特定的历史任务。在那个时候以后，知识分子同所有的人一样，仍然要在学习和实践中不断地改造自己，并且要在新的水平上，向更高的进步的标准前进。但是，那是一种经常性质的任务了。
          （四）
    为着适应国家建设的急速发展的需要，我们的知识分子队伍必须在数量上加以扩大，在业务水平上加以提高。
    我国的科学文化力量目前是比苏联和其他世界大国小得多，同时在质量上也要低得多，这是同我们六亿人口的社会主义大国的需要很不相称的。我们必须急起直追，力求尽可能迅速地扩大和提高我国的科学文化力量，而在不太长的时间里赶上世界先进水平。这是我们党和全国知识界、全国人民的一个伟大的战斗任务。
    我们经常说我国科学文化落后，但是并不经常去研究究竟落后在那些地方。同志们！我想在这里稍微多说一点科学方面的事情，这不但因为科学是关系我们的国防、经济和文化各方面的有决定性的因素，而且因为世界科学在最近二三十年中，有了特别巨大和迅速的进步，这些进步，把我们抛在科学发展的后面很远。
    现代科学技术正在一日千里地突飞猛进。生产过程正在逐步地实现全盘机械化、全盘自动化和远距离操纵，从而使劳动生产率提高到空前未有的水平。各种高温、高压、高速和超高温、超高压、超高速的机器正在设计和生产出来。陆上、水上和空中的运输机器的航程和速率日益提高，高速飞机已经超过音速。技术上的这些进步，要求各种具备新的特殊性能的材料，因而各种新的金属和合金材料，以及用化学方法人工合成的材料，正在不断地生产出来，以满足这些新的需要。各个生产部门的生产技术和工艺规程，正在日新月异地变革，保证了生产过程的进一步加速和强化，资源的有用成份的最充分利用，原材料的最大节约，和产品质量的不断提高。
    科学技术新发展中的最高峰是原子能的利用。原子能给人类提供了无比强大的新的动力泉源，给科学的各个部门开辟了革新的远大前途。同时，由于电子学和其他科学的进步而产生的电子自动控制机器（例如每秒钟可以做15，000个数学演算的电子计算机等），已经可以开始有条件地代替一部分特定的脑力劳动，就像其他机器代替体力劳动一样，从而大大提高了自动化技术的水平。这些最新的成就，使人类面临着一个新的科学技术和工业革命的前夕。这个革命，正如布尔加宁同志所说过的，“就它的意义来说，远远超过蒸汽和电的出现而产生的工业革命”。
    我们必须赶上这个世界先进科学水平。我们要记着，当我们向前赶的时候，别人也在继续迅速地前进。因此我们必须在这个方面付出最紧张的劳动。只有掌握了最先进的科学，我们才能有巩固的国防，才能有强大的先进的经济力量，才能有充分的条件同苏联和其他人民民主国家在一起，无论在和平的竞赛中或者在敌人所发动的侵略战争中，战胜帝国主义国家。
    现在还很难确切地估计，需要多长时间，才能使我们的科学赶上世界先进水平。但是我们现在就必须提出这样一个任务，就是要在第三个五年计划期末，使我国最急需的科学部门接近世界先进水平，使外国的最新成就，经过我们自己的努力很快地就可以达到。有了这个基础，我们就可以进一步解决赶上世界水平的问题。
    为了完成这个伟大的任务，我们必须首先打破那种缺乏民族自信心的依赖思想。“中国在科学方面的落后反正不能马上改变，反正需要靠苏联的援助。”不错，我们需要靠苏联的援助来改变我们的落后。但是我们应该用什么办法来利用这种援助呢？一种办法是没有全面规划，头痛医头，脚痛医脚，碰到什么问题就去请教苏联。派到苏联去学习的，不是科学家，而大部分是中学毕业生。其结果是一辈子不能脱离依赖和模仿的状态，是无限期地加重苏联科学界的负担，是妨害了我国科学的有计划的迅速的发展，也就是影响了整个社会主义阵营科学力量、经济力量、防卫力量增长的速度。另一种办法是作出全面规划，分清缓急本末，有系统地利用苏联科学的最新成果，尽可能迅速地赶上苏联水平。这就是说，除了紧迫任务请求苏联援助、并从苏联援助中学习技术以外，对于凡是我国科学上需要向苏联学习的部门，都有计划地派出比较成熟的科学人材向苏联学习，或者请苏联专家来我国帮助我们建立科学研究的基础，务求最短期间可以在苏联已经达到的水平上，在国内展开继续研究和培养干部的工作。这样，就可以最有效最合理地利用苏联的援助，促进我国科学的有计划的发展，使两国科学事业有可能比较快地建立互相协作的关系，也就是促进了整个社会主义阵营科学力量、经济力量、防卫力量的增长。后一种办法是中苏两国科学家所多次建议的、也是我们所应该采取的唯一正确的办法。
    为了有系统地提高我国科学水平，还必须打破近视的倾向。在理论工作和技术工作之间，在长远需要和目前需要之间，分配的力量应该保持适当的比例，并且形成正确的分工和合作，以免有所偏废。在过去几年中间，我国的各种工作都在开始，我们在目前需要和技术工作方面多投一些力量，而对于长远需要和理论工作方面注意得比较少，这是难免的，也是可以理解的。但是到了现在，如果我们还不及时地加强对于长远需要和理论工作的注意，那么，我们就要犯很大的错误。没有一定的理论科学的研究作基础，技术上就不可能有根本性质的进步和革新。但是理论力量的生长，总是要比技术力量的生长慢一些，而理论工作的效果一般也是间接的，不容易一下子就看出来。正因为这样，有许多同志现在还有一种近视的倾向，他们不肯在科学研究方面拿出必要的力量，并且经常要求科学家给他们解决比较简单的技术应用和生产操作方面的问题。当然，理论决不可以脱离实际，任何脱离实际的“理论研究”是我们所必须反对的，但是目前的主要倾向，却是对于理论研究的忽视。这种情况，不但表现在自然科学方面，同样地也表现在社会科学方面。目前我们在社会科学方面分配的力量，比在自然科学方面分配的力量，按照我们国家的需要说来，更加薄弱得不相称。例如中国科学院的学部委员，在自然科学方面是172个人，目前实际上能用大部分时间进行科学工作的有半数以上；在社会科学方面是51个人，目前实际上能用大部分时间进行科学研究工作的却只有几个人！
    上述的这两种倾向是互为因果、互相结合的。我们必须彻底纠正这些不正确的倾向，改变这些不利于科学发展的状况。
    国务院现在已经委托国家计划委员会负责，会同各有关部门，在3个月内，制定从1956年到1967年科学发展的远景计划。在制定这个远景计划的时候，必须按照可能和需要，把世界科学的最先进的成就，尽可能迅速地介绍到我国的科学部门、国防部门、生产部门和教育部门中来，把我国科学界所最短缺而又是国家建设所最急需的门类尽可能迅速地补足起来，使12年后，我国这些门类的科学和技术水平，可以接近苏联和其他世界大国。
    什么是最迅速最有效地达到这个目的的道路呢？
    这样的道路就是：第一，按照我们所最急需的门类，最迅速地派遣若干组专家、优秀的科学工作人员和优秀的大学毕业生到苏联和其他国家去作一年到两年的实习，或者当研究生，回国以后立即在科学院和政府各部分别建立发展这些科学和技术的基础，并且大量培养新的干部。同时，按照需要，每年陆续派人去实习和研究。第二，对于一部分学科，向苏联和其他有关的国家聘请若干组专家，请他们负责在最短期内帮助我们在科学院和有关各部门建立科学研究机构，培养干部，或者同我国科学界进行全面的合作。第三，有计划地组织大批科学工作人员和技术人员向现在在中国的苏联专家学习，把他们当作导师来利用，而不要当作普通工作人员来利用。在苏联援助我国建设的156项企业的建设和生产过程中，有系统地组织大批技术人员研究和掌握其中的新的技术原理，并且加以迅速的传授。第四，集中最优秀的科学力量和最优秀的大学毕业生到科学研究方面。用极大的力量来加强中国科学院，使它成为领导全国提高科学水平、培养新生力量的火车头。第五，各个高等学校中的科学力量，占全国科学力量的绝大部分，必须在全国科学发展计划的指导之下，大力发展科学研究工作，并且大量地培养合乎现代水平的科学和技术的新生力量。第六，政府各部，特别是地质、工业、农业、水利、运输、国防、卫生各部门，应该迅速地建立和加强必要的研究机构，同科学院进行合理的分工和合作，共同扩大科学界的队伍，并且负责把世界科学的最新成就，有计划地、有系统地介绍到实际应用中去，以便尽可能迅速地用世界最新的技术把我们国家的各方面装备起来。
    为了认真地而不是空谈地向现代科学进军，我们必须抓紧时间。一年的时间是很容易在空谈和拖延不决中间浪费了的。因此，党中央要求：在今年4月底以前，必须确定科学发展的远景计划，适合于这个远景计划的今明两年的具体计划，以及为了实现这个远景计划和今明两年计划需要马上调集的第一批科学力量（包括需要派遣出国的科学人员的名单，需要聘请苏联专家的人数，需要由其他岗位调到科学研究岗位的人数和主要人员名单等），并且尽一切可能，争取在今年6月底以前实现派遣和调动的计划。关于在全国高等学校中扩大科学研究工作和扩大培养科学力量的计划，必须在今年暑假以后，就着手加以实现。
    为了实现向科学进军的计划，我们必须为发展科学研究准备一切必要的条件。在这里，具有首要意义的是要使科学家得到必要的图书、档案资料、技术资料和其他工作条件。必须增加各个研究机关和高等学校的图书费并加以合理的使用，加强图书馆、档案馆、博物馆的工作，极大地改善外国书刊的进口工作，并且使现有的书刊得到合理的分配。必须扩大外国语的教学，并且扩大外国重要书籍的翻译工作。
    以上所说的原则，一般地也同样适用于文化教育的其他部门。一切文化教育部门都应该作出从1956到1967年的发展规划，并且采取最有效的措施加以实现。
    我们的发展科学文化力量的计划，必须是一个既提高而又扩大的计划，因为不但我们的国家是一个大国，必须有一定的数量才能适应各方面的需要，而且质量一般地也只能在一定的数量的基础上产生。
    为了扩大我国的科学文化力量，首先必须按计划增加高等学校学生的名额，还必须注意培养现有的一般知识分子，不断地提高他们的业务水平。他们不但是高级知识分子极为重要的后备军和合作者，而且如前所说，在数量上比高级知识分子多得多；他们分布在全国各地区和各个工作部门中，对于国家建设担负着巨大的责任。中央各个部门和各省市必须分别定出专门的计划，帮助他们的进修，使他们的业务能力得到迅速的增长，并且把他们中间的优秀分子提拔到高级知识分子的队伍中去。
        （五）
    我们党正在胜利地解决着农业合作化和手工业合作化的问题，并且正在胜利地解决着资本主义工商业改造的问题。全党和全国劳动人民，正在为着提前和超额完成五年计划而努力。全国人民充满着胜利的信心和斗争的积极性。随着汹涌澎湃的社会主义经济建设的高潮而来的，将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。在这个时候，我们把关于知识分子的一系列问题加以全面的解决，这对于我们的社会主义改造事业和社会主义建设事业，无疑是非常必要的。
    在我们所提出的关于知识分子问题的任务中，不能说没有一些困难。但是这些困难，不会比我们改造五亿农民和改造全国资本主义工商业者更加困难，不会比我们实现第一个五年计划更加困难。我们党在过去六年中，在领导知识分子和领导科学文化事业方面，已经得到了巨大的成就。现在我们是比过去更有经验更有办法了，在过去的经验的基础上，我们党一定能够领导知识分子在科学文化事业中取得新的更大的胜利。那种认为党不能够领导知识分子进行科学文化建设的想法，是毫无根据的。
    问题是在善于学习。无论中央各部门和各地区，都必须学会更好地领导知识分子和领导科学文化事业。我们不应该设想，既然我们是共产党员，我们就天然地会领导知识分子进行文化建设，我们就天然地不会犯错误。这是一种很危险的想法。而在有些地方，我们有一些同志正是因为抱着这种狂妄的态度，使党的工作遭到了损失。我们对待任何问题，都必须坚持“知之为知之，不知为不知”的老实态度，不懂决不要装懂，但是必须由不懂变为懂。我们党必须培养出一大批精通科学和文化各部门知识的干部。只要我们认真地钻进去，我们就一定可以学会。
    在报告里提到的各项任务，许多是需要由中央统一解决的。关于这些问题，我们提议作如下的分工：
    关于对待知识分子的各种行政性质的问题，因为需要作一些统一的规定和管理，国务院准备设一个中国专家局来负责处理。但是在这个机构成立以前，各有关部门就应该根据中央的指示，立即着手解决知识分子方面的各项问题。在这个机构成立以后，各个部门也不能减轻他们所应负的直接处理的责任，因为专家局一般地只负责解决那些不便于由一个部门单独处理的问题。专家局在关于高级知识分子的各项行政性质的问题上，负有统一计划、统一调整、统一检查督促的责任。对于各部门在高级知识分子问题上处理不当的地方，专家局有权按照一定的程序加以纠正。
    关于对待知识分子的各种政治性质的问题，关于在知识分子中继续进行思想改造和处理有关反革命分子的问题，也由各个有关部门直接负责，而由中央宣传部负责进行统一的监督。中央宣传部应该经常检查各部门各地区执行中央关于知识分子政策的状况，检查它们的工作计划和执行计划的状况，克服它们的工作中的缺点，传播它们的工作中的先进经验，并且及时地向中央提出问题和建议。
    在知识分子中吸收党员的工作由中央组织部负责。知识分子中的民主党派工作由中央统一战线工作部负责。知识分子中的工会工作由全国总工会负责。但是在解决这些工作中的重要问题的时候，应该同中央宣传部联系。
    为了加强领导，处理和检查有关知识分子的问题，各级党委和各个部门都应该分别指定适当的机构担负经常的责任，并且要定期地召集一些专门的会议，经常地交流经验，不断地争取工作状况的改善。
    同志们！我们相信，经过我们的工作，知识分子将更进一步地团结在党的周围，并且在伟大的社会主义事业中更积极地贡献他们的力量。全国工人、农民、知识分子在社会主义事业中所形成的联盟，将随着我们的工作的发展，而一天比一天更巩固，更强大。依靠这个联盟，我们一定可以在不很长的时间内，把我们的国家建设成为一个完全现代化的、富强的社会主义工业大国，一定可以在不很长的时间内，实现毛泽东同志的伟大号召——“我们将以一个有高度文化的民族出现于世界”。
