Editor's Note: Dulles slandered our country at a press conference on the 11th, claiming that China did not grant Americans in China the right to return home quickly. We are now publishing a letter we recently received from a mother of two children. She condemns the U.S. government for obstructing her husband's return to China. How will Dulles, who is deaf, dumb, and a liar, answer this?

    Children Look Forward to Dad's Return
    —Letter from Wan Xizhen, Wife of Wang Hangjia—
    To the Editor:
    I am a mother of two children and a middle school teacher. My husband, Wang Hangjia, went to the United States to study in June 1948. He studied engineering at the University of Michigan. After obtaining his master's degree in the fall of 1949, he continued to study at the school. In the first half of 1950, he wrote to say he wanted to return to China. But after the summer of that year, he did not write for two or three months. Later, a letter came saying that he had contracted a lung disease and was not discharged from the hospital until the winter of 1951. Since being discharged, he has been working as a design engineer at a car company in Detroit, Michigan.
    Since that year, he has written to say that he needs to see a doctor every two weeks (later every three months) for a check-up. I find it very strange because my husband was very healthy before he went abroad. Is he really sick? I have seen in the newspapers that many Chinese students in the United States have been persecuted and threatened. I suspect that his going to the doctor every three months is an indication that he is being harassed by American agents.
    In recent years, his letters have been filled with feelings of longing for the motherland and his children. Since the beginning of the Sino-American ambassadorial talks, he has hoped in every letter that an agreement could be reached as soon as possible so that he could return to China soon. His classmate, Du Huanwen, returned to China last summer. He wrote to express his great joy and wrote a congratulatory poem, which included two lines saying:
    "Returning home after completing studies is the ambition of a man,
     I want to follow in his footsteps and whip my horse."
    He also asked me in the letter what things I wanted to buy for the children. Since then, I have been happily waiting for him to return. However, after the Sino-American ambassadorial talks reached an agreement on the exchange of civilians, he suddenly did not write for two months. I wrote several times to ask, but his replies were only a few words. This is obviously because he is being obstructed and threatened by the U.S. government and is not free to write letters.
    My husband is a Chinese man, he has children, and he wants to return to China, but the U.S. government will not let him return. I ask, is this the freedom of Chinese in the United States to return home that the U.S. government talks about? Recently, the U.S. government has proposed that Chinese students in the United States apply to go to Taiwan. This is extremely absurd. We will never allow the U.S. government to engage in such unethical and non-compliant behavior.
    My children have been separated from their father for eight years, and they miss him day and night. Now they are calling on the U.S. government to return their father. I request Ambassador Wang Bingnan in Geneva to ask the U.S. government to return the children's father for me.

    A Group of Students Protest the U.S. Government's Persecution of Chinese Students
    To the Editor:
    After reading the letter from Qian Xuesen and 68 other returned students from the United States published in the People's Daily on the 9th of this month, "Accusing the U.S. Government of Persecuting Chinese Students in the United States," we feel extremely angry about the various persecutions that the U.S. government has inflicted on Chinese students in the United States.
    The U.S. government's persecution of Chinese students not only violates the spirit of humanitarianism but also violates the agreement on the return of civilians between the two sides in the Sino-American talks.
    We express our deep condolences to the 68 returned students from the United States who finally returned to the motherland victoriously after facing numerous obstacles and persecutions; we express our utmost concern to the Chinese students in the United States who have been persecuted by the U.S. government but have not yet returned to China. At the same time, we firmly protest the U.S. government's detention and persecution of Chinese students in the United States and demand that it immediately stop this crime.
    It is the sacred right of Chinese students to request to return to their motherland, and the U.S. government is absolutely not allowed to infringe upon it.
    We firmly believe that this shameful act of the U.S. government will be condemned by the people of the world.
    Together with the people of the whole country, we firmly support the return requests of all Chinese students in the United States who are willing to return to China so that they can return to their motherland and reunite with their families as soon as possible and participate in socialist construction.

### 向美国政府要亲人

    向美国政府要亲人
    编者按：杜勒斯11日在记者招待会上，诬蔑我国没有给予在中国的美国人迅速返国的权利。现在我们把最近收到的一位两个孩子母亲的来信，发表于下。她谴责美国政府阻挠她的爱人回国。装聋作哑和信口雌黄的杜勒斯，对此将如何回答呢？
    孩子们盼望爸爸回国
    —王杭甲的爱人万席珍来信—
    编辑同志：
    我是两个孩子的母亲，也是一个中学教员。我的丈夫王杭甲在1948年6月到美国留学。他在密执安大学学工程。1949年秋得了硕士学位后，继续留校研究。1950年上半年，他来信说想回国。但这年夏季以后，有两三个月没有来信。后来信来了，说是得了肺病，到1951年冬才出病院。出院后一直到现在都在密执安州底特律城一家汽车公司当设计工程师。
    从那年起，他来信说每隔两星期（后来是每隔三个月）要到医生那里检查身体。我感到很奇怪，因为我丈夫出国前身体很健康，难道是真生病吗？我从报上看到了许多留美学生在美国受到了迫害和威胁，我猜想他每隔三个月去医生那里一次，是不是暗示受到美国特务的纠缠呢？
    这几年来，他每次来信，在字里行间都充满了想念祖国和孩子的情感。自中美大使级会谈开始后，他每次来信都希望会谈能尽早达成协议，以便早日回国。他的同学都焕文去年夏天回国，他来信表示高兴极了，并写了一首祝贺的诗，其中有两句说：
    “学成回国男儿志，
     我欲扬鞭步后尘。”
    他信中还问我要买些什么东西给孩子。自此以后，我愉快地等待着他回来。可是，在中美大使会谈关于交换平民问题达成协议后，他忽然两个月没有来信。我去信问了几次，他的回信也只有几句话。这显然是受到美国政府的阻挠和威胁，写信不自由的缘故了。
    我的丈夫是个中国人，他有儿女，他想回国，但是美国政府却不让他回国。试问这就是美国政府所谓在美国的中国人回国的自由吗？最近美国政府又提出要在美国的中国留学生申请去台湾。这真是荒谬之极。我们决不允许美国政府这种不讲道义和不遵守协议的行为。
    我的孩子与爸爸分别八年了，他们日夜想念爸爸，现在他们提出了向美国政府要回爸爸的呼声。我请求在日内瓦的王炳南大使，替我向美国政府要回孩子们的爸爸。

    一群学生抗议美国政府迫害中国留学生
    编辑同志：
    读了本月9日人民日报刊登的钱学森等68位回国留美学生“控诉美国政府迫害留美中国学生”的信后，我们对美国政府给予留美中国学生的种种迫害感到极大的愤怒。
    美国政府迫害中国留学生的行为不仅违反了人道主义精神，也破坏了中美会谈关于双方平民回国问题的协议。
    我们对遭到重重阻挠和迫害终于胜利回到祖国的68位留美同学表示深切的慰问；对遭到美国政府迫害而尚未回国的留美同学表示万分的关怀。同时，我们坚决抗议美国政府扣留和迫害中国留美学生的行为，要求立即停止这一罪行。
    中国留学生要求返回祖国是他们的神圣权利，决不允许美国政府侵犯。
    我们深信，美国政府这种可耻的行径将遭到全世界人民的谴责。
    我们和全国人民一起，坚决支持一切愿意回国的中国留美学生的回国要求，使他们能早日回到祖国和家人团聚，并参加社会主义建设。
