Striving for the Early Completion of the Yangtze River Bridge
    Zhou Ming Wan Qiang

    Recently, the workers constructing the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge made a decision: "Guarantee that trains pass over the Yangtze River Bridge ahead of schedule!" This will connect the major north-south transportation lines of our country – the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Yuehan Railway – ahead of schedule, playing an incalculable role in promoting the flow of materials in the motherland and supporting the cause of socialist construction.

    This decision immediately changed the face of the Yangtze River construction site. On the Yangtze River, which is turbulent in winter, six bridge piers are under construction simultaneously. Workers are also rushing to make two new steel cofferdams to start work on all eight bridge piers within two months. A 30-meter-high universal pile driver has been transported from the left bank to the front of the Yellow Crane Tower on the right bank to display its power, and a giant tower crane has been erected at the foot of Turtle Mountain on the left bank. Workers on both sides are pouring concrete for more than a dozen approach bridge piers and laying the roadbed and slope protection for the railway. According to the new plan, in 1956, they will build three bridge piers on the river, erect one span of steel beams, and complete all the railway bridge substructure works such as the bridge abutments, approach bridges, and overpasses on both banks. From the second half of 1956, they will also gradually draw out three bridge teams to undertake new bridge construction tasks.

    The "pipe pile drilling method" created by Soviet experts played a decisive role in the early completion of the Yangtze River Bridge. Using this "pipe pile drilling method," which no one in the world had ever used before, encountered many difficulties before the official start of construction. The drill bit was not suitable for the geological conditions of the Yangtze River, and the workers were not skilled in the operation. The first drilling machine took three months to drill only two holes, while the entire bridge required more than two hundred holes. The one-hundred-ton number eight cofferdam needed to be lifted and reinforced, but there was no lifting equipment with such a large capacity. According to preliminary calculations, lifting such a heavy cofferdam on the river for a week was absolutely not allowed by safety regulations. At this time, two attitudes appeared in the face of difficulties: one was to emphasize the heavy task, many difficulties, and insufficient strength, lacking confidence in completing the bridge on schedule; the other was to actively overcome difficulties, actively tap potential, and strive to complete the bridge ahead of schedule.

    How did things develop?

    Mechanical expert Prokhorov returned to Wuhan in the morning and went to the construction site in the afternoon to study the problem with the workers, adopting the suggestion of engineer Xiao Chuanren to modify the design of the drill bit. Expert Koskin helped the workers improve the operation method. As a result, the damage rate of one drill bit every 20 minutes was improved to continuous drilling of 11 piles of 35 meters without a single failure. Experts Kalbinsky and Tamanov devised a way to use four winches and three large crane ships to lift the No. 8 cofferdam, while implementing "division of labor by process" and "physical disclosure" to compress the planned time for reinforcing the No. 8 cofferdam to 36 hours. On the day the cofferdam was reinforced, the two experts stayed on the pier for a day and night, and finally completed the reinforcement and sinking of the No. 8 cofferdam in more than 20 hours ahead of schedule.

    With the specific help of Soviet experts, the Yangtze River Bridge construction site has undergone significant changes in just a few months. Initially, it took seven days to sink one pipe pile, but now it is possible to sink four pipes a day. In the early stage of drilling rock for the No. 1 bridge pier, it took more than a month, working day and night in three shifts, to drill only 5.3 centimeters, but now the average is more than 8 centimeters every eight-hour shift, reaching a maximum of 1.8 meters. Initially, it took more than two months to manufacture a cofferdam alone, but now it is possible to manufacture two cofferdams at the same time, each requiring only 20 days. Earthmoving workers have also increased from 0.8 cubic meters per shift to 2.5 cubic meters, and the railway soldiers on the Wuchang line have even reached five cubic meters per shift.

    Xiao Chuanren, who was still a technician in the Han River Railway Bridge project, is now independently responsible for the technical aspects of the foundation construction of the bridge piers on the left bank. Yin Wanshou, who was still a low-level engineer on the Han River Railway Bridge, is now serving as the deputy chief engineer on the right bank. In the technical office of the mechanical repair and leasing station, in addition to two middle-aged engineers, all are young people who have just graduated from school, with an average age of only 23 years old. However, under the guidance of experts, they have successively designed new types of machinery and equipment that our country has never made before, such as the YKC-31 drilling machine and the BΠΠ-3 vibratory pile driver. The workers of Feng Sen's work team came to the bridge construction site in July, and they were not familiar with the operation, taking more than seven hours to insert a pile. By September, they had set a record of driving 4.8 piles in eight hours and became skilled assembly and hoisting workers. The three-level workers on the bridge are now generally undertaking the work of four-level workers.

    There are only five large crane ships in the entire country, and various places have sent them three. The Ministry of Heavy Industry gave the bridge their urgently needed steel plate leveling machine and angle steel straightening machine. The First Ministry of Machine Building also sent the tower crane used for exhibitions to the bridge construction site.

    At this time, leading staff at all levels of the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, found the potential in the initiative of the broad masses of workers and Soviet experts, criticized conservative ideas, and formulated a plan to ensure that trains pass over the Yangtze River Bridge ahead of schedule.

    This plan was immediately enthusiastically supported by all the bridge workers. The youth concrete assault team of the First Bridge Team immediately requested to add 200 cubic meters of concrete to the task in December. Zhou Shutao, an outstanding youth hammer worker, challenged all the bridge workers with a guarantee of overfulfilling the December plan by 130%. The youth fitter assault team of the mechanical leasing station challenged all the youth assault teams (groups) on the bridge with six conditions, including overfulfilling the monthly plan by 110%. The Second Bridge Team on the right bank also challenged the First Bridge Team on the left bank, and a hot labor competition was launched throughout the bridge!

    One day in November, huge winds and waves arose on the Yangtze River. The ferry from Hankou Wuhan Customs to Wuchang was suspended, and many ships had also sailed to quiet places to avoid the wind and waves. At this time, the No. 5 cofferdam in the middle of the river had not yet sunk to the bottom of the river, and was being rocked up and down like a large cradle by waves several feet high, and the nurses on it were nauseous and vomiting. However, no one retreated, and welding work was still in full swing! The workers, sailors, and policemen who were on duty on the positioning ship the day before, could not be relieved because the ship could not get close to the positioning ship, and the people taking over could not get on, and they could not get off either, and the dry food they brought to the ship the day before was all eaten. However, they still communicated with the shore by radio: "It's okay, we are sticking to our work!"

    These people fought day and night on the river, and finally completed the sinking of the No. 5 cofferdam in a month or so. Immediately afterwards, they started the pipe pile sinking work. Zhang Dianxue's work team exceeded the quota by 13% on the first day, and Liu Jinxiang's work team exceeded the quota by 39% on the third day. They were so skilled in sinking the pipe piles that the expert team leader Sirin could not help but admire: "It's like actors performing!"

    December was the most intense month for the Yangtze River Bridge construction site. Production victories were constantly reported from various units!

    The workers of the Second Bridge Team poured 1,600 cubic meters of underwater concrete in four days and nights, completing the bottom sealing work of the No. 8 bridge pier seven and a half hours ahead of schedule.

    The mechanical repair and leasing station manufactured the first vibratory pile driver with greater vibration force, completing the eight-day plan for re-driving the pipe piles of the No. 1 bridge pier in two days.

    The structural design of the abutment body was also completed three days ahead of schedule.

    The workers of the Yangtze River Bridge are welcoming the fourth year of the first five-year plan with full confidence!

　　争取提前建成长江大桥
    周铭　万强
    最近，建设武汉长江大桥的职工们作出了一项决定：“保证火车提前通过长江大桥！”这就将使我国南北交通的主要干线——京汉铁路和粤汉铁路提前连结起来，对促进祖国的物资流通，对支援社会主义建设事业，发挥难以计算的作用。
    这个决定立即改变了长江工地的面貌。在冬季多浪的江上，有六个桥墩在同时施工。工人们还在赶制两个新的钢围囹，要在两个月内使大桥的八个桥墩全部动工。30公尺高的万能打桩机已经从左岸运到右岸的黄鹤楼前施展威力了，左岸龟山脚下又竖起了一座巨型的塔式吊机。两岸的工人们正在浇灌十多个引桥墩身的混凝土，铺筑铁路的路基和护坡。按照新的计划，他们1956年要在江上修起三个桥墩，架起一孔钢梁，并且把两岸的桥台、引桥和跨线桥等铁路桥面以下的工程全部完成。从1956年下半年起，他们还要陆续抽出三个桥梁队去担负新的建桥任务。
    苏联专家创造的“管柱钻孔法”，对提前建成长江大桥起了决定作用。运用这个在全世界还没人用过的“管柱钻孔法”，在正式开工以前，曾遇到许多困难。钻头不适合长江的地质条件，工人操作不熟练，第一部钻机试钻了三个月还没钻完两个孔，而全桥需要钻两百多个孔。一百多吨重的八号围囹需要重新吊起来加固，没有这么大能力的起重设备。据初步计算，将这样重的围囹在江上吊一个星期，也为安全规程所绝不容许。这时候，在困难面前出现了两种态度：一种是强调任务重、困难多、力量不足，对按期建成大桥缺乏信心；一种是主动克服困难，积极挖掘潜力，要争取提前建成大桥。
    事情的发展怎样呢？
    机械专家普罗赫洛夫上午回到武汉，下午就到工地去同职工们一道研究问题，采纳了工程师萧传仁的建议，修改了钻头的设计。专家柯斯金帮助工人改进了操作方法。结果由每20分钟就打坏一个钻头，提高到连续钻11根钻进35公尺还不坏一次。专家卡尔宾斯基和塔马诺夫设法用四部绞车和三艘大吊船来吊起八号围囹，同时实行“按工序分工”和“实物交底”的办法，将加固八号围囹的计划时间压缩为36小时。在围囹加固那天，两位专家在墩上坚持了一个昼夜，终于使八号围囹的加固和下沉工作在20多小时内提前完成。
    在苏联专家的具体帮助下，仅仅几个月的时间，长江大桥工地便有了显著变化。最初七天才能下沉一根管柱，现在一天可以下沉四根。一号桥墩钻岩初期，用了一个多月的时间，日夜三班只钻进了5.3公寸，现在平均每班八小时就能钻进八公寸多，最高达到1.8公尺。最初单独制造一个围囹需要两个多月，现在可以同时制造两个围囹，每个只需20天。挖土工人也由过去每工挖0.8方提高到2.5方，在武昌线路上的铁道兵还达到了每工五方。
    在汉水铁桥工程中还是技术员的萧传仁，现在独当一面地担负起左岸大桥桥墩基础施工的技术责任。在汉水铁桥还是起码级的工程师殷万寿，现在担任了右岸的代总工程师。机械修路经租站技术室里，除了两位壮年的工程师外，都是刚从学校出来的青年，平均年龄才23岁。但是，他们在专家指导下，先后设计出了YKC—31型钻机和BΠΠ—3型震动打桩机等我国从未作过的新式机具。冯森工班的工人7月里来到大桥工地，操作不熟，插一根桩花七小时多。到9月，他们就创造了八小时打完4.8根桩的纪录，成为熟练的装吊工。大桥的三级工人，现在都普遍地担当着四级工人的工作。
    全国总共只有五艘大吊船，各地就给他们送来了三艘。重工业部将他们正急用的钢板平整机和角钢矫正机让给了大桥。第一机械工业部也把展览用的塔式吊机送给了大桥工地。
    就在这时候，长江大桥工程局各级领导工作人员学习了毛主席的“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党的六中全会决议，从广大职工和苏联专家的主动精神中找到了潜力所在，批判了保守思想，订出了保证让火车提前通过长江大桥的计划。
    这个计划立即受到全桥职工的热烈拥护。第一桥梁队青年混凝土突击队立即要求12月份追加二百方混凝土的任务。青年优秀锤工周树桃以超额完成12月份计划130％的保证条件，向全桥工人挑战。机械经租站青年钳工突击班以每月超额完成计划110％等六项条件向全桥青年突击队（组）挑战。右岸第二桥梁队也向左岸第一桥梁队挑战，全桥展开了热火朝天的劳动竞赛！
    11月里的一天，长江上掀起了巨大的风浪。由汉口武汉关开往武昌的轮渡停航了，许多船只也事先开往僻静处躲避风浪去了。这时，位于江心的五号围囹还未下沉到江底，被几尺高的浪头摇晃得像只大摇篮似的上下颠簸，上面的护士都被摇得恶心呕吐。但是，谁也没有退缩，电焊工作依然在紧张进行！头天下午到定位船上值班的工人、水手、民警，因为轮船靠不拢定位船，接班的人上不去，他们也下不来，而头天带到船上的干粮都吃光了。但是，他们还用无线电同岸上通话：“不要紧，我们在坚持工作！”
    这些人就是这样日夜地战斗在江上，终于在一个来月中将五号围囹下沉完毕。他们紧接着又开始了管柱下沉工作，张殿学工班第一天就超过定额13％，刘进祥工班第三天又超过定额39％。他们下沉管柱是那么熟练，以致专家组长西林不禁赞赏道：“简直像演员们在表演！”
    12月是长江大桥工地最紧张的一月。各单位都不断传出生产捷报！
    第二桥梁队的职工们在四个昼夜里，浇灌了1，600方水下混凝土，提前七个半小时完成八号桥墩的封底工作。
    机械修配经租站制成了第一部震力较大的震动打桩机，使一号桥墩复打管柱的八天的计划，在两天内就全部完成了。
    桥台台身的结构设计也提前三天完成。
    长江大桥的职工们，满怀信心地迎接第一个五年计划的第四年！
