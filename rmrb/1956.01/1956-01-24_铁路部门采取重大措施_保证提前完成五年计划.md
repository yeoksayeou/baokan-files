Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: The railway department has recently adopted several major measures to ensure the early completion of the Five-Year Plan. To strengthen the design work of new railways, the five design sub-bureaus under the Design General Bureau of the Ministry of Railways have recently been converted into design institutes. The Ministry of Railways has transferred a batch of cadres to strengthen the leadership of each design institute; and more than 700 engineers with practical work experience and students from universities and colleges have been transferred to work in various design institutes. This year, the design department will also adopt methods such as aerial surveying of new routes, simplifying design procedures, and using a large number of standardized designs to speed up surveying and design, and improve the efficiency of design work.

The railways that the railway department plans to build this year are mostly in sparsely populated remote areas, mountainous areas, and desert areas, and the amount of construction is very large. Now, the relevant units have decided to adopt mechanized construction to reduce difficulties in manpower and the supply of necessities.

In terms of the transportation work of the existing railways, the Ministry of Railways has put forward 73 specific measures to improve operation and management, and requires all railway administrations to follow them. It is also summarizing the experience of the "full load, super-axle, 500-kilometer movement" carried out by railways across the country in recent years, and is preparing to further carry out this movement this year. In order to extensively mobilize the masses, promote and exchange advanced experience, the Ministry of Railways, the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways, and the National Committee of the China Railway Trade Union have jointly decided on January 10th to convene a large-scale national conference of activists of the railway industry on March 20th.

    铁路部门采取重大措施
    保证提前完成五年计划
    新华社23日讯　铁路部门最近采取了几项重大措施，保证提前完成五年计划。为了加强新铁路的设计工作，铁道部设计总局所属的五个设计分局，最近都改为设计院。铁道部抽调出一批干部，加强各设计院的领导；并且抽调了七百多个有实际工作经验的工程师和大学、专科学校的学生到各设计院工作。设计部门今年还要采用航空测量新路线、简化设计工作程序、大量使用定型设计等办法来加快勘测设计，提高设计工作的效率。
    铁路部门计划在今年内修建的铁路，多在人烟稀少的偏僻地区、山区和沙漠地带，而且工程数量很大。现在，有关的单位已经决定采用机械化施工，以减少人力和生活必需品供应方面的困难。
    在原有铁路的运输工作方面，铁道部提出了73项改进经营管理的具体措施，要各铁路管理局遵照执行。并且正在总结几年来全国铁路开展“满载、超轴、五百公里运动”的经验，准备今年更进一步开展这个运动。为了深入广泛地发动群众，提倡和交流先进经验，铁道部、铁道部政治部和中国铁路工会全国委员会已经在1月10日作出联合决定，将在3月20日召开一个大规模的全国铁路活动分子代表大会。
