    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS, London, January 6th: A Reuters commentator said: "British newspapers are increasingly expressing dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Eden's policies and decisions on domestic and international events." This comment shows that such widespread dissatisfaction has even forced conservative newspapers to criticize the current cabinet.
    The commentator said: "Most of the critics believe that Britain made a huge mistake in the Middle East and it is detached from reality." The commentator cited the political scandal surrounding Britain's secret supply of weapons to Middle Eastern countries, which aroused "a wave of dissatisfaction with the government's policies everywhere."
    The Reuters commentator continued: "People are also dissatisfied with the government's approach to solving domestic financial problems. Many are worried about rising prices and inflation."

    艾登政府政策引起国内不满
    新华社据塔斯社伦敦6日讯　路透社评论员说：“英国报纸对艾登首相的政策和在国内外事件上作出的决定越来越表示不满。”从这篇评论可以看出，这种普遍的不满甚至迫使保守报纸也不得不对现任内阁提出指责。
    评论员说：“大多数的指责者认为，英国在中东犯了极大的错误，它脱离了现实。”评论员举例说，围绕着英国秘密供应中东国家武器的政治丑闻而激起了“到处不满政府政策的浪潮”。
    路透社评论员接着说：“人们对政府解决国内财政问题的办法也表示不满。许多人都担心着物价上涨和通货膨胀。”
