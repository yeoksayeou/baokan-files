Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 18th: Amidst a chorus of condemnation from domestic and international public opinion, Dulles held a press conference on January 17th to issue another statement regarding his remarks on the "brink of war" policy.

Dulles admitted at the beginning of the statement that the "Life" magazine article "caused a lot of comments." Apparently trying to avoid the brunt of criticism, he said, "Let me be clear, I did not write this article, I did not review or check this article."

However, Dulles's difficulty lies in the fact that while he wants to avoid becoming the center of criticism, he is unwilling to abandon his policy of "deterrence" based on strength. Thus, Dulles's statement is full of self-contradictory remarks. Dulles said that "Life" magazine was "somewhat ambiguous in its wording" in one place when quoting him (referring to "staying on the brink of war"). But he immediately admitted that, on the whole, the meaning was "clear" and that his words "did not need correction from a substantial point of view."

In his statement, Dulles tried to prove that the atomic weapons intimidation policy is not his personal policy or the policy of the Republican Party alone, but a "national policy." Moreover, this policy is also reflected in the military treaties that the United States has "concluded with 42 countries," as if this policy is also a common policy of the United States and its allies, although the recent reactions of public opinion in various countries have refuted this assertion. Dulles admitted that this policy "of course contains (war) dangers," but he believes that the United States should take this "calculated risk."

After Dulles read the statement, reporters bombarded him with questions. When reporters asked about the three times he mentioned being on the "brink of war," he avoided answering directly. When a reporter asked Dulles to affirmatively answer whether his statement in the "Life" magazine interview that he "never doubted that the President would regard an attack on Quemoy and Matsu as an attack on Taiwan" was "correct," Dulles replied, "I have said before that I have not read this article beforehand, and I do not want to talk about the author's views here." However, Dulles did not forget to wield his weapon of "deterrence" based on strength on this issue. In his subsequent answers to questions, he actually repeated once again the crude intimidation against the Chinese people that he had issued in his interview with "Life" magazine.

Reuters reporter Rankin described Dulles's awkward situation at the press conference, saying that Dulles "did not answer most of the reporters' questions," and "Mr. Dulles cut off this part of the press conference at the end of the unusually frank questioning, cross-examination, and demands for the publication of 'facts' from the reporters for half an hour, insisting on turning to other topics." The reporter also said: "Dulles was unusually nervous during most of the repeatedly questioned time at the conference."

### 杜勒斯发表自相矛盾的声明

    杜勒斯发表自相矛盾的声明
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：在国内外舆论的一片责难声中，杜勒斯1月17日举行记者招待会，就他的关于“战争边缘”政策的谈话再次发表声明。
    杜勒斯在声明一开头承认：“生活”杂志的文章“引起了很多评论”。显然是为了回避各方抨击的锋芒，他说：“让我说清楚，我没有写这篇文章，我没有审查或检查这篇文章。”
    但是，杜勒斯的困难在于，他一方面要使自己不再成为抨击的中心，另一方面又丝毫不肯放弃他的实力“威慑”政策。这样，在杜勒斯的声明中就充满了自相矛盾的说法。杜勒斯说，“生活”杂志在引用他的话的时候有一处（意指“保持在战争边缘”）“用字多少有些含糊”。可是他紧接着又承认，整个说来，意思是“清楚”的，他的话“从实质的观点来看是不需要更正的”。
    杜勒斯在声明中力图证明，原子武器恫吓政策，不是他个人的或共和党一党的政策，而是“全国的政策”。而且这个政策还表现在美国“同42个国家缔结的”那些军事条约中，似乎这种政策也是美国和它的盟国的共同政策，虽然最近世界各国舆论的反映，已经驳倒了他的这种论断。杜勒斯承认这种政策“当然含有（战争）危险”，但是，他认为美国应当冒这种“意料中的危险”。
    在杜勒斯宣读声明之后，记者们纷纷对他提出问题。当记者问到有关他所说的三次走到“战争边缘”的问题时，他都避免正面答复，有记者要求杜勒斯肯定回答，在“生活”杂志发表的他的谈话中所说的他“从来不怀疑总统会把对金门和马祖的进攻看作是对台湾的进攻”的话是否“正确”，杜勒斯回答说：“我先前已经说过，我没有事先读过这篇文章，我不想在这里谈作者的看法。”但是，杜勒斯没有忘记在这个问题上挥舞他的实力“威慑”的武器。他在以后回答问题中，实际上又一次重复了他在对“生活”杂志谈话中所发出的对中国人民的粗暴的恫吓。
    路透社记者兰金描述杜勒斯在这次记者招待会上的尴尬处境说：杜勒斯对于“大部分记者的大部分问题都没有答复”，“杜勒斯先生在记者们半小时之久的异乎寻常地直率发问、盘诘和要求公布‘事实’的暴风雨结束时，切断了记者招待会的这一部分，坚持转谈别的题目。”这个记者又说：“杜勒斯在招待会的大部分反复追问的时间内态度异乎寻常的紧张”。
