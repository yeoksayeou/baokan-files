Shaoshan Township, Chairman Mao's Hometown—
Achieves Full Socialist Agricultural Cooperativization

　　Chairman Mao's hometown—Shaoshan Township in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, established the all-township Shaoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative on the 17th, achieving complete socialist agricultural cooperativization.

　　In the spring of 1954, Shaoshan Township established the semi-socialist Shaoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative. In the winter of that year, it established 12 elementary cooperatives including Shaoyang. Last year, all 13 cooperatives achieved large-scale bumper harvests. The Shaojing Agricultural Production Cooperative even produced "thousand-jin mu" yields. Encouraged by Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization," another elementary cooperative was established last winter, achieving semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. At the same time, farmers throughout the township actively requested that the elementary cooperatives be transformed into advanced cooperatives. On January 8th, gongs and drums resounded throughout the township, and men and women farmers, wearing new clothes, enthusiastically submitted applications to the township people's committee to join the advanced cooperatives. Some agricultural production cooperatives even sealed the members' applications with large red paper, writing on it: "Listen to Chairman Mao's words, take the road of cooperativization."

　　During the preparation for the advanced cooperatives and after their establishment, the enthusiasm of the farmers throughout the township for production was very high. During the transition period, the farmers built a small reservoir, which will enable the area planted with double-cropping rice this year to be expanded to more than 300 mu. Now, the farmers are carrying out a "thousand carts, ten thousand dan" manure accumulation campaign and are actively greening the entire township. (Luo Yueqiu)

    毛主席故乡——韶山乡
    实现全社会主义农业合作化
    毛主席故乡——湖南省湘潭县韶山乡在17日建成了全乡性的韶山农业生产合作社，实现了完全社会主义的农业合作化。
    1954年春天，韶山乡建立了半社会主义性质的韶山农业生产合作社；这年冬天，又建立了韶阳等12个初级社。去年13个社都获得了大面积丰产。韶景农业生产合作社还出现了“千斤亩”。在毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告的鼓舞下，去年冬季又建立了一个初级社，实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。同时，全乡农民积极要求把初级社转为高级社。1月8日，全乡四面八方锣鼓喧天，男女农民穿起新衣，纷纷把参加高级社的申请书送到乡人民委员会。有的农业生产合作社还把社员们的申请书用大红纸封好，上面写着：“听毛主席的话，走合作化的道路”。
    在筹办高级社期间和成立高级社以后，全乡农民生产热情十分高涨。转社期间，农民们就修成了一个小型水库，可以使今年双季稻的种植面积扩大到300多亩。现在，农民们正在开展“千车万担”的积肥运动，并且在积极绿化全乡。　　　（罗月秋）
