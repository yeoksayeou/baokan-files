    Oppose US Hydrogen Bomb Tests in the Pacific Region
    More than 3.3 Million Signatures in Japan
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 25th: The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs submitted a petition to the Diet on January 24th, hoping that the Japanese Diet would request the US government to stop the hydrogen bomb tests scheduled to take place this spring on Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific.
    The petition pointed out that the United States, in violation of Japanese public opinion, is preparing to conduct hydrogen bomb tests again in the Pacific region. The Japanese people feel deeply uneasy about this matter and believe that such tests violate international law.
    The petition stated that the signature campaign to ban atomic weapons, which is being promoted throughout the country, had reached 33.1 million signatures by the end of last year. The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, on behalf of more than 33 million signatories, requested that appropriate measures be taken to stop atomic weapons tests on the high seas.
    "Keep Hydrogen Bombs Away from Australia"
    Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, January 24th: The Australian "Guardian" published an editorial on January 19th, calling for "keeping hydrogen bombs away from Australia."
    The editorial pointed out that because the United States and Britain are about to conduct two atomic or hydrogen bomb explosion tests near Australia, Australians risk suffering the same fate as the Japanese fishermen who were killed or seriously injured by the deadly particles of the last American hydrogen bomb. The editorial said that the Japanese fishermen were said to be in a "safe zone" at the time. However, who can say where the "safe zone" will be when the test is conducted in April? The editorial said: "No wonder 'Keep hydrogen bombs away from Australia' is becoming a national slogan."
    The editorial said, "Will the will of the majority of the world's people prevail, or the will of a handful of American monopoly capitalists, generals, and politicians? Australians will play their part in making the most important decision humanity has ever faced."

    反对美国在太平洋地区试验氢弹
    日本3，300多万人签名
    据新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会在1月24日向国会提出请愿书，希望日本国会要求美国政府停止预订今年春天在太平洋恩纳威托克岛举行的氢弹试验。
    请愿书指出，美国违反日本舆论，再次准备在太平洋地区举行氢弹试验，日本人民对这件事感到深刻的不安，并且认为这种试验是违反国际法的。
    请愿书说，在全国各地推进的要求禁止原子武器的签名运动，到去年年底为止，签名人数已经有3，310万人。日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会以3，300多万个签名者的名义，要求采取适当措施，停止在公海进行原子武器试验。
    “使氢弹远离澳大利亚”
    据新华社24日讯　墨尔本消息：澳大利亚“卫报”1月19日发表社论，要求“使氢弹远离澳大利亚”。
    社论指出，由于美国和英国行将在澳大利亚附近举行两次原子弹或氢弹爆炸试验，澳大利亚人将有遭到同那些被上一次美国氢弹的致命的微粒所杀害或者严重损伤的日本渔民一样的命运的危险。社论说，据说日本渔民当时是在一个“安全地带”里。但是，谁能够说在4月间举行试验时，“安全地带”将在什么地方呢？社论说：“无怪乎‘使氢弹远离澳大利亚’正在成为全国各地的口号。”
    社论说，“将要取得胜利的是世界上大多数人的意志呢，还是一小撮美国垄断资本家、将军和政客的意志呢？澳大利亚人将在作出人类所曾面临过的最紧要的决定中起他们的作用。”
