Xinhua News Agency Report:

　　Soviet “North Pole-5” and “North Pole-4” floating ice scientific research stations are accelerating their research work in the frigid and lengthy "Polar Night."

　　Where the "North Pole-5" research station is drifting, the "Polar Night" has already lasted for three months. The sun has not appeared again; only the aurora borealis occasionally illuminates the icebergs around the tents. Despite the severe cold of the Arctic winter, scientific work has greatly expanded. Life here follows a strict routine. Radio operators maintain regular contact with Soviet radio enthusiasts and have established contact with the "Glory" whaling fleet, which is on the other side of the Earth.

　　In the course of its meandering drift, the "North Pole-4" scientific station has recently passed 85 degrees north latitude three times. Since the beginning of December last year, the moon has shone on the icy and snowy world around the tents day and night. The air temperature here has suddenly dropped to minus 40 degrees Celsius. To keep warm, the researchers used snow bricks to surround the cabins and dining hall. The scientific station's nine-month scientific work plan has been fully completed.

### “北极夜”里的苏联浮冰科学研究站

　　“北极夜”里的苏联浮冰科学研究站
    在严寒而漫长的“北极夜”里，苏联“北极五号”和“北极四号”浮冰科学研究站的研究工作仍然在加速进行。
    在“北极五号”研究站飘流的地方，“北极夜”已经延续了三个月。太阳再也没有露过面，只是偶尔有北极光照亮帐篷周围的冰山。尽管北极的冬天这样严寒，但是科学工作反而大大地扩展了。这里的生活按照严格的制度进行着。无线电报务员同苏联无线电爱好者保持着经常的联系，并且同正在地球的另一端的“光荣”捕鲸船队取得了联系。
    “北极四号”科学站在它曲线飘流的过程中，最近已经三次经过北纬85度。月亮从去年12月初起就整昼夜地普照着帐篷周围的冰雪世界。这里空气的温度一下子降到了零下40度。为了保暖，考察人员们用雪砖把小屋和食堂围起来。科学站的九个月的科学工作计划已经全部完成了。
