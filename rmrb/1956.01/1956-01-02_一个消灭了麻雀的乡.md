　　A Township That Eliminated Sparrows
    He Dian
    Recently, a township where sparrows are nowhere to be seen has emerged in the suburbs of Beijing. This is the Huoqi Ying Township, which is located right next to the Summer Palace. On December 20th, I visited this township. Liu Shutian, the township's cultural and educational committee member (and one of the people in charge of the sparrow elimination work), introduced me to the process by which they eliminated sparrows. He said, "After we heard Chairman Mao's call to eliminate the four pests, we decided, based on the specific situation in our township, to first eliminate sparrows, rats, and crows, the three kinds of harmful birds and beasts. Under the unified leadership of the township's CCP branch, we organized five capture teams by village and carried out the capture work separately." He took out his notebook and looked at it, saying, "From November 29th to December 6th, these eight days, we captured a total of 2,119 sparrows. After the 6th, we continued to capture and kill them, but because the sparrows had been basically eliminated, the whole township only captured more than two hundred in ten days or so, and two villages didn't even capture a single one." He pointed to the pine trees outside the township People's Committee office and said, "Before we eliminated the sparrows, flocks of sparrows would chirp and chatter here every morning and evening. As soon as they found something to eat, they would fly away like a gust of wind, and then fly back again in a gust. Now, look! Not a single one."
    Young people are most enthusiastic about the work of capturing sparrows. The 17 capture team members in Huoqi Ying Township are all young students and militiamen. Liu Shutian took me to visit Fu Shushen, an activist in sparrow catching. He is a student who actively participates in sparrow catching after school every night. They have four or five methods for catching sparrows, including glue traps, net pulling, clip trapping, horsehair nooses, and hand catching. They believe that sparrows now live under the eaves of houses, and when you shine a flashlight on them at night, the sparrows' eyes get dazzled, and you can catch two at a time. So now the best way to catch sparrows is by hand. After the spring, sparrows begin to lay eggs and hatch chicks, often staying in their nests, which is the best time to use horsehair nooses. Fu Shushen caught 36 in one night by hand.
    Huoqi Ying is not a very large township, with just over 600 households in five natural villages. We walked through several villages and really didn't see a single sparrow. Liu Shutian said modestly, "Although we can't see any sparrows in our township now, there may still be a few that have slipped through the net and are hiding, and others may fly in from other townships. We can't be complacent. Our capture team hasn't been disbanded. Now we are continuing to catch sparrows while catching them as they appear; at the same time, we have begun to capture rats and crows to completely eliminate harmful beasts and birds."

### 一个消灭了麻雀的乡

　　一个消灭了麻雀的乡
    贺甸
    北京市郊最近出现了一个看不到麻雀的乡，这就是紧靠着颐和园的火器营乡。12月20日，我访问了这个乡。乡的文教委员刘书田（也是消灭麻雀工作负责人之一），向我介绍了他们消灭麻雀的经过。他说：“我们听到毛主席号召消灭四害以后，便根据乡里的具体情况，决定首先消灭麻雀、老鼠和乌鸦三种害鸟害兽。在乡的中共支部统一领导下，我们按村组织了五个捕捉队，分头进行捕捉工作。”他掏出笔记本看了看说：“从11月29日到12月6日这八天中，我们共捕捉麻雀2，119只，6日以后还是继续捕打，但是因为麻雀已经基本上被消灭掉了，十几天中全乡才捕了二百多只，有两个村连一只也没捕到。”他指着乡人民委员会办公室外的松树说：“没有打麻雀以前，每天早晚都有成群结队的麻雀在这里叽叽喳喳地叫个不停，一发现哪儿有吃的东西，便一阵风似的呼啦飞去，一会儿又呼啦飞来，现在，你看！一只也没有了。”
    青年人对捕捉麻雀这一工作最为热情，火器营乡的17个捕捉队员都是年轻的学生和民兵。刘书田带我访问了一个捕雀积极分子傅书申，他是一个学生，每晚放学后都积极参加捕雀。他们捕雀的方法有胶粘、网拉、夹子扑、马尾套和手抓等四、五种，他们认为现在麻雀都住在屋椽下，天黑的时候用手电筒一照，雀儿眼就花了，一抓就是两个，所以现在捕雀最好的办法是手抓。春季以后，麻雀开始生蛋孵小雀，经常在窝里，那时最适合用马尾套。傅书申就是用抓的办法，曾经在一个晚上抓了36只。
    火器营是一个不很大的乡，全乡五个自然村共六百多户人家。我们在几个村中走了一遍，真的没有看到一只麻雀。刘书田谦逊地说：“现在我们乡里虽然是看不到麻雀了，但是也可能还有几个漏网的躲起来了，别乡的也还会飞来，我们不能自满，我们捕捉队也没解散，现在一面继续捕雀，随有随捕；一面又开始捕捉老鼠、乌鸦，彻底消灭害兽害鸟。”
