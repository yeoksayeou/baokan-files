Xinhua News Agency, January 28th: The Ministry of Electric Power Industry and the Ministry of Water Conservancy have decided to conduct a large-scale survey of water conservancy and hydroelectric resources nationwide. This decision was announced at the National Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Resources Survey Conference, which closed today.

This year, the two ministries will dispatch more than 30 survey teams to work in seven regions, including the Southwest, Central South, and Xinjiang, to ascertain the water conservancy and hydroelectric resources of some main streams and tributaries of 25 river systems. It is planned that by the end of 1957, the resource situation of more than 50 major rivers across the country, from Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula in the south to the Nenjiang and Songhua Rivers in the north, will be basically clarified. Furthermore, preparations are being made to gradually formulate river basin plans based on the principle of comprehensive river utilization.

To ensure the success of this survey, both ministries have made extensive preparations beforehand. The survey and design departments of the General Bureau of Hydropower Construction of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry spent more than half a year last year collecting relevant data on more than 1,500 larger rivers, accounting for 70% of the country's basin area. They also made new estimates of the hydroelectric resources contained in the country's major rivers and formulated preliminary plans and survey regulations (draft) for this nationwide survey. At the joint conference held by the two ministries, the division of labor, cooperation, and unified regulations were specifically discussed.

    全国将大规模普查水利水力资源
    据新华社28日讯　电力工业部和水利部决定在全国范围内进行一次大规模的水利、水力资源普查工作。这个决定是在今天闭幕的全国水利、水力资源普查会议上宣布的。
    今年，这两个部将派出30多个普查队，分别在西南、中南、新疆等7个地区进行工作，查明25个水系的部分干流和支流的水利、水力资源情况；计划到1957年底，南自海南岛、雷州半岛，北到嫩江、松花江的全国50多条主要河流的资源情况，都将基本上调查清楚。并且准备在这个基础上，按照河流综合利用的原则逐步作出各河流的流域规划。
    这两个部为了认真做好这次普查工作，事先都做了很多准备。电力工业部水力发电建设总局的勘测设计部门去年曾花了大半年时间，收集了占全国流域面积70％的1，500多条较大河流的有关资料，并且作出了全国各大河流所蕴藏的水力资源的新估算，拟定出了这次全国规模的普查初步计划和普查规程（草案）。在这次两个部联合召开的会议上，又具体讨论了分工合作和统一规程等问题。
