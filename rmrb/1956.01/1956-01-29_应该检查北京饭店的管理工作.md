    The Management Work of the Beijing Hotel Should Be Inspected
    To the Editor:
    I believe that the management work of the Beijing Hotel should be seriously inspected and improved. My unit recently hosted foreign guests who stayed on the third floor of the new building of the Beijing Hotel. The south-facing rooms were too hot due to excessive heating, which could not be adjusted, and we were sweating even when wearing very little clothing. The north-facing rooms, however, were very cold and drafty. On January 5th, the temperature in Beijing dropped sharply, and the weather was severely cold. On the 7th, the already weak heating was cut off. The hotel did not notify us in advance, nor did it provide any temporary heating measures. As a result, the north-facing rooms were almost as cold as the courtyard, and the guests wore leather coats indoors; even the corridor was warmer than the rooms. We negotiated with the hotel and moved the rooms to the south side. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of January 20th, the heating pipes in the south-facing rooms were ice-cold again. After discovering this, we negotiated with the hotel and repeatedly inquired. Around 3 p.m., there was some heat, but by 5 p.m., it was gone again, and the heating pipes were as cold as ice. The guests said they had to do calisthenics in the rooms to keep warm. From the above situation, it seems that this hotel does not consistently consider the needs of its guests; it has not even fully achieved what a hotel should do—in severe winter, if the rooms are not warm, the guests should be notified in advance, and remedial measures should be devised. Now, problems occur continuously, and it takes several serious negotiations to resolve them, while the adverse impact is irreparable. We believe that the personnel managing the Beijing Hotel should strive to improve their work standards and earnestly manage the hotel well.

    应该检查北京饭店的管理工作编辑同志：
    我认为北京饭店的管理工作应认真检查和改善。我所在的单位最近招待外宾住在北京饭店新三楼，靠南面房间的暖汽太热，不能调节，在房内穿很少的衣服还出汗；靠北的房间却很冷，并且透风。1月5日北京气温骤降，天气严寒，7日，本来就微弱的暖汽又断了，但饭店事先既不通知我们，也没有任何临时取暖办法，结果靠北面房间里冷得差不多和院子里一样，客人在房内穿着皮大衣，连走廊都比房间里暖。我们和饭店交涉，把房间换到靠南的一面。不料1月20日下午靠南的房间里暖汽管又冰冷了。我们发现以后向饭店交涉并接连追查，下午3时许有了热汽，但到5时又没有了，暖汽管又像冰一样冷，客人说要在房间里作柔软体操取暖。从上述情况看来，这个旅馆并不是经常替旅客打算的，甚至并没有完全做到一个旅馆应当做到的事——严冬季节房间不暖就应当事先通知旅客，并想出补救办法。现在是连续发生了问题还要经过几度严重交涉才能解决，而所造成的不良的影响已是无法弥补了。我们认为管理北京饭店的人员应当努力提高工作水平，认真把饭店办好。
