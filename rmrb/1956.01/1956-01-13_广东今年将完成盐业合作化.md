Guangdong Province will basically complete the cooperativization of the private salt fields this year. This was proposed in the salt industry cooperativization plan recently formulated by the Liangguang Salt Affairs Bureau. It is estimated that by the end of this year, there will be 409 salt industry production cooperatives (including salt agricultural production cooperatives) in the province, including 38 advanced cooperatives. The number of salt farmers joining the cooperatives will account for more than 80% of the total number of salt farming households. (Xinhua News Agency)
