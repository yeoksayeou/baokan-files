    Anshan Iron and Steel Works Iron Smelting Plant Sets Specific Conditions
　　Guaranteeing Early Completion of the Five-Year Plan
    The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Iron Smelting Plant have set specific conditions to guarantee the early completion of the Five-Year Plan. The workers guarantee to complete the state plan this year according to the ordered varieties, the quality of pig iron will reach a first-class rate of 92%, and unqualified iron will be reduced to 0.3%. The effective volume of the blast furnace occupied per ton of iron smelted will be reduced to 0.76 cubic meters, and it is guaranteed that the coke required for smelting one ton of steelmaking iron will be reduced to 0.79 tons; the coke for smelting one ton of foundry iron will be reduced to 0.835 tons. The workers also proposed to increase the operating rate to 99.25%, ensuring the elimination of major personal injury accidents and equipment accidents throughout the year.
    The specific conditions put forward by the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Iron Smelting Plant are much higher than the national plan last year. Among them, the output has increased by more than 40%; the coke used per ton of iron smelted has been reduced by 80 kilograms, and the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace has been reduced from 0.845 cubic meters last year to 0.76 cubic meters.

    鞍钢炼铁厂订出具体条件
　　保证提前完成五年计划
    鞍钢炼铁厂的职工订出了保证提前完成五年计划的具体条件。职工们保证今年按照定货品种完成国家计划，生铁的质量一级品率达到92％，不合格的铁降低到0.3％。每炼一吨铁所占用的高炉有效容积降低到0.76立方公尺，并且保证每炼一吨炼钢铁所需要的焦炭减少到0.79吨；炼一吨铸造铁的焦炭减少到0.835吨。职工们还提出把作业率提高到99.25％，保证全年内消灭重大人身事故和设备事故。
    鞍钢炼铁厂职工提出的这些具体条件，比去年国家计划提高了很多。其中，产量提高了百分之四十多；每炼一吨铁所用的焦炭减少了80公斤，高炉的利用系数由去年的0.845立方公尺降低到0.76立方公尺。
