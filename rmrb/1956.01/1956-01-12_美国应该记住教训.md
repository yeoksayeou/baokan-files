    The United States Should Remember the Lesson
    On the very day that the Chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, arrived in South Korea from Taiwan, two U.S. military aircraft intruded into our Northeast airspace. On the very same day, the United States announced that it had signed a so-called "Reserve and Replenishment System Plan" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique regarding the Chiang bandit army. According to this plan, the United States openly stated that it would establish nine reserve divisions for the Chiang bandit army. These are intolerable and serious provocative actions. These provocative actions are closely related to the recent frequent planning activities of Radford and other senior U.S. military leaders in Taiwan and the Far East.
    As can be seen from existing news, the activities of Radford and other U.S. military leaders in the Far East are aimed at carrying out military deployments centered on the Taiwan region and stepping up war preparations. This deployment includes strengthening the military strength of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the U.S. naval and air strength in the Taiwan region; strengthening a series of U.S. naval and air bases in the Far East from Japan to the Philippines, as well as the mutual coordination and support between these bases and Taiwan; and urging Asian countries participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to step up military expansion and war preparation. While carrying out these activities, they also repeat some worthless and rogue-like howls and threats almost every day. The purpose of the United States in doing this is very obvious. It wants to strengthen military threats in the Taiwan region to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands; at the same time, it also wants to intensify the tense situation in the entire Far East, attempting to counter the efforts of the Asian people to oppose colonialism and ease the tense situation.
    The provocative actions of U.S. military aircraft infringing on Chinese airspace and the U.S. openly wanting to establish reserve divisions for the Chiang bandit army are obviously part of this conspiracy to intensify the tense situation.
    Encouraged by these actions of the United States, the Chiang bandit army is stepping up harassment activities in our coastal areas. Liang Xuzhao, the "Commander-in-Chief of the Navy" of the Chiang bandits, brazenly clamored on January 9 that he would use the four destroyers that the United States will hand over to the Chiang bandits to step up piracy activities in the coastal areas and intercept "all foreign ships" heading to China. The safety of the high seas in the Western Pacific has been further jeopardized by the activities of the United States.
    These aggressive activities of the United States are intolerable to the Chinese people and also intolerable to the people of the entire Far East and Asia. Perhaps the U.S. aggressor group has forgotten the many lessons it has received and still vainly hopes to use these aggressive activities to intimidate the Chinese people. But this forgetfulness will not bring any benefit to the U.S. aggressor group. This can be completely affirmed. For its own sake, the U.S. aggressor group had better remember the heavy lessons it has received.

    美国应该记住教训
    就在美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福从台湾到达南朝鲜活动的这一天，两架美国军用飞机侵入了我国东北领空。也就在这一天，美国方面宣布，它已经同蒋介石集团签订了一项关于蒋贼军的所谓“后备及补充制度的方案”。根据这个方案，美国公然表示它要为蒋贼军建立九个预备师。这些都是不能容忍的严重挑衅行动。这些挑衅行动同雷德福和其他美国高级军事首脑最近在台湾和远东地区进行的频繁的策划活动之间，有着密切的关联。
    从已有的消息可以看出，雷德福等美国军事首脑在远东地区的活动，是为了进行以台湾地区为中心的军事部署，加紧战争准备。这种部署包括加强蒋介石集团的军事力量和美国在台湾地区的海空实力；加强美国在远东的从日本一直到菲律宾的一系列海空基地，以及这些基地和台湾之间的相互策应和支援；督促参加东南亚条约集团的亚洲国家加紧扩军备战。在进行这些活动的同时，他们还几乎天天重复一些不值一文的、恶棍式的叫嚣和恫吓。美国这样做的目的是很明显的。它要在台湾地区加强军事威胁，阻挠中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿；同时它还要在整个远东地区加剧紧张局势，企图反击亚洲人民为反对殖民主义、为和缓紧张局势而作的努力。
    美国军用飞机侵犯中国领空和美国公然要为蒋贼军建立预备师的挑衅行动，显然就是这个加剧紧张局势的阴谋的一部分。
    由于美国这些行为的鼓励，蒋贼军正在我国沿海地区加紧骚扰活动。蒋贼“海军总司令”梁序昭1月9日就在放肆地叫嚣，要用美国将交给蒋贼的四只驱逐舰来加紧在沿海地区进行海盗活动，拦截开到中国来的“一切外国船只”。西太平洋公海的安全已经由于美国的活动而受到了更大的危害。
    美国的这一套侵略活动是中国人民所不能容忍的，也是整个远东和亚洲的人民所不能容忍的。也许美国侵略集团忘记了它受到的多次教训，还是妄想用这些侵略活动来吓倒中国人民。但是这种健忘对美国侵略集团决不会带来丝毫好处。这是完全可以肯定的。为它自己设想，美国侵略集团最好是记住它受过的沉重的教训。
