Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 22nd (TASS): N.S. Khrushchev delivered a speech on January 21st at the meeting of outstanding Komsomol members and young people who reclaimed wasteland in Moscow.

    Khrushchev first conveyed the congratulations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the attendees. He then said that the task of reclaiming wasteland put forward by the Party and the government can be said to have been basically completed. The land reclaimed was not the 13 million hectares we spoke of when we called for it, but much more than that. Now, 30 million hectares of land have been reclaimed in the reclamation areas, and a total of 33 million hectares of land have been reclaimed nationwide. If we adopted the usual method of immigrant reclamation, it would not be enough to reclaim so much land in two five-year plans. However, when we supplied machines to the reclamation areas and issued a call to young people and Komsomol members, this task was completed in a short period of time without any particular difficulty. I think that your selfless labor in this noble cause will remain in the memory of our people. Those young people and Komsomol members who went to reclaim wasteland will long be proud of the glorious cause they have accomplished in reclaiming wasteland. Now, we must not reduce our attention to reclaiming wasteland. We must continue this work in order to better reclaim the land and grow good grain on these lands. People must settle there, settle them down, and for this purpose, it is necessary to create good living conditions. Good houses must be built. New immigrants should start families, have children, and raise them there.

    Khrushchev then spoke about the draft directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union from 1956 to 1960. He said that all honest people are happy about this directive, and they regard it as a broad road for our Party and all the people to move towards the established goal of building a communist society. This is very gratifying, especially for those of us, the older generation, who have actively prepared and implemented the first five-year plan. We know that at that time, bourgeois economists, journalists, and others ridiculed the five-year plan, thinking it was a fantasy and saying that it would not produce any results. Now, after the publication of the draft directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, no madman can be found who would comfort himself with the idea that our plan is not feasible. On the contrary, the bourgeois world is making anxious noises, saying that the economy of the Soviet state is developing unprecedentedly. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union will also be able to successfully complete this five-year plan. The capitalists once thought that our people were backward. However, now we have more engineers and technical intellectuals than any capitalist country. And during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, their number will be even greater. This is what the imperialists are afraid of, that we will train our own cadres. Our cadres are very good, of course, we cannot be complacent. Even good cadres should be criticized in order to make them better. There is no contradiction between these two aspects.

    Khrushchev then spoke about the future work in the reclamation areas and the issue of streamlining the staffing of agricultural production units. He also talked about improving labor organization, promoting advanced working methods, improving the leadership of agriculture, and the trade work in the reclamation areas. He pointed out that although there is a lot of virgin land in Eastern Siberia and the Far East, and it is very fertile, it is not necessary to further develop the reclamation of wasteland there now. Instead, the technical equipment of the existing residential areas should be replaced in order to increase the yield per unit area of land. At present, some state farms have a large number of redundant staff. There are too many administrative and non-production personnel. It is necessary to reconsider the staffing and reduce redundant personnel. It is necessary to improve trade work so that all regions have the necessary commodities, sports equipment, and household goods on a regular basis. He especially called on the Komsomol members to fight against bureaucracy and called on young reclaimers to carry out spring sowing work quickly and without delay, and to do all the work both quickly and well in order to ensure a good harvest.

    Khrushchev emphasized that the draft directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Sixth Five-Year Plan set out grand plans in agriculture. Perhaps some people will be afraid. They will say that this cannot be completed, because there has never been such a large development in the past five-year plans. As long as we think of more ways to take on this task, I believe that the plan on yield per unit area and on increasing the production of agricultural and livestock products may not only be completed, but also greatly overfulfilled. At present, the whole problem lies in improving our leadership methods. We should carry out concrete work, not just issue calls. Whether it is in the collective farm or in the district, it has not yet been possible to make all the work teams or all the collective farms work like the advanced work teams and advanced collective farms.

    Khrushchev concluded by saying that the draft directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan are inspiring our people to carry out great and constructive work, and are making our enemies tremble. We are all living and working for the interests and happiness of our people. Young people are our future! They are doing such earth-shattering things side by side with their fathers. This is the most reliable guarantee for us to build communism.

### 赫鲁晓夫在会上的讲话

    赫鲁晓夫在会上的讲话
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫1月21日在莫斯科举行的苏联优秀的垦荒共青团员和青年会议上发表了讲话。
    赫鲁晓夫首先代表苏联共产党中央委员会向到会者表示祝贺。他接着说，党和政府提出的开垦荒地的任务，可以说基本上是完成了。开垦出来的土地不是我们在号召的时候所说的1，300万公顷，而是比它多得多。现在，在垦荒地区已经开垦了3，000万公顷土地，而在全国共开垦了3，300万公顷土地。如果我们采用通常的移民开荒的办法，那么，要开垦这么多的土地，两个五年计划的时间也不够。而当我们向开垦地区供应了机器，向青年和共青团员们发出号召的时候，这个任务就没有什么特别困难地在短时期内完成了。我想，你们在这个崇高事业中所作的忘我劳动，将留在我们人民的记忆中，前往开垦荒地的那些青年和共青团员，将长久地为他们在开垦荒地中所完成的光荣事业而自豪。现在，我们对开垦荒地绝不能减少注意，必须继续进行这种工作，以便更好地开垦土地和在这些土地上种出好的谷物来。必须使人们在那里定居下来，安顿他们，为了这个目的就需要创造良好的生活条件。必须建筑好房子。新的移民要在那里成家立业、生男育女。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于1956—1960年苏联发展国民经济第六个五年计划的指示草案。他说，一切正直的人都为这个指示而高兴，他们把这一指示看成是我们党和全体人民走向既定目标——建设共产主义社会——的康庄大道。这是十分令人高兴的，特别使我们这些曾经积极地准备和实行第一个五年计划的老一辈的人感到高兴。我们晓得，当时资产阶级的经济学家、记者和其他一些人曾经嘲笑过五年计划，认为它是幻想，说这不会产生什么结果。现在，在第六个五年计划的指示草案公布之后，已经再也找不出一个狂人，他会以我们的计划是不能实现的这种想法自慰。相反的是，资产阶级的世界发出惶惶不安的叫嚷，说苏维埃国家的经济在空前地发展着。毫无疑问，苏联也一定能胜利完成这一个五年计划。资本家曾经认为我国人民是落后的。但是，现在我们的工程师、技术知识分子要比任何一个资本主义国家多。而在第六个五年计划期间，他们的数目还要更多。帝国主义者就是害怕这一点，就是害怕我们培养出自己的干部。我们的干部是很好的，当然，不能自满。即使是对好的干部也应该批评，以便使他们更好。这两方面是没有任何矛盾的。
    赫鲁晓夫随后谈到了今后开垦地区的工作和精简农业生产单位的人员编制的问题，还谈到了改进劳动组织、推广先进工作方法、改进对农业的领导和开垦地区的贸易工作问题。他指出，虽然东西伯利亚和远东地区的生荒地很多而且很肥沃，但是，现在还不必在那里进一步开展开垦荒地的工作，而应该把现有的居民区的技术设备更换一下，以便提高土地的单位面积产量。目前若干国营农场有着许多人浮于事的现象，行政管理人员和非生产人员过多，必须重新考虑编制，裁减冗员。必须改进贸易工作，让所有地区经常有不可缺少的商品、运动器材、家常用品。他特别号召共青团员同官僚主义作斗争，并且号召青年垦荒者迅速地、毫不拖延地进行春播工作，把一切工作都做得既快又好，以便保证丰收。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示草案在农业方面订下了宏大的计划。也许有些人会打战。他们会说，这完成不了，因为历来的五年计划就没有过这样大的发展。只要多想办法把这件事担当起来，我相信，关于单位面积产量、关于增加农畜产品生产的计划，可能不只是会完成，而且会大大地超额完成。目前，全部问题在于改进我们的领导方法。应该进行具体工作，而不是仅仅发出号召。不论是在集体农庄里或者是在区里，却还没有做到使所有工作队或者所有集体农庄都像先进的工作队和先进集体农庄那样地工作。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，第六个五年计划的指示草案正在鼓舞着我国人民去进行伟大的、建设性的工作，并且使我们的敌人发抖。我们大家是在为我国人民的利益和幸福而生活和劳动着。青年是我们的未来！他们同自己的父亲一道并肩做着这样惊天动地的事情。这就是我们建成共产主义最可靠的保证。
