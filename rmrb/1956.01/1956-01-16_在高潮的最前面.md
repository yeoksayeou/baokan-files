    At the Forefront of the High Tide
    Yesterday, more than 200,000 people from all walks of life in Beijing held a celebration rally in Tiananmen Square to celebrate the victory of socialist transformation. In the high tide of socialist transformation across the country, the farmers of the glorious capital suburbs, the handicraftsmen and industrialists and businessmen of the capital, under the leadership of the working class, played an active leading role and walked at the forefront of the high tide. We warmly congratulate them.
    The fact that Beijing's socialist transformation work can advance at such an unprecedented speed, on such a grand scale, and with such healthy steps, shows that our Party and government's policies of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce are not only fully in line with China's specific conditions and the universal demands of the vast number of farmers, handicraftsmen, and private industrialists and businessmen, but also, after several years of implementation, have laid a solid foundation in all aspects, and now it has reached the time of "ripe conditions and natural success." In agriculture, the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing had all joined primary agricultural production cooperatives last year, livestock and farm tools have been collectivized, the production of old cooperatives has developed, the income of members has increased, the proportion of land dividends has gradually decreased, and the socialist consciousness of farmers has increased day by day. Everyone realizes that the primary cooperatives have restricted the continued development of productive forces and must move forward. The superiority of the 77 advanced cooperatives established in the suburbs in the past 4 years has also become a huge force guiding farmers to advance to advanced cooperatives. Under such circumstances, the transition from primary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives has become a natural trend. In terms of handicrafts, by the end of 1955, more than 36% of handicraftsmen in Beijing had organized more than 400 cooperatives, plus those participating in primary mutual aid and cooperation organizations accounted for more than 47%. All districts have established handicraft labor associations, which have not only gained experience in running cooperatives, but also cultivated a large number of activists. After short-term training, they became the backbone of cooperative building. Especially last year, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China strengthened its leadership over the cooperation of handicrafts. After all districts concentrated their efforts to systematically rectify the organization of handicraft production, the ideological awareness and production enthusiasm of the vast number of members of the cooperatives (groups) and individual handicraft laborers were greatly improved. Many handicraft production cooperatives have shown the superiority of being organized. This has laid a favorable foundation for the implementation of socialist cooperation in the city's handicrafts this year. In terms of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the vast majority of capitalist industry and commerce in Beijing are small and medium-sized factories and shops. In the past few years, capitalist industry and commerce have basically adopted various forms of state capitalism. The political awareness of capitalists has also been continuously improved. They realize that only by actively accepting socialist transformation can they have a bright future. Especially after the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions to the industrial and commercial circles and the Second Session of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce was conveyed, the industrial and commercial circles further realized that their future must be combined with the future of the country in order to control their own destiny. Therefore, they are determined to take the socialist road and have applied for joint state-private ownership one after another. This has created favorable conditions for the city to implement joint state-private ownership in all industries.
    Beijing's experience has a demonstrative effect on the socialist transformation work of other major cities across the country. All parts of the country should also base socialist planning on the most active and reliable basis according to specific circumstances, thoroughly overcome conservative tendencies, and fully utilize existing possible conditions, so that leadership can catch up with the masses and lead the high tide of the mass movement.
    In recent months, a high tide of socialist transformation has been set off across the country. In agriculture, Hebei Province is preparing to build 15,000 advanced agricultural production cooperatives before the spring plowing this year, and 24 counties have now achieved complete socialist cooperation. More than half of the farmers in Liaoning Province have joined advanced cooperatives, and Henan, Zhejiang and other places are also building a large number of advanced cooperatives. The speed at which the vast rural areas of our country are advancing on the socialist road is really changing rapidly. The speed of transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has also been greatly accelerated. Following the complete joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce in Beijing, the capitalist industry and commerce in Tianjin and Xi'an have also been completely jointly owned; in Shanghai, where capitalist industry and commerce is most concentrated in our country, private industry and commerce will also be completely jointly owned in the near future. The socialist transformation of handicrafts in all parts of the country has also accelerated accordingly.
    In order to better lead the high tide of the socialist transformation movement that has been universally launched in various places, according to the experience of Beijing and the existing experience of other cities, the first thing to do is to establish a clear concept in the guiding ideology, that is, to support and meet the enthusiasm and urgent requirements of the masses to take the socialist road as much as possible, and to make organizational work in all aspects catch up with the needs of the development of the situation as much as possible, and not be bound by the old ways of working. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China seized the favorable opportunity of the urgent demand of industry and commerce to implement joint state-private ownership, and timely changed the original work plan, and carried out the work of implementing joint state-private ownership in the entire industry in three steps: the first step is to approve joint state-private ownership, production and operation remain the same, and all employees remain unchanged; the second step is to rely on the joint efforts of workers, shop assistants and capitalists to carry out inventory and asset verification; the third step is to carry out economic restructuring and adjust the commercial network. The leadership of the joint venture work adopts the method of industry planning and unified leadership by the Municipal Party Committee. The advantage of doing this is that it is fast and not chaotic. Capitalists are in high spirits that the government can approve the implementation of joint state-private ownership of their enterprises in a timely manner. The method of being fast and good in agriculture and handicrafts is also warmly welcomed. In order to adapt to the urgent wishes of the vast number of handicraftsmen, Beijing has changed the original method of transforming by district, industry, batch, and area, and adopted the method of organizing the entire city by industry. Because it has mastered the characteristics of relatively concentrated handicraft production, relatively simple tools, and relatively easy organization of advanced cooperatives, the vast majority of them organized advanced handicraft production cooperatives from the beginning of this large-scale organization of production cooperatives, or expanded on the basis of the original cooperatives, which greatly accelerated the speed of transformation. The fact that the suburbs of Beijing have successfully built advanced agricultural production cooperatives also eloquently shows that the transition from primary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives is not as difficult as some people imagine. As long as there are conditions such as members being voluntary, having strong leadership backbone, and more than 90% of members being able to increase their income after the transition to advanced cooperatives, advanced cooperatives can be established. Grasping leadership, doing a good job in production, and under normal circumstances, primary cooperatives can have such conditions after two or three years of operation. Some newly established primary cooperatives, under the influence and leadership of old cooperatives, as long as they have been operated for a period of time, the members' awareness has been further improved, and they can be transformed into advanced cooperatives.
    In the high tide of the socialist transformation movement, we must trust the masses and rely on the masses. Beijing's experience proves that relying on the workers and fully utilizing the enthusiasm of the capitalists is of great significance to accelerating the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. For example, inventory and asset verification is a very complicated task. Beijing mainly carries out this work by capitalists self-reporting, self-evaluating, employees supervising, and industry work committees (composed of professional companies, trade associations, and employee representatives) approving. Therefore, in the inventory and asset verification, capitalists are actively striving to make contributions to socialism and participating in the work nervously and happily. Many capitalists also took out off-book assets and invested in enterprises. In just three or four days, the inventory and asset verification work was completed, and it basically met the requirements of seeking truth from facts, fairness and rationality, which enabled the government and business departments to free up their hands and concentrate their efforts on economic restructuring and adjusting the commercial network.
    We warmly congratulate the farmers in the suburbs of the capital, the handicraftsmen and private industrialists and businessmen of the capital, and congratulate them on stepping into a new stage on the road of socialist transformation. We also wish the farmers, handicraftsmen and private industrialists and businessmen in all parts of the country to achieve great achievements in the cause of socialist transformation more quickly.

    在高潮的最前面
    昨天，北京市各界20多万人在天安门广场举行庆祝社会主义改造胜利联欢大会。在全国社会主义改造的高潮中，光荣的首都郊区的农民、首都的手工业者和工商业者，在工人阶级的领导下，起了积极的带头作用，走在高潮的最前面。我们热烈地向他们致贺。
    北京市的社会主义改造工作能够以这样空前的速度、壮阔的规模、健康的步伐前进，说明了我们的党和政府对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的政策不但完全符合于我国的具体条件，符合于广大农民、手工业者和私营工商业者的普遍要求，而且经过几年来的实施，已经在各方面打下了巩固的基础，现在已经到了“水到渠成、瓜熟蒂落”的时候了。在农业方面，北京郊区的农民在去年已经全部参加了初级农业生产合作社，牲口、农具已经公有化，老社的生产发展了，社员的收入增加了，土地分红的比例逐渐降低，农民的社会主义觉悟日益提高，大家认识到初级社限制了生产力的继续发展，非前进一步不可了。4年来在郊区建立的77个高级社所表现的优越性，也成为引导农民向高级社前进的巨大力量。在这种情况下，初级社向高级社的转变，就成为自然的趋势了。在手工业方面，到1955年底，北京市已有36％以上的手工业者组织了400多个合作社，加上参加初级互助合作组织的就占47％以上。各区都成立了手工业劳动者协会，不仅取得了办社的经验，还培养了大批的积极分子，经过短期训练，他们就成为建社的骨干。特别是在去年，中共北京市委加强了对手工业合作化的领导，各区都集中力量对手工业生产组织进行系统的整顿以后，大大提高了广大社（组）员和个体手工业劳动者的思想觉悟和生产积极性。许多手工业生产合作社都表现了组织起来的优越性。这就给今年在全市手工业中实行社会主义合作化打下了有利的基础。在资本主义工商业的社会主义改造方面，北京市的资本主义工商业绝大部分是中、小型的工厂和商店，在过去几年内，资本主义工商业已经基本上采取了国家资本主义的各种形式。资本家的政治觉悟也不断提高，他们认识到只有积极接受社会主义改造，才是唯一的光明前途。特别是在毛主席对工商界的指示和中华全国工商业联合会执行委员会第二次会议的精神传达以后，工商界进一步认识到自己的前途必须和国家的前途结合起来，才能够掌握自己的命运。因此，他们决心走社会主义的道路，纷纷申请公私合营。这就给全市按行业全部实行公私合营创造了有利的条件。
    北京的经验对于全国其他各大城市的社会主义改造工作是有示范作用的。全国各地也应该根据具体情况把社会主义的规划放在最积极最可靠的基础上，彻底克服保守主义的倾向，充分运用已有的可能条件，使领导赶到群众的前面，去领导群众运动的高潮。
    最近几个月来，全国各地都掀起了社会主义改造的高潮。在农业方面，河北省准备在今年春耕以前建成15，000个高级农业生产合作社，现在已有24个县实现完全社会主义的合作化。辽宁省已有半数以上的农户参加了高级社，河南、浙江等地也正在大量建立高级社。我国广大农村在社会主义道路上前进的速度真是一日千里。资本主义工商业的改造速度也大大加快了。继北京市资本主义工商业全部公私合营之后，天津和西安两市的资本主义工商业也全部公私合营了；在我国资本主义工商业最集中的上海市，私营的工商业也将在最近全部实行公私合营。全国各地手工业的社会主义改造工作，也都相应地加快了速度。
    为了更好地领导各地普遍展开的社会主义改造运动的高潮，按照北京市的经验和其他城市已有的经验，首先要在领导思想上树立一种明确的观念，这就是必须尽量支持和满足群众走社会主义道路的积极性和迫切要求，并且使各方面的组织工作尽量赶上形势发展的需要，不被老一套工作方法束缚住自己。中共北京市委抓住了工商业迫切要求实行公私合营的有利时机，及时地改变了原来的工作规划，把实行全行业公私合营的工作分三个步骤来进行：第一步是批准公私合营，生产经营照旧，从业人员一律不动；第二步是依靠工人、店员和资本家的群策群力，进行清产核资；第三步是进行经济改组和调整商业网的工作。对于合营工作的领导，采取按行业规划，由市委统一领导的方法。这样做的好处是快而不乱。资本家对于政府能够及时批准他们的企业实行公私合营，情绪十分高涨。在农业和手工业方面采取又快又好的办法同样受到热烈欢迎。为了适应广大手工业者的迫切愿望，北京市改变了原来以区为单位按行业分期、分批、分片改造的办法，采用了以全市按行业全部组织起来的办法。由于掌握了手工业生产比较集中、工具比较简单、组织高级社也比较容易等特点，在这次大规模组织生产合作社的时候，绝大部分一开始就组织了高级的手工业生产合作社，或者在原有合作社的基础上加以扩大，大大加快了改造的速度。北京市郊区胜利建成农业生产合作社高级社的事实，也雄辩地说明了初级社转为高级社，并不像有些人想像的那么困难。只要具备社员自愿，有较强的领导骨干，并且在转为高级社以后90％以上的社员都能增加收入等条件，就可以建立高级社。抓紧领导、搞好生产，在一般情况下，初级社办了二、三年，就可以具备这样的条件，有些新建立的初级社，在老社的影响和带动下，只要办了一个时期，社员的觉悟更进一步提高了，就可以转为高级社。
    在社会主义改造运动的高潮中，必须相信群众和依靠群众。北京市的经验证明，依靠职工，并且充分利用资本家的积极性，对于加快对私营工商业的社会主义改造的工作有很大意义。例如清产核资是十分复杂的工作，北京市进行这个工作主要是由资本家自报、自评，职工监督，行业工作委员会（由专业公司、同业公会、职工代表三方组成）批准。因此，在清产核资中，资本家都积极地争取为社会主义立功，紧张愉快地参加工作。很多资本家还拿出账外资财，投入企业。仅仅三、四天的时间，清产核资工作就完成了，并且基本上达到了实事求是、公平合理的要求，这就使政府和业务部门能够腾出手来，集中力量去进行经济改组和调整商业网等工作。
    我们热烈地向首都郊区的农民，首都的手工业者和私营工商业者致贺，祝贺他们在社会主义改造的道路上踏进了新的阶段。我们也预祝全国各地的农民、手工业者和私营工商业者更快地在社会主义改造的事业中得到伟大的成就。
