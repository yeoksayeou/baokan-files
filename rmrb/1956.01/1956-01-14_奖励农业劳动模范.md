    The socialist transformation movement in agriculture is currently surging unprecedentedly. Over 60% of farm households nationwide have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and further development is expected before the spring plowing season. With the upsurge of the cooperative movement, an agricultural production upswing is inevitable. Now, the Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China has promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Rewarding Agricultural Production Increase Models," which will play a significant role in promoting the upsurge of the agricultural production increase movement.
    Rewarding agricultural labor models and promoting advanced high-yield experiences are important policies for promoting the continuous upsurge of agricultural production. As early as the recovery period of China's agricultural production, the former Central People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture promulgated the trial implementation measures for agricultural bumper harvest awards, greatly encouraging farmers' patriotic enthusiasm for increasing production, and discovering and cultivating a large number of heroic models, who played a leading role in the development of China's agricultural production movement.
    With the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement and the increase of socialist economic components in agriculture, in 1955, a large number of unprecedented bumper harvest cases emerged across the country. In Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, the average yield of more than 300,000 mu of double-cropping rice reached 1,002 jin per mu; in Chenghai County, the average yield of 160,000 mu of double-cropping rice reached 1,076 jin per mu. These two counties were called "Thousand Jin Counties." The average yield of late rice in the Yun Guang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jieyang County was 1,158 jin per mu. Coupled with the early rice harvest, the average yield per mu reached 2,020 jin. In the Manas River Basin Reclamation Area of Xinjiang, 80,114 mu of cotton fields produced nearly 400 jin of seed cotton per mu on average. In Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, 520,000 mu of cotton fields produced 85 jin of ginned cotton per mu on average. The high-yield winter wheat in the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, reached 1,173 jin per mu, and the high-yield corn in this cooperative reached 1,624 jin per mu. The average yield of 500 mu of spring corn in the Xujiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Ji County, Hebei Province, reached 930 jin per mu. In Fuqing County, Fujian Province, 460 mu of sweet potatoes yielded more than 10,000 jin per mu on average, and some high-yield fields yielded more than 20,000 jin per mu.
    These bumper harvest achievements are the result of the selfless labor of the vast number of cooperative farmers, employees of state-owned agricultural enterprises, and agricultural science and technology workers in tapping the potential of agricultural production. Their bumper harvest achievements should be rewarded, and their advanced experience should be widely disseminated. Rewarding various agricultural production increase models and promoting various advanced production experiences can encourage the vast number of farmers to learn from advanced producers, universally improve labor productivity, widely improve farming techniques, raise the backward production level to the advanced production level, and strive to complete and overfulfill agricultural production plans ahead of schedule.
    This regulation promulgated by the Ministry of Agriculture mainly rewards socialist and semi-socialist economic components in agriculture, and also gives appropriate rewards to individual farmers, herdsmen, and fishermen who meet the conditions. This will promote the rapid development of agricultural cooperativization. This regulation takes into account the complex conditions of different natural conditions and different production bases in various regions, and stipulates that units and individuals that exceed the province's production level can receive appropriate rewards. In this way, it will mobilize the enthusiasm of more people. This regulation attaches great importance to improving agricultural technology. Those who have important creations and inventions in science and technology, or who have made significant achievements in popularizing science and technology, can be rewarded, which will inevitably promote agricultural science and technology workers to work hard to research and create, and further improve agricultural technology. In order to encourage continuous improvement in production and maintain stable production increase achievements, this regulation also stipulates the conditions for re-applying for awards. In order to encourage collective production and prevent the growth of individual heroism, this regulation also stipulates a method of combining rewards for collectives and individuals.
    Rewarding agricultural production increase models must be combined with the organization of patriotic production increase competitions in agriculture. Now, semi-socialist and socialist economic components have already occupied an advantage in agriculture, which provides a solid organizational foundation for organizing socialist competitions in agriculture. In order to more widely organize labor competitions between societies and between production teams within societies, provide regular guidance and assistance, conduct serious evaluations, promptly announce competition results, encourage the labor production enthusiasm of members, and discover and cultivate more labor models, provinces and counties should plan to convene a labor model conference before this year's spring plowing to reward the agricultural production increase models that have emerged; at the same time, agricultural exhibitions should be planned to showcase typical cases of various typical figures with exhibits, pictures, charts, texts, etc. This is an effective way to organize agricultural production increase competitions and promote the upsurge of agricultural production, and all localities should make full use of it.
    Party and government leading organs at all levels must fully recognize the great significance of rewarding labor models, closely rely on agricultural production cooperatives, carry out socialist labor competitions in agricultural production, push the agricultural production increase movement to a new upsurge, and strive to complete and over fulfill the first five-year plan for agricultural production in 1956.

    奖励农业劳动模范
    目前农业的社会主义改造运动空前高涨，全国已有60％以上的农户加入农业生产合作社，估计春耕以前还会有一定程度的发展。随着合作化运动的高涨，必然会出现一个农业生产的高潮。现在中华人民共和国农业部公布了“关于奖励农业增产模范的暂行规定”，它对促进农业增产运动的高涨将会发生重大的作用。
    奖励农业劳动模范，推广先进丰产经验，是促进农业生产不断高涨的一项重要的政策。远在我国农业生产恢复时期，前中央人民政府农业部就曾经颁布了农业丰产奖励试行办法，大大鼓舞了农民的爱国主义增产积极性，发现和培养了大批英雄模范，他们在发展我国的农业生产运动中起了带头作用。
    随着农业合作化运动的发展和农业中社会主义经济成分的增长，在1955年，全国各地涌现出大量前所未有的丰产事例。广东省潮安县30多万亩双季稻每亩平均产量达到1，002斤；澄海县16万亩双季稻每亩平均产量达到1，076斤，这两个县被称为“千斤县”。揭阳县云光农业生产合作社晚稻丰产田每亩平均产量为1，158斤，加上早稻的收成，每亩产量平均达到2，020斤。新疆玛纳斯河流域垦区80，114亩棉田，每亩平均生产籽棉近四百斤。浙江省慈溪县有52万亩棉田每亩平均生产皮棉85斤。陕西省醴泉县烽火农业合作社的丰产冬小麦每亩产量达到1，173斤，这个社的丰产玉米每亩产量达到1，624斤。河北省冀县徐家庄农业合作社的五百亩春玉米每亩平均产量达到930斤。福建省福清县有460亩甘薯每亩平均产量达一万斤以上，有些高产田每亩产量达二万斤以上。
    这些丰产成绩，是广大合作化的农民、国营农业企业的职工、农业科学技术工作者以忘我的劳动，发掘农业生产潜力的结果。他们的丰产成绩应该得到奖励，他们的先进经验应该得到广泛的传播。奖励各种各样的农业增产模范，推广各种各样的先进生产经验，就可以鼓励广大农民向先进生产者看齐，普遍地提高劳动生产率，广泛地改进耕作技术，把落后的生产水平提高到先进的生产水平，争取提前和超额完成农业生产计划。
    农业部公布的这个条例，以奖励农业中社会主义和半社会主义经济成分为主，对于符合条件的个体农民、牧民、渔民，也给以适当的奖励。这就会促进农业合作化的迅速发展。这个条例照顾了各个地区自然条件差异和生产基础不同的复杂条件，规定凡是超过本省生产水平的单位和个人，都能得到适当的奖励。这样，它就会把更多的人的积极性动员起来。这个条例十分重视提高农业技术的重要性，凡是在科学技术上有重要的创造发明，或者对普及科学技术有显著成效的，都可以得到奖励，这就必然推动农业科学技术工作者努力钻研创造，进一步改进农业技术。为了鼓励生产的不断提高和保持稳定的增产成绩，这个条例也规定了再次报奖的条件。为了鼓励集体生产，防止个人英雄主义的滋长，这个条例还规定了奖励集体和个人相结合的办法。
    奖励农业增产模范必须和组织农业生产的爱国增产竞赛结合起来。现在半社会主义的和社会主义的经济成分已经在农业中占了优势，这就使组织农业的社会主义竞赛有了坚实的组织基础。为了更广泛地组织社与社之间、社内的生产队与生产队之间的劳动竞赛，经常给以指导和帮助，认真地进行评比，及时公布竞赛成绩，鼓舞社员的劳动生产积极性，发现和培养更多的劳动模范，各省、县要在今年春耕以前有计划地召开一次劳动模范会议，对已经出现的农业增产模范进行奖励；同时应该有计划地举行农业展览会，把各种典型人物的典型事例，用实物、图画、图表、文字等展览出来。这是组织农业增产竞赛，促进农业生产高涨的有效办法，各地要充分地加以利用。
    各级党政领导机关必须充分认识奖励劳动模范的重大意义，紧紧地依靠农业生产合作社，开展农业生产的社会主义劳动竞赛，把农业增产运动推向新的高涨，争取在1956年完成和超额完成农业生产的第一个五年计划。
