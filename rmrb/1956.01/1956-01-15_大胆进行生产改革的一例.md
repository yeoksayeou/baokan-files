An Example of Boldly Carrying Out Production Reform
Chen Xiuzheng, Secretary of the CPC Daxing County Committee, Hebei Province
Yin Junfeng, Member of the CPC Daxing County Committee, Daxing County, Hebei Province

Daxing County is a relatively poor county in Hebei Province. 70% of the county's cultivated land is low-lying, with both alkali and sand, and nine out of ten years suffer from waterlogging, making it impossible to grow crops. Grain is not self-sufficient year after year, relying entirely on large-scale supplies from the state. In 1953, a year considered a bumper harvest, the state still supplied 22 million jin of grain. In 1954, the disaster situation was serious, and the state supplied 42 million jin of grain. The masses commonly said: "Hoping for a better year next year, but next year is still a tattered cotton-padded jacket." Obviously, without carrying out production reform, not only would the people's lives not be fundamentally improved, but the grain supply for this county would become a constant burden on the state.

In order to completely change this situation, the CPC Daxing County Committee, after repeated discussions, determined the principle of adapting to nature, transforming nature, eliminating disasters, and striving for high yields. In the autumn of 1954, it organized 50 cadres from agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and other relevant departments to conduct a comprehensive survey of the county's low-lying areas. The survey showed that there were 100,000 mu of land suitable for reclaiming paddy fields, more than 260,000 mu of land suitable for digging ditches for furrowed fields, and 120,000 mu of land suitable for converting to dry rice cultivation. Based on this survey, a preliminary production reform plan was formulated: reclaim 3,500 mu of paddy fields, plant 10,000 mu of dry rice, and dig ditches for furrowed fields on 8,000 mu. Because the masses did not have the habit of production reform, and the county committee lacked experience in leading production reform, there were, of course, great difficulties in realizing this plan. Even some members of the county committee lacked confidence in this reform and feared "rash advance." However, the majority of the county committee comrades believed that since the masses had an urgent need for production reform, the Party had a strong determination to lead production reform, and the natural conditions suitable for production reform had been investigated, this was a guarantee that the reform could succeed. Among these three production reforms, the task of transforming alkaline land into paddy fields was the most arduous. Therefore, the county committee regarded the work of leading the reclamation of 3,500 mu of paddy fields in the Lucheng area as the focus of leading production reform.

In formulating a concrete plan for reclaiming paddy fields, a major difficulty was encountered: insufficient water sources. Although there were two rivers in the Lucheng area, an investigation of the annual water volume of these two rivers revealed that even if all the river water was stored in reservoirs, it would still not meet the needs of 3,500 mu of paddy fields. What to do? The county committee believed that there was only one way: to tap underground water sources. But how to tap them? Everyone was at a loss. They turned through many books and periodicals on water conservancy, but could not find any records of extracting large amounts of underground water in low-lying areas. The county committee finally decided to go deep into the masses and find a solution. As a result, this method was indeed found in Efang and Lidai villages near the Yongding River. Moreover, it was learned that some of the masses in this area had 15 years of experience in diverting water for drought resistance, but the county committee had not discovered it in the past. The method of extracting water was to dig water pits underground, install pipes in the pits, use the pipes to draw the underground water into the pits, and then use waterwheels to pump the water from the pits into the paddy fields. The masses called these water pits "water bubbles," and one water bubble could irrigate at most two mu of paddy fields. Inspired by the successful experience of the masses, the county committee made a plan to develop underground water sources, that is, according to the principle of "water bubbles," the water pits were lengthened, deepened, and widened, and the number of pipes was increased, and then machines were used to pump water, so that the irrigation of large areas of paddy fields could be guaranteed. Everyone called this water conservancy equipment a "water tank." After the plan was determined, the construction of reservoirs and water tanks started in full swing in November 1954. Unexpectedly, shortly after construction began, another major problem arose: quicksand appeared everywhere, affecting the progress of the project. This kind of quicksand, also known as "mushroom sand," would cause two scoops of water and sand to gush out like mushrooms for every scoop you dug. After repeated research by the county committee and repeated experiments in the project, the method of driving wooden piles internally and blocking with thorn hedges externally was adopted, which finally stopped the quicksand and solved the key problem in the project.

The process of production reform is not only a process of struggle against nature, but also a process of struggle against conservative and backward thinking within the Party and among the masses. From the very beginning, the county committee paid attention to giving play to the role of local Party organizations and combined production reform with Party rectification work. For example, Lucheng Township had a total of 37 Party members. Some Party members were not interested in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and were indifferent to production reform. The county committee assisted the branch in rectification, commended active Party members, educated and criticized inactive Party members, and expelled four Party members with serious capitalist ideas who did not accept Party education from the Party. At the same time, efforts were made to cultivate activists who emerged in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the production reform movement, and 16 outstanding members were successively admitted to the Party. This greatly purified the Party organization and greatly strengthened the branch's role as a bastion in production reform. In the production reform, it also encountered resistance from the conservative thinking of some of the masses. Some people said, "Planting depends on man, harvest depends on heaven." They did not believe that production reform could succeed, so they were not active in going to work. Some people, seeing that steam engines for pumping water had been bought, did not increase their confidence, but instead had concerns, worrying that too much money would be spent and they would not be able to pay it back in the future. In order to publicize the Party's various policies, dispel the various concerns of the masses, and inspire the masses' labor enthusiasm, the county committee trained 170 propagandists in the area where paddy fields were being reclaimed, formed a Party propaganda team, and used various occasions to carry out propaganda to the masses, which played a great role in production reform.

The production reform that benefits the people made the class enemies jealous, and they used every opportunity to carry out sabotage activities. Some spread rumors to confuse the public, which once greatly reduced the number of people going to work in Lucheng Township. Some carried out sabotage in the project, causing 36 pipes to fail to produce water. Some even dug dikes to release water, releasing more than 400,000 cubic meters of water from a reservoir, which directly affected the irrigation of paddy fields. On the one hand, the county committee carried out education on class struggle among the masses to raise the masses' vigilance, and at the same time strengthened the security work in the production reform. And the government arrested five saboteurs with conclusive evidence according to law, preventing the rampant sabotage activities of the class enemies.

In March 1955, the construction of three "water tank" projects with a total length of 2,700 meters, 163 pipes installed, and 9 pumps installed was successfully completed. The plans for converting to dry rice and digging ditches for furrowed fields were also realized. During the autumn harvest season, all the results of the production reform were displayed. The yield per mu of furrowed fields was increased by 50 jin, the yield per mu of dry rice was increased by 150 jin, especially the newly reclaimed paddy fields, which in the past often had no harvest at all, yielded 400 jin per mu in 1955. In the past, the Lucheng area needed the state to allocate more than 200,000 yuan of relief funds and living loans, and needed the state to supply more than 1 million jin of grain. In 1955, in addition to being self-sufficient in grain, it also sold 400,000 jin to the state. The initial victory of the production reform promoted the rapid development of the cooperation movement. Before the autumn of 1954, only 12% of farmers in Lucheng Township had joined cooperatives. Now, 99.5% of farmers have joined cooperatives and have completed complete socialist cooperation. The entire township has been built into a large advanced cooperative with 807 households.

The victory of the three production reforms has also promoted a surge in production reform throughout the county. According to statistics as of early January this year, the "water tank" project for the more than 50,000 mu of paddy fields planned to be reclaimed this year has all started construction, and 10 "water tanks" with a total length of 7,800 meters, irrigating 15,000 mu of paddy fields, have all been completed. Of the 260,000 mu of land planned to be ditched for furrowed fields this year, 60,000 mu have been completed. According to the county committee's production plan, the county's economic landscape will undergo fundamental changes in 1956, and the total grain output will reach 210 million jin. Not only will it no longer need state supplies, but it can also provide more than 80 million jin of surplus grain to support the country's socialist construction.

This proves that the conservative thinking on production reform must be broken. As long as we grasp the natural conditions, as long as we believe in the masses and believe in the Party, we will definitely be able to transform non-production into high production and low production into high production, and we will definitely be able to change the backward state of production.

    大胆进行生产改革的一例
    中共河北省大兴县县委书记  陈修政
    中共河北省大兴县县委委员  尹俊峰
    大兴县是河北省的一个比较穷困的县，全县70％的耕地面积地势低洼，既有碱，又有砂，十年九涝，不长庄稼。粮食年年不能自给，全靠国家大量供应。1953年算丰收年份，国家还供应粮食2，200万斤。1954年灾情严重，国家就供应粮食4，200万斤。群众中普遍流传着一句话：“今年盼望明年好，明年还是破棉袄”。显然，不进行生产改革，不仅群众的生活无法得到根本的改善，而且对这个县的粮食供应，将成为国家的经常负担。
    为了彻底改变这种状况，中共大兴县委经过多次讨论，确定了适应自然、改造自然、消灭灾荒、争取丰产的方针；并且在1954年的秋后，组织了农林、水利等有关部门的50名干部，对全县低洼地区作了全面调查。调查表明，全县适宜开垦稻田的土地有10万亩，适宜挖沟洫畦田的土地有26万多亩，适宜改种旱稻的土地有12万亩。根据这一调查，制定了初步生产改革计划：开垦稻田3，500亩，种旱稻1万亩，挖沟洫畦田8，000亩。由于群众没有生产改革的习惯，县委又缺乏领导生产改革的经验，实现这个计划，当然有很大困难，甚至部分县委委员对这一改革都缺乏信心，害怕“冒进”。可是县委的多数同志认为：既然群众有生产改革的迫切要求，党有领导生产改革的坚强决心，又调查了适宜进行生产改革的自然条件，这就是改革能够成功的保证。在这三项生产改革中，变碱地为稻田的任务最为艰巨。因此，县委就把领导芦城一带开垦3，500亩稻田的工作作为领导生产改革的重心。
    在制定开垦稻田的具体计划中，碰到一个很大的困难，就是水源不足。芦城一带虽有两条河流，但经过对这两条河常年水量的调查发现，即使把河水全部用水库储蓄起来，仍然不能满足3，500亩稻田的需要。怎么办呢？县委认为只有一条办法，就是挖掘地下水源。可是怎样挖掘呢？大家束手无策，翻了多少有关水利的书刊，却找不到在低洼地区取大量地下水的记载。县委最后决定，深入群众，寻找办法。结果这种办法在靠近永定河的鹅坊和立岱村果真找到了。而且了解了这个地方的部分群众已有15年引水抗旱的经验，只是县委过去没有发现。取水的办法是在地下挖水坑，坑内装管子，用管子把地下水引到坑里来，再用水车把水从坑里灌到稻田里去。群众把这种水坑叫作“水泡子”，一个水泡子最多能灌溉两亩稻田。在群众这一成功经验启发之下，县委作出了开辟地下水源的计划，即按照“水泡子”的原理，把水坑延长、加深、加宽，并且把管子加多，再用机器抽水，这样就可以保证大面积稻田的灌溉。大家把这种水利设备叫做“水柜”。计划确定之后，1954年11月间，水库和水柜的工程全面动工了。不料动工不久之后，又发生了一个大问题，流沙到处出现，影响工程进展。这种流沙，又叫“蘑菇沙”，你挖一铣下去，连水带沙就像蘑菇似的冒出两铣来。县委反复研究并在工程中一再试验以后，采取了内打木桩、外拦荆排的办法，终于制止了流沙，解决了工程中的关键问题。
    生产改革的过程，不仅是同自然作斗争的过程，也是同党内和群众中的保守落后思想作斗争的过程。县委一开始就注意了发挥当地党组织的作用，并且把生产改革和整党工作结合起来进行。如芦城乡共有党员37名，有些党员对互助合作运动没有兴趣，对生产改革也漠不关心。县委就协助支部进行整顿，对积极的党员加以表扬，对不积极的党员加以教育和批评，并且把4个资本主义思想严重又不接受党的教育的党员开除出党。同时努力培养互助合作运动和生产改革运动中涌现出来的积极分子，并把其中的16名优秀分子先后吸收入党。这就大大纯洁了党的组织，也大大加强了支部在生产改革中的堡垒作用。在生产改革中，也受到了部分群众保守思想的抵抗。有人说：“种在人，收在天”，他们不相信生产改革能够成功，因此出工不积极。有人看到买来了抽水的锅驼机，不是增加了信心，而是产生了顾虑，耽心钱花多了，以后还不清。为了宣传党的各项政策，解除群众各种顾虑，鼓舞群众的劳动热情，县委在开垦稻田的地区训练了170名宣传员，组成党的宣传队伍，利用各种场合向群众进行宣传，这对生产改革起了很大作用。
    给人民造福的生产改革，使阶级敌人看得眼红，他们利用一切机会，进行破坏活动。有的造谣惑众，一度使芦城乡的出工人数大大减少；有的在工程中进行破坏，使36眼管子不能出水；有的甚至扒堤放水，放走一个水库的40多万立方公尺的水量，使稻田灌溉直接受到影响。县委一方面对群众进行阶级斗争的教育，提高群众的警惕，同时加强生产改革中的保卫工作。并由政府把罪证确凿的5个破坏分子依法逮捕，制止了阶级敌人猖狂的破坏活动。
    1955年3月间，全长2，700公尺，下管163眼，装抽水机9台的3个“水柜”工程胜利完工。改种旱稻和挖沟洫畦田的计划也都实现。秋收时节，生产改革的全部成果显示出来了。沟洫畦田的每亩产量提高了50斤，旱稻每亩产量提高了150斤，特别是新开垦的稻田，过去常颗粒无收，1955年每亩收了400斤。芦城一带往年需要国家投放20多万元救济款和生活贷款，需要国家供应100多万斤粮食，1955年的粮食除过自给，还卖给国家40万斤。生产改革的初步胜利，促进了合作化运动的迅速发展。芦城乡在1954年秋前只有12％的农户入社，现在已经有99.5％的农户入社，并且完成了完全社会主义的合作化，全乡建成一个807户的大型高级社。
    三项生产改革的胜利，也推动了全县生产改革的热潮。截至今年1月初的统计，今年计划开垦的5万多亩稻田的“水柜”工程已经全部动工，并有全长7，800公尺，灌溉15，000亩稻田的10个“水柜”全部建成。今年计划挖沟洫畦田26万亩的工程，也有6万亩已经完工。按照县委的生产规划，1956年全县的经济面貌将要发生根本变化，粮食总产量将达到2.1亿斤，不仅再不要国家供应，还可拿出8，000多万斤余粮支援国家的社会主义建设。
    由此证明，生产改革上的保守思想必须打破，只要我们掌握了自然情况，只要我们相信群众又相信党，就一定能够把不产变为丰产，把低产变为高产，一定可以改变生产落后的状况。
