To the Editor:

    The Minsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yangjiagang Village, Second District, Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, attaches great importance to the safekeeping of new farm tools. In this cooperative, farm tools are not allowed to be scattered and thrown around after use. They are promptly put into storage. Those that cannot be stored are covered with straw mats. Therefore, no rust damage or loss of farm tools has occurred in the cooperative.

    However, most agricultural production cooperatives in Huachuan County do not take good care of their new farm tools. According to a survey of 32 cooperatives in the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 6th districts, the common shortcomings are: lack of farm tool storage warehouses or sheds, farm tools scattered everywhere, exposed to wind, rain, and heavy snow. As a result, most farm tools have rusted, and even parts have been lost. The seven sets of new farm tools of the Mingxing Cooperative in Gongcheng Village, Second District, are piled up in the yard and have all rusted and have incomplete parts. If they are not repaired before spring plowing this year, they will become useless. The Agricultural Technology Extension Station in the Second District has scattered 13 double-wheeled double-shared plows, 20 harvesters, 11 disc harrows, 2 single-shared plows, 4 seeders, and 3 rollers in the yard, causing incomplete and rusted machines. Therefore, we believe that promoting the proper safekeeping of new farm tools so that they can play a greater role in agricultural production is an urgent task that should be given widespread attention in all regions.

### 教育农民保管好新农具

    教育农民保管好新农具编辑同志：
    黑龙江省桦川县二区杨家岗村民生农业生产合作社很重视新式农具的保管工作。在这个社里，农具用过以后不准散放乱扔，及时入库，不能入库的，也都用草帘苫盖。因此，社里就没有发生过锈坏或丢失农具的现象。
    但是，桦川县的大多数农业生产合作社对新农具是保管得不够好的。根据二、三、五、六这4个区32个社的调查，普遍存在的缺点是：没有农具保管仓库或保管棚、农具散放各处，听任风吹雨淋和大雪漫盖。因此，大部分农具都已经生锈了，甚至还发生了丢失零件的现象。二区公胜村明星社的7套新农具堆放在大院里，已经全部生锈和零件残缺不全；如果今年春耕前不检修，就会变成废物。二区农业技术推广分站，竟把13台双轮双铧犁、20台收割机、11台圆盘耙、2台一铧犁、4台播种机、3台镇压器散乱地扔在院内，造成机体残缺不全和锈坏现象。因此，我们认为：提倡保管好新农具，让新农具在农业生产中发挥更大的作用，是一件刻不容缓的工作，应该引起各地的普遍重视。
