    The upsurge of agricultural cooperation that began in the second half of last year broke the pessimistic argument that "the speed of agricultural development cannot keep up with the speed of industrial development" and prepared unprecedentedly favorable conditions for accelerating China's socialist industrialization.

    Not long after the country began large-scale economic construction, it was discovered that agricultural development was increasingly unable to meet the needs of industrial development. In the first two years of the First Five-Year Plan, agriculture failed to meet its production targets. This not only caused some tension in the grain issue but also directly brought certain difficulties to industry. For example, many factories operated under capacity due to insufficient supply of industrial raw materials. In 1954, the national utilization rate of cigarette equipment was about 30%, flour about 54%, and oil about 40%. Due to the severe flooding in 1954 and poor agricultural harvests, many light industries reduced production in 1955 due to insufficient agricultural raw materials: cotton yarn would be reduced by more than 600,000 pieces compared to 1954, cigarettes reduced by 180,000 cases, gunny sacks reduced by 18 million, and oil extraction reduced by 180,000 tons from the original plan.

    What is the reason that agricultural development cannot keep up with the needs of industrial development? This is because China's small-scale peasant economy accounts for a large proportion, and the small-scale peasant economy is not only difficult to expand reproduction but sometimes even simple reproduction is difficult to achieve. Some say that the failure of agricultural production to meet needs should be attributed to natural disasters, but in fact, it is precisely the small-scale peasant economy that is incapable of overcoming even minor natural disasters, let alone carrying out larger technological reforms. Not only that, but because the small-scale peasant economy is a self-sufficient, semi-consumption economy, the commercial grain and industrial raw materials it provides are both limited and difficult to incorporate into the national planned economy. For example, the task of many technical crops cannot be completed, often because the planned planting area cannot be completed as stipulated. Although last year was the best harvest year, the planting area of flue-cured tobacco in some areas only reached 50% to 60% of the plan, and the production task could not be completed. Many other technical crops have this situation as well. From this, it can be seen that if this small-scale peasant economy is maintained, it will not only be impossible to effectively improve production in general, but it will also be impossible to practically arrange the planting of various crops proportionally according to the national plan. If this situation continues, it will inevitably seriously affect the development of national industrialization.

    II

    In order to overcome this contradiction, the pace of national industrialization must not be delayed, but the process of transforming the small-scale peasant economy and the pace of agricultural cooperation must be accelerated. Gradually guiding the scattered small-scale peasant economy towards a cooperative economy is the only correct way to ensure the rapid increase in agricultural production. This has been proven by the historical experience of the Soviet Union, and it has also been illustrated by the experience of our country's actual movement.

    In the past six months, due to the vigorous development of agricultural cooperation, there have been nearly 2 million agricultural cooperatives nationwide, with member farmers accounting for more than 60% of the country's farmers. It is expected that the basic realization of cooperation will be achieved in most parts of the country this spring. In addition, tens of thousands of advanced cooperatives (i.e., collective farms) have appeared in various places, and batches of primary cooperatives are constantly being transformed into advanced cooperatives. This new situation in the cooperative movement will greatly promote the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation. The course of history eloquently proves that the foresight of our Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong and the principles and policies they have laid down are completely correct. At present, the new cooperatives in various places are not only actively rectifying their organizations but also formulating overall plans and working hard on various production and construction projects to fight for the early completion of the national five-year plan. This shows that with the arrival of the high tide of cooperation, a new high tide of agricultural production has begun to emerge.

    As is well known, agricultural cooperatives, due to their unified management, gradually connect the scattered small plots of land into large areas, which can rationally use labor, land, and draft animals. At the same time, it can also provide favorable conditions for improving technology, such as the use of new-style farm tools, improvement of farming methods, construction of small-scale water conservancy, and expansion of cultivated land area. Individual small farmers are unable to handle many things, but agricultural cooperatives can rely on collective strength to handle them. According to investigation materials from various places, China's original agricultural cooperatives can generally increase production by about 20% in the first two years of their establishment, and can maintain a certain proportion of increase in the future. And when they develop into advanced cooperatives (i.e., collective farms), they can better show their superiority in continuously improving production and increasing farmers' income. Not only that, but experience in various places proves that agricultural cooperatives are generally more likely to implement national plans.

    Here, an example of an advanced cooperative in a mountainous area without mechanization can be cited: Hucun Village in Jinyun County, Zhejiang Province, is a small mountain village. Most of the village's fields are small terraces with very low yields. However, since the establishment of the advanced agricultural, forestry and animal husbandry production cooperative in 1954, the situation has immediately changed. In the first year of the establishment of the cooperative, the total income of the entire cooperative increased by nearly one time compared with before the establishment of the cooperative. In the second year of the establishment of the cooperative, namely 1955, calculated according to the three major incomes of agriculture, forestry, and sideline occupations, it increased by more than 10,000 yuan compared with 1954. Due to the increase in grain and other crops, and the increase in the socialist consciousness of farmers, the amount of surplus grain sold by local farmers to the state has increased significantly. In 1954, 28 households in this cooperative sold 6,260 catties of surplus grain to the state and more than 50,000 catties of oil tea seeds to nearby supply and marketing cooperatives. In 1955, the cooperative expanded and sold even more surplus grain.

    From this, it can be seen that only by actively developing agricultural cooperation can we rapidly increase production and increase the commercial grain rate, thereby more forcefully supporting national industrialization.

    With the development of agricultural cooperation, agricultural labor productivity has been continuously improved: according to a survey in Heilongjiang, if the 22,000 agricultural cooperatives in the province are run well, 150,000 laborers and more than 100,000 draft animals and huge amounts of funds can be used to expand reproduction. This trend will be seen in all regions. Therefore, it is necessary to actively create conditions to gradually develop a multi-sector economy. If we cannot foresee this new situation, the leadership will fall behind the masses on the agricultural production front. Some people doubt whether the issue of surplus rural labor might arise, but in fact, this is nothing to worry about. We know that with the development of agricultural cooperation and the rapid progress of rural construction, in addition to agricultural production, the development of forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and other sideline production all require a large amount of labor. And a large amount of labor can also be accommodated in the construction of small-scale water conservancy, increasing fertilizer accumulation, building large and small roads, implementing greening, and eliminating crop diseases, pests, and mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows. Therefore, under the increasingly precise conditions of comprehensive planning, rural labor will be given greater play. On the other hand, new industrial bases are constantly being established, new agricultural bases are also being opened up (China has arable land roughly equivalent to the existing cultivated land area), and the development of transportation is all in need of planned labor input from rural areas.

    III

    As is well known, the distribution of agricultural productive forces in China in the old days was uneven. This historically inherited situation must be fundamentally changed. With the development of agricultural cooperation, it is possible to gradually formulate long-term, comprehensive production plans for a township, a district, a county, a province, and even the entire country. This means that we are now able to gradually achieve a new, rational, and even distribution of agricultural productive forces in accordance with socialist principles, in order to continuously promote the overall development of agriculture, thereby meeting the growing needs of industrial construction. Since new industrial bases are constantly being established, we must correspondingly open up new agricultural bases, and we must gradually make some light industries closer to the place of origin of agricultural raw materials, and gradually establish new cotton bases, various technical crop bases, and animal husbandry bases. To do these things, if it was impossible on the basis of a small-scale peasant economy, it will become increasingly possible with the development of agricultural cooperation.

    It should be seen that not only can an agricultural cooperative carry out reasonable crop rotation and other technological improvement measures due to the continuous operation of land, but also favorable conditions have increasingly been created in a region or even the whole country to gradually adjust the distribution of certain crops. At present, there is often a large difference in the average yield per unit area of the same crop in various regions of China. If we conduct serious research and specific analysis, and take effective measures, it will be beneficial to improve agricultural production. Here is a clear example: Last year, Zhejiang Province relatively concentrated some scattered cotton fields in Cixi County to plant 520,000 mu in order to conduct centralized technical guidance, and as a result, an average yield of 80 catties of ginned cotton per mu was obtained over such a large area. Needless to say, this can only be achieved on the basis of a certain degree of agricultural cooperation. The country currently has more than 80 million mu of cotton planting area, with an average yield of more than 31 catties of ginned cotton per mu. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps operates cotton fields more centrally and has taken several new technical measures. Last year, an average yield of 140 catties of ginned cotton per mu was obtained on a large area of 80,000 mu. And about 12 million mu of extremely scattered cotton fields across the country, due to backward cultivation techniques, only produce an average of about 15 catties of ginned cotton per mu. From this, it can be seen that on the basis of agricultural cooperation, gradually adjusting the distribution of existing crops appropriately, establishing several technical crop bases in an organized and planned manner, and concentrating on strengthening technical guidance in order to ensure high and stable yields are not only necessary but also possible. In addition, with the development of agricultural cooperation, favorable conditions have increasingly been created for the planning of mountain production and the planning of tropical and subtropical production. As long as we can take concrete measures, we will continue to unleash the potential of agricultural production in all aspects.

    IV

    China's task of socialist transformation of agriculture has two aspects: on the one hand, to transform the existing relations of production and lead small farmers to the path of cooperation; on the other hand, to transform the existing agricultural technical equipment and replace backward production tools with agricultural machinery. We are developing agricultural cooperation in order to prepare conditions for the realization of agricultural mechanization.

    At present, China is starting to build its first tractor manufacturing plant and is actively preparing to build its second and third tractor manufacturing plants. Once these factories are built and put into production, they will produce tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of tractors per year. In order to steadfastly realize large-scale socialist mechanized agriculture, it is necessary to gradually overcome the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of small farmers in the agricultural cooperation movement, transform their selfish mentality and loose habits, patiently help them cultivate the spirit of collective labor, continuously accumulate experience in management and operation, and train various leading cadres and activists. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives should be gradually developed from small to large and from low-level to high-level. Only by carrying out this series of arduous ideological and organizational work can we prepare the necessary conditions for the realization of large-scale socialist mechanized agriculture.

    Needless to say, agricultural cooperation plus agricultural mechanization will mark an unprecedented increase in China's agricultural productive forces. For this purpose, the two main sectors of the national economy—industry and agriculture—must adapt to and support each other. On the one hand, agriculture must supply industry with abundant commercial grain and industrial raw materials, and on the other hand, industry must supply agriculture with sufficient daily necessities and means of production (especially new technical equipment). This is the material foundation for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The realization of national socialist industrialization and agricultural technological transformation can guarantee the complete victory of socialism in our country and will enable social production to be continuously improved on a high technical basis to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people.

    In the past six months, after overcoming right-leaning conservative ideas in agriculture, a new upsurge of socialist transformation has emerged in China's rural areas, and tens of millions of farmers have joined semi-socialist cooperatives. With the rapid progress of agricultural cooperation, the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce is also forging ahead, breaking through the original planned targets. And the major victories in socialist transformation in these areas have provided us with favorable conditions to accelerate the pace of socialist industrialization. The issues of commercial grain and industrial raw materials, industrial capital accumulation, industrial markets, and the more planned development of industry, which we needed to solve earlier, will all be better resolved. Under this situation, China should naturally no longer stick to the original scale and speed of industrialization, but should appropriately expand and accelerate it. It is necessary to appropriately expand and accelerate the scale and speed of socialist industrialization in order to ensure that the two major sectors of China's national economy—industry and agriculture—rapidly advance towards the socialist road, and to promote the early completion of socialist construction.

    农业合作化的高潮为加速社会主义工业化准备了条件
    张庆泰
    一
    去年下半年开始到来的农业合作化的高潮，打破了“农业的发展速度不能和工业的发展速度相适应”的悲观论调，为加速我国社会主义工业化准备了空前有利的条件。
    国家开始大规模经济建设不久，曾经发现农业的发展日益不能满足工业发展的需要。第一个五年计划的前二年，农业就没有完成生产计划。这不仅造成粮食问题的某些紧张，而且直接给工业带来一定的困难。譬如由于工业原料供应不足，许多工厂开工不足。1954年全国卷烟设备利用率约为30％，面粉约为54％，油脂约为40％。由于1954年遭到严重水灾，农业收成不好，1955年许多轻工业因农产品原料不足而减产：棉纱将比1954年约减产60万件以上，卷烟减产18万箱，麻袋减产1，800万条，榨油也比原计划减产18万吨。
    农业的发展赶不上工业发展的需要，原因何在呢？这是由于我国小农经济占着很大的比重，而小农经济不仅难于扩大再生产，甚至有时连简单的再生产也难以实现。有人说农业生产不能满足需要应归咎于自然灾害，其实正是小农经济才既无力克服很小的自然灾害，又无力进行较大的技术改革。不仅如此，由于小农经济是自给自足的半消费性的经济，它所提供的商品粮食和工业原料既很有限度，又不容易纳入国家计划经济的轨道。譬如许多技术作物不能完成任务，时常是由于不能按计划规定完成播种面积。去年虽是收成最好的一年，而若干地区烤烟播种面积仅达计划的50％至60％，不能完成生产任务。许多其他技术作物也有这种情况。由此可见，如果保持这种小农经济，不仅不能一般地有效地提高生产，而且也不能切实根据国家计划按比例地安排各种作物的播种。如果这种情况继续下去，势必严重影响国家工业化的发展。
    二
    为了克服这种矛盾，绝不能延缓国家工业化的发展速度，而只能加快对小农经济的改造过程，加快农业合作化的发展速度。把分散的小农经济逐步引向合作经济，是保证迅速提高农业生产的唯一正确道路。这是苏联的历史经验已经证明了的，也是我国实际运动的经验已经说明了的。
    半年以来，由于农业合作化的蓬勃发展，全国已经有了将近200万个农业合作社，入社农户占全国农户60％以上。预计今年春季全国大部地区即将基本实现合作化。此外，各地已经出现了好几万个高级社（即集体农庄），而且还不断地有成批的初级社转为高级社。这种合作化运动的新形势将大大地促进国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业。历史进程雄辩地证明了我党中央和毛泽东同志的预见及其所规定的方针、政策是完全正确的。目前各地新社建立不久，就一面积极整顿组织，一面制定全面规划，紧张地投入各种生产建设，为提前完成国家五年计划而斗争。这就说明了随着合作化高潮的到来，农业生产的新高涨已经开始出现。
    如所周知，农业合作社由于它的统一经营，把分散的小块土地逐步连成大片，就可以合理地使用劳力、土地和耕畜等。同时也可以提供改进技术的有利条件，如采用新式农具、改进耕作方法、兴修小型水利以及扩大耕地面积等许多事情，个体小农无力举办，而农业合作社却能够依靠集体力量来举办。根据各地调查材料，我国原有的农业合作社，在它们初建的一两年，一般可增产20％左右，往后还可以保持一定的增产比例。而当它们发展为高级社（即集体农庄）的时候，就更可以显示它们不断提高生产、增加农民收入的优越性。不仅如此，各地经验证明，农业合作社一般地更容易贯彻执行国家的计划。
    这里可以举出一个没有机械化的山区高级社作为例证：浙江省缙云县胡村，是一个小山村。这村的田地绝大部分是面积很小的梯田，产量很低。但自1954年建立了高级农林牧生产合作社后，情况马上发生变化。建社的第一年，全社的总收入比办社前增加将近一倍。建社的第二年，即1955年，根据农业、林业、副业三项主要收入计算，又比1954年增加一万多元。由于粮食和其他作物增产，以及农民社会主义觉悟提高，当地农民向国家出售余粮的数量显著增加了。1954年，这个合作社28户人家就卖了6，260斤余粮给国家，卖了5万多斤油茶籽给附近的供销合作社。1955年，合作社扩大了，余粮卖得更多了。
    由此可见，只有积极发展农业合作化，才能迅速地提高生产，提高粮食商品率，从而更加有力地支援国家工业化。
    随着农业合作化的发展，农业劳动生产率已不断提高起来：根据黑龙江的调查，全省22，000 个农业合作社，如果办的好，将有15万个劳动力和十万多匹耕畜和巨量资金可以用于扩大再生产。各个地区都会看到这种趋势。因此，必须积极创造条件逐步发展多部门经济。如果不能预见到这种新的情况，领导上就会在农业生产战线上落在群众后面。有人怀疑，是否可能发生某些农村剩余劳动力的出路问题，其实这是无须顾虑的。我们知道，随着农业合作化的发展，农村建设的突飞猛进，除了农业生产以外，发展林业、畜牧业、渔业以及其他副业的生产，都需要大量的劳动力。而在兴修小型水利、增积肥料、建设大小道路、实行绿化、消灭作物病虫害和蚊蝇鼠雀等方面，也是可以容纳许多劳动力的。因此，在全面规划工作的日益精密的条件下，农村劳动力将得到更大发挥。另一方面，新的工业基地不断地建立，新的农业基地也正在开辟（我国拥有大致相当于现有耕地面积的可垦荒地），加以交通运输事业的发展，都是需要农村有计划地输送劳动力的。
    三
    如所周知，我国旧时农业生产力的分布是不平衡的。这种历史上遗留下来的状况必须根本加以改变。随着农业合作化的发展，一乡、一区、一县、一省直到整个国家，都有可能逐步制定长期的全面的生产规划。这就是说，我们已有可能按照社会主义原则，逐步做到农业生产力新的合理的均匀分布，以便不断促进农业的全面发展，从而满足工业建设日益增长的需要。既然新的工业基地不断建立，我们就必须相应地开辟新的农业基地，必须逐步做到使若干轻工业更接近农产品原料出产地，并逐步建立新的棉花基地，各种技术作物基地以及畜牧业基地等。要做到这些，如果说在小农经济基础上是不可能的，那么随着农业合作化的发展，它就会日益成为完全可能的了。
    应当看到，不仅一个农业合作社由于土地连片经营，可以进行合理轮作及其他改进技术的措施等，就是在一个地区甚至在全国范围内也日益产生了便利条件，来逐步进行若干农作物分布状况的调整。目前我国同一作物的平均单位面积产量在各个地区之间时常存在着很大的差别。如果加以认真研究和具体分析，并切实采取有效的措施，则会是有利于提高农业生产的。这里可以举出一个明显的例证：浙江省去年把某些分散的棉田比较集中地在慈谿县播种52万亩，以便集中地进行技术指导，结果在这样大面积上获得平均每亩80斤皮棉的产量。无须证明，这只有在一定的农业合作化的基础上才有可能实现。全国现有棉花播种面积8，000多万亩，平均每亩产皮棉31斤多。新疆军垦农场经营棉田比较集中，并采取了若干新的技术措施，去年在8万亩大面积上获得平均每亩140斤皮棉的产量。而全国各地约有1，200万亩极为分散的棉田，由于耕作技术的落后，平均每亩仅产皮棉15斤左右。由此可见，在农业合作化的基础上，逐步地对现有作物的分布加以适当调整，有组织有计划地建立若干技术作物的基地，集中地加强技术指导，以便保证获得高额而稳定的产量，这不仅是必要的而且也是可能的。此外随着农业合作化的发展，山区生产的规划，热带和亚热带生产的规划，都已日益具备了有利的条件。只要我们能够切实采取具体措施，就会不断地在各个方面发挥农业生产的潜在力量。四
    我国对农业进行社会主义改造的任务有两个方面：一方面是改造现有的生产关系，把小农引向合作化的道路，另一方面是改造现有的农业技术装备，把落后的生产工具代之以农业机器。我们发展农业合作化，也是为实现农业机械化准备条件。
    目前我国正在着手兴建第一个拖拉机制造厂，并积极筹建第二个和第三个拖拉机制造厂。一旦这些工厂建成并投入生产，就会年产数万台以至十数万台拖拉机。为了坚定不移地实现大规模的社会主义的机械化农业，就必须在农业合作化运动过程中，逐步克服小农的资本主义的自发倾向，改造他们的自私心理和散漫习惯，耐心地帮助他们培养集体劳动精神，不断积累经营管理的经验，并训练各种领导骨干和积极分子。同时还要把农业合作社逐步由小型发展到大型，由低级发展到高级。只有进行这一系列思想上组织上的艰苦工作，才能为实现大规模的社会主义的机械化农业准备必要的条件。
    无须证明，农业合作化加上农业机械化，将标志着我国农业生产力的空前提高。为此目的，国民经济的两个主要部门——工业和农业必须互相适应、互相支援。一方面农业要向工业供应丰富的商品粮食和工业原料，另一方面工业要向农业供应充足的日用品和生产资料（特别是新的技术装备）。这就是巩固工农联盟的物质基础。国家社会主义工业化和农业技术改造的实现，就可以保证社会主义在我国的完全胜利，就会使社会生产在高度技术基础上获得不断提高，以满足广大人民日益增长的物质的文化的需要。
    半年来，在克服了农业方面的右倾保守思想之后，我国农村就出现了社会主义改造的新高潮，几千万户农民加入了半社会主义性质的合作社。随着农业合作化的迅速进展，手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，也正在突破原来计划的指标向前猛进。而这些方面的社会主义改造的重大胜利，又给我们提供了加快社会主义工业化速度的有利条件。我们早先所需要解决的商品粮食和工业原料问题，工业化资金积累问题，工业的市场问题，工业更有计划地发展问题等等，都将得到更好的解决。在这种形势下，我国自然不应该再拘守原来的工业化规模和速度，而是要适当地把它扩大和加速了。必须适当扩大和加速社会主义工业化的规模和速度，才能保证我国国民经济两大部门——工业和农业向着社会主义道路迅速推进，才能促使社会主义建设事业提早完成。
