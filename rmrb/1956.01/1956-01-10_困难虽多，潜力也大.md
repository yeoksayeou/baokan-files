The 16 member households of the Xinjian Shankang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanjiang District, Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, are all poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants, and they face many production difficulties. When the cooperative formulated its production plan for this year, it calculated that a total of 700 yuan of production funds would be needed, while the share funds that the members could pay were only 158 yuan. Due to the financial difficulties, some members hoped for state loans, or lost confidence in running the cooperative. Later, the Party branch led them to, on the one hand, appropriately reduce the use of commercial fertilizers and accumulate more compost to save expenses; on the other hand, while carrying out winter production, allocate manpower to engage in sideline occupations to increase income. In this way, the funding problem could be solved with a little assistance from the state.

In the case of a large number of poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants joining the cooperative, some leading cadres and members of agricultural cooperatives have developed the idea of relying on state loans to solve the problem of production funds. Judging from the facts of the Shankang cooperative, as long as agricultural cooperatives implement the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, they can rely on their own strength to solve the funding problem.

    困难虽多，潜力也大
    湖南省平江县南江区新建山墈农业生产合作社的16户社员都是贫农和新、老下中农，生产困难较多。这个社在制定今年的生产计划的时候，计算出共需生产资金700元，而社员能缴纳的股份基金只有158元。由于资金困难，有些社员就希望国家贷款，或对办社失去了信心。后来党支部领导他们一方面适当减少商品肥料，多积土粪，节约开支；一方面在进行冬季生产的同时，抽出人力来经营副业，增加收入。这样，只要国家稍加援助，资金问题就解决了。
    在贫农和新、老下中农大量入社的情况下，有些农业合作社的领导骨干和社员在解决生产资金问题方面产生了依赖国家贷款的思想，从山墈社的事实看来，农业合作社只要执行勤俭办社的方针，是可以依靠自己的力量解决资金问题的。
