    Let Farmers Read Newspapers and Periodicals
    With the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, more and more people in rural areas are subscribing to newspapers and periodicals. In December 1955, the circulation of the Jiangsu Peasant Newspaper in counties such as Dantu and Kunshan in Jiangsu Province had increased to more than three times what it was three months earlier. Not only is the circulation of farmers' newspapers rapidly increasing, but the circulation of other publications in rural areas is also rapidly increasing. According to recent statistics from Jiangsu Province, the total number of copies of various newspapers and periodicals issued in the province has increased by approximately 300,000. Postal workers responsible for distributing newspapers and periodicals to the countryside are warmly welcomed by the farmers. Many agricultural cooperatives in Yixing, Gaochun, and Jinshan counties in Jiangsu Province have prepaid their newspaper fees for more than half a year to the post office. Township cadres in Gaochun County said: The newspapers contain the Party's guidelines and policies for all kinds of work. Having them is like having a compass for the farmers, enabling them to move forward more clearly along the road of socialism.
    Based on this situation, those working in newspaper and periodical distribution should promptly send newspapers and periodicals suitable for farmers' needs to the countryside, so that the vast number of farmers can read them.

    让农民能看到报刊
    农业生产合作社发展了，农村订阅报刊的人也越来越多了。1955年12月，江苏农民报在江苏丹徒、昆山等县发行份数已增长到三个月以前的三倍以上。不仅农民报纸的发行数在迅速上升，其他各种刊物在农村的发行数也在迅速增长。据江苏省最近统计，各种报刊在全省共增加期发数约30万份左右。负责发行报刊的邮局工作人员下乡，受到农民群众热烈欢迎。江苏宜兴、高淳、金山等县许多农业合作社都向邮局预付了半年以上的报费。高淳县的乡干部说：报纸上有党对各项工作的方针、政策，农民有了它，就像有了指南针，就能更明确地沿着社会主义道路前进。
    根据这个情况，报刊发行工作者应该迅速把适合农民需要的报刊送到农村去，使广大农民看到报刊。
