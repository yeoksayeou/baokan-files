    Tianjin Tractor Factory Established

    On December 31, 1955, the Tianjin Tractor Factory, formed by the merger and reorganization of the state-owned Tianjin Automobile Parts Manufacturing Factory and the joint state-private Demonstrative Machinery Factory, was formally established. This factory will produce its first batch of light-duty tractors in 1957.

    After the merger and reorganization of these two factories into a tractor manufacturing factory, the existing factory buildings, equipment, and personnel will be fully utilized. Some tractor components will be produced in collaboration with industrial enterprises in more than ten regions, including Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Shenyang.

    To speed up the reconstruction work, the national design department sent a large number of designers to the site to collect design data and carry out preliminary design. Some of the preparatory reconstruction staff also consulted with factories and enterprises in Tianjin, Beijing, and other places on the issue of collaborative production.

    天津拖拉机制造厂成立
    1955年12月31日，由国营天津汽车制配厂和公私合营示范机器厂合并改组成的天津拖拉机制造厂正式成立。这个工厂将在1957年度出产第一批轻型拖拉机。
    这两个厂合并改组为拖拉机制造厂以后，现有的厂房、设备和人员将充分得到利用，部分拖拉机部件将和天津、北京、上海、武汉、沈阳等十多个地区的工业企业组织协作生产。
    为使改建工作加快进行，国家设计部门曾派出大批设计人员来到现场搜集设计资料和进行初步设计。部分筹备改建的工作人员还同天津、北京等地的工厂企业商洽了协作生产的问题。　（据新华社讯）
