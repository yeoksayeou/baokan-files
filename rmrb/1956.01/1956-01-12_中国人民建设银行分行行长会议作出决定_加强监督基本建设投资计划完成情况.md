    China Construction Bank Branch Heads' Meeting Decides to Strengthen Supervision of Basic Construction Investment Plan Completion
    In 1956, the China Construction Bank will strengthen its supervision and inspection of the completion of basic construction investment plans, encourage the acceleration of project progress, and promote the early completion of basic construction plans in the First Five-Year Plan. This was determined at the Third Branch Heads' Meeting of the China Construction Bank, which closed on the 6th.
    The meeting determined that construction units that complete the national plan ahead of schedule may be allocated budget funds earlier or granted incentive short-term loans, as stipulated. Units that do not complete the plan well should be exposed and supervised to improve in a timely manner. While supervising the completion of the basic construction plan, it is also necessary to supervise the economical use of funds. This requires: resolute struggle against actions that do not follow construction procedures and arbitrarily waste state funds; timely review of basic construction budgets received, resolutely eliminating inflated portions exceeding state quotas; urging construction units to fully utilize internal resources, promptly dispose of stockpiled materials exceeding quotas, and supervise construction units to rationally use various working funds within quotas. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen the settlement of project payments to ensure that state allocations are strictly paid according to the actual progress of the project. At the same time, it is necessary to urge construction units and construction and installation enterprises to promptly turn over various payable amounts, to ensure fiscal revenue and increase the internal accumulation of basic construction funds.

    中国人民建设银行分行行长会议作出决定
    加强监督基本建设投资计划完成情况
    在1956年内，中国人民建设银行将加强对基本建设投资计划完成情况的监督和检查，鼓励加快工程进度，促使提前完成第一个五年计划中的基本建设计划。这是6日闭幕的中国人民建设银行第三次分行行长会议确定的。
    这次会议确定，对提早完成国家计划的建设单位，可以按照规定提早拨给预算拨款，或贷给奖励性的短期放款；对完成计划不好的单位，加以揭发，并且监督它们及时改进。在监督完成基本建设计划的同时，还要监督资金的节约使用。这就要求：对不按建设程序办事、任意浪费国家资金的行为，要展开严肃的斗争；要及时审查收到的基本建设预算，坚决剔除超过国家定额的高估部分；要督促建设单位充分利用内部资源，及时处理超定额储备的积压器材，监督建设单位在定额范围内合理地运用各项流动资金。此外，还要加强工程价款的结算工作，保证国家拨款严格按照工程的实际进度支付。同时要督促建设单位和建筑安装企业及时上缴各种应缴款项，以保证财政收入，增加基本建设资金的内部积累。
