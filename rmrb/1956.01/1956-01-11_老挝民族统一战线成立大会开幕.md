Souphanouvong emphasized that the new Lao National United Front will unite the people of the whole country to fight resolutely, demand that the Royal Government thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords, realize the peace, independence, democracy and unity of Laos, smash all conspiracies of the United States and pro-American elements to undermine the Geneva Accords, and strive to safeguard peace in Indochina, Asia and the world.
