    Overcoming Conservative Thought, Striving to Complete the Five-Year Production Increase Target in Four Years
    —A Record of the Second Congress of the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee—
    By Our Correspondent Xiao Yan
    From December 25, 1955, to January 2, 1956, the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee convened its Second Congress.
    The conference discussed the issue of accelerating agricultural collectivization, planning that by the spring of 1956, semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives would encompass over 85% of the province's total farm households, and organizing several batches of elementary cooperatives to transition into advanced cooperatives. The conference discussed the planning issue of striving to overfulfill the five-year agricultural production increase target in four years. The conference also discussed how to strive to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the targets of the nation's First Five-Year Plan within this year, and accelerate socialist construction and the socialist transformation cause in all aspects. The CPC Shandong Provincial Committee also presented preliminary opinions to the conference on formulating a long-term plan for the next seven to twelve years.
    The delegates attending the conference unanimously criticized the various right-leaning conservative thoughts that emerged in the great leap forward towards socialism. For example, some people took a negative attitude towards any production reform, using the excuse of "taking care of the characteristics of the small-peasant economy"; regarding the advanced experiences of the masses, they refused to summarize and promote them, using excuses such as "different conditions, poor foundation, and the masses are not accustomed to it"; some set very low production increase targets, adopting a particularly slow crawling speed; some were only satisfied with issuing general instructions according to the season, fighting drought when there was drought, and fighting flood when there was flood, without planning to lead production in a planned way and without long-term plans. The reason why these right-leaning conservative thoughts arose is that these people did not see the tremendous changes in the rural economic base. This is essentially a denial of the Party's leadership role in agricultural production and a denial of the high production enthusiasm of the broad masses.
    Many examples listed in the conference speeches show that without overcoming right-leaning conservative thought, it is impossible to implement the policy of "overall planning, strengthening leadership." For example, when the province began to compile the 1956 provincial grain production plan, the provincial planning department thought that the figure of 27.9 billion catties proposed by various places was too high, and only compiled it as 27.5 billion catties. However, after criticizing conservative thought, everyone was full of confidence in the task of completing 30 billion catties of grain this year (an increase of 13% over 1955) proposed by the Provincial Committee, and the plans of various places exceeded the provincial target by a large margin. The CPC Linshu County Committee originally planned to drill 2,000 wells throughout the year, but after three or four revisions, it was revised to 17,000 wells, and in fact 13,000 wells have already been drilled. When the Dezhou Prefectural Committee planned the cotton production target for 1956, it had set a backward target of 38 catties of unginned cotton per mu. This was even 2 catties lower than the actual output of the entire prefecture in 1955 (40 catties per mu). Only after overcoming conservative thought was a plan of 55 catties per mu formulated.
    The delegates pointed out in their speeches that although everyone had studied Comrade Mao Zedong's article "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," their understanding of right-leaning conservative thought in agricultural production was not profound enough. After the provincial party committee held the provincial agricultural production work conference in November 1955, and repeatedly and seriously criticized right-leaning conservative thought, and after the responsible persons of party committees at all levels went deep into the countryside to conduct investigations and research, they had a relatively deep understanding. The process of the CPC Liaocheng Prefectural Committee formulating the 1956 production increase plan is a good example: According to the fact that the whole region had only increased production by 2% per year in the past three years, the Liaocheng Prefectural Committee initially set a target of only 8% increase compared with 1955, and suspected whether it was too high. However, after the responsible comrades of the local committee went to the countryside separately and had in-depth talks with the staff, cooperative directors, and individual farmers of the counties, districts, and villages, and inspected dozens of agricultural producers' cooperatives, they found that the actual rate of production increase of agricultural producers' cooperatives had greatly exceeded the planning of the local committee, and then they realized that their thinking was conservative and set a target of a 50% increase compared with 1955. Many leading members of party committees have also gradually mastered the leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses." The level of the Party's leadership over rural work has also been significantly improved, and it has gradually changed from being an amateur to an expert in leading agricultural production work.
    The many production increase facts constantly discovered in various places powerfully illustrate that as long as production reform measures such as building farmland water conservancy, improving cultivation techniques, changing to high-yield crops, and applying a large amount of fertilizer are implemented, the current average yield can be greatly broken through and a high amount of production increase can be achieved. Throughout the province, there are many examples of grain production doubling, doubling, or even multiplying several times due to changing dry land into irrigated land, implementing winter plowing and deep plowing, and adopting improved varieties. For example, in Huang County, where water conservancy is well developed, two crops a year produce an average of 200 catties of wheat and 500 catties of corn per mu. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the province is 33 catties, but in Gaomi County, due to the improvement of cotton planting technology, the average yield per mu still reached 50 catties of ginned cotton in 1955 under the severe disaster. The Zhang Shirui Cooperative in Jimo County implemented intercropping, interplanting, crop rotation, and replanting, and last year obtained a high income of an average of 527.5 catties of grain and 55.7 yuan worth of vegetables per mu, which exceeded the unit area yield of the province by many times. Precisely in the northwest of Shandong Province, where some people believe that the masses have no habit of raising pigs, the Song Changsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Yanggu County raised pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and the farmland had a large amount of fertilizer, with an average grain yield of 685 catties per mu, which was more than three times higher than the local average yield. Rich production townships have also appeared in the mountainous areas of central and southern Shandong, proving that mountainous areas can also achieve high production increases. These facts powerfully criticize right-leaning conservative thought.
    At this conference, all departments such as industrial construction, transportation, finance and trade, culture, education and science, politics and law, and military affairs also unanimously reviewed the right-leaning conservative thoughts of their departments in their speeches, and put forward plans to change leadership style and improve work. The representative of Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Plant reported that after overcoming right-leaning conservative thought, their plant was preparing to complete the first five-year plan in three years and seven months, which gave great encouragement to all the representatives. The representative of the Provincial Department of Industry also put forward a preliminary plan to vigorously support agricultural collectivization and the agricultural production increase movement. The representatives of the financial and trade departments put forward a new plan to expand the supply of double-wheel double-share plows, waterwheels, etc. in 1956.
    The Second Congress of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee marks that the socialist construction and socialist transformation cause in Shandong Province is accelerating at a great pace.

    克服保守思想，争取四年完成五年增产指标
    ——记中共山东省第二次代表会议——
    本报记者　萧彦
    1955年12月25日到1956年1月2日，中共山东省委召开了第二次代表会议。
    会议讨论了加速农业合作化问题，计划1956年春发展半社会主义农业合作社将达到全省总农户的85％以上，并组织数批初级社转为高级社，会议讨论了争取四年超额完成五年农业增产指标的规划问题。会议还讨论如何争取在今年内全面完成和超额完成国家的第一个五年计划的指标，加速各方面的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的问题。中共山东省委并向会议提出了制定一个今后七年到十二年的长期规划的初步意见。
    参加会议的代表们，一致批判了在向社会主义大踏步前进中出现的各种各样的右倾保守思想。譬如有些人对于任何一项生产改革，都借口“要照顾小农经济的特点”而抱消极态度；对于群众的先进经验，则借口“条件不同、基础不好、群众不习惯”等不去总结推广；有的把增产指标压得很低，采取特别缓慢的爬行速度；有的只满足于按季节发一般指示，旱了忙抗旱，涝了再抗涝，不去有计划地领导生产，没有长期打算。这些右倾保守思想所以产生，是因为这些人没有看到农村经济基础的巨大变化。这实质上是否认了党对农业生产的领导作用，否认了广大群众高涨的生产积极性。
    大会发言中所列举的许多事例说明不克服右倾保守思想，就不可能贯彻执行“全面规划、加强领导”的方针。譬如在开始编制1956年全省粮食生产计划的时候，省的计划部门认为各地提出年产279亿斤的数字高了，只编为275亿斤。可是在批判保守思想后，大家对省委提出的今年要完成300亿斤粮食（比1955年增长13％）的任务也满怀信心，而各地的计划又多超过省的指标。中共临沭县委原订全年打井2，000眼，经过三、四次修改，改订为17，000眼，实际上现在已经打了13，000眼。德州地委在规划1956年棉花产量指标时，曾订过每亩产皮棉38斤的落后指标。它比1955年全专区的实际产量（每亩40斤）还降低了2斤。克服了保守思想后，才订出了每亩产55斤的计划。
    代表们在发言中指出，大家虽然学习了毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的文章，但对农业生产中的右倾保守思想认识还是不深刻的。经过省委1955年11月召开的全省农业生产工作会议，反复地、严肃地批判了右倾保守思想，经过各级党委负责人，深入农村，进行调查研究之后，才有了比较深刻的认识。中共聊城地委制定1956年增产规划的经过，就是一个很好的例子：聊城地委根据全区过去三年，每年增产不过2％的情况，最初只订了比1955年增产8％的指标，并且怀疑是不是提得太高了。可是当地委负责同志分头下乡和各县、区、乡村的工作人员、合作社主任、个体农民进行深入谈话，并考察了几十个农业生产合作社之后，发现农业生产合作社实际增产的速度，已大大超过了地委的规划，这才认识了自己思想保守，订出了比1955年增产50％的指标。许多党委的领导人员还因此逐步掌握了“从群众中来，到群众中去”的领导方法。对领导农业生产工作，也逐步由外行变成了内行，党对农村工作的领导水平有了显著的提高。
    各地不断发现的许多增产事实有力地说明了同样的土地只要经过生产改革措施，如兴办农田水利、改进耕作技术、改种高产作物、大量施肥等，就可以大大突破现在的平均产量，达到高额增产。在全省各地，由于将旱地改为水浇地，实行冬耕、深刨，采用良种等，使粮食增产一倍、二倍甚至数倍的例子多得很。例如水利开展较好的黄县，一年两作，平均每亩小麦产200斤，玉米产500斤。全省棉花每亩平均产皮棉33斤，但是高密县农民由于改进了植棉技术，1955年在严重的灾害侵袭下，每亩平均产量还达到50斤皮棉。即墨县张式瑞合作社实行套种、间种、轮作、复种，去年获得了平均每亩产粮527.5斤和价值55.7元的蔬菜的高额收入，超过了全省的单位面积产量的好多倍。恰恰是在有人认为群众没有养猪习惯的鲁西北地区，阳谷县宋长生农业合作社就养猪积肥，庄稼地因为有了大量的肥料，每亩平均产粮685斤，高出当地平均产量三倍以上。在鲁中南山区也出现了丰产乡，证明山区同样可以达到高额增产。这些事实有力地批判了右倾保守思想。
    在这次会议上，工业建设、交通运输、财经贸易、文教科学、政法、军事等各个部门在发言中也一致检讨了本部门的右倾保守思想，提出了转变领导作风和改进工作的计划。济南第一机床厂的代表，报告他们厂在克服右倾保守思想以后，准备在三年七个月完成第一个五年计划，这给全体代表很大的鼓舞。省工业厅的代表也提出了大力支援农业合作化和农业增产运动的初步规划。财粮贸易部门的代表提出了1956年扩大供应双轮双铧犁、水车等的新计划。
    山东省第二次党代表会议，标志着山东省社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，正在大踏步地加速前进。
