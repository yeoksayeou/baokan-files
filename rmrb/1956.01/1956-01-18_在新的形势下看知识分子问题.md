    Looking at the Intellectuals Issue Under the New Circumstances
    Zhang Wei, Director of the Civil Engineering Department, Tsinghua University

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people overthrew the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and established their own people's regime. After a three-year recovery period, large-scale planned construction began. Now, the development of the socialist construction cause is advancing rapidly, and all aspects are rapidly changing. Patriotic intellectuals live and work in such a great transformation, and their ideological changes are significant. This is true for myself and some comrades I have come into contact with.

    I would like to start with some changes in daily work.

    Recently, in civil engineering, we studied the problem of bamboo utilization. Bamboo is a specialty of China and Asia. It is inexpensive, has good performance, and is produced in large quantities, making it an excellent building material. For more than 2,000 years, the Chinese working people have been using it. But in the past, our architects, engineers, and researchers only thought of using steel, wood, and cement. As for bamboo, after all, it was a "rustic" material. Foreigners did not study it, so we certainly did not bother to study it. But now we have studied it and have made preliminary achievements.

    Judging from the research on bamboo, I deeply realize that if the Chinese people had not become masters of their own affairs, and if the Party had not patiently cultivated and educated us intellectuals in the past few years, it would not have been possible to carry out this kind of meaningful and purposeful scientific research.

    Now, the new situation puts forward new requirements and tasks for us intellectuals. How to enable intellectuals to play a better role in future work is a very important issue. This issue includes two aspects: on the one hand, how intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, can further improve their class consciousness and more consciously join the workers and peasants in the socialist construction of the motherland; on the other hand, to create better conditions so that intellectuals can fully play their initiative. I have the following suggestions regarding scientific research and higher industrial education:

    First, it is necessary to unify the views on scientific research and teaching reform. The teaching reform of higher education has been going on for three and a half years since 1952. What are the requirements for teaching reform in the future? What is the relationship between teaching and scientific research? On these issues, the views of leaders and teachers, and between teachers, are not entirely consistent, and need to be clearly defined according to the specific conditions of each school.

    In the past three years, it was entirely correct for higher education institutions to focus their main efforts on teaching reform. Without these three years of teaching reform, higher education institutions would not be able to train senior construction cadres, and training senior construction cadres is precisely the main task of higher education institutions. Without teaching reform, there can be no foundation for further carrying out scientific research. However, in the past period, we did not pay enough attention to academic research. Now, let me just give a few examples of libraries. The library of our school is a very good one among higher education institutions. The reading room is large, and there are many bookshelves where open-shelf reference manuals and books can be placed. But now, except for a few translated textbooks scattered around, the rows of bookshelves are empty. In the past, complete sets of specialized scientific manuals from foreign countries were all kept in the stacks, and students could not refer to them casually, while the Soviet manuals of this kind that we bought were not too many in quantity and were not displayed. It is said that this is done for fear of loss. But we have forgotten to expand the scope of students' knowledge and meet their desire for knowledge, so that in the reading room of our library, in addition to providing students with tables and chairs to read their own textbooks, it is difficult to make people feel that there is any atmosphere of academic research.

    There are also problems in the management of the Beijing Library and the Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. For example, the Beijing Library packed complete sets of Western magazines into boxes and removed the cards from the catalog, on the grounds that "no one borrows them." When magazines are packed into boxes, it makes it impossible for scientific workers who want to refer to previous literature to borrow them. Removing magazine cards from the catalog is equivalent to putting these magazines into cold storage, never to be seen again. The Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences piled the books donated by the Soviet Academy of Sciences on the shelves without any classification. To find a book, you must start from the first shelf and check to the last shelf. This makes those who want to find books only sigh at the ocean of these tens of thousands of cultural treasures and return disappointed. The time we spend on scientific research is already not much, and if we have to spend time finding reference materials in this way, the waste of time is really worrying and helpless.

    Secondly, it is necessary to solve the problem of too many meetings. Recently, a deputy director of a teaching and research group in our department attended 12 meetings in one week. Generally, he has to attend six or seven meetings a week, spending about ten hours a week just attending meetings. The leadership must work hard to solve the problem of too many meetings. Too many meetings not only take up too much time, but also divide the time into fragmented pieces, making it difficult to delve into problems. Teaching preparation work should have at least two or three hours of continuous time, and scientific research work needs even longer continuous time, especially experimental work. Without the necessary time, without continuous time, it is difficult to carry out scientific research work.

    In addition to attending too many meetings, the frequent visits from industrial departments also have a certain impact on the quiet pursuit of work for teachers in higher education institutions. It would be better if everyone contacted each other in advance and raised the questions first.

    Thirdly, there is the issue of cultivating new forces. At present, the strength of higher education and scientific research in our country is still very weak. The tasks put forward to us by the country's socialist construction are far from being accomplished by the existing manpower; it is necessary to accelerate the improvement of the scientific level of the existing personnel and train more new researchers. However, at present, most professors do not have graduate students, which shows that our work arrangements are still very problematic.

    Many young lecturers and teaching assistants in higher education institutions must also engage in scientific research work. There are about 7,500 professors and associate professors in higher education institutions across the country. If half of them study a topic every two years, and these people guide a graduate student or lecturer and teaching assistant to write a thesis every two years, then we can have thousands of papers every year. These papers can play a certain role in construction.

    As an intellectual of the new China, I feel extremely honored and excited. The Party's education and cultivation have made me realize the great significance of my work, and realize that my work is completely consistent with the Party's cause. The more I realize the beautiful future of our country's socialist cause, the more confident and powerful I am in my work. Therefore, I am willing to contribute all my strength to the Party and the people in this great, epoch-making socialist construction cause. It is precisely because of this that I have put forward my views and opinions on the above issues for discussion with everyone.

    在新的形势下看知识分子问题
    清华大学土木工程系主任　张维
    在中国共产党的领导下，中国人民推翻了蒋介石卖国集团的反动统治，建立了人民自己的政权。经过三年的恢复时期，大规模的有计划的建设开始了。现在社会主义建设事业的发展正一日千里，各方面在迅速地改观。爱国的知识分子生活和工作在这样伟大的变革中，思想上的变化是很大的。我自己以及我所接触到的一些同志全是如此。
    我想从日常工作方面的一些变化谈起。
    最近在土木工程方面，我们研究了竹材利用的问题。竹材是我国的也是亚洲的特产，它价廉，性能好，产量大，是优良的建筑材料。2，000多年以来，我国劳动人民一直在使用它。但过去我们的建筑师、工程师们和研究工作者们只想到使用钢、木材和水泥，至于竹材，毕竟它是个“土头土脑”的材料，外国人都不研究，我们当然也不屑于研究了。可是现在我们研究了它，并且有了初步的成绩。
    从竹材研究这一件事来看，我深深地体会到，如果不是中国人民自己当了家，如果不是党在这几年当中对我们知识分子进行了耐心的培养和教育，开展这类有意义、有目的的科学研究是不可能的。
    现在，新的形势向我们知识分子提出新的要求和任务，怎样使知识分子在今后的工作中更好地发挥作用，是很重要的一个问题。这个问题包括两方面：一方面是知识分子特别是高级知识分子如何进一步地提高阶级觉悟，更自觉地同工人、农民一起投身到祖国的社会主义建设事业中来；另一方面是要创造更好的条件，使知识分子能够充分发挥积极性。我想到有下列几点关于科学研究以及高等工业教育方面的意见：
    首先要统一对于科学研究及教学改革的看法。高等学校的教学改革从1952年起已经三年半。今后教学改革的要求是什么？教学和科学研究有什么关系？在这些问题上，领导者和教师、教师和教师之间，看法并不完全一致，有待于按照各校的具体情况，加以明确规定。
    过去三年，高等学校把主要力量放在教学改革上是完全正确的。没有这三年的教学改革，高等学校就不可能培养高级的建设干部，而培养高级的建设干部正是高等学校的主要任务。没有教学改革，也不能有进一步开展科学研究的基础。但是，在过去的一段时间里，我们对学术研究也确实注意得不够。现在只举几个图书馆的例子。我们学校的图书馆在高等学校里是很好的一个。阅览室很大，有很多书架可以放置开架的参考手册和书籍。但现在除了零零星星地放了一些译本的教科书以外，成排的书架空空如也。过去有的外国的成套的专门科学手册全都保存在书库里，学生不能随便参考，而我们所买到的苏联的这类手册，数量既不太多，也并没有陈列出来。据说这样做是因为怕遗失。但我们却忘记了扩大学生的知识范围，满足他们的求知的要求，以致在我们的图书馆的阅览室里，除了供给学生桌椅来看自己的教科书以外，很难使人感到有什么学术研究的气氛。
    北京图书馆和中国科学院的图书馆在管理上也有问题。例如北京图书馆把成套的西文杂志装了箱，把卡片从目录片中抽出，理由是“没有人借”。杂志装了箱，就使想参考以前的文献的科学工作者无法借阅。把杂志卡片从目录卡片中抽出，就等于把这些杂志打入冷宫，永无翻身之日。中国科学院的图书馆把苏联科学院赠送的书籍毫无分类地堆在书架上。要想查书，必须由第一架开始，查到最后一个书架。使查书的人对这上万册的文化宝藏只好望洋兴叹，扫兴而归。我们用在科学研究上的时间本来已经不多，如果再这样地去找参考资料，那时间的浪费，实在使人感到焦急而无可奈何。
    其次是要解决开会过多的问题。近来我们系里的一位教研组副主任某一周开过12次会，一般地每周他也要开六、七次会，光开会大约每周就用去十几小时。这个开会多的问题必须请领导上努力解决。开会多不只是占用了过多的时间，而且也把时间分割成零碎的片段，要深入钻研问题就困难了。教学准备工作至少要有二、三小时的连续时间，科学研究工作需要有更长的连续时间，试验工作尤其是这样。没有必要的时间，没有连续的时间，科学研究工作的开展是很困难的。
    高等学校的教师除了开会多以外，产业部门随时来的参观访问也对于安静地进行工作有一定的影响。如果大家事先联系好，先把问题提出来，那就会好一些。
    再次是培养新生力量的问题。目前我国高等教育和科学研究的力量还非常薄弱。国家的社会主义建设向我们提出的任务远非现有的人力所能完成；必须加速提高现有人员的科学水平，并且培养更多的新的研究人员。但目前一般的教授全没有带研究生，这说明我们的工作安排还很成问题。
    高等学校的许多年轻讲师、助教也必须进行科学研究工作。全国高等学校有教授副教授约7，500人。如果其中一半每两年研究一个题目，这些人又每两年指导一个研究生或讲师、助教做学位论文，那我们每年就可以有几千篇论文。这些论文对于建设可以起一定的作用。
    作为新中国的一个知识分子，我感到无比的光荣和兴奋。党的教育和培养使我认识到自己工作的巨大意义，认识到自己的工作同党的事业的完全一致。愈是认识到了我国社会主义事业的美好前途，我在工作中就更加有信心有力量。因此，我愿意在这个伟大的、划时代的社会主义建设事业中拿出自己的一切力量，贡献给党，贡献给人民。也正是因为这样，我才把自己对以上一些问题的看法和意见提出来，同大家商榷。
