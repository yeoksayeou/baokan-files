    Gansu State-Owned Coal Mines
    Strive to Complete Five-Year Plan Half a Year Ahead of Schedule
    State-owned coal mines in Gansu Province are actively taking measures to strive to complete the first Five-Year Plan half a year ahead of schedule. The average daily output of the Shimen’gou Coal Mine in January this year increased by 19% compared with the average of the same period last year. Tianzhu Coal Mine completed 65.7% of the entire month’s production plan in the first half of January this year.
    Currently, all coal mines are comprehensively promoting various advanced experiences. In terms of production management, the Soviet leadership cadre duty system, work meetings, and dispatching work system have been implemented. Regarding coal mining methods, advanced experiences such as full-height mining in one pass, wooden plank false roofs, and metal mesh false roofs are being continuously promoted. In addition, the mines will establish youth tunneling shock brigades to promote the advanced rapid tunneling experiences of Cui Guoshan, Li Baoshu, and Ma Liu Hai.
    The Gansu Mining Bureau is taking various measures to accelerate the basic construction of coal mines. Recently, in addition to establishing new self-operated construction teams, it has also expanded the original construction teams. Basic construction workers at the coal mines are now working day and night to speed up construction, and the efficiency of shaft sinking has increased by 30% compared to last year. In this way, the two pairs of mine shafts in Agan Town and Shimen’gou Mine that began reconstruction last year can be completed and put into production this year. One of the two pairs of new mine shafts that began construction last year at the Shandan Coal Mine will also be put into production this year.

    甘肃各国营煤矿
    争取提前半年完成五年计划
    甘肃省各国营煤矿正在积极采取措施，争取提前半年完成第一个五年计划。石门沟煤矿今年1月份的平均日产量比去年同期平均增加19％；天祝煤矿今年1月上半月完成全月生产计划65.7％。
    现在，各煤矿正在全面推广各种先进经验。在生产管理方面，推行了苏联的领导干部值班制、作业会议和调度工作制度。在采煤方法上，正在继续推广一次采全高、木板假顶和金属网假顶等先进经验。另外，各矿将要成立青年掘进突击队，推广崔国山、李宝书和马六孩的快速掘进先进经验。
    甘肃矿务局正在采取各种措施加速煤矿的基本建设。最近，除了成立新的自营工程队以外，还扩大了原有的工程队。煤矿基本建设工人现在正在日日夜夜加紧施工，井筒掘进效率比去年提高了30％。这样，阿干镇和石门沟两矿去年开始改建的两对矿井，就可在今年完工投入生产。山丹煤矿去年开始新建立的两对矿井，有一对井也要在今年投入生产。
