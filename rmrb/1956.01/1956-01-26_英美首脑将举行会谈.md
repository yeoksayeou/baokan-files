Xinhua News Agency, January 25th, London Dispatch: British Prime Minister Anthony Eden left London late on January 24th for Washington to hold talks with U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. These talks are being held at Eden's suggestion. As can be seen from the comments in the British newspapers, these talks signify that Western countries, due to the failure of the policies they have implemented, are having to seek new ways to preserve their already shaken position.

According to various reports, the Washington talks will focus on the situation in the Middle East, while also discussing the situation in the Far East and trade embargoes.

Regarding Dulles's recent remarks threatening the Chinese people with hydrogen bomb warfare, the "Daily Mirror" believes that "it is not known whether it will frighten his (referring to Dulles) enemies, but it undoubtedly frightens his friends to death." This newspaper calls on Eden to use "diplomatic skills" to indicate to Dulles that his remarks have caused adverse public opinion reactions abroad.

In the British House of Commons meeting a few hours before Eden left for the United States, former Labor government Trade Minister Wilson asked Eden to raise the issue of lifting the trade embargo against China during the Washington talks.

In addition, there are reports that the Washington talks will also discuss the situation in Europe after the Geneva Four-Power Summit and the Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

Many British newspapers expressed concern that the Washington talks would not be a meeting between two equal partners. The "Daily Mirror" pointed out that Eden would encounter difficulties in Washington.

    英美首脑将举行会谈
    据新华社25日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相艾登已经在1月24日深夜离开伦敦前往华盛顿，同美国总统艾森豪威尔举行会谈。这次会谈是在艾登建议下举行的。从英国报纸的言论中可以看出，这次会谈意味着西方国家由于所实行的政策的失败，不得不寻找新的方法来保全自己已经动摇了的地位。
    据各方面的报道，华盛顿会谈将着重讨论中东地区的局势问题，同时还将讨论到远东局势和贸易禁运等问题。
    对于杜勒斯最近发表的以氢弹战争恫吓中国人民的言论，“每日镜报”认为“它是不是引起他（指杜勒斯）的敌人的惊慌还不知道，但是无疑地是把他的朋友们吓得要死了”。这家报纸要求艾登用“外交手腕”示意杜勒斯，他的讲话在美国国外引起了舆论的不好的反应。
    在艾登动身赴美前几个小时开会的英国下院里，前工党政府贸易大臣威尔逊要求艾登在华盛顿会谈中提出解除对中国的贸易禁运问题。
    此外，也有消息说，华盛顿会谈还将讨论到日内瓦四国首脑会议和四国外交部长会议后的欧洲局势等问题。
    许多英国报纸表示担心，华盛顿会谈将不是两个平等的伙伴间的会谈，“每日镜报”指出，艾登在华盛顿将会遇到困难。
