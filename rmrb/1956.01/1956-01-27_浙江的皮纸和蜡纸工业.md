Zhejiang Province's bark paper and wax paper industry is a relatively unique part of China's papermaking industry. Its raw materials are Goose Tree bark, Daphne bark, Paper Mulberry bark, Mulberry tree, and Kozo bark.

The characteristics of bark paper are that it is tough and wear-resistant, thin, and has high air permeability. There are many types of bark paper and a wide range of uses. It can be soaked in brine to incubate silkworm eggs, used to paste windows, make umbrellas, line batteries, and be used as industrial paper for mining, printing, communications, and electrical machinery. Utilizing bark paper's wax paper base and white cotton paper for coating processes turns it into wax paper for cultural purposes.

Before liberation, the bark paper and wax paper industry was not valued. Under the ravages of malignant inflation, it was on its last breath by the eve of liberation. After liberation, the People's Government first financially supported the factories to resume production, and then strengthened its leadership. The bark paper and wax paper industry took on a new look, and production increased rapidly.

In the past few years, workers have greatly utilized collective wisdom and strength in the production process of bark paper and wax paper. For example, they created a chemical degumming method for mountain cotton bark, replacing manual peeling, which increased labor productivity by 47% and increased raw material harvest rate by 10%. They created paper machines and papermaking tools, which reduced the labor intensity of workers and eliminated occupational diseases. Thanks to the creative labor of the workers, the quality of bark paper and wax paper has also improved significantly.

Zhejiang's bark paper and wax paper also have a certain status internationally. Currently, stencil wax paper, typing wax paper, and white cotton paper have been exported to the German Democratic Republic, the Mongolian People's Republic, Vietnam, and Korea. With the gradual development of China's industry, agriculture, and cultural undertakings, the bark paper and wax paper industry will inevitably develop further. (Jin Zhuxian)

    浙江的皮纸和蜡纸工业
    浙江省的皮纸、蜡纸工业是我国造纸工业中比较独特的一部分。它的原料是雁树皮、结香皮、构树皮、桑树、楮皮等。
    皮纸的特性是坚韧耐磨、薄而透气度大。皮纸的种类多，用途也广，可以浸渍盐卤孵化蚕种，裱糊窗子，做雨伞、衬电池和作采矿、印刷、通讯、电机等工业用纸。利用皮纸中的蜡纸原纸和白棉纸加工涂料便成了文化方面用的蜡纸。
    解放前，皮纸、蜡纸工业是不被人重视的，在恶性通货膨胀的摧残下，至解放前夕已经奄奄一息。解放后，人民政府先从经济上扶助各厂恢复生产，随后又加强了对它的领导，皮纸、蜡纸工业出现了新的面貌，产量飞速增长。
    几年来，工人们在皮纸、蜡纸的生产过程中，大大发挥了集体智慧和力量，如创造了山棉皮化学脱胶法，代替手工刨皮，提高了劳动生产率47％，增加原料的收获率10％。创造了抄纸机和抄纸工具，降低了工人的劳动强度，消除了职业病。由于工人们的创造性的劳动，皮纸和蜡纸的质量也有显著的提高。
    浙江的皮纸、蜡纸在国际上也有一定地位。现在，誊写蜡纸、打字蜡纸和白棉纸已经出口到民主德国、蒙古人民共和国、越南和朝鲜。随着我国工业、农业和文化事业的逐步发展，皮纸、蜡纸工业也必将进一步发展。（金主宪）
