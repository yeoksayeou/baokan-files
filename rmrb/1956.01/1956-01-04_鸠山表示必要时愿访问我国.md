Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 3rd: According to a report in the "Asahi Shimbun" on the 3rd, Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama said that if necessary, he would be willing to come to China to normalize relations between Japan and China.

Hatoyama made this statement at a symposium held by the "Asahi Shimbun" with him and the chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, Mozaburo Suzuki. At the meeting, Suzuki stated that Japan should develop formal relations with China and urged Ichiro Hatoyama to visit China.

Hatoyama said: "I agree with Mr. Suzuki's statement: Because Communist China is our neighbor, we should establish close relations with that country." He also said: "I do not avoid meeting with Mao Zedong or Zhou Enlai. If it is necessary for me to go to Communist China, I am willing to go. In any case, I do believe that our relations with that country will gradually become closer."

Hatoyama also talked about Japan's relations with the Soviet Union, saying: "We should end our state of war with the Soviet Union. And I hope to achieve this goal as soon as possible this year."

　　鸠山表示必要时愿访问我国
　　新华社3日讯　东京消息：据“朝日新闻”3日报道，日本首相鸠山一郎说，如果必要的话，他愿意到中国来使日、中两国的关系正常化。
    鸠山的这个谈话是在“朝日新闻”社主持举行的一次他和日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎两人的座谈会上发表的。会上，铃木曾经表示日本应该同中国发展正式的关系，并且敦促鸠山一郎到中国访问。
    鸠山说：“我同意铃木先生的这种说法：因为共产党中国是我们的邻居，我们应该同那个国家建立密切的关系。”他并且说：“我并不避免同毛泽东或周恩来会谈。如果我有必要到共产党中国的话，我是愿意去的。无论如何，我的确认为我们同那个国家的关系将日渐更加密切。”
    鸠山还谈到日本同苏联的关系，他说：“我们应当结束我们同苏联的战争状态。并且我希望今年尽早达到这个目的。”
