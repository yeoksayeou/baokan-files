Taking Basic Measures to Solve "Old Problems"
Kong Sang

The Pinggui Shuiyanba Tin Mine in Guangxi relies on hydropower for its extraction. The local rainfall is scarce in winter, and the water source is insufficient. Every year, the mine rushes to prevent drought in the autumn. However, despite annual drought prevention efforts, production is always affected by insufficient water sources in the end. People at the mine believe that water shortage is a difficulty brought to the mine's production by nature, and it's not bad enough if they can find a way to alleviate it.

It seems that Pinggui Shuiyanba Tin Mine cannot be said to be passive in dealing with the problem of water shortage. If there is a water shortage, one should prevent drought. Isn't that fulfilling one's responsibility? However, after the Soviet experts arrived at the Shuiyanba Tin Mine, they asked some very ordinary questions. He asked: What is the pattern of change in the water source here? How much water is needed for production? How much water is still lacking? What are the plans to solve it? The comrades at the mine couldn't answer any of them. A mine that relies on hydropower for extraction, without understanding the basic situation of water sources and production water usage, as well as the laws of other changes, and without considering what basic measures to take to solve this fundamental problem, how can it be said that it has fulfilled its leadership responsibilities? The Soviet expert later suggested building a reservoir to store a large amount of water during the rainy season in summer and early autumn for use in the water-scarce winter. The mine studied the local rainfall changes and topographic conditions and believed that this suggestion was completely correct. This fundamental old problem was thus solved.

"Old problems" like the water shortage at Shuiyanba Tin Mine also exist in other enterprises. For example, in the coal mine system, the geological work lags behind the requirements of tunneling and coal mining, and tunneling lags behind daily mining, resulting in "overspending," etc., are all so-called "old problems." Many comrades often take a "lazy" attitude towards these "old problems," grasping them for a while when they think of them, and setting them aside when they are busy. If you say that they have no understanding of these problems, they often talk about them; if you say that they are very determined to solve "old problems," you can't see any measures or effects. Over time, they become accustomed to it, and it seems that they are not surprised by the strangeness, and the strangeness can truly defeat itself. In this way, not only can the production level of the enterprise not be improved, but also a conservative work style is developed.

"Old problems" are often fundamental problems, and they are also problems that should and can be solved. All departments and enterprises should bring out these "old problems," criticize conservative ideas, overcome inertia, formulate basic measures, thoroughly solve these "old problems," and improve the production level of the enterprise by one step.

    采取基本措施解决“老问题”
    孔桑
    广西平桂水岩坝锡矿是靠水力开采的。当地冬季雨量稀少，水源不足，矿上每年一到秋季就赶快防旱。但是，年年防旱，末了还总要因为水源不足影响一些生产。矿上的人认为，缺水是自然界给矿山生产带来的困难，能设法减轻一些就算不坏了。
    看来，平桂水岩坝锡矿对待缺水的问题不能说是消极的。缺水，就防旱，难道还没有尽到责任吗？可是，苏联专家到了水岩坝锡矿后，提了几个很普通的问题。他问：这里的水源循着什么规律变化？生产上需要多少水？还缺多少水？准备怎样解决？矿上的同志一句也答不上。一个依靠水力开采的矿山，不了解水源和生产用水的基本情况及其他变化的规律，不考虑采取什么基本措施来解决这个根本性的问题，怎么可以说是已经尽到领导的责任呢？苏联专家后来提出可以建设一个蓄水池，在夏季和秋初雨量充沛的时候大量蓄水，以供冬季缺水时候使用。矿山研究了当地的雨量变化和地形条件，认为这个建议是完全正确的。这个根本性的老问题，就这样有了解决的办法。
    类似水岩坝锡矿缺水这样的“老问题”，在其他企业里也是有的。例如在煤矿系统中生产地质工作落后于掘进和采煤的要求，掘进又落后于日采，以致“寅吃卯粮”等等也都是所谓“老问题”，许多同志对待这些“老问题”也常常采取一种“懒洋洋”的态度，想起来时抓一阵，忙的时候就搁下来了。说他们对这些问题没有认识，他们也时常挂在嘴上；说他们解决“老问题”决心很大，却看不见有什么措施和效果。久而久之，就习以为常，似乎见怪不怪其怪真能自败。这样，不但企业的生产水平不能提高，而且养成了保守作风。
    “老问题”常常是一些根本性的问题，也是完全应该和有可能解决的问题。各个部门，各个企业都应该把这些“老问题”端出来，批判保守思想，克服惰性，订出基本措施，彻底解决这些“老问题”，把企业的生产水平提高一步。
