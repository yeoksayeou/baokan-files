    Why Can't We Get Rest All Year Round?
    To the Editor:
    Recently, I went to the Datai residential area of the Jingxi Mining Area in Beijing to understand the work situation, and many comrades reported to me the problem of not being able to rest on Sundays and holidays. Many staff members here have their homes in downtown Beijing or Mentougou; however, if they want to go home on Sundays, they must ask for leave, and it must not exceed fifteen days throughout the year; exceeding that amount will result in salary deductions. The leave application procedures are also very cumbersome, requiring group discussion, leadership approval, and approval from the residential area负责人. Even during the national statutory holidays, the situation is the same.
    Is it because the work is too busy, and there is no time to rest? That is not the case at all. I stayed in Datai for a whole week, and I should say that their work is indeed very busy at times, but at other times the work is not so hectic. Many people are idle during office hours, chatting, reading newspapers, and even playing cards. Someone said, "Although we don't have a vacation system, we do get a lot of rest; because the work is irregular, we end up staying for a whole day." Obviously, as long as the work is properly arranged, cadres can get normal rest, and the work can be done even better. Ren Wen, the newly transferred deputy secretary of the district party committee, said, "When I used to work in a suburban police station, I also couldn't rest on Sundays for a long time. Later, after the work was rationally arranged, I was able to rest." He believes that rationally arranging working hours is a very important issue. The current situation of dragging out work actually has a negative impact on work efficiency and quality.
    So, where is the problem? I think the main problem lies in the ideology of certain leaders. Last year, someone wrote a letter to the Beijing Daily, requesting that they be able to rest on holidays. The CPC Datai residential area committee formulated a vacation plan based on the work situation. However, the Jingxi Mining Area People's Committee believed that the work situation in this area was special, so it cancelled the vacation system. In order to ensure "attendance," the personnel section of the Jingxi Mining Area also required the residential area to report the Sunday leave statistics table on time. Dong Chunqing, deputy director of the residential area office, also believes that people who ask for leave to go home on Sundays are "ideologically backward," "not highly conscious," and even "bad cadres." This is the main reason why the problem has not been resolved for a long time. I think the problems reflected by these comrades should be taken seriously. The leading organs should properly arrange the work according to the different conditions of each region, and ensure that cadres can maintain a normal work and life order!

### 为什么终年得不到休息？

    为什么终年得不到休息？编辑同志：
    最近我到北京市京西矿区大台小区去了解工作，很多同志向我反映他们星期天和例假日得不到休息的问题。这里很多工作人员家在北京市区或者门头沟；但是他们星期日要回家必须请假，并且全年不得超过十五天，超过了就要扣薪金。请假手续又十分繁琐，要经过组内讨论、领导同意、小区负责人批准。就是在国家规定的年节假期，情况也是这样。
    是不是因为工作很忙，没有休息时间呢？完全不是这样。我在大台整整住了一个星期，应该说，他们在有些时候工作的确很忙，但是有些时候工作并不紧张，不少人在办公时间闲着聊天、看报纸，甚至打扑克牌。有人说：“我们虽然没有休假制度，可是也不少休息；因为工作不正规，一呆就是一整天。”显然，只要妥善地安排工作，干部就可以得到正常的休息，工作也能够做到更好。调来不久的区委副书记任文同志就说：“我过去在郊区派出所工作的时候，星期天也是长期不能休息，后来合理安排了工作，就能够休息了。”他认为：合理安排工作时间是个很重要的问题，像目前这样工作拖拖拉拉，工作效率和工作质量反而受到了不好的影响。
    那末，问题在那里呢？我认为，主要是某些领导人员思想有问题。去年曾经有人向北京日报写信，要求例假能够得到休息。中共大台小区区委会根据工作情况制定了一个休假的办法。但是京西矿区人民委员会却认为这个地区的工作情况特殊，就取消了这项休假制度。为了保证“出勤”，京西矿区人事科还要求小区按时上报星期天请假统计表。小区办事处副主任董春顷还认为星期天要请假回家的人是“思想落后”、“觉悟不高”，甚至是“坏干部”。这就是问题长期没有解决的主要原因。我认为，这些同志们反映的问题应该受到重视。领导机关应该根据各个地区的不同情况，妥善地安排工作，保证干部能够保持正常的工作和生活秩序！
