    The socialist agriculture's inexhaustible power
    Our newspaper correspondent in the Soviet Union, Li He
    Soviet collective farmers and agricultural workers, like all the people of the Soviet Union, are joyfully welcoming the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, and are preparing to fully implement the call of the CPSU Central Committee for a large increase in agricultural production—to produce 11 billion poods of grain annually by 1960 (180 million tons). Compared with 1955, cotton and sugar beets will increase by half, flax fiber will increase by 35%, and potatoes, vegetables, meat, milk, eggs, and wool will all increase by nearly or more than double.
    Such a large-scale increase in agricultural production in the next five years will provide the Soviet Union with exceptionally abundant grain and other agricultural products, sufficient to meet the needs of further development in all aspects of people's lives, grain reserves, industrial raw materials, and foreign trade. The great development of agricultural production in the Soviet Union will also create a broader field for the great development of the production of machinery, fertilizers, fuels, building materials, and other industrial products. Therefore, in the new Five-Year Plan, the great development of Soviet agriculture is in line with the great development of Soviet industry and the great development of the Soviet national economy. This means that the worker-peasant alliance, which is the foundation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, will be further consolidated. This means that more sufficient material conditions are being accumulated for the transition to a communist society. 11 billion poods of grain (and many other agricultural products), if averaged over a population of 200 million, would mean that each Soviet citizen would have 900 kilograms (1,800 jin) of grain alone in 1960. This is a huge goal. It reflects the rapid speed of Soviet agricultural development, the strong will of the Soviet people, and the inexhaustible power of socialist agriculture.
    As everyone knows, Russia's grain output in 1913 was about 5 billion poods; after the October Revolution, through agricultural collectivization and mechanization, the Soviet Union's grain output in 1940 increased to 7.2 billion poods; after the war, in 1947, the Soviet Union's grain output almost recovered to the 1940 level; In 1952, the year before the CPSU Central Committee put forward the program for further developing agriculture in September 1953, the Soviet Union's grain output increased to 8 billion poods. From these records, we can conclude: First, in the 20 years from 1913 to 1940, the Soviet Union's grain output increased by more than 2 billion poods. Second, in the six or seven years after the war, the Soviet Union's grain output increased by nearly 1 billion poods. Third, from the time when measures to further develop agriculture began to be implemented in 1954 to 1960, the Soviet Union will increase grain by 3 billion poods in the 7 years. That is to say, as far as increasing the main agricultural product of grain is concerned, the Soviet Union is doing today what it did in the previous 40 years!
    The development of Soviet agriculture, especially the great development in the future, is based on the rapid development of heavy industry. The Soviet Union's steel production in 1960 will be 16.1 times that of 1928 (before the start of the Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan and comprehensive agricultural collectivization). Coal production—16.7 times, electricity—63.9 times. The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates that industry will supply agriculture with approximately 1.65 million tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower per unit), 560,000 grain harvesters, and 250,000 corn harvesters and mowers. The electrification of agricultural production and the overall mechanization of field work, livestock farm work, etc., all have huge plans in the next five years.
    Socialist agriculture has all the possibilities to achieve great development of production. Reclaiming wasteland is an important measure to rapidly increase grain production. The area sown on newly reclaimed land this spring will reach more than 30 million hectares. The main task on the new land in the future is to cultivate well and increase yields. In the future, continued reclamation will be limited to wastelands that do not require large investments and can obtain reliable harvests.
    In the past two years, the large-scale reclamation of wasteland in the Soviet Union has been completed as a national task. Soviet Deputy Minister of State Farms Kozevkov told us at a press conference on the 19th that 350,000 young men and women from all over the Soviet Union responded to the call of the Soviet Communist Party and went to the wasteland. 425 new state farms have been organized in the newly reclaimed areas, each averaging 20,000 to 25,000 hectares of cultivated land. Already in 1954, the Soviet Union had harvested hundreds of millions of poods of grain from the new land.
    On January 20, a meeting of outstanding young members of the Young Pioneers and young people who reclaimed wasteland began in the Kremlin. They will summarize the experience of reclamation and discuss future work. Undoubtedly, the young heroes of the new land will make a significant contribution to the new upsurge in agriculture.
    In addition to strengthening work on the already reclaimed new land, Soviet agricultural workers will also increase unit area yield, expand the planting of high-yield crops such as corn (which will reach more than 28 million hectares by 1960), increase feed bases (not only ensuring sufficient feed for public livestock but also for the private livestock of villagers), further improve the role of tractor stations, increase the labor productivity of villagers, and strengthen the Party's mass political and organizational work in rural areas... etc., continue to strive to utilize all possibilities. This year, we will begin to transform machine tractor stations into economically accountable enterprises; this will enhance the sense of responsibility of machine tractor station leaders for the correct use of materials and agricultural technology.
    The Soviet countryside is now summing up last year's work and preparing to welcome the first spring plowing period of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Soviet socialist agriculture, like the land full of enchanting vitality in spring, contains the infinite power to develop production.

    社会主义农业的无穷力量
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    苏联集体农民和农业工人，和全苏人民一样，欢欣鼓舞地迎接着苏联发展国民经济的第六个五年计划，准备全力实现苏共中央关于农业大增产的号召——到1960年要年产谷物110亿普特（1.8亿吨）。和1955年比较，棉花和甜菜要增加半倍，亚麻纤维要增加35％，马铃薯、蔬菜、肉类、牛奶、鸡蛋、羊毛都要增加近一倍或一倍以上。
    在今后5年中农业方面这样大规模的增产，将使苏联拥有异常丰富的粮食和其他农产品，足以适应人民生活、粮食贮备、工业原料、对外贸易各方面进一步发展的需要。苏联农业生产的大发展，也将为机器、肥料、燃料、建筑材料和其他工业品生产的大发展取得更加广阔的境域。因此，在新的五年计划中，苏联农业的大发展，正是与苏联工业的大发展，与苏联国民经济的大发展相适应的。这意味着作为无产阶级专政基础的工农联盟将更加巩固。这意味着为过渡到共产主义社会积蓄着更加充足的物质条件。110亿普特谷物（和其他许许多多农产品），如果以2亿人口平均，那么每一个苏联人在1960年一年仅谷物一项就将有900公斤（1，800市斤）。这是巨大的目标。它反映着苏联农业发展的飞快速度，反映着苏联人民的坚强意志，反映着社会主义农业的无穷力量。
    大家知道，俄国在1913年谷物产量约为50亿普特；十月革命以后，经过农业集体化和机械化，苏联在1940年谷物产量提高到72亿普特；战后1947年苏联谷物产量差不多恢复到1940年的水平；在1953年9月苏共中央提出进一步发展农业的纲领前一年（1952年），苏联谷物产量提高到80亿普特。从这些记载中，我们可得出：一，由1913年到1940年的20多年中，苏联谷物产量增加20多亿普特。二，战后六、七年中，苏联谷物产量增加近10亿普特。三，从1954年开始实现进一步发展农业的措施时起，到1960年止的7年中，苏联谷物要增加30亿普特。这就是说，单就增产农业主产品谷物来说，苏联今天在做以前40年间所做的事情！
    苏联农业的发展，特别是今后的大发展，是以重工业的迅速发展为基础的。苏联的钢产量在1960年将为1928年（苏联第一个五年计划和农业全盘集体化开始以前）的16.1倍。煤产量——16.7倍，电力——63.9倍，第六个五年计划规定，工业将供给农业大约165万台拖拉机（以每台15匹马力折算），56万台谷物收割机，25万台玉米收割机和割草机。农业生产的电气化和田间工作、养畜场工作等等的全盘机械化，在今后5年中都有巨大的规划。
    社会主义农业具有实现生产大发展的一切可能。开垦荒地是迅速提高谷物产量的一个重要措施。今年春天在开垦的新地上播种的面积将达到3，000万公顷以上。今后在新地上的主要工作是很好耕种和提高收成。今后继续开垦的，只限于那些不需要很大投资和能够得到可靠收成的荒地。
    过去两年苏联大规模开垦荒地，是作为全民任务完成了的。苏联国营农场部副部长科泽夫科夫19日在记者招待会上告诉我们：全苏各地有35万男女青年响应苏联共产党的号召到了荒地。在新开垦的地区组织了425个新的国营农场，每个平均耕地2万到2.5万公顷。还在1954年，苏联从新地上已经收获几亿普特谷物。
    1月20日，在克里姆林宫开始举行开垦荒地的优秀青年团员和青年会议。他们将总结开荒经验，讨论今后工作。无疑的，新地的年青的主人公们将对农业新高涨作出重大贡献。
    除了加强在已开垦的新地上的工作以外，苏联农业劳动者还将在提高单位面积产量，扩种高产量作物玉米（到1960年将达2，800万公顷以上），增加饲料基地（不单对公有牲畜而且对庄员的私有牲畜保证有充足的饲料），进一步提高拖拉机站的作用，提高庄员的劳动生产率，加强党在农村中的群众政治工作和组织工作……等等方面，继续努力利用一切可能性。今年就要开始把机器拖拉机站转为经济核算的企业；这将提高机器拖拉机站领导人员对于正确地使用资料和农业技术的责任心。
    现在苏联农村中正在总结去年工作和准备迎接第六个五年计划时期的第一个春耕。苏联社会主义农业正如春天充满迷人的生命力的土地一样，饱含着发展生产的无穷的力量。
