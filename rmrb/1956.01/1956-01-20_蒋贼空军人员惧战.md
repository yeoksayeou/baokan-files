Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 18th: Wei Dawei, Liang Feng, and Zhai Xiaowu, who defected from Taiwan by flying aircraft, said that under the heavy blows of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force and anti-aircraft fire, the fear of war and war-weariness of Chiang Kai-shek's air force personnel in Taiwan are growing daily.

    Wei Dawei said that in December of last year, a pilot from Chiang Kai-shek's Taoyuan Air Base told him that several jet fighters from their base had been shot down in three days. Wang Fayao, a second lieutenant pilot of the Third Wing of Chiang Kai-shek's air force, once flew an F-84 jet fighter to intrude over the mainland airspace, and the aircraft was hit by more than seventy holes by the People's Liberation Army's anti-aircraft fire. Wang Fayao almost lost his life.

    Wei Dawei and others said that many pilots in Chiang Kai-shek's air force are unwilling to fly fighters and bombers. They fear the skies over the mainland. Some pilots often ask for suspension from flying on the pretext of having "aviation sickness."

    The ground crew in Chiang Kai-shek's air force are even more miserable. They have low wages and a lot of work. Many people are so tired that they get sick, but they can't even support their wives and children. Incidents of suicide by mechanics are constantly occurring in various air force bases of Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan.

    Wei Dawei and others said that although Chiang Kai-shek has implemented various dark rule and methods such as evaluating "heroes," issuing bonuses, and issuing medals in his air force in an attempt to save its air force morale, the pilots said that people value their lives and ghosts want money, and what is the use of that damned iron plate (referring to the medal).

    蒋贼空军人员惧战
    据新华社福州18日电　从台湾驾驶飞机起义归来的韦大卫、梁枫、翟笑梧说，台湾蒋贼空军人员在中国人民解放军空军和高射炮火的沉重打击下，恐惧厌战情绪日益增长。
    韦大卫说，去年12月，蒋贼桃园空军基地的一个飞行员告诉他说，他们基地的喷气战斗机在3天内被打落了好几架。蒋贼空军第三联队少尉飞行员王法尧一次驾驶F—84型喷气战斗机窜扰大陆上空时，飞机被人民解放军高射炮火打了七十多个洞，王法尧差点丧了命。
    韦大卫等说，蒋贼空军中许多飞行员都不愿驾驶战斗机和轰炸机。他们惧怕大陆的天空。有些飞行员常借口有“航空病”要求停飞。
    蒋贼空军中的地勤人员更苦。他们工钱少，工作多，许多人累得生病，可是连老婆孩子的生活都维持不了。机械员自杀的事件，在台湾蒋贼各空军基地不断发生。
    韦大卫等说，蒋贼虽然在其空军中实行了各种黑暗统治和评“英雄”、发奖金、发奖章等办法，企图挽救其空军士气。但是，飞行员们却说，人要命、鬼要钱，要那块该死的铁牌牌（指奖章）又有什么用。
