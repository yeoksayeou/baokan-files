　　State Council Directive on Several Issues Concerning the Establishment of Ethnic Townships

　　In accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, ethnic townships should be established in all minority areas equivalent to a township. All ethnic autonomous regions equivalent to a township that were established in the past should be reorganized into ethnic townships. The relevant issues concerning the establishment of ethnic townships are hereby instructed as follows:

　　I. In minority areas equivalent to a township, the following ethnic townships should be established based on local ethnic relations and conditions conducive to production:

　　(1) Ethnic townships established in areas equivalent to a township where one minority ethnic group resides.

　　(2) Ethnic townships established in areas equivalent to a township where two or more minority ethnic groups reside together.

　　(3) Ethnic townships established in areas equivalent to a township based on minority areas and including some Han Chinese residential areas.

　　II. The names of ethnic townships should generally consist of the ethnic name followed by the local name, except in special circumstances. For example, Anjiapo Dongxiang Ethnic Township in Linxia County; Xielu Hui Ethnic Township in Kangle County.

　　III. Each ethnic group in the People's Congress of the ethnic township should have an appropriate number of representatives.

　　The People's Committee of the ethnic township should be composed mainly of minority personnel.

　　IV. State organs of ethnic townships shall use the common language and script of the local ethnic group when exercising their functions.

　　V. State organs of ethnic townships should pay attention to the characteristics of the local ethnic group when exercising their functions.

　　VI. The establishment of ethnic townships and the reorganization of ethnic autonomous regions equivalent to townships into ethnic townships must be fully consulted with representatives of the local ethnic groups, and thorough publicity should be conducted among the local people to prevent any simplistic and hasty practices.

　　VII. After the establishment of ethnic townships, each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government should report to the State Council for the record along with relevant information.
