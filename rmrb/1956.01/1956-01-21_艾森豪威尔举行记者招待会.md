Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 20th: U.S. President Eisenhower held a press conference in Washington on January 19. This was his first press conference since recovering his health.

　　Reporters repeatedly raised questions to Eisenhower about the article containing Dulles's remarks published in "Life" magazine, which has been widely criticized. In his reply, Eisenhower said he did not intend to discuss the article, and at the same time, he said he had "complete trust in Dulles."

　　One reporter asked Eisenhower for his opinion on Dulles's remarks about the United States needing to go to the brink of war. Eisenhower replied that the United States must be "firm" "every time the situation appears dangerous," and "this can be interpreted as being on the brink of something."

　　In answering questions from reporters, Eisenhower essentially reiterated Dulles's threat to the Chinese people: The United States will use U.S. armed forces to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. A reporter asked Eisenhower whether, as Dulles implied in his interview with "Life" magazine, he had at some point made a decision on "using U.S. armed forces" once the Chinese people liberated Quemoy and Matsu. He said he was unwilling to discuss this issue. Regarding the question of whether he would make this decision when necessary, he said he could not currently answer such a "hypothetical situation."

　　One reporter asked Eisenhower for his opinion on holding another summit meeting. Eisenhower expressed his unwillingness to discuss this issue.

　　Eisenhower read a statement at the press conference, indicating that he did not object to being nominated as a presidential candidate in the current state primaries, but he emphasized that this did not mean he had made any final decision on whether to run for president again.

    艾森豪威尔举行记者招待会
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔1月19日在华盛顿举行记者招待会。这是他在恢复健康以后举行的第一次记者招待会。
    记者们纷纷就受到广泛抨击的“生活”杂志刊载的杜勒斯谈话的文章，向艾森豪威尔提出问题。艾森豪威尔在答复中表示不打算讨论这篇文章，同时他说，他“完全信任杜勒斯”。
    有记者问艾森豪威尔对于杜勒斯谈话里谈到美国应走到战争的边缘的意见。艾森豪威尔回答说，美国要在“每当局势显得危险”的时候“坚定”，“可以把这解释为处于某种事情的边缘”。
    艾森豪威尔在答复记者提出的问题中，实际上重述了杜勒斯对中国人民发出的威胁：美国要使用美国武装部队来阻挠中国人民解放台湾。记者问艾森豪威尔，他是否像杜勒斯对“生活”杂志的谈话中所暗示的那样，曾经在某个时候就一旦中国人民解放金门和马祖时“使用美国武装部队”问题作出过决定，他说，他不愿就此问题进行讨论。对于在必要时他是否作出这个决定的问题，他说，他目前无法答复这种“假定的情况”。
    有记者问艾森豪威尔对于举行另一次最高级会议的意见。艾森豪威尔表示不愿意谈论这个问题。
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上宣读了一篇声明，表示他不反对在目前州的预选中提名他为总统候选人，但是他强调指出，这并不意味着他已作出是否再度竞选总统的任何最后决定。
