Over 210,000 primary and secondary school teachers across the country are participating in spare-time studies.

At present, most large and medium-sized cities across the country have teacher training schools to provide cultural enrichment for primary school teachers who have not reached the level of primary normal school graduates or who have graduated from primary normal school but have not reached the level of secondary normal school graduates. In general counties, cities, and rural areas, there are also correspondence normal schools for primary school teachers. There are now more than 500 spare-time training schools and correspondence normal schools for primary school teachers in the country, with more than 200,000 students enrolled.

In 1950, there was only one secondary school teacher training college, but now the number has increased to 29. More than 8,000 secondary school teachers are participating in the studies. Northeast Normal University, Beijing Normal University, and other higher normal institutions have also established correspondence departments for secondary school teachers in nearby counties, cities, and rural areas.
