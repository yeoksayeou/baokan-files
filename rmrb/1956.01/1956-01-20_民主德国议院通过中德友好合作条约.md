Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 19th - The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, at its first plenary session of the year on the 18th, unanimously approved the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the governments of China and Germany, signed in Beijing on December 25, 1955.

Prime Minister Grotewohl delivered a report to the deputies on the delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic's visit to China, North Korea, and Mongolia. In his report, he emphasized the importance of this visit in strengthening friendly relations between the GDR and the Far Eastern countries. He devoted a large part of his report to his impressions of his visit to China and the significance of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. He said: The Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation opens a new page in the history of relations between the two countries. This treaty is a solid link connecting the westernmost and easternmost countries in the powerful socialist camp. Therefore, it further strengthens and consolidates the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp. His speech was frequently interrupted by thunderous applause.

Following Prime Minister Grotewohl's speech, Horn, a technician from the Dessau Carriage Factory, and Ulf, the director of the "Friendship" Agricultural Production Cooperative, spoke in succession, vividly reporting on their meetings with workers and farmers from China, North Korea, and Mongolia.

After the representative of the Foreign Policy Committee of the People's Chamber reported on the committee's opinions on the Sino-German treaty, the meeting proceeded to a vote. All deputies present solemnly stood up and unanimously supported the treaty. After the vote, the Chairman of the People's Chamber, Dieckmann, said: "We pay tribute to the great Chinese people." The whole audience stood up and applauded warmly.

    民主德国议院通过中德友好合作条约
    新华社柏林19日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院在18日举行的今年度第一次全体会议上，一致通过了1955年12月25日中德两国政府在北京签订的友好合作条约。
    格罗提渥总理向议员们作了关于德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问中、朝、蒙三国的报告。他在报告中强调指出这次访问对于加强民主德国和远东国家间友好关系的重要意义。他在报告中以很大的篇幅谈到访问中国的印象和中德友好合作条约的意义。他说：中德友好合作条约在两国关系史上打开了新的一页。这个条约是一条连结强大的社会主义阵营国家中最西方和最东方的国家之间的坚固的纽带。因此，它同时也进一步加强和巩固了社会主义阵营国家的团结和一致。他的讲话经常为暴风雨般的掌声所打断。
    在格罗提渥总理讲话以后，德绍车厢制造厂技师霍恩和“友谊”农业生产合作社主任乌尔夫相继讲话，生动地报告了他们和中国、朝鲜和蒙古的工人、农民会见的情形。
    在人民议院外交政策委员会代表报告了这个委员会对中德条约讨论意见后，会议即进行表决。到会全体议员庄严地起立，一致拥护这个条约。表决后，人民议院主席狄克曼说：“我们向伟大的中国人民致敬。”全场起立热烈鼓掌。
