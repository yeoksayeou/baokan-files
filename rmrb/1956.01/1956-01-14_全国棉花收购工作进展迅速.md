National Cotton Procurement Work Progresses Rapidly

    Cotton procurement work in various provinces and cities is progressing rapidly. According to statistics at the end of last December, the nation had already completed 90% of the expanded cotton unified purchase plan, an increase of 83.6% over the same period in the previous year, and equivalent to 1.48 times the amount purchased in the same period of 1952, the year with the largest cotton purchase volume. Shandong, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hunan, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places with faster progress have already exceeded the annual cotton purchase plan.
    In the process of clearing cotton pre-purchase contracts with farmers, many areas also mobilized farmers to sell a batch of cotton. In Zanhua County, Shandong Province, the purchase volume increased by 16% in the five days after clearing the contracts compared to the five days before the clearing. In Guangming Township, Yanshi County, Henan Province, seven cotton farmers sold aged cotton. Cotton farmer Wang Zhongyi sold more than 500 jin of aged lint cotton after exceeding the pre-purchase contract. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    全国棉花收购工作进展迅速
    各省市收购棉花工作进展迅速。据去年12月底的统计，全国已经完成扩大后的棉花统购计划的90％，比前一个年度同期购棉量增加了83.6％，相当于购棉量最多的1952年同期的1.48倍。进展较快的山东、浙江、四川、湖南、上海、天津等地已经超额完成年度购棉计划。
    不少地区在同农民清理棉花预购合同的过程中，又动员农民卖了一批棉花。山东省沾化县清理合同以后的五天内，收购量比清理前五天上升了16％。河南省偃师县光明乡有七户棉农出售了陈棉，棉农王忠义超额完成了预购合同后，又卖出陈皮棉五百多斤。  （据新华社讯）
