    Guangdong Province Rural Areas
    Launch "Thousand Catty" Increase Production Movement

    (From our newspaper) Various areas of Guangdong Province are successively launching a "Thousand Catty Mu" movement to strive to achieve a yield of 1,000 catties of rice per mu this year. Chao'an County, which was awarded the title of "Thousand Catty High-Yield County" last year, recently proposed that the average yield of more than 300,000 mu of double-cropping rice in the county should reach 1,106 catties per mu (an increase of 8.8% over last year). Some areas of Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula, which have always had extensive cultivation and low yields, have also planned to take "Thousand Catty Mu" as a production goal to strive for.

    In order to ensure increased grain production this year, farmers in various regions are carrying out a large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement. The CPC Yuezhong District Committee recently issued a circular calling on all counties in the district to carry out a movement to accumulate 2,000 to 3,000 catties of fertilizer per mu. In Dianbai County, Yuexi District, farmers in many townships are working hard to achieve the goal of accumulating 10,000 catties of fertilizer per mu in order to become a "Thousand Catty Township".

    广东省农村
    开展“千斤”增产运动
    本报讯　广东省各地正陆续开展争取今年每亩水稻产量达到一千斤的“千斤亩”运动。去年获得“千斤丰产县”称号的潮安县，最近又提出全县30多万亩双季稻平均每亩产量要达到1，106斤的要求（比去年增产8.8％）。一向耕作粗放和产量较低的海南岛和雷州半岛的部分地区，也纷纷计划以“千斤亩”为生产奋斗目标。
    为了保证今年粮食增产，各地农民正在开展大规模的积肥运动。中共粤中区党委最近发出通报，号召全区各县开展每亩积肥二千斤到三千斤的运动。粤西区电白县许多乡的农民为了争取成为“千斤乡”，正热烈地为实现每亩田积肥一万斤的目标而努力。
