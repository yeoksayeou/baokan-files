    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂一号大型平炉在元旦又创造了快速炼钢的新纪录。这一炉钢由中午12时30分开始装料，到下午7时10分出完钢，只用了6小时40分钟，熔炼时间比过去的纪录又缩短了20分钟，质量也合乎国家指标。

    国营太原钢铁厂炼钢部的工人们在1956年元旦用4小时4分钟炼出了第一炉钢，熔炼时间比上一班在除夕创造的新纪录还缩短了8分钟。
    元旦这一天，炼钢部工人完成了钢产量计划117.5％，平均每炉钢冶炼时间是5小时49分，比计划缩短了17分钟。2日，炼钢部工人又完成钢产量计划118.2％，平均每炉钢的冶炼时间比元旦又缩短了16分钟，比计划缩短了27分钟。　（本报驻太原记者）
    国营上海冶炼厂有一座炼铜平炉的职工，在元旦早晨用了比国家计划少2小时1分钟的时间炼出一炉精铜，创造了新的纪录。

    1955年全面完成国家计划的国营广州水泥厂职工，在1956年的第一天，创造了生产新纪录。三台回转窑完成计划101.71％，比去年最后一天多生产熟料26吨；第三号窑以每台每时产13.22吨创造了全厂回转窑的最高纪录。水泥质量全部达到标准。每吨熟料的用煤量比计划降低20公斤。
    广州水泥厂在去年年底，曾经召开了全体职工大会，为在四年内完成第一个五年计划规定的任务进行了总动员，并且制定了13项具体保证措施。元旦出现的新成绩，为这个厂四年完成五年计划规定的任务创造了一个良好的开端。（本报驻广州记者）
