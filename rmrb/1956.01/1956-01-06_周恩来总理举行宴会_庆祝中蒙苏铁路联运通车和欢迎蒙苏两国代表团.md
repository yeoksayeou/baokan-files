Xinhua News Agency, January 5th. Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, held a banquet on the evening of the 5th to celebrate the opening of the China-Mongolia-Soviet trilateral railway through transport and to welcome the government delegations of Mongolia and the Soviet Union.

The entire Mongolian People's Republic government delegation headed by Luvsan and the entire Soviet government delegation headed by Beschev, Soviet Minister of Transport Construction Kozhevnikov, Mongolian Ambassador to China Ochirbat, Soviet Ambassador to China Yudin, and relevant Soviet experts in Beijing were invited to attend the banquet.

Those present at the reception included Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhang Bojun, Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan, Vice Ministers Lü Zhengcao, Wu Jingtai, Shi Zhiren, Liu Jianzhang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and other heads of relevant departments and people from all walks of life in the capital, totaling more than 200 people.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the banquet. On behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, he extended heartfelt congratulations on the completion of the Jining-Ulaanbaatar Railway and the opening of the China-Mongolia-Soviet trilateral railway through transport. He also expressed a warm welcome to the Mongolian and Soviet government delegations who were invited by our government to attend the opening ceremony of the China-Mongolia-Soviet trilateral railway through transport.

Premier Zhou Enlai said: The opening of the China-Mongolia-Soviet trilateral railway through transport has greatly shortened the distance of railway transport between the three countries. In the future, our country will import a large amount of industrial equipment and materials from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries at a faster speed, in a shorter time, and at a lower cost, which is of great significance for accelerating our country's socialist construction.

Premier Zhou Enlai also said: The opening of this railway through transport is a sign of the further strengthening of economic cooperation, trade exchanges, and cultural exchanges between our three fraternal countries. It fully embodies the unbreakable, fraternal friendly relations between our three countries. It is very appropriate for people to call this railway the "Road of Friendship."

Premier Zhou Enlai concluded by saying: The opening of this "Road of Friendship" through transport connects the fraternal countries in Europe and Asia more closely, providing more convenient conditions for these countries to closely cooperate and support each other in economic and cultural construction and in the struggle to defend world peace. This is of great significance for strengthening the power of the socialist camp of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union.

The head of the government delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic, Luvsan, then spoke. He said: The railway officially opened on January 1 this year, connecting the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the People's Republic of China, is of utmost importance in the cause of further consolidating the fraternal friendship between the people of Mongolia, China, and the Soviet Union and further expanding economic and cultural cooperation between our fraternal countries. This railway not only connects Moscow, Ulaanbaatar, and Beijing, but it is also the shortest route connecting the countries of Asia and Europe. It contributes to the development of friendship, peace, economic and cultural ties between the people of all countries. Therefore, our people rightly call this railway the "Road of Friendship."

On behalf of the government of the Mongolian People's Republic and the entire Mongolian people, Luvsan extended warm and heartfelt greetings to the government and people of the People's Republic of China, to the government and people of the Soviet Union, and to the heroic Chinese railway builders who have made tremendous efforts and demonstrated labor enthusiasm and heroism in the struggle for the smooth and early completion of this Road of Friendship.

The head of the Soviet government delegation, Beschev, said in his speech that the opening of the railway from Ulaanbaatar to Jining has greatly shortened the distance of direct trains from Moscow to Beijing and once again demonstrated the consolidation and development of friendly relations between our fraternal countries. This railway more closely connects the economic and cultural cooperation between the great People's Republic of China and the fraternal countries, and has great significance for further strengthening the power of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. He concluded by congratulating the further consolidation and development of the unity and friendship of the people of the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China.

After the banquet, a song and dance evening was held.

Xinhua News Agency, January 5th.

    庆祝中蒙苏铁路联运通车和欢迎蒙苏两国代表团
    新华社5日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来，在5日晚间举行宴会，庆祝中蒙苏三国铁路联运通车和欢迎蒙古和苏联两国政府代表团。
    以鲁布桑为首的蒙古人民共和国政府代表团和以别谢夫为首的苏联政府代表团全体人员，苏联运输建设部部长科热夫尼科夫，蒙古驻中国大使奥其尔巴特，苏联驻中国大使尤金和在京的有关苏联专家，应邀出席了宴会。
    出席招待会的，有国务院副总理李先念，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席章伯钧，铁道部部长滕代远、副部长吕正操、武竞天、石志仁、刘建章，外交部副部长章汉夫，以及其他有关部门的负责人和首都各界人士等共二百多人。
    周恩来总理在宴会上讲话。他代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民对集宁—乌兰巴托铁路的建成和中蒙苏三国铁路的联运通车表示衷心的祝贺，并向应我国政府邀请前来参加中蒙苏三国铁路联运通车典礼的蒙古和苏联两国政府代表团表示热烈欢迎。
    周恩来总理说：中蒙苏三国铁路的联运通车，使三国铁路运输的距离大大缩短了，今后，我国将以较快的速度、较短的时间和较省的费用从苏联以及其他兄弟国家输入大量的工业设备和器材，这对于加速我国社会主义建设具有重要的意义。
    周恩来总理又说：这条铁路的联运通车是我们三个兄弟国家之间经济合作、贸易往来和文化交流进一步加强的标志，它充分体现了我们三个国家之间牢不可破的兄弟般的友好关系，人们把这条铁路叫做“友谊之路”，是非常恰当的。
    周恩来总理最后说：这条“友谊之路”的联运通车，使在欧洲和在亚洲的兄弟国家更加紧密地联结在一起，使这些国家在经济、文化的建设事业中和在保卫世界和平的斗争中的亲密合作和互相支持有了更便利的条件，这对于加强以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的力量有着重要的意义。
    蒙古人民共和国政府代表团团长鲁布桑接着讲话。他说：今年1月1日正式通车的、联结着苏联、蒙古人民共和国和中华人民共和国的这条铁路，在蒙、中、苏三国人民间兄弟般的友谊进一步巩固和我们兄弟国家之间经济、文化合作进一步扩展的事业中，具有着极其重要的意义。这条铁路不仅联结着莫斯科、乌兰巴托和北京，它同时也是联结着亚洲、欧洲各国的一条最短的路径。它有助于各国人民间友谊、和平、经济和文化联系的发展。因此我国人民很正确地把这条铁路称作“友谊之路”。
    鲁布桑代表蒙古人民共和国政府和全体蒙古人民，向中华人民共和国政府及其人民，向苏联政府及其人民，向在为顺利、提前完成这条友谊之路修建的斗争中付出了巨大的努力和表现了劳动热情及英雄主义的英勇的中国筑路工人们致以热烈的、衷心的敬礼。
    苏联政府代表团团长别谢夫在讲话中说，从乌兰巴托到集宁的铁路通车了，它使莫斯科到北京直达火车的距离大大地缩短了，又一次表现了我们兄弟国家之间友好关系的巩固和发展。这条铁路把伟大的中华人民共和国和各兄弟国家的经济、文化合作事业更加密切地联系在一起，对进一步加强和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量有着重大的意义。他最后祝贺苏蒙中三国人民的团结和友谊更加巩固和发展。
    宴会以后，举行了歌舞晚会。
