    Resolution of the State Council on the Promulgation of the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme
    (Adopted at the 23rd Plenary Meeting of the State Council on January 28, 1956)
    The draft of the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme was proposed by the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee in January 1955. It was discussed and opinions were provided by approximately 200,000 people, including national linguists, language teachers from schools in various provinces and cities, and cultural and educational workers from the military and trade unions. It was then passed by the National Written Language Reform Conference in October 1955 and reviewed and finalized by the State Council's Chinese Character Simplification Scheme Review Committee.
    The Chinese Character Simplification Scheme is divided into three parts. The first part, the Simplified Chinese Character List One, lists 230 simplified Chinese characters. These have already been used on a trial basis by most newspapers and magazines and should be universally used in all printed and written documents nationwide from February 1, 1956. Except for reprinting ancient books and for other special reasons, the original traditional characters should cease to be used in printed materials. The second part, the Simplified Chinese Character List Two, lists 285 simplified Chinese characters, and the third part, the Simplified Radical List, lists 54 simplified radicals. These have also been thoroughly discussed by relevant parties and are considered appropriate. Now, for the sake of prudence, they are first promulgated for trial use, and the People's Committees of each province and city are responsible for inviting members of the Provincial and Municipal Political Consultative Conferences to solicit opinions, and report to the State Council before the end of March, so that some necessary revisions can be made based on the majority opinion, and then formally promoted in batches.

    国务院关于公布汉字简化方案的决议
    （1956年1月28日国务院全体会议第二十三次会议通过）
    汉字简化方案，1955年1月由中国文字改革委员会提出草案，经全国文字学家、各省市学校的语文教师以及部队、工会的文教工作者约20万人参加讨论，提供意见，再经1955年10月全国文字改革会议通过，并由国务院汉字简化方案审订委员会审订完毕。
    汉字简化方案分三部分。第一部分即汉字简化第一表所列简化汉字共230个，已经由大部分报纸杂志试用，应该从1956年2月1日起在全国印刷的和书写的文件上一律通用；除翻印古籍和有其他特殊原因的以外，原来的繁体字应该在印刷物上停止使用。第二部分即汉字简化第二表所列简化汉字285个和第三部分即汉字偏旁简化表所列简化偏旁54个，也都已经经过有关各方详细讨论，认为适当。现在为慎重起见，特先行公布试用，并责成各省市人民委员会负责邀集本省市政治协商委员会委员征求意见，在3月底以前报告国务院，以便根据多数意见再作某些必要的修正，然后正式分批推行。
