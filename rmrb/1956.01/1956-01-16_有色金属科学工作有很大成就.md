Non-ferrous metals industry scientific workers have conducted a series of research projects over the past six years, making important contributions to the production of the non-ferrous metals industry.

	In terms of mineral processing, the laboratories of various non-ferrous metal industrial enterprises and the non-ferrous metal industry testing institutes in Shenyang and Ganzhou have cooperated to solve many problems in production. For example, after researching and determining the amount, size, and ratio of balls loaded into ball mills in concentrators, the grinding capacity increased by 5% to 8%. A laboratory in a certain concentrator successfully researched and implemented tailing classification, regrinding, and re-election, increasing the actual recovery rate of mineral processing. They can recover dozens of tons of precious metals for the country every year. In the past three years, the design data provided by the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Comprehensive Research Institute for the basic construction and expansion of concentrators has basically guaranteed the needs of design and mineral processing production. The research results on mineral processing agents have basically guaranteed the needs of major flotation agents for flotation plants across the country.

	In terms of smelting, research into the operating process and equipment conditions of vertical zinc smelting has improved the quality of briquettes and condensation efficiency, increasing the recovery rate of zinc by 20%. The research results of the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Comprehensive Research Institute on several ferroalloys in steelmaking raw materials completed for ferrous metallurgy have become an important basis for plant design. There have also been many achievements in new production methods, such as the trial use of fluidized roasting in the desulfurization roasting process before smelting ore, which increases the processing capacity per unit area by more than 10 times compared to the methods currently used in production.

	In terms of analysis, relevant analytical units have mastered the elements of analytical methods, totaling 45 types including sodium, potassium, tungsten, manganese, iron, copper, tin, and lead. Important achievements have been made in the use of instruments for polarographic analysis and spectral analysis of minerals for chemical phase analysis (analysis of mineral composition). This has played a major role in coordinating production calculations, controlling operating indicators, and comprehensive utilization of raw materials.

	Non-ferrous metals industry scientific workers have also cooperated with various factories and mines in promoting Soviet advanced experience and in conjunction with rationalization proposals put forward by employees, carrying out many important research projects.

    有色金属科学工作有很大成就
    有色金属工业科学工作者6年来进行了一系列的研究工作，对有色金属工业生产作了重要贡献。
    选矿方面，各有色金属工业企业的试验室和沈阳、赣州两地的有色金属工业试验所，都配合解决了生产上的许多问题。如选矿场球磨机装球的多少、大小和相互间的比例问题，经研究确定后，磨矿能力提高了5％到8％。某选矿场试验室，研究尾矿分级再磨再选成功，提高了选矿实收率。他们每年可以为国家多回收几十吨贵重金属。近3年来，有色金属工业综合研究所为基本建设和扩建选矿场提供的设计数据，基本上保证了设计、选矿生产的需要。选矿药剂方面的研究成果，已经可以基本上保证全国浮选场主要浮选药剂的需要。
    冶炼方面，由于进行了竖出炼锌的操作过程和设备情况的研究，提高了团矿质量和冷凝效率，使锌的回收率提高20％。有色金属工业综合研究所为黑色冶金完成的炼钢原料中几种铁合金的研究结果，成了建厂设计的重要依据。关于新生产方法也有不少成就，如在熔炼矿石前焙烧脱硫的过程中试用沸腾焙烧的方法，使单位面积处理能力比现在生产用的方法提高10倍以上。
    分析方面，各有关分析单位已经掌握了分析方法的元素，计有钠、钾、钨、锰、铁、铜、锡、铅等45种。关于化学物相分析（对矿物组成的分析），使用仪器对矿物作极谱分析和光谱分析，都已经获得重要成就。这对配合生产计算、控制作业指标和原料的综合利用，起了很大作用。
    有色金属工业科学工作者还配合各厂矿在推行苏联先进经验和配合职工提出的合理化建议，进行了许多重要的研究工作。
