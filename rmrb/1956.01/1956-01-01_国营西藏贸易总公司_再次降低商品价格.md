    State-owned Tibet Trading Company
    Further Reduces Commodity Prices
    From the 28th, the state-owned Tibet Trading Company has reduced the prices of domestic goods by 5% to 42%. This is the third price reduction for domestic goods since the opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways. The prices of domestic goods operated by the state-owned Tibet Trading Company are now, on average, about 20% lower than before the opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways. The person in charge of the business department of the state-owned Tibet Trading Company told reporters that the successive reductions in the prices of domestic goods are to enable the broad masses of Tibetan people to buy more inexpensive and high-quality goods from the interior.
    The state-owned Tibet Trading Company has also decided to expand its wholesale business of domestic goods to Tibetan merchants, wholesaling various domestic goods according to their needs.
