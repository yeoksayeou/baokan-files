    National Local Transportation Conference Plans Seven-Year Transportation Construction
    (Our dispatch) The Ministry of Communications convened the National Local Transportation Conference at the end of 1955. This conference initially planned the construction of local transportation nationwide over the next seven years and determined the specific policies and speed of the socialist transformation of private transportation businesses.
    In its plan, the Ministry of Communications determined that within the next seven years, the national road network would be basically completed, and basic greening of all the nation's highways would be achieved. At the same time, it required active surveying, harnessing, and dredging of small and medium-sized rivers, a large-scale opening of navigation routes, the development of inland river shipping, and the achievement of basic greening along both banks of waterways. It required the completion of the socialist transformation of capitalist and individual-economy-based automobile, ship, and vehicle repair industries, as well as wooden sailing boats and animal-powered vehicles, within the next two years. It also required local transportation enterprises to improve their business management, develop water and land transportation networks, actively reduce freight rates, and implement the principle of low profits and high volume to serve national industrialization and agricultural collectivization. All provinces, cities, special districts, counties, districts, and townships should make comprehensive plans for the development of local transportation.
