Catching Up with the Advanced Level of World Science
Ge Tingsui, Researcher at the Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences

The Party calls on scientific workers to tap all potential forces to bring China's science up to the advanced world level in a short period. This is the supreme trust of the Party and the people in scientific workers. This call embodies the aspirations of every patriotic scientific worker. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we realize this aspiration.

As a scientific worker in New China, we cannot but sincerely thank the Party for its help and education in the years since liberation. Recalling that not long after liberation, when I returned to China from the United States at the end of 1949, I dreamed of being able to do outstanding scientific research work on Chinese soil and in our own laboratories, with cadres trained by our own country, to win honor for the Chinese people. But soon, I gradually realized that my so-called winning honor for the Chinese people in scientific research was actually just competing with the scientific research systems of capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States. At this time, I realized that I had a strong pro-American ideology. The great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the study of ideological remolding greatly improved my thinking. Now, I seem to have a sense of enlightenment, and I am determined to work harder and contribute my greatest strength to the scientific cause of the motherland.

This time, I was honored to participate in the Chinese scientific delegation to Japan led by President Guo Moruo. During the three weeks of my visit to Japan, I had several opportunities to report the research results we have achieved in New China in recent years to many Japanese scientists. These results are very limited, but they were all made in the territory of New China, in our own laboratories, by cadres trained by our New China. Therefore, I was full of joy and happiness when I reported, full of a sense of humility but also firm self-confidence of the Chinese people who had stood up. The praise and respect of the Japanese scientists for us reflected their admiration for the superiority of the social system of New China. This made me personally experience the glory of being a scientific worker in New China.

Since liberation, New China's scientific cause has made certain achievements. In order to vigorously develop the scientific cause, the Party and the government have now proposed the issue of formulating a comprehensive plan for scientific research. Judging from the current situation in our country, some scientific departments already have a slight foundation, while some scientific departments are blank. Supplementing these blank spots and further rapid improvement of scientific departments that already have a foundation are urgent issues that need to be focused on and resolved. I think that in order to make our country's science rapidly reach the advanced world level, it seems that we can adopt the method of focusing on breakthroughs, that is, concentrating some forces to vigorously cultivate and develop several scientific departments, making them academic peaks in China. The construction of such peaks may have a driving effect on our country's science and our scientists. This peak can attract and promote related scientific research work. When the number of peaks gradually increases, the various peaks may be connected to each other, forming a large peak of the entire Chinese science.

The selection of departments for such academic peaks to be cultivated on a trial basis should be in line with the needs of national construction, and at the same time, there must be mature experts in this area; the development of the Soviet Union in this scientific field and the assistance and cooperation it can provide us are also important factors that need to be considered.

After deciding to cultivate and develop a certain academic peak, we should concentrate the existing scientific research forces in this area to carry out joint research. This method of collaborative research is an extremely important measure for promoting research work and cultivating cadres. In the past, many scientific workers in our country (including myself) adopted the research method of painstakingly managing and being self-sufficient, which at best could only achieve some results on some smaller issues, and it was impossible to carry out and solve large scientific problems involving a wider range. Concentrating forces and conducting joint research can more quickly improve the level of our scientific research work. Therefore, it is recommended that the personnel department of the government consider this more when allocating and adjusting manpower.

In addition, in order to encourage scientific workers to give play to collective wisdom and strength, we must vigorously promote visits, exchanges of research information, and academic discussions among scientific workers. Therefore, it is recommended that the Party and the government consider appropriate ways to solve the confidentiality problem so that it helps this exchange. State secrets must be kept. However, the scope of confidentiality must be appropriately determined, otherwise, it will hinder this exchange. We must vigorously strengthen domestic academic exchanges and academic exchanges with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and we should also conduct academic exchanges with other countries. In the past, we may not have paid enough attention to international academic exchanges, and scientific workers also had some ideological concerns about being afraid of trouble and making mistakes, so they often did not reply to letters, blocking exchanges and connections.

Rapidly developing Chinese science and catching up with the advanced world level in a short period, what a kind and attractive call this is for scientists! We must work harder, give play to collective strength and wisdom, and under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, lead and help the vast number of young scientific workers in New China to bring Chinese science to the advanced world level!

    赶上世界科学的先进水平
    中国科学院金属研究所研究员　葛庭燧
    党号召科学工作者发掘一切潜在力量，要在不长的时期内使中国的科学达到世界先进水平。这是党和人民对于科学工作者们的无上信任。这个号召体现了每一个爱国的科学工作者的愿望，只有中国共产党和毛主席的领导，我们才能实现这个愿望。
    作为一个新中国的科学工作者，我们不能不衷心地感激党在解放后几年来对于我们的帮助和教育。回忆解放后不久，我在1949年底从美国回国的时候，我憧憬着要在中国的土地上、在中国自己的实验室里，能够由我们自己的国家培养的干部作出出色的科学研究工作，为中国人争一口气。但是不久，我就渐渐发现，我所谓的要在科学研究上为中国人争一口气，实际上不过是要在英美等资本主义国家的科学研究体系中争短长，这时我才认识到我有着浓厚的崇美思想。伟大的抗美援朝运动和思想改造的学习，使我的思想大大提高了一步。现在，我好像是有了一种豁然开朗的感觉，我决心加倍努力，辛勤地工作，为祖国的科学事业贡献出最大的力量。
    这次我很荣幸地参加了以郭沫若院长为首的中国访日科学代表团，在访日的三个星期当中，我曾经有几次能够在许多日本科学家面前报告我们这几年在新中国所获得的研究结果。这些结果是很有限的，但却都是在新中国的国土上、在新中国自己的实验室里，由我们新中国自己培养的干部作出来的。因而我在报告的时候心里充满着愉快和喜悦，充满着一种站了起来的中国人民的谦虚的但却是坚定而自信的感觉。日本的科学家们对于我们的称赞和尊重，反映了他们对新中国的社会制度的优越性的景仰。这更使我亲身体会到作为一个新中国的科学工作者的光荣。
    解放以后，新中国的科学事业有了一定的成绩。为了大力发展科学事业，现在党和政府已经提出了拟定科学研究工作的全面规划的问题。就我国目前的情况来看，有些科学部门已经略有基础，有些科学部门则是空白的。这些空白点的补充以及已经有基础的科学部门的进一步迅速提高，是目前急需着重考虑和解决的问题。我认为要使我国科学迅速地达到世界先进水平，似乎可以采取重点突破的方法，即集中若干力量大力培养和发展某几个科学部门，使它成为中国学术上的高峰。这种高峰的建成，可能会对于我国的科学和我国科学家有一种带动的作用。这种高峰能够牵引和提升同它有关联的科学研究工作。当高峰的数目逐渐增多的时候，各个高峰就有可能相互衔接起来，形成整个中国科学的大高峰。
    这种作为试点培养的学术高峰的部门的选择，应该合乎国家建设的需要，同时必须具有在这方面的成熟的专家；苏联在这个科学领域的发展情况以及能够给予我们的帮助和合作，也是一个需要考虑的重要因素。
    在决定培养和发展某一个学术高峰以后，应该集中现有的关于这方面的科学研究力量来共同进行研究。这种通力合作的研究方式对于推进研究工作和培养干部都是一个极其重要的措施。过去我国许多科学工作者（包括我自己在内）所采取的辛辛苦苦自已经营和自给自足的研究方式，充其量只能在一些较小的问题上得到一些成果，不可能进行和解决牵涉较广的科学上的大问题。集中力量，共同研究，可以更快地提高我们的科学研究工作水平。因此建议政府的人事部门在分配和调整人力的时候多多考虑这一点。
    另外，为了鼓励科学工作者们发挥集体的智慧和力量，必须大力地提倡科学工作者之间的参观访问、交换研究情况和展开学术讨论。因此建议党和政府考虑适当的办法来解决保密问题，使它有助于这种交流。国家的机密必须保守。但是机密的范围要确定得恰当，否则，它就会妨碍这种交流。我们要大力地加强国内的学术交流以及同苏联和各人民民主国家的学术交流，也应该进行同其它国家的学术交流。过去我们对于国际上的学术交流可能注意得很不够，科学工作者们也有些怕麻烦和怕犯错误的思想顾虑，因而常常来信不复，阻塞了交流和联系。
    迅速发展中国科学，在不长的时期内赶上世界先进水平，这个号召对于科学家们是多么亲切和富有吸引力！我们一定要加倍地努力工作，发挥集体的力量和智慧，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，带动和帮助新中国的广大青年科学工作者，使中国的科学达到世界先进水平！
