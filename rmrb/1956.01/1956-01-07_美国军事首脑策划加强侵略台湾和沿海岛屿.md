Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch: In the course of their Far East "trip" these days, American Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford and Air Force Secretary Quarles have arrived in Taiwan one after the other to carry out activities. On the 5th, they held talks with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. Before this, Radford had already held a secret meeting with the Chiang traitor. According to Agence France-Presse on the 4th, they want to review the "various tactical and strategic military plans" that have been drawn up regarding the "defense" of the coastal islands occupied by Chiang's bandit troops, as well as "when they will implement these emergency plans, when the American troops here (Taiwan) will finally participate in the defense, and the scale of participation."

Radford and Quarles are following in the footsteps of U.S. Army Secretary Brucker and Navy Secretary Thomas, among others, in traveling to the Far East and Taiwan to carry out activities.
