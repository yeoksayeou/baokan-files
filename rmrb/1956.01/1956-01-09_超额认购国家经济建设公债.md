Oversubscription of National Economic Construction Bonds

Amidst the accelerated advancement of our nation's socialist construction and socialist transformation, the issuance of the 1956 National Construction Bonds will inevitably attract the attention of the people nationwide. Many have already prepared to subscribe, and a surge of enthusiastic subscription is expected to sweep the country soon. It is believable that the 1956 National Construction Bonds will be completed and oversubscribed ahead of schedule.

Our agricultural cooperativization has experienced a tremendous leap forward, and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has also entered a new phase. In terms of industrial construction, the tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan will be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule.

To complete and overfulfill the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule requires greater efforts to accumulate more funds. The primary sources of funding are the revenue from state-owned enterprises and various taxes, but the issuance of national bonds is also a regular and important method of raising construction funds. This is not only a long-standing and effective method in the Soviet Union, but the experience of issuing national economic construction bonds in our country in 1954 and 1955 has also fully demonstrated this point.

Issuing bonds is not only an important method of raising construction funds, but also a good way to promote people's savings. By purchasing bonds, people support national construction and can share in the fruits of national construction in the future, with their lives gradually improving. Furthermore, bondholders can receive a certain amount of interest income in addition to the principal repayment at maturity. This year alone, the state will pay out more than 58 million yuan in bond interest to bondholders. This shows that purchasing bonds benefits both the country and individuals.

It should be pointed out that conducting patriotic education among the broad masses of people through bond sales is also of great significance. It enhances the socialist consciousness of the people nationwide, strengthens their concern and sense of responsibility for the nation's socialist construction, and fosters the virtue of saving and thrift.

It is precisely because the bonds issued in our country have the above-mentioned important economic and political significance that the people across the country have responded to the government's call with practical actions in recent years. Taking the national economic construction bonds issued in the past two years as an example, the people nationwide have fully demonstrated a high degree of patriotism, warmly supporting the issuance of bonds and actively subscribing during the bond sales process. In particular, the vast number of workers and cadres in the armed forces have played an exemplary leading role, not only exceeding the subscription quotas but also completing them quickly. Although the promotion of bonds in rural areas was somewhat lacking in integration with central tasks in some regions, and the arrangements were not well made, which had some impact on the subscription work, farmers were equally enthusiastic in subscribing to bonds. Some areas even overfulfilled the projected sales figures within a relatively short period. Private industrial and commercial households also generally subscribed enthusiastically to the bonds. Due to the enthusiastic subscription of people from all walks of life, both the 1954 and 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds overfulfilled the projected sales amounts.

The issuance of our country's bonds is built on the foundation of the development of national economic construction and the continuous improvement of people's welfare. The number of workers and staff in our country is increasing year by year. According to the First Five-Year Plan, the number of workers and staff in state-owned enterprises, cooperative enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, state organs, people's organizations, and cultural, educational, and health departments will increase by 5.36 million in five years, and the average wage of workers and staff will increase by approximately 33% in five years. Regarding farmers, although some areas suffered from floods in 1954, due to the efforts of all farmers, grain production still increased by 1.6% compared to 1953. In 1955, due to the implementation of the "Three Fixes" policy for grain and the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, coupled with a reduction in natural disasters, the enthusiasm of farmers for production was greatly increased, resulting in a bumper harvest of both grain and cotton nationwide. According to preliminary estimates by the Ministry of Agriculture, the national grain output in 1955 will increase by 24.8 billion catties compared to 1954, and cotton (lint) will increase by more than 7.2 million dan compared to 1954. It is certain that agricultural output will continue to increase in 1956 due to the great development of the cooperative movement and the adoption of other basic measures. Private industry and commerce will be better guaranteed to obtain reasonable profits due to the socialist transformation and overall planning. This provides a solid material foundation for the state's issuance of bonds in 1956. Coupled with the patriotic spirit and increased political awareness of the people nationwide, the issuance of bonds in 1956 will definitely be overfulfilled.

In the past two years, thanks to the enthusiastic support of the people nationwide and the attention of party and government leaders at all levels, the bond sales work has achieved great success. However, in the past two years, the bond sales have also shown imbalances between different classes and regions. In order to better complete the bond sales work, local party and government leaders are required to pay more attention to this work, conduct widespread publicity and education among the people of all classes, repeatedly promote the significance of the state's issuance of bonds and its benefits to the country and the people, explain the bond regulations in detail, and introduce the methods of subscribing to bonds, so that the people nationwide can understand the principles and methods of issuing bonds. Especially in the vast rural areas, in addition to doing a good job of publicity to make it known to every household, it is also necessary to strengthen the organizational work of bond sales, adopt a method combined with the collection of agricultural taxes, and have dedicated personnel from the county to the district responsible for this work. Experience has shown that farmers are very active and enthusiastic in subscribing to and paying for the bonds issued by the state. As long as the organizational work is done well, the projected sales figures can be overfulfilled in a relatively short period. Some ideas that fear affecting the central work or believe that "the figures are not large and not a problem" and do not conduct vigorous publicity and specific promotion must be corrected. As for the vast number of workers and cadres in the armed forces, they should continue to promote the exemplary leading role and overfulfill the bond subscription quotas. Private enterprises and private parties in joint state-private enterprises should also continue to promote the spirit of patriotism and strive to overfulfill the bond subscription tasks.

With a bumper harvest in agriculture, increased industrial production, an accelerated pace of socialist advancement, and the people's enthusiasm for building socialism growing day by day, we can fully anticipate that the people nationwide will use the action of enthusiastically subscribing to bonds to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the 1956 bond sales task!

### 超额认购国家经济建设公债

　　超额认购国家经济建设公债
    在我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造工作加快速度前进中，1956年国家建设公债的发行必然引起全国人民的重视，有很多人已经做了认购公债的准备，全国各地很快就会掀起一个踊跃认购公债的热潮。可以相信，1956年的国家建设公债将按期地超额地完成预计的推销数额。
    我国农业合作化有了突飞猛进的发展，资本主义工商业的改造也进入了新阶段。在工业建设方面，第一个五年计划规定的任务将被提早完成和超额完成。
    要提早和超额完成五年计划就必须以更大的努力积累更多的资金。资金的来源，主要是依靠国营企业的收入和各项税收，但国家发行公债也是筹集建设资金的经常的和重要的方法之一。这不但在苏联是早已行之有效的办法，就是我国发行1954和1955两年的国家经济建设公债的经验，也充分证明了这一点。
    发行公债不仅是筹集建设资金的一个重要的方法，而且也是促进人民节约储蓄的一种良好方式。人民购买公债一方面支援了国家建设，将来可以分享国家建设的果实，生活得到逐步改善；另一方面购债人除到期收回本金以外，还可以得到一定的利息收入。就以今年来说，国家偿付购债人的公债利息将达5，800多万元。这说明购买公债是对国家和个人都有好处的事情。
    应当指出，通过公债的推销，对全国广大人民进行爱国主义教育，这个意义也很重大。它提高了全国人民的社会主义觉悟，加强了人民对国家社会主义建设的关心和责任感，同时还树立了人民节约储蓄的美德。
    正因为我国发行的公债具有上述重要的经济意义和政治意义，所以全国人民几年来就曾以实际的行动响应了政府的号召。以近两年国家发行的经济建设公债为例，全国人民在这两年的公债推销过程中，充分表现了高度的爱国主义精神，热烈拥护公债的发行，积极踊跃认购，其中尤其是全国的广大职工及部队干部发挥了模范带头作用，他们不但超额多，而且完成快。农村推销公债，虽然有些地区和中心工作结合不够，安排得还不好，对认购工作有些影响，但是农民认购公债同样是十分踊跃的，有些地区在较短的时间内就超额完成了预计推销数字。私营工商业户一般也踊跃认购了公债。由于各阶层人民踊跃认购公债，使1954年度、1955年度的国家经济建设公债都超额完成了预计推销的数额。
    我国公债的发行是建筑在国家经济建设的发展和人民福利不断增进的基础上的。我国的工人和职员人数逐年增加，按照第一个五年计划的规定，国营企业、合作社营企业、公私合营企业、国家机关、人民团体和文化教育卫生部门的工人和职员，五年内将增加536万人，职工的平均工资在五年内约增长33％。在农民方面，1954年部分地区虽然遭受了水灾，但是由于全体农民的努力，粮食产量仍然比1953年增加了1.6％，而1955年由于粮食“三定”政策的贯彻和农业合作化运动的发展，加上自然灾害减少，大大提高了农民生产的积极性，因而全国粮食和棉花都已获得丰收。据农业部的初步预计，1955年全国粮食产量将比1954年增产248亿斤，棉花（皮棉）比1954年增产720多万担。由于合作化运动的大发展和采取其它基本措施，1956年的农业产量还要继续增加也是肯定了的。私营工商业由于进行了社会主义的改造和统筹安排，将更有保证得到合理的利润。这就有力地给国家1956年发行公债提供了可靠的物质基础。加以全国人民爱国主义的精神和政治觉悟的提高，1956年公债的发行是一定能够超额完成的。
    两年来由于全国人民的热烈拥护，各级党政领导的重视，公债的推销工作有很大的成绩；但是两年来公债的推销，不论在阶层间或地区间还有不平衡现象。为了更好地完成公债推销工作，要求各地党政领导更加重视这一工作，对各阶层人民普遍地进行宣传教育，反复地宣传国家发行公债的意义和它对国家和人民的好处，详细解释公债条例，介绍认购公债的办法，使全国人民都能懂得发行公债的道理和办法；尤其是对广大农村，除了做好宣传工作，使家喻户晓以外，还必须加强推销公债的组织工作，采取与农业税征收结合的办法，由县到区设专人负责这一工作。经验证明，农民对国家发行的公债在认购和缴款上都是非常积极踊跃的，只要组织工作做好，就能在较短的时间内超额完成。某些怕影响中心工作或认为“数字不大不成问题”而不进行大力宣传和具体推动的想法都必须纠正。至于全国广大职工和部队干部，应该继续发扬模范带头的作用，超额完成公债的认购数额。全国私营企业和公私合营企业的私方也应该继续发扬爱国主义的精神，争取超额完成公债认购的任务。
    农业丰收，工业增产，社会主义前进步伐加快，全国人民建设社会主义的热情日益高涨。我们完全可以预料，全国人民将以踊跃认购公债的行动，来保证完成和超额完成1956年的公债推销任务！
