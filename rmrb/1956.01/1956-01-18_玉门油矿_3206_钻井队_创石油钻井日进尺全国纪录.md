    Yumen Oilfield's 3206 Drilling Team
    Sets National Record for Daily Footage in Oil Drilling
    On January 4th, the 3206 drilling team of the Yumen Oilfield Drilling Department set a new national record of 462.3 meters for daily footage in oil drilling at an exploration well in the Jiuquan Basin. This is 90 meters more than the highest daily footage record of Yumen Oilfield in 1955.
    After studying the advanced Soviet experience in rapid drilling and the experience of Wang Hualan's drilling team in saving non-production time, the drilling workers of Team 3206 can now drill 0.6 meters per minute. After setting the highest daily footage record, they have now proposed a daily target of 500 meters and launched a competition with brother teams.

    玉门油矿3206钻井队
    创石油钻井日进尺全国纪录
    1月4日玉门油矿钻井处3206钻井队，在酒泉盆地的一口探井创造了石油钻井日进尺462.3公尺的全国新纪录。比玉门油矿1955年的石油钻井日进尺最高纪录又多了90公尺。
    3206队的钻井工人，学习了苏联快速钻井的先进经验和王化兰钻井队节约非生产时间的经验以后，一分钟就可以钻进0.6公尺。他们在创造了日进尺最高纪录以后，现在又提出了日进五百公尺的倡议，向兄弟队展开竞赛。
