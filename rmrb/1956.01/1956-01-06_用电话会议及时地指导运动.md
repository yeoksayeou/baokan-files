　　Using Telephone Conferences to Guide Movements in a Timely Manner
　　By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo
　　On November 30, 1955, when people were already asleep, the telephone conference convened by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party began. Participating in the conference were responsible personnel from various provincial-level organs, secretaries of various regional committees, responsible personnel from various departments of the regional committees, as well as county committee secretaries and responsible personnel from county-level organs of more than 20 counties, including Chang'an.
　　First, Comrade Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee, spoke into the loudspeaker, putting forward opinions on several issues in the current establishment of cooperatives and soliciting opinions from various localities. In addition to expressing their agreement with Comrade Zhang Desheng's report, the comrades from various localities participating in the conference also raised some questions. Comrade Zhang Desheng and other responsible comrades of the Provincial Committee answered the questions raised by the various localities one by one. The meeting lasted for two hours before it ended.
　　Before holding this telephone conference, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee had made a lot of preparations. Comrade Zhang Desheng personally went deep into Ankang, Hanzhong, Baoji and other areas, as well as Xianyang, Chang'an and other counties under the province's jurisdiction, to check the current work of establishing cooperatives. In the above-mentioned areas, he held talks with leaders at all levels, held symposiums among cadres establishing cooperatives, and talked with many cooperative directors and farmers. During the inspection, it was found that the publicity work in the above-mentioned areas was not universal and in-depth enough. For example, the publicity of agricultural cooperation to farmers in mountainous areas was very insufficient. Therefore, they said: "You haven't sent Chairman Mao's instructions up the mountain yet." In rural areas where publicity was better at the beginning of the agricultural cooperation movement, cadres saw that the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers was very high, and therefore, a kind of complacency began to grow. They believed that the "publicity stage" had passed and that there was no need to carry out publicity and education work anymore. But in fact, the masses still did not understand many issues about running cooperatives. These problems were not isolated phenomena, and if they were not resolved, the ideological mobilization of the masses would not be thorough, which would affect the quality of establishing cooperatives.
　　Comrade Zhang Desheng also found many urgent problems to be solved in the evaluation of the means of production and the establishment of the leadership advantage of poor peasants during the inspection. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party studied Comrade Zhang Desheng's inspection report and the reports of various regional committees, and studied the work reports of the staff members sent by the Provincial Committee to various localities to help establish cooperatives. It was believed that if the various new problems currently discovered were not resolved in a timely manner, the healthy development of the agricultural cooperation movement would be affected. If the responsible comrades from various localities were to be convened for a meeting, it would also delay time. Therefore, it was decided to hold this telephone conference.
　　After the Provincial Committee's telephone conference, various regional committees held telephone conferences attended by responsible personnel of various county committees. The county committees of each county (counties with telephone equipment in each district) held telephone conferences attended by the secretaries of each district committee, one after another, to make specific arrangements for the instructions of the Provincial Committee.
　　The telephone conference held by the Provincial Committee was very timely. Comrade Wang Huairen, Deputy Secretary of the Yulin Regional Committee, said that the instructions of this telephone conference were very timely. At that time, the situation in the Yulin area was that there was more publicity for villages with concentrated households, and less publicity for mountain villages with scattered households; more publicity for young and middle-aged people, and less publicity for the elderly and women. Most of the Yulin area is a marginal area, and farmers live very scattered, especially in the three-border area, ten li per household, eight li per household, and some farmers still did not know Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperation. After the telephone conference, cadres generally paid attention to this situation and went to remote farm households in groups to carry out publicity in the form of holding family meetings. This promoted the movement to farmers living in remote areas and moved the movement forward.
　　Facts have proved that telephone conferences are one of the effective methods for the Party to achieve timely guidance of mass movements. Through telephone conferences, not only can the intentions of the leadership be quickly transmitted, but also some problems that cannot be solved below can be raised and resolved in a timely manner, and opinions can be exchanged between the top and bottom and between regions in a timely manner. In the past, it took a long time for the Provincial Committee to convene a joint meeting of regional committee secretaries to implement the intentions of the Provincial Committee. From the Provincial Committee convening a joint meeting of regional committee secretaries, to the regional committee convening a meeting of county committee secretaries, and the county committee convening meetings of cadres at all levels, and finally transmitting it to the rural areas, it took more than ten days for Weinan and Baoji special districts, which were closest to the Provincial Committee and had the most convenient transportation conditions. As for those remote areas, it took even longer. For example, it took more than ten days for the Ankang Regional Committee to send people to the Provincial Committee for meetings, and often other areas had already begun to convey the intentions of the Provincial Committee, while the people attending the meeting in the Ankang area were still on the road. It took seven or eight days for the secretaries of the county committees to travel back and forth on the road to attend the meeting of the regional committee secretaries. It took three or four days for the people attending the meeting to report to the county for meetings of cadres at all levels, because they were all mountainous areas, and many districts were two or three hundred li away from the county. In this way, it would take at least a month for the intentions of the Provincial Committee to be transmitted to the village. Now, using the form of telephone conferences, it only takes a maximum of five days to transmit to the rural areas (including mountain villages). Cadres in the Ankang area felt that they could often hear the voices of the leading comrades of the Provincial Committee in this movement, which could make the top and bottom more connected. In the special districts near the Provincial Committee, it generally only takes two or three days for the intentions of the Provincial Committee to be conveyed to the village, especially those counties that directly participated in the Provincial Committee's telephone conference, which generally conveyed the intentions of the Provincial Committee to the rural areas the next day.
　　Telephone conferences have many advantages, but they also have their limitations. According to the three telephone conferences held by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee in November and December 1955, it is best to hold telephone conferences at midnight, and the meeting time is most appropriate for about two hours, because the sound of the telephone is clearer during this time, and this time will not hinder other areas from making long-distance calls, and the telephone bill can be reduced by half. The content of telephone conferences can only be the most important issues, and the Party committees at all levels in Shaanxi Province generally grasp this principle. Therefore, telephone conferences cannot replace all Party meetings. Telephone conferences cannot replace the responsible personnel of Party organizations from going deep into the masses to understand the situation of the movement and solve problems specifically. It can only be one of the effective methods for the Party committee to guide the movement in a timely manner. It can assist the Party organization to better understand the situation at the lower level and solve the urgent problems to be solved in the movement in a timely manner.
　　Telephone conferences are conducted through long-distance calls. This requires the help of the staff of the telephone bureau, such as having them responsible for notification, and also requiring the long-distance station to ensure smooth lines during the meeting. Amplification equipment should be set up in the Provincial Committee's conference room. The comrade who manages the amplifier should adjust the machine in advance and ensure that there are no failures during the meeting. The regional committees and some county committees in Shaanxi Province have amplification equipment, so that more people can participate in the meeting (regional and county committees with amplification equipment have more than 20 people participating in the telephone conference).
　　In order to improve telephone conferences, the Provincial Committee has also formulated some disciplines and regulations. For example, the personnel of the telephone conference must arrive early, speak in order, and the personnel participating in the conference must remain silent. Recently, the Provincial Committee notified all localities that before participating in the telephone conference, they should write the most important situation of the current movement into a speech of three to five hundred words and speak at the meeting, so that the telephone conference will be held even better.

### 用电话会议及时地指导运动

　　用电话会议及时地指导运动
    本报记者　朱波
    1955年11月30日，人们都已经入睡，中共陕西省委召开的电话会议开始了。参加会议的有省级各机关的负责人员、各地委的书记、地委各部门的负责人员，以及长安等20多个县的县委书记和县级机关的负责人员。
    首先由陕西省委第一书记张德生同志在扩音器前，提出了关于当前建社中几个问题的意见，征求各地意见。各地参加会议的同志除了都表示同意张德生同志的报告以外，还提了一些问题。张德生同志和省委其他负责同志对各地提的问题一一作了解答。会议进行了两小时就结束了。
    在开这次电话会议以前，陕西省委作了很多准备工作。张德生同志亲自深入到安康、汉中、宝鸡等地区以及省辖县咸阳、长安等地，检查当前建社工作。在上述地区，他同各级领导人员进行了谈话，在建社干部中召开座谈会，并且同很多社的主任、农民谈了话。在检查工作中，发现上述地区宣传工作不普遍和不深入。如对山区农民宣传农业合作化就非常不够，因此，他们说：“你们还没有把毛主席的指示送上山”。在农业合作化运动开始时宣传较好的农村，干部看到广大农民的情绪非常高涨，因此，也开始滋长着一种自满情绪。他们认为“宣传阶段”已经过去了，不需要再进行宣传教育工作。而实际上群众对办社的许多问题还不了解。这些问题不是个别的现象，如果不解决，群众思想发动就不会透，这样就会影响建社的质量。
    张德生同志在检查工作中还发现评议生产资料方面和树立贫农领导优势方面很多急待解决的问题。中共陕西省委研究了张德生同志的检查报告和各地委的报告，研究了省委派到各地帮助建社的工作人员的工作汇报，认为如果不及时解决当前发现的各项新问题，就会影响农业合作化运动健康的发展。如果要召集各地负责同志来开会也会耽误时间，因此，决定召开这次电话会议。
    省委电话会议后，各地委举行了各县委负责人员参加的电话会议。各县县委会（各区有电话设备的县份）都前后举行了各区委书记参加的电话会议，对省委的指示作了具体的布置。
    省委这次举行的电话会议正是时候。榆林地委副书记王怀仁同志说，这次电话会议的指示是十分及时的，当时榆林地区的情况是对住户集中的村庄宣传的多，对住户分散的山庄宣传的少；对青壮年宣传的多，对老年人和妇女宣传的少。榆林地区大部分是边沿区，农民住的很分散，尤其是三边地区，十里一家，八里一户，有些农民还不知道毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示。电话会议后，干部普遍注意了这个情况，分头深入偏僻的农户中用开家庭会议的形式进行宣传。这样就把运动推展到居住在偏僻地区的农民中去，把运动推前了一步。
    事实证明电话会议是实现党对群众运动及时指导的有效方法之一，通过电话会议，不仅领导上的意图可以迅速地传达下去，同时，下面有些不能解决的问题也可以及时提出来，得到解决，而且上下之间，地区之间可以及时交换意见。过去，省委召开一次地委书记联席会议贯彻执行省委的意图，需要很长时间。从省委召开地委书记联席会议，到地委召开县委书记会议，县委再召开各级干部会议，最后传达到农村，离省委最近的，交通条件最方便的渭南、宝鸡专区也需要十天以上的时间。至于那些边远的地区需要的时间更长了。比如安康地委派人到省委开会，来回需要十几天，往往是别的地区已经开始传达省委的意图了，而安康地区出席会议的人还在路上。地委召开各县委书记会议，各县委书记在路上来回要走七、八天。县里开各级干部会议，参加会议的人需要三、四天才能报到，因为都是山区，有不少区离县两、三百里路。这样一来，省委的意图传达到村，起码需要一个多月的时间。现在利用电话会议的形式，最多有五天就可以传达到农村（包括山庄）。安康地区的干部都感到在这次运动中可以经常听到省委领导同志的声音，可以使上下更加通气了。在省委附近的专区，一般的也只需要两、三天的时间，省委的意图就可以下达到村，特别是那些直接参加省委电话会议的县，一般的在第二天就把省委的意图下达到农村中去。
    电话会议的好处是很多的，但是，也有它的局限性。根据陕西省委1955年11月和12月份内举行的三次电话会议来看，电话会议应该在午夜召开最好，会议时间在两小时左右为最合适，因为在这个时间内电话的传话声音比较清楚，而且这个时间不会妨碍其他地区通长途电话，电话费还可以减半。电话会议的内容只能是最紧要的几个问题，陕西省各级党委一般地都掌握了这个原则。因而，电话会议也不能代替党的一切会议。电话会议也不能代替党组织负责人员深入群众中去了解运动的情况和具体地解决问题，它只能是党委及时指导运动的有效方法之一。它能够协助党组织更好地了解下层情况，及时地解决运动中急待解决的问题。
    电话会议是通过长途电话进行的。这就需要电话局的工作人员的帮助，如由他们负责通知，并且还要长途台在会议进行中，保证线路畅通。在省委会议室应设有扩音设备。管理扩音器的同志应事先把机器调整好，并保证在会议进行中不发生故障。陕西省各地委和某些县委都有扩音设备，这样参加会议的人就可以多了（有扩音设备的地委和县委，参加电话会议的有20多人）。
    为了改进电话会议，省委还制定了一些纪律和规定。如电话会议的人员一定要提前到会，发言要有次序，参加会议的人员要保持肃静。最近，省委通知各地，在参加电话会议前，要把当前运动中最重要的情况，写成三、五百字的发言稿，在会上发言，这样就会使电话会议开得更好。
