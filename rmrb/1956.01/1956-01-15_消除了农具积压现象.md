    The grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives in Chengguan, Yanghe, Xiakou and other six areas in Xixiang County, Shaanxi Province, had a backlog of poor-quality iron farm tools. Because the supply and marketing cooperatives no longer purchased goods, local handicraft production cooperatives had to reduce production, and some even stopped work.
    In order to solve the problem of the backlog of farm tools, the supply and marketing cooperatives and the local handicraft production cooperatives negotiated a method for repairing the farm tools. The two sides stipulated that the handicraft production cooperatives would not charge repair fees for repairing the farm tools purchased by the supply and marketing cooperatives in 1955; for repairing the farm tools purchased by the supply and marketing cooperatives in 1954, the handicraft production cooperatives would only charge two-thirds of the listed price for the forging cost; the raw materials required for repairing the farm tools would be supplied by the supply and marketing cooperatives.
    After the repairs, these farm tools were well-received by the farmers. In this way, the supply and marketing cooperatives eliminated the backlog, and the handicraft production cooperatives also resumed normal production.

    消除了农具积压现象
    陕西省西乡县城关、杨河、峡口等6个基层供销社积压了大批质量很坏的铁器农具。当地手工业生产合作社因为供销社不再进货，也不得不压缩生产，有的还停了工。
    为了解决农具积压问题，供销社和当地手工业生产合作社协商了一个整修农具的办法。双方规定：修整1955年供销社向手工业生产合作社购进的农具，手工业生产合作社不要修理费；修整1954年供销社向手工业生产合作社购进的农具，手工业生产合作社只按牌价收三分之二的火钱；修理农具所需原料由供销社供给。
    经过整修以后，这些农具就受到了农民的喜爱。这样，供销社消除了积压现象，手工业生产合作社也恢复了正常生产。
