Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 4th. Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech on January 3rd at a public rally in Agra hosted by the Uttar Pradesh Committee of the Indian National Congress. Referring to the statements made by Soviet leaders on the Goa issue and the Kashmir issue, he said: "They said some very good things. I never asked them to do so. But they spoke correctly. We are certainly pleased. Our friends living in other countries do not like these words. They wrote in the newspapers: Bulganin and Khrushchev's speeches did not even make Nehru happy. The Soviet leaders expressed their opinions after due consideration and careful thought. It is foolish to think that I or any of us did not like these speeches."

Speaking on the Goa issue, Nehru said that there was only one way out: Portuguese rule over Goa must end, and Goa must be freed. He reiterated that India hoped to resolve the Goa issue and the Kashmir issue peacefully.

Referring to India's second five-year plan, Nehru said: Foreign aid is undoubtedly welcome, as long as such aid is unconditional and friendly. India will be grateful for such aid, but India does not rely on foreign aid, because it cannot provide India with the strength that can only be gained through the labor and efforts of the Indian people themselves.

　　尼赫鲁欢迎苏联领导人关于果阿等问题的讲话
    新华社新德里4日电　印度总理尼赫鲁3日在印度国大党北方省委员会主持的亚格拉公众集会上发表演说。他谈到苏联领导人发表的关于果阿问题和克什米尔问题的讲话说：“他们说了一些很好的话。我从来没有要求他们这样做。但是他们说了正确的话。我们当然很高兴。我们的住在其他国家的朋友不喜欢这些话。他们在报纸上写道：布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的讲话甚至并没有使尼赫鲁感到高兴。苏联领袖是在经过适当的考虑和仔细的思考之后表示他们的意见的。如果认为我或者我们中的任何人不喜欢这些讲话，那是愚蠢的。”
    尼赫鲁在谈到果阿问题时说，出路只有一条，那就是葡萄牙对果阿的统治必须结束，果阿必须得到自由。他重申印度希望用和平方式解决果阿问题和克什米尔问题。
    在谈到印度第二个五年计划时，尼赫鲁说：外国援助无疑地是受欢迎的，只要这种援助是不附带条件的、友好的援助。印度将感谢这样的援助，但是印度并不依赖外国的援助，因为它不能给予印度那种只有通过印度人民本身的劳动和努力才能获得的力量。
