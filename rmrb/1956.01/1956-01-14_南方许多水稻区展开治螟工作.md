Xinhua News Agency report:

    Pest control work is being widely carried out in many rice-producing provinces in the South to destroy rice roots and prevent rice stem borers. Fujian Province started earlier than in previous years, and farmers throughout the province have already destroyed rice roots in more than 8 million mu of fields, accounting for more than 60% of the area that should be destroyed. The Gannan Administrative Region and the three special districts of Ji'an, Jiujiang, and Fuzhou in Jiangxi Province have also destroyed rice roots in 5.58 million mu of fields. Farmers in Chuxian Special District, Anhui Province, in addition to destroying rice roots, are also irrigating rice fields to eliminate overwintering rice stem borers. Guangdong Province plans to control overwintering rice stem borers in 20 million mu of rice fields; a mass movement to hoe and destroy rice roots has been widely launched throughout the province.

    南方许多水稻区展开治螟工作
    南方许多产稻省份正在普遍展开毁灭稻根，防治螟虫的工作。福建省动手比往年早，全省农民已经在八百多万亩田里毁掉稻根，占应毁面积的60％以上。江西省赣南行政区和吉安、九江、抚州三个专区也已经毁灭了558万亩田的稻根。安徽省滁县专区农民除毁灭稻根外，还在稻田中灌水，以消灭过冬螟虫。广东省计划在二千万亩稻田中防治过冬螟虫；全省已经普遍展开群众性的锄毁稻根运动。  （据新华社讯）
