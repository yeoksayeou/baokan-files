Fuxin Mining Bureau has decided to complete the Ping'an Shaft and the Xinqiu Shaft ahead of schedule. The Ping'an Shaft was originally scheduled to be handed over to production in February 1958, but it has now been decided to hand it over to production eight months ahead of schedule, in May 1957. The Xinqiu Shaft was originally scheduled to be handed over to production in January 1958, but it has now been decided to hand it over to production five months ahead of schedule, in August 1957.

	After these two pairs of shafts are handed over to production ahead of schedule, the country will obtain hundreds of thousands of tons of coal more during the First Five-Year Plan, and several thousand people can be extracted in advance to support the construction of other mine shafts.

	At present, the units constructing these two pairs of shafts have decided to adopt more than ten measures to accelerate the speed of mine construction. Relevant personnel are already preparing new construction plans and construction organization designs. (Xinhua News Agency)

    阜新两个竖井将提前建成
    阜新矿务局决定提前建成平安竖井和新邱竖井。平安竖井原定1958年2月移交生产，现在决定提前八个月在1957年5月移交生产；新邱竖井原定1958年1月移交生产，现在决定提前五个月在1957年8月移交生产。
    这两对竖井提前移交生产以后，将使国家在第一个五年计划里多得到几十万吨煤炭，并且可以提前抽出几千人支援其他地方的矿井建设。
    现在，建设这两对竖井的单位，决定采取十几项措施，来加快矿井建设的速度。有关人员已经在编制新的施工计划和施工组织设计。（新华社）
