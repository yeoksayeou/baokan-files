　　The Victory of the French People
　　The democratic forces, headed by the French Communist Party, have achieved a major victory in this French election. The French Communist Party received more than 5.59 million votes and won 151 seats in the National Assembly, an increase of more than 50 seats over its existing seats. The French Communist Party remains the largest party in France. The bourgeois ruling parties in France for the past ten years have suffered defeats. This result vividly shows that the French ruling group's policies of following the United States, expanding armaments and preparing for war, and suppressing colonial people have been rejected by the broad masses of the people, and the policies of safeguarding national interests, improving people's lives, and easing international tensions have gained increasing trust and support from the masses. This victory is a victory for the French people.
　　The French general election was held under such a political situation: In France, on the one hand, the French people's forces are growing rapidly, and the French Communist Party's policy of consolidating peace, safeguarding national independence, and improving people's living standards has won popular support; on the other hand, France's policy of following the United States has repeatedly failed, its international prestige has declined, the people's living standards have declined, and the sharp contradictions within the ruling group have become increasingly apparent. Internationally, due to the strong development of international peace forces, the international situation has eased, enhancing the mood of Western European people demanding peaceful neutrality. Under this situation, the French people, with the glorious tradition of the French Revolution, certainly cannot tolerate France's policy of following the United States in creating poverty, expanding armaments, and preparing for war. In this election, more than 26 million voters participated, which is more than two million more than in the 1951 election. In many electoral districts, the number of voters reached 90% of all voters in the district. From this, it can be seen how eagerly the broad masses of the French people hope to change the country's policies. And the election results even more convincingly prove this point.
　　The French Communist Party's brilliant victory in the election is the result of its unremitting struggle for progress, peace, and national independence. Since being squeezed out of the cabinet by reactionary forces under the direction of the United States in 1947, the French Communist Party has steadfastly opposed the French pro-American group's policy of following the United States and leading France towards war and poverty, thus showing that it is the most resolute defender of the interests of the French state and people. The French Communist Party's election program of social progress and peace is its consistent policy for the past ten years. In recent years, in order to unite national patriotic forces and peace forces to fight for the implementation of this policy, the French Communist Party has advocated the establishment of a people's front. The broad masses of the French people support this proposition. The so-called government majority, fearing that the French Communist Party's prestige would become increasingly high, wanted to use early elections and the reactionary party alliance election system to reduce the strength of the French Communist Party in the parliament. However, facts have proved that the reactionaries have underestimated the strength of the French people and also underestimated the prestige of the French Communist Party among the masses. After this election, the French Communist Party greatly strengthened its position in the parliament, although the number of seats it occupies is still far from commensurate with its mass strength.
　　In sharp contrast to the victory of the French Communist Party is the serious defeat of the right-wing parties in the election. Since the 1951 election, the bourgeois parties that have participated in any government have lost their seats. Western newspapers also acknowledge that this election represents "the French people's vote of no confidence in those who have ruled the country for the past decade." However, the true significance of the French right-wing parties' failure in the election is far deeper than the above estimates. The results of the French National Assembly election, in the final analysis, reflect the bankruptcy of the United States' policy of strength. The French people's opposition to the right-wing parties' candidates is opposition to the United States' policy of splitting Europe and rearming West Germany, opposition to the United States' "Cold War" in Europe and its policy of forcing Western European countries to expand armaments and prepare for war, and opposition to its policy of creating military blocs and intensifying international tensions. The parties that lost the most votes in this election are precisely those parties that have most blatantly followed the policies of the United States in the past. Therefore, the French election greatly shocked the United States and its followers. They are "disappointed" and "frustrated." American newspapers even have to admit: "The French people have brought us a serious defeat."
　　The French pro-American faction originally attempted to use this election to reassemble a stable pro-American majority in the parliament in order to continue to implement its reactionary policies. This plan has now completely failed. It is much more difficult to form such a majority in the new parliament than in the past. Faced with this situation, some right-wing newspapers even advocate that since the parties of the government group cannot obtain a sufficient majority in the National Assembly, this parliament should be quickly dissolved, and an election system that is more conducive to controlling elections and excluding the Communist Party should be formulated in advance, such as the majority election system. This argument reflects the US ruling group's intention to further interfere in French internal affairs. American newspapers are advocating a "real reform" of the French electoral system.
　　However, those who make this proposition completely forget that only the French people are the masters of France. No foreign interference and political conspiracy can stop the great trend of the French people demanding peace and progress. The way out for France and the demands of the French people lie in changing the current policies. As the French Communist Party stated in its statement on January 3, due to the redistribution of power in the newly elected parliament, the conditions for changing policies exist. Now, as long as the unity of all left-wing forces is achieved, it can guarantee the change of French policies in accordance with the wishes of the people and the interests of the country. The French Communist Party reiterates its proposal to reach an agreement with the Socialist Party and other Republican parties to establish a "People's Front." If the Socialist Party and other left-wing parties still had doubts about the will of the French people yesterday, then today after the election should be the time for them to wake up. They have no reason not to seriously consider the solemn appeal of the French Communist Party. There is no doubt that the French people will continue to intensify the struggle to promote the realization of their desire to change policies.
　　The major victory achieved by the French democratic forces in the election has an undeniable significance for the cause of world people defending peace and striving to ease international tensions. It marks the bankruptcy of the US war policy in France and greatly encourages the people of all countries to strive for peace. The Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world heartily congratulate the French people on this victory.

### 法国人民的胜利

　　法国人民的胜利
    以法国共产党为首的民主力量在这次法国选举中取得了重大胜利。法国共产党得到了559万多张选票，在国民议会中得到了151个席位，比现有席位增加了50多席。法国共产党仍然是法国的第一大党。十年来的法国资产阶级执政党派都遭受了失败。这个结果生动地表明，法国统治集团多年以来所奉行的追随美国、扩军备战和镇压殖民地人民的政策遭到了广大人民的唾弃，维护民族利益、改善人民生活、和缓国际紧张局势的政策得到人民群众日益增强的信任和支持。这个胜利是法国人民的胜利。
    法国大选是在这样的政治形势下举行的：在法国，一方面法国人民力量迅速增长，法国共产党主张巩固和平、维护民族独立、提高人民生活水平的政策深入人心；另一方面，法国追随美国的政策不断遭到失败，它的国际威信越来越低落，人民生活水平越来越下降，统治集团内部的尖锐矛盾越来越表面化。在国际上，由于国际和平力量的强大发展，促成了国际局势的缓和，增强了西欧人民要求和平中立的情绪。在这种形势之下，有着法国大革命的光荣传统的法国人民，对于法国追随美国制造贫穷、扩军备战的政策，当然是不能忍耐的。在这次选举中，有2，600多万选民参加了投票，即比1951年选举时的选民多出了二百多万人。在许多选区里，投票者达到了全区选民的90％。从这里可以看得出，法国广大人民是如何迫切希望改变国家的政策。而选举的结果就更加令人信服地证明了这一点。
    法国共产党在选举中所取得的辉煌胜利，是它坚持不渝地为争取进步、和平和民族独立而斗争的结果。自从1947年被反动势力在美国指使下排挤出内阁以来，法国共产党一直坚定不移地反对法国亲美集团追随美国、把法国导向战争和贫困的政策，从而表明它是法国国家和人民利益的最坚决的保卫者。法国共产党所提出的社会进步与和平的竞选纲领，是它十年来的一贯政策。近年来，为了团结全国爱国力量和和平力量来为实施这种政策而斗争，法国共产党更主张建立人民阵线。法国广大人民都支持这个主张。所谓政府多数派因为害怕法国共产党的威信越来越高，本想利用提前选举和反动的政党联盟选举制度来削减法共在议会中的力量。但是，事实证明，反动派过于低估了法国人民的力量，也过于低估了法国共产党在人民群众中的威望。经过这次选举，法国共产党大大加强了它在议会中的地位，虽然它所占有的议席的数目仍然远没有同它的群众力量相称。
    同法国共产党的胜利成为强烈对照的是右翼各党派在选举中遭到严重的失败。自从1951年的选举以来，曾经参加过任何一届政府的资产阶级党派都损失了它们的议席。西方报纸也承认，这次选举，表示“法国人民已对过去十年统治这个国家的人们投了不信任票”。但是，法国右翼党派在选举中失败的真正意义，远比上述的估计要深刻得多。法国国民议会选举的结果，归根到底反映了美国实力政策的破产。法国人民反对右翼政党的候选人，就是反对美国分裂欧洲和重新武装西德的政策，反对美国在欧洲进行“冷战”和强使西欧国家扩军备战的政策，反对它的制造军事集团、加剧国际紧张局势的政策。在这次改选中丧失选票最多的，恰恰是那些过去最明目张胆地追随美国政策的那些党派。因此，法国选举使美国和它的追随者们大为震惊。它们“失望”，它们“沮丧”。美国报纸甚至不得不承认：“法国人民给我们带来了严重的失败”。
    法国亲美派本来企图通过这次选举来在议会中重新结集一个稳固的追随美国的多数派，以便继续推行它的反动政策。这种打算现在是完全落空了。在新的议会中要想形成这样一个多数派，比过去更加困难得多。面对着这种情况，有些右派报纸竟然主张：既然政府集团各党派在国民议会得不到足够的多数，就应该赶快解散这个议会，而事先订出一个更便于控制选举，排斥共产党的选举制度，例如，多数选举制。这种论调正是反映了美国统治集团企图进一步干涉法国内政的打算。美国报纸正在主张法国的选举制度进行“真正的改革”。
    但是，作这种主张的人们完全忘记了只有法国人民才是法国的主人。任何外来干涉和政治阴谋决不可能阻止法国人民要求和平和进步的伟大潮流。法国的出路和法国人民的要求在于改变现行的政策。正如法国共产党1月3日发表的声明中所指出的，由于刚刚选出的议会的力量的重新分配，改变政策的条件是存在的。现在只要一切左翼力量的团结，就能保证按照人民的愿望和国家的利益改变法国的政策。法国共产党重申它准备同社会党和其他共和党派达成协议以建立“人民阵线”的主张。如果说社会党和其他左翼政党昨天还对法国人民的意志存有怀疑，那末选举后的今天应该是它们醒悟的时候了。它们没有理由不郑重考虑法国共产党的庄严呼吁。毫无疑问，法国人民将继续加紧斗争，来促成他们要求改变政策的愿望的实现。
    法国民主力量在选举中取得的重大胜利，对于世界人民保卫和平和争取缓和国际紧张局势的事业有着不可忽视的意义。它标志着美国的战争政策在法国的破产，大大鼓舞各国人民争取和平的斗争。中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民在一道，衷心祝贺法国人民的这个胜利。
