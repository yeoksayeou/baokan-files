Jilin Makes Plans for Developing Broadcasting Stations

　　Jilin Province has made preliminary plans for the development of broadcasting in the next seven years. The plan determines that in the spring of 1956, broadcasting stations should be universally established in all 46 cities and counties in the province. By 1957, loudspeakers should be installed in every city (except Changchun), county, district, agricultural production cooperative, and residential group in the province. The number of loudspeakers will reach 80,000, more than five times the number in 1955, and the total length of the lines will reach 33,000 kilometers. From 1958 to 1962, the total number of loudspeakers in 1957 will be used as a baseline, with an annual increase of 60%. By 1962, the province will have about 1 million loudspeakers, with an average of about 10,000 loudspeakers in each city and county.

　　吉林作出发展广播站的规划
    吉林省对今后七年的广播事业作出了初步规划。规划中确定：1956年春，要在全省46个市、县中普遍建立起广播站，到1957年要在全省每个市（长春在外）、县、区、村的农业生产合作社、居民组里都安上喇叭。喇叭数将达八万个，比1955年增加五倍多，线路总长将达33，000公里。1958年到1962年，将以1957年的喇叭总数为基准，每年递增60％。到1962年时，全省将有喇叭100万个左右，平均每个市县约有一万个喇叭。
