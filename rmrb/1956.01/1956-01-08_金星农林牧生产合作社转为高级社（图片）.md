The Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative Transformed into Advanced Cooperative

The Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xigou Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, led by Li Shunda, the nationally renowned agricultural labor model, has been built into an advanced cooperative with a completely socialist nature. The cooperative held its founding meeting on December 24, 1955. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Shuming photographed.

The newly elected Management Committee of the Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative is carrying out new production planning. The second from the left is the director, Li Shunda, and the first is the deputy director, Shen Jilan.

The Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative plans to build 300 mu of river滩 [river flats] and terraced fields this winter to expand this year's planting area. This shows the members braving the severe cold to build stone dams.
