    Sichuan Province Revises Grain Production Plan
    This Year's Grain Output Will Reach the 1957 Target
    (Xinhua News Agency) Sichuan Province recently revised its 1956 grain production plan. According to the new plan, the province's total grain output this year will exceed the original 1957 grain production target by 2.7 billion jin.
    The new grain production plan was made based on the recent large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives in Sichuan Province and the vigorous implementation of effective yield-increasing measures this year. Up to now, more than 164,000 agricultural production cooperatives have been developed in Sichuan Province. The grain production increase plans of these agricultural production cooperatives are generally around 15%, with some reaching over 40%. At the same time, yield-increasing measures will be promoted throughout the province this year, changing from one harvest per year (one or two seasons) to two or three harvests per year, changing from native seeds to improved varieties, and changing low-yield fields to high-yield fields. The implementation of these measures will greatly increase grain output.

    四川省修订粮食生产计划
    今年粮食产量将达1957年指标
    据新华社讯　四川省最近修订了1956年的粮食生产计划。按照新的计划，今年全省粮食总产量将超额27亿斤完成原定1957年的粮食生产指标。
    新的粮食生产计划是根据最近四川省农业生产合作社大量发展和今年将要大力推行一些有效的增产措施而作出的。截至目前为止，四川省的农业生产合作社已经发展到164，000多个。这些农业生产合作社的粮食增产计划一般都在15％左右，多的达40％以上。同时，在全省范围内今年将推行改一年收一季、两季为一年收两季、三季，改土种为良种，改低产田地为高产田地的增产措施。这些措施实行以后，都将大大提高粮食产量。
