    Shanghai Welcomes a Great Day
    By our reporter Ji Yin
    The high tide of socialist transformation has surged into Shanghai, the city with the highest concentration of private industry and commerce in our country. Following Beijing's lead, private industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai have proposed to apply for complete conversion to joint state-private ownership within six days, i.e., by the 20th of this month. On the morning of the 15th, thunderous cheers echoed through the Tianchan Theater in Shanghai, where more than 3,000 representatives from the city's industrial and commercial circles raised their hands to pass this historically significant resolution. Representatives lined up in long queues in front of the microphones, eager to pour out their heartfelt words. Speeches continued, and letters of guarantee were sent to the rostrum. The entire committee of the Feather Duster Trade Association wrote to the presidium, reporting their determination: To welcome joint state-private ownership, committee member Wang Huanzhang is willing to invest the base of the West Factory and over 40,000 yuan in Litai Yarn Factory stocks into the enterprise; committee member Song Shibao decided to invest real estate worth 466 taels of gold into the enterprise... Rong Jiaming, a young capitalist from Good Food Company, proposed to invest a total of 16,000 yuan, including advances, government bonds, and gold, into the enterprise to welcome the city's private industry and commerce to implement joint state-private ownership. Wang Yuanxiang, a capitalist from Shiye Rubber Factory, said: "Among our colleagues, investments have recently reached more than 360,000 yuan, and I have also persuaded my father to invest 80 taels of gold he was saving for his old age into the enterprise."
    Thousands of words could not express the representatives' joy and determination. It was almost 12 o'clock, and a long line of people still waited to speak in front of the microphones, so the presidium had to ask everyone to stop speaking. Representatives who supported the spirit of the conference and wanted to accelerate the transformation could applaud in front of the podium instead of speaking. Although the representatives requesting to speak accepted this suggestion, Cai Anfu, a representative from the woodworking industry, still felt that this could not express his joy when he passed by the podium. Therefore, he took off his hat, raised his hand, and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" The whole audience responded with cheers.
    This inspiring good news quickly spread from the meeting place and caused a sensation in Shanghai. Red special editions were snatched up in the streets. Firecrackers sounded throughout the sky. Sick elderly people walked out of their sickrooms with the help of crutches; housewives who rarely left their homes flocked to the streets; industrialists and businessmen used the fastest means of transportation to spread the news. The members of the Ti Lanqiao District Federation of Industry and Commerce left the meeting at noon and immediately returned to the district excitedly to share the good news with their colleagues. For days, they had been surrounded by colleagues. Some were awakened in the middle of the night by knocks on the door and phone calls: "Director! How is it going? Is there any news?" Although these district directors were also anxious, they always thought that their industry was relatively small and that joint operation would be slower. Now, they suddenly heard this good news, and some said: "I am so happy that my heart is about to jump out." On this day, thousands of industrialists and businessmen from the cultural and educational supplies industry flocked to the trade association to apply for joint state-private ownership. Some people described it as: "The threshold of the Cultural and Educational Supplies Trade Association is about to be broken." Every table was piled high with red application forms. By the afternoon, the application forms had all been neatly stamped with bright red seals.
    The 15th was Sunday, but hundreds and thousands of people were working and meeting in government offices, factories, shops, and trade associations. To accelerate the transformation of Shanghai's private industry and commerce, they gave up their holidays. The staff of the First Bureau of Heavy Industry are arranging the production and transformation plans of the 480 mechanical and electrical factories under their jurisdiction by company, by district, and by product. The young typists in the secretariat have been working day and night for several days. In the Capital Construction Section, engineers are working with the directors of core factories to study technical transformation measures in conjunction with the transformation plan. Cadres of the Joint Venture Office are receiving the reporting teams at the door all day long.
    The Shanghai working class welcomes the patriotic actions of Shanghai capitalists in demanding to accelerate the road to socialism. On the 17th, 14,000 worker representatives held a representative meeting and then held a parade. The workers in private enterprises are busy cutting out paper cuttings of the Chinese character for "happiness," tying colored lanterns, and rushing to handle major happy events; at the same time, they are putting in their best efforts to improve production and business. The entire staff of the mechanical workshop of Yi Sheng Rubber Factory worked overnight to successfully manufacture a compression machine to remove impurities from raw rubber. They guaranteed to reduce the defective rate of rubber shoes from 1.5% to 1%. The workers of the open-hearth furnace section of Qian Yongji Smelting Factory created the latest record. It used to take 12 hours to produce a furnace of lead, but now it has been reduced to 4 hours and 35 minutes. Every worker at Qian Yongji Electric Motor Factory made a guarantee to reduce the reject rate from 4% to 1.5%. More than 2,000 employees of private enterprises in Huangpu District have formed more than 100 youth shock brigades and have already been put into the transformation work of private industry and commerce.
    Tens of thousands of family members of private industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai have also taken action. Mao Yunzhen, the wife of Wu Guocheng, manager of Wu Liangcai Opticians, had been looking forward to the joint state-private ownership of the enterprise for two months. At the Shanghai Municipal Industrial and Commercial Circles Temporary Representative Meeting, she tried several times to squeeze to the front to speak, but there were too many people speaking and she had no chance. She had already discussed with her husband and decided to take out her private savings of 7,000 yuan and invest it in the enterprise. Wang Zhixue, the wife of Jiang Guanhua, manager of Zhongxi Printing Factory, encouraged her husband not to withdraw the 16,000 yuan advance, but to use it as an investment in the enterprise. Lang Jifang, the wife of Wang Qizhuo, director of Xuhui District Shengji Pharmaceutical Factory, issued a challenge letter at the conference. She said that in addition to helping her husband do a good job in both production and joint venture, she also guarantees to trial-produce 5 new products in 1956 as a gift to the motherland after the joint venture.
    The great day of the complete implementation of joint state-private ownership in Shanghai's private industry and commerce is getting closer and closer. The people of the city are welcoming the arrival of this great day with unparalleled excitement. As we are writing this manuscript, a parade of more than 10,000 workers is advancing outside the window. In a forest of red flags, countless letters of guarantee are reflected. The deafening sound of firecrackers, gongs, drums, and cheers is shaking Shanghai. The 6 million people of Shanghai are determined to follow the capital Beijing into a happy socialist society.

    上海迎接大喜日
    本报记者　季音
    社会主义改造的高潮，已经汹涌澎湃地来到了我国私营工商业最集中的上海市。上海市私营工商业者步北京之后，提出要在6天内，即本月20日全部申请实行公私合营。15日上午，上海天蟾舞台里欢声雷动，来自全市的3，000多位工商界代表，就在这里举手通过了这个有历史意义的决议。代表们在扩音机前排成了长长的行列，要求倾吐自己的心腹之言。代表们的发言继续着，一份份保证书送上主席台。飞花整理业同业公会全体委员写信给主席团，报告自己的决心：为了迎接公私合营，委员王焕章愿将西厂的基地、利泰纱厂股票4万多元一并投入企业；委员宋世宝决定将价值466两黄金的房地产投入企业……。好吃来公司青年资本家戎嘉明提出要把垫款、公债、黄金等共16，000元，投入企业迎接全市私营工商业实行公私合营。实业橡胶厂资方王源祥说：“我们同业中，最近投资的已经有36万多元，我也动员父亲把防老用的80两黄金，投入企业了。”
    千言万语，道不尽代表们的喜悦和决心。快12点了，扩音机前还排着等待发言的长长的队伍，以致主席团不得不要求大家停止发言，要发言的代表们如果都拥护大会精神，要求加速改造，可以在发言台前鼓掌表示一下，就不要发言了。这个意见虽然被要求发言的代表们接受，但是，车木业代表蔡安甫从发言台前经过的时候，仍然觉得这样不能表达自己的喜悦，因此，他脱下帽子，举手高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”全场跟着就响起了一片欢呼声。
    这个振奋人心的喜讯，迅速地从会场传了出去，轰动了上海市。红色的号外在街上被人们抢夺一空。鞭炮声响彻了云霄。有病的老人扶着拐杖走出了病室；足不出户的家庭妇女们拥到了马路上；工商业者利用了最快的交通工具，四处奔走相告。提篮桥区工商联的委员们中午离开了会场，立刻兴奋地回到区里，召开了紧急会议，向同业们道喜。他们多少天来天天被同业们包围着。有人在半夜里也被敲门来访的人和电话吵醒：“主任啊！怎么样啊？有消息没有？”这些区主任虽然也急，但是总认为他们行业比较小，合营总要慢些。现在，他们突然听到了这喜讯，有的说：“我乐的心都要跳出来了。”这天全天，上千个文教用品业的工商业者川流不息地到同业公会，提出申请公私合营。有人形容说：
  “文教用品同业公会的门槛都快要被挤破了。”每一个台子上都堆满了红色的申请书。到了下午，申请书上都已端端正正地盖上了朱红色的图章。
    15日是星期日，但是成千成百的人在机关、工厂、商店，同业公会里工作和开会。为了加速上海私营工商业的改造，他们放弃了休假。第一重工业局的工作人员，正在按公司、按区、按产品，排了一个队，把所属480个机电厂的生产和改造的规划搞出来。秘书科年青的打字员已经好几天日夜赶工作。在基建科，工程师正和核心厂的厂长结合改造方案研究技术改造措施。合营处的干部，整天在门口接待报喜队。
    上海工人阶级欢迎上海资本家要求加速走社会主义道路的爱国行动。17日，14，000工人代表举行了代表会议，会后并且举行了游行。私营企业的工人们一面忙着剪喜字、扎彩灯，赶办大喜事；一面拿出最大的劲头来搞好生产和业务。义生橡胶厂机械车间全体工人连夜赶制成功了一部压缩车，用来清除生胶中的杂质。他们保证要把胶鞋的次品率，从1.5％降低到1％。开元镕炼厂平炉部工人创造了最新纪录，原来要12小时出一炉铅，现在缩减到4点35分就出一炉。钱镛记电机厂每个工人都订了保证，要把废品率从4％降低到1.5％。黄浦区私营企业的2000多职工，组成了100多个青年突击队，已经投入了私营工商业改造工作。
    上海数以万计的私营工商业者的家属们也行动起来了。吴良材眼镜公司经理吴国城的爱人毛韫珍盼望企业公私合营已经盼了两个月了。在上海市工商界临时代表会议上，她几次想挤到台前去讲话，但是都因讲话的人太多而没有机会。她已经和丈夫商量好，决心把私蓄7，000元拿出来投入企业。中西印刷厂经理蒋冠华的爱人王志学，鼓励丈夫不再抽回16，000元垫款，而把它作为企业投资。徐汇区生机药物厂厂长王其灼的爱人郎继芳，在大会上提出了挑战书。她说，我除协助丈夫做好生产合营两不误外，并且保证在1956年内试制5种新产品，作为合营后对祖国的献礼。
    上海私营工商业全部实行公私合营的大喜日越来越近了，全市人民以无比的兴奋在迎接这个大喜日的来临。当我们在写这篇稿子的时候，1万多工人的游行队伍正在窗外前进。在一片森林似的红旗里，掩映着数不清的保证书。震耳欲聋的鞭炮声，锣鼓声、欢呼声震撼着上海。上海600多万人民决心紧跟着首都北京走进幸福的社会主义社会。（附图片）
