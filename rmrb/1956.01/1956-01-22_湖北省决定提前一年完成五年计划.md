Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 21st: The Third Session of the First People's Congress of Hubei Province, which closed today, decided to strive to complete the province's first Five-Year Plan in four years, one year ahead of schedule.

    Zhang Tixue, Deputy Governor of Hubei Province, in his report to the congress, requested that the total output of grain and cotton in the province this year exceed the targets for the final year of the Five-Year Plan; the output of oil crops, ramie, tea, silkworm cocoons, aquatic products, afforestation, and pig raising should reach or exceed the targets for the final year of the Five-Year Plan this year; cattle raising should reach more than 90% of the target for the final year; local industry, commerce, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings should also reach or greatly exceed the development level of the final year of the Five-Year Plan; basic construction and transportation industries are required to complete the first Five-Year Plan six months ahead of schedule. The five-year plans for various socialist transformation undertakings should be completed or overfulfilled in four years.

    During the discussions, the representatives used many facts to prove that it is possible to complete the province's first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Taking grain as an example, according to statistics from the Xiaogan Special District alone, after production planning, the entire special district is expected to have 8 high-yield areas producing 1,000 jin per mu, 275 high-yield townships producing 1,000 jin per mu, and 1,988 high-yield cooperatives producing 1,000 jin per mu this year, and they will generally increase production by 50% to 100% compared to last year. The total grain output of the province this year only needs to increase by more than 14% compared to last year to reach the level of the final year of the Five-Year Plan.

    After six days of discussion, the conference unanimously adopted the resolution to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. The representatives expressed their determination to strive to achieve this task.

    湖北省决定提前一年完成五年计划
    据新华社武汉21日电　今天闭幕的湖北省第一届人民代表大会第三次会议，决定争取在4年内提前完成全省的第一个五年计划。
    湖北省副省长张体学在向大会提出的报告中，要求今年全省粮食和棉花的总产量超过五年计划最后一年的指标；油料作物、苎麻、茶叶、蚕茧、水产、造林和养猪等，今年都要达到或超过五年计划最后一年的指标；养牛要达到最后一年指标的90％以上；地方工业、商业和文教卫生事业也要达到或大大超过五年计划最后一年的发展水平；基本建设和交通运输业要求提前半年完成第一个五年计划。各项社会主义改造事业的五年计划都要在4年内完成或超额完成。
    代表们在讨论中用许多事实证明提前完成全省第一个五年计划是可以实现的。以粮食为例，仅据孝感专区的统计，经过生产规划以后，全专区预计在今年内将出现8个千斤丰产区、275个千斤丰产乡、1，988个千斤丰产社，它们一般都将比去年增产50％到一倍以上。而全省今年的粮食总产量只需要比去年增产14％多就可以达到五年计划最后一年的水平。
    会议经过6天的讨论以后，一致通过了4年完成五年计划的决议，代表们纷纷表示要为实现这个任务而奋斗。
