    The Yugoslav People We Saw
    Wang Yi, Wang Xi

    I

    During the 25 days that the Chinese journalists' delegation spent in Yugoslavia, we visited 5 of the 6 republics, more than a dozen cities, and many factories, museums, and farms. The journey covered no less than several thousand kilometers.

    Wherever we went, our gracious hosts would always say with some apology, "You've come a little late; if it were summer, you would see the best scenery." In fact, winter is not very severe for this country. The resort city of Dubrovnik, with its subtropical climate, has tall, lush palm trees and agave plants lining the streets, enveloping the entire city in a verdant green all year round, making one feel relaxed and happy. The beautiful Lake Bled, nestled high in the mountains and known as "the eye of the mountains," loses none of its blue charm in the November sunlight. In the valleys and plains of northern Serbia and Croatia, the autumn harvest is over, and delicate farmhouses with pointed tile roofs are interspersed with vineyards laden with vines and orchards stretching as far as the eye can see. Winter cannot steal the grandeur and beauty of Yugoslavia's mountains and rivers.

    The beautiful and rich land of Yugoslavia has suffered countless tramplings by foreign invaders for centuries. We strolled by Lake Ohrid in western Macedonia, where an ancient story is passed down through generations among the various ethnic groups of Yugoslavia: a fairy on the lake gave a young farmer named Marko a sword of invincibility and a magic flower, enabling him to defeat the invading Turkish emperor who had stolen his glorious life and rescue his beloved girl, Biljana. This story, intertwined with hatred of foreign aggression and longing for a better life, is not a legend but a historical reality.

    Marko is the image of a national hero whom the people look up to in times of suffering. Poems of resistance against aggression fill the history of the various ethnic groups. In the 1560s, Matija Gubec, a Croat, led a large-scale peasant uprising against the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The uprising failed, and Matija Gubec was forced to wear a red-hot iron crown by the tyrant, dying unyielding. In the early 19th century, the Serbian uprising against Turkish occupation, led by Karađorđe, lasted for nine years. The stone coffin and tombstone of Goce Delchev, the hero who led the Macedonian uprising in the late 19th century, are still preserved in the courtyard of an underground church in Skopje for people to admire...

    During World War II, the Yugoslav people's struggle against German and Italian fascism was particularly arduous. Yugoslav comrades told us that during the war, on average, one out of every eight people was a guerrilla fighter, and one out of every nine was a war casualty. Almost everyone we met over the age of 30 had participated in the struggle against the fascist occupiers; and it was not uncommon to find entire families who were guerrilla fighters.

    II

    The car traveled at a slow speed on the winding 80-kilometer road from Kilicha to Sarajevo. This is the heartland of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the command headquarters of the anti-fascist guerrilla war was stationed for most of the time.

    Before entering the Sarajevo basin, we arrived at the foot of Mount Igman. Under two large trees in a mountain depression stands a monument commemorating the first "Proletarian Brigade" of the People's Guerrilla Army in a forced march in January 1942. The red star on the monument is inlaid with an axe and sickle – the emblem of the "Proletarian Brigade." The inscription reads: The soldiers, dressed in thin and ragged clothes, crossed mountain after mountain in the severe cold of minus 32 degrees Celsius, to reach the other side of Mount Igman to meet the enemy. They marched continuously for 23 hours, and before reaching their destination, 180 soldiers froze to death or became frostbitten along the way... The monument and its surroundings are very simple, but, like many such monuments we saw elsewhere, they show that the Yugoslav government and people are striving to preserve various wartime relics and use them to educate the second generation.

    Together with our Yugoslav comrades, we paid our respects at the "Draga Mass Grave," not far from Ljubljana. This is a large cemetery surrounded by a stone wall on the mountainside. A clear stream flows beside the mountain. The fascists lined up the captured political workers and wounded soldiers of the Slovenian guerrilla army along the stone wall and carried out brutal mass executions. Within a few years, 8,000 patriotic people were killed at this site. Blood stained the flowing water red, but the Slovenian people followed in the bloodstained footsteps of the dead and fought to the end. Now, countless wreaths and bouquets constantly accompany the heroic spirits of the martyrs in front of the tomb. The tombstone reads: "Although the mountains and rivers are quiet, the victims accuse the murderers." The famous sculptor vividly reproduced the hatred, distress, and unyielding spirit of the victims before their execution.

    Patriotism and heroism are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. We can often hear and see songs, sculptures, and paintings praising national heroes, which have become the most moving themes of Yugoslav realist art everywhere, even in the most remote corners. People told us that every Sunday or holiday, there is a constant stream of Young Pioneers and middle and university students visiting the martyrs' monuments and memorial halls everywhere. We saw that in front of the memorial tombstones, whether large or small, famous or unknown heroes' tombs, there are often flowers surrounding them in the winter season. In the rural areas of Vojvodina Autonomous Province, many farmers still reluctantly discard the small red star caps worn by guerrilla fighters more than a decade ago.

    III

    The arduous life and tenacious struggle left Yugoslavia with its most valuable asset – cadres who have been tested. We have asked many people about their life experiences. From the chairman of the Republic's Executive Committee to the head of the commune (grassroots political organization), from the factory director to the chairman of the rural cooperative, from the newspaper editor to the president of the agency... almost everyone's experience is inseparable from the guerrilla war.

    In the port of Rijeka, we visited Yugoslavia's largest shipyard, the "May 3rd" Shipyard. Comrade Juli, the director of this factory, was once a guerrilla fighter. Juli is only 36 years old this year. He is the son of a working-class family, studied mechanics, and worked on the railway. As soon as the war began, he joined the guerrilla army. He was imprisoned in a German concentration camp, and after escaping from prison life, he returned to the guerrilla army. He told us: "The guerrilla army often fought on the islands in southwestern Yugoslavia. From then on, I began to have a close relationship with ships." He smiled and said, "Of course, the guerrilla army only had wooden boats at that time. In 1944, I was the company commander of the guerrilla army and was responsible for repairing wooden boats. Because of this relationship, I was assigned to work in this factory after the war."

    We also talked with Mirša Grbo, a technician at this factory, about his life experience. Like many young people, he was still a child before the war. His father's arrest and imprisonment for participating in revolutionary activities made his young heart mature early. During the war, he participated in youth organizations and did underground work, and was soon arrested by the enemy. He was not liberated until the end of the war. He worked in several other factories, studying in his spare time while working, and became an excellent technician.

    These "home-grown" cadres generally have close ties with the masses. In Ljubljana, we spent two days with Comrade Tom Brez, chairman of the Slovenian Republic's Journalists Association, member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and member of the Central Committee of the Republic's League. In the anti-fascist war, he led the people's guerrilla war in the suburbs of Ljubljana as the secretary of the Provincial Party Committee. When we were with him, whether it was the mayor, the factory director, or ordinary employees and hotel receptionists, they all greeted him like an old friend. He commanded his driver, Franz, like a commander issuing orders: "Franz, turn on the radio!" "Franz, slow down!" The young and agile Franz silently and accurately carried out his instructions. Once, when the car suddenly braked and his body unexpectedly leaned forward, he gently dusted the dust off Franz's shoulders with his large hand, and his movements were as tender as a mother.

    IV

    The people of all ethnic groups in Yugoslavia, who have achieved independence and freedom, deeply know the precious significance of national independence. Yugoslavia achieved national independence after the war. We have visited department stores in Belgrade and other cities. The showcases and shelves are mainly filled with their own products. The factories are the property of the Yugoslav people themselves. One Yugoslav journalist told us: One or two reporters from American newspapers are also stationed in Yugoslavia. What do they report? "They are not interested in our ongoing construction and life. Perhaps only our seaside sanatoriums and scenic spots can arouse their interest in writing."

    The people of all ethnic groups in Yugoslavia are proud people. As we drove from the Postojna Cave to Ljubljana, dusk had fallen. With the help of the car lights and the bright road signs, we could see that this was not a bad road. The comrade accompanying us told us: Part of this road was built by the Italian occupiers. They built the road to the edge of the occupied area and said proudly: Let it stop here, and let the rest retain "Balkan civilization." However, this comrade said, "After the war, we used the best technology to repair this section ourselves. After all, we let Balkan civilization surpass the civilization of Italian fascism." His slightly excited tone was filled with contempt for the enemy and pride in the creation of his own people. The feeling of loving the motherland and everything of one's own nation can be strongly felt. Here, let me record a small event: In foggy Ljubljana, it is almost impossible to see people across the street before noon every day. However, the local staff boasted about their city in such a way that he especially introduced us, "A tourist from London, the world-famous fog city, originally planned to stay for only one day, but he was fascinated by our fog, reluctant to leave, and stayed for another day or two..."

    我们看到的南斯拉夫人民
    王揖　汪溪
    一
    中国新闻工作者代表团在南斯拉夫的25天中，访问了6个共和国中的5个，访问了十几个城市，参观了很多工厂、博物馆和农庄。经历的旅程不下几千公里。
    不管走到那里，殷勤好客的主人总是带着一些歉意对我们说：“你们来得迟了一些，如果是在夏天啊，就会见到最好的景色。”其实，冬天对于这个国家并不是很严峻的。有着亚热带气候的游览胜地杜布罗夫尼克城，街道两旁高大繁茂的棕榈树和龙舌兰的枝叶，终年都使整个城市笼罩在一片翠绿中，让人心旷神怡。位在高山之中以“山上的眼睛”闻名的优美的布列德湖，在11月的阳光里丝毫不减它那蓝色的妩媚。已经结束了秋收的北部塞尔维亚和克罗地亚的谿谷和平原上，尖形瓦顶的精致农舍间，点缀着藤条累累的葡萄园和成片的果树。冬天并不能夺去南斯拉夫山河的雄姿和秀色。
    南斯拉夫美丽富饶的国土，几百年来，遭受过说不尽的异族的践踏。我们曾在马其顿共和国西部的昂里德湖边漫步，有一个关于它的古老故事在南斯拉夫各民族人民中世世代代传述着：湖上的仙女将一把所向无敌的宝剑和一朵魔花送给热望自由和幸福的青年农民马可，使他打败了夺去了他光彩的生活的入侵者——土耳其帝王，救出了心爱的姑娘毕丽雅纳。这个交织着对外来侵略的仇恨和对美好生活的向往的故事，不是传奇，而是历史的真实。
    马可正是在苦难中的人民仰望着的民族英雄的形象。反抗侵略的诗篇载满了各族人民的历史。16世纪60年代，克罗地亚人马蒂亚·古柏领导了反对奥匈王朝统治的规模巨大的农民暴动。暴动失败了，马蒂亚·古柏被暴君戴上了烧得通红的铁帽子，死而不屈。19世纪初叶，塞尔维亚人反抗土耳其占领的起义在卡拉约尔耶领导下坚持了9年。19世纪末叶领导马其顿人起义的英雄盖尔切布的石棺和墓碑，今天还保存在斯科普里一个地下教堂的庭院里供人瞻仰……。
    第二次世界大战期间，南斯拉夫人民反抗德意法西斯的斗争尤其艰巨。南斯拉夫的同志们告诉我们：战时，平均每8个人里有一个游击队员，每9个人里有一个战争牺牲者。我们遇见的年在30岁以上的人，几乎没有一个不曾参加反法西斯占领者的斗争；而全家都是游击队员的，也屡见不鲜。
    二
    汽车以不快的速度，行驶在从基里查到萨拉热窝蜿蜒80公里的公路上。这正是波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维那共和国的心脏地带，反法西斯游击战争的指挥部大部时间是驻在这里的。
    在进入萨拉热窝盆地以前，我们到达了伊格曼山脚下。在一个山凹里的两棵大树下，树立着纪念人民游击队的第一个“无产阶级旅”在1942年1月的一次急行军的纪念碑。碑上的红星里镶着斧头和镰刀——“无产阶级旅”的徽号。碑文写道：战士们在零下32度的严寒里，穿着单薄褴褛的服装，越过一座又一座高山，要赶到伊格曼山的那一边去迎击敌人。他们连续行军23小时，在到达目的地以前，沿途有180个战士冻死冻僵了……。这个纪念碑及其周围的布置都十分简朴，但是，正像我们在其它地方看到的很多的这样的纪念碑一样地说明，南斯拉夫政府和人民是努力保存各种战斗遗迹，并用此来教育第二代。
    我们同南斯拉夫同志一起凭吊了离卢布尔雅那不算远的“得拉加合葬墓”。这是在山腰上用一道石墙围绕着的很大的一个公墓。山旁流着清澈的溪水。法西斯把被俘的斯洛文尼亚游击队的政治工作人员和伤病员，顺着石墙排成队，进行野蛮的集体枪杀。几年之内，在这个地点前后被难的爱国志士有8，000人。鲜血染红了流水，但是，斯洛文尼亚人民踏着死者的血迹，一直战斗到底。现在，墓前无数的花圈和花束常年不断地陪伴着烈士的英灵。墓碑上写着：“虽然山河静谧，但被难者在控诉凶手”。有名的雕塑家把死难者临刑前的仇恨、困顿和不屈如生地复现了出来。
    爱国主义和英雄主义的教育是深入人心的。我们经常可以听到和看到歌颂民族英雄的歌曲、雕塑、绘画，即使在最偏僻的角落里也到处成为南斯拉夫现实主义艺术最动人的主题。人们告诉我们，每逢星期日或假日，各处的烈士纪念碑和纪念馆，总有川流不息的少先队员和中学大学学生，前往参观凭吊。我们看到：在纪念墓碑前，不管是大是小，是有名或无名的英雄之墓，在冬天季节里，常有鲜花环绕着。在伏伊伏丁那自治省的农村里，还有不少农民至今仍舍不得抛掉十几年前游击队员们戴的红五星小帽。
    三
    艰苦的生活，顽强的战斗给南斯拉夫留下了最宝贵的财产——经过考验的干部。我们曾问过许多人的生活经历。从共和国执委会主席到公社（基层政权机构）负责人，从工厂厂长到农村合作社的主席，从报纸编辑到社长……几乎每个人的经历，都同游击战争分不开。
    在里耶卡港，我们参观了南斯拉夫最大的造船厂——“五三”造船厂。这个工厂的厂长尤利同志，从前就是一个游击战士。尤利今年只有36岁。他是工人家庭的儿子，曾学过机械，也在铁路上工作过。战争一开始，他就参加了游击队。他曾被关在德国集中营里，在逃脱了囚犯生活之后，他又回到游击队里。他告诉我们：“游击队经常在我国西南部的海岛上作战。从那时我就开始和船发生了血肉的关系。”他笑了笑说，“当然，那时候游击队只有木船。1944年，我是游击队的连长，并担任了修理木船的工作。也就是因为这个关系，战后我就被分派到本厂来工作。”
    我们也同这个厂的技术工人米尔沙格布罗谈过他的生活经历。像许多年轻人一样，战前，他还是个孩子。因为父亲参加革命活动被捕入狱，使他幼小的心灵早熟了。战争期间，他参加了青年组织做地下工作，不久就被敌人逮捕。一直到战争结束，他才被解放出来。他在其他几个工厂工作过，一面工作，一面进业余学校学习，成了优秀的技术工人。
    这些“土生土长”的干部，一般地同群众都有密切的联系。在卢布尔雅那，我们曾同斯洛文尼亚共和国的记者协会主席、南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央监察委员、共和国联盟中央委员会委员托姆·布列兹同志相处了两天。在反法西斯战争中，他以省委书记的身份，在卢布尔雅那近郊领导了人民的游击战争。我们同他在一起的时候，不管是市长，厂长，或是普通的职员和旅馆的招待员，见到他都像会到老朋友一样亲热。他指挥他的司机弗兰兹像个司令员在发布命令：“弗兰兹，把收音机打开！”“弗兰兹，速度放得慢一些！”年轻敏捷的弗兰兹一声不响地准确地执行他的吩咐。有一次当汽车突然刹住，他的身子出其不意地向前倾时，他用肥大的手，轻轻地替弗兰兹拂掸掉肩上的灰尘，这时他的动作竟温存得像个母亲。
    四
    取得了独立自由的南斯拉夫各族人民，是深深知道国家独立的宝贵意义的。南斯拉夫在战后实现了国家独立。我们参观过贝尔格莱德和其他城市的百货商店。橱窗和货架上主要的是他们自己的产品。工厂是南斯拉夫人民自己的财产。有一个南斯拉夫记者告诉我们：美国报纸也有一两个记者常驻在南斯拉夫。他们报道些什么呢？“他们对我们正在进行的建设和生活是不感兴趣的。也许只有我们的海滨疗养所和风景区还能引起他们动笔的兴致。”
    南斯拉夫各族人民是自豪的人民。我们从波斯托伊那山洞向卢布尔雅那驶去时，暮色已深。借着汽车的灯光和路上发亮的指路标，可以看出这是一条不坏的公路。伴我们同行的同志告诉我们：这段公路有一部分是意大利占领者修建的。他们把公路一直修到占领区的边缘。骄傲地说：修到此为止吧，其余的让它保留着“巴尔干文明”吧。可是，这位同志说，“战后，我们自己用最好的技术修了这一段。我们毕竟让巴尔干文明赛过了意大利法西斯的文明”。他那略带激动的声调里，荡漾着对敌人的蔑视，对自己人民的创造的自豪。人们热爱祖国，热爱自己民族的一切的心情，是可以强烈地感到的，这里不妨记述一件小事：在多雾的卢布尔雅那，几乎每天午刻以前的街道上对面不见人。但是当地的工作人员是那样地夸称自己的城市，他特意向我们介绍说，“有一个从世界闻名的雾城伦敦来的旅客，本打算只住一天的，但是他被我们的雾迷住了，舍不得走，又多留了一两天……。”
