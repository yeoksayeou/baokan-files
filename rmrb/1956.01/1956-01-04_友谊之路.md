　　Road of Friendship
    The Jining-Ulan Bator railway on the Sino-Mongolian border has been connected and opened to traffic. From now on, our country has a new international railway transport line, which is a major event in our socialist construction.
    In order to strengthen the economic and cultural ties between the three countries, the governments of China, the Soviet Union, and the Mongolian People's Republic signed an agreement on September 15, 1952, to build a railway from Jining in China to Ulan Bator in the Mongolian People's Republic, which will connect with the railway from Ulan Bator to the Soviet Union. The section of the railway from Jining via Erenhot to the Chinese border, which is 338.7 kilometers long, was built by our country and started in May 1953. With the support of the people of the whole country and the direct participation of the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, thanks to the heroic labor of railway construction workers and technicians, the track-laying task of this railway was completed on December 11, 1954, 14 days ahead of the original plan; in 1955, projects such as building station lines, installing machinery, and constructing houses were completed successively. On November 27, 1955, it was completed and accepted by the State Acceptance and Handover Committee of the State Council, and was officially delivered to the state for use on December 1, completing all construction tasks according to the completion date stipulated in the contract signed by China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia.
    The completion of the Jining-Erenhot railway with various modern equipment and the beginning of international through transport will further strengthen the economic and cultural cooperation between our country and the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and other fraternal countries in Eastern Europe, and is of great significance for accelerating our country's socialist construction. During the period of restoring the national economy and building socialism, our country has received and will continue to receive assistance from the fraternal countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Our great ally, the Soviet Union, often provides our country with various valuable technical materials, uses the most advanced technological achievements to design many important projects for our country, manufactures the latest equipment for our country, sends experts to help our country carry out construction, and cultivates various technical talents for us in the Soviet Union. These assistances have become one of the decisive factors for rapidly completing our country's socialist construction. In the past, the traffic lines for economic and cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries mainly relied on the railway via Harbin and Manchuria to Moscow; after the completion of the Jining-Erenhot line, the distance from Beijing via Ulan Bator to Moscow is 1,100 kilometers shorter than the previous route. This shows that the distance of railway transportation among China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia will be greatly shortened in the future. In the future, our country can use this route to import large quantities of industrial equipment and materials from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries with less transportation costs, shorter time, and faster speed, especially the equipment and materials required for key projects, which is one of the important conditions for accelerating the completion of our country's socialist industrialization.
    It is particularly worth mentioning that the beginning of the Sino-Soviet-Mongolian international through transport is a sign of further strengthening the friendly cooperation among our three fraternal countries. People call the Jining-Ulan Bator-Moscow railway the Road of Friendship, which fully reflects the unbreakable brotherly friendship between our three countries.
    The Jining-Erenhot railway is in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and its completion will bring more prosperity and happiness to the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is located in the northern border of our country. Transportation is inconvenient, and it is difficult to export agricultural and livestock products and import various industrial products. This backward state of transportation has to some extent hindered the economic development of this region. The opening of the Jining-Erenhot railway will greatly change this situation. Along the railway line, new towns and new highways have appeared in places that were once uninhabited, and the original cities are more prosperous than before. For example, from October 1954 to April 1955, more than 116,000 kilograms of industrial products were transported from Tumurt railway station to the farmers and herdsmen of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the freight rate was reduced from 65 yuan per ton when using carts and manual labor in the past to 8 yuan. Thanks to the railway, transportation is convenient. The Sunite Right Banner Supply and Marketing Cooperative north of Wondoormiao purchased a large amount of various agricultural and livestock products from January 1954 to October 1955, and also purchased 300,000 jin of cattle and sheep bones that farmers and herdsmen had discarded in the past because they could not be transported. Because the train transported a large amount of building materials to the grassland, many farmers and herdsmen built new houses and improved their living conditions. During the construction of the Jining-Erenhot line, it was built and used simultaneously. In addition to supplying the materials needed for the railway, from December 1953 to November 1955, it transported more than 425,000 passengers and more than 188,000 tons of various goods. Now, trains are continuously transporting agricultural and livestock products from the grassland, and transporting industrial construction materials, agricultural machinery, pesticides, and daily necessities into the grassland. Obviously, this is of great benefit to the construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    After more than two years of arduous and outstanding labor on the grassland and desert at an altitude of 1,500 meters above sea level, the Jining-Erenhot railway with modern equipment has finally been successfully built! Now, the task facing the railway department is to strive to manage this railway well. In particular, all leading staff, workers, technicians, and staff of the Jining Transportation Sub-bureau of the Taiyuan Railway Administration must make a hundred times more efforts, actively learn from the experience of Soviet railway transportation, and promote the various advanced experiences that our country's railways already have and are effective, so that this railway can become a railway with a large transportation capacity, more loading, faster running, and low transportation costs, ensuring the completion and early completion of the 1956 transportation plan, so that this Road of Friendship can play a major role in strengthening international cooperation and supporting the glorious cause of our country's socialist construction.

　　友谊之路
    集宁—乌兰巴托铁路中、蒙边境铁路接轨通车了。从今以后，我国又有了一条新的国际铁路运输干线，这是我国社会主义建设中的一件大事。
    我国政府、苏联政府和蒙古人民共和国政府，为了加强三国相互间的经济和文化的联系，在1952年9月15日签订了协定，修建从我国集宁到蒙古人民共和国乌兰巴托的铁路，这条铁路将同从乌兰巴托到苏联的铁路接通。从集宁经二连到我国边境的这段铁路，全长338.7公里，由我国负责修建，于1953年5月间动工。在全国人民支援和内蒙古自治区人民的直接参加下，由于铁路建筑工人、技术人员的英勇劳动，这条铁路到1954年12月11日止，比原计划提前14天完成了铺轨任务；1955年又相继完成了修筑站线、安装机械、建造房屋等工程。1955年11月27日，经国务院国家验收交接委员会验收完毕，12月1日正式交付国家使用，按中、苏、蒙三国签订合同规定的竣工日期完成了全部建筑任务。
    具有各种现代设备的集宁—二连铁路的建成和国际联运的开始，将会进一步加强我国同苏联、蒙古和东欧其他各兄弟国家的经济、文化合作，对于加速我国社会主义建设具有重要的意义。我国在恢复国民经济和建设社会主义的期间，已经得到并且要继续得到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的援助。我们伟大的盟邦苏联经常供给我国各种宝贵的技术资料，用最先进的技术成就为我国设计许多重要的工程，为我国制造最新型的设备，派出专家帮助我国进行建设，在苏联国内为我们培养各种技术人材。这些援助，已成为迅速完成我国社会主义建设的决定性的因素之一。过去，中苏两国间和其他兄弟国家间的经济、文化往来的交通线路，主要是依靠经哈尔滨、满洲里到莫斯科的铁路；集二线建成以后，由北京经乌兰巴托到莫斯科，比前面的那条路近1，100公里。这就表明今后中、苏、蒙三国铁路运输的距离大大缩短了。今后，我国可以通过这条路，用比以前少的运输费用、较短的时间、较快的速度，从苏联以及其他兄弟国家大量输入工业设备和材料，特别是各项重点工程所需要的设备和材料，这正是目前加速完成我国社会主义工业化的重要条件之一。
    特别值得提出的是中、苏、蒙国际联运的开始是我们三个兄弟国家之间友好合作进一步加强的标志。人们把集宁—乌兰巴托—莫斯科铁路叫做友谊之路，充分体现了我们三个国家之间牢不可破的兄弟般的友好关系。
    集二铁路在内蒙古自治区境内，它的建成将给内蒙古自治区人民带来更多的繁荣和幸福。内蒙古自治区在我国北部边疆，交通不便，农、畜产品的输出和各种工业品的输入很困难。这种交通落后的状态，曾在一定程度上阻碍了这个地区经济的发展。集二铁路的通车，就要大大改变这个面貌。在铁路沿线，过去渺无人烟的地方出现了新的城镇、新的公路线，原有的城市都比过去更繁荣了。例如，从1954年10月到1955年4月有116，000多公斤的工业品由土牧尔台车站运到内蒙古自治区的农、牧民手中，运价由过去用大车和人力运输时每吨65元降到8元。由于有了铁路，交通方便了，温都尔庙北面的苏尼特右旗供销合作社，从1954年1月到1955年10月，收购了大宗的各种农、畜产品，并且收购了农、牧民过去因无法运输而抛掉的牛羊骨头30万斤。由于火车把大量的建筑材料运到了草原上，许多农、牧民盖了新房屋，改善了居住的条件。在修建集二线过程中，一面建筑、一面使用，除供应铁路所需要的器材以外，从1953年12月到1955年11月，已运送了旅客425，000多人，运输各种货物188，000多吨。现在，列车正从草原上源源不断地运出农、畜产品，又把工业建设材料、农业机械、农药、生活用品运进草原。显然，这对于内蒙古自治区的建设有巨大利益。
    在拔海1，500公尺的草原和沙漠上，经过了两年多的坚苦卓绝的劳动，有现代化设备的集二铁路终于建筑成功了！现在，摆在铁道部门面前的任务，是要努力经营好这条铁路。特别是太原铁路管理局集宁运输分局的全体领导工作人员、工人、技术人员和职员，要百倍地努力，积极学习苏联铁路运输的经验，推广我国铁路已有的和行之有效的各种先进经验，使这条铁路变成通车能力大、拉得多、跑得快、运输成本低的铁路，保证完成和提前完成1956年度的运输计划，使这条友谊之路在加强国际合作和支援我国社会主义建设的光辉的事业中发挥重大的作用。
