    Found the Path to Brightness
    Yan Yaoqiu, Director of the Shanghai Machine Factory, a Joint State-Private Enterprise

    In 1930, I and several friends pooled our resources to establish the Shanghai Machine Factory. At that time, the 4-horsepower diesel engine I produced, coupled with a 6-inch centrifugal water pump, could irrigate 30-50 mu of land per day, which, in theory, should have met the needs of the countryside. However, due to the severe oppression of farmers by landlords, and because the second year after the factory was established coincided with a major drought in both Jiangnan and Jiangbei, the rural areas simply had no money to buy machines. In the third year, we encountered the "January 28th Incident," and the factory was forced to shut down. In the subsequent four years, we managed to scrape by, and our vitality was slightly restored, but then the Japanese invaders occupied Shanghai, and the factory was forced to move to Chongqing, where we borrowed money to build factory buildings. Shortly after completion, the best workshop was destroyed by enemy aircraft.

    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the reactionary government, feeling that the seaports were open and American imperialist goods could be shipped in continuously, ordered the cancellation of the orders it had placed with us. Factories rely on production to survive, and canceling the orders was tantamount to forcing us to close down. The heads of various factories gathered to demand that the then-reactionary government's Wartime Production Bureau fulfill the contracts, and also petitioned Song Ziwen, the bureaucratic capitalist head of the puppet Executive Yuan, but were insulted by him. The reactionary government treated national industries with such fraudulent and irresponsible attitudes. As a result, all the factories that had moved inland had no choice but to sell their machinery and raw materials cheaply to send their workers back to their hometowns, and the enterprise I was running almost collapsed.

    After I returned to Shanghai alone, I found that the machinery and raw materials left in Shanghai had long been looted by the Japanese invaders, and the factory buildings had been turned into warehouses and sealed off by the reactionary government. I racked my brains, using the name of our inland relocation to support the Anti-Japanese War, and united the heads of 22 inland factories to petition the reactionary government separately, requesting permission to preferentially purchase enemy and puppet factories, and even resorted to using so-called "influential figures" and "gangster bosses" to intercede. In the end, we managed to exploit the loophole of the puppet currency devaluation and bought the enemy and puppet factories in four installments. At this time, we were again subjected to the pressure of the large-scale dumping of bureaucratic capital and surplus American imperialist goods, coupled with inflation, which forced us to live on borrowing money every day, with no way out. I once thought of relying on several larger factories to keep the factory going. These larger capitalists took advantage of my difficult situation and my weakness for fame, appointing me as the general manager, specifically dealing with external affairs, and giving me a higher monthly salary; they were responsible for production within the factory. However, after they took over the factory, they reneged on their promises. When the new manager came to the factory, he brought six cronies, armed with pistols, sold 60 tons of pig iron from the factory, dismissed all the workers, and I also lost my job.

    After liberation, these big capitalists, seeing that the situation was not right, returned the factory to me. With the support of the comrades in the factory, the factory officially resumed work on September 16, 1949, and was given a large number of orders and various support from the People's Government, and the enterprise gradually recovered its vitality. However, I still used the old capitalist management methods, so that although business was busy, the enterprise still lost money every year, and the turnover of funds was still difficult. When the enterprise encountered difficulties, I wanted to achieve joint state-private ownership as soon as possible, relying on the government to help me overcome the difficulties. In fact, I still had many concerns about joint state-private ownership. Later, after listening to the reports of the Party leaders and government heads, and reading the relevant documents, I gradually realized that enterprises must have socialist components in order to improve the production enthusiasm of the workers, and realized that only by further accepting transformation was there a way out. With the impetus and supervision of the worker comrades, and with the consent of the shareholders, I formally applied for joint state-private ownership of the enterprise in November 1953. Joint state-private ownership was officially implemented on New Year's Day 1954. After the joint venture, under the leadership of the state-owned representatives, various systems were reformed, the production enthusiasm of the workers continued to increase, and the number of workers also greatly increased. Looking back on the early days of my factory, under the banner of "saving the country through industry and improving rural production," the water pumps produced could only irrigate 30-50 mu of land per day, and the rural areas had no money to buy them. Today, the diesel engines produced by my factory have reached 150 horsepower, and the water pump diameter has reached more than 50 inches. For more than 20 years before the joint state-private ownership, no dividends were issued, and in the first year after the joint state-private ownership, the shareholders received interest. If it were not for the leadership of the Party and the government, there would be no such achievements today; without the support, supervision and efforts of the worker comrades, there would be no such results today!

    Now, all the industrial and commercial enterprises in the city have implemented joint state-private ownership. This is only the beginning of our mastering our own destiny. To completely master our own destiny, we must further transform ourselves and become self-reliant workers. We are determined and confident to strive to achieve this goal.

    找到了光明的道路
    公私合营上海机器厂厂长　颜耀秋
    1930年和几个朋友集资办了上海机器厂。我当时生产的4马力柴油机，配合6吋口径离心水泵，每天能灌溉30—50亩田地，照理能够适合农村的需要。但是由于农民受地主的严重压迫，由于开厂以后第二年又适逢江南、江北大旱，农村根本没钱买机器；开厂第三年又遭遇到“一·二八”事变，工厂便被迫停工。其后4年，惨澹经营，元气稍告恢复，但是日寇侵占了上海，工厂被迫迁到重庆，借钱造成了厂房。落成不久，最好的一个工场又被敌机炸毁。
    抗日战争胜利后，反动政府感到海口通了，美国帝国主义物资可以源源运来，就下令废止同我们订立的定货合同。工厂是靠生产来维持的，废止订货合同，就等于强逼关厂。各厂负责人集合向当时的反动政府战时生产局要求履行合约，又向伪行政院院长官僚资本头子宋子文请愿，结果反被他侮辱了一顿。反动政府就是以这样欺诈和不负责任的态度来对待民族工业者。结果弄得所有迁入内地的工厂只好廉售机器和原料来遣散职工回乡，我所经营的企业几乎崩溃。
    我只身回到上海以后，谁知留在上海的机器和原料早被日寇掠夺一空，厂房已经变为栈房，并且被反动政府接管查封。我费尽心机，利用我们内迁支持抗日战争的名义，联合了22个内迁工厂的负责人，分头向反动政府请求，允许优惠承购敌伪工厂，并且不惜利用当时所谓“有力人士”和“流氓头子”去说项。结果总算给我们钻到伪币贬值的空子，分四期付款，把敌伪工厂买下来。这时，又遭到官僚资本和美国帝国主义剩余物资大量倾销的压迫，加上通货膨胀，弄得天天靠借债度日，走投无路。我曾想仰仗几个较大的厂把工厂维持下来。这几个较大的资本家则利用我处境的困难和好名的弱点，确定我担任总经理，专门对外，并且给我较高的月薪；厂内生产由他们负责。但是，他们接收了工厂以后，就赖账了。新经理下厂时带了6个亲信，佩带手枪，售去厂内生铁60吨，遣散全部职工，我也失了业。
    解放以后，这些大资本家一看情况不对，才把工厂还给我。在职工同志们的支持下，1949年9月16日工厂正式复工，并且蒙人民政府给予大量定货和各种扶植，企业元气逐渐恢复。但是，我仍用老一套的资本主义经营方式，以致业务虽忙，企业仍是每年亏损，资金周转仍有困难。在企业遇到困难的时候，我就想早日得到公私合营，依赖政府来替我克服困难。其实，我对于公私合营仍有许多顾虑。后来，听了党的负责人和政府首长的报告，阅读了有关文件，才逐步认识企业中必须有社会主义成分在内，才能提高职工的生产积极性，认识到只有进一步接受改造，才是唯一的出路。加上职工同志们的推动和督促，并且征得股东的同意，我在1953年11月正式申请企业公私合营。1954年元旦正式实行公私合营。合营以后，在公股代表领导之下，改革了各项制度，职工生产热情不断提高，职工人数也大大增加。回想当年我厂初开办的时候，打着“实业救国、改进农村生产”的牌子，所生产的水泵，每部每天只能灌溉30—50亩田，而且农村无钱购买。今天我厂出产的柴油机已经做到150马力，水泵口径已经做到50多吋。公私合营前20多年没发过股息红利，公私合营后的第一年，股东就分到了利息。如果不是党和政府的领导，哪有今天的成果；不是职工同志们的支持、督促和努力，哪有今天的成绩！
    现在，全市工商业都已经实行了公私合营。这只是我们掌握自己命运的开端。要彻底掌握自己的命运，必须进一步自我改造，成为一个自食其力的劳动者。我们有决心和信心为达到这一点而奋斗。
