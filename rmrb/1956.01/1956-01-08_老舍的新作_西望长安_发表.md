    Lao She's New Work "Looking West to Chang'an" Published
    The play "Looking West to Chang'an," written by writer Lao She based on the political swindler Li Wanming incident, has been published in the January 1956 issue of "People's Literature."
    The play "Looking West to Chang'an" is divided into five acts and six scenes. It exposes the criminal activities and ugly soul of a political swindler who infiltrated state organs, satirizes and criticizes the imperfect personnel system and the political apathy and bureaucracy of some cadres in certain organs; it also creates the image of a positive character who resolutely fights against political swindlers.
    The China Youth Art Theater is already rehearsing this script. (Xinhua News Agency)

    老舍的新作“西望长安”发表
    作家老舍根据政治骗子李万铭事件写成的话剧“西望长安”，已经在1956年1月号的“人民文学”上发表。
    话剧“西望长安”共分五幕六场。它揭露了一个混入国家机关的政治骗子的罪恶活动和丑恶灵魂，讽刺和批判了某些机关中人事制度不健全以及某些干部政治上的麻痹和官僚主义；同时也创造出了坚决同政治骗子进行斗争的正面人物的形象。
    中国青年艺术剧院已经在排演这个剧本。　（新华社）
