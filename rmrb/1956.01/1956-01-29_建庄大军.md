The 17 agricultural cooperatives in Wulou Township, Chenliu County, Henan Province, have merged into one collective farm. These cooperatives have a total of over a thousand households; however, at the beginning of the establishment, only 27 people formed the preparatory committee. As a result, the work progressed relatively slowly.

After discovering this problem, they immediately expanded the preparatory committee, absorbing many activists to participate, forming an "army to build collective farms" of over a hundred people. The original property statistics team had only 3 people; after being reorganized into a 42-person statistics team, they completed the property registration work in two and a half days. The original propaganda team had only 7 people; after being reorganized into an 89-person propaganda team, they vividly publicized specific policies and production plans after the establishment of the collective farm to various types of people. In this way, a high tide of registration to join the farm and a high tide of production were quickly formed, and various economic problems were quickly resolved.

Running a collective farm is a matter for the masses, and it cannot be done well by relying only on a few staff members. It must be handed over to many activists and the broad masses to do.

Running a collective farm is a large-scale socialist undertaking, and small-scale efforts are not enough. It is necessary to adopt corresponding organizational forms.

    “建庄大军”
    河南省陈留县吴楼乡的17个农业合作社，已经合并成一个集体农庄。这些社共有一千几百户；可是，建庄之初，只有27个人组成了筹备委员会。因此，工作进展比较迟缓。
    他们发现了这个问题以后，就立即把筹备委员会扩大，吸收许多积极分子参加，成为一百多人的一支“建庄大军”。原财产统计股只有3人；改组为42人的统计队以后，两天半时间就完成了财产登记工作。原宣传股只有7人；改组为89人的宣传队以后，向各种类型的人生动地宣传了具体政策和建庄以后的生产规划。这样，很快就形成了报名入庄的高潮和生产高潮，各项经济问题也很快处理完了。
    办集体农庄是群众的事，只靠少数工作人员是办不好的，必须交给许多积极分子和广大群众来办。
    办集体农庄是大规模的社会主义事业，小手小脚是不行的，必须采取相适应的组织形式。
