A Township in Guizhou Province
Establishes 11 People-Run Schools on Barren Mountains

Xinhua News Agency

    This winter, Nanchao Township in Wangmo County, Guizhou Province, established 11 spare-time schools for farmers that moved up the mountains along with the land reclamation teams. More than 400 people are participating in the learning.
    Nanchao Township is a mountainous area inhabited by the Buyi ethnic group. Since December of last year, the farmers in this township have been collectively reclaiming land on the mountains to prepare for the establishment of cooperatives. Because they cannot return home for extended periods, the farmers moved their spare-time schools to the mountains. The Dahanzhai Huang Mingda and Huang Yong'an mutual aid teams, which are preparing to establish a cooperative before the spring plowing, were the first to build a thatched house on the reclaimed mountain and establish a farmers' spare-time school. Because this mutual aid team combined literacy with land reclamation effectively, all 60 members of the team participated in the learning, and no one has been absent without reason in the past month. Cen Buyi, a 50-year-old farmer, has also become an active learner. This team plans for each member to recognize at least 150 characters before the cooperative is established.

    贵州省的一个乡
    在荒山上建立了11所民校
    贵州省望谟县纳朝乡这个冬天建立了11所随着开荒队一起上山的农民业余学校。参加学习的共有四百多人。
    纳朝乡是布依族聚居的山区。这个乡的农民从去年12月以来就在山上集体开荒，迎接办社，长时间不能回家，因此农民们就把农民业余学校搬到了山上。准备在春耕前建社的打寒寨黄明达、黄永安互助联组，最先在开荒的山上盖了一间草房，成立了农民业余学校。这个互助联组由于学文化和开荒结合得好，全组60个组员都参加了学习，一个月来没有一个人无故缺课。50多岁的农民岑卜易也成了学习积极分子。这个组计划在建社以前每人至少认识150个字。
