    Emphasizing the Positivity of Capitalists in Socialist Transformation
    Zong Huai
    Recently, while vigorously reporting on the soaring socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff in private and joint state-private enterprises, the Tianjin Daily and the Beijing Daily have taken note of appropriately reflecting the positivity of bourgeois elements in accepting socialist transformation.
    The Tianjin Daily once published a news report titled "I Must Catch Up with the New Society," which was a reporter's interview with Liu Shuyong, the manager of the private Sino-British Trading Company. When the Tianjin Municipal Government approved the transformation of the import and export industry into a joint state-private enterprise for the entire industry, Liu Shuyong and the trading company's deputy manager Zhang Ruiting and assistant manager Yang Yinong decided to invest 100,000 yuan, which they had received as dividends from the enterprise over the years, into the joint venture. Why did they do this? The interview, through Liu Shuyong's recollection of the trading company's 20-plus-year history, explained how they were unable to control their own destiny before liberation and how, after liberation, they came to realize through factual education, learning, and the influence of their children that they could control their own destiny by taking the socialist road. Therefore, they decided to greet the joint state-private ownership with the practical action of investing capital. Not only that, this 61-year-old capitalist, who was born in the year of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 and had experienced "many heartbreaking things," expressed his intention to dedicate all his energy to doing a good job when others advised him to retire; because, as he said, "Now that our motherland has become strong, I really feel that I am getting younger and younger."
    In a news report titled "Changes in a Bourgeois Family," the Beijing Daily described the different paths taken by Zhang Huanyao, director (private representative) of the joint state-private Yihua Musical Instrument Factory, and his family before and after the "Five-Anti" campaign. Before the "Five-Anti" campaign, Zhang Huanyao engaged in speculative commercial activities, and his "Yihua Commercial Firm" was assessed as a seriously law-breaking household; his own life was also one of extravagance, and his wife spent money arbitrarily. This bourgeois family was shrouded in a miasma, and the couple even quarreled to the point of divorce. After the profound education of the "Five-Anti" movement, Zhang Huanyao made progress. He transferred the funds used for commercial speculation to industrial production, participated in the Democratic National Construction Association, and later applied to transform the enterprise into a joint state-private enterprise. After the enterprise was jointly operated, Zhang Huanyao actively participated in management and production research under the leadership of the state representative. His wife also became a teacher at the Xiangshan Orphanage and began a self-reliant working life.
    These two newspapers not only reflected the positivity of some capitalists in accepting socialist transformation through typical examples but also widely praised the progressive performance of capitalists in the high tide of socialist transformation in news and commentaries. In recent days, the Beijing Daily has reported how many capitalists, after the Beijing Municipal People's Committee decided to entrust the work of asset inventory and valuation to the capitalists themselves, worked earnestly and responsibly day and night with the assistance and supervision of the masses of workers, and completed this task quickly and well in just a few days.
    In addition to the two newspapers mentioned above, Shanghai's Liberation Daily, Tianjin's Ta Kung Pao, and others have also published reports reflecting the capitalists' active acceptance of socialist transformation. The fact that the Ji Muqing brothers, managers of the private Baida Cotton Weaving Factory, reported by the Liberation Daily and other Shanghai newspapers, invested their family's gold into the enterprise to welcome joint state-private ownership has caused a great reaction among the business community and among other classes of people. These newspapers' reports vividly illustrate that capitalists have made progress in recent years and are willing to accept socialist transformation; and that only by accepting socialist transformation can capitalists have a bright future and control their own destiny. Local newspapers should pay attention to using facts to publicize the positivity of capitalists in socialist transformation and the possibility of accepting transformation, in order to promote the further development of the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

    重视资本家在社会主义改造中的积极性
    宗淮
    最近，天津日报和北京日报在大力报道私营和公私合营企业中广大职工高涨的社会主义热情的同时，注意到适当地反映资产阶级分子接受社会主义改造的积极性。
    天津日报曾经发表过一篇“我一定要赶上新社会”的通讯，这是报纸的记者对私营中英贸易行经理刘树墉的访问记。在天津市进出口业被批准全行业公私合营的时候，刘树墉和这个贸易行的副理张瑞庭、襄理杨荫浓三个人决定把历年从企业中分得的红利10万元，拿出来投入合营企业。他们为什么要这样做呢？访问记通过刘树墉对这个贸易行的20多年历史的回顾，说明了解放以前他们怎样不能掌握自己的命运，也说明了解放以后他们怎样经过事实的教育，经过学习、经过子女的影响，认识到走社会主义道路就能掌握自己的命运。这样，他们就决定以投入资金的实际行动来迎接公私合营。不仅如此，这个在甲午中日战争那年出生、经历过“许多叫人痛心的事情”的61岁的资本家，当别人劝他退休的时候，他还表示要把自己所有的精力拿出来，好好地干一番；因为正如他所说的，“现在我们的祖国强大起来了，我真是觉得自己越来越年轻了”。
    北京日报在一篇题为“一个资产阶级家庭的变化”的通讯中，描写了公私合营艺华乐器厂厂长（私方代表）张焕尧及其家庭在“五反”前后所走的两条不同的道路。“五反”以前，张焕尧干的是投机的商业活动，他所经营的“艺华商行”被评为严重违法户；他自己的生活也是花天酒地，他的妻子则任意挥霍，这个资产阶级的家庭笼罩着一片乌烟瘴气，他们夫妇甚至闹得要离婚。经过“五反”运动的深刻教育，张焕尧有了进步。他把从事商业投机的资金转入工业生产，他本人参加了民主建国会，以后又申请将企业改为公私合营。企业合营后，张焕尧在公方代表的领导下，积极地参加经营管理和钻研生产。而他的妻子也成了香山慈幼院的教师，开始了自食其力的劳动生活。
    这两个报纸不只是通过典型的事例反映了某些资本家接受社会主义改造的积极性，而且在新闻和评论中广泛地表扬了资本家在社会主义改造高潮中的进步表现。连日来北京日报就报道了许多资本家在北京市人民委员会决定把清产估价工作交由资本家自己去做以后，他们在职工群众的协助和监督下，怎样认真负责、夜以继日地进行工作，在短短几天之内就把这项工作又快又好地全部完成。
    除上面说的两个报纸外，上海解放日报、天津大公报等也曾经发表过一些反映资本家积极接受社会主义改造的报道。解放日报和上海其他报纸所报道的私营百达棉织厂经理季慕卿兄弟把传家的黄金投入企业迎接公私合营的事实，就曾经在工商界中，也在其他阶层群众中引起过很大的反响。这些报纸的报道，生动地说明了几年来资本家是有进步的，是愿意接受社会主义改造的；也说明了资本家只有接受社会主义改造，才有光明的前途，才能掌握自己的命运。各地报纸都应当注意用事实来宣传资本家在社会主义改造中的积极性和接受改造的可能性，以推动资本主义工商业改造工作的进一步开展。
