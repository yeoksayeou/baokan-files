Visit to Japan
Guo Moruo, Head of the Chinese Scientific Delegation to Japan

The Scientific Delegation of the People's Republic of China to Japan, invited by the Science Council of Japan, visited Japan for more than 20 days, from December 1, 1955, when it arrived in Tokyo, to December 25, when it left from Shimonoseki.

The greatest achievement of this visit was to further promote contact and connection between the academic circles of China and Japan, and also to further strengthen mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and Japan.

This visit vividly demonstrated the fact that the friendship between the people of China and Japan has a deep tradition, and that restoring and developing the traditional friendship between the people of our two countries is the common desire of our two peoples.

We spent more than three weeks in Japan on a busy, pleasant, and unforgettable visit. From the first day we set foot on Japanese soil, we were warmly welcomed by Japanese academic circles and other sectors. We found that we were surrounded by the heartfelt friendship of Japanese friends. Wherever we went, we received a grand welcome and warm reception. Everywhere we heard the song "Tokyo-Beijing Song" and the cheers of "Long Live Japan-China Friendship". At train stations, residences, and welcome venues, the flag of the People's Republic of China was hung in most places. On the roads we passed, even late at night, when the train only stopped for two or three minutes, crowds of people would rush to the station to express their greetings. Japanese friends came to visit our residence in an endless stream from morning till night. All of this, without a doubt, was an expression of the Japanese people's friendly feelings towards the Chinese people.

During the visit, we spent half of our time in Tokyo. It is not only the political and economic center of Japan, but also the academic and cultural center of Japan. Here, we had many sincere conversations with many people from Japanese academic circles and other sectors. We visited the Japanese Diet and were welcomed by members of the Japanese Diet who had visited China. We visited many academic and cultural institutions concentrated here and received a large number of gifts of academic and cultural materials. We also joined peace-loving people from all walks of life in Japan to attend the peaceful funeral of Mr. Oyama Ikuo, an outstanding Japanese peace fighter, chairman of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, and winner of the Stalin International Prize for "Strengthening International Peace", expressing the Chinese people's deep condolences for the death of this peace fighter.

The other half of the time, we visited Chiba, Ichikawa, Sendai, Nagoya, Toyohashi, Kyoto, Osaka, Okayama, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Shimonoseki, Yahata, Beppu and other cities. In all these places, we received a warm welcome. We not only had extensive contact with academic figures in these places, but also became honored guests of the Japanese local authorities in these places. In these places, people said that the welcome we received was unprecedented. We will not forget that in Ichikawa, when visiting my former residence during my time in Japan, Japanese residents from the left and right neighborhoods, regardless of men, women, old and young, came to welcome us, and many people shed tears because of excitement. We will not forget that in Kyoto, Okayama, Toyohashi, and Fukuoka, when we visited many universities, including Kyushu University and Okayama University (one of its predecessors being the Sixth Higher School of Japan), where I had studied, all the faculty and students of these schools came to welcome us and listen to our speeches. We will also not forget that in Ichikawa, Kyoto, Okayama, and Fukuoka, we spent several very pleasant evenings, with Japanese friends joining us to enjoy ourselves, talk freely, or sing freely.

The conversations we had with Japanese academic circles and other sectors during our visit to Japan were particularly memorable. These conversations were sincere and cordial, expressing the common feelings and wishes of our two countries' academic circles and the people of our two countries.

The Japanese academic friends who talked with us all emphasized the cultural relationship between the people of China and Japan for more than 2,000 years. Japanese friends told us that Chinese Han Dynasty coins and pottery were found in Hakata Bay, and that the Beppu Museum also has earthenware coffins from the Jomon period unearthed in Japan. During the Taika and Nara periods of Japan, there was a craze for learning from China. Even today, the influence of Tang Dynasty Chinese culture on Japan can still be seen from the ancient buildings in Kyoto and Nara. In the Kyoto Museum, Japanese friends also showed us various cultural relics of Japanese people traveling in China during the Tang, Song, and Ming Dynasties. To this day, Japanese writing still uses Chinese characters as a foundation, and the Japanese people have never regarded Chinese characters as foreign characters. All this, as Mr. Yamada Saburo, President of the Japan Academy, said, the cultures of China and Japan are closely and inseparable. The vast majority of Japanese friends hope that the academic and cultural exchanges between the two countries can be fully developed under today's new conditions.

Many Japanese friends, including many local government officials, also mentioned the economic relationship between China and Japan. The mayors of Fukuoka, Shimonoseki, and Moji all said that their cities developed because of trade with China. They look forward to the early realization of the normalization of relations between China and Japan, and their cities are making all preparations for the new development of trade relations between China and Japan.

Many Japanese friends also mentioned that Japan's aggression against China in the past sixty years was the greatest misfortune in the history of relations between China and Japan. Mr. Yanaihara Tadao, President of the University of Tokyo, said, let the past be the past. Mr. Matsumura Kenzo, former Minister of Education of Japan, also said that not only Japanese scholars, but also Japanese politicians, have a responsibility to prevent this past history from repeating itself. Mr. Kaya Seiji, President of the Science Council of Japan, also said that Japanese scientists now encourage each other not to serve the war, but to serve the peace.

Many Japanese friends have expressed their hope that the people of China and Japan can interact in a friendly manner and live together in peace, and on this basis, fully develop cultural and economic exchanges between the two countries. They all said that the normalization of relations between China and Japan will be realized sooner or later, and they are willing to work to eliminate the obstacles that currently exist.

Many Japanese friends also praised the great achievements of the Chinese people in building their own country. From the conversations with Japanese friends, we feel that the Chinese people's construction cause is understandable to the Japanese people, and they have sincere respect for the Chinese people. Many Japanese friends hope to have the opportunity to visit China, and many Japanese friends have expressed their willingness to return the cultural relics and scientific and technological materials related to China that they have preserved to the Chinese people.

These conversations and expressions of Japanese friends prove that the Japanese people have deep friendly feelings and wishes towards the Chinese people. This feeling and wish is so universal and strong that even Japanese government officials such as Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru cannot but admit that there is a special cultural and economic relationship between China and Japan. That is to say, it is impossible for anyone to ignore and obliterate this special relationship.

Needless to say, the Japanese people's friendly feelings and wishes towards the Chinese people have resonated and been supported among the Chinese people. During our visit to Japan, whether in conversations with Japanese friends or in our public speeches – of which there were more than ten before and after – we expressed the Chinese people's friendly feelings and wishes towards the Japanese people.

We told Japanese friends that indeed, the history of friendly relations between the people of China and Japan for more than 2,000 years is worthy of our mutual respect. Although the dark age of the past 60 years has passed, its lessons are painful. On our side, this is the result of China's political lack of progress and national independence, while on the Japanese side, it is the result of Japan learning one more thing from the West after the Meiji Restoration, namely colonialism. The future is long, and the people of our two countries should live in peace forever from now on. Only in this way can we bring happiness and prosperity to the people of our two countries.

We introduced the Chinese people's various construction undertakings to Japanese friends. We told Japanese friends that our people's current wish is to build socialism in China and transform China from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. In order to build our own country, our people need a long-term international peaceful environment. Maintaining and consolidating world peace is the basic principle of our country's foreign policy. Our people are willing to live in peace with the people of all countries in the world, and especially willing to live in peace with the people of our neighbor, Japan.

We emphasized that the Chinese people are willing to restore and develop the traditional friendship between the people of the two countries on a new basis. Unfortunately, China
 and Japan have not yet established normal diplomatic relations to this day, which hinders the restoration and development of the traditional friendship between the people of the two countries. However, we pointed out: although relations between China and Japan have not yet been normalized, the people of our two countries still have every possibility to restore and develop the traditional friendship between the people of the two countries through various channels; and as long as the people of our two countries continue to make unremitting efforts to restore and develop the traditional friendship between the people of the two countries through various channels, the normalization of relations between China and Japan is inevitable and must come, and no force can stop it. We told Japanese friends that China's door is open, and the Chinese people welcome people from all walks of life in Japan to visit China, and those who have already come are welcome to come again.

During our visit to Japan, we also learned about many aspects of the lives of the Japanese people. The Japanese people are a diligent, brave, and wise nation. They have developed their motherland, established modern industry, developed science and technology, and created a brilliant culture with national characteristics. However, the Japanese people's current situation is difficult and painful. The colonialist policies of the old Japanese rulers brought terrible war disasters to Asia and the Japanese people, and after the defeat, under the control of the bellicose forces in the United States, against the will of the Japanese people, they led Japan to the wrong path of reviving militarism, thereby making the Japanese people a victim of American colonialism again. The United States has more than 800 military bases in Japan, and the total area of land occupied is equal to one island of Shikoku in Japan. The United States has also imported atomic weapons "Honest John" into Japan, which has suffered from atomic weapons disasters. The United States has also turned Japan into a market for American capital and commodities. The false prosperity created by relying on US aid and military appropriations cannot cover up the growing economic crisis. All of this has left painful marks on the lives of the Japanese people.

However, we also learned about the Japanese people's struggle to defend national interests and democratic rights. To give an example. It was during our visit that Ms. Seki Akiko, a famous Japanese musician and leader of the Japanese democratic singing movement, won the Stalin International Prize for "Strengthening International Peace". The democratic singing movement she led has spread throughout the country, and more than three million working people have participated in this movement. It can be said that in the worldwide anti-colonialism wave, the Japanese people are at the forefront. The Japanese people are playing a leading role in the struggle against foreign military bases and against atomic weapons.

In our talks and speeches, we frankly condemned colonialism and atomic blackmail policies, supported the Japanese people's struggle against colonialism and against atomic weapons, and expressed the Chinese people's supreme respect for the Japanese people. We told Japanese friends that the Japanese people are not isolated, and the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the peace-loving people of Asia and the world all sympathize with and support their struggle. They will surely find the strength to overcome all the difficulties on their way forward.

Our visit to Japan, our contact with the vast number of Japanese intellectuals, and especially our frank and sincere speeches, were warmly welcomed by the Japanese people, but they aroused the open hostility of American colonialists and a very small number of Japanese who are willing to serve as American lackeys. During our visit to Japan, American news agencies constantly fabricated rumors and carried out discord. A Japanese-run newspaper using English, "The Japan Times" ("Nipon Times") also slandered and attacked us. That's not surprising at all. If there were no such dissenting voices, the lives of the Japanese people and even the human race in the world would be much happier.

But that dissenting voice is very isolated. Of the hundreds of newspapers, large and small, in Japan, with a daily circulation of 20 million copies, only "The Japan Times" slandered and attacked us. Other newspapers, large and small, reported on our visit activities every day, regardless of size or length, and many newspapers also published fair comments. The reports and comments of these newspapers, regardless of their different political positions, have one thing in common, that is, they fully support the mutual exchanges of non-governmental organizations between China and Japan, support cultural and economic exchanges between the two countries, and look forward to the realization of peaceful coexistence between the people of China and Japan and the normalization of relations between China and Japan.

Originally, the facts are very clear. Peaceful coexistence and friendly exchanges between the Chinese people and the Japanese people are not only in the interests of the Chinese people, but also in the interests of the Japanese people. This point, in our contact with Japanese friends, we feel that we fully understand each other. What we discussed the most with Japanese friends was the issue of strengthening the friendly relations between the people of our two countries. Further develop the cultural and economic ties between the people of our two countries. We both understand that China and Japan are after all close neighbors, and the two countries have had a friendly relationship of mutual learning and mutual assistance for more than 2,000 years. The large amount of needs and supplies in China in the past 60 years has helped Japan's modernization. The people of our two countries have suffered enough from the lessons of war. The confrontation and discord between the two countries can only bring disaster and pain to the people of the two countries, while the peaceful coexistence and friendly exchanges between the two countries can not only bring happiness and prosperity to the people of the two countries, but also make a significant contribution to Asian peace and world peace. This is the common feeling and common wish of the people of China and Japan, and we dare to say that no force can stop the growth of this common feeling and common wish. This is the conclusion we have drawn from this visit to Japan.

    访日之行
    中国访日科学代表团团长  郭沫若
    中华人民共和国访日科学代表团受日本学术会议的邀请，从1955年12月1日到达东京至25日离开下关为止，在日本进行了为时20余日的访问。
    这次访问的最大收获，是进一步促进了中国学术界和日本学术界之间的接触和联系，同时也进一步加强了中国人民和日本人民之间的互相了解和友谊。
    这次访问生动地证明了这样一个事实：中日两国人民之间的友谊是有深厚的传统的，而恢复和发展两国人民之间的传统友谊是我们两国人民的共同的愿望。
    我们在日本的三个多星期，是在紧张的、愉快的、令人难忘的访问旅行中度过的。从踏上日本国土的第一天起，我们就受到日本学术界和其他各界的热烈欢迎。我们发现，我们被日本朋友的来自心里的友情包围着，无论走到那里，我们都受到盛大的欢迎和殷勤的接待。到处都听到“东京—北京之歌”的歌声和“日中友好万岁”的欢呼声。车站上，住地里，欢迎会场上，大多数场合都悬挂有中华人民共和国的国旗。在我们经过的道路上，那怕是深夜，火车只停留两三分钟，也有人群涌上车站来致意。日本朋友到我们住地来拜访的，更是从早到晚络绎不绝。这一切，毫无疑问，都是日本人民对于中国人民的友好感情的表示。
    在访问期间，我们有一半时间是在东京度过的。这里不但是日本的政治和经济的中心，也是日本的学术和文化的中心。在这里，我们同日本学术界和其他各界的众多人士进行了多次恳切的交谈。我们访问了日本国会，受到日本国会访问过中国的议员们的欢迎。我们参观了集中在这里的许多学术和文化的机关，收受了大量关于学术文化资料方面的赠品。我们还同日本爱好和平的各界人士一起，参加了日本卓越的和平战士、日本拥护和平委员会主席、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金获得者大山郁夫先生的和平葬，表达了中国人民对于这位和平战士的逝世的深切哀悼。
    另一半时间，我们访问了千叶、市川、仙台、名古屋、丰桥、京都、大阪、冈山、广岛、福冈、下关、八幡、别府等城市。在所有这些地方，我们都受到热诚的欢迎。我们不但同这些地方的学术界人士进行了广泛的接触，并且成为这些地方的日本地方当局的上宾。在这些地方，人们都说，我们所受到的欢迎是这些地方从来没有过的。我们不会忘记，在市川，当访问我个人从前留居日本时期的故居的时候，左邻右舍的日本居民，不分男女老少，都来欢迎我们，许多人由于激动而流下了眼泪。我们不会忘记，在京都、冈山、丰桥和福冈，当我们访问许多大学的时候，包括我个人曾经留学过的九州大学和冈山大学（其前身之一为日本第六高等学校），这些学校的全体师生都来欢迎我们，倾听我们的讲话。我们也不会忘记，在市川、京都、冈山和福冈，我们度过了非常愉快的几个晚上，日本朋友同我们一起尽情地欢乐，或者畅快地交谈，或者自由地歌唱。
    我们在访问日本的期间，同日本学术界和其他各界人士进行的交谈是特别令人难忘的。这些交谈都是真挚而亲切的，表达了我们两国学术界和两国人民的共同的感情和愿望。
    同我们交谈的日本学术界朋友，无不强调中日两国人民长达两千年以上的文化关系。日本朋友告诉我们，在博多湾发现了中国汉代的货币和陶器，在别府博物馆里还有日本出土的绳纹时代的瓮棺。日本的大化时代和奈良时代，曾经发生过向中国学习的热潮，至今从京都和奈良的古代建筑物上还可以看到中国唐代文化对于日本的影响。在京都博物馆里，日本朋友还给我们看了唐代、宋代和明代日本人士游历中国的各种文物。直到今天，日本文字仍然用汉字作基础，而日本人民从来没有把汉字当做外来文字看待。这一切正如日本学士院院长山田三良先生所说，中日两国的文化是密切而不可分的。绝大多数的日本朋友都希望两国学术和文化的交流能够在今天新的条件下充分开展起来。
    许多日本朋友，包括许多地方政府人士，也提到中日两国的经济关系。福冈、下关、门司的市长都说，他们的城市是由于同中国通商而发展起来的。他们期待着早日实现中日两国关系的正常化，他们的城市也正在为中日两国贸易关系的新发展而进行着一切准备工作。
    许多日本朋友还提到最近六十年间日本对中国的侵略是中日两国关系的历史上的最大不幸。东京大学校长矢内原忠雄先生说，过去让它过去了。前日本文部大臣松村谦三先生也说，不仅日本的学者，还有日本的政治家，都有责任不让这个过去了的历史重演。日本学术会议会长茅诚司先生还说，日本科学家现在都互相勉励不要为战争服务，而要为和平服务。
    许多日本朋友都表示，希望中日两国人民能够友好往来，和平相处，在此基础上充分发展两国的文化交流和经济交流。他们都说，中日两国关系的正常化是迟早要实现的，他们愿意为消除目前存在的某种障碍而努力。
    许多日本朋友还赞扬了中国人民建设自己祖国的伟大成就。从日本朋友的谈话当中，我们感觉到中国人民的建设事业是日本人民所能够理解的，他们对于中国人民抱着真诚的敬意。许多日本朋友都希望有机会到中国来参观，还有许多日本朋友表示愿意把他们保存着的有关中国的文物和科学技术资料交还给中国人民。
    日本朋友的这些谈话和表示证明，日本人民对于中国人民抱有深厚的友好感情和愿望。这种感情和愿望是这样普遍而强烈，以致日本政府人士比如日本外务大臣重光葵先生也不能不承认中日两国之间存在着文化和经济的特殊关系。这就是说，任何人要想忽视和抹杀这种特殊关系是做不到的。
    不消说，日本人民对于中国人民的这种友好感情和愿望，在中国人民当中是引起了共鸣和支持的。我们在访问日本期间，无论在同日本朋友的交谈当中，或是在我们的公开讲演当中——这种公开讲演前后有十几次之多，我们都表达了中国人民对于日本人民的友好感情和愿望。
    我们告诉日本朋友说，的确，中日两国人民之间两千年以上的友好关系的历史是值得我们互相尊重的。最近60年间的黯淡时代虽然已经过去了，但是它的教训却是沉痛的。在我们方面，这是中国的政治不进步和民族不独立的结果，而在日本方面，则是日本在明治维新以后向西方多学了一样东西即殖民主义的结果。来日方长，我们两国人民从今以后应当永远和平相处，只有这样，才能够为我们两国人民带来幸福和繁荣。
    我们向日本朋友介绍了中国人民的各项建设事业。我们告诉日本朋友说，我国人民现在的愿望是要在中国建设社会主义，把中国从一个落后的农业国改变成为一个先进的工业国。为了建设自己的祖国，我国人民就需要一个长期的国际和平环境。维护和巩固世界和平，这是我们国家对外政策的基本原则。我国人民愿意同世界各国人民和平共处，特别愿意同自己的邻邦日本人民和平共处。
    我们强调说，中国人民愿意在新的基础之上同日本人民恢复和发展两国人民之间的传统友谊。遗憾的是中
  日两国直到今天还没有建立正常的外交关系，这种情况妨碍了两国人民的传统友谊的恢复和发展。但是，我们指出：尽管中日两国关系还没有正常化，我们两国人民仍有一切可能，通过各种途径来恢复和发展两国人民之间的传统友谊；而只要我们两国人民继续进行坚持不懈的努力，通过各种途径来恢复和发展两国人民之间的传统友谊，中日两国关系的正常化就是不可避免的，一定要到来的，没有任何力量能够阻止的。我们向日本朋友说，中国的大门是开着的，中国人民欢迎日本各界人士到中国来参观，已经来过的也欢迎再来。在访问日本期间，我们还了解了日本人民多方面的生活。日本人民是勤劳的、勇敢的、有智慧的民族。他们开发了自己的祖国，建立了现代工业，发展了科学和技术，创造了具有民族特点的灿烂的文化。但是，日本人民今天的处境却是艰难而痛苦的。旧日本统治者的殖民主义政策给亚洲和日本人民招来了惨痛的战祸，而在战败以后，在美国好战势力的控制之下，违背日本人民的意志，又把日本导向复活军国主义的迷途，从而使日本人民又成为美国的殖民主义的牺牲品。美国在日本拥有八百多个军事基地，所占土地的总面积等于日本四国一个岛。美国把原子武器“诚实的约翰”也输入了深受过原子武器灾害的日本。美国还把日本变成了美国资本和商品的市场。道德腐败的生活方式也输进了日本。依靠美援和军事拨款而造成的虚假的繁荣也不能掩盖日益增长的经济危机。这一切都在日本人民的生活当中留下了痛苦的烙印。
    但是，我们也了解到日本人民保卫民族利益和民主权利的斗争。举一个例子。正是在我们访问期间，日本著名的音乐家、日本民主歌唱运动的领导者关鉴子女士获得了“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金。她所领导的民主歌唱运动已经遍及全国，参加到这个运动里面来的劳动人民已达三百万人以上。可以说，在全世界反对殖民主义的浪潮中，日本人民是站在最前列的。日本人民在反对外国军事基地和反对原子武器的斗争中起着带头的作用。
    在我们的谈话和演讲中，我们坦率地谴责了殖民主义和原子讹诈政策，支持了日本人民反对殖民主义和反对原子武器的斗争，并且表达了中国人民对于日本人民的崇高的敬意。我们告诉日本朋友说，日本人民不是孤立的，中国人民、苏联人民、亚洲和全世界爱好和平的各国人民都同情和支持他们的斗争。他们一定能够找到力量克服自己前进道路上的一切困难。
    我们的访问日本，我们同日本广大知识分子的接触，特别是我们的坦率而真诚的讲话，在日本人民当中受到了热烈的欢迎，可是却引起了美国殖民主义者和日本极少数甘心充当美国奴仆者的公开敌视。在我们访问日本期间，美国的通讯社不断制造谣言，进行挑拨离间。日本人办的一种使用英文的报纸“日本时报”（“NiponTimes”）也曾对我们进行诬蔑和攻击。那是一点也不足怪的。假使没有那种不同调的声音，日本人民乃至世界人类的生活应该是更幸福得多了。
    但那种不同调的声音是十分孤立的。日本全国大小几百种报纸，每天发行两千万份，对我们进行诬蔑和攻击的不过“日本时报”一家而已。其它大大小小的报纸，不论大小长短，对我们的访问活动每天都有报道，许多报纸还发表了公正的评论。这些报纸的报道和评论，不论它们的政治立场如何不同，都有一个共同之处，就是充分支持中日两国民间团体的相互来往，支持两国文化交流和经济交流，期望实现中日两国人民的和平共处和中日两国关系的正常化。
    本来，事实摆得很明白，中国人民和日本人民和平共处，友好往来，这不只是中国人民的利益，也是日本人民的利益。这一点，在我们同日本朋友的接触当中，我们感觉到我们彼此都是充分理解的。我们同日本朋友讨论得最多的就是加强我们两国人民的友好关系问题。进一步发展我们两国人民的文化和经济的联系问题。我们彼此都了解到，中国和日本毕竟是近邻，两国有两千年以上的相互学习、互通有无的友好关系，最近60年间中国的大量的需要和供应更帮助了日本的近代化。我们两国人民已都受够了战争的教训，两国的对立和不和只能给两国人民带来灾难和痛苦，而两国的和平共处和友好往来不仅能够给两国人民带来幸福和繁荣，并对亚洲和平与世界和平也将有重大贡献。这是中日两国人民的共同感情和共同愿望，我们敢说，没有任何力量能够阻止这种共同感情和共同愿望的生长。这就是我们从这次访日之行得出来的结论。
