    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th: TASS Moscow, 6th: The Soviet Antarctic scientific expedition's diesel-electric vessel "Ob'" has arrived in the Antarctic continent.

    The flagship of the Soviet Antarctic scientific expedition, after successfully navigating the Davis Sea, slowly entered its destination, Depot Bay, reaching a location where the ice layer was thick enough to bear the unloading of aircraft, tractors, and other equipment. The aviation team, led by Soviet Hero Cherevichny, landed on the ice there on January 6th. Aircraft assembly work has already begun.

    The first group of Soviet scientists has already departed for the mainland. They discovered a narrow area suitable for building residences and observation stations not far from where the "Ob'" dropped anchor. After a detailed study of the coastline from the Shackleton Glacier to Gauss Mountain by Soviet scientists and pilots, the construction site for the scientific research station will soon be finalized.

    “鄂毕号”到达南极
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：苏联南极科学考察队的“鄂毕号”柴油电动轮船，已经到达南极大陆。
    苏联南极科学考察队的这艘旗舰，在顺利地驶过了达维斯海之后，慢慢地驶入了它的目的地德波特湾，到达了一个冰层厚度能够承受卸下的飞机、拖拉机和其他装备的地方。以苏联英雄契列维奇尼为首的航空队1月6日已经在那里登上了冰层。飞机的装配工作已经开始了。
    第一批苏联科学家已经出发前往大陆。他们在离“鄂毕号”抛锚处不远的地方，发现了一个适宜于建造住所和观测台的狭长地区。在苏联科学家和飞行员对从沙克尔敦冰河到高斯山的海岸线进行了详细的研究之后，科学研究站的建筑地点即将最后决定。
