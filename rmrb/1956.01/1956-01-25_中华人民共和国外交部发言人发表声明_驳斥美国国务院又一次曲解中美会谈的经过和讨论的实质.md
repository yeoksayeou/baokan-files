Xinhua News Agency, January 24th—A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on January 24th. The full text is as follows:

    The U.S. Department of State issued a statement on January 21, 1956, regarding the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks, once again distorting the course and substance of the talks. In response, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes it is necessary to refute this based on the facts.

    I. Regarding the first item on the agenda of the Sino-U.S. talks, "the repatriation of civilians by both sides," the Chinese side submitted to the U.S. side a complete list and information of Americans in China at the beginning of the talks, clearly distinguishing between general American residents and law-breaking Americans. Since the beginning of the talks, all 16 American residents who applied to leave have been allowed to do so. Even among the 40 law-breaking Americans, the Chinese government has taken appropriate measures of leniency after individual reviews, releasing 27 ahead of schedule. However, the U.S. side has so far refused to submit to China a complete list and information of Chinese in the United States, has never accounted to us for the Chinese imprisoned in the United States, and after an agreement was reached on the first item on the agenda, it further adopted threatening measures, stipulating that Chinese in the United States must obtain Taiwan entry permits. Therefore, the U.S. side not only violated the agreement, making it difficult for the Indian government to carry out the tasks of a third country as stipulated in the agreement, but also attempted to deprive Chinese residents and students in the United States of their right to return home.

    II. Regarding the second item on the agenda, "other practical issues on which both sides have disputes," for more than four months, due to the U.S. side's deliberate delays and obstructions, substantive discussions on the "embargo issue" and the "preparation for higher-level Sino-U.S. talks" proposed by the Chinese side have not been possible. Even on the issue of renouncing the use of force proposed by the U.S. side, after more than three months of discussion, no agreement has yet been reached.

    It is China's consistent position that China and the United States should not use force and should resolve disputes between the two countries through consultation, especially the tense situation in the Taiwan area. As early as the Asian-African Conference in 1955, China took the initiative to propose this at Bandung. However, since the United States has already used force against China's territory of Taiwan, the proposition that China and the United States should not use force against each other must not be used to induce China to recognize the U.S. armed occupation of Taiwan, thereby legitimizing U.S. aggression. To realize the principle that China and the United States should not use force against each other, it is necessary to hold a meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the United States to resolve, ease, and eliminate the tense situation in the Taiwan area. In order to enable the Sino-U.S. talks to make progress step by step, the Chinese side proposed a new draft statement on December 1, 1955, advocating that after the ambassadors of China and the United States state in the statement that China and the United States abandon the principle of using force against each other, they should continue talks to seek feasible ways to realize this principle. However, this does not mean that the Chinese side has abandoned the proposal to hold a meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the United States. On the contrary, when the Chinese side put forward this new draft statement, it clearly stated that it would raise and realize this proposal in the continued talks.

    Respecting the right of each country to individual or collective self-defense in accordance with the United Nations Charter is also China's consistent position. However, in China's territory of Taiwan, there is no question of any self-defense for the United States. The so-called U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is itself a violation of China's sovereignty and interference in China's internal affairs, and is therefore completely illegal. There is no provision in the United Nations Charter that can be interpreted as allowing an aggressor country to have the right to self-defense on the territory of the country it has invaded. On the contrary, only China can exercise the right of self-defense on its own territory of Taiwan.

    The international issue of negotiations between China and the United States to resolve the tense situation in the Taiwan area must not be confused with China's exercise of sovereignty in the Taiwan area to resolve its own internal affairs. Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory. No matter how one quibbles, one cannot say that Taiwan is a part of the United States rather than a part of China. New China has inherited all of China's territory and sovereignty, and no statement from the U.S. Department of State can shake this indisputable fact. The relationship between New China and the Chiang Kai-shek clique is a matter of China's internal affairs. As long as it is possible, China will strive to resolve this issue peacefully, but the United States has no right to interfere.

    III. The two items on the agenda of the Sino-U.S. talks are interrelated. The U.S. side's violation of the agreement on the first item on the agenda, its delaying of the progress on the second item, and its issuance of a statement once again distorting the course and substance of the talks can only be interpreted as the U.S. side's attempt to confuse the truth, deceive the people of the world, and continue to delay the Sino-U.S. talks. The U.S. side has expressed in the talks its unwillingness to specifically stipulate the holding of a meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the United States, but instead demands that China recognize the U.S. right of self-defense in the Taiwan area. In the statement of January 21, the U.S. Department of State insisted on this unreasonable demand, and after the statement was issued, U.S. Department of State officials openly stated that the U.S. position on the Taiwan issue had no room for maneuver and was "non-negotiable." This can only show that the U.S. side has no sincerity in resolving the main disputes between China and the United States through negotiations, that the U.S. claim that all parties are pursuing their goals and policies by peaceful means is just a trick, and that the U.S.'s real intention is still to maintain and aggravate the tense situation in the Taiwan area and pursue its so-called "brinkmanship" intimidation policy.

    IV. To sum up the above, the position and attitude of the Chinese side are:

    1. The Chinese side has consistently abided by the agreement reached by both sides in the talks regarding the first item on the agenda. The Chinese side firmly demands that the U.S. side submit a complete list and information of Chinese in the United States, cancel measures such as the "Taiwan entry permit" that threaten overseas Chinese and students in the United States, and guarantee that Chinese in the United States can freely exercise their right to return home. It cannot be allowed that a situation in which one party faithfully implements the agreement while the other party

### 中华人民共和国外交部发言人发表声明  驳斥美国国务院又一次曲解中美会谈的经过和讨论的实质

    中华人民共和国外交部发言人发表声明
    驳斥美国国务院又一次曲解中美会谈的经过和讨论的实质
    新华社24日讯　中华人民共和国外交部发言人在1月24日发表声明。全文如下：
    美国国务院在1956年1月21日发表关于中美两国大使级会谈的声明，又一次曲解了会谈的经过和讨论的实质。对此，中国外交部认为有必要根据事实予以驳斥。
    一、关于中美会谈的第一项议程“双方平民回国问题”，中国方面在会谈一开始的时候，就向美方提交了在中国的美国人的全部名单和情况，清楚地区分了一般美侨和犯法的美国人。从会谈开始到现在，所有申请离境的16名美侨都已经获准离境，即使在40名犯法的美国人中，经过逐个的审查，中国政府也已经采取了宽大处理的适当措施，提前释放了27名。但是，美国方面却至今拒绝向中国提交在美国的中国人的全部名单和情况，从来没有向我方交代在美国被监禁的中国人，并且在第一项议程达成协议后，还采取了进一步威胁的措施，规定在美国的中国人必须取得台湾入境证，因此，美方不仅违反了协议使印度政府难于执行协议所规定的第三国任务，而且还企图剥夺我国在美侨民和留学生回国的权利。
    二、关于第二项议程“双方有所争执的其他实际问题”，四个多月以来，由于美方的有意拖延和阻挠，对于中国方面所提出的“禁运问题”和“准备更高一级的中美谈判问题”，始终没有能够进入实质性的讨论；即使对于美方所提出的放弃使用武力的问题，在讨论了三个多月以后，至今也仍旧没有能够达成协议。
    中美两国不使用武力，而以协商方法解决两国之间的争端，特别是台湾地区紧张局势的问题，这是中国一贯的主张。早在1955年亚非会议期间，中国就在万隆主动地提出了这一主张。但是，由于美国已经对中国的领土台湾使用了武力，在中美两国之间不使用武力的主张绝不能被用来诱使中国承认美国武装侵占台湾，使美国的侵略行为合法化。要实现中美两国之间彼此不使用武力的原则，就必须举行中美外长会议，解决和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势的问题。中国方面为了使中美会谈能够有步骤地取得进展，在1955年12月1日提出新的声明草案，主张中美两国大使在声明中美两国之间彼此放弃使用武力的原则后，继续会谈以寻求实现这一原则的切实可行的途径。但是，这决不是说，中国方面放弃了举行中美外长会议的主张。相反地，中国方面在提出这一新的声明草案的时候，明确声明将在继续会谈中提出并实现这一主张。
    尊重每一国家按照联合国宪章单独地或集体地进行自卫的权利，这也是中国方面一贯的主张。但是，在中国的领土台湾，对于美国来说，根本谈不到任何自卫的问题。所谓美蒋共同防御条约，那本身就是对于中国主权的侵犯和对于中国内政的干涉，因而是完全非法的。联合国宪章中没有任何条款可以被解释为容许侵略国家在被侵略国家的领土上有着进行自卫的权利。相反地，只有中国才能在自己的领土台湾行使自卫的权利。
    中美两国谈判解决台湾地区紧张局势的国际问题，绝不能同中国在台湾地区行使主权解决自己的内政问题混为一谈。台湾是中国领土的一部分。不管怎样狡辩，都不能说台湾是美国的一部分，而不是中国的一部分。新中国继承了全部中国的领土和主权，美国国务院的任何声明也不能动摇这个不容争辩的事实。新中国同蒋介石集团的关系是中国的内政问题。只要有可能，中国就将争取用和平方法解决这一问题，但是，美国没有任何权利进行干涉。
    三、中美会谈的两项议程是互相关联的。美方违反第一项议程的协议，拖延第二项议程的进展，而且还发表声明再一次曲解会谈的经过和讨论的实质，这就只能被解释为美方企图混淆事实真相，蒙蔽世界人民，继续拖延中美会谈。美方在会谈中表示不愿具体规定举行中美外长会议，却反而要求中国承认美国在台湾地区的自卫权利。美国国务院在1月21日的声明中坚持这种无理的主张，而且在这一声明发表后，美国国务院官员还公开声称，美国对台湾问题的立场没有转圜余地，是“不能谈判的”。这就只能说明，美方并没有诚意通过谈判解决中美两国之间的主要争端，美方所谓各方以和平方法追求它的目标和政策的说法只是一个骗局，而美方的真正企图仍旧是保持和加剧台湾地区的紧张局势，奉行它所谓“战争边缘”的恐吓政策。
    四、总结上面所述，中国方面的立场和态度是：
    1、中国方面一贯遵守双方在会谈中关于第一项议程的协议。中国方面坚决要求，美方提交在美国的中国人的全部名单和情况，取消“台湾入境证”等威胁在美华侨和留学生的措施，并且保证在美国的中国人能够自由行使回国的权利。不能容许一方忠实实施协议而另一方却恣意违反协议的这种情况长期继续下去。
    2、台湾地区的紧张局势是美国武装侵占台湾和干涉中国内政所造成的，中美之间的这一国际问题决不容许同中国政府和蒋介石集团之间的中国国内问题混为一谈。
    3、中美大使级会谈已经证明不能解决像和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势这样重大的实质问题。中国方面认为，必须举行中美外长会议，才是解决这个问题的切实可行的途径。
    4、由于美国已经在台湾地区对中国使用了武力和威胁，中美双方关于放弃使用武力的声明，必须导致美国在台湾地区的武力和威胁的解除，绝不能被用来诱使中国承认美国侵占台湾的现状。
    5、中国一贯支持联合国宪章中规定的单独或集体的自卫的权利，但是，这决不能被荒谬地解释为美国在中国的领土台湾有这种自卫的权利，来侵犯中国主权和干涉中国内政。
    6、因此，美国在中美会谈中企图要求中国片面地执行关于平民回国问题的协议，承认美国霸占台湾和容许美国干涉中国内政，是绝对办不到的。如果美国坚持这种无理要求，使中美大使级会谈拖延不决，美国就必须承担由此而产生的一切后果的责任。
