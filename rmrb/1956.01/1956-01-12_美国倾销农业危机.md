Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Washington Dispatch: US President Dwight D. Eisenhower submitted a special agricultural message to Congress on January 9th. The message pointed out that the US agricultural economy has been declining for five years, and farmers' incomes are continuing to decrease. "This economic reversal, unless corrected, will directly threaten the happiness of our people." The message believes that "no problem is as urgent as the plight of American farmers requiring the attention of Congress."

The message put forward a nine-point plan to deal with the crisis of agricultural product surplus. One of them is to establish a "land bank." Due to the difficulty in selling agricultural products, the "land bank" should try to "voluntarily reduce" the cultivated land area by 20%, or 25 million acres, in order to reduce the production of major US agricultural products such as cotton, wheat, corn, rice, and peanuts.

Another point in the plan is to lower the prices of government-purchased agricultural products sold on the domestic market. The message acknowledges that the government's doing so will compete with the agricultural products sold by the farmers themselves. This will further lower the prices of agricultural products on the domestic market and reduce farmers' incomes.

The plan stipulates the continued dumping of surplus agricultural products on foreign markets. The message specifically mentioned the need to expand opportunities to exchange agricultural products for strategic materials from other countries. The message also requested the modification of laws restricting the export of agricultural products only to "friendly countries" in order to be able to sell agricultural products to countries currently prohibited from exporting.

US Dumps Agricultural Products Abroad
Agricultural Exporting Countries Suffer Endlessly

Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The US policy of dumping surplus agricultural products to other countries through "economic assistance," "military assistance," "exchange of strategic materials," and the conclusion of forced import agreements has aroused increasingly serious dissatisfaction among many agricultural product exporting countries.

In 1955, US agricultural product exports increased by one-third, worth more than one billion US dollars, seizing a large number of markets from other agricultural product exporting countries.

The US dumping of wheat overseas has seriously threatened wheat exporting countries Canada and Australia. The Canadian economy has already fallen into serious difficulties due to a sharp increase in wheat inventories. Canada has repeatedly lodged strong protests with the United States, but has not achieved results. Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce Howe recently said, "What the United States is doing is undermining some of Canada's overseas markets." The US sale of 500,000 tons of wheat to Brazil last year also caused unease among South American wheat exporting countries. Uruguayan President Berres, a major South American wheat exporter, accused the US dumping of being a policy that "creates hunger for (wheat) producing countries."

Last year, the US government announced that it would further reduce prices and increase sales of one million bales of cotton on the world market after January 1st of this year. This news also caused unease in various cotton-producing countries. The Egyptian Minister of Finance said in November last year: "The situation is very disturbing, and the cotton world is in a state of flux."

On December 28 last year, the US government announced a plan to dump ten million pounds of butter, which immediately aroused protests from representatives of butter exporting countries such as New Zealand, Denmark, and the Netherlands stationed in Washington.

The US dumping of surplus rice to Southeast Asian countries and Japan has seriously squeezed the traditional markets of Myanmar and Thailand. The unsold rice in these two countries is increasing substantially. This US policy is being condemned by broad sections of public opinion in Myanmar and Thailand.

US Dumps Surplus Agricultural Products to Japan
Japanese Agricultural Production is Adversely Affected

Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry released a report on the situation of Japanese agriculture on January 9th, saying that the world's agricultural overproduction phenomenon, centered on the United States, is affecting Japanese agriculture. Foreign grain, especially US wheat, is increasingly imported into Japan, which has affected Japan's agricultural policy of increasing production.

The first surplus agricultural product agreement signed between the United States and Japan in May 1955 stipulated that Japan would purchase US$85 million of US surplus agricultural products. The Japanese magazine "Zen'ei" pointed out that this was the largest amount of US surplus agricultural products dumped to 13 countries under the agreement. "Zen'ei" magazine said that in addition to the provisions of this agreement, Japan is also the first foreign market for US agricultural products. The United States dumped 25% of its exported cotton, 16% of its wheat, 24% of its soybeans, and 54% of its rice to Japan.

Following the first agreement, the United States forced Japan to sign a second agreement last October, stipulating that Japan would purchase US$65.8 million of US surplus agricultural products.

    美国倾销农业危机
    艾森豪威尔提出农业特别咨文
    新华社10日讯  华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔1月9日向国会提出一项农业特别咨文。咨文中指出，美国的农业经济已经下降了五年，农民收入在继续减少，“这种经济逆转除非加以纠正，不然就会直接威胁我国人民的幸福”。咨文认为，“没有一个问题有像美国的农民处境那样迫切需要国会注意的”。
    咨文里提出了应付农产品过剩危机的九点计划。其中一点是建立“土地银行”。由于农产品的销路困难，“土地银行”要来设法“自愿缩减”耕地面积20％，或者2，500万英亩，为的是减少美国主要的农产品棉花、小麦以及玉米、大米、花生的生产。
    计划中的另一点是要把政府在国内市场上出售囤购的农产品的价格予以降低。咨文承认政府这样做将和农民自己出售的农产品发生竞争。而这样也就会进一步降低国内市场上的农产品价格，减少农民的收入。
    计划中规定继续向国外市场倾销剩余农产品。咨文特别提到要扩大用农产品来交换其他国家的战略物资的机会。咨文还要求修改限制把农产品只能输往“友好国家”的法律，以便有可能把农产品卖给现行法律禁止输出的那些国家。
    美国向国外倾销农产品
    农产品出口国受害无穷
    据新华社10日讯  美国通过“经济援助”、“军事援助”、“交换战略物资”、缔结强迫输入协定等办法向其他国家倾销剩余农产品的政策，已经引起了许多农产品出口国越来越严重的不满。
    在1955年，美国的农产品出口增加了三分之一，价值十亿美元以上，大量夺取了其他农产品出口国的市场。
    美国向海外倾销小麦，使小麦出口国加拿大和澳大利亚受到严重的威胁。加拿大经济已经由于小麦存货大增而陷于严重困难的境地。加拿大一再向美国提出强烈抗议，但是并没有获得结果。加拿大贸易与商业部部长霍威最近说，“美国正在做的是在瓦解某些加拿大的海外市场”。美国去年出售给巴西50万吨小麦，同样引起南美小麦出口国的不安。南美主要小麦输出国乌拉圭的总统柏莱斯指责美国的倾销是给“生产（小麦）国家制造饥饿”的政策。
    美国政府在去年就已宣布在今年1月1日以后将再向世界市场上削价增销一百万包棉花。这一消息也在各产棉国造成了不安。埃及财政部长在去年11月说：“情况是非常令人不安的，棉花世界正处于一种动摇不定的状态”。
    去年12月28日，美国政府又宣布倾销为数一千万磅牛油的计划，这个计划马上引起了驻在华盛顿的输出牛油国家新西兰、丹麦、荷兰等国的代表的抗议。
    美国向东南亚国家和日本倾销剩余大米，使缅甸和泰国的传统市场遭到严重的排挤。这两国滞销的大米在大量增加。美国这种政策正遭到缅甸和泰国广泛阶层舆论的谴责。
    美国向日本倾销剩余农产品
    日本农业生产受到恶劣影响
    据新华社10日讯  东京消息：日本农林省在1月9日发表了一份关于日本农业情况的报告说，以美国为中心的世界性农业生产过剩现象正在影响着日本的农业。外国的粮食，特别是美国小麦日益增多地输入日本，这已经影响了日本的增加生产的农业政策。
    美国和日本在1955年5月签订的第一次剩余农产品协定规定日本要购买8，500万美元的美国剩余农产品。日本“前卫”杂志指出，这是美国根据协定向13个国家倾销剩余农产品的数量最大的一项。“前卫”杂志说，在这个协定的规定以外，日本也是美国农产品的第一个国外市场。美国向日本倾销了它出口的棉花的25％，小麦的16％，大豆的24％和大米的54％。
    继第一次协定之后，美国又在去年10月迫使日本同它签订了一个规定日本向美国购买6，580万美元剩余农产品的第二次协定。
