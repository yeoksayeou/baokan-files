    Conscientiously Implement Several New Instructions of the State Council on Ethnic Work
    Xie Hechou, Director of the Political and Legal Department of the Ethnic Affairs Commission
    On December 29, 1955, the State Council issued the "Instructions of the State Council on Changing Ethnic Autonomous Areas Equivalent to Districts," the "Instructions of the State Council on Several Issues Concerning the Establishment of Ethnic Townships," and the "Instructions of the State Council on Changing Local Ethnic Democratic United Governments." These three instructions specifically stipulated the methods for changing ethnic autonomous areas equivalent to districts and townships and local ethnic democratic united governments established before the promulgation of the Constitution, as well as how to establish ethnic townships. Conscientiously implementing these three instructions will further promote the development of political, economic, and cultural construction in these areas, strengthen ethnic unity, and facilitate the development of socialist construction in these areas.
    I
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, various localities actively promoted the policy of ethnic regional autonomy. While establishing ethnic autonomous areas equivalent to counties or higher, 106 ethnic autonomous areas equivalent to districts and many equivalent to townships were also established. In some places, ethnic democratic united governments were also established. All of this was necessary at the time. Through these efforts, ethnic unity was strengthened, a considerable number of ethnic minority cadres were cultivated, the political enthusiasm of minority peoples was brought into play, and a positive role was played in promoting production and construction in these areas.
    However, years of work have proven that in a minority area with only one equivalent to a district or township, it is virtually impossible to exercise the various autonomous powers stipulated in the Constitution, such as managing local finances, organizing local public security forces, and formulating autonomous regulations and specific regulations, due to the small area, small population, and many restrictions. Therefore, it is now completely necessary, according to the provisions of the Constitution, to merge and expand the ethnic autonomous areas equivalent to districts and townships established in the past into ethnic autonomous areas, or to change them into district public offices and ethnic townships, in accordance with the specific local conditions. This is conducive to ethnic unity and further development of economic and cultural construction in these areas.
    In recent years, thanks to the implementation of the policy of ethnic equality, people of all ethnic groups have had appropriate quotas of representatives and a considerable number of cadres participating in the work of people's governments at all levels in areas with ethnic minorities. At the same time, the Constitution clearly stipulates the protection of the equal rights of ethnic minorities. The right of ethnic minorities to participate in people's congresses and people's committees at all levels has been fully guaranteed. Therefore, the local ethnic democratic united governments established in the past are no longer necessary and should be changed.
    Ethnic autonomous areas established in cities in the past also cannot fully exercise the various autonomous powers stipulated in the Constitution. The economy of the city is concentrated, and the minority areas in the city cannot, in fact, form a separate economic region; at the same time, in accordance with the needs of national economic construction, municipal construction must be planned in a unified manner, and ethnic minorities in the city will also migrate and move with the development of national production and construction. Therefore, the instructions of the State Council stipulate that the autonomous organs of the ethnic autonomous areas established in cities in the past should be terminated in accordance with the Constitution, and district people's committees should be established or street offices should be set up.
    II
    In the instructions of the State Council on changing ethnic autonomous areas equivalent to districts, the handling of ethnic autonomous areas equivalent to districts is pointed out as follows: those that have the conditions to merge or expand to establish ethnic autonomous areas should be merged or expanded to establish ethnic autonomous areas; those that do not have these conditions should be changed to district public offices. Since the promulgation of the Constitution, several autonomous counties have been established based on the original ethnic autonomous areas equivalent to districts, and the effect and impact after the establishment of autonomous counties have been very good. However, this does not mean that areas that do not have these conditions should be forced to do so. Any practice that disregards the actual conditions and ignores the consequences will definitely make mistakes.
    Ethnic autonomous areas equivalent to districts established in pastoral areas are generally characterized by small populations, large areas, and economic conditions that differ from agricultural areas, and ethnic relations are significant. Therefore, these areas can also be considered for establishing autonomous counties when conditions permit.
    The work of establishing ethnic townships should first consider local ethnic relations and conditions conducive to production, and should not be considered solely from the proportion of the ethnic minority population in the local area. At present, special consideration should be given to the needs of the development of agricultural cooperation. However, on the other hand, the various ethnic minorities who live scattered in Han areas or other larger minority areas generally have small populations and small areas of residence. If only the needs of the development of agricultural cooperation are considered, and the ethnic issues in these areas are not considered, and ethnic townships are not established, it is also wrong.
    III
    In order to correctly implement these three instructions of the State Council, we should follow the principle of prudence and progress to ensure that this work can be carried out on the basis of the broad masses' conscious willingness, so that it is conducive to enhancing ethnic unity. Therefore, the leading personnel of the people's committees in the relevant areas must personally grasp this work. It is necessary to organize cadres to conscientiously study the instructions of the State Council, so that they fully understand its necessity and correctness, and prevent and timely correct the erroneous understanding of some cadres who may misunderstand these important measures as "no need for regional autonomy" or "ethnic minorities cannot be masters of their own affairs." At the same time, it is necessary to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and explanation work to the masses. Only when cadres and the masses have a correct understanding of these important measures of the state can its correct implementation be guaranteed.
    When implementing these three instructions of the State Council, it is necessary to do a good job of investigation and research in advance, understand all relevant situations, especially the situation of ethnic relations, formulate plans, and make personnel arrangements. Attention should also be paid to preventing certain erroneous practices that some cadres may take. For example, some cadres may think that the problem is "very simple," and that all that is needed is to "change the sign," "abolish the organization," and "transfer cadres." This kind of thinking and practice is obviously wrong. Doing so will definitely arouse the dissatisfaction of the ethnic minority people and affect ethnic unity and the development of various tasks in the area. In order to do this work well, necessary meetings should be held for specific communication and deployment; full consultation should be held with local ethnic representatives to obtain their consent before proceeding, otherwise it is better to postpone the handling.

    认真执行国务院关于民族工作的几项新的指示
    民族事务委员会政法司司长  谢鹤筹
    国务院于1955年12月29日发布了“国务院关于更改相当于区的民族自治区的指示”、“国务院关于建立民族乡若干问题的指示”和“国务院关于改变地方民族民主联合政府的指示”。这三个指示，明确地将宪法公布以前建立的相当于区、乡的民族自治区和地方民族民主联合政府的更改办法以及如何建立民族乡等问题，做了具体的规定。认真地贯彻执行这三个指示，将会进一步促进这些地区的政治、经济、文化建设事业的发展，增强民族团结，并且有利于这些地区的社会主义建设事业的发展。
    一
    中华人民共和国成立以后，各地积极地推行了民族区域自治政策。在建立相当于县或县以上的民族自治区的同时，也建立了106个相当于区的民族自治区和许多相当于乡的民族自治区。在一些地方还建立了民族民主联合政府。这在当时都是必要的。通过这些工作，加强了民族团结，培养了相当数量的民族干部，发挥了少数民族人民的政治积极性，在推动这些地区的生产建设等方面也起了良好的作用。
    但是，几年来的工作证明：在只有一个相当于区或乡的少数民族聚居区，由于地区很小、人口很少和受许多条件的限制，事实上不可能行使宪法中规定的管理本地方的财政、组织本地方的公安部队、制定自治条例和单行条例等各项自治权。因此，现在根据宪法的规定，将过去建立的相当于区和乡的民族自治区，依照当地的具体情况，合并、扩大建立为民族自治地方或者改设为区公所和改建为民族乡，是完全必要的。这有利于民族团结和进一步发展这些地区的经济和文化建设。
    几年来，由于民族平等政策的贯彻执行，在有少数民族的地方的各级人民政府中，各民族都有了适当名额的代表和相当数量的干部参加工作。同时，宪法中又明确规定了保障少数民族的平等权利。少数民族参加各级人民代表大会和各级人民委员会的权利，已经得到了充分保障。因之，过去建立的地方民族民主联合政府就不是必要的了，应予改变。
    过去在城市内建立的民族自治区，也不能完全行使宪法中规定的各种自治权。城市的经济集中，城市内的少数民族聚居的地区事实上也不可能形成一个单独的经济区域；同时，依据国家经济建设的需要，市政建设必须统筹安排，城市内的少数民族也将随着国家生产建设的发展而迁徙流动。因此，国务院的指示规定：过去在城市内建立的民族自治区的自治机关，应该根据宪法一律结束，成立区人民委员会或设立街道办事处。
    二
    国务院在更改相当于区的民族自治区的指示中，对于相当于区的民族自治区的处理这样指出：凡是有条件能够合并或扩大建立民族自治地方的，就合并或扩大建立民族自治地方；没有这种条件的就改设为区公所。宪法公布以后，以原来相当于区的民族自治区为基础已建立了几个自治县，建立自治县后的效果和影响都很好。但这并不是说没有这种条件的地区也要勉强地去作。任何不顾实际条件不计后果的作法，就一定会犯错误。
    在牧业区建立的相当于区的民族自治区，一般是：人口较少，面积很大，它的经济情况和农业地区不同，民族关系显著。因此，这类地区在有条件的时候也可以考虑建立自治县。
    建立民族乡的工作，首先应该考虑当地民族关系及便利生产等条件，不能单纯从少数民族人口在当地所占的比例来考虑。目前，尤其应该考虑到农业合作化发展的需要。但是另一方面，分散地聚居在汉族地区或其他较大的少数民族聚居区中的各少数民族，一般人口少，聚居的地域小，如果只考虑适应农业合作化发展的需要，不考虑这些地区的民族问题，不建立民族乡，也是不对的。
    三
    为了正确地执行国务院的这三个指示，我们应当按照慎重稳进的方针，保证这一工作能够在广大群众自觉自愿的基础上进行，使它有利于增进民族团结。因此，有关地区的人民委员会的领导人员，必须亲自掌握这一工作。要组织干部认真学习国务院的指示，使他们充分了解它的必要性和正确性，防止和及时纠正某些干部可能发生的把这些重要措施误解为“不要区域自治”了，或“少数民族不能当家作主”了等错误认识。同时要广泛深入地向群众进行宣传解释工作。只有从干部到群众对于国家的这些重要措施有了正确的了解，才能保证它的正确实施。
    在贯彻执行国务院的这三个指示的时候，必须事先作好调查研究工作，了解各种有关情况，特别是民族关系的情况，定出计划，并且做好人事安排。还要注意防止某些干部可能采取的错误作法。例如有些干部可能认为问题“很简单”，只要“换个牌子”“撤销机构”、“调离干部”就行了。这种想法和作法显然是错误的。这样做一定会引起少数民族人民群众的不满，影响民族团结和当地各项工作的开展。为了做好这一工作，应该召开必要的会议进行具体的传达和布置；应该同当地民族代表充分进行协商，取得他们的同意，然后着手去做，否则宁可暂缓处理。
