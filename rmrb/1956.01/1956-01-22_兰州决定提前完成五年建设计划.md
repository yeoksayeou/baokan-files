Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, January 20th. The Lanzhou Municipal Congress of the Communist Party of China was held from the 7th to the 17th. The meeting decided to strive to complete the first Five-Year Plan one year or one and a half years ahead of schedule, and to build Lanzhou into a socialist industrial city as soon as possible.

    Lanzhou's capital construction investment this year has increased fivefold compared to 1955, and the task is very arduous. In terms of the socialist transformation of agriculture, the suburbs of Lanzhou can basically achieve full socialist cooperation within January. Efforts should also be made to eliminate 16 kinds of plant diseases and insect pests within 4 years, to afforest the north and south mountains within 5 years, to eliminate sparrows within one year, and to eliminate rats, mosquitoes, flies, and wolves within two years.

    The 266 representatives attending the meeting exposed shortcomings in their work in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and put forward many suggestions for improvement. In order to overcome conservative thinking, the meeting required all departments in Lanzhou to clearly establish the idea of serving large-scale industry and urban construction. Leading cadres should closely connect with the masses and with reality; they should fully mobilize the masses to carry out production increase and economy campaigns and promote advanced experiences.

    The meeting pointed out that the key to doing a good job in the above tasks lies in the strong leadership of the Party. Therefore, it is necessary to firmly grasp the Party's organizational construction and ideological construction, and change the situation where the Party's work cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the situation.

    兰州决定提前完成五年建设计划
    新华社兰州20日电　中国共产党兰州市的代表会议在7日到17日举行。会议决定要争取提前一年或一年半完成第一个五年建设计划，把兰州市早日建设成为一个社会主义的工业城市。
    兰州市今年的基本建设投资比1955年增加了5倍，任务十分艰巨。在农业的社会主义改造方面，兰州市郊区在1月份内可以基本实现全社会主义的合作化。并且要争取在4年内消灭16种病虫害，5年内绿化南北两山，一年内消灭麻雀，两年内消灭老鼠、蚊、蝇和狼害。
    出席会议的266名代表以批评和自我批评的精神揭露了工作中的缺点，提出了许多改进的意见。为了克服保守思想，会议要求兰州市各部门必须明确树立为大工业和城市建设服务的思想。领导干部要密切联系群众，联系实际；要充分发动群众开展增产节约竞赛，推广先进经验。
    会议指出：做好上述各项工作的关键，在于党的坚强领导。因此，必须抓紧党的组织建设和思想建设，改变党的工作赶不上形势发展需要的状况。
