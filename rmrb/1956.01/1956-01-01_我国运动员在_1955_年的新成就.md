　　New Achievements of Chinese Athletes in 1955
    Chinese athletes achieved many new successes in 1955.
    According to incomplete statistics, male and female athletes in track and field, swimming, skating, cycling, and male weightlifting broke 384 national records in 1955. In track and field alone, the number of national records broken reached 76, exceeding the total number of track and field records changed during the 13 years from 1936 to 1948 before liberation by nearly ten times.
    The widespread development of mass sports has brought forth many talented athletes. Li Fengqin, a worker from the Dalian Shipyard, broke the national record for the women's 3,000-meter cycling race. Liu Yunfu, from a poor peasant background, won the national championship in light heavyweight weightlifting.
    Many athletes have improved their performance rapidly through diligent study and hard training. Female athlete Shi Baozhu's discus throw was 37 meters 87 centimeters in April, and by December, it had improved to 45 meters 92 centimeters. Light weightlifting athlete Huang Qianghui's total lifting score was only 285 kilograms in March, but by December, it had improved to 342.5 kilograms. Swimmer Lin Jinzhu also broke the national record for the men's 100-meter freestyle, which had remained above one minute for a long time, twice.
    Ball game athletes also achieved good results in 1955. At the 5th World Youth Festival and the 2nd International Youth Games, half of the top 4 athletes in the men's and women's singles table tennis were Chinese table tennis players. The Chinese men's and women's basketball teams and the men's volleyball team achieved fifth place at this games, and the women's volleyball team achieved sixth place.
    Shooting, motorcycle, and parachuting athletes all participated in international competitions for the first time in 1955. Shooting athletes participated in the 1955 International Friendship Shooting Competition held in Beijing in November and achieved fourth place overall. Female shooter Li Suping also won first place in the women's 50-meter prone small-bore rifle event. Motorcycle athletes participated in the 1955 International Friendship Motorcycle Cross-Country Competition held in Stalin City, Romania, in October, and both the men's and women's teams achieved fourth place.

　　我国运动员在1955年的新成就
    中国运动员在1955年又取得了许多新的成就。
    据不完全统计，男、女田径、游泳、滑冰、自行车和男子举重运动员，在1955年共打破了384次全国最高纪录，其中仅在田径运动方面，打破全国最高纪录的次数就达到了76次，超过了解放前1936年到1948年的13年中改变田径纪录的总次数——七次将近十倍。
    群众性体育运动的广泛开展，涌现出许多有才能的运动员。大连造船公司的工人李凤琴打破了女子三千公尺自行车比赛的全国最高纪录。贫农出身的刘云富取得了轻重量级举重的全国冠军。
    许多运动员由于认真学习，勤苦锻炼，运动成绩提高得很快。女运动员石宝珠4月间掷铁饼的成绩是37公尺87公分，12月就提高到45公尺92公分。轻量级举重运动员黄强辉3月间举重的总成绩只有285公斤，12月就提高到342.5公斤，游泳运动员林锦珠也两次打破我国成绩长久以来停留在一分钟以上的男子百公尺自由泳的全国最高纪录。
    球类运动员1955年也取得了良好的成绩。在第五届世界青年联欢节第二届国际青年运动会上，获得男、女乒乓球单打前4名的运动员中，有一半是中国乒乓球选手。中国男、女篮球队和男子排球队在这次运动会上得到第五名，女子排球队得到第六名。
    射击、摩托车和跳伞运动员1955年都是第一次参加国际比赛。射击运动员11月间参加在北京举行的1955年国际友谊射击竞赛的时候，得到总分第四名。女射手李素萍在自选小口径步枪50公尺立射中，还得了第一名。摩托车运动员10月间参加了在罗马尼亚斯大林城举行的1955年国际友谊摩托车越野竞赛，结果男、女两队都得了第四名。男、女跳伞运动员8月间参加在保加利亚索非亚附近举行的1955年国际友谊跳伞比赛的时候，得了总分第七名。　（新华社）
