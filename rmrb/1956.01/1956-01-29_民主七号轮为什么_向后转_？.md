Why Did the "Democracy No. 7" Turn Back?

To the Editor:

On November 1, 1955, I took the Shanghai Port Authority's Democracy No. 7 ship from Dalian to Tianjin. At 12:50 noon, the passenger ship weighed anchor and set sail on schedule.

However, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the ship suddenly and hurriedly turned back and sailed back to the vicinity of Dalian Port to pick up a person; then it turned around and headed for Tianjin again.

It turned out that after the Democracy No. 7 set sail, it had to send a telegram to Tianjin Port. At this time, it was discovered that the telegraph operator was still on shore. The telegraph operator is the ship's ears and eyes; without him, the passenger ship cannot sail, so it had to return to pick him up. Here I want to ask: Why was the telegraph operator so derelict in his duty and leaving the ship at will? Why didn't the captain check the crew's whereabouts on board before sailing, as required?

### 民主七号轮为什么“向后转”？

    民主七号轮为什么“向后转”？编辑同志：
    1955年11月1日，我乘上海港务局民主七号轮从大连驶往天津。中午12时50分，客轮就按规定的时间起锚开航了。
    但是，到下午3点多钟，忽然轮船匆匆忙忙地向后转，驶回大连港码头附近去接一个人；然后又扭过头来朝天津开。
    原来，民主七号轮开航以后，要发电报给天津港。这时候，竟发现电报员还留在岸上。电报员是轮船的耳目，没有他客船是不能开航的，所以只好返航来接他。这里我要问：电报员为什么这样玩忽职守，随便离船？船长为什么在开航前不按规定对船员在船情况进行检查呢？李长根
