    Anhui and Hubei Provinces
    Plan to Eliminate Schistosomiasis in Five Years
    Anhui Province has established a Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Committee, planning to eliminate schistosomiasis within five years, and has decided to launch a large-scale mass prevention and control movement in schistosomiasis-endemic areas. In winter, the focus is on combining winter water conservancy construction and farmland water conservancy projects to organize the masses to eliminate Oncomelania snails. In schistosomiasis-endemic areas without winter construction projects, methods such as ditch clearing, soil burial, and burning are also adopted to eradicate Oncomelania snails. In the two months before spring plowing, combined with treatment work, publicity and education will be carried out among the masses so that agricultural production cooperatives can serve as the center, leading the masses to effectively manage water sources, feces, and eliminate Oncomelania snails around villages and workplaces.

    Hubei Province has established a Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Committee headed by Vice Governor Zhang Tixue and decided to basically eliminate schistosomiasis in industrial areas such as Wuhan and lightly affected areas before 1957; schistosomiasis in heavily affected areas should also be basically eliminated from 1958 to 1959, and completely eliminated by 1960.
    According to the province's prevention and control plan, Hubei Province will build 23 new schistosomiasis prevention and control stations and 100 prevention and control teams in 1956; at the same time, it will fully mobilize all medical forces, including practicing Chinese and Western medicine doctors, to participate in the prevention and control work, so that the number of schistosomiasis medical units reaches 400, ensuring that more than 100,000 people can be treated. In the spring of 1956, the province will also train 50,000 health workers for agricultural cooperatives.

    安徽湖北两省
    计划五年消灭血吸虫病
    安徽省已经成立防治血吸虫病委员会，计划在五年内消灭血吸虫病，并决定在血吸虫病流行地区开展大规模的群众性防治运动。在冬天，主要是结合水利冬修和农田水利工程，组织群众消灭钉螺。在没有冬修工程的血吸虫病流行区，也采取清沟、土埋、火烧等办法，扑灭钉螺。在春耕以前的两个月，结合治疗工作，开展对群众的宣传教育，以便以农业生产合作社为中心，带动群众有效地管理水源、粪便，消灭村庄周围和劳动场所的钉螺。　（本报驻合肥记者）
    湖北省成立了以副省长张体学为首的血吸虫病防治委员会，并决定在1957年以前，要在武汉等工业地区和血吸虫病轻疫区基本上消灭血吸虫病；重疫区的血吸虫病也要在1958年到1959年作到基本消灭，到1960年全部消灭。
    根据全省的这一防治规划，1956年，湖北省将要新建23个血吸虫病防治站和一百个防治小组；同时充分发动包括开业中西医在内的一切医疗力量，参加防治工作，使血吸虫病的医疗单位达到四百个，保证能医疗十多万人。1956年春季，全省还将为农业合作社训练卫生员五万名。
