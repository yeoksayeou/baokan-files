    China Department Store Holds National Production and Sales Balance Meeting to Determine Business Policy Based on New Market Conditions
    Under the leadership of the Ministry of Commerce, the China Department Store recently convened a National Production and Sales Balance Meeting for major daily-use merchandise in 1956.

    The meeting, based on the new situation of the rapid development of the agricultural cooperative movement and the further advancement of the socialist transformation of private commerce, anticipated that commodity sales would greatly increase in the future, public-private joint ventures would increase day by day, and commercial networks would be adjusted accordingly to the needs of the new situation. State-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperative commercial retail networks would also increase accordingly, all of which provide favorable conditions for expanding social commodity circulation. Therefore, the meeting believes that the arrangement of the 1956 commodity circulation plan must overcome conservative thinking and must be considered in conjunction with market changes and the establishment and planning of commercial organizations. Based on this situation, the meeting determined the future business policy of department store commodities. This policy is: it is necessary to actively expand sales, promote production development, and meet the needs of the people, thereby continuously improving the people's lives.

    After exposing and analyzing the serious situation of many products being of poor quality and high price in many regions in the past, the meeting put forward improvement measures. The meeting determined that in the future, the principle of pricing according to quality must be adopted when purchasing industrial products, resolutely opposing the practice of purchasing inferior goods at high prices, and also opposing selling inferior goods at high prices, in order to safeguard the interests of consumers and expand commodity circulation.

    The meeting also determined to organize the trial production of new products that are inexpensive and of good quality, adapted to the current consumption level of the people, especially the consumption level of the broad masses of farmers, in order to supply the people's ever-increasing material and cultural needs with more and better daily-use industrial products; at the same time, it also studied and proposed measures to completely eliminate the current chaotic property management and other phenomena in the department store system.

    中国百货公司召开全国产销平衡会议
    根据市场新情况确定经营方针
    中国百货公司最近在商业部的领导下，召开了日用百货主要商品1956年全国产销平衡会议。
    会议根据农业合作化运动迅速发展，和私营商业的社会主义改造工作进一步开展的新情况，预计到今后商品销售量将大大增加，公私合营商店将日益增多，商业网也将根据新的形势需要作相应的调整，国营商业和供销合作社商业的零售网也将相应增加，这些都为扩大社会商品流转提供了有利条件。因此，会议认为，1956年商品流转计划的安排必须要克服保守思想，要同市场变化，同商业组织机构的设置规划结合起来考虑。根据这个情况，会议确定了百货商品今后的经营方针。这个方针是：必须积极扩大推销，促进生产发展，满足人民需要，从而不断地改善人民的生活。
    会议在揭露并且分析了过去许多地区不少产品质次价高的严重情况以后，提出了改进办法。会议确定今后收购工业产品必须采取按质论价原则，坚决反对以高价收购次货的做法，同时也反对以质次商品高价出售，以维护消费者的利益，扩大商品流转。
    会议还确定要组织试制价廉物美、适应当前人民消费水平、特别是广大农民消费水平的新产品，以更多更好的日用工业品供应人民日益增长的物质生活和文化生活的需要；同时还研究提出了彻底消除目前百货系统的财产管理混乱等现象的措施。
