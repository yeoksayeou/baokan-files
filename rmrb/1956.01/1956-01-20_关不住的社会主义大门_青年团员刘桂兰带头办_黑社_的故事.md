The Unclosable Door to Socialism
—The Story of Youth League Member Liu Guilan Leading the Establishment of a “Black Cooperative”—
By our Special Correspondent Hai Mo

    Shuangcheng County in Heilongjiang Province is a place with advanced work. But in such a place, I happened to hear a district Communist Youth League secretary tell a story about a "black cooperative." He said that not long before Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" was conveyed, it was discovered that Liu Guilan, a young woman in Liquan Village, Taiping District, was leading the establishment of a "black cooperative." This cooperative was not officially recognized until after Chairman Mao's report was conveyed.

    His words raised many questions for me. I cannot believe that this is entirely the responsibility of the county party committee; the experience of Xiqin Village in Shuangcheng County, mentioned in Chairman Mao's report, is the best assessment of the county party committee's work. What makes me even more curious is that the leader in establishing the "black cooperative" is an 18-year-old girl. What is she like? Maybe this rumor itself is a bit exaggerated? To answer these questions, I asked Comrade Qin De, the secretary of the county Communist Youth League committee, to visit the matter together.

    The transport truck we were riding in had no canopy, and we encountered a cold wave, so when we arrived at Liquan Village, we were almost frozen solid. Liu Guilan and the director of their cooperative, Liu Jingxiang, were invited by Wang Deqin, the village Communist Youth League branch secretary and women's director.

    Anyone who meets this girl for the first time would never believe that she is the one who led the establishment of the "black cooperative." She is very sturdy, with her cheeks often flushed, and in a crowd, you can hardly hear her speak. She always hangs her head and looks at her own clothes buttons. Because of her personality, we had to decide to go to Linjia Wopu to learn about her leadership in establishing the cooperative through the masses. Unexpectedly, Liu Guilan ran over early the next morning, because the masses of their cooperative heard that we were coming and automatically harnessed a cart to pick us up. As soon as we arrived in Linjia Wopu, the masses surrounded us, men, women, old and young vying to pour out their repressed feelings of the past year. The masses adopted a thrilling name for Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "The socialist storm is coming, and this time we can truly turn ourselves over!"

    Linjia Wopu is a small village. This place could have greatly developed production, but because there were no Party or Communist Youth League organizations, and only the village head Zhang Zonglin was a Party member, it was long regarded as a backward village. In 1949, village committee member Liu Jingxiang led Liu Jingchun, Liu Jingzhi, and Hu Yegong to form a plow-sharing group, with a total of four horses. In this group, except for Hu Yegong, who was a farm laborer, the other three households were poor peasants. In 1950, it expanded to 16 households, but in the autumn, because the contradiction between plowing first and plowing later could not be resolved, they dispersed peacefully. In 1953, the district asked them to set up mutual aid teams again. This time it lasted for a year, and in the spring of 1954, it increased to 20 households with 17 horses. At the end of weeding this year, during the period of publicizing the general line, the higher authorities came to select targets for establishing cooperatives, and this team and the team of village head Zhang Zonglin became the targets. The district at that time called on them: "Work harder, and let's establish a cooperative together." This team had unity of purpose and worked hard, and their grain piles quickly surpassed those of Zhang Zonglin's team. The masses said: "If we have to choose one of the two teams to establish a cooperative, we will definitely choose Liu Jingxiang's team." However, the higher authorities had very tight control over the number of cooperatives to be established, and they did not come here to understand the situation in depth, so they decided that only one team could establish a cooperative. Village head Zhang Zonglin was a Party member, and the higher authorities believed that their team had leading backbone, so the establishment of the cooperative was approved. Liu Jingxiang's team was not approved.

    This sudden event was a great blow to the people of Liu Jingxiang's team. The masses were not convinced and insisted on establishing a cooperative. Liu Jingxiang asked the village head: "What is it that we are not as good as your team?" The village head said: "You don't have any hard bones!" Not having hard bones meant not having any Party members. When Liu Jingxiang came back and told the masses, they were all anxious: "If we don't have hard bones, can't we pile them up with meat?" Not being approved to establish a cooperative brought them great difficulties. Because their carts and horses had already been concentrated, and the farm tools had also been priced, if they were to be disbanded into teams, first of all, the manure would be impossible to divide. In addition, Zhang Zonglin's cooperative had already held an establishment ceremony, and the masses clamored: "If the higher authorities don't approve it, can't we establish a black cooperative?"

    Liu Guilan, Liu Jingchun's daughter, had just graduated from high primary school and was participating in agricultural production. She was very concerned about the establishment of the cooperative. Seeing the anxiety of the masses, she hurriedly went to find Wang Deqin. Wang Deqin couldn't think of a good solution either. They went together to find Jin Dexi, the Party branch secretary, who said: "Since the higher authorities have not approved it, it is best not to establish a cooperative." Liu Guilan said: "We must establish one. Everyone else is moving towards socialism, can we drag socialism by the tail? We are not afraid of anything else, we are worried about not knowing how to establish it." Jin Dexi thought: Since the masses have this demand, it is not good to suppress it hard. He prepared to ask the higher authorities for instructions on the one hand, and said to them on the other hand: "Didn't the cooperative of your village head already establish a cooperative? You can go and listen." Liu Guilan said: "They don't even invite us to their meetings!" What she was thinking at the time was that before the establishment of the cooperative, there had been a conflict between the two cooperatives because the people of Zhang Zonglin's cooperative had seized public land to pile up manure. Moreover, Zhang Zonglin's work style was not very good, so they knew that it was impossible to go and listen, so they decided to eavesdrop. She discussed it with the masses when she came back, and the masses also agreed very much, and everyone prepared: "Whatever their cooperative does, we will do the same."

    Liu Guilan and another high primary school graduate Liu Hongqing, demobilized soldier and Communist Youth League member Zhou Quan discussed and went to eavesdrop together.

    The first time they went, the people of village head Zhang Zonglin's cooperative were meeting in the house, and they were listening outside the house. They had just heard the village head say: "We must establish the banner of the cooperative, and use the cooperative to lead the teams..." Someone came out of the house, and they ran back. At this time, the masses of Liu Jingxiang's cooperative were all gathered in one place waiting for news, and Liu Guilan had to tell them the fragments she had heard. Liu Jingxiang panicked when he heard it: "Learning this thing can't be careless. What if we hear something wrong?" Liu Guilan said: "It doesn't matter, we will go every time they have a meeting in the future, and we will write it down in a notebook. Didn't they say to use the cooperative to lead the teams?"

    The second time they eavesdropped on the meeting, they ran into the district head coming to publicize the general line. Before they could finish listening, someone came out of the house again, and Liu Guilan ran away again. When she came back, she saw that the masses of her own cooperative had arrived even more completely than the people of Zhang Zonglin's cooperative, but she had not recorded everything. There was no way, thinking that it was the general line being discussed, which she had also learned in school, so she told everyone what was written in the political textbook.

    As soon as the general line was discussed, everyone's enthusiasm increased even more, and their determination to establish a cooperative became even stronger. They unanimously said: "If we are not approved to establish a cooperative, we will do it secretly." And they agreed: "No one is allowed to reveal it to the outside world. If someone asks, we will say that we are still running a team."

    The third meeting of Zhang Zonglin's cooperative was to discuss the issue of investment. When Liu Guilan and the others went to eavesdrop, they stood outside. Liu Guilan used a notebook to record, Liu Hongqing used a flashlight, and Zhou Quan listened under the window, telling Liu Guilan to record a little at a time. They also found the Young Pioneer Brigade leader Qian Fenglin to stand guard at the door. They agreed: if someone asked, the boys would say that they were digging out house sparrows, and the girls would say that they were visiting. It was already severe winter, and the fountain pen ink froze, so Liu Guilan had to keep breathing hot air on it to write. Later, her hands were also frozen numb. This time, she still didn't finish listening before someone came out of the house. The person who came out asked: "What are you doing?" The young people panicked in their hearts, and they didn't have time to answer the prepared words, so they ran away again. Liu Guilan also lost the fountain pen she had just saved 6 yuan to buy.

    Investment is a major event in establishing a cooperative. Liu Guilan didn't understand it clearly. When she came back, she only said: "We have to invest, one labor force invests 1 stone and 4 dou, invest more if you have more money, invest less if you have less money." As a result, the masses clamored, and some wealthy households were unwilling. Someone said: "Establishing a cooperative is too difficult. We don't understand it, and it won't be good!" Liu Guilan was very anxious and hurriedly said to everyone: "I heard that the village committee is going to study this matter tomorrow. My second uncle is a member of the committee, so you go and listen, and it's okay to come back and talk about it again?" The masses then calmed down.

    The next day, Liu Jingxiang went to the meeting and hid in a corner "sleeping." When others asked him, he said: "Anyway, we are not establishing a cooperative." Liu Jingxiang was honest and kind, and he didn't say a word back when others scolded him, but he knew what was going on in his heart. After the meeting, he ran back to tell everyone: "Okay, I understand everything this time!" It turned out that he was pretending to sleep. He conveyed everything he heard to the masses, and immediately opened up the masses' thinking.

    Because their cooperative was a "black cooperative," they didn't dare to hold meetings openly. Their meetings were mostly held in Liu Guilan's home in front of the barren Dianzi in the east of the village. Every night, people crowded the room. In order to avoid exposing the target, everyone blocked the windows to prevent light from leaking out, and a night watchman was placed outside. They always pretended to chat idly in the first half of the night, and then formally discussed the issue of establishing the cooperative in the second half of the night. People's enthusiasm became higher and higher. Whatever Zhang Zonglin's cooperative discussed, they implemented it accordingly. Those things that didn't work in Zhang Zonglin's cooperative, such as small contracting, could be implemented in this cooperative because everyone was holding their breath and wanted to run the cooperative well, so everyone gave in a little. They also elected the director and deputy director of the cooperative, and everything was done in accordance with the cooperative's regulations. The masses' reaction was: "Chairman Mao has opened the door to socialism for us. Even if we are not allowed to enter, we have to squeeze in."

    At this time, Sheng You Village nearby also established a "black cooperative," but unfortunately it was discovered by the district party committee. They asked the county for instructions, and the county instructed them to resolutely disband it. The district party committee sent people and spent a lot of effort to disband it. After Liu Jingxiang's cooperative heard this news, their actions became more secret, and everyone made a rule: whoever revealed the news to the outside world would be immediately expelled from the cooperative.

    No matter how strict their mouths were, people heard the news, and the village was already talking about it: Our village has a red cooperative and a black cooperative. The black cooperative is working even more happily than the red cooperative, and people's hearts are even more aligned. Liu Guilan went to report the situation to the village party branch secretary. The village party branch secretary went to discuss it with the district party committee secretary. The district party committee secretary already deeply understood that it was not right to forcibly disband the cooperative that the masses had established, but the decisions of the higher authorities could not be disobeyed, so he had to vaguely say: "It is best to run a team, and then establish a cooperative in the spring of next year." The village party branch secretary thought: "The direction of the Party is to engage in mutual aid and cooperation. Since the masses have already started it, it is best not to let it collapse." Seeing that the district party committee secretary's words were not so firm, he came back and enthusiastically supported Liu Guilan, often helping her solve some difficulties.

    Although the framework of the cooperative was set up, they heard that there had to be an accountant, but they were a "black cooperative" and there was no way to send someone for training. Liu Guilan thought about it and could not find a solution, so she went to Zhang Zonglin's cooperative's accountant to learn secretly. Zhang Zonglin's cooperative's accountant was Sun Yufang's father. Sun Yufang was Liu Guilan's primary school classmate and good friend. Liu Guilan borrowed the name of finding Sun Yufang every day to secretly watch how Sun Yufang's father kept accounts. She spent many days secretly memorizing the account book format, and carefully pondered what she didn't understand before she understood it. She learned the accounting method and taught it to the cooperative's accountant when she came back. At the same time, she sent people to buy some large notebooks, and one by one, they drew grids according to the ledger format, and made various account books. Later, they discovered that Zhang Zonglin's cooperative had a "labor manual" for each person, recording each person's labor points. This was uniformly issued by the county, and the "black cooperative" naturally could not receive it. They had to buy small notebooks and Liu Guilan led the young people to draw for five or six days according to the manual format before they finished.

    In this way, this cooperative was getting better and better day by day. But there were still many difficulties. Most of the people who joined the cooperative were poor households, and every household lacked food. When spring came and planting began, there were not enough laborers in the cooperative. Liu Guilan used all her thoughts to organize women to participate in production. From spring to autumn, the women hoed more than twenty *qiang* of hawthorns, stepped on more than twenty *qiang* of grids, weeded more than twenty *qiang*, and put out autumn ridges for more than ten *qiang*. They also fought aphids for 11 days, cut more than 6,000 catties of grass, and incidentally cut *wula* grass. When there was no material to feed the horses in the cooperative, she organized 10 women to gather more than 1 *shi* of grass seeds. In the autumn, she organized 9 women to cut 18 *qiang* of corn. After the autumn harvest, Liu Guilan responded to the government's call and organized 10 youth shock team members, each picking up more than three *dou* of grain.

    In the summer hoeing of 1955, this agricultural production cooperative was already very consolidated. They had no one to guide them, but they would follow the path pointed out by the Communist Party. Although they were exploring the establishment of the cooperative in secret, a check of all their practices was correct, without deviations, and it was even better than Zhang Zonglin's cooperative. The work was very standardized, the labor organization was reasonable, and the accounts were clear. They had a total of 74 *qiang* of land, of which 31 *qiang* of low-lying land were all hit by floods. The water was more than a foot deep. After the water receded, the seedlings were all red. In this way, each *qiang* of land still produced 3 *shi* and 5 *dou*, which was more than 1 *shi* more than the general mutual aid team. More than fifteen *qiang* of millet were also hit by drought, and each *qiang* of land produced 5 *shi* and 2 *dou*. In addition, two *qiang* of sorghum, which were hit by aphids, also produced more than 8 *shi* per *qiang*, exceeding the high-yield land of Zhang Zonglin's cooperative.

    It was not until Chairman Mao's report was conveyed that the "black cooperative" came out. On November 29, 1955, the higher authorities officially approved their cooperative. In the past, they had suffered from the repression of various conservative forces in order to take the socialist road. Even when the people from the county grain management office were doing "three fixings" work, because they were a "black cooperative," there was no way to decide whether to fix the purchase and sale figures according to ordinary households or cooperatives, and they also proposed: "We have to disband them before we can do it." Now they are like bent branches straightening their waists. In the past, they worried every day that they would be disbanded, especially in the spring of 1955, when rumors came that "there will be no cooperatives established for three years." The masses were always worried, fearing that this little socialist achievement would be taken away by those who criticized them for "rushing forward." Now, everyone's hearts are put down, and they feel that the door to socialism is open.

    Now, my doubts have been resolved. It is not surprising that such things happen even in advanced areas. This is not only the responsibility of the district party committee or the county party committee. First of all, the people squatting in the upper-level organs who issued the "resolutely shrink" order did not see the real demands of the masses, and did not see that the poor and lower-middle peasants had chosen from their own experiences to resolutely take the road pointed out by the Party Central Committee. This is also not because a young girl like Liu Guilan has special abilities. She only saw the demands of the masses and supported the masses because she grew up among the masses. Liu Guilan is only a member of the management committee of the cooperative, but the masses ranked her first in the list of cooperative members. The list reads "Communist Youth League member Liu Guilan," followed by the director and deputy director.... It is said that this is also a strange phenomenon. But thinking carefully, the thoughts of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are embodied in this Communist Youth League member, so it is not surprising that she is loved by the masses.

    关不住的社会主义大门
    ——青年团员刘桂兰带头办“黑社”的故事——
    本报特约记者　海默
    黑龙江省双城县是个工作先进的地方。可是就在这样的地方，我却偶然听到一位区团委书记讲了一个“黑社”的故事。他说：在毛主席的“关于农业合作化问题”报告传达以前不久，发现了太平区立权村有个女青年刘桂兰领头办了个“黑社”。这个社，直到毛主席的报告传达以后才被正式承认。
    他的话使我有不少疑问。我不能相信这完全是县委的责任，毛主席的报告中提到的双城县希勤村的经验就是县委的工作的最好鉴定。更使我奇怪的是：领导办“黑社”的是一个18岁的姑娘。她是什么样子呢？也许这个传闻本身就有些夸张吧？为了解答这些疑问，我约了青年团县委书记秦德同志一起去访问这件事。
    我们乘坐的运输汽车没有棚子，又遇上寒流，到达立权村的时候，我们几乎冻成了冰棍。刘桂兰和他们的合作社是在离此地二、三里路的小自然村林家窝铺屯内。村团支部书记兼妇女主任王德琴把刘桂兰和社主任刘景祥请来了。
    凡是第一次见到这位姑娘的人决不会相信她就是领头办“黑社”的。她人很结实，两腮经常泛着红润，在人群中，简直听不见她说话，她总低垂着头，两眼看着自己的衣扣。由于她这种性格，我们只好决定到林家窝铺去，以便通过群众了解她领头办社的经过。谁知，第二天一清早刘桂兰就跑来，原来他们社的群众听说我们来了，自动地套车来接我们。我们一到林家窝铺，群众就把我们团团围住，男女老少争抢着向我们倾吐这一年来的压抑心情。群众对毛主席的“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，采用了个惊心动魄的称呼：“社会主义大风暴来了，这下子我们可真正翻身了。”
    林家窝铺是个小屯。这儿本来是个可以大大发展生产的地方，可是由于没有党、团组织，只有村长张宗林一人是党员，所以这儿长期被看成是落后屯。在1949年，村委员刘景祥领头和刘景春、刘景志、胡业功三户，组成了个插犋组，共有四匹马。这个组里除胡业功是雇农外，其他三户都是贫农。1950年，发展到16户，到了秋后，因为先?后铲的矛盾解决不了，他们就和和气气地散了。到1953年区里又让搞互助组，这次坚持了一年，到1954年春，增加到20户，17匹马。这年铲地结束，宣传总路线时期，上级来挑选建社对象，这个组和村长张宗林的组就成了对象。区里那时号召：“加紧干哪，闹好了一块建社。”这个组人心齐，干得猛，粮堆很快就超过了张宗林组。群众都说：“若是两个组挑一个建社，准挑刘景祥组。”可是上级对建社的控制数字限制得很紧，又没来这里深入了解情况，就决定只能有一个组建社。村长张宗林是党员，上级认为他们组有领导骨干，建社就被批准了。刘景祥组没有被批准。
    这突然的事件对刘景祥组的人是个很大的打击。群众不服气，还是坚持要办社。刘景祥去问村长：“我们那点不如你们组呢？“村长说：“你们没有硬骨头啊！”没有硬骨头就是指的没有党员。刘景祥回来向群众一讲，群众都急了：“没有硬骨头，咱们用肉堆还不行吗？“建社没被批准，给他们带来了很大困难。因为他们车马早已集中，农具也作了价，要是拆散为组，首先粪就没法分。加上张宗林社里已举行了建社仪式，群众吵嚷起来：“上级不批准，咱们办黑社还不行吗？”
    刘景春的女儿刘桂兰，这时候正从高小毕业，参加了农业生产。对建社的事十分关心。她看到群众焦急，就忙去找王德琴。王德琴也想不出好办法。她们一齐去找党支部书记金德喜，金德喜说：“上级既没批准，你们最好不建社。”刘桂兰说：“我们一定要建，人家都走到社会主义了，我们能揪社会主义尾巴吗？我们别的不怕，愁的是不知道怎么建。”金德喜寻思：群众既有这种要求也不好硬压，他一面准备向上级请示，一面对她们说：“你们村长那个组不是成立社了吗？你们可以去听听。”刘桂兰说：“他们开会也不叫咱们去呀！”她当时想的是在建社前曾因为张宗林社里的人抢公有地堆粪，两个社有了矛盾。而且张宗林的作风很不好，所以她们知道去听是不行的，因此就决定去偷听。她回来和群众一商量，群众也很同意，大家都准备：“他们社怎么办，我们也照着怎样办。”
    刘桂兰和另一个高小毕业生刘洪卿、复员军人、青年团员周全等一商量就一起去偷听会了。
    第一次去的时候，村长张宗林社里的人在屋里开会，她们在屋外听，刚听到村长说：“要树立合作社的旗帜，以社带组，……”屋里出来一个人，她们就跑了回来。这时候，刘景祥社的群众都齐聚在一处等消息，刘桂兰只好把听到的片断讲了一遍。刘景祥一听发了慌：“学习这个玩艺，可马虎不得，要是再听出了偏差怎么办？”刘桂兰说：“不要紧，以后他们一开会咱们就去，咱们用本子记上，他们不是说以社带组吗？”
    第二次偷听会的时候，赶上区长来宣传总路线。没等听完，屋里又出来人了，刘桂兰又吓跑了。回来一看，自己社的群众比张宗林社里的人到得还齐，但是自己却没记全。没办法，一想是讲的总路线，这在学校里也学过，就照着政治课本上写的向大家讲了一遍。
    一讲总路线，大家的劲头更大了，办社的心更坚决了，他们一致表示：“不批准咱们办社，咱们就偷着办。”而且约好：“谁也不准向外暴露，有人问，就说还是办组。”
    张宗林社的第三次会是讨论投资问题。刘桂兰她们去偷听的时候，站在外面，刘桂兰用本子记，刘洪卿打手电，周全到窗下听，听一点告诉刘桂兰记一点。还找了少先队大队长钱凤林在门口放哨。他们约好：如果有人问，男孩子就说是掏家雀的，女孩子就说是来串门子的。这已经是严冬，钢笔水结了冰，刘桂兰只好不住地哈着热气写，写到后来，手也冻得麻木了。这次仍没听完屋里就出来人了。出来的人问：“你们干啥呢？”青年们心里一慌，准备好的话也来不及回答，又吓跑了。刘桂兰把刚攒下6元钱买的钢笔也丢了。
    投资是办社的一件大事，刘桂兰没听明白，回来后只说：“得投资，一个劳力投1石4斗，钱多多投，钱少少投。”这一来群众就乱嚷嚷了，有些富裕户就不干了。有人说：“办社这可太困难了，咱们又不明白，整不好啊！”刘桂兰十分着急，忙向大家说：“听说明天村委员会要研究这个事，二叔是委员，你去听听，回来再说还不行吗？”群众这才静了下来。
    第二天，刘景祥到了会场上就躲到一个墙角里“睡着”了。别人问他，他说：“反正我们也不办社。”刘景祥为人老实厚道，别人骂他，他也不回一句嘴，可是心里却有数，会议完了后，他就跑回来向大家讲：“行啦，这回都听明白啦！”原来他是装睡的。他把听到的一切全传达给群众，立刻打通了群众的思想。
    他们的社因为是“黑社”，不敢明着开会，他们的会大多是躲在村东头荒甸子前刘桂兰家里开的。每天晚上，人挤满了一屋子，为了怕暴露目标，大家把窗子也挡上了，免得透出亮来，外面还放了打更的，而且总是前半夜装着闲聊天，后半夜才正式讨论建社问题。人们热情越来越高，张宗林社讨论过一桩事，他们就照着实行一桩，张宗林社里行不通的，例如小包工，到了这个社，大家因为蹩着一口气，一心想把社办好都能让三分，就先实行了。他们又选出了社里的主任、副主任，一切都照着社的章程办。群众的反映是：“毛主席把社会主义大门给我们打开了，不让进我们也得挤进去。”
    这时候，附近的胜有村也成立了一个“黑社”，不幸被区委发现了，请示县，县里指示坚决要拆散。区委派了人，费了很大劲才拆散了。刘景祥社知道这个消息后，行动更加秘密，大家定下了纪律：谁要是向外透露了消息，立即开除出社。
    不管他们的嘴多严，人们也听到了风声，屯子里已经在纷纷议论：咱村一个红社，一个黑社，黑社比红社干得还欢，人心还齐呢。刘桂兰去找村党支部书记汇报了情况。村党支部书记去找区委书记商量，区委书记已经深深懂得了硬将群众建好的社拆散是不应该的，但是上级的决定又不能不执行，就只好含糊地说：“最好是搞组，明年春天再建社。”村党支部书记想：“党的方向就是搞互助合作，群众既然搞起来了，最好别垮了。”他见区委书记说话不是那样坚决，回来后就热情地支持刘桂兰，经常帮助她解决些困难。
    社的架子虽然搭好了，可是听说要有会计，他们是个“黑社”，没法派人去受训。刘桂兰想来想去没办法，就到张宗林社的会计那儿去偷着学习。张宗林社的会计是孙玉芳的父亲。孙玉芳是刘桂兰的小学同学、好朋友。刘桂兰每天就借着找孙玉芳为名，偷看孙玉芳父亲怎样记账。她费了很多天功夫，暗暗记下了账簿格式，有不懂的仔细琢磨才弄懂。她把记账方法学会了，回来又教给本社的会计，同时又派人买了一些大的笔记本，一个个照着簿记形式打上格子，做好了各种账簿。后来，他们又发现张宗林社每人都有一个“劳动手册”，记每人的劳动工分，这是由县里统一发给的，“黑社”自然领不到，他们只好买回小本，刘桂兰领着青年们照手册格式，画了五、六天才画完。
    就这样，这个社一天一天搞起来了。但是困难还很多，参加社的人多半是贫困户，家家都缺吃粮。春天到了，播种开始了，社中的劳力不够，刘桂兰用尽一切心思，组织妇女参加生产。从春到秋，妇女们打了二十多垧楂子，踩了二十多垧格子，薅地二十多垧，放秋垅十来垧，又打了11天腻虫，打草六千多斤，稍带还割了靰鞡草；社里没料喂马了，她又组织10个妇女撸草籽一石多。到秋天又组织9个妇女割了18垧玉米。秋收完，刘桂兰又响应政府号召，组织了10名青年突击队员，每人拣三斗多粮食。
    在1955年夏锄，这个农业生产合作社已经十分巩固了，他们没有人指导，但是他们会照着共产党指点的路走。他们虽然是在暗中摸索着办的社，但检查一下他们的一切作法都是正确的，没有偏差，比张宗林社办得还好。工作很正规，劳动组织合理，账目一清二白。他们总共有74垧地，其中31垧洼地全部遭了水灾，水有一尺多深，水退后，小苗都红了，这样每垧地还打了3石5斗，比一般互助组多打一石多。还有十五垧多谷子也遭了旱灾，每垧地打5石2斗，此外有两垧遭了腻虫的高粱每垧也打了八石多，超过了张宗林社的高产地。
    直等到毛主席的报告传达下来以后，“黑社”才出了头。在1955年11月29日上级正式批准了他们的社。过去，他们为了走社会主义道路受尽了各种保守力量的压制，连县里粮食管理所的人作“三定”工作的时候，因为他们是“黑社”，没法决定应按普通户还是按合作社定购、销数字，也提出：“非得把他们拆散了才行。”如今他们就像压弯了的树枝伸直了腰。过去，他们每天担心怕被拆散，尤其在1955年春天，传来谣言：“三年不建社了。”群众整天提心吊胆，生怕这点社会主义成绩被批评他们“冒进”的人夺了去。现在，大家的心放下了，他们感到社会主义的大门敞开着。
    现在，我的疑问解决了，即使在先进地区出现这样的事情也并不足为怪。这也不单是区委或县委的责任，首先蹲在上层机关发出“坚决收缩”命令的人就没看见群众的真正要求，没看见贫雇农是从自己的经历中选定了坚决要走党中央所指出的道路的；这也不是刘桂兰这样个年青姑娘有特殊本领，她只是因为生长在群众中，看见了群众的要求，并且支持了群众。刘桂兰只是社里的管理委员，可是群众把她排在社员名单中的第一名，名单上写着“团员刘桂兰”，下面才是社主任，副主任……。按说，这也是奇怪的现象。可是仔细想想，就在这个团员身上却体现了党中央和毛主席的思想，因此，她得到群众的爱戴，是一点也不奇怪的。
