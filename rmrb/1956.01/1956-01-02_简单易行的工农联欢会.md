　　Simple and Easy Worker-Peasant Get-Togethers
    The trade union of Mulan County, Heilongjiang Province, has recently held frequent worker-peasant get-togethers to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

    Originally, hundreds of carts entered the city every day in the winter to deliver grain, and farmers from far away had to stay overnight in the city. It got dark around 4:00 PM every day and didn't get light until 6:30 AM the next day, so they had to spend this long night in the cart inns. Seeing this situation, the Mulan County Federation of Trade Unions began to hold these worker-peasant get-togethers in mid-November to entertain the farmers who came to the city to deliver grain. Every night, they prepared some tea and held informal forums with the farmers, reporting on production and study, or the trade union sent people to give lectures and reports on current affairs and policies; after the talks, they put on some simple programs. For a month, about a hundred farmers participated every night, and the relationship was very harmonious.

    This simple and easy worker-peasant get-together is a good way to communicate the feelings of workers and peasants.

　　简单易行的工农联欢会
    黑龙江省木兰县工会为巩固工农联盟，最近以来经常举办工农联欢会。
    本来冬季每天都有数百辆大车进城送粮，路远的农民都要在城内留宿。每天下午四点钟左右天就黑了，到第二天六点半才天亮，他们只好把这漫长的黑夜消耗在大车店里。木兰县工会看到这一情况，就在11月中旬，开始举办这种工农联欢会，招待到城内送粮的农民。他们每晚准备一些茶水，同农民举行不拘形式的座谈会，互相报告一些生产和学习情况，或由工会派人作时事、政策的讲演报告；谈完以后，就演出一些简单节目。一个月以来，每晚都有约百名农民参加，关系非常融洽。
    这种简单易行的工农联欢会，是沟通工人农民情感的好办法。
