Xinhua News Agency, New York, 18th (TASS): Senator Nolan, in a speech at the New York Economic Club, advocated revising the U.S. aid program to neutral countries. He said that neutrals must be required to participate in "anti-communist collective security" agreements (i.e., various aggressive military blocs established by the United States) as a condition for aid.

Nolan attacked those countries that, on the one hand, accept U.S. aid while attempting to "lure other countries away from the collective security system and attract them with neutralism."

When Nolan was asked to name the countries he was criticizing, he said that these were primarily India and Yugoslavia, as well as some other countries.

    美参议员诺兰攻击中立国
    新华社19日讯　塔斯社纽约18日讯：参议员诺兰在纽约经济俱乐部发表演说，主张修改美国援助中立国家的计划。他说，必须要求中立者参加“反共产主义的集体安全”协定（即美国建立的各种侵略军事集团），以作为援助的代价。
    诺兰攻击了那些一方面接受美援，同时企图“引诱其他国家脱离集体安全体系、并且用中立主义来吸引它们”的国家。
    有人请诺兰指出他所抨击的国家的名字，他说，这首先是印度和南斯拉夫，还有其他一些国家。
