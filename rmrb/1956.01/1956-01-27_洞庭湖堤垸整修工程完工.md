    The Dongting Lake dike and embankment repair project, which began last winter and this spring, has been completed ahead of schedule. More than 200,000 civilian laborers participated, completing over 20 million cubic meters of earthwork, opening canals and dredging rivers for more than 230 kilometers, and constructing two modern sluice gates.
    After the completion of this project, over 1.1 million mu of fertile land will be basically free from the threat of waterlogging and drought, and nearly 140,000 mu of cultivated land will be expanded, with an annual increase in grain production of over 100 million jin.

    洞庭湖堤垸整修工程完工
    洞庭湖去冬今春的堤垸整修工程已经提前完工，上堤民工有20多万人，完成土方2，000多万公方，开渠和疏河230多公里，建成近代化水闸两处。
    这项工程完成以后，使110多万亩良田基本上免除了渍灾和旱灾的威胁，并且扩大耕地近14万亩，每年约可增产粮食1亿多斤。
