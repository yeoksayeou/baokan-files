　　Embarking on a Decisive Step
　　By our correspondents Ji Yin and Xi Ping

　　On January 20th, a historic conference was held in the brightly lit Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building: the Shanghai Municipal Public-Private Partnership Conference for Capitalist Industry and Commerce. The venue was decorated like a grand festive occasion, with large red "囍" (double happiness) characters made of neon lights hanging, surrounded by red curtains. The capitalist representatives and their families attending the conference were all dressed in splendid festive attire, wearing red flowers on their chests, their faces unable to conceal their inner excitement and joy.

　　Amidst thunderous applause, the representative of the Shanghai bourgeoisie – Sheng Pihua, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce – solemnly walked to the rostrum and presented the golden general application to Cao Diqiu, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai. Cao Diqiu, representing Shanghai Mayor Chen Yi, signed and stamped the application, formally announcing the approval for the complete implementation of public-private partnership in Shanghai's capitalist industry and commerce.

　　From the very beginning, the meeting was submerged in continuous applause and cheers. People stood up dozens of times, repeatedly shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the Communist Party!" hundreds of times. When it came to the free speech session, a long queue formed beside the microphone, with private factory directors, small shop owners, wives of capitalists, and workers from private factories. Some had heads full of white hair, while others were only in their twenties. They spoke one after another, only choosing the most important things to say due to the limited time. Many people went to the microphone and, filled with gratitude, simply shouted:

　　"Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party!"

　　These grateful voices resonated not only in the hall but also among the tens of thousands of industry and commerce workers waiting around the building, and in the thousands of private factories and shops, and the homes of industry and commerce workers throughout the city...

　　What a great event this is! Transforming all capitalist enterprises into semi-socialist enterprises – public-private partnerships – is essentially a revolution in changing production relations. However, in our country, this revolution is now being completed in such a peaceful and joyful manner.

　　This historic achievement of Shanghai's private industry and commerce fully implementing public-private partnership was attained after fierce struggle. However, this struggle did not take the form of bloodshed but rather the form of ideological education and criticism and self-criticism within the people. Over the past few years, Shanghai's private industrialists and businessmen have continuously received education from the Party and the government, raising their political awareness. Since the Second Session of the First Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce in November of last year, this ideological education and criticism and self-criticism has further expanded and become richer in content. More than 170,000 capitalists and their agents in Shanghai participated in this study. In gatherings and study groups, many capitalists used their own personal experiences to expose the various sinful facts of the capitalist exploitation system, where man eats man. Of course, acknowledging these facts was the result of intense ideological struggle, as well as criticism and self-criticism. They argued heatedly, their faces flushed, and many tossed and turned all night, unable to sleep. Qiang Xilin, a capitalist from Shanghai Huafeng Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory and Lisheng Machinery Factory, said: "In the early days of liberation, when I heard terms like workers supporting capitalists and capitalists being exploiters, I was really unconvinced and always wanted to plug my ears so I wouldn't have to listen." Recently, he calmly did the math: 28 years ago, he was a small clerk with a monthly salary of 20 yuan, and now he is a big capitalist with three factories. If he had remained at 20 yuan a month for 28 years, even if he didn't spend a penny and saved it all, it would still take 12,567 years of accumulation, meaning he would have to live over 12,567 years, to start these businesses. As a result, he came to the conclusion: "Facts prove that the businesses I run come from exploitation. The so-called hard work and diligence are just euphemisms for stealing surplus value."

　　Chairman Mao's teachings on how the bourgeoisie can master their own destiny have been the central focus of study and self-criticism for hundreds of thousands of industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai in recent months. They describe Chairman Mao's teachings as a bright light in the dark night, illuminating their path. Countless painful past events have shown that in the past, the Chinese bourgeoisie could not control their own destiny. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, many large industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai used huge sums of money, through bribery, to hang American and British flags, hoping to use the prestige of imperialism to protect themselves. But as a result, once the Pacific War broke out, these enterprises were still swallowed by another imperialism, and some capitalists were even arrested by the Japanese invaders. Hong Nianzu, a capitalist from Dachunghua Rubber Factory, said: "When I was being escorted across the Waibaidu Bridge, I was saddened that I had no country, no career, and couldn't even protect my own life and property."

　　Countless bloody facts were once again presented before the capitalists. In the past, many bourgeois families were ruined in cruel infighting and feuds. The famous capitalist, Fang Yexian, General Manager of China Chemical Industry Society, in order to protect his business and personal safety, once hung an American flag on the enterprise, renamed it American United Industries Company, became a Portuguese citizen, learned to shoot with both hands, and hired two bodyguards to follow him at all times. But in the end, he was still kidnapped and beaten to death, and even his body has never been found. People in Shanghai have three sayings to describe the development history of bourgeois families: "The first generation calculates without calculating, the second generation wears silk instead of cloth, the third generation wears long gowns but no pants." These sayings are very true and vivid. Capitalists leave their ill-gotten wealth to their descendants, and the result is inevitably misleading their children and grandchildren. What deeply moved the capitalists was that after liberation, this rule changed. Their children did not rely on property but on the education of the Party and the government, and they truly became useful people. Many playboys have turned over a new leaf, learning culture and technology, and are unwilling to follow the dishonorable path taken by their parents. They felt that there was no need to worry about future generations anymore.

　　The Party's policy of peaceful redemption towards private industry and commerce has had a tremendous impact on the Shanghai bourgeoisie. They saw that after public-private partnerships, production developed, enterprises expanded, and capitalists also gained a bright future. Over the past few months, tens of thousands of capitalists in Shanghai have begun new working lives. For capitalists who understand technology, a wider world for applying their skills has unfolded. Elderly, frail, and otherwise troubled capitalists have been properly resettled. Enterprises will also distribute dividends to capitalists for a certain period through fixed interest payments. This has greatly moved the capitalists. Song Baolin, a capitalist from Dacheng Silk Factory, said at a meeting of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress: "The country's meticulous care for us is even more considerate than parents treating their children. If we, the bourgeoisie, still do not abandon the idea of personal wealth and everyone else's misfortune, then we will never gain the understanding of the broad masses of the people, nor will we gain the sympathy of our own children." This is a true expression of the feelings of most capitalists in Shanghai. As a matter of fact, after the capitalists applied for their enterprises to implement public-private partnerships, they received praise from public opinion, relatives and friends came to congratulate them, and children who had not communicated for a long time sent enthusiastic letters of encouragement. The capitalists themselves also felt relaxed and happy, and a new atmosphere of harmony and unity appeared in their families.

　　The great achievements of the socialist transformation policy are concentratedly manifested in the recent socialist upsurge. In the past two months, people who have stepped into Shanghai have been moved by the boiling and jubilant scenes throughout Shanghai. Most capitalists are welcoming public-private partnerships with a positive attitude. Some are investing their private savings in enterprises, and some are helping each other pay off public debts and taxes. They are anxiously waiting day and night for the approval of public-private partnerships, and people applying at the doors of trade associations often form long queues. Many private factories and shops are decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, cleaned up and down, just waiting for the arrival of public representatives. Some people think that since it is a revolution, production will inevitably suffer some confusion and damage. Facts have proved that this is an outdated concept. Recently, the production of all public-private partnership enterprises in Shanghai has not only suffered no damage but has risen sharply.

　　Shanghai is the birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party and a city with a glorious revolutionary tradition. The Shanghai working class has been fighting for decades to eliminate the exploitation system and realize the socialist ideal. How much blood of communists and patriotic people has been shed on the streets of Shanghai. Now, this ideal has finally been realized. By the 20th, all capitalist industry and commerce in Shanghai have been completely transformed into public-private partnerships, the suburbs have been fully collectivized, and the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives have been merged into advanced cooperatives; Shanghai's handicrafts have also achieved cooperativization. The capitalist exploitation system, which once brought so much sin and poverty to this city, has basically withdrawn from the stage of history.

　　The 6 million people of Shanghai are joyfully announcing to the world: they have entered a socialist society.

    踏上了决定性的一步
    本报记者　季音　习平
    1月20日，灯光辉煌的上海中苏友好大厦里举行着一个历史性的会议：上海市资本主义工商业公私合营大会。会场像办大喜事一样，悬挂着红色霓虹灯的大喜字，周围挂着红幔。参加大会的资本家代表和家属们，个个穿着华丽的节日礼服，胸前佩挂红花，脸上掩不住内心的激动和欢悦。
    在暴风雨似的掌声中，上海市资产阶级的代表——上海市工商业联合会主任委员盛丕华，庄重地走上主席台，把金色的总申请书呈递给上海市副市长曹荻秋。曹荻秋代表上海市陈毅市长在申请书上签了字盖了章，正式宣布批准上海市资本主义工商业全部实行公私合营。
    会议从一开始就淹没在连续不断的鼓掌声、欢呼声中，人们几十次地站起来，上百遍地重复地喊着“毛主席万岁”，“共产党万岁”。到了宣布自由发言的时候，扩音机旁排成了长长的队伍，私营工厂的厂长、小商店的主人、资本家的妻子、私营工厂的工人，有的是满头白发，有的只有二十多岁。他们一个紧挨一个地讲，因为时间短促，只能拣最最要紧的话说。于是许多人走到扩音机前，只满怀感激地喊了两句：
    “毛主席万岁！共产党万岁！”
    这感激的声音不只是在大厅里回响着，也在大厦周围守候着的几万工商业者的队伍里回响着，在全市成千上万的私营工厂和商店里、工商业者的家庭里回响着。……
    这是一个多么伟大的事件！把全部资本主义企业转变为半社会主义企业——公私合营，这本是改变生产关系的一个革命。但是，在我们的国家里，这个革命现在却采取这样和平的欢乐的形式完成了。
    上海市私营工商业全部实行公私合营的这个历史性的成就，是经过激烈的斗争以后取得的。只是这个斗争不是采取流血的形式，而是采取人民内部的思想教育和批评和自我批评的形式。几年来，上海私营工商业者不断地受到了党和政府的教育，提高了政治觉悟。从去年11月中华全国工商业联合会第一届执行委员会第二次会议召开之后，这种思想教育和批评和自我批评就更加扩大，内容更加丰富了。上海有17万多资本家和资方代理人参加了这次学习。许多资本家在集会上，在学习小组中，以自己的切身经历，揭发了资本主义剥削制度下人吃人的种种罪恶事实。当然，承认这些事实都是激烈的思想斗争的结果，也是批评和自我批评的结果。他们争执得面红耳赤，多少人终夜辗转不能成眠。上海华丰纺织印染厂、力生机器厂资本家强锡麟说：“解放初期，我听到了工人养活资本家和资本家是剥削者一类名词，实在不服气，总想拿棉花塞住耳朵不要听。”最近，他冷静地算了一笔账：28年前他是20元工钱一个月的小职员，现在他是三个厂的大资本家。假如他在28年中一直是20元一月，即使一个钱也不用，全部存起来，也要经过12，567年的积累，就是说要活12，567岁以上，才能办起这些企业。结果他得出了结论：“事实证明了我所办的企业是从剥削而来的。所谓辛辛苦苦，克勤克俭，只不过是窃取剩余价值的代名词。”
    毛主席关于资产阶级如何掌握自己命运的教导，是最近几个月来上海十几万工商业资本家们学习和进行批评和自我批评的中心。他们描述毛主席的这个教导正如深夜里的一盏明灯给他们照亮了道路。无数痛心的往事都说明过去中国的资产阶级不能掌握自己的命运。抗日战争时期，上海的许多大工商企业都用了巨额的款项，经过贿赂，挂起了美国旗和英国旗，希望借帝国主义的威风来维护自己。但结果太平洋战争一爆发，这些企业依然被另一个帝国主义所吞吃，有的甚至连资本家也遭到日寇的逮捕。大中华橡胶厂资本家洪念祖说：“当我被押解着走过外白渡桥的时候，我悲痛没有国家，没有事业，连本人身家性命也保不住。”
    无数血淋淋的事实重新展现在资本家们的面前。过去多少资产阶级家庭在残酷的倾轧、仇杀中家破人亡。有名的资本家、中国化学工业社总经理方液仙，为了保护自己企业和人身的安全，曾把企业挂上了美国旗，改名为美商美联实业公司，自己入了葡萄牙国籍，又学会了双手放枪，还雇用了两个保镖，时刻跟随周围。但结果他还是被人绑去打死，至今连尸首也没有下落。上海人有三句话，描述资产阶级家庭的发展史：“第一代算进不算出，第二代穿绸不穿布，第三代穿了长衫没有裤。”这几句话是很真实很形象的。资本家把剥削来的不义之财留给后代，结果必然是贻误子孙。使资本家们深深感动的是，解放后这个规律改变了，他们的子弟不是依靠财产，而是依靠了党和政府的教育，真正成了有用的人。不少纨袴子弟都改邪归正，学习文化和技术，不愿再走父母亲走过的不光荣的路。他们感到再没有为后代子孙担忧的必要了。
    党对私营工商业采取的和平赎买的政策，在上海资产阶级中发生了巨大的影响。他们看到企业在公私合营之后，生产发展了，企业扩大了，资本家也得到了光明的出路。几个月来，上海已经有成万的资方实职人员，开始了新的劳动生活。在懂得技术的资本家面前，展开了更广阔的发挥技术的天地。年老力衰和有其他困难的资本家都得到妥善安置。企业在一定时间内还通过定息的办法分给资本家红利。这使资本家们万分感动。大诚绸厂资本家宋保林在上海市人民代表大会的会议上说：“国家对我们这种无微不至的照顾，真比父母对待儿女还要体贴入微，我们资产阶级如果还不抛弃个人发财、众人倒霉的思想，那就决不能获得全国广大人民的谅解，也不能获得自己儿女的同情。”这是上海大多数资本家真实心情的吐露。事实也是如此，资本家们在申请企业实行公私合营以后，他们就得到了社会舆论的赞许，亲戚朋友们纷纷前来道贺，久不通信的儿女寄来了热情鼓励的信件。资本家们自己也轻松愉快，家庭里出现了和睦团结的新气象。
    社会主义改造政策的伟大成就，在最近的社会主义高潮中集中地表现出来。两个月来，踏进上海的人，都为沸腾在全上海的一片欢腾的景象所感动。资本家们大都以积极的态度来迎接公私合营，有的把私人积蓄投资企业，有的互相帮助着还清对公债务和税款。他们日夜焦急地等候批准公私合营，在同业公会的门口申请的人经常排成长长的队伍。许多私营工厂和商店张灯结彩，上下打扫干净，只等公股代表的到来。有人以为既然是革命，终要使生产遭到一些混乱和破坏。事实证明这是陈腐的观念，最近，上海所有的公私合营企业的生产不但没有一点破坏，反而直线地上升。
    上海是中国共产党的诞生地，是有着光荣革命传统的城市。上海工人阶级为着消灭剥削制度，实现社会主义理想，已经奋斗了几十年。在上海马路上，曾经流了多少共产党人和爱国志士的鲜血。现在，这个理想终于实现了。到20日，上海资本主义工商业已全部公私合营，郊区已全部合作化，绝大多数农业社已并成为高级社；上海的手工业也已实现合作化。曾经给这座城市带来了多少罪恶、贫困的资本主义剥削制度，基本上已经退出了历史舞台。
    上海600万人民欢欣鼓舞地向全世界宣告：他们已经进入了社会主义社会。
