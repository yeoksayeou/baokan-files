    Egypt Advances on the Road to Independent Development
    Cui Qi
    On January 16th, Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser announced the draft of Egypt's new constitution at a mass rally in Cairo. This is a historically significant event in the political life of the Egyptian people.
    Since the abdication of King Farouk of Egypt in July 1952, the old Egyptian constitution adopted in 1923 has been abolished. During the transitional period, the Egyptian Republic had adopted an interim constitution. Now, the publication of the new draft constitution marks a new stage of development for the Egyptian Republic.
    Only a few years ago, Egypt was a feudal country enslaved by imperialism. At that time, foreign colonialists ran rampant in Egypt, the feudal ruling class lorded over the people, and the vast majority of the people lived a life of humiliation and disenfranchisement. However, the long-term struggle of the people finally changed the historical face of Egypt. The Egyptian people have shaken off colonial enslavement and overthrown the rule of the feudal monarchy. Especially in recent years, the government and people of the Egyptian Republic have made many efforts and achieved significant successes in opposing colonialism, consolidating national independence, and promoting economic and political development. The new Egyptian constitution was born in this context, and it is the result of the Egyptian people's struggle for freedom and independence.
    One of the most important principles embodied in the new Egyptian constitution is that Egypt is an independent and sovereign country. The new constitution stipulates that Egypt is an Arab country. The state system is republican. The state religion is Islam. The official national language is Arabic.
    The new constitution also stipulates that legislative power belongs to the National Assembly, with a term of five years. The head of state is the President of the Republic, nominated by the National Assembly and elected by national referendum for a term of six years. The President serves as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and he has the power to declare war or conclude treaties with the consent of the National Assembly, but these treaties must be ratified by the parliament.
    The new constitution declares that all people, regardless of race, language, or religious belief, are equal before the law, and abolishes the titles and privileges of royalty and nobility. Citizens have freedom of speech, freedom of publication and the press, as well as the right to association and the right to vote.
    In terms of social and economic systems, the constitution stipulates that cooperative economic activities are encouraged to establish a solid foundation for the national economy, to ensure the "coordination" of private initiative with overall economic activities, to protect private property, but at the same time to limit the amount of land ownership.
    It can be seen from these articles that the new constitution has progressive anti-colonial and anti-feudal significance. Therefore, this new draft constitution has been endorsed by the Egyptian people. These days, they are discussing the contents of this draft constitution. Egypt is preparing to hold a referendum on June 23 to decide on the entry into force of the new constitution.
    The announcement of Egypt's new constitution has also been valued and welcomed in other Arab countries. Egypt's steps towards national rejuvenation and social progress have had a positive impact on the people of Arab countries and have contributed to the unity and cooperation of the people of Eastern countries.
    Needless to say, Western colonial countries are unwilling to see Egypt moving forward on the road of independent development. They still regard the Middle East and Near East countries as spheres of influence of Western countries and want to use the method of organizing military blocs in combination with economic aggression to regain their lost colonial positions. However, in our time, once a nation gains freedom, it will be free forever. Egypt's path forward cannot be blocked by any reactionary force.

    埃及在独立发展的道路上迈进
    崔奇
    1月16日，埃及总理纳赛尔在开罗群众大会上宣布了埃及的新宪法草案。这是埃及人民政治生活中具有历史意义的事件。
    自从1952年7月埃及国王法鲁克被罢黜以后，1923年通过的埃及旧宪法就作废了。在过渡期间，埃及共和国曾经通过一项临时宪法。现在，新宪法草案的公布，标志着埃及共和国走上了一个新的发展阶段。
    仅仅在几年以前，埃及还是帝国主义奴役下的一个封建国家。那时候，外国殖民者在埃及横行霸道，封建统治阶级压在人民的头上作威作福，广大人民则过着屈辱无权的生活。但是，人民的长期斗争终于改变了埃及的历史面貌。埃及人民已经摆脱了殖民奴役，并推翻了封建王室的统治。特别是最近几年来，埃及共和国政府和人民，为了反对殖民主义，巩固民族独立，并促进经济和政治的发展，作了许多努力，获得了重大的成就。埃及的新宪法就是在这种情况下诞生的，它是埃及人民争取自由独立斗争的结果。
    埃及新宪法所体现的一个最重要原则是：埃及是独立自主的国家。新宪法规定，埃及是一个阿拉伯国家。国家制度是共和制。国家宗教是伊斯兰教。正式的国家语言是阿拉伯文。
    新宪法并规定，立法权属于国民议会，议会任期五年。国家元首是共和国总统，由国民议会提名，经全国公民投票选举产生，任期六年。总统担任武装部队总司令，他有权在国民议会同意下宣战或缔结条约，但这些条约必须得到议会的批准。
    新宪法宣布，一切人，不分种族、语言和宗教信仰，在法律面前一律平等，废除王室、贵族的爵位和特权。公民有言论自由，出版和新闻自由，以及结社权和投票权。
    在社会和经济制度方面，宪法规定，鼓励合作性质的经济活动，建立民族经济的巩固基础，保证“协调”私人积极性同总的经济活动，保护私人财产，但同时限制地产的数量。
    从这些条文中可以看出，新宪法具有反殖民主义和反封建主义的进步意义。因此，这个新宪法草案受到了埃及国民的拥护。这些天来，他们正在讨论这个宪法草案的内容。埃及全国准备在6月23日举行公民投票来决定新宪法的生效。
    埃及新宪法的宣布，在其他阿拉伯国家也受到重视和欢迎。埃及走向民族复兴和社会进步的步骤，对阿拉伯各国人民产生了积极的影响，并有助于东方各国人民的团结合作。
    不消说，西方殖民国家是不愿意看到埃及沿着独立发展的道路前进的。他们直到现在还把中近东国家看作是西方国家的势力范围，并想利用组织军事集团同经济侵略相配合的办法，夺回已经失去的殖民阵地。但是，在我们的时代，任何一个民族，一旦获得自由，就会永远自由。埃及的前进道路是任何反动势力阻塞不了的。
