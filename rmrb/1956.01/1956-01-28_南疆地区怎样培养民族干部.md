How to Cultivate Ethnic Minority Cadres in Southern Xinjiang
Qi Guo, Third Secretary of the CPC Southern Xinjiang Regional Committee

By the end of 1955, the number of semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives in the Southern Xinjiang region of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region had reached 3,760, with member households accounting for 17.89% of the total number of households. The development and consolidation of these cooperative organizations mainly relies on local ethnic minority cadres. Therefore, the achievement of this great success is inseparable from the vigorous cultivation and bold promotion of ethnic minority cadres. According to recent statistics, there are a total of 22,167 cadres at or above the township level who are detached from or semi-detached from production in the region, of which 16,227 are ethnic minority cadres, accounting for 73.2%. All township-level party and administrative organizations are composed of ethnic minority cadres. More than 90% of the cadres in district-level agencies are ethnic minority cadres, and ethnic minority cadres generally account for about 70% in county-level agencies. The vast majority of the main responsible cadres of administrative organizations at all levels are ethnic minority cadres. Local ethnic minority cadres also account for a considerable proportion of the members of party organizations at all levels. For example, out of 218 county committee members, 69 are ethnic minority cadres, accounting for 31.6%. More gratifying is that in recent years, due to the improvement of the policy level and work ability of ethnic minority cadres, the number of ethnic minority cadres who can independently undertake leadership work is increasing.

Under the correct leadership of the CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Regional Committee (formerly the CPC Central Committee Xinjiang Branch), the CPC Southern Xinjiang Regional Committee has always attached importance to the work of cultivating ethnic minority cadres. We constantly emphasize among Han cadres the need to oppose Han chauvinism, criticize various views that discriminate against ethnic minority cadres and the work style of doing everything for them, and educate cadres with Marxism-Leninism and the party's ethnic policies. In July 1952, the Second Representative Conference convened by the former CPC Central Committee Xinjiang Branch focused on criticizing Han chauvinism among Han cadres. Party organizations at all levels in the Southern Xinjiang region conscientiously conveyed the spirit of this conference, and at the same time inspected ethnic relations and cadre unity, so that the struggle against Han chauvinism penetrated into the party's grassroots organizations and every cadre. Through this ideological struggle, most Han cadres understood the importance of cultivating and relying on ethnic minority cadres; realized that any work in ethnic minority areas cannot be successful without ethnic minority cadres; and that ignoring ethnic characteristics and not trusting and respecting local ethnic minority cadres, no matter what their subjective intentions are, is essentially a manifestation of Han chauvinism. The Han nationality is the main nationality in China, therefore Han cadres must first take the responsibility of opposing Han chauvinism in order to better influence and promote local ethnic minority cadres to oppose local nationalism. This conference promoted the ethnic unity, cadre unity, and especially the work of cultivating ethnic minority cadres in the Southern Xinjiang region to a new stage. In subsequent party conferences, the spirit of this conference was used as a guiding ideology to repeatedly inspect and criticize Han chauvinism, and attention was paid to the use and cultivation of ethnic minority cadres in actual work. In 1954, the spirit of the decision of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party was conveyed, and a serious inspection was conducted among Han leading cadres. There is no doubt that without this series of ideological struggles, and without opposing Han chauvinism among Han cadres, the growth of ethnic minority cadres would be seriously hindered.

In his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Let them do it, learn lessons in the process of doing it, and increase their talents. In this way, a large number of outstanding people will emerge. An attitude of fearing the dragon in front and the tiger behind cannot cultivate cadres." These words summarize the main experience of our party in cultivating cadres over the years. In ethnic minority areas, it is even more necessary to emphasize opposing the idealistic view of waiting for cadres to gain experience and talent before using them. For ethnic minority cadres, as long as their essence is good, their history is clear, and they have the potential to be cultivated, they should be boldly promoted to leading positions and let them be tempered and improved in their work. Only in this way can we adapt to the needs of the work. All the work carried out by the party in ethnic minority areas is new, and of course it is impossible for cadres of all ethnic groups to have mature experience in advance. The vast majority of ethnic minority cadres joined the revolution after the liberation of Xinjiang at the end of 1949. Due to the limitations of literacy and work experience, etc., it is impossible to demand ethnic minority cadres with the standards required of Han cadres. Experience proves that the area that relies on ethnic minority cadres in its work and boldly promotes ethnic minority cadres is vibrant and at the forefront; conversely, the area that is constrained, fearing the dragon in front and the tiger behind, and dare not boldly promote ethnic minority cadres, sees its work stagnate and fall into a passive position. Experience also proves that after ethnic minority cadres are promoted, their policy level and work ability can be gradually improved after a certain period of training, and they can gradually become competent in their work. The more the leadership lets go, the stronger the cadres' sense of responsibility becomes. We have seen that many cadres were ordinary peasants at the time of the initial liberation, and now they have been promoted to county heads and county party secretaries; some cadres who were originally engaged in general work have now been promoted to commissioner-level cadres. Because they actively study hard, these promoted cadres generally successfully complete their work. The role of grassroots ethnic minority cadres is also significantly strengthened. Many branches that have been newly established for less than a year have independently led the work of establishing cooperatives, solving the difficulty of insufficient leadership in the great development of the cooperative movement, which is a powerful criticism of those who have conservative ideas on the issue of leadership in the cooperative movement.

In addition to boldly promoting and using ethnic minority cadres, it is also necessary to give them practical help in cultivating them. It is necessary to educate them through various forms to improve their political awareness, policy level, and work ability. Party committees at all levels in Southern Xinjiang have opened a large number of short-term training classes to train primary cadres for various tasks. In the land reform, the form of work teams was adopted to train a large number of rural activists, most of whom have now become cadres in various positions and backbones in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. At the same time, party committees at all levels have regular or irregular work inspection and summary systems, using the method of constantly summarizing experience to improve the level of cadres. Various meetings should absorb ethnic minority cadres as much as possible. The leadership's instructions and intentions should be made known to ethnic minority cadres as soon as possible. The Second Representative Conference convened by the former CPC Central Committee Xinjiang Branch decided that all Han cadres working in Xinjiang have a dual task: on the one hand, they must do their own work well, and on the other hand, they must help ethnic minority cadres do their work well. Party committees at all levels in Southern Xinjiang faithfully implement this instruction. The party constantly educates Han cadres to strengthen their sense of responsibility for helping ethnic minority cadres.

In educating and helping ethnic minority cadres, it is necessary to pay attention to ethnic characteristics. We must be considerate of the feelings and practical difficulties of ethnic minority cadres. We should adopt the method of more praise and less criticism to encourage the enthusiasm of ethnic minority cadres. If ethnic minority cadres have shortcomings and mistakes, we must be good at inspiring them to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and criticism and handling should be carried out as much as possible through ethnic minority leading cadres. We should also pay attention to respecting the religious beliefs and different customs of ethnic minority cadres.

While educating and promoting ethnic minority cadres, we must pay attention to the party building work in ethnic minority areas. At present, there are 1,118 party branches and 12,643 party members in the region, of which 10,464 are local ethnic minority party members; there are 1,812 league branches and 32,555 league members in the region, of which more than 92% are ethnic minority league members. The growth of ethnic minority cadres is inseparable from the direct education and help of party and league organizations.

    南疆地区怎样培养民族干部
    中共南疆区委员会第三书记　祁果
    新疆维吾尔自治区南疆地区的半社会主义的农业生产合作社，到1955年底止已经发展到3，760个，入社农户已经达到总农户的17.89％。这些合作组织的发展和巩固，主要是依靠本地民族干部来进行的。因此，这一巨大成绩的获得，是同大力培养和大胆提拔民族干部分不开的。根据最近的统计：全区乡以上脱离生产和半脱离生产的干部共22，167名，其中民族干部就有16，227名，占73.2％。乡级党和行政组织全部是由民族干部组成的，区级机关内90％以上是民族干部，县级机关内民族干部一般占70％左右。各级行政组织的主要负责干部绝大多数是由民族干部担任的。各级党组织的委员中，本地民族干部也占了相当的比重。例如，县委委员218名，其中民族干部有69名，占31.6％。更可喜的是，近年来由于民族干部的政策水平和工作能力的提高，能独立担负领导工作的民族干部日益增多。
    中共南疆区委员会在中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会（前中共中央新疆分局）的正确领导下，一向重视培养民族干部的工作。我们不断地在汉族干部中，强调反对大民族主义思想，批判各种歧视民族干部的观点和包办代替的作风，以马克思列宁主义的思想和党的民族政策来教育干部。1952年7月，前中共中央新疆分局召开的第二届代表会议，集中地批判了汉族干部中的大民族主义思想。南疆地区各级党的组织，认真地将这次会议的精神进行了传达，同时并检查了民族关系和干部团结问题，使反对大民族主义思想的斗争一直深入到党的基层组织和每一个干部。通过这次思想斗争，使大多数汉族干部都懂得了培养和依靠民族干部的重要性；认识了民族地区的任何一项工作，离开了民族干部，是不能成功的；忽视民族特点，不信任和不尊重本地民族干部，不论其主观上如何，在实质上都是一种大民族主义的思想倾向；汉族是中国境内的主要民族，因此汉族干部必须首先担负起反对大民族主义的责任，才能很好地影响和推动本地民族干部反对地方民族主义。这次会议，使南疆地区的民族团结、干部团结，特别是培养民族干部的工作，推进到新的阶段。以后党的历次会议，都以这次会议的精神为指导思想，反复地检查和批判大民族主义思想，并且在实际工作中注意了民族干部的使用和培养。1954年传达党的七届四中全会决议的精神，又在汉族领导干部中进行了一次严肃的检查。毫无疑问，没有这一系列的思想斗争，不反对汉族干部中的大民族主义思想，民族干部的成长，便会受到严重的阻碍。
    毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中说：“要让他们做，在做的中间得到教训，增长才干。这样，大批的优秀人物就会产生。前怕龙后怕虎的态度不能造就干部。”这几句话总结了我党多年来培养干部的主要经验。在少数民族地区，更必须强调反对等待干部有了经验和才干再去使用他们的唯心主义观点。对民族干部，只要本质好，历史清楚，有培养前途，就应当放手地提拔他们到领导岗位上去，让他们在工作中锻炼和提高。只有这样才能适应工作的需要。党在民族地区进行的各项工作，都是新的，各族干部当然不可能事先都有成熟的经验。民族干部绝大多数都是1949年底新疆解放以后参加革命的，由于文字及工作经历等等的限制，不能拿要求汉族干部的尺度来要求民族干部。经验证明：那个地区在工作中依靠民族干部，大胆放手提拔民族干部，那里的工作就生气勃勃，走在前面；反之，那里束手束脚，前怕龙，后怕虎，不敢大胆提拔民族干部，那个地方的工作就迟滞不前，陷于被动。经验也证明：民族干部提拔起来之后，经过一定时期的锻炼，政策水平和工作能力是可以逐步提高的，他们是可以逐步胜任自己的工作的。领导上越放手，干部的责任心就越强。我们看到，有很多干部，在初解放的时候，是一个普通农民，而现在已被提拔为县长、县委书记；有些原来是担任一般工作的干部，现在已经提拔为专员级的干部。由于他们积极钻研，这些提拔起来的干部一般都胜利地完成了自己的工作。基层民族干部的作用也在显著加强。有许多新建不到一年的支部，都独立领导了建社工作，解决了合作化运动大发展中领导力量不足的困难，这是对那些在合作化运动的领导问题上存有保守思想的人的一个有力的批判。
    培养民族干部，除了大胆提拔和使用以外，还必须给他们以切实的帮助。要通过多种多样的形式向他们进行教育，提高他们的政治觉悟、政策水平和工作能力。南疆各级党委曾经大量地开办短期训练班，以训练各项工作的初级干部。土地改革中，采用了工作队这一形式，训练了大批农村积极分子，现在他们大多数都成了各种岗位上的干部和互助合作运动中的骨干。同时，各级党委都有定期的或不定期的工作检查总结制度，用不断总结经验的方法来提高干部水平。各种会议应当尽量地吸收民族干部参加。领导方面的一切指示和意图，都要及早让民族干部知道。前中共中央新疆分局召开的第二届代表会议决定，一切在新疆工作的汉族干部，负有双重任务，一方面要做好自己的工作，另一方面要帮助民族干部做好工作。南疆各级党委忠实地执行着这一指示。党经常地教育汉族干部，要加强帮助民族干部的责任心。
    教育和帮助民族干部必须注意民族特点。必须体贴民族干部的心情和实际困难。要采用多表扬、少批评的办法以鼓励民族干部的积极性。民族干部有了缺点和错误，要善于启发他们进行批评和自我批评，批评和处理要尽量通过民族领导干部去进行。还要注意尊重民族干部的宗教信仰和不同的风俗习惯。
    与教育和提拔民族干部同时，必须注意民族地区的建党工作。现在，全区共有党的支部1，118个，党员12，643人，其中当地民族党员为10，464人；全区共有团的支部1，812个，团员32，555人，其中92％以上是少数民族团员。民族干部的成长，同党、团组织的直接教育和帮助是分不开的。
