The Benefits of Unified Allocation of Construction Machinery and Equipment

Lu Zhongfei

Wuhan is one of the key construction cities of the country. The projects under construction and about to be constructed include Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, thermal power plants, heavy-duty machine tool factories, boiler factories, meat joint processing plants, and the Yangtze River Bridge. These projects are all large-scale and adopt mechanized and factory-based construction methods.

In April last year, when the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee Basic Construction Office comprehensively compiled the 1955 work plan to support key construction projects, it found relatively serious problems in the use and management of construction machinery and equipment by various construction units in Wuhan. There were more than ten major machinery supply units in the Wuhan area, owning 68 types of machinery, totaling 2,444 units. This was a considerable force. However, there were many shortcomings in its use and management.

First, the supply of construction machinery was not organized, and a unified regional balance and adjustment was not implemented. The machinery of each unit was generally only for its own use, and the existing equipment capacity could not be well utilized. When other construction units needed certain machinery, they sent people to inquire everywhere, but still could not borrow it.

Second, the utilization rate of machinery and equipment was low, generally only about 30%. Coupled with poor management, the phenomenon of work stoppages and waste was serious. The Wuhan Mechanical Construction Station of the Ministry of Construction Engineering suffered a loss of 210,000 yuan due to mechanical work stoppages in the first half of 1955. An 8-ton crane from the First Engineering Department of the Central South Engineering Administration was idle on the construction site for 3 months, with transportation costs alone amounting to 1,900 yuan; a 5-ton winch and a 30-ton crane were each used for only 3 shifts; other large and small machinery were severely overstocked, with estimated waste of more than 10,000 yuan.

Third, the machinery purchase plans and vertical system scheduling plans of various units often had considerable blindness. According to a survey, only 1,194 of the more than 2,400 pieces of machinery were commonly used. Some machinery, such as the sheep's foot roller produced by a certain factory in Beijing, was not very suitable for the Jiangnan area due to its slender foot teeth, but many units in Wuhan purchased it. Some machinery was insufficient when urgently needed for rush tasks, but became overstocked after the rush. Since the launch of the comprehensive conservation campaign and the reduction of non-productive construction costs, earthwork machinery such as mixers and road rollers have also been used less. Earthwork machinery such as excavators, bulldozers, scrapers, and dump trucks were insufficient because several key projects were carrying out large-scale land leveling at the same time.

Fourth, the production quotas, management systems, rental methods, and fee standards of various machinery supply units in Wuhan were extremely inconsistent. This had caused some disputes among the construction units, affecting unity and mutual cooperation. Some units, because they disliked the high cost of renting machinery, preferred to use manual labor instead of machinery.

In response to these situations, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee decided to establish a regional unified allocation organization for construction machinery, and determined the policy of "organizing, exchanging what one has for what one needs, unified allocation, rational use, and vigorously supporting various key construction projects centered on Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation." The specific approach was: to establish a "Wuhan Municipal Construction Machinery and Equipment Unified Allocation Office" and set up a chief dispatcher. All construction machinery supply units in the Wuhan area, in addition to being directly led by their superior authorities, established business ties with the unified allocation office and implemented the systems it stipulated. All kinds of construction machinery could usually meet the needs of the unit itself as a priority, and the idle parts were mutually adjusted for use. At a certain time, the unified allocation office presided over a balance scheduling meeting attended by representatives of more than a dozen larger machinery supply units in the city, and each unit was responsible for submitting a machinery supply and demand balance plan on schedule, stating what machinery they had, which were in use, which were about to be used, which were being repaired, and for what reasons they requested the transfer of which machinery. After exchanging information at the joint scheduling meeting, the balance plan or scheduling plan proposed by the unified allocation office was fully discussed and a resolution was made. The unified allocation office further guided the various units to conduct specific consultations separately, and concluded agreement contracts where conditions permitted. As for the management system, production quotas, rental and fee regulations of the relevant machinery and equipment, they would still be temporarily implemented according to the methods of each supply unit, and the leasing and renting units would directly settle their accounts.

Since the establishment of the Wuhan Municipal Construction Machinery and Equipment Unified Allocation Office, thanks to the support and cooperation of various machinery supply units, it has basically figured out the inventory of construction machinery and equipment, and has a dedicated agency to keep abreast of the increase, decrease, and use of machinery at any time, to carry out balance scheduling, improve the utilization rate of machinery, and reduce work stoppages and overstocking. For example, when the First Mechanical Construction Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering established the Wuhan Construction Station in April 1955, it transferred a large number of machinery to contract for the land leveling task of the Wuhan Heavy-Duty Machine Tool Factory. However, due to the revision of the design drawings, the construction period was delayed, and all kinds of machinery were completely idled, resulting in great losses. Later, with the strong assistance of the unified allocation office, the overstocked scrapers, bulldozers, road rollers, and heavy-duty vehicles were allocated to other units for use, greatly reducing losses and waste. The 9 bulldozers and excavators that had been idle for a long time by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission did not have the opportunity to be put into production until the unified allocation office was established. In 3 months, the machinery allocated by the unified allocation office to the construction projects of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, thermal power plants, and heavy-duty machine tool factories included six or seventy units of soil tractors, scrapers, excavators, soil looseners, tractors, and sheep's foot rollers, which strongly supported these key projects.

Through the unified allocation of construction machinery, the planning and management work of the relevant machinery supply units has also been promoted, reducing the blindness and chaos in the machinery purchase plan and the vertical system scheduling plan, and pointing out the direction for further organizing regional construction auxiliary enterprise cooperation, industrial production cooperation, and technical cooperation in the future.

    统一调配施工机械设备的好处
    陆锺斐
    武汉是国家重点建设的城市之一。正在兴建和即将兴建的工程有武汉钢铁公司、热电站、重型工具机厂、锅炉厂、肉类联合加工厂和长江大桥等。这些工程都是规模巨大，采用机械化、工厂化施工方法进行施工的。
    去年4月，武汉市人民委员会基本建设办公室综合编制1955年支援重点建设工作计划的时候，发现武汉市各建设单位在施工机械设备的使用和管理上有比较严重的问题。武汉地区内较大的机械供应单位共十多个，拥有各类机具68种，共2，444台。这是一支相当强大的力量。但是在使用和管理上有很多缺点。
    首先是施工机具供应工作没有组织起来，没有实行统一的地区性的平衡调剂。各单位的机具一般只供自己使用，现有设备能力不能很好发挥。而另一些建设单位需要某种机具的时候又派人到处奔走打听，还是借不到。
    其次是机具设备利用率低，一般只达30％左右，加上经营管理不善，窝工浪费现象严重。建筑工程部武汉机械施工站1955年上半年机械窝工损失达21万元。中南工程管理局第一工程处一部8吨的起重机在工地闲置3个月，仅运输费就损失1，900元；5吨卷扬机和30吨吊车各一部，只用过3个台班；其它大小机具积压都很严重，估计浪费达一万多元。
    第三是各单位的机具购置计划和垂直系统内的机具调度计划往往带有较大的盲目性。据调查，在2，400多件机具中，常用的仅1，194件。有的机械如北京某厂所产的羊趾碾因足齿细长，在江南地区很不适用，但是武汉市有不少单位都买了。有些机具在突击任务急需的时候不够用，突击以后便积压起来。自从展开全面节约运动和降低非生产性建筑造价后，拌合机、压路机等土建机械使用得也不多。挖土机、推土机、铲运机、自卸汽车等土方机械，则因为有几个重点工程同时进行大规模的平土工程而不够用。
    第四是武汉市各机械供应单位在生产定额、管理制度、租赁办法和取费标准等方面极不统一。这曾造成各建设单位之间的一些争执，影响团结和相互协作。有些单位因为嫌租用的机具贵，宁愿用人工来代替机械。
    针对这些情况，中共武汉市委和武汉市人民委员会决定建立施工机具地区性的统一调配组织，确定了“组织起来，互通有无，统一调配，合理使用，大力支援以武汉钢铁公司为中心的各项重点建设工程”的方针。具体做法是：成立“武汉市施工机械设备统一调配处”，设置总调度员。武汉地区各施工机械供应单位除直接由他们上级机关领导外，都跟统一调配处建立业务联系，执行它所规定的制度。各种施工机具在通常情况下可以尽先满足本单位的需要，把闲置部分互相调剂使用。一定时期，由统一调配处主持召开有本市十几个较大的机具供应单位代表参加的平衡调度会议，责成各单位按期提出机具供需平衡计划，载明有些什么机具，哪些正在使用，哪些准备使用，哪些正在检修，以及由于什么原因要求调入哪些机具等。在联合调度会议上交换情况以后，根据统一调配处提出的平衡方案或调度计划进行充分讨论，作出决议。统一调配处进一步指导各单位分别进行具体协商，凡有条件的就订立协议合同。至于有关机具设备的管理制度、生产定额、租赁和取费等规定，仍暂按各供应单位的办法执行，由出租、承租单位直接结算账务。
    武汉市施工机械设备统一调配处成立以来，由于各机具供应单位的支持和协作，基本上摸清了施工机械设备的家底，并且有专责机构随时掌握机具的增减和使用情况，进行平衡调度，提高了机具的使用率，减少了窝工积压。如建筑工程部第一机械施工公司1955年4月间成立武汉施工站的时候，曾调来大批机具，承包武汉市重型工具机厂厂区平整任务。但是因为修改设计图纸，工期推迟，各种机具全部窝工，损失很大。后来经统一调配处大力协助，才把积压的铲运机、推土机、压路机、载重汽车等分别调剂给别的单位使用，大大地减轻了损失浪费。长江水利委员会长期闲置的9台推土机和挖土机，直到统一调配处成立后，才得到机会投入生产。3个月中，经统一调配处调配给武汉钢铁公司、热电站和重型工具机厂建厂工程的机具，有拖土机、铲运机、挖土机、松土机、拖拉机、羊趾碾等六、七十台，有力地支援了这些重点工程。
    通过施工机具的统一调配工作，还推动各有关机具供应单位改善了计划和管理工作，减轻了机具购置计划和垂直系统调度计划中的盲目和混乱情况，并且为今后准备进一步组织地区性的施工附属企业协作、工业生产协作和技术协作等指出了方向。
