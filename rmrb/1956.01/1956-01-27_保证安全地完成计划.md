    Ensure the Safe Completion of the Plan
    Currently, some factories and mines, when compiling their 1956 production, technology, and financial plans, only pay attention to the value of production and output plans, and do not attach importance to safety technology measures plans. Among 114 factories in Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, and Jiamusi cities in Heilongjiang Province, 45 factories have not prepared safety technology measures plans. The lead poisoning of workers in the casting workshop of the local state-owned Mudanjiang Printing Factory is very serious, but the leaders of this factory believe that this problem cannot be solved and do not intend to solve it.
    It is one of the management principles of socialist enterprises to ensure that workers produce safely. This year's production and construction tasks are unprecedentedly heavy, which makes it even more necessary to pay attention to improving workers' working conditions and to prevent accidents. Compiling safety technology measures plans can allow for advance planning and proper arrangement of this work. This is one of the basic conditions for ensuring the smooth completion of this year's plan, and all enterprises must, without exception, compile it in a timely manner!

    保证安全地完成计划
    目前有一些厂矿企业在编制1956年的生产技术财务计划的时候，只注意了产值、产量计划，没有重视安全技术措施计划。黑龙江省齐齐哈尔、牡丹江、佳木斯三市114个工厂，就有45个工厂没有编制安全技术措施计划。地方国营牡丹江印刷厂铸造车间工人铅中毒现象十分严重，这个厂的领导人员却认为这个问题不能解决，也不打算解决。
    必须保证工人安全地生产，这是社会主义企业的管理原则之一。今年的生产建设任务空前加重，就更加需要重视改善工人的劳动条件，更加注意防止事故。而编制安全技术措施计划，就可以对这项工作预作筹划，妥善安排。这是保证顺利完成今年计划的基本条件之一，各个企业必须无例外地及时地把它编好！
