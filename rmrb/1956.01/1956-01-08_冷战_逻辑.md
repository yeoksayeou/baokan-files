　　The Logic of the "Cold War"

　　The "Christian Science Monitor's" reporter, Harsch, read the joint communiqué issued by Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev and Indian Prime Minister Nehru after their visit to India, and like many in the American ruling circles, felt very uncomfortable as if he had been struck with a club. His concern for the future of American aggression in Asia made it necessary for him to come out and vehemently criticize Nehru.

　　However, Harsch could not find an excuse to criticize him. Because, as he admitted, there was little in the joint communiqué that Nehru "had not said in previous public statements." So he applied a strange logic, which is that "it is one thing for Nehru to say these things himself, and quite another for him to say these words in conjunction with the Soviet Union and in such a document." According to this logic, Harsch has something to work with.

　　Harsch said, for example, on the issue of restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, "if Nehru privately expressed regret to Washington about this delay, it would not seem non-neutral. His expressing regret publicly himself only indicates that he is slightly non-neutral. But his doing so in conjunction with the Soviet Union undoubtedly exceeds the bounds of neutrality." For example, regarding the obstacles to implementing the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, Harsch believes that it "would not be non-neutral for Nehru to express his views to Washington privately. It is non-neutral for him to express agreement with the Soviet Union in a public statement."

　　Obviously, Harsch's logic is the "Cold War" logic that the United States has long used. According to this logic, anyone who is dissatisfied with the United States' aggressive activities that undermine peace, and anyone who expresses a desire for peace like the Soviet Union and China, will be attacked as a communist. To the regret of people like Harsch, the United States has not yet been able to come up with an organization in the international arena like the so-called "Un-American Activities Committee," which runs rampant in the United States, to conduct so-called "loyalty investigations" on all countries willing to be peaceful and neutral.

　　Harsch said that the reason he said Nehru's actions were non-neutral was because it would "increase the Washington government's difficulties and embarrassment on this issue."

　　It is true that the face of the Washington government may be what Harsch wants to defend. But the main purpose of Harsch's unfounded accusations against Nehru is to list India along with the Soviet Union as an object of the "Cold War," attempting to use this threat to force countries like India to abandon their policy of neutrality. Harsch's plan only shows that he, like some people in Washington, lives in the 1950s but is still dreaming 19th-century dreams.

### “冷战”逻辑

　　“冷战”逻辑
    美国“基督教科学箴言报”的记者哈希读了访问印度的苏联领袖布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫和印度总理尼赫鲁发表的联合公报，和美国统治集团中的许多人一样，像吃了一闷棍似的觉得很不舒服。对于美国侵略亚洲的前途的担心，使得他认为有必要出来对尼赫鲁大加指责。
    但是哈希找不到可以进行指责的借口。因为正如他所承认的，联合公报中很少东西是尼赫鲁“在以前的公开声明中没有说过的”。于是他就应用了一种奇怪的逻辑，这就是“尼赫鲁自己说这些事情是一回事，他同苏联联合起来说这些话并且在这样一个文件中说这些话完全是另一回事”。按照这个逻辑，哈希就有文章做了。
    哈希说，例如在恢复中国在联合国的合法地位问题上，“如果尼赫鲁对于这种拖延私下向华盛顿表示遗憾，那并不会显得不中立的。他自己公开表示遗憾只表示他略微有些不中立。但是他同苏联联合起来这样做，毫无疑问他已经超越了中立的范围了”。又例如，关于在越南实行日内瓦协议方面的障碍问题，哈希认为，尼赫鲁“私下对华盛顿表示他的意见也不会是不中立的。他在一个公开声明中表示同苏联意见一致是不中立的”。
    显然，哈希的逻辑是美国用之已久的“冷战”逻辑。按照这种逻辑，谁要是不满意美国的破坏和平的侵略活动，谁要是同苏联、中国一样表示对于和平的愿望，他就要被当作共产党来攻击。使哈希之流感到遗憾的是：美国在国际上还拿不出像在美国国内横行无忌的所谓“非美活动委员会”那样的机构，来对一切愿意和平中立的国家进行所谓“忠诚调查”。
    哈希说，他之所以要说尼赫鲁这样做是不中立的，是因为这会“增加华盛顿政府在这个问题上的困难和难堪”。
    不错，华盛顿政府的面子也许是哈希所要卫护的东西。但是哈希对尼赫鲁的凭空指责的主要目的，是想把印度同苏联一起列作“冷战”的对象，企图用这种威胁来迫使像印度这样的国家放弃它的中立政策。哈希的这种打算只是说明了他像华盛顿的某些人一样，活在20世纪的50年代，却还在做19世纪的梦。
