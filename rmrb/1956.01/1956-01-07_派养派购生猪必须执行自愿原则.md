Recently, major pig-producing areas have strengthened the work of assigning households to raise and sell pigs to the state. After mid-December 1955, the national daily purchase volume of pigs has increased to 80,000 heads, three times more than in early November 1955. This is the result of many comrades engaged in this work patiently educating farmers and conscientiously implementing the policy of assigning pig raising and sales.

However, some comrades in some areas, in carrying out the work of assigning households to raise and sell pigs, did not realize that this is a complex, meticulous work involving a wide range of issues. They adopted crude, simplistic, and even coercive methods. For example, in Xueping Township, Nanzhang County, Hubei Province, a lottery method was used: whoever drew the lot had to sell a pig. The woman Yan Lejin did not have a pig, but she drew the lot, so she had to go to another place to buy one to fulfill the task, resulting in a loss of nine yuan. In the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Taizhou Township, Yidu County, there were 48 households with 38 fattened pigs. A staff member of the purchase working group, when mobilizing people to "voluntarily undertake," did not publicize the specific content of the policy of assigning households to raise and sell pigs. Instead, he used the coercive method of "no adjournment until the task is completed," demanding that all 38 households sell their pigs, which aroused dissatisfaction among the farmers, even affecting the winter planting production the next day.

The policy of assigning households to raise and sell pigs must be implemented in accordance with the principle of voluntarism, so that farmers consciously undertake the task of assigning households to raise and sell pigs. Some purchase staff members believe that since it is an "assignment," there can be no talk of "voluntarism," which is incorrect. The actual experience in many areas has proven this point: the implementation of assigning households to raise and sell pigs can be done in a way that is both in line with the interests of the state and with the personal interests of the farmers. Yidu County in Hubei Province is a good example. This county once conducted full publicity and mobilization for the assigning of pig raising and sales in 136 townships, publicizing the policy to every household. Recently, farmers in many townships have voluntarily and actively sold pigs. This fact shows that as long as farmers understand the Party's policy, they will consciously accept the task of assigning households to raise and sell pigs.

Simply publicizing the policy is not enough. Farmers may have many different ideological concerns about selling pigs, and specific work should be done for each of them. If farmers are worried that they will not have meat to eat after selling pigs, then the preferential treatment measures for keeping meat and oil should be explained clearly. If farmers are worried that they will not be able to buy piglets after selling large pigs, then the supply of piglets should be effectively organized. As for some areas where private merchants have penetrated into farmers' households, engaging in black market price gouging activities, which has caused a small number of farmers to be unwilling to sell to the state at the listed price, the activities of private merchants should be exposed to the farmers on the one hand; on the other hand, the management and socialist transformation of private slaughterers should be strengthened to restrict and eliminate illegal black market speculation.

　　派养派购生猪必须执行自愿原则
    重益
    最近，在生猪的主要产区都加强了派养派购工作。进入1955年12月中旬以后，全国生猪的每日收购量已经提高到八万头，比1955年11月初旬多三倍。这是许多从事这项工作的同志耐心地对农民进行教育，认真执行生猪的派养派购政策的结果。
    但是，有些地区的同志，在执行生猪派养派购工作中，没有认识到这是一件复杂细致、牵涉面很广的工作，采取了粗糙的、简单的、甚至是强迫命令的方法。如湖北南漳县薛平乡用抽签办法，谁抽着签，谁卖猪。妇女阎乐瑾没有猪，抽中了签，只好到外地去买了一头来抵交任务，结果亏赔九元钱。宜都县太州乡第一农业生产合作社共48户，养有38头肥猪。派购工作组的一位工作人员，在开会动员“自认”的时候，不宣传派养派购政策的具体内容，用“不完成任务不散会”的强迫办法，要求38家全部把猪卖出来，引起农民的不满，连第二天的冬播生产也受了影响。
    执行生猪的派养派购政策必须贯彻执行自愿的原则，使农民自觉地担负派养、派购任务。有些派购工作人员认为既然要“派”，就不能讲“自愿”，这是不对的。许多地区的实际经验证明了这个道理：实行生猪派养派购，是能做到既符合国家利益，又符合农民的个人利益的。湖北宜都县就是一个好例子。这个县曾经在136个乡里，充分进行了生猪派养派购的宣传动员，把政策宣传到户，最近许多乡的农民都自愿地积极地卖猪。这个事实说明：只要农民懂得了党的政策，就会自觉地接受生猪派养派购任务。
    单单宣传政策也还不够。农民出卖生猪可能有很多不同的思想顾虑，应当分别对他们进行具体工作。如果农民顾虑卖了猪没有肉吃，那就应当说清楚留肉留油的优待办法。如果农民顾虑卖了大猪，买不上小猪，那就应当切实组织仔猪的供应。至于有些地区因私商深入农户，从事黑市抬价活动，而引起少数农民不愿按照牌价卖给国家的时候，也应该一方面向农民揭露私商的活动；另一方面加强对私营屠宰商的管理和社会主义改造，以限制和消灭黑市投机的违法活动。
