How the American Authorities Released Liu Yongming
    Chen Long

    On January 7th, the iron gates of a mental hospital in Missouri, in the American Midwest, opened, releasing a 36-year-old Chinese student. Since May 1949, when the American government locked him behind these gates, this was the first and last time in five years that he would leave this American mental hospital, which was essentially a detention center for Chinese students. Not long ago, the US Immigration Bureau had said that he was "unfit to travel," but on this day, they suddenly declared that he was completely recovered and could return home alone without an escort.

    On the evening of January 6th, Gui Qionghua, an amateur school teacher in Nanjing's Dingjiaqiao, had just settled her eight-year-old daughter, Meimei, to sleep when she was suddenly notified that there was a long-distance phone call for her. She rushed to the place where she could answer the phone, and as soon as she heard the first sentence, she exclaimed, "I'm so happy! I can't even express how happy I am!" A few hot tears rolled onto her clothes. She said, "Thank you to the government, thank you to the Red Cross. Yongming will be able to return so soon." Finally, she said, "We must continue to oppose the US government's detention of Chinese students, so that thousands of Chinese students can return and reunite with their families."

    On the other end of the phone was a reporter from Xinhua News Agency in Beijing. He told Gui Qionghua that the Chinese side had specifically requested her husband, Liu Yongming, from the United States. The American authorities panicked. On January 5th, the US Immigration Bureau announced the release of Liu Yongming, allowing him to board a ship back to China on January 8th. He told Gui Qionghua that after the government received her letter, Ambassador Wang Bingnan wrote to US Ambassador Johnson, demanding information about Liu Yongming's whereabouts. At the same time, they requested assistance from India based on the Sino-American talks agreement. The Chinese Red Cross also sent a telegram to the American Red Cross requesting assistance.

    After receiving these letters and telegrams, the American authorities knew that the scheme to detain Liu Yongming had been exposed. Officials from the US Immigration Bureau, known as the "Palace of Hell" by Chinese students, were thrown into panic. They quickly released Liu Yongming while plotting how to cover up their misdeeds.

    They said that they had been preparing to deport Liu Yongming since 1951, but the United Kingdom was unwilling to let him pass through Hong Kong. It wouldn't matter if the people from the American "Palace of Hell" said so, but the British authorities in Hong Kong denied it. They said that the United States had not requested permission for Liu Yongming to disembark in Hong Kong. The American "Palace of Hell" officials were extremely embarrassed. They had to change their story, saying that since 1951, the hospital had considered Liu Yongming's illness to be "unfit for travel." As a result, Dr. Hockert, the director of the Missouri mental hospital, was also left bewildered.

    What Hockert was worried about indeed happened. In her Nanjing residence, Gui Qionghua opened a drawer and took out several letters from Hockert and Liu Yongming, asking the Xinhua News Agency to broadcast them abroad.

    In a letter to Liu Yongming's family in December 1950, Hockert said, "Liu Yongming's illness has completely recovered. I don't think it is necessary to delay any longer. We can arrange for him to return now."

    Hockert wrote another letter on January 2, 1951, saying that he had contacted the University of Missouri to send Liu Yongming back. "I will notify you immediately as soon as there is any progress."

    However, what surprised Liu Yongming's family was that Hockert never wrote again after that. Five months later, Liu Yongming sent back a letter saying, "I don't know when I will be able to escape this sea of suffering," and advised his sixth younger brother, "If your finances allow, you should still prepare to study abroad, but don't come to America." A few days later, Liu Yongming wrote again, saying, "I have tried to send out several letters to you this month... I am not free to move here... I am not free to write letters." After that, even Liu Yongming's letters stopped arriving.

    Thus, the question of Liu Yongming's return to China and information about Liu Yongming disappeared like a stone sinking into the sea, for one year, two years, three years, four years. It has been four months since China and the United States reached an agreement on the return of civilians, and it has been at least four months since the United States shouted that any overseas Chinese in the United States are free to return to China, but there is still no information about Liu Yongming. It was not until China specifically requested the person that the iron curtain covering Liu Yongming was lifted.

    The letters from the American doctor and Liu Yongming are irrefutable evidence of the American detention of students studying in the United States. Liu Yongming has been released, but why did the American authorities imprison a Chinese who wanted to return home in a mental hospital for four years? Why didn't they give his family any information for four years? Why did they detain him even after the Geneva Agreement? These are all questions that the Chinese people demand a full answer to from the United States. The Chinese people demand that the US government fully implement the Geneva Agreement, abolish all measures to persecute and threaten Chinese students, and immediately release all Chinese like Liu Yongming who are detained or prevented from returning to China in the United States.

　　美国当局是怎样才释放刘永铭的
    陈龙
    1月7日美国中部密苏里州一个神经病院的铁门打开了，放出来一位36岁的中国留美学生。自从1949年5月美国政府把他关进这扇铁门以后，五年来这是第一次、也是最后一次他永远地离开了那个实质上是中国学生拘留所的美国神经病院。不久以前美国移民局还说他“不适于旅行”，但是这一天，他们突然说他完全好了，可以不要人护送单独回国。
    1月6日的晚上，南京丁家桥一位业余学校女教师桂琼华刚安顿好她的八岁的女孩美美睡觉，突然得到通知有长途电话找她。她急急忙忙赶到接电话的地方，拿起话筒，刚刚听到第一句话，便失声叫了起来：“太高兴啦！简直高兴得说不出来！”几滴热泪滚到她的衣襟上，她说：“感谢政府，感谢红十字会，永铭这样快就可以回来了。”最后她说：“我们要继续反对美国政府扣留中国留学生，使几千中国留学生都能够回来和家人团聚。”
    电话的这一端是北京新华社的记者。他告诉桂琼华，中国方面向美国指名要她的丈夫刘永铭。美国当局慌了，1月5日美国移民局宣布释放刘永铭，让他在1月8号坐船回国。他告诉桂琼华，政府接到了她的来信之后，一方面就由王炳南大使写信给美国约翰逊大使，要求交代刘永铭的下落。另一方面又请求印度方面根据中美会谈的协议进行协助。中国红十字会也打了电报请美国红十字会协助。
    美国当局接到了这些信件和电报之后，知道扣留刘永铭的勾当已经闹穿了。被中国留学生称为“阎王殿”的美国移民局的官员们，惊惶失措起来了。他们一面赶快释放刘永铭，一面计议怎样掩盖劣迹。
    他们说，从1951年起就准备把刘永铭驱逐出境，可是英国不愿让他经过香港。美国“阎王殿”的人们这样说说倒不要紧，但香港英国当局却否认有这回事。它说美国并没有要求许可刘永铭在香港登岸。美国“阎王殿”的老爷们弄得尴尬得很。他们只得改口说，自从1951年以来医院方面认为刘永铭病还没有好，“不适于旅行”。因此，密苏里神经病院院长霍克脱医生也被弄得啼笑皆非。
    霍克脱所耽心的事情果然发生了。在南京寓所里桂琼华翻开抽屉，捡出了几封霍克脱和刘永铭的信，拿给新华社记者，要求新华社向国外广播。
    霍克脱1950年12月给刘永铭家人的信上说：“刘永铭的病已经完全好了，我认为没有必要再拖延，现在就可以安排他回去。”
    霍克脱1951年1月2日又写了一封信说，已经向密苏里大学接洽送刘永铭回去，“事情一有头绪，我会马上通知你们。”
    然而，使刘永铭的家人觉得非常奇怪的是，霍克脱从此竟不来信了。五个月以后刘永铭寄回来一封信，说：“不知何日方能超脱苦海”，又劝他的六弟说：“如经济允许，还应有留学深造的准备，但不必到美国来。”几天以后刘永铭又来信说：“本月份我写了几封信给你都是设法寄出，……我在此行动不自由……写信没有自由。”这以后连刘永铭的信也收不到了。
    就这样，关于刘永铭回国的问题，和关于刘永铭的情况，像石沉大海一样，一年、两年、三年、四年。中美关于双方平民回国问题达成了协议已经四个月，美国叫喊说任何在美华侨都可以自由回国，也已经起码是四个月，可是关于刘永铭仍然连一点信息都没有。直到中国方面指名要人，遮没了刘永铭的铁幕才被揭开。
    美国医生和刘永铭的信是美国扣留留美学生的推翻不了的铁证。刘永铭是被释放了，但是，美国当局为什么把要求回国的中国人关在神经病院里达四年之久，为什么四年来不给他的家人任何信息，为什么日内瓦协议之后还扣留他？这些都是中国人民要求美国充分答复的问题。中国人民要求美国政府充分履行日内瓦协议、取消一切迫害和威胁中国留学生的措施，立即释放所有类似刘永铭一样被扣或被阻在美国不能回国的中国人。
