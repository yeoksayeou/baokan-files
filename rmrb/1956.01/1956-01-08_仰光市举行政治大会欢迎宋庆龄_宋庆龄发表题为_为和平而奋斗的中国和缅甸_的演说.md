Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, January 7th. The Burma Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League held a political rally in Rangoon City Hall on the morning of January 6th to welcome Soong Ching Ling, the Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. More than two thousand people attended the meeting. Soong Ching Ling, accompanied by Yao Zhongming, the Chinese Ambassador to Burma, arrived at the venue. As she stepped onto the stage, which was decorated with huge Chinese and Burmese flags, she was greeted with warm applause from the participants. U Nu, Chairman of the Burma Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League and Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, spoke at the meeting, introducing Soong Ching Ling. U Nu first introduced the outstanding work and achievements of Soong Ching Ling's husband, the great Chinese democratic revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, and expressed his respect for Mr. Sun Yat-sen. U Nu said that Soong Ching Ling, like her outstanding husband, is a great patriot and a person who works tirelessly for the progress of her country and the prosperity of the Chinese people. She has played a significant role in the many changes in that great country. U Nu also described Soong Ching Ling's contributions to the great revolution of the Chinese people and to the international movement against imperialism and in defense of peace. U Nu's introduction was repeatedly interrupted by applause.

Soong Ching Ling then delivered a speech at the meeting entitled "China and Burma Fighting for Peace."

Soong Ching Ling first reviewed the long-standing friendly relations between the Chinese and Burmese peoples. She then pointed out that now both of our countries have won the right to govern our own lands according to our own ways. We are once again determining our own course in international affairs. We are reaffirming our traditional friendship. The Chinese people are grateful to the Burmese people and government for their consistent support on the Taiwan issue and on the restoration of China's legitimate status and rights in the United Nations. The Chinese people have always been willing to provide all possible assistance, based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, to the Burmese people in the process of building their own country.

Soong Ching Ling said that China and Burma are good neighbors. Our relationship is built on the desire of our two peoples for security and progress. The model of Sino-Burmese relations is part of the entire structure woven from various Asian relationships. Historical and current facts fully confirm that the Asian people are extremely close. This close relationship, in most cases, proves to be stronger than external forces. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence announced by the Prime Ministers of China, India, and Burma in June 1954 are clearly a direct result of Asian history, expressed in accordance with the circumstances of the 20th century. It is a logical development that three major Asian countries, which have long suffered from foreign aggression and oppression, first proposed these principles as a guide to relations between countries. It is also natural that these principles have received widespread praise elsewhere in the region. This shows that there is a broad consensus among the modern Asian people.

Soong Ching Ling said, of course, there are also some people who do not like the Five Principles and the spirit of the Five Principles; they do not want to see the people of all countries move forward along the path of friendship and cooperation. What they are happy to see is, for example, China and Burma being suspicious of each other. In their view, nothing has changed in Asia and the world, and they can continue to divide these regions and alienate the people of all countries for their own purposes, as in the past. They cannot recognize that if our past has taught us anything, then undoubtedly it is that the destinies of our two countries and peoples are closely linked.

Soong Ching Ling said that the awakened people of Asia have found a way to seek common ground while reserving differences. In Asia, there are large countries and small countries; in Asia, there are various different political and economic forms; in Asia, there are many different customs and habits. However, under our unanimously agreed arrangement, large countries do not impose their will on small countries; we all act according to the belief that the people of every country have the sacred and inviolable right to decide how to handle their own internal affairs.

Soong Ching Ling pointed out the significance of the Asian-African Conference and the Four-Power Summit in demonstrating that agreements can be reached between countries. She went on to say that one must also consider the talks between the Chinese and American ambassadors in Geneva immediately afterwards. This meeting is of great significance, not only because it discussed important issues, but also because it shows that these two important countries have taken a major step forward in direct negotiations. The agreements that have been reached foreshadow that China and the United States must continue to work hard to reach further agreements and promote the normalization of relations between these two major countries. Because this is the key to truly easing tensions in the Far East and solving many outstanding issues.

Soong Ching Ling said that no one should think that a country's desire for peace and peaceful settlement is a sign of weakness or an abandonment of principles. No one should think that reciprocal negotiations can reach an agreement in a situation that only benefits one side. In all these matters, there is only one criterion that can be used as the basis for the actions of all countries and can be used to measure the governments of all countries, that is, what are the legitimate rights of the people and countries concerned. Difficulties arise when actions are not based on this criterion. It must be pointed out that in our region, complete disregard for our legitimate rights by aggressor nations has become a tradition. It must also be pointed out that the continuation of this attitude is the root cause of the current tensions in the Far East.

Usurping China's seat in the United Nations, refusing to negotiate the peaceful reunification of Korea, refusing to support the Geneva Accords on restoring peace in Indochina with actions, constantly instigating the hateful Chiang Kai-shek clique to threaten the security of China, Burma, and the entire Asia, and the further economic, political, and military development of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization threatening the interests of every country in Asia are all products of the aforementioned attitude, which is incompatible with the times.

Soong Ching Ling said that as far as the Chinese people are concerned, we want peace. We believe that the people of Burma and other countries in Asia have the same ideas about how to achieve a normal environment in Asia. More and more Asian countries and people realize that, first, it is necessary to convene an international conference to discuss issues related to the Far East, in which there must be broad participation of countries in this region; second, there needs to be a collective peace pact in the entire Asia and Pacific region, including the United States of course. The purpose of such a historic agreement is to replace the military agreements currently existing in Asia and provide a foundation for a long period of peace, during which trade and cultural exchanges will grow. China will, as in the past, support any valuable and necessary steps for maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

Soong Ching Ling concluded by saying that China and Burma are devoting a considerable portion of their thought and energy to expanding the area of peace. We have resolutely taken on these responsibilities. Let us, together with all peace-loving countries and peoples, further advance the cause of peace and progress in Asia and the world.

Soong Ching Ling's speech repeatedly received enthusiastic applause and cheers from the participants. When she finally finished speaking, the people attending the meeting stood up and cheered and applauded for as long as three minutes. Slogans such as "Long Live Sino-Burmese Friendship!" resounded continuously throughout the venue.

    仰光市举行政治大会欢迎宋庆龄
　　宋庆龄发表题为“为和平而奋斗的中国和缅甸”的演说
    新华社仰光7日电　缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟6日上午在仰光市政厅举行政治大会，欢迎中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄。参加大会的有两千多人。宋庆龄在中国驻缅甸大使姚仲明陪同下到达会场。当她走上悬挂着巨幅的中缅两国国旗的主席台时，受到了参加大会的人热烈的鼓掌欢迎。缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席、缅甸联邦总理吴努在会上讲话，为宋庆龄作介绍。吴努首先介绍了宋庆龄的丈夫、中国伟大的民主主义革命家孙中山先生的卓越工作和成就，并且向孙中山先生表示敬意。吴努说，宋庆龄同她的卓越的丈夫一样，是一位伟大的爱国者，一位为她的祖国的进步和中国人民的繁荣而不倦工作的人。在那个伟大的国家的许多变动中，她都发挥了重大的作用。吴努还叙述了宋庆龄在中国人民的伟大革命中以及在国际反对帝国主义和保卫和平的运动中所作的贡献。吴努的介绍一再为掌声所打断。
    宋庆龄接着在会上发表了题目为“为和平而奋斗的中国和缅甸”的演说。
    宋庆龄首先回顾了中缅两国人民历史悠久的友好关系。她接着指出，现在我们两国都已经赢得了根据自己的方式来统治我们国土的权利。我们又重新在国际事务中决定自己的路线。我们又重新强调我们传统的友谊。中国人民感谢缅甸人民和政府在台湾问题和恢复中国在联合国的合法地位和权利的问题上所给予中国的一贯支持。中国人民对于缅甸人民在建设自己国家的过程中所遭遇的困难，也一向愿意根据平等互利的原则给予一切可能的协助。
    宋庆龄说，中国和缅甸是很好的邻邦。我们的关系是建立在我们两国人民对于安全和进步的愿望上面的。中缅关系的式样是亚洲各种关系编织起来的整个结构的一部分。历史性的和当前的事实充分证实了，亚洲人民是极其亲近的。这种亲近的关系在大部分情况下，证明比外来的势力更为坚强。中国、印度和缅甸的总理们在1954年6月宣布的和平共处的五项原则，显然是亚洲历史的直接结果，而按照20世纪的情况表达出来。三个长期遭受外来侵略和压迫的主要亚洲国家，首先提出这些原则作为国与国之间关系的指导，是很合乎逻辑的发展。这些原则在这个地区的其他地方获得广泛的赞许也是很自然的。这说明了在现代的亚洲人民中间存在着广大的一致的方面。
    宋庆龄说，当然，也有一些人不喜欢五项原则和五项原则的精神，他们不愿意看到各国人民沿着友好和合作的道路前进。他们所高兴看到的是，例如中国和缅甸互相猜忌。在他们看来，在亚洲和世界上并没有什么变化，他们可以像过去一样，为了自己的目的继续分裂这些地区和离间各国人民。他们不能认识到，如果我们的过去曾经给我们什么教训的话，那么毫无疑问地就是，我们两个国家和两国人民的命运是密切联系起来的。
    宋庆龄说，亚洲觉醒了的人们已经找到一条求同存异的道路。在亚洲有大国，也有小国；在亚洲有各种不同的政治和经济形式；在亚洲有许多不同的风俗习惯。然而，在我们一致同意的安排下，大的国家不把它的意志强加于小国；我们都根据一个信念行事，那就是，每一个国家的人民都有神圣不可侵犯的权利来决定如何处理自己的内政。
    宋庆龄指出了亚非会议和四国政府首脑会议在证明国与国之间可能达成协议方面的意义。她接着说，人们也必须要想到紧接着在日内瓦举行的中美大使之间的会谈。这一会谈具有重大意义，不仅因为它讨论了重要的问题，而且因为它表明了这两个重要国家在直接谈判方面前进了一大步。已经取得了的协议预兆着中美两国必须继续努力，以达到进一步的协议，并且促进这两个大国之间关系的正常化。因为这正是真正和缓远东紧张局势和解决许多悬而未决的问题的关键。
    宋庆龄说，任何人都不应该认为，一个国家对于和平和和平解决的愿望是示弱或者是放弃原则的表现。任何人也不应该认为，在只对一方有利的情况下，对等的谈判能够达成协议。在所有这些事情上，只有一个准则可以作为各国行动的根据并且可以用来衡量各国政府，那就是，各有关人民和国家的合法权利是什么。当行动不是以这个准则为依据的时候，困难就出现了。必须指出，在我们这个地区，侵略国家完全漠视我们的合法权利已经成为传统。还要指出，这种态度的继续就是目前远东紧张局势的根源。
    在联合国中篡夺中国的地位，拒绝协商朝鲜的和平统一，拒绝以行动来支持关于恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议，不断唆使可恨的蒋介石集团威胁中国、缅甸和整个亚洲的安全，东南亚公约集团威胁亚洲每一个国家的利益的进一步的经济、政治和军事发展，所有这些都是上述那种态度的产物，而这种态度是同时代不相符合的。
    宋庆龄说，就中国人民来说，我们是要和平的。我们相信，缅甸和亚洲其他国家的人民对于如何在亚洲获得正常的环境，是有同样的想法的。越来越多的亚洲国家和人民认识到，第一有必要召开一个讨论有关远东问题的国际会议，在这个会议上必须要有这个地区的国家的广泛参加；第二在整个亚洲和太平洋地区，当然也包括美国在内，须要一个集体和平公约，这样一个历史性的协议的目的是要代替目前存在于亚洲的军事协定，并且为一个长时期的和平提供基础，在这个和平时期中贸易和文化的交流将会日益发展。中国将会像过去一样支持任何对维护亚洲和世界和平有价值的和必要的步骤。
    宋庆龄最后说，中国和缅甸把相当大的一部分思考和精力用于扩大和平地区。我们已经坚决地肩负起这些责任。让我们同所有爱好和平的国家和人民一起，把亚洲和世界的和平和进步事业更加向前推进。
    宋庆龄的演说一再得到与会者的热烈鼓掌和欢呼。当她最后讲完的时候，参加大会的人起立欢呼和鼓掌达三分钟之久。会场内不断响起了“缅中友好万岁！”等口号。
