We Must Build Handicraft Cooperatives Quickly and Well
Bai Rubing, Director of the Central Handicraft Administration

Recently, the enthusiasm of handicraft laborers throughout the country for taking the socialist road has reached an unprecedented high. Major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have fully realized handicraft cooperation. Old cooperatives in other areas are also constantly expanding, and new cooperatives are being organized in batches. A nationwide upsurge of handicraft cooperation has arrived.

By the end of last year, 2 million handicraft laborers nationwide had organized more than 70,000 handicraft cooperatives, supply and marketing production cooperatives, and production groups. The members of these cooperatives (groups) accounted for about 25% of the total number of individual handicraft practitioners, with an annual total output value of 2 billion yuan, accounting for about 27% of the total output value of individual handicrafts. Currently, there are more than 20,000 cooperatives with a fully socialist nature, with members accounting for 40% of the organized population and output value accounting for 63%. Some of these cooperatives have already achieved mechanized and semi-mechanized production. After rectification last year, the cooperative organizations generally demonstrated the superiority of being organized in increasing production, improving quality, reducing costs, improving the lives of members, and increasing public accumulation, becoming a huge force and model for attracting the vast number of handicraft laborers to take the socialist road. At the same time, the handicraft cooperation work over the past few years has also cultivated cadres and accumulated experience in running cooperatives, laying a solid foundation for the accelerated development of handicraft cooperation.

The experience of Beijing in fully realizing handicraft cooperation proves that as long as we believe in the Party, believe in the masses, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, break down the work methods of sticking to conventions, strengthen overall planning, take active measures, and vigorously promote advanced experience, and closely integrate the work of building cooperatives with production work, we can accelerate the development of handicraft cooperation and complete the historical task of socialist transformation of handicrafts ahead of schedule.

In order to accelerate the development of handicraft cooperation, and to ensure that organization work, production arrangement work, etc., keep up in time, and achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, the following issues must be noted:

First, we must adapt to the requirements of large-scale development and make overall plans for the transformation of handicrafts in the entire province (city), entire special district (city), entire county (city), entire district (centered on market towns), and entire township. The methods of establishing cooperatives in cities can generally adopt the method of organizing all industries throughout the city as in Beijing, mainly by expanding old cooperatives and combining with the establishment of new cooperatives; however, in areas where conditions are not yet very mature, the method of developing in stages and batches by industry can still be adopted. In rural areas, it is generally possible to take market towns as the center, and adopt methods of dividing into areas by county or taking districts as units, according to the concentration and dispersion of handicraft production, or establishing cooperatives by industry, or establishing comprehensive cooperatives with similar industries (in villages where handicrafts are concentrated, cooperatives can also be established locally). The expansion and establishment of cooperatives must be carried out in a planned and organized manner. Whether in urban or rural areas, leadership and the masses should be combined according to the actual situation, and discussions should be held among key members and activists to formulate specific plans for control. Handicrafts below the county level should face the countryside and serve agricultural production. Currently, the iron, wood, and building repair industries should be organized quickly to vigorously carry out the manufacture and repair of new and old agricultural tools. Counties should establish large-scale production cooperatives for the manufacture and repair of agricultural tools, and districts should establish handicraft cooperatives based on market towns, and organize fixed repair stations and mobile repair groups in townships according to the specific conditions of the countryside. Large-scale production cooperatives in counties have the responsibility to provide technical guidance and assistance to cooperatives and stations in districts and townships.

Second, we must vigorously conduct socialist future education and cooperative constitution education for individual handicraft workers, and convene representative conferences of handicraft laborers universally. Before organizing cooperatives, under the unified leadership of the Party and government, an appropriate number of leading cadres should be drawn from relevant departments, and a large number of activists should be selected from old cooperatives, labor associations, processing and ordering groups, and other organizations. After three to five days of short-term training, the Party's policies and methods of building cooperatives should be explained, and the team for establishing cooperatives should be organized as soon as possible. It must be clear in the leading ideology: we should try our best to support and meet the enthusiasm and urgent demands of the masses to take the socialist road. In general, areas with conditions can adopt the method of centralized mobilization through conferences, industry-by-industry discussions, individual applications, and batch or one-time approval. However, the establishment of cooperatives must adhere to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and must not be forced; it must adapt to objective conditions and must not transcend objective conditions. For those who do not want to join the cooperative for the time being, education should continue to be strengthened, and appropriate arrangements should be made for them in production. We must patiently wait for their awakening and should not force them to be absorbed. In terms of organizational form, wherever it is possible to organize advanced production cooperatives, advanced production cooperatives should be organized directly. If conditions are not yet sufficient to organize advanced production cooperatives, lower-level production cooperatives (groups) should be organized, but conditions should be actively created to strive for an early transition to advanced cooperatives. It is wrong to be able to transition but not transition for a long time. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient cadres in large-scale development and to facilitate the proper arrangement of production as soon as possible, in areas with a good foundation for cooperation, old cooperatives should be appropriately expanded to give play to the role of large cooperatives leading small cooperatives, old cooperatives leading new cooperatives, and advanced cooperatives driving backward cooperatives. In the process of expanding and building cooperatives, on the one hand, we must fully and boldly use key members and activists to form the core; on the other hand, we must strengthen ideological leadership, strengthen unity and mutual assistance between new and old members, especially between new and old cadres, and criticize and overcome various narrow and guild-like ideological sentiments. In areas where institutions have not yet been established or are not yet sound, they should be established or improved quickly. Large and medium-sized cities and areas with concentrated handicrafts should establish specialized joint cooperatives by industry or establish specialized joint cooperatives with comprehensive nature according to the needs and possibilities. For various craftsmen who are scattered, sporadic, and mobile in repairing old items, they should be organized and education should be strengthened, but their original good tradition of serving residents in a decentralized manner should not be changed casually. For the inherent excellent handicrafts of our country, they must be preserved, developed and improved. Special attention should be paid to giving full play to the wisdom and expertise of old artists, encouraging them to pass on technology and create new works of art, and providing necessary care in their lives.

Third, we must earnestly do a good job in supply, production, and sales. Timely arrangement of production and overcoming supply and sales difficulties are the key to whether cooperatives can be consolidated and improved after being organized. In the process of establishing cooperatives, in order to avoid both transformation and production being affected, the original supply and sales relationships should not be interrupted, the original product varieties should not be reduced, the original selling prices should be temporarily maintained, and the original stores and service points should be retained, and then adjustments should be made with leadership and in a planned way. After the cooperative is established, it should be put into production quickly and should not remain in the planning stage. The change of production relations should be carried out in conjunction with production. While establishing necessary production management systems and starting production, an evaluation committee should be organized to handle issues such as shares, wages, and tool depreciation in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. For the issue of centralized production and decentralized production, it must be arranged properly according to different industries and different regions. What should be centralized should be centralized, and what should be decentralized should be decentralized. If centralized production is not possible for the time being, production can also be carried out in groups by zones or in workshops with different processes. Do not force centralization too early. Especially for those who sharpen scissors, mend pots and nail bowls, and repair boots and shoes, in addition to setting up appropriate points in busy cities or residential areas, they generally should not be blindly centralized, and appropriate organizational methods should be adopted to better play their characteristics of going from street to street and providing production services door-to-door. The various plans of handicraft production cooperatives, especially the supply, production, and sales plans, should be established gradually from rough to fine, and should be incorporated into local and national industrial plans as soon as possible. Handicraft production cooperatives should always pay attention to the production and living needs of urban and rural people, make full use of local raw materials and various waste products and substitutes, develop production, practice strict economy, increase product varieties, improve product quality, reduce product costs, and produce more and better new products that meet the diverse needs of the people; and through the accumulation of their own funds, start with improving tools and modifying equipment, and gradually carry out the technical transformation of handicrafts.

The socialist transformation of handicrafts is a great change. Handicraft management departments and production federations at all levels must rely on the leadership of the Party committees and governments, give full play to the enthusiasm of all handicraft workers and handicraft laborers, and take all effective measures to build handicraft cooperatives quickly and well.

    必须把手工业合作社建设得又快又好
    中央手工业管理局局长　白如冰
    近来，全国各地手工业劳动者要求走社会主义道路的积极性空前高涨。北京、上海等大城市已全部实现了手工业合作化。其他各地的老社也正在不断地扩大，新社正在成批组织起来。全国范围内手工业合作化的高潮已经到来了。
    到去年年底，全国已经有200万手工业劳动者组织了7万多个手工业合作社、供销生产社和生产小组，社（组）员约占个体手工业从业人数的25％，全年生产总值20亿元，约占个体手工业总产值的27％。现在完全社会主义性质的合作社已经有2万多个，社员占组织起来人数的40％，产值占63％。其中一部分合作社，已经实现了机械化、半机械化生产。经过去年整顿以后的合作组织，一般都在增加生产、提高质量、降低成本、改善社员生活、增加公共积累等方面，显示出组织起来的优越性，成为吸引广大手工业劳动者走社会主义道路的巨大力量和榜样。同时，在几年来手工业合作化工作中，还培养了干部，积累了办社经验，为手工业合作化的加快发展打下了可靠的基础。
    北京市全部实现手工业合作化的经验证明：只要相信党、相信群众，克服右倾保守思想，打破墨守成规的工作方法，加强全面规划，采取积极措施，大力推广先进经验，把建社工作和生产工作密切结合起来，就能够加快手工业合作化的发展速度，提前完成手工业社会主义改造的历史任务。
    为了加快手工业合作化的发展，并且使组织工作、生产安排工作等及时赶上去，做到又多、又快、又好、又省，就必须注意以下问题：
    第一、必须适应大发展要求，做好全省（市）、全专区（市）、全县（市）、全区（以集镇为中心）和全乡的手工业改造的全面规划。建社的方法，城市一般可采用北京市全市按行业全部组织起来，以扩大老社为主，结合建立新社的办法；但是在条件还不很成熟的地区，仍可采取按行业分期、分批发展的办法。农村一般可以集镇为中心，采用由县分片或以区为单位，按照手工业生产集中和分散的情况，或者按行业建社，或者按性质相近的行业建立带综合性的合作社，（在手工业集中的乡村，也可以就地建社）。扩社建社，必须有计划、有组织地进行。不论是城市或农村，都应根据实际情况，领导和群众相结合，在骨干和积极分子中进行讨论，订出具体规划，加以掌握。县以下手工业要面向农村，为农业生产服务。当前应当很快把铁业、木业和建筑修缮业组织起来，大力进行新旧农具的制造和修配业务。县要建立农具制造、修配的大型生产合作社，区要以集镇为基点建立手工业合作社，并且按农村具体情况，组织固定修配站和乡的流动修配小组。县的大型生产合作社有责任对区、乡的社、站在技术上进行指导和帮助。
    第二、必须大张旗鼓地对个体手工业者进行社会主义前途教育和合作社社章教育，普遍召开手工业劳动者代表会议。在组织合作社以前，要在党政统一领导下，从有关方面抽调适当数量的领导骨干，再从老社、劳动者协会、加工订货小组等组织中，大量选拔积极分子，经过三、五天的短期训练，交代党的政策和建社方法，尽快地组织建社队伍。在领导思想上必须明确：应该尽量支持和满足群众走社会主义道路的积极性和迫切要求，凡有条件的地区，一般均可通过大会集中动员、按行业讨论、个别申请、分批或一次批准的办法。但是，建社必须坚持自愿、互利原则，不能强制；必须适应客观情况，不能超越客观情况。对于那些暂时还不想加入合作社的，要继续加强教育，并且在生产上给以适当安排，要耐心地等待他们的觉悟，不要勉强把他们吸收进来。在组织形式上，凡能组织高级生产合作社的，就应该直接组织高级生产合作社。目前条件还不够组织高级生产社的，就应当组织低级的生产社（组），但是要积极创造条件，争取尽早过渡到高级社。能过渡而长期不过渡是错误的。为了解决大发展中干部不足的困难和便于早日妥善安排生产，在合作化基础较好的地区，应适当扩大老社，以发挥大带小、老带新和先进带动落后的作用。在扩社建社过程中，一方面既要充分、大胆地运用骨干和积极分子，组成核心；另一方面必须加强思想领导，加强新老社员、特别是新老干部之间的团结互助，批判和克服各种狭隘的、行会主义的思想情绪。凡机构还未建立或机构还不健全的地区，应该迅速建立或健全起来。大中城市和手工业集中地区，应根据需要和可能，按行业建立专业联社，或按性质相近的行业建立带综合性的专业联社。对于分散零星、流动修旧的各种手艺人，应当把他们组织起来，加强教育，但不要随便改变他们原来分散为居民服务的良好传统。对于我国固有的优良的手工艺品，必须保存、发展和提高，特别应该注意充分发挥老艺人的智慧和特长，鼓励他们传授技术，创制新的艺术品，并在生活上给予必要的照顾。
    第三、必须切实做好供产销工作。及时安排生产，克服供销困难，这是组织起来以后合作社能否巩固提高的关键。在建社过程中，为使改造、生产两不误，对原有的供销关系不要打断，对原有的产品品种不能减少，对原有的出售价格暂时维持不动，对原有的门市部和服务点应予保留，然后再有领导、有计划地进行调整。合作社建立起来以后，应该迅速投入生产，不要停留在规划阶段。生产关系的改变要同生产结合起来进行，一面建立必要的生产管理制度，开始生产；一面组织评议委员会，根据自愿互利原则，处理股金、工资及工具折价等问题。对于集中生产和分散生产的问题，务要按照各种不同行业、不同地区，妥善地安排。应该集中的就集中，应该分散的就分散，暂时不能集中生产的，也可以分片划分小组或分不同工序的车间进行生产，不要过早地勉强集中。特别是对那些磨剪刀的、补锅钉碗的、修理靴鞋的，除了在闹市或聚居区适当设点外，一般均不能盲目集中，应该采取适当的组织方法，更好地发挥其串街游乡、生产上门的特点。手工业生产合作社的各种计划，特别是供产销计划，应该由粗到细，逐步建立起来，要求尽快地纳入地方的和国家的工业计划之内。手工业生产合作社应该经常注意城乡人民生产、生活的需要，充分利用地方原料和各种废品、代用品，发展生产，厉行节约，增加产品品种，提高产品质量，降低产品成本，生产更多、更好符合人民多样需要的新产品；并通过自有资金的积累，从改进工具、改装设备入手，逐步进行对手工业的技术改造。
    手工业社会主义改造是一项伟大的变革，各级手工业管理部门和生产联社，必须依靠党委和政府的领导，充分发挥全体手工业工作者和手工业劳动者的积极性，采取一切有效措施，把手工业合作社建设得又快又好。
