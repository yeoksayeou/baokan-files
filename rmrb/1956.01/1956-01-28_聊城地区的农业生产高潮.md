    The Liaocheng area of Shandong Province, after basically achieving semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization, Party committees at all levels immediately formulated production plans for each level and for agricultural production cooperatives, which powerfully promoted the arrival of a new production upsurge in the entire area.
    The production plans in Liaocheng area are very practical and also very ambitious. The entire special district has 13 million mu of cultivated land. Among them, 10 million mu of plains used to experience free loss of water and soil, with droughts nine years out of ten, and droughts followed by floods; 3 million mu of low-lying land has historically suffered from spring droughts and autumn floods, followed by droughts again after autumn. Therefore, yields have been very low. In the era of the individual economy, farmers were powerless to change this situation. Now, with cooperatives, they are fully confident in turning all 10 million mu of plains into large terraced fields within this year—that is, building ridges of about one foot high in the fields to intercept rainwater, and in turning all 3 million mu of low-lying land into good land before this spring by building ditches, embankments, and terraces. Of the 13 million mu of cultivated land in the entire special district, 3.3 million mu are saline-alkali land; in the old society, saline-alkali land could not produce grain every year, and farmers still had to pay grain taxes, causing some farmers to be ruined and lose their families. Now, they have decided to convert 1 million mu of saline-alkali land into fertile fields within one year, and complete the entire transformation within three years. In the past, farmers were unable to plant crops according to local conditions due to their weak strength, and mostly planted low-yield crops. Now, they have decided to increase high-yield crops from 1 million mu to 5 million mu within one year. The entire special district originally had only 320,000 mu of irrigated land. This year, it is planned to mobilize cooperatives to drill 50,000 new wells and 50,000 spring outlets, and increase 60,000 waterwheels; in addition to using river water and pit water, etc., this year 1.5 million to 2 million mu of dry land can be turned into irrigated land. In the past, this area had few pigs and little manure accumulation. This year, the number of pigs can be increased from 160,000 to 900,000. Coupled with other manure accumulation activities, the entire special district's crude fertilizer can be increased by more than double compared to last year. In the past, crop losses averaged more than 10% each year due to insect pests; this year, in addition to stepping up prevention work and making full use of existing equipment, another 20,000 dusters and 30,000 sprayers will be purchased to ensure that pests are eliminated in the initial stages and do not become disasters. In the past, cultivation was extensive, and it was extremely difficult to promote new technologies; this year, all effective and mature experiences that have been tested can be incorporated into the production plans of the cooperatives to ensure implementation according to specifications. They firmly believe that as long as these measures are implemented, the grain production of the entire special district can leap from the old rule of increasing by 1.7% each year since 1950 to increasing by more than 50%, and cotton can increase by more than 40%.
    The process of formulating production plans in the Liaocheng area was not smooth sailing. They encountered resistance from various forms of right-leaning conservative thinking from some staff members. This right-leaning conservative thinking mainly stems from the inability to consciously start from the new situation of the cooperative economy, and adhering to outdated views that all start from the small-peasant economy; lacking a conscious spirit of revolutionary advancement in the socialist revolution, and even lacking a sense of political responsibility. Things that could be done in one or two years are forcibly dragged on for three or five years.
    In order to overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking of cadres, the Liaocheng District Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, while helping cadres at all levels to ideologically recognize that the economic foundation in the current countryside has undergone a fundamental change, emphasized approaching the masses and conducting in-depth investigations and research. The production increase target they set in August last year was 8%, and in October it was revised to strive for an increase of 12%. Later, the District Committee personally went to the countryside and investigated more than 20 agricultural cooperatives, only to realize the seriousness of the previous right-leaning conservative thinking, and planned to change the production increase target to 40%. Later, the District Committee and various departments went to the countryside again and investigated the production increase situation of more than 60 agricultural cooperatives, and also conducted on-site observation of the winter production activities of various cooperatives. After much research and analysis, they finally determined the more advanced and reliable target of increasing grain production by more than 50% and cotton by more than 40%.
    After doing this, they organized all cadres to go to the countryside and cooperatives in batches to approach the masses, improve their thinking, and revise the plans; at the same time, they strengthened specific leadership over the movement. They strive to have typical examples in everything, typical examples at every step, organize large-scale visits in a timely and universal manner, carry out socialist competitions, create model units, and reward models. For example, in the work of formulating plans, the county and district committees first helped a cooperative to formulate a plan, and then invited representatives from surrounding cooperatives to participate in the discussion. This not only improved the original plan, but also trained the representatives and helped them find the way to formulate plans. The Secretary and County Head of Guan County discovered the advanced experience of a cooperative installing a waterwheel diagonally in a water pit, and organized nine visits successively, which greatly promoted the county. The entire special district promoted surrounding cooperatives to participate in the competition movement through 1,574 central cooperatives, which played a certain role in ensuring production increase. Some cooperatives also conducted timely summary, evaluation, and reward of model work in winter plowing, which also yielded good results.
    Now, a vigorous and unprecedented winter production movement has been launched throughout the region. The winter plowing work on 5.81 million mu of land in the entire region was completed in one month, and the winter plowing area reached three and a half times that of 1954, and 90% was deep plowing.
    As soon as the winter plowing ended, the work of deep plowing, deep turning, sand pressing, alkali transformation, soil improvement, and elimination of wasteland began. By mid-December 1955, the entire region had deeply turned more than 450,000 mu of land, transformed 150,000 mu of alkali land, and eliminated 80,000 mu of sandy wasteland and wasteland at the heads of villages. Along the Yellow River in Shouzhang and Fan Counties, more than 60,000 people were turning silt and pressing sand day and night. The masses' slogan is: "Fight the desolate sand at night to turn it into fertile land, strive to yield a thousand catties per mu, and support the country's construction with capital!" In Guanchao County, 60,000 people also turned the land every day, including 20,000 women. Anyone who has been to this area cannot help but be inspired by the enthusiastic scene of "red flags during the day and red lights at night."
    The production activities of building ditches, terraced fields, large terraced fields, and building embankments are also rapidly unfolding. By mid-December last year, the entire region had built 1.2 million mu of large terraced fields and 350,000 mu of ditches and terraced fields. The construction of ditches and terraced fields in five large depressions, including Baijiawa in Liaocheng, has begun, with 20,000 people participating every day, which will free 130,000 mu of land from floods after completion. The work of repairing ditches and terraced fields in 16 large depressions in Guanchao County has also begun. The largest, Mengpo Depression, used to flood 4,800 mu of land every year; this time, three townships jointly fought for three days and nights, digging 12 ditches. The cooperative members proudly said: "In the past, King Qi once met with the feudal lords here. Now we are engaging in large-scale ditch and terraced field construction here. This place is a water pit this year, and next year we will call it a grain storage!"
    The scale and speed of winter watering of wheat are also unprecedented. The entire region planned to winter water 900,000 mu of wheat, and as a result, more than 600,000 mu were watered in 20 days, exceeding four and a half times the area watered in the spring last year. According to statistics from 10 counties in December last year, topdressing and hoeing of wheat reached one million mu, and the utilization of waterwheels and water wells reached 70% to 100%. Waterwheels in many areas were sold out, and kerosene lamps, ropes, and iron nails were also snapped up. Along the Yellow River, the Grand Canal, the Majia River, the Tuhai River, and the Wei River, many villages were diverting water to irrigate wheat, and the water level of the Grand Canal dropped by one and a half feet in three days. Boping, Liaocheng, and three other counties have also used 256 water storage pits to irrigate wheat. The entire region has already built more than 10,000 brick wells and more than 30,000 earthen wells. According to the facts of increased production from winter watering last year, winter watering and topdressing can increase production by 50 to 100 catties per mu.
    During the production movement, the socialist consciousness of cadres and the vast number of cooperative members has been further enhanced, and their confidence in increasing production has become stronger and stronger. A large number of model figures have emerged in the production movement, demonstrating a strong will to overcome difficulties and a spirit of innovation. In the turning of silt and pressing of sand, and in the construction of ditches and terraced fields, if one village or one cooperative is unable to carry it out, several cooperatives or even several townships will act jointly. Some have improved the method of turning the land, changing from plowing first, then casing, and then digging, to plowing first, then turning, and then plowing again, which doubles the efficiency and also ensures good quality. In the watering of wheat, because the pit water is low, people build high ridges and long ditches to irrigate. They also used methods such as connecting river wells, connecting pit wells, connecting waterwheels, connecting water wells, and pouring from one bay to another, overcoming many difficulties encountered in watering wheat. Slogans such as "More labor, more grain, build the motherland with strength" have become a huge motivating force, inspiring people's socialist labor enthusiasm.

    聊城地区的农业生产高潮
    张云林　周伟云
    山东省聊城地区基本实现半社会主义的农业合作化以后，各级党委紧接着就制定了各级的和农业生产合作社的生产规划，有力地促进了全区新的生产高潮的到来。
    聊城地区的生产规划是很实际的，也是很有魄力的。全专区共有1，300万亩耕地。其中1，000万亩平原过去水土自由流失，十年九旱，先旱后淹；300万亩低洼地历来春旱秋涝，秋后再旱。因此，产量都很低。处在个体经济时代，农民对于改变这种情况是无能为力的。现在，有了合作社，他们就完全有把握在今年一年内把1，000万亩平原全部修成大地畦田——即在大地中修起一尺左右的埂子，拦蓄雨水，把300万亩低洼地在今年春前用修筑沟洫、台田等办法全部变成好地。全专区1，300万亩耕地中，有沙碱地330万亩；在旧社会，沙碱地每年打不下粮食还得完粮纳税，有些农民因而家破人亡。现在，他们决定在一年内要把100万亩沙碱地改为良田，三年内全部改造完毕。过去，农民由于力量单薄，不能因地制宜地种植作物，大部种的是低产作物。现在，他们决定在一年内把高产作物由100万亩增加到500万亩。全专区原来只有32万亩水浇地，今年计划发动合作社再打新井5万眼、下泉5万眼，增加水车6万部；加上引用河水、坑水等，今年即可把150万到200万亩旱地变成水浇地。过去这一带养猪少、积肥少，今年一年内即可由16万只猪增至90万只。加上别的积肥活动，全专区粗肥可比去年增加一倍以上。过去因受虫灾每年平均减产一成以上；今年，除了加紧预防工作和充分利用已有设备外，再增购喷粉器2万部、喷雾器3万部，即可保证把虫害消灭在点片阶段，不致成灾。过去耕作粗放，推广新技术极为困难；今年，凡是试行有效的成熟经验，都可以纳入合作社的生产计划，保证按规格实施。他们坚定地相信，只要实现了这些措施，全专区的粮食就可以从1950年以来每年增产1.7％的老规律，一跃而为增产50％以上，棉花可以增产40％以上。
    聊城地区制定生产规划的过程并不是一帆风顺的。他们曾碰到了一些工作人员的各种不同形式的右倾保守思想的抵抗。这种右倾保守思想主要是不能自觉地从合作经济的新情况出发，而拘守着一切从小农经济出发的陈旧观点；对社会主义革命缺乏一种自觉的勇往直前的革命精神，甚至缺乏政治上的责任感。明明一年二年就可以办到的事，硬要拖三年五年。
    中共聊城地区党组织为了克服干部的右倾保守思想，在帮助各级干部从思想上认清当前农村中的经济基础已经发生了根本性质的变化的同时，强调接近群众，深入实际进行调查研究工作。他们去年8月间订的增产指标是8％，10月改订为争取增产12％。后来，地委亲自下乡调查了20多个农业合作社，才认识到过去右倾保守思想的严重，打算把增产指标改为40％。再后来，地委和各部委又一次下乡，调查了60多个农业合作社的增产情况，并且实地观察了各个合作社冬季生产活动，又经过多方面研究分析，才最后确定了增产粮食50％以上、棉花40％以上这个比较先进和可靠的指标。
    他们这样做了以后，又组织所有干部分批下乡、下社，接近群众，提高思想，修订规划；同时，加强了对运动的具体领导。他们力求做到事事有典型，步步有典型，及时而普遍地组织大规模参观，开展社会主义竞赛，创造模范单位和奖励模范。例如在制定规划工作中，先由县委区委帮助一个社订出规划，而后吸收周围社的代表参加讨论。这样，既提高了原计划，又训练了代表，帮助他们找到制定规划的门径。冠县县委书记、县长发现一个社在水坑中斜装水车的先进经验，先后组织九次参观，对全县起了很大的推动作用。全专区通过1，574个中心社带动周围社参加竞赛运动，对保证增产起了一定的作用。还有些社在冬耕中及时进行了总结评比奖励模范工作，收效也很好。
    现在，一个轰轰烈烈的、规模空前的冬季生产运动已经在全区范围内开展起来。全区581万亩地的冬耕工作，一个月就全部完成，冬耕面积达1954年的三倍半，并且90％是深耕。
    冬耕刚结束，深刨深翻、压沙改碱、改良土壤、消灭荒地的工作就展开了。到1955年12月中旬，全区已经深翻地45万多亩，改碱地15万亩，消灭沙荒和村头荒地8万亩。黄河沿岸的寿张、范县每天有6万多人日夜翻淤压沙。群众的口号是：“夜战荒沙变良田，争取一亩打一千，支援祖国建设有本钱！”观朝县每天也有6万人翻地，其中妇女有两万人。到过这一带的人都不能不被那“白天一片红旗、夜晚一片红灯”的热烈场面所鼓舞。
    修筑沟洫畦田、大地畦田和筑台田的生产活动也迅速展开了。到去年12月中旬，全区已经修大地畦田120万亩，沟洫畦田35万亩。聊城白家洼等五处大洼的沟洫畦田已经动工，每天有两万人参加，完成后可使13万亩地免除水患。观朝县16处大洼修沟洫畦田的工作也都开始了。最大的孟坡洼，过去每年淹地4，800亩；这次三乡联合连战三昼夜，挖沟12条。社员们自豪地说：“过去齐王曾在此大会诸侯，现在我们在此大搞沟洫畦田。这里今年是水坑，明年就叫它变成粮食囤！”
    冬浇小麦的规模和速度也是空前的。全区计划冬浇小麦90万亩，结果20天就浇了60多万亩，超过去年春浇面积的四倍半。据去年12月间10个县统计，追肥、锄麦达到百万亩，水车水井利用到70％到100％。许多地区的水车都脱销了，汽灯、绳索、铁钉等也被抢购一空。黄河、运河、马颊河、徒骇河、卫河等河流沿岸地区，许多村庄在引水浇麦，运河河水三天降落了一尺半。博平、聊城等三个县也已使用256个积水坑浇麦。全区已经打砖井1万多眼，土井3万多眼。据当地去年冬浇增产的事实证明：冬浇追肥每亩可增产50斤至100斤。
    在生产运动中，干部和广大社员的社会主义觉悟进一步提高，增产信心也越来越强。在生产运动中涌现了大批模范人物，表现了克服困难的坚强意志和创造精神。在翻淤压沙、沟洫畦田中，一村一社无力进行，就几个社以至几个乡联合行动。有的改进了翻地方法，由先犁后套再刨，改为先犁后翻再犁，效率提高一倍以上，质量也很好。在浇麦中，因坑水低，人们就筑起高垄沟，并流远浇。他们还运用了通河井、通坑井、水车连水车、水井连水井、一湾倒一湾等办法，克服了浇麦中遇到的许多困难。“多劳动，多打粮，建设祖国有力量”等口号，成为一种巨大的鼓动力量，鼓舞着人们的社会主义劳动热情。
