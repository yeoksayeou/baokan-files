Xinhua News Agency, January 20th – Employees from seven coal production, construction, and geological exploration units today separately proposed to coal workers nationwide to launch inter-mine competition and competition among workers in the same trades, to ensure the early completion of the First Five-Year Plan. These seven units are: the Chengzi Mine of the state-owned Jingxi Mining Bureau, the Liu Jiuxue Coal Mining Team of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, the Li Baoshu Tunneling Team of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, the Wangjiahe No. 3 Shaft Sinking Team of the Tongchuan Mining Bureau, the Xieji Ji No. 2 Well South Transport Tunneling Team of the Huainan Mining Bureau, the 139 Drilling Team and the No. 34 Drilling Rig of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau.

In their proposals, in addition to putting forward conditions such as reaching the 1957 coal production target one year ahead of schedule, speeding up mine construction, providing timely and excellent geological reports, improving the quality of raw coal and work, reducing costs, increasing labor productivity, and ensuring safe production, they also proposed specific measures to ensure the realization of these conditions.

The representatives of these seven units, after reading out their proposals at the ongoing National Committee Meeting of the China Coal Miners' Union today, received the support and approval of all the committee members attending the meeting. The meeting specially passed a resolution, calling on coal miners, engineering technicians, and management personnel across the country to actively respond to their proposals. The National Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union is also preparing to jointly issue instructions with the Ministry of Coal Industry, calling on all employees to further carry out socialist competition.
