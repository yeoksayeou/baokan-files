    Preventing the Spread of Crop Diseases, Pests, and Weeds
    Lin Ying, Deputy Director of the Plant Quarantine Department of the Plant Protection Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture
    The task of plant quarantine work is to prohibit the import of dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds with plants and their products from abroad and the export from the country; to block dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds that occur in local areas of the country within a certain range, and to prohibit them from spreading with plants and plant products, so as to completely eliminate them in their infection source areas. This is an important measure to protect agricultural production.
    Various diseases and insects, in their life process, spend a long time latent inside the plant body or attached to the surface of the plant. Thus, they spread to various places along with these parasitic plants, especially the transportation of seeds and seedlings.
    Looking back at the history of the spread of various extremely harmful diseases and insects in the world and within our country, one cannot help but be shocked. For example, the pink bollworm of cotton, which first occurred in Egypt, spread to the world's major cotton-producing areas after 1929. After being introduced into China with American cotton, it has now spread throughout the country except for Xinjiang and western Gansu. The potato tuber moth was introduced into Guizhou and Sichuan from the United States in 1941 with American potato seeds, and has now spread to 14 counties. Sweet potato black rot was introduced into China from Japan during the War of Resistance Against Japan, first occurring in individual areas of Hebei, and has now spread throughout the area north of the Yangtze River.
    Our country has established a foreign quarantine system, effectively preventing the invasion of dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds from abroad; at the same time, strict quarantine inspections and disinfection treatments have also been carried out on seeds, seedlings, and agricultural products exported abroad. Domestic quarantine, which began in 1954, has established plant quarantine stations in all provinces and cities across the country, and has begun preliminary investigation, research, and blockade and elimination work on various dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds. With the help of Soviet experts, preliminary investigations have been carried out on more than 30 kinds of dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds in the seven provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shandong, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. According to the results of the investigation, various interim quarantine measures have been formulated, and quarantine work publicity and training have been carried out, laying the foundation for the establishment of a domestic quarantine system.
    In the future, with the upsurge of agricultural production and the development of transportation, the transfer of seeds and seedlings will become more frequent. If plant quarantine work is not strengthened, various dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds will spread more severely with seeds and seedlings. Therefore, while carrying out the elimination of the ten major crop pests and diseases in various places, quarantine measures must be actively taken against various dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds to protect areas where they have not yet occurred. For example, sweet potato black rot has not yet occurred in most areas of southern China. These areas should be immediately designated as protected areas to prevent the introduction of black rot, and it is strictly forbidden to bring diseased sweet potatoes into these areas. Rice bakanae disease occurs locally in Yunnan and Guangxi, apple rust disease occurs sporadically in Liaoning and Hebei, and citrus fruit flies occur locally in Sichuan, Guizhou, Hubei, and other places. Epidemic areas should be designated for these locally and sporadically occurring diseases and insects to implement blockades, and it is strictly forbidden to transport seeds, seedlings, branches, and diseased and insect-infested fruits from epidemic areas. Prevention and control should be strengthened within the area to completely eliminate these diseases and insects.
    People often do not pay much attention to newly occurring dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds, allowing them to have opportunities to breed and spread. For example, the persimmon geometrid moth and the Catalpa sphinx moth occurred in Haozhao Village, Shexian County in 1943. By 1950, they had spread to many villages and caused serious damage. Prevention and control were carried out only then. Currently, they have spread to more than 100 villages in eight or nine counties including Wu'an, Cixian, Linxian, and Pingshun, and a lot of manpower and resources have to be invested in prevention and control every year. There are many similar facts. The idea of "emphasizing treatment over prevention" must be completely overcome.
    To widely carry out plant quarantine work and prevent the spread and harm of dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds, the masses must be mobilized to do a good job. Now, the semi-socialist agricultural cooperation in the country is about to be basically completed, and the management of agricultural products such as seeds and seedlings is becoming increasingly centralized, creating fundamental favorable conditions for plant quarantine work. Active individuals with a certain level of education should be selected in each agricultural production cooperative and taught quarantine knowledge to serve as quarantine representatives in the cooperative. Under the overall planning and guidance of the agricultural department, they should organize the masses at any time to eliminate dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds occurring in their villages and cooperatives in a timely manner, and be responsible for the quarantine work of seed and seedling import and export within the cooperative. This is a good way to carry out mass quarantine work.
    Scientific research institutions, farms of higher agricultural schools, and various experimental stations and breeding farms are all bases for the breeding and promotion of excellent varieties. In the past, many units did not pay attention to the spread of dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds when promoting improved varieties. This phenomenon must be corrected. Each farm and station should formulate quarantine measures, select quarantine representatives, do a good job in quarantine work, and become a model for implementing national quarantine laws and systems.
    While introducing high-yield crop seeds and seedlings, all localities must consider the long-term interests of protecting agricultural production and strengthen quarantine work.
    Plant quarantine is a new task, and the general public still lacks sufficient understanding of its importance and lacks experience. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct extensive publicity and education, train quarantine workers and quarantine backbones of agricultural production cooperatives in a planned manner; and organize the forces of technical extension stations, agricultural scientific research institutions, and agricultural colleges to jointly conduct investigations, research, and blockade and elimination work on dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds.

    防止农作物病虫杂草蔓延为害
    农业部植物保护局植物检疫处副处长  林英
    植物检疫工作的任务是：禁止危险病、虫、杂草随着植物及其产品由国外输入和由国内输出；把发生在国内局部地区的危险病、虫、杂草封锁在一定的范围内，禁止它们随着植物和植物产品传播蔓延，以便把它们彻底肃清在它们的感染发源地。这是保护农业生产的重要措施。
    各种病、虫，在它们的生活过程中，有很长时间是潜伏在植物体的内部，或者附着在植物的表面，因而就随着这些寄生植物，特别是种籽、苗木的运输，传播到各地。
    翻阅一下世界各国及我国内部若干为害极为严重的病、虫的传播史，就不能不引起我们的震惊。如棉花红铃虫，最早发生在埃及，1929年以后传遍了世界各主要产棉区；随着美棉传入我国以后，现在除新疆和甘肃西部外，已传遍全国。马铃薯块茎蛾于1941年随着美国的马铃薯种传入贵州、四川，目前已传播到14个县。甘薯黑斑病在抗日战争时期由日本传到我国，首先在河北个别地区发生，现在已经传遍长江以北。
    我国已经建立了对外检疫制度，有效地防止了国外危险病、虫、杂草的侵入；同时对出国的种籽、苗木和农产品也进行了严格的检疫检查和消毒处理。对内检疫，从1954年开始，已经在全国各省、市建立了植物检疫站，并且开始对各种危险病、虫、杂草进行了初步调查研究和封锁消灭工作。在苏联专家帮助下，已经对四川、湖南、江西、山东、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江七省的30多种危险病、虫、杂草作了初步调查，并根据调查结果制定了各种暂行的检疫办法，开展了检疫工作的宣传训练，为建立对内检疫制度奠定了基础。
    今后，随着农事生产的高涨和交通运输的发展，种籽、苗木的调运将更加频繁，如果不加强植物检疫工作，各种危险病、虫、杂草就会随着种籽、苗木传播得更加厉害。因此，在各地进行消灭十大病虫害的同时，必须对各种危险病、虫、杂草积极采取检疫措施，保护还没有发生的地区。例如：甘薯黑斑病目前江南绝大部分地区还没有发生，这些地区应立即划为防止黑斑病传入的保护区，严禁带病的甘薯进入。水稻一柱香病在云南、广西局部发生，苹果锈果病在辽宁、河北零星发生，柑桔大实蝇在四川、贵州、湖北等地局部发生；对这些局部及零星发生的病、虫应划定疫区实行封锁，严禁疫区的种籽、苗木、枝条及病虫果外运，并在区内加强防治，彻底肃清这些病、虫。
    人们往往对刚刚发生的危险病、虫、杂草不大注意，使它们有了繁殖蔓延的空子。如柿星尺蠖、木橑尺蠖，1943年在涉县的郝赵村发生，到1950年已经蔓延很多村，为害严重了，才进行防治，目前已蔓延到武安、磁县、林县、平顺等八、九个县的一百多村，每年都要投入很大的人力物力进行防治。类似这种事实很多。必须彻底克服这种“重治不重防”的思想。
    广泛开展植物检疫工作，防止危险病、虫、杂草的蔓延为害，要把广大群众发动起来，才能做好。现在，全国半社会主义的农业合作化即将基本完成，种籽、苗木等农产品的经营管理日渐集中，给植物检疫工作创造了根本的有利条件。应当在每个农业生产合作社里选定具有一定文化程度的积极分子，教给他们检疫知识，做为社里的检疫代表，使他们在农业部门的全面的规划和指导下随时组织群众及时消灭本村本社发生的危险病、虫、杂草，并负责社内种籽、苗木引进和调出的检疫工作。这是开展群众性检疫工作的好办法。
    科学研究机关、高等农业学校的农场，各试验站、繁殖场都是优良品种的繁殖推广的基地。过去许多单位在推广良种的时候没有注意到危险病、虫、杂草的传播，这种现象必须纠正。各场、站应制定检疫办法，选定检疫代表，做好检疫工作，成为贯彻执行国家检疫法律和制度的模范。
    各地在引进高产作物种籽、苗木的同时，必须考虑到保护农业生产的长远利益，加强检疫工作。
    植物检疫是一项新工作，一般群众对它的重要性还认识不足，并且缺乏经验。因此，必须进行广泛的宣传教育，有计划地训练检疫工作人员和农业生产合作社的检疫骨干；组织技术推广站、农业科学研究机关和农业院校的力量，共同做好危险病、虫、杂草的调查研究和封锁消灭工作。
