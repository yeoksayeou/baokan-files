    Taking the Cultivation of New Authors as an Important Responsibility
    Zhu Shulan
    Just by browsing through the "Script" monthly magazine for the whole year of 1955, we can discover that its most significant feature is that each issue has many new author names. Most of them are unknown authors. Among them are workers (such as Wu Guanghua, the author of "Unstoppable Torrent"), farmers (such as Hou Xiwang, the author of the short opera "Throwing the Boundary Stone"), teachers (such as Liu Houming, the author of "Summer is Coming"), and collective creations from rural amateur theatrical troupes (such as "A Family," created by the Xin'anji Amateur Theatrical Troupe of Liu'an). According to the statistics from the editorial department of "Script" monthly magazine, among the scripts published in 1955, works by young authors accounted for over 95%; over 90% of the authors published their plays for the first time. In the initial period of its founding in 1952, "Script" monthly magazine was often behind schedule, with one issue even delayed by a month. Now, in addition to publishing 160,000 characters of manuscripts each month, it also has a considerable number of reserve manuscripts. In 1955, it also published six special issues.
    The experience of "Script" monthly magazine in organizing creation has reference value for many newspapers and periodicals.
    In the early days of its establishment, the editorial department of "Script" monthly magazine set up two groups: a professional writer group and a general submissions group. At that time, the editorial department only paid attention to professional writers, especially established writers, and did not pay attention to young authors, especially amateur authors from the masses. They once called the "general submissions group" the "rejection group." Some people felt that very few reader submissions could be used, and spending a lot of time on returning manuscripts was a "waste of life," and even wanted to state in the call for manuscripts that "we will not accept submissions for the time being." The result of this practice of neglecting the creative power of the masses was the exhaustion of manuscript sources and the decline in the quality of the publication, which aroused reader dissatisfaction.
    The publication must continue to be published, it must be published well, and it must meet the requirements of the vast number of amateur and professional theatrical troupes. The editorial department had to reconsider opening up the narrow path of only relying on a few professional writers and finding a way out to young writers and the vast number of amateur authors. They took a series of measures: sending people to various places to establish contact with local literary and art organizations and many amateur authors. They stipulated that each editor must provide a certain number of manuscripts that can be considered for adoption or modification and processing out of every hundred submissions. They carefully offered opinions on the authors' manuscripts and creative outlines, sometimes entrusting the relevant local departments or established writers to guide the authors. In order to better help the authors of certain manuscripts with a basis for modification, the editorial department once invited authors from other places to Beijing, assigned dedicated personnel, or held small discussion meetings to provide assistance. Sometimes, through the theater, directors, actors, and authors were organized to go down to experience life together, using the collective power to enrich the script. The new opera "Song of the Grassland" was completed after such meticulous and specific organizational work.
    The care and help of the editorial department of "Script" monthly magazine for the vast number of amateur authors who love drama is relatively detailed. As long as the manuscript has a little commendable foundation, they always try their best to help the author repeatedly modify it. The original manuscript of "Unstoppable Torrent," written by Wu Guanghua, an 18-year-old worker at the Beijing Cooperative Printing Factory, was relatively rough. Because the author had a deep feeling for the ugly side of capitalists in life and loved writing, after more than four months and six or seven repeated modifications, it was finally written into the one-act drama that has been praised so much.
    The editorial department of "Script" monthly magazine learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in holding training classes. In March 1955, they invited more than 30 opera authors to participate in the "Opera Training Class" held by the Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Dramatists Association. Through collective discussion and research, more than 20 operas were compiled, more than 10 of which have been published in the two special issues of opera in "Script". The one-act drama solicitation and award evaluation held by "Script" monthly magazine in 1953 and 1954 also played a role in widely organizing and promoting playwriting.
    For the contact with author activists, in addition to assigning dedicated personnel to be responsible, the editorial department of "Script" monthly magazine also established registration forms, cards, and file bags for storing works and letters. They often wrote letters to understand the authors' implementation of their plans, introduced reference books to them, and answered questions. In this way, the editorial department gradually had a more comprehensive and profound understanding of the authors; and also established a deeper connection with the authors. Now, there are more than 450 author activists who have established this kind of connection with them.
    Fully relying on and utilizing social forces to promote and expand the influence of script creation is also one of the work experiences of "Script" monthly magazine in achieving results. The editorial department has established contact with many practical work departments, and has received the care and support of these departments, which has solved the difficulty that the editorial department cannot be familiar with all kinds of businesses. The editorial department also actively recommends some excellent plays to theaters and troupes. "Steel Transport Soldier," which was once warmly welcomed by the audience, was decided to be rehearsed after being recommended to the China Youth Art Theater by the editorial department. The multi-act drama "Spring Breeze Blows to Nomin River," which reflects agricultural cooperation, was performed 1,693 times by 39 professional drama troupes. The one-act drama "Women Representative" has been adapted into more than a dozen operas and is widely performed throughout the country.

    把培养新作者当作自己的重要职责
    朱树兰
    只要翻阅一下1955年全年的“剧本”月刊，我们就会发现，它的显著的特点是每期都有不少新作者名字。他们大部分是不知名的作者。其中有工人（如“挡不住的洪流”的作者吴光华），有农民（如小型戏曲“扔界石”的作者侯喜旺），有教师（如“夏天来了”的作者刘厚明），也有农村业余剧团的集体创作（如六安新安集业余剧团创作的“一家人”）。根据“剧本”月刊编辑部的统计，在1955年发表的剧本中，青年作者的作品占95％以上；90％以上的作者是第一次发表剧作。在1952年创刊初期，“剧本”月刊却常常脱期，有一期甚至拖延了1个月，现在则除了每月发表16万字的稿件以外，还可以有不少备用稿。1955年还出了6个专刊。
    “剧本”月刊的组织创作的经验对许多报刊来说都是有参考的价值的。
    在创办初期，“剧本”月刊编辑部设立了两个组：专业作家组和一般来稿组。当时，编辑部只注意专业作家，特别是老作家，对于青年作者、特别是群众中的业余作者就不注意。他们曾经把“一般来稿组”叫做“退稿组”。有的人觉得读者来稿能用的很少，花很多时间在退稿上是“生命的浪费”，甚至想在稿约中说明“暂时不收来稿”。这种忽视群众创作力量的做法的结果是稿源枯竭，刊物质量降低，引起读者的不满。
    刊物必须办下去，要办得好，要满足广大业余剧团和专业剧团的要求，编辑部就不能不重新考虑打开只依靠少数专业作家的狭窄的路子，向青年作家和广大的业余作者找寻出路。他们采取了一系列的措施：派人到各地去，通过各地文艺团体和许多业余作者建立联系。规定每个编辑人员必须在每百件来稿中，提供出一定数目的可以考虑采用或者修改、加工的稿件。他们对作者的稿件和创作提纲慎重地提出意见，有时候委托当地的有关部门或者老作家指导作者。为了更好地对某些有修改基础的稿件的作者进行具体的帮助，编辑部曾经邀请外地作者来北京，指定专人，或者举行小型讨论会，给以帮助。有时候，通过剧院组织导演、演员和作者一同下去体验生活，用集体的力量来充实剧本。新歌剧“草原之歌”就是经过这样细致的、具体的组织工作之后才完成的。
    “剧本”月刊编辑部对于广大爱好戏剧的业余作者的关心和帮助是比较细致的。只要稿件有一点可取的基础，总是尽量地帮助作者反复修改。北京合作印刷厂18岁的工人吴光华写的“挡不住的洪流”的原稿比较粗糙。由于作者在生活中对于资本家丑恶的一面有着深切的感受，又热爱写作，经过了四个多月、六、七次反复修改，终于写成了像现在这样一个获得好评的独幕话剧。
    “剧本”月刊编辑部学习了苏联举办讲习会的先进经验。1955年3月间约请了30多位戏曲作者，来参加文化部和中国戏剧家协会举办的“戏曲讲习会”。通过集体讨论和研究，整理出20多个戏曲，其中的10多个已经发表在“剧本”的两期戏曲专号上。“剧本”月刊在1953年和1954年两度举办的独幕话剧征稿评奖，也起了广泛地组织和推动剧作的作用。
    对于作者积极分子的联系，“剧本”月刊编辑部除指定了专人负责外，还建立了登记表、卡片，以及保存作品和信件的档案袋。他们经常写信去了解作者执行计划的情况，给他们介绍参考书，解答疑难。这样，编辑部逐渐对作者有了比较全面的深刻的了解；同作者也建立了比较深的联系。现在，和他们取得这种联系的作者积极分子，已经有450多人。
    充分地依靠和利用社会力量，推动和扩大剧本创作的影响，也是“剧本”月刊编辑部获得成绩的工作经验之一。编辑部同许多实际工作部门已经建立了联系，并且得到这些部门的关怀和支持，解决了编辑部不可能对各种业务都熟习的困难。编辑部也积极主动地向剧院和剧团推荐一些优秀的剧目。曾经受到观众热烈欢迎的“钢铁运输兵”，就是由编辑部向中国青年艺术剧院推荐以后才决定排演的。反映农业合作化的多幕剧“春风吹到诺敏河”，就由39个专业话剧团演出了1，693场。独幕话剧“妇女代表”被改编成了十多种戏曲，在全国各地普遍上演。
