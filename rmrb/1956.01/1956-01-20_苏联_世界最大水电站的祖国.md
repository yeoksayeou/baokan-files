    The Soviet Union: Homeland of the World's Largest Hydropower Stations
    In addition to building the world's largest Bratsk Hydroelectric Station (3.2 million kilowatts) on the Angara River, the Soviet Union will also build the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station (also 3.2 million kilowatts) on the Yenisei River. This is stipulated in the draft of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Islamuchad, the director of the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station Construction Bureau, stated in the "Izvestia" on the 19th that the site for the hydroelectric station has been selected, located 40 kilometers from Krasnoyarsk, near the village of Shumikha. In this area, the riverbanks are lined with high mountains and lush forests. The entire hydroelectric station will be built on granite. The reservoir will be 400 kilometers long, with a storage capacity of 107 billion cubic meters. The hydroelectric station will be poured with 7 million cubic meters of concrete and reinforced concrete. Before directly commencing the construction of the hydroelectric station, enormous preparatory work must be carried out. For example, a 105-kilometer railway network and two highways totaling 75 kilometers in length need to be built. The construction of roads leading to the hydroelectric station will require the excavation of steep cliffs. This work alone will involve excavating approximately 5 million cubic meters of rock and soil. Currently, two worker villages are being built on the outskirts of Krasnoyarsk, and a large number of multi-story buildings and office spaces are being constructed in the city. This year, construction of highways, mechanical repair workshops, oil depots, and other auxiliary enterprises will begin.

    苏联——世界最大水电站的祖国
    苏联除了在安哥拉河上建筑世界最大的布拉次克水电站（320万瓩）以外，还要在叶尼塞河上建筑也是320万瓩的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站。这是第六个五年计划草案规定的。克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站建筑局局长伊斯兰木查德在19日“消息报”上谈道：建筑水电站的地址已经选好，它离克拉斯诺雅尔斯克40公里，靠近舒米哈村。在这个地区的河岸高山群立，森林茂盛。全部水电站将建筑在花岗岩上。水库长达400公里，蓄水量1，070亿立方公尺。水电站将灌筑700万立方公尺混凝土和钢筋混凝土。在直接进行水电站的建筑之前，要进行巨大的准备工作。例如，要筑105公里的铁路网和共长75公里的两条公路。建筑各条通达水电站的道路时要开凿陡岩削壁。仅这一项工作，要凿岩掘土约500万立方公尺。现在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克郊外建筑着两个工人村，市内建筑大批多层楼房和办公处。今年内将开始建筑公路，机械修理工场，油库及其他辅助企业。
