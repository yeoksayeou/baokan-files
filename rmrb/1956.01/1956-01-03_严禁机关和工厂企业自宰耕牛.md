Strictly Prohibit Government Organs and Factories from Slaughtering Draught Cattle
    Zhu Bo

    In various parts of Shaanxi, it has been discovered that many government organs and factories are privately slaughtering so-called "disabled cattle." Recently, the various departments under the Shaanxi Branch of the State Materials Reserve Bureau slaughtered 23 cattle, the units under the Xi'an Food Company slaughtered 11 cattle, the People's Flour Mill slaughtered seven cattle, and dozens of units such as the Fuyu Flour Mill, Xi'an Pharmaceutical Factory, and suburban construction sites also privately slaughtered cattle. In Qianxian and Yichuan counties, government organs and state trading departments have also privately slaughtered so-called "disabled cattle." The aforementioned government organs and factories have also privately sent people to rural areas to抢购(qiǎnggòu) so-called "disabled cattle." Some department staff even had disputes with the local food company staff during the抢购(qiǎnggòu). This was the case with the personnel sent by the Xi'an People's Flour Mill to Xianyang to purchase cattle. The food company's purchasing personnel advised them not to privately purchase draught cattle and explained to them that privately purchasing draught cattle violates state regulations. Not only did they not listen, but they also quarreled with the food company's purchasing personnel and insisted on buying the cattle back.

    The reason given by the aforementioned government organs and factories for privately slaughtering cattle is said to be that there is not enough grain to eat, and they want to use beef to supplement the lack of grain. This is clearly an excuse. According to the understanding of the various government organs and factories, there is enough grain to eat. Even if there is not enough grain, why not take legitimate measures to solve the grain problem, but illegally slaughter draught cattle? Obviously, this reason does not exist. What is the real reason? It is to take advantage of it. Because the price of privately slaughtered cattle is very low, generally only about two jiao per jin of beef, and it is even possible to get meat to eat for free.

    The state has long stipulated that the purchase and slaughter of old, weak, and disabled cattle should be managed uniformly by the state food company (or cooperatives where there is no food company). In order to protect draught cattle, strict inspection systems have also been stipulated. The aforementioned units have all violated these regulations. Not only did they go to the countryside to抢购(qiǎnggòu) cattle, but most of the cattle they slaughtered were not inspected by the government's agricultural, forestry, and health departments. Therefore, it is difficult to say that there are no good cattle among the so-called "disabled cattle" they slaughtered.

    Privately slaughtering draught cattle has a very bad impact on rural production. Many farmers have expressed dissatisfaction with the aforementioned units and have gone to the local People's Committees and commercial management departments to accuse the aforementioned units of illegal acts. They demand that the act of privately slaughtering cattle be immediately prohibited. Local governments should investigate and deal with the illegal act of privately slaughtering draught cattle.

　　严禁机关和工厂企业自宰耕牛
    朱波
    陕西各地发现有不少的机关和工厂企业私自宰杀所谓“残废牛”的现象。最近，国家物资储备局陕西分局所属各部门宰杀了23头牛，西安市食品公司所属各单位宰杀了11头牛，人民面粉厂宰杀了七头牛，福裕面粉厂、西安制药厂、郊区建设工地等几十个单位，也私自宰杀了牛。在乾县、宜川等县的机关和国家贸易部门也发生了私自宰杀所谓“残废牛”的现象。上述机关和工厂企业还私自派人到农村抢购所谓“残废牛”。有些部门的工作人员，在抢购中还同当地食品公司的工作人员发生了争执。西安人民面粉厂派到咸阳购买牛的人员就是这样。食品公司的收购人员劝他们不要私自购买耕牛，并且向他们解释说：私自购买耕牛是违犯国家规定的。他们不但不听，反而同食品公司的收购人员吵闹，坚持把牛买了回来。
    上述机关和工厂企业私自宰杀牛的理由，据说是因为粮食不够吃，想用牛肉来补充粮食的不足。这显然是借口。根据对各机关、工厂企业的了解，粮食都是够吃的。就算是粮食不够吃吧，那么为什么不采取正当的办法来解决粮食问题，而违法去宰杀耕牛呢？很明显，这个理由是不存在的。真实的原因是什么呢？是想从中占便宜。因为私自宰杀的牛，肉价非常低，一般每斤牛肉的价钱只两角左右，甚至可以白赚肉吃。
    国家早就规定了老弱残牛的收购和屠宰，由国家的食品公司统一经营（没有食品公司的地方由合作社经营）。为了保护耕牛，还规定了严格的检查制度。上述各单位都违犯了这些规定。他们不仅到农村去抢购牛，而且他们宰杀的大部分牛，没有经过政府的农林和卫生部门的检验。因此，就很难说他们宰杀的所谓“残废牛”当中没有好牛。
    私自宰杀耕牛对农村的生产带来极坏的影响。已经有很多农民对上述单位表示不满，他们纷纷到当地的人民委员会和商业管理部门控告上述各单位的违法行为。他们要求立即禁止私自宰杀牛的行为。当地政府应该对私自宰杀耕牛的违法行为进行检查处理。
