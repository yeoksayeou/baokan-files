　　New Developments in Soviet Science and Technology
    Generating Electricity Using Semiconductors

    In Soviet geological exploration teams, fishing enterprises, in Soviet reclamation areas, and other remote places without electrification, a common kerosene lamp is used, fitted with a small lampshade, with a wire running from the lampshade to a nearby radio. This unusual "lampshade" is a miniature thermoelectric generator made of thin slices of semiconductor (silicon crystal). The "lampshade" is heated by the kerosene lamp, and it starts to emit electric current, enough to supply the radio's needs.

    Semiconductors can not only convert heat energy into electrical energy, but also replace radio vacuum tubes, thereby greatly reducing the size of radios, making multi-tube radios small enough to fit inside a watch case. Such radios already exist.

    When a regular electric current is passed through two welded semiconductors, one end heats up and the other cools down, immediately forming a layer of frost at room temperature. Therefore, semiconductors can be used to make refrigerators that are simple and cheap. Such refrigerators can cool down to -60 degrees Celsius and use very little electricity. A batch of such refrigerators has already been trial-produced.

    Semiconductors are substances that fall between electrically conductive metals and insulators. In semiconductors, the connections of electrons are relatively weak, so relying on heat, light, and other influences will strengthen the activity of electrons and improve the electrical conductivity of semiconductors. According to scientists' calculations, less than 20% of the fuel consumed by mankind is effective, and the rest is wasted. If semiconductor thermopiles are used, the situation will change. Anywhere there is a heat source that can be heated to two or three hundred degrees and a way to cool it down, a semiconductor thermopile can be installed, which can convert 5% to 10% of the heat energy into electrical energy. At that time, heating boilers, chimneys, and hot waste gas can all supply electricity.

    Solar energy can be converted into electrical energy through semiconductor photovoltaic cells. There are already semiconductor photovoltaic cells that, when exposed to sunlight, can generate enough electricity per square meter to light 50 light bulbs. When cheap and durable photovoltaic cells are manufactured in the future, deserts, roofs, seas, and lakes will become huge sources of electricity.

    Semiconductor instruments also bring broad prospects for machine automation and remote control. In Soviet factories, there are fast forging presses that can forge complex parts in a matter of seconds. It seems dangerous for workers to reach in and send parts. But semiconductor photocells ensure the safety of workers. When a hand blocks the light emitted by the photocell, the machine stops because there is no light and the current does not flow.

    Semiconductors have unlimited prospects for converting heat energy and light energy into electrical energy. The Soviet Academy of Sciences recently established a special Semiconductor Institute, led by Academician A.F. Ioffe, a Hero of Socialist Labor. He wrote: Now that atomic nuclei and semiconductors are being applied from the laboratory to technology, they will cause a real revolution in technology.

    Radiation Sickness Can Be Cured

    Imperialist atomic blackmailers once clamored that people affected by radiation are incurable. Soviet medicine holds a different view. A recent article in "Spark" magazine proves the correctness of the Soviet medical view. Not long ago, in a Soviet agency researching atomic energy, an accident occurred in an experimental reactor. The accident was immediately eliminated, but a scientific worker close to the uranium reactor was strongly affected by neutrons and gamma rays. After a few hours, the patient felt weak, drowsy, headache, nauseous, and then began to vomit. Young doctors Guskova and Baisogolov were responsible for treating him. To protect bone marrow cells and the blood-generating system, they frequently injected the patient with fresh blood containing sufficient white and red blood cells, used potassium chloride solution to strengthen blood vessels, used streptomycin and penicillin to eliminate infectious bacteria, and injected caffeine and bromine to regulate the central nervous system. All these drugs are very common, but it is important to use them accurately and on time. After three months, the patient recovered his health.

　　苏联科学技术中的新事物
    利用半导体发电
    在苏联地质探察队中，捕鱼企业中，在苏联垦荒区和其他还没有电气化的辽远偏僻地方，使用着一种普通煤油灯，上面戴着不大的灯罩，一条电线从灯罩牵到旁边的无线电收音机上。这种不平常的“灯罩”是由半导体（矽的结晶体）的薄片制成的极小的热电发生器。“灯罩”被煤油灯烘热，开始发出电流，这些电流量足够供应收音机的需要。
    半导体不单能够把热能变为电能，还能够代替无线电真空管，因而极度缩小收音机的体积，使多真空管的收音机小得可以装在表壳里。现在已经有这样的收音机。
    在两块焊接的半导体上通过普通电流的时候，它们一头变热，另一头变冷，在室内温度下立刻起一层霜。因此，半导体可以用来制造又简单又便宜的冰箱。这种冰箱能够冷到零下60度，用电极省。现在已经试制了一批这样的冰箱。
    半导体是介乎传电的金属和绝缘体之间的物质。在半导体中，电子的联系比较弱，所以依靠热、光和其他影响会加强电子的活动而提高半导体的传电的性能。据科学家计算，人类所费的燃料，只有不到20％起作用，其余的都白花了。要是利用半导体的热电堆，情况便会改观。在任何地方，如果有热源可以热到二、三百度又有冷却办法，那末可以装置半导体的热电堆，它能够把5％到10％的热能化为电能。那时，暖气锅炉、烟囱、热瓦斯都能够供给电力。
    太阳能可以经过半导体的光电堆变为电能。现在已经有半导体的光电堆，在太阳光照射下，每平方公尺所得的电力可以使50支光的灯泡发光。当将来制造出便宜的耐用的光电堆的时候，沙漠、屋顶、海、湖都将成为巨大的电力源泉。
    半导体的仪器也为机器的自动化和远距离操纵带来广阔的远景。在苏联工厂里有飞快的锻压机，它能够在几秒钟以内锻压出复杂的零件。工人伸手收送零件似乎很危险。但是半导体的光电池保证工人的安全。当手遮断光电池射出的光线的时候，机器便停止不动，因为没有光，电流便不通了。
    在变热能和光能为电能上，半导体有无可限量的前途。苏联科学院不久前成立了专门的半导体研究所，由社会主义劳动英雄亚·费·伊奥非院士领导。他写道：现在原子核和半导体从实验室运用到技术中去，将在技术中引起真正的革命。
    放射线的感染可以治疗
    帝国主义的原子讹诈家曾经扬言：受放射线影响的人是不治的。苏联医学持着不同的见解。最近“星火”杂志刊载的一件事，证明苏联医学见解的正确。不久以前，在苏联研究原子能的机关里，实验用的反应堆发生了事故。事故立即消除了，但是一位靠近铀反应堆的科学工作者受到中子和丙射线的强烈影响。过了几个小时，患者觉得全身软弱、昏昏欲睡、头痛、作呕，随后开始呕吐。年青的医生古斯科娃和巴伊索高洛夫负责治疗他。为了保护骨髓细胞和血液生成系统，他们经常向患者注射含有充足白红血球的新鲜血液，用氯化钾溶液增壮血管，用链霉素和青霉素消灭传染性的细菌，并注射咖啡因和溴来调节中枢神经系统。所有这些药物都是很普通的，只是要按时准确地使用它们。过了三个月，患者就恢复了健康。
