    Lies Expose Conspiracy, Intimidation is Not Strength
    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles published a conversation filled with lies and intimidation in the American magazine "Life." He admitted that in Korea, Indochina, and Taiwan, the American aggressor group had deliberately flirted with the brink of war, claiming that they brandished atomic bombs in those places, and as a result, scared the Chinese people and the people of the Far East. Therefore, he proclaimed that the policy of the American Republican government was a policy of brinkmanship.
    Dulles' lies precisely expose his own conspiracy to clamor for war. But it is impossible to fabricate history with lies. Since history cannot be written by Dulles' lies, his intimidation can never produce any strength or effect.
    Now let people see Dulles' lies and the actual situation.
    According to Dulles, the first war crisis occurred in June 1953. At that time, just when the realization of the Korean armistice, which peace-loving people all over the world longed for, was in sight, the Lee Seung-man group forcibly detained more than 20,000 Korean People's Army prisoners of war. Dulles believed that the Lee Seung-man group's actions to undermine the armistice would cause the negotiations to break down, "giving the Chinese Communists an opportunity to withdraw from the armistice negotiations and evade the issue of prisoner repatriation." However, "the Communists did not withdraw from the meeting." What was the reason for this? According to him, if the Korean-Chinese side "deadlocked the negotiations, the United States would resume the war on its own, expand the war to Manchuria, and use tactical atomic weapons." It seems that atomic blackmail took effect.
    Here, Dulles concealed the facts he knew for sure and fabricated things that did not exist at all. It was not the atomic bomb Dulles imagined that enabled the Korean armistice agreement to be reached, but the powerful strength of the Chinese and Korean people and the moral pressure exerted by peace-loving people all over the world on the aggressors; it was not that the Chinese people were frightened by "strong reactions," but that the American paper tiger was exposed. The truth is: the United States lost more than 390,000 soldiers in the three-year war of aggression against Korea (not including the losses of the Lee Seung-man group and other accomplice countries; this number exceeds the total number of American casualties in World War I); its invading army was driven back from the Yalu River to the 38th parallel, resulting in the first major defeat in American war history since 1812. The United States was opposed by peace-loving people all over the world and was subjected to various accusations from its allies and within the United States. This is what forced the United States to hold armistice negotiations. Despite this, the U.S. side tried its best to obstruct the conclusion of the negotiations. The Lee Seung-man group's hijacking of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war occurred against this background. Lee Seung-man's actions aroused angry protests from all sides. The United States was horrified by the anger of the world. Its negotiator, Harrison, had to guarantee to restrain the Lee Seung-man group from complying with the agreement and promised to recover the prisoners of war. At the same time, the Korean-Chinese forces launched a powerful offensive, destroying the US-Lee defense line 20 miles deep in mid-July in a very short period of time, defeating four of their divisions, and annihilating more than 26,000 people. In this way, the United States quickly signed the armistice agreement. These ironclad facts are more than enough to shatter Dulles' arrogant ravings.
    Dulles regarded the restoration of peace in Indochina as a second example of atomic blackmail taking effect. It is said that the Geneva Conference was able to reach an agreement because in April 1954, the United States and its allies were preparing to take "joint action" of international intervention. And "at the same time, two aircraft carriers carrying atomic bombs were dispatched to the South China Sea for action."
    Indeed, around the start of the Geneva Conference, Dulles ran all over Europe clamoring for some kind of "joint action." However, Dulles' clamoring not only aroused the opposition of the American people, but even the American ruling group and its allies did not approve. In the end, the United States' evil attempt to expand the Indochina war suffered a decisive blow and failed in the great victory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's liberation of Dien Bien Phu. It can be seen that the development of things did not follow the route of American aircraft carriers, but according to the peaceful will of the people of Indochina and the people of the world. A series of events revolved around the great victory of Dien Bien Phu: the French Laniel cabinet, which refused to recognize the legitimate rights of the people of Indochina, collapsed; before the Geneva Conference was over, Dulles returned to Washington with what Parisian newspapers called "the most sensational failure" of his life; the two aircraft carriers slipped away silently. Finally, the Geneva Accords were finally signed, and the United States stood isolated on the sidelines.
    Dulles also believes that the U.S. "Congressional authorization to use troops to repel a Chinese Communist attack on Taiwan" prevented the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, allowing the "deterrent policy" to play a role, and allowing the United States to "avoid" a third "all-out war."
    The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. No intimidation from the United States can make the Chinese people change their position. Indeed, the United States is trying to use the "U.S.-Chiang Mutual Defense Treaty" to obstruct our country's liberation of Taiwan. But soon after this war treaty was signed, our People's Liberation Army liberated Yijiangshan Island and Nan'ao Island, forcing Chiang's bandit troops to withdraw from Dachen and Nanjii. May I ask Dulles, where did your deterrent policy play a role? Of course, the Chinese people are willing to use peaceful negotiations to resolve the tense situation between China and the United States in the Taiwan region, but the Chinese people will never bow their heads under the intimidation of the United States. The Chinese people's determination to liberate their own territory is unwavering.
    Throughout the conversation, Dulles focused on boasting about the power of the atomic bomb, but the facts prove that waving the atomic bomb is of no use to the Chinese people, the Korean people, or the Indochinese people. On the contrary, it can only make the world's people's movement to defend peace even more elevated.

### 谎言暴露阴谋，恫吓不是力量

    谎言暴露阴谋，恫吓不是力量
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在美国“生活”杂志发表了一篇充满了谎言和恫吓的谈话。他承认在朝鲜、印度支那和台湾三个方面，美国侵略集团都曾有意钻到战争的边缘上去，据说他们在那些地方挥舞原子弹，结果就把中国人民和远东人民吓倒了。因此，他宣扬美国共和党政府的政策就是战争边缘的政策。
    杜勒斯的谎言恰恰倒暴露了他自己叫嚣战争的阴谋。但是用撒谎来假造历史是办不到的，既然历史不能由杜勒斯的谎言来写成，他的恫吓也决不能产生任何力量和作用。
    现在让人们看看杜勒斯的谎言和实际的情况吧。
    据杜勒斯说，第一次战争危机发生在1953年6月。当时，正是全世界爱好和平人士所渴望的朝鲜停战的实现在望的时候，李承晚集团强迫扣留了两万多名的朝鲜人民军被俘人员。杜勒斯认为，李承晚集团破坏停战的行动会引起谈判的破裂，“使中国共产党人有机会退出停战谈判和规避战俘遣返问题”。但是，“共产党人没有退出会议”。这是什么缘故呢？据他说，如果朝中方面“使谈判陷于僵局，美国将自行恢复战争，把战争扩大到满洲，并且使用战术原子武器”。好像是，原子讹诈发生了效力。
    在这里，杜勒斯隐瞒了他所知道的千真万确的事实，而杜撰了根本没有的东西。使朝鲜停战达成协议的并不是杜勒斯臆想中的原子弹，而是中朝人民的强大力量和全世界爱好和平人士对侵略者所施的道义上的压力；不是中国人民被“强有力的反应”吓倒了，而是美国的纸老虎被戳穿了。事实的真相是：美国在3年侵朝战争中损兵折将达39万多（不包括李承晚集团和其他帮凶国家的军队损失在内的，这个数字，超过了美国在第一次世界大战中伤亡的总和）；它的侵略军队从鸭绿江边被赶回到三八线上，从而在美国的战争史上出现了自1812年以来的第一次大失败。美国受到了全世界爱好和平人民的反对，遭到了它的盟国和美国内部各种的责难。这才使美国不得不举行停战谈判。尽管如此，美方却竭力阻挠谈判达成协议。李承晚集团劫走朝中战俘就是在这种背景下面产生的。李承晚的行动引起了各方面愤怒的抗议。美国被全世界的愤怒骇住了。它的谈判代表哈利逊不得不保证约束李承晚集团遵守协议，并且答应追回战俘。同时，朝中部队发动强大攻势，在7月中旬的极短时间内摧毁了美李纵深20里防线，击溃了他们4个师，歼灭了26，000余人之后，这样，美国才迅速地在停战协定上签了字。这些铁一般的事实足以粉碎杜勒斯的狂妄呓语而有余。
    杜勒斯把印度支那和平的恢复当作原子讹诈生效的第二个例证。据说，日内瓦会议所以能够达成协议，是因为1954年4月间美国和它的盟国准备采取国际干涉的“联合行动”。并且“同时派遣了两艘载有原子弹的航空母舰到南中国海去行动”。
    的确，在日内瓦会议开始前后，杜勒斯曾经跑遍了欧洲叫嚣要搞什么“联合行动”。可是杜勒斯的叫嚣不但激起了美国人民的反对，就是美国统治集团内部和它的盟国都不赞成。最后，美国竭力要扩大印度支那战争的罪恶企图，在越南民主共和国解放奠边府的巨大胜利中遭到了决定性的打击而归于失败。可见事情的发展，决不是跟着美国航空母舰的航线进行的，而是按着印度支那人民和全世界人民的和平意志进行的。围绕着奠边府的伟大胜利，发生了一系列的事件：拒绝承认印度支那人民合法权利的法国拉尼埃内阁垮台了；日内瓦会议还没有结束，杜勒斯如巴黎报纸所说的遭到他一生事业中“最轰动一时的失败”回到华盛顿去了；两艘航空母舰不声不响地溜之大吉了。最后是，日内瓦协议终于签字了，而美国孤立地站在一旁。
    杜勒斯又认为美国“国会授权可以使用军队击退中国共产党对台湾攻击的决议”，阻止了中国人民解放台湾，使“威慑政策”发挥了作用，使美国第三次“避免”了“全面战争”。
    中国人民一定要解放台湾。来自美国的任何恫吓，都不能使中国人民改变自己的立场。的确，美国是企图借“美蒋共同防御条约”来阻挠我国解放台湾的。但就在这一战争条约签字以后不久，我国人民解放军即解放了一江山岛和南澳岛，迫使蒋贼军撤出大陈和南麂。请问杜勒斯，你的威慑政策究竟在那里发生了作用？诚然，中国人民是愿意用和平谈判的方法来解决中美在台湾地区的紧张局势的，但是中国人民绝不会在美国的恫吓之下低头，中国人民解放自己的领土的决心，是坚定不移的。
    杜勒斯在通篇谈话中聚精会神地吹嘘原子弹的威力，但事实证明挥舞原子弹对于中国人民、朝鲜人民、印度支那人民毫无用处，相反地，它只能使全世界人民保卫和平的运动更加高涨。
