The Party believes that Chinese intellectuals were the first to awaken in the Chinese democratic revolution and often played a pioneering and bridging role. But it also pointed out that if intellectuals do not combine with the workers and peasants, they will accomplish nothing. This not only gives intellectuals a correct evaluation but also points out the direction for transforming intellectuals.

Since liberation, the Party and the government, following correct policies, have carried out a series of works among intellectuals. What is particularly worth mentioning is that the ideological remolding movement was widely launched in universities and colleges in 1952. Through this movement, most intellectuals initially established the view of serving the people, initially recognized the errors of subjectivism and individualism, and also aroused the belief in seeking progress. Although at that time, individual cadres leading the movement did not understand the laws of ideological development well enough and failed to adopt the method of convincing people with reason, instead resorting to crude and blunt methods, which caused some negative emotions among a small number of intellectuals and caused some losses; however, this was not the mainstream and essence of the movement. The smooth progress of departmental adjustments and teaching reforms was clearly the result of the ideological remolding movement. In the past three years, universities and colleges have achieved remarkable results in learning from the advanced Soviet science and technology and teaching experience, as well as in leveraging the collective strength of teachers to jointly study teaching materials and improve teaching methods. Most teachers feel that their level of Marxism-Leninism is insufficient and consciously attach importance to political theory learning.

After the departmental adjustments, the Party's work among intellectuals was further strengthened, and the intellectuals themselves gradually recognized the superiority of the new social system, thereby exerting initiative and enthusiasm. The achievements during the period of national economic recovery, the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, the successive completion of great projects, the increase in the quantity and quality of industrial products, the continuous emergence of inventions and innovations, and the importance and adoption of rationalization proposals have all played a great role in improving the ideological understanding of intellectuals. Most intellectuals and scientific and technological experts, seeing that the science they are good at has achieved practical results in construction, expressed sincere gratitude and voluntarily united around the Party, enthusiastically striving for the socialist construction of the motherland. Such development is normal and healthy.

The progress of intellectuals and the close relationship between the Party and intellectuals are inseparable from the efforts of Party organizations and Party member cadres in universities and colleges. Especially after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC, the Party organizations in schools improved their leadership methods, and Party member cadres improved their work styles. The responsible Party cadres in the schools can regularly meet with teachers and students to listen to their opinions to improve their work; and they attach importance to the convening of school affairs committees and department head meetings, promote democracy, and strengthen unity. Individual Party committee comrades can also go deep into the grassroots, participate in departmental and teaching and research group meetings, and teaching work inspections, and support correct propositions and point out erroneous views during meeting discussions. After the meeting, they also engage in individual conversations and in-depth persuasion, educating the masses with the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method. This strengthens the unity between the masses and the masses, and also strengthens the unity between the masses and the Party.

These are the main aspects. But it is not without shortcomings.

On the one hand, some Party members do not pay enough attention to the progressive side of the masses, often emphasizing their shortcomings, failing to listen to their opinions with an open mind, and patiently helping them, forming a gap between each other. On the other hand, they underestimate the progress of the masses and dare not carry out criticism boldly, tending to be accommodating. They have not earnestly educated individual teachers with serious individualistic ideas and prominent behavioral manifestations, which has also affected unity.

In schools, the work of unity must first be done well in departments and teaching and research groups to give play to collective strength and help improve teaching quality. Therefore, the leadership has equipped appropriate Party member cadres to strengthen this work. However, the effects are very different. For example, important Party member cadres in the department can go deep among the masses, collect opinions, frankly reflect them to the department head, and solve problems in a timely manner. Although he is not good at teaching, he can work hard to study and humbly assist the department head in carrying out his work. In this way, he can do a good job, strengthen unity within the department, and exert the role he should play. However, some Party member cadres have a limited understanding of teaching work, or pretend to know what they do not know, and make decisions rashly without consulting with the department head. As a result, corrections are made afterward, which is not only more than twice the work but also causes opinions from all sides. Some Party member cadres do not understand the teaching situation, nor do they study, but think they are confident. When their views are inconsistent with those of the department head, they cannot discuss well, which leads to estrangement. For example, Party members who serve as middle-level cadres in the department can generally exert organization and discipline and make achievements under the leadership of the department head. If there are suggestions, they must be considered and decided upon by the department head after deliberation. However, some individuals also put forward opinions to the department head with a must-do attitude; and when the department head assigns tasks, they deny them in a simple tone, lacking the spirit of mutual discussion. Generally, young Party member teachers in the teaching and research group can play a guaranteeing role in the work, making the teaching and research group director feel that the more Party member comrades there are, the easier the work is to carry out. However, there are also cases where the opposite is true. The opinions of Party member teachers have not yet been agreed upon by the teaching and research group director, so they go to implement them. Or they do not pay enough attention to their attitude at the teaching and research group meeting, which causes resentment among older teachers. This is detrimental to the work.

Generally, young teachers can work hard to learn from Soviet experts. However, sometimes they are limited by their level, and their understanding may not be correct. When older teachers put forward different understandings, they are considered not to attach importance to the opinions of Soviet experts. Although this can be clarified through discussion, the expression is self-satisfied and not humble enough, even Party member teachers are no exception.

At present, the relationship between Party members and non-Party members in universities and colleges is normal; but some Party members do not pay enough attention to the details of their words and deeds, especially individual Party member cadres with a short Party standing, who are either too reserved or too ostentatious, so that there is still some estrangement between Party members and non-Party members. However, the continuation of this situation also has its own responsibilities on the part of non-Party member cadres.

Unity is the guarantee for achieving victory in any work. The country has great expectations and demands on our intellectuals. We must improve our political level, strengthen unity, and work tirelessly to cultivate talent and develop scientific undertakings.

### 要团结得更好一些

    要团结得更好一些
    同济大学副教务长　吴之翰
    党认为中国的知识分子在中国的民主革命运动中是首先觉悟的成份，常常起着先锋的和桥梁的作用。但也指出，如果知识分子不同工农群众相结合，则将一事无成。这不仅给了知识分子以正确的评价，而且指出了改造知识分子的方向。
    解放以来，党和政府按照正确的政策，在知识分子当中进行了一系列的工作。特别值得提出的是：1952年在高等学校中普遍展开了思想改造运动。通过这次运动，一般知识分子都初步建立了为人民服务的观点，初步认识到主观主义和个人主义的错误，也引起了要求进步的信念。虽然当时由于领导运动的个别干部对于思想的发展规律认识不够，未能多采取以理服人的方式而流于生硬粗暴，使少数知识分子产生了一些消极情绪，造成一定的损失；但是这并非运动的主流和本质。院系调整和教学改革之能顺利进行，显然是思想改造运动的结果。在最近3年中，各高等学校在学习苏联的先进的科学技术和教学经验，以及发挥教师的集体力量共同钻研教材改进教学方法方面，取得了显著的成绩。一般的教师都感到自己的马克思列宁主义的水平不够而自觉地重视了政治理论学习。
    在院系调整之后，党在知识分子当中的工作有了进一步的加强，而知识分子本身也逐步认识到新社会制度的优越性，从而发挥了主动性和积极性。国民经济恢复期间的成就，第一个五年计划的实行，伟大工程的陆续完成，工业产品的量和质的提高，创造发明的不断涌现，合理化建议的被重视和采纳，这些都对于知识分子思想认识的提高起了莫大的作用。一般知识分子和科学技术专家看到自己所擅长的科学在建设中达到了实际的成果，表示了衷心的感谢而自愿团结在党的周围，热烈地为祖国的社会主义建设而努力。这样的发展是正常的健康的。
    知识分子的进步，党与知识分子关系的密切，是同在高等学校中的党组织和党员干部的努力分不开的。尤其在中共七届四中全会之后，校内党组织改进了领导方法，党员干部改进了工作作风。学校的党员负责干部能定期接见师生，听取群众意见，以改进工作；并且重视校务委员会和系主任会议的召开，发扬了民主，加强了团结。个别党委同志也能深入基层，参加系和教研组的会议以及教学工作的检查，并且在会议讨论之中，支持正确的主张，指出错误的看法。会后还个别交谈，深入劝导，以马克思列宁主义的立场观点和方法教育群众。这就加强了群众和群众之间的团结，同时也加强了群众和党的团结。
    这些是主要的方面。但也不是没有缺点的。
    一方面是有些党员对于群众的进步一面重视不够，往往强调他们的缺点，不能虚心倾听他们的意见，耐心地予以帮助，形成了相互间的隔阂。另一方面也是对于群众的进步估计不足，不敢放手进行批评，流于迁就。对于个别有严重的个人主义思想，而且在行为上有突出的表现的教师，并没有认真进行教育，这也影响了团结。
    在学校里面，首先要在系和教研组里做好团结工作，发挥集体力量，才能帮助教学质量的提高。因此领导方面配备了适当的党员干部，加强这方面的工作。但是效果是很不相同的。例如系的重要的党员干部，有的能够深入群众，搜集意见，率直地向系主任反映，及时地解决问题。虽其本人不长于教学，但能努力钻研，虚心地协助系主任进行工作。如此既能搞好工作，又能加强系内的团结，发挥了应起的作用。但也有些党员干部对教学工作一知半解，或者强不知以为知，处理问题不同系主任磋商，贸然决定。结果事后纠正，不仅事倍功半，而且酿成各方面的意见。也有些党员干部对于教学情况不了解，也不学习，反而自以为胸有成竹，遇到同系主任的看法不一致的时候，不能很好地商讨，产生了隔阂。又如党员担任系内中级干部的，一般固然能够发挥组织性和纪律性，在系主任领导之下有所建树，如有建议必经系主任从长考虑作出决定。但个别的也有以势在必行的态度，向系主任提出意见；而当系主任布置任务的时候，则又以简单语调加以否定，缺乏相互研讨的精神。一般教研组内的青年党员教师能对工作起保证作用，使教研组主任感到党员同志愈多，工作愈易于开展。但也有与此相反的。党员教师的意见尚未取得教研组主任的一致，就去执行。或者在教研组会议上不够注意态度，引起年长教师的反感。这对工作是不利的。
    一般青年教师都能努力向苏联专家学习。但有时限于水平，体会不一定正确。当年长教师提出不同体会的时候，反被认为不重视苏联专家的意见。这虽然可以经过讨论辩明正误，但是那种表现则为自满而不够虚心，虽党员教师也在所不免。
    目前，高等学校里面的党员和非党员的关系是正常的；但某些党员在言行小节上注意不够，尤其是个别党龄较短的党员干部，或者过于矜持，或者过露锋芒，致党员和非党员之间，还不能毫无隔阂。但这种情况的延续，在非党员干部方面，也自有其应负的责任。
    团结是取得任何工作胜利的保证。国家对于我们知识分子期待甚殷，要求亦切，我们必须提高政治水平，加强团结，为培养建设人才、发展科学事业而不懈努力。
