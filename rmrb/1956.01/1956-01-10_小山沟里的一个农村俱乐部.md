　　A Rural Club in a Small Mountain Village
    Zhai Hegui

    Anyanggou Village in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, is a small mountain village with over 130 households. Anyanggou Village had already collectivized in 1953, establishing a Star Agricultural Production Cooperative. With the improvement of material life, the masses' demand for cultural life has become very urgent, and various small and diverse cultural activities have greatly developed in recent years. The club was officially established in March of last year.

    When establishing the club, the first problem encountered was that some cadres were afraid that establishing the club would affect production. At that time, it was the very busy time of spring plowing and sowing, but many members were not in high spirits for production because they were not familiar with the "three fix" work (fixing of output quotas, work quotas, and land use). The troupe then used the model of cooperative member Liu Manyi's positive labor and production and love of public property to rehearse eight programs, which were widely publicized before and after meetings, in dining areas, fields, streets, and other occasions, thoroughly implementing the "three fix" policy among the masses. This solved the masses' ideological concerns and boosted their production enthusiasm. The cadres gradually became clear about the role of the club. The cooperative also organized cadres and activists to study for several nights, inspiring their confidence. Finally, the cooperative committee made the decision to establish the club. The members themselves repaired four old houses to serve as a fixed activity place for the club.

    The club's activity methods are: combining large-scale and small-scale activities, combining field activities and stage performances, and combining political propaganda and cultural activities. When going to the fields, activists would bring newspapers and books, carry loudspeakers, and some would sing songs, while others would recite rhymes. In the midst of intense labor, one could hear pleasant songs everywhere, and the loudspeaker would shout encouragement from the various hillsides. During breaks, some would read books, some would read newspapers, and some would look at pictures. Those who were illiterate would look at pictures and find literate people to read novels aloud. Last autumn, when the members were distributing grain in the threshing ground, it was very late every night. The club seized the opportunity to show slides and organize storytelling and ballad singing in the threshing ground. On holidays, festivals, or rainy days, the club would organize large-scale evening parties, not only showing slides and organizing storytelling and ballad singing, but also having the troupe perform various programs. In this way, the cultural life needs of the masses were met, and living habits were gradually changed. An old man said: "In the past, it was visiting neighbors, gambling, fighting, and gossiping, but now it's singing, dancing, reading books, reading newspapers, and learning culture."

    The club's activities have promoted the central work of various periods. For example: last summer, the crops suffered from hail, and the entire cooperative had 500 mu of land with missing seedlings. The cooperative planned to complete replanting in five days, but some elderly people had the idea of relying on heaven for food, not believing in the principle of man conquering nature. Some people were not in high spirits due to the difficult living conditions at the time or a lack of understanding of the relationship between the collective and the individual. The club educated the masses to increase production and practice economy, actively finding substitute foods to make up for the shortage of grain, and promoted the significance of man conquering nature and checking seedlings and replanting. Using the model facts of cooperative members Liu Manyi and Shi Letang not resting in the fields, continuously pulling rollers, weeding, and kicking clods, they compiled rhymes and storytelling materials, and drew slides. When carrying manure, the club organized children to compile rhymes and say everywhere: "Uncles, work hard, carry fast, carry full, for more grain production, we will study hard, learn knowledge, and grow up to work with the uncles." After hearing such propaganda, some members compiled clapper rhymes saying: "Hearing the clapper rhymes makes me very happy, carrying the load gives me strength." The club also re-sang songs from the Anti-Japanese War period such as "Blue Sky," "Red Earth Fortress," "General Zuoquan," and "Returning Land to the Home," allowing the masses to recall the hardships of the Anti-Japanese War and inspire fighting spirit. As a result, the entire village adjusted 1,500 jin of grain and actively sought substitute foods. This solved the grain problem, overcame the disaster, and production enthusiasm rose again.

    The club's activity forms are diverse, attracting the participation of the broad masses of different ages and different hobbies. Currently, 30% of the entire village directly participates in various cultural activities. They not only carried out activities in their own village, but also drove the development of club cultural activities in the surrounding villages.

　　小山沟里的一个农村俱乐部
    翟和贵
    山西省昔阳县安阳沟村是个小山沟，全村130多户。安阳沟村在1953年全村就已经合作化了，成立了一个明星农业生产合作社。随着物质生活的改善，群众对文化生活的要求很迫切，近年来，各种小型多样的文艺活动大为发展。去年3月里，正式建立了俱乐部。
    建立俱乐部的时候，首先遇到的问题，是一部分干部怕建立俱乐部影响生产。当时正是春耕播种非常紧张的时候，但是有不少社员生产情绪不高，原因是对“三定”工作不摸底。剧团便用模范社员刘满义劳动生产积极、爱护公共财产的模范事例，排演了八个节目在会前会后、饭场、田间、街头等场合进行了广泛的宣传，把“三定”政策，深入地贯彻到群众中去，解决了群众的思想顾虑，鼓舞起群众的生产情绪，干部对俱乐部的作用就逐渐认识清楚了。社里又组织了干部和积极分子进行了几个晚上的学习，启发了干部和积极分子的信心，最后，由社务委员会作了建立俱乐部的决定。社员们自己动手，修理了四间旧房子，作为俱乐部的固定活动场所。
    俱乐部的活动方法是：大型和小型相结合、田间和舞台相结合、政治宣传和文艺活动相结合。上地的时候，积极分子就带着报纸、图书，背着广播筒，有的唱着歌，有的说着顺口溜。在紧张的劳动中到处能听到愉快的歌声，广播筒在各个山腰里喊话鼓动。休息的时候，有的看书、有的读报、有的看图片。下地回来以后，俱乐部里就更活跃了。有的下棋，有的看书，不识字的人看画，找认识字的人朗读小说。去年秋天，社员们在场上分粮的时候，每天晚上分得很晚，俱乐部就抓住机会在场上放映幻灯，组织说唱。遇到假日、节日或者雨天，俱乐部就组织大型的晚会，不但放映幻灯、组织说唱，剧团还要演出各种节目。这样，就满足了群众的文化生活要求，逐渐改变了生活习惯。有位老人说：“从前是串门、赌钱、打架、说闲话，现在唱歌、跳舞、看书、看报、学文化。”
    俱乐部的活动推动了各个时期的中心工作。例如：去年夏天庄稼受了雹灾，全社有五百亩地缺苗断垅，社内计划五天完成补种，但是部分老年人有靠天吃饭的思想，不相信人定胜天的道理；一部分人是由于当时生活困难，或者是对集体同个人的关系认识不足，情绪不高。俱乐部就教育群众增产节约，积极找代食品弥补粮食的不够，宣传人定胜天、查苗补种的意义；用模范社员刘满义、史乐堂在地里不休息、连拉砘、带挽草和脚踢圪垃的模范事实，编写了顺口溜、说唱材料，绘制了幻灯片。在担粪的时候，俱乐部组织儿童们编了顺口溜到处说：“叔叔们，好好干，担的快，担的满，为了粮食多增产，我们好好把书念，学好知识，长大要和叔叔们一起干。”听了这样的宣传后，有的社员编了快板说：“听了快板很高兴，担起担来有了劲。”俱乐部又把抗日战争时期的歌曲“青天蓝天”、“红土炮台”、“左权将军”、“土地还家”等歌重新唱了起来，使群众回忆起抗日战争时期的艰苦，激发斗志。结果，全村调剂了1，500斤粮食，并且积极地找代食品。这样就解决了粮食问题，战胜了灾荒，生产情绪又高涨起来。
    俱乐部活动的形式是多种多样的，吸收了不同年龄和不同爱好的广大群众参加，全村现在一共有30％的人直接参加了各种文艺活动。他们不但在本村进行了活动，同时还带动了周围村子的俱乐部文艺活动的开展。
