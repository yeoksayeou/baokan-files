    Unleashing the Potential of Intellectuals
    Feng Youlan
    The Chinese Communist Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals is entirely correct. Since liberation, and up to the present, the vast majority of us intellectuals have accepted the Party's unity, education, and transformation, and have made great progress. We were originally mental laborers, and now we are working alongside other working people to build our great motherland. Witnessing the progress of the motherland, which in just a few years has leapt from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial status to become a world power building socialism, is truly like the rising sun, radiating boundless light. In this situation, the vast majority of us intellectuals, like other working people, are jubilant and willing to work hard, contributing our share to the great cause of building socialism.
    As the pace of socialist construction in our country accelerates, intellectuals must fully unleash their potential in order to play the greatest role. They have potential, but to unleash their potential, it is necessary to create some favorable conditions. Speaking from the perspective of intellectuals working in universities, I feel that there are about five problems that need to be solved.
    First, there is a need to formulate specific and comprehensive plans for the development of scientific research and education. In schools, we often feel overwhelmed with tasks, doing this one moment and that the next, just like the saying in the countryside, "putting down the pitchfork to pick up the broom, never a moment's rest." This is certainly due to the rapid development of the objective situation, leaving all aspects in a state of unpreparedness. However, the lack of comprehensive planning is also one of the reasons. However, once the Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education have determined long-term plans, this problem can be solved.
    Second, the use and arrangement of intellectuals need to be reasonably adjusted in accordance with the overall plan. As far as I know, there are still some intellectuals who are not in positions that truly suit their talents. A person's talent must be compatible with his position in order to be fully unleashed. For example, a bullet must be loaded into a gun of the correct caliber in order to be fired. If the caliber is not correct, the bullet cannot be fired; its power becomes an unreleased potential force.
    In terms of culture and education, there are now three major systems that use senior intellectuals: the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Culture, and the Academy of Sciences. It seems difficult for these three systems to communicate with each other. In this situation, even if a person's work is clearly unsuitable, it is difficult to obtain appropriate adjustments and arrangements. I hope this problem can be solved quickly.
    Third, it is necessary to supplement the necessary working equipment. In universities, the leadership attaches great importance to teaching and research equipment, but there are also areas that are not taken care of. To give an example, since the restructuring of departments in Peking University in 1952, the newly built school buildings have exceeded the total area of school buildings built in the past 30 years. However, the library has not been expanded. The library is the center of university research and learning, and the lifeblood of the university. The need for a new large library is very urgent, but it has not been built. In this way, not only can people's potential not be unleashed, but the potential of books cannot be unleashed either.
    Fourth, it is necessary to supplement appropriate research and teaching assistants. An important component of Soviet university teaching and research offices is the documentation room. Documentation clerks collect and master various materials related to relevant issues. Research work is carried out on this basis, which yields twice the result with half the effort. Peking University has said more than once that it wants to promote this system, but it has not been promoted. Three of the four teaching and research offices in the Department of Philosophy at Peking University do not have documentation clerks or any auxiliary personnel. Teachers prepare teaching materials or conduct research work, from looking up books, borrowing books, to completing drafts and copying, all of which is done by one person. This wastes a lot of time. This problem also needs to be solved as soon as possible.
    Fifth, it is necessary to appropriately adjust the treatment of some people. Generally speaking, the living standards of university professors are much better now than before liberation. However, if they do not have past savings or subsidies from manuscript fees and have a large family, life is still tight. Some people also have to do some household chores, which of course takes up their energy and time. Many people do not have extra money to buy books. However, most teachers like to buy books. They can read their own books at any time, and they can also make annotations on them at will. Buying books is a kind of joy for scholars. But now there are many teachers who cannot have this joy.
    Even those who can afford to buy books have their own problems, which is where to put them? It is difficult to find a place for books to "live" in a space of a dozen or several dozen square meters, in addition to people living there. Some books are packed in boxes. When they need them, they know they have them, but they still have to run to the library.
    During the transition period, all aspects should save money and accumulate funds for the country, which teachers can understand. But there is one thing they cannot understand: they feel that the difference in treatment between the main leaders of the school and themselves seems to be a bit too large. The salary table clearly stipulates that teachers' salaries can only reach the fourth grade. Grades one, two, and three are specifically set for the main leaders. Although there is talk of special-grade professors, no one has actually enjoyed this treatment. Teachers are not asking for egalitarianism, but they feel that this does not seem completely reasonable: they feel that the type of labor they do is different from that of the main leaders, and they do not necessarily have to be three grades lower than the main leaders.
    Most of the above problems are problems encountered in development, and will be gradually resolved in further development. In addition, we intellectuals ourselves have many shortcomings. This is also an obstacle to unleashing our potential forces.
    Some people say that today's intellectuals have two shortcomings: arrogance and self-abasement. As far as I have come into contact with, there are still relatively few intellectuals who are self-deprecating, and there are still more who are arrogant. My own shortcoming of arrogance is very great. This is also one of the reasons why intellectuals cannot stand in positions that truly suit their talents.
    If an arrogant intellectual is placed in the position he desires, his ability will not match and he will not be able to exert his strength. If he is not placed in the position he desires but is placed in a position that actually suits his ability, he will be emotional and will not be able to exert his strength, so his strength will always become potential. We intellectuals have many shortcomings, and what is said above is just an example. To overcome shortcomings, the main thing is to rely on criticism and self-criticism, but we have not yet fully mastered this weapon.
    The shortcomings of intellectuals should of course be overcome by the efforts of the intellectuals themselves. However, the leadership should also promote some advanced systems, so that intellectuals can be transformed through their work when these systems are promoted. In this regard, as far as Peking University is concerned, the leadership seems to be a bit conservative. To give an example, at the Peking University Council last year, Soviet experts suggested that comparisons be made between the various teaching and research offices. This is a new system, but the leadership did not do it, fearing that some people would not understand it, become emotional, and cause trouble. When a new advanced system is first promoted, some people will not understand it, become emotional, and may cause some minor troubles. But without going through this stage, advanced systems cannot be promoted. Without going through this stage, people's ideological transformation cannot be improved. Transformation must be transformed in practice, not just through a few self-criticisms.
    Chairman Mao said in his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "These comrades also underestimate the Communist Party's leadership in the countryside and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for the Communist Party." The Communist Party's leadership among intellectuals and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of intellectuals for the Communist Party should also not be underestimated.
    I dare say that the vast majority of intellectuals regard accepting the Party's leadership as the greatest glory. I fully believe that all obstacles that hinder intellectuals from unleashing their potential, whether subjective or objective, will gradually disappear under the leadership of the Party. Let us unleash our potential and strive to build our great socialist motherland.

    发挥知识分子的潜在力
    冯友兰
    中国共产党对于知识分子的团结、教育、改造的政策，是完全正确的。解放以后，至于现在，我们绝大多数的知识分子，都接受了党的团结、教育和改造，得到了很大的进步。我们本是脑力劳动者，现在跟其他劳动人民一起，建设我们的伟大的祖国。眼看着祖国的进步，几年之间，从半封建半殖民地的地位，一跃而为建设社会主义的世界强国，真是如旭日方升，光芒万丈。在这种情况下，我们绝大多数的知识分子，同其他劳动人民一样，都是欢欣鼓舞，愿意努力工作，在建设社会主义的伟大事业中，添上一分力量。
    在我国社会主义建设加快了速度的时候，知识分子必须把他们的潜力完全发挥出来，才可以起最大的作用。他们是有潜力的，可是为了发挥他们的潜力，需要创造一些有利的条件。就在大学工作的知识分子说，我觉得需要解决的问题约有五个。
    第一是需要对于科学研究和教育的发展作出具体的全面规划。我们在学校里，常常觉得任务重重而来，一会儿要做这，一会儿要做那，正像农村中所说的“丢下叉耙弄扫帚，一身不闲”。这当然是由于客观形势发展太快，各方面都有措手不及之势。但是全面规划不够，也是原因之一。不过，一旦科学院和高等教育部确定了远景计划，这个问题就可以解决了。
    第二是对于知识分子的使用和安排还需要跟着全面规划加以合理的调整。据我所知道的，还有些知识分子没有站在真正合乎他的才能的岗位上。一个人的才能必须跟他的岗位相适应，才可以完全发挥出来。比如一颗子弹，必须装在口径相合的枪炮上才可以打出去。如果口径不合，子弹就打不出去；它的力量就成了没有发挥出来的潜在力。
    就文教方面说，现在使用高级知识分子的部门，有三大系统：高等教育部、文化部和科学院。这三大系统好像很难通气。在这种情况下，有些人的工作虽是显然不合适，可是很难得到适当的调整和安排。希望这个问题能够很快解决。
    第三是需要补充必要的工作设备。在大学里，领导上是极重视教学研究的设备的，可是也有照顾不到的地方。举一个例说，北京大学从1952年院系调整以来，加建的校舍超过了过去30年所建筑的校舍的总面积。但是没有扩建图书馆。图书馆是大学研究学习的中心，是大学的命脉。一个新的大图书馆的需要，非常迫切，可是一直没有盖。这样不但人的潜力不能发挥，书的潜力也不能发挥。
    第四是需要补充适当的研究教学辅助人员。苏联大学教研室的一个重要组成部分是资料室。资料员收集掌握了各种有关问题的资料。研究工作在这个基础上进行，就事半功倍。北京大学不止一次地说要推广这个制度，可是总没有推广。北京大学哲学系哲学专业的四个教研室中有三个没有资料员，也没有任何辅助人员。教师预备教材或作研究工作，从查书、借书一直到完稿抄写，全是一人包办。这就浪费很多时间。这个问题也需要早日解决。
    第五是需要适当地调整一部分人的待遇。一般说起来，现在的大学教授的生活比解放以前是好多了。但是如果他没有过去的储蓄或者是稿费的贴补而家里人又多一点，生活还是很紧的。有些人还要作些家庭琐事，这当然占去了他的精力和时间。很多的人没有余钱买书。但是大多数的教师都喜欢买书。自己的书可以随时看，也可以在上面随意批点。买书是读书人的一种快乐。可是现在有很多的教师不能有这种快乐。
    能买书的人，也有他们的问题，就是买来放在什么地方？十几平方公尺或几十个平方公尺的地方，除了人住之外再找书“住”的地方，就困难了。有些书装在箱子里。用的时候，明知道自己有，可是还得跑图书馆。
    在过渡时期，各方面都应该节约，为国家积累资金，这是教师们都想得通的。但是有一点他们还想不通：他们觉得，在待遇上学校的主要负责人，跟他们的分别似乎太大一点。工资表上明确地规定，教师的工资只能到第四级。一、二、三级是专为主要负责人设的。虽然有特级教授之说，可是事实上还没有人享受这种待遇。教师们也不是要讲平均主义，可是他们觉得这样似乎也不完全合理：他们觉得，他们跟主要负责人劳动种类不同，不见得一定要比主要负责人低三级。
    以上这些问题大部分是发展中所遇到的问题，在进一步的发展中，会逐渐解决的。此外我们知识分子本身还有许多缺点。这也是发挥我们的潜在力量的阻碍。
    有人说，现在的知识分子有妄自尊大和妄自菲薄两种缺点。据我所接触到的，妄自菲薄的知识分子还是比较少数，还是妄自尊大的多，我自己的妄自尊大的缺点就是很大。这也是知识分子所以不能站在真正合乎他的才能的岗位上的一个原因。
    一个妄自尊大的知识分子，如果把他放在他所希望的岗位上，他能力不称，不能发挥力量。如果不把他放在他所希望的岗位上而放在实际上是合乎他的能力的岗位上，他闹情绪，也不能发挥他的力量，于是他的力量始终成为潜力。我们知识分子的缺点是很多的，上面所说，不过是一个例子。要克服缺点，主要的要靠批评和自我批评，但是我们还没有完全能掌握这个武器。
    知识分子的缺点，当然要靠知识分子自己努力去克服。但是领导上也要推行一些先进的制度，在推行这些制度时，使知识分子于工作中得到改造。在这一方面，就北京大学说，领导上似乎保守了一点。举一个例说吧，去年在北京大学校务委员会上，苏联专家建议在各教研室之间进行评比。这是新制度，可是领导上没有作，怕有些人想不通，闹情绪，出乱子。在开始推行一种先进制度的时候，有些人是会想不通，闹情绪，也许会出些小乱子。可是不经过这一关，先进制度就不能推行。不经过这一关，人的思想改造也不能提高一步。改造要在实践中改造，不是几个检讨就能改造的。
    毛主席在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中说：“这些同志还对于共产党在农村中的领导力量和广大农民对于共产党的热忱拥护这样一种情况，估计不足。”对于共产党在知识分子中的领导力量和广大知识分子对于共产党的热情拥护这样一种情况，也不可估计不足。
    我敢说：绝大多数知识分子都以接受党的领导为莫大的光荣。我完全相信，一切妨碍知识分子发挥潜力的阻碍，无论是主观的或者客观的，都会在党的领导下，逐渐地消失。让我们把潜力都发挥出来，为建设我们的伟大的社会主义祖国而努力。
