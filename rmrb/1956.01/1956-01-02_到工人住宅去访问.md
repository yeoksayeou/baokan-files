    Visiting Workers' Residences

    Recently, leading personnel from the Rolling Mill Project Company of the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company organized visitation groups to go to workers' residential areas, investigate the living conditions of the workers. The Party Secretary and the Manager of the company both held symposiums in the workers' residential areas. Through visits and investigations, they helped more than 110 workers' households overcome their living difficulties and allocated a large sum of relief funds. The Anshan Metal Structure Installation Company also resolved the workers' difficulties related to housing, clothing, and winter living. The workers said with emotion, "The Party cares about us so much, we have done too little work in the past, and we must respond to the Party's care with practical work in the future." He Gui, a worker in the Mechanical Section of the Third Team, became even more enthusiastic about production after receiving relief funds. He improved the method of planing shavings from the coal storage crane railway, increasing work efficiency by more than three times.

    As leaders of enterprises, we should not only care about the production work of the enterprise, but also pay close attention to and promptly help resolve the specific difficulties in the lives of the workers.

    到工人住宅去访问
    鞍山钢铁建设公司轧钢工程公司的领导人员，最近专门组织了访问小组，到职工住宅区去访问，调查职工的生活情况，公司的党委书记和经理都到工人住宅区去召集了座谈会。经过访问和调查，帮助克服了110多户职工的生活困难，并拨出了一大笔救济金。鞍山金属结构安装公司也解决了职工有关住、穿和冬季的生活困难问题。工人们感动地说：“党对我们这样关心，我们过去工作得太少啦，今后一定要在实际工作中来回答党对我们的关怀”。三队机械科工人贺贵得到救济金后，生产积极性更加提高，改进了贮煤吊车铁道刨屑方法，使工作效率提高了三倍多。
    作为企业的领导人，不仅要关心企业的生产工作，而且要十分关心和及时帮助解决职工生活中的具体困难。
