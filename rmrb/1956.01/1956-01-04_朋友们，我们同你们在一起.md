　　Friends, We Are With You
　　Steelworker of the Soviet Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Plant, F. Rukiyanov

　　In the northern Urals, in the ancient Nizhny Tagil, stands our Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Plant. Many Chinese comrades are familiar with it. Metallurgical personnel from Anshan Iron and Steel Company have come here more than once, and some are still interning here. Our factory is young, it was put into production not long before the Great Patriotic War. But all of us already have a glorious tradition of labor. The rapid steelmaking movement first originated and grew here in 1947.

　　After the July Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee, the rapid steelmaking method took on a particularly large scale. The Party set us the task: to produce as much iron, steel and steel products as possible to meet the needs of the national economy by using the latest technology, adopting the best working methods, and especially by using oxygen steelmaking.

　　The steelworkers of the No. 2 open hearth furnace workshop, where I work, have made contributions to the completion of the national plan. If we want to talk about outstanding events in 1955, then we should first mention the great achievements of all the personnel: the completion of the Five-Year Plan task on December 11, with an overproduction of approximately 30,000 tons of steel compared to the annual plan.

　　In our workshop, two out of every three heats of steel are made using the rapid steelmaking method. The teams of steelworkers like Comrades Zhetkov, Stepaniuk, Kiyakov, and Nekazakov did particularly well. They are generally recognized as advanced workers. I would also like to talk a little about our team, which includes Comrades Sechev, Lartsev, and Komashen. The No. 5 furnace we are in charge of is called "Komsomol-Youth," because all the workers here are young. All the team members have graduated from the factory apprentice school and technical school not long ago.

　　Knowledge has helped us. Now you cannot become a steelworker without in-depth study. The furnace is fully automated. Equipped with precision measuring instruments; all heavy operations are done by complex machines. According to the suggestions of innovators in the workshop, the furnace head has been improved, thus speeding up the smelting speed.

　　We produce almost three-quarters of the steel by the rapid steelmaking method. Therefore, we produce 440 kilograms of steel per square meter of furnace bottom area more than the original quota, but we cannot be satisfied with this achievement. Advanced steelworkers from the Kuznetsk and Magnitogorsk integrated enterprises have achieved much higher unit output. Our task is to catch up with them. In 1956, we will strive to achieve this. The working class, like all the working people of the Soviet Union, is preparing to welcome the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which will be held in February 1956. I am waiting for the Party Congress with particular anxiety. A few days ago, the Party organization of the workshop, the older comrades—the Communists—gave me great trust and accepted me into the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After deliberation in our team, we decided to start calculating the over-planned production of steel from the first few days of the New Year, and prepare 250 tons of metal beyond the plan as a gift by the time the Party Congress is held.

　　To be an advanced worker, you must constantly study and enrich your experience and knowledge. Comrade Pikula and I have both completed the three-year foreman school course without leaving our production posts. I continue to study at the metallurgical technical secondary school night school. In 1956, I will be promoted to the third grade. Many people in the workshop are studying.

　　Our metallurgical personnel are working excitedly and have full conditions for cultural rest. The factory has its own beautiful cultural palace, which has several halls, a library, and dozens of rooms for various group participants, game lovers, and so on.

　　We welcome the New Year with firm confidence and determination: we firmly believe that our country will achieve new outstanding victories in communist construction, and at the same time we are determined to put our share of contribution into this great cause. The Soviet people live a peaceful and happy life, using their labor to promote the prosperity of the motherland and promote the consolidation of world peace. We are happy and proud to have the great Chinese people standing shoulder to shoulder with us. When the comrades knew that I was writing this letter, they said:

　　"Please convey that the metallurgical personnel of Nizhny Tagil heartily congratulate the workers of People's China on the New Year, and wish them achievements in socialist construction, in industrialization and agricultural cooperation."

　　Dear friends, may the New Year be a year of new achievements for us all!

　　朋友们，我们同你们在一起
　　苏联新塔吉尔冶金工厂炼钢工人　弗·鲁基雅诺夫
    在乌拉尔北部，在古老的下塔吉尔，耸立着我们的新塔吉尔冶金工厂。很多中国同志都熟悉它。鞍山钢铁公司的冶金人员曾不止一次地到我们这里来，现在还有人在这里进行生产实习。我们的工厂还年轻，它是在伟大卫国战争以前不久投入生产的。但是我们大家已经有着光荣的劳动传统。快速炼钢运动就是在1947年首先在这里发端并成长起来的。
    在苏共中央七月全会以后，快速炼钢法采取了特别巨大的规模。党向我们提出任务：要通过运用最新技术、采取最好的工作方法，特别是通过运用氧气炼钢法，尽可能多生产些铁、钢和钢材，以满足国民经济的需要。
    我所在的二号平炉车间的炼钢工人，在完成国家计划中作出了贡献。如果要谈1955年的杰出事件，那末首先就应当提到全体人员的巨大成就：12月11日完成了五年计划的任务，较年度计划大约超额生产了三万吨钢。
    在我们车间，每三炉钢就有两炉是用快速炼钢法进行的。炼钢工人捷特科夫、斯捷潘纽克、基雅科夫、涅卡扎科夫等同志的小组工作做得特别好。它们被全体公认为先进者。我还要略微谈谈我们的小组，这个小组里有塞切夫、拉尔策夫、科玛申等同志。我们看管的五号炉被称作“共青团员—青年号”，因为在这里工作的全是青年。所有的组员都是从工厂艺徒学校和工艺学校出来不久的。
    知识帮助了我们。现在要是没有深入的学习就不能成为一个炼钢工人。熔炉完全是自动化的。装有精密的测量仪器；一切繁重的操作过程都由复杂的机器来做。根据车间里革新者的建议，改善了炉头，因而加快了熔炼速度。
    我们炼的钢差不多有四分之三是用快速炼钢法炼出的。因此，我们使每平方公尺的炉底面积较原定额多生产440公斤钢，但是我们不能满足于这个成绩。库兹涅茨克和马格尼托哥尔斯克联合企业的先进炼钢工人取得了更加高得多的单位产量。我们的任务是要赶上他们。1956年我们将力求做到这一点。工人阶级同苏联全体劳动人民一样，正在准备很好地迎接将在1956年2月召开的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会。我怀着特别焦急的心情等待党的代表大会召开。几天以前，车间的党组织、年长的同志——共产党员给予了我巨大的信任，接收我加入了苏联共产党。我们在小组里酝酿以后，决定从新年的最初几天起就开始计算超计划生产的钢，到党代表大会举行的时候为止，准备以计划以外的250吨金属作为献礼。
    为了做个先进者，就必须经常学习，丰富自己的经验和知识。我同皮库拉同志都曾不脱离生产地学完了三年制工长学校的课程。我在冶金专科中学夜校继续求学。1956年我就要升入三年级了。车间里很多人都在学习。
    我们的冶金人员兴奋地劳动着，同时有充分的条件进行文化休息。工厂有自己的漂亮的文化宫，文化宫有几个大厅，一个图书馆，还有几十个房间供各种小组的参加者、游戏的爱好者等等使用。
    我们怀着坚决的信心和决心迎接新年：我们坚决相信，我们的国家将在共产主义建设中取得新的卓越的胜利，同时我们决心在这个伟大事业中投入自己的一份贡献。苏联人过着和平、幸福的生活，用自己的劳动促进祖国的繁荣，促进世界和平的巩固。我们由于有伟大的中国人民同我们并肩前进而高兴和骄傲。当同志们知道我在写这封信的时候，他们说：
    “请你转达，新塔吉尔的冶金人员衷心地向人民中国的劳动者庆贺新年，并祝他们在社会主义建设中，在工业化和农业合作化中取得成就。”
    亲爱的朋友们，愿新的一年成为我们共同取得新成就的一年！
