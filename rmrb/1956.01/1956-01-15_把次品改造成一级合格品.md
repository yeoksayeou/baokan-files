To the Editor:

    In June 1955, I put forward a rationalization proposal that solved a critical problem in our factory (Chongqing Third Steel Plant). After this proposal was implemented, it transformed more than 1,100 tons of substandard tie plates into first-class qualified products, saving the country more than 66,000 yuan. More importantly, from July 1955 onwards, it ensured that the proportion of first-class products from the rolling mill exceeded the state's targets, reversing the situation where quality targets had not been met for a long time.

    In early April 1955, at the anti-waste exhibition in the factory, I saw that the waste caused by substandard tie plates produced by the rolling mill alone amounted to more than 800,000 yuan a year. I stood in front of those charts and waste products for a long time, deeply moved. The next day, I went to the rolling mill. I saw the inspectors standing next to the inspection table, using gauges to measure the three holes of the tie plates. With a "thump," they would throw one out. I picked up a few and measured them. The holes of these tie plates, discarded as "long-holed" rejects, were only about 20丝 (si, a unit of measurement, approximately 0.02 mm) too long. It was heartbreaking to see the tie plates so desperately needed for national railway construction meet such a fate! I am an old forger with 40 years of experience, and I know that in the hands of us forgers, tie plate holes that are only about 20 丝 too long can be modified into qualified products. I suggested manufacturing a mold to process the long-holed tie plates into first-class products.

    My suggestion received the support of the factory director, the head of the production section, and the specific assistance of comrades Liu Qinsheng, Shi Genhong, and Liang Yuncheng. The mold was quickly manufactured. When I saw the long-holed tie plate placed in the mold and put on the steam hammer, and with a "thump," it was hammered into a first-class product, I felt an unparalleled excitement and joy!

    After my suggestion was implemented, many colleagues came to congratulate me. In fact, I was just fulfilling my due responsibility. You see, I am a worker, and when I see materials needed by the country become defective products, how can I not think of a way to solve the problem? Besides, I only came up with the idea; the implementation of the suggestion still relied on the help of everyone! In order to accelerate socialist construction, every one of us workers should use our brains, think of ways, and solve the critical problems in our production.

### 把次品改造成一级合格品

    把次品改造成一级合格品编辑同志：
    1955年6月，我提了一件合理化建议，解决了我们工厂（重庆第三钢铁厂）的一个关键问题。这个建议实现以后，使厂里1，100多吨不合规格的垫板变成了一级合格品，为国家节约66，000多元；而更重要的是，从1955年7月份起，保证了轧钢车间一级品的产品超过国家的指标，扭转了过去长期达不到质量指标的局面。
    1955年4月初，从厂里的反浪费展览会上，我看到光是轧钢车间生产的垫板不合格，一年的浪费就达到80多万元。我在那些图表和废品面前停留了很久，心里很激动。第二天，我就到轧钢车间去。只见检验工站在检验台旁边，拿着量具对准垫板的三个眼子一比，“乓”的一声就扔出一块来。我检起几块量了量，这些被当作“长眼”次品扔掉的垫板，眼子只长了20丝左右；国家铁路建设正需要的垫板遭到这样的命运，叫人多么痛心啊！我是个有40年工龄的老锻工，知道在我们锻工的手里，只长20丝左右的垫板眼子是可以改成合格品的。我就建议制造一个模子，把长眼垫板加工成为一级品。
    我的建议得到了厂长、生产科长等的支持和刘勤生、时根宏、梁云成等同志的具体帮助。模具很快制造成功了。当我看到长眼垫板装在模具里放到汽锤上，“乓”的一声，就打成了一级品的时候，我心里真感到无比的兴奋和愉快！
    我这个建议实现以后，很多伙伴都来祝贺我。其实，我不过是尽到了我应尽的责任吧了。你想嘛，我是个工人，看到国家需要的材料成了次品，能不想办法去解决？再说，我只出了个主意，建议的实现还是全靠大伙的帮助呀！为了加速社会主义的建设，我们每个工人都应该动脑筋，想办法，解决我们生产中的关键问题。
