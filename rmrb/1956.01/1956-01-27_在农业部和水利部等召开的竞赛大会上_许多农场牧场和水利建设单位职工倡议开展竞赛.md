In their proposals, they respectively put forward various production increase targets and measures to ensure the realization of these targets. For example, Lutai Farm proposed that this year's 18,000 mu of rice should achieve an average yield of 800 jin per mu, striving for 850 jin. Huangfanqu Farm proposed that the unit area yield of grain crops this year should be increased from 220 jin in 1955 to 400 jin, and the cost should be reduced by 10%; Red Prairie Ranch proposed that this year, 1,500 heads of hybrid dairy cows of the North Manchurian breed should be bred, with a survival rate of 90%, and each dairy cow should produce an average of 3,000 kilograms of milk, an increase of 12% compared with 1955.
