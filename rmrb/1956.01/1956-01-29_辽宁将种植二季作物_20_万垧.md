Liaoning to Plant 200,000 Hectares of Second Season Crops

This year, agricultural production cooperatives in Liaoning Province plan to plant 200,000 hectares (3 million mu) of second season crops, which is expected to increase grain production by 300,000 tons.

Last year, over 100,000 hectares of second season crops in Liaoning Province generally had a bumper harvest. According to surveys in Beizhen, Jin County and other places, the yield per hectare generally reached 10,000 jin. The second season crops sown by the Jian First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Houchuantai Village, Xin Jin County, yielded more than 15,000 jin of grain per hectare (potatoes are also converted into grain for calculation), which is more than double the yield of single-cropped corn.

    辽宁将种植二季作物20万垧
    辽宁省各地农业生产合作社今年计划种植二季作物20万垧（合300万亩），预计可增产粮食30万吨。
    去年辽宁省十多万垧二季作物普遍丰收。据北镇、锦县等地调查，每垧产量一般都达到万斤。新金县后元台村民建第一农业生产合作社播种的二季作物，每垧产粮15，000多斤（马铃薯也折粮计算），比单种玉米增产一倍多。　　（辽宁日报编辑部）
