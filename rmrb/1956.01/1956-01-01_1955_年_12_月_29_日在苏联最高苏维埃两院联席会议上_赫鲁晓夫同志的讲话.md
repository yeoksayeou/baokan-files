Comrades of the Supreme Soviet!

We have heard the report by Comrade Nikolai Aleksandrovich Bulganin on the results of our visit to three friendly countries—India, Burma, and Afghanistan. This report reflects the main points that must be reported to the Supreme Soviet, namely: the results of our visit and the negotiations we conducted on behalf of the Soviet government in these countries, as well as the agreements reached between the Soviet government and the governments of India, Burma, and Afghanistan.

I fully agree with all the points in Comrade Bulganin's report. I would also like to speak on some issues.

The Soviet government gladly accepted the invitation of Indian Prime Minister Nehru to visit India as a friendly return visit, in order to establish personal contacts with the leaders and people of India. There are many commonalities that unite our two countries, and the most important of these is the struggle to strengthen world peace.

I believe there is no need to discuss the importance of the Indian Republic. The great Indian people are determined to strengthen their already achieved national and political independence. As a peace-loving country, India is playing an increasingly significant role in solving many extremely important international issues. It is actively striving to maintain and strengthen world peace. The various peoples of India, who have freed themselves from colonial rule, are tenaciously seeking their own path of national development. Under the leadership of the outstanding statesman and politician, the respected Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the government of the Indian Republic has consistently pursued a policy of non-reliance on other countries. This is worthy of deep respect.

Close ties and practical cooperation between our two countries are beneficial to both sides.

We also accepted the invitations from the governments of Burma and Afghanistan to visit these two countries with the same considerations.

We know that our visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan will cause some displeasure among certain colonialists, as they fear that the strengthening of friendship between the Soviet Union and countries that were recently under their rule will further weaken the position of the colonial powers.

But the colonial masters should only blame themselves.

Everyone knows that the principles of cooperation and friendship between the Soviet Union and other countries are fundamentally different from those principles that serve as the basis for colonial policy. The Soviet Union has set an example of deeply understanding and respecting the interests of all nations and all countries (regardless of size), and it does so based on the principle that all nations are equal and there are no inferior nations.

When the Soviet Union strengthens its friendship with other countries, it does not impose its will on them, nor does it, like the imperialist countries, set any preconditions. It does not seek any special benefits for itself. Its starting point is that dealing with an equal partner, the interests of the other party should be respected.

Every nation has the right to build its own life according to its own wishes. The enslavement or plunder of one country by another is the greatest injustice and disgrace.

Equality of all nations, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, non-aggression, and peaceful coexistence regardless of the political systems of countries—these are the principles on which our relations with other countries are based. We strictly adhere to these principles, and our increasingly close cooperation with Asian countries forces the colonialists to change their strategies towards these countries (they are trying to maintain their positions in these countries), and improves the situation of these countries.

And this is an important factor.

We also noted that our visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan will not only help bring the leaders of these countries closer together but also help bring the peoples closer. The peoples of India, Burma, and Afghanistan will have more opportunities to learn about the Soviet Union and the life of the Soviet people. This will help strengthen our friendly ties. Finally, we firmly believe that our visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan will further strengthen world peace and weaken the camp of war supporters. Even for this reason alone, our visit is very necessary. Because the cause of peace is a great cause that reflects the greatest wishes of all humanity.

Now we can say that the great hopes placed in our visit have been fully realized.

(Prolonged applause)

Comrades of the Supreme Soviet!

I do not intend to speak about the impressions of our visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan, as this would take a lot of time. I only want to say that these impressions are extremely strong and moving. They are unforgettable, and the strongest impression is the impression of meeting the people.

We had expected to receive a warm welcome from the leaders and people of India. However, upon arriving there, we immediately felt that everything exceeded our expectations.

In the capital of the Indian Republic, Delhi, and in other provinces and cities of India, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of people came to welcome us. And this was a particularly sincere welcome, in which the love of the Indian people for the Soviet people was expressed.

Wherever we went, we were always surrounded by friends who cheered for the eternal and unbreakable friendship between India and the Soviet Union. Just as in a harmonious family welcoming a beloved brother, in the great family of the Indian people, we, the messengers of the great Soviet people, were welcomed with warmth and joy. (Prolonged applause)

The people of Burma, Prime Minister U Nu, and other leaders of the Burmese Federation also gave us such sincere hospitality. In Afghanistan, we were also received with such warmth by the people, Prime Minister Muhammad Daoud Khan, and other leaders of Afghanistan.

Of course, we do not think that the jubilation and expressions of love for us by the peoples of India, Burma, and Afghanistan are directed at us personally.

We consider this to be an expression of the boundless love and respect of the peoples of India, Burma, and Afghanistan for the Soviet people.

We consider this to be a sincere recognition by the peoples of India, Burma, and Afghanistan of the historical merits of the Soviet people in the struggle for world peace and for the bright future of all humanity. (Stormy applause)

During our stay in India, Burma, and Afghanistan, we had extensive discussions with the governments of these countries on many of the most important issues in international politics. Everywhere, we reached a common understanding on all the issues discussed, and we quickly found mutually acceptable solutions to these issues and agreed on the appropriate wording for joint statements and agreements.

In India, it was like this; in Burma, it was like this; in Afghanistan, it was also like this, which made us very happy.

Isn't this proof that despite the different social systems of the countries, as long as the leaders of the countries have goodwill and sincere intentions, it is possible and necessary to solve all problems in international relations through peaceful means?

Everyone knows that there are now such common problems, the solution of which is uncontroversial and acceptable to everyone, regardless of whether the people live in capitalist or socialist countries, all people are equally concerned about the solution of these problems. We can successfully cooperate in solving these problems.

Perhaps the mutual relations between the Soviet Union and India are the most vivid and convincing example of this situation. The social and state systems of the Soviet Union and India are different, and we and the Indian leaders have different views on many issues. Neither we nor our friends, the leaders of the Indian state, hide this. However, this does not prevent us and our Indian friends from adhering to the five principles of peaceful coexistence as the basis of our mutual relations with other countries, maintaining and developing friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India. Our sincere and friendly relations are constantly strengthening and developing.

Our mutual relations with the Burmese Federation and with our old friends and good neighbors Afghanistan are also developing in this direction.

As a result of our visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan, mutually beneficial economic agreements were concluded between the Soviet Union and these countries, in accordance with the interests of the Soviet Union, India, Burma, and Afghanistan.

We consider the Indian Republic, the Burmese Federation, and Afghanistan to be equal partners in the struggle for world peace. There are no differences of opinion between us and the leaders of the countries we visited on the issue of the struggle for peace. And these are major issues that all humanity is closely concerned about.

Our visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan, as well as the results of the Soviet-Indian, Soviet-Burmese, and Soviet-Afghan talks, made a good impression on all friends in the world.

However, our visit was met with unfriendly treatment, even open hostility, by certain individuals, including officials, in some countries, and we were subjected to malicious attacks.

This was mainly in Britain and the United States. There were also such echoes, or rather, following the lead, in other countries, for example, in Canada, Foreign Minister Pearson made a shortsighted statement.

Why is this so?

They accuse us, lecture us, and influence us in other ways because, in their view, our words against the colonialists are incorrect, because we sharply criticized the system of oppression and enslavement of the peoples of colonies and dependent countries by imperialists.

What new things have we said about colonialists and colonialism that have aroused such anger from the colonialists and their defenders? We have said what everyone knows and is indisputable.

For example, British colonialists—not the people, but the colonialists!—ruled India for nearly two hundred years, they long oppressed the peoples of Burma and Afghanistan, this is a fact.

What was the result?

I can quote the words of the authority on this issue, the respected Prime Minister of the Indian Republic, Jawaharlal Nehru.

In his book "The Discovery of India," he emphasizes, "The most obvious fact is: British rule in India has achieved nothing; it has destroyed Indian life." Nehru writes, "Foreign rule inevitably isolates itself from the creative power of the people it rules. When the economic and cultural center of this foreign rule is far from the enslaved country and when it relies on racism, this isolation is complete and plunges the enslaved people into spiritual and cultural poverty."

When explaining the consequences of British rule in India, Nehru mentioned the horrifying famine that occurred nationwide during World War II. He wrote:

"This famine...revealed a picture of poverty, ugliness, and human degradation in these years of British rule. This was the peak and ultimate result of British rule in India. This famine was not caused by natural disasters or the actions of natural forces, nor was it caused by actual war operations or enemy blockades. Every authoritative observer considered it man-made, it was foreseeable and avoidable."

Here we can add: According to the statistics of the Indian economist, the author of the book "The Food Problem of India," Singh, in the last 25 years of the 19th century alone, India suffered 18 famines, and in this period, 26 million people died of hunger. In the 20th century, the scope of famines expanded. In 1943 alone, India had 3.5 million people die of hunger.

The facts are like this. These facts are unfavorable to the colonialists.

The fate of the Burmese people, who also suffered under British colonial rule, was also so tragic. As early as 1824, Britain began to invade Burma by force, and in 1885, it completely occupied the country. The governor of Burma was a British appointee with unlimited power.

During World War II, Burma was occupied by Japan. After Japan's surrender in 1945, the British colonial authorities returned to Burma, attempting to reestablish their rule. However, the patriotic forces of Burma, which had grown strong in the struggle against Japanese occupation, put up a determined resistance. In January 1948, the British imperialists were forced to grant independence to Burma.

The peoples of India, as well as Burma and Afghanistan, did not invite the colonialists to plunder their countries. The colonialists established their rule over these countries through aggression and plundering wars. When the colonialists invaded India and Burma, the territories of India and Burma were not barren lands; the peoples living in these countries had their own high culture. For example, the culture of the Indian people, in terms of its level, everyone knows, is not inferior to that of European countries, including Britain. However, India was a militarily weak country, its arms were inferior. It was only for this reason that it became prey to the colonialists.

Now some supporters of the colonial system say:

"Don't you see that we gave India freedom voluntarily?"

And this explanation, to put it mildly, is a very forced explanation of how and why the colonialists left India and agreed to the existence of the independent Indian Republic.

They had to agree to this because they had no other way out. If they still wanted to stay in India, they would suffer great losses, and in the end, they would still be driven out by the Indian people, just as the various colonialists in China, along with the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, were driven out by the Chinese people. (Stormy applause)

Colonialists sometimes also like to say that they have played a great historical role in spreading civilization. Such words can only deceive fools or those who are ignorant of history and very gullible.

Did the British colonialists really raise the cultural level of the people of the countries they plundered, help these countries establish their own industries, develop science, and improve the welfare of the people? No, they were outright bandits. They plundered these countries and greatly hindered their development. I remember that when we visited a dairy farm in Bombay, the Chief Minister of Bombay Province, Mr. Desai, complained:

"During the days of British rule, everything was destroyed. In these two hundred years, we almost became savages."

The peoples of India, Burma, and other countries that were once ruled by colonialists need to make a lot of effort to eliminate the bad consequences left by the rule of the colonialists.

The fact is that not long ago, more than 80% of the residents of India and 63% of the residents of Burma were illiterate.

The fact is that the living standards of Indian residents were much lower than those of British residents, and the exploitation of India indeed enriched British capitalists. This situation can also be seen in Burma and other countries that were long ruled by colonialists.

Supporters of the colonial system tell us, sorry, these countries are all members of the Commonwealth, they are almost on an equal footing with Britain. But where is this equality? We do not see even a trace of this equality. We see that the British colonialists built beautiful palaces for themselves during their rule in India and Burma.

They took care of a small group of feudal lords who went over to their side, supported those people. But hundreds of millions of Indian people were in a position without rights, suffering extremely cruel exploitation. Indian people, of course, could not tolerate such a situation. Indian people, led by outstanding figures such as Gandhi and Nehru, played a huge role in the struggle to obtain India's political independence. And we, of course, sympathize with their struggle, are happy about their success, and give due appreciation to their courage in this struggle. (Prolonged applause)

Now some people say to us that we are opposed to colonialists, we expose their plundering policies, this is to show some hostile feelings towards Britain and other countries, although we have not specified these other countries, we have not often specified Britain. (The hall is lively) But we do not intend to play hide-and-seek. We and the whole world know who the colonialists were in India, Burma, and Afghanistan.

Yes, when we talk about the unseemly role of the colonialists, we are referring to the British colonialists. But the colonialists are not the whole of Britain, nor are they its people. British colonialists have never had the right to confuse themselves with the British people.

There is not a single word in our speech that insults Britain or the British people. We highly respect the industrious and hardworking British people and hope to be friends with them. (Prolonged applause)

We have not said anything insulting or embarrassing to the British government. But we have always and will continue to condemn the colonial system and believe that the sooner the colonial system ends, the better, because it is a very unreasonable and anti-human system. The sooner the colonial countries break free from it, the better. We are the most sincere friends of those who oppose colonial slavery and colonial dependence. (Applause) We will be happy and celebrate the demise of the colonial system. I believe that the majority of the British people will also welcome this. (Applause)

The era when colonialists ran rampant in colonies and dependent countries has passed. But the colonialists themselves, of course, do not want to voluntarily give up the system that gives them the opportunity to plunder entire countries. One cannot expect this.

We want to express our sympathy and solidarity with our words and actions to the peoples of various countries who have not yet shaken off colonial oppression. (Prolonged applause)

We understand that the colonialists are angry with us not because our speeches condemned the past activities of the colonialists in India and Burma.

They are trying to defend the activities of their own ancestors who once oppressed the peoples of colonies and dependent countries, in order to maintain the positions of the still powerful colonialists. Because the colonialists still have many colonies.

Take Africa, for example. The whole of Africa has been divided up by European countries and countries outside Europe. Now there are various forms and methods of implementing colonial policy, but the chains of colonial slavery have not been loosened because of this. These chains suffocate the peoples of colonies and dependent countries and arouse their hatred of the colonialists.

The peoples of these countries are becoming more and more determined to rise up against the colonial system. We sympathize with this struggle and wish the peoples who are waging this struggle to be victorious. (Stormy applause)

It is truly strange that some shortsighted people blame us for being unfriendly to Britain or the United States, saying that we seem to want to cause these countries to quarrel with India, Burma, and other countries. In fact, they themselves are doing things that are unfriendly to these countries.

For example, what attitude can Indian people have towards the statements made by Mr. Dulles and Portuguese Foreign Minister Cunha on the issue of Goa?

Just think about what Dulles said, he actually said that the Indian territory of Goa should belong to Portugal just because the Portuguese conquerors plundered this land 400 years ago.

Indian newspapers rightly reminded Mr. Dulles of this point: 250 years ago, the present United States was a British colony, if one follows his logic, then he, Dulles, should now consider himself a subject of Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain. (Laughter and applause in the hall)

Agreeing with Mr. Dulles' statement would mean not only praising the system of colonial oppression but also wanting it to last forever.

Of course, we cannot agree with this. We believe that this is an incorrect statement, made due to an incorrect attitude towards the interests of the people. The Indian people and the Indian leadership also rightly evaluated the joint statement of Dulles and Cunha on Goa, which is a disgrace to civilized countries.

Taking this opportunity, let me say a few words about another issue that the Indian people are exceptionally concerned about, namely the so-called Kashmir issue. Comrade Nikolai Aleksandrovich Bulganin and I already clearly stated our attitude towards this issue when we visited Kashmir. This issue is not one that arose from the people, but one that was artificially stirred up by certain countries that seek to sow hatred among the people.

In Kashmir, we saw that the people of Kashmir regard their territory as an indivisible part of the Indian Republic. The people of Kashmir have irrevocably solved this issue, and we also deeply believe that the people of Kashmir will ultimately be able to handle their own affairs without external interference, regardless of whether those who want to create unrest and international friction in Kashmir like it or not. (Applause)

The Soviet people understand and sympathize with the Indian people and the Indian government's concern for strengthening their own country and for satisfying the reasonable wishes of the various nationalities within the Indian Republic, just as we understand and sympathize with the wishes of the peoples of various countries who are struggling for their national independence.

In our speeches in India and Burma, we said that our country is both a European country and an Asian country, and a considerable part of its territory is on the Asian continent. At the same time, we emphasized that the peoples of the Soviet Union—regardless of whether they live in the European part of the country or the Asian part, regardless of their skin color and religious beliefs—form a united family of peoples, this family is strong and powerful due to unbreakable friendship. Our peoples are united under the great goal of building communism. (Stormy applause)

The Soviet Union is a great multi-ethnic country composed of sixteen equal, voluntary union republics. The entire power of our country belongs to the laborers of the Soviet society—the working class, laboring peasants, and intellectuals.

We have always opposed national oppression and any form of human exploitation, especially the rule of colonialists who have brought countless disasters to humanity. In our speeches in India and Burma, we once again spoke very directly and frankly about this, and emphasized that the colonial system is an anti-people and very unreasonable system.

Why are the colonialists so panicked now?

They are panicked because our words have resonated widely among the masses. This is not only in the places where we have spoken, but also in the places where our words have been heard, and in the places where the unshakable position of the Soviet Union in condemning the colonial system of oppression and enslavement of the peoples of various countries will be heard not just once. (Stormy applause)

This is the truth, and imperialists cannot stop these words with any iron curtain.

It should be noted that not only those who oppose colonialism, but also those who do not oppose the colonial system, condemn Dulles' position. Let's take a look at a few words spoken by U.S. Senator Kefauver.

He said, "First, the United States should completely abandon old-style colonialism in Asia."

Please note that Mr. Kefauver calls for the abandonment not of all colonialism, but of "old-style" colonialism. (Laughter, the hall is lively)

He hopes that the colonialists will seek new forms of strengthening their colonial rule and advocates "fashionable" colonialism.

Therefore, he calls for: "We should not let our aid be used to support bad governments."

This is a very valuable admission.

Colonialists see how resolutely the people rise up against colonial slavery. They see that the people are determined to make self-sacrificing struggles, to achieve heroic feats, and to fight selflessly for the freedom and national independence of their own countries. The peoples of many countries have already driven out the colonialists.

The struggle of the great Chinese people is an example that inspires all the peoples of colonies and dependent countries. The Chinese people have broken free from the chains of foreign oppression, taken their own destiny into their own hands, and under the glorious leadership of the Communist Party, established a powerful People's Republic of China, and are now building socialism victoriously. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

Now, the colonialists have decided to change the form of their colonial rule. They are using increasingly fewer forms of pressure such as sending their own troops to colonial countries and other rude interventions in the affairs of the enslaved countries.

They are now becoming more cunning: buying people, buying the power of the rich, supporting "good governments," establishing aggressive blocs like the Baghdad Pact.

They offer money for so-called "economic aid," "free" weapons to certain countries. But the countries that receive weapons must provide cannon fodder for the colonialists, build large armies, and exhaust their own people as the price for obtaining these weapons.

Colonialists give a gold coin under the pretext of "aid," but this is to gain ten gold coins by exploiting the people who accept this "aid" in the future. After achieving this goal, they also enslave the people politically, this is the "new" form of colonialist rule.

And this is not only about Asian and African countries or other so-called backward countries. Now, American monopolists are relentlessly infiltrating European countries with these forms of "aid." Now, even the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has a strong smell of this.

Why is the United States so "generous"? Why does it provide military equipment to European countries, including West Germany, which is itself very developed, without asking for money? It pursues the goal of tying not only backward countries but also highly developed countries to itself with golden chains.

We expose this policy, saying that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other similar blocs are organizations with deep political and economic goals.

Some people say that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established because the Soviet Union showed aggressive intentions, so it seems necessary to establish a super-powerful combined army of the member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to counter the Soviet Union and the socialist countries.

It is not difficult to understand who needs to spread such lies and for what purpose. People spread such lies to make the masses not pay attention to the changes taking place in the countries that are increasingly dependent on American monopolists.

However, the artificially created illusions are now beginning to collapse, and people are beginning to distinguish between truth and deception.

People are beginning to talk like this: if the Soviet Union really wanted to open the way for new social systems in other countries through war, then it would have done so long ago.

Indeed, at the end of the war, the strongest force was the Soviet Union, who doesn't know this? At that time, nothing prevented the Soviet Union from advancing its fully mobilized army and occupying the whole of Europe. However, this did not happen, and it could not happen.

Everyone is very familiar with the following theory of Marxism-Leninism: revolution cannot be exported, revolution must be accomplished by the people themselves who are struggling for their own liberation. Soviet people were, are, and will always follow the policy of peaceful coexistence and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, as indicated by the great Lenin. (Prolonged applause)

Why, after the end of the war, did some imperialist blocs incite war hysteria and try to frighten the people with the fabricated "Soviet threat"?

They did this for their selfish interests.

Their goal is very clear: imperialists need to do this to be able to enslave the people without punishment and to develop the military industry with huge taxes, this is what the monopolist capitalists who are eager for war care about.

They make huge profits from this. Just mentioning the following fact is enough: American monopolist capital now earns more than twice as much profit from military production as during the war.

According to preliminary data, the profits of American companies in 1955 reached 43 billion dollars, so the monopolist capitalists have money to provide so-called "aid" to the countries that the United States drags into its sphere of influence. In fact, this is not aid, but alms thrown from the table by the master, with harsh conditions attached.

The Soviet Union condemns this policy. Its relations with other countries are based on equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs.

When we provide economic or technical assistance to these or those countries, we do so as friends, without forcing others to accept our conditions.

We do not have surplus capital. We manage our economy according to the plan. We do not care about the export of capital, nor about the export of goods, we produce goods only for the needs of our country and our allies, and to ensure the needs of foreign trade, we have some goods whose production is temporarily insufficient to meet the growing needs of the country.

Even so, we still believe it is our responsibility to share the hardships and joys with our friends and help them brotherly. This assistance, under mutually beneficial conditions, is beneficial to both sides. Our friends know that the selfless help they receive from us comes from our internal funds. And friends will not overlook this, because it shows our sincere intentions.

Under these conditions, the monopolist capitalists had to change tactics. Some more sensible bourgeois figures now say that it is necessary to strengthen economic aid from capitalist countries to backward countries. This is not bad, let the capitalist countries provide such aid. This is much better than dragging these countries into military blocs and alliances.

The aid that capitalist countries plan to provide to countries that have recently gained independence cannot be considered anything other than indirect aid from the Soviet Union to these countries. If it were not for the existence of the Soviet Union, would the monopolist capitalist groups and imperialist countries provide aid to backward countries? Of course not. Such a thing has never happened before. (The hall is lively, applause)

I have already said that according to the capitalist understanding of so-called "free" aid, it can actually lead to the enslavement of the recipients if these countries do not choose carefully.

Not long ago, the former British Foreign Minister Macmillan said in a review of the achievements of the Conservative Party government that this government successfully resolved the affairs with Iran, resulting in a large amount of oil from Abadan flowing into Britain.

And this is the wealth of Iran flowing out. This is the gold flowing from Iran into the vaults of the banks of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and France. And at this time, the people of Iran are suffering from poverty. They are "aiding" Iran on the one hand, and taking Iran's oil without paying a penny on the other, enriching themselves with the hunger and poverty of the Iranian people.

We do not tell the peoples of Asia: do not accept the aid of American and British monopolists. But we sincerely remind them to be careful with this "aid," because monopolist capitalists will not give benefits without compensation.

Capitalists will not do anything without compensation. Without profit, capital cannot exist.

Comrades of the Supreme Soviet!

I have already said that this visit to India, the meetings with the Indian national leaders, the meetings with the leaders of the provinces, the meetings with Indian workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and the meetings with all the people we encountered, have left us with the best memories.

We highly value the friendship between us and India and its great, hardworking people, the friendship with Mr. Nehru and the other outstanding figures of India we have met, and we want to maintain and develop our friendly relations.

We and our Indian friends both hope to develop and strengthen this friendly relationship without harming the friendly relations of the two countries with other countries.

This is how we understand our friendship: we should not limit friendly ties to one, two, or several countries. We want to be friends with all countries. Therefore, we are also happy that our friends develop friendly relations with other countries, including those countries whose relations with us are somewhat strained and cold for various reasons. We hope to improve our relations with these countries through our friends, and we consider India to be such a friend.

We have always and will always sincerely hope for friendship with all countries, including capitalist countries. For example, we want to live in friendship with the most powerful capitalist countries—America, Britain, and France. If this can be achieved, it will create conditions for the true peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition of the two systems, and this mainly depends not on us, but on the governments and peoples of America, Britain, and France.

Unfortunately, we have not yet achieved this, but we do not give up hope and will not spare our efforts to work towards this goal. (Applause)

We fully understand and support the position of the Indian leadership, who declare that India takes a neutral position between us and other countries. India is indeed a neutral country, and it deserves our trust and respect from us and other countries.

We have the closest relations with the great People's Republic of China. Our two peoples are brothers.

Title: Speech by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev at the Supreme Soviet
Author: 赫鲁晓夫
Date: 1956-01-31

Tass News Agency, Moscow, January 31st

Our friendly and good relations with the Republic of India have been established and are continually strengthening. In any part of India, we hear from the people's hearts the words: "Indo-Russian Brotherhood!" ("Indians and Russians are brothers!") (Stormy applause)

And the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of India together make up half of humanity, forming a powerful force for the maintenance and consolidation of world peace. (Stormy applause)

Comrades, representatives!

Some foreign elements and extremely irresponsible bourgeois journalists, in discussing the results of our visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan and in analyzing our speeches in these countries, accuse the Soviet Union of abandoning the "Geneva spirit." This is incorrect.

We made a significant contribution to the easing of international tensions at the Geneva Summit of the Four Powers. At the summit of the heads of government and at the conference of foreign ministers, which was tasked with discussing the issues of ensuring European security and related problems of Germany, disarmament, and the development of East-West contacts, we worked towards the easing of international tensions.

The results sought by the peace-loving peoples of the world, who are striving for the easing of international tensions and the consolidation of peace, have not yet been achieved, and this is not our fault.

The Geneva Summit of the Four Powers and the conference of foreign ministers, especially the summit of the heads of government, were warmly welcomed by the peoples of the world. The desire of the peoples of the world for the easing of international tensions and the consolidation of peace forced the participants in these meetings to formulate their speeches and proposals accordingly. Unfortunately, it must be admitted that the representatives of the Western countries at the summit of the heads of government confined themselves to saying pleasant things about the easing of international tensions. Their foreign ministers, in particular, were unwilling to make a genuine effort and strive to achieve the goals set by the summit of the heads of government. This shows that the governments of the Western countries that sent their high-level representatives to the summit of the Four Powers had no desire to solve the issues listed on the agenda of the meeting. They attended the meeting as a concession to public opinion pressure.

The very fact of convening the summit of the Four Powers, the speeches made there, and the program of action set by the heads of government for their foreign ministers—all this, of course, contributed to the easing of international tensions and gave rise to the hope of taking certain more concrete measures to prevent military conflicts and eliminate the "Cold War."

Thus, the "Geneva spirit" was born.

The peoples of the world welcomed it because they desired peace, a reduction in taxes and military expenditures, and the use of this large sum of money to improve the living standards of the population. These are the concrete desires of the peoples of the world.

But what the peoples like and what they desire is precisely what the capitalists who manufacture atomic, hydrogen, and other weapons do not like. The prospect of reducing armaments, especially disarmament, appears to the monopolists as a prospect of reducing profits, which they cannot agree to under any circumstances.

This is why, immediately after the conclusion of the summit of the Four Powers, those who produce weapons of destruction and those who occupy leading positions in capitalist countries and carry out the will of such people, not only did not intend to deepen and expand the "Geneva spirit," but, on the contrary, tried to strangle it in its infancy.

As for the Soviet Union, its representatives at the summit of the Four Powers and the conference of foreign ministers exerted all their efforts to achieve a successful outcome.

Unfortunately, our efforts were not met with similar efforts on the part of the other side, and the problems of concern to all mankind were not resolved.

We will spare no effort to ensure that these problems are ultimately resolved successfully. However, to achieve this, our efforts alone are not enough. The efforts of our opponents are also needed.

Finally, the force of the opinion of millions of people is needed, a force that advocates for ensuring security, disarmament, easing international tensions, and stopping the "Cold War."

The most acute problem today is the problem of ensuring European security. The solution of other international problems depends on the solution of this problem. However, you know that our negotiating partners—America, Britain, and France—use the German problem to counter this problem.

Their position is to annex the German Democratic Republic to West Germany, abolish the social achievements of the working people of the German Democratic Republic, and arm to the teeth this unified and NATO-member Germany. Under these conditions, they would not object to signing the "European Security" treaty, but in fact, this would not only fail to ensure European security but, on the contrary, would greatly increase the threat of a new war in Europe and, consequently, all the serious consequences of war for the peoples of the world.

The defenders of this position do not hide the fact that the sole purpose of planning such a military union is to strengthen the camp of NATO member countries, to create an advantage for this camp, so as to force the Soviet Union and the people's democracies to surrender to them and accept their conditions.

What a fine "security"!

Every sensible person will understand that such a plan cannot be realized. If one genuinely wants to solve the problem of ensuring European security, one must take a serious attitude and consider the real situation.

The distinctive feature of this real situation is, first of all, that there are now two states with different political and social systems on the territory of Germany, one of which—the German Democratic Republic—is fighting for the strengthening of peace and democracy. While the other state—the Federal Republic of Germany—is a faithful follower of the policy of "positions of strength," and the Federal Republic of Germany is a member of the aggressive NATO bloc.

What does this mean? This means that under the current conditions, there is no real possibility of reunifying the two completely different Germanys. But does this mean that it is now impossible to ensure collective European security, which would help to ensure world peace? No, it does not.

Whether it is Britain or the Soviet Union, France or Poland, Czechoslovakia or Belgium—all European countries, as well as the United States, are concerned about ensuring European security and creating conditions for consolidating peace.

If one genuinely proceeds from this position and considers that the two Germanys, which have joined mutually opposed state groups, can successfully participate in a pan-European security system (which would replace the aforementioned two groups), then the problem can be solved in a way that is in the interests of the peoples.

We see no other solution. No one can force us to use our own hands to strengthen the military bloc that is hostile to the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries. (Applause)

Those who want us to agree to such a method of German unification, that is, one that would make the unified Germany join the aggressive anti-Soviet bloc, are precisely those who want to achieve this goal.

We hope that the Germans, especially the Germans of West Germany, will be able to understand this problem correctly. The peoples of the Soviet Union, Germany, and the European people's democracies have been involved in two bloody world wars, and the greatest losses in these wars were suffered by our people and the German people. Now is the time to consider this situation and find the correct solution to avoid repeating such tragedies in the future.

As for our relations with West Germany, we have not once declared that it is appropriate, in the interests of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, to establish good friendly relations between us. There are all the conditions for this.

I would like to point out that our efforts to ensure pan-European security and, accordingly, to solve the German problem do not violate the interests of Britain and France, but, on the contrary, if the completely unrealistic dream of the American warmongers about drawing the unified Germany into the aggressive bloc is realized, in such a case, the French and British would not necessarily live peacefully. Then, the German revanchists would have no restraints and could act at will, and France would naturally become an appetizing morsel in their eyes.

We say this not because we hope for such a thing to happen. No, we will do everything in our power to prevent this from happening. But historical experience tells us that such a danger exists, and because France is weaker than the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, and Britain is also weaker, this danger is even greater.

Therefore, we sincerely hope that France and Britain will also be able to understand us correctly. Would it not be better if we did not expend our strength on preparing for mutual opposition but instead worked together to find the correct solution to the problem of European security? (Prolonged applause)

In this connection, I would like to mention that the proposals made by French Prime Minister Faure and British Prime Minister Eden in Geneva provided a basis for negotiations on ensuring European security.

If this problem could be resolved, it would promote the resolution of other extremely important problems, including the problem of disarmament.

Everyone knows that at both Geneva conferences and in the United Nations, the Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed a series of specific proposals on the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the establishment of international supervision. The change in the position of the United States prevented an agreement on these issues, as the United States, when we agreed to take their proposals as a basis, suddenly overturned their own previous proposals.

At present, the United States has essentially canceled the issue of reducing armaments and has placed the only proposal made by President Eisenhower in Geneva—on the exchange of military information and on unobstructed aerial photography—in the forefront.

We have already pointed out that the proposal on aerial photography does not solve the essence of the problem. In fact, without regulating armaments and even planning to expand them, flying over the territory and conducting aerial photography can only fuel belligerent desires and war hysteria. So, this is not supervision, and there is not even a hint of supervision. In essence, this is just a means of reconnaissance to determine the strength of other countries.

Is it not clear that the information obtained in this way can be used to choose the most convenient moment to launch a sudden attack on this country? Tell me, what is the difference between this and so-called military reconnaissance? In essence, there is no difference.

The following attitude is another matter, that is, taking a realistic attitude towards the problem of disarmament: advocating for agreements on the level of armaments, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and establishing a reasonable system of international supervision over railway junctions, naval bases, airports, etc., under the current conditions, so as to be able to prevent a sudden attack by one country on another. Such measures are completely feasible and would be welcomed by the peoples of the world.

Some opponents of disarmament start from such a false premise: they claim that their strength has some advantage, and therefore disarmament is not in their interest. We have warned in the past and will warn again those who uphold the discredited policy of "positions of strength" that they may make a big mistake in their gambling. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

We do not want to frighten anyone, and we do not want to boast about our current military-technical achievements. However, to cool down the enthusiasm of those who are most eager to expand armaments, we should recall the results of the recent Soviet test of the latest hydrogen bomb.

As announced, the power of this weapon is equivalent to several hundred million tons of conventional explosives, and it can be greatly increased. We continue to advocate for the prohibition of the production, testing, and use of all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons. However, those who oppose this should not forget the results of the aforementioned test. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

The problem of developing East-West contacts, which was discussed at the Geneva conferences, is also of great significance. The Soviet Union has promoted this development in practice. For example, we have not refused to issue visas to foreigners who wish to come to the Soviet Union to study Soviet life, both in the past and now, because we hope to ease international tensions and establish contacts with people from other countries.

This year, many American senators and congressmen have come to our country, and we are happy to receive them and talk to them.

Many reactionary American newspaper reporters have freely traveled in the Soviet Union, and these people are skilled at writing the most absurd anti-Soviet articles. We know this, but we still let them come to the Soviet Union, although we know that these journalists come here to write works imbued with the spirit of the "Cold War" in the future.

The American authorities have allowed only a small number of agricultural delegations, construction worker delegations, and a single group of Soviet journalists to go to the United States, and by the way, this group of journalists waited for visas for nine months. Some of them even had children during this time. (The hall is lively. Applause)

We are willing to strengthen contacts between Soviet people and various people from the United States and other countries. We are willing to strengthen mutual friendship, but we do not want, as some people proposed in Geneva, for other countries to interfere in Soviet internal affairs, of course, we will not agree to this.

It cannot be overlooked that some Western politicians have recently given a rather strange interpretation of the "Geneva spirit." They hope that the Soviet Union will unilaterally reduce its troops, and that we will also disarm morally, spiritually, and ideologically.

Such arguments are nothing new; such talk is not the first year. Although life has repeatedly severely taught those who tried to impose such conditions on the Soviet Union.

Some people in the United States are fervently advocating for such an unrealistic policy towards the Soviet Union, and the current U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has taken on the role of an unseemly theorist of such a policy. I say this not to reveal any secrets.

It is he who has long been actively promoting the infamous "rollback," "massive retaliation," and other absurdities.

Some people in the United States seem unwilling to face reality, and in the current conditions, after the Geneva Summit of the Four Powers, they still try to use the words of the long-discredited policy of "positions of strength."

All these arguments about the need to "continue to put pressure on" and "force the communists to retreat" come from here.

In this regard, it is necessary to talk in particular about the attitude of some prominent figures in the United States, including the well-known Eisenhower, who talked about the need to ease international tensions in Geneva, now adopted.

I am referring to President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dulles, and other responsible officials in the United States giving their so-called "Christmas greetings" to the peoples of the people's democracies, which have nothing in common with the "Geneva spirit," and which are nothing more than a crude interference in the internal affairs of sovereign member states of the United Nations.

These American officials said in their "Christmas greetings" that they were "praying" for a change in the existing systems of these countries and openly promised American "support" for this.

Can this prove a desire for reconciliation, prove efforts to consolidate and expand the "Geneva spirit"?

No, this will have the opposite effect; it will provoke emotional outbursts and intensify the arms race and the threat of war.

I do not want to talk about all this, especially about the highly respected Mr. Eisenhower. Someone might say that Khrushchev is talking about these issues to undermine the "Geneva spirit." But in fact, I am not raising these issues myself, but only want to respond to those who are undermining the "Geneva spirit" and openly interfering in our allies and friends—the people's democracies.

When we talk about such obviously political "Christmas greetings," it becomes clear who the authors are. They represent quite large companies. Take, for example, such a respectable representative of this group of people as Mr. Harriman. Everyone knows that he has hundreds of millions of dollars. The capital of the others is not small, whether it is more or less, only heaven knows, we have not counted their money. But if their money is less than Harriman's, they undoubtedly want to have more than he has.

In other words, here it is not a matter of conscience, but of one's own wallet. (Laughter and applause in the hall)

The authors of the "Christmas greetings" advocate changing the systems of the people's democracies, which means supporting the former capitalists and landlords of these countries who were driven out by the working people of the people's democracies. (Prolonged applause)

However, one cannot equate the peoples of these countries with such people as Betsal, Legiville, Pototsky, Bratianu, and others. (Prolonged applause)

The connection of the American authors of the non-religious "Christmas greetings" with the capitalists who were driven out of or fled from the people's democracies is extremely close. These Americans want to change the new systems in the people's democracies, hoping for the restoration of capitalist systems, returning factories to capitalists, and returning land to landlords.

Mr. Harriman not only wants capitalists to return to these countries but also apparently wants to control the economy of Hungary as he did before the establishment of the people's democratic regime in Hungary.

But the restoration is impossible. No matter what kind of "Christmas greetings," whether for landlords, capitalists, bankers, big merchants, and other exploiters who were driven out of the people's democracies by the working people, it will not help. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

We can talk about our own experience. When our people overthrew the capitalist system and established the world's first workers' and peasants' state, there were many defenders of the old capitalist system at home and abroad who fervently prayed for the restoration of the old capitalist system in Russia.

Abroad, there were those who sincerely prayed for Milukov, Terechenko, Yuz, Lyubashensky, and other representatives of big capital, hoping for the restoration of the power of capitalists and landlords. But what was the result?

All attempts by international imperialism to restore the capitalist system in our country failed. The Soviet people, under the leadership of their tried and tested leader, the Communist Party, crushed all those who tried to restore the capitalist system in Russia by force, weapons, or other means.

Our people, full of confidence and unwaveringly, continued to advance along the path of socialist development, realizing the centuries-old dream of the working people, and built the world's first socialist society. They created a powerful socialist industry, and the following figures are sufficient to illustrate the level of development of socialist industry: in 1955, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union increased to 27 times that of 1913, while the production of means of production increased to 60 times, electricity production increased to 86 times, and the production of machine-building products increased to more than 160 times. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

Our agriculture is constantly improving and developing.

Before the revolution, 76% of the population in Russia were illiterate, but as early as before the Second World War, illiteracy in our country had been basically eliminated, and this year, about 35 million students are studying in our primary and secondary schools and vocational schools. Now, 1,865,000 students are studying in institutions of higher education. The number of experts trained by the Soviet Union is much greater than the total of Britain, France, Italy, and other capitalist countries in Western Europe. (Applause)

Even a person like Mr. Churchill, who is very active in opposing communism, not only prayed for the restoration of the capitalist system in our country but also tried to restore it by force in Russia. Now he also has to admit that the Soviet Union has far surpassed the capitalist countries in training experts, and this is not for nothing. This makes Mr. Churchill worried, but we are very happy. (Stormy applause)

The outstanding achievements of our country's development are an example that inspires the working people of all the people's democracies and other countries.

The peoples of the world, including the peoples of colonies and dependent countries, are increasingly resolutely opposing the exploitation of man by man and the oppression of some countries by others.

This cannot but be considered a manifestation of the great power of Marxism-Leninism, which is constantly penetrating into the consciousness of millions of people around the world. The future belongs to this doctrine. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

The working people of all the people's democracies have personally experienced that only by overthrowing the capitalist regime and having the people in power can they obtain true freedom, so they will rally more closely around their Communist, Workers', and Labor Parties to respond to all the machinations of the enemy.

No matter how much the capitalists rage, they cannot split the socialist camp. We will continue to advance along the path indicated by the great Lenin, holding hands tightly together, and eliminate all obstacles that hinder our countries from moving towards the construction of a communist society. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

The most far-sighted and sober-minded British, American, and French people understand that the recent stance of some people in the Western countries is contrary to the "Geneva spirit." For example, Lord Jolliffe recently said that Western countries bear a heavy responsibility for the failure of the Geneva Conference of Foreign Ministers. Jolliffe said, "I must say, in my opinion, the theory that only Western countries are right is untenable." I would like to point out that we have not refuted this. (The hall is lively) He said: "Western countries are actually pursuing what I consider to be an outdated 'policy of strength.' While in the Soviet Union, I believe it has made many significant concessions and pursued a much more flexible policy, thereby gaining an advantage." One cannot but agree with such an assessment. To shift the blame and accuse us of undermining the "Geneva spirit," some bourgeois journalists take my words, the words of other statesmen and politicians of our country as a pretext. They complain that we talk about the inevitable victory of Marxism-Leninism in our speeches. But does this undermine the "Geneva spirit"? Indeed, we have always believed and still believe that in the peaceful competition between the two economic systems, the socialist system will inevitably win because it is the most advanced and progressive system, and it is based on the only correct Marxism-Leninism. (Stormy applause)

If the thinkers of the capitalist world opposite to us say that capitalism will inevitably win, this does not surprise us, and we do not protest. We consider such a debate to be natural, and only history can resolve such a debate.

If some people think that believing in the inevitable victory of socialism and Marxism-Leninism is undermining the "Geneva spirit," then these people obviously have an incorrect understanding of the "Geneva spirit." They should remember that we have never abandoned and will never abandon our ideology, the struggle for the victory of communism. They will never make us abandon our ideological weapons! (Stormy, prolonged applause)

The fact that we believe in the ultimate victory of communism is not surprising and does not trouble us, but we say: in this competition, in this struggle, we will not initiate an aggressive war, and we will tirelessly fight against the expansion of armaments, for disarmament, for strengthening peace, and for peaceful coexistence.

From this, it is clear that the facts convincingly show: the "Geneva spirit" is not being undermined by the Soviet Union, but by our opponents at the Geneva Conference.

Let us give another example. The ink on the joint communiqué on the results of the Geneva Conference had not yet dried when some of our opponents began to attract some countries to join the aggressive Baghdad Pact— they had already drawn Iran into this pact and were trying to draw in other countries.

On the first day of the session of the Supreme Soviet, we attentively listened to the speech of the head of the Iranian parliamentary delegation, Mr. Sayyid, who said that the Iranian people want peace and friendship with the Soviet Union.

We welcome this speech, but we cannot fail to point out that despite the efforts of the Soviet Union to ensure friendly relations with Iran, the Iranian government has joined the Baghdad military bloc, thereby placing its territory under the control of aggressive forces plotting an attack on the Soviet Union.

Not only Iran, but also Turkey is doing the same. Everyone knows that when Kemal and Inonu led Turkey, we had very good relations with Turkey, but later these relations faded. We cannot say that this is entirely the fault of Turkey; we also made inappropriate statements that led to the fading of these relations.

However, after that, we took measures on our part to change this situation and restore friendly relations with Turkey.

Unfortunately, we did not receive corresponding measures from the Turkish state leadership.

American military leaders visited Turkey, and they made belligerent statements, demonstrating their strength with visits by warships.

The governments of Iran and Turkey have tied their fate to the aggressive Baghdad Pact, refusing to establish good-neighborly relations with the Soviet Union, which is not necessarily wise.

The attitude of Pakistan towards its neighbors is also similar; it is also a participant in the Baghdad Pact. It is a fact that Pakistan's relations with India, Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union need to be greatly improved.

One cannot but remind everyone of the fact that Admiral Radford of the U.S. Navy recently visited Pakistan and then visited Iran. He went to these countries, obviously not to strengthen economic and cultural ties, but for entirely different purposes.

The visit of the U.S. Navy admiral confirms the previously expressed concerns: Pakistan and Iran, despite their national interests, are being drawn deeper into the intrigues of the aggressor organizations. There can be no doubt that if Pakistan were to take, for example, an independent position like India, it would create conditions for establishing friendly relations between Pakistan and its neighbors.

We believe that the Pakistani people will understand the shameful position in which their country has found itself and will draw the necessary conclusions. We are willing to establish friendly relations with Pakistan on our part.

Since we are talking about the Baghdad Pact, we must talk about the situation in the Near and Middle Eastern countries. Everyone knows that the organizers of the Baghdad Pact are desperately trying to drag the Arab countries into this aggressive bloc. However, they have encountered increasingly strong resistance from the peoples of these countries.

The Soviet public has always sympathetically watched the heroic struggle of the people of countries like Jordan, who are fighting against the attempt to forcibly drag Jordan into the Baghdad Pact.

We understand the desire of the Arab peoples to completely get rid of foreign dependence. On the other hand, the actions of the State of Israel are condemnable, as this state has threatened its neighbors from the moment of its establishment and pursued an unfriendly policy towards them.

Obviously, such a policy is not in the national interests of the State of Israel, and obviously, some well-known imperialist countries are backing those who carry out this policy. These imperialist countries want to use Israel as a tool against the Arab peoples to plunder the natural wealth of this region greedily.

Western countries continue to pursue a policy of an arms race and the formation of aggressive blocs, while the Soviet Union consistently and firmly pursues its peaceful foreign policy, strengthening friendship with all peoples who want to be friends with us, to consolidate peace and security.

Just in this year, the Soviet Union has reduced its armed forces by 640,000 people, abandoned its military base in the Finnish Porkala Peninsula, and prematurely withdrew its troops from Port Arthur. The Soviet Union concluded the Austrian State Treaty, which put this country on the path of permanent neutrality, and withdrew its troops from Austrian territory, established diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, and took a series of other equally effective measures to consolidate peace.

The Soviet Union has restored friendly relations with Yugoslavia, and our mutual relations had been in an abnormal and tense state for a long time. We will continue to develop our friendly neighborly relations with Yugoslavia in the future and expand economic and cultural ties between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. (Prolonged applause)

An important position in these measures is occupied by our visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan, as well as the agreements reached between the Soviet Union and these countries.

At this session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, when discussing the state budget for 1956, we all unanimously voted to reduce the expenditure for defense needs by nearly one billion rubles compared to the previous year.

While the U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson recently announced that in the new budget year, the expenditure for maintaining the U.S. armed forces would increase by another ten billion dollars, reaching the enormous figure of three hundred and fifty-five billion dollars. Wilson did not mention that, in addition to this, the budget also provides a considerable sum of money for other military expenditures, such as the production of atomic weapons, the stockpiling of strategic materials, and military "aid" to foreign countries.

Therefore, if there are specific examples on our part aimed at easing international tensions, then, unfortunately, we do not see such a situation on the other side, that is, in the Western countries. On the contrary, the United States is increasing military expenditures. The leaders of this country are expanding aggressive pacts, and some of them make belligerent statements that are not at all aimed at strengthening the "Geneva spirit."

So, who is strengthening the Geneva spirit, and who is undermining it?

Finally, I would like to talk about the issue of the continued existence of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau—known as Cominform in the West.

In fact, there is no reason to raise such a question. However, foreign journalists in India constantly ask us:

Why don't you dissolve Cominform? Can you stop the activities of the Communist Party in other countries?

Other interlocutors also ask us such questions.

We tell these people:

Why don't you propose dissolving the Socialist International? Why don't you propose dissolving the various international alliances of capitalists?

Thus, our interlocutors have nothing to say in response.

Of course, the enemies of communism do not like Cominform. However, one must know that scientific communism as a doctrine has existed for about a hundred years before the establishment of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau. Cooperation within the framework of Cominform is an internal matter of the Communist and Workers' Parties that advocate Marxism-Leninism and propagate a certain social system. The Communist Party represents the working class, expresses and defends the interests of the working class, and the vital interests of the masses.

The enemies of communism do not like not only Cominform. They dislike even more the unshakable fact that the invincible doctrine of communism is attracting more and more people from all over the world to its banner every year. (Prolonged applause)

The Soviet people remember that in the past, the Social Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and other enemies of the working class used to say that they supported the Soviet government, but they supported it without the Bolsheviks. These parties tried to deceive the people with such slogans, to separate the people from their leader—the great Lenin, who founded the Communist Party. They knew that the government could be changed, but the Communist Party could not be changed. It is impossible to force the Communist Party to abandon the defense of the interests of the working class, the interests of the people, because the Communist Party is the true leader of the working class and the peasantry, the leader of the people, and the representative of the vital interests of the people. (Stormy applause)

All the Communist Parties of the world follow the example of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, closely linking all their activities with the vital interests of the working class, the interests of the people. This is what all those who want to oppress the people forever do not like. They do not like the international unity of the working class, and therefore, they naturally want Cominform to cease to exist, but this cannot be achieved by their decision. (Stormy applause)

The above are the issues that I think it is necessary to discuss in more detail.

Finally, I believe that the Supreme Soviet will approve the results of our visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan, as this visit has helped to consolidate the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet people and the peoples of India, Burma, and Afghanistan. The friendship of the peoples of the world is precisely the powerful source of the strength of the peoples of the world to prevent another war. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

Comrades, representatives, allow me to once again, from this high rostrum, express our heartfelt thanks to the great Indian people, the government of the Republic of India, and Prime Minister Nehru himself, (Stormy applause) to the friendly people of the Union of Burma, their government, and Prime Minister U Nu himself, (Stormy applause) and to the friendly people of Afghanistan, their government, and Prime Minister Muhammad Daoud Khan himself. (Stormy applause)

We sincerely thank the millions of people of these countries who showed us such warm hospitality, care, and affection during our visit to India, Burma, and Afghanistan. (Stormy applause) We sincerely thank the politicians and social activists we met, and the heads of the provinces and states we visited, because we received the most sincere and enthusiastic reception everywhere we went. (Stormy applause)

Long live the great friendship of the peoples of the world! (Stormy, prolonged applause)

Long live the strong and fearless fighter for peace, the Soviet people! (Stormy, prolonged applause)

Long live the great Soviet Communist Party, the inspirer and organizer of all the victories of the Soviet Union! (Stormy, prolonged applause, everyone stands)

### 1955年12月29日在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上　赫鲁晓夫同志的讲话

专栏：

    1955年12月29日在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上
　　赫鲁晓夫同志的讲话
　　代表同志们！
    我们听了尼古拉·亚历山德罗维奇·布尔加宁同志关于我们访问三个友好国家——印度、缅甸和阿富汗的结果的报告。这个报告反映了必须向最高苏维埃报告的主要的东西，这就是关于：我们的访问的结果和我们受苏联政府的委托在这些国家进行的谈判以及关于苏联政府同印度、缅甸和阿富汗三国政府之间达成的协议。
    我完全同意布尔加宁同志的报告中的各点。我也想就一些问题谈一谈。
    苏联政府欣然接受了印度总理尼赫鲁先生的邀请，并且派遣我们前往印度作友好的酬答访问，以便同印度的领导人和人民建立个人的接触。有许多共同的东西使我们两国团结起来，而主要的东西是争取巩固世界和平的斗争。
    我认为，无需要谈印度共和国的重要性。伟大的印度人民决心巩固他们已经取得的自己国家的民族独立和政治独立。作为一个爱好和平国家的印度，在解决许多极其重要的国际问题方面起着越来越大的作用。它在积极争取维护和巩固世界和平。已经摆脱殖民统治的印度各族人民，顽强地寻求自己的国家发展的道路。印度共和国政府在杰出的国家领导人和政治家——敬爱的贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁总理领导下，始终不渝地奉行不依赖其他国家的政策。这是值得深切尊重的。
    我们两国间紧密的来往和切实的合作是对双方都有利益的。
    我们也是本着这种考虑接受了缅甸政府和阿富汗政府的访问这两个国家的邀请。
    我们知道，我们前往印度、缅甸和阿富汗访问会引起某些殖民者的不满，因为他们担心，苏联和不久之前还在他们统治之下的国家之间的友谊的加强将促使进一步削弱殖民国家的地位。
    但是殖民老爷只应该埋怨自己。
    大家知道，苏联同其他国家的合作和友好的原则，是同那些作为殖民政策的基础的原则有根本的区别的。苏联树立了深刻了解和尊重一切民族和一切国家（不分大小）的利益的榜样，它这样做的出发点是：所有民族都是平等的，并且没有劣等的民族。
    苏联在加强同其他国家的友谊的时候，并没有强要它们接受自己的意志，并没有像帝国主义国家那样，提出什么先决条件。它并不从中替自己找什么特别的好处。它的出发点是，同平等的对方打交道，对方的利益是应该受到尊重的。
    每个国家的人民都有权按照他们自己的愿望来建设自己的生活。一个国家奴役或是掠夺另一个国家是最大的不义和耻辱。
    各国人民一律平等、一国不干涉别国的内政、互不侵犯、各国不问它们政治制度如何而和平共处——我们同别国的关系始终是建立在这些原则上的。我们严格遵守这些原则，我们同亚洲国家的越来越密切的合作迫使殖民主义者改变他们对这些国家的策略（他们是力图在这些国家中保持自己的地位），并且使这些国家的处境好转。
    而这一点，是一个重要性不小的因素。
    我们也注意到，我们访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗将不仅有助于我们这些国家领导人的接近，而且有助于人民的接近。印度、缅甸、阿富汗的人民有机会更多地了解苏联，了解苏联人民的生活。而这将有助于加强我们的友好联系。最后，我们坚定地相信，我们的访问印度、缅甸、阿富汗会更加加强世界和平，会削弱战争拥护者的阵营。即使就以这一点来说，我们的这次访问也是十分必要的。因为，和平事业是一个伟大的事业，它反映了全人类最大的愿望。
    现在我们可以说，对我们这次访问所寄托的那些巨大的希望，是完全实现了。
    （经久不息的掌声）
    代表同志们！
    我不打算向你们谈访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的印象，因为这需要很多时间。我只想说一点，就是这些印象是极其强烈而激动人心的。它们是难忘的，而最强烈的印象就是同人民会见的印象。
    我们曾经料想到，在印度会受到领导人的热烈欢迎，会受到人民的热烈欢迎。但是，当我们到达那里之后，立刻就感觉到，一切都超过了我们的预料。
    无论是在印度共和国首都德里，或是在印度其他各省邦和各城市，都有几十万、几百万人来欢迎我们。而且这是特别恳切的欢迎，在这种欢迎中表现了印度人民对苏联人民的热爱。
    我们无论到那里，总是被朋友们包围起来，他们为印度和苏联永恒和牢不可破的友谊而欢呼。就像在和睦的家庭里迎接可爱的兄弟一样，在印度各族人民的大家庭里，我们，伟大的苏联人民的使者，受到了热情、欢欣的迎接。（经久不息的掌声）
    缅甸人民、吴努总理和缅甸联邦其他领导人也给予了我们这种诚心诚意的接待。我们在阿富汗也受到了人民、首相穆罕默德·达乌德汗先生和阿富汗其他领导人的如此热情的接待。
    当然，我们一点儿也不以为，印度、缅甸和阿富汗人民对我们的狂欢和热爱的表示是给予我们个人的。
    我们认为这是我们友好的国家的人民对苏联各族人民无限热爱和尊敬的表示。
    我们认为这是印度、缅甸和阿富汗人民对苏联人民在争取世界和平、争取全人类的光辉的未来的斗争中的历史功勋的真诚承认。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们在印度、缅甸和阿富汗的时候，曾经同这些国家的政府就国际政治中许多最重要的问题广泛地交换了意见。我们到处都对曾经讨论过的一切问题取得了共同的互相谅解，我们所讨论的主要是社会制度不同的国家和平共处的问题，进一步发展我们这几个国家之间的经济和文化联系的问题。
    在会谈中显出了我们看法的一致，我们很快地就这些问题求得了大家可以接受的解决办法，而且商定了联合声明和协定的恰当措辞。
    在印度是这样，在缅甸是这样，在阿富汗也是这样，这是我们感到很愉快的。
    难道这还不是在说明，尽管各国社会制度不同，然而只要各国领导人具有善意和真诚的愿望，那就可以而且必须用和平的方式来解决各国关系中的一切问题吗？
    大家知道现在有着这样一些共同的问题，这些问题的解决是没有争执的，是大家都可以接受的，不管是生活在资本主义国家或者社会主义国家的一切人民都同样地关心这些问题的解决。在解决这些问题上，我们可以成功地实行合作。
    也许，苏联同印度的相互关系是这种情况的最生动的和令人信服的范例，苏联和印度的社会和国家制度是各不相同的，我们和印度领导人对许多问题有着不同的看法。无论是我们或者是我们的朋友——印度国家的领导人——都不隐瞒这一点。但是，这并不妨碍我们和我们的印度朋友坚持我们的作为同其他国家的相互关系的基础的和平共处的五项原则，维持和发展苏联和印度两国之间的友好关系。我们两国之间的诚意和友好关系在不断加强和发展。
    我们同缅甸联邦以及同我们的老朋友和好邻居阿富汗的相互关系，也在朝着这个方向发展。
    由于我们访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的结果，苏联和这些国家之间缔结了符合于苏联、印度、缅甸和阿富汗的利益的互惠的经济协定。
    我们认为印度共和国、缅甸联邦和阿富汗这些国家是争取世界和平斗争中的平等伙伴。我们同我们所访问的国家的领导人之间在为争取和平而斗争的问题上没有不同的意见。而这是一些主要问题，全人类都密切地关心这些问题的解决。
    我们在印度、缅甸和阿富汗的访问，以及苏联—印度、苏联—缅甸和苏联—阿富汗会谈的结果，给了世界上所有的朋友以良好的印象。
    但是，我们的访问在有些国家中引起了某些人士、其中包括官方人士的不友好的对待，甚至于公开的敌视，引起了对我们恶意的攻击。
    这主要是在英国和美国。在其他国家也有这样一些共鸣，更确切地说，是随声附和，譬如在加拿大，外交部长皮尔逊先生发表了一个没有远见的声明。
    为什么会这样呢？
    他们指责我们，教训我们，还用其他方式来影响我们，这是因为我们说的反对殖民主义者的话照他们看来是不正确的，是因为我们尖锐地指责了帝国主义者压迫和奴役殖民地和附属国人民的这种制度。
    究竟我们对殖民主义者和殖民制度说了些什么新的东西呢？为什么我们的话引起了殖民主义者和他们的辩护人如此的愤怒呢？我们说的毕竟是大家都知道的而且是无可置辩的事实。
    例如，英国殖民主义者，——不是人民，是殖民主义者！——统治印度将近二百年，他们曾经长期地压迫过缅甸和阿富汗的人民，这是事实。
    结果如何呢！
    我不妨引用这个问题的权威、大家尊敬的印度共和国总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生说的话。
    他在“印度的发现”这本书中着重指出，“最明显的事实是：英国在印度的统治一无建树，它破坏了印度的生活。”尼赫鲁写道，“外国政权不可避免地使自己同它所统治的人民的创造力相隔绝。当这个外国政权的经济和文化中心远离被奴役国家以及当它依赖种族主义的时候，这种隔绝就臻于完全，并且使被奴役的人民陷于精神上和文化上的贫困。”
    尼赫鲁先生在说明英国统治印度的后果的时候，提起了在第二次世界大战期间全国发生的可怖的饥荒的境况。他写道：
    “这次饥荒……揭露了在这些年代的英国统治后的一幅贫困、丑恶和人的堕落的景象。这是英国统治印度的顶点和最终的结果。这次饥荒并不是天灾或者自然力的作用造成的，它也不是由于实际的战争行动或者敌人的封锁造成的。每一个权威的观察家都认为，它是人为的，它原来是可以预见和避免的。”
    这里可以补充一点：据印度经济学家、“印度的粮食问题”这本书的作者辛格的统计，仅在19世纪的最后25年当中，印度就遭到了18次饥荒，在这段时期中饿死的有2，600万人。在20世纪中饥荒的范围更加扩大了。仅在1943年，印度就饿死了350万人。
    事实就是这样。这些事实是不利于殖民主义者的。
    同样遭过英国殖民主义者统治的缅甸人民的命运也是这样悲惨。早在1824年，英国就开始用武力侵略缅甸，1885年它完全占领了这个国家。治理缅甸的是一个英国派来的、具有无限的权力的总督。
    在第二次世界大战期间，缅甸被日本占领了。1945年日本投降后，英国殖民当局又回到了缅甸，企图重新建立统治。但是，在反抗日本占领的斗争中成长起来的缅甸爱国力量对他们进行了坚决的反抗。1948年1月，英国帝国主义者被迫给予缅甸独立。
    印度人民以及缅甸人民和阿富汗人民并没有请殖民主义者去掠夺他们的国家。殖民主义者是经过侵略和掠夺性的战争而后确立了对这些国家的统治的。当殖民主义者侵入印度和缅甸的时候，印度和缅甸的领土并不是一片荒凉的土地，在这些国家居住的人民有自己高度的文化。譬如，印度人民的文化，按它的水平来说，大家知道并不低于欧洲各国、其中包括英国。但是，印度在军事上是一个软弱的国家，它的武装比较差。只是因为这一点，它才成为殖民主义者的猎获物。
    现在有些拥护殖民制度的人说：
    “难道你们没有看见吗，我们是自愿地给印度自由的”。
    而这种说法，说得客气一点，是对殖民主义者怎样和为什么离开印度并且同意独立的印度共和国存在这一事实的一种十分勉强的解释。
    他们不得不同意这样，因为他们别无其他出路。如果他们还想硬待在印度，那就会受到很大的损失，而结果还是照样会被印度人民赶出去，就像在中国的各种各样的殖民主义者连同蒋介石卖国集团一起被中国人民赶出去一样。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    殖民主义者有时还爱说，他们在传播文明方面曾经起过巨大的历史作用。这种话只好用来骗骗傻子或者是不知道历史的、十分轻信别人的人。
    难道英国殖民主义者真的会提高被他们所掠夺的国家的人民群众的文化、帮助这些国家建立自己的工业、发展科学、提高人民的福利吗？不会，他们是一些十足的强盗。他们掠夺这些国家，大大地阻碍了它们的发展。我记得，在孟买我们访问一个牛奶场的时候，孟买省的首席部长德赛先生诉苦地说：
    在英国统治的年代里，一切都化为乌有。在这两百年中，我们几乎成了野人。
    印度、缅甸和其他曾经受殖民主义者主宰的国家的人民，需要作不少的努力来消除殖民主义者的统治所留下的恶劣的后果。
    事实是，就在不久以前印度还有80％多的居民、缅甸有63％的居民是文盲。
    事实是，印度居民的生活水平大大低于英国居民的生活水平，对印度的剥削确实养肥了英国资本家。这种情况在缅甸和其他曾经长期受殖民主义者主宰的国家也可以看到。
    拥护殖民制度的人向我们说，对不起，这些国家都是参加英联邦的，它们同英国差不多处在平等的地位。但是这种平等在什么地方呢？这种平等的一点点痕迹我们都看不见。我们看见的是，英国殖民主义者在他们的统治时期，在印度和缅甸为自己建造了漂亮的宫殿。
    他们照顾转到他们那一边去的一小撮封建主，支持那些人。但是，上亿的印度人民处在没有权利的地位，遭受着极其残酷的剥削。印度人民自然是不能容忍这种境况的。印度人民，以甘地、尼赫鲁等领导人这样一些杰出人物为首的反对殖民主义者统治印度的全体战士们，在争取得到印度的政治独立方面起了巨大的作用。而我们，当然是同情他们的斗争，为他们的成功感到高兴，对他们在这一斗争中所表现的英勇给予应有的评价。（经久不息的掌声）
    现在有人对我们说，我们反对殖民主义者，我们揭露他们的掠夺政策，就是对英国和其他国家表示了某种不友好情绪，虽然这些其他国家我们没有指明，就是英国我们也并不是常常指明的。（全场活跃）可是，我们并不打算玩捉迷藏。我们和全世界都知道在印度、缅甸和阿富汗谁做过殖民主义者。
    是的，我们在谈到殖民主义者的不体面的角色的时候，我们指的是英国殖民主义者。但是，殖民主义者并不是整个英国，也不是它的人民。英国殖民主义者永远没有权利把自己同英国人民混为一谈。
    在我们的讲话中一点也没有侮辱英国或者英国人民的地方。我们十分尊重能干勤劳的英国人民，并且希望同他们友好。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们对英国政府也没有说过侮辱的或者是难堪的话。但是我们过去和现在一直谴责殖民制度，并且认为，殖民制度越早结束就越好，因为它是一种十分不合理的、仇视人类的制度。殖民地国家越早挣脱它就越好。我们是那些反对殖民奴役和殖民依赖的人的最真心的朋友。（掌声）我们将为殖民制度的消灭而高兴和庆贺。我认为，大多数的英国人民也将欢迎这一点。（掌声）
    殖民主义者在殖民地和附属国中喧宾夺主地横行无忌的时代过去了。可是，殖民主义者自己当然不愿意自动地放弃使他们有机会掠夺整个整个国家的那种制度。不能指望这一点。
    我们想用我们的言论和行动来对那些还没有摆脱殖民压迫的各国人民表示我们的同情和同感，我们同情他们为自己的民族解放而进行的斗争。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们懂得，殖民主义者所以生我们的气，并不是因为我们的讲话谴责了殖民主义者在印度和缅甸的过去的活动。
    他们竭力替曾经压迫殖民地和附属国人民的自己的先辈的活动作某种辩护，是为了维持仍然有势力的殖民主义者现在的阵地。因为殖民主义者现在还有许多殖民地。
    就拿非洲来说吧。整个非洲都被欧洲国家和欧洲以外的国家瓜分了。现在有执行殖民政策的各种形式和各种方法，但是殖民奴役的锁链并没有因此而松一些。这种锁链窒息着殖民地和附属国的人民，引起他们对殖民主义者的仇恨。
    这些国家的人民越来越坚决地起来反对殖民制度。我们同情这种斗争，祝进行这种斗争的人民获得胜利。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    简直令人奇怪，有些眼光短浅的人物竟责难我们对英国或者美国不友好，他们说，似乎我们想使这些国家同印度、缅甸和其他国家争吵。其实他们自己才干着对这些国家不友好的事情。
    例如，印度人士对杜勒斯先生和葡萄牙外交部长库纳先生就果阿问题发表的声明能够抱着怎样的态度呢？
    只要想一想杜勒斯所说的话，他竟公然说，印度的领土果阿该当属于葡萄牙，只是因为葡萄牙征服者是在四百年前掠夺这块土地的。
    印度报刊就这一点正当地提醒杜勒斯先生：在250年以前，现在的美利坚合众国是英国的殖民地，如果依照他的逻辑，那末他杜勒斯现在也应该把自己看作是大不列颠女王陛下的臣民。（场内笑声，掌声）
    同意杜勒斯先生的声明，就意味着，不仅是赞扬殖民压迫制度，而且是要使它永存。
    当然，我们不能同意这一点。我们认为，这是一个不正确的声明，是由于对人民的利益抱有不正确的态度而作出的。印度人民和印度的领导人也都恰如其分地对杜勒斯和库纳关于果阿的联合声明作了评价，这个声明是对文明国家的一种耻辱。
    乘此机会让我再对印度人民合情合理地异常关切的另一个问题谈几句话，这就是所谓克什米尔问题。尼古拉·亚历山德罗维奇·布尔加宁和我在访问克什米尔的时候就已经明确地说出了苏联人民对这个问题抱什么态度，这个问题不是从人民中间产生的，而是由某些企图挑拨人民之间的仇恨的国家人为地拨弄起的。
    在克什米尔，我们看到，克什米尔的人民把他们的领土看作印度共和国的不可分割的一部分。克什米尔人民已经不可更改地解决了这个问题，我们也深深地相信，克什米尔人民终归是能够不受外来的干涉而处理好自己的事务的，不管那些想在克什米尔制造不安和国际摩擦的祸根的人是不是欢喜这一点。（掌声）
    苏联人民对印度人民和印度政府关心巩固自己的国家和关心满足印度共和国国内各民族的合理愿望是亲近和了解的，正像我们对为了自己民族独立而奋斗的各国人民的愿望是亲近和了解的一样。
    我们在印度和缅甸的讲话中说过，我们的国家既是欧洲国家又是亚洲国家，它的比较大一部分的领土是在亚洲大陆。我们同时着重指出，苏联各族人民——不管他们是住在国家的欧洲部分或是亚洲部分，不问他们的肤色和宗教信仰如何——构成各族人民的统一的兄弟大家庭，这个大家庭由于牢不可破的友谊而坚强有力。我国各族人民团结在建设共产主义的伟大目标之下。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    苏联是一个由十六个平等的、自愿结合的加盟共和国组成的伟大的多民族的国家。我国的整个政权属于苏维埃社会的劳动者——工人阶级、劳动农民和知识分子。
    我们一向反对民族压迫，反对任何形式的人剥削人的现象，尤其反对给人类带来了无数灾难的殖民主义者的统治。我们在印度和缅甸的讲话中又一次极其直截了当和坦率地谈到了这一点，并且着重指出，殖民制度是反人民的和十分不合理的制度。
    殖民主义者现在为什么这样惊慌呢？
    他们之所以惊慌是因为我们的话引起了人民群众广泛的共鸣。这不仅是在那些我们曾经讲过话的地方，而且还有听见了我们讲的话的地方，以及将会不止一次地听到苏联表示谴责压迫和奴役各国人民的殖民制度的不可动摇的立场的地方。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    这是真理的话，帝国主义者不可能用任何铁幕拦住这些话的。
    应当指出，在谴责杜勒斯的立场的不仅是那些反对殖民主义的人，也还有那些不反对殖民制度的人。不妨引几句美国参议员克弗维尔所讲话来看看。
    他说，“首先，美国应当在亚洲完全放弃老式的殖民主义。”
    请大家注意一下，克弗维尔先生号召的不是放弃一切殖民主义，而是放弃“老式的”殖民主义。（笑声，全场活跃）
    他希望殖民主义者寻求加强自己的殖民统治的新形式，鼓吹“时式的”殖民主义。
    因此他号召：“我们不应当让我们的援助被用来支持不好的政府。”
    这是极有价值的承认。
    殖民主义者看到，人民是如何坚决地奋起反对殖民奴役。他们看到，人民决心去作自我牺牲的奋斗，去建立英勇的功勋，去为本国的自由和民族独立作奋不顾身的斗争。许多国家的人民已经赶走了殖民主义者。
    伟大的中国人民的斗争是鼓舞一切殖民地和附属国人民的范例，中国人民挣脱了外国压迫的锁链，自己掌握了自己的命运，在光荣的共产党的领导下建立了强大的中华人民共和国，现在正在胜利地建设社会主义。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）
    现在，殖民主义者决定改变自己的殖民统治的形式了。他们越来越少地采用像派自己的军队到殖民地国家去和其他蛮横地干涉被奴役国的事务这样一些粗暴的施加压力的形式。
    他们现在作得越来越圆滑了：收买人，收买有产者的政权，扶植“好政府”，建立类似巴格达条约的侵略集团。
    他们拿出金钱来进行所谓“经济援助”，“无偿地”把武器供应给某些国家。但是获得武器的国家应当向殖民主义者提供炮灰、建立庞大的军队、从而使本国人民枯竭，以作为获得这些武器的代价。
    殖民主义者在“援助”的幌子下给人一块金元，这是为了要在以后靠剥削那些接受这种“援助”的人民而获得十块金元。达到这个目的以后，他们就在政治上也奴役起人民来了，这就是殖民主义者统治的“新”形式。
    而这不仅是指亚非国家或者是其他的所谓落后国家而言。现在，美国垄断资本家在不遗余力地带着这些形式的“援助”渗入欧洲国家。现在连北大西洋公约组织也很强烈地带有这种气味了。
    美国为什么会这样“宽洪大量”呢？它为什么会不要钱地把军备供给包括本身也很发达的西德在内的欧洲国家呢？它追求这样一个目的：不仅把落后国家、而且把高度发达的国家也用金链条拴到自己这边来。
    我们揭露这种政策说，北大西洋公约组织和其他类似的集团是一些抱着深远的政治目标和经济目标的组织。
    有人说，北大西洋公约组织之所以建立、据说是因为苏联表现出侵略野心，因此似乎就必须建立一支北大西洋公约组织成员国的超级强大的联合军队，用它来对抗苏联和社会主义阵营各国。
    不难理解是谁需要撒这种谎话而且是为了什么。有人所以要撒这种谎，是为了要使人民群众不去注意越来越依赖于美国垄断资本家的那些国家中所发生的变化。
    然而，人为造成的幻景现在就已经开始在破灭，大家开始分辨，哪里是真理，哪里是骗局。
    大家开始在这样议论：如果苏联的确是想用战争的办法来为其他国家的新的社会制度开辟道路的话，那末它早就这样做了。
    的确，在战争结束的时候，兵力最强的是苏联，这谁不知道呢？那时，没有任何东西阻碍苏联把自己的充分动员起来的军队向前推进并且占领整个欧洲。但是，这种情况并没有发生，而且也不可能发生。
    大家都很清楚马克思列宁主义的下列理论，这就是：革命不能输出，革命要由争取自己解放的人民自己去完成。苏联人过去是，将来也要始终遵循着伟大的列宁所指示的、规定不干涉别国内政的、和平共处的方针。（经久不息的掌声）
    为什么在战争结束之后，有些帝国主义集团鼓吹战争歇斯底里，企图用臆造的“苏联威胁”来恐吓人民呢？
    他们这样做，是为了他们自私的利益。
    他们的目的是很明显的：帝国主义者需要这样做，是为了使他们可以不受惩罚地奴役人民和靠巨额的税收来发展军事工业，这就是热衷于战争的垄断资本巨头的关心所在。
    他们在这上面捞取巨额的资本。只要提一提下面这个事实就够了：美国的大垄断资本现在靠军事生产而得到的利润要比战争时期多一倍多。
    根据初步的材料，1955年美国公司的利润达到430亿美元，于是，垄断资本家就有钱把所谓“援助”给予那些被美国拖入它的势力范围内的国家。实际上这不是援助，而是老爷从桌子上扔下来的施舍，是附有苛刻的条件的。
    苏联谴责这种政策。它同各国的相互关系是以平等、互利、不干涉他国内政为基础的。
    我们对这些或者那些国家给予经济或者技术帮助的时候，我们是作为朋友而这样做的，没有强使别人接受自己的条件。
    我们没有多余的资本。我们按照计划来管理我们的经济。我们并不关心资本的输出，不关心商品的输出，我们所生产的商品只供我们的国家和我们的同盟者的需要，以及保证对外贸易的需要，我们有一些商品的产量暂时不够满足国家的日益增长的需要。
    虽然这样，我们还是认为有责任同我们的朋友共甘苦，兄弟般地帮助他们。这种在互利条件下的帮助是彼此都有利益的。我们的朋友知道，他们从我们这里得到的无私的帮助是从我们的内部资金中抽出来的。而这点朋友们是不会不重视的，因为这说明了我们的正直的愿望。
    在这种条件下，垄断资本家不得不换一下花样了。某些比较有头脑的资产阶级人士现在说，必需加强资本主义国家对落后国家的经济援助。这倒不坏，就让资本主义国家提供这种援助吧。这要比把这些国家拖入军事集团和联盟好得多。
    资本主义国家打算向不久以前获得了独立的国家提供的援助，不能不认为是苏联对这些国家提供的间接援助。如果不是有苏联存在，难道垄断资本集团和帝国主义国家还会向落后国家提供援助吗？当然不会。这种事以前一直还不曾有过。（全场活跃，掌声）
    我已经说过，按照资本主义理解的所谓“无偿”援助实际上能导致对受援者的奴役，如果这些国家不加选择地对待它的话。
    不久以前，英国前外交大臣麦克米伦先生在综述保守党政府所取得的成就时说，这个政府成功地解决了同伊朗的事务，结果，阿巴丹的石油大量流入英国。
    而这是伊朗的财富在外流。这就是黄金从伊朗流进英国、美国、荷兰和法国的银行的保险库。而这个时候正是伊朗人民遭受贫困的时候。他们一面在“援助”伊朗，一面在不出分文地括走伊朗的石油，他们靠这个、靠伊朗人民的饥饿和贫困来养肥自己。
    我们并不向亚洲人民说：你们不要接受美国和英国垄断资本家给你们的援助。但是我们要诚恳地提醒他们，对这种“援助”是要小心的，因为垄断资本家是不会无代价地给人好处的。
    资本家是不会无代价地做任何事情的。没有利润，资本就不可能存在。
    代表同志们！
    我已经说过，这次访问印度，同印度国家领导人的会见，同各省邦领导人的会见，同印度工人、农民和知识分子的会见，同我们所碰到的所有人的会见，给我们留下了最好的回忆。
    我们十分珍惜同印度以及同它伟大的勤劳的人民的友谊，同尼赫鲁先生以及同我们接触过的印度其他杰出人物的友谊，我们愿意保持和发展我们的友好关系。
    我们和我们的印度朋友们都希望在不损及两国同其他国家的友好关系的情况下，发展和加强这种友好关系。
    我们这样来理解我们的友谊：我们不应该把友好联系限于对一个、两个或是一些国家。我们愿意同一切国家友好。因此，我们也为我们的朋友们同别的国家发展友好关系感到高兴，这些国家中也包括那些由于各种各样原因而同我们的关系有些不和和冷淡的国家。我们希望通过我们的朋友来改善同这些国家的关系，我们认为印度就是这样的朋友。
    我们过去和现在始终是真诚地希望同各国友好，其中包括资本主义国家。例如，我们愿意同最强大的资本主义国家——美国、英国和法国友好地相处。如果能做到这一点，那就为两种制度的真正的和平共处和和平竞赛创造了条件，而这一点主要的不是取决于我们，而是取决于美国、英国和法国的政府和人民。
    遗憾的是，我们暂时还没有做到这一点，但是我们不放弃希望，并且将不吝惜自己的力量努力朝这方面做。（掌声）
    我们对印度领导人的立场是完全理解和支持的，他们宣布，印度在我们和其他国家之间采取中立地位。印度的确是中立的国家，它值得我们以及其他国家对它表示信任和尊敬。
    我们同伟大的中华人民共和国有最亲密的关系。我们两国人民是兄弟。
    我们同印度共和国的良好的友善关系也已经形成并且在不断巩固中。我们在印度的任何一个地方都听到发自人民内心深处的这句话：印地露西巴伊巴伊！”——“印度人和俄国人是兄弟！”（暴风雨般的掌声）
    而苏联、中华人民共和国和印度共和国占人类的一半，是一支争取维护和巩固世界和平的强大的力量。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    代表同志们！
    一些外国人士以及极其不慎重的资产阶级记者在讨论我们访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的结果以及分析我们在这些国家的讲话的时候指责苏联，说我们抛弃了“日内瓦精神”。这是不对的。
    我们在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上对缓和国际紧张局势作出重大贡献方面起了最积极的作用。
    在政府首脑的会议上以及在被责成讨论保障欧洲安全和与此有关的德国问题、裁军问题和发展东西方接触的这些极其重要问题的外交部长会议上，我们都争取国际紧张局势的缓和。
    致力于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的各国爱好和平的人民所争取的结果现在暂时还没有达到，这并不是我们的过错。
    四国政府首脑和外交部长的日内瓦会议，特别是政府首脑会议受到全世界人民的热烈欢迎。各国人民对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的愿望使这些会议的参加者不得不相应地拟定他们的发言和建议。遗憾的是，不得不承认，参加政府首脑会议的西方国家代表只限于说一些赞成缓和国际紧张局势的好听话。他们的外交部长尤其是如此，他们不愿意真正地下功夫并且作努力去争取达到政府首脑会议向他们提出的目标。这说明，派出自己的高级代表出席四国政府首脑会议的西方国家的政府并没有具体地解决会议议程上所列的各项问题的愿望。他们出席会议，是迫于舆论对他们的压力而作的让步。
    召开四国政府首脑会议这件事本身，大家在会上发表的那些讲话，政府首脑为他们的外交部长所订出的行动纲领，这一切当然都有助于国际紧张局势的缓和，使人产生了对防止军事冲突和消除“冷战”作出某种更具体的措施的希望。
    “日内瓦精神”就这样诞生了。
    各国人民欢迎它，因为他们希望安宁，希望减轻赋税和减少军费开支，希望把这一大笔钱用在提高居民的生活水平上。这就是各国人民具体的愿望。
    但是，人民所喜欢的，人民所期望的，恰巧就是制造原子弹、氢弹和其他武器的资本家所不喜欢的。缩减军备的前途，尤其是裁军的前途，在垄断资本家看来，就是降低利润的前途，而降低利润是他们无论如何不能同意的。
    这就是为什么四国政府首脑会议刚一结束，那些生产毁灭性武器的人和那些身居资本主义国家领导职位而执行上述一类人的意志的人，不仅不打算加深和扩大“日内瓦精神”，而且相反地却极力想把它在萌芽的时候就扼死。
    至于说到苏联，它的代表在四国政府首脑会议和外交部长会议中曾经竭尽他们所有的全部力量以求达到圆满的结果。
    可惜，我们这种努力没有引起对方同样的努力，全人类关心的问题没有得到解决。
    我们将不惜一切力量，以求这些问题最终得到圆满的解决。但是要做到这一点，光靠我们的努力是不够的。还需要我们的对方的努力。
    最后，千千万万人的舆论的力量还需要起重大的作用，这种力量主张保障安全、裁军、缓和国际紧张局势、停止“冷战”。
    今天最尖锐的问题，就是保障欧洲安全的问题。其他国际问题的解决都有赖于这一问题的解决。但是，你们知道，我们的谈判对方——美国、英国、法国，用德国问题来对抗这个问题。
    他们的立场是，把德意志民主共和国归并到西德，取消德意志民主共和国劳动人民的社会成果，把这个统一起来的而且是加入北大西洋公约组织的德国武装到牙齿。在这些条件下，他们就不反对在“欧洲安全”条约上签字，然而事实上这样不仅不会使欧洲安全得到保障，而且相反，会大大加深在欧洲发生新战争、从而为各国人民带来一切严重的战争后果的威胁。
    这种立场的辩护人并不隐瞒，策划出这样的军事联合的唯一目的是要加强北大西洋公约组织成员国的阵营，为这个阵营创造优势，以便迫使苏联和人民民主国家向它们投降，接受它们的条件。
    多么好的“安全”！
    每个具有常识的人都会懂得，这样的计划是一定不能实现的。如果真想解决保障欧洲安全的问题，那就必须采取认真的态度，考虑现实局面。
    这种现实局面的特点首先在于：在德国的领土上现在形成了两个政治和社会制度各不相同的国家，其中的一个——德意志民主共和国正在为加强和平和民主而斗争。而另一个国家——德意志联邦共和国的领导人却是“实力地位”政策的忠实信徒，而且，德意志联邦共和国就是北大西洋公约组织侵略集团的成员。
    这说明什么问题呢？这说明在目前的条件下，没有重新统一这两个完全不同的德国的现实可能。但是这是不是说现在没有可能保障欧洲集体安全，以有助于保障世界和平呢？不，不是这样。
    无论是英国或者苏联、法国或者波兰、捷克斯洛伐克或者比利时——所有的欧洲国家以及美国都关心保障欧洲安全，关心为巩固和平创造条件。
    如果真正从这个前提出发，如果注意一下现在加入了互相对立的国家集团的两个德国可能成功地参加全欧安全体系（这个体系将代替上述两个集团），那末问题就可能得到符合人民利益的解决。
    我们看不到另外的解决办法。没有人能强迫我们用自己的双手去加强反对苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的军事集团。（掌声）
    那些要我们同意这种德国统一的办法、也就是会使统一后的德国参加侵略性的反苏集团的办法的人正是要想达到这个目的。
    我们希望德国人，特别是西德的德国人首先能够在这个问题上正确地理解我们。苏联、德国和欧洲人民民主国家的人民曾经两度卷入血腥的世界战争，在这两次战争中遭受损失最大的是我国人民和德国人民。现在已经是考虑这种情况，并且找出避免将来惨祸重演的正确解决办法的时候了。
    至于谈到我们同西德的关系，我们已经不止一次地声明过，为了苏联和德意志联邦共和国的利益，在我们两国之间建立良好的友好关系是适宜的。建立这种关系是有一切条件的。
    我顺便指出，我们为保障全欧安全和相应地解决德国问题而作的努力决不违反英法两国的利益，相反地，假定美国好战分子的关于把统一后的德国拉入侵略集团的这种完全不切实际的梦想实现的话，在这种场合下，法国人和英国人就未必能平静地生活。那时，德国复仇主义分子就没有拘束了。他们就可以随意行动，而法国自然就成了他们眼中的一块诱人的肥肉。
    我们说到这一点，决不是因为我们希望发生这种事情。不是的，我们将竭尽努力不让这种事情发生。但是，历史经验告诉我们，这种危险是有的，由于法国比苏联和人民民主国家软弱，英国也是比较软弱，就更加有这种危险。
    因此，我们真诚希望，法国和英国也能够正确地理解我们。如果我们不是把力量消耗在准备彼此互相反对的斗争上，而是共同努力，寻找欧洲安全问题的正确解决，岂不更好呢？（经久不息的掌声）
    谈到这里，我想提一提，法国总理富尔先生和英国首相艾登先生在日内瓦所作的建议给保障欧洲安全的谈判提供了基础。
    这个问题如果能达成协议，就能够促成其他极其重要的问题，包括裁军问题在内，得到解决。
    大家知道，无论是在两次日内瓦会议上或者是在联合国里，苏联都曾经提出过关于裁减军备、关于禁止原子武器和氢武器以及关于建立国际监督等一系列具体的建议。美国态度的改变妨碍了在这些问题上达成协议，美国是在当我们同意把他们的建议作为基础的时候，突然推翻了他们自己从前提出的建议。
    目前，美国实质上一笔勾消了裁减军备问题，而把艾森豪威尔总统在日内瓦提出来的关于交换军事情报和关于无阻碍地进行空中摄影的唯一的建议提到首要地位。
    我们已经指出了空中摄影的建议不能解决问题的实质。在事实上没有规定裁减军备而且还打算扩充军备的情形下，在领土上空飞行和实行空中摄影只能助长好战的欲望和战争的狂热。这么一来不但不是监督，甚至没有一点监督的味道。实质上这只是为探明其他国家的实力所采取的手段。
    用这种方法取得的情报可能被用来选择最方便时刻对这个国家发动突然的进攻，难道这还不明白吗？试问，这同所谓军事侦察有什么不同？实质上是没有什么不同的。
    下面这样的态度是另外一回事，即对裁军问题采取一种现实的态度：主张就军备
  水平、禁止原子武器和氢武器达成协议，主张对铁道枢纽、海军基地、飞机场等等建立合理的、目前条件所许可的国际监督制度以便能够防止一个国家对另一个国家的突然进攻。这样的措施是完全切实可行的，并且会受到各国人民的欢迎。
    某些反对裁军的人的出发点是这样一种虚假的前提：硬说他们的实力有某种优势，因此裁军对他们不利。我们过去警告，现在还要警告这些维护声名狼籍的“实力地位”政策的人，他们在自己的赌博中可能大大失算。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）
    我们不想吓唬谁，我们更不想夸耀我们现有的军事技术成就。但是为了使那些最热衷于扩充军备的人的狂热冷一冷，我们应当追述一下不久前苏联进行的最新的氢弹的试验的结果。
    像已经宣布的那样，这种武器的威力相当于好几百万吨普通爆炸物的威力，而且它还可以大大增强。我们依然主张禁止生产、试验和使用一切类型的原子武器和氢武器。但是反对这样作的人不应忘记上述试验的结果。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    日内瓦会议讨论过的关于发展东西方接触的问题也具有很大意义。苏联以实际行动促进这种接触的发展。例如，我们由于希望缓和国际紧张局势和同外国各种人士建立事务接触，对于表示想来苏联研究苏联生活的外国人，我们过去和现在从来不拒绝发给签证。
    今年来到我们国家的有许多美国参议员和众议员，我们乐意接待他们，并且同他们交谈。
    有许多反动的美国报纸的记者在苏联自由地旅行，这些人擅长于编造最荒唐的反苏文章。我们了解这一点，然而仍然让他们来苏联，虽然我们知道，这些新闻工作者到我们这儿来是为了日后写作贯穿着“冷战”精神的作品。
    美国当局还只允许一个人数不多的农业代表团、建筑工作者代表团和唯一的一批苏联记者到美国去，顺便说说，这批记者等签证就等了九个月。他们当中有的人在这段时间已经生了小孩。（全场活跃。掌声）
    我们愿意加强苏联人同美国和其他国家各种各样人士的接触。我们愿意加强相互间的友谊，但是不希望像某些人在日内瓦提议的那样让其他国家来干涉苏联内政，自然，我们是决不同意这样做的。
    不能不顺便指出，西方的某些政治家在最近时期对“日内瓦精神”作了至少是令人奇怪的理解。他们希望苏联单方面裁减军队，希望我们在道义上、精神上和意识形态上也解除武装。
    这种论调不是什么新东西，这样谈不是第一年了，虽然生活已经多次严厉地教训过那些企图把这种条件强加在苏联身上的人们。
    美国有人正在狂热地鼓吹对苏联采取这种不现实的政策，而现任的美国国务卿杜勒斯先生充当了鼓吹这种政策的别出心裁的理论家的这样一个不体面的角色。我这样说并不是揭露什么秘密。
    正是他，在长期以来积极宣传臭名远扬的“击退”，“大规模反击”的主张和其他荒谬绝伦的东西。
    美国的某些人士看来是不愿意正视现实，他们在目前条件下，在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议之后还企图使用老早破产了的“实力地位”政策的字眼。
    关于所谓应当对苏联“继续施加压力”“强迫赤色分子退却”的所有这些论调都是从这里出发的。
    这方面应当特别谈一下美国某些著名人物，其中包括大家知道曾经在日内瓦畅谈必须缓和国际紧张局势的艾森豪威尔总统在内，现在所采取的态度。
    我所指的是艾森豪威尔总统、杜勒斯国务卿和美国其他负责人士给人民民主国家人民的所谓“圣诞贺词”，这种贺词和“日内瓦精神”毫无共同之处，它不外是对作为联合国会员国的自由和主权国家的内政的粗暴干涉。
    这些美国人士在自己的“圣诞贺词”中说，他们在“祈祷”这些国家的现有制度能够有所改变，他们公开答应美国“支持”这种事情。
    难道这能证明对和解的愿望、证明对巩固和扩大“日内瓦精神”的努力吗？
    不，这恰恰会发生相反的作用，它会刺激感情的冲动，从而使军备竞赛加紧，战争威胁加剧。
    我很不愿意谈到这一切，特别是有关我所特别尊敬的艾森豪威尔先生。人家也许会说，赫鲁晓夫谈到这些问题是想消除“日内瓦精神”。但是其实，我不是自己在提出这些问题，而只是想回答那些破坏“日内瓦精神”、公然干涉我们的盟邦和朋友——人民民主国家的人。
    我们一谈到具有如此明显的政治色彩的“圣诞”贺词，就可以明白贺词的作者是怎样的人。他们代表一些相当大的公司。就拿这群人中像哈里曼先生这样可敬的代表人物来说吧。大家知道他有千百万的家财。其他的人的资本也不少，是多些还是少些，只有天晓得，我们没有数过他们的钱。但是，假如他们的钱比哈里曼少，他们无疑要想拥有比他还多的钱。
    这就是说，这里关心的不是人的良心，而是自己的钱袋。（场内笑声、掌声）
    “圣诞”贺词的作者主张改变人民民主国家的制度，那他们就是拥护已经被人民民主国家的劳动人民赶走了的拔佳、勒吉维尔、波托茨基、布拉帝扬努之类和其他大资本家和大地主。（经久不息的掌声）但是不能把这些国家的人民和拔佳、勒吉维尔、波托茨基、布拉帝扬努等类的人同样看待。
    完全不是宗教性质的“圣诞”贺词的美国作者同那些从人民民主国家中被赶出来的或者从那里逃出来的资本家的联系是极其紧密的。这些美国人想要改变人民民主国家中的新制度，希望这些国家中的资本主义制度复辟，把工厂还给资本家，把土地还给大地主。
    哈里曼先生不仅希望资本家回到这些国家去，而且他本人显然也想像过去一样地操纵匈牙利的经济，像匈牙利建立起人民民主政权以前他所做的那样。
    但是要想复辟是不可能了。不管什么样的圣诞贺词，无论对地主、资本家、银行家、大商人以及被人民民主国家的劳动人民从这些国家中赶出去的其他剥削者都不会有什么帮助。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）
    我们可以谈谈自己的经验。当我国人民推翻了资本主义制度，建立了世界上第一个工农国家的时候，国内和国外曾经有不少的资本主义旧制度的卫护者拚命地祷告，祈求资本主义旧制度在俄国复辟。
    国外曾经有人虔诚地为米留科夫、捷列申科、尤兹、里亚布申斯基之流以及其他大资本的代表人物祷告，祈求资本家和地主的政权复辟。但是结果怎样呢？
    国际帝国主义想使我国资本主义制度复辟的一切企图都遭到了失败。苏联人民在自己久经考验的领袖共产党的领导下粉碎了企图用强力、武器或其他各种手段在俄国恢复资本主义制度的一切人。
    我国人民满怀信心和坚定不移地沿着社会主义发展的道路前进，建成了世界上第一个社会主义社会，从而实现了劳动人类的世世代代的理想。他们建立了强大的社会主义工业，下列材料就足以说明社会主义工业发展的水平：在1955年，苏联全部工业的总产量增加到1913年的27倍，而生产资料的生产增加到60倍，电力生产增加到86倍，机器制造业产品生产增加到160倍以上。（暴风雨般，经久不息的掌声）
    我国农业在不断提高和发展。
    在革命前，俄国有76％的居民是文盲，而早在第二次世界大战之前我国的文盲已经基本扫除了，今年，在我国中小学和中等技术学校里学习的约有3，500万学生。现在，在高等学校里学习的有1，865，000名学生。苏联所培养出来的专家比英国、法国、意大利和西欧其他资本主义国家的总和要多得多。（掌声）
    像邱吉尔先生这样一个反对共产主义很起劲的人，他不仅曾经祈祷要资本主义制度在我国复辟，而且曾经用武力想在俄国重建这种制度，现在却也不得不承认苏联在培养专家方面大大超过了资本主义国家，这不是平白无故的。这使得邱吉尔先生发愁，但是我们却很高兴。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我国发展的显著成果是使各人民民主国家劳动人民和其他国家人民得到鼓舞的榜样。
    全世界各国人民，包括殖民地和附属国的人民在内，越来越坚决地反对人剥削人，反对一些国家压迫另外一些国家。
    这不能不认为是马克思列宁学说的伟大力量的表现，这个学说不断深入到全世界各处千千万万人的意识里。未来是属于这个学说的。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）
    各人民民主国家的劳动人民亲身体会到，只有推翻资本主义政权，而由人民掌握这个政权，才能得到真正的自由，所以他们要更紧密地团结在自己的共产党、工人党和劳动党的周围，来回答敌人的一切阴谋诡计。
    不管资本家是怎样暴跳如雷，他们分裂不了社会主义阵营。我们仍然将按照伟大列宁所指示的道路继续前进，我们将彼此紧紧地手牵着手共同前进，铲除阻挠着我们各国走向建成共产主义社会的一切障碍。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）最有远见的和清醒的英国、美国和法国人士懂得，西方国家某些人士最近所采取的立场是违反“日内瓦精神”的。譬如乔利勋爵不久以前的谈话，他承认说，西方国家对日内瓦外交部长会议的失败负有重大的责任。乔利说，“我应当说，依我看，硬说只有西方国家有道理这种理论是经不起任何驳斥的。”我顺便指出，我们没有驳斥这一点。（全场活跃）他说：“西方国家实际上在执行着在我看来是过时了的“实力政策”。而在苏联方面，我认为它已经作了许多重大的让步，执行了比我们灵活得多的政策，因而取得了优势。”不能不同意这样的估计。为了要嫁祸于人以及责难我们破坏“日内瓦精神”，某些资产阶级的记者就拿我的话，拿我们其他的国家活动家和政治家的话作借口。他们抱怨说，我们在发言中谈到马克思列宁主义学说一定胜利。不过，难道这就破坏了“日内瓦精神”了吗？不错，我们过去和现在都认为，在两种经济制度的和平竞赛中社会主义制度一定胜利，因为它是最先进最进步的制度，它是以唯一正确的马克思列宁主义学说为基础的。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    如果同我们对立的资本主义世界的思想家说，资本主义必然胜利，这并不使我们惊奇，我们也不表示抗议。我们认为这种争论是自然的，只有历史才能解决这种争论。
    如果某些人认为相信社会主义、马克思列宁主义学说必定胜利就是破坏了“日内瓦精神”，那末这些人显然对“日内瓦精神”作了不正确的理解。他们应该记住，我们从来没有放弃，而且也不会放弃自己的思想，放弃争取共产主义胜利的斗争。他们永远休想我们放弃思想武装！（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）
    我们对共产主义最后胜利的信念是资本主义拥护者所不喜欢的，这点并没有使我们惊奇，也没有使我们烦恼。然而我们说：在这个竞赛中，在这个斗争中我们决不发动侵略战争，我们将不倦地为反对扩充军备、为裁军、为加强和平和为和平共处而斗争。
    从此可见，事实令人信服地表明：破坏“日内瓦精神”的不是苏联，而是我们日内瓦会议的对方。
    我们再来举一个例子。签署关于日内瓦会议结果的联合公报的墨迹还没有干，我们会议的某些对方就开始又吸引一些国家参加侵略性的巴格达条约——他们已经把伊朗拉进了这个条约，并且还在拉其他国家。
    在最高苏维埃这次会议的第一天会议上，我们注意地倾听了伊朗议会代表团团长赛义德先生的发言，他说，伊朗人民希望和平，希望同苏联友好。
    我们欢迎这个讲话，但是我们不能不说明，尽管苏联对保证自己同伊朗的友好关系做了一切努力，可是伊朗政府仍然参加了巴格达军事集团，从而把自己的领土交给那些阴谋对苏联策划进攻的侵略势力支配。
    不仅伊朗这样，而且土耳其也是如此。大家知道，在凯末尔和伊诺努领导土耳其的时候，我们和土耳其有着很好的关系，但是后来这种关系就黯淡下去了。我们不能说，这完全是土耳其的过错，我们方面也发表了使这种关系黯淡下去的不适当的言论。
    但是在这以后我们这一方面采取了改变这种情况和恢复同土耳其的友好关系的措施。
    但是，遗憾的是，我们没有得到土耳其国家领导人方面的相应的措施。
    美国陆海军将领前往土耳其，他们发表好战的言论，以军舰的访问显示自己的实力。
    伊朗和土耳其政府把自己的命运同侵略性的巴格达条约联在一起，拒绝同苏联建立善邻友好关系，这种作法未必是明智的。
    巴基斯坦对它的邻邦的态度也有类似的情况，它也是巴格达条约的参加者。要知道这是事实：巴基斯坦同印度、同阿富汗、同苏联的关系有待于大大地改善。
    不能不提醒大家注意这一事实：美国海军上将雷德福最近访问了巴基斯坦，接着又访问了伊朗。他跑到这些国家去，显然不是为了加强经济和文化联系，而是完全抱有另外的目的。
    美国海军上将的这种访问证实了过去所表示的担心：巴基斯坦和伊朗不顾它们的民族利益，越来越深地被侵略集团组织者拉入冒险阴谋。可以毫无疑问，如果巴基斯坦采取譬如像印度那样的独立立场，那就为建立巴基斯坦和它的邻邦之间的友好关系创造了条件。
    我们相信，巴基斯坦人一定会懂得，他们的国家陷入了怎样一种不体面的境地，并且会作出必要的结论。我们这方面愿意同巴基斯坦建立友好关系。
    既然谈到巴格达条约，就得谈一谈近东和中东国家的情况。大家知道，巴格达条约的组织者拚命地要想把阿拉伯国家拖进这个侵略集团。但是他们遭到了这些国家人民越来越强烈的反抗。
    苏联公众一直同情地注视着像约旦这个国家的人民的英勇斗争，他们在反对企图用强力把约旦拖入巴格达条约的阴谋。
    我们理解阿拉伯国家人民的愿望，他们在争取彻底摆脱对外国的从属。另一方面，以色列国家的行动是应当谴责的，这个国家从一成立起就开始威胁自己的邻国，对它们采取不友好的政策。
    显然，这种政策是不符合以色列国家的民族利益的，显然有一些大家都知道的帝国主义国家在为执行这种政策的人撑腰。这些帝国主义国家想利用以色列作为它们反对阿拉伯国家人民的工具，以便贪婪地掠夺这个区域的天然财富。
    西方国家继续推行军备竞赛、拼凑侵略集团的政策，而苏联却始终如一地、坚定地奉行自己的爱好和平的外交政策，同一切愿意和我们友好的人民加强友谊，以巩固和平和安全。
    仅仅在这一年，苏联就把武装部队裁减了64万人，放弃了自己在芬兰波卡拉半岛的军事基地，提前撤出了自己在旅顺口的军队。苏联缔结了奥地利国家条约，这个国家走上了永久中立的道路，苏联又从奥地利领土上撤走了军队，同德意志联邦共和国建立了外交关系，还采取了其他一系列同样有效的巩固和平的措施。
    苏联同南斯拉夫恢复了友好关系，我们同它的相互关系曾经有很长一段时间处于不正常和紧张的状态。我们今后将继续发展我们对南斯拉夫的睦邻友好关系，扩大苏联和南斯拉夫之间的经济和文化联系。（经久不息的掌声）
    在这些措施中占有重要地位的是我们的访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗以及苏联和这些国家之间所达成的协议。
    在这次苏联最高苏维埃会议上讨论1956年国家预算时，我们大家一致表决同意把国防需要的开支比前一年缩减近一百亿卢布。
    而美国国防部长威尔逊最近却宣布，在新的预算年度中，用于维持美国武装部队的支出将再增加十亿美元，达到三百五十五亿美元的庞大数字。威尔逊还没有说出，除此之外，预算中还规定了一笔不少的钱用于其他的军事开支，像生产原子武器、囤积战略原料和向外国提供军事“援助”等。
    因此，如果说在我们方面已经有了以缓和国际紧张局势为目的的具体事例，那末在另一方面，就是在西方国家方面，遗憾的是我们看不到这种情形。相反，美国在增加军费。这个国家的领导人物在扩大侵略条约，他们当中有些人发表完全不是想加强“日内瓦精神”的好战声明。
    这样看来，是谁在加强日内瓦精神，是谁在破坏它呢？
    最后我想谈一谈关于共产党和工人党情报局——在西方称为康敏福姆——今后的存在这样一个问题。
    实在说，根本没有任何理由足以产生这样一个问题。但是，在印度的外国记者却老是问我们：
    你们为什么不取消康敏福姆？能不能停止共产党在其他国家的活动呢？
    其他的交谈者也向我们提出这样的问题。
    我们对这些人说：
    你们为什么不提议解散社会党国际呢？为什么不提议取消资本家的各种国际联盟呢？
    这样，我们的交谈者就没有话可以回答了。
    自然，共产主义的敌人是不喜欢康敏福姆的。但是，要知道，科学的共产主义作为一种学说是早在共产党和工人党情报局建立之前大约一百年就存在了的。在康敏福姆范围内的合作——这是主张马克思列宁主义，宣传一定的社会制度的共产党和工人党内部的事情。共产党代表工人阶级，表达和捍卫工人阶级的利益，人民群众的切身利益。
    共产主义的敌人不仅是不喜欢康敏福姆。他们更加不喜欢的是这种确定不移的事实：无坚不摧的共产主义学说一年比一年把世界各国越来越多的人们争取到自己的旗帜下来。（经久不息的掌声）
    苏联人民都记得，从前社会革命党、孟什维克和工人阶级的其他敌人曾经说，他们拥护苏维埃政权，但是他们只拥护不要布尔什维克的苏维埃政权。这些党派打算用这样的口号来欺骗人民，使人民同自己的领袖——伟大的列宁所创建的共产党分开。他们知道政权是可以改变的，而共产党不能改变。无法迫使共产党放弃保卫工人阶级的利益、人民的利益，因为共产党是工人阶级和劳动农民的真正领袖，是人民的领袖并且是人民的切身利益的代表者。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    一切国家的共产党都效法苏联共产党的榜样，把自己的全部活动同工人阶级的切身利益，同人民的利益紧密地联结起来。这是一切想永远压迫人民的人们所不高兴的。他们不喜欢工人阶级的国际团结，因而他们自然也就希望康敏福姆不再存在，但是这并不能由于他们决定。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    以上谈的就是我认为有必要比较详细谈谈的各种问题。
    最后，我相信最高苏维埃会赞同我们访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的结果，因为这次访问有助于巩固苏联人民同印度、缅甸和阿富汗人民的友谊和合作。而世界各国人民的友谊正是能够阻止另一次战争爆发的各国人民力量的强大源泉。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）
    代表同志们，请允许我在这个高高的讲台上再一次向伟大的印度人民、印度共和国政府和尼赫鲁总理先生本人表示我们衷心的感谢，（暴风雨般的掌声）向友好的缅甸联邦人民、他们的政府和缅甸总理吴努本人表示我们衷心的感谢，（暴风雨般的掌声）向友好的阿富汗人民、他们的政府和穆罕默德·达乌德汗首相本人表示我们衷心的感谢。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们热烈感谢在我们访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的时候这些国家千千万万人民对苏联、对我们伟大的人民所表现的殷勤招待、关怀和爱戴。（暴风雨般的掌声）我们衷心感谢我们曾经会晤的政治家和社会活动家、我们所到达的各邦各省的首长，因为我们每到一处都受到了最真诚和最热情的接待。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    世界各国人民伟大的友谊万岁！（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）
    强大和无畏的和平战士苏联人民万岁！（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）
    苏联历次胜利的鼓舞者和组织者伟大的苏联共产党万岁！（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声，全体起立）（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科三十日电）
