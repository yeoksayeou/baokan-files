    To meet the needs of the health departments in eliminating schistosomiasis, kala-azar, malaria, filariasis, and leprosy, the state-owned pharmaceutical factories under the Ministry of Light Industry plan to produce large quantities of more than a dozen medicines this year, including tartar emetic, sodium antimony gluconate, dapsone, and tetrachloroethylene.
    The more than a dozen medicines that various pharmaceutical factories plan to expand production of this year have all been proven to have good medical effects after testing. For example, the "Palaquin" medicine for treating malaria has been proven through clinical trials to be effective in patients within a few days of taking the medicine, and has few side effects.

    The total output value of state-owned pharmaceutical factories under the Ministry of Light Industry last year increased by 28% compared with 1954; the production of procaine penicillin, used to treat pneumonia, meningitis, and suppurative infectious diseases, increased by more than two times compared with 1954; and seven major products with a wide range of uses, such as the anti-inflammatory drug sulfathiazole, the antipyretic and analgesic phenacetin, and the nutritional drug glucose, all overfulfilled their annual production plans, increasing production by more than 10% compared with 1954.
    Last year, various pharmaceutical factories also successfully trial-produced more than 20 new medicines and medical devices. Sulfonamide and ephedrine drugs, which previously relied on imports, are now being produced in large quantities and are able to meet domestic needs. The foreign exchange saved last year from the production of sulfathiazole alone could build a modern hospital with more than 1,000 beds. (Xinhua News Agency)

    国营制药厂计划增产十几种药品
    轻工业部所属国营制药厂为了供应卫生部门消灭血吸虫病、黑热病、疟疾、血丝虫病和麻风病的需要，今年计划大量生产吐酒石、葡萄糖酸锑钠、氨苯砜、四氯乙烯等十几种药品。
    各制药厂今年计划扩大生产的十几种药品，都是经过试验后证明有良好医疗效果的。如治疗疟疾的“百乐君”药品经过临床试验，证明病人吃药以后一般在几天内就能见效，并且副作用很少。  （新华社）
    轻工业部所属各国营制药厂，去年的生产总值，比1954年增长了28％；治疗肺炎、脑膜炎和化脓性传染病的普鲁卡因青霉素，比1954年增加了两倍多；用途很广的消炎药品磺胺噻唑、解热止痛的非那西汀、营养药品葡萄糖等七种主要产品，也都超额完成年度生产计划，比1954年增产了10％以上。
    各制药厂去年还试制成功了20多种新的药品和医疗器械。过去依靠进口的磺胺类和麻黄素药品，现在已经大批生产，并且能够满足国内的需要。只是去年生产的磺胺类中的磺胺噻唑，节约的外汇就能建筑一所有一千多张床位的现代化医院。（新华社）
