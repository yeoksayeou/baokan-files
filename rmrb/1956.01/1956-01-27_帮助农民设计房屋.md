    Helping Farmers Design Houses
    With the continuous improvement of farmers' lives, many new houses are being built in the vast countryside every year. Most of these new houses still retain ancient architectural forms, with simple shapes, small doors and windows, and closed-off ventilation, which are neither economical nor practical, yet are very expensive to build.

    Recently, the Urban Construction Bureau of Jiangxi Province, acting on the suggestions of the masses, had the design personnel of its First Engineering Company design 11 types of house plans based on the climate, building materials and different household sizes in southern Jiangxi. Preliminary calculations show that each square meter only requires 14.16 yuan; and each person has an average of 16 square meters of usable area. They are continuing to research and improve.

    帮助农民设计房屋
    农民生活不断上升，广大农村中每年都有很多新建的房屋出现。这些新建的房屋，大部分还保留着古老的建筑形式，形状简陋，门窗矮小，空气闭塞，既不经济，又不适用，而造价却很高。
    最近，江西省城市建设局接受群众的建议，由这个局的第一工程公司设计人员按赣南的气候、建筑材料等条件和农民居住人口多少不同的情况，设计了11种类型房屋的图样。初步计算，每平方公尺只需要14.16元；每一人平均有16平方公尺的使用面积。他们还在继续研究改进。
