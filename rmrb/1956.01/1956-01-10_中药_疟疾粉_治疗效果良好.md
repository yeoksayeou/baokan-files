  　Traditional Chinese Medicine "Malaria Powder" Has Good Therapeutic Effect
　　The Ethnic Hospital of Luxi County in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, has achieved good results in treating malignant malaria and tertian malaria with the traditional Chinese medicine "Malaria Powder" in trials. Clinical experiments have shown that 32 patients have been completely cured, and some have not relapsed for more than seven months. There are also no side effects from taking this medicinal powder.
　　The "Malaria Powder" is a secret ancestral recipe made public by Zhou Meili, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner from Wanxian County, Sichuan Province. The Ministry of Health designated Yunnan, Hunan, and other places to conduct clinical trials at the beginning of last year. The raw materials for preparing this "Malaria Powder" can be purchased in rural areas all over China, and the preparation and use methods are very simple, and the cost is very low. According to the Luxi County Malaria Prevention and Control Station, it only costs one or two fen to cure a patient with malignant malaria or tertian malaria.

  　中药“疟疾粉”治疗效果良好
　　云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治区潞西县民族医院，试验用中药“疟疾粉”治疗恶性疟和间日疟效果良好。临床实验的结果，有32个患者已经全部治愈，有的已经有七个多月没有复发。服用这种药粉也没有副作用。　　“疟疾粉”是四川万县中医周美礼公开的祖传秘方、卫生部在去年年初曾指定由云南、湖南等地进行临床实验。配制这种“疟疾粉”的原料在我国各地农村都可买到，配制和使用方法都很简便，而且成本很低，据潞西县疟疾防治站计算，治好一个恶性疟或间日疟患者只需一、两分钱。　　（新华社）
