　　A Branch Struggling to Complete the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
　　Chen Jun

The call to complete the First Five-Year Plan in four years, through the efforts of the Communist Party branch, has become the practical action of all the employees of the firing workshop of the state-owned Guangzhou Cement Factory. On the first day of 1956, the three rotary kilns completed 101.7% of their plan.

The firing workshop is a major workshop in the Guangzhou Cement Factory, including five sections: crushing, raw materials, coal powder, firing, and clay mining. The success or failure of the production in this workshop has a decisive significance on whether the whole factory can complete the production plan; the work of other workshops and departments in the factory is also closely centered around the production process and requirements of the firing workshop. In the face of the glorious task—completing the First Five-Year Plan in four years—the responsibility of the firing workshop has become even heavier. The Party branch of this workshop stood at the forefront of this struggle, uniting and guiding the entire workshop to overcome difficulties and advance bravely.

As early as late November 1955, the Party branch discussed the issue of preparing for the production in 1956. At that time, although the whole factory had not yet put forward the call to strive to complete the First Five-Year Plan in four years, the branch had already realized that the production tasks in 1956 would definitely be higher than those in 1955. Moreover, in order to support the newly built cement factory, 60 workers of grade four and above would be transferred from the existing 140-plus technical workers in this workshop, which would further increase the difficulties in completing the production tasks. In order to meet the new tasks, the branch studied and analyzed the main problems in the workshop's production work, and decided to strengthen political and ideological leadership in four areas. These are: strengthening labor discipline, practicing strict economy, ensuring safe production, and giving full play to the responsibility and initiative of the section chiefs. The branch arranged the work, stipulating that each work should be combined with the actual situation to carry out ideological education, and mobilize the workers to put forward suggestions for improvement. For example, regarding the work of the section chiefs: for the entire workshop, the work of the section chiefs is a crucial link determining production. However, in the past, the section chiefs mostly only asked about production and did not ask about labor emulation. Even in production, the section chiefs were not responsible enough. When they discovered waste in production and slack labor discipline, or difficulties in production, they either ignored them or reached out to higher authorities for solutions. A small number of workers also lacked respect for the leadership of the section chiefs. The branch solved this problem from two aspects. On the one hand, combined with the waste phenomenon and losses caused by accidents in production over the past year, the section chiefs were educated to understand their responsibilities, what they should manage, and how to manage. On the other hand, the workers were educated to obey the command of the section chiefs, and the workers were mobilized to conduct bottom-up inspections, and to put forward criticisms and suggestions on the work of the section chiefs. The branch also suggested that the administrative leaders of the workshop should strengthen specific assistance to the section chiefs. In the past, a meeting of all section chiefs in the entire workshop was held once a week. When many section chiefs came together, just reporting the situation would take up a lot of time, and the problems of each section could not be discussed well, so that this kind of meeting could not produce the due effect. After research, the administrative aspect of the workshop has decided to spend one day a week in the future to specifically study the work of each section with each section.

In mid-December 1955, the whole factory began to deliberate on the issue of striving to complete the First Five-Year Plan in four years. The Party branch of the firing workshop held a meeting on December 20 to study how to mobilize the masses to achieve this task. Then, a general meeting of Party members was held to discuss issues such as carrying out propaganda and mobilization work and launching a rationalization proposal campaign. Afterwards, the resolution of the branch meeting was reported to all employees. In the middle of ten days, the branch carried out a series of tasks in a tense manner.

In terms of propaganda and mobilization work, the branch promoted the production enthusiasm of all employees by flexibly using methods such as report meetings and blackboards to publicize the high tide of the national agricultural collectivization movement and the bumper agricultural harvest in 1955. In the propaganda, it was also combined with current affairs at any time to carry out mobilization. When the news that Romania had completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and implemented the second price reduction was published in the newspaper, the Party branch used this fact to publicize the significance of our completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. After proposing to launch a labor emulation campaign, the branch carried out collectivism education. The branch also led the trade union to publish "Quick Reports" to broadcast various rationalization proposals and technical improvement achievements to each section in a timely manner.

In order to fully tap potential strength, the branch inspected the past work of rationalization proposals, and found that due to layer-by-layer review and delayed processing, the enthusiasm of workers to put forward rationalization proposals was greatly reduced. The group for reviewing rationalization proposals, jointly organized by the administration and the trade union, was also not responsible enough in its work. The branch decided to designate one member of the branch committee to participate in the group for reviewing rationalization proposals to strengthen the political leadership of this work. It urged the group for reviewing rationalization proposals to ensure that the suggestions put forward by the workers were studied and tested in a timely manner; the rationalization proposals that were successfully tested should be adopted immediately. After research by the workshop leadership, specific targets for completing the Five-Year Plan in four years, the key issues for improving production, the measures to be taken administratively, and the topics of rationalization proposals were put forward to all sections of the workshop and announced to each section. The branch called on Party members and members of the Communist Youth League to take the lead in studying and solving these key issues.

The branch also came forward to convene a forum on improving worker skills. At the forum, it was reflected that workers generally had an urgent desire to learn technology, but in the past, there was a lack of specific leadership for technology learning. At the meeting, the branch also emphasized that the production tasks in 1956 were heavy, and if the skills of workers could not be improved quickly and new technicians could not be trained, not only would the production tasks of this workshop not be completed, but also the task of supporting the new factory would not be completed. After discussion at the meeting, it was proposed to help each worker formulate a plan to learn technology, and in one or two years, each worker should strive to improve to several grades of technicians, and to draw up contracts for old workers to help new workers.

The branch inspected the situation of the labor emulation campaign, and found that there was still formalism in the labor emulation campaign. The trade union also lacked specific leadership over the labor emulation campaign, so it could not discover advanced experiences in a timely manner and promote them. There were also problems with the reward system. In the past, only the most outstanding achievements were rewarded, so only one of the six sections could receive a reward. This affected the enthusiasm of the workers. Now, it has been decided that in addition to rewarding model units, all those who exceed the production targets can receive corresponding rewards.

In late December 1955, discussions on how to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule were launched in each section and group. In ten days, the workers put forward 45 rationalization proposals on completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. For example, in order to adapt to the increase in production tasks in 1956, the coal powder section had to increase the supply of coal powder by one time. However, the existing three coal powder dryers had insufficient equipment capacity. In order to meet the new tasks, the workers actively studied and proposed suggestions for improving the coal powder machine equipment, increasing the coal powder output by one time. Then, it was discovered that the amount of coal powder flying was still very large. After research by the workers, this phenomenon was eliminated. Because the rationalization proposals were handled quickly, the enthusiasm of the workers was greatly encouraged.

Finally, the workshop convened a meeting of Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres and section chiefs of the workshop to discuss the requirements put forward by the leadership, the opinions of the departments on the workshop's production, and the workers' suggestions, unified their thinking, and preliminarily formulated the 1956 production plan and various measures.

For a long time, ring formation accidents have been the most serious threat to the production of rotary kilns. In late December 1955, the No. 1 kiln had another ring formation accident, which affected the decline in output. In order to ensure the production in 1956 and to ensure that the kiln would not be shut down for repairs, the workers thought of many ways. Finally, the ring formation accident was solved by changing the batching and coal powder composition. As a result, the output on December 31 began to rise, increasing by 19.56% compared to the 30th, and on January 1, 1956, it increased by 7.11% compared to the previous day, breaking through the operation plan for that day.

The Party branch in the firing workshop is playing its role as a fortress in the struggle to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

　　为提早完成五年计划而斗争的一个支部
    陈濬
    争取四年里完成第一个五年计划的号召，经过共产党支部的努力，已经成为国营广州水泥厂烧成车间全体职工的实际行动。1956年的第一天，三台回转窑完成计划101.7％。
    烧成车间是广州水泥厂的一个主要车间，包括碎石、生料、煤粉、烧成、采泥等五个工段。这个车间的生产进行得好坏，对于全厂能不能完成生产计划是具有决定性意义的；全厂其他的车间和科室工作，也都是紧紧围绕着烧成车间的生产过程和要求，进行工作。在光荣的任务——四年里完成第一个五年计划的面前，更加加重了烧成车间的责任。这个车间的党支部就站到了这一个斗争的最前列，团结和引导着全车间，克服困难，勇敢前进。
    早在1955年11月下旬，党支部就讨论了为1956年的生产进行准备的问题。当时，全厂虽然还没有提出争取四年里完成第一个五年计划的号召，但支部已经认识到1956年的生产任务，一定会比1955年的要求更高，并且为了支援新建的水泥厂，将要从这个车间现有的140多个技术工人中，调出四级以上的工人60个，这就更加增加了完成生产任务中的困难。支部为了迎接新的任务，研究和分析了车间生产工作上的主要问题，支部决定要在四件工作上，加强政治思想领导。这就是：加强劳动纪律、厉行节约、搞好安全生产和发挥工段长的责任心和积极性。支部安排了工作，规定每一个工作，都要结合实际情况，进行思想教育，并发动工人，提出改进的意见。比如关于工段长的工作：对于整个车间来说，工段长的工作是决定生产的一个重要环节。但是，过去工段长多是只问生产，不问劳动竞赛。就是在生产上，工段长也是不够负责的，发现了生产中的浪费和劳动纪律松弛等现象、生产中的困难，不是不管，就是向上级伸手要办法。少数工人对工段长的领导也不够尊重。支部就从两方面来解决这个问题，一方面结合一年来生产中的浪费现象和事故所造成的损失，教育工段长认识自己的职责，应当管些什么，怎样管理；另一方面，对工人进行了服从工段长指挥的教育，并且发动工人进行自下而上的检查，对工段长的工作提出批评和建议。支部又建议车间的行政领导上对工段长要加强具体帮助。过去，每星期开一次全车间工段长的会议，很多工段长到一起，光是汇报情况，就会占去很长时间，不能够很好地讨论各工段的问题，使这种会议不能发生应有的作用。车间的行政方面经过研究，已经决定以后每星期要用一天的时间，分别同各工段具体研究每个工段的工作。
    1955年12月中旬，全厂开始酝酿争取四年里完成第一个五年计划的问题。烧成车间的党支部，在12月20日开会研究了怎样发动群众，实现这个任务。接着又召开了党员大会，讨论了开展宣传鼓动工作，开展合理化建议运动等问题。以后，又向全体职工报告了支部大会的决议。在十几天中间，支部紧张地进行了一系列的工作。
    在宣传鼓动工作方面，支部通过灵活地采用报告会和黑板报等方法宣传了全国农业合作化运动的高潮和1955年农业大丰收的情况，鼓励全体职工的生产情绪。在宣传中，又随时结合时事，进行鼓动。报上发表了罗马尼亚提前完成五年计划，又实行了第二次降低物价的消息，党支部就通过这个事实来宣传我们提前完成第一个五年计划的意义。在提出开展劳动竞赛以后，支部又进行了集体主义的教育。支部还领导工会，出版“快报”，把各种合理化建议和技术改进的成绩，及时广播给各个工段。　　为了充分挖掘潜在力量，支部检查了过去合理化建议的工作，发现由于层层审查，拖延不处理，大大降低了工人提合理化建议的积极性。由行政和工会联合组织的审查合理化建议的小组，工作也不够负责。支部决定指定支部委员一人，参加审查合理化建议小组，加强对这一工作的政治领导。督促审查合理化建议小组，保证及时研究和试验工人提出的建议；对于试验成功的合理化建议，应当马上采用。又经过车间领导上的研究，向全车间各工段提出了四年里完成五年计划的具体指标、现在提高生产的关键问题、行政上准备采取的措施以及合理化建议的课题，向各工段公布。支部就号召党员、团员带头研究和解决这些关键问题。
      支部又出面召开了关于提高工人技术的座谈会。在座谈会上，反映出工人普遍要求学习技术的迫切情绪，但是，过去对技术学习缺乏具体领导。会上，支部又强调指出了1956年生产任务繁重，如果不能很快提高工人技术和培养新的技工，不但不能完成本车间的生产任务，也将不能完成支援新建厂的任务。经过会议的讨论，提出了要帮助每个工人制定学习技术的计划，在一年两年的时间里，每个工人要争取提高到几级技工，订出老工人帮助新工人的合同。
    支部检查了劳动竞赛的情况，发现了劳动竞赛中还存在着形式主义的现象。工会对劳动竞赛也缺乏具体领导，因而不能及时地发现先进经验，并加以推广。在奖励制度上，也有问题。过去只奖励成绩最突出的，因此六个工段只有一个工段能得到奖励。这就影响到工人的积极性。现在，决定除了奖励模范的单位以外，凡是超过生产指标的都可以得到相应的奖励。
      在1955年12月下旬，各工段各小组展开了关于如何提早完成五年计划问题的讨论。十天里，工人们就提出了45项关于提早完成五年计划的合理化建议。例如煤粉工段，为了适应1956年生产任务的提高，必须增加煤粉的供应量一倍。可是现有的三台煤粉干燥机，设备能力不足。为了迎接新的任务，工人们积极钻研，提出了改进煤粉机的装置的建议，提高了煤粉产量一倍。接着又发现了煤粉的飞散量还很大，又经过工人的研究，消除了这种现象。由于合理化建议处理得迅速，大大鼓舞了工人的积极性。
    最后车间又召开了车间的党、政、工、团的干部和工段长的会议，根据领导上提出的要求，科室对车间生产的意见、工人的建议，进行了讨论，统一了思想，初步订出1956年的生产计划和各项措施。
    长期以来，结圈事故，对于回转窑的生产是最严重的威胁。1955年12月下旬第一号窑又发生了结圈事故，影响产量下降。工人们为了保证1956年的生产，保证不停窑修理，想了好多办法。最后用改变配料和煤粉成分等办法，解决了结圈事故。使得12月31日的产量开始上升，比30日增加19.56％，1956年1月1日又比前一天增加了7.11％，突破了这一天的作业计划。
    党在烧成车间的支部，在提早完成第一个五年计划的斗争里，发挥着自己的堡垒作用。
