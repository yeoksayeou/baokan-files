    Cultivate Advanced Production Teams
    Yi Huai
    In Beijing, there is a famous Zhang Baifa steel bar young shock brigade. After Zhang Baifa went abroad in the summer of 1955, the production of this young shock brigade was not affected by the departure of the captain. The deputy captain, Yang Fulin, led the team of young people, boldly accepting tasks just as Zhang Baifa had done, and continuously increasing labor productivity, with the number of completed tasks increasing day by day. At the same time, they maintained a humble and simple style, voluntarily living in the worst places, and some even insisted on working while ill.
    The Yi Shijuan production team of the Shanghai No. 2 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory was not like this. In 1955, this team failed to complete its plan for five months. This team was originally a national model team for promoting the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method." However, when the factory implemented the doffing cleaning work schedule, the Yi Shijuan production team fell behind other production teams. The reason was that Yi Shijuan had gone out to attend meetings for six months in total last year. Yi Shijuan is an excellent Communist Party member and a well-known labor model with high prestige among the masses. When she was in the factory, she could manage the team's work very well, but when she was away, no one could manage the team. Two members of the team (one of whom was also the trade union group leader) were arrogant, detached from the masses, and only listened to Yi Shijuan. The implementation of the doffing cleaning work schedule lagged behind other groups because these two people disagreed.
    Production teams are units that directly organize the masses to work in factories and mines. Cultivating advanced production teams plays a significant role in improving labor productivity and ensuring the completion of various national plan targets. In many advanced production teams, there are individual outstanding advanced producers or labor models, and many advanced production teams have grown up under the leadership and influence of these advanced figures. Party organizations and trade unions should be very concerned about cultivating these advanced figures. Cultivating advanced figures is not only of great benefit to consolidating and promoting the work of advanced production teams, but also can drive the majority of employees to better complete production plans through these advanced figures. However, Party organizations and trade unions must not only cultivate advanced figures and abandon the cultivation of production teams. Only in this way can every advanced production team be like the Zhang Baifa youth shock brigade, not suffering losses in work due to the departure of individual advanced members, and avoid repeating the lessons of the Yi Shijuan team.

    培养先进生产小组
    易槐
    北京市有一个有名的张百发钢筋工青年突击队。1955年夏天，张百发出国后，这个青年突击队并没有因为队长的离开而使生产受到影响。副队长杨福林领导着全队青年，像张百发在的时候一样，大胆地接受任务，并且不断地提高劳动生产率，完成任务的数字一天高过一天。同时他们还保持着谦逊朴实的作风，自愿住最坏的地方，有些人还带病坚持工作。
    国营上海第二棉纺织厂裔式娟生产小组却不是这样。在1955年中，这个小组有五个月没有完成计划。这个小组原是推行“郝建秀工作法”的全国模范组。可是，当厂里推行落纱清洁工作进度表的时候，裔式娟生产小组却落在别的生产小组的后面。原因是去年裔式娟先后出去开了六个月的会。裔式娟是优秀的共产党员和有名的劳动模范，在群众中的威信很高，她在厂里的时候，就能很好地掌握小组工作，当她一出去后，就没有人能掌握这个小组。这个小组里有两个团员（其中一个还是工会小组长）自高自大，脱离群众，只听裔式娟一个人的话。落纱清洁工作进度表的推行就因为这两个人不同意而落在别的组的后面。
    生产小组，在厂矿中是直接组织群众进行劳动的单位。培养先进生产小组，对于提高劳动生产率，保证完成国家计划的各种指标有很大的作用。许多先进生产小组中，都有个别比较突出的先进生产者或劳动模范，有许多先进生产小组就是在这些先进人物的带动和影响下生长起来的。党组织和工会都应该十分关心培养这些先进人物，培养好先进人物不但对巩固和推动先进生产小组的工作有很大好处，而且可以通过这些先进人物来带动广大职工更好地完成生产计划。但是，党组织和工会决不能因此只培养先进人物，而放弃了对生产小组的培养。只有这样，才能使每一个先进生产小组都能像张百发青年突击队一样，不因个别先进分子的去留而使工作遭受损失，不致于重复裔式娟小组的教训。
