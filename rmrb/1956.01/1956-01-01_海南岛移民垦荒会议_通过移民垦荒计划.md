    Hainan Island Immigration Land Reclamation Conference
    Approves Immigration Land Reclamation Plan
    Guangdong Province will relocate people from the mainland to Hainan Island for land reclamation. The Hainan Region and 13 counties have established immigration land reclamation offices to actively carry out various preparatory tasks.
    The work plan for welcoming immigrants to reclaim land was approved at the Hainan Region's First Immigration Land Reclamation Conference, which closed on the 27th.
    In the next two years, 50,000 people from mainland Guangdong will establish 260 advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives on Hainan Island, reclaiming 500,000 mu of land. This winter and next spring, 5,000 people from the Eastern Guangdong Region and Guangzhou City will arrive on Hainan Island. Among them, 3,000 will participate in existing agricultural producers' cooperatives, and 2,000 are preparing to establish 40 advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives.
