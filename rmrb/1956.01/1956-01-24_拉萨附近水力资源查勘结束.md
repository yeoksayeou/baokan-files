    Survey of Water Resources Near Lhasa Completed
    The Tibet Engineering Survey Team recently produced the "Survey Report on Water Resources Near Lhasa." The report provides detailed descriptions of water resources at three locations: the Yangbajing River, a tributary of the Lhasa River; the Xian Duo area near the Lhasa River in the eastern suburbs of Lhasa; and Duo Di in the northeast. The Yangbajing River has a potential power generation capacity of 90,000 kilowatts, with good reservoir sites upstream. The hydrological, hydrological, geological and other conditions in Xian Duo and Duo Di are suitable for building small power stations. The expanded Lhasa Hydropower Station and the newly established hydropower station will utilize these two water resources. The surveying and preliminary design work for these two hydropower stations has been completed. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    拉萨附近水力资源查勘结束
    西藏工程勘察队最近作出了“拉萨附近水力资源查勘报告”。报告对拉萨河支流羊八井河、拉萨市东郊拉萨河献多附近、东北部夺地等3处水力资源作了详细说明。羊八井河蕴藏的发电能力有90，000瓩，上游有良好的水库地址。献多、夺地两处的水力、水文、地质等条件，都适合建立小型发电站。扩建的拉萨水电站和新建立的水力发电站将利用这两处水力资源。这两处水电站的测量、初步设计工作已经完成。　（据新华社讯）
