The Ministry of Education issued a notice on student work during the winter vacation on the 20th. The notice said that the focus of student activities during this winter vacation should be on publicizing and supporting the socialist transformation movement, so that students can receive socialist education through participating in such practical activities. Teachers, especially those in rural schools, should also be mobilized to participate in these activities; students should also actively participate in literacy campaigns, the elimination of the "four pests," and other social welfare activities during the winter vacation.

The notice pointed out that before the winter vacation, primary and secondary schools, normal schools, and schools for workers and peasants should report to students on the Party's principles and policies on the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, as well as the current development of the movement. At the same time, they should also guide students on how to carry out winter vacation activities around these tasks.
