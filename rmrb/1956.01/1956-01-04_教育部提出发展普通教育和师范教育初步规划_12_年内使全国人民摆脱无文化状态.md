Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd: The Ministry of Education recently put forward preliminary ideas for a 12-year plan for the development of general education and teacher education, and determined the guiding principles and tasks for the work in 1956. The plan focuses on completing the tasks of eliminating illiteracy, universalizing compulsory education, cultivating socialist intellectuals, and educating the people and the new generation with socialism and communism. It requires that within 12 years, all people in the country, regardless of gender or age, receive socialist education and be freed from illiteracy, in order to meet the needs of national socialist construction.

According to this plan, efforts will be made to complete the tasks of the First Five-Year Plan in eliminating illiteracy and in primary, junior high, and secondary normal education one year ahead of schedule. Senior high school and higher normal education will strive to exceed the 1956 tasks.

Regarding the elimination of illiteracy, the plan requires that illiteracy among cadres in government agencies and organizations be basically eliminated within two years, illiteracy among workers and staff be basically eliminated within three years, and illiteracy among farmers and urban residents aged 14 to 50 be basically eliminated within seven years.

Regarding the universalization of compulsory education, the plan requires that junior high school compulsory education be basically universalized in major and industrial cities within seven years, complete primary school education be basically universalized in general towns and relatively well-off rural areas, and elementary primary school education be basically universalized in less well-off rural areas. During the period of the Third Five-Year Plan, junior high school education will be basically universalized in large and medium-sized cities and industrial cities across the country, and complete primary school education will be universalized in general areas.

In the next 12 years, the supply of teachers for middle and primary schools is required to be gradually provided by graduates of the corresponding levels of normal schools. All teachers in secondary and primary schools should be basically qualified in terms of quality. Starting in 1956, normal schools at all levels will increase their enrollment tasks significantly compared to the original plan. In addition to vigorously developing normal schools at all levels, the methods of short-term normal training courses or short-term normal schools will also be adopted to solve the shortage of teachers in secondary and primary schools.

　　教育部提出发展普通教育和师范教育初步规划
　　12年内使全国人民摆脱无文化状态
    据新华社2日讯　教育部最近提出了今后12年普通教育和师范教育事业规划的初步意见，并确定了1956年工作的方针、任务。规划中着重地对完成扫除文盲工作，普及义务教育，培养社会主义知识分子，以及用社会主义、共产主义教育人民群众和新生一代等四项任务，作了详尽的考虑，要求在12年内使全国人民不分男女老幼都受到社会主义教育，摆脱无文化状态，以适应国家社会主义建设的需要。
    根据这个规划，将争取提前一年完成第一个五年计划在扫除文盲和小学、初中、中等师范教育等方面的任务，高中和高等师范教育争取超额完成1956年的任务。
    关于扫除文盲工作，规划要求在两年内基本上扫除机关团体干部中的文盲，三年内基本上扫除职工中的文盲，七年内基本上扫除全国14岁到50岁农民和市民中的文盲。
    关于普及义务教育的问题，规划要求七年内，在主要的大城市和工业城市基本上普及初中义务教育，在一般城镇和条件较好的农村基本上普及完全小学教育，在条件较差的农村基本上普及初级小学教育。到第三个五年计划期间，在全国大、中城市和工业城市基本上普及初中教育，在一般地区普及完全小学教育。
    在今后的12年内，要求中、小学的师资逐步做到以相应的各级师范学校的毕业生来供应。中等和初等学校所有教师在质量上基本合格。从1956年开始，各级师范学校要比原计划增加大量的招生任务。除大力发展各级师范学校外，还要采取速成师范专修科或速成师范学校的办法，以解决中等和初等学校师资缺额问题。
