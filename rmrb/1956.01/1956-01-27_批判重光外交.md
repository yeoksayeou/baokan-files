Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 25th: The latest issue of the Japanese magazine "Chuo Koron" published the opinions of Japanese Socialist Party Diet members Tadao Sata and Masaru Tsunei on Japan's current foreign policy under the title "Criticizing the Shigemitsu Diplomacy." They expressed these opinions at a symposium held by the "Chuo Koron" magazine.

     On the issue of Japan's relations with China, Tadao Sata said: "We should clearly state that the legitimate Chinese government is mainland China." He pointed out that on the issue of recognizing China, "Japan must not follow the United States but must move forward independently."
     Sata pointed out that the United States has made various interfering remarks regarding Japan's relations with China, "which is very abhorrent." Sata cited the example that the embargo strictly implemented with the United States as the center is the fundamental reason why Japan and China cannot conduct large-scale economic exchanges. The US Ambassador to Japan also protested and questioned the Japanese government in December last year regarding the economic and cultural exchange activities between non-governmental organizations in Japan and China. We believe that "these matters themselves are interference in Japan's internal affairs and diplomacy." Masaru Tsunei said that the Socialist Party, even before unification, did not approve of the "peace treaty" between Japan and the Chiang Kai-shek group, and after unification, it clearly stated that it would restore diplomatic relations with China. He pointed out that Japan's relations with China "cannot be allowed to forever act based on the United States' approval."
     Talking about the negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union to restore diplomatic relations, Sata said that from the perspective of easing international tensions and promoting peaceful diplomacy, Japan should end the state of war with the Soviet Union and conclude a peace treaty, which is the urgent hope of the Japanese people. However, Prime Minister Hatoyama has not been able to objectively analyze the world situation and correctly consider the negotiation direction. Masaru Tsunei said that Hatoyama seems not to have changed his view of adjusting diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union as soon as possible, but it is doubtful whether this view can be implemented within the Liberal Democratic Party.
     The two congressmen also talked about Japan's failure to join the United Nations. Sata pointed out: "This is entirely the result of blindly following the United States." He believes that the lack of progress in Japan's restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China is also a major reason. Sata said that if Japan could cooperate more closely with India, Burma, and Indonesia, and receive the active support of Asian and African countries centered on these countries, this would not have happened.

     “批判重光外交”
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：最新一期的日本“中央公论”杂志在“批判重光外交”的标题下，刊载了日本社会党国会议员佐多忠隆和曾祢益两人对日本现行外交政策的意见。他们是在“中央公论”杂志社主持举行的座谈会上发表这些意见的。
    在日本同中国的关系的问题上，佐多忠隆说：“我们应该明确表示，正统的中国政权是大陆中国。”他指出：在承认中国的问题上，“日本必须不追随美国而必须独自前进”。
    佐多指出，在日本同中国的关系上，美国说了种种干涉的话，“这是非常可恶的”。佐多举例说，以美国为中心所严格实行的禁运，是使日本和中国不可能进行大规模经济交流的基本原因。美国驻日大使还曾在去年12月对日中两国民间团体之间进行的经济、文化交流的活动，向日本政府提出抗议和质问。我们认为“这些事情本身就是对日本内政和外交的干涉”。曾祢益说，社会党在未统一以前就不赞成日本同蒋介石集团之间的“和约”，而在统一后，明确表示要同中国恢复邦交。他指出，对于日本同中国的关系是“不能允许永远看美国的眼色行事的”。
    谈到日本同苏联恢复邦交的谈判时，佐多说，从缓和国际紧张局势，推进和平外交着眼，日本应该和苏联结束战争状态，并且缔结和约，这是日本人民迫切的希望。但是，首相鸠山并没有能够非常客观地分析世界局势，正确地考虑谈判方针。曾祢益说，鸠山似乎没有改变尽快同苏联调整邦交的主张，但是这一主张能否在自由民主党内部贯彻是很值得怀疑的。
    这两位议员还谈到日本未能加入联合国的问题。佐多指出：“这完全是一味追随美国的结果”。他认为，日本在同苏联、中国恢复邦交方面没有进展也是很大的原因。佐多说，如果日本能够和印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚更紧密地合作，受到以这些国家为中心的亚、非各国的积极支持，就不会产生这种事情。
