Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum: Sudanese Prime Minister Ismail al-Azhari announced in a joint session of the Sudanese Parliament on the 1st that Britain and Egypt had recognized Sudan's independence. The Speaker of the House of Representatives read out the documents of British and Egyptian recognition of Sudan's independence.

    With this, Sudan officially became an independent republic, ending the "condominium" of Britain and Egypt since 1899 in this African country of approximately nine million people. The parliament had already passed the interim constitution of Sudan on December 31.

    After the documents of British and Egyptian recognition of Sudan's independence were read out, the five-member committee temporarily exercising the functions of the head of state was sworn in. Subsequently, they and all members of parliament went to the Governor-General's residence, which had previously served as the residence of the British Governor-General, and lowered the flags of Britain and Egypt there, raising the flag of the Republic of Sudan, which consists of horizontal stripes of blue, yellow, and green.

    More than one hundred thousand Sudanese people gathered in the square in front of the Governor-General's residence, cheering for this significant day that they had won through long and resolute struggle.

    According to foreign news agencies, France, West Germany, Greece, Turkey, Pakistan, Libya, and Iraq had already recognized the newly established Republic of Sudan on the 1st.

    非洲的苏丹共和国成立
    据新华社讯　喀土穆消息：苏丹总理伊斯梅尔·阿扎里1日在苏丹议会两院联席会议上宣布，英国和埃及承认了苏丹的独立。众议院议长宣读了英埃两国承认苏丹独立的文件。
    至此，苏丹正式成为独立的共和国，在这个约九百万人口的非洲国家中，结束了英国和埃及从1899年以来的“共管”。议会已在12月31日通过了苏丹临时宪法。
    在宣读了英埃两国承认苏丹独立的文件以后，暂行国家元首职权的五人委员会宣誓就职。接着，他们和全体议员前往过去作为英国总督官邸的总督府，并且在那里降下英国和埃及的国旗，升起了由蓝、黄、绿三色横条组成的苏丹共和国国旗。
    十万多苏丹人民聚集在总督府前广场上，欢呼他们经过长期坚决斗争才争取得来的这个有意义的日子。
    据外国通讯社报道，法国、西德、希腊、土耳其、巴基斯坦、利比亚和伊拉克已经在1日承认了新成立的苏丹共和国。
