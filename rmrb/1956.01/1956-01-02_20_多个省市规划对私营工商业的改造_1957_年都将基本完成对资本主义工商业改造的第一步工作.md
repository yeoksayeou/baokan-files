Xinhua News Agency, January 1st: More than 20 provinces and cities across the country will basically complete the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, mainly through the form of whole-industry public-private partnerships, in 1957. This is a resolution made by the local CCP organizations and some local People's Congresses in various provinces and cities since December 1955 at relevant meetings.

Shanghai will basically complete the task of implementing public-private partnerships by industry in private industrial and commercial enterprises and the collectivization of small merchants and peddlers, as well as distribution and agency sales, within two years. Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan and other cities, as well as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Jilin and other provinces, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have all determined that capitalist industry and commerce will achieve public-private partnerships by industry in 1957, and the public-private partnerships of most major industries will be completed in 1956. Other small merchants and peddlers will also be basically transformed through collectivization and other forms by the end of 1957. For example, in Hunan Province, the output value of public-private joint ventures in 1956 will account for more than 80% of the total output value of the original private factories; the number of capitalist shops and rural small merchants and peddlers transformed through public-private joint ventures and cooperative organizations is required to reach 75%. In Jiangxi Province, the output value of public-private joint venture industries in 1956 will develop to account for more than 91% of the province's total output value of capitalist industry. In addition, Henan, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Guangxi and other provinces have determined that they will basically complete the first step of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in 1956.

These plans are formulated based on the central government's spirit of carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and the specific conditions of industry and commerce in various regions. The local CCP organizations in various provinces and cities, at various meetings held successively, also pointed out the issues that should be paid attention to in the transformation of private industry and commerce, according to local characteristics. For example, the Beijing Municipal Party Member Cadre Meeting proposed that in the process of socialist transformation, not only should we not reduce varieties and specifications and lower quality for the sake of management convenience and pursuit of mass production, but we should also actively increase new varieties and specifications and improve quality, especially for some famous high-level manual skills in Beijing, we must never rudely change or cancel them. The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that special attention should be paid to the work arrangements for workers and staff of minority nationalities in the transformation.

　　20多个省市规划对私营工商业的改造
    1957年都将基本完成对资本主义工商业改造的第一步工作
    据新华社1日讯　全国20多个省、市都将在1957年基本上完成对资本主义工商业以全行业公私合营为主要形式的社会主义改造工作，这是1955年12月份以来各省、市中共组织以及部分地区的人民代表大会在召开有关的会议上做出的决议。
    上海市将在两年内基本上完成私营工商业按行业实行公私合营和小商小贩实行合作化以及经销、代销的任务。北京、天津、武汉等市和江苏、浙江、山东、安徽、湖南、湖北、四川、广东、江西、辽宁、吉林等省以及内蒙古自治区，都确定在1957年将资本主义工商业按行业实现公私合营，而绝大多数主要行业的公私合营将在1956年完成。其他小商小贩也将在1957年底以前通过合作化和其他形式基本上改造完毕。如湖南省1956年实现公私合营工厂的产值将占原有私营工厂总产值的80％以上；通过公私合营和合作组织改造的资本主义商店和农村小商小贩的户数要求达到75％。江西省在1956年公私合营工业的产值将发展到占全省资本主义工业总产值的91％以上。此外，河南、陕西、青海、广西等省确定在1956年就要基本上完成对资本主义工商业社会主义改造的第一步工作。
    这些规划都是根据中央对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的精神，和各地工商业的具体情况制定的。中共各省、市地方组织在先后举行的各种会议上，还根据当地的特点，指出了在对私营工商业改造中应该注意的问题。如北京市党员干部会议就提出了在社会主义改造过程中，不仅不应该只是为了管理方便，追求大量生产而减少品种、规格和降低质量，而且还应该积极增加新的品种规格和提高质量，特别是对北京市一些著名的高级手工技艺，绝不能粗暴地加以改变或取消。中共青海省委员会指出，在改造中应当特别注意对少数民族工人、职员的工作安排。
