　　Learn from the Soviet People's Spirit of Hard Struggle in Building Socialism
　　Zifan
　　The book "Learning from the Soviet People's Spirit of Hard Struggle in Building the Motherland," compiled by the Propaganda Department of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association General Headquarters (published by the Shidai Publishing House), introduces the arduous struggles of the Soviet people in realizing the first Five-Year Plan through many construction examples. These examples are of great educational and inspiring significance to the Chinese people who are striving to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
　　At that time, although the Soviet Union was surrounded by capitalism, and despite the numerous difficulties, lack of funds and talents, and poor technical and material conditions, the heroic Soviet people still completed the first Soviet Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in four years and three months.
　　How was the first Soviet Five-Year Plan successfully completed?
　　At the beginning of Soviet socialist industrialization, the people of the whole country, with the selfless spirit of "willing to bear sacrifices" as instructed by Stalin, waged tireless struggles against difficulties. In order to accumulate funds, the people of the whole country actively responded to the Party's call, vigorously implemented streamlining and savings, and eliminated all non-essential expenditures. In 1928, merely seven central-level organizations reduced their staff by approximately 3,300 people. During the first Five-Year Plan, administrative expenses were reduced to only 5% of the total national expenditure. Since 1929, a system of rationing food was also generally implemented, issuing different amounts of ration coupons based on the nature of each person's work and precise calculations. This system was implemented until the beginning of 1935. People paid meticulous attention to saving, even returning worn-out old rubber shoes when buying new ones. Thrift became a national movement in the Soviet Union. The funds accumulated through savings at that time were used to build many large enterprises such as the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, the Turkestan-Siberian Railway, and the Stalingrad Tractor Factory.
　　The establishment of the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Plant in Siberia and the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Plant in the Urals is a prime example. They are the two main components of the world-renowned Ural-Kuznetsk Combine, built more than two thousand kilometers apart in the east and west, respectively, connected by railway lines as a powerful transportation belt, forming a whole of coal and steel base. Such a project was unprecedented in world history.
　　To build this huge joint enterprise, the people of the whole country gave tremendous support. Large numbers of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members came to the construction site. In 1929, 66,000 young people participated in the construction of this joint enterprise. At that time, in all the factories producing equipment for this project, Communist Youth League shock brigades named specifically after "U.K.K." (the Russian abbreviation for the joint company) were established.
　　The severe winter did not stop the progress of the project. When excavators were unable to cope with the frozen earth, the young people picked up iron hoes to dig the soil. The workers overcame the Siberian winter of minus 50 degrees Celsius. Once, the soil of the passage of the charging car of the iron furnace collapsed, and several workers immediately rushed up and used their bodies to block the falling large clods of soil, rescuing their comrades.
　　Regarding the hard struggle of the workers at that time, Balkin, the chief engineer of the Kuznetsk construction project, recalled: "Working day and night... There was never anyone who deserted halfway. Everyone was an activist, a fighter." Just as he said, this project "in terms of its period, environment, and mainly in terms of the methods and ways of creation, is unprecedented in industrial history. From beginning to end, it has a revolutionary spirit!"
　　Under the slogan of "fighting for grain is fighting for socialism," Soviet peasants economized on food and clothing, thriftily concentrating the best grains and other agricultural products to supply the cities, supply industry, and exchange them abroad for the machinery and equipment most needed for national construction. Advanced collective farm members formed shock brigades, striving to increase grain production for the country. After increasing production, they more actively delivered public grain, ensuring the progress of socialist construction. For example, in 1930, the "Road to Socialism" collective farm completed its plan to sell grain to the state in September, totaling 3,678,000 catties. On September 20, in order to celebrate the collective farmers' conference in the district, they sold an additional 500,000 catties of grain to the state. In addition, in order to strengthen national defense construction, the farm members sold another 700,000 catties of grain to the state. The great Gorky wrote in a letter to a peasant correspondent: "Pay more grain, this grain will turn into machines, shoes and socks, clothes, good houses--not those dull wooden houses, good schools and children's nurseries, good roads, to return to you; your grain will return to you a hundredfold..." As a matter of fact, after the successful construction of the first Five-Year Plan, the lives of Soviet peasants became richer day by day.
　　Liberated Soviet women also worked for socialism just like men. The story of Angelina, the first female tractor driver in the Soviet Union, is world-renowned. When she first drove a tractor, she encountered many difficulties and was even ridiculed, saying, "It's not women who drive tractors, but tractors that drive women!" But she and her girlfriends ignored these sarcasms and finally learned the driving techniques. According to her, they strived to figure out the cause of each problem and often studied the things in the tractor textbook with a young technician late at night. As a result, their team became one of the best tractor teams in the entire Soviet Union. Angelina also issued a call for 100,000 women to drive tractors, but 200,000 women responded to her.
　　Soviet youth are the main force in building socialism, and they are always active at the forefront of all fronts. Just look at the Komsomolsk-on-Amur city in Siberia to understand the infinite power of Soviet youth in building a new life. At that time, this was just a small village of about 30 households. To build a "Komsomol City" here was a "groundbreaking" task, and everything had to be learned and done from scratch. For example, Soviet hero, legless flying general Maresiev, had worked as a lumberjack, bricklayer, marine mechanic, and lathe operator when he participated in this construction. As soon as they arrived here, they first attacked the great forest, felling trees to solve the problem of housing for themselves. One day, while completing their daily plan, they killed 153 poisonous snakes. Countless mosquitoes thinned them, but did not weaken the fiery enthusiasm of the Komsomol members. The difficulties were endless, but they regarded the construction site as a battlefield, and no difficulty could stump them. A new city appeared in the Soviet Far East after a short period of three years.
　　The Soviet people fully understood the true meaning that labor is their most personal cause, because they knew that happiness can never be obtained without labor. It was with full confidence in the future victory and the spirit of hard work in the present that they were able to build a prosperous and happy socialist society. All of this is as the poet Mayakovsky pointed out as early as 1929:
　　"Because there are such people in the Soviet land."
　　What the Soviet people can do, our people can certainly do. Because there are such people in our country too!

　　学习苏联人民建设社会主义的艰苦奋斗精神
    子凡
    中苏友好协会总会宣传部编的名为“学习苏联人民建设祖国的艰苦奋斗的精神”的书（时代出版社出版）中，通过许多的建设实例，介绍了苏联人民在实现第一个五年计划时的艰苦奋斗的情形。这些实例，对于正在为争取提前完成第一个五年计划而奋斗的我国人民，是有着很大的教育和鼓舞作用的。
    当时，尽管苏联处在资本主义包围的情况下，尽管面临重重困难，缺乏资金和人材，技术和物质条件很差；但是英雄的苏联人民仍然在四年零三个月的时间内提前完成了苏联第一个五年计划。
    苏联第一个五年计划是怎样胜利完成的呢？
    苏联社会主义工业化一开始，全国人民就都以斯大林所指示的那种“甘愿担受牺牲”的忘我精神，向困难进行不倦的斗争。为了积累资金，全国人民积极响应党的号召，大力实行精简节约，杜绝一切非绝对必要的开支。1928年，仅七个中央一级的机关，在缩减编制方面，就缩减了约3，300人，第一个五年计划期间，行政费减少到只占全国总支出的5％。自1929年起还普遍实行了粮食定量供应制度，根据每个人的劳动性质和精确的计算，发给不同数量的配售证，这个制度一直实行到1935年初。人们无微不至地注意节约，甚至在购买新胶鞋时还交回穿坏了的旧胶鞋。节约成为苏联全民的运动，当时由于节约所积累起来的资金，就建立起了第聂伯水电站、土西铁路、斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂等许多巨大的企业。
    西伯利亚的库兹涅茨克钢铁工厂和乌拉尔的马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁工厂的建立是一个最好的例证。它们是世界闻名的乌拉尔—库兹涅茨克联合公司的两个最主要的组成部分，分别建立在东西相距二千多公里的地方，彼此由铁道线作为强大的运输带联结起来，构成一个煤和钢铁基地的整体。这样的工程是世界史上不曾有过的。
    为了建设这一巨大的联合企业，全国人民给以极大的支援。大批的共产党员和共青团员到工地上来，1929年参加建设这个联合公司的青年就有66，000人。当时在所有为这个工程生产装备品的工厂里，都成立了专以“乌·克·克”（联合公司的俄文简称）为名的共青团突击队。
    严寒的冬季也没有阻止工程的进行。在掘土机对冻僵了的土地无能为力的时候，青年们就拿起铁锄来掘土。工人们战胜了零下50度的西伯利亚的寒冬。有一次，炼铁炉的装料车通穴的土垮下来了，几个工人马上扑上去用自己的身体挡住塌落的大土块，抢救了自己的伙伴。
    关于当时工人艰苦奋斗的情况，库兹涅茨克建设工程的总工程师巴尔金在回忆中曾这样说道：“整天整夜地工作。……从没有过中途脱逃的人。全体都是积极分子，都是战士。”正像他说的，这个工程“按其时期、环境、而主要按这个创造的方法与方式，都是工业史上没有前例的。从头到尾都是具有革命的气概！”
    苏联农民在“为粮食而斗争，就是为社会主义而斗争”的口号下，都节衣缩食，省吃俭用地把最好的粮食和其他农产品都集中起来供给城市，供给工业，拿到国外去换回国家建设最需要的机器设备。先进的集体农庄庄员组成了突击队，努力为国家增产粮食。他们在增产后，更积极地缴公粮，保证社会主义建设的进行。例如，1930年，“到社会主义之路”集体农庄在9月间就全部完成了向国家缴售粮食的计划，总数是3，678，000万斤，9月20日为了庆祝本区集体农民大会又额外卖给国家50万斤粮食，此外为了加强国防建设庄员们又卖了70万斤粮食给国家。伟大的高尔基在给一个农民通讯员的信里这样写道：“多缴点粮食，这种粮食会变成机器，鞋袜，衣服，很好的房屋，——不是那种沉闷的木屋，很好的学校和小孩的托儿所，很好的道路，来还给你们；你们的粮食会变成一百倍来还给你们……”。事实正是这样，从第一个五年计划建设成功以后，苏联农民的生活就一天比一天富裕起来了。
    解放了的苏联妇女也和男子一样为社会主义而劳动。苏联第一名女拖拉机手安格林娜的故事是世界闻名的。她在最初驾驶拖拉机时曾碰到很多困难，甚至遭到讥笑说：“不是娘们驾驶拖拉机，而是拖拉机驾驶娘们！”但是她和她的女友们不管这些讽嘲，终于学会了驾驶的技术。据她说她们曾力求把每次出毛病的原因弄清楚，并常常在深夜同一位青年技术员研究拖拉机教科书上的东西。结果她们的队成了全苏最优秀的拖拉机队之一。安格林娜还曾发出十万个妇女驾驶拖拉机的号召，但响应她的却有20万个妇女。
    苏联青年是建设社会主义的生力军，他们总是活跃在各个战线的最前列。只要看看西伯利亚阿穆尔河上的共青团城，就可以明白苏联青年建设新生活的无穷力量。当时这里只是一个30来户人家的小村子。要在这里建立起一座“共青团城”，这是一个“开天辟地”的工作，一切都得从头学起和做起。例如，苏联英雄、无脚飞将军马列西叶夫在参加这个建设时，就曾做过伐木工、泥瓦匠、轮船上的机器匠和旋工。他们一到这里首先就向大森林进攻，伐木来为自己解决住的问题。有一天他们在完成当天计划的同时，竟打死过153条毒蛇。无数的蚊虫虽使他们消瘦了，但一点没有削弱共青团员们火热的劳动热情。困难是说不完的，但他们把工地看作战场，没有一个困难能难住他们。一个新的城市经过短短三年的时间，在苏联的远东出现了。
    苏联人民充分了解劳动是他们最切身的事业这个真谛，因为他们知道幸福决不是可以不劳而获的。他们正是以对前途满怀胜利信心和对现实埋头苦干的精神，才能建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。这一切之所以如此，正像诗人马雅可夫斯基早在1929年所指出的：
    “因为在苏维埃的国土上有这样的人们。”
    苏联人民能够做到的，我国人民也一定能够做到。因为在我们的国土上也有这样的人！
