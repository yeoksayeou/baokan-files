China's First Thousand-Jin High-Yield County—Chao'an
By our reporter Lin Li

    In 1955, Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, under the attack of a rare and severe drought, achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of double-cropping rice. The total grain output of the county was 370,272,100 jin, an increase of 76.31% compared to 1949, and an increase of 36.53% compared to 1952. The yield per unit area reached 1,060.98 jin, an increase of 41.42% compared to 1952. Therefore, people call Chao'an "Double-Cropping Rice Thousand-Jin High-Yield County." This county has a large population and little land, developed handicrafts, and a large proportion of cash crops. In the past, it was a county that lacked tens of millions of jin of grain every year; now, it has become a county with a surplus of tens of millions of jin of grain.

    According to the national plan, the total output of Chao'an County should reach more than 395 million jin by the end of 1957. In their 1956 agricultural production plan, it is stipulated that the total grain output in 1956 should reach more than 433 million jin. That is to say, the production increase target set by the Five-Year Plan will be overfulfilled by Chao'an County in four years ahead of schedule.

    Strengthen Leadership, Get Organized

    After the land reform ended in 1953, the CPC Yue Dong District Committee studied the situation in Chao'an County and determined that the end of land reform did not mean that rural work should be weakened, but rather that the gained positions should be used to greatly strengthen the Party's leadership in rural areas. In order to effectively implement this policy, the District Committee made Chao'an a key county for carrying out production movements, strengthened the leadership of the county Party committee and district Party committees, and instructed the Chao'an County Party Committee to immediately launch a production movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation.

    Under the direct leadership and support of the District Committee, the Chao'an County Party Committee clarified its direction, unified its understanding, and re-equipped its forces. Among the six secretaries and deputy secretaries of the county Party committee, four were responsible for managing rural work; 14 of the 29 members of the county Party committee regularly resided in rural areas to be responsible for rural work. The various business departments of the county Party committee were also managed by the department heads for central work (i.e., production work), and the deputy department heads were responsible for daily business work. For several years, the county Party committee has been following this direction. Therefore, no matter how many temporary tasks there were, it never affected the work of leading agricultural production.

    At the same time as the District Committee decided that Chao'an County would be the key production county in Yue Dong District, the Chao'an County Party Committee also selected key districts and key townships. They also divided the county's 13 districts into three leadership "units." It was stipulated that the secretaries of the district Party committees in key districts would be served by standing members or deputy secretaries of the county Party committee. Key townships were directly led by deputy secretaries or standing members of the district Party committee. This series of organizational measures not only solved the problem of cadres going to the countryside and delving into rural areas, but also prepared conditions for the working method of using points to lead the whole area.

    For several years, the Chao'an County Party Committee has been regarding the mutual aid and cooperation movement as the fundamental reliance for developing agricultural production. The mutual aid and cooperation movement in Chao'an County has always been ahead of other places in Guangdong. In 1953, the farmers participating in mutual aid groups in Chao'an County accounted for 25% of the total number of farm households in the county.

    In the winter of 1953, Chao'an County piloted 27 agricultural production cooperatives. In the first year after the establishment of these 27 cooperatives, the average grain yield increased by 17.7% compared to 1953, and 21 "Thousand-Jin Cooperatives" emerged. These 27 cooperatives set up a banner of cooperativization for the farmers of Chao'an County; they also became excellent schools for educating rural workers. By the end of 1954, the number of agricultural cooperatives in the county had increased to 298. Although the county suffered from a once-in-a-century drought in 1955, more than 90% of these 298 cooperatives increased production, and 217 became "Thousand-Jin Cooperatives." The Fengshou Cooperative in Cailong Township, Fengxi District, had the highest yield, averaging 1,400 jin of grain per mu. Because of these 298 cooperatives as banners, the 13 districts and 192 townships of Chao'an County saw the emergence of 7 "Thousand-Jin Districts" and 115 "Thousand-Jin Townships," and also saw the emergence of our country's first "Thousand-Jin County."

    Rely on the Masses to Improve Technology

    While developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, Chao'an County relied on mutual aid and cooperation organizations to vigorously build water conservancy projects and systematically carried out a comprehensive reform of agricultural technology. These are some of the major measures for increasing rice production in Chao'an County.

    The main content of Chao'an's agricultural technology reform is to promote small-cluster close planting as the center, while carrying out soil improvement and promoting improved varieties. In Chao'an, the promotion of small-cluster close planting was earlier, faster, and more widespread than in other regions of Guangdong. In 1955, 82.4% of the county's late rice paddies were planted with small-cluster close planting. Recently, Chao'an has taken small-cluster close planting a step further and is preparing to widely promote single-seedling close planting. Their experimental results show that small-cluster close planting can increase grain production by at least 50 jin per mu compared to large-cluster sparse planting; single-seedling close planting yields about 10% higher than small-cluster close planting.

    The promotion of small-cluster close planting must be accompanied by other technical measures. In the process of promoting small-cluster close planting, Chao'an County vigorously carried out a fertilizer accumulation campaign and regarded fertilizer accumulation as an important step in soil improvement. Before liberation, farmers in Chao'an mostly used chemical fertilizers and commercial fertilizers. These fertilizers changed the soil quality, which was particularly lacking in organic matter, becoming "as hot as flint during the day and like plaster when it rains." Current chemical fertilizers and commercial fertilizers also cannot meet the needs of production. For this reason, they seize every season to launch a lively fertilizer accumulation campaign. At first, people swept the streets and picked up manure; later, they dug ditches and pond mud, cut grass to compost fertilizer, and planted green manure crops. In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer, Chao'an County once mobilized district and township cadres to go among the farmers to discover fertilizer sources. A district cadre living in Gubatou Township in District One heard an old man say that the mud dug out from wells in the early years was darker than the mud dug out from ponds now. Under the guidance of the old man, they dug open a hole two or three zhang deep and found that it was full of black silt. According to scientists' analysis, this place was formerly the seabed, and this sea mud contains a large amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and can be completely used to fertilize the fields. The content of organic matter in this sea mud is the highest (accounting for 41.26%), which has a special function for land lacking organic matter. Since the discovery of this fertilizer in Gubatou Township, digging sea mud has become the main content of Chao'an's fertilizer accumulation campaign. Now, no matter where you go in the countryside, you can see large pits here and there, and you can also see piles of sea mud like small mountains. For example, the Wuyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chihu Township applied more than 200 dan of fertilizer (including sea mud, green manure, and miscellaneous soil fertilizer) per mu last year, totaling more than 20,000 jin; topdressing and chemical fertilizers were also applied in the middle. This not only changed the soil and increased the yield, but also reduced production costs.

    Before last year, most of the county used ordinary rice seeds. Because of the vigorous promotion by the leadership, 70% of last year's early rice crop used the "Nante No. 16" variety, and the area using this variety for late rice accounted for more than 35%. According to the farmers' comparative tests, it was proved that "Nante No. 16" can increase rice production by 50 to 100 jin per mu compared to local varieties. While adopting improved varieties, Chao'an also widely promoted advanced methods such as seed selection, seed retention, seed exchange, salt water seed soaking, and seed disinfection. With this series of measures, Chao'an's rice not only has full grains and higher yields, but also greatly reduces pests and diseases.

    One of the important reasons why many advanced experiences can be promoted in Chao'an in a relatively timely and widespread manner is the establishment of full-time technical cadres and a technical network that spans the county. The CPC Chao'an County Committee has an Agricultural Technology Reform Research Office. Each district has an agricultural technology station. The heads of the technical stations are generally members of the district Party committee. Each station has four to eight technicians. In addition, each township and each agricultural cooperative has a technical research group. Before promoting each advanced experience, a technical training class is held once or several times. In the past year alone, 10 such training classes were held, with 8,064 trainees.

    They regard Chihu Township in Songxi District as a base for experimenting with various advanced experiences; at the same time, they regard the Wuyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chihu Township as the focus. Over the years, Chao'an has tested small-cluster close planting, large-area transplanting, single-seedling close planting, and dipping rice seedling roots in fertilizer here. All kinds of measures in Chao'an County's technical reform are almost all first tested here and then promoted.

    In order to promote technology, they organized many large-scale observation and evaluation activities. There are cooperative-wide and township-wide observations, as well as district-wide and county-wide observations. Last year alone, there were more than 30 organized farmer representative delegations visiting the Wuyi Cooperative in Chihu Township. This does not include visiting and delegation groups from outside the county. Observation and evaluation not only promoted the production movement, but also led the cooperativization movement to a new climax.

    Sealing the Rivers and Blocking the Water, Overcoming the Drought

    Chao'an is in the lower reaches of the Han River. Of the county's 192 townships, 80 are on both sides of the Han River, making farmland irrigation very convenient. Most of the land in Chao'an County is fertile alluvial plain, with mountains and hills accounting for less than one-third. The climate here is warm, with rare frosts. Rice can be harvested two or three times a year.

    Before liberation, the people of Chao'an did not have the opportunity to fully utilize these conditions. On the contrary, many convenient conditions for production became a source of pain for the people. The Han River could have been used for irrigation, but because no one repaired the river banks, the riverbed rose day by day, and the river often flooded. In Chao'an County, there are seven large areas of waterlogged areas caused by river flooding, affecting more than 87,000 mu of farmland. Land that could have been harvested two or three times a year could only be planted for one season. In addition, in the mountainous and hilly areas of Chao'an, more than 90,000 mu of land are often under the threat of drought. Even the 400,000 mu of land called paddy fields have insufficient water sources for 210,000 mu. Therefore, people say that the dry land in Chao'an is "red earth for thousands of miles without rain for three days," and the waterlogged areas are "fertile fields become seas after three days of heavy rain." For many years, the people of Chao'an have been doing two things at the same time: flood prevention and drainage in waterlogged areas, and drought resistance and rain seeking in drought-stricken areas. Xindongxi Township in the west of Chaozhou City suffered from two kinds of disasters at the same time. Therefore, people call Xindongxi Township "Starving Birds." The meaning is that even sparrows will starve to death there.

    While developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations, Chao'an County first determined to eliminate the two major enemies of agricultural production—floods and droughts. For this purpose, the people of Chao'an County have made many efforts. Since 1953, the investment in water conservancy projects alone has been more than 2.2 million yuan. The water conservancy workers of Chao'an County have almost traveled all over the land of Chao'an County; they have measured an area of more than 160 square kilometers and collected complete information on river management. Over the past two years, people have built 8,073 large and small water conservancy projects and repaired 71 sections of dikes. Of the 87,000 mu of land that were originally afraid of flooding, more than 52,000 mu have been relieved of flooding; of the 90,000 mu of land that were originally afraid of drought, 80,000 mu have been relieved of drought, and more than 50,000 mu of paddy fields with insufficient water have also had sufficient water sources. In the place known as "Starving Birds," a flood control dike was built, a drainage canal was dug, and two water retaining gates were built at the same time. This not only blocked the floods rushing down from the mountains, but also allowed water to be diverted for irrigation during droughts. This township became a "Thousand-Jin Township" in 1954, with an average production of 1,020 jin of rice per mu. Although it suffered a once-in-a-century drought in 1955, the average yield per mu of land in the township still increased by 52 jin compared to the previous year, with an average yield of 1,072 jin per mu.

    Water conservancy construction is an important guarantee for Chao'an to become a "Thousand-Jin County." In particular, the North Guan and Anjie Han River irrigation projects and the Meixi drainage project, which were completed in the winter of 1954 and the spring of 1955, played a great role in eliminating water and drought disasters. However, in 1955, it encountered a once-in-a-century drought, and it did not rain for 150 days before and after spring plowing. According to historical data, the flow of the Han River was at least 114 units during the lowest period, but in the spring of this year, the river water was only 31 units. The three major tributaries of the Han River in Chao'an, the North Stream and the East Stream, were almost dry, and the West Stream was only one meter deep. All the land that should have been sown and transplanted was cracked.

    Communists were more anxious than any other farmer during these days. The people of the CPC Chao'an County Committee understood that what was on their shoulders was not just one household, but the heavy burden of 700,000 people in the county. Whether the drought can be overcome is not only a question of whether the Party can lead production, but also the key to the survival of the people of the county.

    Sealing the rivers and blocking the water, forcing the water to flow backwards! – This is the method proposed by the CPC Yue Dong District Committee to the people of Chao'an, Chenghai, Raoping, Jieyang and other counties to conquer the drought, and it is also an unprecedented feat.

    The struggle between man and the river unfolded under the Xiangzi Bridge. Xiangzi Bridge is outside Chaozhou City. To its south is the Longqiu Pagoda. In the middle of the bridge and the pagoda is the North Stream, one of the tributaries of the Han River. This stream irrigates most of the land in two districts of Chao'an. To the south of the Longqiu Pagoda, there is also an irrigation culvert called Panyuetou Culvert, which was newly built after liberation. Panyuetou Culvert also controls the water source of 7 townships. Because there was no water in the North Stream and Panyuetou Culvert, most of the land in the southeast of Chao'an City could not be sown. In order to solve the water source problem in these places, the county Party committee decided to build a dam across the river before and after the Longqiu Pagoda. They mobilized more than 32,000 farmers, used more than 5,000 sacks and more than 20,000 jin of straw, and in 7 days and 7 nights of continuous struggle, built a dam across the river, 3 li long and 2-4 meters high, in the Han River, which was more than 80 meters wide. The water level inside the dam rose by 8 inches at once, obediently flowing through the North Stream and the Panyuetou Culvert to various places in the southeast of the city. The land that had been dry for a long time was irrigated by river water.

    At the same time, water diversion dams also began to be built at the places where the other two tributaries of the Han River—the East Stream and the West Stream—divided. The West Stream has more water. However, the East Stream is the most useful. It not only undertakes the irrigation task of the Chao'an Plain area, but also many farmlands in Chenghai County must rely on it for irrigation. According to the instructions of the Yue Dong District Committee, a water diversion dam should be built at the place where the East Stream and the West Stream divide the water, and part of the water from the West Stream should be diverted to the East Stream in order to irrigate the Chao'an Plain area and the land in Chenghai County. This project also fully demonstrated the Chao'an people's tenacious spirit and creative wisdom in fighting against the drought.

    The water diversion dam is 300 meters long and 2 meters high, and is built 5 li below the Xiangzi Bridge. According to the design of the engineering staff, construction started simultaneously from the north and south ends. However, when it was built to the middle, because the water was deep, coupled with the pressure of the dikes on both sides, the power of the water appeared unusually fierce. Therefore, when the project was only 6 meters away from completion, it encountered unexpected difficulties. People threw sandbags, but the sandbags were washed away; they put down bamboo mats, but the bamboo mats disappeared. In the case of the project stagnating, many cadres jumped into the water with the masses, but still could not block the 6-meter gap. In the end, people built a defense line with their bodies, and blocked the 6-meter gap. The water diversion project was completed.

    The completion of the Han River water diversion project played a decisive guarantee role for the rice sowing along the coast of Chao'an and Chenghai. However, just after the rice seedlings were transplanted, there was a heavy rain. This heavy rain was certainly useful for the long-dry land. However, it washed away the water diversion dam. When it was raining after transplanting, there was another summer drought. This meant that the rivers had to be sealed and the water blocked once again. This time, people became more resourceful and more confident. In the reconstruction of the water diversion dam between the East and West Streams, the county's leading cadres discussed the plan with the masses in advance. An old man named Chen Renmian from Futang Township in Linxi District proposed the method of "deep first and shallow later, from top to bottom" used by the ancients to control water, and suggested blocking the deep places first, then the shallow places, and building from upstream to downstream. The leaders of Chao'an County accepted Chen Renmian's suggestion. This time, the construction of the water diversion project was completed in only a little over a day, and a large amount of labor was saved.

    While building dams across the river and water diversion dams under the Xiangzi Bridge, the people in southern Chao'an, together with the people of Chenghai County, blocked the Meixi River. All districts in the county reorganized the tributary river channels and culverts beside the three major streams. Coupled with the struggle to seal the rivers and block the water in the nearby counties of Chenghai, Jieyang, and Raoping, Chao'an successfully survived the once-in-a-century drought and ensured a bumper harvest of early crops.

    The people of Chao'an have endless joy and happiness about the drought resistance struggle in 1955. When the river water first flowed to the cracked land, many people cheered and sang, and many people shed tears of gratitude to the Party and the government. An old scholar wrote two poems for this great struggle; one of them is:

    The Han River has been shallow for a long time,
    Sealing the rivers and blocking the water makes the water flow backwards;
    Irrigating millions of acres of fertile land,
    Celebrating the bumper harvest of disaster relief.

    我国第一个千斤丰产县—潮安
    本报记者　林里
    1955年，广东省潮安县在百年不遇的奇灾大旱袭击下，全县的双季水稻却得到了空前的大丰收。全县粮食总产量是37，027.21万斤，比1949年增加了76.31％，比1952年增加了36.53％。单位面积产量达1，060.98斤，比1952年提高了41.42％。因此，人们都把潮安叫做“双季水稻千斤丰产县”。这个县人多地少，手工业发达，经济作物比重很大，过去一向是个每年缺粮几千万斤的县份；现在，已经成为余粮几千万斤的县份了。
    按照国家计划，潮安县在1957年末，总产量应该达到39，500多万斤。在他们的1956年农业生产计划中规定：1956年的粮食总产量要达到43，300多万斤。这就是说，五年计划所规定的增产指标，潮安县将提前在四年内超额完成。
    加强领导，组织起来
    1953年土地改革结束以后，中共粤东区党委研究了潮安县的情况，认定土地改革结束，并不意味着农村工作应该削弱，而且应该利用已经获得的阵地，大大加强党对农村的领导。为了切实贯彻执行这一方针，区党委就把潮安做为开展生产运动的重点县，充实了县委和各区委的领导力量，并且指示潮安县委立刻掀起一个以互助合作为中心的生产运动。
    在区党委的直接领导和支持下，潮安县委明确了方向，统一了认识，从新配备了力量。县委的6个书记和副书记当中，有4个人负责专管农村工作；从县委会的29个委员中，抽14个人经常住在农村负责农村工作。县委的各个业务部门，也由部长管中心工作（也就是生产工作），副部长负责日常的业务工作。几年来，县委会一直遵循着这个方向。因此，不管有多少临时性任务，始终没有影响到领导农业生产的工作。
    在区党委决定潮安县为粤东区的生产重点县的同时，潮安县委也选择了重点区和重点乡。他们还把全县13个区，划分成为三个领导“单元”。规定重点区的区委书记，由县委的常务委员或副书记担任。重点乡由区委副书记或常务委员直接领导。这一连串的组织措施，不仅解决了干部下乡和深入农村的问题，而且也给以点带面的工作方法准备了条件。
    几年来，潮安县委一直是把互助合作运动当做发展农业生产的根本依靠。潮安县的互助合作运动，一直走在广东别的地方的前面。1953年，潮安县参加互助组的农民就占了全县总农户的25％。
    1953年冬天，潮安县试办了27个农业生产合作社。这27个社成立后的第一年，粮食的平均产量就比1953年增加了17.7％，并且出现了21个“千斤社”。这27个社给潮安县的农民树立了合作化的大旗；也成为教育农村工作人员的极好的学校。到1954年末，全县的农业合作社又发展到了298个。1955年虽然遭到了百年不遇的旱灾，但是这298个社当中90％以上都增产了，有217个成了“千斤社”。产量最高的枫溪区蔡陇乡丰收社，粮食每亩平均达1，400斤。因为有了这298个社做旗帜，潮安县的13个区、192个乡，才出现了7个“千斤区”和115个“千斤乡”，也才出现了我们祖国的第一个“千斤县”。
    依靠群众改进技术
    潮安县在发展互助合作运动的同时，依靠互助合作组织大力兴修水利，并且系统地进行了农业技术的全面改革，这是潮安县水稻增产的几项重大措施。
    潮安农业技术改革的主要内容是以推广小科密植为中心，同时进行土壤改良和推广优良品种。在潮安，小科密植的推广，比广东别的地区要早得多、快得多，并且非常普遍。1955年，全县82.4％的晚稻稻田都是小科密植。最近，潮安又把小科密植提高了一步，准备普遍推广单株密植。他们的试验结果说明：小科密植比大科疏植，每亩至少可以增产粮食50斤；单株密植又比小科密植的产量高达10％左右。
    推广小科密植，一定要有别的技术措施配合。潮安县在推广小科密植过程中，大力开展了积肥运动，并且把积肥当做改良土壤的一个重要步骤。解放以前，潮安农民大多使用化学肥料和商品肥料。这种肥料，使土质发生了变化，其中特别缺乏有机质，“日出如火石，雨来似膏药”。当前的化学肥料和商品肥料，也还不能满足生产的需要。为此，他们就抓紧每个季节，展开热火朝天的积肥运动。开始，人们扫街道，拣粪；后来，进而挖河沟、挖塘泥，割草沤肥，种植绿肥作物。为了克服肥料不足的困难，潮安县曾经发动区乡干部到农民中间去发现肥源。住在一区古板头乡的区干部在访问农民的时候，听一个老人说早年打井挖出来的泥比现在从池塘里挖起来的泥还黑。经过老人的指点，他们挖开了一个两三丈深的洞口，果然发现里面全是乌黑的淤泥，据科学家分析，这里早先是海底，这种海泥含有大量的氮、磷、钾，完全可以用来肥田。这种海泥中，含量最多的是有机质（占41.26％），对于缺乏有机质的土地，更有特殊功用。自从在古板头乡发现了这种肥料以后，挖海泥就成了潮安积肥运动的主要内容。现在不论走到那一个乡村，都可以看见东一个、西一个的大坑，也可以看见堆得像小山一样的海泥。像池湖乡的五一农业生产合作社，去年每亩土地都施肥（包括海泥、绿肥和土杂肥）200多担，合2万多斤；中间还要施追肥，加化学肥。这样不仅改变了土壤，提高了产量，而且降低了生产成本。
    去年以前，全县大部地区还都是用的普通谷种。因为领导方面的大力推广，去年的早稻作物有70％是用的“南特16号”品种，晚稻采用这种品种的面积占35％强。据农民们比较试验的结果，证明“南特16号”比当地品种每亩可以增产50斤到100斤稻谷。在采用优良品种的同时，潮安也普遍推行了选种、留种、换种以及盐水浸种和种籽消毒等先进方法。有了这一连串的措施，潮安的稻谷不仅谷粒饱满，产量增高，而且大大地减少了病虫害。
    许多先进经验，在潮安能够比较及时、又比较普遍地推广，重要原因之一，是设立了专职的技术干部和遍布全县的技术网。中共潮安县委设有农业技术改革研究室。各区有农业技术站。技术站的站长一般都是由党的区委委员担任。各站都有四个到八个技术员。此外，各乡和各个农业合作社，都设有技术研究小组。在推广每一先进经验之前，都要举办一次或几次技术训练班。这种训练班，光是去年一年内，就举办过10次，受训人员达8，064人。
    他们把松溪区的池湖乡，做为试验各种先进经验的基地；同时，又把池湖乡的五一农业生产合作社做为重点。几年来，潮安在这里试验了小科密植，大面积徙种，单株密植、蘸秧头肥等技术。潮安县在技术改革方面的种种措施，几乎都是首先在这里试验而后推广的。
    为了推广技术，他们组织了多次的、大规模的观摩评比。有全社、全乡性的观摩，有全区、全县性的观摩。去年光是到池湖乡五一社观摩的有组织的农民代表团，就达30次以上。本县以外的参观团、访问团还不包括在内。观摩评比，不但推动了生产运动，也把合作化运动引向了新高潮。
    封江堵河，战胜旱灾
    潮安在韩江下游。全县192个乡，就有80个乡在韩江两岸，农田用水非常便利。潮安县的土地，大多数是肥沃的冲积平原，山地和丘陵地带不足三分之一。这里的气候温暖，很少有霜冻。水稻一年可以收两次或三次。
    在解放以前，潮安人民没有充分利用这些条件的可能。相反的，生产上的许多便利条件，反倒成了人民痛苦的源泉。韩江本来可以用来灌田，但是因为江岸无人整修，河床一天天增高，江水经常泛滥成灾。江水为害造成的内涝积水地区，在潮安县境就有7大片，受害农田达87，000多亩。本来可以一年两收或三收的土地，却只能够种一季。另外，潮安的山区和丘陵地带，又有9万多亩地经常处于旱灾的威胁下。就是称为水田的40多万亩土地，也有21万亩水源不足。因此，人们说潮安的旱地是“三日无雨，赤地千里”，内涝积水地区是“三日大雨，良田成海”。多少年来，潮安人民都是同时做着两件事：水灾地区防洪排涝，旱灾地区抗旱求雨。潮州城西的新东锡乡，就在同一个时间受着两种灾害。因此人们把新东锡乡叫做“饿死鸟”。意思是说，麻雀到了那里都会饿死的。
    潮安县在发展互助合作组织的同时，就首先确定要消灭农业生产上的两大强敌——水灾和旱灾。为了这个目的，潮安县的人民曾经做过许多努力。从1953年以来，单是水利工程的投资就有220多万元，潮安县的水利工作人员，几乎踏遍了潮安县所有的土地；他们测量了160多平方公里的面积，搜集了整治江河的完整资料。两年多来，人们修建了大小水利工程8，073宗，培修了围堤71段。原来怕涝的87，000多亩土地，已有52，000多亩解除了水患；原来怕旱的9万多亩土地，有8万亩解除了旱灾，水量不足的稻田，也有5万多亩有了充足的水源。在那被人称为“饿死鸟”的地方，修了一条防洪堤，挖了一条疏水渠，同时筑起两座拦水闸。这样，不仅挡住了山上冲下来的洪水，而且还可以在天旱的时候引水灌田。这个乡在1954年就成了“千斤乡”，平均每亩生产稻谷1，020斤。1955年虽然遭受了百年不遇的旱灾，全乡每亩土地的平均产量还比上年增产52斤，每亩平均产1，072斤。
    水利建设，是潮安成为“千斤县”的重要保障。特别是1954年冬和1955年春完成的北关、安揭两项引韩灌溉工程和梅溪排涝工程，对消灭水旱灾害起了很大作用。但是，1955年碰上了百年不遇的大旱，春耕前后150天没有下雨，据历史资料的记载：韩江的流水，最低时期也有114个流量，可是这年春天，江水只剩下了31个流量。韩江在潮安的三大支流，北溪和东溪几乎干涸了，西溪只有一公尺深的水。本来应播种、插秧的土地，全都龟裂了。
    共产党员在这些日子比任何一个农民都心焦。中共潮安县委的人们都明白：放在他们肩上的不是一家一户，而是全县70万人口的重担。能不能战胜旱灾，不光是党能不能领导生产的问题，而且是全县人民生死存亡的关键。
    封江堵河，迫水倒流！——这是中共粤东区党委向潮安、澄海、饶平、揭阳等县人民所提出的征服旱灾的办法，也是史无前例的壮举。
    湘子桥下展开了人和江河的斗争。湘子桥在潮州市外。它的南面是龙秋宝塔。在桥和塔的中间，就是韩江支流之一的北溪。这条溪，灌溉潮安两个区的大部分土地。在龙秋宝塔的南边，还有一个灌溉涵洞，叫攀月头涵，是解放以后新建的。攀月头涵也控制7个乡的水源。因为北溪和攀月头涵无水，就使潮安城东南的大部分土地不能播种。为了解决这些地方的水源问题，县委决定在龙秋宝塔的前后修建一条拦江坝。他们动员了32，000多个农民，用了5，000多条麻袋和2万多斤稻草，以7天7夜的连续斗争，在80多公尺宽的韩江当中，建筑了一条长达3华里、高达2—4公尺的拦江坝，使坝内的水流一下子提高了8公寸，顺从地通过北溪和攀月头涵流到城东南各地。久旱不雨的土地得到了江水的灌溉。
    同时，韩江的另两个支流——东溪和西溪分水的地方，也开始修建分水坝。西溪的水较多。可是，东溪的用处最大。它不但担负着潮安平原一带的灌溉任务，而且澄海县的许多农田，也要依靠它来灌溉。根据粤东区党委的指示，要在东溪和西溪分水的地方，筑一条分水坝，把西溪的水，分一部分给东溪，以便灌溉潮安平原地区和澄海县的土地。这项工程也充分地显示了潮安人民向旱灾斗争的顽强精神和创造智慧。
    分水坝300公尺长，2公尺高，建在湘子桥下5里的地方。按工程人员的设计，从南北两端同时动工。但是，在修建到当中的时候，因为水深，再加上两端堤坝的逼迫，水的力量显得异常凶暴。所以，当工程剩下6公尺，眼看就要合龙完工的时候，却碰到了意想不到的困难。人们扔下沙包，沙包冲走了；放下竹笘，竹笘不见了。在工程迟滞不前的情况下，许多干部跟群众一起跳下水去，仍然不能把6公尺的缺口堵住。到最后，人们用身体筑起了防线，就把6公尺的缺口堵住了。分水工程完成了。
    韩江分水工程的完成，对于潮安、澄海沿岸的水稻播种起了决定性的保证作用。但是，刚刚插秧完毕，就下了一场大雨。这场大雨，对于久旱的土地当然很有用处。可是，它冲毁了分水坝。在插秧以后正需要雨的时候，又来了夏旱。这就不得不再来一次封江堵河。在这一次，人们就变得更机智也更有信心了。在重建东、西溪的分水坝当中，县的领导干部预先把计划交给群众讨论。磷溪区福塘乡有个叫陈人面的老汉，根据古人治水“先深后浅，由上而下”的办法，提出了先堵深的地方，后堵浅的地方，并且从上游往下游修的建议。潮安县的领导人员接受了陈人面的建议。这次修筑分水工程，只用了一天多的时间就完成了，并且节省了大批人工。
    在湘子桥下修筑拦江坝和分水坝的时候，潮安南部的人们，同澄海县的人民一起封锁了梅溪。全县各区重整了三条大溪旁边的支流河道和涵洞。再加上附近各县—澄海、揭阳和饶平的封江堵河的斗争，就使潮安胜利地渡过了百年不遇的旱灾，保证了早造作物的丰收。
    对于1955年的抗旱斗争，潮安人民有说不尽的欢欣和愉快。当江水初次流向龟裂了的土地的时候，多少人欢呼歌唱，多少人流下了对党对政府感激的热泪。有一位老秀才，为这个伟大的斗争写了两首诗；其中的一首是：
    久旱韩江浅湫湫，
    封江堵河水倒流；
    灌溉良田百万亩，
    抗灾排难庆丰收。
