    Complete Socialist Agricultural Cooperativization Achieved in the Suburbs of Beijing

    (Our report) A new high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture has emerged in the suburbs of Beijing. As of the evening of the 11th, more than 350 agricultural production cooperatives in the five suburban districts of Fengtai, Nanyuan, Shijingshan, Haidian, and the Eastern Suburbs have been merged into more than 220, and all have been transformed into fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives, including 10 large cooperatives with more than 1,000 households. More than 6,500 landlords and rich peasants in these five districts have also been absorbed into the various cooperatives to supervise their production. The work of converting cooperatives in the mountainous areas of the Jingxi Mining Area has also been widely launched and is expected to be completed around the 20th.

    As early as 1952, the suburbs of Beijing piloted two advanced cooperatives. By 1955, the number of advanced cooperatives in the suburbs had grown to 77. In these advanced cooperatives, the elimination of land remuneration greatly increased the enthusiasm of the members for labor, and the land yield and the income of the members were significantly increased compared with the elementary cooperatives; the income of middle peasants with more land generally increased; and the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households with more difficulties were properly arranged, and their lives were also guaranteed. These vivid facts have educated and attracted the broad masses of peasants. After the suburbs fully realized semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization in December of last year, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a rural work conference to plan the overall work of the suburbs. The peasants saw that socialism was right in front of them, and their enthusiasm for taking the socialist road was even higher. The majority of the peasant masses reflected that socialism cannot wait, and they must catch up quickly, and they have asked to turn the elementary cooperatives into advanced cooperatives. According to the requirements of the masses, the Municipal Party Committee revised the plan for the development of advanced cooperatives and arranged for the conversion work on January 3. When the districts conveyed the spirit of the rural work conference of the Municipal Party Committee and raised the issue of conversion, the masses unanimously and enthusiastically supported it. Representatives of 69 of the 73 elementary cooperatives in Haidian District requested immediate approval to become advanced cooperatives. The Eastern Suburbs District did not have an advanced cooperative originally. After the District Committee raised the issue of conversion, representatives of 18 cooperatives also requested to become advanced cooperatives on the spot. After a few days of preparation, the districts began to universally convert cooperatives from the 9th, and all were completed within one or two days. At present, all cooperatives are adjusting their labor organizations and revising their production plans to meet this year's great production upsurge.

    北京近郊完成完全社会主义农业合作化
    本报讯  北京市郊区出现了新的农业社会主义改造的高潮。到11日晚间止，近郊丰台、南苑、石景山、海淀、东郊五个区的350多个农业生产合作社，已经合并成220多个，并全部转成完全社会主义的农业生产合作社，其中千户以上的大社有10个。这五个区的6，500多户地主和富农，也被分别吸收到各个社内，以便监督他们进行生产。京西矿区山区转社工作也已普遍展开，预计20日左右可以全部完成。
    北京市郊区在1952年就试办了两个高级社。到1955年，郊区的高级社已发展到77个。在这些高级社中，由于取消了土地报酬，社员的劳动积极性大大提高，土地产量和社员的收入都比低级社显著增加；土地较多的中农的收入一般都有增加；困难较多的孤寡老弱户得到了适当安排，生活也都有了保障。这些活生生的事实教育并吸引着广大农民。去年12月，郊区全部实现半社会主义农业合作化以后，中共北京市委召开农村工作会议，规划了郊区的全盘工作。农民们看到社会主义就在眼前，走社会主义道路的热情更加高涨。多数农民群众反映，社会主义不能等待，要赶快追上去，纷纷要求把低级社转成高级社。市委根据群众要求，修改了发展高级社的计划，在1月3日布置转社工作。各区在传达市委农村工作会议的精神、提出转社问题的时候，群众一致热烈拥护。海淀区73个低级社的代表，有69个当场要求批准转高级社。东郊区原来没有一个高级社，区委提出转社问题以后，当场也有18个社的代表要求转高级社。各区经过几天准备后，从9日起开始普遍转社，一两天内便全部转完。目前，各社都在调整劳动组织，修订生产计划，迎接今年的大生产高潮。
