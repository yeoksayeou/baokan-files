    Returning from a Visit to Albania
    Liu Shiyi, Head of the Chinese Cultural Delegation to Albania
    The Chinese Cultural Delegation to Albania visited Albania from November 24 to December 20, 1955, for a period of 26 days. During the visit, we attended the celebration of the 11th anniversary of the liberation of Albania held in Tirana. We also visited 8 cities, and toured factories, hydroelectric power stations, farms, seaports, schools, scientific research institutes, museums, galleries, and historical sites. We had very beneficial discussions with Albanian workers in culture, education, science, and art. We also had extensive and unforgettable contact with workers, farmers, women, and children. The Albanian Labor Party and the government gave the Chinese cultural delegation a very cordial and warm reception and made every effort to assist our work. Therefore, although the visit time was very short, we were able to get many opportunities to understand the history of the heroic Albanian people and their new life of building socialism.
    Albania is a brotherly country in our socialist family. The Albanian nation is a heroic nation, and the Albanian people have a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle. On November 29, 1944, under the influence of the great victory of the Soviet anti-fascist patriotic war, the Albanian people completely liberated their homeland from fascist enslavement and began to build their new life. Over the past 11 years, the Albanian people have overcome various difficulties and achieved great achievements in socialist construction. By the end of 1955, the first five-year plan had been completed. The total industrial output has increased by more than 11 times compared to 1938. In agriculture, the sown area has expanded by 70% compared to before liberation. Based on economic development, the Albanian people have also established their own cultural life. Now, illiteracy has been eliminated throughout the country, and a seven-year education system is being implemented in both urban and rural areas. Scientific, literary, and artistic undertakings have been vigorously developed.
    The Albanian people have very warm and friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. They said, "We love the Chinese people," "Our feelings for the Chinese people have arisen from history and from struggle." The leading comrades of the Albanian Party and government have rich experience in struggle. When we are in contact with them, it is as if we are at home. They are so natural, cordial, sincere, and approachable. The Albanian people, including children, showed a kind of joy and friendship from the bottom of their hearts when they saw us. I remember when we were in Elbasan, we took a photo with several Albanian children in front of a Roman-era fortress. At that time, the mother of a child about four or five years old came up to us and asked us to send her a copy of the photo after it was developed, and said: "It is an honor for an Albanian family that my child can take a photo with a Chinese person."
    We will never forget the warm reception given to us by the workers of the "Enver Hoxha" metal processing factory and the farmers of the "Forward" agricultural production cooperative. The workers' concern for China's socialist industrialization and their familiarity with international affairs are amazing. They are very concerned about our struggle to liberate Taiwan. When they said enthusiastically that all their workers supported this sacred struggle, we hugged tightly.
    The male and female members of the "Forward" agricultural production cooperative, dressed in festive costumes, welcomed us with singing and dancing. They also treated us with their own produced fruits, Indian chickens, beef and mutton, milk, and Albanian wine. We sat crowded together, hugging each other, kissing each other, holding arms, drinking wine glass by glass, and warmly congratulating each other.
    We also cannot forget the journey from Vlorë to Sarandë. When we drove into Sarandë, night had already fallen. It took us three or four hours to complete the last 50 kilometers of our journey. This was not because the road became longer, but because the farmers of every village along the way came out to welcome us, supporting the old and carrying the young. Many farmers, women, and children held branches of oranges and lemons, and strings of dried figs in their hands, offering us gifts as if they were offering flowers. Some villages even specially lit up the square and prepared wine and fruit to entertain us. Every time we arrived at a village, the cheers of "Enver, Mao Zedong" always resounded through the clouds. When we finally arrived in Sarandë, the car had been weighed down by about 100 kilograms of oranges, and the fatigue of our journey was swept away by the enthusiasm of the Albanian people.
    We were also welcomed by the soldiers of the Albanian defense outpost. They lined up in a small honor guard and greeted us on a coastal hill. There was an ancient bunker there, which was once used by the reactionary government to imprison Albanian revolutionaries. We stood on the fortress, facing the Adriatic Sea, and talked about world affairs. They also have that national pride that all Albanians have. They are peace-loving soldiers, loyal patriots and internationalists. They not only regard their outpost as their own, but also as an outpost of the great socialist camp. They said: "We know that we are not isolated on this sea. We are also concerned about the struggle in the Taiwan Strait here." They repeatedly told us to "pay tribute to the Chinese People's Liberation Army." Finally, we also took photos with the soldiers, leaving a lasting memory.
    We also visited the 96-year-old linguist Konda and the 68-year-old blind linguist and oral literature scholar Gife Zanci. They are still working hard and making outstanding contributions in academics. Gife Zanci also selected several of his own important works and entrusted us to bring them back to present to Chairman Mao. We also met other scholars and scientists. The Albanian cultural circles have expressed their great yearning for China's long-standing culture. When Konda shook hands with me, he said: "You are the representative of China with thousands of years of culture." We talked from Confucius to Lu Xun, from science to literature. They are very interested in Chinese culture, science, and art, both ancient and modern. They very much hope that the Chinese side can provide them with materials introducing Chinese culture translated into Russian, English, French and other languages.
    These touching things we saw, heard, and came into contact with during our visit to Albania, along with the calm and waveless scenery on the Adriatic coast, the cloudless winter days, the white snow on the Balkan mountains, the lush pine forests at the foot of the mountains, and the millennia-old evergreen olive trees, have all left unforgettable impressions in our memories.
    Faraway Albanian brothers, we miss you. After we return to our motherland, we can still hear those kind and touching words you often say: "Although Beijing and Tirana are far away, there is no distance between our hearts. We are not 1.3 million people, we are 900 million!"

    访问阿尔巴尼亚归来
    中国访问阿尔巴尼亚文化代表团团长　柳湜
    中国访问阿尔巴尼亚文化代表团从1955年11月24日起到12月20日止在阿尔巴尼亚作了为时26天的访问。在访问期间，我们参加了在地拉那举行的阿尔巴尼亚解放11周年庆祝大会，还访问了8个城市，参观了工厂、水电站、农场、海港、学校、科学研究所、博物馆、画廊和古迹名胜等。我们和阿尔巴尼亚的文化、教育、科学、艺术工作者进行了极有益的交谈，也和工人、农民、妇女和儿童作了很广泛的、令人难忘的接触。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府对中国文化代表团给予了十分亲切和热情的接待，并尽力设法协助我们的工作。因此，访问时间虽甚短促，我们却能得到很多机会去了解英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的历史和当前建设社会主义的新生活。
    阿尔巴尼亚是我们社会主义大家庭中的一个兄弟国家。阿尔巴尼亚民族是一个英勇的民族，阿尔巴尼亚人民具有光荣的革命斗争的传统。1944年11月29日，在苏联反法西斯卫国战争取得伟大胜利的影响下，阿尔巴尼亚人民从法西斯奴役下完全解放了自己的国土，并从此开始建设自己的新生活。11年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民克服了种种困难，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就。到1955年底，已完成了第一个五年计划。工业总产量比1938年增加了11倍多。在农业方面，播种面积比解放前扩大了70％。在经济发展的基础上，阿尔巴尼亚人民也建立起了自己的文化生活。现在全国已经消灭了文盲，城乡都在实施七年制教育。科学、文学和艺术事业得到了蓬勃的发展。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民怀有十分热烈的友好感情。他们说：“我们热爱中国人民”，“我们对中国人民的感情是从历史上，从战斗中产生的”。阿尔巴尼亚的党和政府的领导同志都有丰富的斗争经验。我们和他们接触，就好像在家里一样，他们是那样地自然、亲切、恳挚和平易近人。阿尔巴尼亚人民，连儿童在内，一看到我们，眼睛就放出了一种出自心坎中的喜悦和友谊的光芒。记得我们在爱尔巴桑时，曾在一个罗马时代的堡垒前和几个阿尔巴尼亚的孩子一起拍照。当时有一个约摸四、五岁的孩子的母亲走到我们面前，要求照片洗出后送她一张，并说：“我的孩子能和中国人一起拍照，是阿尔巴尼亚家庭的光荣。”
    我们永远也不能忘记“恩维尔·霍查”金属加工工厂的工人和“前进”农业生产合作社的农民们对我们的热情的接待。工人们对中国社会主义工业化事业的关怀和对国际事务的熟悉是令人惊奇的。他们很关心我们解放台湾的斗争。当他们热情地说，他们全体工人都支持这一神圣的斗争的时候，我们紧紧拥抱起来了。
    “前进”农业生产合作社的男女社员，穿着节日的衣裳，一面歌舞一面欢迎我们。还用自己生产的水果、印度鸡、牛羊肉、牛奶和阿尔巴尼亚酒款待我们。我们拥挤地坐着，相互抱着，吻着，交着手臂，一杯一杯地饮着葡萄酒，并互相热烈祝贺。
    我们也忘不了从佛罗那到萨兰达的一段旅程。当我们驱车进入萨兰达境内的时候，夜幕已经降下了。我们最后50公里的行程是用了三、四个钟头才走完的。这倒不是路变长了，而是沿途每一个村子的农民都扶老携幼地出来欢迎我们。许多农民、妇女、儿童的手里拿着一枝枝的柑橘、柠檬，一串串的无花果干，好像献花一样，向我们送礼。有的村子还特地在广场上点起了明灯，备了酒和果子来招待我们。我们每到一个村子，“恩维尔，毛泽东”的欢呼声总是响彻云霄。当我们最后到达萨兰达的时候，车子上已加重了约100公斤的柑橘，我们旅途的劳顿也因为阿尔巴尼亚人民的热情一扫而光了。
    我们也受到了阿尔巴尼亚国防前哨的战士们的欢迎。他们排着不大的仪仗队，在一个滨海的丘陵上迎接我们。那里有一个古老的碉堡，它从前曾被反动政府用来幽禁阿尔巴尼亚的革命者。我们站在堡垒之上，面对亚得里亚海，纵谈起世界大事来了。他们也具有所有阿尔巴尼亚人所有的那种民族自豪感。他们是维护和平的战士，是忠诚的爱国主义者和国际主义者。他们不但把自己的岗哨看作是阿尔巴尼亚自己的，同时也把它看做是伟大的社会主义阵营的前哨。他们说：“我们知道我们不是孤立在这一个海边。我们在这里也关心着台湾海峡的斗争”。他们反复地叮嘱我们要“向中国人民解放军致敬”。最后，我们还和战士们一起拍了照，留下了永久的纪念。
    我们还访问了96岁高龄的语言学家康达，68岁双目失明的语言学家和口头文学家吉斐·赞齐。他们仍在顽强地工作着，并在学术上作出卓越的贡献。吉斐·赞齐并选出他自己的几本重要著作托我们带回来献给毛主席。我们也会见了其他的学者和科学家。阿尔巴尼亚文化界对中国悠久的文化都表示十分向往。康达和我握手的时候就说：“你是具有几千年文化的中国的代表”。我们从孔夫子谈到鲁迅，从科学谈到文学。对于中国的文化、科学、艺术，无论古代的和现代的，他们都很感兴趣。他们很希望中国方面能供给他们介绍中国文化的译成俄、英、法等国文字的资料。
    我们在阿尔巴尼亚访问期间所看到，听到和接触到的这些令人感动的事情和亚得里亚海畔的平静无波的风光，万里无云的冬日，巴尔干群山头上的白雪，山麓郁郁的松林，千年长青的橄榄树一起，都在我们的记忆里留下了难忘的印象。
    远方的阿尔巴尼亚兄弟们，我们怀念着你们。当我们回到祖国以后，我们的耳际还萦回着你们常常说的那些亲切而动人的话：“北京——地拉那虽然相距遥远，但我们的心是没有距离的。我们不是130万人民，我们是九亿！”
