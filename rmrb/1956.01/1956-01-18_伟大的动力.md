    The Great Impetus

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union promulgated on the 15th of this month the draft directives on the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. This will be a great impetus to promote the further development of international peace forces. Because the adoption and implementation of this draft will not only mean that the Soviet Union's economic strength will be further enhanced, but also make the economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries closer. In the final analysis, this will make the socialist camp more consolidated and stronger; it will provide a more solid foundation for the development of world peace forces, thereby making world peace more reliably guaranteed.

    At the time when World War II had just ended, the Soviet Union suffered serious destruction from the Fascist bandits. At that time, Stalin confidently put forward a great goal to the Soviet people: it is necessary to produce 50 million tons of pig iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of oil every year, to create a material basis for communism. It was estimated at the time that it would take about 15 to 20 years. Now, we have seen from the draft directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan that by 1960, the above-mentioned various indicators will be greatly exceeded. This fact convincingly proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The Sixth Five-Year Plan proposes to solve the fundamental economic task of the Soviet Union on the road of peaceful economic competition in the shortest period of history—to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of product production per capita. The heroic spirit and ambitious goals of the Soviet people inspire the broad masses of people in the People's Democratic countries and all peace-loving people in the world. The Soviet Union proves with its actions that it sincerely wishes to coexist peacefully and sincerely hopes that universal world peace will be consolidated. Only those who have lost confidence in the future of their class are afraid of the peaceful competition between the two systems.

    The draft of the Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates the principle of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, and particularly emphasizes vigorously developing the peaceful use of atomic energy. This will raise the entire economic life of the Soviet Union to a new level and give a fatal blow to the advocates of atomic war. Of great significance is that from the draft directives, people can clearly see that the material and cultural life of the Soviet people will be greatly improved. The production of many daily necessities and foods will be more than double that of 1955, and washing machines will even be more than six times. The peaceful nature of the Sixth Five-Year Plan constitutes a sharp contrast with the military nature of the US budget and national economy.

    The draft directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan also raise the issue of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist camp. The draft directives point out that the Soviet Union will do everything possible to expand cooperation with the People's Democratic countries in order to most rationally utilize economic resources and production capacity for the common interests by adjusting the development of various sectors of the national economy, through specialization and cooperation in production, and through the exchange of scientific and technological achievements and advanced experience in production. It is entirely believable that the strengthening of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries on the basis of common interests will greatly accelerate the speed of economic construction of the fraternal countries of the socialist camp, and create the most favorable conditions for the new upsurge of their national economies.

    The Chinese people today are engaging in selfless labor to complete and overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan. The promulgation of the draft directives of the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan is a huge encouragement to the Chinese people. We will take the peaceful labor of the great Soviet people as an example, work hard, and strive to build our motherland into a strong socialist industrial country!

    伟大的动力
    苏联共产党中央委员会在本月15日颁布了关于发展国民经济的第六个五年计划的指示草案。这将是推动国际和平力量的进一步发展的伟大动力。因为这个草案的通过和实施，不仅意味着苏联的经济力量将获得进一步的高涨，而且也使苏联和各人民民主国家的经济合作更加密切。归根到底，这将使社会主义阵营更加巩固，更加强大；使世界和平力量的发展得到更坚实的基础，从而使世界和平获得了更可靠的保障。
    在第二次世界大战刚刚结束的时候，苏联遭到了法西斯强盗的严重破坏。当时，斯大林就满怀信心地向苏联人民提出了一个伟大的目标：必须做到每年出产生铁5，000万吨、钢6，000万吨、煤5亿吨、石油6，000万吨，为共产主义创造物资基础。当时估计，大约需要15年到20年的时间。现在，我们从第六个五年计划指示草案中已经看到，到1960年时，上述各种指标都被大大地超过。这个事实，令人信服地证明社会主义制度的无比优越性。第六个五年计划提出，要在历史上最短的时期内，解决苏联在和平经济竞赛道路上的根本经济任务——在按照人口计划的产品生产量方面，赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。苏联人民的豪迈气魄和远大目标，鼓舞着人民民主国家的广大人民和全世界所有爱好和平的人士。苏联以自己的行动，证明它真诚地愿意和平共处，真诚地希望世界普遍和平获得巩固。只有对本阶级的前途丧失信心的人，才害怕两个制度的和平竞赛。
    第六个五年计划草案中规定了优先发展重工业的方针，并且特别强调大力发展和平使用原子能。这将把苏联的整个经济生活提高到一个崭新的水平，并给予原子战争的鼓吹者以致命的打击。具有重大意义的是：从指示草案中，人们鲜明地看到，苏联人民的物质生活和文化生活都将大大地提高。许多日用品和食品的生产比1955年多出两倍以上，洗涤机甚至多到六倍以上。第六个五年计划的和平性质，同美国预算和国民经济中的军事性质构成了尖锐的对照。
    第六个五年计划指示草案还提出苏联和社会主义阵营各国的经济合作问题。指示草案指出，苏联将尽一切可能扩大同人民民主国家的合作，以便为了共同的利益通过调整国民经济的各个部门的发展、通过生产的专门化和合作，并且通过交换科学技术成就和生产上的先进经验，来最合理地利用经济资源和生产能力。完全可以相信：苏联和各人民民主国家在共同利益的基础上加强经济合作，将大大加速社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的经济建设的速度，为它们的国民经济的新高涨创造了最有利的条件。
    中国人民今天正为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划而进行着忘我的劳动。苏联第六个五年计划指示草案的颁布，对于中国人民是巨大的鼓舞。我们将以伟大的苏联人民的和平劳动为榜样，发奋努力，为把我们的祖国建设成一个强大的社会主义工业国而奋斗！
