Dear Comrade President Wilhelm Pieck:

We are very honored to be able to attend the grand celebration of your 80th birthday and to personally extend our sincere congratulations from the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese Government to you, an outstanding figure in the German and international workers' movement.

After attending your birthday celebration, we also visited several cities and villages in the German Democratic Republic, and visited some factories, agricultural production cooperatives, machine tractor stations, cultural institutions, etc. We were deeply impressed by the glorious achievements of the people of the German Democratic Republic, closely united under the leadership of the German Socialist Unity Party and yourself, in consolidating the people's democratic power, striving for the unification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis, carrying out socialist construction, and improving the people's material and cultural living standards. The achievements of the German Democratic Republic are a great encouragement to the Chinese people.

During our stay in the German Democratic Republic, we were warmly welcomed and cordially received by the government and people of the German Democratic Republic, which made us deeply feel the German people's fraternal friendship towards the Chinese people.

Now, as we leave the German Democratic Republic, please allow us to express our heartfelt gratitude to you, and through you to the German Socialist Unity Party, the government of the German Democratic Republic, and the people. We once again wish you good health and longevity, and wish the German Democratic Republic greater achievements in the cause of socialist construction and in the struggle to establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

Long live the friendship between the people of China and Germany!

Head of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China
Zhu De
