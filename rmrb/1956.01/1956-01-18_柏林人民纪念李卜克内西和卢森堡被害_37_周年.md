    柏林人民纪念李卜克内西和卢森堡被害37周年
    新华社据德意志通讯社报道　柏林各界人民在15日为纪念卡尔·李卜克内西和罗萨·卢森堡被害37周年在柏林社会主义公墓前举行了盛大的游行。
    柏林的劳动人民、自由德国青年联盟盟员、国营工厂武装工人战斗小组、体育和技术协会会员和人民警察在一连5个小时内排队经过这个纪念地点。
    领导这次示威游行的有：以乌布利希和格罗提渥为首的德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员，德意志民主共和国政府人员，全国阵线主席团委员和社会著名人物。
    在战斗小组走过的时候，游行达到了高潮。他们举着标语牌，上面写着：“在工人手中的武器是和平的保证”和“随时准备保卫德意志民主共和国的社会主义成就”。工人团体以及自由德国青年联盟盟员和体育和技术协会会员也高呼：“我们要求建立一支人民的军队”。
    德国统一社会党政治局委员马特恩在他的悼辞中说，需要本着李卜克内西和卢森堡的精神，在我国的西部进行全体工人反对百万富翁、容克地主和军国主义分子的联合斗争。马特恩最后号召全体劳动人民加强工人和农民的政权，准备用各种办法来保卫已有的巨大成就。
