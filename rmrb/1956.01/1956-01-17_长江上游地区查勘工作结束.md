Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th. A group of surveyors who went to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have completed their work and returned to Wuhan. Over 70 days, they surveyed the main stream of the upper Yangtze River and its tributaries, including the Min River, Jialing River, and Wu River, as well as more than ten water conservancy hub areas. They surveyed and mapped the geology and topography of key areas, collected data on navigation, economy, major ports, irrigation, and soil in potentially irrigable areas in the Sichuan hinterland, and preliminarily selected a number of major dam sites.

This survey was the largest ever conducted in the Yangtze River basin. More than 140 people participated, including planning and design, geological, irrigation, navigation, hydropower, and agricultural personnel. Li Baohua, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources, and Soviet experts assisting China in planning the Yangtze River basin, also participated in the survey.

This survey collected a great deal of necessary data for the Yangtze River basin planning, basically formulated the future survey plan, and provided favorable conditions for the preparation of the "Outline of the Yangtze River Basin Plan."

    长江上游地区查勘工作结束
    据新华社武汉16日电　一批到长江上游地区去的查勘人员已经结束工作，回到武汉市。他们在70多天中，查勘了长江上游干流和岷江、嘉陵江、乌江等支流和十来处水利枢纽区，测绘了重点地区的地质、地形图，搜集了这些河流的航运、经济、主要港埠以及四川腹地可能灌溉地区的灌溉、土壤等资料，还初步选定了一批主要的坝区。
    这次查勘是对长江流域最大的一次查勘。参加查勘的人员达140多人，其中有规划设计、地质、灌溉、航运、水力发电和农业等各方面的工作人员。水利部副部长李葆华和帮助我国规划长江流域的苏联专家，也参加了这次查勘。
    这次查勘为长江流域规划搜集了许多必要的资料，基本上制定了今后的勘测计划，对编制“长江流域规划要点”提供了有利条件。
