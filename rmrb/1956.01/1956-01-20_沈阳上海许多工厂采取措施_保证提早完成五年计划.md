    Xu Liangui, Wang Fengen, and 23 other famous labor models and engineering technicians proposed to the city's factory engineering technicians that everyone should humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, closely integrate with the worker masses, improve production technology, and actively cultivate new technical forces in the production struggle to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
