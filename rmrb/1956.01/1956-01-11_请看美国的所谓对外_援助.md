　　U.S. President Eisenhower, in his recent State of the Union address to Congress, asked Congress to "grant limited powers" to "undertake long-term obligations for aid." He explained that the purpose of this "aid" was to enable "the United States and its friends" to "gain greater strength." This further illustrates what the U.S.'s foreign "aid" is really for. And the facts have long proven that the U.S.'s foreign "aid" completely serves its foreign aggression purposes and is a new form of colonialist enslavement.

　　"Recipient" Countries Must Fulfill Military Obligations

　　U.S. foreign "aid" is a bloody business. The "Mutual Security Act," which guides U.S. foreign "aid," explicitly stipulates that recipient countries must "fulfill their military obligations under multilateral or bilateral agreements or treaties (to which the United States is also a party)." In recent years, the United States has been particularly enthusiastic about "aid" to Asia, with a calculation to use dollars to buy Asian cannon fodder. Former U.S. commander in the Korean War, Van Fleet, once calculated for the United States, saying that if the United States were to launch a major war in Asia, it would need two million U.S. troops and would cost $25 billion annually. If Asians were trained and equipped to fight, the cost would only be "one-twenty-fifth."

　　According to figures provided by U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Hansel, the United States has spent approximately $11 billion on such transactions in the past five and a half years. Of course, this is not the entire figure. In fact, in addition to "military aid," the United States also uses "economic aid" to complement and supplement the deficiencies of "military aid." "Economic aid" also serves military purposes. Truman said long ago that "economic aid" is mainly "used to support the expanded defense efforts abroad."

　　"Military aid" accounts for a large proportion of the total amount of foreign "aid" and is increasing year by year. It was 4% in 1949-1950, 23.2% in 1950-1951, increased to 36.7% in 1951-1952, and then soared to 62.6% in 1952-1953, and 67.2% in 1953-1954. It decreased slightly in 1954-1955, but still accounted for 56.9%. The vast majority is military equipment. According to Eisenhower himself, since the implementation of the "Mutual Security Program" in 1950 until the end of June 1955, the United States has shipped $11.4 billion worth of military equipment, supporting 55 countries in expanding their armaments and preparing for war.

　　As the United States creates new war crises in the Far East, it is more urgently in need of cannon fodder from "recipient" countries. Therefore, it has shifted the focus of "aid" to the East. In the past, three-quarters of U.S. aid was used for Europe, but from 1954-1955, aid to Asia and the Far East increased relatively by half compared to Europe. At the same time, the United States single-handedly organized the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. Recently, under the pressure and planning of the United States, several Asian countries have concluded the "Baghdad Pact." These are major steps taken by the United States in preparing for a new war to obtain military bases and gather cannon fodder.

　　Supply Raw Materials, Accept Surplus Goods

　　U.S. foreign "aid" is an important means of economic plunder and control over recipient countries.

　　U.S. monopoly capitalists know that "backward countries" are the main producers of raw materials. In order to plunder and control these raw materials to meet strategic needs, when providing "aid," they require recipient countries to maintain and expand the production of raw materials. At the same time, they force them to conclude treaties with the United States and undertake the obligation to supply raw materials. The United States has signed "economic and technical cooperation agreements" with many Asian countries. For example, the agreement with the Philippines stipulates that the Philippines should "promote the transport to the United States of raw materials lacking in the United States and likely to be lacking in the future." This is not enough. In order to further cruelly exploit these countries, the United States arbitrarily lowers raw material prices by reducing purchases, refusing to purchase, and increasing substitutes, while greatly raising the prices of its own commodities, engaging in unequal exchange and plunder. In 1953 alone, U.S. monopoly capital made an extra $550 million through this means.

　　This kind of cruel plunder is also manifested in the fact that recipient countries must purchase U.S. surplus products with a certain amount of "aid" funds. Sometimes, even if the recipient country has a surplus of such products, it must still comply. According to the "Seoul News," from August 1945 to September 1954, the United States dumped $1.174 billion worth of surplus goods in South Korea under the guise of "economic aid," 80% of which were consumer goods that undermined South Korea's national industry and commerce. In addition, due to the exemption of tariffs and the sale of these goods through rationing, South Korea suffered great losses. Among the more than $500 million in "aid" given by the United States to the "Colombo Plan" countries, surplus agricultural products accounted for one-fifth. In order to earn more money, the United States often sells high-priced, inferior goods, and even moldy grain and cotton, to recipient countries.

　　Spending Money Requires U.S. Approval

　　Through this kind of "aid," the United States can more easily control the economy, politics, and other aspects of recipient countries. For example, it forcibly orders recipient countries to establish "counterpart funds," stipulating that the use of this fund can only be decided after U.S. approval. When the United States uses this fund, it does not base it on the economic development and actual needs of the recipient country, but decides according to its own will and requirements. In this way, the United States controls the direction of economic development of this country. For example, the U.S. occupying authorities disregarded the interests of Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises and allocated a large portion of the "counterpart fund" to industrial enterprises engaged in military production. In addition, the United States also sends economic missions and economic advisors to supervise the use of "aid." As a result, it controls the economic policies and all economic measures of the recipient country.

　　Through this kind of "aid," it also opens the way for the infiltration of U.S. capital. When providing "aid," the United States uses the method of concluding bilateral treaties to force the provision of "fair treatment" and "security" guarantees for U.S. investment, and forces recipient countries to improve conditions favorable to U.S. capital. Last June, the Hoover Commission clearly stated in its report on "Overseas Economic Activities" that all "economic aid" must depend on the recipient country's efforts to improve the atmosphere for U.S. capital investment. After U.S. capital massively invades the economic sectors of recipient countries, it deepens their dependence on the United States. The United States can then use the magic of capital to influence and manipulate the economy, and even the politics, of this country from all aspects. Currently, many economic sectors in Japan have fallen under the control of U.S. monopoly capital. For example, in the total amount of foreign investment in industries such as petroleum, chemicals, electricity, and metallurgy, U.S. capital accounts for 83%. As of June 1953, more than half of the shares of 39 large Japanese companies were mainly owned by U.S. companies.

　　Mortgaging Freedom

　　Through this kind of "aid," it is more convenient for U.S. warmongers to force recipient countries to participate in military alliances or blocs, obey the will of the United States to support its conspiracy to create international tensions and accelerate preparations for a new war, and arbitrarily interfere in the internal affairs of these countries. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Byroade once told Congress without concealment that increasing "aid" to Asia "will give us more say in resolving the political problems in this region." This completely reveals the political intentions of U.S. "aid." There are many examples of this. When the Iranian Zahedi government was established, the United States allowed the granting of $23.4 million in technical "aid" and economic "aid," $20 million in military "aid," and $45 million in so-called "special emergency aid," on the condition that Iran agreed to the U.S. proposals for resolving the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute; that is, accepting the proposals of the international oil consortium; agreeing to the Middle East aggressive bloc pieced together by the United States, that is, signing the Turkish-Iranian military treaty.

　　It is clear that the so-called "aid" from the United States is actually a pre-fabricated trap. Precisely for this reason, more and more countries and people have recognized the essence of U.S. "aid" from their own experiences and therefore prefer to reject this kind of "aid" with ulterior motives. As early as 1953, Nasser revealed: "The United States promised to give us aid, but its condition is that we fulfill its demands in advance and turn our country into a source of profit for it." Recently, Nehru said: "If we stretch out our hands to beg for this kind of aid, then we can only mortgage our freedom, and in the end, we will lose our freedom." Today, the governments and people of Asian countries cherish their national sovereignty, economic interests, and national independence and freedom. They deeply understand what path they should take.

    请看美国的所谓对外“援助”
    史一涛
    美国总统艾森豪威尔最近向国会提出的国情咨文中，要求国会“授以有限的权力”来“承担进行援助的长期义务”。他说明这些“援助”的目的在使“美国和它的朋友”“获得更大的实力”。这就进一步说明了美国的对外“援助”究竟是为了什么。而事实也早已证明，美国的对外“援助”是完全服务于它的对外侵略目的的，是进行殖民主义奴役的新形式。
    受“援”国要履行军事义务
    美国的对外“援助”是一种血腥的买卖。指导美国对外“援助”的“共同安全法”明文规定，受“援”国必须“履行它在多边或双边协定或条约（美国亦为其参加者）下之军事义务”。最近几年来美国特别热衷于对亚洲的“援助”，还有着这样一个如意算盘，就是企图用美元收买亚洲的炮灰。前美国侵朝总司令范佛里特曾给美国算了一个账，他说，美国要在亚洲发动大战就需要二百万美国兵员，每年还得耗费250亿美元，如果训练和装备亚洲人来打，费用只要“二十五分之一”。
    根据美国助理国防部长汉斯尔提供的数字，过去五年半美国在这种买卖上大约花了110亿美元。当然，这不是全部数字。事实上，除“军事援助”外，美国还用“经济援助”来配合和补充“军事援助”的不足。“经济援助”同样也是为军事目的服务的。杜鲁门早就这样说过，“经济援助”主要是“用以支持国外已经扩大了的防御努力”。
    在对外“援助”总额中，“军事援助”占很大部分，而且逐年增加。1949—1950年为4％，1950—1951年为23.2％，1951—1952年增为36.7％，到1952—1953年度就激增为62.6％，1953—1954年又为67.2％。1954—1955年稍减，但仍占56.9％。绝大部分是军事装备。据艾森豪威尔自己承认，仅从1950年“共同安全计划”执行以来直到1955年6月底为止，美国已运出了114亿美元的军事装备，支持55个国家进行扩军备战。
    随着美国在远东制造新的战争危机，更迫切需要受“援”国的炮灰，因此，就把“援助”重点转移到东方。过去美国四分之三的援助用于欧洲，但从1954—1955年起对亚洲和远东的援助相对地比欧洲增加了一半。与此同时，美国一手组织了东南亚侵略集团，最近，在美国的压力和策划下几个亚洲国家又缔结了“巴格达条约”，这些都是美国在准备新战争中所采取的取得军事基地和搜罗炮灰的重大步骤。
    供应原料、接受剩余物资
    美国的对外“援助”是对受“援”国进行经济掠夺和控制的重要手段。
    美国垄断资本家深知“落后国家”是原料的主要产地。为了掠夺并控制这些原料以满足战略需要，在给予“援助”的时候，就要受“援”国维持和扩大原料的生产，同时还强使同美国缔结条约，承担起供应原料的义务。美国同亚洲许多国家都订了“经济技术合作协定”，例如对美菲的协定中就规定：菲律宾应“促进以美国所缺乏的及可能缺乏的原料运往美国”。这还不足，美国为了进一步对这些国家进行残酷的剥削，又采用减购、拒购以及增加代替品的办法任意压低原料价格，而美国出卖自己的商品的时候却大大抬高货价，进行不等价交换，从事掠夺。仅1953年美国垄断资本通过这种手段就多赚了5.5亿美元。
    这种残酷的掠夺还表现在受“援”国必须以一定数额的“援”款购买美国剩余产品，有时这种产品受“援”国自己虽有剩余也得照办。据“汉城新闻”报道，从1945年8月到1954年9月，美国以“经济援助”名义在南朝鲜就倾销了11.74亿美元剩余物资，其中80％是破坏南朝鲜民族工商业的消费品；此外，由于免征关税并以配给方式出卖这种商品，使南朝鲜受很大损失。在美国给予“科伦坡计划”国家的“援助”五亿多美元中剩余农产品就占五分之一。美国为了赚更多的钱经常以高价、劣货甚至把霉烂了的粮食和棉花等卖给受“援”国。
    用钱要美国批准
    通过这种“援助”，美国就较方便地控制了受“援”国家的经济、政治等各方面。譬如强令受“援”国建立“对等基金”，规定只有经过美国的批准才能决定这项基金的用途。美国运用这项基金的时候不是根据受“援”国的经济发展和实际需要，而是依照美国自己的意志和要求决定，这样美国就掌握了这个国家经济发展的方向。例如，美国占领当局不顾日本中小企业的利益，而把很大部分的“对等基金”拨给那些从事军事生产的工业企业。另外，美国还派遣经济使团和经济顾问监督“援助”的使用，结果，就掌握了受“援”国的经济政策和一切经济措施的大权。
    通过这种“援助”，还给美国资本渗入打开了道路。美国在给予“援助”的时候，就利用缔结双边条约的方法迫使对美国投资提供“公正待遇”和“安全”的保证，并强使受“援”国改善有利于美国资本的条件。去年6月胡佛委员会在关于“海外经济活动”的报告中就明确地说，一切“经济援助”必须要看受“援”国努力改进对美国资本投资的气氛而定。当美国资本大量侵入受“援”国的经济部门以后，就加深了对美国的依赖，美国就可利用资本的魔力从各方面影响并操纵这个国家的经济，甚至政治。目前，日本许多经济部门已落入美国垄断资本的控制之下，如在石油、化学、电气和冶金等工业的外国投资总额中，美国资本占了83％。到1953年6月为止，39个日本大公司一半以上的股票主要为美国公司所有。
    抵押自由
    通过这种“援助”，更便利美国好战分子迫使受“援”国家参加军事同盟或集团、听命美国意志支持它制造国际紧张局势和加速准备新战争的阴谋，并肆意干涉这些国家的内政。美国助理国务卿拜楼德就曾毫无掩饰地告诉国会说，增加对亚洲的“援助”，“定将使我们得到解决这一地区政治问题方面更多的发言权”。这完全吐露了美国“援助”的政治企图。这方面的事例很多。当伊朗萨希迪政府成立时，美国允许给予2，340万美元的技术“援助”和经济“援助”，二千万美元的军事“援助”，4，500万美元的所谓“特别非常援助”，条件是：伊朗同意美国所提出的解决英伊石油争执的建议；即接受石油国际财团的建议；同意美国所拼凑的中东侵略集团，即签订土伊军事条约。
    由此可见，美国的所谓“援助”其实是一个预制的圈套。正因如此，越来越多的国家和人民从切身的经验中认清了美国“援助”的本质，因而宁愿拒绝这种别有用心的“援助”。早在1953年纳赛尔就曾揭露说：“美国答应给我们援助，然而它的条件是我们预先履行它的要求，并且把我们的国家变成它榨取利润的泉源。”最近，尼赫鲁说：“伸出我们的双手，乞求这种援助，那我们只有拿出我们的自由去抵押，并且将在最后失去我们的自由”。今天，亚洲国家的政府和人民珍重的是自己的国家主权、经济利益以及民族独立和自由。它们深深懂得自己应该走什么样的道路。
