To the Editor:

    The high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement in Chengguan Town, Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, has arrived. In just over a month, the number of agricultural cooperatives has increased from 7 to 17, and the number of member households has increased from 421 to 1,083 (accounting for 88.5% of the total households).

    With the development of the cooperative movement, an unprecedented fertilizer accumulation upsurge has been set off throughout the town. There is a main street in Dongguan that was filled with ash and soil from houses burned down by the Japanese invaders in the past. Members of the agricultural cooperatives dug up a layer of excellent fertilizer on this main street, amounting to more than 18,000 dan. On another main street, more than 8,000 dan of good fertilizer were also dug up. In 25 days, the whole town cleared garbage and accumulated a total of 127,000 dan of fertilizer. Adding to the original fertilizer, there is an average of 114 dan per mu of land. Now, the farmers of the whole town are working hard to do a good job in winter production, preparing to lay a good foundation for a bumper harvest in 1956.
Secretary of the Chengguan Town Branch of the Communist Party of China in Lingchuan County, Yang Yingui

    垃圾也成了肥料编辑同志：
    山西省陵川县城关镇农业合作化运动的高潮到来了。仅仅一个多月的时间，农业社已经由7个发展到17个，入社农户也由421户发展到1，083户（占总农户的88.5％）。
    随着合作化运动的发展，全镇掀起了一个空前未有的积肥热潮。东关有一条大街，是用过去日本侵略者烧掉的房屋的灰土填起来的。农业社的社员们就在这条大街上，起出一层很好的肥料，有18，000多担。在另一条大街上，也掘起了上好肥料8，000多担。在25天内，全镇清除了垃圾，共积肥127，000担。加上原有的肥料，每亩地平均有114担。现在，全镇农民正在努力做好冬季生产，准备给1956年的丰收打下良好的基础。中共陵川县城关镇支部书记  杨银贵
