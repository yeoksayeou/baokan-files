The British government is facing severe difficulties both domestically and internationally. The deteriorating economic situation and the failure of its foreign policy have aroused fierce criticism from British public opinion and within the Conservative Party itself against the Conservative government. The British "Daily Herald," in describing the predicament of the British government, wrote: "Eden has become the most unpopular Conservative Prime Minister since Chamberlain was ousted in 1940."

In this context, Eden delivered a speech in Bradford on January 18. Western news agencies had speculated that Eden's speech would respond to the "storm of accusations" from public opinion. Now, according to Agence France-Presse, British political figures initially "felt disappointed" with the speech and "believe that it did nothing to dispel the recent unease felt about the government's handling of matters."

This is not an unfounded accusation. Eden not only failed to offer any beneficial solutions to how to escape Britain's current predicament in his speech, but also distorted reality and created an atmosphere of tension on the issues of domestic and international affairs. The purpose of this speech was obviously to attempt to divert attention at home and abroad so that the current government could continue to pursue the domestic and foreign policies that have already met obstacles everywhere, regardless of the wishes of the vast majority of the British people.

First of all, on the domestic economic front, Eden whitewashed the situation, disregarding the facts. He deliberately avoided mentioning the huge trade deficit, the sharp decline in gold and dollar reserves, and the ever-increasing cost of living – these serious problems in British economic life. Instead, he portrayed Britain's current deteriorating economic situation as "unprecedented prosperity," and inflation as merely a "trouble of prosperity." According to Eden, there seemed to be nothing to worry about in Britain's economic situation. However, he also contradicted himself by admitting that there were indeed some "difficulties" and that there were "no clever and quick solutions." To this end, he also announced the "determination" and steps to "curb inflation." Here, it is worth noting that Eden particularly emphasized the "determination" not to cut so-called "defense spending."

It should be pointed out that the so-called "steps to curb inflation" announced by Eden are nothing more than the old methods that Butler had touted in the past and that have already gone bankrupt. That is, "the method of tightening the belts of the people to prevent inflation," as described by the "New York Herald Tribune." However, in the past year, especially since Butler's autumn budget was implemented, the British people's belts have been tightened even more, but inflation has not only not been "curbed," but has become even worse. Even Butler had to be transferred from the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer because of this. Nevertheless, Eden still wants to continue to implement Butler's policies, which can only prove that the Conservative government wants to further tighten the people's belts to engage in the expansion of armaments. And this is precisely the root cause of Britain's increasing economic difficulties.

The Bradford speech did nothing to ease the international situation and would only have the opposite effect. Eden openly attempted to obliterate the positive results achieved in easing international tensions since the Four-Power Summit, and alarmistly said that the "danger of world war and military conflict" still "always exists." He also said: "Hostilities in a critical area like the Middle East could easily trigger a global explosion." At the same time, he followed Dulles in repeating the so-called "policy of deterrence."

Eden's choice of this time to use intimidation tactics is obviously extremely inappropriate. A few days ago, US Secretary of State Dulles was met with angry condemnation from world public opinion for publishing a talk brandishing hydrogen bombs in "Life" magazine. The "Yorkshire Post," which was described by British newspapers as Eden's "megaphone," criticized Dulles's atomic war intimidation in an editorial. It said that this method of intimidation was "bluster" and believed that Dulles's approach was wrong because "it is the weapon of fools" and "those who use this weapon will inevitably suffer...". People have good reason to offer these pertinent words of the "Yorkshire Post" to Mr. Eden, who is trying hard to follow Dulles.

Eden deliberately portrayed the situation in the Middle East as very terrible, but he dared not say the reason for the tension in the Middle East. However, this cannot be concealed. It is none other than the policy of the United States and Britain in stepping up the formation of the Baghdad Pact group in the Middle East and suppressing the national liberation movements of the people of various Middle Eastern countries that has created the tension in the Middle East. The American "Christian Science Monitor" raised the issue in an article commenting on Eden's upcoming visit to the United States: "The Baghdad Pact is almost exploding in the face of its creators." This newspaper also said: "This organization, which is considered to be a tool of Western power in the Middle East, has proven to be an explosive cause of discord and unrest throughout the region from Suez to the Malay Peninsula." In this situation, Britain is playing a particularly disgraceful role. Its planning and forced accession of Jordan to the Baghdad Pact group suffered a tragic failure, but it is not reconciled. Instead, it has mobilized a large number of troops to Cyprus, attempting to use this to suppress the Cypriot people's movement for national self-determination and intimidate the Jordanian people. It is afraid of the development of normal trade between Middle Eastern countries and socialist camp countries, and it tries its best to slander others for fueling the "arms expansion" in the Middle East, but it secretly sells arms to Egypt and Israel, which are constantly in conflict with Egypt.

This British practice in the Middle East has also aroused fierce opposition in Britain. A Reuters commentator pointed out: Broad British public opinion believes that Britain has made a great mistake in the Middle East and has lost touch with reality. People from all walks of life in Britain are demanding that the Conservative government change its policy towards the Middle East. Shouldn't the British government reflect on itself?

One of the fundamental reasons for the failure of British foreign policy is its deep-rooted colonialism. Now Eden insists that others' accusations of British colonialism are a "distortion" of British policy and does not admit that British colonialists "want to ride on the backs of other peoples." However, it is useless to try to make a clean defense for British colonialists. Not only is the history of British colonialists impossible to tamper with, but the current reality also puts forward a strong accusation against British colonialists. Not to mention anything else, just pointing out what the British colonial army has done in Malaya, Kenya, and Cyprus, isn't it what the British colonialists have done in order to "ride on the backs of other peoples"?

Following the United States' "policy of strength" and forcing the British people to continue to bear the burden of arms expansion and war preparation will never solve the difficulties currently facing the British government. On the contrary, this approach can only arouse greater resistance from its own people and the people of the colonies. If the British Conservative government continues to follow this path, it will only sink deeper and deeper into the already inextricable mire. This is the only conclusion that people have made about Eden's speech in Bradford on January 18.

    评艾登的演说
    高集
    英国政府在国内外正面临着严重的困难。日益恶化的经济情况和外交政策的失败，引起了英国舆论和保守党内部对保守党政府的猛烈抨击。英国“每日先驱报”在描述英国政府的处境时写道：“艾登已成为自从张伯伦于1940年被赶下台以来最不得人心的保守党首相了。”
    在这样的情况下，艾登1月18日在布莱德福发表了演说。西方通讯社曾经传说，艾登的这个演说将对舆论“指责的风暴”提出答复。现在，根据法新社报道，英国政界人士首先就对这个演说“感到失望，并且认为它丝毫没有驱散最近对政府处理事情的方法所感到的不安。”
    这不是没有根据的指责。艾登在演说中不但对如何摆脱英国目前所处的困境没有提出任何有益的办法，反而一味地在国内外局势的问题上歪曲现实，制造紧张空气。这个演说的目的显然是企图转移国内外的视线，以便现政府能够不顾广大英国人民的意愿，继续奉行那种早已到处碰壁的国内外政策。
    首先，艾登在国内经济问题上，不顾事实地粉饰太平。他故意不谈英国贸易的巨大逆差、黄金美元储备的急剧减少以及日益高涨的生活费用这些英国经济生活中的严重问题，反而把英国目前日益恶化的经济情况说成是“空前的繁荣”，而通货膨胀也只不过是“繁荣的麻烦”。按照艾登的说法，英国的经济情况似乎根本没有什么值得担心的事情。但是，他同时又自相矛盾地承认的确存在着某种“困难”，而且“没有巧妙和迅速的解决办法”。为此，他还宣布了“制止通货膨胀”的“决心”和步骤。在这里，值得注意的是，艾登特别强调了绝不削减所谓“防御费用”的“决心”。
    应当指出，艾登宣布的所谓“制止通货膨胀”的那些步骤，不过是巴特勒过去早已高唱过、并且已经破了产的老办法。那就是“纽约先驱论坛报”所描写的使人民“束紧裤带的办法来防止通货膨胀”。可是，在过去的一年中，特别是自巴特勒的秋季预算实行以来，英国人民的裤带是被束得更紧了，而通货膨胀却不但没有被“制止”，反而更形恶化了。甚至巴特勒也不得不因此从财政大臣的职位上被调开了。尽管如此，艾登却还要继续推行巴特勒的政策，这只能证明保守党政府要进一步束紧人民的裤带来从事扩张军备。而这正是英国经济日益困难的根源。
    布莱德福演说对于缓和国际局势不但毫无益处，而且只会起相反的作用。艾登公然企图抹杀四国首脑会议以来在缓和国际紧张局势方面所取得的积极成果，而危言耸听地说什么“世界大战和军事冲突的危险”还“始终存在着”。他并且还说：“像中东之类的某一紧要地区的敌对行动可以很容易地引起世界性的爆炸。”同时，他又跟在杜勒斯后面重复所谓“威慑政策”。
    艾登选择这个时候来要恐吓手段，显然是极端不合时宜的。前几天，美国国务卿杜勒斯由于在“生活”杂志上发表了一篇挥舞氢弹的谈话而遭到世界舆论的愤怒斥责。被英国的报纸称为是艾登的“传声筒”的“约克郡邮报”，就在社论中指斥杜勒斯的原子战争恐吓。它说这种恐吓办法是“虚张声势”，并且认为杜勒斯的这种做法错了，因为“这是糊涂人的武器”，“使用这种武器的人终不免要遭殃的…”。“约克郡邮报”的这番中肯的话，人们很有理由把它贡献给极力想追随杜勒斯的艾登先生。
    艾登故意把中东局势渲染得非常可怕，但是他不敢说出中东局势紧张的原因。然而这瞒不住人。不是别的，正是美国和英国在中东加紧拼凑巴格达条约集团、镇压中东各国人民民族解放运动的政策，造成了中东的紧张局势。美国“基督教科学箴言报”在评艾登即将访美的文章中就曾提出：“巴格达条约几乎是在它的缔造者面前爆炸开了。”这家报纸并且说：“这个被认为是西方在中东的力量的工具的组织已经证明是使从苏彝士到马来半岛整个地区产生不和和骚乱的一个爆炸性的原因。”在这种局势中，英国起着一种特别不光彩的作用。它策划并强迫约旦加入巴格达条约集团遭到了悲惨的失败，然而它却并不甘心。它反而调集大批军队到塞浦路斯，企图借此镇压塞浦路斯人民要求民族自决的运动并恫吓约旦人民。它害怕中东国家和社会主义阵营国家正常贸易的发展，竭力诬蔑别人助长中东的“军备扩张”，但是它自己却偷偷地把军火卖给埃及和与埃及不断发生冲突的以色列。
    英国在中东这种做法，在英国国内也引起了激烈的反对。路透社的评论员就曾指出：广泛的英国舆论认为英国在中东犯了极大的错误，它脱离了现实。英国各阶层人士都要求保守党政府改变它对中东的政策。难道英国政府不应该自己反省一下么？
    英国外交政策失败的根本原因之一，就是它的根深柢固的殖民主义政策。现在艾登却硬说别人对英国的殖民主义的指责是对英国政策的“歪曲”，不承认英国的殖民主义者“要骑在其他人民的身上”。然而，想替英国殖民主义者作清白辩护是没有用处的。不但英国殖民者的历史是无法篡改的，就是目前的现实也对英国殖民者提出了有力的控诉。别的不说，只要指出英国殖民军队在马来亚、怯尼亚和塞浦路斯的所作所为，难道不是英国殖民者为了“要骑在其他人民的身上”而干出来的么？
    追随美国的“实力政策”，并强使英国人民继续承受扩军备战的重担，这绝不能解决当前英国政府所面临的困难。相反的，这种做法只能激起本国人民和殖民地人民的更大反抗。英国保守党政府继续沿着这条道路走下去，只有使它在已经不可自拔的泥坑中愈陷愈深。这就是人们给艾登18日在布莱德福发表的演说所做的唯一结论。
