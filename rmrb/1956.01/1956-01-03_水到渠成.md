　　Success Comes Naturally
    Yuan Hongfang, Fang Qing
    Since the establishment of cooperatives in Yaobao Village (Township), Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, in 1952, five cooperatives have been established successively. All middle and poor peasants have joined the cooperatives, except for four landlord and rich peasant households. The main village (town) has 201 households and three cooperatives, while the affiliated village has 92 households and two cooperatives. The land remuneration of the five cooperatives gradually decreased from an average of 1.4 dan per hectare to an average of 1 dan (400 jin). Horse carts were valued and turned over to the public in the spring of 1955, with the stipulation that they would be paid off within two to three years, and interest would be paid on the arrears at the bank rate. The three cooperatives in the main village abolished land remuneration in the winter of 1955 and merged into an advanced cooperative. It was named "Liaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative". The transition of these three cooperatives from elementary to advanced cooperatives went through the following four steps:
    1. Starting with Summarizing Production
    The county and district work team arrived in Yaobao Village on November 1, 1955, and led the Party branch and the key members of the first, second, and third cooperatives to establish a preparatory committee for the transition to an advanced cooperative.
    The first task of the preparatory committee was to summarize the year's production. In 1955, the average yield per hectare in the village increased by 800 jin compared to the previous year. The main reasons for the increase were the application of a layer of black river soil to 220 hectares of yellow soil and the increase in the number of crop plants on 270 hectares. These facts show that the increase in production mainly came from labor.
    Then, the financial work of the three cooperatives was checked, and a general account was calculated for the three cooperatives. The public accumulation of the three cooperatives, including the production costs for 1956, was about 80,000 yuan, which shows that these three cooperatives already had the material basis for transitioning to an advanced cooperative.
    2. Removing Ideological Obstacles
    After summarizing production, a propaganda plan was formulated with the Party branch committee as the core. The Party's agricultural collectivization policy and the benefits of running advanced cooperatives were publicized through holding forums for people of all classes and types. Then, the branch held a Party member meeting to unify the thinking within the Party.
    At the Party member meeting, the parochialism of Yu Decai, the deputy director of the first cooperative, was first criticized. The first cooperative had the most public accumulation. For example, if public houses, furniture, and farm tools within the cooperative were converted into value, each laborer could share 47 yuan, but the second cooperative could only share 23 yuan, and the third cooperative could only share 16 yuan. Therefore, Yu Decai advocated that "the public accumulation of each cooperative should be distributed to each cooperative, and the shares should be averaged after the transition to an advanced cooperative." The branch believed that this kind of parochialism did not conform to the Party's policy and educated him based on the following two principles: 1. Public property is gradually accumulated with the development of production, and public accumulation funds and public welfare funds are to guarantee the expansion of production and the development of cultural and welfare undertakings within the cooperative. It should be handled in accordance with the principles of Article 68 of the "Draft Model Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" and is not allowed to be decentralized. 2. "Farmers all over the world are one family." Communist Party members should give full play to the spirit of unity and fraternity and should not only care about their original small unit, regardless of everyone else. Secondly, Bai Wanjin, a member of the branch committee, was criticized for his serious selfishness. Bai Wanjin was the director of the second cooperative. He was irresponsible for the paddy fields owned by the whole village, sending semi-laborers to top off full work when planting rice; and when horse carts were valued and turned over to the public in the spring, he tried to raise the price of his own horse, making the valuation standards inconsistent among the cooperatives. After criticism, Yu Decai and Bai Wanjin both made self-criticisms. This was a good education for all Party members, which raised their socialist consciousness and laid a solid ideological foundation for running advanced cooperatives well.
    When understanding the ideological trends of all classes, it was found that almost 100% of the poor and lower-middle peasants advocated transitioning to advanced cooperatives. Only a few people with weak labor power and those who could not afford the share fund had some concerns. For the former, it was mainly explained to them that advanced cooperatives have a wide range of operations, and those with weak labor can also have appropriate work. For the latter, it was explained that those who really cannot afford the share fund can apply to the bank for a poor peasant cooperative fund loan. These two types of people quickly dispelled their ideological concerns.
    Upper-middle peasants were not very active in transitioning to advanced cooperatives. Analysis showed that there were roughly three situations: one was represented by Li Fang, whose family had one laborer and two horses. One horse was enough for him to pay the public ownership share fund he should pay. He wanted to withdraw one horse, or withdraw the horse price he should get, so that he could retain part of his "fixed assets." One was represented by Zhou Guangwen, whose family had 6 hectares and 1 mu and 5 fen of land. After the transition to an advanced cooperative and the abolition of land rent, he would lose six dan of grain of land remuneration every year, worth 107 yuan at market value. The third was Li Xiangcai, who relied on having two horses and a cart to join the cooperative, so he did not participate in labor properly and only got more than 30 workdays this year. Based on the above situation, the branch committee carried out different education for different ideas of various people.
    3. Handling Specific Issues
    After various ideological problems were resolved, registration to join the advanced cooperative began. The registration situation was very enthusiastic. After registration was completed, the next step was to review the members and elect the management committee. A total of 21 management committee members were elected (including four poor peasant households, eleven lower-middle peasant households, and six upper-middle peasant households), and three supervisory committee members (all poor and lower-middle peasants). In order to strengthen the leadership of the new cooperative, the Hulan County Party Committee, with the consent of the members, appointed Du Debao, the original second secretary of the district party committee, as the director of the cooperative, and Zhu Wanyou, the secretary of the village branch, was elected as the deputy director. In this way, the new institution was produced.
    At the first member congress, the temporarily drafted cooperative regulations and the resolution that all public property of the original cooperatives should be owned by the cooperative were passed; the amount of the share fund and the apportionment method were determined. The production cost and share fund were calculated based on the seeds, fertilizers, and feed costs required for agricultural production in 1956, which roughly offset the amount of production costs left over from the original cooperatives. The public ownership share fund (mainly the valuation fee for horse carts and some farm tools) was apportioned according to labor. After the members valued their horse carts and farm tools and joined the cooperative, they would be compensated for overpayment and required to make up for underpayment according to the amount of share fund that should be paid. A small number of poor, old, and weak members could be exempted from payment. Those who have labor but are poor and cannot afford to pay can defer payment and apply for a poor peasant cooperative fund loan on behalf of the cooperative.
    4. Welcoming Great Production
    The first management committee of the Liaoyuan Agricultural Cooperative after its completion resolved the issues of labor organization and production planning. The whole cooperative was divided into five production teams: three dry land production teams, one paddy field production team, and one sideline production team. According to the plan, the output per hectare in 1956 will increase to 4,440 jin of raw grain. In order to do a good job in production preparation, they had already dug 5,700 meters of paddy field ridges before and after the transfer of the cooperative, and also dug 300 meters of water trenches with neighboring villages, and also overturned 300 hectares of manure; they never interrupted autumn plowing for a day, and have completed 270 hectares of autumn plowing, exceeding the original plan by 70 hectares. This has laid a favorable foundation for the first year of harvest after the transition to an advanced cooperative.

　　水到渠成
    袁洪芳　方青
    黑龙江省呼兰县腰堡村（乡），自从1952年开始建社以来，先后建立了五个社；全村除四户地主、富农没有入社外，中贫农全部入了社。主屯（村）201户，有三个社，附属屯92户，有两个社。五个社的土地报酬逐渐由每公顷平均一石四斗降到平均一石（四百斤），车马已经在1955年春天作价归公，规定二至三年内还清，欠款按银行利息付息。主屯的三个社已在1955年冬季取消土地报酬，合并转为高级社。起名叫“燎原农业生产合作社”。这三个社由低级社转高级社的过渡工作，经过了以下四个步骤：
    一、从总结生产入手
    县区工作组在1955年11月1日到达腰堡村，领导党支部和第一、第二、第三社的主要骨干分子建立了一个过渡高级社的筹备委员会。
    筹备委员会的第一件工作，是总结一年的生产。1955年全村每公顷地平均比上年增产八百斤。增产的原因，主要是在220公顷黄土地里铺上了一层黑河土；在270公顷地上增加了作物株数。这些事实说明增产主要是从劳动得来的。
    接着检查了这三个社的财务工作，给这三个社算了一次总账。三个社的公共积累包括1956年的生产费用大约有八万元，这说明这三个社已经有了过渡到高级社的物质基础。
    二、扫除思想障碍
    总结生产以后，便以党的支委会为核心拟定了宣传计划，通过召开各阶层、各类型人的座谈会等方式，宣传了党的农业合作化政策和办高级社的好处。接着支部召开党员大会，统一了党内思想。
    在党员大会上首先批判了第一社副主任于得财的本位主义思想。第一社公共积累最多。如社内公共房子、家具、农具等折价，每一个劳动力可均摊47元，但是第二社只能均摊23元，第三社只能均摊16元。因此，于得财就主张“各社公共积累归各社均分，转高级社后平均入股”。支部认为这种本位主义思想是不符合党的政策的，根据下面两条原则对他进行了教育：一、公共财产是随着生产的发展逐渐积累起来的，公积金、公益金又是保证扩大生产和发展社内文化福利事业的，应该按照“农业生产合作社示范章程草案”第68条的原则处理，不允许分散。二、“天下农民是一家”，共产党员更应当发挥团结友爱的精神，不能只顾自己原来的小单位，不管大家。其次是批评了支部委员白万金的严重自私自利思想。白万金是第二社主任，他对待全村公有的稻田不负责任，种稻时派半劳动力来顶整工；并且在春天车马作价归公的时候，设法提高自己的马价，弄得各社作价标准不一致。经过批判，于得财、白万金都作了检讨。这对全体党员是一个很好的教育，提高了党员的社会主义觉悟，为办好高级社奠定了巩固的思想基础。
    在了解各阶层思想动态的时候，发现贫农和下中农几乎是100％主张过渡到高级社。只有少数劳动力不强的和拿不起股份基金的稍有顾虑。对于前一种人，主要是向他们说明高级社经营方面很广，劳力弱的也能有适当工作。对后一种人说明：真正拿不够股份基金的，可以向银行申请贷给贫农合作基金。这两种人很快就解除了思想顾虑。
    上中农对转高级社不太积极，分析起来大致有这么三种情况：一种以李方为代表，他家一个劳动力，两匹马，一匹马就够他所应交的公有化股份基金，他想最好抽回一匹马，或者把应得的马价抽出来，这样自己就可以保留一部分“固定资产”。一种以周广文为代表，他家有6公顷1亩5分地，转高级社取消地租以后，每年要减少六石粮的土地报酬，按市价值107元。第三种是李向财，他靠着自己有两匹马一辆车入社，便不好好参加劳动，今年才得30多个劳动日。支部委员会根据上述情况，针对各种人的不同思想进行了不同的教育。
    三、处理具体问题
    各种思想问题解决以后，才开始报名转入高级社。报名的情况很热烈。报名完毕，接着是审查社员，选举管理委员会。共选了管理委员21人（其中四户贫农，十一户下中农，六户上中农），监察委员会委员三人（都是贫农和下中农）。为了加强新社的领导，呼兰县委在取得社员的同意下，委派这个区原来的区委第二书记杜得宝为社主任，村支部书记朱万有当选为副主任。就这样，新的机构产生了。
    在第一次社员大会上，通过了临时拟定的社章和原来各社的公共财产一律归社公有的决议；确定股份基金的数目和分摊办法。生产费用、股份基金是按1956年农业生产所需的种子、肥料、草料的费用计算出来的，和原来各社留下的生产费用的数量大致相抵。公有化股份基金（主要是车马和一部分农具的折价费）是按劳力摊，社员把自己的车马农具作价入社后，按应缴纳的股份基金数量，多退少补，少数贫苦老弱的社员，可以免交。有劳力但贫苦交不起的，可以缓交，由社代为申请借用贫农合作基金。
    四、迎接大生产
    燎原农业合作社建成后的第一次管理委员会，解决了劳动组织和生产计划的问题。全社划分了五个生产队：三个旱田生产队，一个水田生产队，一个副业生产队。按照计划，1956年每公顷产量将增加到4，440斤原粮。为了作好生产准备工作，他们在转社前后，已经挖了水田的田埂5，700公尺，又和邻近村一起挖水壕300公尺，还倒了300公顷的粪；他们一天也没有间断秋翻地，已完成了秋翻地270公顷，超过了原订计划70公顷。这就为转高级社后第一年的丰收打下了有利基础。
