Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 31st: TASS Moscow, December 31st - Soviet Minister Council Chairman N.A. Bulganin answered questions raised by Charles Shotte, Washington Branch Chief of "Press Wireless, Inc.". The following is his reply:

	Question: Do you believe that the "Geneva spirit" demonstrated at the four-power summit conference in July of this year still exists and will continue to exist?

	Answer: The historical significance of the Geneva four-power summit lies in the spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding shown by the participants, which created a realistic possibility for improving relations between countries and fostered the prospect of safeguarding lasting international peace.

	People of all countries desire peace and hate war. They demand that the "Geneva spirit," which has aroused hope for peace and a better future, be strengthened and expanded, and that hope for peace and a better future also grows and consolidates.

	Precisely because of this, we believe that the work done at the Geneva meeting of the heads of state of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, which has already played an important role in improving the international situation, cannot be buried.

	Question: Given that the recent Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has effectively reached a deadlock, what are your views on convening a new four-power summit conference?

	Answer: Although it is known that the Foreign Ministers' Conference did not reach mutually agreed resolutions on the issues discussed, the conference did further clarify the positions of the participants, which will help to resolve these issues in the future.

	Regarding a new four-power summit conference, such a conference could be effective, provided that all participants give due consideration to the interests of all parties concerned when studying pressing international issues.

	Question: Many observers in the United States and abroad believe that the "atomic stalemate" is a result of both the East and West possessing thermonuclear weapons. Do you think that these terrible weapons might naturally eliminate the possibility of a terrible hydrogen bomb war? What are your views?

	Answer: If we are talking about an "atomic stalemate," it is certainly not a result of the existence of thermonuclear weapons. The reason that the issue of banning atomic and thermonuclear weapons has not yet been resolved is the unwillingness of some countries to agree to the prohibition of atomic and thermonuclear weapons.

	As for the Soviet Union, it has always advocated disarmament and the reduction of armed forces, unconditionally banning atomic and thermonuclear weapons, and establishing effective international supervision to implement relevant resolutions on this issue. Passing such resolutions would relieve people of all countries from the fear of new wars, end the heavy burden of the arms race, and enable all resources of countries to be shifted to peaceful development and improving the welfare of the people.

	It is incorrect to think that the possibility of thermonuclear war will naturally be eliminated because both the East and the West possess hydrogen weapons. Such statements can in fact numb the vigilance of the people of all countries who advocate eliminating the threat of atomic war.

	Of course, the fact that it is currently impossible to use atomic and hydrogen weapons with impunity has a certain deterrent effect on those who wish to launch wars using weapons of mass destruction. The dangerous argument that peace can seemingly be maintained by strengthening "atomic power" and continuing the arms race is being spread by these people.

	It is clear that the arms race, including the race in atomic weapons, will not only not weaken but will also strengthen the threat of a new war. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that the way out of the so-called atomic stalemate is not to continue the arms race, but to make new efforts to reach an agreement on banning atomic weapons and striving to stop the expansion of armaments.

	Question: In your opinion, what are the prospects for peace in the new year?

	Answer: In the past year, the forces that have consistently and actively strived to ease international tensions and consolidate peace and international friendship have achieved great success. Many people who previously had doubts about this now understand that in our time, international cooperation and trust are fully achievable goals. There is no doubt that if the governments of all countries, especially the governments of major powers, practically strive for further easing of international tensions and strengthening of trust between countries, taking into account the irresistible desire of all countries for peace, then in 1956, new achievements will be made in the struggle to stop the "Cold War," ease international tensions, and build trust between countries.

	Question: Would you like to say a few words of greetings to the people of the world, especially the American people?

	Answer: I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warm greetings to the American people and offer my best wishes for the New Year. Historical experience has proven that the people of our two countries can live together in peace and friendship. Developing and strengthening friendly mutual understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union will be a great contribution to the cause of consolidating universal peace.

　　布尔加宁答美国记者问
    新华社31日讯　塔斯社莫斯科31日电：苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁回答了“电讯通讯社”华盛顿分社社长查·萧特所提的问题，以下就是他的答复：
    问：你是否认为，今年7月四国政府首脑会议所表现出来的日内瓦精神仍然存在，并且将继续存在？
    答：日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的历史性意义在于，会议参加者所表现的合作和互相谅解精神，为改善各国之间的关系创造了现实的可能性，造成了保障国际持久和平的前景。
    各国人民希望和平，憎恨战争。他们要求引起了对于和平和美好的未来的希望的日内瓦精神增强和扩大，对和平和美好前途的希望也随着增长和巩固了。
    正是因为这样，我们相信，苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑日内瓦会议所做的、已在改善国际局势方面发挥了重要作用的工作，是埋葬不了的。
    问：鉴于不久以前的日内瓦外交部长会议事实上已经陷于僵局，你对于召开新的四国政府首脑会议有什么意见？
    答：虽然大家知道外交部长会议没有就所讨论的问题取得彼此都同意的决议，然而这次会议却使得会议参加者的立场进一步明确地表现出来，这就会有助于这些问题在将来获得解决。
    关于谈到新的四国政府首脑会议，那么这种会议是可能有成效的，当然这首先要会议的所有参加者在研究迫切的国际问题时，恰如其分地考虑到一切有关方面的利益。
    问：美国和外国有许多观察家认为，原子僵局是东西双方都拥有热核子武器的结果。这种可怕的武器是否可能自然而然地消除可怖的氢弹战争的可能性，你的意见怎样？
    答：如果谈到“原子僵局”，那么这绝不是热核子武器存在的结果。禁止原子武器和热核子武器问题至今仍然没有取得解决，是某些国家不愿意同意禁止原子武器和热核子武器的结果。
    至于苏联，它是一贯主张裁减军备和武装部队，主张无条件地禁止原子武器和热核子武器，并且主张为实现关于这个问题的相应决议而建立有效的国际监督的。通过这样的决议，就能解除各国人民对新战争的恐惧，终止负担沉重的军备竞赛，并且能使各国的全部资源都转而用于和平发展和提高人民的福利。
    如果认为，由于东方和西方都拥有氢武器，热核子战争的可能性就会自然而然地消除，那是不正确的。这一类说法事实上能够麻痹主张消除原子战争威胁的各国人民的警惕性。
    当然，在目前情况之下已经不可能不受惩罚地使用原子武器和氢武器这一事实，对于那些希望利用大规模毁灭性武器来发动战争的人，是有一定程度的抑制作用的。那种认为似乎可以通过加强“原子威力”和继续军备竞赛的办法来保持和平的危险论调，正是从这些人士中传播出来的。
    很明显，军备竞赛，其中包括原子武器方面的竞赛，不仅不会削弱、反而会加强新战争的威胁。因此，苏联认为所谓原子僵局的出路不是继续军备竞赛，而是为达成禁止原子武器的协议和争取停止扩充军备作新的努力。
    问：你认为，在新的一年中，和平的前景如何？
    答：在过去的一年中，一贯积极地争取缓和国际紧张局势、争取巩固和平和国际友谊的力量取得了很大的成就。许多过去对这一点有怀疑的人现在已经明白，在我们的时代里，国际合作和信任是一个完全可以实现的目标。没有疑问，如果各国政府，首先是大国政府，考虑各国人民对和平的不可抑制的渴望实际地争取国际紧张局势的进一步缓和和国与国之间的信任的加强，那么在1956年中，争取停止“冷战”、争取缓和国际紧张局势、争取建立国与国之间的信任的斗争将会取得新的成就。
    问：你愿意对世界人民，特别是美国人民，致一点什么祝词吗？
    答：我愿乘这个机会向美国人民热烈致意，并且致最好的新年祝愿。历史经验证明，我们两国人民能够和平友好地相处。发展和加强美国和苏联之间友好的相互谅解，将是对巩固普遍和平的事业的巨大贡献。
