To the Editorial Board,
To the veteran workers of farm implement factories across the country:

Reading your letter to our farmer brothers nationwide filled us with immense joy, strengthening our confidence and resolve to follow the path of collectivization and fulfill our agricultural production increase plans.

For the past three years, under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have developed cooperatives, with yields increasing year after year. This is inseparable from your strong support. In Zhang Wenbing Cooperative of Gaoli District, the 210 mu of wheat irrigated by waterwheels made by you yielded 80 jin per mu more than the unirrigated land. The double-wheeled double-shared plows plow the land deeply and thoroughly, not only increasing grain production but also saving labor and animal power.

With the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperation, we feel that new farm implements are still too few. In our county, some cooperatives do not have waterwheels at all, and double-wheeled double-shared plows are also insufficient. Some cooperatives have scoured neighboring supply and marketing cooperatives to buy waterwheels and double-wheeled double-shared plows, but still cannot find them. Your proposal in the letter to do your best to manufacture more new types of farm implements that suit our needs and are possible to manufacture is exactly what we hope for.

Dear veteran worker comrades, in order to strive to complete the five-year agricultural production increase plan in four years, our entire county has launched a large-scale production increase competition. Each agricultural cooperative is striving to make greater achievements in all aspects, such as building water conservancy projects, expanding irrigated areas, opening up fertilizer sources, protecting draft animals, improving technology, changing farming systems, increasing the planting of high-yield crops, fighting natural disasters, and eliminating the "four pests." From the autumn harvest to mid-December, the county has already dug more than 7,000 wells, irrigating nearly 80,000 mu of wheat. We, representing more than 49,000 members, guarantee to increase the production of more grain and industrial raw materials to support the national industrialization cause!

### 对农具制造厂职工的期望

    对农具制造厂职工的期望编辑同志转全国各农具工厂的职工老大哥们：
    看到你们给全国农民兄弟的信，心里无比高兴，使我们走合作化道路和完成农业增产计划的信心和决心更大了。
    三年以来，我们在党和毛主席的指示下，发展了合作社，产量一年比一年提高。这同你们的大力帮助是分不开的。高里区张文炳社用你们制造的水车浇的210亩小麦，每亩就比不浇的地增产80斤。双轮双铧犁耕地又深又透，不但可以增产粮食，还节省了劳力和畜力。
    在农业合作化高潮到来的时候，我们感到新农具还是太少了。在我们县里，有的社根本还没有水车，双轮双铧犁也不够用。有的社为了买水车和双轮双铧犁，跑遍了近邻的供销合作社，还是买不到。你们在信中提出今后要尽力多制造各种适合我们需要而又可能制造的新式农具，正是我们的希望。
    亲爱的工人老大哥，为了争取在四年内完成五年农业增产计划，我们全县已经开展了大规模的增产竞赛。各个农业社都争取要在兴修水利、扩大浇地面积、开辟肥源、保护耕畜、改进技术、改变耕作制度、增种高产作物、同自然灾害作斗争以及清除“四害”等各方面做出更大的成绩。从秋收以后到12月中旬为止，全县已经打井七千多眼，浇麦子近八万亩。我们代表49，000多名社员提出保证，一定要增产更多的粮食和工业原料，来支援国家工业化的事业！
