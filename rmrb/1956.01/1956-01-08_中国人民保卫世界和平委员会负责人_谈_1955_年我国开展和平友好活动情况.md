Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The person in charge of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace told Xinhua News Agency reporters today: 1955 was a year of significant achievements for people of all countries in the cause of defending peace and promoting friendly cooperation among peoples. In this year, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace received more than four hundred peace representatives from 36 countries around the world. We are particularly pleased to have received for the first time a widely representative delegation of nearly one hundred people from the Middle East and North African Arab countries.

　　Among these representatives were people from different political parties and religious leaders and devout believers of different faiths, as well as members of parliament, leaders of trade unions, women, youth, students, professors, primary and secondary school teachers, scientists, writers, artists, doctors, lawyers, journalists, industrialists, businessmen, and housewives. Among them were many famous international peace fighters and public leaders visiting our country for the first time, such as Pietro Nenni, Secretary-General of the Italian Socialist Party and Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council; D.N. Pritt, Chairman of the British Peace Committee and President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers; Alexander Korneichuk, a famous Soviet writer; Isabelle Blume, a Belgian social activist and Standing Committee member and Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council; and Mr. Moreira Alves, a member of the Brazilian National Congress and Secretary-General of the Brazilian Labour Party.

　　The person in charge said: The Chinese people welcomed peace-loving friends from all countries with warm hearts. They could freely choose the places they wished to go and make extensive contacts with people from all walks of life in China. Some delegations visited the northwest and southwest border regions of our country. After their visits, they all unanimously stated that they did not see any "iron curtain" or "bamboo curtain" in China. What they saw with their own eyes was that the Chinese people are enthusiastically engaged in huge peaceful construction and are marching towards a happy and beautiful socialist society with full confidence. They generally acknowledged that the Chinese people love peace and are willing to cooperate friendly with people of all countries in the world. Mr. Alaya, head of the Tunisian Friendship Delegation to China, said: "How can such large-scale construction as that in Northeast China not be peaceful construction?" Mrs. Lees, a member of the British Friends Service Council delegation who had lived in China for more than 20 years, also said that she found that the hygiene, clothing, and living conditions of the Chinese people had greatly improved and felt that China is currently an orderly country with the rule of law, which was an impression she had never had in all those years.

　　The peace representatives of various countries unanimously praised China's religious freedom and the unity and equality of all nationalities. Sheikh Ahmad Al-Assal, a famous Syrian Islamic theologian and winner of the 1955 Stalin International Prize for "Strengthening International Peace," said: "Religious belief is completely free in China." Dr. José Giral, Chairman of the Spanish Peace Committee, said: "No religion is persecuted in China. Buddhists and Muslims, Christians and Catholics coexist, and they all hold their own religious ceremonies." Mr. Tal, former Speaker of the Jordanian Parliament, said: "Seeing the unity of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and their happy lives, we know that the Chinese government cares about the welfare of all ethnic groups."

　　The person in charge also said: In response to the call of the World Peace Council, our country commemorated Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, German poet and playwright Friedrich Schiller, French philosopher Montesquieu, and Danish fairy tale writer Hans Christian Andersen in 1955, as well as the 100th anniversary of the publication of Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass," the 350th anniversary of the publication of Miguel de Cervantes' "Don Quixote," and the 1,500th anniversary of the Ajanta frescoes in India. When commemorating these world cultural celebrities, masterpieces, and famous paintings, we also invited representatives from many relevant countries to China to participate in these commemorative activities and visits.

　　The person in charge said that in this year, the Chinese people also organized many peace delegations to participate in various international peace conferences and sent many representatives to visit various countries. The Chinese delegation participated in the "Asian Countries Conference" held in New Delhi, India in April 1955, the "World Peace Conference" held in Helsinki, Finland in June, and the "World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" held in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Osaka, Tokyo and other places in Japan in August, and the "Meeting of Politicians and Social Activists from Eastern and Western Countries" held in Lyon, France in October; and attended meetings of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, etc. The Chinese delegation was the first to go to India, Japan, France, and other countries to participate in conferences and visits, and was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people in these countries. At these meetings, the Chinese delegation expressed the Chinese people's desire and determination to defend world peace and promote friendly cooperation among the people of all countries.

　　The person in charge concluded by saying: Defending world peace, promoting friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, and developing cultural and economic exchanges among countries are the common aspirations of the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world. We believe that this great cause will achieve even greater victories in the new year of 1956 with the further efforts of peace-loving people all over the world. In the new year, we will receive more peace-loving people from all countries and carry out more extensive peace and friendship activities. We Chinese people will prove with more facts that the new China will always be a faithful friend of all peace-loving countries and people.

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会负责人
　　谈1955年我国开展和平友好活动情况
    新华社7日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会负责人今天向新华社记者发表谈话说：1955年是世界各国人民在保卫和平和促进各国人民友好合作的事业中取得重大成就的一年。在这一年中，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会接待了来自世界各地的属于36个国家的四百多位和平代表。我们特别高兴的，是第一次接待了中近东和北非阿拉伯国家近百人的具有广泛代表性的代表团。
    在这些代表中，有属于不同政治党派的人士和不同信仰的宗教界领袖和虔诚的教徒，也有各国国会议员和工会、妇女、青年、学生各界的领袖以及教授、中小学教员、科学家、作家、艺术家、医生、律师、新闻记者、工商业家、家庭妇女等。在他们当中，还有不少第一次来我国访问的著名的国际和平战士和公众领袖，如意大利社会党总书记、世界和平理事会副主席南尼，英国和平委员会会长、国际民主法律工作者协会主席普里特，苏联名作家考涅楚克，比利时社会活动家、世界和平理事会常务委员兼书记处书记布伦姆夫人，巴西国会议员、巴西劳工党总书记摩雷拉等。
    负责人说：中国人民以热烈的心情来欢迎各国的和平友人，他们可以自由地选择他们所愿意去的地方，同中国各阶层人士广泛接触；有些代表团到了我国西北和西南边疆地区参观访问。他们在参观访问后，都一致表示在中国并没有看见什么“铁幕”或“竹幕”。他们亲眼看到的是中国人民正热情地从事于巨大的和平建设，正信心百倍地向幸福美好的社会主义社会迈进。他们公认中国人民是热爱和平并且愿与全世界各国人民友好合作的。突尼斯访华友好代表团团长阿莱亚说：“像中国东北这样大规模的建设，怎么能不是和平建设呢？”英国公谊会代表团团员、曾在中国旅居20多年的李斯夫人也表示，她发现中国人民的卫生、衣著和居住条件都有了很大的改善，觉得中国目前是一个法治的有秩序的国家，这些都是她过去那么多年中从来没有得到过的印象。
    各国和平代表们一致赞扬中国的宗教信仰自由和各民族的团结平等。叙利亚著名伊斯兰教阿訇、1955年“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人穆哈默德·阿契玛尔说：“宗教信仰在中国是完全自由的。”西班牙和平委员会主席何塞·希拉尔博士说：“在中国并没有一种宗教遭受到迫害。佛教徒和伊斯兰教徒，基督教徒和天主教徒都同时存在，他们都各自举行他们自己的宗教仪式。”约旦前国会议长塔尔说：“在新疆看到各族人民团结一致，过着幸福生活，我们知道了中国人民政府是关心各族人民的福利的。”
    负责人又说：为了响应世界和平理事会的号召，我国在1955年先后纪念了波兰诗人密茨凯维奇、德国诗人与戏剧家席勒、法国哲学家孟德斯鸠和丹麦童话作家安徒生，以及美国诗人惠特曼的“草叶集”出版一百周年、西班牙作家塞万提斯的“堂·吉诃德”出版三百五十周年和印度阿旃陀壁画一千五百周年。在纪念这些世界文化名人、名著和名画的时候，我们还邀请了许多有关国家的代表来我国参加这些纪念活动和参观访问。
    负责人说，在这一年中，中国人民同时也组织了许多和平代表团参加各种国际和平会议，派出了许多代表到各国参观访问。中国代表团曾参加了1955年4月间在印度新德里举行的“亚洲国家会议”，6月间在芬兰赫尔辛基举行的“世界和平大会”，8月间在日本广岛、长崎、大阪、东京等地举行的“禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会”，10月间在法国里昂举行的“东西方各国政治家和社会活动家会见会”；并且出席了世界和平理事会常务委员会会议等。中国代表团是第一次到印度、日本和法国等国参加会议和参观访问，受到了这些国家的广大人民的热烈欢迎。中国代表团在这些会议上，表达了中国人民对保卫世界和平和促进各国人民友好合作的愿望和决心。
    负责人最后说：保卫世界和平，促进各国人民间的友好合作，发展各国文化、经济交流，是中国人民和全世界各国人民的共同愿望。我们相信，这一伟大事业在1956年新的一年中，在全世界爱好和平的人民的进一步努力下，定将获得更大的胜利。在新的一年中，我们将接待更多的各国和平人士、展开更广泛的和平友好活动。我们中国人民将以更多的事实来证明：新中国永远是一切爱好和平的国家和人民的忠实朋友。
