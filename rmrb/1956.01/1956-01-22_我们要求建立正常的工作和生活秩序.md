    We Demand the Establishment of a Normal Work and Life Order
    Opinions from some staff members in Tianjin

    The phenomenon of not being able to reasonably guarantee the spare time of staff members exists to a considerable extent in some Tianjin organizations. The following is a reflection of the situation from some comrades in the Tianjin Planning Commission, Statistics Bureau, Reception Office, Grain Bureau, Heping District People's Committee, and Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League:

    Busy and Chaotic Phenomena Affect Work, Study, and Life

    The staff of the Tianjin Planning Commission have had to work overtime almost every night for more than half a year, sometimes even working all night; their Sundays have also become almost statutory working days. Comrades in the Industrial Division, for example, have only had three or four Sundays off since August 1955. In the Civil Affairs Section of the Heping District People's Committee, using evenings or Sundays for work seems to have become a system. Some days, staff members even have to go to work two hours early; initially, some comrades raised objections, but over time, they had to "obey" the "needs" of work. Some comrades in the Reception Office once went 18 consecutive Sundays without rest. In addition, similar situations exist to varying degrees in the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and other units.

    Spare-Time Study Cannot Proceed Normally

    The adverse consequences of busy and chaotic work, in addition to staff members not getting the rest, recreation, and time to take care of family life they deserve, also severely affect their studies. For example, among the 200 staff members of the Heping District People's Committee and its subordinate units who participate in spare-time cultural studies, 50 have retained their student status because they have been unable to attend classes for a long time; of the 120 people who participated in the mid-term exams this semester, only about 20 were able to pass on average in each course. The learning in the Reception Office never catches up, so the comrades have put forward the slogan "books never leave the bosom"; but in the case of busy and chaotic work, even if the books never leave the bosom, there is still no time to read them. Comrades from the Tianjin Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Russian Language Specialty Night School also provided this situation: This semester, 740 people in the city participated in night school study; these comrades were all sent to school after being reviewed by their units, who believed that they could guarantee their study time; but shortly after the start of the semester, because of frequently attending meetings and crash work, about 30% of all students were unable to persist in their studies. According to a recent survey conducted by the Russian language broadcast lectures in 97 units, for the same reason, more than 58% of the students are unable to persist in their studies.

    Work Quality is Affected

    Regular overtime also affects work quality. Comrades from the Statistics Bureau said: Working too long, the mind is dizzy, statistical figures often make mistakes, and as a result, they have to be reworked, which is really not worth the loss! Because of rushing to complete tasks all day long, there is no research into the statistics at all, so the work situation is often "there are numbers on the table, but no numbers in the heart." In addition, the comrades simply have no time to go deep into the grassroots units to help improve statistical work, which also prevents the quality and efficiency of the entire statistical work from improving quickly.

    How to Establish a Normal Work and Life Order

    Many comrades have proposed: When the motherland is building socialism, work should be intense; sometimes, in order to complete an urgent task, accidentally occupying some spare time, everyone will certainly not have any objections. But the current work situation in some organizations is not normal intensity, but unnecessary busyness and chaos—in the words of the comrades in the Civil Affairs Section of the Heping District People's Committee, it is "busy for nothing." This phenomenon can be improved completely as long as the causes are found and resolved.

    Strengthen Planning, Improve Working Methods

    The fact that the leading comrades of some organizations are not good at arranging work and do not pay attention to working methods is an important reason for the busy and chaotic phenomenon. For example, the comrades in the Civil Affairs Section of the Heping District People's Committee reflected: Not long ago, in the work of distributing cotton clothing relief to poor households, the deputy section chief assigned everyone to work overtime to investigate and compile materials related to the distribution of cotton clothing; after the work was completed, the section chief believed that the method of investigation and statistics was not right, and the comrades had to rework it. The leaders of the Heping District Military Service Conscription Office sometimes let the staff come to work overtime in the evening to "sort out" the work of the day; in fact, some people do not have any work to sort out, but they also sit and wait until after 10 o'clock before they can go home. One Sunday, the leader of this office asked two comrades to work overtime to stencil a document; after the stencil was written, he thought that mimeographing was not as beautiful as typing, and as a result, he asked the typist to retype the document on Monday. Still in this office, the leader's method of assigning work to the staff is to put forward one item in the morning, another item in the afternoon, and then say in the evening that there is some "crash" task that needs overtime; if these three items are all put forward at the beginning of the day, the staff can arrange them in a unified manner and can completely complete them during the working hours of the day. There are also some leading comrades who say that some things that can be postponed are also "as urgent as a fire," and they must rush everyone to work overtime to do them. For example, the leader of the Industrial Division of the Planning Commission arranged an "urgent" task on New Year's Eve in 1955, which was not actually to be completed that day, and made the comrades work until three or four o'clock in the night.

    Do Not Hold Unprepared and Repetitive Meetings

    Randomly convening unnecessary meetings and unprepared meetings is another important reason for the busy and chaotic work. For example, the Civil Affairs Section of the Heping District People's Committee once held a meeting on Sunday to summarize the work, but the section chief and deputy section chief, the two leaders, did not exchange opinions in advance and did not do a good job of preparation, so the two people disagreed at the meeting and argued, and the meeting lasted all morning without any results. For another example, the comrades of the Grain Bureau said that their organization often holds some unnecessary meetings of all sizes, such as opening many meetings with repetitive content in order to carry out sports activities; obviously, it is completely possible to solve the problem without holding so many meetings.

    Work Should Be Arranged Rationally

    In addition, the unreasonable arrangement of work by the higher authorities is also one of the reasons for the busyness and chaos of the lower-level organs. The comrades of the Tianjin Planning Commission reflected that many departments often ask them for various statistical materials and planning forms, and they all say that they are "urgently needed," which makes the comrades have to work overtime. In fact, some materials and forms are often accumulated in the higher authorities. Once, a leading organ in Tianjin asked the Planning Commission for the figures on the means of production and consumer goods in Tianjin, and as a result, the Planning Commission mobilized a large number of people to rush to calculate them overnight; the next day, this organ found that the Tianjin Statistics Bureau already had this figure, and the labor of the Planning Commission comrades for one night was completely wasted.

### 我们要求建立正常的工作和生活秩序

    我们要求建立正常的工作和生活秩序
    天津市一部分机关工作人员的意见
    机关工作人员业余时间不能得到合理保证的现象，在天津市有一些机关里也相当严重地存在着。下面，是天津市计划委员会、统计局、交际处、粮食局、和平区人民委员会和青年团天津市委会等单位一部分同志反映的情况：忙乱现象影响了工作、学习和生活
    天津市计划委员会的工作人员，半年多以来差不多每天晚上都要加班，有时甚至要工作一个通宵；他们的星期日也几乎成了法定的工作日。像工业处的同志们从1955年8月以来，只有三、四个星期天没有加班。在和平区人民委员会民政科，占用晚间或星期日的业余时间进行工作似乎已经成了一种制度。有些日子工作人员还要提早两个钟头上班；起初有一些同志还提出意见，但是时间长了，他们也只好“服从”工作“需要”了。交际处有些同志曾经连续18个星期日得不到休息。此外，在青年团市委会等单位，也程度不同地存在着类似的情况。
    业余学习不能正常进行
    工作忙乱所造成的恶果，除了工作人员不能得到应有的休息、娱乐和照料家庭生活的时间以外，还使工作人员的学习受到了严重的影响。例如，和平区人民委员会及所属基层单位参加业余文化学习的工作人员共200人，因为长期不能上课而保留学籍的有50人；参加本学期期中考试的120人中，各门课程平均起来能够及格的只有20人左右。交际处的学习始终赶不上进度，于是同志们就提出了“书本不离怀”的口号；但是在工作忙乱的情况下，即使书本不离怀，仍然没有时间看。天津市中苏友好协会俄文专科夜校的同志还提供了这样的情况：本学期全市参加夜校学习的有740人，这些同志都是经过本单位审查，认为可以保证他们的学习时间而保送入学的；但开学后不久，因为经常出席会议、突击工作而不能坚持学习的就占全体学员的30％左右。根据俄语广播讲座最近在97个单位所进行的调查，因为同样原因不能坚持学习的学员占学员人数的58％以上。
    工作质量受到了影响
    经常加班，还影响了工作质量。统计局的同志就说：工作时间太长，脑子昏昏沉沉，统计数字就经常出差错，结果又得返工，真是得不偿失！由于一天到晚赶任务，对统计出来的数字根本不进行研究，因此工作情况经常是“表上有数，心中无数”。此外，同志们根本没有时间深入基层单位，帮助改进统计工作，也使整个统计工作的质量和效率不能很快提高。
    怎样才能建立正常的工作和生活秩序
    不少同志提出：在祖国建设社会主义的时候，工作应当是紧张的；有时为了完成一项紧急任务，偶然占用一些业余时间，大家也决不会有什么意见。但是目前某些机关的工作情况并不是正常的紧张，而是不必要的忙乱——用和平区人民委员会民政科的同志的话来讲，是“忙得非常冤枉”。这种现象，只要找出原因，加以解决，是完全可以改善的。
    加强计划性，改进工作方法
    某些机关的领导同志不善于安排工作，不注意工作方法，是造成忙乱现象的一个重要原因。例如，和平区人民委员会民政科的同志反映：不久以前，他们在发放贫困户棉衣救济工作中，副科长布置大家加班去调查和统计有关棉衣发放的材料；工作做完了，正科长又认为调查统计工作的方法不对头，同志们只得重新返工。和平区兵役征集办公室的领导人有时让工作人员们晚上来加班“整理”当天的工作；实际上有些人并没有什么工作需要整理，但是也坐等到10点多钟才能回家去。有一个星期日，这个办公室的领导人叫两个同志加班刻印一个材料；在腊纸写好以后，他又认为油印不如打字美观，结果到星期一又叫打字员重打这个材料。还是在这个办公室，领导人向工作人员布置工作的方法是上午提出一项，下午提出一项，而到晚上又说有什么“突击”任务需要加班；如果这三项工作在一天开始的时候都提出来，工作人员统一安排，在当天工作时间是完全可以做好的。还有一些领导同志把一些可以缓办的事情也说成“急如星火”，非要大家加班赶着做不可。像计划委员会工业处的领导人在1955年除夕布置了一项实际上并不是当天就要完成的“紧急”任务，让同志们工作到夜里三、四点钟。
    不开无准备的和重复的会议
    随便召开不必要的会议和无准备的会议，是造成工作忙乱的另一项重要原因。例如，和平区人民委员会民政科有一次在星期日召开总结工作的会议，但是正副科长这两个领导人在事先并没有交换意见，做好准备工作，以致两个人在会上意见不一致，发生争执，开了一个上午的会就没有得到任何结果。又如，粮食局的同志谈，他们的机关经常开一些不必要的大大小小的会议，像为了开展体育活动就开了许多次内容重复的会；显然，不开那样多的会议，也是完全可以解决问题的。
    应该合理布置工作
    此外，上级机关布置工作不合理也是造成下级机关忙乱的原因之一。天津市计划委员会的同志反映，有很多部门经常向他们索要各种各样的统计材料和计划表报，而且都说是“紧急需要”，使得同志们不得不加班。实际上，有些材料和表报到了上级机关，往往被积压起来。有一次，天津市某领导机关向计划委员会索取有关天津市生产资料和消费资料的数字，结果计划委员会就动员大批人力通宵赶着算出来了；第二天这个机关才发现天津市统计局已经有这个数字，计划委员会同志们一晚的劳动完全是白费的。
