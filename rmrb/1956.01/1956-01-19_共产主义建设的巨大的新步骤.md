    Great New Steps in Communist Construction
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union
    The inspiring Sixth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union, with its magnificent and far-reaching vision and scale, and its rapid pace and speed, attracts and inspires the people of the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people around the world.
    "Pravda," in summarizing the voices of the Soviet people after the promulgation of the new Five-Year Plan, wrote: "Millions of Soviet people, in these days, are studying and discussing the draft instructions, pondering its content, and thinking about every figure. They, the fully empowered masters of their own country, are declaring their unwavering will to realize the Sixth Five-Year Plan, thereby taking a new and giant step in the development of the socialist economy and in the creation of abundant consumer goods and communist construction."
    The Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan, with its charming figures and brilliant provisions, unfolds a very broad perspective before people. The Sixth Five-Year Plan means that the Soviet Union's national economy, first and foremost heavy industry, will have a new and powerful upsurge; the Soviet Union's economic strength and its indestructible defense capabilities will be further strengthened; the people's material interests and cultural level will be greatly improved. In this historically significant new period, the Soviet Union will develop so rapidly to such an extent that it is not only prepared with an unprecedentedly solid material foundation for the transition to a communist society, but also obtains all the necessary conditions to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product production in a shorter period of time through peaceful economic competition.
    The Soviet planning advances on an unprecedented scale and speed that breaks with convention—this is precisely what excites us and frustrates the Western bourgeoisie. Which capitalist country in the world can achieve the Soviet Union's ability to increase the production of pig iron, steel, and coal by more than half, increase the production of oil and electricity by nearly double, and increase machine manufacturing and metal processing by about 80% in the next 5 years? When Western bourgeois newspapers see that Soviet industrial production will grow by another 65% in 5 years, and that the number of specialized talents trained by the Soviet Union will increase greatly, they cannot but admit that the Soviet Union will catch up with the most developed capitalist countries in a short period of time.
    In the overall plan of the Soviet national economy, electrification is one of the most moving projects. Power generation—320 billion kilowatt-hours in 1960! (Readers, please compare—166 billion kilowatt-hours in 1955; 1.9 billion kilowatt-hours in 1913!) This means that in the next 5 years, powerful power will be added to industry, agriculture, transportation, and daily life. By 1960, many nuclear power plants will appear (with a total power generation of 2 million to 2.5 million kilowatts). By that time, on the Volga River alone, the Gorky Hydroelectric Station (400,000 kilowatts), the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station (2.1 million kilowatts), and the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station (2.31 million kilowatts) will be fully completed, and the Saratov Hydroelectric Station (1 million kilowatts) and the Cheboksary Hydroelectric Station (approximately 800,000 kilowatts) are under construction. By that time, the first part of the construction of the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station (3.2 million kilowatts) on the Angara River will be completed; and the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station (3.2 million kilowatts) is being built on the Yenisei River. Thus, two of the world's largest hydroelectric stations are being built in Siberia! If people were to travel to the Soviet Union in 1960, they would encounter many new factories, mines, and many industrial towns that have not yet been recorded on the map, especially in Siberia, Kazakhstan, and other eastern regions. People will see in the industrial enterprises throughout the Soviet Union how widely atomic energy and other scientific achievements are being used, developing electrification, complete mechanization, and automation, using the latest lathes and machines, and replacing outdated equipment. People will find that factories and workshops in various regions are so specialized and cooperate with each other: some produce castings, others produce forgings, some produce lathes, and others produce parts, and so on. People will also encounter more production innovators and advanced production experience.
    The proportion of the growth of the production of means of production and consumer goods in the new Five-Year Plan shows that prioritizing the development of heavy industry is the unwavering line of the Soviet Communist Party. Because it is the primary basis for ensuring the great development of all sectors of the national economy. If this policy had not been adhered to for more than 20 years, how could the national economy have such a linear prosperity and such rapid development from one five-year plan to the next? It is enough to recall the situation at the beginning of the first five-year plan, when the Soviet Union only produced about 3.3 million tons of pig iron, more than 4.2 million tons of steel, more than 35 million tons of coal, about 11.65 million tons of oil, and 5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually.
    In the Soviet Union's new Five-Year Plan, not only the manufacturing of atomic engines on icebreakers, but also the scale and speed of the development of not only industry but also agriculture, are worrying the bourgeoisie in the United States and certain Western countries. An editorial in the American "New York Times" said: The production of Soviet agricultural products and the productivity of agricultural labor are planned so high, "that is a revolution," and then hastily spread a skeptical tone, saying that it may not be possible to achieve it. We know that the Soviet Union's new Five-Year Plan proposes to produce 180 million tons (11 billion poods) of grain annually in 1960 and greatly increase the target of other agricultural products. This goal is a step higher than the goal of striving for an annual production of 10 billion poods proposed last January. This shows that socialist agriculture has huge development possibilities, which those who are frightened by the crisis of their own capitalist agricultural production cannot understand and are unwilling to understand. Soviet agricultural production will achieve new goals on the basis of the achievements already made, especially the vigorous development in the past two or three years, with the strong support of industry and the efforts of workers.
    In addition to the priority development of heavy industry and the continuous advancement of technology, the rise of labor productivity is the decisive condition for production development and the improvement of people's welfare. The plan sets very high targets for the improvement of labor productivity in various sectors of the national economy and even in collective farms. It reflects the superiority of the socialist economic system and the enthusiasm of Soviet workers in building communism. This draft five-year plan was discussed from the bottom up and made by concentrating the wisdom of the entire people. Naturally, it also contains the requirements of workers and peasants for greatly improving labor productivity.
    On the basis of the strong development of production, the material interests of the Soviet people and Soviet culture will have further significant development in the next 5 years. This shows that in socialist society, the development of production is aimed at meeting the needs of the people. The Sixth Five-Year Plan is marked by the further strong development of Soviet productive forces, which adds a solid guarantee to the future needs and long-term interests of the Soviet people.
    The Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan, like the past five plans, is a plan for peaceful construction. Just like the past plans, the great Soviet people, under the wise leadership of the enlightened Soviet Communist Party, will certainly be able to realize this great program.

    共产主义建设的巨大的新步骤
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    振奋人心的苏联发展国民经济的第六个五年计划，以它的雄伟远大的气魄和规模，以它的突飞猛进的步伐和速度，吸引和鼓舞着苏联全国人民，吸引和鼓舞着全世界爱好和平的人民。
    “真理报”在概括新的五年计划颁布以后苏联人民的声音时写道：“千百万苏联人，在这些日子里研究和讨论着指示草案，深思着它的内容，想想每一个数字。他们，自己国家的全权的主人，宣布着刚毅的意志，要实现第六个五年计划，从而在社会主义经济的发展上，在创造丰富的日用品上，在共产主义建设上迈进新的巨大的一步。”
    苏联第六个五年计划以具有魅力的数字和灿烂的规定，在人们面前展开一幅非常广阔的远景。第六个五年计划意味着苏联国民经济首先是重工业将有新的强大的高涨；苏联的经济力量和它的不可摧毁的国防力量将进一步加强；人民的物质利益和文化水平将大大提高。在这个有历史意义的新时期，苏联将飞速地发展到这样的程度，即它不单准备有过渡到共产主义社会的空前雄厚的物质基础，而且它取得一切必要条件，在较短期限内，经过和平的经济比赛，在按人口计算产品生产量方面，赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    苏联规划以突破常规的空前规模和速度前进，——这正是使我们兴奋和使西方资产阶级丧气的事情。苏联能够在今后5年中把铣铁、钢、煤的生产提高半倍以上，把石油和电力的生产提高近一倍，把机器制造和金属加工提高约80％，世界上有哪一个资本主义国家能够做到这一点呢？西方资产阶级报纸看到苏联工业生产在5年中又要增长65％，苏联培养的专门人材又要大大增加，也不得不承认苏联在短期内要赶过最发达的资本主义国家。
    在苏联国民经济的全面规划中，电气化是最动人的项目之一。发电量——1960年：3，200亿瓩！（读者请比较一下吧——1955年：1，660亿瓩；1913年：19亿瓩）这就是说，在今后5年中，在工业、农业、运输业和日常生活中又将增添强大的动力。到了1960年，许多原子能发电站出现了（发电力总计200万到250万瓩）。到那时候，仅仅在一条伏尔加河上，就有高尔基水电站（40万瓩）、古比雪夫水电站（210万瓩）、斯大林格勒水电站（231万瓩）完全建成，并且建筑着萨拉托夫水电站（100万瓩）和契鲍克萨利水电站（约80万瓩）。到那时候，在安加拉河上布拉次克水电站（320万瓩）的第一部工程完成；并且在叶尼塞河上建筑着克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站（320万瓩）。这样在一个西伯利亚就建筑着两个世界最大的水电站！要是在1960年人们到苏联作一次旅行，那么会遇到许多新的工厂、矿山以及地图上还来不及记载的许多工业城镇，特别是在西伯利亚、哈萨克斯坦等等东部地区。人们在苏联各地的工业企业中会见到那里多么广泛地利用着原子能和其他科学成就，发展着电气化、全盘机械化和自动化，使用着最新的车床和机器，更新着过时的设备。人们会发现各个地区的工厂和车间多么专业化和协作着：有些生产着铸件，另有些生产着锻件，还有些生产着车床，又有些生产着零件等等。人们也会遇见更多的生产革新者和先进生产经验。
    新的五年计划中生产资料和消费资料生产增长的比例说明，优先发展重工业是苏联共产党的确定不移的路线。因为它是保证国民经济所有部门大发展的首要根据。要不是20多年来坚持这个方针，国民经济怎么会有这样直线上升的繁荣，这样一个五年比一个五年的迅速发展呢？回忆一下第一个五年计划开始的时候的情形就够了，当时苏联不过年产约330万吨铣铁、420多万吨钢、3，500多万吨煤、约1，165万吨石油、50亿瓩时电力。
    在苏联新的五年计划中，不单破冰船上的原子发动机的制造，不单工业而且农业发展的规模和速度，都使美国和某些西方国家的资产阶级发愁。美国“纽约时报”的社论说：苏联农业品的生产和农业劳动生产率在计划中定的这么高，“那是革命”，接着赶紧散布怀疑的论调，说什么不见得能做得到。我们知道，苏联新的五年计划提出在1960年年产谷物1.8亿吨（110亿普特）和大大增加其他农产品的目标，这个目标比去年一月提出的争取年产100亿普特又高一步。这说明社会主义农业拥有巨大的发展可能性，这是那些被自己的资本主义农业生产危机吓住的人所不能了解也不愿了解的。苏联农业生产在已得成绩特别是最近两三年来大力发展的基础上，在强大的工业支持和劳动者努力之下，是会达到新目标的。
    除了重工业的优先发展和技术的不断进步之外，劳动生产率的高涨是生产发展和人民福利提高的决定性条件。计划中关于国民经济各部门甚至集体农庄的劳动生产率的提高，都定出很高的指标。它反映着社会主义经济制度的优越性和苏联劳动者建设共产主义的热情。这次五年计划草案是由下而上讨论，集中全体人民的智慧制成的，里面自然也包含工农劳动者关于大大提高劳动生产率的要求。
    在生产强大发展的基础上，苏联人民的物质利益和苏维埃文化在今后5年中将有进一步重大的发展。这说明，在社会主义社会里，生产的发展是以满足人民的需要为目的的。第六个五年计划是以苏联生产力进一步强大发展为标志的，这就为苏联人民的来日需要和长远利益增添着雄厚的保证。
    苏联第六个五年计划正如过去五次计划一样，是和平建设的计划。正如过去历次计划一样，伟大的苏联人民在英明的苏联共产党领导之下，一定能够实现这个巨大的纲领。
