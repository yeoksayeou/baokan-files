    Preface to "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside"
    (December 27, 1955)
    Mao Zedong

    This is a book of materials for people working in the countryside. Originally, I wrote a preface for this book in September. Now, three months have passed, and that preface is outdated, so I have to rewrite it.

    The matter is as follows: This book was edited twice: once in September and once in December. During the first editing, 121 pieces of material were collected. The situations reflected in these materials mostly concerned the first half of 1955, with a few from the second half of 1954. At that time, these materials were printed as samples and distributed to the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committees, Municipal Party Committees, Autonomous Region Party Committees, and Prefecture Party Committees who attended the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China from October 4 to 11, 1955, for their review and comments. They thought some materials needed to be added. After the meeting, most provinces, cities, and autonomous regions sent in supplementary materials. Among these materials, many reflected the situation in the second half of 1955. This required a re-editing. We deleted 30 pieces from the original 121 pieces, leaving 91 pieces, and selected 85 pieces from the newly received materials, totaling 176 pieces, about 900,000 words, which became the current version. All the materials included in this book have been slightly modified in terms of wording by the comrades responsible for editing; some annotations have been made for some terms that are not easy to understand; and a classified index has been made according to the nature of the problems. In addition, in order to criticize certain erroneous ideas and suggest certain things, we also wrote some editor's notes on some of the materials. To distinguish them from the editor's notes written by the editors of the original publications on some materials, we used the name "The Editors of This Book" for the editor's notes we wrote. Because these editor's notes were written twice, in September and December, there are some differences in tone.

    The problem is not simply in the materials. The problem is that in the second half of 1955, a fundamental change took place in China's situation. Among China's 110 million peasant households, by now—late December 1955—more than 60%, or over 70 million households, have responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and joined the semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives. In my report on the issue of agricultural cooperation on July 31, 1955, I mentioned that the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives was 16.9 million. In a few months, more than 50 million peasant households joined the cooperatives. This is a remarkable event. This event tells us that it will only take one year, 1956, to basically complete the semi-socialist cooperation in agriculture. In another three to four years, that is, by 1959 or 1960, we can basically complete the transition of cooperatives from semi-socialist to fully socialist. This event tells us that the socialist transformation of China's handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce should also be completed somewhat earlier in order to meet the needs of agricultural development. This event tells us that the scale and speed of China's industrialization, the scale and speed of the development of science, culture, education, health, and other undertakings, can no longer be done entirely according to what was originally planned. These should be appropriately expanded and accelerated.

    Is the progress of agricultural cooperation so fast proceeding in a healthy state? Absolutely yes. Party organizations in all places have comprehensively led this movement. The peasants are joining this movement with such enthusiasm and order. Their enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high. The broadest masses have seen their future clearly for the first time. When the three five-year plans are completed, that is, by 1967, the output of grain and many other agricultural crops may increase by 100% to 200% compared to the highest annual output before the founding of the People's Republic. Illiteracy can be eliminated in a relatively short period of time (for example, seven to eight years). Many diseases that are most harmful to the people, such as schistosomiasis, etc., which people used to think there was no way to deal with, now have ways to deal with. In short, the masses have seen their great future.

    The issue now presented to the whole Party and the people of the whole country is no longer the issue of criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking in the speed of the socialist transformation of agriculture. This issue has been resolved. Nor is it the issue of the speed of the overall public-private partnership in capitalist industry and commerce by industry. This issue has also been resolved. The issue of the speed of the socialist transformation of handicrafts should be discussed in the first half of 1956, and this issue will also be easily resolved. The problem now is not in these areas, but in other areas. Here there is agricultural production, industrial (including state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative-run) and handicraft production, the scale and speed of basic construction in industry and transportation, the coordination of commerce with other economic sectors, the coordination of science, culture, education, health, and other work with various economic undertakings, and so on. In these areas, there are shortcomings in underestimating the situation, which should be criticized and overcome to adapt to the development of the overall situation. People's thinking must adapt to the changed situation. Of course, no one can think wildly without basis, and no one can plan their actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, and do not try to do things that are really impossible to do. But the problem now is that right-leaning conservative thinking is causing trouble in many ways, making it impossible for work in many areas to adapt to the development of objective circumstances. The problem now is that there are many people who think that things that could have been done through hard work are impossible to do. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to constantly criticize those right-leaning conservative ideas that do exist.

    This book is for comrades working in the countryside. Can people in the city also take a look? Not only can they look, but they should look. This is a new thing. Just as new things are happening in socialist undertakings in the city every day and every hour, they are also happening in the countryside every day and every hour. What are the peasants doing? What is the relationship between what the peasants are doing and what the working class, intellectuals, and all patriotic people are doing? In order to understand these, it is helpful to look at the materials from the countryside.

    In order to enable more people to understand the current situation in the countryside, we plan to extract 44 pieces from the 176 pieces of material, about 270,000 words, and print an abridged version so that those who cannot read the entire book can also get in touch with this issue.

    “中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言
    （1955年12月27日）
    毛泽东
    这是一本材料书，供在农村工作的人们看的。本来在9月间就给这本书写好了一篇序言。到现在，过了三个月，那篇序言已经过时了，只好重新写一篇。
    事情是这样的。这本书编辑了两次：一次在9月，一次在12月。在第一次编辑的时候，收集了121篇材料。这些材料所反映的情况，大多数是1955年上半年的，少数是1954年下半年的。当时，曾经将这些材料印成样本，发给参加1955年10月4日至11日中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议（扩大）的各省委、市委、自治区党委和地委的负责同志阅看，请他们提出意见。他们认为需要补充一些材料。会后，大多数省、市和自治区送来了补充材料。在这些材料中间，有许多反映了1955年下半年的情况。这就需要重新编一次。我们从原有的121篇材料中删去了30篇，留下91篇，从新收材料中选出了85篇，共计176篇，约有90万字，成了现在这个本子。收在这本书里的所有的材料，都经负责编辑的几个同志在文字方面作了一些修改；对于一些不易看懂的名词，作了一些注解；又按问题的性质作了一个分类索引。除此以外，为了批判某些错误思想和建议某些东西，我们还在一部分材料上写了一点按语。为了区别于在有些材料上原来刊物的编者所写的按语，我们写的按语，用了“本书编者”的名义。这些按语因为是在9月和12月两次写的，故在语调上也就有了一些差别。
    问题还不是简单地在材料方面。问题是在1955年的下半年，中国的情况起了一个根本的变化。中国的一亿一千万农户中，到现在——1955年12月下旬——已有60％以上的农户，即七千多万户，响应中共中央的号召，加入了半社会主义的农业生产合作社。我在1955年7月31日所作关于农业合作化问题的报告中，提到加入合作社的农户数字是1，690万户，几个月时间，就有五千几百万农户加入了合作社。这是一件了不起的大事。这件事告诉我们，只需要1956年一个年头，就可以基本上完成农业方面的半社会主义的合作化。再有三年到四年，即到1959年，或者1960年，就可以基本上完成合作社由半社会主义到全社会主义的转变。这件事告诉我们，中国的手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，也应当争取提早一些时候去完成，才能适应农业发展的需要。这件事告诉我们，中国的工业化的规模和速度，科学、文化、教育、卫生等项事业的发展的规模和速度，已经不能完全按照原来所想的那个样子去做了，这些都应当适当地扩大和加快。
    农业合作化的进度这样快，是不是在一种健康的状态中进行的呢？完全是的。一切地方的党组织都全面地领导了这个运动。农民是那样热情而又很有秩序地加入这个运动。他们的生产积极性空前高涨。最广大的群众第一次清楚地看见了自己的将来。在三个五年计划完成的时候，即到1967年，粮食和许多其他农作物的产量，比较人民共和国成立以前的最高年产量，可能增加100％到200％。文盲可以在较短的时间内（例如七年至八年）加以扫除。许多危害人民最严重的疾病，例如血吸虫病等等，过去人们认为没有办法对付的，现在也有办法对付了。总之，群众已经看见了自己的伟大的前途。
    现在提到全党和全国人民面前的问题，已经不是批判在农业的社会主义改造速度方面的右倾保守思想的问题，这个问题已经解决了。也不是在资本主义工商业按行业实行全面公私合营的速度方面的问题，这个问题也已经解决了。手工业的社会主义改造的速度问题，在1956年上半年应当谈一谈，这个问题也会容易解决的。现在的问题，不是在这些方面，而是在其他方面。这里有农业的生产，工业（包括国营、公私合营和合作社营）和手工业的生产，工业和交通运输的基本建设的规模和速度，商业同其他经济部门的配合，科学、文化、教育、卫生等项工作同各种经济事业的配合等等方面。在这些方面，都是存在着对于情况估计不足的缺点的，都应当加以批判和克服，使之适应整个情况的发展。人们的思想必须适应已经变化了的情况。当然，任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。但是现在的问题，还是右倾保守思想在许多方面作怪，使许多方面的工作不能适应客观情况的发展。现在的问题是经过努力本来可以做到的事情，却有很多人认为做不到。因此，不断地批判那些确实存在的右倾保守思想，就有完全的必要了。
    这本书是给在农村工作的同志们看的。城市里的人是不是也可以看看呢？不但可以看，而且应当看。这是新事情。如同城市里每日每时都在发生社会主义事业的新事情一样，乡村里也在每日每时地发生着。农民在做些什么呢？农民所做的，同工人阶级、知识分子和一切爱国人士所做的有什么关系呢？为了要了解这些，看一看农村方面的材料是有好处的。
    为了使更多的人了解现在农村的情况，我们准备从176篇材料中抽出44篇，约有27万字，印一个节本，使那些不可能阅读全书的人也能够接触这个问题。                  （转载“学习”杂志1956年1月号）
