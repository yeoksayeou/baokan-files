　　A Salute to the Women of New China
    Eugénie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation

    In the spring of 1955, I visited China, and this unforgettable trip made me realize that your great country is engaged in intense construction everywhere. I will never forget the heroic people of such a great nation. Your country has already achieved many hard-won victories. Although there are still many material difficulties waiting to be overcome, no difficulty can stop you from moving forward.
    China is a great agricultural country, and it will soon become a great industrial power. The work of eliminating floods will also be smoother and smoother. I was particularly impressed and deeply moved by the men and women who stubbornly conquered the fierce Yangtze River. I believe that soon the disastrous power of the rivers will become a source of endless industrial power.
    I wish the women of China greater achievements in all aspects. I have personally seen how hard they work to improve the living and working conditions of their families and children. They have changed a lot since the liberation of the great motherland! Chinese women have strongly supported the war of liberation in the past, and the past life of slavery is gone forever.
    I salute the mothers, housewives, female workers, and female farmers who, despite their busy work, still do not forget to plant flowers and plants in their small courtyards. I salute your female athletes, your talented female cultural workers and female artists!
    I salute your leaders, and I admire their foresight and their noble qualities.
    Long live New China!

　　向新中国的妇女们致敬
    国际民主妇女联合会主席　欧仁妮·戈登
    1955年春天，我曾在中国访问，这次难忘的旅行使我认识到，你们伟大的国家到处在紧张地建设着。我永远不会忘记这样一个伟大国家的英勇的人民。你们的国家已经取得许多来之不易的胜利。现在虽然还有许多物质上的困难还在等待着克服，但任何困难决不能阻止你们前进。
    中国是个伟大的农业国家，不久它就将成为一个伟大的工业国。消除水灾的工作也会愈来愈顺利。我对那些顽强地战胜凶猛的长江的男男女女特别获有印象，并深深地为之感动。相信不久江河的灾害性的力量就会变成无穷的工业动力的泉源。
    我祝望中国妇女在各方面取得更大的成就。我亲眼看到她们如何努力改善她们的家庭和子女的生活和工作条件。她们自从伟大的祖国解放以来已经发生了许多变化！中国妇女过去大力地支持过解放战争，以往的奴隶生活今日是一去不复返了。
    我向母亲们、主妇们、女工们、女农民们致敬，她们工作虽然很紧张，但仍然不忘记在小小的庭院里栽上花草。我向你们的女运动员们，向你们才华澎湃的女文化工作者和女艺术家们致敬！
    我向你们的领导者致敬，我对她们的高瞻远见、她们的高贵品质十分钦佩。
    新中国万岁！
