People's Publishing Houses in Liaoning, Sichuan, Xinjiang and Other Places
Actively Expand the Publication of Popular Rural Reading Materials

In order to meet the needs of the broad masses of farmers and rural basic-level cadres for popular reading materials, People's Publishing Houses in Liaoning, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Shanghai and other places are actively taking measures to expand the publication of popular rural reading materials.

The Liaoning People's Publishing House plans to publish about 10 million copies of popular rural reading materials this year, about three times more than in 1955. In the past, Sichuan Province relied on supplies from other places for its literacy textbooks. This year, the Sichuan People's Publishing House plans to publish 6 million literacy textbooks. In addition to continuing to publish popular rural reading materials in Uyghur, Han, Xibe, Kazakh, Mongolian and other ethnic minority languages, the Xinjiang People's Publishing House also plans to increase the publication of popular books in the Kyrgyz language this year. The Hubei People's Publishing House and the Shaanxi People's Publishing House will both publish a large number of supplementary materials related to rural literacy this year.

People's Publishing Houses in various places are also preparing to expand their subject selection plans and manuscript solicitation scope accordingly this year. The number of types of popular rural reading materials that the People's Publishing Houses in Hubei, Liaoning, Xinjiang and other places plan to publish this year will be one to two times larger than in 1955. The Shanghai People's Publishing House published only a few types of popular rural reading materials in 1955, but plans to increase this to 60 types this year. The People's Publishing Houses in Liaoning, Sichuan and other places are preparing to expand the scope of manuscript solicitation to the county level this year. In addition to vigorously organizing manuscripts, the Liaoning People's Publishing House and the Hubei People's Publishing House are also preparing to strengthen the editing of popular rural reading materials this year.

The Liaoning People's Publishing House and the Hubei People's Publishing House recently sent staff to rural areas to understand the distribution of popular reading materials and the farmers' requirements for publishing houses. The People's Publishing Houses in Sichuan, Liaoning, Hubei, Shaanxi, Xinjiang and other places are also preparing to strengthen contacts with bookstores, post offices and other related distribution departments in order to deliver popular reading materials to farmers quickly.
