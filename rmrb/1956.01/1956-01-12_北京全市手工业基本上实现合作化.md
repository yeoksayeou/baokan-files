    Beijing Basically Achieves Full Cooperative Transformation of Handicraft Industry

    (Our Dispatch) Following the full implementation of joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce in Beijing on the 10th, over 30,000 handicraft workers in Beijing joined various forms of handicraft production cooperatives on the 11th. As of now, the cooperative transformation of the handicraft industry has been basically realized throughout the city.

    Beijing has more than 32,000 handicraft households, employing over 100,000 people. By the end of last year, the city had 414 handicraft cooperatives with more than 36,000 members; in addition, more than 11,000 people had joined elementary mutual aid and cooperation organizations. After more than six months of rectification work focused on criticizing capitalist management ideology, the development of these cooperatives has become increasingly consolidated, laying the foundation for future cooperative development. When the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of party cadres in the city last month, it demanded that more than 80% of the city's handicraft workers be organized this year.

    After the New Year, with the rapid development of agricultural cooperation and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in the urban area, the enthusiasm of handicraft workers to take the road of cooperation has become increasingly high. In recent days, the offices of the district offices of the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation and the district Handicraft Laborers' Associations have been crowded with handicraft workers applying to join the cooperatives. On the afternoon of the 8th, in four hours, more than 300 households and 1,900 handicraft workers in the weaving, towel, and ribbon industries in Chongwen District applied to join the cooperative. By the 10th, ten industries such as sheet metal and metal products in Xidan District and 90% of the handicraft workers in Dongdan District had applied to join the cooperative.

    In the past few years, Beijing's handicraft cooperatives have adopted the method of organizing members by having activists take the lead in connecting, individual application, and cooperative review and approval. Recently, in view of the high morale of the masses, the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation has begun to organize more than 20 specialized joint cooperatives by industry, led by each specialized joint cooperative.

    On the afternoon of the 11th, handicraft workers throughout the city held a city-wide handicraft cooperative celebration meeting in 18 locations including the Beijing Gymnasium. At the meeting, the district party secretaries and district heads, on behalf of the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation, approved the applicants to join the cooperative. Jia Tingsan, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and others attended the meeting to congratulate them, and encouraged the handicraft workers to strengthen unity, strive to improve production management, improve technology, and produce more and better handicrafts for the people after joining the cooperative.

    北京全市手工业基本上实现合作化
    本报讯  继10日北京市资本主义工商业全部实行公私合营以后，11日北京市又有三万多手工业者参加了各种不同形式的手工业生产合作社。至此，全市手工业已基本上实现合作化。
    北京市共有手工业户数32，000多家，从业人员十万多人。到去年年底，全市已有手工业合作社414个，社员36，000多人；此外还有11，000多人加入了初级互助合作组织，在经过半年多以来对以批判资本主义经营思想为中心的整顿工作以后，这些合作社的发展日趋巩固，并给今后合作化的发展打下了基础。上月中共北京市委召开全市党员干部会议的时候，要求今年内把全市80％以上的手工业者都组织起来。
    新年过后，随着市区农业合作化和资本主义工商业改造的飞速发展，手工业者要求走合作化道路的热情也愈益高涨。连日以来，北京市手工业生产合作社联合总社各区办事处和各区手工业劳动者协会的办公室里挤满了申请入社的手工业者。在8日下午的四个钟头内，崇文区的织布、毛巾、绦带三个行业的三百多户、1，900多手工业者便都申请参加了合作社。到10日止，西单区的黑白铁、金属品等十个行业和东单区90％的手工业者都已申请入社。
    过去几年，北京市手工业合作社在发展社员的时候都是采用积极分子带头串连、个别申请、合作社审查批准的办法来进行的。近日以来，鉴于群众情绪的高涨，北京市手工业合作社联合总社已开始按行业组织了20多个专业联社，由各个专业联社来领导进行工作。
    11日下午，全市手工业者分别在北京体育馆等18个地方，举行全市手工业者合作化庆祝大会。会上，各区区委书记和区长代表北京市手工业生产合作社联合总社批准申请者入社。北京市副市长贾庭三等到会祝贺，并勉励手工业者在参加合作社以后，加强团结，努力改进生产管理，提高技术，为人民生产出更多更好的手工业品。
