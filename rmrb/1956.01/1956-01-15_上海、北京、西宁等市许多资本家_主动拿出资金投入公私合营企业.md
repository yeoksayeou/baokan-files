Many capitalists in Shanghai, Beijing, Xining and other cities voluntarily invested funds or assets into joint state-private enterprises before and after the enterprises became joint state-private.

In Shanghai, after Ji Muqing and Ji Zhenyuan, capitalists of the Baida Cotton Weaving Factory, exchanged 420 taels of ancestral gold and invested it in the joint state-private enterprise as capital, Hua Hongtao, manager of Jianxin Trading Co., Ltd., Gui Zhengrong, capitalist of Hua Da Zheng Ji Import and Export Firm, Ma Shubai, capitalist of Yingfeng Hua Hang Co., Ltd., and others wrote to Shanghai Mayor Chen Yi, expressing their willingness to increase investment with off-book materials or private savings. Hua Hongtao, capitalist of Jianxin Trading Company, decided to exchange the US$3,000 he had set aside before liberation for his children's tuition and invest it in the enterprise (after liberation, his children have all obtained work and study opportunities). In addition, he and several friends who had previously planned to open a chemical factory invested 20,000 yuan of accumulated funds in the Shanghai Investment Company. Gui Zhengrong, capitalist of Hua Da Zheng Ji Import and Export Firm, also decided to invest 100 taels of gold in the joint state-private enterprise. The capitalists of Tianyi Department Store not only transferred all enterprise advances to capital, but also took out an additional 300 yuan of savings to invest in the enterprise.

According to statistics on the investment of 67 capitalist households in Beijing, off-book funds invested in enterprises amounted to more than 76,700 yuan, in addition to many valuables and factory buildings. The hotel industry alone had 12 capitalist households investing more than 320 rooms and more than 14,000 yuan in funds. In the traditional Chinese medicine industry, 24 capitalists from 14 pharmacies took out 254 rooms, off-book savings, and more than 800 jin of precious medicinal materials that had been preserved for many years or even generations to invest in enterprises. Le Xiaoxian, manager of Yongrentang Traditional Chinese Medicine Store, held seven family meetings to persuade his wife to invest more than 50 off-book pharmaceutical factory buildings in the enterprise.

Zhang Jifu, manager of Qingtai West Department Store in Xining City, Qinghai Province, took out 20 taels of gold that had been stored for many years as an investment in the joint state-private enterprise. Liao Yuanzhen (female), a capitalist in the stationery industry, invested 2,000 yuan in the joint state-private enterprise. The 38 small businesses in the pork industry have also voluntarily reported increasing store funds, and the funds they have voluntarily reported increasing have now reached more than 4,400 yuan.

    上海市在百达棉织厂资本家季慕卿、季震元把家传黄金420两兑换后，投入公私合营企业作为资金的同时，建新贸易股份有限公司经理华洪涛、华大正记进出口行资本家桂正荣、盈丰华行有限公司资本家马叔白等人，都写信给上海市市长陈毅，表示要以账外物资或私人积蓄增加投资。建新贸易公司资本家华洪涛决定把在解放前留下来准备给儿女做学费用的3，000元美钞兑换后投入企业（解放以后，他的儿女都已经获得了工作和学习的机会）。此外，他还和以前准备开设化工工厂的几个朋友，将积累的资金20，000元投入上海市投资公司。华大正记进出口行资本家桂正荣也决定拿出100两黄金投入公私合营企业。天易百货店的资本家不但把全部企业垫款转作资本，并且还另外拿出300多元积蓄投入企业。
    北京市据67户资本家投资的统计，投入企业的账外资金有76，700多元，另外还有很多贵重商品和厂房等。仅旅店业就有12户资本家投入了320多间房屋和14，000多元资金。国药业有14家药店的24个资本家，把房屋254间、账外存款以及保存多年甚至几代的珍贵药材800多斤，都拿出来投入企业。永仁堂国药店经理乐孝先曾开过7次家庭会议，说服妻子把账外的50多间制药厂房投入企业。
    青海省西宁市庆泰西百货商店经理张吉甫，把存藏多年的20两黄金拿出来作为公私合营企业的投资。文具业资本家廖元贞（女）把2，000元资金投入公私合营企业。猪肉业的38户小商也纷纷自报增加商店资金，目前他们自报增加的资金已经达到4，400多元。  （据新华社讯）
