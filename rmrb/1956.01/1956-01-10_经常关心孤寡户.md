    Regularly Care for the Elderly and Childless
    In Shitou Village, Aofeng Township, Minhou County, Fujian Province, there is a poor old widow named Jia Ge Sao. She heard that the township was going to organize poor and lower-middle peasants into agricultural cooperatives first, and she was both happy and worried. She was happy because joining the cooperative would mean she had support in life; she was worried because she had no labor power and feared the cooperative wouldn't accept her. Just as she was thinking about this, Ye Guoliang, a cadre from the cooperative, came to encourage her to join. Jia Ge Sao was overjoyed and immediately signed up. It turned out that when the township Party branch was formulating the overall cooperative plan, it had already included elderly, widowed, and impoverished households in the plan, and even arranged what kind of work they would do after joining the cooperative. For example, the cooperative assigned Jia Ge Sao to feed the cattle. This way, her life had support, and the cooperative could free up a laborer for other work.
    Rural Party organizations and cooperatives should proactively and systematically absorb elderly, weak, widowed, and childless households into the cooperative. This will not only solve the living difficulties of these households, but also help the cooperative develop production. The superiority of the cooperative's collective management and common prosperity is precisely manifested here. Any act of discrimination and exclusion against the elderly, weak, widowed, and childless households is incompatible with the Party's cooperativization policy.

    经常关心孤寡户
    福建省闽侯县鳌峰乡石头村有个贫困的老寡妇甲哥嫂，她听说乡里要先把贫农和下中农组织到农业合作社里去，心里又是喜又是愁。她喜的是加入了合作社生活就有依靠了；愁的是她没有劳动力，怕合作社不吸收。她正在想这件事的时候，合作社的干部叶国良来发动她入社。甲哥嫂真是说不出的高兴，立刻报名入了社。原来，这个乡的党支部在订合作化全面规划的时候，就把孤寡贫困户规划进去了，连他们入社以后干些什么活都作了安排。如社里分配甲哥嫂喂牛。这样，她的生活有依靠了，社里也可以腾出一个劳动力干别的活。
    农村党组织和合作社都应该主动地有计划地吸收老弱孤寡户入社。这样，既可以解决孤寡户的生活困难，又可以帮助合作社发展生产。合作社集体经营共同富裕的优越性也恰恰表现在这里。一切歧视和排挤老弱孤寡户的作法是和党的合作化政策不相容的。
