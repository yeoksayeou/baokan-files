Gansu Province Youth Eliminate 230,000 Sparrows in One Week

The youth of more than ten counties and cities in Gansu Province, including Gaotai, Yongning, and Yinchuan, eliminated a total of more than 230,000 sparrows in the week before the New Year.

More than 80,000 young people and teenagers from these counties and cities were mobilized, organizing more than 2,400 sparrow-killing shock teams and shock groups. The 23 sparrow-killing shock teams organized by more than 1,800 young people and teenagers in Xinmin Township, Yinchuan City, captured more than 20,000 sparrows in two nights. Ye Rufang, a female member of the Communist Youth League in Zaoyuan Township, Zhongning County, led two young women to capture 75 sparrows in one night.

During the sparrow-elimination campaign, the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers organizations in many government offices and schools in Gansu Province also held league day and team day activities to catch sparrows. Many places launched sparrow-elimination competitions between townships and townships, and between shock teams, generally proposing to launch a sparrow-elimination campaign during the sparrow breeding season this spring.
