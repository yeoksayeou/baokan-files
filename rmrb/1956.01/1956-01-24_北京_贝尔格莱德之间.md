Between Beijing and Belgrade
	Wang Yi Wang Xi
	
I.
	One of the leaders of Yugoslavia, Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council, Comrade Djurkovic, received the Chinese journalists' delegation in his reception room. He said to us cordially: "You have come, very good. This is not just a polite remark. For twenty years, the people of Yugoslavia have been watching the struggle of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party and have been very happy..." We could comprehend and accept the warmth, understanding, and friendship contained in this short welcome everywhere we visited in Yugoslavia.
	In Ljubljana, despite the already tight schedule, the attentive hosts still took us to the lakeside hotel on Lake Bled, dozens of kilometers away, at dusk to spend the night so that we could visit this famous scenic spot the next morning. They said: If you come to Slovenia and do not visit Lake Bled, we will feel very sorry. In Macedonia, people led us to visit a glass factory that was under construction and only partially in operation. When we passed the construction site of the largest Mavrovo Hydropower Station in the Republic, it was late, and the roads on the snowy highway were very slippery. But the people who were building the hydropower station enthusiastically accompanied us for a section of the road crowded with trucks, advancing only 10 kilometers in an hour and a half. The director of the hydropower station and the person accompanying us got out of the car countless times to push the car stuck in the mud... just so that we could visit the underground water pipes and tunnel project. Comrade Director said very sincerely: Even if you only watch for a few tens of minutes, we will be happy.
	The meeting with the workers of the "May First" Machine Manufacturing Factory in Zagreb was unforgettable. When we finished the tour and walked out of the factory building, two of our comrades were walking behind. The workers in the workshop discovered that we were a Chinese delegation. In an instant, dozens of workers left the machines that were running and surrounded the two comrades. People shook their hands tightly and started talking all at once. In the factory office, we held group discussions. Every room was so crowded that there was no room for another chair. The conversation with the comrades of the factory workers' committee was a bit difficult to continue. The people being interviewed didn't seem to have the heart to answer our questions. In a short period of time, they drew two hearts on paper connected by a line, and then wrote on the paper: "Great Mao Zedong, great..." They had endless words in their hearts.
	In Rijeka, after we visited the chairman of the executive committee of the district people's council, we were walking down the stairs when we met a middle-aged man who looked like an ordinary staff member. He looked up and stared at us in surprise, and suddenly, as if realizing something, asked: "China?" When he saw us nod, he was extremely happy and repeatedly said loudly several times: "China, Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai...", while opening his arms as if embracing something. Before we could answer, he rushed to say: "Chiang Kai-shek, Taiwan..." At the same time, he put his hands together to form a small circle. This stranger, whom we had never met before, cleverly conveyed his friendship to the Chinese people through his gestures and emotions.

II.
	Although China and Yugoslavia are so far apart, from the west coast of the Pacific Ocean to the Adriatic Sea, which is more than thousands of miles away, the people of the two countries have the same glorious experience in their struggle for national independence and freedom.
	When the Chinese People's Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was traversing snow-capped mountains and grasslands, carrying out the arduous Long March of 25,000 li, the people of all ethnic groups in Yugoslavia were gasping under the terror of the dictatorial rule of the Regent, who was colluding with fascist forces. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Yugoslav people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, were carrying out an underground struggle to break free from the heavy chains. What encouragement the news that the Chinese Red Army had victoriously reached the anti-Japanese front gave to the Yugoslav revolutionaries imprisoned behind bars! Even today, we have heard countless times from young workers speaking in respectful voices about the 25,000-li Long March. At a banquet in Sarajevo, the host said in his speech: "The Chinese people are very healthy people. When we were doing underground work, the Party often used your spirit of enduring hardship in the 25,000-li Long March to educate us: Since the Chinese people can overcome difficulties and achieve victory, why can't we? It was not until we achieved the victory of the revolution that we fully understood the full significance of the events that took place in China."
	The Chinese people's long struggle against the Japanese imperialist aggression was even more closely connected with the struggle of the people of all ethnic groups in Yugoslavia against the German and Italian fascist occupiers. Many people told us that Comrade Mao Zedong's writings at the time, especially "Strategic Problems of Guerrilla War Against Japan," were required reading for the commanders and fighters of the Yugoslav People's Guerrilla. We also told them that the news of the Yugoslav People's Guerrilla's struggle also often appeared side by side with the news of our people's victory in the newspapers of the Chinese Liberated Areas. Under difficult material conditions, Chinese journalists in the enemy's rear often spent one or two days finding the location of a heroic town in order to enable readers to see a map of Yugoslavia, and when there were no conditions to make zinc plates, they used woodcut maps instead. One of the gifts we gave to the Yugoslav journalists made them extremely happy. This was a reproduction photo of a newspaper clipping. The photo was taken of the news of the victorious advance of the Yugoslav anti-fascist army published in the CCP Central Committee's organ newspaper, Liberation Daily, published in Yan'an at that time. When we handed this photo to Comrade Stoiljkovic, chairman of the Yugoslav Journalists Association, the people present stared at it for a long time with excitement! This was the expression of people feeling the joy of being understood and cared for.
	In Yugoslavia, the small handful of traitors of China, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, is despised by everyone with the same notoriety as Mihailović—the traitor of Yugoslavia during the anti-fascist war. Based on their own struggle experience, people firmly believe that the Chinese people will liberate Taiwan and will obtain legitimate status in the United Nations. The Croatian Republic newspaper "Liberation Daily," published in Sarajevo, published more than 50 articles supporting the Chinese people's march to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's rule and the struggle to liberate Taiwan. The humorous satirical bi-monthly named "Čičak" - meaning "Thorn" - frequently featured cartoons satirizing Chiang Kai-shek: people painted Chiang Kai-shek as a begging puppy, lying at the feet of his fat master.
	Perhaps the understanding and friendship of the Yugoslav friends towards the Chinese people can be summarized by the words of Comrade Vlahović, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Federal People's Assembly. When he received us, he said: "The Chinese revolution is a victory of world significance following the Soviet October Revolution. We have been closely concerned about what is happening on Chinese soil. The experience of the Chinese revolution belongs not only to the Chinese people but also to all countries in the world. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries, people who have visited China have been moved by the simple revolutionary enthusiasm of your country's people. It is remarkable that the Chinese Communist Party has cultivated such qualities in the Chinese people."

III.
	Since the official establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Yugoslavia, the development of friendly relations between the people of the two countries has surpassed the progress of time. During our stay in Yugoslavia, a total of four delegations visited and traveled there. Newspapers in various places have increased their coverage of China. Yugoslav friends told us that it seems like it is a "China Month" in Belgrade now. Friends in the press told us that Yugoslav readers are extremely interested in the various tasks that China is carrying out and the various aspects of the Chinese people's lives.
	When we left our motherland, Chairman Mao's work "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" had only been published for a few days. And when we set foot on Yugoslav soil, this work was already being discussed among Yugoslav friends. In Novi Sad, the central city of the agricultural region of Vojvodina, we visited the director of the state rural administration, the vice-chairman of the cooperative union, and experts such as the director of the agricultural department and the director of the agricultural research institute. After answering our questions, people surrounded us with a series of questions. The reporter from the local newspaper who was present immediately squeezed forward from the other end of the conference table to take careful notes. Regarding the situation in rural China, their interest was concentrated on: how to build water conservancy projects; how cooperative land is shared and how dividends are distributed; how the government helps rural development...
	When we were in the factory, people made various requests to Chinese enterprise employees: exchange visiting delegations, exchange experts, exchange experiences, exchange products... The workers always urged us: bring the best respect to the Chinese worker brothers.
	The welcome that the Chinese Art Troupe received in Yugoslavia was very touching. The hotels in the cities we stayed in all posted posters announcing their performances. However, the audience attracted by the advertisements had to sigh at the difficulty of grabbing tickets. In a theater in Sarajevo that can only accommodate 600 audience members, as many as 1,200 audience members were squeezed into one performance, and the corridors and entrances were so crowded that the windows and doors of the theater were broken. People who were tensely building the Mavrovo Hydropower Station on a construction site dozens of kilometers away from Skopje drove for several hours on snowy and muddy roads to Skopje specifically to see the performance. People told us that if he gave up such an opportunity, he would regret it for the rest of his life.
	The Yugoslav people are so eager to understand us. Belgrade Radio has adapted the story of "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," the only film ever shown in Yugoslavia, into a Serbian drama and broadcast it many times on the radio program. Many people inquired about how to buy foreign language translations of Chinese literary works so that they could translate them to Yugoslav readers; a Yugoslav sinologist told us that he had translated the poems of Li Bai and Du Fu from French translations into Serbian...

	In mid-November, we took the Budapest-Belgrade international train, which took nearly 10 hours. We changed carriages twice near the border before arriving in Belgrade. And 25 days later, when we bid farewell to Belgrade, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia had signed a civil aviation agreement for direct flights. On a morning as pleasant as the October Indian summer in Beijing, we boarded a plane from Belgrade directly to Moscow. At 10 pm Moscow time that night, we were overlooking the red star of the Kremlin in the sky again. The distance between Belgrade-Moscow-Beijing is shortening, constantly shortening...

    北京—贝尔格莱德之间
    王揖　汪溪
    一
    南斯拉夫国家领导人员之一，联邦执行委员会副主席乔拉柯维奇同志在他的会客室里接见中国新闻工作者代表团。他亲切地对我们说：“你们来了，很好。这不只是一句礼节话。从二十年前起，南斯拉夫人民就注视着中国人民和中国共产党的斗争，而感到十分高兴……。”这个简短的欢迎词所蕴蓄着的亲热、理解和友情，我们在南斯拉夫访问时到处都可以领会和接受到。
    在卢布尔雅那，尽管日程已经很拥挤了，但殷勤的主人还是在黄昏时刻带领我们出发到相隔数十公里外的不莱得湖滨湖旅馆去过一夜，以便我们能在次晨游览一下这个有名的风景区。他们说：你们来到了斯洛文尼亚而没有游览不莱得湖，我们会感到很抱歉的。在马其顿，人们领我们参观过正在修建而只局部开工生产的玻璃工厂；当我们路过共和国最大的马夫罗沃水电站工地的时候，天色已晚，积雪的公路上道路很滑。但正在修建水电站的人们，热心地陪我们行驶了一段被来往运输卡车拥挤着的路程，一个半小时才前进了10公里。水电站的厂长和伴我们同行的人，无数次下车来推动陷在泥泞里的车子……只为了可以让我们参观一下地下水管和隧道工程。厂长同志十分真诚地说：那怕你们只看几十分钟，我们也会感到高兴的。
    在萨格勒布同“五一”机器制造厂的职工们的相见是很难忘怀的。在参观完了走出厂房的时候，我们有两个同志走在后面。车间里的工人发现了我们是中国的代表团。一刹那间有几十个工人都离开了正在转动的机器，把这两个同志团团地包围起来。人们紧紧地握着他们的手，七嘴八舌地插起话来。在这个工厂的办公室里，我们进行了分组的座谈。每一个屋子都拥挤得再也添不了一张椅子。同工厂工人委员会的同志们的谈话，有点继续不下去了。被访问的人好像没有心思回答我们的问题似的，在短促的时间里，他们一会儿在纸上画两个心，用一条线穿连着，一会儿又在纸上写：“伟大的毛泽东，伟大的……”他们的心里有说不尽的千言万语。
    在里冶卡城我们访问了区人民议会执委会主席后，正在下楼梯的当儿，迎面走上来一个仿佛是普通工作人员模样的中年人。他抬起头来惊诧地望望我们，忽然，若有所悟地问道：“中国？”他见我们点了头，高兴极了，连连地大声说了好几遍：“中国，毛泽东，朱德，周恩来……”，一面张开两臂像是在拥抱什么。我们还没来得及答话，他又抢着说下去：“蒋介石，台湾……”同时，两只手合拢来比划成个小圆圈。这位素未晤过面的陌生朋友，借着他的手势和感情，巧妙地向中国人概括地传达了他的友情。
    二
    中国和南斯拉夫虽然相隔这么遥远，但是，从太平洋的西岸到相隔岂止万里的亚得里亚海边，两国人民为争取祖国独立自由的斗争却有同样光荣的经历。
    当中国人民的工农红军正在翻雪山、过草地，进行着艰苦卓绝的二万五千里长征的时候，南斯拉夫各族人民正喘息在和法西斯势力勾结着的摄政王恐怖的独裁统治之下。南斯拉夫人民优秀的儿女，在共产党领导下，为挣脱沉重的锁链进行着地下斗争。中国红军胜利地到达了抗日前线的消息，曾经使被关在铁窗里的南斯拉夫革命者得到怎样的鼓舞！直到今天，我们还无数次地从年轻的工人嘴里，听到他们用尊敬的声音谈到二万五千里长征。在萨拉热窝的一次晚宴上，主人致词说：“中国人民是非常健康的人。我们在作地下工作的时候，党就经常拿你们进行二万五千里长征的刻苦精神教育我们：中国人民既然能够克服困难取得胜利，我们为什么不能。直到我们取得了革命的胜利，我们才充分体会了在中国发生的事变的全部意义。”
    中国人民抗击日本帝国主义侵略的长年斗争，更是同南斯拉夫各族人民反德、意法西斯占领者的斗争，脉脉相通的。许多人都告诉我们：毛泽东同志当时的著作，特别是“抗日游击战争的战略问题”，曾经是南斯拉夫人民游击队的指战员必读的文献。我们也告诉他们说：南斯拉夫人民游击队的斗争消息，也经常在中国解放区的报纸上同我国人民的胜利消息并排出现。在艰难的物质条件下，在敌人后方的中国新闻工作者为了使读者能看到一张南斯拉夫地图，常要花费一两天时间，寻找一个英勇的城镇的方位，而在没有条件制锌版时，就用木刻地图代替。有一件我们送给南斯拉夫新闻工作者的礼品，使他们感到了极大的欢喜。这是一张剪报的复制照片。照片拍摄了当时在延安出版的中共中央机关报——解放日报上刊载过的南斯拉夫反法西斯军队胜利进军的消息，当我们把这张照片亲手交给南斯拉夫记者协会主席斯托依利科维奇同志的时候，在场的人们用着怎样兴奋的眼光对它久久注视着！这是人们感到了被人理解、被人关切的快慰时的表情。
    在南斯拉夫，中国的一小撮卖国贼蒋介石集团，是和米哈依洛维奇——南斯拉夫在反法西斯战争期间的卖国贼的臭名一样，人人唾弃的。人们根据自己的斗争经验，坚信中国人民一定要解放台湾，一定要取得在联合国的合法权位。在萨拉热窝出版的克罗地亚共和国报纸“解放报”，曾发表过50几篇文章，支持中国人民推翻蒋介石统治的进军和解放台湾的斗争。以“契卡克”——意思是“刺”——命名的幽默讽刺半月刊上经常出现讽刺蒋介石的漫画：人们把蒋介石画作一条乞怜的小狗，趴在肥胖的主子的脚边。
    也许南斯拉夫朋友们对中国人民的理解和友情，可以用联邦国民议会外交委员会主席弗拉霍维奇同志的话概括的。他在接见我们时说：“中国革命是继苏联十月革命之后，有世界意义的胜利，我们一直密切关怀着在中国土地上发生的事情。中国革命的经验不仅属于中国人民，也属于世界各国。我们两国建交以后，访问过中国的人，都被你们国家人民朴素的革命热情所感动。中国共产党培养了中国人民这样的素质，是件了不起的事。”
    三
    中南两国正式建立邦交以来，两国人民之间的友谊关系的发展超越了时间的推进。我们停留在南斯拉夫期间，前后共有四个代表团在那里访问旅行。各地的报纸，都增加了对中国的报道。南斯拉夫的朋友告诉我们：现在在贝尔格莱德，好像是过着“中国月”。新闻界的朋友告诉我们说，南斯拉夫读者对于中国正在进行的各项工作，中国人民各方面的生活，都感到莫大的兴趣。
    在我们离开祖国的时候，毛主席的“关于农业合作化问题”的著作才发表几天。而当我们踏上了南斯拉夫国土以后，这个著作已在南斯拉夫的朋友们间谈论着了。在农业区伏伊伏丁那州的中心城市诺维萨得城，我们访问了州的农村管理局长、合作社联合会副主席，以及农学系主任、农学研究所所长等专家们。在回答了我们的问题之后，人们以一连串的问题包围了我们。在座的地方报纸的记者，马上也从会议桌的那一端挤向前来仔细地做起笔记来。关于中国农村的情况，他们的兴趣集中在：怎样兴修水利；合作社土地怎样入股，怎样分红；政府如何帮助农村的发展……。
    我们在工厂时，人们向中国企业职工提出了各种要求：互派访问代表，交换专家，交流经验，互通产品……。工人同志们总是叮嘱我们：把最好的敬意带给中国工人兄弟。
    中国艺术团在南斯拉夫受到的欢迎是很感人的。我们住过的城市旅馆，都张贴着预告他们演出的海报。可是，被广告吸引着的观众，却不得不叹抢购戏票的困难。在萨拉热窝一个只能容600个观众的戏院里，在一次演出中，竟挤了1，200个观众，走廊和道路口已是水泄不通，以致戏院的门窗玻璃都打碎了。离斯科比数十公里的工地上，正在紧张地修建马夫罗沃水电站的人们，在积雪泥泞的公路上行驶几小时，专诚到斯科比去看演出。人们告诉我们，如果他放弃了这样的机会，他将终生感到遗憾的。
    南斯拉夫人民是那样热望着了解我们。贝尔格莱德的广播电台曾把在南斯拉夫上演过的唯一影片“梁山伯和祝英台”的故事，改编成塞尔维亚语的话剧，在广播节目里放送过许多次。许多人打听怎样可以买到中国文学作品的外文译本，以便他们能转译给南斯拉夫的读者；一位南斯拉夫的汉学家告诉我们，他曾把李白、杜甫的诗从法文译本译成了塞尔维亚文……。
    ×　×　×    
    11月中旬，我们是乘布达佩斯—贝尔格莱德国际列车，行驶了近10小时，在接近边境时换过两次车厢，才到达贝尔格莱德的。而在25天以后，我们向贝尔格莱德告别的时候，苏联和南斯拉夫已签订了直接通航的民航协定。在像北京的10月小阳春一样宜人的早晨，我们搭上了从贝尔格莱德直通莫斯科的飞机，当天晚上莫斯科时间10点钟，我们又在天空上俯瞰着克里姆林宫的红星了。贝尔格莱德—莫斯科—北京的距离在缩短着，不断地缩短着……。
