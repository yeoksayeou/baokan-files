Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, January 8th: Some political and business figures in Thailand have voiced their opinions in the latest issue of the bi-monthly publication "Economy," advocating that Thailand should change its foreign policy and establish friendly and direct trade relations with China.

    MP Nai Phenjati Chutinan pointed out that the Thai authorities' foreign policy of willingly aligning themselves unilaterally with the United States is an inappropriate policy. The year-by-year increase in military expenditure has already placed the Thai economy in a difficult situation. He said that peaceful coexistence can certainly be achieved because people all over the world need peace, and the Thai people are also "100% peace-loving."

    Nai Phenjati Chutinan also pointed out that the "embargo" against China has severely affected Thailand, which previously had trade relations with China. This is because Thailand's important exports, tin and rubber, can only be sold to the United States and are subject to price reductions by the United States. He believes that in order to solve Thailand's economic difficulties, the only urgent need for Thailand is to expand direct trade with China, and hopes to obtain assistance from China through this.

    Thai Deputy Prime Minister Nai Warakan Bancha also believes that "continuing to implement the embargo policy will, in some respects, cause losses to the Thai economy."

    Nai Phra Lue Jira Pong, spokesperson for the Thai Liberal Democratic Party and Member of Parliament, accused the Thai authorities of blindly following the policies of the United States. He said that the Thai government should immediately stop preparing for war and abolish the "embargo," and at the same time implement a neutral policy.

    Nai Ari Tan's domain Chak Jung, a member of the Thai Liberal Democratic Party, said when talking about trade with China that direct trade with China should not be a problem. If there is a problem, it is only because Thailand is under the control of the United States.

    泰国一些名流主张
    “建立中泰友好和贸易关系”
    据新华社8日讯　曼谷消息：泰国一些政界和商界人士在最近一期“经济”半月刊上发表谈话，主张泰国应该改变对外政策，同中国建立友好和直接贸易关系。
    议员乃彭泰·触的努七指出，泰国当局甘愿片面同美国联系的对外政策是一种不适宜的政策。军事开支一年年增加，这已经使泰国经济情况处于困难境地。他说，和平共处一定可以实现，因为全世界人民都需要和平，泰国人民也是“百分之百地爱好和平”。
    乃彭泰·触的努七还指出，对中国的“禁运”，已经使得原来和中国有着贸易关系的泰国遭受到严重的影响。因为泰国重要出口品锡和橡胶只能卖给美国，并且被美国压价。他认为，为了解决泰国经济困难，泰国唯一急需做的就是扩展对中国的直接贸易，并且希望可以借此得到中国的帮助。
    泰国副总理乃哇拉干·班差也认为“继续实行禁运政策，在某些方面将使泰国的经济遭到损失。”
    泰国自由民主党发言人、议员乃帕绿·紫拉蓬指责泰国当局盲目追随美国的政策。他说，泰国政府应该立即停止备战和取销“禁运”，同时实行中立政策。
    泰国自由民主党议员乃阿里·丹的域差军在谈到同中国贸易的问题时说，同中国直接贸易，其实不该成为问题，如果有问题，那只是由于泰国处在美国的控制之下而已。
