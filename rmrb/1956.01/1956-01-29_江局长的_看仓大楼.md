To the Editor:

　　On a hillside in Huatan, Chaling County, Hunan Province, a beautiful new two-story building has been constructed. Some people who don't know the details mistakenly believe it is a sanatorium. Some people who know the details call it the "Warehouse Viewing Building."

　　It turns out that in October 1955, the Chaling County Grain Bureau received 46,000 yuan in basic construction funds from the special district to build two warehouses. According to instructions from higher authorities, 10% of this amount could be used to build offices and dormitories for warehouse staff. At that time, Jiang Qingzheng, the director of the Grain Bureau, disliked the house he lived in, so he decided to use the 4,600 yuan extracted, along with 2,100 yuan allocated by the County Finance Section to the Grain Bureau to improve housing for general staff, to build a two-story building as offices and housing for cadres above the section chief level of the Grain Bureau. During the construction process, old bricks were also used to exchange the new bricks for the warehouse foundation to build the building.

　　The director and section chiefs were satisfied with living in the new building, but the housing problem for general staff was not solved. As for the granaries? One was delayed and could not be completed, and the other, although completed, was of poor quality. Director Jiang, who lived in the "Warehouse Viewing Building," never asked about this situation.

### 江局长的“看仓大楼”

    江局长的“看仓大楼”编辑同志：
    在湖南茶陵县一化坛的山坡上，新建了一栋漂亮的二层的楼房。有些不知道底细的人把它误认为疗养所。有些知道底细的人却把它叫做“看仓大楼”。
    原来，1955年10月，茶陵县粮食局收到专区拨下来修建两栋仓库的基本建设资金46，000元，按照上级指示，可以在这笔款内抽出10％用来建造看仓人员的办公室和宿舍。当时粮食局局长江清正嫌他所住的房屋不好，就决定把抽出来的4，600元同县财政科拨给粮食局添修一般工作人员住房的2，100元拿来修建一栋二层楼房，作为粮食局股长以上干部的办公室和住房。在修建的过程中，还用旧砖把仓库打脚基的新砖换来盖楼房。
    局长和股长们住上了新楼倒是心满意足了，可是一般工作人员的宿舍问题却得不到解决。至于粮仓呢？有一栋迟迟不能建成，有一栋虽然建成了，但是质量却不好。这个情况，住进了“看仓大楼”的江局长就从不过问了。
