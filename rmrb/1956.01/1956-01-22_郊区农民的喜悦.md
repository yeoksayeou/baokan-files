    The 380,000 farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai have entered socialist society together with the people of Shanghai. In the January 21st parade in Shanghai celebrating the victory of socialist transformation, the ranks of suburban farmers aroused great interest among the people. They drove tractors and automobiles, carried various crops, and carried indicator boards showing future agricultural production goals. The girls were all dressed up beautifully, marching happily in the mighty procession. Just by looking at this team, you can see how drastic the changes in the suburbs of Shanghai have been in recent years.

    After the suburban rural areas of Shanghai victoriously completed the semi-socialist cooperativization at the end of last year, the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers was unprecedentedly high. In particular, after the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a rural work conference to put forward a comprehensive plan for the next seven years of work in the suburban rural areas, the farmers were even more excited. All townships and cooperatives enthusiastically launched discussions, and "running advanced cooperatives" became the central topic of discussion among suburban farmers. In the fields, in the markets, in the kitchen, in the civil school classrooms, people were talking about advanced cooperatives, about tractors, and about power irrigation networks. At every mass meeting where people signed up to join advanced cooperatives, they could not restrain their enthusiasm. On the evening of the 16th, at a meeting in Gaoqiao Town attended by more than 1,700 representatives, the signing of 1,000 households to join the advanced cooperative began, and people flocked to sign first. Later, because it was too crowded, at everyone's suggestion, a show of hands was used, and some people even raised both hands. At a mass meeting jointly held by the Xinqiao Cooperative and the Chenguang Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangxin Township, everyone also scrambled to sign first, and the first to grab the signature were 79-year-old Grandma Cao Meiying and 66-year-old Grandma Li Xianlang.

    Amid the suburban farmers' eagerness to run advanced cooperatives, the Shanghai Suburban Agricultural Producers Cooperative Representatives Conference was held on the 18th. At this meeting, the socialist enthusiasm of 380,000 farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai was concentratedly expressed. When the chairman of the conference, Zhang Yaoxiang, director of the Suburban Farmers Association, announced, "Say what you have been wanting to say day and night!" many representatives rushed forward and lined up in a long queue, all of them asking the government to approve their running of advanced cooperatives, while many others below the stage asked to speak. Chairman Zhang Yaoxiang said, "There is no time for everyone to speak, your wishes are all written in the applications, please submit your applications." At this time, the applications from more than 1,100 cooperatives, contained in huge red envelopes, were sent to the rostrum, covering the steps on both sides of the rostrum. When Dong Quan, director of the Shanghai Municipal Agriculture Bureau, announced on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee the approval of these cooperatives to be converted into advanced cooperatives, the sound of gongs and drums reverberated throughout the venue. After the meeting, these more than 2,000 farmer representatives, amid the welcome of Shanghai workers and people from all walks of life, held a joyous parade in the city.

    郊区农民的喜悦
    李东铭
    上海郊区38万农民已经和上海人民一起进入了社会主义社会。在21日上海庆祝社会主义改造胜利的游行队伍里，郊区农民的队伍引起了人们莫大的兴趣。他们开着拖拉机和汽车，挑着各种农作物，扛着今后发展农业生产的指标牌。女孩子们都打扮得漂漂亮亮，在浩浩荡荡的队伍中，兴高采烈地前进。只要看看这个队伍，就可以发现上海郊区农民这些年来的变化有多么剧烈。
    上海郊区农村在去年年底胜利地完成了半社会主义的合作化以后，广大农民的社会主义热情空前高涨，特别是中共上海市委召开的农村工作会议对郊区农村今后七年工作提出全面规划以后，农民的心情更加激动了。各乡各社都热烈地展开了讨论，“办高级社”成了郊区农民谈论的中心。在田头，在市集，在炉灶间，在民校教室，到处都谈着高级社，谈着拖拉机，谈着电力灌溉网。在每一个报名参加高级社的群众集会上，他们都抑制不住自己热烈的情绪。16日晚上，在高桥镇，1，700多个代表参加的集会上，1，000户参加高级社的签名开始了，人们蜂拥而上，都嚷着要先签名。后来，挤得没有办法，经过大家的提议，就采取举手的方法，有的人还举起了双手。江心乡新桥合作社和晨光农业合作社联合举行的群众集会上，大家也是争着要签第一名，抢得最先的是79岁的老妈妈曹美英和66岁的老妈妈李仙郎。
    就在郊区农民们这种迫切要求办高级社的热情下，18日，举行了上海市郊区农业生产合作社代表会议。在这个会议上，上海郊区38万农民的社会主义热情集中地表现了出来，当会议主席、郊区农民协会主任张耀祥宣布：“把你们日夜想讲的话说出来吧！”许多代表又一拥而上，排成了很长的队伍，他们都要求政府批准他们办高级社，而台下还有许多人要求上台发言。主席张耀祥说：“一个个发言来不及，你们的心愿都写在申请书上了，你们把申请书递出来吧。”这时，1，100多个社的装在巨大的红色封套里的申请书，送上了主席台，把主席台两旁的阶台都铺满了。当上海市农业局局长董铨代表上海市人民委员会宣布批准这些社转为高级社的时候，全场锣鼓声震天地响起来了。会后，这两千多农民代表，在上海工人和各阶层人民的欢迎中，兴高采烈地在市内举行了游行庆祝。
