　　Reactions of Various Countries' Public Opinion to the French Election Results

    Newspapers of Poland and Other Countries
    Newspapers in Poland, Romania, and other countries have attached importance to the victory of the French Communist Party in the general election.
    A correspondent for the Polish "People's Tribune" in Paris pointed out in an article commenting on the French general election: The French Communist Party remains the largest party in France. Furthermore, it is the parliamentary group with the most members in the French parliament. This is an important new factor in the French political situation, and this factor cannot but have a beneficial impact on the international situation.
    A correspondent for the Romanian "Spark" in Paris pointed out in an article entitled "France Has Voted for a Policy of Social Progress, Democracy, and Peace": Due to the significant victory of the Communist Party, French workers and the broad masses of the people have once again clearly demonstrated that foreign pressure cannot intimidate them, and they are even more determined to demand fundamental changes in domestic and foreign policies.

    French Newspapers
    Paris newspaper commentators generally believe when commenting on the results of the National Assembly elections that this election brought victory to left-wing parties, especially the French Communist Party. They also pointed out that the voting situation clearly showed the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of voters with the policies implemented in France in recent years.
    An Agence France-Presse commentator pointed out: "The parties that have been in power at various times since 1951 have lost seats without exception."
    The comments of the right-wing newspapers reflected the situation of the ruling group, who were panicked by the will of the voters to clearly express their desire to change the political course of France. Some newspapers even believed that since the government group parties could not obtain a sufficient majority in the National Assembly, they should quickly dissolve the assembly and first set a more reliable election system for the bourgeois parties.
    "Liberation" pointed out that in the election process, the French people showed an indomitable will to establish a government that pursues a left-wing policy. The newspaper believes that there are conditions in the new National Assembly to meet this demand of the people. It said that only a Popular Front government can realize the country's deep wishes.

    British Newspapers
    Many British newspapers generally reflected the disappointment of the ruling group with the results of the French elections, believing that the attempt to generate a stable force to form a government to implement current policies had failed. A Reuters reporter said that the voting clearly reflected the depth of the French people's "dissatisfaction with the 'old order'" and that "more and more people are voting for the Communist Party." The "Daily Express" pointed out that the French voted for the Communist Party because they opposed arming West Germany and feared that arming West Germany "would bring war in the near future."

    West German Officials and Newspapers
    A West German government spokesperson said on the 4th that Adenauer was worried that the results of the French elections would make it difficult to organize a government in Paris.
    A press release from the West German Social Democratic Party said, "The Western world has ample reason to be apprehensive about the results of the French elections."
    West Germany's "Die Welt" in Hamburg said that this was bad New Year news for the Western allies, exceeding the allies' worst fears.

    American Newspapers
    American newspapers openly threatened France when commenting on the results of the French elections.
    "New York Herald Tribune" observer Tolbert pointed out that "the results of the French elections, combined with the events in French North Africa not long ago, fundamentally shake the European defense structure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization," and the newspaper also believes that this result "undoubtedly forces the West to generally reconsider its strategy toward Europe." When implying a plan to exert crude pressure on France, Tolbert declared that "countermeasures" should be taken, "especially by strengthening the armed forces of the Bonn government."
    "New York Times" reporter Callender, in a dispatch from Paris, quoted officials from neighboring countries as saying that "if France's internal problems are not resolved," then it "may not be able to expect to be regularly included among the three major Western powers in the future."

    North African Liberation Committee Issues Statement on French Election Results
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 5th (TASS) - United Press reported that the North African Liberation Committee issued a statement on the 4th, signed by the committee's permanent representative to the United States, Buhafa. The statement said that the results of the French elections opened a path to a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue. The committee firmly demanded that freedom be granted to Messali Hadj, the leader of the Algerian national movement who was expelled from Algeria by the French authorities and is now forced to live in France, and also raised demands regarding the cessation of police suppression and the cancellation of the Algerian state of emergency order.

　　各国舆论对法国选举结果的反应
    波罗等国报纸
    波兰和罗马尼亚等国的报纸都重视法国共产党在大选中获得的胜利。
    波兰“人民论坛报”驻巴黎记者在评论法国大选的文章里指出：法国共产党仍然是法国的第一大党。此外，它又是法国议会中议员人数最多的党团。这是法国政局中一个重要的新因素，这个因素对国际局势也不能不发生有利的影响。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”驻巴黎记者在题目叫作“法国已经投票赞成社会进步、民主和和平的政策”的一篇文章里指出：由于共产党的重大的胜利，法国工人和广大人民群众再度清楚地证明外国的压力不能吓住他们，他们更加坚决地要求根本改变对内和对外政策。
    法国报纸
    巴黎报界评论员在评论国民议会选举结果时普遍认为：这次选举给左翼党派，首先是法国共产党带来了胜利。他们并且指出，投票情况明显地显示了广大选民群众对法国近几年来实行的政策的不满。
    法新社评论员指出：“从1951年以来在各个时期执过政的政党无例外地都丧失了席位。”
    右派报纸的评论反映了统治集团的情况，他们由于选民明白表示出来的主张改变法国政治路线的意志而惊惶失措。有些报纸甚至认为，既然政府集团各党派在国民议会得不到足够的多数，就应该赶快解散这个议会，而事先定出一个对资产阶级政党更为可靠的选举制度。
    “解放报”指出，在选举过程中，法国人民表现出要建立一个奉行左的政策的政府的不屈不挠的意志。这家报纸认为，在新的国民议会中有了满足人民的这一要求的条件。它说，只有人民阵线的政府能够实现国家的深刻愿望。
    英国报纸
    英国许多报纸普遍反映了统治集团对法国选举结果的失望情绪，认为想产生稳定力量来组成执行现行政策的政府的企图已告失败。路透社记者说，这次投票明显地反映出法国人民“对‘旧秩序’不满意的深度”，“有越来越多的人投共产党的票”。“每日快报”指出，法国人投共产党的票，因为他们反对武装西德，并且害怕武装西德“在最近将来要带来战争”。
    西德官方和报纸
    西德政府发言人4日说，阿登纳担心法国选举的结果将使巴黎组织政府的工作发生困难。
    西德社会民主党的新闻公报里说，“西方世界有充分理由因为法国选举的结果而惶惶不安。”
    西德汉堡的“世界报”说，对西方盟国说来这是一个坏的新年消息，它超过了盟国最坏的担忧。
    美国报纸
    美国报纸在评论法国选举的结果的时候，公然对法国发出威胁。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”观察员托尔贝特指出，“法国大选的结果同不久以前法属北非的事件结合在一起，使北大西洋公约组织这个欧洲防御机构从根本动摇”，报纸并且认为，这种结果“无疑使得西方不得不普遍重新考虑对欧洲的战略”。托尔贝特暗示对法国施加粗暴的压力的计划时，声言要采取“对策”、“特别是采取加强波恩政府的武装力量的办法”。
    “纽约时报”记者卡伦德在从巴黎发出的消息中引用邻国官方人士的话说，“如果法国的内政问题得不到解决”，那末它“未必能指望它将来能经常列入西方”三大国之中。
    北非解放委员会就法国选举结果发表声明
    新华社据塔斯社纽约5日讯　合众社报道，北非解放委员会4日发表了由委员会常驻美国代表布哈法签署的一项声明。声明说，法国的选举结果为和平解决阿尔及利亚问题开辟了一条道路。委员会坚决要求给予被法国当局从阿尔及利亚驱逐出境、现在被迫住在法国的阿尔及利亚民族运动领导人麦萨利·哈吉以自由，还提出了关于停止警察镇压和取消阿尔及利亚紧急状态命令的要求。
