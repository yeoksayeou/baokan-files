Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 23rd. Workers constructing Anshan Iron and Steel (Ansteel) are striving to complete more than one-third of the planned construction and installation work in the first quarter. From the Ansteel plant area to the mountains a hundred miles away, more than 40 projects have begun intense construction. In order to install the steel structure of the rebuilt No. 9 blast furnace two to three months ahead of schedule, before the end of March, the installation workers decided to work in shifts day and night from the start of the installation. Workers building the Dagushan Ore Dressing Plant are striving to complete three times more construction tasks than originally planned. Workers building the second water source guarantee to complete more than 80% more construction than originally planned for the first quarter.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company has decided to complete all seven major Ansteel projects, one to five months ahead of schedule, within this year. The early commissioning of these projects will play a significant role in ensuring that Ansteel completes its Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 23rd. Last year, Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company completed a total of 113 new and reconstruction projects for the country. The amount of work completed increased by more than 30% compared to 1954.

Last year, the main projects completed by this iron and steel industry construction team included four new large open-hearth furnaces, one automated iron-smelting furnace, five mining and ore-dressing projects, four coke ovens, two soaking pits, one recovery workshop, two refractory material workshops, and a giant high-pressure steam boiler, etc.

Thirteen of the projects completed last year were completed ahead of schedule and put into production. According to statistics from one iron-smelting furnace, one open-hearth furnace, one coke oven, and two soaking pit projects that were put into production ahead of schedule, the value of the products produced for the country can be used to build an automated iron-smelting furnace or two coke ovens.

    鞍钢争取超额完成第一季度施工任务
    鞍山钢铁建设公司去年建成113项新建改建工程
    据新华社鞍山23日电　建设鞍钢的职工争取在第一季度完成比原计划多三分之一以上的建筑安装工作量。从鞍钢的厂区直到百里以外的山岭，现在已经有40多项工程开始了紧张建设。为了争取比原计划提前两三个月在3月底以前把改建的九号高炉的炉体钢结构安装起来，安装工人决定一开始安装就昼夜轮班施工。建设大孤山选矿厂的职工正在争取完成比原来增加三倍多的建设任务。建设第二水源地的工人，保证要超过原计划80％多完成第一季度的施工任务。
    鞍山钢铁建设公司已经决定把鞍钢的七个主要工程，分别提前一个月到五个月在今年内全部建成。这些工程的提前投入生产，对于保证鞍钢提前完成五年计划将起很大作用。
    新华社鞍山23日电　鞍山钢铁建设公司去年共为国家建成了113项新建和改建工程。完成的工作量比1954年增大了30％多。
    去年，这支钢铁工业建设队伍完成的主要工程有四座新式的大型平炉、一座自动化炼铁炉、五个采矿和选矿工程、四座炼焦炉、两座均热炉、一个回收车间、两个耐火材料车间和一座巨型的高压蒸汽锅炉等。
    去年完成的工程中有13项是提前完工投入生产的。仅据提前投入生产的一座炼铁炉、一座平炉、一座炼焦炉和两座均热炉工程统计，多为国家生产的产品价值就可以建设一座自动化炼铁炉或两座炼焦炉。
