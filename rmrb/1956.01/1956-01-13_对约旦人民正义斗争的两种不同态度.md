    Egypt Supports Jordanian Government Statement
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 11th via TASS: According to Egyptian newspapers, the Samir al-Rifai government's statement that Jordan will not participate in foreign conventions has been warmly welcomed by the Jordanian people.
    Egyptian newspapers believe that this statement is a major victory for the Jordanian people, who are firmly opposed to dragging Jordan into the aggressive Baghdad Pact. The newspapers wrote that the heroic struggle of the small Jordanian people against foreign treaties has forced the imperialists to retreat.
    Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser has telegraphed Rifai to congratulate the new government on its achievements in its activities. Nasser highly praised the Jordanian government's statement opposing participation in military alliances. Nasser said that this statement "has made a deep impression on the people of Arab countries."

    Syria, Egypt, and Other Countries Suggest Providing Assistance
    Xinhua News Agency, January 12th: Damascus News: Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia jointly presented a memorandum to Jordan on January 11, expressing their willingness to provide economic assistance to Jordan. It is reported that the purpose of this assistance is to replace the "aid" provided to Jordan by Britain, in order to alleviate the pressure exerted by Britain on Jordan to force it to join the Baghdad Pact.
    In the memorandum, the three Arab countries stated that they hoped to negotiate with the Jordanian government to discuss how these three countries could provide assistance and financial aid to the Jordanian government. The communiqué stated that the three countries were prepared to provide Jordan with assistance in order to "replace British aid to the Arab Legion and the National Guard" and to enable Jordan to resist "possible Israeli aggression."
    The communiqué also said that the three countries suggested that the heads of the four Arab countries hold a meeting to discuss this issue.

    Britain Exerts New Pressure on Jordan
    Xinhua News Agency, London, January 10th via TASS: On January 10, the British War Office announced that a new batch of airborne troops would be transferred to Cyprus to reinforce the island.
    As can be seen from the comments of British newspapers, the deployment of British troops to Cyprus is primarily to exert pressure on Jordan.
    The "News Chronicle" believes that "in the event of a new situation, troops stationed in Cyprus can be airlifted to support the Arab Legion in order to maintain order."

    The United States Admits to Firing on Demonstrators
    Xinhua News Agency, January 11th via TASS Washington, January 10th: U.S. State Department spokesman White said at a press conference on January 9, when asked whether the news that U.S. Marines fired on demonstrators in Jordan on January 8 was true, that they "fired, but not at those participating in disrupting order."
    Another State Department spokesman said that the State Department had received information that Jordanian demonstrators tried to break into the residence of the U.S. Consul General on January 8, but were "repelled by Marine guards and staff."

    对约旦人民正义斗争的两种不同态度
    埃及支持约旦政府声明
    新华社据塔斯社开罗11日讯：据埃及报纸报道，萨米尔·里法伊政府关于约旦不参加外国公约的声明受到约旦人民的热烈欢迎。
    埃及报纸认为，这个声明是坚决反对把约旦拉入侵略性巴格达条约的约旦人民的重大胜利。报纸写道，小小的约旦的人民反对外国条约的英勇斗争已经迫使帝国主义者退却。
    埃及总理纳赛尔已经打电报给里法伊祝贺新政府在它的活动中取得成就。纳赛尔对约旦政府表示反对参加军事联盟的声明给予极高的评价。纳赛尔说，这个声明“在阿拉伯国家人民中产生了深刻的印象”。
    叙埃等国建议提供援助
    据新华社12日讯  大马士革消息：叙利亚、埃及和沙特阿拉伯1月11日联合向约旦提出备忘录，表示它们愿意向约旦提供经济援助。据悉，这项援助的目的是为了代替英国给约旦的“援助”，以便减轻英国为了迫使约旦参加巴格达条约而对约旦施加的压力。
    这三个阿拉伯国家在备忘录中表示，希望同约旦政府进行谈判，讨论这三个国家能够以什么方式给予约旦政府以协助和财政援助的问题。公报说，这三个国家准备给予约旦以援助，以便“代替英国对阿拉伯军团和国民警卫队的援助”，并且使约旦足以抵抗“以色列可能发动的侵略”。
    公报又说，三个国家建议四个阿拉伯国家的首脑举行会议以讨论这个问题。
    英国对约旦施加新压力
    新华社据塔斯社伦敦10日讯  1月10日，英国陆军部宣布将一批新的空运部队调往塞浦路斯岛增援。
    从英国报纸的评论中可以看出，英国军队的调往塞浦路斯首先是为了对约旦施加压力。
    “新闻纪事报”认为，“一旦发生新的情况，驻扎在塞浦路斯的军队就可以用飞机调去支援阿拉伯军团，以便维持秩序”。
    美国供认曾向示威者开火
    新华社11日讯  塔斯社华盛顿10日讯：美国国务院发言人怀特1月9日在记者招待会上回答关于美国海军陆战队士兵1月8日在约旦向示威群众开火的消息是否确实的问题时说，他们“开了火，但是不是对参加捣乱秩序的人开的”。
    国务院的另外一个发言人说，国务院得到的消息说，约旦示威者在1月8日试图闯入美国总领事的住所，但是被“海军陆战队卫兵和职员击退了”。
