The comprehensive socialist transformation in medium-sized cities and small towns throughout Jiangsu Province has set off a magnificent wave. From the historical city of Nanjing to Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Xuzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, Nantong, to the emerging industrial city of Xin Hailian and the province's important towns of Changshu, Taizhou, Qingjiang, and other 12 province-administered cities, capitalist industry and commerce have all been transformed into joint state-private enterprises. Handicraft industry and agriculture in these cities have also basically achieved cooperativization.

In the province's thousands of small towns, industry and commerce, handicraftsmen, and small vendors have followed the big cities in realizing joint state-private ownership and cooperativization. According to statistics from 11 province-administered cities, 800,000 people directly participated in the victory parades celebrating socialist transformation.

In these exciting days filled with the sound of gongs and drums and the waving of red flags, the masses in every city were like a sea of joy. Some capitalists participated in costume performances in the parades; some capitalists' family members wore wedding dresses from decades ago and performed the yangko dance; some pushed their children in carts to participate in the parade. Workers and peasants were even more enthusiastic. While participating in the parades and celebrating the good news, they also persisted in production. Many people completed two days' work in one day and proposed guarantees to complete five years' worth of work in four years. This emotion is real, valuable, not at all forced, and not at all artificial. It precisely demonstrates the masses' yearning for socialism. It is not an exaggeration to describe today's socialist transformation movement in the cities with the words "the trend of the times, the will of the people" and "the fruit is ripe, and the water flows into the channel."

Chen Guansheng and Chen Busheng, brothers who were capitalists in the silk weaving industry in Suzhou, jointly ran the Yanling Silk Factory. To compete for power and profit, they quarreled and slammed the table, eventually building a wall to divide the Yanling Silk Factory into two factories, one called Yanling Guanji Silk Factory and the other called Yanling Zhengji Silk Factory. The two brothers both stated that they would "not visit each other in life and not attend each other's funerals." The two brothers had not interacted with each other for more than ten years. The private ownership of the old society turned close brothers into enemies. However, after the Municipal People's Committee approved the joint operation of the silk weaving industry, Guanji and Zhengji merged into one company again, and the two brothers thanked the socialist system for reuniting them. They both took their families to participate in the celebration parade.

Zhang Fengming, the vice chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce in Wuxi City, was until recently the manager of the privately owned Rixin Silk and Cloth Store. After the city's entire industry and commerce became joint state-private, he has now been appointed by the Municipal People's Committee as the deputy manager of the Wuxi City Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company. In recent days, he has been busy with the joint state-private operation of industry and commerce throughout the city. Only now can he truly control his own destiny. The Rixin Silk and Cloth Store he founded had squeezed out many competitors in 1930. In the same year, a capitalist from Shanghai came to Wuxi and opened a "Yunshang Silk and Cloth Store," meaning "dark clouds covering the sun." When "Yunshang" opened, Zhang Fengming sent a Guan Gong statue, because Guan Gong's name is Yunchang, implying "Guan controls Yunshang." Afterwards, the two companies competed for territory, fighting to the death. As a result, when the Japanese devils arrived, they burned and killed, and both "Rixin" and "Yunshang" perished together. Zhang Fengming realized that in the old society, no matter how much effort he put in, he still could not control his own destiny. His two daughters, who were studying at Suzhou Normal School, kept writing to him, asking him to accept transformation and control his own destiny. Therefore, in this movement, he said excitedly: "The country has arranged a bright future for me, and I have taken control of my own destiny. Looking at my children and thinking about the future, I must work hard and transform myself well."

Due to limited capital, large expenditures, and many unresolved problems in production, supply, and sales relationships, some capitalists, small business owners, small vendors, and handicraftsmen in the vast towns and cities are embracing the transformation. After joint operation, they will be incorporated into the national plan, and problems that could not be solved in the past will be reasonably resolved. Therefore, they compare the Party's policy of socialist transformation to "sending charcoal in the snow" and express their heartfelt support. The owner of Fang Zhenzhong Iron Shop in Sanyang Town, Haimen County, only cared about quantity and not quality in the past. Farmers were unwilling to buy his goods, business was sluggish, capital was lost, and he was in debt. After being approved by the government to participate in the iron and woodworking production cooperative this time, his monthly salary is enough to maintain his life and have a surplus. After the grocery and general merchandise industries in this town were organized, the turnover in eight months increased five to ten times compared with the same period in the past. Therefore, all the cooperative and sales group members in this town have proposed the slogan of striving to take the first train to socialism, and have all applied to be converted into advanced cooperatives and joint state-private enterprises.

In the upsurge, the emotions of the employees of private enterprises are indescribable. The employees of Changzhou Wantai Tea and Food Shop compared their feelings upon hearing the news of joint state-private operation to: "The heart is like a bird flying into the vast sky, and the fish jumping into the clear spring." Many employees have decorated their windows to welcome a more pleasant tomorrow. Many employees have also helped business owners to understand their thoughts and handed over off-the-books funds. Many employees have also made guarantees in production and work, made achievements, and contributed everything to socialism.

In these joyous days, the labor enthusiasm of workers and handicraftsmen is even higher. While doing a good job in production, they also do a good job in joint state-private operation. On the 17th, all the workers of Nanjing Fucheng Machine Factory wanted to participate in the parade, but a batch of parts urgently needed to be processed for a state-owned factory. Therefore, the young shock team members went to work an hour and a half early, completing the task two hours ahead of schedule, and the quality met the standards, ensuring that everyone could participate in the parade. Nanjing iron and bamboo handicraftsmen have also successfully trial-produced six new products: artificial rain machines, sprayers, transplanting machines, rice threshers, grass cutters, and chain-type windmills. They have decided to immediately start producing new agricultural tools to support agricultural cooperativization.

In Nanjing City, there is a magnificent Workers' Cultural Palace, which is currently receiving capitalists, handicraftsmen, and peasants separately, and will be open to them in the future. This is a very meaningful thing, and it marks that the relationship between people is undergoing tremendous changes.

    江苏全省城镇在欢腾
    甄为民　史月娥
    江苏省各中等城市和小城镇的全面社会主义改造已掀起了波澜壮阔的巨浪。从历史名城南京，到镇江、扬州、徐州、无锡、苏州、常州、南通，到新兴的工业城市新海连和省内的重要城镇常熟、泰州、清江等12个省属市的资本主义工商业已经全部公私合营。这些城市的手工业和农业也已经基本实现合作化。
    全省千多个小城镇中的工商业、手工业者、小商贩也随着大城市实现公私合营和合作化。据11个省属市的统计，直接参加庆祝社会主义改造胜利游行的有80万人。
    在整日锣鼓喧天红旗招展的使人激动的日子里，每个城市的群众队伍都像欢乐的海洋一样。有的资本家参加了游行中的化装表演；有的资本家的家属穿着几十年前的嫁衣，扭起秧歌，有的用小车推着自己的孩子参加游行。工人和农民更为热情，他们一面参加游行、报喜，一面还要坚持生产，很多人在这些天里一天完成了两天的工作量，并且提出4年完成5年工作量的保证。这种情绪是真实的，可贵的，一点也不勉强，一点也不做作，正是表现了群众对社会主义的向往。用“大势所趋，人心所向”“瓜熟蒂落，水到渠成”，这几个字眼来形容今天城市的社会主义改造运动，一点也不算夸张。
    苏州市丝织业的资本家陈冠生和陈补生两兄弟共同经营的延龄绸厂，为了争夺权利，闹得拍桌摔板凳，结果砌了一堵墙壁把延龄绸厂分成两个厂，一个叫延龄冠记绸厂，一个叫延龄正记绸厂。两兄弟都表示今后“生不往来，死不吊孝”。就这样兄弟俩十多年不相往来。旧社会的私有制使亲兄弟变成了活冤家。但是，这次市人民委员会批准丝织业合营后，冠记和正记又合并成一家，兄弟俩都感谢社会主义制度又使他们重归于好。他们都带着家属参加了庆祝游行。
    无锡市的工商联副主任委员张凤鸣，不久以前还是私营日新绸布店经理，在全市全行业公私合营后，现在已经被市人民委员会任命为无锡市花纱布公司副经理了，连日来他正为全市工商业的公私合营而忙碌着。因为只有现在，他才能真正掌握自己的命运。他所创设的日新绸布店，在1930年曾排挤了不少同业。同年，上海一个资本家来到无锡开了一爿“云裳绸布店”，含意是“乌云盖日”。当“云裳”开幕时，张凤鸣送去一幅关公像，因关公名云长，含意是“关云裳”。之后两家就互相争夺阵地，拚得你死我活，结果日本鬼子一到，一阵烧杀，“日新”和“云裳”都同归于尽。张凤鸣这才体会到在旧社会任凭怎样费尽心机，还是不能掌握自己的命运。他的两个在苏州师范读书的女儿，不断写信给他，要他接受改造，掌握自己的命运。所以在这次运动中他兴奋地说：“国家替我安排了远大前途，我自己才掌握了命运，看看孩子，想想将来，我一定要努力工作，好好改造自己”。
    广大城镇中的一些资本家、小业主、小商贩、手工业者，由于资金少、开支大，产供销关系上有许多问题得不到解决。合营后，他们将被纳入国家计划轨道，过去不能解决的问题也会得到合理解决。因此，他们把党的社会主义改造的方针比作是“雪中送炭”，表示衷心拥护。海门县三阳镇方振忠铁铺的老板，过去只顾数量不顾质量，农民都不愿买他的东西，生意清淡，资金蚀光，还负了债。这次被政府批准参加铁木业生产社后，每月的薪金足够维持生活而有余。这个镇的杂货、百货行业，组织起来以后，八个月的营业额，比过去同期增加了五倍到十倍。因此，这个镇的全部合作、经销小组组员，这几天他们提出了争取乘第一列车到社会主义的口号，已全部申请转为高级社和公私合营。
    在高潮中，私营企业职工的情绪是难以形容的。常州万泰茶食号的职工把听到公私合营消息的心情譬喻为：“心坎里像小鸟飞到了广阔的天空，鱼儿跳进了清泉”。许多职工布置好了橱窗，迎接更愉快的明天。许多职工还帮助企业主搞通思想，交出了账外资金。许多职工更在生产上和工作上提出保证，做出成绩，为社会主义贡献一切力量。
    在欢腾的日子里，职工和手工业者的劳动热情更加高涨。他们一面搞好生产，一面搞好公私合营。17日，南京福成机器厂的工人个个都要参加游行，可是国营厂有一批零件急需要加工。于是，青年突击队员们就提早一小时半上班，使任务提前二小时完成，质量都合乎标准，保证了大家能参加游行。南京铁竹业手工业者也试制成功了人功雨机、喷雾器、移苗机、打稻机、铡草机、链子式风车等六种新产品，他们决定马上动手生产新农具，支援农业合作化。
    在南京市有一座富丽堂皇的工人文化宫，这几天正分别接待资本家、手工业者和农民，今后也将向他们开放。这是一件很有意义的事情，它标志着人和人之间的关系正在经历着巨大的变化。
