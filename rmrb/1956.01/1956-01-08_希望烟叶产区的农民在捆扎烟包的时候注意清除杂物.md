To the Editor:

　　Recently, the tobacco leaves supplied to our factory by the Shanghai Branch of the China Tobacco Monopoly Company have frequently contained various debris such as stone chips, soil clumps, coal particles, broken glass, chicken feathers, broom bristles, vines, corn, soybeans, peanut skins, hair, and rat droppings. For example, one batch of Qingzhou Mao Da tobacco, totaling 33,350 kilograms, contained as much as 2,259 kilograms of mud, accounting for 6.77% of the total weight. In another batch of Fufeng sun-cured leaves, vines alone accounted for 2% of the total weight.

　　The excessive amount of debris in the tobacco leaves not only requires a significant amount of extra labor for sorting but also makes some production tools prone to damage. For example, the attrition rate of our factory's tobacco-cutting knives has recently more than doubled compared to the past. More seriously, the quality of cigarette products has also been affected as a result.

　　In order to ensure product quality and reduce production costs, we hope that the Party and government leading organs in tobacco-producing areas will educate farmers to be mindful of preventing debris from mixing in when bundling tobacco leaves. Individual farmers who intentionally put debris into the tobacco leaves should be criticized and stopped. At the same time, the China Tobacco Monopoly Company and the flue-curing factories that process tobacco leaves should also strengthen the inspection and cleaning of tobacco leaves.

　　希望烟叶产区的农民在捆扎烟包的时候注意清除杂物
　　编辑同志：
    最近中国专卖公司上海分公司供应我厂的烟叶中，经常混有石片、土块、煤粒、碎玻璃、鸡毛、扫帚毛、藤条、玉米、黄豆、花生皮、头发和老鼠粪等各种杂物。例如有一批青州毛大烟共33，350公斤，其中竟有泥土2，259公斤，占总重量的6.77％；另一批扶风晒叶中，仅藤条一项就占总重量的2％。
    由于烟叶中杂物太多，不但需要多花不少人工来挑拣，而且也使部分生产工具易于损坏。例如我厂的切烟丝刀，最近损耗率就比过去提高了一倍多。更严重的是，卷烟产品的质量也因此受到了影响。
    为了保证产品质量、降低生产成本，我们希望烟叶产区的党政领导机关教育农民们在捆扎烟包的时候注意不要让杂物混入；对个别有意在烟叶中放进杂物的农民，则应该提出批评，加以制止。同时，中国专卖公司和加工烟叶的烤烟厂，也应该加强对烟叶的检验和清理工作。
