Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th. Japanese plenipotentiary Matsumoto Shunichi, who is in charge of negotiations with the Soviet Union for the normalization of relations between the two countries, said in an article published in the "Tokyo Shimbun" on the 6th that if the state of war between Japan and the Soviet Union continues, "this will hinder the improvement of Japan's international status." However, "Unfortunately at present, there is no firm policy (on the Japanese side), and all I can do is persevere."
    Matsumoto Shunichi's remarks were caused by disagreements within the Japanese government on the issue of Japanese-Soviet negotiations. Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama advocates "early conclusion of a peace treaty" with the Soviet Union, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, headed by Mamoru Shigemitsu, adopts a stubborn and slow attitude.
    Matsumoto Shunichi left Tokyo for London on the 7th to resume negotiations with the Soviet representative, which had been temporarily suspended since September 21 last year.

　　日本谈判代表不满日本政府对苏日谈判的顽固态度
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本同苏联举行两国关系正常化谈判的全权代表松本俊一6日在“东京新闻”发表了一篇谈话说，如果日本和苏联的战争状态继续存在下去，“这将会阻碍日本国际地位的提高和改善”。但是，“目前不幸的是，（日本方面）并没有坚定的政策，而我所能做的只是固执。”
    松本俊一的这个谈话是由于日本政府内部在日苏谈判问题上意见不一致所引起的。日本首相鸠山一郎主张同苏联“早日缔结和约”，但是以重光葵为首的外务省却采取顽固的、慢慢来的态度。
    松本俊一已经在7日离东京前往伦敦，准备同苏联代表恢复从去年9月21日起暂时中断的谈判。
