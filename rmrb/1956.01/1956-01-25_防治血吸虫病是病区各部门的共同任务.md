    Preventing and Controlling Schistosomiasis is the Common Task of All Departments in Disease Areas
    Wang Qingyuan
    To eliminate schistosomiasis, the health department should play the greatest role, and other departments such as agriculture and water conservancy must also actively cooperate. Because the prevalence of schistosomiasis is closely related to natural conditions, agricultural production, and the living habits of farmers, it is impossible to control and eliminate schistosomiasis without the active cooperation of various departments and the adoption of comprehensive measures.
    In the past few years, in some areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent, other departments have cooperated with the health department in doing a lot of prevention work and have achieved some results. However, on the whole, this problem has not been completely solved. In most areas, the prevention and control work is still being done by the health department alone and has not yet received the cooperation of other departments such as agriculture and water conservancy; at the same time, the health department has not actively sought the cooperation of other departments, and other departments do not know how to cooperate. Therefore, the prevention and control work in these areas appears to be weak, and the masses have not been fully mobilized. Therefore, all departments in areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent must incorporate the parts of schistosomiasis prevention and control work related to their own business into the planning of their departments and actively cooperate with the health department to do a good job in schistosomiasis prevention and control.
    The main measures to prevent schistosomiasis are to eliminate snails, manage feces, and protect water sources. These measures involve the specific business of agriculture, water conservancy, and other departments. One of the methods of fecal management is to concentrate and cover manure tanks in cooperatives or production teams, and store urine and feces in a certain proportion (store for seven days in winter and three days in summer) until the ammonia decomposed by urea kills the eggs before using it to fertilize the fields. Centralized storage of feces can kill eggs, prevent schistosomiasis and other gastrointestinal infectious diseases, and prevent a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer from volatilizing, preserving the fertilizer value. Therefore, this method of accumulating fertilizer must be universally promoted in areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent in the future. Southern farmers have the habit of using fertilizer at any time. Centralized storage of feces sometimes affects farmers' timely use of fertilizer, so that fecal management work is not easy to consolidate. In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to find ways to open up new fertilizer sources and give priority to the supply of chemical fertilizers to farmers in areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent to ensure the time required for storing feces. At the same time, livestock such as cattle, sheep, pigs, and dogs can also be infected and transmit schistosomiasis, and the feces of livestock must also be managed. Therefore, the implementation of fecal management measures cannot be achieved by the health department alone, and must be actively cooperated with and vigorously promoted by the agricultural department. In addition, the agricultural department should also cooperate with the health department to carry out some necessary research work. For example, in severely affected areas, focus on pilot projects to change paddy fields to dry land, study the use of high-yield dry crops to replace rice, so as to eliminate snails in the fields; study livestock manure management methods and treatment methods for livestock infected with schistosomiasis, etc.
    When building water conservancy in areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent, it should also be combined with the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. In the low-lying areas of the Yangtze River Basin and lakeside areas, they are flooded every summer when the water rises, and become reed beaches when the water falls in winter, which is very suitable for snails to breed. Therefore, the snail density and positivity rate in the local area are very high. When farmers go to such areas to fish, cut lake grass, and graze cattle, they are infected. In such areas, the best preventive measures to eliminate snails should be combined with water conservancy construction. The renovation project of South Dongting Lake is a typical example. South Dongting Lake was originally greatly affected by the water level of the Yangtze River. Since 1952, sluice gates have been built at the intersection of the Yangtze River and South Dongting Lake, and dikes have been built along the lake, and the reed beaches around the lake have been reclaimed. Not only has the Yangtze River been spared from floods, but also state-owned farms have been established, and the cultivated land area has been expanded. In the area with high snail density that has been reclaimed, it is now almost impossible to find living snails. Wherever there are similar areas, the same method of building water conservancy can achieve the same effect. Therefore, in the future, the water conservancy department must consciously strengthen the water conservancy construction work in areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent, and in the design and construction, the project should also have the effect of preventing and controlling schistosomiasis; at the same time, attention should also be paid to hygiene management issues during construction, strengthen the fecal management of migrant workers, and prevent migrant workers from coming into contact with epidemic water. When necessary to contact the epidemic water, there should be protective equipment, such as wearing double-layer cloth socks, rubber boots, tung oil cloth socks, etc., to avoid infection with schistosomiasis. In the construction of general small-scale water conservancy, snail elimination measures should also be combined, such as dredging irrigation ditches and burying snails in the soil.
    According to the investigation reports in various places, school-age children and young adults account for the majority of schistosomiasis patients. Many children stop developing due to schistosomiasis, and young adults gradually lose their ability to work. The reason why they are infected with schistosomiasis is mainly that they are infected by schistosoma cercariae penetrating their skin when swimming and bathing in the river in summer and catching fish and crabs. Sometimes, acute schistosomiasis infection with severe symptoms and a high mortality rate can occur. Youth League organizations, education departments, school authorities, and Young Pioneers in areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent should earnestly mobilize young people to prevent schistosomiasis, strictly prohibit swimming and bathing in the river, emphasize drinking well water, and publicize the principles of schistosomiasis prevention and control to the masses through them, and actively take the lead in implementing various prevention and control measures.
    Fishermen and boat dwellers defecating into the river is one of the main factors causing the prevalence of schistosomiasis; the percentage of fishermen and boat dwellers infected with schistosomiasis is also the highest. Therefore, organizing fishermen and boat dwellers to manage feces is an important measure. Agricultural departments, fisheries unions, and inland river transportation departments in areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent should actively cooperate with the health department to do a good job in the fecal management of boat dwellers, advocate that people on small boats defecate ashore, install toilets on large boats, and establish manure storage pools and public toilets in places where boats are docked for fishermen and boat dwellers to use, so as to prevent the opportunity for feces to pollute water sources. At the same time, fishermen should also be educated to minimize contact with river water, help fishermen improve production tools, and advocate wearing double-layer cloth socks or tung oil cloth socks when going into the water to prevent schistosomiasis.
    In areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent, the percentage of women infected with schistosomiasis is also very high, mainly because they are infected by washing clothes and rice, picking water chestnuts and lotus roots in the river; at the same time, one of the main factors of fecal contamination of water sources – washing chamber pots in the river every day, is also mostly done by women. Therefore, the democratic women's federations and other mass organizations in the prevalent areas should actively cooperate with the health department to do a good job in fecal management, earnestly educate women to never wash chamber pots and fecal utensils in the river, and always drink well water. When river water must be used, it should be heated to a scalding degree (drinking water must be boiled) or disinfected with bleaching powder before use. At the same time, other preventive measures should also be taken.
    In the comprehensive development of schistosomiasis prevention and control, the cooperation of publicity and publishing agencies is also necessary. For example, compile and publish propaganda paintings, comic strips, songs, slide shows, and popular pamphlets related to schistosomiasis prevention and control, and provide them to schistosomiasis prevalent areas for publicity and education to the masses. The education department should also compile and print supplementary teaching materials and distribute them to schools and night schools in schistosomiasis prevalent areas to increase the subjects of schistosomiasis prevention and control.
    In addition, the public security department in areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent should also actively cooperate with the health department to carry out prevention and control work, conduct health publicity and education, regularly supervise and inspect the implementation of various preventive measures by residents, schools, organs, groups, and other departments, and promptly criticize and commend them, and jointly promote the work of schistosomiasis prevention and control.
    In short, the prevention and control of schistosomiasis is an arduous task, and all departments should actively and proactively cooperate with the health department to do this work well under the unified leadership of party and government organs at all levels. The health department must take the initiative to contact other departments in the work to obtain cooperation, and provide other departments with information on schistosomiasis prevention and control. For the solution of important issues, it should be discussed jointly with other departments. Only in this way can the work of schistosomiasis prevention and control be done well, so that schistosomiasis can be completely eliminated in the end.

    防治血吸虫病是病区各部门的共同任务
    王清源
    消灭血吸虫病，卫生部门应当发挥最大的作用，农业、水利等其他部门也必须积极配合。因为血吸虫病的流行同自然条件、农业生产和农民的生活习惯有着密切的关系，如果没有各个部门的积极配合，采取综合性的措施，是不可能收到控制和消灭血吸虫病的效果的。
    过去几年中，在部分血吸虫病流行的地区，其他部门配合卫生部门做了很多预防工作，也取得一些成绩。但整个说来，这一问题并没有得到完全解决。大部分地区的防治工作仍然是卫生部门在单干，还没有得到农业、水利等其他部门的配合；同时卫生部门也没有主动地取得其他部门的配合，其他部门也不知道应该怎样配合，因此在这些地区的防治工作就显得没有力量，群众没有充分发动起来。因此，在血吸虫病流行地区的各个部门必须把防治血吸虫病工作同自己业务有关的部分纳入本部门业务的规划之内，积极配合卫生部门做好防治血吸虫病的工作。
    预防血吸虫病的主要措施是消灭钉螺、管理粪便和保护水源。这几项措施都涉及到农业、水利等部门的具体业务。粪便管理的办法之一是以合作社或生产队为单位把粪缸集中加荫加盖，并且把尿粪按一定比例混合储存（冬天存七天，夏天存三天），待尿素分解的氨把虫卵杀死后再用来肥田。粪便集中储存，既能杀死虫卵，预防血吸虫病及其他肠胃传染病，又能防止氮肥大量挥发，保存了肥料价值。因此今后在血吸虫病流行地区必须普遍推广这一积肥方法。南方农民有随时用肥的习惯，粪便集中储存，有时影响农民及时用肥，以致粪便管理工作不易巩固。为了解决这一问题，必须设法开辟新的肥源，并且把化学肥料优先供应血吸虫病流行地区的农民，以保证储存粪便所需要的时间。同时，牛、羊、猪、狗等家畜也能感染并且传播血吸虫病，对家畜的粪便也要管理。因此，粪便管理措施的贯彻施行，绝不是卫生部门本身力量所能达到，必须由农业部门积极配合，大力提倡，才能实现。此外，农业部门还应该配合卫生部门进行一些必要的研究工作。如在严重流行地区重点试行改水田为旱地，研究用高产量旱种作物代替水稻，以消灭田中的钉螺；研究家畜粪便管理方法和家畜感染血吸虫病的治疗方法等。
    在血吸虫病流行地区兴修水利的时候，也应当和防治血吸虫病的工作相结合。在长江流域及滨湖地区的低洼地带，每年夏季水涨的时候被水淹没，冬季水落的时候则变为芦滩，极适宜钉螺滋生繁殖。因此当地的钉螺密度及阳性率很高，当农民到这种地区捕鱼、割湖草、放牛的时候就被感染。在这种地区进行灭螺的预防措施，最好和兴修水利的工作相结合。南洞庭湖的整修工程就是一个典型例子。南洞庭湖原来受长江水位影响很大，自1952年开始在长江和南洞庭湖相通处修了水闸及沿湖修了堤坝并且开垦了湖周围的芦滩以后，不但免除了长江水患，建立了国营农场，扩大了耕地面积，而且也消灭了当地的钉螺。在原来钉螺密度很高而被开垦的地区内，现在几乎已经找不到活的钉螺。凡是类似这样的地区，采用相同的方法兴修水利，都能收到同样效果。因此今后水利部门必须有意识地加强血吸虫病流行地区的兴修水利工作，并且在设计和施工中，使工程兼收防治血吸虫病的效果；同时在施工中还应当注意卫生管理问题，加强民工的粪便管理，不使民工跟疫水接触，必要接触的时候，应当有防护装备，如穿双层布袜、胶靴、桐油布袜等，以免感染血吸虫病。在一般小型水利的兴修工作中，也应当结合灭螺措施，如疏浚灌溉沟渠、土埋钉螺等。
    根据各地的调查报告，在血吸虫病患者中，学龄儿童和青壮年患者占多数，有不少儿童由于患了血吸虫病而停止发育，青壮年患者则逐渐失去劳动能力。他们感染血吸虫病的原因主要是夏天下河游泳洗澡及捉鱼摸蟹等被血吸虫尾蚴钻入皮肤得病，有时能发生病状严重、死亡率很高的血吸虫病急性感染。在血吸虫病流行地区的青年团组织、教育部门、学校当局、少先队等应当认真动员青少年预防血吸虫病，严禁下河游泳洗澡，强调饮用井水，并且通过他们向群众宣传防治血吸虫病的道理，积极带头贯彻施行各项防治措施。
    渔民船户大便排入河中是造成血吸虫病流行的主要因素之一；渔民船户感染血吸虫病的百分率也最高，因此组织渔民船户进行粪便管理是一项重要措施。血吸虫病流行地区的农业部门、渔业工会、内河航运部门应当积极配合卫生部门做好船户的粪便管理，提倡小船上的人上岸大便，大船装置马桶，并且在停船的地方建立储粪池和公共厕所，供给渔民船户使用，杜绝粪便污染水源的机会。同时还应当教育渔民尽量少跟河水接触，帮助渔民改进生产工具，提倡下水的时候穿双层布袜或桐油布袜，以预防血吸虫病。
    在血吸虫病流行地区，妇女感染血吸虫病的百分比也很高，主要原因是在河里洗衣淘米、采菱采藕而受到感染；同时粪便污染水源主要因素之一——每天在河里洗马桶，也多是妇女所做的。因此流行地区的民主妇女联合会和其他群众团体，应当积极配合卫生部门做好粪便管理，切实教育妇女做到一律不在河里洗马桶、粪具，一律饮用井水，必须用河水的时候，应该加热到烫手程度（饮水必须煮沸）或用漂白粉消毒后再用。同时还应该做好其他方面的预防措施。
    在全面开展防治血吸虫病的工作中，还必须要有宣传、出版机关的配合。例如，编写和出版有关防治血吸虫病的宣传画、连环画、歌谣、幻灯片和通俗小册子等，供给血吸虫病流行地区向群众进行宣传教育。教育部门还应当编印补充教材，发给血吸虫病流行地区的学校、夜校，增加防治血吸虫病的课目。
    此外，在血吸虫病流行地区的公安部门也应当积极协同卫生部门开展防治工作，进行卫生宣传教育，经常督促检查居民、学校、机关、团体和其他部门对各项预防措施的执行情况，并且及时批评和表扬，共同推进防治血吸虫病的工作。
    总之，防治血吸虫病是一项艰巨的任务，各部门应当在各级党政机关的统一领导下，积极和主动地协同卫生部门做好这一工作。卫生部门必须在工作中主动地和其他部门联系，取得配合，并且供给其他部门以防治血吸虫病的资料，对重要问题的解决，应当和其他部门共同商量。只有这样，才能把防治血吸虫病的工作做好，使血吸虫病最后完全消灭。
