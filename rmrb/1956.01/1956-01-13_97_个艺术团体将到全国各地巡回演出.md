97 Art Troupes to Tour the Country

This year, 97 state-run art troupes and private professional opera troupes will tour major cities and some medium-sized cities across the country. This was stipulated in the tour performance contracts signed on the 11th in Beijing by the heads of cultural bureaus, art troupes, and theaters from 21 provinces, cities, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

The majority of the above-mentioned art troupes will also perform in factories, mines, rural areas, and military units across the country.

The seven art troupes directly under the Ministry of Culture, including the China Peking Opera Theatre, the Central Experimental Opera House, the Central Song and Dance Troupe, the China Pingju Opera Theatre, and the China Acrobatic Troupe, have all accepted invitations from various regions and will set off separately starting in February. Many local opera troupes from various regions that have never or rarely performed outside the region will also meet audiences across the country on a wide scale.

    97个艺术团体将到全国各地巡回演出
    今年全国将有97个国营艺术团体和民间职业剧团在各大城市和部分中等城市巡回演出，这是21个省、市和内蒙古自治区的文化局、艺术团体和剧场的负责人11日在北京签订的巡回演出合同中规定的。
    上述大部分艺术团体还要到各地的工厂、矿山、农村和部队中去演出。
    文化部直属的中国京剧院、中央实验歌剧院、中央歌舞团、中国评剧院、中国杂技团等七个艺术团体，都已经接受各地邀请，将从2月开始分别出发。各地许多从来没有或者很少到外地演出的地方戏曲团体也都将广泛地同各地观众见面。
