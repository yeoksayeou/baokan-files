    Use Vivid Facts to Break Down Conservative Thinking
    Yang Zhongshu, Secretary of the CPC Committee of Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory
    The process of formulating the 1956 annual plan for Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory was also a process of overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking.

    According to the plan compiled by Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory for 1956, the annual output of the factory's main products would reach 323.62% of the 1955 output; the total output value in 1956 would reach 286.22% of the total output value in 1955. According to this plan, Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory would complete the targets of the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in July 1956.

    Can this advanced production plan be completed? The answer is a definite yes. However, it is necessary to first eliminate the current right-leaning conservative thinking inside and outside the Party. Otherwise, this plan cannot be completed.

    The right-leaning conservative thinking among the workers of Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory is mainly manifested in being afraid of everything. Some people worry about the factory's backward management, some worry about the equipment not being good enough, some worry about the lack of technical personnel, and so on.

    Based on these circumstances, the factory Party committee first convened an expanded cadre meeting attended by all factory section chiefs, workshop directors, heads of Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations, and engineers, leading everyone to discuss whether there were conditions to complete this advanced production plan. At the meeting, everyone launched a critique of various conservative ideas. For example, when some people believed that "working hours cannot be suddenly reduced," others disagreed, citing the fact that in the second half of 1955, due to strengthened management and the implementation of technological innovation, the unit working hours of products decreased by 32%. This meeting convinced those present that there was an objective basis for completing the advanced production plan, thereby increasing confidence.

    After raising the confidence of the cadres, the factory Party committee conducted in-depth propaganda and education work on the Five-Year Plan among the workers. In the propaganda and education, it was particularly pointed out that in the situation of the leap-forward development of agricultural cooperativization and the rapid transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the speed of industrialization must also be accelerated; at the same time, there are also conditions to accelerate the pace of advancement. After this kind of propaganda and education, the workers' enthusiasm for labor soared, and they unanimously expressed their desire to tap the potential of every department in the factory. Yu Renhan, the foreman of the gear section in the machining workshop, went to each machine tool and process to work with the workers to tap potential. With his help, lathe operator Liu Lanting used the Soviet Kolesov tool method to improve the angle of the lathe tool and simplify the process, completing 18 hours of work in 8 hours. This experience is very valuable. If all lathes adopt Liu Lanting's advanced working methods to improve work, production efficiency can be increased by 296%, and 3,084 parts can be processed throughout the year. If the entire section learns from Liu Lanting's advanced experience, improves tools, simplifies processes, and reduces auxiliary time, the grinding machine can increase production efficiency by 66%; one person can watch two gear hobbing machines, and other types of work can also improve efficiency by about 55%. The entire section can improve production efficiency by 66.6%, and 1,169 units can be processed throughout the year. The Party organization publicized this advanced working method.

    In order to further eliminate right-leaning conservative thinking, the Party committee held a technical performance competition for the entire lathe operator trade on December 27, 1955. Advanced workers achieved new results in this performance competition. Liu Lanting and Dou Yusheng both increased production efficiency by 850%; Youth League member Shi Xingbang adopted the Soviet high-speed threading method, increasing work efficiency by 170%; Youth League members Wang Weiliang and Yuan Xingmao improved operations, increasing production efficiency by 250%; Gao Quanhai improved fixtures and tools, increasing production efficiency by 900%.

    These vivid facts not only powerfully convinced those with conservative ideas, but also strengthened the confidence of all employees in completing the plan. The workshop director originally believed that it would be necessary to transfer 104 more workers to complete the advanced plan, but now he withdrew this opinion. The factory director also said: "I was initially worried that the original plan could not be completed, and I had even less confidence in this advanced plan. Now it seems that it can be completed. The problem is that I have conservative thinking myself."

    Currently, the factory Party committee is comprehensively mobilizing the masses to revise the guarantee conditions; at the same time, it is continuing to wage a resolute struggle against various right-leaning conservative ideas.

### 用生动的事实打破保守思想

    用生动的事实打破保守思想
    中共济南第一机床厂党委书记　杨忠恕
    济南第一机床厂制定1956年年度计划的过程，也是克服右倾保守思想的过程。
    按照济南第一机床厂1956年编制的计划，全厂全年主要产品的产量将达到1955年产量的323.62％；1956年的总产值将达到1955年总产值的286.22％。按照这个计划，济南第一机床厂就在1956年7月提前完成了第一个五年计划的指标。
    这个先进的生产计划能不能完成呢？肯定地说是能够完成的。但是必须首先清除目前党内党外的右倾保守思想。否则，这个计划是完不成的。
    济南第一机床厂职工中的右倾保守思想主要表现在前怕龙，后怕虎。有些人担心工厂管理落后，有些人担心设备不够好，有些人担心技术人员少等等。
    根据这些情况，工厂党委首先召开了有全厂科长、车间主任、党团工会负责人和工程师等参加的扩大干部会议，领导大家讨论究竟有没有条件完成这个先进的生产计划。会议上，大家展开了对各种保守思想的批判。例如当有些人认为“工时不能突然下降”的时候，就有人表示不同意，举出一个事实：1955年下半年，由于加强了管理，推行了技术革新，产品单位工时下降了32％。这次会议使到会者都相信完成先进的生产计划是有客观根据的，因而增加了信心。
    在提高干部的信心后，工厂党委就深入车间对工人群众进行了五年计划的宣传教育工作。在宣传教育中，特别指出了在农业合作化飞跃发展和资本主义工商业改造迅速进行的形势下，工业化的速度也必须加快；同时，也有条件加快速度前进。经过这种宣传教育，工人群众的劳动热情高涨，他们一致表示要把全厂每个部门的潜力都挖掘出来。加工车间齿轮工段的工长于仁汉到每个机床、工序中去和工人一起挖掘潜力，在他帮助下，车工刘兰亭运用苏联科列索夫车刀法改进车刀角度，简化工序，8小时内就完成了18小时的工作量。这个经验是非常宝贵的，如果所有车床都采取刘兰亭的先进工作方法来改进工作，生产效率就可以提高296％，全年可加工3，084台的零件。如果全工段都学习刘兰亭的先进经验，改进工具，简化工序，减少辅助时间，磨齿机就可以提高生产效率66％；滚齿机一个人可以看两台，其他工种也可提高效率55％左右。全工段可提高生产效率66.6％，全年可加工1，169台。党组织就宣传了这个先进工作方法。
    为了进一步清除右倾保守思想，党委会在1955年12月27日又举行了整个车工工种的技术表演竞赛。先进工作者在这次表演竞赛中都得到了新的成绩，刘兰亭和窦玉升生产效率都提高了850％；青年团员石兴邦采用了苏联高速车丝法，工作效率提高了170％；青年团员王维良、袁兴茂改进了操作，生产效率提高了250％；高泉海改进卡具、工具，生产效率提高了900％。
    这些生动的事实不但有力地说服了有保守思想的人，而且使全体职工增强了完成计划的信心。车间主任本来认为要完成先进计划非得增调104个工人不可，现在撤回了这个意见。厂长也说：“我开始对原来的计划也担心完不成，对这个先进计划更没有信心，现在看来是可以完成的，问题是自己有保守思想。”
    目前工厂党委正在全面地发动群众修订保证条件；同时，继续同各种右倾保守思想作坚决的斗争。
