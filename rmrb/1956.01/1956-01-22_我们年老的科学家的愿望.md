    The Wishes of Our Elderly Scientists
    Mao Yisheng, Director of the Railway Research Institute of the Ministry of Railways
    I am an elderly intellectual, and I often associate with intellectuals of my generation, so I understand some of their situations. Without exception, they all trust the Party and support the Party. They study every day, gradually improving their political awareness and professional skills. They all feel younger than before, and, strangely, their health is much better than before. Several retired engineers have said that although they are older, they are stronger and willing to rejoin the workforce. All of this shows that elderly intellectuals are making progress and want to become laboring intellectuals, contributing all their strength to the great socialist construction.
    However, in the past six years, the strength of us elderly intellectuals has been contributed too little compared to the young people. Today, seeing the booming agricultural cooperation movement and the joyful scenes of celebrating the joint state-private ownership all over the streets, we cannot help but feel ashamed. Our actions have been slower. The "effective lifespan" of us old people is getting shorter and shorter after all, and we should work harder than those with longer effective lifespans!
    Of course, we old people are relatively unlucky. At the time of liberation, we were already over fifty years old. Although we had accumulated more than 50 years of knowledge and experience, there was a lot of dross in it. It takes a lot of effort to remove this dross, but the most effort is spent on removing the ideological baggage brought from the old society. Compared with young people, we do much more non-productive work in this area, thus affecting the speed of our progress. Only those who are ideologically liberated can consciously exert their enthusiasm. Among us elderly intellectuals, many have been liberated ideologically, sooner or later, but still far from being completely liberated, and therefore urgently need to strengthen political study to better carry out ideological transformation and unleash greater potential.
    An engineer much older than me said that he felt everything was good after liberation, except for one thing he was not used to: Party cadres, regardless of age, were too polite to him and not close enough, making it inconvenient for him to say some things. He specifically pointed out that in some organs, between the director and deputy director, if one of them is a Party member, there is also this situation of mutual respect but not closeness. He believes that this is detrimental to improving political and professional levels.
    Speaking of professional work, many old engineers talked to me about their feelings about learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. They unanimously believe that the level of Soviet science and technology is very high and should be learned. However, our learning methods are sometimes not necessarily correct. They cited many examples to illustrate that due to formalism divorced from reality and mechanically copying, in the name of learning from the Soviet Union, it has instead caused losses to the country and the people. Sometimes, the situation is not fully reflected to Soviet experts, but the conclusions drawn by Soviet experts are regarded as golden rules, which is also very harmful. Here, some old engineers believe that their past attitude of standing idly by was also too irresponsible, and they should thoroughly correct their mistakes in the future and actively participate in learning.
    In the past, old engineers greatly admired British and American technology, so in the early days of learning from the Soviet Union, they could not help but reveal a resistant mood. Later, after fully understanding Soviet science and technology, they dared not even mention British and American technology, putting all British and American books on the shelf, fearing that people would say they were politically backward. In fact, in science and technology, our government has repeatedly called for learning from the beneficial experiences of all countries, and their concerns are really unnecessary.
    Some old scientists and old engineers have reflected some opinions to me, which are worth considering. One is about the issue of confidentiality. Science and technology need to be improved through the exchange of experience, but in the exchange, it is inevitable to touch upon the issue of confidentiality. The scope of confidentiality in science and technology should be stipulated as soon as possible. The second is about technical policy issues. Engineering design must have specifications, and the level of standards in the specifications must be determined by the country's technical policy. However, we have not announced such a policy, so in the design, we cannot help but refer to Soviet standards, but being too high is a waste, and being too low is inevitably conservative, making us at a loss. The third is about the issue of meetings. Not only are there too many meetings during working hours, affecting work, but also there are many meetings at night and on Sundays, which further affects health. In fact, the problem often lies not in the meeting but in how to hold it. Some people suggest that for all meetings, the starting and ending times, along with the content of the meeting, should be notified to the participants in advance so that they can prepare early and arrange their time. If the chairman can manage the meeting well, this is entirely possible. In the Soviet Union, there are meetings of 30 minutes, or even 10 minutes. Secondly, all reports of a general dissemination nature do not need to be held, as long as the content of the dissemination is written into a document and distributed to everyone to read themselves, because reading a manuscript is much faster than listening to a lecture. Furthermore, large reports can be listened to or recorded and rebroadcast using telephone lines to expand the audience and better arrange listening time, which is more convenient for older people. At the same time, this also saves time and money on transportation. The fourth is about working conditions. What scientists and engineers hope for is to be able to read quietly at home and have books to read, because some research work must be carried out day and night, in piles of books. However, these two things are not simple, so some people suggest that the salary and benefits of scientific and technical personnel do not need to be particularly special, as long as they can be sufficiently satisfied in these two things. In addition, regarding writing books, some scientists have to use the "four selfs" method, in addition to writing themselves, they also have to look up books themselves, draw themselves, and copy themselves. They hope to have assistants to help, which is also a kind of training for the assistants. Fifth is about the training of young scientific workers. All the scientists and engineers I have come into contact with have expressed great joy at the growth of the younger generation and are willing to unreservedly impart all our useful, albeit limited, knowledge to them. They also respect us old people very much. However, because everyone is busy with work, there is inevitably too little contact between us. I hope that young people can also have more time, like old people, to do more research work. We also feel that for female scientists, due to the added burden of family, the time problem is really serious, especially if they want to compete with male comrades in work and study, which hinders normal life and health even more. I hope that more care can be given to them in these aspects. Sixth are some individual issues. Some people have particularly idle work, and they can only study all day long, especially in some schools, where some teachers have no classes to teach and can be idle for one or two years, still waiting. Some people were very excited to see Vice President Liu Xianzhou join the Party, and they also had some eagerness to try; but they were afraid of "making a fool of themselves," so although they had this intention, they dared not speak out. Some people's scientific and technical books written before liberation are actually still useful, but now bookstores are unwilling to sell them.
    Of course, the above opinions are not necessarily mature, but some opinions are worth considering carefully.
    Looking back, we ourselves should also think about what opinions the country will put forward to us? I think there are probably quite a few. We elderly scientists should contribute all the strength of our remaining years, and under the leadership of the Party, work with scientists across the country to strive to develop our country's scientific cause and strive to catch up with the world's scientific level within the three five-year plan periods!

    我们年老的科学家的愿望
    铁道部铁道研究所所长　茅以升
    我是个年老的知识分子，我时常和同辈的知识分子在一起，了解到他们的一些情况。他们都毫无例外地信任党，拥护党。他们天天学习，都在逐步地提高政治觉悟和业务水平。他们都感到比以前年青了，而且，很奇怪，身体也比以前好多了。有几位退休的工程师都说他们虽然年更富但是力也更强，很愿意从新参加工作。这一切都说明了，年老的知识分子都在进步，都想成为劳动知识分子，在伟大的社会主义建设中，贡献出一切力量。
    然而，在过去六年中，我们年老的知识分子的力量，比起年轻人，究竟是贡献得太少了。今天看到轰轰烈烈的农业合作化运动和满街庆祝公私合营的欢乐景象，我们都不由地感到惭愧。我们的行动是慢了一些。我们年老的人的“有效寿命”究竟是越来越短的，我们应当比他们有效寿命更长的人更加努力！
    当然，我们年老的人是比较倒霉的。解放的时候，我们已经年过半百了，虽说是累积了50年以上的知识和经验，但那里面的糟粕是非常之多的。清除这些糟粕就很费力，然而最费力的还是清除从旧社会带来的思想包袱。比起年轻人来，我们在这方面的非生产性工作就做得多得多，因而影响到我们前进的速度。只有在思想上解放了的人们才能自觉地发挥出他们的积极性。我们年老的知识分子中间，已经有很多人在思想上或先或后地解放了，但离彻底解放还远，因而迫切要求加强政治学习，来更好地进行思想改造，更大地发挥潜力。
    一位比我老得多的工程师对我说，他觉得解放以后，样样事都好，就只一件事不惯，就是党员干部不论老少，对他都是客气有余，亲近不足，弄得他有些话都不便说了。他特别指出，在某些机关的正副职之间，其中如有一位是党员，也有这种彼此尊而不亲的情况。他认为这对于提高政治和业务的水平都是有妨碍的。
    谈到业务，很多老工程师对我谈起关于学习苏联先进经验的感想。他们一致认为苏联的科学技术的水平是非常高的，是应该学习的。但是我们的学习方法有时候却不一定正确。他们举出很多例子来说明，由于脱离实际，生搬硬套的形式主义作风，在学习苏联的名义下，反而造成了对国家人民的损失。有时候对苏联专家反映情况不全面，但却把苏联专家由此得出的结论当做金科玉律，这也是很有害的。在这里，有些老工程师认为他们过去袖手旁观的态度也是太不负责了，今后应该痛改前非，积极参加学习。
    在过去，老工程师们对于英美的技术是十分崇拜的，因此在学习苏联的初期不由地流露出抗拒的情绪。后来对苏联的科学技术有了充分的认识，就对英美的技术提也不敢提了，把所有英美书籍束之高阁，生怕人说他政治上落后。其实，在科学技术上，我们政府曾一再号召要学习所有国家的对我们有益的经验，他们这些顾虑实是多余的。
    有些老科学家、老工程师对我反映了一些意见，值得提出考虑。一是关于保密问题。科学技术是要靠交流经验来提高的，但在交流中总不免要触及保密问题，究竟在科学技术上，保密的范围如何，似应早日规定。二是关于技术政策问题。工程设计要有规范，规范里标准的高低要决定于国家的技术政策。但是我们还没有公布过这种政策，因而设计的时候就不免要参考苏联的标准，但偏高就是浪费，偏低又不免保守，弄得无所适从。三是关于开会问题。不但工作时间内的会太多，影响到工作；而且夜晚和星期日的会也多，更影响到健康。其实，问题往往不在会而在如何开。有人建议，凡是开会应当把开始的钟点和结束的钟点，连同开会内容，预先通知参加的人，以便早作准备，安排自己的时间。如果做主席的能很好地掌握会场，这是完全可以做得到的。在苏联就有30分钟，乃至10分钟的会。其次，凡是一般传达性质的报告会都不必开，只要把传达内容写成书面，发给大家自阅好了，因为看稿要比听讲快得多。再其次，大报告可以利用电话线收听或录音转播，以便扩大听众范围，并且可以更好地安排收听时间，这对年老的人是较为方便的。同时，这也节省了交通的时间和费用。四是关于工作条件问题。科学家们和工程师们所希望的只是回家后能安静读书和有书可读，因为有些研究工作是要夜以继日，在书堆中进行的。然而这两件事就不简单，因此有人建议，对于科学技术人员的工资待遇并不需要如何特别，只要能在这两件事上相当满足，就够好了。此外，关于写书，有些科学家不得不用“四自”办法，除自写外，还要自己查书、自画、自抄。他们希望能有助手帮忙，这对助手来说，也是一种培养。五是关于青年科学工作者的培养问题。所有我所接触到的科学家和工程师们对于年青一代的成长都表示万分喜悦，都愿意毫无保留地把我们有用的虽然是有限的知识全部传授给他们。他们也非常尊重我们这些年老的人。不过，由于大家工作忙，彼此之间的接触是不免太少了一些。希望年青的人也能和年老的人一样，都能有更充分的时间，来多做些研究工作。我们更感觉到对于女科学家们，由于多一重家庭担负，时间问题实是严重，特别是她们要在工作和学习上和男同志们竞赛，这就更妨碍了正常的生活和健康。希望在这些方面能对她们多多照顾。六是一些个别问题。有的人工作特别清闲，只好终日学习，特别是在某些学校里，有的教师无课可开，竟可闲散一两年之久，仍在等待。有的人看到刘仙洲副校长入党，非常兴奋，也有些跃跃欲试的心情；但终恐“贻笑大方”，虽有此心，不敢出口。有的人在解放前写的科学技术书籍，其实还有用，但现在各书店都不肯出售了。
    当然，以上的意见不一定都成熟，但有些意见是很值得慎重考虑的。
    回过头来，我们自己还应该想一想，国家会向我们提出些什么意见来呢？我想恐怕不少。我们年老的科学家们应当把有生之年的所有的力量全部贡献出来，在党的领导下，同全国科学工作者一道，努力发展我国的科学事业，为在三个五年计划期内赶上世界科学水平而奋斗！
