Various provinces and cities have successively carried out the work of handling reactionary, obscene, and absurd books and periodicals in the past six months, and have achieved remarkable results. Many provinces and cities, such as Guangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, Liaoning, and Jilin, have already or are about to enter the stage of arranging and transforming book and periodical rental businesses. Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan and other cities are now carrying out publicity and handling work.

Before handling these materials, all provinces and cities carried out publicity to the broad masses through various activities and obtained the support of the broad masses. They also mobilized the book rental stalls and organized them to study. The vast majority of book rental stalls support the policies of the People's Government. According to reports from various regions, the policies of the People's Government are very clear and the care for book rental stalls is very thoughtful. Some book stalls in Henan Province even voluntarily reported the illegal books and periodicals that they had secretly smuggled and hidden.

After handling illegal books and periodicals in many areas, the masses have formed a good atmosphere of resisting bad books and reading good books. More than 90 young people in the Changchun Flour Mill who used to read absurd and obscene novels are now vying to read books such as "Dedicate Everything to the Party". Because the content of the rented books has changed, the masses have also begun to change their views on them. There is a primary school near Xie Tingbai's book rental stall in Changsha City, Hunan Province. In the past, teachers always escorted students past his book stall after school before they felt relieved to go back. Now the teachers no longer do that. After the handling, the business of the book rental stalls has also been rising.

Many regions are further adopting various methods to arrange and transform book rental stalls, so that they can become book circulation places led by the state and serve the new culture. The novel rental industry in Jilin and Changchun cities in Jilin Province and larger county towns has all been changed to half selling new books and half renting novels, comic strips, and other businesses, and has generally established wholesale and sales relationships with Xinhua Bookstores. After the five book stalls on Xiaowu Road in Changchun City established wholesale and sales relationships with bookstores, they sold a large number of popular reading materials.

Some regions that started handling work later will also end the handling within a limited time.

    各地处理反动、淫秽、荒诞书刊
    各省、市半年以来先后进行了处理反动、淫秽、荒诞书刊的工作，取得了显著成绩。有许多省、市，如广西、湖南、四川、江西、江苏、河南、河北、辽宁、吉林等，已经或即将转入对书刊租赁业者安排改造阶段。北京、天津、上海、武汉等市，现在正进行宣传和处理工作。
    各省、市在处理以前，都通过各种活动，向广大群众进行宣传，得到了广大群众的支持；对租书铺摊也进行动员，组织他们学习。绝大多数租书铺摊对人民政府的政策都很拥护。各地反映，人民政府的政策非常明确，对租书铺摊照顾很周到。河南省有的书摊，把偷运密藏的违法书刊也自动地报告出来。
    许多地区经过处理违法书刊，群众形成了一种抵制坏书、阅读好书的良好风气。长春市制粉厂有90多个青年过去常看荒诞、淫秽小说，现在竞先阅读“把一切献给党”等书了。租书铺摊由于改变了租书的内容，群众也开始改变了对他们的看法。湖南长沙市谢廷柏租书铺摊附近有一个小学，过去放学的时候，教员总要护送学生走过他的书摊以后才放心回去，现在教员不那样做了。处理以后，租书铺摊的营业也日渐上升。
    许多地区正进一步采取多种多样办法对租书铺摊进行安排改造工作，以使他们成为国家领导的图书流通场所，为新文化服务。吉林省的吉林、长春两市和较大县城的小说租赁业，已经全部改为半出售新书，半出租小说、连环画等业务，普遍和新华书店建立了批销关系。长春市小五马路的五家书铺，和书店建立了批销关系以后，销售了大量的通俗读物。
    开始处理工作较迟的部分地区，也将限期处理结束。
