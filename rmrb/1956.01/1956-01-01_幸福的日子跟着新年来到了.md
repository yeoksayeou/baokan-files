　　Happy Days Arrive with the New Year
　　Jiao Fuxing, Head of the Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangqing Township, Yuci County
　　I am the head of the Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangqing Township, Yuci County, Shanxi Province. Once the New Year passes, our cooperative will transform into a fully socialist advanced agricultural production cooperative. This is the greatest joyous event for the generations of Zhangqing Village.

　　Although our area is a fertile plain, the lives of the farmers used to be very hard. Since the establishment of the agricultural cooperative, the lives of the farmers have begun to improve. Especially after we got a tractor in June 1954, everything changed dramatically. The crops stretch as far as the eye can see, hundreds of acres in one large field. Member Gang Suo then looked at the yellow wheat fields and happily sang, "Plots are connected, crops are uniformly lush." In 1955, our wheat yielded an average of 340 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 480 jin. Some elderly people said happily: I have lived for so many years and have never seen such good wheat. After the autumn harvest, in addition to paying the public grain and selling 1.29 million jin of surplus grain, each member received about 500 jin of rations, and each workday was worth 1.7 yuan. The elderly, widowed, weak, and those who lost their labor power also received rations and pocket money. Su Yinglian, an elderly widow in her 50s, used to beg from door to door, lacking food and clothing. After joining the cooperative, she earned more than 70 workdays a year by picking cotton, pruning branches, peeling hemp, and winnowing sunflowers, receiving 550 jin of grain and 79 yuan. She no longer worried about food, clothing, and pocket money. Some members even bought bicycles and went out to fairs and theaters, a row of more than a dozen. Farmers outside the cooperative were very impressed and every household asked to join the cooperative.

　　With consecutive years of good harvests and the availability of tractors, the members were no longer satisfied with the elementary cooperative. They said, "The cooperative's production must continuously improve, and it is not feasible for land, livestock, and farm implements to remain in individual hands." Indeed, the private ownership but public use of the means of production could no longer meet the requirements for developing production. For example, members were biased in the management of livestock. In the spring of 1955, in order to match strong and weak livestock, the cooperative assigned Li Xiaobai's mule to the fifth production team, while he himself was in the tenth team. He was very dissatisfied with the transfer of his livestock and became emotional in production. Member Wang Fulan fed more feed to his own mule and less to others' mules. His mule was fat, and the others' mules were thin. Guo Junniu, Zhou Sanni, and other members with more land wandered around the streets during the spring planting season when everyone was busy. Their attitude was: Whether we work or not, the land dividend is enough to live on. Therefore, the poor farmer members were very dissatisfied. The annual income of Han Quanwa, with three laborers, was not even as high as the annual income of Hou You'er, a prosperous middle peasant with only one and a half laborers (because he had 60 mu of land). In the spring of 1955, many members submitted requests to the cooperative committee to transition to an advanced cooperative. They said: "The more you work, the more you earn. It only makes sense to live a good life by relying on labor." At the members' meeting on November 19 to celebrate the harvest, we officially announced the plan to transition to an advanced cooperative.

　　Our Shuguang Cooperative implemented a fixed land remuneration system in the winter of 1954, with a remuneration of only six jin of grain per shi of output. Eliminating land remuneration is not a problem. Over the past three years, we have accumulated public property worth more than 43,000 yuan, including 17,330 yuan for public accumulation funds and public welfare funds. By taking out a portion of the accumulation fund and having the members contribute some share funds, we can solve the funding problem for assessing and transferring livestock, farm implements, etc., to the cooperative. By extracting 10% from the public welfare fund, we can solve the living problems of the elderly, widowed, weak, disabled, and impoverished households within the cooperative. Of course, there will be ideological struggles among the members when transforming the millennia-old private ownership system into a collective ownership system. But as long as we can correctly implement the Party's policies and explain the reasons to the members, all problems can be solved.

　　To welcome the joyous event of transitioning to an advanced cooperative after the New Year, we are very busy now. The cooperative committee is handling the assessment of livestock and farm implements on the one hand, and revising the 1956 production plan on the other hand. What about the members? They are busy collecting manure day and night. Old member Li Jiangman originally planned to just live a few more days and be done with it. Hearing that the cooperative would become advanced and that life in the future would be much better than now, he dismissed the thought of dying. He used the money he had saved for a coffin to buy sheep. He gets up early every day to collect manure. The members all say: Mutual aid groups, agricultural cooperatives, each step is better than the last. The happy days that we farmers have been longing for for thousands of years are about to arrive with the New Year! (Written by Yang Junrui)

### 幸福的日子跟着新年来到了

　　幸福的日子跟着新年来到了
    榆次县张庆乡曙光农业生产合作社社长　焦福兴
    我是山西省榆次县张庆乡曙光农业生产合作社的社长。一过新年，我们的社就要转成完全社会主义的高级农业生产合作社了。这是我们张庆村祖辈以来的大喜事。
    我们这里，虽然是个平川肥沃的地区，但过去农民的生活是很苦的。自从成立了农业合作社，农民的生活开始好起来。特别是1954年6月有了拖拉机，一切都大变样了。什么庄稼也是一眼望不到头，几百亩一大片。社员钢锁则望着那黄沙沙的麦田，高兴的唱起来：“地块连成片，庄稼一色齐”。1955年我们的麦子平均每亩打到340斤，最高的打到480斤。有的老年人高兴地说：活了这么大年纪，从来也没见过这么好的麦子。收罢秋收，除缴了公粮，卖了129万斤余粮以外，每个社员还分到口粮五百斤左右，每个劳动日分到1.7元。孤寡老弱丧失劳动力的社员，也分下了粮食和零花钱。50多岁的孤老婆宿英莲，过去东求西借，少吃没穿。入社以后，在棉花地里打?修枝，剥大麻，簸葵花，一年做下70多个劳动日，分到550斤粮食，79元钱。吃穿、零花钱都不发愁了。有些社员还买下自行车，出去赶会看戏，一排就是十几辆。社外农民看着的直说好，家家户户要求入社。
    又是连年丰收，又有了拖拉机，社员们对低级社再不能满足了，都说：合作社的生产要不断提高，土地、牲口、农具还掌握在各人的手里是不行的。的确，过去生产资料的私有公用，已经不能满足发展生产的要求。比如，社员对牲口的管理就有偏心。1955年春天，社里为了把强弱牲口搭配好，把李小白的骡子编到第五生产队，他本人在第十队，把牲口调走了很不满意，在生产上闹情绪。社员王福兰，喂牲口料的时候，喂自己的骡子多，喂人家的骡子少。他的骡子肥，人家的骡子瘦。土地多的社员郭俊牛、周三妮等，开春种地啦，大家忙的不赢，他们在街上游串。他们的态度是：劳动不劳动，土地分红就够生活啦。因此，贫农社员很不满意。韩全娃三个劳力一年的收入还赶不上富裕中农侯有儿一个半劳力一年的收入（因为他有60亩土地）。1955年春天，就有许多社员向社务委员会提出了转高级社的要求。他们说：劳动的多，挣的多，靠劳动过好光景才算话。在11月19日庆祝丰收的社员大会上，我们正式宣布了要转高级社。
    我们曙光社，1954年冬天就实行了土地固定报酬制，一石产量报酬只六斤粮食。取消土地报酬没什么问题。三年来，我们积累公共财产共值43，000多元，其中公积金、公益金17，330元。拿出一部分公积金，社员再摊些股份基金，就可以解决牲口、农具等作价归社的资金问题。社内的孤寡老弱、无劳力的困难户，从公益金中抽出10％，就可以解决他们的生活问题。当然，把遗传几千年的私有制变成集体所有制，社员的思想斗争不是没有的。但只要我们能正确执行党的政策，向社员讲清道理，一切问题都是能够解决的。
    为了迎接新年后转成高级社的喜事，我们现在可忙啦，社务委员会一方面在处理牲口农具作价的问题，一方面在修订1956年的生产计划。社员们呢？每天都在起早贪黑地忙着积肥。老社员李江蛮，原打算瞎活几天就算啦，听到要转高级社，将来的生活比现在美得多。老死的心思打消了。把买棺材的钱买成羊。天天早早起来，拾粪积肥。社员们都说：互助组，农业合作社，一步比一步好，我们农民几千年来熬盼的幸福日子就要跟着新年来到啦！（杨君瑞代笔）
