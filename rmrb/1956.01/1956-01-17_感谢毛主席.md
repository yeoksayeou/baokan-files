    Thank You Chairman Mao
    Nie Yougen
    The private sector personnel in Tianjin who have undergone the conversion to joint state-private ownership in all trades are praising Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for their care and consideration these days.
    After the cotton cloth industry officially hung up the sign of joint state-private ownership, the small and medium-sized stores that were previously short of funds and had empty shelves were now allocated goods by the head office, and the shelves were full. The enthusiasm of the employees in the joint venture is very high. The employees of Qian Xiang Yi Chen Ji started a rush inventory of goods at 8:30 pm the night before the sign was hung, and continued until 4 am. They opened for business as usual after dawn. Buyers also have a different view of the store. Usually, the daily sales are 4,000 to 6,000 yuan, but on the first day of the hanging of the sign, they sold 12,000 yuan. Wang Xianzhou, the original manager of Qian Xiang Yi Chen Ji, who is now the deputy director of the Joint State-Private Cotton Cloth Management Office, said: "In the past, I always thought that I was over 60 years old, my eyes were blurred, my left ear was a little deaf, and my legs were slow, so I just had the idea of ​​living one day at a time. I didn't expect the government to assign me the position of deputy director of the Joint State-Private Cotton Cloth Management Office. I have changed from a capitalist of a private store to a half-public person, and I can gradually become a self-reliant worker. This is all thanks to the bright road that Chairman Mao has shown us. In fact, I am only 62 years old this year, which is not too old. If you count it, I will only be 73 years old when the Third Five-Year Plan is completed. I will study hard, transform myself, and contribute to socialist construction. When the socialist society is built in the future, I will also have a share in the happy life."
    In joint state-private enterprises, many of the former managers of small and medium-sized stores are even more excited about the joint venture of the entire industry. Zhang Junshan, the manager of the United Outlet of the Hebei Avenue New Medicine Main Store, said: "I never dreamed that our small store of 4 people could also participate in the joint state-private ownership." The original United Pharmacy was merged by 3 pharmacies in Hexing Shopping Mall and Machang Road in August last year. In the past, because of decentralized operations, poor location, and little capital, it only sold a few hundred yuan per month, and sometimes it was not even enough to cover the costs. Later, under the guidance of the state-owned pharmaceutical company, the 3 companies merged into 1 and moved to Hongqiao District, where there are fewer pharmacies. Since it opened in September last year, business has slowly improved, and by November last year, it had a slight surplus. In the old society, the big fish eat the small fish, you squeeze me, I squeeze you, and many small households like us were squeezed out. We can have today's life only thanks to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for arranging it well for us. In the past, I always thought that I was called a bourgeois, which was very distressing. Now I realize the future: as long as I study hard and work hard, I will be able to become a member of the working class in the future."
    Among the salespeople in Yuanlong Outlet of the Second Cotton Cloth Main Store in Gu Yi Street, there were several small vendors who used to set up stalls. After the joint venture of the entire industry was approved, they were merged here. They received enthusiastic help from the original employees here. Even developing invoices was taught by the employees hand in hand. They recalled that when they used to set up stalls on the street, they were afraid of cloudy and rainy days in summer, and they would lose money if the goods got wet; in winter, they were afraid of windy and snowy days without buyers, and they didn't dare to think about the future, just muddling through day by day. Now, participating in joint ventures, there is hope for the future. Vendor Wu Jitong said: "I knew that socialism was good in the past, but I always thought that I didn't have the travel expenses (referring to funds), and I was afraid that I would not be able to get to socialism. This time, Chairman Mao's instructions on the joint venture of the entire industry are really thoughtful, not only considering the big households, but also taking care of the small vendors like us with one or two people. In the past, there was no purpose in life, but now Chairman Mao has led us to the main road, and whether we can walk it depends on the individual. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, and we will go wherever Chairman Mao points us."

### 感谢毛主席

    感谢毛主席
    聂有根
    天津市实行全行业公私合营的私方人员，这些天到处称颂着毛主席和共产党对他们的关怀和照顾。
    棉布业正式挂上公私合营的招牌以后，过去因为资金不足，货架空空的中小商店，现在都由总店拨去了货物，货架子摆得满满的。职工们在合营中的热情十分饱满。谦祥益辰记的职工在挂牌前一天晚上8点半上了门以后，就突击盘点货物，一直盘到清晨4点，天亮以后又照常营业。买主对商店的看法也不一样了，平常门市每天卖4，000元到6，000元，挂牌的头一天就卖了12，000元。谦祥益辰记原来的经理，现在担任公私合营棉布管理处副主任的王仙舟说：“过去总想自己是60多岁的人了，眼睛也花了，左耳又有点聋，腿也慢了，就有点过一天算一天的思想。没想到现在政府还分配自己担任公私合营棉布管理处的副主任的职务。从私营商店的资本家变成了半公家人，而且还可以一步一步地变成为自食其力的劳动者。这都是走的毛主席给我们指示的光明大道。其实，我今年62岁，还不算太老。算一算，完成第三个五年计划我才73岁。我要好好学习，改造自己，在社会主义建设里出一份力量。将来社会主义社会建成时，幸福生活也还有我一份。”
    在公私合营企业里，许多过去是中小商店的经理，他们对全行业合营的兴奋劲更是无可比拟。河北大街新药总店联合门市部的经理张俊善说：“过去做梦也想不到我们这4个人的小店也能够参加公私合营。”原来的联合药房是由过去在合兴商场和马场道的3家药商在去年8月间合并起来的。过去因为分散经营，地点不好，资金又少，每月只卖几百元，有时连本都不够。后来在国营医药公司的指导下，3家合并成1家，并且搬到药店较少的红桥区来。从去年9月开业以来，营业慢慢好转，到去年11月已经稍有盈余了。在旧社会大鱼吃小鱼，你挤我，我挤你，像我们这样的小户被挤垮的可不少。我们能有今天的日子，只有感谢毛主席、共产党给我们安排的好。过去自己总认为自己被人称为资产阶级，挺苦恼。现在才认清了前途：只要努力学习，好好干，将来就能够成为工人阶级的一分子。”
    在估衣街第二棉布总店元隆门市部的售货员里，有几个过去是摆摊的小商贩，全行业合营被批准后，才被合并到这里来。他们在这里受到原来职工们的热情帮助。连开发票都由职工掰着手教。他们回忆过去在大街上摆摊的时候，夏天怕阴天下雨，货弄湿了就要赔本；冬天怕刮风下雪没有买主，至于将来的前途更不敢想，只是一天一天地混日子。现在参加合营企业，前途有望了。商贩吴冀陶说：“过去也知道社会主义好，可是总想自己没有路费（指资金），怕走不到社会主义。这回毛主席指示的全行业合营的办法真周到，不但考虑到大户，连我们这样一两个人的小商贩也照顾到了。从前过日子没有目的，现在毛主席把我们领到大路上，能不能走就在个人了。我们一定要听毛主席的话，毛主席指到哪，我们就走到哪。”
