Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 1st - TASS: Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman N.A. Bulganin's answers to questions posed by Stanka Veselinova, the editor of the Yugoslav newspaper "News Weekly."

Stanka Veselinova, the editor of the Yugoslav newspaper "News Weekly," wrote to Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman N.A. Bulganin, requesting him to answer some questions of interest to the Yugoslav public regarding the current international situation.

N.A. Bulganin answered the questions of Yugoslav newspaper "News Weekly" editor S. Veselinova as follows:

Q: How do you assess the diplomatic achievements of the past year and this year in terms of easing international tensions and developing international cooperation?

A: In the past year, thanks to the efforts of peaceful forces, important positive results have been achieved in easing international tensions and in developing mutual understanding and cooperation among countries for the sake of safeguarding and strengthening peace.

At the same time, it should be pointed out that the complete normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and the strengthening of the long-standing friendship between the Soviet and Yugoslav peoples are significant events for the cause of peace. The friendship between the Soviet and Yugoslav peoples was consolidated by the common struggle against the common enemy - the fascist aggressors.

It is also necessary to point out the satisfactory resolution of the Austrian issue, as well as the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.

The further strengthening of fraternal friendship and cooperation between countries like the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and other countries that have embarked on the path of socialist development, as well as the expansion of ties and the development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, Afghanistan and other countries, are powerful factors in further easing international tensions and developing international cooperation.

Special mention should be made of the historic event of the Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of the United Kingdom, France, the United States and the Soviet Union, which will remain in the memory of the people of all countries as an important milestone in the development of international relations along the road to consolidating peace.

The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung was also an important factor for peace. This conference sent out a resounding voice from the peoples of the two continents against the preparation of a new war, against colonialism, and for friendship and cooperation among the peoples of all countries.

In this year, the well-known principles of equal relations between countries, namely mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, have gained wide recognition.

These principles have become the basis of the foreign policy of an increasing number of countries, including Yugoslavia, the People's Republic of China, India, the Soviet Union, Burma and Afghanistan.

All this proves the unyielding desire of the people of all countries to get rid of the threat of a new war, to stop the arms race and to put an end to colonialism forever, and their willingness to establish a spirit of peaceful cooperation in international relations in solving outstanding international issues, regardless of their existing internal systems.

The admission of 16 countries, namely Albania, Jordan, Ireland, Portugal, Hungary, Italy, Austria, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, Ceylon, Nepal, Libya, Cambodia, Laos and Spain, to the United Nations is one of the positive results of the past year. This is a major victory for the policy of peaceful cooperation among countries and a failure for the "Cold War" policy. As everyone knows, this important decision of the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly was made on the initiative of the Soviet Union.

The mutual exchange of parliamentary delegations and reciprocal visits by national leaders between the Soviet Union and a number of countries, including the recent visits of Soviet national leaders to India, Burma and Afghanistan, are important contributions to the cause of consolidating peace and cooperation among the peoples of all countries. The meetings between the national leaders of the Soviet Union and these countries have further strengthened the foundation for the development of friendly relations between these countries and the Soviet Union, which is of great significance for the development of the entire international cooperation. All this will promote the further strengthening and development of international political, economic and cultural ties.

The Soviet Union has made every effort to develop good relations with all other countries and to strive for the settlement of outstanding international issues. However, as everyone knows, there has still been no major progress in resolving one of the most important international issues - the reduction of armaments and armed forces, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the establishment of effective international supervision over the implementation of these issues.

Unfortunately, Western countries have changed their position on this issue from before May 1955, and even abandoned their own proposals. The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference showed that they have, in fact, rejected their own claims on the reduction of armaments and armed forces, as well as the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Due to the policies pursued by these countries, the issue of guaranteeing European security and the German issue, which have been the subject of discussion at international conferences more than once, have not yet been resolved.

It is also impossible to ignore the fact that some people in the West who are dissatisfied with the "Geneva spirit" are trying to reverse the course of events and return to the previous "Cold War" path. They are increasingly stepping up the expansion of armaments and increasing spending on military preparations. For example, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council recently advocated arming the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's troops with nuclear weapons, accelerating the rearmament of West Germany, intensifying military preparations in the Near and Middle East, and increasing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's air force in Western Europe by one-third.

Under the fabricated pretext of preparing for "defense," these people are trying to continue to pursue their previous "position of strength" policy. However, this policy of placing the heavy burden of military spending on the shoulders of the people and aggravating the danger of a new war has been discredited. The people of all countries cannot bear the arms race, the heavy burden of taxes, the rising prices, and the threat of atomic war. Those in the West who have consistently advocated the "position of strength" policy must listen to the voices of the people. Because this policy not only fails to bring about a positive solution to international problems, but on the contrary, complicates the solution of these problems, intensifies international tensions, and deepens mistrust between countries.

Q: What do you think are the prospects for further consolidating peace and resolving major international issues?

A: The irresistible desire of the people of all countries to live in peace and friendship is a reliable guarantee that the new year of 1956 will be a year of further easing international tensions and consolidating peace. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to abandon and forget the "position of strength" policy. The temporary difficulties encountered in resolving certain issues at certain conferences cannot and should not weaken the determination of the people of all countries to oppose the threat of a new war and strive for the development of international cooperation.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my fraternal feelings of friendship to the Yugoslav people, which the Soviet people have always cherished in the past and now cherish, and at the same time, I sincerely congratulate the Yugoslav people on achieving further successes in socialist construction in the coming New Year.

　　满怀信心走向新的胜利
　　布尔加宁答南斯拉夫报纸记者问
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科1日电：苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁对南斯拉夫报纸“新闻周刊”社长斯坦卡·维谢利诺娃所提问题的答复。
    南斯拉夫报纸“新闻周刊”社长斯坦卡·维谢利诺娃致函苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁，请求他回答南斯拉夫公众所感兴趣的、有关当前国际形势的一些问题。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁回答南斯拉夫报纸“新闻周刊”社长斯·维谢利诺娃的问题如下：
    问：您如何估计过去一年的外交和这一年在缓和国际紧张局势和发展国际合作方面的结果？
    答：过去一年，由于和平力量的努力，在缓和国际紧张局势方面，在各国为维护和巩固和平利益而发展相互谅解和合作方面，取得了重要的积极成果。
    同时，应当指出像苏联和南斯拉夫关系完全正常化和苏南两国人民的悠久友谊的加强这一对和平事业有重大意义的事件，苏南两国人民的友谊是由反对共同敌人——法西斯掠夺者的共同斗争巩固起来的。
    还必须指出奥地利问题的圆满解决，以及苏联和德意志联邦共和国的外交关系的建立。
    苏联、中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫和其他走上了社会主义发展道路的国家的兄弟般友谊和合作的进一步加强，以及苏联同印度、缅甸、阿富汗和其他国家的联系的扩大和友好关系的发展，是进一步缓和国际紧张局势和发展国际合作的强有力的因素。
    特别应该指出像英、法、美、苏四国政府首脑日内瓦会议这一有历史意义的事件，这次会议将作为沿着巩固和平的道路发展国际关系的重要标志而留在各国人民的记忆中。
    在万隆举行的亚非会议也是和平的重要因素，这个会议发出了两洲人民反对准备新战争、反对殖民主义，争取各国人民之间的友谊和合作的响亮的声音。
    在这一年中，互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、不干涉他国的内政、平等互利和和平共处这几项著名的各国之间平等关系的原则获得了广泛的承认。
    这些原则成为越来越多的国家的外交政策的基础，这些国家包括南斯拉夫、中华人民共和国、印度、苏联、缅甸和阿富汗。
    这一切证明了各国人民不屈不挠地渴望摆脱新战争的威胁，停止扩充军备和永远结束殖民主义，并且愿意在国际关系中树立在解决悬而未决的国际问题上实行和平合作的精神，而不问它们现有的内部制度如何。
    阿尔巴尼亚、约旦、爱尔兰、葡萄牙、匈牙利、意大利、奥地利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、芬兰、锡兰、尼泊尔、利比亚、柬埔寨、老挝和西班牙16个国家被接纳加入联合国，是过去一年的积极成果之一。这是各国和平合作政策的重大胜利，“冷战”政策的失败。大家知道，安全理事会和联合国大会的这个重要的决定是根据苏联的主动而作出的。
    苏联和一些国家之间互派议会代表团和国家领导人的相互访问，包括苏联国家领导人不久前的访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗，是对巩固各国人民的和平和合作事业的重要贡献。苏联和这些国家的国家领导人的会晤，更加加强了发展这些国家和苏联之间的友好关系的基础，这对发展整个国际合作事业有巨大意义。所有这些都将促进国际间的政治、经济和文化联系的进一步加强和发展。
    苏联曾经竭尽全力来发展同其他一切国家的良好关系，争取解决悬而未决的国际问题。但是，大家知道，在解决最重要的国际问题之一——裁减军备和武装部队、禁止原子武器和氢武器并对这些问题的决定的执行建立有效的国际监督方面，仍然没有重大的进展。
    遗憾的是，西方国家在这一问题上改变了自己在1955年5月以前所持的立场，甚至放弃了自己提出的建议。日内瓦外交部长会议表明，它们事实上拒绝了自己对裁减军备和武装部队以及禁止原子武器和氢武器的主张。
    由于这些国家执行的政策，保障欧洲安全的问题和德国问题到现在还没有得到解决、这些问题曾经不止一次是国际会议的讨论对象。
    还不能忽视这一事实：西方某些不满意“日内瓦精神”的人士企图扭转事态的发展，使之回到以前的“冷战”道路上去。他们日益加紧扩充军备、增加军事准备的开支。例如，不久前北大西洋公约组织理事会曾经主张以核子武器武装北大西洋公约组织的军队，主张加速西德的重新武装和在中近东加紧军事准备，主张把北大西洋公约组织在西欧的空军增加三分之一。
    在准备“防御”的捏造借口下，这些人士企图继续执行以前的“实力地位”政策。但是，这种把军事开支重担放在人民肩上和使新战争危险加剧的政策已经名誉扫地。各国人民不能甘心忍受军备竞赛、税收重担、物价飞涨的生活以及原子战争的威胁。西方那些一贯拥护“实力地位”政策的人们必须倾听人民的呼声。因为这种政策不仅不能使国际问题得到积极的解决，而且相反地会使这些问题的解决复杂化，会使国际紧张局势加剧，会使国与国之间的不信任加深。
    问：您认为，进一步巩固和平和解决重大国际问题的前景如何？
    答：各国人民要求和平友好地相处的不可抑制的愿望，是使新的1956年成为进一步缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的一年的可靠保证。为了达到这一点，有必要抛弃和忘记“实力地位”政策。在某些会议上在解决某些问题方面遇到的一时的困难，不能够而且也不应当削弱各国人民反对新战争威胁、争取发展国际合作的决心。
    我愿乘这个机会最后向南斯拉夫人民表示兄弟友谊的感情，苏联人民过去和现在一直对南斯拉夫人民怀抱着这种感情，同时，我衷心地祝贺南斯拉夫人民在即将到来的新的一年中在社会主义建设方面获得进一步的成就。
