    Members of the Liaoyuan Collective Farm
    Actively Invest Their Savings in the Farm
    Xinhua News Agency:
    Members of the Liaoyuan Collective Farm in Yaobao Village, Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, recently invested a total of more than 7,300 yuan of their savings into the farm in order to develop the farm's production.
    The Liaoyuan Collective Farm was established at the end of last year by merging three elementary co-ops. 75% of the members were originally poor peasants and farm laborers. Due to the development of elementary co-op production in recent years, the vast majority of their lives have risen to the level of middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, and they have savings. Animal tender, Pang He, couldn't even afford a good cotton coat three years ago, but now he has more than 1,000 yuan in savings. This time he invested 520 yuan in the farm.

    燎原集体农庄庄员
    积极把自己的积蓄投入农庄
    黑龙江省呼兰县腰堡村燎原集体农庄的庄员，为了发展农庄的生产，最近把自己的积蓄共7，300多元投入了农庄。
    燎原集体农庄是去年年底由3个初级社合并建成的。75％的庄员原来都是贫农和雇农。由于几年来初级社生产的发展，他们绝大多数的生活都已经上升到中农和富裕中农的水平，并且有了积蓄。饲养员庞和3年前连好棉衣都穿不上，现在他有了1，000多元的积蓄。这次他就给农庄投了520元。　（新华社）
