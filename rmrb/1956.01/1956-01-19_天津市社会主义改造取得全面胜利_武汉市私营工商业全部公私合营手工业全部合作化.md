Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 18th: Today, Tianjin has completed its socialist transformation tasks ahead of schedule for the first Five-Year Plan and has begun to enter socialist society.
    The various economic components in Tianjin's national economy have undergone the following changes: In 1955, state-owned industry accounted for 54% of the city's total industrial output value, joint state-private industry accounted for 22.9%, and private industry accounted for 23.1%; now all these private industries have implemented joint state-private ownership. The original 226 private motor vehicle transport companies and 78 private motor vehicle repair factories in the transportation industry have also been approved by the government to be transformed into state-owned motor vehicle teams and repair shops respectively. In commerce, wholesale business has been completely controlled by the state-owned economy; in terms of total retail sales, state-owned and joint state-private commercial enterprises accounted for 49.54% last year, and private enterprises accounted for 50.46%. Now, all these private retailers, except for the grain industry which directly transitioned to state-owned stores of a socialist nature, have implemented joint state-private ownership.
    The cooperative movement of Tianjin's handicraft industry, agriculture, and fishery has also developed very rapidly. All of the more than 83,000 handicraftsmen have joined handicraft cooperatives, and 90.56% of the farmers in the suburbs have joined advanced cooperatives, and more than 90% of marine fishermen have also joined cooperatives. In this way, the scattered individual economy in Tianjin's national economy has become a socialist cooperative economy.

    武汉市私营工商业全部公私合营手工业全部合作化
    据新华社天津18日电　今天，天津市已经提前完成了第一个五年计划的社会主义改造任务，开始进入了社会主义社会。
    现在，天津市国民经济中的各种经济成份发生了如下变化：1955年全市工业总产值中，国营工业占54％，公私合营工业占22.9％，私营工业占23.1％；现在这些私营工业已经全部实行公私合营了。交通运输业中原有的226户私营汽车运输行和78户私营汽车修理厂，也经政府批准分别改为国营汽车队和修理场。在商业中，批发业务已经完全由国营经济掌握；在零售总额方面，去年国营和公私合营商业占49.54％，私营占50.46％，现在这些私营零售商除粮食业直接过渡到社会主义性质的国营门市部外，其余的全部实行了公私合营。
    天津市手工业、农业、渔业的合作化运动的发展也十分迅速。83，000多个手工业者已经全部参加了手工业合作社，郊区农户加入高级社的已经达到郊区农户总数的90.56％，海洋渔民入社户数也达到了90％以上。这样，天津市国民经济中分散的个体经济已经成为社会主义的合作经济了。
    据新华社天津18日电　天津市文化局今天批准全市112户私营电影院、剧场和书场、茶社全行业转为国营文化企业。天津市影剧场公司也同时成立。
