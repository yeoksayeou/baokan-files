Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 16th: Shanghai will have 20,000 cadres participating in the work of converting all private industrial and commercial enterprises into joint state-private ownership. These cadres are drawn from the Party and government organs and mass organizations in Shanghai. They will be gathered in the next day or two to participate in the work of the industry-specific joint state-private ownership work committees or to form joint state-private ownership work groups. On the afternoon of January 16th, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a cadre meeting of more than 13,000 people. Cao Diqiu, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee, gave a mobilization report, saying: The transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in Shanghai is about to reach its climax. Industrialists, businessmen, and the broad masses of workers unanimously demand that all private industrial and commercial enterprises be converted into joint state-private ownership as soon as possible. At the temporary representative meeting of industrialists and businessmen held yesterday, a resolution was made to complete all applications for joint state-private ownership before the 20th. The Municipal Committee believes that it is fully possible to accelerate the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in Shanghai and to complete the conversion of all private industrial and commercial enterprises into joint state-private ownership before the 20th.

    Cao Diqiu mentioned that agriculture in the suburbs of Shanghai will complete complete socialist cooperativization in the next few days, and handicrafts will also complete cooperativization before the 20th. Shanghai will learn from the example of the capital and will soon enter a socialist society. At this time, the whole audience immediately burst into thunderous applause.

    Next, Cao Diqiu explained in detail the various policies and work steps in the implementation of joint state-private ownership for all private industrial and commercial enterprises. He emphasized that Shanghai is the city with the highest concentration of capitalist industry and commerce in our country, and completing the conversion of all private industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai into joint state-private ownership is an extremely arduous and historically significant task. He called on everyone to go all out to complete this task quickly and well.

This newspaper, Shanghai, January 15th: The Shanghai private industrial and commercial circles have decided to learn from the industrial and commercial circles in Beijing, accelerate the socialist transformation, and strive to complete the application work for joint state-private ownership of all private industrial and commercial enterprises in the city before the 20th of this month. This is the resolution passed by the temporary representative meeting of the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles held today.

    The news that all capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing have implemented joint state-private ownership has greatly encouraged the vast number of industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai. In recent days, the number of industries and households applying for joint state-private ownership has surged, and they have requested the government to approve the implementation of joint state-private ownership as soon as possible.

    Mass organizations such as workers, peasants, women, and youth in Shanghai sent representatives to participate in today's meeting of industrial and commercial circles to express their support for the patriotic enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen. Liu Shuzhou, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, also spoke at the meeting. Finally, the meeting also passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 16th: The Shanghai Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association held a temporary members' meeting tonight, deciding to organize more than 3,000 activists from the industrial and commercial circles, with members in the industrial and commercial circles as the backbone, to devote themselves to the current work of converting all private industrial and commercial enterprises in the city into joint state-private ownership.

    上海市在最近几天内即将完成社会主义改造任务
    新华社上海16日电　上海将有两万名干部参加私营工商业全部实行公私合营的工作。这些干部是从上海市的党政机关和各群众团体中抽调出来的。他们将在今明两天内分别集中，参加各行业公私合营工作委员会进行工作或组成公私合营工作组。16日下午，中共上海市委员会召开了13，000多人参加的干部大会，市委副书记曹荻秋作了动员报告，他说：上海资本主义工商业的改造即将达到最高潮，工商界和广大职工一致要求私营工商业全部早日实行公私合营，昨天举行的工商界临时代表会上，已经作出在20日前完成全部申请公私合营的决议。市委认为，加快上海资本主义工商业改造的速度，在20日前全部私营工商业完成公私合营已经具备充分条件。
    曹荻秋讲到上海郊区的农业将在最近几天内完成完全社会主义合作化，手工业也将在20日前全部完成合作化。上海将学习首都的榜样，不久就要进入社会主义社会。这时全场立刻响起暴风雨般的掌声。
    接着，曹荻秋详细交代了全部私营工商业实行公私合营中的各项政策和工作步骤。他强调指出，上海是我国资本主义工商业最集中的城市，完成上海私营工商业的全部公私合营，是一项极其繁重和具有历史意义的任务，他号召大家全力以赴，把这项任务完成得又快又好。
    本报上海15日电　上海市私营工商业界决定向北京市工商业界学习，加速进行社会主义改造，争取在本月20日以前完成全市私营工商业公私合营的申请工作。这是今天召开的上海市工商界临时代表会议所通过的决议。

    上海市工人、农民、妇女、青年等群众组织都派代表参加了今天工商界的会议，对工商界人士这种爱国热情表示支持。上海市副市长刘述周也在会上讲了话。最后会议还通过了给毛主席的致敬电。
