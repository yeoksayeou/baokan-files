    A Number of Small Rural Hydropower Stations Completed in Jilin
    Jilin Province has completed 13 small rural hydropower stations. The total power generation of these small hydropower stations is 1,500 kilowatts, which can supply electricity for lighting to 2,340 households in 14 nearby villages. It has also created favorable conditions for local farmers to develop agricultural and sideline production. The electricity from a small hydropower station in Luozigou Township, Wangqing County, can regularly supply local farmers with power for rice milling, flour milling, cotton ginning, and wood processing. After these hydropower stations generated electricity, local farmers became even more enthusiastic about attending night school to study culture. Farmers near the hydropower stations can also watch movies regularly, hold entertainment evenings, and listen to broadcasts from the county broadcasting station.

    吉林建成一批农村小型水电站
    吉林省已经建成13座农村小型水力发电站。这些小型水电站的总发电量为1，500瓩，可以供附近14个村2，340户照明使用，并且为当地农民发展农、副业生产创造了有利条件，汪清县罗子沟乡的一座小型水力发电站的电力，就能供给当地农民经常碾米、磨面、弹棉花和制木材等使用。这些水电站发电以后，当地农民上夜校学习文化的劲头也更大了。水电站附近的农民还能够常看电影，举办文娱晚会和收听县广播站的广播。（若建）
