    It is Necessary to Care About the Lives of the Workers and Masses
    By Our Reporter Jin Yukun

    To accelerate socialist industrial construction depends on the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers in building socialism. Improving the material and cultural lives of the masses is an important condition for enhancing this enthusiasm.

    The Party and the government have always been concerned about improving the lives of workers. In recent years, with the recovery and development of the national economy, both the wage income and indirect income of workers have increased. According to statistics from all state-owned and local state-owned enterprises in Shenyang, labor productivity in 1954 increased by 16.1% compared to 1952, and the average wage of workers increased by 13.6% during the same period. State appropriations for workers' welfare undertakings have also increased. The city now has 65 sanatoriums, 50 spare-time sanatoriums, 485 nurseries, and 189 health clinics. A large number of workers' dormitories, clubs, and schools for their children have also been built.

    However, while the overall trend of workers' lives is constantly improving, a very serious tendency to disregard the lives of workers has grown in many enterprises, and many problems that should and could be solved have not been resolved in a timely manner. The labor productivity of some enterprises has increased significantly year by year, but the average wage of workers has decreased year by year, and the wage funds allocated by the state to enterprises, which should be fully distributed to workers, have a large surplus.

    The direct causes of the large surplus of wage funds and the decrease in average wages are roughly three: First, the scope of piece-rate wages has been reduced. According to statistics from 51 factories in Shenyang, only 22% of workers were paid piece-rate wages in the first half of 1955. Second, many workers fail to meet their quotas. In two workshops of the Shenyang Woolen Mill, 84% of workers failed to meet their quotas in a three-month period. The reason workers fail to meet their quotas is not because the current quotas are too high, but because of chaotic enterprise management and serious phenomena such as waiting for materials and waiting for tools. The leadership does not take corresponding technical and organizational measures to guarantee and help workers meet their quotas. Some enterprises change quotas too quickly, sometimes three times in a month. This erroneous practice further causes a considerable number of workers to fail to meet their quotas. Third, some workers have not been promoted for a long time. In some factories, more than half of the workers have not been promoted for three or four years. Individual units allow apprentices to do the work of technicians but restrict apprentices from being promoted to technicians. An apprentice in a factory in Shenyang took 12 promotion exams in two and a half years without being promoted, even though he had long been replacing technicians in the workshop. Some economic leading organs subjectively stipulate percentage restrictions on promotions, rather than based on the actual situation of workers' improved technical level and the needs of production development. The poor performance of promotion work has created an unreasonable phenomenon in which the wage grade of some workers is lower than their actual technical level.

    Wages are the main income of workers. The reason why there are so many shortcomings in wage work is mainly that the leaders of some enterprises have adopted a passive and irresponsible attitude towards this major issue. They mistakenly believe that wage issues are "hornets' nests that cannot be provoked," that "one branch does not move, and a hundred branches do not shake," that "fewer actions mean fewer opinions, and more actions mean more opinions," so they try to deal with them as vaguely as possible.

    Some enterprises have also failed to do a good job in providing subsidies and relief to workers with difficult lives and in developing collective welfare undertakings for workers. In reality, some workers have very difficult lives, while at the same time there is a large surplus of worker hardship relief funds. According to statistics from 14 enterprises in Shenyang, 65% of the 5% hardship relief funds in the enterprise bonus fund were saved from January to August last year; 59% of the 20% hardship subsidies in trade union membership dues were saved. In welfare undertakings, the implementation of enterprise or semi-enterprise management without improved management has also increased the living burden of workers. After the Shenyang Transformer Factory canteen implemented enterprise management, food prices rose by 27%, and prices in general factories rose by about 10% to 20%. Some factory canteens even deliberately raise food prices to make profits. The Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory canteen made a profit of more than 10,000 yuan in four months.

    The basic reason why the above situation has not improved for a long time is that in recent years, bureaucratic work styles that disregard the suffering of the masses of workers have grown in some leading organs and enterprises. Some people think that economic work is now very heavy and that they "do not have time" to deal with these problems. Some people think that our Party's fine tradition of caring about the lives of the masses is outdated and are becoming increasingly estranged from the lives of the masses. Some leading organs do not understand the actual living conditions of workers for a long time. They only inspect production work and labor competitions but do not inspect the living problems of workers. Sometimes, they even express "doubt" when problems are reported from below. The Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions investigated 19 factories and found no leading personnel who regularly visited workers' dormitories.

    Trade unions are the organizations of the working masses themselves, and caring about the lives of workers is the trade unions' unshirkable responsibility. However, the lack of concern for workers' suffering is a very common phenomenon in trade union organizations. Many trade union cadres confuse caring about the lives of the masses with "economism." They mistakenly believe that caring about the lives of the masses is "economism" and are afraid of being labeled with the "economism" hat, so they dare not ask about issues related to the lives of the masses. They do not understand that it is wrong to solve living problems in isolation from the development of production; however, neglecting the possible and necessary improvement of workers' lives is also a serious mistake. If this situation is not changed, these trade union organizations will become seriously detached from the masses.

    Some enterprises have distorted the principle of thrift. They have included the wages that workers should receive in the items of the thrift plan. The Fushun Longfeng Mine planned to save 1.5 million yuan last year, of which the figure for saving wages reached 210,000 yuan. The state's wage plan specifically embodies the wage policy of distribution according to work and grows proportionally with the development of production. Therefore, the indicators for improving living standards in the state's wage plan must be completed. However, some enterprises, on the contrary, regard the failure to complete the labor wage plan and the large surplus of wage funds as "achievements." The Shenyang Chemical Plant called this situation "overfulfilling the task." The absurdity of this thinking is truly astonishing.

    Today, when there is an urgent demand to accelerate the speed of industrialization, the issue of caring about the suffering of workers should be placed in an important position. Economic organs, enterprise administrations, and trade unions should regard the living problems of workers as one of the important daily work tasks. Enterprise Party organizations should regularly check and supervise this work, and major issues related to the lives of workers should be discussed at Party meetings. If this shortcoming of not caring about the lives of the masses of workers is not promptly and seriously corrected, it will dampen the enthusiasm of the masses in building socialism and endanger our socialist construction cause. The intangible losses it causes will be incalculable.

### 必须关心职工群众的生活

    必须关心职工群众的生活
    本报记者　金雨困
    要加速社会主义工业建设，决定于广大职工群众建设社会主义的积极性。而改善群众的物质和文化生活，正是提高群众这种积极性的重要条件之一。
    党和政府一直是关怀职工生活的改善的。几年来，随着国民经济的恢复和发展，职工的工资收入和间接收入都有了增长。据沈阳市全部国营企业和地方国营企业统计，1954年比1952年劳动生产率提高了16.1％，同一时期职工的平均工资增长了13.6％。国家用于职工福利事业的拨款也有增加。现在全市已经有疗养所65个，业余疗养所50个，托儿所485个，卫生所189个。并且建筑了大量的工人宿舍、俱乐部和子弟学校。
    但是，在职工生活总的趋势不断提高的情况下，在不少企业中滋长了一种十分严重的漠视职工生活的倾向，许多应该解决、可以解决的问题没有得到及时的解决。有些企业的劳动生产率逐年提高了很多，而职工的平均工资却逐年下降，国家拨给企业的应该全部发给职工的工资基金，大量剩余下来。
    促成工资基金大量结余、平均工资下降的直接原因，大致有这样三个：第一是计件工资面缩小。据沈阳市51个工厂的统计，1955年上半年实行计件工资的工人只有22％。第二是很多工人达不到定额。沈阳毛织厂有两个车间，在3个月当中有84％的工人达不到定额。工人达不到定额，并不是因为现行的定额太高了，而是由于企业管理混乱，待料、待工具等现象严重，领导方面又不采取相应的技术组织措施来保证和帮助工人达到定额。有的企业定额变得过快，有一个月变3次的。这种错误的做法就更加促使相当大数量的工人不能达到定额。第三是有些工人长期没有升级。有的工厂有一半以上的工人三、四年没有升级。个别单位让徒工做技工活，却限制徒工升为技工。沈阳某工厂有个徒工，入厂二年半，考了12次没有升级，实际上他在车间里早已顶替技工干活。有些经济领导机关，不是根据职工技术水平提高的实际情况和生产发展的需要，而是主观地规定限制升级的百分比。升级工作做得不好，就造成了某些工人的工资等级低于实际技术水平的不合理现象。
    工资是职工的主要收入。工资工作中所以有这许多缺点，主要是某些企业的领导人员对待这一重大问题采取了消极的不负责任的态度。他们错误地认为，工资问题是“惹不得碰不得”的“马蜂窝”，“一枝不动，百枝不摇”，“少动几个意见少，多动几个意见多”，尽可能不了了之。
    有些企业对生活困难的职工的补助救济工作和职工的集体福利事业也没有做好。实际上有些职工的生活很困难，而同时职工困难救济金又有大量结余。据沈阳市14个企业的统计，企业奖励基金中5％的困难救济金，去年1至8月共节余65％；工会会费中有20％的困难补助费，结余了59％。在福利事业中，由于实行企业化、半企业化后，管理工作没有改善，也增加了职工的生活负担。沈阳变压器厂的食堂实行企业化后，饭菜价格上涨27％，一般的工厂都上涨10％到20％左右。有的工厂食堂甚至故意提高饭菜价格以谋取利润。沈阳低压开关厂的食堂，4个月就获利一万多元。
    上述情况长期得不到改善，基本原因是近几年来在某些领导机关和企业中，滋长了漠视职工群众生活疾苦的官僚主义作风。有的人认为现在经济工作很繁重，“没有时间”去管这些问题。有的人认为我们党关心群众生活的优良传统，是过了时的东西，从而同群众的生活日渐疏远起来。有些领导机关长期不了解工人的实际生活情况，他们只检查生产工作和劳动竞赛，而不检查工人的生活问题。甚至有时下面把问题反映上去，他们还表示“怀疑”。沈阳市工会联合会调查了19个工厂，没有发现一个领导人员经常到工人宿舍去访问。
    工会是职工群众自己的组织，关心职工生活原是工会的义不容辞的责任。但是目前不关心职工疾苦是工会组织中很普遍的现象。不少工会干部把关心群众生活和“经济主义”混同起来，他们错误地认为关心群众生活就是“经济主义”，怕戴上“经济主义”的帽子，不敢去过问有关群众生活的问题。他们不了解，离开了生产的发展，孤立地去解决生活问题，是错误的；但是，忽视职工生活的可能和必要的改善，同样是严重的错误。这种状况不改变，这些工会组织就会严重地脱离群众。
    有些企业曲解了节约的原则。他们把工人应得的工资也列入了节约计划的项目之内。抚顺龙凤矿去年计划节约150万元，其中节约工资的数字就达21万元。国家的工资计划是具体地体现按劳付酬的工资政策的，是随着生产的发展按比例增长的。因此国家工资计划中提高生活的指标必须完成。但是有些企业相反地把完不成劳动工资计划、工资基金大量结余，视为“成绩”。沈阳化工厂就对这种情况称之为“超额完成了任务”。这种思想的荒谬，实在是惊人的。
    在迫切要求加快工业化速度的今天，应该把关心职工生活疾苦的问题放到重要的位置上来。经济机关、企业行政和工会，应该把职工的生活问题当作日常的重要工作任务之一。企业党组织应该经常检查和督促这项工作，有关职工生活的重大问题，应该在党的会议上讨论。这种不关心职工群众生活的缺点，如果不迅速地认真地加以纠正，就将挫伤群众建设社会主义的热情，危害我们的社会主义建设事业。它所造成的无形的损失，将是难以估计的。
