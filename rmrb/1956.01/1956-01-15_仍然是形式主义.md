    Still Formalism
    When the designers of the Design Department of the Harbin Construction Engineering Bureau designed the main building of the Harbin China-Soviet Friendship Museum two years ago, they made a formalistic mistake by designing a large roof, and were criticized. After accepting the "lessons learned," they decided to use flat roofs when they designed two three-story buildings last autumn. But unfortunately, they did not carefully consider the technical level of construction and the source of materials beforehand. As a result, after the reinforced concrete floor slab on the flat roof was completed, they discovered that the fly ash and filter oil, which were indispensable for building a flat roof, could not be bought, and could not be replaced by other materials. In this way, they had to re-erect a gable frame on the flat roof. In total, nearly 30,000 yuan was wasted.
    Not based on the actual situation, not based on objective and subjective conditions, starting purely from form, opposing all pitched roofs for the sake of opposing large roofs, will ultimately still fall into the quagmire of formalism, wasting the country's valuable funds for nothing.

    仍然是形式主义
    哈尔滨建筑工程局设计处的设计者们，前年设计哈尔滨中苏友谊馆的主楼的时候，犯了形式主义的错误，设计大屋顶，受到了批评。接受“经验教训”后，去年秋天他们设计两栋三层楼房的时候，决心要采用平屋顶。但是可惜，他们事前没有周密地考虑施工的技术水平和材料来源，结果当平屋顶上的钢筋混凝土楼板已经打完了，才发现修盖平屋顶所不可少的烟灰和滤油根本买不到，又不能用其他材料代替。这样一来，只好在平屋顶上重新架起人字房架来。总计前前后后一共浪费了将近30，000元。
    不根据实际情况，不根据主客观条件，单纯从形式出发，为反对大屋顶而反对一切起脊屋顶，最后仍然要陷在形式主义的泥坑中，白白糟踏了国家宝贵的资金。
