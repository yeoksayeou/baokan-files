    To the Editor:

    In September 1955, I attended the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism. Comrade Li Chunlin, a youth press operator from the State-owned Tianjin Bicycle Factory, introduced the material-saving practices of their section at the conference, which greatly inspired me. I thought: a bicycle weighs less than 30 catties, and they can save more than 100 tons of steel in a year. The freight cars we repair weigh dozens of tons each, and some parts are heavier than a bicycle. Why do we save so little material?

    After returning to my job, I introduced the steel-saving experience of Li Chunlin's section to our work area. After discussion, everyone examined the shortcomings of focusing only on completing tasks while neglecting conservation in the past. We also realized that our production preparation team is the first process in the entire workshop, and the potential for saving materials is enormous. After inspection, we proposed the conservation policy of "Use old before new, use superior materials before inferior, use large materials before small," and the team also proposed a system of reviewing vehicle repair orders and strengthening contact with inspection personnel to prevent waste. At the same time, we formulated individual and team conservation plans to launch a competition. Through collective research, our work area made a pattern for the guard's van components, so there were specifications for cutting materials. I also manufactured a straightening tool, which not only saves manpower for cutting materials but also ensures the quality of the cutting. From the beginning of October 1955 to the end of the year, the entire work area saved more than 130 tons of steel, worth more than 63,000 yuan.

    In the future, while ensuring the quality of vehicle repairs, we will strive to save more steel for the country.

### 为国家节约更多的钢铁

    为国家节约更多的钢铁编辑同志：
    1955年9月，我出席了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。国营天津自行车厂青年压材工段李春林同志在大会上介绍了他们工段节约材料的情况，给我很大的启示。我想：一辆自行车不到30斤重，他们在一年里就能节约了一百多吨钢材；我们修理的货车一辆就是几十吨，有的零件就比一辆自行车重，可是为什么节约的材料很少呢？
    回到工作岗位以后，我把李春林工段节约钢材的经验在工区里作了介绍。经过讨论，大家检查了过去只顾赶任务、忽略节约的缺点；并且认识了我们生产准备领工区是全车间的第一道工序，节省材料的潜力是很大的。经过检查，我们提出“有旧不用新，优材不劣用，大材不小用”的节约方针，小组里还提出了审查车辆检修定单和加强同检验人员联系的制度来防止浪费，同时制定了个人和小组的节约计划来展开竞赛。经过集体研究，我们工区制成了守车下料样板，裁剪材料就有了规格；我还制造了调直铁卡工具，不但可以节省剪料的人力，还可以保证下料的质量。从1955年10月初到年底，全工区共节约了130多吨钢铁，价值63，000多元。
    今后我们在保证车辆修理质量的条件下，还要争取为国家节约更多的钢铁。
