　　My Experiences in the United States
　　Qian Xuesen
　　On December 16, 1955, the US State Department spokesman, Mr. White, issued a statement saying that the statement made by the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 16, 1955, regarding the issue of overseas Chinese in both countries was unfounded and that the US government had earnestly implemented the agreement reached at the Sino-US ambassadorial talks in Geneva. The US government puts on a solemn face to peace-loving people all over the world, trying to make people believe that it is the only good person, a gentleman. This reminds me of an old saying: "Mouth full of benevolence and morality, a belly full of male thieves and female prostitutes." Now let me annotate this sentence with my personal experience.
　　I went to the United States in 1935 to study. At that time, because the Chiang Kai-shek clique was in power in China, I stayed in the United States and engaged in research and teaching work after graduation. In 1949, China was liberated, and I wanted to return to China very much. In the summer of 1950, I prepared to leave the United States and take a Canadian Pacific Airlines plane to Hong Kong via Canada, and then transfer from Hong Kong back to the motherland. Over the years, I have accumulated many books and periodicals, which were packed by the transportation company and shipped to Hong Kong by ship. However, the US intelligence agencies learned of my preparations to return to China. First, the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued an order saying that I was not allowed to leave the US border. If I left the country privately, I would be fined or imprisoned, or fined and imprisoned. This was at the end of August 1950. Naturally, I could not leave the United States. But just as I was busy refunding my plane ticket and retrieving my luggage and books, the US customs detained all my luggage and books, saying that there were confidential documents, telegram codes, weapon drawings, and photos of jet engines inside. However, this was not enough to satisfy the US government. A few days later, in early September, the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued another order, saying that I was a member of the American Communist Party, so I should be deported according to "law." In order to prepare for my deportation, I was locked up in the Immigration and Naturalization Service's prison-like detention center. This is truly using all kinds of despicable means, sometimes not allowing me to leave the country, and sometimes deporting me, actually using this as an excuse to detain me unreasonably. Even fair-minded Americans disapprove of such arbitrary human rights violations by the US government. Several righteous colleagues at the school where I worked helped me to get bail. However, the bail was 15,000 US dollars, which is much more than the one or two thousand ransom demanded by ordinary thieves. I can really be "proud" of that; naturally, I could not afford such a large sum of money, and the bail was paid by American friends. I was locked up for a total of 15 days. While locked up, I was not allowed to talk to others. Every ten minutes at night, someone would open the door and turn on the lights to see if I had escaped. Such a life is not a normal life, but a kind of persecution and abuse, so I lost 30 pounds in 15 days!
　　I was released, but the matter was not over. There were many "interrogations" in a row, mainly asking about my relationship with many other people, trying to prove that I was a member of the American Communist Party. But it is not easy to fabricate something out of nothing. I was not originally a member of the American Communist Party. It is bound to be far-fetched to insist that I was. Even the American friends who were listening in, and even a reporter from an American newspaper, said that in the interrogation process, the person being interrogated was the one who was confident and justified, not the interrogator. I remember very clearly that when the people from the Immigration and Naturalization Service asked me what country I was loyal to, I said that I was loyal to the Chinese people, so I was loyal to the government that was beneficial to the Chinese people, and I was hostile to any government that was harmful to the Chinese people. He then asked again, then you don't let the government decide who you should be loyal to? My answer was: Who I am loyal to is for me to decide. At this point, he showed a victorious smile, seeming very satisfied that he had proven that I was an incorrigible "rebel." A rebel must be a communist! At that time, I really wanted to ask him, didn't your Lincoln say that your government must be a government that conforms to the will of the people? Have you forgotten?
　　Naturally, in addition to interrogation, the agents of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation were watching me, seeing what friends came to my house and who I went to visit, and what letters I had. Because of these things, I didn't go out often and lived a lonely life. In fact, there was nowhere to go, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service restricted my range of activities to Los Angeles County, where I lived. In this way, several years passed, one order prohibited me from leaving the United States, and another order ordered me to be deported. My books were detained for two years and "inspected" for more than two years. It was not until 1953 that they had to admit that they could not find any confidential documents. The telegram codes, weapon drawings, photos of jet engines, etc., that were said two years ago, all proved to be nonsense. So they finally had to return my books, which also proved that the actions taken by the US government two years ago were an unfounded slanderous persecution.
　　Of course, the US government has always publicized in domestic and international newspapers that they have not detained any Chinese overseas Chinese. But it was not until August 4, 1955, that I received a notice from the Immigration and Naturalization Service saying that the previous ban on leaving the country had been lifted and that I could leave the United States. The notice did not mention the deportation matter again. Why did they prohibit me from leaving the country in the first place, and why did they lift the ban now? This was not explained either. In fact, this mystery is not difficult to guess. August 4th was the fourth day of the Sino-US ambassadorial talks in Geneva, and it is impossible for the US government to handle a matter well in three days unless it is a matter of "extreme urgency." We can imagine that when Ambassador Wang Bingnan raised the issue of Chinese overseas Chinese with evidence at the Geneva, the United States was as panicked and anxious as a "fox spirit revealed its true form"!
　　Of course, I will not forget that there are many righteous people among the American people who gave me a lot of support during the five years I was detained in the United States. They and the peace-loving people of the United States are different from the US government; the actions of the US government are not their actions. The Chinese people have no ill feelings towards the American people. The Chinese people hope to be friends with the American people and live together peacefully.

### 我在美国的遭遇

　　我在美国的遭遇
    钱学森
    在1955年12月16日美国国务院发言人怀特发表声明说，我国外交部发言人在1955年12月16日关于两国侨民问题的声明是没有根据的，并说美国政府认真地执行了日内瓦中美两国大使级会谈的协议。美国政府对全世界爱好和平的人民装出一副一本正经的面孔，想使人相信只有它是好人、是君子。这使我想起一句老话：满嘴里仁义道德，一肚子男盗女娼。现在让我用我个人的亲身经历来对这句话作个注解。
    我是在1935年出国赴美求学的，当时因为蒋介石集团在国内当道，我一直留在美国，毕业后从事于研究和教学工作。1949年中国解放了，我就很想回国，1950年夏间，我准备离开美国，由加拿大乘加拿大太平洋公司的飞机到香港，再由香港转归祖国。我历年来积聚了许多书籍及期刊，这些由运输公司代为装箱由船运香港。但是美国的特务机关知道了我的归国准备，首先由移民及归化局给我来了一个命令说，不许我离开美国国境，如果私自出境，抓到了就要罚款或监禁、或罚款而又监禁。这是1950年8月底的事。我自然是不能离开美国了。但是正在我忙着退飞机票，追回我的行李书籍的时候，美国的海关把我的行李和书籍一概扣留，说是里面有机密文件，有电报密码，有武器的图纸，有喷射动力机的照片。然而这还不能令美国政府满意，又过了几天，在九月初，美国移民及归化局的命令又来了，这次说我是美国共产党员，所以依“法”应当把我驱逐出境，为了准备驱逐我出境，把我关在移民及归化局的像监牢样的看守所。这真是什么卑鄙的手段都用出来了，一会儿不许我离境，一会儿又要驱逐出境，实际上是以此为借口来把我无理拘禁。美国政府的这种随意侵犯人权的措施就连公正的美国人也不以为然，在我所工作的学校里就有几个有正义感的同事，还是由于他们的努力我才算得到交保释放。但是保金是15，000美金，比起一般盗贼绑票所要的一两千赎金来，那我真是可以“自豪”的了；自然我是拿不出这样大一笔钱的，保金也由美国友人们代交了。我一共被关了15天，关在里面的时候，不许和别人说话，晚上每十分钟又有人开门扭开电灯看一看我有没有逃走，这样的生活不是正常的生活，而是一种迫害和虐待，所以15天中我失去了30磅！
    放是放出来了，但事情可没有完，一连有多次的“审问”，主要的是问我和其他许多人的关系，无非想证明我是美国的共产党员。但是无中生有不是容易的事，我本来不是美国的共产党员，一定要说我是的自然是不免强词夺理，旁听的美国友人们，甚至一个美国报纸的记者都说：在审问过程中，理直气壮的，不是审问者而是被审问的人。我记得特别清楚的是当移民及归化局的人问我忠心于什么国家，我说我忠心于中国人民，所以我忠心于对中国人民有好处的政府，也就敌视对中国人民有害的任何政府。他就又问，那末你就不让政府来决定你所应当忠心的对象吗？我的回答是：我忠心于谁是要我自己来决定的。说到这里，他面上现出胜利的微笑，似乎很满意于已经证明我是不可救药的“反民”了，反民必是共产党！当时我很想问问他，你们的林肯不是说过你们的政府必须是合乎人民意志的政府吗？你忘了吗？
    自然除了审问之外，美国联邦调查局的特务是守着我的，看看有什么友人们来我家里，我又去访什么人，我有什么信。因为这些事，我也就不常出去，过着孤独的生活。其实出去也无处去，移民及归化局限制我的行动范围为我所住的洛山矶乡。就这样地过了几年，一个命令不许我离美国国境，而一个命令要驱逐我出境。我的书籍一直被扣了两年，“检查”了两年多，到1953年才不得不承认检查不出任何机密文件。两年前所说的电报密码，武器图纸，喷射动力机的照片等等都证明不过是一派胡言，所以他们终于不得不把我的书籍发回，这也就证明了，两年以前，美国政府所采取的行动是一种毫无根据的诬控的迫害行为。
    当然美国政府一向是在国内及国际报纸上宣传他们毫无拘留中国侨民的事的。但是一直到1955年8月4日我才收到移民及归化局的通知说，以前的禁止出境令取消了，我可以离开美国了，在通知中也没有再提起驱逐出境的事。当初为什么要禁止我出境，现在为什么又解除禁令呢？这也没有说明。其实这个谜是不难猜的，八月四日正是日内瓦中美两国大使级会谈开始的第四天，而在美国政府中要在三天之内办好一件事，除非是“十万火急”的事是不可能的。我们可以想像得到王炳南大使在日内瓦提出有证有据的中国侨民问题的时候，美国是正如“狐狸精现形”一样地惶恐、一样地着急！
    当然我也不会忘了在美国人民中有不少有正义感的人，在我被拘留在美国的五年中给了我不少支援，他们和美国爱好和平的人民是和美国政府不同的；美国政府的行动不是他们的行动。中国人民对美国人民是没有恶感的，中国人民希望能同美国人民作朋友而和平共处。
