Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting on the issue of intellectuals from January 14th to 20th. Participants included members and alternate members of the CPC Central Committee, secretaries or deputy secretaries of the CPC Central Committee's Shanghai Bureau, Beijing Municipal Committee, Tianjin Municipal Committee, Shanghai Municipal Committee, various Provincial Committees, various Autonomous Region Committees, and municipal committees of 26 municipalities under provincial jurisdiction, heads of various ministries and commissions of the CPC Central Committee, responsible party members of various departments of central state organs, responsible party members of various national mass organizations, and responsible party members of important national universities, scientific research institutions, factories, mines, design institutes, hospitals, art troupes, and military organs, totaling 1,279 people.

At the meeting, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a report on the issue of intellectuals. Comrade Liao Luyan, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, gave an explanation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956 to 1967.

The meeting held lively discussions from the 16th to the 20th. 61 people spoke at the general meeting (another 29 people were unable to speak at the general meeting due to time constraints, and their speeches were distributed in written form). Speakers unanimously agreed with Comrade Zhou Enlai's report and analyzed and explained the current situation of intellectuals and the implementation of the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and reforming intellectuals in various departments and localities. Speakers unanimously believed that the role of intellectuals is becoming increasingly important in the rapidly developing socialist construction cause, and the existing strength of intellectuals is far from meeting current needs. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over intellectuals, fully mobilize and utilize their existing strength, help them further conduct self-reform, and rapidly expand the ranks of intellectuals and improve their professional level. Speakers explained from various aspects the great achievements the Party has made in uniting, educating, and reforming intellectuals, while also exposing many shortcomings and errors in the current work. Speakers put forward many important suggestions on how to improve the use and arrangement of intellectuals, give them trust and support, how to improve the working conditions and treatment of intellectuals, how to help intellectuals further conduct self-reform, and how to rapidly develop China's scientific and cultural undertakings, systematically improve the professional level of intellectuals and expand the ranks of intellectuals in the near future.

The meeting also discussed the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) and Comrade Liao Luyan's explanation.

On the last day of the meeting, Comrade Mao Zedong spoke. He called on the whole Party to strive to learn scientific knowledge, unite with non-Party intellectuals, and strive to quickly catch up with the advanced world scientific level.
