　　Broaden Horizons, Study Hard, Master Your Own Destiny
    Shèng Pīhuá, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce
    1956 is the fourth year of the First Five-Year Plan. The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state has also entered a new stage of development. Under the great call of Chairman Mao, the vast number of private industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai have seen the future clearly and enhanced their confidence and strength in accepting socialist transformation. As of December 25, 1955, more than 12,200 industrial enterprises and more than 24,300 commercial enterprises had applied for joint state-private ownership. The industries that have been approved for complete joint state-private ownership are celebrating with drums and gongs, ensuring that they will do a good job in preparing for joint state-private ownership. Many people are working more conscientiously and responsibly, ensuring that they will complete production tasks on time, with the required quality and quantity. Some are even willing to take out their gold, US dollars, and silver dollars accumulated over the years and invest them in the enterprise, or convert their advances into the enterprise's capital.
    The emergence of such a joyous new atmosphere in the industrial and commercial circles is not accidental. This is the result of the correct leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government over the past six years since liberation. At the Third Session of the First Shanghai Municipal People's Congress held in December 1955, many comrades from the industrial and commercial circles recalled and compared the pre-liberation and post-liberation periods, conducted serious self-criticism, and gained a correct understanding of the main ideological problems that existed in the industrial and commercial circles in the past. This is a good foundation for us private industrialists and businessmen to accept socialist transformation.
    Previously, many people in the industrial and commercial circles thought that as long as they had enterprises and money, they could control their own destiny, as the saying goes, "With money, you can make the devil push the millstone." However, facts have proved that having enterprises and money does not guarantee control over one's destiny.
    One manager in the international trade industry said: "The secret of industry and commerce is to buy cheap and sell high. I often go to faraway places to buy at low prices and then sell at high prices. I have eaten a lot of small fish and shrimp, so my store has gradually grown. But when I encountered bureaucratic capital massively smuggling, dumping, and monopolizing the market, I lost 500,000 US dollars and almost went bankrupt."
    A department store manager said: "During World War II, I thought Japan would not dare to fight the United States. In order to prevent Japan from seizing my enterprise, I tried to register with the United States. But after Shanghai fell, precisely because it had an American business sign, the Japanese moved all the company's cash to the Bank of Taiwan and sent a supervisor. This proves that relying on imperialism is unreliable."
    Previously, some people in the industrial and commercial circles believed that they started from diligence and frugality, not from exploitation. Many capitalist agents believed that they did not have shares or had very few shares, and did not admit to any exploitation. Through analysis and criticism, these people began to change. One industrialist and businessman who came from a small clerk recently calculated a detailed account. He said: "If I calculate based on my salary of twenty yuan per month twenty-eight years ago, even if I didn't eat or wear anything, I would have to live 12,648 years to start this business." Then how could I have so much wealth in 28 years? This makes it clear that the so-called "starting from diligence and frugality" is essentially starting from exploitation. As for whether capitalist agents are involved in exploitation, it has also been clarified through study and discussion. One capitalist agent said: "The boss is like a big fish eating small fish, like I am 'viewing fish at Flower Harbor'. In fact, I am trying to make many small fish run together for the big fish to eat, and I can also get some small fish as rewards." He also said: "I also stipulated a weekly work system to deprive workers of their right to rest." This shows that agents are also exploiting. In short, under the capitalist system of private ownership of the means of production, it is extremely unreasonable for a few people to get rich and most people to suffer poverty, and this must be eliminated. Of course, some people in the industrial and commercial circles still have a knot in their minds, and they always feel a little sad and unconvinced about gradually giving up exploitation. I think this emotion should be overcome. We must all understand the laws of social development, thoroughly understand the unreasonableness of the exploitation system, and consciously change the unreasonable into the reasonable. The ancients said: Know your mistakes and correct them. It is truly shameful to make mistakes and not correct them. It is honorable and open to be able to correct them, and it can be welcomed by the people.
    Before liberation, when we in the industrial and commercial circles heard the Kuomintang reactionaries' distorted propaganda about "communism," we became restless and fearful. Now, this concern has gradually been eliminated. An old gentleman in the industrial and commercial circles said: "My ten children, some work in factories, some are people's teachers, and some are studying at universities. In the past, we wanted to accumulate more assets and use money to arrange for our children's future lives. I once divided part of the share capital of the enterprise into the names of my children. However, under the education and training of the state, their thinking has changed, and they have expressed their determination not to want it, which made me have to take it back. At that time, I was very unhappy, but now I understand that they are right." There was also a capitalist brother from a cotton weaving factory who wrote to Mayor Chen, deciding to invest 400 taels of family gold into the enterprise as capital in preparation for joint state-private ownership. The letter said: "We have a youngest brother who graduated from university and obeyed the unified allocation to work in a state-owned enterprise. We always want to send him some money, clothing, and daily necessities, but he doesn't want them, saying, 'I don't want money from home, I have my own labor income.'"
    The above situation shows that through recent study and discussion, our industrial and commercial circles have made great progress in their ideological understanding, expressing their willingness to take the socialist road, not only not afraid of "communism," but also welcoming "communism." At the same time, due to the sincere self-criticism, the distance in ideological and emotional terms with the people of the whole country has been further shortened, thereby enhancing political unity.
    However, we must also see that the process of accepting transformation is also a process of ideological struggle, and it is inevitable that new concerns will arise and new problems will emerge. In the industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai, it has been found that there are still a few people withdrawing funds, expanding expenses, and concealing and underreporting means of production. There are also a few people who take a wait-and-see and impatient attitude towards complete joint state-private ownership. Some people stop purchasing goods after hearing that complete joint state-private ownership has been approved. These petty actions, passive management, and impatient emotions are all wrong. Of course, this is not a strange thing, and it is bound to happen in the process of transformation. We cannot conclude from this that these industrial and commercial comrades cannot be transformed. The main reason is that our work has not been done thoroughly enough, and we have not universally and constantly explained the reasons to them. Therefore, the advanced core members of our Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce must take the lead, actively and consciously accept transformation, play a leading, backbone, and bridge role, go deep into the masses of the industrial and commercial circles, enthusiastically help others, patiently conduct persuasion and education, and lead them to accept transformation and make progress together. We must strive to help the government discover and cultivate new activists, expand the ranks of progressive core members in the industrial and commercial circles, and narrow the backward areas. At the same time, we must prevent and expose the destructive behavior of a few dregs in our industrial and commercial circles against socialist transformation. Only in this way can we live up to the earnest expectations of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for us.

　　放大眼光，努力学习，掌握自己的命运
    上海市工商业联合会主任委员　盛丕华
    1956年是第一个五年计划的第四年。国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，也进入新的发展阶段。我们上海广大的私营工商业者，在毛主席的伟大感召下，看清了前途，增强了接受社会主义改造的信心和力量。截至1955年12月25日为止，工业行业已申请公私合营的有12，200多户；商业行业已申请公私合营的有24，300多户。已经获得批准全业公私合营的行业，锣鼓喧天地奔走相告，保证要做好公私合营的筹备工作。不少人工作更加认真负责，保证要做到按质、按量、按时完成生产任务。还有一些人愿意把自己多年积蓄的黄金、美钞、银圆拿出来投入企业，或者把自己的垫款转作企业的资金。
    在工商界出现了这样一片喜气洋溢的新气象，并不是偶然的。这是解放六年来，中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导和教育的结果。在1955年12月召开的上海市第一届第三次人民代表大会上，许多工商界同志对解放前解放后作了回忆和对比，进行了严肃的自我批评，对过去在工商界思想上存在的几个主要问题，有了正确的认识。这是我们私营工商业者接受社会主义改造的良好基础。
    以前，工商界中许多人以为只要有了企业有了钱，就可以掌握自己的命运，所谓“有钱能使鬼推磨”。但是，事实证明，有了企业有了钱并不能掌握自己的命运。
    国际贸易业一个经理说：“工商业的秘诀就是贱价买进，高价卖出。我常常到老远地方去以低价收购，然后以高价卖出。小鱼虾米吃了不少，因此我店逐步壮大。但是遇到了官僚资本大量走私倾销、垄断市场，使我亏蚀了五十万美金，几乎破了产”。
    一个百货公司经理说：“第二次世界大战时期，我以为日本不敢同美国作战。为了防止日本侵占我的企业，设法向美国注了册。但是上海沦陷后，正因为挂了美商招牌，日本人把公司全部现金搬到台湾银行去，还派了监督官。这证明依赖帝国主义是靠不住的”。
    以前，工商界中有人认为自己是勤俭起家的，不是剥削。不少资方代理人以为自己没有股份或者股份很少，也不承认有剥削行为。通过分析批判，这些人开始有了转变。有一位小职员出身的工商业者，最近算了一笔细帐。他说：“假使以我二十八年前每月二十元的薪金收入计算一下，即使不吃不穿，要活12，648岁，才能办得起这个企业。”那末28年怎么能有这末许多资财呢？这就可以明白，所谓“勤俭起家”，实质上就是剥削起家。至于资方代理人是否有剥削的问题，通过学习讨论也明确了。有一位资方代理人说：“老板是大鱼吃小鱼，好像我是‘花港观鱼’。其实我是想法使许多小鱼跑拢来供大鱼吃，而自己也可得到几条小鱼的赏赐”他又说：“我还规定了礼拜工的制度来剥夺工人的休息权”。这说明代理人也是剥削的。’总之，在资本主义生产资料私有的剥削制度下，少数人发财致富，多数人贫穷受苦，这是极不合理的，是必须要消灭的。当然，工商界有些人的思想中还有一种疙瘩，总觉得逐步放弃剥削，有些难过，也有些不服。我认为这种情绪是应该努力克服的。我们大家要认识社会发展规律，彻底明白了剥削制度的不合理，就必须自觉地逐步改变不合理为合理。古人讲道：知过必改。过而不改真是可耻，过而能改就是光明磊落，毫无愧怍，而且能够为人民所欢迎。
    解放前，我们工商界听到国民党反动派对于“共产”的歪曲宣传，就动荡不安，着实害怕。现在，这种顾虑也逐步消除了。工商界一位老先生说：“我的十个子女，有的在厂里工作，有的在做人民教师，有的在大学里读书。以前我们想多积些资产，用金钱替儿女们安排将来的生活。我曾经将企业的一部分股本分写了儿女的名字。可是他们在国家的教育和培养下，思想转变了，纷纷表示坚决不要，弄得我只好再收回来。当时我还很不开心，现在明白他们是对的。”还有一家棉织厂的资方兄弟两人写信给陈市长，决定把传家的四百两黄金投入企业作资金，准备迎接公私合营。信上说到：“我们有一个最小的弟弟，大学毕业后服从统一调配，在国营企业工作。我们总想寄点钞票、衣着、日用品给他，他都不要，说‘我不要家里的钱，我有自己的劳动收入。’”
    以上的一些情况说明了我们工商界通过最近的学习讨论，思想认识是进了很大一步，表示愿意走社会主义道路，不但不怕“共产”，而且欢迎“共产”。同时，由于开展了诚恳的自我批评，在思想感情上同全国人民的距离愈加缩短，从而增进了政治上的团结。
    但是，我们也必须看到，接受改造的过程也即是思想斗争的过程，难免不发生新的顾虑，产生新的问题。在上海工商界中就发现还有少数人在抽逃资金，扩大开支，隐匿和少报生产资料。也有少数人对全业公私合营采取等待和急躁的态度，有的听到全业公私合营获得批准以后，就不再进货。这种搞小手脚、消极经营和急躁情绪都是不对的。当然这并不是奇怪的事，在改造过程中是必然会有的。不能由此得出结论，以为这些工商界同志是不能改造的。主要还是我们的工作没有做得到家，没有普遍地、不断地向他们说清道理的缘故。因此，我们民主建国会，工商业联合会的先进骨干分子，更要以身作则，主动地、自觉地接受改造，发挥带头、骨干和桥梁作用，深入工商界群众之中，热忱地帮助别人，耐心地进行说服教育，带动他们接受改造，共同进步。我们要努力帮助政府发现和培养新的积极分子，扩大工商界进步核心分子的队伍，缩小落后面。同时，我们要防止和揭发我们工商界中少数败类对社会主义改造的破坏行为。这样，才不辜负共产党和毛主席对我们殷切的期望。
