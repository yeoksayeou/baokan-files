Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin.
Following the complete transition of Tianjin's private commerce to the advanced form of state capitalism on the 9th, more than 5,000 factories in 50 private industrial sectors have now all implemented joint public-private ownership.

The Tianjin Municipal People's Committee approved on the 14th the implementation of joint public-private ownership for the remaining 37 private industrial sectors that had not yet implemented it, including machine manufacturing, electrical equipment, cotton weaving, printing and dyeing, printing, and tailoring.

After the spirit and resolutions of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Executive Committee meeting were conveyed to the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin, the capitalists in Tianjin recognized the development law of taking the socialist road and its benefits for themselves. They actively requested joint public-private ownership. In the past 40 days, an average of more than 100 private factories applied for joint public-private ownership every day. Many capitalists also voluntarily invested off-the-books assets and privately owned houses outside the enterprise into the enterprise to welcome joint public-private ownership. When the employees of private factories heard the news that the enterprise was about to be approved for joint public-private ownership, they were overjoyed and signed production pledges and launched labor competitions one after another.

Tianjin is the largest industrial and commercial city in northern China. Before liberation, the city's private industry was devastated by imperialism and bureaucratic capital. Production equipment was scattered and backward, and most of it was light industry. The only small amount of machine manufacturing was used to assemble imported goods or to package and process raw materials plundered by imperialism in China. Under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party's policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation after liberation, production had developed significantly, playing a certain role in supplying the needs of the country and the people. However, because the capitalist relations of production had not changed, the equipment and technology were backward, and it became increasingly unable to meet the requirements of national construction and the development of agricultural cooperation. Many precision machinery equipment and agricultural means of production needed by the country could not be manufactured by them, so there was a shortage of production tasks, and some factories could not even maintain production. After these industrial sectors are fully under joint public-private ownership, a series of reorganization and transformation work will be carried out according to the needs of the state to give full play to their production capacity.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 14th.
The capitalist industry and commerce in Xi'an have all implemented joint public-private ownership by industry. On the 13th, the Xi'an Municipal People's Committee approved the implementation of joint public-private ownership for the city's last 25 private industrial sectors with 300 factories and 36 private commercial sectors with more than 3,800 merchants. Together with the 41 industrial and commercial sectors previously approved, all 102 private industrial and commercial sectors and more than 5,900 factories and shops in Xi'an have implemented joint public-private ownership by industry.

At present, the joint public-private ownership cotton cloth, pastry, preserved food, tea, silk and other 13 commercial sectors have all completed the work of clearing and evaluating assets, and the cotton cloth and other 3 sectors have initially adjusted the commercial network.

The private industry and commerce in Xi'an are generally small and medium-sized households, scattered and backward, and the technology and equipment are very poor. In private commerce, due to the unreasonable distribution of the commercial network, it not only affects the market supply, but also creates an unbalanced state of business between households and between regions. In private industry, most are handicraft factories that can only produce a certain product. There are very few all-round factories, the product specifications are not uniform, and the quality is not high. After propaganda and education on socialist transformation, the vast majority of employees and capitalists realized that the only way to improve this unreasonable and backward state is to implement joint public-private ownership, so they have applied for it one after another.

### 天津西安私营工商业全部公私合营

    天津西安私营工商业全部公私合营
    据新华社天津讯  天津市私营商业9日全部过渡为国家资本主义的高级形式以后，私营工业50个行业5，000多个工厂已经全部实行公私合营。
    天津市人民委员会14日批准了还没有实行公私合营的机器制造、电工器材、棉织、印染、印刷、缝纫等37个私营工业行业实行公私合营。
    全国工商业联合会执行委员会会议的精神和决议在天津市工商界中传达以后，天津市的资本家认清了走社会主义道路的发展规律和对自己的好处，都积极要求公私合营，在过去的40天中，平均每天有100多户私营工厂申请公私合营。不少资本家还自动把账外资产和企业以外的自有房屋投入企业，迎接公私合营。私营工厂的职工听到企业快要被批准公私合营的消息，更是欢天喜地，纷纷订立生产公约，展开劳动竞赛。
    天津市是我国北方最大的工商业城市，这个城市的私营工业在解放以前受到帝国主义和官僚资本的摧残，生产设备分散落后，并且绝大部分是轻工业；仅有的少量机器制造业，也是给舶来品装配或为帝国主义在我国掠夺的原料作些包装和加工，不能制造机器。解放以后在中国共产党的利用、限制、改造政策指导下，生产曾有显著发展，在供应国家和人民需要方面起了一定的作用。但是由于资本主义的生产关系没有改变，设备和技术落后，越来越不能适应国家建设和农业合作化发展的要求。国家需要的许多精密机器设备和农业生产资料，它们都不能制造，因此就发生了生产任务不足，有些工厂甚至不能维持生产。这些工业行业在全业公私合营后，即将根据国家的需要进行一系列的改组改造工作，使它们的生产能力得到充分发挥。
    据新华社西安14日电  西安市资本主义工商业已经全部按行业实行公私合营。13日，西安市人民委员会批准了全市最后的25个私营工业行业的300家工厂和36个私营商业行业的3，800多户座商实行公私合营。加上以前批准的41个工商业行业，西安市102个私营工商业行业、5，900多户工厂商店已全部按行业实行了公私合营。
    现在，公私合营棉布、糕点、酱货、茶叶、绸丝等13个商业行业已全部完成清产估价工作，棉布等3个行业并已初步调整了商业网。
    西安市私营工商业一般都是中小型户，分散落后，技术设备很差。在私营商业中，由于商业网分布不合理，不但影响到市场供应，而且产生户与户之间，以及地区与地区之间营业不平衡的状态。在私营工业中，大部都是只能生产某一种产品的手工工厂，全能厂很少，产品规格不统一，质量不高。在经过社会主义改造的宣传教育后，绝大部分职工和资本家认识到要改善这种不合理的落后状态，只有实行公私合营，因此都纷纷提出了申请。
