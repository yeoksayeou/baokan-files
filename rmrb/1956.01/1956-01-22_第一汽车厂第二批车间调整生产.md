Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 21st. The air compressor section of the engine workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant began adjusting production on the 17th. The engine workshop is the first of the basic workshops in the second batch of adjustment production at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. This workshop will produce automobile engines. In the next three to four months, basic workshops such as the gearbox, stamping, spring, and foundry workshops, which are in the second batch of adjustment production, are planned to be put into adjustment production one after another.

All basic workshops of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant are divided into two batches for adjustment production. From August to October last year, the first batch of adjustment production was put into operation in seven basic workshops, including the chassis workshop, and one wire drawing workshop serving production. Thanks to the specific help of Soviet experts and the backbone role played by adjustment workers who had interned in the Soviet Union, the adjustment production proceeded relatively smoothly. By the end of last year, 760 kinds of parts had been manufactured in the adjustment production.

    第一汽车厂第二批车间调整生产
    新华社长春21日电　第一汽车制造厂发动机车间的空气压缩机工部已经在17日开始调整生产。发动机车间是第一汽车制造厂第二批调整生产的基本车间中的第一个。这个车间将生产汽车的发动机。在今后三、四个月内，计划在第二批调整生产的变速箱、冲压、弹簧和铸工等基本车间将陆续投入调整生产。
    第一汽车制造厂全部基本车间分作两批进行调整生产。去年8月到10月间，第一汽车制造厂底盘等7个基本车间和1个为生产服务的拔丝车间首批投入调整生产。由于苏联专家的具体帮助和曾在苏联实习的调整工发挥了骨干作用，调整生产进行得比较顺利，到去年年底已经在调整生产中制造出760种零件。
