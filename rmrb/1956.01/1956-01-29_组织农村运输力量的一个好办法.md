A Good Way to Organize Rural Transportation Forces
Deputy Director of the Highway Bureau, Ministry of Communications, Zhu Tianshun

Kangping County, Liaoning Province, has a population of 220,000. Its main agricultural and sideline products, such as grain, cotton, peanuts, soybeans, green hemp, live pigs, eggs, alkali, reeds, etc., are exported in addition to local consumption. Many production and living materials needed by the local people also need to be imported from the cities. At present, the main means of transportation are rural carts (rubber-tired carts, spoked carts) and automobiles. The county's traffic lines are mainly cart roads, some of which can also be used by cars seasonally. From the county seat via Faku to Tieling, there is a highway trunk line that is open to traffic all year round. In 1952 and 1953, because the agricultural cooperativization movement had not yet been carried out on a large scale and there were not enough state-owned automobiles, farmers used rubber-tired carts for transportation. In 1952, the county had more than 550 rubber-tired carts. Although this overcame some of the difficulties of insufficient transportation capacity, some farmers only focused on transportation business and neglected farming, and some even embarked on the capitalist road of hiring people to farm the land. After the publicity of the Party's general line during the transition period, with the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, this phenomenon of "abandoning agriculture for transportation" disappeared. However, soon after the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, a new contradiction appeared in rural transportation: the volume of material transportation increased day by day, while the number of state-owned automobiles was small, the roads were insufficient, and the rural vehicles could not participate in transportation not only during the busy farming season, but also many could not participate in transportation during the slack farming season. Even those who could participate in transportation were not organized. Therefore, after the second half of 1954, there were successive incidents of material backlog. In the third quarter of 1954, the supply and marketing cooperative of Sijiazi Village, Third District, Kangping County, because the purchased green hemp could not be transported out in time, and the warehouse capacity was small, stored more than 10,000 jin in the open air, which was damaged, and was forced to stop purchasing several times. Some farmers said: "It's too annoying! I will never grow this thing again next year!" The eggs and wheat purchased by this cooperative have also deteriorated due to untimely transportation. The daily necessities, fertilizers, grains, etc. needed by farmers are also often out of stock due to untimely transportation. Because the transportation department does not understand the source of goods and the overall transportation capacity, it cannot schedule transportation capacity in a planned way, is unable to meet the requirements of the shippers, and the freight rates are also very unstable. The material consignment department hired vehicles for transportation by itself, sometimes having to pay freight rates more than twice as high as those of the state-owned transportation department; sometimes it could not hire vehicles at all.

    In order to solve this contradiction, in the second half of 1954, the Kangping County Highway Transportation Station proposed to the Kangping County Party Committee that the highway transportation station, the cargo owner (at that time mainly the district supply and marketing cooperative, and later the grain purchasing and marketing station, food purchasing station) and the agricultural production cooperative should sign a "triangular transportation combination contract." Its contents are: 1. The county highway transportation station is responsible for organizing the county's transportation and scheduling transportation capacity in a planned way according to the source of goods and transportation capacity. The transportation task from Kangping County to Tieling is mainly undertaken by state-owned automobiles. The short-distance transportation task within the county should be given priority to the use of local agricultural production cooperatives' vehicles in accordance with the principle of not affecting agricultural production. When the local vehicles are insufficient, the horse-drawn carts and automobiles controlled by the transportation station will be transferred to transport. 2. The cargo owner should regularly submit a consignment plan to the transportation station, and the transportation station will uniformly allocate transportation capacity according to the needs. Before transportation, the cargo owner should prepare for packaging and transportation. 3. The transportation station organizes the idle vehicles of the agricultural production cooperative to participate in transportation according to the source of goods. When organizing them to participate in transportation, the district party committee and the district office should designate them to participate in accordance with the principle of giving priority to the needs of the agricultural production cooperative. The agricultural production cooperative should provide transportation vehicles according to its own strength, complete the transportation tasks as stipulated in the contract and ensure the quality of transportation. The county party committee approved these principles and required the district party committees to support them. Subsequently, the transportation station, according to the instructions of the county party committee, conducted pilot projects in the sixth and ninth districts. The results of the pilot projects proved that this method was successful. Then it was promoted throughout the county.

    The benefits of implementing the "triangular transportation combination contract" are:

    1. The transportation department has mastered the volume of goods and transportation capacity, so it can schedule transportation capacity in a planned way, rationally allocate transportation tasks, and ensure the timely completion of transportation tasks. For example, during the sowing period in April 1955, the state urgently needed to transport grain (including disaster relief grain) and soybean cake to the countryside, while most rural vehicles could not participate in transportation. After the transportation station transferred a part of state-owned automobiles and vehicles from institutions and enterprises for a concentrated transportation, it ensured the completion of this emergency task.

    2. It has brought into play the potential power of folk transportation tools and made up for the shortage of state-owned transportation capacity during the peak transportation season. In 1955, the transportation station organized rural carts to transport about 23,000 tons of goods, which not only met the needs of material transportation, but also increased the sideline income of agricultural production cooperatives. In 1955, the Sixth-Third Agricultural Production Cooperative increased two horses and two spoked carts with the income from transportation fees, solved the difficulty of fodder for all the livestock, and also used the income from transportation fees to open five qing and seven mu of wasteland, harvesting 8,000 jin of rice and 30,000 jin of rice straw. The Jianming Agricultural Production Cooperative also solved the problem of livestock feed with the income from transportation fees, thus consolidating the organization of the cooperative. With the contract, the agricultural production cooperative can also plan agricultural production and sideline transportation in a planned way.

    3. It has stabilized freight rates and transportation order, and basically turned the free transportation market into a planned and organized transportation market. Now, the county's freight rates have been unified and stabilized, and all kinds of transportation tools have been rationally arranged. State-owned automobiles mainly undertake highway trunk line transportation from Kangping to Tieling; rural sideline vehicles mainly undertake transportation within the county, concentrating goods for automobiles; a part of the year-round business horse-drawn carts are organized by the transportation station to undertake sporadic freight transportation within the territory, and are used as a mobile force.

    4. It has enhanced the sense of responsibility of the transportation department and improved the quality of work, especially changing the stall-style business method. Now the Kangping County Highway Transportation Station has designated special personnel to be responsible for inspecting the implementation of the contract in the designated districts and villages. The material consignment department reflects that the quality of transportation has been significantly improved since the implementation of the triangular transportation contract. The value of materials lost in the transportation of the Fangjiatun Supply and Marketing Cooperative in 1954 was 297 yuan, which was reduced to 185 yuan in 1955.

    Of course, after the Kangping County Highway Transportation Station implemented the "triangular transportation combination contract," there are still some shortcomings. For example, the business agency fees charged in the consignment process are still relatively high, and there is a lack of long-term and comprehensive planning for the county's transportation, etc. However, in any case, as far as the current situation is concerned, it is still a good way to organize rural transportation forces and serve agricultural cooperativization, which is worthy of learning and promotion in various places. All transportation stations across the country should, like the Kangping Transportation Station, under the leadership of the Party Committee, actively and deeply carry out transportation organization work, so that highway transportation can better serve agricultural cooperativization.

    组织农村运输力量的一个好办法
    交通部公路总局副局长　朱田顺
    辽宁省康平县是一个拥有22万人口的县。主要农副产品如粮食、棉花、花生、大豆、青麻、生猪、鸡蛋、土碱、苇子等，除当地自用外，都要输出。而当地人民所需要的许多生产和生活资料，也要从城市输入。目前，主要运输工具是农村大车（胶轮车、花毂辘车）和汽车。县内交通线主要是大车道，其中有些线也能季节性地通行汽车。从县城经法库到铁岭有一条四季通车的公路干线。在1952年和1953年，由于农业合作化运动还没有大开展和国营汽车不足，农民就利用胶轮车来从事运输。1952年，全县胶轮大车曾发展到550多台。这虽然克服了一部分运输力量不足的困难，但是，有的农民只顾从事运输业务，而忽视种庄稼，有的人甚至走上了雇人种地的资本主义道路。经过党在过渡时期的总路线的宣传，随着农业合作化运动的开展，这种“弃农务运”的现象没有了。但是，不久由于农业合作化运动的开展，便又在农村运输中出现了一个新的矛盾：物资运输量日益增加，而国营汽车数量少，道路不足，农村的车辆不要说在农忙季节不能参加运输，就是在农闲季节也有很多不能参加运输。能参加运输的也无人加以组织。因此，在1954年后半年就陆续发生了物资积压现象。1954年第三季度康平县三区四家子村供销合作社就因为收购的青麻不能及时运出，仓库容量又小，在露天存放，损坏了一万多斤，并且几次被迫停止收购。有的农民说：“太别气了！来年再也不种这玩艺啦！”这个社收购的鸡蛋、小麦等，也曾经因为运输不及时而变质。农民所需要的日用品、肥料、粮食等，也常常因为运输不及时而脱销。运输部门因为不了解货源和全部运力情况，不能有计划地调度运力，无力满足货主的要求，运价也很不稳定。物资托运部门自己雇车运输，有时不得不拿出高于国营运输部门运价两倍多的运费；有时根本雇不到车子。
    为了解决这一个矛盾，1954年下半年，康平县公路运输站向中共康平县委提出由公路运输站、货主（当时主要是区供销社，后来又增加粮食购销站、食品采购站）和农业生产合作社三方面订立“三角运输结合合同”的建议。它的内容是：一、由县公路运输站根据货源和运输力量的情况，负责组织全县的运输，有计划地调度运力。由康平县城到铁岭的运输任务，主要由国营汽车来担负。县内短途运输任务，在不影响农业生产的原则下，尽先利用当地农业生产合作社的车辆来运输。当地车辆不足的时候，再抽调运输站所掌握的马车和汽车运输。二、货主应定期向运输站报送托运计划，运输站按照需要统一调配运输力量。在运输前，货主应该做好包装和运输准备工作。三、运输站根据货源情况，组织农业生产合作社的农闲车辆参加运输。在组织他们参加运输的时候，区委、区公所应该按照尽先照顾困难社的原则指定他们参加。农业生产合作社应该根据自己力量，提供运输车辆，按合同规定完成运输任务并且保证运输质量。中共县委批准了这些原则，并且要求各区委加以支持。随后，运输站根据县委指示，在六、九区进行了试点。试点结果证明这个办法是成功的。接着就在全县推广开了。
    实行“三角运输结合合同”的好处是：
    一、运输部门掌握了货物运量和运输力量，就能够有计划地调度运输力量，合理分配运输任务，保证及时完成运输任务。例如，1955年4月份播种期间，国家迫切需要向农村运送粮食（包括救灾粮）和豆饼，而农村大部分车辆又不能参加运输。经过运输站抽调一部分国营汽车和机关企业车辆突击运输后，才保证了这一紧急任务的完成。
    二、发挥了民间运输工具的潜在力量，弥补了运输旺季国营运力的不足。1955年运输站组织农村大车运送了约23，000吨货物，不仅满足了物资运输的需要，也增加了农业生产合作社的副业收入。1955年六三农业生产合作社靠运费收入增加了两匹马和两个花毂辘车，解决了全部牲口的草料困难，还利用运费收入开了五垧七亩荒地，收了八千斤稻子，三万斤稻草。建明农业生产合作社靠运费收入也解决了牲畜草料的问题，从而巩固了合作社的组织。由于有了合同，农业生产合作社也可以有计划地安排农业生产和副业运输。
    三、稳定了运价和运输秩序，使自由的运输市场基本上变成了有计划有组织的运输市场。现在，这个县全县的运价已经统一、稳定，各种运输工具都得到了合理的安排。国营汽车主要担负从康平到铁岭的公路干线运输；农村副业车辆主要担负县内运输，为汽车集中货源；一部分长年营业马车由运输站加以组织担负境内零星货运，并且作为机动力量。
    四、增强了运输部门的责任心，提高了工作质量，特别是改变了坐摊式的经营方法。现在康平县公路运输站已经指定了专门的人员，负责到所指定的区村检查合同的执行情况。物资托运部门反映，实行三角运输合同以后，运输质量有了显著提高。方家屯供销社1954年运输中损失的物资价值297元，1955年就减为185元。
    当然，康平县公路运输站推行“三角运输结合合同”以后，也还是存在着一些缺点的。例如，在托运过程中收取的业务代理费还比较高，对全县交通运输缺乏长期的全面的规划等。但是，无论如何，就目前来说，它还是组织农村运输力量、为农业合作化服务的一个好办法，值得各地学习和推广。全国所有的运输站都应该像康平运输站一样，在党委的领导下，主动深入地进行运输组织工作，使公路运输更好地为农业合作化服务。
