    Strive to Cultivate a Large Number of Young Experts
    Li Chang, President of Harbin Institute of Technology

    In the six years since the national liberation, the Party has indeed made great achievements in its work on intellectuals. The Party has not only carried out tremendous and effective work in uniting, educating, and transforming the original senior intellectuals, but has also cultivated and is cultivating a large number of young experts.

    Massively cultivating new experts is of particularly great significance for higher industrial education. Because of the rapid development of higher industrial education in recent years, the number of older teachers is becoming increasingly insufficient. And there are many important emerging specialties that were rarely or never studied in the country in the past. In fact, young teachers trained in the past few years under the direct leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts have become the main teaching force in some schools.

    Take Harbin Institute of Technology as an example. This school was handed over to our government by the Sino-Soviet Jointly Operated Changchun Railway in 1950 and expanded under the leadership of the Party, with the help of Soviet experts, and the support of various higher industrial schools. In the past, the teachers were all Soviet citizens. Since the takeover until now, only eight old teachers have been hired to teach science and engineering courses, and the faculty is severely lacking. Therefore, graduate students, under the guidance of Soviet experts, learned and taught at the same time, and took on the responsibilities of department heads and heads of teaching and research sections before graduation. In this way, although the number of students has grown from 500 five years ago to nearly 5,500 today, and will increase to 7,300 in the second half of this year, the difficulties have been overcome. The school has still been successfully run. Up to now, Harbin Institute of Technology has formed a faculty of more than 500 people, with 210 graduates and five-year graduates of this school as the backbone. Relying on this team, Harbin Institute of Technology has trained three classes of five-year graduates according to the new teaching plan. In the field of scientific research, young teachers have also made preliminary achievements. For example, they have solved the problem of domestically producing high-quality Soviet Э-42 welding rods, designed 220,000-volt high-voltage transmission towers, and created corn milling cutters, which are helpful for the development of the national economy.

    These situations show that Chinese youth have abundant energy and endless wisdom. As long as we strengthen leadership and diligently learn from the advanced Soviet science, we will definitely be able to quickly cultivate a large number of new experts and continuously improve the professional and political levels of both new and old experts.

    However, we have shortcomings in cultivating and promoting new experts. We often do not stand in front of new things, paving the way for their development, but express doubt and indifference towards them, which objectively plays a hindering role. Until now, Harbin Institute of Technology, except for a very few professors and associate professors who have returned from studying in the United Kingdom and the United States or hired from other schools, has neither professors, associate professors, nor lecturers. Without these titles, the issue of teachers' compensation cannot be fully resolved. However, Harbin Institute of Technology is a newly emerging school. We have not evaluated teacher titles in the past, and the teachers are all young, so evaluation needs to be particularly cautious and requires waiting for regulations, etc. We ourselves also feel that these new teachers have grown up before our very eyes, are young, and it doesn't matter if the evaluation is a little slower. The evaluation method of the Ministry of Higher Education for this semester has been issued, but because we were carrying out the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the school started late and the tasks were heavy, we didn't grasp it tightly, and dragged this matter down.

    As early as two years ago, Soviet experts at Harbin Institute of Technology raised such questions: "Why don't you believe in the experts you have cultivated yourselves?" "Does your wage policy implement the socialist principle of distribution according to work?" At that time, I could only answer: The titles and wages of professors were determined in the past, and there are no regulations on how to grant academic degrees and determine corresponding wages for new teachers, which still needs to be waited for. Young teachers are growing rapidly, and we believe that we should formulate a system of academic degrees and academic titles as soon as possible, and appropriately revise the wage regulations to facilitate the cultivation and promotion of young experts.

    Of course, merely taking these measures is not enough. More importantly, we must ensure that new and old experts, in addition to undertaking certain teaching work, also have a certain amount of time to engage in scientific research, or that more people can be drawn from them to study in the Soviet Union. This is the key to continuously improving their professional level. At present, the frequent meetings of teaching backbones, excessive part-time jobs, and excessive administrative burdens are indeed a problem that must be effectively resolved. But from the situation of Harbin Institute of Technology, the problem also lies in the fact that among the 500+ teachers, there are 100 teaching assistants who graduated from four-year schools, and 200 teaching assistants who graduated from three-year university and specialized courses. They have not completed the five-year curriculum and need to make up lessons. Therefore, they cannot bear the full workload of teaching, which also increases the burden on the teaching backbone. Due to the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization and the acceleration of industrialization, this year's enrollment task cannot be reduced, but must be increased. It is even more difficult to meet the requirements for the replenishment of teachers, which makes the problem even more serious.

    Based on this situation, we feel that we must fundamentally change the passive situation of higher industrial education, strengthen the leadership of the Party, give full play to the enthusiasm of the competent departments and various schools, boldly run schools, and solve the contradiction between tasks and the strength of teachers in development. That is to say, in addition to stipulating the state's task of training talents that each school must complete and giving a certain number of teacher supplements, especially teaching assistants in majors that cannot be trained by the school itself, each school should also be allowed to enroll students as reserve forces for the school's faculty, continuously supplementing the faculty, so as to gradually ensure that teachers have the necessary time to conduct scientific research, putting teaching work on the basis of research work, and continuously improving the scientific level of teachers.

    Of course, doing so also has difficulties, but it is much better than being clueless and worrying every year about the increase in tasks and the corresponding failure to supplement teachers. Students who are enrolled more can start to be transferred out to teach and study at the same time in two or three years. This method of training teachers is not too slow. At the same time, because they are the school's own children, it is easier to persuade them ideologically early and assign them to teach basic courses and technical basic courses.

    Labor intellectuals are an indispensable and close alliance of workers and peasants in building socialism. In the past, we lacked a deep understanding of this point. We have not contacted teachers proactively and enthusiastically enough, and we have not provided enough understanding and help to them. The work of developing Party members among them has not been done enough, and some living problems have not been resolved in a timely manner. These are all wrong. We guarantee that we will conduct an in-depth inspection and effectively improve our work on teachers in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee.

    努力培养大批年轻的专家
    哈尔滨工业大学校长　李昌
    全国解放六年来，党对知识分子的工作确实取得了很大的成绩。党不仅在团结教育和改造原有的高级知识分子方面进行了巨大的有成效的工作，而且已经并且正在培养着大批年轻的专家。
    大量培养新的专家，对高等工业教育有着特别重大的意义。因为几年来高等工业教育的飞跃发展，老教师越来越显得少了。而有很多重要的新兴的专业，过去国内很少甚至根本没有人学过。事实上，这几年在党的直接领导和苏联专家帮助下培养出来的年轻教师，在某些学校里已经成为主要的教学力量。
    以哈尔滨工业大学为例。这个学校是在1950年由中苏合办的中长铁路移交我国政府，在党的领导和苏联专家的帮助以及各高等工业学校支持下扩建起来的。从前教师都是苏侨，接管后到现在，教理工课程的只聘到八位老教师，师资十分缺乏。因此，研究生便在苏联专家的指导下边学边教，没有结业就担任了教研室主任和系主任。这样，尽管学生已经从5年前的500人，发展到今天的近5，500人，而今年下半年又将增加到7，300人，困难是克服了。学校还是办下来了。到目前为止，哈尔滨工业大学已经形成了以本校结业的研究生和五年制毕业生210人为骨干的500多人的教师队伍。依靠这支队伍，哈尔滨工业大学已经按照新的教学计划培养出三届五年制毕业生。在科学研究方面，青年教师也有了初步的成就。例如解决了我国自制苏联Э——42型优质焊条的问题，设计了22万伏高压输电铁塔和创造了玉米铣刀等，是有助于国民经济的发展的。
    这些情况说明，我国青年有着充沛的精力和无尽的智慧，只要加强领导，努力学习苏联的先进科学，我们一定能够迅速地培养出大批新的专家和不断提高新老专家的业务和政治水平。
    但是在培养和提拔新专家方面，我们是有缺点的。我们常常不是站在新事物面前，为他们的发展开辟道路，而是对他们表示怀疑和冷淡，客观上起了阻碍作用。直到现在，哈尔滨工业大学除了极少数从英美留学回来或从其他学校聘请来的教授、副教授外，既没有教授、副教授，也没有讲师。没有这些称号，就没有完全解决教师的待遇问题。可是哈尔滨工业大学是新兴的学校，我们过去没有评定过教师称号，教师又都是青年，要评就需要特别慎重，需要等待条例办法等等。我们自己也觉得这些新教师是我们亲眼看着成长的，年纪轻，慢一点评也不要紧。这个学期高等教育部的评定办法是发下来了，我们又因为进行肃反，开学晚了些，任务繁重，抓的不紧，把这件事情拖下来了。
    远在两年以前，哈尔滨工业大学的苏联专家就提出了这样的疑问：“你们为什么对自己培养出来的专家不相信？”“你们的工资政策是否实行按劳取酬的社会主义原则？”我当时只好这样答复：教授们的称号和工资是过去就确定了的，对新的教师如何授予学衔和确定相应的工资还没有规定，尚需等待。年轻教师成长很快，我们认为现在应该尽快地把学位、学衔等制度制定出来，并且要适当地修改工资规定，以利于培养和提拔青年专家。
    当然仅仅采取这些措施还是不够的，更重要的是要保证新老专家除了担负一定的教学工作外，还有一定的时间从事科学研究工作，或从他们中能够更多地抽出一些人到苏联留学。这是不断提高他们的业务水平的关键。目前教学骨干会议频繁，兼职过多，行政工作负担过重，确是一个问题，必须切实解决。但从哈尔滨工业大学的情况看，问题还在于500多教师中，四年制学校毕业的助教有100人，读过3年大学和专修科毕业的助教有200人，他们没有学完五年制的课程，需要补课。因此，他们就不能担负全部的教学工作量，这一来，也就加重了教学骨干的负担。由于农业合作化高潮的到来和工业化的加速，今年招生任务不仅不能减少，反而更要加大，师资补充更难满足要求，越发使问题严重了。
    根据这种情况，我们觉得必须根本上改变高等工业教育的被动形势，加强党的领导，充分发挥主管部门和各校的积极性，放手办学校，从发展中解决任务和师资力量的矛盾。就是说，除规定各校必须完成的国家的培养人材的任务和给予一定的师资补充名额，特别是本校不能培养的专业的助教外，还要允许各校招收学生，作为本校师资的后备力量，源源不断地补充教师队伍，以便逐步能够保证教师有必要的时间进行科学研究工作，把教学工作放在研究工作的基础之上，并且不断地提高教师的科学水平。
    这样做当然也有困难，但比心中无数，每年担心任务增加、师资不能相应补充的情况要好得多。多招的学生两三年后就可以开始调出去边教边学。这样培养教师，速度也还不算慢。同时由于他们是本校子弟兵，及早进行思想动员工作，分配他们教基础课和技术基础课也比较容易安下心来。
    劳动知识分子是工人、农民在建设社会主义中不可缺少的亲密的联盟，过去我们对这一点缺乏深刻的认识。我们主动地热情地同教师接触是不够的，对他们的了解帮助也少，在他们中发展党员的工作做得不够，有些生活问题没有及时解决。这都是不对的。我们保证：一定根据中央的指示深入检查和切实改进我们对教师的工作。
