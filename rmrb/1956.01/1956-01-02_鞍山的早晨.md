Anshan's Morning
By our reporter Lu Hao

　　Before the magnificent lights on both sides of Rainbow Bridge have been extinguished, the black metallurgical design institute building overlooking Anshan in the dim morning light has gradually revealed its magnificent appearance. Row upon row of blast furnaces, like the castles of the South Heaven Gate in mythology, are wrapped in smoke in mid-air. The molten iron flowing out of the furnace hearth illuminates the area in a crimson glow. If people cannot distinguish directions, they will mistake this for the morning glow reflecting the sky. Although the cloud-like black smoke rolls over from the towering chimneys of the steelmaking plant, as the night begins to fade at the edge of the earth, this increasingly large red sky cannot be concealed. At this time, I know that dawn has come to Anshan again. In the morning of Anshan, where the voices of "completing the Five-Year Plan in four years" are rising, I know that on the open hearth furnace hanging with small red flags that read "Today we are producing rapid steel," molten steel is surging into the ladles. Here, I met Li Shangzhong, the furnace chief of No. 1 furnace. He and his comrades-in-arms worked together with Kolesnikov, the "best steelworker in the country" from the Soviet Union, to produce a furnace of steel on October 8th. Kolesnikov created a new record for "rapid steelmaking" in the steel plant in 7 minutes and 55 seconds on this unfamiliar open hearth furnace. The day after he left us, our Li Shangzhong created a new record of producing a furnace of steel in 7 hours! This is 55 minutes faster than the furnace of steel made by our friend. Although Kolesnikov came to our open hearth furnace only once, the steel he brought to our steel plant is difficult to calculate in numbers. In the two months of October and November, our steel plant, because of the repeated appearance of "rapid steelmaking" throughout the plant, has produced at least 20,000 tons of steel more for our motherland. In the past 11 months of last year, 111 furnaces of "rapid steelmaking" appeared in the No. 1 open hearth furnace where Li Shangzhong is located. Time is truly an infinitely precious treasure for our steel plant. Here, as long as the smelting time of each furnace of steel can be shortened by five minutes, the steel plant can produce 10,800 tons of steel more for the motherland.

　　In the morning of Anshan, where more steel is being produced for the motherland every moment, I walked towards the famous No. 7 blast furnace with young furnace chief Wang Hongshun. I know that No. 7 blast furnace started production on December 20th last year according to this year's new quota, which requires this blast furnace to produce 143 tons of pig iron more for the motherland every day. I know that the Soviet steam blast furnace operation method was first promoted on this blast furnace. This advanced experience enables this blast furnace to produce thousands of tons more molten iron every month. No. 7 blast furnace had already completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule on December 10th last year. Last year, each person in the ironmaking plant produced 138 tons of pig iron for our motherland. Thanks to the efforts of all employees in the ironmaking plant and the continuous birth of new blast furnaces, the plant's output has increased by more than one and a half times compared to the year before the start of the first five-year plan. Now the ironmaking plant is engaged in a tense battle to increase production by more than 115,800 tons of pig iron.

　　In the morning of Anshan, where good news of production is sent to all parts of the motherland every day, I met Li Yuanhui, the duty foreman of the young rolling mill section, at the elevator platform of the large rolling mill. He is only 25 years old this year. After graduating from the Department of Metallurgy of Northeast Institute of Technology in 1952, he came to Anshan. When he first came to the large rolling mill, he didn't even understand the performance and structure of these equipments. But with the help of Soviet expert Comrade Kuchayev, Li Yuanhui has now become an expert in mastering the adjustment of rolling mills. I know that recently, this factory is working hard to roll steel rails for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. Since the large rolling mill was built two years ago, the steel rails it has produced have been laid for nearly 5,000 kilometers of railway. In addition to producing a large number of steel rails, it has also supplied many steel structure frames, car bottom beams, and various bridge steels for many of our country's magnificent constructions. This rolling mill's production plan for this year is 53.84% higher than last year. From the blackboard newspaper at the factory gate, you can know that this factory is also rolling the famous Yangtze River Bridge's bridge steel. When the bridge piers of the bridge between Turtle Mountain and Snake Mountain began underwater construction not long ago, the bridge steel for the future bridge has already been rolled here, and more than 7,000 tons have been sent to the bridge factory for splicing.

　　In the morning of Anshan, where everyone is making leaps and bounds and everyone has a bright future, I met engineer Qi Baozong in the building of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute. Before liberation, he was engaged in design in the ore dressing plant, and one ore dressing plant failed to start construction after three years. Now he is the chief person in charge of the design of four projects, including Anshan's second largest ore dressing plant in the country. Today, not only have the old engineering and technical personnel swept away their years of depression, but also all the young people here have given full play to their talents. When the Black Metallurgical Design Institute was first established, the main members were graduates from universities and secondary specialized technical schools. Wang Guofu used to be a technician in the power supply station, and now he is the head of the machine and automatic device section. Whether it is the power station in Fushun and Shijingshan, or the cement plant in Benxi and the Daye Steel Plant, the various automatic devices there are all designed by them. Our Black Metallurgical Design Institute independently designed 107 projects last year. Not long ago, the design work of China's blast furnaces, coke ovens, steel plants, and mines was entrusted to the Soviet Union. Now the Black Metallurgical Design Institute has been able to undertake complex preliminary design work. The design drawings of the recently completed Taiyuan Refractory Material Factory were all completed relying on our own design strength.

　　In the morning of the Anshan construction site, where all kinds of machines are roaring and boiling, what was once an open space not long ago is now lined with crisscrossing pipeline networks along the roadside. Locomotives are happily running in the newly rebuilt factory buildings, dragging full tanks of molten iron. Here, you can also see the inspiring achievements of China's machinery industry. Only recently, when workers were installing blast furnaces, large gantry hoists and charging car hoists and other components were still shipped from the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries, but the new equipment currently under construction is completely manufactured by China, except for the instrument item supplied from abroad. Next to the gas heating station, I met Hu Zhaosen of the Power Section of the Blast Furnace Installation Engineering Company. This student, who graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 1952, has now become an expert in leading the installation of turbine blowers. People still remember that from June 1952, Hu Zhaosen and the comrades of the Power Section, with the help of Soviet expert Shabashov, began to learn to install the first turbine blower. At that time, the installation work lasted for a total of eight and a half months and took 14,000 man-hours. Now Shabashov has long returned to his country with peace of mind. In April last year, the eighth turbine blower installed by Hu Zhaosen and his team took only two and a half months, using only 2,400 man-hours, and guaranteed first-class quality. In the new year, sixteen turbine blowers will be waiting for them to install, and all the work is more than the sum of their two years of work. Among them, the installation of four turbine blowers will be carried out in Benxi, and some of Anshan's builders have already begun to move to new battle posts.

　　Our Anshan produced hundreds of thousands of tons more steel and iron for our motherland last year, which is a major contribution to our socialist construction cause. The morning of the new year, the morning of Anshan, is a morning of battle, a vibrant and desirable happy morning!

　　鞍山的早晨
    本报记者　陆灏
    当虹桥两边的辉煌的灯火还没有熄灭，在晨曦蒙胧中俯视鞍山的黑色冶金设计院的大楼已经渐渐地露出它的壮丽的面貌。一座一座的高炉，很像神话中南天门的城堡似地被烟雾裹在半空中。从炉膛里奔流出来的铁水把这一带都照得一片绯红，如果是人们不辨方向，一定会错把这当作是朝霞映红了天空。尽管那像云彩般的黑色的浓烟从炼钢厂那边一排高耸入云的烟囱里飞滚过来，但是由于黑夜已经开始在大地的边缘消逝，这越来越大的红色的天空是无论如何也遮掩不住的了。这时间，我知道是黎明又来到了鞍山。在这五年计划要在四年完成的声浪四起的鞍山的早晨，我知道在挂着“今日我们出快速炼钢”的小红旗的平炉上，钢水正在汹涌地倒入盛钢桶。在这儿，我见到一号炉的炉长李尚忠，就是他和他的战友们在10月8日的那一天，和苏联“国家最好的钢铁工人”科列斯尼科夫共同炼过一炉钢。科列斯尼科夫在这陌生的平炉上用7点55分的时间创造了炼钢厂“快速炼钢”的新纪录。在他离开我们的第二天，我们的李尚忠创造了7小时出一炉钢的新纪录！这比我们的朋友炼的那炉钢还快了55分钟。虽然是科列斯尼科夫来到我们的平炉只有一次，但是他给我们炼钢厂带来的钢是难以用数字来计算的。我们的炼钢厂，在10月和11月的两个月里，因为“快速炼钢”在全厂的一再出现，它至少为我们的祖国多生产了两万吨钢。在去年的11个月里，李尚忠所在的一号平炉出现了111炉“快速炼钢”。时间对于我们的炼钢厂真是无限宝贵的财富。在我们这里，只要每炉钢的熔炼时间能够缩短五分钟，炼钢厂就能为祖国多生产10，800吨钢。
    在这每时每刻都在为祖国生产更多钢铁的鞍山的早晨，我同青年炉长王洪顺走向著名的第七号高炉。我知道七号高炉去年12月20日就开始用今年的新定额来进行生产，这个新的定额要求这座高炉每天为祖国多生产143吨生铁。我知道苏联的蒸气鼓风操作法，就是在这座高炉上开始推行的，这个先进经验使这座高炉每个月要多吐出上千吨的铁水。七号高炉在去年的12月10日就已经提前完成了全年的生产计划。去年的炼铁厂，每一个人为我们的祖国生产了138吨生铁。由于炼铁厂全体职工的努力和新的高炉的不断诞生，这个厂的产量比第一个五年计划的开始的前一年已经提高了一倍半以上。现在炼铁厂正为增产115，800多吨生铁进行着紧张的战斗。
    在这天天都有生产的喜报传向祖国各地的鞍山的早晨，我在大型轧钢厂的升降台边，见到年轻的轧钢工段的值班工长李袁辉，他今年才25岁，1952年在东北工学院冶金系毕业以后就来到鞍山，他初来大型轧钢厂的时候，连这些设备的性能和构造都不懂得，但是在苏联专家库恰耶夫同志的帮助下，李袁辉现在已经成为一个掌握轧钢机调整的专家了。我知道最近以来，这个工厂正在紧张地为兰新铁路轧制钢轨，自从大型轧钢厂建成二年以来，它所生产的钢轨已经铺了近五千公里的铁路。它除了生产大量的钢轨外，它还给我国很多宏伟的建设供应了很多钢结构的房架、车厢的底梁，以及各种各样的桥梁钢。这个轧钢厂今年的生产计划比去年提高53.84％。从厂房门口的黑板报上，就可以知道这个厂同时也正在轧制著名的长江大桥的桥梁钢。当龟山和蛇山之间的大桥桥墩开始水下施工不久的时候，未来大桥的桥梁钢已经在这里轧制，目前已有七千多吨被送交桥梁工厂去拼接了。
    在这每个人都在飞跃地进步，每一个人都有美好的前途的鞍山的早晨，我在黑色冶金设计院的大楼里，见到工程师祁宝宗。解放前，他在选矿厂搞设计，有一个选矿厂搞了三年也开不了工。现在他是全国最大的鞍山第二选矿厂等四个工程设计的总负责人。今天不但是老工程技术人员一扫多少年来的苦闷，年轻人在这里也全都发挥了他们的才能。黑色冶金设计院在初创的时候，主要的成员是大学和中等专门技术学校的毕业生。王果富过去在供电站当技术员，现在是机器和自动装置科的负责人，不管是抚顺和石景山的发电站，或者是本溪的水泥厂和大冶钢厂，那里的各种自动化的装置都是经过他们的手设计出来的。我们的黑色冶金设计院在去年独立设计的就有107项工程，在不久之前，我国的高炉、炼焦炉、炼钢厂到矿山的设计工作都是委托苏联来进行的，现在黑色冶金设计院已经能够担任复杂的初步设计工作了。最近完成的太原耐火材料厂的设计图纸，就是全部依靠自己的设计力量完成的。　　在这各种机器轰鸣的沸腾的鞍山工地的早晨，不久以前还是空旷的平地，现在路边已经矗立起纵横交错的管道网。机车拖曳着满罐的铁水在新改建成的厂房里快活地奔走。在这里，你还可以看到我国机械工业的令人振奋的成就。仅仅是在不久之前，工人们在安装高炉的时候，大盖卷扬机和料罐卷扬机及其他部件，还是从苏联和各人民民主国家运来的，而现在正在施工的高炉，除计器一项是国外供应外，其余的新设备已经完全是我国自己制造的了。在瓦斯加热站的旁边，我碰见高炉安装工程公司动力工段的胡兆森，这位1952年毕业于上海交通大学的学生，现在已经成为领导安装透平鼓风机的能手。人们还记得从1952年的6月开始，胡兆森和动力工段的同志们在苏联专家沙巴少夫的帮助下，开始学习安装第一台透平鼓风机的时候，那一次，安装工作一共进行了八个半月，用了14，000个工时。现在沙巴少夫早就已经放心地回到他的祖国。在去年4月，胡兆森他们安装的第八台透平鼓风机，费时仅两个半月，只用了2，400个工时，而且保证了头等的质量。在新的一年里头，将有十六台透平鼓风机等待他们去安装，全部的工作比他们两年工作的总和还要多。其中有四台透平鼓风机的安装工程要在本溪进行，鞍山的建设者有的已经开始走向新的战斗岗位了。
    我们的鞍山在去年一年里，为我们的祖国多生产了几十万吨钢和铁，这对于我们社会主义的建设事业是个重大的贡献。新的一年刚刚来临的早晨，鞍山的早晨，是战斗的早晨，是朝气勃勃的令人向往的幸福的早晨！
