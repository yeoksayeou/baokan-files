    What Good is the Dollar?
    After Chiang bandit's Civil Aviation Bureau pilot Wei David and two others defected with an airplane, those who panicked were clearly not just the Chiang bandit clique, but also their master.
    When a lackey gets into trouble, the master comes to cover it up. "Voice of America" broadcast on the 10th that the Chiang bandit "Air Force authorities declared that no civil aviation company's aircraft was missing." According to the propaganda makers at "Voice of America," since it was declared that there was no such incident, other Chiang bandit flight personnel in Taiwan would not follow Wei David's example.
    Unfortunately, although no Taiwan civil aviation company's aircraft "went missing," a Taiwan Civil Aviation Bureau aircraft did indeed "go missing," and was later found on the mainland.
    After the defection of Wei David and others, the Associated Press reported that the Chiang bandit air force authorities admitted that someone had flown a small aircraft "towards the mainland," and that the aircraft "disappeared after reaching the Chinese coast." The Associated Press specifically pointed out that the "Civil Aviation Bureau" and "Civil Air Transport" were two "completely unrelated" organizations. "Voice of America"'s propaganda is an attempt to force a square peg into a round hole to cover up the truth. But the fact that Wei David and others defected cannot be concealed after all, and "Voice of America" has once again proven itself to be a liar.
    The US government recently announced that it would increase large appropriations to strengthen international propaganda organizations such as "Voice of America." But when "Voice of America" can only use disgusting lies as its propaganda capital, what good is the dollar? (Jiang)

    美元何济于事
    蒋贼台湾民用航空局飞行员韦大卫等三人驾驶飞机一架起义以后，着慌的显然不止蒋贼集团，而且还有它的主子。
    奴才出了事情，主子就来遮掩。“美国之音”在10日广播说，蒋贼“空军当局声明，并没有任何民航公司的飞机失踪”。照“美国之音”的宣传家们的想法，既然声明了并无此事，台湾的旁的蒋贼飞行人员就不会学韦大卫他们的样了。
    可惜的是：台湾民航公司的飞机虽然没有“失踪”，台湾民用航空局的一架飞机却的确“失踪”，并且后来在大陆上发现了。
    美联社在韦大卫等起义事件发生以后曾经报道说，蒋贼空军当局承认，有人驾驶一架小型飞机“向大陆方向飞去”，这架飞机在“到达中国海岸以后就失踪了”。美联社还特别指出，“民用航空局”同“民航空运公司”是两个“毫无关系”的机构。“美国之音”的宣传是企图把牛头硬套在马嘴上，来遮掩事情的真相。但是韦大卫等起义的事实毕竟无法掩盖，而“美国之音”就又一次证明了它自己是说谎家。
    美国政府最近宣布要增加大批拨款来加强“美国之音”这类国际宣传机构。但是当“美国之音”只能用令人齿冷的谎言充当宣传资本的时候，美元又何济于事？  （江）
