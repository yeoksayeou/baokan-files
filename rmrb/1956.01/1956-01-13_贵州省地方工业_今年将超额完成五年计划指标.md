Guizhou Province's Local Industry
    Will Exceed Five-Year Plan Targets This Year

    (Our report) Guizhou Province's Industry Department and other relevant departments, after preliminary planning, have decided to exceed the targets stipulated in the Five-Year Plan in four years.

    By the end of 1956, the total output value of local industries in Guizhou Province can exceed the targets set by the Five-Year Plan. Among 22 products, the output of 19 kinds, including coal, iron, flour, cement, cotton cloth, cigarettes, edible vegetable oil, crude antimony, zinc, and coking coal, can reach or exceed the targets of the Five-Year Plan. Labor productivity and cost indicators can also be completed ahead of schedule.

    Industrial capital construction can also complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. The revised industrial capital construction plan for 1956 has doubled its investment compared to the original plan, and is 1.7 times larger than the estimated completion amount of the 1955 plan. The revised plan has added many construction units that directly serve agricultural production, such as the construction and renovation of two pesticide factories, ten agricultural implement factories, five granular fertilizer factories, and two phosphate fertilizer factories. The investment in these newly added construction units accounts for 30.8% of the total investment after the 1956 revision.

    贵州省地方工业
    今年将超额完成五年计划指标
    本报讯  贵州省工业厅等有关部门经过初步规划，决定四年超额完成五年计划规定的指标。
    到1956年末，贵州省地方工业总产值可以超过五年计划规定的指标。22种产品中，有煤、铁、面粉、水泥、棉布、卷烟、食用植物油、生锑、锌、焦煤等19种产量可以达到或超过五年计划的指标。劳动生产率和成本指标也可以提前完成。
    工业基本建设也可以提前一年完成五年计划。经过修改的1956年工业基本建设计划，它的投资额比原计划增加了一倍，比1955年计划预计完成数大1.7倍。在修改的计划中，增加了许多直接为农业生产服务的建设单位。如新建和改建两个农药厂、十个农具厂、五个颗粒肥料厂和两个磷肥厂。这些新增加的建设单位的投资，占1956年修正后总投资额的30.8％。
