Over One Thousand Days of Safe Production

To the Editor:

　　Since its establishment in March 1953, the Li Hannian tunneling team of the No. 2 pit of the Longyan Iron Mine has maintained safe production for over one thousand days without a single personal injury accident. When the team was first established, various forms of complacency existed among the workers. A common saying was: "Working with stones all day, how can you avoid getting hurt!" To address this mindset, the tunneling team established a safety officer and a half-shift meeting system. Each day, the team's safety officer would explain safety points and operating procedures at the half-shift meeting. Gradually, the workers realized that stones are inanimate, while people are alive. As long as they conduct regular inspections, remain vigilant at all times, and follow procedures, accidents can be completely avoided. Based on this improved understanding, the Li Hannian tunneling team further established various safety responsibility systems, strengthened each person's sense of responsibility, and eliminated chaotic phenomena in their work. In October of last year, worker He Wanshun began drilling without inspecting the roof, causing the roof to break and creating a risk of collapse. After the safety officer discovered this, work was stopped for inspection, and more than four tons of stone were pried down.

　　In the second half of 1954, the Li Hannian tunneling team encountered more than a dozen faults of varying sizes, the largest of which was 20 meters long. Working under these conditions made accidents very likely. They actively looked for solutions, erected temporary supports, and successfully navigated this challenge safely. In August 1955, when the Li Hannian team was tunneling eastward in the No. 6 level, more than 200 meters from the main roadway, they discovered another fault, 10 meters long with a broken roof. At the time, support workers were unavailable, and some workers advocated taking a risk. However, Li Hannian and others carefully studied the situation and ultimately used 17 temporary pillars to support the fault, enabling the work to be completed safely.

　　The Li Hannian tunneling team not only continuously achieved new records in safe production, but also completed the state tunneling plan 26 days ahead of schedule in 1955.

　　安全生产一千多天
　　编辑同志：
    龙烟铁矿二坑李汉年掘进组从1953年3月成立以来，坚持安全生产一千多天，没有发生过一次人身事故。这个组刚成立的时候，在工人中间也有着各种各样的麻痹思想，普遍流传的一种说法是：“成天和石头打交道，那能不伤人！”针对这种思想，掘进组建立了安全干事和半班会议制，每天由小组安全干事在半班会上讲解安全要点和操作规程，这样，工人逐渐认识到石头是死的，人是活的，只要经常检查，时刻警惕，按规程办事，事故是完全可以避免的。在提高思想认识的基础上，李汉年掘进组又进一步建立了各种安全责任制度，加强了每个人的责任心，消灭了工作中混乱现象。去年10月，工人何万顺没有检查顶板就打眼，造成顶板破碎，有塌陷的危险。安全干事发现后就停止工作，进行检查，结果撬下了四吨多石头。
    1954年下半年，李汉年掘进组遇到了十几个大小断层，其中最大的一个长达20公尺。在这种情况下工作，很容易发生事故。他们就积极想办法，支起了临时柱子，终于安全地渡过这一关。1955年8月，李汉年组在六平巷向东二百多公尺的大巷掘进的时候，又发现了一个十公尺长而顶板破碎的断层。当时找不到支柱工，个别工人就主张冒险干。但是李汉年等仔细地研究了情况，结果用17根临时柱子支住了断层，使工作安全地完成了。
    李汉年掘进组不但连续创造安全生产的新成绩，而且1955年还提前26天完成了国家掘进计划。　高树格　张金三
