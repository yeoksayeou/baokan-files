Advanced cooperatives can also be run quickly, numerously, and well
Li Jiping, Secretary of the Xingtai Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

In the Xingtai region of Hebei Province, the number of peasant households joining agricultural production cooperatives has reached 97.89% of the total number of peasant households. Currently, many elementary cooperatives in this region are further advancing towards complete socialist collectivization, with the number of peasant households joining advanced cooperatives reaching 80.6% of the total number of peasant households in the entire special district. It is expected that before the spring plowing, the number of peasant households joining advanced cooperatives in 9 counties can reach over 95% of the total number of peasant households. In addition, the number of peasant households joining advanced cooperatives in 8 other counties can reach 90% of the total number of peasant households.

Over the past few years, a large number of elementary agricultural cooperatives in the Xingtai region have demonstrated great superiority, increased farmers' incomes, and improved farmers' lives. However, if the elementary cooperatives do not continuously progress from small to large, from low to high, after a certain period, the contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production will seriously affect the full exertion of labor enthusiasm and the full utilization of the means of production. The contradictions are mainly manifested in: (1) Many poor cooperative members put in more labor days than some upper-middle peasant cooperative members, but their total income is less than that of the upper-middle peasants with more land. For example, Wu Jingshan, a poor cooperative member in Qianluzi Village, Xingtai, had a 58% higher attendance rate than Ren Long, a middle peasant; however, his family's average income per person was more than 54% lower than Ren Long's family's average income per person. At the same time, wealthy households gradually became less enthusiastic about labor as their land income increased. Li Zhenxi, an upper-middle peasant in Beixianxian Cooperative, Xingtai, said: "The land I get in a year is enough for me to sit and eat for two years. Since my ancestors left me a 'gold scraper' (land), why should I go to the fields and suffer!" In Shuimen, Qianluzi, Heinanao, Zhangcun and other cooperatives in Xingtai and Shahe counties, before the transition to advanced cooperatives, a few upper-middle peasants, supported by the idea of relying on land for food, refused to do "four things": cold weather, hot weather, heavy work, and dirty work. This not only hindered the further development of production, but also affected the unity of poor and middle peasants. (2) Private land ownership hinders the planned, unified, and rational use of land. Originally, with the establishment of elementary cooperatives, the land of the cooperative members should have been used in a unified way. However, the land is still privately owned, and the cooperative members still have the concept of private ownership of land. There will still be ideological obstacles to making relatively large changes in the terrain on the land. In Dalei East Village, Neiqiu, building a water dam can protect 120 mu of good land from disasters; however, because building the dam would occupy land, the cooperative members whose land would be occupied did not agree, so it could not be built. The Heinao Cooperative can save 10 full-time laborers by uniformly planning and building a good road for the use of large vehicles; however, no one wants the road to occupy their land. The planned area for mechanized farming in Jizhuang, Shahe was originally 400 mu, but because the land was scattered and there were many small roads, it could not be connected, so only 297 mu were farmed. (3) Private land and some other means of production must be given a certain reward every year, which hinders the accumulation of more public property.

These problems exposed in real life show that the collectivization movement in our region has developed to a new stage, and has put forward new requirements for the leadership: it is necessary to more actively and systematically lead the peasants to further unite, merge the smaller elementary cooperatives, abolish land remuneration, change the private ownership of land and other major means of production to collective ownership, and transform the elementary cooperatives into advanced cooperatives. This is the active demand of the vast majority of cooperative members in our region at present, and it is also a practical need to further develop production.

According to the law of the development of the movement, our strength and experience, the socialist consciousness and demands of the broad masses of peasants, and the conditions for a large number of advanced cooperatives to be established have matured in our region. In 1955, 91% of the 6,641 old cooperatives established increased production by 10% to 70%, and about 2,000 of them increased production by more than 100% compared with before the establishment of the cooperatives. The vast majority of cooperative members have recognized that increased production is the result of collective labor. Over the past 4 years, general cooperatives have accumulated public property and carried out basic construction, and about 90% of the cooperatives have already collectively owned livestock, large farm tools, etc. at a discounted price. The vast majority of cooperative members have established the collectivist idea of taking the cooperative as their home. In terms of production management, the contract work system and the piece-rate system have been generally implemented, and 773 cooperatives have adopted the overproduction reward system. The idea that "the more you work, the better, and the higher the reward" has taken root in the hearts of the people. In the cooperative movement over the past few years, more than 10,000 capable and fair grassroots cadres who can lead relatively large-scale production have been trained. Experience has proved that with these conditions, it is possible to lead the broad masses of cooperative members to run advanced cooperatives well. In mechanized farming areas, places with sparse populations, or areas where the average number of labor force and land per household is not very different, as long as the masses are completely voluntary and the leading backbone is strong, advanced cooperatives can be run well directly without going through the elementary cooperative stage.

As early as the spring of 1954, the Xingtai Prefectural Committee test-established two advanced cooperatives in Shuimen, Xingtai, and Zhangcun, Shahe; in 1955, it test-established two advanced cooperatives in Heinao, Shahe, and Sandaoling. The results of the pilot projects of the four advanced cooperatives fully proved that advanced cooperatives have greater advantages in all aspects. Before the establishment of the cooperative in Zhangcun, women did not work in the fields; after the establishment of the elementary cooperative, only a dozen people participated in production, and they were not regular; after the transition to an advanced cooperative in 1954, all 69 female laborers in the village participated in labor, which played a significant role in increasing production in the cooperative. After the establishment of the advanced cooperative in Heinao Village, the labor potential was brought into play, and not only did they overcome the drought in more than 100 days without rain, but also increased the total income by more than 7% compared with 1954; in addition, they also completed basic construction projects that could not be completed in the past, such as road construction and drought pond construction. In these four cooperatives, except for a few special cases of old, weak, widowed, and orphaned households whose income was reduced and were taken care of by the cooperative, the income of general cooperative members increased.

The superiority shown by the original advanced cooperatives has made the broad masses of peasants deeply realize that: the more the cooperative advances, the greater the superiority, and the happier the people's lives. Therefore, the enthusiasm of cooperative members in various parts of the region to transfer to advanced cooperatives is generally high, and a new upsurge has been formed. At the meeting on the transfer to advanced cooperatives convened by the Prefectural Committee, the original notice required 29 people to come from Ren County, but actually 43 people came; in addition, there were 26 other people who wanted to come. The Xingtai County Committee asked the Tianjiazhuang Cooperative to bring a meeting notice to the Machanggou Cooperative, but the Tianjiazhuang Cooperative did not send it, and they came to the meeting themselves with that notice. Everyone unanimously asked the leadership to let go.

Along with the upsurge of transferring to advanced cooperatives, a new upsurge of agricultural production increase has appeared in the whole region. The 1956 production plan formulated by Baixiang County requires that the yield of grain per mu should reach 1,400 jin, and the yield of seed cotton per mu should reach 1,150 jin. In 1956, 129 "thousand-jin high-yield townships" will appear in the entire special district. According to the statistics of 453 advanced cooperatives in early January: since the preparation for the transfer to advanced cooperatives, 61,850 carts of fertilizer have been accumulated, 861 wells have been dug, 164 canals have been opened, 6,638 mu of ditches and terraced fields have been repaired, 5,185 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, 2,944 mu of terraced fields have been built, 3,488 mu of beach land have been reclaimed, and 1,062 roads have been merged. Practice has proved that after the abolition of land private ownership, the productive forces are completely liberated, and the labor productivity is greatly improved. These facts have educated a wider range of masses, and have enhanced the confidence of leaders at all levels and grassroots workers in running advanced cooperatives well. The Party committees at all levels in our region are full of confidence and are striving for the rapid and healthy development of advanced collectivization and the realization of greater production increase tasks.

    高级社也可以办得又快又多又好
    中共邢台地委书记　李吉平
    河北省邢台地区加入农业生产合作社的农户，已经达到总农户的97.89％。现在，这个地区的许多初级社正在进一步向完全社会主义的合作化前进，全专区加入高级社的农户已经达到总农户的80.6％。预计春耕前9个县加入高级社的农户可以达到总农户的95％以上。另外8个县加入高级社的农户可以达到总农户的90％。
    几年来，邢台地区的大批初级农业合作社显示了很大的优越性，增加了农民的收入，改善了农民的生活。但是，初级社如果不由小到大、由低到高不断前进，到了一定时期，生产力和生产关系的矛盾就会严重地影响劳动积极性的充分发挥和生产资料的充分利用。矛盾主要表现在：（一）很多贫苦社员比一些上中农社员多做劳动日，总收入却少于土地多的上中农。如邢台前炉子村贫苦社员武景山，比中农任龙的出工率高58％；但是他全家每人的平均收入比任龙家每人平均收入低54％还多。同时，富裕户随着土地收入的增多，劳动态度逐渐消极下来。邢台北先贤社上中农李振西说：“我土地一年分的够两年坐着吃。既然先人给留下了刮金板（土地），何必下地吃苦哩！”邢台、沙河两县的水门、前炉子、黑碯、章村等社，在转高级社以前，少数上中农，在依靠土地吃饭的思想支持下，天冷、天热、重活、脏活“四不干”。这不但妨碍生产的进一步发展，并且影响了贫农、中农的团结。（二）土地私有妨碍了对土地有计划的统一的合理的使用。本来，办了初级社就应该可以统一使用社员的土地了。但是，土地仍然是私有的，社员对土地仍有私有的观念，要在土地上比较大地改变地形还是会碰到思想障碍。内邱大垒东村修一道挡水坝，可使120亩好地不受灾；但是，因为修坝要占地，地被占的社员思想不通，就不能修筑。黑碯社统一规划修好大道利用大车，可以节省10个整劳力；但是，谁也不愿让大道占自己的土地。沙河冀庄机耕区原计划耕400亩，因地块分散和小道多，不能连片，只耕了297亩。（三）私有的土地和别的一些生产资料每年要分得一定的报酬，妨碍更多地积累公共财产。
    实际生活中暴露出来的这些问题，说明了我区合作化运动已经发展到了一个新的阶段，对领导方面提出了新的要求：必须更积极地有计划地领导农民进一步联合起来，把规模较小的初级社合并起来，取消土地报酬，改变土地和别的主要生产资料的私有制度为集体所有制度，把初级社转变成高级社。这是当前我区绝大多数社员的积极要求，也是进一步发展生产的实际需要。
    根据运动发展的规律，我们的力量和经验，广大农民的社会主义觉悟和要求，大量转办高级社的条件在我区已经成熟。1955年所办的6，641个老社，增产1至7成的占91％，较建社前增产一倍以上的约有2，000个。绝大部分社员都已认清：增产是集体劳动的结果。4年以来，一般社都积累了公共财产，进行了基本建设，90％左右的社已经把牲口、大农具等折价归社内集体所有。绝大部分社员已经树立了以社为家的集体主义思想。在生产管理方面，已经普遍地实行了包工制和按件记工制，有773个社采用了超产奖励制。“劳动得越多越好，得到的报酬也就越高”的观念已经深入人心。在几年的合作化运动中，已经培养了能够领导比较大规模的生产的、公道能干的基层干部1万多名。经验证明，具备了这些条件，是可以领导广大社员办好高级社的。在机耕区，地广人稀的地方，或者各户劳力和土地的平均数相差不多的地区，只要群众完全自愿和领导骨干坚强，不经过初级社的阶段，直接办高级社也可以办好。
    邢台地委早在1954年春季就在邢台水门、沙河章村试办了两个高级社；1955年又在沙河黑碯和三道岭试办了两个高级社。4个高级社的试办结果，完全证明了高级社在各方面有更大的优越性。章村在建社以前，妇女不下地生产；建初级社后，只有十来个人参加生产，也还不经常；1954年转为高级社以后，全村69个妇女劳力都参加了劳动，对社内的增产起了重大的作用。黑碯村建立高级社以后，劳动潜力发挥出来了，不仅在100多天不下雨的情况下战胜了旱灾，而且还比1954年的总收入增加了7％还多；此外，还完成了修路、打旱池等过去无法完成的基本建设工程。在这4个社里，除个别特殊情况的老弱孤寡户因为收入减少由社内照顾以外，一般社员都增加了收入。
    原有的高级社显示出来的优越性，使广大农民深深体会到：合作社越前进，优越性也越大，人民的生活也越幸福。因此，全区各地社员要求转办高级社的情绪普遍高涨，已经形成了一个新的高潮。地委召开的转高级社会议，原通知任县来29人，实际上来了43人；另外还有26个人要来。邢台县委要田家庄社给马场沟社捎的开会通知，田家庄社没有送，他们自己带着那份通知来开会了。大家在会上一致要求领导方面放手。
    随着转高级社的高潮，在全区出现了农业增产的新高潮。柏乡县制定的1956年生产计划，粮食每亩产量要达到1，400斤，籽棉每亩产量要达到1，150斤。全专区1956年将出现129个“千斤丰产乡”。据1月初453个高级社统计：自酝酿转办高级社以来，已经积肥61，850车，打井861眼，开渠164道，修沟洫畦田6，638亩，开荒5，185亩，修梯田2，944亩，滩地3，488亩，合并道路1，062条。实践证明，废除土地私有制以后，生产力彻底得到解放，劳动生产率大大提高。这些事实，教育了更广大的群众，并且增强了各级领导人员和基层工作人员办好高级社的信心。我区各级党委都满怀信心，为高级合作化的迅速的健康的发展和实现更大的增产任务而奋斗。
