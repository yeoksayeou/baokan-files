    People Who Have Completed Five Years' Work Ahead of Schedule
    Lu Shenghe, a young milling machine operator at the Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Factory, had already completed his personal workload for the first Five-Year Plan period by early December of last year. He is currently working on production for 1958. Since 1953, more than 50 of his rationalization proposals have been adopted and implemented, resulting in an average increase in work efficiency of 30% to 50%. For several years, the quality of products produced by Lu Shenghe has met standards.
    Zhan Shuijing and Liu Hanshan, both lathe operators at the Dalian Shipbuilding Company, completed five years' worth of work in three years. Zhan Shuijing has not produced any defective products for more than eight consecutive years. In the past three years, Liu Hanshan has improved 15 kinds of tools and created five fixtures, increasing production efficiency by one to five times.
      On January 9, Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande, outstanding young lathe operators at the Dalian Shipbuilding Company, completed five years' worth of work ahead of schedule. They have exceeded their production quotas every year for the past three years. Now, they have proposed to complete 20 months' worth of work this year.
    Gao Jixiang, a young lathe operator at the Jinan Locomotive Repair Factory, completed five years' worth of work by January 11. Since 1953, he has learned five advanced Soviet experiences, proposed and implemented 27 rationalization proposals, and improved more than 40 large and small tools. Now he has proposed a plan to complete 23.5 months' worth of work this year.

    大连造船公司车工詹水晶和刘汉山都在三年的时间里完成了五年的工作量。詹水晶连续八年多没有出过废品。刘汉山在过去三年里改进了15种刀具，创造了五件胎具，使生产效率提高了一倍到五倍。
      1月9日，大连造船公司优秀青年车工朱维勤和张连德提前完成了五年的工作量。他们在过去的三年里，年年都超过生产定额。现在，他们又提出要在今年内完成20个月的工作量。
