Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The socialist transformation of rural private merchants nationwide is nearing its climax. To date, the socialist transformation of rural private merchants has been basically completed in the suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin. In Henan Province, more than 60% of rural private merchants have been incorporated into various forms of transformation. In Jiangsu, Guizhou and other provinces, about half of the rural private merchants have already undergone transformation. Henan, Heilongjiang, Anhui and other provinces can basically complete the semi-socialist transformation of rural private merchants in the first quarter or around the Spring Festival. Large numbers of cadres trained in Liaoning, Shaanxi and other provinces have successively gone deep into grassroots units to carry out the transformation of rural private merchants. In Hunan, Shanxi and other provinces, Communist Party organizations and supply and marketing cooperatives above the county level have established leading groups and offices for the transformation of private merchants. Many regions have also promoted relevant transformation policies to rural private merchants and their families through merchants' congresses, symposiums for families of private merchants, and other means.

The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives recently issued an urgent directive, requiring all localities to seize the leadership and actively organize forces to accelerate the transformation of rural private merchants, in accordance with the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical," in order to adapt to the development of the agricultural collectivization movement and the socialist enthusiasm of the vast number of rural private merchants.

    全国农村私商社会主义改造临近高潮
    新华社20日讯　全国农村私商的社会主义改造临近高潮。到目前为止，北京、天津两市郊区已经基本上完成对农村私商的社会主义改造。河南省纳入各种改造形式的农村私商，已经超过60％。江苏、贵州等省已经有一半左右的农村私商经过改造。河南、黑龙江、安徽等省在第一季度内或春节前后就可以基本完成农村私商的半社会主义改造工作。辽宁、陕西等省训练的大批干部，已经先后深入基层单位，进行农村私商改造工作。在湖南、山西等省，县以上的中共各级组织和供销合作社，都成立了私商改造工作领导小组和私商改造办公室。许多地区还通过商民大会、私商家属座谈会等，向农村私商和他们的家属宣传有关改造的政策。
    中华全国供销合作总社在最近发出紧急指示，要求各地根据又多、又快、又好的精神，抓紧领导，积极组织力量，对农村私商加快进行改造，以适应农业合作化运动的发展和广大农村私商的社会主义积极性。
