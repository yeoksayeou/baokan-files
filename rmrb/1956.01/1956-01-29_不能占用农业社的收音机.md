To the Editor:

    The radios distributed by the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture through the Provincial People's Broadcasting Station to the radio stations of agricultural production cooperatives have been occupied by staff members of the Nanzheng County Construction Section. Some have been installed in the joint offices of the County People's Committee and the Construction Section office, and some have even been installed in the staff members' dormitories. At the same time, they do not take care of the radios, and some machines have been damaged.

    After the Propaganda Department of the Nanzheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this situation, it raised objections to the office of the County People's Committee and the Construction Section, but this did not attract their attention. It is recommended that the relevant leading organs of Nanzheng County correct this erroneous practice.

    不能占用农业社的收音机编辑同志：
    陕西省农业厅委托省人民广播电台配发给农业生产合作社收音站的收音机，被南郑县建设科工作人员占用了，有的安在县人民委员会联合办公室和建设科办公室，有的甚至安到了工作人员的宿舍里。同时，他们对收音机还不加爱护，有些机子已经被弄坏了。
    中共南郑县委宣传部发现这种情况以后，向县人民委员会办公室和建设科提出意见，但是并没有引起他们的重视。建议南郑县有关领导机关纠正这种错误做法。
