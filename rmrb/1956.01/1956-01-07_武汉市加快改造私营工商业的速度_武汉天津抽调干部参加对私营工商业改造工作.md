Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 6th: Wuhan City will complete the joint state-private ownership transformation of private industry in the first half of this year, ahead of schedule. The joint state-private ownership and reorganization of private commerce will also be basically completed this year, almost a year earlier than originally planned. This decision was made by relevant leading departments in Wuhan City based on the enthusiastic applications for joint state-private ownership from industrialists and businessmen, and to meet the needs of the great development of agricultural cooperativization and the accelerated pace of industrial construction.

So far, 45 private industrial sectors in Wuhan City have applied to the government for joint state-private ownership of their entire industry. Among them, 11 sectors, including weaving, confectionery, and batteries, have been approved by the government. In private commerce, in addition to silk and cloth, new medicines, and Hunan embroidery, which have already formally implemented joint state-private ownership of their entire industry, five sectors, including tea, photography, and catering, have also submitted applications. All private grain stores in the city and 19 joint pork stall groups in the Wuchang district have recently been reorganized into state-owned grain stores and state-owned meat retail groups, respectively. Seven industrial specialized companies and two commercial specialized companies have been established throughout the city.

Xinhua News Agency, January 6th: Wuhan and Tianjin are transferring a large number of cadres, after short-term training, to participate in the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

The first batch of more than 340 cadres transferred by the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China have been successively dispatched to the nine newly established industrial and commercial specialized companies around New Year's Day. Some have already taken leadership positions in various joint state-private factories and stores. The Second and Third Commercial Bureaus of Tianjin City have also transferred more than 2,000 cadres from state-owned specialized companies to participate in the socialist transformation of private commerce. Most of the cadres assigned to industries such as pastries, cotton cloth, and new medicines have assumed positions such as managers of the city's general store or district general store in these industries.

　　武汉市加快改造私营工商业的速度
    武汉天津抽调干部参加对私营工商业改造工作
    据新华社武汉6日电　武汉市私营工业的公私合营工作，将在今年上半年内提前完成。私营商业的公私合营、改组工作也将在今年内基本完成，比原来规划要求的时间提前了将近一年。这是武汉市有关领导部门根据工商业者积极申请公私合营的情况，同时为了适应农业合作化大发展和工业建设速度加快的需要而决定的。
    到目前为止，武汉市现有的私营工业已经有45个行业向政府提出全行业公私合营的申请。其中织布、糖果、电池等11个行业已经得到政府的批准。私营商业除了绸布、新药、湘绣三个行业已经正式实行全行业公私合营以外，茶业、照相、饮食等五个行业也提出了申请；全市私营粮食店和武昌区的19个猪肉摊贩联营组，都已经在最近分别改组为国营粮食店和国营肉食品零售组。全市已成立七个工业专业公司和两个商业专业公司。
    据新华社6日讯　武汉市和天津市抽调大批干部，经过短期训练，参加对私营工商业的社会主义改造工作。
    中共武汉市委员会第一批抽调的340多名干部，已经在元旦前后陆续派到九个新成立的工业和商业专业公司，有的已经到各公私合营厂、店担任了领导工作。天津市第二商业局和第三商业局也从国营专业公司抽调了二千多名干部，投入私营商业的社会主义改造工作。被派到糕点、棉布、新药等行业的干部，大部分担任了这些行业的市总店或区总店的经理等职务。
