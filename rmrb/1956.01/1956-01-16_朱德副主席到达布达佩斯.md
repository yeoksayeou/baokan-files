He said, "Dear guests, your visit to Hungary has aroused the sincere welcome of all Hungarian people and has given them great encouragement. The Hungarian people have watched with deep sympathy the historic events of the Chinese people striving for freedom and establishing a people's regime under the leadership of the Communist Party. Our people are as happy for the achievements of the great Chinese people in consolidating the people's democratic system and socialist construction since liberation as they are for their own achievements. We highly appreciate the unremitting and consistent struggle of the Chinese people, together with the great Soviet people and peace-loving people all over the world, to ease international tensions and to strive for peace in Asia and the world, and for the progress of mankind. The outstanding achievement of these struggles is that the principles of peaceful coexistence are increasingly supported among Asian and African countries."

He first conveyed the warm respect of the Chinese people to the fraternal Hungarian people. He said that under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party headed by Comrade Rakosi, and with the help and support of the great Soviet Union and other fraternal people's democratic countries, the hardworking and brave Hungarian people have successfully completed the first Five-Year Plan for laying the foundation of the socialist economy, enabling your country to achieve great progress in various aspects such as economy and culture in a relatively short period of time. The Chinese people express their great admiration and encouragement for all these great achievements you have made.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said that there is a deep friendship between the Chinese people and the Hungarian people. In the big family of the peace, democracy and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union, the mutual assistance and cooperation between our two peoples in economic, cultural, scientific and technological fields, as well as in jointly related international activities, will be developed and expanded more comprehensively.

Afterwards, Vice Chairman Zhu De, accompanied by Rakosi and Hegedüs, reviewed the guard of honor and walked past the crowd. At this time, the crowd constantly cheered "Zhu De—Rakosi!"
