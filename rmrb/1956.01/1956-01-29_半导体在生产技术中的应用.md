Application of Semiconductors in Production Technology
Tang Dingyuan, Associate Researcher, Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

In the past two or three decades, two sciences of particularly significant importance have developed in physics. One is the well-known nuclear physics, and the other is semiconductor physics. Although semiconductor physics is not as widely known as nuclear physics, its applications have penetrated into various technical departments and have caused significant reforms within them.

The important development of semiconductors began during World War II. At that time, due to the military need for radio positioning technology, silicon (Si) detectors and germanium detectors were discovered. Germanium and silicon are two typical semiconductor materials. Since then, the research on the basic properties of germanium and silicon has become one of the main problems in laboratories. After the war, germanium rectifiers and amplifiers were invented. Currently, germanium and silicon can be used to manufacture rectifiers, detectors, and amplifiers with good performance. Their function is equivalent to diode or triode vacuum tubes.

As everyone knows, electronics occupies such an important position in modern production technology. The most important component in electronic instruments is the vacuum tube. Compared with vacuum tubes, semiconductor instruments have unparalleled advantages: they are small in size; they have no glass tubes and are not easily damaged; the working life is almost infinite; there is no filament that needs to be heated, so power consumption is very low; in addition, they can be mass-produced and are inexpensive. All these advantages make it possible to gradually replace vacuum tubes.

Electronic computers are the most powerful tools in modern engineering, capable of completing a huge number of numerical calculations in fractions of a second. Such computers sometimes use hundreds, thousands, or even more vacuum tubes. Replacing vacuum tubes with germanium or silicon instruments can increase the working life of the computer and greatly simplify its structure.

Production automation is of extreme importance in the national economy. Modern automatic control equipment uses dozens of complex electronic relays. If semiconductor instruments are used instead, the equipment will be greatly simplified. Therefore, there is no doubt that future automation must be based on the use of semiconductors.

Radio broadcasting is an indispensable part of cultural education. If semiconductor instruments are used to manufacture radio receivers, we can obtain radios that have a long life, are not easily damaged, consume very little power, and are very inexpensive. This kind of radio can be widely used in vast rural areas without the problem of power supply difficulties. From an economic point of view, this may be more advantageous than developing wired broadcasting.

Semiconductor electronic instruments are of particular importance in communications, especially military communications. Because the use of semiconductor instruments will make communication equipment very lightweight, and it can save the huge power supply equipment and institutions.

The working efficiency of germanium and silicon rectifiers reaches 98%. Compared with DC generators of the same power, their volume is incomparably small. For example, a silicon rectifier that can accommodate 20 amps is smaller than a grain of rice. Therefore, these rectifiers can completely replace DC motors. The invention of these rectifiers has solved some important problems in long-distance power transmission engineering.

Amazing achievements have also been made in the research of semiconductor thermoelectricity. If two different conductors are connected into a closed circuit, and there is a temperature difference between the two junctions, current will flow through the circuit, which is called thermoelectricity (electricity generated due to temperature difference). This phenomenon has been known for more than 130 years. But in the past, thermoelectric couples were made of metal or alloys, and their working efficiency was very low, so they could not be used for power generation. The working efficiency of thermoelectric couples made of semiconductors can reach 6% to 8%, but this is still far from the limit value. In terms of efficiency, it is likely to exceed the efficiency of heat engines, which is 10%, in the future. On the other hand, its structure is simpler than that of ordinary heat engines. It does not need any steam boilers, nor machines and generators with rotating parts, and it can directly convert heat energy into electrical energy.

The first practical application of semiconductor thermoelectricity is the Soviet-made TΓK-3 small generator. It uses a kerosene lamp as a heat source. The hot air generated at the top of the kerosene lamp flows upward inside the glass cover, heating one junction of the thermoelectric generator, while the other junction of the motor maintains the same temperature as the surrounding air. The electricity generated by this temperature difference is enough to supply a radio. And the heat energy it consumes is actually a part of the energy that is not utilized when using a kerosene lamp, and the kerosene lamp can still be used for lighting. This kind of small generator can be used in all areas where electricity cannot reach, such as the vast rural areas and the remote mountains and wild areas where geological survey teams go, ensuring that these areas can listen to broadcasts or send and receive telegrams.

But the use of semiconductor thermoelectricity is by no means limited to this. Thermoelectric generators with greater power and greater efficiency will be gradually manufactured, and will cause fundamental reforms in power engineering in the future.

Contrary to the thermoelectric generation effect, if current is passed through the above-mentioned circuit, one of its junctions can be cooled and the other junction can be heated. Using this phenomenon, coolers can be manufactured. Coolers made of semiconductors can lower the temperature by 60 degrees or even more, and their structure is simple, the lifespan is almost infinite, and the power consumption is relatively low. This achievement provides a new direction for the refrigeration industry.

Semiconductors have such great uses, so now let's talk about what a semiconductor is. Metals have a great ability to conduct electricity, so they are called "conductors"; insulators cannot conduct electricity, so they are called "insulators"; semiconductors are exactly materials between the two, their ability to conduct electricity is not as great as metals, but it is not as small as insulators, so they are called "semiconductors." At the same time, the electrical conductivity of semiconductors is also affected by the outside world. For example, heating can cause great changes in their electrical conductivity.

The so-called thermistor is manufactured based on this property. Thermistors can be used to measure temperature or control temperature. In electronic circuits, thermistors are commonly used automatic control components. Thermistors can also be made very small, only a fraction of a millimeter, and are used in biology and agriculture to measure the temperature of leaves and animals.

In addition to heating, light irradiation can also change the electrical conductivity of semiconductors. Photoresistors (a type of photocell) are manufactured based on this principle. Photoresistors are important components in automatic control and measuring instruments, and are widely used. Some photoresistors are not only sensitive to visible light, but also can sense infrared light emitted by slightly heated objects. Their sensitivity is very high and they can detect hot objects dozens of kilometers away. Obviously, this performance is of great significance in the military.

Solar cells are also a type of semiconductor photocell. Solar cells can be used to directly convert the energy of sunlight into electrical energy. Currently, the working efficiency of solar cells made of silicon has reached 10%. This is a large number. If the area of the solar cell is made into one square kilometer, we can directly obtain 100,000 kilowatts of electrical energy. At present, the manufacturing method of silicon solar cells is still very complex and cannot be mass-produced. But there is no doubt that these difficulties can be overcome, and in the near future, humans will be able to directly utilize solar energy on a large scale.

The application of semiconductors currently involves all departments of production technology. Therefore, scientifically advanced countries are using the greatest strength to develop semiconductor research. We should also use the greatest strength to catch up and make semiconductors serve our country's construction cause.

    半导体在生产技术中的应用
    中国科学院应用物理研究所副研究员　汤定元
    最近二、三十年内，物理学中发展了两门具有特别重大意义的科学，一门是人所共知的原子核物理学，另一门就是半导体物理学。半导体物理学虽然还没有像原子核物理那样普遍地为人们所知道，但是它的应用已经深入到各个技术部门，并且在其中引起了重大的改革。
    半导体的重要的发展开始在第二次世界大战期间。当时由于军事上对于无线电定位术的需要，发现了硅（矽）检波器和锗检波器。锗和硅就是两种典型的半导体材料。从此以后锗和硅的基本性能的研究成为实验室中的主要问题之一。大战以后，又发明了锗整流器和放大器。目前已经能够用锗和硅制出性能良好的整流器、检波器和放大器。它们的作用相当于二极或三极真空管。
    大家知道，电子学在现代生产技术中占据多么重要的地位。而电子学仪器中的最重要的元件就是真空管。比起真空管来，半导体仪器有着无上的优点：它的体积小；它没有玻璃管，不易损坏；工作寿命几乎是无限长；没有需要加热的灯丝，因此耗电很少；此外它可以大量制造，成本便宜。所有这些优点，使它有可能逐步地代替真空管。
    电子计算机是近代工程上的最强有力的工具，它能在几分之一秒内完成巨大数目的数值计算。在这种计算机中有时用了几百几千个甚至更多的真空管。以锗或硅的仪器来代替真空管可以增加计算机的工作寿命，同时大大简化它的结构。
    生产自动化在国民经济中具有极端重要的意义。现代的自动控制设备中用了几十个复杂的电子继电器。如果用半导体仪器来代替，设备将大为简化。因此毫无疑问，将来的自动化一定要建立在利用半导体的基础上。
    无线广播是文化教育中不可缺少的东西。如果用半导体仪器来制造无线电收音机，我们就可以得到寿命长、不易损坏、用电很省、成本很便宜的收音机。这种收音机可以在广大的农村中普遍使用，不至于有供电困难的问题。在经济原则上讲，这可能比发展有线广播更为有利。
    半导体的电子学仪器在通讯方面，特别是军事通讯方面，具有特别重要的意义。因为半导体仪器的使用将使通话设备变得很轻便，而且可以省掉庞大的电源供应的设备和机构。
    锗和硅的整流器的工作效率达98％，和同样功率的直流发电机相比，它们的体积之小简直是无法比拟的。例如一个能容纳20安培的硅整流器，它的体积比一粒米还要小。所以完全可以用这些整流器来代替直流电机。这些整流器的发明使得远距离送电工程中的一些重要问题得到解决。
    关于半导体的温差电的研究也得到了惊人的成就。把两个不同导体接成闭合线路，如果两个接头上有温度差存在，线路内就有电流通过，这就叫做温差电（因有温度差而产生了电）。这一现象早在130多年前就已经知道了。但过去的温差电偶都是用金属或合金做的，它的工作效率很低，不能用来发电。半导体做的温差电偶的工作效率可达到6％到8％，但这离极限值还很远，在效率方面将来很可能超过工作效率为10％的热机。而在另一方面，它的结构又比一般热机的构造简单得无可比拟。它不需要任何蒸汽锅炉，不需要带有转动部分的机器和发电机，就能直接把热能转变成电能。
    半导体温差电的第一个实际应用是苏联制的TΓK—3型的小发电机。它用煤油灯做热源。煤油灯头上所产生的热空气在玻璃罩内向上流，使温差发电机的一个接头得到加热，而电机的另一接头则保持着和四周空气相同的温度。因这一温度差所产生的电足够供给收音机之用。而它所消耗的热能实际上是通常使用煤油灯的时候所没有利用的一部分能量，煤油灯仍旧可以作照明之用。这样的小发电机可以用在一切电力不能达到的地区，例如广大的农村以及地质勘测队所到的荒山僻野，保证这些地区能够收听广播或收发电讯。
    但是半导体温差电的用处决不止于此。功率更大、效率更大的温差发电机会逐步制造出来，将来会在动力工程中引起根本的改革。
    和温差发电的效应相反，如果用电流通过上面所说的线路，就可以使它的一个接头变冷，另一个接头变热。利用这个现象就可以制造致冷器。用半导体做的致冷器可以降低温度60度甚至更多，而且它的结构简单，寿命几乎是无限长，电能的消耗也比较省。这一成就为致冷机工业提供了新的方向。
    半导体既有这么大的用途，现在我们就来说一说什么叫做半导体。金属传导电的本领很大，所以叫做“导体”；绝缘体是不能传导电的，所以叫做“绝缘体”；半导体正好就是介于两者之间的材料，它的导电的本领没有金属那么大，但是也不像绝缘体那么小，所以把它叫做“半导体”。同时，半导体的导电本领还受外界的影响，例如加热可以使它的导电本领发生很大的变化。
    所谓热敏电阻就是根据这一性质制造出来的。用热敏电阻可以测量温度，也可以控制温度。在电子学线路中，热敏电阻是用得很普遍的自动控制的元件。热敏电阻还可以做得非常小，只有几分之一毫米，在生物学和农业上用来测量叶子和动物的温度。
    除掉加热外，光的照射也能改变半导体的导电本领。光敏电阻（光电管的一种）就是根据这个道理制造出来的。光敏电阻是自动控制和测量仪器中的重要元件，用得很普遍。有些光敏电阻除对可见光有敏感性外，还能感受到稍为加了热的物体所发出的红外光，它的灵敏度很大，能探测到几十公里以外的热物体，显然这一性能在军事上有很大的意义。
    光电池也是一种半导体制的光电管，利用光电池可以把太阳光的能量直接变成电能。目前用硅制成的光电池的工作效率已经达到10％。这是一个很大的数字，如果光电池的面积做成一平方公里，我们就可以直接得到10万瓩的电能。目前硅光电池的制造方法还很复杂，不能大量制造。但毫无疑义，这些困难是可能克服的，不久的将来人类就能够大规模地直接利用太阳能。
    半导体的应用在目前已经牵涉到生产技术的各部门。所以科学先进的国家都用最大的力量来发展半导体的研究工作。我们也应当用最大的力量来迎头赶上，使半导体为我们国家的建设事业服务。
