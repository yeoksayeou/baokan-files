　　Instructions from the State Council on Changing Local National Democratic United Governments

    In the early days of the People's Republic of China, in order to guarantee the rights of minority nationalities to participate in local people's governments at all levels, some regions established local national democratic united governments in accordance with the "Decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the Implementation of Local National Democratic United Governments." This was necessary at the time. After several years of implementing the policy of national equality, all nationalities have appropriate representation in local people's governments at all levels in areas with minority nationalities. After the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the rights of minority nationalities to participate in local people's congresses and local people's committees at all levels have been fully guaranteed. Therefore, according to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the local national democratic united governments established in the past should be changed. The following are instructions on the method of change:

    (1) Counties and townships that have established national democratic united governments in the past should be reorganized into autonomous counties and ethnic townships if they are suitable for establishing autonomous counties and ethnic townships according to the provisions of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. If they are not suitable for establishing autonomous counties and ethnic townships, they should be changed to general counties and townships in accordance with the provisions of the Organic Law of the People's Republic of China on Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees at All Levels.

    (2) Prefectures and districts that have established national democratic united governments in the past should be reorganized into autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties if they are suitable for establishing autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties according to the provisions of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. If they are not suitable for establishing autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties, the national democratic united governments of the prefectures and districts should be changed to commissioner's offices and district offices as dispatched agencies of the provincial and county people's committees.

    (3) When local national democratic united governments at all levels are changed to general counties and townships, as well as commissioner's offices and district offices, full attention should be paid to the local national characteristics in their work. The minority nationality personnel originally responsible for leading the work should be retained in leadership positions.

    (4) All localities should fully consult with the representatives of local nationalities on the issue of changing local national democratic united governments at all levels, and they must do a good job in personnel arrangements and publicity and explanation work, and prevent any simplistic and rash practices.

    The people's committees of all relevant provinces and autonomous regions should formulate specific plans for changing local national democratic united governments in accordance with the above methods and in combination with the specific local conditions, and report them to the State Council for approval before implementation. The time for changing local national democratic united governments shall be determined by the provinces and autonomous regions according to the specific circumstances, but it should not be later than the end of 1956 at the latest.

              Premier Zhou Enlai
                December 29, 1955

　　国务院关于改变地方民族民主联合政府的指示
    中华人民共和国建立初期，为保障少数民族参加地方各级人民政府的权利，若干地区根据“中央人民政府政务院关于地方民族民主联合政府实施办法的决定”，建立了地方民族民主联合政府，这在当时是必要的，经过几年来民族平等政策的贯彻，凡在区域内有少数民族的地方各级人民政府中，各民族都有了适当的代表名额。中华人民共和国宪法公布后，少数民族参加地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会的权利更得到了充分保障。因此，根据中华人民共和国宪法，过去建立的地方民族民主联合政府应予改变。现将改变办法指示如下：
    （一）对于过去建立民族民主联合政府的县和乡，应该根据中华人民共和国宪法规定，适合建立自治县和民族乡的，改建自治县和民族乡；不适合建立自治县和民族乡的，应该依照中华人民共和国地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法的规定，改为一般县和乡。
    （二）对于过去建立民族民主联合政府的专区和区，应该根据中华人民共和国宪法规定，适合建立自治州和自治县的，改建自治州和自治县；不适合建立自治州和自治县的，应该将专区和区的民族民主联合政府改为专员公署和区公所，作为省和县人民委员会的派出机关。
    （三）凡地方各级民族民主联合政府改为一般县和乡以及专员公署和区公所的，应该在工作中充分注意当地民族特点。对于原来负责领导工作的少数民族人员应该留任领导工作。
    （四）各地对改变地方各级民族民主联合政府的问题，应该同当地民族的代表充分协商，并且必须作好人事安排和宣传解释工作，防止任何简单急躁的作法。
    各有关省、自治区人民委员会应该根据上述办法，并且结合当地具体情况订出改变地方民族民主联合政府的具体计划，报告国务院批准后实行。改变地方民族民主联合政府的时间，由各省、自治区按照具体情况决定，但是最迟不应该迟于1956年年底。
              总理　周恩来
                1955年12月29日
