Oppose Dulles' Interference in Jordan's Internal Affairs
Cui Qi

On January 8th, just as the patriotic struggle of the Jordanian people against the Baghdad Pact continued to surge, US Secretary of State Dulles suddenly summoned the Jordanian Chargé d'Affaires to the United States, Tuqan, and issued a "strong protest" to Jordan. He openly demanded "explanations" for the anti-American demonstrations by the Jordanian people and the adoption of "all necessary measures" to deal with "mass violence." Dulles blatantly interfered in Jordan's internal affairs, thus nakedly exposing the ferocious face of the colonialists to the world.

Everyone knows that it is the United States that is forcing Jordan to join the aggressive Baghdad Pact, that it is the United States that wants to drag Jordan onto a dangerous and disastrous path, and that it is the United States that is plundering and enslaving the Jordanian people under the guise of "aid." So, Dulles, how should these colonialist acts of aggression by the United States in Jordan be "explained"? Why does Dulles pretend to be confused? He must know that the Jordanian people have seen through who is threatening the fate of their country and nation, and therefore they have expressed great anger at the United States and Western colonial countries. The Jordanian people held demonstrations in front of the US Consulate in the Jordanian sector of Jerusalem and set fire to the US "Technical Assistance" agency building in Amman, which was a resistance and warning to the imperialist aggressors, especially to those disguised colonialists. These heroic struggles show that the Jordanian people want to control their own destiny and can no longer tolerate the arbitrary manipulation of them by imperialist forces.

In recent months, the Jordanian people's patriotic struggle against the Baghdad Pact has caused great setbacks to the imperialist forces. The Jordanian people have prevented their country from being dragged into the danger of an aggressive bloc, thereby disrupting the Western countries' timetable for expanding the Baghdad Pact in the Middle East. Not long ago, "senior officials" in Washington admitted that the US plan to "drag Jordan into the Middle East defense alliance" had "encountered difficulties." However, the United States and Western countries are not reconciled, and they have been trying to continue to interfere in Jordan's political situation in order to achieve their goals. At the same time, the US and British propaganda machines have constantly slandered the Jordanian people as "mobs," desperately distorting the Jordanian people's patriotic spirit, and demanding that the Jordanian authorities suppress the people's movement. Now, as the Jordanian people's struggle intensifies, Dulles has personally come forward to carry out this shameful act of interference.

Dulles' so-called "protest" to Jordan is a new offensive by the United States against the Jordanian people. The Jordanian people will continue to fight to break foreign interference. Their personal experience has proven that as long as the people of the whole country unite and wage an indomitable struggle, any imperialist interference and aggression can be repelled and defeated. Today, the people's patriotic movement has played a huge role in Jordan's political situation. On January 9th, the new Jordanian government was formed. The new Prime Minister Samir al-Rifai said in a statement that day, "Joining any new treaty is not the policy of my government." Obviously, the Jordanian people's struggle against the Baghdad Pact will surely achieve greater victories.

    反对杜勒斯干涉约旦内政
    崔奇
    1月8日，正当约旦人民反对巴格达条约的爱国主义斗争继续高涨的时候，美国国务卿杜勒斯竟突然召见约旦驻美国临时代办图康，向约旦提出了“强烈抗议”。他公然要求对约旦人民的反美示威“进行解释”，并采取“一切必要手段”来对付“群众的暴力”。杜勒斯露骨地干涉约旦的内政，从而在全世界面前赤裸裸地暴露了殖民主义者的凶恶面目。
    谁都知道，是美国在强迫约旦加入侵略性的巴格达条约，是美国想把约旦拖上危险和灾难的道路，是美国打着“援助”的幌子掠夺和奴役约旦人民。那末，试问杜勒斯，美国在约旦的这些殖民侵略活动，究竟应该怎样“进行解释”呢？杜勒斯为什么要假装糊涂呢？他必须知道，约旦人民已经看透了是谁在威胁他们的国家和民族的命运，因此他们对美国和西方殖民国家表示了巨大的愤怒。约旦人民在耶路撒冷约旦区的美国领事馆门前举行示威，并放火烧了在安曼的美国“技术援助”机构的大厦，这就是对于帝国主义侵略者，特别是对于那些伪装的殖民主义者的反抗和警告。这些英勇的斗争表明，约旦人民要自己掌握自己的命运，再不能容忍帝国主义势力任意摆布他们了。
    近几个月来，约旦人民反对巴格达条约的爱国主义斗争，使帝国主义势力遭到很大挫折。约旦人民制止了自己的祖国被拖进侵略集团的危险，并从而打乱了西方国家在中近东扩大巴格达条约的时间表。不久以前，华盛顿“高级官方人士”就承认过，“美国把约旦拖入中东防御联盟”的计划，“已经发生困难”。但是，美国和西方国家并不甘心，他们一直企图继续干涉约旦的政治局势，来达到他们的目的。同时，美英宣传机关又不断诬蔑约旦人民是“暴民”，拚命歪曲约旦人民的爱国主义精神，并要求约旦当局对人民运动进行压制。现在，由于约旦人民的斗争日益高涨，杜勒斯竟亲自出面来执行这种可耻的干涉勾当了。
    杜勒斯对约旦的所谓“抗议”是美国对约旦人民的新进攻。约旦人民将为打破外国干涉而继续奋斗。他们的亲身经验已经证明，只要全国人民团结一致，进行不屈不挠的斗争，任何帝国主义的干涉和侵略活动都是可以打退和打败的。今天，人民的爱国主义运动，已经在约旦的政治局势中发生了巨大的作用。1月9日，约旦新政府组成。新任首相萨米尔·里法伊当天发表声明说，“参加任何新的条约都不是我的政府的政策。”很显然，约旦人民反对巴格达条约的斗争一定会获得更大的胜利。
