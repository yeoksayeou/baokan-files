　　Accelerate Design Progress and Provide Drawings Early
　　The scale of our country's basic construction is getting larger and larger. In 1956, the state's total investment in basic construction will increase by more than 50% compared to 1955; the number of important projects starting construction and continuing construction has increased compared to 1955. Of the 156 projects that the Soviet Union is helping us build, 123 will be under construction this year, and more than 2,000 kilometers of new railways will be built. This grand basic construction plan accounts for 32% of the total basic construction workload of the First Five-Year Plan. If we successfully complete this task, it will be possible to complete the basic construction tasks of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
　　The key to completing the huge basic construction plan for 1956 lies in the design departments quickly producing the drawings. In the past few years, our country's industrial design capabilities have grown from scratch, from small to large, and have learned many skills, basically completing the design tasks. However, compared with the ever-increasing needs of national construction, design work often lags behind construction. In 1955, the phenomenon of idle work on basic construction sites across the country was very serious, a large part of which was caused by the inability to supply drawings in a timely manner. Some projects had to be postponed or delayed due to the failure to obtain drawings on time. This year, the supply of drawings has made great progress compared to previous years. For example, 52% of the drawings designed domestically by the Ministry of Heavy Industry have been completely or partially submitted by the end of last year, and basically all construction drawings for this year's construction projects can be submitted before the second quarter of this year. However, fundamentally, the design still lags behind the construction. This cannot but be caught up urgently.
　　Due to the development of our socialist construction situation, the scale of basic construction in 1957 will not only not be smaller than this year, but on the contrary, it will definitely increase. Therefore, on the one hand, the design department must make the greatest efforts to supply the drawings needed for this year's construction in a timely manner, and on the other hand, it must take basic measures from now on to prepare drawings for the engineering projects of 1957 and the Second Five-Year Plan, and strive to fundamentally reverse the passive situation of design lagging behind construction within two or three years. Of course, our current design strength is not sufficient, many important projects cannot be designed independently, and geological data and other design data cannot meet the needs of design. However, it is still possible to speed up the design.
　　Massively adopting standard designs and reusing drawings is the most effective and fundamental measure to speed up the design. In the first half of last year, the use of standard drawings and reused drawings in the coal mine design system only accounted for 5% of the workload of construction drawings. According to the statistics of only five design institutes, more than 5,000 workdays were saved. These workdays can be used to complete the preliminary design of six pairs of mines with an annual output of 600,000 tons of coal. At the end of last year, they held a national drawing exchange conference of coal mine design institutions, and found that among the more than 6,000 individual projects that started this year, more than 4,000 could adopt standard drawings and reuse drawings, and doing so would save more than 100,000 workdays, which is equivalent to the annual workload of more than 500 designers. These workdays can be used to complete the preliminary design of more than 100 pairs of mines with an annual output of 600,000 tons of coal. They estimate that this year, the use of standard drawings and reused drawings can reach 40% of the total workload of construction drawings throughout the year. This possibility of widely adopting standard designs and reusing drawings exists in every design unit.
　　In some designs, appropriately simplifying the design process and designing in advance when basic design data is available is also an important measure to speed up the design. Designing according to certain procedures and relying on sufficient and reliable data is a principle that design work must follow. Any hasty approach will cause errors and bring great losses, and ultimately "more haste, less speed." This is what we firmly oppose. However, for some projects that are technically more confident, the design process can also be appropriately simplified, and even the three-stage design can be combined into a two-stage design. For some simpler engineering projects or the restoration projects of small factories and mines, it is not necessary to adopt a three-stage design, but a field design method should be adopted. After formulating appropriate plans, construction drawings can be issued. This can greatly shorten the design time. For some projects, when basic data is available, design can be started, and then modified according to complete data. The amount of modification work is not very large, and this can also save time. The coal mine system has adopted this approach, which can make the mine design start two or three months earlier.
　　Establishing professional design institutions is a basic measure to cultivate and strengthen design forces, improve technical level and design efficiency. This is an inevitable trend to adapt to the rapid development of industrial technology and the increasing refinement of the division of labor. The Ministry of Heavy Industry is preparing to immediately start forming more than a dozen professional design institutes and design branches within two years to ensure the acceleration of basic construction speed in ferrous metallurgy, non-ferrous metals, chemical industry, building materials industry, and so on. Other ministries are also considering taking such measures. This approach is completely necessary and timely. In order to improve the technical level of design in a planned way, it is also necessary to conduct comprehensive planning for design work to ensure that within a certain period of time, it can independently carry out complete sets of designs for important projects to meet the country's construction requirements. Now, the Ministry of Heavy Industry has put forward a plan: requiring each design institute to learn the complete set of designs for important projects such as an iron and steel joint enterprise with an annual output of 1.5 million tons, and a cement plant with an annual output of 400,000 to 500,000 tons within two years, and other ministries are also conducting such planning. Each design unit should seize the time, mobilize all designers, and formulate detailed and specific plans to ensure the realization of organizational reforms in design work and to achieve the goals of technological development.
　　In order to speed up the design, each design unit must also strengthen the planning and organization of the design, and give full play to the role of designers. It is necessary to strengthen plan management, formulate advanced design plans, scientifically organize all links of design work, strengthen weak links, and eliminate phenomena such as idle work and non-connection in design. It is necessary to rationally use design forces, strengthen the political and ideological education of designers, and further give play to their enthusiasm and creativity. It is necessary to carefully summarize and promote various advanced experiences in design work. Shorten the design time of each process. If we do better in these aspects, we can complete more design tasks faster with the existing human resources.
　　Taking these measures will definitely greatly speed up the design. However, at the same time, it is necessary to strictly ensure the quality of the design and the economic rationality. To make our basic construction undertakings develop forward more, faster, better, and more economically, accelerating design progress and providing drawings early is the glorious task of all design workers at present.

### 加快设计进度，提早供给图纸

　　加快设计进度，提早供给图纸
    我们国家的基本建设规模越来越大了。1956年国家对基本建设的投资总额，将比1955年增加50％以上；开始施工和继续施工的重要工程比1955年增加了。苏联帮助我们建设的156个项目中，有123个要在今年施工，新修建的铁路有二千多公里。这个规模宏伟的基本建设计划，占第一个五年计划基本建设工作量的32％。顺利地完成这个任务以后，第一个五年计划的基本建设任务就有可能提前完成。
    完成1956年的巨大的基本建设计划的关键在于设计部门要迅速地把图纸拿出来。几年来，我国的工业设计力量，从无到有，从小到大，学会了很多本领，基本上完成了设计任务。但是，和国家建设日益增长的需要相比，设计工作还是常常落在施工的后面。1955年，全国各基本建设工地窝工现象很严重，其中很大一部分就是因为图纸不能及时供应所引起的。有些工程因为不能按时得到图纸，不得不被迫推迟开工或延缓竣工日期。今年图纸的供应情况比往年有很大的进步。如重工业部国内设计的图纸，已有52％在去年年底全部交出和部分交出了，今年第二季度以前，基本上可以交完本年施工工程的全部施工图。但是，从根本上说，设计仍然落后于施工。这就不能不急起直追了。
    由于我国社会主义建设形势的发展，1957年的基本建设规模不但不会比今年小，相反的，一定还会增大。因此，设计部门一方面要以最大的努力及时供应今年施工所需要的图纸，另一方面，还必须从现在起，就采取基本措施，为1957年和第二个五年计划的工程项目准备图纸，力争在两三年内根本扭转设计落后于施工的被动局面。当然，目前我们的设计力量还不够充足，许多重要的工程还不能独立进行设计，地质资料和其他设计资料还不能满足设计的需要。但是，加快设计速度仍然是可能的。
    大量地采用标准设计和重复使用图纸，是加快设计速度的最有效最根本的措施。去年上半年，煤矿设计系统采用标准图纸和重复使用图纸仅占施工图工作量的5％，仅据五个设计院的统计，就节省了五千多个工日。用这些工日可以完成六对半年产60万吨煤的矿井的初步设计。去年年底，他们召开了全国煤矿设计机构的图纸交流大会，发现今年开工的六千多个单项工程中，就有四千多个可以采用标准图纸和重复使用图纸，而这样做，就可以节省十万多个工日，等于五百多个设计人员一年的工作量，用这些工日可以完成一百多对年产60万吨煤的矿井的初步设计。他们预计在今年，采用标准图纸和重复使用的图纸，可以达全年施工图工作量的40％。这种广泛采用标准设计和重复使用图纸的可能性，在各个设计单位都有。
    在某些设计中，适当地简化设计程序和在设计资料基本具备的条件下提前设计，也是加快设计速度的一项重要措施。按照一定的程序和依靠充分确实的资料进行设计，是设计工作必须遵守的原则，任何草率从事的做法，都会造成错误，带来很大的损失，最后还是“欲速则不达”。这是我们坚决反对的。但是，有一些工程，技术上比较有把握，也可以把设计程序适当地简化一些，甚至可以把三段设计并成两段设计。有些比较简单的工程项目或小厂矿的恢复工程，更可以不必采用三段设计，而应该采取现场设计的办法，制定适当的规划以后，就可以发出施工图。这样就可以大大缩短设计时间。有一些工程，当基本资料具备的时候，就可以动手设计，然后再根据完整的资料修正，修改的工作量并不很大，而这样也可以争取时间。煤矿系统采取这种做法，可以使矿井设计提前两三个月开工。
    成立专业设计机构，是培养和壮大设计力量、提高技术水平和设计效率的基本措施。这是适应工业技术飞速发展，分工日益精细的必然趋势。重工业部准备立即着手在两年内组成十几个专业的设计院和设计分院，以保证加速黑色冶金、有色金属、化学工业、建筑材料工业等等的基本建设速度。其他各部也正在考虑采取这样的措施。这种做法是完全必要的，适时的。为了有计划地提高设计的技术水平，还必须对设计工作进行全面的规划，保证在一定时期内，能够独立地进行重要工程的成套设计，以满足国家的建设要求。现在，重工业部已经提出计划：要求各设计院在两年内学会年产150万吨的钢铁联合企业、年产40万吨到50万吨的水泥厂等等重要工程的全套设计，其他各部也正在进行这样的规划。各个设计单位应该抓紧时间，动员全体设计人员，制定周密的具体的计划，保证实现设计工作的组织上的改革，和达到技术发展的目标。
    为了加快设计速度，各个设计单位还要加强设计的计划工作和组织工作，充分发挥设计人员的作用。要加强计划管理，制定先进的设计计划，把设计工作的各个环节科学地组织起来，加强薄弱环节，消除设计中的窝工和互不衔接等现象。要合理地使用设计力量，加强对设计人员的政治思想教育，进一步发挥他们的积极性和创造性。要认真地总结和推广设计工作中的各种先进经验。缩短每一个工序的设计时间。如果我们在这些方面做得更好些，就可以在现有的人力条件下，更快地完成更多的设计任务。
    采取这些措施，一定可以大大加快设计速度。但是，同时又必须严格保证设计的质量和经济上的合理。使我们的基本建设事业又多、又快、又好、又省地向前发展，加快设计进度，提早供给图纸，这是全体设计工作人员当前的光荣任务。
