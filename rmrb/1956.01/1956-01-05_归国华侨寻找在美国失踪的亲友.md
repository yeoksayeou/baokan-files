Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th -- Since the Sino-American talks in Geneva reached an agreement on the issue of the return of nationals of both sides, Guangzhou newspapers have received letters from various parties requesting assistance in finding relatives and friends in the United States. Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed several letter writers in the city, who made the following requests:

　　Tan Rongshao, a staff member of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said that his father, Tan Yumin, lived in New York, USA. In March 1955, he suddenly received a letter from relatives and friends in New York stating that his father had gone missing. He had tried every means to inquire about Tan Yumin's whereabouts from relatives and friends in New York, but to no avail. Tan Rongshao said: "In my opinion, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and Kuomintang special agents in New York do not like my father. The garment union he led had launched various struggles, one of which was against the Kuomintang bandits' conspiracy to monopolize the laundry industry. I believe that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Immigration Bureau must know my father's whereabouts, as they have very strict control over overseas Chinese."

　　Chen Ke, an overseas Chinese who used to work in a laundry in New York, requested the US government to account for the whereabouts of his relative, Deng Xianrong. He said that Deng Xianrong ran a laundry in Jersey City, across from New York City. On July 27, 1953, Deng Xianrong sat in a car in front of the door and was driven away. This 50-year-old overseas Chinese, who had lived in the United States for 20 years, has never been seen again.

　　Mei Guangming, an overseas Chinese who used to work as a sailor in Boston, USA, requested the US Immigration Bureau to explain where they had taken the Chinese seaman Yuan Ruixiang. He said that Yuan Ruixiang was only 28 years old and had worked for an American shipping company. In July 1954, the US Immigration Bureau suddenly summoned him and detained him for a month. Mei Guangming said: Since then, Yuan Ruixiang has disappeared without a trace.

　　归国华侨寻找在美国失踪的亲友
    新华社广州4日电　自从日内瓦中美会谈关于双方侨民回国的问题达成协议以来，广州报纸接到各方面来信，要求协助他们寻找在美国的亲友。新华社记者访问了本市几位写信的人，他们提出了下列的要求：
    广东省工会联合会工作人员谭荣绍说，他的父亲谭育民旅居美国纽约。1955年3月他突然接到纽约亲友来信说他父亲失踪了。他曾百般向纽约的亲友打听谭育民的下落，但是终无结果。谭荣绍说：“照我看来，美国联邦调查局和在纽约的国民党特务分子是不喜欢我的父亲的。他领导的衣联会曾经发动过各种斗争，其中之一是反对国民党匪徒垄断洗衣业的阴谋。我相信美国联邦调查局和移民局一定知道我父亲的下落，它们对华侨都管制得很严。”
    曾经在纽约作洗衣馆工作的归国华侨陈科，要求美国政府交代他的亲戚邓显荣的下落。他说，邓显荣在纽约市对岸的泽西城开了一所洗衣馆。1953年7月27日，邓显荣在门口坐上了一辆汽车被开走了。这位旅美20年的50岁华侨就这样一去不复还了。
    过去在美国波士顿作海员的归国华侨梅光明，要求美国移民局说明，他们把中国海员袁瑞祥弄到那里去了？他说，袁瑞祥才28岁，曾经在美国一个轮船公司工作。1954年7月间，美国移民局突然传讯他，并且把他关押了一个月。梅光明说：从此以后袁瑞祥便无影无踪了。
