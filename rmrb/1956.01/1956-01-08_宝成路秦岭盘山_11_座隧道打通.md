The pilot tunnels of the 11 major tunnels in the Qinling Mountain section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway have all been completed and are undergoing further lining.

In order to ensure that the Baoji-Chengdu Railway can be opened to traffic ahead of schedule this year, the workers constructing the Qinling Mountain tunnels have continuously overcome difficulties such as collapses, water seepage, and complex rock conditions. Since the third quarter of last year, the progress of excavating the pilot tunnels of these 11 major Qinling Mountain tunnels has generally exceeded the planned quotas. (Xinhua News Agency)

    宝成路秦岭盘山11座隧道打通
    宝成铁路北段秦岭盘山11座大隧道的导洞已经全部打通，正在进一步衬砌。
    为了使宝成铁路今年能提前通车，修筑秦岭盘山大隧道的工人们不断克服了塌方、出水和石质复杂等的困难。自去年第三季度以来，这11座秦岭盘山大隧道的开挖导洞的进度普遍超过了计划定额。　（新华社）
