Factories and institutes affiliated with the Ministry of Light Industry plan to trial-produce more than 200 new products this year. Among them, the 39 products planned for trial production by the paper industry sector have very high quality requirements. For example, the map paper to be trial-produced must be able to withstand more than 25 folds, have low expansion and contraction, be wear-resistant, and have a clean surface to ensure that the printed maps are accurate and do not deform. This year, it is also planned to use raw materials such as wood and bagasse to manufacture pulp for rayon and artificial wool, to meet the needs of China's rayon fiber factories, which are currently under construction.

This year, the rubber industry sector plans to trial-produce various specifications and patterns of heavy-duty truck tires, tractor tires, and motorcycle tires. The rubber industry also plans to trial-produce more than 70 rubber products needed by medical and other industrial sectors this year.

Among the 63 new products that the pharmaceutical industry sector plans to trial-produce this year, there are drugs used to treat diseases such as malaria, schistosomiasis, filariasis, hookworm disease, and leprosy; there are compound streptomycin injections and chlortetracycline eye ointments, as well as 666 smoke bombs suitable for large-scale elimination of mosquitoes in forest areas. In addition, in terms of medical equipment, a mobile X-ray machine will also be trial-produced. This equipment is suitable for use in small hospitals, clinics, health stations, and rural hospitals.

The sugar, wine, food, and oil industries also plan to trial-produce many new products this year. Among them, after the method of using alcohol to produce white wine is promoted, every 100 jin of sorghum can produce an additional 18 jin of 65-proof white wine.

Of the more than 200 new products that the factories affiliated with the Ministry of Light Industry plan to trial-produce, some are required to be successfully trial-produced this year and start mass production.
