Eradicating the Ten Major Pests and Diseases of Crops in Our Country
Wu Hongji, Deputy Director of the Plant Protection Division, Plant Protection Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture

Rice Stem Borers

Rice stem borers are the most important rice pests in our country, with the striped rice borer and the rice stem borer being the most serious. These pests mainly bore into the stems of rice plants, causing dead heart and whitehead. Middle and late rice in areas where early, middle, and late rice are mixed, and late rice in double-cropping rice areas, are the most severely affected. Generally, yields are reduced by about 10%, but in severe cases, it can reach 70% to 80%, or even result in no harvest. According to estimates from southern Jiangsu and Zhejiang alone in 1949, rice production was reduced by approximately 3 billion jin due to rice stem borers. Although vigorous prevention and control measures have been taken in recent years, the damage caused by this pest is still serious in some areas. According to incomplete statistics from parts of 4 provinces in 1954, rice losses due to stem borers amounted to more than 920 million jin. Therefore, rice stem borers are a serious problem that must be solved to increase rice production in our country.

An effective method of controlling rice stem borers is to concentrate efforts on eliminating overwintering stem borers in rice roots, rice straw, weeds, and zizania latifolia remnants, taking advantage of the habit of striped rice borers overwintering in rice roots and rice stem borers overwintering in rice roots, rice straw, weeds, and zizania latifolia remnants. It is also possible to use 666 pesticide to control and eliminate stem borers in seedling fields and rice fields by catching moths and collecting eggs. By diligently implementing these methods year after year, the damage caused by rice stem borers can be basically eliminated.

Migratory Locusts

Migratory locusts are a historical crop pest in our country. There are records of locust plagues as early as 707 BC. In the 2,600 years since then, until the end of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, there were more than 800 locust plagues. The place of origin of migratory locusts is the wasteland areas along lakes and coasts, where reeds and other weeds are the main food source. After the locust nymphs grow up, they spread to nearby farmland and harm corn, sorghum, millet, wheat, and other crops. After they grow wings, they migrate in groups, causing serious disasters. For example, the Shandong locust plague in 1927 displaced 7 million victims and forced them to flee famine everywhere. In the North China locust plague in 1943, the affected area in Henan Province alone was more than 57 million mu. In the Huanghua area of Hebei Province, not only reeds and crops were eaten by locusts, but even the paper pasted on the windows of farmers' homes was eaten.

Since liberation, the state has vigorously carried out prevention and control, successively implemented a locust situation investigation system, established locust control organizations, adopted locust control methods based on pesticide control, and used aircraft to spray 666 powder, basically controlling migratory locusts and preventing them from becoming a disaster. By further implementing and improving these measures, combined with water conservancy construction and land reclamation, we will certainly be able to eliminate migratory locusts in a relatively short period of time.

Cotton Bollworm

Long ago, American imperialism brought cotton seeds containing bollworms to our country. At present, except for Xinjiang and western Gansu, bollworms have spread to all cotton-growing areas in the country. This pest is an international dangerous pest. It damages cotton buds and flowers in the early stages. The petals of the affected flowers cannot open due to the insect silk sticking them together. In the later stage, it harms green bolls, causing boll shedding and boll rot, seriously affecting cotton yield and quality. In years when this pest is severe, cotton production in the northern cotton-growing areas of our country is reduced by more than 10%, and in the southern cotton-growing areas, it is reduced by more than 20%.

The overwintering period of cotton bollworms is relatively concentrated, which is most conducive to prevention and control. We can eliminate overwintering bollworms hiding in seed cotton, cotton seeds, dry bolls, and cotton warehouses by sunning flowers and cleaning, cleaning cotton warehouses, spraying pesticides, and fumigating cotton seeds. In the field, DDT pesticides can be sprayed in combination with manual control. In addition, plant quarantine work should be strengthened to strictly prohibit the introduction of bollworms into areas without bollworms. By doing so, it is entirely possible to eliminate cotton bollworms.

Cotton Aphids

Cotton aphids suck the nutrients of cotton plants, causing cotton leaves to curl. Severely affected plants die, while lightly affected plants grow slowly, cotton harvest is reduced, and a large number of late season blooms occur. Cotton aphids occur in all cotton-growing areas of the country, and are most serious in the northern cotton-growing areas, greatly hindering cotton production.

This pest can reproduce for two or thirty generations a year, and the fastest can reproduce a generation in 5 days. After the autumn harvest, cotton aphids move from cotton fields to weeds such as sow thistle and prunella vulgaris on the edges of fields, roadsides, grave mounds, and ditches to harm them and lay eggs for overwintering. After the aphid eggs hatch in the coming spring, they first reproduce and harm these weeds, and then move to cotton fields after the cotton seedlings emerge.

Aphid infestations can also be eliminated. The first way to eliminate cotton aphids is to combine fertilizer accumulation with the removal of weeds in late autumn and early spring. During the cotton growing season, combine thinning with the removal of infested cotton seedlings, and use pesticides such as 666, 1605, rotenone, and various effective local medicines and methods to carry out prevention and control in a timely, widespread, continuous, and thorough manner.

Cotton Spider Mites

Cotton spider mites are also a major pest of cotton. Like cotton aphids, they suck the nutrients of cotton plants on the back of cotton leaves. Because they are smaller than cotton aphids, they are not easy to detect without careful inspection. The affected cotton leaves initially show only yellowish-white spots. If prevention and control measures are not taken at this time, the cotton leaves will quickly turn red and fall off. Sometimes, all the cotton leaves on the entire plant fall off, leaving bare stalks.

Cotton spider mites overwinter mostly on fallen leaves and dry weeds, or in soil crevices around mulberry trees and other plants. Therefore, in late autumn and early spring, weeds inside and outside the cotton fields should be thoroughly cleared, and withered branches and fallen leaves should be swept up and burned, and autumn plowing of cotton fields should be carried out to eliminate overwintering spider mites. After the cotton seedlings emerge, inspections should be strengthened. Especially in cotton fields that have been infested in the previous year, once spider mites are found, they should be quickly controlled with lime-sulfur mixture, 1605 and other pesticides. Beans and sesame are vectors of spider mites, so these crops should not be interplanted in cotton fields.

Armyworms

Armyworms are dangerous pests of crops, mainly harming grain crops such as millet, barley, wheat, sorghum, corn, and rice. Sometimes they also harm crops such as sugarcane, cotton, and hemp. An armyworm moth can generally lay 500 to 600 eggs, and at most more than 1,800 eggs. The reproductive capacity is very large, and they will occur in large numbers when the climate is suitable, often eating large areas of crops into bare stalks. After eating a field, they move to another field to harm. According to incomplete statistics, in 1953, armyworm infestations occurred in 690 counties in 25 provinces across the country. In Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong, wheat alone was estimated to have suffered a yield reduction of 23 million jin, and the losses in Northeast China were even greater.

Armyworms are mainly active at night. Moths like sour, sweet, and alcoholic tastes, and flowering plants, especially acacia and scallion flowers, often attract many moths. The eggs are laid on the tips of leaves of crops such as millet, wheat, and corn. The method of eliminating armyworms is to take advantage of the habits of armyworms and start catching moths and collecting eggs early to prevent crops from being harmed. After the larvae occur, the masses should be immediately mobilized to capture and beat them, or to control them with pesticides such as DDT.

Corn Borers

In addition to harming corn, corn borers also seriously harm sorghum and crops such as millet, sugarcane, cotton, and hemp. Some places are severely affected. This pest is widely distributed and occurs in both north and south. In severe years, there are thirty or forty worms in a stalk, and individual places can reduce corn production by 80% to 90%. Eliminating corn borers is of great significance for increasing the production of coarse grains. In 1954, Hebei Province used 666 pesticide solution to irrigate the heart leaves of corn in only 1.1 million mu, with an average yield increase of 15% per mu. Shandong Province controlled more than 4 million mu, with an average yield increase of 30%. If multiple methods are adopted for comprehensive prevention and control, even greater results will be achieved.

Corn borers mainly overwinter in the stalks of corn and sorghum, and in corn cobs. In the coming spring, they pupate and turn into moths, and after laying eggs, they hatch into larvae to harm the crops. They can bore off the tassels of corn, affecting corn pollination, and they can also bore into the stems, depriving the corn of nutrients, and even causing the corn stalks to break, resulting in no harvest. This worm also directly bites the corn kernels.

The main method of eliminating corn borers is to use 666 pesticide solution to irrigate the heart leaves (funnel mouth) during the heart leaf stage of corn growth, eliminating the worms that are concentrated in the heart leaves. Then, use silage, burning, composting, and other methods to completely eliminate overwintering corn borers hiding in corn stalks, sorghum stalks, and corn cobs.

Sweet Potato Black Rot

Sweet potato black rot is a devastating disease that harms sweet potatoes. In 1937, this disease was brought to the Liaodong area of Northeast China from Japan along with the Victory No. 100 sweet potato. Due to the failure to establish domestic plant quarantine work, it has spread to 11 provinces over the past ten years, causing serious losses such as sweet potato bed rot, seedling death, and cellar rot. In Henan, Anhui, and other regions, feeding diseased sweet potatoes to cattle has resulted in many cases of poisoning and death of draught cattle.

The occurrence of sweet potato black rot is mainly due to diseased seed potatoes carrying pathogens, which infect seedlings in the seedbed. Planting diseased seedlings in the field often leads to death. Pathogens brought to the seedbed and the field can generally survive in the soil for 3 years. Diseased sweet potatoes stored in cellars or dumped in manure can also spread the disease.

The key to preventing and controlling sweet potato black rot is to propagate disease-free seed potatoes and cultivate disease-free seedlings, and to strengthen quarantine measures, block affected areas, and strictly prohibit the transportation of diseased sweet potatoes and seedlings. Since black rot bacteria do not harm the green parts of sweet potatoes, sweet potato vines can be cut off during the wheat harvest and propagated in fields that have not been planted with sweet potatoes using clean manure, and harvested and stored separately as seed potatoes. When raising seedlings, replace the seedbed site or seedbed soil, and disinfect the seed potatoes by soaking them in warm water to cultivate disease-free seedlings. In summer sweet potato growing areas, warm bed seedling cultivation and secondary high vine cutting can be used to obtain disease-free seedlings. Combining disease-affected land with crop rotation and not using diseased sweet potatoes to compost manure can eliminate sweet potato black rot.

Currently, special attention needs to be paid to the fact that sweet potatoes are high-yielding crops, and many are being transferred and promoted. Areas that currently do not have black rot should take quarantine measures to strictly prohibit the invasion of diseased seed potatoes. Sweet Potato Black Rot Diseased Sweet Potatoes and Seedlings

Cereal Smut

There are many types of smut that harm cereals. Wheat bunt, wheat loose smut, barley covered smut, barley loose smut, oat covered smut, and loose smut can cause wheat grains to not grow white flour, but instead grow inedible black powder. Wheat stem smut causes the leaves, leaf sheaths, and wheat straw to turn into black powder, and even the ears cannot emerge. These smuts seriously threaten cereal production, generally reducing wheat production by about 10%, and in individual severe cases, by more than 80%.

The spread of smut mainly relies on seeds carrying pathogens. The diseased ears of barley and wheat loose smut emerge early, and the black powder is blown away by the wind and falls on the flowers of healthy wheat, drilling into the wheat seeds. Diseased ears and plants of wheat bunt, stem smut, barley covered smut, oat covered smut, etc., are threshed and hulled together with healthy wheat, and the black powder sticks to the healthy wheat grains. Using this type of wheat seed with pathogens will cause wheat to develop smut. In some areas, diseased wheat bran, wheat straw, or wheat washing water are used for composting, and this unclean manure can also spread the disease. In some areas, diseased wheat stem smut plants are thrown on the ground, and the pathogens in the soil accumulate more and more, which can also spread the disease.

The method of preventing and controlling cereal smut is mainly to establish seed plots to select and retain pure seeds, and to adopt seed dressing with chemicals (warm water soaking is required for barley and wheat loose smut) for seed disinfection to kill pathogens on the outside and inside of the seeds. In areas where manure transmission is common, seed disinfection can be combined with the use of clean manure or methods to isolate manure and seeds for prevention and control. In areas where soil transmission of wheat stem smut is severe, seed disinfection can be combined with tillage to preserve soil moisture and create conditions for early emergence of wheat seedlings, and disease-resistant varieties can be selected or crop rotation can be used for prevention and control. According to the types and conditions of smut occurrence in various places, the adoption of comprehensive prevention and control measures can eliminate cereal smut.

Wheat Nematode Disease

Wheat nematode disease exists in the Yangtze River, Huai River, Yellow River, and Heilongjiang River basins. In 1951, the disease caused a yield reduction of more than 9.5 million jin in 8 prefectures of Shandong Province alone.

The occurrence of wheat nematode disease is due to a tiny animal, the nematode, invading the wheat germ, growing and reproducing with the development of wheat, and finally reaching the ear, turning the wheat grains into round, diseased grains. These diseased grains have no white flour, but instead contain 10,000 to 90,000 nematodes that look like fine cotton velvet. Diseased grains mixed in with good seeds and planted in the ground cause the nematodes to come out of the diseased grains and drill into the wheat germ, which again causes nematode disease.

The key to preventing and controlling this disease is to remove nematode-infected grains from good wheat seeds. The best way to remove diseased grains is to use a wheat nematode disease removal machine. In places where there is no removal machine, water selection and salt water selection methods can be used to float the diseased grains away.

    扑灭我国农作物的十大病虫害
    农业部植物保护局植物保护处副处长  吴宏吉
    水稻螟虫
    水稻螟虫是我国最主要的水稻害虫，以三化螟、二化螟最为严重。这些害虫主要蛀食水稻的茎秆，造成枯心苗和白穗。早、中、晚稻混栽地区的中、晚稻和双季稻地区的晚稻受害最重，受害的一般减产10％左右，严重的可达70％至80％，甚至颗粒无收。仅据1949年苏南、浙江两地的估计，就因为受水稻螟虫的害减产稻谷约30亿斤。近几年虽经大力防治，但部分地区这种虫为害仍然严重。1954年据4个省部分专区和县的不完全统计，即因螟害损失稻谷9.2亿多斤。因此，水稻螟虫是我国水稻增产上必须解决的一个严重问题。
    防治水稻螟虫的有效方法是利用三化螟在稻根中过冬，二化螟在稻根、稻草、杂草和茭白遗株内过冬的习性，集中力量消灭这些地方的过冬螟虫；还可以用六六六药剂除治及捕蛾、采卵等办法消灭秧田和稻田里的螟虫。连年认真地实行这些办法，就能基本消灭水稻螟虫的为害。

    下：二化螟幼虫
    飞　蝗
    飞蝗是我国历史性的农作物害虫，早在公元前707年就有蝗虫成灾的记载，此后2，600多年来，一直到国民党反动统治结束，共发生蝗灾800多次。飞蝗的原产地是沿湖滨海的荒洼地区，以芦苇等杂草为主要食料，蝗蝻长大以后就蔓延到附近的农田里为害玉米、高粱、谷子、小麦等庄稼。等长了翅膀以后就成群迁飞，造成严重的灾害。例如1927年山东蝗灾，曾使700万灾民流离失所，四处逃荒；1943年华北大蝗害，河南一省受害面积就有5，700余万亩，河北省黄骅一带不仅芦苇、庄稼都被蝗虫吃尽，甚至连农家的糊窗纸也被吃掉。
    解放以来，国家大力进行防治，先后推行了蝗情侦查制度，建立了治蝗组织，采用了以药剂除治为主的治蝗方法，并且用飞机喷撒六六六粉剂，基本上控制了飞蝗，使它不能成灾。进一步贯彻执行和改进这些措施，结合兴修水利和垦荒，我们一定能够在较短时期内消灭飞蝗。

    下：飞蝗成虫
    棉花红铃虫
    很早以前，美帝国主义就把带有红铃虫的棉籽运来我国。目前，除了新疆和甘肃西部以外，红铃虫已蔓延到全国各棉区。这种害虫是国际性的危险害虫。它在早期为害棉花的蕾和花。被害的花，因虫丝粘缀，花瓣不能开放。后期为害青铃，造成落铃、僵瓣，严重影响棉花的产量和质量。受这种虫害严重的年份，我国北部棉区棉花受害减产10％以上，南部棉区减产20％以上。
    棉花红铃虫的过冬时期比较集中，最有利于防治。我们可以用晒花清扫、棉仓清扫、喷药、薰蒸棉籽等办法消灭躲在籽棉、棉籽、枯铃和棉仓等处的过冬红铃虫。在田间，可以喷滴滴涕药剂，结合人工防治。此外，还要加强植物检疫工作，严禁红铃虫传入无红铃虫的地区。这样做，完全有可能消灭棉花红铃虫。
    上：棉红铃虫幼虫
    下：棉红铃虫成虫
    棉　蚜
    棉蚜吸食棉株的养分，使棉叶卷缩。被害严重的全株枯死，轻的棉株生长迟缓，棉花收获量减少，并造成大量的霜后花。棉蚜发生在全国各棉区，北方棉区最为严重，对棉花增产妨害很大。
    这种害虫一年可以繁殖二、三十代，最快的5天就能繁殖一代。秋收后棉蚜由棉田转移到田边、路边、坟头、沟边的苦买菜、夏枯草等杂草上为害，产卵过冬；来年春天蚜卵孵化后，先在这些杂草上繁殖为害，棉苗出土后就转移到棉田。
    蚜害也是可以消灭的。消灭棉蚜的办法，首先是在秋末春初结合积肥，清除杂草。在棉花生长期间，结合间苗剔除有虫的棉苗，并用六六六、一六○五、鱼藤精等药剂和各种有效的土药土法，及时地普遍地连续地彻底地进行防治。
    上左：棉蚜——有翅幼蚜
    上右：棉蚜——无翅蚜
    下：棉蚜——有翅蚜
    棉红蜘蛛
    棉红蜘蛛也是棉花的主要害虫，和棉蚜一样在棉叶的背面吸食棉株的养分。因为它们身体比棉蚜还要小，不仔细检查就不易发现。被害的棉叶，初期只是呈现出黄白色的小点；这时如不防治，棉叶很快就发红、脱落，有时全株棉叶都落光，成为光秆。
    棉红蜘蛛多在落叶、干杂草上过冬或在桑棵和其他植物周围的土缝中过冬。所以应在秋末春初彻底清除棉田内外杂草、扫集烧毁枯枝落叶，并实行棉田秋耕，以消灭过冬的红蜘蛛。棉苗出土后要加强检查；特别是前一年曾经受过害的棉田，一发现有红蜘蛛，就要迅速用石灰硫磺合剂、一六○五等药剂防治。豆类和芝麻等都是红蜘蛛的媒介，棉田里不可间种这类作物。

   右：棉红蜘蛛成虫
    黏　虫
    黏虫是农作物的危险害虫，主要为害谷子、大麦、小麦、高粱、玉米、水稻等粮食作物，有时也为害甘蔗、棉、麻等作物。一个粘虫蛾子一般可产卵500至600粒，最多能产卵1，800多粒，繁殖力很大，遇到气候适宜就会大量发生，常常把大片农作物吃成光秆，吃完一块田又转移到另一块田去为害。据不完全统计：1953年全国有25省690多县发生黏虫为害，山东莱阳专区仅小麦一项估计就受害减产2，300万斤，东北地区损失更大。
    黏虫主要在晚间活动，蛾子喜欢酸、甜、酒味，开花的植物，特别是洋槐和葱花上，常聚集很多蛾子。卵产在谷子、麦子和玉米等作物的叶尖。消灭黏虫的方法是利用黏虫的习性，及早动手捕蛾、采卵，不使庄稼被害。幼虫发生以后，就要立刻动员群众进行捕打或用滴滴涕等农药防治。
    上：黏虫成虫
    下：黏虫幼虫
    玉米螟
    玉米螟除为害玉米外，还严重地为害高粱和谷子、甘蔗、棉、麻等作物，有些地方受害很重。这种害虫分布很广，南北各地都有发生。严重年份，一株秸秆内有虫三、四十条，个别地方能使玉米减产八、九成。消灭玉米螟对于杂粮增产意义极大。1954年河北省仅用六六六药水灌玉米心叶的办法防治了110万亩，每亩平均增产15％；山东省防治400多万亩，平均增产30％。如果采用多种办法，综合防治，还要收到更大的效果。
    玉米螟主要在玉米、高粱的秸秆和玉米轴里过冬，来年春天化蛹变蛾，产卵以后孵化为幼虫为害，可以蛀断玉米的雄穗，影响玉米受粉，还能在茎秆内蛀食，剥夺玉米的养分，甚至使玉米秆折断，颗粒无收；这种虫还直接咬食玉米粒。
    消灭玉米螟的主要方法是在玉米生长的心叶期用六六六药水灌心叶（喇叭口），把集中在心叶里为害的虫子一鼓歼灭，再用青贮、烧毁、沤肥等办法把藏在玉米秆、高粱秆、玉米轴里的过冬玉米螟消灭干净。

    下：玉米螟幼虫
    甘薯黑斑病
    甘薯黑斑病是为害甘薯的毁灭性病害。1937年从日本随着胜利百号甘薯把这种病害带到了东北辽东地区。由于没有建立对内植物检疫工作，十多年以来，已传播蔓延了11个省，造成甘薯烂床、死苗和烂窖等严重的损失。河南、安徽等地区更因使用病薯喂牛，发生不少耕牛中毒死亡事件。
    甘薯黑斑病的发生，主要由于受病的种薯带有病菌，在苗床上侵害了幼苗，病苗栽到地里多致死亡。病菌带到苗床和地里，一般在土壤中还能生活3年；病薯放在窖里或倒在粪里，也能传染病害。
    防治甘薯黑斑病的关键是繁殖无病种薯和培育无病秧苗，并加强检疫措施，封锁有病地区，严禁病薯、病苗外运。由于黑斑病菌不侵害甘薯的绿色部分，可以在麦收的时候，剪取甘薯蔓子在没有种过甘薯的地里使用净粪繁殖甘薯，单收单藏留作种薯。育苗时更换床址或床土，并对种薯采取温汤浸种的办法进行消毒，就能培育无病的秧苗。栽培夏薯地区，可用温床育苗和二次高剪蔓的办法，得到无病秧苗。结合病地换茬轮栽，不拿病薯沤粪等措施，可以消灭甘薯黑斑病。
    目前更需要特别注意的是：甘薯是高产作物，调运推广很多，现在没有黑斑病的地区要采取检疫措施，严禁带病种薯侵入。甘薯黑斑病病薯及病苗
    麦类黑穗病
    为害麦类的黑穗病种类很多。小麦腥黑穗病、小麦散黑穗病、大麦坚黑穗病、大麦散黑穗病、燕麦坚黑穗病和散黑穗病能使麦粒不长白面，而长了不能吃的黑粉子；小麦秆黑穗病使小麦的叶子、叶鞘和麦秸都变成黑粉，连麦穗都抽不出来。这些黑穗病严重地威胁着麦类生产，一般的使麦子减产一成左右，个别严重的能减产80％以上。
    黑穗病的传染主要靠种子携带病菌。大、小麦散黑穗病的病穗抽穗早，黑粉被风吹散，落到好麦的花上，钻进麦种里面；小麦腥黑穗病、秆黑穗病、大麦坚黑穗病、燕麦坚黑穗病等病穗、病株和好麦一起打场脱粒，黑粉子沾到好麦粒上。使用这种带病菌的麦种，麦子就生黑穗病。有些地区把有病的麦糠、麦草或淘麦水沤粪，这种不干净的粪也能传染病害；有些地区把小麦秆黑穗病的病株扔在地里，土壤中病菌越集越多，也能传染病害。
    防治麦类黑穗病的办法，主要是建立留种地选留净种，并采用药剂拌种（对大、小麦散黑穗病要用温汤浸种）的办法进行种子消毒，杀灭种子外部和内部的病菌。在粪肥传染地区，可以用种子消毒结合采用净肥或者使粪和种子隔离的办法防治。小麦秆黑穗病土壤传染严重的地区，可用种子消毒结合耕作保墒造成麦苗早出土的条件，并选用抗病品种或换茬轮作的办法防治。根据各地黑穗病发生的种类和条件，采用综合防治措施，就可以消灭麦类黑穗病。上左：小麦散黑穗

    病病株
    小麦线虫病
    小麦线虫病在长江、淮河、黄河、黑龙江流域都有。1951年仅山东省8个专区因为这种病为害，就减产950多万斤。
    小麦线虫病的发生是由于一种微小的动物——线虫侵入了麦芽，随小麦发育而生长繁殖，最后达到麦穗，把麦粒变成圆形的病粒。这种病粒里没有白面，而是像细棉绒一样的1万到9万条线虫。病粒混在好种子里一起种到地里，线虫从病粒里出来钻进麦芽里，就又造成线虫病。
    防治这种病害的关键是把线虫病粒从好麦种里清除出去。清除病粒的最好的办法是用线虫病汰除机。没有汰除机的地方，用清水选种、盐水选种的办法，都可以把病粒漂选出去。
