    Anshan Iron and Steel Company plans to trial-produce over sixty new products this year, with more than half scheduled for trial production in the first quarter. The emphasis will be on various large-sized steel sections, including I-beams and channel steel for constructing large factories and bridges, backbone-shaped steel for manufacturing train backbones, and crane rails capable of supporting 100-ton cranes. A wide variety of steel materials for manufacturing train locomotives, carriages, bridges, and shipbuilding will also be trial-produced in large quantities. Over a dozen types are expected to be successfully trial-produced within the first quarter of this year.

    Thin steel plates for manufacturing agricultural tools and steel for manufacturing plowshares, both urgently needed for agricultural production, will be rolled immediately.

    This year, many new varieties will also be trial-produced in the production of steel ropes, cast iron pipes, chemicals, and refractory materials. The metal products factory will also trial-produce cold-drawn reinforcing bars to supply the construction sector with a large quantity of prefabricated concrete components. (Xinhua News Agency)

    鞍钢今年将试制六十多种新产品
    今年鞍山钢铁公司准备试制六十多种新产品，其中半数以上要在第一季度内试制。试制的重点是尺寸很大的各种型钢，其中有建筑巨大厂房和桥梁用的工字钢和槽钢，有制造火车脊椎用的脊型钢，有可以承担一百吨吊车行走的吊车钢轨；制造火车机车、车厢、桥梁和造船用的各种钢材，都将大量试制。在今年第一季度内要试制成功的就有十几种。
    农业生产方面迫切需要的制造农具用的薄钢板和制造犁铧用的钢材，马上就要开始轧制了。
    今年在钢绳、生铁铸管、化工和耐火材料等生产方面，也将试制许多新品种。金属制品厂还要试制冷拉钢筋，以便大量供应建筑部门制造混凝土预制构件。　　（新华社）
