Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd – Marshal Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, held a grand banquet on the 1st to celebrate the New Year.

Marshal Kim Il-sung delivered a speech at the banquet. He first outlined the great achievements made by the Korean people in economic reconstruction in 1955. He said that the 1955 national plan for the total industrial output value of state-owned and cooperative-owned enterprises in the Republic had been overfulfilled by 5%, and some factories and mines had completed the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In 1955, a series of important industrial production facilities were restored and newly built, more than 170 schools and hospitals were restored and newly built, and residential buildings with a construction area of one million square meters were built for workers and staff. The total harvest of agricultural products also increased significantly compared to 1954.

He then said that in the past year, we have continued to fight for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. We have repeatedly put forward propositions regarding this, and the Soviet Union and many other countries have also put forward suggestions regarding this; however, they have all been rejected by the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique. However, we are not disappointed, because regardless of whether the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique are willing or not, all domestic and international situations are developing in a direction favorable to us.

Marshal Kim Il-sung finally pointed out that this year is the last year of the Three-Year Plan for the post-war recovery and development of the people's economy in Korea, and it is of particular importance for the future development of the Republic. He called on all the people to mobilize even more vigorously and strive to complete or overfulfill the Three-Year Plan in the new year.

    金日成的新年演说
    据新华社平壤2日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成元帅在1日举行盛大宴会，祝贺新年。
    金日成元帅在宴会上发表了演说。他首先概述了朝鲜人民在1955年在经济恢复建设中取得的巨大成就。他说，1955年度共和国全国的国营和合作社营的工业总产值计划已经超额5％完成，有一些厂矿已经提前完成了三年计划。在1955年内恢复和新建了一系列的重要的工业生产设备，恢复和新建了170多所学校和医院，为工人和职员建设了建筑面积达一百万平方公尺的住宅。农产品总收获量比1954年也有显著提高。
    他接着说，在过去一年间，我们继续为祖国和平统一进行了斗争。我们一再提出了关于这方面的主张，苏联和其他许多国家也提出了关于这方面的建议；但是，都遭到了美国和李承晚集团的拒绝。不过，我们并不失望，这是因为不管美国和李承晚集团愿意或者不愿意，一切国内和国际的形势正向着有利于我们的方向发展。
    金日成元帅最后指出，今年是朝鲜战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划的最后一年，对共和国今后的发展具有特别重要的意义。他号召全体人民更紧张地动员起来，为在新的一年中完成或者超额完成三年计划而奋斗。
