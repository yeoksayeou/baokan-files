Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: The U.S. Air Force has once again brazenly violated China's northeastern airspace.

    At 10:03 AM on January 9th, two U.S. military aircraft intruded into China's airspace from a point 20 kilometers west of Linjiang on the north bank of the Yalu River, and then intruded northward into the airspace over the Tonghua, Qingyuan, and Shenyang regions of China. Our air force aircraft immediately took off in pursuit, and the two U.S. military aircraft immediately fled.

    Local people expressed great indignation at the United States' brazen dispatch of its military aircraft to invade China's airspace, and pointed out that this is another open provocative act in a series of activities by the United States to continue creating tension in the Far East.

Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued the following statement regarding the U.S. Air Force's intrusion into Chinese airspace on January 9th:

    On January 9, 1956, the intrusion of two U.S. military aircraft into China's northeastern airspace was a serious act of military provocation by the United States, violating China's territorial sovereignty. The Chinese government lodges a strong protest against this and demands that the U.S. government take measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

    The Chinese government deems it necessary to point out that at a time when the U.S. government is adopting a delaying policy in the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Geneva on the one hand, and sending a large number of senior officials to the Taiwan region of China to step up military activities on the other, the incident of U.S. military aircraft intruding into China's northeastern airspace is by no means accidental. This incident further exposes the United States' attempt to continue creating tension in the Far East. This behavior of the U.S. government has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people, and peace-loving countries and people around the world cannot but maintain a high degree of vigilance against the provocative activities of the United States.

    美国空军公然侵犯我国东北领空
    我国政府强硬抗议美国的军事挑衅
    新华社10日讯　美国空军又一次公然侵犯我国东北领空。
    9日上午10时3分，美国军用飞机两架，由鸭绿江北岸的临江以西20公里处侵入我国领空，随后向北侵犯我国通化、清原、沈阳等地区领空。我空军飞机当即起飞追击，该两架美国军用飞机即行逃逸。
    当地人民对美国公然派遣其军用飞机侵犯我国领空的行为，表示极大愤慨，并且指出这是美国在远东继续制造紧张局势的一连串活动的又一次公开挑衅行为。
    新华社10日讯　中华人民共和国外交部发言人就1月9日美国空军侵入中国领空事发表谈话如下：
    1956年1月9日，美国军用飞机两架侵入我国东北领空是美国侵犯中国领土主权的一件严重的军事挑衅行为。对此，中国政府提出强硬抗议，并且要求美国政府采取措施，保证不得再有类此事件发生。
    中国政府认为有必要指出：正当美国政府一方面在日内瓦中美两国大使级会谈中采取拖延政策，另一方面派遣大批高级官员到我国台湾地区加紧军事活动的时候，美国军用飞机侵入我国东北领空的事件绝不是偶然的。这一事件进一步揭露了美国力图在远东继续制造紧张局势。美国政府的这种行为引起了中国人民的极大愤慨，全世界爱好和平的国家和人民不能不对美国的挑衅活动保持高度的警惕。
