Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st: On the eve of the joyful New Year, the Soviet people have achieved another glorious labor victory. On December 29th, the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station began generating electricity. The first batch of electricity generated by the first unit was sent to the Kuibyshev power grid through transmission lines erected 80 meters above the ground.

　　The construction site of the hydroelectric station was filled with a festive atmosphere. The reinforced concrete walls of the power plant building and the towers of the excavators were covered with portraits of party and government leaders, festive slogans, and flags. The installation of the second unit is nearing completion. The construction workers decided to put the third unit into production before the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

　　The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station was decided to be built by the Soviet Council of Ministers in August 1950. For more than five years, the area near Zhiguli in Kuibyshev City has completely changed its appearance. On the soft soil area, tall and magnificent dams, power plants, and navigation locks have appeared. The water level of the Volga River, blocked by the dam, is rising day by day. Now, the water levels inside and outside the dam differ by more than ten meters.

　　After the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station is fully put into production, its power generation capacity will reach 2.1 million kilowatts. Its annual power generation is equivalent to six times the power generation of all power stations in Russia before the revolution, and it is about one-third larger than the power generation capacity of the largest Boulder Hydroelectric Station in the United States, which took the United States forty years to build.

　　The price of electricity generated by the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station is 75% to 80% cheaper than the price of electricity generated by general thermal power plants.

　　After the Kuibyshev artificial sea is completely formed, the sea surface will reach 25,000 square kilometers, and one million hectares of arid grassland in the Volga River Basin will be fully irrigated. On the irrigated land, the yield of grain will increase fivefold, and the yield of crops such as potatoes and vegetables will increase ninefold. The navigation of the Volga River will also be greatly improved.

### 古比雪夫水电站开始发电

　　古比雪夫水电站开始发电
    据新华社莫斯科31日电　欢乐的新年前夕，苏联人民又获得了一个光荣的劳动胜利，12月29日，古比雪夫水电站开始发电了。第一台联动机发出的第一批电力，通过架在80公尺高空中的输电线，送到古比雪夫动力网里去。
    水电站的工地上是一片节日气象。发电厂厂房的钢筋混凝土墙壁上和挖土机的塔楼上，布满着党和政府领袖的画像、节日的标语和旗帜。第二台联动机的装置已经接近完成。建筑工人决定要使第三台联动机在苏联共产党第20次代表大会以前投入生产。
    古比雪夫水电站是苏联部长会议在1950年8月决定建筑的。五年多以来，古比雪夫城日古里附近，已经完全改变了面貌。在松软的土壤地带上，已经出现了高大雄伟的拦河坝、发电厂和通航水闸。被堤坝堵住的伏尔加河水的水面，正一天天在升高，现在堤坝内外水平面，已经相差十公尺以上。
    古比雪夫水电站全部投入生产后，发电能力将达到210万瓩，它每年的发电量，相当于革命前俄国所有电力站发电量的六倍，比美国化了四十年时间才建造成功的美国最大的波尔德水电站的发电能力，还要大三分之一左右。
    古比雪夫水电站所发电力的价格，要比一般火力发电站所发电力的价格便宜75％到80％。
    古比雪夫人工海完全形成后，海面将达25，000平方公里，伏尔加河流域一百万公顷的干旱草原地带将得到充分的灌溉。在受灌溉的土地上，谷物的产量将增加到五倍，马铃薯、蔬菜等作物的产量将增加到九倍。伏尔加河的航运也将得到巨大的改善。
