    People Who Completed 5 Years' Worth of Work Ahead of Schedule
    By January 10th, five workers at the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory had successively completed their individual workloads for the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Now, after detailed calculations, milling machine operators Chen Haigen and Xuan Yuanquan, and lathe operator Zhuang Jinkui, have also proposed guarantees to complete six and a half years' worth of work in four years. Lathe operator Zhuang Minggeng, who completed five years' worth of work in two years and eight months, recently proposed a new guarantee to complete seven years' worth of work in four years. On January 14th, he and Le Junde, a national activist in socialist construction among young people, and 12 other advanced workers, proposed an initiative to lathe operators in railway factories across the country, suggesting the launch of a labor emulation campaign among workers of the same type to guarantee quality and complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Trade Unions wrote a letter to Zhuang Minggeng on January 14th to congratulate him.
    Chang Dunchun, a sand mold worker at the Wuxi Rubber Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Jiangsu Province, has completed the workload for the First Five-Year Plan period.
    Chang Dunchun is a member of the Communist Youth League. He only began working as a sand molder in 1953. Because he actively studied technology, he has successively improved six operating methods and tools, which greatly increased production efficiency. Now, the rubber roller cores he produces each day are ten times more than when he started this work in 1953, and the product quality is also very good.

    提前完成5年工作量的人们
    到1月10日止，戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂已经有5个工人先后提前完成了第一个五年计划期间的个人工作量。现在，铣工陈海根、宣元铨和车工庄金奎经过详细计算，又分别提出了4年内完成6年半工作量的保证。在两年零八个月内就完成了5年工作量的车工庄铭耕，最近又提出了以4年时间完成7年工作量的新保证。1月14日，他和全国青年社会主义建设积极分子乐俊德等12个先进工人，向全国铁路工厂的车工提出倡议，建议开展一个保证质量、提前完成五年计划的同工种劳动竞赛。中共江苏省委员会和江苏省工会联合会在14日曾写信向庄铭耕祝贺。
    江苏省地方国营无锡橡胶厂翻砂工人常敦春，已经完成了第一个五年计划期间的工作量。
    常敦春是青年团员，他在1953年才开始做翻砂工作。由于他积极钻研技术，先后改进了6项操作方法和工具，生产效率提高很快。现在，他每天生产的橡胶滚筒芯子，比1953年开始做这一工作的时候提高了10倍，产品质量也很好。
