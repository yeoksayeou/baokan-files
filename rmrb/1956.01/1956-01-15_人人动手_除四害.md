Everyone Mobilizes to "Eliminate the Four Pests"
You Huang

Since late December 1955, the people of Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, have universally launched a large-scale cleaning campaign centered on eliminating the "Four Pests." The Yatang Street Residents' Committee purchased 50 rat traps at once and mobilized every household to catch rats. The Lanximen residential area caught 59 rats in two days using newly bought rat traps. The Railway Station Residents' Committee formed "Eliminate the 'Four Pests' Assault Teams" from the heads of each residents' group, and also mobilized residents to dredge the dirty ditches along the railway, drain sewage, and dig up fly pupae near public toilets.

After cleaning the classrooms inside and out during their spare time, 600 students from Jinhua No. 1 Junior High School took the lead, grabbing hoes and digging for fly pupae one meter away from the toilets. After compacting the soil where the fly pupae were hiding, they also sprinkled lime. Some students carried hot water to flush the cesspools and kill maggots. The students also cleaned up the garbage in the basement, preventing it from becoming a wintering place for mosquitoes and flies. They also plan to seal the cracks in the stone walls with mud to eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies. Female students from Wujiang Junior High School and Jinhua Girls' Middle School, in groups of three or five, are weaving sparrow nets, preparing to catch sparrows.

Staff members of the grain department, who are often plagued by rats and sparrows, have placed rat traps everywhere in the grain company's warehouses and stores, and have already caught 119 rats. They have also mastered the characteristic of sparrows flying towards the light, closing the windows on three sides of the empty granary, leaving only one side open; adding a fine net outside the open window to drive the sparrows into the net, catching more than 30 at a time.

The Jinhua Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League has notified all grassroots organizations of the Youth League to form "Eliminate the 'Four Pests' Squads." Each squad will send out "scouts" to find places where rats and sparrows are concentrated in order to encircle and annihilate them. The Jinhua Women's Federation is also mobilizing women to actively participate in the "Eliminate the 'Four Pests'" campaign. (Attached picture)

    人人动手“除四害”
    有煌
    浙江省金华全市人民在1955年12月下旬起普遍开展了以扑灭“四害”为中心的大扫除运动。雅堂街居民委员会一次就添购了鼠夹50只，发动家家户户都来捕鼠。兰溪门居民区在两天中用新买来的鼠夹捕获老鼠59只。火车站居民委员会把各居民组长组成“除‘四害’突击队”，并且发动居民把沿铁路的脏沟疏通，排除污水，挖掘公共厕所附近的蝇蛹。
    金华市第一初级中学600个学生在课余时间把教室内外打扫得干干净净以后，又抢先拿着铁锄，到离厕所1公尺的地方去挖蝇蛹。他们把有蝇蛹躲藏着的泥土打实以后，还撒上了石灰。有的学生挑来热水，冲洗粪池，灭杀蛆虫。学生们还扫除了地下室里的垃圾，不让地下室成为蚊蝇过冬的场所。他们还准备用泥封住石墙隙缝，消灭越冬蚊蝇。婺江初级中学和金华女子中学的女学生们，三五成群地编织着捕雀网，准备去捕捉麻雀。
    经常遭受到老鼠、麻雀侵害的粮食部门的工作人员，在粮食公司的仓库和门市部里到处放上鼠夹，已经捕获老鼠119只。他们并且掌握了麻雀迎着亮光飞的特点，把空粮仓里的窗户三面关闭，只留出一面；在开着的窗户外面加上一道细网，把麻雀赶入网内，这样，一次就捉住了30多只。
    青年团金华市委已经通知青年团的各个基层组织组成“除‘四害’中队”。各个中队将派出“侦察员”寻找 鼠、雀集中的地方，以便加以围歼。金华市妇联也正在发动妇女积极参加除“四害”的活动。（附图片）
