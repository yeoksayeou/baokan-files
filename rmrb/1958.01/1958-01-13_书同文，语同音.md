Title: Unified Script, Unified Pronunciation

    Writing characters is difficult: "Picking up the pen feels like lifting a thousand pounds;" speaking is difficult: "Same sound, different characters." These are significant "stumbling blocks" in our learning and communication of culture.

    I studied from a young age, and the private school teacher said: This is the standard form, that is the broken form; if a character's strokes are wrong, even if the essay is well-written, the examiner will not accept it. A good teacher will first correct students' miswritten characters. There are several characters for which I was scolded countless times, but even now, I have to review them before writing them. Such as the *zao* in “凿山开河 (záo shān kāi hé, dig through mountains and open rivers)", the *dou* in “乡邻有鬬者 (xiāng lín yǒu dòu zhě, when neighbors have quarrels)", the *zao* in “宁媚于竈 (nìng mèi yú zào, rather flatter the stove)", the *wu* of 乌*gui* (wū *guī*, tortoise)... etc. These characters are now simplified; to write the complex forms is truly "difficult indeed!"

    I finished the Five Classics at the age of eleven, and "had nothing to read." My father, a man with little education, heard someone say, "The Selections of Refined Literature" is good, "If you are familiar with 'Wen Xuan,' you're halfway to becoming a scholar." He probably wanted his son to pass the imperial examinations, so he asked someone to buy a copy of "Selections of Refined Literature" from the city. The private school teacher also had little education and didn't know which chapters to read with understanding, so he started with "The Two Capitals" and "The Three Metropolises." If I didn't recognize a character, I would look it up in the "Kangxi Dictionary." The teacher was impatient to look it up himself and told the students to do it themselves. I didn't know "Fanqie" (a traditional Chinese pronunciation method), so I could only look at the phonetic characters; if I didn't recognize the phonetic characters, I would look them up again, and there it would give the phonetic of that character. I would spend two or three hours looking up characters every day for the few hundred characters of text I had to read. And I still had to memorize it by rote. In this way, I suffered for several years, but it was of no use at all. Therefore, I have a strong aversion to asking students to memorize ancient literary works that contain stiff and awkward phrases. Just because the older generation went to jail, does that mean the younger generation must also go to jail?

    Although I knew from a very young age that traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions allowed for writing "bai zi" (白字, "white characters," i.e., simplified or wrongly used characters), called "yao bai yan" (药白眼, medicine white eye), and farmers wrote "bai zi" when recording daily accounts, I always thought that writing "zheng ti zi" (正體字, "standard characters") was the proper thing to do. In 1931, when I arrived in the Honghu Soviet Area, the vast majority of the residents there were illiterate, but they were very enthusiastic about learning to read and write. Everyone had a "pad of paper" and a pencil or fountain pen, and they would study whenever they had time. They created many new characters, such as a simplified character for "tuan (团, group)", "dai (代, surname)", and "dou (鬬, fight)", which I saw there for the first time. They also created some new terms: Farmers didn't like long terms, so they called organizational life meetings simply "guo sheng huo (过生活, passing life)," and organizational introduction letters were called "sheng huo tiao zi (生活条子, life slips)"; they also didn't like terms with unclear meanings, so some terms changed in meaning there.

    Only then did I realize that not only should characters be changed, first of all they should be simplified, and also that our vocabulary was very limited. Not only should new things have new terms, but there should also be many creations for use in everyday life among the general people. This completely shattered my blind faith in the old writing system.

    The simplification of Chinese characters is only the first step, but to those who have suffered from the difficulty of writing characters, it seems like we are doing a good deed for our descendants.

    Let's talk about speaking! There is such a habit that people from the same hometown must speak in their local dialect when they meet, otherwise they are "selling out their ancestors." Speech is meant to be heard by others, so why speak in a language that others cannot understand?

    My accent is very heavy. Once I went to a radio station to speak, and after I spoke, the announcer had to translate for me, which was very embarrassing. In ordinary meetings: what I say is not fully understood by others, and what others say is not fully understood by me. Although we are facing each other, it is as if there is a curtain between us. If I were to go among the peasant masses or the working-class masses, it would not just be a curtain but a mountain separating us, and it would be simply impossible to speak.

    To speak, you have to find a translator. Should such a situation be passed on to our descendants? It is a bit difficult for adults to learn Putonghua (Mandarin Chinese), but it is very easy for young people. In a few years, at most fifteen years, it will not only be "unified script" but also "unified pronunciation."

    We have been hoping for unified pronunciation for many years, but like other wishes, it can only be quickly and completely realized when the people control their own destiny and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

    [Editor's Note] To help readers understand and actively support the work of language reform and increase some knowledge about language reform, we are opening a column called "Miscellaneous Talks on Language Reform." This column will use short and lively writing to discuss some issues of concern to everyone in the work of language reform. We hope that everyone will offer more opinions and suggestions for this column.

    书同文，语同音
    谢觉哉
    字难写：“提起笔有千斤重”；话难说：“字同音不同”。这是我们学习文化和交流文化的很大“绊脚石”。
    我从小读书，塾师说：这是正体字，那是破体字，字的笔画有错，即使文章做得好，试官也是不取的。会教书的人，首先是纠正学生的错别字。有几个字我不知道挨过多少骂，但到现在要我写出来还得先温习。如“鑿山开河”的鑿字，“乡邻有鬬者”的鬬字，“宁媚于竈”的竈字，乌?的?字……等。这些字现在是简化了，要写繁的，真是“难矣哉”！
    我十一岁读完了五经，“没有书读了”。父亲是一个读书很少的人，不知听了甚么人说：“昭明文选”好，“文选熟，秀才半”，大概他是想儿子中秀才罢，托人进城买了一册“昭明文选”。塾师也是个读书不多的，不知道选几篇懂的读，而是从“两京”“三都”读起。字不认得，翻“康熙字典”；塾师不耐烦翻，要学生自己翻。我又不知道“反切”，只能看音的字；音的字不认得，又去翻，那里又音了这个字，每天读几百字的书，翻字典就得花两三个小时。还要死记背诵。这样，折磨了我好几年的光阴，却一点用处也没有。所以我对于现在要学生背诵一些夹有僵硬了的字句的古文学作品，很有反感。老一代的人坐过牢，难道一定要后一代的人也同样坐牢吗？
    我虽然很小就知道中医开方子，允许写白字，（即简字或错用字）叫“药白眼”；农民记日用账写白字，但总以为写“正体字”是应该的。1931年到洪湖苏区，那里的居民绝大多数是文盲，而要求学习文化又非常热烈，每个人都有“拍纸簿”和铅笔或自来水笔，一有空就学习。他们创造了不少新字，如团字、代（姓）字、斗（鬬）字等，我第一次在那里看见。还创造了一些新词儿：农民不大喜欢长的词儿，如过组织生活只叫“过生活”，组织介绍信叫“生活条子”等；也不喜欢含义不明的词儿，因而有些词儿，在那里变了样。
    我才知道不只字要改，首先是简化，而且知道我们的词儿也很贫乏，不只新的事物要有新词儿，就是在一般人民中日常事物中应用，也还要有很多创造。这就彻底打破了我对于旧文字的迷信。
    汉字简化还只是第一步工作，但在受过字难写的苦的人，看来是替子孙们做了一件好事。
    谈谈讲话罢！有这么一种习惯，同乡人见面，要讲土话，否则是“卖祖”。话是讲给人听的，为甚么要讲人家听不懂的话？
    我讲话的土音很重，曾去广播台讲话，我讲一遍，广播员替我翻一遍，多么使人难堪。平常的会议：我讲的人家不全懂，人家讲的我也不全懂，虽然对面，好像隔一层幕；如果是到农民群众中间、工人群众中间，那就不只隔一层幕而是隔一重山，简直无法开口。
    要开口就得找翻译，难道这样的情况也应该传之子孙吗？成年人学普通话有点难，青少年就很容易。几年以后至多十五年，就不是“书同文”而且是“语同音”了。
    读音统一，我们期望了多少年，但是和其他的愿望一样，只有在人民掌握自己的命运，在中国共产党领导下，才能迅速地完满地实现。
