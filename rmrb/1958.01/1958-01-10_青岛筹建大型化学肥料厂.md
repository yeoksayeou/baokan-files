Qingdao to Build Large-Scale Chemical Fertilizer Plant

Jinan, January 9th (By our newspaper) - Shandong Province's first large-scale chemical fertilizer plant, capable of producing 600,000 tons each of nitrogen fertilizer and soda ash annually, has begun construction preparations in Qingdao.

The raw materials required for this chemical fertilizer plant are mainly sea salt, which is abundant in Jiaozhou Bay near Qingdao. In order to supply agricultural fertilizer as soon as possible, the entire project will be constructed in phases, adopting the approach of simultaneous construction and production. It is expected that after the completion of the first phase of the project in 1960, the plant will be able to produce 70,000 tons of ammonium chloride (nitrogen fertilizer) and 70,000 tons of soda ash annually; after the completion of the second phase of expansion in 1963, it will be able to produce 160,000 tons of ammonium chloride and 160,000 tons of soda ash annually; after the entire plant is completed, it will be able to produce 600,000 tons each of ammonium chloride and soda ash annually.
