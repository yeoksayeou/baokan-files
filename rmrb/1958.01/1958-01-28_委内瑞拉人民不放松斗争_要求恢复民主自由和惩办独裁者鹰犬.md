Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, January 27th: Large-scale mass demonstrations continue on the streets of Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. The demonstrators are demanding the immediate restoration of democratic freedoms and the punishment of all those who collaborated with the dictator Jiménez. The masses are also continuing to spontaneously search throughout the country for secret police who abused political prisoners during the Jiménez dictatorship.

According to the Associated Press, some Venezuelan political activists who were forced into exile during the Jiménez dictatorship have returned to the country one after another. Among them are Jovito Villalba, leader of the Democratic Republican Union, and Gustavo Machado, Secretary of the Venezuelan Communist Party. In his first speech after returning to the country, Villalba welcomed some of the democratic measures taken by the military junta. He also said that the future president of Venezuela must be a civilian elected by the people of the whole country. If a soldier attempts to seize power, "we will not hesitate to shed blood to overthrow him." Villalba also condemned the US policy of supporting dictators like Jiménez in Latin American countries.

According to United Press International, the Venezuelan Journalists Association on the 26th demanded that the military junta abolish "all restrictive and repressive measures" taken by the Jiménez regime, which have not yet been announced for repeal by the military junta. The organization also demanded freedom of speech so that the people of the whole country can understand the national situation after the overthrow of the Jiménez regime.

    委内瑞拉人民不放松斗争
    要求恢复民主自由和惩办独裁者鹰犬
    据新华社27日讯　加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯的大街上继续有大规模的群众游行，游行群众要求立即恢复民主自由和惩办一切同独裁者希门尼斯合作过的人。群众还继续自发地在国内各地搜索在希门尼斯独裁统治时期虐待政治犯的秘密警察。
    据美联社报道，在希门尼斯独裁统治时期被迫逃亡国外的委内瑞拉某些政治活动家已经陆续回国，其中有共和民主联盟领导人约维托·维亚耳巴和委内瑞拉共产党书记古斯塔沃·马查多。维亚耳巴在回国后第一次发表的谈话中对军政府委员会采取的一些民主措施表示欢迎，他还说，今后的委内瑞拉总统必须由全国人民选举文职人员担任。假如一个军人企图夺取政权，“我们将不惜流血来推翻他”。维亚耳巴还谴责美国支持像希门尼斯这样的拉丁美洲国家独裁者的政策。
    据合众社报道，委内瑞拉记者协会26日要求军政府委员会废除希门尼斯政权采取的、而到现在还未经军政府委员会宣布废除的“一切限制和镇压措施”。这个组织还要求言论自由，以便使全国人民了解希门尼斯政权被推翻后的国家情况。
