    Splitting the Tianshan Ice Peaks, Connecting Southern and Northern Xinjiang
    Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Reopens the Uku Highway
    (This newspaper dispatch) The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, overcoming wind, snow, and extreme cold, and splitting through the Tianshan ice peaks at an altitude of over 4,000 meters, has once again reopened the Uku Highway from Urumqi to Korla.
    Xinjiang's industry is mostly concentrated in Northern Xinjiang, centered around Urumqi, while abundant iron ore and thriving agricultural and pastoral areas are mostly distributed in Korla and the Ulaste Chahan Grassland on the southern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains. Although the two places are only over 200 kilometers apart, they are separated by the steep Tianshan Mountains, making transportation extremely inconvenient.
    In 1952, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang basically completed the highway from Urumqi to Korla. However, due to incomplete information at the time, the roadbed was built too low, and later the road was washed away by flash floods.
    In August 1956, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region decided to rebuild the Uku Highway, and the road-building army of the Production and Construction Corps entered the Tianshan Mountains in November of that year. At that time, it was the season of wind, snow, and freezing temperatures, transportation in the mountains was inconvenient, there were few inhabitants, and material conditions were extremely difficult. The road-building troops dug open mountain slopes and used Tianshan pine trees to build "dugouts"; without beds, they piled pebbles on ice blocks and covered them with felt to spend the night; without pots, they set up washbasins to boil water to drink. The mountains were high and the air was thin, and sometimes the water would not boil and the food would not cook. Steamed buns and boiling water were delivered by donkey from the foot of the mountain twenty miles away, but once they were transported to the mountain they became "iron lumps" and ice blocks. The road-building army overcame all kinds of difficulties and established construction sites in the Tianshan Mountains.
    The road construction project officially started in March 1957. Braving the occasional attacks of floods and hailstorms in July, the road-building troops drilled and blasted on cliffs, completing many dangerous projects. At a place one hundred kilometers from Urumqi, there is an ice sheet, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level, and is covered with ice all year round. Heavy snow often falls even in August. The road-building heroes pried open the three-foot-thick ice layer and dug a stone trough 76 meters long, 40 meters wide, and 27 meters deep in the hard granite mountain peak, cutting off the Tianshan Mountains and allowing cars to pass through the highest point of the Tianshan Mountains from here.
    In the process of construction, the road-building troops displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and launched a vigorous competition, and the project progressed extremely rapidly. The first phase of the project (from Urumqi to Motoshala Iron Mine) involved a total of 5.15 million cubic meters of earth and stone work and more than 200 bridges and culverts, which was completed at the end of 1957. The road from Urumqi to the Motoshala mining area has been opened to traffic, and a large amount of iron ore has been continuously transported from here to the August 1st Iron and Steel Plant in Northern Xinjiang. The section from Motoshala mining area to Korla was originally passable, but needed to be repaired and reinforced. The second phase of the project also started successively in October last year, and is expected to be completed in May this year.
    The newly built Uku Highway is 317 kilometers long and is a first-class highway that can be safely used all year round. Its completion will greatly facilitate transportation between Southern and Northern Xinjiang and promote the development of industry and agriculture in Xinjiang. Transportation between Southern and Northern Xinjiang via the Uku Highway is 164 kilometers shorter than the original detour via Toksun. The ore transportation cost for the August 1st Iron and Steel Plant alone can be reduced by 4.37 million yuan per month.

### 劈开天山冰峰　沟通南疆北疆  新疆建设兵团再次修通乌库公路

    劈开天山冰峰　沟通南疆北疆
    新疆建设兵团再次修通乌库公路
    本报讯　中国人民解放军新疆生产建设兵团，战胜风雪奇寒，劈开拔海四千多公尺的天山冰峰，再次修通了乌鲁木齐至库尔勒的乌库公路。
    新疆的工业大都集中在以乌鲁木齐为中心的北疆，而丰富的铁矿和繁盛的农牧区大都分布在天山南麓的库尔勒和乌拉斯台查汗大草原。两地相距虽只二百多公里，但被险峻的天山阻隔，交通极为不便。
    1952年驻新疆的人民解放军，曾基本上修通由乌鲁木齐到库尔勒的公路。但是，由于当时资料不全，路基修得太低，以后因山洪暴发，路被冲垮了。
    1956年8月，新疆维吾尔自治区决定重修乌库公路，生产建设兵团筑路大军就在当年11月开进天山。那时，正是风雪交加、滴水成冰的季节，山里交通不便，人烟稀少，物质条件极端困难。筑路部队挖开山坡，利用天山松树搭起“地窝子”；没有床，就在冰块上垒起卵石再铺上毡子过夜；没有锅，就架起脸盆烧水喝。山高空气稀薄，有时烧不开水，做不熟饭，从二十里外山脚下用毛驴送来馍馍和开水，但一运到山上就成了“铁疙瘩”和冰块。筑路大军克服了种种困难，在天山上建立了工地。
    筑路工程自1957年3月正式开工。筑路部队冒着7月的洪水和冰雹不时的袭击，在悬崖上打眼爆破，完成了许多险峻的工程。在距离乌鲁木齐一百公里地方，有一个冰大板，这里拔海四千多公尺，终年冰封三尺，8月间还经常下大雪。筑路的英雄们撬开三尺厚的冰层，在坚硬的花岗石山峰中挖开一个七十六公尺长，四十公尺宽，深达二十七公尺的石槽，腰斩了天山，让汽车从这里通过天山最高点。
    筑路部队在施工过程中，发挥了高度的积极性，展开了热火朝天的竞赛活动，工程进展极为迅速。第一期工程（由乌鲁木齐至莫托沙拉铁矿）共有五百一十五万土石方工程，二百多座桥梁涵洞，已在1957年底完成，乌鲁木齐到莫托沙拉矿区业已通车，大量铁矿石已从 这里源源运往北疆的八一钢铁厂。莫托沙拉矿区到库尔勒原可通车，但需要整修加固。第二期工程也于去年10月陆续开工，预计今年5月完成。
    新建的乌库公路全长三百一十七公里，是一条头等公路，可以终年安全通车。它建成后将大大便利于南北疆的交通，促进新疆工农业的发展。南北疆之间经由乌库公路运输，比原来绕道托克逊要近一百六十四公里。仅是八一钢铁厂一个厂的矿石运输费，每个月就可以节约四百三十七万元。
