Thorough Rectification, Extensive Propaganda, Organized Competition
Shanghai Machine Tool Plant Systematically Promotes Production Upsurge

　　(Our Dispatch) According to the *Jiefang Daily*, the leadership of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, in order to promote the formation of a new upsurge in production, has put forward a specific plan after careful consideration.
　　This plan was formulated after collective research. Participants in the research included the leaders of the plant's Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, as well as the chief engineer, chief designer, chief process engineer, and heads of the production and planning departments. They jointly studied the characteristics of the new production upsurge and the production situation in 1958, and then determined the plan. This plan has been conveyed to nearly two hundred foremen and group leaders throughout the plant, and the Party committee has also made special arrangements for the branch secretaries.
　　According to the plan, the plant's leaders at all levels will first continue to resolutely and thoroughly carry out rectification. The plan points out that this is the primary key to whether a production upsurge can form and be sustained and consolidated.
　　Vigorously launching propaganda and mobilization work is the second part of the plan. The plant has already held various types of symposiums and is about to hold a celebration meeting for the victorious completion of the First Five-Year Plan and the 1957 National Plan. It plans to use an exhibition to publicize the plant's implementation of the First Five-Year Plan to the workers. Through these activities, the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Trade Union and the Central Committee's call to catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in about fifteen years will be widely publicized, as well as the achievements and existing problems of the plant in implementing the First Five-Year Plan and the future goals of efforts, so that all workers can clarify the direction, improve their thinking, improve their work, boost their morale, launch an upsurge, and create new achievements.
　　In order to promote a production upsurge, the plant has decided to strengthen the organization and leadership of production competitions, launch a "Five Comparisons" competition among production workers, comparing breakthroughs in quotas, quality, solving key problems, saving, and safety and equipment maintenance; launch a "Five Guarantees" competition among technical personnel, guaranteeing diligence and frugality, guaranteeing unity and cooperation, guaranteeing learning from advanced techniques, guaranteeing work effectiveness, and guaranteeing trial production of new products; and formulate a "Five Good" convention for building socialism among workshops and teams, guaranteeing being good at diligence and thrift, good at strengthening unity and mutual assistance, good at learning technology and culture, good at observing labor discipline and safety, and good at participating in social activities. In addition, it is also necessary to launch a rationalization proposal campaign to solve key production problems.
　　The plan also proposes to strengthen the inspection and summary of competitions and the promotion of advanced experience, and to give full play to the role of employee representatives.
　　Now, the plant is carrying out various publicity activities, evaluating and rewarding advanced producers and advanced workers in 1957, organizing the first quarter and January socialist competitions, and continuing to carry out thorough rectification.

    彻底整改　广泛宣传　组织竞赛
    上海机床厂有计划地促进生产高潮
    本报讯　据解放日报报道：上海机床厂领导人员为促进生产新高潮的形成，经过周密考虑，提出了一项具体的规划。
    这个规划是经过集体研究后制订出来的。参加研究的有这个厂的党、行政、工会、共青团的领导人员和总工程师、总设计师、总工艺师、生产和计划科长。他们共同研究了生产新高潮的特点和1958年的生产形势，然后确定了规划。这个规划已经传达到全厂近二百个工长和组长以上的干部，党委也向支部书记专门做了布置。
    根据规划，这个厂的各级领导将首先继续坚决彻底地狠狠整改。规划里指出，这是生产高潮能否形成和持久巩固的首要关键。
    大力展开宣传鼓动工作是规划的第二部分。这个厂已经召开了各种类型的座谈会，即将举行胜利完成第一个五年计划和1957年国家计划的庆功大会；准备把厂里执行第一个五年计划的情况等用展览会形式向职工宣传。通过这些活动，广泛宣传工会“八大”的精神和党中央提出的十五年左右在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国的号召，宣传厂里实行第一个五年计划的成绩和存在的问题以及今后的努力目标，使全体职工明确方向，提高思想，改进工作，鼓起干劲，掀起高潮，创造新成绩。
    为了促进生产高潮，厂里决定加强生产竞赛的组织领导，在生产工人中开展比突破定额、比质量、比解决关键、比节约、比安全和设备保养的“五比”竞赛；在技职人员中开展保证勤俭节约、保证团结协作、保证学习先进、保证工作效果、保证新产品试制的“五保”竞赛；并在工段班组之间制订保证勤俭节约好、加强团结互助好、学习技术文化好、遵守劳动纪律安全好、参加社会活动好的建设社会主义“五好”公约。此外，还要开展合理化建议课题运动，解决生产关键问题。
    规划里还提出要加强竞赛的检查总结和先进经验的推广工作，并要发挥职工代表的作用。
    现在，这个厂正通过各种宣传活动，评比和奖励1957年度先进生产者和先进工作者，组织第一季度和1月份的社会主义竞赛，并继续狠狠进行整改。
