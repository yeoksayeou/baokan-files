Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, 23rd - Following the general strike and massive popular resistance movement against the Jiménez dictatorial regime that erupted in Venezuela on the 21st, the Jiménez government was overthrown this morning after two days of fierce struggle. Jiménez himself fled to Trujillo City, the capital of the Dominican Republic, by plane at 3:00 AM this morning. The "Civil-Military Committee" leading the coup has appointed a "Five-Man Military Government" headed by Rear Admiral Larrazábal.

It is reported that before his downfall, Jiménez was under immense pressure. Not only did the broad masses launch large-scale resistance, but later the government's army, navy, air force, and military academy also jointly expressed their opposition to Jiménez continuing in power. A group of officers sent Jiménez an "ultimatum," demanding that he resign immediately.

Before fleeing, Jiménez attempted to suppress the mass movement in Venezuela by force on the 21st and 22nd. According to statistics, the troops and police he dispatched killed 145 demonstrators and injured more than 600. On the 22nd, demonstrators seized weapons from the police and army and fought the government. The fighting was most intense in the industrial areas of Caracas, where gunshots could be heard everywhere, and the smell of gunpowder filled the city.

When news of the overthrow of the Jiménez government spread, residents of Caracas poured into the streets to cheer. In some places, the crowds were so dense that residents on the street could not open their doors to go out, and many people shouted from the windows, "The tyrant has been overthrown! The tyrant has been overthrown!" Thousands of cars also drove into the streets and honked their horns in celebration.

The news pointed out that the anti-Jiménez movement in Venezuela erupted because the American monopoly capital's plunder of the country's resources aroused strong popular dissatisfaction, and Jiménez was precisely a puppet of American monopoly capital, who made a fortune by selling out the wealth of the Venezuelan people.

The mass movement against the Jiménez dictatorial regime erupted in Venezuela on the 21st. Although a large number of tanks guarded the presidential palace, they could not protect the reactionary government.

    委内瑞拉人民奋起打倒暴君
    美国傀儡希门尼斯逃命国外
    新华社23日讯　加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉自从21日爆发反对希门尼斯独裁政权的总罢工和声势浩大的群众性反抗运动以后，经过两天激烈的斗争，希门尼斯政府已经在今晨被推翻。希门尼斯本人在今晨三时乘飞机逃到多米尼加共和国首都特鲁希约城。领导政变的“民政—军事委员会”已经指派了以海军少将拉腊萨巴耳为首的一个“五人军事政府”。
    据报道，希门尼斯在倒台之前受到强大的压力，不仅广大群众展开了大规模的反抗，后来政府的海陆空军和军官学校也都联合起来表示反对希门尼斯继续当政。一批军官给希门尼斯送去一个“最后通牒”，要他马上辞职。
    希门尼斯在逃亡以前曾经在21日和22日企图用武力镇压委内瑞拉的群众运动。据统计，他派遣的军队和警察打死了示威群众一百四十五人，打伤的群众有六百多人。22日，示威群众从警察和军队手中夺来了武器同政府进行战斗。在加拉加斯的工业区战斗最为激烈，到处都可以听到枪声，弹药烟火的气味弥漫了全城。
  当希门尼斯政府被推翻的消息传出后，加拉加斯居民涌到街上欢呼，有些地方人群的拥挤使临街居民不能开门外出，许多人从楼窗内高呼“暴君被打倒了！暴君被打倒了！”成千辆汽车也驶入大街并且鸣喇叭表示庆祝。
    消息指出，委内瑞拉爆发反希门尼斯运动是由于美国垄断资本掠夺这个国家资源的情况引起了人民强烈的不满，而希门尼斯正是美国垄断资本的傀儡，他靠出卖委内瑞拉人民的财富发财致富。
    委内瑞拉从21日爆发了反对希门尼斯独裁政权的群众运动，总统府前虽有大量坦克戒备，但也保卫不住反动的政府。
