A compilation of reports from our newspaper: Xinhua News Agency dispatch: US newspapers continue to call on Washington to reconsider its attitude on disarmament and to negotiate with the Soviet Union.

The "Boston Globe" stated on the 28th that the National Security Council, the decision-making body of the US government, should "re-examine the US stance on disarmament." The newspaper pointed out that Stassen had already proposed changing this attitude.

The "Boston Globe" is a newspaper associated with Stassen. Sources say that despite strong opposition from Dulles and other influential figures in the US government, Stassen currently maintains that a "more flexible" attitude should be adopted when holding disarmament talks with the Soviet Union, and that the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe should be seriously studied.

The "San Francisco Chronicle" said that the United States cannot avoid negotiating with the Soviet Union, and that the United States should immediately express its willingness to discuss and negotiate on disarmament issues based on the seven-point proposal put forward by the Soviet Union.

The "New York Post" expressed regret over the State Department's negative stance on disarmament and peace issues. The newspaper wrote: "No news clearly indicating Western concern for peace has come from Washington."

The "Washington Post and Times Herald" expressed distrust of the State Department. The newspaper believes that the United States must "make new efforts" on the issue of disarmament.

Senate Majority Assistant Leader, Democratic Senator Mansfield, advocated ambassador-level talks with the Soviet Union on the 29th. He said that if such talks prove promising, then higher-level talks could be considered. He believes that due to the development of Soviet science and technology, "the United States is currently weaker than the Soviet Union." He said that the Soviet intercontinental missiles have changed the attitude of Western European countries towards the United States.

    美报要求同苏联谈判
    曼斯菲尔德主张先进行大使级会谈
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国报纸继续要求华盛顿当局重新考虑对裁军问题的态度，并且同苏联进行谈判。
    “波士顿环球报”28日说：美国政府的决策机构国家安全委员会应该“重新研究美国在裁军问题上的态度”。报纸指出，史塔生已经提出了改变这种态度的主张。
    “波士顿环球报”是一家同史塔生有关系的报纸。有消息说，尽管杜勒斯及美国政府里其他有势力人士在强烈反对，史塔生目前仍然主张同苏联举行裁军谈判时要采取“灵活一些”的态度，并且认为应该认真研究关于在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议。
    “旧金山纪事报”说，美国不能不同苏联举行谈判，而且美国应该立即表示愿意根据苏联提出的七点建议就裁军问题进行讨论和谈判。
    “纽约邮报”对国务院在裁军和和平问题上所抱的消极立场表示遗憾。这家报纸写道：“从华盛顿没有传来任何明显地表明西方关心和平的消息”。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”表示不信任国务院。这家报纸认为美国必须在裁军问题上“作出新的努力”。
    参议院多数党助理领袖、民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德29日主张同苏联进行大使级会谈。他说，倘若这种会谈表明有希望，那就可以考虑举行更高级的会谈。他认为，由于苏联科学技术的发展，“目前美国比苏联弱”。他说，苏联的洲际导弹已经使西欧国家对美国的态度改变了。
