Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Indonesian President Sukarno said at a banquet given by the Pakistani President on the 20th: "We are committed to human friendship, peaceful coexistence, and non-alignment, and therefore we are also engaged in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism."

Sukarno also said: "We believe that two camps can coexist. Facts have already proven that this coexistence can exist. But there can be no coexistence between colonizers and colonized peoples. We Indonesians will strive to fight imperialism."

President Sukarno arrived in Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, on the 20th for a visit. He was warmly welcomed at the airport by Pakistani President Mirza and residents.

Prior to this, Sukarno arrived in Damascus, the capital of Syria, from Belgrade on the 19th. He was welcomed at the airport by Syrian President Kuwatly, Speaker of Parliament Hourani, Prime Minister Asali, other senior officials, and foreign diplomatic envoys. Outside the airport, about 10,000 people waved flags and shouted slogans such as "West Irian belongs to you" and "Down with colonialism" to welcome him.

That evening, President Kuwatly held a state banquet to welcome President Sukarno. President Kuwatly said in his speech at the banquet that Syria wholeheartedly supports Indonesia's just cause of obtaining its full sovereignty and the happiness and prosperity of the Indonesian people.

President Sukarno said in his reply that there is unity between the people of our two countries, that both of our countries adhere to a policy of active neutrality, coexistence, and the right of all nations to self-determination, and that we are both advancing from this foundation and relying on this policy to achieve our goals.

Six hours after President Sukarno left Damascus, the Syrian News Agency published a press release on the talks between Indonesian President Sukarno and Syrian President Kuwatly. The communique stated that the two presidents unanimously agreed to support Indonesia's rights in West Irian, as well as all the national rights and aspirations of the Arab people. The communique also stated that the other four points agreed upon by the two presidents were: to strengthen the brotherly friendly relations between the two countries and cooperation in all aspects of international affairs for the benefit of both countries; to adhere to a policy of active neutrality and non-alignment, and to support the right of national self-determination; to refuse to participate in military treaties, because this practice is not for maintaining peace and saving peace; and to condemn nuclear weapons testing.

The press release also stated that President Kuwatly had accepted President Sukarno's invitation to visit Indonesia this year.

    苏加诺总统在卡拉奇说
    两个阵营可以共处
    但殖民地人民和殖民者不能共处
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：印度尼西亚总统苏加诺20日晚在巴基斯坦总统的宴会上说：“我们致力于人类的友爱、和平共处和不参加集团，因而也进行反对殖民主义和帝国主义的斗争。”
    苏加诺还说：“我们相信两个阵营可以共处。事实已经证明，这种共处可以存在。但是在殖民者和殖民地人民之间不能有共处。我们印度尼西亚人将努力对帝国主义进行斗争。”
    苏加诺总统是在20日到达巴基斯坦首都卡拉奇访问的。他在飞机场受到巴基斯坦总统米尔扎和居民的热烈欢迎。
    在这之前，苏加诺在19日从贝尔格莱德到达叙利亚首都大马士革。他在机场受到叙利亚总统库阿特利、议会议长胡拉尼、总理阿萨利和其他高级官员以及各国外交使节的欢迎。在机场外面，约有一万人挥舞着旗帜、高呼着“西伊里安是你们的”、“打倒殖民主义”等口号欢迎他。
    当天晚上，库阿特利总统举行国宴欢迎苏加诺总统。库阿特利总统在宴会上致词的时候说，叙利亚衷心支持印度尼西亚获得它的完全的主权和印度尼西亚人民的幸福和繁荣的正义事业。
    苏加诺总统在答辞中说，我们两国人民之间存在着团结，我们两国都坚持积极中立政策、共处和各民族的自决权，我们都从这一基础出发向前进展，并且依靠这一政策来实现我们的目标。
    在苏加诺总统离开大马士革六小时后，叙利亚新闻局发表了关于印度尼西亚总统苏加诺和叙利亚总统库阿特利会谈的新闻公报。公报说，两位总统一致同意，支持印度尼西亚在西伊里安的权利，以及阿拉伯人的所有的民族权利和愿望。公报还说，两位总统一致同意的其他四点是：加强两国间兄弟般的友好关系和在国际事务各方面为了两国的利益而进行的合作；坚持积极中立政策和不参加集团政策，并且支持民族自决权利；拒绝参加军事条约，因为这种做法不是为了维护和平和拯救和平；谴责核武器试验。
    新闻公报还说，库阿特利总统已经接受了苏加诺总统的邀请，将在今年访问印度尼西亚。
