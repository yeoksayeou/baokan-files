Editor's Note:

    Solving the ideological problems of transferred cadres through extensive debates is a good method. However, it should not be regarded as the only method. Some ideological problems among transferred cadres cannot be solved solely through extensive debates. The reason is simple: there are all kinds of people among the transferred cadres. They have common ideological problems, but also different ideological problems. Regarding the issue of cadre transfer, veteran cadres have their views, new cadres have their views, intellectuals have their views, worker-peasant cadres have their views, and female cadres have their views. In addition, everyone has their own personality. Some people like to talk about their ideological situation at large meetings, some like to talk about their ideological problems with their close friends, some are only willing to talk about their thoughts to familiar leading cadres, and some are only willing to talk to higher-level leading cadres. Extensive debates can only debate a few general issues, thus only solving common ideological problems and not solving different ideological problems.

    Perhaps some will say: as long as the common ideological problems are solved, the specific ideological problems of each individual can be easily solved. This has some truth, but it is not entirely so. Some people understand the grand principles, but do not understand all the specific issues; some people have understood the principles in theory, but their thinking becomes muddled when they encounter practical problems. At the same time, specific ideological problems are not completely the same as common ideological problems. For example, a few intellectuals with strong professional skills, although agreeing that intellectuals should go down to temper themselves, believe that they have strong professional skills and do not need to go down to temper themselves.

    Perhaps some will say: these specific ideological problems can be solved in practice in the future. It is impossible to solve all ideological problems well before the transfer. However, if ideological problems have already been discovered, they should still be resolved. Otherwise, they will treat these ideological problems as burdens. With burdens, no matter how small, they will hinder them from participating in labor training.

    To solve the different ideological problems of each individual, we must adopt the method of individual talks, as the Ministry of Labor has done. According to the experience of the Ministry of Labor, after adopting this method, many ideological problems and specific difficulties that people were unwilling to expose at large meetings were exposed. In this way, the leadership can help them solve these problems. If one talk doesn't solve it, then talk twice; if two talks don't solve it, then talk three times, or even four or five times... with a sincere and patient attitude, until it is preliminarily resolved. A few people frowned at the beginning of the talks, but in the end, they smiled and actively requested to be transferred.

    The practice of the Ministry of Labor is worth noting by all localities.

### 做好个别思想工作

    做好个别思想工作
    通过大辩论来解决下放干部的思想问题，是一个好方法。但是，也不应当把它当成唯一的方法，下放干部中间有些思想问题，仅仅通过大辩论是不能解决的。道理很简单：下放干部当中有各式各样的人，他们有共同的思想问题，也有不同的思想问题。对干部下放问题，老干部有老干部的看法，新干部有新干部的看法，知识分子有知识分子的看法，工农干部有工农干部的看法，女干部又有女干部的看法。另外每个人又有自己的性格，有的人喜欢在大会上谈自己的思想情况，有的人喜欢和自己的知己朋友谈自己的思想问题，也有人只愿意对熟悉的领导干部谈自己的思想，也有人只愿意向高一级的领导干部谈自己的思想。大辩论只能辩论几个普遍性的问题，因此只能解决共同的思想问题，不能解决不同的思想问题。
    也许有人会说：只要解决了共同的思想问题，各个人的具体思想问题就可以迎刃而解，这有一定的道理，但也不尽如此。有些人对大道理想通了，但具体问题并不都通；有些人在道理上虽然弄通了，在接触到实际问题时，思想又不通了。同时，具体思想问题，总和共同的思想问题不完全一样，例如有少数业务工作能力较强的知识分子，虽然同意知识分子要下去锻炼，却又认为自己业务工作能力很强，不必下去锻炼了。
    也许有人会说：这些具体思想问题，将来可在实践中去解决。在下放之前，把所有思想问题都解决得很好是不可能的。但是，已经发现有思想问题，还是应该解决。否则，他们就会把这些思想问题当成包袱，有了包袱，不管大小，都会妨碍他们参加劳动锻炼。
    要解决每个人的不同的思想问题，就要像劳动部采取个别谈话的方式。根据劳动部的经验，采用这个方法以后，不少人在大会上不愿意暴露的思想问题和具体困难，都暴露出来了。这样，领导方面就可以帮助他们来解决这些问题。谈一次解决不了，就谈两次，谈两次解决不了，就谈三次，甚至四次，五次……，态度恳切，不厌其烦，直到初步解决为止。少数人在开始谈的时候愁眉苦脸，最后却是眉开眼笑，积极要求下放。
    劳动部的做法，是值得各地注意的。
