Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: Since the start of winter, the schistosomiasis epidemic areas across the country have launched a vigorous schistosomiasis prevention campaign, riding on the momentum of the Great Leap Forward in production.

During this period, under the leadership of local Party committees, the broad masses in various regions have combined schistosomiasis prevention with projects such as water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, creating unprecedentedly favorable conditions for prevention work. The Central Committee's Nine-Person Group for Schistosomiasis Prevention also holds weekly telephone conferences to strengthen leadership.

Currently, in Huanggang Prefecture, Hubei Province alone, 160,000 people have been mobilized to participate in the snail eradication campaign. To date, the area where snails have been eradicated has reached over 120 million square meters. This figure is equivalent to four times the total snail eradication area in the region over the past year and nine months; in essence, they have accomplished seven years' worth of work in one winter. In Anhui Province, in the first ten days of this year, over 130,000 people were mobilized, and the snail eradication area exceeded 110 million square meters. In Shanghai, more than 40,000 soldiers and civilians participating in the snail eradication work have been working day and night in sub-zero temperatures using over 100 water pumps to drain the water from snail-infested ditches and eliminate snails above and below the waterline. Haining County, Zhejiang Province, one of the areas most severely affected by schistosomiasis, has decided to completely eliminate snails this year. Nineteen of the county's twenty-two townships have already completed snail eradication in ditches. In the past two months, the county has opened up more than 8,000 snail eradication ditches, and the area where snails have been buried in soil exceeds 2.4 million square meters.

During this period, Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, combined snail eradication with fertilizer accumulation, accumulating enough fertilizer to fertilize 50,594 mu of land, while also expanding arable land by 238 mu, dredging 100,000 meters of rivers and irrigation ditches, and catching 12,672 jin of fish. The masses said: This is truly achieving five goals with one action.

Anhui Province also combined the fertilizer accumulation campaign with the management of manure, increasing the number of households managing manure by 50,000. They also managed the manure of fishermen on 20,000 boats and collected over 540,000 dan of wild animal manure, increasing fertilizer accumulation and eliminating schistosomiasis eggs. Jiangsu Province also restored manure management in 103 townships and 487 agricultural cooperatives.

Due to the greatly enhanced awareness of prevention and treatment personnel after the anti-Rightist struggle, the phenomenon of time wasted in treating diseases in the past has been basically eliminated. Treatment teams in various regions have adopted organizational treatment forms that are convenient for the masses and involve mobile stations in the communes, and have promoted the three-day short-course therapy with antimony agents, which has improved the quality of treatment. Sichuan Province organized thousands of Chinese and Western medical personnel to form prevention and treatment teams and conducted treatment in depth in townships and communes, or adopted the method of stationed commune mobile treatment.

At the end of last year, after the nine counties and suburbs that had basically eliminated schistosomiasis nationwide, Shaoxing City, Zhejiang Province, announced that it had treated all treatable schistosomiasis patients, reached the standard of basically no snails, completely managed manure, and basically eliminated schistosomiasis. Daye County, Hubei Province, also announced the basic elimination of snails. Tongshan, Yuan'an, Dangyang, Nanzhang, and other counties in Hubei also strive to become basically snail-free counties before the Spring Festival. During the same period, seven basically snail-free counties and thirty-nine basically snail-free townships emerged in Jiangxi Province.

Currently, some backward regions are catching up with advanced regions, and the entire schistosomiasis prevention campaign is developing universally and in depth.

    群策群力　灭尽钉螺
    全国防治血吸虫病运动热火朝天
    据新华社24日讯　入冬以来，全国血吸虫病流行地区随着生产大跃进的劲头，防治血吸虫病的运动也搞得火热朝天。
    这一时期，各地广大群众在当地党委领导下，把防治血吸虫病的工作同兴修水利、积肥等工作结合起来，给防治工作带来了空前有利的条件。中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组也每周召开电话会议，加强领导。
    目前，湖北省仅黄冈一个专区，就发动起十六万人投入灭螺运动，到现在灭螺面积已达一亿二千多万平方公尺。这个数字等于这个地区过去一年又九个月的灭螺面积总和的四倍，细算起来是一冬干了七年的活。安徽省在今年头十天中，就动员了十三万人次，灭螺面积有一亿一千多万平方公尺。上海市参加灭螺工作的军、民四万多人，连日来在零度下的气温中用一百多部抽水机昼夜不停的工作，他们要把有螺沟渠的水吸干，消灭水线上下的钉螺。浙江省血吸虫病流行最严重的地区之一——海宁县，已决定在今年内全部消灭钉螺。这个县二十二个乡，已经有十九个乡完成了水沟灭螺。两个月来，全县共开辟了八千多条灭螺沟，土埋钉螺的面积有二百四十多万平方公尺。
    这个时期，江苏省江都县结合灭螺工作，所积的肥和所造的肥够五万零五百九十四亩地施肥之用，同时扩大耕地面积二百三十八亩，疏通河道和灌溉沟十万公尺，并且捉到鱼一万二千六百七十二斤。群众说：这正是一举五得。
    安徽结合积肥运动还进行了管理粪便，增加了粪管户五万户，还把二万只船上渔民的粪便也管了起来，拣拾野畜粪五十四万多担，增积了肥料，又消灭了血吸虫卵。江苏省也恢复了一百零三个乡和四百八十七个农业社的粪便管理。
    各地的治疗工作，由于防治人员经过反右斗争，觉悟大大提高，基本上消灭了过去治病窝工的现象。各地治疗组都采取了便利群众、巡回驻社的组织治疗形式，推广了锑剂三日短程疗法，治疗的质量也有所提高。四川省组织了上千名中西医务人员，组成防治小组，深入乡、社或采用驻社巡回治疗的方法进行治疗。
    去年年底，浙江省绍兴市继全国九个基本消灭血吸虫病县和郊区之后宣布：已治完了一切可治的血吸虫病人，达到基本无螺的标准，全部管好了粪便，基本消灭了血吸虫病。湖北省的大冶县也宣布基本消灭了钉螺。还有湖北通山、远安、当阳、南漳等县也争取在春节之前成为基本无螺县。同一时期内，江西省涌现出来七个基本无螺县和三十九个基本无螺乡。
    目前，一些落后地区正向先进地区赶上，整个防治血吸虫病运动正在普遍深入发展。
