Thousands of Heroes Fight at the Yili River Hydropower Station
	Sending off the Last Day with Double the Labor
	On the morning of December 31st, as the mountains were just beginning to show their vague outlines, the Yili River valley was still brightly illuminated by powerful floodlights. An hour before work began, young concrete pouring workers, braving the cold wind, strode onto the dam of the second-stage power station. Drill operators descended along the seventy-plus-meter-deep shaft to the underground powerhouse construction site. Along the Yili River, for tens of kilometers of the power station construction site, thousands of workers began their work early today. All the machines were running. From all sides of the valley came a tremendous roar.
	Today, every section and team on the construction site is making a final effort to fulfill its promise of exceeding this year's plan. The original drilling team of the underground powerhouse circumference completed sixteen hours of work in five hours. All the muck removal teams exceeded their quota of thirty truckloads today, generally reaching fifty or more truckloads. The concrete pouring work of the dam section also exceeded the recent record of two hundred cubic meters per day, reaching over three hundred cubic meters.
	Throughout the entire construction site of the Yili River Hydropower Station, all employees reaped a huge harvest of labor today—one day's work exceeded the average workload of two days in the second quarter of this year, exceeding the annual plan for this year by 2%.

    几千个好汉战斗在以礼河电站
    用双倍的劳动送走最后一天
    31日清早，山峦刚刚呈现出模糊的轮廓，以礼河谷依然被强力灯光照耀得通亮，离上班时间还差一小时，青年混凝土浇灌工们就迎着冷风，健步跨上了二级电站的拦河坝；风钻手们顺着七十多公尺深的竖井下到了地下厂房工地。沿以礼河几十公里的电站工地上，几千工人提前开始了今天的劳动。所有的机器都开动了。从河谷的四面传来了巨大的轰隆声。
    今天，工地上的每个工段、班组的职工，都在最后努力实现着他们超额完成今年计划的诺言。地下厂房的周长原打钻班以五个小时完成了十六个小时的工作量。所有的出碴班，今天都超过了三十车的定额，普遍达到了五十车以上。拦河坝工段混凝土浇灌工作也以三百多立方的纪录，超过了不久前达到每天二百立方的纪录。
    在以礼河水电站的整个工地上，全体职工今天获得了劳动的巨大丰收——一天的工作超过了今年第二季度平均两天的工作量，超额2％完成了今年的年度计划。
