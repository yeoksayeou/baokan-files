Sugarcane

Sugarcane is a tropical plant that loves warmth and humidity. More than a dozen provinces in southern China grow sugarcane. Taiwan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Sichuan provinces have the highest yields.

The "calories" contained in sugarcane are very high, more than three times that of grain crops.

"Sugarcane has no waste"! In addition to being made into white crystalline sugar, sugarcane residue can be used to make paper, soundproof fiberboard, and as a raw material for plastics. In addition, it can also produce valuable by-products such as yeast, cane wax, scouring powder, glycerin, butanol, acetone, citric acid, gluconic acid, etc.

Sugarcane is also a plant with strong resistance to adversity. Experienced farmers often use it as a pioneer crop in the early stages of land reclamation.

After liberation, sugarcane production has achieved rapid recovery and development. In 1956, the output reached more than 8.6 million tons, an increase of more than 2.2 times compared with 1949. In recent years, rural sugar consumption has also increased significantly. According to statistics, the average rural sugar consumption per person in 1956 reached 1.7 jin, an increase of 466.7% compared with 1949.

    甘蔗
    甘蔗是喜温喜湿的热带植物。我国南方十几个省均植有甘蔗。其中以台湾、广东、广西、福建、四川等省产量最多。
    甘蔗所含的“热量”很高，高出粮食作物三倍以上。
    “甘蔗一身无废物”！除了可以制成白晶晶的砂糖外，蔗渣可以造纸，可以造隔音的纤维板，作为塑料的原料。此外还可以生酵母、蔗腊、去污粉、甘油、丁醇、丙酮、柠檬酸、葡萄糖酸等等有价值的副产品。
    甘蔗还是一种抗逆性较强的植物。有经验的农民在开荒初期，常把它作为开荒的先锋作物。
    解放后，甘蔗生产获得了迅速的恢复和发展，1956年产量达到了八百六十多万吨，比1949年增加了二点二倍多。几年来农村食糖消费量也有显著增长，据统计，1956年农村每人平均食糖消费量达一点七斤，比1949年增加了466.7％。
