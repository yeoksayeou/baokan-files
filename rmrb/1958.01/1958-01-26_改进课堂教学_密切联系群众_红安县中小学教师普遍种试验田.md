Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 25th: Teachers in primary and secondary schools in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, have extensively launched activities to plant experimental plots, and have achieved good results.

The planting of experimental plots by teachers in primary and secondary schools in Hong'an County began during the winter production season. According to recent statistics, more than 1,100 primary and secondary school teachers in the county have planted more than 250 mu of experimental plots of various crops. Teachers use their spare time to plant these fields with commune cadres or members, learning production knowledge from the masses. Teachers at Zheng Bigao Primary School in Yuanhe Township planted two mu of experimental plots. They signed a contract with the production team in the commune, and each production activity was specifically assisted by experienced old farmers. As a result, these teachers were full of enthusiasm. The cultivation, sowing, and nurturing of the experimental plots were all done well, and they had a very good influence among the masses.

Although the teachers have participated in this activity for a short time, they have already benefited. Teachers at Zhangshihe Primary School in Lianshan Township have enriched their agricultural knowledge through cultivating experimental plots, making classroom teaching colorful, vivid, and lively, which has been universally welcomed by students. Because teachers adhere to teaching while working, changing the past style of being divorced from the masses, they have also rapidly improved the relationship between the school and the masses. In many places, the masses have automatically helped the school solve the difficulties of activity venues and student experimental gardens. The masses are more concerned about the school than before. The office expenses of the Sanshengan Primary School in Tanshu Township were insufficient, so the two nearby agricultural cooperatives decided to allocate ten yuan to the school each semester for office expenses. The school building of Chaomenkou Primary School in Dahu Township collapsed, and the nearby agricultural cooperative immediately took out 130 yuan and helped the members repair it, which was repaired in less than a week. In the past, schools such as Xia Li'an and Chen Tongfu in Fenggang Township had difficulty collecting tuition and miscellaneous fees, but now the commune automatically collects them on their behalf, reducing a lot of trouble for the schools. Many agricultural cooperatives also automatically help schools make desks and chairs and add teaching and sports equipment, and so on.

The activity of teachers planting experimental plots also plays a great role in inspiring students to love labor. Driven by the teachers' cultivation of experimental plots, students at Bajiaomiao Primary School in Zhangdian Township also often use their spare time to help the commune with production.

### 改进课堂教学　密切联系群众  红安县中小学教师普遍种试验田

    改进课堂教学　密切联系群众
    红安县中小学教师普遍种试验田
    新华社武汉25日电　湖北省红安县中小学教师广泛开展种试验田的活动，收到了良好的效果。
    红安县中小学教师种试验田是从冬季生产中开始的。据最近的统计，全县一千一百多名中小学教师，已种各种作物的试验田二百五十多亩。教师们利用课余时间，同社干部或社员一起种这些田，向群众学习生产知识。元河乡郑必高小学的教师种了两亩试验田，他们和社里生产队订了合同，每次生产活动由队里派出有经验的老农民具体帮助，因此，这些教师个个情绪饱满，试验田的耕作、播种以及培育，都做得不错，在群众中影响很好。
    教师们参加这一活动的时间虽然很短，但已经得到好处。联山乡张石河小学的教师们通过培养试验田，丰富了农业知识，使课堂教学有声有色，生动活泼，受到了学生普遍欢迎。由于教师们坚持边教书，边劳动，改变过去脱离群众的作风，也迅速地改善了学校和群众的关系。很多地方的群众自动帮助学校解决了活动场所和学生试验园地的困难。群众比以前更加关心学校了。檀树乡三圣庵小学办公费不够用，附近的两个农业社便决定每学期拨十元给学校做办公费。大斛乡朝门口小学校舍倒塌，附近的农业社马上拿出一百三十元，并由社员帮助整修，不到一个星期就整修好了。峰岗乡下李安、陈通府等学校，过去学杂费老收不起来，现在社里自动代收，减少了学校很多麻烦。还有很多农业社自动帮助学校制桌椅和添置教学体育设备等等。
    教师种试验田的活动，对于启发学生热爱劳动也有很大作用。张店乡八角庙小学学生在教师培育试验田的带动下，也经常利用课余时间帮助社里生产。
