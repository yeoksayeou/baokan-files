"Long Vines Bearing Melons" Climb All Over the Mountains
By a commentator of this newspaper

    Like the plains, the farmland water conservancy construction movement in the mountainous areas of our country is also advancing by leaps and bounds. Mountain farmers, who were once helpless in the face of mountain floods and droughts, have shown amazing courage and creativity in controlling water since agricultural cooperation. They not only dared to think boldly and work vigorously, but also thought ingeniously and worked skillfully. No matter how difficult and dangerous, they could not be stopped. "Water is like a dragon, flowing downwards," which was once regarded as irresistible; but now mountain farmers are changing the direction of the water flow. For example, they are carving peaks and cutting ridges to draw water up the mountains, building bridges across valleys to guide water through the air. It can be said that they are ingenious and imaginative. All these arduous and wonderful projects are created by "local engineers" and "local methods" using simple tools and simple materials. The history of farmers' fate being at the mercy of nature for thousands of years is coming to an end, and a new era is beginning where farmers control and drive water according to their own will. Many mountain farmers are now doing one thing: cherishing and accumulating the water stored in the mountains, the water dug from the ground, and the water diverted from the foot of the mountains, so that the water can serve production obediently.

    How can the water controlled by various water conservancy projects most effectively serve mountain production? In this regard, many regions have created a best method, which is to build water conservancy irrigation networks, that is, to combine reservoirs, ponds, wells, valley weirs, ditches and other projects on the mountains, under the mountains, in front of the slopes, and behind the slopes into a complete irrigation system.

    Water conservancy networks are not uncommon in the plains, because building a water conservancy irrigation network in the plains only requires building some channels on the flat ground to draw water from rivers, lakes, and swamps (sometimes adding water drawn from wells) to irrigate the fields. However, in the mountains, things are not so simple. Because the mountains have both cliffs and valleys, basins, and slopes everywhere. To build a water conservancy irrigation network in such a complex terrain according to people's will and reasonable layout, how much effort will people have to spend! However, farmers have actually done such a difficult thing, and cleverly arranged water conservancy irrigation networks are appearing more and more in mountainous areas.

    Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, one of the advanced areas in farmland water conservancy construction, has many such mountain water conservancy networks. For example, Zhao Gang Township in Guanghua County has built one. This township is sandwiched between two loess ridges, and there is a small river in the mountains with a normal water depth of only half a foot. All the cultivated land in the township is on the hillside. Now, the farmers have built 25 river dams on this small river. Near each river dam, a long channel winding around the mountain and crossing the ridge has been opened, and each long channel is connected to many ponds, weirs and small reservoirs. This can raise the water level so that the river water flows along the channels winding around the mountain. The water in the channels irrigates the ponds, and the water in the ponds and weirs irrigates the fields. The local people call this water conservancy system "watermelon vine style". Relying on this "watermelon vine" style water conservancy network, the area of paddy fields in this township has expanded to nearly 2,000 mu in two years, and will expand to more than 10,000 mu this year.

    This "watermelon vine style" water conservancy network has now become a model for the vast number of mountain farmers in Hubei Province to learn from. Hong'an County, located at the foot of the Dabie Mountains, used to build some water conservancy projects, but the projects were not connected to each other, and water was not stored all year round, so that when drought occurred, the ponds and weirs dried up and could not meet the needs of farmland irrigation. In mid-November 1957, after visiting the "watermelon vine" style water conservancy networks in Guanghua and Jun Counties, Xiangyang Prefecture, the county decided to build more than 6,000 ponds and weirs in the winter of 1957 and the winter of 1958, use the valleys to build 99 reservoirs, build 330 river dams on large and small rivers, and dig 518 channels to build a water conservancy irrigation system of "mountains connected to water, water connected to mountains, rivers connected to weirs, weirs connected to ponds, and water everywhere to irrigate the fields". After the plan is completed, more than 85% of the paddy fields in the county can eliminate drought, and most of the "sky-watching hills" (fields that rely on the sky for harvest) can be irrigated.

    Gangnan Agricultural Cooperative in Langxi County, Anhui Province, located in the hilly area, joined the struggle to open ditches to divert water and store water to prevent drought in the spring of 1956 when it was just established. This cooperative originally had only one large dead pond. The members spent less than two months opening up 49 main ditches with a total length of 108 li from the upper reaches of the river to the lower reaches, from the main canal to the branch canal, and from the branch canal to the small canal. In this way, the original dead pond became a living pond, and lifting water for irrigation became gravity irrigation. In the second year, they continued to build water conservancy projects. By the spring of last year, the irrigated area of the whole cooperative had increased from more than 5,000 mu before the advanced cooperative to more than 13,800 mu. More than 90% of the fields in the cooperative can guarantee that they are not afraid of drought even if it does not rain for 50 days. This irrigation network has brought Gangnan Cooperative consecutive years of bumper harvests.

    This water conservancy irrigation system that echoes each other and connects with each other has also appeared in Hunan Province, but it uses another name, called "long vine bearing melons" style water conservancy project. With the help of water conservancy cadres, the Muyu Cave and Shuangqiao agricultural cooperatives in Chenxi County have built a series of water conservancy projects in the past two years, including small reservoirs, mountain ponds, siphon pipes, water flumes, stream dams, channels, etc. These channels communicate with each other, like long vines, connecting various scattered reservoirs and mountain ponds, like melons growing on vines. In the past two years, the production appearance of the two cooperatives has changed significantly. In 1955, the average yield per mu of the two cooperatives was 319 jin, and in 1957 it increased to 549 jin. The masses said that the "long vine bearing melons" style water conservancy irrigation system has "turned the land over".

    Xin Chang Township in Dading County, Guizhou Province, also has such a water conservancy network, which the local people call "pond group ditch network".

    With such good examples and good experiences, mountain water conservancy construction has a direction. The advantage of the "long vine bearing melons" style water conservancy network lies in the fact that the various water conservancy projects in this "network" are not built and used in isolation, but are built according to a relatively detailed design, so that various interconnected projects cooperate with each other and help each other. In this way, water can be used most economically and the irrigated area can be expanded to the maximum extent. For example, a reservoir is built in a mountain ditch, and its water storage can irrigate 500 mu of land. However, the farmland near the reservoir that can be irrigated may only be 300 mu. If the reservoir is not connected to other projects around it, then the water that can irrigate 200 mu of land will be wasted. If a way is found to connect the reservoir with a pond on another hillside, a part of the water from the reservoir can be transported to other ponds, stored, so as to enhance the drought resistance of the farmland near the ponds. This is the advantage of this "long vine bearing melons" style water conservancy network. Therefore, various mountain agricultural cooperatives should not only be satisfied with how many water conservancy projects have been built in water conservancy construction, but also consider whether the layout of these projects is reasonable; do not regard various projects in isolation, but regard them as various components of a whole; do not only be satisfied with obtaining a little water, but should consider how to use the water already obtained most economically and how to maximize the drought resistance of the projects. Here, the importance of overall planning is revealed. Because in the planning, attention is paid to maximizing the benefits of various projects. Building a water conservancy network under the guidance of such a plan can avoid waste and reduce project costs.

    Now aren't many mountain agricultural cooperatives striving for the goal of "mountain water conservancy"? The completion of a complete "long vine bearing melons" style water conservancy network with full drought resistance marks the realization of mountain water conservancy. Of course, the "long vine bearing melons" style irrigation network cannot necessarily be completed in one or two years. Agricultural cooperatives in various places may wish to revise the original relatively rough water conservancy plan so as to achieve this goal in stages over several years. The construction of the "long vine bearing melons" style water conservancy network can generally be carried out by agricultural cooperatives as a unit, and can also be carried out jointly by various cooperatives under certain conditions.

    The "long vine bearing melons" style water conservancy network is a new creation of some mountain farmers, and its advantages have not been understood by the majority of people in the vast mountainous areas. If the leading organs in various places can seriously summarize the typical experience in this regard and promote it by organizing visits and so on, then, in the near future, there will be scenes of "long vines bearing melons climbing all over the mountains", and mountain production and construction can achieve fruitful results.

    “长藤结瓜”满山爬
    本报评论员
    和平原地区一样，我国各地山区的农田水利建设运动也正在突飞猛进。从前被山洪和旱灾逼得束手无策的山区农民，农业合作化以后，在制服水上面表现了惊人的勇气和创造力。他们不但大胆地想，勇猛地干，而且想得妙，干得巧，任何艰难险阻都挡不住他们的进路。“水像一条龙，从上往下行”，从前被看做是不可抗拒的；可是现在山区农民却在改变水流的方向。比如凿峰削岭，引水上山，跨谷架桥，导水行空，真可谓别出心裁，异想天开。而所有这些艰巨、奇妙的工程，又都是依靠“土工程师”和“土办法”、利用笨工具和笨材料造成的。千百年来农民的命运任凭自然摆布的历史正在结束，农民按照自己的意志控制水、驱使水的新时期开始了。许多山区农民现在正在做的一件事，就是要把在山上蓄住的水，从地下挖出的水，以及从山下引上来的水，通通都当做宝贝珍惜地蓄积起来，使水服服贴贴地为生产服务。
    究竟怎样才能使各种水利工程所控制的水最有效地为山区生产服务呢？在这方面，不少地区已经创造出了一个最好的办法，这就是建设水利灌溉网，也就是把山上山下、坡前坡后的水库、池塘、水井、谷坊、沟渠等等工程组成一个完整的灌溉系统。
    水利网出现在平原本不算稀奇，因为在平原地区建设一个水利灌溉网，只要在平地上修筑一些渠道，把河川、湖泊、沼泽里的水（有时再加上从井里汲取的水）引来灌田就成。然而在山区，事情可就不那么简单了。因为山区既有悬崖峭壁，也有沟谷盆地，还有遍地都是的缓坂陡坡。要在地形这样复杂的地方，按照人们的意志，按照合理的布局，建设一个水利灌溉网，需要人们熬费多少心机呵！但是，这样困难的事情，农民竟然干成了，经过巧妙布置的水利灌溉网在山区越来越多地出现了。
    兴修农田水利的先进地区之一的湖北省襄阳专区就有不少这样的山区水利网，比如光化县赵岗乡就建成了一个。这个乡被夹在两条黄土岭当中，山里有条平时水深不过半尺的小河，全乡的耕地全部在山坡上。现在，农民在这条小河上修筑了二十五道拦河坝，每条河坝附近开辟了一条盘山过岭的长渠，每条长渠又连结了许多塘、堰和小水库。这样就能抬高水位使河水沿渠道盘山流动，渠里的水灌塘，塘、堰里的水浇田。当地群众给这种水利系统取名叫“西瓜秧式”。就是依靠这种“西瓜秧”式的水利网，这个乡的水田面积在两年内扩大到近两千亩，今年将要扩大到一万多亩。
    这种“西瓜秧式”的水利网目前已经成为湖北省广大山区农民学习的榜样。位于大别山麓的红安县过去修了一些水利工程，但是各个工程之间互不联系，没有做到常年蓄水，以致遇到干旱，就塘干堰枯，不能满足农田灌溉的需要。1957年11月中旬，这个县参观了襄阳专区光化、均县的“西瓜秧”式的水利网以后，决定在1957年冬和1958年冬修六千多处塘堰，利用山谷修九十九座水库，在大小河流上修三百三十道拦河坝，挖渠道五百一十八条，建成一个“山连水，水连山，河通堰，堰通塘，到处有水灌田”的水利灌溉系统。计划完成以后，全县85％以上的水田可以消灭旱灾，大部分“望天丘”（靠天收成的田）可以得到灌溉。
    位于丘陵地区的安徽省郎溪县岗南农业合作社在1956年春刚刚建社，就投入了开沟引水、蓄水防旱的斗争。这个社原来只有一处大死塘，社员们用不到两个月的时间，从河流上游到下游，从干渠到支渠，从支渠到小渠，开凿了四十九条全长一百零八里的主要沟渠。这样，原来的死水塘就变成了活水塘，提水灌溉变成了自流灌溉。第二年又继续兴修水利，到去年春季，全社灌溉面积由高级合作化前的五千多亩增加到一万三千八百多亩。全社已有90％以上的田能保证五十天不下雨也不怕旱。这个灌溉网已经给岗南社带来了连续两年的大丰收。
    这种互相呼应、彼此串连的水利灌溉系统，在湖南省也出现了，只不过用的是另外一个名字，叫做“长藤结瓜”式水利工程。辰溪县的?木洞、双桥两个农业社在水利干部的帮助下，在过去两年当中，修筑了一系列的水利工程，包括小水库、山塘、虹吸管、水槽、溪坝、渠道等，这些渠道彼此沟通，有如条条长藤，把各种星罗棋布的水库、山塘联系起来，好像藤上结瓜。两年来这两个社的生产面貌显著改变了。1955年两社每亩平均产量是三百一十九斤，1957年提高到五百四十九斤。群众说，“长藤结瓜”式的水利灌溉系统使得“土地翻了身”。
    贵州省大定县新场乡也有这样的水利网，当地群众叫做“塘群沟网”。
    有了这样一些好榜样，好经验，山区水利建设就有了方向。“长藤结瓜”式的水利网的优点就在于这个“网”里的各种水利工程，不是孤立地建设，孤立地使用，而是按照一个比较细致的设计去建设，使得各种互相沟通的工程互相配合，彼此接济。这样，就可以最经济地使用水，最大限度地扩大灌溉面积。譬如，在一条山沟里修了一座水库，它的蓄水可以灌溉五百亩田，可是，水库附近可能受灌的农田只有三百亩。如果水库跟周围其他的工程没有连系，那么就有可灌田二百亩的水被浪费掉。如果设法把这座水库跟另一个山坡的池塘连系起来，就可以把水库的一部分水输送给别的池塘，蓄起来，以便增强池塘附近农田的抗旱能力。这就是这种“长藤结瓜”式水利网的好处。所以，各个山区农业合作社在水利建设当中，不要仅仅满足于水利工程修了多少，还应当考虑这些工程的布局是否合理；不要把各项工程孤立地看待，而把它们当作一个整体中的各个组成部分看待；不要仅仅满足于得到了一点水，而应当考虑如何最经济地利用已经得到的水，如何最大限度地发挥工程的抗旱能力。这里，就显出了全面规划的重要性。因为在规划当中就注意了最充分地发挥各项工程的效益，在这样的规划指导下去建设水利网，就可能避免浪费，降低工程成本。
    现在不是许多山区农业社都在为“山区水利化”的目标而努力吗？一个完整的、具有充分抗旱能力的“长藤结瓜”式水利网的建成，就标志着山区水利化的实现。当然，“长藤结瓜”式的灌溉网并不一定在一两年内就能全部完成，各地农业合作社不妨把原先的比较粗略的水利规划重新加以修订，以便在若干年内分期实现这个目标。“长藤结瓜”式水利网的建设，一般地可以以农业社为单位来进行，在一定条件下也可以由各个社联合进行。
    “长藤结瓜”式水利网是部分山区农民的一项新创造，它的好处还没有为广大山区的多数群众所了解。如果各地领导机关能把这方面的典型经验加以认真的总结，并用组织参观、访问等方式加以推广，那末，在不久的将来，就会到处是“长藤结瓜满山爬”的景象，山区生产建设就能得到丰硕的果实。
