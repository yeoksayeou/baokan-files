Xinhua News Agency, 11th — Throughout the country, vast numbers of young people of eligible age are enthusiastically enlisting for military service, fulfilling the glorious duty of defending the motherland.

Since the start of conscription work, military service organs in many provinces, cities, and counties across the country have been receiving a large number of enlistment applications and letters of determination from factories, rural areas, and schools every day. Wei Zhaoqing, a youth from Aohan Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, applied to the military service bureau for enlistment eight times to become a national defense soldier. Wang Daolu, a youth from the Jin County Asbestos Mine in Liaoning Province, wrote more than 30 letters to the military service bureau over the years requesting to serve in the military. In his application this year, he guaranteed that he would abide by discipline and obey orders after joining the army. One hundred percent of the eligible young people at the Qingdao Printing and Dyeing Factory have signed up for enlistment. Li Shoujia and four other eligible young people from Xinjixiang Township in Gansu Province carried their collective letter of determination, beating gongs and drums to apply for enlistment.

Many parents, wives, and brothers are also vying to send their relatives to serve in the military. In Yidu County, Hubei Province, there have been more than 200 touching cases of parents enlisting for their sons, wives for their husbands, and fathers-in-law for their sons-in-law. Luo Mama from Luofan Township already has her eldest son in the military, and this time she sent her second son to enlist. Zhang Dongxing, a man in his fifties from Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, said when he reported to the county military service bureau on behalf of his son, Zhang Xiaosheng: “Rightists dream of restoring capitalism. I want my son to serve in the military, resolutely defend socialism, and defend the Communist Party.”

While enthusiastically signing up for enlistment, young people in various places are also actively participating in the winter production campaign. Sixty-nine enlistees from Baisang Township in Yangcheng County proposed to dig sixty-nine dry wells, accumulate three thousand dan of fertilizer, and apply topdressing fertilizer to one hundred and thirty-eight mu of wheat before joining the army. They will also actively participate in activities such as opening canals and digging wells as a souvenir and gift for enlisting. One thousand five hundred enlistees from five townships, including Zhangshi in Rongcheng County, Hebei Province, organized commando teams and threw themselves into water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation campaigns. Thirty-two eligible young people from Xinjiang County in Shanxi Province spent seven days opening a canal, which they named the "Enlistment Canal."

    各地出现父代子、妻代夫报名应征的动人事例
    新华社11日讯　全国各地广大适龄青年踊跃应征服兵役，履行保卫祖国的光荣义务。
    征兵工作开始以来，全国许多省、市、县的兵役机关，每天都要收到大量来自工厂、农村和学校的应征申请书和决心书。内蒙古自治区敖汉旗青年魏兆庆，为了争取当一名国防战士，曾一连八次向兵役局申请入伍。辽宁省金县石棉矿青年王道禄几年来写了三十多封信给兵役局，要求服兵役，并且在今年的申请书上提出了入伍以后遵守纪律、服从命令的保证。青岛印染厂的适龄青年百分之百都报名应征。甘肃省新集乡适龄青年李守甲等五人抬着大家写成的决心书，敲锣打鼓申请入伍。
    许多父母、妻子、兄弟也争相欢送自己的亲人去服兵役。湖北省宜都县出现了二百多起父母代子、妻代夫、岳丈代女婿报名应征的动人事例。罗畈乡罗妈妈的大儿子还没有退伍，这次她又把二儿子送去应征。山西省阳城县五十多岁的张东兴，替他的儿子张小胜到县兵役局报到时说：“右派分子梦想叫资本主义复辟，我要我儿子服兵役，坚决保卫社会主义，保卫共产党。”
    各地青年一面踊跃报名应征，一面还在积极参加冬季大生产运动。阳城县白桑乡六十九名应征青年提出，入伍以前要打旱井六十九口，积肥三千担，小麦加工施追肥一百三十八亩，并要积极参加开渠、打井等活动，作为应征入伍的留念和献礼。河北省容城县张市等五个乡的一千五百名应征青年分别组织突击队，投入了水利、积肥运动。山西省新绛县的三十二名适龄青年用七天时间，开了一条水渠，命名为“应征渠”。
