    Masterpiece "The Rout" Brought to the Screen
    A vast forest stretching for hundreds of miles slumbers quietly. A team of Red guerrillas, pursued by the enemy, are retreating. An explosion rings out, and a young man in uniform falls. He struggles to get up, but is exhausted, only managing to stretch out his hands and shout something unintelligible. Suddenly, a horseman emerges from the jungle, swiftly hoists the wounded youth onto his saddle, and speeds away into the woods...
    This is the scene of Mettka being rescued by Moroška, a scene from the film adaptation of Fadeyev's masterpiece, "The Rout." This novel was introduced to China long ago by Lu Xun's translation and is well-known to Chinese readers. The novel is currently being filmed by the Soviet Film Academy, with the assistance of the Gorky Film Studio. The people working on and performing in the film are all university students, graduates, and graduating students of the Film Academy. The screenplay adaptation was written by three graduating students. The picture below shows the female lead in the film, Valeria, played by a graduate of the Film Academy.

    名著“毁灭”搬上银幕
    一片连绵有几百里的大森林，静悄悄地打着瞌睡。一队红色游击队员，被敌人追赶着正在撤退。爆炸声响，一个穿着制服的青年倒下了。他挣扎着想爬起来，可是已精疲力尽，只是两手一伸，喊叫声听不清的什么话。突然，丛林中跑出了一个骑马的人，他迅速地把受伤的青年载在鞍上，向丛林飞驰而去……。
    这是木罗式加援救美谛克的情景，是根据法捷耶夫的名著“毁灭”所拍电影的一个镜头。“毁灭”这部小说很早就由鲁迅翻译介绍到我国，是我国读者所熟知的一部作品。这部小说现在正由苏联电影学院在高尔基电影制片厂的协助下摄制成电影。参加工作和演出的都是电影学院的大学生、毕业生和应届毕业生。把这部小说改编成电影剧本的就是三位应届毕业生。下图是电影中的女主角华理亚，由电影学院毕业生扮演。
