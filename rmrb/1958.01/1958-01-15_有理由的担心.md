    Justified Worries
    Two British evening newspapers reported the news that an American plane carrying nuclear weapons had crashed in the United States. This news caused panic among many people in Britain. They worry that if a similar accident were to occur in Britain, a large part of this densely populated island would be wiped out.
    An American plane crashed in the United States, yet it made the British people across the ocean tremble with fear. This may seem a bit strange, but it is not strange at all. Because American planes carrying nuclear bombs are circling over Britain every day, and no one can guarantee that these planes will not crash on this densely populated island.
    Even if someone could guarantee it, the danger that American planes carrying hydrogen bombs pose to the British people is obviously not just a matter of whether they will crash or not.

    有理由的担心
    英国两家晚报报道了一架载有核武器的美国飞机在美国坠毁的消息，这个消息引起英国许多人的惊慌。他们担心，如果在英国也发生一次类似的事故，这个人口稠密的海岛就会有一大部分化为乌有。
    美国飞机在美国坠毁，却使大洋彼岸的英国人心惊胆战。这说来有点奇怪，但也毫不奇怪。因为载着核弹的美国飞机天天在英国上空盘旋，没有人能保证这些飞机不会在这个人口稠密的海岛上坠毁。
    就是有人能保证又怎么样呢，美国带氢弹的飞机给英国人民所造成的危险显然还不仅是会不会坠毁的问题。
