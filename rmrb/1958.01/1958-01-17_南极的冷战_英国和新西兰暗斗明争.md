"The Cold War in Antarctica"
Britain and New Zealand's Covert and Overt Strife

    Britain's long-publicized plan to cross the Antarctic continent is proceeding slowly. Disputes have arisen within the expedition team. A newspaper in Wellington, Britain, has termed this dispute between the New Zealand team and the British main team in the plan as "The Cold War in Antarctica." According to the plan, the British main team, led by Fuchs, should depart from the British scientific base Shackleton, pass through the South Pole, and arrive at the American scientific base Scott. En route, the New Zealand expedition team, led by Hillary, should advance seven hundred miles from Scott to meet them and guide the main team to Scott.

    Both expeditions set off one after the other in early winter last year. Unexpectedly, the New Zealand expedition team was the first to reach the meeting point; while the British expedition team advanced very slowly. At this moment, the expedition team led by Hillary suddenly changed its plan and advanced towards the South Pole on its own, and on January 3rd of this year, completed the five hundred-mile journey, taking the lead in reaching the South Pole, turning the matter into a race to be the first to reach the South Pole again in more than forty years. The bourgeois press has been widely publicizing Hillary's victory in the South Pole race.

    The day after Hillary reached the South Pole, he returned to Scott Base by American plane and suggested that the British expedition team stop advancing after reaching the South Pole, leaving the remaining one thousand two hundred miles to be completed at the end of this year. The reason given was that the Antarctic climate would soon deteriorate, and winter would descend upon the Antarctic continent in February. Fuchs should not risk the lives of his expedition team members. According to Hillary's estimation, it would take Fuchs at least forty more days to complete his task of crossing Antarctica. Hillary also declared that he was unwilling to have his team members spend a second winter in Antarctica waiting for Fuchs and decided to withdraw them from Antarctica soon.

    Bowden, the leader of the New Zealand Antarctic Exploration Committee, is said to have committed a "heinous error" due to negligence by making this suggestion public.

    Thus, a covert struggle turned into an overt dispute. Fuchs first rejected this suggestion "both sadly and angrily." He also declared that he would not care if Hillary and his team did not come to meet them, and that "they would find their own way forward regardless."

    New Zealand's Prime Minister Nash also supported Hillary, saying that his judgment was correct, "he has never done anything wrong." At the same time, Nash also denied that he had ever put pressure on Hillary to go to the South Pole against the plan. New Zealand's former Minister of Finance Watts also said that there was no harm in Hillary going to the South Pole. He was also proud of Hillary's success.

    As of the 15th, Fuchs, with his team members and five damaged snow vehicles, was still fighting against the ice and snow one hundred and five miles away from the South Pole, advancing towards the South Pole in an unsupported situation at a speed of approximately thirty miles per day. Because their snow vehicles had been greatly damaged on the way, they had to stop and repair them for a day every two hundred miles.

    Now, the American expedition personnel at the end point of the Antarctic crossing plan are also saying from the sidelines that if Fuchs wants to continue advancing, he cannot avoid encountering danger. In 1912, the famous explorer Scott died on this route. Fuchs is also unlikely to surpass him. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

### “南极的冷战”  英国和新西兰暗斗明争

    “南极的冷战”
    英国和新西兰暗斗明争
    英国宣传已久的横渡南极大陆计划执行缓慢，考察队内部发生了纠纷，英国威灵敦一家报纸把这个计划中的新西兰队和英国主队之间的这种纠纷称为“南极的冷战”。根据计划，应该由英国的福克斯带领英国主队从英国科学基地沙克尔顿出发，经过南极点，到美国科学基地斯科特。途中，由希拉里带领新西兰考察队从斯科特前行七百英里去迎接，把主队带到斯科特。
    去年初冬，这两个考察队都先后出发了。不想新西兰考察队首先到达了迎接地点；而英国考察队却前进得很慢。就在这个时候，希拉里领导的考察队突然改变计划，自己向南极点前进，并且在今年1月3日，走完了五百英里的路程，抢先到达了南极点，把事情变成了争取四十多年来人们第一次重新到达南极点的竞赛。资产阶级报刊纷纷宣扬，希拉里在南极点的竞赛中获胜了。
    当希拉里到达南极点后的第二天，他就乘美国飞机回到斯科特基地，并且提出建议，要求英国考察队在到达南极点后即停止前进，把其余一千二百英里的路程留待今年年底再去完成。理由是，南极的气候很快就要变坏，一到2月，冬季就要降临南极大陆，福克斯不应把他的考察队人员的生命来冒险。据希拉里估计，福克斯完成他横渡南极的任务至少还要四十多天。希拉里还扬言，他不愿意让他领导的人员因为等待福克斯而在南极过第二个冬天，决定很快把他们撤出南极。
    新西兰的南极考察委员会领导人鲍登，据说是因为疏忽，犯了“可恶的错误”，把这份建议公开发表了。
    于是，一场暗斗便变成了一场明争。福克斯首先“既伤心，又愤怒地”拒绝了这个建议。并且宣称，如果希拉里他们不来迎接也不在乎，不管怎么样，“他们会自己找道路前进的。”
    新西兰的总理纳希也支持希拉里，说他的判断是正确的，“他从来就没有做过不正确的事情。”同时，纳希还否认人家说他曾经对希拉里施加压力，要他不根据计划前往南极点。新西兰的前财政部长瓦茨也说，希拉里到南极点，并没有什么害处。他并且以希拉里获得的成功而自豪。
    到15日为止，福克斯正带着他的人员和五辆破损的雪车，还在远离南极点一百零五英里的地方，和冰雪搏斗，以每天约三十英里的速度，在前后无援的状况下向南极点前进。由于他们的雪车已经在路上受到了很大的损伤，因此，每前进两百英里，就要停下来检修一天。
    现在在横渡南极计划终点上的美国考察人员也在一旁说，如果福克斯要继续前进，不可能不遭到危险。1912年，著名探险家斯科特就是在这条路上死的。福克斯也不可能超过他。　（新华社）（附图片）
