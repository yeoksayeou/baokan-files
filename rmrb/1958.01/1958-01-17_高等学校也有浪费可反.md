Institutions of higher education are currently experiencing a high tide of airing views against waste in the vast majority of cases. This is an important struggle to implement the policy of building the country and running schools with diligence and thrift. The significance of this struggle is to eliminate the bad habit of extravagance and waste, to use human, material, and financial resources rationally and economically, and to strive to do more with less cost, so as to promote the vigorous development of China's higher education and socialist cause. Every institution of higher education should take this struggle as one of the important tasks of rectification.

Some people say that institutions of higher education are educational undertakings, not factories or mines that create material wealth, so waste is limited. This statement is wrong. Countless facts have proved that waste in institutions of higher education is not limited, but widespread and serious. Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, thanks to the attention and concern of the Party and the government for the development of higher education, the state has invested a large amount of human, material, and financial resources. The number of teachers in institutions of higher education has increased from 16,000 in the early days of the People’s Republic to the current 70,000; the area of school buildings has increased from more than 3 million square meters in the early days of the People’s Republic to the current 11 million square meters; and tens of thousands of valuable instruments and equipment have been added, with a value of more than 350 million yuan. Since the founding of the People's Republic, the investment in higher education has been nearly 3 billion yuan, and the annual expenditure on higher education now exceeds 16 times the average annual expenditure during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. In the use of human, material, and financial resources, many are used rationally and appropriately, but there are also many that are used improperly and with serious extravagance and waste. Just by calculating a few accounts, you can see the seriousness of the waste problem. Since the founding of the People's Republic, the investment in basic construction of higher education has totaled more than 900 million yuan. As long as we can find ways to correct the excessively high design standards, excessive area, and poor management during the construction process, it is preliminarily estimated that at least 10% of the investment can be saved, which means that more than 90 million yuan can be saved. According to the preliminary inspection of 57 laboratories by Tsinghua University during the rectification movement, the backlog and waste caused by wrong purchases, repeated purchases, and random purchases of teaching equipment accounted for about 10% of the teaching equipment costs that have already been spent. The use of people's scholarships in institutions of higher education, according to recent inspections, has reached 80%, which is also a bit too broad; the average standard of 15 yuan per person per month is also a bit high; as long as the scope and standard are reasonably lowered, several million yuan can be saved a year. In terms of staffing, the phenomena of large institutions, multiple levels, uneven distribution of work, and overstaffing are also relatively common. From these aspects alone, it is fully illustrated that institutions of higher education can still achieve great rational savings.

A lot of waste in institutions of higher education is caused by our lack of experience, which is still unavoidable at present. However, this is only one side of the reason. On the other hand, judging from the problems discovered in the inspections of various schools and departments, the most important reason is that the leaders of some institutions of higher education have not earnestly implemented the policy of running schools with diligence and thrift, the work style of hard struggle, diligence, and frugality is still very poor, and there are even serious bourgeois work styles. Many institutions of higher education spend a lot of money and waste a lot, but they do not necessarily do things well. For example, some newly built or relocated schools have not implemented the state's land quota and land requisition regulations, using too much land and having very sparse building density, which is actually inconvenient for teachers and students to go to and from classes. Some schools blindly pursue quantity, size, and novelty, and various administrative rooms are generally too many and the equipment level is very high, but the utilization rate is very low, which affects the construction of what should be built. Some schools, in the use of instruments and books, emphasize exclusive use between laboratories and departments, not sharing resources. As a result, on the one hand, there are phenomena of duplication, surplus, backlog, and waste, and on the other hand, due to improper use of funds and improper arrangements, what should be bought and can be bought is not bought, failing to meet the needs. These are obviously ideological problems rather than experience problems. It is particularly worth noting that, under the influence of this extravagant and wasteful atmosphere, some institutions of higher education naturally lack the training and education of hard struggle for students, and a small number of students have begun to develop an unhealthy idea, being reluctant to leave the city, go to the countryside, go to factories, or go to border areas to work hard for the construction of border areas. Some teaching staff have also developed the idea of being frivolous, lazy, and impractical, and the idea of being irresponsible and relying on others to solve difficulties. If these bad ideas become a trend in institutions of higher education, then the students cultivated by institutions of higher education will not be the hard-working, brave, and good cadres who are good at overcoming difficulties with their own hands that socialist construction needs.

In carrying out the anti-waste struggle in institutions of higher education, we should first oppose the bourgeois ideas of the leaders of institutions of higher education who seek novelty and size, do not proceed from China's current economic level, and unrealistically pursue modernization and pay attention to pomp and style. In order to cultivate a large number of high-level construction talents who master the world's advanced science and technology, and in order to ensure the minimum needs of school teaching and scientific research, it is still necessary to build some better classrooms and laboratories and purchase a batch of the latest instruments and equipment. However, daily courses and experiments should make full use of existing buildings and equipment, and existing equipment can also be used to meet the requirements. Modernized classrooms and laboratories are not all necessary, and many experiments do not need the latest instruments and equipment to be carried out. As for buildings that are not directly used for teaching, such as auditoriums, gymnasiums, and administrative rooms, they should be as simple as possible and not extravagant. In the future, in the basic construction of school buildings, we should strive to be frugal; in the purchase of instruments, in addition to instruments and equipment belonging to the world's latest science and technology (such as peaceful use of atomic energy, aviation engineering, radio engineering, electronic computers, etc.), generally we should make as much use of old equipment as possible, purchase domestically made instruments, or encourage schools to modify or make their own instruments.

In the anti-waste struggle in institutions of higher education, we must also change some unreasonable systems and correct some unreasonable tendencies. Now, in the life management of teachers, students, and staff in schools, there is an idea of relying on the public to take care of everything. Under the control of this idea, the school is responsible for providing all life and welfare facilities with low-cost dormitories, furniture, canteens, bathhouses, nurseries, barbershops, etc., and even a part of the rent and utility bills of private dormitories are subsidized by the public. As a result, teachers, students, and staff ignore finding ways to overcome difficulties themselves, ignore frugality, promote reliance, and at the same time, add many unnecessary administrative institutions and administrative staff to the school. In order to change this situation, educational administrative departments and institutions of higher education should formulate a set of rules and management methods to overcome waste and implement the policy of running schools with diligence and thrift, based on the various extravagance and waste phenomena exposed in this rectification and the various rationalization proposals put forward by the masses, distinguishing between the importance and urgency.

In order to eliminate the phenomenon of waste in institutions of higher education and adhere to the policy of running schools with diligence and thrift, it is also necessary to strengthen political and ideological education among teachers, students, and staff, and promote the spirit of hard struggle. During the Anti-Japanese War, schools in the base areas took hard work and simplicity as their school spirit. In the past, some college students worked and studied part-time, and some teachers, in extremely simple conditions, came up with many ways to overcome difficulties and carried out effective teaching and scientific research work. These excellent traditions and work styles should be studied, inherited, and used to run socialist institutions of higher education well. It must be recognized that the important significance of opposing extravagance and waste in institutions of higher education is, on the one hand, to save state funds and accelerate the speed of socialist construction, and on the other hand, to use the spirit of hard work and thrift of the working people to cultivate new construction talents for the country. One of the characteristics of the working-class intellectuals who serve socialist construction is that they must not only learn and master modern advanced science and technology, but also understand and implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift. Educational administrative departments, party committees, and administrative departments of various schools should attach importance to this work, conduct systematic ideological education for all educational administrative personnel and school teachers, students, and staff, and ideologically improve everyone's understanding of the policy of running schools with diligence and thrift; at the same time, they should also take some organizational measures to eliminate future extravagance and waste. This is an important and inseparable link that must be grasped in implementing the policy of running schools with diligence and thrift.

Although institutions of higher education have carried out anti-waste movements in the past, they do not have much experience; young students have high socialist enthusiasm, but they are prone to grasping one aspect and ignoring another. Therefore, when opposing extravagance and waste, educational administrative departments must pay attention to strengthening leadership. It is necessary to affirm that in order to cultivate talents who master modern science and technology, there must be certain material conditions; in the past few years, it has been completely necessary to appropriately improve the living conditions of students in order to improve students' physical health. The problem is that some places have done too much, causing waste. This phenomenon must be overcome; but we should distinguish right from wrong in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and conduct a detailed analysis of the various systems and measures of the past. What should be affirmed should be affirmed, what should be improved should be improved, and what should be cancelled should be cancelled. We must prevent excessive phenomena that have already occurred in some schools, such as excessive reduction of food costs, teachers returning a large number of dormitory rooms, and so on. This kind of unanalyzed approach will also have adverse consequences for running our educational undertakings that cultivate talents for socialist construction.

    高等学校也有浪费可反
  　在绝大多数的高等学校中，目前正在掀起一个反浪费的鸣放高潮。这是贯彻勤俭建国勤俭办学方针的一场重要斗争。这场斗争的意义，是要扫除铺张浪费的坏风气，合理地、节约地使用人力物力财力，争取用更少的代价办更多的事，以促进我国高等教育和社会主义事业的蓬勃发展。每所高等学校，都应该把这场斗争作为整改工作的重要课题之一。
    有人说，高等学校是教育事业，不是创造物质财富的工厂矿山，因此浪费有限。这种说法是错误的。无数事实证明，高等学校的浪费不是有限的，而是普遍和严重的。建国以来，由于党和政府对于发展高等教育事业的重视和关怀，国家已经投入了大批的人力物力和财力。高等学校教师由建国初期的一万六千人增加到现在的七万人；校舍面积由建国初期的三百多万平方公尺增加到现在的一千一百多万平方公尺；贵重的仪器设备增加了数万件，价值在三亿五千万元以上。建国以来的高等教育投资约近三十亿元，现在一年的高等教育经费要超过国民党反动统治时期平均一年经费的十六倍以上。在使用人力物力和财力方面，很多是用的合理恰当的，但也有不少是用之不当并有严重铺张浪费的。只要算几笔账，就可以看到浪费问题的严重性。建国以来高等教育的基本建设投资共计九亿多元，只要设法纠正设计标准过高、面积过大和修建过程中的管理不善，初步估计至少可以节省10％左右的投资，也就是说可以节约九千多万元。根据清华大学在整改运动中对五十七个试验室的初步检查，由于错买、重买、乱买教学设备而造成的积压浪费，约占已经花费的教学设备费的10％左右。高等学校人民助学金的使用，根据最近检查看来，享受面达到了80％，也是宽了一些；每人每月平均十五元的标准也高了一些；只要把享受面和标准合理地压低些，一年就可以节省几百万元。在人员编制方面，机构大、层次多、忙闲不均、人浮于事的现象也比较普遍。只从这几方面来看，就充分说明高等学校还是可以大大合理节约的。
    高等学校的浪费，有很多是由于我们的经验不足造成的，这在目前还是难免的。但是，这只是原因的一面，另一面，从各校各方面检查所发现的问题看起来，最主要的还在于若干高等学校的领导方面对勤俭办学的方针没有认真贯彻，艰苦奋斗、勤俭朴素的作风还很差，甚至还有严重的资产阶级作风。许多高等学校花钱很多，浪费很大，并不一定都把事情办好了。例如：有些新建或迁建的学校，没有执行国家的用地定额和征用土地的规定，用地过多，建筑密度很稀，对师生上下课反而有许多不便。有的学校盲目贪多贪大贪新，各种行政用房普遍偏多，设备水平很高，而利用率则很低，影响到该建的反而不能建。有的学校在使用仪器和图书方面，各实验室之间、各系之间强调专用，不通有无，结果一方面有重复多余和积压浪费现象，一方面由于资金使用不当，安排不当，又影响到应该买而且能够买到的没有买到，不能满足需要。这些，都显然是思想问题而不是经验问题。特别值得注意的是，若干高等学校在这种铺张浪费风气的影响下，对学生自然更缺乏艰苦奋斗的锻炼和教育，少数学生开始滋长着一种不健康的思想，留恋大城市的生活条件，不愿意下乡下厂，不愿意到边疆地区为边疆建设事业而艰苦奋斗。某些教学人员也滋长了浮华怠惰、不务实际的思想，滋长了不负责任、依赖别人解决困难的思想。如果这些不良思想在高等学校成为风气，那末，高等学校培养出来的学生将不可能是社会主义建设所需要的那种勤劳、勇敢、善于用自己的双手克服困难的好干部。
    在高等学校开展反浪费斗争，首先应该反对高等学校领导方面求新求大，不从我国当前经济水平出发，不切实际地追求现代化以及讲究排场和气派的资产阶级思想。为着培养大批的掌握世界先进科学技术的高级建设人才，为着保证学校教学和科学研究最低的需要，修建一些比较好的教室和实验室，采购一批最新的仪器设备还是必要的。但是，日常的课程和实验应该充分利用旧有房屋和设备，而且也可以利用旧有设备来满足要求，并不都需要近代化的教室和实验室，许多实验并不都需要有最新的仪器设备才能进行。至于礼堂、体育馆和行政用房等非直接用于教学的建筑，更应因陋就简，不事铺张。今后，在校舍等基本建设方面要力求节俭；在仪器的购买方面，除了一些属于世界上最新科学技术（如和平利用原子能、航空工程、无线电工程、电子计算机等）专业的仪器设备以外，一般的应尽可能地利用旧设备、购买国内自制的仪器或提倡学校改制或自制仪器。
    在高等学校反浪费斗争中，还要改变一些不合理的制度，纠正一些不合理的倾向。现在，在学校师生员工生活管理上有一种事事都要依赖公家包下来的思想。在这种思想支配下，学校负责提供取费低廉的宿舍、家具、食堂、澡堂、托儿所、理发室等一切生活福利设施，就连私人宿舍的房租水电费也要由公家补贴一部分。这样一来，师生员工就忽略了自己想办法克服困难，忽略了节俭，助长了依赖思想，同时，也使学校中增加了许多不必要的行政机构和行政工作人员。为了改变这种状况，教育行政部门和高等学校应该针对着这次整改中揭发出来的各种铺张浪费现象和群众提出的各种合理化建议，分别轻重缓急，逐步拟订一套克服浪费和贯彻勤俭办学方针的规章制度和管理办法。
    为了杜绝高等学校的浪费现象，坚持勤俭办学的方针，还要在师生员工中加强政治思想教育，提倡艰苦奋斗的精神。抗日战争时期，根据地的学校都以艰苦朴素作为自己的校风。过去有些大学生半工半读，勤工俭学，有些教师在设备极其简陋的情况下，自己想出了许多克服困难的办法进行了有成效的教学和科学研究工作。这些优良的传统和作风，应当加以研究，继承下来，办好社会主义的高等学校。必须认识到，在高等学校反对铺张浪费的重要意义，一方面是为了节约国家资金，加速社会主义建设的速度，一方面是为了用劳动人民勤劳俭朴的精神来培养国家新的建设人才。为社会主义建设服务的工人阶级知识分子的特色之一，就是他们不但要学会和掌握现代先进科学技术，还要了解和贯彻勤俭建国的方针。教育行政部门、各校党委和行政方面都应当重视这一工作，向一切教育行政人员和学校师生员工进行系统的思想教育，从思想上提高大家对勤俭办学方针的认识；同时也要采取一些组织措施，杜绝今后的铺张浪费。这是贯彻勤俭办学方针必须抓住的两个不可分离的重要环节。
    高等学校过去虽然开展过反浪费运动，但经验还不是很多的；青年学生有很高的社会主义热情，但容易抓住一面，忽略一面。因此，在反对铺张浪费现象的时候，教育行政部门必须注意加强领导。要肯定为了培养掌握现代科学技术的人才，必须有一定的物质条件；过去几年来，为了增进学生的身体健康，适当地改善学生的生活条件也是完全必要的。问题在于若干地方作得过分了，造成了浪费现象。这种现象是必须克服的；但应当本着实事求是的精神分清是非，对过去的各种制度和措施，进行细致的分析，应当肯定的加以肯定，应当改进的加以改进，应当取消的就取消。要防止已经在某些学校发生的过火现象，例如过多的降低伙食费用，教师大量地退宿舍用房，等等。这种不加分析的作法，对于办好我们培养社会主义建设人才的教育事业，也会产生不利的结果。
