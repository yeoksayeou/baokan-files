Four-Side Greening
Xiao Feng

“Beside every house, beside every village, beside every road, beside every waterway, wherever it is possible, trees must be planted in a planned manner” – National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft)

Trees line rivers and roads,
Flowers and orchards before and behind villages.
Barren beaches and alkaline land are full of trees,
Beautiful to see and valuable.

This is a song by the people of Zhouchen Township, Xia County, Shanxi Province, praising the achievements of the township's four-side greening. When you are led into the territory of the Friendly Agricultural Cooperative by rows of towering poplar trees on both sides of the highway, you can see crisscrossing, neatly arranged forests interspersed with patches of farmland and orchards. Roadsides, canal sides, well sides... all are shaded by green trees. New brick houses, like brides, are hidden in the lush greenery.

"Trees have roots, things have sources." To talk about the four-side greening of the Friendly Agricultural Cooperative, we must start with the blacksmith Xie. In 1932, Xie Jinwang, a blacksmith from Guodao Village, returned from Huayin, Shaanxi, bringing back two poplar saplings, which he planted beside the waterlogged land near the village. Because this type of tree grows quickly, has a straight trunk, and doesn't hinder farming, it was loved by the people, who eagerly cut branches and propagated them. By 1940, nearly ten thousand poplar trees had been planted on vacant land on all four sides of the village. However, they were all cut down during the period of enemy and puppet rule.

After liberation, after land reform and agricultural cooperativization, the masses' enthusiasm for planting trees was renewed, and four-side greening saw new development. Especially during the high tide of cooperativization in 1956, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the great call to "Green the Motherland in Twelve Years," setting off a high tide of four-side greening throughout the cooperative. To strengthen the leadership of this work, the cooperative set up a forestry section, formulated afforestation quotas, and uniformly arranged labor and work points. In that year, 66% of the cooperative members participated in four-side greening work, and the amount of afforestation exceeded that of 1955 by 69%. By the spring of 1957, the cooperative had completed the planting of more than 100,000 trees in large areas, greening the 35-li-long Dongya River, the Hongluo Canal and four other rivers, 14 large and small canals totaling 36 li in length, 306 wells, 75 li of highways, and 20 cart roads. The masses praised with satisfaction: "Between Zhongtiao (Mountain) and Emei (Ridge) is fertile land, lush green trees surround the manor, roadsides provide shade, large and small rivers have tree corridors." The Friendly Agricultural Cooperative effectively utilized wasteland, waterlogged land, and vacant land on all four sides, greening the villages, expanding the cultivated area, and increasing the income of the masses. For example, Liang Hongyuan's family in Guodao Village planted 5,000 poplar trees, occupying approximately 2.8 mu of waterlogged land. From 1952 to 1956, in addition to using the timber to build houses, they also earned more than 1,500 yuan. Gao Shouye of Chen Village planted 450 trees, earning a total of 1,330 yuan from 1948 to 1956; in 1957 alone, income from peaches and apricots amounted to 330 yuan. With other income from forestry, he successively built five houses, bought a cart, a mule, and a bicycle, and still had 120 yuan in the bank.

Although the four-side greening work of the Friendly Agricultural Cooperative has only been carried out for a few years, and most of the trees have not yet begun to yield benefits, the income from forestry already accounts for a large proportion of the cooperative's total income. From 1954 to 1956, the cooperative built more than 500 new houses, repaired more than 400 houses, built and repaired 94 carts, 136 waterwheels, 64 livestock sheds, 37 windmills, and many other farm tools. All these timbers were resolved by the cooperative itself. Afforestation also plays a significant role in developing animal husbandry, with the leaves of many trees serving as feed for pigs and sheep. From 1956 to the present, the number of pigs in this cooperative has increased from more than 280 to more than 500, and the number of sheep has increased from 270 to more than 370.

To further develop four-side greening, fully utilize vacant land and wasteland, and tap the potential of the land, the cooperative plans to continue planting 35,000 timber trees and 10,000 fruit trees on vacant land on all four sides. From 1958, it will afforest 100,000 to 150,000 trees on barren mountains every year, combined with the development of fruit trees. By 1962, all the vacant land and barren mountains on all four sides of the cooperative will be completely greened. At that time, the cooperative will be able to harvest 170,000 trees annually and produce 250,000 jin of various fruits. The income from these two items alone will reach more than 180,000 yuan, an average increase of more than 200 yuan per household, equivalent to 63% of the total income in 1956.

### 四旁绿化

    四旁绿化
    萧枫
    “在一切宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁，只要是可能的，都要有计划地种起树来”——全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）
    河边路边树相连，
    村前村后花果园。
    荒滩碱地栽满树，
    又好看来又值钱。
    这是山西省夏县周陈乡群众对本乡四旁绿化成就的歌颂。当你被耸立在公路两旁一排排钻天杨树引进友好农业社境域的时候，你就可以看到纵横交错、行列整齐的树林中夹着一块块的农田和成片的果园。路旁、渠旁、井旁……都是绿树成荫。一幢幢新砖房像新娘似的躲藏在碧绿的树丛里。
    “树有根、事有源”，提起友好农业社的四旁绿化，还要从谢铁匠谈起。1932年，郭道村铁匠谢金旺从陕西华阴回来，带回了两棵钻天杨树苗，插在村边的水浸地旁。由于这种树生长快、干直，不歇地，引起人们的喜爱，纷纷截枝插条。到1940年，全村在四旁空地上插钻天杨树将近万株。可是在敌伪统治时期都被砍光了。
    解放后，经过土地改革和农业合作化，群众栽树的劲头又足了，四旁绿化有了新的发展。尤其在1956年合作化高潮的时候，党中央、毛主席提出“十二年绿化祖国”的伟大号召，全社掀起了一个四旁绿化高潮。为了加强这一工作的领导，社里设置了林业股，制定了造林工作定额，统一安排劳动力和工酬。这一年就有66％的社员参加了四旁绿化工作，造林数超过1955年的69％。到1957年春季，全社共完成大面积植树十万多株，绿化了三十五里路长的洞崖河、洪洛渠等五条河流，三十六里长大小水渠十四条，水井三百零六眼，七十五里公路，大车路二十条。群众满意地称赞说：“中条（山）峨嵋（岭）之间是良田，碧绿的树林围庄园，道路两旁乘荫凉，大小河流树长廊”。友好农业社由于有效地利用了废地、水浸地和四旁空地，绿化了村庄，扩大了耕地面积，增加了群众的收入。如郭道村梁宏元家，先后栽钻天杨五千株，约占水浸地二点八亩，从1952到1956年除了用木材盖了房屋外，还收入了一千五百多元。陈村高守业植树四百五十株，从1948年到1956年共收入一千三百三十元；1957年仅桃杏两项就收入三百三十元，其它利用林业收入先后盖房子五间，买大车一辆、骡子一匹、自行车一辆，银行还存款一百二十元。
    友好农业社的四旁绿化工作虽然刚进行了几年，大部分林木还没有开始收益，但林业的收入在社里总收入中就已经占了很大比重。从1954—1956年三年间，全社共盖新房五百多间，修补房屋四百多间，新做和修理大车九十四辆、水车一百三十六台、牲口棚六十四个，风车三十七架，和其它许多农具。这些木材都是由社里自己解决的。植树造林对发展畜牧业也有很大作用，许多树的叶子可以作猪羊饲料。从1956年到现在这个社的生猪由二百八十多头增加到五百多头，羊由二百七十只增加到三百七十多只。
    为了进一步开展四旁绿化工作，充分利用空地、荒地，挖掘土地潜力，社里计划继续在四旁空地栽用材树三万五千株，果树一万株。从1958年开始，每年在荒山上造林十至十五万株，并结合发展果树。到1962年，全社所有的四旁空地、荒山都全部绿化，那时，全社每年可采伐木材十七万株，生产各种水果二十五万斤，只这两项收入就可达十八万多元，平均每户可增加收入二百多元，相当于1956年总收入的63％。
