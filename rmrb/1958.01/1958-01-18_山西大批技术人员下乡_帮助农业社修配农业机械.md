Shanxi Sends Large Numbers of Technicians to the Countryside
    Helping Agricultural Cooperatives Repair Agricultural Machinery
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Shanxi Provincial People's Committee recently organized 980 technicians and skilled workers from 51 factories and mining enterprises across the province to go to the countryside to help agricultural cooperatives repair power machinery, in order to support the great leap forward in agricultural production throughout the province.
    In recent years, agricultural power machinery in Shanxi Province has greatly developed. By the end of 1957, there were 3,931 sets of equipment such as portable steam engines, gas generators, and diesel engines in the countryside. These power machines play an extremely important role in realizing the great leap forward in agricultural production. However, it is understood that about 25% of the power machinery currently used in rural areas needs to be repaired. Some machinery cannot be used because parts are damaged or lost; some have reduced efficiency due to severe wear of parts; and some have been put aside because people do not know how to use them. Therefore, it is very timely for the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee to organize a group of technicians and skilled workers to go to the countryside for intensive repairs.
    The personnel drawn from various units are all skilled workers with a certain technical level, such as fitters, machinists, riveters, and electricians, as well as engineering technicians who can measure and draw parts diagrams of power machinery, and are equipped with the necessary administrative and political staff to be responsible for organizational leadership. In order to reduce the mobility of personnel, the method of county-by-county and area-by-area contract responsibility is implemented. Manpower is allocated according to the number of agricultural power machines in each special district and county. For example, Jieyu County, which has as many as 772 agricultural power machines, is contracted for by 120 personnel drawn from four units, including Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant. For Fanshi, Ningwu, and Pinglu counties, which currently have only one agricultural power machine, one or two repair personnel have been assigned according to the specific situation. (Huang Deshu)

    山西大批技术人员下乡
    帮助农业社修配农业机械
    本报讯　山西省人民委员会最近组织全省五十一个厂矿企业单位的九百八十名技术人员和技术工人，到农村帮助农业社修配动力机械，以支援全省农业生产大跃进。
    几年来，山西省农业动力机械有很大发展，截至1957年底，农村已有锅驼机、煤气机、柴油机等设备三千九百三十一部。这些动力机械对实现农业生产大跃进具有极其重大的作用。但是，据了解，目前农村使用的动力机械，约有25％左右需要修配。其中有些机械因为零件损坏丢失已不能使用；有的因机件磨损严重降低了效能；有些因为不会使用而搁置起来了。因此，山西省人民委员会组织了一批技术工人和技术人员下乡去进行突击修配，是十分适时的。
    在各单位抽调的人员中，都是具有一定技术水平的钳工、机工、铆工、电工等技术工人和能测绘动力机械零件图纸的工程技术人员，并配备了必要的行政和政治工作人员，负责组织领导工作。为了减少人员的流动性，实行了分县分片、包干负责的办法。根据各专、县农业动力机械的多少分配人力。如农业动力机械多至七百七十二部的解虞县，就由太原重型机器厂等四个单位抽调的一百二十名人员负责包干。对于目前还只有一部农业动力机械的繁峙、宁武、平鲁等县，也根据具体情况分别给分配去了一两名修配人员。　（黄德淑）
