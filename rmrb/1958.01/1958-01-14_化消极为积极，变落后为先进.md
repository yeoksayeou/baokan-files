    Transform the Negative into the Positive, Turn Backwardness into Advancement
    Zhang Pei
    The new spring of 1958 sees a thriving scene everywhere in the north and south of our country, and the socialist revolutionary spirit is surging across the country. Based on the new relations of production and under new conditions, a new high tide of socialist construction is rising one after another in various places, seemingly with greater momentum and more enthusiasm than the Great Leap Forward of 1956. This shows that after the nationwide rectification movement, our thinking has been further elevated, the country has become more consolidated, and our strength has become more abundant. However, amidst this riot of color, can we not find any traces of gray or hear any sighs, that is to say, have negative and conservative ideas been swept away completely? This does not seem to be the case. Didn't the newspapers a few days ago also report on the criticism of right-leaning conservatism in enterprises in Nanjing, Tangshan, Jiaozuo, and other places? Isn't the idea of "rather be conservative" (that is, rather be backward) still haunting the minds of some people? From this, it can be seen that it cannot be said that all comrades are standing at the same level. In this nationwide chorus of advancement, there are still differences in thinking between the advanced and the backward.
    Conservatism, generally speaking, is a reflection of thought lagging behind reality and leadership lagging behind the masses. This kind of backwardness is often manifested in underestimating or misjudging the current situation. Specifically, some comrades with conservative ideas (from the perspective of some enterprises) often overestimate the negative factors and underestimate the positive factors, or only see difficulties and only emphasize difficulties, without making the greatest efforts and using the greatest wisdom to transform negative factors into positive factors and turn backward situations into advanced situations. This involves both ideological methodology issues (subjectivity, one-sidedness) and ideological work style issues (lack of revolutionary drive to work hard and overcome difficulties).
    Doing anything has a difficult side. As for engaging in socialist undertakings, this is a great revolution, and difficulties are always waiting for us. Moreover, it is impossible to have no difficulties or smooth sailing in carrying out socialist construction in a country like China with a large population, poor foundation, and little land. On the contrary, there are not only difficulties, but also many difficulties. Blind optimism and failure to face these difficulties squarely is undoubtedly not a correct attitude. However, this is only one side of the matter. We must also see the other side of our national conditions, which is the positive and favorable side of overcoming difficulties: a large labor force, diligent and brave people, vast territory, good natural conditions, abundant underground resources, etc. These are all extremely favorable conditions and factors for building socialism. It can be seen that things are relative. We must see the difficult side so that we do not become blindly optimistic and extravagant, but rather conscientious and meticulous in handling all undertakings. We must also see the positive and favorable side that can overcome difficulties so that we do not become conservative and pessimistic, timid and hesitant, but rather full of confidence and enthusiasm in handling all undertakings. This means that we must examine, analyze, and compare things from two perspectives before we can draw correct conclusions.
    The situation is the same for a unit. The original production target for the Jingxi Coal Mine in 1958 was 2.85 million tons (which was already an increase of 500,000 tons compared to the actual production in 1957). Most of the comrades in the mining area party committee believed that this was already the "maximum limit," and it would be very difficult to increase it further. However, after they re-analyzed and compared the negative factors and favorable conditions, they believed that the production target could be increased to 3.2 million tons, a leap forward of 350,000 tons at once. This is one example. Another example is the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, which originally used a large proportion of important raw materials that could not be manufactured domestically and needed to be imported from abroad. In the first half of last year, the supply of foreign materials could not keep up, and the production of electron tubes was greatly threatened. This should be considered quite difficult, but they discovered favorable conditions for overcoming the difficulties, that is, the domestic industrial level was already capable of manufacturing these valuable raw materials, and the problem was to actively and proactively organize relevant units to cooperate in production. They did so, and as a result, they manufactured more than 480 kinds of key raw materials in the past year, ensuring the normal production of electron tubes. This is another example.
    It can be seen that difficulties are not absolute. Difficulties and advantages are a unity of opposites, and difficulties themselves contain factors for overcoming difficulties. On the reverse side of difficulties are various positive and favorable conditions, which is what we usually call having both spear and shield. The problem lies in whether we discover them, excavate them, find advancement from backwardness, and find solutions from difficulties, so that our subjective world conforms to the objective reality, instead of lagging behind it. When our understanding lags behind reality, we often look at problems from only one side, thus drawing incorrect conclusions.
    In these few years, the changes in our country's face have been so huge and rapid that it is not an exaggeration to describe these changes by saying that "seven days in the mountains is like thousands of years in the world". Our thinking must keep up with this great change, otherwise we will fall behind. At present, our agriculture, industry, and many other works are in the midst of a leap-forward high tide, and our thinking must adapt to the development of this situation. However, there are still some people whose thinking is like that of monks living in deep mountains, still going their own way. Others are already jumping, but he has not yet considered taking a step. Some people still remember how "launching" and "dismounting" in 1956 was, but as for how to move forward in 1958, he has not seriously thought about it. Some people are always willing to regard the word "difficulty" as their closest companion, like that special envoy in the play "Dawn Shines on Moscow," chanting all day long: "Difficulties, difficulties." These people have "too much criticism, inappropriate complaints, and endless worries," and ultimately, the negative and conservative ideas have not been eradicated.
    Of course, in the revolutionary cause, the factors of difficulty are often very prominent. Because what we are doing is not an ordinary thing, but a great cause of transforming the world upside down. We must change the relations of production, carry out revolution in ideology and politics, and change customs and transform the face of society. In the future, we must catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major industrial products in about fifteen years, and build our poor and blank country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. These are undoubtedly extremely arduous undertakings, things that have never been done by predecessors. Therefore, objectively, the factors of difficulty are always much greater than the favorable factors, and it can be said that they are full of all kinds of difficulties. However, our cause is always moving forward, because we are constantly overcoming difficulties and achieving one victory after another. The entire process of revolutionary struggle can also be said to be a process of constantly transforming the negative into the positive and turning backwardness into advancement.
    When some of our comrades estimate the situation, they often underestimate the reaction of our subjective initiative to the objective reality, often increasing the spirit of difficulty and destroying their own prestige, lacking a fearless revolutionary spirit of transforming the negative into the positive and turning backwardness into advancement.
    Examples of finding ways to transform the negative into the positive from difficulties are common in the entire revolutionary history of our Party. Now let's just cite an example from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region during the Anti-Japanese War. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his article "Economic and Financial Problems During the Anti-Japanese War": "In the past five years, we have gone through several stages. The greatest difficulty was in 1940 and 1941, during the two anti-communist frictions of the Kuomintang. We once reached the point where we had almost no clothes to wear, no oil to eat, no paper, no vegetables, soldiers had no shoes and socks, and staff members had no quilts in winter. The Kuomintang treated us by stopping funding and economic blockade, trying to starve us to death. Our difficulties were really great. But we overcame the difficulties. This was not only because the people of the border region gave us food to eat, but especially because we were determined to do it ourselves and established our own public economy. The border region government set up many self-sufficient industries; the army carried out a large-scale production movement, developing agriculture, industry, and commerce with self-sufficiency as the goal; and tens of thousands of institutions and schools also developed the same self-sufficient economy. ... We used these methods to overcome the difficulties." Every comrade who was on the scene at the time knew very well that our hundreds of thousands of troops, cadres, and students were facing the situation of starving to death. What to do? The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the way, which was "do it ourselves." Everyone went to reclaim wasteland, grow vegetables, and spin thread. As a result, we not only did not starve to death, but also achieved adequate food and clothing under the conditions at that time and place. It can be seen that there are completely ways to deal with difficulties. Now, our conditions are much better than before, so the favorable factors for overcoming difficulties are even greater. Our comprehensive and over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan is proof of this.
    The reason why we can give play to our subjective initiative to transform the negative into the positive and turn backwardness into advancement is because our Party is armed with Marxism-Leninism, has undergone severe tests in the long-term revolutionary struggle, understands the laws of social development and the actual situation of our country, has correct policies, and has flesh-and-blood ties with the hundreds of millions of masses. Therefore, no difficulty can stop the progress of the revolutionary cause. For us Communists, negative factors are always temporary, while the positive forces of the Party and the people to overcome negative factors are always the regular and decisive factors. Our task is to transform the negative into the positive and turn backwardness into advancement, otherwise we cannot be called Communists. And some comrades with conservative ideas lack this kind of understanding and this kind of enthusiasm.
    Of course, having only understanding and enthusiasm is sometimes not enough to effectively transform the negative into the positive and turn backwardness into advancement. Here, we also need correct leadership methods and working methods. Experience has proven that grasping advanced things and constantly promoting the development of socialist undertakings through the comparison between the advanced and the backward is a most effective method. Hong'an County, Hubei Province, uses the example of experimental fields to promote the development of agricultural production, which is such an excellent method and worthy of learning by comrades in various posts. With correct ideological understanding, revolutionary enthusiasm that relies on the masses, and correct methods, we will be invincible, all difficulties can be defeated by us, and all backwardness can be turned into advancement.
    Before today, we have overcome countless difficulties, thus achieving earth-shattering great victories. After today, the task is even more arduous, which is to establish a strong material foundation for modern industry and modern agriculture in our country, and to advance our country's industry, agriculture, and transportation industry from the backward technical track to the modern technical track, so as to fundamentally change the backward economic and cultural face of our country. The development of the objective situation guides us: after the completion of the socialist revolution in the economic, ideological, and political fields, an extremely great technical revolution is waiting for us to realize. Without this revolution, we cannot guarantee that our country will eventually be built into a socialist country with highly developed productive forces. Therefore, being only proficient but not revolutionary is of course subject to criticism, but being only revolutionary but not proficient is also subject to criticism. We do not want technicians who lose their way, nor do we want empty-headed politicians who are useless. Because both of these are negative factors for the socialist cause, not positive factors. Both are manifestations of backwardness, not manifestations of advancement. There is no doubt that there will still be one difficulty after another lying in front of us in the future, and our task is still to find ways to overcome them from the difficulties. The problem is that we must have a correct understanding of the constantly leap-forward development of the situation, have a dialectical way of thinking, and not always lag behind the objective reality. We must sweep away the twilight and conservatism, eliminate bureaucracy, and always have full revolutionary enthusiasm; we must have correct and effective leadership methods and working methods. In this way, we can constantly transform the negative into the positive and turn backwardness into advancement, so as to lead our country into an advanced, civilized, and strong socialist country within ten to fifteen years.

    化消极为积极，变落后为先进
    张沛
    1958年的新春，在我国的南方北方处处是一派兴旺气象，社会主义的革命干劲荡漾全国。在新的生产关系的基础上和新的条件下，一个新的社会主义建设高潮，正在各地前涌后起。看起来比跃进的1956年，劲头更大更足。这说明经过全民整风运动以后，我们的思想又提高了，国家更巩固了，力量更雄厚了。然而在这万紫千红之间，是不是就找不到一点灰色的痕迹、听不到一点叹息的声音、也就是说消极保守的思想已经一扫而光了呢？这似乎还不见得，你不见前几天的报纸上还登载着南京、唐山、焦作等地正在批判企业单位的右倾保守吗？“宁可保守一点”（也就是说宁可落后一点）的思想不是还在某些人的脑子里作怪吗？由此可见，还不能认为所有的同志都站在同一的水平上了。在这全国高歌前进的声中，也还存在着思想上先进和落后的差别。
    保守，一般地说，是思想落在实际后面、领导落在群众后面的反映。这种落后，往往是表现在对当前的形势估计不足或者估计不当。具体些说，一些有保守思想的同志（就一些企业单位来看），往往是对消极的因素估计过多，对积极的因素估计过少，或者是只看到困难、只强调困难，而不去尽最大的努力，用最大的智慧，化消极因素为积极因素，变落后的局面为先进的局面。这里面有思想方法问题（主观、片面），也有思想作风问题（缺乏艰苦奋斗战胜困难的革命干劲）。
    做任何事情，都有困难的一面。至于谈到做社会主义事业，这是一种伟大的革命，困难时时在等待着我们。而在中国这样一个人口多、底子穷、土地少的国家里搞社会主义建设，更不可能是毫无困难、万事亨通。相反，不仅有困难，而且有很多的困难。盲目乐观，不正视这些困难，无疑不是一种正确的态度。然而，这只是事情的一面。还必须看到我们国家情况的另外一面，这就是克服困难的积极有利的一面：劳动力多、人民勤劳勇敢、幅员广大、自然条件好、地下资源丰富等等，这些，都是建设社会主义极其有利的条件和因素。可见得事情是相对的。既要看到困难的一面，使我们不致盲目乐观、大手大脚，而是兢兢业业精打细算地去办一切事业。又要看到能够战胜困难的积极有利的一面，使我们不致保守悲观、小手小脚，而是信心充沛、干劲十足地去办一切事业。这就是说我们办事情看问题都要从两方面去考查、分析、对比，然后才能得出正确的结论。
    就一个单位来说，情况也是如此。京西煤矿原来制订的1958年的产量指标是二百八十五万吨（比1957年的生产实绩已经提高了五十万吨），矿区党委会的多数同志认为这已经是“最大限度”了，再往上升，就很困难了。可是当他们再度把消极的因素和有利的条件加以分析、对比以后，就认为产量指标能提高到三百二十万吨，一下又跃进了三十五万吨，这是一例。再如北京电子管厂，原来所用的重要原材料很大部分是国内不能制造而需要从国外进口的。去年上半年国外材料供应不上，电子管的生产受到很大威胁，这应当算是相当困难了，但他们发现了克服困难的有利条件，这就是国内的工业水平已经有可能制造这些贵重的原材料，问题在于要主动地积极地组织有关单位协作生产。他们这样做了，结果去年一年就制成了四百八十多种关键性的原材料，保证了电子管的正常生产。这又是一例。
    可见得困难并不是绝对的。困难和有利是对立的统一，困难本身就包含着克服困难的因素。在困难的反面有着各种积极的、有利的条件，也就是我们通常所说的有矛必有盾，问题在于我们去发现它、挖掘它，从落后中找出先进，从困难中找出办法，使我们的主观世界符合客观实际，而不是落在它的后面。当我们的认识落后于实际时，往往是只从一面看问题，从而得出了不正确的结论。
    在这几年中，我们国家面貌的变化是如此巨大和迅速，用“山中方七日，世上几千年”来形容这种变化也不为过分，我们的思想一定要赶上这种大变化，否则就要落后。目前，我国的农业、工业和其它许多工作又处在一个跃进式的高潮中间，我们的思想就要适应这种形势的发展。可是还有一些人的思想像独处深山的僧人一样，依然我行我素。别人已经在跳，他还没有考虑跨步子。有的人还念念不忘1956年“上马”“下马”如何如何，至于1958年怎样前进，他还没有认真地想一想。有的人永远愿意把“困难”这两个字当作最亲密的伴侣，像“曙光照耀着莫斯科”一剧中那个特派员一样，整天地念着：“困难哪，困难。”在这些人身上有着：“过多的评头品足，不适当的埋怨，无穷的忧虑”，归根结底是消极保守的思想尚未根除。
    当然，在革命事业中，困难的因素，常常是很突出的。因为我们所做的事情，不是什么普通的事情，而是翻天覆地的改造世界的大事业。要变革生产关系，要在思想上政治上进行革命，要移风易俗改变社会面貌。在今后来说，要在十五年左右在主要工业品的产量方面赶上和超过英国，把我们这个又穷又白的国家，建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。这些，无疑是极端艰巨的事业，是前人未做过的事。因此客观上困难的因素比起有利的因素总是大得多，可以说是充满了各式各样的困难。然而我们的事业总是在不断地前进，这是因为我们总是不断地在战胜困难，取得一个又一个的胜利。整个革命斗争的过程，也可以说是不断地化消极为积极、变落后为先进的过程。
    我们有些同志在估计形势的时候，对于我们的主观能动性对客观现实的反作用往往估计不足，常常是长困难的志气，灭自己的威风，缺乏一种大无畏的化消极为积极、变落后为先进的革命精神。
    从困难中找出办法化消极为积极的例子，在我党整个革命历史中是屡见不鲜的，现在随便举一个抗日战争时期陕甘宁边区的例子。毛泽东同志在“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”一文中说：“五年以来，我们经过了几个阶段。最大的一次困难是在一九四○年和一九四一年，国民党的两次反共磨擦，都在这一时期。我们曾经弄到几乎没有衣穿，没有油吃，没有纸，没有菜，战士没有鞋袜，工作人员在冬天没有被盖。国民党用停发经费和经济封锁来对待我们，企图把我们困死，我们的困难真是大极了。但是我们渡过了困难。这不但是由于边区人民给了我们粮食吃，尤其是由于我们下决心自己动手，建立了自己的公营经济。边区政府办了许多的自给工业；军队进行了大规模的生产运动，发展了以自给为目标的农工商业；几万机关学校人员，也发展了同样的自给经济。……我们就用这些办法战胜了困难。”每个身临其境的同志都很清楚，当时我们十几万军队、干部、学生面临着困死、饿死的局面。怎么办？党中央和毛泽东同志指出了办法，这就是“自己动手”。每个人都去开荒、种菜、纺线，结果我们不仅没有饿死，而且做到当时当地条件下的丰衣足食。可见得对付困难是完全有办法的。现在，我们的条件比那时好了不知多少倍，因而克服困难的有利因素也就更多了。我们全面超额地完成了第一个五年计划就是证明。
    我们所以能发挥主观能动性化消极为积极、变落后为先进，是因为我们的党是用马克思列宁主义武装起来的，在长期的革命斗争中经过严重的考验，它通晓社会发展的规律和我国的实际，它有正确的政策，它和千百万群众有着血肉的联系。因此，任何困难都阻挡不住革命事业的前进。对于我们共产党人来说，消极因素总是暂时的，而党和人民群众克服消极因素的积极力量总是经常起作用的、决定性的因素。我们的任务就是化消极为积极，变落后为先进，否则我们就不能叫做共产党人了。而一些有保守思想的同志，就缺乏这种认识，缺乏这种干劲。
    自然，光有认识，光有干劲，有时还不能有效地化消极为积极，变落后为先进。这里还需要有正确的领导方法和工作方法。经验证明，抓住先进的事物，从先进和落后的对比中不断促进社会主义事业的发展，是一项最有效的方法。湖北省红安县用试验田的榜样来促进农业生产的发展，就是这样一种极好的方法，值得各种岗位上的同志学习。有了正确的思想认识，有了依靠群众的革命干劲，又有了正确的方法，我们就会无往而不利，一切困难都能被我们打倒，一切落后都可以变为先进。
    在今天以前，我们曾经战胜了无数的困难，因而取得了惊天动地的巨大胜利。在今天以后，任务更加艰巨，这就是要在我国建立起现代工业、现代农业的强大的物质基础，要把我国的工业、农业、运输业从落后的技术轨道上推进到现代化的技术轨道上去。从而从根本上改变我国经济文化落后的面貌。客观形势的发展指引我们：在经济上、思想上、政治上的社会主义革命完成以后，一个极其伟大的技术革命在等待着我们去实现。没有这个革命，就不能保证把我们的国家最终建成为一个具有生产力高度发展的社会主义国家。因此，只专不红固然要受到批判，只红不专也要受到批判。我们不要迷失方向的技术家，我们也不要一无所长的空头政治家。因为这两者，对于社会主义事业都是消极的因素，而不是积极的因素。都是落后的表现，而不是先进的表现。毫无疑问，今后仍然有一个又一个的困难横在我们面前，我们的任务仍然是要从困难中找出办法从而战胜它。问题是我们对形势的不断飞跃发展，要持有正确的认识，要有辩证的思想方法，不要老是落在客观实际的后面。要扫除暮气和保守，打掉官风，永远有饱满的革命干劲；要有正确有效的领导方法和工作方法。这样我们就能不断地化消极为积极、变落后为先进，从而在十年到十五年以内，把我们的国家导进为一个先进的文明的社会主义强国。
