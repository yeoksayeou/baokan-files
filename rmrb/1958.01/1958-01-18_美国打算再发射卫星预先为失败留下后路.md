Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 17th: Following the great shock in the United States caused by the burning of the American "Vanguard" rocket during testing last December, American newspapers have recently revealed that authorities are preparing for another "Vanguard" rocket test. However, the American authorities, who once boasted greatly about the previous test, only to become a laughingstock around the world, dare not do so again this time.

Secretary of the Navy Gates issued a special statement on the 13th, saying that the possibility of a six-inch "earth satellite" test sphere entering orbit in future tests is "small." Gates also paved the way for another possible failure. He said, "The second stage, loaded with a complex guidance system, has never been tested in flight," and "the mechanics of the third stage for launching the satellite have not been tested under actual flight conditions."

The Department of Defense has also taken special measures to prevent the disclosure of the exact time of the test.

Meanwhile, Air Force Missile Chief General Schriever expects the United States to launch a "military satellite" specifically for military reconnaissance next spring.

The American magazine "New Republic" continues to comment on last year's "blown-up" "Vanguard" test. The magazine wrote: The explosion at Cape Canaveral was so deafening that its significance far exceeded any other event in recent history.

It said: The explosion of a test rocket is in itself a common occurrence. But the significance this time lies in the immeasurable and tremendous sound it caused. "Advertising propaganda" blew up. This loud noise may have damaged the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and made people all over the world laugh.

The magazine continued: "The most devastating explosion was not the rocket, but the credibility of the United States."

    美国打算再发射卫星预先为失败留下后路
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：关于去年12月美国“先锋号”火箭在试验中烧毁事件在美国国内引起很大震动以后，美国报纸最近又在透露当局在准备再试验一次“先锋”火箭。但是，上次曾经大肆吹嘘而结果成为世界笑柄的美国当局这次不敢再这样做了。
    海军部长盖茨13日特别发表声明说，在未来的试验中，一个六英寸的“地球卫星”试验球体进入轨道的可能性是“小”的。盖茨还为再一次试验可能失败先开了后路。他说，“装载着复杂的导引系统的第二节从来没有在飞行中试验过”，“发射卫星的第三节的机械也没有在实际的飞行情况下试验过”。
    国防部并且已采取特别措施，防止把试验的确实时间透露出去。
    同时，美国空军导弹负责人施里弗少将指望美国明年春天能发射一个专门用来作军事侦察的“军事卫星”。
    美国“新共和”杂志继续在评论去年的“吹炸了”的“先锋”试验。这家杂志写道：卡纳维拉尔角发生的爆炸是这样震耳欲聋，这次爆炸的意义远远超过了近几年来历史上的其他任何事件。
    它说：试验火箭爆炸本身是一件平常的事。但这一次的意义在于，它引起了无法估量的巨大的声响。“广告式的宣传”吹炸了。这一声巨响可能破坏了北大西洋公约组织，并且使全世界人民哈哈大笑。
    杂志继续写道：“最有毁灭性的爆炸倒不是火箭，而是美国的威信。”
