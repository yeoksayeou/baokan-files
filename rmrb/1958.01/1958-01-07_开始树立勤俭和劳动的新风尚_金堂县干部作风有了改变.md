A New Trend of Thrift and Labor Begins to Take Root
Jintang County Cadre Work Style Changes

    (Reported by this newspaper) Since the rectification campaign began in the fifteen county-level agencies of Jintang County, Sichuan Province, cadres have accepted the opinions of the masses and resolutely improved their work style. From the County Party Secretary and the County Head to all 430+ town-based agency cadres, all have been using their rest time and holidays to engage in regular physical labor such as raising pigs, accumulating manure, opening up wasteland, and repairing roads. This has established a new trend of thrift and labor, which has been unanimously praised by local farmers and residents. According to statistics, in just over half a month, more than 1.7 million catties of manure have been accumulated, nearly 200 cubic meters of stones and river sand have been picked and transported for road repair, 24 mu of wasteland have been opened up for planting vegetables and feed, and more than 100 pigs have been raised.

    Jintang County's county seat is located in Zhao Town, and all life customs are closely connected with the surrounding rural areas. However, in the past, whenever off work and on holidays, cadres from the agencies would go in groups of two or three to parks, shopping streets, or theaters, or play poker and chess. The environmental sanitation of some agencies was also poor, and some garbage had been piled up for several years without anyone clearing it. These phenomena aroused dissatisfaction among the local masses and seriously affected the relationship between cadres and the masses.

    Since the rectification campaign began, in conjunction with the discussion of the Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), Comrade Ma Yu, Secretary of the Jintang County Party Committee, called on all agency cadres to establish a new trend of thrift and labor, actively use their spare time to carry out physical labor such as accumulating manure and raising pigs, and use practical actions to support agricultural production and strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses. All units responded to the call and established labor organizations and systems. Generally, it is stipulated that at least three afternoons of off-work rest time each week should be used to participate in physical labor. In the labor, the County Party Secretary, the County Head, and the responsible comrades of various departments all personally came to the construction site to participate in the labor. Li Ziqing, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee and County Head, picked up stones to repair roads and cleared ditches to accumulate fertilizer along with his comrades. Wang Haoren, Minister of the Organization Department of the County Party Committee, carried a load of seventy or eighty catties to transport stones, river sand, and slag fertilizer back and forth. More than 400 cadres in the county, except for the weak, pregnant women who stayed in the agency to watch the door, were all mobilized to accumulate fertilizer and transport stones to repair the township road. Zheng Yongqing, director of the County Insurance Company, accumulated more than 3,000 catties of fertilizer in twenty days. Each unit also opened up wasteland in front of and behind the houses and on the river beaches to plant feed and vegetables, and vigorously raise pigs to accumulate fertilizer. Each unit also plans to establish regular contact with nearby agricultural cooperatives and contract to supply them with the fertilizer and labor they need.

    Cadre participation in physical labor has played a significant role in changing customs. In the past, some cadres were somewhat afraid of fatigue and embarrassment when carrying a hoe or a load of bamboo baskets through the streets. Now, even female comrades, like male comrades, are carrying loads and pulling carts, walking through the streets and alleys, working with great enthusiasm. Residents in the town are also learning from the cadres and organizing to carry out manure accumulation and patriotic health campaigns. Some residents who used to be idle and sit in teahouses or stroll the streets are now too embarrassed to wander around and are looking for work to do. The surrounding farmers immediately changed their views of the cadres. They said, "You improve after we make suggestions, you are really good cadres of Chairman Mao who are both literate and martial."

### 开始树立勤俭和劳动的新风尚  金堂县干部作风有了改变

    开始树立勤俭和劳动的新风尚
    金堂县干部作风有了改变
    本报讯　四川金堂县县级十五个机关整改以来，接受群众意见，坚决改进了干部作风。从县委书记、县长到所有驻城的机关干部四百三十多人，都利用休息时间和假日，普遍开展了经常性的养猪、积肥、开荒、修路等体力劳动，树立了勤俭和劳动的新风尚，受到当地农民和居民一致赞扬。据统计，半个多月共积肥一百七十多万斤，为修路拣运石头、河沙近二百立方，开荒种菜种饲料二十四亩，养猪一百多头。
    金堂县城设在赵镇，一切生活习俗与四周的农村紧密联系着。但是，过去每当下班和休假日，机关干部成群结队、三三两两不是游公园、逛街坊、上戏院，就是打扑克、下象棋。有的机关的环境卫生也搞得不好，有些垃圾堆了好几年，也无人清除。这些现象，引起当地群众不满，严重影响了干群关系。
    整改以来，结合讨论农业发展纲要（修正草案），中共金堂县委书记马钰同志，号召全体机关干部树立勤俭和劳动的新风尚，积极利用闲暇时间开展积肥、养猪等体力劳动，以实际行动支援农业生产，密切干群关系。各单位纷纷响应号召，建立劳动组织和制度。一般规定，每周至少有三个午后下班休息时间用来参加体力劳动。在劳动中，县委书记、县长和各部门的负责同志，都亲临工地参加劳动。县委副书记兼县长李子青和同志们一道拣石头修路，清沟积肥。县委组织部长王浩仁挑七、八十斤重的担子，来回运石头、河沙和渣肥。全县四百多个干部，除体弱、孕妇留机关看门外，全部出动积肥和运石头修乡场大路。县保险公司主任郑永清二十天就积肥三千多斤。各单位还在屋前屋后、河边沙滩上，开荒种植饲料和菜蔬，大力养猪积肥。各单位并计划分别和附近农业社取得经常联系，包干供给他们需要的肥料和劳动力。
    机关干部参加体力劳动，起到了移风易俗的显著作用。过去，有些干部拿把锄头、挑担箩蔸过街，都有些怕累、怕难为情。现在，连女同志也和男同志一样，挑担拉车，穿街过巷，干得特别起劲。镇上居民也向干部学习，组织起来开展积肥和爱国卫生运动。有些闲散坐茶馆、逛街坊的居民，现在也不好意思闲逛，都在找活路干。四周农民对干部的看法立即改变了。他们说：“提了意见就改进，你们真是毛主席的能文又能武的好干部。”
