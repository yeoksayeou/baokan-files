Refuting Liu Huizhi's "Supreme Supervision Theory"
　　Wang Guiwu

In the struggle to counter the bourgeois rightists, the Supreme People's Procuratorate exposed the anti-Party and anti-socialist activities of the bourgeois rightist Liu Huizhi. In the two-line struggle in procuratorial work, Liu Huizhi was a representative of the anti-Marxist-Leninist, anti-socialist procuratorial work line and an agent of the bourgeois rightists within the procuratorial organs. He attempted to tamper with the dictatorial functions of the people's procuratorial organs and pull procuratorial work to the right.

We know that the people's procuratorial organs are one of the tools of the people's democratic dictatorship. Their task is to exercise dictatorship over all class enemies, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements such as hooligans, gangsters, thieves, fraudsters, arsonists, and murderers, to safeguard the socialist system and order, and to safeguard the democratic rights of the broad masses of the people. However, Liu Huizhi advocated and disseminated a so-called theory of "supreme supervision," "supervision of supervision," and "second-line supervision" that is incompatible with the people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist legal system. What is "supreme supervision," "second-line supervision," and "supervision of supervision"? According to him, the "illegal phenomena" of our state organs and cadres are "very serious," and it is not enough to rely solely on the supervision of the competent departments and state supervisory organs. Moreover, these organs are not entirely reliable, and they will engage in illegal activities while supervising illegal activities. Therefore, it is necessary for the procuratorial organs to supervise them again. This is the origin of the so-called "supervision of supervision" and "second-line supervision." Here, Liu Huizhi envisioned a supervisory system, placing the inspection and supervision work of other departments at the lower level of this system, while placing the supervision of the procuratorial organs at the highest level, above everything else, implementing "supreme supervision."

Implementing this theory will inevitably lead to two results: first, weakening and negating the dictatorship, turning the spearhead of the procuratorial organs' dictatorship over class enemies against the people's own state organs and cadres; second, placing the procuratorial organs above everything else, making them immune to any supervision, thereby confronting the Party and replacing the Party's power to supervise state work. Obviously, this theory is extremely absurd and reactionary, and it must be refuted.

According to the provisions of our country's Constitution and the Organic Law of the People's Procuratorates, the duty of the procuratorial organs is to exercise procuratorial power in accordance with legally prescribed procedures. There is no provision for the procuratorial organs to exercise "supreme procuratorial power" or "supreme supervisory power." Furthermore, the Organic Law of the People's Procuratorates stipulates the powers of the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the powers of the local people's procuratorates at all levels separately, as stipulated in Articles 3 and 4 of the law. According to the so-called "supreme supervision," not only the Supreme People's Procuratorate exercises supreme supervisory power, but also the local people's procuratorates at all levels, down to the grassroots people's procuratorates, exercise "supreme supervisory power." This has no legal basis and is an illegal statement. In fact, from the perspective of our country's system, the exercise of supreme supervision over state work should be within the authority of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, because the National People's Congress is the highest organ of state power. From the perspective of political leadership over state work, the Communist Party is the leading core of our country, which is clearly stipulated in the Constitution. Therefore, only the Party can exercise the highest leadership and supervision over state work, and it must be exercised by the Party. The claim that the procuratorial organs should exercise "supreme supervision," if not intentionally distorting the law, must be an attempt to confront the Party.

In Liu Huizhi's "supreme supervision theory," he particularly emphasized the role of the general supervision work of the procuratorial organs and distorted the content of general supervision work. The term "general supervision" does not exist in law. It is a commonly used term in procuratorial work, and its content mainly refers to the supervisory work of the procuratorial organs on the legality of the resolutions, orders, and measures of relevant state organs. According to the practical experience of our country's procuratorial organs in recent years, since the vast majority of our state organs and cadres resolutely abide by and uphold the law, illegal phenomena among state organs and cadres are rare. In particular, major illegal events that need to be resolved through general supervision do not occur frequently. Therefore, general supervision work should not be carried out as a regular and main task of the procuratorial organs. However, Liu Huizhi distorted and one-sidedly emphasized the role of general supervision work, saying that "general supervision work is the fundamental difference between the procuratorial work of socialist countries and the procuratorial work of capitalist countries." It seems that if general supervision work is not carried out according to his proposition, the socialist nature of our country's procuratorial work will be changed. This statement is very absurd. We know that the nature of a country's procuratorial organs is determined by the nature of the country, that is, which class leads the country and exercises dictatorship over which class. The socialist nature of our country, the leadership of the Communist Party, and the people's democratic dictatorship are the fundamental conditions that determine the socialist nature of our country's procuratorial work. In the task of realizing the people's democratic dictatorship, general supervision work is only one of its forms of struggle, and this form of struggle must be closely coordinated with other measures to consolidate the dictatorship. Since illegal phenomena among our state organs and cadres are rare, general supervision cannot become a regular and main task of the procuratorial organs in general. Therefore, the socialist nature of our country's procuratorial work is not determined by whether or not general supervision work is placed in a primary position. All of these are very clear principles, and there is nothing to doubt or dispute. So, why has general supervision work become the focus of debate in the two-line struggle in procuratorial work? The essence of the problem lies in: We believe that the spearhead of general supervision work should be directed at those major illegal events that violate the socialist legal system and the principle of democratic centralism, that is, to use this weapon to consolidate the socialist legal system, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and democratic centralism; while Liu Huizhi attempted to direct the spearhead of general supervision work to the general shortcomings and errors of state organs in the implementation of laws, and to attack those cadres who have general shortcomings and errors in their work, and these problems originally belong to the scope of general ideology and work style, and should be solved by democratic methods, according to the formula of "unity-criticism-unity". Obviously, if general supervision work is carried out according to Liu Huizhi's opinion, the socialist nature of procuratorial work will really change, because in that way, its spearhead of struggle against the enemy will turn against the people, it will no longer be a tool of the proletarian dictatorship, but will become something that the bourgeois rightists like.

By understanding the content and role of general supervision work, we can know that the general supervision of the procuratorial organs and the administrative supervision of the competent departments are different in the scope and nature of their work. That is, the administrative supervision of the competent departments mainly checks the implementation of the work, while the general supervision of the procuratorial organs mainly checks major illegal events related to violations of the socialist legal system and the principle of democratic centralism, and it is not intended to add another layer of supervision to the administrative supervision of the competent departments. Therefore, Liu Huizhi's fallacies such as "supervision of supervision" and "second-line supervision" cannot be interpreted in any other way except to replace the Party's power to supervise state work.

Based on his theory of "supreme supervision," Liu Huizhi also distorted the system of division of labor and mutual restraint between the procuratorial organs and relevant departments. As everyone knows, according to the provisions of our country's laws, the procuratorial organs, public security organs, and courts implement a system of division of labor, mutual responsibility, and mutual restraint in their work. For example, the procuratorial organs review cases submitted by the public security organs for approval of the arrest of criminals and decide whether to approve the arrest or not; review cases transferred by the public security organs for prosecution after the completion of the investigation and decide whether to prosecute or not. The public security organs have the right to submit opinions or complaints to the people's procuratorate at the next higher level when they believe that the decisions made by the procuratorial organs not to approve the arrest and not to prosecute are wrong. This is more conducive to preventing and correcting errors and accurately and effectively打击 the enemy. Here, the division of labor between the procuratorial organs and relevant departments is a division of labor on the common task of unified struggle against the enemy. Although the specific duties are different, the goals and tasks are completely consistent. At the same time, the relationship between the procuratorial organs and the public security and judicial organs is a parallel working relationship of division of labor and cooperation between fraternal departments, that is, mutual coordination, mutual support, mutual restraint, and mutual supervision, rather than riding above the relevant departments and implementing any "supreme supervision". However, Liu Huizhi openly proposed to supervise the public security and judicial organs "in the capacity of supervisor," attempting to place the procuratorial organs above the public security and judicial organs. Moreover, he departed from the basic task of the procuratorial organs to exercise dictatorship over class enemies and departed from the principle of unified struggle against the enemy with relevant departments, isolatedly and one-sidedly emphasizing the supervisory role of the public security organs and courts, thus actually replacing the function of unanimously exercising dictatorship over class enemies with the supervision of public security and judicial cadres. He did not use the role of mutual restraint and mutual supervision to打击 crimes more accurately and effectively, but used legal supervision specifically to pursue the so-called "illegal acts" of the public security and judicial organs in打击 crimes. That is to say, the relevant departments are pursuing crimes in front, and the procuratorial organs are following behind to pursue their "illegal acts," which is actually tying the hands and feet of the struggle against the enemy. "The public security organs are against the counter-revolutionaries, and the procuratorial organs are against the public security organs." This is a pointed portrayal of Liu Huizhi's "supervision theory." Obviously, this practice will inevitably lead procuratorial work away from the track of dictatorship and变质 procuratorial work, which is absolutely unacceptable.

Liu Huizhi's advocacy of the "supreme supervision" theory is by no means an accidental prejudice in business thinking, but has deep roots in understanding. For a long time, Liu Huizhi has held the view of the extinguishment of class struggle and the theory of no enemy. As early as after the liberation of Northeast China in 1948, he said that "the class struggle has passed, and the main task in the future is to struggle against nature." However, as everyone knows, at that time, a large part of the country had not been liberated, the land reform in the newly liberated areas had not yet been carried out, and even the task of the democratic revolution had not been completed. How could it be said that the class struggle had passed? After 1956, Liu Huizhi even emphasized: "We have entered socialism, the class struggle has ended, the mass movement has ended, there will be no struggle in the future, and the main thing is all kinds of construction." On the other hand, he tried his best to exaggerate the illegal situation of cadres, saying that "judging from the situation in China, our grassroots organizations violate resolutions and orders relatively more, and cadres' violations of laws and disciplines are even more," "There are many illegal phenomena, and it is not enough to rely solely on some supervisory organs, but also the supervision of the procuratorial organs, that is, the supervision of supervision." Based on this understanding and estimate of the situation, Liu Huizhi concluded that there will be no class struggle in the future, and the main thing is to struggle against the illegal phenomena of state cadres. His "supreme supervision theory" is based on this so-called objective basis of the extinguishment of class struggle and the serious violation of laws by state organs and cadres. This is obviously a reactionary view that cancels class struggle and cancels the revolution.

As everyone knows, due to the great victory of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, there are fewer counter-revolutionaries, but there are still counter-revolutionaries. Due to the victory of our country's five major movements and three major socialist transformations, the domestic large-scale mass class struggle has basically ended, but the class struggle has not been extinguished, and it can be re-sharpened under certain conditions. Before the entire transition period is over, the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism will always exist and become the main contradiction in the country. Moreover, after the end of the transition period, as long as imperialism and the bourgeoisie still exist in the world, the class struggle will continue. These basic estimates must be affirmed and adhered to. As long as there are still enemies at home and abroad, as long as the state has not withered away, that is, as long as there are still procuratorial organs, it must be a tool for exercising dictatorship over the enemy. It must not be said that because the number of enemies has decreased, the nature and tasks of the procuratorial organs can be changed, and its spearhead of struggle can be turned against the people. Because the procuratorial organs are tools of dictatorship, and the system of dictatorship is not applicable within the people.

Regarding the compliance of state organs and staff with the law, it should be affirmed that the vast majority of our state organs and staff loyally support the Constitution and laws and resolutely implement the Constitution and laws. The consolidation of our country's socialist legal system and the unprecedented stability of social order are inseparable from the efforts of the vast number of state organs and staff. Illegal phenomena in state organs are not the main trend, and it is impossible for them to become the main trend in our country. Some of the so-called illegal phenomena that rightists are currently exaggerating and rendering are actually only general shortcomings and errors in work. According to their nature, they do not belong to the category of illegal crimes at all. At the same time, it must also be seen that even if there are some illegal phenomena in state work, most of them are caused by class aliens, bad elements, and degenerated elements who have sneaked into state organs, and the illegal acts among revolutionary cadres are very individual.

By analyzing the above situation, Liu Huizhi's lies about the extinguishment of class struggle and the serious violations of laws by state cadres can be self-defeating, and his so-called "supreme supervision theory" will lose all basis.

From the above, it can be seen that our differences with Liu Huizhi are by no means general business viewpoints and academic ideological disputes, but political and ideological struggles concerning major issues of right and wrong in procuratorial work, which are directly related to the direction of procuratorial work and the consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship. This two-line struggle in procuratorial work has existed for a long time, and since the advent of the high tide of the socialist revolution, especially since the rectification movement, the struggle has become more intense and acute. Liu Huizhi's absurd remarks have had a long-lasting, wide-ranging, and deeply毒害 influence in the procuratorial organs. We must thoroughly refute his fallacies and achieve a complete victory in the struggle so that procuratorial work can develop healthily and victoriously along the socialist direction and along the road of consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

    驳刘惠之的“最高监督论”
    王桂五
    最高人民检察院在反击资产阶级右派的斗争中，揭露了资产阶级右派分子刘惠之的反党、反社会主义的活动。在检察工作两条道路的斗争中，刘惠之是反马列主义、反社会主义的检察工作路线的代表者，是资产阶级右派在检察机关内的代理人。他企图篡改人民检察机关的专政职能，把检察工作拉向右转。
    我们知道，人民检察机关是人民民主专政的工具之一，它的任务是对一切阶级敌人、反革命分子和流氓、阿飞、盗窃、诈骗、杀人放火犯等坏分子实行专政，维护社会主义的制度和秩序，维护广大人民的民主权利。但是，刘惠之却倡导和散布了一种同人民民主专政和社会主义法制不相容的所谓“最高监督”“监督的监督”、“二线监督”的理论。什么是“最高监督”、“二线监督”、“监督的监督”呢？根据他的说法，是由于我们国家机关和干部的“违法现象很严重”，仅依靠主管部门和国家监察机关的监督还不够，而且这些机关也不完全可靠，它们在监督违法中还要发生违法现象，所以必须要有检察机关再对它们加以监督。这就是所谓“监督的监督”、“二线的监督”的由来。在这里，刘惠之设想了一个监督体系，他把其他部门的检查监督工作放在这个体系的下层，而把检察机关的监督放在这个体系的最高层，凌驾于一切之上，实行“最高监督”。
    执行这种理论，不可避免地会发生这样两个结果：一是削弱专政和否定专政，把检察机关对阶级敌人实行专政的锋芒，掉转头来对准人民自己的国家机关和干部；一是把检察机关驾于一切之上，使其不受任何监督，从而同党分庭抗礼，并且取代党对国家工作的监督权。显然，这种理论是十分荒谬的、反动的，必须加以驳斥。
    按照我国宪法和人民检察院组织法的规定，检察机关的职务是按照法律规定的程序行使检察权，并未规定检察机关行使“最高检察权”或“最高监督权”，并且在人民检察院组织法中对最高人民检察院的职权和地方各级人民检察院的职权分别加以规定，即该法第三条和第四条的规定。而按照所谓“最高监督”的说法，则不仅最高人民检察院实行最高监督权，而且地方各级人民检察院直至基层人民检察院，也是实行“最高监督权”了。这是没有法律根据的，是违法的言论。事实上，从我们国家的体制来说，对于国家工作实行最高监督，应当是全国人民代表大会和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的权限，因为全国人民代表大会是国家的最高权力机关。从对国家工作的政治领导来说，共产党是我们国家的领导核心，这是宪法上明文规定的，因此，只有党才能对国家工作实行最高的领导和监督，而且也必须由党来实行最高的领导和监督。那种主张由检察机关实行“最高监督”的说法，如果不是有意歪曲法律，那就必然是企图和党分庭抗礼了。
    在刘惠之的“最高监督论”中，他特别强调检察机关的一般监督工作的作用，并且歪曲了一般监督工作的内容。关于一般监督这个名词，在法律上是没有的，它是检察工作上习用的一个术语，它的内容主要是指检察机关对有关国家机关的决议、命令和措施是否合法的监督工作。根据几年来我国检察机关的实践经验，由于我们的国家机关和干部绝大多数都是坚决地遵守法律和维护法律的，国家机关和干部违法的现象很少，尤其属于需要用一般监督来解决的重大违法事件并不是经常会发生的，所以不应当把一般监督工作作为检察机关的经常的主要的工作来进行。而刘惠之则歪曲和片面强调一般监督工作的作用，说什么“一般监督工作是社会主义国家的检察工作同资本主义国家检察工作的根本区别”。似乎不按照他的主张进行一般监督工作，就会改变我国检察工作的社会主义性质了。这种说法是很荒谬的。我们知道，一个国家的检察机关的性质决定于这个国家的性质，即这个国家是由那个阶级领导的，对那个阶级实行专政。我们国家的社会主义性质，共产党的领导和人民民主专政，是决定我国检察工作社会主义性质的根本条件。检察机关在实现人民民主专政的任务中，一般监督工作仅仅是它的一种斗争形式，而且，这种斗争形式还必须与其他巩固专政的措施密切配合。由于我们国家机关和干部的违法现象很少，所以在一般的情况下，一般监督就不可能成为检察机关经常的和主要的工作。因此，我们国家检察工作的社会主义性质并不是决定于是否把一般监督工作摆在主要位置上。所有这些，都是十分明白的道理，本来没有什么可以怀疑和争论的。那么，为什么在检察工作两条道路的斗争中，一般监督工作成为争论的焦点呢？问题的实质是在于：我们认为一般监督工作的锋芒应该是向着那些违反社会主义法律制度、违反民主集中制的重大违法事件，也就是说要运用这个武器来巩固社会主义的法律制度，巩固人民民主专政和民主集中制；而刘惠之则企图把一般监督工作的锋芒指向国家机关在执行法律上的一般性质的缺点和错误，打击那些工作上有一般缺点错误的干部，而这些问题本来是属于一般思想作风的范畴，应当用民主的方法，按照“团结——批评——团结”的公式加以解决的。显而易见，如果按照刘惠之的意见进行一般监督工作，检察工作的社会主义性质才真的要发生变化，因为那样它的对敌斗争锋芒将会掉转头来对准人民内部，它将不再是无产阶级专政的工具，而将成为资产阶级右派所喜欢的东西了。
    了解了一般监督工作的内容和作用，我们就可以知道，检察机关的一般监督同主管部门的行政监督工作在工作范围和性质上都是不相同的。即主管部门的行政监督主要是检查工作的执行情况，而检察机关的一般监督工作主要是检察有关违反社会主义法制、违反民主集中制的重大违法事件，并不是要对主管部门的行政监督工作，再加上一层监督。因此，刘惠之所谓“监督的监督”、“二线监督”等谬论，除了取代党对国家工作的监督权之外，是不可能作别的解释的。
    刘惠之根据他的“最高监督”的理论，对于检察机关同有关部门之间的分工负责、互相制约的制度，也加以歪曲。大家知道，按照我国法律的规定，检察机关同公安机关和法院在工作中实行分工负责、互相制约的制度。例如，检察机关审查公安机关提请批准逮捕人犯的案件，决定批准逮捕或者不批准逮捕；审查公安机关侦查终结移送起诉的案件，决定起诉或者不起诉。而公安机关对于检察机关所作出的不批准逮捕和不起诉的决定，认为有错误的时候，有权向上一级人民检察院提出意见或者控告。这样更加有利于防止和纠正错误，准确地有效地打击敌人。在这里，检察机关同有关部门之间的分工负责，是在统一对敌斗争的共同任务上的分工，具体的职务虽有不同，而目的和任务是完全一致的。同时，检察机关同公安、司法机关的关系是兄弟部门之间分工合作的平行的工作关系，也就是互相配合，互相支持，互相制约，互相监督，而不是凌驾于有关部门之上，实行什么“最高监督”。但刘惠之却公开提出要“以监督者的身份”对公安、司法机关实行监督，企图把检察机关驾于公安、司法机关之上。他并且离开检察机关对阶级敌人实行专政的基本任务，离开同有关部门统一进行对敌斗争的原则，孤立地片面地强调对公安机关和法院的监督作用，因而在实际上是以监督公安、司法干部，代替了协同一致对阶级敌人实行专政的职能。他不是通过互相制约和互相监督的作用来更加准确地有效地打击犯罪，而是要运用法律监督专门去追究公安、司法机关在打击犯罪中的所谓“违法行为”。这就是说，有关部门在前面追究犯罪，检察机关跟在后面追究他们的“违法”，实际上是束缚对敌斗争的手足。“公安机关是对反革命的，检察机关是对公安机关的”，这是对刘惠之的“监督论”的一针见血的写照。显而易见，这种作法必然要使检察工作离开专政轨道，使检察工作变质，这是绝对不能容许的。
    刘惠之主张“最高监督”论，决不是偶然的业务思想上的偏见，而是有着深刻的认识上的根源的。长期以来刘惠之就抱着一种阶级斗争熄灭论和无敌论的观点。早在1948年东北解放以后，他就说什么“阶级斗争已经过去，以后的任务主要是向自然作斗争了”。可是任何人都知道，当时全国还有很大一部分地区没有解放，新解放区的土地改革尚未进行，连民主革命的任务都未完成，怎么就说阶级斗争已经过去了呢？在1956年以后，刘惠之更是强调说：“已进入社会主义，阶级斗争已经结束了，群众运动结束了，今后没有什么斗争了，主要是各项建设了”。另一方面，他却竭力夸大干部的违法情况，说什么“以中国的情况而论，我国基层组织的违犯决议、命令就比较多了，干部的违法乱纪就更多了”，“违法现象很多，单靠一些监察机关还不够，还需要检察机关的监督，即监督的监督”。根据这种对形势的认识和估计，刘惠之就得出结论说，今后没有阶级斗争了，主要是同国家干部的违法现象作斗争了。他的“最高监督论”就是建立在这种阶级斗争熄灭、国家机关干部违法严重的所谓客观根据之上的。这显然是一种取消阶级斗争，取消革命的反动观点。
    人们都知道，由于肃反斗争的伟大胜利，反革命分子少了，但是还有反革命分子存在。由于我国五大运动和三大社会主义改造的胜利，国内大规模的群众性的阶级斗争已经基本上结束，但是阶级斗争并没有熄灭，而且在一定条件下可以重新尖锐化。在整个过渡时期没有结束以前，将始终存在着资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争，并且成为国内的主要矛盾。而且在过渡时期结束之后，只要世界上还存在着帝国主义和资产阶级，阶级斗争也还会继续存在。这些基本的估计，是必须加以肯定和坚持的。只要国内外还有敌人存在，只要国家还没有消亡，也就是说只要还有检察机关，它就必须是一个对敌人专政的工具，决不能说因为敌人减少了，就可以改变检察机关的性质任务，就可以把它的斗争锋芒转向人民内部。因为检察机关是专政的工具，而专政的制度是不适用于人民内部的。
    关于国家机关工作人员遵守法律的情况，应该肯定的说：我们的国家机关工作人员绝大多数都忠诚地拥护宪法和法律，并且是坚决地执行宪法和法律的。我国社会主义法制的巩固，社会秩序的空前安定，是同广大国家机关工作人员的努力分不开的，国家机关中的违法现象不是主要的倾向，而且在我们的国家里也不可能成为主要倾向。目前右派分子所夸大渲染的有些所谓违法现象，实际上只是工作上一般性质的缺点和错误，按其性质来说，根本不属于违法犯罪的范畴。同时还必须看到，在国家工作中即使存在着一些违法现象，大多数也是由于混入国家机关中的阶级异己分子、坏分子和蜕化变质的分子兴风作浪所造成的，真正属于革命干部中的违法行为是很个别的。
    分析了上面的情况，刘惠之所谓阶级斗争熄灭、国家干部违法严重的谎言就可以不攻自破了，而他的所谓“最高监督论”也就失去了一切根据。
    由上述可知，我们同刘惠之的分歧，决不是一般的业务观点和学术思想的争论，而是有关检察工作上的大是大非的政治斗争和思想斗争，直接关系着检察工作的建设方向，关系着人民民主专政的巩固。检察工作中这个两条道路的斗争是长期来就存在着的，而自社会主义革命高潮到来，特别是整风运动以来，斗争就更加剧烈和尖锐化了。刘惠之的荒谬言论在检察机关中的影响，时间很长，范围很广，毒害很深。我们必须彻底驳倒他的谬论，取得斗争的彻底胜利，使检察工作沿着社会主义的方向，沿着巩固人民民主专政的道路，健康地胜利地向前发展。
