(Reported by our newspaper) Leaders in some counties, townships, and communes in Guangdong Province have begun to go deep into construction sites during the high tide of water conservancy construction, strengthening inspection and acceptance procedures, and conducting propaganda and education work for cadres and laborers in order to prevent and correct the phenomenon of neglecting quality.

According to the inspection by the Hepu Special District, among the more than 10,000 small-scale water conservancy projects that have been completed, there are a few projects with very poor quality. In Nali and Dongchang townships of Qin County in the district, eight projects were found to be substandard. In two locations, the dikes and dams were found to have cracks shortly after completion. In Yingde County of the Shaoguan Special District, inspections revealed that six projects needed to be reworked, wasting a total of 7,000 labor days. The Hepu County Party Committee found that the quality of the Shanyao Reservoir was not good, so it convened an enlarged meeting of the general party branch at the construction site and decided to strengthen technical education for the laborers. It also convened a war-time meeting of water conservancy technicians from the entire county to study the technical problems existing in the water conservancy movement. The CPC Hepu Prefectural Committee and many counties have also particularly emphasized the issue of engineering quality at various meetings recently held. Qin County has also established a system stipulating that projects benefiting an area of more than 1,000 mu must be inspected and accepted by the Party Secretary of the large township; projects benefiting an area of less than 500 mu must be inspected and accepted by the Party Branch Secretary of the agricultural cooperative. In Qingyuan County of the Shaoguan Special District, many water conservancy construction sites have vigorously promoted the "more, faster, better, and more economical" guiding principle and the slogan "A project for a hundred years, quality first". They commend laborers with high work efficiency and good work quality, and through a large-scale debate on engineering quality issues, use the method of finding harm and carefully accounting to criticize the mistakes of some cadres and laborers who are careless, seeking quickness, pursuing quantity without quality, and pursuing work points regardless of quality.

    兴修水利既要多又要好
    钦县规定受益千亩以上工程由大乡党委书记验收
    本报讯　广东有些县乡社的领导，在兴修水利的高潮中已注意深入工地，加强检查验收和对干部民工的宣传教育工作，以防止和纠正忽视质量的现象。
    据合浦专区的检查，在已完成的一万多宗小型水利当中，也有少数工程，质量很差。该区钦县的那丽、东场两个乡就发现有八宗工程不合规格，其中两处的堤坝完工不久就发现龟裂。韶关专区英德县检查出有六宗工程要返工，共浪费七千个劳动力。合浦县委检查出山窑水库质量不好，便召开工地党总支部扩大会议，决定对民工加强技术教育；还召集全县水利技术人员开战地会议，研究水利运动中存在的技术问题。中共合浦地委和许多县也都在最近召开的各种会议上特别强调工程质量问题。钦县还订出制度，规定受益面积千亩以上的工程，要由大乡党委书记检查验收；受益面积五百亩以下的，由农业社党支部书记检查验收。韶关专区的清远县，许多水利工地都大张旗鼓展开宣传“多快好省”的方针和“百年大计，质量第一”的口号，表扬劳动效率高、工作质量好的民工，又通过对工程质量问题的大辩论，用找危害、算细账办法，批判部分干部和民工马虎图快、求多不求好、追求工分不顾质量的错误。
