Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Washington Dispatch: The U.S. government officially released on the 12th President Eisenhower's reply to Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin. Because Bulganin's peace initiatives aroused a wide and profound response, the U.S. government spent a great deal of time studying, drafting, and revising this reply. However, from this reply, it can be seen that the U.S. government continues to hold a negative attitude towards seeking to ease the international situation through genuine negotiation.

Considering the increasingly intense criticism from Western European allies and the broad public within the United States, this reply did not dare to directly close the door on the issue of East-West summit talks. Eisenhower had to state that "direct contact may be valuable" between the heads of government of Eastern and Western countries and expressed willingness to discuss the various proposals put forward by the Soviet side and the U.S. side. However, he put forward "preconditions" for holding such talks, that is, "sincere preparatory work" must be carried out in advance through diplomatic contact or foreign ministers' meetings. In this way, it is obviously easier for the United States to postpone the issue of convening a summit meeting as much as possible.

Eisenhower used many words in his reply to talk about America's "desire for peace," portraying the U.S.'s criminal record of foreign aggression and expansion over the past forty years as a "record of peace." He defended the U.S.'s various measures to exacerbate international tensions, while distorting and slandering the Soviet Union's peaceful policies. But he could not deny after all that the United States is currently maintaining various aggressive military blocs around the world, and the spearhead of these blocs is precisely aimed at the Soviet Union.

Eisenhower took a negative attitude towards many important Soviet peace initiatives. Using the pretext that the UN Charter already had provisions, he insisted that the Soviet proposals on concluding a treaty of non-aggression between East and West, that countries possessing atomic weapons should not use these weapons, respecting the independence of Middle Eastern countries, ensuring no use of force in the Middle East, and developing friendly and peaceful cooperation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union were all "inappropriate." Regarding the Soviet proposal, widely supported in Western Europe, to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, Eisenhower said that it "would not be of much significance." At the same time, the United States does not intend to accept the Soviet proposal to stop nuclear weapons testing within two or three years and the proposal on the German question.

Eisenhower put forward the U.S.'s so-called counter-proposals in his reply. These proposals are actually reiterating the U.S.'s various aggressive policies, but he demanded that the Soviet Union agree to these proposals to show "sincerity" in reconciliation. He stated that the United States advocates "strengthening the United Nations," the way to do this is to abolish the principle of great power unanimity in the Security Council, implement restrictions on the use of the veto, in order to facilitate U.S. manipulation. The United States demanded that the Soviet Union accept the West's proposal to hold so-called "free elections" in Germany in order to extend West Germany's political system to the German Democratic Republic, and to discuss the so-called "situation in Eastern European countries" proposed by the West, which aims to interfere in the internal affairs of the Eastern European People's Democracies. In terms of disarmament negotiations, the United States still insisted on its past position, for example, to link the issue of stopping atomic weapons testing with the issue of stopping the production of such weapons. Eisenhower also emphasized the so-called proposals to establish supervision to prevent surprise attacks and the peaceful use of outer space.

It can be seen from the Reuters Washington dispatch on the 12th that Eisenhower's reply was mainly drafted by Secretary of State Dulles, who stubbornly opposed negotiation. Despite increasingly frequent accusations from domestic and foreign public opinion, the U.S. government continues to act according to the "Dulles line."

    艾森豪威尔复信给布尔加宁
    搬出先决条件阻挠真正协商
    新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：美国官方12日公布了美国总统艾森豪威尔给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的复信。由于布尔加宁提出的和平倡议引起了广泛和深刻的反响，美国政府曾经花费许多时间研究起草和修改这封复信。但是从这封复信中可以看出，美国政府继续对通过真正的协商来谋求缓和国际局势抱否定态度。
    考虑到西欧盟国和美国国内广大公众越来越激烈的批评，这封复信在东西方最高级会谈问题上没有敢于直截了当地关上大门。艾森豪威尔不得不表示，东西方国家政府首脑的“直接接触可能是有价值的”并且表示准备同苏联领导人讨论苏联方面和美国方面提出的各种建议。但是，他为举行这种会谈提出了“先决条件”，这就是事前必须先进行外交接触或者举行外长会议来进行“具有诚意的准备工作”。这样一来，显然就便于美国把召开最高级会议问题尽可能地拖延下去。
    艾森豪威尔在复信里用了许多词句来谈论美国的“和平愿望”，把过去四十年来美国对外侵略扩张的罪恶纪录说成是“和平的纪录”。他为美国各项加剧国际紧张局势的措施辩护，同时歪曲和诬蔑苏联和平的政策。但是他毕竟无法否认，美国目前正在世界各地维系着各种侵略性的军事集团，这种集团的矛头正是针对着苏联的。
    艾森豪威尔对苏联的许多重要的和平倡议都采取否定的态度。他以联合国宪章已有规定为借口，硬说苏联提出的关于缔结东西方互不侵犯条约、拥有原子武器的国家不使用这些武器、尊重中近东国家的独立、保证不在中东使用武力、发展美苏之间的友好和和平合作关系等建议都是“不适当”的。对于苏联提出的在西欧受到广泛支持的关于在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议，艾森豪威尔说，它“不可能有多大意义”。同时，美国也不打算接受苏联关于在两三年内停止试验核武器和关于德国问题的建议。
    艾森豪威尔在复信中提出了美国的所谓反建议。这些建议实际上都是重申美国的各项侵略性政策，但是他却要求苏联同意这些建议以表明和解的“诚意”。他表示，美国主张“加强联合国”、办法就是取消安全理事会中大国一致原则，实行限制使用否决权，以便于美国的操纵。美国要求苏联接受西方关于在德国举行所谓“自由选举”以便把西德的政治制度扩展到德意志民主共和国的主张，并且要讨论西方提出的目的在于干涉东欧人民民主国家内政的所谓“东欧国家局势”问题。在裁军谈判方面，美国仍然坚持过去的立场，例如要把停止试验原子武器的问题同停止生产这种武器的问题连在一起。艾森豪威尔还强调所谓建立监督防止突袭和和平利用外层空间等建议。
    从路透社华盛顿12日消息中可以看出，艾森豪威尔的这封复信主要是由顽固地反对协商的国务卿杜勒斯起草的。尽管遭到国内外舆论日益频繁的指责，美国政府继续按照“杜勒斯路线”办事。
