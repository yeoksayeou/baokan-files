Explanation on the Issue of Appropriately Increasing the Proportion of Public Accumulation Funds in Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
Minister of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China, Liao Luyan

I. In order to further expand reproduction, achieve a leap forward in agricultural production, strive to catch up with or exceed the production and income levels of local well-to-do middle peasants during the Second Five-Year Plan period, and realize the National Agricultural Development Program in the next ten years, agricultural producers' cooperatives must actively increase basic agricultural construction (including: water conservancy projects, adding livestock and farm tools, purchasing pest control machinery, etc.) to continuously expand reproduction and continuously increase the income of cooperative members. To increase basic construction, agricultural cooperatives must invest a certain amount of labor and capital. Generally, agricultural cooperatives have sufficient labor, and the funds mainly rely on the cooperatives themselves to solve. Because agricultural cooperatives are collectively owned, not owned by the whole people. The profits of state-owned enterprises owned by the whole people are turned over to the state and included in the state budget revenue. The investment required to increase basic construction and expand reproduction is naturally allocated from the state budget. If the investment required for agricultural cooperatives with collective ownership to increase basic construction and expand reproduction is also allocated from the state budget, it is obviously not allowed by the state's financial resources, and it must be mainly solved by the agricultural cooperatives themselves. The state will of course do its best to provide necessary assistance. Agricultural cooperatives relying on their own strength to gradually increase some basic construction is not only a reliable way to develop production and increase income, but also the material foundation for consolidating the socialist cooperative system. With larger public property, agricultural cooperatives will be as solid as steel and concrete.

1956 was the first year of realizing advanced cooperation nationwide. When agricultural cooperatives distributed income, they adopted the principle of deducting less and distributing more to ensure that the income of most members increased in the first year after joining the cooperative, which was beneficial. However, with the continuous development of agricultural production, on the premise of ensuring that the income of the vast majority of members increases year by year, it is completely necessary to appropriately increase the public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives and appropriately increase the proportion of the public accumulation fund. Only by increasing public accumulation and carrying out more basic construction can agricultural cooperatives continuously expand reproduction, continuously increase the income of members, and make the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives obtain a reliable guarantee.

II. Based on the facts of agricultural production development and the improvement of farmers' living standards in recent years, it is also completely possible to appropriately increase the public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives. In 1956, 80% of cooperatives and 75% of members nationwide increased production and income. 1957 was a moderate year, and the production of grain and various crops increased compared with 1956. Cotton increased by 3.9 million dan compared with 1956, and pigs increased by more than 30 million heads. There are already 65 counties (cities) nationwide where the average yield of grain per mu has reached the target of 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin respectively; there are already 184 counties (cities) where the average yield of ginned cotton per mu is 40 jin, 60 jin, 80 jin, or 100 jin, and there are 4,186,000 mu of cotton fields with a yield of more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. According to several typical surveys, the increase in production and income of agricultural cooperatives in 1957 was also higher than in 1956. According to incomplete statistics from Shandong, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Hebei, Guangdong, Liaoning, Hubei, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Fujian and other provinces, about 20% or 30% of agricultural cooperatives have caught up with or exceeded the production and income levels of local well-to-do middle peasants. The average production level in the Zhangye area of Gansu Province has caught up with the production level of local well-to-do middle peasants, and the income level of 70% of members has caught up with or exceeded the income level of local well-to-do middle peasants. The average income of each farmer household in Dunhuang County is 1,577 yuan (there are a total of 9,904 farmer households in the county), and the average income per person is 277.6 yuan (the total rural population in the county is 53,744). Judging from the deposits of rural credit cooperatives, according to statistics from the People's Bank of China, it was 1.08 billion yuan in 1956, an increase of about ten times compared with 1953, and reached 1.8 billion yuan in December 1957. A considerable number of agricultural cooperatives have also accumulated some reserve grain. For example, according to incomplete statistics from Guizhou Province, the reserve grain of cooperatives reached 200 million jin. According to statistics from six counties and 5,320 cooperatives in the Xiangtan area of Hunan Province, they have stored more than 50 million jin of grain, with an average of nearly 10,000 jin per cooperative. According to statistics from 4,927 cooperatives in the Tangshan and Tongxian areas of Hebei Province, 1,407 cooperatives have accumulated reserve grain, accounting for 28% of the total number of cooperatives. This shows that increasing the proportion of public accumulation funds in agricultural cooperatives is not only necessary, but also possible.

III. Since the second half of 1957, a socialist education movement has been widely carried out in rural areas, the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) has been promulgated, and a nationwide discussion has been launched. A new upsurge in agricultural production has already been formed. Appropriately increasing the public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives in order to increase basic agricultural construction and realize a leap forward in agricultural production has become the demand of most agricultural cooperatives. In 1957, the proportion of public accumulation funds in agricultural cooperatives generally increased compared with 1956. In fact, a number of cooperatives have already exceeded 8% or 12% of the proportion of public accumulation funds. For example, according to a survey of 2,559 cooperatives in Henan Province, 947 cooperatives had a public accumulation fund accounting for more than 8% of net income in 1957, accounting for 37% of the surveyed cooperatives. For example, in the Tongxian area of Hebei Province, the public accumulation funds of cooperatives generally reached 8% in 1957, and a few cooperatives reached more than 15%. In the Longyan area of Fujian Province, the proportion of public accumulation funds in some cooperatives with more forestry income reached about 20%. These facts show that the provisions in the model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives regarding "the public accumulation fund generally does not exceed 8%" and "the public accumulation fund of cooperatives engaged in economic crops can reach 12%" need to be revised. As long as it is discussed and approved by the members' congress or the members' representative congress in accordance with the model charter, it should be allowed for the proportion of public accumulation funds in general agricultural cooperatives to exceed 8%; it should also be allowed for the proportion of public accumulation funds in agricultural cooperatives engaged in economic crops to exceed 12%. Otherwise, it will not be able to meet the needs of objective practical development. The original regulations in the model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives stipulated that "in the event of a famine year, the public accumulation fund can be retained less or not at all. In the event of a bumper year...the public accumulation fund can also be retained more as appropriate." This provision is still valid. However, this provision refers to famine years or bumper years. In order for the public accumulation fund of cooperatives to exceed 8% or 12% in moderate years, the charter must still be amended as described above.

IV. On the other hand, whether to increase the proportion of the public accumulation fund and how much to increase it must still be based on the actual conditions of various regions and agricultural producers' cooperatives, and must still adhere to the premise of continuous development of production and the annual increase in the income of members, and must not be increased too much. Therefore, when changing the regulations on the proportion of public accumulation funds, it should also be pointed out that "it should also not be exceeded too much, so as not to affect the annual increase in the income of the vast majority of members." In order to prevent the problem of excessive increases, we have also considered making a decision on the maximum limit. However, the conditions in various places and cooperatives across the country are different. If the limit is set too low, there will still be exceedances; if the limit is set too high, it will easily cause some agricultural cooperatives that do not have the conditions to retain public accumulation funds according to the highest standard. Therefore, no maximum limit has been stipulated, but only the principle of "not exceeding too much, so as not to affect the annual increase in the income of the vast majority of members" is pointed out in principle as a policy boundary.

    关于适当提高高级农业生产合作社公积金比例问题的说明
    中华人民共和国农业部部长　廖鲁言
    一、农业生产合作社为了进一步扩大再生产，实现农业生产的跃进发展，争取在第二个五年计划时期内赶上或者超过当地富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平，并且在今后的十年内实现全国农业发展纲要，就必须积极增加农业生产的基本建设（包括：兴修水利，添置牲畜农具，购置除虫器械，等等）从而不断地扩大再生产，不断地增加社员收入。农业合作社为了增加一些基本建设，就必须付出一定的劳力和资金。一般的农业社劳力是充足的，资金也主要靠农业社自己去解决。因为，农业社是集体所有制，不是全民所有制。全民所有制的国营企业，它的利润是上缴给国家，列入国家预算收入的，它增加基本建设和扩大再生产所需要的投资，自然也由国家预算拨付。集体所有制的农业合作社增加基本建设和扩大再生产所需要的投资，如果也要由国家预算拨付，显然是国家的财力所不允许的，必须是主要靠农业社自己的力量去解决，国家当然尽力给予必要的援助。农业合作社依靠自己的力量逐步增多一些基本建设，不仅是发展生产增加收入的可靠道路，而且又是巩固社会主义的合作化制度的物质基础。有了较大的公共财产，农业社就会像钢骨水泥般的巩固起来。
    1956年是全国实现高级合作化的第一年，农业社分配的时候，采取了少扣多分的原则，保证大多数社员入社后第一年的收入就有所增加，这是有好处的。但是，随着农业生产的不断发展，在保证绝大多数社员的收入逐年有所增加的条件下，适当增加农业社的公共积累，适当提高公积金的比例，则是完全必要的。只有增加公共积累，多办一些基本建设，才能使农业社不断地扩大再生产，不断地增加社员收入，使农业社的巩固获得可靠的保证。
    二、根据近年来农业生产的发展和农民生活水平提高的事实，适当地增加农业社的公共积累，也有着完全可能的条件。1956年全国已有80％的社和75％的社员增产增收。1957年是中等年景，粮食和各种农作物比1956年都有增加，棉花比1956年增加三百九十万担，猪增加三千多万头。粮食每亩平均产量分别达到了四百斤、五百斤和八百斤指标的，全国已经有六十五个县（市）；棉花每亩平均产皮棉四十斤、六十斤、八十斤或者一百斤的，已经有一百八十四个县（市），亩产一百斤皮棉以上的棉田有四百一十八万六千亩。据若干典型调查，1957年农业社增产增收的幅度，也比1956年高。山东、山西、浙江、陕西、江西、河北、广东、辽宁、湖北、吉林、黑龙江、福建等省不完全的统计，有20％左右或者30％左右的农业社，已经赶上或者超过了当地富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平。甘肃张掖专区全区平均的生产水平已经赶上当地富裕中农的生产水平，已经有70％的社员的收入水平赶上或者超过了当地富裕中农的收入水平。敦煌县全县平均每个农户收入一千五百七十七元（全县共九千九百零四户农户），每人平均二百七十七元六角（全县农村人口共五万三千七百四十四人）。再从农村信用社的存款看，据中国人民银行的统计，1956年是十亿八千万元，比1953年约增加十倍，1957年12月已经达到十八亿元。有相当部分农业社还积蓄了一部储备粮，例如：贵州省不完全统计，合作社的储备粮达两亿斤。湖南湘潭专区六个县五千三百二十个社的统计，储备五千多万斤粮食，平均每社近一万斤。河北唐山、通县两个专区四千九百二十七个社统计，已有一千四百零七个社积蓄了储备粮，占总社数28％。这就说明，增加农业合作社公积金的比例，不但是需要的，而且是可能办到的。
    三、1957年下半年以来，在农村中，广泛开展了社会主义教育运动，公布了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），展开了全民讨论，新的农业生产高潮已经形成。适当增加农业社的公共积累，以便增多一些农业生产的基本建设，实现农业生产的跃进发展，已经成为大多数农业社的要求。1957年农业社公积金的比例一般都比1956年增加了。实际上已经有一批合作社公积金的比例超过了8％或者12％。例如，河南省调查二千五百五十九个社，1957年公积金占纯收入8％以上的即有九百四十七个社，占调查社数的37％。又如河北省的通县专区1957年合作社的公积金一般都达到8％，有少数社达到15％以上。福建龙岩专区有些林木收入较多的合作社，公积金的比例达到20％左右。这些事实说明，高级农业生产合作社示范章程关于“公积金一般地不超过8％”，“经营经济作物的合作社，公积金可以达到12％”的规定，需要加以修改。只要按照示范章程，经过社员大会或者社员代表大会讨论通过，一般农业社公积金的比例超过8％，是应该允许的；经营经济作物的农业社公积金的比例超过12％，也是应该允许的。否则，就不能适应客观实际发展的需要。高级农业生产合作社示范章程原来规定：“遇到荒年，公积金可以少留或者不留。遇到丰年，……公积金也可以酌量多留。”这一规定，仍然有效。但是，这一规定是指荒年或者丰收年的。为了在中等年成，合作社的公积金也可以超过8％或者12％，仍然要对章程作上述的修改。
    四、另一方面，公积金的比例增加与否和增加多少，仍然必须从各个地区、各个农业生产合作社的实际状况出发，仍然必须坚持以不断发展生产和社员收入逐年有所增加为前提，不能增加过多。因此，在改变公积金比例规定的时候，应该同时指出：“也不宜超过太多，以免影响绝大多数社员收入的逐年增加”。为着防止增加过多的毛病，也曾经考虑过做出最高限度的决定。但是，全国各个地方各个合作社情况不一，限度规定得太低，还是会有超过的；限度规定得太高，反而容易引起某些条件不具备的农业合作社也按最高标准去扣留公积金。因此，没有规定最高限度，而只从原则上指出“不宜超过太多，以免影响绝大多数社员收入的逐年增加”，做为政策界限。
