Xinhua News Agency, London, January 5th: TASS reports that Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki explained to the "Sunday Times" foreign affairs commentator Carroll the reasons for the Polish government's proposal to establish a neutral zone without atomic weapons in Europe.

	Rapacki said that we urgently hope for a stable situation, to ease international tensions, guarantee peaceful coexistence, and conduct international economic and cultural cooperation. In addition, we hope to finally establish relations with the whole of Germany on the basis of mutual security and good-neighborly cooperation. This is of great significance not only to Poland, but also to Germany and the whole of Europe.

	Rapacki said: Adopting Poland's proposal will help ease tensions in Europe, restore mutual trust, open the way for the realization of other disarmament measures, and help resolve other complex disputes. He emphasized that Poland's proposal is concrete and includes all kinds of nuclear weapons. He said that the purpose of Poland's proposal is not to affect the current balance of power in Europe, because it treats the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization equally.

	Rapacki also pointed out that the deployment of atomic weapons in West Germany and the equipping of the West German army with nuclear weapons would intensify the arms race in Europe and further divide Europe into mutually hostile blocs. In the situation where Europe is divided into two hostile blocs, in an atmosphere of arms race, fear and mutual distrust, the process of German unification will not develop well. Therefore, Poland's proposal may indirectly promote the process of German unification.

    波外长谈倡议建立无原子区理由
    希望缓和国际局势并同全德国建立关系
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社伦敦5日讯：波兰外交部长腊帕茨基向“星期日泰晤士报”外交评论员卡罗尔说明了波兰政府建议在欧洲建立一个没有原子武器的中立地区的理由。
    腊帕茨基说，我们迫切希望时局稳定，缓和国际紧张局势，保证和平共处以及进行国际经济和文化合作。此外，我们希望终于能在互相安全和睦邻合作的基础上同整个德国建立关系。这样做不仅对波兰，同时对德国和整个欧洲都具有重要意义。
    腊帕茨基说：采纳波兰的建议将有助于缓和欧洲紧张局势，恢复相互间的信任，为实现其他裁军措施开辟道路，并且有助于解决其他复杂的争端。他强调指出，波兰的建议是具体的，包括各种核武器。他说，波兰的建议的目的不是要影响欧洲现在的力量对比关系，因为它对北大西洋公约组织国家和华沙条约国家是平等对待的。
    腊帕茨基还指出：在西德设置原子武器以及用核武器装备西德军队会加剧欧洲的军备竞赛，并且使欧洲更加分裂成彼此敌对的集团。而在欧洲分裂为两个敌对集团的情况下，在军备竞赛、恐惧和互不信任的气氛下，德国统一的过程是不会得到良好发展的。因此，波兰的建议也许可以间接地促进德国统一的过程。
