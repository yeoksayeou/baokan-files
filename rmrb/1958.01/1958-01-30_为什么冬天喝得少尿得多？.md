Why Do We Drink Less and Urinate More in Winter?

The importance of water to the human body is well known. A person can go without food for days, even starve for a month, and not die, but they cannot survive without water for a few days.

The water intake and expenditure of a healthy person are roughly as follows:

　　Intake: From beverages 600 ml
　　　　　From food 1600 ml
　　　　　Produced after food digestion 400 ml
　　　　　Total 2600 ml

　　Expenditure: Excreted by the kidneys (urine) 1500 ml
　　　　　　　Excreted by sweat 600 ml
　　　　　　　Exhaled by the lungs as water vapor 400 ml
　　　　　　　Excreted by feces 100 ml
　　　　　　　Total 2600 ml

This accounting, though not precise, is generally suitable for all seasons.

So, why do we drink less water in winter but urinate more? This is quite clear; the "more" and "less" are only relative, and we are deceiving ourselves. While it's true we drink less water in winter, the majority of the water our bodies absorb comes from food. People's appetites generally increase in winter, and the water absorbed from food compensates for the lack of drinking water. In short, from a total intake perspective, the amount of water the body takes in from outside isn't small, it's just from a different source.

Now, let's look at the "expenditure" of water! There are four routes: the amount of water lost through the lungs and feces doesn't vary much with the seasons. That leaves sweat and urine. It's either less sweat and more urine, or more sweat and less urine. In the hot summer, the body must evaporate a lot of sweat to carry away excess heat, so naturally, there will be less urine. In winter, we only sweat a few hundred milliliters (because sweating too much makes people feel cold), so the body's water can only be eliminated through urination. All in all, it's still a "balanced" budget. (Mu Feng)

### 为什么冬天喝得少尿得多？

专栏：为什么

    为什么冬天喝得少尿得多？
    水分对于人体的重要性，是人所共知的。一个人可以几天不吃饭，甚至饿到一个月也不会死，可是只要几天不喝水，就活不下去了。
    一个健康人身体里水的收、支情况，大概是这样：
    收　入来自饮料　600毫升来自食物　1600毫升食物消化后产生　400毫升共计　2600毫升
    支　出由肾排出（尿）　1500毫升由汗排出　600毫升由肺呼出水汽　400毫升由大便排出　100毫升共计　2600毫升
    这篇流水账虽然不算精确，但却一年四季都大致适合。
    那么，为什么冬天水喝得少，而尿反而多呢？这是很明白的，多和少只是相对的，是我们自己受骗了。冬天固然喝水少了点，但我们身体吸收的水分绝大多数来自食物。冬天人们食欲普遍增加，从中吸收的水，补充了喝水的不足。总之，从总收入来看，身体从体外摄入的水分并不算少，只是来源不同罢了。
    再从水的“支出”方面来看吧！四条路：其中从肺和大便这两条路走的水分，同季节的影响不算太大；剩下汗与尿两条路，要不是汗少尿多，就是汗多尿少。夏天天气炎热，必需挥发大量的汗来带走身体多余的热量，这样尿当然就会少了。冬天呢，汗只出几百毫升（因为多出汗，人就要发冷了），这样体内的水分就只能走小便这条路了。算起来，还是“收支”平衡的。　（木风）
