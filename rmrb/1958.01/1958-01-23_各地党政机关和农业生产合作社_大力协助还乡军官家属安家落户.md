Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. Party and government organs and agricultural production cooperatives in various localities are vigorously assisting returning military officers' families in employment, settling down, and participating in the construction of a new socialist countryside.

    Soon after the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued instructions on mobilizing military dependents to return to their hometowns for production and participate in socialist construction, local governments and agricultural cooperatives enthusiastically launched activities to welcome military dependents back to the production front and help them solve various difficulties in production and life. The cotton cloth sales offices of the People's Committees of Guangdong, Fujian, Hubei, Henan, and other provinces helped military dependents whose homes were in cold regions to properly solve the problem of purchasing cotton clothing and quilts upon returning home. The Beijing Municipal People's Committee specifically established a "Reception Office for Military Dependents Returning Home" to assist military dependents in settling down in Beijing. In order to properly settle the military dependents who returned to their hometowns for production, the Secretary of the Shouguang County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shandong Province personally convened a meeting of representatives of various agricultural cooperatives to make specific arrangements, including assigning special personnel to do the reception work for the military dependents who returned home, such as preparing housing, allocating grain, arranging admission procedures to the cooperative and production labor posts, arranging for military officers' children to attend school, etc., so that many military dependents felt the warmth of being in a large labor family as soon as they set foot on their homeland. The head of Xinmin County, Liaoning Province, personally led Baiqibao, Gaotaizi, and other districts to prepare housing, grain, and firewood for 550 households, waiting for military dependents to return home and settle down.
    Many military dependents were properly settled in life as soon as they arrived home. Many township and cooperative cadres personally helped them register their household registration, handle grain purchase procedures, repair kangs, and clean up houses. When Xing Yilian, a platoon leader of a certain unit stationed on Hainan Island, sent his family to Jiaotang Village, Fengping Township, Wenchang County, to settle down, the agricultural cooperative solved his family's eating problem as soon as he entered the village. The next day, the secretary of the Fengping Township branch of the Communist Party of China told him that the house was ready. Then the agricultural cooperative allocated furniture. Some commune members also took the initiative to send him many sweet potatoes, charcoal, dung baskets, bamboo poles for drying clothes, and a cage of ducklings. On the second day after the wife of Mou Junqing, a captain in a certain unit stationed in Nanjing, arrived home, the cooperative sent her 850 jin of grain, including millet, corn, and peanuts, and a lot of firewood, which had been prepared for her long ago. When Zeng Taozhen, the wife of Zheng Yi, a captain stationed in Fuzhou, returned to her hometown, Hounan Township, Dabu County, Guangdong Province, the local government immediately sent people to help her rent a house and settle down, and the landlady took the initiative to lend her a full set of furniture such as beds, tables, chairs, and cabinets. The issue of school enrollment for military officers' children after returning home was also resolved very promptly in various places. The two older children of Captain Wang Huichuan, who were originally studying in a primary school in Shenyang, were admitted to the local primary school the day after they returned to their hometown of Leting County, Hebei Province. Zhao Hongqing, a military officer's family member, received a notice from the village primary school on the afternoon of the day she returned to her hometown of Laiyang, Shandong, that her children could enroll at any time.
    Local governments and agricultural cooperatives attach great importance to the employment of military dependents after returning home. The vast majority of military dependents have been absorbed as members by local agricultural cooperatives after arriving home and have been placed in appropriate labor positions. As soon as Liu Fenglan, a military officer's family member, arrived home, she was assigned to be the leader of the women's production team by the agricultural cooperative. Dong Xiuzhi, a military officer's family member, became the village's women's director not long after returning home, and was also responsible for the village's people's school. Miao Chengping's wife, a military officer's family member, was elected as the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch because of her good labor performance after returning home. In addition, many military officers' families have been assigned to work as accountants and teachers in people's schools in agricultural cooperatives after returning home. Some have also been assigned to study agricultural technology so that they can serve as agricultural technicians in the future. At present, many military dependents who have returned to their hometowns have made great achievements in the winter production movement such as repairing water conservancy projects and accumulating manure. Many people have become labor experts and have been praised by the people.

    各地党政机关和农业生产合作社
    大力协助还乡军官家属安家落户
    新华社22日讯　全国各地党政机关和农业生产合作社大力协助还乡军官家属劳动就业，安家落户，参加社会主义新农村的建设。
    早在中国人民解放军总政治部发布关于动员随军家属还乡生产、参加社会主义建设的指示之后不久，各地政府和农业社就热情地展开了欢迎军官家属重回生产战线，帮助还乡军官家属解决生产和生活上的各种困难的活动。广东、福建、湖北、河南等省人民委员会棉布统销办公室，帮助家在寒冷地区的军官家属适当解决了回乡添置棉衣和棉絮的问题。北京市人民委员会为协助军官家属来京安家，专门成立了“接待军官家属还乡办公室”。山东省寿光县为了妥善安置回乡生产的随军家属，中共县委书记亲自召集各农业社代表开会作了具体的安排，包括指定专人做还乡军官家属接待工作，如准备住房，拨给粮食，安排入社手续和生产劳动岗位，安排军官子女入学等等，使许多军官家属一踏上家乡的土地就感到置身于劳动大家庭中的亲切和温暖。辽宁省新民县县长亲自领导白旗堡、高台子等区准备了五百五十户人家的住房、粮食和烧柴，等候军官家属还乡定居。
    许多随军家属一到家，首先在生活上得到了妥善的安置。不少乡、社干部亲自帮助他们登记户口、办理购粮手续和修炕、收拾屋子。海南岛驻军某部排长邢贻廉送家属到文昌县冯平乡蛟塘村安家时，一进村，农业社就为他家解决了吃饭问题。第二天，中共冯平乡支部书记就告诉他说房子已经准备好了。接着农业社又给拨来了家具。有些社员还主动送给他许多地瓜、木炭、粪箕、晒衣服的竹竿和一笼小鸭。南京驻军某部上尉牟俊卿的爱人到家的第二天，社里就把早已为她准备好的谷子、玉米和花生等口粮八百五十斤和许多烧柴送上门来。福州驻军上尉郑义的妻子曾桃珍回到故乡广东省大埔侯南乡时，当地政府立即派人帮她租房定居，房东大娘还主动地把床、桌、椅、柜等全套家具借给她使用。对于军官子女回乡后的入学问题，各地也都解决得十分及时。上尉王惠川的两个大孩子原在沈阳小学念书，回到河北乐亭县故乡后，第二天就被当地小学接纳入学了。军官家属赵洪卿在回到山东莱阳家乡的当天下午，就接到村小学的通知，她的孩子随时可以入学。
    各地政府和农业社对于军官家属还乡后的劳动就业问题，更是十分重视。绝大部分军官家属到家后都被当地农业社吸收为社员，被安置在适当的劳动岗位上。军官家属刘凤兰一到家就被农业社分配做妇女生产队的队长。军官家属董秀芝回家不久就担任了村的妇女主任，还负责村里的民校工作。军官苗成平的爱人回乡后由于劳动表现好，还当选为共青团支部书记。此外，也有不少军官家属回乡后被安置在农业社里作会计，作民校教员。有的还被分配去学习农业技术，以便将来充当农业技术员。目前，许多回到家乡的军官家属已经在修水利、积肥等冬季大生产运动中取得了很大的成绩，不少人成了劳动能手，受到人民群众的赞扬。
