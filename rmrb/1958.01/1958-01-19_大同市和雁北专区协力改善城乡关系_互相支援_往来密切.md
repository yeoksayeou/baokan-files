    Datong City and Yanbei Special District Join Forces to Improve Urban-Rural Relations
    Mutual Support, Close Cooperation
    (Our dispatch) Since the past six months or so, various departments in Datong City, Shanxi Province, and Yanbei Special District have adopted various measures to improve urban-rural relations, making the relationship between Datong City and the surrounding rural areas even closer.
    The broad masses of workers and staff in Datong City's industrial, handicraft, and commercial departments, under the slogan of "Actively serving Yanbei's agricultural production and people's needs," have produced and supplied a large number of industrial products to Yanbei farmers. Datong City's machinery and iron factories have repaired and fitted more than five tons of tractor and various agricultural machinery parts for various counties in Yanbei. They have repaired 11 lathes and 7 sluice gate opening and closing machines, and manufactured 2 horizontal double-core boilers and a large number of water pipes, bending shafts, and other materials. Various factories have also sent mechanical repair workers to counties such as Zuoyun and Hunyuan in Yanbei to promptly repair two boiler camel machines, three water pumps, and other machinery and tools. The original proportion of goods such as manpower carts and horse-drawn cart parts allocated by the commercial departments was: Datong City accounted for 70% and Yanbei accounted for 30%. Now, according to the urgent needs of the rural areas, it has been adjusted to 60% for Yanbei and 40% for Datong City.
    The workers and staff of the industrial and handicraft departments in Datong City have also actively improved product quality and reduced costs to support agricultural production. For example, the iron shovels of the Iron Industry Cooperative have been welcomed by agricultural cooperatives in various counties after their quality was improved, and the shovels have changed from being overstocked to being in short supply. In July last year, the prices of 24 products, such as flanges and large and small flower nuts for Datong City's horse-drawn cart accessories, were reduced by an average of 29.89%.
    The broad masses of farmers and the leading organs of the special district and counties in the Yanbei area have also responded to Datong City's support with practical actions. Within five months after the urban-rural conference, the counties in Yanbei supplied Datong City's egg factory with 2,628,000 jin of fresh eggs, exceeding the allocation plan by 1.1%. The Yanbei Special Office designated the three key pig-producing counties of Daren, Yanggao, and Tianzhen as Datong City's pig production bases. The tight supply of pork in Datong City has gradually eased. Each person can now eat five ounces to half a catty of pork per month. In addition, various parts of Yanbei have also supplied Datong City with a large number of beef cattle, mutton sheep, and a large number of vegetables, fresh fruits, potato flour, medicinal materials, etc., which has greatly improved the supply of non-staple foods in Datong City.
    In the past few months, various types of urban-rural liaison meetings have been held in the Yanbei area and Datong City, such as urban-rural economic liaison meetings, commercial department liaison meetings, and professional symposiums held by specialized companies and supply and marketing cooperatives. Through these meetings, many important issues such as the allocation of goods between urban and rural areas, inter-regional procurement, and the adjustment of overstocked commodities were resolved, promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.
    The people of various counties in the Yanbei area and Datong City have also visited each other.

    大同市和雁北专区协力改善城乡关系
    互相支援　往来密切
    本报讯　山西省大同市和雁北专区各部门最近半年多以来，采取名种措施改善城乡关系，使大同市和周围农村之间的关系更加密切。
    大同市的工业、手工业和商业部门的广大职工，在“积极为雁北农业生产和人民需要服务”的口号下，为雁北农民生产和供应了大批工业品。大同市的机器、铁工各厂为雁北各县修配了拖拉机和各种农业机械零件有五吨多，修配了十一部车床和七部水闸起闭机，制造了两部卧式双心锅炉和大批的水管、弯轴等器材。各厂还抽出机械修理工深入雁北左云、浑源等县及时修好了两台锅驼机、三部水泵及其它机械和工具。商业部门原来分配人力平车和马车零件等商品的比例是：大同市占70％、雁北占30％，现在已经根据农村的迫切需要，调整为雁北占60％、大同市占40％。
    大同市的工业和手工业部门的职工还积极提高产品质量、降低成本，来支援农业生产。如铁业社的铁锹提高质量以后，受到各县农业社的欢迎，铁锹由积压变成了脱销。去年7月，大同市马车配件法兰、大小花母等二十四种产品的价格，平均下降了29.89％。
    雁北地区的广大农民和专区、县领导机关也以实际行动来答谢大同市的支援。在城乡会议后的五个月内，雁北各县供应了大同市蛋厂二百六十二万八千斤鲜蛋，超过调拨计划的1.1％。雁北专署把大仁、阳高、天镇三个重点产猪县，划作大同市的生猪生产基地。现在大同市猪肉供应紧张情况已逐渐缓和。每人每月已可吃到五两到半斤猪肉。此外，雁北各地还向大同市供应了大量的菜牛、菜羊和大批的蔬菜、鲜果、土豆粉、药材等，使得大同市的副食品供应状况有很大改善。
    几个月来，雁北地区和大同市举行了各种类型的城乡联系会议，如城乡经济联系会议、商业部门的联系会议以及专业公司、供销社召开的专业座谈会议等。通过这些会议着重解决了城乡间货源分配、跨区进货、调剂积压商品等许多重要问题，促进了城乡物资交流。
    大同市和雁北地区各县的人民还互相进行了访问。
