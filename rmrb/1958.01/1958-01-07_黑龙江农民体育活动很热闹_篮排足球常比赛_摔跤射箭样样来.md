(Our Report) With the great development of agricultural production, rural sports in Heilongjiang Province have taken on a new look in the past two years.

Currently, 179 sports associations have been established in rural areas throughout the province, with 10,387 members, changing the spontaneous phenomenon of unorganized rural sports in the past. With the establishment of sports associations and the work of sports activists, sports activities have seen new development. According to incomplete statistics from sixteen cities (suburban districts) and counties, 53 county-level basketball, soccer, volleyball, and track and field games have been held in the past two years, with 20,432 participants; township and commune-level sports meets reached 1,710 times, with 182,268 participants. Various sports teams have also developed; there are currently 4,250 men's and women's basketball teams, with 38,718 players; 386 men's and women's volleyball teams, with 3,584 players; and 167 soccer teams, with 2,602 players. According to statistics from Suihua County alone, the number of young people participating in activities in 1957 increased from 4,000 in 1955 to 14,498. In particular, after the launch of the "Good Health Cup" track and field correspondence competition in rural areas throughout the province in 1957, young people in various places signed up to participate in training. According to incomplete statistics, 45,000 people participated in the competition. This activity aroused a surge of enthusiasm among rural youth to participate in exercise.

In addition, national-style sports activities have also been greatly developed in rural areas. Shangzhi, Ning'an, Wuchang, and the Dorbod Mongolian Autonomous County regularly carry out wrestling, springboard, swing, horse riding, archery, hunting, kicking Ulan Hong, and Bulu activities and competitions.

The development of rural sports has played a significant role in enlivening rural cultural life and promoting production. Sports have become a powerful tool for carrying out communist education among young people. In Shuishiying Township, Qiqihar City, some elderly people used to have objections to young people participating in sports activities, believing that "jumping around doesn't lead to good learning, it wastes shoes, socks, and coats." However, after the Communist Youth League branch organized sports activities, many young people changed some improper habits because of these activities. Elderly people not only no longer object to young people participating in activities but also strongly support them, and some elderly people also participate in voluntary labor to build sports fields alongside the young people.

    黑龙江农民体育活动很热闹
    篮排足球常比赛　摔跤射箭样样来
    本报讯　随着农业生产的大发展，两年来黑龙江省农村体育出现了崭新的面貌。
    目前全省农村共建立了一百七十九个体育协会，发展了一万零三百八十七名会员，改变了过去农村体育无人组织的自发现象。随着体协的建立，体育积极分子的工作，体育活动有了新的发展，据十六个市（郊区）县不完全统计，两年来举行了县一级篮、足、排、田径运动会五十三次，有二万零四百三十二人次参加比赛；乡社级运动会达一千七百一十次，有十八万二千二百六十八人次参加竞赛。各项运动队也有发展；现有男女篮球队四千二百五十个，队员三万八千七百一十八人；男女排球队三百八十六个，队员三千五百八十四人；足球队一百六十七个，队员二千六百零二人。仅就绥化县统计，1957年全县参加活动的青年，即由1955年的四千人增加到一万四千四百九十八人。特别是1957年在全省农村开展“身体好杯”田径通讯比赛以后，各地青年纷纷报名参加锻炼。据不完全统计，参加比赛的有四万五千人。这项活动激起了农村青年参加锻炼的热潮。
    此外，民族形式体育运动在农村也有很大的开展。尚志、宁安、五常、杜尔伯特蒙古族自治县经常开展摔跤、跳板、秋千、骑马、射箭、狩猎、踢乌兰红、布鲁等活动和竞赛。
    农村体育的发展，对活跃农村文化生活，搞好生产起了很大作用。体育已经成为向青年群众进行共产主义教育的有力工具。齐齐哈尔市水师营乡过去一些老年人对青年参加体育活动有意见，认为“蹦蹦跳跳不学好费鞋、费袜子又费袄”。但是经过团支部组织体育活动后，很多青年因为有了体育活动，而改变了一些不正当的习气。老年人不仅不再反对青年人参加活动，而且大力支持，有的老年人也和小伙子一道参加了修建运动场的义务劳动。（白山、一凡）
