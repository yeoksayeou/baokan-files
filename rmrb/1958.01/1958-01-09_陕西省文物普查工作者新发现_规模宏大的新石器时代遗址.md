Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 8th: Cultural relics survey workers in Shaanxi Province recently discovered a large-scale Neolithic site at the junction of Xianyang and Xingping counties. This site covers an area of approximately 1.5 million square meters, more than 30 times larger than a contemporary site discovered in Banpo Village near Xi'an in 1952. Observations of the cross-section reveal that the cultural layers of this site are even thicker than those of the Banpo Village site, with up to three layers, over ten feet thick, containing a wealth of cultural relics. The cultural relics that have been collected here include colored pottery shards, stone axes, bone cones, pottery jars, and decorative stone hairpins, bone hairpins, pottery rings, etc., as well as jade axes and exquisite, small black stone chisels, black stone adzes, etc., which have not been found at the Banpo Village site.

In addition, a farmer in Xianyang County donated a small stone-carved duck, with a head only half the size of a mung bean, but the duck's nose, eyes, and mouth are carved very clearly. According to archaeologists, this is a handicraft from the Han Dynasty, more than two thousand years ago. A Western Zhou Dynasty bronze tripod cauldron inscribed with more than one hundred inscriptions, an iron plow from the Wang Mang period of the Han Dynasty, and a Western Zhou pottery *li* cauldron (a type of ancient cooking pot) that is rare nationwide, with a height and diameter of approximately 40 centimeters each, were also discovered in Chang'an and other places. Some of the discovered tombs also contain beautiful murals. The images of four figures dancing gracefully on a mural in a Tang Dynasty tomb are still intact, with very bright colors.

These sites and cultural relics were discovered by cultural relics survey workers from Chang'an, Xianyang, and Xingping counties in Shaanxi Province during a survey conducted in these three counties from late October to early December 1957. In just over a month, they discovered more than one hundred sites from the Neolithic period and the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties, and the masses donated and collected more than one thousand cultural relics.

    陕西省文物普查工作者新发现
    规模宏大的新石器时代遗址
    新华社西安8日电　陕西省的文物普查工作者最近在咸阳和兴平两县交界的地方发现一处规模宏大的新石器时代遗址。这个遗址面积约有一百五十万平方公尺，比1952年在西安附近半坡村发现的一处同时代遗址大三十多倍。从断面观察，这个遗址的文化层比半坡村遗址还厚，最多的有三层，一丈多厚，蕴藏的文物也很丰富。文物工作者已经在这里采集到的文物除彩色陶片、石斧、骨锥、陶罐和作装饰用的石簪、骨簪、陶环等外，还有在半坡村遗址中没有发现过的玉斧和精致而小巧的黑石?、黑石凿等。
    另外，咸阳县的一位农民捐赠了一只石刻小鸭子，鸭子的头只有半粒绿豆大，但是鸭子的鼻子、眼睛和嘴都刻得十分清楚。据考古人员谈，这是距今二千多年前汉代的工艺品。长安等地还发现了一个刻有一百多个铭文的西周铜?、汉代王莽时期的铁犁和全国少有的高和直径各约四十公分的西周陶鬲。在发现的墓葬中有些还藏有美丽的壁画。一座唐代墓葬的壁画上四个正在翩翩起舞的人物形象还很完整，色彩十分鲜艳。
    这些遗址和文物是陕西省长安、咸阳和兴平等县的文物普查工作人员在1957年10月下旬到12月上旬在这三个县进行普查时发现的。他们在一个多月中发现了新石器时代和周、秦、汉、唐等朝代的遗址一百多处，群众捐赠和采集到的文物一千多件。
