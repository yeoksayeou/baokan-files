Xinhua News Agency, 4th January. The Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Burmese Embassy in China, U Ba Maw, held a grand reception tonight to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Burmese independence. Vice Chairman Zhu De was invited to attend and delivered a speech.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said that the recent struggles of Syria and Indonesia to safeguard national independence and sovereignty, as well as the major achievements of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, once again prove that all attempts to obstruct the independence and autonomy of the Asian and African people are futile.

Vice Chairman Zhu De extended warm congratulations to the Burmese government and people on behalf of the Chinese government and people at the reception. In his speech, he said: "Burma was one of the first countries in Asia and Africa to gain independence after World War II. In the ten years since then, hundreds of millions of Asian and African people have successively broken free from the shackles of colonialism and embarked on the road of independent development. At present, the anti-colonialist struggle of the Asian and African people is continuing to surge forward."

Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out that since its establishment, the Union of Burma has been an important factor in maintaining peace in Asia and the world. Burma has made important contributions to promoting the Indochina armistice, convening the Bandung Conference, participating in advocating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and easing tensions in Asia and the world.

Vice Chairman Zhu emphasized that the profound friendship between China and Burma is of great significance to the peaceful construction of the two countries and to peace and security in Asia. The Sino-Burmese friendship, built on a solid foundation, has broad prospects for development.

At the beginning of the reception, Chargé d'affaires ad interim U Ba Maw delivered a speech, thanking the Chinese and foreign guests who attended the reception. He said that Burma and China had jointly advocated the historic Five Principles, and now no less than eighty countries have accepted these principles of peaceful coexistence, and the area influenced by these principles is growing. When U Ba Maw spoke about the friendly relationship between China and Burma, which is like that of relatives, he said: "This relationship is closer than ever before. As mutual visits between leaders and people at all levels of the two countries become more frequent and increase, the existing close understanding will be greatly enhanced and will be built on a more solid foundation." In his speech, U Ba Maw also talked about the progress and achievements Burma has made in overcoming various difficulties since its independence.

Invited to attend tonight's reception were Vice Chairmen Li Jishen and Huang Yanpei, Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Ye Jianying, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association Zheng Zhenduo, as well as heads of various departments of our government, democratic parties, and people's organizations, and well-known figures from all walks of life in the capital.

Ambassadors of various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th January. Premier Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein of the Union of Burma and his wife, who are currently on a friendly visit to our country, on the 4th, congratulating them on the tenth anniversary of Burmese independence. The text of the telegram is as follows: To His Excellency U Kyaw Nyein, Deputy Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, and Madam:

On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the independence of the Union of Burma, please accept my warm congratulations to you. I sincerely wish the Union of Burma prosperity and the Burmese people happiness. May the Pauk-Phaw friendship between the people of China and Burma be like mountains and rivers connected, pine and cypress evergreen, and become increasingly consolidated and developed. I wish Your Excellency and Madam good health.

Zhou Enlai
Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China

    周总理向吴觉迎副总理电贺独立佳节
    新华社4日讯　缅甸驻中国大使馆临时代办吴巴茂今晚举行盛大招待会，庆祝缅甸独立十周年。朱德副主席应邀出席并讲了话。
    朱德副主席说，最近叙利亚和印度尼西亚维护民族独立和主权的斗争以及亚非团结大会的重大成就再一次证明，一切阻挠亚非人民的独立自主的企图是徒劳无功的。
    朱德副主席在招待会上代表中国政府和人民向缅甸政府和人民致以热烈的祝贺。他在讲话中说：“缅甸是第二次大战以后亚非两洲最早独立的国家之一。在以后的十年间，数以亿计的亚非人民相继摆脱了殖民主义的枷锁，走上独立发展的大道。目前亚非人民反殖民主义的斗争浪潮正在汹涌澎湃地继续高涨。”
    朱副主席指出，缅甸联邦自成立以来就是维护亚洲和世界和平的重要因素。缅甸对于促进印度支那停战、召开万隆会议、参与倡导和平共处五项原则以及缓和亚洲和世界紧张局势，都曾作出重要贡献。
    朱副主席强调说，中缅两国的深厚友谊对于两国的和平建设事业以及亚洲的和平与安全具有重大的意义。建立在巩固基础上的中缅友谊有着广阔的发展前途。
    在招待会开始的时候，吴巴茂临时代办首先致词，向出席招待会的中外客人致谢。他说，缅甸曾经和中国一起倡导了历史性的五项原则，现在不少于八十个国家已经接受了这些和平共处的原则，并且这些原则所影响的地区还在日益增大。吴巴茂在讲到中缅两国亲戚般的友好关系时说：“这种关系比过去更加紧密了。随着两国各级领导人和人民之间相互访问的频繁和增多，目前存在的这种亲密的了解将大大地增强，并将建筑在更巩固的基础上。”吴巴茂在讲话中还谈到了缅甸独立后在克服各种困难中所取得的进步和成就。
    应邀出席今晚招待会的，有李济深、黄炎培副委员长，陈毅、李先念副总理，国防委员会副主席叶剑英，外交部副部长张闻天，中缅友好协会会长郑振铎，以及我国政府各部门、各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人和首都各界著名人士。
    各国驻华大使也应邀出席了招待会。

    当着缅甸联邦独立十周年的时候，请接受我向你们的热烈祝贺。我衷心地祝贺缅甸联邦繁荣和缅甸人民幸福。祝中缅两国人民胞波的友谊像山水相连、松柏长青，日益巩固和发展。祝阁下和夫人身体健康。
