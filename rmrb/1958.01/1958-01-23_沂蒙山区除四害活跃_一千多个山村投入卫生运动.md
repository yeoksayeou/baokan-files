    Active Pest Elimination in the Yimeng Mountain Area
    Over a Thousand Villages Participate in Sanitation Campaign
    (Our Shandong dispatch, 22nd) The patriotic sanitation campaign of "Three Cleans" (clean indoors, clean courtyards, clean streets) and pest elimination in Mengyin County, a revolutionary old base area in the Yimeng Mountain area of Shandong Province, has been launched vigorously in over a thousand villages. Starting from January 9th, a high tide of the "fertilizer accumulation and sanitation campaign blitz month" has been launched throughout the county.
    Last year, thirty-six villages in the county basically achieved the "Three Cleans," and one village was basically rat-free. During the sanitation campaign, the county accumulated over 86,100 more cartloads of soil fertilizer.
    At the beginning of this year, the county's Patriotic Sanitation Campaign Committee required the entire county to carry out an unprecedented fertilizer accumulation and sanitation campaign blitz month, combining concentrated effort with regular work, from the county level down to the villages. The goal is to achieve the fighting target of becoming a basically "Two-Free" county (free of flies and mosquitoes) this year and a "Three Cleans, Four-Free" county next year.
    On the 9th, over 500 cadres from the county's directly affiliated organizations and cadres from districts, townships, and communes attending the four-level cadre conference in the county participated in a large-scale clean-up. According to statistics, 147 villages in the county have now basically achieved the "Three Cleans" and have implemented unified management of manure. In Guanzhuang District, all forty agricultural production cooperatives have implemented unified management of manure. (Liu Yannian)

    沂蒙山区除四害活跃
    一千多个山村投入卫生运动
    本报山东22日电　革命老根据地山东沂蒙山区的蒙阴县三洁（室内洁、院落洁、街道洁）、除四害爱国卫生运动，已经轰轰烈烈地在一千多个山村中展开。从1月9日起，在全县范围里掀起了积肥、卫生运动突击月高潮。
    全县去年基本达到三洁的村有三十六个，基本无鼠村一个。在卫生运动中，全县增积土肥八万六千一百多车。
    今年年初，该县爱国卫生运动委员会要求全县在突击与常年相结合的方针下，从县到村开展一个规模空前的积肥、卫生运动突击月，争取提前实现今年成为基本二无县（无蝇无蚊）、明年成为三洁四无县的奋斗目标。
    9日，该县直属机关五百多名干部和正在县参加四级干部大会的区、乡、社干部都参加了大扫除。据统计，目前该县已有一百四十七个村基本达到了三洁，实行了粪便统一管理，官庄区有四十个农业生产合作社全部实行了粪便统一管理。　（刘延年）
