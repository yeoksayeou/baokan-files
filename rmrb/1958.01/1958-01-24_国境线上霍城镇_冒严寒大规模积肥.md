Huo Town on the Borderline
Braving the Severe Cold to Accumulate Fertilizer on a Large Scale

(Our dispatch) The peasants in six townships of Huo Town, Huo County, in the western part of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, near the border, have launched a large-scale and unprecedented fertilizer accumulation campaign, braving the severe cold of minus 10 to 20 degrees Celsius. 90% of the young and middle-aged, and elderly people in the six townships participated in this movement. They put forward the slogan of breaking frozen ground, digging out fertilizer, and striving for a bumper harvest this year. In just twenty days, according to incomplete statistics, more than 60,000 carts of fertilizer (equivalent to about 60 million catties) have been accumulated. The head of the county propaganda department and the secretary of the district committee are driving carts to participate in the accumulation of fertilizer. More than 150 young people in the Fourth Township organized a shock team, ran one or twenty miles to dig up more than 8,000 carts of sheep and horse manure. They also broke the past habit of not digging toilets and dug more than 100 carts of fertilizer.
