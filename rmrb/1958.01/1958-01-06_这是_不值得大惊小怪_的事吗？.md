    Is This Something "Not Worth Making a Fuss About"?
    I encountered several workers in the Liaocheng Special District who were returning home to visit their families. They were all talking about the pig raising situation in their homes. Some said that out of seven pigs, only three were left, and if it wasn't stopped, they would all die; others said that all the pigs in their homes had died. I asked them the reason for the pigs' deaths, and they all said they didn't know.
    It is said that in the Luxi Southwest area of Shandong, there was no tradition of raising pigs before. After cooperativization, a pig-raising upsurge was brought about. Last year, almost every agricultural cooperative proposed the slogan of one pig per person. However, after the winter production upsurge centered on water conservancy construction and manure accumulation was launched, many agricultural cooperatives neglected the pig-raising business. For example, in the Jingyanggang Agricultural Cooperative in Shouzhang County, the winter water conservancy movement was in full swing, but more than 800 of the cooperative's 4,000 pigs died after winter began. An official stationed in the cooperative told me that they had only inspected 52 households and 38 pigs had died; the main reason for the pig deaths was that they had not made preparations for feeding and management before winter, and the weather turned cold, and the pigs were frozen in open-air nests, so the pig mortality rate was very high. Some cooperative cadres and stationed cadres only care about water conservancy and agricultural production work, neglecting other sideline occupations. Some cadres even think that this is just a shortcoming in general work and is not worth making a fuss about. I think this understanding is wrong and needs to be corrected quickly.

    这是“不值得大惊小怪”的事吗？
    我在聊城专署遇到几个回家探亲的工人，他们都在谈论着自己家里养猪的情况；有的说，七口猪死剩三口了，如不制止，就要死光；也有的说，他家里的猪死光了。我问他们猪死的原因，他们都说不知道。
    据说，山东鲁西南一带，从前都没有养猪的习惯，合作化以后，带来了养猪高潮，去年差不多每个农业社都提出了一人一头猪的口号。但是，以兴修水利积肥为中心的冬季生产高潮掀起以后，不少农业社就忽视了养猪事业。例如寿张县景阳岗农业社，冬季水利运动是闹得热火朝天，可是，这个社四千多头猪入冬后就死了八百头。一位驻社干部告诉我说，他们仅检查了五十二户，就死了三十八头猪；死猪的原因主要是在入冬前没有做好饲养管理准备工作，天气转寒冷，猪在露天窝里受冻，因此猪的死亡率很大。有些社干部和驻社干部，只顾搞水利农田生产工作，忽视其它副业，甚至有些干部认为这只是一般工作中的缺点，用不着大惊小怪，我认为这种认识是错误的，需要赶快纠正。
