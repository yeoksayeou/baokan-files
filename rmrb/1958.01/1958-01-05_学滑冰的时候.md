    Learning to skate is not difficult. If you practice for one or two hours each time, you can generally grasp the basic techniques of skating in just three to five sessions. The biggest fear for beginners is falling. Of course, we should try to avoid falling, but the process of almost falling and maintaining balance is a necessary part of learning to skate.
    When first learning to skate, you should first learn to stand firmly on the ice and maintain the correct posture. Then learn to push off and move forward with your feet together, and then learn to glide on one foot after pushing off. After that, practice stopping and turning.
    The correct standing posture on the ice is: heels facing each other, toes pointing outwards at approximately sixty degrees; the center of gravity of the body is on the middle of the skate blade; both skate blades should be upright on the ice or tilted slightly inward; the upper body should lean forward, and the arms should be naturally placed on both sides of the body; the knees should be slightly bent, and the ankle joints should also be bent. This can lower the body's center of gravity and make it easier to maintain balance.
    When starting to glide, shift most of your weight smoothly to the foot that is gliding forward, so that the other foot can be used to push off. Pushing off is the main driving force for gliding. The correct way to push off is to use the inside edge of the blade to push off diagonally backward, while shifting the body's center of gravity to the gliding foot in a timely manner. After pushing off, the pushing foot should be retracted immediately. Keep both feet parallel, allowing them to naturally move forward together. At this time, the body's center of gravity should be lowered as much as possible (bending the waist, leaning the body forward), the hands should swing naturally, the ankle should be very stable so that the skate blade is upright on the ice, and the eyes should focus on a point five or six meters ahead in order to maintain balance and glide forward.
    When first learning to skate, avoid pushing off backward in the direction of travel. This will result in no support point, making it impossible to push off and move forward, and making it easy to fall.
    After practicing pushing off and gliding with your feet together many times, it will be easier to learn to glide on one foot and turn.
    There are many ways to stop, and the easier one is the turning method. While gliding, turn the front foot inward in a small arc, and lean the body's center of gravity slightly forward. The rear foot also uses the inside edge to press on the ice. At this time, the body will rotate, forming a posture with the toes pointing outward and the heels pointing inward. Then, retract both feet and bring the heels together to stop.
    When learning to skate, it is inevitable to fall. When beginners are about to lose their balance, they often tend to straighten up their bodies to try to support themselves, which can actually cause them to fall harder and even get injured. When the body is about to lose balance, lower the center of gravity immediately, bend the knees, and extend the arms to the left and right to adjust the body's balance. If you really can't maintain it, try to squat down, lean forward, and land on the ice with your upper arm and back, and do not use your hands to support yourself to avoid breaking bones.

    学滑冰的时候
    马巽
    学会滑冰并不难。如果每次学一、二小时，一般只需要三、五次就可以初步掌握滑冰的技术了。初学滑冰的人，最怕的是?跤。当然我们应该尽量避免?倒，但就是在身体将要?倒而能够维持住平衡的时候，也正是学会滑冰必需经过的一个过程。
    刚学滑冰的时候，应该是先学会在冰上站稳，使姿势正确。然后再学习蹬冰和并足前进，再学习蹬冰后单足滑行。然后再练习停止和拐弯的动作。
    在冰上正确的站立姿势是：两足跟相对，足尖向外约六十度；身体重心放在冰刀的中部；两支冰刀都应直立在冰面上或稍稍向内倾倒；上身向前倾，两臂自然放在身体两侧；两膝微曲，踝关节也要弯曲。这样可以使身体重心降低，容易维持平衡。
    在开始滑行时，将身体大部分重量很平稳的移到向前滑行的那只脚上，使另一足用来蹬冰。蹬冰是滑行的主要推动力量，正确的蹬冰方法是用刀的内刃向侧后方蹬冰，同时将身体的重心及时的移到滑行足上去。蹬冰足在蹬冰之后应立刻收回。两足平行，使其自然的并足向前滑进。这时身体重心应尽量降低（弯腰、身体向前倾），两手自然摆动，踝部要很稳定地使冰刀直立在冰面上，眼睛注视前面五、六公尺地方，以便维持平衡向前滑行。
    初学滑冰时，切忌顺着滑行方向向后蹬冰。这样就会没有支撑点，蹬不住冰，无法向前滑行，而且容易?倒。
    通过多次练习蹬冰并足滑行后，再学单足滑行和拐弯就比较容易了。
    停止的方法有很多种，比较容易的是转体法。在滑行中，前足用内刃拐小弯，身体重心稍向前倾，后足也用内刃压冰。这时身体便旋转，形成两足尖向外，脚跟向内的姿势。这时收回双足，使足跟相抵，便可停止。
    学滑冰，难免不?跤。初学者在身体将要失去平衡时，往往习惯于挺起身子来勉强支持，这样反而?的更重，甚至受伤。当身体将要失去平衡时，应立即降低重心，膝部弯屈，两臂左右伸开，以便于调节身体的平衡。如果实在维持不住的时候，应该尽量使身体下蹲，向前倾倒，用后臂和背部着冰，不要用手去支撑，以免折伤骨头。
