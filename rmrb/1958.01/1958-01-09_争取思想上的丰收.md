    Striving for a Bumper Harvest in Thought
    More than two months ago, in response to the call of the Party and the country, and with the approval of the organization, I went down to the outskirts of Beijing to participate in agricultural production.

    For more than two months, thanks to my active participation in labor production, my body is much stronger than before, and my thoughts and feelings have begun to change. I have come to realize that the farmers are diligent in labor production and very frugal in life. In the past, I felt uncomfortable queuing up to buy meat. If the house was small or broken, I didn't want to live in it. If the clothes were old and worn, I didn't want to wear them. If the heating wasn't warm enough, I was very unhappy. Although these are all small things, they all show how different my thoughts and feelings are from those of the working people. In 1958, I must not only become a peasant in appearance, but also transform my own thoughts and feelings.

    In more than two months of labor production, I have also deeply realized that the farmers care for and take care of us in every way: they teach us the farm work we don't know how to do, let us rest when we are tired from work, let us carry half a basket if we can't lift a full basket of cabbage, and even give us their meat coupons to buy meat. I feel that these things all show that the farmers warmly welcome us intellectuals and are willing to make friends with us intellectuals. In the past two months, I have done some mass work and made some farmer friends. In the future, I will strive to do more mass work. In addition to continuing to participate in literacy work, I will regularly read newspapers to the masses and publicize the Party's various policies. At the same time, I will learn the farmers' excellent ideological style better by making more farmer friends.

    Through contacts with the farmers in production and life, I have also unconsciously strengthened my feeling of always thinking of the farmers, which I did not have in the past or was very lacking. I feel that this shows that I have made a good start in transforming my own thoughts and feelings. I am willing to seize every opportunity to actively participate in labor in the future, so that 1958 will be a year of bumper harvest in my ideological transformation.

### 争取思想上的丰收

    争取思想上的丰收
    两个多月以前，我响应党和国家的号召，经组织批准下放到京郊参加农业生产。
    两个多月以来，由于我积极地参加了劳动生产，我的身体比过去强多了，我的思想感情已经开始在起变化。我已经认识到，农民们在劳动生产上是勤劳的，在生活上是非常俭朴的。过去，我对于排队买肉感到不舒服，房子小了破了，就不愿意住，衣服破旧了，就不愿意穿；暖气不暖，就很不高兴。这些虽然都是小事，但这些小事都说明我的思想感情和劳动人民有着多大的不同。在1958年内，我不仅要作到在外表上农民化，而且也要改造自己的思想感情。
    在两个多月的劳动生产中，我还深刻地体会到，农民是处处关怀和照顾我们的：遇有不会的农活就教给我们，劳动累了就让我们休息，抬不动一筐白菜就让我们抬半筐，甚至把自己的肉票让给我们去买肉。我觉得，这些事情都说明，农民是热诚地欢迎我们知识分子的，是愿意和我们知识分子交朋友的。在过去的两个多月中，我已经作了一些群众工作，也交了一些农民朋友。今后我要争取多作一些群众工作，除了继续参加扫盲工作以外，要作到经常为群众读报，宣传党的各项政策；同时还要通过多交农民朋友，更好地学习农民的优良的思想作风。
    在通过生产和生活等方面同农民的交往中，我还不知不觉地加强了处处为农民着想的感情，这是过去没有的或者很缺乏的。我觉得，这说明我在改造自己的思想感情上，已经有了一个良好的开端，我愿意在今后抓紧一切机会积极参加劳动，使1958年成为我在思想改造上丰收的一年。
