Good News from Beyond Shanhaiguan

Liaoning: 1.59 Million Mu of Land Yields Over 400 Jin of Grain Per Mu

Ninety-Nine Communes and Five Farms Have Grain Yields Surpassing the Yellow River

(Our dispatch) According to recent statistics from the agricultural departments of Liaoning Province, in 1957, sixteen townships, three hundred and ninety-six communes, and twenty-eight state-owned farms, totaling one million five hundred and ninety-five thousand mu of land, reached or exceeded the target of 400 jin of grain per mu (Chinese mu) as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program. Among them, ninety-nine communes, five farms, and some townships even reached the yield targets south of the Yellow River, reaching or exceeding 500 jin.

The counties and cities with a relatively large number of units in Liaoning Province reaching the grain production targets stipulated in the Program include Anshan, Shenyang, Liaoyang, Qingyuan, Xinbin, Haicheng, Gaiping, Yingkou, and Anshan City. These counties and cities have fifteen townships, three hundred and twenty-three communes, and one million two hundred and seventy thousand mu of land that have reached or exceeded the Program's targets. Among them, Yingkou County has a total of two hundred and fifty-six communes, and fifty-five communes with over one hundred and sixty-eight thousand mu of land have reached or exceeded the grain production targets stipulated in the Program, accounting for 13.4% of the county's cultivated land area.

After collectivization, these townships and communes largely engaged in large-scale farmland capital construction and vigorously developed farmland irrigation over the past few years, expanding the area of paddy fields. In the water source area of Yingkou County, paddy fields have been basically realized after collectivization, with a yield of 560 jin per mu. The Qianjin Agricultural Commune in Gaijia Township of this county is located in the lower reaches of the Liao River, with low-lying terrain. Before collectivization, more than 1,300 mu of low-lying land were annually flooded, which the masses called "saline-alkali depressions, blind nine years out of ten." Since the realization of advanced collectivization in the winter of 1955, canals have been dug for water diversion, flood prevention and drainage, turning 1,800 mu of low-yielding depressions into high-yielding paddy fields, increasing from over 400 jin per mu in the past to 813 jin in 1956, already "crossing the Huai and Yangtze Rivers." Although the area suffered a major drought for eighty days in 1957, the yield still reached 600 jin per mu after disaster relief efforts.

In dryland crop areas and barren mountainous areas, various agricultural communes have adopted various yield-increasing measures in light of local conditions, and some townships and communes have also reached the Program's targets. The Xi'ai, Xiyao, and Daqian Agricultural Communes in Daiqian Township, Haicheng County, implemented the yield-increasing experience of deep plowing, close planting, and increased fertilization. The three communes had a total of 9,931 mu of cultivated land, with a fertilization area of 87.3% in 1957, an expansion of 15.7% compared to 1956 and 18.9% compared to 1955. The unit fertilization amount increased by half compared to 1956 and 1.4 times compared to 1955, and the area of intercropping was expanded year by year. The grain yield of intercropped corn and potatoes reached 700 jin per mu, an increase of 57% compared to ordinary single-cropped corn. The Hongxing Commune in Chaoyang County, a mountainous area in western Liaoning Province, had 540 mu of grain crops with a yield of 492.2 jin per mu in 1957. In Xiaoyu Township, Shenyang County, in the plains of northern Liaoning Province, 2,700 to 2,800 mu of grain crops achieved a yield of over 400 jin per mu in both 1956 and 1957, reaching the Program's targets for two consecutive years.

Among the ninety state-owned farms in the province, twenty-eight farms with over 61,000 mu of land have also reached or exceeded the Program's targets. Among them, the Demonstration Farm and Gushan Farm in Andong County, the Hunhe Farm in Shenyang City, and the Demonstration Farms in Benxi and Haicheng County achieved a yield of 583 jin per mu. The yield of dryland rice on the Demonstration Farm in Haicheng County reached 700 jin per mu, and sorghum reached 766 jin. The yield of sorghum per mu on the Demonstration Farm in Beizhen County has reached more than 560 jin for two consecutive years. The yield of rice per mu on the Demonstration Farm in Beipiao County reached more than 610 jin in 1957, which is half as high again as the local average yield. (Zhou Hongde, Zhao Zonglai)

    山海关外传喜报
    辽宁一百五十九万亩地亩产粮食四百斤以上
    九十九个社和五个农场粮食产量跨过了黄河
    本报讯　据辽宁省农业部门最近统计，1957年全省已有十六个乡、三百九十六个社和二十八个国营农场，共计一百五十九万五千亩地达到或超过了全国农业发展纲要规定的每亩（市亩）产四百斤粮食的指标。其中九十九个社、五个农场和部分乡并达到了黄河以南的产量指标，达到或超过了五百斤。
    辽宁省达到纲要规定的粮食生产指标的单位较多的，有安东、沈阳、辽阳、清原、新宾、海城、盖平、营口、安东市等九个县市。这些县市有十五个乡、三百二十三个社，一百二十七万亩地达到和超过了纲要指标。其中营口县，共有二百五十六个社，有五十五个社的十六万八千多亩土地达到和超过了纲要规定的粮食生产指标，占全县耕地面积的13.4％。
    这些乡、社，在合作化后大都大量地进行了农田基本建设，几年来大力开发了农田水利，扩大了水田面积。营口县水源区在合作化后，已基本实现了水田化，每亩产量已达到五百六十斤；这个县的盖家乡前进农业社位于辽河下游，地势低洼，合作化前每年都有一千三百多亩洼地内涝成灾，群众称为“盐碱低洼，十年九瞎”。自1955年冬实现高级合作化后，开渠引水，防洪排涝，把一千八百亩低产洼地变成高产水田，由过去每亩四百多斤提高到1956年的八百一十三斤，已经“跨过了淮河长江”。1957年虽遭八十天的大旱，但是经过抗灾斗争，每亩产量仍然达到六百斤。
    在旱地作物地区和土质瘠薄的山区，由于各农业社因地制宜采取了各种增产措施，也同样出现了一些达到了纲要指标的乡、社。海城县代千乡的西艾、西腰和代千农业社，推行了深耕密植多施肥的增产经验，三个社共有九千九百三十一亩耕地，1957年施肥面积达87.3％，比1956年扩大15.7％，比1955年扩大18.9％，单位施肥量比1956年增加半倍，比1955年增加一点四倍，并逐年扩大了套种面积；玉米套土豆每亩产粮达七百斤，比一般单种玉米增产57％。辽宁省西部山区的朝阳县红星社，1957年有五百四十亩粮食作物亩产四百九十二点二斤；在辽北平原地区的沈阳县小于乡，两千七八百亩粮食作物，在1956年和1957年两年内，每亩产量达四百多斤，连续两年都达到了纲要指标。
    在全省九十个国营农场中，有二十八个农场的六万一千多亩土地也达到和超过了纲要指标。其中安东县的示范农场和孤山农场、沈阳市浑河农场、本溪、海城县的示范农场的每亩产量达到五百八十三斤。海城县示范农场旱田稻谷每亩产量达七百斤，高粱达七百六十六斤。北镇县示范农场的高粱每亩产量，连续两年都达到五百六十多斤。北票县示范农场1957年稻谷每亩产量达六百一十多斤，比当地一般产量高半倍。　（周宏德、赵宗来）
