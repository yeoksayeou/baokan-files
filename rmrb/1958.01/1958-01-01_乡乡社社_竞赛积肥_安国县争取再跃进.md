    Villages and Communes Nationwide Compete in Manure Accumulation
    Anguo County Strives for Another Great Leap Forward
    This newspaper reports that Anguo County, Hebei Province, which has already achieved the per-mu yield target for grain crops as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program, plans to increase the per-mu yield of grain crops in 1958 to 550 jin, based on the 438 jin in 1957. To achieve this production increase plan, more than 110,000 laborers in the county have been put into water conservancy construction and manure accumulation campaigns, with the aim of accumulating 5.7 billion jin of fertilizer, averaging 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land. The county will increase the number of pigs raised from the current 96,000 to 130,000, ensuring pigs in every sty and a pig for every sty.
    Before launching the water conservancy and manure accumulation campaign, some cadres and masses had conservative ideas. The county leadership convened a conference of activists in water conservancy and manure accumulation, where 188 advanced communes and teams and 1,369 model cadres and commune members were rewarded. The county also mobilized all villages and communes to conduct extensive airing of views, big debates, and big character posters to summarize experiences.

    乡乡社社　竞赛积肥
    安国县争取再跃进
    本报讯　已经实现全国农业发展纲要规定粮食作物亩产指标的河北省安国县，计划1958年粮食作物亩产量要在1957年四百三十八斤的基础上提高到五百五十斤。为了实现这个增产计划，全县已有十一万多名劳动力投入兴修水利和积肥运动。要求积肥量要达到五十七亿斤，每亩耕地平均施肥一万斤。全县养猪要由现在的九万六千口发展到十三万口，作到有猪有圈，圈圈有猪。
    这县在开展水利积肥运动以前，部分干部和群众有保守思想，县领导机关召开了水利积肥积极分子大会，在会上奖励了一百八十八个先进社、队，一千三百六十九名模范干部和社员。还发动各乡社开展了大鸣大放大争，总结了经验。
