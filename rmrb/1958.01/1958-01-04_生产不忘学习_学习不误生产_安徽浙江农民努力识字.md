Production Does Not Forget Learning, Learning Does Not Delay Production
Anhui and Zhejiang Farmers Strive to Become Literate

    (Our report) Anhui Province has launched a vigorous literacy campaign. By mid-December, more than two million people in the province had participated in people's school studies. The migrant workers participating in the harnessing project of the lower reaches of the Wan River have set off a wave of learning on the construction site. Literacy groups have been established on the construction site, with full-time cadres responsible for literacy work. They will organize 90,000 migrant workers to participate in cultural studies on the construction site within the time frame of harnessing the Wan River. More than 80,000 migrant workers in Lujiang County have begun to study culture. All 2,700 migrant workers of the Shizhi Township in Wuhu County, who are engaged in water conservancy construction, are students of the construction site cultural school. They insert literacy signs on the construction site and paste single characters on carrying poles, shovels, and other tools, learning while working. Members of the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Hefei City bring literacy textbooks and blackboards to the pond. They stipulate that they will study for one hour during the rest time of digging ponds every day. Taihe County has also compiled literacy textbooks that are very popular among farmers in conjunction with the production situation of water conservancy construction.
    The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee plan to organize 4 million people (accounting for 40% of the province's young and middle-aged illiterates) to enter people's schools this year, and strive to eliminate 400,000 illiterates after the autumn harvest this year, laying the foundation for completely eliminating illiteracy within seven to twelve years. More than 120,000 people's school teachers have now been trained throughout the province. Counties such as Dingyuan, Chu County, Binghui, and Funan have overfulfilled the 1957 enrollment task. The Hongqi Cooperative in Fuyang County also held a literacy propaganda week to mobilize cooperative members to enter people's schools. In addition to using slides, big-character posters, loudspeakers, singing teams, and village speeches for propaganda, it also held a "Marching Towards Culture" conference attended by more than 4,000 people. At present, this cooperative is "every team has a people's school, and every household has students."
    In order to further promote the rural literacy movement, Anhui Province also held a literacy mobilization broadcast conference, organizing farmers throughout the province to listen to the mobilization reports made by Gui Linqi, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, and responsible comrades from the Provincial Education Department, Women's Federation, and Communist Youth League. Township and cooperative cadres and outstanding people's school lecturers introduced teaching and school-running experiences. In his report, Comrade Gui Linqi requested that all literate people in the province contribute to literacy work, and that every grassroots cadre and agricultural cooperative member actively participate in learning. In the future, in production competitions, cultural learning should be listed as one of the competition contents, regardless of the unit or individual. (Yu Feng)
    Also reported that according to statistics from 32 counties in Zhejiang including Lanxi, Xiaoshan, Jinyun, Daishan, Haiyan, Songyang, and Hangzhou City, more than 154,300 people have participated in cultural learning.
    Zhejiang Province has initially made a literacy plan. This plan requires that within 1965, more than 5.7 million young and middle-aged illiterates and semi-illiterates in the province be organized to enter school, and 2 million to 3 million farmers should participate in learning every winter. By 1965, 4.4 million illiterates will be eliminated, accounting for 80%, and all illiterates will be eliminated by 1967. Now all counties have also formulated literacy plans. A large number of people's school teachers have been trained in various places. Most of these people's school teachers are township chiefs, primary school principals, and teachers responsible for cultural, educational, and health work, who are responsible for social education work. According to statistics from 42 counties, more than 27,970 people have been trained so far.
    Literacy work in various places is closely integrated with the current central work. People's school teachers in Qu County, Zhuji and other counties bring textbooks, lamp oil, and go to the water conservancy construction site to attend classes. People's school teachers in fishing cooperatives in Putuo, Shengsi, Daishan, Xiangshan and other counties go to sea to produce with the fishermen. They use the gaps in marine production to teach by "using the sea boat as a classroom and hanging the blackboard on the mast."

    生产不忘学习　学习不误生产
    安徽浙江农民努力识字
    本报讯　安徽省已经展开了一个生气蓬勃的扫盲运动。到12月中旬，全省已有二百多万人参加民校学习。参加根治皖河下游工程的民工，在工地上掀起了学习热潮。这里成立了工地扫盲小组，有专职干部负责扫盲工作，他们要在根治皖河的时间内，组织九万个民工参加工地上的文化学习。庐江县已有八万多民工开始学习文化。芜湖县石桅乡兴修水利的二千七百个民工全部都是工地文化学校的学员，他们在工地上插上识字牌，在扁担、铁锹等工具上贴着单字，一面工作一面学习。合肥市星火农业社的社员们把识字课本、黑板带到塘边，他们规定在每天挖塘的休息时间内学习一点钟。太和县还结合兴修水利的生产情况编印出很受农民欢迎的识字课本。
    中共安徽省委、省人民委员会计划今年组织四百万人（占全省青壮年文盲的40％）入民校学习，并争取在今年秋收后消灭四十万文盲，为七年到十二年内全部消除文盲打下基础。现在全省训练了十二万多民校教师。定远、滁县、炳辉、阜南等县已超额完成了1957年的入学任务。阜阳县红旗社为了动员社员入民校还举行扫盲宣传周，除利用幻灯、大字报、广播筒、歌咏队、村头讲话宣传外，并召开四千多人参加的“向文化进军”大会，目前这个社已是“队队有民校、户户有学员”。
    安徽省为了把农村扫盲运动向前推进一步，还举办了扫盲动员广播大会，组织全省农民收听省委书记处书记桂林栖，省教育厅、妇联、青年团的负责同志作的动员报告，乡、社干部和优秀的民校讲师介绍教学和办学的经验。桂林栖同志在报告中要求全省一切识字的人都要为扫盲工作贡献力量，每个基层干部，农业社社员都要积极参加学习，今后在生产竞赛中，不论单位或个人都应将文化学习列为竞赛内容之一。（于风）
    又讯　浙江根据兰溪、萧山、缙云、岱山、海监、松阳等三十二个县和杭州市统计，已有十五万四千三百多人参加了文化学习。
    浙江省已初步作出扫盲规划。这个规划要求，在1965年内组织全省五百七十多万青壮年文盲、半文盲入学，每年冬季要有二百万到三百万农民参加学习，到1965年扫除文盲四百四十万，占80％，1967年内全部扫除文盲。现在各县也都订了扫盲计划。各地已训练了大批民校教师。这些民校教师中大部分是负责文教卫生的乡长、小学校长和负责社教工作的教师。据四十二县统计，目前已训练了二万七千九百七十多人。
    各地扫盲工作都紧密地结合了当前中心工作。衢县、诸暨等县民校教师、带课本、灯油，到水利工地上去上课。普陀、嵊泗、岱山、象山等县渔业社民校教师随渔民下海生产，他们利用海洋生产的空隙时间把“海船当课堂，黑板挂在桅杆上”来教学。
