Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd to specifically study the situation of the downward transfer of cadres from provincial-level organs. The meeting held that a surge of enthusiasm for registration for downward transfer of cadres from provincial-level organs has formed. However, the registration movement proceeded very quickly, and everyone's ideological preparation was not very sufficient. The ideological work and organizational work of the leadership were unable to keep up tightly for a time. Therefore, many organs have the following situation: only a minority firmly requested downward transfer, and an even smaller number firmly refused downward transfer. A considerable number of people are following the crowd and wavering. When they encounter a wave of registration, they are unwilling not to register; but after registering, they have many concerns and cannot make up their minds. They are willing to go down and integrate with workers and peasants, but they are afraid of being farmers and workers for the rest of their lives. They are willing to go down to train themselves, but they are afraid of the hardship in the countryside and afraid of not being able to bear it. Now, this group of people is wavering very severely, and they most need the guidance and help of the Party.

The Provincial Party Committee meeting considered this situation and believed that the leading cadres of various organs should currently first conduct meticulous ideological work for these people, help them truly understand their thinking, and truly understand the political significance of downward transfer of cadres, so that once the leadership approves, they can go down happily. The Provincial Party Committee believes that "comprehensive training" and "batch downward transfer" are a complete policy and practice for our downward transfer of cadres. After the downward transfer, some people will settle down in rural factories for a long time and become workers and peasants; some will become grassroots cadres; and some, after training, will return to the leading organs and become excellent cadres. Of course, when doing this, whether it is training for several years or being a worker or peasant for a long time, there will be tremendous changes in life and work. This is a revolution. The majority of cadres, after profound anti-Rightist struggle education, will understand the historical significance of this change, and understand the benefits to the revolution and to themselves. Their enthusiastic registration shows this. Their wavering just shows the difficulty of this change. Our Party will always believe in the majority of the masses. The Party's current responsibility lies only in carefully guiding them and encouraging them. In specific practices, more use can be made of group discussion meetings and individual talks, presided over by leading cadres themselves, using an enthusiastic attitude to mobilize everyone to specifically state their thoughts and difficulties. Ideological problems should be solved by persuasion. Regarding difficulties, the leading organs must do their best to solve them if they are reasonable, such as appropriately taking care of the individual's original skills, taking care of their health, and taking care of the life of the couple when assigning work during downward transfer.

The Provincial Party Committee meeting also studied the organizational arrangements for the downward transfer of cadres, requiring that all downward transferred cadres be arranged properly and each find their place. In addition to the downward transferred cadres of each special district and county being arranged by each special district and county themselves, about 40,000 people need to be arranged uniformly by the provincial leading organs. The downward transferred cadres will adopt the method of concentrated downward transfer, organized into teams, led by backbones, and sent down to one county, or even several agricultural cooperatives. As for the specific issues of political treatment, material treatment, etc. of the downward transferred cadres, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee are also preparing to quickly formulate a specific method according to the instructions of the Central Government.

Solving the ideological concerns and specific difficulties of the downward transferred cadres requires the leading organs and leading cadres to be responsible for the downward transferred cadres to the end. The Provincial Party Committee requires that before each downward transferred cadre is sent down, the leading cadres can have at least one long, sincere heart-to-heart talk with him. The leading organs and leading cadres must devote sufficient energy to carry out this work. Any slackness is not allowed. It is even more necessary to prevent the absolutely wrong ideas and practices of "pushing them out" and "pushing them out and being done with it". In practice, the provincial leading organs can concentrate all their efforts before January 20 to grasp the work of downward transfer of cadres, eliminate the ideological concerns and specific difficulties of the downward transferred cadres, determine the list of downward transfers, and send advance personnel to the downward transfer areas to set up camp and make contact. After the 20th, start to gradually organize the downward transfer of cadres. Most of the downward transferred cadres at the department and bureau level or above are responsible for leading work in lower-level organs. Their downward transfer cannot be delayed until the Spring Festival, so as not to delay spring plowing. The Provincial Party Committee also requires that the leading organs for rectification be able to quickly equip cadres to strengthen the leading work of downward transfer of cadres.

### 使下放干部高兴而去各得其所  广东省委提出作好思想和组织工作

    使下放干部高兴而去各得其所
    广东省委提出作好思想和组织工作
    本报特约新华社广州7日电中共广东省委于2日下午集会，专门研究了省级机关干部下放的情况。会议认为省级机关干部下放的报名热潮形成了。但是，报名运动进行得很快，大家的思想准备不很充分，领导上的思想工作和组织工作一时来不及紧紧跟上去，因此，许多机关都存在着这样的情况：坚决地要求下放的是少数，坚决地拒绝下放的更是极少数。相当多数的人都是随大流的，动摇的。他们碰到一股报名之风，不报名，不甘心；报了名，又顾虑重重，拿不定主意。他们愿意下去和工农相结合，可是又怕当一辈子农民和工人，愿意下去锻炼自己，但是又怕农村苦，怕受不了。现在，这一批人动摇的很厉害，最需要党的指导与帮助。
    省委会议考虑了这一情况，认为各机关的领导干部，当前首先应该对这些人进行细致的思想工作，帮助他们真正地弄通思想，真正地懂得干部下放的政治意义，等到领导一旦批准，就能够高高兴兴的下去。省委认为，“全面锻炼”和“批下放”，是我们下放干部的一个完整的方针和做法。下放以后，一部分人将在农村工厂长期落户，变成工人和农民；一部分将变成基层干部；一部分经过锻炼以后，将会回到领导机关，成为优秀的干部。当然，这样做的时候，无论锻炼几年也好，长期当工人农民也好，生活上、工作上，都要经历巨大的转变。这是一种革命。多数干部经过深刻的反右派斗争教育后，是会懂得这个转变的历史意义的，懂得对革命，对他们自己的好处的，他们踊跃报名，就说明了这一点。他们动摇，正说明了这个转变的不易。我们党永远相信群众的多数。党目前的责任只在于细心地引导他们，鼓励他们。具体做法上，可多采用小组座谈会和个别谈话的形式，由领导干部亲自主持，用热情的态度，发动大家具体地摆思想，摆困难。思想问题，用说服方法去解决。困难问题，凡属合理的，领导机关一定要尽力解决，譬如下放时分配的工作，可适当地照顾本人原有的技能，照顾身体，照顾夫妇生活等等。
    省委会议还研究了下放干部的组织安排问题，要求做到对所有下放干部，尽力安排得当，各得其所。除各专区各县的下放干部，由各专区各县自行安置外，需要由省领导机关统一安排的约四万人。下放干部，将采用集中下放的办法，组织成队伍，有骨干带领，下放到一个县去，甚至几个农业社去。至于下放干部的政治待遇、物质待遇等等具体问题，省委和省人委也正根据中央指示，准备迅速地拟订一个具体办法。
    解决下放干部的思想顾虑和具体困难问题，都要求领导机关领导干部能够对下放干部负责到底。省委要求每一个下放干部下放以前，能有领导干部至少跟他做一次长时间的、恳切的谈心。领导机关、领导干部，要拿出足够的精力进行这一工作，任何松懈，都是不许可的。更要防止“推出去”、“一推了之”的绝对错误的想法和做法。做法上，省领导机关可在1月20日前集中全力，抓好干部下放的工作，解除下放干部的思想顾虑和具体困难，确定下放名单，派出先遣人员去下放地区设营联络。20日后，开始陆续组织干部下放。厅、局长级以上的下放干部，多是到下级机关负责领导工作，他们的下放不能推迟到春节，以免耽误春耕。省委还要求各整风领导机构能够迅速配齐干部，好加强干部下放的领导工作。
