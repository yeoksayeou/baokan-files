Xinhua News Agency Report:

    After nearly five years of vigorous dredging, the West Lake in Hangzhou is basically completed. This is the largest dredging project in the history of West Lake.
    Now, the water depth of West Lake has increased from an average of 7 decimeters before dredging to 2 meters, and the water storage capacity has more than doubled, making the lake water appear even clearer and more pristine.
    From the Song Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty, West Lake underwent several major dredging projects, but it has not been dredged for nearly three hundred years; as a result, lake silt accumulated, the lake bed rose, and the lake water gradually became turbid. This dredging began in March 1952, and since the spring of 1954, several dredgers have been busy day and night, digging up the silt and sending it to mud suction barges, which then transported it through long mud pipelines to distant open fields.
    Over the past five years, a total of more than 6 million cubic meters of lake silt has been dredged, and this silt has been used to fill 2,100 mu of depressions and ponds, adding a lot of land for urban construction and greening in Hangzhou, while also eliminating breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies. Due to the increase in water storage in West Lake, it is also of great benefit to irrigating 100,000 mu of farmland in the suburbs of Hangzhou and the Hang County area.

### 经过几年大力疏浚  西湖越发明净清澈

    经过几年大力疏浚
    西湖越发明净清澈
    新华社讯　为时将近五年的疏浚杭州西湖的工程基本结束了。这是西湖有史以来规模最大的一次疏浚。
    现在，西湖的水深已经从疏浚前的平均七公寸增加到两公尺，蓄水量扩大一倍多，湖水显得越发明净清澈。
    从宋代到明朝，西湖曾经经过几次较大的疏浚，但是近三百年来却一直没有疏浚过；因此湖泥淤积，湖床增高，湖水日渐浑浊。这次疏浚是从1952年3月开始的，1954年春天起就有好几艘挖泥船日夜忙碌着，把淤泥挖送到吸泥机船上，再经过长长的输泥管输送到远处的旷野去。
    五年来疏浚出的湖泥共有六百多万立方公尺，这些湖泥填盖了二千一百亩洼地和水塘，为杭州市的城市建筑和绿化增加了不少用地，同时消灭了蚊蚋孳生地。由于西湖蓄水量增加，对灌溉杭州市郊区和杭县一带的十万亩农田也有很大好处。
