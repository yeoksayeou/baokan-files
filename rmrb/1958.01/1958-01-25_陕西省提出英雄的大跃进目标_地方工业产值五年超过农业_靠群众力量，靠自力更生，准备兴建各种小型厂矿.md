This dispatch from Xi'an on the 24th by our reporter Zhu Bo reports: Let local industry take a Great Leap Forward, enabling local industry to blossom everywhere in the countryside, and causing the total output value of local industry to increase several times over, striving to surpass the province's total agricultural output value within five years—this is the heroic goal recently put forward by the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China at a conference of factory and mine Party committee secretaries and industrial leaders at all levels.

Shaanxi Province has every possibility of completing this enormous task. After three years of recovery work and the victorious completion of the first Five-Year Plan, Shaanxi Province's local industry has already laid a solid foundation. At present, the total output value of local industry has more than doubled compared to five years ago, and the variety and quality of industrial products have both significantly increased and improved. There are already thousands of kinds of industrial products. For example, light industrial products include various enamelware, paints, textiles, knitted goods, glassware, leather, rubber products, paper, etc.; heavy industrial products include coal, iron, steel, sulfur, gold, asbestos, small and medium-sized machine tools, power equipment, and agricultural machinery. The quality of many of these products has reached advanced levels domestically, and more than twenty kinds of products are sold far overseas, where they have received favorable reviews in the international market. The technical strength of local industry has also improved over the past few years; much equipment can be manufactured independently, and there is also support from many technical schools and state-owned factories. In terms of industrial raw materials, after several years of exploration, the province is full of raw materials for developing local industry. The mountainous areas have rich mineral deposits, such as coal, iron, and petroleum in northern Shaanxi, and iron, molybdenum, copper, vanadium, nickel, silver, gold, lead, and zinc in the Qinling and Daba Mountains in southern Shaanxi. In the plains, there is cotton for developing the textile industry, as well as many other agricultural and sideline processing raw materials. Other factors, such as the broad sales channels for local industrial products and the gradual improvement of transportation conditions, all provide favorable conditions for promoting the Great Leap Forward in local industry.

Of course, there are also difficulties in developing local industry, such as the funding problem for local industry and the cadre problem for new enterprises; however, the heads of Party committees at all levels in Shaanxi Province believe that as long as revolutionary enthusiasm is displayed, these difficulties can be overcome. For example, Ningqiang County has initially determined to vigorously develop local industry with the spirit of investing less, or no investment, and doing things well, relying on the strength of the masses and self-reliance. They believe that small factories and mines can be run even without state funding. The county is preparing to mine asbestos, planning to organize the labor force of local agricultural cooperatives (ten people are enough), which can produce fifty tons of asbestos a year, with an output value of 40,000 yuan; in the second year, this 40,000 yuan can be invested to further development. The county is also preparing to organize the masses to mine other discovered mineral deposits.

Party committees and factory and mine leaders at all levels in Shaanxi Province are full of confidence in realizing this glorious and arduous task. Various localities have first taken stock of various local industries and calculated a major account. Provincial leaders have also studied this issue with local and county Party committees and put forward a goal. By 1962, it is estimated that the total agricultural output value of the province can reach around 3.5 billion yuan, with a minimum of no less than 3 billion yuan. After studying with various localities, the total output value of local industry in the province can reach 3.45 billion to 3.94 billion yuan by 1962 (Xi'an City is about 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion yuan, Baoji 300 million to 350 million yuan, Xianyang about 400 million yuan, Tongchuan 50 million to 70 million yuan, Hanzhong Prefecture 300 million yuan, Shangluo Prefecture 200 million yuan, Ankang Prefecture 150 million yuan, Yan'an Prefecture 50 million to 70 million yuan, Yulin Prefecture 100 million yuan, the forty counties in Guanzhong total more than 500 million yuan, striving to reach 600 million yuan, of which ten counties can reach 20 million yuan, the remaining thirty or so counties reach 10 million yuan, and the Provincial Department of Industry strives to reach 100 million to 200 million yuan).

At present, in accordance with the spirit of the Great Leap Forward in local industry, various localities in Shaanxi Province have decided to increase the total output value of local industry this year by one-third to one-half based on the original figures for 1957. Some areas have initially proposed opinions on developing local industry based on their different local conditions. In mountainous areas, the main focus is on fully utilizing the industrial resources of the mountainous areas to develop small factories and mines, small native product processing factories, etc. For example, Shangluo Prefecture plans to build forty-six small factories and mines during the second Five-Year Plan. These include small metal mines and coal kilns, small farm implement factories, small native product processing factories, etc. In order to realize this plan as soon as possible, Shangluo Prefecture has already taken action, adopting the steps of surveying, trial mining, building factories, and production at the same time, gradually expanding the development of local industry from scratch, from small to large. Based on its specific conditions, Ningqiang County plans to mobilize the masses to build small mines for mining asbestos, coal, silver, iron, etc., and prepare to set up wineries and paper mills. The county produces more than 3 million catties of apricots and various other fruits annually, and starting a winery can produce 1 million catties of wine a year. Hancheng, Zichang, and other places have very rich iron and coal reserves, and the local people also have mining experience, preparing to focus on developing small iron and coal mines. Hancheng County plans to build ten small iron smelters with a daily output of one ton this year, striving to produce 1,800 tons of pig iron this year, increasing to 7,000 tons next year, and striving to make the output value of pig iron exceed the total agricultural output value by 1962; if the development of small coal kilns is added, income can be further increased. In the plains, various counties have also initially proposed plans for developing local industry based on their specific conditions. For example, Chenggu County will actively develop various small industries in accordance with the policy of local industry being oriented towards the countryside, serving the development of the agricultural economy, and closely integrated with the agricultural economy. This year, the county will build a flour processing factory with a daily output of 50,000 catties, a rice processing factory with a daily output of 25,000 catties, a winery with a daily output of 500 to 800 catties, and a paper mill with a daily output of one to two tons, as well as a comprehensive native product processing factory. With the great development of agriculture, Chenggu County is preparing to expand the farm implement repair and manufacturing factory and establish four fertilizer plants in five directly affiliated townships in the three plains. These small industries are expected to be put into production in the third quarter of this year. At this rate, Chenggu County is confident that the output value of local industry will exceed the total agricultural output value this year. The preliminary arrangement in Weinan County is to organize existing factories to expand production on the one hand. For example, a farm implement manufacturing factory with seventy or eighty workers can produce new products such as boiler-towing machines and water pumps; the original yarn factory with more than 3,000 spindles plans to expand the number of spindles; yarn factories and medicinal material processing factories will also be built.

In order to complete this task, leaders at all levels believe that it is necessary to firmly grasp and strengthen the rectification leadership of the industrial system, and at present, the anti-waste movement should be pushed further, resolutely and thoroughly, so that anti-waste becomes a climax of the rectification movement. Only in this way can the policy of running enterprises industriously and thriftily be smoothly implemented in the great development of local industry, realizing the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. They all believe that whether conservative thinking can be overcome is the key to whether Shaanxi Province's local industry can take a Great Leap Forward and whether the total output value of local industry can catch up with and exceed the total agricultural output value in 1962. For this reason, Party committees at all levels are guiding cadres and the masses to fully recognize the favorable conditions for developing local industry, criticizing and overcoming conservative thinking, and quickly formulating local industrial development plans.

    陕西省提出英雄的大跃进目标
    地方工业产值五年超过农业
    靠群众力量，靠自力更生，准备兴建各种小型厂矿
    本报西安24日电　记者朱波报道：让地方工业来个大跃进，使地方工业在农村遍地开花，使地方工业总产值狠狠地翻上几翻，争取在五年内超过本省农业总产值，这是最近中共陕西省委召开的全省厂矿党委书记、各级党委专管工业负责人会议提出的英雄的奋斗目标。
    陕西省完成这个巨大的任务是有充分可能的。经过三年的恢复工作和第一个五年建设计划的胜利完成，陕西省的地方工业已经打下了可靠的基础。目前，地方工业总产值已比五年前增长了一倍多，工业产品的品种、质量都有显著的增加与提高。工业产品已有数千种。例如轻工业品中有各种搪瓷品、油漆、纺织针织品、玻璃产品、皮革、橡胶品、纸张等，重工业产品中有煤、铁、钢、硫磺、黄金、石棉、中小型机床、动力设备、农业机械等。这些产品质量，有很多已达到国内的先进水平，有二十多种产品远销国外，并在国际市场上得到了好评。地方工业的技术力量几年来也提高了，很多设备可以自己制造，并且还有很多技术学校和国营工厂的支援。在工业原料方面，经过几年来的勘察，全省遍地都有发展地方工业的原料。山区有丰富的矿藏，例如陕北的煤、铁、石油等，陕南秦岭和大巴山区的铁、钼、铜、钒、镍、银、金、铅、锌等。在平川地区，有发展纺织工业的棉花以及其他很多农副业加工原料。其他如地方工业销路的广阔，交通条件的逐渐改善等等，都给促进地方工业大跃进提供了有利的条件。
    当然，发展地方工业也有困难，例如地方工业的资金问题，新建企业的干部问题等；但是，陕西省各级党委负责人认为，只要拿出革命的干劲，这些困难都是可以克服的。例如宁强县初步确定要用投资少、不投资办好事的精神，依靠群众的力量，靠自力更生，来大力发展地方工业。他们认为在没有国家资金的情况下，也可以办小型的厂矿。这个县准备开采石棉矿，计划组织当地农业社的劳动力（共十个人就够了）来开采，一年可以产五十吨石棉，产值就有四万元；第二年就可以把这四万元投进去，进一步发展。这个县还准备组织群众开采已经发现的其他矿藏。
    陕西省各级党委和各厂矿负责人对实现这一光荣而又艰巨的任务充满了信心。各地事先都对各种地方工业摸了底，算了一笔大账。省级负责人也分别和各地委、县委研究了这个问题，并提出了一个奋斗目标。到1962年，预计全省农业总产值可达三十五亿元左右，最低不会少于三十亿元。地方工业总产值，经过和各地研究的结果，到1962年，全省可以达到三十四亿五千万到三十九亿四千万元（西安市约十三亿到十五亿元，宝鸡三亿到三亿五千万元，咸阳约四亿元，铜川五千万到七千万元，汉中专区三亿元，商雒专区两亿元，安康专区一亿五千万元，延安专区五千万到七千万元，榆林专区一亿元，关中四十个县合计五亿多元，争取达到六亿元，其中有十个县可达到二千万元，其余三十多个县达到一千万元，省工业厅争取达到一亿到二亿元）。
    目前，陕西省各地根据地方工业大跃进的精神，决定使今年地方工业总产值，在原有的基础上比1957年增长三分之一到二分之一。有些地区已经根据当地不同的情况，初步提出了发展地方工业的意见。在山区，主要充分利用山区的工业资源，发展小型厂矿、小型土特产加工厂等。例如商雒专区计划在第二个五年计划内，新建四十六个小型厂矿。其中有小型的各种金属矿和煤窑，有小型的农具厂，小型土特产加工厂等。为了早日实现这个计划，商雒专区已经行动起来了，采取了边勘察、边试采、边建厂、边生产的步骤，从无到有、从小到大，逐步扩大发展地方工业。宁强县根据本县具体条件，计划发动群众建设开采石棉、煤、银、铁等小型矿，准备办酒厂、纸厂等。这个县年产三百多万斤杏子和其他各种水果，开办一个酒厂，一年就可以产一百万斤酒。韩城、子长等地，铁、煤藏量都非常丰富，当地人民也有采矿的经验，准备重点发展小型铁矿和煤矿。韩城县计划今年建设十个日产一吨的小型炼铁炉，争取今年生产灰生铁一千八百吨，明年增长到七千吨，争取到1962年使生铁的产值超过农业总产值，如再加上发展小型煤窑等，收入还可增加。在平川地区，各县也根据当地具体条件，初步提出了发展地方工业的规划。例如城固县将按照地方工业面向农村，为农业经济发展服务与农业经济密切结合的方针，积极地发展各种小型工业。这个县今年将新建日产五万斤的面粉加工厂，日产两万五千斤的大米加工厂，日产五百到八百斤酒的酒厂，和日产一吨到二吨的造纸厂以及土产山货综合加工厂各一座。随着农业的大发展，城固县准备扩建农具修配制造厂，并在三个平川地五个直属乡镇建立四个肥料厂。这些小型工业争取在今年第三季度投入生产。按照这样的速度，城固县地方工业的产值在今年内就有把握超过农业总产值。渭南县初步安排的结果是，一方面组织现有的工厂扩大生产。如拥有七、八十个工人的农具制造厂，可以生产锅驼机、水泵等新产品；原有一座三千多纱锭的纱厂，计划扩大纱锭数量；还将建造纱厂、药材加工厂等。
    为了完成这个任务，各级领导人认为必须抓紧和加强工业系统的整风领导，目前特别应该把反浪费运动推进一步，要坚决彻底的搞，使反浪费成为整风运动的一个高潮。这样才能在地方工业大发展中，顺利贯彻勤俭办企业，实现多、快、好、省的方针。他们都认为能否克服保守思想是陕西省地方工业能否大跃进，地方工业的总产值能否在1962年赶上并超过农业总产值的关键。为此，各级党委正在引导干部和群众充分认识到发展地方工业的有利条件，批判和克服保守思想，并迅速地制订出地方工业发展规划。
