    Stinking is Still Stinking

    The surging tide of anti-colonialism has made the colonialists a little flustered. British Lord Brabazon, seeing that the word "colony" smells too bad, wants to suggest that the government change the "Colonial Office" to the "Overseas Territories Department."

    Mr. Brabazon probably hasn't read Shakespeare's immortal line. In "Romeo and Juliet," Juliet says to Romeo: "What's in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet." By the same token, if you change the notorious "Colonial Office" to a new signboard, will it not still stink?

    臭的还是臭的
    反殖民主义浪潮汹涌澎湃，使得殖民者有点发慌。英国上院议员巴比鉴于“殖民地”这个字太臭，想建议政府把“殖民地部”改成“海外领土部”。
    巴比先生大概没有读过莎士比亚的不朽名句。在“铸情”里，朱丽叶对罗密欧说：“姓名本来是没有意义的；把玫瑰花换个名字，它还不是一样的香吗？”同样的道理，把臭名远扬的“殖民地部”换上一个新招牌，难道就不臭了么？
