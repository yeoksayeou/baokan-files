To further promote rural sports, the Shandong Provincial Cultural Bureau, the Provincial Sports Commission, and the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League have made some regulations on strengthening the leadership of rural sports, based on the specific conditions of the province's rural areas, and recently issued a joint notice. The main contents of the notice are as follows:

    Sports associations are a good organizational form for leading and carrying out rural sports activities. Sports associations that have been established in agricultural cooperatives should, under the leadership of the cooperative and the Party branch, be specifically responsible by the Communist Youth League and closely cooperate with rural clubs to carry out their work.

    According to the current situation, it is not possible to widely establish grassroots sports associations in rural areas. Rural clubs should regard sports activities as the main content of amateur cultural activities and earnestly lead them (a sports group can be set up under the club).

    The Communist Youth League organizations should take mobilizing young people to participate in sports activities as a regular and important task. The Communist Youth League should provide specific leadership to the sports associations that have been established. In grassroots units where sports associations and club sports groups have not been established, the military sports committee member (or propaganda committee member) of the Communist Youth League branch (or general branch) can be at the core, absorbing sports team leaders, demobilized and transferred soldiers, educated youth, etc., to form a sports group or committee to lead sports activities, or the Communist Youth League branch or general branch can specifically lead them.

    Units under the Sports Commission and the Cultural Section Bureaus (cultural centers, stations, stadiums, clubs) should take carrying out various sports activities as a regular business and provide specific organization and leadership.

    进一步推动农村体育运动
    山东省提出几项要求
    本报讯　为了进一步推动农村体育运动，山东省文化局、省体育运动委员会和团省委根据本省农村的具体情况，对加强农村体育运动的领导问题作了一些规定，并于最近发出了联合通知。通知的主要内容是这样：
    体育协会是领导开展农村体育活动的一种良好的组织形式，在农业社中已建立的体育协会，都应该在社和党支部的领导下，由共青团具体负责，同农村俱乐部密切配合开展工作。
    根据目前情况，农村中不能广泛建立基层体育协会。农村俱乐部应该把体育活动作为业余文化活动的主要内容，认真领导起来（可在俱乐部下设体育组）。
    共青团组织应该把发动青年参加体育活动作为经常的重要工作之一。共青团对已建立的体育协会应该加以具体领导。未建立体育协会和俱乐部体育组的基层单位，可以团支部（或总支）的军事体育委员（或宣传委员）为核心，吸收各运动队长、复员转业军人、知识青年等组成体育小组或委员会，领导体育活动，或由团支部或总支来具体领导。
    体委和文化科局所属的单位（文化馆、站、体育场、俱乐部），应该把开展各种体育活动，作为经常的业务之一，加以具体的组织和领导。
