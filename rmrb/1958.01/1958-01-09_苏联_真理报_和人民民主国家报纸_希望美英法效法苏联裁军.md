    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th. The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an editorial today entitled "An Important Contribution to Easing International Tensions," commenting on the great significance of the Soviet Union's decision to further reduce its armed forces.

    The editorial said that, as everyone knows, in 1955 and 1956, the Soviet Union had already reduced its armed forces by 1.84 million men. Including the number of people reduced this time, the total reaches 2.14 million. Thus, before reaching a universal disarmament agreement, the Soviet Union has already taken important unilateral steps for the third time to reduce its armed forces and armaments, in order to ease tensions and build an atmosphere of trust between countries.

    The editorial said that this Soviet reduction of armed forces is of even greater significance because this disarmament is happening when Western countries, especially the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, are redoubling their efforts to intensify the arms race. The Soviet Union is constantly reducing military expenditures, while the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization increase military expenditures year after year. For example, the United States plans to increase direct military expenditures to 40 billion to 43 billion US dollars in a single year, and is openly discussing the issue of increasing military expenditures to 50 billion US dollars by 1960. In 1958, US monopoly organizations will sign military order contracts with a total value of 23 billion US dollars, which is 50% more than last year. This is why these powerful monopoly organizations advocate for the arms race.

    The editorial pointed out that the Soviet government's decision to once again substantially reduce the Soviet armed forces once again shows the world that the Soviet Union keeps its word. The Soviet Union's unilateral implementation of a new large-scale disarmament once again demonstrates its sincere hope to practically resolve the disarmament issue.

    "Pravda" said that there is no doubt that the European public will particularly welcome the part of the Soviet government's decision that concerns the reduction of Soviet armed forces stationed in the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Hungary. If Western countries also take corresponding measures to support this important step, it will greatly ease tensions in Europe.

    However, so far, Western countries, especially the United States, continue to amass their troops in the territories of other countries. For example, according to American newspapers, the United States has as many as 800,000 troops stationed on foreign territories. The stationing of American troops on the territories of other countries certainly does not contribute to the easing of international tensions, nor does it contribute to the cause of world peace.

    "Pravda" finally said that the initial reactions abroad to the Soviet Union's decision to reduce its armed forces once again prove that world public opinion warmly supports this peace-loving measure taken by the Soviet government. The Soviet people warmly support their government's peace initiatives, and hope that this sincere action can become an example for other countries, especially the major North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries—the United States, Britain, and France—that possess large armed forces. The Soviet people and other peace-loving people expect that the governments of these countries will finally also take practical measures to reduce armed forces and stop the heavy burden of the arms race.

    Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Newspapers in European and Asian people's democratic countries have published editorials and commentaries on TASS's statement regarding the further reduction of armed forces, warmly welcoming this measure. All newspapers emphasized that this Soviet measure is another major contribution to defending world peace and easing international tensions; at the same time, they hope that Western countries, especially the United States, Britain, and France, will follow the example of the Soviet Union.

### 苏联“真理报”和人民民主国家报纸  希望美英法效法苏联裁军

    苏联“真理报”和人民民主国家报纸
    希望美英法效法苏联裁军
    新华社莫斯科8日电　苏联“真理报”今天以“对缓和国际紧张局势的重要贡献”为题发表社论，评论苏联再次裁减武装部队决定的重大意义。
    社论说，大家知道，在1955年和1956年，苏联已经裁减武装部队一百八十四万人。加上这次裁减的人数，共达二百一十四万人。这样，苏联在达成普遍裁军协议以前，已经是第三次单方面地采取重要步骤来裁减武装部队和军备，以缓和紧张局势和在建立各国之间的信任气氛。
    社论说，苏联这一次裁减武装部队具有更加重大的意义，因为这次裁军正当西方国家，首先是北大西洋集团国家，重新竭力加紧军备竞赛的时候。苏联是在不断地减少军费开支，而北大西洋公约组织成员国则年年增加军费开支。例如美国，单是直接的军费开支在一年内就计划增加到四百到四百三十亿美元，并且还在公开讨论到1960年使军费开支达到五百亿美元的问题。1958年美国垄断组织将签订总值达二百三十亿美元的军事订货合同，即比去年多50％。这就是为什么这些有势力的垄断组织鼓吹军备竞赛的原因。
    社论指出，苏联政府关于再次大量裁减苏联武装部队的决定再一次地向全世界表明，苏联说到哪里就做到哪里。苏联单方面实行新的大量裁军再一次表明，它真诚地希望实际解决裁军问题。
    “真理报”说，毫无疑问，欧洲公众将特别欢迎苏联政府决定中有关裁减驻德意志民主共和国和匈牙利人民共和国的苏联武装部队的这一部分。如果西方国家也采取相应措施来支持这个重要步骤的话，那将会大大地缓和欧洲的紧张局势。
    但是，到目前为止，西方国家首先是美国仍然继续在其他国家领土上屯集自己的军队。例如，据美国报纸报道，美国驻扎在外国领土上的军队竟达八十万人之多。美国军队驻扎在其他国家领土上，这当然不会有助于国际紧张局势的缓和，也不会有助于世界和平事业。
    “真理报”最后说，国外对苏联再次裁减武装部队的决定的初步反应证明，世界舆论热烈拥护苏联政府这一次采取的爱好和平的措施。苏联人民热烈拥护自己政府的和平倡议，并且希望这种真心诚意的行动能够成为其他国家，首先是拥有大量武装部队的北大西洋集团主要国家——美国、英国和法国效法的榜样。苏联人民和其他爱好和平的人民期待这些国家的政府终于也能够采取裁减武装部队和停止负担沉重的军备竞赛的实际措施。
    据新华社8日讯　欧洲和亚洲人民民主国家的报纸对塔斯社关于再次裁减武装部队的声明纷纷发表社论和评论，热烈欢迎这一措施。各报都强调指出苏联这一措施是保卫世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势的又一重大贡献；同时希望西方国家，特别美英法三国效法苏联的榜样。
