It is reported that Bitar will stay in Cairo for three days. During this period, he will discuss the establishment of the Egyptian-Syrian federation with Egyptian President Nasser and the Egyptian authorities. Bitar will also meet Indonesian President Sukarno, who is currently visiting Egypt, in Cairo.

Before leaving Damascus, Bitar said that he would return to Damascus immediately on the 19th after completing the mission entrusted to him by the cabinet. He also said that the measures for realizing the Egyptian-Syrian federation would be specified in the next three days.

The Syrian News Agency said that Bitar was ordered to discuss the system and form of the Egyptian-Syrian federation with the Egyptian authorities and to understand their views on this aspect so that the Syrian authorities could concentrate on taking the necessary measures to realize the long-awaited federation. At the same time, Ambassador Riyad will report on his recent contacts with the Syrian authorities and their views on the measures to be taken on the federation issue.

The official bulletin of the Syrian Information Bureau on the 16th said that the Syrian economic delegation, which was negotiating economic unification with Egypt, has completed its research work and is now ready to hold talks with the relevant Egyptian authorities at any time. It is reported that the delegation will travel to Cairo next week.

Syrian President Kuwatly told reporters from "Al-Ra'i" on the 15th, "I am very happy that in my lifetime, I can see the core of Arab unity emerge through the realization of a federation between Syria and Egypt."

President Kuwatly said, "After foreign troops withdrew from Syria in 1946, and I raised the flag of independence, I once said that unless it is the flag of Arab unity, no other flag will be raised above this flag of independence."

President Kuwatly also said, "I hope that the comprehensive unity of all parts of the Arab countries, from the Atlantic to the Arabian Gulf, can be realized soon."

Syrian Prime Minister Asali also told "Al-Jamahir" reporters on the same day that every Arab hopes to establish a federation. He pointed out that the establishment of a federation will be realized on a voluntary basis, not through force.

"Al-Jamahir" also quoted Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar as saying, "We need a president, a cabinet, a federal parliament, and two local affairs committees."

Syrian Minister of Justice Kazberi said on the 15th that the Syrian cabinet has adopted important decisions on the establishment of the Egyptian-Syrian federation, which will be announced soon.

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：埃及和叙利亚两国成立联邦问题正在向新的阶段发展，叙利亚外交部长比塔尔在埃及驻叙利亚大使里亚德陪同下，16日中午到达开罗。
    据悉，比塔尔将在开罗停留三天。在这个期间，他将同埃及总统纳赛尔和埃及当局讨论关于成立埃及—叙利亚联邦的问题。比塔尔还将在开罗会见正在埃及访问的印度尼西亚总统苏加诺。
    比塔尔在离开大马士革之前说，他在完成了内阁所交付他的使命之后，就将立刻在19日返回大马士革。他还说，实现埃叙联邦的措施将在今后三天内具体化。
    叙利亚通讯社说，比塔尔奉命和埃及当局讨论埃叙联邦的制度和形式，并且了解他们对这方面的观点，以便使叙利亚当局能够集中力量着手采取实现等待已久的联邦的必要措施。同时，里亚德大使将汇报他最近和叙利亚当局的接触情况，以及他们对于在联邦问题上应采取的措施的看法。
    叙利亚新闻局的正式公报16日说，和埃及会谈经济统一问题的叙利亚经济代表团已经结束了它的研究工作，现在准备随时和有关的埃及当局进行会谈。据悉，这个代表团将在下星期前往开罗。
    叙利亚总统库阿特利15日对“舆论报”记者说，我很高兴在我这一生中，能够看到阿拉伯统一的核心将通过实现叙利亚同埃及之间的联邦而出现。
    库阿特利总统说，在外国军队1946年撤离叙利亚，在我升起了独立的旗帜以后，我曾经说过，除非是阿拉伯统一的旗帜，否则将不会有任何旗帜升在这个独立的旗帜上面。
    库阿特利总统又说，我希望不久以后能够实现包括从大西洋到阿拉伯海湾的阿拉伯国家各部分的全面的统一。
    叙利亚总理阿萨利同一天也对“群众报”记者说，每一个阿拉伯人都希望成立联邦。他指出，成立联邦将在自愿的基础上实现，而不是通过武力来实现。
    “群众报”还援引了叙利亚外交部长比塔尔的话说，我们需要一个总统，一个内阁，一个联邦议会和两个地方事务委员会。
    叙利亚司法部长卡兹贝里15日说，叙利亚内阁已经就成立埃—叙联邦的问题通过了重要的决定，这个决定不久将宣布。
