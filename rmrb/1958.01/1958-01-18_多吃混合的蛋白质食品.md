    Eat More Mixed Protein Foods
    Qū Huìqīng
    Protein is an important component of food and the main raw material that constitutes the human body. If we do not get the proper amount of protein in our diet, life will cease.
    Speaking of which, some people may wonder, "I haven't eaten chicken, duck, or eggs for months or years, why am I still living healthily?" In fact, protein is not only found in eggs, but also in many foods. According to the source of protein, it can be divided into animal and vegetable categories. Animal protein mainly comes from lean meats (beef, mutton, pork, chicken, duck, fish, etc.) and dairy products, eggs, etc. Vegetable protein mainly comes from beans and grains. Vegetables contain the least amount of protein.
    The nutritional value of protein depends on the quality and quantity of amino acids it contains. Amino acids are further divided into essential and non-essential amino acids. The former cannot be manufactured by the animal itself and must be obtained from food. Lack of it will cause abnormal physiological functions and growth stagnation. Non-essential amino acids can be manufactured in the body. Generally speaking, animal protein has a higher nutritional value; among foods containing vegetable protein, soybeans and their products (tofu, soy milk, etc.) are the best.
    It is particularly important to note that when selecting and matching foods, animal and vegetable protein foods should be eaten mixed as much as possible, which can greatly improve the nutritional value of protein. Cooking methods such as minced meat with tofu, egg drop soup with soft tofu, and pork with dried bean curd can all improve the function of protein in the body. This is because the insufficient portion of amino acids contained in bean protein can be compensated by meat and egg foods. At the same time, judging from the current supply of non-staple foods on the market and the living standards of the people, it is also advisable to promote the use of this mixed protein food.

    多吃混合的蛋白质食品
    区慧清
    蛋白质，是食物中的重要成分，是构成人体的主要原料。如果我们在膳食中得不到应有分量的蛋白质，生命就会随之停止。
    说到这里，有人也许会发生疑问：“我已经几个月或几年没有吃过鸡鸭蛋了，为什么还活得很健康呢？”其实，蛋白质不仅蛋中含有，很多食物中都含有。根据蛋白质的来源，可以分为动物性和植物性两类。动物性蛋白质，主要来自瘦的肉类（牛、羊、猪、鸡、鸭、鱼等）和乳类、蛋类等。植物性蛋白质，主要来自豆类和五谷。青菜中蛋白质含量最少。
    蛋白质的营养价值取决于它所含的氨基酸的质和量。氨基酸又分为必需氨基酸和非必需氨基酸。前者动物本身不能制造，必须由食物得来。缺乏了它就会使生理机能反常，生长停顿。非必需氨基酸可以在身体里面制造。一般地说，动物性蛋白质的营养价值比较高；而在含有植物性蛋白质的食物中，以大豆及其制品（豆腐、豆浆等）最优良。
    特别值得注意的，在选配食物时，应该尽可能地采用动植物性蛋白质食品混合着吃，这样就可以大大地提高蛋白质的营养价值。如肉末烧豆腐、南豆腐鸡蛋花、猪肉烧千张等烹调方法，都可以提高蛋白质对身体的功用。这是因为豆类蛋白质中所含的氨基酸的不足部分，可由肉、蛋类食物作为补偿。同时，从目前市场上的副食品供应情况，以及人民生活水平来看，也应该提倡多采用这种混合的蛋白质食品。
