A Good Example of Comprehensive Utilization of Raw Materials
Chongqing Agricultural Products Factory Has No Waste

    (Our dispatch) According to a report in the Sichuan Daily: The Chongqing Agricultural Products Factory, adhering to the principle of running enterprises diligently and frugally, and relying on a spirit of hard work, has rapidly developed from a small winery with an annual output value of less than 600,000 yuan into a comprehensive production factory capable of producing more than 60 kinds of export canned goods and fruit wines in just over two years. The output value has increased seventeen and a half times. In the past year alone, the profits turned over to the state amounted to 430,000 yuan, equivalent to 2.6 times the state's total investment over two years.
    Before 1954, the Chongqing Agricultural Products Factory was only a winery capable of producing white spirits. In 1955, the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Industry decided to expand it into a comprehensive factory producing export canned goods and wines. They managed to utilize the workers' dormitories, dining halls, brick kilns, etc., of a nearby brick factory that had ceased production, and also purchased some canning machinery and equipment from Shanghai piecemeal. In this way, a factory that originally required more than one million yuan to expand was put into production in October 1955 with only a state investment of more than 40,000 yuan and the acceptance of a prepayment from the export company.
    When the factory first started, it could only produce red tangerine and canned pork. There were few product varieties, and whenever red tangerines were off the market or pork sources were scarce, the factory was underutilized. In order to avoid seasonal shutdowns, the factory decided to expand the variety of products and utilize the discarded tomatoes, peaches, plums, apricots, sweet potatoes, longans, and other fruits and vegetables from nearby rural areas to process them into various canned goods and fruit jams. This not only helped farmers increase their income but also expanded the sources of export goods.
    In order to open up avenues for increasing production, they tried every possible means to utilize every bit of raw material as much as possible to make various by-products and expand production. If fruits such as red tangerines, peaches, plums, and apricots were not suitable for manufacturing export canned goods, they were used to brew various fruit wines or synthetic wines, and the crushed dregs were fermented to make brandy. The peels, stems, and pits of the tangerines were also utilized, baked, and made into medicinal materials. Fragrant oil was also extracted from the tangerine peel for use as a chemical raw material. In the process of manufacturing canned pork, attention was also paid to the comprehensive utilization of raw materials. Pig organs such as the liver, heart, lungs, and trotters were all used to make canned goods and cured products of various flavors. The scrap meat removed from the bones was also used to make sausages, and the meat bones were boiled into chemical oil. The workers proudly called their factory "a factory with no waste." In this way, they not only overcame the difficulties of seasonal shutdowns caused by insufficient raw materials but also increased output and reduced costs.
    This factory also actively tried to reduce the consumption quota of raw materials and the time quota of work, and reduce defective products.
    Because this factory has achieved remarkable results in running the factory diligently and frugally, the Ministry of Food Industry recently awarded a banner with the inscription: "Continue to implement the policy of building the country diligently and frugally, and make greater achievements in the comprehensive utilization of raw materials."
    Recently, this factory formulated a production increase and savings plan for 1958. In this plan, they proposed to further tap potential. In addition to ensuring the comprehensive completion of the state plan, they will continue to increase the production of canned goods and wines by another 2.35 million yuan from reducing the consumption quota of raw materials, comprehensively utilizing raw materials, and expanding new varieties, saving the state 357,000 yuan in funds.

    综合利用原料的好榜样
    重庆农产制造厂没有一点废料
    本报讯　据四川日报报道：重庆农产制造厂本着勤俭办企业的方针，凭着一股干劲，经过短短的两年多时间，就从一个年产总值不到六十万元的小酒厂，迅速发展成为能生产六十多种出口罐头和果酒的综合性生产工厂，产值增长了十七倍半。仅去年一年，上缴给国家的利润就有四十三万元，相当于国家两年多全部投资的二点六倍。
    重庆农产制造厂在1954年以前还是一个仅能生产白酒的酿酒厂。1955年，重庆市工业局决定把它扩建为一个生产出口罐头和酒类的综合性工厂。他们设法把附近已经停止生产的砖瓦厂的职工宿舍、饭堂、砖瓦窑等利用起来，另外从上海零星购置了一部分制造罐头的机器设备。就这样，一个原来需要上百万元才能扩建成的工厂，只花了国家四万多元的投资和接受了出口公司的一笔预付订金，便在1955年10月开工投入生产了。
    工厂初开工，只能生产红橘和猪肉罐头两种，产品品种少，每当红橘下市、猪源缺乏的时候，便开工不足。为了避免季节性的停工，工厂决定扩大产品花色品种，把附近农村中废弃的蕃茄、桃、李、杏、地瓜、桂元等果蔬都利用起来，加工制成各种罐头和果子酱。这样既帮助农民增加了收入，又扩大了出口货源。
    为了开辟增产途径，他们千方百计地设法把一点一滴的原料，都尽可能加以利用，作成各种副产品，扩大生产。红橘、桃、李、杏等果品如果不合于制造出口的罐头，就利用它来酿成各种果酒或合成酒，碎渣经过发酵用来制成白兰地。橘子的皮、茎、核也都利用起来，加以烘制作成药材。又从橘皮中提炼香油供作化工原料。在制造猪肉罐头的过程中，同样注意原料的综合利用。猪的内脏如像肝、心、肺和猪脚，都用来制成各色各味的罐头和腌腊制品。还把骨头上剔下的碎肉渣灌成香肠，把肉骨头熬成化工油。职工们都自豪地称他们的工厂是“一个没有废料的工厂”。这样，他们不仅克服了因原材料不足而带来的季节性停工的困难，而且增加了产量，降低了成本。
    这个厂还积极设法降低原材料的消耗定额和工时定额，减少废品。
    由于这个厂勤俭办厂有显著成绩，最近食品工业部特奖给锦旗一面，上面写着：“继续贯彻勤俭建国方针，在综合利用原料方面，做出更大成就。”
    最近，这个厂制订了1958年的增产节约计划。在这个计划里，他们提出要进一步挖掘潜力，除保证全面完成国家计划外，要继续从降低原材料的消耗定额，综合利用原料、扩大新品种等方面，再增产二百三十五万元的罐头和酒类，替国家节约资金三十五万七千元。
