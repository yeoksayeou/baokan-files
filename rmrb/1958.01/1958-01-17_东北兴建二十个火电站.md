Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 16th. A large-scale power industry construction will be carried out in Northeast China this year to solve the rapidly increasing electricity needs of the Northeast industrial base.

Northeast China has decided to build and expand about twenty thermal power plants this year. After these power plants are completed, the power supply capacity of the Northeast power grid will be greatly strengthened. The largest thermal power plant in China, the Liaoning Power Plant, will complete most of its civil engineering this year, and the installation of power generation equipment can begin next year. In addition to building power plants, Northeast China will also add a batch of mobile train power stations manufactured in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia this year.

Northeast China will also build a number of large-scale power transmission and transformation projects this year. A high-voltage transmission line to be constructed this year will connect the Northeast power grid with the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan (Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan) power grid in North China into a unified power grid, so that power stations in North China can transmit electricity to the power-deficient Northeast.

Since the Northeast industrial base has been basically completed during the first five-year plan period, the industrial electricity consumption in this region has greatly increased. In the past five years, Northeast China has built more than a dozen power plants and further tapped the potential of the original power generation equipment. However, the Northeast power industry is still lagging behind the development of the entire Northeast industry, and the power supply in Northeast China will be relatively tight this year. Based on this situation, the state has decided to accelerate the construction of the Northeast power industry so that the Northeast industrial base can exert greater production potential.

    东北兴建二十个火电站
    新华社沈阳16日电东北地区今年将进行大规模的电力工业建设，以解决东北工业基地激增的用电需要。
    东北地区决定在今年内新建和扩建的火力发电站约有二十个。这批发电站建成后，东北电力网供电能力将大大加强。我国最大的火力发电站——辽宁发电厂今年完成大部分土木建筑工程后，明年就可以开始安装发电设备。除了建设电厂，东北今年还要增加一批苏联和捷克斯洛伐克制造的流动列车发电站。
    东北今年还要建设一批规模较大的送电和变电工程。今年将动工建设的一条高压送电线路，将把东北电力网和华北的京津唐（北京、天津和唐山）电力网联结成统一的电力网，使华北地区的电力站可以向电力不足的东北输送电力。
    由于东北工业基地在第一个五年计划期间已经基本上建成，这个地区的工业用电量已大大增加。过去五年内东北建设了十多个发电站，并且进一步发掘了原有发电设备的潜力，但是东北电力工业仍然落后于东北整个工业的发展，今年东北地区电力供应将比较紧张。国家根据这一情况，决定加速建设东北电力工业，使东北工业基地能发挥更大的生产潜力。
