People Who Persist in Exercising
    ——A Record of the Radio Calisthenics Activities of the Directly Subordinate Organs of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee
    Cao Di
    Among the various organs in Beijing, the radio calisthenics of the directly subordinate organs of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, located in the Fan Jia Hutong building, can be considered one of the better-organized. Every day, among the more than one thousand employees who regularly work in the organs, 80% to 90% participate in the exercises. If you pass by Fan Jia Hutong at 10:30 a.m. or 3:30 p.m., you will see seven or eight hundred people doing radio calisthenics in the open space in front of the directly subordinate organs' building. The rows are neat, and the movements are coordinated. Such a grand occasion is rarely seen elsewhere.
    Before the announcement of the Third Set of Radio Calisthenics, the radio calisthenics in the Fan Jia Hutong Municipal People's Committee's directly subordinate organs' building were already quite good. At that time, some units had not yet moved into the building, and the total number of people was not as large as it is now, but there were still three or four hundred people participating in the exercises every day. However, the grand occasion at that time never lasted long. Many people felt that the first and second sets of radio calisthenics did not involve much exercise, and after doing them for a long time, they felt monotonous. In addition, the organization and supervision and inspection work were not done well enough, so many people practiced intermittently. Between July and October last year, the rectification and anti-rightist movement was very intense, and many people simply stopped participating in the exercises. The once-active Fan Jia Hutong building radio calisthenics basically came to a standstill.
    After all, there are many people who care about their health. After the Third Set of Radio Calisthenics was announced, many people posted big-character posters, demanding the revival of the building's radio calisthenics. The building's club and sports association reorganized with great effort and sent thirteen people to the Beijing Municipal Sports Commission to learn, so they could return to be instructors. The club and sports association also went deep into each unit to mobilize, especially mobilizing the responsible comrades of each unit to participate in the radio calisthenics. At the same time, the club and sports association felt that more inspections of some people would play a supervisory role, so they also, for a certain period, praised the individuals and collectives that did well and criticized the individuals and collectives that did poorly on the blackboard newspaper. This approach yielded good results.
    Radio calisthenics became active again in the Fan Jia Hutong building. Each time the exercises were done, except for sick people and those who were truly unable to leave their work, no one could be found loafing in the office. Many people have made exercising a habit, and if they don't do it at the appointed time, it's like missing an important task. Almost 50% of the responsible comrades of the twenty directly subordinate organs' units in the building actively participate in the exercises. Ma Yingzhong, Director of the Tax Bureau, and Xiao Song, Director of the Supervision Bureau, come every time. Even Ma Xizhi, the sixty-year-old Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, is still vigorous in his old age and insists on exercising every day. Some responsible comrades wanted to exercise but didn't know how, so the club sent special personnel to teach them. These responsible comrades not only actively participated in radio calisthenics activities themselves but also mobilized the employees of their units to participate. Leaders taking the lead in exercising did indeed play a leading role. In the past, some people thought that doing radio calisthenics was "just waving their arms around, not very meaningful," and some people wanted to slack off during the ten minutes of exercise. When these people saw that the responsible comrades attached great importance to radio calisthenics and personally participated in the exercise, they also changed their views on radio calisthenics and insisted on exercising every day.
    Recently, the club and sports association sent letters to the responsible comrades of each unit, thanking them for mobilizing their cadres to actively participate in radio calisthenics exercises. This letter also played a role in hoping that the responsible comrades would continue to take the lead in participating in the exercises in the future.
    The people in the building who participate in the exercises all reflect that the Third Set of Radio Calisthenics involves a large amount of exercise, the movements are relatively complex, it is very energetic to do, and the exercise effect is also good. In particular, some people who practice Taijiquan said that many of the movements in this set of exercises are similar to those in martial arts, and they like them very much. Office cadres sit on benches all day, and doing two outdoor activities every day makes them feel comfortable and full of energy. This is a universal feeling.
    Currently, the building is carrying out a radio calisthenics mobile red flag competition. Every unit wants to keep this red flag, but to keep the red flag forever, it is necessary to actively and conscientiously and persistently participate in radio calisthenics activities.

    坚持锻炼的人们
    ——记北京市人民委员会直属机关的广播操活动
    曹弟
    在北京的各机关来说，住在范家胡同大楼的北京市人民委员会直属机关的广播操算是开展得比较好的一个。每天，经常在机关里工作的一千多职工中，作操的总有80％到90％。当你上午十时半或下午三时半在范家胡同经过时，就会看到直属机关大楼前的空地上有七八百人在作广播操。行列整齐，动作和协，那种盛况在别处真是少见。
    第三套广播操公布以前，范家胡同市人民委员会直属机关大楼的广播操就开展得不坏，那时有些单位还未搬到大楼来，总的人数还没有现在多，可是每天也有三四百人参加作操。但是那时的盛况总是不能久长。很多人感觉第一、二两套广播操运动量不大，作久了又感到单调，再加上组织和督促检查工作做得不够好，所以时练时辍，一曝十寒的人很不少。去年7月到10月间，整风反右派很紧张，很多人干脆就不参加作操了。活跃一时的范家胡同大楼广播操基本上陷于停顿状态。
    毕竟是关心身体健康的人多。在第三套广播操公布后，很多人贴了大字报，要求复活大楼的广播操。大楼的俱乐部和体育协会又重新大力组织，并派十三个人到北京市体委去学习，好回来做领操员。俱乐部和体育协会又深入各单位动员，特别是动员各单位的负责同志来参加广播操。同时俱乐部和体育协会，感到对有些人多检查是会起督促作用的，因此又在一定时期，在黑板报上表扬做得好的个人和集体，批评做得坏的个人和集体。这样做收效不小。
    广播操在范家胡同大楼里又活跃起来。每次作操时，办公室里除去病号和一些确实因为工作离不开的人外，再也找不到偷懒的人了。有不少人作操已做成习惯，到时候不做就好像少干一件要事一样。大楼里二十个直属机关单位的负责同志几乎有50％都积极参加做操。税务局局长马应中、监察局局长萧松等每次都来。就连六十多岁的财政局副局长马溪之也老当益壮，每天坚持作操。有些负责同志想作但不会作，俱乐部就派专人教他们。这些负责同志不但自己积极参加广播操活动，而且也动员自己单位的职工参加。首长带头作操，的确起了带头作用。过去有些人认为作广播操是“比比划划，意思不大”，有些人想在做操的十分钟内偷偷懒。当这些人看到负责同志们都很重视广播操，并亲自参加锻炼，于是自己也改变对广播操的看法，坚持每日作操了。
    最近俱乐部和体育协会向各单位负责同志发了信，感谢他们动员所属干部积极参加广播操锻炼。这封信同时也起了这样的作用，就是：希望负责同志们今后继续带头参加作操。
    大楼里参加作操的人都反映，第三套广播操运动量大，动作比较复杂，做起来很带劲，锻炼效果也好。特别是一些练太极拳的人，说这套操中有不少动作同武术中的动作相似，他们很喜欢。机关干部整天坐板凳，每天作两次户外活动，身体舒畅，精神饱满，这是普遍的感觉。
    目前，大楼正开展广播体操流动红旗竞赛。那个单位都想保持住这面红旗，但是要想永远保持住红旗，那只有积极认真地和坚持不断地来参加广播操活动。
