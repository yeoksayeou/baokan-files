    From Thirty Thousand Households: The Rising Living Standards of the Czechoslovak People
    According to a report in "Prague News," the Czechoslovak State Statistics Bureau has conducted systematic typical surveys of 30,000 households engaged in various occupations in recent years. The materials obtained have proven that the purchasing power and consumption levels of these households have increased in recent years.
    If 1953 is taken as the base number of 100, then the purchasing power of workers, staff, agricultural cooperative members, and individual farmers in these 30,000 households increased as follows:

		1954		1956
  Workers	105.1		118.1
  Staff		107.8		120.5
  Agricultural Co-op Members 114.7		138.9
  Individual Farmers	 90.5		108.8

    In terms of the consumption content of each family, great changes have also taken place in recent years. The proportion of total food expenditure in total family expenditure has gradually decreased, while the proportion of durable goods and other expenditures has increased. This can be illustrated by the following table:

			1953					1956
		Food	Durable Goods and Others	Food	Durable Goods and Others
  Workers	67.4%	32.6%		58.3%	41.7%
  Staff		66.4%	33.6%		57%	43%
  Agricultural Co-op Members	43.1%	56.9%		39.9%	60.1%
  Individual Farmers	46.4%	53.6%		44.3%	55.7%

    From the statistics in the two tables above, it can be seen that agricultural production cooperative member families rank first in terms of both increased purchasing power and increased consumption levels. This is closely related to the development of agricultural collectivization in Czechoslovakia in recent years.

    从三万个家庭看捷克斯洛伐克人民生活水平的提高
    据“布拉格新闻”报道，最近几年来，捷克斯洛伐克国家统计局曾对三万个从事各种不同职业的家庭进行了系统的典型调查。已经获得的材料证明，这些家庭的购买力和消费水平在几年内都有了提高。
    如果以1953年的基数为一百，那么这三万个家庭中的工人、职员、农业合作社社员和个体农民的购买力分别提高如下：
              1954	        1956
  工　人   　一○五·一     一一八·一
  职　员   　一○七·八　   一二○·五
  农业社社员 一一四·七   　一三八·九
  个体农民　 九○·五　    一○八·八
    在各个家庭的消费内容方面，几年来也发生了很大的变化。全部食物开支在家庭总开支中所占的比例已逐渐下降，而耐用品及其他开支所占的比例则有所提高。这从下表可以得到说明：
           1953　                     1956
      食物　耐用品及其他　食物　耐用品及其他
  工　人　67.4％　32.6％　 58.3％　41.7％
  职　员　66.4％　33.6％　57％　43％
  农业社社员　43.1％　56.9％　39.9％　60.1％
  个体农民　46.4％　53.6％　44.3％　55.7％
    从上面两表的统计可以看出，无论在购买力的提高或是消费水平的增长方面，农业生产合作社社员家庭都占第一位。这同近年来捷克斯洛伐克农业合作化的发展有着密切的关系。　（东）
