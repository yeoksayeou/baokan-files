Striving to Both "Cross the Yellow River" and "Leap Over the Yangtze River"
Shimen Song Cooperative in Stone Gate Strives to Become a Thousand-Jin Cooperative This Year

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Shimen Song Agricultural Cooperative in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, known nationally for its pig farming, is correcting its tendency to neglect water conservancy construction and striving to increase production in 1958 from the north bank of the Yellow River to leap over the Yangtze River, becoming a thousand-jin cooperative.

    The Shimen Song Agricultural Cooperative has more than 28,000 mu of arable land. In the past two years, the pig farming industry has developed rapidly. Last year, it raised more than 33,000 pigs, of which more than 14,400 were regularly kept in pens. This cooperative has a large number of pigs and sufficient fertilizer, and the soil quality is not bad. However, due to neglecting water conservancy construction in the past two years, there were only 2,000 mu of irrigated land before the autumn harvest. The land had fertilizer but lacked water, so grain production was not high. In 1956, the grain yield per mu was 383 jin, and last year's yield per mu only increased to 396 jin. After the autumn harvest, the cooperative members, through a great debate on "Why can't grain production leap forward and rise," found the key to increasing production. In the debate, many cooperative members cited production examples to illustrate the importance of "water," enhanced their confidence in vigorously building farmland water conservancy, and criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of the cooperative cadres.

    Next, all cooperative members studied the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and, after repeated discussions, formulated the 1958 production plan. Their slogan is: We must both cross the Yellow River (500 jin) and leap over the Yangtze River (800 jin), striving to become a thousand-jin cooperative. The plan requires that the per-mu yield targets for cotton and peanuts also reach 115 jin and 745 jin respectively. In addition to pig farming, kiln firing, and other sideline income, each cooperative member's average income this year will reach 138.7 yuan (including grain, firewood, and household sideline income).

    Currently, 60% of the male labor force in this cooperative has organized well-digging teams, with specific divisions of labor, working in shifts day and night. Cooperative members have invested more than 24,000 yuan and more than 400,000 bricks. The entire cooperative has already completed 323 new wells and dug 600 well curb frames. It is estimated that the task of digging 1,000 wells can be completed around the Spring Festival. The remaining 40% of the male labor force and the female labor force have actively invested in activities such as turning sand, pressing alkali, leveling land and repairing ridges, and accumulating fertilizer, making fertilizer, and winter wheat field management.

### 既要“渡黄河”又要“跨长江”  石门宋社争取今年成为千斤社

    既要“渡黄河”又要“跨长江”
    石门宋社争取今年成为千斤社
    新华社讯　以养猪多而闻名全国的山东省阳谷县石门宋农业社，纠正忽视水利建设的偏向，争取1958年产量由黄河北岸跃过长江，成为千斤社。
    石门宋农业社共有可耕地二万八千多亩，近两年来，养猪业飞跃发展，去年养了三万三千多头猪，其中经常圈存一万四千四百多头。这个社养猪多、肥料充足，土质也不坏，但是由于近两年来忽视水利建设，秋前只有二千亩水浇地，土地有肥料缺水，因此粮食产量不高。1956年粮食亩产量为三百八十三斤，去年的亩产量仅上升到三百九十六斤。秋收以后社员们通过“为什么粮食产量不能跃进上升”的大辩论，找到了增产关键。在辩论中，许多社员引用了生产实例说明“水”的重要，增强了大力兴修农田水利的信心，批判了社干部的右倾保守思想。
    接着，全体社员学习了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），经过多次讨论制订了1958年的生产规划。他们的口号是：既要渡黄河（五百斤）又要跨长江（八百斤），争取成为千斤社。规划要求棉花、花生的亩产量指标也分别达到一百一十五斤和七百四十五斤，加上养猪、烧窑及其他副业收入，每个社员今年平均收入将达一百三十八点七元（包括粮柴和家庭副业收入）。
    现在，这个社60％的男劳力组织了打井队伍，具体分工，日夜轮作。社员投资已达二万四千多元，投砖四十多万块。全社已打成新井三百二十三眼，挖好井筒框六百个，估计春节前后即可完成打井一千眼的任务。其余40％的男劳力和妇女劳力已积极投入翻沙、压碱、整地修畦和积肥、造肥、冬季麦田管理等项活动。
