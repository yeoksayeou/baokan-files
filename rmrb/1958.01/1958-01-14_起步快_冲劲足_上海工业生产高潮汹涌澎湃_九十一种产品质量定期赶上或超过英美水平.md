Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 13th (Xinhua Reporter Xu Zhongni): Shanghai's industrial sector, with its one million workers, has made an extremely fast start and is displaying immense momentum at the starting line of the Second Five-Year Plan. In the mere ten days since the city's advanced producers' New Year's Day celebration issued a new call for competition, a surging new production upsurge has formed in various industries. Worker representative conferences or worker symposiums for various trades are being held everywhere to discuss the competition proposals of advanced factories and formulate guarantees for participating in the competition. Production reports of breaking new quotas and creating new records are constantly emerging. Many factories are also paying special attention to improving product quality. Concrete measures have been formulated for ninety-one brands of industrial products across the city to catch up with or surpass similar products in countries like Britain and the United States in terms of quality within periods of two years, five years, etc. The entire movement has been launched more quickly and extensively than any previous production upsurge.

The slogan proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "Strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years," has elicited a particularly sensitive and strong response from Shanghai workers, who possess a rich revolutionary tradition. In the process of deliberating on new competition targets, many factory workers have eagerly sought out engineers and enterprise leaders to inquire about British production levels and the comparison between their factory's products and similar British products. The first question many workers ask when they meet is: "Comrade, what practical actions are you taking to surpass Britain?"

At a recent worker representative conference at the Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant, when the factory director mentioned in his production plan that the output of billets in the first branch plant would increase by 700 tons this year, a dispatcher immediately submitted a note stating that production could be increased by 4,000 tons. He had successfully tested an improved technological measure last year, guaranteeing that this could be achieved. Workers in Shanghai's steel sector are actively thinking of ways to increase steel production, in order to catch up with Britain alongside fraternal factories and mines across the country. The leaders of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, which is expanding a new steelmaking workshop, have submitted a new plan to higher authorities, proposing to build new furnaces and keep the old ones, installing continuous casting equipment, and producing an additional 200,000 tons of steel annually with minimal investment. The chemical, machinery, textile, and light industrial sectors are all revising plans to increase output and develop varieties, and are about to mobilize the masses to discuss them. Based on the revolutionary vigor displayed by the masses during the current upsurge, it is estimated that many targets will be broken during the discussions.

The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, which first proposed a competition initiative at the New Year's Day celebration, already has thirty workers, including advanced producers Sheng Li, Zhu Daxian, and outstanding apprentice Chen Desheng, who have each formulated personal "mini-Five-Year Plans" to complete five years' worth of work in three or four years. Eight workshops and nine work sections/“groups” have already formulated competition guarantees.

The Great China Rubber Factory, which proposed surpassing the quality of the famous British "Dunlop" tire with its Double Coin brand tire in five years on New Year's Day, saw the percentage of tires with forming defects within 6 millimeters rise from 97.03% at the end of the year to 98.05% in the first five days of the new year. The female workers of the fifth work area of the fine yarn workshop of the State-owned No. 5 Cotton Mill, which initiated a textile factory competition on New Year's Day, achieved their competition target of reducing yarn defects by 50% on the 6th.

After the Great China Rubber Factory proposed a competition initiative to catch up with the British "Dunlop" tire with the Double Coin brand tire in five years, the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, which won the quality competition last year, followed up with a guarantee to catch up with the Double Happiness brand tire in four years. Such competitions have unfolded in various industries. In ten days, nearly one hundred factories and ninety-one brands of products have proposed targets, and even more factories and products will be投入/involved in the competition. The vast majority of the competition targets have undergone repeated discussions, and measures for achieving them have been formulated. Engineering and technical personnel are poring over technical data from Britain and the United States late into the night. Shanghai's science and technology library and the technical data rooms of various units are particularly busy now, and commercial departments are rushing to provide actual samples of British and American products. British brands like Dunlop tires, Raleigh bicycles, and Crown tools are being analyzed and dissected, with their quality, cost, and technology being compared to domestic products. Areas where they are inferior are being studied for improvement measures, and even for those already surpassed, better products from other countries are being sought as competition targets. Engineers from the Great China factory reported their analysis and comparison results to the workers, identifying four shortcomings in the quality of Double Coin tires compared to "Dunlop" and proposing four corresponding measures, analyzing the six conditions for catching up with and surpassing them within five years, further boosting the workers' confidence. The factory's technical personnel and veteran workers are now preparing to organize twenty special research groups to carry out technical and technological improvement work.

In order to comprehensively organize the new production upsurge, the various industrial departments in charge and industrial trade unions have arranged a series of activities. Exhibitions and exchange meetings for new products and advanced experiences will soon be held, and symposiums for veteran workers, young workers, and technical personnel will be convened. The first and second batches of factories where the rectification campaign has entered the systemic rectification phase are intensifying efforts to streamline institutions and transfer cadres to lower levels, so that the management and political work of enterprises can adapt to the new situation of the production upsurge. The third batch of more than four hundred factories, which recently began rectification, has quickly formed a high tide of "big airing and big contending." The masses of workers are eagerly demanding that leading cadres earnestly rectify and quickly organize the production upsurge.

    起步快  冲劲足
    上海工业生产高潮汹涌澎湃
    九十一种产品质量定期赶上或超过英美水平
    据新华社上海13日电　新华社记者徐中尼报道：上海工业部门一百万职工在第二个五年计划的赛跑起点上，起步极快，冲劲十分猛烈。从全市先进生产者元旦庆祝大会发出新的竞赛号召以后，只有十多天，在各行业中已经形成了汹涌澎湃的生产新高潮。到处都在召开职工代表大会或各工种工人座谈会，讨论先进厂的竞赛倡议，制订参加竞赛的保证条件；到处传出了突破新定额、创造新纪录的生产捷报。许多工厂还特别注意提高产品质量，全市有九十一种牌号的工业品，分别订出了以两年、五年等为期在质量方面赶上或超过英美等国同类产品的具体措施。整个运动比过去任何一次生产高潮发动得都更迅速更广泛。
    中共中央提出的“争取十五年后钢铁和其他重要工业品在产量方面赶上或者超过英国”的口号，对于富有革命传统的上海工人，反应特别敏感、强烈。各厂职工在酝酿新的竞赛指标的过程中，许多人都急切地找工程师、企业领导人询问英国的生产水平，以及本厂产品和英国同类产品的对比情况。不少职工见面后的第一句问话就是：“同志，你拿甚么实际行动来赶过英国？”
    在上海第二钢厂最近召开的职工代表大会上，当厂长报告生产计划时提到第一分厂开坯产量今年要增加七百吨的时候，一个调度员立即递上条子，说可以增产四千吨。原来他在去年已经试验成功一种改进工艺的措施，保证可以达到。上海钢铁部门职工都在积极想办法增加钢的产量，要同全国兄弟厂矿一道，迎头赶上英国。正在扩建新的炼钢车间的上海第一钢厂的领导人，又向上级提出一个新方案，准备另建新炉、不拆旧炉，安装连续铸锭设备，在投资很少的条件下，每年再多炼二十万吨钢。化学、机械、纺织和轻工业各部门都在修订增加产量、发展品种的规划和今年的生产计划，就要发动群众讨论。根据当前群众在高潮中表现的革命干劲，估计许多指标都将在讨论中被突破。
    在元旦庆祝大会上最先提出竞赛倡议的上海机床厂，已经有先进生产者盛利、朱大仙和优秀艺徒陈德胜等三十个工人分别订出了在三年、四年内完成五年工作量的个人“小五年计划”，已经有八个车间、九个工段“小组”订出了竞赛保证。
    在元旦提出双钱牌轮胎质量在五年内超过英国名牌“邓禄普”的大中华橡胶厂，新年开头五天，成型差级在六公厘以内的轮胎，已经从年底前的97.03％提高到98.05％。在元旦发起纺织厂竞赛的国棉五厂细纱车间第五工区女工提出的纱疵减少50％的竞赛指标，在6日已经达到。
    当大中华橡胶厂提出双钱牌轮胎五年赶上英国“邓禄普”的竞赛倡议后，在去年质量竞赛中取得优胜的正泰橡胶厂，接着提出回力牌轮胎四年赶上的保证。各行业都展开了这样的竞赛，十天中就有近百个厂、九十一种牌号的产品提出了指标，还有更多的厂和产品，将要投入竞赛。竞赛的指标，绝大多数经过了反复的讨论，制订了实现的措施。工程技术人员连夜查阅英美各国的技术资料，上海的科技图书馆和各单位的技术资料室现在是格外的忙碌，商业部门也赶忙提供英美产品的实样。英国名牌邓禄普轮胎、蓝苓自行车、皇冠工具……都在被分析、解剖，同本厂的产品比质量、比成本、比工艺。不及的地方，就研究改进的措施，已经胜过的还要找其他国家更好的产品，作比赛的对象。大中华厂的工程师把分析对比的情况向职工们作了报告，针对双钱牌质量不及“邓禄普”的四点，提出了四项措施，分析了在五年内赶上和超过的六个条件，更加鼓舞了职工的信心。现在这个厂技术人员和老工人准备组织二十个专题研究小组，展开改进技术和工艺的工作。
    为了把新的生产高潮全面组织起来，各工业主管部门和产业工会已经安排了一系列的活动。不久将分别举办新产品和先进经验的展览交流会，召开老工人、青年工人和技术人员的座谈会。整风运动已经进入系统整改的第一、二两批工厂，正在加紧进行精简机构、干部下放的工作，使企业的管理工作和政治工作适应生产高潮的新形势；最近开始整风的第三批四百多个厂，已经迅速形成大放大鸣的高潮，职工群众迫切要求领导干部认真整改并迅速把生产高潮组织起来。
