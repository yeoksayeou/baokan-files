Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, January 15th: The Daoxian County Health and Epidemic Prevention Station in Hunan Province used *Artemisia annua* to treat 31 patients with tertian malaria, 10 patients with malignant malaria, and 2 patients with mixed infections of tertian and malignant malaria from July to October last year. Thirty-one patients saw their malaria symptoms disappear one to four days after taking the medicine. According to observations on the disappearance of malarial parasites in 17 malaria patients, malarial parasites completely disappeared in 13 patients. According to a three-month follow-up of 31 patients whose symptoms disappeared, only four relapsed. Among the 43 people treated above, only one experienced dizziness as a side effect after taking *Artemisia annua*. This epidemic prevention station plans to continue testing and observation. In 1956, Qiu Guangsheng, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner at the Hengyang Special District Malaria Prevention and Treatment Station, proposed using the economically convenient *Artemisia annua* to treat malaria. He dried the *Artemisia annua*, removed the stems, kept the leaves, ground them into powder, and made them into pills the size of mung beans using the method of making traditional Chinese medicine pills. He treated more than 40 malaria patients the year before last, with good results, but did not summarize the results. After July last year, the Daoxian County Health and Epidemic Prevention Station continued this experiment, and increased the dosage from 1 to 2 grams per day for adults last year to 2 to 3 grams per day (not contraindicated for pregnant women), taken three to four hours before the onset of symptoms, once a day for four consecutive days, achieving the above-mentioned efficacy.

    用青蒿治疗疟疾有效
    新华社长沙15日电　湖南省道县卫生防疫站去年7月到10月，用青蒿治疗了间日疟患者三十一人，恶性疟患者十人和间日疟与恶性疟混合感染患者二人，服药一天到四天后，有三十一个病人消失了疟疾症状。根据对十七个疟疾患者疟原虫消失情况的观察：有十三人疟原虫完全消失。根据对三十一个症状消失的病人在三个月内的追查，只有四人复发。上述治疗的四十三人中，只有一人在服青蒿后发生头昏的副作用。这个防疫站准备继续试验和观察。1956年衡阳专区疟疾防治站中医师丘广生创议用经济便利的青蒿治疗疟疾，将青蒿晒干去梗留叶，研成粉末，照中药制丸子的方法制成绿豆大小的丸子，在前年治疗了四十多个疟疾患者，效果很好，但未总结。去年7月后，道县卫生防疫站又继续进行了这种试验，并将剂量由去年的成年人日用一到二克增为二到三克（孕妇不忌），在症状发作前三到四小时内服用，一日一次，连服四日，便取得上述功效。
