Why does Huangjiu (yellow wine) turn sour after being left out for a long time?

    Huangjiu that has just been bought will develop a vinegary sour taste after only a few days, and it sours even faster in hot weather. Why is this? It turns out that there are bacteria called acetic acid bacteria that often float in the air. When these acetic acid bacteria fall into the Huangjiu, they multiply rapidly and cause acetic acid fermentation. As a result, the alcohol in the Huangjiu is fermented into acetic acid, and the wine becomes sour. However, acetic acid bacteria can only survive in relatively diluted alcohol solutions. If the alcohol content is high, the acetic acid bacteria will be killed. Therefore, spirits, brandy, and other liquors do not turn sour. (Liu Youchang)

    黄酒放久了为什么变酸？
    新买来的黄酒，放不了几天就会有醋的酸味，天气热的时候，酸得更快。这是为什么呢？原来空气中时常漂浮有一类称做醋母菌的细菌，当这类醋母菌落到黄酒中以后，便大量繁殖，引起醋酸发酵，结果就将黄酒中的酒精发酵成醋酸了，酒也就变酸了。但是，醋母菌只能在较稀的酒精液中生活，如果酒精含量较高时，醋母菌就被杀死了，所以烧酒、白兰地酒等不会变酸。（刘有常）
