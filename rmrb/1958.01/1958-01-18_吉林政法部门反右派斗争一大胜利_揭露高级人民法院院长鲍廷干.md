Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 17th: Jilin Province's political and legal departments have held more than twenty meetings in the past month to expose and criticize Bao Tinggan, the president of the Jilin Provincial Higher People's Court and secretary of the Party Group of the Jilin Provincial Higher People's Court, for his bourgeois rightist words and deeds.

Rightist Bao Tinggan denied the Communist Party's leading role in state affairs and distorted the nature of our country's political power, saying that "the Communist Party does not hold a leading position over the democratic parties," but rather "plays a role of mutual restriction." He also claimed that the purpose of our people's democratic dictatorship was to "enable the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and landlord class elements to obtain equal rights in the future." He praised the British bourgeois political system and even, with insane arrogance, compared Japanese imperialist aggression to the people's dictatorship, saying that Japanese imperialism's oppression of the Chinese people failed simply because "the dictatorship was too strict."

Bao Tinggan attacked our judicial departments for "having no laws to follow" or "not following the laws," slandering our legal system as incomplete and saying that citizens committed crimes because there were no laws. He cursed the judicial organs for having "too many war habits, killing when they say kill, releasing when they say release, and people's courts often make wrong judgments, wrongly accusing good people." Bao Tinggan also attempted to tamper with the nature of the judicial organs, belittling the dictatorship role of the people's courts, and reducing the public security and procuratorial organs to an equal footing with criminals, saying that these two dictatorship organs were "litigating against each other," and that the accusations made by the public security and procuratorial organs could be disbelieved, with the final decision on who wins and who loses being made by the court's judges. He arbitrarily reversed the relationship between the public security, procuratorial organs, and the court, saying that the mutual restriction of these three organs was only to avoid "infringing on citizens' rights" and "wronging good people," without mentioning that the three organs should mutually support and cooperate under the premise of consistently exercising dictatorship over the enemy.

Rightist Bao Tinggan vigorously promoted the superiority of the bourgeois lawyer system among lawyers, slandering Communist Party members as being inferior to old judicial personnel, complaining that they could not represent the thoughts and feelings of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and other criminal elements. He shamelessly said, "Serve whoever you are handling the case for," and "You must serve the criminals well." Bao Tinggan also openly incited lawyers to fight against the procuratorate and the court, saying that "disputes are inevitable, and you cannot be peaceful if you want to be a lawyer." He allowed lawyers to help defendants appeal, saying that in general, appeals might lead to reduced sentences.

Rightist Bao Tinggan slandered judicial reform, opposed thoroughly eliminating old legal viewpoints in the people's courts, and denied the achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. He was very interested in reviewing "wrong judgments" and personally visited twenty-eight so-called "masses" (some of whom were prisoners) in the Yanbian area. After returning, he shouted that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement had gone wrong, saying that it had caused "widespread complaints and dissatisfaction."

In handling cases and guiding work, Bao Tinggan one-sidedly emphasized the "benefit-of-the-doubt for the defendant" theory and the "presumption of innocence" theory, advocating that no matter what the case, even if the facts of the crime are clear and the evidence is conclusive, one should not consider it a crime before the judgment, but rather consider it innocent. When punishing crimes, he advocated finding all kinds of excuses to consider the defendant's interests, exonerating and mitigating the defendant's guilt. Under the guidance of this absurd ideology, some case handlers in the provincial court continuously failed to fulfill their duties, thereby treating the guilty as innocent, the serious crime as a minor crime, and wrongly releasing and missing a batch of counter-revolutionaries and other criminal elements. Among the 193 appealed and appealed cases that have been reviewed, there were 60 cases where the judgments were improperly changed. At the same time, many cases of heavy crimes being lightly sentenced and cases that should have been sentenced but were not were also discovered.

Bao Tinggan has consistently resisted the Communist Party's leadership over the court. He slandered the Party committee's leadership as being amateurish, fabricated contradictions between the Party committee's leadership and the independence of judicial work, described the Party's leadership as interference, and wanted to completely get rid of the Party's leadership. Therefore, in recent years, he has rarely asked the provincial Party committee for instructions or reported to them in his work. He even handled some major issues of principle on his own. When the provincial judicial conference last year arranged for the review of wrong judgments, he did not submit a plan for implementation to the provincial Party committee. Instead, he violated the central government's instructions and used the new lenient policy standards to wrongly review and handle the suppression of counter-revolutionaries cases in 1955, resulting in the wrongful release of a large number of criminals. All reports reviewed and approved by Bao Tinggan never mentioned the Party committee's leadership, and he openly asked the lower courts not to write about the Party committee's leadership in their summary reports. He also openly said that the criticism of right-leaning in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1955 was a "twelfth-grade typhoon," and clamored that "in the future, he would grow horns" and "be able to withstand it."

When the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered Bao Tinggan's serious bourgeois thinking, it criticized and struggled against him several times. However, Bao Tinggan not only did not accept criticism and correct his mistakes, but also, as the secretary of the Party Group of the court, convened four Party Group meetings and one rectification leadership group meeting in a row to discuss countermeasures and resist criticism. He believed that this was not enough to get through, so he designated someone to deal with the criticisms from the provincial Party committee and various places, looking for all kinds of reasons to push them back. At the same time, he looked for some people to estimate the "future" and the next steps. When some people proposed checking the work, he was afraid that checking the work would further expose his crimes, so he directly stopped them. On the one hand, he went everywhere to find out the leadership's intentions, and on the other hand, he deliberately spread rumors saying, "The court sometimes has right and sometimes has left," and "As soon as the movement comes, the court must be rectified first." Bao Tinggan even played all kinds of despicable tricks, attempting to resist the criticism of the provincial Party committee.

It is not accidental that Bao Tinggan embarked on the road of anti-Party and anti-socialism and became a despicable and shameful traitor. He was born into an old military officer's family. Although he participated in the revolution for more than twenty years, his thinking has not been fundamentally transformed. In a peaceful environment, his serious bourgeois personal fame and gain thinking has also grown anew. Especially in the past one or two years, his revolutionary will has declined, he has become tired of Party life, and he is unwilling to attend Party meetings, let alone contact the masses and reality, and he is obsessed with writing articles and books, spreading his decadent ideas. He finally completely degenerated into a shameful bourgeois rightist.

The cadres of the Jilin Provincial Court held twenty-four consecutive meetings in one month to criticize Bao Tinggan's rightist words and deeds. The Second Session of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Jilin Province systematically and fully exposed and criticized the anti-Party words and deeds of rightist Bao Tinggan. In the face of a large number of facts and sufficient reasoning, Bao Tinggan had no choice but to bow his head and admit his guilt.

    吉林政法部门反右派斗争一大胜利
    揭露高级人民法院院长鲍廷干
    新华社长春17日电　吉林省政法部门在近一个月来连续召开了二十多次会议，揭露和批判吉林省高级人民法院院长、中共吉林省高级人民法院党组书记鲍廷干的资产阶级右派言行。
    右派分子鲍廷干否定共产党在国家事务中的领导地位，并且歪曲我国政权的性质，说是“共产党对各民主党派不是居于领导地位”，而是“起互相制约的作用”，我国人民民主专政的目的是为了“将来会使官僚资产阶级和地主阶级分子，获得平等的权利”。他赞扬英国的资产阶级政治制度，甚至丧心病狂地把日本帝国主义的侵略和人民的专政相提并论，说日本帝国主义压迫中国人民只是因为“专政太严”所以失败了。
    鲍廷干攻击我国司法部门“无法可依”或“有法不依”，污蔑我国法制不够完备，说是公民犯了罪是因为没有法造成的。他咒骂司法机关“战争习气较多，说杀就杀，说放即放，人民法院往往发生错案，冤枉好人”。鲍廷干还企图篡改司法机关的性质，贬低人民法院的专政作用，并把公安、检察机关降低到和罪犯平等地位，说这两个专政机关同罪犯是彼此“对面打官司”，公安、检察机关提出罪状可以不信，到底谁胜谁败，最后由法院审判人员判决。他任意颠倒公安、检察机关和法院的关系，说这三个机关的互相制约作用，仅仅是为了避免“侵犯公民权利”和“冤枉好人”，而不提三个机关在一致对敌人专政的前提下互相支援，通力合作。
    右派分子鲍廷干在律师中大肆宣扬资产阶级律师制度的优越，污蔑共产党员不如旧法人员，嫌他们代表不了地主、富农、反革命分子及其他刑事犯罪分子的思想情感。他公然无耻地说：“为谁办案就应忠实地为谁服务”，“要为犯罪分子好好干”。鲍廷干并公然煽动律师向检察院、法院进行斗争，说什么“纠纷是不可避免的，要当律师就不能和平。”他让律师帮助被告上诉，说在一般情况下，上诉可能减刑。
    右派分子鲍廷干污蔑司法改革，反对在人民法院中彻底清除旧法观点，否认肃反成绩。他对检查“错案”抱着很大的兴趣，曾亲自到延边地区访问了二十八名所谓“群众”（其中有一些是犯人），回来以后就叫喊肃反运动搞错了，说肃反弄得“怨声载道，一片不满之声”。
    鲍廷干在办案和指导工作中，片面地强调“有利被告”论和“无罪推定”论，主张无论对什么案件，即使犯罪事实清楚，证据确凿，在判决前也不能认为犯罪，而要认为无罪。在惩罚犯罪时，他主张要找出种种借口，从对被告有利方面考虑，为被告开脱和减轻罪责。在他这种荒谬思想指导下，省法院一些办案人员连续失职，从而把有罪当成无罪，重罪当成轻罪，错放并漏掉了一批反革命分子和其他刑事犯罪分子。在已经检查的一百九十三起上诉和申诉案件中，就有改判不当的六十件，同时还发现了很多重罪轻判、该判不判的案件。
    鲍廷干一贯抗拒共产党对法院的领导，他污蔑党委领导是外行，?造党委领导和司法业务独立有矛盾，把党的领导说成是干涉，想完全摆脱党的领导。因此几年来他在工作中很少向省委请示报告，甚至有些带原则性的重大问题，他也擅自处理。去年全省司法会议布置检查错案时，他没有向省委提出贯彻执行的方案，反而违背中央指示，以新的从宽的政策标准，错误地去检查处理1955年的肃反案件，以致错放了大批的罪犯。凡是经鲍廷干审批的报告，从不提及党委领导，他并且公开要下级法院在写总结报告时，不要写党委领导。他还公开地说1955年批评肃反右倾是“十二级台风”，扬言“今后要长角”，要“顶得住”。
    当中共吉林省委会发现鲍廷干的严重资产阶级思想时，曾对他进行过数次批评和斗争，但是鲍廷干不仅不接受批评，改正错误，反而以法院党组书记的身份，连续召开四次党组会议和一次整风领导小组会议，商量对策，抗拒批评。他认为这样还不能混过去，又指定专人对付来自省委和各地的批评，寻找一切理由顶回去。同时找一些人估计“前途”和下一步的做法。当有的人提议检查工作时，他怕检查工作会进一步暴露他的罪行，竟直接加以阻挠。他一面到处摸底，打听领导意图，一面故意放风说：“法院什么时候有右也有左”，“运动一来先得把法院整整。”鲍廷干甚至还玩弄种种卑劣手段，企图对抗省委的批评。
    鲍廷干走上反党反社会主义的道路，成为卑鄙可耻的叛徒，并不是偶然的。他出身于旧军官家庭，虽然参加革命二十多年，但是思想并没有得到根本的改造，在和平环境中，严重的资产阶级个人名利思想又有了新的滋长，尤其是近一、二年来，革命意志衰退，厌倦党的生活，对党的会议也不愿参加，更不愿接触群众和实际，一味沉醉于写文章、著书，散布他的腐朽思想。终于完全堕落成为可耻的资产阶级右派分子。
    吉林省法院干部曾在一个月中连续召开二十四次会议，批判鲍廷干的右派言行。中共吉林省第一届代表大会第二次会议，更对右派分子鲍廷干的反党言行，进行了系统的、充分的揭露与批判。鲍廷干在大量的事实和充分的道理面前，不得不低头认罪。
