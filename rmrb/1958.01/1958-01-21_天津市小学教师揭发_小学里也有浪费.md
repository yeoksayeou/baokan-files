People's Daily Special Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Tianjin primary school teachers, in the midst of the Great Blooming and Letting Contend, have listed many facts and forcefully answered incorrect claims such as "Are there any 'profits' to be saved in primary schools?" and "Primary schools are small in scale and have little funding, so there can't be much waste."

During the airing of views, many people revealed that there is shocking waste in the construction of school buildings in many primary schools. For example, the No. 5 Branch of the Railway Workers' Children's Primary School spent more than 20,000 yuan to build a new school building at the end of the year before last, which has not been used for more than a year. Because no one is looking after it, the beautiful classrooms and offices have become boxing practice rooms for nearby amateur sports enthusiasts and toilets for pedestrians. More than 100 of the more than 300 panes of glass in the classrooms and offices have been damaged. The person in charge of Zhongying Primary School, in order to pursue the splendor of the school building's exterior, used 1,000 to 2,000 yuan of funds without the approval of higher authorities to repaint the school building. Yu Huang Ge Primary School spent more than 1,500 yuan to build a toilet with only five pits.

The teachers also revealed that many schools blindly purchase furniture and teaching aids, and poor management of these things has caused great waste. A teacher at Ximen Nandajie Primary School pointed out that the school built a new building and did not want the old desks and chairs that were still usable, so they bought a complete set of new desks and chairs. In order to carry out extracurricular activities, Jiuxian Shu Hou Primary School spent more than 200 yuan to buy a large group of goats, rabbits, pigeons, chickens, ducks, etc., but because no one took care of them, the result was that "those that could fly flew away, those that could run ran away, and those that could die died." Many people also revealed that the Municipal Education Bureau issued a natural science teaching equipment survey form to various schools in 1956, which listed more than 40 kinds of teaching aids, such as various machine models, human body models, and plant and animal specimens, requiring all schools to be fully equipped. Some schools bought many teaching aids that were not needed at all in teaching and had to be stockpiled in storage rooms.

### 天津市小学教师揭发  小学里也有浪费

    天津市小学教师揭发
    小学里也有浪费
    本报特约新华社专稿　天津市的小学教师们，在大鸣大放中列举了许多事实，对“小学里有没有节约的‘油水’”、“小学规模不大，经费不多，不会有什么浪费”等等不正确的说法做了有力的回答。
    在鸣放中，不少人揭发出：许多小学在校舍的建设方面存在着惊人的浪费。如铁路职工子弟第五小学分校前年年底花了二万多元新建的校舍，一年多来，一直没有使用。因为无人看管，漂亮的教室和办公室变成附近业余体育爱好者的练拳房和行人的厕所。教室和办公室的三百多块玻璃，已经损坏了一百多块。中营小学的负责人为了追求校舍外表的华丽，没有得到上级的批准，擅自动用了一、二千元经费把校舍油漆一新。玉皇阁小学用一千五百多元修建一座只有五个坑的厕所。
    教师们还揭发，由于许多学校盲目的购买家具、教具和对这些东西保管不好，造成很大浪费。西门南大街小学的教师指出：学校新建了楼房，就不要还能用的旧桌椅了，买了全套新桌椅。旧县署后小学为了开展课外活动，花了二百多元买来山羊、兔子、鸽子、鸡、鸭等一大群，因为没人照管，结果“飞的飞、跑的跑、死的死”。许多人还揭露，市教育局在1956年曾向各学校发出自然课教具设备调查表，上面开列了各种机器模型、人体模型和动植物标本等教具四十多种，要各学校一律配齐。有些学校买来许多教具，在教学中根本用不着，只好积压在储藏室里。
