Sofia Dispatch: On the eve of the New Year 1958, Bulgarian First Deputy Prime Minister R. Damyanoff met with reporters and answered questions about the current international situation and Sino-Bulgarian friendship and cooperation. The full text of the Q&A is as follows:

Q: We are on the eve of the New Year 1958. What do you think are the characteristics of the international situation in 1957? What are the prospects for 1958?

A: The characteristics of the international situation in 1957 are: on the one hand, the tremendous growth of world socialism and peace-loving forces, and on the other hand, the serious failure of the policies of aggression and reactionary forces. In 1957, the balance of power between capitalist and socialist countries rapidly shifted in favor of socialist countries. The conclusions made during the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution show that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has made tremendous achievements in politics, economy, culture, and science. For the people of all countries, the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system is becoming increasingly clear. Socialism is on the rise, and capitalism is in an unstoppable decline. The meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of all countries held in Moscow and its historically significant documents vividly demonstrated the rock-solid unity between communist and workers' parties of all countries and the increasing strength of the international communist movement. The peace-loving policy of the socialist camp and communist and workers' parties of all countries embodied in the two declarations of the Moscow meeting has been widely responded to by all mankind; and the world's reactionaries' attempts to split the socialist camp, undermine the unity between communist and workers' parties of all countries, and create ideological confusion in the ranks of communist and workers' parties by encouraging revisionist elements have failed. The world's peace-loving and progressive forces have stopped the US imperialist group's acts of aggression against the freedom and independence of the people of the Middle East countries. Most Arab countries have rejected the colonialist "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine." The American-Turkish plan to invade Syria has been condemned. Now it is difficult for the imperialist aggressive forces to push the people of all countries towards a new world war. The vigilance of world public opinion is constantly increasing. The fact that some famous activists and huge social organizations in capitalist countries such as Britain, France, Italy, West Germany, and the United States insist on accepting the wise and practical suggestions made by the Soviet Union for the sake of maintaining peace convincingly proves this point. Even the NATO meeting in Paris could not remain silent about the Soviet Union's suggestions. Whether the rulers of the imperialist forces are willing or not, this meeting discussed the Soviet Union's suggestions under the pressure of public opinion. It can be said with full confidence that in 1958 the forces of socialism and peace will continue to strengthen and achieve new successes, and the reactionary and aggressive forces will suffer new failures.

Q: How do you evaluate the development of friendship and brotherly cooperation between the people of China and Bulgaria in the past year? What do you think are the prospects for further development of this friendship and cooperation in 1958?

A: In the past 1957, great achievements were made in further consolidating and developing the brotherly friendship and cooperation between the people of Bulgaria and China. The visit of the Bulgarian government delegation headed by A. Yugov to China was of particular importance in this regard. The tremendous construction completed by the Chinese people, the political maturity of the Chinese Communist Party, and the brilliance of its leadership headed by Comrade Mao Zedong left a strong and unforgettable impression on our delegation. The visit of our government delegation to China and the visit of the Chinese National People's Congress delegation headed by Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, to Bulgaria are vivid manifestations of the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Bulgaria. It shows the firm and unwavering will of the people of China and Bulgaria to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. In 1957, the economic ties between our two countries greatly expanded. This fact eloquently illustrates this point: the volume of trade between Bulgaria and China is now more than three times greater than in 1952, when the first trade agreement between the two countries was signed. Scientific and technological and cultural cooperation has also expanded. Many scientists, writers, and artists from both countries have exchanged visits. 1958 has even broader prospects for further developing the friendship and all-round cooperation between our two countries. The Bulgarian government and all the Bulgarian people are happily looking forward to the visit of the government delegation of the People's Republic of China to Bulgaria. They are convinced that this visit will be another contribution to strengthening our friendship and cooperation and consolidating world peace. The Bulgarian parliamentary delegation will also visit the People's Republic of China. This visit will also contribute to establishing more friendly ties between the people of our two countries. The Bulgarian people particularly cherish the friendship with the great Chinese people. They are proud that the Chinese people are their sincere friends. The people of China and Bulgaria are linked by common interests, common goals, and common ideals.

Q: As the New Year 1958 is approaching, what wishes do you have for the Chinese people?

A: The Bulgarian people wholeheartedly congratulate the fraternal Chinese people on not only completing but also over fulfilling the great transformation tasks stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan of the People's China proposed by the Chinese Communist Party. This will further promote the development of national productive forces, more rapidly improve the material and cultural welfare of the Chinese working people, and further enhance the role and significance of the People's Republic of China, which is an inspiring example for all countries suffering from colonial oppression and an indispensable great force in resolving international issues. The Bulgarian people wholeheartedly congratulate the Chinese people on liberating Taiwan more quickly. At that time, the Chinese people's precious ideal—seeing the motherland completely liberated from imperialist enslavement—will become a reality.

    保中友谊有着更加广泛的前景
    保加利亚部长会议第一副主席达米扬诺夫答本报记者问
　　本报索非亚专电　1958年新年前夕，保加利亚部长会议第一副主席拉·达米扬诺夫接见记者，并回答了记者提出的一些有关目前国际局势和中保友谊及合作的问题。问答全文如下：
    问：我们正处在1958年新年前夕，你认为1957年国际局势的特点是什么？1958年的前景如何？
    答：1957年国际局势的特点是：一方面是世界社会主义和爱好和平力量的巨大增长，另一方面是侵略和反动势力政策的严重失败。1957年资本主义国家和社会主义国家力量对比迅速地改变为有利于社会主义国家。庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年时所作出的结论表明，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国，在政治、经济和文化科学方面都取得了巨大成就。对各国人民说来，社会主义制度优越于资本主义制度是越来越清楚了。社会主义在上升，资本主义在不可遏止地衰退。在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议及其所通过的具有历史意义的文件，鲜明地显示了各国共产党和工人党之间坚如磐石的团结及国际共产主义运动力量的日益增长。社会主义阵营及世界各国共产党和工人党的体现在莫斯科会议两个宣言中的爱好和平的政策，受到全人类的广泛响应；而世界反动派企图分裂社会主义阵营，破坏各国共产党和工人党之间的团结，以及用鼓励修正主义分子的办法在共产党和工人党的队伍里制造思想混乱的阴谋遭到了失败。世界爱好和平和进步力量，制止了美帝国主义集团对中近东各国人民的自由和独立的侵略行为。大多数阿拉伯国家拒绝了殖民主义的“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”。侵略叙利亚的美国—土耳其计划遭到了谴责。现在帝国主义侵略势力已经很难能够把世界各国人民推向新的世界大战。世界公众的警惕性正在不断提高。英国、法国、意大利、西德、美国等资本主义国家的一些有名的活动家和一些巨大的社会组织坚持要求接受苏联为了维护和平而提出的英明的切实可行的建议，就令人信服地证明了这一点。甚至在巴黎举行的北大西洋公约组织会议也不能对苏联的这些建议保持沉默。不管帝国主义势力的统治者愿不愿意，这次会议还是在社会舆论的压力下，讨论了苏联的建议。可以满怀信心地说，1958年社会主义和爱好和平的力量定将继续加强并获得新的成就，反动和侵略势力定将遭到新的失败。
    问：你对过去一年来，中保两国人民间的友谊和兄弟合作的发展评价如何？你认为这种友谊和合作在1958年进一步发展的前景怎样？
    答：在过去的1957年中，进一步巩固和发展保中两国人民间的兄弟友谊和合作方面取得了巨大成就。以安·于哥夫为首的保加利亚政府代表团对中国的访问在这方面有着特别重要的意义。中国人民完成的巨大建设，中国共产党政治上的成熟及其以毛泽东同志为首的领导的英明，给我国代表团留下了强烈的难忘的印象。我国政府代表团对中国的访问和以中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长彭真同志为首的中国人民代表大会代表团对保加利亚的访问，是保中两国人民间牢不可破的友谊的鲜明表现。它显示了保中两国人民全力加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结的坚定不移的意志。1957年我们两国间的经济联系大大地扩大了。这一事实雄辩地说明了这一点：现在保中两国的换货量比签订两国第一个贸易协定时的1952年增加了两倍以上。科学技术和文化合作也扩大了。两国的许多科学家、作家和艺术工作者进行了相互访问。1958年有着进一步发展我们两国间的友谊和全面合作的更加广泛的前景。保加利亚政府和全体保加利亚人民愉快地期待着中华人民共和国政府代表团来保访问。他们深信，这次访问将是对加强我们的友谊和合作以及巩固世界和平的又一贡献。保加利亚议会代表团也将访问中华人民共和国。这次访问也将对建立我们两国人民间更加友好的联系作出贡献。保加利亚人民特别珍视同伟大中国人民的友谊。他们以中国人民是他们真挚的朋友而骄傲。保中两国人民是由共同的利益、共同的目的和共同的思想联系起来的。
    问：在1958年新年即将到来之际，你对中国人民有什么祝愿？
    答：保加利亚人民衷心祝贺兄弟般的中国人民不仅完成，而且超额完成中国共产党提出的人民中国第二个五年计划规定的伟大改造任务。这将进一步推动国家生产力的发展，更加迅速地提高中国劳动人民的物质和文化福利，并将更加提高作为遭受殖民主义压迫的各国人民的鼓舞人心的榜样的、和解决国际问题时不可缺少的一个伟大力量的中华人民共和国的作用和意义。保加利亚人民衷心祝贺中国人民更快地解放台湾。那时中国人民的宝贵理想——看到祖国完全从帝国主义奴役下解放出来——将要成为现实。
