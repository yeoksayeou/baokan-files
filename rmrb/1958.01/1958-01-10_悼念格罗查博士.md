    In Memory of Dr. Groza
    Dr. Petru Groza, President of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic, unfortunately passed away on January 7 after a long and serious illness. The death of Dr. Groza is a great loss not only for the Romanian people but also for peace-loving people all over the world. The Chinese people, with heavy hearts, extend our deepest condolences to the Romanian people!
    Dr. Groza was an outstanding political activist dedicated to the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism for the Romanian people. For decades, he had been tirelessly fighting for the independence, freedom, and socialist cause of his motherland. Before and during World War II, he stood with the Romanian people, engaging in a long-term struggle against imperialism, against the German fascists' aggression against Romania, and for the national liberation of Romania. After the liberation of Romania, he resolutely opposed the bourgeoisie reactionaries' attempts to restore the capitalist system, devoted himself to defending the revolutionary achievements made by the Romanian people, and maintained Romania's friendship and alliance with the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union. After the establishment of the Romanian People's Republic at the end of 1947, Dr. Groza, as one of the main state leaders of Romania, worked hard for Romania's socialist construction and made important contributions.
    Before the liberation of Romania, Dr. Groza was a bourgeois political activist who owned many enterprises and properties. However, his bourgeois origins did not prevent him from approaching and dedicating himself to the cause of social progress. From his seasoned political experience and personal experience, he had concluded that the capitalist system could never enable Romania to break away from the shackles of foreign imperialism and embark on the road of freedom and independence. After carefully examining the reality of the Soviet Union after the October Revolution and seriously studying Marxist-Leninist theory, he realized that only communism could "bring youth to mankind," and only the socialist path could enable Romania to achieve true independence, prosperity, and strength. The closer he got to the actual struggle of the masses, the more firmly he believed in this truth and was determined to fight for its realization. Therefore, as early as the pre-war years, Dr. Groza accepted the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party (the predecessor of the Romanian Workers' Party) and sincerely cooperated with the Romanian Communist Party in the struggle against domestic and foreign reactionaries and for social progress. After liberation, he worked even harder to implement the Romanian Workers' Party's line and policies for building socialism. It is precisely for this reason that Dr. Groza enjoyed a high prestige among the Romanian people and held an important position in the country's political life. Dr. Groza's transformation from a bourgeois political activist to a political activist dedicated to the socialist cause is commendable.
    What the Chinese people cannot forget in particular is Dr. Groza's sincere love and deep friendship for the liberated Chinese people. Three years ago, Dr. Groza visited our country at the invitation of Chairman Mao Zedong. During more than a month, Dr. Groza visited many cities, factories, rural areas, and cultural institutions in our country. He extensively contacted people from all walks of life in our country. In discussions with some representative figures from the industrial and commercial circles in our country, Dr. Groza, based on his personal experience, introduced the process of his own ideological transformation, explaining that under the historical conditions of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, bourgeois elements should and could accept socialist transformation. His remarks left a deep impression on the industrial and commercial circles.
    Dr. Groza was a close friend of the Chinese people. Now he has left us forever, but his lofty spirit of struggling for the peace, democracy, and socialist cause of the Romanian people throughout his life, and his deep affection for the Chinese people, will live forever in people's hearts.

    悼念格罗查博士
    罗马尼亚人民共和国大国民议会主席团主席彼·格罗查博士，在长期重病之后，不幸于1月7日与世长辞了。格罗查博士的逝世，不仅对于罗马尼亚人民，而且对于全世界爱好和平的人民是一个重大的损失。中国人民怀着沉痛的心情，谨向罗马尼亚人民表示深切的哀悼！
    格罗查博士是献身于罗马尼亚人民的和平、民主和社会主义事业的杰出的政治活动家。他几十年来一直为了自己祖国的独立、自由和社会主义事业而奋斗不懈。在二次大战以前和战争时期，他就同罗马尼亚人民站在一起，为反对帝国主义、反对德国法西斯对罗马尼亚的侵略，为争取罗马尼亚的民族解放进行了长期的斗争。罗马尼亚解放以后，他又坚决反对资产阶级反动派企图恢复资本主义制度的阴谋，竭力捍卫罗马尼亚人民所取得的革命成果，并维护罗马尼亚同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的友谊和同盟。1947年底罗马尼亚人民共和国成立之后，格罗查博士作为罗马尼亚主要的国家领导人之一，为罗马尼亚的社会主义建设事业努力服务，并作出了重要的贡献。
    格罗查博士在罗马尼亚解放以前，是一个拥有许多企业和地产的资产阶级政治活动家。但是，资产阶级的出身并没有妨碍他接近和献身于争取社会进步的事业。他从饱经沧桑的政治阅历和亲身体验中已得出结论，认为资本主义制度决不可能使罗马尼亚摆脱外国帝国主义的羁绊而走上自由独立的道路。在仔细考察了十月革命后的苏联现实和认真研究了马克思列宁主义理论之后，他认识到只有共产主义才能“给人类带来青春”，只有社会主义的道路才是使罗马尼亚获得真正独立、繁荣和富强的道路。他愈接近群众的实际斗争，他就愈加坚定地深信这个真理，并决心为实现这个真理而奋斗。因此，早在战前的年代里，格罗查博士就接受罗马尼亚共产党（罗马尼亚工人党的前身）的领导，在反对国内外反动派和争取社会进步的斗争中同罗马尼亚共产党真诚合作。在解放以后，他更为贯彻罗马尼亚工人党建设社会主义的路线和各项政策而努力。也正因如此，格罗查博士在罗马尼亚人民群众中享有很高的威信，在国家政治生活中有着重要的地位。格罗查博士从一个资产阶级政治活动家演变为献身于社会主义事业的政治活动家，是值得称颂的。
    中国人民特别不能忘记的，是格罗查博士对解放了的中国人民的真诚热爱和深厚友谊。三年以前，格罗查博士曾经应毛泽东主席的邀请来我国访问。在一个多月的时间内，格罗查博士在我国的许多城市、工厂企业、农村和文化机关中进行了参观访问。他广泛地接触了我国的各阶层人民。在同我国的一些有代表性的工商界人士交谈时，格罗查博士以亲身的体会，介绍了他自己思想转变的过程，说明在工人阶级领导的人民民主专政的历史条件下，资产阶级分子应该并且有可能接受社会主义改造。他的谈话在工商界人士中留下了深刻的印象。
    格罗查博士是中国人民的亲密的朋友。如今他已经同我们永别了，但是他毕生为罗马尼亚人民的和平、民主和社会主义事业而奋斗的崇高精神，他对中国人民的深厚感情，将永远活在人们的心里。
