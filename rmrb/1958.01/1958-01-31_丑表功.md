    Ugly Boasting
    The American "Time Magazine" published a comical short play on January 20th:
    Setting: A living room in a Manhattan hotel (mid-January)
    Characters: Former US President Truman, a reporter.
    Truman: Eisenhower was a great military commander in Europe and NATO, mainly because someone told him what to do.
    Reporter: Who told him what to do? Was it you?
    Truman: The Commander-in-Chief.
    Reporter: You were the Commander-in-Chief back then.
    Truman: Yes.
    Truman's performance of this "ugly boasting" does nothing to elevate the status of the current US President, but it does show how shameless this former US President is.

    丑表功
    美国“时代周刊”1月20日刊载一段无题的滑稽短剧：
    布景：曼哈顿一家旅馆的客厅（1月中旬）
    人物：美国前总统杜鲁门，记者。
    杜鲁门：艾森豪威尔在欧洲和北大西洋公约组织里曾经是一位伟大的军事统帅，主要是因为当时有人告诉他怎样干。
    记者：是谁告诉他怎样干呢？是您吗？
    杜鲁门：是最高统帅。
    记者：那时候您就是最高统帅吧。
    杜鲁门：是的。
    杜鲁门演出的这幕“丑表功”丝毫不能抬高美国现任总统的身价，但是却显出了这位美国前任总统多么不要脸。
