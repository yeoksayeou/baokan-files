Xinhua News Agency, 24th dispatch: The terms of office of the First National People's Congress, the Provincial People's Congresses, and the Second County-Level and Lower People's Congresses will expire this year. Currently, all regions across the country are actively carrying out preparatory work for this year's elections.

According to the resolution of the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress regarding issues of the election of representatives to the Second National People's Congress, the election of representatives to the Second National People's Congress must be completed before July 15, 1958, and the election of representatives to the Second People's Congresses of provinces and autonomous regions must be completed before June 15, 1958. In order to seamlessly connect the elections of people's representatives at all levels, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress also made a decision at its eighty-sixth meeting on November 29, 1957: the election of representatives to the people's congresses of counties, cities, municipal districts, townships, ethnic townships, and towns must be completed before May 31, 1958; the election of representatives to the people's congresses of municipalities directly under the central government must be completed before June 15, 1958. Currently, most provinces and cities, including Hebei, Liaoning, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Beijing, have established working bodies for election work. Some provinces have generally established working bodies for election work at the county level, many regions have formulated election work plans, and some provinces have also convened province-wide meetings to discuss and deploy election work.

This year's elections are being conducted on the basis of the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan and the great victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts in our country. In their election work plans, all regions have proposed to use the elections to further promote the superiority of our country's people's democratic system, expand democratic life, and encourage the masses to participate in the management of state affairs. Many regions have also proposed in their plans that this year's elections should be closely integrated with the nationwide rectification campaign. Henan Province pointed out in its plan that this year's election work must implement the spirit of rectification, mobilize the masses to fully express their views and carry out criticism during the elections, and combine this with rectification and improvement. Shaanxi Province required its subordinate regions to fully promote democracy on the basis of the socialist great debate, combine elections to comprehensively review the work of the government, criticize the unhealthy work styles of cadres, so that all cadres can receive a profound education under the supervision of voters, and overcome errors and shortcomings in leadership work. The specific arrangements for Hebei Province to combine elections and rectification are: When the election work begins, the rectification and improvement of the first batch of townships and communes undergoing rectification will have basically ended, and the results of rectification and improvement can be consolidated through elections. The second batch of townships and communes undergoing rectification will be precisely at the time when grassroots elections are generally underway, and the elections can promote rectification and accelerate rectification and improvement. The third batch of townships and communes undergoing rectification will be after the basic completion of grassroots election work, and voters can first put forward criticisms and opinions on the work of the government and the work styles of cadres through the elections, which will facilitate the comprehensive launch of the rectification movement in the future.

People's committees at all levels attach great importance to this year's elections. Many provincial governors, mayors, and county heads personally lead this work. Many places have proposed that in the elections, it is necessary to earnestly do a good job in reviewing the qualifications of voters, and elect outstanding representatives from all fields who support the Communist Party, resolutely take the socialist road, and closely contact the masses into the state power organs. For landlords who have changed their status, and those who have had their landlord status restored due to engaging in sabotage activities, their right to vote should be resolutely deprived in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. In order to make the election work adapt to the current situation where production tasks and other work are very heavy, all regions require that elections be carried out as much as possible during production gaps or in conjunction with production, so as to ensure that neither elections nor production are delayed. At the same time, it is required that the elections should further promote current production and construction. Some regions have also proposed that the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift should be implemented in the election work, avoiding simply pursuing form and extravagance.

    扩大民主生活　结合全民整风
    各地积极筹备选举
    新华社24日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会和省人民代表大会、第二届县以下各级人民代表大会都将在今年内任期届满。目前，全国各地正积极进行今年的选举筹备工作。
    根据第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议关于第二届全国人民代表大会代表选举问题的决议，第二届全国人民代表大会代表的选举必须在1958年7月15日以前完成，各省、自治区第二届人民代表大会代表的选举必须提前在1958年6月15日以前完成。为了使各级人民代表的选举上下衔接，全国人民代表大会常务委员会又在1957年11月29日第八十六次会议作出决定：县、市、市辖区、乡、民族乡、镇人民代表大会代表的选举，必须在1958年5月31日以前完成；直辖市人民代表大会代表的选举，必须在1958年6月15日以前完成。现在，河北、辽宁、山西、陕西、甘肃、山东、江苏、福建、河南、湖北、广东、广西、四川、北京等大部分省、市成立了选举工作的办事机构。有的省已经普遍建立了县一级的选举工作的办事机构，许多地区已经制订了选举工作计划，有些省还召开了全省性的会议，讨论和部署选举工作。
    今年的选举是在我国完成第一个五年计划和在政治上思想上的社会主义革命取得伟大胜利的基础上进行的。各地在选举工作的计划中，都提出要通过选举更加深入地宣传我国人民民主制度的优越性，扩大民主生活，鼓舞人民群众参加国家事务的管理。许多地区在计划中还提出今年的选举要和全民整风紧密结合进行。河南省在计划中指出，今年的选举工作必须贯彻整风精神，在选举中发动群众大鸣大放，开展批评，并且结合进行整改。陕西省在计划中要求所属各地在社会主义大辩论的基础上，充分发扬民主，结合选举，全面地检查政府工作，批评干部中的不良作风，使所有干部在选民的监督下受到一次深刻的教育，克服领导工作上的错误和缺点。河北省选举和整风结合进行的具体安排是：在开始选举工作时，第一批进行整风的乡社整改已基本结束，可以通过选举，巩固整改成果。第二批进行整风的乡社正是基层选举普遍展开的时候，可以通过选举促进整风，加紧整改。第三批进行整风的乡社是在基层选举工作基本结束以后，可以通过选举，让选民先对政府工作、干部作风提出批评意见，便于以后全面开展整风运动。
    各地人民委员会都很重视今年的选举。许多省长、市长、县长都亲自领导这一工作。许多地方提出，在选举中要切实做好选民资格审查工作，把拥护共产党、坚决走社会主义道路、密切联系群众的各方面的优秀代表人物选举到国家权力机关中来。对于已经改变成份的地主，因为从事破坏活动而被重新恢复地主成份的，应该坚决地剥夺其选举权，以巩固人民民主专政。为了使选举工作适应当前生产任务和其他各项工作都很繁重的情况，各地要求尽量利用生产空隙或结合生产进行选举，做到选举生产两不悮。同时要求通过选举把当前的生产建设向前推进一步。有些地区还提出，在选举工作中应该贯彻勤俭建国的方针，避免单纯追求形式和铺张的作法。
