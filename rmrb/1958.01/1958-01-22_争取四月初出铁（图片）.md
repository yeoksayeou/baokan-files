    Strive for Iron Smelting by Early April
    At Baizhi Mountain in Hushu Pass, Suzhou, the Suzhou Iron and Steel Plant, with an annual output of 30,000 tons of pig iron, is under accelerated construction. Currently, a socialist emulation campaign is in full swing at the construction site. Installation workers have proposed a guarantee: strive to complete the construction and installation tasks ahead of schedule by March 15th, and to produce iron by early April.
