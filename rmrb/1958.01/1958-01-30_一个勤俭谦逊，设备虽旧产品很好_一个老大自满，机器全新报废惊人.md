Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 29th – The Sino-private joint venture, Xi'an Zhongxing Electrical Machinery Factory, and the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory have achieved different results under the guidance of different ideologies and work methods. The former is meticulous in its calculations and relies on the wisdom of its workers to overcome various difficulties, producing many precision new products with old equipment and saving a lot of funds. The latter has not relied well on the workers and has not adhered to the policy of running enterprises with diligence and thrift. Although the technical equipment conditions are good, the amount of product scrapped is alarming, and the waste is great.

The Sino-private joint venture, Zhongxing Electrical Machinery Factory, has no engineers or technicians, and its production equipment consists of only fifty-odd outdated, small, belt-driven lathes. In the two years since the joint venture, the workers have produced 49 new products for the country under such backward production conditions without buying a single new machine. These products include a five-ton bridge crane, a two-ton road roller, cast iron pipes with diameters of one to two meters, as well as precision products as small as teacups, such as Soviet-style control motors and detector cores with tolerances not exceeding one-hundredth of a millimeter. Moreover, there have been no returns or fines in the performance of Party A's contracts, and the general products are fully compliant with specifications.

More than 90% of the equipment in the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory is newly purchased, and the factory has four engineers and more than forty technicians. Although the technical equipment conditions of this factory are much better than those of the former, some major products, especially most of the miscellaneous jobs, have not been delivered on time over the years, and they are often fined and pay bank interest on their behalf as a result. Last year, the cotton gin and seeder were fined more than 7,000 yuan for late delivery. When producing four-row cotton planters, sixteen left-hand bearings were mistakenly made into right-hand bearings, and one thousand cotton gins were found to have unusable gears after they were sent to the countryside. The farmers came to the factory to question them, so they had to rebuild them. Last year, the scrap rate of radiators reached 10% to 30%. Almost all of the radiator boiler bodies were scrapped, with preliminary estimates of losses of at least 50,000 yuan.

The products of both factories are not fixed, and many difficulties arise in terms of technology and equipment whenever they accept new tasks. When accepting new tasks, the leading cadres of the Zhongxing Electrical Machinery Factory always work with the workers to study how to make the most of, transform, or manufacture new equipment to overcome various difficulties. When producing the radiator boiler body, the workers used a scrapped planer, an old lead screw, and a cast iron headstock to make a "floor-type automatic feed milling machine," which increased work efficiency threefold. They carefully studied and inspected the production process, and the products fully met the requirements. When producing frame cart tile rings, there were no drawings or equipment, so the leading cadres and workers collectively researched and manufactured a complete set of dedicated automated equipment, and produced a batch of qualified products in a very short time. The workers also separated the headstock and body of an old small lathe to process various large workpieces, and removed the lower body of a small old drilling machine, removed the headstock, and installed it into a mobile machine tool, overcoming the difficulty of not having a large radial drilling machine.

However, the managers, especially the engineering and technical personnel, of the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory, rarely consult with the workers on matters, and there is a proud "big factory" mentality, which has brought losses to production. Before producing the radiator boiler body, the engineers and technicians thought it was simple and there was no problem. They rarely discussed it with the workers when designing it, and they did not carefully check it during production, only giving the drawings to the workers and considering it finished. As a result, almost all of the products were scrapped. In addition, the rework of one thousand cotton gin gears and the large-scale scrapping of mountain plow side panels and horse steel flanges were all related to the factory's insufficient reliance on workers.

After the Sino-private joint venture of the Zhongxing Electrical Machinery Factory, some employees had the wrong idea of ​​looking up to large factories and demanding that the state invest heavily in building factories and buying new machines. At that time, the public representative conducted an education on running enterprises with diligence and thrift to the workers, calling on the workers to work hard, overcome the difficulties of backward equipment with their own wisdom, and support national construction, which greatly encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers. The factory has carried out the spirit of diligence and thrift in the handling of everything, brick and tile. When the supply of raw materials was tight last year, a "revival movement of waste motors" was launched. Employees collected 34 waste motors in Qingdao, Jinan, Xi'an and other places, and saved the country more than 6,000 yuan in funds after repairing them. The employees also used the scrap of silicon steel sheets to produce 140 safety transformers, saving 480 kilograms of silicon steel sheets. According to incomplete statistics over the past year, the value of materials saved by the factory totaled more than 14,000 yuan. They only spent 3,000 yuan to build a building that can be used for five purposes (canteen, club, conference room, library, etc.). Last year, the factory dug five infiltration wells for ventilation in the workshop and excavated more than 80 cubic meters of loess. They calculated that it would cost money to transport the soil out, and it would also cost money to pull adobe bricks back from the outside to build the canteen, so the employees made it into adobe bricks to build the walls of the canteen, saving more than 240 yuan. They used discarded doors and windows, old templates, broken bellows, etc. to make ten pieces of tables, stools, and cabinets, saving the country's resources. Usually, every scrap, broken glass, iron beans, broken boxes, and waste cotton yarn in the factory are collected into the savings box in each workshop and applied after being sorted by a special person.

However, the leading cadres of the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory have the idea of ​​looking up to large factories and seeking largeness and newness. In order to blindly pursue the mechanization of foundry, they spent 24,000 yuan in 1951 to buy ten automatic shaping machines, which did not meet the needs of this factory at all. All were unused, and two of them have been resold. A lot of lost raw materials and semi-finished products can be seen in the factory. They also meet the welfare requirements put forward by the workers without analyzing them. They spent 20,000 yuan to build a sanatorium, which now seems that the sanatorium could have been not built if the old houses had been used rationally.

    一个勤俭谦逊，设备虽旧产品很好
    一个老大自满，机器全新报废惊人
    两个工厂鲜明对比
    本报特约新华社西安29日电　西安市公私合营中兴电机制造厂和西安农业机械厂，在不同的思想和工作方法指导下，得到了不同的结果。前一个是处处精打细算，依靠工人的智慧战胜各种困难，用老旧的设备生产出很多精密的新产品，节约了大量资金。后一个没有很好依靠工人和没有坚持勤俭办企业的方针，虽然技术设备条件好，但是产品报废数量惊人，浪费很大。
    公私合营中兴电机制造厂没有工程师和技术员，生产设备只有五十多台超龄的旧式小型皮带车床。公私合营后两年来，工人们就在这样落后的生产条件下，没有买一台新机器，为国家生产出四十九种新产品。这些产品中有五吨重的桥式行车、两吨重的压路机滚子、一至二公尺直径的铸铁管等，还有小如茶杯的仿苏式控制电动机和公差不能超过一丝的检波器芯子等精密产品。而且，在执行甲方合同上一直没有发生过退货和罚款的情况，一般产品都完全合乎规格。
    西安农业机械厂90％以上的设备都是新购的，全厂有四个工程师和四十多名技术员。这个厂的技术设备条件虽然比前一个厂好得多，但是历年来某些大宗生产品，特别是绝大部分的零星活，都不能按期交货，常常因此被罚款和代付银行利息。去年生产的轧花机、播种机，因为延期交货，被罚款七千多元。在生产四行棉花播种机时，把十六部左轴承错成右轴承，有一千部轧花机送到农村后才发现齿轮不能用。农民来厂质问，只好补造。去年生产的暖气片报废率达10％到30％。暖气锅炉大身几乎全部报废，初步预计至少损失五万元。
    这两个厂的产品都不固定，每当接受新任务，技术设备上都要发生许多困难。中兴电机制造厂的领导干部在接受新任务时，总是同工人一起研究怎样尽量利用、改造旧设备或制造新设备，克服各种困难。在生产暖气锅炉大身的时候，工人用一台报废的刨床、一根旧丝杠、一个生铁车头制成一台“落地自动走刀铣”，工作效率提高了三倍，在生产过程中仔细地研究、检查，产品完全合乎要求。生产架子车瓦圈时，既没有图纸，也没有设备，领导干部和工人集体研究，制造了全套专用自动化设备，在很短时间内就生产出一批合格的产品。工人还把旧的小镟床的车头车身分开来加工各种大型工作物，又把一台小型旧钻床的下身卸去，取下车头，另外装置成活动机床，克服了没有大型摇臂钻床的困难。
    但是，西安农业机械厂的管理人员特别是工程技术人员，有事很少同工人商量，存在着骄傲的“大厂”思想，给生产带来损失。生产暖气锅炉大身前，工程师、技术人员以为很简单，没问题，设计时很少同工人研究，生产中也不去仔细检查，只把图纸交给工人就算完事。结果产品几乎全部报废。此外，有一千部轧花机齿轮返工，山地犁侧板和马钢法兰盘大量报废，都同厂方依靠工人不够有关。
    中兴电机制造厂公私合营以后，部分职工曾经产生向大厂看齐、要求国家大量投资盖厂房、买新机器等错误思想。当时，公方代表即向工人进行勤俭办企业的教育，号召工人艰苦奋斗，用自己的智慧克服设备落后的困难，支援国家建设，这就大大鼓舞了工人的革命干劲。这个厂在处理一事一物、一砖一瓦上，都贯穿了勤俭节约的精神。去年原材料供应紧张时，就开展“废电机复活运动”。职工们到青岛、济南、西安等地搜集了三十四台废电机，修好以后，为国家节约六千多元资金。职工们还利用矽钢片的下脚料生产了一百四十台安全变压器，节约矽钢片四百八十公斤。据一年来不完全的统计，全厂节约材料的价值共达一万四千多元。他们仅仅花了三千元就盖成一座可作五用（食堂、俱乐部、会议室、图书室等）的建筑物。去年厂内为了车间通风打了五口渗井，挖出了八十多方黄土。他们计算把土运出去要花钱，要建筑食堂从外边拉回土坯也要花钱，因此职工们便把它都制成土坯，给食堂砌墙，节省了二百四十多元。他们用废弃的门窗、旧的型板、破烂的风箱等制成十件桌凳和柜子，为国家节省了资财。平时厂内一点、一滴的废料、碎玻璃、铁豆子、破箱子、废棉纱，都收集到每个车间的节约箱里，由专人整理后应用。
    但是，西安农业机械厂的领导干部却存在着向大工厂看齐、求大求新的思想，他们为了盲目追求铸工机械化，1951年用二万四千元买下十台自动制形机，根本不符合这个厂的需要，全部未用，其中两台已经转卖。全厂可以看到很多被丢失的原材料、半成品。对工人提出的福利要求，也不加分析地去满足。他们花了两万元专门建筑了一个疗养所，现在看来，如果合理利用旧有房屋，这个疗养所是可以不建筑的。
