    Basic Problems of International Politics
    Editorial Department of the Soviet "Izvestia"

    Today (January 28th), "Izvestia" published the reply from U.S. President Eisenhower, British Prime Minister Macmillan, and French Prime Minister Gaillard to the letter of December 10, 1957, from Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin.

    As everyone knows, the Soviet government's letter put forward a positive and concrete program for solving pressing international problems. Holding a meeting of the heads of government of some countries could serve as a starting point for solving the problems. Comrade Khrushchev reiterated the Soviet proposals aimed at easing international tensions in his speech in Minsk on January 22. The replies from Eisenhower, Macmillan, and Gaillard did not substantively discuss this proposal but immediately expressed a negative attitude towards it. However, world public opinion has shown the most enthusiastic interest in the Soviet peace program. They not only cannot agree to reject this proposal but also firmly advocate careful and well-intentioned study of the proposals made by the Soviet Union.

    When studying the replies of the heads of government of the three Western countries, one should also start from the sentiments and demands of the broad social circles and politicians of various countries who determine the current situation. The idea of peaceful coexistence has now become increasingly popular, which is a universally recognized and indisputable fact. The forces striving for peace and international security are acting everywhere. The calls for eliminating the "Cold War" have never been as loud as they are now. People hope to ease international relations, and they are increasingly urging governments to consult each other, end mutual suspicion, threats, and the atmosphere of war preparations that puts mankind on the brink of war.

    The Soviet Union responded clearly and affirmatively to the expectation of the people that governments of all countries should boldly devote themselves to exploring new ways to ease international relations. World public opinion is increasingly firmly supporting the Soviet government's peace initiatives. The Soviet government has put forward concrete suggestions for solving a series of pressing international relations issues. In his speech on January 22, Comrade Khrushchev put forward those definite issues that should be discussed first. Reaching an agreement on these issues would lay the foundation for a thorough improvement of the international atmosphere. Agreement must be reached without delay on the following issues: immediate cessation of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, ending the so-called "Cold War," stopping war propaganda, reducing the foreign troops currently stationed in Germany and other European countries, establishing a zone free of any kind of nuclear weapons in Central Europe, the situation in the Middle East, and eliminating artificial barriers in international economic relations.

    The proposal to convene a meeting of leaders of Eastern and Western countries has received particularly widespread support. Organizing this meeting immediately has virtually become a universal demand, and this demand is the main factor determining international life today.

    One cannot help but ask: To what extent can the replies of the heads of government of the three Western countries meet the expectations and demands of the people of all countries, including their own?

    First of all, it is satisfactory that these replies make it possible to continue the exchange of opinions between East and West based on the Soviet initiative. At the same time, these replies actually recognize that the exchange of opinions is beneficial. The fact that the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France considered it necessary to issue some declarations of commitment is also welcome. For example, U.S. President Eisenhower guaranteed that the United States would never "support any act of aggression coming from any collective defense organization or from any member of that organization." British Prime Minister Macmillan wrote that the British government "agrees with the Soviet government's desire to improve the international situation and establish good relations between our two countries." The British Prime Minister continued to write in his letter to the Soviet government leaders: "I can solemnly assure you that no British government will engage in aggression against the Soviet Union, participate in such aggression, or condone such aggression." Finally, the French head of government also expressed his opinion on this point: "A new world war would bring tragic consequences to all mankind."

    However, words like these, no matter how high-sounding, are definitely not enough. President Eisenhower has an argument: "The peaceful words of government leaders are not always a reliable yardstick for their actual measures." A sufficient explanation of this argument is the policies of the Western countries and the most recent manifestations of this policy, such as the plan to turn some countries into rocket bases aimed at the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries. The three Western countries treat this issue like they treat many other issues proposed by the Soviet government for genuinely easing international tensions, avoiding talking about them in their replies. This is probably not a coincidence...

    Unfortunately, even when breaking the silence, it is often to repeat the kind of lifeless, outdated tune that is getting farther and farther away from the reality of the international situation. Now, in Western countries, it is often pointed out that repeating this kind of argument does not indicate political and diplomatic flexibility, nor will it improve the situation.

    From the published replies, it can be seen that there are too many erroneous views and outdated suggestions, which are useless and will only make any international issue remain in a deadlocked state. Of course, this only refers to those useless suggestions that do not solve the problem. As for all other suggestions, they can and should be the subject of negotiations, and the Soviet government has made it clear about this. For example, according to President Eisenhower's argument, as long as there is a United Nations Charter, no other agreement is needed internationally. In this case, what problems are there to discuss? However, from Prime Minister Macmillan's point of view, the situation is different. In principle, he agrees that the relevant countries should conclude solemn treaties of non-aggression, recognizing that the principle of non-aggression is an integral part of the United Nations Charter. There is no doubt that this proposition by the British head of government creates promising prospects for reaching an agreement on this issue, as long as he consistently adheres to this proposition. But unfortunately, it is not clear that he is doing so.

    Gaillard's words are also attracting attention. He said, "The governments of our countries should... act in the spirit of mutual respect and honesty in international relations" and hope to reach "agreements that help to solve even partially concrete problems," and that reaching such agreements "would also solemnly affirm the firm will of the contracting countries to never engage in aggression." The French Prime Minister expressed his willingness to "explore ways to re-discuss those disarmament issues that divide us" and intends to "resume discussions on specific European issues," including discussions on the programs proposed by the Soviet government. However, Gaillard is self-contradictory: he preemptively denied all the Soviet government's proposals for easing international tensions.

    Neither President Eisenhower, nor Prime Minister Macmillan, nor Prime Minister Gaillard deny the benefits of direct contact between national leaders. The U.S. President expressed his willingness to meet with Soviet leaders to discuss the proposals put forward in Bulganin's letter and Eisenhower's reply. But the President insisted on holding a foreign ministers' meeting first and believed that whether the heads of government would meet depends on the success of the foreign ministers' meeting. On this issue, Macmillan has not actually expressed a clear attitude. However, most people in Britain are inclined to the Soviet proposal for an immediate top-level meeting. Whether Macmillan will take this opinion into consideration in his upcoming reply to Bulganin's letter of January 8 will be known in the future. As for the French head of government, he advocated holding a foreign ministers' meeting before convening a meeting of heads of government, and he stipulated in advance that the actual discussion of issues should not be the task of the foreign ministers, but that they should only determine the plan for the top-level meeting.

    Thus, at first glance, it seems that the Soviet Union and the Western countries have some common ground on the view that a meeting of heads of government must be convened. In fact, there are still different views on how to prepare for this meeting. Where does the divergence come from? We believe that the problem here is not a procedural issue.

    One can agree with a sentence from the U.S. President, who wrote: "I don't think it's useful for us to discuss which of our two governments wants peace more." But at the same time, it is also incorrect to avoid the question of on what principles peace should be guaranteed. As stated in the letter from Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin on December 10, 1957, the Soviet Union takes the status quo as the starting point on this issue, that is, two systems exist in the world: the socialist system and the capitalist system. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that when discussing the issue of guaranteeing peace, governments of all countries should set aside the differences in ideological consciousness determined by various socio-political systems. As before, the Soviet Union still advocates negotiations with the sole desire to do everything in its power to consolidate the cause of peace, stop the arms race, and develop broad cooperation based on the principles of peaceful coexistence. There is no doubt that this is in the interests of the people of all countries.

    It is not difficult to see that U.S. President Eisenhower's reply is based entirely on other premises, which far from take into account the balance of power that has formed on the current international stage, and the changes that have taken place in international relations in recent years are obviously underestimated. For example, when analyzing past wars, the President insisted that if the United States had been able to prepare in a timely manner in military terms, the war would not have happened at all. Although the United States did not formally participate in the early stages of the two world wars, this does not mean that the American monopoly organizations that actually determined American foreign policy did not participate. Leaving this aside, the President's explanation is also untenable in other respects. This statement clearly exaggerates the role of the United States in the development of historical events. It is clear that this is not done for no reason. Its purpose is to justify the current armament of the United States and the military measures it has taken in all corners of the world under the guise of ensuring peace.

    This erroneous idea of ​​ignoring the interests of other countries and emphasizing the special role of the United States in the development of world affairs is the foundation of President Eisenhower's reply. It is under the domination of this idea that the President stubbornly raises the issue of the social system of the European people's democratic countries and even the Soviet Union. It seems that it should have been understood long ago that the issue of the existence of socialist countries has long been determined by history, and it will never "obey" American monopoly capital. But it seems that American monopoly capital probably still considers itself omnipotent for self-comfort. At the same time, the facts show that American foreign policy based on this erroneous idea is increasingly conflicting with reality. It is not surprising that Dulles, a fanatical advocate of the theory of "peace based on American conditions," is facing increasingly sharp criticism from some members of the American ruling group.

    Anyone who does not indulge in illusions cannot but consider that the armament of the United States will cause other countries to arm themselves, and the United States wants to use force against these countries, it must be retaliated against. In this case, the United States will inevitably become the battlefield of a destructive war. In the current situation, publicizing American exceptionalism will only hinder the understanding of reality. For example, from Eisenhower's reply, it seems that the United States refuses to solve the general problem of disarmament, especially the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, but instead proposes to prohibit the use of outer space, that is, to prohibit intercontinental ballistic rockets. This approach can only be explained by being out of touch with reality. The intention of this U.S. proposal is not difficult to explain: to prohibit weapons that the United States does not have, while continuing to expand nuclear weapons. In this way, the United States can threaten other countries. But no one will fall for this trick!

    Everyone knows that the President rejected many of the Soviet Union's proposals to guarantee peace on the grounds that there is the United Nations organization, whose mission is to accomplish this task. According to him, since the United Nations exists, the Soviet Union's proposed treaty of non-aggression between member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and member states of the Warsaw Treaty Organization, the agreement not to use force in resolving all issues involving the Middle East, and many other Soviet proposals are superfluous. In this regard, the U.S. President did not proceed from the actual situation, but completely from the situation that the United Nations is generally satisfied with today. Despite not satisfying other countries and peoples, because they expect this international organization to take practical measures in disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and guaranteeing non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. As for the actual situation, it is contrary to the President's argument.

    For example, Eisenhower insisted that the United Nations Charter can guarantee the non-use of force in the Middle East, and mentioned that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, according to the United Nations Charter, not only guarantee not to use nuclear weapons, but also guarantee not to use any weapons to infringe on the territorial integrity or political independence of any country. However, the facts show that the existence of the United Nations Charter did not prevent Britain, France, and Israel from invading Egypt. Although the United Nations subsequently intervened, this invasion still caused Egypt a lot of casualties and material losses. Despite the existence of the United Nations Charter, what about Britain's continuous aggression against Oman and Yemen? This aggression poses a threat to peace in the Middle East. Why does the President not mention this fact that clearly violates the United Nations Charter? Why does he remain silent about the "Eisenhower Doctrine," which openly stipulates that the United States should carry out armed interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries based on ideological considerations? -- Although this violates the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter.

    No, if we want to find a practical way to peace, we cannot take a one-sided position to solve international problems, thinking that there can be no interests of anyone else in the world except for the interests of the United States. This view has never been untenable, and it is even more untenable now that there are many independent countries on the international stage willing to build their lives in the way that their own people like, not according to the wishes of some major powers.

    The U.S. President is very dissatisfied with the fact that representatives of communist and workers' parties from various countries discussed the issue of guaranteeing and strengthening peace in Moscow. But he is nonchalant about the dissatisfaction of other countries with the U.S.'s accommodation of all kinds of political adventurers and traitors to the people. Under the instigation of the U.S. authorities, these people are constantly advocating a crusade against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, which is fueling the atmosphere of war hysteria. How can this practice be reconciled with the U.S.'s hope for peace and its goodwill towards other countries mentioned in Eisenhower's reply?

    It may be worthwhile to raise two more facts related to some of the arguments in the U.S. President's reply. In order to defend the existence of the aggressive military group of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the reply mentioned the event of March 1939, when the Soviet Union declared that not establishing collective security was condoning aggression (although collective security is a completely different concept from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization). The President here ignores the specific historical situation. People knew clearly in early 1939 which country was preparing for aggression, because all kinds of war preparations were being carried out publicly with the open connivance of Western countries (including the United States) and in front of the whole world. The facts proved the correctness of the Soviet Union, because only six months later, Hitler's Germany launched an aggression, and it happened to intend to defeat its opponents one by one. The situation is different now, no one intends to attack Western countries. Therefore, the people of all countries are completely correct in thinking that the military groups established by Western countries are a threat to peace, and therefore also to them. It is said that a declaration of war must be approved by the U.S. Congress, but this does not change the essence of the matter, because under the current level of development of atomic rocket technology, military adventurers can confront Congress with a fait accompli.

    Finally, it is also necessary to talk about the false statement that the Soviet Union has not implemented the proposals of the 1955 Geneva Summit on the German issue. Eisenhower used this as an excuse to raise the issue of trust in the Soviet Union, as a prerequisite for all negotiations. However, the U.S. President also only said what the U.S. likes on this issue, and kept silent about what the U.S. does not like. Everyone knows that the Soviet representatives in Geneva emphasized that restoring German unification is a matter for the Germans themselves, and a matter for joint consultation between the two Germanys. The President's reply does not mention this at all, nor does it mention the part of the heads of government's instructions to the foreign ministers regarding "European security and Germany" which stipulates to study the issue of concluding a European security convention. The instructions clearly state that the realization of German reunification should be in accordance with the national interests of the German people and the interests of European security.

    British Prime Minister Macmillan and French Prime Minister Gaillard also raised reservations in their replies, which can only divert public attention from the main issues raised in Bulganin's letter. It is necessary to talk about this briefly in order to clear away those things that hinder substantive negotiations on the main issues raised in Bulganin's letter. Both Macmillan and Gaillard paid close attention to the issue of disarmament. The Soviet government's position on these issues is very clear. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union is tirelessly seeking ways to reach an agreement on the issue of disarmament, and has reduced its armed forces and military expenditures, demonstrating its sincerity in loving peace to the world. Let the heads of the British and French governments talk about what practical work they have done to promote disarmament and prevent the United Nations organization from becoming an agency for endless and fruitless discussions!

    As for Gaillard's call for the Soviet Union to agree with the principle that any war of aggression, no matter what ideological purpose it pursues, is unjust, it must be pointed out here that this call is obviously sent to the wrong place, and for some reason ignores the Soviet government's more than one formal statement on this issue.

    For some reason, the French Prime Minister believes that the Soviet Union's statement that it fully hopes to "guarantee the security, prosperity, and dignity of France" is incompatible with the Soviet Union's sympathy for the aims of the recent Asian-African Solidarity Conference in Cairo. In fact, there is no contradiction here. The Cairo conference advocated stopping the war in Algeria, which hopeless war will not promote the security and prosperity of France. Relying on maintaining the obviously outdated and shameful colonialist system cannot maintain the dignity of France.

    After analyzing the replies of Eisenhower, Macmillan, and Gaillard, one cannot help but think that all the reservations and arguments in these replies, as well as the untenable reasons for opposing the Soviet proposals, are used to divert the attention of the American, British, and French public from the truly important issues raised in Bulganin's letter for world peace.

    Therefore, we believe that it must be stated directly that some people not only want to plant time bombs in future East-West negotiations, but also want to plant time bombs in the possibility of this negotiation. Eisenhower, Macmillan, and Gaillard did not provide a convincing explanation in their replies: Why can't the heads of state start serious negotiations within the next few months?

    Who does not understand that if you treat the other party in the negotiations with prejudice and suspicion in advance, if you deliberately create new obstacles on the road to reaching an agreement, if you raise some issues that should not be discussed at all, or that you know cannot be agreed upon (because the differences on these issues are caused by different social systems and ideologies), it will not be beneficial.

    It is not surprising that socialist countries and capitalist countries have different views on the causes of international tensions and the development of events on the world stage. However, the facts are the facts, and these facts must be taken into account. This is exactly what is required all over the world now. More and more people, including bourgeois people in Western countries, understand that we must proceed from the existing international situation, we must proceed from the status quo, it is time to put away the plan to try to change the status quo by force, that is, it is time to abandon the notorious "position of strength" policy.

    Negotiations are to: reach agreements on some issues that can be agreed upon on a mutually acceptable basis, in accordance with the principle of peaceful coexistence that has been widely approved internationally.

    We should face the truth. The question now is: either the leaders of the governments of all countries sit at a table and discuss and plan a way to ease international tensions and solve international problems that agitate the world, or let the threat of atomic-rocket war with all its terrible consequences increase day by day.

    The international reaction to the Soviet proposals and the ever-expanding movement for high-level negotiations make it clear that Western countries have no less stake in such negotiations than the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

    Western countries have not yet responded to the Soviet government's proposal of January 8. Not only the Soviet people, but also the people of the whole world are waiting for the Western countries' reply.

    No one will doubt that the Soviet side will welcome every sincere and concrete step taken to achieve the following goal: to realize the necessary conditions that are now ripe for the leaders of Eastern and Western countries to hold a meeting to resolutely improve the international situation. How the situation will develop and in which direction: towards peace or towards further intensification -- this question is the basic question in current international politics.

    国际政治的基本问题
    苏联“消息报”编辑部
    “消息报”今天（28日）发表美国总统艾森豪威尔、英国首相麦克米伦和法国内阁总理盖伊阿对苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁1957年12
  月10日的信件的复信。
    大家知道，苏联政府的信件中为解决迫切的国际问题提出了积极具体的纲领。召开一些国家的政府首脑会议可以作为解决问题的开端。赫鲁晓夫同志1月22日在明斯克发表的讲话中重申了苏联旨在缓和国际紧张局势的建议。艾森豪威尔、麦克米伦和盖伊阿的复信实质上没有讨论这个建议，但是却立刻对这个建议表示了否定的态度。然而世界舆论却对苏联的和平纲领发生了最热烈的兴趣，他们不仅不能同意把这个建议拒之于门外，并且坚决主张仔细而善意地研究苏联提出的建议。
    研究三个西方国家政府首脑的复信时，也应该从决定当前局势的各国广大社会人士和政界人士的情绪和要求出发。和平共处的思想现在已经越来越深入人心，这是一个众所公认和不可争论的事实。争取和平和国际安全的力量到处都行动起来了。要求消灭“冷战”的呼声从来没有像现在这样响亮。人民希望缓和国际关系，他们越来越坚决地督促政府彼此协商，结束互相猜疑、威胁和把人类置于战争边缘的备战气氛。
    苏联明确而肯定地回答了人民要求各国政府大胆地致力于探求缓和国际关系新道路的期望。世界公众日益坚决拥护苏联政府的和平倡议、苏联政府提出了解决一系列迫切的国际关系问题的具体建议。在赫鲁晓夫同志1月22日的讲话中提出了那些应当首先讨论的、完全肯定的问题，就这些问题达成协议就会给彻底改善国际气氛打下基础。必须毫不拖延地就下列问题达成协议：立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器、结束所谓“冷战”、停止战争宣传、裁减目前驻在德国和欧洲其他国家境内的外国军队、在中欧建立无任何种类核武器的区域、关于中近东的局势、消除国际经济关系中的人为障碍。
    关于召开东西方国家领导人会议的建议得到了特别广泛的支持。立即组织这个会议实际上已经成为普遍的要求，这个要求是决定今天国际生活的主要因素。
    人们不禁要问：三个西方国家政府首脑的答复究竟能有多大程度符合各国人民的、也包括他们本国的人民的期望和要求呢？
    首先可以引以为满意的是，这些答复使得可以继续根据苏联的倡议在东西方之间进行交换意见，同时，这些答复实际上承认交换意见是有益的。美国、英国和法国政府首脑认为自己有必要发表一些承担义务的声明，这一事实也是值得欢迎的。例如，美国总统艾森豪威尔担保说，美国永远“不会支持来自某一个集体防御组织或者来自这个组织的某一个成员国方面的某种侵略行为”。英国首相麦克米伦写道，英国政府“赞同苏联政府改善国际局势和在我们两国之间建立良好关系的愿望”。英国首相在给苏联政府领导人的信中继续写道：“我可以很郑重地向您担保，任何一届英国政府都不会去进行反对苏联的侵略活动，不会参加这种侵略活动，也不会纵容这种活动。”最后，法国政府首脑也就这一点表示了意见：“新的世界大战将使全人类遭受悲惨的后果。”
    但是，像这一类话，无论说得怎样冠冕堂皇，都是定然不够的。艾森豪威尔总统有这样一个论点：“政府领导人的和平言论并不永远是他们采取实际措施时的可靠准绳”。可以充分说明这一论点的就是西方国家的政策以及这种政策的最近一些表现，如把一些国家变为矛头指向苏联和其他爱好和平国家的火箭基地的计划。三个西方国家对待这个问题像对待苏联政府为真正缓和国际紧张局势而提出的其他许多问题一样，在它们的复信中避而不谈。这未必是一件偶然的事……
    遗憾的是，就是在打破沉默的时候，也常常是为了重弹那种没有生命力的、离开现实的国际局势越来越远的旧调。现在，在西方国家里也常常有人指出，重复这一类的论调并不表示在政治上和外交上的灵活性，也不会使局势有所改善。
    从已经公布的复信中可以看出，其中误谬的看法和过时的建议是太多了，这些建议别无用处，只会使任何一个国际问题都处于僵持不决的态度。当然，这只是指那些毫不解决问题的无用的建议，至于其他一切建议，是能够而且应该作为谈判对象的，关于这一点苏联政府已有明白表示。譬如说，如果按照艾森豪威尔总统的论点，只要有了一个联合国宪章，国际上就再不需要有任何的协定，这样一来，还有什么问题可讨论的呢？然而从麦克米伦首相的观点看来，情况就不同了，他在原则上赞成有关国家缔结庄严的互不侵犯条约，承认互不侵犯原则是联合国宪章不可分割的一部分。毫无疑问，英国政府首脑的这种主张使得在这个问题上有着大有希望的达成协议的前景，只要他始终不渝地坚持这种主张；但是遗憾的是，看不出他是这样做。
    盖伊阿的话也很吸引人的注意。他说，“我们这些国家的政府在国际关系方面应该……本着互相尊重和诚实的精神办事”，并且希望达成“有助于哪怕是部分地解决具体问题的协议”，达成这种协议“同时也会庄严地肯定缔约各国具有永不进行侵略的坚决意志”。法国总理表示愿意“探求重新讨论那些使我们发生分歧的”裁军方面的“问题”的道路，还打算“恢复有关欧洲具体问题的讨论”，包括讨论苏联政府提出的方案。然而盖伊阿自相矛盾：他事先否定了苏联政府关于缓和国际紧张局势的一切建议。
    不论是艾森豪威尔总统，也不论是麦克米伦首相和盖伊阿总理，都不否认国家领导人直接接触的好处。美国总统表示愿意同苏联领导人会晤，以便讨论布尔加宁的信和艾森豪威尔的复信中所提出的建议。但是总统却坚持先召开外长会议，并且认为，政府首脑是否会谈要看外长会谈是否成功。在这个问题上，麦克米伦实际上还没有表示明确的态度。不过在英国大多数人是倾向于苏联关于立即举行最高级会谈的建议的。麦克米伦在即将答复1月8日布尔加宁的信的复信里是否会考虑到这种意见，将来就会知道。至于法国政府首脑，他主张在召开政府首脑会议之前先举行外长会议，他并且预先说明，实际讨论问题不应该是外长们的任务，他们只应当确定最高级会谈的计划。
    这样，骤然一看，好像苏联和西方国家对必须召开政府首脑会议的看法有某种相同之处。其实，对准备这次会议的方法仍然有着不同的见解。分歧从哪里产生的呢？我们认为，这里的问题不是程序问题。
    可以同意美国总统的一句话，他这样写道：“我觉得，要是我们讨论我们两国政府哪个更希望和平，那是没有益处的。”但是同时要想避开应当在怎样的原则基础上保证和平这个问题，那也是不正确的。正如1957年12月10日苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的信中所说的，苏联对这个问题是以现状为出发点的，即世界上存在着两个体系：社会主义体系和资本主义体系。因此，苏联认为，在讨论保证和平的问题时，各国政府应当置身于各种社会政治制度所决定的思想意识方面的分歧之外。像以前一样，苏联现在仍旧本着一个唯一的愿望主张谈判，这个愿望就是尽自己一切力量来巩固和平事业、停止扩充军备和根据和平共处原则发展广泛的合作。毫无疑问，这是符合各国人民利益的。
    不难看出，美国总统艾森豪威尔的复信完全是根据另外一些前提，这些前提远没有考虑到目前国际舞台上所形成的力量对比关系，对近年来国际关系中所发生的变化显然也是估计不足的。比如，总统在分析过去的战争时硬说，如果当时美国在军事方面能够及时准备好，战争就根本不会发生。美国在两次世界大战初期虽然形式上没有参战，然而这绝不意味着实际决定美国外交政策的美国垄断组织没有参战，姑且不谈这一点，可是在其他方面总统的解释也是不值一驳的。这种说法显然是夸大了美国在历史事态发展中的作用。很清楚，这样做并不是平白无故的，它的目的是为了替美国目前的进行武装以及它打着保障和平的幌子在世界各个角落所采取的军事措施进行辩解。
    这种企图忽视他国利益的、关于美国在世界事态发展中特殊作用的错误思想是美国总统复信的基础。正是在这种思想的支配下，总统才顽固地提出关于欧洲人民民主国家甚至苏联的社会制度的问题。似乎早就应当明白，社会主义国家的存在问题早已为历史所决定，它绝不会“听命于”美国垄断资本，但是看样子美国垄断资本大概是为了自我安慰，仍然认为自己是万能的。同时事实表明，以这种错误思想为基础的美国外交政策正在同现实发生越来越大的矛盾。毫不奇怪，“以美国的条件为基础的和平”这一理论的狂热鼓吹者杜勒斯正在遭到美国统治集团某些人士的越来越尖锐的谴责。
    凡是不耽于幻想的人，就不能不考虑到，美国进行武装将引起其他国家进行武装，美国要对这些国家动武，它就一定得到回敬。在这种场合下，美国必然要成为毁灭性战争的战场。在当前情况下，宣传美国例外，只会妨碍对现实的了解。例如，从艾森豪威尔的回信看来，美国拒绝解决裁军的一般问题，特别是拒绝禁止原子武器和氢武器，反而建议禁止利用宇宙空间，即建议禁止洲际弹道火箭，这种做法只能用脱离现实来解释。美国这种建议的用意不难解释：禁止美国所没有的武器，而继续扩充核武器，借此，美国就可以来威吓其他国家。但是，谁也不会上这个当！
    大家都知道，总统拒绝苏联关于保障和平的许多建议，其理由是：有联合国组织，它的使命就是完成这一任务。据他看来，既然有联合国存在，所以苏联所建议的关于北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约成员国之间签订互不侵犯条约、关于在解决涉及中近东一切问题时不使用武力的协定和苏联其他许多建议都是多余的。在这方面，美国总统决没有从现实情况出发，而完全从这一情况出发，即联合国现今的情况一般是使美国满意的。尽管并不使别的国家和人民满意，因为他们期待这个国际组织在裁军、禁止核武器和保证不干涉他国内政等方面采取实际措施，至于说到现实情况，则同总统的论据相反。
    譬如，艾森豪威尔硬说，联合国宪章可以保证在中近东不使用武力，并且提到，美国、英国和苏联根据联合国宪章不仅保证不使用核武器，而且还保证根本不使用任何武器来侵犯任何国家的领土完整或是政治上的独立。但是，事实说明，联合国宪章的存在并没有防止英国、法国和以色列三国侵略埃及，尽管联合国随后进行了干预，这次侵略毕竟还是使埃及遭受了不少的人员牺牲和物质损失。尽管有联合国宪章的存在，英国对阿曼和也门的不断侵略又怎样呢？这种侵略对中近东的和平造成威胁。为什么总统只字不提这种显然违反联合国宪章的事实呢？为什么他闭口不谈“艾森豪威尔主义”公开规定美国根据意识形态上的考虑要对阿拉伯国家的内政进行武装干涉呢？——虽然这违反联合国宪章的精神和文字。
    不，如果要寻找走向和平的实际途径，那就不能采取片面的立场来解决国际问题，认为世界上除了美国的利益，就不能有任何其他人的利益。这种观点从来都是站不住脚的，在现在当国际舞台上有许多独立国家愿意按照本国人民所喜爱的方式、而不是按照某些大国的意愿来建设生活的时候，这种观点是更加站不住脚了。
    美国总统对各国共产党和工人党的代表在莫斯科讨论保障和加强和平的问题是很不满意的。但是他倒满不在乎其他国家对美国收容形形色色政治冒险家和人民叛徒一事的不满。这般人在美国当局的怂恿下，时刻不停在鼓吹向苏联和其他社会主义国家发动十字军，也就是助长了战争歇斯底里的气氛。这种做法同艾森豪威尔复信中提到的美国希望和平、对其他国家怀着善意的论调怎么能协调起来呢？
    不妨再提出两点同美国总统复信中某些论调有关的事实。为了替北大西洋公约侵略性军事集团的存在辩解，复信中提到了1939年3月事件，当时苏联声明说，不建立集体安全就是纵容侵略（虽然集体安全同北大西洋公约组织是两个完全不同的概念）。总统在这里撇开了具体的历史情况。人们在1939年初就清楚地知道，是哪个国家在准备侵略，因为种种备战活动都是在西方国家（包括美国在内）公然的纵容下、当着全世界面前进行的。事实证明了苏联的正确，因为此后不过六个月，希特勒德国就发动了侵略，并且恰恰是打算把自己的对手各个击破。现在的情况不同了，谁也不打算进攻西方国家，因此，各国人民完全正确地认为，西方国家建立的军事集团是对和平、因此也是对他们的威胁。据说，宣战必须经美国国会批准，但是这并不能改变事情的实质，因为在原子火箭技术当前的发展水平下，军事冒险家能够使国会面临既成事实。
    最后还必需谈谈硬说苏联没有执行1955年日内瓦政府首脑会议关于德国问题的建议这种无中生有的说法。艾森豪威尔把这一点作为借口，提出对苏联的信任问题，以此作为一切谈判的先决条件。但是，美国总统在这个问题上也只说美国所喜欢的，而对美国所不喜欢的却绝口不提。大家知道，苏联代表在日内瓦曾经强调说过，恢复德国统一是德国人自己的事情，是两个德国共同协商的事情。总统的复信绝口不提这一点，而且也没有提到政府首脑给外交部长的指示关于“欧洲安全和德国”的一部分规定要研究有关缔结欧洲安全公约问题。指示中清楚地说，实现德国的重新统一应该符合于德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益。
    英国首相麦克米伦和法国总理盖伊阿在他们的复信中也提出了保留，这些保留只能转移公众对布尔加宁信中提出的主要问题的注意。必须简短地谈谈这一点，以便清除那些妨碍就布尔加宁信中提出的主要问题进行实质谈判的东西。不管是麦克米伦还是盖伊阿，都很注意裁军问题。苏联政府在这些问题上的立场是很明显的。人人都知道，苏联在不倦地寻求就裁军问题达成协议的途径，并且削减了武装部队和军费开支，向世界表示了自己爱好和平的诚意。让英法两国政府的首脑谈谈，他们为了促成裁军和不使联合国机构变成进行无休止的毫无成果的讨论机构做了些什么实际工作！
    至于谈到盖伊阿呼吁苏联赞同关于任何侵略战争、不论它追求怎样的意识形态上的目的、都是非正义的这一原则，那么这里必须指出，这个呼吁显然是送错了地方，而且不知因何缘故无视苏联政府关于这个问题的不止一次的正式声明。
    法国总理不知何故认为，苏联声明它完全希望“保障法国的安全、繁荣和尊严”这一表示同苏联对不久前开罗的亚非团结大会的宗旨的同情态度是不相容的。实际上这里没有丝毫矛盾。开罗会议主张停止在阿尔及利亚的战争，这个毫无指望的战争并不会促进法国的安全和繁荣，依靠维持显然过了时的可耻的殖民主义制度并不能保持法国的尊严。
    分析艾森豪威尔、麦克米伦和盖伊阿的答复以后，使人不能不认为，这些答复中的所有保留和论点以及站不住脚的反对苏联建议的理由，都是用来转移美国、英国和法国公众对布尔加宁信中为了世界和平而提出的真正重要的问题的视线。
    因此，我们认为必须直截了当地指出，某些人士不仅想对将来的东西方谈判布置定时地雷，而且还想要对这次谈判的可能性布置定时地雷。艾森豪威尔、麦克米伦和盖伊阿在复信中没有提出令人信服的说明：为什么到现在，各国首脑还不能在最近数月内开始举行认真的谈判。
    谁不清楚，如果预先就抱着偏见和怀疑的态度对待谈判的对方，如果故意在达成协议的道路上制造新的障碍，如果把一些根本不应当讨论、或是明知不能达成协议的问题（因为在这些问题上的分歧是由于社会制度和意识形态的不同而造成的）提出来讨论，那是不会有好处的。
    社会主义国家和资本主义国家对产生国际紧张局势的原因和世界舞台上事态的发展具有不同的看法，这是不足为奇的。但是，事实就是事实，这些事实是必须加以考虑的。世界各地现在所要求的正是这一点。越来越多的人们，其中包括西方国家资产阶级人士，懂得必须从现存的国际局势出发，必须从现状出发，该是把企图用强力来改变现状的打算收拾起来、也就是说该是抛弃臭名远扬的“实力地位”政策的时候了。
    要进行谈判是为了：在双方都可以接受的基础上，根据在国际上已经获得广泛赞同的和平共处的原则，就一些可以达成协议的问题获致协议。
    应该正视真理。现在的问题是：或者是各国政府的领导人坐在一张桌子上商谈，规划出一条缓和国际紧张局势和解决激动着世界的国际问题的途径，或者是让带有一切可怕后果的原子—火箭战争的威胁日益增长。
    苏联的建议所得到的国际反应和不断扩大的争取高级谈判的运动使人毫不怀疑，西方国家对于这种谈判的利害关系，并不亚于苏联和其他社会主义国家。
    西方国家还没有对苏联政府1月8日的建议作出答复。不仅是苏联人民、而且全世界人民都在等待西方国家的答复。
    没有一个人会怀疑，苏联方面将欢迎每一个为了达到以下目的而采取的诚恳而具体的步骤：即实现当前已经成熟了的必要的条件，以便东西方国家领导人举行会晤来坚决改善国际局势。局势将怎样发展和向哪一方面发展：趋向和平，还是趋向进一步尖锐化——这个问题就是当前国际政治中的基本问题。
