Switching to High-Yield Crops and Developing Diversified Economy
Luquan County's People of All Ethnic Groups See Significant Income Increases

    (Report from this newspaper) The impoverished and backward appearance of Luquan County, Yunnan Province, has undergone significant changes.

    Luquan is a very poor mountainous county inhabited by various ethnic groups. Of the 220,000 population, the Yi, Miao, Hui, Lisu, and Dai ethnic groups account for 32%. Except for a few river valley areas, most of the county is barren mountainous terrain.

    In recent years, due to vigorous development of mountainous areas, total grain output has increased from 99 million jin in 1952 to more than 140 million jin. The yield per unit area has also increased from an average of over 200 jin per mu to 492 jin per mu. Some high-yield fields have reached more than 1,500 jin, and many production teams have emerged with yields of 1,000 jin per mu. Now, after deducting public grain, the average per capita grain holding in the county is 680 jin, exceeding the production level of local well-to-do middle peasants.

    The reason Luquan County has achieved such great success is that the local Party committee led the masses to promote the replacement of low-yield crops such as buckwheat and oats with high-yield crops in the high-altitude and cold mountainous areas, increasing yields by more than tenfold. In general mountainous areas, they changed barnyard grass fields to rice fields and black millet to white millet, focusing on the development of corn and rice, which increased yields by more than twofold. In the warm climate of the dammed areas, they actively developed rice, increasing the yield per unit area from the original 400 jin to 700 or 800 jin. In the river valley areas with year-round summer-like temperatures, in addition to actively developing grain crops, they also developed cash crops such as cotton, sugarcane, and flue-cured tobacco, implementing a planned policy of developing diversified crops in accordance with local conditions. In addition, they vigorously built water conservancy projects, increased the application of fertilizers, and changed the old habit of planting "white seed land."

    In the Second Five-Year Plan, Luquan County's total grain output will increase by 120% compared to 1957, and the average income of each commune member will increase from 70.4 yuan to 230 yuan.

### 改种高产作物发展多种经济  禄劝县各族人民收入显著增加

    改种高产作物发展多种经济
    禄劝县各族人民收入显著增加
    本报讯　云南禄劝县的贫瘠落后面貌已经显著改观。
    禄劝是非常贫困的民族杂居的山区县，二十二万人口中，彝、苗、回、傈僳、傣等八个兄弟民族占32％。境内除少数河谷地带外，大部分均为贫瘠山区。
    几年来，由于大力开发山区的结果，粮食总产量已由1952年的九千九百万斤增加到一亿四千多万斤；单位面积产量也由平均每亩二百多斤，提高到四百九十二斤；有的高产田达到一千五百多斤，并出现了很多亩产一千斤的生产队。现在，除去公粮，全县平均每人尚有粮食六百八十斤，超过了当地富裕中农的生产水平。
    禄劝县所以取得这样大的成绩，是由于当地党委领导群众在高寒山区推行了改低产的荞麦、燕麦等高产作物，使产量提高十多倍；在一般山区改稗田为谷田，改黑谷为白谷，着重发展包谷、水稻，使产量提高二倍多；在气候温和的坝区，积极发展水稻，使单位面积产量由原来的四百多斤，提高到七、八百斤；在四季如暑的河谷地带，除积极发展粮食作物外，还发展棉花、甘蔗、烤烟等经济作物，贯彻了有计划的因地制宜的发展多种作物的方针。此外，他们还大力兴修水利，增施肥料，改变了种“白籽地”的旧习惯。
    在第二个五年计划中，禄劝县的粮食总产量要比1957年增长120％，每个社员的平均收入将由七十元四角增至二百三十元。
