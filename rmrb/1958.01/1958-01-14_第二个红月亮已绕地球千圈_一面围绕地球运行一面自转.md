Xinhua News Agency, January 13th dispatch from Moscow: As of 2:00 AM Moscow time on January 13th, the second artificial satellite had orbited the Earth one thousand times. Since the second satellite was launched into orbit, its travel distance has reached 45.4 million kilometers, more than 120 times the distance from the Earth to the Moon, and equal to three-quarters of the closest distance between Mars and Earth.

Xinhua News Agency, January 13th dispatch from Odessa: The Soviet Union's second artificial Earth satellite, while orbiting the Earth, also rotates on its axis. One half rotation takes approximately eighty seconds. This was stated by Soviet astronomer Zesevich in an interview with TASS reporters.

Professor Zesevich is a Corresponding Academician of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and the Director of the Odessa Observatory. He said that recent observations of the second satellite by the Odessa Observatory have shown that the satellite's brightness changes rapidly. Sometimes it looks like a very bright star, and sometimes it is almost completely invisible to the naked eye. From this, it can be determined that the satellite, carrying its launch rocket, rotates like it is tumbling. Its brightness depends on whether its side or its tail is facing the observer and the sun at that moment.

    第二个红月亮已绕地球千圈
    一面围绕地球运行一面自转
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科消息：到1月13日莫斯科时间两点正为止，第二个人造卫星已经绕地球转了一千圈。从第二个卫星被发射上轨道的时候算起，它的运行路程已达四千五百四十万公里，超过从地球到月球距离的一百二十多倍，等于火星离地球最近时两者距离的四分之三。
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社敖德萨讯：苏联第二个人造地球卫星在围绕地球运行的同时还要以自己的横轴为中心自转，自转半周的时间约为八十秒，这是苏联天文学家泽谢维奇在同塔斯社记者谈话时说的。
    泽谢维奇教授是乌克兰科学院通讯院士敖德萨天文台台长。他说，敖德萨天文台最近对第二个卫星的观察结果证明，卫星的亮度变化很快，有时候看上去像一颗最亮的星星，有时候肉眼几乎完全看不到。从这里可以断定，带着运载火箭的卫星像翻斤斗一样地自转，它的亮度决定于它在当时对着观察者和对着太阳的一面是它的侧面还是它的尾部。
