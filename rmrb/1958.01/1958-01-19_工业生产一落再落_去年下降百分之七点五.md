Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 17th: The Federal Reserve System Board announced on the 16th that the production index shows that U.S. industrial production fell by 7.5% in 1957. According to figures released by the agency, the preliminary figure for the U.S. industrial production index in December 1957 fell three points from November, dropping to 136 points. November 1957 was 139 points, while December 1956 was 147 points. In summarizing the U.S. economic situation in December, the Federal Reserve System Board said that steel production in December last year and early January this year was about 40% lower than a year earlier. Automobile assembly in December was about 10% lower than in November. Production of building materials, agricultural machinery, textiles, clothing and rubber products also declined.

The U.S. Department of Commerce said on the 15th that U.S. personal income in December 1957 continued to decline for the fourth consecutive month. The portion attributable to wages and salaries decreased by $750 million due to factory layoffs and shorter work weeks.

In a recent report reflecting the demands of monopoly capital issued by the U.S. "Conference on Economic Progress," after pointing out that the current U.S. economy is "in a state of serious depression," it demanded that the U.S. government increase military spending by $3 billion this year.
