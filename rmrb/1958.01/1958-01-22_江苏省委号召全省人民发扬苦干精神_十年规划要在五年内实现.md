Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 20th: The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an enlarged meeting, calling on all Communist Party members and the people of Jiangsu Province to work hard for five years and achieve the goal of 500 and 800 jin of grain per mu ahead of schedule.

This enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee was another promotion conference in Jiangsu Province after the Party Congress in December last year. In the four days before the meeting, the Provincial Party Committee convened a meeting of secretaries of the prefectural and municipal party committees to examine and analyze the winter production movement with a spirit of self-criticism, and studied the national farmland water conservancy progress table recently published in the People's Daily. Subsequently, an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee was held, calling on people to learn from advanced regions, catch up with advanced regions, and put forward the above-mentioned goals and new requirements for the winter production movement.

According to statistics, as of the 17th, Jiangsu Province had built more than 340 million cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects, and the benefits of water conservancy projects can increase the irrigated area and drainage area by more than 13 million mu. 6.5 billion dan of fertilizer have been accumulated, with an average of 70 dan of fertilizer accumulated per mu of land. More than 41 million mu of farmland have been top-dressed, accounting for more than 64% of the summer crop area. 520,000 mu of forest have been planted in large areas throughout the province, and more than 130 million trees have been planted around villages. Many advanced examples that have emerged in the movement have refuted the argument that "agricultural production can only be gradual and cannot leap forward."

At the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, the "Jiangsu Province Agricultural Production Plan" (draft) was basically approved. The plan stipulates that by 1962, the annual yield of grain per mu will reach the level of 500 jin and 800 jin respectively, and the annual yield of ginned cotton per mu will reach the level of 60 jin, 80 jin and 100 jin respectively.

Based on the plan, the Provincial Party Committee, in the spirit of "looking at three years in five years, and looking at the first year in three years," formulated three-year production increase measures. In terms of water conservancy, it is required to increase the construction of water conservancy projects from the original plan of more than 500 million cubic meters of earthwork to 1 billion cubic meters of earthwork before spring plowing. And within three years, the province's paddy fields will be increased from the current 36 million mu to more than 53 million mu, and the irrigated land will be increased from the current 2 million mu to more than 24 million mu. Among the more than 53 million mu of paddy fields, nearly 60% must become gravity irrigation, electric irrigation and machine irrigation. At the same time, the disasters of drought and flood must be basically eliminated within three years. In terms of fertilization, it is required to actively organize agricultural cooperative members to vigorously accumulate fertilizer, develop pig and sheep raising, and reach or exceed the fertilization level of wealthy middle peasants this year. Within three years, the number of pigs raised will increase from the current 9.5 million to 25 million. It is also necessary to expand the planting of green manure, carry out basic construction for fertilizer accumulation, and basically require that people have toilets and pigs have sties this spring; and mobilize urban people to send fertilizer to the countryside, and exploit peat, accelerate the construction of chemical fertilizer factories, etc. In terms of soil improvement, according to the province's situation, it is required to basically improve more than 30 million mu of saline-alkali soil, swampy soil and brownish-yellow soil. Within three years, more than 17 million mu of dry land in the province will be converted into paddy fields, and double-cropping rice will be developed, and indica rice will be changed to japonica rice, and single-cropping paddy fields will be changed to double-cropping rice and wheat fields. The multiple cropping index should be increased from the current 166% to 200%. The meeting also put forward specific plans for important measures such as developing animal husbandry, preventing and controlling crop diseases and insect pests, afforestation and greening, and the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests.

At the meeting, the Provincial Party Committee analyzed the new situation of agricultural production in Jiangsu Province, calling on all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, cadres sent to lower levels, and demobilized soldiers to unite the people of the province, with a tenacious revolutionary spirit, work hard, work practically, and work creatively to continue the large-scale winter production movement and actively prepare for spring plowing. The Provincial Party Committee requires leading cadres at all levels to further change their work style in the rectification movement, personally engage in experimental fields, learn to use visits, appraisals and competitions, carry forward advanced leadership methods, and constantly lead the production movement to a climax, so as to ensure a great leap forward in production this year and lay the foundation for achieving 500 jin and 800 jin in five years.

At the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, urban work was also studied.

    江苏省委号召全省人民发扬苦干精神
    十年规划要在五年内实现
    新华社南京20日电　中共江苏省委最近举行扩大会议，向江苏全省共产党员和全体人民提出了苦干五年，提前实现粮食五百斤、八百斤的奋斗目标。
    这次省委扩大会议是江苏省继去年12月党代表大会以后的又一次促进会。会议以前的四天，省委召开了地委市委书记会议，以自我批评精神检查和分析了冬季生产运动的情况，研究了人民日报最近刊出的全国各地农田水利进度表。接着召开了省委扩大会议，号召向先进地区学习，迎头赶上先进地区，提出了上述奋斗目标和冬季生产运动的新要求。
    据统计，到17日止，江苏省已经兴修水利工程三亿四千多万土方，水利工程效益可以增加灌溉面积和排涝面积一千三百多万亩。积肥六十五亿担，平均每亩田已积肥七十担。农田追肥四千一百多万亩，占夏熟作物面积64％以上。全省成片造林五十二万亩，四旁植树一亿三千多万株。运动中出现的许多先进事例，驳倒了“农业生产只能渐进不能跃进”的论调。
    在省委扩大会议上基本通过了“江苏省农业生产规划”（草案）。规划规定，到1962年，每亩粮食年产量分别达到五百斤和八百斤的水平，皮棉每亩年产量分别达到六十斤、八十斤和一百斤的水平。
    省委根据规划，又用“五年看三年，三年看头年”的精神，订出了三年增产措施。在水利方面，要求在春耕以前兴修水利由原计划的五亿多土方增加到十亿土方。并在三年内，将全省水稻田由现在的三千六百万亩增加到五千三百多万亩，水浇地由现在的二百万亩增加到二千四百多万亩。在五千三百多万亩水稻田中，有近60％要成为自流灌溉、电力灌溉和机器灌溉。同时要在三年内基本上消灭旱涝灾害。在施肥方面，要求积极组织农业社员大力积肥，发展养猪养羊，今年就达到或超过富裕中农的施肥水平。三年内养猪要由现在的九百五十万头增加到二千五百万头。还要扩大种植绿肥，进行积肥的基本建设，今春基本上要求做到人有厕所猪有圈；并发动城市人民向农村送肥，并开采泥炭，加速建设化学肥料工厂等。在改良土壤方面，根据本省情况，要求把三千多万亩盐渍土、沼泽泥土和棕黄土基本上改良过来。在三年内，将全省一千七百多万亩旱地改做水田，并发展双季稻，实行籼稻改粳稻、一熟水田改成稻麦两熟田等。复种指数要由现在的166％，增加到200％。对于发展畜牧业、防治农作物病虫害、绿化造林等重要措施和以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动等方面，会议都提出了具体规划。
    省委在会议上分析了江苏省当前农业生产的新形势，号召全省共产党员、共青团员、下放干部和转业军人，团结全省人民，以顽强的革命精神，苦干、实干、创造性地干，把大规模的冬季生产运动持续下去，积极做好春耕准备工作。省委要求各级领导干部在整风运动中进一步改变作风，亲自搞试验田，学会运用参观评比竞赛，发扬先进的领导方法，不断地把生产运动引向高涨，保证今年生产大跃进，打下五年实现五百斤、八百斤的基础。
    省委扩大会议上，对城市工作也作了研究。
