    More on "Evening Meal of Autumn Chrysanthemum's Fallen Petals"
    Jia Zuozhang
    Shi Zhengzhi, who wrote the postscript to "Chrysanthemum Treatise," was a proponent of chrysanthemum petals falling. He said: "Some flowers drop their petals, and some do not. Generally, flowers with densely packed petals do not fall; after full bloom, light yellow ones turn white, and white ones gradually turn red and wither on the branch. Flowers with sparse petals tend to fall; after full bloom, they gradually become scattered, and when shaken by wind and rain, they scatter all over the ground." In this way, falling and not falling seem to be distinguished clearly and definitively.
    However, what is generally referred to as a single chrysanthemum is actually a capitulum (also called a head inflorescence), which is densely formed from countless florets. These florets all grow on the same receptacle, and regardless of whether their shape is tubular, ligulate, or needle-shaped, and regardless of whether they are large or small petals, they are all clustered together closely. The so-called "dense" and the so-called "sparse" are fundamentally indistinguishable. Since the criteria for distinguishing between falling and not falling are unreliable, the matter of chrysanthemum petals falling can still be doubted.
    Not only chrysanthemums, but the flowers of other plants in the Compositae family generally do not scatter. Spring's garland chrysanthemum, summer's China aster, and autumn's zinnia and dahlia do not scatter. For example, the spring dandelion, after flowering, the entire inflorescence will close up until the fruit matures, and the calyx turns into a white pappus. Only then do the individual fruits, like parachutes, leave the receptacle with the help of the wind. It turns out that it waits until the fruit matures before scattering, but by this time the petals have already withered.
    Judging from the dandelion's situation and extrapolating to chrysanthemums, it should also be said that if chrysanthemums can bear fruit, then when the fruit matures, the flowers will easily scatter. If the time from fruiting to maturity is not long, then when the fruit matures, the petals may not have completely withered, which may lead to the phenomenon of "a ground covered in gold."
    Commonly cultivated chrysanthemums usually do not bear fruit. In order to cultivate new varieties, artificial pollination is attempted, and they must be kept in a greenhouse until February or March before the fruit matures. In the wild, chrysanthemums should bear fruit, and they must adapt to the local natural environment. Before the harsh winter arrives, the fruit should already be mature. In this way, in the South, wild chrysanthemums or chrysanthemums with a shorter cultivation history may, after flowering, because the climate is relatively warm, mature and scatter their fruits after a certain period.
    The "Songs of Chu" celebrates phenomena of the South, and Su Shi saw chrysanthemum petals scattering in Huangzhou, which is also in the South, and Wang Anshi's poems also describe the scenery of Wuyi, which can be said to be consistent with the above reasoning.
    However, we must have factual evidence to make a definitive conclusion as to whether anyone has actually seen chrysanthemums scattered by wind and rain or scattering on their own. It is not enough to simply cite literature, simply rely on reasoning, or even if based on observation, but the observation and recording are not completely accurate.

    再谈“夕餐秋菊之落英”
    贾祖璋
    做“菊谱”后序的史正志，他是主张菊花会散落的。他说：“花有落有不落者。盖花瓣结密者不落，盛开之后，浅黄者转白，而白色者渐转红枯于枝上。花瓣扶疏者多落，盛开之后，渐觉离披，遇风雨撼之，则飘散满地矣。”这样说，落与不落，好像区分得很清楚，很明确。
    但是，一般所说的一朵菊花，其实是一个头状花序（又叫篮状花序），它是由无数朵小花密集而成的。这些小花同生在一个花托上，不论它们的形状是管状、舌状、还是针状，也不论它们是大瓣、还是小瓣，全都是一朵挨着一朵，密密地丛集在一起的。所谓“结密”，所谓“扶疏”，根本无法区别。区别落与不落的标准，既然并不可靠，关于菊花会落一事，那就仍然可以怀疑了。
    不仅菊花，菊科的其他植物，花一般都是不会散落的。春天的茼蒿，夏天的翠菊，秋天的百日草、大理菊都不会散落。又如春天的小草蒲公英，花开过以后，整个花序会闭合起来，直到果实成熟，萼变成白色的冠毛，一个一个小果实才像降落伞一样，趁风离开了花托。原来它要等到果实成熟才会散落，不过这时候花瓣早已枯萎了。
    从蒲公英的情况来推测菊花，也应该说菊花假使能够结实，那末到了果实成熟的时候，花朵便容易散落。假使从结实到成熟的时间不长，那末果实成熟的时候，花瓣可能还没有全部枯萎，这就可能出现“满地铺金”的现象。
    一般栽种的菊花，通常都不结果实，为了育成新品种，设法人工授粉，必须保养在温室里，直到二三月间，果实才会成熟。在野生状态下，菊花应该会结果实，而且一定会适应当地的自然环境。在严冬到来以前，果实就已经成熟了。这样说，在南方，野菊或培养历史较短的菊花，开花以后，可能因为气候比较温暖，经过一定时间，它们结的果实就会成熟而散落。
    “楚辞”所歌咏的是南方的现象，苏轼看到菊花散落的黄州也在南方，而王安石的诗也是记述武夷的风光，可说与上述推论相合。
    但是现在究竟有没有人看到过菊花会受风雨的影响而散落，或是自行散落，我们必须有事实的依据，才能作肯定的结论。单纯引证文献，单纯依据推理，或是虽然依据观察，但观察和纪录并不完全正确，那都是不足为凭的。
