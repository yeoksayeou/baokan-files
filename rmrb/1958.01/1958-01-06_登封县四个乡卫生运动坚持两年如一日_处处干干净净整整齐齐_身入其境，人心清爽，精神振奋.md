    Dengfeng County's Four Townships Persist in Health Campaign for Two Years, Like Day One
    Everywhere is Clean and Tidy
    Immersed in the Environment, Hearts are Refreshed, Spirits are High
    This newspaper reports that the four townships of Jingdian, Tangzhuang, Yutai, and Daye in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, have basically eliminated the four pests.

    In the past, the sanitation in these four townships was very poor. Every household had a manure pile in front of their door, fertilizer was piled on the streets, the roads were uneven, bricks and rubble were everywhere, the streets were full of dirty water after rain, and the toilets of each household were full of feces and urine, which flowed everywhere after rain. Many people suffered from diarrhea and dysentery during the summer and autumn, and malaria was even more common (meaning almost every household had it). In 1951, Jingdian Township had 323 people suffering from dysentery, accounting for about 11% of the township's total population.

    However, since the launch of the eliminate-four-pests and promote-hygiene campaign in the winter of 1955, these four townships have now become model sanitation townships. They have basically achieved the following: no rat holes, no bird nests, no maggots in latrines, no mosquitoes and flies in living rooms, no dust under beds, no garbage on the streets, no weeds and gravel, and no ash on the stove and no mud on the well platform. Walking into these townships, you can see clean and tidy streets. The streets and alleys are often swept clean, and many households have posted honorary bulletins of "Clean and Fly-Free Households" or raised red flags of advanced sanitation. Garbage bins and firefighting water tanks have been established. The kitchens and living rooms of every household are arranged in an orderly manner, and the cooking utensils are washed very clean. Most of the toilets have been improved and covered. Regardless of the condition of the houses or the age of the clothes, all kinds of things are tidy and clean. Immersed in such an environment, one feels refreshed and invigorated.

    When these townships launched the eliminate-four-pests and promote-hygiene campaign in the winter of 1955, many people spread rumors, saying, "Just talking about hygiene won't produce grain in the fields, and it won't stop you from starving." Many cadres and Party members also lacked confidence. In this situation, it was necessary to start with cultivating role models, focusing on key areas, and gradually expanding from point to area. For example, under the unified leadership of the Party branch, Jingdian Township identified Jingdian Village as the key area, and Jingdian Village further focused on North Street. After networking and mobilizing people, recounting past sufferings, and comparing the past with the present, as well as doctors conducting widespread health publicity and education while treating diseases, the campaign was launched. The traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Li Xiu, through treating Wang Hailong's dysentery, publicized how dysentery is transmitted and helped his family to tidy up the house, cooking utensils, and clean the courtyard. Moved by this, Wang Hailong also started to pay attention to hygiene. He spread the word everywhere, motivating all forty-two households in North Street to take action. When people in South Street saw that North Street had taken action, they also took the initiative to work. An agricultural cooperative here accumulated more than 5,000 dan (a unit of dry measure) of manure in ten days by sweeping the streets, sweeping indoor dust, digging chicken manure, removing manure from toilets, and using it as bedding. Their wheat generally received a top dressing. The whole township promoted their experience, and the manure accumulation and sanitation campaign quickly unfolded.

    It is easy to start a sanitation campaign, but difficult to consolidate it. However, these townships have already found the key to solving this difficulty. They have adopted the method of gradual progress, step-by-step improvement, and constantly proposing new content for the sanitation campaign, so that one upsurge follows another in advancing the campaign. For example, after fully mobilizing the masses, Jingdian Township first carried out environmental sanitation improvement, raising the roadbed of the streets, digging drainage ditches, and launching the "Nine Digs," "Eight Fillings," "Five Sweeps," "Four Cleans," "Three No-Leaves," and "Four Strips and Four Exchanges" manure accumulation campaign. This not only improved sanitation but also accumulated fertilizer and increased production. (The "Nine Digs" mainly refer to digging the bottom of manure piles, sludge pits, grinding wheel areas, toilet surroundings, sheep pen bottoms, chicken coop manure, cattle pens, pig pens, and old house soil. Except for sludge pits which are not filled, the rest are for the "Eight Fillings." The "Five Sweeps" are: sweeping the streets, courtyards, houses, walls, and roofs, and sweeping dead corners; achieving clean streets, clean courtyards, clean houses, and clean dead corners. "Three No-Leaves" means no bricks and gravel left on the streets, no garbage left in dead corners, and no old dust left in the houses. "Four Strips and Four Exchanges" are: stripping old walls and replacing them with new walls, stripping old stoves and replacing them with new stoves, stripping old roofs and replacing them with new roofs, and stripping old kangs (heated brick beds) and replacing them with new kangs.)

    On the basis of improving environmental sanitation and improving streets, they continued to improve toilets and strengthen manure management. In order to completely eliminate flies, they also promoted a "Five-Haves, Three-Nos" inspection system (the "Five Haves" are: toilets have fly swatters, brooms, wooden lids, washbasins, and push boards (for removing garbage), and the "Three Nos" are: no maggots, no flies, and no garbage in the toilets). Toilets are swept once a day, manure is removed once every ten days, maggots are killed once every five days, and flies are killed whenever they are seen. This not only ensured the basic elimination of fly pupae but also accumulated more fertilizer, ensuring the quality of the fertilizer, killing two birds with one stone. In two years, 423 of the 563 toilets in Jingdian Township have been improved to meet the standards.

    In order to improve the hygiene of the kitchens, the "Three Improvements" method was promoted in the kitchen of each member, adding cupboards, dish racks, and chopstick bags. Each person has a chopstick bag and should not use it indiscriminately, changing the bad habit of placing bowls and chopsticks randomly. Chimneys were added to direct the smoke from burning firewood to the outside, to prevent coal gas poisoning. In addition, the wells were renovated. In addition to generally raising the well platform, the wellhead was also raised, waterwheels were installed, the wellhead was sealed, and a water use system was established to maintain clean drinking water.

    In terms of improving the environmental hygiene of livestock sheds, Jingdian and other townships are currently promoting the "Three Diligences and Five Cleans" system (namely, diligent removal of manure, diligent bedding of soil, diligent sweeping, clean grass, clean feed, clean water, clean troughs, and clean livestock).

    In addition, they have also added many tools for eliminating the four pests and created many methods for eliminating the four pests.

    The reason why the eliminate-four-pests and promote-hygiene campaign in these townships has been able to persist is because they have grasped the following key points:

    1. The purpose of carrying out the sanitation campaign is clear, and the combination of production and sanitation is good. Their slogan is to start from production, eliminate the four pests, and change the environmental sanitation by accumulating fertilizer. Since the launch of the sanitation campaign in Daye Town, the source of fertilizer has greatly increased. In 1956, each mu (a unit of area) had 16 dan more fertilizer than in 1955, accumulating more than 80,000 dan of manure, and the annual grain output also increased from 393 jin (a unit of weight) in 1955 to 460 jin. According to statistics from Jingdian Township, the number of patients in the past two years has generally decreased by 44% compared with the past, and the incidence of disease has decreased by more than 520 person-times compared with the previous two years. This not only reduced the disease burden but also helped to increase production. Their method of combining hygiene and production is: unified organizational leadership (the production team leader also serves as the hygiene team leader), unified planning (the annual plan, seasonal plan, and short-term plan all include sanitation and manure accumulation content), unified deployment (actions are also unified), and unified inspection and evaluation. In this way, the tendency of sanitation being a single task is fundamentally prevented, ensuring the healthy development of the campaign under leadership.

    2. Adhere to the principle of running the sanitation undertaking diligently and frugally, relying on the masses and believing that the masses can run the sanitation undertaking themselves. More than 80% of the tools for catching sparrows and rats and fly swatters are created by the masses themselves. Improving the hygiene of streets, kitchens, diets, water wells, toilets, residences, and livestock sheds all relies on the strength of the masses and does not require the state to spend money.

    3. Sanitation publicity and education work is the foundation for carrying out the sanitation campaign. They are not only organized through recounting past sufferings and networking, but more importantly, the publicity work is in-depth, and everyone understands basic health knowledge. In addition to regular publicity in primary schools and people's schools, the fields and dining areas are also often places for discussing health knowledge.

    4. The masses themselves formulate sanitary regulations and consciously abide by them. When influenza was prevalent last spring, they established epidemic inspection posts and implemented traffic quarantine. If a patient was found, they would promptly treat them and put up a yellow flag in front of their house so that the masses would know that there was a patient in this house and implement isolation. In March of the year before last, a worker from Zhengzhou was found to have flu symptoms when he returned home and walked to the entrance of Jingdian Village. He was not allowed to enter the village. After disinfection, he was given a mask and sent to his home by a doctor. The worker was only allowed to go out after he recovered. In addition, they have also established a cleaning system, a manure management system, a water well management system, a drinking water disinfection system, and the "Three Diligences and Five Cleans" system for breeding farms, etc. Currently, these systems have been consciously and voluntarily observed by the masses and are constantly being improved.

    Now, the sanitation campaign in these townships is still continuing, in order to further thoroughly eliminate the four pests.

    登封县四个乡卫生运动坚持两年如一日
    处处干干净净整整齐齐
    身入其境，人心清爽，精神振奋
    本报讯　河南登封县景店、唐庄、玉台、大冶四乡，已基本上消灭了四害。
    这四个乡过去卫生基础很差，家家户户门口都有粪堆，街上压着路肥，道路高低不平，到处都是砖瓦乱石，雨后满街脏水，各户的厕所积满了粪尿，雨后到处乱流。不少群众一到夏秋季节，泻肚痢疾病到处流行，疟疾更是不隔门（意思是家家户户都有），景店乡1951年就有三百二十三人害痢疾病，占该乡总人数的11％左右。
    可是，从1955年冬开展除四害、讲卫生运动以后，现在，这四个乡已成了卫生模范乡。他们基本上做到了不见鼠洞，不见雀窝，茅缸不见蛆，住室不见蚊蝇，床下不见灰土，街上不见垃圾，不见杂草碎石，锅台上不见灰，井台上不见泥水。走到这几个乡，就可以看到清洁整齐的街道，大街小巷经常扫的干干净净，不少户门上贴上了清洁无蝇户的光荣喜报，或插上了卫生先进红旗，垃圾箱和太平水缸都建立起来了。家家户户的伙房住室整理的有条有理，炊具洗刷的非常清洁，厕所大部分改良加盖，不论房屋好坏，衣服破旧，各种各样的东西，都是整齐清洁的。身入其境，真使人心清爽，精神振奋。
    1955年冬，这几个乡发动除四害、讲卫生运动的时候，有不少群众风言风语的说：“光讲卫生地里不打粮食，也当不住饿掉大牙。”很多干部、党团员也缺乏信心。在这种情况下，只有从培养典型，重点作起，以点带面，逐步开展。如景店乡在党支部的统一领导下，确定以景店村为重点，景店村又以北街为重点，经过串连发动，诉苦对比，以及医生在治病时，普遍进行卫生宣传教育。中医李修通过给王海龙治痢疾，宣传痢疾是怎样传染的，并帮助他家里整理了家务、炊具、打扫了屋院，感动的他也讲起卫生来了，他到处宣传开了，带动北街四十二户都行动起来。南街的人看到北街行动了，也就主动的干起来了。这里的一个农业社通过扫街道，扫屋内陈灰，挖鸡粪、厕所、出粪、垫圈，十天就积了五千多担粪，他们的小麦，普遍上了一次追肥。全乡推广了他们的经验，积肥卫生运动就很快开展起来。
    卫生运动开展容易巩固难，但是，这几个乡却已经摸到解决这一困难的窍门。他们采取了循序渐进，步步提高，不断的提出卫生运动的新内容的办法，使运动一个高潮跟着一个高潮的向前发展着。如景店乡充分发动了群众以后，首先进行改进环境卫生，街道普遍的抬高了路基，挖了排水渠，开展了“九挖”、“八垫”、“五扫”、“四净”、“三不留”和“四扒四换”的积肥运动，不仅改善了卫生、而且积了肥，增加了生产。（九挖主要是：粪堆底、污泥坑、磨道圈、厕所周围、羊圈底、鸡窝粪、牛圈、猪圈、老房土，除了污泥坑不填外，其余为八垫。五扫是：街道、院里、屋内、墙壁、房顶、扫死角；作到街净、院净、屋净、死角净。三不留是：街上不留砖瓦碎石，死角不留垃圾，屋内不留陈灰。四扒四换是：扒旧墙换新墙，扒旧锅台换新锅台，扒旧屋顶换新屋顶，扒旧炕换新炕。）
    在改进环境卫生、改良街道的基础上，他们又继续进行改良厕所，加强粪便管理的工作。为了彻底消灭蝇子，还推广了五有、三无的检查制度（五有即：厕所有蝇拍、有扫帚、有木盖、有洗手盆、推板（除垃圾用的），三无是厕所内无蛆、无蝇、无垃圾），一天扫一次厕所，十天出一次粪，五天杀一次蛆，见蝇子就打。这不仅保证了基本上消灭了蝇蛹，并且又多积了肥，保证了肥料的质量，一举两利。两年中，景店乡的五百六十三个厕所已经改良合乎标准的有四百二十三个。
    为了讲求伙房的卫生，对社员各户的伙房推广了“三改良”的办法，增设了碗橱、碗架和筷袋，每人一个筷袋，不要乱用，改变了放碗筷子的坏习惯。增设了烟筒，使烧火的烟通向外边，以防止煤烟中毒。并且改造了水井，除了普遍加高井台以外，还重点的加高了井口，安装了水车，封闭了井口，规定了用水制度，保持了饮水清洁。
    在改良畜舍的环境卫生方面，景店等乡目前正在推广三勤五净的制度（即勤出粪，勤垫土、勤扫地，草净、料净、水净、槽净、牲畜身上净）。
    此外，他们还增设很多除四害的工具，创造很多除四害的办法。
    这几个乡的除四害、讲卫生运动所以能够坚持下来，是由于他们抓住了如下几个关键：
    1、开展卫生运动的目的明确，生产、卫生结合的好。他们的口号是从生产出发，消灭四害，从积肥入手，改变环境卫生。大冶镇自开展卫生运动后，大大增加了肥源，1956年就比1955年每亩地多施肥十六担，多积八万余担粪，粮食年产也由1955年的三百九十三斤提高到四百六十斤。据景店乡的统计，两年来患病人数一般比过去减少了44％，比上两年减少发病五百二十余人次，这不仅减少了疾病负担，并且有利于增加生产。他们使卫生和生产结合的方法是：统一组织领导（生产队长兼卫生组长），统一计划（常年计划、季节计划和小段计划都有卫生积肥内容），统一布置（行动也统一），统一检查评比，这样就从根本上防止了卫生单打一的倾向的产生，保证运动有领导的健康发展。
    2、坚持了勤俭办卫生事业的方针，依靠群众、相信群众自己会办卫生事业。捕雀捕鼠工具和蝇子拍，80％以上都是群众自己创制成的。改良街道、伙房、饮食、水井、厕所、住室、畜舍的卫生，都是依靠群众力量，用不着国家花钱。
    3、卫生宣传教育工作，是开展卫生运动的基础。他们不仅通过诉苦、串连组织起来，更重要的是宣传工作深入，人人都懂得卫生常识。除了小学、民校经常进行宣传以外，就是地头、饭场也经常是谈论卫生知识的场所。
    4、群众自己规定卫生制度，自觉遵守。去春流行性感冒发生时，他们就建立了疫情检查哨，实行了交通检疫，发现有病人，一方面抓紧治疗，一方面给他家门口插上一个黄旗，群众就知道这家有了病人，实行隔离。前年3月，郑州一个工人回家走到景店村口，就被检查出有流感病状，不准入村，后经过消毒，给他戴了一个口罩，由医生送到他家，这个工人病好后，才被允许出门。此外，他们还建立了清扫制度，粪便管理制度，水井管理制度，饮水消毒制度，饲养院的三勤五净制度，等等。目前这些制度已经为群众自觉自愿的遵守了，并且还不断的改进提高。
    现在，这几个乡的卫生运动还在继续前进，以便进一步彻底消灭四害。
