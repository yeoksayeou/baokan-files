    Why Waste Foreign Exchange

    The Guangzhou Customs and China Resources Company reported that from the third quarter of 1956, some foreign trade port branches, due to a lack of planning and a bureaucratic attitude in using foreign exchange, bought back goods that had already been exported from Hong Kong, resulting in a loss of national foreign exchange. For example: the Shanghai Native Produce Export Company imported × kilograms of musk from Xikang from Hong Kong; the Guangzhou Jointly-operated Medicinal Materials Export Company imported × kilograms of Henan native produce rehmannia glutinosa in two batches; the Taiping Native Produce Export Branch imported × tons of domestically produced glazed paper that we had already exported; the Shantou Drawnwork Company imported × bolts of cotton cloth exported by Shanghai; the Shenzhen Fruit and Vegetable Export Branch imported × batches of mustard seeds that China had already exported; and the Guangzhou Metals Import and Export Company imported angle steel, round steel, and flat steel of similar quality to our exports.

    These few items alone wasted approximately 600,000 to 700,000 Hong Kong dollars of national foreign exchange. In addition, it increased the round-trip freight and Hong Kong merchants' profits, and also created a negative political impact abroad.

    What is more serious is that after the Ministry of Foreign Trade publicly criticized the Shenzhen Food Export Company in mid-September of last year for purchasing China's exported goods from Hong Kong, similar incidents occurred again.

    Our foreign exchange is an important source for socialist construction. Every foreign trade salesperson should cherish this hard-earned foreign exchange. Relevant foreign trade bureaus and customs at all levels should strictly adhere to the principles recently communicated by the Ministry of Foreign Trade. It is hoped that the relevant parties will learn from this lesson and prevent such wasteful use of foreign exchange from happening again.

### 为什么要浪费外汇

    为什么要浪费外汇
    广州海关和华润公司反映：自1956年三季度起，在一年当中某些外贸口岸分支机构，由于工作上缺乏计划，以官僚主义态度来运用外汇，把已出口的物资又从香港买回来，使国家外汇遭到损失。例如：上海土产出口公司从香港进口西康麝香×公斤；广州合营药材出口公司先后二次进口河南土产生地×公斤；太平土产出口支公司进口我已出口的国产腊光纸×吨；汕头抽纱公司进口上海出口的棉布×匹；深圳果菜出口支公司进口了我国已出口的芥菜种子×批；广州五金进出口公司进口与我出口相似品质的角钢、元钢、扁钢等。
    仅以上这几笔物资，即浪费了国家外汇约六、七十万元港币。此外，还增加了这批物资的往返运费和港商利润，同时在国外政治上也造成了不好的影响。
    严重的是个别单位在中央外贸部去年9月中旬通报批评了深圳食品出口公司从香港购买我国出口货事件以后，又发生了类似事件。
    我国的外汇是社会主义建设的重要来源。每个外贸业务员应珍惜我们这些来之不易的外汇。有关各级外贸局，海关等更应严格掌握中央外贸部最近通报的原则。希望有关方面，吸取教训，不要再让这种浪费外汇的现象发生。
