As long as you are serious, you can do it well
    ——On the patriotic health campaign of the Industrial Work Department of the CPC Central Committee
                Our reporter Dai Yue
    The health work of the Industrial Work Department of the CPC Central Committee is a model of transformation from backwardness to advancement. When I visited this unit, my first impression was that the buildings were clean everywhere. Although the wind was blowing at the time, there was no dust flying around. This unit is a combination of offices and dormitories, with more than 100 households and a total of more than 1,200 employees and family members. Everything inside and outside the house is in good order, and the doors, windows, tables, chairs, floors, and walls of each room are spotless. It makes people feel refreshed everywhere.

  Unhealthy places become model health units
    The comrade in charge of the administrative office introduced to me: A year ago, this place was still a place with garbage all over the courtyard and a concentration of infectious diseases, and it had been criticized by the health department. In the spring of 1956, measles, scarlet fever, influenza, and other diseases occurred one after another. Many adults and children fell ill, and people went to the hospital for emergency treatment every day. There were not enough cars, and the drivers were too busy. Medical expenses were overspent every month, and staff members could not go to work for one or two weeks because their children were sick, which seriously affected the work and health of many people.
    Health work attracted the attention of the leaders of the department. Liu Yangqiao, Secretary-General of the General Office, called on all staff members at a conference: "List health work as one of the main projects of current work. The quality of health work is a sign of the degree of civilization in the life of the organization." Under the call of the leaders, all staff members took active action and set up a full-time cadre to be responsible for the health work of the organization. In May 1956, a Patriotic Health Committee was established. The members of the committee were the responsible comrades of various grassroots units, and were personally led by the responsible comrades of the General Office. The dormitory established a family committee (the members were selected from the nannies and family members, all of whom were activists in health work). Seven health teams were also established in units such as dormitories, official classes, cleaning classes, canteens, kindergartens, boiler rooms, and motorcade. Each team formulated health covenants based on different situations, inspected each other, and held regular meetings to study problems.
    All problems found during inspections can be solved in a timely manner. For example, the canteen has a large number of people eating, and the canteen has insufficient manpower, so the sanitation work is not done well, and the system and covenants are just a formality. Flies and mice in the kitchen fly and run freely, and cockroaches are often found in the food. In order to thoroughly improve the sanitation of the canteen, the leaders held several meetings in a row, mobilizing all staff members to do a thorough cleaning. The labor enthusiasm of the masses was very high. They brushed tables, wiped floors, plugged rat holes, and disinfected the room. Through everyone's efforts, the sanitation work of the canteen was laid a foundation, and from then on the sanitation covenant system of the canteen was truly realized.
    When I visited the canteen, the chefs were preparing lunch. Their white coats and hats were washed clean, their fingernails were cut short, and the chefs who made the dishes also wore masks. The doors and windows of the canteen were very bright and clean, there was no dust on the ceiling and floor, there was no dirt on the tables and benches, and the tableware on the tables was also arranged very beautifully. The red flag hanging on the wall and the silver bottle placed in the glass cabinet were both health model awards won last year. In the suggestion book, a comrade wrote: Now, when you enter the canteen, you feel comfortable and refreshed, which stimulates your appetite; in the past, when you entered the canteen, you felt dirty and sick, and you didn't want to eat anything.
    In the dormitory, when you walk into each room, the doors and windows are as bright as a mirror, the floor is bright and shiny, and the furniture is arranged very neatly. The clothes of the children's nannies are clean. It's hard to tell which family is better.
    Soon, I came to the home of Liu Xinrong, a member of the Health Committee. She was helping an old lady clean the kitchen. I asked her to talk about the health work in the dormitory. She introduced it to me like this: In the past, everyone lived in beautiful buildings, but they didn't have good hygiene habits. For example, this flowered tile corridor was covered with mud. The bed was covered with a flowered sheet, and under the bed were broken shoes and socks, with a thick layer of dust. In winter, the doors and windows were tightly closed, and the children's diapers were dried on the radiator without washing them with water. The smell of poop and urine in the room hit the nose. When the health work started, we encountered many difficulties: the cadres emphasized that they were busy with work and study, the nannies said they didn't have time to take care of the children and cook, and many nannies had complex ideas, were not settled in their work, and had a high turnover rate. Some people didn't have enough understanding of health work, saying that if you were supposed to get sick, you couldn't run away, and not paying attention to hygiene wouldn't kill anyone; others said they were willing to pay attention to hygiene, but they didn't know how to do it. The leaders seriously studied these ideological problems and carried out work through the family committee, paying attention to discovering activists. They cultivated activists and promoted activists to carry out publicity and education to the masses anytime and anywhere. They also carried out criticism and praise through blackboard newspapers and cartoons in a planned way. In order to enrich everyone's hygiene knowledge, they organized hygiene lectures and held picture exhibitions on prevention of infectious diseases, maternal and child hygiene, and food hygiene. Through various publicity and education activities, everyone had a correct understanding of health work, and the health work in the dormitory gradually started. Each team formulated health covenants, stipulated inspection systems, and carried out criticism and praise. After doing this for a period of time, a sudden campaign was formed. When it came to inspection, everyone was so tired that they were sweating profusely, and after the inspection, everything remained the same, and they could not maintain regular hygiene. The family committee pointed out: To achieve regular hygiene, it is necessary to emphasize that everyone develops regular hygiene habits. According to the new requirements, everyone also supervised each other and checked at any time.

  Family members and nannies participate, health work is regularized
    When the comrades of the family committee introduced the situation to me, they especially mentioned the work of the nanny Wang Guizhen. When I visited Wang Guizhen, she was wearing a white apron and feeding the child. When she saw me, she enthusiastically introduced her work to me: She takes care of four children, and her work is relatively busy. In the past, she was even more busy and chaotic because she didn't have a plan for her work. There were scraps of paper, random things, and rice spilled by the children everywhere inside and outside the house. Over time, not paying attention to hygiene became a habit. Because the living environment was not clean, the child often got sick, and she was busy going to the hospital to register and see a doctor all day long, and she didn't have time to clean up the garbage. When it was her turn to be on duty in the kitchen shared by several families, it was so dirty that she couldn't get her feet down. When this happened, the health activists in the dormitory would clean up for her. When they inspected the dormitory hygiene, everyone gave her suggestions, and she herself didn't know what to do. The activists came to help her thoroughly clean the dormitory hygiene, and showed her how to do everything. The comrades of the family committee also calculated how much time she had to do hygiene work in a day and helped her arrange a week's hygiene work plan. Everyone's enthusiastic help moved her very much. Every day, she carried out her work according to the plan: she cooked and cleaned the kitchen in the morning, took care of the children and handled other housework after breakfast, and washed clothes after the children went to bed after dinner. In this way, Wang Guizhen's unhygienic situation quickly changed, the child no longer got sick, her work became easier and easier, and the hygiene became better and better every day. There are more than just one example like Wang Guizhen.
    Liu Xinrong pointed to the two- or three-year-old child playing on the ground and said: "Now, even children as big as this in our dormitory know how to pay attention to hygiene. They can automatically throw the leftover fruit peels into the trash can. Older children can abide by the living system." She pointed to a chart posted on the wall and said: "This is the children's living system chart, which includes: work and rest time, dressing, folding quilts, washing faces, gargling, and bathing and changing clothes on time. According to the living system chart, the nanny gives scores every day; if there are more than two children, they compete with each other, and each child strives to get five points." This method cultivates the children's independent living ability and also develops hygiene habits. Adults have more time to do other things, avoiding busy and chaotic phenomena, taking good care of the children, and also doing a good job in hygiene. Due to the active lead of the nannies and children, the cadres' dependence mentality has also changed. Deng Zhi, the director of the administrative office, cleans and scrubs his room every day after returning home from work. Zhang Li's mother is very clean, and she used to rely on the nanny to do it. Now she does it herself. Every Sunday, she first helps the nanny clean the house, and then handles other housework when she has time.

  Doctors walk out of the health room, and the inspection is in-depth and specific
    The health work of the Industrial Work Department of the CPC Central Committee is carried out well, and the comrades in the health room also play a great role in addition to the attention of the leaders. Dr. Zhang Youfang said: In the past, treating patients in the health room all day long was never enough; no matter how good the treatment effect was, it was not as good as not getting sick. He was determined to walk out of the health room and go to every corner of the organization to carry out disease prevention publicity and education work. He found that the canteen's sanitation was not done well, so he wrote a big-character poster and posted it at the entrance of the canteen: "The canteen sanitation is relatively poor, everything is arranged in a mess, the bowls and chopsticks are not washed clean, the clay pots and oil stains are not wiped, the implementation of the covenant is not enough, the completion of the task is owed to inspection, I advise comrades to work hard together, and add oil especially in the future." A big-character poster attracted the attention of many people. The canteen added a suggestion book, and opinions could be written at any time, which played a role in collective supervision, and the unsanitary situation of the canteen quickly changed. When Dr. Zhang Youfang went to the dormitory to understand the situation, he heard some people say that doing hygiene requires strong physical strength, but we women don't have that much strength. At the same time, he found that an old lady in her seventies was doing a very good job in hygiene, so he criticized and praised these two typical examples at a family meeting. Dr. Zhang compiled a jingle and read it to everyone: "Seventy-year-old Li Ming, the old lady, is strong in cleaning and hygiene, the windows are bright and the table is spotless, and the table is wiped on all six sides." This had a very good effect, both setting an example and explaining the problem, and those who were criticized were also convinced. Dr. Zhang saw sputum stains on the ground in the courtyard, so he wrote several big-character posters and posted them on wooden frames, standing next to the sidewalk. At noon when people got off work, many people gathered around to watch. This was a big-character poster of the ground speaking: "I have never washed my face for more than a year. Comrades' phlegm and snot have been smeared all over my face. It is really ugly. When exposed to sunlight, bacteria spread, and when the wind blows, they drill into your respiratory tract with the dust. I don't care what disease you get. I have issued a warning. Please wash my face often, and we will all be safe." Zhang Youfang found that the service class was very active in sanitation work, so he praised it in a timely manner: "The service class with the greatest effort, cleaning and hygiene at night, helping each other to compete, see who is ahead in the score, discussing shortcomings and quickly correcting them, absorbing experience and studying hard, uniting to work together, a new victory is about to begin."
    In order to arouse the masses' attention to hygiene work and develop hygiene habits, Dr. Zhang carried out hygiene publicity and education work anytime and anywhere. When going to the dormitory for diagnosis or inspection visits, he walked and watched, and pointed out the unsanitary phenomena in a timely manner. When a nanny brought a child to see a doctor, Dr. Zhang checked the hygiene of the nanny and the child on the spot. If the nanny's fingernails were long, he told her to cut them short. If he saw that the child's skin was not clean, he told her to give the child a bath. The comrades of the family committee said: "Dr. Zhang's work is very in-depth. He often comes to the dormitory to guide the hygiene work. He can call out the names of every child in the dormitory. He understands the child's living environment and constantly reminds the nanny how to take care of the child. Whenever an infectious disease is prevalent, Dr. Zhang stays in the dormitory all day long, conducting inspections and early preventive vaccinations. Once an infectious disease is discovered, it is strictly isolated. Dr. Zhang's hygiene publicity work has truly achieved that everyone knows and every household understands." The result of paying attention to hygiene is that everyone is healthy. The number of people getting sick has been greatly reduced. From April to July 1956, the number of children who contracted infectious diseases among more than 500 children was 111. From April to July 1957, the number of children who contracted diseases was reduced to 17.

    只要认真就能做好
    ——记中共中央工业工作部的爱国卫生工作
                本报记者　戴月
    中共中央工业工作部的卫生工作，是由落后转变为先进的范例。当记者去访问这个单位的时候，第一个印象就是楼房周围到处都干干净净，当时虽然刮着风，这里却看不到飞起的灰尘。这个单位是办公室和宿舍连在一起，有一百多住户，职工、家属共一千二百多人。屋里屋外一切东西都是井井有条，每间房子的门窗、桌椅、地板、墙壁都是四面见光。处处使人感到清新爽快。
  不卫生的地方变成卫生模范单位
    行政处的负责同志向我介绍：一年前这里还是个垃圾满院，传染病集中的地方，曾经受过卫生部门的批评。1956年春，麻疹、猩红热、流行性感冒等陆续发生，大人孩子病倒很多，每天有人进医院看急诊，汽车不够用，司机也忙不过来，医药费每月超支，工作人员因为小孩生病一两个星期不能上班，严重的影响到很多人的工作和健康。
    卫生工作引起了部里领导同志的注意，办公厅刘仰桥秘书长在全体工作人员大会上号召：“把卫生工作列为当前工作的主要项目之一。卫生工作的好坏，是标志着机关生活的文明程度。”在领导的号召下，全体工作人员积极行动起来，并设一专职干部负责机关卫生工作。1956年5月成立了爱国卫生委员会，委员会的成员是各基层的负责同志，由办公厅的负责同志亲自领导。宿舍成立了家属委员会（委员是从保姆家属中选出来的，都是卫生工作的积极分子）。还以宿舍、公务班、清扫班、食堂、幼儿园、锅炉房、汽车队等单位成立了七个卫生小组。各小组根据不同情况制定了卫生公约，互相检查，定期开会研究问题。
    凡是检查出来的问题都能及时解决。如食堂，吃饭的人很多，食堂人力不足，卫生工作作的不好，制度、公约流于形式。厨房里的苍蝇、老鼠自由自在的飞来跑去，饭菜里经常吃出蟑螂来。为了彻底搞好食堂卫生，领导上接连几次开会，发动全体工作人员亲自动手大扫除，群众的劳动情绪很高，刷桌子、擦地板、堵鼠洞、室内消毒等，经过大家的努力，给食堂的卫生工作打下了基础，从此食堂的卫生公约制度才真正的实现了。
    记者参观食堂的时候，厨师们正在准备开午饭，他们身上的白衣帽洗得干干净净，手指甲都剪得很短，作菜的厨师还戴着口罩。食堂的门窗都非常明净，天棚、地板上也没有灰尘，桌凳上没有一点污垢，桌上的食具也摆得很好看，墙上挂着的那面红旗和玻璃柜上放着的银瓶，都是去年得的卫生模范奖。在意见簿上一位同志写道：现在一进食堂就感到舒适爽快，引起食欲；过去一进食堂，就感到垢污恶心，不想吃东西。
    在宿舍里，走到每个屋子都是门窗明如镜，地板亮又光，家具也都摆得很整齐。孩子保姆的衣服都是干干净净。简直使你分不清谁家更好些。
    不一会儿来到了卫生委员刘新荣的家里，她正在帮助一位老大娘打扫厨房。我就请她谈谈宿舍的卫生工作，她这样向我介绍：过去大家住在漂亮的楼房里，可是没有个好的卫生习惯，就像这个花瓷砖的走廊都被泥土给盖住了。床上铺着花单子，床底下就是破鞋烂袜子，灰尘很厚，一到冬天就把门窗关紧，孩子的尿布不用水洗就搭在暖气上烤，屋里的屎味尿味直冲鼻子。卫生工作开始时遇到很多困难：干部强调工作、学习忙，保姆说带孩子做饭没时间，又加上许多保姆思想复杂，不安心工作，流动性很大，有的人对卫生工作认识不足，说该得病怎么也跑不了，不讲卫生也死不了人；有的说愿意讲卫生，就是不知道怎么作。领导上认真的研究了这些思想问题，并通过家属委员会进行工作，注意发现积极分子。培养积极分子，推动积极分子随时随地向群众进行宣传教育。并有计划的通过黑板报、漫画开展批评、表扬。为了丰富大家的卫生常识，组织卫生讲座、举办预防传染病和妇幼卫生、饮食卫生等图片展览。通过各种宣传教育，大家对卫生工作有了正确的认识，宿舍的卫生工作逐渐的开展起来了。各小组订立了卫生公约，规定了检查制度，进行了批评和表扬。这样作了一个时期又形成了突击运动，到检查的时候大家就累得满头大汗，检查过去就依然如故，不能保持经常卫生。家属委员会指出：要作到卫生经常化，就要强调每个人养成经常的卫生习惯。根据新的要求，大家又作到了互相监督，随时检查。
  家属保姆都参加，卫生工作经常化
    家属委员会的同志向我介绍情况时，特别提到了保姆王桂珍的工作。我去访问王桂珍的时候，她正戴着白围裙给孩子喂饭，看我来了，就热情的向我介绍她的工作情况：她看着四个孩子，工作比较忙，过去工作没有计划就更忙乱，屋里屋外都是碎纸乱东西和孩子们撒的饭，日子久了，不讲卫生就成了习惯。生活环境不干净，孩子就经常生病，她整天忙着去医院挂号看病，更没有时间打扫垃圾。几家共用的厨房，轮到她值日的时候，就脏得不能下脚。遇到这种情况，宿舍里的卫生工作积极分子就去替她打扫。到互相检查宿舍卫生的时候，大家都给她提意见，她自己也不知道怎样才好。积极分子又来帮助她彻底打扫了宿舍卫生，处处都给她作个样子看。家属委员会的同志又给她计算了一天有多少时间搞卫生工作，并帮助她安排了一个星期的卫生工作计划。大家的热情帮助使她很感动，每天就按着计划进行工作：早晨起来一面做饭一面打扫厨房，早饭后就看孩子和料理其他家务，晚饭后孩子睡觉再洗衣服。这样，王桂珍的不卫生情况很快就改变了，孩子也不生病了，她的工作越来越轻松，卫生也一天比一天搞得好。像王桂珍这样的例子不止一个。
    刘新荣指着地上玩的那个两三岁的孩子说：“现在我们宿舍里连这么大的孩子也知道讲卫生。他们吃剩下的果皮都能自动的丢在垃圾筐里。再大一点的孩子就能作到遵守生活制度”。她指着墙上贴着的一张表说：“这是孩子们的生活制度表，内容包括：作息时间、穿衣、叠被、洗脸、漱口、按时洗澡换衣。根据生活制度表，阿姨每天给记分；有两个孩子以上的就互相比赛，每个孩子都争取得个五分。”这个办法培养了孩子的独立生活能力，同时也养成了卫生习惯。大人就有更多的时间干别的事情，避免了忙乱现象，既带好了孩子，又搞好了卫生。由于保姆、孩子的积极带头，干部的依赖思想也就转变了。行政处的邓志处长每天下班回家后，都打扫和擦洗自己的房间。张力的妈妈很爱干净，过去都是靠保姆作，现在是亲自动手，每当星期天她先帮助保姆打扫屋子，有时间才处理其他家务事。
  医生走出保健室，检查深入又具体
    中共中央工业部的卫生工作开展得好，除了领导的重视，保健室的同志也起了很大的作用。张有方大夫说：过去整天坐在保健室里治病也治不完；不论治疗的效果多么好，也不如不得病。他下决心走出保健室，到机关各个角落，进行疾病的预防宣传教育工作。他发现食堂的卫生作不好，就及时写了一张大字报，贴在食堂门口：“食堂卫生比较差，一切安排乱如麻，碗筷洗的不干净，沙锅油泥也未擦，执行公约还不够，完成任务欠检查，奉劝同志齐努力，今后特别把油加。”一张大字报引起了许多人的注意，食堂增加了意见簿，有意见可以随时写上，起到了集体的监督作用，食堂的不卫生情况很快就有了改变。张有方大夫到宿舍了解情况时，听到有的人说搞卫生需要体力强，咱们妇女可没有那么大的劲。同时发现一位七十多岁的老大娘卫生工作作得很好，就在一次家属会上对这两个典型进行了批评表扬。张大夫编了顺口溜念给大家听：“七旬李明老大娘，清洁卫生搞的强，窗明几净无尘土，桌子擦得六面光。”这样作的效果很好，既树立了榜样又说明了问题，受批评的也心悦诚服。张大夫在院子里看到地上有痰迹，就写了几张大字报，贴在木架上，竖在甬道旁。中午下班的时候，许多人围着看，这是一张地皮说话的大字报：“我一年多从来就没洗过一次脸，同志们的粘痰鼻涕吐了我满脸，实在难看，被太阳光一晒细菌分散，风一吹，随尘土钻到你的呼吸道里边，得了什么病我不管，我提出了警告，请你们常常给我洗脸，咱们就各得所安。”张有方发现服务班的卫生工作很积极，他就及时的表扬：“劲头最大的服务班，打扫卫生在夜间，互相帮助来竞赛，看看分数谁在先，讨论缺点迅速改，吸取经验又钻研，团结作到齐努力，新的胜利即开端”。
    为了引起群众重视卫生工作，养成卫生习惯，张大夫是随时随地地进行卫生宣传教育工作。到宿舍出诊或访视检查的时候，他一边走一边看，看到不卫生的现象就及时指出来。保姆带着孩子看病的时候，张大夫当时就检查保姆和孩子的卫生，保姆的指甲长了就告诉她剪短，看到孩子身上皮肤不干净就告诉她给洗澡。家属委员会的同志说：“张大夫的工作非常深入，他经常到宿舍来指导卫生工作。宿舍里每个孩子的名字他都能叫出来，他了解孩子的生活环境，不断提醒保姆应该怎样照护孩子。每当传染病流行时，张大夫就整天不离宿舍，进行检查、早期预防注射，一旦发现传染病就严格隔离，张大夫的卫生宣传工作真正作到了人人皆知户户皆晓。”讲卫生的结果是人人健康。得病的人数大大减少了。1956年4月到7月，在五百多个孩子中得传染病的人数是一百一十一人，1957年4月到7月得病的孩子就降低到十七人。
