　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 22nd: Soviet Deputy Doctor of Technical Sciences, Hint, has developed a building material called "siliceous calcite." This material is made from one part lime and nine parts sand, and its strength exceeds that of cement, while its cost is lower than that of brick.

　　Hint's research revealed that lime and sand cannot fully combine because ordinary sand surfaces have a layer of carbonate compounds with very poor chemical activity. He invented a special grinding and mixing device. A certain proportion of slaked lime and sand are placed in this device, which rotates at 1,000 to 1,500 revolutions per minute. The outer shell of the sand is removed, the sand is ground finer, and it is mixed with the lime indistinguishably, resulting in a new substance: siliceous calcite.

　　The disadvantage of this material is that it must be hardened under steam treatment conditions of 160 degrees Celsius and a pressure of eight atmospheres, so it must be used to make prefabricated components. Currently, Soviet scientists are studying how to manufacture siliceous calcite that can be hardened under normal conditions. Preliminary achievements have been made in this area. The samples they made reached a strength of withstanding 300 kilograms of pressure per square centimeter.

    苏联制成代替水泥的新材料
    坚固程度超过水泥，成本非常便宜
    据新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联技术科学副博士欣特制成了一种名叫硅方解石的建筑材料，这种材料是由一份石灰和九份砂子做成，其坚固程度超过水泥，而成本比砖还便宜。
    欣特经过研究发现，石灰同砂不能充分化合是因为在普通砂子表面有一层由化学活动能力极差的碳酸化合物组成的壳。他发明一种特制的研磨搅拌装置。把一定比例的熟石灰和砂子放入这个转速达每分钟一千到一千五百转的装置中，砂子的外壳被除去，砂子被研磨得更细小，同石灰搅拌得无法区分了，结果就形成一种新物质——硅方解石。
    这种材料的缺点是，要在温度一百六十度和压力为八个大气压的蒸气处理条件下才能进行硬化，因此要制成预制构件来使用。现在苏联科学家正在研究制造可以在普通条件下硬化的硅方解石。这方面也取得了初步成就。他们制成的样品达到了每平方公分可经受三百公斤压力的强度。
