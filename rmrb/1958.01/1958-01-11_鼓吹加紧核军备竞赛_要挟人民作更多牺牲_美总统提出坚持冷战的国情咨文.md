Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th: U.S. President Eisenhower presented his annual State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on the 9th. He emphasized that the U.S. government's "first task" this year is to strengthen its military "strength." He demanded that the American people make more "sacrifices" to support the government's program of stepping up the nuclear arms race as proposed in the address.

Eisenhower's address did not explain all aspects of U.S. policy as usual; this time, most of the content discussed measures aimed at strengthening military "strength."

Before the members of Congress, who were filled with frustration due to the Soviet satellite launch and the U.S. domestic economic recession, Eisenhower tried his best to make them have "confidence" to continue implementing the plan to strengthen military "strength." He boasted that the United States still possesses the so-called "deterrent force," but he then had to admit that "many Americans are uneasy about the recent developments in the world situation" and that "the United States lags slightly behind the Soviets in some aspects of the development of long-range ballistic missiles." He also boasted that the U.S. economy is "prosperous," but then had to say that the United States had "some declines in employment and production in the second half of last year." He also could not hide his deep anxiety about the growth of Soviet economic power. He described the Soviet Union's unconditional economic assistance to other countries as an "economic offensive," saying, "Obviously, most of us did not foresee the strong psychological impact of the launch of the first Earth satellite on the world." He believed that the "Soviet economic offensive" would have "much more serious effects."

After repeating the deceptive clichés of the so-called "communist threat," he put forward the U.S. plan to "accelerate" the nuclear arms race.

He said that the United States should "disperse offensive forces," "increase base facilities and personnel ready for combat at any time," especially to "speed up the implementation of long-range missile development programs" and manufacture "more advanced aircraft," build "nuclear submarines and cruisers," and "improve warning equipment," etc. At the same time, he said, the U.S. government should also maintain "various necessary types of mobile forces" to deal with so-called "local conflicts." He also mentioned that under the requirements of new military technology, the United States should establish "centralized leadership" of military organizations to try to "stop competition among the various military services."

Eisenhower emphasized the need to strengthen America's various military alliances. The United States should strengthen its foreign "aid" work. He stated that this work is important because the United States wants to continue to make its "allies" into anti-communist "fortresses." The United States should develop trade with its allies "so that American companies have the opportunity to develop around the world." He also advocated that Congress pass legislation so that the United States can exchange some scientific and technical intelligence with its allies.

Eisenhower estimated that in order to implement the U.S. government's arms expansion plan, an additional $1.3 billion in military appropriations would be needed for fiscal year 1958, and spending on strengthening "strength" in the fiscal year 1959 budget would increase by approximately $4 billion compared to the 1957 budget. He said that this would delay the implementation of some new non-military programs.

In the last part of his address, Eisenhower acknowledged that the people of all countries in the world "hope for peace," and there is only one solution to the major problems facing the world: "Countries should stop the current adventure of manufacturing more and more destructive weapons." Then, Eisenhower also said that he would carry out "peace work." He expressed his willingness to conduct cultural exchanges and contacts with the Soviet Union to promote mutual understanding, and he also talked about the possibility of implementing a plan for peaceful scientific cooperation among countries.

Eisenhower said, "In all peace work, what is most needed now is a real step toward disarmament." On the one hand, he said that after "coordinating the opinions" of the United States' allies, "we must listen to, discuss, and, if possible, negotiate any reasonable proposals that hold promise of leading to disarmament and easing the situation." However, at the same time, he reiterated that the United States still adheres to the old proposals it uses to obstruct the achievement of a disarmament agreement.

### 鼓吹加紧核军备竞赛　要挟人民作更多牺牲  美总统提出坚持冷战的国情咨文

    鼓吹加紧核军备竞赛　要挟人民作更多牺牲
    美总统提出坚持冷战的国情咨文
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔9日向国会两院联席会议提出一年一度的国情咨文。他强调美国政府今年施政的“第一个任务”是加强军事“实力”。他要求美国人民作出更多“牺牲”来支持咨文里提出的政府加紧核军备竞赛的纲领。
    艾森豪威尔这个咨文没有像往常那样说明美国政策的各个方面，这次绝大部分的篇幅都是谈论以加强军事“实力”为目的的种种措施。
    在由于苏联卫星上天和美国国内经济衰退而弥漫着沮丧情绪的国会议员面前，艾森豪威尔竭力要他们有“信心”来继续执行加强军事“实力”的计划。他吹嘘美国现在还拥有所谓“威慑力量”，但是他接着也不得不说，“许多美国人都对最近世界局势的发展感到不安”，“美国在远程弹道导弹发展的某些方面稍微落后于苏联人”。他还吹嘘美国经济是“繁荣”的，但是他接着又不得不说，美国去年“下半年在就业人数和产量方面有了一些下降”。他也无法掩饰对于苏联经济力量增长的深切不安。他把苏联对其他国家的不带条件的经济援助说成是“经济攻势”，他说，“显然，我们中间大多数人并没有预见到第一个地球卫星的发射对全世界的心理上的影响之强烈”，他认为“苏联经济攻势”还会有“更严重得多的影响”。
    他在重弹所谓“共产主义威胁”的骗人滥调后，提出了美国“加速”进行核军备竞赛的计划。
    他说，美国要“分散进攻部队”，“增加基地设备和准备随时作战的人员”，特别要“加紧实行发展远程导弹计划”和制造“更先进的飞机”，建造“核潜水舰和巡洋舰”，“改进警报设备”等。同时，他说，美国政府还要保有“各种必要类型的机动部队”来应付所谓“局部的冲突”。他还谈到，在新军事技术要求下，美国要建立军事组织的“集中领导”，来设法“停止各军种间的竞争”。
    艾森豪威尔强调，要加强美国的各个军事联盟。美国要加强对外“援助”的工作。他表明，这个工作之所以重要，是因为美国要把它的“盟国”继续成为反共的“堡垒”。美国要同盟国发展贸易，“使得美国企业有机会在全世界范围内发展”。他还主张国会通过法案，使得美国能同盟国交换一些科学和技术情报。
    艾森豪威尔估计，为了实行美国政府的扩军计划，1958财政年度要追加军事拨款十三亿美元，1959财政年度的预算里加强“实力”方面的开支将要比1957年预算增加约四十亿美元。他说，这样就将延期实行某些新的非军事计划。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文的最后一部分里承认，目前世界各国人民“希望和平”，对于世界面临的重大问题只有一个解决办法：“各国停止目前从事制造越来越多的毁灭性武器的冒险”。接着，艾森豪威尔也说要进行“和平工作”，他表示愿意同苏联进行文化交流和接触以促进相互了解，他还谈到可以实行各国科学和平合作的计划。
    艾森豪威尔说，“在一切和平工作中，现在最需要的是朝裁军方面走真正的一步”。他一方面说，在把美国的盟国“意见协调起来”以后，“对于任何有希望导致裁军和缓和局势的合理的建议，我们必须加以听取、讨论、而且如果可能还要加以协商。”但是，他同时又重申，美国仍然坚持它用来阻挠达成裁军协议的老建议。
