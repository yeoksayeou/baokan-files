Excellent Teaching Material for Socialist Education
    ——Introducing the "Workers' Class Socialist Education Learning Materials" Published in the "China Worker" Magazine
    Mo Fei
    During the rectification movement in enterprises, the broad masses of workers actively participated in the blooming and contending, helping enterprise leaders to overcome the three bad tendencies and greatly promoting the development of socialist construction. These actions show that the working class deserves to be the leading class. However, it should also be noted that some workers, especially many new workers, come from peasant, student, and urban poor backgrounds, and have relatively serious petit-bourgeois ideas. Some even come from exploiting classes, and have even more serious exploiting class consciousness and bad habits. Therefore, they urgently need to carry out self-ideological reform and raise their socialist consciousness.
    Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on carrying out rectification and socialist education movements in enterprises, various regions have conducted some education in conjunction with the specific problems of their enterprises and regions through extensive debates, and have achieved certain results. However, it is generally necessary to promote this education movement more deeply and systematically. The "Workers' Class Socialist Education Learning Materials" published in the first and second issues of "China Worker" this year provide excellent teaching materials for carrying out this education.
    The "Learning Materials" cover six issues in total. In addition to the five issues stipulated in the Central Committee's instructions, a sixth issue on unity is added. These six issues are raised based on the problems brought out by the workers and staff in various factories and mines through blooming and contending, and therefore basically summarize some of the more common problems existing in the minds of workers and staff.
    As the leading class, the working class should first of all clearly understand its own position and responsibilities. However, some people do not have a good understanding of this point, and therefore cannot play a greater role in socialist construction. In response to these problems, the "Learning Materials" provides a more thorough explanation.
    The fact that the working class is the leading class of the country itself shows that the personal interests of the working masses are fundamentally consistent with the interests of the country. Facts have also proven this point. Since the founding of New China, the lives of the working masses have improved significantly. However, it should also be noted that there are still contradictions between the personal interests of the working masses and the interests of the country. As a result, some people, due to a lack of correct understanding and attitude, one-sidedly emphasize personal interests and ignore collective interests, resulting in some losses to personal and national interests. The "Learning Materials" will help workers and staff correctly understand and treat this issue.
    From the relationship between life and production, we can also see the relationship between personal and national interests. In terms of the fundamental goal, developing production is to improve people's lives; but the improvement of life must be based on the development of production. Without the development of production, any improvement in life is impossible. However, some workers, especially many new workers, often make excessive demands on life, regardless of actual possibilities, which is obviously wrong. The "Learning Materials" also provides simple and vivid explanations of these principles.
    The working class has a high degree of organization and discipline. However, this does not mean that every worker has these characteristics, especially some new workers from peasant, urban poor, and student backgrounds, who have poorer organization and discipline. This is because they lack a deep understanding of the characteristics of the socialist enterprise management system – a combination of high concentration and high democracy – and lack a correct understanding of the nature of freedom and democracy, the relationship between democracy and centralism, and the relationship between freedom and discipline. The "Learning Materials" will help us clarify these issues.
    The worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of our country. Our country's first Five-Year Plan was completed on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance. However, this does not mean that there are no problems with the worker-peasant alliance. The reasons for the problems include historical influences, shortcomings in the implementation of labor wage and labor insurance welfare policies, and deviations in the ideological style of peasants and workers, etc. Therefore, in terms of the working masses, they first need to correct their understanding, establish the viewpoint of mutual support and sharing weal and woe with peasants in production and life, and actively strengthen close ties with peasants. This is what the "Learning Materials" focuses on elaborating.
    The working class is the most united, and will be even more united after the great debate. However, among a small number of workers, there are also some phenomena of insufficient unity, such as mutual disrespect and mutual discrimination. This is mainly due to ideological understanding problems. The "Learning Materials" analyzes and elaborates on these ideological understanding problems.
    As teaching material for socialist education for workers, this set of learning materials is more practical. It adopts the method of combining theory with practice, and clarifies several universal issues raised by workers in the great blooming, contending, and debate. By seriously studying this teaching material, many erroneous understandings encountered in the debate can be clarified. It should be noted here that this set of learning materials is of a general outline nature. Therefore, when applying it, it should also be linked to the actual situation of the enterprise, the industry, and the region, and used in the debate, in order to truly learn well.

    社会主义教育的良好教材
    ——介绍“中国工人”杂志发表的“工人阶级社会主义教育学习材料”
    莫非
    在企业的整风运动中，广大职工群众积极投入大鸣大放，帮助企业领导克服三个坏主义，大大地推进了社会主义建设的发展。这些行动表明，工人阶级作为领导阶级是当之无愧的。但是，也应该看到，有些工人，特别是有很多新工人，他们出身于农民、学生、城市贫民，有着比较严重的小资产阶级思想。有的甚至出身于剥削阶级，更有着严重的剥削阶级意识和坏习气。因此，他们急需进行自我思想改造，提高社会主义觉悟。
    自从中共中央发出关于在企业中进行整风和社会主义教育运动的指示以后，各地已经结合本企业、本地区的具体问题通过大辩论进行了一些教育，并且收到了一定的效果。但是，一般都还需要把这一教育运动更深入地更系统地推进。“中国工人”今年第一、二期发表的“工人阶级社会主义教育学习材料”，为进行这个教育提供了良好的教材。
    “学习材料”，共讲六个问题。除了中央指示中规定的五个问题，又加上一个团结问题。这六个问题是根据各厂矿职工大鸣大放出来的问题提出来的，因而基本上概括了在职工思想中比较普遍存在的一些问题。
    作为领导阶级的工人阶级，首先应该明确自己的地位和责任。但是，对这一点有些人还没有很好的认识，因而也就不能在社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用。针对这些问题，“学习材料”做了比较透彻的讲解。
    工人阶级是国家的领导阶级这一事实本身，就说明了工人群众的个人利益同国家利益根本上是一致的。事实也证明了这一点，新中国成立以来，工人群众的生活有了显著的改善。但是，也应该看到，工人群众的个人利益同国家利益也还存在着矛盾。于是，有些人由于缺乏正确的认识和态度，片面地强调个人利益，忽视集体利益，以致给个人利益和国家利益带来一些损失。“学习材料”将帮助职工正确地认识和对待这个问题。
    从生活同生产的关系中，也可以看到个人利益同国家利益的关系。就根本目的来说，发展生产就是为了改善人民生活；但是生活的改善必须建立在生产发展的基础上，没有生产的发展，生活的任何改善都是不可能的。但是，有些工人，尤其是很多新工人，往往不问实际可能，提出了过高的生活要求，这显然是不对的。关于这些道理，“学习材料”也做了通俗而生动的讲解。
    工人阶级是具有高度的组织性和纪律性的。但是，这并不是说每一个工人都已具备了这一特点，特别是一些出身于农民、城市贫民和学生的新工人，组织性、纪律性更差些。这是因为他们对社会主义企业管理制度的特点——高度的集中同高度的民主相结合——缺乏深刻的了解，对自由同民主的性质、对民主同集中的关系、对自由同纪律的关系，缺乏正确的认识。“学习材料”将帮助我们弄清这些问题。
    工农联盟是我们国家的基础。我国的第一个五年计划就是在工农联盟的基础上完成的。但是，这不等于说工农联盟就没有问题了。所以有问题的原因，有的是历史的影响，有的是执行劳动工资和劳保福利政策有缺点，有的是农民和工人的思想作风有偏差，等等。因此，在职工群众方面来说，他们首先需要端正认识，从思想上树立同农民在生产和生活上互相支援、同甘共苦的观点，主动地加强同农民的密切联系。这是“学习材料”所着重阐述的。
    工人阶级是最团结的，经过大辩论以后将更加团结。但是，在少数工人中间，也还存在着一些互不尊重、互相歧视的不够团结的现象。这主要是由于思想认识问题产生的。“学习材料”针对这些思想认识问题作了分析和阐述。
    作为向工人进行社会主义教育的教材，这套学习材料是比较实用的。它采取了理论联系实际的方法，讲清了工人在大鸣大放大辩论中提出的几个带普遍性的问题。认真地学习这一教材，可以澄清许多在辩论中碰到的错误认识。这里，应该注意的是，这套学习材料是提纲性质的东西，因此，在应用时还应该联系本企业、本产业和本地区的实际情况，并在辩论中加以运用，才能真正学好。
