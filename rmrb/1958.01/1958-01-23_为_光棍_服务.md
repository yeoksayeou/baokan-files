    Serving "Single Men"
    Soon, everyone will be going to the countryside, and they will definitely need to organize their belongings. At this time, single young men generally encounter a troublesome problem: what to do with those torn socks and clothes? Throw them away? It's a pity because they can still be worn after mending. If they don't throw them away, they have to carry them, but when will they have the ability to mend them themselves?
    Our single young men here have already solved this problem. Four girls, led by Song Wanru, posted a big-character poster saying, "We want to do something for the young men going to the countryside." The services include mending socks, sewing clothes, doing woolen work, and also making shorts and simple undershirts. They borrowed a sewing machine and gathered at Song Wanru's house after work, so it became a small "sewing shop."
    At first, there were not many customers who patronized the place. The girls seemed to have guessed the young men's thoughts: Are they embarrassed? So, they went to find them separately, and in this way, the "sewing shop's" work slowly increased.

    为“光棍”服务
    快下乡了，大家必定要整顿一下行装。这个时候，光棍小伙子一般会碰到这样一件伤脑筋的事：那些破了的袜子和衣服怎么办呢？扔掉吧，可惜，补一补还是可以穿的，不扔就得背着走，但是到何时自己才有本事把它们补起来呢？
    这个难题，我们这里的光棍小伙子已经解决了。以宋婉如为首的四位姑娘，张贴出了“要为下放的小伙子做些事”的大字报，服务内容有补袜子、缝衣服、绒线活，还裁做短裤和简便的汗背心等，她们借来了缝纫机，一下班就到宋婉如家里去集中，于是，这里就变成了一个小小的“缝纫店”。
    起初，肯光顾这里的主顾并不多，姑娘们像猜到小伙子的心事似的：怕难为情吗？于是，她们便分头去找，就这样，“缝纫店”的活计也慢慢地多了起来。
