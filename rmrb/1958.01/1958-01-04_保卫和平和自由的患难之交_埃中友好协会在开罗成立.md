Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 3rd: The Egypt-China Friendship Association was established here on January 2nd. The Egyptian Minister of Religious Endowments, Ahmed Hassan al-Baquri, serves as the chairman of the association, and the secretary-general is Omar Mari.

    The Egypt-China Friendship Association held a reception to celebrate its establishment. Egyptian Minister of Health, Dr. Talaat, attended the reception on behalf of President Nasser. Also attending the reception were Minister of Industry Sidqi, Minister of Commerce Nusseir, Minister of Transportation Khalil, Minister of Supply Stino, Minister of Public Works Sharabassi, as well as many prominent Egyptian social figures and well-known Egyptians who have visited China.

    The Chinese delegation to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, headed by Guo Moruo, the Chinese student delegation, as well as Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Chen Jiakang and embassy staff also attended the reception.

    In his speech at the reception, Baquri mentioned his visit to China after the Bandung Conference, saying that what he saw there was beyond his expectations. China's rejuvenation is reflected in all aspects of life. The Chinese people are engaged in various works to defend freedom and peace, and all their labor is carried out under a leadership welcomed by the people.

    He also said that when the three countries of Britain, France, and Israel invaded Egypt, the Chinese people stood by the Egyptian people. Their assistance was sincere and unpretentious.

    Baquri pointed out that the people of Egypt and China have much in common, and their interests are also consistent. Both countries have a long history, have been subjected to imperialist oppression, and have risen up against imperialism and achieved victory. Their relationship is extremely harmonious, and their friendship is built on the lofty ideals of freedom and peace. He believes that the establishment of the Egypt-China Friendship Association just after the conclusion of the historic Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is a happy coincidence.

    Bao Erhan, the deputy head of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference and the president of the China-Egypt Friendship Association, pointed out in his speech that since the Bandung Conference, the friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people has made great progress. He said, "The friendship between China and Egypt, which has been tested in the anti-colonialist struggle, is extremely deep-rooted and is a friendship forged in adversity. You can be assured that the Chinese people are the most reliable friends and brothers of the Egyptian people. The establishment of the Egypt-China Friendship Association today also demonstrates the Egyptian people's friendship towards the Chinese people. I believe that in their struggle against colonialism and to defend world peace, as well as in their own economic construction, this friendship will be strengthened and developed."

    Bao Erhan presented gifts to the Egypt-China Friendship Association on behalf of the China-Egypt Friendship Association and read out the congratulatory message from the China-Egypt Friendship Association at the meeting.

    保卫和平和自由的患难之交
    埃中友好协会在开罗成立
    新华社开罗3日电　埃中友好协会1月2日在这里成立。埃及宗教基金部长艾哈迈德·哈桑·巴库里担任这个协会的主席，秘书长为欧默尔·马里。
    埃中友好协会为庆祝它的成立举行了招待会。埃及卫生部长塔拉夫博士代表纳赛尔总统参加了招待会。参加待招会的还有工业部长西德基、商业部长努赛尔、交通部长哈利尔、供应部长斯提诺、公共工程部长沙拉巴西，以及许多埃及社会名流和曾经访问过中国的埃及知名人士。
    以郭沫若为首的参加亚非人民团结大会的中国代表团、中国学生代表团以及中国驻埃及大使陈家康和大使馆人员也参加了招待会。
    巴库里在招待会上致词时，提到了他在万隆会议以后在中国进行的访问，他说，他在那里所看到的，可以说是出乎意料之外的。中国的复兴反映在生活中的各个方面。中国人民正在从事各种工作，以保卫自由和和平，而他们的全部劳动都是在人民所欢迎的一种领导之下进行的。
    他还说，当英、法和以色列三国侵略埃及的时候，中国人民站在埃及人民一边。他们的援助是忠实的，是毫不加以吹嘘的。
    巴库里指出，埃中两国人民有许多共同之处，他们的利益也是一致的。两国都有悠久的历史，都受过帝国主义的压迫，都曾经奋起反对帝国主义而取得了胜利。他们的关系是极其融洽的，他们的友谊是建立在自由和和平的崇高的理想之上的。他认为，埃中友好协会恰好在具有历史意义的亚非人民团结大会刚刚闭幕的时候成立，这是一种令人高兴的巧合。
    参加亚非人民团结大会的中国代表团副团长、中埃友好协会会长包尔汉在会上讲话的时候指出，自从万隆会议以来，中埃人民的友谊已经获得了很大的进展。他说，“在反殖民主义斗争中经历了考验的中埃友谊是极其根深蒂固的，也是一种患难之交。你们可以确信，中国人民是埃及人民最可靠的朋友和兄弟。今天埃中友好协会的成立，也表明了埃及人民对中国人民的友谊。我相信，在他们反对殖民主义和保卫世界和平的斗争中以及在他们本国的经济建设中，这种友谊将得到加强和发展”。
    包尔汉在会上代表中埃友好协会向埃中友好协会赠送了礼物，并且宣读了中埃友好协会的贺电。
