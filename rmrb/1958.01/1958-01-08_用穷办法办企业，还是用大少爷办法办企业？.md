Running a Business with Frugal Methods or a "Young Master" Approach?
    Wang Pu
    Whether to run enterprises with frugal methods or with the approach of a "young master" once sparked debate among some people. According to a December 26, 1957, report in the *Guizhou Daily*, some people at the Guizhou Provincial Local Industry Conference held in December believed that using frugal methods to run enterprises was like "a bound-foot woman walking," arguing that "the 'young master' style is relative, and as long as financial resources permit, we should still look to the advanced" (which implies that using frugal methods to run enterprises is looking to the backward). Obviously, these comrades did not quite agree with using frugal methods to run enterprises.

    "A bound-foot woman walking," "looking to the backward," we have never approved of these. But the question is, is using frugal methods to run enterprises really "a bound-foot woman walking?" Is it really "looking to the backward?" We would like to express some opinions on this issue.

    We firmly advocate using frugal methods to run enterprises. The so-called "frugal methods" mean that when running factories, opening mines, and engaging in other construction projects, we must be like poor people living their lives, not seeking ostentation or extravagance, and carefully calculating every penny of expenditure. Under the condition of not hindering production development, we should use the old when possible instead of buying new, be simple when possible, and avoid spending money when possible. We should use one yuan as two yuan and one person as two people. In 1955, the Fuquan Power Plant in Anshun Prefecture, Guizhou Province, mobilized workers who had no work to do during the day to repair farm tools for farmers. Without a lathe, they repaired and used a discarded lathe. Without tools, they made their own tools using scrap iron. Without factory buildings, they borrowed the houses of the district committee. This is an example of running an enterprise with frugal methods. The railway transport team building the Baotou Iron and Steel Base had no houses to live in and no tools to use, so they borrowed other people's axes and chisels to build houses and make tools themselves, and started the train. This is another example of running a business with frugal methods. These are all the true colors of the working class under the leadership of our Party. If we all spend less money and accomplish more, or even accomplish good things without spending money, then we can use our existing financial, material, and human resources to build more factories and mines, and the speed of industrial development in our country will be faster. This is not only not "a bound-foot woman walking," but on the contrary, it is simply a long-legged athlete running a race! This is not looking to the backward, but precisely looking to the advanced.

    The "young master's" approach is different. The characteristic of a "young master" is that he believes his family has a large fortune, spends money lavishly, and does things that are flashy but not practical. Using the "young master's" method to run enterprises would be like Tianzhu County, Guizhou Province, building an oil pressing factory, traveling thousands of miles to Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places to buy large machines, and spending nearly two years without installing the machines properly. Even if they are installed in the future, they will not be able to fully utilize their production capacity because there is insufficient raw material. If everyone ran enterprises like this, our industry would truly be like "a bound-foot woman walking," tottering along, never able to advance by leaps and bounds.

    The Party has already pointed out the goal of struggle for the next fifteen years: to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other important industrial products, and to build our country into a strong Socialist country that has modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. In order to achieve this goal, what we need is the speed of development of a long-legged athlete running a race, not the speed of development of "a bound-foot woman walking." For this reason, we must use frugal methods to run all enterprises. For us Communists, the "young master" style is absolutely unacceptable. Not only when financial resources are insufficient, but even when financial resources are abundant, we must resolutely oppose the "young master" style, because this style will not only bring serious waste, but also ruin things.

    用穷办法办企业，还是用大少爷办法办企业？
    王朴
    用穷办法来办企业呢，还是用大少爷的办法来办企业？曾经在一些人中引起争论。据1957年12月26日贵州日报消息，在12月份举行的贵州省地方工业会议上，就有的人认为用穷办法办企业是“小脚女人走路”，认为“大少爷作风是相对的，只要财力许可，还是应该向先进看齐，”（这就意味着用穷办法办企业是向落后看齐）。显然，这些同志是不大同意用穷办法办企业的。
      “小脚女人走路”，“向落后看齐”，我们向来是不赞成的。但问题在于，用穷办法办企业是否就是“小脚女人走路？”是否就是“向落后看齐？”我们想就这个问题发表一点意见。
    我们是坚决主张用穷办法办企业的。所谓“穷办法”，就是在办工厂，开矿山，以及办其它建设事业的时候，都要像穷人过日子一样，不讲排场，不求阔绰，一文一毛的开支，都要精打细算。在不妨碍生产发展的条件下，可以用旧的就不必买新的，能简陋的就简陋点，可以不花钱的就不花钱。我们应该把一元钱当两元用，一个人当两个人用。1955年，贵州省安顺专区的福泉电厂，动员白天没活干的工人给农民修农具，没有车床，就把废车床修理起来用，没有工具，就自己动手用废铁制造，没有厂房，就借区委会的房子用，这是一个用穷办法办企业的例子。建设包头钢铁基地的铁路运输队，没有房子住，没有工具用，就借人家的斧子、凿子来自己动手盖房子，造工具，把火车开起来，这又是一个用穷办法办事业的例子。这些都是工人阶级在我们党的领导下，办事情的本色。如果我们都这样少花钱多办事，或者不用钱也能办好事，那末，我们就可以用现有的财力、物力和人力，兴办更多的工厂、矿山，我国的工业发展速度就会更快。这不仅不是“小脚女人走路”，而且相反，简直是长腿运动员在赛跑！这不是向落后看齐，而正是向先进看齐。
    大少爷的办法就不一样了。大少爷的特点是自持家大业大，花钱大手大脚，办事情华而不实。用大少爷的办法办企业，就会像贵州省天柱县建设榨油厂一样，千里迢迢跑到上海、天津等地买大机器，花了近二年时间还没把机器安装好，将来安装好了也不能充分发挥生产能力，因为原料不足。如果大家都这样办企业，我们的工业，倒会真正像“小脚女人走路”一样，摇摇摆摆的，永远不能大步前进。
    党已经向我们指出今后十五年的奋斗目标：要在钢铁和其它重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国，要把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。为了达到这个目标，我们需要的是长腿运动员赛跑的发展速度，而不是“小脚女人走路”的发展速度。为此，我们必须用穷办法来办一切企业。对于我们共产党人来说，“大少爷作风”是绝对要不得的。不仅是财力不足的时候，就是在财力富裕的时候，也要坚决反对“大少爷作风”，因为这种作风不仅会带来严重的浪费，而且还要把事情办坏。
