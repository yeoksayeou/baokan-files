    Publicly Funded Healthcare and Sending Down
    Ding Dong, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Finance Department
    Some people worry that cadres sent down to the countryside will not be able to enjoy the benefits of publicly funded healthcare. The reason is that there are no hospitals or clinics in the countryside, and in remote mountain areas, they may not even be able to buy headache pills or mercurochrome.
    Indeed, our rural areas have not yet universally established clinics, and many areas have not yet completely eliminated the threat of disease to farmers. Therefore, the National Agricultural Development Program stipulates that "starting from 1956, within twelve years, in all possible places, we will basically eliminate the most serious diseases that endanger the people... actively train medical and health personnel, including doctors of traditional Chinese medicine. Actively carry out regular patriotic health campaigns among the masses, and cultivate good habits of everyone paying attention to hygiene and every family loving cleanliness."
    Comrades who are afraid that it will be inconvenient to enjoy publicly funded healthcare after being sent down to the countryside seem to value their personal interests too much. We know that sent-down cadres should not only transform themselves through labor training, but also help farmers transform the countryside, including helping the vast number of farmers eliminate diseases and pay attention to hygiene. This is another task that sent-down cadres should shoulder in their spare time, and its content is to publicize and set an example.
    Let's take a longer view!

    公费医疗和下放
    内蒙古自治区财政厅　丁冬
    有人担忧干部下放到农村，就享受不到公费治疗的福利了，理由是乡下没有医院也没有诊疗所，偏远一点的山区恐怕连头痛片、红汞水都买不到。
    的确，我们的农村还没有普遍建立起诊疗所，很多地区的农民也还没有完全摆脱疾病的威胁，所以，全国农业发展纲要上规定“从1956年起，在十二年内，在一切可能的地方，基本上消灭危害人民最严重的疾病……积极培养医务卫生人员，包括中医在内。积极开展群众的经常性的爱国卫生运动，养成人人讲卫生，家家爱清洁的良好习惯。”
    害怕下放到农村享受公费医疗不方便的同志，似乎是太看重个人的利益了。我们知道，下放干部不仅要通过劳动锻炼改造自己，而且要帮助农民改造农村，包括帮助广大农民消灭疾病，讲求卫生。这是下放干部在劳动之余应该担负起来的另一个任务，其内容就是宣传和树立榜样。
    把眼光放远一点吧！
