Esteemed Crown Prince Muhammad al-Badr, distinguished guests, friends, comrades:

    Today, representatives from all walks of life in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, are holding a grand gathering here to welcome His Royal Highness Prince Saif al-Islam Muhammad al-Badr, Deputy Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Yemen, and all the distinguished guests accompanying him on his friendly visit to our country. We feel very honored. Now, on behalf of all the people of Beijing, I would like to extend a warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and all the distinguished guests, and thank you for bringing the profound friendship of the Yemeni people to the Chinese people. Here, I am also honored to request His Royal Highness the Crown Prince to convey the lofty respect and cordial greetings of the people of Beijing and all the Chinese people to the people of Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, and to all the Yemeni people.

    Yemen is a country with a long history, hardworking and brave people, and abundant resources. Therefore, people respectfully call it the "Arab Paradise". In order to oppose foreign aggression and oppression and strive for national freedom and independence, the Yemeni people have waged heroic struggles against foreign aggressors as early as the sixteenth century. These historical events have long aroused the sympathy and admiration of the Chinese people. Since gaining independence, under the leadership of Imam Ahmad and Crown Prince Muhammad al-Badr, Yemen has been engaged in a persistent anti-colonialist struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

    The history of friendly relations between the Chinese and Arab peoples in cultural and economic fields is very long! As early as the fifteenth century, the Chinese navigator Zheng He visited the coasts of Yemen when he was sent to the "Western Seas". Since then, a path of friendship has been opened between the Chinese and Yemeni people. It was only after the Western colonial powers invaded Asia and Africa that friendly exchanges between China and Yemen and the people of other Arab countries were hindered. However, the colonial powers could neither stop the progress of history, nor prevent China and Yemen from embarking on the road of independent development, nor could they hinder the restoration of their friendly relations on the road ahead. In 1955, both of our countries participated in the Bandung Conference and expressed our common language there: peace, independence, and friendly cooperation. In September 1956, we established diplomatic relations between our two countries. Since then, the friendly relations between China and Yemen have entered a new stage.

    The Chinese people have also suffered from imperialist aggression and oppression for a long time in the past. The Chinese and Yemeni people have common feelings and a common language. It is for this reason that the Chinese people express special concern and admiration for the current just struggle of the Yemeni people. The Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Arab people as their own struggle, and your victory as their own victory. We firmly support the just struggle of the Yemeni people to safeguard national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The struggle of the Yemeni people is very heroic. Although there will be many difficulties on the road ahead, the Chinese people firmly believe that the just struggle of the Yemeni people will surely be victorious.

    Respected Crown Prince, we sincerely welcome you and other distinguished guests from Yemen to visit Beijing and other parts of our country to understand our situation in various aspects, to see our good and progressive aspects, and also to see our shortcomings and backward aspects. We sincerely welcome you to give us guidance on our work.

    His Royal Highness Prince Muhammad al-Badr's visit to our country is a new page in the history of Sino-Yemeni relations. We believe that the traditional friendship between China and Yemen in the past will surely usher in new development from now on. We also firmly believe that your visit will make beneficial contributions to the cause of peace in Asia, Africa and the world.

    I wish the Yemeni people happiness and national prosperity!

    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Yemeni people!

    Long live the friendship between the people of Beijing and Sana'a!

    Long live peace in Asia, Africa and the world!

    中也传统友谊将从此得到新发展
    张友渔副市长在北京各界欢迎巴德尔王太子大会上的讲话
    敬爱的穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下，贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    今天我们中华人民共和国首都——北京的各界代表在这里举行盛大集会，欢迎也门王国副首相塞弗·伊斯兰·穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下和陪同他前来我国进行友好访问的全体贵宾们，我们感到非常荣幸。现在我谨代表北京市全体人民向王太子殿下和各位贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢，感谢你们给中国人民带来了也门人民的深厚友谊。在这里我也荣幸地请求王太子殿下把北京市人民和全中国人民的崇高的敬意和亲切的问候带给也门首都——萨那人民和全体也门人民。
    也门是一个历史悠久的国家，她有勤劳勇敢的人民和丰富的物产。所以人们都尊称她为“阿拉伯的乐园”。为了反对外国的侵略和压迫、争取国家的自由和独立，早在十六世纪，也门人民就向外国侵略者进行过英勇的斗争。这些历史事迹早已引起中国人民的同情和钦佩。也门获得独立以后，在伊马姆·艾哈迈德国王和穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子的领导下，又在为维护国家的主权和领土完整进行着坚持不懈的反殖民主义斗争。
    中国人民和阿拉伯人民在文化经济方面建立友好关系的历史已经很悠久了！早在十五世纪，中国航海家郑和奉使下“西洋”的时候，就曾经访问过也门一带的海岸。从那个时候起，中国人民和也门人民之间就已经开辟了友谊的道路。只是在西方殖民国家侵入亚非两洲以后，中国同也门和其他阿拉伯国家人民的友好来往才受到阻碍。但是，殖民国家既不能阻止历史向前发展，也不能挡住中国和也门走上独立发展的道路，更不能阻挠中、也两国在前进的道路上恢复它们的友好关系。1955年，我们两国都参加了万隆会议，并且在那里表达出了我们心中的共同语言：和平、独立、友好合作。1956年9月我们两国建立了外交关系。从此，中、也两国的友好关系就进入了一个新的阶段。
    中国人民过去也曾长期遭受过帝国主义的侵略和压迫。中国人民和也门人民之间有着共同的感情和共同的语言。正是因为这个道理，中国人民对也门人民当前的正义斗争表示特别的关怀和敬佩。中国人民一向把阿拉伯人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争，把你们的胜利看作是自己的胜利。我们坚决支持也门人民为维护国家的独立、主权和领土完整而进行的正义斗争。也门人民的斗争是十分英勇的。在前进的道路上虽然还会有许多困难，但是中国人民坚决相信，也门人民所进行的正义斗争是一定会得到胜利的。
    尊敬的王太子殿下，我们诚恳地欢迎您和其他来自也门的贵宾们在北京和我国各地参观，了解我们各方面的情况，看一看我们好的和进步的方面，也看一看我们的缺点和落后的方面。我们诚恳地欢迎你们对我们的工作给以指教。
    穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下对我国的访问，是中也两国关系史上新的一页。我们相信，中也两国间过去的传统友谊必将从此得到新的发展。我们也深信，你们的这次访问对亚非和全世界的和平事业会作出有益的贡献。
    祝也门人民幸福、国家繁荣！
    中也两国人民的友谊万岁！
    北京—萨那人民的友谊万岁！
    亚非和世界和平万岁！
