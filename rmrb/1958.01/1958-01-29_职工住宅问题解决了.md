The employee housing problem solved

Due to its recent establishment, the Lanzhou Locomotive Depot of the Ministry of Railways had a very tight housing situation, as a large number of train crew members were transferred from Qiqihar and Baichengzi in the Northeast, and Jinan and Hefei in East China. In addition, some employees brought family members from the countryside to the factory. Recently, after analyzing this situation, the depot's Party committee, on the one hand, called on the family members of employees originally in the countryside to return home to engage in production, and on the other hand, called on employees to raise funds themselves to build housing.

The vast majority of employees responded to the Party committee's call, and most of them sent their families back to their hometowns. Those who could not return home enthusiastically invested in building houses. Instructor driver Yin Lianrong originally planned to buy a sewing machine, but when he heard that houses were being built, he took out his savings of two hundred yuan. Before long, the depot built twenty-eight earthen houses, and with the single employees squeezing together, the housing problem of more than sixty employee households that needed to be solved was resolved.燕树桂

    职工住宅问题解决了
    铁道部兰州机务段由于成立不久，大批乘务人员从东北的齐齐哈尔、白城子，和华东的济南、合肥等地调来，加上有些职工从农村接家属来厂，职工宿舍非常紧张。最近，这个段的党委分析了这个情况后，一方面号召原在农村的职工家属回乡生产，另方面，号召职工自己集资兴建住宅。
    广大职工响应了党委的号召，大部分都把家属送还乡下；不能还乡的就踊跃投资筑房子。指导司机尹连荣本来准备买一部缝纫机，听说要修房子，就把积存的二百元拿出来了。没有多久，这个段便盖成了二十八间土房，加上单身职工挤出房子，必须解决的六十多户职工的住房问题解决了。燕树桂
