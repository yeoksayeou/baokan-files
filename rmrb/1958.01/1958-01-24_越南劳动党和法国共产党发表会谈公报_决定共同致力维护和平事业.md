The communiqué stated that the French Communist Party delegation was very pleased to see the great achievements made by the Vietnam Workers' Party in the arduous task of restoring and developing the Vietnamese economy. The communiqué went on to point out that the construction of a new life in Vietnam is currently facing obstacles because Vietnamese territory is still divided.

The communiqué said that today, the people of all countries have enough power to stop the imperialists' plot to push humanity into a new war. The communiqué said that the Soviet Union plays a decisive role in the struggle to defeat the imperialist conspiracy.

The communiqué stated that the two parties will do their utmost to demand: 1. Universal, gradual and supervised disarmament, first and foremost the immediate cessation of atomic and nuclear weapons testing, and a strict ban on the production and use of atomic and hydrogen bombs; 2. Cessation of the policy of establishing blocs and military bases abroad, and a ban on the establishment of missile launch sites and the storage of atomic bombs; 3. Convening of the summit meeting of heads of government proposed by the Soviet Union.

The communiqué stated that the two delegations firmly believe that the people of the world are capable of forcing governments to practice peaceful coexistence; and firmly believe that in the peaceful competition between the two systems, socialism will increasingly demonstrate its superiority.
