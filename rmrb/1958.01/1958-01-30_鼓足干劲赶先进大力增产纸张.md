    Reported by our newspaper: A nationwide upsurge in paper industry production is taking shape. With the revolutionary drive of vigorous dragons and tigers, workers are breaking through old quotas, increasing the production of more high-quality and low-priced paper and pulp for the country, based on the principle of spending little or no money. The Jiamusi Pulp and Paper Mill, which has just been put into production, has rapidly increased the potential of its new equipment under the impetus of the upsurge, increasing its production capacity from 50% in December of last year to 75%. In January of this year, the daily output has exceeded one hundred tons (the daily output in December last year was seventy to eighty tons of paper). This factory is preparing to increase production by 417,000 tons this year. The Baichengzi Paper Mill in Jilin Province has already drawn up a leaping plan: to leap from the actual 6,000 tons of paper produced last year to more than 10,000 tons. The Guangzhou Paper Mill, one of the largest newsprint mills in the country, will increase the production of newsprint by 2,000 to 3,000 tons in the first quarter of this year.

    The general development trend of the upsurge in paper industry production is healthy and rapid. The potential of the paper industry is still very large. Under the same conditions of variety, production method, and basically the same raw materials and production equipment, there is a big difference between advanced and backward factories in terms of pulping, papermaking, pulp loss rate, and the monthly operating time of papermaking machines. According to rough calculations: if the paper's finished product rate is increased by 1%, the country can increase paper production by 10,000 tons annually; if it can be increased to the current advanced level, paper production can be increased by 50,000 tons. If the pulp loss is reduced by 1%, 10,000 tons of pulp can be saved. If it is reduced to 2%, 60,000 tons of pulp can be saved, which can greatly increase paper production. If each paper machine in the country increases its operating time by one hour per month, paper production can be increased by 1,500 tons.

    It is very obvious that the potential for increasing production and practicing economy in the paper industry is huge, and there are many avenues. Currently, all the employees in this industry are going all out, preparing to draw up a leaping plan, and on this basis, to make the advanced even more advanced, and the backward and intermediate ones to actively catch up with the advanced.

### 鼓足干劲赶先进大力增产纸张

    鼓足干劲赶先进大力增产纸张
    本报讯　全国造纸工业的生产高潮正在形成。职工群众以生龙活虎般的革命干劲突破旧定额，在不花钱或少花钱的原则之下，为国家增产更多物美价廉的纸张和纸浆。刚刚投入生产的佳木斯制浆造纸厂，在高潮的推动之下，新设备的潜力迅速提高，生产能力由去年12月的50％，提高到75％，今年1月，日产量已突破一百吨（去年12月日产七十至八十吨纸），这个厂全年准备增产四十一万七千吨。吉林省白城子造纸厂，已经订出一个跃进的计划：纸张产量由去年实际达到的六千吨跃进到一万多吨。全国最大的新闻纸厂之一的广州造纸厂，今年第一季就要增产二、三千吨新闻纸。
    造纸工业生产高潮总的发展趋势是健康的、迅速的。造纸工业潜力还很大。在品种相同，生产方法相同，原料和生产设备也基本相同的条件下，在制浆、造纸、纸浆流失率、造纸机每月作业时间方面，先进厂与落后厂之间相差很大。根据粗略计算：如果纸的成品率提高1％，则全国全年即可增产纸张一万吨；如果能提高到现在的先进水平，就可以增产纸张五万吨。如果纸浆流失降低1％，即可节约纸浆一万吨，如果降低到2％的水平，则可节约纸浆六万吨，就可以大大地增产纸张。全国纸机每台每月增加作业时间一小时，就可增产纸张一千五百吨。
    十分明显，造纸工业增产节约的潜力是巨大的，门路是多方面的。目前这个行业的全体职工正在鼓足干劲，准备订出一个跃进计划，并在这个基础上，使先进的更先进，落后和中间的要积极赶上先进。
