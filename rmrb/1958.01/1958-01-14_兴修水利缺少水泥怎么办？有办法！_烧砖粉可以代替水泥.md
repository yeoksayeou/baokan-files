What to Do When Water Conservancy Construction Lacks Cement? There's a Solution!
Brick Powder Can Replace Cement

(According to a report from the Guangxi Daily): Nankang Township, Heng County, uses brick powder to replace cement in water conservancy construction, and the quality is good. This is a good way to solve the problem of cement shortage.

As early as the autumn of 1956, Nankang Township, Heng County, used brick powder instead of cement to repair the inclined pipes and horizontal pipes of four water conservancy projects; these projects withstood the test of floods. In the winter of 1957, in order to solve the difficulty of cement shortage, this township used brick powder to replace cement in the construction of water conservancy projects.

The experience of Nankang Township in manufacturing and using brick powder is: (1) To ensure the quality of the bricks, attention must first be paid to the selection of soil. The soil for making brick blanks should be pure clay without sand, so that the brick blanks will not easily crack. (2) During firing, special attention should be paid to the heat; the fire should not be too large or too long; if it is overfired, it will be difficult to roll into powder, and if the fire is too small, it will not be fully fired and will not be able to withstand the scouring of water. The quality of the fired bricks can be identified in this way: the feet of overfired bricks are black, and the bricks with good fire color are grayish-white. The quality of the fired bricks coming out of the kiln is generally poor at the top, bottom, left, and right, so the middle part should be selected for use. (3) Fired bricks must not be damp when taken out, as they will lose their effectiveness after being damp. Therefore, the fired bricks taken out of the kiln should be one meter away from the ground and propped up with wooden boards. The brick should be powdered immediately after it is taken out of the kiln, otherwise it will easily become damp after a long time, and rain should be avoided. (4) The method of powdering is: first use an iron hammer to crush the fired brick (this work should be carried out on the threshing floor of the rammed earth, not on the mud floor, so as to avoid dampness); the crushed fired brick is placed in a mortar and pestle and pounded into powder, and then sieved with a sieve to remove sand particles and make it into a flour-like brick powder. (5) The method of use is to mix it with river sand and lime. Good river sand and lime should be selected. The ratio is generally ten catties of brick powder, ten catties of river sand, and three catties of lime. In some projects, the amount used is one part lime, one part brick powder, and one part river sand; this can solidify faster.

    兴修水利缺少水泥怎么办？有办法！
    烧砖粉可以代替水泥
    本报讯　据广西日报报道：横县南康乡用烧砖粉代替水泥修水利，质量良好。这是解决水泥不足问题的好办法。
    横县南康乡在1956年秋天，就以烧砖粉代替水泥修补了四处水利工程的斜管和卧管；这些工程经受住了洪水的考验。1957年冬天，这个乡为解决水泥不足的困难，又用烧砖粉来代替水泥兴修水利工程。
    南康乡制造和使用烧砖粉的经验是：（一）要烧砖的质量好，首先要注意选土。做烧砖坯样的土质，要不带沙的纯粘土，这样砖坯就不易崩裂。（二）在烧制的时候，要特别注意火候，用火不能太大、太久；烧过火了就难轧成粉末，火小了烧不熟就经不起水的冲刷。可以这样鉴别烧砖的质量：烧过火的砖脚发黑色，火色好的砖发灰白色。出窑的火砖，上下左右的质量一般较差，因此要选中间的使用。（三）火砖取出的时候切忌潮湿，受潮后就会失去效能。因此，出窑的烧砖要离地面一公尺，用木板架起来。烧砖出窑后要马上制粉，否则时间太久容易回潮，还要避免雨水淋湿。（四）制粉的方法是：先用铁锤把烧砖捶碎（这项工作应在三合土的晒谷场上进行，不能在泥坪上进行，以免受潮）；捶碎了的烧砖放到椎舂舂成粉末，再用箩斗筛过，除去沙粒，做成面状的砖粉。（五）使用办法是同河沙、石灰混合。河沙、石灰要选择好的。配的比例，一般的是砖粉十斤，河沙十斤，石灰三斤。在有的工程上用的配量是一份石灰，一份砖粉，一份河沙；这样可以更快地凝固。
