(Reported by our Shanghai correspondent, January 10th) The Second Session of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China, Shanghai Municipal Committee, victoriously concluded here today. The conference was filled from beginning to end with revolutionary optimism and overflowed with the revolutionary vigor to accelerate the construction of a new socialist Shanghai.

At this conference, based on Comrade Zhou Enlai's speech on "The World Situation and the Rectification Task" and the report by Comrade Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee (Editor's Note: Comrade Ke Qingshi's report will be published in full in this newspaper), there was a broad discussion of the domestic and international situation, with a particular emphasis on discussing the main contradictions within the country.

One of the most important achievements of this conference was a comprehensive review of the Party's work in Shanghai over the past year, affirming the great achievements of Shanghai's work and criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking that lacked socialist drive in the face of the new situation.

Shanghai has made tremendous achievements on all fronts in the past year. This year, Shanghai's total industrial output value exceeded the target of the first Five-Year Plan by 16.3%, an increase of 297.51% compared to the early days of liberation in 1949, and a growth of 96% compared to 1952, the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan. On the cultural and educational front, especially on the political and ideological front, the mass rectification movement has achieved brilliant victories. However, in the past, some comrades within the Shanghai Party organization showed quite serious right-leaning conservative thinking in the face of the new situation. They nitpicked, saying that too much was being done here and that things were moving too fast there, and that the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's industrial policy of "full utilization and rational development" was also wrong. They called the normal revolutionary speed of Shanghai's various tasks "reckless advance" and described the Shanghai Party's active and enterprising spirit in its work as "being fond of the great and eager for quick success." This right-leaning conservative thinking caused some losses in the work last year.

At this conference, a profound criticism was made of this right-leaning conservative thinking. It was pointed out that those who shouted "reckless advance" actually lacked the revolutionary vigor of socialism and had a wrong understanding of what is normal and what is reckless advance. The conference pointed out that to engage in socialist revolution, to engage in socialist construction, to engage in this cause of competing with imperialism for time and speed, one must have a revolutionary drive. We must adopt a positive attitude towards all factors in Shanghai that are beneficial to socialism, and strive to turn negative factors into positive factors. According to the state's overall planning, we must do everything possible to offer ideas and find solutions to fully utilize the Shanghai base to serve socialism. Therefore, it should be seen that whatever can be achieved through effort should be achieved through effort, and this is the normal phenomenon; not striving to achieve it is the abnormal phenomenon. Otherwise, there is no talk of revolutionary attitude, revolutionary spirit, and revolutionary speed.

In the ideological struggle, special emphasis was placed on discussing the issue of revolutionary will, and the phenomenon of "moldy" thinking among some cadres was criticized. Generally speaking, the Shanghai Party organization's revolutionary will is vigorous, and this vigorous revolutionary will left a deep impression at this conference. However, in recent years, the revolutionary will of some comrades has declined, and "mold spots" have appeared in their thinking. In his report to the conference, Comrade Ke Qingshi analyzed Shanghai's Party members and cadres into three types: first, those with vigorous revolutionary will; second, those who are capable of not doing bad things, nor are willing to do them, but lack the spirit of striving for strength and tenacious progress; and third, those with heavier baggage of individualism and whose thinking has begun to mold. The first and second types accounted for the majority of Party members, while the third type accounted for only a minority of cadres, though their number was not insignificant.

The discussion on revolutionary will aroused a profound response among the delegates, with many saying that it was "a lesson they would never forget." This discussion adopted the method of laying out the problems thoroughly and earnestly helping each other to clean up the "mold spots" in their thinking. In this discussion, all the delegates attending the conference, without exception, conducted self-examinations and reflections. Many leading cadres frankly broke through considerations of face and revealed long-standing unresolved problems, spoke their hearts, and untied these "knots." Everyone was in a happy mood and high spirits. Some people with more "mold spots" in their thinking were also awakened and determined to correct their shortcomings and boost their spirits.

Another aspect of the ideological struggle at this conference was the criticism of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism that are divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, especially the criticism of the "official airs" among some cadres. This "official air" is mainly manifested in special privileges in life; not approaching the masses and having a bad attitude towards the masses; insufficient democratic style in work; and being careless and dragging things out in handling affairs. At the conference, everyone examined and analyzed the problem of "official air." Everyone said that our Party is not afraid of imperialism, not afraid of domestic reactionary forces, and not afraid of the difficulties and hardships in fighting nature, but is afraid of being divorced from the masses. As long as we are forever closely united with the people, there will be no invincible enemy. While examining themselves, everyone actively corrected their shortcomings during breaks in the conference. Many leading cadres returned to their units to conduct self-criticism in public to the masses, corrected the special privileges style, eliminated "official air" with practical actions, and integrated with the masses.

To eliminate bureaucratic styles, overcome the three major isms, and earnestly correct the phenomena of being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, the first step is to make a determination, and the second step is to have a correct set of rectification methods. Therefore, the conference studied issues such as improving the system, streamlining institutions, delegating cadres, strengthening weak links at the grassroots level, and improving the Party's grassroots organizations, and adopted some specific plans. These issues were long-standing problems that could not be resolved in the past, but the conference found a way to solve them. The conference also discussed the issues of building the country diligently and thriftily, managing households diligently and thriftily, practicing strict economy, and opposing waste, believing that this spirit must be promoted to every factory, enterprise, cooperative, government office, school, and every household to cultivate a new social atmosphere. The conference severely criticized the phenomena of extravagance and waste in all aspects.

On the basis of unifying thinking and boosting revolutionary vigor, this conference presented the Shanghai Party and all the people with inspiring goals. In the industrial field, it is required that the total output value at the end of the second Five-Year Plan will be more than doubled compared to the end of last year, making Shanghai a modern industrial base for chemical industry, precision machinery, instruments, telecommunications equipment, small steel, shipbuilding, light textile industry advanced products, etc. It is required that the quality of several major products with lower quality should catch up with or exceed the quality level of similar products in Britain or the United States within ten to fifteen years. In order to realize the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule, Shanghai should, under the overall arrangement of the central government, produce cheap and good-quality agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, water conservancy equipment, etc. to support the country's agricultural production. It is required that the suburbs of Shanghai basically achieve the various tasks stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program during the second Five-Year Plan, with an average grain yield per mu reaching 1,500 to 2,000 jin. It is required to launch a patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, and strive to make Shanghai basically a city free of mosquitoes, flies, rats, sparrows, bedbugs, cockroaches, and snails within three years. The conference called for the complete completion of the socialist transformation of capitalist ownership, and the strengthening of the transformation of bourgeois elements based on enterprises. It is required to strengthen the transformation of intellectuals, and strive to ensure that the left-wing and middle-left elements of senior intellectuals account for more than 60% within five years, and strive to create a huge contingent of working-class intellectuals within ten years. The proportion of workers and peasants in universities should reach more than 70%, and illiteracy among young and middle-aged people should be eliminated within five years. It is required to widely launch academic research activities, and strive to cultivate a group of technically proficient and politically reliable technical cadres, scientists, writers, artists, editors, journalists, professors, teachers, and Marxist theorists within ten years. Strive to train 300 social science workers with practical struggle experience and at the level of university lecturers or above within five years. The conference proposed: establishing satellite towns around Shanghai to disperse some small enterprises, and encouraging young people and those seeking employment to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor, and advocating family planning, striving to limit Shanghai's population to around 7 million, making Shanghai a healthier and more modern city.

These great goals have inspired all the delegates attending the conference, inspired the entire Party, and at the same time have aroused huge repercussions among the people of Shanghai. In the group and conference speeches, the representatives have made guarantees, determined to complete the tasks they are responsible for in advance with the greatest efforts and with the revolutionary spirit of the promotion faction. Under the leadership of Communist Party members, a new upsurge of rectification, an upsurge of going to the mountains and going to the countryside, an upsurge of industrial and agricultural production, an upsurge of culture and art, and an upsurge of eliminating the four pests have begun in the city, and a vigorous revolutionary vitality is promoting the entire Shanghai to leap forward.

    上海党代会展开深刻的思想斗争
    肃清暮气　打掉官风
    以促进派的革命气概实现全面大跃进
    本报上海10日电　中共上海市第一届代表大会第二次会议，今天在此间胜利闭幕。大会自始至终充满着革命的乐观主义，洋溢着加速建设社会主义新上海的革命干劲。
    这次会议上，曾根据周恩来同志在会上所作的关于“世界形势和整风任务”的讲话，和市委第一书记柯庆施同志的报告（编者按：柯庆施同志的报告将在本报全文发表），广泛地讨论了国内外形势，特别着重地讨论了国内的主要矛盾问题。
    这次会议的最重要收获之一，是对上海一年来党的工作进行了全面的检查，肯定了上海工作的巨大成就，批判了在新形势面前缺乏社会主义干劲的右倾保守思想。
    上海一年多来在各个战线上都取得了巨大的成绩。今年上海的工业总产值超过第一个五年计划指标的16.3％，比解放初期的1949年增加297.51％，比第一个五年计划开始的1952年增长了96％。在文教战线上，特别是政治思想战线上，经过全民整风运动，更获得了辉煌的胜利。但是在过去一段时期中，上海党内曾有一部分同志在新的形势面前表现了相当严重的右倾保守思想，他们指指点点地说这也办多了，那也办快了，上海市委提出的“充分利用、合理发展”的工业方针也错了，他们把上海各项工作正常的革命速度叫做“冒进”，把上海党在工作中的积极进取精神说成是“好大喜功”，这种右倾保守思想在去年曾一度使工作受到了一些损失。
    这次会上，对这种右倾保守思想作了深刻的批判，大家指出，那些高喊“冒进”的同志，实际上是他们缺乏社会主义的革命干劲，对于什么叫正常，什么叫冒进，作了错误的理解。会议指出：干社会主义革命，干社会主义建设，干这种同帝国主义争时间、比速度的事业，必须有一股革命的干劲。必须对上海的各种有利于社会主义的因素采取积极的态度，并且争取把消极因素变为积极因素，根据国家的统筹安排，千方百计地出主意、想办法，充分地利用上海基地为社会主义服务。因此，应当这样看，凡是经过努力可以做到的事情，就努力做到，这才是正常现象；不去努力做到，这才是不正常现象。否则，就谈不到革命态度、革命气概和革命速度。
    在思想斗争中，特别着重讨论了革命意志的问题，批判了一部分干部思想上“发霉”的现象。上海党组织整个说来革命意志是旺盛的，这种旺盛的革命意志在这次会上给人以深刻的印象。但是，近年来也有一部分同志，他们的革命意志衰退了，思想上发生了“霉点”。柯庆施同志在会上所作的报告中，曾把上海党员干部分析为三种类型：第一是革命意志旺盛的人。第二是能够不作，也不愿作坏事，但是缺乏发愤图强、顽强进取精神的人。第三是个人主义包袱较重，思想上开始发霉的人。第一、二两种人在党员中占大多数，第三种人虽有一定的数量，但在干部中只占少数。
    关于革命意志的讨论，在代表中引起了深刻的反应，许多人说成这是自己“永远难忘的一课”。这个讨论是采取一方面严正地彻底摊开问题，一方面诚恳地互相帮助的办法，把思想上的“霉点”洗刷个干净。这次讨论中，所有出席会议的代表，都无例外的作了检查反省，许多领导干部面对面地破除情面，揭开了过去长期悬而未决的问题，说出了心里话，解开了这些“结子”，大家心情愉快，精神振作。一些思想上“霉点”较多的人，也都有所惊醒，决心要改正缺点，鼓起劲来。
    这次会议上思想斗争中的另一内容，是批判了脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义，特别是批判了一部分干部中的“官气”。这种“官气”，主要表现在生活上的特殊化；不接近群众，对群众态度不好；在工作中民主作风不够；办事马虎拖拉等几个方面。会上，大家对“官气”问题作了检查和分析，大家说，我们的党一不怕帝国主义，二不怕国内反动势力，三不怕向自然界作战中的艰难困苦，就是怕脱离群众。只要我们永远和人民紧密地团结在一起，就没有不可战胜的敌人。大家一边检查，一边利用会议间隙积极改正，不少领导干部回到本单位向群众当众进行检讨，纠正特殊化作风，以实际行动肃清“官气”，与群众打成一片。
    要肃清官风，克服三大主义，认真改正脱离群众、脱离实际的现象，首先在于下决心，其次还在于有一套正确的整改办法，因此大会研究了改进体制、紧缩机构、下放干部、加强基层薄弱环节、改进党的基层组织等等问题，并通过了一些具体方案。这些问题都是过去长期不能解决的问题，这次会上找出了解决的途径。大会对勤俭建国、勤俭持家、厉行节约、反对浪费问题，也作了讨论，认为必须将这个精神推广到每个工厂、企业、合作社、机关、学校和每家每户，养成新的社会风气。大会对各方面的铺张浪费现象，作了严厉的指责。
    在统一了思想，鼓起了革命干劲的基础上，这次大会向上海全党全体人民提出了各项振奋人心的奋斗目标。在工业方面，要求在第二个五年计划期末，总产值比去年底增长一倍以上，使上海成为化学工业、精密机械、仪表、电讯器材、小型钢材、船舶修造、轻纺工业高级产品等现代的工业基地，要求若干质量较低的主要产品分别在十年到十五年期内赶上或超过英国或美国同类产品的质量水平。为了提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），上海应在中央统筹安排下，生产价廉物美的农具，化学肥料，水利设备等以支援全国的农业生产。要求上海郊区在第二个五年计划期间，基本上实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的各项任务，粮食每亩平均产量达到一千五百斤到两千斤。要求展开以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，争取三年内上海基本上成为无蚊、无蝇、无鼠、无雀、无臭虫、无蟑螂、无钉螺的七无城市。大会要求彻底完成对资本主义所有制的社会主义改造工作，加强以企业为基地的对资产阶级分子的改造工作。要求加强对知识分子的改造，争取在五年内，高级知识分子的左派和中左分子能占60％以上，争取在十年内造成一支宏大的工人阶级知识分子队伍，大学生中工农成份要达到70％以上，五年内扫除青壮年文盲；要求广泛展开学术研究活动，争取十年内培养出一批又红又专的技术干部、科学家、文学家、艺术家、编辑、记者、教授、教员和马克思主义理论家，争取在五年内培养出三百个有实际斗争经验的、有大学讲师以上水平的社会科学工作者。大会提出：在上海周围建立卫星城镇，分散一部分小型企业，并鼓励青年和要求就业的人到农村参加农业劳动，提倡计划生育，争取将上海人口限制在七百万人左右，使上海成为一个更加健康的现代化的城市。
    这些伟大的奋斗目标，振奋了所有与会的代表，振奋了全党，同时已在上海人民中引起了巨大的反响，在小组和大会的发言中代表们纷纷提出保证，决心以最大限度的努力，以促进派的革命气概，提前完成自己所担负的任务。在共产党员带头冲击下，现在全市已开始出现新的整改高潮，出现上山下乡的高潮，出现工农业生产的高潮，出现文化艺术的高潮，出现除四害的高潮，一种蓬蓬勃勃的革命朝气正推动整个上海在向前跃进。
