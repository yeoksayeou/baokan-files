Xinhua News Agency report: China's health undertakings have made considerable progress during the first Five-Year Plan period; the people's health and medical conditions have also improved significantly.

    The health work of socialist countries not only emphasizes treating illnesses for the broad masses of working people, but also emphasizes actively preventing diseases. In the past five years, China has carried out large-scale prevention and treatment work for diseases that are most harmful and widely prevalent among the working people, and has achieved considerable success. Several important virulent infectious diseases have been basically brought under control. Cholera has had a history of epidemic in China for decades. Before liberation, there were many major epidemics, killing thousands upon thousands of people in entire villages and streets. Some "scholars" believed that cholera could not be controlled in China and that a major epidemic would "inevitably" occur every three or four years. However, since liberation, due to the preventive measures taken by the People's Government, cholera has not occurred. Smallpox, an infectious disease, occurred almost every year in all provinces before liberation. In the past few years since liberation, due to the implementation of universal vaccination measures, smallpox is now nearly extinct in the country except for occasional cases in a few border areas. In terms of plague prevention and control, human plague has now been controlled. The plague areas in the original provinces and autonomous regions such as Inner Mongolia and Zhejiang are now free of patients. In addition, the incidence of other infectious diseases has also decreased significantly in the past five years. For example, the incidence of epidemic typhus in 1956 decreased by 89% compared with 1951, and relapsing fever decreased by 91%. Schistosomiasis has been prevalent in China for more than 60 years. During the reactionary rule era, it was simply left to harm the working people, especially farmers, for a long time. After liberation, the Party and the government immediately began to pay attention to prevention and treatment. At present, 309 cities and counties have fully launched prevention and treatment work; 19 specialized prevention and treatment centers, 236 prevention and treatment stations, and 1,346 prevention and treatment teams have been established. From liberation to the first quarter of 1957, 760,000 schistosomiasis patients have been treated nationwide. Malaria also has a long history of prevalence in China. Past dynasties and the Kuomintang also left it alone and never carried out any prevention or treatment. Now we have established 49 specialized prevention and treatment centers (stations) and 72 specialized prevention and treatment teams in the epidemic provinces. The state produces dozens of tons of antimalarial drugs every year, plus other traditional Chinese medicine antimalarial drugs, a large number of patients receive treatment and prevention every year. Although there were major floods across the country in 1956, the number of cases still decreased by 70% compared to 1955. Kala-azar is prevalent in the vast areas north of the Yangtze River in China. After liberation, a survey showed that there were about 600,000 patients across the country. In the past five years, the People's Government has established 24 specialized prevention and treatment institutions, and trained more than 10,000 grassroots prevention and treatment personnel. From liberation to 1956, more than 600,000 patients have been treated nationwide. In the future, with the addition of various active preventive measures, it is expected that kala-azar can be eliminated in the near future. In the past five years, significant achievements have also been made in preventing neonatal tetanus and puerperal fever in postpartum women. At present, China's infant mortality rate has dropped from 200 per thousand before liberation to 70.3 per thousand. In some large cities such as Beijing and Nanjing, there are almost no deaths from puerperal fever in postpartum women.
    Health and epidemic prevention stations, which mainly focus on preventing diseases and carrying out environmental sanitation, did not exist before liberation. According to statistics at the end of June 1957, more than 1,330 had been established nationwide, an increase of more than eight times compared with 1952. There are more than 3,800 public maternal and child health centers (stations), an increase of 1.9 times compared with 1952; an increase of 427 times compared with before liberation. There are 617 specialized disease prevention and treatment centers (stations), an increase of more than two times compared with 1952, and an increase of more than 87 times compared with before liberation.
    The combination of health work and mass movements is another characteristic of socialist health undertakings. The patriotic health movement, which plays a role in changing customs and habits, is an outstanding example of the combination of health work and mass movements. The largest work in the patriotic health movement is environmental sanitation and the elimination of the "four pests" (rats, flies, mosquitoes, and sparrows – later changed to bed bugs). Many residents have persisted in cleaning, eliminating mosquitoes and flies, and other sanitary work systems for years, and they have become accustomed to paying attention to hygiene.
    The people's medical conditions have been significantly improved. By the end of June 1957, there were more than 4,800 hospitals and sanatoriums nationwide, and the number of hospital beds and sanatorium beds had increased to more than 339,000, an increase of more than one time compared with 1952, and an increase of more than four times compared with the highest number of beds in 1947 before liberation. The number of health clinics, outpatient clinics, and health clinics (stations) in factories, mines, and enterprises established with state investment had increased to more than 23,400 by June 1957, an increase of more than 0.7 times compared with 1952, and an increase of 52.7 times compared with before liberation.
    In recent years, the level of medical technology has also been improved. Relatively complex operations can generally be performed and general difficult and complicated diseases can be resolved in county and district hospitals. In particular, since the cooperation between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine and the development of traditional Chinese medicine technology, the treatment effect of certain diseases has been significantly improved, and the cure rate of hospitals across the country has also increased accordingly. The speed of cure can be explained by the turnover of beds. In 1954, hospitals across the country admitted an average of 19.1 patients per bed per year, and in 1956 it had increased to 22.5 patients per bed per year.
    The medical and preventive organizations of New China have changed the state of serving only the bourgeoisie and landlord class in the old China era, and are oriented towards the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In addition to the People's Liberation Army having its own health organization system, a large number of medical institutions have been established in industrial areas and factories and mines; 272 epidemic prevention stations have been established in key industrial provinces and cities, and a large number of medical and epidemic prevention personnel have been equipped. The unhealthy conditions of factories and mines and the lack of protection for workers' health left over from the old society have been greatly changed. The development of medical and preventive institutions in rural areas has also reached an unprecedented scale.
    The growth of the health work force has also been rapid in recent years. In 1950, there were 42,000 Western doctors and pharmacists nationwide, and in 1956 it increased to more than 75,000. In these five years, the number of intermediate and primary health personnel nationwide has increased by one and a half times, and there are still about 500,000 traditional Chinese medicine personnel who have not been included in the statistics. In order to further expand the health work force and improve their level, the Party and the government attach great importance to medical education. At present, there are 38 higher medical colleges and universities nationwide; there are 176 secondary medical and health schools.
    In terms of medical science research, there was only one "Central Health Experimental Institute" in old China. Now, in addition to the center of medical science research—the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College; the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Institute of Parasitic Diseases, the Institute of Epidemiology, the Institute of Skin and Venereal Diseases, the Institute of Tuberculosis, the Institute of Occupational Health, the Institute of Biological Products, and the Hainan Malaria Research Station and 34 other research institutions have been established.
    There have also been great changes in the supply of medicinal materials during the first Five-Year Plan period. Before 1953, 70% to 80% of the medicines and equipment needed in China relied on imports from abroad, while now 80% of the medicinal materials needed nationwide can be produced domestically.
    In the past five years, due to the continuous improvement of medical conditions, the mortality rate of many diseases in China has decreased significantly. For example, the measles mortality rate in 1951 was 5.5%, and in 1956 it had dropped to 1.6%. The scarlet fever mortality rate dropped from 8.5% to 1.1%. The dysentery mortality rate dropped from 1.1% to 0.45%. The relapsing fever mortality rate dropped from 11.1% to 1.9%.

    五年来我国卫生事业大发展
    人民卫生状况和医疗条件有显著改进
    据新华社讯　中国卫生事业在第一个五年计划期间有了长足的发展；人民的卫生状况和医疗条件也有显著改善。
    社会主义国家的卫生工作不但重视为广大劳动人民治病，更重视积极预防疾病。五年来，我国对危害劳动人民最大、流行最广的疾病进行了规模巨大的防治工作，已经取得了不小的成绩。几种重要的烈性传染病，基本上得到了控制。霍乱病在中国已有几十年的流行历史，解放前曾经有多次大流行，整村、整街地死亡了千千万万人。有些“学者”认为霍乱在中国无法控制，每隔三、四年就“必然”要一次大流行。可是解放以来，由于人民政府采取了预防措施，霍乱从未发生。天花这种传染病在解放前全国各省几乎每年都发生，解放几年来由于进行了普种牛痘的措施，现在全国除少数边疆地区个别发生外，天花已近绝迹。鼠疫防治方面，现在人间鼠疫已经控制，原来的内蒙古、浙江等省和自治区的鼠疫区，已无病人。此外其他一些传染病的发病率五年来也有显著下降。例如斑疹伤寒发病率1956年比1951年下降了89％，回归热下降了91％。血吸虫病在我国的流行已有六十多年历史，在反动统治时代，只是听之任之地长期危害劳动人民，特别是农民。解放后，党和政府立即开始注意防治，目前已有三百零九个市县全面展开了防治工作；已建立了十九个专门防治所，二百三十六个防治站，一千三百四十六个防治组。解放后至1957年第一季度，全国已治疗了血吸虫病患者七十六万人。疟疾在我国也有长期的流行历史，历代王朝和国民党也是听之任之，从未进行过任何防治。现在我们在流行的省分所建立的专门防治所（站）已有四十九个，专门防治组七十二个。国家每年生产的治疟药就有数十吨，再加上其他中药抗疟药品，每年有大量病人得到治疗和预防。1956年全国虽有很大水灾，但发病人数仍比1955年下降70％。黑热病流行在我国长江以北广大地区，解放后调查全国约有六十万患者。五年来人民政府成立专门防治机构二十四个，训练了一万余名基层防治人员，从解放以来到1956年为止，全国已治疗病人六十余万。今后再加上各种积极的预防措施，预计不久的将来，即可消灭黑热病。五年来在防止新生儿破伤风和产妇产褥热等病方面也获得了显著成绩。现在我国的婴儿死亡率已由解放前的千分之二百下降为千分之七十点三。一些大城市如北京、南京的产妇产褥热几乎已无死亡病例。
    以预防疾病和开展环境卫生为主要内容的卫生防疫站，在解放前是没有的。到1957年6月底的统计，全国已建立了一千三百三十多个，比1952年增长了八倍多。公立妇幼保健所（站）已有三千八百多个，比1952年增长一点九倍；比解放前增长四百二十七倍。各种专科疾病防治所（站）已有六百一十七所，比1952年增长了两倍多，比解放前增长了八十七倍多。
    卫生工作和群众运动相结合，是社会主义卫生事业的又一特点。起到移风易俗作用的爱国卫生运动，是卫生工作与群众运动相结合的突出范例。爱国卫生运动中规模最大的工作是环境卫生和除四害，许多居民数年如一日地坚持着清扫、灭蚊蝇等卫生工作制度，他们对讲求卫生已成习惯。
    人民的医疗条件有了显著的改善。到1957年6月底，全国医院和疗养院已有四千八百多所，病床和疗养病床位增加到三十三万九千多张，比1952年增长一倍多，比解放前1947年最高床位数增长了四倍多。国家投资建立的卫生所、门诊所、厂矿企业保健所（站）等卫生医疗组织到1957年6月已发展到两万三千四百多个，比1952年增长零点七倍多，比解放前增长五十二点七倍。
    几年来医疗技术水平也有了提高，在县区医院一般也能进行较为复杂的手术和解决一般疑难病症。特别是中西医合作，发扬祖国医学技术以来，对某些疾病的治疗效果更有显著提高，全国医院治愈率也随之增高，从病床的周转情况来看，可以说明治愈的速度。1954年全国医院病床平均每张每年收治病人十九点一人次，1956年已增至二十二点五人次。
    新中国的医疗预防组织改变了旧中国时代只为资产阶级、地主阶级服务的状态，面向工农兵大众。除了人民解放军有自己的卫生组织系统外，在工业地区和厂矿企业中，建立了大批医疗机构；在重点工业省市建立了二百七十二个防疫站，并且配备了许多医药防疫人员。旧社会遗留下的厂矿不卫生、工人健康没有保障的状况已大为改变。农村的医疗预防机构同样有了空前规模的发展。
    这些年来卫生工作队伍的壮大也是迅速的。1950年全国有西医师、药剂师共四万二千人，1956年增至七万五千以上。这五年中，全国中、初级卫生人员增加了一倍半，还有大约五十万中医人员尚未计在内。为了进一步扩大卫生工作队伍和提高他们的水平，党和政府对医学教育工作十分重视。现在全国高等医药院校有三十八所；中等医药卫生学校有一百七十六所。
    医学科学研究方面，旧中国只有一个“中央卫生实验院”，现在除了医学科学研究中心——中国医学科学院和中国协和医学院外；还建立了中医研究院、寄生虫病研究所、流行病学研究所、皮肤性病研究所、结核病研究所、劳动卫生研究所、生物制品研究所和海南疟疾研究站等三十四个研究机构。
    药材的供应，第一个五年计划期间也有了很大变化。1953年以前我国需要的药品器械70％到80％是依靠国外进口，而现在全国需要的药材80％可以生产自给。
    五年来，由于医药条件不断提高，我国许多疾病的病死率均有显著下降。例如麻疹死亡率1951年为5.5％，1956年已下降到1.6％，猩红热病死亡率从8.5％下降到1.1％。痢疾死亡率从1.1％降到0.45％。回归热死亡率从11.1％降到1.9％。
