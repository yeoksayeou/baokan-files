People's thinking often lags behind reality, and they underestimate the speed of objective developments. Looking back at 1957, who can deny this conclusion regarding the development of the international and domestic situation?

The successful launch of two Soviet artificial satellites and the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties transformed the entire world situation in a matter of weeks. The Soviet artificial satellites went into space, marking the beginning of a new era in mankind's further conquest of nature and convincingly proving the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. The Moscow Conference demonstrated that the world communist movement has achieved a brilliant victory, with communist forces unprecedentedly strong and united. The East wind prevails over the West wind, and the forces of socialism outweigh the forces of imperialism; if there was still debate about this not long ago, even among communists, it has now become common knowledge in the Western world. Now, the spokesmen of Western imperialism are no longer talking about "the crisis of communism," "the decline of the Soviet Union," etc., but about "the crisis of the free world" and "America's backwardness."

While socialist forces were rising rapidly, the national independence movements in Asian and African countries made great progress in the past year. The high tide of national independence movements swept from Asia to Africa. After the Egyptian people won the victory in the war against the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel, the Syrian people crushed the domestic coup planned by US and British imperialism and successfully thwarted the US and Turkish invasion plot. The Indonesian people launched a large-scale patriotic movement to recover West Irian, resolutely striking at the forces of Dutch colonialists. Ghana and Malaya have declared independence. In Algeria, Yemen, Oman, Spanish Morocco, and other places, anti-colonialist struggles are raging everywhere. The Asian-African Solidarity Conference currently being held in Cairo powerfully expresses the upsurge of the struggle of the 1.8 billion Asian and African people, who account for two-thirds of the world's population, for independence, freedom, and world peace. The independence movements of Asian and African countries have profoundly shaken the foundation of colonialism and greatly weakened the forces of imperialism. Socialist forces and the national independence movements of Asian and African countries support each other, constituting a powerful force for safeguarding world peace in the contemporary era.

The situation in the imperialist camp is the opposite of that in socialist countries and anti-colonialist forces. Due to the unprecedented unity and strength of socialist forces, the rise of national independence movements in Asian and African countries, and the development of peace movements in various countries, the difficulties of imperialism have greatly increased, and their internal contradictions have become more acute. US imperialism's intervention in Syria and Indonesia was unsuccessful, and its empty threats against socialist countries also failed. After the Soviet Union successfully launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and artificial satellites, while the US "Vanguard" satellite test failed, US imperialism's foreign policy based on "position of strength" completely went bankrupt. This situation cannot but arouse Western European countries' resistance to the US policy of stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, and cannot but intensify the contradictions between the US and its allies. The North Atlantic Group's summit conference held in Paris not long ago, on the one hand, certainly reflected the US ruling group's attempt to urge its Western European allies to speed up the pace of arms expansion and war preparations, but on the other hand, and more importantly, reflected the failure of the US imperialism's original plan.

The three international conferences of 1957—the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties, the North Atlantic Group Summit, and the Asian-African Solidarity Conference—so vividly demonstrated the new turning point of our era, with socialist forces and national independence movements in various countries on the rise, and imperialism on the decline. The cause of peace, democracy, and socialism presents infinitely beautiful prospects. Of course, people should also see that the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is trying to reverse its decline; the US ruling group is frantically plotting to accelerate arms expansion and war preparations; and even some warmongers are advocating "preemptive" wars. Therefore, peace-loving people all over the world must maintain high vigilance, continue to strive for peace, and never allow the US aggressive group's war policy to succeed. Now, the socialist forces are united with the national independence movements and peace movements of various countries, and have sufficient strength to stop the imperialist war plot. The peace-loving people of all countries, persisting in the struggle, will certainly be able to stop the arms race and achieve peaceful coexistence. Looking forward to the future, the peace-loving people of all countries are full of confidence that in 1958, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union will become more united and stronger, the national independence movements of various countries will achieve greater victories, the world peace movement will become more surging, the international situation will be further eased, and the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism will achieve greater success.

In our country, 1957 was also a year of brilliant victory for the people of the whole country on all fronts.

In the past year, our country launched a nationwide rectification campaign and a struggle against bourgeois rightists. This was a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, following the basic completion of the socialist revolution on the economic front (in terms of the ownership of the means of production) in 1955 and 1956. After the basic completion of the socialist revolution on the economic front, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the struggle between the capitalist road and the socialist road, remained the main contradiction in the transition period. The struggle between the capitalist road and the socialist road, under the current conditions in our country, manifests itself as contradictions between ourselves and the enemy (the contradiction between the bourgeois rightists and the working people) in a relatively small number of cases, while in the vast majority of cases it manifests itself as contradictions among the people. Moreover, among the contradictions among the people, some belong to the nature of the struggle between the two roads, while others do not belong to or do not completely belong to this nature. Therefore, at the beginning of 1957, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the issue of correctly handling contradictions among the people, and then launched a rectification campaign with the theme of handling contradictions among the people. Taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign, the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, arousing great indignation among the broad masses of people across the country. Thus, the rectification campaign entered the stage mainly dealing with contradictions between ourselves and the enemy - the stage of the anti-Rightist struggle. After a large-scale anti-Rightist struggle, the attack of the bourgeois Rightists was crushed, the Rightists were isolated, the political awareness of the people was greatly improved, and the socialist system was further consolidated. This was a great victory for the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts of our people. At present, the rectification movement in most units across the country has shifted from the anti-Rightist struggle to the stage of rectification as the main task, that is, to the stage that still takes handling contradictions among the people as the main task. The methods of big blooming, big contending, and big-character posters that appeared in the rectification movement have proved to be not only effective methods for educating and uniting the people to fight against the enemy, but also effective methods for correctly handling contradictions among the people. In the rectification movement, the revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and the people has been greatly enhanced, which has powerfully promoted the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country.

The current task is to strive for a complete victory in this rectification movement on all fronts before May 1958. The rectification movement is the driving force for promoting all work and should be regarded as the "key link for lifting all work." The rectification movement should be thoroughly implemented in organs, groups, industrial and mining enterprises, rural areas, and urban residents, so that everyone in the country receives the education of the rectification movement. All units that have won the anti-Rightist struggle should shift to the stage of rectification as the main task, resolutely rectify their style of work and improve their work, and overcome bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism. After the rectification comes to an end, they should shift to the stage of individuals studying documents, criticizing and reflecting, and improving themselves, criticizing bourgeois ideas and petty-bourgeois ideas such as individualism, departmentalism, liberalism, and absolute egalitarianism, establishing proletarian socialist ideas, and striving for the victory of ideological transformation. Throughout the entire process of the rectification movement, the method of the mass line of big blooming, big contending, and big-character posters should be used to criticize wrong ideas, draw clear lines between right and wrong, improve mass awareness, and overcome shortcomings in work. In this way, we will make our country appear in a political situation that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, and both unified in will and personally happy and lively. This will be a significant harvest of the rectification movement. We believe that the successful completion of this rectification movement will make the social outlook of our country completely new, will make the enthusiasm of the people unprecedentedly high, and will set off a large-scale upsurge in the development of industrial and agricultural production and various construction works.

Driven by the nationwide rectification movement, socialist construction in our country achieved great achievements in 1957. 1957 was the last year of our country's first five-year plan. In this year, our country's industrial and agricultural production continued to grow significantly. In terms of industry, the total industrial output value in 1957 exceeded the planned target of the first five-year plan by about 17.3％, an increase of 132.5％ compared with 1952; steel production reached 5.24 million tons, pig iron 5.9 million tons, coal 128 million tons, power generation 19 billion kilowatt-hours, and cotton yarn 4.61 million pieces.

During the first five-year plan period, a total of 450 factories above the limit were built in our country, including 57 of the 156 projects aided by the Soviet Union. Our country now has modern industrial enterprises capable of manufacturing airplanes, automobiles, steam locomotives, ocean-going freighters, new machine tools, power generation, metallurgy, and mining equipment. In terms of agriculture, although 1957 suffered no small natural disasters, grain output still increased compared with 1956, reaching 370 billion catties, an increase of more than 61 billion catties compared with 1952; cotton reached 32.8 million dan, an increase of more than 6.7 million dan compared with 1952. Other industries such as transportation, commerce, culture, education, and health have also made great progress. Our country's first five-year plan has been successfully overfulfilled due to the hard work of the people across the country under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the USSR and other brother countries.

The completion of the first five-year plan is only the first step on the long march to build our country into a strong socialist country. To establish a modern industrial base and a modern agricultural base in our country, it will take ten to fifteen years from now. Only after ten to fifteen years of relatively full development of social productive forces will our socialist economic and political systems have their own relatively full material base (this base is still very insufficient now), and our country (superstructure) will be fully consolidated; the socialist society will be fundamentally built. We must catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in about fifteen years; after that, we must further develop productive forces and prepare to catch up with and surpass the United States economically in another twenty to thirty years, so as to gradually transition from socialist society to communist society. This is the glorious, great, and arduous historical task of the people of our country. Since the people of our country were able to overthrow the three great mountains that weighed on our heads—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—and since we have been able to make the economic and cultural construction of our country develop rapidly in a very short period of time, then we have every reason to believe that the people of our country will certainly be able to build our country into a strong country with modern industry and modern agriculture, and build a socialist society and a communist society. Our country is vast in territory, rich in resources, and has a large population. Our people are also diligent and brave, and our country has the most advanced socialist system. There is no reason not to make every effort to realize this great ideal.

1958 is the first year of our country's second five-year plan. We should use the great achievements of the rectification movement and the successful completion of the first five-year plan, as well as all other favorable conditions, to mobilize all positive factors and carry out various construction works more, faster, better, and more economically in accordance with the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, so as to create a successful start for the second five-year plan. The policy of our country's second five-year plan is to develop industry and agriculture simultaneously, on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. The policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry must not be wavered. During the second five-year plan period, heavy industry in our country must continue to develop at a high speed, and heavy industry serving agriculture must be developed more, and at the same time, light industry and transportation must be developed accordingly to meet the growing needs of the people's material and cultural life and the needs of socialist construction. Agriculture should have greater development in the second five-year plan than in the first five-year plan. The National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) put forward by the Party Central Committee is not only a program of action for farmers across the country, but also employees in various departments across the country should actively support the realization of the goals set out in this program draft. At present, an unprecedented production upsurge has been set off in rural areas across the country. Party committees at all levels must actively and properly lead this upsurge and strive for a great leap forward and a bumper harvest in agricultural production in 1958.

It all depends on human effort. Before 1957, who would have predicted that such huge changes would happen so quickly in the world and in China? If we are good at learning lessons, then the first thing we must do is to thoroughly correct the state of mind that lags behind objective reality, we must muster our energy and strive for the upstream, give full play to revolutionary initiative and creativity, and eliminate the negative, skeptical, and conservative old atmosphere. The drive at the end of 1955 and the beginning of 1956 once created a great leap forward in China's economic undertakings in 1956. At present, this drive is becoming active again and showing its power. Anhui Province originally planned to build 800 million cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects this winter and spring, but now it has overfulfilled the plan and decided to do another 800 million cubic meters of earthwork. What a valuable revolutionary spirit this is! Our cause is a revolutionary cause, and what we need most is revolutionary optimism, that is, to despise all "powerful" enemies and all "serious" difficulties strategically—although we need to attach importance to them tactically and conquer them one by one, but this can only be achieved on the premise of despising them strategically. The ancients said that we should "ride the long wind and break the waves of ten thousand miles." Before us are the waves of ten thousand miles: to build socialism and communism, to build a strong modern industry, modern agriculture, and advanced science and culture. But we have full confidence in achieving our goals. Let us ride the wind forward! Let us ride the East wind that overwhelms the West wind and ride the communist wind that overwhelms the Rightists, overwhelms bureaucracy, and overwhelms conservative ideas forward!

    乘风破浪
    人们的思想常常落后于实际，对于客观形势发展之快估计不足。回顾1957年，国际和国内形势的发展，谁能不得出这个结论来呢？
    苏联两颗人造卫星的发射成功，各国共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议，在几十天中间，把整个世界形势的面貌改变了。苏联人造卫星上了天，宣告了人类进一步征服自然界的新纪元的开始，最有说服力地证明了社会主义制度优于资本主义制度。莫斯科会议表明：世界共产主义运动已获得了辉煌的胜利，共产主义力量空前强大和空前团结。东风压倒西风，社会主义的力量胜过帝国主义的力量，和平的力量胜过战争的力量，如果在不久以前，甚至在共产主义者中间对于这一点还有争论的话，那么，现在在西方世界中，这却已经成为人们的常识了。现在西方帝国主义的代言人所谈论的，已经不再是什么“共产主义的危机”、“苏联的衰退”等等，而是“自由世界的危机”、“美国的落后”了。
    在社会主义力量迅速上升的同时，亚非各国民族独立运动在过去一年中有了巨大的发展。民族独立运动的高潮，从亚洲涌到了非洲。在埃及人民取得了反抗英法和以色列的侵略战争的胜利之后，叙利亚人民粉碎了美英帝国主义策划的国内政变，并且胜利地挫折了美国和土耳其的侵略阴谋。印度尼西亚人民展开了收复西伊里安的声势浩大的爱国运动，坚决打击荷兰殖民者的势力。加纳和马来亚已经宣布独立。在阿尔及利亚、也门、阿曼、西属摩洛哥等地，到处燃烧着反殖民主义斗争的烽火。目前正在开罗召开的亚非团结大会，有力地表达了占世界人口三分之二的十八亿亚非人民争取独立自由和世界和平的斗争的高涨。亚非各国人民的独立运动深刻地动摇了殖民主义的基础，大大地削弱了帝国主义的力量。社会主义力量和亚非各国民族独立运动互相支援，构成了当代维护世界和平的强大力量。
    帝国主义阵营的情况同社会主义各国和反殖民主义力量的情况相反。由于社会主义力量的空前团结和壮大，由于亚非各国民族独立运动的高涨，由于各国和平运动的发展，帝国主义的困难大大增加了，它们内部的矛盾更加尖锐了。美帝国主义对叙利亚和印度尼西亚的干涉都没有成功，对社会主义国家的虚声恫吓也失败了。在苏联发射洲际弹道火箭和人造卫星成功，而美国的“先锋”号卫星试验失败后，美帝国主义的以“实力地位”为基础的外交政策，彻底破产了。这种情况不能不引起西欧各国对美国加紧扩军备战政策的抗拒，不能不引起美国和它的盟国之间的矛盾尖锐化。不久以前在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团最高会议，一方面固然反映了美国统治集团妄图督促其西欧盟国加紧扩军备战步调，但是另一方面更重要的是反映了美帝国主义的原定计划的失败。
    1957年国际上三个会议——各国共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议、北大西洋集团最高会议和亚非团结大会——如此生动地表明了我们时代的新的转折点，社会主义力量和各国民族独立运动正在走上坡路，而帝国主义正在走下坡路。和平、民主、社会主义事业展现着无限美好的前景。当然，人们也应该看到，以美国为首的帝国主义集团正力图扭转它们的颓势；美国统治集团正疯狂地策划加速扩军备战；甚至有些战争狂人竟鼓吹“先发制人”的战争。因此，全世界爱好和平人民必须保持高度的警惕，再接再厉地为和平而奋斗，决不能让美国侵略集团的战争政策得逞。现在，社会主义力量同各国民族独立运动和各国和平运动团结在一起，有足够的力量制止帝国主义的战争阴谋。各国爱好和平人民坚持斗争，一定能够停止军备竞赛，实现和平共处。瞻望未来，各国爱和平的人民满怀信心，在1958年中，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营必将更加团结和壮大，各国民族独立运动必将取得更大的胜利，世界和平运动必将更加高涨，国际局势必将有进一步的缓和，和平、民主、社会主义事业必将获得更大的成就。
    在我国，1957年也是全国人民在各个战线上取得辉煌胜利的一年。
    在过去的一年中，我国展开了全民性的整风运动和反对资产阶级右派的斗争。这是继1955年和1956年基本上完成了在经济战线上（生产资料所有制方面）的社会主义革命之后的、在政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命。在经济战线上基本完成了社会主义革命之后，资产阶级和无产阶级之间的斗争，资本主义道路和社会主义道路之间的斗争，依然是过渡时期的主要矛盾。资本主义道路和社会主义道路的斗争，在我国目前的条件下，表现为敌我矛盾（资产阶级右派同劳动人民之间的矛盾）的情况是比较少数的，表现为人民内部矛盾则是大量的。而且，人民内部矛盾有属于两条道路斗争性质的，也有不属于或者不完全属于这种性质的。因此，在1957年初，党中央和毛主席提出了正确处理人民内部矛盾问题，接着又展开了以处理人民内部矛盾为主题的整风运动。资产阶级右派乘共产党整风的机会，对党、对社会主义发动了猖狂的进攻，激起了全国广大人民群众的极大的义愤。因而整风运动就进入以处理敌我矛盾为主的阶段——反右派斗争阶段。经过了声势浩大的反右派斗争，资产阶级右派的进攻被粉碎了，右派分子被孤立了，人民群众的政治觉悟大大提高了，社会主义制度更加巩固了。这是我国人民在政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命的一次伟大胜利。目前，全国多数单位的整风运动已经从反右派斗争转入以整改为主的阶段，即转入仍然以处理人民内部矛盾为主的阶段。在整风运动中出现的大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报的方法，已经证明不但是教育和团结人民群众对敌人进行斗争的有效方法，而且是正确处理人民内部矛盾的有效方法。在整风运动中，干部和人民群众的革命积极性大大提高，有力地推动了我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    当前的任务是在1958年5月以前，争取这次整风运动在各个战线上取得完全的胜利。整风运动是推动一切工作的动力，应该把整风运动作为“提起一切工作的纲”。在机关团体、工矿企业、农村、城镇居民中全面地贯彻整风运动，使全国人人都受到整风的教育。凡是反右派斗争取得了胜利的单位，都应转入以整改为主的阶段，坚决整顿作风和改进工作，克服官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义；在整改告一段落之后，应转入各人学习文件、批评反省、提高自己的阶段，批判个人主义、本位主义、自由主义和绝对平均主义等资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级的社会主义的思想，争取改造思想的胜利。在整风运动的整个过程中，都应该通过大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报的群众路线的方法，批判错误思想，划清是非界限，提高群众觉悟，克服工作缺点。这样，就将使我国出现这样一种政治局面，这就是一个又有集中又有民主的、又有纪律又有自由的、又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面。这将是整风运动的有重大意义的收获。我们相信，胜利地完成这次整风运动，将使我国社会面貌焕然一新，将使人民群众的积极性空前高涨，将掀起一个发展工农业生产和各项建设工作的规模宏大的高潮。
    在全民整风运动的推动下，我国1957年的社会主义建设获得了巨大的成就。1957年是我国第一个五年计划的最后一年，在这一年中，我国工农业生产继续有了很大的增长。工业方面，1957年工业总产值超过了第一个五年计划预定指标的17.3％左右，比1952年增长了132.5％；钢产量达到了五百二十四万吨，生铁五百九十万吨，煤一亿二千八百万吨，发电量一百九十亿度，棉纱四百六十一万件。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我国共有四百五十个限额以上的工厂建成，其中包括苏联援助的一百五十六项中的五十七项。我国现在已经拥有能够制造飞机、汽车、蒸汽机车、远洋货轮、新式机床、发电、冶金和矿山设备等近代工业企业。农业方面，1957年虽然遭受不小自然灾害，粮食产量仍比1956年增产，达到三千七百亿斤，比1952年增加了六百一十多亿斤；棉花达到三千二百八十万担，比1952年增加了六百七十多万担。其他如交通运输业、商业以及文教、卫生事业，也都有了很大的发展。我国第一个五年计划，由于全国人民在党的领导下辛勤努力，由于苏联以及其他兄弟国家的帮助，已经胜利地超额完成了。
    第一个五年计划的完成仅仅是把我国建设成为社会主义强国的万里长征中的第一步。在我国建立一个现代化的工业基础和现代化的农业基础，从现在算起，还要十年到十五年的时间。只有经过十年到十五年的社会生产力的比较充分的发展，我们的社会主义经济制度和政治制度，才算有了自己的比较充分的物质基础（这个基础现在还很不充分），我们的国家（上层建筑）才算充分巩固；社会主义社会才算从根本上建成。我们要在十五年左右的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国；在这以后，还要进一步发展生产力，准备再用二十年到三十年的时间在经济上赶上并且超过美国，以便逐步地由社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会。这是我国人民光荣的伟大的和艰巨的历史任务。我国人民既然能够推翻了压在我们头上的三座大山——帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，既然又能够在很短的时间内使我国的经济建设和文化建设有了飞跃的发展，那么我们就完全有理由相信，我国人民一定能够把我国建设成为现代工业和现代农业的强国，建设成为社会主义社会和共产主义社会。我国地大、物博、人多，我国人民又勤劳又勇敢，我国又有了最先进的社会主义制度，没有任何理由不去尽最大努力实现这个远大的理想。
    1958年是我国第二个五年计划的第一年。我们应该利用整风运动的伟大成就和第一个五年计划的胜利完成以及其他一切有利条件，调动一切积极的因素，根据勤俭建国的方针，又多又快又好又省地进行各项建设工作，为第二个五年计划创造一个胜利的开端。我国第二个五年计划的方针，是在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业同时并举。优先发展重工业的方针是决不能动摇的。在第二个五年计划期间，必须使我国重工业继续高速度地发展，并且使为农业服务的重工业有更多的发展，同时还要相应地发展轻工业和交通运输业，以适应日益增长的人民物质生活和文化生活的需要、以及社会主义建设的需要。农业在第二个五年计划中应该比第一个五年有更大的发展。党中央提出的全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），不仅是全国农民的行动纲领，而且全国各个部门的职工也应当积极支持实现这个纲要草案所规定的目标。目前全国农村已经掀起了空前的生产高潮。各地党委必须积极地妥善地领导这个高潮，争取1958年农业生产的大跃进和大丰收。
    事在人为。在1957年以前，人们何尝预料到，在世界和中国，会如此迅速地发生如此巨大的变化？如果我们善于接受教训，那末，我们首先就必须彻底纠正那种落后于客观实际的思想状态，就必须鼓足干劲，力争上游，充分发挥革命的积极性创造性，扫除消极、怀疑、保守的暮气。1955年底1956年初的干劲，曾经造成1956年的我国经济事业中的大跃进。目前，这种干劲又在活跃起来，显出威力来了。安徽全省去冬今春原计划兴修水利八亿土方，现在已经超额完成，并且决定再做八亿土方。这是一种何等可贵的革命气概！我们的事业是革命的事业，最最需要的就是革命的乐观主义，就是在战略上藐视一切“强大”的敌人，藐视一切“严重”的艰难困苦——虽然在战术上需要重视它们，需要一个一个地加以征服，但是这也只有在战略上藐视它们的前提之下才能够实现。古人说要“乘长风破万里浪”，在我们的面前正是万里浪：建成社会主义和共产主义，建成强大的现代工业、现代农业和先进的科学文化。但是我们完全有信心达到目的。让我们乘风前进！让我们乘压倒西风的东风前进，乘压倒右派、压倒官僚主义、压倒保守思想的共产主义风前进！
