Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 20th: Today marks the second anniversary of the implementation of full joint state-private ownership in all private industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai. The Shanghai newspapers "Liberation," "News," and "Labor" prominently featured news of the tremendous achievements of Shanghai's joint ventures over the past two years on their front pages. The Liberation Daily also dedicated a special page titled "Two Years Ago Today, Gongs and Drums Resounded as We Applied for Joint State-Private Ownership; Today, We Are Determined to Continue Transforming Ourselves."

The total output value of Shanghai's joint state-private industrial enterprises over the past two years reached 16.4 billion yuan, equivalent to the total output value of these enterprises from 1953 to 1955. Over the past two years, the main products of joint ventures in industry, such as steel, metal cutting machine tools, AC generators, cotton cloth, and silk fabrics, have increased by 16% to more than two times. Product quality has also generally improved. In 1957, the labor productivity of the city's joint ventures in industry increased by 27.3% compared to 1955 before the joint venture. In the past two years, joint ventures have successfully trial-produced thousands of new products such as semiconductor thermoelectric generators, high-grade glass fiber, organic glass, and blended silk, wool, and linen fabrics.

After more than 140,000 private shops and stalls implemented joint state-private ownership or formed cooperative shops and cooperative groups, the Shanghai market has undergone great changes. In 1957, these shops and groups prospered, with total retail sales reaching 1.46 billion yuan, an increase of 31.5% compared to 1955 before the joint venture. The situation of years of losses in many stores during the private period has changed. In the past two years, the surplus of joint venture and cooperative commerce reached 1.09 million yuan. In the past two years, the state has systematically adjusted the distribution network of joint venture stores. Several thousand stores have expanded their businesses by merging or moved from deserted streets to factory areas and residential areas. This has not only brought new prosperity to joint venture commerce but also made these areas more tidy and the market more active.

    上海私营工商业全行业合营两年
    工业产值两年顶三年　许多商店亏损变盈余
    新华社上海20日电　今天是上海市全部私营工商业实行公私合营的二周年，上海“解放”、“新闻”和“劳动”三报以头版显著地位刊登了这两年上海合营企业获得巨大成绩的消息。解放日报还辟了题为“前年今日锣鼓喧天申请公私合营，今岁今朝下定决心继续改造自己”的专页。
    上海公私合营工业这两年的生产总值共达一百六十四亿元，相当于这些企业1953年到1955年三年的总产值。两年来，合营工业的钢、金属切削机床、交流发电机、棉布和丝织品等主要产品分别增长了16％到二倍多。产品质量也普遍提高。1957年全市合营工业的劳动生产率比合营前的1955年增长了27.3％。两年中合营企业试制成功了半导体温差发电机、高级玻璃丝、有机玻璃、混纺的丝、毛、麻织品等数千种新产品。
    十四万多户私营商店、摊贩实行公私合营或组成合作商店、合作小组以后，上海市场面貌发生了很大变化。1957年，这些商店和小组生意兴隆，零售总额达到十四亿六千多万元，比合营前的1955年增长31.5％。许多商店私营时期历年亏损的局面已经改变。两年中合营和合作化商业盈余达一百零九万元。国家这两年有计划地调整了合营商店的分布网，有几千家商店采取合并方式扩大了商场或者从冷落街道迁移到工厂区和居民住宅区，这不但给合营商业带来了新的繁荣，也使这些地区市容更加整齐、市场更加活跃。
