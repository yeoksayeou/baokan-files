    Love Labor, Care for the Collective, Observe Discipline
    University Students in the Capital Establish a New Style of Study
    (Our Newspaper dispatch) Responding enthusiastically to the Party's call in the rectification campaign, university students in the capital are rapidly sweeping away the remaining old ideas and habits in schools, and beginning to establish a socialist new style of study characterized by hard work, love of labor, care for the collective, and observance of discipline.
    With great enthusiasm, the majority of students are participating in voluntary labor both on and off campus. "Go to the countryside for labor!" has become a popular slogan. Most schools have established fixed connections with agricultural production cooperatives. Since the beginning of winter, many students have braved the wind and snow to help agricultural production cooperatives with water conservancy projects and rush to harvest Chinese cabbage. In just over two months, Beijing University, Beijing Normal University, and Beijing Institute of Geology Exploration alone have sent over 16,000 students to the countryside to participate in voluntary labor.
    At Tsinghua University, all faculty, staff, and students actively participated in voluntary road repair on campus. Each class formed a voluntary labor team, with each person working two hours per week. The students' enthusiasm for labor was very high, and the quantity and quality of their work generally met the standards. Road construction workers commented on the students, saying they "work like tigers" and "pull carts as fast as flying." In one month and eight days, they completed 1,800 meters of road surface, covering an area of approximately 6,910 square meters, equivalent to 4,000 workdays, saving the state approximately 6,000 yuan. Students at Beijing University have participated in over 15,000 instances of voluntary labor on campus.
    "Hard work and frugality in running schools" has become the actual practice of the majority of students. Students in various schools have made outstanding achievements in saving grain, water, electricity, and coal. Students pay attention to cherishing every grain of rice when eating, and the phenomenon of leftover rice and steamed buns has generally been eliminated in student dining halls. Students concentrate in classrooms for self-study in the evenings, improving the utilization rate of electricity. Beijing Normal University saved 13% of electricity consumption in one month, saving 480 yuan. Tsinghua University, Beijing University, Beijing Normal University and other schools also held anti-waste exhibitions, displaying instruments, books, discarded specimens, clothes, medicines, etc. that had been damaged by students. The shocking phenomenon of waste stung the hearts of the majority of students. Many students responded to these criticisms with practical actions. Students from the Chemistry and Geography departments of Beijing Normal University established a "Frugality in Running Schools" group to further expose the phenomenon of waste in the school, and they repaired books and collected specimens themselves. Students from the Biology department formulated laboratory inspection measures, mutually supervising each other to comply with experimental operating procedures and cherish instruments. Some students, on the basis of improved ideological awareness and after realistic consideration, voluntarily gave up or applied to reduce their scholarship benefits.
    Since participating in the rectification campaign, the political enthusiasm of the majority of students has generally increased, and the study of current affairs has become more serious than in the past. The enthusiasm for participating in political activities has also generally increased. During this period, students' democratic life was very active. Students boldly put forward criticisms and suggestions to school leaders, and criticism and self-criticism among students were also widely carried out. A style of free debate has formed among students at Beijing Petroleum Institute, Tsinghua University, and other schools. When debating "Is participating in physical labor a necessary path for the transformation of intellectuals?" at Beijing Petroleum Institute, many debates were held. Students debated fiercely at the debates, and one could hear groups of students debating fiercely in dormitories and on the roads at any time. The mass movement of "changing customs and habits" in higher education institutions in the capital is developing in depth. In this bustling movement, university students are increasingly deeply experiencing the glory, greatness, and correctness of the Party. Many students say, "Our feelings for the Party are getting deeper and deeper."

    热爱劳动　关心集体　遵守纪律
    首都大学生树立新学风
    本报讯　首都高等学校广大学生在整改工作中积极响应党的号召，迅速扫除着学校里残余的旧思想、旧习气，开始树立艰苦奋斗、热爱劳动、关心集体、遵守纪律的社会主义新学风。
    广大学生以极大的热情参加校内外的义务劳动，“下乡劳动去！”形成了一个热潮，大多数学校和农业生产合作社都建立了固定的联系，入冬以来，许多学生冒着风、踏着雪，帮助农业生产合作社兴修水利、抢收白菜。两个多月来，仅北京大学、北京师范大学、北京地质勘探学院三个学校，就有一万六千多人次下乡参加了义务劳动。
    清华大学全校师生员工积极参加了校内修路的义务劳动，各班成立了义务劳动队，每人每周劳动二小时，学生的劳动热情十分高涨，劳动的数量和质量一般都达到了标准。筑路工人给学生的评语是“干活似猛虎”“拉车如飞快”。在一个月零八天的时间内，完成路面长一千八百公尺，面积约六千九百一十平方公尺，折合四千个工，为国家节省六千元左右。北京大学学生参加校内义务劳动达到一万五千多人次。
    “艰苦奋斗、勤俭办校”已经变成广大学生的实际行动，各校学生在节约粮食、水、电、煤等方面做出了出色的成绩。同学们吃饭时注意珍惜每一颗粮食，学生饭厅一般都消灭了剩饭、剩馒头的现象；学生晚上集中到教室上自习，提高了电灯的利用率，北京师范大学一个月里就节约用电13％，节省开支四百八十元。清华大学、北京大学、北京师范大学等校还举办了反浪费展览会，陈列了被学生损坏的仪器、图书、被遗弃的标本、衣服、药品等等，触目惊心的浪费现象，刺痛了广大同学的心。许多学生用实际行动回答了这些批评。北京师范大学化学系、地理系学生成立了“勤俭办校”小组，进一步揭发了学校中的浪费现象，并且自己动手修补图书、收集标本，生物系学生制定了实验室检查办法，互相督促遵守实验操作规程，爱护仪器。有些学生在思想觉悟提高的基础上，经过实事求是的考虑，自动放弃或申请降低助学金的待遇。
    广大学生参加整改工作以来，政治热情普遍高涨，时事学习比过去认真了。参加政治活动的积极性也普遍提高。这一时期，学生的民主生活十分活跃，学生们大胆地向学校领导提出批评和建议，同学间的批评与自我批评也广泛地开展起来。北京石油学院、清华大学等校学生中已形成了自由争辩的风气，北京石油学院在辩论“参加体力劳动是不是知识分子改造必经之途”时，举行了许多辩论会，同学们在辩论会上争论得很热烈，在宿舍里、马路上还随时可以听到三三两两的学生在激烈地争辩着。首都高等学校“移风易俗”的群众运动正在深入发展，在这热火朝天的运动里，大学生越来越深刻地体会到党的光荣、伟大、正确，许多学生说，“对党的感情愈来愈深了。”
