Rich and Colorful Winter Vacation Life for Primary and Secondary School Students

    (Our newspaper reports) More than 68 million primary and secondary school students across the country have successively entered a rich and colorful winter vacation life.

    Before the start of the vacation, education departments at all levels and the Communist Youth League provincial and municipal committees attached great importance to students' off-campus education during the vacation and successively issued instructions and specific arrangements.

    Now, the winter vacation life of primary and secondary school students has begun to become active. In Jinan City, Shandong Province, in addition to organizing students to participate in labor in the suburbs, various secondary schools are also preparing to organize commando teams to help farmers carry out "eliminate the four pests" activities twice. Some students from Shandong Provincial Experimental Middle School who live in the city will live and work in the countryside for a few days with students whose families live in the countryside during the holidays; female students living in the school also organize work-study groups to carry out labor. All students above the higher primary level in rural areas of Jiangsu Province will actively participate in labor such as water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and greening; students in towns and cities will also help agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs with production. Regardless of whether they are students in rural or urban areas, they will also participate in activities such as eliminating illiteracy, eliminating the four pests, and household chores. Primary school students in Jin County, Liaoning Province, launched a fertilizer accumulation activity of "one load of manure per vacation." According to statistics from thirty-nine primary schools in ten days, more than 248,000 kilograms of fertilizer have been accumulated. In the "eliminate the four pests" activities, statistics from forty-nine schools in Jin County alone show that 2,644 sparrows and 3,634 rats were caught, and many sparrow holes and rat holes were also blocked. After participating in labor in urban factories, construction sites, service industries, etc., students in the third grade and above of junior high schools in Guangzhou will go to the countryside for a period of time to eat, live, and work with farmers, and conduct some investigation and research work. Students from various schools in Shaanxi Province are full of confidence and will participate in the socialist debate in rural areas or cities during the winter vacation and conduct various investigation and research activities in order to improve their political and ideological awareness. Students from Lueyang Middle School, through participating in the socialist debate, proposed that each person should teach farmers one character every day, so as to truly achieve the ability to recognize, speak, write and use it.

    While engaging in meaningful labor in various aspects during the winter vacation, the vast number of students also closely grasp the review of lessons and do their winter vacation homework well. Students in Wuliu Lane in Xi'an City contracted the sanitation work of all streets in Wuliu Lane. Every morning at six o'clock, they all went out to sweep the streets, and even some areas that used to be "three no-go zones" were cleaned up. After cleaning, they reviewed their lessons and did their winter vacation homework. In Guangzhou, some primary and secondary school students have also voluntarily organized many groups to review lessons and read extracurricular books. These groups also pay special attention to assigning outstanding Communist Youth League members and students to help students with poor grades or students from worker-peasant backgrounds to review their lessons well.

    In addition to participating in labor exercises, primary and secondary school students also carried out rich and colorful cultural activities. Teachers and students of Chang'an Normal School organized a winter vacation propaganda team and rehearsed recreational programs such as "Blood and Tears of Hatred," "A Grain-Deficient Household," "Socialism is Good," and "Anti-Rightist Struggle" to tour rural areas. This propaganda team has performed three shows in Sifu Village and Wangqu Town in Chang'an County, with an audience of 5,000 people per show, and the propaganda effect is very good. Students in Lingqian District and Shahekou District in Jin County, Liaoning Province, also organized competitions in ball games, chess, etc., as well as magic appreciation and art exhibitions. The Communist Youth League of Dalian City Committee and the Dalian Children's Cultural Center also organized acrobatics and film appreciation sessions for students during the winter vacation. More than 40 gatherings such as meetings with veteran workers and storytelling were organized in the Workers' Cultural Palace. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Gardens, the Bureau of Culture, the Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, the Sports Commission, the Science Popularization Department, and the People's Broadcasting Station have all taken the initiative to take some measures to conduct off-campus education for primary and secondary school students during the holidays. All districts in the city have also opened children's ice rinks, held ice sports, and organized students to read extracurricular books and perform costume shows.

    These educational activities have provided good education to the vast number of primary and secondary school students.

    中小学生寒假生活丰富多采
    本报讯　全国六千八百多万中小学学生，已先后进入丰富多采的寒假生活。
    在放假前，各级教育部门和共青团省、市委，都十分重视假期中的学生校外教育，先后作了指示和具体安排。
    现在，中小学生假期生活开始活跃起来了。山东省济南市各中等学校，除了组织学生到郊区参加劳动外，还准备组织突击队帮助农民开展“除四害”活动两次。山东省实验中学家在城市的学生，有的在假期随家在农村的学生到农村去生活、劳动几天；住校的女学生还组织勤工俭学小组进行劳动。江苏省凡是农村高小以上的学生，将积极参与兴修水利、积肥、绿化等劳动；市镇的学生也要帮助郊区农业社生产。不论农村或市镇的学生，还要参加扫除文盲、消灭四害、家务劳动等活动。辽宁省金县小学生开展了“假期一担粪”的积肥活动。据三十九个小学十天的统计，已积肥二十四万八千多斤。在“除四害”活动中，仅金县四十九个学校的统计，就捕捉麻雀两千六百四十四只，老鼠三千六百三十四只，还堵了很多雀洞和鼠洞。广州市初中三年级以上的学生，在参加城市的工厂、工地、服务性行业等劳动以后，还要去农村一个时期，和农民同吃、同住、同劳动，并进行一些调查访问工作。陕西省各学校学生充满信心，要在寒假中参加农村或城市的社会主义大辩论，进行各种调查访问活动，以便提高政治思想觉悟。略阳中学学生通过参加社会主义大辩论，提出每人每天要给农民教会一个字，切实做到会认会讲会写会用。
    广大学生在寒假中，从事各方面有意义的劳动同时，还紧密地抓紧温习功课，作好寒假作业。西安市五柳巷的学生包干了五柳巷所有街道的卫生工作。他们每天早上六点钟就全体出动打扫街道，连一些过去“三不管”的地区也清扫得干干净净，打扫后就复习功课作寒假作业。广州市有的中小学校学生们还自愿结合组织许多温习功课、阅读课外书籍小组。这些小组还特别注意分配学习好的团员和学生，帮助功课差的学生或工农出身的学生温习好功课。
    中小学生除了参加劳动锻炼外，还进行了丰富多采的文化活动。长安师范师生组织了寒假宣传队，排演了“血泪仇”、“一个缺粮户”、“社会主义好”、“反右派斗争”等文娱节目，到农村巡回演出。这支宣传队已在长安县四府村、王曲镇等地演出了三场，每场观众达五千人，宣传的效果很好。辽宁省金县岭前区和沙河口区学生还组织了球类、棋类等比赛和魔术欣赏、美工展览等活动。共青团旅大市委和大连儿童文化馆还为寒假学生组织杂技、电影欣赏会。在工人文化宫组织和老工人见面会、讲故事等四十多次集会。北京市园林局、文化局、工会、妇联、体委、科普、人民广播电台等单位，都主动采取一些措施，对假期中的中小学生进行校外教育。全市各区还开辟了儿童冰场，举行冰上运动，组织学生课外阅读和化装表演。
    这些富有教育意义的活动，使广大中小学生受到良好的教育。
