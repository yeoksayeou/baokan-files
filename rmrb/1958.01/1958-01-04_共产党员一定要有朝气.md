Communists Must Be Energetic
Tie Ping

"Communists must be energetic and have a revolutionary will." This is the requirement put forward to Communist Party members by the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and it also puts forward an extremely important political and ideological education task for Party organizations.

Currently, in our country, from the south to the north, from the bases of industrial construction to remote mountain villages and fields, a magnificent and large-scale upsurge of socialist revolution and production construction has formed everywhere. Hundreds of thousands of cadres have taken up physical labor posts, millions of criticisms and suggestions are being adopted, and hundreds of millions of farmers are enthusiastically engaged in water conservancy construction... A scene of a great leap forward in revolution and construction truly makes the severe winter pale and fills the land with youthful vitality. All this convincingly shows that the communists who lead the Chinese people in socialist construction are full of the heroic spirit of "making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way," and are full of vigor and unyielding revolutionary perseverance. Only our Party can issue a world-shaking call to the people of the whole country—to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in about fifteen years! And only under the leadership of our Party can the Chinese people realize this historically rare feat with overwhelming power.

The vast majority of our Party members are energetic, and they are worthy of being promoters of all advancing causes. However, we must also see that there are also a small number of people in our ranks who lack energy. They are content with the status quo in their work, stick to conventions, and lack sensitivity to new things; when they encounter difficulties in their work, they do not use their own brains, nor do they see or fail to summarize the creations of the masses; the heated nationwide rectification movement does not cause waves in their minds, and they remain the same as before, without vigorous revolutionary feelings, and full of a philistine atmosphere in politics.

It is particularly worth noting that a very few Party members have completely lost their revolutionary will, and are only tirelessly pursuing personal fame, status, and enjoyment in life, and are preoccupied with personal gains and losses. They do not study theory at all, are tired of political struggle, are indifferent to the Party's political tasks, do not study their work, and just muddle through their work, "striking the clock like a monk for a day." Some even do not participate in organizational life for several years, or do not work at all. They do not say that they have deteriorated and forgotten their roots, but instead complain all day long that the Party "does not value" them. In their view, the ideal of life and the purpose of life are just spouses, children, and a comfortable material life. The reason why they are still willing to be "Party members" is only because they are afraid of losing their "Party ticket" and affecting their "meal ticket" or "official position." In fact, their thoughts and actions have long run counter to communism.

Is it because these people are old and lagging behind due to physiological decline? No, that is not the case at all. In our Party, the vast majority of veteran Party members, although they have suffered torture and are weak and sick in the long and arduous struggle, still make you feel their exuberant revolutionary enthusiasm and infinite confidence in the future when they work. And those whose revolutionary will has declined are mostly strong and healthy. They suffer from political decay.

If we carefully analyze the situation of some people who have lost their revolutionary will, we can find that many of these people have made certain contributions in the past revolutionary wars. But they are petty-bourgeois revolutionaries, not proletarian revolutionaries. In the eyes of the proletariat, seizing power and completing the democratic revolution is only the beginning of the revolution, and more arduous and greater tasks are yet to come. However, those whose revolutionary will has declined believe that the revolution has been "completed" and that it is time to "reward merits and enjoy happiness." They are not ideologically prepared to continue the socialist revolution, but instead have accepted the influence of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, with the victory of the democratic revolution, their revolutionary enthusiasm has also ended. This point is most obvious in the ideological changes of some Party members after the implementation of agricultural cooperativization in our country. There are also some people who originally came from exploiting classes and have not undergone ideological transformation after joining the Party. Their roots of personal fame and gain are very deep, and they are single-mindedly pursuing personal fame and status. When this kind of thought and behavior is suppressed, they become "frustrated" and are listless all day long, and feel bored with everything in the revolutionary cause. The Party's cause and the interests of the people are all empty talk to them, and they only think about "eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die." This kind of thought and behavior fully reflects the decadent and desperate mood of the declining landlord and bourgeois classes. There are also some people who lacked communist consciousness when they joined the Party, and joined the Party with the masses; they can be good citizens in society, but they cannot serve as members of the proletarian vanguard.

From the above, we must not regard the phenomenon of some Party members lacking energy or losing their revolutionary will as accidental. This is a reflection of changes in class relations in society in the thoughts and actions of our Party members. Some Party members have been influenced by the bourgeoisie, their thoughts have become moldy or even deteriorated, and they have been thrown far behind the times, or they reflect the declining mood of the exploiting classes who are about to withdraw from the stage of history. Although the people who have completely lost their revolutionary will are extremely few, some Party members have more or less been contaminated with this kind of dust, and therefore lack energy. This phenomenon of lacking energy is contrary to the requirements of realizing the Party's historical tasks. Therefore, the call to "be energetic" is of extremely serious significance to all Party members.

Revolutionary vigor and a strong revolutionary will are an attitude towards the revolutionary cause based on the proletarian stand, and are a manifestation of proletarian Party spirit. The proletariat shoulders the great historical task of transforming society and transforming the world. This task requires and determines that its nature is to always be full of vigorous vitality and be a promoter of advancing causes, and cannot stagnate. To maintain vigor, Communist Party members must firmly establish a communist outlook on life, be proletarian revolutionaries, not half-hearted revolutionaries; they must solemnly draw a clear line between all non-proletarian thoughts, serve the people wholeheartedly, not half-heartedly, and even less unintentionally. Only on this basis can there be truly lasting vigor and tenacious revolutionary will; and only energetic Communist Party members can serve as the "leaders" of socialism and lead the masses forward. Lethargy and passivity are incompatible with the Party spirit of a Communist Party member.

The common characteristic of all those who lack energy is that they are divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. "Running water does not become stale, and a door hinge does not become worm-eaten." Anyone who only lives in a small circle, divorced from the revolutionary struggle of the masses and the practice of production, and remains stagnant, cannot avoid contaminating various political dust and political microorganisms in their thoughts. If Communist Party members want to prevent their thoughts from becoming moldy and being contaminated with lethargy, they must frequently go deep among the masses, temper themselves in the furnace of revolutionary struggle, open up small circles, contact fresh air, keep their steps in sync with the times, and always stand at the forefront of the movement. For some people whose revolutionary will has declined, in addition to strengthening political and ideological education for them, Party organizations should guide them to go into production and into labor. The fire of the mass movement is a good remedy for dispelling mold and lethargy.

Another characteristic of those who lack energy is that they suffer from political myopia. The better living conditions after the victory of the revolution have not become favorable conditions for work, but have become a cage that imprisons their revolutionary will. Considerations of personal gains and losses have surpassed the interests of the revolution, and material desires have confused revolutionary conscience, causing them to lose their motivation to move forward, fear hardship, and covet comfort. Bourgeois individualism is the root of all evil. To be energetic, one must get rid of individualism, not be selfish, not be a prisoner of narrow personal material life, but firmly be a revolutionary fighter with lofty and far-reaching ideals. One must always be concerned about politics, broaden one's spiritual world, look forward politically, be the master of life, and not look backward and become a prisoner of life. One must study tirelessly, never be complacent, and always maintain a keen sense of new things.

Finally, the phenomenon of some Party members' revolutionary will declining or lacking energy is inseparable from the fact that a few Party organizations have relaxed ideological work, organizational discipline is lax, and there is a lack of supervision over Party members. Therefore, Party organizations should take this issue seriously and solemnly in the rectification, educate some Party members who lack energy to improve their communist consciousness, boost their spirits, and muster their energy; those who have lost their energy, lost their revolutionary will, and do not play the role of a Communist Party member, and who still do not correct themselves after criticism and education, should be persuaded to withdraw from the Party or be purged from the Party in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee.

Twelve years ago, Chairman Mao Zedong, at the Seventh National Congress of the Party, called on the entire Party to raise its awareness, make up its mind, not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and lead the people of the whole country, with the spirit of the foolish old man who removed the mountain, to strive for the victory of the democratic revolution. Our Party did this and won the victory of the people's democratic revolution. Under the current new situation in our country, the call of the Party Central Committee to "be energetic" will surely enhance the entire Party's fighting will and confidence in victory a hundredfold, and lead the people of the whole country to victoriously realize the great historical task of building our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, agriculture, and science and culture with the spirit of not fearing any difficulties and overcoming any difficulties with perseverance.

    共产党员一定要有朝气
    铁萍
    共产党员“一定要有朝气，一定要有革命的意志”，这是党的八届三中全会向共产党员提出的要求，同时也给党组织提出了一项极其重要的政治思想教育任务。
    目前，在我国从南方到北方，从工业建设的基地到偏僻的山村、原野，到处形成了声势壮阔、规模宏大的社会主义革命和生产建设的高潮。几十万干部走上体力劳动的岗位，以百万计的批评建议在被采纳，成亿农民热火朝天地兴修水利，……一片革命和建设大跃进的景象，真是使严冬失色，遍地充满了青春的活力。这一切，令人信服地说明，领导我国人民进行社会主义建设的共产党人，是充满了“让高山低头，河水让路”的英雄气概的，是充满了朝气蓬勃和坚韧不拔的革命毅力的。只有我们党才能向全国人民发出震动世界的进军号召——在十五年左右，我国在钢铁和其它重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国！也只有在我们党的领导下，中国人民才能以排山倒海的力量来实现这个历史上罕见的创举。
    我们党的绝大多数党员是朝气勃勃的，他们不愧为一切前进事业的促进派。但是，我们还要看到，在我们的队伍里，也有一小部分人是朝气不足的。他们在工作中满足现状，因循守旧，对新鲜事物缺乏敏感；在工作中遇到困难，自己不动脑筋，也看不到或不去总结群众的创造；热火朝天的全民整风运动，在他们的脑子里引不起波澜，依然故我，没有旺盛的革命感情，充满了政治上的庸人气息。
    特别值得注意的是，有极少数的党员，完全丧失了革命意志，只是孜孜不倦地追求个人名誉、地位和生活上的享受，斤斤计较个人得失，根本不学习理论，对政治斗争厌倦，对党的政治任务漠不关心，不钻研业务，对工作只是敷衍鬼混，“当一天和尚撞一天钟”，有的甚至几年不过组织生活，或根本不工作。他们不说自己变质、忘本，反而成天埋怨党“不重用”他。在他们看来，生活的理想，人生的目的，就是爱人、孩子和优裕的物质生活。他们之所以还愿意当“党员”，只是怕丢了“党票”，而影响自己的“饭票”或“官职”，实际上他们的思想和行动早和共产主义背道而驰了。
    是不是因为这些人年纪大了，由于生理上的衰退而落后了？不是，完全不是这样。在我们党内，绝大多数老党员，虽然在长期艰苦的斗争中，受尽折磨，体弱多病，但是他们干起工作来，却永远使你感到的是奔放的革命热情，对前途的无限信心。而那些革命意志衰退的人，却大都是身强力壮。他们害的是政治衰退症。
    如果我们仔细地分析一下某些丧失革命意志的人的情况，就可以发现，这些人中间的不少人，在过去革命战争中曾经有过一定的贡献。但他们是小资产阶级革命家，而不是无产阶级革命家。在无产阶级看来，夺取政权、完成民主革命，仅仅是革命的开始，更艰巨、更伟大的任务还在后面。但那些革命意志衰退的人却认为革命“完成”了，应当是“论功行赏”“坐享清福”的时候了。他们没有继续进行社会主义革命的思想准备，反而接受了资产阶级的影响，因之随着民主革命的胜利，他们的革命积极性也就结束了。这一点，在我国实行了农业合作化后，在某些党员的思想变化上看得最为明显。也有一些原来是剥削阶级出身、入党后又没有经过思想改造的人，他们的个人名利孽根很深，一味追求个人的名利地位，当这种思想和行为受到抑制后，就“失意”起来，整天萎靡不振，无精打采，对革命事业的一切都感到索然无味。什么党的事业，人民的利益，对于他们都是空话，他们只想着“今朝有酒今朝醉”。这种思想行为，充分反映了地主资产阶级没落绝望的颓败情绪。还有一些人，在入党时就缺乏共产主义觉悟，而随着大流入了党；他们可以做社会上的好公民，但是不能充当无产阶级先锋队的成员。
    由上所述，我们决不能把某些党员朝气不足或丧失革命意志的现象，看成是偶然的。这是社会上阶级关系变动在我们党员思想和行动上的反映。一些党员受了资产阶级的影响，在思想上发霉了甚至变质了，被远远地抛到了时代的后面，或反映了行将退出历史舞台的剥削阶级的没落情绪。虽然，完全丧失革命意志的人是极其少数的，但是，也有部分党员，或多或少沾染了这种灰尘，因而朝气不足。这种朝气不足的现象，是同实现党的历史任务的要求相反的。因此，“一定要有朝气”的号召，对全体党员来说，是有极其严重的意义的。
    革命的朝气和坚强的革命意志，是从无产阶级立场出发的对待革命事业的态度，是无产阶级党性的表现。无产阶级担负着改造社会、改造世界的伟大历史任务，这一任务要求它同时也决定了它的本性是永远富有蓬勃的朝气、做前进事业的促进派，而不能停滞不前的。共产党员要保持朝气，就必须坚定地树立共产主义人生观，做无产阶级的革命家，而不做半截革命家；就必须严肃地同一切非无产阶级的思想划清界限，全心全意为人民服务，而不是三心二意，更不能无心无意。也只有在这样的基础上，才能有真正持久的朝气，顽强的革命意志；也只有朝气勃勃的共产党员，才能充当社会主义的“带头人”，带领群众前进。暮气沉沉，消极疲蹋，是和共产党员的党性不相容的。
    一切朝气不足的人的共同特点，是脱离群众、脱离实际。“流水不腐，户枢不蠹”，任何人只生活在一个小圈子里，脱离群众的革命斗争和生产的实践，固步自封，就不能避免自己在思想上沾染各种政治灰尘和政治微生物。共产党员要想在思想上不发霉，不沾染暮气，就必须经常地深入群众，在革命斗争的洪炉里洗练自己，打开小圈子，接触新鲜空气，使自己的脚步和时代合拍，永远站在运动的前列。一些革命意志衰退的人，党组织除了对他们加强政治思想教育之外，应该指导他们到生产中去，到劳动中去，群众运动的烈火，是驱除霉气和暮气的良剂。
    朝气不足的人，还有一个特点，就是他们害了政治上的近视病，革命胜利后的较好的生活条件没有成为工作的有利条件，反而成了囚禁他们革命意志的牢笼，个人得失的考虑超过了革命的利益，物欲迷惑了革命的良知，使他们丧失了前进心，畏惧劳苦，贪图安逸。资产阶级个人主义是万恶的根源。要有朝气，就一定要去掉个人主义，不要有私心，不要做狭隘的个人物质生活的囚徒，而坚定地做具有崇高远大理想的革命战士。要经常关心政治，开阔自己的精神世界，在政治上向前看，做生活的主人，而不要向后看，成为生活的俘虏。要孜孜不倦地学习，永不自满，经常对新鲜事物保持锐敏的感觉。
    最后，某些党员革命意志衰退或缺乏朝气的现象，是同少数党组织放松思想工作，组织纪律松懈，对党员缺乏监督分不开的。因此，党组织应在整风中认真严肃地对待这个问题，对某些朝气不足的党员进行教育，使他们提高共产主义觉悟，振作精神，鼓起干劲；对丧失朝气、丧失革命意志、不起共产党员作用、经过批评教育仍不改正的人，应按照中央指示，劝他们退党或者清洗他们出党。
    在十二年前，毛泽东主席在党的七次代表大会上，曾号召全党提高觉悟，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，带领全国人民，以愚公移山的精神，争取民主革命的胜利。我们党这样做了，赢得了人民民主革命的胜利。在我国目前的新形势下，党中央“一定要有朝气”的号召，也一定能百倍地增强全党的斗争意志和胜利信心，以不怕任何困难和百折不挠地克服任何困难的精神，领导全国人民胜利地实现把我国建成一个具有现代化工业、农业和科学文化的社会主义强国的伟大历史任务。
