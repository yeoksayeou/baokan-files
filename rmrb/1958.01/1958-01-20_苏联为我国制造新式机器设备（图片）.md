    Soviet Union Manufactures New Machinery and Equipment for China
    For more than eight years, the Soviet Union has supplied China with a large number of new machinery and equipment. Among the 156 industrial enterprises that form the backbone of China's industrial construction, 50% to 70% of all major machinery and equipment are supplied by the Soviet Union. These machinery and equipment are the newest and top-notch, and some have not even been used in the Soviet Union. In the factories undertaking the manufacture of machinery and equipment for China, Soviet workers are enthusiastically completing their tasks quickly and well.

    苏联为我国制造新式机器设备
    八年多来，苏联供给了我国大批新式机器设备。在构成我国工业建设骨干的一百五十六项工业企业中，全部主要机器设备的50％至70％都是苏联供应的。这些机器设备都是最新式的、头等的，有些甚至在苏联还没有用过。在承担为我国制造机器设备的工厂中，苏联工人都热情地又快又好地完成任务。图为苏联列宁格勒“柴油机”制造厂正在为我国制造内燃发动机。　塔斯社传真照片（新华社发）
