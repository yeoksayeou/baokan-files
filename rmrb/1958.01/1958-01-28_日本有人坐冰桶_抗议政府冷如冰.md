Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th— Braving the winter cold, a 46-year-old Japanese man, Goichiro Fujimoto, sat naked in an oil drum filled with ice blocks in front of the Tokyo Diet Building on the 25th, to express his protest against the Japanese government. He said that Japanese politics are as cold as ice.

    Fujimoto placed placards next to the oil drum, demanding amendments to the election law to establish an "enlightened" government, relief for war victims, and the abolition of pensions for former soldiers.

    Fujimoto sat in the bucket containing five 35-pound blocks of ice for approximately 50 minutes.

    日本有人坐冰桶
    抗议政府冷如冰
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：不顾冬季的严寒，一个四十六岁的日本人藤本五一郎25日在东京国会大厦的前面光着身子坐在装满冰块的石油桶里，表示对日本政府的抗议。他说，日本的政治像冰一样的冷。
    藤本在石油桶的旁边安置了标语牌，要求修改选举法以便建立“开明”的政府，救济战争的受害者和取消给以前的军人的年金。
    藤本在盛着五块三十五磅重的冰块的桶子里坐了大约五十分钟。
