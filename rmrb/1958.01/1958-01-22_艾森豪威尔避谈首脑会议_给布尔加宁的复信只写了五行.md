Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 21st. White House announced on the 21st that U.S. President Eisenhower's reply to Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin's second letter was released. The letter was extremely simple, only five lines long. The letter emphasized that his first reply to Bulganin on January 12 "already touched on the substantive issues," and whether to reply to Bulganin's second letter would be decided "after further study" of that letter.

According to White House Press Secretary Hagerty, Eisenhower's reply indicates that the United States will not respond to Bulganin's second letter.

Bulganin's second letter suggested that heads of government meet in the next two or three months. Although Eisenhower, under pressure from world public opinion, did not dare to completely close the door to a summit meeting in his first reply, he put forward various unreasonable conditions for holding such a meeting.

### 艾森豪威尔避谈首脑会议  给布尔加宁的复信只写了五行

    艾森豪威尔避谈首脑会议
    给布尔加宁的复信只写了五行
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：白宫21日公布了美国总统艾森豪威尔给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁第二封信的复信。这封信写得极其简单，一共只有五行。信里强调说，他在1月12日给布尔加宁的第一封复信“已经谈到了实质问题”，对布尔加宁的第二封信是否作答复，需要在对那封信“作进一步研究之后”再决定。
    据白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂说，艾森豪威尔这封复信是要表明，美国不会再对布尔加宁的第二封信作答复。
    布尔加宁的第二封信是建议各国政府首脑在今后两三个月内举行会议。艾森豪威尔在他的第一封复信里虽然迫于世界舆论，没有敢关死举行最高级会议的大门，但是，他却为举行这样一个会议提出了种种无理条件。
