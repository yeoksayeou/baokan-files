    They Are Fulfilling Their Promises
    The cadres from the Communist Youth League of Jilin Province who were sent to the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative in Changxing Township, Panshi County, made a guarantee to the Party before leaving their offices: they were determined to temper and transform themselves through labor in the countryside; to shed their airs and humbly learn the excellent qualities of hard work and frugality from the peasants; to overcome all difficulties and strive to be good cooperative members. More than a month of actual labor has proven that they are working hard to fulfill the guarantees they made to the Party.

    After working in the fields threshing rice, winnowing grain, and carrying earth, Leng Wenbin, an office worker from the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, now feels energized in everything he does. The peasants affectionately praise him as a "capable young man." Leng Wenbin worked even harder when the cooperative repaired the reservoir. He used the heat generated by his labor to overcome the harsh winter.

   Early in the morning, just as the sky was beginning to dawn, Chen Xingbang (first from right), deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Leng Wenbin (first from left), an office worker, went to the yard with cooperative member Uncle Yang to shovel snow.

    他们在实现自己的诺言
    共青团吉林省委员会下放到盘石县长兴乡幸福农业社的干部，在离开机关前，曾向党提出保证：决心到农村劳动锻炼改造自己；放下架子，虚心学习农民勤劳俭朴的优良品质；克服一切困难，争取做个好社员。一个多月的实际劳动，证明他们正为实现他们向党提出的保证而努力着。

    共青团吉林省委办公室干事冷文彬到农村后，经过打稻、扬场、挑土等劳动后，现在干什么都得劲了。农民们亲切地称赞他是“能干的小伙子”。社里修补水库时冷文彬干得更欢了。他用劳动发出的热战胜了严寒的冬天。
    老社员杨有才（右）在帮助新社员冷文彬（左）穿靰鞡鞋。穿上这样的鞋在冰天雪地里干活就不会冻脚了。
   早晨，天刚蒙蒙亮，共青团吉林省委宣传部副部长陈兴邦（右一）、办公室干事冷文彬（左一），便和社员杨大叔一块到院子里铲雪。
