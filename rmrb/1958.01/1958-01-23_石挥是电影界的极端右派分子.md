    Shi Hui is an extreme rightist in the film industry. His opposition to the Party is consistent. As far back as when Shanghai was an isolated island, Shi Hui incited people to leave the Shanghai Drama Art Society, a theatrical troupe led by the Party at the time, undermining the drama movement. Since liberation, Shi Hui has used every opportunity, from telling jokes and performing comic dialogues to writing articles and making movies, to slander, satirize, and curse the Party, oppose the Party's policies and its literary and artistic line. During the period of "blooming and contending," he felt that the time for "overturning" had come, and he rampantly published various anti-Party and anti-socialist speeches and articles, spewing out the venom accumulated in his chest.
    Shi Hui was engaged in film work, so his anti-Party face was exposed most clearly and thoroughly on film issues. It can be said that from the direction of film creation to the organizational form of film production, he held a hostile attitude toward the Party in every aspect. Shi Hui consistently attacked, satirized, and slandered the correct line put forward by the Party, and also consistently touted and promoted his decadent bourgeois artistic creation ideas and the declining capitalist film path. He attempted and actively planned to organize a group that he could manipulate and control to usurp the Party's leadership, in order to realize his old dream of being a feudal "emperor" style boss.
    Shi Hui's first step in opposing the Party in the film industry was to slander and uglify the leadership, and to provoke the relationship between the masses and the Party and the leadership. He described the leadership of the film industry as laymen, saying, "I'm not afraid of laymen leading, but I'm afraid of laymen pretending to be experts!" In this way, the leadership has no say in creation, otherwise, it will inevitably be pretending to be an "expert"! In this way, not only comrades transferred from other revolutionary posts cannot lead the film industry because they are "laymen"; but also comrades drawn from the ranks of film creators cannot lead, because in Shi Hui's view, these comrades are just "laymen" pretending to be "experts"!
    Shi Hui completely obliterated the achievements of the film industry in the years since liberation. He turned a blind eye to the audience figures reaching 1.6 billion, insisting that "the films we talk about in the factory that have strong ideological content and are well-made are just not watched by anyone once they are released!" He prevented people from talking about the achievements of the film industry at seminars, and used comic dialogues on various occasions to satirize the phrase "achievements are the main thing." When someone pointed out that a certain film with strong ideological content, which everyone thought was good, was indeed welcomed by the masses and the audience was very enthusiastic, he said in a slanderous tone: "It's weird! The Communist Youth League has really played a role!" This is precisely Shi Hui's usual trick of killing two birds with one stone, lightly denying the fact that the audience turnout was enthusiastic, and also incidentally slandering the Communist Youth League.
    Shi Hui also seized every opportunity, whether in the studio, on the sidewalk, or in the restaurant, to slander the Party's leadership in the form of telling jokes and performing comic dialogues, putting white powder on their noses, trying to make some people unknowingly fall for his trick of uglifying the leadership amidst laughter, and gradually accept his view that the leadership is a group of mediocre and obsequious people.
    On this basis, Shi Hui further provoked, trying to pit some creative cadres against the Party, opposing the Party's leadership over the film industry, in order to achieve his goal of usurping leadership.
    When he and other right-wing elements echoed each other in opposing the Party's leadership over film creation, Shi Hui feigned humility but actually provoked by saying, "Many people make literary reports on stage about 'starting from the characters' and paying attention to rhythm. Such reports are okay for people of my age to listen to, and it's beneficial, but it seems inconsiderate to many seniors present!" Again, that trick of killing two birds with one stone! With a light sentence, he not only denied the fact that the vast majority of creative cadres benefited from the study of creative issues, but also released a provocative venom on many more experienced creative personnel.
    When he, like other right-wing elements, opposed the planned nature of film production, he more thoroughly opposed today's film production system. He not only believed that the requirements of good, fast, and economical hindered "creative freedom," and not only fabricated that the director "has to accept any kind of film directing task" and "doesn't even know what the task is until the last minute," thus "the director loses initiative," but also went to great lengths to provoke by saying: "Some problems are simply satirical comedies: many old directors have become laymen. The new rules in the studio make old directors who haven't been in the studio for a long time feel at a loss!" (See Shi Hui's "Pay Attention to the Tradition of Chinese Film" in the Wenhui Daily on December 3, 1956)
    In fact, socialist film production is an important department of socialist cultural propaganda and a part of the socialist planned economy. Its production method and system are naturally different from the blind and commercialized production method and system of capitalism. It is not surprising that old directors who have not made films for a long time feel somewhat unfamiliar when they enter the studio. Although this new system is not perfect and even has many shortcomings that should be improved, it is basically correct, and practice in recent years has shown that it has played a great role. However, Shi Hui wanted to completely deny the new production system and tried to use this to provoke some old directors, some creative cadres who had been engaged in film work before liberation. It should be pointed out that Shi Hui was the first to publicly propose the saying that "tradition is people." When right-wing elements in the film industry were loudly clamoring that the Party did not pay attention to the tradition of film, Shi Hui was the first to propose in an article: "Since the past of Chinese film is not mentioned after liberation, therefore, film workers who have lived in the old society are not valued. Some people have complex social relations, can we trust them and let them go ahead and do it?..." (See the article "Pay Attention to the Tradition of Chinese Film") In this way, Shi Hui not only dragged the question of views on tradition into the question of views on people, but also distorted the fact that in previous years, a few people were not suitable for making films reflecting the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers due to their life limitations, into political discrimination! Not only that, Shi Hui also spread a rumor in the film circle, saying that there are three different levels of people in the film industry: one is from Yan'an, one is from Chongqing, and one has always been in Shanghai. Disregarding the fact that comrades such as Zuo Lin, Sang Hu, and Ke Ling, these writers and directors who have always been in Shanghai, and comrades such as Zhang Fa, Bai Mu, and Wang Danfeng, these actors who have always been in Shanghai (and should also include Shi Hui himself) have been highly valued, he fabricated rumors saying that "Shanghainese are the least popular" and "now it's time to turn over!" This is how Shi Hui viciously provoked discord among film workers, trying to incite the dissatisfaction of some people, to undermine the unity of the film industry, and to oppose the Party's leadership over the film industry.
    Shi Hui's attempt is very obvious: he wants to uglify the Party and the leadership of the film industry into a group of people who are not only mediocre and incompetent laymen, but also tyrannical people riding on the heads of creative personnel. He wants people to be bewitched by him, believing that these leaders not only do not understand film and ruin the film industry, but also restrain experts, hindering the "initiative" of experts like Shi Hui, and not allowing them to do a good job in the film industry! So, what else can be done with such leadership except to oppose it? How can the film industry be done well if it is not done by "experts" like Shi Hui? This is the conclusion that Shi Hui wants people who are bewitched by him to draw themselves, using his tricks of "feinting east and attacking west" and "a lucky punch."
    In the first few years of liberation, in order to quickly resist the pornographic films of Hollywood, in order to immediately transform the film industry into a socialist cause, and in response to the urgent demands of film workers for learning and transformation, it was necessary to have centralized management of film. Due to a lack of experience, this centralization had some aspects that exceeded what was necessary, and in recent years, there have also been decentralization measures that have not been sufficiently combined with reality and have been gradually and timely decentralized. In terms of creative leadership, there have also been some individual tendencies of dogmatism. We do not deny these shortcomings, and it is precisely in response to these shortcomings that the leadership of the film industry has proactively raised issues, asked everyone to discuss them, and actively proposed measures such as decentralized factories, in order to implement the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend in the film industry. At this time, Shi Hui, like other right-wing elements who made miscalculations, believed that the time to win leadership had matured, and while writing articles, he also launched a large-scale attack at various seminars, questioning whether the leadership of the film industry "is willing to let go, dare to let go"? He slapped the table and shouted at the meeting, "Release whatever you want to release!" Not only did he say it, but Shi Hui also took concrete action by taking advantage of the opportunity to organize a creative cooperative. He used despicable means such as inviting people to eat and drink, promising high rewards, etc., to win over people and prepare to organize a group that he could command and control, and proposed to the leaders of the Shanghai Film Studio the capitalist production method of the old society of "contracting five films a year." Of course, Shi Hui resolutely excluded Party members and refused to allow creative personnel close to the Party to participate in the group he organized. Of course, the leadership was not allowed to interfere with the films that he "contracted."
    Yes, like many right-wing elements, Shi Hui said that the leadership can nod or shake their heads on political matters, but has no right to interfere in artistic treatment. But in concrete works, can political thought be completely separated from artistic treatment? Can a script, as long as it does not make political or policy errors in the text, guarantee that it will not be distorted or cause problems in the treatment? Not only are we very clear that this is not possible, but Shi Hui understands this even better than anyone else. Taking his most recent film, "Night Voyage in the Fog Sea," as an example, judging from the literary script printed on paper, it can be said that there are basically no serious political errors. However, in the directing process, through his "artistic treatment," Shi Hui exhausted his ability to distort the images of workers, peasants, and the People's Liberation Army. He treated the positive characters almost without exception as hysterics, he peddled a large number of bourgeois gimmicks and tastes, and he vigorously praised the "capable" individual heroism - the captain who insisted on mistakes, even at the cost of hinting that the ship ran aground due to the need to complete the state task plan. Did Shi Hui not have a well-thought-out plan for controlling everything through "artistic treatment"? Obviously, what Shi Hui meant by "the leadership nods politically, but does not interfere in art" is just to have the leadership take political responsibility for him, write him a guarantee, and then let him do whatever he wants to sell his own private goods!
    Therefore, Shi Hui is not only trying to divide the court with the Party, asking the Party to only take care of politics and he takes care of art, but is also trying to actually usurp the Party's leadership over creation and create a group that only listens to his orders. In some moments, didn't he indeed reveal this idea involuntarily? He raised objections to "Deep Affection and Friendship" in the creative cooperative, and tried his best to portray the scientist Huang Weiwen, who had bourgeois ideas, as a "capable person" who cannot be criticized, and portrayed Hong Leiguang, the Party committee secretary sent to the Institute of Microbiology who had been to Yan'an, as mediocre and incompetent, relying on Huang for everything. When the original author and director expressed hesitation, pointing out that the script was approved by the leadership and it would be inappropriate to make such changes, Shi Hui lost his temper and shouted: "What if they approved it? We can't shoot if we don't approve it!" In Shi Hui's mind, who should lead the creation is very clear, isn't it? Despite the various smokescreens released by Shi Hui, saying that the "cooperative" of the creative collective should be responsible by the collective members in turn, and that he was unwilling to be a fixed president, his real intention could not be concealed. In his "My Views on 'Who is the Center'" (see the first issue of Popular Cinema in 1957), wasn't it said very explicitly? He said: "Who is the center of the creative relationship should be decided according to the specific situation." What is the specific situation? He said, "If there is a person who has the talent of Chaplin, the ability to integrate production, writing, directing, acting, art... it is not impossible to let him be the center." This person who integrates writing, directing, and acting is of course no one else but Shi Hui himself. Just as the representative of tradition that he referred to that was not valued is also no one else but himself, the "Shanghainese" who he said should turn over is also no one else but himself. To sum it up in one sentence: Shi Hui has never forgotten his feudal boss-style "emperor" dream before liberation, he does not want to be a leader of a creative collective who is responsible to the Party and the leadership, he wants to be the behind-the-scenes figure of a group commanded and manipulated by him!
    Facts show that he is already manipulating this collective, influencing many young writers and directors, and injecting his venom into their works. For example, "Deep Affection and Friendship" praised bourgeois friendship prominently under his interference; for example, "Woman Basketball Player No. 5" abandoned its theme idea to pursue the plot of joys and sorrows under his advocacy. He wanted a young screenwriter to describe today's society as very dark in a script about children's issues, and insisted on writing a scene where a Yue opera actress tied her child to the leg of a backstage table while performing on stage. Under the guise of not making thriller-style films, he insisted that the creative collective should not make anti-spy films!
    Look at what kind of program Shi Hui proposed within the collective. He openly flaunted that his collective would not engage in major themes, but only write about daily life; he openly said that films should not care about themes, as long as the plot is tortuous and the audience likes to watch it. May I ask, isn't this a replica of Hu Feng's notorious theory of "life is everywhere"? Isn't this resisting the Party's policy of literary and artistic reflection of the current major struggle, and literary and artistic expression of the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers? If you don't write about major themes, don't reflect the lives and struggles of workers and peasants, and don't want ideological content, what do you want? What Shi Hui proposed was "taste" and "a sense of life and human touch." In the short narrative of "Night Voyage in the Fog Sea," he boasted that this was his goal. It is precisely the sample film produced by this film that specifically and clearly shows what kind of sense of life he is talking about, and what kind of human touch he is talking about. Under his depiction, workers, peasants, and the People's Liberation Army have become people who only know their boxes and baskets, people who are sex maniacs, people who are hysterical, and people who are pessimistic and desperate! He forcibly imposed the "sense of life" of the selfish petty bourgeoisie on the heads of workers, peasants, and soldiers. What he calls "human touch" is nothing more than vulgar gimmicks of bourgeois taste.
    Of course, Shi Hui's kind of gimmick-ism that opposes ideological content also has its own theoretical basis. Like other right-wing elements, Shi Hui slandered that ideological content drove away the audience and emphasized box office value. Only he went a step further, he openly proposed the philistine idea of "whoever's film makes money gets more remuneration"! Therefore, Shi Hui not only opposes film serving the broad masses of workers and peasants and serving the great cause of socialism, but also shamelessly uses more money as a call, trying to lure some creative personnel to follow his anti-Party and anti-socialist literary and artistic line, and use film as a tool to cater to the tastes of a few people and satisfy his personal desires for fame and wealth and his ambition.
    In the spirit of the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, it has been proposed in the film industry that the restriction of themes should not be too strict, and that writers should be encouraged and guided according to their level, and it has also been proposed to respect various styles and genres. But Shi Hui's attempt to exploit loopholes here is futile. Because no one has said that the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers can be abandoned, no one has said that concessions can be made to vulgar bourgeois tastes, and no one has said that the purpose of literary and artistic creation can be reduced to pursuing "a few more rewards." Such literature and art will inevitably not be beneficial but harmful to socialism. We cannot engage in socialist construction on the one hand and allow creative workers to take such a corrupt bourgeois literary and artistic line on the other!
    In fact, Shi Hui is not really opposed to works having ideological content. In the end, he is only trying to deceive some people, to make people violate the Party's literary and artistic policy, and abandon the ideological content of Marxism-Leninism. As for Shi Hui himself, in his creations, especially in his comic dialogues, it is not that there is no ideological content (of course, it can only be reactionary ideological content). On the contrary, his ideological content is unambiguous and very firm.
    As mentioned earlier, Shi Hui tells comic dialogues everywhere, satirizing and slandering the Communist Party, socialism, and everything in the new society, using the "accidental hit" of laughter and jokes to "hit" everything new that he hates. This must not be regarded as Shi Hui's natural talent for telling jokes, or his "style." Why did he never reveal this "natural talent" or use this "style" to ridicule the reactionary rule and dark forces before liberation? This cannot be explained by Shi Hui being timid and afraid of being persecuted by the reactionaries, because he did not even harshly ridicule the speculators, black marketeers, and rice weevils who were criticized by everyone in the newspapers and verbally at the time as he does today. Of course, in movies, Shi Hui cannot be as explicit as he is in comic dialogues. Movies have the supervision of thousands of viewers and the censorship of the leadership, so Shi Hui has to "speak in a roundabout way" and secretly transport his private goods. However, his ideological position is still unconcealable with a little attention to analysis. Isn't the ideological content of "Company Commander Guan" clear enough? Isn't the ideological content of "Night Voyage in the Fog Sea" clear enough? In the latter film, although Shi Hui superficially pretends to praise the new society and praise the People's Liberation Army, in fact, he praises the captain who insists on mistakes—a "capable person" like Shi Hui himself—criticizes the national task plan, and distorts the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers. What does Shi Hui love, hate, support, and oppose? It is very clear.
    Here, it is necessary to specifically mention Shi Hui's sinful bewitching of young actors. Shi Hui once publicly promoted his philosophy of "rolling" to some young actors. We know that Shi Hui opposes all kinds of learning, from reading books and newspapers to creative conferences, which he satirizes as things that hinder the "artistic life" of directors and actors. At a symposium for young actors convened by the Shanghai Youth Daily, he openly incited: "The actor's profession is acting, and should not engage in other things!" When actors newly joining the Shanghai Film Studio asked Shi Hui what guides to read, he replied: "As long as you act in two more plays, reading those books will only do harm and no good!" Shi Hui opposes not only political study, but also professional theoretical study, and even opposes going deep into life and integrating with workers and peasants to transform his thinking. Today's call by the Party to go to the mountains and the countryside to work and exercise is of course absurd in Shi Hui's view. Because according to Shi Hui, an actor only needs to "roll" on the stage for two years like him, Shi Hui, to "roll out." He openly said to actresses newly joining film work: "As long as you follow me, I guarantee you will be popular within two years!" Therefore, whether an actor can succeed depends only on whether he can get Shi Hui's promotion, and the in-depth life transformation of thinking and improving one's political, life, and professional level that the Party loudly calls for are not only unnecessary, but only "waste the youth of actors," making them "accumulated talents."
    Yes, we also emphasize professional practice, and we do not oppose experienced old actors cultivating newcomers in the way of mentoring. But it is not difficult to see that Shi Hui's method of "rolling" has nothing in common with the professional practice based on life and guided by theory that we advocate. Shi Hui's purpose in promoting his philosophy of "rolling" is to bewitch a group of young actors from petty-bourgeois backgrounds, to make them Shi Hui's worshipers, and to resist the Party's demand that artistic workers transform their thoughts and feelings, and change their outlook on life and the world. There is no need to go deep into life, no need to integrate with workers and peasants, no need to study political theory, no need to go through a long and arduous process of learning and transformation, as long as you act in two more plays, "roll" him for two years, learn some tricks to "control the audience," you can eat endlessly, and you can "guarantee popularity" - imagine, isn't this a very tempting "shortcut" for some young actors from petty-bourgeois backgrounds to hear?
    We must expose Shi Hui's conspiracy and awaken the young actors who have been bewitched by Shi Hui. First of all, it should be pointed out that Shi Hui's set of "rolling" philosophies will not work. The result of his own adherence to the philosophy of "rolling" and resisting transformation is the best illustration. His set of "tricks" and "techniques", without the supervision and help of the Party, can only produce films like "Company Commander Guan" and "Night Voyage in the Fog Sea", can only distort the images of new characters, and can only produce poisonous weeds; his persistence in the bourgeois position can only lead himself to the reactionary path of right-wing elements! It must also be pointed out that Shi Hui's real purpose in bewitching young actors with the philosophy of "rolling" is to create a group of "rabble" who are willing to follow him, worship him, be used by him, and blindly carry out his corrupt and reactionary creative intentions.
    Shi Hui opposes learning, opposes transformation, opposes artistic discussion, and opposes emphasizing the theme idea of ​​works. The ultimate goal of this consistent action is very clear. He hopes that actors will always be actors who are politically confused, ideologically backward, and willingly manipulated by him, writers and directors will always be writers and directors who can allow him to inject venom into their works, in other words, all become his tools that can be used to distort the new society and oppose the Party and the people! This is the most vicious part of Shi Hui!
    Therefore, Shi Hui not only insists on a line that is opposed to the Party on the artistic line, promotes box office value, and opposes reflecting the lives and struggles of workers and peasants, not only attempts to sell his bourgeois private goods under the disguised "art for art's sake" and under the guise of emphasizing "a sense of life and human touch", but also consciously confuses young people, incites creative personnel, and attempts to organize a collective that he can manipulate and use, in order to achieve his goal of becoming an isolated and widowed ruler and becoming a base and tool for him to oppose the Party and oppose socialism!
    Shi Hui's anti-Party, anti-socialist, and hatred of the new society are inseparable from his reactionary class position. Starting from his landlord class position and from his despicable personal desires, he naturally feels that "the present is not as good as the past", and naturally feels that the old society was everywhere beneficial to him, and the new society is everywhere unfavorable to him.
    After liberation, the Party and the people gave Shi Hui a lot of things: they gave him various honors, gave him the treatment of senior intellectuals, the status of municipal people's representative, gave him priority opportunities to make films, and specifically helped him to make better films such as "Chicken Feather Letter" and "The Fairy Couple"; but he thought it was a waste of him, thought it was restricting his freedom, he not only did not appreciate it, but hated the Party, hated the new society, the reason is that the things he values ​​and needs, the Party and the new society cannot satisfy him. The Party and the new society cannot allow him to speculate and exploit others and oppress others in the style of a gang boss as he did before liberation, cannot allow him to arbitrarily play with women and insult women, cannot allow his secret agent brother to be at large, and cannot allow him to restore his landlord family of one of the eight major families of Yangliuqing, so he resolutely ends up being an enemy of the people!
    Some people regret Shi Hui's talent. Yes, Shi Hui may have a certain talent, but this is not the time to discuss whether Shi Hui has talent or how much talent he has, because he is opposing the Party and opposing socialism, he is using his talent to oppose the Party and oppose the people, we don't need such talent. The greater this talent, the more unfavorable it will be to us.

    石挥是电影界的极端右派分子
    张骏祥
    石挥是电影界的极端右派分子。他反党是有一贯性的。远在上海沦为孤岛的时期，石挥就煽动人脱离当时党领导的剧团上海剧艺社，破坏剧运。解放以来，石挥随时随地，从讲笑话、说相声到写文章、拍电影，不放弃任何机会，千方百计地诬蔑、讽刺和咒骂党，反对党的政策和党的文艺路线。在鸣放期中，他更认为“翻身”的时机已到，猖狂地发表各种反党反社会主义的言论和文章，喷吐出蕴蓄在他胸中的毒液。
    石挥是从事电影工作的，因此在电影问题上他的反党的面目也暴露得最清楚彻底。可以说，从电影的创作方向到电影的生产制度组织形式，没有一样他不是和党抱敌对的态度的。石挥一贯地打击、讽刺、诬蔑党所提出的正确的路线，也同样一贯地吹嘘和推销他的腐朽透顶的资产阶级艺术创作思想和没落的资本主义电影道路。他企图并且积极筹划组织自己可以操纵左右的集团，篡夺党的领导权，以便实现他那个做封建把头式的“皇帝”的旧梦。
    石挥在电影界反党的第一个步骤，是诬蔑和丑化领导，挑拨群众与党和领导的关系。他把电影事业的领导说成是外行，他说：“不怕领导外行，就怕领导假充内行！”这样一来，领导对创作就没有了发言权，否则就不免是假充“内行”！这样一来，不仅一些从其他革命岗位上调来的同志不能领导电影，因为他们是“外行”；而且就是从电影创作人员行列中抽调来的同志也不能领导，因为在石挥看来，这些同志不过是硬充“内行”的“外行”！
    石挥一笔抹煞了解放几年来电影事业的成绩。他不看年达十六亿人次的观众数字，硬说“我们在厂里谈来谈去思想性强、拍得好的影片，可就是出了门没人看！”他在座谈会上阻止人家谈电影事业的成绩，在各种场合说相声，对“成绩是主要的”这句话加以讽刺。当有人指出某部思想性较强、大家认为好的影片确是受到群众的欢迎，观众很踊跃的时候，他就以诬蔑的口吻说：“邪乎！青年团倒是真起了作用！”这正是石挥常用的一石二鸟的惯技，轻轻一句，既否定了观众上座踊跃的事实，又顺带着诬蔑了青年团。
    石挥还随时随地，不论是在摄影棚里，是在人行道上，是在饭馆里，总不放弃任何机会，用说笑话说相声的方式诬蔑党的领导，往他们的鼻子上涂白粉，企图使某些人在哈哈一笑之中，不知不觉地中了他丑化领导的诡计，逐渐地接受了他的看法：领导是一群庸庸碌碌唯唯诺诺的人。
    在这样的基础上，石挥再进一步进行挑拨，企图使某些创作干部和党对立起来，反对党对电影事业的领导，以达到他的篡夺领导权的目的。
    在他和其他右派分子此唱彼和地反对党对电影创作的领导的时候，石挥貌似谦虚实际上是挑拨地说：“许多人在台上做一些‘从人物出发’，注意节奏感之类的文艺性报告。这样的报告说给我这样年龄的人听，是没有什么不可以的，而且是有好处的，但对在座的许多前辈，似乎就欠考虑了！”又是那个一石二鸟的惯技！轻轻一句，既否定了事实上绝大多数创作干部都从而得到益处的创作问题的学习，又对许多较有经验的创作人员放出挑拨的毒液。
    在他像其他右派分子一样反对电影生产的计划性的时候，他更彻底地反对今天的电影生产制度。他不仅认为好、快、省的要求妨碍了“创作自由”，不仅捏造说是导演“要接受任何一种片种的导演任务”，并且“在前一分钟也不会知道”是什么任务，因此“导演丧失了主动性”，而且又极尽挑拨能事地说：“有些问题简直构成了讽刺喜剧：许多老导演变成了外行了。摄影场里的一套新规矩，使得许久没进摄影棚的老导演手足无措！”（见1956年12月3日文汇报石挥的“重视中国电影的传统”）
    其实，社会主义的电影生产是社会主义文化宣传事业的一个重要部门，又是社会主义计划经济的一部分，它从生产方式到生产制度自然不同于资本主义的盲目的商品化的生产方式与制度。久不拍戏的老导演走进摄影棚感到有些生疏，本来毫不足怪。这一套新的制度尽管还不够完善，甚至有很多缺点，应该改进，但是它基本上是正确的，几年来的实践也说明是起了很大作用的。但是石挥却想全盘否定新的生产制度，并且企图利用这一点来挑拨一些老导演，一些解放前就从事电影工作的创作干部。应该指出：石挥正是第一个公开提出“传统就是人”这种说法的。当电影界的右派分子敲锣打鼓叫嚣党不重视电影传统的时候，是石挥首先在文章里提出：“解放后，对中国电影的过去既然不谈起，因此，对从旧社会中生活过来的电影工作者也就不重视。有些人社会关系复杂，能信任他让他放手去做吗？……”（见“重视中国电影的传统”一文）这样，石挥不仅把对传统的看法问题扯成对人的看法的问题，而且挑拨离间地把前些年有少数人由于生活局限不适于拍反映工农兵生活的影片的事实歪曲为政治上的歧视！不仅如此，石挥还在电影圈内散布这样一种谣言，说电影界有三种不同等级的人：一种是延安来的，一种是重庆来的，一种是老在上海的。他不顾佐临、桑弧、柯灵等同志这些老在上海的编导，张伐、白穆、王丹凤等同志这些老在上海的演员（也应该包括石挥自己）受到重用的事实，硬造谣说“上海人最不吃香”，“现在应该翻翻身了”！石挥就是这样恶毒地在电影工作者当中挑拨离间，企图煽动起一部分人的不满情绪，来破坏电影界的团结，来反对党对电影事业的领导。
    石挥的企图十分明显：他要把党和电影事业的领导丑化成为一批不仅仅是庸碌无能的外行，而且是蛮横的骑在创作人员头上的人物。他要使人家受他的蛊惑，认为这些领导不但自己不懂电影，把电影事业搞坏了，而且束缚了内行们，妨碍了像石挥这样的内行的“主动性”，不许他们把电影事业搞好！那么，这样的领导除了反对掉还有什么办法呢？电影不叫像石挥这样的“内行”来搞怎么搞得好呢？这就是石挥施展他的“声东击西”、“歪打正着”的花招，想叫受他蛊惑的人自己得出的结论。
    在解放的头几年，为了迅速抵制好莱坞的黄色影片，为了把电影事业立即转变为社会主义的事业，为了电影工作者的迫切的学习与改造的要求，电影有集中管理的必要。由于缺乏经验，这种集中有某些超过必要的地方，近年来也有不够结合实际逐步地及时分散下放之处，在创作领导上，也有某些个别的教条主义的倾向。我们不否认这些缺点，也正是针对着这些缺点，电影事业的领导主动提出问题，要求大家讨论，并且积极提出分厂下放等措施，以求在电影事业中贯彻党所提出的百花齐放百家争鸣的方针。在这个时候，石挥正像其他估计错误的右派分子一样，认为争取领导权的时机已经成熟，一面写文章，一面在各种座谈会上大肆攻击，质问电影事业的领导“究竟肯不肯放手，敢不敢放手”？在会场上拍桌子高叫“要放什么都放！”不仅是说，石挥还利用组织创作合作社的机会，具体行动起来。他用请吃、请喝、答应给高酬等等卑劣手段拉拢人马，预备组织一个他可以指挥操纵的集团，并且向上影厂的领导提出“一年包拍五部戏”的旧社会的资本主义生产方式的办法。当然，石挥在他所组织的集团里，是坚决排斥党员，拒绝靠近党的创作人员参加的。当然，他所“包拍”的戏领导是不得过问的。
    是的，也像很多右派分子一样，石挥说过领导在政治上可以点头摇头，在艺术处理上就无权过问。但是在具体作品中，政治思想是否能和艺术处理截然分开呢？一个剧本，是否只要在文字上不犯政治政策上的错误，就可以保证在处理上不会造成歪曲，不出毛病呢？不但我们很清楚这是不行的，石挥更比任何人都明白这是不可能的事。以他最近编导的一部影片“雾海夜航”为例，从印在纸上的文学剧本来看，可以说基本上是没有什么严重的政治错误的。但是在导演过程中，通过他的“艺术处理”，石挥却极尽其歪曲工农和解放军形象之能事，他把正面人物几乎无例外地处理成为歇斯底里的，他大量贩卖资产阶级的噱头、趣味，他大力歌颂个人英雄主义的“能人”——坚持错误的船长，甚至不惜暗示会意地把船触礁归罪于必须完成国家任务计划。石挥对于通过“艺术处理”可以左右一切，难道不是胸有成竹的吗？很明显地，石挥所谓“领导政治上点头，艺术上不要管”，不过是要领导替他在政治上负责，替他写包票，然后由他为所欲为，去贩卖自己的私货！
    所以，石挥不仅仅是企图与党分庭抗礼，叫党只管政治，他管艺术，而是企图在实际上篡夺党对创作的领导权，搞一个唯他之命是听的集团。在某些时候，他不也的确情不自禁地流露出他这种想法了吗？他在创作合作社里对“情长谊深”提出意见，竭力主张把资产阶级思想的科学家黄蔚文写成“能人”，不能批评，把去过延安的党委派作微生物研究所所长的洪磊光写成庸碌无能、一切仰赖于黄。当原作者兼导演表示迟疑，提出是领导通过的剧本，作这样修改怕不妥当的时候，石挥沉不住气了，他大喝：“他们通过了怎么样？我们不通过就不能拍！”在石挥心目中，究竟应该由谁来领导创作，不是很明白了吗？尽管石挥放出各色各样的烟幕，说创作集体的“合作社”应由集体成员轮流负责，说他不愿作固定的社长，他的真正用心还是遮掩不住的。在他写的“我对‘谁是中心’的看法”（见1957年大众电影第一期）里，不是说得很露骨吗？他说：“创作关系以谁为中心要看具体情况来决定。”什么是具体情况呢？他说“如果有一个人，他能有像卓别林那样的才干，把制片、编、导、演、美术……集于一身的能力，那也未尝不可以让他一个人成为中心。”这个编、导、演集中于一身的人当然不是别人，正是石挥自己。正如同他所指的没有被重视的传统的代表者也不是别人，就是他自己，他所说的应该翻翻身的“上海人”也不是别人，就是他自己，归结一句话说：石挥始终没有忘记他在解放前的封建把头式的“皇帝”美梦，他不要做一个对党、对领导负责的创作集体的领导人，他要做一个由他指挥操纵的集团的幕后人物！
    事实说明，他也已经在操纵着这个集体，影响着许多年轻的编导，往人家的作品里灌注着他的毒汁。例如“情长谊深”就是在他的干涉之下，突出地歌颂了资产阶级友谊；例如“女篮五号”就曾在他的主张之下放弃主题思想去追求悲欢离合的情节。他要一个年轻编剧在写儿童问题的剧本里把今天的社会描写得十分阴暗，坚持要写进一段越剧女演员在台上演戏时把孩子绑在后台桌子腿上的戏。在不拍惊险样式片的口号遮掩之下，他坚持不准那个创作集体拍反特影片！
    看看石挥在集体内部提出的是什么样的纲领吧。他公开标榜他那个集体不搞重大题材，只写日常生活；他公开地说，影片不要管什么主题不主题，只要情节曲折观众爱看就行。请问这不是胡风的“随处有生活”的臭名远扬的理论的翻版是什么呢？这不是抗拒党的文艺反映当前主要斗争，文艺表现工农兵生活的方针，又是什么呢？不写重大题材，不反映工人农民的生活斗争，不要思想性，要什么呢？石挥提出的是要“趣味”，要“生活感与人情味”。在“雾海夜航”的短叙中他自夸这是他的努力目标。恰恰这部影片所拍出的样片具体地明确地说明了他所说的生活感是什么样的生活感，他所说的人情味是什么人的人情味。在他的描绘之下，工人、农民、解放军都成了只知道自己的箱子网篮的人，色情狂的人，歇斯底里的人，悲观绝望的人！他硬把自私自利的小市民的“生活感”套在工人、农民和战士的头上。他所说的“人情味”不过是些资产阶级趣味的庸俗噱头。
    当然，石挥这种反对思想性的噱头主义还有他自己的理论根据。和其他右派分子一样，石挥诬蔑说思想性赶走了观众，强调票房价值。只是他更走远一步，他公开提出“谁的影片卖钱谁就多分酬劳”的市侩主义的主张！所以，石挥不仅反对电影为广大工农群众服务，为社会主义的伟大事业服务，而且恬不知耻地以多分钱来号召，企图诱惑一些创作人员跟他走反党反社会主义的文艺路线，把电影作为迎合少数人的趣味，满足他个人名利欲望和野心的工具。
    本着党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的精神，在电影界是提出过题材限制不应过于严格，要根据作家水平来鼓励、诱导，也提出过要尊重各种风格各种流派。但是石挥想在这里钻空子是徒然的。因为谁也没有说过可以放弃为工农兵服务的方向，谁也没有说过可以对资产阶级的庸俗趣味让步，谁也没有说过可以把文艺创作的目的降低到追求“多分几个酬劳”。这样的文艺必然地不是有利而是有害于社会主义的。我们不可能一方面搞社会主义建设，一方面又允许创作工作者走这样的腐朽的资产阶级文艺路线！
    其实石挥也并不是真正反对作品应该有思想性。说到底，他不过是企图哄骗一些人，使人违背党的文艺方针，放弃马列主义的思想性。而石挥自己，在他的创作里，特别是在他的相声里，倒并不是没有思想性的（当然只能是反动的思想性）。正好相反，他的思想性是毫不含糊的，也是十分坚决的。
    前面说过，石挥到处说相声，对共产党、对社会主义、对新社会的一切讽刺诬蔑，用嘲笑打哈哈的“歪打”来“正着”他所仇视的一切新的事物。绝不能把这看作是石挥的说笑的天性，是他的“风格”。为什么在解放前对于反动统治黑暗势力，他从来不流露他这种“天性”，运用他这种“风格”加以嘲讽呢？这也还不能以石挥胆小怕遭反动派迫害来解释，因为他甚至对于当时报纸上口头上大家都在诟骂的投机倒把的奸商、黄牛党、米蛀虫，也没有像今天这样恶狠狠地嘲讽过。当然，在电影里面，石挥就不可能像在相声里那样露骨。电影有成千累万的观众的监督，有领导的审查，石挥就不得不“弯弯曲曲地讲话”，偷偷摸摸地贩运他的私货。然而他的思想立场，只要稍许注意分析一下，仍然是遮掩不住的。“关连长”的思想性还不够明确吗？“雾海夜航”的思想性还不够明确吗？在后一部影片里，尽管石挥表面上装出歌颂新社会歌颂解放军的姿态，事实上他歌颂的是坚持错误的船长——像石挥自己一样的“能人”——指责的是国家任务计划，歪曲的是工农兵形象。石挥爱什么，憎恶什么，拥护什么，反对什么？是十分清楚的。
    在这里，不能不特别提出石挥对青年演员的罪恶的蛊惑手段。石挥曾公开地对一些年轻演员们宣传他的“滚”的哲学。我们知道，石挥是反对各种学习的，从看书读报到创作会议都在他讽刺之列，认为是妨害了导演、演员的“艺术生活”的东西。在上海青年报召开的青年演员座谈会上，他公开地煽动说：“演员的职业就是演戏，不应搞其他的事！”上影厂有新参加工作的演员请教石挥该看些什么指导书刊，他回答说：“你只要多演两个戏，那些书看了只有坏处没有好处！”石挥是既反对政治学习，又反对业务理论学习，更反对深入生活与工农结合改造思想的。今天党所号召的上山下乡劳动锻炼，在石挥看来，当然是荒谬绝伦的了。因为照石挥说来，一个演员只要像他石挥一样，在舞台上“滚”他两年就可以“滚了出来”的。他公开地对新参加电影工作的女演员说：“你只要跟定我，两年之内包你红！”所以，一个演员能不能成功，问题只在于能不能得到石挥的提拔，而党所大声疾呼号召的深入生活改造思想以及提高自己的政治、生活、业务水平等等不仅是不必要的，而且只有“浪费演员的青春”，使他们成为“被积压的人材”。
    是的，我们也强调业务实践，我们也不反对有经验的老演员用带徒弟的方式培养新人。但是不难看出石挥所宣扬的“滚”的办法与我们所主张的以生活为基础的有理论作指导的业务实践是毫无共同之处的。石挥宣扬他的“滚”的哲学，其目的就是要蛊惑一部分小资产阶级出身的青年演员，使他们成为石挥的崇拜者，抗拒党对艺术工作者提出的改造自己的思想感情，改变自己的人生观世界观的要求。不需要深入生活，不需要与工农结合，不需要学习政治理论，不需要经过长期的艰苦的学习改造过程，只要多演两个戏，“滚”他两年，学会一些“控制观众”的窍门，就能吃着不尽，就能“包红”——试想，这对于某些小资产阶级出身的青年演员听来，岂不是一条很有诱惑力的“捷径”吗？
    我们必须拆穿石挥这种阴谋，使受到石挥蛊惑的青年演员们惊醒过来。首先应该指出：石挥这一套“滚”的哲学是行不通的。他自己奉行“滚”的哲学抗拒改造的结果就是一个最好的说明。他那一套“窍门”、“技巧”，离开了党的监督和帮助，只能拍出“关连长”、“雾海夜航”这样的影片，只能歪曲新人物的形象，只能产生出毒草；他对资产阶级立场的坚持最后只能使自己走上右派分子的反动道路！更必须指出：石挥以“滚”的哲学来蛊惑青年演员的真正目的，不过是要造成一群心甘情愿地追随他、崇拜他、为他所利用、盲目执行他的腐朽的反动的创作意图的，他所谓的“群氓”。
    石挥反对学习，反对改造，反对艺术讨论，反对强调作品的主题思想，他这一贯串动作的最高目的是十分明显的。他希望演员永远是政治上糊涂、思想上落后、甘心情愿受他搬弄的演员，编导永远是能听任他往作品里灌注毒汁的编导，换句话说，都成为他可以驱使，用以歪曲新社会反党反人民的工具！这就是石挥最恶毒的地方！
    所以，石挥不仅是在艺术路线上坚持和党对立的路线，宣扬什么票房价值，反对反映工人农民的生活斗争，不仅企图在变相的“为艺术而艺术”的、在所谓重视“生活感与人情味”的论调的掩护之下，贩卖他的资产阶级私货，而且有意识地迷惑青年，煽动创作人员，企图组织他可以操纵利用的集体，以达到他称孤道寡的目的，成为他反党反社会主义的地盘和工具！
    石挥的反党反社会主义仇视新社会，是和他的反动的阶级立场分不开的。从他的地主阶级的立场出发，从他的卑劣的个人欲望出发，他自然感觉得“今不如昔”，自然感觉得旧社会处处于他有利，新社会处处于他不利。
    解放后，党和人民给了石挥很多的东西：给了他各种各样的荣誉，给了他高级知识分子的待遇，市人民代表的地位，给了他拍摄影片的优先机会，并且具体帮助他拍出像“鸡毛信”、“天仙配”这样的较好的影片；但是他反而认为是糟蹋了他，认为是束缚了他的自由，他不但不感激，反而仇视党，仇视新社会，原因是他所重视的所需要的东西，党和新社会没法子满足他。党和新社会不能允许他像解放前一样投机倒把，不能允许他帮会把头式地剥削别人欺压别人，不能允许他随心所欲地玩弄女性侮辱女性，不能允许他的特务哥哥逍遥法外，不能允许他恢复他的杨柳青八大家之一的地主门庭，因此他坚决与人民为敌到底！
    有人为石挥的才华惋惜。是的，石挥可能是有一定的才华的，但这不是讨论石挥有没有才华或者有多大才华的时候，因为他在反对党反对社会主义，他在用他的才华来反党反人民，我们就不需要这样的才华。这个才华越大，只能是与我们越不利。
