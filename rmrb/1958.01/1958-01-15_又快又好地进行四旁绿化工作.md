Carry Out "Four-Around" Greening Work Quickly and Well
Liu Qingquan, Secretary of the Xia County Party Committee

    The National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) points out: "Starting from 1956, within twelve years, ... in all places beside houses, beside villages, beside roads, and beside water sources, wherever possible, trees should be planted in a planned way." Can this great goal be achieved quickly and well? Initially, some people in our county had doubts, but in our practice, it has been proven that any hesitation is unnecessary. As long as we strengthen leadership and rely on the masses, we can not only achieve it but also accomplish it ahead of schedule.

    How do we carry out the "four-around" greening work quickly and well?

  Cultivate Key Areas, Organize Visits
    Year-Round Preparation, Two Concentrated Efforts

    Xia County put forward the slogan "Strive for Greenification" as early as 1952, but in practical work, we encountered many ideological obstacles. For example, some people said at the time: "Planting trees is like watching the sea from the top of a mountain, distant water cannot quench immediate thirst"; others said: "Planting trees brings slow returns and affects farmland; trees are planted by wealthy families, not by poor ones." This series of negative emotions affected the smooth development of the tree planting movement. In order to dispel concerns and stimulate enthusiasm for tree planting, in addition to extensively publicizing the afforestation policy of "who plants owns, joint planting is jointly owned," we also started work in three aspects: First, we adopted the method of learning from local materials, summarizing typical examples, and conducting publicity and education to overcome conservative thinking. Second, from the county to the township and commune, we carried out comprehensive planning to show the masses the prospects for greening, which encouraged the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for greening. Third, we cultivated key areas, created models, organized visits, and promoted demonstrations. In 1952, we identified Zhouchen and Guodao villages as key greening areas. After two years of cultivation, we began to organize large-scale visits from 1954. By the autumn of last year, we had organized six visits for 1,500 county, township, and commune cadres. At the same time as the visits, we promoted more than 400,000 poplar trees, which strongly promoted the "four-around" greening movement throughout the county.

    Tree planting work is mainly concentrated in the spring and autumn seasons. Based on this characteristic, we adopted a concentrated tactic during the tree planting season. In the spring of the year before last, the secretary took action and went all out to mobilize more than 100,000 men and women in the county to launch a vigorous "four-around" greening "assault week." Last year, we carried out two large-scale greening "assault ten-day periods" in spring and autumn. Experience has shown that as long as we can implement year-round preparation, two concentrated efforts, and long-term protection, we can quickly green the "four-around" areas in a few years.

    Select Fast-Growing Tree Species
      Green the "Four-Around" Areas as Soon as Possible

    Selecting fast-growing tree species can quickly increase the income of the masses, stimulate their enthusiasm for afforestation, and achieve the "four-around" greening quickly and well. In the tree planting and afforestation movement in our county, we selected eight excellent varieties such as poplar, weeping willow, locust, ailanthus, and Chinese toon, which have good wood and grow fast. The poplar is the most popular. In addition to good wood and fast growth, it also has the unique characteristics of fewer diseases and pests, easy survival, small crown, and less shading of the land, and it is also alkali-resistant and water-resistant, and can be densely planted. Planting this kind of tree can not only achieve the greening task faster but also support the country's need for timber faster and increase farmers' income. Liang Hongyuan of Guodao Village planted 1,500 poplar trees in 1952. After five years of development, he now has more than 5,000 trees. In addition to building three new houses, he also earned more than 500 yuan. Therefore, the masses like to say: "Plant poplars for ten years, and you don't have to worry about food and clothing; they become rafters in four years, purlins in six years, and are very beautiful as carrying poles in ten years." Because the masses have personally seen that developing fast-growing trees brings quick results and great benefits, it has further encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to plant poplar trees. From the year before last to last year, more than 2 million such trees were promoted throughout the county, accounting for more than 20% of the total number of trees. Poplar trees were planted in every village. At the same time, they also paid attention to the development of fruit trees and timber trees with hard wood. At present, in addition to mountain fruits, there are more than 320,000 fruit trees such as peaches, apricots, pears, dates, hawthorns, persimmons, and apples in the plains, accounting for 0.8% of the total number of trees. There are more than 12 million timber trees with hard wood such as Chinese locust, catalpa, cypress, elm, and mulberry, accounting for 35% of the total number of trees.

    Establish Nurseries in Every Commune
      Everyone Starts Seedling Cultivation

    Cultivating nurseries and tapping the potential of seedlings is an important guarantee for achieving greening. In 1951, we established a nursery, but we did not rely on the masses or mobilize them to cultivate seedlings, so we still could not solve the seedling difficulties. In 1952, we transferred 150,000 seedlings from Zhongtiao Mountain to support the tree planting of the masses in Emei Ridge and Jiwang Mountain, but the survival rate was only 50%. We learned from this lesson. In 1953, in addition to entrusting the masses to cultivate 40 acres of seedlings for the state, we also put forward the slogan of "self-cultivation and self-planting" to the masses, calling on everyone to cultivate 300 acres of seedlings, which prepared a solid material foundation for large-scale tree planting. In the past few years, in the "four-around" greening, in addition to more than 1.66 million seedlings supplied by the state, the masses cultivated and planted more than 4.3 million seedlings, which is nearly twice the number supplied by the state. The year before last, in order to ensure continued victory on the greening front, we put forward the slogan of "establish nurseries in every commune, and everyone starts seedling cultivation." Rural areas, government agencies, and schools collected a total of 310,000 kilograms of tree seeds and cultivated 846 acres of nurseries for various trees, cultivating about 4 million seedlings. At the same time, we implemented a mutually beneficial policy, and the commune paid a reasonable price for the trees planted by commune members, which greatly encouraged the masses to cultivate seedlings. In addition, from 1952, we also mobilized the masses to preserve more than 26 million wild seedlings and trees regenerated after logging, which strongly guaranteed the smooth development of the greening movement.

    Implement Reward Policies
      Encourage the Enthusiasm of the Masses

    After the advanced stage of cooperativization, we insisted that all the original large and small scattered trees were privately owned by the commune members, and we did not adopt the method of appraising and purchasing them into the commune. It is also stipulated that the water and roadside areas of the commune members' private plots and the areas beside their personal houses shall be planted with trees by the commune members themselves, and the tree rights belong to themselves; all the river and roadside areas collectively planted by the cooperatives shall belong to the collective of the agricultural cooperative. In order to ensure the quality of afforestation and achieve "guaranteed planting, guaranteed survival, and guaranteed forest formation," we put forward model conditions at the beginning of each afforestation movement. After the end of the afforestation, we conducted inspections and comparisons, and commended and rewarded model individuals and collectives. At the same time, in terms of labor remuneration, we stipulated and implemented a method of qualitative and quantitative determination, phased work recording, and unified profit distribution with the agricultural cooperative. After the implementation of the reward method, it not only inspired the enthusiasm of the masses for tree planting but also improved the quality of tree planting.

    Promote Agroforestry Intercropping
      Expand Farmland Area

    Planting according to local conditions, improving land utilization, and expanding farmland area, so that long-term interests and immediate interests are closely combined, can more effectively mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses for tree planting. On this issue, they have initially summarized and promoted three methods: ① In low-lying land with high water levels, heavy alkalinity, and inability to grow crops, use the method of opening ditches to drain water and concentrate the water into the trenches. Plant rice in the trenches, plant poplar trees around, and intercrop cotton or beans in the middle. This not only develops trees but also expands the farmland area. ② In the development of fruit trees, intercrop alfalfa, wheat, and beans according to the different characteristics and growth periods of fruit trees, so that the immediate interests of farmers are not affected, and there is hope for long-term interests. ③ Planting drought-resistant and wind-resistant trees and intercropping osier in barren sandy land is also a good method. Qinjia Yan Village, Xinxing Agricultural Cooperative, Yuwang Township, intercropped 35 acres of osier in 1955, harvested 40,000 kilograms of strips, which were processed and woven into willow baskets, dustpans, water dippers, etc., earning a total of more than 5,000 yuan, equivalent to 30% of the total agricultural income of the entire cooperative.

    Extensively Impart Technology
      Guarantee Tree Planting Survival

    At first, we thought that tree planting was rough work and there was no technology to learn. Therefore, before 1953, the masses still used the old methods for tree planting, and the survival rate was very low. In order to learn from this lesson and strengthen technical guidance, we convened meetings of activists and trained a large number of technical backbones every year before the tree planting movement. In the past few years, we have trained more than 1,200 technical backbones. Especially in 1956, in order to adapt to the upsurge of "four-around" greening, we conducted a comprehensive technical training in the county and also issued technical reference materials. Now, the broad masses of people understand the afforestation techniques of deep planting, solid ramming, root spreading, short exposure, dense planting, and watering, which has improved the survival rate of tree planting. A total of more than 5.74 million trees were planted in the year before last and last spring, with a survival rate of more than 85%, an increase of 29% compared with 1953.

    Implement Forest Protection Policies
      Formulate Greening Covenants

    As the saying goes, "Planting trees without protecting them is like not planting them at all." Although Xia County generally established forest protection organizations in 1952, and the mountain areas were also divided into forest protection and fire prevention responsibility areas, the policy of "rewarding forest protectors and punishing forest destroyers" was not fully implemented. Therefore, not only did the phenomenon of indiscriminate logging of trees still exist, but also from 1953 to 1954, there were 23 consecutive fires in the mountainous areas, destroying more than 30,000 trees. These events educated us. In May 1954, we held a cadre and mass meeting in the mountainous area, commended and rewarded 23 forest protection models, and sentenced forest destroyers such as Qiao Duonv to fixed-term imprisonment. Since then, model awards have been held once a year, and forest protection policies have been included as political courses in various schools and farmers' spare-time schools, and the masses and students are often educated to love trees as they love their lives, effectively protecting the development of trees. The phenomena of forest destruction, fire, and indiscriminate logging of trees have decreased year by year. There were three forest fires in 1955, and mountain fires have disappeared from the year before last to last year.

    After the great development of afforestation work in 1956, in order to further protect the greening achievements, we put forward the slogan of "guaranteed planting, guaranteed survival, and guaranteed growth" to the people of the county, and rectified and improved the forest protection organization. According to the residential location of government agencies, schools, and rural areas and the tree planting situation, we divided the responsibility areas. The county people's committee drafted the "Greening Covenant," which was discussed and revised by townships and communes to educate the masses. Now, every commune in the county has a "Greening Covenant," everyone understands how to protect trees, and the masses' sense of responsibility for forest protection has been greatly enhanced. In the case of drought and no rain, watering and weeding and other tending work were carried out more universally, ensuring the healthy growth of trees.

  With the Spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains
      Strive for Greater Achievements

    Although we have made achievements in the "four-around" greening work, we will never be satisfied with this. We plan to plant another 20 million scattered trees in the "four-around" areas of the county from 1958 to 1962, afforest 50,000 acres of barren mountains on a large scale, and cultivate seven fruit tree belts and windbreak belts. By the end of the second five-year plan, each household will have an average of more than 1,700 trees. The forest area will be developed to 260,000 acres. After the implementation of this plan, the income from trees and fruit production can be greatly increased. Calculated at 7% annual felling of timber, 2.5 million trees can be felled, with a value of about 10 million yuan. Calculated at an annual output of 15 million kilograms of fruit, the total income of these two items is more than 11 million yuan. In this way, the average annual forestry income per person will be 68 yuan, equivalent to the past living standard of middle peasants.

    Of course, there are still difficulties in completing this arduous task. In addition to continuing to promote and learn from past experiences and lessons, we must also earnestly learn from the experience of other places, overcome all difficulties with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, resolutely rely on the masses, follow the mass line, and bravely strive to fully realize the greening task of the county.

    又快又好地进行四旁绿化工作
    中共夏县县委书记　刘清泉
    全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）指出：“从1956年起，在十二年内，……在一切宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁，只要是可能的，都要有计划地种起树来”。这个伟大的奋斗目标，能不能又快又好地实现呢？起初，在我县一部分人的思想上是怀疑的，但在我们的实践里，证明了任何犹豫都是不必要的。只要加强领导，依靠群众，不仅能够实现，而且可以提前办到。
    我们是怎样又快又好地进行四旁绿化呢？
  培养重点，组织参观
    全年准备，两次突击
    夏县在1952年，就提出了“为实现绿化而奋斗”的口号，但在实际工作中，曾遇到不少思想阻力。如当时有人说：“栽树是干山头上望大海，远水解不了近渴”；有的说：“种树收益慢，影响庄稼田，树是富家栽，穷家栽不来”。这一系列的消极情绪，影响着植树运动的顺利开展。为了解除顾虑，启发植树造林的积极性，我们除大量宣传“谁栽归谁，伙栽伙有”的造林政策外，又从三方面着手进行了工作：一是采取了就地取材，总结典型，进行宣传教育，克服了保守思想。二是由县到乡、社，普遍进行了全面规划，向群众展现出绿化的远景，鼓舞了干部和群众绿化的劲头。三是培养重点，做出样子，组织参观，示范推广。在1952年，我们就确定周陈、郭道村为绿化重点。经过两年培养，从1954年就开始大量组织参观，到去年秋季，共组织县乡社干部一千五百人进行了六次参观。在参观的同时，推广了钻天杨四十多万株，有力地推动了全县四旁绿化运动。
    栽树这个工作，主要集中在春秋两季，我们根据这个特点，在植树季节，采用了突击的战术。前年春季，曾由书记动手，全力以赴，在全县范围内，发动男女群众十万余人，掀起了轰轰烈烈的四旁绿化“突击周”，去年又在春秋两季开展了两次规模壮大的绿化“突击旬”。经验证明，只要能够贯彻全年准备，两次突击，长期保护，就可以在几年内很快地把四旁绿化起来。
    选栽速生树种
      尽快绿化四旁
    选栽速成树种，能尽快地增加群众收入，激发群众的造林积极性，并能又快又好地实现四旁绿化。我县在植树造林运动中，共选拔出木材好、生长快的钻天杨、百爪柳、洋槐、臭椿、苦栋等八种优良品种。而钻天杨又最为时行。它的特点除木材好，生长快以外，还具有病害少、容易活、树头小、少遮地的独特性，并且耐碱耐水，还能进行密植。选栽这种树，既可较快地实现绿化任务，又能更快地支援国家对木材的需要，还能增加农民收入。郭道村梁鸿元，1952年栽植钻天杨一千五百株，经过五年的发展，现在有五千多株，除盖起新房子三间外，还收入五百余元。因此群众喜爱地说：“插杨十年，不愁吃穿，四年成椽，六年成檩，十年做个担材非常美”。由于群众亲眼看到发展速生树收效快，收益大，就更加鼓舞了群众栽植钻天杨的积极性。从前年到去年，在全县共推广这种树二百多万株，占总树数的20％以上，各个村庄都栽起了钻天杨。同时，他们也注意了果木树和木质坚硬的用材树的发展。现在全县除山果外，尽平川的桃、杏、梨、枣、沙果、柿子、苹果等果木树即达三十二万多株，占总树数的0.8％。木质坚硬的用材树如国槐、楸、柏、榆、桑等树种有一千二百多万株，占总树数的35％。
    社社建立苗圃
      人人动手育苗
    培育苗圃挖掘苗木潜力，是实现绿化的重要保证。1951年，我们就建立了一个苗圃，但没有依靠群众，发动群众育苗，仍然解决不了苗木困难，1952年，从中条山调运树苗十五万株，支援峨嵋岭和稷王山等地群众植树，结果成活率仅达50％。我们接受了这个教训，1953年除委托群众给国家育苗四十亩外，又向群众提出“自育自栽”的口号，号召大家动手育苗三百亩，这就给大量植树准备了雄厚的物质基础。几年来在四旁绿化中，除国家供应树苗一百六十六万多株外，群众自育自栽的就达四百三十多万株，超过国家供应数字将近两倍。前年为了保证在绿化战线上继续胜利，我们又提出了“社社建立苗圃，人人动手育苗”的口号。农村、机关、学校共采取树籽三十一万斤，培养各种树木的苗圃八百四十六亩，约育苗四百万株。与此同时，贯彻了互利政策，社里栽植社员树木均由社付给合理价格，这对群众育苗也起了极大鼓舞作用。此外，从1952年起，还动员群众保苗野生和伐后萌芽更新的树木二千六百多万株，有力地保证了绿化运动的顺利开展。
    贯彻奖励政策
      鼓舞群众热情
    在高级合作化以后，我们坚持了原有的大小零星树木均归社员私有，没有采取作价收买入社的办法。又规定社员自留地的水旁、路旁和个人宅旁，均由社员自己栽树，树权归己所有；凡是一切河流，道路旁由合作社集体栽植的，树权归农业社集体所有。为了保证造林质量，做到“保植、保活、保成林”，我们在每年造林运动的开始，即提出模范条件。在造林结束以后进行检查评比，对模范个人和集体都进行了表扬和奖励。同时在劳动报酬上，规定和实行了定质定量，分期记工，与农业社统一分红的办法。贯彻奖励办法后，不但启发了群众的植树积极性，而且提高了植树的质量。
    推广农林间作
      扩大农田面积
    因地种植，提高土地利用率和扩大农田面积，使长远利益和眼前利益紧密结合起来，才能更有效地调动群众植树积极性。他们在这个问题上，初步总结与推广了三种办法：①在地势洼、水位高、碱性重、不能种植农作物的土地上，用开渠排水的办法，将水集中引到壕内，壕里栽稻子，周围插植钻天杨，中间套种棉花或豆子。这样既发展了树木，又扩大了农田面积。②在发展果木中，按照果木不同特性和生长期，分别套种苜蓿、麦子和豆类，使农民的眼前利益不受影响，长远利益也有指望。③在瘠薄的沙滩地，栽植耐旱耐风的树木，套种杞柳，也是一种好办法。禹王乡新兴农业社秦家堰村，1955年套种杞柳三十五亩，割条四万斤，经过加工，编成柳篮、簸箕、水斗等，共赚五千多元，相等全社农业总收入的30％。
    广泛传授技术
      保证植树成活
    起初，我们认为植树是粗活，没有技术可学。因而，在1953年以前，群众植树仍是老办法，成活率很低。为接受这一教训，加强技术指导，每年在植树运动前，都召开了积极分子会议，训练大批技术骨干。这几年共培养技术骨干一千二百多人。特别是在1956年，为适应四旁绿化高潮，在全县进行了技术普训，还印发了技术参考资料。现在广大群众都懂得了深栽、实捣、根展、短露、密植、浇水的造林技术，提高了植树成活率。前年和去春共栽植五百七十四万多株，成活率达到85％以上，较1953年提高29％。
    贯彻护林政策
      制订绿化公约
    俗话说：“栽树不护树，等于没栽树”。夏县在1952年，虽然普遍建立起护林组织，山地也划了护林防火责任区，但对“护林者奖，毁林者罚”的政策还贯彻执行的不够，因此不仅乱伐树木的现象依然存在，而且1953年到1954年，在山区连续失火二十三起，毁林三万多株。这些事件教育了我们，1954年5月份，在山区召开干部群众大会，表扬奖励二十三个护林模范，宣判毁林罪犯乔多女等有期徒刑。此后，每年评奖模范一次，并把护林政策，列为各个学校和农民业余学校的政治课，经常教育群众和学生爱树如爱命，有效地保护了树木的发展。毁林失火与滥伐树木的现象逐年减少，1955年还发生林火三起，从前年到去年山火已经绝迹。
    1956年在造林工作大发展以后，为了进一步保护绿化成果，向全县人民提出了“保植、保活、保长大”的口号，又整顿与健全了护林组织，根据机关、学校、农村的住地和树木栽植情况，划分了责任区，由县人民委员会草拟“绿化公约”，经乡、社讨论修订，以资教育群众。现在全县社社都订有“绿化公约”，人人懂得保护树木，群众护林责任心大大增强。在天旱不雨的情况下，较普遍地进行了浇水和锄草等抚育工作，保证了树木的健康生长。
  以愚公移山精神
      争取更大的成绩
    我们虽然在四旁绿化工作上做出了成绩，但绝不因此而满足。我们计划从1958年到1962年，全县再在四旁零星植树二千万株，荒山大片造林五万亩，培育果木林带、防风林带七条。到第二个五年计划末，每户平均有树一千七百多株。山林发展到二十六万亩。这个计划实现后，树木收入和果品生产就可以大为增加。木材以每年砍伐7％计算，可伐木二百五十万株，价值约达一千万元，果品以年产一千五百万斤计，这两项合计收入为一千一百多万元。这样仅林业收入，每人每年即平均六十八元，相当过去中农生活水平。
    当然，要完成这个艰巨的任务，还是有困难的。我们除继续推广和记取已往的经验教训外，还要认真学习外地经验，以愚公移山的精神，战胜一切困难，坚决依靠群众，走群众路线，为完满地实现全县绿化任务而英勇奋斗。
