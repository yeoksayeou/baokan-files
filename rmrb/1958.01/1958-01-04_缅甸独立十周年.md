Ten Years of Burmese Independence

Today marks the tenth anniversary of Burmese independence. Ten years ago today (January 4, 1948), the people of Burma shook off British colonial rule and proclaimed the establishment of the Union of Burma.

The establishment of the Union of Burma was the result of the long-term struggle for national independence by the Burmese people. As early as the end of the 16th century, Portuguese and Dutch colonial forces infiltrated Burma. In the early 17th century, British colonial forces began to invade Burma. From 1824, Britain launched three Anglo-Burmese Wars, and in 1885 Burma became a British colony.

For more than sixty years, the British colonialists carried out brutal exploitation and bloody rule in Burma. The Burmese people, who loved freedom and independence, bravely fought the British colonialists one after another. The victory of the October Socialist Revolution encouraged the struggle of the Burmese people. In 1920, Burma experienced an unprecedented national education movement against colonial enslavement education. In 1930, tens of thousands of farmers in Burma, led by the monk Saya San, launched the Tharrawaddy anti-British armed peasant uprising. In 1938, Burmese oil workers launched the largest anti-British strike in history, which immediately developed into an anti-British general strike and school strike movement and a large-scale demonstration, which more powerfully promoted the widespread development of the national independence movement.

During World War II, in 1942, Japanese militarists occupied the entire Burma, and after Britain, brutally enslaved the Burmese people. In 1944, Burmese patriotic forces rose up to form the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, a united front organization for national anti-Japanese resistance, leading the people of the whole country to launch an anti-Japanese struggle. In March 1945, they cooperated with the Allied counteroffensive to drive the Japanese invaders out of Burmese territory.

After Japan surrendered, British colonialists made a comeback, attempting to re-establish colonial rule. However, Burmese patriotic forces resisted resolutely. In September 1946, an unprecedented nationwide strike of workers, civil servants, and police broke out, forcing the Burmese government controlled by British colonialists to collapse. Under the resolute struggle of the Burmese people, British colonialists had to make concessions. After several rounds of negotiations, the Anglo-Burmese Treaty was signed at the end of 1947, recognizing Burma's independence from the British Commonwealth.

After achieving independence, Burma began to heal the wounds of war, eliminate the evils of colonialism, and develop its own national economy. The Burmese government nationalized some of the large enterprises formerly occupied by British monopoly capital through compensation, established state-owned enterprises and cooperatives, and abolished the imperial tariff preference system, further freeing the Burmese economy from the shackles of imperialism. In agriculture, the Burmese government began to implement land nationalization in the 1953-54 fiscal year, redeeming land from landlords with compensation. In the four years up to 1957, the actual land nationalized reached 20% of the target. In the 1952-53 fiscal year, the Burmese government began to implement an eight-year national prosperity plan. In recent years, Burma has made significant progress in its national economy. Between the 1951-52 and 1956-57 fiscal years, Burma's total output increased by 29%. In the 1956-57 fiscal year, total production had increased to 95% of pre-war levels. The output of rice, Burma's main economic lifeline, increased from 3.8 million tons in the early post-war period of 1946-47 to 6,362,800 tons in 1956-57.

The Burmese government pursues a foreign policy of peace and neutrality, and has made significant efforts to safeguard national independence, oppose colonialism, and maintain world peace, winning praise from peace-loving countries around the world and greatly enhancing its international status. In 1955, Burma, along with other Colombo countries, actively initiated the Asian-African Conference, making a significant contribution to the success of this conference. Burma is playing an increasingly important role in promoting solidarity among countries in Asia and Africa and maintaining world peace.

China and Burma are close neighbors with a long and deep friendship. After the two countries gained independence, this deep friendship developed on a new basis. In June 1954, the Prime Ministers of China and Burma jointly issued the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and the friendly relations between the two countries have developed further. In recent years, great achievements have been made in economic and cultural cooperation, and friendly exchanges between the two countries have increased day by day. The visit of the two Burmese Deputy Prime Ministers U Ba Swe and U Kyaw Nyein to our country further strengthened the friendly relations between the two countries. The friendship between China and Burma will flow forever like the Yangtze River and the Irrawaddy River. (Ke Xianwei)

    缅甸独立十周年
    今天是缅甸独立十周年纪念日。十年前的今天（1948年1月4日），缅甸人民摆脱了英国的殖民统治，宣告缅甸联邦的成立。
    缅甸联邦的成立是缅甸人民进行长期的民族独立斗争的结果。早在十六世纪末叶，葡萄牙和荷兰殖民势力就渗入缅甸。十七世纪初期，英国殖民势力开始侵入缅甸，从1824年起，英国发动了三次侵缅战争，1885年缅甸沦为英国殖民地。
    英国殖民者对缅甸进行残酷剥削和血腥统治达六十多年之久。爱好自由和独立的缅甸人民前仆后继地对英国殖民者展开了英勇的斗争。十月社会主义革命的胜利，鼓舞了缅甸人民的斗争。1920年，缅甸爆发了空前规模的反对殖民地奴化教育的国民教育运动。1930年缅甸数万农民在僧侣塞雅山的领导下，爆发了达拉瓦底反英武装农民大暴动。1938年缅甸石油工人发动了有史以来规模最大的反英大罢工，并立即发展成为反英总罢工罢课运动和声势浩大的示威大游行，更加有力地推动了民族独立运动的广泛开展。
    第二次世界大战期间，1942年日本军国主义者占领了整个缅甸，继英国之后残酷地奴役缅甸人民。1944年缅甸爱国力量起来组成抗日民族统一战线组织——反法西斯人民自由同盟，领导全国人民展开抗日斗争。并于1945年3月配合盟军的反攻，把日本侵略者赶出缅甸国土。
    日本投降后，英国殖民者卷土重来，妄图重新建立殖民统治。但是，缅甸爱国力量进行了坚决的反抗，1946年9月间，爆发了空前规模的全国工人、公务员和警察大罢工，迫使英国殖民者把持的缅甸政府宣告垮台。在缅甸人民坚决斗争下，英国殖民者不得不作了让步。经过数度谈判，1947年底签订了英缅协定，承认缅甸脱离英联邦独立。
    在取得独立之后，缅甸就着手医治战争创伤，铲除殖民主义的恶果，发展自己的民族经济。缅甸政府通过赔偿的方式把过去为英国垄断资本所占有的一部分大企业收归国有，兴办国营企业和合作社，废除帝国关税特惠制，使缅甸经济进一步摆脱帝国主义的束缚。在农业方面，缅甸政府曾在1953—54年度开始实行土地国有化，以补偿的方式向地主赎买土地，到1957年的四年中，实际完成国有化的土地达到目标的20％。1952—53年度，缅甸政府开始实施一项八年国家繁荣计划。几年来，缅甸在国民经济方面已经取得了显著的进步。在1951—52财政年度和1956—57财政年度之间的几年中，缅甸的总产量增加了29％。在1956—57年度，总生产已经增加到战前水平的95％。而缅甸主要经济命脉的稻谷的产量，已从战后初期1946—47年度的三百八十万吨增加到1956—57年度的六百三十六万二千八百吨。
    缅甸政府奉行和平中立外交政策，为维护民族独立、反对殖民主义和维护世界和平作了重大的努力，获得世界爱好和平的国家的赞扬，大大提高了它的国际地位。1955年缅甸和其它科伦坡国家一道积极发起召开亚非会议，对于这个会议的成功作了重大的贡献。在促进亚非两洲各国间的团结、维护世界和平的事业中，缅甸正在起着越来越大的作用。
    中国和缅甸是亲密的邻邦，有着悠久而深厚的友谊。两国获得独立后，这种深情厚谊就在新的基础上发展起来。1954年6月，中缅两国总理共同发表了和平共处的五项原则，两国友好关系就有更进一步的发展。近几年来，在经济和文化合作方面已经取得了很大的成就，彼此友好往来日益增多。这次缅甸两位副总理吴巴瑞和吴觉迎的访问我国，进一步加强了两国的友好关系。中缅两国的友谊将会像长江和伊洛瓦底江的流水一样永远长流。　（柯贤伟）
