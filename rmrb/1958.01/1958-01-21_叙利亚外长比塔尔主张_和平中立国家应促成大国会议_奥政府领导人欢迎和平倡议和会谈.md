Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 20th: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar told a Cairo radio reporter on the evening of the 19th that peaceful and neutral countries have a responsibility to take active steps to facilitate talks between the heads of major powers to end the "Cold War."

Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: TASS, Vienna, January 19th: Austrian Vice-Chancellor and Socialist Party member, Pittman, said: "The Socialist Party in the government and parliament will always have a positive attitude towards suggestions that can guarantee peace and free cooperation for the people of all countries." This was his reply to questions raised by reporters from the Austrian Socialist Party newspaper regarding the international situation.

In addition, the Socialist Party newspaper also published statements by Austrian Interior Minister Helmer and State Secretary Kreisky on the same issue.

Interior Minister Helmer pointed out in his speech: The recent Soviet statement on the international situation is certainly worthy of special attention. He added that one can sense in the remarks of prominent Soviet political figures a desire to end the arms race. "The danger threatening Europe, and therefore also our country located in Central Europe, is great, so we welcome any initiative and talks, as long as it is possible to limit the arms race and achieve the safety of everyone on our planet."

State Secretary Kreisky, when asked whether it is appropriate to negotiate on unresolved international political issues, said: "I am in principle in favor of negotiations between representatives of the major powers, because I believe that this is the only way to use existing possibilities to achieve mutual understanding."

    叙利亚外长比塔尔主张
    和平中立国家应促成大国会议
    奥政府领导人欢迎和平倡议和会谈
    据新华社开罗20日电　叙利亚外交部长比塔尔19日晚上对开罗电台记者说，和平中立国家有责任采取积极的步骤促使大国首脑举行会谈，以结束“冷战”。
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社维也纳19日讯：奥地利副总理、社会党人皮特曼说：“社会党在政府和议会中对能够保证各国人民和平和自由合作的建议永远抱肯定态度”。这是他对奥地利社会党报纸的记者提出的有关国际局势问题的答复。
    此外，社会党报纸还发表了奥地利内政部长赫尔麦和国务秘书克赖斯基就同一问题发表的谈话。
    内政部长赫尔麦在谈话中指出：苏联最近有关国际局势的声明肯定是值得特别注意的。他补充说，在苏联著名政治活动家的言论里可以感到结束军备竞赛的愿望。“威胁欧洲，从而也威胁位于中欧的我国的危险很大，所以我们欢迎任何倡议和会谈，只要有可能限制军备竞赛和取得我们的星球上一切人的安全”。
    国务秘书克赖斯基在回答是否宜于就悬而未决的国际政治问题进行谈判的问题时说：“我原则上主张大国代表进行谈判，因为我相信，只有这种方法才能够运用现存可能性来达到相互谅解。”
