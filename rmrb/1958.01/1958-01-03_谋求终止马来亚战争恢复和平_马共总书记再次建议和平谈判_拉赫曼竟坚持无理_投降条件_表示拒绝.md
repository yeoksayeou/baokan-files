Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Kuala Lumpur dispatch: According to newspaper reports, the Malayan Federation government announced on December 21, 1957, that the General Secretary of the Malayan Communist Party, Chen Ping, wrote to the Prime Minister of the Malayan Federation, Rahman, on December 9, saying that he was prepared to send Rashid Maidin and Chen Tian as representatives to hold preliminary talks with Rahman's representatives. The letter stated that the purpose of the preliminary talks was to ensure that a fair and reasonable agreement could be reached in the subsequent talks between Chen Ping and Rahman, so as to end the war and restore peace in Malaya.

Chen Ping pointed out in his letter that the goal of the Malayan Communist Party in launching an armed revolution was to overthrow the colonial regime and fight for the independence of Malaya. The Malayan Communist Party has no intention of treating the elected government as an enemy, and there is obviously no reason for it to surrender to the elected government. The Malayan Federation government has promised the people to end the "Emergency," therefore, the Federation government should be as sincere as the Malayan Communist Party, and reach a fair and reasonable agreement with the Malayan Communist Party based on unconditionally ending the war, rather than discussing unreasonable surrender conditions.

On the same day that the Malayan Federation government published Chen Ping's letter, it also published Rahman's statement. In his statement, Rahman stated that the Malayan Federation government refused to hold talks with the Malayan Communist Party. He said that the Malayan Federation government believes that "reconciliation with Chen Ping is impossible unless Chen Ping is willing to surrender."

Before the independence of the Malayan Federation, the Malayan Federation government and the Malayan Communist Party held peace talks in Baling in December 1955. Due to the Federation government's insistence that the MCP accept surrender conditions, the talks were fruitless. After this, the Malayan Communist Party continued to strive to end the war through negotiations. On the second day of the Malayan Federation's declaration of independence (September 1, 1957), the Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party issued a declaration, once again calling for an immediate end to the war and the realization of peace in Malaya. In order to achieve this goal, the Malayan Communist Party once again declared that it was willing to stop armed struggle and participate in various activities for the independence, democracy, and prosperity of Malaya through democratic means within the framework of the constitution.

The Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party put forward the basic propositions of the Malayan Communist Party in the declaration: 1. Strengthen and safeguard the independent status of Malaya; realize an independent, autonomous, peaceful and neutral foreign policy, establish diplomatic relations with all countries; oppose war, uphold peace, and not participate in any military bloc; strengthen solidarity and cooperation with Asian and African countries; and promote the unification of Singapore and the Malayan Federation. 2. Implement the unity and mutual assistance of the Malay, Chinese, and Indian ethnic groups with the Malay nation as the center, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of all ethnic groups in the country. 3. Guarantee the democratic and free rights of the people, and release all arrested patriotic political prisoners nationwide; all political parties and social organizations loyal to the Malayan motherland shall enjoy legal status. 4. Protect and develop national industry, agriculture, and commerce, improve and develop cultural undertakings, implement universal education, and improve people's lives. 5. End the war and abolish the "Emergency Regulations"; realize domestic peace.

The declaration pointed out that the most pressing task for all ethnic groups in the country is to stop the war, lift the "Emergency," and realize domestic peace. The Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party called on all ethnic groups in the country to unite and strive to end the war, realize domestic peace, and build Malaya into a completely independent, democratic, free, peaceful, and prosperous new country.

On October 4, Rahman issued a statement on the declaration of the Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party, still adhering to his "surrender" conditions. But he stated that Chen Ping could write to him directly, and said, "If necessary, I will arrange a meeting."

The declaration of the Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party aroused enthusiastic responses among the Malayan public, who demanded that the Federation government reopen negotiations with the Malayan Communist Party and restore peace. Dewan, General Secretary of the Malayan Trade Union Council and member of the Legislative Council, said that he hoped that the Federation government would adopt a realistic attitude to hold talks with the Malayan Communist Party and seek a solution.

On October 12, Chen Ping wrote to Rahman, expressing his willingness to hold another meeting with him in order to reach a fair and reasonable agreement to end the war. Chen Ping also said that he hoped that this meeting could reach an agreement satisfactory to both parties, therefore, he suggested that preliminary talks be held first between his representative and Rahman's representative.

While announcing Chen Ping's letter on November 8, Rahman issued a statement saying that he agreed to hold preliminary talks. However, he also described the preliminary talks as being for "discussing arrangements for surrender." After this, Rahman continued to make speeches, continuing to demand that the Malayan Communist Party accept "surrender" conditions, and stated that "he will never recognize the Malayan Communist Party as a legal political party."

Chen Ping's specific proposal for peace talks excited people from all walks of life in Malaya, and public opinion believed that "Malaya is showing a glimmer of peace." The People's Progressive Party of Malaya issued a statement on November 9, saying that Chen Ping's letter provided a good opportunity for Malaya to move towards peace. The party's General Secretary, Seenivasagam, pointed out that Rahman's view that the Malayan Communist Party was "ready to surrender" was wrong.

However, Rahman finally rejected Chen Ping's further proposal on December 9 for holding preliminary talks on December 21. Rahman's attitude disappointed and dissatisfied the Malayan public. David, General Secretary of the All-Malaya Factory and General Workers' Union, said on December 21 that for the sake of the people's happiness and the country's interests, Rahman should not insist on the unconditional surrender of the Malayan Communist Party, but should adopt a tolerant attitude and try to end the war. Foo Chee Yun, secretary of the Selangor branch of the Malayan Labour Party, said at the Bukit Bintang branch members' meeting of the party in Selangor on December 22 that Rahman should hold peace talks with the Malayan Communist Party. The conference passed a resolution requesting the Federation government to abolish the "Emergency Ordinance" as soon as possible and consider recognizing the legal status of the Malayan Communist Party.

    谋求终止马来亚战争恢复和平
    马共总书记再次建议和平谈判
    拉赫曼竟坚持无理“投降条件”表示拒绝
    据新华社2日讯　吉隆坡消息：据报纸报道，马来亚联合邦官方在1957年12月21日宣布，马来亚共产党总书记陈平在12月9日写信给马来亚联合邦总理拉赫曼说，他准备派拉昔·迈丁和陈田为代表同拉赫曼的代表举行初步会谈。信中说，初步会谈的目的是：确保在以后举行的陈平和拉赫曼的会谈中可以获致公平合理的协议，以便终止战争，恢复马来亚的和平。
    陈平在信中指出，马来亚共产党发动武装革命的目标是：打倒殖民政权，为马来亚的独立而斗争。马来亚共产党无意把民选政府当作敌人，也显然无由产生它向民选政府投降的问题。马来亚联合邦政府已经答应人民结束“紧急状态”，因此，联合邦政府应该和马来亚共产党同样的诚恳，以无条件结束战争为根据，和马来亚共产党获致公平合理的协议，而不是谈不合理的投降条件。
    马来亚联合邦官方在发表陈平的信的同一天，还发表了拉赫曼的声明。拉赫曼在他的声明中表示，马来亚联合邦政府拒绝与马来亚共产党举行会谈。他说，马来亚联合邦政府认为，“除非陈平愿意投降，与陈平和解是不可能的”。
    在马来亚联合邦独立以前，马来亚联合邦政府同马来亚共产党曾经在1955年12月在华玲举行和平谈判。由于联合邦政府坚持要马共接受投降条件，以致会谈没有结果。在这以后，马来亚共产党仍然继续为通过谈判结束战争而努力。在马来亚联合邦宣告独立的第二天（1957年9月1日），马来亚共产党中央委员会发表宣言，再一次呼吁立即结束战争，实现马来亚和平。为着实现这个目的，马来亚共产党再一次声明，愿意停止武装斗争，在宪法范围内通过民主方式来参加为马来亚的独立、民主、繁荣而斗争的各种活动。
    马来亚共产党中央委员会在宣言中提出了马来亚共产党的基本主张是：一、增强和保障马来亚的独立地位；实现独立自主、和平中立的外交政策，同一切国家建立外交关系；反对战争，拥护和平，不参加任何军事集团；同亚非国家团结合作；促进新加坡、马来亚联合邦的统一。二、实行以马来民族为中心的马、华、印各族的团结互助，保护国内各民族的正当权益。三、保障人民的民主自由权利，释放全国一切被捕的爱国政治犯；凡效忠马来亚祖国的各政党、各社团均享有合法地位。四、保护和发展民族工业、农业和商业，改进和发展文化事业，实行普及教育，改善人民生活。五、结束战争，废除“紧急条例”；实现国内和平。
    宣言指出，全国各族人民当前最迫切的任务是：停止战争，解除“紧急状态”，实现国内和平。马来亚共产党中央委员会号召全国各族人民团结起来，为结束战争、实现国内和平，为把马来亚建设成为一个完全独立的、民主自由的、和平繁荣的新国家而奋斗。
    10月4日，拉赫曼就马来亚共产党中央委员会的宣言发表声明，仍然坚持他的“招降”条件。但是他表示陈平可直接写信给他，并说，“如有必要时，我会安排一项会谈。”
    马来亚共产党中央委员会的宣言在马来亚公众中引起了热烈的反应，他们纷纷要求联合邦政府同马来亚共产党重开谈判，恢复和平。马来亚工会理事会总书记、立法议会议员狄哇说，他希望联合邦政府采取现实的态度同马来亚共产党举行会谈，寻求解决方案。
    10月12日，陈平就写信通知拉赫曼，表示准备再度和他举行会谈，以便获致一项公平合理的协议，结束这场战争。陈平又说，希望这次会谈能够达成使双方满意的协议，因此，他建议先由他的代表和拉赫曼的代表举行初步会谈。
    拉赫曼在11月8日公布陈平来信的同时，发表文告说，他同意举行初步会谈。但是，他又把初步会谈说成是为了“讨论有关投降的安排事宜”。在这以后，拉赫曼又接连发表谈话，继续要马来亚共产党接受“招降”条件，并且表示“决不承认马来亚共产党为合法政党”。
    陈平关于和平谈判的具体建议使马来亚各界人士感到兴奋，舆论认为“马来亚呈现和平曙光”。马来亚人民进步党11月9日发表文告说，陈平的来信提供了使马来亚走向和平的良好机会。这个党的总书记薛尼华沙甘指出，拉赫曼认为马来亚共产党“准备投降”的看法是错误的。
    但是，拉赫曼终于在12月21日拒绝陈平12月9日关于举行初步会谈的进一步建议。拉赫曼的这种态度使马来亚公众感到失望和不满。全马来亚工厂和普通工人联合会总书记戴维在12月21日说，为人民的幸福和国家的利益着想，拉赫曼实在不应该坚持要马来亚共产党无条件投降，而应该抱着忍让的态度，设法结束战争。马来亚劳工党雪兰峨州分部书记符致云12月22日在这个党的雪兰峨州武吉免登支部党员大会上致词时说，拉赫曼应该与马来亚共产党举行和平谈判。这个大会通过决议，要求联合邦政府早日废除“紧急法令”，并且考虑承认马来亚共产党的合法地位。
