Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 13th: Nanjing city factories and enterprises, based on rectification, will mobilize the masses of workers to launch a special criticism high tide of "burning the waste," starting with anti-waste to check the implementation of the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift.

Nanjing factories have achieved significant savings through years of increasing production and practicing economy. However, there are still appalling phenomena of waste. According to incomplete statistics, in the 300,000 big-character posters put up by workers during the great blooming and contending, 30% expose and criticize waste in various aspects of enterprises, including manpower, equipment, materials, funds, design, technology, operation, and management.

According to the materials initially revealed by the workers during the criticism and the inspection materials of the leading cadres of each factory during the rectification, many wasteful phenomena are caused by the lack of a diligent and thrifty approach to running factories and careful calculation on the part of the leaders and management personnel. Some units, in the process of capital construction and adding equipment, blindly sought grandeur and novelty, spending lavishly and wasting valuable state funds. The thirteen employee dormitories built by the Nanjing Radio Factory last year were fully equipped with flush toilets, sinks, and other sanitary facilities. If they had followed the principle of thrift, they could have built at least two more buildings to house more people. A toilet built by the Nanjing Teaching Instrument Factory was made of reinforced concrete, costing about 100 yuan per square meter, which greatly exceeded the standards set by the state. The Phoenix Mountain Iron Mine spent 50,000 yuan on a bathroom and 39,000 yuan on a clinic, with rather elaborate construction, but some people still complained that it was not beautiful enough.

Many wasteful phenomena are caused by the bureaucracy and lack of accountability of enterprise leaders. The Phoenix Mountain Iron Mine once lost fourteen tons of anti-corrosion oil. The leaders made a cursory investigation, couldn't find out what happened, and then dropped the matter. Some drilling bits worth thousands of yuan were casually discarded, and no one cared. Some units' leaders neglected to conduct regular education on diligent and thrifty enterprise management for all employees, resulting in a very thin atmosphere of thrift, while the "young master" style was everywhere. Workers in a factory once found expensive product parts and tools such as vacuum tubes, amplifiers, and micrometers in the trash cans.

Many factories and enterprises have not fully implemented the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, and neglecting product quality and thrift has caused a lot of waste. The Nanjing Glass Factory produces more than 30,000 defective glass cups every month, worth more than 7,000 yuan; the defective rate of thermos bottles produced every month is 14,000, worth more than 14,000 yuan; and the defective rate of wine bottles produced every month is 90,000, worth 4,500 yuan. The reason for this lies in the failure to strengthen technical leadership and establish and improve the quality responsibility system closely around improving quality. During the great blooming and contending, the cooks of the Nanjing Radio Factory posted a couplet to the Bakelite workshop: the upper line was "Guarantee quality, radio shells are sent to the kitchen to burn," the lower line was "High skills and craftsmanship, products pile up like mountains outside the door," and the horizontal inscription was "Defective Products Workshop" in four large characters. It turned out that each bakelite shell produced by this workshop was worth more than ten yuan, but defective products were often produced, and after being scrapped, they were piled up and sent to the kitchen to be burned as firewood.

### 反掉大少爷作风勤俭办企业  南京各工厂将掀起反浪费鸣放高潮

    反掉大少爷作风勤俭办企业
    南京各工厂将掀起反浪费鸣放高潮
    据新华社南京13日电　南京市工厂企业将在整改的基础上，发动职工群众掀起一个“火烧浪费”的专题鸣放高潮，从反浪费着手检查对勤俭建国方针的贯彻执行情况。
    南京市工厂经过历年来的增产节约运动，节约成绩是显著的，但仍存在惊人的浪费现象。据不完全统计，职工在大鸣大放贴出的三十万张大字报中，有30％是揭发和批评企业的人力、设备、材料、资金以及设计、工艺、操作、管理等各方面的浪费现象。
    根据职工在鸣放中初步揭发的材料和各厂领导干部在整改中的检查材料，有很多浪费现象是由于领导上和管理人员缺乏勤俭办厂、精打细算的思想所造成的。有些单位在进行基本建设和添置设备时，一味的贪大求新，大手大脚，浪费了国家的宝贵资金。南京无线电厂去年盖的十三幢职工宿舍，抽水马桶、洗手池等卫生设备一应俱全，如果从节约原则出发，起码可以多盖两幢房屋，供给更多的人居住。南京教学仪器厂建筑的一座厕所，是钢筋水泥结构，每平方公尺造价达一百元左右，大大超过了国家规定的标准。凤凰山铁矿用五万元盖浴室、三万九千元盖医务所，建筑相当考究，但仍有人嫌不漂亮。
    有不少浪费现象是由于企业领导上的官僚主义和无人负责所造成的，凤凰山铁矿曾丢失防腐油十四吨，领导上检查一下，查不出究竟，也就不了了之。有的价值千把元的钻探机钻头，随便丢置在一旁，无人过问。有些单位的领导人忽略对全体职工进行经常的勤俭办企业的教育，以致节约风气非常稀薄，而“大少爷”作风到处都有。有个工厂的职工曾在垃圾箱里发现有真空管、扩音器、分厘卡等价值昂贵的产品部件和工具。
    许多工厂企业没有全面贯彻多、快、好、省的方针，忽视产品质量和忽视节约造成大量的浪费。南京玻璃厂生产的玻璃杯每月废品达三万多只，价值七千多元；每月生产的热水瓶的废品达一万四千只，价值一万四千多元；每月生产的酒瓶的废品达九万只，价值四千五百元。究其原因，都在于没有紧紧围绕提高质量加强技术领导，建立和健全质量责任制度。南京无线电厂在大鸣大放中，炊事员给胶木工段贴了一副对联，上联是“保证质量收音机壳送到厨房烧”，下联是“手高艺巧产品出门堆得如山高”，横批是“废品工段”四个大字。原来这个工段生产的胶木壳每只价值十几元，但是常出废品，报废后成堆地送往厨房当木柴烧掉。
