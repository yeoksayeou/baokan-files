    Be as Firm as a Warrior
    Ge Ji, a member of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers

    Recently, I received letters from some friends back home, all discussing going up to the mountains and down to the countryside. Some have already settled down in the countryside, while others have signed up with their organizations, striving for approval to be sent down. The letters are vividly written, filled with excitement and joy, as if I were seeing my friends full of energy, rubbing their fists and wiping their palms, as excited and thrilled as our troops when participating in battle.

    These friends of mine are all intellectuals who have studied for more than ten years. Therefore, there is a common language in their letters: "Participating in labor is the fundamental path for the ideological transformation of intellectuals. To pass the socialist test and become a working-class intellectual, one must temper oneself in labor." However, some of them still have some concerns before going up to the mountains and down to the countryside. One friend wrote in a letter: "I am worried about my two children. Growing up in the countryside will not be as lively as in the city, and the education in the countryside is not as good as in the city. This ideological problem has not been properly resolved for a long time." Another friend wrote in his letter: "I grew up in the countryside, carried manure, hoed the fields, and did all kinds of work. I am not afraid of labor, but I have a stomach problem. It is better in the city, where treatment and maintenance are more favorable. Going to the countryside makes me a little worried."... They wanted me to express some opinions, but I thought for a long time and couldn't think of appropriate words to answer them. I just want to tell my friends: When our troops participate in battle, our soldiers often do not consider their health or personal matters, but consider how to earn merit and how to win the battle. For the victory of the battle, they insist on fighting with illness and stay on the front line even when wounded. I hope that the comrades who are being sent down can be as brave and as firm as soldiers participating in battle in tempering themselves in labor. Your bodies will become stronger, and your children will also receive labor education, and perhaps they will grow up more lively and promising than in the city!

    要像战士那样坚定
    中国人民志愿军某部　戈基
    最近，我接到国内一些朋友的来信，他们都谈到上山、下乡的事。有的已经在农村安家落户，有的已经向组织报名，争取批准下放。信写得很生动，字里行间充满着兴奋愉快。我读着这些信，仿佛看到我的朋友精神抖擞，磨拳擦掌，好像我们部队在参加战斗时那样激动，那样兴奋。
    我的这些朋友都是读过十多年书的知识分子。因此，在来信中有一句共同语言：“参加劳动是知识分子思想改造的根本道路，要过社会主义关，要想使自己成为工人阶级的知识分子，就必须到劳动中去锻炼。”他们只是有的人在上山下乡之前尚有一些顾虑，一个朋友来信说：“我耽心的是两个孩子，到农村去不能像在城市里成长来得活泼，乡下的教育也不如城市，这个思想问题，还久久得不到妥善的解决。”另有一个朋友给我的信中说：“我是在农村长大的，挑粪、锄地，什么活都干过，劳动倒不怕，只是我有胃病，在城市还好，治疗、保养有有利的条件，到乡下去，多少使我有点发愁。”……他们要我发表一些意见，可是我想了很久，想不出恰当的话去回答他们。我只想用这样的话告诉我的朋友：当我们部队在参加战斗的时候，我们的战士，往往不考虑身体，不考虑私事，而是考虑怎样能够立功，怎样能够打胜仗。他们为了战斗胜利，有病坚持战斗，负伤不下火线。我希望下放的同志们能够像战士参加战斗时那样勇敢，那样坚定地到劳动中去锻炼。你们的身体将会炼得更加健壮，你们的孩子也将受到劳动教育，也许会比在城市长得更加活泼，更加有前途！
