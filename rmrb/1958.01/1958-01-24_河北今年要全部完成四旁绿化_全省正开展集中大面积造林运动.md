	Hebei to Complete Greening of "Four Sides" This Year
	Province Launches Concentrated, Large-Scale Afforestation Campaign
	Xinhua News Agency, Baoding – The Third Hebei Provincial Forestry Conference, currently being held here, unanimously resolved to complete the province's "four sides" (villages, houses, roads, and waterways) greening tasks within this year. This year, all parts of the province will utilize all available gaps in the "four sides" to plant 600 million trees. At the same time, they will strengthen the tending and management of the large number of trees newly planted in the "four sides" in recent years to promote rapid growth to timber.
	In the past, the original trees on the "four sides" of Hebei Province were almost completely destroyed due to war and the sabotage of reactionary ruling classes. Since liberation, especially in the past two years, the broad masses of people have actively carried out the "four sides" tree planting campaign, planting more than 890 million trees, including over 400 million trees in the past two years alone. Now, thousands of green villages and green communes have emerged across the province, greening hundreds of rivers and roads. Many places, which in the early days of liberation had no trees on the "four sides" and suffered severely from wind, sand, and floods, have now been transformed into a green landscape where "villages appear like dense forests from afar, roads are shaded by green trees up close, rivers flow with clear water, and sandstorms do not arise on the beaches." After the province's "four sides" greening task is completed this year, in just over a decade, timber for civilian use can be self-sufficient in areas with fewer trees, and areas with more trees can supply large quantities of raw materials for the paper and man-made fiber industries.

	Xinhua News Agency, Baoding – Agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Hebei Province are concentrating their efforts to carry out a large-scale afforestation campaign, striving to accelerate the greening of barren mountains and sandy wastelands. This year, the province plans to create twelve "double ten-thousand mu forests," 166 "ten-thousand mu forests," and 2,758 "five-thousand mu forests," "three-thousand mu forests," "two-thousand mu forests," and "thousand mu forests." Through such concentrated large-scale afforestation, the total area afforested this year can reach 3.79 million mu, exceeding the province's actual afforestation area last year by more than 18%.

	Currently, in the colder northern regions, many agricultural cooperatives are collecting tree seeds and protecting tree branches, preparing to begin a concentrated tree planting and afforestation campaign after the weather warms up. In the warmer southern regions, where there is less snow and thin ice, winter afforestation activities are still continuing. In Wei County, thirty agricultural cooperatives and twenty primary schools in the Tenth Camp Township recently planted more than 610,000 trees on an area of more than 2,000 mu in three days. Lizili Agricultural Cooperative in Nanhe County has also recently planted 25,000 trees.

	As early as the spring of 1956, the Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Baima River Township, Xingtai County, created the experience of creating a "ten-thousand mu forest." In mid-February of that year, the cooperative mobilized more than 2,400 male and female members and spent seven days completing the afforestation task on more than 13,000 mu of barren mountains. After discovering this creative leap-forward experience in afforestation, the Hebei Provincial Forestry Department immediately promoted it. According to preliminary investigations, in the past two years, 53 "ten-thousand mu forests" and "five-thousand mu forests" and 350 "thousand mu forests" have emerged throughout the province, along with dozens of forest networks over a hundred li long. Facts have proven that this method not only boosted the confidence of cooperative members in eliminating barren land and sandy wastelands on a large scale and powerfully accelerated the completion of afforestation tasks, but also resulted in a survival rate that was generally about 10% higher than that of general scattered afforestation.

### 河北今年要全部完成四旁绿化  全省正开展集中大面积造林运动

    人人动手植树　加快绿化速度
    河北今年要全部完成四旁绿化
    全省正开展集中大面积造林运动
    新华社保定电　正在此间举行的河北省第三次林业会议一致作出决议，要在今年内全部完成本省的四旁（村旁、宅旁、路旁和水旁）绿化任务。今年，全省各地要利用一切可以利用的四旁空隙地植树六亿株，同时要加强这些年来在四旁新植的大批树木的抚育管理，促使树木迅速成材。
    河北省过去的四旁原有树木，因遭受战争和反动统治阶级的破坏，大树差不多完全没有了。解放以后，特别是近两年来，广大人民积极开展四旁植树运动，已植树八亿九千多株，过去两年间就植树四亿多株。现在，全省已经出现了数以千计的绿化村、绿化社，绿化了数以百计的河道和公路。不少解放初期还是四旁无树、风砂和水患为害严重的地方，现在已经变成了“远望村庄像密林，近观道路成绿荫，大小河川流碧水，沙滩刮风不起尘”的一片绿化景象。今年全省的四旁绿化任务完成以后，十多年后就可以做到少树地区民用材自给，多树地区还可以大批供应造纸和人造纤维工业用原料。
    新华社保定电　河北省各地农业社正在集中力量开展大面积造林运动，争取加快速度绿化荒山和沙荒地。今年全省计划营造“双万亩林”十二片，“万亩林”一百六十六片，“五千亩林”、“三千亩林”、“二千亩林”和“千亩林”二千七百五十八片，经过这样集中力量大面积造林，今年可以完成造林总数三百七十九万亩，超过去年全省实际造林数18％以上。
    目前，天气较冷的北部地区，许多农业社正在采集树种，保护树条，准备天气转暖后开始突击植树造林。南部地区气温较暖，雪少冰薄，冬季造林活动仍在继续进行。威县第十营乡的三十个农业社和二十个小学校，最近三天时间就在两千多亩地的面积上植树六十一万多株。南和县里自农业社，最近也已植树两万五千株。
    早在1956年春天，邢台县白马河乡灯塔农业社就创造了营造“万亩林”的经验。这个社在当年2月中旬，发动两千四百多个男女社员，用七天时间，突击完成了一万三千多亩绿化荒山造林任务。河北省林业厅发现这一创造性的造林跃进经验后，立即加以推广。据初步调查，两年来全省已出现“万亩林”和“五千亩林”五十三片，“千亩林”三百五十片，长百里以上的林网几十片。事实证明：这种办法不仅鼓舞了社员们大片消灭荒地和沙荒地的信心，有力地加快了造林任务的完成，而且成活率普遍比一般零星分散造林高10％左右。
