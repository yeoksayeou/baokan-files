Make Whatever is Needed, Produce it Immediately, Repair it as Soon as it Breaks
Hunan and Shaanxi Handicraft Workers Go to the Countryside and Mountains to Support Agricultural Production

(Our Newspaper News) The broad masses of handicraft workers in Hunan Province are actively rushing to manufacture and repair farm tools for agricultural cooperatives. They have put forward the action slogan of "Starting early and working late, taking advantage of every moment, overcoming difficulties, and going all out."

At present, among the more than 90,000 handicraft production personnel in the province who directly serve agricultural production in the iron, wood, and bamboo industries, about 60% are busily manufacturing and repairing tools needed for agricultural production. In the Chen County area, there are 2,000 ironworkers and 4,000 carpenters who have gone to the countryside and cooperatives to support agricultural production. In many areas, they have achieved "minor repairs not leaving the township, major repairs not leaving the county." Shuangfeng County originally had 322 farm tool repair stations and mobile repair groups, and recently added 95 more. In the Liling South Township area, there were originally 45 iron furnaces, with 101 iron industry cooperative members, producing in 12 locations. Now, 20 mobile groups have been added to go to the countryside, with a total of 32 iron furnaces moving around in the nearby countryside, basically achieving "arriving whenever called, without delaying agricultural work."

Many handicraft cooperatives are also trying everything possible to support agricultural production in other aspects. All handicraft laborers in Qidong County are determined, on the premise of not affecting their own production, to help each agricultural cooperative accumulate more than 27,000 dan of fertilizer, assist in water conservancy construction with more than 5,800 workdays, and invest more than 100,000 yuan in agricultural cooperatives from January to September this year. Handicraft cooperative members in Wugang Town have already accumulated 138,000 dan of fertilizer for agricultural cooperatives.

(Our Newspaper News) In Ankang Special District, Shaanxi Province, more than 250 handicraft cooperatives and groups in iron, wood, and bamboo industries recently had 68% of their personnel go to the countryside and mountains to support agricultural production and water conservancy construction. This is a new phenomenon since the rectification movement among handicraft workers in this special district.

In the rectification movement of these handicraft cooperatives and groups, Party committees at all levels emphasized that handicraft workers should implement the policy of "serving agriculture as the main focus," change business methods, overcome the past shortcomings of "waiting for customers to come to the door," and advocate that handicraft workers bring their tools to the countryside and mountains, carrying out production in the spirit of "taking materials locally, processing locally, and supplying locally." The members of each handicraft cooperative group also raised many criticisms and suggestions regarding the above-mentioned issues in the great airing of views and debate, suggesting that handicraft workers go to the countryside and mountains, facing the rural areas. Subsequently, most of the cooperatives and groups launched a surge of handicraft workers going to the countryside and mountains. The iron industry production cooperatives in all ten counties of the special district dispatched 519 people, organized 118 mobile production teams to go to the countryside, and also established 13 repair stations in the remote mountainous areas where households are scattered. They brought their red furnaces and tools to the agricultural cooperatives, producing whatever the farmers needed, making it as soon as it was needed, and repairing it as soon as it broke. In the past two months, they produced more than 26,000 pieces of tools for water conservancy, such as picks, hand crowbars, steel chisels, sledgehammers, and sharp hoes, and repaired more than 6,000 pieces of old farm tools, basically meeting the needs of tools in the water conservancy movement. Most of the carpenters and bamboo craftsmen in various places have been sent to agricultural cooperatives to help farmers install waterwheels and weave earth baskets and bamboo cages.

Handicraft workers going to the countryside and mountains have strongly supported agricultural production, solved the problem of having nothing to do, and increased the income of cooperative members. After the red furnace of the Machi District Iron Industry Cooperative in Shiquan County was moved to the countryside, it changed from having no work to do in the past to processing day and night and still not being able to meet the demand. From November to now, the total income of the cooperative has been more than 4,000 yuan, and in addition to distributing it to the cooperative members, it has also repaid part of the loan to the bank. The handicraft workers who went to the countryside and mountains all reflected that going to the countryside and mountains has four advantages: having work to do every day is the first advantage; no backlog of funds is the second advantage; increased income is the third advantage; and farmer satisfaction is the fourth advantage.

    要啥造啥　随要随制　随坏随修
    湖南陕西手工业者下乡上山支援农业生产
    本报讯　湖南省广大手工业者积极为农业社赶制和修理农具。他们提出了“起早贪黑，随要随有，克服困难，全力以赴”的行动口号。
    目前，全省直接为农业生产服务的铁、木、竹等行业的九万多个手工业生产人员中，约有60％以上的人在紧张地制造和修配农业生产所需要的工具。郴县地区下乡下社支援农业生产的铁工有两千人，木工有四千人。很多地区作到了“小修不出乡，大修不出县”。双峰县原有农具修配站和流动修配组三百二十二个，最近又增加了九十五个。醴陵南乡一带，原有四十五座铁炉，铁业社员一百零一人，分十二个地点生产，现在又增派了二十个流动组下乡，共有三十二座铁炉在附近乡下流动，基本上做到了“随喊随到，不误农时”。
    不少手工业社还想尽一切办法从其他方面支援农业生产。祁东县全体手工业劳动者决心在不影响本身生产的前提下，帮助各农业社积肥二万七千多担，协助兴修水利出工五千八百多天，并要在今年1月至9月份向农业社投资十万多元。武冈城关镇手工业社员已经为农业社积肥十三万八千担。
    本报讯　陕西省安康专区二百五十多个铁业、木业、竹业等手工业社、组，最近有68％的人员下乡上山，支援农业生产和水利建设。这是这个专区手工业者参加整风运动以来的新气象。
    在这些手工业社、组的整风运动中，各级党委强调了手工业者要贯彻执行“为农业服务为主”的方针，改变经营方法，克服以往“等客上门”的缺点，提倡手工业者带上工具下乡上山，本着“就地取材，就地加工，就地供应”的精神，进行生产。各手工业社组的成员，在大鸣大放中也针对上述问题提出了很多批评意见，建议手工业者下乡上山，面向农村。接着，绝大部分社组便掀起了手工业者下乡上山的热潮。全专区十个县的铁业生产社，就抽出了五百一十九人，组织了一百一十八个下乡流动生产小组，另外还在人户分散的深山地区建立了十三个修配站。他们把红炉、工具带上，到农业社里，农民需要啥，就生产啥，随要随制，随坏随修。两个月来，他们生产的洋镐、手撬、钢钎、晃锤、尖镢等水利上用的工具，有二万六千多件，还修补了破旧农具六千多件，基本上满足了水利运动中工具的需要。各地木匠、篾匠等手工业者，大部分都被派到农业社，帮助农民安装水车，编土篮、篾笼等用具。
    手工业者下乡上山，有力地支援了农业生产，同时解决了无活可做的问题，使社员收入增加。石泉县马池区铁业社红炉搬下乡后，由过去没有活做变成日夜加工赶制还满足不了需要。从11月份到现在，全社收入四千多元，除分配给社员外，还向银行归还了一部分贷款。下乡上山的手工业者都反映下乡上山有四好：天天有活做第一好；不积压资金第二好；收入增加第三好；农民满意第四好。
