No Room for "Regret"!
Chen Wenshu

After an extraordinary spring, a fighting summer, and a fighting autumn last year, many people's eyes have become brighter, and many people's feet have stood firm. Many people have learned these lessons at the cost of stumbles and detours. "A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit". It's not always a bad thing.

However, can we rest easy now? I'm afraid it's not that simple. Recently, I have heard some things that make me think that the understanding gained by many of our comrades in the anti-rightist struggle still needs to be checked regularly and constantly consolidated.

In many units, when dealing with rightists, rightists who had infiltrated the Party were also purged. This is a very satisfying thing. For the sake of the Party's interests, this is absolutely necessary. Because these people have long harbored ulterior motives, betrayed the Party, and betrayed the revolution. For these people, "those who do evil will not survive". Although they infiltrated the Party for several years, they never completely changed their original face; now we can't say that they have lost their Party membership, because they never obtained genuine Party membership in the first place.

I want to talk about other people. These people, although they have gone through the great storms of the anti-rightist struggle, have not yet learned more from this storm. One example is that they are still somewhat soft-hearted when purging those class enemies and class alien elements from the Party. They either feel regret, feeling that it is "achieving all but a basketful," even if they don't say it, they are murmuring in their hearts, or they believe that this is an internal Party issue that should be treated with "leniency after confession," and they even demand that "leniency" be extended to the point of eliminating the line between the enemy and ourselves. If the former's ideological sentiment still belongs to right-leaning sentiment, a kind of warm and fuzzy sentiment, a kind of fumbling after just gaining a firm foothold; then the latter's argument is an extremely serious political error, and if it develops, it will inevitably lead to a major stumble again.

Rightist elements within the Party are traitors to the Party. The contradiction between the Party and the rightist elements who have infiltrated the Party is, of course, a contradiction between the enemy and ourselves. How can it be said to be an internal Party issue? Suppose we were as kind-hearted as "Mr. Dong Guo," and left these class enemies and class alien elements in the Party due to "regret" or some other reason, what would be the result? They would still secretly gnaw at the Party and erode the Party, and once they encountered any disturbance, they would, like this time, collude from within and without, and openly sabotage the Party from within the Party's fortress again. We just learned this lesson last year, and the lesson is not far away. "Tolerance towards the enemy is a crime against the revolution." I believe that this sentence should also apply to dealing with rightist elements who have infiltrated the Party.

For those who are still salvageable, the Party has always tried its best to help them. However, for those who are seriously individualistic or have made serious mistakes, completely lost the proper stance of a Communist Party member, or are incorrigible and beyond redemption, the Party will also expel them from the Party. What good is it to the Party to keep such people in the Party, like leaving a festering sore? We should not be soft-hearted towards such people, let alone towards those who have degenerated into traitors to the Party and political enemies? No matter how long they have been Party members, how much talent they have, or how great their abilities are, they are always our enemies. The Party cleanses them precisely to save them, so that they can truly start anew. In this process, there is no room for the slightest "regret"!

### “惋惜”不得！

    “惋惜”不得！
    陈文澍
    经过去年一个不平凡的春天、一个战斗的夏天和秋天，许多人的眼睛明亮了，许多人的脚跟站稳了。许多人是用摔了交、走了弯路的代价换来这些教训的。“吃一堑，长一智”。也未尝不是好事。
    然而，是不是就此可以对自己高枕无忧了呢？怕就没有那样简单。最近听到一些事，使我想到我们许多同志在反右派斗争中取得的认识，还需要经常地检查检查，不断地巩固。
    有许多单位在进行对右派分子处理的时候，混入党内的右派分子也被清洗了。这是大快人心的事。为了党的利益，这样做是完全必要的。因为这些人早就胸怀二心，叛变了党，叛变了革命。对于这些人来说，“自作孽，不可活”，他们虽则混入党内几年，但是从来没有彻底改变本来面目；现在也不能说他们是失去党籍，因为他们原就不曾取得真正的党籍的。
    我要说的是另外一些人。这些人，虽则经过反右派斗争那一段时期的大风大浪，但是还没有从这次风浪中取得更多的教育。例子之一，就是他们在清洗那些阶级敌人、阶级异己分子出党的时候，还有些手软。他们或则是不胜惋惜，觉得是“为山九仞，功亏一篑”，即使嘴里不说，心里也在嘀嘀咕咕，或则是认为这是党内的是非问题，应该“坦白从宽”，并且要求“宽”到连敌我是非的界限都取消了。如果说前者的思想情绪，还只是属于右倾情绪、温情主义；是刚刚站稳脚跟后的蹒跚；那么，后一种论调，就是极为严重的政治错误，发展下去，又不免要摔大交了。
    党内右派分子是党的叛徒。党和混入党内的右派分子的矛盾，当然是敌我矛盾，怎能说是党内的是非问题？不妨设想一下，如果我们像“东郭先生”那样好心肠，由于“惋惜”或者别的什么理由，把这些阶级敌人、阶级异己分子留在党内，结果会怎样呢？他们依然会偷偷摸摸地啃啮党，腐蚀党，一旦遇到什么风吹草动，他们又会像这次一样地里应外合，从党的堡垒内部再公开来破坏党。这是我们去年刚领教了的，殷鉴并不算远。“对敌人的宽容，就是对革命的犯罪”。我认为这句话，对处理混入党内的右派分子，应该也是同样适用的。
    对于还有救药的可能的人，党从来都是尽力救治的。但是，对于那些严重的个人主义者或者犯了严重错误、完全丧失一个共产党员应有的立场或者屡教不改，已经无可救药的人，党也是要把他们开除出党的。把这样的人留在党内，就如留下一个脓疮，对党有什么好处？对这些人，尚且不能手软，何况对那些已经堕落成为党的叛徒和政治上的敌人的分子呢？不管他们有多长的党龄，有多大的才能，有多了不起的本领，他们总归是我们的敌人。党清洗他们，也正是为了挽救他们，使他们真正能重新做人。在这中间，丝毫“惋惜”不得！
