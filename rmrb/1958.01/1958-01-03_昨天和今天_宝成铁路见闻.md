    Yesterday and Today
    —Sights and Sounds of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway
    By our correspondent Ji Xichen

    A winter night. The direct express train from Chengdu to Xi'an gradually slowed down as it passed through the green expanse of the western Sichuan Plain and entered the dark, deep valley of the Daba Mountains. Silence, drowsiness... Accompanied by the rhythmic sound of the wheels, many passengers swayed and fell asleep. At this moment, only an elderly woman in her fifties kept raising her head from the train window, anxiously asking people:
    "Are we at Jianmen Pass yet?"
    "Not yet."
    "Please, be sure to tell me when we get there!"
    With that, she wrapped her headscarf tighter and leaned over the window, anxiously watching the darkness outside.
    Who was she? Why was she so concerned about Jianmen Pass? Filled with curiosity, I started a conversation with her and told her bluntly that although the train passes through the Jianmen Mountain area, it does not go through Jianmen Pass itself. If it were daytime, you might be able to see the "Seventy-Two Peaks of Jianmen" from the train, but now you can't see anything. Unexpectedly, my words made her so sad that she burst into tears.
    "Actually, it's easier on my heart if I don't see it. Seeing it would only make me more upset..."
    "Why?"
    "My hometown is in Shandong, and I fled to Sichuan when the war started. Back then, there were no trains, and even horse-drawn carriages were hard to find... My husband took our family of four, and it took us more than ten days to walk from Baoji to Jianmen Pass. The mountains were so high! One day, while we were crossing the mountains, my husband slipped and fell, and our three-year-old child rolled off the cliff from the carrying basket. We never even saw the body..."
    On the Shu Road, countless incidents like this, of people falling and carts overturning, had happened in the past. For thousands of years, the towering peaks, bottomless valleys, precarious plank roads, and raging torrents have stood as obstacles to travelers. Although our ancestors paid a huge price to conquer the natural barrier between Qin and Shu, the Shu Road remained "harder than ascending to heaven" for many dynasties. But today, the railway workers have used their own hands to fulfill the long-cherished wish of the Chinese people in just five short years. In the place where "even the yellow crane cannot fly across," the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has connected Sichuan and Shaanxi. Dragon-like trains, soaring like clouds and mist, are speeding through valleys and mountains, transporting countless goods and passengers to all parts of the motherland. Talking about this earth-shaking change, the old woman smiled:
    "Yes! The old days will never come back. Look at me, now I'm also taking the train to visit my hometown, aren't I?"
    At this moment, a dazzling light suddenly appeared outside the window, and the roar of machines and the shouts of workers entered the warm and peaceful carriage. What was this? A bustling city or a newly built factory? No, it wasn't. This was the surging Jialing River and Bailong River, the areas of massive collapses and landslides like Matiawan, Dujiaba, and Tanjiazhuang, the steep cliffs like Shoupan Cliff and Pipa Cliff where even eagles have difficulty flying, and the snow-covered Qinling Mountains. To ensure that trains could run smoothly through these areas, thousands upon thousands of workers, with drilling machines, pneumatic drills, and picks and shovels, were fighting day and night in the valleys and on the mountains, sinking vertical shafts, opening horizontal tunnels, building open-cut tunnels, and constructing retaining walls and protective slopes, clearing large amounts of quicksand, landslides, and collapses.
    In the process of treating 2,136 instances of collapse, erosion, and landslides, the workers demonstrated great perseverance and tenacity. As one worker at the Baishuijiang station construction site said: "Rescuing and repairing collapses is like launching a counter-offensive on the battlefield. Every section of mudflow and collapse must be fought over and attacked dozens or hundreds of times. It is repaired and collapses again, collapses and is repaired again, until the collapsing and sliding mountains and earth become docile and peaceful, and the line engineering is improved to be more solid and excellent, then people move on to other places." Because of this, even when the region encountered unprecedented floods and torrential rains last year, there was no long-term interruption of traffic on the entire line.
    "Ahead is Tanjiazhuang, Huangsha River!"
    "The connecting point of the north and south sections of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway in 1956!"
    The conductor's voice triggered countless memories in me. Looking at the familiar construction sheds, the villages on the mountainside, and the lights in the tunnels, I searched intently for the place where the last spike was driven. I remember that a year and a half ago, in anticipation of the "July 1st" connection date, this area of the valley seemed to have become a decisive battlefield. On construction sites spanning more than a thousand li, an army of 100,000 laborers worked selflessly and courageously. Whether during the scorching days or the nights of torrential floods, the valleys filled with smoke, dust, flying red flags, sweaty faces, and various vehicles transporting materials. At that time, as the railway workers poured their hearts and sweat into this great artery day and night, they forgot everything personal, burning with the strong hope that the train would pass through the section they had built as soon as possible!
    What creates miracles is the will of the people, the labor of the people, and the beautiful ideals of the people.
    Among the famous female worker teams active on the construction site, there were mothers with children and young girls. They used the stones they crushed to pave the roadbed all the way from Chengdu to Tanjiazhuang in Gansu. During a period of severe challenges, a female worker from Zigong, Sichuan, received a letter from her child one day saying:
    "Mom, you've been away from home for three years, why haven't you come back to your hometown? Why are you so busy?"
    How should she answer her child's longing? The female worker thought and thought, and later, from the stones she was using to pave the roadbed, she selected more than a dozen beautiful flower stones and sent them back to her hometown in a package. In her letter to her child, she proudly said:
    "Child! Mom is busy using these flower stones to pave the road to Beijing!"
    The high consciousness and extraordinary labor of the railway construction heroes have established immortal merit for the future generations of the motherland. "Let the high mountains bow their heads! Let the rivers give way!" Shouting the slogan of revolutionary heroism, they successively split thousands of mountain peaks, tunneled through 304 tunnels totaling 84,428 meters in length, excavated and filled 68.77 million cubic meters of roadbed earth and rock, and erected 981 large and small bridges over the surging rivers. On average, there is a tunnel every two kilometers and a bridge and a half every kilometer. Such a huge and arduous project is not only unprecedented in China, but also rare in the history of railway construction in the world!
    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway is also a comprehensive school of science and technology. Here, people are building and learning. In the complex bridge, tunnel, and roadbed projects, more than 18,000 engineering and technical personnel, management cadres, and skilled workers have grown rapidly. Peasants have become workers, soldiers have become engineering team leaders, and many people who were originally completely laymen have now become both red and expert specialists. Once, when I was talking to Chief Engineer Pan, he also mentioned this point:
    "In the process of building this railway, my deepest feeling is the rapid growth of people. With the help and guidance of Soviet experts, a large number of new and old cadres have mastered railway engineering technology. This is the greatest harvest we have gained in building the railway."
    Passing through Lingguan Gorge, Monkey Rock, and Pipa Cliff, the train runs along the towering peaks, through one tunnel after another. Miracles appear in the gorge. Here, three kilometers out of every four kilometers of the line are tunnels. Although there is already a railway here, it is difficult to see any trace of the railway from the outside. Seeing this marvelous project, the passengers all praised the tunnel builders. It is said that when the railway workers first came here, the mountain was too high to climb, and everyone was so anxious that they just stared blankly. At this time, Communist Party member Zhang Xikui was the first to step forward. He said:
    "Communist Party members must do things that others cannot do!"
    Saying that, he picked up an axe and a rope and climbed up the steep cliff, more than 60 meters high, like an ivy, tying the first rope for the railway construction army. The workers then pulled on this rope, split open the rock, and excavated the current tunnel.
    When the train arrived at Shifengzhou, many passengers got off to visit this large station hub, which will soon be electrified. On the spacious station yard and the crisscrossing tracks, there were many carriages loaded with equipment, goods, cotton, oil, and grain. As the largest freight transfer station between the Qinling and Daba Mountains, this place handles tens of thousands of tons of equipment, grain, and goods every month. Since the opening of temporary operations, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has been running seven pairs of passenger and freight trains every day, transporting an average of more than 3,000 passengers and more than 9,000 tons of goods. Over the past year, more than 900,000 tons of machinery, construction materials, and oil have been transported into Sichuan from other places by rail, and a large amount of grain, native products, and live pigs have also been transported out of Sichuan, with grain alone amounting to more than 640,000 tons.
    Climbing dangerous cliffs with hands reaching for the sky,
    Waist wrapped in ropes, suspended in the air;
    Splitting open fierce mountains to open roadbeds,
    Filling in gullies as plains.
    As the train climbed the Qinling Mountains with a panting breath, following the "8"-shaped mountain road, in the clouds and mist, sometimes to the left, sometimes to the right, sometimes forward, sometimes backward, I remembered this heroic poem written by the workers themselves. With the spirit of revolutionary optimism and the great courage to move mountains and overturn seas, they used large blasts to cut off rocks as high as fifteen stories on the 1,200-meter-high Bluestone Cliff, opening up a station in the clouds and mist. Between the cliffs facing each other on Songshupo, they built a stone arch bridge with a span of 38 meters like a ribbon. The five-li-long Qinling Grand Tunnel has a tall arch, bright lights, and is like a magnificent underground palace. In the Qinling Mountains, the length of such end-to-end "tunnel groups" accounts for almost 80% of the line. Traveling here, even during the day, it is rare to see the sky and the sun!
    Seeing these magnificent and ingenious projects, the passengers all praised:
    "We should thank those heroes who built the railway, we should erect monuments to them in the Qinling Mountains and the Daba Mountains!"

    昨天和今天
    ——宝成铁路见闻
    本报记者　纪希晨
    冬夜。从成都到西安的直达快车，驶过绿茫茫的川西平原，进入黑沉沉的大巴山谷时，速度渐渐减缓了下来。寂静、困倦……伴着车轮的有节奏的响声，许多旅客都摇摇晃晃地睡着了。这时，只有一位五十多岁的老太太不时地从车窗玻璃上抬起头，焦急地向人说：
    “到剑门关了吗？”
    “没有。”
    “劳驾你，到的时候，千万要喊我一声！”
    说罢，她围了围头巾，又伏身到玻璃上，不安地注视着车外的黑暗。
    她是谁？她为什么老是惦念着剑门关？怀着这样的好奇心，我同她攀谈起来，并直接了当地告诉她说，火车虽过剑门山区，但是不过剑门关。假若在白天，你也许能在车上远远看见“剑门七十二峰”，可是，现在什么也看不见。不料我这么一说，她竟难过得掉下泪来。
    “其实，不看心里倒还轻松些，看了反倒会更难过……”
    “那为什么？”
    “我老家在山东，抗战开始逃来四川。那时候，不光没有火车，就是马车也找不见……孩子他爹带着我们四口人，从宝鸡走了十多天才来到剑门关。山真高呀！有一天，正翻山，他爹猛不防滑了一跌，一个三岁的孩子，从扁担箩筐里滚下了山崖，连尸首都没有看见……”
    蜀道上，像这种摔人翻车的事，过去不知道发生过多少件。那壁立的岩峰，深不见底的谷涧，悬空的栈道，山洪的激流，几千年来，一直横阻在旅客的面前。为着征服秦蜀天险，我们的祖先虽曾付出巨大的代价，但多少朝代以来，蜀道仍然是“难于上青天”。可是今天，筑路工人却用自己的双手，在短短五年中，实现了我国人民几千年的心愿。在那“黄鹤之飞尚不得过”的地方，宝成铁路联通了川陕，游龙似的火车，正腾云驾雾一般，奔驰过河谷和群山，把无数物资和旅客，运往祖国的南北各地。谈到这天翻地复的变化，老太太笑了起来：
    “是呀！过去的日子，永远不会再有了。你看我，现在不是也坐着火车去探望老家吗？”
    这时候，忽然窗外有一片耀眼的灯光，机器的轰响和工人的号子声，传进温暖恬静的车箱。这是什么？是热闹的城市，还是新建的工厂？不，不是。这儿是奔腾的嘉陵江、白龙江，是大量坍方、滑坡的马蹄湾、杜家坝、谈家庄，是苍鹰也难飞过的手攀崖、琵琶崖，是风雪交加的秦岭。为保证列车平稳地驰过这些地区，成千上万的工人，带着钻探机、风钻和镐锨，夜以继日地战斗在河谷里、山岗上，打直井，开横洞，修明洞，砌起护坡和挡土墙，清除了大量的流砂、滑坡和坍方。
    在整治二千一百三十六处崩塌、冲刷、滑坡的病害中，工人们表现了极大的坚韧和顽强。正如白水江车站工地上的一位工人所说的：抢修坍方就像战场上打反冲锋那样，每一段流泥和坍方，都要经过反复几十次几百次的争夺和进攻，修了又塌，塌了再修，直到崩塌滑动的山岳大地变得服贴安宁，线路工程改善得更加坚固优良的时候，人们才转移向别的地方。正因为这样，去年即使遇到了二十年未有的洪水和暴雨，全线也没有发生较长时期中断行车的现象。
    “前面是谈家庄、黄沙河！”
    “1956年宝成线的南北接轨点！”
    列车员的声音，引起我无数的回想。望着那熟悉的工棚，山腰的村庄和隧道里的灯光，我目不转睛地寻找着钉下最后一颗道钉的地方。记得一年半以前，在迎接“七一”接轨的日子里，这一带的峡谷，仿佛变成了具有决定意义的战场。上下一千多里的工地上，十万劳动大军奋勇地忘我劳动着。不论是酷热的白天或者洪水暴涨的晚上，硝烟迷漫、尘土遮日的河谷里，到处是飘扬的红旗，炸山的炮声，淌着汗水的脸孔，以及各种运输材料的车辆。那时候，当筑路工人日夜用自己的心和血汗，浇铸着这条大动脉的时候，他们忘记个人的一切，强烈地燃烧着一个希望：让列车早日通过我修筑的地段！
    创造奇迹的是人的意志，人的劳动，和人的美好的理想。
    活跃在工地上的著名的女工大队里，有带孩子的妈妈，也有年青的姑娘。她们用自己敲碎的石子，把路基一直从成都铺到甘肃谈家庄。在严重考验的日子里，一个来自四川自流井的女工，一天，忽然接到孩子的来信说：
    “妈妈，你离家三年，为什么还不回故乡？你为什么那样忙？”
    到底用什么来回答孩子的渴望？女工想了又想，后来，就在她铺垫路基的石子里，拣选了十多颗美丽的花石头，用包裹寄回了故乡。她在给孩子的信中骄傲地说：
    “孩子！妈妈正忙着用这些花石头，铺平往北京的大道！”
    筑路英雄们的高度觉悟、不平凡的劳动，为祖国后代立下了千古不朽的功勋。“让高山低头！让河水让路！”喊着革命英雄主义的口号，他们先后劈开了成千的山头，鑿穿了三百零四座长达八万四千四百二十八公尺的隧洞，挖填了六千八百七十七万立方公尺的路基土石方，把九百八十一座大小桥梁，架设在汹涌的江流上。全线平均二公里多就有一座隧洞，一公里就有一座半桥梁。这样巨大艰险的工程，不仅在中国是空前的，就是在世界筑路史上也很少有！
    宝成铁路还是一所综合性的科学技术学校。在这里，人们建设着，学习着，在进行复杂的桥梁、隧洞、路基工程中，一万八千多个工程技术人员、管理干部和技术工人迅速得到了成长。农民变成了工人，战士变成了工程队长，许多人原来根本是外行，现在变成又红又专的专家了。一次，我和潘总工程师谈话的时候，他也谈到了这点：
    “修筑这条铁路的过程中，我最深切的感觉是人的迅速的成长。在苏联专家的帮助指导下，大批新老干部掌握了铁路工程技术。这是我们筑路中得到的最大丰收”。
    穿过灵官峡、猴子岩、琵琶崖的时候，列车沿着摩天的山峰，穿过一个个的隧洞。奇迹出现在峡谷中。这里四公里的线路就有三公里是隧洞。虽然这儿已经有了铁路，可是从外面却很难看到铁路的影踪。看了这神妙的工程，旅客们都连声称赞那些开山工。据说，最初筑路工人来到这里，因为山太高，爬不上去，急得大家干瞪眼睛。这时候，共产党员张喜魁首先挺身出来。他说：
    “共产党员就是要办别人办不到的事情！”
    说着，他拿起一把斧子、一条绳子，像爬墙虎似的，沿着峻峭的悬崖登上六十多公尺高的岩顶，为筑路大军拴起第一根绳子。工人们就拉着这条绳子，劈开石崖，修凿了现在的隧洞。
    车到石凤州，许多旅客都走下车来，参观这个不久就要电气化的大站纽。那宽敞的站场和交错的股道上，停放着许多满载器材、货物、棉花、石油和粮食的车箱。作为秦岭巴山间的最大货物转运站，此地每月都要吞吐十数万吨器材、粮食和货物。自从开办临时营业以后，宝成铁路每天要对开七列客货列车，平均运送三千多旅客，九千多吨货物。一年来，从外地经铁路运入四川的机器设备、建设材料和石油达九十多万吨，而从四川运出的粮食、土产和生猪也很多，其中仅粮食即达六十四万多吨。
    脚登险崖手攀天，
    腰缠绳索空中悬；
    劈开凶山开路堑，
    填起沟谷当平原。
    当列车气喘嘘嘘地爬上秦岭，沿着“8”字形的盘山道，在云雾里，一时向左，一时向右，一时向前，一时向后的行进时，我又记起了工人们自己写的这首豪迈的诗篇。他们用革命乐观主义的精神，以移山倒海的伟大魄力，在拔海一千二百公尺高的青石崖，用大爆破削掉了十五层楼那样高的岩石，开拓了云雾里的车站。在松树坡两山对峙的悬崖间，像飘带一样砌起跨度三十八公尺的石拱大桥。长达五华里的秦岭大隧道，有高大的拱顶、明亮的灯光，仿佛是一座壮丽的地下宫。在秦岭上，这样首尾相接的“隧道群”的长度，几乎占到线路的80％。旅行在这里，即使在白天，也难得看见天空和太阳！
    看了这些规模宏伟、巧夺天工的工程，旅客们都赞叹地说：
    “应该感谢那些筑路的英雄们，应该在秦岭、在大巴山上给他们树立起纪念碑！”
