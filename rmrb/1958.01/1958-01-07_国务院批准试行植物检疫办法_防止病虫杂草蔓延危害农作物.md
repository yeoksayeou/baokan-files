The State Council Approves Trial Implementation of Plant Quarantine Measures
Preventing Diseases, Pests, and Weeds from Spreading and Endangering Crops

    (Our report) The "Domestic Plant Quarantine Trial Measures" have been approved by the State Council and will be implemented nationwide on a trial basis from January 1, 1958. Implementing plant quarantine can prevent dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds that harm crops from spreading along with plants and plant products, and is one of the fundamental ways to combat crop diseases, pests, and weeds.

    The trial measures point out that after investigating and clarifying the occurrence of dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds in local areas, local authorities should quickly establish a plant quarantine system and prevent these diseases, pests, and weeds from continuing to spread through quarantine inspection and other measures. Areas where these diseases, pests, and weeds have not yet been discovered and vast newly reclaimed areas should be strictly protected to prevent the invasion of new diseases, pests, and weeds.

    The trial measures also stipulate that various seeds and seedlings should be inspected by plant quarantine agencies when provinces (autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government) adjust and introduce them to each other. Only after confirming that they do not carry plant quarantine objects or after thoroughly disinfecting seeds and seedlings carrying quarantine objects, can a plant quarantine certificate be issued before shipment. If agricultural and forestry colleges, experimental research departments need to introduce live, dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds that have not been discovered locally for experimental research purposes, they must report to the Ministry of Agriculture for approval in advance.

    In order to prevent the introduction of new diseases, pests, and weeds from foreign countries, the trial measures also stipulate that whenever it is necessary to introduce crop seeds, seedlings, and other sowing and propagation materials from foreign countries, the consent of the agricultural departments (bureaus) of the provinces (autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government) must be obtained in advance, and the plant quarantine certificate from the national plant quarantine authority of the exporting country must be obtained before they can enter the country.

    Plant quarantine work requires the close cooperation of many relevant departments and the support of the broad masses. Therefore, the trial measures require railway, transportation, postal and telecommunications, grain, agricultural product procurement, and supply and marketing departments to cooperate closely in carrying out this work.

    国务院批准试行植物检疫办法
    防止病虫杂草蔓延危害农作物
    本报讯　“国内植物检疫试行办法”已经国务院批准，由1958年1月1日起在全国试行。实行植物检疫可以防止为害农作物的危险性的病、虫、杂草随同植物和植物产品传播蔓延，是和农作物病、虫、杂草作斗争的根本办法之一。
    试行办法中指出：各地对发生在局部地区的危险性的病、虫、杂草，在经过调查，澄清发生情况之后，应该迅速建立植物检疫制度，通过检疫检验等措施，防止这些病、虫、杂草继续扩大蔓延；对尚未发现这些病、虫、杂草的地区和广大的新垦区，要严加保护，防止新的病、虫、杂草侵入。
    试行办法中还规定：各省（自治区、直辖市）间在互相调剂、引进各种种籽、苗木的过程中，都应该经过植物检疫机构的检验，证实没有携带植物检疫对象或对带有检疫对象的种子、苗木等经过彻底消毒处理后，发给植物检疫证书才能启运。各农林院校、试验研究部门，为了试验研究的目的，需要引进当地尚未发现的活的危险性的病、虫、杂草时，事前必须报农业部批准。
    为了防止从国外传入新的病、虫、杂草，试行办法中还规定：凡需由国外引进农作物种籽、苗木及其他播种繁殖材料时，都需在事前征得各省（自治区、直辖市）农业厅（局）或农业部门的同意，并取得输出国国家植物检疫机关的植物检疫证书后，才能入境。
    进行植物检疫工作，需要很多有关部门的密切配合和广大群众的支持，因此，试行办法要求铁道、交通、邮电、粮食、农产品采购、供销等部门在进行这一工作当中要密切合作。
