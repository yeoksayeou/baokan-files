    What to Pay Attention to When Using Aluminum Utensils?
    Yang Min
    Aluminum is often popularly called "steel essence." But in fact, it is not steel, nor is it iron. It simply belongs to the same category of metals as iron and steel.
    Aluminum can melt at 658 degrees Celsius. The temperature of the most intense part of an ordinary stove fire is often higher than this temperature. Therefore, when using aluminum cooking utensils, it is necessary to always keep an appropriate amount of water in the utensil, and never allow it to dry out, even for a moment, otherwise it will be burned. Therefore, aluminum cooking utensils are generally suitable for steaming and boiling; it is best not to use them for frying or stir-frying food.
    Caustic soda and aluminum cooking utensils are like water and fire. Aluminum utensils will quickly be corroded and develop holes upon contact with caustic soda. If it is necessary to remove dirt from aluminum utensils, only very dilute alkaline water can be used, and it must be rinsed several times quickly with clean water. However, it is best to use a solution of vinegar in water for cleaning, because vinegar can effectively remove dirt, and its corrosive effect on aluminum is much smaller.
    Although vinegar does not easily corrode aluminum utensils, long-term contact can also penetrate the walls. Therefore, food containing vinegar should not be stored in aluminum containers overnight.
    When aluminum utensils are new, they are as shiny as silver. However, after only a few days, they inevitably become dull and lose their luster, covered with a layer of greyish stuff; especially cooking utensils, the change is even more rapid. This greyish stuff is formed when aluminum comes into contact with oxygen in the air. If you wipe it off, the aluminum utensil can restore its shine, but soon, a second layer of aluminum oxide will quickly form again. If you simply let it tightly cover the aluminum utensil, it will not only protect the aluminum inside from continuing to oxidize, but also prevent food liquid from corroding the utensil.
    Aluminum utensils are very lightweight, and their thermal conductivity is second only to gold, silver, and copper. They also don't rust or shed rust like ironware. If we pay attention to these characteristics and properly protect them, that would be even better.

    用铝制器皿要注意些什么？

    铝，人们常常喜欢称它为钢精。其实它并不是钢，也不是铁，不过和铁、钢等物质同属于金属而已。
    铝在摄氏六百五十八度就可以熔解。而一般炉火的炽烈部分的温度，常常要比这个温度高。所以在使用铝制烹饪器皿的时候，器皿中必须经常保存适量的水，决不可让它有片刻的干枯，不然就会被烧坏。所以铝制烹饪器皿一般宜用于蒸煮，最好不要用它烙炒食物。
    烧碱和铝制烹饪器皿是水火不相容的。铝制器皿一触及烧碱，很快就会受到腐蚀，形成漏洞。如果需要清除铝制器皿上面的污垢，也只能用极稀淡的碱水，并且必须很快用清水复洗数次。但是最好是用食醋的水溶液来清洗，因为食醋既能有效地清除污垢，对铝的腐蚀作用又要小得多。
    食醋虽然不易腐蚀铝制器皿，但长期接触，也可以洞穿器壁。因此，带醋的食物，是不可用铝器贮存过夜的。
    铝制器皿在新的时候，光亮得像银子一般。可是，不多几天，便不免黯然失色，蒙上一层灰色的东西；尤其是烹饪器皿，变化更加迅速。这层灰色东西，是铝和空气中的氧气相接触而形成的。如果把它擦去，铝器虽可恢复光亮，但不久，第二层氧化铝很快又会形成的。如果干脆让它紧紧地蒙在铝器上，不但可以保护里面的铝不再继续氧化，同时还能防止食物液汁对器皿的侵蚀。
    铝制器皿很轻巧，导热的能力仅次于金、银、铜，也不像铁器那样不断生锈、掉锈。如果我们再注意到它那些特点，适当地加以保护，那就更好了。
