Asian and African continents are the cradles of human culture.
　As early as around the 40th century BC, the people of Asia and Africa created cultural life in the dawn of mankind on the vast continent and countless beautiful islands. On the banks of the Nile, in the Tigris and Euphrates river basins, in the Indus and Ganges river basins, in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, and in other parts of Asia and Africa, our ancestors created rich ancient cultures with their diligence and wisdom.

　Asian and African people mastered production knowledge very early on. We are primarily proud of the Egyptian people's contributions to world cultural history. The pyramids and Sphinx standing on the banks of the Nile silently testify to the amazing cultural achievements of the Egyptian people as early as four to five thousand years ago. The ancestors of the people of Arab countries also made significant contributions to world science and technology. In the Middle Ages, great Arab and Central Asian scholars summarized and developed the scientific knowledge of mankind at that time. We will always remember the names of these great figures with reverence: historians al-Tabari, al-Masudi, and Ibn Khaldun; geographers Ibn Hawqal and al-Maqdisi; astronomers and mathematicians al-Khwarizmi; chemist Jabir ibn Hayyan; especially the erudite great scientists Avicenna, al-Biruni, and al-Farghani, etc.

　As early as between 3000 and 2000 BC, the people of the Indus River valley already had advanced architectural technology and handicraft production technology, began to use metal production tools, and mastered irrigation knowledge. Ancient Indian scholars such as astronomers Aryabhata and Sushruta, and physicians Charaka, Sushruta and Vagbhata made brilliant contributions to world civilization in science and technology.

　Chinese people were already able to make exquisite painted pottery in the late Neolithic Age. Cultural relics left over from more than 3,500 years ago prove that the Chinese people at that time had outstanding achievements in construction, agriculture, and silk weaving. As early as 2,300 to 2,400 years ago, China had built a huge project—the Great Wall. In the first century AD, the Chinese people first invented papermaking, printing, and the compass. The Chinese scholar Zhang Heng invented the seismograph and the armillary sphere. In the fifth century, Zu Chongzhi discovered the value of pi, which was the closest to the correct value of pi in human history. In the sixteenth century, the "Compendium of Materia Medica" by the great Chinese pharmacologist Li Shizhen summarized the rich experience and knowledge of Chinese pharmacology.

　In terms of religion, philosophy, literature and art, the people of Asia and Africa have also enriched the world's cultural treasury with unparalleled labor and wisdom.

　The Long History of Cultural Exchange Between Asian and African Peoples

　The people of Asia and Africa have not only created brilliant cultures, but also have a long tradition of cultural exchange. The cultures of Asian and African countries have grown up in long-term mutual influence and mutual learning.

　As early as the sixth century BC, the people of Asia and Africa cut through thorns and thistles, opened up the world-famous "Silk Road," and started trade and cultural exchanges between the people of Asia and Africa. By the second century BC, the Chinese explorer Zhang Qian visited various countries in Central Asia and West Asia, further strengthening the cultural ties between this region and China.

　Although the official friendly cultural exchanges between China and Egypt began when the ships of the two countries visited each other in the sixth century AD, cultural exchanges had already sprouted through the "Silk Road." It was along this rainbow-like link, through the boundless ocean, that Arab astronomy, mathematics, and medicine were introduced to China. Islam also spread to China at this time. Chinese papermaking, printing, compass, silk weaving, and porcelain manufacturing also spread to countries in the Near and Middle East. In the sixth century AD, the Arab people sent more than 30 delegations to visit China, and the Arab King Mahdi also received a Chinese delegation.

　Glorious chapters of cultural exchange have also been left between Southeast Asian and South Asian countries. As early as the third century BC, the seeds of Indian culture and art began to be sown to many countries in Asia along with Buddhism. The cultural exchanges between China and India, the two major neighbors, are the most beautiful and moving poem. At that time, in order to spread culture and seek knowledge, monks and scholars of the two countries risked their lives and frequently visited each other through extremely difficult oceans, deserts, and high mountains. As for the history of cultural exchanges between China and Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Nepal, Ceylon, Afghanistan, and many other Asian and African countries, the same is true.

　However, the invasion of Western colonialists destroyed the peaceful life of the people of Asia and Africa and severed the friendly cultural ties between Asian and African countries. The people of Asia and Africa have successively suffered the same tragic historical fate. The light of Oriental culture was covered by the dark clouds of Western colonialism.

　A New Page in Cultural Exchange Between Asian and African Peoples

　After World War II, a series of Asian and African countries broke free from the shackles of colonialism and gained independence and freedom. Especially in recent years, the historical face of Asia and Africa has been renewed. Today, the friendly cultural ties between the people of Asian and African countries are consolidated and developed on this new foundation.

　The Bandung Conference in 1955 was a historical turning point in the friendly unity of Asian and African countries. Since then, under the inspiration of the "Bandung Spirit," the people of Asian and African countries have launched various cultural exchanges and friendly activities. In the past few years, Asian-African Student Conferences, Asian Writers Conferences, Asian-African Legal Workers Conferences, Asian Film Weeks, Arab Scientific Conferences, and Pan-Arab Games have been held in Asia and Africa. Asian and African countries also actively participated in the international expositions held in Damascus, Syria, and Casablanca, Morocco.

　Cultural cooperation between countries has also greatly developed in recent years. For example, my country has signed governmental cultural cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union, Egypt, Syria, North Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam, and signed non-governmental cultural exchange agreements with Japan. Egypt has signed governmental cultural cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Japan, and the Arab League countries. India has also signed cultural cooperation agreements with Iraq, Indonesia, Japan, and Iran; Indonesia has also signed cultural cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union, India, and Egypt. These agreements have promoted cultural exchanges between Asian and African countries.

　Mutual visits by art troupes have also become increasingly frequent. For example, outstanding Indian artists have visited and performed in the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, and Southeast Asian countries. Art performance groups from the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Burma, Japan, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Mongolia, North Korea, and other countries have visited China. In addition, my country has also received cultural delegations or cultural figures from Egypt, Syria, Pakistan, Ceylon, Nepal, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Sudan, Tunisia, the Federation of South Africa and other countries. Since the founding of New China, art troupes and cultural delegations have also been sent to visit more than a dozen Asian and African countries such as the Soviet Union, India, Burma, Egypt, Syria, Japan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nepal, Afghanistan, Sudan, Lebanon, Tunisia, Ethiopia, Vietnam, North Korea, and Mongolia. All these have further deepened the understanding and friendship between the people of Asia and Africa.

　Facts have proved that cultural exchange is an effective way to promote mutual understanding and friendship between the people of all countries, and it is also a positive means to strengthen world peace and international cooperation. Cultural exchanges between the people of Asia and Africa have brought beneficial effects to the entire international situation. We will work hard to further carry forward the fine tradition of cultural exchange between the people of Asia and Africa under more favorable historical conditions. We warmly welcome the significant achievements made by the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. This conference has made a resolution on cultural issues. The implementation of this resolution will undoubtedly play a significant role in promoting the culture of Asian and African nations and strengthening cultural exchanges among them.

    发扬亚非人民文化交流的优良传统
    杨慧琳
    亚非两洲是人类文化的摇篮
    早在公元前四十世纪左右亚非人民就在广阔的大陆和无数美丽的岛屿上创造了人类黎明时期的文化生活。在尼罗河两岸，在底格里斯河和幼发拉底河流域，在印度河和恒河流域，在黄河和长江流域，在亚非其他地方，我们的祖先以他们的勤劳和智慧创造了丰富的古代文化。
    亚非人民很早就掌握了生产知识。我们首先为埃及人民在世界文化史上的贡献而感到骄傲。耸立在尼罗河两岸的金字塔和狮身人面像无言地证明着埃及人民早在四、五千年前就有着惊人的文化成就。阿拉伯各国人民的祖先对世界科学技术也有重大贡献。在中世纪，阿拉伯和中亚的伟大学者们总结和发展了当时人类的科学知识。我们永远以崇敬的心情铭记着这些伟大人物的名字：历史学家太白里、马苏提和伊本·哈尔东；地理学家伊本·哈乌卡尔和马克提西；天文学和数学家花刺子密；化学家伊本·哈伊扬；特别是学识渊博的伟大科学家阿维森纳、比鲁尼和费尔加尼等。
    早在公元前三千年到二千年间，印度河流域人民就已有高度的建筑技术和手工业生产技术，开始使用金属制的生产工具，掌握了灌溉知识。印度古代学者如天文学家胁生、圣使，医学家恒知子、闍罗迦和妙闻等人在科学技术上对世界文明有过光辉的贡献。
    中国人民在新石器时代后期已经能制作精美的彩陶。三千五百多年前遗留下来的文物证明当时中国人民在建筑业、农业、蚕丝纺织业等方面就已有卓越的成就。远在二千三、四百年前，中国已建成了巨大的工程——万里长城。在公元一世纪时中国人民首先发明造纸法、印刷术和指南针。中国学者张衡发明了候风地动仪、浑天仪，五世纪时祖冲之发现了在人类历史上最接近于正确的圆周率。十六世纪时中国伟大的药物学家李时珍的“本草纲目”，总结了中国药物学的丰富经验和知识。
    在宗教、哲学、文学和艺术方面，亚非人民同样以无比的劳动和智慧丰富了世界文化的宝库。
    亚非人民文化交流的悠久历史
    亚非人民不但创造了光辉的文化，并且有着文化交流的悠久传统。亚非各国的文化正是在长期的互相影响、互相学习中成长的。
    早在公元前六世纪，亚非人民就披荆斩棘，开辟了世界闻名的“丝绸之路”，开始了亚非人民间的贸易文化来往。到公元前二世纪，中国探险家张骞又访问了中亚和西亚各国，进一步增强了这个地区和中国的文化联系。
    中国和埃及间的文化友好来往虽然正式开始于公元六世纪两国船只相互访问的时候，但文化交流早就通过“丝绸之路”而萌芽了。就是沿着这条彩虹一样的纽带，通过无边的海洋，阿拉伯人的天文学、数学、医学传入了中国。伊斯兰教也在这时传到了中国。中国的造纸术、印刷术、指南针、丝织、磁器制造等也流传到了中近东各国。在公元六世纪，阿拉伯人民曾派了三十几个使节团访问中国，阿拉伯国王马赫底也曾接见过中国代表团。
    在东南亚和南亚各国间，也同样留下了光辉的文化交流的史篇。早在公元前三世纪，印度文化艺术的种子就开始同佛教一起播种到亚洲许多国家。中国和印度这两大邻邦间的文化往来，是一首最美丽动人的诗篇。当时为了传播文化和求得知识，两国的高僧学者曾冒着生命危险，通过异常艰险的海洋、沙漠、峻岭高山，频繁地相互访问。至于中国和日本、朝鲜、越南、印度尼西亚、尼泊尔、锡兰、阿富汗及其他许多亚非国家间，都有着同样的文化交流的历史。
    但是，西方殖民者的入侵，破坏了亚非人民的和平生活，也扭断了亚非国家间的文化友好联系。亚非人民先后遭受了同样悲惨的历史命运。东方文化的光芒被西方殖民主义的乌云遮住了。
    亚非人民文化交流新的一页
    在第二次世界大战以后，一系列亚非国家挣脱了殖民主义的镣铐，取得了独立自由。特别是最近几年来，亚非的历史面貌已经为之一新。今天，亚非各国人民的文化友好联系就是在这一新的基础上巩固和发展起来的。
    1955年的万隆会议是亚非国家友好团结的历史的转折点。从那以后，亚非各国人民在“万隆精神”的鼓舞下，展开了各种各样的文化交流和友好活动。几年来在亚非两洲举行了亚非学生会议，亚洲作家会议，亚非法律工作者会议，亚洲电影周，阿拉伯国家科学会议，和泛阿拉伯运动会。亚非各国并且积极参加了在叙利亚的大马士革和摩洛哥的卡萨布兰卡举行的国际博览会。
    各国之间的文化合作几年来也有很大的发展。例如，我国和苏联、埃及、叙利亚、朝鲜、蒙古、越南都订立了政府性的文化合作协定，和日本订立了民间性的文化交流协议。埃及和苏联、中国、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦、阿富汗、日本、阿拉伯联盟国家都订立了政府性的文化合作协定。印度和伊拉克、印度尼西亚、日本、伊朗之间，印度尼西亚和苏联、印度、埃及之间，也都订立了文化合作协定。这些协定都促进了亚非各国间的文化交流。
    在艺术团相互访问方面也日益频繁起来。如印度优秀的艺术家们曾在苏联、中国、越南和东南亚各国访问演出。苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、日本、柬埔寨、泰国、越南、蒙古、朝鲜等国的艺术表演团都访问过中国。除此以外我国还接待过埃及、叙利亚、巴基斯坦、锡兰、尼泊尔、阿富汗、黎巴嫩、苏丹、突尼斯、南非联邦等国的文化代表团或文化人士。新中国建国以来也派遣了艺术团和文化代表团访问过苏联、印度、缅甸、埃及、叙利亚、日本、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦、尼泊尔、阿富汗、苏丹、黎巴嫩、突尼斯、埃塞俄比亚、越南、朝鲜、蒙古等十几个亚非国家。所有这些都进一步加深了亚非人民之间的了解和友谊。
    事实证明，文化交流是促进各国人民互相了解和友谊的有效途径，也是加强世界和平与国际合作事业的积极手段。亚非人民之间的文化交流已给整个国际局势带来有益的影响。我们将在更加有利的历史条件下，为进一步发扬亚非人民文化交流的优良传统而努力。我们热烈欢迎亚非人民团结大会取得的重大成就。这次大会已作出了关于文化问题的决议。这一决议的贯彻执行，对于繁荣亚非各民族文化和加强相互间的文化交流，无疑将会起着重大的作用。
