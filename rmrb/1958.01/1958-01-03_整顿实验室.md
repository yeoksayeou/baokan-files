    Rectifying Laboratories
    He Chuan
    The laboratory is the main base for schools to carry out teaching and scientific research, and it is also the main place for teachers and students to connect theory with practice. The quality of laboratory work has a significant impact on the speed and quality of the school's central tasks. Precisely for this reason, the state invests heavily in this area. In implementing the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily, rectifying laboratory work should become a key focus.
    Based on inspections of laboratory work in several institutions of higher learning, waste is serious. Why does such serious waste occur? On the one hand, it is due to the needs of teaching, and the laboratories have developed rapidly, with insufficient experience among staff. But the more important reason is that schools and leaders at all levels lack the spirit of running schools diligently and thriftily, do not pay attention to conservation, and one-sidedly seek more, bigger, more complete, and newer things without going deep into the lower levels. Some teachers also do not value practice, look down on labor, and disregard the connection between theory and practice. Of course, we have also seen many laboratories that pay attention to conservation, tap potential, and manufacture equipment themselves. Everyone should emulate them.
    The rectification of laboratories has significant political significance and is a profound socialist ideological education on building the country and running schools diligently and thriftily. In the work of rectifying laboratories, it is necessary to draw a clear line between socialism and capitalism in teaching work, and launch a struggle between the two lines. In the upsurge of rectification in various institutions of higher learning, it is necessary to deeply mobilize the masses, criticize various erroneous ideas through socialist great debates, overcome bureaucratic work styles, and strengthen management systems and the sense of responsibility of staff. Through the work of rectifying laboratories, all teachers and students should establish a style of learning that is diligent and thrifty, hardworking and simple, and connects theory with practice.

    整顿实验室
    何传
    实验室是学校进行教学和科学研究的主要阵地，也是教师和学生理论联系实际的主要场所。实验室工作的好坏，对于学校的中心任务完成的速度和质量起着重大影响。正因为这样，国家在这方面的投资很大。在贯彻勤俭办学的方针中，整顿实验室工作应成为一个重点。
    根据几个高等学校检查实验室工作的情况来看，浪费是严重的。为什么发生严重的浪费呢？一方面是由于教学上的需要，实验室发展得很快，工作人员的经验不足；而更主要的原因在于学校和各级领导缺乏勤俭办学的精神，不注意节约，片面地求多，求大，求全，求新，而不深入下层；还有些教师不重视实践，轻视劳动，轻视理论联系实际。自然，我们也看到不少实验室注意节约，发掘潜力，自造设备的情况。大家应该向他们看齐。
    实验室的整顿工作具有重大的政治意义，是一次深刻的勤俭建国、勤俭办学的社会主义思想教育。在整顿实验室的工作中，要划清教学工作中的社会主义和资本主义的界限，展开两条路线的斗争。各高等学校在整改高潮中，有必要深入发动群众，通过社会主义大辩论，批判各种错误思想，克服官僚主义作风，加强管理制度和工作人员的责任心。通过整顿实验室的工作，让全体师生树立起克勤克俭、艰苦朴素、理论联系实际的学风。
