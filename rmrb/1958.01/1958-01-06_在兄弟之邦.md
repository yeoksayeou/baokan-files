    In Fraternal Countries
    Soviet Artificial Climate Station
    North of Moscow, there is a place where it is always like the four seasons, whether in winter or summer. This place is the newly established artificial climate station. The station is conducting complex work, using scientific experiments to increase agricultural production.
    In the laboratories of the artificial climate station, various climate conditions are created for plant growth. It can create severe cold and scorching heat, as well as a warm spring and a cool autumn. Climate changes throughout the station are controlled by a central automatic dispatch room.
    In one large laboratory, there are many large refrigerator-like cabinets containing various crops for testing their cold resistance. The temperature in the cabinets can be lowered to minus seventy degrees.
    In another large laboratory, many incandescent lamps are installed under a glass ceiling, and rows of bright lights are installed along the walls. Therefore, the plants here can get a lot of heat and light.
    Valuable results have been obtained from the experiments here. For example, chemical agents have been found to promote and delay plant growth, and methods have also been found to prevent potatoes from growing tubers during storage. (See picture on the right)
    Sweet Vietnamese "Tuy Hoa Sugar Cane"
    Vietnam Democratic Republic had an unprecedented sugarcane harvest last year, with an average sugarcane yield of 30,000 kg per hectare, while Henan Province, which is rich in sugarcane, harvested 40,000 kg per hectare. According to the average output, it not only exceeded the previous year, but also increased by 43% compared with the highest year before the war in 1939. The main reason for the bumper harvest is the active promotion by the Republic government and the farmers' improvement of planting techniques. Last year, farmers in Henan and Hedong provinces also increased the planting of "Tuy Hoa Sugar Cane," which originally grew in the south. This kind of sugarcane has particularly thick and long stalks, and its sugar content is also higher than that of ordinary sugarcane.
    New Orders for Yugoslav Shipyards
    Yugoslav shipyards have now accepted orders for 116 ships of various types, totaling 865,000 tons, which will be completed by the end of 1962. Among them, 64 ships are being built for foreign owners, with a total tonnage of approximately 500,000 tons, worth approximately US$180 million.
    In the construction of these ships, Yugoslav shipyards used a large number of equipment manufactured by domestic industries, so the import of this equipment has gradually decreased. The Yugoslav Turbine Engine Factory and the Uljanik Shipyard in Pula have supplied giant ocean-going vessels. Yugoslav steel factories are also increasing the production of ship side steel plates. Domestic electrical appliance companies are preparing to produce a complete set of ship electrical equipment.

    在兄弟之邦
    苏联的人造气候站
    莫斯科北部的一个地方，无论是冬天或夏天，那里永远有四季的气候。这个地方就是不久以前新成立的人造气候站。这个站进行着复杂的工作，用科学试验来提高农业产量。
    在人造气候站的各试验室里，为植物的生长创造了各种不同的气候条件。这里能制造严寒和酷暑，也能制造和暖的春天和凉爽的秋天。站里各处的气候变化由一个总的自动调度室操纵。
    在一个大试验室里有很多大冰箱式的橱柜，里面放着各种农作物，以便试验它们的耐寒性。橱柜里的温度可以降到零下七十度。
    在另一间大试验室里，在玻璃的天花板下面安设了很多白热电灯，沿着墙壁安装了一排排光线很强的电灯。因此，这里的植物可以得到大量的热和光。
    这里的试验已经获得宝贵的成果。例如，已找到促进和延缓植物生长的化学药剂，还找到了防止土豆在储藏期间生长块茎的办法。（见右图）
    甜美的越南“绥和甘蔗”
    越南民主共和国去年甘蔗空前丰收，平均每公顷甘蔗产量达到三百公担，而盛产甘蔗的河南省每公顷竟收四百公担。按平均产量计算，不仅超过了前年，而且比战前最高年份1939年也增加了43％。丰收的主要原因是由于共和国政府积极提倡以及农
  民改进了种植技术。河南、河东省农民去年还增种了原来生长在南方的“绥和甘蔗”，这种甘蔗茎特别粗长，含糖量也比一般甘蔗多。
    南斯拉夫造船厂的新订货
    南斯拉夫造船厂现已接受一百一十六艘各式轮船的订货，总计八十六万五千吨，将于1962年底完成。其中六十四艘为国外货主建造的，其总吨位约为五十万吨，约值一亿八千万美元。
    在建造这些船只中，南斯拉夫造船厂使用了国内工业制造的大批设备，因此这种设备的进口逐渐减少，南斯拉夫透平机工厂和普拉的尤尔也热克造船厂已经供应巨型远洋船只。南斯拉夫钢铁工厂同时增加生产船侧钢板。国内电机企业准备生产全套船用电器设备。
