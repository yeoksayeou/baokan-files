Raising Goldfish

Whenever you see those floating, carefree, colorful, and crystal-clear goldfish, your heart will be filled with many beautiful and touching memories and fantasies. How many painters have painted them, and how many poets have written poems for them!

The ancestors of goldfish were originally a kind of wild crucian carp that was golden in color, with a short body and small tail. It is said that it was first discovered in the rivers and ditches of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, in our country. As a result of many years of breeding and cultivation, and changes in the living environment, its shape and living habits have gradually changed. Its swimming speed has decreased due to many years of living in calm water; its shape has gradually developed from a long body and small tail to a thick body and large tail. After artificial breeding and selection, the variety and shape of goldfish have undergone even greater changes, becoming much more beautiful than their ancestors – crucian carp.

Since liberation, due to the general improvement of the people's material and cultural standards, the cause of raising goldfish has had greater and newer development. Before liberation, it was said that there were only seventy-two varieties of goldfish, but now, it has developed into one hundred and fifty-four varieties. It is estimated that this year, it can be developed to at least one hundred and eighty varieties. The activity of raising goldfish has also changed from the pastime of wealthy families, nobles, and rich merchants before liberation to a common and proper cultural and entertainment activity for the working masses.

Goldfish have a very long lifespan. There are some in the goldfish pond in Zhongshan Park in Beijing that have been raised for more than twenty years.

The living habits of goldfish vary with the change of climate. Every time spring arrives, when the trees just sprout tender buds, they wake up from hibernation and begin to float on the surface of the water. In such a beautiful spring, don't think that it has been hungry for a long time after a long period of hibernation, and therefore give it a lot of food. After hibernation, goldfish are just like people who have been sick for a long time, wanting to eat but not being able to eat much. In early spring, the weather is still relatively cool, so it is more appropriate to change the water for the goldfish in the afternoon. The amount of water changed should also be determined by the temperature. When it is cold, only two or three tenths can be changed, and then increased to three or four tenths. Summer is the time when goldfish have a better appetite, so they should be given more food. In summer, the water should also be changed frequently to prevent the water from spoiling. Autumn is the time when goldfish begin to grow fat, and their appetite is bigger than at any other time. When feeding fish food, try to meet its requirements so that it grows strong and prepares for winter. When the cold winter arrives, the goldfish begin to hibernate. They do not like to move or eat. At this time, special care should be taken to avoid making it too cold or too hot. If not properly cared for, goldfish are prone to illness.

Fish cannot survive without water. If goldfish are kept in unclean or excessively warm water, they will not be able to survive either. When the water in the goldfish bowl is turbid, or when the goldfish are seen floating to the surface of the water and breathing fresh air with their heads facing outwards, this means that the water is not clean or fresh, and new water should be replaced immediately. Goldfish are most suitable for living in well water, because well water contains minerals that are good for the growth of goldfish. If tap water is used to raise goldfish, it must be water that has been exposed to the sun or left for a long time, because a type of chlorine in tap water will affect the health of the goldfish. Rainwater is the least suitable for raising goldfish, because rainwater contains a lot of dirt.

Goldfish like to eat plankton. There is a kind of mosquito larvae called *孑孓* (jiéjué), which goldfish love to eat most. It is easy to digest and can also keep the basin water clean. A small amount of cooked egg yolk, pasta, and other soft foods can also be used to replace *孑孓* (jiéjué), but these foods can easily spoil the water in the fish tank.

It is best to use a wooden basin to raise goldfish, because green moss easily grows at the bottom of the wooden basin, which is suitable for goldfish to live in. Of course, wooden basins are not as beautiful as glass tanks. If using a glass tank, a layer of river sand or small pebbles should be laid on the bottom of the tank, and some aquatic plants should be placed in it, so that the goldfish can live well.

If the goldfish's living conditions are not well taken care of, it is easy to get sick. The most common diseases are "bubble disease," "gill rot disease," and "tilting disease," etc. The reasons for these diseases are often abnormal or unclean water temperature, or improper supply of fish food.

    养金鱼
    每当你看到那浮游自得、五彩晶莹的金鱼，你的心灵深处会涌现出许多美丽动人的回忆和幻想。有多少画家为它作画，有多少诗人为它赋诗啊！
    金鱼的祖先，原来是一种呈金黄色、身长尾小的野生鲫鱼。据说，它最初在我国浙江杭州的河沟中被发现。经过多少年代饲养培育的结果，生活环境的改变，它的形态以及生活习惯渐渐起着变化。它的浮游速度，由于多年在平静的水面生活因而降低；它的形状由长身小尾而逐渐往身粗尾大的方向发展。又经过人工繁殖、选种等办法，金鱼的品种和形态起了更大的变化，比它的祖先——鲫鱼美丽得多了。
    解放以后，由于人民群众物质文化水平的普遍提高，饲养金鱼的事业，有了更大更新的发展。解放以前，金鱼的品种据说只不过七十二种，到如今，已经发展成为一百五十四个品种了。估计到今年，至少可发展到一百八十个品种。养金鱼的活动，也由解放前的那些豪门贵族、富商公子的消遣活动，改变成为劳动群众的普遍的正当文化娱乐活动了。
    金鱼的寿命很长，在北京中山公园的金鱼池里就有已经养育了二十多年的。
    金鱼的生活习惯，随着气候的变化有所不同。每当春季到来，树木刚吐露出嫩芽的时候，它便从冬眠中醒来，开始往水面上浮游。在这样美好的春天，你不要以为它经过漫长的冬眠时间，已经饿得很苦了，因而给它大量的食物。金鱼冬眠过后，也正像人们生过一段长时间的病一样，想吃而不能多吃。初春的时候，天气还比较凉，因此给金鱼换水的时间放到下午比较适宜，换水的量，也要随气温的高低而定，天冷时，只能换十分之二、三，然后增到十分之三四。夏季是金鱼的胃口比较好的时节，应当多给它些食物。夏天还应该给金鱼勤换水，防止水的腐坏。秋天是金鱼开始长得肥胖的时候，它的胃口比任何时候都大，在喂鱼食时要尽量满足它的要求，使它生长健壮，准备过冬。当天寒地冻的冬天到来的时候，金鱼即开始冬眠，它既不爱活动，也不爱饮食了。这时，尤其要注意不使它太冷或太热，如果护理不好，金鱼很容易生病。
    鱼离开了水是不能生存的。如果让金鱼生活在不洁净或温度过高的水里，它也是生活不下去的。当金鱼缸里的水浑浊时，或者发现金鱼浮出水面头向外叭叭地呼吸新鲜空气时，这就是说，水已不清洁或者是不新鲜了，这时应立即换新水。金鱼最适宜生活在井水里，因为井水含有矿物质，宜于金鱼的生长。如果用自来水养金鱼，必须是经过日晒或放了很久的水。因为自来水内含的一种氯气会影响金鱼的健康。雨水是最不宜于养金鱼的，因为雨水里含有很多脏物。
    金鱼喜爱吃食浮游动物，有一种孑孓，金鱼最爱食它。它易于消化，还能保持盆水清洁。用少量的熟鸡蛋黄、面食等软食，也可以代替孑孓，但这些食物，容易使鱼缸里的水腐坏。
    养金鱼最好用木盆，因为木盆底容易生绿毛苔，适宜金鱼生活。当然，木盆没有玻璃缸美观。如果用玻璃缸，就需要在缸底铺一层河沙或细石子，再放一些水草，这样，金鱼才能生活得很好。
    金鱼的生活料理得不好，很容易生病。一般常见的几种病，是“气泡病”、“腮腐病”和“歪倒病”等。产生这些疾病的原因，很多是因为水温不正常、不清洁，或者是鱼的食物量供给不当。
