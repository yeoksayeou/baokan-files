The Nameless Barren Mountain Got a Name
By our reporter Li Lianbin

I.
At one end of the barren mountain, rows of brand-new brick houses stand neatly. These are pigsties. I saw someone feeding the pigs from afar. This person was wearing a faded blue-gray cloth suit, with a white apron tied around his waist, facing away from me. After he added the pig slop, put the slop bucket aside, and went to the pig exercise area to clean up the pig manure. I walked up to him and saw a pair of bright eyes embedded in his wrinkled face. I was stunned and couldn't help but exclaim:

"Ah! Director Quan!"

He stared at me for a long time, recognized me, vigorously shook his hands, and ran towards me. He stretched out his hand but then retracted it, smiling and saying:

"My hands are too dirty, let's skip the handshake!"

I had met Director Quan once in the General Office of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee. At that time, he was wearing a dark blue wool serge Zhongshan suit, and his hands were spotless. Today, he was picking up manure.

He pointed to one small brick house after another, telling me: this is the First Pig Farm, that is the Second Pig Farm, that is the Third Pig Farm... Pointing to a tall building of green bricks and tiles, he told me it was a grain warehouse. I was amazed that there was actually a grain warehouse on this barren mountain. He pointed to the endless barren mountain and said:

"This barren mountain feeds thousands of pigs." How could this barren land feed thousands of pigs? I looked at him with questioning eyes. He understood what I meant, and he said:

"Come with me." He took me to the cabbage field, then to the radish field, then to the sweet potato field, and then to the rice field, saying:

"It is these things that feed those pigs."

I asked, "Did you reclaim this wasteland?"

"We reclaimed it. These fields feed those pigs, and those pigs also feed this barren mountain."

"How can pigs feed a barren mountain?"

"Look at how well these cabbages, radishes, and sweet potatoes are growing, all thanks to pig manure. Pigs are living fertilizer-making machines."

II.
Just as dawn was breaking, before the first hint of light appeared, I saw Director Quan busy in the room. His sleeves were rolled up, and his arms were constantly adding firewood to the stove. In the light from the stove, I unexpectedly discovered that he had bullet scars on his legs and arms. My calm heart was stirred. I wanted to know the origin of these bullet scars, but I was afraid of causing him painful memories. I moved closer to him, sat on the firewood, and asked him:

"What are you doing?"

"Boiling water. After the young men get up, I want them to drink a cup of hot tea first, to warm them up from the inside."

"Do you cook and heat the water yourselves?"

"Yes, we all do it ourselves."

A department director leaves the city, bids farewell to electric lights, running water, movie theaters, and desks, and comes to the barren mountains to reclaim wasteland, raise pigs, collect manure, and boil tea... Seeing him doing these things with such deep joy! We two sat by the stove, seeing the stove opening shining, the firewood creaking, the surroundings silent, people were still soundly asleep, it was a good time for heart-to-heart talks. I asked him to talk about the beginning and end of coming to this nameless barren mountain.

In September 1956, one day after the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Fang Zichun, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Governor, called Director Quan to his office and said to him kindly:

"There is a difficult job that needs you to do."

"Leader, no matter how difficult the job is, as long as the Party entrusts it to me, I will do it happily."

Comrade Fang Zichun was Director Quan's old leader and was very familiar with him. He knew that he would answer this way, so he directly said to him:

"I want you to advance into the barren mountains and set an example for the entire province."

"Okay, advancing into the barren mountains means advancing into the barren mountains."

"It's going to be difficult!" Fang Zichun said with emotion.

"Is it more difficult than fighting guerrilla warfare during the Second Revolutionary Civil War?" They both smiled knowingly. Fang Zichun continued:

"It won't be more difficult than that time, and we won't ask you to eat grass roots and gnaw tree bark again."

Quan Shengren, Director Quan's name, joined the Red Army as early as 1929 during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. He fought in the north and south for more than thirty years, and he is already forty-nine years old this year. He never bargains or complains about the tasks assigned by the Party. He asked:

"What is the name of the barren mountain?"

"It doesn't have a name yet, go and create it!" Fang Zichun replied in such a humorous and interesting way.

"Where is it?"

"It is in Dongxiang County, adjacent to Jinxian County. You can see that barren mountain from the train on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway."

The next day, Director Quan went to the area to be reclaimed alone. It turned out to be a vast, nameless barren mountain. The land was covered with purplish-red hills interspersed with golden-red soil. There wasn't even a single Masson pine. One valley after another, rising and falling, undulating. He walked in the valleys, as if floating in the sea, drifting with the waves.

He had sat on the train on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway many times and heard many passengers lament this endless barren mountain. Some compared it to a "scabby head"; others said: "A 'scabby head' is not as bad as this," there were various discussions, and the conclusion was the same: barren land. At that time, he thought: If this barren mountain could grow crops, how amazing it would be. He didn't expect that the Party would entrust this task to him. He was determined not to fail the Party's trust. However, the nearby masses told him that this barren mountain had never grown crops before. After liberation, the Gengxin Farm tried to grow crops here, but it failed. The Xin Dong Agricultural Cooperative also tried it, and also achieved the same result. He wavered.

After returning to Nanchang, he reported the situation to Comrade Fang Zichun. Comrade Fang Zichun said: "We won't ask you to do what our ancestors have done, or what others have successfully done."

Hearing this sentence, he was both happy and ashamed. He was happy because of the Party's trust in him, and ashamed of his lack of determination. The next day, he went to this vast barren mountain again. He wandered on the barren mountain for a long time, picked up a handful of soil with his hand, and thought to himself, how happy it would be to see this boundless wasteland grow crops, and how many people it could feed! He made up his mind to make this barren land grow crops. He went to the villages near the barren mountain to investigate and saw that in the red soil area, there were also black soil cultivated lands. This made him feel very strange. After asking many farmers, he finally understood: The soil can be transformed, as long as you apply more fertilizer, and continue to do so year after year, the red soil can also be turned into black soil, growing lush crops.

Once the method was found, he took two cadres from the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee, carrying luggage, and settled down in this barren mountain. They started a new life in a dilapidated house left by the Gengxin Farm, setting up a stove and cooking. Every day they went out to reclaim wasteland, while also husking rice, cooking food, chopping firewood, and taking care of everything. Comrade Quan Shengren was just as busy as the other comrades, but he thought more about the fertilizer problem. He bought eight pigs and applied the pig manure to the reclaimed wasteland, and then tried to plant crops such as cabbage and Chinese cabbage. He would go to check on them several times a day. When he saw the sturdy cabbage and Chinese cabbage growing bigger day by day, he was extremely happy.

III.
"His patience in raising pigs is like a mother loving her own child." This is what many people who reclaimed wasteland with Director Quan said about him. They told me many stories about Director Quan raising pigs. Every day, before dawn, when others were still dreaming, he would get up to cook pig feed, three times a day. At night, he was afraid that jackals would eat the pigs, or that big pigs would crush small pigs to death, so he would get up two or three times every night, carrying a carbine to patrol the pigsties. When small pigs couldn't get milk, he would bottle-feed them. When the sow was about to give birth, he would stay by the pig's side, for fear of accidents. When the sow was in heat, he would promptly mate the sow. They all believed that Director Quan was their model. Under the influence of Director Quan, all the feeders worked diligently, allowing the pigs to breed and grow smoothly. They originally had eight pigs, and later bought 300 more, and now they have bred to 3,000. The pig reproduction rate has reached its highest level, and the survival rate of piglets is also very high, reaching 96%. Last year, they had already sold 280 meat pigs, and in the future, there will be more meat pigs to supply market needs.

Their accountant said: After the living "fertilizer factory" was opened, the fertilizer problem was solved. Last spring, they also reclaimed 2,600 mu of wasteland, and the land grew cabbage, Chinese cabbage, sweet potatoes, millet, soybeans, and rice. Last autumn, on this barren mountain, a tall warehouse was built for the first time, filled with various grains, with 210,000 jin of rice alone.

The 3,000 pigs they raised ate the crops grown on this barren mountain, cabbage, Chinese cabbage, sweet potatoes, and soybeans all became pig feed; and the pig fertilizer changed the soil of the wasteland, allowing them to grow various crops. Without spending more national investment, mainly relying on their own hardworking hands, they have initially built a farm on a barren hill. Now, this farm has ten cadres sent down from above and 175 surplus rural and urban laborers. Under their efforts, the appearance of this barren mountain is rapidly changing.

IV.
I came to Director Quan's bedroom, he was wearing a woolen military uniform, looking like a senior military officer. I asked:

"Why are you wearing a military uniform?"

"This was issued in the army."

Speaking of the army, at my request, he showed me several bullet scars and knife wounds on his legs, abdomen, chest, and other places. I thought, how difficult it was for him to survive until today! "Today is not the time to enjoy life. I will take you around our entire barren mountain." Saying that, he stood up, and I walked with him. He told me:

"This place is going to be developed into a tea forest, and an orchard will be built there, planting oranges and pears; oil tea trees will be planted there." He spoke vividly, as if he smelled the fragrance of tea and tasted the sour sweetness of pears. He was just talking about plans, but it seemed as if he saw lush tea forests and orchards. He said:

"During the Second Five-Year Plan, we plan to reclaim 40,000 mu of wasteland. By 1967, we plan to reclaim all of this barren mountain of more than 100,000 mu into fertile land."

At this time, I heard the sound of motors. After crossing a valley, I saw several tractors reclaiming wasteland. He said:

"In 1956, we relied on people and cattle to reclaim wasteland. In 1957, we started using tractors." I gazed at the grain warehouse built on the barren mountain in a trance.

He pointed to the pigsties and said: "Like that pig farm, we plan to build six or seven during the Second Five-Year Plan, planning to raise 40,000 pigs; in 1967, we plan to raise 100,000 to 200,000 pigs, with an average of one pig fertilizing one mu of land, so that the harvest of the wasteland can be guaranteed."

He also said: "We plan to start raising sheep, dairy cows, and bees from 1958. Now we have raised dozens of Angora rabbits, and we plan to develop them on a large scale."

He became more and more excited as he spoke, and the floodgates opened: "Now the best buildings here, besides the grain warehouse, are the pigsties. In another ten years, we will build a small city on this barren mountain. By that time, there will be hospitals, clubs, electric lights, and auditoriums.

We walked forward and saw four large red characters: "Red Star Farm." He said: "This is our farm headquarters."

Ah! The nameless barren mountain got a name.

    无名荒山有了名
    本报记者　李连斌
    一
    在荒山的一端，崭新的砖瓦平房成行地排列着。这是猪舍。我远远地看见一个人在喂猪。这个人穿一身褪了色的蓝灰色的布衣，腰系一个白围裙，背向着我。他添好了猪馊，把馊筒放在一旁，就到猪运动场打扫猪粪。我走向他的面前，看见他那堆满皱纹的面孔上嵌着一双有神色的大眼睛，我怔住了，不由地喊出：
    “啊！全处长！”
    他凝视我好久，认出来是我了，他用力地甩两只手，向我跑了过来，他刚伸出手来又缩了回去，笑着说：
    “手太脏了，免了握手吧！”
    过去我在江西省人民委员会的办公厅里曾见过一次全处长，那时，他穿一身藏青色的毛哔叽中山装，两只手一尘不染，今天却抓起大粪来了。
    他指着一片一片的小砖房告诉我：这是第一养猪场，那是第二养猪场，那是第三养猪场……。指着一栋青砖青瓦的高大建筑物告诉我是粮食仓库。我惊叹荒山上居然有了粮食仓库。他指给我看那一眼望不到边的荒山说：
    “就是这块荒山养活了几千头猪。”这不毛之地，怎能养活几千头猪呢？我以询问的眼光望着他。他领会了我的意思，他说：
    “你跟我来。”他把我带到甘蓝地，又带到萝卜地，又带到红薯地，又带到稻田里，说：
    “就是这些东西养活了那些猪。”
    我问：“这是你们开的荒吧？”
    “是我们开的荒。这些地养活了那些猪，那些猪也养活了这片荒山。”
    “猪怎能养活荒山呢？”
    “你看这些甘蓝、萝卜和红薯生长得这样好，全靠猪粪了。猪就是活的造肥机器。”
    二
    天刚放亮，鱼肚白还没有出现的时候，就见全处长在房里忙碌着。他那挽起袖子的两只胳臂不时地向灶坑添柴，在灶口的光亮映照下，我意料之外地发现他腿上和胳臂上都有弹痕，我这平静的心为之一动。我想了解一下这弹痕的来由，但顾虑引起他的悲痛的回忆，我凑到他旁边坐在柴草上，问他：
    “你在作什么？”
    “烧开水，叫那些小伙子起床后，先喝一杯滚茶，从肚里暖和暖和。”
    “作饭烧水都你们自己动手呀！”
    “是，我们大家自己干。”
    一个处长离开城市，告别了电灯，告别了自来水，告别了电影院，告别了办公桌，来到荒山开荒、养猪、拾粪、烧茶……。看他作这些事有着多么深厚的乐趣呀！我们两人坐在灶旁，只见灶口闪闪发光，柴火吱吱作响，四周寂静，人们都正在酣睡，正是促膝长谈的好时机，我要求他谈一谈来到这无名的荒山的始末。
    1956年9月，党的第八次代表大会后的一天，中共江西省委书记兼副省长方志纯，把全处长叫到办公室，亲切地对他说：
    “有一个艰苦的工作需要你去作。”
    “首长，不管怎样艰苦的工作，只要党交给我，我就愉快地去作。”
    方志纯同志是全处长的老首长，对他非常熟悉，知道他会这样回答，就直接了当地对他说：
    “要你向荒山进军，给全省作出一个样子来。”
    “好，向荒山进军就向荒山进军。”
    “艰苦啊！”方志纯感叹地说。
    “难道比第二次国内革命战争时期打游击还艰苦吗？”他们二人会意地笑了。方志纯接着说：
    “再艰苦也不会比那时艰苦了，再不会叫你吃草根啃树皮了。”
    全处长名叫全胜仁，早在第二次国内革命战争时期的1929年就参加了红军，南征北战三十来年，今年已经四十九岁了。从来对党交给的任务不讲价钱不叫苦。他问：
    “荒山叫什么名字？”
    “还没有名字，你去创造吧！”方志纯这样幽默而有情趣地答。
    “在甚么地方？”
    “在东乡县境内，和进贤县相邻，坐在浙赣路的火车上就看见了那片荒山。”
    第二天，全处长独自一人到了要开垦的地方。原来是一块无名无边的大荒山，成片的土地都是紫红色夹带金红色的山丘，连一棵马尾松也没有，一个山谷连一个山谷，一起一伏此起彼伏，他在山谷中行走，好像漂浮在大海中，随着海浪而漂荡。
    他曾多次坐在浙赣路的火车上，听到多少旅客为这片无边的荒山惋惜，有人喻之为“癞痢头”；有人说：“癞痢头”也不如，议论纷纷，结论一个：不毛之地。他当时想：如果能叫这荒山长出庄稼来，该是多么了不起的事情。他没有想到：党把这个任务交给了他，他决心不辜负党的委托。但附近群众告诉他：这块荒山从来没有生长过庄稼。解放后更新农场在这里试种过庄稼，结果失败了，新东农业社也试验过，也获得同样的后果。他动摇了。
    返回南昌后，他向方志纯同志汇报了情况。方志纯同志说：“我们祖先作过的，别人作成功了的，就不叫你去作了。”
    听了这句话，他是又高兴又惭愧。高兴的是党对他的信任，惭愧的是自己的决心不足。第二天，他又到了这片大荒山。他在荒山上徘徊了许久，用手挖起一把土，心想要是看到这无边的荒丘长出庄稼来，那该是多么快意呀，能够养活多少人呀！他下决心，要叫这不毛之地长出庄稼来。他到靠近荒山的村子去考察，看见红壤土地带里，也有黑土的耕地。这使他感到很奇怪。在问过许多农民以后，他终于弄明白了：土壤是可以改造的，只要多施肥料，而且年复一年地这样下去，红土也能变成黑土，长出茂盛的庄稼来。
    办法找到了，他就带着江西省人民委员会的两个干部，扛着行李，到这片荒山安家落户了。他们在更新农场留下的一所破房子里，搭起锅灶开始了新的生活。每天出去开荒，同时自己淘米作饭，自己砍柴，照料一切。全胜仁同志和其他同志一样紧张，但是他脑子里考虑得更多的是肥料问题。他买了八头猪，把猪粪施到开垦了的荒地上，然后试种上甘蓝、白菜等作物。他每天去看管几次，当看见茁壮的甘蓝、白菜一天比一天长大起来，他真是高兴极了。
    三
    “他饲养猪的耐心，像母亲爱护自己的孩子一样。”这是很多和全处长一起开荒的人对他的评语。他们对我讲了许多全处长养猪的故事。每天天还不亮的时候，别人正在梦乡中，他就起来煮猪食，一天要喂三次。夜晚他怕豺狼把猪吃掉，或者大猪压死小猪，每夜要起来两三次，背着卡宾枪到猪舍巡视。小猪吃不到奶，他就给它把奶，母猪到了预产期，他就守在猪旁，唯恐发生事故。母猪到了发情期，他就及时地为母猪交配。他们都认为全处长是他们的模范，他们在全处长的影响下，全体饲养员都勤勤恳恳地工作，使猪顺利地繁殖和生长起来。他们原有八头猪，以后又买进三百头，现在已经繁殖到三千头。猪的繁殖率达到了最高度，小猪的成活率也很高，已经达到96％。去年，他们已经卖出二百八十头肉猪，今后还会有更多的肉猪供应市场需要。
    他们的会计说：活的“肥料工厂”开起来以后，肥料问题也就解决了。去年春季，他们又开垦了两千六百亩荒地，地里长出了甘蓝、白菜、红薯、黄粟、大豆和稻谷。去年秋天，在这片荒山上，第一次盖起了高大的仓库，堆满了各种粮食，只稻谷就有二十一万斤。
    他们养的三千头猪，吃到了这片荒山长出来的作物，甘蓝、白菜、红薯、大豆都成了猪的食料；而猪的肥料又改变了荒地的土壤，使它们长出了各种各样的庄稼。他们没有花费国家更多的投资，主要依靠自己勤劳的双手，已经在一片荒丘上初步建成了一个农场。现在，这个农场有下放干部十名，城乡剩余劳动力一百七十五人。在他们的努力下，这片荒山的面貌正在迅速改变着。
    四
    我来到了全处长的寝室，他穿着呢子军服，俨然一个高级军官。我问：
    “怎么穿起军装来了。”
    “这是在部队发的。”
    谈到部队，他在我的要求下，给我看了他腿部、腹部、胸部等几处弹痕和刀伤。我想他能活到今天多么不容易呀！“今天还不是享福的时候。我领你到我们整个荒山转一圈。”说着就站了起来，我跟他一齐走了。他告诉我：
    “这里准备开辟为茶林，那里建立果园，栽种柑桔、梨子；那里栽油茶。”他说得活灵活现，好像他闻到了茶叶的芬芳，尝到了梨的酸甜。他只是讲的计划，但仿佛他看见了茂盛的茶林和果园似的。他说：
    “第二个五年计划期间，打算开荒四万亩，到1967年，打算把这片十几万亩的荒山全部开垦为良田。”
    这时，我听到了马达的哒哒声，翻过一个山谷，果然看见几台拖拉机在开荒。他说：
    “我们1956年开荒靠人和牛，1957年就用上拖拉机了。”我遥望那座建在荒山上的粮食仓库出神。
    他的手指向猪舍说：“像那样的养猪场，第二个五年计划期间中准备建立六、七个，计划养猪四万头；1967年打算养猪十万到二十万头，平均一头猪肥一亩田，这样可保证荒地的收成。”
    他还说：“计划从1958年开始养羊、养奶牛、养蜂，现在养了几十只安格拉兔，准备大发展。”
    他越讲越兴奋，话匣子打开了：“现在这里最好的建筑物，除了粮食仓库，就是猪舍，十几年后，我们就在这荒山上建立一个小城市，到那个时候，医院、俱乐部、电灯、礼堂都有了。
    我们再向前走，看见了“红星农场”四个大红字。他说：“这是我们的场部。”
    啊！无名的荒山有了名。
