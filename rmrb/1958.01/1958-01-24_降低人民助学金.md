    Lowering People's Grants
    The state's decision to universally lower the People's Grants for secondary vocational schools starting from February of this year is reasonable. I have a classmate from the countryside who used to eat three meals of thin porridge a day at home, without any meat for the whole month. In middle school, his food expenses were 7.5 yuan per month, and he could eat meat twice a week, with two meals of dry rice a day. At that time, he said, "I feel like I'm living in paradise; there's no such life at home!" Since entering the secondary vocational school two years ago, the state has provided him with a grant of 12 yuan per month (including 10 yuan for food), with two meals of dry rice a day, and two dishes and a soup for each meal, with meat every day. After a long time, he actually said, "Actually, it's nothing!" And then complained that the "fish doesn't taste good" and the "meat doesn't suit my taste."
    From this vivid fact, we can see that for a young student, if the standard of living is too high (of course, compared to the broad masses of the people), after a long time, he will naturally forget the hard life of the past, develop a spoiled and pampered lifestyle, and gradually become detached from the broad masses of the people. Therefore, the state's appropriate reduction of grants is not only meaningful for accumulating funds, but more importantly for cultivating the spirit of hard work and plain living in young people.

### 降低人民助学金

    降低人民助学金
    国家规定从今年2月份起普遍降低中等专业学校的人民助学金是有道理的。我有一个来自农村的同学，他过去在家里每天吃三顿稀饭，整月不吃荤；在中学时，伙食费每月七元五角，一星期可吃两次荤，一天两顿干饭。那时他说：“我仿佛生活在天堂上了，在家里哪有这样的生活！”前年他进入中等专业学校以后，国家每个月供给他十二元助学金（包括伙食费十元），每天两顿干饭，每顿二菜一汤，天天吃荤。时间久了，他倒反而说：“其实也没有什么！”于是嫌“鱼味不佳”、“肉不合口”。
    从这个活生生的事实可看出：对于一个青年学生，如果生活水平过高（当然是与广大人民群众比较），日子一久，他就会自然而然地忘记过去的艰苦生活，养成一种娇生惯养的生活作风，渐渐地脱离广大人民群众。因此，国家适当降低助学金，其意义不仅在于积累资金，更重要的还在培养青年人的艰苦朴素的精神。
