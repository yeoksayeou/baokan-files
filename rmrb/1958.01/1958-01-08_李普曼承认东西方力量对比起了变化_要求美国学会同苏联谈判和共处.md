Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th: American commentator Walter Lippmann published an article in the latest issue of "Outlook" magazine, demanding that the United States "should learn to live in peace with Russia."

Lippmann acknowledged that the achievements of Soviet science have changed the balance of power between East and West. He wrote: "Soviet achievements undoubtedly mean that our current situation is worse compared to our powerful opponents and enemies. The alarming speed of Soviet achievements (if we cannot catch up with it) predicts that Russia's influence will grow not only in military power, but also politically and economically. ... We have to admit this harsh fact: we are not only behind, but, in the current actual situation, we will remain behind in the future... This problem cannot be solved with a new appropriation, new government decisions, and replacing people in the Pentagon... We must drastically change our way of life so that the slope on which we currently stand does not become a road leading the West all the way down."

Lippmann pointed out that among the many factors that the United States should "re-estimate," "foreign policy plays an important role." "We are in a new situation, which is fundamentally different from the past." Lippmann believes that "a new important factor" is that "air supremacy" is no longer in the hands of the United States.

Lippmann continued, "We are not yet accustomed to living in a world with equally matched opponent countries. The propositions of our foreign policy have always been based on the assumption that there is no other way out for our enemies except to show them the way out after their unconditional surrender. This idea became the basis of the foreign policy propositions of Wilson and Roosevelt. This idea also became the basis of President Eisenhower's propositions, or rather, this idea was the starting point of Dulles' thinking."

Lippmann pointed out that under the current balance of power, "if the Soviet Union and Red China are unwilling to take actions that amount to unconditional surrender, then the policies we insist on in East Asia, the Middle East, and Germany will not work in any case... This is very clear from the situation in East Asia. In the Middle East, the premise on which our overall policy is based is that the entire region belongs to the Western sphere of influence in international relations and that the Soviet Union must be squeezed out and driven out of here. We can supply weapons to any country that is willing to accept these weapons. We can provide economic assistance. But the Russians should not supply weapons and provide economic assistance. If this policy can be achieved, that would not be bad. However, Russia is a very powerful country, and the Near East is very close to Russia, just as Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies are close to the United States. The policy of squeezing out and expelling Russia can only be effective when the Soviet Union is defeated and forced to surrender unconditionally."

He continued: "Our policy toward Germany, if there is any hope of success, is also very tempting. Our condition is that Russia should agree to elections, after which East Germany will undoubtedly be annexed by West Germany. This unified Germany, led by Dr. Adenauer and his political successors, will still be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, so that the military power of the West will be close to the border of Poland. Isn't the condition of our proposal on Germany just like proposing to open a hotel on the moon?"

Lippmann pointed out that the United States must learn to "negotiate with the Soviet Union and regard it as an equal country, not a defeated country that has been shattered."

Lippmann concluded: "Negotiations will be long and very laborious. However, no matter how time-consuming and laborious the negotiations are, the desire to negotiate should always be the fundamental principle of our foreign policy. We should not fail to seek conditions that can eventually be accepted by both sides. I don't see any other way for us. Because the main thing is that we have to live in a world in the future where our opponents and enemies are as powerful as we are, or even more powerful than we are. In this case, only by making our diplomacy as wise and far-sighted as theirs can we protect and defend our interests."

### 李普曼承认东西方力量对比起了变化  要求美国学会同苏联谈判和共处

    李普曼承认东西方力量对比起了变化
    要求美国学会同苏联谈判和共处
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿6日讯：美国著名评论员李普曼在最近一期“展望”杂志上发表一篇文章，要求美国“应当学会同俄国和睦共处”。
    李普曼承认苏联科学的成就已经使东西方的力量对比起了变化。他写道：“苏联的成就无疑是意味着，同我们强大的对手和敌人相比，我们现在的处境要比它坏，苏联成就的惊人速度（如果我们不能赶上它的话）预示着，俄国不仅在军事力量方面，而且在政治方面和经济方面的影响都在增长。……我们不得不承认这个严酷的事实：我们不仅落后，而且，在目前的实际状况下，我们今后仍将落后……这个问题并不是用一笔新的拨款、政府新的决定和五角大楼换上新人就能解决得了的……我们必须要大力改变我们的生活方式，使我们目前立足其上的斜坡不致成为一条导致西方一直滑下去的路。”
    李普曼指出，在美国应当“重新加以估计”的许多因素当中，“外交政策起着重要作用”。“我们处在一种新的情况，这种情况同过去的情况有着根本区别。”李普曼认为，“一个新的重要因素”是“空中统治权”已经不掌握在美国的手里了。
    李普曼接着说，“我们还不习惯同势均力敌的对手国家生活在一个世界上。我们的外交政策的主张过去一向是以这样的假定为基础的：对于我们的敌人除了在他们无条件投降以后我们指给他们出路而外，不可能有另外的出路。这种思想成了威尔逊和罗斯福的外交政策的主张的基础。这种思想也成了艾森豪威尔总统的主张的基础，或者更确切地说，这种思想是杜勒斯思维的出发点。”
    李普曼指出，在目前力量对比下，“如果苏联和红色中国不愿意采取等于是无条件投降的做法，那末，我们在东亚、中东和德国所坚持的政策是无论如何也行不通的……从东亚的情形来看，这一点是很清楚的。在中东我们总的政策所根据的前提是：在国际关系上说，整个这个地区是属于西方势力范围的，必须把苏联从这里排挤掉和赶出去。我们可以供应武器给任何一个愿意接受这些武器的国家。我们可以提供经济援助。但是俄国人不应当供应武器和提供经济援助。这种政策如果能够实现的话，那倒也不坏。然而俄国是个非常强大的国家，而且近东离俄国很近，像墨西哥、中美、西印度群岛同美国相近是一样的，只有在苏联遭到失败并被迫无条件投降时，排挤和驱逐俄国的政策才可能得到效果。”
    他继续说：“我们对德国的政策，如果有成功指望的话，那也是很诱人的。我们的条件是俄国应当同意选举，在这种选举以后东德要毫无疑问地被西德吞并。阿登纳博士和他的政治继承者所领导的这个统一了的德国将仍然是北大西洋公约组织的成员国，这样一来，西方的军事威力就接近了波兰的边境。我们关于德国提出的建议的条件，还不就是像提出一项要在月球开设旅馆的建议一样吗？”
    李普曼指出，美国必须学会“同苏联谈判和把它看作是一个平等的国家，而不是被打得土崩瓦解的战败国家。”
    李普曼最后写道：“谈判将是长期的和十分费力的事。但是，不管谈判是多么的花时间和费气力，要求谈判的愿望应该永远是我们外交政策的根本原则。我们不应该不去寻求那种终究能为双方接受的条件。我看，我们没有什么别的办法。因为主要的是，我们今后得生活在这样一个世界上，在这个世界上我们的对手和敌人像我们一样的强大，甚至还超过我们。在这种情况下，只有使我们的外交也像他们的外交一样的明智和具有远见，我们才能保护和捍卫我们的利益。”
