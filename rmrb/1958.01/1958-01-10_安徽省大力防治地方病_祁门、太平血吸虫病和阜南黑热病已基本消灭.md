Anhui Province Vigorously Prevents and Controls Endemic Diseases
Qimen, Taiping Schistosomiasis and Funan Kala-azar Have Been Basically Eliminated

(Our newspaper's dispatch) According to Anhui Daily: During the First Five-Year Plan period, Anhui Province carried out large-scale prevention and control work on nine kinds of endemic diseases, mainly schistosomiasis, which posed the most serious threat to the people, and achieved great results.

In terms of eliminating schistosomiasis, snail extermination work has been carried out on an area of over 110 million square meters in recent years, fecal management has been implemented in over 650,000 households, and over 140,000 patients have been treated. At present, Qimen and Taiping counties have basically eliminated schistosomiasis.

In kala-azar epidemic areas, drug spraying has been carried out every year to kill sandflies. In 1956 alone, nearly 3 million square meters were sprayed with "666," and the density of sandflies has decreased significantly. Over the past five years, a total of 34,120 kala-azar patients have been treated, and the incidence rate has dropped from 8 per 10,000 in 1953 to 2.8 per 10,000. Funan County, a severely epidemic area, has basically eliminated kala-azar.

Over the past five years, through vigorous prevention and control, mobilizing the masses to kill mosquitoes and salvage mosquito larvae, the incidence rate of malaria has been declining year by year. In Daguan Township, Tongcheng County, the number of people infected in 1955 accounted for 25% of the total population, and most of them suffered from malignant malaria. Through prevention and control, the number of people infected in 1957 has been reduced to 3.85% of the total population.

In addition, focusing on Jinzhai and Yuexi counties, a number of syphilis patients have been treated over the past five years. More than 121,000 patients with goiter have been treated. About 90% of leprosy patients have received inpatient and local treatment. Pilot prevention and control work has also been carried out on filariasis, hookworm disease, and tinea capitis, and certain results have been achieved.

    安徽省大力防治地方病
    祁门、太平血吸虫病和阜南黑热病已基本消灭
    本报讯　据安徽日报消息：在第一个五年计划期间，安徽省各地对危害人民最严重的以血吸虫病为主的九种地方病，展开了大规模的防治工作，并取得了很大的成绩。
    在消灭血吸虫病方面，几年来在一亿一千多万平方公尺的面积上进行了灭螺工作，粪便管理的有六十五万多户，治疗病人十四万多名。目前，祁门、太平两县已基本上消灭了血吸虫病。
    在黑热病流行区，每年都进行了药物灭蛉工作，仅1956年就用“六六六”喷洒了近三百万平方公尺，白蛉密度显著下降，五年来共治疗黑热病人三万四千一百二十人，发病率已由1953年的万分之八降低到万分之二点八，严重流行区阜南县已基本消灭了黑热病。
    五年来通过大力防治，发动群众灭蚊和打捞孑孓，疟疾发病率逐年下降。桐城县大关乡1955年发病人数占人口总数的25％，而且大多是恶性疟疾，通过防治，1957年发病人数已降低为人口总数的3.85％。
    此外，以金寨、岳西两县为重点，五年来治疗了一批梅毒病人。患甲状腺肿病的病人得到治疗的已有十二万一千多人。麻疯病人得到住院和就地治疗的占病人总数的90％左右。对血丝虫病、钩虫病和头部癣病，也都进行了试点防治工作，取得一定的成绩。
