Fields and Riverbeds are Battlefields, Hoes and Shoulder Poles are Swords and Spears
Wenling Strives for a Thousand Jin Per Mu

This newspaper reports: Wenling County, Zhejiang Province, which achieved a grain yield of 816 jin per mu last year, has formulated a production plan for 1958 while selling 60% of its surplus grain to the state: to ensure an average grain yield of 900 jin; and to strive to become a "thousand-jin county."

In order to prepare conditions for achieving this target, the county's farmers have launched a high tide of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. The slogans they put forward are: "Fields and riverbeds are battlefields, hoes and shoulder poles are swords and spears," "March towards high mountains, big rivers, and the distant sea!"

After two months of effort since the beginning of winter, small-scale water conservancy projects have started construction everywhere, and more than one hundred have already been completed. The large-scale Homan Reservoir is also under construction day and night. By mid-December, on average, more than one-third of the county's paddy fields had been fertilized with base fertilizer.

Agricultural cooperatives are also very enthusiastic about cultivating green manure. The second round of ash fertilizer has been universally applied; Zeguo, Xinhe and other agricultural cooperatives have begun applying the third round of ash fertilizer. Now all the green manure crops in the county are growing very well, and green seedlings can be seen everywhere in the fields.

    温岭争取亩产千斤
    本报讯　去年亩产粮食八百一十六斤的浙江温岭县，在把60％的超产粮卖给国家的同时制定了1958年的生产计划：保证粮食平均产量达到九百斤；争取成为千斤县。
    为了给实现这个指标准备好条件，全县农民掀起兴修水利和积肥的高潮，他们提出的口号是：“田地、河底是战场，锄头扁担当刀枪”“向高山、大河、远海进军”。
    经过入冬以来两个月的努力，小型水利工程已普遍开工，并有一百多处已经完成。大型的湖漫水库也在不分昼夜的兴建中。到12月中旬全县平均三分之一以上的稻田已施上基肥。
    各农业社培育绿肥的劲头也很大，第二遍灰肥已普遍施完；泽国、新河等农业社已开始施第三遍灰肥。现在全县的绿肥作物都生长的很好，田野里到处有绿色的草子。
