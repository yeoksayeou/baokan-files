    Forest Fires Can Definitely Be Eliminated
    Forest fires occur every year, and some people have lost confidence in extinguishing them, thinking it is impossible. Is this really the case? The facts tell us: no. From the distant north of our motherland comes exciting news: the Greater Khingan Range forest area had its first year without any fires last year. Just thinking about how a single fierce forest fire can destroy more forest than years of afforestation can achieve, one can understand how important the victory in fire prevention in the Greater Khingan Range forest area is for protecting the country's forest treasures.
    Is this accidental? No. How did the Greater Khingan Range forest area achieve this? Most importantly, by relying on the masses and adopting active measures, rather than passive ones. To eliminate forest fires, we must neither let the masses enter the mountains for production without any control, nor passively prohibit all masses from entering the mountains; the correct way is: to carry out extensive and in-depth education and organization work, mobilize the masses, organize the forces, combine forest protection with the masses' sideline production, and combine the scientific and technological knowledge of fire prevention and firefighting with the masses' daily forest protection work. What plays a decisive role here is the attitude of the broad masses towards the forest. Originally, protecting the forest is closely related to the vital interests of the masses. The forest contains inexhaustible treasures. If the forest is burned down, it is the people in the mountainous areas who will suffer the most. They may have no firewood to burn, and it will be difficult for them to find water to drink; it will be difficult to grow food crops, and it will be difficult to hunt birds and animals. As long as everyone understands this, they will abandon the idea of only caring about immediate gains regardless of the consequences, and treat the forest as their lifeblood, protecting and cultivating it without relaxation at any time.
    The Greater Khingan Range forest area has set a good example. It is hoped that the people in the Greater Khingan Range area will do a better job in forest protection in 1958, and that more fire-free forest areas will appear throughout the country!

### 一定能消灭森林火灾

    一定能消灭森林火灾
    年年发生森林火灾，有些人失去了消灭山火的信心，以为这是做不到的事。真是这样的吗？事实回答我们：不是。从遥远的祖国北方传来了令人欣喜的消息：大兴安岭林区去年第一次全年没有发生火灾。只要想想一次凶猛的山火所毁掉的森林可能远远超过多年造林的成果，就可以了解大兴安岭林区防火的胜利，对于维护祖国的森林宝藏有多么重要的意义。
    这是偶然的吗？不是。大兴安岭林区是怎样做到这一点的？最重要的是依靠群众，采取积极的办法，而不是采取消极的办法。要消灭森林火灾，既不能对群众入山生产放任不管，也不能消极地禁止一切群众入山；正确的途径是：进行广泛深入的教育工作和组织工作，把群众动员起来，把力量组织起来，把护林跟群众的副业生产结合起来，把防火救火的科学技术跟群众的日常护林工作配合起来。这里起决定作用的是广大群众对森林的态度。本来，保护森林跟群众切身利益是密切相关的。森林里蕴藏着取之不尽的财宝。如果森林被烧光了，首先受祸的正是山区人民，他们可能既没有柴烧，也难找到水吃；既难种好五谷杂粮，也难猎到飞禽走兽。只要让每个人都懂得这个道理，他们就会抛弃只顾眼前捞一把而不顾后果的想法，而把森林当做命根子，一时一刻也不放松地保护它、培育它。
    大兴安岭林区已经做出了好榜样，希望1958年大兴安岭地区的人们把护林工作做得更好，希望全国各地出现更多的无火灾的林区！
