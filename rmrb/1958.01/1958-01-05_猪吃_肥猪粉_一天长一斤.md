Pigs Eating "Fat Pig Powder" Gain One Jin Per Day

Changchun Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine and other units use a kind of fat pig powder to feed adult pigs, which can gain more than one jin of meat per day, and the quality of the meat is also very good.

Not long ago, a pork tasting appraisal meeting with fifty people participating was held in the state-owned Changchun Canteen. Experienced chefs used two kinds of pork, one fed with fat pig powder and one not, and used the same cooking methods to make more than a dozen dishes such as braised pork hock and steamed pork with brown sauce for the participants to taste and evaluate. Everyone thought that the dishes made from these two kinds of pork tasted equally delicious; the pork fed with fat pig powder had thicker fat and was more tender and delicious. After the research unit organized slice analysis, it was proved that the pork fed with fat pig powder had about 6% less water content than the pork that had not been fed with fat pig powder, but the content of protein and sugar increased, the fat was thicker, the oil yield was higher, and the congealing point of the fat was the same as that of ordinary pigs. At the same time, three days after the pigs eat this fat pig powder, the medicinal properties of the fat pig powder will disappear, and the pork can be completely used for processing canned food or for export.

For more than a year, Changchun Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine and Changchun Food Company have used different amounts of fat pig powder mixed with feed to feed a total of 329 pigs in four batches. The results show that the fat pig powder prepared with 0.2% methylthiouracil is the fastest and best for fattening pigs, gaining more than 60 jin in 50 days. Pigs not fed with fat pig powder only gained 27 jin during the same period.

This fat pig powder is made by mixing methylthiouracil, rhubarb powder and starch. Each time, one gram is fed to the pig, twice a day. It can inhibit the thyroid function of animals and reduce metabolism, so it can be used to feed adult pigs to achieve the purpose of fattening. However, this fat pig powder cannot be used to feed young pigs under six months of age, otherwise it will reduce the thyroid function of young pigs and stop their development.

Now pharmaceutical factories in Andong and other places are preparing to produce this fat pig powder or fat pig tablets. Fat pig powder is cheap and easy to use. Feeding a pig for 50 days before slaughter only costs more than 20 cents in total. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 猪吃“肥猪粉”　一天长一斤

    猪吃“肥猪粉”　一天长一斤
    长春畜牧兽医大学等单位用一种肥猪粉来喂养成年生猪，每天能增长一斤多肉，肉的质量也很好。
    不久以前，在国营长春食堂举行了一次有五十人参加的猪肉尝味鉴定会，有经验的厨师用喂过和没有喂过肥猪粉的两种猪肉，用同样的烹饪方法做成红闷肘子、扣肉等十几样菜肴，供参加鉴定会的人品评。大家认为，这两种猪肉做成的菜同样好吃；用肥猪粉喂养的猪肉，脂肪更厚，更细嫩可口。经过研究单位组织切片分析，证明用肥猪粉喂养的猪，肉里的含水量比没有喂过肥猪粉的猪少6％左右，但是蛋白质和醣的成分增多，脂肪厚，出油率高，脂肪的凝融点和普通猪的脂肪相同。同时，猪在吃了这种肥猪粉以后三天，肥猪粉药性就会消失，猪肉完全可以用来加工罐头或者出口。
    长春畜牧兽医大学和长春市食品公司，一年多来，用不同分量的肥猪粉掺拌饲料，先后喂养了四批共三百二十九头生猪，结果证明，用千分之二克甲基硫氧嘧啶配制的肥猪粉，喂养的猪长膘最快最好，五十天可长六十多斤。不用肥猪粉喂养的猪，同时期只长二十七斤。
    这种肥猪粉是用甲基硫氧嘧啶、大黄末和淀粉混合制成，每次喂猪一克，一天两次。它能抑制动物甲状腺机能，使新陈代谢降低，所以用来喂养成年生猪能够达到肥育的目的。但是这种肥猪粉不能用来饲养六个月以下的幼龄生猪，否则将使幼龄生猪的甲状腺机能减退，停止发育。
    现在安东等地的制药厂正在准备生产这种肥猪粉或肥猪片。肥猪粉的价格便宜，使用方便，一头猪在宰杀前喂养五十天，总共才花二角多钱。（新华社）
