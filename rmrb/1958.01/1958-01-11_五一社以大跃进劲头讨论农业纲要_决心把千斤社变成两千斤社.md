    The "May First" Cooperative Discusses the Agricultural Program with Great Leap Forward Enthusiasm
    Determined to Turn the "Thousand Jin" Cooperative into a "Two Thousand Jin" Cooperative

    (Our Dispatch) The "May First" Cooperative in Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, discussed the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and resolved to transform the "Thousand Jin" cooperative into a "Two Thousand Jin" cooperative within the Second Five-Year Plan. Last year, the average grain yield of the "May First" Cooperative had already reached 1,100 jin. When they began discussing the agricultural program, the cooperative members, seeing that the program only stipulated 800 jin, said, "It's nothing, we've already exceeded it." Later, they further clarified the spirit of the program and realized that the program was aimed at increasing yields from 400 jin to 800 jin, and that they should also double their yields. Therefore, they further explored their potential by summarizing the First Five-Year Plan. In the summary, it was discovered that although the grain yield in 1957 (both spring and summer harvests) had increased by 70% compared to 1952, there were still significant loopholes. First, according to experiments, each mu should be fertilized with 80 dan (a local unit of measurement commonly used by farmers), specifically 50 dan for the summer harvest and 30 dan for the spring harvest. However, the current amount is still less than 50 dan. Second, approximately one-tenth of the cooperative's land is affected by flooding, with a yield of only around 800 jin per mu. Third, sparrow infestation, field mouse infestation, and pests and diseases cause a loss of 5%-7% of grain each year. Fourth, the farming methods for spring crops still remain in a backward state of "sowing without worry, regardless of the harvest," without fertilization or processing. Through specific calculations, these loopholes can be gradually eliminated before 1962. With the implementation of the plans to eliminate these loopholes each year, this year's production will increase by 9.9% compared to last year, and next year's production will increase by 12.01% compared to this year. By 1962, the total yield per mu of the cooperative will reach 2,095 jin. At the same time, there will be significant growth in cash crops and sideline occupations. By then, the total income of the cooperative will be more than double that of last year (with an income of 331 yuan per person, including household sideline occupations).

    During the discussion of this plan, some cooperative members even considered it a bit conservative. They said that according to the plan, each household would only raise a little more than three pigs by 1962, but by that time, each household should be able to raise at least five. Moreover, the expansion of the multiple cropping area was not even factored in. The current multiple cropping index of the cooperative is 180%, and it is possible to reach 230% by that time.

### 五一社以大跃进劲头讨论农业纲要  决心把千斤社变成两千斤社

    五一社以大跃进劲头讨论农业纲要
    决心把千斤社变成两千斤社
    本报讯　云南宜良县五一社讨论了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），要在第二个五年计划内把千斤社变为二千斤社。五一社去年的粮食产量平均已达到一千一百斤。在开始讨论农业纲要时，社员看到纲要订的只是八百斤，就说：“没什么了，我们早超过了。”后来他们又进一步辩明了纲要的精神，才认识到纲要提的是要从四百斤提高到八百斤，他们也应该再翻一倍才对。于是，他们就通过总结第一个五年计划进一步发掘潜力。在总结中发现1957年粮食大小春虽已比1952年增加了70％，但漏洞仍旧很大。第一，根据试验，每亩应该压肥料八十挑（当地农民习用的计量单位）即大春五十挑、小春三十挑。可是现在还不到五十挑。第二，尚有占全社十分之一的土地受到涝灾，每亩产量只有八百多斤。第三，雀害、田鼠害和病虫害，每年损失粮食5％—7％。第四，小春作物的耕作方法尚停留在“有收无收，下地无忧”的落后状态，没有施肥也没有加工。经过具体的算账，这些漏洞完全可以在1962年以前逐渐杜绝。随着每年杜绝这些漏洞的规划的实现，今年将比去年增产9.9％，明年又比今年增产12.01％。到1962年，全社每亩产量就将达二千零九十五斤。同时，经济作物和副业都有很大的增长。到那时，全社的总收入将比去年增加一倍多（每人收入三百三十一元，连家庭副业在内）。
    这一规划在讨论中，有部分社员还认为保守了一点。他们说，按规划到1962年，每户养猪才合三头多，但到那时每户至少也能养五头。而扩大复种面积这一项根本就没有算进去。现在社里的复种指数是180％，到那时达到230％是可能的。
