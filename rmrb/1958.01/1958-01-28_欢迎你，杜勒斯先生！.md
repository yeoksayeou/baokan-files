    "Welcome, Mr. Dulles!"
    Shortly after Dulles arrived in Ankara, bomb explosions occurred one after another near the local American Embassy and the United States Information Service. This was not a mere coincidence. Turkish Prime Minister Menderes also admitted that this was "a demonstration" by the patriotic people of Turkey.
    It is a coincidence: the United States used the explosion of "Vanguard" to congratulate the Ankara Conference, while the Turkish people used bomb explosions to welcome the US Secretary of State.

### “欢迎你，杜勒斯先生！”

    “欢迎你，杜勒斯先生！”
    在杜勒斯到达安卡拉后不久，当地的美国大使馆和美国新闻处附近接连发生炸弹爆炸事件。这并不是偶然的巧合。土耳其总理曼德列斯也承认这是土耳其爱国人民的“一个示威”。
    这倒是巧合：美国用“先锋号”的爆炸来给安卡拉会议贺喜，土耳其人民则用炸弹的爆炸来向美国国务卿表示欢迎。
