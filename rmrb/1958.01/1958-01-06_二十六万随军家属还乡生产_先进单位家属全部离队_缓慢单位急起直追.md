　　This newspaper reports that in the past half-month, thousands upon thousands of dependents of People's Liberation Army personnel have been leaving the military to join the production front. As of New Year's Eve, the number of dependents returning home throughout the army has reached 261,500, an increase of more than 150,000 compared to the statistics from early December. Units with rapid progress, such as the Railway Engineering Corps, have seen 70.86% of their dependents return home; the Beijing Military Region has seen 65.29% of the dependents who should return home do so; and the dependents of military personnel in Qingfeng and Runan counties in Henan, and Changle and Shouguang counties in Shandong have all returned home. The Fujian Military Region saw an average of more than 200 dependents join the production front each day in the week of December 16th to 23rd. The Shenyang Military Region saw the number of dependents returning home increase from 7,000 in early December to more than 20,000 in the latter part of the month. The General Logistics Department expects that approximately 70% of dependents will return home before the Spring Festival.

　　Currently, some units with slower progress are rapidly catching up. Some units of a certain military force initially felt that with the Spring Festival approaching, the weather getting colder, and the current agricultural slack season, there might be ideological resistance from officers and their dependents, and that practical difficulties might not be resolved, thus they lacked confidence in mobilizing dependents to return home before the Spring Festival. After discussion, the leadership overcame right-leaning sentiments, emphasized conducting thorough ideological mobilization work and meticulous organizational work, and quickly reversed the situation, moving from a registration high tide to an action high tide. The directly subordinate organs of this unit saw the number of dependents returning home exceed 40% within a week, and the communications battalion reached 60%; the unit with the slowest progress initially has now reached 79.1%, becoming the best unit in the force. In addition, many units have used methods such as discussion meetings, family meetings, individual talks, and door-to-door visits to conduct propaganda and education for officers and their dependents, dispelling their ideological concerns; at the same time, they are conducting screening and assessment, and actively providing care for dependents with special difficulties and pregnant women nearing their due date, truly achieving satisfaction for dependents, officers, and leaders. When dependents leave the team, the leading organs of many troops also send people to the station and pier. The Fuzhou area military sub-districts and the prefectural committee jointly formed several liaison stations for returning dependents, distributed on the main transportation routes, specifically responsible for helping returning dependents solve food, lodging and other specific problems along the way, reducing the difficulties of dependents during their journey.

　　The work of mobilizing dependents to return home for production has also received great support from local governments and agricultural cooperatives. The Fujian Province and Guangzhou City People's Committee's cotton cloth unified sales offices have specifically solved the problem of cotton cloth and cotton batting for returning dependents whose homes are in cold regions. The Beijing Municipal People's Committee has established a special office responsible for handling the resettlement of returning dependents. Many areas' township and community cadres and the masses warmly welcome the returning dependents. Many dependents who have returned to their hometowns have also written letters saying that they have settled down and joined production with the help of their fellow villagers.

    二十六万随军家属还乡生产
    先进单位家属全部离队　缓慢单位急起直追
    本报讯　近半月来，每天都有成千上万的解放军随军家属离开部队，走上生产战线。截至新年前夕，全军还乡的家属已达二十六万一千五百多人，比12月上旬的统计增加了十五万多人。进展快的单位，如铁道兵部队还乡家属已达随军家属总人数的70.86％；北京部队还乡的家属，已占应还乡人数的65.29％；河南清丰、汝南，山东昌乐、寿光等县兵役局的随军家属已全部还乡。福建省军区在12月16日至23日的一周内，平均每日有两百多名家属走上生产战线。沈阳部队12月上旬还乡的家属共七千名，到同月下旬就增加到两万多人。总后勤部预计在春节前可有70％左右的家属还乡。
    目前，一些进展比较慢的单位，正在急起直追。某部队有些单位起初觉得春节将近，天气冷了，现在又是农闲季节，怕军官和家属有思想阻力，怕实际困难解决不了，因此对动员家属春节前还乡信心不足。经过讨论，领导上克服了右倾情绪，强调做好深入的思想动员工作和细致的组织工作，很快就扭转了形势，由报名高潮走上了行动高潮。该部直属机关一周内还乡的家属即突破40％，通信营已达60％；原来进展最慢的一个部队，现在也已达到79.1％，成为该部最好的一个单位。此外，许多部队都运用座谈会、家庭会、个别谈心、挨门挨户拜访等方式，对军官和家属进行宣传教育，解除他们的思想顾虑；同时进行排队摸底，对某些有特殊困难的家属和临近产期的孕妇，主动地给予照顾，真正做到了家属、军官、领导三满意。许多部队的家属离队时，领导机关还派人送到车站、码头。福州地区各军分区和地委联合组成了若干个家属还乡联络站，分布在交通要道上，专门负责帮助还乡家属解决途中吃住及其它具体问题，减少家属旅途中的困难。
    动员家属还乡生产的工作，还得到了各地政府和农业社很大的支持。福建省和广州市人民委员会的棉布统销办公室，专门为家在寒区的还乡家属解决了棉布和棉絮的问题。北京市人民委员会成立了专门的办公室，负责处理返乡家属的安置工作。不少地区的乡、社干部和群众热烈欢迎了回乡的家属。还有许多回到家乡的家属来信说，她们在乡亲们的帮助下，已经安好家，参加了生产。
