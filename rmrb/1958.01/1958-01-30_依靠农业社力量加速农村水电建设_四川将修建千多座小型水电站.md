Relying on the Strength of Agricultural Cooperatives to Accelerate Rural Hydropower Construction
Sichuan to Build Over a Thousand Small Hydropower Stations

This newspaper Chengdu, January 29th (dispatch). This year Sichuan will vigorously rely on the strength of the masses to build over a thousand small hydropower stations with a generating capacity of over 13,000 kilowatts. This is the rural hydropower construction plan formulated at the Provincial Rural Hydropower and Mechanical Water Lifting Work Conference which concluded on January 27th.

Since 1956, Sichuan has relied on agricultural cooperatives to build eighty hydropower stations with a generating capacity of nearly 1,000 kilowatts and thirty-one hydraulic stations in fifty counties within twelve special districts and autonomous prefectures, providing cheap electrical power for rural water conservancy and irrigation, agricultural and sideline product processing, and lighting. As a result, agricultural cooperatives are actively requesting the construction of hydropower stations. The agricultural cooperatives in Wenjiang Special District alone have raised funds to build forty-six hydropower stations.

Sichuan has a dense network of rivers and extremely abundant hydropower resources. According to preliminary estimates, the hydro resources available for rural construction of small hydropower stations amount to 500,000 kilowatts. In order to accelerate rural hydropower construction, the conference decided that all areas in the province that can utilize hydropower generation should combine it with water conservancy and irrigation as much as possible within ten years, basically achieving one small hydropower station for one or several townships, with a total generating capacity striving to reach around 100,000 kilowatts. This year, wherever conditions permit, more than a thousand small hydropower stations will be built according to the principles of “cooperatively run and cooperatively managed” and “small investment, large returns, and quick returns.”

### 依靠农业社力量加速农村水电建设  四川将修建千多座小型水电站

    依靠农业社力量加速农村水电建设
    四川将修建千多座小型水电站
    本报成都29日电　今年四川将大力依靠群众力量，修建一千多座小型水电站，发电容量达一万三千多瓩。这是1月27日结束的全省农村水电、机械提水工作会议制定的农村水电建设计划。
    1956年以来，四川各地依靠农业社，已在十二个专区和自治州所属的五十个县内修了发电容量近千瓩的八十座水电站和三十一处水力站，为农村水利灌溉、农副业加工和照明提供了廉价的电动力。因此，农业社积极要求修建水电站，仅温江专区的农业社就自筹资金修建四十六座水电站。
    四川河流密布，水电资源极为丰富，据初测可供农村建立小型水电站的水力资源达五十万瓩。为了加速农村水电建设，会议决定，全省凡是能利用水力发电的地方，在十年内尽可能与水利灌溉相结合，基本上做到一个乡或者几个乡建立一个小型水力发电站，总发电量争取达到十万瓩左右。今年凡有条件的地区，根据“社办社管”方针，和“投资小、收效大、收效快”原则，修建一千多座小型水电站。
