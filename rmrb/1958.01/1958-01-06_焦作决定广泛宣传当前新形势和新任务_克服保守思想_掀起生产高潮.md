Jiaozuo Decides to Widely Publicize the Current New Situation and New Tasks
Overcome Conservative Ideas and Launch a Production Upsurge

(Our Dispatch) The recent Second Meeting of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Jiaozuo City Committee, using the democratic forms of extensive airing of views, big debates, large-character posters, emphatically criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking among cadres at all levels. After ideological criticism, all the representatives were full of confidence and determined to organize and lead a new upsurge in industrial production to support the great leap forward in agriculture.

The meeting held that: to organize and lead the new upsurge of production and construction, it is necessary to thoroughly criticize and overcome right-leaning conservative thinking. For five years, the city committee's leadership of industrial production and construction has been basically correct, thus ensuring that all factories and mines completed the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. However, some comrades are content with the status quo in leading capital construction, and have a tendency to follow the old ways in technological reforms. Some responsible persons of enterprises are not clear about the new situation and new tasks of current industrial production, are not enthusiastic, and lack energy, and have not enthusiastically and proactively organized and led the new upsurge in production that has already emerged. Some people have exaggerated some of the shortcomings in the 1956 production upsurge and doubt the necessity and possibility of organizing the current new upsurge in production. Some people even say that "agriculture can leap forward, but industry cannot." The meeting organized all the representatives to specifically analyze the current new situation and new tasks, and seriously criticized the above ideas. The meeting demanded that after the meeting, it is necessary to vigorously publicize the current new situation and new tasks to the vast number of cadres and workers, lead them to criticize various negative and conservative ideas, and conduct a serious summary of last year's work, distinguishing between "rash advance" and "leap forward." Leaders should boldly and freely mobilize the masses, promote the spirit of initiative, actively carry out production reforms, formulate a good production plan for 1958, and effectively lead the production upsurge.

The meeting also specifically studied the issue of how to organize a new upsurge in production, and criticized some leading cadres who, upon hearing about organizing a new upsurge, reach out to the state for money, and do not pay attention to following the mass line.

The meeting put forward a series of measures to ensure that Jiaozuo City will increase coal production from 2.4 million tons in 1957 to 6 million tons in the next five years, and increase sulfur production by fifteen times on the current level; and to manufacture a large number of farmland water conservancy machines and chemical fertilizers to support agricultural production.

During the meeting, each delegation put forward advanced goals through tapping potential. For example, the Xiaoma Village Mine delegation proposed at the conference: to ensure that the 1958 coal production will increase by 75% compared with the 1957 state plan. The representatives also put forward many basic measures for organizing a new upsurge in production.

    焦作决定广泛宣传当前新形势和新任务
    克服保守思想　掀起生产高潮
    本报讯　最近举行的中共焦作市第一届代表大会第二次会议，运用大鸣大放大辩大争大字报的民主形式，着重批判了各级干部中的右倾保守思想。经过思想批判，全体代表都满怀信心，要组织和领导好工业生产新高潮，支援农业大跃进。
    会议认为：要组织和领导好生产建设新高潮，必须彻底批判和克服右倾保守思想。五年来，市委对工业生产建设的领导基本上是正确的，因而保证各个厂矿都提前完成了第一个五年计划。但是有的同志在领导基本建设方面满足于现状，在技术改革方面有因循守旧的情绪。有些企业的负责人员对当前工业生产的新形势和新任务认识不清，干劲不大，劲头不足，对于已经出现的生产新高潮没有热情主动地去组织领导。还有人夸大了1956年生产高潮中的某些缺点，怀疑当前组织生产新高潮的必要性和可能性。有的人还说什么“农业能跃进，工业不能跃进”。会议组织全体代表具体分析了当前的新形势和新任务，对上述思想进行了严肃的批判。会议要求会后要大张旗鼓地向广大干部和职工群众宣传当前的新形势和新任务，领导他们批判各种消极保守思想，并且对去年的工作进行认真的总结，分清“冒进”和“跃进”的区别。领导人员要大胆放手地发动群众，提倡首创精神，积极进行生产改革，订好1958年生产计划，切实领导好生产高潮。
    会议还具体研究了如何组织生产新高潮的问题，批判了某些领导干部一听说组织新高潮，就伸手向国家要钱，以及不注意走群众路线等思想倾向。
    会议提出了一系列措施，保证焦作市在今后五年内，把煤炭产量由1957年的二百四十万吨提高到六百万吨，硫磺产量在现有水平上提高十五倍；并且要制造大量农田水利机器和化学肥料，支援农业生产。
    会议期间，各代表团就挖掘潜力，提出了先进的奋斗目标。如小马村矿代表团在大会上提出：保证1958年的煤炭产量比1957年国家计划提高75％。代表们还提出了许多组织生产新高潮的基本措施。
