Implementing "Fourteen Reforms on Water Conservancy Construction Sites" Yields Immediate Results
Yishan Prefectural Committee Promotes Mass Wisdom, Achieving More and Better Water Conservancy Construction

(Reported by our newspaper) After summarizing the good methods created by the masses in large-scale water conservancy construction, the Yishan Prefectural Committee of Guangxi widely promoted the "Fourteen Reforms on Water Conservancy Construction Sites." As a result, the labor efficiency and project quality in various places have been greatly improved.

The mass experiences summarized by the Yishan Prefectural Committee include the following fourteen items:

1.  Change from staying at home to staying at the water conservancy construction site, and set up temporary childcare groups at the construction site.

2.  Change from individual cooking to mutual-aid shift cooking, and from eating in sheds to eating at the construction site.

3.  Change from indiscriminate defecation to building temporary toilets at the construction site, which is convenient, hygienic, and accumulates fertilizer.

4.  Promote the method of three, three, four plus night shifts, that is, within every ten days, three days of big debates, three days of rest and cultural entertainment, and four nights of overtime.

5.  Narrow construction sites and rush work should be carried out continuously day and night in shifts.

6.  Change small baskets (tools for carrying soil) to large baskets, and change fixed-ear baskets to movable-ear baskets, with two baskets per person or three baskets per two people, to avoid the phenomenon of people waiting for baskets.

7.  Change manual hoeing to plowing with oxen (those with double-blade plows use double-blade plows. The process of plowing with oxen can be treated as a separate piecework unit, with piecework contracting).

8.  Change manual carrying of soil to transporting soil with ox carts and horse carts, pushing soil with handcarts, and transporting soil with wooden rail cars.

9.  Change manual carrying of soil to transporting soil with pulleys and chutes (referring to places with slopes); change manual hoeing and manual carrying of soil to oxen blocking soil (i.e., soil bulldozers).

10. Change manual carrying of soil to transporting soil with derricks (i.e., soil cranes, best used when digging deep trenches).

11. Change soil taking and acceptance to acceptance at the dam head, issuing cards by load, and calculating points by card (used for dam filling, not for digging ditches).

12. Change small stone rollers to large stone rollers, and change flat stone rollers to convex stone rollers. Advocate rolling first and then tamping, to better ensure quality (generally small stone rollers are only used for rolling flat; to compact, it is necessary to roll flat and then tamp).

13. Promote pouring lime water when drilling blast holes, that is, pouring lime water while drilling blast holes (use the clear water after the lime is soaked and settled).

14. Fix the locations for taking and accepting soil, and open two routes for round trips, to avoid disordered work and affecting the speed of soil transportation.

From the previous period, the construction sites implementing these reforms have shown significant results. For example, at the Fuyao Reservoir in Laibin County, changing from manual digging to plowing with oxen, one plow can replace four pickaxes, and the workload of four hundred laborers is equivalent to the workload of one thousand seven hundred laborers, with better quality. Using ox carts and handcarts instead of manual carrying of soil, both methods used simultaneously can increase labor efficiency by eight to ten times. The entire project originally required 700,000 workdays, now it only requires 650,000 workdays. The dam head project of the Kenyan Reservoir in Hechi requires 60,000 workdays. After changing manual carrying of soil to transporting soil with wooden rail cars (flat ground) and wire ropeway (high ground), 20,000 workdays can be saved. The Dongjiang District of Rong'an adopted bamboo rail soil trains and double rail soil trains, one up and one down to transport soil, increasing efficiency nearly tenfold. The Jiaping Township of Longtou District in Yishan created wooden pedal tampers, which are convenient, flexible, and mobile, with a pressure of 100 kilograms, three times more efficient than stone tampers. Generally, a stone tamper requires eight people to operate, while a pedal tamper only requires two people (shaped like a foot-operated rice pounding tool, using foot power instead of hand power). In Luolou Reservoir of Huanjiang County, changing from manual pulling of stone rollers to pulling by oxen, one ox can replace ten people. In many large reservoir construction sites in Laibin, the locations for taking and accepting soil are fixed, and two routes for round trips are opened, the work order is orderly, and the speed of soil transportation is improved. Many water conservancy construction sites in Rong'an County separately set up driving roads and sidewalks, improved construction site traffic, and eliminated the phenomenon of personnel congestion and low efficiency. In addition, Laibin, Yishan, Luocheng, Shilong and other places have generally mobilized migrant workers to move to the construction site, and promoted the three, three, four plus night shift method, the daily working hours have generally increased from seven hours to more than ten hours, and labor productivity has greatly increased. The widespread promotion of these reforms in all water conservancy construction sites in the region will play a decisive role in ensuring quality and striving to complete this year's water conservancy tasks before the Spring Festival.

    实行“水利工地十四项改革”立竿见影
    宜山地委发扬群众智慧　水利建设搞得又多又好
    本报讯　广西宜山地委在大兴水利中总结群众创造的好办法，普遍推广了“水利工地十四项改革”后，各地劳动效率和工程质量都得到很大的提高。
    宜山地委总结的群众经验共有以下十四项：
    一、在家住宿改为搬到水利工地住宿，工地设立临时托儿组。
    二、个体煮饭改为互助轮班煮饭，棚厂吃饭改为工地吃饭。
    三、随地大小便改为修建工地临时厕所，既方便卫生又积肥。
    四、推广三、三、四加夜班的办法，即每十天内三天大辩论，三天休息和文化娱乐，四个夜晚加班。
    五、窄工地和突击性工作轮班日夜连续施工。
    六、改小撮箕（装土的用具）为大撮箕，改死耳撮箕为活耳撮箕，每人两个撮箕或两人三个撮箕，以免造成人等撮箕现象。
    七、改人锄土为牛犁土（有双铧犁的以双铧犁犁土。牛犁土的工序可单独做计件单位，进行按件包工）。
    八、改人挑土为牛马车运土和人力车推土、木轨车运土。
    九、改人挑土为滑车、滑梯运土（指有坡度的地方）；改人锄土、人挑土为牛挡土（即土推土机）。
    十、改人挑土为吊杆运土（即土起重机，在挖深沟时采用最好）。
    十一、改取土收方为坝首收方，按担发牌，按牌计分（填坝时用，挖沟渠时不用）。
    十二、改小飞硪为大石滚，改平面石滚为凸形石滚。提倡先滚再打硪，更好的保证质量（一般小石滚只作滚平用，要夯实时，必须滚平后再打硪）。
    十三、推广灌石灰水打炮眼，即边灌石灰水，边打炮眼（石灰浸水沉淀后用其清水）。
    十四、固定取土收土的地点，开好往返两条路线，以免工作没有秩序，影响运土速度。
    从前一段各地实行这些改革的工地来看，效果是显著的。如来宾县富尧水库改人挖土为牛犁土，一架犁可顶四把钉锄，四百个民工的工作量可相当于一千七百个民工的工作量，且质量又好。以牛车、手推车代人挑土，两种办法同时使上，劳动效率可提高八至十倍。全部工程原需七十万工，现只要六十五万工。河池肯研水库坝首工程需要六万工，改人挑土为木轨车运土（平地）和铁线滑车运土（高地）后，可节省两万工。融安东江区采用了竹轨土火车和双轨土火车一上一下运土，提高效率近十倍。宜山龙头区加平乡创造木制脚踏飞硪，方便灵活可以走动，压力达一百公斤，比石硪效率大三倍，一般一个石硪要八人掌握，脚踏飞硪二人即可
  （状如脚踏的舂米器具，用脚踏代手力）。环江县罗楼水库改人拉石滚为牛拉，一头牛可顶十个人。来宾很多大水库工地固定取土收土地点，开好往返两条路线，工作秩序井然，提高了运土速度。融安县不少水利工地分别开车路和人行道，改善了工地交通，消除了人员拥挤、效率不高的现象。此外，来宾、宜山、罗城、石龙等地普遍发动民工搬到工地住，并推广三、三、四加夜班的办法，每天劳动时间普遍由七小时提高到十小时以上，劳动生产率大大提高。这些改革在全区所有水利工地普遍推广后，对保证质量和力争在春节前完成今年修水利任务，将起决定性的作用。
