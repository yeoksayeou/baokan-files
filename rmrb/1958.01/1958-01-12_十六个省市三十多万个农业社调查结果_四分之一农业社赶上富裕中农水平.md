Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: According to recent survey statistics from sixteen provinces and cities on more than 345,000 agricultural cooperatives, 86,616 agricultural cooperatives have reached or exceeded the production and income levels of rich middle peasants, accounting for 25.1% of the surveyed agricultural cooperatives.

    Advanced special zones and counties where large areas have reached or exceeded the level of rich middle peasants have also emerged in these provinces and cities. Tangshan Special Zone in Hebei Province, Changzhi Special Zone in Shanxi Province, Wuhu Special Zone in Anhui Province, as well as Chao'an County in Guangdong Province, Fengxian County and Kunshan County in Jiangsu Province, Hong'an County, Macheng County, Xiaogan County, and Jiangling County in Hubei Province, Pi County in Sichuan Province, Dunhuang County in Gansu Province, and other regions, have 40% to 90% of their agricultural cooperatives reaching or exceeding the production and income levels of local rich middle peasants.

    A crucial indicator of these agricultural cooperatives reaching or surpassing the level of local rich middle peasants is that their per-unit-area yields of grain and cotton generally exceed those of rich middle peasants. For example, the average grain yield per mu in Shantou Special Zone, Guangdong Province, reached 811.6 jin, and the per-mu yield in Chao'an County in this special zone reached 1,233 jin; the per-mu grain yield of most agricultural cooperatives in ten counties, including Hong'an, Xiaogan, and Macheng in Hubei Province, reached 800 jin. These areas have achieved the highest yield targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule. For example, the per-mu yield of ginned cotton in Macheng County, Hubei Province, reached 103 jin, and the per-mu yield of ginned cotton in Dunhuang, Gansu, Cixi, Zhejiang, Guangji, Hubei, and the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City, Hebei, all exceeded 100 jin, greatly exceeding the production level of local rich middle peasants.

    With the development of production, the income of peasants has increased significantly, and their living standards have gradually improved. According to statistics from many agricultural cooperatives, in addition to increased public accumulation funds and production expenditures, the income of cooperative members is higher than that of rich middle peasants. According to a survey in Jiangling County: before the cooperativization in 1955, the average net income per rich middle peasant was 72 yuan. In 1957, the average income per member of agricultural cooperatives in the county was 196.7 yuan, with a net income of 148.4 yuan. The proportion of income increase was the largest for poor peasants. The average income per poor peasant in 1955 was 56.07 yuan, and the income in 1957 was 93.48 yuan, an increase of 66.7%. The average income per middle peasant in 1955 was 71.44 yuan, and the income in 1957 was 99.47 yuan, an increase of 39.23%. In terms of the life of each cooperative member's household, 48% of the peasants in the county reached the level of rich middle peasants in 1956, and 75% of the peasants reached the level of rich middle peasants in 1957. In the Shuizhen area of Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, the average income per cooperative member household in 36 agricultural cooperatives was 130 yuan, and every household exceeded the living standard of rich middle peasants. Last year, the average total income from agriculture and sideline occupations of each member household in the Taiyangsheng Cooperative in Gaiping County reached 776.3 yuan, and the average income per person was 144.26 yuan, an increase of 45 yuan compared with the average income of the 20 cooperative members with rich middle peasant backgrounds when they were working independently. Due to increased income, the cultural and welfare undertakings of agricultural cooperatives have also developed accordingly.

    The ability of a large number of agricultural cooperatives to catch up with or surpass the level of rich middle peasants fully demonstrates the superiority of agricultural cooperativization. The reason why rich middle peasants had high yields in the past was mainly because they originally occupied good land, had strong livestock, had many pigs and manure, had high multiple cropping rates, and cultivated more meticulously; however, the role they can play in production cannot be compared with the socialist collective economy of agricultural cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives have unified land use, concentrated strength, abundant manpower and material resources, and can densely plant according to local conditions, promote new technologies and new farming systems, and expand basic construction. For example, the production movement centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation launched since last autumn is something that rich middle peasants could not have imagined at all. Agricultural cooperatives actively utilize these superior conditions, and at the same time correctly implement the principles of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically, so that they can organize a great leap in production and catch up with or surpass the production and income levels of rich middle peasants.

    Another important reason why agricultural cooperatives can catch up with or exceed the level of rich middle peasants is that they rely on their own public accumulation to expand reproduction and conduct agricultural and sideline production on a large scale, which rich middle peasants cannot do. For example, the public accumulation funds left by agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province last year generally accounted for 8%-10% of net income in general areas, and more than 10% in cash crop areas. Some agricultural cooperatives in Tongxian Special Zone, Hebei Province, have left public accumulation funds that already account for 15% of net income. Many old agricultural cooperatives in Henan, Liaoning, Heilongjiang and other provinces have an average of about 100,000 yuan in public property per cooperative. The Jiajiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Yongchang County, Gansu Province, already owns 366,600 yuan in public property, averaging 340 yuan per household, equivalent to the annual income of an average middle peasant. With a large amount of public accumulation funds, agricultural cooperatives have the strength to expand reproduction. At the same time, many agricultural cooperatives have also stored grain for famine relief.

    A large number of agricultural cooperatives that have caught up with or exceeded the level of rich middle peasants are located in plains, some in mountainous areas, some in low-lying areas, and some in urban suburbs. Among these cooperatives, in addition to a group of old cooperatives, most were developed in 1955. In recent years, these cooperatives have adopted a series of measures to increase production based on local characteristics, and have rapidly improved their production management level. Some cooperatives have also stubbornly overcome water and drought disasters and increased grain yields. Agricultural cooperatives in the plains mainly concentrated manpower, material resources, and financial resources to carry out large-scale farmland water conservancy basic construction, increased irrigation area, expanded paddy fields, and also applied a large amount of fertilizer. Agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas mainly developed forestry, animal husbandry, and other various sideline occupations while ensuring increased grain production, and comprehensively developed the mountainous economy. Agricultural cooperatives in low-lying areas mainly brought into play the spirit of man's determination to conquer nature, transformed the low-lying areas, planted high-yield crops and changed to planting two crops a year. Agricultural cooperatives in urban suburbs mainly took advantage of the favorable conditions of being close to the city, cultivated a large number of vegetables, raised livestock and poultry, and served the city.

    十六个省市三十多万个农业社调查结果
    四分之一农业社赶上富裕中农水平
    据新华社11日讯　根据全国十六个省、市最近对三十四万五千多个农业社的调查统计，已经有八万六千六百十六个农业社赶上或超过富裕中农生产水平和收入水平，占调查的农业社总数的25.1％。
    这些省市还出现了一些大面积赶上或超过富裕中农水平的先进专区和县。河北省唐山专区，山西省长治专区，安徽省芜湖专区以及广东省潮安县，江苏省奉贤县、昆山县，湖北省红安县、麻城县、孝感县、江陵县，四川省郫县，甘肃省敦煌县等地区，都有40％到90％的农业社赶上或超过当地富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平。
    这些农业社赶上或超过当地富裕中农水平一个极重要的标志，是粮食和棉花的单位面积产量一般都超过了富裕中农。如广东省汕头专区平均每亩粮食产量达到八百十一点六斤，这个专区的潮安县每亩产量达到一千二百三十三斤；湖北省的红安、孝感、麻城等十个县的绝大部分农业社的每亩粮食产量都达到八百斤。这些地区都提前实现农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的最高产量指标。如湖北省麻城县皮棉的每亩产量达到一百零三斤，甘肃敦煌、浙江慈溪、湖北广济、河北石家庄市郊区的每亩皮棉产量都在百斤以上，大大超过了当地富裕中农的生产水平。
    随着生产的发展，农民的收入增加很多，生活逐步改善。据许多农业社的统计，除了增加的公积金和生产开支外，社员收入都比富裕中农多。据江陵县调查：在1955年合作化以前，富裕中农纯收入平均每人为七十二元。1957年全县各农业社每个社员平均收入一百九十六点七元，纯收入为一百四十八点四元。社员增加收入的比例以贫农为最大，1955年贫农每人平均收入是五十六点零七元，1957年收入九十三点四八元，增加66.7％。1955年中农每人平均收入七十一点四四元，1957年收入九十九点四七元，增加39.23％。从每户社员生活来说，1956年全县有48％的农民达到了富裕中农水平，1957年有75％的农民达到了富裕中农的水平。辽宁省营口县水源区三十六个农业社，每户社员平均收入一百三十元，家家户户都超过富裕中农生活水平。盖平县太阳升社去年每户社员平均农、副业总收入达到七百七十六元三角，每人平均收入一百四十四元二角六分，同二十户富裕中农成分的社员在单干时的平均收入相比，增加了四十五元。由于增加了收入，农业社的文化福利事业也有了相应的发展。
    大批的农业社所以能赶上或超过富裕中农水平，充分证明了农业合作化的优越性。富裕中农过去的产量之所以高，主要是因为他们原来占有的土地好，畜力壮，猪多粪多，复种率高，耕作较细；但是他们在生产上所能发挥出来的作用，是不可能同社会主义集体经济的农业社相比拟的。农业社土地统一使用，力量集中，人力物力充沛，可以因地密植，推广新技术、新耕作制度和扩大基本建设等。例如去年秋季以来掀起的以兴修水利和积肥为中心的生产运动，是富裕中农根本不敢想像的。农业社积极地利用这些优越条件，同时正确地执行了勤俭办社、民主办社的方针，就能组织生产的大跃进，赶上或超过富裕中农的生产和收入水平。
    农业社能赶上或超过富裕中农水平的另一个重要原因是，依靠本身的公共积累，扩大再生产，大规模地举办富裕中农无法举办的农、副业生产。例如，广东省农业社去年留的公积金，一般地区占纯收入8％—10％，经济作物区超过10％以上。河北省通县专区有些农业社留的公积金已占纯收入15％。河南、辽宁、黑龙江等省不少老的农业社，平均每社都有十万元左右的公共财产。甘肃省永昌县焦家庄农业社已拥有公共财产三十六万六千六百元，平均每户达三百四十元，相当于一般中农全年的收入。农业社有了大量的公积金，就有力量扩大再生产。同时，许多农业社还储存了备荒粮。
    赶上或超过富裕中农水平的大批农业社，有的在平原地区，有的在山区，有的在低洼地区，有的在城市郊区。这些社中除一批老社以外，大部分是1955年发展起来的。几年来，这些社根据本地特点采取了一系列的增产措施，迅速提高了生产管理水平，有些社还顽强地战胜了水旱灾害，提高了粮食产量。平原地区的农业社，主要是集中人力、物力、财力进行了大规模的农田水利基本建设，增加了灌溉面积，扩大了水田，同时又大量增施肥料。山区的农业社，主要是在保证粮食增产的同时，发展了林业、畜牧业和其他各种副业，开展多种经营，全面发展了山区经济。低洼地区的农业社，主要发挥了人定胜天的精神，改造了洼地，种植了高产作物和改种两季作物。在城市郊区的农业社，主要是利用靠近城市的有利条件，大量种植蔬菜，饲养家畜家禽，为城市服务。
