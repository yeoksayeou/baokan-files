Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 16th -- According to "Al-Nour," the Central Committee of the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party held a meeting in Damascus from January 11th to 13th and passed five resolutions.
	The five resolutions are on: 1. The Egyptian-Syrian Federation; 2. Strengthening the Syrian National Front; 3. The Situation in Lebanon; 4. Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries; 5. Peace Declaration of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries.
	"Al-Nour" published the full text of the first two resolutions.
	In its resolution on the Egyptian-Syrian Federation, the Central Committee of the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party stated: "The realization of the Egyptian-Syrian Federation has become possible after Egypt and Syria got rid of imperialist rule and influence and adopted a policy of national independence and liberation." Explaining the benefits that this federation will bring to the people of the two countries, the resolution stated that the federation will lead to strengthening their position, unifying their struggle against imperialism, establishing their liberation policy on a sound basis, and helping to liberate other parts of the Arab world, build their already liberated countries, and increase their role in international affairs for the benefit of the Arab cause and the cause of world peace.
	The resolution stated that the realization of the federation should lead to maintaining friendly relations with the countries of the socialist camp, because the Arab cause will benefit greatly from this friendship.
	The resolution pointed out that imperialism, especially American imperialism, is now the main threat to Arab nationalism. The resolution said: "American imperialism is making its best efforts to force the two countries (Egypt and Syria) to change their policy of liberation and independence, and is trying to pull them into its ranks, destroying their independence and future."
	Regarding the method of establishing the federation, the resolution stated that "the Syrian and Egyptian governments should immediately establish a joint committee to study the various forms of the federation from all aspects and angles," "taking into account the objective conditions of each country, and strive to coordinate and harmonize them, so as to eliminate any loopholes that can be used by the enemies of the federation to carry out sabotage activities."
	The resolution concluded by pointing out that strengthening the Syrian National Front is a fundamental factor in realizing the federation.
	In its resolution on strengthening the Syrian National Front, the Central Committee of the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party emphasized the importance of unity among Syrian nationalist forces. The resolution stated: "Everything that Syria has experienced proves that Syria cannot stand firm in the face of imperialist conspiracies and its treaties if it is not united, if the whole country does not form a line on the national front."
	The resolution pointed out that the American imperialists have not changed their aggressive policy. The United States is still forcing others to accept the Eisenhower Doctrine and the Baghdad Pact, and also wants to establish missile bases in the Baghdad Pact countries. The resolution said that in order to realize its conspiracy, the American imperialists are opening fire on the Syrian National Front in order to create division and tension among the parties of the National Front. The American imperialists are trying to create unfounded differences and expand those ordinary and simple differences that are not enough to affect the major goals of the National Front. At the same time, they began to rush to let their agents adopt the slogan of Arab liberation, acting as if they were supporters of this policy, in order to find opportunities to destroy the National Front.
	The resolution said that the primary task of the National Front is to defeat the American imperialist conspiracy against Syria.
	The resolution said that it is very clear that the crisis situation currently suffered by Syria and the imperialist threat to Syria force patriotic people of all parties and organizations in the country, especially the communists, to regard supporting and strengthening the work of the National Front as the most serious national responsibility on their shoulders.

    叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党中央通过决议
    成立埃叙联邦符合阿拉伯民族利益
    号召加强叙利亚民族阵线击败美国侵略阴谋
    据新华社大马士革16日电　据“光明报”报道，叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会在1月11日到13日在大马士革举行了会议，并且通过了五项决议。
    这五项决议是关于：一、埃及—叙利亚联邦；二、加强叙利亚民族阵线；三、黎巴嫩局势；四、社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言；五、各国共产党和工人党的和平宣言。
    “光明报”刊载了头两个决议的全文。
    叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会在关于埃及—叙利亚联邦的决议中说：“在埃及和叙利亚两国摆脱了帝国主义统治和影响并且采取了民族独立解放的政策以后，埃及—叙利亚联邦的实现已经成为可能。”决议在说明这个联邦将给两国人民带来的利益时说，联邦将导致加强他们的立场、统一他们对帝国主义的斗争、把他们的解放政策建立在健全的基础上并且帮助解放阿拉伯的其他地方、建设他们已经解放了的国家、增加他们在国际事务中的作用以利于阿拉伯事业和世界和平事业。
    决议说，联邦的实现应该导致同社会主义阵营国家保持友好关系，因为阿拉伯事业会从这种友谊得到重大的好处。
    决议指出，帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义现在是阿拉伯民族主义的主要威胁。决议说：“美帝国主义正在尽最大的努力来迫使（埃及和叙利亚）两国改变他们的解放独立政策，并且正在设法把它们拉到它的行列中去，毁掉它们的独立和未来。”
    关于成立联邦的方法，决议说，“叙利亚和埃及政府应该立即成立联合委员会，从各个方面和各个角度来研究联邦的各种形式”，“要考虑到每个国家的客观条件，设法使它们协调和谐和，以消除可以被联邦的敌人利用来进行破坏活动的任何空子”。
    决议最后指出，加强叙利亚的民族阵线是实现联邦的基本因素。
    叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会在关于加强叙利亚民族阵线的决议中强调指出了叙利亚民族主义力量团结的重要性。决议说：“叙利亚经历的所有事情证明，如果不是团结一致，如果全国不是在民族阵线上结成一条线，叙利亚就不能屹立在帝国主义阴谋和它的条约前面。”
    决议指出，美帝国主义者并没有改变它的侵略政策。美国还在强迫别人接受艾森豪威尔主义和巴格达条约，而且还想在巴格达条约国家设立导弹基地。决议说，美帝国主义者为了实现它的阴谋，正在向叙利亚民族阵线开火以便在民族阵线党派间制造分裂和紧张。美帝国主义者正在设法制造无根据的分歧并且扩大不足以影响民族阵线的重大目的的那些普通而简单的分歧。同时，他们开始赶忙让他们的代理人采用阿拉伯解放口号，作得好像他们是这种政策的拥护者一样，以便找机会摧毁民族阵线。
    决议说，民族阵线的首要任务就是击败美帝国主义对叙利亚的阴谋。
    决议说，非常明显，叙利亚目前所遭受的危机情况和帝国主义对叙利亚的威胁，迫使全国各个政党和组织的爱国人士，特别是共产党人，把支持和加强民族阵线的工作当作他们肩头上的最严重的民族责任。
