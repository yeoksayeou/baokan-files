Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: According to a report by the German News Agency, the proposal by Democratic German Prime Minister Grotewohl for a referendum on establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in both Germanys has been widely welcomed by the masses in East and West Germany.

One of the leaders of the West German "Alliance Against Atomic Disaster," Dr. Mannstedt, which has 500,000 members, said that Grotewohl's proposal is "completely suitable for discussion." He pointed out that most West German residents have already indicated their opposition to atomic weapons in polls conducted by public opinion survey agencies.

The Secretary-General of the West German "German League," Weber, believes that only through a referendum can the true will of the people be understood. He said: "Without asking the people, neither the Federal Parliament nor the Federal Government has the right to decide on the issue of atomic armament."

The manager of a film company in Düsseldorf, Dahl, said that holding a referendum simultaneously in East and West Germany is "beneficial." He believes that Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone "fully conforms to the interests of the German people."

Representatives of the "German Doctors for Peace Association," who were meeting in Berlin, passed a resolution on the 23rd, supporting the proposal for a referendum, and called on colleagues throughout Germany to do the same.

The Chairman of the Executive Committee of the "Free German Trade Union Federation" of Democratic Germany, Warnke, gave a speech, instructing trade union organizations in various special zones, counties, and enterprises of Democratic Germany to study how to disseminate the proposal for a referendum in West Germany and how to win the support of West German workers for this proposal through writing letters, sending delegations, and broadcasting. Warnke also demanded that trade union organizations in Democratic Germany conduct full discussions on Prime Minister Grotewohl's proposal.

    全德国群众都不要原子武器
    欢迎格罗提渥建议赞成举行全民投票
    新华社25日讯　据德意志通讯社报道，民主德国总理格罗提渥最近关于在两个德国境内就建立无原子武器区问题举行全民投票的建议受到了东西德群众的广泛欢迎。
    西德拥有五十万会员的“反对原子灾害战斗同盟”负责人之一曼斯坦博士说，格罗提渥的建议是“完全适合于讨论的”。他指出，大多数西德居民在民意测验机关的调查中已经表明他们反对原子武器。
    西德“德国人联盟”秘书长魏伯认为，只有通过全民投票才能弄明白人民真正的意愿。他说：“在没有问过人民之前，无论是联邦议院还是联邦政府都无权决定有关原子武装的问题。”
    杜塞尔多夫市一家影片公司的经理戴尔说，在东西德境内同时举行全民投票是“有益的”。他认为波兰关于建立无原子武器区的建议“完全符合德国人民的利益”。
    正在柏林开会的“德国医生和平协会”的代表们在23日通过决议，支持举行全民投票的建议，并且呼吁全德各地的同行都这样做。
    民主德国“自由德国工会联合会”执行委员会主席瓦恩克发表谈话，责成民主德国各专区、各县和各企业中的工会组织研究如何在西德传播有关举行全民投票的主张以及如何通过写信、派代表团和广播等方式去争取西德工人支持这个主张。瓦恩克还要求民主德国的工会组织就格罗提渥总理的建议进行充分讨论。
