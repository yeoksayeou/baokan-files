　　The Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Forest Industries Hold Exhibition of Evidence of Corruption by Grafters

　　(By our newspaper) Recently, the Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Forest Industries, in the course of the rectification movement, exposed some cases of corruption within the departments. In order to broadly educate the masses, they held an "Exhibition of Evidence of Corruption by Grafters" using the materials of six grafters, including Ma Deguang.

　　The exhibition displayed a large number of赃物 (corrupted goods) and赃款 (corrupted money) from these grafters. For example, Ma Deguang (the former accountant of the Forestry Cadre School) alone embezzled as much as 14,000 yuan, and the corrupted goods were displayed in a whole room. The exhibition exposed the various despicable means used by the grafters to forge receipts and bills, as well as their consistent corrupt and degenerate lifestyle. In addition, it also served as a warning to the leaders who were blinded by bureaucracy through concrete facts.
