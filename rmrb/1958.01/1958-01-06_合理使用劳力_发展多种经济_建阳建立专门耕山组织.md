    Rationally Use Labor, Develop Diversified Economy:
    Jianyang Establishes Specialized Mountain Cultivation Organizations
    (Reported by this newspaper) To adapt to the characteristic of insufficient labor for diversified operations in the mountainous areas of Jianyang County, Fujian Province, 50 agricultural cooperatives have established mountain cultivation organizations. This type of labor organization demonstrates greater advantages than general mixed farming and forestry labor organizations. Forestry income in Jianyang County accounts for 30% of the total income. During the busy farming season, the phenomenon of emphasizing agriculture and neglecting forestry often occurs. In order to solve this contradiction, local agricultural cooperatives have extracted some experienced farmers from the production teams to specialize in afforestation on the mountains and are responsible for nurturing management, intercropping miscellaneous grains and other work. At present, 50 mountain cultivation teams have been organized throughout the county. From the experience of agricultural cooperatives that have organized mountain cultivation teams, it generally plays a significant role: First, it overcomes the phenomenon of emphasizing agriculture and neglecting forestry, which often leads to neglecting one over the other. In Huilong District, which has organized more mountain cultivation teams, 1,600 mu of forest were planted last year, and the 13 mountain cultivation teams planted more than 1,100 mu, with income from tea and intercropped miscellaneous grains reaching more than 60,000 yuan, and the average production value of each laborer reaching more than 500 yuan. Second, organizing mountain cultivation teams can rationally use labor. Many productions in mountainous areas, such as planting miscellaneous grains and weeding, are suitable for women and semi-laborers to do. After organizing mountain cultivation teams, full laborers can concentrate on cultivating fields, and semi-laborers can concentrate on cultivating mountains. Third, agricultural cooperatives have generally increased their income by rationally arranging work and fully using labor. Last year, the Lianmeng Cooperative of Shuiji Town in this county increased grain production by 4%, the output value of sideline production increased by 30%, and the income from forestry production increased by one and a half times compared with the previous year. Intercropping sweet potatoes, corn, tung seeds, citrus, etc. on the mountains yielded an income of 4,400 yuan. (Lei Pu)

    合理使用劳力　发展多种经济
    建阳建立专门耕山组织
    本报讯　福建山区建阳县有五十个农业社，为适应山区多种经营劳力不足的特点，建立了耕山组织。这种劳动组织比一般农林业混合经营的劳动组织，表现出更大的优越性。建阳县林业收入占整个收入的30％。在农忙时，常常发生重农轻林的现象。当地农业社为了解决这个矛盾，从生产队中抽出一些老农专门上山造林，并且负责进行抚育管理，间种杂粮等工作。目前，全县已组织了五十个耕山队。从已组织耕山队的农业社的经验看，一般都发挥了显著的作用：首先，克服了顾此失彼重农轻林现象。组织耕山队较多的回龙区，去年造林一千六百亩，而十三个耕山队就造了一千一百多亩，茶叶和间种杂粮收入达六万多元，每个劳力平均生产价值达五百多元。其次，组织耕山队能够合理使用劳力。山区很多生产，如种杂粮锄草等，是适宜妇女和半劳力去做的。组织耕山队以后，就可以使全劳力集中耕田，半劳力集中耕山。第三，农业社因合理安排工作，充分使用劳力而普遍增加了收入。去年这县水吉镇联盟社，粮食增产了4％，副业产值增加了30％，而林业生产收入比前年提高了一倍半。在山上间种蕃薯、玉蜀黍、桐子、柑桔等，就获得四千四百元收入。　（雷普）
