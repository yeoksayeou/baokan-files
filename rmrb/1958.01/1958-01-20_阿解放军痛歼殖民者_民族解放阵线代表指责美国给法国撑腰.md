Xinhua News Agency, January 19th, Algiers dispatch: The Algerian National Liberation Army has achieved successive victories in battles against French colonial troops.

The Liberation Army won a battle that occurred on the 18th in Orléansville. According to an official announcement by the French army, twenty-eight officers and soldiers of a French artillery regiment were killed, and another twelve are missing.

A few days earlier, in eastern Algeria, a French patrol was ambushed by a strong Liberation Army unit supported by mortars. The French side announced that fourteen French soldiers were killed in the battle.

Lamine Debaghine, a representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, said at a press conference held in Cairo on the 17th that any solution to the Algerian problem should be based on the recognition of Algerian independence. He accused the United States of helping France and thus indirectly participating in the massacre of Algerians. He pointed out that without U.S. financial aid, France would not be able to continue the Algerian War. In answering questions, Debaghine mentioned that three-quarters of the weapons of the Algerian National Liberation Army were captured in battles with the French army.

    民族解放阵线代表指责美国给法国撑腰
    新华社19日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放军在同法国殖民军的战斗中接连取得胜利。
    18日发生在奥尔良斯维尔的一次战斗中，解放军获胜。据法军官方宣布，法军一个炮兵团的二十八名官兵被击毙，另外还有十二人下落不明。
    几天前，在阿尔及利亚东部，法军巡逻部队遭到一支在迫击炮支持下的强有力的解放军部队围攻。法军方面宣布，法军有十四人在战斗中被击毙。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表拉明·德巴京17日在开罗举行的记者招待会上说，阿尔及利亚问题的任何解决办法，都应当以承认阿尔及利亚独立为基础。他指责美国帮助法国，因而在间接参加屠杀阿尔及利亚人。他指出，如果没有美国的财政援助，法国就不可能继续进行阿尔及利亚战争。德巴京在答复问题时提到，阿尔及利亚民族解放军四分之三的武器是在同法军作战时缴获的。
