    Eliminate Yellow Songs
    Our Newspaper Commentator
    Last year, when the bourgeois rightists distorted the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and launched a rampant attack on the Party and the people, a gust of yellow music began to blow in more than a dozen large cities in our country. Many songs that had been praised by the Kuomintang reactionary rulers and Japanese imperialists in the old society, reflecting the slavish consciousness of the bureaucratic comprador class and the decadent hedonistic ideology of the bourgeoisie, were revived and spread widely. At a time when our people are advancing towards socialism, this countercurrent is promoting various kinds of bourgeois decadent and decadent ideological sentiments, attempting to disintegrate our firm will to build a socialist society ideologically. The situation is serious and intolerable.
    Yellow songs were originally a kind of reactionary culture produced in my country's semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. Generally speaking, it serves the corrupt and degenerate bourgeoisie, foreign slaves and compradors, and enemy and puppet traitors. Although the reactionary and decadent degrees of these yellow songs are different, they all reflect the reactionary views and decadent and obscene ideological sentiments of the reactionary and declining classes under the guise of various themes, lyrics and melodies, and are used to corrupt and paralyze the fighting will of the working people. Specifically, some songs have obvious traitorous consciousness and reactionary colors in politics, and are essentially reactionary songs that use the guise of yellow songs to instill traitorous and slavish consciousness; some openly promote pornography, money worship, hedonism, and decadent thoughts and lifestyles of the decadent bourgeoisie; and some take the lives of people at the bottom of the old society as their themes, but in essence, they uglify the working people, thereby expressing the bourgeois and petty bourgeois's affectation, decadent and sentimental moods. These songs are all decadent and decadent in sentiment. They either use a chaotic beat, changes in extremely strong and extremely weak rhythms, or vulgar glissandos, and unhealthy licentious sentiments, combined with obscene lyrics, to spread decadent emotions, giving people sensory and carnal stimulation. These yellow songs were already spurned by every youth with national consciousness and ambition, and criticized and despised by progressive and upright musicians during my country's new democratic revolution. Only in the enemy and puppet-occupied areas and among the Kuomintang reactionaries, bureaucratic compradors, the bourgeoisie, and those eroded by their decadent thoughts who were shrinking in the anti-Japanese rear, could yellow music find its market. Now, when we are fighting together with the people of the world for world peace and anti-colonialism, how can we allow someone to sing "Manchurian Girl" in front of us, which contains reactionary content and flatters the invaders, and "China Nights," which fully expresses the Japanese imperialists' ambition to invade? We cannot tolerate that while the people of the whole country are striving for socialist construction, yellow songs promote the bourgeois idea of enjoying life to the fullest, "have wine today, be drunk today." What we advocate is building the country and managing the family diligently and thriftily, but yellow songs vigorously promote the bourgeois decadent and depraved lifestyle of "drunkenness and extravagance are more leisurely" and "feasting and drinking are better than gods." We advocate serving the people wholeheartedly and despise the ugly qualities of the bourgeoisie who are only interested in profit, but yellow songs promote money worship, saying, "Even gods are in love with copper coins, who in life is not for copper coins." We encourage healthy and pure love life, but yellow songs spread obscene words such as "family flowers are not as fragrant as wild flowers," leading people to the path of moral corruption. This strong contrast can clearly illustrate the essence and harm of yellow songs. It is incompatible with the socialist system and the ideological and moral character of the people of our country. Yellow songs are simply a poison that kills people without using a knife for the working people in socialist society!
    Today, under the socialist system, the class foundation for the production of yellow songs has been destroyed, but its ideological influence still exists. Especially when the bourgeois rightists are launching a rampant attack on us, the resurrection and proliferation of yellow songs is by no means accidental. Some people attempt to distort the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" with the viewpoints of bourgeois revisionism to defend yellow songs. They believe that yellow songs could not be broadcast and sung in the past only because of the suppression of dogmatists, and they demanded that yellow songs be "unbanned" and allowed to "bloom." Some people dare not obviously deny that yellow songs are poisonous weeds, but with infinite nostalgia, they euphemistically say that there may still be fragrant flowers in them, and they demand that these songs be re-evaluated, and they try their best to dig out some to sing. We do not deny that in the old society, in addition to songs for national salvation, there were indeed some popular songs with certain progressive contents. They made accusations against the old society with relatively real emotions. Works like "Fisherman's Song" are relatively profound and touching in terms of ideological depth and artistic image depiction, and are completely different from yellow songs in essence. As for some songs that reflect the lives of progressive intellectuals and petty citizens in the old society, such as "Lang Li Ge Lang," although they do not have much progressive content, they were still a singable popular song at that time, and should also be distinguished from yellow songs. There are also some songs, such as "Sending My Lover," which are actually similar to the folk song "Walking to the West Exit," but only because of the singer's slick tone did they become unhealthy songs. However, in any case, the era reflected by this kind of song will never return. Today, no matter from its content to its artistic image, it has been greatly separated from the spiritual outlook of the people today. It is inappropriate to overemphasize the singing of these popular songs. Some people regard yellow songs as general popular songs to spread, opening the door to yellow songs. In name, it is to meet the needs of the people in many aspects, but in fact, it has the effect of opening the door to thieves. Judging from some articles published in local newspapers and periodicals, there are many people who intentionally or unintentionally defend yellow songs. They say, "A few old songs will not bring down the youth," and some even clamor to "abolish the name of yellow songs," "Do not say that the bourgeois lifestyle is absurd," and "Due to the decision of stand and emotion, it is entirely possible to transform bourgeois songs into the property of the people." The rightist, the author of the notorious yellow song "When Will You Come Again," Liu Xue'an, once attempted to distort the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and clamored to re-evaluate yellow songs such as "When Will You Come Again." The bourgeois stand of this kind of person is open and obvious. It must be pointed out that the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is premised on being beneficial to the socialist cause. It is for the prosperity of socialist culture and art, not for the prosperity of capitalist culture and art. People's identification of fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds is based on class interests. For us, only flowers that conform to the interests of the working class are fragrant flowers, and the toxicity of the poisonous weed of yellow songs is extremely obvious. The policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" encourages the opening of fragrant flowers, not poisonous weeds. If there are poisonous weeds, they must be weeded out. On this issue, we have no common language with bourgeois advisers. Today, the struggle against yellow songs is a struggle between two lines on the music front, and it is also an important aspect of the political and ideological struggle against bourgeois rightists.
    Our people are all people who love socialist construction, and what we need are artistic works with high ideological content and vivid and touching artistic images, so as to better cultivate communist ideological and moral character and better carry out socialist construction. We hope that young people in society will be vigilant at all times and not be fooled by the bourgeoisie. At the same time, our composers, lyricists and artists have a major responsibility in this regard and should write more and better works so that the people can have a noble and healthy cultural life. At the same time, we hope that the relevant cultural authorities can take effective measures and take actions simultaneously from the aspects of creation, publishing work, administration, especially public opinion. Because yellow songs are different from yellow books and periodicals and bad dramas, they are not as easy to solve as a drama or a book. Bad dramas and bad books can not be performed and published, but yellow songs are easily spread by word of mouth. Only by first mobilizing the broad masses through public opinion and working together can we finally send yellow songs to the garbage dump of history.

    肃清黄色歌曲
    本报评论员
    去年，当资产阶级右派分子歪曲百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，大肆向党和人民猖狂进攻的时候，在我国的十几个大城市里开始刮起了黄色音乐的阴风，不少曾经在旧社会中为国民党反动统治者和日本帝国主义者所赞赏过的、反映着官僚买办阶级的奴才意识和资产阶级颓废享乐主义思想的歌曲又死灰复燃，泛滥起来。当我国人民正在向社会主义大进军的时候，这股逆流却宣扬着各种各样的资产阶级没落、颓废的思想感情，企图从思想上来瓦解我们建设社会主义社会的坚定意志，情况是严重的，不可容忍的。
    黄色歌曲原是产生在我国半封建半殖民地社会时期的一种反动文化。总的说来，它是为腐化堕落的资产阶级、洋奴买办和敌伪汉奸服务的。尽管这些黄色歌曲的反动、堕落的程度各有不同，但都是在各种各样的题材、词句和旋律的掩饰下，反映了反动、没落阶级的反动观点和萎靡、淫秽的思想感情，并且被利用来腐蚀、麻醉劳动人民的斗争意志。具体分析起来，有些歌曲在政治上带有明显的汉奸意识和反动色彩，实质上已经是一些借着黄色歌曲的外衣来灌输汉奸奴才意识的反动歌曲；有些公开地宣扬色情，宣扬金钱至上，宣扬享乐主义，宣扬消极颓废等资产阶级腐朽、没落的思想和生活方式；也有些是以旧社会下层人民的生活为题材，实质上是丑化劳动人民，借此以表现资产阶级和小资产阶级的无病呻吟、没落伤感的情调。这些歌曲在情调上都是萎靡、颓废的。它们或者是以一种错乱的节拍、特强特弱的节奏的变换，或者是以庸俗的滑音，和不健康的放荡的情调，配合着淫荡的词句，散播着颓废的感情，给人以感官上和肉欲上的刺激。这些黄色歌曲早在我国新民主主义革命时期，就已经被每一个有民族觉悟和有志气的青年所唾弃，为进步的正直的音乐家所批判和鄙视。只有在敌伪占领区和龟缩在抗敌大后方的国民党反动派、官僚买办、资产阶级以及受他们腐朽思想所侵蚀的人那里，黄色音乐才能够找到它的市场。现在，当我们正在和全世界人民一起为了世界和平、为了反殖民主义而奋斗的时候，我们怎么能够容许有人在我们面前播唱内容反动、为侵略者献媚的“满洲姑娘”和充分表现了日本帝国主义者侵略野心的“支那之夜”呢？我们也不能容忍，当全国人民正在为社会主义建设事业而努力奋斗的时候，而黄色歌曲却宣扬“今朝有酒今朝醉”的及时行乐的资产阶级思想。我们提倡的是勤俭建国、勤俭持家，黄色歌曲却大肆推崇“纸醉金迷多优游”“花天酒地，赛过神仙”的资产阶级腐朽、靡烂的生活方式。我们提倡全心全意地为人民服务，鄙弃资产阶级的唯利是图的丑恶品质，黄色歌曲却宣传金钱至上，说甚么“神仙尚把铜钱恋，人生谁不为铜钱”。我们鼓励健康、纯洁的爱情生活，黄色歌曲却散播“家花那有野花香”等淫词滥调，引人走上道德败坏之途。这种强烈的对比已经可以清楚地说明了黄色歌曲的本质和它的危害性，它和社会主义社会制度是水火不相容的，和我国人民群众的思想品德是水火不相容的。黄色歌曲对于社会主义社会的劳动人民，简直是一剂杀人不用刀的毒药！
    今天，在社会主义社会制度下，产生黄色歌曲的那种阶级基础是被摧垮了，但它的思想影响仍然存在着，特别是在资产阶级右派分子向我们猖狂进攻的时候，黄色歌曲的死灰复燃与泛滥绝不是偶然的。有些人企图用资产阶级修正主义的观点来歪曲“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，为黄色歌曲辩护。他们认为过去只是由于教条主义者的压制，黄色歌曲才不能播唱，要求为黄色歌曲“开禁”，让黄色歌曲也“放”出来。有些人则不敢明显否认黄色歌曲是毒草，而带有无限依恋的心情，转弯抹角地说这里面可能还有香花，要求对这些歌曲重新估价，千方百计地希望在这里面挖出一些来唱唱。我们不否认，在旧社会中除了救亡歌曲以外，确还存在着一些具有一定进步内容的流行歌曲，它们以比较真实的感情对旧社会进行了控诉，像“渔光曲”那样的作品，无论在思想深度与艺术形象的刻划方面，都是比较深刻感人的，在本质上与黄色歌曲完全不同。至于有些反映了旧社会中追求进步的知识分子与小市民生活的歌曲如“郎里格郎”等，虽然没有多少进步的内容，但在当时也还不失为一首可唱的流行歌曲，也应该和黄色歌曲区别开来。也有一些歌曲如“送情郎”，实际上和民歌“走西口”相似，只是由于唱者的油腔滑调，才变成了不健康的歌曲。但是，无论如何，这种歌曲所反映的时代是一去不复返了，今天看来，无论从它的内容到艺术形象，都已经和今天人民的精神面貌有了很大的距离，过分多地强调演唱这些流行歌曲是不适当的。有些人把黄色歌曲也当作一般流行歌曲来传播，向黄色歌曲敞开了大门，名义上是为了满足人民群众多方面的需要，实际上却起了开门揖盗的效果。从各地报刊发表的一些文章来看，这种有意无意地为黄色歌曲申辩的人是不少的，他们说甚么“几支旧歌不会把青年拖倒”，甚至还有人叫嚣“取消黄色歌曲的名称”，“不要把资产阶级的生活方式说成是荒唐”，“由于立场和感情的决定，完全可以化资产阶级歌为人民所有”。右派分子、臭名远扬的黄色歌曲“何日君再来”的作者刘雪庵，就曾企图歪曲“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，叫嚣把“何日君再来”等黄色歌曲加以重新估价。这种人的资产阶级立场，是公开而且明显的。必须指出：“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针是以有利于社会主义事业为前提的，它是为了社会主义文化艺术的繁荣而不是为了资本主义文化艺术的繁荣。人们对于香花和毒草的鉴别，是以阶级利益为标尺的。对我们来说，只有符合工人阶级利益的花才是香花，而黄色歌曲这株毒草的毒性却至为明显。“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针鼓励开放的是香花而不是毒草，有了毒草就得锄草。在这个问题上，我们和资产阶级谋士之间没有共同的语言。今天，对待黄色歌曲的斗争，是音乐战线上两条路线的斗争，也是反对资产阶级右派分子的政治思想斗争中的一个重要方面。
    我们的人民都是热爱社会主义建设事业的人，我们需要的是思想性高和艺术形象生动感人的艺术作品，以便更好地培养共产主义的思想品德和更好地进行社会主义建设。我们希望社会青年们时刻警惕，不要上资产阶级的当。同时，我们的作曲家、作词家和艺术家们在这方面有着重大的责任，应该写出更多的更好的作品来，使人民得到高尚健康的文化生活。同时，希望有关的文化主管部门能够采取有效的措施，从创作上、出版工作上、行政上特别是舆论上，同时采取行动。因为黄色歌曲与黄色书刊、坏戏不同，不像一出戏或一本书那样容易解决。坏戏和坏书可以不演和不出版，但黄色歌曲却容易在人们的口头流传。只有首先通过舆论，发动广大群众，一起动手，才能够把黄色歌曲最后送进历史的垃圾堆里去。
