Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 8th -- Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein said on the 8th that his experiences visiting the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries have proven that Burma's neutral foreign policy is correct. He said that Burma has not joined any bloc, and it believes that it can and agrees to coexist peacefully with other countries.

The Deputy Prime Minister returned to Rangoon on January 6th after visiting seven socialist countries. U Kyaw Nyein said that the socialist countries' experience in developing modern industry in agricultural countries, establishing cooperatives after land reform, and establishing new land systems are worth learning from by Burma.

In a written statement released at a press conference, U Kyaw Nyein announced that the Soviet Union had agreed to help Burma build two dams and an agricultural machinery factory, and would provide Burma with loans of approximately 35 to 40 million kyats to pay for the costs of these projects. The interest rate on the Soviet loans will be 2.5%. He said that the Chinese government has agreed to help Burma build a 40,000-spindle textile mill, and the construction costs will be loaned to Burma by China at an interest rate of 2.5%.

U Kyaw Nyein emphasized that these loans are economic assistance to help Burma build its own industry and improve agricultural production in the short term. He believes that after the textile mill is completed, it will not only reduce imports of foreign textiles but also help the development of Burma's textile industry.

In response to a question about the Sino-Burmese border, U Kyaw Nyein said that because of the close and friendly relations between China and Burma, all issues between the two countries can be resolved on a friendly basis.

    吴觉迎谈访问社会主义国家观感
    宣布苏中将给缅甸经济援助
    新华社仰光8日电　缅甸副总理吴觉迎8日说，他在访问苏联、中华人民共和国以及其他社会主义国家时取得的经验证明，缅甸的中立外交政策是正确的。他说，缅甸没有参加任何集团，它相信可以并且同意同其他国家和平共处。
    这位副总理在访问了七个社会主义国家以后，在1月6日回到仰光。吴觉迎说，社会主义国家在农业国家里发展现代工业的经验、在土地改革以后成立合作社的经验以及建立新的土地制度的经验是值得缅甸学习的。
    吴觉迎在记者招待会上发表的书面谈话中宣布，苏联已经答应帮助缅甸修建两座水坝和一座农业机器厂，并且将给缅甸约三千五百万至四千万缅元的贷款，用来支付这些工程的费用。苏联贷款的利率将为2.5％。他说，中国政府同意帮助缅甸修建一座四万纱锭的纺织厂，建厂费用将按2.5％的利率由中国贷给缅甸。
    吴觉迎强调说，这些贷款是帮助缅甸建设自己的工业和在短期内改进农业生产的一种经济援助。他相信，建成这座纺织厂以后，不仅可以减少外国纺织品进口，而且还有助于缅甸纺织工业的发展。
    吴觉迎在回答关于中缅边境的问题时说，由于中国和缅甸之间有着密切的友好关系，两国间的一切问题都是能够在友好的基础上解决的。
