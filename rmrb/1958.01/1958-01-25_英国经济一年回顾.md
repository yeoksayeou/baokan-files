A review of the British economy over the past year has recently been published in British newspapers. The situation reflected by these figures has made British authorities and bourgeois economists realize that the question facing Britain now is not whether an economic recession will come, but how wide a scope it will have and how long it will last.

    **Unstable Pound Sterling**

The instability of the pound sterling is the most prominent fact of the British economy in 1957. In August and September of last year, the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the US dollar fell to the lowest level of the official price. In just two months, Britain's gold and dollar reserves lost more than $531 million. By the end of September, Britain's reserves had fallen to $1.85 billion, which was not only much less than the reserves during the Suez War, but also the lowest level since June 1952. Therefore, the so-called "defending the pound" became the center of all British government policies. Only after the British government raised the bank interest rate to 7% and took a series of other economic measures did the situation improve slightly. The exchange rate of the pound sterling reached the official parity on October 7, and gold and dollar reserves also increased month by month, reaching $2.273 billion by the end of December.

However, it is very unrealistic to think that the British government's measures have fundamentally reversed Britain's financial situation. Because the officially published figures for gold and dollar reserves do not represent Britain's true reserve strength. Britain's existing $2.273 billion includes the following items: 1. $176 million in loans owed but not yet paid to the United States and Canada; 2. $500 million in loans from the US Export-Import Bank; 3. £225 million deposited by India in the "City of London" (India has repeatedly stated that it wants to withdraw this amount). If these figures are removed, then Britain's gold and dollar reserves are only about $960 million. And bourgeois economists usually regard $2 billion in reserves as the minimum figure for stabilizing the pound sterling.

For the "City of London," an even more cruel fact is that Britain's existing gold and dollar reserves (more than $2.2 billion, equivalent to about £800 million) are only about 23% of Britain's liabilities. The liabilities referred to here are pound sterling deposits from overseas, totaling £3.5 billion. Among them, deposits belonging to the sterling area are about £2.925 billion. Due to a lack of confidence in the pound sterling, deposits in non-sterling areas have fallen from £1 billion in previous years to £560 million. Therefore, even "The Times" cannot but admit: "Unless this situation changes fundamentally, we will not be 'masters in our own house', we will not be 'masters of our currency'."

This is the real situation of Britain's gold and dollar reserves. However, in analyzing the pound sterling crisis last autumn, the following two factors must also be pointed out:

First, it should be understood that, in addition to Britain, the pound sterling first serves as the currency of the sterling area; at the same time, it also serves as a means of currency payment for trade in half of the capitalist world. This exposes the pound sterling to economic pressures outside of Britain's scope, so any disturbance will directly hit the pound sterling. Britain has long faced an unpleasant fact: due to its trade surplus, West Germany's gold and dollar reserves have been rising sharply. Since January 1957, West Germany's gold and dollar reserves and the balance in the European Payments Union have increased by more than $1.5 billion, while in the same period, Britain has decreased by $300 million. This not only shows the weakening of Britain's competitiveness in the international market, but also creates a situation where the mark is too "hard" and the pound sterling is too "soft". By August of last year, the devaluation of the franc had dealt a severe blow to the pound sterling: the international market lacked confidence in the pound sterling, and a large number of pounds sterling were converted into US dollars or marks.

Second, in order to stabilize the pound sterling, Britain must earn a large amount of foreign exchange. However, Britain's foreign trade cannot bear this task. In the past year, Britain has tried its best to expand exports, restrict imports, and tighten domestic spending in order to strive for a surplus. It relied on lowering import prices, raising export prices, and the help of invisible trade such as shipping and insurance to achieve a balance of international payments. It is estimated that in the year from June 1956 to June 1957, Britain obtained a trade surplus of £211 million. It is far from enough for Britain to expand overseas investment, repay debts, and increase reserves with this surplus alone. In the past four and a half years, long-term overseas investment has exceeded foreign exchange surplus by £115 million. That is to say, overseas investment has greatly exceeded the trade surplus figure. On this issue, Britain faces a dilemma: if it reduces overseas investment, then Britain will not be able to maintain the Commonwealth countries economically, and these countries' ties with Britain have loosened to the point of disintegration. If this surplus is not used to stabilize the pound sterling, then the "stability" of the pound sterling can only rely on various debts to maintain it. Obviously, this is an unsolvable contradiction for the British government.

    **Sluggish Foreign Trade**

Britain is a country that lives on foreign trade. Its total foreign trade is approximately equal to 30% of the entire national income. The United States only accounts for 5%, and West Germany and Japan only account for 14% and 11%, respectively. However, due to the British government's policy of restricting trade with the East and the intensification of competition among international monopoly capital to seize markets, especially the intensification of competition from the powerful United States and West Germany, which has recovered from defeat, Britain has encountered increasing pressure in the international market.

The general situation of Britain's foreign trade in 1957 can be summarized into the following characteristics: 1. The speed of development has become slower and slower; 2. The proportion of Britain's exports in the capitalist world market has greatly declined; 3. Britain's exports to sterling area countries are being gradually squeezed out, and these countries are of particular importance to the British economy.

If Britain's exports in 1957 are calculated by quantity, they increased by 2% compared with the previous year; if they are calculated by price, they increased by 5.5%. However, it should be pointed out that export prices rose by 4.5% during the year, so the actual increase was only 1%. On the import side, despite the British government's careful calculations, the deficit has widened compared to last year. The deficit in 1956 was £568 million, but it increased to £620 million in 1957. West Germany's trade exports increased by 16% from 1955 to 1956, and the total value of the first ten months of 1957 increased by 18% compared to the same period in 1956.

With the slow and stagnant development of foreign trade, the proportion of Britain's export trade in the entire capitalist world is declining. In 1953, the percentage accounted for by the United Kingdom was 21.2, in 1954 it was 20.4, in 1955 it was 19.7, in 1956 it was 19.0, in the first half of 1957 it was 18.3, and in the second half of 1957, the proportion of trade accounted for by the United Kingdom continued to decline.

After West German monopoly capital, supported by the United States, re-emerged on the international competitive stage, it made it increasingly difficult for Britain to export to the Western European market. The trade prosperity created by Britain's victory over Germany after the war is gone forever. Even in the Western European market, comparing the first half of 1954 with the first half of 1956, Britain's exports to this region only increased by 15%; while West Germany increased by 42%; and the United States increased by 36%.

Not only that, but in the sterling area, which was originally a traditional market for Britain, US and West German monopoly capital are also deepening step by step, gradually replacing Britain. At the same time, due to the development of industries in other member states of the Commonwealth, Britain's relations with other Commonwealth members are far from what they used to be.

Last year, Australia relaxed tariffs on more than 800 items of goods and developed trade relations with other countries. New Zealand also relaxed tariffs. As a result, imperial preference is on the verge of disintegration in these countries. As a result, American goods flooded the Australian and New Zealand markets.

Due to the infiltration of US and West German monopoly capital, their exports to the sterling area are increasing day by day, and the proportion of British goods in the population of these countries is decreasing day by day. Comparing January to June 1957 with the same period in 1955, the share of British industrial products in the industrial product population of sterling area countries decreased by 5%. Comparing January to June 1957 with the same period in 1956, West Germany increased by 19% in the industrial product population of sterling area countries, the United States increased by 36%, and the proportion of the United Kingdom continued to decline.

The same phenomenon also occurred in Canada. Before the war, the United States exported three times as much to Canada as Britain; now it exports nine times as much as Britain. The Diefenbaker government in Canada planned to transfer 15% of Canada's imports from the United States to imports from Britain, and Canada sent a huge delegation to Britain, but this effort failed. This is mainly because Canada found that the "import and export needs of the two countries do not match."

    **Decline in Industrial Production, Reduction in Domestic Investment**

Due to the British government's adoption of a tight credit policy and the sluggish foreign trade, Britain's industrial production has basically stagnated over the past year. The industrial production index in 1957 is estimated to have increased by only about 1%. But this is mainly due to the increase in production in industries such as steel, chemicals, and machinery. In the past year, Britain's steel production increased by about 5%, the chemical industry increased by 6.2%, and the machinery industry increased by 2%; on the other hand, the production of non-ferrous metals, shipbuilding, electrical, and aircraft industries decreased significantly. This fully reveals the anarchy of capitalist production and the extreme imbalance of development.

The industrial production situation in 1957 shows that the so-called "post-war prosperity" of the British economy is nearing its end. It is worth noting that Britain's steel consumption has reached saturation. Orders for working machine tools have been declining for fifteen months. According to the current level of orders, they are only enough for ten months of production, and demand is still declining. Due to the increase in installment payment debts (£400 million in 1957, an average of about £8 per Briton), sales of durable consumer goods are decreasing day by day. In the face of such a situation, can Britain find a "way out" by expanding the arms race? Based on Britain's specific situation, this prospect is bleak. Currently, Britain's military expenditure is £1.5 billion per year. In order for the expansion of armaments to have a further stimulating effect on Britain, military expenditure must be greatly increased, which is difficult for British finances to bear. It should be pointed out that some industries in Britain are currently completely dependent on government military orders to maintain themselves. But this is by no means a "panacea" for curing capitalist diseases. For example, due to changes in defense policy, the British aircraft industry is currently facing a crisis.

While industrial production is stagnating, the profits of British enterprises, except for a few large companies, have generally declined significantly. The profits of enterprises in 1957 decreased by about 20% compared with the previous year. This inevitably leads to a significant reduction in the growth rate of investment. Investment increased by 23% in 1955 compared with the previous year, increased by 20% in 1956, and was originally planned to increase by 7% in 1957. Since the total figures have not yet been published, it is not yet possible to determine exactly how much, but people are generally skeptical about this. Because the investment growth rate in the first quarter of last year was only 5%, and only 3% in the second quarter. The area of newly built factories decreased by 10.5% in the first nine months of 1957 compared with the same period in 1956. The increase in bank interest rates and the announcement of the freezing of investment in "nationalized" industries have further deteriorated this situation. The construction area in the fourth quarter decreased by 4.1 million square feet compared with the third quarter.

In reviewing the British economy in 1957, it is impossible not to mention the impact of the recession in capitalist world economic activity on Britain. At present, the overproduction in many industrial sectors in the United States is the first time since 1953. The so-called "prosperity" after the war has come to an end in the United States and other countries (such as West Germany). The direct impact on Britain is: 1. Competition in the capitalist world market is more intense than ever before. American industrial products are dumped abroad by all means, while imports are reduced. The US market accounts for 10% of Britain's total exports. 2. The recession in economic activity in the capitalist world—first and foremost the United States—has caused world raw material prices to plummet, falling by an average of 13%, and some raw materials have even fallen by more than 40%. This has greatly weakened the purchasing power of raw material producing countries. Importantly, most of the Commonwealth countries are raw material producing countries. In the past, Britain relied on it to earn US dollars, but now it is difficult to expect. In 1957, the trade deficit of all sterling countries other than the United Kingdom reached a huge £150 million!

Unstable pound sterling, sluggish foreign trade, stagnant industrial production, and declining domestic investment are the basic conditions of the British economy over the past year. It is not difficult to see how bleak the prospects facing Britain in 1958 are. The most optimistic estimate in the financial world for the pound sterling is "only look at six months," which means that the decline of the pound sterling may reappear in the second half of the year. In the capitalist world market, Britain will encounter increasingly fierce competition. Production may continue to stagnate. As for investment, the Treasury has announced that "it is impossible to increase," thus causing the "Financial Times" to lament: "This is a very regrettable thing, the decline in production investment means the decline in economic development." Unless the British government changes its overall policy, all its efforts will be in vain.

    英国经济一年回顾
    苏蓝　李一川
    有关英国经济过去一年的一些数字，最近已陆续在英国报上公布。这些数字所反映的情况，已使英国的当权人物和资产阶级经济学者认识到：现在摆在英国面前的，已不是经济萧条会不会来临的问题，而是它将具有多大的范围，并且要持续多久？
    英镑动荡不定
    英镑的不稳定，是1957年英国经济中最突出的事实。在去年8、9月间，英镑与美元的比价跌到了官方价格的最低标准。仅仅在两个月内，英国的黄金、美元储备丧失了五亿三千一百多万美元，到9月底，英国的储备降到十八亿五千万美元，这不仅比苏伊士战争时的储备少得多，而且是1952年6月以来的最低水平。于是，所谓“保卫英镑”，就成为英国政府一切政策的中心。当英国政府把银行利率提高到7％，并采取了其它一系列的经济措施后，形势才稍有好转。英镑的汇率在10月7日达到了官定比价，黄金、美元储备也逐月增加，到12月底，已达二十二亿七千三百万美元。
    但是，如果认为英国政府的措施已经根本扭转了英国的财政情况，那是非常不现实的。因为，官方公布的黄金、美元储备数字，并不能代表英国真正的后备力量。英国现存的二十二亿七千三百万美元，包括了以下款项：一、应付而未付的对美国和加拿大的一亿七千六百万美元的借款；二、美国进出口银行五亿美元的借款；三、印度存在“伦敦城”的二亿二千五百万英镑（印度已数度声称要提取这笔款项）。如果把这些数字除去，那末英国的黄金、美元储备，只不过九亿六千多万美元左右。而资产阶级的经济学家，通常是把二十亿美元的储备作为稳定英镑的最起码数字的。
    对于“伦敦城”来说，一个更残酷的事实是：英国现有的黄金、美元储备（二十二亿多美元，约合八亿英镑左右）的区区数字，只不过等于英国负债款项的23％左右。这里所指的负债，是来自海外各地的英镑存款，共三十五亿英镑。其中，属于英镑区的存款约二十九亿二千五百万英镑。由于对英镑的信心不足，非英镑区的存款已由往年的十亿英镑降至五亿六千万，因此，连“泰晤士报”也不能不承认：“除非这种情况根本改变，我们就不是‘我们家里的主人’，就不是
  ‘管理我们货币的主人’。”
    这就是英国黄金、美元储备的真实情况。但是，在分析去年秋季英镑危机时，还必须指出如下两个因素：
    第一，应该了解，除英国外，英镑首先作为英镑区的货币；同时，它还作为半个资本主义世界贸易的货币支付手段。这样，就把英镑暴露在英国范围之外的经济压力之下，因此一有风吹草动，英镑便受到直接的打击。英国长期以来面临着这样一个不愉快的事实：西德由于出超，黄金、美元储备直线上升。从1957年1月以来，西德黄金、美元储备以及在欧洲支付同盟中的平衡数字增加了十五亿多美元，而在同一时期，英国却下降了三亿美元。这不仅表明英国在国际市场上竞争能力的削弱，而且也形成了马克太“硬”、英镑太“软”的局面。到去年8月，法郎贬值，给英镑以严重的冲击：国际市场对英镑信心不足，大批英镑转换为美元或马克。
    第二，为了稳定英镑，英国必须大量赚取外汇。但是，英国的对外贸易，却不能担负这一任务。在去年一年中，英国极力扩大输出，限制输入，紧缩国内开支，以争取结余。它靠着压低进口价格，抬高出口价格以及航运和保险事业等无形贸易的帮助，才使得国际收支平衡。据估计，从1956年6月到1957年6月一年中，英国得到了二亿一千一百万英镑的贸易结余。英国要想扩大海外投资，偿还债务以及增加储备，只靠这点结余是远远不够的。在以往的四年半中，长期海外投资比外汇结余多一亿一千五百万英镑。这就是说，海外投资大大超过了贸易结余数字。在这一问题上，英国面临着一个难题：如果削减海外投资，那末英国就无法在经济上维系英联邦国家，而这些国家同英国的联系已经松弛到将要瓦解的程度。如果不把这一结余用来稳定英镑，那末英镑的“稳定”始终只能依靠各种各样的债款来维持。显然，这对英国政府来说是个无法解决的矛盾。
    对外贸易不振
    英国是一个靠对外贸易过活的国家，它的对外贸易总值大约等于整个国民收入的30％，美国只占5％，西德和日本也只占14％和11％。然而由于英国政府限制东西方贸易的政策和国际垄断资本争夺市场竞争的加剧，特别是强大的美国和从战败后重新恢复起来的西德竞争的加剧，英国在国际市场上已遭到了愈来愈大的压力。
    1957年英国对外贸易总的情况可以归纳为这样几个特点：一，发展的速度已越来越慢；二，英国的出口额在资本主义世界市场上所占的比重大大下降；三，英国对英镑区国家的输出，正被逐渐排挤，而这些国家对于英国经济来说，具有特殊重要的意义。
    1957年英国的输出如以数量来计算，比上一年增加了2％；如以价格来计算则增加了5.5％，但应该指出的是：出口价格在这一年中上涨了4.5％，因此实际上只增加了1％。在输入方面，尽管英国政府精打细算，而逆差却比去年扩大了。1956年逆差五亿六千八百万英镑，1957年却增加到六亿两千万英镑。而西德1956年比1955年贸易的输出量则增加了16％，1957年前十个月的总值比1956年同期增加了18％。
    随着对外贸易发展速度的缓慢、停滞，英国在整个资本主义世界出口贸易中所占比例正日益下降。1953年，英国所占百分比为21.2，1954年为20.4，1955年为19.7，1956年为19.0，1957上半年为18.3，1957下半年英国所占的贸易比例仍然继续在下降中。
    美国扶植的西德垄断资本重新登上国际竞争的舞台之后，使得英国对西欧市场上的输出，困难倍增。战后英国乘德国失败而造成的贸易繁荣一去不复返了。就在西欧市场上，1954年前半年同1956年前半年相较，英国对这个地区的出口只增加了15％；而西德却增加了42％；美国增加了36％。
    不仅如此。原来是英国传统市场的英镑区，美国和西德垄断资本也步步深入，逐渐取英国而代之。同时由于英联邦国家其它成员国工业的发展，英国同其它联邦成员国的关系，也远非昔比。
    去年澳大利亚放宽了八百余件货物的关税，并和其他国家发展了贸易关系。新西兰也放宽关税。这样，帝国优惠制在这些国家中已濒于解体。结果美国货物充斥在澳新市场上。
    由于美国和西德垄断资本的渗入，它们对英镑区的出
  口，日益增长，英国货物在这些国家人口比例中日益下降。拿1957年1月到6月同1955年同期相比较，英镑区国家工业品人口中，英国工业品所占份额下降了5％。如果以1957年1月到6月和1956年同期相比较，西德在英镑区国家工业品人口中增加了19％，美国增加了36％，英国的比重则继续下降。
    同样的现象，也发生在加拿大。在战前，美国向加拿大的输出是英国的三倍，现在是英国的九倍。加拿大的迪芬贝克政府打算把加拿大从美国输入的15％转到从英国输入，加拿大并且派了一个庞大的代表团来英国，这种努力到如今也失败了。主要是因为加拿大发现这两个国家的“输入和输出的需要不相符合”。
    工业生产下降　国内投资减少
    由于英国政府采取了紧缩信贷的政策，以及对外贸易的萎缩不振，使得一年来的英国工业生产基本陷于停顿状态。1957年的工业生产指数，据估计只提高了1％左右。但这主要是由于钢铁、化学、机械等工业增产的结果。在去年一年中，英国的钢铁生产增长了5％左右，化学工业增长了6.2％，机械工业增长了2％；而另一方面，有色金属、造船、电气、飞机等工业生产却大大下降了。这充分地揭示出资本主义生产的无政府状态和发展的极端不平衡。
    1957年的工业生产情况，说明英国经济的所谓“战后繁荣”已近尾声。值得注意的是，英国的钢铁消费量已达饱和点。工作母机的订货十五个月来一直在下降，按照目前订货的水平，只够十个月的生产，并且需求还在下降中。由于分期付款负债的增加（1957年达四亿英镑，每一个英国人平均约八英镑），耐用消费品的销售额日益下降。在这样一个情况面前，英国能不能以扩大军备竞赛来寻找“出路”？根据英国的具体情况来看，这一前景是暗淡的。目前英国的军费年达十五亿英镑。要使扩张军备对英国起进一步的刺激作用，必须大量增加军费，而这对于英国财政来说是难以负担的。应该指出，英国目前一些工业，已完全依靠政府军事订货来维持。但这决不是医治资本主义病症的“万灵良药”。例如，由于国防政策的改变，英国目前的飞机工业已面临危机。
    在工业生产趋于停滞的同时，英国企业的利润，除少数大公司外，总的说来是大大下降了。1957年的企业利润，比上一年下降了20％左右。这就必不可免的使投资的增长率大大减低。1955年投资比前一年增加了23％，1956年增加了20％，1957年原定增加7％，由于还没有公布总的数字，现在还不能断定究竟多少，但人们一般地是对此表示怀疑。因为，去年第一季度的投资增长率只有5％，第二季度只有3％。新建的工厂面积1957年前九个月与1956年同期比较，下降了10.5％。银行利率提高和“国有化”工业投资宣告冻结之后，更使这种局面恶化。第四季度建筑面积比第三季度减少了四百一十万平方英尺。
    在回顾1957年英国经济时，不能不提到资本主义世界经济活动衰退对英国所发生的影响。目前美国许多工业部门中的生产过剩，是1953年以来的第一次。所谓战后的“繁荣”，不论在美国或在其他国家（例如西德）都已接近结束。这对于英国的直接影响是：一，资本主义世界市场上的竞争比过去任何时候都剧烈。美国工业品以一切办法向外倾销，同时又减少输入。而美国市场对英国来说，占它出口总额的10％。二，资本主义世界——首先是美国——经济活动的衰退，使世界原料价格猛跌，平均下降了13％，某些原料品甚至跌价40％以上。这就大大削弱了原料出产国家的购买力。重要的是，英联邦国家大部分是原料出产国，在过去，英国依赖它赚取美元，而现在，已难以指望。1957年一年中，除英国以外的所有英镑国家，贸易逆差竟达一亿五千万英镑之巨！
    英镑动荡不定，对外贸易不振，工业生产停滞，国内投资下降，这就是一年来英国经济的基本情况。不难看出，1958年英国所面临的前景是多么黯淡。金融界对英镑最乐观的估计，是“只看六个月”，这就是说，英镑的跌风可能在下半年再次出现。在资本主义世界市场上，英国将遇到愈来愈残酷的竞争。生产可能继续停滞。至于投资，财政部已宣布“不可能增加”，因而使“金融时报”悲叹：“这是非常遗憾的事情，生产投资的下跌，意味着经济发展的衰落。”除非英国政府改变它的全盘政策，否则它的一切努力，都将付诸东流。
