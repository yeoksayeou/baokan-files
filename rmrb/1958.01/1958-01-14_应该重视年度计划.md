    Annual Plans Should Be Taken Seriously

    Conducting scientific research in a planned way is one of the characteristics of socialism. However, let's ask ourselves, what is our attitude towards planning?

    Take the annual plans of certain research groups in the Institute of Applied Physics, for example. There has been no improvement in the past five years. Some people regard drawing up plans as a burden, simply filling out forms and "handing in the paper" when preparing them. Therefore, the plans are very simple, "a flash of inspiration," and just a few lines are written casually. As for later, they just do whatever comes their way; some people even forget about the research plan completely after putting it in the safe. Some people make their plans so general and loose that they can easily "complete" or "overfulfill" the task by the end of the year. Some people emphasize objective reasons, using lack of experience, difficult material conditions, and the inherent characteristics of scientific research as excuses, turning the annual plan into a mere formality!

    The annual plan is an integral part of the long-term scientific plan, and it specifically embodies the content and progress of the plan. Now, one-sixth of the twelve years has already passed! If we don't catch up quickly, catching up with the world's advanced levels will only be empty talk for these disciplines. How will everyone report to the motherland and the people then? (Abstract)

### 应该重视年度计划

    应该重视年度计划
    有计划地进行科学研究是社会主义性质的特征之一。但是，扪心自问，我们对待计划的态度是怎样的呢？
    拿应用物理研究所某些研究组的年度计划来说，五年以来并没有什么改进。有人把订计划看成是负担，在制订时只是填表格，“交卷”算数。因此计划订得很简单，“灵机一动”，随便写上几行。至于以后，还是碰到哪里做到哪里；甚至有些人当研究计划放入保险柜以后，就把它忘之九霄云外了。也有人把计划订得既笼统又宽松，到年底自然就轻而易举地“完成”或“超额完成”了任务。有的人强调客观原因，以缺乏经验、物质条件有困难以及科学研究有其本身的特点等作为借口，把年度计划变成了形式上的点缀品！
    年度计划是科学远景规划的组成部分，它具体地体现了规划的内容和进度。如今十二年已经过去了六分之一！如果还不急起直追，对这些学科来说，要赶上世界先进水平只是纸上谈兵。到时候大家又怎么向祖国和人民汇报呢？（摘要）
