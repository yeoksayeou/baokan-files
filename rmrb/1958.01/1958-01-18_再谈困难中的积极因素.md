Talking Again About the Positive Factors in Difficulties
Editor

Yesterday, we already discussed that difficulties contain the factors for overcoming them. From the news report by Comrade Li Jiping about the Hongguang First Cooperative in Nanyuan Village achieving an average yield of over a thousand catties per mu, published in this newspaper today, we can see that it was precisely by facing the difficulties squarely and adopting a positive attitude to overcome them that the work of raising the socialist ideology of the masses and increasing the yield per unit area was greatly advanced.

Limited land and a large population are common difficulties on China's agricultural front. In places like Nanyuan Village, where each person has only a little more than five fen of land on average, this difficulty far exceeds the lack of arable land encountered in general areas. What are the positive factors contained in such a difficulty? It is precisely the "large population." A large population, a large labor force, is the most powerful force for overcoming difficulties. If we merely regard the large population as a "burden" and treat the difficulty with a "helpless" attitude, we will truly be like carrying a heavy burden, unable to move an inch. If we regard the large population as a driving force and treat the difficulty with a positive and enterprising spirit, we will be like gaining a fine horse, traveling a thousand miles a day.

In the face of the fact that there is little land and a large population, people have adopted different attitudes. We can see that there is not only a struggle between the positive and the negative, the advanced and the conservative, but also a struggle between socialism and capitalism. These two struggles are intertwined. Some people, because they do not see that limited land can produce unlimited increases, are enthusiastic about becoming small merchants; and some people, precisely because they are enthusiastic about becoming small merchants, cannot see that there is still great potential in agricultural production. Difficulties in natural conditions here have formed a difficulty on the ideological front. However, it was precisely in a series of struggles to overcome this difficulty that the Nanyuan Village Party Branch greatly improved the ideological level of the masses.

The comrades of the Nanyuan Village Party Branch and the Hongguang First Cooperative Management Committee, on the one hand, grasped socialist ideological education, and on the other hand, mobilized the masses to come up with ideas to increase production. As socialist consciousness improved, production enthusiasm also increased, and the creativity of the masses was brought into play. As a result, the fact that the same piece of land could be harvested three or four times a year appeared on many lands in Nanyuan Village. According to the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, the multiple cropping index north of the Yellow River and south of the Great Wall should be increased to about 120% by 1967. In 1957, the Hongguang First Cooperative had already increased the multiple cropping index of most of its land to over 270%. These facts have raised the socialist consciousness of the masses to a new height.

Using steel to strike hard rocks can not only smash them but also produce brilliant sparks; using strong will and resolute action to deal with difficulties can not only eliminate them but also produce greater achievements. The more it is hindered, the more it can increase strength; isn't it only by building high dams that rivers can generate enormous power?

    再谈困难中的积极因素
    编者
    昨天我们已经谈过，在困难中就包含着战胜困难的因素；从今天本报发表的李吉平同志写的南园村红光一社平均亩产千斤以上的通讯中，又可以看到，正是因为正视困难，并采取了积极克服困难的态度，就把提高群众的社会主义思想和提高单位面积产量的工作都大大地推进了一步。
    地少人多，这是我国农业战线上普遍存在的一个困难。像南园村这样，平均每人只有五分多地，这个困难大大超过了一般地区碰到的缺少耕地的困难。在这样的困难中包含着的积极因素是什么？正是“人多”。人多，劳动力多，这正是战胜困难的最强大的力量。如果仅仅把人多当作“包袱”，用“莫可奈何”的态度对待困难，那就真会像背起了千斤重的包袱一样，寸步难行。如果把人多当作动力，用积极进取的精神对待困难，那就会像得到了骏马一样，日行千里。
    在地少人多的事实面前，人们采取了不同的态度。我们可以看到，这里不仅有积极与消极、先进与保守的斗争，也有社会主义与资本主义的斗争。这两种斗争又是交织在一起的。一些人因为看不到有限的土地可以无限地增产，乃热中于做小商贩；又有些人由于热中于做小商贩，才看不清农业生产上还有很大的潜力。自然条件的困难，在这里又形成了思想战线上的一个困难。可是，南园村党支部正是在战胜这个困难的一系列斗争中，把群众的思想水平大大提高了。
    南园村党支部和红光一社管委会的同志们，一方面抓紧了社会主义思想教育，一方面发动群众出主意增加生产。社会主义觉悟提高了，生产积极性也就提高了，群众的创造性也就发挥出来了。于是，同一块土地上一年收获三次、四次的事实在南园村的许多土地上出现了。按照全国农业发展纲要修正草案，黄河以北、长城以南的复种指数到1967年要提高到120％左右。红光一社，在1957年就把大半土地的复种指数提高到了270％以上。这些事实，把群众的社会主义觉悟又提高到了新的高度。
    用钢铁猛击坚硬的石块，不但能敲碎它，还能迸出灿烂的火花；用坚强的意志和坚决的行动对付困难，不但能消灭它，还能产生出更大的成就。越是受到阻碍，越能增加力量；不正是筑起高坝来，河流才能产生出来巨大的电力吗？
