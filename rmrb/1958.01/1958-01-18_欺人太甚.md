    Treating People Too Harshly
    According to the "Manila Chronicle," the United States still insists on not handing over the title deed of Malacañang Palace, the Philippine presidential residence, to the Philippines.
    The area of Malacañang Palace is naturally a "tiny place," but it is the location of the presidential residence of independent Philippines. The United States wants to firmly hold the title deed of the presidential residence, simply to make the head of a country have no place to stand, and must live on "someone else's" land to manage his own country. This is truly treating people too harshly!

    欺人太甚
    据“马尼拉纪事报”说，直到今天，美国仍然坚持不肯把菲律宾总统官邸马拉坎南宫的地契交给菲律宾。
    马拉坎南宫这块地方，论面积自然是“弹丸之地”，但是它却是独立了的菲律宾的总统官邸所在。美国要把总统官邸的地契牢牢抓在手里，无非是要使一个国家的元首连块站脚的地方也没有，必须住在“别人”的土地上来管理自己的国家，这真是欺人太甚！
