    Vivid Velvet Animal Toys

    Handicraft artist Xu Baoying grew up in Hangzhou, famous for its silk production. She has a special fondness for the gorgeous and brilliant silks and velvets meticulously crafted by the working people of our country. For several years, she has been thinking: If the scraps of velvet, with their beautiful colors, could be made into various animal toys, wouldn't “making the best use of everything” not only contribute to the country's efforts in increasing production and practicing economy, but also allow her to pour in a share of strength? After painstaking research, she finally created more than forty kinds of artistic animal toys such as kittens, bears, monkeys, pandas, and piglets. Some of these products are sold in Shanghai, and they have also participated in overseas exhibitions.

    When the Soviet Circus troupe came to Shanghai to perform last year before the Spring Festival, Xu Baoying visited their wonderful performances and was deeply attracted by the charming form of the "animal actor" "Batap". Therefore, she studied the animal's expression and made an adorable "Batap", and paired it with two Chinese pandas to form a set, which she sent to the Soviet Circus troupe. The head of the troupe, Asanov, felt exceptionally close and fond of this wonderful gift, and specially wrote a letter to thank her.

    The velvet animals made by Xu Baoying not only grasp the different physical characteristics of various animals, but also deeply depict the characteristics of each animal. For example, a small black cat she made shows the kitten's innocence and loveliness, making people adore it. It is opening its round eyes, perhaps looking at a small butterfly flying past in front of it! Another example is a small bear that has obediently learned to stand upright, but such an action is still not very natural for the bear. The author carefully depicts its surprising and naive expression when standing upright.

    Initially, she was the only one making these toys. Later, as the business developed, under the care of the Party and the People's Government, a "Silk Animal Art Craft Production Group" was organized. Recently, they have also created some themed works with background settings.

    The socialist motherland can inspire everyone to give full play to their talents. Who would have looked up to these "little trinkets" in the old society!

    生动的丝绒动物玩具
    方英
    手工艺艺人许宝瑛，她生长在出产丝绸著名的杭州。她对我国劳动人民精心制作出来的华丽绚烂的丝绸、丝绒，有着特殊的好感。几年来她一直动脑筋：如果把一些丝绒的零料，用它的美丽的色泽，来制成各种形象的动物玩具，使“物尽其用”不是对祖国的增产节约更可以投注一份力量么？经过她苦心钻研，终于制成了小猫、小熊、猴子、熊猫、小猪等四十多种具有艺术性的动物玩具。这些产品部分的在上海销售，也曾参加过出国的展览。
    去年春节前苏联马戏团来上海表演的时候，许宝瑛参观了马戏团的精彩演出，被“兽演员”“巴达普”的娇憨形态所深深吸引；因此，她揣摩这种动物的神态，制成了一头可爱的“巴达普”，并配上了二只中国熊猫合成一组，送给苏联马戏团。团长阿萨诺夫对于这件精彩的礼物感到分外的亲切喜爱，并特地写信向她致谢。
    许宝瑛所制的丝绒动物，不仅能掌握各种动物的不同的形体上的特征，而且更能深入地刻画出各种动物的特性。如她所作的一只小黑猫，表现出小猫的天真稚气，逗人喜爱，它睁着两只圆圆的眼睛，也许是看着前面正飞过的一个小蝴蝶吧！又如那只小熊乖乖地已会直立了，但这样的动作对小熊来说还是不很习惯，作者把它那种直立时惊奇稚憨的神态细心地刻画出来了。
    作这些玩具，最初只是她个人，后来业务发展了，在党和人民政府的关怀下，已组织了“丝绸动物美术工艺生产小组”。最近还创制了部分配景的具有主题性的作品。
    社会主义的祖国可以鼓舞着每一个人尽量地发挥各人的才能，在旧社会谁瞧得起这些“小玩意”呢！
