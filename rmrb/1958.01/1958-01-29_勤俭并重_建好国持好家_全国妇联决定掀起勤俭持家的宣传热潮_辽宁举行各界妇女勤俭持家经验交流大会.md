Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The All-China Women's Federation held a meeting of directors of women's federations from provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in Beijing from January 20th to 27th. The main topic of this meeting was how to further mobilize women, together with the people of the whole country, to jointly promote a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production under the new situation. It was also decided to organize a propaganda upsurge for diligent and thrifty housekeeping from before the Spring Festival to the "March 8th" Women's Day period.

The meeting believed that women's federations at all levels must continue to mobilize the masses of women to participate in the nationwide rectification campaign, and on the basis of continuously improving their political and ideological awareness, to muster revolutionary vigor, actively and diligently implement the resolution of the Third National Women's Congress on "building the country diligently and thriftily, managing the home diligently and thriftily, and striving for socialist construction," and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of women in industrial and agricultural production and various construction tasks. In particular, it is necessary to mobilize and organize rural women to actively participate in the discussion of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and the formulation of plans for their respective regions. While arousing the enthusiasm of women, attention should be paid to the labor protection of women, to ensure the full and rational use of women's labor force, to encourage and help women learn technology, to exert women's labor efficiency for a long time, and to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1958.

The meeting believed that in implementing the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and managing the home diligently and thriftily, attention must be paid to publicizing the relationship between building the country diligently and thriftily and managing the home diligently and thriftily, explaining that building the country diligently and thriftily is a general national construction policy, and that the spirit of diligence and thrift should be implemented in all aspects of production, various tasks, and daily life, and that one should not leave the purpose of building the country diligently and thriftily and developing production to publicize diligent and thrifty housekeeping in isolation. Diligent and thrifty housekeeping is an important aspect of building the country diligently and thriftily, and the purpose is to build the country diligently and thriftily. Building the country diligently and thriftily is for the purpose of developing production and improving the material and cultural life of the people. In implementing this policy, attention must also be paid to the equal importance of diligence and thrift. Diligence can increase production, and thrift can reduce consumption and increase accumulation. Only by doing both at the same time can we both build the country well and manage the home well.

The meeting required that women's federations at all levels must learn to use the working method of the mass line when implementing the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and managing the home diligently and thriftily. Through big blooming, big contending, and big debating, putting forward ideas, raising questions, as well as cultivating typical examples, discussing typical examples, and positive education, and other methods of the masses educating themselves, the masses can consciously and willingly and happily implement this policy.

The meeting believed that women's federations at all levels have already made certain achievements in implementing the resolutions of the Third National Women's Congress since the congress. However, the development of work is still uneven. Therefore, the meeting decided that women's federations at all levels should organize a propaganda upsurge across the country from before the Spring Festival to "March 8th" Women's Day, so that the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and managing the home diligently and thriftily is known to every household.

The meeting also discussed the tasks of the All-China Women's Federation in 1958.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th: The Liaoning Provincial Women's Experience Exchange Conference on Diligent and Thrifty Housekeeping was held in Shenyang from the 18th to the 24th. This conference was held by the Liaoning Provincial Women's Federation in order to launch a high tide of diligent and thrifty housekeeping and support socialist construction throughout the province. Three hundred and thirty-five experts, activists, and women workers at all levels from all over the province and from all walks of life participated in this conference.

Thirty-three representatives introduced the experience of leading the masses in carrying out diligent and thrifty housekeeping by the families' committees at the city, county, and grassroots levels, as well as the specific experience of diligent and thrifty housekeeping by women from all walks of life. The deeds of He Hua, a family member of a senior intellectual in Dalian, who turned from being fond of ease and comfort to being an expert in diligent and thrifty housekeeping, were praised by the family members of senior intellectuals attending the conference. The experience of Wang Da Niang from Kaiyuan County in raising pigs with green fodder was welcomed by the women from the countryside.

Through discussions in large and small meetings, the representatives had a clear understanding of the significance and role of diligent and thrifty housekeeping in supporting socialist construction. During the meeting, women's work cadres from various special districts, cities, and counties all made concrete plans to carry out propaganda activities for diligent and thrifty housekeeping after returning.

    勤俭并重　建好国持好家
    全国妇联决定掀起勤俭持家的宣传热潮
    辽宁举行各界妇女勤俭持家经验交流大会
    新华社28日讯　全国妇女联合会20日到27日在北京召开各省、自治区、市妇联主任会议。这次会议主要讨论了如何在新的形势下进一步动员广大妇女同全国人民一起共同促进工农业生产大跃进的问题，并且决定在春节前到“三八”妇女节期间组织一个勤俭持家的宣传热潮。
    会议认为，各级妇联必须继续发动妇女群众参加全民整风运动，在不断提高政治思想觉悟的基础上，鼓足革命干劲，积极努力地贯彻执行全国第三次妇女代表大会关于“勤俭建国，勤俭持家，为建设社会主义而奋斗”的决议，充分发挥妇女群众在工、农业生产和各项建设工作中的积极性和创造性。特别要发动和组织农村妇女，积极参加全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）和本地区制订规划的讨论。在鼓起妇女干劲的同时，要注意妇女的劳动保护，作到充分而合理地使用妇女劳动力，鼓励和帮助妇女学习技术，长期持久地发挥妇女的劳动效率，争取1958年农业大丰收。
    会议认为，在贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭持家这一方针时，必须注意宣传勤俭建国和勤俭持家两者的关系，说明勤俭建国是一个总的建国方针，应当把勤俭的精神贯彻到生产、各项工作和日常生活的各个方面，不能离开勤俭建国和发展生产的目的，孤立地宣传勤俭持家。勤俭持家是勤俭建国的一个重要方面，目的就是为了勤俭建国。勤俭建国就是为了发展生产，改善人民的物质和文化生活。在贯彻这一方针时，还必须注意勤劳和节俭两者并重。勤可以增加生产，俭可以减少消费增加积累，只有同时做到这两点，才可以既建好国又持好家。
    会议要求各级妇联在贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭持家方针时，必须学会运用群众路线的工作方法，通过大鸣大放大辩论，摆思想，提问题，以及培养典型、讨论典型、正面教育等群众自己教育自己的方法，达到群众能自觉自愿、心情舒畅地执行这个方针。
    会议认为，各级妇联在全国第三次妇女代表大会以后，对贯彻大会决议已经作出了一定成绩。但是工作发展还不平衡。因此，会议决定各级妇联在春节前到“三八”妇女节期间，在全国范围内组织一个宣传热潮，作到使勤俭建国、勤俭持家方针家喻户晓。
    会议还讨论了全国妇联1958年的工作任务。
    据新华社沈阳26日电　辽宁省各界妇女勤俭持家经验交流大会18日到24日在沈阳市举行。这次大会是辽宁省妇女联合会为了在全省掀起一个勤俭持家、支援社会主义建设的高潮而举行的。来自全省各地、各阶层的三百三十五名勤俭持家能手、积极分子和各级妇女工作者参加了这个大会。
    有三十三名代表在会上介绍了各市县和基层家属委员会领导群众开展勤俭持家工作的经验，以及各界妇女勤俭持家的具体经验。旅大市高级知识分子家属何华由好逸恶劳变成勤俭持家能手的事迹，受到参加大会的高级知识分子家属的称赞。开原县王大娘用青饲料养猪的经验受到来自农村妇女们的欢迎。
    经过大会小会的讨论，代表们对勤俭持家支援社会主义建设的意义和作用有了明确的认识，各专区、市、县的妇女工作干部在会议期间，都订出了回去开展勤俭持家宣传活动的具体计划。
