    Reported by our reporter Zheng Qimin: As thousands of cadres are eagerly going to the countryside and mountains, Xie Xuegong, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, led a work group to inspect the areas where the department's cadres were transferred – the Xingtai Special District of Hebei Province. During the inspection, they deeply understood the labor and ideological situation of the transferred cadres and promptly solved the problems existing among them. Recently, the reporter visited Comrade Xie Xuegong, who had just returned from Xingtai. He described in detail the enthusiastic welcome of the local farmers to the transferred cadres, the active participation of the transferred cadres in labor, and the impact they had in the countryside.

    Comrade Xie Xuegong said that the Hebei Provincial Party Committee at all levels attached great importance to the work of receiving transferred cadres from central government departments. The prefectural committee, county committee, and even the township party committee and village branch were very serious about arranging the work of the transferred cadres. The scene of local cadres and farmers warmly welcoming the transferred cadres was deeply moving. The cadres who went to Neiqiu County arrived at more than two o'clock in the morning. At that time, the north wind was blowing, and the weather was very cold, but there were many county and township cadres and members of nearby agricultural cooperatives standing at Neiqiu Railway Station to welcome them. When the cadres transferred to Longyao County got off the train at Fengcun Station and headed towards the county seat, the masses and farmers who were working along the way waved, applauded, and shouted, "Welcome to the people sent by Chairman Mao to support us." Some county heads and county party secretaries personally came out of the city to greet them, carrying their luggage and backpacks for them. After arriving in the county, the county head and county party secretary introduced the local customs, the long-term plan for agricultural production, and the current production tasks to the transferred cadres. When the cadres arrived in the townships and agricultural cooperatives, the farmers had already prepared housing for them. Due to the importance attached by the local party committee and government, and the enthusiastic welcome and help from township and cooperative cadres and farmers, many comrades were moved to tears. Some comrades said: "This is the first lesson for us." It can be seen that the close cooperation between the political and ideological work of the transferred cadres and the local work is very important.

    When talking about the cadres' participation in labor, Comrade Xie Xuegong said: 70% of the cadres sent down by the Ministry of Foreign Trade for labor training this time are young intellectuals. The vast majority of them had never carried a load on their shoulders or a basket in their hands. This time, in the counties, it was seen that the vast majority of comrades had high morale, were in good spirits, and quickly participated in labor, showing good performance. When Comrade Wang Yushan arrived at Xiying Village Agricultural Cooperative in Xingtai County, he saw that the cooperative was digging a well. After repeated requests, the captain agreed to let him go down the well for a while. However, after he went down, he worked straight until dark before coming up. He earned eleven work points on the first day. Many farmers said: "Yushan is remarkable. He went down the well on the first day he came to the cooperative. The young man is great!" After Cai Longgen arrived in the village, he worked with the farmers and earned seven or eight work points every day. Ma Zizhi earned twenty-six work points after working in the countryside for three days. Although he was so tired that his back ached and blisters appeared on his hands, his enthusiasm for labor was still very high. Comrade Luo Zhenyuan, who rarely participated in physical labor in the past and had a strong "Miss" demeanor in the office, got up at four o'clock in the morning on the second day of her arrival at Yaobei Village Cooperative in Yaocheng Township, and together with the production team leader, each carried a pair of urine buckets to Longyao No. 1 Middle School to collect urine to fertilize the wheat. Indeed, the high tide of socialist construction in the countryside is difficult for comrades to truly feel in the office and in books. Only when they are in it can they feel it deeply and understand it thoroughly, and it is most encouraging to their enthusiasm for labor.

    These transferred cadres not only participated in labor with the farmers, but also took the initiative to help the farmers sweep the yards and fetch water in their spare time. The female comrades helped the villagers cook, wash dishes, take care of children, and do needlework. Tan Yinfu had a lot of accounting knowledge. In his spare time, he helped the accountant of the agricultural cooperative develop a simple and easy-to-use accounting system. This matter attracted the attention of the leaders of Longyao County. Secretary Zhang of the County Party Committee said that if it could be successfully implemented on a trial basis, he would prepare to promote it throughout the county. Many comrades have also developed good relationships with village and cooperative cadres and farmers. For example, Cao Kangbo was able to call out the names of more than 20 village and cooperative cadres and villagers three days after arriving in the village, and was very affectionate with the villagers, calling each other brothers and sisters.

    Comrade Xie Xuegong said that the more than 600 cadres of the Ministry of Foreign Trade have had a relatively large impact on the Xingtai Special District since they went down to participate in labor. Many township and cooperative cadres and farmers have said: "The Party and the government really value agriculture, and they have sent so many educated cadres to support us!" Some township and cooperative cadres regard the participation of government cadres in rural production as a driving force to encourage and promote farmers to actively participate in labor. For example, Guluying Village in Lincheng is building a reservoir. Because the transferred cadres participated in this labor, the township cadres used this to call on everyone, saying, "Chairman Mao has sent people to help us, let's work harder!" As a result, the farmers' enthusiasm for labor soared, resulting in a doubling of the construction speed of the reservoir. In these counties, some intellectuals and middle school students were originally uneasy about working in the countryside, but now that they have seen many government cadres coming down to work, their thinking has also changed. For example, the students of Longyao No. 1 Middle School were very moved when they saw many young intellectuals and section-level cadres working in the fields with the farmers, and when they saw female students who had just graduated from university carrying urine buckets to their school every day to collect urine. Some students said: "People who have graduated from university and studied abroad are doing this, what else can we say." Some students said: "This is equivalent to giving me three years of political lessons." Some teachers in Longyao Middle School, who had been uneasy about their work in the past, attended the meeting to welcome the transferred cadres, and after seeing the team of intellectuals participating in labor, they told the leaders: "I will never be emotional again in the future."

    When Comrade Xie Xuegong talked about the issues that should be paid attention to in the future, he said that according to the inspection, the cadres' enthusiasm for labor is very high, which is very good and should be maintained. However, every comrade should consciously prevent the outbreak of the "hot and cold disease" of intellectuals, and should have the determination and tenacity to overcome all difficulties, so as to truly achieve the purpose of labor training. Secondly, having only enthusiasm for labor is not enough. We must also pay attention to putting down the airs of cadres and the airs of intellectuals in our thinking, words, deeds, and daily life, and cultivate the spirit of humbly learning, the style of closely linking with the masses, and the habit of diligence and thrift.

### 外贸部工作组视察下放干部的情况  锻炼了干部  帮助了农村

    外贸部工作组视察下放干部的情况
    锻炼了干部  帮助了农村
    本报讯　记者郑启民报道：当着成千上万的干部正在踊跃下乡上山的时候，对外贸易部副部长解学恭同志率领一个工作组到该部下放干部的地区——河北邢台专区进行了视察。在视察中，深入了解了下放干部的劳动和思想情况，及时解决了下放干部中存在的问题。最近，记者访问了才从邢台归来的解学恭同志，他详细地叙述了当地农民热烈欢迎下放干部的情况，下放干部积极参加劳动的情况以及在农村中所产生的影响等问题。
    解学恭同志说，河北省各级党委对接受中央机关下放干部的工作非常重视，地委、县委、直到乡党委和村支部对安排下放干部的工作都很认真。当地干部和农民热烈欢迎下放干部的情景，使人深为感动。到内丘县去的干部是夜里两点多钟到达的。当时刮着北风，天气很冷，但是内丘火车站上却站着很多前来欢迎的县、乡干部，和附近农业社的社员。下放隆尧县的干部在冯村车站下车向县城进发时，沿途群众和正在干活的农民，都向干部招手，鼓掌，高喊“欢迎毛主席派来支援我们的人”。有些县的县长、县委书记还亲自出城迎接，替他们搬行李、背背包。到县以后，县长、县委书记给下放干部介绍县里的风俗习惯，农业生产的远景规划和当前生产任务等。干部到乡和农业社的时候，农民也早给准备了住房。由于地方党委和政府的重视，乡、社干部和农民对下放干部的这种热情欢迎和帮助，许多同志被感动得掉下了眼泪，有同志说：“这是给我们上的第一课”。由此可以看出，下放干部的政治思想工作与地方上的工作的密切配合是非常重要的。
    当谈到干部参加劳动的情况时，解学恭同志说：外贸部这次下放劳动锻炼的干部，有70％是青年知识分子，绝大多数过去是肩没有挑过担，手没有提过篮的人。这次在各县看到：绝大多数同志情绪高涨，精神愉快，并且很快地参加了劳动，表现很好。王玉山同志到达邢台县西营村农业社的时候，看到社里正在打井，他经过再三请求，队长答应他下井看一会。可是，他下去后，直干到天黑才上来。第一天就评了十一个工分，很多农民说：
  “玉山可了不起，来社的头一天就下井，小伙子真棒！”蔡龙根到村以后，同农民一起干活，每天挣七、八个工分。马自知下乡劳动了三天，就挣了二十六个工分，他累得虽然腰酸背痛、手上起了血泡，但是劳动热情仍然很高。过去很少参加体力劳动、在机关时“闺秀”气较浓的罗贞媛同志，在到尧城乡尧北里社的第二天早晨四点多钟就起床，同生产队长一起，每人挑一副尿桶，到隆尧第一中学去挑尿浇麦了。的确，农村社会主义建设的高潮，同志们在机关里，在书本上是很难真切地感觉到的，只有当他们身临其境时才能感受得深、了解得透，对他们劳动热情的鼓舞也最大。
    这些下放干部不仅同农民一起参加劳动，而且一有空闲，还主动帮助农民扫院子、打水。女同志帮助老乡们做饭、洗碗、照看孩子，做针线活。谭荫孚的会计知识较多，他在工余时间帮助农业社的会计制定一套简单易行的会计制度。这件事引起了隆尧县领导上的重视，县委张书记表示如能试行成功，准备在全县推广。有许多同志与村社干部和农民的关系也搞得很好。如曹康伯到村三天后，能叫出二十多个村、社干部和老乡们的名字，和老乡们称兄道弟，非常亲热。
    解学恭同志说，外贸部的六百多干部下去参加劳动以后，对邢台专区的影响也是比较大的。许多乡、社干部和农民都反映：“党和政府真重视农业，派这样多有文化的干部来支援我们！”有的乡、社干部把机关干部下乡生产作为鼓舞和推动农民积极参加劳动的动力。如临城古鲁营村正在兴修水库，由于下放干部参加了这项劳动，乡干部就以此号召大家说，“毛主席派人来帮忙了，咱们加油干啊！”于是农民劳动热情顿时高涨，结果使水库的修建速度提高了一倍。在这几个县里有些知识分子和中学生，原来不安心农村工作，现在看到有许多机关干部下来劳动了，思想也起了变化。如隆尧第一中学的学生看到许多青年知识分子、科长级干部在田地里同农民一起劳动，看到刚从大学毕业的女学生天天挑着尿桶到他们学校挑尿，心里非常感动。有的学生说：“人家大学生、外国留学的都这样，我们还有啥说的”。有的学生说：“这一下子，顶给我上三年政治课”。隆尧中学有些教员，过去工作一直不安心，他们参加了欢迎下放干部的大会，亲眼看到知识分子参加劳动的队伍以后就向领导上表示：“今后再不闹情绪了。”
    解学恭同志谈到今后应该注意的问题时说，根据视察情况看，干部的劳动热情是很高的，这很好，应当继续保持。但是每个同志都要自觉的防止知识分子冷热病的发作，应当具有克服一切困难的决心和顽强性，真正达到劳动锻炼的目的。其次，光有劳动热情还不够，还要从思想、言语行动和日常生活上注意放下干部架子，放下知识分子架子，养成虚心学习的精神、密切联系群众的作风和勤劳节俭的习惯。
