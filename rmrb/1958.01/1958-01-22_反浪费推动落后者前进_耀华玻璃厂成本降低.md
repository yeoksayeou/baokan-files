Anti-Waste Drives Laggards Forward
Yaohua Glass Factory Reduces Costs

(Our Dispatch) The employees of the Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory conducted special "blooming and contending" discussions focusing on the issue of opposing waste and reducing costs, plugging many loopholes of waste. Now, according to the factory's Party committee and administrative cadres, it is estimated that the total cost of the factory in 1958 will be reduced by 10% compared to 1957, saving the country more than 1.4 million yuan.

In 1957, the cost of each case of glass produced by this factory was about 10 to 20 cents higher than that of the two glass factories in Shenyang and Dalian. Why was the cost of this factory higher than that of other factories? In this special "blooming and contending" discussion, employees revealed many wasteful phenomena, pointing out that this was the reason for the high cost. For example, workers in the raw material workshop posted big-character posters revealing that due to blind procurement, there were enough double hammer mill seat spare parts to last for 150 years, tying up more than 10,000 yuan in capital. The supply and marketing section had 538 accidents such as wrong loading and wrong transportation in the past year alone, causing a loss of 162,600 yuan. For example, once a trainload of glass sold to Tanggu was sent to Shanghai and then transported from Shanghai to Tanggu. Sometimes, glass was sold without records or collecting payment. For example, when 100 cases of glass were sold to the municipal department store, the supply and marketing section firmly refused to accept the payment when they sent it. Later, the department store couldn't account for the payment, so they sued in the Municipal People's Court, and the problem was finally resolved. According to the currently revealed materials, this factory wasted and tied up more than 560,000 yuan of state funds in 1957.

Through this special "blooming and contending" discussion, the factory's leaders found the reasons for the high cost, mobilized the masses to find many ways to plug various loopholes. It is estimated that the cost per case this year will be reduced to 6.04 yuan, which is lower than the cost of the two glass factories in Shenyang and Dalian in the third quarter of last year.

    反浪费推动落后者前进
    耀华玻璃厂成本降低
    本报讯　秦皇岛市耀华玻璃厂职工围绕反对浪费、降低成本问题进行了专题鸣放，堵住了许多浪费的漏洞。现在据这个厂的党委和行政干部预计，1958年全厂总成本将比1957年降低10％，为国家节约一百四十多万元。
    这个厂1957年每箱玻璃的成本，比沈阳、大连的两个玻璃厂高出约一角到二角。为什么这个厂的成本比其它厂高呢？职工们在这次专题鸣放中揭发出了许多浪费现象，指出这是成本高的原因。如原料车间工人贴大字报揭发，由于盲目采购，双锤碾座备件够用一百五十年，积压资金一万多元。供销科仅去年一年就发生装错、运错等事故五百三十八次，造成了十六万二千六百元的损失。如有一次把卖给塘沽的一个车皮的玻璃发到了上海，又从上海运到塘沽。有时候卖玻璃不记账，也不去要钱。如卖给市百货公司一百箱玻璃，人家送来货款时供销科坚决不收，后来百货公司没法下账，到市人民法院告了一状，才算解决了这个问题。据目前揭发出来的材料，这厂在1957年就浪费和积压了国家资金五十六万多元。
    经过这次专题鸣放，这个厂的领导人员找到了成本高的原因，发动群众找出许多办法，堵塞了各种漏洞。预计今年每箱成本将降低到六点零四元，比沈阳、大连两个玻璃厂去年第三季度的成本低。（石林）
