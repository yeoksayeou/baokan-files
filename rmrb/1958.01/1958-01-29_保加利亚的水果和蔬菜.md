	Bulgarian Fruits and Vegetables

	Bulgaria is rich in fruits and vegetables. It has 1,102,000 decares of orchards, 1,492,000 decares of vineyards, and 563,000 decares of land planted with vegetables.

	Bulgarian fruits and vegetables are known for their delicious taste and nutritional value, and they sell well on the international market. The German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Soviet Union, West Germany, Britain, Austria, Scandinavia, and the Near East are all its customers.

	In Bulgaria, September is the month when the most fruits and vegetables are produced. During this month, farmers are busy from morning till night. Along the country roads, you can see a continuous stream of large trucks loaded with fruits and vegetables.

	Bulgaria's fruit harvest in 1957 was approximately 20,000 tons more than in 1956. Vegetable production also increased. Calculated per capita, Bulgaria now has 200 kilograms of vegetables per person per year, exceeding some European countries with high vegetable production.

	The increase in fruit and vegetable production has also increased the export value. The most exported item is tomatoes. Before the war, Bulgaria exported about 2,000 tons of fresh tomatoes annually, while in 1957, the export volume reached 50,000 tons.

	Bulgarian peppers are highly valued on the international market. The "Kapiya" variety of peppers contains 170 to 200 milligrams of Vitamin C, which is twice as much as that of lemons and oranges. Shops in Moscow, Berlin, London, and Warsaw often use Bulgaria's bright red "Kapiya" peppers to decorate their windows.

	Even before the war, Bulgarian grapes were popular in the international market. Today, Bulgaria remains one of the world's largest exporters of grapes. (Liu)

    保加利亚的水果和蔬菜
    保加利亚盛产水果和蔬菜。它有一百一十万零二千狄卡尔的水果园，一百四十九万二千狄卡尔的葡萄园，有五十六万三千狄卡尔的土地栽种了蔬菜。
    保加利亚的水果和蔬菜以味美和富于营养而著称，在国际市场上销路很广。民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、苏联、西德、英国、奥地利、斯堪的那维亚半岛和近东各国都是它的顾客。
    在保加利亚，每年9月是出产水果和蔬菜最多的一个月。在这个月里，农民们从早到晚都忙个不停。沿着乡间的公路，你可以看到川流不息的满载水果和蔬菜的大卡车。
    保加利亚1957年水果收获量比1956年大约多两万吨。蔬菜的产量也增加了。按人口计算，现在保加利亚每人每年有两百公斤蔬菜，超过了某些蔬菜产量多的欧洲国家。
    水果和蔬菜生产的提高使出口额也增加了。出口最多的是番茄。战前，保加利亚每年输出约两千吨鲜番茄，而1957年的输出额已达到五万吨。
    保加利亚的辣椒在国际市场上得到很高的评价。“卡比娅”种辣椒含有一百七十至二百毫克的维他命C，也就是说，比柠檬和橘子的含量多两倍。莫斯科、柏林、伦敦、华沙的商店，常常用保加利亚的鲜红的“卡比娅”来点缀橱窗。
    远在战前，保加利亚的葡萄在国际市场上就受到欢迎。现在，保加利亚仍然是世界上输出葡萄最多的国家之一。　（刘）
