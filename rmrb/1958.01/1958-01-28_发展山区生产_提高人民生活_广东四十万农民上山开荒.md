    Develop Mountainous Area Production and Improve People's Livelihood
    400,000 Guangdong Farmers Go to the Mountains to Reclaim Wasteland
    (Reported by our newspaper) Guangdong Province will organize 20,000 production teams, totaling 400,000 laborers, to go to the mountains and hills after the Spring Festival to develop mountainous areas. This was decided at a symposium held by the Rural Work Department of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee from January 7th to 11th.
    The meeting pointed out that mountainous and hilly areas, which account for about two-thirds of the province's total area, have good natural conditions and abundant resources, with great production potential. Developing these areas is an important direction for developing agricultural production in Guangdong. However, there is a general shortage of labor in the mountainous areas. The most important way to solve this problem is to organize surplus labor from the plains to go to the mountains and hills, develop and prosper the mountainous economy, and improve the material and cultural living standards of people in the plains and mountainous areas. The meeting pointed out that the development of mountainous areas mainly relies on agricultural cooperatives sending long-term, fixed production teams stationed in the mountains (hills), and specialized production teams that go out early and return late (for short distances).
    Regarding the production policy, the meeting pointed out that the Provincial Party Committee had made a clear stipulation on this at the mountainous area work conference in July last year, which is: "Based on grain, adapt to local conditions, comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries production, ensure increased grain production, increase income, prosper the mountainous economy, and continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of the people in the mountainous areas." When the production teams going to the mountains specifically implement the above-mentioned production policy, they must pay attention to increasing grain production and develop diverse economies in accordance with local conditions, attaching importance to the principle of using short-term gains to support long-term development, and combining short-term and long-term gains.
    Regarding business management issues, the meeting emphasized the need to conscientiously implement the principle of diligence and thrift in running the cooperatives, achieving less investment, quick results, and high returns. Basic construction should use local materials and be as simple as possible. In production management, the "three guarantees" (or "two guarantees") must be implemented, and piece-rate wages must be implemented. In terms of labor organization, it is necessary to adopt the form of long-term, fixed specialized teams and groups dispatched by agricultural cooperatives, which is conducive to implementing the responsibility system and beneficial to production. It is also necessary to promote the method of combining long-term, fixed production teams with the temporary organization of the masses for concentrated efforts (such as spring afforestation). In terms of unified operation and hierarchical management, the powers of the production teams going to the mountains can be appropriately expanded, allowing them to engage in some small public economy of the team, and encouraging them to grow vegetables, oil crops, and engage in small amounts of sideline businesses, etc., for the members to improve their lives, but they must not engage in commercial trading.
    Regarding the organization of teams, the meeting emphasized that the Party and Youth League organizations must be at the core, relying on the hard-working poor and lower-middle peasants. It is necessary to assign capable team leaders (preferably concurrently serving as the deputy director of the cooperative), which is of decisive significance.
    The meeting also strongly emphasized doing a good job in regular political and ideological work and timely solving various practical difficulties of the members going to the mountains, such as food subsidies, oil, vegetables, bedding, vacation systems, etc.
    The meeting finally requested that each special zone and county make all ideological, organizational, and material preparations for going to the mountains before the Spring Festival, and survey the locations and make plans. Immediately organize actions after the Spring Festival.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 27th. A wave of enthusiasm for developing mountainous areas in Guangdong Province has formed in many agricultural cooperatives throughout the province. In Yangchun, Maoming, Xinyi and other counties in the Zhanjiang Special Zone, leading cadres at the county, township, and cooperative levels have led members up the mountains to establish 192 cooperative-run forest farms, including diversified operations. Dai Liangbi, Secretary of the Yangchun County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, personally led cadres and members to reclaim wasteland on the mountains; many cadres and members have built houses on these mountains, taking the newly opened forest farms as their homes. The county's Forestry Bureau and the Party Committee offices of some mountainous townships have also moved to the mountains, establishing leadership organizations in the desolate mountains and wildernesses, setting up telephone lines, and directly commanding the reclamation work. The grassroots Party committee secretaries of all seventeen mountainous townships in the county brought their tools and utensils to live on the mountains, taking the lead in opening up wasteland.
    After checking and criticizing the past bias of neglecting deep mountainous and hilly areas in afforestation and the development of mountainous resources, the Gao Yao Special Zone decided that this year, in addition to building 71 state-owned forest farms, it will also successively organize 2,000 land reclamation teams with a total of 160,000 people to go to the mountains after the Spring Festival to cultivate the barren mountains and wastelands far and near. This year, forest farms will be established in the Dakeng Mountain in Huaiji County, the Yunwu Great Mountain in Yunfu County, and the barren mountains in Yunan County, which were previously rarely visited, to plant timber forests, fruit trees, and develop grain, animal husbandry, and sideline production.
    After carefully calculating the accounts, the cadres and members of agricultural cooperatives in various places have been further inspired with revolutionary enthusiasm. Many agricultural cooperative members in Yangchun County were initially afraid of the hardship of going to the mountains and the fear of sowing without reaping. Later, they launched a large-scale debate education, calculated the three accounts of labor output, member income, and the harm of not afforesting. After the members saw the long-term and immediate benefits, more than 4,000 people immediately joined the forestry production team to settle down on the mountains. The county has a maximum of 40,000 members going up the mountain to reclaim wasteland every day, and the county's plan to reclaim 200,000 mu of wasteland this year will be completed soon. After calculating the benefit accounts, many agricultural cooperatives in Chao'an County put forward the heroic words "We must regard the barren mountains as battlefields, and hoes as swords and guns; we will never go down the mountain until the barren mountains are transformed into orchards." One hundred and five production teams have already gone to the mountains to cultivate.
    The 20,000 specialized production teams currently organized throughout the province will not only reclaim wasteland for afforestation and carry out diversified operations, but also interplant miscellaneous grains and cultivate fields for rice planting in the forest land.

    发展山区生产　提高人民生活
    广东四十万农民上山开荒
    本报讯　广东省将在春节后组织二万个生产队共四十万个劳动力上山上丘陵，开发山区，这是1月7日至11日广东省委农村工作部召开的座谈会决定的。
    会议指出，约占全省总面积三分之二的山区和丘陵区，自然条件良好，资源丰富，生产潜力很大，开发这些地区，是发展广东农业生产的重要方向。但是，山区的劳动力普遍不足。解决这个问题最重要的一项办法是组织平原区的剩余劳动力上山上丘陵，开发与繁荣山区经济，改善与提高平原区与山区人民的物质和文化生活水平。会议指出，开发山区主要依靠农业社派出长期的、固定的驻山（丘陵）生产队，和早出晚归的专业生产队（近距离的）。
    关于生产方针问题，会议指出，去年7月山区工作会议上，省委对此已作明确规定，就是：“以粮食为基础，因地制宜，全面发展农、林、牧、副业生产，保证增产粮食，增加收入，繁荣山区经济，不断提高山区人民的物质和文化生活水平”。上山的生产队，在具体贯彻执行上述生产方针时，必须注意增产粮食，并因地制宜发展多种经济，重视以短养长，长短结合的原则。
    关于经营管理问题，会议强调认真贯彻勤俭办社原则，做到投资少、收效快、收益大。基本建设应该就地取材，因陋就简。在生产管理上，必须实行三包（或二包），实行按件计酬。在劳动组织上，必须采用由农业社派出长期、固定的专业队、专业组的形式，才易于贯彻责任制，有利生产。并且要推广长期、固定生产队与临时组织广大群众突击相结合（如春季造林）的办法。在统一经营、分级管理上，可以适当扩大上山生产队的权力，准许他们搞一些队的小公共经济，并鼓励他们种菜、种油料作物以及经营少量副业等，作为队员改善生活之用，但不得作商业买卖。
    关于组织队伍方面，会议强调必须以党、团组织为核心，以刻苦耐劳的贫农、下中农为依靠力量。必须配能干的队长（最好由社的副主任兼），这是有决定意义的。
    会议还十分强调做好经常性的政治思想工作和及时解决上山社员的各种实际困难问题，如粮食津贴、吃油、吃菜、被帐、休假制度等等。
    会议最后要求各专区、县于春节前做好上山的一切思想准备、组织准备和物质准备，并且查勘好地点，做好计划。春节后立即组织行动。
    据新华社广州27日电　广东省开发山区的热潮，已在全省许多农业社中形成。湛江专区的阳春、茂名、信宜等县，县、乡、社各级党委领导干部已经带领社员上山，建立起了一百九十二个包括多种经营的社办林场。中共阳春县县委书记戴良弼亲自率领干部、社员上山垦荒；许多干部、社员都在这些山岭上建起房舍，以新辟的林场为家。这个县的林业局和部分山区乡的党委办公室也已搬上山去，在荒山野岭建立起领导机构，架起电话线，直接指挥垦荒工作。全县十七个山区乡的基层党委书记都带了工具用具到山上住下来，带头开辟荒山。
    高要专区检查、批判了过去在造林和开发山区资源中忽视深远山区、丘陵地区的偏向以后，决定今年除了增建七十一个国营林场以外，还要陆续组织共十六万人的二千个垦荒队，在春节后上山去把远近荒山荒地垦殖起来。这个专区过去人迹罕到的怀集县大坑山、云浮县云雾大山及郁南等县荒山上，今年都要建立林场，种上用材林、果树，和发展粮食、畜牧、副业生产。
    经过算细账以后，各地农业社干部和社员更加激发起了革命干劲。阳春县许多农业社社员起初存在着怕上山艰苦、怕有种无收。后来展开大辩论教育，算了劳动力出路、社员收入和不造林的危害这三笔账，社员看清了长远利益和眼前利益后，立即有四千多人参加了林业生产队到山上安家落户。这个县每天上山垦荒的社员最多达到四万人，全县今年开垦二十万亩荒山的计划最近就能完成。潮安县许多农业社经过算利益账后，社员们就提出了“要把荒山当战场，锄头当刀枪；不把荒山变果园，誓不下山”的豪语，有一百零五个生产队已经上山垦殖。
    全省现在组织的两万个专业生产队，将一面垦荒造林和开展多种经营，一面又在林地上间种杂粮和垦田种稻。
