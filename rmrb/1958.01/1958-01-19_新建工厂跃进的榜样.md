    A model for the Great Leap Forward in new factories:
    The variety of new products produced and trial-manufactured by Anshan Iron and Steel's seamless steel tube plant is about three times more than the original design; the plant's planned output for 1958 exceeds the design capacity by two-thirds; during the second five-year plan, they will increase output to the equivalent of two seamless steel tube plants.
    (Our report) This reporter Chen Ji and Jin Yukun report: Five years have passed since October 27, 1953, at 2:30 p.m., when the first seamless steel tube shot out of the piercing machine like a dragon of fire. In these five years, Anshan Iron and Steel Company's seamless steel tube plant, like many newly built factories, encountered difficulties in adapting varieties to needs and fully utilizing equipment potential. However, the plant's employees, like employees of many new factories across the country, continuously overcame the difficulties they faced, resulting in a leap in production. As early as the year before last, the plant's output exceeded the originally designed production level; last year's output was already one-third higher than the designed level; this year's planned output will be two-thirds higher than the designed output. During the second five-year plan, its annual output will increase by one time compared to the designed annual output; that is to say, one seamless steel tube plant becomes two seamless steel tube plants. This is a great leap forward.
    The Predicament of "Not Having Enough to Eat"
    Initially, people thought: In a large country like ours, with construction everywhere, producing a large number of seamless steel tubes would not be a concern. However, the reality was not so. After the seamless steel tube plant went into production, it unexpectedly fell into the predicament of "not having enough to eat." In the second year after starting operations—1954—it could have produced 40,000 tons of seamless steel tubes according to its production capacity; however, orders were only for slightly more than 19,000 tons, resulting in the need to reduce the production plan to 23,000 tons. In 1955, the plan was also reduced due to insufficient orders. Due to insufficient production tasks, only two shifts could be worked each day, with often three or four hundred people without work, and some equipment was also idle. The workers had many opinions. Even more seriously, even with such a low output, many steel tubes still could not be sold and needed to be exported.
    This situation occurred not because the product varieties were wrongly specified during the design phase. With the development of the country's construction endeavors, these varieties would be needed in large quantities. However, because China's first five-year plan had only just begun at that time, there were not many large-scale construction projects, and the manufacturing of large-scale equipment was less common, the larger seamless steel tubes specified in the original design were temporarily not needed. What was urgently needed at the time were the smaller, multi-variety seamless steel tubes that the original design did not plan to produce. For example, the small tubes used for locomotive maintenance required at least 5,000 tons per year nationwide; drill pipes used for geological exploration also required more than 4,000 tons per year. This created an uncoordinated situation: on the one hand, the factory "didn't have enough to eat" and its production capacity could not be fully utilized; on the other hand, the majority of seamless steel tubes needed nationwide had to rely on imports.
    In this situation where the varieties needed by the country and the varieties produced by the factory were in contradiction, what kind of approach should be adopted for production? Should new varieties be actively added to adapt to the needs of the country? Or should production be rigidly carried out according to the varieties specified in the original design? According to the original design, the product varieties of the seamless steel tube plant were relatively simple, with only more than twenty types of steel tubes with outer diameters of 40-140 millimeters. This production method is beneficial for mass flow production and stable product quality under the conditions that there are more seamless steel tube plants and a reasonable division of labor can be carried out in terms of varieties. However, currently, China only has one seamless steel tube plant, and the varieties urgently needed by the country should be supplied by it as much as possible; at the same time, China does not yet have cold-drawn steel tube plants, and some small steel tubes that should have been produced by cold drawing also need to be produced by the seamless steel tube plant. Whether it is to meet the needs of the country or to ensure the normal production of the factory, the path of simply producing according to the original design varieties is impassable.
        Adding New Varieties
    The seamless steel tube plant adopted a proactive approach, striving to expand and add new steel tube varieties. In recent years, they have increased from the original design of more than twenty varieties to more than forty varieties, and at the same time, they have trial-manufactured more than thirty types of alloy steel tubes that were not in the original design. In addition, they also produced some steel tubes with larger specifications than the original design, such as large steel tubes with dozens of atmospheres of pressure used by the petroleum industry for sending water in desert areas and columns used by construction engineering departments to replace angle iron. The output of newly added varieties accounts for about one-third of the plant's total output.
    Of course, it is not an easy task to engage in the production of so many new varieties immediately after the seamless steel tube plant was just built. The specifications of new varieties are complex and varied, and the products are relatively scattered, making production arrangements very inconvenient. Many new varieties also require hot rolling to replace cold rolling, which is also technically difficult to master. The employees of the seamless steel tube plant, with an attitude of not being afraid of trouble, actively studied new technologies and strived to trial-manufacture more new varieties. Even for alloy steel tubes with a small quantity of four or five, they actively produced them. Jilin Chemical Zone installed a state-of-the-art equipment—a tubular furnace—which required a type of alloy steel tube. This steel tube was still being trial-manufactured in the Soviet Union and could not be supplied; later, after research by Soviet experts, the seamless steel tube plant was asked to trial-roll it. After rolling it many times, it was finally successfully rolled, helping Jilin Chemical Zone to install the tubular furnace in a timely manner. Increasing the production of new varieties not only met the urgent needs of the country in many aspects, trained all the plant's employees, and enabled them to quickly improve their technical level, but also laid a good foundation for rapidly improving production capacity and producing technically more complex varieties in the future.
      Expanding Product Sales Channels
    While increasing new varieties, the plant also actively solicited sources of goods in various places to expand product sales channels. After relevant units in various places understood the plant's varieties, quality, and other information, they placed more orders with them. In order to avoid the situation where seamless steel tubes that could be produced domestically were ordered from abroad, the plant director and Soviet experts went to Beijing to understand the situation of ordering from abroad. They discovered several thousand tons of order forms that should not have been ordered from abroad and actively suggested that relevant departments hand them over to them for production and supply. This approach is beneficial to the factory in exerting its production capacity and saves the country a large amount of foreign exchange.
    By 1956, large-scale new factories successively started production, and large-scale construction projects successively began. The situation changed dramatically. At this time, the plant's contradiction was no longer the problem of "not having enough to eat," but how to quickly meet the growing needs. This contradiction became even more prominent in 1957. Although the plant's planned output in 1957 increased by more than one time compared to 1955, the country still lacked more than 50,000 tons of seamless steel tubes. At this time, merely increasing new varieties was not enough; it was also necessary to further tap the factory's equipment potential to achieve a major leap in production capacity.
        Organizing a Great Leap Forward
    This raises a new question: Can a newly built factory with complex technology and many products rapidly leap forward in production? The seamless steel tube plant's answer is affirmative. If the plant's output in 1955 is taken as 100, it increased to 191 in 1956, 235 in 1957, and will increase to 294 in 1958, exceeding the original design level by two-thirds. This fact shows that a new factory built with the help of the Soviet Union, because it is equipped with the latest technology, has enormous equipment potential. Therefore, as long as under the guidance of Soviet experts and advanced Soviet experience, after basically and comprehensively mastering the new technology, the original designed production level can be leaped through based on the experience created by the masses of employees in practice. It is of course wrong not to seriously learn advanced Soviet technology, not to work hard to maintain new equipment, and to rashly change production methods; however, if, after the masses have mastered the production technology of the new factory and have accumulated new experience in production practice, they are still satisfied with the originally designed production level, that is also incorrect.
    On this issue, the seamless steel tube plant emphasizes both adopting a cautious and scientific attitude and truly mastering production technology; at the same time, it actively and boldly carries out necessary technical transformations based on the practical experience of the masses to break through the originally designed production level. They improved process methods and increased equipment utilization, increasing the plant's total output by about 10%. Shortening auxiliary time increased the plant's total output by about 5%. Reducing production interruption time increased the plant's operating rate from 78% the year before last to 85%, and will be increased to 88% this year.

    新建工厂跃进的榜样
    鞍钢无缝钢管厂生产和试制成功的新产品，比原设计的品种增加三倍左右；1958年这个厂的计划产量超过设计能力三分之二；第二个五年计划期间，他们还要把产量提高到使一个无缝钢管厂相当于两个无缝钢管厂。
    本报讯　记者陈迹、金雨困报道：从1953年10月27日下午两点半钟，第一根无缝钢管像条火龙似的从穿孔机里飞跑出
  来，到现在已经相隔五个年头。在这五年
  当中，鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂像许多新建工厂一样，曾经遭遇到品种不能适
  应需要，设备潜力不能充分发挥的困难。但是，这个厂的职工也像全国不少新建工厂的职工一样，不断克服了面前的困难，使生产有了飞跃的发展。早在前年，这个厂的产量就超过了原设计的生产水平；去年的产量已经比设计水平高出三分之一；今年计划产量将比设计产量高出三分之二。在第二个五年计划期间，它的年产量将比设计年产量增加一倍；也就是说，一个无缝钢管厂变成了两个无缝钢管厂。这是一个很大的跃进。
    “吃不饱”的困境
    起初，人们曾经以为：像我们这样大的国家，到处都在建设，生产出大量无缝钢管，是不会发愁没有地方用的。事实却不尽然。无缝钢管厂投入生产以后，竟出乎意料地陷入了“吃不饱”的困境。开工后第二年——1954年，按照生产能力，满可以生产四万吨无缝钢管；但是订货却只有一万九千多吨，结果不得不把产量计划压低到二万三千吨。1955年因为订货不多，也把计划压低了。由于生产任务不足，每天只能两班生产，经常有三、四百人没有活干，有些设备也闲置起来。职工们意见很多。更严重的是，产量即使压得这样低，也仍然有许多钢管销不出去，需要设法出口。
    发生这种情况，并不是因为设计时把产品品种规定错了。随着国家建设事业的发展，将大量需要这些品种。但是，由于当时我国第一个五年计划才开始，巨大的建设工程不多，大型的设备制造较少，原设计规定的较大的无缝钢管暂时就用不上。当时迫切需要的倒是原设计不准备生产的较小的多品种的无缝钢管。例如，机车检修用的小管子，全国一年至少需要五千吨；地质勘探用的钻杆，一年也要四千多吨。这就形成了这样一种不协调的局面：一方面工厂“吃不饱”，生产能力不能充分发挥；另一方面，全国所需要的大部分无缝钢管却要依靠国外进口。
    在这种国家需要的品种和工厂生产的品种互相矛盾的状况下，究竟应该采取怎样的方针来进行生产呢？是积极增加新品种来适应国家的需要呢？还是呆板地按照原设计所规定的品种来进行生产呢？按照原来的设计，无缝钢管厂的产品品种比较单纯，仅有40—140公厘外径的二十多种钢管。这种生产方法，在有较多的无缝钢管厂、能够在品种上进行合理分工的条件下，对于大量流水生产和稳定产品质量是有利的。但是目前我国还只有一个无缝钢管厂，国家迫切需要的品种应该尽可能由它来供应；同时，我国还没有冷拔的钢管厂，一些本来应该由冷拔生产的小钢管也需要由无缝钢管厂来生产。无论是为了满足国家的需要，还是为了保证工厂正常生产，单纯按照原设计品种进行生产的路子都是走不通的。
        增加新品种
    无缝钢管厂采取了积极的方针，努力来扩大和增加新的钢管品种。这几年，他们从原设计二十多种品种增加到四十多种，同时试制成了三十多种原设计没有的合金钢管。此外，他们还生产了一些比原设计规格更大的钢管，如石油工业部门在沙漠地带送水用的几十个压力的大钢管和建筑工程部门代替角铁用的柱子等。新增加品种的产量占全厂产量的三分之一左右。
    无缝钢管厂刚刚建设起来，马上就搞这么多新品种的生产，当然不是一种很容易的事情。新品种的规格繁杂，产品比较零星，安排生产很不方便。许多新品种还要由热轧代替冷轧，在技术掌握上也很困难。无缝钢管厂的职工们抱着不怕麻烦的态度，积极钻研新技术，争取多试制一些新品种。即使是数量少到四、五根的合金钢管，他们也积极去生产。吉林化工区安装一种最新式的设备——管式炉，需要一种合金钢管。这种钢管苏联还在试制，不能供应；后来经过苏联专家研究，让无缝钢管厂试轧，轧了多次，终于轧制成功，帮助吉林化工区及时安装好了管式炉。增加新品种的生产，不但满足了国家多方面的迫切需要，锻炼了全厂职工，使他们很快提高了技术水平，而且为今后迅速提高生产能力、生产技术更复杂的品种奠定了良好的基础。
      扩大产品销路
    这个厂在增加新品种的同时，还积极到各地招揽货源，扩大产品销路。各地有关单位了解了这座新工厂的品种、质量等情况以后，向他们订货的便多起来了。他们为了避免发生国内能够争取生产的无缝钢管向国外订货的情况，厂长和苏联专家曾经到北京了解向国外订货的情况，发现了几千吨不应该向国外订货的货单，便主动建议有关部门交给他们生产供应。这种做法，既有利于工厂发挥生产能力，又为国家节省了大量外汇。
    到1956年，新建的大型工厂陆续开工生产，规模巨大的建设工程相继动工，情况发生了极大的变化。这时候，这个厂的矛盾已经不再是“吃不饱”的问题，而是怎样迅速满足日益增长的需要的问题了。这种矛盾到1957年显得更为突出。1957年这个厂的计划产量虽然比1955年增加一倍以上，但是国家还缺少五万多吨无缝钢管。在这个时候，仅仅增加新品种已经不够了，还必须进一步发掘工厂的设备潜力，使生产能力有一个大的跃进。
        组织大跃进
    这就产生了一个新的问题：一个新建的工厂，技术复杂，产品繁多，能不能使生产迅速跃进？无缝钢管厂的回答是肯定的。这个工厂的产量如以1955年为一百，1956年增加为一百九十一，1957年增加为二百三十五，1958年将增加为二百九十四，超出原设计水平三分之二。这个事实说明：一个在苏联帮助下建成的新工厂，由于它是用最新的技术装备起来的，它的设备潜力是巨大的，因此只要在苏联专家和苏联先进经验的指导下，在基本上全面掌握了新技术以后，就可以根据职工群众在实践中创造的经验，来飞跃地突破原设计的生产水平。不认真学习苏联先进技术，不努力维护好新的设备，就轻举妄动地改变生产方法，当然是错误的；但是，在群众已经掌握了新工厂的生产技术，并且在生产实践中积累了新的经验以后，如果仍然满足于原设计的生产水平，那也是不对的。
    无缝钢管厂在这个问题上，既强调采取谨慎的科学的态度，切实掌握好生产技术；同时又积极大胆地根据群众的实践经验，进行必要的技术改造，来突破原设计的生产水平。他们改善工艺方法，提高设备利用率，使全厂总产量提高10％左右。缩短辅助时间，使全厂总产量提高5％左右。减少生产间断时间，使全厂作业率从前年的78％提高到85％，今年还要提高到88％。
