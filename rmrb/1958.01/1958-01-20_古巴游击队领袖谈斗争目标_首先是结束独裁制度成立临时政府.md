The article stated the goals of the Cuban guerrillas' struggle.

Castro wrote: "The purpose of our fight is first of all: to end the dictatorship in Cuba and lay the foundation for the establishment of a truly representative government."

Castro advocated that a special congress composed of representatives of various civic groups should appoint a provisional government. The basic task of this provisional government would be to prepare for and hold genuine general elections within one year.

The article pointed out that the insurgents have formulated a number of programmatic regulations that should form the basis for the work of the provisional government. These regulations stipulate: the immediate release of all political prisoners, the realization of freedom of the press, the restoration of the political rights of all citizens, the implementation of land reform, the elimination of illiteracy, and the industrialization of the country.

Reporter George also published an article in the magazine, pointing out that there are currently more than a thousand guerrillas active in Cuba under Castro's leadership.

Castro's fighters are well equipped, and their weapons are mainly seized from government troops.

    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社纽约18日讯：美国“王冠”杂志刊载了该报特派记者乔治从古巴游击区带回来的古巴游击队领袖卡斯特罗的一篇文章，文章申述了古巴游击队的斗争目标。
    卡斯特罗写道：“我们战斗的目的首先是：结束古巴独裁制度，并且为建立一个真正具有代表性的政府打下基础。”
    卡斯特罗主张由各公民团体的代表组成一个特别代表大会，任命一个临时政府，这个临时政府的基本任务是在一年内筹备和举行真正的普选。
    文章指出，起义者已经制订了许多纲领性条例，这些条例应该成为临时政府工作的基础。这些条例规定：立即释放一切政治犯，实现出版自由，恢复全体公民的政治权利，实行土地改革，扫除文盲和使国家工业化。
