    The Thought-Provoking “Sisters”
    Zhao Yunru
    Whenever we see a good movie or play, we always want to think about what makes it good and what we can learn from it. However, with a complete movie or play, it's often difficult to discern which part of the work—the writer's, director's, or actors'—is the most unique. In fact, only when each part of the work has achieved relatively good results can a complete effect be obtained. After watching the new Japanese film "Sisters," I had this feeling.
    The film has no bizarre plot, no extraordinary montage, and not even strong dramatic tension. At the beginning of the film, the younger sister, Junko, is still an extremely innocent and lively child. She is honest, and she won't lie to creditors. She loves her parents, siblings, friends, and classmates, and she also loves to eat and play. The older sister, Keiko, is only two or three years older than Junko, but she already understands the hardships of her elders. She is gentle and quiet. Both sisters are very lovable. However, the older sister is somewhat influenced by the previous generation, is more worldly-wise, and tries to get rid of the misfortunes in her life by believing in God, but this actually further restricts her vision, forcing her to take the path of self-sacrifice as a form of self-consolation in the end. The younger sister, on the other hand, is different. She dares to pursue the truth, and she never yields or bows her head to life! The film profoundly reveals their different fates and paths through its depiction of the daily lives of the two sisters in school and at home.
    On the surface, what is presented on the screen are fragments of the sisters' lives over several years, with almost no specific story, but the author uses a simple and profound approach to reveal huge social problems in ordinary events. The author organically connects the fragments of life, suggesting that Japanese society is like a muddy river that is still flowing but will inevitably become silted up. People struggle bitterly and painstakingly to avoid being submerged. However, in the end, they have no choice but to be swept into the abyss with indignation! Here, Chiyo (a friend of the sisters) who died young, Tamura who committed suicide by throwing himself into the river, and even Keiko are all submerged in this way. However, in the same muddy river, the strong Junko and the young worker Okano, and others, are always unyielding. The more fierce the waves crash, the faster they float to the surface. What they represent is the strength of millions of new forces. From her (his) actions, we are deeply convinced that she (he) will not only swim to the other shore, but will also clear away the deadly mud of life sooner or later! No, this is not a fragment of life, but the essence of life.
    The structure of the film is rigorous. There are no superfluous shots, no wasted lines. Moreover, some actions and lines even exceed the function of explaining the environment, developing character, and introducing the plot. Obviously, the director is aware of the internal connections of these fragments of life. He handles them with refinement and restraint, using a concise and beautiful technique to highlight the theme. If we compare the dialogue and actions given by the author to each chess piece, each containing multiple layers of meaning, then the director's handling is like providing a visual annotation for why each chess piece should be moved in this way. Moreover, these annotations do not reveal any traces of carving, and can only be appreciated after careful chewing after watching the film. For example, on the suspension bridge near the power plant, the first time the sisters walk on it, they walk past, head to head, laughing. The second time, the older sister stands alone on it, reminiscing about her younger sister. The third time, the family sends Keiko off to get married, and she passes by here, only glancing at the power plant, where Okano, whom she loves, is working. How much of the great changes in life do these three appearances of the bridge explain! Also, how poetically does Junko's spirit of going against the current express itself when she finally climbs up the mountain peak next to her home, chasing the vehicle carrying Keiko to be married, and shouting "Sister! Be strong!"
    The film reveals social problems in an atmosphere full of love and humor. The screen does not show a single reactionary ruler's hideous face, but you constantly feel a kind of resistance stifling people's beautiful wishes. Therefore, many humorous scenes make you unclear whether the tears are from laughter or crying after you've been doubled over with laughter. For example, Junko's classmate Minami insists on kissing Junko. The childishness of the two girls pouting their little mouths will make anyone laugh, but when you think that Minami may never have received warmth from her family, and also associate it with the reason why her family is disabled—the Hiroshima event was exactly the year her younger brother, who never grew up, was born! And at the same time as this scene, Keiko is praying in church, but what explanation does the merciful God give for the suffering of these countless disabled people? At this point, you can no longer laugh. This is how the director uses vivid and strong contrasts to evoke our associations. When the screen finally shows people sending Keiko off to be married in a tragic comedy amidst revelry, the audience can only ponder in a state of mixed laughter and tears.

    令人深思的“姊妹”
    赵韫如
    每当我们看到好的电影或话剧时，总想回想一下好在哪里？该学些什么？但是，完整的电影或话剧，往往使你很难去鉴别在作家、导演、演员中究竟哪部分工作最有独到之处。事实上只有每部分工作都具有较好的成绩，才能获得完整的效果。看完日本新片“姊妹”后，我就有这种感觉。
    影片没有离奇的情节，没有不平凡的蒙太奇，甚至没有强烈的戏剧性。影片开始时，妹妹俊子还是个极其天真活泼的孩子，她诚实，见了债主也不会撒谎，她爱父母、姊弟、朋友、同学，她也爱吃爱玩。姊姊圭子比俊子只大两三岁，但却已懂得体贴长辈的艰辛，她是娴静温柔的。两姊妹都很可爱。可是姊姊多少受了上一代的影响，世故一些，并且企图以信仰天主来摆脱生活中的不幸，但这实际上就更加束缚了她的视野，使她最后不得不走以自我牺牲来自慰的道路。妹妹则不然，她勇于追求真理，她始终不肯向生活屈服低头！影片通过对于姊妹俩的学校和家庭的日常生活的描写，深刻揭示出了她们的不同的命运和道路。
    表面看来，银幕上呈现的是姊妹俩数年间生活的片断，几乎没有一个具体故事，但作者却运用深入浅出的手法，在平凡的事件中揭示了巨大的社会问题。作者把片断的生活有机地联系起来，暗示出日本的社会正像一条尚在流动而必将淤塞的泥河。人们茹苦含辛竭力挣扎，以求不遭没顶。然而最后却不得不含着愤懑被旋入深渊！这里以早死的初江（姊妹俩的朋友）、投河自杀了的田村，甚至包括圭子都是这样沉没的。但是在同一条泥河中，刚健的俊子和青年工人冈野等却始终不屈，浪潮冲击得愈凶愈猛，他们就愈快地浮上水面，他们所代表的是千千万万的新生力量，从她（他）们的行动中，我们深信她（他）们不仅会游向彼岸，而且早晚会清除生活中致命的污泥的！不，这不是生活的片断，而是生活的本质。
    影片的结构是严密的。没有多余的镜头，没有浪费的对白。而且有的动作和对白甚至超过了说明环境、发展性格、介绍情节等的作用。显然导演是洞察这些生活断片的内部联系的。他处理得精练、含蓄，以简洁的美的手法，突出了主题思想。如果我们把作者给予的对话与动作比作每粒棋子那样蕴蓄着多层作用，那么导演在处理上，正像给每粒棋子为什么要这样走作了形象化的注解。而且这些注解丝毫不露雕琢的痕迹，只有在看完影片后细细咀嚼时才能体会得到。比如在发电公司附近的吊桥上，第一次姊妹俩在上面走时，头靠头地嬉笑着走过，第二次姊姊单独站在上面怀念妹妹，第三次是家人送圭子出嫁，她从这里经过，她只对发电公司看了一眼，那里有她所爱的冈野在工作，这三次桥的出现阐明了多少生活中的巨大的变化！又如俊子最后飞快地爬上家旁的山峰，追着出嫁的圭子所乘的车辆，高呼“姊姊！坚强起来”时，又多么诗意地表现了她的逆流而上的精神！
    影片在充满了爱充满了幽默感的气氛中揭露了社会问题。银幕上并未出现一个反动统治者的狰狞面貌，但你不时感到有一种阻力在扼杀人们美好的愿望。因此许多诙谐的场面，使你在捧腹之余，自己也闹不清眼泪是笑出来的还是哭出来的。比如俊子的同学敏美，坚持要与俊子亲吻，两个女孩呶起小嘴的稚气，谁看了都会发笑，可当你想到敏美可能从未得到过家庭的温暖，也联想到她一家残废的原因——广岛事件恰恰是她的长不大的弟弟出生的那年！而在这场戏的同时，圭子又正在教堂祈祷，可是仁慈的上帝对这无数残废者的痛苦作何解释？至此你也就笑不出来了。导演就是这样运用了鲜明而强烈的对比来唤起我们的联想的。当最后银幕上出现人们在狂欢中送圭子出嫁这场悲剧性的喜剧时，观众也只有在哭笑不得中沉思了。
