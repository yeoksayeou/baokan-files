To the Editor:

    Since the Party organization proposed streamlining institutions and transferring cadres, many cadres have been transferred. In order to take care of the special needs of cadres after going to the countryside, many units have given them several months of living allowance at once before they go, which is necessary. However, because some comrades lack planning in using money, they squander it as soon as they receive it. They are busy watching movies, plays, going to restaurants, and buying gifts for others. As a result, some people spend several months' living allowance in one or two weeks, and apply to the organization for re-subsidies when they are about to go down. We believe that this issue should be given urgent attention by relevant leaders, and education on building the country and managing households diligently and thriftily should be strengthened for transferred cadres, and they should be educated to properly arrange their living allowances.

### 教育下放干部不要乱花钱

    教育下放干部不要乱花钱编辑同志：
    党组织提出紧缩机构下放干部以后，许多干部下放了。为了照顾干部下乡以后的一些特殊需要，很多单位都在他们下去以前，一次发给了好几个月的生活补助费，这是需要的。但是，由于一些同志用钱缺乏计划，一拿到钱，就大肆挥霍起来。他们忙着看电影、看戏、下饭馆、买礼物送人。这样，有的人便把几个月的生活补助费在一两个星期内花得一干二净，临下去时，又申请组织重新补助。我们认为这个问题亟应引起有关领导的重视，加紧对下放干部进行勤俭建国、勤俭持家的教育，教育他们妥善安排生活补助费。　　　萧芳洲
