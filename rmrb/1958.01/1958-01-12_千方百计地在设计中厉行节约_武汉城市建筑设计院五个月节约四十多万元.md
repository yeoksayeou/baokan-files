Spare No Effort to Practice Economy in Design
Wuhan Urban Construction Design Institute Saves More Than 400,000 Yuan in Five Months

    (By our reporter) The designers of the Wuhan Urban Construction Design Institute are sparing no effort to practice economy in design. In the past five months, they have saved more than 400,000 yuan in investment for the country.
    The designers first changed their past attitude of "being responsive to every request" and "spending as much money as you have" when dealing with construction units. Before starting the design, they carefully studied the design task book and, based on the principles of "economy, practicality, and appropriate attention to aesthetics" and the importance and urgency of the project, considered whether there was any possibility of saving. When designing the flooring project for the Hubei Provincial Materials Reserve Bureau, the designers of the Second Office, Second Group, found that 6,200 square meters of flooring could be postponed or reduced. They consulted with the construction unit, which readily agreed, resulting in a saving of more than 36,000 yuan in investment for this project. The four-story teaching building of Zhongnan University of Political Science and Law was originally planned to have all the exterior walls covered with terrazzo and wooden floors inside. This would have been more luxurious, of course, but it would have cost more than 50,000 yuan. The designers believed that using reinforced concrete floors would be more economical and better for fire prevention; and that using a combination of fair-faced and painted finishes for the exterior walls, instead of terrazzo, could also achieve the requirements of solidity and aesthetics. They finally persuaded the construction unit to change these two designs, and with the addition of some other cost-saving measures in the design, the project saved a total of more than 100,000 yuan, equivalent to 20% of the total investment in the project.
    The designers also actively sought to use local materials and replace expensive building materials with cheaper ones. For example, young technician Li Houzhong suggested using bamboo pipes instead of iron pipes for the design of lighting circuits, which could reduce the cost by more than one yuan per meter and save 0.7 kg of metal. This suggestion was approved for trial by the Wuhan Electric Power Bureau and received the support of the construction unit. It has now been used in twenty large and small projects, saving the state a total of more than 24,000 yuan and saving 23 tons of metal pipes. When designing the residential project for the Hanyang Paper Mill, engineer Yang Jiye went deep into the site to understand the situation and found that there were very cheap reeds nearby that could be used as lightweight partition walls, and that the mill's slag could be used as a mixing material for the flooring. He adopted these materials in the design, saving the state a total of more than 23,000 yuan. (Liao Fabin)

    千方百计地在设计中厉行节约
    武汉城市建筑设计院五个月节约四十多万元
    本报讯　武汉城市建筑设计院的设计人员千方百计地在设计中厉行节约。五个月来已经为国家节约了四十多万元投资。
    设计人员们首先改变了过去同建设单位打交道时采取的“有求必应”、“你有多少钱，我就给你花多少钱”的态度。在开始设计以前，先仔细研究设计任务书，根据“经济，适用，适当照顾美观”的原则和工程的轻重缓急，看是否有节约的可能。二室二组的设计人员在设计湖北省物资储备局的地坪工程时，发现有六千二百平方公尺的地坪可以缓建或者削减。他们就去同建设单位协商，建设单位也欣然同意，结果使这项工程节约投资三万六千多元。中南政法学院的四层教学大楼，原来计划把大楼外墙全部做上水磨石子的面层，室内做木楼板。这样当然豪华一些，但是要多花五万多元。设计人员认为，用钢筋混凝土楼板既节省又利于防火；外墙采用清水和混水相配合的处理方法，不用水磨石子，同样能够达到坚固和美观的要求。他们终于说服了建设单位，改变了这两处设计，再加上在设计中采取了一些其他的节约措施，这项工程共节约了十万多元，相等于这项工程总投资的20％。
    设计人员们还积极设法就地取材，用便宜的建筑材料代替贵重材料。例如，青年技术员李厚锺建议在设计照明电路管时用竹管代替铁管，每公尺可以降低造价一元多，节约金属零点七公斤。这一建议经武汉电业局同意试行，得到了建设单位的支持。现在，已经将它用于二十个大小工程，共为国家节约资金二万四千多元，节省金属管二十三吨。工程师杨继业在设计汉阳造纸厂的住宅工程时，深入现场了解情况，发现这个厂附近有很便宜的芦苇可以作轻隔墙，这个厂的炉渣可以用来作筑地坪的配料。他在设计中采用了这些材料，共为国家节约二万三千多元。　（廖发斌）
