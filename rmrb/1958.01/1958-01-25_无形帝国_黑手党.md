    The Invisible Empire – Mafia

    One gloomy, rainy afternoon, dozens of brand-new, beautiful cars drove to the outskirts of a small town in upstate New York and stopped in front of a magnificent villa. Sixty-five well-dressed guests got out of the cars and were happily greeted by the host. As they were busily gambling, feasting, and toasting, the New York State Police dispatched a group of military police, and all sixty-five guests were arrested and taken to the police station.

    Who are they? According to a report from the New York State Police Department, they are drug-trafficking smugglers, female trafficking pimps, murderers, hooligans, rascals, and all sorts of gang leaders. Since there was no "evidence" when they were arrested, they were released after spending a few hours in the police station.

    What were they doing? The New York State Police Department said that the purpose of the gathering of sixty-five terrifying figures was to discuss how to handle the internal problems of the invisible empire—the Mafia—after the assassination of "chief executioner" of "Murder, Inc.," Anastasia.

    According to "Newsweek," the chairman of the sixty-five-person meeting, the leader of the American invisible empire—the Mafia—Jerovis (pictured), is an American of Italian descent. Since 1917, he has been engaged in murder and robbery in the United States.

    According to the "Washington Post," the American Mafia was founded on September 7, 1931. On that day, representatives of various American gangs and associations gathered in New York to determine the organization of the invisible empire. "Murder, Inc." was merely the execution squad of this invisible empire. Important figures in the Mafia are outwardly respectable businessmen, and some have even seized important positions in yellow trade unions. Most of the sixty-five "important figures" came from New York City, while others came from California, Texas, Ohio, and even Cuba and other places. They secretly engage in horrifying criminal activities, while the authorities turn a blind eye.

    According to a report by a committee of the U.S. Senate, even the garbage disposal and transportation industry in New York is now controlled by the Mafia.

    无形帝国——黑手党
    阴雨蒙蒙的一天下午，数十辆崭新的、漂亮的小汽车开到了纽约州北部一个小城的郊外，停在一所华丽的别墅面前。六十五位衣冠楚楚的客人下了车，兴高采烈地受着主人的招待。当他们正在呼卢喝雉、觥筹交错之际，纽约州警察当局派来了一批军警，六十五名客人全数被捕，押送警局。
    他们是什么人？据纽约州警察局的报告，他们是贩毒的走私商人、贩运妇女的恶棍、杀人犯、流氓、无赖和形形色色的帮会首脑。由于被捕时并无“罪证”，因此，在警局里呆了几小时以后，他们就被释放了。
    他们在干什么？纽约州警察当局说，六十五名恐怖人物聚会的目的是：商讨如何处理因“暗杀公司”“首席刽子手”阿纳斯塔西亚被刺身死后无形帝国——黑手党的内部问题。
    据“新闻周刊”称，六十五人集会的主席、美国无形帝国——黑手党的党魁吉罗弗斯（附图）是祖籍意大利的美国人。从1917年起，他就在美国干杀人越货的勾当。
    据“华盛顿邮报”报道，美国黑手党是1931年9月7日成立的。那一天，美国各地匪党帮会代表在纽约集会，确定了无形帝国的组织。“暗杀公司”只是这个无形帝国的执刑队。黑手党的重要人物在外表上都是正正经经的商人，有的还窃据了黄色工会的要职。六十五个“要人”，大半来自纽约城，其他的有从加利福尼亚、得克萨斯、俄亥俄等州来的，也有从古巴等地来的。他们暗中干着骇人听闻的罪恶活动，而当局竟熟视无睹。
    据美国参议院一个调查委员会的报告，现在连纽约的垃圾清除运输业也被黑手党抓到手上去了。
