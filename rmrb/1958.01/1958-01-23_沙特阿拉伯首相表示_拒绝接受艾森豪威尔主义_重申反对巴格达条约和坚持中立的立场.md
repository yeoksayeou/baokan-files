Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd - According to a United Press International report from Cairo, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Faisal stated on the 21st that his government "refuses to accept the Eisenhower Doctrine because it does not believe in the theory of a power vacuum in the Middle East, which serves as the basis for this doctrine."

He further stated: "The Saudi King adheres to the principle of active neutrality and non-participation in foreign treaties, and supports the national liberation of all occupied lands from the shackles of imperialism."

The Saudi Arabian Crown Prince, who serves as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in the government, made these remarks during an exclusive interview with a United Press International reporter in Cairo. He was visiting Egypt on his way back from the United States.

Faisal said, "Our attitude towards the Baghdad Pact has not changed." Previously, the Saudi King had officially declared his government's opposition to the Baghdad Pact.

Crown Prince Faisal said, "As I understand it, the resolutions of the Cairo Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference reaffirmed the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, and the role and attitude of the Saudi Arabian government at the Bandung Conference are well known."

Referring to the issue of the Buraimi Oasis, occupied by Britain in October 1955, Faisal said, "Buraimi is an indivisible part of our country. Anyone who thinks we will stand idly by in the face of this aggression for long is mistaken."

He said that the Saudi Arabian government supports the independence cause of Oman, and the United Nations Security Council's refusal to discuss the issue does not affect the Imam's right to strive for freedom and self-determination.

Regarding the Egyptian-Syrian federal plan, he said, "The Saudi Arabian government, headed by His Majesty the Saudi King, has always supported any measures taken to achieve Arab unity."

    沙特阿拉伯首相表示
    拒绝接受艾森豪威尔主义
    重申反对巴格达条约和坚持中立的立场
    据新华社22日讯　据合众社开罗消息，沙特阿拉伯王储费萨尔21日说，他的政府“拒绝接受艾森豪威尔主义，因为它不相信作为这个主义的基础的中东力量真空的理论”。
    他又说：“沙特国王坚持积极中立和不参加外国条约的原则，支持一切被占领土地从帝国主义枷锁下获得民族解放。”
    这位沙特阿拉伯王储在政府中担任首相兼外交大臣，他在开罗单独接见合众社记者的时候说了这番话。他在从美国回国途中，到埃及进行访问。
    费萨尔说：“我们对巴格达条约的态度没有改变。”在以前，沙特国王曾正式宣布他的政府反对巴格达条约。
    费萨尔王储说：“据我理解，开罗亚非人民团结大会的决议重申了万隆会议的决议，沙特阿拉伯政府在万隆会议上的作用和态度是大家知道的。”
    谈到1955年10月为英国占领的布赖米绿洲问题，费萨尔说：“布赖米是我国不可分割的一部分。如果有人认为我们会对这种侵略长期袖手旁观，那就错了。”
    他说，沙特阿拉伯政府支持阿曼的独立事业，联合国安全理事会拒绝讨论这个问题并不影响教长争取自由和自决的权利。
    关于埃叙联邦计划，他说：“以沙特国王陛下为首的沙特阿拉伯政府一向支持为实现阿拉伯团结而采取的任何措施。”
