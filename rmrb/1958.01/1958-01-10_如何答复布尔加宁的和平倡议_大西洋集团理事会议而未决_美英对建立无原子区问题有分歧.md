Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 9th: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Permanent Representatives Council met here on January 8th to discuss how Western nations should respond to the peace initiatives proposed in the letters from Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin. According to reports, the focus of the meeting was the British government's draft reply to the Soviet Union. The meeting discussed the suggestion made by British Prime Minister Macmillan to conclude a mutual non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, but no conclusion was reached.

The meeting lasted for three hours and is scheduled to reconvene on the 10th to continue discussing the issue. Sources say that the proposal to conclude a mutual non-aggression treaty forced the council to postpone its decision on a response to Bulganin's letters.

It was also revealed that the meeting on the 8th also discussed Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe and the Soviet Union's recent announcement to further reduce its armed forces by 300,000.

According to a Washington dispatch from "The New York Times," diplomatic sources have revealed that there are differences between the US and the UK regarding their attitudes toward the proposal to declare East and West Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia as areas free of nuclear weapons and rocket bases.

The newspaper wrote that Britain is said to be willing to further discuss this proposal, while the US State Department believes that it is militarily disadvantageous and politically dangerous. The US believes that establishing such a zone is the first step towards the neutralization of Germany, and then other countries.

    如何答复布尔加宁的和平倡议
    大西洋集团理事会议而未决
    美英对建立无原子区问题有分歧
    据新华社9日讯　巴黎消息：北大西洋集团常任代表理事会1月8日在这里开会，讨论西方各国如何答复苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁信件中所提出的和平倡议。据报道，这次会议讨论的中心是英国政府对苏联的答复草稿。会上对英国首相麦克米伦提出的可以同苏联缔结互不侵犯条约的建议进行了讨论，但是没有得出任何结论。
    这次会议举行了三个小时，定在10日再开会继续讨论这个问题。有消息说，关于缔结互不侵犯条约的主张迫使理事会推迟了就布尔加宁信件作出答复的决定。
    据透露，8日的会议还讨论了波兰所提出的关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议和苏联最近宣布再裁减军队三十万人的决定。
    另据“纽约时报”华盛顿消息说，从外交人士获悉，美英之间在对于宣布东西德、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克为不设置核武器和火箭基地地区的建议的态度上存在着分歧。
    报纸写道，据说，英国愿意进一步讨论这个建议，而美国国务院认为这从军事方面看来是没有好处的，从政治方面看来是危险的。美国认为，设立这样一个区域是德国，然后是其他国家走向中立化的第一步。
