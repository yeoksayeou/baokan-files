Cultivating One Mu of Land as if it were Three Mu
                  Li Jiping, Secretary of the Xingtai Prefectural Party Committee

    With only a little over five fen of land per person, income can still exceed that of prosperous middle peasants and merchants.

    In 1957, seven cooperatives in the Xingtai area already had grain yields exceeding 1,000 jin per mu, and one cooperative had cotton yields of 380 jin per mu. Here, I will introduce one of them: the Hongguang First Cooperative in Nan'yuan Village, Xingtai City. This cooperative averaged over 1,000 jin of grain and 17,000 jin of vegetables per mu in 1957. The cooperative consists of 76 households with 317 people, averaging only 0.55 mu of land per person. Before liberation, 53 out of 64 households in the village were tenant farmers, living in hunger and cold. The masses used this folk song to describe their life at that time: "Work hard or work slowly, supporting the landlords and bosses, year after year, suffering every year." After liberation and the implementation of land reform, although the lives of most farmers improved compared to before, they were still weak financially, lacking farm tools and livestock. The increase in grain and vegetable yields on the cultivated land was limited, generally around 200 jin per mu, which was still insufficient to maintain their lives. Many people believed that there was no future in managing agricultural production with so little land, and they were unwilling to actively participate in agricultural production, saying: "Half a mu of land per person, a yield of 6.5 dou, although we've been liberated, life is still hard." Many people still relied on carrying goods as petty merchants or working as small laborers or handicraft workers in the city to make a living. In 1956, the village established an agricultural cooperative. In the first year after cooperativization, grain yield increased to 605 jin per mu, and the average net income per member reached 112 yuan. In 1957, there was a great leap forward in agricultural production, with grain yield reaching 1,112 jin per mu and vegetables yielding 17,553 jin per mu. The total income of the cooperative was over 55,000 yuan. After deducting public grain, cooperative expenses, and public accumulation, the average income per person in the cooperative was 155 yuan. Because agricultural production income increased, the members not only escaped poverty but also exceeded the production and living standards of wealthy middle peasants in the past. According to the 1957 distribution results, among the 76 households in the cooperative, 4 households had incomes above 1,000 yuan, 25 households had incomes between 700 and 1,000 yuan, 17 households had incomes between 500 and 700 yuan, 28 households had incomes between 200 and 500 yuan, and 2 households had incomes above 100 yuan (one person each). Before the advanced cooperativization, the average income per person of the three leading wealthy middle peasant households, Li Yongxiang, Li Zhanguang, and Li Lun, was not as high as the current average income per member. The wealthy middle peasant Li Yongxiang also increased his income compared to before joining the cooperative because of his active participation in labor. When he was working individually, his family of four had an average income of 104.6 yuan per person; in 1957, his family of three had an average income of over 322 yuan per person.

    With the increase in income, the lives of the members have also greatly improved. Now every household in the village has mosquito nets, quilts, thermos bottles, and rubber shoes, and many people have bought bicycles, woolen clothes, and built new houses. In 1956, 54 households owed 5,000 yuan in loans to state banks and credit cooperatives; in 1957, these households not only repaid all the loans, but also 70% of the households in the cooperative deposited 6,000 yuan in the credit cooperative. Gong Xin'an used to be a tenant farmer who had to beg with his daughter because his income could not sustain his life. In 1957, he and his wife received more than 600 yuan in the cooperative and were so happy that they told everyone they met: "If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the establishment of advanced cooperatives, we wouldn't be where we are today!" Zhang Rong, a 56-year-old member, said that cooperativization turned his poor life into a rich one. Jia Jinfu, a member who used to sell cigarettes, now participates in labor in the cooperative, working 309.9 workdays a year, with each workday worth 1.57 yuan, and has already received 486.54 yuan. He and his wife are currently living a very prosperous life. Jia Hongbin, who did not join the cooperative, earned only 360 yuan a year (ten months) by pushing a cart to sell goods every day, and his family of four (wife and two children) had little surplus after living expenses. Wei Erxiao was unwilling to work in the cooperative and went to the city to work as a plasterer, earning only 1.2 yuan a day. He could only work half a year on average, earning only over 200 yuan a year. Now, seeing that agricultural cooperative members have higher incomes, he has repeatedly confessed his mistakes to the cooperative director and asked to rejoin the cooperative.

    The Enthusiasm and Creativity of the Masses Have Been Brought into Play
            One Mu of Land is Cultivated as Three Mu

    The male and female members of this cooperative have been working selflessly since the beginning of last spring. Elsewhere, the land is cultivated for one or two seasons, while their cooperative cultivates the land for three or four seasons. Other cooperatives irrigate four or five times, while they irrigate eight times. Other cooperatives apply 7,000 to 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, while they apply 20,000 to 24,000 jin. Where does this production enthusiasm come from? In addition to the fact that increased production and income have stimulated everyone's enthusiasm, the socialist red banner competition has played a significant role. They persistently implemented the production competition movement throughout the year's production activities. In the production competition, they paid attention to using the advanced to lead the backward. For example, the advanced First Team led the Second and Third Teams, reversing the slow progress of fertilizer accumulation and wheat management. Secretary Li Cong not only went deep into the Second Team to lead production, but also set an example by participating in production himself, earning more than 3,000 work points last year alone. Director Li Cun often went deep into the production teams and production groups to help each team solve problems concretely and continuously conducted socialist education for the members.

    At the beginning of 1957, all members of the Hongguang First Cooperative responded to the Party's call to "do everything possible to strive for a bumper harvest" and launched activities in each production team to offer suggestions and plans for striving for a bumper harvest. Encouraged by the bumper harvest of 1956, the members, in order to continue striving for a bumper harvest, actively and conscientiously considered various ways to increase production from all aspects. They first analyzed the specific production conditions and characteristics of the cooperative and realized that: in order to increase income on an average of 0.55 mu of land per person, in addition to applying more fertilizer, improving technology, reasonably irrigating, and meticulously managing to increase unit yield, the only way is to improve multiple cropping technology and increase the multiple cropping index of the land, "cultivating one mu of land as if it were three mu." Li Chengbin, the captain of the Second Production Team, also put forward his past experience in multiple cropping, explaining: as long as we master the growing period of different crops and adopt intercropping, mixed cropping, and crop rotation methods to improve land utilization, it is entirely possible to achieve a yield of one mu equivalent to three mu and a yield of 1,000 jin per mu.

    The management committee followed the mass line in leading production, brought into play the wisdom of the masses, and adopted the opinions of Li Chengbin and others. In 1957, some land was planted four or five times a year. The cooperative implemented intercropping and crop rotation of grain and vegetables on 96 mu of land, increasing the sown area of grain crops to 178 mu, yielding 71,529 jin of grain; after the grain harvest, another 87.6 mu of vegetables were planted. In this way, grain and vegetables were planted on 265.6 mu of land on these 96 mu, with a multiple cropping index reaching 276.6%. Among them, 73.6 mu were multiple cropped three times (one season of wheat, one season of millet or corn, and one season of cabbage); 22.4 mu were multiple cropped twice (one season of wheat and one season of yam or vegetables). Why was it possible to achieve such a high multiple cropping index? First of all, intercropping of grain and vegetables was implemented according to the length of the growing period of the crops. The growing period of wheat, Xiaobaigu millet and corn is 65 to 70 days, so they planted two seasons of grain and one season of vegetables on 62.6 mu of land. After the wheat was harvested, they planted Xiaobaigu millet or corn, and after the Xiaobaigu millet or corn was harvested, they planted cabbage. Secondly, they also used the characteristics of different crops to adopt cross-multiple cropping methods on 12 mu of cultivated land, planting 8 mu of wheat and 4 mu of north melon; the planting method was to plant one ridge of north melon every two ridges of wheat. When the wheat was about to ripen in the spring, the growth of the north melon seedlings was not hindered; when the wheat was harvested, the north melon vines spread. In this way, these 12 mu of land planted 8 mu more wheat; after the north melon was harvested, another season of cabbage was planted. The Third Team also created a method of sowing in the gaps of the vegetables. Because the seedlings need less nutrition when they are sown, they can grow normally in the gaps; when they are about to grow up, the previous crop will mature and be harvested. The Third Team planted three mu of shallots (narrow ridges) in the spring of 1957, and at the same time planted "May Fresh" cowpeas on the back of the shallot ridges; before the cowpeas were harvested, corn was planted on the back of the ridges; before the corn was harvested, cabbage was planted in the corn ridges. In this way, a season of grain crops can be planted in the vegetable fields that are planted three times. They also used the leisure time of vegetables to plant grain crops. For example, in the leek fields, corn was planted during the leek's leisure period in July, and cabbage was planted when the corn was about to be harvested. In this way, 380 jin of corn and 15,000 jin of cabbage were harvested per mu.

    The members of the Hongguang First Cooperative brought into play their enthusiasm and creativity and contributed so much to socialism on limited land! At the same time, the income of all the farmers in the cooperative has also greatly increased.

    Facts Educate People Who Abandon Agriculture for Business and Prefer Industry to Agriculture

    The facts of the past two years have educated some people who abandoned agriculture for business and prefer industry to agriculture. In the first year of running the cooperative, many people did not see the potential in agricultural production. They believed that the land was small, and no matter how much processing and increased production, it would not meet the needs of life. Therefore, many members did not actively participate in field labor, did not abide by the cooperative's labor discipline, and went out to do petty business or went to the city to work as workers at will. For example, Cheng Xiaosheng, a young member, believed that it was hard work and there was no future in doing farm work in the cooperative. He refused to participate in field labor and went to work in a shoe factory in the city, earning 0.7 yuan a day. Jia Zhongxiang did not participate in cooperative labor and carried a burden to sell vegetables every day, earning 0.5 yuan a day. In order to run the agricultural cooperative well and lead production well, the Party branch carried out political and ideological education work for all members in response to this situation, formulated agricultural production plans, pointed out the prospects for developing agricultural production to the members, and actively led the cooperative to do a good job in production, using the facts of increased production and income within the cooperative to educate the members. The Party branch called on all Party members and League members to actively take the lead in participating in production activities. Cheng Xiaosheng, who had not actively participated in production in the past, actively participated in labor after seeing that the agricultural cooperative could indeed greatly increase production. In 1957, he received 800 yuan and now he strives to do both heavy and hard work. He said that working in the agricultural cooperative is much better than earning 0.7 yuan a day in a shoe factory. He has become an active member of agricultural cooperative production labor.

    The fact that agricultural cooperatives have increased production has further reversed the thinking of valuing business over agriculture and preferring industry to agriculture. Many people have realized that agricultural production has great potential, which can not only increase income but also be more secure than engaging in business. Therefore, many people have examined their erroneous views, settled down to cooperative production labor, and established the idea of taking the cooperative as their home. Cheng Xiaosheng said: in the past, he "worked only in the well-worn field," but now that he has joined the cooperative, life is better; in order to do a good job in the cooperative, he is willing to endure more hardship!

    Li Xiaoqi, a member who had joined the cooperative in name only in the past, did not take care of the cooperative's property and often said: "There are so many people in the cooperative, it only costs a few cents if something is damaged or lost!" Now, he has raised his awareness of collectivism and is very concerned about and cherishes the cooperative's farm tools. He repairs them himself when they are broken and wipes them when they are rusty, just like he cherishes his own things.

    The members unanimously agreed to expand public accumulation, and a total of 13,000 yuan has been expanded in the past two years. Now, no one in the village wants to leave the agricultural cooperative anymore. They say: advanced cooperatives are treasure troves, and only by taking the road of cooperativization can we truly live a prosperous life.

    Wei Erxiao, who had firmly refused to join the cooperative in the past and was willing to engage in business as a small laborer, regretted it to death after seeing the fact that the cooperative had increased production, the members were living a prosperous life, and especially after seeing that his brother-in-law's income in the cooperative reached 1,000 yuan in 1957. He repeatedly went to the village secretary, Comrade Li Cong, to ask to join the cooperative.

    Branch Secretary Li Cong said: "Let anyone who says there is no future in engaging in agriculture come and see our village!" All the members of this cooperative are now carrying out a vigorous movement of accumulating fertilizer and managing wheat, and they are confidently expressing that the potential for production is still great, and a yield of 1,000 jin of grain per mu is by no means the peak, and they will strive for even greater goals in the future.

    把一亩地当作三亩地种
                  中共邢台地委书记　李吉平
    每人只有五分多地，收入也能超过富裕中农和商贩
    邢台地区1957年已经有了七个社亩产粮食千斤以上，还有一个社亩产皮棉三百八十斤。这里介绍一下其中的一个——邢台市南园村红光第一社。这个社1957年平均亩产一千多斤粮，一万七千斤菜。全社七十六户，三百一十七口人，每人平均只有土地五分五厘。解放前，全村六十四户就有五十三户是佃户，过着饥寒交迫的生活。群众用这样的歌谣诉说当时的生活：“紧干慢干，养着地主老板，一年又一年，年年受熬煎。”解放后实行了土改，虽然大部农民生活较前好转了，但财小力薄，少农具缺牲口，所耕种的土地粮菜产量提高有限，亩产一般是二百多斤，仍然不足维持生活。很多人认为土地少，经营农业生产没前途，不愿积极参加农业生产，他们说：“每人地半亩，产量六斗五，虽然翻了身，生活还是苦。”很多人仍然是依靠担担挑挑经营小商贩或到市内当小工或手工业工人来维持生活。1956年，这个村建立了农业合作社。合作化后第一年，粮食产量就提高到亩产六百零五斤，每个社员平均纯收入达到了一百一十二元。1957年在农业生产上大大跃进，粮食亩产量达到了一千一百一十二斤，蔬菜每亩收到一万七千五百五十三斤，全社总收入折款五万五千多元。扣除公粮及社内开支和公共积累以后，全社每人平均收入一百五十五元。因为农业生产收入增加了，社员不仅都摆脱了贫困，而且超过了过去富裕中农的生产和生活水平。1957年分配的结果，全社七十六户中，收入千元以上的四户，七百到一千元的二十五户，五百到七百元的十七户，二百到五百元的二十八户，收入一百元以上的二户（各一口人）。高级合作化前南园村拔尖的富裕中农李永祥、李占光、李伦三户的每人平均收入，都比不上现在社员每人平均收入。富裕中农李永祥，由于积极参加劳动，也比入社前增加了收入。在单干的时候，他全家四口人每人平均收入一百零四元六角；1957年三口人每人平均收入三百二十二元多。
    随着收入的增加，社员们生活也大大改善了。现在全村家家户户都有了蚊帐、花被、暖水瓶、膠鞋，很多人买了自行车、绒衣、盖了新房。1956年五十四户欠国家银行和信用社贷款五千元；1957年这些户不但全部偿还了贷款，而且全社还有70％的户向信用社存款六千元。宫新安过去是佃户，因为收入不能维持生活，带着女儿要饭；1957年两口人在社内分了六百多元，高兴得见人就说：“不是共产党和毛主席领导建立了高级社，可不能到今天这步田地！”五十六岁的老社员张荣说，合作化把他的穷命变成富命了。社员贾进福以前卖烟卷，现在参加社内劳动，一年作了三百零九点九个劳动日，每个劳动日值一元五角七分，已分得了款四百八十六元五角四分，两口人目前生活很富裕。贾洪彬没入社，每日推着小车卖货，一年只挣了三百六十元（十个月），全家四口人（妻和两个小孩），除了生活费用没有多少敷余。魏二小不愿在社干活，到市内当泥水工，每天只挣一元二角，一年平均只能劳动半年，一年只挣了二百多元，现在看到农业社员收入多，曾几次向社长检讨错误，要求重新入社。
    发挥了群众的积极性和创造性
            一亩地顶三亩种
    这个社的男女社员们，从去年开春到现在，每个人都是在忘我地劳动着。旁处的地种一季或二季，而他们社的地种三季、四季。别的社浇四水、五水，他们浇八水。其他社每亩地施肥料七千到一万斤，他们施二万到二万四千斤。这种生产劲头是从哪里来的呢？除了增产增收的事实激发了大家的积极性以外，开展了社会主义红旗竞赛起了不小的作用。他们把生产竞赛运动持续贯彻在全年的生产活动中。在生产竞赛中，注意了抓先进带动落后。如以先进的一队带动了二、三队，扭转了积肥和小麦管理进度迟缓的现象。支书李琮不但深入二队领导生产，而且以身作则带头参加了生产，只去年就做了三千多个工分。社长李忖经常深入生产队生产组，具体帮助各队解决问题，并不断地向社员进行社会主义教育。
    红光第一社的全体社员，在1957年的开始，响应党的“千方百计争取大丰收”的号召，在各个生产队展开了争取大丰收的献策献计活动。社员们在1956年的丰收鼓舞下，为了继续争取大丰收，每个人都积极地认真地从各方面考虑了各种增加生产的办法。他们首先根据本社的具体生产条件和特点进行了分析，认识到：在每人平均五分五厘土地上要想多收入，除了多施肥料、改良技术、合理浇水、精细管理提高单位产量外，唯一办法就是提高复种技术，提高土地复种率，“把一亩地当作三亩地种”。第二生产队队长李成彬并提出了他过去复种的经验，说明：我们只要掌握不同作物的生长期，采用间作、混作、轮作的办法，提高土地利用率，可以做到一亩顶三亩收，亩产千斤是完全可能的。
    管委会在领导生产上走群众路线，发挥了群众智慧，采纳了李成彬等人的意见。1957年，有的地一年种了四次或五次。全社有九十六亩地实行了粮、菜间作和轮作，使粮食作物播种面积达到了一百七十八亩，收粮七万一千五百二十九斤；粮食收获后又种菜八十七点六亩。这样，在这九十六亩地上，粮和菜就种到了二百六十五点六亩，复种率达到了276.6％。其中复种三次的七十三点六亩（一季小麦、一季谷子或玉米、一季白菜）；复种二次的二十二点四亩（小麦一季、山药或菜一季）。为什么能够达到这样高的复种率呢？首先是根据农作物的生长期的长短实行了粮菜间作。麦子、小白谷、玉米的生长期是六十五天到七十天，他们便把六十二点六亩地种了二季粮食一季菜，在小麦收割后又种了小白谷或玉米，等小白谷或玉米收割了后又种上白菜。其次，他们还在十二亩耕地上利用不同农作物的特点，采取了交叉复种的办法，种了八亩小麦和四亩北瓜；播种的办法是每隔二畦小麦种一畦北瓜。麦子到春天快熟了的时候，北瓜幼苗的生长不受妨碍；等到小麦收割的时候北瓜才串秧蔓。这样，这十二亩地就多种了八亩小麦；北瓜收了以后，又种上一季白菜。第三队还创造了在菜的空隙播种的办法。因为播种的幼苗需要养分少，在空隙里也能正常地生长；到它将要长成的时期，上茬作物就要成熟收割。第三队1957年春种了三亩小葱（窄畦），同时在葱的背垅上又种了“五月鲜”豆角；豆角还没收完，又在垅背上点种了玉米；玉米还没收，又在玉米垅里种了白菜。这样，就可以在三次播种的菜地里种一季粮食作物。他们还利用蔬菜的休闲时间种粮食作物。如在韭菜地内，当7月韭菜休闲时期种了玉米，玉米快要收获的时期又种了白菜。这样，每亩地就收了三百八十斤玉米、一万五千斤白菜。
    红光第一社的社员们发挥了积极性、创造性，在有限的土地上给社会主义贡献了多少东西！同时，全社农民的收入也就大大提高了。
    事实教育了弃农经商、喜工厌农的人们
    二年来的事实，教育了一些弃农从商和喜工厌农的人。在办社的第一年，很多人看不到农业生产上的潜力，他们认为土地少，就是再加工再增产也满足不了生活需要，于是很多社员不积极参加田间劳动，不遵守社的劳动纪律，随便出去做小商贩或跑到城市当工人。如青年社员程小生认为在合作社干农活吃苦没前途，不肯参加田间劳动，跑到市内鞋工厂去当工人，每天挣七角钱。贾忠祥不参加社内劳动而自己天天挑着担子卖菜，每天可以得到五角钱的收入。党支部为了办好农业社领导好生产，针对这种情况向全体社员进行了政治思想教育工作，制定了农业生产规划，向社员指出发展农业生产的前途，并且积极领导搞好社内生产，用社内增产增加收入的事实来教育社员。党支部号召全体党团员积极带头参加生产活动。过去不积极参加生产的程小生，看到农业社的确能大大增产就积极参加了劳动。1957年他分了八百元，现在不论活重活苦他都争着干。他说，在农业社劳动要比在鞋厂每天挣七角钱强多了。他已经变成农业社生产劳动的积极分子。
    农业社增产的事实，进一步扭转了重商轻农喜工厌农的思想。很多人认识了农业生产的潜力很大，不但可以增加收入，而且比搞商业有保障。因此，不少人都检查了自己的错误观点，安心于社内生产劳动，树立了以社为家的思想。程小生说：过去是“住了辘轳畦内干”，现在入了社，光景好了；为了把社搞好，多吃点苦也要干！
    社员李小齐过去入了社是身在社心不在社，对社的财产不加爱护，常说：“社内这么多人，坏点丢点东西搁在自己身上才有几个钱！”现在，提高了集体主义的觉悟，对社内农具非常关心爱护，坏了都是自己动手修理，农具生了锈自己擦，同爱护自己的东西一样。
    社员一致赞成扩大公共积累，两年来共扩大了一万三千元。现在，全村的人谁也不想再离开农业社了。他们说：高级社是聚宝盆，只有走合作化的道路才能真正过富裕生活的日子。
    过去坚决不入社愿搞商业当小工的魏二小，看到社里增产的事实、社员富裕的生活，特别是看到他姐夫在社内1957年收入达到了一千元，后悔得死去活来，接连几次找村支书李琮同志要求入社。
    支部书记李琮说：“谁说搞农业没有前途，就让他们到我们村里来看看！”这个社的全体社员们，现在正开展着热烈的积肥和小麦管理运动，他们并且满怀信心地表示：生产的潜力还很大，亩产千斤粮决不是顶点，今后还要向更远大的目标前进。
