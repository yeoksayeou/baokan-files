Several Ways to Cook Ribbonfish

Ribbonfish is a nutritious food. Every jin (500 grams) of ribbonfish contains 49.3 grams of protein, 10 grams of fat, and a relatively high content of minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, and iron.

This year, there has been a bumper harvest of ribbonfish in the coastal areas of Zhejiang, and it is currently being supplied in large quantities on the market at a relatively low price. Many families love to eat it.

Here are some simple cooking methods:

(1) Oil-free Braised Ribbonfish: One jin of ribbonfish, one spoonful of salt, a few peppercorns, 150 grams of vinegar, two and a half spoonfuls of soy sauce, two spoonfuls of sweet bean sauce, two spoonfuls of cooking wine, two or three sections of scallions, two slices of ginger, and four cloves of garlic. Method: First, wash the fish, remove the internal organs and head and tail, and cut the fish into sections about three inches long; then make two cuts and rub the salt and peppercorns on it, and soak it in vinegar for a few hours. When putting it on the heat, first scald the fish in boiling water to remove the silvery-white spots and reduce the fishy smell. Then put the scallions, ginger, garlic, and all the seasonings in a pot with water and boil. After the water boils, add the fish and boil it two or three times. Move it to a low heat and cook for five minutes (turning the fish once), then move it to a slightly higher heat and cook for two minutes, and the fish is cooked. It would be even better to sprinkle some green garlic shreds when serving.

(2) Dry-Fried Ribbonfish: One jin of fish, 50 grams of minced fatty and lean pork, 50 grams of diced carrots, 50 grams of diced bamboo shoots, 75 grams of vegetable oil, one spoonful of broad bean paste, half a spoonful of refined salt, one spoonful of cooking wine, and some minced scallions, ginger, and garlic. Method: First, clean the fish and fry both sides until golden brown in a wok with oil. Stir-fry the minced meat, diced carrots, etc., then add various seasonings, stir-fry a few times, add water, then add the fish pieces. After a few boils, simmer over low heat for five minutes, then use a slightly higher heat to reduce the sauce. Delicious dry-fried ribbonfish is ready.

(3) Sweet and Sour Ribbonfish: One jin of fish, 75 grams of vegetable oil, 75 grams of sugar, 100 grams of vinegar, one spoonful of salt, one spoonful of soy sauce, shredded scallions, ginger, minced garlic, and a little flour. Method: After cleaning the fish, cut it into three-inch-long pieces, marinate it with salt for two hours, coat it with a little flour, and fry it in a wok. First, fry for a few minutes over low heat, then fry the fish to a dark yellow color over high heat. Then skim off the oil, and add various seasonings, stir-fry two or three times, and the fish is cooked. The fish made in this way is delicious both hot and cold. (Zhang)

    带鱼的几种吃法
    带鱼是一种含营养素较丰富的食物。每斤（五百克）带鱼含蛋白质四十九点三克，脂肪十克，矿物质钙、磷、铁等的含量也较多。
    今年浙江沿海一带带鱼丰收，目前市场上正大量供应，价格也较便宜。很多人家都爱吃它。
    现在介绍几种简易烹调方法：
    （一）无油红烧带鱼　带鱼一斤，用盐一羹匙、花椒数粒、醋三两、酱油两羹匙半、甜面酱两羹匙、料酒两羹匙、葱二三段、姜两片、蒜四瓣。做法：先洗净鱼，去掉肚内肠腑和头尾，把鱼切成约三寸长的一段；再划二刀，把盐和花椒搓在上边，在醋里泡几小时。上火时，先把鱼在开水中烫一下，银白色小点可以去净，腥味也大减。然后把葱、姜、蒜和一切作料加清水放在锅里煮，水开后下鱼，煮二、三开，移至微火上煮五分钟（翻鱼一次），再移至稍大的火上煮二分钟，鱼就熟了。盛鱼时如撒些青蒜丝更好。
    （二）干烧带鱼　鱼一斤、肥瘦肉末一两、胡萝卜丁一两、兰片丁一两、植物油一两半、豆瓣酱一羹匙、精盐半羹匙、料酒一羹匙、葱姜蒜末各一些。做法：先把鱼收拾干净，放在油锅里把两面煎黄；把肉末、萝卜丁等边一下，随下各种作料，炒两三开，加清水，再下鱼段，几个开后，用微火靠五分钟，再用稍大火把烫收干。味美的干烧带鱼就做成了。
    （三）糖醋带鱼　鱼一斤、植物油一两半、糖一两五、醋二两、盐一羹匙、酱油一羹匙、葱、姜丝、蒜末、面粉少许。做法：鱼收拾后，切三寸长的鱼段，用盐腌二小时，沾一点面粉，下锅炸。先用微火炸几分钟，再用大火把鱼炸成深黄色，然后把油撇出，随烹各种作料，炒两三下，鱼就熟了。这样做出的鱼，热吃冷吃都好。（章）
