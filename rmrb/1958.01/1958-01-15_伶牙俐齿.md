    Eloquent and Sharp-tongued

    That humans are the most intelligent of all creatures is partly evidenced by our teeth.

    Originally, teeth evolved, developed, and eventually differentiated as chewing organs alongside the evolution of organisms. Invertebrates generally do not have true teeth. Vertebrates developed special structures on their jawbones to crush food, and these are teeth. Teeth, like claws, nails, and hair, develop from the epidermis of the skin.

    Among vertebrates, fish came first, followed by amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, evolving in sequence, each class more advanced than the last. The history of teeth began with fish, of course, the shape at that time being extremely simple. Thereafter, except for birds, all kinds of animals developed this structure, and it gradually became more perfect and ideal. Birds once had teeth in ancient times, but unfortunately, they degenerated and disappeared later.

    In mammals, the differentiation of teeth is greater. They not only vary in shape but also have different functions such as tools, weapons, and chewing. For example, rabbits and rodents have incisors like shovels that can be used to dig nests; cats and dogs have canines like knives and swords for tearing; elephants have tusks for stabbing; snakes have venomous fangs for injecting venom; horses and cows have molars like grinders for finely grinding food; and so on.

    As for humans, we have two sets of teeth in our lifetime. The first set of twenty teeth is called deciduous teeth, which are the teeth of the "still wet behind the ears" period. We begin to grow them six or seven months after entering the world, growing about four every four months, and they are all grown in by about one and a half years old. The second set of thirty-two teeth is called permanent teeth, indicating that these teeth are more permanent. They begin to appear when we are six or seven years old, replacing the old with the new, and are all replaced by about twenty years old. Among them, the last four wisdom teeth are said to grow only when we reach the age of wisdom. However, some people don't grow them until they are thirty or forty years old, which does not necessarily mean they are late bloomers.

    The function of human teeth is primarily chewing. As soon as food enters the mouth, the eight incisors cut it off; the four canines and eight premolars further tear and crush it; and the twelve molars finally grind it finely, completing the great task of the teeth. See, what a sophisticated set of machinery! This machine is the first gateway for the human body to digest food. If it is damaged, the food will be swallowed whole into the stomach, which over time will injure the gastric mucosa, inevitably leading to stomach problems.

    Human teeth also have the function of assisting in pronunciation. We often praise a young person who speaks well as "eloquent and sharp-tongued." Indeed, many sounds are difficult to pronounce correctly if the teeth do not help the lips, tongue, and cheeks to move together. For example, just the word "齿" (chǐ, tooth) itself, the sound comes from within the throat, and it is only through the movement of the tongue and teeth that it can be accurately "齿" (chǐ) out. No wonder some elderly people speak unclearly, it is because they have lost teeth and are letting air escape.

    Emotional excitement, especially during resentment, often seems to require the assistance of teeth to express or suppress it. For example, some people are so angry that they "gnash their teeth," some "itch to tear someone apart," and some "clench their teeth" and endure it, and so on.

    On the human face, teeth are not among the five sense organs, but they equally affect whether the appearance is proper or not. Don't we have adjectives like "red lips and white teeth" and "bright eyes and white teeth"? Former writers were even more fond of using it to describe the beauty of a beautiful woman, such as the Northern Song poet Zhang Xian, who had famous lines such as "icy teeth reflect light lips" and "goose teeth bridge red." Indeed, if a person has a set of neat and white teeth, it can add color to their appearance.

    The teeth of human beings have grown so completely and play such wonderful roles as mentioned above, which is beyond the reach of all kinds of animals. But human teeth (plus jawbones) are gradually degenerating because human hands and brains have developed and can replace them as tools and weapons, and even the function of chewing. This is precisely the inevitable trend after human beings have broken away from animal life.

    伶牙俐齿

    人类之为万物之灵，牙齿也是一个证明。
    原来牙齿是作为咀嚼器官，才随着生物的进化而发生、发展、最后又分化起来的。无脊椎动物一般都没有真正的牙齿。有脊椎动物为了咬碎食物，颚骨上有了一些特别的装置，这就是牙齿。牙齿同爪甲、毛发一样，是皮肤的外表物发育成的。
    就有脊椎动物来讲，先有鱼类，以后两栖类、爬虫类、鸟类、哺乳类，顺次进化，一类比一类高明。牙齿的历史是同鱼类一起开始的，当然，那时的形状极为简单。这以后，除鸟类外，各类动物都有了这种发育，并且也随着日趋完善、理想。鸟类也曾经一度有过牙齿，那是在最古的时候，可惜后来又退化消失了。
    到哺乳类，牙齿的分化就大了。不仅形状各异，而且各具工具、武器、咀嚼等不同的功用。例如兔、鼠有着铲子似的可以用来掘巢的门牙；猫、狗有着刀、剑一样用来撕裂的尖牙；象有着刺戳之用的长牙；蛇有着注射毒液的毒牙；马、牛有磨子一般细磨食物的后牙；等等。
    至于人，人一生共有两副牙齿。第一副二十个，叫乳牙，是“乳臭未干”时期的牙齿。人从入世后六、七个月开始长它，大约每隔四个月长四个，到一岁半左右长齐。第二副三十二个，叫恒牙，表明这副牙齿比较恒久的意思。它在人六、七岁时开始出现，以新换旧，到二十岁左右换齐。其中最后四个尽头牙，又叫智牙，是说人到智慧时期才生它的意思。可是有人晚到三、四十岁才生，未必便是大器晚成的人。
    人牙的作用，首先在于咀嚼。食物一进口，八个门牙就来切断它；四个犬牙和八个前磨牙进一步撕裂和捣碎它；十二个臼齿最后把它磨细，牙齿的大功于是告成。你看，多么精细的一套机器！这部机器是人体消化食物的第一道关口，要是坏了，食物被囫囵吞枣地吞到胃里，久了会使胃黏膜受伤，不免要生胃病。
    人的牙齿，还有帮助发音的作用。哪个青年会说话，我们往往称赞说“伶牙俐齿”。的确，很多字音，如果牙齿不来帮着唇、舌、颊一起动作，是很难正确发音的。例如就这“齿”字，声音从喉内发出，靠了舌头和牙齿的动作，才能确切地“齿”出来。怪不得有些老年人讲话口齿不清，是掉了牙漏了风的缘故。
    感情激动，特别是在愤恨的时候，似乎也常要借牙齿一把劲，才能表达出来或抑止下去。例如有人怒得“咬牙切齿”，有人“恨得牙痒痒的”，有人又“咬紧牙关”忍耐下去，等等。
    在人脸上，牙齿是不在五官之列的，却同样影响着容貌的端正与否。不见“唇红齿白”“明眸皓齿”一类的形容词吗？从前的文学家，更喜欢用它来描写美人之美，如北宋诗人张先就有“冰齿映轻唇”、“雁齿桥红”等名句。确实，人若有一副整齐洁白的牙齿，是能给容貌增色。
    人类的牙齿长得如此完备，又起着上述一些奇妙的作用，是各类动物所望尘莫及的。但人类的牙齿（还加上颚骨）却正在渐渐退化，因为人的手、脑发达了起来，可以代替它们作为工具和武器的功用，甚至咀嚼的功用，这也正是人类摆脱了动物的生涯以后必然的趋势。
