Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: The Indonesian cabinet stated in a report to the Indonesian parliament that the one hundred million U.S. dollar loan promised by the Soviet Union to Indonesia will be beneficial to Indonesia's construction. The cooperation method and loan conditions between Indonesia and the Soviet Union are formulated on an equal footing.

The report stated that the Soviet loan is a long-term loan for ten years with very low interest rates. Moreover, considering the quality and price of the means of production supplied through the loan, it is beneficial to Indonesia's construction.

The report stated that the implementation of the agreement on Soviet loans to Indonesia will help ease the domestic situation because developing domestic construction can greatly overcome the instability facing Indonesia.

The report also stated that accepting Soviet loans is also an expression of implementing an independent policy. Indonesia has already accepted loans from the United States, West Germany, France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic.

The Soviet Union and Indonesia signed an agreement on technical and economic assistance on September 15, 1956, which stipulated granting Indonesia a loan of one hundred million U.S. dollars. The agreement has been approved by the Indonesian cabinet but has not yet been approved by the Indonesian parliament.

    印度尼西亚内阁向国会报告
    苏联贷款有利于建设
    新华社14日讯　印度尼西亚内阁在一项给印度尼西亚国会的报告书中说，苏联答应贷给印度尼西亚的一亿美元贷款将有利于印度尼西亚的建设。印度尼西亚和苏联之间的合作方式和贷款的条件都是在平等的基础上制订的。
    报告书说，苏联的贷款是为时十年的长期贷款，利息很低，而且从通过贷款供应的生产资料的质量和价格来看，都是有利于印度尼西亚的建设的。
    报告书说，执行苏联对印度尼西亚贷款的协定，将有助于缓和国内局势，因为通过发展国内建设事业可以大大地克服印度尼西亚所面对着的不稳定状态。
    报告书还说，接受苏联的贷款，也是实行独立政策的一种表示，印度尼西亚已经接受过美国、西德、法国、意大利、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国的贷款。
    苏联同印度尼西亚在1956年9月15日签订了一项关于技术和经济援助的协定，这项协定规定给予印度尼西亚贷款一亿美元。协定已经得到印度尼西亚内阁的批准，但是还没有得到印度尼西亚国会的批准。
