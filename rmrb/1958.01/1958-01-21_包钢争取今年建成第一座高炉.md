    Baotou Steel Strives to Complete First Blast Furnace This Year
    (Our report) According to the Inner Mongolia Daily, the Baotou Steel General Company is actively carrying out construction preparation work, striving to build the first blast furnace this year and complete various projects supporting the blast furnace construction.
    This year is the first year that Baotou Steel's construction enters its peak, with heavy tasks and a workload more than double that of last year. Important projects such as iron smelting, coking, and mineral processing will all begin construction this year. On the 4th of this month, the General Company convened a meeting of responsible cadres from various engineering companies and business divisions to deploy the overall progress of various projects, requiring all units to formulate annual work plans based on the arrangement of overall tasks.
    In the annual task arrangement, the General Company has set specific requirements for the drawing submission dates of various engineering designs. To ensure the progress of the designs, it has decided to transfer the design personnel involved in projects such as mines, coking, and refractory materials to work in Baotou in order to collect information and strengthen cooperation with other departments. For foreign design components, it is prepared to adopt a system of sending people abroad to establish direct contact, striving for early drawing delivery or more understanding of the situation, to create conditions for early project commencement.
    Since October last year, the company has begun to work on the construction organization design for this year's projects, allocating construction machinery and various building materials. At present, 65% of the construction machinery has been resolved. A portion of the steel, cement, and wood needed for the first half of the year has been prepared, and local building materials such as bricks, tiles, sand, and stone can basically meet construction needs. Some of the construction base projects serving the construction are coming to an end; the electrical and pipeline processing plant and the second metal structure plant, which are planned to be built this year, will commence construction in the first quarter.
    In the first quarter of this year, the entire company plans to complete 13% of the annual task.

    包钢争取今年建成第一座高炉
    本报讯　据内蒙古日报报道：包钢总公司正在积极进行施工准备工作，争取在今年内建设起第一座高炉，并完成配合高炉施工的各项工程。
    今年是包钢建设进入高峰的第一年，任务很大，工作量比去年增加一倍多。炼铁、焦化、选矿等重要工程都将在今年开始施工。本月4日，总公司即召集各工程公司和业务处的负责干部开会，部署了各项工程的总进度，要求各单位根据全面任务的安排订出全年工作规划。
    总公司在全年任务的安排中，对各项工程设计的交图日期都订出了具体的要求；为了保证设计进度，决定把有关矿山、焦化、耐火材料等工程的设计人员调到包头工作，以便搜集资料，加强和其他部门的协作。对于国外设计部分，准备采取派人去国外，建立直接联系制度，争取早出图或多了解情况，为工程提前开工创造条件。
    从去年10月，这个公司就开始做今年工程的施工组织设计，调拨施工机械和各种建筑材料。目前，施工机械65％已经解决。上半年需用的钢材、水泥、木材已有一部分备妥，砖、瓦、砂、石等地方建筑材料基本上已能满足施工需要。为施工服务的建筑基地的一些工程正在进行结尾；今年计划兴建的电气和管道加工厂、第二座金属结构厂都将在第一季度动工。
    今年第一季度，全公司计划完成全年任务的13％。
