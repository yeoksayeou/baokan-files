    Vanity and Dependency Thinking at Work
    I am a graduate student, and my monthly allowance is 57.65 yuan. After deducting 15 yuan for family expenses, even spending all the rest is not enough. I always have to borrow some money to buy meal tickets to get through the last few days. Although I wanted to save money a long time ago, I haven't saved a single yuan so far. It's not that I'm a glutton or like to dress up. I haven't bought any new clothes or shoes, nor have I purchased any books for a long time. I don't drink or smoke either. Where does my money go?
    After seeing the discussion on "Is This Wasteful?", I examined myself and suddenly realized the truth. It turns out that deep down, I have the bad habits of the bourgeoisie, such as being vain and showing off, as well as the dependency thinking of relying on the organization to solve problems. Therefore, I spend money arbitrarily in my daily life. I like to socialize. Socializing doesn't have to cost money, or at least it doesn't have to cost much, but I feel that not spending money would hurt my "face." So, whenever I visit someone, I have to buy some candy or toys for their children. Every year, I go home twice, and each time I spend more than 30 yuan on gifts for relatives and friends in both places. When I write to comrades and classmates, I always attach some small gifts to express my feelings, and I write so many letters that postage alone costs me about six yuan a month. See, that's how I end up being financially strained every month.
    I now regret it and am determined to correct myself.

    是虚荣心和依赖思想作祟
    我是研究生，每月助学金五十七元六角五分，除开家庭负担十五元，全部花光还不够用，最后几天总还要借些钱来买饭票才能度过。虽然很久以前我就想储蓄，但到现在为止，一元钱也没有储成。并不是我好吃好穿，我已经很久没有添置穿戴、没有购买书籍了，我也不喝酒，不抽烟。我的钱都用在哪儿呢？
    看到“这是浪费吗”的讨论，我检查了我自己，才恍然大悟。原来，在我的思想深处有着资产阶级好虚荣、讲排场的恶习，也有着有困难找组织解决的依赖思想。所以，我日常用钱就任意挥霍。我喜欢交往。交往本不用花钱，至少不必多花钱，但我觉得不花钱有碍“面子”。于是，每当去人家作客，我就非给人家孩子买些糖果、玩具不可。每年回两次家，每次给两地亲戚朋友带的礼品就有三十多元。给同志、同学们写信，我也总要附些小礼品聊表心意，信又那么多，一个月光邮费就得花上六元钱左右。看吧，就这样，把我弄得月月紧张。
    我现在悔悟了，决心改正。
