    New Ways to Conserve
    Jing Yu
    The National Brick and Tile Industry Technical Exchange Conference, which closed in Beijing on the 20th, reached a conclusion on technical issues: old technologies conceal huge waste, and new technologies have amazing conservation potential. It is gratifying that the fire of anti-waste has spread to the industrial technology sector. It is gratifying because the anti-waste movement in the technical field can not only save wealth but is also related to technological innovation and the promotion of production.
    According to the research of the National Brick and Tile Industry Technical Exchange Conference: using lime-sand bricks and lime-slag bricks instead of clay for production has six major advantages. Saving land alone can save more than 26,000 mu of arable land a year, which can increase grain production by more than 13 million jin.
    Another message from the Ministry of Railways about the trial laying of reinforced concrete sleepers to replace wooden sleepers reflects that if this kind of sleeper is promoted in railway construction, it can save a lot of timber, reduce maintenance costs, and extend the service life by 50 to 70 years.
    It can be seen that technical innovation is an important subject for the technical community to implement the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results. If the national technical community, in the special forum on anti-waste, replaces backward and conservative production technologies with advanced production technologies that are in line with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results, according to the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, then we can not only save a lot of wealth, but also greatly promote the improvement of production.
    However, it should be noted that there are still such conservatives in our ranks who have lost their sensitivity to new things and do not pay attention to the promotion of new technologies. They are worried, have many concerns, one-sidedly emphasize difficulties, are accustomed to doing things in the old way, and do not actively try to improve old production technologies. Some people stubbornly refuse to change the existing technical situation, and they swear and curse: saying that if this thing succeeds, I will not be surnamed Zhang; if that thing is done, I will not be surnamed Li. It can be seen that the force of habitual conservatism is a stubborn force, and the growth of new things is bound to have a process of struggle.
    The fire of anti-waste has sparked the seeds of technical innovation. Let us all actively improve old technologies and promote new technologies!

    节约的新途径
    静宇
    20日在北京闭幕的全国砖瓦工业技术交流会议上，在技术问题方面得出了一个结论：旧技术掩盖着巨大的浪费，新技术有着惊人的节约潜力。反浪费的火烧到工业技术界是一件可喜的事情。说它可喜，就是技术界的反浪费，不只是可以节约财富，而且是和革新技术、促进生产相关联的。
    据全国砖瓦工业技术交流会议研究：不用粘土生产灰砂砖和灰渣砖，有六大好处，只节省土地一项，一年可以节省可耕土地两万六千多亩，可增加粮食一千三百多万斤。
    另据铁道部试铺钢筋水泥轨枕代替枕木的消息反映，在铁路建设中如果推广这种轨枕，可以节约大量木材，减少维护费用，延长使用年限达五十年到七十年。
    可见，技术革新是技术界贯彻多快好省的重要课题，如果全国技术界在反浪费的专题鸣放中，根据勤俭建国的方针把落后的保守的生产技术代之以先进的合乎多快好省的生产技术，那么，我们就可以一方面节约大量财富，一方面又可以大大促进生产的提高。
    然而要注意到在我们的队伍中，也还有这样的保守派，他们失去了对新鲜事物的敏感，不重视新技术的推行。他们忧心忡忡，顾虑多端，片面地强调困难，习惯于按老样子办事，不积极想办法去改进旧的生产技术。也有人顽固地拒绝改变现有技术状况，他们发誓赌咒：说什么这桩事情试成了我不姓张，那桩事情办成了我不姓李。可见习惯的守旧的力量是一股顽强的力量，新事物的生长必然要有一番斗争的过程。
    反浪费的火，引出了技术革新的苗头。让我们大家都来积极改进旧技术、推行新技术！
