The report by Comrade Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered at the Shanghai Municipal Party Congress, published in this newspaper the day before yesterday, is an important document full of revolutionary spirit and worthy of serious reading. The report devoted considerable space to analyzing the criticisms of the Party made by the masses and pointed out methods for overcoming shortcomings in work, organization, and style. When discussing the issue of the work style of Party leading cadres, Comrade Ke Qingshi pointed out that this was the most concentrated and prominent aspect of the opinions raised by the masses during the great blooming and contending. He said: "The issue of leadership style is mainly a matter of the relationship between some Party leading cadres and the masses. The opinions of the masses on leadership style actually reflect their dissatisfaction with the ‘official air’ of some Party leading cadres who are detached from the masses to varying degrees. This rectification should first and foremost thoroughly eliminate this ‘official air.’" This is well said. We now want to offer some opinions specifically on this issue.

For Communists and all revolutionary workers who have seized national power, what is the most dangerous enemy? The Kuomintang reactionaries have already been driven out of the mainland, and American imperialism has also been confronted on the Korean battlefield. The landlord class has been eliminated as a class, and the bourgeoisie has been basically eliminated as a class. Bourgeois elements are being reformed, and the facts of the past year have proven that they cannot rebel: the majority of them are willing to accept socialism, and the few who oppose socialism are isolated among the masses. So, for us, what is the most dangerous enemy? The most dangerous enemy is the style of being detached from the masses, which is what Comrade Ke Qingshi referred to in his report as "official air." Chairman Mao has repeatedly warned us. In "On Coalition Government," he said, "Every comrade should be made to understand that as long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses is inexhaustible, and therefore trust the people and become one with them, then any difficulty can be overcome, and any enemy cannot overwhelm us, but will be overwhelmed by us." The people are the true creators of history. The reason why all kinds of reactionary forces cannot escape defeat in the face of the revolutionary movement is that they are completely detached from the masses. The most fundamental reason why we Communists have been able to defeat all enemies and achieve revolutionary victory is that we rely on the people and have won their support. The people are the inexhaustible source of power for us to overcome all kinds of difficulties. Together with the people, we have overthrown the rulers of the old era—all kinds of "officials" who rode roughshod over the people. But the garbage of history is not easily cleared away. The bad habits of the old bureaucrats, like flies, still fly around the revolutionary ranks, looking for gaps to lay their eggs. And once we are captured by this official air and detached from the masses, we will lose all our abilities, like fish out of water. Therefore, our entire Party must concentrate its efforts during the rectification process to eliminate this official air that harms our connection with the masses.

We Communists are not anarchists. We believe that the state and government are necessary until classes are eliminated throughout the world. Therefore, a certain number of state workers holding certain positions, including leaders, are necessary. Without leaders, the masses would be a disorganized mess, and the great power of the people would be impossible to unleash. But we believe that no state worker, including leaders, should therefore become an official, an official who rides roughshod over the people, an official who is detached from the masses. This kind of official is a bureaucrat of the reactionary ruling class, oppressing the people is their profession, and detachment from the masses is their nature. This kind of bureaucrat is absolutely incompatible with our socialist cause and with the basic conditions that a Communist Party member should possess. For us Communists, being an "official" can only be synonymous with serving the people. Being an "official" or not being an "official," doing leadership work or doing other work, are only differences in the division of labor in society. Doing leadership work only means having more obligations to the Party and the people than ordinary people, the obligation to do a better job of revolutionary work within the scope of one's responsibilities, and absolutely does not mean enjoying privileges.

It is a sign of the great victory of the people's revolution that the vanguard of the proletariat—Communist Party members—and the broad masses of workers and revolutionaries have risen to leading positions in our country. From American imperialists to China's bourgeois rightists, all oppose this, but the vast majority of the people across the country support it. In our country, the majority of state workers are connected with the masses, are wholeheartedly serving the people, and are diligent, honest, and hard-working. It is precisely because they have fought heroically with the people of the whole country that our People's Republic has achieved such astonishing progress in just eight years. But it must be seen that there are also some people who treat revolution as a way to become officials, or who want to both make revolution and be officials. They are infected with official air, regard themselves as special, superior to others, have no regard for the masses, and put on official airs. They regard revolutionary work merely as writing documents, making decisions, and issuing instructions, going from their dormitories to the office when they go to work, and from the office to their dormitories when they leave work. No wind can blow them to factories, construction sites, rural areas, schools, or companies, and even when they get there, when they see the masses, they "have iron faces, put their hands in their pockets, and don't even smile," arrogant and full of official airs. They neither understand nor care about what changes are taking place below or what opinions the masses have. This style of being detached from the masses is not the style of a Communist Party member, nor is it the style of a revolutionary state worker. Although the number of people in our ranks who are seriously afflicted with this problem is very small, at most only one finger out of ten, we must not generalize, and like the rightists say that the entire Communist Party and the People's Government are bureaucratized, but the disease of bureaucracy is undoubtedly a serious, stubborn, and contagious disease, and we must fight it with great effort. One of the main purposes of our Party's launching of the mass rectification movement is to rely on the power of the masses to carry out this struggle.

History is created by the masses. Any great person is like a drop in the ocean compared to the masses. Our cadres, even if they have made great contributions, are absolutely not worth boasting about—such boasting will not only not bring any glory, but will only become a shame for revolutionaries. Our leading workers should and must treat everyone other than enemies with an equal attitude. We should regard ourselves as ordinary workers and ordinary farmers, and associate with workers, farmers, and other working people, and not be allowed to put on any official airs.

We have pointed out many times that in socialist society, the superstructure will still conflict with the economic base, and this conflict often manifests itself as the contradiction between the leadership and the led. Leading cadres in various positions, if they do not increase their vigilance against the encroachment of the bureaucratic habits of the old society, if they do not strive to break old conventions and habits, earnestly strengthen their ties with the masses, and prevent the danger of detachment from the masses that may arise from their working conditions, they may develop official air at any time. The emergence of official air is mainly due to the influence of the ideological consciousness of the exploiting classes under the current conditions, but in some other cases, it may also be caused by errors in the ideological methods and working methods of the leading workers. In socialist society and even in future communist society, the contradiction between the leadership and the led will exist for a long time. When this contradiction is resolved, that contradiction will arise again, requiring constant adjustment and resolution. Therefore, the struggle against bureaucracy is a long-term struggle. However, as long as we take systematic measures to oppose official air, such as rectification movements, great blooming and contending, thorough criticism of bureaucracy, promotion of the mass line in all aspects, sending cadres down to lower levels and conducting labor training, having leading cadres participate in physical labor, and regularly going to factories and rural areas to conduct experimental fields, etc., we will be able to eliminate official air in the main aspects and reduce the harm of bureaucracy to the lowest limit.

The contradiction between the leadership and the led is a contradiction within the people, and it must be handled in a democratic and persuasive manner, and not in the manner of treating enemies and using suppression. Many state workers are still reluctant to part with official air, one of the reasons is that they do not understand that in our country, the exploiting classes have been basically eliminated, and the state power must resolutely implement dictatorship over anti-socialist elements and various criminal offenders, and only democracy can be implemented for the broad masses of the people, not dictatorship, and only persuasion can be used, not suppression. The method of great blooming and contending widely adopted in this rectification movement is the method of persuasion, which is a new development of the Party's mass line working method. In order to correctly handle the contradictions within the people, it is necessary to eliminate official air, oppose coercion and commandism, develop democratic life, and adhere to the method of persuasion rather than suppression.

Our country is currently in an era of great change. After the completion of the three major transformations of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in our country, the relations of production have changed, and the productive forces have been liberated. Since the rectification movement, the enthusiasm and creativity of the people in building socialism have been unprecedentedly high, reflecting the vigorous and vigorous vitality of our socialist system, and also indicating that our socialist cause is in the midst of a great leap forward. The broad masses of workers and peasants are demonstrating this earth-shaking change with their own practical actions. Many of our leading cadres do not yet have sufficient understanding of this new situation. At present, in the formulation of plans in various industrial and mining enterprises and in the winter production movement in rural areas, the phenomenon of leadership lagging behind the masses is very common. At this moment, it is even more urgent and easier to see results to eliminate official air than usual. The great task placed before the leading workers in various positions is to resolutely carry out the rectification movement to the end, bravely accept all correct criticisms from the masses, eliminate all official air with the momentum of riding the wind and breaking the waves, put down all official airs, break all systems that promote official air, walk out of the office, go among the masses, make friends with workers, peasants, and intellectuals, talk to them heart to heart, mobilize all the enthusiasm of the people, and strive to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically. In the past years of revolutionary war and land reform, many of our comrades went deep into the lower levels, shared weal and woe with the people, and shared their joys and sorrows, thus achieving great victories. Now the situation is even more favorable for us, and our task is even more arduous. The entire Party should muster its energy, eliminate official air, seek truth from facts, become one with the people, and overcome all shortcomings and errors in style, work, and system. All revolutionary patriots should inherit our glorious revolutionary traditions, carry forward vigor, sweep away dullness, go deep among the masses, go deep into reality, and lead our country's socialist construction to a new upsurge.

    打掉官气　
    前天本报发表的中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施同志在中共上海市代表大会上的报告，是一篇充满革命精神、值得认真阅读的重要文件。这个报告用了比较大的篇幅详细地分析了群众对党的批评，并且指出了克服工作上、组织上和作风上的缺点的方法。柯庆施同志在谈到党员领导干部的作风问题的时候，指出这是群众在大鸣大放中所提的意见的最集中、最特出的方面。他说：“领导作风问题，主要是一部分党员领导干部同群众的关系问题。群众对领导作风的意见，实际上反映了他们对一部分党员领导干部在不同程度上脱离群众的‘官气’的不满。这次整改，首先就要狠狠地整掉这种‘官气’。”这一段话说得很好。我们现在想专就这个问题说一些意见。
    对于掌握了全国政权的共产党人和一切革命工作人员来说，什么是最危险的敌人呢？国民党反动派已经被赶出大陆了，美帝国主义也在朝鲜战场上较量过了。地主作为一个阶级来说已经被消灭，资产阶级作为一个阶级来说基本上也已经被消灭。资产阶级分子正被改造中，过去一年的事实证明他们造不了反：他们中间的多数愿意接受社会主义，少数反对社会主义的在群众中陷于孤立地位。那么，对于我们，究竟什么是最危险的敌人呢？最危险的敌人就是脱离群众的作风，也就是柯庆施同志在报告中所说的“官气”。毛主席曾经一再告诫我们。他在“论联合政府”中说，“应该使每一个同志懂得，只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒”。人民群众是历史的真正创造者。各种反动力量在革命运动面前之所以不能免于败亡，就是因为他们彻底地脱离了群众。而我们共产党人之所以能够战胜一切敌人，取得了革命的胜利，最根本的原因就是我们依靠人民群众并且得到了他们的拥护。人民群众是我们克服各种困难的无穷无尽的力量的源泉。我们同人民群众在一起，已经推翻了旧时代的统治者——各式各样的骑在人民头上作威作福的“官”。但是历史的垃圾并不容易就此铲除干净。旧官僚的恶习气好像苍蝇一般，还在革命队伍旁边飞来飞去，寻找可以产卵的缝隙。而我们一旦被这种官气所俘虏，脱离了群众，我们就会像鱼离开了水一样，丧失了一切能力。因此，我们全党在整改过程中必须集中力量，打掉这种危害我们同群众的联系的官气。
    我们共产党人不是无政府主义者，我们认为国家和政府在全世界消灭了阶级以前是必要的。因此，一定数量的担任一定职务的国家工作人员，包括领导人员，是必要的。只有群众，没有领导者，一盘散沙，群龙无首，人民的伟大力量就将无从发挥。但是我们认为，任何国家工作人员，包括领导人员，决不应该因此而做官，做骑在人民头上的官，做脱离群众的官。这种官是反动统治阶级的官僚，压迫人民是他们的职业，脱离群众是他们的本性。这种官僚同我们的社会主义事业，同共产党员应该具备的起码的条件绝对不相容。对于我们共产党人来说，做“官”只能是为人民服务的同义语。做“官”和不做“官”，做领导工作和做其他工作，只是社会分工的差别。做领导工作，仅仅意味着对党、对人民负有比一般人更多的义务，把职责范围内的革命工作做得更好的义务，而绝对不是享有特权。
    使无产阶级的先锋队——共产党员和广大劳动者、革命者升到我们国家的领导地位，这是人民革命伟大胜利的标志。从美帝国主义者到中国的资产阶级右派都反对这一件事，但是全国最大多数的人民却都拥护这一件事。在我们的国家里，大多数国家工作人员是联系群众的，是忠心耿耿地为人民服务的，是勤劳、廉洁、艰苦朴素的，正是由于他们同全国人民一起英勇奋斗，我们的人民共和国才能在短短八年间获得如此惊人的进步。但是必须看到，也有一些这样的人，他们把革命当官做，或者又要革命、又要做官。他们沾染了官气，自视特殊，高人一等，目无群众，摆官架子。他们把革命工作仅仅看作是办公文、做决定、发指示，上班从宿舍到办公室，下班从办公室到宿舍。无论什么风，也难得把他们吹到工厂、工地、农村、学校、连队中去，即使到了那里，见了群众，也“铁板着面孔，两只手插在裤袋里，笑也不笑一下”，盛气凌人，官架子十足。下面的情况有什么变化，群众有什么意见，他们既不了解，也不关心。这种脱离群众的作风，不是共产党员的作风，不是革命的国家工作人员的作风。虽然很严重地害这种毛病的人在我们的队伍中为数很少，至多在十个指头中只占一个指头，我们决不可以以偏概全，像右派分子似的说什么整个共产党和人民政府都官僚化，但是官僚主义的毛病无疑是一种严重的顽固的富有传染性的病症，我们必须用极大的努力来同它作斗争。我们党之所以要发动群众进行整风运动，主要目的之一正是要依靠群众的力量来进行这个斗争。
    历史是群众创造的，任何伟大人物，比之于群众，有如沧海一粟。我们的干部，即便是有汗马功劳，也决然值不得夸耀——这种夸耀不但不能生出任何光荣，而且只能成为革命者的羞耻。我们的领导工作人员，应该而且必须以平等的态度对待除敌人以外的一切人。我们应该把自己当作一个普通工人、普通农民一样，去同工人、农民和其他劳动人民接触，不允许摆任何官架子。
    我们曾经多次指出：在社会主义社会中，上层建筑仍然会同经济基础发生矛盾，并且这种矛盾常常表现为领导和被领导的矛盾。各个岗位上的领导干部，如果不提高自己对于旧社会的官僚习气侵袭的警惕性，如果不努力打破陈规积习，认真加强自己同群众的联系，防止由于自己的工作条件可能产生脱离群众的危险，就随时可能产生官气。官气的产生在目前的条件下固然主要是由于剥削阶级思想意识的影响，但是在另外一些情况下也可能因领导工作人员的思想方法工作方法的错误而产生。在社会主义社会以至将来的共产主义社会中，领导和被领导的矛盾是会长期存在的，这方面的矛盾解决了，那一方面的矛盾又会产生，需要不断的调整和解决。因此，反对官僚主义的斗争是一个长时期的斗争。但是，只要我们采取有系统的反对官气的措施，例如整风运动、大鸣大放、对官僚主义进行彻底批判、在一切方面提倡群众路线、干部下放和进行劳动锻炼、领导干部参加体力劳动、定期下厂下乡和搞试验田等等，我们就有可能在主要的方面打掉官气，使官僚主义的危害缩小到最低限度。
    领导和被领导的矛盾，是属于人民内部的矛盾，必须用民主的、说服的方法去处理，而不能用对待敌人的、压服的方法去处理。许多国家工作人员对于官气还恋恋不舍，原因之一就在于他们不了解，我国目前已基本上消灭了剥削阶级，国家权力对反社会主义分子以及各种刑事罪犯必须坚决实行专政，对广大人民群众，只能实行民主，不能实行专政，只能说服，不能压服。这次整风运动中普遍采取的大鸣大放大争大辩的办法，就是说服的办法，就是党的群众路线的工作方法的一种新发展。为了正确处理人民内部的矛盾，必须打掉官气，反对强迫命令，开展民主生活，坚持说服的而不是压服的办法。
    我国目前正处在伟大变革的时代。我国的农业、手工业、资本主义工商业三大改造完成以后，生产关系改变了，生产力解放了。整风运动以来，人民群众建设社会主义的积极性和创造性空前高涨，反映了我国社会主义制度的旺盛的蓬勃的生命力，也表明了我国的社会主义事业正在大跃进中。广大的工人、农民正以自己的实际行动表明了这种翻天复地的大变化。对于这种新的形势，我们许多领导干部还没有足够的认识。目前各地工矿企业制订计划和农村冬季大生产运动中，领导落后于群众的现象是很多的。在这个时机，打掉官气更有迫切的必要，也比平时更易于见效。放在各个岗位的领导工作人员面前的伟大任务，就是坚决把整风运动进行到底，勇敢地接受群众一切正确的批评，以乘风破浪之势，打掉一切官气，放下一切官架子，打破一切助长官气的制度，走出办公室，走到群众中间，同工人、农民、知识分子交朋友、谈心事，把人民群众的积极性统统调动起来，一切为着又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义而奋斗。在过去的革命战争和土地改革的年代里，我们许多同志深入下层，同人民群众共患难、同呼吸，因而取得了伟大的胜利。现在形势对我们更有利了，我们的任务也更艰巨了，全党应该鼓起干劲，打掉官气，实事求是，与人民打成一片，克服一切作风上、工作上、制度上的缺点和错误。所有的革命志士，都应该继承我们光荣的革命传统，发扬朝气，扫除暮气，深入群众，深入实际，把我国的社会主义建设引向新的高潮。
