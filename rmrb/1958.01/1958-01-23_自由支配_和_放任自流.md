    "Free Disposition" and "Laissez-faire"
    Tang Qi, Renmin University of China
    Since the teaching reform in universities, the phrase "free disposition" has become a very popular buzzword on campus. "Free disposition" was originally proposed by the school to take care of students' health and studies. However, some students believe that "free disposition" means doing whatever you want in your free time outside of class, and no one has the right to interfere. In addition, the school leadership has not paid enough attention to this issue, so "free disposition" has turned into "laissez-faire" among some students. Some people bury their heads in books all day long, without rest or exercise; others loaf around all day, reading novels and playing games after class, watching movies three or four times a week. "Free disposition" has become a "shield" for not obeying discipline.
    Recently, the school leadership has begun to pay attention to this problem and has carried out inspections and rectifications of study discipline, which has been welcomed by the students. I believe that it is necessary for all universities to include the inspection and rectification of study discipline in their rectification content, because an important part of the school's rectification work is to improve teaching. Therefore, while improving "teaching," it is also necessary to improve "learning," and students' compliance with study discipline is a reliable guarantee for improving "learning" or "learning well." In addition, I believe that whether students observe study discipline and how students treat "free disposition" is essentially an ideological issue, so it is entirely necessary to include it in the content of socialist ideological education, so that students can conduct a "revolutionary examination" on this issue themselves: For whom am I studying? Am I worthy of the Party, the motherland, and the people? How should I study in the future?

### “自由支配”和“放任自流”

    “自由支配”和“放任自流”
    中国人民大学　唐琦
    自从高等学校进行教学改革后，“自由支配”这句话在学校里成了非常流行的口头语。“自由支配”本是学校为了照顾同学的健康和学习而提出的。但是有一些同学却认为“自由支配”就是在上课以外的时间里你想干什么就干什么，别人无权干涉；再加上学校领导上对这个问题的重视不够，“自由支配”在一些同学中间便一变而成了“放任自流”。有的人一天到晚把头埋在书里，不休息，也不锻炼；有的人整天吊儿郎当，一下课就看小说，玩，一星期看上三、四次电影。“自由支配”成了不遵守纪律的“挡箭牌”。
    最近，我校领导上开始注意了这个问题，进行了学习纪律的检查和整顿，受到了同学们的欢迎。我认为，各高等学校都有必要把检查和整顿学习纪律列入自己整改的内容中去，因为学校整改工作的重要一环便是改进教学工作，所以，在改进“教”的同时，也必须改进“学”，而学生遵守学习纪律正是改进“学”或者说是“学好”的可靠保证。另外，我认为，学生是否遵守学习纪律，学生怎样对待“自由支配”实质上也是一个思想问题，因此也完全有必要把它列入到社会主义思想教育的内容中去，让同学们自己在这个问题上进行一次“革命的考试”：我到底在为谁学习？我是否对得起党、对得起祖国、对得起人民？我今后要怎样学习？
