Concerning the Four Pests Elimination Campaign, I would like to share some general knowledge about rodent damage and how to eliminate rodents.

**Rodents in China**

Rodents, scientifically known as Rodentia, are called such because their incisors grow continuously throughout their lives. Therefore, rodents must constantly wear down their incisors to prevent them from growing too long and hindering their ability to eat.

Rodents are the most numerous mammals, estimated to account for more than half of all mammals. If calculated by the number of individuals, it would be an even larger figure.

China has about 130 species of rodents. The most common house rats and field rats are:

House Rats: The three most prevalent in China are the brown rat (also known as the Norway rat or sewer rat), the roof rat (also known as the black rat), and the house mouse. North of the Yangtze River, the dominant species is the brown rat, followed by a small number of house mice. South of the Yangtze River, the roof rat is the most common, followed by the brown rat, and then the house mouse.

Brown rats and roof rats are larger in size (adults reach 18 to 25 cm in body length), while house mice are smaller, with a body length of only about 10 cm. The main difference between brown rats and roof rats is that the former has shorter ears, which do not reach the eyes when folded forward, and a shorter tail, generally shorter than the body length. The latter has longer ears, which can reach the eyes or slightly beyond when folded forward, and a longer tail, generally longer than the body length. More importantly, roof rats are good climbers and prefer to live in ceilings.

Field Rats: In Northeast China, North China, and Inner Mongolia, common species include the Daurian ground squirrel (also known as the "bean toucher" or "big-eyed thief"), the striped dwarf hamster (small body, short tail, with a black line on its back), the striped field mouse (similar to the house mouse, but slightly larger, also with a black line on its back), and the house mouse. In the deserts and semi-deserts of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, there are the desert gerbil (similar to the brown rat, but yellow in color, with a small tuft of hair at the end of the tail) and the vole (resembles a small rabbit but without a tail and very short ears). The most common species in the southern provinces include the ricefield rat (similar to the roof rat, but with a white abdomen), the chestnut white-bellied vole, the striped field mouse (same as the northern striped field mouse, but without a black line on its back), and so on. In the mountainous and hilly grasslands of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Tibet, and northern Inner Mongolia, there are marmots (also known as groundhogs).

Xinjiang does not have true house rats, but there are a large number of desert gerbils and hamsters that originally lived in the wild and now live indoors.

**Harm of Rodents to Human Life**

The harm of rodents to human life is not only serious but also multifaceted. It can be broadly divided into the following aspects:

First, Spreading Diseases:

In China, diseases closely related to rodents include the following:

(1) Plague: Originally an epidemic among Daurian ground squirrels, marmots, desert gerbils, house rats, and other rodents, but it can be transmitted to humans through flea bites or direct contact with diseased or dead rats. Plague has a high mortality rate (without treatment, bubonic plague has a mortality rate of over 70%, pneumonic plague and septicemic plague have a mortality rate of 100%), spreads rapidly, and poses a great threat to humans. Before liberation, during epidemic periods in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places, tens of thousands of people often died. During major epidemics, the death toll could reach tens of thousands. After liberation, the spread of plague has been basically controlled.

(2) Scrub Typhus: The pathogen is Rickettsia. It is prevalent in the southern provinces of China and has a high mortality rate. It is closely related to rats (house rats and field rats). Rodents can store Rickettsia, which is transmitted to humans through the bites of mites.

(3) Murine Typhus: Formerly prevalent in Northeast China. The pathogen is also a type of Rickettsia, closely related to house rats, and is transmitted to humans through fleas. Transmission between humans also occurs through lice, and the mortality rate is very high.

(4) Leptospirosis: Prevalent in southern China. The pathogen is Leptospira. Roof rats, bandicoot rats (also known as Nesokia indica), and ricefield rats can all store Leptospira in their bodies and excrete it through urine. If ponds, paddy fields, etc., are contaminated by rat urine containing Leptospira, and people then work in the paddy fields or bathe in the ponds, the pathogen can enter the body through the skin and cause illness. The mortality rate is also quite high.

(5) Forest Encephalitis: Mainly distributed in the forest areas of the northern provinces of China. The virus is stored in the bodies of chipmunks (Eutamias sibiricus) and ticks, and is transmitted to humans through tick bites. The mortality rate is also relatively high.

(6) Tularemia: Also an epidemic among field rats, transmitted to humans through the bites of mosquitoes, horseflies, ticks, or by ingestion of food contaminated by the feces and urine of diseased rats. Although the mortality rate is low, the course of the disease is long, greatly affecting labor production.

(7) Tick-borne Relapsing Fever: The pathogen is a spirochete, transmitted to humans through tick bites. The great gerbil and house rats are the main reservoirs of this spirochete. This disease has been found in Xinjiang.

(8) Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome: The pathogen is a virus, closely related to the striped field mouse and the black striped field mouse, and is transmitted to humans through mite bites. This disease is prevalent in Northeast China.

(9) Schistosomiasis: Recently, Chinese scientists have demonstrated that the spread of schistosomiasis is also related to rodents to some extent. Certain rodents can be infected with cercariae, which develop into adult worms in the rat's body, and lay eggs in the rat's feces. After hatching, they infect snails, and then infect humans.

As mentioned above, we can understand that eliminating rodents is the most fundamental way to prevent certain diseases that are most harmful to the people.

Second, Stealing and Spoiling Grain and Other Food:

The main food of rodents is grain and other plant leaves, stems, seeds, fruits, and roots.

Each brown rat eats about 25 to 75 grams of grain per day, about 9 to 17.5 kilograms per year. Roof rats eat slightly less, and house mice eat about 10 grams per day. According to estimates by some scholars in Europe, America, and India, the actual number of house rats is roughly equal to the population (of course, this estimate is not absolutely accurate, but only a rough estimate). Assuming that brown rats and house mice each account for half (in reality, brown rats are much more numerous than house mice), then house rats in China eat about 4 million tons of grain per year. (This figure is also a rough estimate, because house rats do not necessarily eat all grain.) Adding the grain that is spoiled, the amount of grain wasted by house rats each year is considerable.

Not only house rats, but also field rats spoil grain and damage crops to a significant extent. For example, in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, large areas of seedlings are damaged by Daurian ground squirrels every year, and in some places, it is even necessary to replant or re-sow. The phenomenon of ricefield rats damaging rice paddies and sweet potato fields is also common in the southern provinces. In some areas, it is particularly serious, greatly reducing crop yields.

In addition to eating and spoiling grain, some rodents also transport large amounts of grain into their burrows for storage. For example, the burrows of long-clawed gerbils sometimes store up to 5 kilograms of grain. In 1949, the masses in Chifeng County, Inner Mongolia, dug out 71 shi and 2 dou of various grains from gerbil burrows in two months.

In addition to harming grains, melon fields, vegetable gardens, orchards, and other places are also frequently attacked by rodents, causing economic losses to humans.

Third, Damaging Afforestation:

Red-backed voles and grey-sided voles in the forests of Northeast China steal large quantities of red pine seeds that have been sown, causing great losses to red pine afforestation efforts (at present, China's scientific workers, in close cooperation with workers, have basically solved this problem).

Fourth, Damaging Dikes and Dams, Causing Floods:

Due to field rats digging holes in dikes, they create hidden dangers in the dikes. For example, in Tongliao County, Inner Mongolia, there have been cases in the past where field rats digging holes in dikes led to dike breaches and disasters.

Fifth, Damaging Sundries and Furniture:

Because rodents need to maintain the normal length of their incisors, they often grind their teeth, and furniture, sundries, clothing, books, doors, and windows become their grinding tools. Sometimes, they even bite through electrical wires, causing electrical fires. This also causes us great economic losses.

As mentioned above, the harm of rodents to human life, if carefully calculated, can reach an astonishing degree. Some estimate that the annual losses caused by rodents in the United States are about 2.5 billion US dollars. In India, the direct and indirect losses of grain caused by rodents each year amount to 7 million tons.

**General Living Habits of Rodents**

Different species of rodents have different living habits. However, in general, rodents share common characteristics such as high alertness, strong adaptability, agility, and timidity.

House rats such as brown rats and house mice mostly live under floors, in walls, and in sewers, while roof rats mostly live in ceilings and the upper parts of walls. Rat burrows often open at the base of walls, corners, around ceilings, and under beds and cabinets.

When house rats come out of their burrows, they prefer to walk along walls or through hollow walls. Roof rats have strong climbing ability and can climb up roofs along not-so-smooth corners.

House rats generally only move around at night. But when necessary (e.g., hunger), they can also come out of their burrows during the day. Although the burrows of roof rats are mostly in the upper part of houses, they often come to the ground in search of food.

The food of house rats, especially brown rats, is very complex. They eat almost anything that humans can eat. In addition, garbage, rotten food, and even feces can become their food. Generally speaking, brown rats prefer meat, while house mice and roof rats prefer vegetarian food.

The most frequent time for house rats to look for food is within three to four hours after people go to bed at night. After that, they gradually decrease their activity and mostly enter their burrows at dawn to stop activity.

In addition, house rats are also very sensitive to environmental changes. Moving a box or cabinet can sometimes cause them to be surprised, but they can generally get used to it quickly.

**Rodent Reproduction**

Rodents have a strong reproductive capacity. Most rodents can reproduce several times a year (generally two to four times). Some rodents can even mate and become pregnant immediately after giving birth. Each litter has four to seven offspring, and some rodents can have up to twelve or thirteen. Some have calculated in the laboratory that a pair of brown rats can reproduce up to 800 offspring in a year. However, under natural conditions, due to human prevention and control, the influence of poor living conditions, and the invasion of various infectious diseases, they cannot reach such high numbers.

Most rodents have an early sexual maturity period. Brown rats take about three months, while house mice only take about two months.

Although most rodents can reproduce in all seasons under good living conditions, April and May in the spring and around September in the autumn are two reproductive peaks. Therefore, if rodent control work is carried out before these two peak periods, the results will be significant.

**Methods of Rodent Control**

Rodent control work is best carried out on a large scale by everyone working together. Otherwise, if you catch and kill rodents in one place but relax in another, the rodents can run back and forth, and the results will not be significant. In addition, rodent control work should also follow the principle of "from home to field, from near to far," and give priority to catching and killing the more harmful rodents. The methods of rodent control can be basically divided into three categories:

First, Mechanical Rodent Control:

The biggest advantage of mechanical rodent control is that it is simple and easy to implement, most people can master it, and it does not cost much.

The Chinese people have also demonstrated outstanding talent in mechanical rodent control. According to very incomplete statistics, the vast majority of the Chinese people have created more than 100 kinds of folk rat traps. Some of them are simple in structure, low in cost, easy to obtain materials, and highly efficient. Below is a brief introduction to the use of several mechanical rat traps:

(1) Drawer-Chopstick Method:

Use chopsticks to prop up the drawer, and then tie the bait with a rope to the fulcrum of the chopsticks. When the rat eats the bait, the drawer will fall due to the movement of the chopsticks, and the rat will be captured.

(2) Sliding Board-Bucket Method:

Use a bucket, fill it with half water, and make one end of a wooden board into a rotating sliding board. Put the bait on the sliding board. When the rat eats the bait, it falls into the water due to its own weight pressing down the sliding board.

(3) Rolling Corn Method:

Pass a wire through an ear of corn, set it up on the edge of the bucket, and build a convenient bridge with a wooden board. When the rat climbs onto the corn via the bridge, it will fall into the water and die due to the rolling of the corn.

(4) Upright Bamboo Tube Method:

Make a bamboo tube with a bottom, put the bait in the bottom of the tube. When the rat enters the tube to eat, it can be caught due to its own weight pressing the tube upright.

In order to improve the effect of mechanical rodent control, the following principles should generally be followed:

A. When placing rat traps (rat traps, rat cages, etc.), it is best to set the bait and leave it "empty" for two to three days, so that the rats get used to the rat trap and feel that the rat trap is not scary. Then, officially set up the mechanism to catch and kill.

B. The bait on the rat trap is best to use fresh, high-moisture bait. If possible, the type of rat trap can also be changed after a certain period of time, or it can be used alternately with chemical rodent control methods. This will be even more effective.

C. Choose the appropriate bait. You should try to use food that rodents cannot easily obtain in their surrounding environment. For example, in grain warehouses, you can use leftover chicken feet, duck feet, meat skin, sparrow meat, and various vegetables as bait. Conversely, in vegetable stores and vegetable cellars, you can use baked cakes, cornbread, and steamed buns as bait.

D. Rat traps that must be baited should not be placed at the entrance of the burrow, but should be placed at the base of the wall, corners (and also some distance from the wall), under the bed, and under the cabinet at a certain distance from the entrance of the burrow. And it is best to put the end with the pedal and mechanism facing the wall, so that you can catch rats coming from three directions. If you use rat traps that do not require bait, you can surround the entrance of the burrow with three to four rat traps.

E. After the rat trap catches the rat, it should be washed with boiling water once to maintain cleanliness.

In addition to rat trapping equipment, digging burrows, irrigating burrows, and turning over firewood piles are also very effective methods for catching and killing field rats.

Second, Chemical Rodent Control:

Using chemical drugs to kill rats is very effective, but because some drugs are more expensive, some drugs are produced in small quantities, and some drugs also require certain techniques to use, they cannot be used on a large scale.

When selecting chemical drugs, you should of course choose drugs that are very effective in killing rats, harmless to humans and animals, and inexpensive. The "Antu" sold on the market today is a rat poison that is closer to this requirement.

The principles for choosing bait are roughly the same as for mechanical rodent control, but you should also consider the condition that it is easy to mix with poison. Generally, when poisoning house rats, flour is mostly used. If possible, add appropriate fish meal, fish soup, and other seasonings to make flour balls, or coat the outside of the flour balls with a layer of edible oil, which will have a better effect (fried or stir-fried flour balls are of course better). For poisoning field rats, it is best to use grains (rice, corn, oats, etc.), heat them to allow the poison to penetrate the inside of the grains, or use oil, paste, etc., to stick the poison to the outside of the grains.

In addition, when poisoning house rats, you can first place non-toxic bait for three to five days to allow the rats to get used to it, and then use poisonous bait, which will be very effective.

The following is a brief introduction to the properties and specific usage methods of two rat poisons:

1. Antu: Light gray powder, insoluble in water, not easily deteriorated by humidity and temperature, easy to store. It is highly toxic to brown rats, but less toxic to roof rats and field rats, and even less toxic to humans and animals, so it is safer, but it must also be strictly managed. Poison bait preparation method: Add 99 parts of bait to one part of Antu (calculated by weight, the same below), and add appropriate amount of water to make poison pills, each weighing one gram, put five to ten pills in each rat burrow.

2. Zinc Phosphide: Black powder, with a special phosphorus odor, difficult to dissolve in water, long-term storage will gradually reduce its toxicity. It is not only toxic to rats, but also very toxic to humans and animals. The preparation of poisonous bait must also be guided by people with specialized knowledge, so it is not suitable for use in most families. Poison bait preparation method: Use three to five parts of zinc phosphide and ninety-five to ninety-seven parts of bait to make poison pills, each weighing one gram, put three to five pills in each burrow (for house rats). Or use ten to twenty parts of zinc phosphide, eighty to ninety parts of grains (corn, rice, oats, etc.), add some edible oil, and fully stir with a special mixer to make the zinc phosphide fully and evenly coated on the surface of the grains. The amount used depends on the type of field rat being poisoned.

It is worth mentioning that recently, the Hebei Provincial Institute for the Prevention and Control of Plague has used low doses of Antu poison bait and zinc phosphide poison bait in large quantities to carry out the work of poisoning house rats. The effect is very good, and no poisoning incidents have occurred (some people have mistakenly eaten 35 grams of low-dose zinc phosphide poison bait without causing serious poisoning symptoms). Their two poison bait preparation methods are as follows:

① Antu 0.5 parts, plus 99.5 parts of flour, made into flour balls (each weighing 1 gram), stir-fried with oil.

② Zinc phosphide 1.0 parts, plus 99.0 parts of flour, made into flour balls (each weighing 1 gram), stir-fried with oil.

Put three pills of the above-mentioned poison bait in each burrow. This experience is worth trying out in various places.

In addition, the following two methods of poisoning rats can also be applied in places where conditions permit, and the effect is very good.

Poison Spraying Rat Burrow Method: This is a relatively new rodent control method. Taking advantage of the habit of rats often liking to clean their fur with their mouths, spray the poison deep into the burrow, or places where rats often pass by, such as the base of the wall, corners, etc. When the rat enters and exits the burrow, or passes by the base of the wall and corners, some poison powder will be stained on its body and feet. When it cleans its fur with its mouth, it will eat some poison and die. This method can generally use pure Antu (one gram per burrow) or one part Antu and one part burnt ash (screened charcoal powder, firewood ash, etc.) to make poison powder (spray two grams per burrow) to spray deep into the burrow. If there is no instrument for spraying powder into the rat burrow, you can block the entrance of the burrow with broken cotton, hemp knives, thread ends, etc. soaked in poison powder, which can also achieve good results. Because rats like to use cotton, hemp knives, etc. to make nests, when it takes them to the burrow, it also eats the poison powder on the cotton or hemp knives, and therefore dies.

3. Poisoned Water: Taking advantage of the habit of brown rats and house mice liking to drink water, in places where water sources are scarce, such as grain warehouses, poisoned water can be made to kill rats. The preparation method is as follows: Use shallow, flat water containers, put in ordinary cold water, and then sprinkle Antu 0.3 grams or zinc phosphide 0.5 grams per 100 square centimeters of water surface. When sprinkling, be careful to sprinkle it little by little with chicken feathers, so that the poison forms a thin film on the water surface. Otherwise, the poison will sink to the bottom and the effect will not be significant. When the rat drinks water, it can swallow the poison and die. In winter, in warehouses without heating equipment, snow ninety-nine parts plus Antu one part or zinc phosphide three parts can be mixed to make poisoned snow, and the effect of poisoning rats is also very good.

4. Biological Rodent Control:

For house rats, raising cats is the best biological rodent control method. Dogs are also natural enemies of rodents, but their effect is much lower than that of cats. Some other small carnivores, such as weasels, foxes, etc., and some birds of prey, such as eagles, owls that are active at night, etc., also play a great role in eliminating rodent damage and should be properly protected.

**Rat Prevention Methods**

Finally, let's talk about the issue of rat prevention. Rat prevention is one of the fundamental ways to eliminate house rats. According to research by the Soviet Central Disinfection Institute, the following simpler rat prevention measures can achieve great results:

① Doors without gaps.

② The foundation under the floor is made of stone.

③ Install rat-proof wire mesh on windows.

④ Seal up the gaps between various pipes and walls.

⑤ If you encounter a rat burrow, block it tightly with stones and bricks.

In rural areas, the most important and easier to implement is to strictly store grain and things that rodents can eat, and to pad up firewood piles. The three diagrams here are simple rat-proof granaries, corn buildings, and base platforms for firewood piles created by farmers in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia.

In order to prevent rodents from damaging furniture and clothing, farmers in the plague-stricken areas of Inner Mongolia and Northeast China have padded up their furniture with bricks and wood, which has also achieved good results, and it is easier to find rat burrows and catch and kill them.

专栏：

    谈谈如何消灭鼠害
    中国医学科学院流行病学研究所  纪树立
    为了配合除四害运动，我谨将有关鼠害和消灭鼠害的一些常识介绍如下。
    我国的鼠类
    鼠类学名叫啮齿类，其所以叫啮齿类，是因为它的门齿终生不断生长，因此鼠类必须不断磨损它的门齿，以免生长过长妨碍摄食。
    鼠类是哺乳动物中种类最多的动物，估计约占全部哺乳类中半数以上，如果以个体数来计算将更是一个庞大的数字。
    我国大约有鼠类一百三十种左右。最常见的家鼠和野鼠有下列几种：
    家鼠：在我国最普遍的有三种，即：褐家鼠（又称大家鼠，沟鼠），黄胸鼠（又称屋顶鼠）及鼷鼠（又称小家鼠）。在长江以北的各省份主要是褐家鼠，其次有少量的鼷鼠。在长江以南各省份主要是黄胸鼠，褐家鼠次之，鼷鼠又次之。
    褐家鼠和黄胸鼠体型较大（成熟时体长达十八到二十五厘米），鼷鼠较小，体长只有十厘米左右，褐家鼠和黄胸鼠的主要区别是，前者耳较短，前折时达不到眼，尾也较短，一般短于身长。后者耳较长，前折时可达眼或稍超过，尾也较长，一般大于身长，更重要的一个区别就是黄胸鼠善于攀登，喜欢居住在天花板上。
    野鼠在东北、华北、内蒙古一般常见的种类有黄鼠（又称豆触子，大眼贼）、小仓鼠（又称大腮鼠，体小尾短，背上有一条黑线）、黑线鼠（很像鼷鼠，但体型稍大，背上也有一条黑线），以及鼷鼠。内蒙古、新疆的沙漠和半沙漠地带有沙土鼠（很像褐家鼠，但色黄，尾的末端有一个不大的毛穗）以及鸣鼠（很像小兔子但没有尾巴，耳朵也很短）。南方各省最常见的有罗赛鼠（很像黄胸鼠，但腹部是白色）、绒背小田鼠、黑线鼠（和北方的黑线鼠一样，但背部无黑线）等等。在新疆、青海、西藏及内蒙古北部的山地和丘陵草原地带则有土拨鼠（又称旱獭）分布。
    新疆没有真正的家鼠，但室内有大量的原来在野外居住的沙土鼠和仓鼠。
    鼠类对人生的害处
    鼠类对人生的害处不仅是严重的，而且是多方面的，大体上可以分成下列几方面：
    第一、传染疾病：
    在我国和鼠类有密切关系的疾病有下列各种：
    （一）鼠疫：本来是黄鼠、土拨鼠、沙土鼠、家鼠以及其他鼠类的流行病，但可以经由跳蚤的叮咬，或直接接触病鼠、死鼠而传染于人。鼠疫的病死率很高（不加治疗时，腺鼠疫70％以上死亡，肺鼠疫、败血症鼠疫100％死亡），传播迅速，给人类的威胁很大，解放前我国东北、内蒙古、云南、福建、广东等地在流行时期常有成千上万的人死亡，大流行时死亡可达几万人。解放后已基本上控制了鼠疫的流行。
    （二）恙虫病：病原体是立克次小体，在我国南方各省有流行，病死率也较高，和老鼠（家鼠及野鼠）有密切的关系。鼠类可以保存立克次小体，经由恙虫的叮咬而传染于人。
    （三）地方性斑疹伤寒：过去在我国东北有流行。病原体也是一种立克次小体，和家鼠有密切关系，经由跳蚤传染于人。人与人之间又通过虱子互相传染，病死率也很高。
    （四）钩端螺旋体病：在我国南部有流行，病原体是钩端螺旋体。黄胸鼠、板齿鼠（又称拟袋鼠）、罗赛鼠的体内都可以保存钩端螺旋体，并经尿排出体外，如果池塘、水田等被带有钩端螺旋体的鼠尿所污染，人再进入水田工作或在池塘内洗澡，则病原体就可以经皮肤进入体内发病，病死率也相当高。
    （五）森林脑炎：主要分布于我国的北方各省森林地带，病毒保存于缟纹鼠（花鼠，五道眉）等及?的体内，经?的叮咬而传染于人，病死率也较高。
    （六）野兔热：也是野鼠的流行病，通过蚊、虻、?的叮咬，或由病鼠的粪、尿污染了食物等经口感染于人。病死率虽然低，但病程很长，影响劳动生产很大。
    （七）?传性回归热：病原体是螺旋体，经由?的叮咬传染于人，大沙土鼠及家鼠是本病螺旋体的主要储存者，本病在新疆已有发现。
    （八）流行性出血热：病原体是病毒，和米氏小田鼠、黑线鼠有密切的关系，经螨的叮咬感染于人，我国东北有这种病流行。
    （九）血吸虫病：最近我国的科学家们曾证明血吸虫的传播也和鼠类有一定的关系，某些鼠类，能够感染尾蚴，并在鼠体内发育成虫，在鼠粪中排卵，孵化后，感染钉螺，再感染人。
    如上所述，我们可以了解到消灭鼠类，是预防某些危害人民最严重的疾病的最根本办法。
    第二、盗食和糟塌粮食和其他食品：
    鼠类的主要食料是粮食和其他植物的叶、茎、种子、果实、根等。
    每只褐家鼠大约每日要吃去粮食二十五到七十五克，一年约吃去九公斤乃至十七公斤半，黄胸鼠要稍微少一些，鼷鼠每日要吃去十克左右。如果按欧、美和印度某些学者的估计，家鼠的实际数字大致和人口相等（当然这种估计不是绝对正确的，而只是一种粗略的估计）。再假定褐家鼠和鼷鼠各占一半（实际上褐家鼠要比鼷鼠多得多），那么我国的家鼠每年吃去粮食约四百万吨左右。（这个数字也是一个粗略估计，因为家鼠也不一定全吃粮食。）再加上被糟塌的粮食，每年因家鼠所浪费掉的粮食是相当可观的。
    不仅家鼠如此，野鼠糟塌粮食、损坏农作物的情形也相当严重。例如东北、内蒙古一带每年都有大片土地的禾苗被黄鼠咬坏，有些地方甚至不得不补种或重种。南方的罗赛鼠为害稻田、蕃薯田的现象也很普遍。有的地区也特别严重，使农作物的收获量大为减少。
    有些鼠类除了吃掉粮食，糟塌粮食之外，还要大量的将粮食搬进洞内贮藏起来。例如长爪沙土鼠的洞内有时贮粮达五公斤。1949年内蒙古赤峰县在两个月期间中，群众从沙土鼠洞内挖出来的各种粮食达七十一石二斗。
    除了危害谷物之外，瓜田、菜园、果园等地，也经常可以受到鼠类的侵袭，而使人类遭受经济上的损失。
    第三、破坏造林：
    东北森林地带的赤背小田鼠、棕背小田鼠，大量盗食播下的红松种子，使红松的造林工作蒙受了很大损失（目前我国的科学工作者在工人的密切配合下，已基本上解决了这个问题）。
    第四、破坏堤防，酿成水灾：
    由于野鼠在堤上打洞，因而造成了堤防的隐患，例如内蒙古通辽县过去就有过因野鼠在堤上打洞，而招致决堤成灾的事例。
    第五、损坏杂物、家具：
    由于鼠类要维持正常长度的门齿，因此它们经常磨牙，而家具杂物、衣服、书籍、门窗等等都成了它的磨牙工具，有时甚至于咬坏了电线，而造成电线走火事件。这也使我们在经济上遭受很大的损失。
    如上所述鼠类对人生的危害，如果仔细计算起来可以达到相当惊人的程度。有人估计，美国每年因鼠类所遭受的损失约合二十五亿美金。印度每年因鼠类直接间接损失的粮食达七百万吨。鼠类的一般生活习性
    鼠类的种类不同，生活习性也随之有所不同。但是一般说来，鼠类都有警觉性高，适应性强，敏捷灵活，而又胆小的共同特性。
    家鼠中的褐家鼠和鼷鼠多栖息于地板下、墙壁和阴沟中，黄胸鼠则多栖息于天花板上，以及墙壁之上部。鼠洞多开口于墙基、墙角、天花板的四周，以及床、柜的底下。
    家鼠出洞活动的时候，喜欢靠墙行走，或者穿夹壁行走，黄胸鼠攀登能力很强，可以沿不大光滑的墙角爬上屋顶。
    家鼠在一般情况下只在夜间活动。但在不得已时（例如饥饿），日间也可以出洞活动。黄胸鼠的洞虽然多半是在房屋的上部，但是为了寻找食物，也经常到地面活动。
    家鼠，特别是褐家鼠的食料非常复杂，几乎凡是人可以吃的东西它都吃，此外，垃圾、腐败的食品，甚至粪便也都可以成为它的食料。一般来讲，褐家鼠喜欢肉食，鼷鼠和黄胸鼠则偏于素食。
    家鼠寻找食物的时间以夜晚人们入寝以后三到四小时之内活动最为频繁，以后就渐渐减少，天明时大部入洞，停止活动。
    此外，家鼠对环境改变的感觉也很锐敏。一箱一柜的移动，有时就会引起它们的惊异，但一般很快就可以习惯如故。
    鼠类的繁殖
    鼠类的繁殖力很强。大多数鼠类一年可以繁殖好几次（一般可达二到四次），有些鼠类甚至在产仔之后马上又可以交尾怀胎，每次产仔四到七只，某些鼠类最多可达十二到十三只。有人在实验室内计算，一对褐家鼠一年可以繁殖到八百只。但在自然条件下，由于人的防制以及受不良生存条件的影响，和各种传染病的侵袭，不能达到如此高的数字。
    大多数鼠类的性成熟期很早，褐家鼠约须三个月左右，鼷鼠只要二个月左右。
    虽然大多数鼠类在良好的生存条件下，四季都可以繁殖，但是春季四、五月，秋季九月前后，是两个繁殖高潮。因此除鼠工作如果在这两个高潮期以前进行，收效是很大的。
    灭鼠的方法
    灭鼠工作，最好在广大范围内大家一齐动手进行。否则，此地捕打，彼处放松，鼠类可以跑来跑去，收效不大。此外，灭鼠工作还应当遵守“由家及野，从近到远”的原则，尽先捕杀危害较大的鼠类。灭鼠的方法，基本上可以分为三大类：
    第一、器械灭鼠：
    器械灭鼠的最大优点就是简单易行，大多数群众能够掌握，而且花钱不多。
    我国人民在器械灭鼠方面也表现了卓越的才能。据非常不完全的统计，我国广大群众自己创造的民间捕鼠器即达百余种，其中有一些构造简单，造价低廉，取材容易，效率很高的。下面简单介绍几种器械捕鼠器的用法：
    （一）抽屉竹筷法：
    用竹筷将抽屉支起，再将诱饵用绳系在筷子的支点，鼠食诱饵时，因竹筷移动，抽屉下落，即将鼠捕住。
    （二）滑板水桶法：
    用一水桶，盛一半水，将一木板，一端制成能转动的滑板，把诱饵放在滑板上，鼠食诱饵时由于自身体重压下滑板，坠入水中。
    （三）滚玉米法：
    用铁丝穿过一穗玉米，架在水桶的边缘上，并用木板搭一便桥，鼠经便桥爬上玉米时，因玉米滚动，鼠则落水而死。
    （四）直立竹筒法：
    制成有底的竹筒，筒底放入诱饵，鼠类入筒取食，由于自身体重，压筒直立，即可捕得。
    为了提高器械捕鼠的效果，一般应遵守下列几个原则：
    甲，布放捕鼠器（鼠夹、鼠笼等等）的时候最好先设饵虚放二到三天，使鼠对捕鼠器习惯，感到捕鼠器并不可怕，然后再正式将机关支起捕打。
    乙，捕鼠器上的诱饵，最好使用新鲜的多水分的，如果可能，还可以在一定时期之后更换捕鼠器的类型，或者和使用化学药品灭鼠法，轮替进行，这样效果更高。
    丙，要选择适当的诱饵，应该尽量使用鼠类在其附近环境里不易得到的食料。例如在粮食仓库，可以用吃剩下的鸡脚、鸭脚、肉皮、麻雀肉以及各种蔬菜作诱饵，反之在蔬菜商店、菜窖等地，就可以用烙饼、窝头、馒头作诱饵。
    丁，必须放诱饵的捕鼠器，不应放在洞口，而应放在和洞口有一定距离的墙基、墙角（和墙也要有一些距离）、床下、柜下。而且最好把有踏板、机关的一头正对墙壁，这样可以捕打由三个方向来的鼠类。如果使用不用诱饵的捕鼠器，可以用三到四个捕鼠器包围洞口。
    戊，捕鼠器捕住鼠类之后，应该用开水烫洗一次，以维持清洁。
    此外，除捕鼠器械之外，对捕灭野鼠，采用挖洞、灌洞、翻柴草垛等方法也有很大的效果。
    第三、化学药品灭鼠：
    用化学药品毒鼠效果很高，但是由于某些药品成本较高，某些药品产量较少，某些药品在使用时还要求一定的技术，因此不能在广大范围内使用。
    在选择化学药品的时候，当然应该选择毒鼠效力很高，对人畜无害，而且价格低廉的药品，目前市上出卖的“安妥”，就是比较接近这个要求的毒家鼠药品。
    对诱饵的选择和器械捕鼠的诱饵选择原则大致相同，但是还应该考虑便于和毒药混合在一起的这个条件。一般毒家鼠时多使用面粉，如果可能再加适当的鱼粉、鱼汤等调味品制成面丸，或在面丸外面再涂一层食用油，则效果更好一些（油炸或油炒面丸当然更好）。毒野鼠最好使用谷粒（稻粒、玉米粒、燕麦粒，等等）加热将毒药浸入谷粒内部，或用油脂、浆糊等将毒药沾在谷粒的外面。
    此外，在毒家鼠时，可以先把无毒诱饵放置三到五天，使鼠习惯之后再用毒饵，收效很大。
    下面简单介绍一下两种毒鼠药的性状和具体使用方法：
    1、安妥：浅灰色粉末，不溶于水，不易受潮湿和温度的影响而变质，便于贮藏。它对褐家鼠的毒力很高，但对黄胸鼠和野鼠的毒力较低，对人畜毒力更低，因此较为安全，但是也要严格管理。毒饵制法：安妥一份（按重量计算，下同）加诱饵九十九份，再加适当的水制成毒丸，每粒重一克，每个鼠洞放五到十粒。
    2、磷化锌：黑色粉末，有磷的特殊臭味，难溶于水，长期保存会渐渐减低毒力。它不仅对鼠类有毒，对人畜毒力也很高，制备毒饵时，又必须有专门知识的人指导，因此，不宜于广大家庭使用。毒饵制法：磷化锌三到五份，诱饵九十五到九十七份制成毒丸，每丸重一克，每洞放三至五丸（用于家鼠）。或用磷化锌十到二十份，谷粒（玉米、稻米、燕麦等）八十到九十份，外加食用油若干，用特制搅拌器充分搅拌，使磷化锌充分而均匀的涂于谷粒表面即可，根据毒杀的野鼠种类不同，使用份量也不同。
    值得提及的是，最近河北省鼠疫防治所，曾大量使用了低剂量的安妥毒饵和磷化锌的毒饵，进行毒杀家鼠工作，效果很好，且未发生中毒事件（有的人曾误食低剂量磷化锌毒饵三十五克也未发生严重中毒症状），他们的两种毒饵制备法如下：
    ①安妥　0.5份，加面99.5份，制成面丸（每粒重1克），加油炒熟。
    ②磷化锌　1.0份，加面99.0份，制成面丸（每粒重1克），加油炒熟。
    上记毒饵每洞放三粒。这个经验，颇值得各地试行。
    此外，下列两种毒鼠方法，在有条件的地方也可以应用，效果很好。
    毒药喷撒鼠洞法：是一种比较新的灭鼠方法，利用鼠类经常喜欢用口清理自己的皮毛的习惯，将毒药喷撒在洞口深部，或鼠类经常经过的地方，如墙根、墙角等等，当鼠出入洞口，或经过墙根、墙角时，身上、脚上沾污了一些毒粉，在它用口清理皮毛的时候，吃下了一些毒药因而致死。本法对家鼠一般可以用纯安妥（每洞一克）或安妥一份，烧灰（经筛过的木炭末、柴灰等）一份配成毒粉（每洞撒二克）向洞口深部喷撒。如果没有向鼠洞喷粉的器具，可以用沾满毒粉的破棉花、麻刀、线头等塞住洞口，也能收到良好的效果。因为棉花、麻刀等，鼠类喜欢用它作窠，当它往洞口衔的时候，也吃下了棉花或麻刀上的毒粉，因而致死。
    3、毒水毒鼠：利用褐家鼠、鼷鼠喜欢喝水的习性，在粮食仓库等水源缺乏的地方，可以制成毒水毒鼠。制备的方法是这样：用浅的扁平的盛水器皿，放入普通冷水，再按每一百平方厘米水面，撒上安妥零点三克，或磷化锌零点五克，撒的时候一定要小心的轻轻的用鸡毛一点一点的撒，以便毒药在水面形成薄膜，否则毒药沉底，效果不大。当鼠喝水的时候就可以吞下毒药而死。冬天，在没有防寒设备的仓库里，还可以用雪九十九份加安妥一份或磷化锌三份拌匀制成毒雪，其毒鼠的效果也很好。
    4、生物学灭鼠：
    对家鼠来说，养猫就是最好的生物学灭鼠法。狗也是鼠类的天然敌人，但其效果比起猫来要低得多。其他一些小型食肉兽，例如黄鼬（黄鼠狼）、狐狸等等，以及一些猛禽例如鹰，晚间活动的枭（猫头鹰）等，对消灭鼠害也起着很大的作用，应该加以适当的保护。
    防鼠的办法
    最后谈一谈防鼠的问题。防鼠工作是消灭家鼠的根本办法之一，根据苏联中央消毒研究所的研究证明，采取下列较简单的防鼠措施就可以收到很大的效果。即：
    ①门无缝。
    ②地板下的地基用石头造成。
    ③窗上安设防鼠铁丝网。
    ④堵严各种管道和墙壁间的空隙。
    ⑤遇鼠洞即用石头、砖头堵严。
    在乡村，最重要的而且行之较易的是严格收藏粮食和鼠类可吃的东西，以及垫起柴草垛。这里三个图，就是东北、内蒙古一带农民所创造的简易防鼠粮仓、玉米楼子及柴草垛底台。
    为了防止鼠类破坏家具和衣服，内蒙古、东北鼠疫疫区的农民将家具用砖木垫起来，也收到了很好的效果，而且这样做容易发现鼠洞，容易捕打。
