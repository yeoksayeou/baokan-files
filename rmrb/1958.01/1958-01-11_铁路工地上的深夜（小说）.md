    "A railway engineering bureau director told me: tasks that took a whole year of back-breaking labor to complete two or three years ago can now be accomplished methodically in four months with the same people and equipment. I was very excited to hear this. Because I know how the road has been walked. I know in the early years of the Five-Year Plan, how the people at the construction sites devoted themselves and groped forward in the chaos..."
　——Diary excerpt

    The moonlight illuminates the mountain gully as if it were daytime. A thin layer of frost covers the ground. Leaves are fluttering in the air.

    On the highway at the foot of the mountain, a jeep is parked. The driver, Zhao Yuqin, with his hands in his pockets, leans against the hood of the car, gazing at the construction site across the way. The shadow of his hat brim obscures his deep eyes.

    In the large workshop beside Old Zhao, hundreds of key personnel from the construction site are crowded together. They are arguing, sighing, contemplating, calculating… Words like labor force, materials, plans, production, etc., all revolve around the two words "cold prevention." These icy cold words of "cold prevention" slip out from the cracks of the workshop windows, climb onto driver Old Zhao's heart, and make him anxious. This isn't because he fears the cold weather will make it difficult to start the car, but because, like everyone in that meeting room, he is very familiar with the countless work points on the railway construction site. Therefore, he also knows: if the cold arrives early, what a disaster it will bring to the railway workers engaged in open-air operations!

    He looks at his watch. It's already two o'clock, but the meeting's host – the person everyone calls the chief commander – is still speaking in a loud voice inside the workshop.

    At 2:05, coughing, yawning, the sound of benches, and chaotic talking come from the workshop. People emerge from the workshop one after another. They have all been made sallow and thin by the intense daily and nightly life of the construction site. Some have hoarse voices, some have bloodshot eyes, some are burdened with worries, some have furrowed brows and are full of liver fire... As soon as everyone comes out of the workshop, they all look up at the sky and rub the frost on the ground with their feet, as if hoping that the frost on the ground is just an illusion caused by the moonlight.

    Finally, the chief commander comes out. This is a burly man. He carries a safety helmet in his left hand and wears a pair of straw sandals. His trouser legs are rolled up to his knees. He smells of cement, dirt, and diesel fuel. Isn't he just a strong laborer carrying a dirt basket? In fact, he is the highest responsible person on the construction site, commanding hundreds of large and small units and hundreds of thousands of workers. … Quite a few people are still surrounding him at the workshop door; requesting, complaining, threatening him with exaggerated difficulties. He raises his thick hand above his head and shakes it vigorously, laughing as he walks: "Hey, hey! I'm a pauper. You can't squeeze much oil out of my bones!" "You're crying poor? Your warehouse has everything you need. You're a big landlord. Even if I curse your ancestors for three generations, I'll still transfer ten tons of your explosives out tomorrow!"

    "Hey! The moon is pretty good!" After the chief commander gets rid of the people pestering him, he happily taps a rhythm on the engine hood with his fingers. Driver Old Zhao thinks: This is bad! He feels uneasy.

    Old Zhao stands behind the chief commander, takes a deep breath, wants to say something, but doesn't open his mouth. Why waste words? If you say, "It's late, let's just stay here," the chief commander will say in a joking tone: "No choice! The biggest regret for our generation is not getting enough sleep."

    Old Zhao silently hands the chief commander his jacket, then puts his hands in his pockets, leans his shoulder against the car, and stands there.

    The chief commander looks at Old Zhao's suggestive posture and says: "Four hours can cover two hundred kilometers. I can still get to the city in time to handle an important matter. Is that okay? Do you have any new plans?"

    Old Zhao sits in the car, grabs the steering wheel, stares straight ahead, and says: "It's like this every day. What's there to discuss?"

    "Good answer!" The chief commander shrugs, smiles, and sits in the seat next to the driver.

    With a "beep," the car starts.

    The road is full of rubble, newly unloaded steel, cement, and large trucks parked by the roadside, ready to be loaded with things. Old Zhao's car weaves around them. He glances sideways and sees the chief commander covering his forehead with his hand, his body swaying with the car's movements. He knows this is not the time to talk. The chief commander's mind is still filled with the scenes from the meeting; the various problems encountered on the construction site throughout the day are still weighing on him, and various impressions are still surrounding him. Only after the car has run twenty or thirty kilometers will the chief commander take the initiative to talk to him, Old Zhao.

    Sure enough, after less than forty minutes, the chief commander seems to shake off something heavy, stretches, then punches his palm with his fist, looks at the glittering river water below the road, and hums a song. After humming for a while, he says to himself: "It feels like a revolution is brewing in my stomach!"

    At this point, let alone having anything good to eat, if he could just knock on a villager's door and buy a few locally grown sweet potatoes to nibble on, he would be satisfied.

    Old Zhao silently grips the steering wheel with one hand and takes out things one by one from beside the seat with the other hand, placing them in the chief commander's lap: a military canteen full of hot boiling water, three sweet potatoes, two flatbreads, and two ounces of beef.

    The chief commander glances at Old Zhao with excitement and gratitude, then chews with relish. The car shakes, and boiling water spills onto his knees.

    At this moment, as always: this leader and this driver are about to have a lively conversation. The leader will talk about the things he encountered during the day and the things he is thinking about, his voice sometimes joyful, sometimes angry, sometimes distressed... and the driver will also talk about what he has seen and heard during the day. These messy, concrete, and vivid trivial matters often flash with important thoughts, and are things that someone in the position of chief commander cannot hear or see... But today is a little different: the chief commander doesn't say a word after finishing his food.

    After a while, the chief commander sticks his head out, looks at the sky, and says: "Damn weather! It's not even cold yet, and it suddenly frosts! If the temperature drops to zero tomorrow, it will be a death sentence! More than twenty bridge construction sites are pouring concrete!"

    Old Zhao pretends not to hear; a more pressing thought floods his mind. While driving, he glances sideways to the left—at the construction site across the river. There, where the electric lights are strung into a line, the Second Engineering Team is filling the roadbed; the place where millions of electric lights are connected into a single piece, like a city, is work point number 51. He desperately speeds up the car, and the wheels almost leave the ground, soaring into the air. Even the chief commander is surprised. Usually, Old Zhao, like those experienced drivers: goes fast when it's time to go fast, and goes slow when it's time to go slow, no matter how big the leader sitting in the car is, or what kind of instructions they haphazardly give, he doesn't change his habits.

    "Gotta go fast!" Old Zhao has a plan in mind. Work point number 51 is a key project. The engineering captain of this work point shouted a few days ago: "This is terrible! If two hundred tons of cement aren't delivered by 12:00 on the 29th, I'm going to hang myself!" This guy might block the chief commander's car on the road and pester him for a long time. He's cunning, figuring out the chief commander's pattern of activity on the construction site. But Old Zhao had already inquired clearly from the engineering office's dispatch room: the cement for work point number 51 will be used up by 12:00 the day after tomorrow. That loud and noisy engineering captain won't only not hang himself, but will also wink and joke with the workers. ... Gotta do everything possible to not let the chief commander be delayed on the road for even a second. That way, the chief commander can still rest for two hours when he gets back to the city. Otherwise, if there's a delay on the road, it'll be working hours when he gets to the city. The materials factory director, the engineers carrying large stacks of drawings, all kinds of inspection teams from higher levels, and hundreds of instructions, letters, and telegrams will all flood in and bury him, leaving him no room to breathe... And when he breaks out of this airtight siege, he will shout: "Old Zhao! Go to the site!"

    Gotta go fast! Gotta go fast! Once we pass this densely packed area of work points, it'll be good. But would you believe it, it just so happens to be blasting time right now, with the sound of gongs, whistles, and people shouting... The car is stopped by workers holding red flags every three to five kilometers: "Danger! No passing!" Every time the car stops, the chief commander jumps out agilely, puts his hands behind his back, and looks at the hilltop where the blasting is taking place. There, streaks of blue fire flash, followed by a booming sound that shakes the mountains... The chief commander walks back and forth excitedly, looking at the river water under his feet, as if he wants to wade across and run to the work point on the other side, to hold down this railway construction site stretching over a thousand miles and feel the pulse of the earth...

    As soon as the worker on guard duty announces: "Safe to pass!" Old Zhao immediately starts the car and shouts: "Leader! Let's go quickly!"

    "Not too slow! Judging by the progress here, if the weather doesn't get any colder, we'll be able to—"

    "Leader! We need to hurry!"

    The chief commander seems to suddenly wake up and says: "Oh! Gotta hurry!"

    The car rushes past several important work points. Old Zhao glances at the chief commander, thinking he's about to fall asleep, and breathes a sigh of relief, slowing down. So, this little car glides along the highway, sometimes speeding along the riverbank, sometimes ascending to the mountainside, sometimes circling around the foot of the mountain, sometimes passing through already sleeping villages.

    Suddenly, the chief commander knocks on the windshield and says: "Did we pass work point number 54? Stop the car!"

    Old Zhao pretends to be confused, speeding up even more and heading straight forward.

    The chief commander suddenly turns his head, two piercingly cold gazes shooting at Old Zhao's face, and says in a low voice: "Stop the car!"

    Daring not to delay! Old Zhao gradually reduces the car's speed, and only then slowly brings the car to a halt. In fact, this dragging process allows the car to slide forward several hundred meters again. There's a good reason: following the procedure step by step, can't violate operating regulations! Getting angry won't help.

    The chief commander flicks his head and says: "Turn around! Go back to work point number 54."

    Old Zhao presses his chin on the steering wheel and asks slowly: "Why go there?"

    "Nonsense! Don't you know I promised to give work point number 54 two hundred tons of steel today before four o'clock? But… they might have already stopped work waiting for materials! Damn it!"

    Old Zhao not only doesn't turn the car around, but continues to drive forward. He says: "I helped you remember this matter. This afternoon, I called the materials factory director in your name: told him to allocate the materials to work point number 54 first, and then complete the procedures later."

    The chief commander doesn't say anything, only lightly punches his palm with his fist. Old Zhao knows: this is a most satisfied action.

    The car races forward, carrying a gust of wind, entering a remote mountain gully. Old Zhao grips the steering wheel, looking ahead. The small trees and withered grass on both sides of the road are covered with frost flowers. The tires of large trucks have drawn two endless black stripes on the white-frosted highway. Occasionally, a fox jumps out of the roadside ditch. It stands in the middle of the road, dragging its tail, vigorously raising its head, curiously facing the car's bright headlights. After looking for a long time, it darts into the swaying wormwood. A moment later, a rabbit hidden in the woods is startled by the light and leaps onto the road, running around wildly.

    Old Zhao turns his head to look: the chief commander has already fallen asleep. In these tense, chaotic, and boiling days, Old Zhao has lost count of how many times he has seen the chief commander sleeping like this. Life puts difficult and heavy burdens on the shoulders of such people, and they can only close their eyes in the bumps of this car, accumulate strength, and then make courageous leaps forward. Old Zhao tries his best to keep the car steady so that the chief commander can sleep peacefully. But here, there are several material depots, and thousands of cars, tractors, horse-drawn carts, and handcarts pulling materials all day long have already damaged the advanced road surface for dozens of kilometers before and after. Under the illumination of the car lights, the road is simply like a wavy river. No matter how hard Old Zhao works, sweating profusely and using all his skills, the car still bumps. Every time it bumps, the chief commander moves, or his shoulders shrug.

    The car turns a corner, shaking off the construction site with its constant roars, and enters a quiet mountain valley. Old Zhao stretches his head to look at the surrounding terrain, and then quickly glances at the chief commander. He holds his breath, bites his lip, slowly reduces speed, and then mysteriously stops the car. He knows that he will be scolded when the chief commander wakes up. Who cares! As long as that brain that is constantly rotating like a motor can rest for a while, that's the most important thing in the world.

    There is the sound of dogs barking in the village on the opposite hillside. A flock of small birds on a roadside tree suddenly fly around and chirp, probably because a weasel has gotten into the bird's nest! Sleepiness climbs onto Old Zhao's eyelids. He really wants to sit on the stone next to the car, hug his knees, and get a good night's sleep. Hey! The person sitting in this car is no ordinary person. If a few vicious guys jumped out of the forest on the hillside… He pulls out the pistol from his waist, walks around the car, sharpens his eyes, and looks around, listening carefully to all kinds of noises. At this time, there are very few large trucks pulling materials, but a car always passes by every fifteen minutes or so. Old Zhao's heart is in his throat. He's afraid that those young drivers don't know what's good for them, and when they see a car parked here from afar, they'll honk their horns like crazy. Good thing! The cars speeding past only bring a gust of wind and don't honk their horns. Probably, those drivers who are busy day and night are also drowsing! Occasionally, a few horse-drawn carts pulling steel or wood pass by. The people who are getting up early are sitting on the carts wrapped in quilts, shrinking their heads and dozing while holding their whips. The horses walking between the shafts are snorting and walking leisurely.

    Old Zhao rubs his eyes hard and sees the chief commander leaning his head against the iron support of the car door, sleeping soundly. His right arm is hanging outside the car, and his sleeve has been pulled up. Tomorrow, this arm will definitely be sore and numb from being frozen by the wind. Old Zhao walks back and forth, his mind racing dozens of times, but he doesn't dare to disturb the chief commander. Hey! Look: this arm is so thick and strong. Try putting your ear to it, and you can definitely hear the sound of blood flowing vigorously in the blood vessels. Also, those three scars lined up on that arm are so clear in the moonlight. In fact, those mud-spotted clothes still cover more scars... But all of this is in the distant past. What is most concerning is that the chief commander is sleeping very sweetly. Look! The cool and pale light of the moon can't change the vibrant color on that face. That face is very rough, but it is broad, solid, resolute, and valiant. Suddenly, those huge nostrils flare, and he breathes roughly a few times; his eyebrows twitch a few times, and all his joints are making noise. Perhaps this person who is always cheerful and always encouraging others only allows fatigue to conquer him in his dreams! Only in his dreams does he show how harshly he usually squeezes out every drop of sweat and effort... Old Zhao's watch on his wrist is ticking! He taps his foot on the ground, counting the steps of time. Time, you think your fast pace always brings everything in the world around and around, bringing the chief commander around and around; you think you can bring life, and also make people's hair turn white... But Old Zhao has snatched a peaceful sleep from you for the chief commander...

    Suddenly, a large truck comes from afar, honking its horn vigorously. It's as if that unlucky driver is going to complete two hundred thousand kilometers of safe driving by dawn and then go to collect a bonus.

    Old Zhao's face is ashen, and he wishes he could fire two shots at the sky!

    At this moment, the chief commander suddenly sits up straight. He looks at his watch and shouts: "Ho!"

    Old Zhao is startled and says incoherently: "Oh! It's just 1:40!"

    "Nonsense! Are you possessed? Where is this place? Oh! Old Cow Shoal. It's 5:30 now. It will be eight o'clock before we get to the city. Damn it! Who told you to stop here?"

    Old Zhao says with a guilty conscience: "It broke down!"

    The chief commander sees that the engine hood is covered properly and says: "There's something fishy! If it broke down, why are you standing here twiddling your thumbs waiting for someone to carry you away?"

    Old Zhao regains his usual composure and says: "I just fixed the car and rested for two minutes. Don't you always tell me! Health is the capital of revolution?"

    The chief commander says: "You'll never finish reciting that scripture! Do you know? Twenty or thirty people will be waiting for me in the office at 7:30. Damn it!"

    "As long as you don't damage the car, let's try our best to hurry forward!" Old Zhao puts on his gloves and grabs the steering wheel. With a beep, the car speeds off again…

    The mountains move backwards, the trees move backwards. The darkness gradually recedes, and dawn climbs the mountain peak. A tense and boiling day is welcoming an energetic person again…

    铁路工地上的深夜（小说）
    杜鹏程
    “一位铁路工程局长告诉我：两三年前，整年挣断腰筋才能完的任务，现在以同样的人和设备，四个月就可以有条不紊地完成它。我听了这话很激动。因为我知道路是怎样走过来的。我知道五年计划开始的年月，建设工地的人们怎样奋不顾身地在混乱中摸索前进……”
　——日记摘录
    月光照得山沟如同白昼。地上铺了一层薄薄的霜。树叶在飘飞。
    山根下的公路上，停了一辆吉普车。司机赵玉勤，手塞在裤兜里，斜歪着肩膀靠着车头，凝望对面的工地。帽沿的阴影遮住了他深沉的眼睛。
    老赵身边的大工棚里，拥挤着成百名工地的重要负责人。他们在争论，在叹气，在沉思，在计算……劳动力、材料、计划、生产等等字眼，都围绕着“防寒”这两个字在转。“防寒”这凉冰冰的字眼，从大工棚的窗缝里溜出来，爬在司机老赵的心头，使他熬愁。这倒不是怕天气一冷车子难发动，而是他像那会议室的每个人一样：对这铁路工地上的无数工点都非常熟悉。因而他也知道：如果寒冷提前赶来，会给从事露天作业的铁路职工，带来多大的祸害！
    他看看表，已经两点钟了，可是会议的主持人——被大家称作总指挥的人，还在工棚里用宏亮的声音讲话。
    两点零五分，工棚里传出咳嗽声、哈欠声、板凳的响声和杂乱的说话声。人们从工棚里陆陆续续走出来。他们，都让工地日夜紧张的生活煎熬得脸色黄瘦。有的声音沙哑，有的眼里布满血丝，有的心事重重，有的眉头拧起，肝火挺盛……大伙一出工棚，都不约而同的望望天空，又用脚蹭地上的霜，仿佛希望这地上的霜只是月光造成的错觉。
    最后，总指挥走出来。这是个粗壮的人。左手提个安全帽，穿双草鞋。裤筒挽在膝盖跟前。身上有水泥味，泥土味，柴油味。这不活活的就是个挑土筐
  子的壮工吗？其实，他是工地的最高负责者，指挥着数百个大小单位和十几万职工。……好些人还在工棚门口围着他；请求，诉苦，用夸大的困难威胁他。他把厚敦敦的手举在头上用力摇，一边走一边大笑着说：“嗨嗨！我是穷光蛋。啃我的骨头啃不出多少油水！”“你哭穷？你的仓库里要什么有什么。是个大老财。就算骂祖宗三代，我明天也要把你的炸药调出去十吨！”
    “嘿！月亮挺好呀！”总指挥摆脱了人们的纠缠以后，用指头在引擎盖上愉快地敲着鼓点子。司机老赵想：不妙！他心神不安。
    老赵站在总指挥身后，用力吸了一口气，想说什么，却没有张口。何必空费口舌呢？你说：“不早了，就宿到这儿。”总指挥会用开玩笑的口气说：“没法子！我们这一辈人最遗憾的就是睡眠不足。”
    老赵不声不吭地把夹衣递给总指挥，又双手塞在裤兜里，斜歪着肩膀，靠车子站在那里。
    总指挥望了望老赵那富有暗示性的姿态，说：“四个钟头能赶二百公里，到城里我还可以赶上办件要紧事。要得吗？你还有什么新方案？”
    老赵往车上一坐，抓住方向盘，眼睛直盯前方，说：“天天都是这个样子，何必商量？”
    “回答得好！”总指挥耸耸肩，笑了笑，坐在司机旁边的座位上。
    嘟的一声，车子开了。
    公路上到处是料石、刚卸下来的钢材、水泥和停在路边准备装东西的大卡车。老赵的车子绕来绕去的行进着。他斜着眼瞅，只见总指挥用手捂着前额，身子随着车子的摇摆而摇摆。他晓得，现在不是说话的时候。总指挥脑子里还装着会场里的情形；一整天在工地遇到的各种问题还压着他，各种印象还包围着他。只有车子跑了二三十公里以后，总指挥会主动找他老赵的。
    果然，汽车跑了不到四十分钟，总指挥仿佛摆脱什么沉重的东西似的，伸了伸懒腰。接着，又用拳打着手掌，望着公路下边闪闪发光的江水，哼着歌儿。哼了一阵，他自言自语地说：“肚子里好像在闹革命！”
    这一阵，别说有什么好吃的，若能叫开老乡的门，把这里出产的地瓜买来几个啃啃，就心满意足了。
    老赵不言不语地一手把住方向盘，一手从坐位旁边一样一样把东西拿出来，放在总指挥怀里：一个军用水壶，里头热烫烫的开水，三个地瓜，两个饼子和二两牛肉。
    总指挥兴奋而感激地望了老赵一眼，就津津有味的嚼着。车子摇晃，开水泼在膝盖上。
    这工夫，正像往常一样：这位首长和这位司机要进行热烈谈话了。首长要谈他一天当中遇到的事和正在思考的事，声音时而欢乐，时而气愤，时而苦恼……而司机也会谈他一天当中的所见所闻。这些凌乱、具体和生动的琐事，常常闪动着重要的思想，又是站在总指挥这个职位上的人听不到也看不见的……可是今天有些异样：总指挥吃完东西没有吭声。
    过了一会，总指挥把头伸出去，望望天空说：“鬼天气！还不到冷的时候，就突然下霜！要是明天温度降到零度，就把命要了！二十多个桥梁工地都正在打混凝土！”
    老赵仿佛没听见；一个更紧张的思想涌上他脑子。他一边开车，一边斜着眼珠看左边——江那边的工地，那里，电灯拉成一条线的地方，是第二工程队在填路基；千万盏电灯连成一片，像个城市似的地方，是五十一号工点。他拚命地把车加快速度，车轮简直离了地，腾空而飞。连总指挥都觉得惊奇。平素，老赵像那些老练的司机一样：当快就快，当慢就慢，不管车上坐着多大的首长，乱发什么指示，他也不改变自己的习惯。
    “要快！”老赵心里有底。五十一号工点是关键工程。这个工点的工程队长前几天就喊叫：“不得了！二十九号十二时以前不运来二百吨水泥，我就要上吊！”这家伙可能在路上挡住总指挥的车子，磨捣好半天。他鬼的很，捉摸到总指挥在工地活动的规律了。可是老赵早从工程处调度室打听得一清二楚：五十一号工点的水泥用到后天十二点，那个乱吵乱嚷的工程队长，不仅不会上吊，还挤眉弄眼地跟工人说笑话。……要想尽法子，不让总指挥在路上耽搁一分一秒。这样，总指挥回到城里还可以休息两个小时。要不，路上一耽搁，到城里正是上班时间。材料厂长，夹一大堆图纸的工程师，上级来的各式各样的检查小组和成百件的指示、信件、电报，都会一齐涌来，把他埋住，连喘气的空都没有……而当他从这风雨不透的包围中冲出来以后，又会喊：“老赵！上现场去！”
    要快！要快！过了这工点集密的地方就好了。可是你说出奇不出奇，目下正好是放炮时间，敲锣声、哨子声、人喊声……车子每走三五公里就让拿红旗的工人挡住了：“危险！不准通行！”车子一停，总指挥就敏捷地跳下去，背着手，望着放炮的山头。那里，一道道蓝色的火光闪耀，接着轰隆隆的响声，震得山摇地动……总指挥激动地来回走着，望着脚下的江水，仿佛要趟过去，跑到对面的工点上，按住这上下千余里的铁路工地，试试大地的脉搏……
    放警戒的工人一宣布：“可以通行！”老赵就连忙发动车子，喊：“首长！赶紧走！”
    “不算慢嘛！照这里进度看，天气不要再冷，有十天工夫我们就——”
    “首长！要赶路啊！”
    总指挥好像突然醒悟过来似的说：“哦！要赶路！”
    汽车又冲过几个重要的工点，老赵扫了总指挥一眼，以为他快睡着了，松了口气，放慢速度。于是，这辆小车子像滑行似的顺着公路忽而在江边驶驰，忽而升到半山腰，忽而绕过山脚，忽而经过已经熟睡的村庄。
    猛然，总指挥敲着挡风玻璃，说：“过了五十四号工点了？停车！”
    老赵佯装糊涂，更加快速度，直向前奔。
    总指挥猛然扭过头，两道透凉冰冷的目光，射到老赵脸上，声音低沉地说：“停车！”
    不敢怠慢！老赵让车子逐渐减低速度，然后才缓悠悠地煞住车。其实，这个拖泥带水的过程，又让车子向前滑动了数百公尺。理由很充足：按部就班，不能违犯操作规程嘛！想发脾气也不中用。
    总指挥头一摆，说：“掉头！返转到五十四号工点。”
    老赵把下巴压在方向盘上，慢腾腾地问：“干嘛去？”
    “囉嗦！难道你不晓得，我答应在今天四时以前，给五十四号工点二百吨钢筋吗？可是……现在说不定他们已经停工待料囉！碰到了鬼哟！”
    老赵不但没有掉转车子，还一直向前开去。他说：“我帮助你记住这件事哩。今日下午，我以你的名义给材料厂厂长挂了个电话：叫他先把材料拨给五十四号工点，回头补手续。”
    总指挥没有表示什么，只用拳头轻轻地打了一下手掌。老赵知道：这是一个最得意的动作。
    车子向前奔跑，带着一股风，进入一条偏僻的山沟。老赵把住方向盘望着前方，公路两旁的小树和枯草上，挂满霜花。大卡车的轮胎，在铺了一层白霜的公路上，划下两条没头没尾的黑带子。偶尔从路边的水沟里，跳出了一只狐子。它站在路当中，拖着尾巴，起劲地扬起头，好奇地面对着汽车强烈的灯光。望了好一阵，便窜到随风摇摆的蒿草中去了。一会儿，一只藏在树林中的兔子被灯光吓得蹦起来，在公路上乱窜。
    老赵偏过头看：总指挥已经睡着了。在这紧张、混乱而沸腾的日子里，老赵看总指挥这样睡觉，已经记不清有多少回了。生活把繁难而沉重的担子放到这样人的肩上，他只能在这汽车的颠簸中，闭闭眼睛，积蓄力量，然后再作勇猛的跃进。老赵尽力使车子平稳，以便总指挥睡得安宁。但是这里有几个材料库，整天成千辆拉材料的汽车、拖拉机、马车和架子车，已经把前后几十公里的高级路面压坏了。在车灯照耀下，公路简直像一条波浪起伏的河流。任凭老赵满头大汗地使尽了他全部本领，车子还是颠簸着。每颠簸一下，总指挥就挪动一
  下，或者肩膀耸动。
    车子一转弯，摆脱了各种吼声日夜不断的工地，进到了一条幽静的山谷。老赵伸头看看周围的地形，又飞快扫了总指挥一眼，闭住气，咬住嘴唇，慢慢地减低了速度，接着神不知鬼不觉地煞住车。他知道，总指挥醒来，他会挨骂。管他的！只要让那成天像马达旋转似的头脑休息一阵，便是世上最当紧的事。
    对面山坡上的村庄里有狗咬声。路边大树上一群小鸟突然?噜噜地飞着，叫着，大概是黄鼠狼钻到鸟窝里去了！瞌睡爬上老赵的眼皮。他直想坐在车旁边的石头上，抱住膝盖好好睡一觉。嘿！这个车子上坐的不是个平常的人，如果从山坡的森林里窜出来几个歹毒的家伙来……他拔出腰里的手枪在车子周围转游，放尖眼睛四处瞅着，谛听着各种响动。这时候，拉材料的大卡车很少了，但是一刻钟左右总有一辆车子经过。老赵的心提到喉咙里了，他生怕那些年轻的司机不知好歹，远远看见这里停辆车子，便拼命按喇叭。可好！飞驰而过的汽车除了带来一阵风之外，都不按喇叭。大约，那些日夜奔忙的司机们也在悠悠忽忽打盹哩！偶尔有几辆拉钢材或木料的马车经过。赶早的人披着被子坐在车上，缩着头，抱着鞭子打盹。驾辕的马哼哧哼哧地信步走着。
    老赵狠狠地揉揉眼，看见总指挥头靠在车门的铁撑子上，睡得挺香。右胳膊在车外边吊着，而且袖子拥上去了。明天这条胳膊一定会因风吹受冻而发疼，而麻木。老赵走过来走过去，脑子转了几十个圈，也不敢惊动总指挥。咦！你们看看：这条胳膊又粗又壮，你试试把耳朵贴在上边，准能听到血液在血管里奔流激荡的响声。还有，那胳膊上并排摆着的三个伤疤，在月光下看得多么清楚。其实，那泥巴点点的衣服，还遮盖着更多的伤疤哩……但是这一切都是遥远的事情了。最让人关心的是，总指挥睡得很甜。看！月光清冷苍白的光线，也不能改变那脸上的生气勃勃的颜色。那张脸很粗糙，可是宽阔、结实、刚毅和勇武。突然那巨大的鼻孔煽动，粗粗地喘息了几声；眉毛抖动了几下，全身骨节都在作响。大概这永远开朗愉快的总在鼓舞别人的人，只有在睡梦中，才让疲劳征服了！只有在睡梦中，才显出他平素怎样苛刻地挤出了自己的每一点汗水和心血……老赵手腕的表，?！?！?地响着。他脚在地下敲着点子，数着时间的步法。时间啊，你以为你飞快的步子，总在把人世间的一切事物都带得团团转，把总指挥带动得团团转；你以为你能带来生命，也能让人头发发白……可是，老赵却从你手里给总指挥夺来了安逸的睡眠，……
    突然，一辆大卡车从远处来了，喇叭按得挺起劲。好像那个倒楣的司机在天明要完成二十万公里的安全行驶，然后去领取奖金似的。
    老赵脸色铁青，恨不得朝天空放他两枪！
    这工夫，总指挥突然直起身子。一看表，就喊：“嗬！”
    老赵吃了一惊，前言不搭后语地说：“哦！刚好是一点零四十分！”
    “鬼话！你中邪啦？这是什么地方？哦！老牛滩。现在五点半了。八点才到城里。倒楣的家伙！谁要你停在这里？”
    老赵心虚口松地说：“抛锚了！”
    总指挥看见引擎盖盖得好好的，就说：“有鬼！抛锚了，你统着手站在这儿等谁背你走？”
    老赵恢复了他平素的镇静，说：“刚把车收拾好，休息了两分钟。你不是经常给我叮咛！身体是革命的资本吗？”
    总指挥说：“你要念上那本经，永远念不完！知道吗？七点半就有一二十个人在办公室等我。该死！”
    “只要不损坏车子，就尽力往前赶吧！”老赵戴好手套，把住方向盘。嘟的一声，汽车又飞奔开了……
    山往后移，树往后移。黑夜渐渐消退着，黎明爬上了山顶。一个紧张而沸腾的日子，又在迎接着精力无穷的人……
