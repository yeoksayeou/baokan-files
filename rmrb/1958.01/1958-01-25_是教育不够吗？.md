Excerpts from School Newspapers:

    Is Education Insufficient?
    Li Guangyao, Yang Xinquan

    Some people believe that young students become rightists because the Party's education is insufficient. It's as if the Party is responsible for rightists becoming rightists. This is simply absurd.

    The Party has always cared for and educated young people, entrusting the future to them and hoping they will become builders of socialism and communism. But some young people are simply not "up to par," insisting on becoming rightists and opposing the Party. What can be done about that? For rightists, the issue is not whether they are educated or not, but the reactionary class toxins in their bones and the extreme development of individualism. It is not surprising that if we look at the core members of the rightists who are frantically attacking the Party and the people this time, many of them were the targets of the democratic revolution and socialist revolution, the "disgraced heroes" who were struggled against in the Five Great Movements and Three Great Transformations, or their family members and relatives who were suppressed, then we can roughly judge. The rightists among ordinary young people are mostly from exploiting-class families, and many are filial sons and grandsons of these "disgraced heroes." They have class hatred towards the Party and the state. Is this merely an educational problem for these people? Absolutely not. Some rightists are not from exploiting-class families, but their minds are filled with the individualistic ideas of the exploiting classes. The continued development of this kind of thinking, until it becomes rotten and reactionary, is what makes them rightists. Therefore, the degeneration of these people is not because the Party's education is insufficient, but because they reject the Party's education, a natural result of the development of individualism.

    If rightists are unwilling to abandon their reactionary stance, then any education from the Party is useless, even though the Party is conducting political and ideological education on them at every moment. The Party has absolutely no obligation to be responsible to the enemy. The Party is absolutely not responsible for this group of so-called "young rightists." The Party is only responsible to the people, and leads the people to wage a resolute struggle against the rightists, and hopes that they will bow their heads and confess their crimes, accept transformation, and suddenly repent.

    是教育不够吗？
    李光耀　杨新泉
    有些人认为青年学生成为右派分子是因为党教育的不够。好像说右派分子所以成为右派分子，党也要负责任。这简直是怪论。
    党始终关怀着青年，教育着青年。把未来交给他们，希望他们成为社会主义和共产主义的建设者。但偏有些青年不“争气”，偏要成为右派分子，偏要反党，那又有什么办法呢？对右派来说，问题不是什么教育与否的问题，问题是他们骨子中的反动阶级的毒素和个人主义的极端发展。说来也不奇怪，我们只要看这次向党、向人民猖狂进攻的右派的骨干分子，有很多是民主革命、社会主义革命斗争的对象，是五大运动、三大改造中被斗争过的“落魄英雄”或者是他们的家属、亲友被镇压，就可大体判明。而一般的青年中的右派分子，也大多是剥削阶级家庭出身，很多是这些“落魄英雄”的孝子，孝孙。他们对党和国家有着阶级的仇恨，难道，对这些人是教育问题吗？绝不。有些右派分子，不是剥削阶级家庭出身，但是剥削阶级的个人主义思想，充满了他们的脑袋。而这种思想继续的发展，一直到腐臭反动的地步，遂成为右派。因此，这些人的堕落不是党的教育不够，而是他们拒绝党的教育，个人主义发展的必然结果。
    右派分子如果不愿意抛弃反动的立场，那么党的任何教育都是没有用的，虽然党每时每刻都在对他们进行政治思想教育。党绝对没有向敌人负责任的义务。党也绝对不负这批所谓“青年右派分子”的责任。党只有向人民负责，而领导人民同右派作坚决的斗争，并且希望他们低头认罪，接受改造，幡然悔悟。
