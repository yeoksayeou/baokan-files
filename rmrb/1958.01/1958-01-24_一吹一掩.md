　　A Blow and a Cover-Up
　　TASS revealed on the 21st the United States' plot to establish rocket bases in the Middle East. The U.S. State Department, with a guilty conscience, hastily issued a statement, stubbornly claiming that the Soviet Union's accusation was "completely fabricated."
　　On the same day, however, Ryan, a news analyst for the Associated Press, gleefully boasted: "Establishing rocket bases in the Middle East would greatly benefit the United States militarily in the future." It is hard to believe that Ryan's argument has nothing to do with the intentions of the Washington authorities. The contradiction arose, apparently, because the U.S. State Department was too eager to deny its war-mongering conspiracy and thus forgot to instruct its propaganda machine to unify its tone; Ryan was too eager to promote the "strength" policy and thus forgot to whitewash his masters.

    一吹一掩
    塔斯社21日揭露了美国企图在中东建立火箭基地的阴谋。做贼心虚的美国国务院急忙发表了声明，硬说苏联的指责是“完全捏造的”。
    就在同一天，美联社的新闻分析员瑞安却兴高采烈地吹嘘：“在中东建立火箭基地会在未来的若干时期内使军事形势大大有利于美国。”很难认为瑞安的论调同华盛顿当局的意图是毫无关系的。矛盾之所以发生，显然是由于美国国务院急于抵赖它的好战阴谋，因而忘了指示它的宣传机器统一步调；瑞安急于鼓吹“实力”政策，因而忘了给他的主子涂脂抹粉。
