Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 9th: The Pingdingshan No. 1 Mine, which is under construction, has modified its original design and improved construction methods, achieving more coal production with less investment.

The No. 1 vertical shaft was originally a large mine with a foreign design and an annual output of two million tons. The project was large, equipment needed to be ordered from abroad, and it would take one year of preparation and four years of construction before coal could be produced. Now, based on the country's coal shortage and permissible geological conditions, it has been changed to one 1.5 million-ton vertical shaft and two 300,000-ton small vertical shafts. In this way, because the small shaft projects are simple and progress is fast, the two small shafts can produce coal in a year and a half, and the large shaft will also be completed more than a year ahead of the original design. Mechanical equipment can be supplied domestically, and investment is saved by 17% compared to the original design.

    大井改小井又省又快
    平顶山一号矿设计修改得好
    据新华社郑州9日电　兴建中的平顶山一号矿井修改原设计和改进施工方法，作到了少投资多出煤。
    一号竖井原是国外设计的、年产二百万吨的大矿井，工程大，设备需要向国外订货，并且需要一年准备四年施工的时间才能出煤。现在，根据国家缺煤和地质条件许可的情况，改成为一个一百五十万吨的竖井和两个三十万吨的小竖井。这样，由于小井工程简单、进度快，两个小井一年半以后即可出煤，大井也比原设计提前一年多，机械设备国内可以自行供给，并且比原设计节约投资17％。
