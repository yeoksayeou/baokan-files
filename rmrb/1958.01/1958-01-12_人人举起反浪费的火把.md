Everyone Raises the Torch of Anti-Waste
    Wan Xiangxin

In the recent rectification movement, the broad masses have already raised the torch of anti-waste. The news published in today's newspaper about the Beijing State-owned No. 3 Cotton Mill, the families of employees in the Hedong District of Tianjin, and the Wuhan Urban Construction Design Institute opposing waste and practicing thrift illustrates that not only production workers have thrown themselves into the fight against waste, but also the families of employees. Not only have employees within the unit launched a fierce attack on waste, but related units have also launched a side attack on waste. These are all exciting things.

To expose and burn away all kinds of waste, it requires everyone to take action and launch a high tide of airing views. Only such a mass movement can uncover and plug the loopholes of waste in every corner. Only with this kind of mass movement can we change customs and habits, overcome the tendency of some people to be indifferent to waste and not feel any heartache, and universally form a habit of diligence and thrift.

The broad masses warmly support the policy of opposing waste and building the country through diligence and thrift. However, to launch a mass movement against waste, we will still encounter some ideological obstacles, more or less.

Take the example of the Wuhan Urban Construction Design Institute reported in today's newspaper. An important method for them to save money is to carefully study the design task book submitted by the construction unit, and if they find the possibility of reducing construction standards or cutting down on construction projects, they actively discuss with the construction unit to modify the design requirements, striving to save funds for the country. This practice does not seem new. However, some design units are not doing this now. They have another way of doing it, which is: to the requirements of the construction unit, "always be responsive," "however much money you have, I will spend however much for you." When the design task book arrives, they do not carefully study whether there is waste; even if they find some loopholes of waste, they just discuss it privately and that's it.

Why is there this phenomenon? One reason is to save trouble and avoid problems; another reason, it is said, is to "maintain good relations" with the construction unit. Indeed, this approach is the easiest and most convenient, and it will also create a "harmonious" relationship with the construction unit. Unfortunately: national construction will therefore lose an opportunity to plug waste loopholes, and a valuable sum of money will be wasted for nothing.

Opposing waste and building the country through diligence and thrift is an important guarantee for building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and it is also the urgent demand of the people of the whole country. It is the responsibility and obligation of all personnel on the economic front to earnestly implement this policy. Here, the spirit of "not shirking responsibility" and "acting bravely for a just cause" is exactly what is needed; other difficulties, troubles, "taking care of relationships," etc., should not be given too much consideration.

In the current struggle to expose waste through extensive airing of views and big-character posters, and in the actions of practicing thrift, all departments and all personnel need to give play to this high degree of responsibility and the spirit of "acting bravely for a just cause."

If everyone holds this attitude and resolutely fights against wasteful behavior, what wasteful phenomenon cannot be eliminated?

    人人举起反浪费的火把
    万向辛
    最近一个期间的整风运动中，广大群众已经举起了反浪费的火把。今天本报发表的北京国棉三厂、天津河东区职工家属和武汉城市建筑设计院反对浪费、厉行节约的消息说明：目前已经投入反浪费斗争的不仅有生产工人，而且有职工家属；不仅本单位职工已在向浪费现象发起猛攻，有关单位也已经向浪费的现象发起了侧面的袭击。这些都是令人兴奋的事情。
    要把各方面的浪费现象揭发出来，烧个干净，需要人人动手，掀起一个鸣放高潮。只有这种群众性的运动，才能发掘出和堵塞住各个角落的浪费漏洞；有了这种群众性的运动，才能移风易俗，克服一部分人对浪费现象熟视无睹、毫不心痛的倾向，普遍形成勤俭节约的风气。
    广大群众是热烈拥护反对浪费、勤俭建国的方针的。但是，要掀起一个反浪费的群众性的运动，也还会或多或少地碰到一些思想障碍。
    拿今天本报报道的武汉城市建筑设计院的例子来看。他们节约的一个重要办法是仔细研究建设单位提出的设计任务书，发现有降低建筑标准或者削减工程项目的可能，就积极同建设单位商量修改设计要求，力争为国家节约资金。这种作法看起来并不新奇。但是，现在有些设计单位却没有这样作。他们有另外一种作法，这就是：对建设单位的要求“有求必应”、“你有多少钱，我就给你花多少钱”。设计任务书来了，不去仔细研究有没有浪费现象；即使发现了一些浪费的漏洞，也只是私下议论一番了事。
    为什么会有这种现象？一个原因是图省事，怕麻烦；另外一个原因，据说是为了同建设单位“搞好关系”。的确，采取这种办法是最省事最方便的，也会同建设单位搞得“一团和气”。可惜的是：国家建设将会因此失掉一个堵塞浪费漏洞的机会，一笔宝贵的资金将会白白浪费。
    反对浪费、勤俭建国，是多快好省地建设社会主义的重要保证，也是全国人民的迫切要求。切实贯彻这一方针，是经济战线所有人员的责任和义务。在这里，正用得着“当仁不让”、“见义勇为”的精神；对其他什么困难、麻烦、“照顾关系”等等，都不应该作过多的考虑。
    在目前通过大鸣大放大字报揭发浪费现象的斗争中，在厉行节约的行动中，所有部门、所有人员都需要发挥这种高度的责任心和“见义勇为”的精神。
    人人都抱着这种态度，坚决地向浪费行为作斗争，还有什么浪费的现象不能够消除呢？
