Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 1st: The representatives of nearly fifty countries from Asia and Africa concluded their seven-day conference in Cairo today, and issued a letter to the people of the world, reaffirming the Asian-African people's commitment to the ten principles adopted at the Bandung Conference in April 1955.

The declaration was read by the Chairman of the Conference, Sadat, at a mass meeting held at Cairo University's main auditorium at 4:15 PM. The mass meeting was attended by observers and diplomatic envoys from many countries, as well as many Arab and African students. The students' enthusiastic cheers repeatedly interrupted the declaration and other speeches. They frequently chanted slogans such as "Long live Asian-African solidarity!" "Down with imperialism!" and "We demand peace!"

When Mrs. Rameshvari Nehru, head of the Indian delegation and Chairman of the Asian Solidarity Committee, stood up to speak on behalf of all the delegates, the entire hall erupted in stormy applause. She said that this conference was "a powerful manifestation of the desire for freedom that beats in the hearts of the people of both continents." She pointed out that even the major Western newspapers recognized the importance of this conference.

She said, "The will of the people is the ultimate force, and using this force for just and good causes will always achieve victory. I have no doubt that the united voice of the 1.7 billion people who sent representatives to this conference is something that people will not, and cannot, ignore."

She called on the Asian and African people to maintain unity. She said that united, they would have no fear and would certainly achieve victory.

Finally, she expressed her gratitude to the Egyptian Asian-African Solidarity Committee and its chairman and staff, whose hard work made the conference a success. She also praised the Egyptian government and President Nasser. She said that President Nasser's full spiritual support for this people's movement, his wisdom, his brilliance, and his concern for the common desire to elevate all of Asia and Africa to equality with the rest of humanity, have been undoubtedly proven.

In his farewell address to the delegates, Anwar Sadat said that the resolutions adopted by the conference would be "a source of hope and inspiration for years to come, a torch illuminating the path to prosperity for our hundreds of millions of descendants, whether they are those who are working hard to consolidate and strengthen the freedom and independence they have already gained, or those who are still struggling to achieve this freedom."

Sadat also said that the participants of this historic conference support everything that contains the meaning of cooperation and liberation, and condemn everything that contains oppression, exploitation, and coercion.

The Secretary-General of the conference, Siba'i, then invited the heads of the delegations from dependent countries and regions—including Algeria, Kenya, Cyprus, Italian Somaliland, Oman, Cameroon, Uganda, French Somaliland, British Somaliland, Togo, Zanzibar, Palestine, and Chad—to come to the stage. As they stood on the stage below the emblem of Asian-African solidarity amidst warm applause and slogans of support, Siba'i reiterated the conference's support for them and wished them success in their struggles.

The conference closed at 5:00 PM amidst very warm cheers.

On their way in and out of the conference hall, the delegates were warmly cheered and applauded by hundreds of students and workers who had come from all over the country especially for the conference. They held banners with slogans demanding peace, condemning imperialism and "Eisenhower Doctrine," and supporting the struggles of the people of all countries for independence.

Countless residents of the Egyptian capital stood on the streets to bid farewell to the nearly fifty Asian and African countries' representatives who would soon be returning to their respective countries.

That evening, President Nasser held a reception at Abidin Palace to entertain all the delegates attending the conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 1st: The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held its last plenary meeting at 11:00 AM on January 1st, where it read and unanimously adopted the resolutions drafted by the five committees on political, economic, cultural, social, and organizational matters.

The resolutions passed by the meeting included: resolutions on the issue of imperialism, appeals to the United Nations, appeals to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom regarding the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing, appeals to scientists of all countries, disarmament and the elimination of the threat of atomic war, the Algerian question, the Palestinian question, the issue of racial discrimination, economic issues, and social issues.

This plenary meeting ended at 2:00 PM. The closing ceremony was scheduled to be held at 4:15 PM that day in the main auditorium of Cairo University.

Before the resolutions drafted by the five committees were passed, only the Tunisian delegation had raised an objection, suggesting that the passage on the "Eisenhower Doctrine" be removed from the resolution on the issue of imperialism. When the chairman of the meeting read out this amendment, the entire venue, especially the representatives of Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somaliland, and other countries, strongly opposed the amendment and vehemently criticized the "Eisenhower Doctrine." In this situation, a representative of the Tunisian delegation took the stage and said that he accepted the opinions of the delegates and agreed to include the passage on the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the resolution on the issue of imperialism. At this time, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause, and the resolution condemning the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was unanimously adopted.

When the Chinese representative passed the resolution on culture, he made a statement saying that the People's Republic of China had not yet restored its due legitimate status in the United Nations, so the Chinese delegation was not bound by Article 3 of the resolution on culture. This clause stipulates that a book should be written to describe the cultural contributions and resources of the Asian and African people, especially the disasters that colonialism brought to the Asian and African people and their struggle for freedom. The resolution said: "This book should be written in accordance with the principles of writing history as stated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, in order to strengthen the kinship between human beings." The statement of the Chinese delegation was supported by all the representatives.

    反殖民主义斗争获得新的发展
    亚非人民团结大会胜利闭幕
    谴责帝国主义、艾森豪威尔主义和巴格达条约，支持各民族争取独立的斗争；要求裁军和消除原子战争威胁；号召亚非人民互相帮助
    新华社开罗1日电　亚非两洲近五十个国家的代表今天下午结束了他们在开罗举行的历时七天的大会，并且发表告世界人民书，重申亚非人民信守1955年4月万隆会议所通过的十项原则。
    宣言是由大会主席萨达特在四时十五分在开罗大学大礼堂举行的群众大会上宣读的。参加这次群众大会的有许多国家的观察员、外交使节，以及许多阿拉伯和非洲的学生。这些学生的热情的欢呼声一再打断了宣言和其他讲话。他们不时欢呼“亚非团结万岁！”“打倒帝国主义！”“我们要求和平！”等口号。
    当印度代表团团长、亚洲团结委员会主席拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人代表全体代表起立发言的时候，全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声。她说，这次大会“是在两洲人民心中跳动的要求自由的愿望的强有力的表现”。她指出，甚至西方的主要报纸都承认这次大会的重要意义。
    她说，“人民的意志是最后的力量，把这种力量用来从事正义、善良的事业总是会取得胜利的。我毫不怀疑，派代表参加这次大会的十七亿人民的一致呼声，是人们不会、也不能加以忽视的。”
    她号召亚非人民保持团结。她说，团结起来，他们就可以不必有任何恐惧，而且肯定会获得胜利。
    最后，她表示感谢埃及亚非团结委员会以及它的主席和全体人员，他们的辛勤的工作使大会获得了成功。她还赞扬了埃及政府和纳赛尔总统。她说，纳赛尔总统对这次人民运动给以充分的精神上的支持，他的智慧、英明以及对希望把整个亚非提高到同人类其余部分平等的地位这一共同愿望的关切，已经毫无疑问地得到了证明。
    安瓦尔·萨达特在向代表们致告别词的时候说，大会所通过的决议在今后若干年将成为“希望和鼓舞的源泉，将成为照亮我们亿万子孙的繁荣的道路的火炬，无论他们是那些正在为巩固和加强自己已经获得的自由和独立而努力工作的人，还是那些尚在为实现这种自由而斗争的人”。
    萨达特又说，这次有历史意义的大会的参加者支持一切包含着合作和解放意义的事物，谴责一切包含着压迫、剥削和强制的事物。
    大会秘书长西巴伊然后邀请参加大会的阿尔及利亚、怯尼亚、塞浦路斯、意属索马里兰、阿曼、喀麦隆、乌干达、法属索马里兰、英属索马里兰、多哥、桑给巴尔、巴勒斯坦和乍得——等附属国和地方的代表团团长走上主席台。当他们在热烈的掌声和表示支持他们的口号声中站在主席台上亚非团结的会徽下面的时候，西巴伊向他们重申，大会支持他们，并且祝他们在斗争中获得成功。
    大会在十分热烈的欢呼声中在下午五时闭幕。
    在代表们进出会议大厅的路上，受到了为了这次大会特别从全国各地赶来的数以百计的学生和工人的热烈欢呼和鼓掌欢迎。他们拿着旗帜，上面写着要求和平、谴责帝国主义和“艾森豪威尔主义”、支持各国人民争取独立的斗争的字样。
    埃及首都的无数居民站在街道两旁，向不久就要回到他们各自的国家去的将近五十个亚非国家的代表们告别。
    当天晚上，纳赛尔总统在阿比丁宫举行晚会，招待参加大会的全体代表。
    新华社开罗1日电　亚非人民团结大会在1日上午十一时举行最后一次全体会议，会上宣读并且一致通过了政治、经济、文化、社会和组织五个委员会起草的决议。
    会议通过的决议有：关于帝国主义问题，向联合国的呼吁，向苏联、美国和英国政府关于禁止核武器试验的呼吁，向一切国家的科学家的呼吁，裁军和消除原子战争威胁，阿尔及利亚问题，巴勒斯坦问题，种族歧视问题，经济问题和社会问题等决议。
    这次全体会议在下午两点结束。闭幕式预定当天下午四时十五分在开罗大学大礼堂举行。
    在五个委员会草拟的决议通过以前，只有突尼斯代表团曾经提出异议，建议去掉帝国主义问题的决议中关于“艾森豪威尔主义”那段话。当会议主席宣读这项修正案时，整个会场特别是约旦、伊拉克、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、利比亚和索马里兰以及其它国家的代表都坚决反对这项修正案，并且猛烈抨击“艾森豪威尔主义”。在这种情况下，突尼斯代表团的一位代表便登台发言，说他接受代表们的意见，同意在帝国主义问题的决议中把关于“艾森豪威尔主义”那段话包括进去。这时整个会场响起了雷动的掌声，并且一致通过了谴责“艾森豪威尔主义”的决议。
    中国代表在通过关于文化的决议的时候发表声明说，中华人民共和国还没有在联合国恢复自己应有的合法地位，因此中国代表团不受关于文化的决议第三条的约束。这一条款规定要编写一本书，叙述亚非人民的文化贡献和资源，特别是殖民主义带给亚非人民的灾难和他们争取自由的斗争。决议说：“这本书应该按照联合国教育、科学及文化组织所说的关于编写历史的原则进行编写，以便加强人类彼此之间的血亲关系。”中国代表团的声明得到了全体代表的支持。
