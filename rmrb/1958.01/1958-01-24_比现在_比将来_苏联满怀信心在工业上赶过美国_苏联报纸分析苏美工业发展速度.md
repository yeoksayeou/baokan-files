Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd -- A recent article in the Soviet "Industrial Economics Newspaper" said that the Soviet Union would be able to rank first in Europe in terms of per capita industrial output in about six or seven years. In terms of total industrial output, the Soviet Union had already surpassed all European capitalist countries before World War II.

Nikonova said that the Soviet Union has now caught up with the United States in terms of per capita output of several industrial products such as peat, nickel, chromium, manganese, combine harvesters, and sugar. It will also catch up with the United States in the next few years in terms of per capita output of coal, iron ore, woolen fabrics, and cement. Other important industrial products will require a longer time to catch up with and surpass the United States in this respect.

Nikonova pointed out that, considering the population comparison between the Soviet Union and the United States, in order to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita industrial output, the Soviet Union must exceed the United States by 20% in total industrial output. Since the industrial development speed of the Soviet Union is much faster than that of the United States, this goal is entirely achievable.

The author exemplified that from 1947 to 1957, Soviet industrial production increased year by year, with an average annual increase of 15.9%, while during the same period, the industrial production level in the United States was extremely unstable, with large fluctuations, and the average annual increase was less than 5%.

The article pointed out that the very rapid industrial development speed has enabled Soviet industrial production to rapidly approach the level of the United States. This can be seen even from the comparison of the output of some of the most important industrial products between the Soviet Union and the United States in the past three years. For example, in 1955, the Soviet Union's coal mining volume was 80% of that of the United States, 88% in 1956, and 97% in 1957. In the above three years, the Soviet Union's steel output was 42%, 47%, and 48% of the United States respectively, iron ore output was 67%, 80%, and 83% of the United States respectively, and woolen fabric output was 89%, 90%, and 105% of the United States respectively. The Soviet Union's woolen fabric output has caught up with and surpassed the United States.

Nikonova said that according to calculations, the Soviet Union will be able to surpass the current level of the United States in the most important industrial products within the next fifteen years. Compared with the 1957 production level of various industrial products in the United States, by 1972, the Soviet Union's coal output will be 36% to 57% more than the United States, electricity will be 12% to 26% more, oil will be equal to 99% to 114% of the United States, iron ore will be 1.4 times to nearly 2 times more, steel output will be equal to 94% to 113% of the United States, cement will be 80% to 1.2 times more, woolen fabrics will be one to 1.4 times more, and shoes will be equal to or 17% more than the United States. By then, the Soviet Union will rank first in the world in terms of total industrial output.

    苏联满怀信心在工业上赶过美国
    苏联报纸分析苏美工业发展速度
    据新华社莫斯科23日电　苏联“工业经济报”最近发表的一篇文章说，苏联大约再过六、七年就可以在按人口平均计算的工业产量方面跃居欧洲第一位。就工业总产量来说，苏联还在第二次世界大战前就已经超过了欧洲所有资本主义国家。
    尼科诺娃说，苏联现在在泥炭、镍、铬、锰、联合机、糖等几种工业产品按人口计算的产量上已经赶上了美国；在按人口计算的煤、铁矿、毛织品和水泥的产量上也将在最近几年内赶上美国；其他若干重要工业产品还需要较长的时间才能在这方面赶上和超过美国。
    尼科诺娃指出，从苏美两国人口的对比情况来看，为了在按人口计算的工业产量方面赶上美国，苏联必须在工业总产量上超过美国20％。由于苏联工业发展速度大大快于美国，这一目标是完全可以达到的。
    作者举例说，在1947年到1957年间，苏联工业生产年年都在增加，每年平均增加15.9％，而同一时期美国各年的工业生产水平却极不稳定，上下波动很大，每年平均增加额还不到5％。
    文章指出，非常快的工业发展速度使得苏联工业生产迅速地接近美国的水平。即使是从最近三年来苏美两国某些最重要的工业品产量的比较中也可以看出这一点。例如，1955年，苏联的采煤量为美国的80％，1956年为88％，而1957年已经达到97％。在上述三年中，苏联的钢产量先后为美国的42％、47％和48％，铁矿砂产量先后为美国的67％、80％和83％，毛织品产量先后为美国的89％、90％和105％。苏联的毛织品产量已经赶上和超过了美国。
    尼科诺娃说，据计算，苏联在今后十五年内在最重要的工业产品上就能够超过美国目前的水平。和1957年美国各种工业品生产水平比较，到1972年，苏联煤产量将比美国多36％到57％，电力将多12％到26％，石油将等于美国的99％到114％，铁矿砂将多一点四倍到将近二倍，钢产量将等于美国的94％到113％，水泥将多80％到一点二倍，毛织品将多一倍到一点四倍以上，鞋将等于美国的水平或者比它多17％。到那时候，苏联在工业总产量方面将居于世界第一位。
