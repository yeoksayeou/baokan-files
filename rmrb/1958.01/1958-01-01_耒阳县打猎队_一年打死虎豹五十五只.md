Leiyang County Hunting Team
    Kills Fifty-Five Tigers and Leopards in One Year

    (Our dispatch) The thirteen hunting teams of Leiyang County, Hunan Province, eliminated more than 25,000 harmful beasts last year, including fifty-five tigers and leopards.

    The famous Chen Qifang Hunting Team, last year, organized the entire team to search the mountains for hunting, tracking tiger dens, and traveled through the deep mountains and dense forests of several counties including Leiyang, Anren, Yongxing, and Chen County, killing twenty-eight tigers. In the area of ​​Gao Ling Fei Jiang Majia Ao in Leiyang County, where wild animals often appear, they eliminated twenty-three wild boars and five wild cattle. In the past, this was a mountainous area with serious animal damage. Now, due to several hunts by the hunting team, the phenomenon of wild boars and wild cattle damaging crops has been greatly reduced. In 1952, the Longshan area, which suffered the most serious tiger disasters, had more than seventy people bitten to death or injured, and countless chickens and dogs were harmed. Farmers did not dare to go out to work during the day. Now, the mountain gullies in this area are planted with lush green crops, and the safety of human and animal production has been guaranteed.

    Last year, the Leiyang County Hunting Team sold more than 10,000 various animal skins to the supply and marketing cooperatives, and sold a large number of tiger bones to the pharmaceutical company. The value of these special products totaled more than 60,000 yuan.

    Now, the hunting teams in Leiyang County have established joint defense organizations and prepared various medicines and machinery to fully carry out hunting activities in the winter and spring seasons.

    耒阳县打猎队
    一年打死虎豹五十五只
    本报讯　湖南省耒阳县十三个打猎队，去年消灭了各种害兽两万五千多头，其中包括五十五只老虎和豹子。
    著名的陈耆芳打猎队，去年组织全队人马，搜山打猎，虎穴追踪，曾走遍了耒阳、安仁、永兴、郴县等几个县的深山密林，捕杀了二十八只老虎。在耒阳县高岭淝江马家?一带野兽经常出没的地方，消灭了二十三只野猪，五头野牛。过去这里是兽害严重的山区，现在由于打猎队的几次追捕，野猪、野牛破坏农作物的现象，已经大大减少。1952年虎患最严重的龙山一带，曾有七十多人被咬死咬伤，鸡犬被伤害无数，农民白天都不敢出门生产。现在这一带的山沟里都种满绿油油的作物，人畜生产安全得到了保障。
    去年耒阳县打猎队卖给供销合作社各种兽皮一万多张，卖给药材公司大批虎骨，这些特产价值共达六万元以上。
    现在耒阳县各个打猎队已成立了联防组织，准备了各种药械，在冬春季全面开展打猎活动。
