    Returning to the Village to Produce
    By Our Correspondent Gu Ye
    Duan Fangming had just put down his luggage when several of the commune's key cadres stepped into his home.

    "We've been looking forward to your return. What would you like to do?"

    "I'll do whatever the commune assigns me."

    "Go dig the canal then."

    The next day, Duan Fangming appeared in the ranks of those digging the several-li-long flood drainage canal. The commune director, Yan Yuansheng, watched him shoveling earth, one shovelful after another. He was sweating profusely but refused to take a break. The director was overjoyed: Fangming can still work hard. When I saw him yesterday, I was a little worried: he's been working outside for five years, he might not be able to handle bending over. I didn't expect that the first cadre our commune welcomed back to participate in production would be able to both bend over and get to work the second day he returned home. Thinking of this, the commune director couldn't help but say loudly:

    "Fangming, are you trying to dig a canal with two shovelfuls? You've just come back, work a little slower, get your body in shape before you work so hard."

    "Don't worry! I still have some fire in me."

    After the canal was completed, Fangming was assigned to herd livestock. At that time, spring planting was nearing completion, and fodder was almost exhausted. The commune divided more than sixty livestock in half and assigned Fangming to lead three commune members to graze them. Fangming had herded livestock before. Accepting this task, he took the livestock to live in the mountains forty li away for a month. The mules and horses, which were skin and bones when they left, returned sleek and strong.

    After returning from grazing, he participated in grass cutting, continuing until the autumn harvest. The regulation was to cut 120 jin of grass per work day, but he could cut more than 140 jin a day, and the soil on the grass was shaken off. He said that if the soil was shaken off the grass, the livestock would love to eat it.

    By the time of the autumn harvest, he had only been home for six months, but he had already worked 162 work days. Now he is a breeder, taking care of the livestock meticulously. The commune never had a good stockman before, and Fangming just filled this gap. Originally, people didn't know how to pad saddles, and the backs of 80% of the livestock were worn out. Fangming re-leveled the cotton pads under the saddles one by one, and the livestock's back sores gradually healed, and their backs were no longer worn out, and they all grew strong.

    Now, in the Qiligou Village Agricultural Cooperative in Wutai County, Shanxi Province, everyone praises Duan Fangming as a good example!

    "Fangming, how do you have so much energy no matter what you do?" The villagers asked him with respect. He said:

    "Have you seen the changes in our hometown? Our Qiligou was burned down by the Japanese devils, and the little bit of precious land in the river滩 was also washed away by torrential rains and mountain floods. I've only been away for a few years, and the village has changed greatly. The poor gully has gradually become a rich gully. Now there are rows of houses, and embankments have been built on the river滩. The willows on the embankments have grown to be a person tall. Since the winter of 1955, the villagers have controlled two large mountains, reducing soil erosion, and the crops in the fields can now be guaranteed. These changes in our hometown make people smile from ear to ear. But when I see it, I really regret it: why didn't I come back a few years earlier and shed a few drops of sweat to change the face of my hometown? Villagers, because I have contributed too little, I always feel like I haven't done enough when I work."

    When the commune director heard Fangming say this, the moving scene of those old people and women participating in controlling the barren mountains, building dams, and digging pits to conserve water and soil appeared before his eyes. He said: "Our commune needs people like Fangming! We wouldn't mind if the higher authorities sent another five hundred people. We've been controlling the mountains of Qiligou for two years and three months, and we've only controlled a quarter of them. Now the state has decided to send a large number of cadres who 'climb glass boards' to lower levels. It doesn't matter if the organs have fewer cadres, but it's remarkable to have a few more people in our mountain village!"

    回乡生产
    本报记者　顾页
    段放明刚放下背上的铺盖卷儿，社里的几个主要干部就跨进了他的家门。
    “可把你盼回来了。你愿意干个啥呀？”
    “社里分配我干啥，我就干啥。”
    “开渠去吧。”
    次日，在挖掘那条数里长的洪水渠的队伍里，出现了段放明。社主任阎元生瞧见他一锹连一锹地铲土，累得汗流满面还不肯歇一歇，心里乐极啦：这放明还能干呢。昨儿见了他，我有点不放心：他出外工作五年，弯腰恐怕吃不消了，没想到咱社迎来的第一个回乡参加生产的干部，一能弯腰干活，二是回家第二天就参加劳动。想到这里，社主任忍不住大声说：
    “放明，你想两锹挖出个渠来吗？才回来，干得慢些，把身体打熬出来再卖劲干吧。”
    “不怕！我还有些火劲儿。”
    渠修完了，放明又被派去放青。当时春耕播种接近煞尾，饲草已快完了，社里把六十几个牲畜分了一半给放明，让他领着三个社员去放牧。放明从前是赶过牲口的，接受了这个任务，把牲畜?喝到四十里以外的山间居住了一个月，那群离去时是瘦骨突露的骡马，归来时便满身平滑光腻，膘肥体壮。
    放牧回来，他又参加割草，一直割到秋收。一个劳动日规定要割草一百二十斤，他一天能割一百四十多斤，而且草上的泥土都被抖掉了，他说，抖掉了草上的泥土，牲畜才爱吃。
    到秋收为止，他回家才六个月，却已经作了一百六十二个劳动日。现在他又当了饲养员，把牲畜服侍得妥妥贴贴。从前社里没有一个看牲口的好把式，放明恰恰补了这个缺。原来人们不会垫鞍子，把80％的牲口的背磨坏了，放明把鞍子下的棉垫一一重新整平，牲畜的背疮渐渐养好了，再没见磨坏了背，都长得挺壮的。
    如今在山西省五台县七里沟村农业社里，谁不言传这段放明是个好样儿的！
    “放明，你怎么无论干啥都有使不完的劲呀？”乡亲们怀着敬意，这样问他。他说：
    “你们看见了家乡的变化没？咱这七里沟，遭日本鬼子烧光过，河滩里那点宝地，也被暴雨山洪冲塌过。我出去才几年，村里就大变了，穷沟渐渐变成了富沟，现在房屋一片片，河滩垒起了堤坝，堤上的杨柳长到一人高，乡亲们从1955年冬天起治了两架大山，水土流失现象减少了，地里的庄稼已能保收。家乡这些变化，叫人看了不能不乐得眉开眼笑。可是我看了呀，心里着实懊悔啊：为什么我不早几年回来，也为改变故乡的面貌淌几颗汗珠？乡亲们，就因为我出力太少，所以干起活来，总觉着干得不够似的。”
    社主任听放明说这，眼前浮现出了那些老人和妇女参加治理荒山，筑坝挖坑，保持水土的动人图景，他说：“咱社需要放明这种人！上级再派来五百名，咱也不嫌多。咱七里沟的大山，治了两年零三个月，才治了四分之一呢。现在国家决定把爬玻璃板的干部大批下放，机关少几个干部不打紧，咱这山村多几个人呀，可就了不起！”
