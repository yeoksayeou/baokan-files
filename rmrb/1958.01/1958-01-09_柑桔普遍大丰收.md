　　Citrus Fruits Achieve Widespread Bumper Harvest
　　(Our report) In 1957, citrus fruits achieved a widespread bumper harvest in various regions. Zhejiang Province's total citrus fruit output increased by approximately 30% compared to 1956, Fujian Province by approximately 10%, Guangdong Province by approximately 9.5%, and Jiangxi Province by approximately 7%. In Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan and other provinces, different types of large-scale high-yield models emerged. Bumper harvest counties, bumper harvest townships, and bumper harvest cooperatives were everywhere.
　　In 1956, Huangyan County, Zhejiang, suffered a reduction in citrus fruit production due to insect pests, and the masses' confidence in improving citrus fruit production decreased. In 1957, political and ideological work was strengthened, and slogans such as "Welcome the bumper harvest of 1957, turn a lean year into a good year, support national industrialization, and strive for an income of 500 yuan, 700 yuan, or 900 yuan per household" were put forward. This reversed the mood of fear of difficulties among cadres and the masses. Management of citrus orchards was promptly strengthened. More than 20,000 mu of citrus orchards in the county achieved a high yield of more than 2,600 jin per mu on average, an increase of 136% compared to 1956. In Huijiang Agricultural Cooperative, Xiaoyou Township, the 200 mu of citrus orchards created a high yield of more than 4,200 jin per mu. Within the cooperative, there were 15 mu of high-yield orchards with an average yield of more than 8,000 jin per mu, and 50 mu with an average of 6,000 to 8,000 jin. In Sanhu Township, Xingan County, Jiangxi, the entire township's more than 5,000 mu of citrus orchards produced more than 110,000 dan of citrus fruits, an increase of 91.16% compared to the early days of liberation and 37.5% compared to the highest pre-war output. In the Friendship Fruit Farmers Cooperative of Longxi County, Fujian, although 1957 was a lean year for citrus fruits, management was strengthened, and the average yield per mu of the cooperative's more than 700 mu of citrus orchards was more than 2,400 jin. The highest yield per unit area reached more than 10,300 jin.

    柑桔普遍大丰收
    本报讯　1957年度各地柑桔普遍丰收，浙江省柑桔总产量约比1956年度增产30％，福建省约增产10％，广东省约增产9.5％，江西省约增产7％。在广东、福建、浙江、江西、湖南等省均出现了不同类型的大面积丰产典型。柑桔丰产县，丰产乡，丰产社处处可见。
    浙江黄岩县1956年度因虫灾柑桔减产，群众对搞好柑桔生产的信心降低了。1957年加强了政治思想工作，提出“迎接1957年大丰收，将小年变大年，支援国家工业化，争取每户收入五百元，七百元，九百元”等口号。扭转了干部和群众的畏难情绪。及时加强了柑桔园的管理。全县二万多亩桔园获得平均每亩二千六百多斤的高额产量，比1956年增产136％。该县孝友乡汇江农业社在二百亩桔园里创造了每亩四千二百多斤的高额产量，社内丰产园平均每亩产量八千斤以上的有十五亩，平均六千至八千斤的有五十亩。江西新干县三湖乡全乡五千余亩桔园产柑桔十一万多担，比解放初期增产91.16％，比战前最高产量增产37.5％。福建龙溪县友谊果农社的柑桔，1957年度虽系小年因加强了管理，全社七百多亩柑桔园每亩平均产桔二千四百多斤。其中最高的单位面积产量达一万零三百多斤。
