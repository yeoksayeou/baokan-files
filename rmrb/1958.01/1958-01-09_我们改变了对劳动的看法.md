Letters from Cadres Sent to Lower Levels

    We Have Changed Our View of Labor

    We are cadres from the Xingping Machinery Factory who have been sent to lower levels. Since participating in agricultural production, our attitude towards labor has undergone great changes in terms of our thoughts and feelings.

    In the past, we also said we were willing to be sons of the working people. However, once we actually came into contact with the working people, we would unconsciously develop a kind of unnatural expression. For example, sometimes we wanted to shake hands with them, but when we saw that their clothes were covered in dust, we didn't know why our hands wouldn't reach out. Now that we have participated in labor ourselves, and our bodies are often covered in dust and our hands have become rough, we feel very close to the working people, talking and laughing freely, without any unnatural expressions.

    In the past, we also said, "Every grain of rice and every drop of gruel comes with difficulty." However, when we ate, we didn't feel any pain when we threw away a little bit of leftovers. After coming here, the corn buns we eat contain our own labor, so we not only feel that they are very fragrant and sweet, but we also truly understand the principle that "every grain of rice and every drop of gruel comes with difficulty." We pick up and eat any corn kernels that happen to fall, and we carefully save any leftovers from each meal. This has allowed us to develop good habits of thrift in many small aspects of life. In the past, we lived in buildings, and we still complained that the heating wasn't warm enough, and that the electric lights weren't bright enough, and some comrades complained all day long. Now, we kneel on our knees and write on the bed, and no one complains anymore. These are all the influences given by the education of actual labor and the thrifty qualities of the peasants.

专栏：下放干部的来信

    我们改变了对劳动的看法
    我们是兴平机械厂的下放干部。我们参加农业生产以后，对待劳动从思想感情上发生了很大变化。
    过去，我们也说愿意做一个劳动人民的儿子。但是，一旦真正和劳动人民接触，便又会不自觉地产生一种不自然的神情。比如，有时我们要想和他们握手，但一看见他们穿的衣服沾满灰尘，手便不知怎的伸不出去了。现在，我们自己参加了劳动，身上也常常盖满灰土，我们的手也变得粗糙了，这样，再和劳动人民在一起，就觉得很亲切，谈笑自如，没有不自然的神情了。
    过去，我们也说“一粥一饭来之不易”。但是，我们吃起饭来，剩下一点扔掉，也不觉得心痛。来这里以后，我们吃的玉米窝头，由于里面有我们自己的劳动，吃起来不仅觉得很香甜，而且也真正懂得了“一粥一饭来之不易”的道理，偶而掉下的玉米粒拾起来吃掉，每餐吃剩的也都小心地收藏起来。这就使我们在许多生活小节问题上养成了节俭的好习惯。过去，我们住在楼房里，烧着暖气还嫌不暖，亮着电灯还嫌光线不好，有的同志整天发牢骚。现在，垫着膝盖伏在床上写字，谁也没有怨言了。这些都是实际劳动的教育和农民勤俭品质所给予的影响。  李建新　邢凤翔　马锦山　邓英俊
