Moscow's Construction Scale is Huge This Year: Large-Scale Housing Construction and Increasingly Improved Urban Transportation

(Our Moscow dispatch, January 11th) Moscow's large-scale urban construction plan for this year has been determined, with a total urban construction expenditure of 6.85 billion rubles for the year. Moscow will be built even more beautifully this year.

A major measure in Moscow's urban construction this year is to vigorously build housing. The residential building area this year will reach 2.33 million square meters, an increase of 520,000 square meters compared to last year. In addition to continuing to build high-rise residential buildings in large numbers in the newly built southwest district, large-scale housing construction will be carried out in the suburban areas of Cheryomushki, Fili, and Mnevniki. The new projects will also include 42 schools, 11 cinemas, a panoramic cinema with 1,500 seats, and many factory workshops, hospitals, nurseries, etc.

Urban transportation construction is improving daily. The two subway lines leading to Moscow State University on Lenin Hills and the Exhibition of National Economy Achievements will be fully opened to traffic in May. In addition, several new line projects will also commence construction. Moscow's surface public transportation will be further improved, and trams on many streets will be converted into trolleybuses or buses. Currently, there are nearly 5,000 public transportation vehicles (excluding taxis) providing services day and night throughout the city, and 700 new-style buses will be added this year.

The supply of goods in Moscow's urban areas is expanding. One hundred and ten new stores will be opened this year. Plans have also been made to further green the city. Children's playgrounds are being opened in various parks within the city. This year, 7 million rubles will be used in these places to prepare new public toys for children. (Attached picture)
