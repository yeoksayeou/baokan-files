Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, January 17th: The Central Committee of the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party, at its meeting held from January 11th to 13th, adopted two resolutions supporting the two declarations issued in Moscow last November—the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Manifesto of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries.

    The full text of these two resolutions was published in "Al-Nour" on the 17th.

    Resolution on the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries

    The resolution of the Central Committee of the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party on the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries includes two parts: Our Era is the Era of Socialism and the Era of the Demise of Imperialism; The Victory of Socialism.

    Based on the declaration's analysis of the current international situation, the resolution discusses the growth of the socialist camp's strength and the weakening of the imperialist camp, elaborates on the great achievements of socialist countries, and provides a detailed explanation of the declaration.

    The resolution states that the Central Committee of the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party "fully supports this historically significant declaration and is fully confident that this resolution expresses the sentiments of our people."

    The resolution states: "Without a doubt, Syrian and Lebanese communists and all nationalists who have carefully studied the declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties will find in this declaration new guiding lights in the arduous national struggle of our people against imperialism to defend their independence, sovereignty, and freedom."

    The resolution particularly emphasizes the declaration regarding war or coexistence, the communist movement and national liberation movements, the basic laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction, national fronts, and the issue of forms of transition to socialism. It also emphasizes gratitude to socialist countries for their noble stance towards the cause of Arab countries against imperialism, especially towards Egypt and Syria.

        Resolution on the Peace Manifesto

    The resolution passed by the Central Committee of the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party on the Peace Manifesto of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries states that the Central Committee fully agrees with this manifesto. The resolution states that a delegation headed by the Party's General Secretary, Khaled Bagdash, represented the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party at the meeting.

    The resolution states that this manifesto expresses the hopes of people of all countries, of different colors and religions, with different ideas and thoughts, and is a sincere call for all benevolent forces to cooperate in efforts to support world peace and save humanity from the disaster of nuclear war, which imperialists and the tyrants of the dollar are attempting to launch.

    The resolution states that this historic document clearly proves that the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries regard the defense of world peace as their primary task.

    The resolution states that the Central Committee believes that the struggle of the Syrian and Lebanese people, along with all Arab people, against imperialism and against military treaties (such as the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine), cannot be separated from the great struggle of all mankind to safeguard and consolidate peace. Syria, regardless of the plots hatched by U.S. imperialism one after another, regardless of the threat of direct imperialist armed aggression, adheres to its policy of national independence and liberation, and Syria and Egypt, two free Arab sister countries, united to defend this policy, have made a great contribution to the cause of world peace.

    The resolution points out that the threat of war still exists. War preparations have become a feature of the policies of imperialist countries, especially the United States. However, warmongers are becoming increasingly isolated both domestically and internationally, and the forces of peace are growing day by day. The Soviet Union's superiority in science and the achievements of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference are sufficient proof of this.

    The resolution finally calls on the Syrian and Lebanese communists to redouble their efforts, cooperate with people of goodwill, regardless of their religion or belief, to mobilize the strength of the entire nation to engage in the struggle for mankind to achieve coexistence, disarmament, a ban on nuclear weapons, a ban on the establishment of missile bases in Arab and other countries, and to use all scientific atomic and hydrogen energy for peaceful purposes.

            Implementing an Arab National Liberation Policy in Lebanon

    "Al-Nour" published on the 16th another resolution passed by the Central Committee of the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party—the resolution "Implementing an Arab National Liberation Policy in Lebanon." The resolution states that the unrest, unease, and instability within Lebanon have intensified, and the Lebanese people are increasingly recognizing and understanding that this disastrous situation is the inevitable consequence of participating in bloc politics, which has linked Lebanon with U.S. imperialism and bound Lebanon with the Eisenhower Doctrine in order to make Lebanon a U.S. military base.

    The resolution calls on the Lebanese people to struggle for a national liberation policy, which will achieve the following goals: 1. Save Lebanon's independence and sovereignty; 2. Lebanon maintains neutrality; 3. Abandon the policy of participating in blocs, do not accept the Eisenhower Doctrine, and reject U.S. conditional aid; 4. Reject military blocs and other aggressive blocs, unite and fully cooperate with Syria and Egypt, and end the policy of hostility towards free Arab countries; 5. Respect Lebanon's democratic freedoms.

    The resolution points out that this is the only way to get Lebanon out of its current tragic situation.

    Speaking about the domestic situation in Lebanon, the resolution states that the shameful policy has greatly deteriorated the domestic situation. Bribery, corruption, and embezzlement of public funds are very serious, scandals are rampant, religious hatred has formed, massacres have occurred, temporary arrest laws have been formulated, and hundreds of people have been imprisoned, the people's living conditions have deteriorated, the national industry is in a critical situation, and a campaign to suppress national newspapers has been carried out. The resolution states that all of this is part of the consequences of accepting the Eisenhower Doctrine and following U.S. imperialism.

    The resolution states that Lebanon's current policy makes it a center for imperialist conspiracies against Syria and Egypt. The resolution points out that an even worse consequence of accepting the Eisenhower Doctrine is hostility towards all socialist countries, while the Soviet Union is Lebanon's best friend and the greatest defender of world peace and national freedom.

    The resolution states that U.S. aid is only at the cost of our independence. On the contrary, the unconditional aid given by the Soviet Union to Syria and Egypt will help the two countries build industries, increase their production capacity, and raise the living standards of the two countries.

    The resolution points out that the Lebanese Foreign Minister, Charles Malik, not only did not take action to expand commercial relations with socialist countries, but instead signed an agreement with Chiang Kai-shek, a pawn of the United States, and severed relations with the People's China, which imported seven million Lebanese pounds of Lebanese products in 1957.

    The resolution states that the only way to achieve a national liberation policy is to strengthen the unity between all the Lebanese people on the basis of expanding and strengthening the national front.

    The resolution concludes by saying that communists stand at the forefront of those who work for the national front. Communists must continue to strive for unity, fight to crush the Eisenhower Doctrine, save Lebanon's independence, restore fraternal friendly relations with free Arab countries, and participate in the work of defending world peace.

    叙利亚——黎巴嫩共产党中央决议指出
    莫斯科宣言指明阿拉伯民族的道路
    号召黎巴嫩人民进行斗争挽救国家独立
    据新华社大马士革17日电　叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会在1月11日到13日举行的会议上通过两项决议，支持去年11月在莫斯科发表的两个宣言——社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言、各国共产党和工人党的和平宣言。
    “光明报”17日刊载了这两项决议的全文。
    关于社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言的决议
    叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会关于社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言的决议包括两个部分：我们的时代是社会主义的时代和帝国主义灭亡的时代；社会主义的胜利。
    决议根据这个宣言对现阶段国际形势的分析，论述了社会主义阵营力量的增长和帝国主义阵营的削弱，阐述了社会主义国家所取得的伟大成就，并且对这个宣言作了详细解释。
    决议说，叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会“完全支持这个具有历史意义的宣言，同时充分相信，这个决议表达了我国人民的情绪”。
    决议说：“毫无疑问，叙利亚和黎巴嫩的共产党人和所有仔细研究过共产党和工人党宣言的民族主义者，都会在这个宣言中找到在我国人民对帝国主义进行的保卫他们的独立主权和自由的艰苦民族斗争中指导他们前进的新的路灯。”
    决议特别着重指出这个宣言关于战争或共处、共产主义运动和民族解放运动、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的基本规律、民族阵线和关于向社会主义过渡的形式问题。它还强调感谢社会主义国家对于阿拉伯国家反对帝国主义的事业、特别是对于埃及和叙利亚所采取的崇高立场。
        关于和平宣言的决议
    叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会就各国共产党和工人党的和平宣言通过的决议说，中央委员会完全赞同这个宣言。决议说，以党的总书记哈立德·巴格达什为首的代表团曾经代表叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党参加这次会议。
    决议说，这个宣言表达了有不同肤色和宗教，不同观念和思想的各国人民的希望，并且是要求一切善良的力量进行合作来努力设法支持世界和平、使人类避免核战争灾难的真诚的召唤，这种核战争是帝国主义和美元的暴君正在企图发动的。
    决议说，这个历史性的文件清楚地证明，各国共产党和工人党是把保卫世界和平当作它们的首要任务的。
    决议说，中央委员会认为，叙利亚和黎巴嫩人民同所有阿拉伯人民一起经历的反对帝国主义、反对军事条约（如巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义）的斗争，是不能和全人类为了维护和巩固和平的巨大斗争分割开来的。叙利亚不顾美帝国主义所策划的一个接一个的阴谋，不顾帝国主义直接武装侵略的威胁，而坚持它的民族独立和解放政策，以及叙利亚和埃及这两个自由的阿拉伯姐妹国家团结一致保卫这种政策，对世界和平事业作出了巨大的贡献。
    决议指出，战争的威胁仍然存在。备战成为帝国主义国家特别是美国的政策的特色。但是战争贩子们在他们自己国内和国际上愈来愈孤立，和平力量正在一天天地增长。苏联在科学方面的优势和亚非人民团结大会的成就都足以证明这点。
    决议最后要求叙利亚和黎巴嫩的共产党员加倍努力，同具有善良意愿的人民合作，不管他们的宗教和信仰如何，以动员全民的力量投入人类为了实现共处、裁军、禁止核武器、禁止在阿拉伯和其他国家建立导弹基地以及把所有科学上的原子能和氢能用于和平目的而进行的斗争。
            在黎巴嫩实行阿拉伯民族解放政策
    “光明报”16日刊载了叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会通过的另一项决议——“在黎巴嫩实行阿拉伯民族解放政策”的决议。决议说，黎巴嫩境内的骚乱、不安和不稳定的局势已经加剧，黎巴嫩人民日益认识并且理解到这种灾难性的局势是参加集团政策的必然后果，这种政策使黎巴嫩同美帝国主义发生了联系并且用艾森豪威尔主义来束缚黎巴嫩，以便使黎巴嫩成为美国的军事基地。
    决议号召黎巴嫩人民为民族解放政策进行斗争，这个政策将实现以下几个目标：一、挽救黎巴嫩的独立和主权；二、黎巴嫩保持中立；三、放弃参加集团的政策，不接受艾森豪威尔主义，拒绝美国的有条件的援助；四、拒绝军事集团和其他侵略性集团，同叙利亚和埃及两国团结和进行充分的合作，结束仇视阿拉伯自由国家的政策；五、尊重黎巴嫩的民主自由。
    决议指出，这是可以使黎巴嫩摆脱它目前悲惨局势的唯一办法。
    决议在谈到黎巴嫩国内局势的时候说，可耻的政策使国内局势大大恶化。贿赂、贪污和盗用公款的行为非常严重，丑事百出，宗教仇恨形成了，屠杀事件发生了，制定了临时的逮捕法并且囚禁了数以百计的人们，人民的生活条件更加恶劣，民族工业情况危急，进行了压制民族报纸的运动。决议说，所有这一切是接受艾森豪威尔主义和追随美帝国主义的后果的一部分。
    决议说，黎巴嫩目前的政策使它成为帝国主义对叙利亚和埃及进行阴谋活动的中心。决议指出，接受艾森豪威尔主义的更糟糕的后果就是仇视一切社会主义国家，而苏联是黎巴嫩的最好的朋友，并且是世界和平和民族自由的最伟大的保卫者。
    决议说，美国的援助只是我们的独立的代价。相反，苏联给叙利亚和埃及两国的无条件援助将帮助两国建设工业，增加它们的生产能力和提高两国的生活水平。
    决议指出，黎巴嫩外交部长夏尔·马利克不但没有采取行动来扩大同社会主义国家的商业关系，相反，他同美国的走狗蒋介石签订了协定，并且同人民中国断绝了关系，而人民中国在1957年进口了七百万黎巴嫩镑的黎巴嫩产品。
    决议说，实现民族解放政策的唯一办法就是在扩大和加强民族阵线的基础上加强黎巴嫩全体人民之间的团结。
    决议最后说，共产党人站在那些为民族阵线而工作的人们的前列。共产党人必须继续争取实现团结，为粉碎艾森豪威尔主义而斗争，挽救黎巴嫩的独立，恢复同阿拉伯自由国家的兄弟般的友好关系，并且参加保卫世界和平的工作。
