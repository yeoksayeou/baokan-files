    Let Us Greet the New Year
    Duan Xuefu

    1957 was a year that will forever be unforgettable!

    In 1957, the international and domestic socialist cause was further consolidated and developed. The two declarations from Moscow concentratedly demonstrated the sincere unity of socialist countries and the great power of peace-loving people around the world. The domestic anti-rightist struggle achieved a great victory, and the rectification campaign has also brought a new atmosphere to our work. In the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, socialist construction has made great achievements. The East Wind prevailed over the West Wind, the dark clouds were blown away, and the sun shone on the earth. I believe that in 1958, the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, at this new turning point in the wheels of history, the international and domestic socialist cause and the cause of defending peace will all achieve new and great developments.

    In 1957, the Soviet Union's two man-made satellites went into space, while the American "Vanguard" only went "putt," this contrast exposed the illusion of America's scientific and technological supremacy in the world, and also proved the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system in developing science and technology. In the forty years since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union started from an economic and cultural level far behind that of the United States and experienced an extremely cruel war of defense on its own soil, and yet it has achieved its current successes. The speed of development is extremely astonishing; the reason for success is by no means accidental, but can only be the inevitable result of the full development of the wisdom and strength of the working people and intellectuals under a socialist system that has eliminated exploitation. If the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea cured the "fear of America" disease, then "Sputnik" cleared away the remaining poison of "worshiping America." The rightists' frantic attacks on the basic policy of learning from the Soviet Union in higher education and scientific research have also been completely shattered. I believe that in 1958, steadfastly learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and combining it with our specific realities will enable our higher education and scientific research undertakings to develop healthily and vigorously along the socialist path.

    Our goal of socialist construction is to build our country into a strong socialist country with a modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Three more five-year plans will bring our industrial production level up to or beyond that of Great Britain. The implementation of the twelve-year National Agricultural Development Program will bring our agricultural production level up to and even exceed the targets of four hundred, five hundred, and eight hundred catties. The implementation of the twelve-year Science and Technology Development Plan will enable our science and technology to catch up with international levels in some of the most important areas. We are confident that we can achieve these targets. In the sports world, Zheng Fengrong's jump broke the world record. This is not an accident, but only the inevitable result of the improvement of people's lives, the improvement of physical fitness, the development of mass sports, and the advanced technical guidance under China's socialist system. Some time ago, I met with Academician Rényi, Director of the Hungarian Mathematical Institute, who said that judging from the development of mathematics in the Soviet Union, the contributions of Chinese mathematicians will be even greater in a few years. This is encouragement from international friends, but I also believe it will be true. Socialist China will certainly cultivate more and higher-level scientists in the future.

    After the Party put forward the slogan of marching towards science, scientists and young students have been aroused with high enthusiasm, and scientific work has been greatly developed in one year. I believe that in 1958, with the formulation of annual implementation plans and the implementation of Sino-Soviet scientific cooperation projects, our research undertakings will have further development. Strengthening the Party's leadership in scientific research and strengthening the socialist collectivist spirit of scientists will be the guarantee for the development of our scientific undertakings.

    In 1957, after the anti-rightist struggle, I further realized the necessity and importance of ideological remolding of intellectuals. Not to mention old intellectuals like myself, even young students from bourgeois and petty-bourgeois families must be vigorously remolded. "Bourgeois intellectual" and "petty-bourgeois intellectual" are like "tightening hoops" on the head; without "rebirth" for remolding, one cannot get rid of this disgraceful hat, and of course, one cannot cross the threshold of socialism. In addition to class nature, I also realized some of the shortcomings brought about by the work of intellectuals themselves. Because intellectuals have long engaged in mainly individual mental labor, if there is no correct ideological understanding, it is very easy to "forget the roots" of physical labor, which is the foundation of mental labor, and it is also very easy to become detached from the masses, thereby easily belittling the working people and fostering corrupt individualism. The significance of cadres going to the countryside for training and remolding lies in establishing a "labor viewpoint" and a "mass viewpoint" and thereby establishing a working-class stand. The class composition, political quality, and ideological remolding of intellectual cadres and young students must be given the utmost importance. The lessons given to us by the anti-rightist struggle, such as "drinking poison to quench thirst" and "adding wings to a tiger," are too profound! Building a socialist society must rely on cadres who are loyal to the people's cause and have a high degree of ideological awareness. Experts who are "only proficient but not red" are of no benefit to the people's cause. Regardless of the political and ideological situation of the trainees, training only from a purely professional point of view will result in "talents" that cannot be handed over to the people, and hard work will also be a great waste.

    Based on the above understanding, in 1958, I will better understand the class line in the national cadre policy and the educational policy of opening the door to workers and peasants, and implement them in my work; under the leadership of the Party, together with other scientists and teachers, I will cultivate "both red and expert" cadres for the motherland. At the same time, I am also determined to overcome personal consciousness, improve ideological awareness, overcome subjectivism, strengthen the mass viewpoint, overcome sentimentalism, actively participate in the struggle between the two lines in higher education and scientific research work, and transform myself into a working-class intellectual. Strive to join the Party's ranks as soon as possible and dedicate myself unreservedly to the Party and the people's great socialist cause.

    我们来迎接新的一年
    段学复
    1957年是令人永难忘怀的一年！
    在1957年，国际的和国内的社会主义事业都更加巩固和发展了。莫斯科的两个宣言，集中表现了社会主义国家的精诚团结和全世界劳动人民爱好和平的伟大力量。国内反右派斗争取得了巨大的胜利，而整改也已使我们的工作有了新的气象。在苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家，社会主义建设都有很大的成就。东风压倒了西风，乌云吹散了，阳光照耀着大地。我相信，在1958年，在这第二个五年计划的第一年，在这历史车轮来到的新的转折点，国际的和国内的社会主义事业和保卫和平事业都将获得新的大的发展。
    在1957年，苏联的两个人造卫星上了天，而美国的“先锋”却只是“叭塌”一下，这个对比揭穿了美国科学技术世界第一的假象，也证明了社会主义制度对发展科学技术的无比优越性。十月革命四十年来，苏联从远比美国落后的经济和文化的水平起始，且在本土上经历了极残酷的卫国战争，而达到现在的成就，发展的速度是极其惊人的；成功的原因决不是偶然的，而只能是在消灭了剥削的社会主义制度下，劳动人民和知识分子的智慧和力量得到了充分发挥的必然结果。如果说，抗美援朝的胜利治愈了“恐美”病，那么，“斯普脱尼克”就清除了“崇美”的余毒。右派分子在高等教育和科学研究方面对学习苏联这一个基本方针的猖狂进攻，也就彻底粉碎了。我相信，在1958年，坚定不移地学习苏联先进经验并结合我们的具体实际，将使我们的高等教育和科学研究事业沿着社会主义的道路健康而蓬勃地发展。
    我们的社会主义建设的目标，就是要把我国建成一个社会主义强国，具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化。再有三个五年计划，将使我国的工业生产水平赶上或者超过英国。十二年全国农业发展纲要的实现，将使我们的农业生产水平达到以至于超过四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的指标。十二年科学技术发展远景规划的实施，将使我们的科学技术在一些最主要的方面赶上国际水平。这一些指标，我们都是有信心达到的。在体育界，郑凤荣的一跳打破了世界纪录。这不是什么偶然的现象，这只是在我国社会主义制度下，人民生活改善、体质提高、群众性体育开展和先进的技术指导的必然的结果。前些时候，我会见了匈牙利数学研究所所长瑞尼院士，他说，从苏联数学发展的情势来看，再过些年，中国数学家的贡献将会更大。这是国际友人给我们的鼓励，但我也相信这将是事实。社会主义的中国将来一定会培养出更多的更高水平的科学家。
    党提出向科学进军的口号后，科学家和青年学生都激起了高涨的热情，一年之中科学工作得到了很大的发展。我相信，在1958年，经过年度执行计划的制定，有着中苏科学合作项目的执行，我们的研究事业将有更进一步的发展。加强科学研究方面的党的领导，加强科学家的社会主义集体主义精神，将是使我们科学事业得到发展的保证。
    在1957年，经过了反右派斗争，使我更进一步地认识到，知识分子的思想改造的必要性和重要性。像我这样的旧知识分子固不必说，就是出身于资产阶级和小资产阶级的青年学生也不能不大力改造。“资产阶级知识分子”和“小资产阶级知识分子”就好像套在头上的“紧箍咒”，不“脱胎换骨”来进行改造，就脱不掉这顶不光彩的帽子，当然也就无法跨过社会主义的关。除了阶级本质而外，我也认识到知识分子工作本身带来的一些缺陷。由于知识分子长期进行主要是个体的脑力劳动，如果没有正确的思想认识，非常容易对作为脑力劳动基础的体力劳动“忘本”，也非常容易脱离群众，从而容易轻视劳动人民，并滋长腐朽的个人主义。干部下乡锻炼改造的意义，也就在于建立“劳动观点”、“群众观点”并从而建立起工人阶级立场。对于知识分子干部和青年学生的阶级成分和政治品质及思想改造，是不能不予以最大的重视的。反右派斗争给与我们“饮鸩止渴”、“为虎添翼”的教训，是太深刻了！建设社会主义社会必须依靠忠于人民事业的和有高度思想觉悟的干部，“只专不红”的专家，对于人民事业是没有好处的。不管培养对象的政治思想情况如何，只从纯业务观点来培养，培养出来的“人才”是无法交给人民的，而辛辛苦苦的培养也将是一种最大的浪费。
    基于上面的认识，在1958年，我将对国家干部政策中的阶级路线和向工农开门的教育方针更好地来体会，并在工作中间贯彻执行；在党的领导下，和其他科学家与教师在一起，为祖国培养“又红又专”的干部。同时，我也有决心，克服个人意识，提高思想觉悟，克服主观主义，加强群众观点，克服温情主义，积极参加高等教育和科学研究工作中两条路线的斗争，把自己改造成为一个工人阶级的知识分子。争取早日加入党的队伍，把自己无保留地贡献给党和人民的伟大的社会主义事业。
