(Xinhua News Agency, January 19th) The central state organs, on the basis of general rectification, have decided to further launch an upsurge of in-depth rectification. This upsurge is a crucial step in determining the success or failure of the rectification movement in the central state organs.

The Party Committee of the Central State Organs held its 18th enlarged Party Committee meeting on the afternoons of January 17th and 18th. The meeting decided to take opposition to waste as the first topic of in-depth rectification. It requested all departments of the central state organs, especially industrial, financial and trade, cultural and educational departments, to ignite the fire of anti-waste, burn away all wasteful phenomena that violate the principle of diligence and thrift in national construction, and, through special debates on anti-waste, further enhance the socialist consciousness of cadres, so as to resolutely and conscientiously implement the policy of diligence and thrift in national construction.

At the meeting, Gong Zirong, First Secretary of the Party Committee of the Central State Organs, made a report entitled "Riding the Wind and Waves, Continuing to Advance, and Launching an Upsurge of In-depth Rectification." The meeting discussed the problems and experiences in the current rectification and cadre transfer work, as well as how to welcome the upsurge of in-depth rectification. Finally, Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, spoke at the meeting.

The meeting first reviewed the progress of the current rectification movement in the central state organs. At present, the upsurge of general rectification in the central state organs has passed, and great achievements have been made in the general rectification work, creating extremely favorable conditions for further in-depth rectification. However, the meeting pointed out that this is only a preliminary victory of the rectification movement, and it is far from achieving "depth" and "thoroughness." We must not be complacent because of this. We must see that the rectification of more important and major problems within the central state organs has not been earnestly resolved. We must carry the rectification movement through to the end, start well and finish well, and must not be half-hearted or have any slackening thoughts.

The meeting put forward the central tasks and steps for the current rectification movement in the central state organs: On the basis of general rectification, further launch an upsurge of in-depth rectification, and combine it with debates on dealing with rightist elements. In order to ensure that the steps of the rectification movement in various units can be roughly consistent, most units are required to strive to complete the two special debates on transferring cadres and dealing with rightist elements by the end of January 1958, and a few units must also complete them before mid-February; in February and March, carry out special debates on anti-waste and other topics; in April, enter the fourth stage of the rectification movement, and end the entire rectification movement by the end of May.

The meeting focused on discussing the issue of opposing waste and implementing the policy of diligence and thrift in national construction. The meeting pointed out that it is very necessary to vigorously launch an upsurge of special airing of views and special rectification against waste in all departments of the central state organs, especially industrial, financial and trade, cultural and educational departments, during the stage of in-depth rectification. According to the materials initially exposed in the general rectification, the phenomenon of waste in the business work of various departments of the central state organs is very serious. Among them, the "young master" style of the planning and design departments, the tendency of showing off, extravagance and waste in the organ life, and the situation of some ideologically degenerated and metamorphosed people, who have fostered a sense of old age and officialdom, harming and wasting state property are serious. The emergence of all wasteful phenomena is closely related to the bureaucratic style of leadership and the non-political tendency of neglecting ideological work. Therefore, the meeting believes that if we do not take the opportunity of the rectification movement to ignite a big fire and thoroughly burn away all wasteful phenomena, it will be difficult to thoroughly implement the policy of diligence and thrift in national construction.

Many people pointed out in their speeches at the meeting that it is very necessary to carry out the struggle against waste at present. Many people have decided on the issue of taking the socialist road, but not all of them are very clear about how to take the socialist road. We must use the struggle against waste to give cadres a profound socialist education, so that they can ideologically recognize the policy of diligence and thrift in national construction and more, faster, better, and more economical results. Some members of the Party Committee also proposed that in order to solve the problem ideologically, we must deeply examine which ideas do not conform to the policy of diligence and thrift in national construction, and pay special attention to examining from the leadership's thinking, exposing the serious waste caused by those who "only care about construction and not policies," finding the root cause, and thoroughly correcting it. Representatives of some units talked about that in the general rectification, some have already touched on some anti-waste issues, but they only corrected some wasteful phenomena on a case-by-case basis, and did not solve the problem ideologically, so the correction was not deep or thorough. In the in-depth rectification, we must accept this lesson and launch a great ideological debate against waste.

The meeting also discussed the work of transferring cadres. At present, most units of the central state organs are working hard to transfer cadres. According to statistics as of December 25, 1957, the planned number of personnel to be transferred from sixty units of the central state organs is 40,949, and the number of personnel who have recently been transferred is 10,456. The meeting believes that this time the leaders of various units of the central state organs have relatively great determination and enthusiasm for transferring cadres; in terms of work methods, most units have implemented the mass line work method, organized the masses to air their views freely, and launched a special debate on cadre transfer, so that the majority of cadres in the organs truly recognized the correctness of the Party's cadre policy and received a socialist ideological education.

However, in the central state organs, there are two completely different approaches to the ideological work of cadre transfer: one method is to organize the masses to air their views freely and launch mass debates, and organize cadre transfer on the basis of in-depth ideological work. The other is not to attach importance to organizing debates on cadre transfer, does not recognize the significance of conducting a deep socialist education through debates, and therefore adopts some simple methods. Some only rely on the mobilization report of the leadership, issue a few empty topics from top to bottom, and generally discuss them without linking them with the actual ideological situation of the cadres of the unit. Some avoid difficulties and take the easy way out, unwilling to spend energy and time, and enlighten and guide the masses to fully expose their thoughts by talking about their thoughts, raising questions, and presenting difficulties, and are not good at grasping typical ideological problems and organizing the masses to launch great debates. This latter approach exists in quite a few units of the central state organs, and the meeting demanded that this situation be corrected immediately. Units that have not debated deeply and thoroughly must resolutely make up for the lessons.

Regarding the handling of rightist elements, the meeting emphasized that a major debate should be carried out, and through the debate, a socialist ideological education should be carried out for the cadres. When dealing with rightist elements, we must first distinguish between the enemy and ourselves politically, and then we can distinguish between leniency and strictness organizationally.

The meeting pointed out that in the in-depth rectification, it will also include business policies, organizational structure, improving leadership style, and criticizing some typical figures with serious ideological problems. All organs must make overall arrangements and proceed in a step-by-step manner based on the actual situation.

    中央国家机关决定掀起深入整改高潮
    第一个专题：烧掉一切浪费现象
    本月底争取完成下放干部和处理右派分子的专题辩论
    据新华社19日讯  中央国家机关的整风运动在一般整改的基础上，决定进一步掀起一个深入整改的高潮。这个高潮是决定中央国家机关整风运动成败的关键性的一步。
    中央国家机关党委在1月17日和18日两天的下午，举行了第十八次党委扩大会议，会上决定要以反对浪费作为深入整改的第一个专题，要求中央国家机关各部门，特别是工业、财贸、文教等部门，要燃起反浪费之火，烧掉一切违反勤俭建国方针的浪费现象，并且通过反浪费的专题辩论，进一步提高干部的社会主义觉悟，做到坚决地认真地贯彻勤俭建国的方针。
    会上，中央国家机关党委第一书记龚子荣作了题为“乘风破浪，继续前进，掀起一个深入整改的高潮”的报告。会议对当前整改和下放干部工作中的问题、经验以及如何迎接深入整改高潮等问题进行了讨论。最后，国务院秘书长习仲勋在会上讲了话。
    会议首先检查了当前中央国家机关整风运动的进展情况。目前，中央国家机关一般整改的高潮已经过去，在一般整改工作中所取得的成绩很大，为进一步深入整改创造了极为有利的条件。但是，会上指出，这仅仅是整风运动的初步胜利，离整风运动的“深”“透”还很远，绝不能因此而自满，必须看到在中央国家机关内部更重要的大问题的整改还没有认真解决，必须把整风运动进行到底，善始善终，不能虎头蛇尾，不能有任何松劲思想。
    会上提出了中央国家机关当前整风运动的中心任务和步骤的安排：在一般整改的基础上，进一步掀起一个深入整改的高潮，并结合进行处理右派分子的辩论。为了使各单位整风运动的步调能争取大体上一致，要求多数单位在1958年1月底争取完成下放干部和处理右派分子的两个专题辩论，少数单位也必须在2月中旬以前做完；2月份和3月份进行反浪费及其他专题辩论；4月份进入整风运动的第四阶段，5月底全部结束整风运动。
    会议着重讨论了反对浪费、贯彻勤俭建国方针的问题。会上指出，在中央国家机关所有部门，特别是工业、财贸、文教等部门，在深入整改阶段中有力地掀起一个反浪费的专题鸣放和专题整改的高潮是非常必要的。根据一般整改中初步揭发出的材料来看，中央国家机关各部门在业务工作方面的浪费现象是十分严重的。其中特别是计划设计部门的“大少爷”作风，机关生活方面的摆场面、摆阔气、铺张浪费的倾向，以及一些思想蜕化变质、滋长了暮气和官风的人，损害和浪费国家财产的情况是严重的。而所有浪费现象的产生，都是同领导上的官僚主义和忽视思想工作的非政治倾向有密切关系。因此，会议认为，如不乘整风运动的机会燃起一把大火，把一切浪费现象彻底烧个干净，要彻底贯彻勤俭建国的方针是困难的。
    会上许多人在发言中指出，目前开展反对浪费的斗争是非常必要的。许多人对于走社会主义道路的问题是定了，但是对于如何走社会主义道路的问题，却并不是都很明确的。必须通过反对浪费的斗争，使干部受到一次深刻的社会主义教育，使他们从思想上认识到勤俭建国和多、快、好、省的方针。有的党委委员并且提出，要做到从思想上解决问题，就必须深入地检查有哪些思想不符合勤俭建国的方针，特别要注意从领导思想上去检查，揭发那些“只管建设，不管政策”而形成的严重浪费现象，找出根源，彻底改正。有的单位的代表谈到，在一般整改中，有的已经接触到一些反浪费的问题，但只是就事论事地去纠正一些浪费现象，没有从思想上解决问题，所以改得不深不透。在深入整改中必须接受这个教训，展开反浪费的思想大辩论。
    会议还讨论了下放干部的工作情况。目前中央国家机关的大多数单位正在紧张地进行着下放干部的工作。截至1957年12月25日的统计，中央国家机关六十个单位计划下放的人员计有四万零九百四十九名，最近已经下放了的计有一万零四百五十六名。会议认为，这次中央国家机关各单位领导对下放干部的决心和劲头都是比较大的；在工作方法上，多数单位都贯彻了群众路线的工作方法，组织群众大鸣大放，展开了干部下放的专题辩论，使机关广大干部真正认识到党的干部政策的正确性，受到了一次社会主义的思想教育。
    但是，在中央国家机关中对干部下放的思想工作存在着两种完全不同的作法：一种方法是组织群众大鸣大放，展开群众性的大辩论，在深入的思想工作的基础上，组织干部下放。另一种是不重视组织干部下放的辩论，对通过辩论进行一次深刻的社会主义教育的意义认识不足，因而采取一些简单的作法。有的只单纯依靠领导上的动员报告，自上而下出几个空空洞洞的题目，一般地讨论讨论，没有同本单位干部思想的实际情况联系起来。有的避难就易，不愿花费精力和时间，启发诱导群众用谈思想、提问题、摆困难的方法，充分暴露思想，不善于抓典型的思想问题组织群众展开大辩论。这后一种作法在中央国家机关相当多的单位中是存在的，会议要求立即纠正这种情况，凡是辩论得不深不透的单位，必须坚决地进行补课。
    关于右派分子的处理问题，会议强调要开展一次大辩论，通过辩论，向干部进行一次社会主义思想教育。在处理右派分子时，必须首先在政治上分清敌我，然后才可能在组织上分清宽严。
    会议指出，在深入整改中，还将包括业务方针、组织机构、改进领导作风以及对一些有严重思想问题的典型人物的批判等内容，这些问题，各机关都要根据实际情况，统筹安排，有步骤地进行。
