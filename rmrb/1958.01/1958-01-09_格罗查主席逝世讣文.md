Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 8th: The newspapers here today published an obituary issued by the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of Romania, the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, and the Council of Ministers regarding the death of Chairman Petru Groza. The full text is as follows:

    The outstanding statesman, the loyal son of the Romanian people, our beloved comrade, Chairman of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic, Petru Groza, passed away on the morning of January 7, 1958, after a long and serious illness.

    Dr. Petru Groza devoted his life to the prosperity of the country, to improving the material and cultural living standards of the people, and to the friendship and peace of all nations.

    He loved his motherland and yearned for social equality. As early as twenty-five years ago, he wholeheartedly approached the struggle led by the Romanian Communist Party for the liberation and independence of our country and for the construction of a new socialist Romania. He had a genuine awareness of serving the interests of the people.

    Petru Groza was born on December 7, 1884, in the village of Bacia, Hunedoara County. After graduating from Orăştie High School, he continued his studies in Budapest, Berlin, Leipzig, and other places, and obtained a Doctor of Law degree.

    As a university student, he was an active fighter against national oppression, for national equality, and for the liberation of Transylvania from the oppression of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

    Petru Groza was a representative to the Romanian Constituent Assembly in 1918.

    From 1920 to 1927, he was elected five times as a member of the Romanian Parliament and served as a minister twice. When he realized the reactionary nature of the bourgeois parties that openly opposed the people, he began to oppose these parties and dedicated himself to the cause he and the people yearned for. He was the founder and organizer of the Ploughmen's Front. He knew that the only way to improve the material and cultural living standards of the peasants and all the people was through the joint struggle of workers and peasants under the leadership of the working class. The Ploughmen's Front, headed by Petru Groza, responded to all the calls of the Romanian Communist Party, which were to unite the democratic forces, organize the People's Front, oppose fascism and the lackeys of Hitler's Germany, oppose the anti-Soviet war, overthrow the military dictatorship, and establish an anti-fascist regime. For this, the bourgeois government arrested him in 1943.

    After August 23, 1944, Dr. Petru Groza stood at the forefront of the democratic forces opposing the reactionaries and establishing a democratic country. As a result of the struggle of the masses under the leadership of the Communist Party to establish a people's democratic government, on March 6, 1945, Dr. Petru Groza became the chairman of the first democratic government in our country's history. During his seven years in office, he did much work to implement the Party's policies, to achieve the revolutionary democratic transformation, and to transform and develop our country's economy and build socialism.

    On June 2, 1952, Petru Groza was elected Chairman of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly and faithfully and responsibly completed this work until his death.

    He dedicated all his energy to the cause of socialist construction, which guarantees a bright and happy future for our people. He firmly supported the Workers' Party's policy of equal rights and fraternal cooperation between the Romanian people and all minority nationalities, and fought for its realization.

    He was a loyal friend of the Soviet Union, and he devoted all his efforts to strengthening the fraternal relations between our two countries. He believed that friendship with the Soviet Union could develop our country's economy and culture, improve the living standards of our people, and consolidate our country's independence and national sovereignty. He was proud that our country stood on the side of the socialist camp, because this camp is the strongest defender of peace and progress. He made his own contributions to the unity of the socialist countries led by the Soviet Union and to the development of the fraternal and friendly relations between these countries.

    He was an opponent of imperialist aggressive plans, interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and the preparation of a new world war. He was an active leader and fighter for the implementation of our Party's policy of peace and international cooperation, and the policy of peaceful coexistence among countries. He enjoyed a high reputation and prestige among the people of the world. He did a lot of work for peace and friendship among nations and for social progress. He was a famous intellectual and political activist. He knew the historical role of the working class as the basic force for national development, so he united around the working class and was good at serving our people.

    He had a high degree of national self-esteem, which made him deeply convinced of the creative power of our people and their ability to be masters of their own destiny. The death of Comrade Petru Groza is a great loss to our people.

    In order to express our respect and mourning for him, we should more firmly unite around our Party and government and actively participate in socialist construction and the defense of peace, which is the cause that our Comrade Petru Groza never forgot to fight for.

    He will forever live in the hearts of our people.

    卓越的政治家、罗马尼亚人民的忠实儿子、我们的敬爱的同志、罗马尼亚人民共和国大国民议会主席团主席彼得鲁·格罗查，在长期的重病之后，于1958年1月7日早晨五时逝世了。
    彼得鲁·格罗查博士曾经为争取国家的繁荣，为提高人民的物质和文化生活水平，为各国人民的友谊和和平贡献出了自己的生命。
    他热爱祖国和渴望社会平等，为了我国的解放和独立，为了争取建设新的社会主义的罗马尼亚，早在二十五年以前他就衷心地靠近了罗马尼亚共产党所领导的斗争。他有真正的为人民利益服务的自觉性。
    彼·格罗查在1884年12月7日出生在洪尼多阿拉州的巴奇阿村。他在奥雷什吉埃中学毕业以后，继续到布达佩斯、柏林、来比锡等地求学，并且获得了法学博士学位。
    远在大学生时代，他就是一位反对民族压迫，争取民族平等，争取把德兰斯瓦尼亚从奥匈帝国的压迫下解放出来的积极斗争的战士。
    彼·格罗查在1918年是罗马尼亚立宪会议的代表。
    从1920年到1927年他曾经五次被选为罗马尼亚议会的议员，两次担任部长。当他了解到公开反对人民的资产阶级政党的反动本质时，他开始反对这些政党，并且把自己献给他和人民所渴望的事业。他是农民阵线的创始者和组织者，他知道，要想提高农民和一切人民的物质文化生活水平，只有经过在工人阶级领导下的工农联合斗争才能实现。以彼·格罗查为首的农民阵线，响应了罗马尼亚共产党的一切号召，这些号召是团结民主力量、组织人民阵线、反对法西斯主义和希特勒德国的走狗、反对反苏战争、推翻军事独裁政权，建立反法西斯政权。为此，资产阶级政府在1943年逮捕了他。
    在1944年8月23日以后，彼·格罗查博士站在反对反动派和建立民主国家的民主力量的最前列。由于人民群众在共产党领导下为建立人民民主政府而进行斗争的结果，1945年3月6日彼·格罗查博士担任了我国历史上第一个民主政府的主席，在他任职的七年中，他为实现党的政策、为革命的民主转变、为改造和发展我国经济和建设社会主义作了许多工作。
    1952年6月2日，彼·格罗查当选为大国民议会主席团主席，并且忠诚地、负责地完成了这一工作，直到他逝世时为止。
    他把自己的全部精力贡献给了能保证我国人民有光明幸福的未来的社会主义建设事业。他坚决支持工人党的罗马尼亚人民和各少数民族之间的权利平等和兄弟合作的政策，并为它的实现而斗争。
    他是苏联的忠实的朋友，他用全力来加强我们两国之间的兄弟关系。他认为，和苏联的友谊能够发展我国的经济和文化，能够提高我国人民的生活水平，能够巩固我国的独立和国家主权。他为我国站在社会主义阵营方面感到自豪，因为这一阵营是和平进步的最坚强的维护者。他为以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结和这些国家的兄弟般的友好关系的发展作出了自己的贡献。
    他是帝国主义的侵略计划、干涉别国内政、准备新的世界战争的反对者，他是实现我们党的和平和国际合作政策、各国和平共处政策的积极的领导者和战士。他在世界的人们中享有很高的声誉和威望。他为各国的和平和友谊以及社会进步作了很多工作。他是著名的知识分子和政治活动家。他知道作为国家发展基本力量的工人阶级的历史作用，所以他团结到了工人阶级周围并善于为我国人民服务。
    他有很高的民族自尊心，这使他深信我国人民的创造力量和能够成为自己命运的主人。彼·格罗查同志的逝世是我国人民的重大损失。
    为了对他表示尊敬和悼念，应当更加巩固地团结在我们的党和政府的周围，积极地参加社会主义建设和维护和平，这是我们的彼·格罗查同志没有忘记过为它斗争的事业。
    他将永远活在我国人民的心里。
