Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 29th — Leading cadres at all levels in Macheng County, Hubei Province, have universally taken the lead in participating in agricultural labor, further strengthening their ties with the masses.

Of the 24 members of the Macheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, all but six who remained to work in the offices went to the countryside to cultivate experimental plots; the six committee members who remained in the offices also went to the countryside to help when rural work was intense. Leading cadres of the County People's Committee also spent a lot of time in the countryside, some of whom also cultivated experimental plots. According to statistics, among the eighteen county committee members in charge of rural work, the time spent in the countryside last year was generally around 250 days, with the most reaching 300 days.

Leading cadres at all levels took the lead in participating in almost all major agricultural activities. When drought occurred last year, many cadres and masses were unwilling to organize for drought resistance, saying things like "there will always be rain" and "cotton is tough, even if it dies, we can still harvest half." Therefore, starting with the county party secretary, members of the county committee in charge of rural work and the main leading cadres of the County People's Committee went to the severely drought-stricken areas, on the one hand, mobilizing the masses to fight the drought by calculating the accounts carefully, and on the other hand, taking the lead in operating water wheels, driving the vast number of cadres and masses into action. Last year, when the double-wheeled double-shared plow was being promoted, many people were unwilling to promote it because they did not know how to use it. County Party Secretary Zhao Jinliang learned how to use the double-wheeled double-shared plow himself, plowed in front of everyone to show them, and taught the technology on the spot; leading cadres in various districts and townships followed suit, and as a result, the work of promoting the double-wheeled double-shared plow was quickly launched. After winter began, in order to support the great leap forward in agriculture, the county party committee called on office cadres to participate in manure accumulation. However, some office cadres were ideologically resistant. Therefore, Wu Dejian, the first secretary of the county party committee, took the lead in picking up a manure basket and started accumulating manure. In a few days, he mobilized the vast number of cadres. Now, many district and township leading cadres pay attention to manure accumulation, and some even carry a manure basket when inspecting work in the fields, picking up any fertilizer they find and putting it in the basket, driving the masses to form a high tide of manure accumulation.

Due to the change in leadership style, the situation of holding meetings all day long in the offices has completely changed. Last year, only three county-wide meetings were held, and they were all brief and effective, which was very popular among district and township cadres. Many problems were solved by the county party committee going to the countryside to hold meetings in different areas or on-site meetings. As for the townships, many things were solved by cadres discussing them in the fields while working, and there was very little time spent sitting down for meetings. The masses in Lisheng Township generally reflect that today's cadres have "three lesses and three mores." The three lesses are fewer meetings, fewer empty words, and fewer harsh words; the three mores are more demonstrations, more practical work, and more reasoning.

    会议少　空话少　硬话少  示范多　实干多　说理多
    走出机关，下乡去！
    麻城县的领导干部绝大多数时间都在乡下培育试验田，带头干农活，深入生产领导生产
    新华社武汉29日电　湖北省麻城县各级领导干部普遍带头参加农业劳动以后，进一步加强了同群众的联系。
    在中共麻城县委会的二十四个成员中，除六个留作机关工作外，全都下农村种了试验田；留作机关工作的六个委员在农村工作紧张时也下乡帮助工作。县人民委员会的领导干部下乡的时间也很多，其中有的也种了试验田。据统计，十八个分工领导农村工作的县委委员中，去年在乡下的时间一般有二百五十天左右，最多的达到三百天。
    各级领导干部都带头参加了几乎所有重大的农事活动。去年发生干旱时，曾有不少干部和群众不愿组织起来抗旱，说什么“没有不下雨的天”、“棉花是个铁脚汉，干死了还能收一半”等。于是，从县委书记起，县委分工管农村工作的成员和县人民委员会的主要领导干部，都分赴干旱严重的地区，一面用算细账的办法动员群众抗旱，一面就带头车水，把广大的干部和群众都带动起来了。去年推广双轮双铧犁时，不少群众因不会用而不愿意推广。县委书记赵金良就自己学会使用双轮双铧犁，亲自犁给大家看，现场传授技术；各区、乡的领导干部也跟着这样作，结果很快就把推广双轮双铧犁的工作展开了。入冬以后，为了支援农业大跃进，县委号召机关干部参加积肥。可是，有些机关干部思想不通。于是，县委第一书记吴德简首先拿起粪筐动手积肥。不几天，就把广大干部带动了起来。现在，许多区、乡领导干部都很注意积肥了，有的到田间检查工作时还随带一个粪筐，碰到有肥料就捡到筐内，带动群众形成了积肥高潮。
    由于领导作风的转变，过去那种在机关里成天开会的情况已经完全改变。去年，全县性的会议只开过三次，而且都开得简短有力，很受区、乡干部的欢迎。许多问题，都是县委下乡分片开会或开现场会来解决的。至于在乡里，许多事情都通过干部在田间一面劳动一面商量就解决了，坐下来开会的时候简直少得很。李胜乡群众普遍反映，如今的干部是“三少三多”。三少是会议少，空话少，硬话少；三多是示范多，实干多，说理多。
