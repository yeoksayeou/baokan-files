    From Not Loving Cleanliness to Emphasizing Hygiene
    After the residents of Tudi Miao Shizi in the Lianhu District of Xi'an City held a large-scale debate during the winter hygiene campaign, a movement to eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene is now flourishing in every household. In the past, the residents here paid little attention to hygiene, and mosquitoes and flies were rampant every summer, which greatly affected the health of the residents. Now, the residents' hygiene habits have improved greatly. Not only are every household digging up pupae to eradicate mosquitoes and flies, but they have also established a system of hygiene duty and inspection, which has brought a new look to the hygiene situation.
    "It's your family's turn to be on duty today," resident Jian Qingju handed the hygiene duty roster to her neighbor Miao Xinshuang.

    从不爱清洁到讲究卫生
    西安市莲湖区土地庙什字的居民经过冬季卫生运动大辩论后，目前一个家家户户除四害、讲卫生的运动正在这里蓬勃展开。过去，这里的居民很不讲卫生，每逢夏季蚊蝇乱飞，对居民健康影响很大。现在，居民的卫生习惯有了很大的改进，不仅家家户户都动手挖蛹根除蚊蝇，而且还建立了卫生值日和检查的制度，使卫生面貌为之一新。
    “今天该轮到你家值日了”，居民建清菊把卫生轮流值日牌交给邻居苗馨爽。
