    Southward Journey in the High Tide
                    By Our Staff Reporter Fan Rongkang
    Our socialist construction cause is advancing bravely with the force of a mighty army, revolutionary fervor is filling the whole country, and everywhere is a chorus of leaping forward.
    Friends! Please join the reporter on a journey through the newspapers. The reporter plans to focus on visiting some provinces and cities, using a worn-out pen to try to reflect more of the aspects of industrial production, industrial construction, and transportation, as well as the issues people are considering in these tasks.
    I. Up the Mountains, Up the Dams, Down to the Villages, Down to the Water
          Heavy Pressure
    On the afternoon of January 13, the reporter arrived in Baoding. Heavy snow was falling here, the first snow seen this year. Auspicious snow heralds a good year, a scene of joy. Early the next morning, the streets and alleys were busy sweeping snow, and carts were going into the city to load snow and send it to the countryside. The fields are in need of moisture. The provincial conference of activists in agricultural construction is being held here, with the mobilizing slogan of producing 30 billion catties of grain by 1962, transforming the grain-deficient Hebei into a grain-surplus Hebei, and producing 1.02 billion catties of cotton. Deputy Director Yin of the Hebei Provincial First Industry Department (Heavy Industry Department) told the reporter that he had attended the conference for several days and was deeply moved by the spirit of the agricultural Great Leap Forward.
    "Do you know what the current situation is in the rural areas of Hebei?" Deputy Director Yin said, "The number of people involved in water conservancy projects alone is six to seven million. Including those accumulating fertilizer, the total number reaches over ten million. Such a high tide of agricultural Great Leap Forward has overwhelmed our department, and the order of normal work has been completely disrupted."
    Saying "overwhelmed" may be an exaggeration, but due to the agricultural Great Leap Forward, the pressure on local industry, especially local machinery industry, is indeed very heavy. The province has made a statistic that various places need a total of 270,000 to 280,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery and 330,000 waterwheels, but the current production plan only arranges for more than 85,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery and 200,000 waterwheels. Even so, the raw material problem has not been completely solved; a large part of the irrigation and drainage machinery are gas engines, which are still being trial-produced. What is more problematic is future repair and maintenance. There are currently 5,000 irrigation and drainage power machines in the province. Together with the 20,000 units planned to be sent to the countryside this year, they will be spread all over the province. Without a powerful repair and maintenance network throughout the province that can promptly supply various parts and timely repair and maintain them, the efficiency of these machines cannot be fully utilized.
    It is no wonder that the First Industry Department feels under great pressure.
              Two Ups and Two Downs
    However, what the agricultural Great Leap Forward has proposed to the local industrial departments is not only irrigation and drainage machinery. The agricultural Great Leap Forward requires local industrial departments to comprehensively consider how to serve the rural economy and how to closely integrate with the rural areas. The peasants are now full of vitality. The plains need to be constructed, the mountains need to be constructed, and the low-lying areas also need to be constructed. They need both means of production and means of livelihood, and they want to utilize all kinds of resources. All these are waiting for local industry to cooperate. According to this situation, Hebei local industry has already loudly put forward the slogan of "Two Ups and Two Downs." That is: up the mountains, up the dams, down to the villages, down to the water.
    The mountainous area of Hebei accounts for 45.9% of the province's area. According to preliminary investigation, the resources in the mountains, which can be used for making wine and extracting oil, reach more than 20 kinds. Cocklebur seeds, acorn seeds, Chinese toon seeds, and fruits such as wild grapes and wild pears are everywhere. There are coal, iron, gold, asbestos and other metal and non-metal minerals. However, the current industry in the mountainous area is extremely weak. In the Second Industry Department (Light Industry Department) system, there are only forty-six enterprises in the mountainous area, and many resources have not been utilized. According to incomplete statistics from six counties including Laishui, more than 70 million catties of fruits such as peaches, pears, and apricots rotted in 1956 due to lack of purchasers. Suitable irrigation and drainage machinery and farming machinery for mountainous terrain have not been solved.
    The Zhangjiakou area is a high-dam area in Hebei Province. The mountains there are very high, but there are plains on the mountains. Animal husbandry is developed, and there are also very good conditions for developing industry. However, there are even fewer industries there. The light industry system has only five small factories in the high-dam area, and the heavy industry system does not even have a factory in the Zhangjiakou area. The development of animal husbandry in that area is therefore restricted. Dairy cows are not squeezed for milk, and the milk of dairy cows is not fully squeezed.
    There are more industries in the plain areas. The light industry system has two hundred and twelve enterprises, but most of them are concentrated in cities and along railways, and few penetrate into the countryside.
    The Cangxian and Tianjin special districts of Hebei are near the sea, and there are also large areas of low-lying land. These water areas are also rich in resources. The development of salt industry in the coastal area has great prospects. There is a kind of salt grass that can be used to make wine. The seafood is abundant. Not to mention fresh fish, rotten fish can also be used to make fish fertilizer, fish meal, and fish oil. The low-lying areas, such as Baiyangdian, have many water caltrops, which contain up to 52% starch and can be harvested 40 million catties every year, which has a wide range of uses in industry. However, the industry in the water area is even more of a blank spot, and a large amount of resources are not utilized.
    Now, Hebei Province's local industry proposes the slogan of going up the mountains, up the dams, down to the villages, and down to the water, to change the situation of local industry being separated from agriculture, to promote the leap forward of agriculture, and to seek the leap forward of local industry itself.
              Transformation
    Comrades from the industrial department said that for a long time in the past, they were not firm in implementing the policy of serving the rural economy. As a result, such a situation was created: on the one hand, the rural economy could not be activated, and on the other hand, the development of local industry was also restricted. The machinery industry is an example. The agricultural machinery, fishing tools, and even iron pots and stoves for daily life needed by farmers were in short supply, but the machinery industry could not get enough work, and some even closed down. The coal industry is also an example. The market was out of stock, especially in the mountainous areas, and a large amount of firewood was burned, which was very unfavorable for raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer; however, small coal kilns were once closed down in large numbers, and later they were not restored with the most active attitude. To this day, the number of small coal kilns is only one-third of the original number. Most of the coal needed in the province is transferred from other provinces. The same is true for light industry. A large number of wild plants that can be used for oil extraction are ignored, but the utilization rate of oil extraction equipment is only 75%, and some oil factories are even in a semi-suspended state. There is a shortage of wine in the market, and a large number of fruits that can be used to make wine have rotted, but some of the thirty-seven wineries have been closed all year round, and some have been working half the time and stopping half the time.
    In the past year or two, under the difficult conditions of insufficient raw materials, Hebei Province's local industry has begun to think of ways in the countryside. They found that persimmons can be used to make vinegar, small fish can be used to make soy sauce, locust bean pods can be used to make maltose, and rice straw and mulberry bark can be used to make paper. There are many ways. Some oil factories were originally going to stop work, but they found agricultural cooperatives to process self-reserved oilseeds for farmers, which maintained production. A printing factory had very little business, but it got in touch with agricultural cooperatives, printing account books, forms, and work point vouchers, which solved the problem of insufficient tasks. These have given local industrial cadres great inspiration. Recently, the nationwide movement of going up the mountains and down to the countryside and the Great Leap Forward in various aspects have given them a profound education more directly. What particularly stimulated them was that, at some point, the forces of other provinces had already extended to Hebei Province. Liaoning Province built a cotton stalk fiber factory in Hebei, Jilin Province purchased one million catties of wild grapes at one time, and Tianjin is also studying the utilization of flax skins in Zhangjiakou. Other provinces are so interested in the resources of Hebei Province, how can they stand by and watch?
    Part-time Production, Mother-Child Factories, and Outpost Factories
    Going up the mountains, up the dams, down to the villages, and down to the water, developing local industry in every corner, serving the rural economy on the spot, requires local industry to have greater flexibility and a stronger local color, and it is impossible to universally engage in industry in such a vast area without mobilizing the strength of the masses. Comrades from the Industry Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the two industrial departments believe that a very important issue at present is to change the management system of local industry and give play to the enthusiasm of the county level in operating industry. Although many of Hebei Province's local industries are located in the county, they are all under the leadership of the provincial and special district levels. The county cannot manage them and cannot use its strength. Therefore, it is now considering delegating local industry to the county. Developing county-run industry, allowing the county to organize the strength of the local masses according to local needs, can make local industry better serve the rural economy in accordance with local conditions.
    To meet the needs of the two ups and two downs, the business content and form of local industry must be more flexible. Based on existing experience, the Second Industry Department has studied several forms that are very new and worth introducing:
    First, comprehensive part-time production to solve the contradiction between the long-term nature of factory production and the seasonal nature of certain agricultural resources, and to give full play to equipment efficiency. The sauce and pickle factory in Cixian produces sauces, vinegars, sugars, pastries, and pickles, which are diverse and popular among the masses. The Sangyuan Egg Factory switches to making winter vegetables in winter and has also signed contracts with agricultural cooperatives to integrate the factory's material plan with the agricultural cooperative's production plan.
    Second, mother-child factories. Factories should be located in the place where raw materials are produced for on-site processing, but some factories are suitable for collective production, while resources are not conducive to long-distance transportation. In this case, "mother-child factories" are established. That is, simple small factories are set up in the raw material production area for rough processing or semi-finished product processing, and then transported to large factories for fine processing. For example, paper mills can decentralize pulping and concentrate paper making, milk powder industry can engage in crude milk powder production in animal husbandry areas, and the brewing industry can engage in fermentation stations.
    Third, outpost factories. Like peddlers, a rubber-wheeled cart carries small rice mills, grinders, oil presses, weeding machines, and water lifting machines to provide farmers with a wide range of service processing.
    Comrades from the Second Industry Department also believe that, regardless of the form, to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, it is necessary to rely on and organize the strength of the peasants. They focused on introducing to reporters the experience of the Quyang County Winery. This factory sent one cadre and six workers, with more than seventy yuan, to the mountains to set up an outpost factory to brew jujube wine. In four months, they earned back 24,000 yuan. The reason is that they relied on the peasants. The agricultural cooperative provided wine-making tools such as jars and bottles, and the agricultural cooperative also provided manpower for crushing dates, which not only increased the income of the agricultural cooperative but also reduced the expenses of the enterprise. Everyone was happy. Under the leadership of the Quyang Winery, eight wineries have gone to the mountains.

    在高潮中南行
                    本报记者　范荣康
    我们的社会主义建设事业正以千军万马之势勇往直前，革命的干劲充溢全国，到处都是一片跃进之声。
    朋友们！请你们从报纸上同记者一起作一次旅行吧。记者准备有重点地访问一些省、市，借一支秃笔，力求较多地反映一些工业生产、工业建设和交通运输方面的面貌，以及人们在这些工作中所思考的一些问题。
    一、上山　上坝　下乡　下水
          沉重的压力
    1月13日下午，记者到达保定。这里大雪飘飘，还是今年第一次见雪。瑞雪兆丰年，一片喜气。第二天清早，大街小巷扫雪忙，一辆辆大车进城装雪往乡下送。地里正需要水分滋养呢。全省农业建设积极分子代表会议正在这里召开，1962年生产粮食三百亿斤，变缺粮的河北为有余粮的河北，并生产棉花十亿二千万斤，成为鼓舞全省农民的动员口号。河北省第一工业厅（重工业厅）尹副厅长告诉记者，他参加了几天会议，深为农业大跃进的精神所感动。
    “你知道目前河北农村是个什么状况吗？”尹副厅长说，“光投入水利运动的群众就有六、七百万人。加上积肥的，总数达一千多万人。这样一个农业大跃进的高潮，压得我们厅里狼狈不堪，正常工作的秩序全给打乱了。”
    说“狼狈不堪”，也许夸张了一些，但由于农业大跃进，给地方工业、特别是地方机械工业带来的压力确实是很沉重的。省里统计了一下，各地共需要排灌机械二十七、八万马力，水车三十三万部，而现在生产方面安排下去的，只有八万五千多马力排灌机械和二十万部水车。而且即便如此，原料问题也还没有全部解决；排灌机械有很大一部分是煤气机，还正在试制中。更成问题的是将来的修配。光排灌动力机械，全省现有五千台，加上今年计划下乡的共有两万台，遍布全省各地，没有一个全省范围的、能够及时供应各种零件、及时修配的强大的修配网，是不能充分发挥这些机械的效率的。
    这就难怪第一工业厅感到压力很大了。
              两上两下
    然而，农业大跃进向地方工业部门提出的，岂只是排灌机械而已。农业大跃进，要求地方工业部门全面考虑怎样为农村经济服务，怎样同农村密切结合，农民现在充满了活力。平原要建设，山区要建设，洼地也要建设。生产资料生活资料都要，各种各样的资源都想利用。这些，都等待着地方工业配合。根据这个形势，河北地方工业已经响亮地提出了“两上两下”的口号。这就是：上山、上坝，下乡、下水。
    河北山区面积占全省面积45.9％。山上的资源，据初步调查，仅可以制酒、榨油的东西即达二十多种。苍耳籽、橡籽、椿树籽和山葡萄、山梨等水果到处都是。煤、铁、金、石棉等金属和非金属矿产都有。但目前山区的工业极其薄弱。第二工业厅（轻工业厅）系统，在山区的企业只有四十六个，许多资源都没有利用起来。仅据涞水等六个县不完全的统计，1956年由于无人收购就烂掉桃、梨、杏等水果七千多万斤。适合山区地形的排灌机械和耕作机械，也没有人设法解决。
    张家口一带是河北省的高坝地区，那里山很高，但上了山却是平原，牧畜业发达，也有发展工业的很好的条件。可是，那里工业更少。轻工业系统只有五个小厂在高坝地区，重工业系统在张家口地区连一个厂也没有。那一带牧畜业的发展因此受到限制。耕乳两用牛固然不注意去挤奶，乳牛的奶也没有都挤出来。
    平原地区的工业比较多些，轻工业系统的企业有二百一十二个，但大多集中在城市和铁路沿线，深入乡村的很少。
    河北的沧县专区和天津专区临海，另外还有大片的洼地，这些水区资源也很丰富。临海地区发展盐业的前途很大。有一种盐蒿，可以制酒。海边鱼产丰富，鲜鱼不说，烂鱼也可以制鱼肥、鱼粉、鱼油。洼地，如白洋淀一带有很多水蒺藜，含淀粉量达52％，每年可收四千万斤，在工业上有很广阔的用途。但目前水区的工业更是空白点，大量的资源无人利用。
    现在，河北省地方工业提出上山上坝下乡下水的口号，就是要改变地方工业这种脱离农业的情况，以促进农业的跃进，并从中求得地方工业本身的跃进。
              转　变
    工业厅的同志们说，过去很长时期，他们对贯彻为农村经济服务的方针是不坚决的。结果造成
  了这样一种情况：一方面农村经济不能活跃，一方面地方工业的发展也受到限制。机械工业是一个例子。农民需要的适合当地自然情况的农业机械缺货，捕鱼工具缺货，甚至生活上用的铁锅、火炉也缺货，而机械工业却吃不饱，甚至有些还关了门。煤炭工业也是一个例子。市场脱销，山区尤其紧张，大量的柴草被烧掉了，对养猪、积肥很不利；可是小煤窑却一度大量封闭，后来也没有用最积极的态度去恢复，至今小煤窑的数目仍只及原有数目的三分之一。全省需要的煤炭大都靠外调。轻工业方面也是如此。大批可供榨油的野生植物无人问津，榨油业的设备利用率却只达到75％，有些油厂甚至处在半停工状态。市场上酒脱销，大量可以酿酒的水果烂了，而三十七家酒厂有的终年关着门，有的开工一半，停工一半。
    近一两年来，在原料不足的困难情况下，河北省地方工业才开始到农村去想办法。发现可以用柿子制醋、小鱼制酱油、槐豆角制饴糖、稻草和桑皮制纸，门路很多。有些油厂本来是要停工的，找到农业社去给农民加工自留油料，却把生产维持下来。有一个印刷厂业务很清淡，同农业社挂上钩，印账簿、印表格、印记工票，却解决了任务不足的困难。这些，都给了地方工业干部很大的启发。最近全国范围内的上山下乡运动和各方面的大跃进，更直接给了他们以深刻的教育。特别使他们感到刺激的是，不知从什么时候起，外省的势力已经伸到河北省来。辽宁省在河北建起了一座棉杆纤维厂，吉林省一次购去一百万斤山葡萄，天津市也正研究利用张家口专区的胡麻皮。外省都对河北省的资源这样感到兴趣，自己怎么能袖手旁观？
    兼业生产、子母厂和派出厂
    上山上坝下乡下水，把地方工业发展到每个角落去，就地为农村经济服务，要求地方工业具有更大的灵活性和更浓的地方色彩，而在如此广阔的地区普遍地搞工业，更非发动群众的力量不可。中共河北省委工业部和两个工业厅的同志，都认为当前一个很重要的问题是改变地方工业的管理体制，发挥县一级经营工业的积极性，河北省的地方工业虽然很多都设在县里，但都属省和专区一级领导，县里管不着，有劲使不上。因此，现在正考虑把地方工业下放到县的问题。发展县营工业，由县里根据当地的需要，组织当地群众的力量，可以使地方工业更好地因地制宜地为农村经济服务。
    适应两上两下的需要，地方工业的经营内容和形式也要更灵活些。第二工业厅根据已有的经验，研究了几种形式，很新鲜，值得介绍一下：
    一是综合性的兼业生产，解决工厂生产长期性和某些农业资源季节性的矛盾，充分发挥设备效力。磁县的酱菜厂生产着酱、醋、糖、糕点、酱菜等产品，五花八门，深受群众欢迎。桑园蛋厂一到冬季就改制冬菜，还同农业社订了合同，使工厂用料计划同农业社生产计划相结合。
    二是子母厂，工厂要设在产原料的地方，就地加工，但有些工厂适宜于集体生产，而资源又不利于长途运输，这种情况下搞“子母厂”。即在原料产地设置简易的小厂进行粗加工或半成品加工，再运往大厂精加工。例如造纸厂可以分散制浆集中造纸，奶粉业可以在牧畜地区搞粗制奶粉，酿酒业可以搞发酵站。
    三是派出厂。像货郎担一样，一辆胶轮大车带上小型碾米机、粉碎机、榨油机、锄草机和扬水机等，为农民进行多方面的服务性加工。
    第二工业厅的同志还认为，不论那种形式，要做到多快好省，必须依靠和组织农民的力量。他们着重向记者介绍了曲阳县酒厂的经验。这个厂派出一个干部六个工人，带了七十多块钱上山搞了个派出厂，烧制枣酒，四个月时间就赚回来二万四千元。原因是依靠了农民。缸、瓶等制酒工具是农业社供给的，碾枣也是农业社出人力，既增加了农业社的收入，也减少了企业的开支，真是皆大欢喜。在曲阳酒厂的带动下，酿酒业已有八个工厂上了山。
                  （本篇完，全文待续）
