Xinhua News Agency, January 27th dispatch from Taipei: The American "20th Century Fox Film Company" is preparing to shoot a film that insults China, titled "The Inn of the Sixth Happiness." Many scenes will be filmed in Taiwan. The film's producers and production staff have arrived in Taiwan and Hong Kong to begin work.

Taiwan newspapers reported that the script of "The Inn of the Sixth Happiness" maliciously distorts the facts, depicting the so-called poverty, backwardness, stupidity, and barbarism of the Chinese people. On the other hand, it reverses black and white to praise the "compassion and kindness" of British and American missionaries who came to China to "preach" before liberation. According to the film's depiction, these foreign missionaries were simply the "benefactors" of the Chinese people. In this absurd screenplay, it is fabricated that Chinese women in 1932 still universally bound their feet, and the Kuomintang county magistrate at the time wore the red-topped and feathered uniform of a Qing dynasty official.

After the content of this insulting film was revealed, it aroused criticism from some Taiwan newspapers, which considered it outrageous. However, the Chiang Kai-shek clique actually expressed a "warm welcome" to the film to shoot many scenes and exteriors in Taiwan. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Central Motion Picture Corporation" is prepared to provide technical personnel, locations, and equipment unconditionally. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's Government Information Office is also "doing everything possible to help them." In addition, the American film producers have also requested the Chiang Kai-shek clique to grant Americans who come to Taiwan to film "The Inn of the Sixth Happiness" many special rights, such as providing protection, assistance, and "diplomatic immunity."

The American film producers requested to find sixty women with bound feet in Taiwan in order to film scenes for this insulting film. Taiwan's Kuomintang officials are secretly searching everywhere on their behalf.

    厚颜无耻的奴才相
    美制片商到台湾拍摄侮辱中国的影片
    蒋介石集团竟然表示欢迎并多方协助
    新华社27日讯　台北消息：美国“二十世纪福克斯影片公司”最近准备拍摄一部侮辱中国的影片，片名“六福客店”。其中许多场面都将在台湾拍摄。这部影片的制片人和制片职员们，已经到达台湾和香港活动。
    台湾报纸报道，“六福客店”剧本的内容恶毒地歪曲事实，描绘所谓中国人的贫困、落后、愚蠢和野蛮。另一方面，则颠倒黑白地颂扬在解放前到中国“传教”的英、美传教士的“慈悲和善良”。据影片中描绘，这些外国传教士简直是中国人的“恩主”。在这部荒谬绝伦的电影剧本中，竟捏造说1932年的中国妇女还普遍缠足，当时的国民党县长还穿红顶花翎的清朝官员服装。
    这部侮辱中国的影片的内容传出后，引起了一些台湾报纸的抨击，认为太不像话。但是，蒋介石集团竟然表示“热烈欢迎”这部影片到台湾拍摄许多场面和外景，蒋介石集团的“中央制片厂”准备无条件供给技术人员、场址和器材。蒋介石集团新闻局也“正在竭尽所能地帮助他们”。另外，美国制片商还要求蒋介石集团给予到台湾拍摄“六福客店”一片的美国人许多特殊权利，如给予保护、协助和“外交豁免权”等。
    美国制片商要求在台湾找六十名缠足的小脚妇女，以便拍摄入这部侮辱中国的影片，台湾的国民党官员竟然偷偷地到处代为寻觅。
