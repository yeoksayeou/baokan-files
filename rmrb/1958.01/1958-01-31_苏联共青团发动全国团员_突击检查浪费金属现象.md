Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th. According to the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda," the Central Committee of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League has decided to mobilize Komsomol members nationwide for a surprise inspection of metal utilization in factories, construction sites, and machine tractor stations across the country from February 1st to April 1st. This two-month period aims to assist local Party and economic organizations in eliminating the still-existing phenomenon of metal waste.

The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Youth League suggests that local Komsomol grassroots organizations employ organizational forms such as surprise inspection teams, inspection squads, and Komsomol supervisory posts to conduct inspections. The content of these inspections should include: the standards for metal utilization in national industrial enterprises, construction sites, and machine tractor stations; the utilization of metal scraps and the preservation of metal; as well as the shortcomings in metal usage and the reasons for these shortcomings.

The Soviet Komsomol organizations began organizing surprise inspection teams last year to carry out the conservation movement. Since the launch of this movement, young people have saved the country over 3 billion rubles. However, in the large-scale construction work currently underway across the Soviet Union, there is still a phenomenon of metal waste, with a lot of pig iron, steel, and steel products being wasted. It is estimated that if these wasted metals were utilized, it could save the country billions of rubles. Currently, the youth conservation movement initiated by the Communist Youth League is widely unfolding throughout the Soviet Union.

    苏联共青团发动全国团员
    突击检查浪费金属现象
    新华社莫斯科29日电　据苏联“共青团真理报”报道，苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会决定在2月1日到4月1日的两个月期间，发动全国共青团员对全国工厂、建筑工地和机器拖拉机站利用金属的情况进行一次突击检查，以便帮助各地党组织和经济组织消灭目前仍然存在的浪费金属的现象。
    苏联共青团中央建议共青团各地基层组织运用下列的组织形式，如突击检查组、检查队和共青团监督岗，来进行检查，检查的内容是：全国工业企业、工地和机器拖拉机站利用金属的标准、利用金属碎屑和保存金属的情况、以及在使用金属方面存在的缺点和发生缺点的原因。
    苏联共青团组织从去年就开始组织突击检查队以开展节约运动。这个运动开展以来，青年们已经为国家节省了三十多亿卢布。但是在目前苏联全国进行的大规模建设工作中还存在着浪费金属的现象，有许多生铁、钢和钢材被浪费掉。据估计，如果把这些浪费的金属都利用起来，就可以为国家节省成十亿的卢布。现在，共青团发起的青年节约运动正在苏联全国各地广泛展开。
