    This is Not the Way to Care for Downward Transferred Cadres
    To the Editor:
    In order to build a new socialist countryside and to train and reform cadres, many office cadres and young intellectuals and full-time cadres from industrial and mining enterprises have gone to the countryside in batches. This is originally a good thing, and conscious cadres and intellectuals have also realized this. They are all full of enthusiasm and high aspirations to meet this new task.
    However, it has been discovered in some factories and enterprises that they do not encourage the comrades who go to the mountains and countryside more from a political and ideological point of view, but rather satisfy them from an economic point of view. For example, inviting these many comrades who go to the mountains and countryside to a tavern for a big meal, and buying a lot of items for them to use. This is not only not good for the cadres, but also has a bad influence on the peasants. For example, the Shanghai New Textile Factory, a joint state-private enterprise in Wuxi City, recently had a group of people sent to the nearby suburbs—Qingchu Township. In order to take care of them, the leadership transported all the bedding, dining tables, buckets, and other utensils used for accommodation in the factory to the township by trucks. The factory even sent several mud masons to the commune to build kitchens for them. When they were sent off to the countryside, they rented beautiful Czech-style buses, and all the large and small cars (three in total) in the factory were dispatched, going back and forth on this suburban lakeside road. For stage lighting, a small generator was brought to the commune at night. The comrades who remained in the factory pooled together and gave each comrade who went to the countryside a bamboo-shell thermos. The peasants were very dissatisfied with this kind of showiness and extravagance. Some said, "It's better than the bride and groom at a wedding." Some peasants said, "We have stoves and pots at home, why don't we eat and live with us?"
    We hope that this kind of phenomenon will not happen again when cadres are sent down.

### 这不是爱护下放干部的办法

    这不是爱护下放干部的办法编辑同志：
    为了建设社会主义新农村和锻炼改造干部，许多机关干部、工矿企业中的科室青年知识分子、脱产干部，都一批批地下乡了。这本是一件美好的事，有觉悟的干部和知识分子们也都认识到这一点，他们一个个无不热情饱满和志气高昂地来迎接这项新的任务。
    但是，目前在某些工厂企业中，发现了这样一种情况：他们对上山下乡的同志不是更多地从政治上、思想上鼓励他们，而是从经济上来满足他们。如：请这许多上山下乡的同志到酒馆大吃一顿，买很多物品送给他们应用。这样不但对干部没有好处，而且会在农民中产生不良影响。例如，无锡市公私合营申新纺织厂，不久前有一批人下放到近郊区——青初乡，领导上为了照顾他们，把工厂内住宿的床铺、吃饭用的台子、提桶等一切用具，都用卡车运送到乡下去。厂里甚至派了几个泥水匠到社里去给他们造灶间。在欢送下乡时，租借了美丽的捷克式的公共汽车，厂内的大小汽车（三辆）一齐出动，在这郊区湖滨路上来来往往。为了演戏照明，晚上还带了小型的发电机到社去。留厂的同志凑合起来给下乡的同志每人送了一只竹壳热水瓶。农民对这种讲求排场，铺张浪费的情况，很不满意，有的说：“赛过结婚时的新郎新娘了。”有的农民说：“我们家里有灶头、锅子，为啥不与我们同吃、同宿呢？”
    我们希望在干部下放时，不要再发生这种现象。　　　　陆依
