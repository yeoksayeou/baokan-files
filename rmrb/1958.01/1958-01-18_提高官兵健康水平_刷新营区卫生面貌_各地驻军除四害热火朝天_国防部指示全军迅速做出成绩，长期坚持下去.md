Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Troops stationed throughout the country are throwing themselves into the enthusiastic campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene with a fighting spirit.

Leading organs of various military branches and arms and major units stationed in Beijing held a series of meetings before and after the New Year to deploy the campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. Subsequently, the vast numbers of officers and soldiers of various organs, troops, and academies immediately launched an offensive against the four pests with a fighting posture. Various units of a certain department universally held mobilization meetings on the 2nd, suspending all drills and devoting all efforts to the battle of eliminating the four pests. The officers and soldiers not only thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed all the furniture and corners inside, truly achieving "six-sided brightness," but also cleaned up the withered grass, garbage, and drainage ditches around the barracks. They also thoroughly searched for places where the four pests were likely to hide. During the day, reconnaissance teams were sent to scout the tracks of sparrows, and at night they carried flashlights and cloth bags to catch sparrows under the eaves or in the ventilation holes of houses. All officers and soldiers of the Training Department, under the action slogan of "Everyone Eliminates the Four Pests, Every Family Mobilizes for Hygiene," have forced the four pests to have nowhere to hide, and even mosquitoes hiding under the stairs and in the heating pipes have been searched for and exterminated.

Many troops stationed in the Shenyang area have formulated specific plans for eliminating the four pests and are using all spare time to eliminate them. A company of a certain unit captured 387 rats in the rice fields in just one Saturday afternoon and Sunday. Officers and soldiers of a certain battalion stationed in Harbin have been persisting in eliminating the four pests for the past three years, having exterminated more than 151,000 rats, more than 12,000 sparrows, more than 256,000 flies, and more than 36 catties of fly pupae. Currently, under the slogan of "Maintaining Honor and Continuing to Create New Achievements," the officers and soldiers of this battalion are launching a new high tide of eliminating the four pests.

A large-scale extermination campaign against the seven pests (rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, flies, bedbugs, cockroaches, and snails) by the Shanghai Garrison has been fully launched. More than 270 engineering soldiers stationed in Shanghai were dispatched to support local residents in the Xujiahui and Huaihai Middle Road areas to dig up pupae, fill ditches, wash and sweep large and small latrines, wash more than 340 garbage bins, and fill a stinking pond, ten meters long and three meters deep, where mosquitoes and flies breed.

On the afternoon of the 4th, the leaders of the troops stationed in the Jinan area personally led more than 2,000 officers and soldiers to participate in the city-wide clean-up in Jinan. The officers and soldiers not only swept the streets and alleys clean but also swept the courtyards of residents on both sides. Under the influence of the troops, many residents also voluntarily participated in the cleaning work. At the same time, the troops also organized propaganda vehicles and propaganda stations to promote methods and experiences for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene to the citizens.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Ministry of National Defense instructed the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the 16th to immediately launch a mass patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests throughout the army, and to quickly achieve results, persist in the long term, improve the health level of all officers and soldiers, and make the sanitary appearance of all barracks brand new.

The Ministry of National Defense issued this instruction when approving a report from the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on launching a mass patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests throughout the army.

The General Logistics Department put forward specific requirements for carrying out this movement in the report, requiring the entire army to play an exemplary role in the massive national patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests, to eliminate the four pests in the barracks, "everyone speaks hygiene, everywhere is clean"; At the same time, according to the possibility, a certain amount of time and manpower should be extracted to actively participate in the local patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests, and significant achievements must be made.

The General Logistics Department required in the report that all kitchens, canteens, food warehouses, toilets, livestock pens, and all places prone to breeding flies should be kept clean at all times; all offices and dormitories should be cleaned regularly, and garbage in the驻地 should be cleared in a timely manner to keep the barracks free of mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows; water sources should be improved, attention should be paid to the cleanliness of drinking water, and soldiers should be educated to strictly pay attention to personal hygiene, to have their hair cut, bathe, and cut their nails on time, change clothes and sun bedding frequently, not to eat unclean raw and cold snacks, and to wash their hands before and after meals as much as possible, and to boil and disinfect bowls, chopsticks, and tableware. The health personnel of the troops should go deep into the companies, do a good job in health propaganda and education, and personally participate in guiding the improvement of the health facilities of the troops.

The report hopes that through this movement, thousands of "four-free companies," "four-free organs," "four-free schools," "four-free hospitals," "four-free warehouses," and "four-free barracks" can emerge, effectively further improving the health level of all officers and soldiers, so as to ensure the smooth completion of various tasks of the troops.

    提高官兵健康水平　刷新营区卫生面貌
    各地驻军除四害热火朝天
    国防部指示全军迅速做出成绩，长期坚持下去
    据新华社17日讯　全国各地驻军以战斗姿态投入热火朝天的除四害、讲卫生运动。
    驻北京各军种、兵种和各大单位领导机关，在新年前后专门召开了一系列的会议，部署除四害、讲卫生运动。接着，各机关、部队、院校广大官兵立即以战斗姿态奋力向四害发起进攻。某部各单位在2日普遍召开了动员大会，并停止一切操课，全力投入除四害的战斗。官兵们不仅把室内一切家具、各个角落都彻底作了揩洗、清扫，真正作到了“六面光”，营房周围的枯草、垃圾、排水沟也进行了清理。他们还彻底搜索了四害容易躲藏的地方，白天派出侦察组侦察麻雀出没的踪迹，夜晚就带着手电筒和布袋，到麻雀藏身的屋檐下或房屋的通气孔等处捕捉。训练总监部全体官兵在“人人动手除四害、家家动员讲卫生”的行动口号下，已逼得四害无地藏身，连钻在楼梯底下和暖气道里的蚊子也被搜捕扑灭了。
    驻沈阳地区的很多部队都订出了除四害的具体计划，并利用一切课余时间清除四害。某部一连仅在一个星期六的下午和星期日就在稻田里捕到三百八十七只老鼠。驻哈尔滨的某营官兵三年来一直坚持除四害，共已扑灭老鼠十五万一千多只、麻雀一万二千多只、苍蝇二十五万六千多个和蝇蛹三十六斤多。目前，这个营的官兵在“保持荣誉、继续创造新成就”的口号下，正在掀起除四害的新高潮。
    上海驻军大规模的除七害（鼠、雀、蚊、蝇、臭虫、蟑螂、钉螺）歼灭战已经全面展开。驻上海的工程兵部队出动二百七十多人，分别在徐家汇、淮海中路一带支援当地居民挖蛹、填沟、洗扫大小便池，并洗刷了三百四十多个垃圾箱，填平了十公尺长、三公尺深的一个孳生蚊、蝇的臭水塘。
    驻济南地区部队的首长，4日下午亲自率领两千多名官兵，参加了济南全市的清洁大扫除。官兵们不仅扫净了大街小巷，还把两旁居民的院子扫得干干净净。在部队的影响下，很多居民也自动参加了清扫工作。与此同时，部队还组织宣传车、宣传站，向市民宣传除四害、讲卫生的办法和经验。
    据新华社17日讯　国防部16日指示中国人民解放军立即在全军范围内开展一个群众性的以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，并且要迅速做出成绩，长期坚持下去，把全军官兵的健康水平提高一步，使所有营区的卫生面貌焕然一新。
    国防部是在批转中国人民解放军总后勤部的一份关于在全军范围内开展一个群众性的以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动的报告时作出这个指示的。
    总后勤部在报告中对开展这个运动提出了具体的要求，要求全军在全国规模巨大的、以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动中起模范作用，做到在营区内除净四害，“人人讲卫生，处处都清洁”；同时要根据可能，抽出一定时间和人力，积极参加地方上的以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，并且一定要做出显著成绩来。
    总后勤部在报告中要求全军的厨房、食堂、食品仓库、厕所、畜圈等一切容易孳生苍蝇的地方，应当经常保持清洁；所有办公室、宿舍要经常打扫，驻地的垃圾要及时清除，保持营区内无蚊蝇、无鼠雀；要改善水源，注意饮水的清洁，并教育战士严格讲究个人卫生，做到按时理发、洗澡、剪指甲，经常换衣服、晒被褥，不吃不清洁的生冷零食，尽可能做到饭前饭后洗手，碗筷食具要煮沸消毒。部队的卫生人员要深入连队，做好卫生宣传教育工作，亲自参加指导改进部队的卫生设施。
    报告希望全军经过这次运动，能够出现千百个“四无连队”、“四无机关”、“四无学校”、“四无医院”、“四无仓库”、“四无营房”，有效地进一步提高全体官兵的健康水平，以保障部队各项任务的顺利完成。（附图片）
