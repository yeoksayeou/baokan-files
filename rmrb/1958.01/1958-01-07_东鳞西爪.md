Eastern Scales and Western Claws

    New Construction on Dachen Island
    After building a reservoir capable of supplying water to tens of thousands of people, the people of Dachen Island have begun to build a club and a power plant.
    The club was built with money and labor contributed by the island's fishermen, farmers, and soldiers, symbolizing the friendship and unity between the military and the people, and is named "Dachen Island Friendship Club."
    The club covers 500 square meters and includes a hall with 800 seats, a wired broadcasting station, a reading room, and a recreational activity room.
    The site for the power plant has been selected, and construction will begin soon. (Lin Rijian)

    Construction of Twenty-Five Hydroelectric Power Stations
    Guangdong Province is about to start constructing twenty-five hydroelectric power stations with a total generating capacity of 2,461 kilowatts. After these hydroelectric power stations are completed, they can supply some agricultural cooperatives with electricity for pumping irrigation, processing, and lighting.
    Most of the construction funds for these hydroelectric power stations are invested by local governments and raised by farmers themselves; some of the larger hydroelectric power stations are invested in by overseas Chinese. (Hong Wucai)

    New Ways to Increase Sugar Production
    In Wuwei and Yinchuan, Gansu, and other places, the trial production of beet sugar using indigenous methods has been successful.
    The sugar produced in Wuwei and other places has no radish or lime taste, and the granules are large and of pure quality. The quality of the sugar is the same as that of second-grade white sugar in Northeast China, with a sugar content of 94% to 95%; the brown sugar is comparable to red sugar in Guangdong. This opens up avenues for greatly increasing sugar production in the next year or two. (Zhang Yuting)

    Carrot Wine
    The jointly state-private owned Dongtai Winery in Jiangsu Province successfully produced wine from carrots at the end of November 1957.
    Carrots are a major local specialty in Jiangsu and other provinces, with a yield of about 2,000 catties per mu. The factory's trial production showed that 100 catties of carrots can produce 50 catties of sweet wine. The carrot wine is yellow in color and sweet in taste, and the price is 25% lower than the rice sweet wine sold on the market. The carrot residue after winemaking can continue to be used to feed pigs. (Zhang Yi, Sun Chunhua)

    东鳞西爪
    大陈岛的新建设
    大陈岛的人们，在建成了一座可供数万人吃用的水库以后，又开始兴建一座俱乐部、一个电厂。
    俱乐部是全岛渔民、农民和军队自己出钱出力兴建的，象征着军民的友谊和团结，命名为“大陈岛友谊俱乐部”。
    俱乐部共五百平方公尺，包括一个能容八百个座位的大厅，一个有线广播站，一个书报阅览室和一个文娱活动室。
    发电厂的厂址已选定，不久就要动工兴建。　（林日见）
    兴建二十五个水电站
    广东省即将动手兴建二十五个水力发电站，总发电能力达二千四百六十一瓩。这些水电站建成后，可供一部分农业社抽水灌溉、加工和照明用电。
    这些水电站的建设经费，大部分是由地方投资和农民自筹的；一些较大的水电站，是由华侨投资的。（洪乌才）
    增产砂糖的新途径
    甘肃武威、银川等地用土法试制甜菜砂糖成功。
    武威等地制出的砂糖完全没有萝卜味或石灰味，而且颗粒大、质量也很纯洁。砂糖和东北二级白砂糖的质量一样，含糖率达94％到95％；红糖与广东赤砂糖不相上下。这就为一两年内大量增产食糖开辟了道路。　（张玉亭）
    葫萝卜制酒
    江苏省公私合营东台酒厂于1957年11月底，利用葫萝卜制酒成功。
    葫萝卜是江苏等省的大宗土特产，每亩产量二千斤左右，这个厂试制的结果，每百斤葫萝卜可产甜酒五十斤。葫萝卜酒色黄味甜，价格比市销的米甜酒降低25％，制过酒后的葫萝卜渣子继续可以喂猪。
