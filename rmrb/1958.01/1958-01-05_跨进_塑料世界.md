    As the Second Five-Year Plan begins, the first Shanghai residents to have the opportunity to visit the Shanghai Plastics Exhibition, which opened yesterday, have bought the first batch of domestically produced plastic raincoats, tablecloths, handbags, and many other plastic products. Transparent, soft, and foldable raincoats sell for only twelve or thirteen yuan, and beautiful, colorful, and washable printed tablecloths sell for just over two yuan. These durable and inexpensive daily necessities, which are not made of cotton or silk, were previously imported luxury items that only a very few people in the Shanghai market could afford. Now, the exhibition staff tells people: China can manufacture them itself. This is just the beginning. We will manufacture everything made of plastic, and the price can be cheaper day by day. Before long, the money to buy an ordinary raincoat will buy five or six plastic raincoats.

    Walking into the plastic exhibition held in the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building, one gets the feeling of entering a new "glass world." Everything here is not the real glass commonly seen in windows, but new man-made items—chemical plastics—that replace cotton yarn, silk, wool, leather, rubber, paint, glass, ceramics, wood, and various metals. Here, you can see nearly four thousand products manufactured by Shanghai's plastics industry—interesting children's toys, leather shoes and leather coats that are several times stronger than cowhide, beautiful and lightweight household appliances, glass used in airplanes, silent gears used in machines, and colorful pipes of varying thicknesses that replace metal and rubber.

    After a tour of the exhibition, a strong impression is that China's emerging plastics industry is rapidly catching up with advanced industrial countries. In advanced industrial countries, plastics have been increasingly used in daily necessities and industrial equipment in recent years, but the tens of thousands of plastic products are still made of only twenty or thirty kinds of plastics such as polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, epoxy resin, polyester, nylon, and cellulose acetate. The exhibition tells people that Shanghai could only produce two kinds before the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan; by the end of the First Five-Year Plan, it had developed to eight kinds, and sixteen kinds of plastics, such as polytetrafluoroethylene and polyethylene, have also been successfully trial-produced in the laboratory, and the manufacturing technology has been initially mastered.

    The exhibition focuses on introducing the performance and function of several newly made plastics and plastic products in Shanghai. An ion exchange resin that can turn seawater into fresh water and extract rare metals from industrial wastewater is particularly noteworthy. This resin was jointly developed by East China Institute of Chemical Technology and other units. This plastic is especially suitable for softening boiler water and extracting antibiotics. Recently, some factories in Shanghai that manufacture radio equipment and radios have begun to try using a plastic known as "universal glue" to glue metal and wood. Steel plates glued with this glue will not be pulled apart even if the steel plate is broken. It was trial-produced by the technical personnel of the China Bakelite Factory last year. The factory plans to start mass production of this glue next year for various places in need. Bakelite powder is an old product that Shanghai has had in the past. Now, various laminates are pressed from the raw material for making bakelite powder—phenolic resin—and made into silent, wear-resistant gears that do not conduct electricity and do not require oiling, and even bearings used in rolling mills.

    In a specially opened exhibition hall, two flower houses and greenhouses made of transparent plastic film were set up, cultivating summer-growing tomatoes and flowers. The commentator said that the greenhouse made of this plastic film can transmit ultraviolet rays, and it is warmer than a glass greenhouse, making it more suitable for cultivating vegetables and fruits. This plastic film made of polyvinyl chloride is processed and manufactured by the Shanghai Chemical Plant, which is being expanded. In addition to using polyvinyl chloride to manufacture this transparent film, the Shanghai Chemical Plant also produces sheaths for high-grade wires and cables, oil pipes for the petroleum industry, artificial leather, and films for manufacturing plastic raincoats.

    The basic raw materials for manufacturing plastics are coal, calcium carbide, petroleum waste gas, and various plant fibers. The Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant built in Northeast China, the petroleum industry developed in Northwest China, and the coking plants established in various places have prepared good conditions for the development of the plastics industry.

    In the near future, Shanghai will transform from a city that imports plastic products to a city that exports plastic products.

### 跨进“塑料世界”

    跨进“塑料世界”
    新华社记者　季群
    当第二个五年计划开始的时候，最早得到机会参观昨天开幕的上海市塑料展览会的上海人，买到了第一批国产的玻璃雨衣、台布、手提包等许多种塑料制品。透明、轻软又可以折放在口袋里的雨衣，只卖十二、三元，漂亮多彩又不需要洗的印花台布，只卖两元多些。这些不用棉花或蚕丝做成的、既耐用又便宜的日用品，在不久以前还是上海市场上只有极少数人买得起的进口奢侈品，现在，展览会的工作人员告诉人们：中国能够自己制造了。这不过是开始。我们就要制造出一切用塑料制造的东西，而且价钱可以一天比一天更便宜，不会很久，买一件普通雨衣的钱可以买五、六件玻璃雨衣。
    走进设在上海中苏友好大厦的塑料展览会，就给人一种感觉：好像走进了一个新的“玻璃世界”。这里的一切，不是人们在窗子上常见的真正的玻璃，而是代替了棉纱、蚕丝、羊毛、皮革、橡胶、油漆、玻璃、陶瓷、木材和各种金属的新的人造物品——化学塑料。这里可以看到上海塑料工业制造的近四千种产品——有趣的儿童玩具，比牛皮还要牢几倍的皮鞋、皮大衣，美丽轻巧的家用器具，飞机上用的玻璃，机器上用的无声齿轮，以及色彩鲜艳、粗细不等的代替金属和橡胶的管子。
    在展览会上走一趟，一个强烈的印象是：我国新兴的塑料工业，正在快马加鞭地追赶先进的工业国家。在先进的工业国家，近年来已经越来越多地在生活日用品和工业器材方面应用塑料，但是成千成万种塑料制品到目前为止也不过是聚氯乙烯、聚乙烯、环氧树脂、涤纶、尼龙、醋酸纤维等二三十种塑料制成的。展览会告诉人们，在第一个五年计划实施前，上海只能生产两种；到第一个五年计划结束的时候，已经发展到八种，还有十六种塑料，如聚四氟乙烯、聚乙烯等也都在实验室里试制成功，初步掌握了制造技术。
    展览会着重地介绍了上海新近制成的几种塑料和塑料制品的性能和作用。一种能够把海水变为淡水、而且能够从工业废水里提炼出稀有金属的离子交换树脂，特别引人注意。这种树脂是由华东化工学院等几个单位共同研究成功的。这种塑料特别适用于软化锅炉用水和提炼抗生素。最近上海一些制造无线电器材和收音机的工厂，在开始试用一种号称“万能胶”的塑料来胶合金属和木材。用这种胶胶合的钢板，即使把钢板拉断，也不会拉开胶合的部位。它是中国胶木厂的技术人员去年试制成功的，这个厂准备明年开始大量生产这种胶水，供各地需要。电木粉是上海过去就有的老产品，现在，用制造电木粉的原料——酚醛树脂压制成了各种层压板，做成了不会导电、不需加油的无声耐磨齿轮，甚至做成了轧钢机上用的轴承。
    在一间专门辟出的陈列厅里，架起了两间用透明的塑料薄膜做成的花房和暖棚，培育着夏季生长的蕃茄和鲜花。讲解员说，用这种塑料薄膜做的暖棚能够透过紫外线，它比玻璃暖棚暖和，更适宜于培育蔬菜水果。这种用聚氯乙烯做成的塑料薄膜，是由正在扩建的上海化工厂加工制造的。上海化工厂除了用聚氯乙烯制造这种透明的薄膜以外，还出产高级电线、电缆用的套管，石油工业用的油管，人造皮革和制造玻璃雨衣用的薄膜。
    制造塑料的基本原料，是煤、电石、石油废气和各种植物纤维等等。我国在东北建成的吉林电石厂、在西北发展的石油工业以及在各地建立的炼焦厂，都为发展塑料工业准备了良好的条件。
    在不久的将来，上海将要从进口塑料制品的城市变为出口塑料制品的城市。
