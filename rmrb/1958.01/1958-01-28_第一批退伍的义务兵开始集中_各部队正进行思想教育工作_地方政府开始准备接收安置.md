Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are actively carrying out organizational preparations and ideological education for the demobilization of conscripts. Local governments are also simultaneously launching preparations to receive demobilized conscripts.

At the end of last year, the General Staff Department and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army issued a joint directive to the entire army, deciding that the conscripts enlisted in 1954 and assigned to the army should, with the exception of those whose work truly requires it, be allowed to serve beyond their term of service in accordance with Article 10 of the "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China," and the rest should be completely demobilized.

According to this directive, various units have begun to carry out various specific tasks. Units in Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and other places have drawn cadres to form offices. Some units have also held demobilization work meetings, specifically arranging the time, steps, and methods of demobilization work. Before the demobilized conscripts and the re-enlisted volunteer soldiers leave the team, all units are in the process of, or will soon spend two weeks to a month on short-term intensive training, conducting rural construction vision and policy education for them, calling on them to play a key role on the agricultural production front after returning to their hometowns, and actively serve in the reserve and drive rural youth to participate in basic militia teams. At present, some units have determined that the demobilized conscripts have begun to assemble with the farewells of unit leaders and comrades.

The Central Transfer and Construction Committee and the Ministry of Internal Affairs also jointly issued an emergency notice on the 31st of last month, instructing all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government to set up temporary transfer stations or reception stations at appropriate locations along the routes taken by demobilized conscripts. When demobilized conscripts arrive at their original counties and cities, the original counties and cities should organize welcomes and receptions, introduce them to the local situation, and encourage them to settle down in production and work actively. In order to enable demobilized conscripts to quickly engage in production after returning to their hometowns, townships and communes should make production arrangements based on local conditions to help them master and familiarize themselves with production technology. At present, various regions are actively preparing. The Liaoning Provincial Transfer and Construction Committee and the Department of Civil Affairs have decided to set up reception stations in all cities, counties (banners), and also set up transfer stations in ten locations including Shenyang, Jinzhou, Dahu Mountain, and Fengcheng. The Hunan Provincial Transfer and Construction Committee has already drafted a plan for reception and resettlement work. The party and government leading organs in some prefectures have also decided to use newspapers, broadcasts, blackboards, slogans, and other means to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity to the masses.

    第一批退伍的义务兵开始集中
    各部队正进行思想教育工作
    地方政府开始准备接收安置
    据新华社24日讯　中国人民解放军许多部队积极进行义务兵退伍的组织准备和思想教育工作。各地政府也同时展开接收退伍义务兵的准备工作。
    去年年底，人民解放军总参谋部、总政治部向全军发布了联合指示，决定1954年度征集入伍补入陆军部队的义务兵，除了由于工作确实需要，可以根据中华人民共和国兵役法第十条的规定，实行超期服役以外，其余要全部退伍。
    根据这一指示，各部队已开始进行各项具体工作。广州、福州等部队都抽调干部组成了办公室。有些部队还召开了退伍工作会议，具体安排了退伍工作的时间、步骤和方法，在退伍的义务兵和复员的志愿兵离队以前，各部队都正在或即将抽出两周到一个月的时间进行短期集训，向他们进行农村建设远景和政策教育，号召他们回乡后在农业生产战线上起骨干作用，并积极服预备役和带动农村青年参加基干民兵队。目前，有些部队确定退伍的义务兵已经在部队首长和战友们的欢送下开始集中。
    中央转业建设委员会和内务部也在上月31日联合发出紧急通知，指示各省、自治区、直辖市在退伍义务兵沿途经过的适当地点设立临时转运站或接收站。在退伍义务兵到达原籍县、市时，原籍县、市要组织欢迎、接待，向他们介绍当地情况，勉励他们安心生产、积极工作。为使退伍义务兵回乡后很快地投入生产，各地乡、社要根据当地具体情况做好生产上的安排，帮助他们掌握和熟悉生产技术。目前，各地正在积极着手准备，辽宁省转业建设委员会和民政厅决定除各市、县（旗）设立接待站以外，还在沈阳、锦州、大虎山、凤城等十个地点设置转运站。湖南省转业建设委员会已经拟出了接收和安置工作的方案。有些专区的党政领导机关还确定利用报刊、广播、黑板报、标语等，向群众进行广泛深入的宣传。
