    Settling Down in the Jianmen Mountain Area
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the farmers in the Jianmen Mountain area of northwestern Sichuan Province are undergoing tremendous changes, presenting a vibrant and prosperous new landscape. The desolate conditions of the past are gone forever.
    Seeing that the Jianmen Mountain area had vast land, diverse sideline occupations, and good veteran cooperative members, 339 farming households from the foot of the mountain voluntarily moved to settle down in the mountains in 1956. In 1957, over 3,000 households were relocated from the Suining Special District to Jiange County. With the help of the local people's government and the masses, these farmers joined agricultural cooperatives.
    The farmers who moved to the mountains have a high level of enthusiasm for production. This photo shows farmers who came to the Qianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Ximiao Township, Jiange County, weeding in the wheat fields.
    The farmers who moved to the mountains brought the intensive farming techniques of the plains to the mountainous areas. This photo shows Xie Chunshan (right), a member of the Qianfeng Agricultural Cooperative who moved from the plains, introducing the method of selecting cotton seeds to the cooperative's production technology management cadre.

    安家在剑门山区
    四川省西北部的剑门山区农民，在共产党的领导下，面貌日新月异，呈现出一片欣欣向荣的新景象，荒芜的面貌一去不复返了。
    山下的农民看到剑门山区土地广、副业多、老社员好，1956年有三百三十九户农民自动移居上山安家落户。1957年，遂宁专区又往剑阁县移民三千多户。这些农民在当地人民政府和群众的帮助下，分别参加了农业社。
    上山农民，生产热情很高。这是来到剑阁县西庙乡前锋农业社的农民在麦田里锄草。
    上山农民把平坝地区的精耕细作技术带到了山区。这是上山来的前锋农业社社员谢春山（右）正向社里的生产技术管理干部介绍选棉籽的方法。
