New Three Years, Old Three Years, Washing and Mending for Another Three Years
    Shi Lin

    The Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory's Safety Technology Section drafted a plan for 72,000 feet of cloth for labor protection supplies in 1958. The Party Committee found that this plan did not conform to the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, so it handed it over to the workers for discussion. The workers' discussion proved that the Safety Technology Section's request for 72,000 feet of cotton cloth from the state was completely unnecessary. Because 72,000 feet of cloth could make 4,800 sets of work clothes, according to the factory's existing number of employees (including the factory director, Party Committee secretary, and odd-job workers), each person could get an average of two sets. The factory director, Party Committee secretary, cadres above the level of foreman, and odd-job workers do not need work clothes at all. Those who need work clothes do not need two sets at all.

    What is particularly serious is that the workers do not need new work clothes now. According to investigations, because new work clothes are issued every year, now, every worker in the factory has two to three sets of work clothes, and some individuals have accumulated five or six sets. The cutting and loading workshop warehouse also has 202 pairs of anti-injury shoes, 159 pairs of anti-injury trousers, and 196 other labor protection supplies that cannot be distributed. Workshop cadres said: If we continue to issue new labor protection products, we will not even have a place to put them. Too many work clothes have been issued, and some workers and cadres cannot finish wearing them, so they change them into "jackets" or "Hong Kong-style pants"; some people unravel their unneeded yarn gloves and weave them into well-fitting yarn sweaters; some people dye their work clothes, change their style, and give them to their family members to wear. Even some individuals sell them.

    In the discussion, the veteran workers not only severely exposed the factory leaders' bureaucracy and subjectivism, but also criticized the Safety Technology Section as a "spendthrift." They said that the plan formulated by the Safety Technology Section was a wasteful plan, and it did not consider the Party Central Committee's principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily at all. Yang Guangxin, a veteran worker at the coal gas furnace in the smelting workshop, said: "The work clothes issued at the same time, the veteran workers are still wearing them well, but the young workers have already torn them. What is the reason for this?" Zhang Caiwen and Wei He, veteran workers with 25 or 26 years of service in the No. 1 kiln of the smelting workshop, took out physical objects to argue. They both displayed the tattered clothes they had worn for more than ten years in the old society. They said: "Let the young workers see the lives of workers in the old society!" Then, various workshops also displayed the work clothes worn by new and old workers, and the contrast was clear and vivid. It was truly a living teaching material, giving all the workers in the factory a vivid political lesson.

    After the debate and seeing the physical object exhibition, all the workers received a profound education. The 72,000 feet of cotton cloth plan was cancelled. More than 98% of the workers automatically returned their surplus and unnecessary work clothes, anti-injury clothes, anti-injury shoes, and other labor protection supplies. The more than 140 workers in the raw materials workshop returned more than 290 pieces of work clothes. The young workers unanimously expressed that they would learn from the veteran workers' spirit of "new three years, old three years, washing and mending for another three years" of thrifty use of materials, and work together to run socialist enterprises well.

    新三年　旧三年　洗洗补补又三年

    秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂安全技术科制订一个1958年劳动保护用品用布七万二千尺的计划。党委发现这个计划不符合勤俭办企业的原则，于是把它交给职工讨论。经过职工们的讨论证明，安全技术科向国家要七万二千尺棉布，完全是多余的。因为七万二千尺布可做成四千八百套工作服，按照这厂的现有职工（包括厂长、党委书记、勤杂人员）人数计算，平均每人可以得两套。厂长、党委书记、工长以上干部和勤杂人员根本不要工作服。需要工作服的人，根本也不要二套。
    尤其严重的是：现在职工并不需要新工作服。据调查：由于年年发新工作服，现在，全厂工人每人都有两套到三套工作服，个别的人已积下了五、六套。切装车间仓库还有二百零二双防伤鞋、一百五十九条防伤裤以及其它劳动保护用品一百九十六件发不下去。车间干部说：再往下发新劳动保护品，我们连个放的地方都没有了。工作服发得太多，有的工人和干部穿不完，就把它改成“夹克”或“港式裤”；有的人把自己不需要的线手套拆成线织成了合身的线衣穿；有的人把工作服染了色，改了样，给自己的家属穿。更有个别的人把它卖掉。
    在讨论中，老工人不仅狠狠地揭发了工厂领导的官僚主义和主观主义，而且还批评了安全技术科是“败家子”。他们说，安全技术科制订的计划是一个浪费计划，根本没有想到党中央提出的勤俭办企业的方针。熔制车间煤气炉老工人杨广新说：“同时发的工作服，老工人穿的还很好，青年工人都穿破了，这是啥原因？”熔制车间一号窑有二十五、六年工龄的老工人张才文、韦和，拿出实物来辩论。他们俩人展出了自己在旧社会穿过十几年的破烂不堪的衣服。他们说：“让青年工人看看旧社会的工人生活吧！”接着，各车间也纷纷展出了新、老工人穿过的工作服，对比鲜明生动，真是活的教材，给全厂职工上了一堂生动的政治课。
    经过辩论，又看了实物展览，全体职工受到了深刻的教育。七万二千尺棉布计划给取消了。有98％以上的工人自动地交回多余的和不必要的工作服、防伤服、防伤鞋和其它劳动保护用品。原料车间的一百四十多名工人就交回了二百九十多件工作服。青年工人们一致表示要学习老工人的“新三年、旧三年、洗洗补补又三年”的俭节用物的精神，共同努力办好社会主义企业。
