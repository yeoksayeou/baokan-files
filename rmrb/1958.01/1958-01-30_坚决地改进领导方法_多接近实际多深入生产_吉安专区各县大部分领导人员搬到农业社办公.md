Jiangxi Daily News: Party, government, and people's organizations leadership organs in the Ji'an Special District are changing their leadership methods with strong revolutionary will and implementing "institutional decentralization." The Agricultural Work Department and Production Office of the District Committee, led by Zhao Chou, the Second Secretary of the District Committee, and Ning Ziming, the Minister of Agricultural Work, moved to Hebuqiao Township in the suburbs of Ji'an City on January 23 to work together; the Propaganda Department, the Organization Department, and relevant departments of the Special Commissioner's Office have also transferred a group of strong cadres to work in the nine agricultural cooperatives of Hebuqiao Township. These cadres sent to the countryside are responsible for cultivating a test plot. The Agricultural Work Departments and Offices of the county committees of each county have moved to the countryside, and most of the Organization Departments, Propaganda Departments, the Communist Youth League Committees, and Women's Federations have also moved to the countryside. County Party Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries, except for one who stays at home to manage some daily work, have moved to agricultural cooperatives to work with their luggage and office supplies. More than 90% of the county committee members and directors and deputy directors of departments and bureaus in Xiajiang County have gone deep into the production front lines, and each township is equipped with a county-level cadre to specifically guide the work of the entire township; the Ji'an County Committee has formed a "Great Leap Forward Agricultural Production Command" in Qulai Township, which is specifically responsible by Zheng Huanmin, the First Secretary of the County Committee. Except for five people left at home to take care of daily work, more than 30 other cadres have gone to the countryside.

Through this "institutional decentralization," the leading organs will be better able to get closer to reality and go deep into production.

    坚决地改进领导方法
    多接近实际多深入生产
    吉安专区各县大部分领导人员搬到农业社办公
    本报讯　江西日报消息：吉安专区党、政和人民团体领导机关，以坚强的革命意志改变领导方法，实行“机构下放”。地委农工部和生产办公室在地委第二书记赵筹和农工部长宁子明的率领下，已于1月23日搬到吉安市郊区的禾埠桥乡合并办公；宣传部、组织部和专署的有关部门，也已抽调一批较强的干部深入到禾埠桥乡的九个农业社工作。这些下乡的干部都负责培育一块试验田。各县县委农工部和办公室都已迁居农村，组织部、宣传部和团委、妇联也大部分搬到农村。县委书记和副书记除留一人在家管理一些日常工作外，其它书记都已携带自己的行李和办公用具搬到农业社办公。峡江县90％以上的县委委员和正副部、局长都已深入到生产前线，每个乡都配备了一名县级干部具体指导全乡工作；吉安县委在曲濑乡组成了一个“农业生产大跃进指挥部”，由县委第一书记郑焕民具体负责，县委除留下五个人在家照顾日常工作外，其它三十多个干部都已下到农村。
    通过这次“机构下放”，将使领导机关更好地接近实际，深入生产。
