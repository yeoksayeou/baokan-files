A Word to the Wise

    Regarding America's Rat Plague
    _Jiangsu Huaibei Salt Workers' News_  Téng Yīng

    According to reports: The January 6th issue of New York's "Newsweek" reported that America is currently suffering a major "rat plague," with large quantities of grain being destroyed by rats. The government is doing nothing, and farmers are resigned to fate, "praying for cold weather to kill the rats."  Reading this news naturally reminds me of the massive campaign to eliminate "four pests" currently underway among the people in our cities and countryside.

    Whether bourgeois gentlemen admit it or not, we say that the socialist system possesses powerful vitality.  If you don't believe it, our country can mobilize millions of people to participate in the campaign to encircle and annihilate the "four pests."  What can America do?  Our country has already seen the emergence of some "four-free" towns and villages.  Can America produce even one?  Many of our provinces and cities are confidently announcing: We will eliminate rats, sparrows, flies, mosquitoes, etc., within seven or eight years.  Does America dare to compete with us?

    Only in our country, only in a socialist country where the working people are masters, can the people and the government have such courage and determination.

    The gentlemen in the White House and the Pentagon, whose heads are filled all day with calculations of war and getting rich, have not thought of, nor are they willing, to eliminate pests for the people—to eliminate rats!  Rats and fleas have even acted as their accomplices in killing people.  People will not forget: The inhuman bacteriological warfare waged by American imperialism in Korea in 1951! At that time, rats – fleas – American imperialism formed an inextricable bond. Today, since rats have not climbed onto the heads of American politicians and generals, of course, there is no need to offend them.

    Today, Americans are taking a despairing attitude toward the rat problem, while our people are going to eliminate "four pests" and "six pests" within a few years. This in itself signifies: the vigor and vitality of our country and nation, and the enormous vitality of our socialist system!

### 关于美国的鼠祸

    关于美国的鼠祸
    江苏省淮北盐工报　滕英
    据报载：1月6日的纽约“新闻周刊”报道，美国目前正大闹“鼠祸”，大批粮食被耗子毁坏，政府不管，农民听命于天，“祈求寒冷的天气杀死老鼠”。读了这则消息，我自然地联想起目前我国城乡人民掀起的声势浩大的除“四害”运动。
    不管资产阶级先生们承认不承认，我们说，社会主义制度具有强大的生命力。不信，我们国家能动员千百万人民群众投入围歼“四害”运动，美国能做到什么呢？我国已出现一些“四无”的城镇和农村，美国能出现一个么？我国许多省、市充满信心地宣布：七、八年内消灭老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子等等，美国敢和我们比个高低么？
    只有在我们的国家里，只有在劳动人民当家作主的社会主义国家里，人民和政府才有这样的勇气和决心。
    白宫、五角大楼的先生们，成天脑袋里盘算着战争和发财，他们没想到、也不愿意去为人民除害——消灭老鼠！老鼠和跳蚤，还作过他们杀人的帮凶。人们不会忘记：1951年，美帝国主义在朝鲜进行的那场绝灭人性的细菌战！那时，老鼠—跳蚤—美帝国主义，就结下过不解的姻缘。今天老鼠又没有爬上美国政治家和将军们的脑袋上，当然是犯不着惹它的了。
    今天，美国人在应付老鼠问题上抱绝望情绪，我国人民却要在几年内消灭“四害”“六害”。这本身就意味着：我们国家和民族的朝气蓬勃，我国社会主义制度巨大的生命力！
