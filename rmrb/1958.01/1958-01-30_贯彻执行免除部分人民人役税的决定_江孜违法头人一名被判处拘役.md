Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 29th. According to the Tibet Daily: The criminal Ben Gen Que Zhu, a headman in Gyantse, who beat Tibetan student Wangjie Pingcuo for allegedly not fulfilling his corvée labor tax obligations, has been formally sentenced. Ben Gen Que Zhu and Ge Deng (Ben Gen Que Zhu's wife), who participated in the beating of Wangjie Pingcuo, were sentenced to detention, ordered to pay medical expenses, and to present a Hada (a ceremonial scarf) to Wangjie Pingcuo as an apology.

The Gyantse Jiqu-level Office, in accordance with the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region's decision to severely punish Ben Gen Que Zhu, held a sentencing rally in Gyantse on January 18th. More than 700 people, including nobles, headmen, and representatives of people's organizations, citizens, temples, institutions, and troops from the Gyantse area, attended the rally. The criminals Ben Gen Que Zhu and Ge Deng were immediately taken into custody after the sentencing. The attendees warmly applauded in support of the verdict against the two criminals.

Ci Ren Duo Jie, a representative of Tibetan cadres and students' families, spoke after the sentencing, saying: The criminal Ben Gen Que Zhu received the punishment he deserved, and our children have benefited from the exemption from corvée labor tax, so they can work and study diligently for the people with peace of mind.

People from all over Tibet and the broad masses of Tibetan cadres and students warmly support the exemption of people of all ethnic groups in Tibet who work in state organs and students from the corvée labor tax they bear to local authorities or headmen. Recently, Tibetan government employees, students, and mass organizations in various parts of Tibet have held meetings to expose the heavy corvée labor taxes that weighed on them in the past, and demand the conscientious and thorough implementation of this important resolution of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region.
