(Approved by the 192nd Administrative Council Meeting of the Government Administration Council on November 5, 1953, approved by the Chairman of the Central People's Government, and promulgated by the Government Administration Council on December 5, 1953)
(Revised at the 58th Plenary Meeting of the State Council on October 18, 1957, approved by the 90th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on January 6, 1958, and promulgated by the State Council on January 6, 1958)

Article 1: These measures are formulated to meet the needs of national construction and to handle the issue of land requisition for national construction cautiously and properly.

Article 2: When the state constructs factories, mines, railways, transportation, water conservancy, national defense and other projects, carries out cultural, educational, health, municipal and other construction, and needs to requisition land, it shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of these measures.

Article 3: Land requisition for national construction should not only be based on the actual needs of national construction, ensuring the land necessary for national construction, but also take into account the vital interests of the local people and must properly resettle those whose land is requisitioned for their production and lives. If it is temporarily impossible to resettle those whose land is requisitioned, the requisition should wait until proper resettlement is in place, or another location should be selected for requisition.

Land requisition for national construction must implement the principle of economical land use. All projects that can be postponed should not be undertaken; for projects that need to be undertaken, strict calculations must be made when requisitioning land, strictly adhering to design quotas, controlling building density, preventing excessive or premature requisition, and eliminating land waste. Where wasteland, inferior land, and vacant land can be utilized, they should be utilized as much as possible; cultivated land and fertile fields should be requisitioned as little as possible, and houses should be demolished as little as possible.

Article 4: For land requisition, the agency authorized to approve the preliminary design of the construction project shall be responsible for approving the amount of land to be used, and then the land-using unit shall apply to the provincial people's committee of the land's location for one or more allocations; for construction projects requiring less than 300 mu of land and relocating less than 30 households, application can be made to the county-level people's committee of the land's location for allocation.

When applying for land allocation, the land-using unit must submit a land requisition application (detailing the land's jurisdiction, location, and approved quantity), along with a compensation and resettlement plan for those whose land is requisitioned, as well as approved preliminary design documents for the construction project (with a site plan), construction schedule documents, and the written opinions of the county-level or township people's committee of the land's location; however, when applying for land allocation for railway and highway routes and national defense projects, if submitting certain of the above attachments is indeed difficult, it may be waived or supplemented later with the consent of the agency that approved the land quantity.

Article 5: After the land is allocated, the land-using unit should, in conjunction with the local people's committee, explain to the masses, announce the specific measures for compensating and resettling those whose land is requisitioned, and give them the necessary preparation time, so that the masses consciously obey the interests of the state and the long-term interests of the people, with their current immediate interests being properly taken care of, before formally determining the land requisition and proceeding with construction. If a large amount of land is requisitioned, a large number of residents are relocated, or even an entire village is relocated, thorough preparatory work should first be done among the local masses, and then the relevant land requisition issues should be submitted to the local people's congress for discussion and resolution.

Article 6: In the event of temporary emergency rescue or urgent land use, if there is not enough time to fully comply with the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of these measures in advance, construction may commence on the land first, while completing the land requisition procedures as soon as possible and explaining to the masses.

Article 7: Land requisition should, as far as possible, be adjusted using state-owned and collectively-owned land. If adjustment is not possible, or if adjustment affects the production and lives of those whose land is requisitioned, compensation or subsidies should be paid.

The compensation for land requisition shall be jointly assessed by the local people's committee, the land-using unit, and those whose land is requisitioned. For general land, the standard shall be the total value of its fixed output for the most recent two to four years; for special land such as tea plantations, tung oil tree plantations, fish ponds, lotus ponds, mulberry gardens, bamboo forests, and reed marshes, flexible handling may be adopted based on the specific circumstances.

In the event that houses must be demolished due to land requisition, equivalent housing should be provided to the original residents to ensure that they have housing to live in, or compensation should be paid to the homeowners in accordance with fair and reasonable principles.

Compensation should be paid in accordance with fair and reasonable principles for wells, trees, and other objects and crops on the requisitioned land.

Article 8: The compensation or subsidies for land requisition, as well as compensation for houses, wells, trees, and other attachments and crops on the land, shall be paid by the land-using unit.

For requisitioned land of agricultural production cooperatives, land compensation or subsidies shall be paid to the cooperative; for requisitioned privately-owned land, compensation or subsidies shall be paid to the owner. Attachments and crops on the land belonging to agricultural production cooperatives shall be compensated to the cooperative; those belonging to private owners shall be compensated to the owner.

Article 9: If the members' congress or members' representative congress of an agricultural production cooperative believes that land requisition has no impact on the lives of the members and does not require compensation, and with the consent of the local county-level people's committee, compensation may not be paid.

For requisitioned land of non-members used by agricultural production cooperatives, if the land owner does not engage in agricultural production and does not rely on land income to maintain their livelihood, compensation may not be paid, but must be with the consent of the owner.

Article 10: When requisitioning the foundations of houses in urban areas, if the house and foundation belong to the same person, the foundation portion will not be compensated separately; if they belong to two different people, compensation may be given at the discretion of the circumstances of the foundation owner.

Vacant land within urban areas that generates no income may be requisitioned without compensation.

Article 11: When the land-using unit conducts measurement and exploration of the land to be requisitioned, it should first obtain the consent of the local people's committee and the land owner. If measurement and exploration cause losses to the land owner, appropriate compensation should be given.

Article 12: If the land-using unit or construction unit needs to temporarily use land outside the requisitioned area as a place for storing materials and transportation roads during construction, it may rent or borrow it after consulting with the local people's committee and the land owner. If the land that has not been requisitioned suffers losses due to the construction project, the land-using unit or construction unit should give the land owner due compensation.

Article 13: For farmers who need to be resettled due to land requisition, the local township or county-level people's committee should be responsible for resettling them in agriculture locally as much as possible; for those who cannot be resettled in agriculture, the labor and civil affairs departments of the local county-level or higher people's committee should, in conjunction with the land-using unit, find ways to resettle them in other aspects locally; for those who cannot be resettled locally in agriculture or in other aspects, immigration can be organized. The organization of immigration should be jointly responsible by the county-level or higher people's committees of the relocation and receiving areas. Immigration expenses shall be paid by the land-using unit.

Article 14: The ownership of land that has been requisitioned belongs to the state. The land-using unit should draw up a map and register of the requisitioned land in duplicate, submit it to the local county or city people's committee for review and seal, one copy to be kept by the county or city people's committee for reference, and one copy to be kept by the land-using unit itself.

Article 15: If the land that has been requisitioned is not used or not fully used by the land-using unit due to changes in plans or other reasons, the unused or surplus land must be handed over to the local county-level people's committee for allocation to other land-using units or for farmers to cultivate.

If the requisitioned land is temporarily not used during the planting season of a crop, it should be handed over to the farmers to continue cultivation, provided that it does not hinder construction purposes. For land with crops growing on it, it should be used as late as possible until after the harvest.

Article 16: When graves within the requisitioned land need to be moved, the local people's committee shall notify the grave owner to move them. The land-using unit should issue appropriate relocation fees and properly handle them, taking into account local customs and habits. Unowned graves shall be relocated by the land-using unit on behalf of the owners. If there is no land for relocation, the local people's committee shall assist in finding land for relocation. The relocation of martyrs' graves should be notified to the local county-level or higher people's committee.

If there are cultural relics and places of scenic interest and historical value within the requisitioned land that are worth preserving, the land-using unit and the construction unit should properly handle them in conjunction with the cultural departments of the county-level or higher people's committee and be responsible for protecting them.

Article 17: During the construction of the project, the land-using unit or construction unit should properly handle the water sources, canals, transportation, etc. that are closely related to the production and life of the local people in conjunction with the local people's committee, and should not easily block or damage them.

Article 18: State construction requires the use of state-owned and collectively-owned land, and applications for allocation should be made in accordance with the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of these measures, and explanations should be given to the masses.

When allocating state-owned and collectively-owned land cultivated by farmers, appropriate subsidies may be given by the land-using unit based on their living conditions. Compensation for attachments and crops on the land and resettlement of the farmers who originally cultivated the land shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of Articles 7 and 13 of these measures, respectively.

When allocating state-owned and collectively-owned land currently used by state organs, troops, enterprises, schools, people's organizations, and other units, the issues of housing and land foundations, etc. necessary for the relocation of the original user unit shall be handled by the local county-level or higher people's committee in conjunction with the applicant land-using unit and the original user unit, in accordance with the principles of consolidating land and housing use and saving state financial expenditure. If the original user unit can solve the problem on its own, it should try to solve it on its own; if the original user unit cannot solve it on its own, it should try to solve it through exchange and adjustment; if exchange and adjustment are not possible, the applicant land-using unit shall provide appropriate compensation.

Article 19: If the public welfare undertakings originally funded by the income from collectively-owned land still need to be continued after the land is allocated, but the funding is not available, the local people's committee should allocate funds from the departmental operating expenses of the competent department according to the nature of the undertaking; if it is impossible to allocate funds, it should promptly report to the higher-level people's committee for resolution.

Article 20: Public-private joint ventures, credit cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, handicraft production cooperatives, and public welfare undertakings run by the masses can apply to the local county-level or higher people's committee. After obtaining approval, the provisions of these measures shall be applied.

Article 21: County-level or higher people's committees and the superior authorities of land-using units should regularly supervise and inspect the use of the land that has been requisitioned. If it is found that land-using units and construction units have violated the provisions of these measures, wasting land and harming the interests of the masses, they should be corrected in a timely manner, and if the circumstances are serious, responsibility should be investigated and dealt with seriously. Land that has been requisitioned but not used and surplus land must be recovered in a timely manner, provided that it does not hinder construction purposes.

County-level or higher people's committees should regularly summarize and report the situation and problems of land requisition.

Article 22: The people's committees of each province can formulate implementation measures based on the provisions of these measures and in combination with the specific circumstances of the local area, and report them to the State Council for the record.

The autonomous organs of ethnic autonomous areas may formulate methods for land requisition in their regions based on the specific circumstances of the local area and with reference to the basic principles stipulated in these measures; they may also handle matters mutatis mutandis with reference to these measures.
