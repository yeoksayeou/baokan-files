The Crazy Atrocities of the Syngman Rhee Clique
A commentator from this newspaper
The Syngman Rhee clique is once again carrying out a large-scale suppression of the South Korean people. In just forty days, it has arrested and detained over ten thousand people under various "charges." What does the Syngman Rhee clique's adoption of such insane fascist measures against innocent people signify? It certainly does not indicate that the Syngman Rhee clique is powerful, but only that this small court is extremely unstable and is facing increasingly strong resistance from the South Korean people, to the point where it has to rely on prisons and bayonets for support.

In recent years, the South Korean people have lived an extraordinarily painful and miserable life under the tyrannical rule of the Syngman Rhee clique. The Syngman Rhee clique willingly acts as a war tool for the American aggressors, desperately expanding its military and preparing for war, reducing the South Korean countryside to poverty and exhaustion, with reduced grain production, while urban industrial production has almost completely ground to a halt. As a result, among the twenty-three million people in South Korea, the number of unemployed has reached three million, many farmers have to sustain their lives with grass roots and tree bark, and many city residents have to fill their stomachs with bean dregs and chaff. At the same time, the South Korean people's political rights have been completely deprived, and their urgent desire for peaceful reunification of Korea in order to live a peaceful life cannot be realized at all. Instead, they are forcibly conscripted by the Syngman Rhee clique. The South Korean people have long been unable to tolerate this situation of utter misery. Throughout South Korea, incidents of resistance to conscription, resistance to grain taxes, and strikes are constantly emerging. This shows that despite the Syngman Rhee clique's use of the most barbaric means of repression, the South Korean people still dare to rise up and fight against it.

Faced with the increasingly strong resistance of the South Korean people, the Syngman Rhee clique is very worried that it will be ousted in the upcoming National Assembly elections. Therefore, while stepping up its fascist measures of arrest and suppression against the people, it is also intensifying its attacks on opposition parties in the National Assembly. Cho Bong-am and Kim Dal-ho, leaders of the South Korean Progressive Party, were recently arrested by the Syngman Rhee clique's police simply for expressing views advocating peaceful reunification of Korea. The Syngman Rhee clique has also announced that these arrested opposition leaders will not be allowed to participate in the new National Assembly elections. Therefore, it is not difficult to see that the targets of the Syngman Rhee clique's crackdown this time are the kind and well-meaning people who are dissatisfied with the tyrannical rule of the Syngman Rhee clique, people from all walks of life who advocate peaceful reunification of Korea and oppose the Syngman Rhee clique's pursuit of American war policies, and the leaders of opposition parties who hold different political views from Syngman Rhee; its real intention is to clear the way for Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party to control the new National Assembly elections in order to maintain its unpopular and sinful rule in South Korea.

Not only that, but in order to ensure that it can continue to control the new National Assembly without fail, the Syngman Rhee clique recently also manipulated the South Korean National Assembly to pass an extremely reactionary so-called election law. This election law openly stipulates that freedom of speech, publication, and assembly is prohibited, and all publications are not allowed to publish speeches opposing the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique or exposing the darkness of the Syngman Rhee regime. That is to say, in South Korea, any remaining basic rights of the people have been completely deprived, and everything must be subject to the Syngman Rhee clique, a scourge of the country and the people, raised by the United States.

However, the greater the pressure from the Syngman Rhee clique, the stronger the resistance from the South Korean people. These reactionary measures of the Syngman Rhee clique have aroused widespread opposition from all walks of life in South Korea. The South Korean press and the Progressive Party, the Democratic Reform Party, and others, all oppose the Syngman Rhee clique's practice of depriving the people of their basic rights and call on the people to rise up and fight. This struggle of the South Korean people has received the sympathy and support of the press and cultural circles of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It is obvious that the Syngman Rhee clique's brutal suppression of the South Korean people will only make it more isolated and ultimately be resolutely abandoned by the South Korean people.

    李承晚集团的疯狂暴行
    本报评论员
    李承晚集团又在对南朝鲜人民进行大规模的镇压了。仅在四十天内，它就用各种“罪名”逮捕和拘禁了一万多人。李承晚集团对无辜人民采取这样疯狂的法西斯措施说明了什么呢？这决不是表现李承晚集团有力量，而只能说明这个小朝廷十分不稳固，正在遭到南朝鲜人民越来越强烈的反抗，以致它不得不依靠监牢和刺刀来支持。
    这些年来，南朝鲜人民在李承晚集团的暴虐统治下，过着异常痛苦和悲惨的生活。李承晚集团甘愿充当美国侵略者的战争工具，拚命扩军备战，把南朝鲜农村弄得民穷财尽，粮食减产，而城市工业生产更几乎完全陷于停顿。因此，在南朝鲜二千三百万人口中，失业人数达到了三百万，许多农民不得不以草根树皮维持生命，许多城市居民不得不以豆渣和糟糠充饥。同时，南朝鲜人民的政治权利完全被剥夺，他们要求和平统一朝鲜以便过和平生活的迫切愿望，根本无法实现，反而被李承晚集团硬逼着当兵。对于这种水深火热的情况，南朝鲜人民早就无法容忍下去了。在南朝鲜各地，反抗当兵、抗粮抗税和罢工的事件，层出不穷。这说明，尽管李承晚集团使用最野蛮的高压手段，南朝鲜人民仍然敢于起来同它进行斗争。
    面对着南朝鲜人民日益强烈的反抗，李承晚集团十分耽心它在不久就要举行的国会选举中被撵下台来。因此，它在加紧对人民采取逮捕、镇压等法西斯手段的同时，对在国会中的反对党派也在加紧进行打击。南朝鲜进步党首领曹奉岩、金达镐等人，只因发表过主张和平统一朝鲜的言论，最近也被李承晚集团的警察逮捕了。李承晚集团并且宣布，这些被捕的反对党首领们，将不准参加新的国会选举。因此，不难看到，李承晚集团这次打击的对象，是那些对李承晚集团的暴虐统治心怀不满的善良人民，是那些主张和平统一朝鲜和反对李承晚集团追随美国战争政策的各界人士，是那些同李承晚抱有不同政见的反对党的首领人物；其真实意图，是为李承晚的自由党控制新的国会选举扫清道路，以保持它在南朝鲜的不得人心的罪恶统治。
    不仅这样。李承晚集团为了保证它能万无一失地继续控制新的国会，在最近还操纵南朝鲜国会通过了一项反动透顶的所谓选举法。这个选举法，公然规定禁止言论、出版、集会自由，一切刊物都不准刊登反对美国和李承晚集团以及揭露李承晚政权黑暗的言论。这就是说，在南朝鲜，人民的任何一点残存的基本权利都被剥夺尽净了，一切都得听命于美国豢养下的祸国殃民的李承晚集团。
    但是，李承晚集团的压力愈大，南朝鲜人民的反抗情绪也愈强烈。李承晚集团的这些反动措施，已经激起了南朝鲜各界人士的普遍反对。南朝鲜新闻界和进步党、民主革新党等，都反对李承晚集团剥夺人民基本权利的作法，并号召人民起来斗争。南朝鲜人民的这一斗争，已经得到了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的新闻界和文化界人士的同情和声援。显而易见，李承晚集团对南朝鲜人民的残暴镇压，只会使它自己更加陷于孤立，最后被南朝鲜人民坚决地抛弃掉。
