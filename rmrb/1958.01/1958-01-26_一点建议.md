Reader's Column:

    A Little Suggestion
    I would like to offer a suggestion: Universities and colleges should enroll a large number of children from worker and peasant families, and resolutely eliminate the erroneous idea that admitting more children from worker and peasant families will affect the quality of teaching. When admitting students, they should be admitted as long as they meet the minimum admission standards. Oppose the bad practice of excluding worker and peasant students, and resolutely implement the class line.
    I hope that teachers in universities and colleges will not be afraid of trouble, and will take the cultivation of worker and peasant students and the expansion of the working class's own scientific and technological ranks as a glorious task to be completed.　Su Jianguo

    一点建议
    我提出一点建议：高等学校要大量的吸收工农子弟入学，坚决破除多吸收工农子弟怕影响教学质量的错误思想。在录取学生时，只要达到录取的最低标准就可吸收。反对排斥工农学生的坏作风，坚决贯彻阶级路线。
    希望高等学校的教师们不要怕麻烦，要把培养工农学生，壮大工人阶级自己的科学技术队伍，当做一个光荣的任务来完成。　苏建国
