Good Leadership Methods, Brilliant Construction Achievements
    —Introducing the Basic Experience of the CPC Wushan County Committee in Leading Production

    (Continued from yesterday)

    Everything for the Masses, Firmly Believe in the Masses
    Wushan County encountered many difficulties in developing production and building the countryside. Sometimes there was a lack of money, sometimes a lack of people, and sometimes a lack of technology. When the county committee encountered this situation, they did not complain to the higher authorities or ask for money, nor did they even consider doing so. What they thought of was the masses. They absolutely believed in the wisdom and strength of the masses, and based on the principle of diligence and thrift, actively mobilized and led the masses to handle their own affairs. In this regard, Wushan County had three particularly prominent aspects.
    First, a consistently clear viewpoint of serving the masses. The county committee understood that to make the masses believe in every activity of the Party, it must be to relieve them of all suffering and to achieve a better life. In this regard, in addition to grasping the most basic aspect, namely actively leading the masses to increase grain production, the county committee also attached importance to improving the lives of the masses from small details. Last spring, in order to understand the living conditions of the people in the mountainous areas, the county committee organized two working groups, led by the county party secretary and the county head, to visit the northern and southern mountainous areas. In the southern mountainous area, it was discovered that farmers carried manure on their backs, which was both laborious and inefficient, affecting the rapid expansion of the fertilization area. The working group attached great importance to this matter, studied it with the farmers, and established many fertilizer accumulation stations. In spring, summer, and autumn, livestock were concentrated outside the village overnight, and the manure was accumulated not far from the ground. This made fertilization very convenient, reduced the labor intensity of farmers when transporting manure, and expanded the fertilization area. In the northern mountainous area, it was discovered that the farmers in Jinyin Township still had to carry water from far down the mountain, and it was even bitter water. The comrades in the working group asked the farmers what their demands were. The farmers said, "We have everything, except water. Our liberation is not yet complete. Help us find water!" The working group immediately sent Li Hua, deputy director of the county water conservancy section, to live there to help the farmers find water. When Li Hua mobilized everyone to dig a well, the farmers said that no one had ever found water digging wells for generations and refused to do it. Li Hua had no choice but to dig the well himself, and finally, water was found. The farmers could not help but shout, "Long live the Communist Party!" Then, Jinyin Township set off a wave of well-digging and cellar-building for water storage, not only solving the difficulty of drinking water but also proposing a plan to realize water conservancy. The county committee even cared about the farmers' flour-milling problems. For many years, the farmers in Yupan Town used dry mills to grind flour. Because there were few livestock, most of them pushed the mill by hand. After learning about this situation, the county committee immediately sent people to help the farmers repair two water mills, freeing many people from heavy labor. Similar things like this were common in Wushan County. It was precisely because the county committee not only cared about the interests of the masses in big matters but also sought welfare for the masses in small matters, that it established a high prestige among the masses. Therefore, when the county committee called on the masses to do something, it could be completed quickly.
    Second, resolutely believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses and boldly rely on the strength of the masses to run all undertakings. This requires not only a clear viewpoint of serving the masses but also revolutionary courage. The Dongliang Canal, built by leading the masses in the past two years, is an example of the county committee's practice in this regard. The Dongliang Canal starts from Yunwu Mountain (water source) in the south and ends in Luomen in the north, with a total length of sixty li. The canal runs on a high mountain with an elevation of 1,912 meters, an average elevation of 1,730 meters, and a relative height of 250 meters. The canal had to pass through twenty-four mountain streams, cross four forests, and cross many cliffs. The entire project required digging 300,000 cubic meters of earth, building 60 drop structures, building 18 culverts and flood bridges, and digging more than 100 meters of underground culverts. According to the formal construction method, completing this large project required many conditions. For example, accurate topographical surveys, key geological exploration data, complete designs, strong construction management, and a large number of building materials. At that time, water conservancy engineering technicians who visited the construction site believed that even if the aforementioned conditions were met, it would still be difficult to complete the canal. Obviously, this task was arduous. So, what construction conditions did Wushan County have? All there was were two water conservancy section chiefs who had not studied water conservancy, a level instrument, and tens of thousands of farmers. In order to allow the people in the mountainous areas to get rid of the threat of drought forever and to pave the way for water conservancy in the mountainous areas, the county committee was determined to complete the canal. They believed that as long as they relied on the masses, there would be no difficulties that could not be overcome. They did not ask the province or the special commissioner's office for a single person, a single yuan, or a single jin of material, and they led the farmers to start construction. In the process of building the canal, whenever technical problems were encountered, they consulted with the farmers, and as a result, the canal was completed, not only saving a lot of investment but also cultivating a set of water conservancy technical talents. The Dongliang Canal has become a glorious banner of relying on the masses to realize water conservancy in mountainous areas.
    Third, constantly educate cadres to follow this path to carry out various tasks. On the one hand, the county committee relied on the strength of the masses to complete tasks such as running primary schools, building water conservancy projects, establishing broadcasting networks, and building small hydropower stations; on the other hand, it constantly educated cadres throughout the county to implement this policy in all their work. The county committee always seized every opportunity to educate cadres to care about the suffering of the masses, pay attention to the demands of the masses, support the masses' even small socialist enthusiasm, believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses, and consult with the masses when encountering difficulties. Therefore, the cadres of Wushan County have become accustomed to using this working method. Last spring, in order to guarantee increased production, the county launched a "Rationalization Proposal Movement Month." At this time, many cadres were able to actively and proactively mobilize the masses to make suggestions, which achieved good results and found a large number of measures to increase production. For example, Li Xuding and five others in the Chengguan area put forward more than ten suggestions, which increased grain production by more than 100,000 jin.
    It is precisely because the county committee insisted on adopting this working method that no matter what it did, it always conformed to the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical," which not only saved the state's funds but also accelerated the development of various undertakings. Based on past experience, the "Five Transformations" task they have put forward this time will also be completed entirely by relying on the masses.

    Grasp Organizational Construction, Pay Attention to Ideological Education
    The Wushan County Committee attached great importance to the Party's organizational construction and ideological construction, trying to give full play to the Party organization's role as a fighting fortress in production and the exemplary role of Party members, and constantly strengthened the political and ideological education of farmers through the Party's grassroots organizations. This ensured that the Party's policies could be quickly implemented among the masses.
    The county committee's development of Party work is constant. At present, there are more than 5,500 Party members in the county, and each agricultural cooperative has a Party branch, and each production team has a Party group. The county committee has always grasped the ideological education of Party members. There are two ways to educate. One is to improve the organizational life system, hold Party meetings on time, conduct criticism and self-criticism, overcome shortcomings in the ideological style of Party members, and establish a card system to record the advantages and disadvantages of each Party member, and then conduct inspections through organizational life to see the progress of each Party member. The other is to establish night Party schools to conduct systematic ideological education for Party members. All forty townships in the county have night Party schools, with large townships having two or three, composed of the general branch (or branch) secretary and propaganda committee member forming the school affairs committee. The branch of the agricultural cooperative is the branch school, and the group of the production team is the class. Each night Party school selects comrades with good ideology, theoretical level, and cultural level to serve as instructors. The time for classes is not unified, some once a week, some once every ten days. The teaching content is divided into three parts: (1) Party construction, including the Party Constitution and teaching materials for branch work; (2) Combined with the central work, study the Party's current policies; (3) Combined with the education of Party members' self-cultivation, expose and criticize bad tendencies within the Party. Night Party schools also absorb non-Party masses to participate, most of whom are development targets. In short, the guiding principle of the night Party school is to combine organizational construction, ideological construction with current tasks.
    In order to enable Party members to connect with the masses, in daily organizational life and night Party schools, Party members are often educated on three things: The first thing is to play an exemplary role in various tasks and take the lead in doing a good job in production; the second thing is to humbly learn from the masses, such as when launching the suggestion campaign last spring, calling on Party members to visit old farmers' homes to ask for suggestions; the third thing is to learn a skill, such as accumulating fertilizer, raising pigs, water and soil conservation, repairing canals, and afforestation, so as to set an example for the masses. Through the above work, Party members are very active in various undertakings. For example, among the hundreds of model figures that have emerged in the county, Party members account for about 80%.
    With a sound Party organization and Party members who can play an exemplary role in various tasks, the county committee can regularly and timely strengthen the political and ideological education of the masses through the Party organization. The publicity for any movement or work can be carried out with a concentrated and powerful force. Last spring, due to the opening of the rural free market and the spread of rightist remarks from the cities to the countryside, capitalist ideas in agricultural cooperatives were on the rise. Some people doubted the superiority of cooperativization, rich middle peasants shouted that cooperatives were not free, and some women were also blinded and followed suit, saying that they had no donkeys to ride when they went to their mothers' homes. The prevalence of these erroneous remarks had affected production to a certain extent. Therefore, the county committee mobilized Party grassroots organizations, absorbed some activists to participate, and launched a massive "Publicity Movement Month" throughout the county, laying out countless facts to prove the superiority of cooperativization, criticizing capitalist ideas, holding the line on cooperativization, and raising the farmers' enthusiasm for production, ensuring last year's bumper harvest.

    Always Forward!
    Summarizing the basic experience of the Wushan County Committee in leading rural production and construction is: production is above all else, a clear production viewpoint; a practical, in-depth, and mass-oriented working style; a working line and method of caring about the interests of the masses, believing in the wisdom and strength of the masses, and relying on the masses to run all undertakings; strengthening the Party's organizational construction and ideological construction, and giving full play to the Party organization's guarantee role in various undertakings. This has firmly laid the foundation for developing all undertakings. Since liberation, although Wushan has suffered two major droughts, production and construction undertakings have continued to advance.
    What is even more valuable is that, through the aforementioned work, a normal socialist order has been established in the countryside. The characteristics of this order are: all-round economic development, flourishing cultural undertakings, close ties between leaders and the masses, sound and active Party organizations, stable political ideology, consistently high farmers' enthusiasm for production, and basically consolidated agricultural cooperatives. With this order, all work can be carried out quickly. With this order, every call of the Party will immediately turn into the practical actions of thousands of people. With this order, it is possible to smoothly overcome various difficulties on the road to advancement.
    Taking the water conservancy construction movement launched last winter as an example. The county originally planned to basically realize water conservancy in three and a half years and called on the masses to discuss it. At this time, the farmers in Heping Township, based on a great debate, proposed measures to realize water conservancy in two years and challenged the entire county. The county committee seized on this fact and, at the "Three Cadres" meeting held in early November, called on everyone to learn from Heping Township. After discussion by the cadres attending the meeting, the time for realizing water conservancy throughout the county was advanced by one and a half years. After this news spread, everyone donated money, and now agencies, schools, and agricultural cooperatives have donated more than 200,000 yuan, as well as a large number of tools and voluntary labor workdays. Now, the three major projects of the West Liang Canal, the Middle Liang Canal, and the North Liang Canal have started construction in the county. The county has not asked the higher authorities for people, money, or materials, and is completely relying on the strength of the masses. The farmers said, "If the water doesn't go up the mountain, people won't go down the mountain. We will work hard for three years to resolutely change the natural appearance of Wushan County and forever defeat natural disasters!"
    Currently, the most urgent task facing the Wushan County Committee is: on the basis of past work, make full use of existing favorable conditions, seize the momentum of the production upsurge, strengthen the rectification work in the midst of great contending and great blooming, formulate the county's production and construction plan based on the results of the masses' discussion of the "National Agricultural Development Program" forty articles, take more active measures, make great strides in various tasks, achieve the tasks stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program" ahead of schedule, and further improve the people's material and cultural life!

    良好的领导方法　辉煌的建设成就
    ——介绍中共武山县委领导生产的基本经验

    （续昨）
    一切为了群众  坚决相信群众
    武山县在发展生产、建设农村过程中，曾遇到过不少困难，有时缺钱，有时缺人，有时缺少技术。县委遇到这种情况，没有向上边叫过苦，伸手要过钱，也没有这种想法。他们所想到的是群众。他们绝对相信群众的智慧和力量，根据勤俭的原则，积极发动和领导群众动手办自己的事。武山县在这方面，有三点表现的最突出。
    第一，一贯明确的为群众服务的观点。县委懂得：要使群众相信党的每一个活动，都在于使他们解脱一切疾苦、获得更美好的生活。在这方面，县委除了抓住最基本的方面即积极领导群众增产粮食外，还重视从细小的地方去改善群众的生活状况。去年春天，县委为了了解山区人民的生活情形，组织了两个工作组，由县委书记、县长率领，分赴南北山区进行访问。在南山区，发现农民送粪时用人背，既吃力，效率又低，影响到施肥面积不能迅速扩大。工作组非常重视这件事，同农民研究，建立了许多积肥站。春、夏、秋三季，集中牲口在村外过夜，把粪积在离地不远的地方。这样，施肥很方便，减轻了农民送粪时的劳动强度，扩大了施肥面积。在北山区，发现金银乡的农民直到现在仍到很远的山下担水吃，而且是苦水。工作组的同志问农民有什么要求。农民说：“什么都有，就是没有水吃，翻身还是不彻底，帮助我们找水吧！”工作组即派县水利科副科长李华住在那里，帮助农民找水。当李华动员大家打井时，农民说祖祖辈辈都没有打出过水，不干。李华没有办法了，只好自己动手打井，终于把水打出来了。农民情不自禁地高呼：“共产党万岁！”接着，金银乡掀起了打井、打窖蓄水的热潮，不但解决了吃水的困难，而且提出了实现水利化的计划。县委甚至关心农民磨面的问题。榆盘镇的农民，多少年来都是用旱磨磨面。由于牲口少，大都用人推磨。县委了解这种情况以后，立即派人去，帮助农民修了两盘水磨，把很多人从沉重的劳动中解放出来了。类似这样的事情在武山县是很多的。正由于县委不仅在大事情上关心群众的利益，而且在小事情上为群众谋福利，就在群众中树立了很高的威信。所以，当县委号召群众做一件事情的时候，都能迅速完成。
    第二，坚决相信群众的智慧和力量，大胆地依靠群众力量去办一切事业。这不单要有明确为群众服务的观点，还要有革命的魄力。前年和去年领导群众修成的东梁渠，就是县委在这方面实践的范例。东梁渠南起云雾山（水源）北至洛门，全长六十华里。渠道走行在拔海一千九百一十二公尺、平均拔高一千七百三十公尺、比高二百五十公尺的高山上。渠道要通过二十四条山涧，穿过四座森林，跨过许多悬崖峭壁。整个工程要挖土三十万立方公尺，修跌水六十座，筑涵洞和渡洪桥十八座，打暗渠一百多公尺。依照正规的施工方法，完成这项大工程，需要很多条件。例如，精确的地形测量，重点地质勘探资料，完整的设计，较强的施工管理，大量的建筑材料。当时，到工地参观的水利工程技术人员，认为纵然具备了前述条件，想把渠修成仍然是困难的。很显然，这个任务是艰巨的。那么，武山县具备哪些施工条件呢？所有的是两名没有学过水利的水利科长、一台水平仪、成千上万个农民。县委为了让山区人民永远摆脱干旱的威胁，给山区水利化打出一条道路，下定了把渠修通的决心。他们相信，只要依靠群众，没有克服不了的困难。他们没有向省、专署要一个人、一元钱、一斤材料，便领着农民动工了。在修渠过程中，每遇到技术问题，就找农民商量，结果把渠修通了，不但节省了大量的投资，而且培养了一套水利技术人材。东梁渠成为依靠群众实现山区水利化一面光辉的旗帜。
    第三，经常教育干部遵循这条道路开展各项工作。县委一方面在办小学、兴修水利、建立广播网、修建小型水电站等方面依靠群众力量去完成；另一方面，经常教育全县干部在任何工作中都贯彻这个方针。县委总是利用任何机会教育干部关心群众的疾苦，重视群众的要求，支持群众那怕是微小的社会主义积极性，相信群众的智慧和力量，遇到困难同群众商量。所以，武山县的干部，已习惯运用这一工作方法了。去年春天，为了保证增产，全县开展了“合理化建议运动月”。这时，许多干部都能主动、积极地去发动群众提建议，收到很好的效果，找到了大量的增产措施。如城关片黎绪定等六人，提出了十多条建议，就增产粮食十余万斤。
    正由于县委坚持采用这一工作方法，所以不论办什么事情，总是符合于“多、快、好、省”这一方针的，既节省了国家的资金，又加快了各项事业的发展速度。他们这次提出的“五化”的任务，根据过去的经验，也将完全依靠群众完成。
    抓紧组织建设  注意思想教育
    武山县委十分重视党的组织建设和思想建设，设法充分发挥党组织在生产中的堡垒作用和党员的带头作用，并通过党的基层组织不断加强农民的政治思想教育。这就保证党的政策能够很快地贯彻到群众中去。
    县委发展党的工作是经常的。现在，全县有五千五百多名党员，每个农业社都有党支部，每个生产队都有党小组。县委一直抓紧对党员的思想教育工作。教育的方法有两种。一种是健全组织生活制度，按时召开党的会议，进行批评和自我批评，克服党员思想作风上的缺点，并且建立卡片制度，记载每一个党员的优缺点，而后通过组织生活进行检查，看每个党员的进步情况。另一种，建立夜党校，对党员进行系统的思想教育。全县四十个乡都有夜党校，大的乡有两个或者三个，由总支（或支部）书记、宣传委员组成校务委员会。农业社的支部为分校，生产队的小组为班。各夜党校都选择思想好、理论水平和文化水平高的同志作辅导员。上课的时间不作统一规定，有的一星期一次，有的十天一次。授课内容分三个部分：（一）党的建设，包括党章、支部工作教材；（二）结合中心工作，学习党的当前政策；
  （三）结合党员修养的教育，揭发批判党内不良倾向。夜党校也吸收非党群众参加，他们大都是发展对象。总之，夜党校的方针是把组织建设、思想建设同当前任务结合起来。
    为了使党员能够联系群众，在日常组织生活和夜党校里，经常教育党员三件事：第一件，要在各项工作中起模范作用，带头搞好生产；第二件，虚心向群众学习，如像去春开展献计运动时，号召党员到老农民家里登门求计；第三件，学会一样本事，如积肥、养猪、水土保持、修渠、造林等，以便给群众作榜样。经过上述这些工作，党员在各项事业中非常活跃。例如，全县出现的几百名模范人物中，党员即占80％左右。
    有了健全的党的组织，有了能够在各项工作中起模范作用的党员，县委就可以通过党的组织经常地、及时地加强对群众的政治思想教育。对任何一个运动、一个工作的宣传，都能集中强大的力量去进行。去年春天，由于农村自由市场开放，由于城市中的右派言论传到了农村，农业社里的资本主义思想抬头了。有人怀疑合作化的优越性，富裕中农大喊合作社不自由，有些妇女被蒙蔽也跟着叫走娘家没有驴骑了。这些错误言论的流行，曾在一定程度上影响了生产。因此，县委动员党的各基层组织，吸收一部分积极分子参加，在全县掀起了声势浩大的“宣传运动月”，摆出无数事实证明合作化的优越性，批判了资本主义思想，把住了合作化这一关，提高了农民的生产热情，保证了去年的丰收。
    永远前进！
    概括武山县委领导农村生产建设的基本经验是：生产高于一切，明确的生产观点；踏实的、深入实际的、联系群众的工作作风；关心群众利益、相信群众智慧和力量、依靠群众办一切事业的工作路线和方法；加强党的组织建设和思想建设，充分发挥党组织在各种事业中的保证作用。这就牢固地奠定了发展一切事业的基础。解放以后，武山虽遭到两次大旱，然而生产、建设事业仍然不停地前进。
    更可贵的是，通过前述工作，在农村中建立了社会主义正常的秩序。这个秩序的特点是：经济的全面发展，文化事业的繁荣，领导同群众间的密切联系，党的组织健全而又活跃，政治思想的稳定，农民生产积极性一直高涨，农业合作社基本巩固。有了这个秩序，一切工作都可以迅速展开。有了这个秩序，党的每一个号召，立即会变成千万人的实际行动。有了这个秩序，就可以顺利地战胜前进道路上的各种困难。
    以去冬开展的兴修水利运动为例。县里原计划用三年半的时间基本实现水利化，号召群众讨论。这时，和平乡的农民，在大辩论的基础上，提出两年实现水利化的措施，并向全县挑战。县委抓住这个事实，在11月初召开的“三干”会上，号召大家向和平乡看齐。经过到会干部的讨论，结果把实现全县水利化的时间提前了一年半。这个消息传出去后，大家纷纷捐款，现在各机关、学校、农业社已捐款二十多万元，另有大批工具和义务劳动工作日。现在，全县已有西梁渠、中梁渠、北梁渠三大工程开工了。县里也没有向上边要人、要钱、要材料，完全依靠群众的力量。农民们说：“水不上山，人不下山，拚上过三年艰苦生活，坚决改变武山县的自然面貌，永远战胜天灾！”
    当前，摆在武山县委面前最迫切的任务是：在过去工作的基础上，充分利用已有的有利条件，抓住生产高潮的矛头，加强大鸣大放中的整改工作，根据群众讨论“全国农业发展纲要”四十条的结果，制定全县的生产建设规划，采取更积极的措施，使各种工作大踏步地前进，提前实现“全国农业发展纲要”规定的任务，进一步提高人民的物质、文化生活！
