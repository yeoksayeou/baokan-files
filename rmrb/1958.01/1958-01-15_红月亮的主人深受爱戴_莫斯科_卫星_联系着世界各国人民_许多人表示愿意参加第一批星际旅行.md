Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 13th: Since the Soviet Union launched artificial satellites, the "Moscow-Satellite" communications center has become famous worldwide. It receives daily letters from workers, farmers, employees, scholars, and young people from all corners of the globe, filled with congratulations and hopes for the Soviet Union's launch of artificial satellites.

    A letter from Maurice Arwald in England wrote: "I am preparing to publish a new book about satellites. Originally, I intended to write about the American 'Vanguard' satellite, but now I have abandoned that idea and will write about the Soviet satellite."

    A letter from the United States said: "We hope that the satellite's flight in the sky will promote the arrival of a peaceful and united life for people all over the world."

    A French poet, Maurice Reymond, even sent a poem from Paris dedicated to the future Soviet third artificial satellite. He wrote:

    "Before long,
    You will fly over the whole world,
    So that 'glory' in the outer space beyond the clouds
    Continues its journey."

    A child no more than seven years old sent a letter from Philadelphia, USA, congratulating the Soviet Union on its satellite achievements and celebrating the New Year. He also requested in his letter that he be sent trucks and peacock feathers and other toys brought from the moon.

    A large proportion of the letters expressed a desire to participate in space travel.

    A letter from Bulgaria wrote: "I am a miner, living a good life, with no worries. I request that you accept me to participate in the next satellite flight."

    An eighteen-year-old electrical worker sent a letter from Peru saying: "I welcome and congratulate all the Soviet people. Russia, this powerful country in the world, has demonstrated spiritual and scientific achievements to the people of the world. Your achievements are the result of the Soviet Union's implementation of policies that bring economic and cultural progress. I hope to come to your country and be able to fly on a satellite going to the moon."

    A letter from Los Angeles, USA, said: "I want to buy a ticket to the moon. If the tickets are sold out, then buy a ticket to any planet." Another letter from the United States also requested to be a passenger on an interstellar spaceship, and he even agreed not to return, because he said he did not live well in the United States.

    Many letters also sent many materials and various designs and ideals about interstellar flight.

    红月亮的主人深受爱戴
    “莫斯科—卫星”联系着世界各国人民
    许多人表示愿意参加第一批星际旅行
    新华社莫斯科13日电　苏联发射人造卫星以来，“莫斯科—卫星”这个通讯处已经闻名全世界。这里每天都收到来自世界各个角落的众多工人、农民、职员、学者以及少年的来信，信中满是对苏联发射人造卫星的祝贺与希望。
    英国莫里斯·阿耳瓦德的信写道：“我正准备出版一本关于卫星的新书，原先我还打算写关于美国‘先锋’卫星呢，可是现在我已抛弃了这个念头，我要写苏联的卫星了。”
    一封来自美国的信说：“我们希望卫星在天空的飞行能促进全世界人民和平团结日子的到来。”
    法国一位诗人莫里斯·雷蒙还从巴黎寄来了一首诗，献给未来的苏联第三颗人造卫星。他写道：
    “再过不久，
    你将飞向全世界的上空，
    为了使‘光荣’在云外的空际
    继续自己的旅程。”
    一个最多不过七岁的孩子从美国费城寄来了他祝贺苏联卫星成就和祝贺新年的信。他还在信中请求寄给他从月亮上带来的卡车和孔雀羽毛等玩具。
    很大一部分信件是希望参加宇宙旅行的。
    一封来自保加利亚的信写道：“我是一个矿工，生活很好，没有任何牵挂，我请求接受我参加下一个卫星的飞行。”
    一位十八岁电气工人，从秘鲁寄来一信写道：“我欢迎和祝贺全体苏联人民。俄罗斯这个世界上强大的国家，向全世界人民证明了精神上和科学上的成就。你们的成就是苏联执行带来经济和文化进步的政策的结果。我希望能到你们国家来，并且能在向月球去的卫星上飞行。”
    一封从美国洛杉矶寄来的信说：“我要买一张到月亮去的票，如果票已卖完，那就买一张飞向任何星球的票。”另一封从美国来的信也要求作为星际飞船的乘客，他甚至同意不必回来，因为他说，他在美国生活得并不好。
    还有许多来信寄来了许多材料以及关于星际飞行的各种设计和理想。
