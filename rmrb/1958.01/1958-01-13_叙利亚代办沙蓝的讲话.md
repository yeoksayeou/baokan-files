Your Highness, Saif al-Islam Muhammad al-Badr, Crown Prince of Yemen,
Premier Zhou Enlai,
Your Excellencies Ambassadors and Chargés d'Affaires,
Ladies and Gentlemen:

	I feel extremely pleased and honored to be able to welcome His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Yemen at this reception, and in such a great friendly country that has consistently maintained a noble attitude towards all Arab countries.

	We, the Arab people, will always remember the moral and material support that the great Chinese people have given us in our struggle for unity, independence, and complete sovereignty, especially the unforgettable support that great China gave to Egypt during its heroic struggle against the tripartite aggression in October 1956.

	In addition, China firmly supported Yemen's struggle to restore its sovereignty over the so-called protectorates in the Arabian Peninsula. Here, on behalf of the Syrian people and government, I would like to proudly express my gratitude to the great Chinese people for the attitude they adopted when Syria and its independence were challenged.

	Your Highness, your visit to the People's Republic of China is a concrete manifestation of the profound friendship and respect of Arab countries for China. This visit will strengthen the friendly and cooperative ties between China and the Arab world in the spirit of the Bandung Conference and the recent Afro-Asian Conference in Cairo. We also sincerely hope that following Your Highness's visit to China, there will be many mutual friendly visits by great figures and leaders from China and various Arab countries.

	Syria believes in peaceful coexistence and its Five Principles, because Syria firmly believes in peace and friendship between all countries in the world, and never believes in war and warmongers. Although imperialism and its agents are plotting and attempting to prevent us from living in peace, preventing us from raising the living standards of our people, and preventing our people and future generations from enjoying a better life, we are convinced that with all peace-loving countries like great China as our sincere friends, we will surely be able to make imperialism and its agents suffer a complete defeat without gaining any success or benefit.

	Please allow me to propose a toast:

	To the health of His Majesty King Imam of Yemen, Chairman Mao Zedong, His Royal Highness Crown Prince Saif al-Islam Muhammad al-Badr, Premier Zhou Enlai, and all distinguished guests,
	To the unbreakable unity of the Afro-Asian people,
	To world peace,
	Cheers!

    叙利亚代办沙蓝的讲话塞弗·伊斯兰·穆罕默德·巴德尔殿下
    周恩来总理阁下各位大使、代办阁下女士们，先生们：
    我感到非常愉快和荣幸，能够在这个招待会上欢迎也门王太子殿下而且是在这样一个对所有阿拉伯国家一贯持高尚态度的伟大的友好国家里来欢迎他。
    我们阿拉伯人民将永远记得伟大的中国人民在我们争取团结、独立和完整主权的斗争中所给予我们的道义上和物质上的支援，特别是在1956年10月埃及进行英勇斗争反对三国侵略时，伟大的中国所给予埃及的难忘的支持。
    此外，中国坚决支持了也门为恢复它对阿拉伯半岛上的所谓保护国的主权的斗争。在这里我愿意代表叙利亚人民和政府骄傲地对伟大的中国人民在叙利亚及其独立遭到挑衅时所采取的态度表示感谢。
    殿下，您这次来中华人民共和国进行访问是阿拉伯各国对中国的深厚友情和尊敬的一个具体表现。这种访问将本着万隆会议和最近在开罗举行的非亚会议的精神加强中国和阿拉伯之间的友好合作联系。我们也深切希望，继殿下这次访华之后，将有中国和阿拉伯各国的旁的许多伟大人物和领导人进行相互的友好访问。
    叙利亚信奉和平共处及其五项原则，因为叙利亚完全相信世界各国之间的和平和友好，而从不相信战争和战争贩子。虽然帝国主义及其代理人进行着阴谋，企图使我们不能够安宁地生活，不让我们提高人民的生活水平，使我们的人民和后代享受更美好的生活，我们确信，有了像伟大的中国这样的所有爱好和平的国家作为我们真诚的朋友，我们一定能够使帝国主义及其代理人遭到彻底失败而得不到任何成功或者利益。
    请允许我提议：
    为也门国王伊玛姆陛下、毛泽东主席阁下、塞弗·伊斯兰·穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下、周恩来总理阁下和贵宾们的健康，
    为非亚人民牢不可破的团结，
    为世界和平，
    干杯！
