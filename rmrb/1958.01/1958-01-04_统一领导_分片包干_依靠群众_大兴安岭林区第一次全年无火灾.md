    Unified Leadership, Contract Responsibility System by Area, Relying on the Masses
    The Greater Khingan Range Forest Area Achieves its First Year Without Fires
    (Our dispatch) The Greater Khingan Range Forest Area in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, thanks to its effective fire prevention work, became a fire-free forest area for the first time in its history last year. The Greater Khingan Range is one of China's largest forest areas. Since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, protecting this forest resource has been the primary task of forestry construction, greatly reducing forest fires compared to before liberation. However, due to the vastness of the forest area, its connection to grasslands, strong winds, drought, and widespread fire sources, fires have still occurred in previous years. In the spring of 1956, there were eighteen fires, and the area of damaged forest land was equivalent to more than forty times the afforestation area of the entire region during the same period.
    The Party and government organs at all levels in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region learned from this heavy lesson and, at the beginning of last year, closely relied on the masses and mobilized them to launch a vigorous movement to eliminate forest fires. Party and government at all levels, especially in the forest area, universally implemented a responsibility system of "unified leadership, contract responsibility system by area," dividing responsibility areas from the banner and county to the township and commune, and comprehensively planning fire prevention and production work.
    In the forest fire prevention movement in various places, attention was paid to resolving the contradiction between forest fire prevention and the current production and life of the masses. In the past, this problem had not been well resolved; either the masses were completely prohibited from entering the mountains during the fire prevention period, or they were left unattended. As a result, the production of various ethnic groups relying on forest by-products was restricted, and the fire sources caused by production and life did not decrease. Last year, various places adopted organized and led approaches to allow the masses to enter the mountains to clear forest farms, prune branches, fish, hunt, and collect various forest by-products. In Butha Banner alone, the Oroqen hunters obtained more than 300 deer. The burning of over 600,000 hectares of accumulated pastureland with germs and infectious diseases was approved for the herdsmen of twelve banners, which is expected to increase the production of new and tender pasture by more than 40 million poods (one pood equals 32 jin), which can solve the grazing needs of 1.2 million livestock during summer and winter. This not only increased the income of the masses and satisfied them, but also made them realize the great significance of forest fire prevention from their actual interests. With the development of the socialist education movement in rural areas and forest areas, the masses' awareness of loving and protecting forests was further enhanced. Now, every family has established a fire prevention agreement, and every household is equipped with fire prevention tools. The slogan "Forest fire prevention is the responsibility of everyone" has become the conscious action of the broad masses.
    In last year's forest fire prevention work, professional organizations also played an active role. In the vast Greater Khingan Range Forest Area, nineteen forest management bureaus and ninety-seven forest management offices were established and improved, and thousands of foresters and semi-detached-from-production hunter-foresters were equipped to engage in mountain and road patrol activities. Under the unified leadership of the local Party and government, these forestry institutions all regarded forest fire prevention as the primary task to be implemented. In the deep mountains and dense forests where people rarely set foot, six chemical fire extinguishing teams, twelve fire risk forecasting stations, and twenty-five radio telephone stations were also established. These ground communications and patrols, closely coordinated with aerial patrols, played a huge role in timely detection of fires and timely command of extinguishing mountain fires. Last spring, natural fires (lightning fires) occurred many times in the virgin forest, but they were all extinguished in a timely manner. Therefore, mountain fires were completely overcome last year, and an unprecedented fire-free forest area appeared.

### 统一领导  分片包干  依靠群众  大兴安岭林区第一次全年无火灾

    统一领导  分片包干  依靠群众
    大兴安岭林区第一次全年无火灾
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区大兴安岭林区，由于做好了防火工作，去年成为历史上第一次无森林火灾区。大兴安岭是我国最大的林区之一。内蒙古自治区成立以来，一直把保护好这片森林资源作为林业建设的首要任务，使森林火灾比解放以前大为减少。但由于林区辽阔，具有连接草原，风大、干旱、火源广泛等特点，历年仍有火灾发生。1956年春季即曾发生了十八次火灾，被损害的林地面积就相当于同一时期全区造林面积的四十多倍。
    内蒙古自治区各级党、政机关接受了这一沉重教训，去年一开头就密切依靠群众、发动群众大张旗鼓地开展了无森林火灾运动。各级党政特别是林区普遍实行“统一领导，分片包干”的责任制度，由旗、县到乡、社，都划分出责任区，全面规划防火与生产工作。
    各地护林防火运动中，都注意解决了护林防火与群众当前生产生活矛盾问题。过去这个问题一直没有很好解决，不是防火期一律禁止群众入山，便是放任不管。其结果使许多依靠森林副产品的各族人民的生产受到限制，而生产生活所引起的火源并未因此减少。去年各地采取有组织有领导地让群众入山清理林场、修间枝柴、打鱼、狩猎和采集各种森林副产品。仅布特哈旗境内的鄂伦春族猎民获取的鹿，就有三百多头，批准十二个旗的牧民燃烧陈积带有病菌传染的牧场六十余万公顷，预计能增产新嫩牧草四千多万普特（每普特合三十二市斤），能解决一百二十万头牲畜过夏过冬的放牧需要。这样，不仅增加了群众的收入，做到群众满意，并使群众从实际利益上认识到护林防火的重大意义。随着农村、林区社会主义教育运动的开展，进一步提高了群众爱国护林的觉悟。现在是家家订立防火公约，户户备有防火工具，“护林防火，人人有责”的口号，已经成为广大群众的自觉行动。
    在去年的护林防火工作中，专业机构也发挥了积极作用。在广阔的大兴安岭林区，建立与健全了十九个森林经营局和九十七个森林经营所，并配备成千的营林员和半脱离生产的猎民护林员，从事巡山巡道活动。这些营林机构在当地党政统一领导下，都把护林防火列为首要任务来贯彻执行。在人迹罕到的深山密林里，还建立化学灭火队六处，火险预报站十二处，无线电话报机二十五台。这些地面通讯、巡护紧紧地与天空航护配合，对于及时发现火情，及时指挥扑打山火，起到了巨大效果。去年春季在原始林内多次发生自然火（雷击火），都被及时扑灭。因此，去年就彻底战胜了山林火灾，出现了史无前例的无森林火灾区。
