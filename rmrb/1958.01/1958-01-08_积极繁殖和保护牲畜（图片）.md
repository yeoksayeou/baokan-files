Actively Breed and Protect Livestock

	The Chunxiao Agricultural Cooperative in Chiping County, Shandong Province, attaches great importance to the breeding of draught animals and the protection of young animals. In the past two years, a total of 172 young animals were born from 145 female animals in the cooperative, with 168 surviving. The cooperative holds three livestock appraisal meetings each year during the slack farming seasons of spring, summer, and winter. Through appraisal and commendation of advanced individuals, the enthusiasm and responsibility of the breeders are inspired and enhanced. This is the winter livestock appraisal meeting currently underway. Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Zhiping photo
