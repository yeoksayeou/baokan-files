The Taiyuan Leather Factory's Method of Utilizing Waste Materials is Good

(Reported by this newspaper) Since the beginning of last year, the Taiyuan Leather Factory has used waste materials to produce many inexpensive and good-quality leather products.

In the past, large amounts of small pieces of leather and lining leather accumulated everywhere in the workshop. Some of these were cut off during the production of products, and some were shaved off the leather sheets. The factory dumped piles of lining leather as garbage and sold bundles of small pieces of leather to shoemakers for a little over two jiao per jin.

In accordance with the call of the Party Central Committee to run enterprises diligently and thriftily, veteran worker Peng Anyuan, together with Yin Zengyuan, repeatedly studied and proposed the suggestion of cutting small pieces of leather into various patterns, piecing them together, and making women's handbags. This suggestion was immediately supported by the workers in the factory. They used lining leather to make small wallets and hat brims. They also used small pieces of leather to make beautiful belts with interlocking rings. In this single item alone, workers saved more than 700 cowhides for the country in nine months.

    太原皮革厂利用废料的办法好
    本报讯　太原皮革厂从去年年初以来利用废料作了许多价廉物美的皮革产品。
    从前，车间里四处堆积着大量的小块皮子和里皮，这些东西，有的是制作产品时剪裁下来的，有的是从皮张上刨下来的。厂里把成堆的里皮当垃圾倒掉了，把大捆小篓的小块皮子按每斤两角多钱卖给了鞋匠们。
    根据党中央提出的勤俭办企业的号召，老工人彭安元同殷增元一起反复研究，提出了把小块皮子剪成各种图案拼到一处做女用手提包的建议，立即得到厂里工人的响应。他们用里皮制作小钱包、帽口。还用小块皮子作成了一环扣一环的美观的皮带。仅这一项，工人们在九个月内，就为国家节约了七百多张牛皮。
