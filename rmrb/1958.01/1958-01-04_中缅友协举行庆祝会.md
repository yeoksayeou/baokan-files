Xinhua News Agency, 3rd January: The Sino-Burmese Friendship Association held a celebration on the evening of January 3rd to mark the tenth anniversary of the independence of the Union of Burma on January 4th.

Zheng Zhenduo, President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, spoke at the celebration, extending warm congratulations on behalf of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association. He said: Over the past ten years since the founding of the Union of Burma, the Burmese government and people have made many achievements in developing the country's economy and culture. In international affairs, it has pursued a policy of peace and neutrality, playing an increasingly important role in the struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world, and has consistently supported the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. This just stance is welcomed by the broad masses of peace-loving people of all countries. As one of the initiators of the Asian-African Conference, the Burmese government and people are working to implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference and strengthen the friendship between Asian and African countries.

Zheng Zhenduo said that the friendly relations between China and Burma are growing day by day. Taking the past year as an example, through contacts between leaders of the two governments and mutual visits by various delegations, Sino-Burmese friendly relations have taken a step forward on the original basis.

In his report, he introduced the development of the Union of Burma's economic and cultural undertakings and its current achievements, as well as the situation of democracy and unity since Burma's independence. He concluded by saying: We believe that if all countries can live together in peace, the world situation will be greatly improved. Let us strictly abide by and resolutely implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Let us consolidate Sino-Burmese friendship after creating the Five Principles and make outstanding contributions to peace in Asia and the world.

Lin Lixuan, Secretary-General of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, read out a congratulatory telegram from President Zheng Zhenduo to Dr. Htin Baw, Chairman of the Burma-China Friendship Association.
