    This newspaper reports that Beijing's joint state-private Tongyi Water Pump Factory, with the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, is tapping into the enterprise's potential. Without increasing personnel, expanding factory buildings, or adding equipment, it has determined that this year's planned output (number of units) will exceed the 1957 production performance (number of units) by 133%.

    The Tongyi Water Pump Factory is one of the eleven factories in the country that specialize in making water pumps, as determined at the National Agricultural Conference. With the rapid development of rural water conservancy, various places need a large number of irrigation and drainage equipment. This year, the state has assigned the factory the task of producing 4,000 water pumps annually, which is 2,289 more than in 1957. This factory is located in a small alley, with only more than 230 employees, more than 30 machine tools, and 1,320 square meters of operating area. Suddenly, this year's output is to be increased by more than double, and there are many difficulties. When the enterprise's administrative leaders arranged this year's production plan in December last year, they submitted a list to the higher authorities, requesting the addition of 116 people, 11 precision machine tools, and the construction of a large workshop capable of accommodating 100 people, etc.

    Can the task of 4,000 units be completed with the existing manpower and equipment?

    When the party branch secretary raised this question to the factory director and department heads, the factory director advocated revising the 1958 production plan to be only 15% higher than the 1957 plan. The party branch discussed this plan and felt that it was too far from the state's requirements. The branch committee believed that it was necessary to understand the enterprise's situation and find out the enterprise's potential in order to formulate an advanced plan.

    While investigating the enterprise's potential, the administration made two more revisions to the plan. In addition to slightly reducing the requests for personnel and equipment, the planned growth rate increased from 15% to 23.7%. According to this plan, machines and personnel still need to be added. The enterprise's administrative personnel said: The great development of agriculture means the great development of our factory; we should not only consider the present, but also see the future; asking for machines and personnel is to adapt to the situation of great development.

    With the help of the higher party committee, the branch organized all the factory employees to study documents related to the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. At the same time, two comrades who had just returned from the countryside reported on the urgent need for a large number of irrigation and drainage equipment in the countryside and the farmers' use of "poor methods" to build water conservancy projects. The branch then asked the employees: Can we use "poor methods" to run our factory?

    This question caused widespread discussion among the employees. The workers said one after another: Although our factory is small, there are many ways to increase production and practice economy. Some people suggested: As long as our factory improves the labor organization, implements fixed product operations, and adjusts the production line, the existing labor quotas can be shortened by an average of more than 46%, and the operating area can be greatly reduced. The original request to build a large workshop and three large canopies can now be achieved by simply building one canopy. Employees believe that there is much to be done in improving work efficiency. They cited examples: Veteran worker Zhang Yongqing designed and manufactured a grinding wheel frame. With this equipment, the work that used to take four hours can be shortened to thirty minutes. The workers who make water pump frames could only make twelve sets a day in the first half of December. In the second half of the month, female worker Li Yingqian, with the help of veteran workers, improved her operating skills and could make twenty-five sets a day. Fitter He Qingrui installed a small vertical milling frame on a small bench drill. The work that used to take five hours can now be completed in just over an hour. Currently, Zhang Yongqing is designing an automatic screw-threading tool holder, which is nearing completion. If it is successfully tested, it can change the current screw-threading process from three steps to one. A water pump requires 20 to 40 pairs of screws, and this innovation is of great significance for increasing production.

    After analyzing everyone's opinions, the party branch believed that the potential in the enterprise was great. Although it had been tapped many times in the past, and some people thought it was exhausted, it now seems that there are many hidden strengths. If the above advanced experiences are widely promoted and ideological education work is done well to expand the current team of advanced workers from 19% to 30%, and the number of workers in the middle and backward state is greatly reduced, work efficiency and equipment utilization can also be greatly improved. If people's enthusiasm is brought into play, one person can do the work of one and a half people, which is tantamount to increasing personnel and adding equipment.

    After the factory director and plan drafters carefully studied these opinions from the masses, they also said: The opinions of the masses have broken through our conservative thinking.

    Currently, this factory has fully estimated the potential strength in all aspects. On the basis of tapping potential, it has formulated a plan to complete the annual production of 4,000 water pumps without increasing personnel or adding equipment. In the first quarter of this year, it plans to complete 950 units, which is 72% higher than the same period last year. (Attached picture)

### 不添设备不添人　生产猛增一倍多  同益水泵厂经验证明：潜力是挖不完的

    不添设备不添人　生产猛增一倍多
    同益水泵厂经验证明：潜力是挖不完的
    本报讯　北京公私合营同益水泵厂以大跃进的精神挖掘企业潜力，在不增加人员、不扩建厂房、不增添设备的条件下，确定今年的计划产量（台数）超过1957年生产实绩（台数）的133％。
    同益水泵厂是全国农业会议上被确定为全国十一家专做水泵的工厂之一。随着农村水利事业的迅速发展，各地需要大量的排灌设备，今年国家交给这个厂子的任务是年产四千台水泵，比1957年多出二千二百八十九台。这个厂在一条小胡同里，只有二百三十多名职工，三十多台机床，一千三百二十平方公尺的作业面积，今年的产量突然要增加到一倍以上，困难是不少的。企业的行政领导干部在去年12月份安排今年的生产计划时，就向上级开了一张单子。要求增加一百十六个人，增添十一台精密机床，要求修建一个容纳一百人的大车间等。
    在现有人力和设备条件下，能不能完成四千台任务呢？
    当党的支部书记向厂长及科室干部提出这个问题的时候，厂长主张把1958年生产计划修改为只比1957年的计划高出15％。党支部讨论这个计划，觉得距国家要求太远。支委会认为，必须把企业的情况摸清楚，把企业的潜力找出来，才能订出先进的计划。
    在调查企业有那些潜力的时候，行政上对计划又作了两次修改，除在要人要东西方面，稍稍削减了一些以外，在计划增长率方面由15％提高到23.7％。按这个计划，机器和人员还得要增加。企业行政人员说：农业的大发展，就意味着我们厂子的大发展；我们不要只顾眼前，还要看到远景；要机器要人，就是为了适应大发展的形势。
    支部在上级党委的帮助下，组织全厂职工学习了有关多快好省建设方针的文件。同时，有两个刚从农村回来的同志报告，农村急需大量的排灌设备以及农民用穷办法兴修水利的情况。支部就向职工提出：能不能用穷办法来办我们的工厂呢？
    这个问题在职工中引起了广泛的议论。工人们纷纷表示：我们的厂子虽小，但增产节约的办法可不少。有人提出：我们厂只要改进一下劳动组织，实行固定产品作业，调整一下生产线路，就可以使现有的工时定额平均缩短到46％以上，作业面积可以大大地缩小。原来要求盖一个大车间、三个大天棚，现在只要搭一个天棚就成了。职工们认为在提高工作效率方面也大有可为。他们举例说：老工人张永清设计制成了砂轮架，用这种设备，可以使四个小时完成的活儿缩短到三十分钟。做水泵架子的工人，12月上半月每天只能做十二副，下半月女工李英倩在老工人的帮助下，改进了操作技术，一天可以做二十五个。钳工何清瑞在小台钻上装了个小立铣架子，过去五个小时的活儿，现在一个多小时就完成了。目前张永清正在设计一个车螺丝的自动刀架，已接近完成，如果试用成功的话，可以把现在旋螺丝的工序由三道改为一道。一台水泵需用二十至四十对螺丝，这项创造对提高产量是有极为重大的意义的。
    党支部在分析了大家的意见以后，认为企业里的潜力是很大的。过去虽然挖过多次，也有人认为是挖完了；现在看来，潜在力量多得很。如果普遍推广了以上的这些先进经验，充分做好思想教育工作，使目前先进工人的队伍由19％扩大到30％，中间和落后状态的工人人数大大减少的话，工作效率、设备利用率还可以大大提高。人的积极性发挥出来了，一个人顶一个半人做事，这就无异于增加了人员增添了设备。
    当厂长和计划编制人员仔细研究了这些来自群众的意见以后，他们也说：群众的意见是突破了我们的保守思想。
    目前，这个厂已经充分地估计了各方面的潜在力量，在挖潜力的基础上，订出了在不增加人员，不增添设备的前提下，完成年产四千台水泵的计划。今年第一季度准备完成九百五十台，比去年同期高出72％。（附图片）
