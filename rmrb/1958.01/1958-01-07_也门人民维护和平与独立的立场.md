The visit of Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense of Yemen, Al-Badr, to our country is a major event in the friendly exchanges between the people of China and Yemen. The friendship brought by the distinguished guests from the shores of the Red Sea makes the Chinese people feel very close; their efforts to resolutely oppose colonialism, maintain peace, and promote international cooperation have won the great respect of the Chinese people.

Although our two peoples are separated by thousands of miles, our mutual understanding is deepening. We know well that the Kingdom of Yemen is a peace-loving Arab country with a long history. Yemen has long been enslaved by foreign invaders and is still subject to aggression and attacks by Western colonialists. But the Yemeni people are a strong and brave nation. They have achieved great victories in their struggle against colonial oppression and for the maintenance of national independence.

As early as 1839, Britain forcibly occupied the Aden region in southern Yemen. In 1863 and 1882, Britain successively occupied large areas of Yemeni territory, placing them under British "protection" and calling them the "Aden Protectorate." In 1949 and 1950, Britain successively invaded and occupied Kamaran Island and the Shabwa oil-producing area in Yemeni territory. In order to achieve its aim of completely controlling Yemen, the British colonialists did not hesitate to adopt despicable subversive means and created two bloody coups. After these subversive activities were crushed by the Yemeni patriotic forces, Britain intensified its armed provocations against Yemen. After the failure of the invasion of Egypt, in order to further control the Red Sea coast, Britain openly launched a large-scale armed invasion of Yemen, barbarously bombing the peaceful residents of Yemen. In order to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland, the Yemeni people united and waged a heroic anti-British war, causing a major setback to Britain's invasion plan.

Yemeni Crown Prince Badr pointed out at a welcoming banquet in Beijing on the 1st: "Yemen will continue to work hard and will not hesitate to sacrifice all our precious things until these occupied areas return to the embrace of its great mother—Yemen." This fully expresses the firm will of the Yemeni people to safeguard national independence. The Yemeni people's struggle against British aggression has not only defended the independence of the country, but has also made beneficial contributions to Asian and world peace.

The Yemeni people, who have fought against colonialism for a long time, know that the struggle against colonialism is inseparable from the movement to defend peace. The US aggression plan implemented around the world, especially in the Asian and African regions, endangers world peace and threatens the national independence of Asian and African countries. Since the end of the war, the Yemeni people have made great efforts to oppose the imperialist policies of arms expansion and war preparations and aggressive war activities, and to strive for the relaxation of international tensions. The Yemeni government resolutely pursues a policy of peace and neutrality and opposes imperialist aggressive military blocs in Asia and Africa. In 1951, the United States pieced together an aggressive military bloc in the Middle East, attempting to drag Yemen into this bloc, but was resolutely rejected by Yemen. After the failure of the Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of Egypt, the American colonialists promoted the aggressive "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East. This neo-colonialist plan was also resolutely opposed by Yemen. Yemeni King Imam Ahmad said that on the issue of the Eisenhower Doctrine, Yemen supports the Arab view, which is: "We will be friendly to anyone who is friendly to us and hostile to anyone who is hostile to us." Last September, the King of Yemen refused to meet with a US official delegation that intended to provide aid to Yemen in accordance with the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The Yemeni Deputy Foreign Minister said, "Although Yemen is in great need of financial assistance, it refuses any plan that aims to subject Yemen to foreign forces or rule, and Yemen will not accept any assistance that undermines its independence and sovereignty." This position is entirely in line with Yemen's national interests.

The Yemeni people attach great importance to unity and cooperation with Asian and African countries, especially Arab countries. Yemen joined the Arab League as early as 1945 and has consistently strengthened political, economic and cultural cooperation with Arab countries. In order to jointly defend against imperialist aggression, Yemen signed a military agreement with Saudi Arabia on April 20, 1956, and on April 21, Yemen signed a military alliance treaty with Egypt and Saudi Arabia. According to the provisions of the alliance, Yemen and Arab countries provide mutual support in the struggle against colonialism. In 1956, the Egyptian government's just action of nationalizing the Suez Canal Company was fully supported by Yemen. Yemeni Crown Prince Badr said at the time, "Egypt can use Yemen's armed forces and resources to repel any Western aggressors." Yemen's struggle against British aggression and for the maintenance of independence and sovereignty has also been firmly supported by Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries. The Political Committee of the Arab League passed a resolution in 1957, strongly condemning British aggression and supporting Yemen's just struggle. This fraternal alliance and mutual support between Yemen and Arab countries has greatly strengthened their strength in maintaining independent sovereignty and plays an important role in defeating imperialist aggression and maintaining peace in the Middle East and the world.

Common hardships and struggles, and traditional friendship, closely link the Yemeni people with the people of Asian and African countries. In April 1955, Yemen participated in the historic Bandung Conference and contributed to the success of the conference. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, which just concluded in Cairo, has also received the support of the Yemeni people. For more than two years, the Yemeni government has consistently been faithful to the Bandung spirit and principles and has actively strengthened friendly ties with Asian and African countries.

The Yemeni people have also received the deep sympathy and support of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union in their struggle to maintain independence. From their own experience, the Yemeni people have realized that socialist countries are their loyal and reliable friends. On the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the friendly cooperation between Yemen and socialist countries has made important progress.

As early as 1928, Yemen and the Soviet Union established friendly relations. On October 31, 1955, the two countries concluded a treaty of friendship. In March 1956, Yemen and the Soviet Union signed a trade agreement. Trade relations between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit have developed. In June 1956, Crown Prince Badr visited the Soviet Union, held talks with Soviet state leaders, and issued a communique, stating that the two countries should work together for peace and strengthen friendly cooperation.

Yemen's relations with Eastern European socialist countries have also seen new developments in recent years. In 1956, after visiting the Soviet Union, Crown Prince of Yemen also visited Democratic Germany and Czechoslovakia. Before coming to China this time, Crown Prince of Yemen visited Romania, Poland, and Yugoslavia. During the visits, Yemen decided to establish diplomatic relations with these socialist countries and concluded agreements on developing trade and conducting cooperation in other areas.

China and Yemen have had exchanges since ancient times and have a long-standing friendship. During the Bandung Conference, the friendly contacts between our delegation and the Yemeni delegation laid a solid foundation for the further development of friendly relations between the two countries. In 1956, Crown Prince Badr of Yemen said: "Nothing can prevent Yemen from recognizing the People's Republic of China." Just two months later, Yemen established formal diplomatic relations with our country. This visit to our country by Crown Prince Badr is an important symbol of the further development of friendship between China and Yemen.

Crown Prince Badr has a sincere friendship with the Chinese people and a lofty desire to promote friendly relations between the two countries. He said that our two peoples should strengthen the inherent ties between the two countries through mutual visits and achieve a better mutual understanding, which will help the friendly exchanges, economic mutual benefit and cooperation in culture and art between the two peoples. The Chinese people have a warm resonance with this. Premier Zhou Enlai expressed this wish of the Chinese people: "The Chinese people cherish the friendship between the Yemeni people and the people of Arab countries very much. We will answer friendship with friendship." Let the friendly and cooperative relations between our two peoples continue to develop, and let us work together in the cause of maintaining peace, opposing aggression, and promoting international cooperation!

    也门人民维护和平与独立的立场
    鲁映
    也门王太子、副首相兼外交和国防大臣巴德尔的访问我国，是中、也两国人民友好往来中的一件大事。贵宾们远从红海之滨带来的友谊，使中国人民感到十分亲切；他们坚决反对殖民主义、维护和平、促进国际合作的努力，得到了中国人民的极大尊敬。
    我们两国人民虽远隔万里，但相互了解日深。我们熟知也门王国是一个具有悠久历史的、爱好和平的阿拉伯国家。也门曾经长期遭到外国侵略者的奴役，目前仍然受到西方殖民主义者的侵略和进攻。但也门人民是坚强勇敢的民族。他们在反对殖民压迫、维护民族独立的斗争中，取得了很大的胜利。
    远在1839年，英国便强占了也门南部的领土亚丁地区。1863和1882年，英国又相继占领了也门大片的土地，把它们置于英国的“保护”之下，称为“亚丁保护地”。1949和1950年，英国又先后侵占了也门领土卡姆兰岛和沙波尔石油产区。为了达到完全控制也门的企图，英国殖民者不惜采取了卑鄙的颠覆手段，制造了两次流血政变。在这些颠覆活动被也门爱国力量粉碎之后，英国更变本加厉地对也门进行武装挑衅。在侵埃战争失败以后，英国为了进一步控制红海沿岸，公然对也门发动了大规模的武装侵略，野蛮地轰炸也门的和平居民。也门人民为了捍卫祖国的独立自由，团结一致地进行了英勇的抗英战争，使英国的侵略计划遭受了重大的挫折。
    也门王太子巴德尔1日在北京的欢迎宴会上指出：“也门将继续努力，不惜牺牲我们的一切宝贵的东西，直到这些被占地区回到它的伟大的母亲——也门怀抱里”。这充分表达了也门人民维护民族独立的坚强意志。也门人民反对英国侵略的斗争，不仅保卫了国家的独立，而且对于亚洲和世界和平也作出了有益的贡献。
    曾同殖民主义进行过长期斗争的也门人民知道，反对殖民主义的斗争是同保卫和平运动分不开的。美国在全世界特别是在亚非地区执行的侵略计划，危害世界和平，威胁亚非国家的民族独立。战后以来，也门人民为反对帝国主义的扩军备战政策和侵略战争活动，为争取缓和国际紧张局势作了很大的努力。也门政府坚决奉行和平中立政策，反对帝国主义在亚非地区的侵略性军事集团。1951年美国在中东拼凑侵略性军事集团，企图把也门拉入这个集团，但遭到了也门的坚决拒绝。英法以侵埃战争失败后，美国殖民者在中东推行侵略性的
  “艾森豪威尔主义”。这个新殖民主义计划也遭到也门的坚决反对。也门国王伊马姆·艾哈迈德说，在对艾森豪威尔主义的问题上，也门支持阿拉伯观点，就是：“我们将对任何和我们友好的人友好，和任何对我们敌意的人为敌”。去年9月，也门国王拒绝会见打算按照“艾森豪威尔主义”向也门提供援助的美国官方代表团。也门副外交大臣说，“尽管也门很需要财政援助，但是它拒绝使也门屈服于外国势力或统治为目的的任何计划，也门不会接受任何损害它的独立和主权的援助”。这种立场是完全符合于也门的民族利益的。
    也门人民十分重视同亚非国家特别是阿拉伯国家的团结和合作。也门早在1945年便加入了阿拉伯联盟，一贯大力加强同阿拉伯国家的政治、经济和文化合作。为了共同防御帝国主义的侵略，也门在1956年4月20日和沙特阿拉伯签订了军事协定，4月21日也门又和埃及、沙特阿拉伯签订军事联盟条约。根据联盟的规定，也门和阿拉伯国家在反对殖民主义的斗争中进行相互支援。1956年，埃及政府把苏伊士运河公司收归国有的正义行动，得到了也门的全力支持。也门王太子巴德尔当时曾说，“埃及可以利用也门的武装部队和资源，来击退西方任何的侵略者”。也门反对英国侵略、维护独立和主权的斗争，也得到了埃及、叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家的坚决支持。阿拉伯联盟政治委员会在1957年作出决议，严厉谴责英国的侵略，支持也门的正义斗争。也门和阿拉伯国家间的这种兄弟般的联盟和相互支持，大大地加强了它们维护独立主权的力量，对于击败帝国主义的侵略、对于维护中东和世界和平具有重要的作用。
    共同的患难和斗争，传统的友谊，把也门人民同亚非各国人民紧密地联系起来。1955年4月，也门参加了具有历史意义的万隆会议，并为会议的成功作出了贡献。刚刚在开罗闭幕的亚非人民团结大会，也得到了也门人民的支持。两年多以来，也门政府一贯忠实于万隆精神和原则，积极地加强了同亚非国家的友好联系。
    也门人民在维护独立的斗争中，也得到了以苏联为首的社会主义国家的深切同情和支持。也门人民从亲身的体验中，已经认识到社会主义国家是自己忠实可靠的朋友。在和平共处五项原则的基础上，也门同社会主义国家的友好合作有了重要的发展。
    早在1928年，也门和苏联就建立了友好关系。1955年10月31日，两国订立了友好条约。1956年3月，也门和苏联签订了贸易协定。两国之间在平等互利的基础上的贸易关系，有了发展。1956年6月，巴德尔王太子访问了苏联，曾与苏联国家领导人进行会谈，并发表公报，表示两国要为和平和加强友好合作而共同努力。
    也门和东欧社会主义国家的关系，近年来也有了新的发展。1956年，也门王太子访问苏联之后，又访问了民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克。也门王太子这次来中国访问之前，曾访问过罗马尼亚、波兰和南斯拉夫。在访问期间，也门同这些社会主义国家决定建立外交关系，并缔结了有关发展贸易和在其他方面进行合作的协定。
    中、也两国在历史上很早就有了往来，存在着悠久的友谊。在万隆会议期间，我国代表团同也门代表团进行的友好接触，为两国友好关系进一步发展奠定了巩固的基础。1956年也门王太子巴德尔说：“没有什么事情能够阻止也门承认中华人民共和国”。就在两个月之后，也门同我国建立了正式的外交关系。这次巴德尔王太子来我国访问，是中也两国友谊进一步发展的重要标志。
    巴德尔王太子对中国人民有着真挚的友谊和促进两国友好关系的崇高愿望。他表示我们两国人民要通过互相访问，加强两国固有的联系，达成更良好的互相了解，这样会有助于两国人民的友好往来、经济互利以及文化艺术方面的合作。中国人民对此有着热烈的共鸣。周恩来总理表达了中国人民的这个愿望：“中国人民十分珍惜也门人民和阿拉伯各国人民的友谊，我们将以友谊回答友谊。”让我们两国人民的友好合作关系不断发展，在维护和平、反对侵略、增进国际合作的事业中携手前进！
