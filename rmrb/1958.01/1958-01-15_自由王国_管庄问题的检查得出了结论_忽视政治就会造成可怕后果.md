Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Yan Wu reports: The exposure of the "Kingdom of Freedom" Guan Zhuang problem is a significant event that has emerged from the rectification movement within central state organs. Why did Guan Zhuang experience prolonged and severe chaos? What important lessons should be drawn from this? These are the questions that the work group dispatched to Guan Zhuang by the State Council and the leaders of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry have recently been focusing on.

The emergence of the chaotic situation of the "Kingdom of Freedom" in Guan Zhuang is not accidental. The problems exposed in Guan Zhuang vividly demonstrate that if the economic departments of the state focus solely on technology, burying themselves in economic affairs, and neglect the leadership of political ideology, then capitalist ideas will run rampant, leading to terrible consequences.

The State Council work group believes that it is worth noting that the situation in Guan Zhuang is not isolated. The tendency of some economic and technical departments to neglect politics has been growing in recent years. This situation deserves serious attention in the current rectification movement.

Guan Zhuang is located in Tong County, Hebei Province, just east of Beijing. It is home to nine units of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry and one unit of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, with a total of over 10,000 employees and their families. After the chaotic situation in Guan Zhuang was exposed in the "People's Daily," the State Council attached great importance to the problem. On December 11, 1957, it dispatched a five-person work group to Guan Zhuang to assist the local Party and government leading organs and the Party organizations of the organs stationed in Guan Zhuang in mobilizing the masses, deeply carrying out the rectification movement, and eliminating the chaotic phenomenon of the "Kingdom of Freedom."

According to the revelations of the masses and the investigation by the five-person work group of the State Council, the influence of bourgeois corrupt ideas, moral decay, and illegal and undisciplined behavior within the Guan Zhuang units had reached an extremely serious level. A potential force for undermining socialism had grown there. Some bad elements became increasingly bold, even defying law and order. For example, in the past year, there were 259 reported theft cases. At its worst, there were almost two or three theft cases a day. In the Cement Industry Design Institute, there was a habitual thief named Qian Dexian, who actually stole in broad daylight, carrying a large leather suitcase containing more than 30 pieces of clothing out of the Guan Zhuang gate in a brazen manner. One habitual thief had been stealing coal and firewood since 1954. For several years, he had never bought coal or firewood, and even resold it to others. As for hooligan activities, they had reached an intolerable degree. Some hooligans openly insulted women in public places and engaged in disruptive activities. The masses also revealed the rampant spread of bourgeois corrupt ideas in Guan Zhuang on big-character posters. The posters said that a social atmosphere of strengthening "basic construction" was prevalent in Guan Zhuang. The so-called "basic construction" included wristwatches, leather shoes, and woolen clothing. Some people did not care about the country's construction undertakings, did not talk about politics or work, and took eating, drinking, and enjoyment as glory.

The exposure of these chaotic phenomena opened the door to the Guan Zhuang problem. People discovered that these situations were directly related to the bureaucratic style of leadership and serious neglect of political and ideological work by the Ministry of Building Materials Industry. The leaders of the ministry blindly set up a large number of stalls in Guan Zhuang. When recruiting personnel, they did not conduct strict political reviews, allowing a small number of bad elements and counter-revolutionaries to find a hiding place, resulting in serious impurity within the organs. Some technicians were morally corrupt, some had unclear political backgrounds, and some were counterfeit engineers with fabricated histories. These people were irresponsible for the country's construction undertakings, causing serious losses and waste in their work. For example, one engineer, when conducting research, damaged ten valuable instruments worth a total of about 2,000 yuan because he did not cherish state property. Some irresponsibly lost samples that others had painstakingly tested for a year. In the Building Materials Industry Research Institute, a technician named Wang Chaojie used various deceptive methods to obtain certificates for convalescence in order to escape work. Since 1953, he had been receiving his salary as usual while "convalescing" for more than three years. During his convalescence, Wang Chaojie was full of energy, either playing ball or playing mahjong, living a leisurely life. Under such circumstances, he even viciously cursed the leaders during the rectification movement.

The leaders of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry displayed serious right-leaning tendencies when dealing with these many serious situations, and the handling of many problems also contained major errors of principle. For example, Ye Peihong, a technician at the Cement Research Institute, had long relied on the Wang Jingwei puppet regime before liberation and had participated in Kuomintang secret service peripheral organizations. After liberation, he concealed his history and participated in work, forged engineer certificates, and attempted to fraudulently obtain higher positions. From 1951 to 1954, he not only achieved nothing in his work, but also caused a lot of losses to the country. At the same time, he was consistently of a hooligan nature. In 1953, he squandered more than 1,000 yuan visiting prostitutes in Shenyang.

The Party organization of the institute had repeatedly requested the ministry to approve his expulsion based on the demands of the masses, but the leaders of the ministry always said that he did not meet the conditions for expulsion and refused to deal with him. Another example is Guan Wenxiu (a Party member), a bad element in the Cement Design Institute. He often climbed through windows into the cafeteria at midnight to steal things. Once, he was discovered and reported by a cook, and Guan Wenxiu harbored resentment against the cook. On the evening of the "May Day" holiday in 1957, he used a pistol issued to him by the security section for guard duty to break into the cafeteria in the middle of the night, loaded the pistol, threatened the cook to go downstairs, and then seriously injured him. For such a serious lawless and undisciplined element, the institute only announced his expulsion without handing him over to the judicial organs. However, the General Office of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry disagreed with such a lenient handling and insisted that the institute revoke its original decision and allow Guan Wenxiu to return to work. After Guan Wenxiu returned to the institute, he continued to steal, creating a very bad influence among the masses. The ministry's extremely wrong attitude of leniency towards bad elements actually contributed to the development of chaotic phenomena.

Due to the tendency of seriously neglecting politics, the political atmosphere in Guan Zhuang was extremely thin. The leaders of many units did not care about the work of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade unions. They regarded political and ideological education as dispensable, and even considered it a "burden" that hindered the development of business work. In Guan Zhuang, the thinking of some Party members declined, and the combat effectiveness of the Party was weakened. Some Party members complained that they were less "free" than the masses after joining the Party; some Party members said, "How much money you pay, how much work you do"; some Party members failed to pay their Party dues for five months without reason; and some even refused to fight against right-wing elements in the anti-rightist struggle, demanding "peaceful coexistence." A big-character poster titled "Strange Secrecy" revealed that the personnel department of the Installation Company had truly implemented "peaceful coexistence" with a thief. It turned out that Cao Yunfeng, a female cadre in this company, stole a blanket from a department store in Beijing. She was caught by the company and sent back to Guan Zhuang, asking the leaders of Guan Zhuang to deal with her seriously. However, Cao Yunfeng not only failed to seriously examine herself after returning, but also asked the leaders to keep her scandal a secret. The personnel department of the company actually adopted a conniving attitude and really kept the secret for her. As for the cadre policy, the erroneous idea of ​​"being specialized but not red" was once legally popular in some units in Guan Zhuang. Ding Shihou, deputy director of the Building Materials Industry Design Institute, only proposed to evaluate grades based on the level of technical proficiency and abolished political conditions during the grading in 1956. This made some young technicians mistakenly believe: "In the future, if you have technology, you will have a future." Wang Jianyun, a young technician in the Cement Industry Design Institute, had always only cared about technology and did not ask about politics. He voluntarily withdrew from the Communist Youth League when he was studying at the Northeast Institute of Technology in 1954. However, after coming to the institute, the leaders promoted him three grades in one year in 1956, and also rated him as an "advanced producer of the first rank." Some technicians in this institute also envied him, treating him as their "goal" of hard work, forming the so-called "Wang Jianyun direction."

Under this tendency to relax Party leadership and neglect politics, the departmentalism of each unit in Guan Zhuang developed, making it impossible to carry out many things in a unified manner. For example, it was impossible to implement an overall construction plan in Guan Zhuang. Everyone wanted to build their own buildings in the best location, resulting in an anarchic state of construction throughout Guan Zhuang. According to a survey, there are a total of seven boilers in the units living in Guan Zhuang. The underground heating pipes were not planned in a unified manner, and no one was willing to be responsible for repairs. Due to disrepair of the pipes, 40% of the heating was lost underground. Due to the decentralization caused by departmentalism, a great waste of manpower and material resources was created. For example, there are as many as 350 administrative staff and cadres of the Party, the Communist Youth League, trade unions, and spare-time schools in the four institutes living in Guan Zhuang. If they were unified, no more than 130 people would be enough. At the beginning of 1957, when the Cement Industry Research Institute and the Building Materials Industry Research Institute were divided, due to the departmentalism of the Cement Industry Research Institute in the distribution of goods and instruments, all three universal pressure testers were left in their own institute. According to the needs of the work, they should have distributed one to the Building Materials Industry Research Institute. As a result, the Building Materials Industry Research Institute had to spend another 70,000 yuan in foreign exchange to order from abroad, and it has not yet been purchased, which has affected the work. In particular, there is also such a strange thing in Guan Zhuang that any unit can arbitrarily overturn a common decision. Individual units often overturn collective resolutions in the construction and management of some public utilities.

The result of neglecting political and ideological leadership has also caused the organs in Guan Zhuang to be seriously divorced from the masses, damaging relations with nearby farmers. Some people arbitrarily trampled on farmers' crops, stole farmers' corn and cotton bolls, and destroyed the local Hui people's customs. In particular, the leaders of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry did not take care of the interests of the local masses, and excessively occupied farmers' land. They occupied 520,000 square meters of land in Guan Zhuang, while the building area was only 120,000 square meters. The building gaps were large, wasting a lot of land, and they were all good fields, which the farmers were very dissatisfied with.

The bureaucracy of the leaders of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry is the root cause of the chaotic phenomena in Guan Zhuang. Some people use Guan Zhuang as a metaphor, saying, "Many lice don't itch, many debts don't worry." There are so many problems in Guan Zhuang, but the leading organs can turn a blind eye and remain calm. Some problems have been discovered, but the leaders procrastinate and lack the revolutionary spirit to improve their work. The heads of many units in Guan Zhuang revealed that the leaders of the ministry have rarely gone to Guan Zhuang for a long time to seriously study and solve problems, and often only generally require the units in Guan Zhuang to "arrange their work according to their own characteristics." They often reported the problems of Guan Zhuang to the ministry, but the responsible persons of the ministry always blamed them, saying: "Your departmentalism is at work, and the problems of Guan Zhuang will be solved if you overcome departmentalism." Or criticize them, saying: "The farmers have all been cooperativized, why can't you organize?" But how to overcome departmentalism and how to thoroughly improve work, the ministers have never gone to Guan Zhuang to conduct serious inspections and handling.

Now, the leaders of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry have paid attention to the Guan Zhuang problem and have made serious self-criticisms, believing that the Guan Zhuang problem is a total exposure of the shortcomings and errors of the ministry's leadership. At the same time, the leaders of each unit in Guan Zhuang have also begun to conduct self-examinations and have launched mass criticism, gradually achieving a unified understanding of ideology. With the help of the State Council work group, the Party organizations of the Guan Zhuang units are vigorously mobilizing the masses and earnestly carrying out an in-depth rectification movement to fight for the complete elimination of the chaotic phenomena of the "Kingdom of Freedom."

    “自由王国”管庄问题的检查得出了结论
    忽视政治就会造成可怕后果
    新华社14日讯　新华社记者阎吾报道：“自由王国”管庄问题被揭露出来，是中央国家机关在整风运动中出现的一件有重要意义的事情。管庄为什么长期存在严重的混乱状况？应该从中得出什么重要的经验教训？这是国务院派到管庄的工作组同建筑材料工业部的领导人最近集中研究的问题。
    管庄出现“自由王国”的混乱状况不是偶然的。管庄所暴露出来的问题生动地证明了：国家的经济部门在领导工作中，如果仅仅抓技术，钻在经济事务的圈子里，而忽视了政治思想的领导，那就会发生资本主义思想泛滥，造成可怕的后果。
    国务院工作组认为，值得注意的是，像管庄的情况并不是个别的，一些经济技术部门忽视政治的倾向，近年来有所滋长，这种情况是当前整风运动中值得严重注意的问题。
    管庄处在北京正东的河北省通县境内，住在管庄的有建筑材料工业部九个单位和冶金工业部一个单位，共有职工和家属一万多人。管庄的混乱状况在“人民日报”上揭发以后，国务院非常重视这个问题，特地在1957年12月11日派出五人工作组到管庄，协助当地党政领导机关和住管庄机关的党组织，发动群众，深入开展整风运动，消除“自由王国”的混乱现象。
    根据群众的揭发和国务院五人工作组的调查，在管庄单位内资产阶级腐化思想的影响和道德败坏、违法乱纪的事情，达到了十分严重的地步，在那里滋长了一股破坏社会主义的潜在势力，一些坏分子愈闹胆子愈大，甚至无法无天。例如，一年来仅告发的偷窃案件就有二百五十九起，严重的时候几乎一天有二、三起偷窃案件发生。在水泥工业设计院曾有个惯窃分子钱德贤，竟然白天行窃，把偷来的一个装了三十多件衣服的大皮箱大模大样地搬出管庄大门。有一个惯窃分子从1954年就偷窃煤、柴，几年来他不但从未买过煤、柴，而且还向别人转卖。至于流氓活动，更达到了令人不能容忍的程度，有的流氓分子公然在公共场所侮辱妇女，进行捣乱活动。群众还在大字报上揭露了管庄资产阶级腐化思想的泛滥情况。大字报说，管庄流行着加强“基本建设”的社会风气，所谓“基本建设”，包括手表、皮鞋和毛料服装等。有的人不关心国家建设事业，不谈政治和工作，而以吃穿享乐为光荣。
    对这些混乱现象的揭发，敲开了管庄问题的大门，人们从中发现，这些情况是同建筑材料工业部领导上的官僚主义、严重地忽视政治思想工作有着直接的关系。部的领导上在管庄盲目地大量摆设摊子，他们在招收人员时，没有进行严格的政治审查，使少数坏分子和反革命分子找到了藏身之所，造成了机关内部的严重不纯。有的技术员道德败坏，有的政治面目不清，有的是伪造历史的冒牌工程师，这些人对于国家的建设事业不负责任，在工作中造成严重的损失和浪费。例如有一个工程师在进行研究时，由于不爱护国家财产，竟损坏了十件价值总计约二千多元的贵重仪器。有的将别人煞费苦心试验了一年的样品，不负责任地把它丢失了。在建筑材料工业研究院有个技术员王超杰，为了逃避工作，用了各种欺骗办法骗取了休养的证明文件，从1953年以来，他照常领取薪金而“休养”了三年多，在休养期间，王超杰精神十足，不是打球，就是打麻将，过着悠闲的生活。在这种情况下，他在整风运动中还恶毒地谩骂领导人。
    对于这许多严重的情况，建筑材料工业部领导上在处理时，表现了严重的右倾情绪，有许多问题的处理还犯有重大的原则性的错误。例如水泥研究院有个技术员叶培宏，解放前长期投靠汪伪组织，并参加过国民党特务外围组织，解放后他隐瞒了历史参加工作，伪造工程师证件，企图骗取较高的职务，从1951年到1954年不仅工作毫无成就，并且给国家造成了很多损失；同时他一贯流氓成性，1953年在沈阳逛暗娼就挥霍了一千多元。
    这个院的党组织曾经根据群众的要求，多次要求部里批准开除他，但是部的领导上却始终说他不够开除条件，而不予以处理。又如水泥设计院有个坏分子关文秀（党员），他经常在半夜里爬窗到食堂里偷东西，有一次被炊事员发现而告发，关文秀便对这位炊事员怀恨在心。1957年“五一”节晚上，他利用保卫科发给他的一支担任警卫工作的手枪，半夜闯进食堂，把手枪的子弹推上膛，威胁着这位炊事员下楼，然后把他打成重伤。对于这样一个严重违法乱纪的分子，院里只是宣布把他开除，而没有交由司法机关处理，可是建筑材料工业部办公厅对于这样轻微的处理也不同意，硬要院里收回原决定，允许关文秀回院工作。关文秀回院后，还不断地进行偷窃，在群众中造成极坏的影响。部里对坏分子采取这种极端错误的宽纵态度，这就在实际上助长了混乱现象的发展。
    由于严重忽视政治的倾向，使管庄的政治空气极为稀薄，许多单位的领导上不关心党、团、工会工作，他们把政治思想教育看成是可有可无，甚至认为这是妨碍业务工作开展的“累赘”。在管庄，一部分党员思想衰退，党的战斗力被削弱了。有的党员抱怨自己入党以后反而不如群众“自由”；有的党员说：“给多少钱干多少活”；有的五个月无故不缴党费；有的更在反右派斗争中拒绝同右派分子进行斗争，而要求“和平共处”。在一张题为“奇怪的保密”的大字报上，揭露了安装公司的人事部门真的同盗窃分子实行了“和平共处”。原来这个公司的女干部曹云凤，在北京市一家百货公司偷了一条毡子，被公司里抓到，将她送回管庄，要求管庄领导上严肃处理。可是曹云凤回来不但不认真检讨，反而要求领导上为她的丑事保密，公司的人事部门居然也就采取纵容的态度，真的为她保守了秘密。至于在干部政策上，管庄一些单位一度合法地流行着“光专不红”的错误思想。建筑材料工业设计院副院长丁士厚在1956年评级时，只提出以技术水平高低来评定等级，取消了政治条件。这样就使一些青年技术人员错误地认为：“今后有了技术，就有前途”。在水泥工业设计院有个青年技术人员王剑云，一贯地只管技术不问政治，在1954年东北工业学院学习时就自动退了团。可是在来院以后，领导上在1956年一年中就给他连提了三级，并且还评定他为“头等先进生产者”。这个院有些技术人员也就羡慕他，把他当作自己努力的“目标”，形成了所谓“王剑云方向”。
    在这种放松党的领导、忽视政治的倾向下，管庄各单位各自为政的本位主义发展起来，使许多事情无法统一进行。例如，在管庄无法执行一个总体建设规划，谁都要把自己的楼房修建在最好的地点，造成整个管庄建筑上的无政府状态。据调查，住在管庄的单位共有七个锅炉，地下暖气管道没有统一规划，而且都不愿意负责修理，由于管道失修，有40％的暖气在地下漏掉了。由于各自为政的分散主义，造成人力、物力的很大浪费。例如住在管庄四个院的行政事务人员和党、团、工会、业余学校干部竟有三百五十多人，如果统一起来，最多不超过一百三十人就够了。在1957年年初，水泥工业研究院和建筑材料工业研究院分院时，由于水泥工业研究院在分配物品、仪器上的本位主义，把三台万能耐压机全留在自己院里，而按工作的需要，他们应该分给建筑材料工业研究院一台，结果使得建筑材料工业研究院不得不再花七万元的外汇到国外去订购，而且到现在还没有买来而影响了工作。特别在管庄还存在着这样的怪事，任何一个单位都可以任意推翻共同的决定。在一些公共事业的建设和管理工作上，经常有个别单位推翻集体决议的事情。
    忽视政治思想领导的结果，也使管庄的机关严重地脱离了群众，损害了同附近农民的关系。有的人随意践踏农民的庄稼，偷摘农民的玉米和棉桃，并且破坏当地回民的风俗习惯。特别是建筑材料工业部领导上没有照顾当地群众的利益，过多地占用了农民的土地，他们在管庄占地五十二万平方公尺，而建筑面积只有十二万平方公尺，建筑空隙大，浪费很多土地，而且都是良田，农民很不满意。
    建筑材料工业部领导上的官僚主义，是造成管庄混乱现象的根本原因。有人以管庄作比喻说，“虱多不痒，债多不愁”，管庄问题这样多，而领导机关可以熟视无睹，处之泰然。有些问题是发现了，但是领导上拖拖拉拉，缺乏革命的精神来改进工作。管庄许多单位的负责人揭露，部的领导上长期以来很少深入管庄来认真研究解决问题，常常是笼统地要求管庄各单位“按照自己的特点”来布置工作。他们经常向部里反映管庄的问题，可是部里负责人总是责备他们说：“就是你们的本位主义在作怪，把本位主义克服了，管庄的问题就解决了。”或者批评他们说：“农民都合作化了，你们为什么不能组织起来？”但是究竟怎样克服本位主义，怎样彻底改进工作，部长们从来没有深入管庄作认真的检查和处理。
    现在，建筑材料工业部的领导人已经重视了管庄的问题，并且作了认真的检讨，认为管庄问题是部领导上的缺点和错误的总暴露。同时，管庄各单位的领导人也开始进行了检查，并且展开了群众性的批评，逐步达到了思想认识的统一。在国务院工作组的帮助下，管庄单位的党组织正大力发动群众，认真地开展深入的整风运动，为彻底消灭“自由王国”的混乱现象而斗争。
