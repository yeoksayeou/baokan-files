    Relying on the Masses, Managing Water Conservatively
    Tangya Township's Masses Self-Manage Small-Scale Water Conservancy, Saving Money and Achieving Great Results

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Zhejiang Daily, the winter water conservancy campaign in Tangya Township, Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, has fully relied on and utilized the wisdom, manpower, and financial resources of the masses, truly achieving the requirements of "more, faster, better, and more economical."

    In order to make the water conservancy construction movement a mass movement, Tangya Township corrected the past practice of having a few cadres handle water conservancy planning. The cadres first submitted their preliminary opinions on water conservancy planning to the township's water conservancy representative meeting for review and modification. Then, they adopted a method of mobilizing, planning, and acting simultaneously, constantly studying and revising with the masses in practice. Because water conservancy planning was carried out through the masses, the targets for water conservancy construction became larger and larger, specifically embodying the principle of relying on the masses' own strength to focus on the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects, which saves money and achieves great results. Of the 157 projects completed by the end of last year in the township, the masses contributed more than 84,000 workdays and raised more than 2,720 yuan. The quality of the projects built was good and the cost was low. Among them, the three reservoirs and 58 mountain ponds that were built can irrigate 4,800 mu of farmland, costing only 850 yuan in project expenses, averaging only 1 jiao and 8 fen per mu in cash. For example, the originally planned Zhaikouting Reservoir was only intended to irrigate 2,000 mu of farmland but required 130,000 workdays and 12,000 yuan, averaging more than 60 workdays and 6 yuan per mu of farmland, and would also flood more than 400 mu of farmland. After mobilizing the masses for research, the reservoir was not built. Instead, four new mountain ponds were built in the irrigation area, and the Wuqutang Reservoir was raised by 1.5 meters. This increased the benefited farmland by 530 mu compared to building the Zhaikouting Reservoir, and the cost required was only 22,800 workdays and 1,000 yuan, averaging only 9 workdays per mu, a reduction of 85% compared to the original plan. The average cost per mu was only 1 jiao and 4 fen, a reduction of 98% compared to the original plan.

    The peasant masses of Tangya Township, in revising the water conservancy plan, put forward the resounding slogan of "every ridge should have a pond, every stream should have a ditch, and every field should have a reservoir." They arranged the location, scale, and form of water conservancy projects to be more in line with reality. For example, of the originally planned nine reservoirs, five were not built, and nine more cost-effective reservoirs and 423 pond and ditch projects were added. After the plan is completed, more than 17,500 mu of farmland can benefit, and 75% of the township's farmland can be free from ordinary droughts.

    In the winter water conservancy campaign, Tangya Township also implemented the principle of reasonable burden. For projects that benefit several cooperatives, burdens are distributed to the cooperatives according to the amount of benefited farmland and the degree of benefit; within the cooperative, civilian laborers are shared according to labor points, and if the cooperative's public accumulation fund cannot cover the funds required for water conservancy construction, the shortfall is also shared by cooperative members according to labor points; piece-rate wages are implemented during construction. Because the policy of "relying on the masses and managing water conservatively" was implemented, the enthusiasm of the masses was further stimulated, and many mass-based innovations emerged. For example, old stone blocks and old bricks are generally used to build the opening and closing water release equipment for mountain pond projects; earth baskets are woven and used by themselves, and a large number of old lime baskets are used to carry earth; in previous years, it was necessary to hire ramming workers from Pujiang to build water conservancy projects. This year, methods such as mutual teaching and learning, and masters teaching apprentices were adopted. A total of 950 ramming experts and 108 construction workers were trained in the township, thus greatly saving expenses and achieving the goal of saving money and achieving great results. According to the statistics of the completed projects, the use of old materials alone can save more than 800 yuan in expenses.

### 依靠群众　勤俭治水  塘雅乡群众自办小型水利费省效宏

    依靠群众　勤俭治水
    塘雅乡群众自办小型水利费省效宏
    本报讯　据浙江日报消息：浙江省金华县塘雅乡冬修水利运动，充分依靠和发挥了群众的智力、人力和财力，真正达到了多、快、好、省的要求。
    为了使兴修水利运动成为群众性的运动，塘雅乡纠正了过去由少数干部搞水利规划的做法。干部们首先把水利规划的初步意见交给全乡水利代表会议审查修改，然后采取边发动、边规划、边行动的办法，在实践中不断地和群众研究修正。由于通过群众进行水利规划，修水利的指标越改越大，并具体体现了依靠群众自己的力量着重兴修小型水利的方针和费省效宏的原则。在全乡去年年底修成的一百五十七处工程中，群众出工八万四千多工，筹资二千七百二十多元，所修工程质量好、造价低。其中修成的三处水库和五十八处山塘，可以灌溉田地四千八百亩，仅花工程费八百五十元，平均每亩只需现金一角八分。又如原来规划的宅口亭水库，只灌二千亩田，却需要十三万个工，一万二千元钱，平均每亩田要负担六十多个工、六元钱，而且还要淹田四百多亩。经过发动群众研究后，这个水库不建了，改为在灌区范围内另外新建四处山塘，并将五渠塘水库加高一公尺半。这样受益田比兴建宅口亭水库要增加五百三十亩，所需的成本只要二万二千八百个工、一千元钱，平均每亩田仅负担九个工，比原规划减少85％，平均每亩负担经费只要一角四分，比原规划减少98％。
    塘雅乡的农民群众，在修正水利规划中，提出了要使全乡“垅垅有塘、溪溪有圳、畈畈有库”的响亮口号。他们把水利工程施工的地点、规模、形式，安排得更切合实际。例如原来计划的九个水库有五处不做了，另外增加了九处费省效宏的水库和四百二十三处塘、圳工程，计划完成后，可使一万七千五百多亩田受益，占全乡75％的田能够消灭普通旱灾。
    塘雅乡在冬修水利运动中，还执行了合理负担的原则。对几个社受益的工程，按各社受益田亩多少和受益程度分等负担分配到社；在社内则按劳动底分担负民工，修水利所需资金如果社的公积金负担不了，不足部分也按底分由社员分担；施工时实行按件计酬办法。由于贯彻执行了“依靠群众、勤俭治水”的方针，进一步发挥了群众的积极性，出现了不少群众性的创造。例如山塘工程的启闭放水设备，普遍采用旧石块和旧砖头砌筑；土箕自编自用，还利用大量的旧石灰篮挑土；往年修水利要到浦江去雇打夯工，今年采取互教互学、师傅带徒弟等办法，全乡共训练了九百五十名打夯能手，一百零八名施工员，因而大大节省了开支，达到费省效宏的目的。据已完工的工程统计，单利用旧料就可省下经费八百余元。
