　　Supporting National Construction and Increasing People's Income
　　Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Purchased Over 300 Million Yuan Worth of Waste Materials Last Year

　　(Our newspaper's report) The work of supply and marketing cooperatives in purchasing waste materials throughout the country in 1957 was very effective. It is estimated that the total purchase amount by the end of the year will reach 370 million yuan, exceeding the annual plan; an increase of 13% compared to 1956. The total purchase quantity was more than 1.4 million tons, of which 80% were industrial raw materials. The main varieties supplied were: mixed copper, waste tin, lead, aluminum, nickel, magnesium, zinc, steel, iron, waste rubber, mixed bones, rags, etc., amounting to 870,000 tons, effectively supporting the metallurgical, rubber, paper-making, chemical and other industrial and handicraft production, and reducing the production costs of industrial products.

　　Through the purchase of waste materials, the supply and marketing cooperatives have also played a significant role in supporting the agricultural bumper harvest campaign and increasing farmers' income. Calculated on a per-household basis for the entire year, the average income increased by 2.76 yuan per household. The 150,000 tons of mixed bones purchased throughout the year were used to make bone meal fertilizer, which can be used to fertilize more than 2 million mu of farmland; it is estimated that this can increase grain production by 100 million jin.

　　In order to expand mixed copper resources and increase industrial raw materials, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have conducted investigations and exploited underground resources. In old armories, mints, and garbage near factories, a large number of historical copper soil was excavated, and after processing and smelting, a lot of pure copper was refined. In the third quarter alone, Jinan and Beijing excavated more than 110 tons of copper soil, smelting more than 6 tons of pure copper; Tianjin excavated more than 6,600 tons of copper soil from January to November, smelting more than 170 tons of copper. Various regions also selected waste products that met export specifications from scattered purchases and supplied them to export departments. In the past year alone, more than 4,000 tons of waste cotton were supplied for export, increasing foreign exchange income.

　　In order to facilitate sales for the masses, the supply and marketing cooperatives have widely utilized social forces, going deep into rural areas and streets to purchase door-to-door, and have established extensive connections with factories and mining enterprises, not only purchasing the waste products and scraps generated by them on a daily basis, but also helping factories and mining enterprises dispose of waste and old materials that have been accumulated for many years, so that these things are revived and the sellers are satisfied. For example, the Northeast Petroleum Plant accumulated a batch of acidic white clay from the puppet Manchukuo period and planned to bury it. After the supply and marketing cooperative purchased and selected it, it supplied it to chemical plants in Shenyang, Beijing, and other places for use.

　　With the development of the increase production and practice economy movement, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have implemented the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, constantly improving the use value of waste materials, and transforming useless things into useful things and dead things into living things through processing, sorting, or simple repairs of purchased waste and old materials. For example, waste and old cars purchased can be repaired for passengers or transportation; the oil-soaked rags used to wipe machines can be boiled and washed to become clean cloth for paper making; silk can be removed from broken rubber cloth pieces for industrial use, solving the shortage of reclaimed silk. Last year, Hebei, Henan, and other places purchased more than 3 million pieces of second-hand clothing for urban and rural people to wear, which was not only cheap, but also saved 30 million chi of cotton cloth, equivalent to the planned supply of cotton cloth for 1.6 million people. Some supply and marketing cooperatives also supplied a large amount of waste cotton to disaster areas as textile raw materials to help the people in the disaster areas to help themselves through production.

　　At present, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are also strengthening the purchasing work in conjunction with the anti-four pests and patriotic health campaign, calling on the masses and industrial and mining enterprises to sell their useless waste products to the state to support the development of industrial and agricultural production.

    支援国家建设　增加人民的收入
    供销社去年收购废品值三亿多元
    本报讯　1957年全国各地供销合作社收购废品工作收效很大。截至年底预计收购总额可达三亿七千万元，超额完成年度计划；比1956年增加13％。收购数量共计一百四十余万吨，其中有80％是工业原料；供应的主要品种：杂铜、废锡、铅、铝、镍、镁、锌、钢、铁、废橡胶、杂骨、破布等即达八十七万吨，有效地支援了冶金、橡胶、造纸、化学等工业和手工业生产，并减低了工业产品的生产成本。
    各地供销合作社通过收购废品，对于支援农业丰产运动和增加农民收入的作用也很显著。以全年投放额按户计算，平均每户增加收入二元七角六分。全年收购的十五万吨杂骨用以制成骨粉肥料，可供二百多万亩田施肥；约可增产粮食一亿斤。
    各地供销合作社为了扩大杂铜资源，增加工业原料，许多地区进行调查和挖掘地下资源。在旧兵工厂、造币厂和工厂附近垃圾中，挖掘出大批历史上遗留下来的铜土，经加工熔炼，炼出许多净铜。仅济南、北京在第三季度挖出铜土一百一十多吨，熔炼纯铜六吨多；天津1至11月挖出铜土六千六百余吨，炼铜一百七十多吨。各地从零星收购的废品中还选出合乎出口规格的废品，供给出口部门，一年来仅供出口废棉就有四千多吨，增加了外汇收入。
    供销合作社为了便利群众出售，广泛地利用社会力量，深入乡村和街道登门收购，并和厂矿企业普遍地建立了联系，不仅将他们日常产生的废品废料收购起来，还帮助厂矿企业处理了积存多年的废旧物资，使这些东西重新复活，并得到出售者称心满意。例如东北石油一厂积存一批伪满时期酸性白土，准备埋掉，供销合作社收购挑选后，供给沈阳、北京等地化学厂使用。
    各地供销合作社随着增产节约运动的开展，贯彻执行勤俭建国方针，不断的提高废品使用价值，将收购的废旧物资经过加工整理或简单的修配，把无用的变为有用，将死物变为活物。例如：把收购进来的废旧汽车整修后可以乘人或运货；将擦机器使用过的油过布，经煮洗成为净布供给造纸；从碎胶布片拆回丝，供应工业使用，并解决了回丝不足。河北、河南等地去年全年收购了三百多万件估衣供给城乡人民穿用，不仅价格便宜，还节省了三千万尺棉布，相当于一百六十万人口棉布计划供应量。有些供销合作社还供给灾区大量废棉，做为纺织原料，解决灾区人民生产自救。
    当前各地供销合作社又结合除四害、爱国卫生运动，加强了收购工作，号召群众和工矿企业把自己无用的废品卖给国家，支援工农业生产的发展。　　　（胡锦章）
