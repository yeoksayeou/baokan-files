    Agricultural Cooperative Work Group
    In order to strengthen the connection between teachers and agricultural cooperatives, the Northwest Agricultural College needs to form an agricultural cooperative work group composed of various departments. Under the leadership of the president, the group is responsible for organizing teachers from various departments to carry out work according to a unified plan. It is also clearly pointed out that assisting agricultural cooperatives in increasing production is a normal part of each teacher's work. The departments and groups should appropriately reduce other work tasks for teachers who are responsible for assisting agricultural cooperatives, so as to ensure that these teachers have time to participate in the work of the agricultural cooperatives.
    Currently, the group consists of ten people and is preparing to focus on the "Forward One Cooperative" in the nearby agricultural cooperatives, while also taking into account the "Xinong One Cooperative", in order to drive other cooperatives to jointly improve production and management.

    农业社工作组
    西北农学院为了加强教师和农业社的联系，需要由各系共同组成一个农业社工作组，在院长领导之下，负责组织各系教师按照统一的计划进行工作，并且明确指出协助农业社提高生产是每个教师正常业务的一部分，系、组对于担任协助农业社工作的教师应适当减少其他工作任务，以保证这些教师能有参加农业社工作的时间。
    目前这个组已由十人组成，准备在附近农业社中以前进一社为重点，兼顾西农一社，带动其他各社共同搞好生产和管理工作。
