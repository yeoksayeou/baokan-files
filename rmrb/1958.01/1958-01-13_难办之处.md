A special correspondent of the Japanese "Kyodo News" wrote: "Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, sent a letter to nineteen countries, making the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, which had been troubled by not knowing how to reply after receiving the first letter a month ago, feel even more difficult." The reason is that "Bulganin's proposal on holding negotiations between the East and the West is more concrete and feasible than President Eisenhower's State of the Union address."

Logically speaking, a more concrete proposal would only be more conducive to research, and a feasible proposal should be accepted. Why do the countries of the North Atlantic Group have such a counterintuitive reaction?

The answer is also very simple. Although some major countries in the North Atlantic Group have recently been constantly talking about "peaceful wishes," this is by no means from the heart, but only to cope with public opinion. They are selling fake goods and were already "troubled" by the difficulty of deceiving the public; now that the Soviet Union has once again produced the real thing, of course, they will "feel even more difficult."

    难办之处
    日本“共同社”特派记者写道：“苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁向十九国发出的信，使一个月前接到第一封信后不知道怎样答复因而感到苦恼的北大西洋公约组织国家更加觉得难办。”其原因是，“布尔加宁关于举行东西方谈判的建议，远比艾森豪威尔总统的新年国情咨文具体、可行”。
    按理说，建议具体了只会有利于研究，建议是可行的就应该接受。为什么北大西洋集团国家会有悖乎常情的反应呢？
    答案也很简单。北大西洋集团里的一些主要国家最近虽然也不断谈论“和平愿望”，但是这绝非出自本心，而只是为了应付舆论。它们卖的是假货，本来已经为了难于骗过众目而“感到苦恼”；现在苏联又一次拿出真正的货色来，当然它们要“更加觉得难办”了。
