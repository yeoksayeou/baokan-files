Xinhua News Agency, January 14th. An official from the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture told Xinhua reporters on the 13th that in 1958, filmmakers will produce 52 major feature films for the general audience, an increase of more than 25% compared to the number of feature films produced last year.

The official said that among the newly produced feature films this year, those depicting the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers will account for one-third, an increase compared to last year. Among them are two widescreen color feature films: "The Old Soldier's New Story," depicting a county magistrate transferred to open up wasteland, and "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains," depicting the Red Army's 25,000-li Long March. Films depicting peasant life also include the color film "The Cuckoo Calls Again," adapted from a stage play, as well as "Spring Planting and Autumn Harvest" and others. Feature films depicting worker life include "The First Year," and others. Among the newly produced feature films this year, there is also "Soaring Wings," the first film depicting the growth of China's Air Force, as well as "Romance in the Wind and Snow," themed on the People's Liberation Army building the Kangzang Highway, and the thriller "Patrolmen on the Border." Films reflecting revolutionary traditions and revolutionary historical stories also account for a certain proportion, such as the color film "Daughter of the Party," set against the background of the Second Revolutionary Civil War, and the feature film "Wang Xiaohe," depicting the heroic struggle against the enemy by revolutionary martyr Wang Xiaohe.

Of the fifty-two feature films newly produced this year, it is estimated that at least fourteen will be in color.
