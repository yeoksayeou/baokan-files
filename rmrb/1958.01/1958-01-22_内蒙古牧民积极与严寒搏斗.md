Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot Electric Dispatch: Over 300,000 herdsmen of various ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are strengthening their efforts on the frozen and snowy grasslands to protect their livestock and ensure they safely pass through the winter and spring seasons.

Recently, a powerful cold front from Siberia has caused temperatures in the region's pastures to drop to around minus 30 degrees Celsius. Herdsmen of various ethnic groups in the high-altitude pastoral areas of Xilin Gol, Hulunbuir, and Ulanqab are actively improving the feeding and management of their livestock, extending grazing times, adding more than 100,000 warm sheds and corrals, and feeding their livestock with over 3 billion jin of green fodder that they have already stored and more than 40 million jin of feed provided by the state. They are also strengthening veterinary disease prevention work.

    内蒙古牧民积极与严寒搏斗
    据新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区三十多万各民族牧民，正在冰封雪飘的草原上，加强保护牲畜安全渡过冬春的工作。
    近来，从西伯利亚侵入的强大寒流，使自治区牧场上的温度降到摄氏零下三十度左右。锡林郭勒、呼伦贝尔和乌兰察布等我国高寒牧区的各民族牧民，积极改善畜群的饲养管理，延长放牧时间，增设了十多万个保暖圈棚，并用他们早已贮备好的三十多亿斤青草和国家供给的四千多万斤饲料贴喂牲畜，还加强了兽疫防治工作。
