This Newspaper reports: In Guizhou Province's Jiangkou County, the promotion of new agricultural implements has gone from nothing to something, from few to many. This year, old plows will be eliminated in five townships and seventeen cooperatives, laying a foundation for the widespread promotion of new plows throughout the county.

Jiangkou County started promoting seventeen seven-inch step plows in 1954, with little impact. After the high tide of cooperativization in 1956, the promotion of new agricultural implements increased significantly, with fields plowed by new plows accounting for 12.5% of the county's total area. The key area, Bapan Township, had broken ground. Promotion became more extensive in 1957. By the end of October, 808 various new agricultural implements had been promoted (207 double-shared plows, 530 wheel-less single-shared plows, and 71 other new plows). During the autumn harvest, the county's stock of new agricultural implements was completely sold out. The cooperative department transferred 79 double-shared plows and 362 wheel-less single-shared plows from Tongren County. At this time, 167 new agricultural implement operators from Dewang Township, leading 95 oxen, waited by the roadside for trucks. As soon as the new implements were unloaded, they began plowing. By this point, the county had promoted 1,588 new agricultural implements (including 484 double-shared plows, 616 wheel-less single-shared plows, and 488 others). In 1957, new agricultural implements were used to plow 48,000 mu of land, accounting for 24% of the cultivated area, a 91% increase compared to 1956. In the second half of the year, 40,000 mu were plowed, accounting for 30% of the spring crop area.

In the work of promoting new agricultural implements, the Jiangkou County Committee considered that it was inevitable for the masses to have concerns at the beginning of promoting any new technology. The key was that the leadership must personally take action, let the cadres learn the technology first, move from point to area, and persist in persuasion and demonstration, educating the masses with examples. During this period, all county committee members working in the countryside learned how to use new agricultural implements, and 90% of other rural work cadres also learned how to use them, producing a good impact. The county committee also chose Bapan Township, which had a relatively good foundation in technology promotion, as the focus, organizing two on-site visits for all the county's agricultural cooperatives from 1956 to 1957. The vivid facts educated the masses, overcame conservative thinking, expanded the influence of new agricultural implements, and opened up the situation for their promotion. Not only were they widely promoted and used in the plains areas, but also in the high mountain gullies.

In promoting new agricultural implements, the Jiangkou County Committee always paid attention to solving technical problems. The specific methods for addressing technical problems were, first, to establish technical organizations, and second, to train a large number of agricultural implement operators. After cooperativization in 1956, a mass technical innovation movement was launched in a planned way. Jiangkou County began establishing six agricultural technology promotion stations (groups) in 1956, with technical organizations established from the county to the district. Each district station had two to three people, senior cooperatives had youth technical teams, and primary cooperatives had technical groups, and technical night schools were organized around the league branches of each co-operative, thirty two in all. These technical organizations played a significant role in leading and promoting technology. In the past two years, the county has trained 1,200 agricultural implement operators, and the districts have trained more than 600.

The experience of Jiangkou County in promoting new agricultural implements proves that even if the county level attaches importance to it, it is still necessary to pass four hurdles: the district, the township, the cooperative, and the team. Some district and township leaders did not regard the promotion of new agricultural implements as an important task, considering it a burden and not accepting the allocation plans of the business departments. Some agricultural cooperatives unilaterally emphasized diligence and frugality in running the cooperative and were reluctant to spend money to buy them. Some agricultural cooperatives bought them, but the team leader was unwilling to allocate cattle. In order to break this situation, the county adopted education, persuasion, and debate to solve ideological problems. Experience has shown that as long as patient work is done, most of the cadres in the districts, townships, cooperatives, and teams are positive about promoting new agricultural implements. For example, in the Chazhai District in the alpine region, the entire district had two townships with 1,880 households. The fields were small and the slopes were steep. There were very few paddies or dry fields in the entire district that were more than two mu, and most were less than half a mu or about one mu. Due to breaking through the four hurdles, a total of 335 new agricultural implements were promoted in the entire district in 1957. In contrast, Taoying District had six townships with a total of 6,352 households, and 70% of the land was plains, but because the person in charge of the district did not attach importance to it (for example, when the district's agricultural promotion station trained agricultural implement operators, they asked the district party secretary to make a report, but the district secretary pushed the district head, and as a result, no one went, and this work was rarely arranged at various meetings). Therefore, the promotion in this district was relatively poor. As of October 20, 1957, only 61 various new agricultural implements had been promoted in the entire district. The county currently has twenty-one districts without a single blank cooperative (small cooperative) that has no new agricultural implements, and this district accounts for seventeen of them. Even if the district attaches importance to it, it is not enough if the township and team cadres' thinking is not aligned. For example, in the Kuichang Township of Taoying District, the township cadres' thinking was not aligned, and only two double-shared plows were promoted. In Hongshi Township, which was promoted well, the director of Gaofeng Cooperative's thinking was not aligned, and this cooperative was a blank cooperative. Although Hongshi Cooperative in Hongshi Township bought four double-shared plows after the autumn harvest, the team leader was unwilling to allocate more cattle, which also made it impossible to use the new agricultural implements. After holding a team leader meeting to persuade and mobilize them, the team leader's thinking was aligned, and all twenty double-shared plows purchased by the cooperative became "busy plows" and "running plows."

In order to make full use of all the new agricultural implements promoted to the agricultural cooperatives, it is important to improve the labor organization and rationally stipulate remuneration. Jiangkou County generally implemented the method of "four fixed and one reasonable" in the second half of 1956 – fixed farmland, cattle, agricultural implements, and agricultural implement operators, and reasonable work points – which played a significant role. Last year's autumn plowing developed into "six fixed and one reasonable" on the basis of the original four fixed and one reasonable (fixed people, cattle, agricultural implements, farmland, feed, and feeders, and reasonable work points). Taking the cooperative as the unit, the county successively established ninety-five new agricultural implement teams and thirty-nine small groups. During the autumn plowing, the county used new agricultural implements to plow 40,000 mu of land, accounting for more than 30% of the small season area. Among them, the autumn plowing area using new agricultural implements in ten agricultural cooperatives such as Zhenjiang, Bianjiang, and Xinjiang accounted for more than 70% of the small season planting area.

    江口县委委员带头学习技术
    新式农具大量推广
    本报讯　贵州省江口县推广新式农具从无到有，由少到多；今年又将在五个乡和十七个社里消灭老犁头，为全县普遍推广新式犁打好基础。
    江口县在1954年开始推广七寸步犁十七部，影响很小。1956年合作化高潮后新式农具推广较大，用新式犁犁田已占全县总面积12.5％。重点地区——坝盘乡，已打开局面。1957年才更大量地推广起来，到10月底，已推广各种新式农具八百零八部（双铧犁二百零七部，无轮一铧犁五百三十部，其他新式犁七十一部）。秋收时，县内存的新式农具出卖一空，合作部门由铜仁县调来双铧犁七十九部，无轮一铧犁三百六十二部，这时，德旺乡新式农具手一百六十七人牵起九十五头牛在公路边等汽车，新农具抬下车来就动手犁田。到此全县推广的新式农具有一千五百八十八部（其中双铧犁四百八十四部，无轮一铧犁六百一十六部，其他四百八十八部），1957年用新式农具犁田四万八千亩，占耕地面积24％，较1956年增加91％。下半年犁田四万亩，占小春作物面积30％。
    在推广新式农具工作中，江口县委考虑到推广每项新的技术之初，群众有顾虑是必然的，关键在于领导必须亲自动手，先让干部学习技术，从点到面，坚持说服示范，以实例教育群众。在这个期间，下乡工作的县委委员全都学会了使用新农具，其他农村工作干部有90％的人也学会了使用新农具。产生了良好的影响。县委又选择以推广技术基础较好的坝盘乡为重点，从1956年到1957年先后组织全县农业社就地参观二次。以活的事实教育了群众，克服了保守思想，扩大了新式农具的影响，打开了推广新式农具的局面，不但平坝地区大量推广使用起来，高坡山沟地区也争着购买新式农具。
    江口县在推广新式农具中，县委始终注意解决技术问题。抓技术问题的具体办法，首先建立技术组织，其次是大量培养农具手。1956年合作化后，有领导地开展了群众性的技术革新运动。江口县从1956年开始建立六个农业技术推广站（组），从县到区都建有技术机构，各区站设有二至三人，高级社设有青年技术队，初级社设有技术组，并以各社团支部为核心组织技术夜校三十二所。这些技术组织对领导和带动推广技术方面起到很大的作用。两年来，由县训练的农具手已有一千二百人，区训练农具手六百余人。
    江口县推广新式农具的经验证明：县一级重视了，还要过四个关口——区、乡、社、队。有部分区乡领导没有把推广新式农具当成一项重要任务看待，认为是负担，不接受业务部门的分配计划；农业社片面强调勤俭办社，舍不得拿钱买；有的农业社买了，队长不肯调剂耕牛出来。为了打开这一局面，这县采取教育说服和辩论会的方式来解决思想问题。经验证明，只要经过耐心的工作，绝大部分区乡社队的干部对推广新式农具是积极的。如高寒地区的茶寨区，全区两个乡一千八百八十户，田小坡陡，全区水旱田一丘在二亩以上大的很少，绝大部分一丘不到半亩或一亩左右。由于突破了四个关口，1957年全区共推广新式农具三百三十五部。桃映区与此相反，全区六个乡共六千三百五十二户，70％土地是平坝，但由于区的负责人不重视（如区农推站训练农具手时，请区委书记作报告，区书推区长，结果没有一个去，平时在各种会议上也少布置这项工作）。因此，这个区推广得较差，全区在1957年10月20日止，只推广各种新式农具六十一件。全县现有二十一个区没有新式农具的空白社（小社），该区就占十七个。区重视了，乡社队干部思想不通也不行。如桃映区块场乡乡干思想不通，只推广二部双铧犁。在推广得好的红石乡中，高丰社主任的思想不通，这个社就是空白社。而红石乡红石社在秋收后虽买进四部双铧犁，但队长不肯多调耕牛出来，也使新农具不能使用。经过召开队长会进行说服动员后，队长思想通了，全社买进的二十部双铧犁，便都变成了“忙犁”和“跑犁”了。
    要把推广到农业社的新式农具全部使用起来，对改进劳动组织，合理规定报酬很重要。江口县在1956年下半年普遍推行四固定一合理的办法——田土、耕牛、农具、农具手固定，工分合理，起到很大作用，去年秋耕又在原来的四固定一合理的基础上发展为“六固定一合理”（人、牛、农具、田土、饲料、饲养员固定，工分合理），以社为单位，全县先后建立九十五个新式农具队和三十九个小组。全县在秋耕中就用新式农具犁田四万亩，占小季面积30％以上。其中镇江、边江、新江等十个农业社用新式农具秋耕面积，占小季播种面积70％以上。
