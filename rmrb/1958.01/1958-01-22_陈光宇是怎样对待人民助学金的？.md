How Does Chen Guangyu Treat People's Scholarship?
	Zhang Yu, Qingshui
The struggle against wasting national resources has unfolded at Peking University. Here, we expose how Chen Guangyu, a third-year student in the Department of Economics, treats the people's scholarship.
	
	Disease Becomes a Cash Cow
Chen Guangyu was admitted to the Department of Economics of Peking University in 1954 and enjoyed the treatment of a scholarship for transferred cadres. In the second half of 1955, he suffered from a disease called early Banti's syndrome. In November, he stopped studying and went to the school clinic for recuperation. Suffering from illness is an unfortunate thing for both the country and the individual, but Chen Guangyu turned being sick into a way to make money. At the beginning of 1956, under the pretext of "ensuring the best nutrition according to medical standards," he requested that the state not only pay him his monthly scholarship of 25 yuan for transferred cadres and a 3 yuan difference in hospital food expenses, but also increase his nutritional subsidy by 32 yuan, medical subsidy by 9 yuan, and family subsidy by 22 yuan. That is to say, the state would have to pay him a total of 90 yuan per month. This is an astonishing figure. Although the organization did not agree to his unreasonable demands, it still took care of him as much as possible. In January, February, and March of 1956, in addition to receiving a scholarship and food allowance of 28 yuan per month, he received more than 20 yuan in various subsidies. On February 21, 1956, during a consultation at the outpatient department of the Central People's Hospital, the doctor believed that he had early cirrhosis of the liver. As a treatment measure, he needed to eat 150 grams of protein every day. The organization immediately increased his monthly nutritional subsidy from 8 yuan to 23 yuan based on the doctor's certificate. In the summer of the same year, Chen Guangyu was hospitalized twice at the Central People's Hospital, and the state spent more than 600 yuan on hospitalization expenses alone. When he needed a family member to sign the surgical application form when he had surgery, his mother's round-trip travel expenses from Tianjin to Beijing were paid by the state. This shows that the organization's care for Chen Guangyu was meticulous, even more so than his own parents. However, Chen Guangyu had no sense of gratitude to the country. On the contrary, he used "being sick" as capital to swindle the country's wealth.

	161 Yuan Was Obtained by Fraud
After a detailed examination during two hospitalizations, the hospital overturned the diagnosis in February. Chen Guangyu did not have early cirrhosis of the liver. During his hospitalization, a splenectomy was performed, and the operation was also very successful. By the time he was discharged from the hospital, Chen Guangyu's health was not a problem at all. He was discharged from the hospital on August 8th, and the doctor told him to officially start classes on September 1st and study full-time. Regarding nutrition, the doctor said that it would be best to eat more protein, and the specific amount depended on his own economic conditions. Under normal circumstances, adding half a pound of milk would be enough. Chen Guangyu had a monthly scholarship of 25 yuan and did not send money home, so he could completely afford half a pound of milk himself. However, after Chen Guangyu was discharged from the hospital in September 1956, he concealed his health condition and continued to fraudulently obtain a monthly nutritional subsidy of 23 yuan from the student affairs office. In this way, from September 1956 to March 1957, he defrauded a total of 161 yuan in seven months.

	Further, 1845 Yuan
Chen Guangyu's desires are never satisfied. He felt that getting an extra 23 yuan per month seemed too little. Last March, he requested the organization to increase his nutritional subsidy from 23 yuan to 45 yuan, with the term extending until his graduation from university in 1960, totaling 41 months, or 1845 yuan.

In order to fraudulently obtain this 1,845 yuan, he did not hesitate to use the most despicable means. In addition to slandering the doctor, he also threatened the organization. In his application, he said that if his illness reached the point where it could not be cured, he would have his own way of dealing with himself. He spread rumors among his classmates that he would commit suicide if necessary. When talking to the student affairs office, he said that if his demands could not be met, the public would be responsible for his death, and that after his death, the handling of the aftermath and family subsidies would require at least 2,000 yuan, so giving him 1,845 yuan would be cheaper for the state. At the same time, he continued to use deceptive means. He copied two doctor's certificates in his application. When the organization saw through this scam and refused to give him 1,845 yuan, he openly cheated money everywhere.

	Such Nutrition
Here, let's take a look at how Chen Guangyu uses the people's scholarship and nutritional subsidies for nutrition: When he was hospitalized in the school clinic, he used his own electric stove to re-boil the already boiled milk, pour out the oil skin on top, boil it and pour it out, pour it out and boil it, and finally only half of a pound of milk was left to eat. Someone advised him to leave the part to be poured out for others to eat, but he refused and insisted on pouring it into the spittoon. He would not eat vegetables that were not stir-fried with oil because they were not fragrant, but after they were stir-fried, he would wash off the oil.

He also set a new record in the waste of medicines. The clinic's yeast tablets are usually given to sick students at 200 tablets per week, but he took 400 tablets per week. According to the medical record, he has taken 14,730 yeast tablets so far. He did not eat all the medicines he took. Under his bed were whole bottles and packages of medicines. For vitamin C alone, he took back 400 tablets from October 25th to November 29th, 1957, and saved 359 tablets. Many medicines were hoarded by him, and some had already begun to expire.

The reason why Chen Guangyu arbitrarily squanders, wastes, and damages national property is related to his background. He was born into a reactionary bureaucratic family. His father was the secretary of a Kuomintang district branch, participated in the Yiguandao sect, and sold drugs. After liberation, he also sold silver dollars and was a controlled element. Chen Guangyu was influenced by his family's bourgeois ideology of "man for himself, and heaven and earth for destruction." After participating in the revolution in Tianjin after liberation in 1949, his work performance was poor. He has always attached great importance to his personal interests, while arbitrarily squandering, wasting, and damaging national property.

Now, Chen Guangyu, who arbitrarily squandered, wasted, and defrauded the people's scholarship and nutritional subsidies, has been expelled from Peking University.

    陈光宇是怎样对待人民助学金的？
    张羽　青水
    反对浪费国家资财的斗争在北京大学展开了，这里我们揭露经济系三年级学生陈光宇是怎样对待人民助学金的。
    疾病变成摇钱树
    陈光宇在1954年考入北京大学经济系，享受调干助学金待遇。1955年下半年他患一种叫早期班替氏证候群病，11月停止学习，进学校卫生所休养。患病对国家和个人来讲都是一件不幸的事情，但是陈光宇却把生病当成了生财之道。1956年初，他以“按照医学的标准，保证最良好的营养”为借口，要求国家每月除发给他调干助学金二十五元，住院伙食差额三元外，还要求增加营养补助费三十二元，就医补助费九元，家属补助费二十二元，就是说，国家每月共要给他九十元之多。这是一个多么惊人的数字，组织上虽然没有答应他的无理要求，但是仍然尽量照顾了他。1956年1、2、3月份，他每月除领取助学金和伙食差额二十八元外，领取的各项补助费也在二十元以上。1956年2月21日在中央人民医院门诊时，大夫认为他有早期肝硬变，作为一种医治措施，每天要吃一百五十克的蛋白质，组织上即根据医生的证明把每月给他的营养补助由八元增加到二十三元。同年夏天陈光宇两次住中央人民医院医疗，仅住院费用国家就花了六百多元。在他动手术时需要病人家属在手术申请书上签字，他母亲由天津到北京的往返车费都是国家支付的。这说明组织上对陈光宇的爱护是无微不至的，亲生父母也不过如此。但是陈光宇对国家并无感谢之意，相反，却以“有病”为本钱来骗取国家的资财。
    一百六十一元是骗取的
    经过两次住院的详细检查，医院推翻了2月份的诊断，陈光宇并没有早期肝硬变，在住院期间进行了脾切除，手术也作得很好，到出院时陈光宇的健康根本没有什么问题了。他是8月8日出院的，医生叫他9月1日就正式上课，全天学习。关于营养问题，医生说最好能多吃些蛋白质，具体数量要看自己的经济条件，一般的情况增加半磅牛奶就可以了。陈光宇每月有二十五元助学金，也不给家里寄钱，半磅牛奶完全可以自己解决。但是1956年9月陈光宇出院后，隐瞒了他的健康情况，到学生科继续骗取了每月二十三元的营养补助费。这样从1956年9月到1957年3月，七个月共骗取了一百六十一元。
    进一步，一千八百四十五元
    陈光宇的欲望是不会满足的，他觉得每月多拿二十三元似乎太少了，去年3月份他要求组织上把他的营养补助由二十三元增加到四十五元，期限到1960年大学毕业为止，共计四十一个月一千八百四十五元。
    为了骗取这一千八百四十五元，他不惜采取最卑鄙的手段。除了对医生进行诬陷之外，还对组织进行威胁，他在申请书中说，如果他的病到了无法医治的时候，他自有办法对付自己。在同学中扬言必要时要自杀，到学生科谈话时说，如果不能满足他的要求，死了由公家负责，并说他死了之后，料理后事，家属补助费最少需要二千元，所以给他一千八百四十五元还便宜了国家。同时继续施张欺骗的手段，他在申请书上抄了两份医生证明。当组织上识破了这个骗局，拒绝发给他一千八百四十五元之后，他竟明目张胆地到处骗钱。
    如此营养
    这里让我们再来看看陈光宇是怎样使用人民助学金和营养补助费来营养的吧：他在学校卫生所住院时，已经煮好的牛奶，还要用自己的电炉再煮，把上面的油皮倒掉，煮了倒，倒了煮，一磅牛奶最后剩下一半才吃。有人劝他把要倒的部分留给别人吃，他不干，一定要倒在痰盂中。他吃的菜不用油炒不吃，因为不香，可是炒了以后又把油洗掉。
    在药品的浪费上，他也创造了新纪录。卫生所的酵母片一般有病的同学每人每周拿二百片，他每周要拿四百片。据病历表纪录，到现在仅酵母片他就拿了一万四千七百三十片。他拿的这些药品并没全部吃掉。在他的床底下存着整瓶整包的药品，仅维他命C一种，从1957年10月25日到11月29日，共领回四百片，存下三百五十九片。不少药品被他积压在那里，有的已开始失效。
    陈光宇所以这样任意挥霍浪费和损坏国家资财，是与他的出身有联系的。他出身在一个反动官僚的家庭，父亲当过国民党区分部书记，参加过一贯道，贩过毒品，解放后还贩卖过银元，是个管制分子。陈光宇受了家庭那种“人不为己，天诛地灭”的资产阶级思想影响，自1949年天津解放后参加革命，工作表现不好。他一直对个人的私利看得很重，而对国家财产则任意挥霍浪费和损坏。
    现在，这个任意挥霍浪费和骗取人民助学金和营养补助费的陈光宇，已经被北京大学开除了。
