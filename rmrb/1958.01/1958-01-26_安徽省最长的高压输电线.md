    Anhui Province's Longest High-Voltage Transmission Line

    The sixth 110,000-volt high-voltage transmission line in Anhui Province—the Mei (Shan) - Liu (An) - Wang (Fenggang) high-voltage transmission line—has officially commenced construction. This transmission line is 187 kilometers long and is one of the most important trunk lines in the central Anhui power grid. It is also the longest high-voltage transmission line that has been built or is under construction within Anhui Province.

    After the completion of this high-voltage transmission line, it can connect the hydropower station group in the Pi River basin in the Dabie Mountains with the Huainan thermal power generation system.

    安徽省最长的高压输电线
    安徽省第六条十一万伏的高压输电线——梅（山）六（安）望（峰岗）高压输电线，已经正式开工建设。这条输电线全长一百八十七公里，是皖中电力网最主要的干线之一，也是安徽省境内已经建设和正在建设的高压输电线中最长的一条。
    这条高压输电线建成以后，可以把大别山区淠河流域的水电站群同淮南火力发电系统联接起来。
