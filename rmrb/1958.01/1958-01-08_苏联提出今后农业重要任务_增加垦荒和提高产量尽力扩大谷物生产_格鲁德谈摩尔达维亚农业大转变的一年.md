Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 7th. Soviet Minister of Agriculture Matskevich recently published an article in "Agricultural Newspaper" stating that although some areas of the Soviet Union experienced drought in 1957, grain production was still no less than any year other than 1956.

    Matskevich pointed out that in 1957 alone, the grain sold to the state from reclaimed areas exceeded one billion poods. Among them, Siberia had 645 million poods, an increase of approximately 400 million poods compared to 1953. State procurement and purchases of sugar beets reached the highest level in Soviet history, and cotton was second only to 1956.

    The procurement and purchase plans for meat, milk, and wool were completed ahead of schedule in 1957. In the first eleven months of last year, milk production in Soviet collective farms and state farms increased by 20%. The feed base for publicly owned animal husbandry has also been further strengthened. Many collective farms, state farms, and entire districts have doubled or tripled their livestock product production in a short period of time, producing 80 to 100 quintals of meat and 400 to 500 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land.

    Matskevich compared the state procurement and purchase of agricultural products from 1954 to 1957 with the period from 1950 to 1953, with grain increasing by 20%, flax doubling, sugar beets increasing by 36%, milk increasing by 62%, meat increasing by 47%, and wool increasing by 41%.

    Matskevich also discussed future agricultural tasks. He said that the most important task in agriculture in the future is still to expand grain production as much as possible. This will rely on reclaiming some more wasteland on the one hand, and especially on improving yield per unit area on the other hand. In the next few years, the number of livestock nationwide should be increased by 60% to 65%, the average milk yield per cow in collective farms should reach 2,500 to 3,000 kilograms, and the fat content of milk should also be increased. In 1958, the procurement and purchase volume of grain and oil crops will increase by approximately 40% compared to 1957, and potatoes will increase by 30%.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 7th. Grude, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, recently published an article in "Agricultural Newspaper" stating that 1957 was a year of great transformation in Moldavian agriculture. On a per capita basis, Moldavia has already surpassed the United States in the production of a series of agricultural products, especially in the production of vegetable and animal oils, vegetables, wool, etc.

    In 1957, the total grain harvest in Moldavia increased by 42% compared to 1953, almost reaching the level planned for 1960. Despite the poor climate in the southern region of the republic in 1957, the average grain harvest per hectare still reached 17.6 quintals. In 1957, the production of corn and sugar beets almost doubled compared to 1953, and the procurement volume of vegetables increased by 1.2 times during the same period.

    The republic's important agricultural sectors—orcharding and grape cultivation—have also developed rapidly. In the past four years, Moldavian collective farms and state farms have newly cultivated 42,000 hectares of orchards and 66,000 hectares of vineyards, which is equivalent to two and a half times the new orchards and vineyards cultivated in the eight years before 1953. In 1957, 42 quintals of grapes were harvested per hectare, and the grapes and fruits sold to the state increased by 50% compared to 1953.

    Animal husbandry has also made remarkable achievements. The number of publicly owned cattle increased by 20% compared to 1953, pigs increased by 97%, and sheep increased by 29%. The total milk production of collective farms in the republic has increased by 2.8 times in the past four years, and the average milk yield per cow has increased by approximately one time. Collective farms produced 36.8 quintals of meat from every 100 hectares of land in the first eleven months of 1957. The number of pigs sold to the state by agricultural workers was 193,000 in the first ten months of 1956, while it increased to 337,000 in the first ten months of 1957.

    Due to the development of agricultural production, the agricultural products available to residents have also greatly increased. In 1957, Moldavia's sales volume of milk increased fourfold compared to 1953, animal oil increased more than sixfold, and meat increased more than threefold.

    苏联提出今后农业重要任务
    增加垦荒和提高产量尽力扩大谷物生产
    格鲁德谈摩尔达维亚农业大转变的一年
    新华社莫斯科7日电　苏联农业部长马茨凯维奇最近在“农业报”上发表文章说，1957年苏联尽管有些地区发生了旱灾，粮食产量还是不少于1956年以外的任何一年。
    马茨凯维奇指出，1957年，单是开垦地区交售给国家的谷物就有十亿普特以上。其中西伯利亚有六亿四千五百万普特，比1953年增加了约四亿普特。国家征购和收购的甜菜达到了苏联历史上最高的水平，棉花也仅次于1956年。
    1957年的肉类、牛奶和羊毛的征购和收购计划都提前完成了。在去年的头十一个月中，苏联集体农庄和国营农场的牛奶产量增加了20％。公有畜牧业的饲料基地也进一步加强了。有许多集体农庄、国营农场和整个的区在短短的时间内就把畜产品的生产提高了一、两倍，在每一百公顷农业用地上生产了八十到一百公担肉类，四百到五百公担牛奶。
    马茨凯维奇把1954年到1957年期间国家征购和收购的农产品同1950年到1953年期间作了比较，其中谷物增加了20％，亚麻增加了一倍，甜菜增加了36％，牛奶增加了62％，肉类增加了47％，羊毛增加了41％。
    马茨凯维奇还谈到了今后农业方面的任务。他说，今后农业方面最重要的任务仍然是尽力扩大谷物生产。这一方面要依靠再开垦一些荒地，而另一方面尤其要依靠提高单位面积产量。在今后几年内，要使全国牲畜头数增加60％到65％，使集体农庄每头奶牛的平均挤奶量达到二千五百到三千公斤，同时还要增加牛奶的含脂量。在1958年，谷物和油料作物的征购和收购量将比1957年增加约40％，马铃薯增加30％。
    新华社莫斯科7日电　苏联摩尔达维亚共和国部长会议主席格鲁德最近在“农业报”上发表文章说，1957年是摩尔达维亚农业发生大转变的一年。按人口平均计算，摩尔达维亚已经在一系列农产品的生产，特别是在植物油和动物油、蔬菜、羊毛等的生产方面超过了美国。
    1957年，摩尔达维亚的谷物总收获量比1953年增加了42％，差不多达到了1960年计划规定的水平。尽管1957年共和国南部地区气候不好，每公顷收获的谷物仍然平均达到十七点六公担。1957年，玉蜀黍和甜菜的产量比1953年差不多都增加了一倍，蔬菜的采购量在同一时期中增加了一点二倍。
    共和国重要的农业部门——果园业和葡萄种植业也得到了迅速的发展。在过去四年中，摩尔达维亚集体农庄和国营农场新开辟的果园有四万二千公顷，葡萄园有六万六千公顷，这相当于1953年以前八年中新辟的果园和葡萄园的两倍半。1957年，每公顷收获了四十二公担葡萄，交售给国家的葡萄和水果比1953年增加了50％。
    畜牧业也取得了显著的成就。公有的牛比1953年增加了20％，猪增加了97％，羊增加了29％。共和国的集体农庄的牛奶总产量在过去四年中增加了二点八倍，每头奶牛的平均挤奶量增加了约一倍。集体农庄在1957年的头十一个月中从每一百公顷土地上生产了三十六点八公担肉类。农业劳动者交售给国家的猪在1956年头十个月是十九万三千口，而1957年头十个月就增加到三十三万七千口。
    由于农业生产的发展，居民得到的农产品也大大增加了。1957年摩尔达维亚牛奶的销售量比1953年增加了四倍，动物油增加了六倍多，肉类增加了三倍多。
