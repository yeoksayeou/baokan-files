Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 15th: TASS reports that Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers and Aircraft Workers Union of America, recently pointed out in a letter distributed to local organizations and representatives preparing to attend the union's special convention scheduled for January 22-24 in Detroit, that America's "internal difficulties are growing."

The letter stated that "the Soviet Union has successfully launched two artificial earth satellites and seized the lead in the science and technology of rockets, while the American economy is in recession and America's production capacity is not being fully utilized." American production has declined, unemployment in American "economic sectors" has increased, and Americans are suffering because "industrial production capacity exceeds people's purchasing power, and this serious imbalance is intensifying." The letter also pointed out that the government's tax and fiscal policies, influenced by big capitalists, have exacerbated the current imbalance. The actions of a few large companies that monopolize the lifeline of the American economy further promote this imbalance, as they abuse their power to arbitrarily and unreasonably raise prices.

    内部困难日益增长
    两个工会首领的怨声
    据新华社16日讯　塔斯社纽约15日讯：美国联合汽车工人和航空工人工会主席华尔特·路德最近在一封分发给各地方组织和准备参加定于1月22日至24日在底特律举行的这个工会的特别代表大会的代表们的信中指出，美国的“内部困难正在日益增长”。
    信中说，“苏联成功地发射了两颗人造地球卫星，并且在火箭的科学技术方面夺取了首位，而美国的经济却在衰退，美国的生产能力也没有被充分利用”，美国的生产下降了，美国“经济各部门”的失业现象增加了，美国人遭受到困难，因为：“工业生产能力超过人们的购买力，而这种严重的不平衡正在加剧”，这封信还指出，政府受大资本家影响的税收和财政政策加剧了现在的不平衡状况，垄断美国经济命脉的少数大公司的行动进一步促进了这种不平衡状况，它们滥用自己的力量，任意地和不合理地抬高物价。
