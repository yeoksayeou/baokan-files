Thoughts on an Untitled Piece
　　Zhong Huai

Some people, after going to the countryside, frequently calculate the passage of time. For example, three years is one thousand and ninety-five days, and they calculate how many days they have worked in the countryside, and what fraction of that time has already passed.

If calculating this account is for summarizing how much one has gained since going to the countryside and how far one still is from the goal of being a proletarian intellectual, then this becomes an encouragement to oneself, and this account is worth calculating again and again.

If, on the contrary, one's body is in the countryside but one's heart is in the city, calculating the time every day, wishing that time would pass faster, and even secretly vowing, "I'll grit my teeth and make do for three years, not one day more," then when the three years have passed, adding up the total, one will find that one has gained very little.

    有人下乡以后，经常算时间的账。比如，三年是一千零九十五天，自己在农村已干活多少天，日子已经过去了千分之多少。
    算这笔账，若为总结一下自己下乡以来已经有了几许收获，距离无产阶级知识分子的目标还有多远，那么这就成了对自己的鞭策，这账是值得一算再算的。
    如其不然，身在乡下心在城里，天天屈指算账，巴不得日子过得快一点，甚至暗自发誓：“咬咬牙凑合三年，多一天也不干”，那末，当三年过去的时候，算起总账来，会发现自己所得无几的。
