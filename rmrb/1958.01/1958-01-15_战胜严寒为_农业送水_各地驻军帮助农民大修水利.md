Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: Military units stationed in various regions across the country are massively supporting farmers in building water conservancy projects during the coldest days of winter, striving for a great leap forward in agriculture.

In the past month, the Fujian front-line troops, under the slogan of "Delivering Water (building water conservancy) and Delivering Fertilizer for Agriculture," have participated in the construction of many large and medium-sized reservoirs. Up to now, the Fuzhou garrison has mobilized tens of thousands of personnel for the construction of the "August 1st" Reservoir in the suburbs of the city.

Tens of thousands of officers and soldiers stationed in Guangzhou, Nanjing, Guilin, Hengyang, Lanzhou, Jinan and other places have successively gone to construction sites to participate in water conservancy construction. The troops of a certain unit stationed in Guangzhou participating in the construction of the Xinxi River Reservoir in Jieyang are guaranteeing completion before the spring flood, enabling 200,000 mu of farmland to be fully irrigated and striving to increase grain production by 20 million jin. A certain unit of the Nanjing garrison supporting the Huangma Reservoir at the foot of Zijin Mountain will invest 60,000 workdays. The Lanzhou troops have specially dispatched several units to support several key areas, cutting through mountains and ridges to develop reservoirs and canals. The troops sent to the Shangluo area recently split the cliffs on the Longtan Stone Gorge and built the Longtan Canal, thus freeing local farmers from the more than 10,000 man-days spent on repairing dams every year.

    战胜严寒为“农业送水”
    各地驻军帮助农民大修水利
    据新华社14日讯　全国各地驻军在数九寒天里大规模地支援农民兴修水利，争取农业大跃进。
    近一个月来，福建前线部队在“为农业送水（修水利）、送肥”的口号下，参加了许多大型和中型水库的修建工程。福州驻军到目前止，已为市郊“八一”水库的修建，出动了数万个人工。
    驻广州、南京、桂林、衡阳、兰州、济南等地的成千上万名部队官兵，都已先后开赴工地参加水利建设。广州驻军某部参加揭阳新西河水库施工的部队，保证在春汛前竣工，使二十万亩农田得到充分灌溉，争取增产粮食二千万斤。南京驻军某部支援紫金山下黄马水库将投入六万个工日。兰州部队专门派出几支部队，支援几个重点地区，穿山凿岭，开辟水库和水渠。派往商雒地区的部队，最近劈开了龙潭石峡上的绝壁，修通了龙潭水渠，从此免去了当地农民每年用于修坝的一万多个人工。
