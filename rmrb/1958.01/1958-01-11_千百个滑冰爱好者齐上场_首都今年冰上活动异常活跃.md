Thousands of Ice Skating Enthusiasts Take to the Ice
The Capital's Ice Activities Are Unusually Active This Year

    This newspaper reports that the ice skating season has arrived, and this year the capital's ice activities are particularly active.
    In addition to the five skating rinks that are open every year at Shichahai, Beihai, the Working People's Cultural Palace, Zhongshan Park, and Taoranting, a new skating rink has been opened this year in the Zizhuyuan Park in the western suburbs. In addition, the Beijing Children's Palace and the Children's Homes in Xisi, Dongsi, Xuanwu, and Dongdan districts have opened children's ice rinks behind the Forbidden City moat, Shichahai, Taoranting, and Lingjiaokeng outside Chaoyangmen, respectively, specifically for children and teenagers under the age of seventeen.
    In order to better serve ice sports enthusiasts, especially children, most skating rinks have opened children's skating areas, some skating rinks have prepared children's skates of various sizes, and some skating rinks have added lighting and ice sledges and other equipment.
    On the more than 120,000 square meters of ice in these skating rinks, five or six thousand workers, soldiers, cadres, students, and children are engaged in various activities every day. Shichahai and Beihai, the two largest skating rinks, alone receive two to three thousand ice sports enthusiasts every day. Even more people come to skate on Sundays. Especially lively are the Children's Palace ice rink, the Xisi District, Dongsi District children's ice rink, and the Xuanwu District children's ice rink, where the fees are low, and you can enter for only one cent, and you can borrow a pair of wooden skates. Therefore, more than a thousand children and teenagers, in classes and teams, go there every day for activities under the guidance of teachers or counselors.
    This year, many factories, government offices, and schools, in the spirit of diligence and thrift in running sports, have flooded their own ice rinks through voluntary labor and other methods. Doing so costs little, facilitates many skating enthusiasts, reduces the burden on public skating rinks, and gives more people the opportunity to participate in ice activities.

    千百个滑冰爱好者齐上场
    首都今年冰上活动异常活跃
    本报讯　滑冰的季节来到了，今年首都的冰上活动显得格外活跃。
    除去每年都开放的什刹海、北海、劳动人民文化宫、中山公园和陶然亭的五个滑冰场外，今年西郊紫竹院公园又新辟了一个滑冰场。另外，北京市少年宫和西四区、东四区、宣武区、东单区的少年之家分别在故宫后面护城河、什刹海、陶然亭和朝阳门外菱角坑等处开辟了儿童冰场，专供十七岁以下的儿童和少年活动。
    为了更好地为冰上运动爱好者，特别是儿童们服务，大多数冰场开辟了儿童滑冰区，有的冰场还准备了各种尺码的儿童冰鞋，有的冰场还增添了灯光和冰车等设备。
    在这些滑冰场的十二万多平方公尺的冰面上，每天都有五、六千工人、战士、机关干部、学生和儿童在进行各种活动。光什刹海和北海这两个面积最大的滑冰场，每天就接待二三千个冰上运动爱好者。每逢星期日来滑冰的人更多。特别热闹的是少年宫冰场、西四区、东四区儿童冰场和宣武区儿童冰场，那里收费低廉，花一分钱就可以进去滑冰，而且可以借一双木板冰鞋。因此每天总有一千多个儿童和少年成班成队地在教师或辅导员的带领下到那里活动。
    今年，不少工厂、机关、学校本着勤俭办体育事业的精神，用义务劳动等办法，自己泼了冰场。这样做花钱不多，便利了很多的溜冰爱好者，减轻了公共滑冰场的负担，使更多的人有机会参加冰上活动。
