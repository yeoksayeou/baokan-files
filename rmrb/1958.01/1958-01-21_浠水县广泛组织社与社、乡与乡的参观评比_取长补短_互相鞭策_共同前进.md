Xishui County, Hubei, from December 25th to January 5th, successively launched mass visits and comparison campaigns between cooperatives, townships, and groups, which greatly promoted the current production movement. The total number of visitors was more than 5,000, a great demonstration of enthusiasm. In addition to mutual visits, concentrated visits were also made to townships such as Zhudian, Zhuwa, and Yangci. The content of the visits and comparisons mainly focused on water conservancy construction, winter manure accumulation, and spring harvest cultivation.

Through visits and comparisons, the county, districts, townships, and cooperatives summarized typical examples, established benchmarks, and effectively overcame the right-leaning conservative thinking and complacency of some cadres. Chen Danti, the secretary of the Yangci Township Party Committee, originally thought that going to Tuanpo for a visit was unnecessary, complacently saying, "Our township's production can catch up with them even with my eyes closed." After visiting the Qunguang Cooperative in Tuanpo, he was shocked and admitted that he was lagging behind, deeply moved. Cadres of the Xuzui Cooperative in Bahe Township visited the Qunce Cooperative in Lanxi Township and saw that each household had a toilet. Comparing themselves, they said, "This area is also by the river, with few trees, and so is our area. We always say there is no wood and toilets cannot be built. Why can they build them here? Now we see that we lack determination and drive, and our thinking is too conservative." Wang Xichou, the captain of the Eighth Team of the Tian'e Cooperative in Xinpu Township, used to be unconvinced whenever the guidance group cadres introduced good production practices elsewhere, saying, "You cadres always say this place is good and that place is good, otherwise you wouldn't have any work to do." When the work team asked them to trim the field banks, he said, "How can we trim such high banks? Even gods can't do it." Therefore, he ignored it. This time, after visiting the Minzhu Cooperative in Guankou Township and seeing that others had built ladders to trim banks twice as high as theirs, he built ladders and trimmed several high banks.

Through visits and comparisons, the transformation of work styles of all cadres was promoted. Many cadres worked in the fields themselves, setting an example and demonstrating a noble revolutionary heroic spirit. District, township, cooperative, and team cadres from the Wanggang guidance group and all Party and League members took the lead in accumulating fertilizer, launching a "one person, one manure pile" campaign, completing more than 5,000 piles in ten days, and expressing their determination to win honor for this visit and comparison. Yang Daisheng, the accountant of the Xinjian Cooperative in Fuzhu Township, was described by the cooperative members as a "sitting accountant" (meaning he spent all day sitting in the office). When he heard that everyone should greet the visitors with practical actions, he also left the office and collected more than 800 catties of pig manure in ten days. The cooperative members said, "Since the visit news came, our sitting accountant has become a good manure collector." Yang Chanxiu, the captain of the First Team of the Qunguang Cooperative in Tuanpo Township, braved the icy water to retrieve soaked bucket lids from the pond to build toilets in order to welcome the visitors.

This visit and comparison also examined the reasons for the backwardness of backward cooperatives and teams, prompting the backward to catch up with the advanced and encouraging the advanced to strive for greater progress. A huge high tide of "catching up" emerged throughout the county. During the visits and comparisons, the Caihe guidance group mutually carried out "eight inspections" (water conservancy, fertilizer, spring harvest cultivation, afforestation, elimination of the four pests, distribution decisions, diversified operations, and the production enthusiasm of cooperative members) and "four comparisons" (comparing plans, comparing quantity, comparing quality, comparing mobilization). During the comparison, everyone criticized the Guoqiao Cooperative in Caihe Township for "three no actions, two high tides" (i.e., no action on water conservancy, fertilizer, and spring harvest cultivation, but a high tide of making 'danggāo' [sweet rice cakes] in preparation for the New Year and a high tide of grinding tofu to eat). This criticism aroused the attention of the Township Party Committee, which analyzed that the reason was the weak leadership core, superficial socialist education, and unclear lines between right and wrong among the masses. Therefore, two township cadres were immediately dispatched to strengthen the leadership, deeply mobilize the masses, organize visits to advanced places, and widely carry out debates among the cooperative members. The enthusiasm of the masses quickly surged, and all 300-plus laborers in the cooperative expressed their determination to "catch up with the advanced." More than 700 mu of spring harvest crops throughout the cooperative have been hoed once and fertilized once. Manure accumulation is now being carried out vigorously.

Encouraged by the visits and comparisons, the winter production high tide throughout the county has been pushed to a new stage. The vast masses are in high spirits, and progress is rapid. As of the 3rd, of the 460 million dan of fertilizer planned for the county, 43.6% had been completed; more than 530,000 mu of spring harvest crops had been hoed once, and more than 360,000 mu had been fertilized, accounting for 67.7%. More than 70% of the more than 86,000 mu of third-class seedlings had been additionally fertilized and covered with soil; and 376 cooperatives (accounting for 47.2% of the total number of cooperatives) had established a field management responsibility system. 44.6% of the more than 25 million cubic meters of water conservancy tasks had been completed. 48.2% of the more than 100,600 mu of soil improvement plans had been completed. More than 36,000 mu of the more than 50,000 mu of afforestation plans had been completed. The enthusiasm of the masses is getting stronger and stronger, and the mood is getting higher and higher. The captains of the Tian'e Cooperative in the Xinpu guidance group, after visiting Guankou, Yangci, and Zhudian, jointly wrote a song that says: "Entering Guankou, Yangci, and Zhudian townships, cooperative members are busy accumulating fertilizer, fields and cellars are filled with manure piles, and every bank is trimmed; the ridges are prepared as if for transplanting rice, why don't the frogs come out of their dens; it's not the season yet, but it's a good model for production; five constructions bring a new look, bamboos and trees have grown into forests; one pond connects to another, ditches are ten miles long, water is drawn and released straight away, no need to worry about a thousand catties per mu; the walls are covered with big-character posters, everyone is overjoyed." Not only were the fields and banks trimmed in the No. 2 Bee Cooperative in Bahe Township, but the roadsides were also trimmed. The ridges were not only raised, but also completely plowed, raked, and chiseled. Representatives from Lanxi Township said after the visit: "You won't get your feet wet walking in the morning in the No. 2 Bee Cooperative (meaning the grass on the roadside is gone, there is no dew), the No. 2 Bee Cooperative is not winter, but the weather in the third month of spring, now it's just time to transplant rice (meaning the fields are prepared)."

    浠水县广泛组织社与社、乡与乡的参观评比
    取长补短　互相鞭策　共同前进
    本报讯　湖北浠水县从上月25日到本月5日，先后开展了社与社、乡与乡、组与组群众性的参观评比运动，对当前生产运动起了很大推动作用。参观人数共约五千多人，声势很大。除了相互参观之外，还集中参观了朱店、竹瓦、杨祠等乡。参观评比内容主要是兴修水利、冬季积肥和培育春收。
    通过参观评比，县、区、乡、社总结了典型，树立了旗帜，有力地克服了部分干部的右倾保守思想和自满松气情绪。杨祠乡党委书记陈丹梯原来听说要到团陂去参观，很自满地说：“我这个乡的生产闭住眼睛也赶得上他们。”到团陂参观了群光社后，他才大吃一惊承认自己落后了，深受感动。巴河乡许咀社的干部参观兰溪乡群策社一户一个厕所后，对照自己说：“这里也是滨江区，树木少，我们那里也是滨江区，总喊没有木材，厕所搞不起来，为什么这里搞起来了呢？现在才看到是我们没有决心，没有干劲，思想太保守了。”新铺乡天鹅社八队队长汪习俦，过去一听指导组干部介绍别处生产搞的好，他总不服气地说：“你们当干部的总是在这里说那里好，不然那有工作做。”工作组的同志叫他们括田岸，他说：“这么高的岸要括，神本事也难。”因此一直不理。这次到关口乡民主社参观，看到人家比他们的岸高两倍都搭梯括光了，回来后就搭梯把几条高岸括光了。
    通过参观评比，推动了全体干部转变作风。很多干部脱脚下田，做出榜样，表现了高尚的革命英雄气概。汪岗指导组的区、乡、社、队下放干部和全体党团员带头积肥，开展了一人一壋积肥运动，十天内完成了五千多壋，表示要为这次参观评比争光。福主乡新建社会计杨代胜，过去社员形容他说：“我社的会计是坐记。”（意思是整天坐办公室）。这次他听说人人要以实际行动迎接参观者，也走出了办公室，十来天检了八百多斤猪粪，社员们说：“参观消息一来，我社的坐记变成了一个检粪的好社员。”团陂乡群光社第一队队长杨禅修，为了迎接参观，冒着冰冻的水下塘捞起浸了的桶子盖厕所。
    这次参观评比，还对照检查了落后社、落后队的原因，促使落后赶先进，推动先进争取更先进。全县出现了巨大的“赶”的高潮。蔡河指导组在参观评比中，互相开展了“八查”（水利、肥料、培育春收、造林、消灭四害、决分、多种经营结合、社员生产积极性）、“四比”（比规划、比数量、比质量、比发动）。评比中大家批评蔡河乡国桥社是“三没行动、两大高潮”（即水利、肥料、培育春收没行动，荡豆糕准备过年高潮、磨豆腐吃的高潮），这一批评引起了乡党委的重视，分析其原因是领导核心不强，社会主义教育走了过场，群众中是非界线不清。因此，立即派两个乡干部去加强领导力量，通过深入发动群众，组织到先进地方参观，又在社员中广泛开展辩论，群众的情绪很快高涨起来，全社三百多个劳动力，个个表示要“赶上先进”，全社七百多亩春收已普遍锄完一遍，上了一次粪。现在大搞积肥。新铺乡到关口民主社参观后，表扬了他们积肥搞的好，但春收作物却很不平衡。社干和社员们接受这个正确意见，抢抓消灭三类苗。目前，全社一百九十多亩三类苗已普遍加追一次肥和压了一次土粪。
    在参观评比的鼓舞下，全县冬季生产高潮推向了一个新的阶段。广大群众情绪高涨，进度很快。到3日止，全县计划积肥四亿六千万担，已经完成43.6％；五十三万多亩春收作物已普遍锄了一次，已追肥三十六万多亩，占67.7％，三类苗八万六千多亩，已有70％以上加了工；并有三百七十六个社（占总社数47.2％）建立了田间管理责任制。二千五百多万个土方的水利任务已完成了44.6％。十万零六千多亩土壤改良计划，完成了48.2％。五万多亩植树造林计划，已完成三万六千多亩。群众劲头越来越猛，情绪愈来愈高。新铺指导组天鹅社的队长们参观关口、杨祠、朱店后，共同作的歌谣说：“一进关口、杨祠、朱店乡，社员积肥忙，丘丘田窖壋，条条岸括光；垅田搞的像插秧样，青蛙为啥不出房；不是季节到，生产好榜样；五建一番新，竹树已成林；一塘连一塘，沟渠十里长，抽剅水直放，亩产千斤不用慌；墙墙贴的大字报，人人喜洋洋。”巴河乡蜜蜂二社不仅田地岸括光了，路边也括光了，垅田不仅起了坂，而且全部耙完、钞完、錾完。兰溪乡的代表参观后说：“蜜蜂二社清早走路打不湿脚（意思是路边草光了没有露水），蜜蜂二社不是冬天，是春三月的天气，现在只要插秧了（意思是田盘光了）。”
