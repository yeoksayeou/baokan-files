Strengthen Field Management After Winter Irrigation

In order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1958, northern provinces, while vigorously constructing farmland water conservancy projects, actively carried out winter irrigation work. According to incomplete statistics from Hebei, Shandong, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi and other provinces and regions as of the end of December 1957, the winter irrigation area has reached more than 50 million mu; Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Gansu, Shandong and other provinces and regions started winter irrigation work earlier and better; Inner Mongolia and Gansu have basically completed their winter irrigation plans.

The masses in many areas have great enthusiasm for winter irrigation, but many areas lack winter irrigation experience.

What should be paid attention to after winter irrigation? What work should be done after irrigation? These are relatively unfamiliar matters for some areas.

According to the experience of various places in winter irrigation over the past few years, wheat fields and bare land that have been winter irrigated should undergo certain field management. For wheat fields that were not fertilized before winter irrigation, topdressing should be carried out in time after irrigation. Topdressing should be carried out when the irrigation water has seeped down and the ground surface is slightly dry (about five to seven days after irrigation). Attention should also be paid to even application of fertilizer.

Some wheat fields develop hard crusts and cracks on the surface after irrigation, which is caused by excessive use of water. For such wheat fields, some floating soil should be sprinkled to fill the cracks, or the land should be harrowed to loosen the soil to retain moisture and prevent freezing. If it is found that the surface soil subsides after irrigation, forming suspended roots and exposed roots, slight rolling can be adopted, using a stone roller to roll it once, and break up the large soil clods in the field. Shallow hoeing once before freezing can play a role in cultivating soil and preserving moisture; this method can also be used for wheat fields where the ground surface is air-dried after irrigation.

If the irrigation time is too late, the wheat field may freeze after irrigation, forming a layer of floating ice on the ground surface. Attention should be paid to harrowing and grinding such wheat fields when thawing in early spring.

Although the suitable time for winter irrigation has basically passed, some areas are still continuing this work. During this stage of winter irrigation, attention should be paid to changes in temperature. If the weather is cold and the daytime temperature is around zero degrees Celsius and the nighttime temperature is below zero degrees Celsius, irrigation should not be carried out. If the daytime temperature is still high, but there is a possibility of freezing at any time, irrigation should be stopped at night as much as possible during the day, and special attention should be paid to the management and maintenance of canals and buildings to avoid freezing damage. In this case, the amount of water used for irrigation should be strictly controlled, and the quota should be small to prevent floating water and ice from lifting the wheat seedlings.

### 冬灌以后要加强田间管理

    冬灌以后要加强田间管理
    为了争取1958年的农业大丰收，北方各省在大规模兴修农田水利的同时，积极开展了冬灌工作。据河北、山东、内蒙古、甘肃、山西、河南、陕西等省区截至1957年12月底的不完全统计，冬灌面积已达五千多万亩；内蒙古、河北、甘肃、山东等省区冬灌工作开展的较早较好；内蒙古、甘肃已基本上完成了冬灌计划任务。
    许多地区的群众冬灌劲头很大，但是，不少地区都有缺乏冬灌经验的情况。
    冬灌后应注意什么？灌溉以后应该作些什么工作？对有些地区说来也都是比较生疏的事情。
    根据几年来各地冬灌的经验，冬灌过的小麦和白地都应当进行一定的田间管理。对冬灌前没有施肥的麦田，要在灌后及时追肥。追肥应在灌水下渗、地表稍干的时候（约在灌后五天到七天）进行。施肥还要注意施的均匀。
    有些麦地浇后地表出现硬壳和裂缝，这是用水过量所造成的。对这样的麦地，应该撒些浮土弥缝或耙地松土以保墒防冻。如果发现灌后表土下沉，形成吊根、露根现象，可以采取轻微镇压办法，用石碾子碾一遍，并打碎地里的大土块。在结冻前浅锄一次，可以起培土保墒作用；对灌后地表风干的麦田也可以采用这种办法。
    灌溉时间过晚，麦田可能在灌后上冻，地表形成浮冰层。对这样的麦田要注意在初春消冻的时候进行耙磨。
    冬灌的适宜时间虽然基本上过去了，但是部分地区还在继续进行这个工作。在这个阶段冬灌应该注意气温的变化，如果天气已寒冷到白天气温在零度左右，夜间在零度以下的情况下，就不宜灌水了。如果白天气温还高，但随时有封冻可能，就得尽量昼灌夜停，并应特别注意渠道和建筑物的管理养护，以免冻坏。在这种情况下，灌溉的用水量要严加控制，定额宜小，以防浮水冰冻，掀起麦苗。
