Xinhua News Agency, 19th: At the 18th Enlarged Meeting of the Party Committee of Central State Organs held on the 18th, Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, summarized the current situation of the rectification movement in central state organs and put forward future tasks. Xi Zhongxun called on cadres of central state organs to further launch an upsurge of in-depth rectification with a revolutionary spirit and strive for a complete victory in the rectification movement.

Xi Zhongxun said that this enlarged meeting of the Party Committee is a promotion meeting, and we will all promote the rectification movement. The achievements of the central state organs in general rectification are enormous. Now, the upsurge of general rectification has basically passed, and we must immediately move forward, carry out special topic airing of views, special topic debates, and special topic rectification, and with a revolutionary spirit, launch an upsurge of in-depth rectification. This is the central task of the current rectification movement.

	After General Rectification, Leadership Style Improves, Inspiring Revolutionary Drive, Preventing an Abrupt End
Xi Zhongxun said that the central state organs did not enter the general rectification for a very long time (about two months), and the tens of thousands of opinions raised by the masses have basically been resolved. From this, we can see that the issues raised by the masses were so extensive that many corners that had never been swept were swept, many unheard-of problems were exposed, and some problems that had not been resolved for many years were quickly and largely resolved. After general rectification, not only were the "sesame seeds" almost picked up, but more importantly, the leadership style has changed greatly. In the past, the tendency to often handle affairs behind closed doors, not contacting the masses, not connecting with reality, and neglecting politics, has begun to improve; at the same time, they have come into contact with reality, seen the wisdom of the masses, broadened their horizons, and found more methods. These improvements in leadership style have also stimulated the political enthusiasm of the masses, improved work efficiency, and a new situation in political life has begun to appear in some organs. Xi Zhongxun said that this should be regarded as a new victory in the socialist revolution in politics and ideology.

However, he said, the achievements of general rectification are only preliminary victories, and more arduous tasks are still ahead. If we are only satisfied with the achievements of general rectification, it will make the rectification movement stagnate. If we do not muster revolutionary drive to persist, we cannot harvest big watermelons and solve big problems. Therefore, we must especially prevent relaxation and prevent abrupt ends and anticlimaxes.

At the same time, it must also be seen that the general rectification work of various units is still uneven. The leadership of some units is not determined enough, and the problems are not solved deeply and thoroughly, and the masses still have opinions; some rectifications are of poor quality and do not hit the key points; some do not combine with the objective reality of the rectification movement, take detours, and postpone the general rectification; in particular, some units are complacent, believing that the rectification has achieved so much and that bureaucracy has been opposed "almost enough," forgetting in-depth rectification, and believing that the rectification movement can be ended; some also use the excuse of being busy with work, saying that the rectification has been going on for more than half a year, and request to end the rectification and focus on business. These practices and ideas are wrong and must be corrected.

Xi Zhongxun said that the task of the revolution lies in solving one problem and then raising a new problem. We must ride the wind and waves and continue to move forward. General rectification is to clear the way and prepare conditions for in-depth rectification, so as to continue to advance and lead the rectification movement in depth. The main experiences since the rectification:
	1. The leadership is determined and not afraid of getting burned.
	2. The mass line and mass work methods
	3. Party leadership stands at the forefront of the movement
	4. Distinguish between the size of the problems, solve them step by step from easy to difficult
	5. Grasp typical examples and seize the advanced experiences created in the mass movement

Xi Zhongxun then talked about some of the main experiences gained by the central state organs since the rectification:

First, the great determination of the leadership is a prerequisite for ensuring the victory of the rectification. Wherever the determination is great, there will be a revolutionary drive, not afraid of getting burned. The more the fire can be burned, and not afraid of burning oneself, the more the bad things will be burned away, and the greater the achievements made.

Second, the mass line and mass work methods are an important guarantee for the victory of the rectification. Facts have proved that the vast majority of the masses can be trusted and relied upon; as long as we can resolutely rely on the masses, every step of the rectification will form a mass movement. In the movement, the leaders are both students and teachers. The masses educate the leaders, and the leaders also educate the masses. Mastering this method enables our leading cadres to gradually learn and master the new socialist forms of democracy of airing views freely, debating thoroughly, and using big-character posters, and to realize that the working method of the mass line is indeed a good method for resolving contradictions among the people.

Third, the leadership of the Party must stand at the forefront of the movement, grasp the laws of the development of the movement, in order to guide the movement forward. In the mass movement, the task of the leaders is to understand the situation, understand the emotions of the masses, point out the direction, and actively arrange each step; at the same time, according to the development of the movement, grasp the laws, guide the movement forward according to circumstances. Only by standing at the forefront of the movement can we actively take steps, grasp a problem, understand it thoroughly, and alternately connect it without confusing the steps, and advance rhythmically, so as to strengthen leadership.

Fourth, in the rectification, we must distinguish between the size of the problems, and solve them step by step according to the principle of easy first and difficult later, to gain experience. In solving problems, we must neither disregard the demands and interests of the masses, abandon the general small problems, and stubbornly tackle the big problems, nor stop the movement at the stage of general rectification, and forcibly push the big problems that can be solved to later. In the in-depth rectification stage, there will still be many small problems. This requires us to be good at solving many small problems that the masses are concerned about while solving a big problem. Small problems often occur in the work. The purpose of general rectification is not only to solve piles of small problems, but more importantly, to overcome ideological laziness and learn to be good at discovering and solving problems.

Fifth, to lead the mass movement, we must learn to grasp typical examples and seize the advanced experiences created in the mass movement. There are two types of typical examples, advanced and backward, and both types of typical examples have guiding significance. The leadership should be good at timely absorbing the experience of advanced units, summarizing and promoting them, encouraging the advanced, helping the backward, and constantly making the movement develop from an unbalanced state to a roughly balanced state, making the advanced more advanced, and making the backward learn lessons, and also master advanced methods to catch up.

	In-depth Rectification is More Complicated than General Rectification
	We Must Grasp the Link of In-depth Debate

Xi Zhongxun said that these experiences are good, but the experiences in general rectification cannot be completely regarded as the experiences in in-depth rectification. Any experience has its limitations. We must use the methods of Marxism-Leninism to create new experiences adapted to the new environment and new situations. Leadership is an art, neither being the tail of the masses, nor running too fast and being divorced from the masses. If we understand this, we will make fewer mistakes of subjectivism and carry out the rectification movement creatively. Xi Zhongxun then focused on the issue of in-depth debate and in-depth rectification. He said that there are many problems and heavy tasks in in-depth rectification, which are more complicated than airing views freely and general rectification. In-depth rectification includes sending cadres to lower levels, handling rightists, the anti-waste movement, reforming the system and various rules and regulations, reducing the size of the staff, adjusting the structure, business guidelines and policies, improving Party-masses relations, improving leadership style, as well as carrying out ideological criticism, and handling law-breaking and discipline-violating bad elements, and so on. How to arrange these heavy and complex tasks is a big problem. But one basic link must be grasped, and that is in-depth debate.

How to debate well? We still lack experience. To debate well, we must compare the various opinions expressed by the masses, including the correct, not completely correct, wrong, and not completely wrong, and we must have ideological exchanges, and concentrate the correct parts of the various opinions, in order to obtain a perfect improvement plan, in order to carry out serious rectification. Therefore, if the debate is not deep and thorough, it is better to continue the in-depth debate than to easily carry out rectification. We must realize that without full and large-scale debates, it is impossible to solve problems from the root of thought, and it is impossible to implement profound socialist ideological education.

Of course, not every topic must go through debate, otherwise it will become formalism, arguing everywhere, arguing about everything, arguing all day long, which is not a good way. But issues such as sending cadres to lower levels, handling rightists, and opposing waste must go through mass debates.

Organizing large-scale debates must prevent generalized discussions that deviate from the actual situation of the agency. We can grasp key issues to guide the debate, or we can turn from general issues to a central issue for in-depth debate. The methods can be used flexibly. However, large-scale debates must be raised to ideological principles, and concentrate efforts to fire on the three isms. Bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism are our root causes of disease, and the shortcomings and errors revealed by the masses all belong to this aspect.

	Change the Face of the Organs Through the Movement
	Everyone Considers Passing the Socialist Test

Xi Zhongxun emphasized that the vast majority of our Party member leading cadres in central state organs are good, but in some leading organs and leading cadres, there are indeed quite serious problems of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism; some people have an unclear understanding of the current revolutionary situation, lack ideological preparation for the leap-forward development and changes of the socialist revolution, and have various right-leaning thoughts; even a few people have been corrupted by bourgeois ideology and have degenerated into rightists. We must have sufficient estimates and attention to these situations. We must continue to mobilize the whole Party to stand at the forefront of the revolutionary situation, seize this favorable opportunity, and make the in-depth rectification deep and thorough, and vigorously overcome the bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism in leadership; strengthen socialist education for cadres and improve ideological awareness. We demand to change the entire face of the central state organs through this movement, so that all aspects such as leadership style, working methods, and ideological awareness will be changed, and a new atmosphere will emerge, creating a new political situation. We demand that everyone use this revolutionary socialist standard to measure themselves, demand themselves, and transform themselves. The revolutionary situation is advancing by leaps and bounds. If in such a big storm, some people have not been impacted and have not changed, this is not a good thing but a bad thing, and it is worthy of great vigilance. We should think about what is preventing us from moving forward? Are we determined to fight against things that hinder progress? These are all worth considering carefully by everyone. Otherwise, there is a danger of not passing the socialist test well.

	Follow the Mass Line and Learn from the Masses
	Get Rid of Official Air and Eliminate Senility

Xi Zhongxun said that the ideological roots of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism, strictly speaking, are the lack of a clear view of serving the people and a serious and responsible attitude towards the Party and the people. People with bureaucratic style are full of "official air," domineering, handle affairs without following the mass line, do not learn from the masses, and use the method of suppression more and the method of persuasion less. The main danger of this bureaucratic style is that it is divorced from reality and the masses. We must oppose bureaucracy, get rid of official air, and eliminate senility. Because senile bureaucracy cannot build socialism well. It can only corrode our revolutionary will and disperse our revolutionary drive. People with subjectivist style do not proceed from objective reality, but only from subjective imagination. Its main danger is that it makes us unable to correctly formulate and implement the Party's policies, and makes us make "left" or right deviations and errors in our work. At present, it is mainly manifested as the right-leaning conservative thinking that the leadership lags behind the masses and the thinking lags behind reality. For our socialist construction, it only sees shortcomings, not achievements, and regards the revolutionary leap forward as blind adventurism; in terms of class struggle, it loses vigilance against bad elements who sabotage the socialist cause, and shows numbness to the unhealthy trends and counter-currents against socialism. Sectarianism is a manifestation of subjectivism in organizational relations. Sectarianism within the Party is to destroy the Party's unity; outside the Party, it is to destroy the unity between the Party and the people of the whole country. It is closely related to the phenomena of disregarding the overall interests, emphasizing special interests, not obeying the Party's unified leadership, departmentalism, localism, and disunity of the leading group.

	Any Shortcomings and Errors Cannot Be Hidden
	If You Are Lucky Enough to Hide Them, They Will Eventually Be Exposed

Xi Zhongxun said that in in-depth rectification, we must focus on the rectification of leading cadres, especially leading cadres above the level of division chief and bureau chief must not miss this lesson, and they should be required to rectify better and more thoroughly than ordinary cadres, so that it will be conducive to the development of in-depth rectification and help the future leadership work. Without the determination of leading cadres, without personally taking action, without creating an active democratic atmosphere, the masses are not easy to mobilize; without creating the momentum of the masses and the pressure of public opinion, errors and shortcomings cannot be reversed.

Xi Zhongxun emphasized that it is necessary to mention again that some of our comrades are afraid of getting burned, which is wrong. Any shortcomings and errors cannot be hidden. If you do not correct your shortcomings and errors, life will not be easy. Even if you are lucky enough to hide your shortcomings and errors, they will become more serious as they develop, and will eventually be exposed. Therefore, we must have a revolutionary drive, make up our minds, ignite the fire of rectification, and burn away our shortcomings and errors. In the central state organs, some comrades with shortcomings and errors have two attitudes towards their own problems: one is to dare to expose and be brave to correct them, which is not dangerous. The other is not dare to expose their shortcomings and errors, and are unwilling to be exposed by others, nor are they willing to actively correct them. People with this attitude have potential dangers. Although the fire of this rectification may not burn him, it will inevitably make him lag behind in the future.

	Solve Contradictions Among the People
	Correctly Grasp the Methods of Handling

Xi Zhongxun said that, of course, the struggle against bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism ultimately belongs to the contradictions among the people. We must recognize this clearly in in-depth debate. In addition to a part of the contradictions among the people that belong to the reflection of the ideological consciousness of the exploiting classes, that is, the reflection of the ideological struggle between socialism and capitalism in the transitional period, they all belong to the contradictions between the leader and the led, between the Party and the masses, between this part and that part, or the contradiction that understanding lags behind reality. For the contradictions reflected by the ideological consciousness and style of the exploiting classes, we must use the socialist ideological weapon to defeat capitalist ideology. This struggle is sometimes more acute. However, since these problems basically belong to the contradictions among the people, and are struggles on the ideological front, the method of overcoming these contradictions must be the method of handling contradictions among the people, that is, the gentle and kind method. When launching in-depth debates, we must grasp the spirit of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the disease to save the patient." The leadership must humbly accept the correct opinions and the correct parts of the opinions raised by the masses, and earnestly correct them. For incorrect opinions, as long as they belong to the problems among the people, we must also patiently explain them, or seek solutions through debate. Correctly grasping the methods of handling these contradictions will enable us to maintain a clear mind in the face of the task of in-depth rectification, so as to achieve greater victories in this crucial stage of the rectification movement.

	First Launch an Upsurge Against Waste
	Implement the Policy of Building the Country Through Thrift and Hard Work

Xi Zhongxun then talked about launching an upsurge against waste in in-depth rectification. In socialist construction, should we be diligent, thrifty, simple, and work hard, or should we be extravagant and wasteful and squander at will? These all need to be thoroughly debated ideologically. In our central state organs, whether it is the industrial sector, the cultural and educational sector, or other sectors, all departments that control national construction funds and administrative expenses must have phenomena of waste. If this phenomenon is not debated clearly ideologically and a fundamental solution is sought, it will affect the speed of national construction, and the policy of building the country through thrift and hard work and more, faster, better, and more economical proposed by the Party Central Committee will be in danger of being difficult to realize. Therefore, it is very necessary to immediately carry out a special debate and special rectification centered on anti-waste after entering in-depth rectification.

Xi Zhongxun talked about the issue of sending cadres to lower levels to participate in labor training. He believes that most cadres now have a correct understanding of the revolutionary significance of this policy. The political quality of the first batch of cadres sent to lower levels is very good, the ideological concerns of the cadres have been eliminated, and the understanding has been greatly improved. The vast majority of cadres who have been sent to the countryside have performed very well. They have not only actively participated in labor, but also helped the countryside to do a lot of work, and encouraged the masses. The broad masses welcome them. Therefore, the correct ideas such as labor is glorious, training is necessary, and sending cadres to lower levels has great prospects have prevailed. However, this work should also pay attention to the following issues: First, the objects of sending cadres to lower levels in various agencies should consider the cadres of administrative agencies and institutions together; second, do not wait for the final decision on the organizational structure before sending them to lower levels, nor should you use the excuse that the establishment has not been determined not to send them to lower levels; third, the first batch should send as many cadres as possible to lower levels, do not be afraid of taking risks; fourth, we must launch a large-scale debate and educate cadres through debate.

Xi Zhongxun also talked about the issue of handling rightists and ensuring that both rectification and work are not delayed. Regarding how to arrange rectification and work, he said that the business work of some agencies is relatively busy, but as long as it is arranged well, it will not delay the work. At the same time, we must also understand that if the work is delayed, it can be made up for, but if the rectification is delayed, it will delay the solution of ideological problems, and the problem will be very big. Therefore, as long as the leaders of each unit have a good arrangement for rectification and work, and conduct it in close combination, and arrange business work through rectification, the business work will be done better.

Finally, Xi Zhongxun said that we must make full use of the opportunity of rectification, and we must be good at using it to solve some fundamental problems and problems that cannot be solved in normal times in the socialist ideological revolution. Therefore, all agencies must seize the time (of course, it is not limited by time), seize the favorable opportunity, and launch an upsurge of in-depth rectification.

    鼓起革命劲头　掀起深入整改高潮
    习仲勋总结中央国家机关当前整风运动情况
    新华社19日讯　在18日举行的中央国家机关党委第18次扩大会议上，国务院秘书长习仲勋在会上总结了当前中央国家机关整风运动的情况，提出了今后的任务，习仲勋号召中央国家机关的干部，要以革命的精神，进一步掀起深入整改的高潮，争取整风运动的全胜。
    习仲勋说，这次党委扩大会议是一次促进会，我们大家都来把整风运动促进一下。中央国家机关在一般整改中获得的成绩是巨大的，现在，一般整改的高潮基本上已经过去，必须立即前进一步，开展专题鸣放、专题辩论、专题整改，用革命的劲头，掀起一个深入整改的高潮，这就是当前整风运动的中心任务。
    经过一般整改　领导作风改进鼓起革命干劲　防止有始无终
    习仲勋说，中央国家机关进入一般整改的时间并不很长（约两个多月），群众提出的成千成万条意见都基本上得到了解决。从这里可以看到，群众鸣放的问题是那样广泛，许多从来没有扫到的角落被扫到了，许多闻所未闻的问题被揭发出来，一些长年累月不得解决的问题，迅速大量地解决了。经过一般整改，不仅“芝麻”问题拣得差不多了，更重要的是领导作风有了很大改变。过去常常习惯于关着门办事，不联系群众、不联系实际和忽视政治的倾向，开始有所改进；同时他们接触到了实际，看到了群众的智慧，眼界开阔了，办法也多了。领导作风的这些改进，也就激发了群众的政治热情，提高了工作效率，在一些机关里开始出现了政治生活的新局面。习仲勋说，应该认为，这是政治上和思想上社会主义革命的一次新的胜利。
    但是，他说，一般整改的成绩只是初步的胜利，更艰巨的任务还在后边。如果只满足于一般整改的成绩，就会使整风运动停滞不前，不鼓起革命干劲坚持下去，就不能抱大西瓜，不能解决大问题。因此，当前要特别防止松懈，防止有始无终、虎头蛇尾。
    同时还必须看到，各个单位一般整改工作进行的还不平衡，有的单位领导决心不够大，解决问题不深不透，群众还有意见；有的整改质量不高，击不中要害；有的不结合整风运动的客观实际，走了弯路，推迟了一般整改；特别是有的单位有自满情绪，认为整改成绩这么大，官僚主义反的“差不多了”，忘记深入整改，认为整风运动可以结束了；有的并且借口业务繁忙，说整风已半年多，要求结束整风专搞业务。这些作法和想法都是错误的，必须纠正。
    习仲勋说，革命的任务，就在于解决一个问题再提出一个新的问题，必须乘风破浪，不断向前推进。一般整改就是为深入整改扫清道路，准备条件，以便继续前进，把整风运动引向深入。整改以来的主要经验：
    一、领导决心大，不怕引火烧身
    二、群众路线和群众工作方法
    三、党的领导站在运动前列
    四、分清问题大小，先易后难逐步解决
    五、抓典型，抓住群众运动中创造的先进经验
    习仲勋接着谈到中央国家机关在整改以来所取得的一些主要经验：
    第一、领导上的决心大，是保证整改胜利的先决条件。凡是决心大，就会出现一股革命的干劲，不怕引火烧身。能够把火烧得越大，而且不怕烧到自己身上，这样坚决做了的单位，坏东西也就烧掉的越多，做出的成绩也就越大。
    第二、群众路线和群众工作方法是整改胜利的重要保证。事实证明，绝大多数群众是可以相信的，可以依靠的；只要能够坚决依靠群众，整风的每一步骤都会形成群众运动。在运动中，领导人又当学生又当先生，群众教育了领导，领导也教育了群众。掌握了这个方法，就使我们领导干部逐步地学会和掌握了大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报的社会主义民主新形式，体会到群众路线的工作方法确实是解决人民内部矛盾的好方法。
    第三、党的领导必须站在运动前列，掌握运动发展的规律，才能引导运动前进。在群众运动中，领导者的任务就是要洞察情况，了解群众情绪，指明方向，主动地安排每个步骤；同时要根据运动的发展，掌握规律，因势利导，指导运动前进。只有站在运动前列，才能主动地摆开步子，抓住一个问题，搞透一个问题，并且交错衔接，又不混乱步伐，有节奏地前进，这样才能加强领导。
    第四、在整改中要分清问题的大小，按照先易后难逐步解决问题，取得经验。在解决问题中，既不要不顾群众的要求和兴趣，抛开一般小问题，硬啃大问题，也不要把运动停留在一般整改的阶段，把可以解决的大问题硬推到以后去解决。在深入整改阶段，也还会有不少小问题。这就需要我们善于在解决一个大问题的同时也解决很多群众所关心的小问题。小问题在工作中会经常发生，一般整改的目的，不仅是为了解决成堆的小问题，更重要的还在于克服思想上的懒惰，学会善于发现问题和解决问题。
    第五、领导群众运动，必须学会抓典型，抓住群众运动中创造出来的先进经验。典型有先进和落后的两种，两种典型都有指导意义。领导上要善于及时地吸取先进单位的经验，加以总结推广，鼓励先进，帮助落后，不断地使运动从不平衡状态达到大体平衡的发展，使先进的更加先进，使落后的吸取教训，也能掌握先进的方法，赶上前去。
  深入整改比一般整改更复杂
  必须抓住深入辩论这个环节
    习仲勋说，这些经验是好的，但是不能把一般整改中的经验完全当作深入整改的经验。任何经验都有一定的局限性。我们必须用马克思列宁主义的方法，去创造适应于新环境新情况下的新经验。领导就是艺术，既不能做群众的尾巴，又不能跑得太快，脱离群众，懂得了这一点，我们就会少犯主观主义的毛病，就会创造性地开展整风运动。习仲勋然后着重谈到深入辩论、深入整改的问题。他说，深入整改中问题很多，任务很重，比之大鸣大放、一般整改都要复杂。深入整改包括下放干部、处理右派、反浪费运动、改革体制和各种规章制度，紧缩编制，调整机构，业务方针政策问题，改进党群关系，改进领导作风以及开展思想批判，处理违法乱纪的坏分子等等。如何把这些繁重复杂的工作安排好，是个很大的问题。但是其中一个基本环节必须抓住，这就是深入辩论。
    如何辩论得好呢？我们还缺乏经验。要辩论得好，必须把群众鸣放出来的各种意见，其中包括正确的，不完全正确的，错误的，不完全错误的，都拿来进行一番比较，要思想交锋，把各种意见的正确部分集中起来，才能得出完善的改进方案，才能进行认真的整改。因此，辩论得不深不透，宁可继续深入辩论，也不要轻易进行整改。必须认识，没有充分的大辩论，就不可能从思想根子上解决问题，就不可能贯彻深刻的社会主义思想教育。
    当然，也并不是每个专题都必须经过辩论，否则也会变成形式主义，处处争论，事事争论，整天争论不休，也不是好办法。但是关于下放干部、处理右派、反对浪费等问题，就必须经过群众性的大辩论。
    组织大辩论必须防止离开本机关实际的泛泛而论。可以抓住关键性问题引导辩论，也可以从一般性问题转到一个中心问题深入辩论，方法可以灵活运用。但是，大辩论必须要提高到思想原则，集中力量向三个主义开火。官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义是我们的病根子，群众鸣放中所揭露出来的缺点和错误，其性质都属于这方面的东西。
    通过运动改变机关面貌
    人人考虑过社会主义关
    习仲勋强调指出，我们中央国家机关的党员领导干部绝大多数是好的，但是在某些领导机关和领导干部中，确实存在着相当严重的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义的毛病；有些人对当前的革命形势认识不清，对社会主义革命的飞跃发展和变化缺乏思想准备，存在着各种各样的右倾思想；甚至有少数人受到资产阶级思想的腐蚀，已经堕落成为右派。对于这些情况，我们必须有足够的估计和重视。我们必须继续深入动员全党站到革命形势的前面，抓住这个有利时机，把深入整改搞深搞透，大力克服领导上的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义；加强对干部的社会主义教育，提高思想觉悟。我们要求通过这个运动，改变中央国家机关的整个面貌，使领导作风、工作方法和思想意识等一切方面都有所改变，出现一个新的气象，造成一个新的政治局面。我们要求每个人都用这个革命的社会主义标准来衡量自己、要求自己、改造自己。革命的形势正在乘风破浪地前进，如果在这样大风浪里，有些人还没有受到冲击，还没有什么变化，这不是好事而是坏事，就值得大大警惕。应该想想，究竟是什么东西阻挡着自己前进？究竟有没有决心向阻碍前进的东西进行斗争？这些都值得每个人很好考虑。否则，社会主义这一关就有过不好的危险。
    走群众路线　向群众学习
    打掉官气　肃清暮气
    习仲勋说，官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义的思想根源严格地说就是缺乏明确的为人民服务的观点，对党对人民不是严肃负责的态度。有官僚主义作风的人，“官气”十足，盛气凌人，办事不走群众路线，不向群众学习，用压服的方法多，用说服的方法少。这种官僚主义作风的主要危险就在于脱离实际，脱离群众。我们必须反对官僚主义，必须打掉官气，肃清暮气。因为暮气沉沉的官僚主义是不可能把社会主义建设好的，它只能腐蚀我们的革命意志，涣散我们的革命干劲。有主观主义作风的人，不从客观存在的实际出发，只凭主观想像，它的主要危险是使我们不能正确地制定和执行党的政策，使我们在工作上发生“左”的或右的偏向和错误。它在目前主要表现是领导落后于群众，思想落后于实际的右倾保守思想。它对于我们的社会主义建设事业，只看缺点，不看成绩，把革命的跃进，当作盲目冒进；在阶级斗争方面，对于破坏社会主义事业的坏分子丧失警惕，对于反对社会主义的歪风逆流表现麻木不仁。而宗派主义是主观主义在组织关系上的一种表现，表现于党内的宗派主义，就是破坏党的团结；在党外，就是破坏党和全国人民的团结。它和那些不顾整体利益、强调特殊，不服从党的统一领导的本位主义、地方主义和领导集团不团结等现象，有密切联系。
  任何缺点错误都隐藏不住
  侥幸藏下来最终还会暴露
    习仲勋说，在深入整改中，要着重领导干部的整风，特别是司局长以上的领导干部不能误了这一课，而且还应该要求他们比一般干部整的更好，更彻底，这样才有利于深入整改的开展，有助于今后的领导工作。没有领导干部的决心，不亲自动手，不去造成活跃的民主空气，群众是不容易发动起来的；不造成群众的声势和舆论的压力，错误和缺点也是反不掉的。
    习仲勋强调说，有必要再提一下，我们有些同志不敢引火烧身，这是不对的。任何缺点和错误都是隐藏不住的，不改正缺点和错误，日子就不好过。即使侥幸地把缺点和错误隐藏下来，发展下去会更加严重，最终还是会暴露出来。因此，我们必须要有一股革命干劲，下定决心，燃起整风的烈火，烧掉缺点和错误。在中央国家机关有一些有缺点和错误的同志对待自己的问题有两种态度：一种是敢于揭发，勇于改正，这就没有危险。另一种是不敢暴露自己的缺点和错误，既不愿别人揭发，也不愿积极改正。有这种态度的人，就潜伏着危险。虽然在这次整风烈火中可能烧不到他，将来必然会使他落后。
    解决人民内部的矛盾
    要正确掌握处理方法
    习仲勋说，当然，反对官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义的斗争，终究是属于人民内部的矛盾，这一点，我们必须在深入辩论中认识清楚。人民内部矛盾除了有一部分是属于反映剥削阶级的思想意识，即过渡时期社会主义和资本主义之间的思想斗争的反映以外，都是属于领导和被领导之间、党和群众之间、这一部分和那一部分之间的矛盾，或认识落后于实际的矛盾。对于由剥削阶级意识作风所反映的矛盾，就必须用社会主义思想武器去战胜资本主义思想，这种斗争有时是比较尖锐的。但是，又由于这些问题基本上都是属于人民内部的矛盾，并且是在思想战线上的斗争，因此，克服这些矛盾的方法就必须是用处理人民内部矛盾的方法。即和风细雨的方法。在展开深入辩论时，必须掌握“惩前毖后、治病救人”的精神。领导上对于群众提出来的正确意见和意见中的正确部分，都必须虚心地接受，认真地改正。对于不正确的意见，只要是属于人民内部的问题，也要耐心地解释，或者通过辩论求得解决。正确地掌握处理这些矛盾的方法，使我们在深入整改的任务面前，保持清醒的头脑，以便在整风运动这一关键性的阶段取得更大的胜利。
  首先掀起反浪费的高潮
  贯彻执行勤俭建国方针
    习仲勋接着谈到，在深入整改中，要首先掀起一个反浪费的高潮。在社会主义建设中，是勤俭朴素艰苦奋斗呢？还是铺张浪费随意挥霍呢？这都需要从思想上进行深入的辩论。在我们中央国家机关，不论产业部门、文教部门或其他部门，凡是掌握国家建设资金和行政经费的所有各个部门，浪费的现象肯定是有的。这种现象如果不从思想上辩论清楚，求得根本的解决，就会影响国家建设的速度，就会使党中央提出的勤俭建国和多、快、好、省的方针有难以实现的危险。因此，在进入深入整改以后立即进行一个以反浪费为中心的专题辩论和专题整改，是十分必要的。
    习仲勋谈到关于下放干部参加劳动锻炼的问题。他认为现在多数干部对于这个政策的革命意义有了正确的认识。第一批下放干部的政治质量很好，干部中的思想顾虑消除了，认识大为提高。已经下放农村的干部，绝大多数表现都很好，他们不仅积极地参加劳动，并且帮助农村做了很多工作，鼓舞了群众，广大群众对他们是欢迎的。因此现在劳动光荣、锻炼必要、下放干部大有前途等正确思想已占上风。但是，这一工作还要注意以下几个问题：一，各机关下放干部的对象，要把行政机关和事业机关的干部一起加以考虑；二，不要等机构最后定案才下放，也不要借口编制未定而不下放；三，第一批应该尽可能多下放一些干部，不要害怕冒了出危险；四，要展开大辩论，通过辩论教育干部。
    习仲勋在会上还谈到处理右派和整风、工作两不误的问题。关于整风和工作如何安排问题，他说，有些机关业务工作比较忙，但只要安排得好，就不会延误工作。同时，也要了解，工作有了延误，可以弥补，误了整风，就会误了思想问题的解决，问题就很大，因此，只要各单位领导上对于整风和工作有很好的安排，紧密结合进行，通过整风安排业务工作，是会把业务工作做得更好的。
    最后，习仲勋说，我们要充分利用整风的时机，要善于利用在社会主义思想革命中解决一些带有根本性的问题和平时所不能解决的问题。因此，各机关要抢时间（当然也不为时间所限），抓紧有利时机，掀起一个深入整改的高潮。
