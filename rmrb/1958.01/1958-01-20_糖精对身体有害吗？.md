Is Saccharin Harmful to the Body?
    Hong Zhi

    Saccharin is now sold in small, unpackaged packets in the market. You can buy a packet weighing a little over one qian (approx. 0.11 oz) for a little over two jiao (approx. $0.03 USD). This small amount of saccharin can replace white sugar in making more than 40 jin (approx. 44 lbs) of cakes or more than 40 bottles of soda. Why is saccharin, which is 400 to 500 times sweeter than sugar, much cheaper than white sugar?

    Saccharin and sugar are two completely different things. Sugar is extracted from sugarcane and beets; while saccharin is refined and processed from coal tar. In terms of composition, sugar is formed by the combination of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms; while saccharin, in addition to containing carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms, also contains sulfur, nitrogen, and sodium atoms. Because coal tar is relatively easy to obtain and is not affected by crop harvests, the price of saccharin is also low.

    Many people prefer to spend a little more money to buy white sugar rather than buy the much cheaper saccharin because they are afraid that saccharin is harmful to the body. In fact, according to scientists' research, after a person consumes saccharin, it can generally be almost completely excreted from the body in the urine within 24 hours. In this way, saccharin will not have any impact on the body. Of course, eating too much will hinder normal digestive function. However, because saccharin is too sweet, only a very small amount is needed when using it; using too much will make it taste bitter. When making pastries with one jin (approx. 1.1 lbs) of flour, use at most one-quarter of a fen (0.07 grams) of saccharin; when making one liter of soda or other beverages, use at most half a fen (0.15 grams) of saccharin. Such a small amount of saccharin will not harm the human body.

    Saccharin is only used for flavoring and has no nutritional value for people. However, the nutritional value of sugar is also not very high. People who like sweet tastes eat at most two or three liang (approx. 2.5-3.5 oz) of white sugar a day. These two or three liang of white sugar can generate about 200-300 calories of heat. The grains we eat every day are rich in carbohydrates. The rice and flour we eat are made up of starch, which will be converted into a large amount of sugar. A two-and-a-half-liang (approx. 3 oz) steamed bun can be converted into more than one liang (approx. 1.7 oz) of sugar; a five-liang (approx. 7 oz)窩窩頭 (wō wō tóu, a type of corn bread) can also generate two and a half liang (approx. 3 oz) of sugar. If a person eats about one jin (approx. 1.1 lbs) of grain a day, they can get the nutrition of about ten liang (approx. 13 oz) of sugar. Therefore, even if you don't specifically eat those two or three liang of white sugar, you will not lack sugar nutrition.

### 糖精对身体有害吗？

    糖精对身体有害吗？
    鸿志
    市场上有了小纸包散装出售的糖精。花二角多钱就可以买到一钱来重的一包。用这一点点糖精就可以代替白糖作四十多斤蛋糕或四十多瓶汽水。为什么糖精比糖甜四、五百倍，反倒比白糖的价钱贱的多呢？
    糖精和糖，是完全不同的两种东西。糖是从甘蔗、甜菜里提取出来的；而糖精是从煤焦油里提炼加工而来。从成份上来看，糖是由碳原子、氧原子、氢原子结合在一起而成的；而糖精除了含有碳、氧、氢原子以外，还含有硫、氮和钠原子。正因为煤焦油比较容易得到，同时也不受农作物的收成影响，所以糖精的价格也低廉。
    很多人宁愿多花一点钱去买白糖，也不愿买比白糖贱得多的糖精，因为他们害怕糖精对身体有害。其实，根据科学家的研究，人在吃了糖精以后，一般在二十四小时以内，就可以把吃进去的糖精基本上全部由小便里排泄出来。这样糖精也就不会对身体有什么影响。当然，如果吃得太多了，是会妨碍正常的消化机能。但是因为糖精太甜，使用的时候只要放上很少一点就可以了；用多了，反倒会甜的成了苦味。用一斤面粉作糕点时，最多用四分之一分重（0.07克）的糖精；作一升汽水或其他饮料，最多用半分重（0.15克）的糖精。这样少的糖精，对人的身体是不碍事的。
    糖精只是用来调味，对人并没有什么营养价值。但是糖的营养价值也不大。喜欢吃甜味的人，每天吃的甜东西，最多也就合上个二、三两白糖。这二、三两重的白糖大约可发出二、三百卡的热量。在我们每天吃的粮食里，有着丰富的糖类。我们吃的米、面，都是由淀粉组成的，淀粉就会变成大量的糖。一个二两半重的馒头，可以变出一两多的糖；一个五两重的窝窝头也可以生成二两半重的糖。如果一个人每天吃上一斤左右的粮食，就可以得到约十多两重的糖的营养。因此，如果不专门吃那二、三两白糖，也不会缺少糖的营养的。
