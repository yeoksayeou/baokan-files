A Debate on Double-Cropping Rice
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Hong Tao

　　The promotion of double-cropping rice in the high-yield area of Jiangsu Province—Songjiang Special District—has a history of two years. Last year, the average yield per mu of more than 250,000 mu of double-cropping rice in the entire district was more than 600 jin, not more productive than the year before. In some places, the work was done more diligently, and the yield of double-cropping rice was higher; in some places, the work was not done diligently enough, and the yield of double-cropping rice was not as high as that of single-cropping rice. Therefore, in areas with lower yields, some cadres and the masses have some resistance to continuing to plant double-cropping rice.

　　Recently, when the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences organized an expert inspection team to go to Songjiang Special District, Jiangsu Province, to conduct an inspection of double-cropping rice, the CPC Songjiang Prefectural Committee specifically convened a symposium attended by typical agricultural cooperative chairmen, old farmers, agricultural technical cadres, and expert professors to launch a major debate on the question of "Can double-cropping rice be grown well?"

　　Can Double-Cropping Rice Increase Production?

　　At the beginning of the meeting, some people raised the question of whether double-cropping rice can increase production. Some cooperatives with reduced production believed that the yield of single-cropping rice in Songjiang Special District has always been very high, and planting double-cropping rice may not catch up with the yield of single-cropping rice. Zhong Xiangfa of Xinglong Third Cooperative in Songjiang County also cited the fact that the average yield of single-cropping late rice in the society last year was 650 jin, while that of double-cropping rice was less than 500 jin, proving that the yield of double-cropping rice was not as stable as that of single-cropping rice. However, most agricultural cooperative representatives disagreed with this statement. They also cited the fact that the double-cropping yield of their own cooperative was higher than that of single-cropping, arguing that they should not arbitrarily deny the promotion of double-cropping rice because they did not grow it well. Agricultural technical cadres in Fengxian County reported that the yield of double-cropping rice in the county was not only higher than that of single-cropping rice, but also higher than that of two crops of rice and wheat, and two crops of early rice and late autumn mung beans. Last year, the county planted more than 50,000 mu of double-cropping rice, with an average yield of 800 jin per mu, which is an increase of 210 jin per mu compared with the original early rice and late autumn mung beans. The result of the debate was that in densely populated areas with limited land and high grain yields, the main way to develop agricultural production in the future is to increase the yield per unit area. How to increase the yield per unit area? In addition to two crops of rice and wheat, the potential for increasing production with double-cropping rice is definitely greater than that of single-cropping rice.

　　Can Double-Cropping Rice Increase Income?

　　After everyone unanimously affirmed that double-cropping rice can increase production, some people raised the issue of "although double-cropping rice can increase production, it cannot increase income." An old farmer from Xinxing Cooperative in Qingpu County reflected that double-cropping rice has "one high and three bads (that is, high yield, high cost, high labor, and low net income)." Representatives of various agricultural cooperatives made accounting comparisons during the debate.

　　According to the calculation results of Xinlian Cooperative in Qingpu County, Shuguang North Cooperative in Fengxian County, and Machang Cooperative in Nanhui County, double-cropping rice not only has a high yield, but also has a high net income; it not only increases income compared to growing single-cropping rice, but also increases income compared to growing two crops of rice and wheat or two crops of early rice and late autumn mung beans. Shen Dexing, an old farmer from Shuguang North Cooperative in Fengxian County, said excitedly: "As long as double-cropping rice can increase production and income, it doesn't matter if it costs a little more and requires more labor." Jiang Zhaoming, chairman of Bayi Cooperative in Jinshan County, said: "The main cost of double-cropping rice is in fertilizer; if we raise more pigs and accumulate more natural fertilizer in the future, the cost can be saved even more, and the income of cooperative members can be increased even more."

　　Can Double-Cropping Rice Be Grown Well?

　　Although the issue of increasing production and income has been resolved, can double-cropping rice be grown well? Representatives of some cooperatives with reduced production showed a lack of confidence. At this time, the representative of the CPC Songjiang Prefectural Committee who presided over the meeting asked: Why are there many agricultural cooperatives in the same special district that can grow double-cropping rice well, and why did Fengxian County have 54 "thousand-jin cooperatives"? Some cooperatives with reduced production in Jinshan County believed that the soil quality in Jinshan was not as good as that in Fengxian, and some cooperatives with reduced production in Songjiang County emphasized that the climate was not good. Yang Guishun, chairman of Haoguang Cooperative in Jinshan County, cited the example of the wide disparity in yield last year between two production teams in the society with the same climate and soil conditions, and opposed shifting the responsibility for reduced production to objective reasons. What are the main reasons for the reduction in production? The Songjiang Prefectural Committee organized representatives from the increased production cooperatives and the reduced production cooperatives present at the meeting to exchange experiences and lessons, and finally summarized the following preliminary opinions: First, the Party committee relaxed its leadership. In 1956, the Party committee grasped every link of double-cropping rice very tightly. In 1957, in order to avoid repeating the past lessons, some were a little hesitant and there was a certain degree of laissez-faire in leadership. Second, in terms of technical guidance, there was some accommodation to the conservative and backward side, so that some technical measures that had already been affirmed could not be consistently implemented. Third, some agricultural cooperatives that had increased production and received awards the year before developed complacency and slackened their efforts in production. After debate and summary, everyone clearly realized that the reason why double-cropping rice was not grown well was mainly not due to objective conditions, but to insufficient subjective efforts. Chen Cheng, an agricultural engineer who was often stationed in Songjiang Special District in 1956 to provide technical guidance, said: "As long as everyone puts in the same effort as during the high-yield movement in 1956, double-cropping rice will definitely be grown successfully."

　　Should Double-Cropping Rice Be Developed?

　　The Songjiang Prefectural Committee organized the representatives attending the meeting to further study and formulate the 1958 double-cropping rice area plan. During the discussion of the plan, many people believed that double-cropping rice is very seasonal and technical, and in the future it should only reduce the area, not expand it. Even Jianxin Cooperative in Jinshan, which had a bumper harvest of double-cropping rice in 1957, also planned to reduce the area of double-cropping rice in 1958 from 1,000 mu to 710 mu. Rice experts Tang Yugeng, Professor Gao Limin and others all doubted why the area should be reduced even after double-cropping rice had a bumper harvest. Expert representative Wang Yuanqian said: In Songjiang Special District, which is fully equipped with double-cropping rice planting conditions and has accumulated several years of cultivation experience, the planting of double-cropping rice in the future should only be gradually developed, not gradually reduced. The question is only whether or not to put in the effort. Xu Ziman, an agricultural technician who specially came from Wuhu to participate in the meeting, introduced that double-cropping rice planted in Anhui Province last year increased production even under natural conditions that were much worse than those in the Taihu Lake area of Jiangsu. Experts who had recently visited Hubei Province to investigate the situation of double-cropping rice further cited the example of Xiaogan County, whose latitude is similar to that of Songjiang Special District, but the yield of double-cropping rice generally reached 1,000 jin, indicating that the potential of double-cropping rice in Songjiang Special District is very high, and the existing double-cropping rice, which accounts for less than 10% of the total rice area, cannot be reduced any further. Wu Zhenzhong, a white-haired and well-known rice stem borer control expert, also specifically analyzed the law that the smaller the area of double-cropping rice, the more serious the rice stem borer damage. After repeated debates and experts introduced the experience and situation of other provinces, the agricultural cooperative chairmen and old farmers present at the meeting generally broadened their horizons, increased their confidence, and re-formulated and revised the plan to expand double-cropping rice with a positive attitude.

    关于双季稻的一场辩论
    洪滔
    江苏省高产地区——松江专区推广双季稻已有两年的历史，去年全区二十五万余亩双季稻平均亩产六百多斤，不比前年增产。其中有些地方工作抓得较紧，双季稻产量较高；有些地方抓得不紧，双季稻产量还没有单季稻高。因而在产量较低的地方，有些干部、群众对继续种植双季稻就有了一些抵触情绪。
    最近，当中国农业科学院组织专家考察团前往江苏省松江专区进行双季稻考察的时候，中共松江地委特地召开了一次有典型农业社社长、老农、农业技术干部和专家教授共同出席的座谈会，对“双季稻能不能种好”的问题展开了一场大辩论。
    双季稻能不能增产
    会议一开始，就有人提出双季稻能不能增产的问题。有些减产社认为松江专区单季稻产量一向很高，种双季稻不一定能赶上单季稻产量。松江县兴隆三社锺祥发还列举了该社去年单季晚稻单产六百五十斤、双季稻不到五百斤的事实，证明双季产量不如单季稳定。但多数农业社代表不同意这种说法，他们也列举了本县本社双季产量高于单季的事实进行辩驳，指出不能因为自己没有种好而随意否定推广双季稻。奉贤县农业技术干部反映，该县双季稻产量不仅比单季稻高，而且比稻麦两熟、早稻与晚秋绿豆两熟的产量都要高。该县去年共种五万多亩双季稻，平均亩产八百斤，即比原来早稻与晚秋绿豆每亩增产二百一十斤。辩论结果认为：在地少人多的粮食高产区，今后发展农业生产的主要途径是提高单位面积产量。如何提高单位面积产量？除稻麦两熟外，双季稻的增产潜力肯定比单季稻大。
    双季稻能不能增收
    在大家一致肯定双季稻能够增产的前提后，有些人又提出“双季稻虽能增产，但不能增收”。青浦县新兴社老农反映：双季稻“一高三不好（即产量高、成本大、人工多、纯收入少）”。各农业社代表在辩论时进行了算账对比。
    据青浦县新联社、奉贤县曙光北社和南汇县马厂社等社的比算结果证明：双季稻不仅产量高，纯收益也高；不仅比种单季稻增加收入，比种稻麦两熟或早稻晚秋绿豆两熟也同样能增加收入。奉贤县曙光北社老农沈德兴兴奋地说：“只要双季稻能够增产增收，多花点成本、人工，也没有什么不好。”金山县八一社社长蒋照明说：“双季稻多花的成本主要在肥料上；如果以后多养些猪、多积些自然肥料，成本还可节省一些，社员收入还可增加更多一些。”
    双季稻能不能种好
    增产增收问题虽然解决了，但能不能种好双季稻呢？有些减产社的代表表现出信心不足。这时，主持会议的中共松江地委代表就提出：为什么在同一个专区却有不少农业社能够种好双季稻、奉贤一个县并出现五十四个千斤社呢？金山县有的减产社认为金山土质不如奉贤，松江有些减产社强调气候不好。金山县浩光社社长杨桂顺，举出该社具备同等气候、土质的两个生产队去年产量悬殊的实例，反对把减产责任推卸到客观原因上去。减产主要原因究竟何在？松江地委组织到会的增产社和减产社代表互相交流经验教训，最后归纳出这样的初步意见：第一、党委放松领导。1956年，党委对双季稻的每个环节都抓得很紧，1957年为了害怕重复过去的教训，有些小手小脚，并在领导上出现一定程度的自流现象。第二、在技术指导上有些迁就保守落后的一面，使有些已经肯定的技术措施，不能坚持贯彻。第三、有一部分前年增产和受奖的农业社，产生了骄傲自满情绪，生产上松了劲。经过辩论和总结，大家都明确地认识了双季稻没有种好的原因，主要不是受到客观条件的限制，而是主观上努力不够。1956年曾经常驻松江专区进行技术指导的农业工程师陈澄说：“只要大家拿出1956年开展高额丰产运动时期那样的劲头来，双季稻保证会种得成功。”
    双季稻要不要发展
    松江地委又组织到会的代表进一步研究制订1958年双季稻面积规划。在讨论规划中，许多人认为双季稻季节性和技术性很强，今后只宜缩小面积，不能扩大面积。连1957年双季稻获得大丰收的金山建新社，也准备将1958年双季稻面积由一千亩缩减到七百一十亩。水稻专家汤玉庚、教授高立民等都怀疑，为什么双季稻已经获得丰收还要缩小面积呢？专家代表王元乾说：在充分具备双季稻种植条件和已经积累几年栽培经验的松江专区，今后双季稻的种植只宜逐步发展，不应逐步削减，问题只是在于肯不肯拿出劲头来。特地由芜湖赶来参加会议的农技师徐紫满等介绍：安徽省去年种植的双季稻，在比江苏太湖地区自然条件差得多的情况下还增产了。前些日子曾到湖北省考察过双季稻情况的专家更列举了孝感县纬度与松江专区差不多，双季稻产量却普遍达到千斤的实例，说明松江专区双季稻潜力很大，现有占水稻总面积不到10％的双季稻不能再缩减。白发苍苍的著名治螟专家吴振锺还特地从科学理论上分析了双季稻面积越小，螟害越重的规律。通过反复辩论和专家们介绍别省经验、情况后，到会的农业社社长、老农普遍打开了眼界，提高了信心，重新以积极的态度制订和修订了扩大双季稻的规划。
