　　In last year's All-Soviet Art Exhibition, there was a famous sculpture "We Will Beat Swords into Plowshares." This work of art is not empty propaganda, but expresses the lofty will of the Soviet people to love peace. The Soviet government is now preparing to convert a submarine into an research vessel in order to carry out underwater scientific research, so that the ocean can benefit mankind more. This is a manifestation of this will.

　　However, the American ruling clique recently openly announced that it would implement a policy of turning butter into guns. Brigadier General Bush, Deputy Director of the U.S. Air Force Research and Development Department, even arrogantly clamored on the 28th: "The United States must control the moon" and should use the moon as a base for launching "weapons of mass destruction" against certain areas of the earth.

　　Who really wants peace and who really wants war is crystal clear.

    两种做法
    在去年全苏美术展览会上有一件著名的雕塑“我们来把刀剑炼成犁头”，这件艺术品并不是空洞的宣传，而是表达了苏联人民热爱和平的崇高意志。苏联政府现在准备把一艘潜水艇改装成考察船，以便进行水底的科学研究工作，要海洋更多地为人类造福。这正是这种意志的表现。
    但是美国统治集团最近公开宣布要实行变黄油为大炮的政策。美国空军研究和发展部副主任布希准将28日甚至狂妄地叫嚣：“美国必须控制月球”，应当把月球作为向地球某些地区发射“大规模毁灭性武器”的基地。
    谁真正要和平，谁真正要战争，是一清二楚的。
