    Dependence Hurts Me Badly
    The bitterness of being in debt for more than two consecutive years has deeply educated me.
    I transitioned from a long period of enjoying the supply system to being paid a wage. During the period of enjoying the supply system, I had no family burden, and although the monthly allowance figure was not large, I lived quite comfortably. In 1955, I switched to a wage system, and when my salary was adjusted in 1956, my and my wife's monthly income increased from over 120 yuan to over 160 yuan. Logically speaking, this money should have been enough to support a family of nine and provide for three children to attend school. However, because the ideology of the supply system had not been eradicated, I always thought of myself as a state cadre, unafraid of natural disasters or man-made calamities, and had no desire to buy land or property. I truly believed I had no worries about food and clothing, so what was the point of saving? Every time after receiving my salary, I would spend it recklessly without any planning. Therefore, I often relied on borrowing money to get through to the end of the month. Although I encountered some difficulties, the lesson was not deep enough due to my considerable income, and the old habit of "rich for only three days, poor for less than a month" was still at play.
    In 1956, my hometown suffered a flood, and my long-separated elder sister and younger sister came to Beijing with their children and stayed for half a year each, their round-trip travel expenses alone costing over a hundred yuan. At this time, my two children fell ill one after another, costing seventy or eighty yuan. Immediately afterwards, my mother fell ill and stayed in the hospital for a month and a half, with expenses totaling over two hundred yuan. With this series of problems occurring, my debts gradually increased to over two hundred and sixty yuan, forming a situation of monthly income not covering expenses.
    Although the organization had shown concern and provided assistance many times, I always complained that the organization's care was not enough. When others criticized me for not being able to manage my household, I emphasized that others did not understand the situation, or I considered it an insult and ridicule. My mental burden was very heavy, and I often vented on innocent children, often making the whole family unhappy.
    After the great rectification movement began, the education of many vivid facts gradually awakened me, enabling me to criticize the ideology of relying on the organization, resolve the relationship between individual interests and collective interests, re-comprehend the great significance of building the country and managing the household with diligence and thrift, and find a way to manage life.
    After we comprehensively planned our family expenses, in just over half a year, we had already repaid over two hundred yuan of debt and planned to pay off the last debt this month. At that time, how relaxed and happy the whole family would be!
    On this basis, we have also discussed the 1958 savings plan. This year, in addition to buying fifty yuan of public bonds, we will strive to deposit one hundred and fifty to two hundred yuan in the bank for emergencies. For a family of nine like ours, who can guarantee that there will be no unexpected expenses? If you don't have savings yourself, and you go to the organization to solve problems when you have difficulties, wouldn't this add unnecessary burdens to the country? If everyone can adhere to the principle of managing the household diligently and thriftily and reduce our dependence on society, this is also a kind of support for socialist construction.

    依赖思想害苦了我
    连续两年多的负债苦头，深深的教育了我。
    我是由长期享受供给制改为工薪制的。在享受供给制的时期，没有家庭负担，每月津贴数字虽然不大，但也生活得很适宜。1955年改为工薪制了，到1956年调薪时，我和爱人每月收入由一百二十余元增加到一百六十余元。按理说，这些钱负担一个九口人之家，供给三个孩子读书，是很富裕的。但由于供给制的思想未根除，总认为自己是国家的干部，既不怕天灾人祸，也不想买田置地，真所谓吃穿不愁，要积蓄干啥呢？每当发薪后，就毫无计划地大手大脚的乱花。因此，每到月终常常靠借债过日子，虽也碰过一些困难，终因收入不少，教训不深，那种“富不了三天，穷不了一月”的老毛病还在作祟。
    1956年家乡遭了水灾，久别的姐姐和妹妹带着孩子来京各过半年之久，她们往返的路费即开支了百余元。就在这时，我的两个孩子又连续生病，花了七、八十元。紧接着，母亲又生病，住医院一个半月，前后开支二百余元。这一连串的问题发生了，我的债务逐渐增加到二百六十余元，形成月月入不敷出。
    组织上虽曾多次关怀，多次接济，可是我却总是埋怨组织照顾不够。当别人对我提出批评，说我不会料理家务的时候，我又强调别人不了解情况，或者认为是对自己的污辱与讽刺。自己精神负担很重，往往拿无罪的孩子来消气，常常弄得全家都不愉快。
    当伟大的整风运动开始后，在许多活生生的事实教育下，使我渐渐的清醒过来，批判了依赖组织的思想，解决了个人利益与集体利益的关系，重新领会到勤俭建国和勤俭持家的伟大意义，找到了处理生活的门路。
    当我们全面规划了家庭开支以后，仅仅半年多的时间，已经偿还了二百余元债务，计划在本月内将最后一笔债务还清。那时，全家该是多么轻松愉快啊！
    在这个基础上，我们又商订了1958年的积蓄计划。今年，除了购买公债五十元，争取在银行存款一百五十元到二百元，以备不时之需。像我们这样一个九口之家，谁能保证没有意外开支呢？如果自己没有储蓄，有了困难就去找组织解决，这岂不是给国家增添了不必要的负担吗？如果人人都能坚持勤俭持家的原则，减少我们对社会的依赖，这也是我们对社会主义建设的一种支持。
