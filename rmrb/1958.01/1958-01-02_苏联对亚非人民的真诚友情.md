    The Soviet Union's Sincere Friendship with the People of Asia and Africa

    The Soviet representatives participating in the Asian-African Solidarity Conference proposed at the meeting on December 27th to provide Asian and African countries with economic assistance without any conditions attached, which was welcomed by a storm of applause from the representatives of all countries present. This vivid scene shows the deep friendship between the Soviet people and the people of Asian and African countries!

    For forty years, the Soviet Union has followed the instructions of the great Lenin regarding the fate of the people of the East, and has shown infinite enthusiasm for and support to the struggles of the Asian and African peoples to win and safeguard national independence. In the struggle of the Asian and African peoples to get rid of the shackles of Western colonialism, the Soviet people have always enthusiastically offered encouragement and tried in every possible way to provide assistance. After many Asian and African countries gained independence, the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect, and non-interference in internal affairs, developing mutually beneficial cooperation with Asian and African countries, helping these countries establish and develop their own independent economies, without attaching any political conditions.

    Without going into the distant past, simply citing the facts of recent years is enough to illustrate that the Soviet Union's assistance to economically underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa is invaluable "sending charcoal in the snow." The Soviet Union's tremendous assistance to India and Afghanistan has greatly reduced the obstacles they encountered on the road to building their own independent economies, enabling them to implement industrialization according to established plans. The Soviet Union's timely assistance to Egypt and Syria has enabled them to overcome the serious difficulties encountered in their domestic economic lives under the economic blockade imposed by Western imperialism, rendering the imperialists' economic pressure on them ineffective, and greatly enhancing their strength in safeguarding national independence. The sincere assistance of the Soviet Union has inspired the confidence and courage of the Asian and African people in their struggle to safeguard national independence and sovereignty.

    In contrast to the Soviet Union's attitude, the so-called "aid" to Asian and African countries touted by U.S. imperialism is, in fact, the enslavement and exploitation of the people of the "aided" countries. The terms of U.S. loans are extremely harsh, not only restricting their use, but also attaching political conditions, forcing these countries to expand their military preparations and participate in military blocs. Facts show that the country that receives the most "U.S. aid" also loses the most national sovereignty. Now, the people of Asia and Africa have fully recognized the essence of the so-called "aid" of U.S. imperialism, and they are no longer willing to be fooled. In recent years, U.S. imperialism has had to slightly ease its loan conditions for some countries, and this is the reason. But even so, the terms of U.S. loans are actually still very harsh. As Mohieddin, the deputy head of the Egyptian delegation, said at the Asian-African Solidarity Conference: This kind of U.S. aid is in fact a new manifestation of colonialism.

    The Soviet representatives' proposal to provide unconditional economic assistance to Asian and African countries has added valuable content to the Asian-African Solidarity Conference. We believe that the Asian-African Solidarity Conference will certainly be able to make new contributions in strengthening the friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation between Asian and African countries.

    苏联对亚非人民的真诚友情
    本报评论员
    参加亚非团结大会的苏联代表，在12月27日的会议上提出给亚非国家以不附有任何条件的经济援助的建议，受到了与会各国代表暴风雨般的掌声欢迎。这个生动的场面，显示了苏联人民同亚非各国人民之间的深切的友情！
    四十年来，苏联遵循着伟大列宁关怀东方各族人民命运的指示，对亚非各国人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争，寄予无限热烈的同情和支持。在亚非各国人民为摆脱西方殖民主义羁绊的斗争中，苏联人民总是热情洋溢地给予鼓励，并多方设法加以援助；而在许多亚非国家取得独立之后，苏联始终不渝地本着平等互利、互相尊重和互不干涉内政的原则，同亚非国家发展互助合作关系，帮助这些国家建立和发展自己的独立经济，而不附带任何政治条件。
    远的不说，单举最近几年来的事实，就足以说明苏联对亚非经济不发达国家的援助是非常可贵的“雪里送炭”。苏联对印度、阿富汗的巨大援助，使它们大大减少了建设自己独立经济道路上所遇到的障碍，得以按照既定的计划实行工业化。苏联对埃及、叙利亚的及时援助，使它们在西方帝国主义实行经济封锁的情况下，得以克服国内经济生活中所遇到的严重困难，使帝国主义对它们的经济压力归于无效，大大增强了它们保卫民族独立的力量。苏联的真诚援助，鼓舞了亚非人民维护民族独立主权的斗争信心和勇气。
    同苏联的态度相反，美帝国主义所标榜的所谓对亚非国家的“援助”，事实上是奴役和剥削受“援”国家人民。美国的贷款条件极其苛刻，不仅限制用途，并且附加政治条件，强迫这些国家扩军备战，参加军事集团。事实说明，那个国家接受“美援”最多，它所丧失的国家主权也最多。现在，亚非人民已经完全认清了美帝国主义的所谓“援助”的实质，它们再不愿意上当了。近年来，美帝国主义不得不对某些国家稍微放宽它的贷款条件，就是这个缘故。但是，即使如此，美国的贷款条件其实仍旧是十分苛刻的。埃及代表团副团长毛希丁在亚非团结大会上说得好：美国的这种援助事实上是殖民主义的一种新的表现。
    苏联代表提出无条件的对亚非国家进行经济援助的建议，给亚非团结大会增添了可贵的内容。我们相信，亚非团结大会在加强亚非国家之间的友好团结和互助合作方面一定能作出新的贡献。
