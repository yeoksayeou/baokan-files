    Good Reform Methods of the Harbin Construction Bureau:
    Get Out of the Office, Go to the Masses
    (Our dispatch) Since the start of the rectification movement, the Harbin Construction Bureau has successively received many opinions and requests from factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, and street residents. During the rectification and improvement phase, the Construction Bureau conscientiously studied the opinions of the masses and established several specialized groups to conduct in-depth investigations on the key issues raised by the masses, and promptly solved many major problems. For example, the transportation around Dafangli near Binjiang Railway Station in Daowai District was very inconvenient. This time, the Construction Bureau studied the issue together with the masses, mobilized the masses to do it themselves, and built a wide road, which satisfied the residents. Other issues, such as the installation of street lights and the management of parks, were also perfectly resolved after consultation with the masses.
    On January 24, the Harbin Daily published this news, along with a commentary entitled "Get Out of the Office and Go to the Masses," saying: The Construction Bureau's approach to improving its work is worth emulating by some units that are currently in the rectification phase. When the cadres of the Construction Bureau get out of the office and go to the masses to study specific problems together, they not only find the root of the contradictions, but also solve many problems that were originally considered unsolvable or difficult to solve in the office. Some things do not require the use of government funds at all; as long as the masses are organized, they can solve the problems themselves. For example, the dirt road in Dafangli Street in Daowai District was repaired by mobilizing the masses to do it themselves, saving government expenditures, and the masses were very satisfied.
    Going out of the office to find the people who raised the opinions and study the problems face-to-face can further enhance the cadres' mass viewpoint, thereby avoiding subjective handling of problems. For example, regarding the issue of installing rainwater wells on Daxing Street in Daowai District, the Construction Bureau originally planned to install twenty, but when they convened relevant residents for a discussion and solicited their opinions, they believed that nine would be sufficient.
    Going out of the office to handle problems can also cultivate the cadres' style of investigation and research. For example, the Construction Bureau originally felt that the residents of some remote streets' requests to install street lights were quite thorny, believing that there were no line materials and that funds could not be resolved for a while. However, after they ran to the site for specific investigation and research, they felt that solving this problem was very easy. It turned out that some remote streets had street light line equipment in the past, and only needed to be repaired and installed with lamp holders.
    Another benefit of going out of the office to handle problems is that it can carry out publicity and education work among the residents. Many residents living near stone roads requested to convert the stone roads to asphalt roads. These residents only considered that asphalt roads are more beautiful and smoother than stone roads, but they did not think that converting stone roads to asphalt roads on some streets would not be suitable for the passage of heavy vehicles and animal-drawn vehicles, thereby affecting the current transportation work. At the same time, these residents did not consider that the life of asphalt roads is very short and they need to be repaired frequently. After these situations were explained to the street residents, they had no further opinions.
    Currently, China's industrial and agricultural production is in a period of great leap forward, and our government work should also have a great leap forward. Let us sweep away the staleness, eliminate bureaucratism, abandon old working methods, and, with revolutionary vigor, adopt new working methods and leap forward by leaps and bounds!

### 哈尔滨建设局整改的好办法  走出办公室  到群众中去

    哈尔滨建设局整改的好办法
    走出办公室  到群众中去
    本报讯　哈尔滨建设局从整风运动开始以来，陆续收到工厂、企业、机关、学校和街道居民提出的许多意见和要求。在整改中，建设局认真研究了群众的意见，并且成立了几个专门小组，对群众提出的意见有重点地进行深入调查，及时地解决了许多重大问题。如道外滨江火车站附近的大方里，交通很不方便。这次建设局和群众一起研究，发动群众自己动手，修了一条宽广的马路，居民感到满意。其他如路灯的安装、园林的管理等问题，都在和群众一起商量后获得了完满的解决。
    1月24日哈尔滨日报在刊登这个消息的同时，以“走出办公室到群众中去”为题发表评论说：建设局改进工作的做法，是很值得当前一些正处于整改阶段的单位效仿的。建设局的干部们走出办公室到群众中去同群众一起具体研究问题时，不仅找到矛盾的所在，而且很多原来在办公室里认为不能解决或不大好解决的问题，都一一迎刃而解。有些事根本不需要动用政府资金，只要把群众组织起来，群众就自己动手来解决。如道外大方里街的土道，就是经发动群众自己动手修好的，政府节省了开支，群众还十分满意。
    走出办公室找提意见人当面研究问题，可以进一步增强干部的群众观点，从而避免主观地处理问题。例如，在道外大兴街安设雨水井的问题，建设局原定安二十个，可是当召集有关居民进行座谈，征求他们的意见，他们认为安九个就满可以了。
    走出办公室处理问题还可以培养干部的调查研究作风。例如，建设局原来对于某些偏僻街道居民要求设置路灯问题是颇感棘手的，认为线路材料没有，资金一时也解决不了，可是当他们跑到现场进行具体调查研究后，感到解决这个问题很容易，原来某些偏僻街道过去就有路灯线路设备，只要进行一番整修和安上灯头就行了。
    走出办公室处理问题的好处还在于，可以向居民群众进行宣传教育工作。很多居住在石头马路附近的居民，要求将石头路改修为柏油路，这些居民只考虑到柏油路比石头路美观，平坦，但没有想到，在某些街道如将石头路改修为柏油路，将不适于通行重型车和兽力车，因而会影响当前的交通运输工作。同时，这些居民也没考虑到，柏油路的寿命是很短的，还要经常整修。当把这一些情况向街道居民讲清之后，他们就再也没有什么意见了。
    当前，我国的工农业生产正处于大跃进的时期，我们的机关工作也应该有个大跃进，让我们扫除暮气，打掉官气，抛弃旧的工作方法，以革命的干劲，采用新的工作方法，大踏步地向前跃进吧！
