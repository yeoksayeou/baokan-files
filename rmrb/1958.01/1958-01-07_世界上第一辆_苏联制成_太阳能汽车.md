Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th -- Soviet scientists and engineers, based on the most advanced achievements of modern physics, have created the world's first "solar car." It is currently being tested and improved.

This car is powered by a "solar battery" that can directly convert solar energy into electrical energy. It does not require gasoline, nor does it require overhead wires like a tram.

The "solar battery" is composed of a large number of small parts made of pure silicon (extracted from sand). First, several contact points are welded onto a very pure, thin silicon wafer using a precious rare metal - indium. Then, several hundred silicon wafers with contact points are placed in a container and covered with a layer of glass. Finally, two wires are connected separately to all the silicon wafers and all the contact points, as the positive and negative electrodes of the battery. Thus, the "solar battery" is made.

The "solar battery" is installed on the outside of the car's roof. After being irradiated by sunlight, it can generate electricity to power the car's engine. A storage battery needs to be installed between the "solar battery" and the engine to provide power when there is no sunlight.

The operation of the solar car is very simple. The car has a steering wheel and two foot pedals. One foot pedal is used to adjust the current, and the other is used to brake.

Tests have shown that in sunny areas, such as some roads in Crimea and Central Asia in the Soviet Union, the "solar car" runs very well. In areas with insufficient sunlight, it cannot travel too far or too fast. Soviet scientists are conducting further research and improvements, preparing to design "solar batteries" that can generate stronger currents, so that storage batteries can store more electricity. Then, this car can run even in the dark or on cloudy days.

    世界上第一辆
    苏联制成“太阳能汽车”
    新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联科学家和工程师在现代物理学最先进成就的基础上，制成了世界上第一辆“太阳能汽车”。目前正在试验、改进中。
    这种汽车是用一种能够直接把太阳能变为电能的“太阳电池”来开动的。它不需要汽油，也不需要像电车那样的架空电线。
    “太阳电池”由大量的用纯硅（从砂子里提炼出来的）制造的小零件组成。先在很纯的薄薄的硅片上，用一种贵重的稀有金属——铟，焊上几个接触点，然后把几百个带有接触点的硅片放在一个器皿中并盖上一层玻璃板。最后，用两根电线分别接在所有的硅片上和所有的接触点上，作为电池的正、负极。这样，“太阳电池”便制成了。
    “太阳电池”装在汽车顶上的外部，经过太阳光的照射，便能发出电来，供给汽车发动机使用。在“太阳电池”和发动机之间还需装上一个蓄电池，以备在没有阳光照射时供电之用。
    太阳能汽车的操纵很简单。汽车上有一个舵轮和两个踏脚板。其中一个踏脚板用来调整电流，另一个则用来刹车。
    试验证明，在阳光充足地区，例如苏联的克里米亚和中亚细亚的一些道路上，“太阳能汽车”行驶得很好，在阳光不很充足的地区则不能驶得太远太快。苏联科学家正在作进一步的研究和改进。准备设计出能够发出更强电流的“太阳电池”来，使蓄电池能贮存更多的电。那么，这种汽车即使在黑夜或阴天也能行驶了。
