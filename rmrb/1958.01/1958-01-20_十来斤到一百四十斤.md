    From Ten-Odd Jin to One Hundred Forty Jin
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Fang Di
    Can cotton production achieve a great leap forward in barren mountainous areas? The Jiufeng First Agricultural Cooperative in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, has answered this question affirmatively with facts.

    This is a truly mountainous agricultural cooperative. Small plots of land are arranged crisscross on a group of undulating hills, not only is the soil poor, but also the irrigation conditions are very poor. Two or three years ago, these lands were mainly planted with miscellaneous grains such as sweet potatoes and sesame, and very little cotton was planted. At that time, cotton fields mostly only produced ten-odd jin of ginned cotton per mu, and the best did not exceed twenty jin.

    But since the realization of cooperativization, the situation has changed rapidly. In 1956, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in this area increased to eighty-eight jin. In 1957, the entire cooperative achieved a great harvest of one hundred and forty-one jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of nearly ten times compared to 1955.

    This is truly an amazing great leap forward! When harvesting cotton, the members composed快板诗 (a type of rhythmic storytelling) to praise the good year, saying: "Miracles happen in the mountains, silver covers the ground; the more we work, the more energetic we become, striving forward." After visiting, the surrounding farmers also discussed: "If such places can leap forward, other places can leap forward even more."

    Two years, this time is indeed not long. But why can production increase nearly tenfold? To answer this question, we must first start from 1955.

    In the summer of 1955, Hu Ziqing, a cadre and Communist Party member from the township where this cooperative was located, visited the high-yield cotton areas of Liuji and Dadu in the county. At that time, Jiufeng First Cooperative had not yet been established. When Hu Ziqing returned from the visit, he brought back some Dai character cotton improved varieties, ready for trial planting.

    Soon, the high tide of cooperativization arrived. Hu Ziqing, together with dozens of farmers, established a small agricultural cooperative in the high tide, determined to rely on the collective strength to develop production. At that time, some wealthy middle peasants who were unwilling to join the cooperative laughed at them, saying that they were "a bowl of water cannot stir up waves."

    "Can't we really stir up waves?" At the meeting to discuss the production increase plan, Hu Ziqing said: "No, we must stir it up for them to see." The members also offered suggestions, saying: "They have money to spend, we have no money so we must work hard." "To catch up with the wealthy middle peasants, we must find ways to improve the soil." "Yes, we must make the land stand up!" After some debate, the agricultural cooperative decided to start by improving the soil. The next day, men and women all got to work: carrying pond mud, moving manure, and shoveling turf. Throughout the winter, people changed the color of the land.

    Winter passed. In the spring of 1956, Hu Ziqing began to sow the Dai character cotton (improved variety) that he had brought back from the county. No one in this area had planted this new variety of cotton before. Who knew if it was good? Some people were skeptical. However, to greatly increase production, relying on local cotton was not feasible, everyone knew this; besides, didn't Liuji Township and Dadu Township achieve high yields by planting it? After a debate, it was decided to plant it. Hu Ziqing himself also set up an experimental plot, and put up a sign in the field, which read "Yield of ginned cotton per mu, one hundred and twenty jin."

    For this place, to produce one hundred and twenty jin of ginned cotton per mu, who would believe it? People passing by shook their heads when they saw the sign. Some people even said sarcastic remarks: "It hasn't even grown yet, and you're already talking big." "It's really a living ghost!" "It's almost the same if you put the cotton stalks together and weigh them." Hu Ziqing really felt uncomfortable at this time, but how could he tell those who were saying sarcastic remarks? He thought, the only way is to look at the facts. So, from the time the cotton was sown, he paid close attention to its growth, and went to the cotton field to work whenever he had time.

    The harvest season arrived. Looking at the fields, people could see that the Dai character cotton would yield more cotton than the local cotton. But how much better would it be? Could the experimental plot yield one hundred and twenty jin? This was still a mystery at the time. After several rounds of cotton picking, the mystery was finally solved: the average yield per mu was more than eighty jin of ginned cotton, about six times more than the local cotton; the experimental plot yielded a solid one hundred and twenty jin with a little extra.

    In the winter of 1956, the agricultural cooperative where Hu Ziqing was located merged with two other cooperatives in the township to form Jiufeng First Cooperative, increasing from the original dozens of households to two hundred and twenty-five households.

    Winter went and spring came, and 1957 began again. Based on the experience of the previous year, the cooperative's Party branch put forward the task of striving for a greater harvest of Dai character cotton. It stands to reason that since there was experience from the previous year, this time should be smoother! Who knew that there would still be a lot of ideological resistance. This was certainly related to the expansion of the cooperative, and also because some members said that the cloth woven from Dai character cotton was not good in color and not smooth (many people here spin and weave their own cloth); and some members were skeptical about the dense planting measures proposed this year.

    Hu Ziqing, who served as the Party branch secretary, and the cooperative cadres studied these problems together. Their conclusion was: first, the reason why the cloth woven from Dai character cotton was not good in color and not smooth was because the seeds were not properly preserved after being brought back from the county, and the seeds were not selected when sowing; the cotton in the experimental plot did not have the above shortcomings because it had been selected. Second, looking at the harvest of the previous year, one mu densely planted with four thousand seven hundred plants yielded one hundred and fourteen jin of ginned cotton; one mu densely planted with five thousand two hundred plants yielded one hundred and twenty-five jin; while those that only yielded more than eighty jin were only planted with more than three thousand plants. Therefore, they told the members about these situations and mobilized everyone to discuss whether Dai character cotton was good and whether dense planting was necessary. Only then did they solve the ideological problems of some members. As a result, Dai character cotton was sown entirely, and all the women in the cooperative were mobilized to select seeds before sowing, with nearly six thousand plants densely planted per mu.

    The cotton seedlings quickly grew vigorously, covering the entire cotton field with lush greenery. At this time, however, there were many consecutive days of continuous rain, and the cotton seedlings began to droop and turn yellow. Some members began to waver again: was it because they were planted too densely? The cooperative cadres were also as anxious as ants on a hot pot. Finally, based on the principle that scattering old brick soil on yellow rice seedlings can turn them green, they scattered old brick soil on the cotton fields, and at the same time organized forces to clear ditches and drain water, which reversed the situation.

    New difficulties followed, from the beginning of autumn, there was a long period of sunshine without rain, and large areas of cotton seedlings began to wither under the scorching sun. Everyone became uneasy again. Later, it was decided to carry water to irrigate the land. However, carrying water up the mountain was not a simple task. Although the entire cooperative was mobilized, the water was still in short supply. After carrying water for three consecutive days, seeing that the problem could not be solved, it was decided to try using waterwheels. Hu Ziqing took the lead in organizing an experiment in the second group: connecting several waterwheels in a row, and using mud to build dams in each place to be irrigated, so that the water flowed into the fields along the ditches. The experiment was very successful, and the next day, it was promoted throughout the cooperative. After dozens of days of battle, people finally overcame the drought and ensured a good harvest.

    The consecutive great harvests for two years made people deeply believe in the greatness of collective power. Member Hu Dongsheng said: "No wonder Chairman Mao wanted us to organize cooperatives, it turns out that cooperatives have such great power." Member Hu Xingting was a wealthy middle peasant, who originally planned to withdraw from the cooperative. After the harvest, he no longer talked about withdrawing from the cooperative, he said: "Now I want to stay in the cooperative forever."

    Now, Jiufeng First Cooperative has already formulated a production increase plan for 1958 and is striving to increase cotton production to two hundred and forty jin of ginned cotton per mu.

    十来斤到一百四十斤

    在土地贫瘠的山区能不能使棉花生产大跃进呢？湖北省新洲县久丰第一农业社已经用事实肯定地回答了这个问题。
    这是一个道道地地的山区农业社。在一群高低起伏的山岗上，纵横交错地布置着小块小块的土地，不仅土质不好，而且灌溉条件也很差。两三年前，这些土地主要是种植红苕、芝麻之类的杂粮，很少种棉花。那时，棉田大多只能亩产皮棉十来斤，最好的也不超过二十斤。
    可是自从实现了合作化以后，情况就迅速地变化了。1956年，这一带平均亩产皮棉提高到了八十八斤。1957年，全社更获得了亩产皮棉一百四十一斤的大丰收，比1955年增产近十倍。
    这真是了不起的大跃进！收摘棉花的时候，社员们编出快板诗赞美这个好年成说：“山区出奇迹，白银铺满地；越干越起劲，努力往前奔。”周围的农民前往参观后，也纷纷议论说：“这样的地方都能跃进，别的地方就更能跃进了。”
    两年，这时间的确不算长。可是，为什么能够增产近十倍呢？要回答这个问题，得先从1955年谈起。
    1955年夏天，这个社所在乡的干部、共产党员胡子青到县里的棉花高产地区刘集、大渡两乡参观。那时，久丰一社还没有建立。胡子青参观回来时，带回了一些岱字棉良种，准备试种。
    不久，合作化的高潮到来了，胡子青同几十户农民一起，在高潮中办起了一个不大的农业社，决心依靠集体的力量来发展生产。那时一些不愿入社的富裕中农，却在笑话他们，说他们是“碗水翻不起浪”。
    “当真翻不起浪吗？”在讨论增产规划的会上，胡子青说：“不，硬要翻给他们看看。”社员们也纷纷献计说：“他们有钱用钱办，我们无钱得用力干。”“要赶上富裕中农，得想法改良土壤。”“对，要叫土地翻身！”经过一番争论后，农业社决定首先着手改良土壤。第二天，男的女的都干起来了：挑的挑塘泥，搬的搬土粪，铲的铲草皮。整个冬天，人们使土地的颜色都变了。
    冬天过去了。1956年春天，开始在地里播种胡子青从县里带回的岱字棉（良种）。这一带还没人种过这新品种棉，谁知它是否好呢？有人有些怀疑。可是，要大增产，靠本地棉不行，这点大家也都知道；再说，人家刘集乡、大渡乡种了不是产量很高吗？经过一场争辩后，还是决定种。胡子青自己，还搞了一块试验地，在地里插了块牌子，上写“亩产皮棉一百二十斤。”
    对这个地方来说，一亩要产皮棉一百二十斤，有谁肯信呢？过路的人一看牌子就摇头。更有一些人大说风凉话：“还未长出来，就说大话了。”“真是活见鬼！”“把棉秆子放在一起称还差不多。”胡子青这时心里实在不好受，但又怎么去向那些说风凉话的人说呢？他想，唯一的办法，是看事实。于是，从棉花下种起，他就密切注意它的生长，一有空就到棉地里去干。
    收获季节到来了。往地里一看，人们就能够看出岱字棉会比本地棉多收棉花。但能好多少呢？试验地能否收一百二十斤呢？这在当时还是个谜。等几道棉花摘完后，这个谜终于解开了：一般的亩产八十多斤皮棉，比本地棉多六倍左右；试验地硬收了一百二十斤还有点零头。
    1956年冬天，胡子青所在的农业社和乡里另外两个社合并成久丰第一社，由原来的几十户增加到二百二十五户。
    冬去春来，1957年又开始了。根据头年的经验，社里的党支部提出了争取岱字棉更大丰收的任务。按说，既然有头一年的经验，这回该更顺利了吧！谁知思想抵触还是不少。这和社扩大了当然有关系，另外还因为有部分社员说，岱字棉产量高，但织出布来颜色不好看，不光滑（这里许多人都是自己纺纱织布的）；还有一部分社员对这年提出的密植措施有怀疑。
    担任党支部书记的胡子青和社干部们一起研究了这些问题。他们研究的结果是：第一，岱字棉织布颜色不好看、不光滑，是因为种籽从县里拿回后未保存好，播种时又未选种；那块试验地的棉因为经过选种，就没有上述缺点。第二，从头年的收成看，有一亩密植到四千七百棵，收了皮棉一百十四斤；有一亩密植到五千二百棵，收了一百二十五斤；而只收八十多斤的，都只植三千多棵。于是，他们把这些情况告诉社员，发动大家讨论，看究竟岱字棉好不好，要不要密植。这一来，才把部分社员的思想问题解决了。结果全部播种岱字棉，并在播种前发动全社妇女选了种，每亩密植到近六千棵。
    棉苗很快就茁壮地生长起来，把整个棉地盖得绿油油的。正在这个时候，却接连好多天阴雨连绵，棉苗开始低头、发黄。部分社员又动摇起来：是不是因为种得太密了呢？社里的干部们也一个个着急得像热锅上的蚂蚁。最后，他们根据稻田秧黄了撒陈砖土可以转青的道理，在棉地上撒了陈砖土，同时又组织力量清沟排水，才扭转了局面。
    新的困难接着又来了，从初秋开始，久晴不雨，大片棉苗在烈日的烘烤下开始枯萎。每个人又都不安起来。以后决定挑水灌地。可是，挑水上山不是简单的事。尽管全社都动员起来了，水仍然是供不应求。接连挑了三天，看看不能解决问题，又决定用车水的办法来试试。胡子青带头到第二组去组织试验：把几乘水车连着车，在每个要灌溉的地方用泥土筑成一道道的拦水坝，使水顺着沟流到地里去。试验结果很好，第二天，就在全社推广开了。经过几十天的战斗，人们终于战胜了干旱，保证了丰收。
    连续两年的大丰收，使人们深深地信服了集体力量的伟大。社员胡冬生说：“怪不得毛主席要我们组织合作社，原来合作社有这大的力量。”社员胡兴庭是富裕中农，原来准备要退社，丰收后，再不说退社的话了，他说：“如今我要永远留在社里。”
    现在，久丰一社已经订出1958年的增产规划，正在为使棉花提高到亩产皮棉二百四十斤而奋斗。
