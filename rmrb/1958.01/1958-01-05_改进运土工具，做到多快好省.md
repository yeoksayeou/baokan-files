    Improve Soil Transport Tools to Achieve More, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results
    Yu Ming
    Anhui Province has already completed its planned eight hundred million cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects and is now struggling to complete another eight hundred million cubic meters. Faced with such a large task, how to help farmers improve their tools, increase work efficiency, and achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results is a pressing issue in current water conservancy work. The leaders of the Anhui Provincial Party and government are vigorously advocating the improvement of water conservancy construction tools. In the southern suburbs of Hefei, experiments are being conducted on soil transport tools to replace the most burdensome labor. There are several types of tools here. One is called the windlass single-track skateboard soil transporter. This tool transports soil very quickly over a distance of 18 meters, on a steep slope with a height difference of 5 meters. The second tool is called the foot-operated double-track skateboard soil transporter, and its structure is roughly the same as the windlass single-track skateboard soil transporter. (Another tool is called the Liberation-style soil transporter. It is relatively large and complex in its construction, with a large transport volume and high efficiency. However, it is only suitable for larger projects.) These two soil transporters are simple and practical, and they also save materials and money, making them as easy to add as waterwheels. Their forms are also suited to the habits of farmers. Experiments have shown that climbing from the bottom of an 18-meter long gully with a height difference of 5 meters to the top of the levee, each person can only transport a little more than ten baskets of soil per hour (each basket weighing 110 jin), but using the aforementioned soil transporters, the efficiency is equivalent to an average of fifteen to seventeen baskets per person per hour, increasing soil transport efficiency by 50%-70%, and even more after proficiency and improvement. These two tools are not only highly efficient, but also have a wide range of applications, suitable for building small reservoirs and digging deep ditches and ponds. In addition, they can continue to be used in situations where there is a lot of mud at the bottom of the ditch and it is difficult for people to climb steep slopes after rain or snow.
    Improving and promoting improved tools is of great significance for accelerating water conservancy construction. Anhui Province has already organized cadres and farmers from counties near Hefei to visit, and also organized water conservancy cadres from various special districts to visit and study with carpenters and blacksmiths. It has also organized the responsible persons of various municipal party committees, the responsible persons of various departments and bureaus, and the responsible persons of various counties attending the Party Congress and cadre meetings to visit, calling on them to help farmers improve their tools and strive to support the construction of water conservancy.

    改进运土工具，做到多快好省
    于明
    安徽省已经完成了原订的兴修水利八亿土方工程的计划，现在又正在为再搞八亿土方而斗争。面对着这么大的任务，如何帮助农民改进工具，提高工作效率，做到又多又快又好又省，是当前水利工作中一个迫切问题。安徽省党政领导正在大力倡导改进兴修水利工具。合肥的南郊，正在试验着代替最笨重劳动的运土工具。这里有几种工具。一种叫做辘轳单轨滑板式运土器。这种工具在十八公尺长的距离中，在高差五公尺的陡坡上，运土速度很快。第二种工具叫做脚踏式双轨滑板式运土器，构造和辘轳单轨滑板式运土器大体相同。（另一种工具叫做解放式运土器。它比较庞大，装置也较复杂，运输量大，效率高。但只适用于较大的工程。）这两种运土器简单适用，也省料省钱，像添置水车一样容易。它们的形式也适合农民的习惯。试验表明，从十八公尺长、高差五公尺的沟底爬坡到堤顶，每小时每人只能运十筐多一点土（每筐一百一十斤），但用上述运土器，效率等于每人每小时平均十五筐到十七筐，提高运土效率50％—70％，在熟练及改进后还可提高。这两种工具不但效率大，而且适用的范围广，修小水库，挖深沟、深塘都适用。另外它可以在沟下烂泥很多、下雨下雪后人不容易爬陡坡的情况下照常施工。
    改进和推广改进工具，对于加速水利建设，有着重要意义。安徽省已经组织合肥附近各县的干部和农民去参观，又组织各专区水利干部带着木匠、铁匠去参观研究，还组织各地市委的负责人；各厅局的负责人及参加党代会、干部会的各县负责人前去参观，号召他们帮助农民改进工具，为支援建设水利而努力。
