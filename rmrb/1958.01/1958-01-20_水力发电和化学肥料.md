Hydropower and Chemical Fertilizers
    Cheng Xuemin
    China has little arable land and a large population, so increasing agricultural production mainly relies on increasing the unit area yield of farmland. Therefore, building water conservancy projects and developing chemical fertilizer production are extremely important tasks. Manufacturing chemical fertilizers requires a large amount of cheap electricity. China is rich in hydropower resources and has excellent conditions for building hydroelectric power stations; moreover, hydropower generation costs only one-third to one-seventh of thermal power, which is very beneficial to the development of the chemical fertilizer industry.
    According to the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) for 1956-1967, the national production of chemical fertilizers will be 5 million to 7 million tons in 1962, and 15 million tons in 1967. The increase in grain production from applying more chemical fertilizers to farmland is considerable. Each pound of ammonium sulfate nitrogen fertilizer can increase grain production by three pounds, and each pound of ammonium nitrate nitrogen fertilizer can increase grain production by five pounds. In other words, according to the above plan, due to increased application of chemical fertilizers, the nation can increase grain production by 40 billion to 60 billion jin in 1962, and 90 billion to 150 billion jin in 1967.
    The chemical fertilizer industry is an electricity-intensive industry. For example, using the water-gas method to produce nitrogen fertilizer requires about 500 to 900 kWh per ton (this is based on ammonium sulfate; if based on ammonium nitrate, it needs to be increased by about double); using the electrolysis of water method to produce nitrogen fertilizer requires about 3,700 kWh per ton; using electric furnaces to produce lime nitrogen fertilizer requires about 3,000 kWh per ton; using ordinary mechanical methods to produce low-efficiency phosphate fertilizer requires about 100 kWh per ton; using electrothermal methods to produce high-efficiency phosphate fertilizer requires about 1,000 to 2,500 kWh per ton.
    Taking the target of reaching 15 million tons of chemical fertilizer production in 1967 as an example, if a less power-intensive method is adopted, with an average power consumption of 600 kWh per ton, a total of 9 billion kWh will be needed, which is about one-half of China's total power generation in 1957. If a more power-intensive method is adopted, with an average power consumption of 3,500 kWh per ton, a total of 52.5 billion kWh will be needed, which is about three times China's total power generation in 1957. This shows the enormous power consumption of the chemical fertilizer industry. Therefore, we must seriously study the power supply problem of this industry.
    In the production of chemical fertilizers around the world, countries lacking coal deposits but rich in hydropower resources generally use hydropower and adopt more power-intensive manufacturing methods. Examples include Sweden, Norway, North Korea, and Japan. In countries with abundant coal but scarce hydropower resources, less power-intensive methods are used, and thermal power plants are used as power sources, such as in Britain. In terms of resource conditions, China has abundant hydropower resources and is not short of coal resources, so there is greater freedom in selection. However, China's hydropower resources are evenly distributed, and comprehensive development and construction of hydroelectric power stations are much cheaper than in foreign countries. The distribution of coal deposits is not very even, there are still many difficulties in regional balance and transportation, and the mining speed in the near future cannot keep up with the needs of development. Therefore, how China's chemical fertilizer industry can rely more on hydropower generation is a question worth studying.
    Furthermore, from the perspective of production costs, the manufacture of chemical fertilizers consumes a lot of electricity, and the price of electricity has a great impact on the cost of the products. The cost of chemical fertilizers must maintain a certain ratio with the price of grain. If the cost of chemical fertilizers is too high, it will reduce their economic value in use, affect their sales, and even affect the development of this industry. In Northeast China, due to the low power generation cost of the Fengman Hydropower Station, it is possible to supply the Jilin Fertilizer Plant with a large amount of cheap electricity, which greatly reduces the manufacturing cost of fertilizers. This makes it possible to supply the needs of farmers in large quantities. If thermal power is used, the cost of fertilizer manufactured will inevitably be several times more expensive due to the high cost of power generation, and sometimes even make it not worthwhile to apply more fertilizer.
    Taking 3,500 kWh of electricity consumption per ton of nitrogen fertilizer as an example, each jin of nitrogen fertilizer requires 1.7 kWh of electricity. And taking each jin of nitrogen fertilizer to increase grain production by 3 to 5 jin as an example, each kWh of electricity can increase grain production by 2 to 3 jin. When using the electrolysis of water method, in addition to air and water, the most important raw material is actually a large amount of cheap hydropower. This kind of raw material will never run out. Therefore, the saying "using one kWh of hydropower to exchange for two to three jin of grain" cannot be considered an exaggeration. The cost of hydropower generation is only 4 to 8 fen per kWh, which is very cheap to exchange for grain.
    Using hydropower and electrolysis of water to manufacture chemical fertilizers can also produce large amounts of oxygen and heavy water. Oxygen is increasingly used in industry, and heavy water is an important material for the atomic energy industry. The value of these two by-products should not be ignored.
    In terms of investment, using hydropower and power-intensive methods for production, the investment in power stations per ton of nitrogen fertilizer may be larger. However, the investment in the nitrogen fertilizer plant itself is reduced. Conversely, using thermal power plants and less power-intensive methods for production, the investment in power stations per ton of nitrogen fertilizer may be less, but the investment in the nitrogen fertilizer plant itself will be more. In addition, from the perspective of the country's overall economic development, it is also necessary to consider the coal mine investment required to increase coal consumption, as well as the railway investment required to transport this coal. Taking these factors into consideration, the comprehensive investment required to produce nitrogen fertilizer using hydropower is not necessarily much more expensive than the comprehensive investment required to produce nitrogen fertilizer using thermal power. In areas with excellent hydropower resources, the difference between the two investments may not be large.
    Some people worry that China's need for chemical fertilizers is very huge, and if more power-intensive methods are used to manufacture fertilizers, will it cause excessive tension in power resources? The following estimates can be made: China's total hydropower reserves are about 544 million kW, with an annual power generation of about 4,770 billion kWh. If 1% of this number is developed, 47.7 billion kWh of hydropower can be obtained. This electricity can be used to manufacture about 14 million tons of fertilizer, which can increase grain production by 95 billion to 140 billion jin. It can be seen that China's abundant hydropower resources are more than sufficient to solve the power supply for China's fertilizer industry.
    Currently, there is a great concern about building hydropower stations, which is the fear that reservoirs will submerge farmland and reduce agricultural production. This issue should indeed be carefully considered. However, if hydropower is used to produce fertilizer, the following comparison can also be made: If each kilowatt submerges one mu of land (in fact, the submergence losses of many hydropower stations are far less than this number), the annual reduction in grain production is about 500 jin; but each kilowatt generates about 5,000 kWh of electricity per year, which can increase grain production by 10,000 jin to 15,000 jin, with a difference of 20 to 30 times. Of course, in fact, we cannot use this as a reason to disregard the submergence losses of reservoirs. The problem of reservoir submergence should always be reduced as much as possible. However, the positive significance of hydropower should also be fully estimated, especially since the production of certain chemical fertilizers does not necessarily require continuous power supply throughout the year, and intermittent production can be considered. In this way, the requirements for reservoir regulation of hydropower stations can be greatly reduced, which means that the reservoir capacity can be reduced, thereby reducing submergence losses and also reducing the cost of hydropower stations. The expenses increased by fertilizer factories due to intermittent production can be compensated by the hydropower sector with preferential electricity prices. This is a method that is beneficial to all parties.
    China's hydropower resources are distributed throughout the country. The major rivers have the conditions for building large-scale hydropower stations, and the tributaries have the conditions for building small and medium-sized hydropower stations. According to China's current financial situation, building more small and medium-sized hydropower stations can not only meet the electricity requirements of various small and medium-sized light and heavy industries, but also promote the development of the fertilizer industry. According to the experience of hydropower construction during the First Five-Year Plan, in general, as long as the survey and design work of small and medium-sized hydropower stations is done well, the construction time is only about two and a half years, and all electromechanical equipment can be manufactured by ourselves. Although the cost of hydropower stations is more expensive than that of thermal power stations, since it does not require burning coal and the management and operating costs are relatively low, the initial extra investment can generally be saved back in about three years, and cheap electricity can be obtained for a long time thereafter. This is the best way to develop the fertilizer industry. Therefore, the relationship between hydropower generation and chemical fertilizers and related investment issues are worth studying by the relevant departments of the central and local governments.

    水力发电和化学肥料
    程学敏
    我国耕地少、人口多，农业的增产的主要靠增加农田的单位面积产量。因而兴修水利和发展化学肥料生产就成十分重要的工作。制造化学肥料需要大量廉价的电力。我国水力资源丰富，有优越的建设水电站的条件；而且水力发电成本仅为火电的三分之一至七分之一，对发展化学肥料工业十分有利。
    根据1956—1967年全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），1962年全国将生产化学肥料五百至七百万吨，1967年将生产化学肥料一千五百万吨。农田增施化学肥料所能增产的粮食是很可观的，每斤硫酸氨氮肥可增产粮食三斤，每斤硝酸氨氮肥可增产粮食五斤。也就是说，按照上述计划，由于增施化学肥料，1962年全国可增产粮食四百至六百亿斤，1967年全国可增产粮食九百至一千五百亿斤。
    化学肥料工业是一种耗电较多的工业。如用水煤气法制造氮肥，每吨约需电五百至九百度（这是按硫酸氨计，如按硝酸氨计，还要增加约一倍）；用电解水法制造氮肥，每吨约需电三千七百度；用电炉制造石灰氮肥，每吨约需电三千度；用普通机械法制造低效磷肥，每吨约需电一百度；用电热法制造高效磷肥每吨约需电一千至二千五百度。
    以1967年要求达到化学肥料产量一千五百万吨计算，如采用耗电较少的方法，每吨平均耗电六百度，共需电九十亿度，约为我国1957年全国发电量的二分之一。如采用耗电较多的方法，以每吨平均耗电三千五百度计，则共需电五百二十五亿度，约为我国1957年全国发电量的三倍。由此可以看出化学肥料工业耗电量的巨大。因而我们必需十分郑重地来研究这一工业的供电问题。
    世界各国化学肥料的生产，大体上在煤藏缺乏而水力资源丰富的国家都利用水电，并采用耗电较多的制造方法。例如瑞典、挪威、朝鲜、日本等。在煤炭较多而水力资源贫乏的国家，则采用耗电少的方法，并用热电站为电源，如英国。就资源条件而言，我国水力资源既十分丰富，煤炭资源也并不缺乏，在选择上可以有较大的自由。但是我国水力资源分布均匀，可以综合开发建设水电站造价比外国低廉得多。而煤藏的分布则不很均匀，地区平衡和运输上还有不少困难，而且在最近一定时间内开采速度还跟不上需要的发展。所以我国的化学肥料工业如何较多依靠水力发电是一个很值得研究的问题。
    再从生产成本方面来讲，制造化学肥料耗电较多，电价的高低对产品的成本有很大的影响。而化学肥料的成本又必须与粮食价格保持一定的比例，如果化学肥料成本太高，就会降低其使用的经济价值，影响它的销路，甚至影响到这一工业的发展。我国东北由于丰满水电站的发电成本低廉，有条件供应吉林肥料厂以大量廉价的电力，因而使肥料的制造成本大大降低。这样才能大量供应农民的需要。如果用火电，由于发电成本贵，由此制造的肥料成本势必也要贵好几倍，有时甚至使得增施肥料并不上算。
    以每一吨氮肥耗电三千五百度计，每斤氮肥需电一点七度。又以每斤氮肥可增产粮食三至五斤计，每一度电即可增产粮食二至三斤。在使用水电解法时，除了空气和水以外，实际上最主要的原料即是大量廉价的水力电。这一种原料又是永远用不完的。所以“用一度水电换二斤到三斤粮食”的说法，不能认为是夸张的。水力发电的成本不过每度四厘到八厘，用此来换粮食是非常便宜的。
    利用水电和电解水制造化肥的方法，还可以生产大量的氧气和重水。氧气在工业上的用途日益增大，重水是原子能工业的重要材料，这两种副产品的价值是不应忽视的。
    在投资方面，利用水电并用耗电多的方法来进行生产，每吨氮肥所需的电站投资可能要大一些。但是氮肥工厂本身的投资却有所减少。与此相反，利用热电站并用耗电少的方法来进行生产，每吨氮肥所需的电站投资可能少一些，但是氮肥工厂本身的投资却要多一些。此外，从国家全面的经济发展看，还必须考虑到为增加煤炭用量而增加的煤矿投资，以及为运输这些煤炭所需的铁路投资。把这些因素综合起来考虑，则利用水电生产氮肥所需的综合投资不一定比利用热电生产氮肥所需的综合投资贵许多。在水力资源优越的地方，这两者的投资可能相差不大。
    有人担心，我国化学肥料的需要量十分巨大，制造化肥如果多用耗电多的方法，是否会造成动力资源的过分紧张？对此可作如下估算：我国水力资源的全部蕴藏量约为五亿四千四百万瓩，年发电量约为四万七千七百亿度。如果开发此数的1％，即可得到水力电四百七十七亿度，拿这些电可以制造化肥约一千四百万吨，可以增产粮食九百五十亿斤到一千四百亿斤。由此可见，以我国丰富的水力资源来解决我国的化肥工业的供电是绰有余裕的。
    目前对于建设水电站有一个很大顾虑，就是害怕水库淹没农田，减少农业生产。这一问题确是应当慎重考虑的。但如利用水电来生产肥料时，也可作如下的比较：如以每一瓩淹地一亩计（事实上许多水电站的淹没损失都远比这数字为少），每年减产粮食约为五百斤；但每一瓩每年发电约五千度，即可增产粮食一万斤至一万五千斤，其间相差数为二十至三十倍。当然，事实上我们不能以此作为不顾水库淹没损失的理由。水库淹没的问题总是应当尽量设法来减少的。但水电的积极意义也应当予以充分的估计，特别是某些化学肥料的生产不一定要求全年连续供电，而可以考虑间断性的生产。这样，对于水电站的水库调节的要求就可以大大降低，也就是可以减少水库容量，从而减少淹没损失，并且也可降低水电站的造价。肥料工厂由于间断性生产所增加的支出，可以由水电方面以优待的电价来予以补偿。这是一种对各方面都有利的办法。
    我国的水力资源遍布全国，大江大河有建设大型水电站的条件，支流有建设中小型水电站的条件。按照我国目前资金的情况，多建一些中小型的水电站，既可供应各种中小型轻重工业用电的要求，又能促进肥料工业的发展。根据第一个五年计划水电建设的经验，一般中小型水电站只要勘测设计工作做好了，施工时间不过二年半左右，所有机电设备也都可以自己制造。水电站的造价虽然要比火电站贵一些，但由于它不用烧煤，管理及运行费用比较省，初期所多花的投资，一般在三年左右可以节省回来，以后长期可以得到廉价的电力。这是发展肥料工业最好的办法。因此，关于水力发电和化学肥料的关系问题及其有关的投资等问题，很值得中央和地方的有关部门展开研究。
