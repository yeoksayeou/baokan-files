Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 8th: The "Neues Deutschland" newspaper reported on January 7th about a secret plan for West Germany, France, and Italy to jointly manufacture atomic weapons.

The newspaper stated: Tense diplomatic, economic, and military activities have taken place between Bonn, Rome, and Paris to realize this plan. West German political figures pointed out that someone is clearly intending to create a "fait accompli" before replying to Bulganin's letter.

The report said: Before the NATO Paris meeting, the main content of the negotiations between West German Foreign Minister Brentano and Italian Foreign Minister Pella was this secret plan. Brentano interrupted his negotiations in Rome and rushed to Washington to negotiate with Dulles, with the aim of trying to dispel certain opposition from the Italian side. West German Defense Minister Strauss later went to Rome to agree with the Italian military authorities on specific technical matters regarding the joint manufacture of atomic weapons. France has also joined this bilateral agreement.

At the same time, according to the West German "Frankfurter Abendpost" newspaper: A "Bonn-Paris-Rome arms triangle" is beginning to emerge in Western Europe. The newspaper also mentioned the activities of the "Franco-(West) German Ballistics Institute" in Saint-Louis (Alsace) and the "Franco-(West) German joint research work on tactical rocket weapons" at the Colomb-Béchar proving ground in Algeria. The newspaper reported that West Germany and France will begin joint production of tactical rockets in the near future, based on the results of the tests conducted in Colomb-Béchar.

    西德、法、意三国在搞秘密计划
    筹划联合制造原子武器
    据新华社8日讯　柏林消息：“新德意志报”7日报道了关于西德、法国和意大利三国联合制造原子武器的秘密计划的消息。
    这家报纸说：波恩、罗马和巴黎之间曾经为实现这个计划进行了紧张的外交、经济和军事活动。西德政界人士指出，有人显然打算在答复布尔加宁信件之前先造成“既成事实”。
    消息说：在北大西洋集团巴黎会议之前，西德外交部长勃伦塔诺和意大利外交部长贝拉谈判的主要内容就是这个秘密计划。勃伦塔诺中断了他在罗马的谈判而赶到华盛顿去同杜勒斯谈判，其目的在于设法打消意大利方面的某些反对。西德国防部长施特劳斯后来又到罗马去同意大利军事当局议定了关于联合制造原子武器的技术方面的具体事项。法国也已经参加了这个双边协议。
    同时，据西德“法兰克福晚报”报道：西欧正在开始出现一个“波恩—巴黎—罗马的军备三角地带”。这家报纸还提到圣路易（艾勒扎斯）“法、（西）德弹道研究所”的活动以及在阿尔及利亚科隆培沙试验场的“法、（西）德两国关于战术火箭武器的联合研究工作”。报纸报道，西德和法国将根据两国在科隆培沙所进行的试验的结果，在最近将来开始联合生产战术火箭。
