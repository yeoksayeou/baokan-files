Cannot Let the Dead Always Drag Down the Living
——Reflections on Reading "Tentatively Advocating Flat and Deep Burial"
　　Yang Qi

    After reading Mr. Huang Yanpei’s article "Tentatively Advocating Flat and Deep Burial" published in the "People's Daily" on January 11, I strongly agree with this proposal.

    I don't know when people started occupying land and building mounds after death. Judging from it, it can be asserted that it must have been in an era when land was abundant and people were scarce. In modern times, more and more people have opposed this burial method, partly because people's natural science knowledge has improved, and partly because people are becoming denser and arable land is becoming more precious. A few years ago, the national average was about three mu of land per person; now, it is only more than two mu of land per person; in many places, the average is only a few fen of land per person. Of course, we believe that this problem cannot stump us. The more labor we have, the more we can increase the yield per unit area. However, if the increased yield per unit area is offset by the reduced yield due to the occupation of arable land, wouldn't it be a pity! Going to the suburbs, to the fields, you can see one earth mound after another, even patches of cemeteries, overgrown with weeds and thorns; and on the land around them, good crops are growing. These crops must also be greatly dissatisfied with the fact that the good land is occupied by weeds and thorns, right?

    Of course, we must also reclaim wasteland and strive to expand the area of arable land. However, if pieces of existing arable land are occupied by tombs, one day the expanded area of arable land will not be able to compensate for the area of arable land occupied year by year.

    According to Lu Xun, this is called "the dead dragging down the living." To occupy a piece of land after death and make people plant less grain and cotton, wouldn't it be equivalent to not allowing the living to live better? We are militant materialists and do not believe in the existence of a soul after death. I think, even if the dead have spirits, they should be uneasy in this situation, right? Furthermore, even those who believe in the existence of the soul, such as Christians, don't many of them habitually practice cremation?

    In fact, only a very few ancient tombs have survived to this day; most of the mounds, after some years, have not been submerged and disappeared after several wind and rains? Since the tombs of our ancestors can be dispensed with, why should the newly deceased still need to be sealed and occupy land?

    I also strongly agree with the opinion that "even coffins can be dispensed with." If we understand how scarce wood is in our country, if we understand how much our construction work—the foundation of eternal happiness—needs wood, if we understand how much the lack of wood will hinder our project of building a ten-thousand-year happy mansion, we will understand how regrettable it is to bury so much good wood in the ground—not to mention how much labor it takes to make coffins.

    The broad masses of working people, even in the past, may not have wholeheartedly agreed that people should occupy a piece of good land after death, let alone agree to "lavish funerals," burying a large amount of good wood, good clothes, etc. underground, letting them rot with the dead. In fact, in ancient times, there were also debates about "lavish funerals" and "simple funerals." Those who advocated "lavish funerals" finally prevailed, which was determined by the social and historical conditions at that time. The feudal rulers needed to use the "prestige" of the dead to rule the living, and needed to use tombs to maintain the feudal "ethical code." Not striving for "lavish funerals" was disrespectful to the dead, unfilial, and inhumane, which has been a dominant "public opinion" and "custom" for a long time. This public opinion and custom were essentially created by the feudal rulers and served the feudal rulers. Under their control, feudal rulers could also show off their power and seize the opportunity to extract more blood and sweat from the laborers when people died; the number of laborers who were ruined by the death of a family member was countless. What happened after bankruptcy? Only more cruel exploitation. Many laborers had no place to stand when alive and no place to bury when dead under cruel exploitation and oppression, and they were also given the evil epithet of "doing evil in their previous life, such is their fate." The bloody sins of many exploiters were covered up by the nonsense that "the ancestral tombs have good Feng Shui."

    Or it is said that sealing a mound and erecting a stone tablet is to express gratitude and commemoration to the dead, and also to comfort and encourage the living. For some people who have made special contributions to the people, doing so is naturally right, and the people will agree to do so. However, there will certainly not be many such people. If we want to engage in egalitarianism on this issue, it is really unnecessary. In fact, if a person has done many good things for the people and future generations during his lifetime, people will naturally remember him forever. If a person lives only to satisfy his private desires, even planning for "posthumous glory," such a person is of no benefit to the people when alive. No matter how high and large the mound is sealed after death, people will quickly forget him, not to mention respecting him. Don't we often say that some martyrs live in the hearts of the people? Isn't living forever in the hearts of the people ten thousand times better than being put in a "steamed bun" as "steamed bun filling"!

    As far as I know, many areas in the North actually practice deep burial, with the grave pits dug quite deep. In these areas, there is no need to dig out the dead and bury them deeper. Just persuading people and removing the mounds will do. In the future, when burying again, it is also sufficient to not seal the mounds. What if the people related to the dead don't understand? Naturally, don't force them. We are revolutionaries and want to change customs. However, changing customs is definitely not something that can be done by forced orders.

    不能老让死的拖着活的
    ——读“试倡平地深葬”有感
  　杨弃
    读了1月11日“人民日报”载黄炎培先生“试倡平地深葬”一文，对此议甚为赞同。
    我不知道，人死了要占一块地、封一个堆，这是从何年何月开始的。揣度起来，可以断言，那一定是地广而人还很稀
  的时代。近代越来越多的人对这种埋葬方式提出反对的意见，一方面是因为人们的自然科学知识提高了，一方面也是因为人越来越稠、耕地越来越觉可贵了。几年以前，全国平均每人有三亩地左右；现在，平均每人只有二亩多地了；在许多地方，每人平均不过几分地。当然，我们相信，这个问题难不倒我们。劳动力越多，越能提高单位面积产量。可是，如果提高的单位面积产量却因耕地被占去而减少的产量抵销了，岂不可惜！到郊外去，到田间去，可以看到一个一个的土堆，甚至成片成片的坟茔，上面长满了荒草荆棘；而在它们四周的土地，生长着的却是好庄稼。这些庄稼，也要为那些好好的土地被荒草荆棘占据着而大抱不平吧？
    当然，我们还要开荒，还要力求扩大耕地面积。可是，现有的耕地一片一片被坟墓占去，总有一天，扩大的耕地面积还抵不上逐年被占去的耕地面积。
    按照鲁迅的说法，这叫做“死的拖着活的”。死了还要占一块地，还要让人少种一些粮棉，岂不等于不让活着的人们更好地生活？我们是战斗的唯物主义者，是不相信人死了还有灵魂之说的。我想，即使死者有灵，那魂灵在这情况之下也该是难以安宁的吧？再说，就是相信灵魂之说的人们，如基督教徒，不也有相当多的人是习惯实行火葬的吗？
    实际上，古代的坟墓，能留存到今天的，也是极少数；绝大多数坟堆，过了一些年代，还不是几经风雨就堙没无存了？既然老祖先的坟墓都可以不要，新近死去的人又何必还要封堆占地？
    我也十分赞成“连棺槨都可以省掉”的意见。如果了解我国的木材是多么缺乏，如果了解我们的建设事业——千秋万代的幸福的根基是多么需要木材，如果了解木材的不足会使我们建设万年幸福大厦的工程受多少阻碍，就会了解把那么多那么好的木材埋到地下去是多么可惜——更不要说为了制造棺材要耗费多少劳动力了。
    广大劳动群众，即使在过去的年代，也未必都衷心赞成人死了还要占去一块好地，更未必赞成“厚葬”，把大量好木材、好衣服等等埋到地下，让它们同死去的人一起腐烂。其实，在古代，也发生过“厚葬”和“薄葬”的争论。主张“厚葬”的人终于占了优势，那是当时的社会历史条件决定的。封建统治者需要借死人的“威风”来统治活人，需要用坟墓来维系封建的“纲常”。不力求“厚葬”就是对死者不敬、不孝，不近人情，这在久远的年代里已经是一种占支配地位的“舆论”和“风习”。这舆论和风习实质上是封建统治者造成，为封建统治者服务的。在它们支配下，封建统治者死了人也可以大摆威风、乘机额外地榨取劳动者更多的血汗；劳动者因死了一口人而倾家破产者却比比皆是。破产之后呢？只有受更残酷的压榨。许多劳动者在残酷的剥削压迫下生无立锥之地，死无葬身之地，还要被加上“前生作孽，命该如此”的恶谥。许多剥削者的血腥的罪恶，却被“祖先的坟茔风水好”的胡言乱语掩盖起来了。
    或者说，封起一个土堆，立上一个石碑，是为了表示对死者的感恩和纪念，也是为了对生者的安慰和激励。对一些对人民有特殊功勋的人，这样做自然也是应该的，人民群众也会同意这样做。可是，这样的人决不会很多。如果在这个问题上也要闹一闹平均主义，实在大可不必。其实，一个人，生前为人民、为后代做了许多好事，人们自然会永远纪念着他。如果一个人活着一心为了满足私欲，连死后的“哀荣”也预谋不已，这样的人，活着对人民没什么好处，死了把坟堆封得再高再大，人们还是会很快地忘记他，自然更提不到尊敬他。我们不常说一些先烈活在人们心里吗？永远活在人们心里，岂不比放在土馒头里做“馒头馅”要好千万倍！
    据我了解，北方许多地区，实际上实行的就是深葬，墓穴挖得相当深。这些地区，用不着把死者挖出再深埋，只要说通了人们的思想，把坟堆铲去就可以了。以后再葬，不封土堆也就可以了。如果同死者有关的人思想不通呢？自然不要强迫。我们是革命者，要做移风易俗的事情。可是，移风易俗决不是用强迫命令的办法可以办好的事情。
