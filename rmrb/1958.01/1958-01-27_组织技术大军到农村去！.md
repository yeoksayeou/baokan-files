Organize a Technical Contingent to Go to the Countryside!
By a Staff Commentator

	Organizing a technical contingent to go to the countryside to impart the skills of using and repairing agricultural machinery and new-style farm tools is a glorious and arduous task facing the Chinese working class.
	During the First Five-Year Plan, we supplied the countryside with over 500,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery and over 4.68 million pieces of new-style farm tools. This year, another 500,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery and 1.4 million new-style farm tools will be sent to the countryside. To teach farmers how to use these machines and new-style farm tools, and to solve the problem of regular maintenance and repair, a considerable number of technicians and skilled workers must go to the countryside as instructors and key personnel. In the past, this work was not done well enough, so that some machines and new-style farm tools were damaged and could not be repaired, and some were left idle because the farmers did not know how to use them. We must quickly overcome this shortcoming and speed up the work of bringing technology to the countryside as soon as possible.
	Many places have already begun to address this issue. The practice of Shanxi Province, reported in today's newspaper, of organizing a technical contingent of nearly a thousand people to go to the countryside for a concentrated effort to repair and provide technical instruction, is one approach. The Tianjin Tractor Factory sending people to the countryside to run training classes is another. The dispatch of more than six hundred drivers and other technically skilled people by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Transportation and Shipping to support the countryside, as reported on the 23rd, is yet another approach. These comrades who go to the countryside are active supporters of the high tide of agricultural production and are the advance team in helping the countryside carry out technical revolution. The farmers warmly welcome them, thank them, and praise them as worthy of being called "elder brothers from the working class." This is the best reward they can receive. May they persevere and strive to make greater contributions to increased agricultural production, so as not to disappoint the farmers' expectations.
	However, some comrades do not see it this way. They feel that it is not one's proper occupation and a waste of talent for technically skilled people to go to work in the countryside. The factory is only responsible for manufacturing; once the goods are sold, their responsibility is over; as for use and repair, that is the farmers' own business. These comrades do not understand the great significance of "machines going to the countryside," and do not understand that "technology going to the countryside along with the machines" is a historical task of the working class. Machines going to the countryside is not just selling ordinary commodities to the countryside. It is the beginning of technically transforming agriculture and putting it on the path of modernization; it is the beginning of realizing communism and narrowing and eliminating the differences between town and country. To transform the backward agriculture that has been plowing with wooden plows and irrigating with old oxcarts for thousands of years into using machines for plowing and irrigation; to let farmers sit on tractors and farm women sit beside electric mills, working as if they were workers at their own machines; this is the lofty ideal of the working class. To realize this ideal, to let the machines produced by one's own factory play their role in production as soon as possible, to become the first batch of submachine guns in the agricultural technical revolution, this is a task of paramount importance. How can it be said that it is a matter that has nothing to do with oneself? To realize this ideal, to go to the countryside first and take on the role of the first batch of soldiers to complete this great historical task, this is the most glorious work. How can it be said that it is not one's proper occupation and a waste of talent?
	The farmers of Shanxi praise the technical workers and technicians for going to the countryside to help repair and maintain agricultural machinery as "a new form of worker-peasant alliance." This is very accurate. The socialist revolution on our country's economic front has already achieved a great victory, and the revolution on the political and ideological fronts has also achieved preliminary success. In the future, the working class will use even greater strength to lead the people of the whole country to march towards technology and change the face of our great nature. In order to achieve this great goal, comrades in the industrial sector should enthusiastically respond to the call of our farmer brothers, send their best representatives to the countryside, labor side by side with the farmers, share hardships and joys together. In this way, the alliance of the working class and the peasant class, the pillars of our motherland, will become increasingly strong and consolidated.

    组织技术大军到农村去！
    本报评论员
    组织技术大军到农村去，传授使用和修理农业机械和新式农具的本领，这是我国工人阶级面临的一项光荣而繁重的任务。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我们给农村输送了五十多万马力的排灌机械和四百六十八万多件新式农具。今年又将有五十万马力的排灌机械和一百四十万部新式农具下乡。这些机械和新式农具，要教会农民使用，并且要解决经常性的修配问题，就得要有一批相当数量的技术工人和技术人员到农村去，当师傅，作骨干。过去这个工作做得不够好，以致有一部分机器和新式农具损坏了没法修理，有一部分因为农民不会使用而闲置起来。这个缺点我们要迅速克服，尽快地把技术下乡的工作赶上去。
    有不少地方已经在着手解决这个问题。今天本报登载的山西省组织近千人的技术大军下乡突击修配和教技术，是一种做法。天津拖拉机制造厂派人到农村去开办训练班，也是一种做法。23日登载的江苏交通航运厅抽调六百多个驾驶员等懂技术的人去支援农村，这又是一种做法。这些到农村去的同志，都是农业生产高潮的积极支持者，是帮助农村进行技术革命的先遣队。农民们热情地欢迎他们，感谢他们，赞扬他们不愧为“工人老大哥”。这是他们得到的最好的酬报，愿他们坚持不懈，力求为农业增产作出更大的贡献，以不负农民的期望。
    但是，有些同志却不是这样。他们觉得懂技术的人到农村去工作，是不务正业，是浪费人材。工厂只是管制造的，货物卖出门，自己的责任就完了；至于使用和修理，那是农民自己的事。这些同志没有了解“机器下乡”这件事的伟大意义，没有了解，“技术随着机器下乡”，这是工人阶级的一个历史任务。机器下乡，这不是向农村销售一般的商品。这是对农业进行技术改造，把农业引上现代化轨道的开始；是实现共产主义，缩小和消灭城乡差别的开始。把几千年来用木犁耕田、老牛车水的落后的农业，变成用机器耕田、机器浇地；让农民坐在拖拉机上，农妇坐在电磨旁边，就像工人在自己的机器上一样地劳动；这是工人阶级崇高的理想。去实现这个理想，让自己工厂出产的机器尽快在生产中发挥效用，成为农业技术革命的第一批冲锋枪，这是再重要不过的任务了，怎么能说它是与己无关的事呢？去实现这个理想，首先到农村中去，担当完成这个伟大历史任务的第一批战士，这是再光荣不过的工作了，怎么能说它是不务正业、浪费人材呢？
    山西的农民赞扬技术工人和技术人员下乡帮助修配农业机械是“工农联盟的新形式”。这句话说得十分确切。我国经济战线上的社会主义革命已经取得了伟大的胜利，政治战线和思想战线上的革命也已取得了初步的成就，今后，工人阶级还将要用更大的力量来领导全国人民向技术进军，改变我国大自然的面貌。为了实现这个伟大的目标，工业部门的同志们应该踊跃响应农民兄弟的召唤，把自己最优秀的代表派到农村去，同农民肩并肩地劳动，共艰辛，也共喜悦。这样，我们祖国的支柱——工人阶级和农民阶级的联盟，将变得日益坚强，日益巩固。
