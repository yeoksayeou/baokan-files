    Heartbreaking

    Employees of the jointly state-private owned Yongli Jiuda Chemical Industry Company in Dagukou have exposed many wasteful phenomena within the enterprise. According to the materials already revealed, last year alone, waste caused by poor management amounted to 600,000 yuan, and over 1 million yuan of capital was tied up. The main raw material of this factory, salt, was left unmanaged, exposed to wind and rain, resulting in a loss of 4,200 tons last year alone.

    令人痛心
    公私合营永利久大化学工业公司沽厂职工，揭发出企业中的许多浪费现象。根据已揭发的材料计算：去年这个厂仅因管理不善而造成的浪费就有六十万元，积压资金一百多万元。这个厂的主要原料——盐，因无专人管理，任凭风吹雨淋，仅去年就损失了四千二百吨。
    上图：任凭风吹雨打的盐堆。
