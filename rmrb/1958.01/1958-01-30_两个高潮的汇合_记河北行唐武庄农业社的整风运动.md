The Convergence of Two High Tides
——A Record of the Rectification Campaign in the Wuzhuang Agricultural Cooperative, Xingtang, Hebei
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhu Cheng

　　“Production and rectification are contradictory,” “To carry out rectification, production must be stopped.” This was the view of the cadres of the Wuzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Xingtang County, Hebei Province, at the beginning of the rectification campaign. However, the facts are exactly the opposite of their assertion. The deeper the rectification goes, the higher the enthusiasm of the members for labor. After the two stages of extensive airing of views and focused rectification, the labor attendance rate of the entire cooperative has increased from 80% to over 100%—even many auxiliary laborers in the members' families have been put into the cooperative's production. Currently, a small reservoir being built by the members, which can irrigate more than 430 mu of land, is nearing completion. In addition, a large amount of soil for padding has been hauled back, and work has begun on digging fish-scale pits on the hillside in preparation for planting trees in the spring.

　　The rectification campaign in this cooperative was led by the working group of the Xingtang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. How did they resolve the “contradiction” between production and rectification and promote the mutual promotion of the two high tides?

　　Relieving the Cadres' Worries

　　The Wuzhuang Agricultural Cooperative is a mountainous agricultural cooperative composed of 184 peasant households. When the county committee working group came to the cooperative on November 20 last year, the winter production in the cooperative had not yet started, and about 65% of the labor force was idle at home. A small reservoir that had begun construction in October progressed very slowly due to the small number of people participating in the construction. In response to this situation, the working group adopted the method of mobilizing cadres and members to extensively air their views, discussing the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), formulating production plans, and inspiring people's enthusiasm for labor with the prospect of happiness; at the same time, they also calculated work, time, and labor, and arranged the current production. In this way, after seven or eight days of work, by the end of November, the labor attendance rate of the entire cooperative had skyrocketed to over 80%. More than 100 women, who had never gone out in winter in the past, also came out and planted 20,000 locust trees on the hillside. In addition to working hard day and night on agricultural tasks such as hauling soil for padding and sending manure, which they did not do in winter in previous years, male members also flocked to the reservoir construction site.

　　A preliminary production high tide was formed. At the end of November, the working group and the village branch studied and decided to start rectification. Cadres led members in production during the day and launched extensive airing of views in the evening. However, at the airing of views meetings in each production team, the cadres' enthusiasm for encouraging members to air their views was insufficient, and they appeared very depressed. Therefore, 70% of the members attending the meeting did not speak, but looked at each other, and many people dozed off while sitting. Accordingly, 17 of the 20 party member cadres reported to the working group: rectification and production were “contradictory,” “After working all day, where do we get the energy to attend meetings at night?” Wang Shixin, deputy secretary of the branch and deputy director of the agricultural cooperative, said: “To carry out rectification, the reservoir construction must be stopped!”

　　Extensive airing of views, exposing and revealing problems, is the first hurdle in determining the quality of rectification. How can it be done if people don't express their opinions? The working group convened a meeting of the village branch committee to study the reasons why airing of views was not working. The branch committee members expressed their innermost thoughts and also reflected the ideological situation of the cadres and the masses. They said that the reason why airing of views was not working at night was not because they were too tired and had no energy. The cadres mainly had one fear: that their personal ideological and work style shortcomings and mistakes would be exposed by the members and criticized and punished. The masses mainly had four fears: fear of offending people; fear of retaliation; fear that their opinions would not be effective; and fear of being struggled against if they said something wrong. The working group and the branch committee studied and concluded that the key issue was that the cadres were afraid of “getting burned.” Once this concern was eliminated, mobilizing the masses to extensively air their views and promptly expressing their attitude to accept the members' correct criticisms would naturally eliminate the members' concerns. Accordingly, in the early days of December, the working group assisted the branch committee in holding several meetings of party member cadres above the level of production team leader and party member meetings in succession, repeatedly stating the significance of rectification, announcing the party's policies towards cadres in rectification, pointing out the correct attitude that party member cadres should adopt in rectification, and enlightening them to consciously participate in rectification. In this way, the consciousness of the vast majority of party member cadres was raised, and at a party member cadre meeting on the evening of December 3, airing of views naturally unfolded. The 11 people, including the branch secretary and cooperative director, who had never criticized each other, made 34 suggestions to each other. Wang Shixin, deputy secretary of the branch and deputy director of the agricultural cooperative, examined his commandist style and expressed that he would mobilize the members to give him more opinions. Li Shaokai (party member), the cooperative director who advocated concealing production and private distribution, examined his capitalist ideas and resolved to improve his thinking in rectification.

　　After the party member cadres' thinking was straightened out, the branch committee and the cooperative management committee studied and convened a general meeting of all members. At the meeting, in addition to the main cadres making preliminary examinations of their shortcomings in thinking and work style and encouraging members to boldly air their views, they also accepted some correct opinions aired by the members during the discussion of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and announced the correction of a batch of issues: cooperative cadres immediately participated in production and worked together with the members; the method of fixed scores and fixed records and unequal pay for equal work for men and women was changed at the reservoir construction site, and a quota-based remuneration system was implemented; accepting the members' opinions, taking advantage of the fact that the ground had not yet frozen, a concentrated effort was immediately made to plow the winter fallow land that should be cultivated. In this way, the vast number of members' enthusiasm for airing their views suddenly increased. Members Yang Xiaoche and Yang Naozi, etc., made many suggestions to Wang Shixin and others at the meeting. In the past, the fifth production team had held several meetings in the evening, and the members had only made seven suggestions in total. On the evening of the day the general meeting of all members was held, one meeting alone aired 32 suggestions. In particular, timely rectification powerfully promoted the production at that time. After the members' meeting, the labor attendance rate of the entire cooperative increased to over 90%. At the reservoir construction site, labor efficiency increased threefold due to the implementation of contract work quotas. The situation where members warmed their hands by pounding the earth changed, and people took off their cotton clothes and were still sweating from work. In the past, member Zhao Mazi could only dig five carts of soil a day, but after the implementation of quotas, he dug more than ten carts of soil a day.

　　Airing and Rectifying Simultaneously Boosts Enthusiasm

　　After the cadres changed from passive to active in rectification, they put forward many methods for combining production and rectification. In general, in addition to leading members in production during the day and holding meetings at night, different airing of views times were arranged for different people. For example, the twenty-odd feeders had to feed the livestock at night and prepare feed in the afternoon, so they were organized to hold meetings in the morning when they were relatively free. In order to solve the problem that it was inconvenient for some elderly people and women with many children to attend airing of views meetings at night, the branch mobilized 69 party and league members as scribes to visit them and write more than 360 written opinions for them, using all available time. In the division of leadership, it was determined that a group of cadres would be in charge of production, and a group of cadres would be in charge of rectification. The cadres in charge of rectification summarized and analyzed the opinions put forward by the members every day so that they could improve while airing their views.

　　In the extensive airing of views, more than 440 correct opinions put forward by the members that were easy to solve or hindered current production were adopted and dealt with in a timely manner, which not only further boosted the members' enthusiasm for airing their views, but also promoted the production at that time. For example, the members proposed to make a concentrated effort to plow the winter fallow land, and the cooperative leaders adopted it and started doing it. But there was a shortage of animal power. The reason was that the cooperative stipulated that members would pay one jiao for using publicly owned livestock to grind grain for one day. Because the fee was too low, the auxiliary labor in the members' families would rather be idle than use the cooperative's donkeys to grind grain. At that time, 23 donkeys were used by the members and could not be used for plowing. And the one jiao fee was not even enough for the cost of fodder. In response, many members put forward opinions and demanded correction. The cooperative management committee adopted this opinion and, after discussion by the members, increased the fee for using a donkey for one day to three jiao and five fen. At the same time, the members mobilized the auxiliary labor in their families to grind grain manually. As a result, the animal power for plowing increased by 23 donkeys. In addition, the opinion of the members that was aired was adopted, and a weaving group was established, and the problem of baskets for the reservoir construction site was also solved.

　　Because of the simultaneous airing and rectification, the members saw that their opinions were truly effective, and a high tide of airing of views was quickly set off. By December 10, more than 97% of the members had expressed their opinions, totaling 1,095 opinions of various kinds. During the same period, in addition to speeding up the progress of the reservoir project, the members also made a concentrated effort to plow more than 1,600 mu of winter fallow land, hauled back a large amount of soil for padding, and also did many agricultural tasks such as sending manure and watering wheat with urine. The More Thorough the Rectification, the Higher the Production Enthusiasm

　　With the arrival of the high tide of airing of views, a high tide of rectification appeared again in mid-December. The rectification stage was far more intense than the airing of views stage, because the problems that were easy to solve were solved in the airing of views stage, and the major issues that were concentrated on solving in the rectification stage were all related to whether the agricultural cooperative could be run well and the relationship between individuals and the collective. Therefore, in those days, the members worked hard all day and rushed to the meeting place early in the evening to heatedly discuss and debate the rectification plan put forward by the cooperative leaders. Major issues were first studied and proposed by the members' representative meeting, and then submitted to the members for discussion. In this way, in the rectification stage, in terms of mutual benefit policies, the issue of tree valuation was resolved; in terms of business management, systems such as the feeding and use of draft animals and financial disclosure were established and improved; in terms of organizational scale, in view of the disadvantage that the production team was too large in the past and it was inconvenient to allocate labor, the production team with fewer households was reorganized, and the cultivated area was correspondingly redivided, and draft animals and farm implements were matched. At the same time, the contradictions between teams (villages) caused by unreasonable distribution were also resolved.

　　This cooperative was composed of a larger village and two smaller villages. When organizing production teams and dividing cultivated areas in the spring of last year, the two smaller villages were considered two production teams, cultivating the original land. However, because these two production teams had more people and less land, especially less good land, although their output exceeded the contracted target last year due to careful cultivation and timely disaster resistance and received excess rewards, because the actual number of workdays exceeded the contracted number of workdays by a large margin, the remuneration per actual workday was lower than the remuneration per contracted workday. For example, the overproduction of the sixth production team totaled more than 1,000 yuan, but the remuneration per workday was only five jiao and four fen. And the production teams in the larger village, because they had fewer people and more land, especially more good land, although three teams lost production because they did not reach the contracted target, because the actual number of workdays was less than the contracted number of workdays, the remuneration per actual workday was higher than the remuneration per contracted workday, and also higher than the overproduction team. For example, the second production team reached six jiao and two fen per workday. For this reason, the members of the small village said before rectification and in the extensive airing of views: "The big village ate the small village," which affected the unity between the teams. This problem was resolved after the members' representative meeting studied and discussed and corrected the phenomenon of unreasonable distribution, and the members were all satisfied. Especially because the cultivated area was redivided and good and bad land were matched after the production teams were reorganized, the possibility of overproduction and less distribution occurring again this year was fundamentally eliminated, so the members' enthusiasm for production was even higher. The seventh production team (when the production team was reorganized, the team was not moved because the number of households was small in the first place), which lost production and had less distribution last year, the members all came with energy after the problem was solved, and even two old women, Yang Jinrong, etc., who were more than 50 years old, went to the reservoir construction site.

　　After extensive airing of views and focused rectification, not only was production not affected, but the members' enthusiasm for labor became higher and higher, and the relationship between cadres and the masses was significantly improved. The cooperative cadres who originally thought that production and rectification were "contradictory" all said: Without rectification, there would be no such changes in the cooperative!

　　Currently, the members of this cooperative are criticizing the capitalist remarks released by the rich middle peasants in the extensive airing of views in conjunction with production. In terms of production, after the small reservoir project is completed, they will start to build a river dam that can block water and irrigate 100 mu of land.

    两个高潮的汇合
    ——记河北行唐武庄农业社的整风运动
  　新华社记者　朱成
    “生产同整风有矛盾”，“要整风就得停止生产”，这是河北省行唐县武庄农业社的干部们在整风运动开始时的一种论调。但是，事实正和他们的论断相反，整风越是深入，社员的劳动热情越高。经过大鸣大放和着重整改两个阶段，全社的劳动出勤率已由80％上升到百分之百以上——连许多社员家中的辅助劳动力都投入了社内的生产。当前，社员们兴修的一座能浇地四百三十多亩的小型水库就要完工，另外，还拉回了大量的垫圈土，在山坡上挖鱼鳞坑准备春季栽树的工作也开始了。
    这个社的整风运动是中共行唐县委工作组领导的，他们是怎样解决了生产同整风的“矛盾”使两个高潮互相推动的呢？
    解除干部的顾虑
    武庄农业社是由一百八十四户农民组成的山区农业社。县委工作组在去年11月20日来到这个社的时候，社里的冬季生产还未开展起来，65％左右的劳动力在家闲着。从10月间就已动工兴修的一座小型水库，由于参加施工的人少，土坝工程进展很慢。针对这种情况，工作组采取了发动干部和社员大鸣大放的方法，讨论全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），制订生产规划，用幸福的前景鼓动人们的劳动热情；同时，还算活计、算时间、算劳力，安排当前的生产。这样，经过七、八天的工作，到11月底，全社劳动出勤率已经激增到80％以上，历来冬季不出门的妇女，也出动了一百多人，在山坡上栽了二万棵洋槐，男社员们除披星戴月地干起往年冬季不干的拉土垫圈和送粪等农活以外，还有更多的人涌向了水库工地。
    生产高潮初步形成了，在11月底，工作组和村支部研究，决定开始整风，干部白天领导社员生产，晚上发动大鸣大放。但是，在每个生产队的鸣放会上，干部鼓动社员鸣放的劲头很不足，表现得很消沉，因此，参加会议的社员有70％不言不语，互相观望，很多人坐着打瞌睡。据此，在二十名党员干部中就有十七名向工作组反映：整风同生产“有矛盾”，“白天干一天活，晚上哪有精神开会？”支部副书记、农业社副主任王士新说：“要整风，水库就得停工！”
    大鸣大放，揭露和暴露问题，是决定整风好坏的第一关，人们不讲意见怎么能成呢？工作组召集村支委开会，研究了鸣放不起来的原因。支委们讲了自己的心里话，也反映了干部和群众的思想状况。他们说，晚上开会鸣放不起来，并不是因为太累没精神。干部主要是有一怕：怕个人思想作风上的缺点和错误被社员揭露出来受批评，受处分。群众主要是有四怕：怕得罪人；怕打击报复；怕提意见不顶事；怕说错了挨斗争。工作组和支委会研究，认为关键问题是干部怕“引火烧身”，这个顾虑打消了，发动群众大鸣大放，及时地表示态度接受社员的正确批评，社员的顾虑自然便会消除了。据此，在12月初的几个晚上，工作组协助支委会连着召开了几次生产队长以上的党员干部会议和党员大会，反复地申述了整风的意义，宣布了在整风中党对干部的政策，指出了党员干部在整风中应持的正确态度，启发他们自觉地投入整风。这样绝大部分党员干部的觉悟提高了，在12月3日晚上一次党员干部会上很自然地展开了鸣放，一向不互相批评的支部书记、社主任等十一个人，相互提了三十四条意见。支部副书记、农业社副主任王士新检讨了自己的强迫命令作风，表示还要发动社员多给自己提意见，主张瞒产私分的社主任李绍凯（党员）检查了资本主义思想，决心要在整风中提高思想。
    党员干部思想搞通以后，经支委会和社管理委员会研究，召开了一次全体社员大会，会上，除主要干部初步检讨了思想作风上的缺点鼓励社员大胆鸣放外，还接受社员在讨论全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）时鸣放出的一些正确意见，宣布改正一批：社干部立即参加生产，和社员共同劳动；在水库工地上改变死分死记和男女同工不同酬的记工方法，实行定额记酬制度；接受社员意见，乘尚未封冻的时机，立即突击翻耕应耕的冬闲地。这样，广大社员鸣放积极性突然增高了。社员杨小车、杨闹子等人在大会会场上就给王士新等人提了不少意见。第五生产队以前开了几个晚上的会议社员一共只提出七条意见，在举行全体社员大会的当天晚上，一次会议就鸣放出意见三十二条。特别是及时的整改，有力地推动了当时的生产，社员大会以后，全社劳动出勤率增到90％以上。在水库工地上，由于实行了包工定额，劳动效率提高了三倍。社员们打一下夯暖一暖手的情况改变了，人们脱掉棉衣还干的直冒汗。社员赵马子过去刨土一天不过五车，实行定额以后，一天刨土十车还多。
    边鸣边改鸣放劲头大
    干部对整风由消极变为积极以后，便提出了许多生产和整风互相结合的方法。一般的除白天领导社员生产晚上开会外，还针对不同的人安排了不同的鸣放时间。例如二十多名饲养员，晚上要喂牲畜，下午要预备饲料，便组织他们在较闲的上午集中开会鸣放。为了解决一部分老年人和孩子多的妇女晚上不便参加鸣放会议的问题，支部动员六十九名党、团员作为代笔人，利用一切可以利用的时间，访问他们，为他们代写书面意见三百六十多条。在领导力量的分工上，确定一批干部掌握生产，一批干部掌握整风。掌握整风的干部，每天都归纳分析社员提出的意见，以便边鸣放边改进。
    在大鸣大放中，对社员提出的容易解决或障碍当前生产的四百四十多条正确意见及时采纳处理，不仅进一步鼓舞了社员的鸣放情绪，还推进了当时的生产。例如社员们提出要突击翻耕冬闲地，社领导上采纳了，也做了起来。但畜力却感不足。原因是：社里规定社员使用公有牲畜推碾一天给钱一角，因为出的用费太低，社员家里的辅助劳力宁肯闲着也用社有的驴推碾，当时就有二十三头驴子由社员使用，不能用来耕地；而一角钱的用费连草料钱也不够。对此，很多社员提出意见，要求改正。社管理委员会采纳了这个意见，经社员讨论，把使驴一天的用费提高为三角五分，同时，社员们又动员家中的辅助劳力人工推碾，结果，耕地的畜力增加了二十三头驴子。另外，还采纳社员鸣放出的意见，成立了编织组，水库工地用筐的问题，也获得了解决。
    由于边鸣放边改进，使社员们看到了自己的意见真正顶事，很快就掀起了鸣放高潮。到12月10日，97％以上的社员都发表了意见，共计鸣放出各种意见一千零九十五条。在同一期间，除水库工程加快了进度外，社员们还突击翻耕了一千六百多亩冬闲地，拉回了大量垫圈土，还做了送粪、用尿浇麦等许多农活。改的越狠生产热情越高
    随着鸣放高潮的到来，在12月中旬又出现了整改高潮。整改阶段是远比鸣放阶段紧张的，因为容易解决的问题在鸣放阶段就解决了，留在整改阶段集中解决的都是牵涉到农业社能否办好和个人同集体关系的大事，因此，在那些天中，社员白天劳累了一天，晚上都老早地跑到会场去，热烈地讨论、争辩社领导上提出的整改方案。重大的问题，还先由社员代表大会研究提出方案，再交社员讨论。就这样，在整改阶段，在互利政策方面，解决了树木的作价问题；在经营管理方面，建立和健全了如像耕畜饲养使役、财务公开等制度；在组织规模上，根据过去生产队太大调配劳动不便的缺点，重新组织了户数较少的生产队，相应地重新划分了耕作区，搭配了耕畜和农具。同时，还解决了由于分配不合理而引起的队与队（村与村）的矛盾问题。
    这个社是由一个较大的村庄和两个较小的村庄组成的。去年春季组织生产队和划分耕作区的时候，两个较小的村庄便算两个生产队，耕种原有的土地。但是，由于这两个生产队人多、地少，特别是好地少，去年虽然因为耕作细致和及时抗灾产量都超过了包产指标，受了超额奖励，但因实际用工数超过包工数很多，在分配时每个实际劳动日报酬比包工的劳动日报酬低，如第六生产队超产部分折款共达一千多元钱，但每个劳动日报酬只有五角四分钱。而较大村庄中的生产队，由于人少、地多，特别是好地多，虽然有三个队因为没有达到包产指标赔了产，但因实际用工数比包工数少，每个实际劳动日的报酬却比包工的劳动日报酬高，也比超产队高，如第二生产队每个劳动日就达六角二分。为此，小村的社员在整风以前和在大鸣大放中都说：“大村吃了小村”，影响了队与队间的团结。这个问题，经社员代表大会研究讨论纠正了分配不合理的现象后，社员都满意了，特别是由于在改组生产队之后，又重新划分了耕作区，搭配了好坏地，从根本上消除了今年再次发生超产少分的可能性，因此社员生产积极性更加高涨。去年赔产少分的第七生产队（生产队改组时，该队因原先户数就少，未动），在问题解决后社员们都来了干劲，连五十多岁的杨金荣等两名老太太都上了水库工地。
    经过大鸣大放和着重整改，不仅生产没有受到影响，而且社员的劳动热情越来越高，干群关系有了显著改善。原先认为生产同整风“有矛盾”的社干部都说：没有整风，社里就不会有这样的变化！
    当前，这个社的社员正在结合生产批判富裕中农在大鸣大放中放出的资本主义言论。在生产上，小型水库工程完工以后，就要着手兴修一条能拦水浇地百亩的拦河坝。
