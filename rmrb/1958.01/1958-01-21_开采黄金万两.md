    Mining Ten Thousand Taels of Gold
    Liaoning Province's Department of Industry plans to vigorously develop gold production this year in six major gold-producing areas: Qingyuan, Andong, Jianping, Yingkou, Fuxin, and Kaiyuan. In addition to organizing farmers to pan for more than 6,700 taels of placer gold and some lode gold, it also plans to invest in the construction of three gold mine concentrators in Jianping, Qingyuan, and Yingkou. This year, it will use a combination of manual labor and semi-mechanization to mine more than 3,200 taels of lode gold.
