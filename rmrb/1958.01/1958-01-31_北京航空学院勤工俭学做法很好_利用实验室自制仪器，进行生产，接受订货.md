Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Over the past five years, teachers, students, and staff at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics have created wealth worth more than 766,000 yuan for the country through three activities: self-made instruments and equipment, production activities combined with teaching practice, and accepting off-campus processing orders during spare time outside of teaching. In addition, their own production of various instruments can save the country a significant amount of foreign exchange each year.

The methods adopted by this school, in addition to completing students' internship tasks, have played three roles:

(1) Ensuring and meeting the needs of teaching and scientific research work. In recent years, with the gradual development of teaching and scientific research work, this school has constantly put forward new requirements for experimental instruments and equipment. However, some special and precise instruments, such as the wind tunnel balance for testing aircraft performance urgently needed for teaching, could not be ordered at home or abroad for a time. The teachers and laboratory technicians of this institute imitated Soviet products and made them for only 18,000 yuan, which was 12,000 yuan less than the price abroad. This greatly boosted everyone's confidence, and later they successively made surface finish testers, various lathe dynamometers and other scientific instruments.

(2) Cultivating students' labor viewpoint and creating wealth for the country. Now, the production tasks of the affiliated factory's practice workshop are ordered according to the requirements of students' practice assignments. For example, for welding operations, the iron sheets were previously cut open for welding practice, and after the practice, the iron sheets were scrapped. Now, the technicians cut the iron sheets, and the students use the welding, gas welding, and butt welding methods specified in the teaching to weld them into kettles and coal stoves. When practicing machining and forging, they produce hand-operated drills and forks. In this way, students not only know the structural principles and operating procedures of machinery and equipment, but also pay attention to product quality. Last year, students produced 519 iron kettles, 319 forks, 130 coal stoves, 50 hand-operated drills, and more than 30,000 pairs of hinges in conjunction with teaching practice. Some products have been acquired by the Beijing Hardware Company under contract.

(3) Giving full play to production capacity and serving the country's economic construction. In the past, the teaching support staff of this institute were unevenly busy, and the utilization efficiency of equipment was different. After unified scheduling, the phenomena of duplication, decentralization, and waste of manpower in equipment were overcome. Various units are connected into an invisible "production line," freeing up all the time outside of teaching for production, and cooperating well with each other. In this way, they have produced scientific instruments such as resistance wire sheets and strain gauge indicators urgently needed by relevant universities and scientific research departments in China, and have also undertaken processing orders for more than 30 kinds of products such as small hardware tools and plumbing parts from 160 units including the Beijing Hardware Company.

The work of this school was carried out in this way: In the first four years, it was mainly to meet the needs of teaching and scientific research work, and occasionally undertook some outside work, but the direction was not clear. In March last year, a campaign to increase production and practice thrift was launched throughout the school. The school leaders affirmed the achievements in self-made equipment in the previous stage, and at the same time, based on past experience, further conducted systematic investigations and research, and believed that the school had great potential: First, the school has many talents, from technicians and laboratory technicians to senior scientific researchers, all kinds of professional talents are available, and most technicians and teaching support staff have less workload, so there is potential in talents. Second, the school's experimental equipment is complete, and only 10% of the time is used outside of teaching tasks, so there is potential in utilization efficiency. Third, teachers and students waste about 8,000 kilograms of metal materials in experiments and practices every semester, and there is also potential in the use of raw materials. Based on this situation, the college immediately established a "Production Increase Office" to lead the 15 units in the school with conditions for production to uniformly arrange production tasks. During this rectification movement, according to the opinions of the masses, the school leaders renamed the Production Increase Office to the Affiliated Factory, which included five units such as a practice workshop, a production workshop, an instrument workshop, a woodworking factory, and a printing factory, to jointly complete teaching and production tasks.

    北京航空学院勤工俭学做法很好
    利用实验室自制仪器，进行生产，接受订货
    新华社30日讯　北京航空学院教师、学生和职工们五年中在自制仪器设备、结合教学实习进行生产活动、利用教学以外的空隙时间接受校外的加工订货等三方面，已为国家创造了七十六万六千多元的财富。此外，他们自己生产各种仪器，每年还可以为国家节省大量外汇。
    这个学校所采用的这些办法，除完成了学生的实习任务外，还起了三种作用：
    （一）保证和满足了教学和科学研究工作的需要。这个学校近几年来，随着教学和科学研究工作的逐步发展，对实验仪器设备不断提出了新的要求。但是一些特殊的、精密仪器，如教学上急需的试验飞机性能用的风洞天秤，在国内国外一时都订不到货。这个学院的教师和实验员就仿照苏联成品进行试制，只花了一万八千元就做成了，比国外定价少一万二千元。这大大鼓舞了大家的信心，以后又陆续做成了光洁度检查仪，各种车床测力仪等科学仪器。
    （二）培养了学生的劳动观点，为国家创造了财富。现在，附属工厂实习车间的生产任务就是根据学生实习作业的要求订出来的。如焊工作业，以前把铁皮剪开，进行焊接实习，实习完了，铁皮也就报废了。现在由技工们把铁皮剪裁好，学生们应用教学上规定的电焊、风焊、对焊等方法把它焊成水壶、煤球炉。实习机工、锻工时，就生产手摇台钻和杈子。这样，学生不但知道机器设备的构造原理和操作规程，而且也注意产品质量。去年学生们结合教学实习，曾生产出五百一十九个铁水壶、三百一十九把杈子、一百三十个煤球炉、五十台手摇台钻、三万多副合叶。有些产品已经根据合同为北京市五金公司所收购。
    （三）充分发挥生产能力，为国家经济建设服务。这个学院原来教学辅助人员忙闲不均，设备使用效率高低不一，经过统一调度以后，克服了设备上的重复、分散以及人力浪费的现象。各单位连结成为一个无形的“生产带”，腾出了教学以外的全部时间进行生产，彼此互相配合得很好。这样，他们就生产出了国内有关高等学校和科学研究部门急需的电阻丝片、应变仪指示器等科学仪器，还承接了北京市五金公司等一百六十个单位的小五金工具、水暖零件等三十多种产品的加工订货。
    这个学校的这些工作是这样展开的：前四年主要是为了满足教学工作和科学研究的需要，间或承揽一些外活，但方向并不明确。去年3月间全校展开了增产节约运动，学校领导上肯定了前一阶段在自制设备方面的成绩，同时根据以往的经验进一步作了系统的调查研究，认为学校的潜力是很大的：第一，学校人才多，从技工、实验员一直到高级科学研究人员，各种专业人才都有，而且大部分技工和教学辅助人员工作量较少，因此人才上有潜力。第二，全校实验设备齐全，除了教学任务以外，被利用的时间只占10％，使用效率上有潜力。第三，每学期师生们在实验和实习上耗损、浪费的金属材料约八千多公斤，在利用原材料方面也有潜力。根据这种情况，学院随即成立了“增产办公室”，领导全校有条件进行生产的十五个单位统一安排了生产任务。在这次整风运动中，学校领导上根据群众的意见，又将增产办公室改名为附属工厂，下设实习车间、生产车间、仪表车间、木工厂、印刷厂等五个单位，共同完成教学和生产任务。
