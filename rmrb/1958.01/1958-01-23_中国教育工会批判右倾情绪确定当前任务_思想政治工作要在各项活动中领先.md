Xinhua News Agency report: The Second Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the China Education Union was held in Beijing from January 18th to 20th.

After discussing the work situation in the year since the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee, and based on the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union and the basic tasks of our country in the next ten to fifteen years, this meeting determined that the current specific tasks of the Education Union are to realize the requirement of "transforming intellectuals who came from the old society, cultivating new intellectuals, and establishing a contingent of working-class intellectuals." The meeting pointed out that the members of the Education Union are mainly mental workers. After successive political movements, especially after the anti-rightist struggle, they have made varying degrees of progress politically. However, due to the influence of their family background and past education, the majority of them still belong to the category of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals in terms of ideology and political stance. Therefore, in order to enable them to undertake the arduous tasks of cultivating laborers needed to build a strong socialist country and making scientific research better serve socialist construction, it is necessary to thoroughly transform the thinking of old intellectuals. The meeting pointed out that in the past, the Education Union failed to clearly use the method of class analysis to specifically examine the ideological reality of the ranks of educational and scientific workers. Therefore, there was a certain degree of right-leaning sentiment in the work, one-sidedly emphasizing unity and care, paying attention to solving the problems of their working conditions and living conditions (which must continue to be done in the future), but relaxing the ideological and political work for them. The meeting believes that the ideological transformation of intellectuals mainly relies on the method of self-education. The Education Union is the broadest organization of mass voluntary association, including almost all educational workers and scientific workers. Therefore, it is also an organization for the masses to conduct self-education.

The meeting believes that the Education Union must adhere to taking ideological and political work as the soul of all activities. An important ideological and political task of the Education Union at present is to mobilize and organize the masses to respond to the Party's call for combining mental and physical labor, participate in physical labor, and receive labor training. Educational and scientific workers in various regions, especially rural teachers, have already taken many active actions in supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production. In the future, education unions at all levels must make greater efforts to purposefully and systematically mobilize and organize them to support the great leap forward in agricultural production. The meeting believes that the ideological and political work of the trade union must also be combined with the daily mass life and welfare work; organizing teachers to visit and travel to strengthen teachers' understanding of social life and invigorate teachers' cultural and sports life should also be elevated to the height of ideological and political work.

The meeting pointed out that the Education Union must also list assisting the administrative departments in running education and scientific research undertakings well as one of its important tasks. At present, under the unified arrangement of the Party, it should first cooperate with the administration to thoroughly implement the rectification work, and then promptly guide the enthusiasm of the masses to delve into professional work and improve the quality of work. At the same time, it is necessary to guide the masses to understand and implement the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily and running scientific undertakings diligently and thriftily.

The meeting believes that in order to improve the leadership of the Education Union and strengthen ties with the masses, it is first necessary to strengthen the ideological construction of the union and conduct an irreconcilable struggle against the various forms of revisionist thought in the trade union movement. At the same time, according to the characteristics that the vast majority of the cadres of the Education Union come from the ranks of teachers and are themselves intellectuals, it is believed that it is necessary to appropriately transform the ranks of trade union cadres and organize trade union cadres to participate in physical labor.

At this meeting, it was decided to remove the rightist Qian Duansheng from his position as Vice Chairman of the National Committee, and to remove him from his positions as member of the National Committee and member of the Presidium. The rightist Zheng Kuichang was removed from his positions as member of the National Committee and member of the Presidium, and the rightists Jin Haiguan and Shi Jun were removed from their positions as members of the National Committee.

    中国教育工会批判右倾情绪确定当前任务
    思想政治工作要在各项活动中领先
    据新华社讯　中国教育工会第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议18日至20日在北京举行。
    这次会议讨论了第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议以来，一年多时间内的工作情况以后，根据我国今后十年到十五年内的基本任务和中国工会第八次全国代表大会的精神，确定教育工会当前具体任务是实现“改造旧社会过来的知识分子，培养新的知识分子，建立一支工人阶级的知识分子队伍”的要求。会议指出，教育工会的成员主要是脑力劳动者，他们经过历次政治运动，特别是经过反右派斗争，在政治上有了不同程度的进步。但是由于他们的家庭出身和过去所受教育的影响，其中大多数在意识形态和政治立场上还属于资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子的范畴。因此，要使他们担负起培养建设社会主义强国所需要的劳动者，和使科学研究工作更好地为社会主义建设服务这样的艰巨任务，必须彻底地改造旧知识分子的思想。会议指出，过去教育工会未能明确运用阶级分析的方法，来具体考察教育工作者和科学工作者队伍的思想实际情况，因此在工作中存在着某种程度的右倾情绪，片面地强调团结、强调照顾，注意了解决他们的工作条件、生活条件的问题（这是今后还必须做的），但是放松了对他们进行思想政治工作。会议认为，知识分子的思想改造，主要依靠自我教育的方法。教育工会是几乎包括全体教育工作者、科学工作者在内的，最广泛的、群众自愿结合的组织。因此它也是群众进行自我教育的组织。
    会议认为，教育工会必须坚持把思想政治工作作为各项活动的灵魂。当前教育工会的一项重要的思想政治工作是发动和组织群众响应党的关于脑力劳动必须和体力劳动相结合的号召，参加体力劳动，接受劳动锻炼。各地教育工作者和科学工作者，特别是农村教师已在支援农业生产大跃进方面采取了许多积极行动。各级教育工会今后要以更大的努力，有目的、有计划地发动和组织他们支援农业生产大跃进。会议认为，工会的思想政治工作，还必须结合日常群众生活福利工作来进行；组织教师参观、旅行，以加强教师对社会生活的体察和活跃教师的文化体育生活，也同样应提到思想政治工作的高度。
    会议指出，教育工会还必须把协助行政方面办好教育事业和科学研究事业列为重要任务之一。当前应该在党的统一安排下，首先配合行政把整改工作贯彻到底，然后及时地把群众热情引导到钻研业务，提高工作质量方面去。同时，必须引导群众认识和贯彻执行勤俭办学、勤俭办科学事业的方针。
    会议认为，为了改善教育工会的领导，密切同群众的联系，首先必须加强工会的思想建设，同工会运动中形形色色的修正主义思想进行不调和的斗争。同时，根据教育工会的干部绝大部分是从教师队伍中来的，本身就是知识分子的特点，认为必须适当地改造工会干部的队伍，组织工会干部参加体力劳动。
    在这次会议上，决定撤销右派分子钱端升的全国委员会副主席的职务，并撤销其全国委员会委员和主席团委员的职务。撤销右派分子郑逵昌的全国委员会委员和主席团委员的职务，撤销右派分子金海观、时钧两人的全国委员会委员的职务。
