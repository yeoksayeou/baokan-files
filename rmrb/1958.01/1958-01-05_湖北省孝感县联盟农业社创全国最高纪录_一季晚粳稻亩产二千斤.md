Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th: The Lianmeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhongxin Township, Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, had 18.15 mu of single-season late indica rice in 1957. After inspection by cadres from the local Agricultural Technology Guidance Station, the average yield was 2,022 jin of rice per mu. Among them, three mu averaged 2,137.5 jin per mu, setting the highest national record for unit area yield of single-season late rice.

The Lianmeng Agricultural Cooperative was trying single-season late indica rice for the first time, using the variety "10509". After the autumn harvest, local cadres, the cooperative's production team leader, and experienced farmers held two discussions, summarizing the main experiences of the high yield of this 18.15 mu of single-season late rice as: deep plowing, close planting, sufficient fertilizer, and prevention and control of pests and diseases. These eighteen-plus mu of fields were generally plowed to a depth of four cun or more, about one cun deeper than in 1956; the planting density reached more than 30,000 seedlings per mu, about 5,000 more than local late rice; each mu was fertilized with 90 dan of cattle manure and 80 jin of soybean cake as base fertilizer; topdressing was applied three times after transplanting, with the following amounts per mu: the first application was 14 jin of ammonium sulfate and 30 jin of soybean cake, the second application was 14 jin of ammonium sulfate and 15 dan of human and animal manure, and the third application was 12 jin of ammonium sulfate, 14 dan of human and animal manure, and 4 jin of superphosphate; after transplanting, three applications of pesticide and one application of fungicide were carried out. Therefore, the rice grew very well throughout. According to the cooperative members and technical cadres, if some of the shortcomings in fertilization methods and cultivation techniques last year can be overcome in the future, production can be further increased.

    湖北省孝感县联盟农业社创全国最高纪录
    一季晚粳稻亩产二千斤
    新华社武汉4日电　湖北省孝感县中心乡联盟农业生产合作社1957年有一八点一五亩一季晚粳稻，经当地农业技术指导站干部验收结果，平均每亩产稻谷二千零二十二斤，其中有三亩平均亩产二千一百三十七点五斤，创造全国一季晚稻单位面积产量最高纪录。
    联盟农业社是第一次试种一季晚粳稻的，用的品种是“一○五○九”。秋收后，当地干部和这个社的生产队长、老农座谈两次，总结了这一八点一五亩一季晚稻丰产的主要经验是：深耕、密植、肥足、防治病虫害。这十八亩多田，一般深耕到四寸以上，比1956年深一寸左右；插秧密度每亩达三万多蔸，比当地晚稻增加五千蔸左右；每亩底肥施牛栏粪九十担，豆饼八十斤；插秧后追肥三次，每亩追肥量：第一次追施硫酸铵十四斤、豆饼三十斤，第二次追硫酸铵十四斤、人畜粪十五担，第三次追硫酸铵十二斤、人畜粪十四担、过磷酸钙四斤；插秧后进行三次药剂杀虫和一次药剂防病。因此稻谷始终长的很好。据社员们和技术干部谈，如果今后克服去年在施肥方法和耕作技术上存在的一些缺点，还可以进一步增产。
