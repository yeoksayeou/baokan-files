　　France's "Worth"
　　The "Columbia Broadcasting System's" Paris correspondent reported that France has begun to negotiate with the United States on the issue of establishing intermediate-range missile bases in France.
　　People still remember that at the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard pretended to be indifferent to the U.S. missile base plan, while talking at length about the "principle of equality among member states of the alliance." It turns out that Gaillard's pretentious posture at the time was merely aimed at "raising his worth" so that he could gain more advantages in the transaction of selling himself to the United States.
　　So, what exactly is France's "worth" worth? According to UPI, France recently plans to borrow 430 million to 460 million U.S. dollars from foreign countries, of which more than 230 million U.S. dollars needs to be borrowed from the United States. No wonder France's tune has changed.

　　Will He Retract Again?
　　When British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's talk about signing a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union aroused strong resonance in Western European countries, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer told reporters that he was prepared to test new methods of contact with the Soviet Union.
　　During the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, Adenauer expressed his willingness to contact the Soviet Union on the issue of peace negotiations, thus gaining praise from Western European countries and public opinion within West Germany. However, when American newspapers, under official instruction, scolded him for "changing course with the wind," he quickly retracted.
　　I wonder if Adenauer will retract again if the American newspapers scold him this time?

　　Crocodile Tears
　　In its "outlook" on the Far East situation on the 4th, UPI said that for the United States, "the most dangerous place in Asia is the Philippines. The financial situation there is indeed hopeless," and continuing this way, "it will ultimately lead the United States to sacrifice its best and most reliable friend in the Far East." Words dripped with tears.
　　The concern revealed by Washington through UPI is not without reason, because the Philippines' dire economic situation is indeed a fact. UPI avoids mentioning who caused the Philippines' economic deterioration. But on the same day, Philippine Congressman Emmerga issued a statement to the press, denouncing the U.S. dollar for binding the Philippines' economy, placing it in a colonial status. He called for the abolition of the "U.S.-Philippines Trade Agreement."
　　It turns out that Washington is shedding crocodile tears.

    法国的“身价”
    美国“哥伦比亚广播公司”驻巴黎记者报道，法国已经开始同美国谈判在法国建立中程导弹基地问题。
    人们还记得，在北大西洋公约集团的巴黎会议上，法国总理盖伊阿曾经装作对美国的导弹基地计划表示冷淡，而大谈什么“公约成员国的平等原则”。原来，当时盖伊阿那种装模作样的姿态，其目的不过是想“抬高身价”，以便在向美国进行卖身投靠的交易中能够多占一点便宜而已。
    那么，法国的“身价”究竟值几文钱呢？据合众社透露，法国最近打算向外国贷款四亿三千万美元到四亿六千万美元，其中有二亿三千多万美元需要向美国借。难怪法国的腔调变了。
    还缩不缩？
    当英国首相麦克米伦关于同苏联签订互不侵犯条约的谈话在西欧各国引起强烈共鸣的时候，西德总理阿登纳向记者表示，他准备试验和苏联进行接触的新方法。
    在北大西洋集团会议开会期间，阿登纳曾经表示愿意就和平谈判问题和苏联进行接触，因而得到西欧各国和西德国内舆论的赞扬。但是，后来美国报纸在官方的授意下骂他“见风转舵”，他就赶紧缩回去了。
    不知道这回如果美国的报纸再骂他的时候，阿登纳是不是又要缩回头去呢？
    鳄鱼的眼泪
    合众社4日“展望”远东局势时说，对美国来说，“亚洲最危险的地方是菲律宾。那里的财政情况的确是无可救药了”，继续下去，“就会最终使美国牺牲掉它在远东最好的和最可靠的朋友”。言下泪欲垂。
    合众社所流露的华盛顿方面的担心不是没有理由的，因为菲律宾经济情况十分恶劣确是事实。菲律宾的经济恶化，孰令致之，合众社对此却避而不谈。但是就在同一天，菲律宾议员恩默加向报界发表声明，指斥美元束缚着菲律宾的经济，使菲律宾的经济处于殖民地的地位。他呼吁废除“美菲贸易协定”。
    华盛顿流的原来是鳄鱼的眼泪。
