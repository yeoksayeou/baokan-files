    Pay Attention to Age Characteristics When Educating Children
    Bi Zhi
    The education a child receives in early childhood has a significant impact on them. However, to effectively educate children, it is essential to consider their age characteristics. Let's examine a few real-life examples:
    One Sunday, a father happily took his four-year-old daughter, Xiao Ying, to the zoo. They walked past the monkey mountain and arrived near the elephant enclosure. The enthusiastic father began to introduce the elephant to Xiao Ying: "Look, this is an elephant. It lives in the tropics, is strong, and has a docile temperament. It can be used as a means of transportation… Its tusks can be used to make various tools and valuable decorations…" But Xiao Ying didn't listen to a word. She just kept saying, "Daddy, look how big its ears are, and how fun its nose is. Daddy, does it eat fish? Does it make a sound?..." The father became a little impatient. "Sigh! This child just doesn't like to learn."… After dinner, Aunt Li instructed her five-year-old son, Xiao Qing, to carry the soil box, weighing at least thirty pounds, outside the door with his older brother. Xiao Qing said with difficulty, "Mom, the soil box is too heavy. I can't carry it." Aunt Li still coaxed him to carry it. Xiao Qing had no choice but to bend over and struggle to carry the soil box away with his brother. … What do these examples tell us? It can be seen that no matter how adults start from the motive of educating their children well, the results can be counterproductive if they do not pay attention to the children's age.
    Children, especially preschool children (three to seven years old), think concretely. They cannot understand things that are far from their lives in an abstract way. Therefore, to educate children and increase their knowledge, we must first start with the most concrete, easiest-to-understand things, that is, things that children can directly see, hear, or touch. If Xiao Ying's father had first told her, "Look how big this elephant is! Its ears are like big palm-leaf fans; look how long its nose is! It can roll up a big tree, and it can also put a small tomato in its mouth!..." This would first allow the child to concretely understand the characteristics of the elephant, and then make further introductions to gradually enrich the child's knowledge. If one deviates from the child's existing knowledge base and their interests, the educational effect will certainly not be good.
    The physical strength of children aged three to seven is in the stage of growth and development. Taking the spine, which supports the whole body, as an example, it is still very soft, and the bones of other parts of the body are also like this. At this time, being affected by excessive external force can cause bone curvature and affect the normal development of the body. Therefore, it is obviously wrong for Aunt Li to let Xiao Qing carry such a heavy soil box. Cultivating children's habit of loving labor is certainly necessary, but it is best to let them do some labor within their capabilities. If the parents carry the soil box themselves and let Xiao Qing tidy up the dining table or sweep the floor, wouldn't that be better? This not only cultivates the child's habit of labor, making him happily help his mother with work often, but also does not affect his health.

    教育孩子要注意年龄特点
    辟芷
    孩子在小时候所受的教育，对他影响很大。但是，要收到教育孩子的效果，必须注意年龄特点。这里我们不妨先举几件实际的例子：
    星期日，爸爸兴高彩烈地带着四岁的小英去逛动物园。他们走过了猴山来到象房旁边，热心的爸爸滔滔不绝地给小英介绍开了：“你瞧，这是大象，它生长在热带，力量大，性情驯服，可以用来作运输工具，……它的牙可以制造各种用具和名贵的装饰品……”。可是小英一句也没有听进去，只是一个劲地嚷着：“爸爸，瞧它的耳朵多大，鼻子多好玩。爸爸，它吃鱼吗？它会叫吗？……”爸爸有些不耐烦了，“唉！这孩子就是不爱学习。”……晚饭后，李大婶吩咐五岁的小清和哥哥一块把那个足有三十斤重的土箱搭到门外去。小清为难地说：“妈妈，土箱太重，我搭不动。”李大婶还是哄着他去搭。小清只好弯着腰吃力地和哥哥把土箱搭走了。……以上这些例子告诉我们些什么呢？可以看出，无论成人是怎样从教育好孩子的动机出发，但是由于没有注意孩子的年龄，结果反而弄巧成拙了。
    孩子们，尤其是学龄前的儿童（三至七岁的孩子）的思维是具体的，他们还不能抽象地去了解远离他们生活的事物。所以，要对孩子们进行教育，使他们增加知识，首先就要从最具体的、最易懂的，也就是孩子们能够直接看到、听到或接触到的事物开始。如果小英的爸爸首先告诉他：“你看，这只象多大呀！他的耳朵好像一把大蒲扇；你看，它的鼻子多长呀！它能卷起一棵大树，也能把一个小小的西红柿往嘴里送呢！……”这样，先使孩子具体地了解大象的特点，然后再作进一步的介绍，逐渐丰富孩子的知识。如果脱离了孩子已有的知识基础，脱离了他们的兴趣，那么教育的效果一定不会好的。
    三至七岁的孩子，他们的体力正处在成长发育的阶段，就拿支持全身的脊椎骨来说，还是非常柔软的，身体其他各部分的骨胳也是这样。这时候，受过重的外力影响，可以造成骨胳弯曲，影响身体的正常发育。所以，李大婶让小清去搭那么重的土箱，显然是不对的。培养孩子爱劳动的习惯，当然是需要的，但最好能让他做一些力所能及的劳动。如果爸爸妈妈自己去搭土箱，而让小清去收拾一下饭桌，或扫一下地，这不是很好吗？这既能培养孩子的劳动习惯，使他经常愉快地帮助妈妈工作，又不致影响他的健康。
