    140,000 People投入 into Winter Production
    Hong'an Strives to Become a "Double Thousand Jin" County
    (Our dispatch) Hong'an County, Hubei Province, which has already reached the 800 jin target set by the National Agricultural Development Program, is now striving to become a "Double Thousand Jin County" in 1958, aiming to achieve an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu for both grain and peanuts throughout the county.
    Since the beginning of winter, in order to achieve the goal of a "Double Thousand Jin County," 140,000 laborers throughout the county have投入 themselves into the winter production campaign.
    A prominent feature of Hong'an County's winter production campaign last year was the great enthusiasm from top to bottom, the wide mobilization, the good performance of advanced areas, the catching up of backward areas, the strong momentum of men, and the non-lagging of women. The vast majority of district and township cadres in the county enthusiastically responded to the county party committee's slogan of "Two mu of land per person, 3,000 jin of grain and oil, 400 dan of fertilizer, and 500 points of labor," working hard and deeply, and taking the lead.
    By December 20, 1957, the county had completed a total of 760 small reservoirs, ponds, river dams, and canals. Several hundred large, medium, and small reservoirs, as well as other ponds, dams, and canals are currently under construction. The number of water conservancy projects already completed and under construction is 1,210 more than in the same period last year.
    Currently, Hong'an County has accumulated 18.16 million dan of soil fertilizer and 4.6 million dan of pond mud. The amount of fertilizer completed now is more than 7 million dan more than in the same period the year before, and the green manure area has expanded tenfold compared to the year before. In order to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, more than 850 new large pig pens have been completed, 368 new toilets have been built, 420 new manure pools have been made, and 8,150 cellars have been dug in the fields. The county's winter sowing plan of more than 270,000 mu has also been overfulfilled. At present, 70% of the county's wheat and rapeseed have been weeded for the first time, and topdressing is being rushed in conjunction with weeding.

    十四万人投入冬季生产
    红安力争成为双千斤县
    本报讯　提前达到了全国农业发展纲要规定的八百斤指标的湖北省红安县，正在努力争取在1958年成为“双千斤县”，要使全县粮食、花生的每亩平均产量都达到一千斤。
    入冬以来，为实现“双千斤县”的目标全县有十四万劳动大军投入了冬季生产运动。
    红安县去年冬季生产运动的一个显著特点是：从上到下干劲大，发动面广，先进地区搞的好，落后地方也赶上了，男子劲头足，妇女也不落后。全县广大区、乡干部热烈响应了县委提出的“每人两亩地，粮油三千斤，积肥四百担，劳动五百分”的口号，在工作上艰苦深入，带头干。
    到1957年12月20日止，全县已完成小水库、堰塘、河坝、渠道共七百六十处，现正在施工的有大型、中型、小型水库数百处以及其它塘堰、河坝、渠道等。现在已经完成和正在施工的水利工程比去年同期多一千二百一十处。
    目前红安县已积土肥一千八百一十六万担，已挑塘泥四百六十多万担，现在完成的肥料数比前年同期多七百多万担，绿肥面积比前年扩大了十倍。为了大量积肥，已完成新修大猪圈八百五十多个。新建厕所三百六十八个，新做粪池四百二十多个，田头挖窖八千一百五十个。全县二十七万多亩冬播计划，也已超额完成。目前全县小麦、油菜已锄完头草的占70％，正结合锄草抢追肥。
