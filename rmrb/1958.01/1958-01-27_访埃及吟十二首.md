Twelve Poems of Visiting Egypt
Guō Mòruò

Arriving at the Airport, Received a Grand Welcome
Amidst the profound Sino-Egyptian friendship, cheers deafened the ears.
Often heard Nasser, only heard Mao Zedong.
Green flags waved overhead, fresh flowers filled the arms.
Not even bothering to move my steps, I was crowded out of the throng.
(1) The Egyptian flag is a green star and crescent flag, with the star and crescent in white. The welcomers each held a small flag, waving it overhead.

Leaving the Airport for Cairo City
The setting sun redder than fire, the flat sand filled the eyes with yellow.
Pitifully thin camels, forlorn birds in the vast expanse.
The ancient meaning and distant customs flow, new plans and years are long.
When will the date palm trees (2) be planted all over the central desert?
(2) Date palm trees, known as Balakh in Egypt, resemble coconut trees but are actually a kind of date. They are abundant in Egypt. Ancient Chinese books refer to them as sea dates, golden dates, Persian dates, millennium dates, and ten-thousand-year dates.

Staying at the Semiramis Hotel in Cairo (3)
The bridge over the castle head shines brightly, the neon lights never fade at night.
A pair of majestic lions guard it, a divine falcon is the emblem.
The new moon is close to the heart of the sky, the fountain is high above the water.
Like the Spring State, boiling tea and talking about good nights.
(3) Semiramis was the name of an ancient Egyptian queen, used as the hotel's name. It is located at the western end of the castle bridge (The bridge of castle), overlooking the Nile River. There is a pair of bronze lions at each end of the bridge. On the north side of the bridge, an Egyptian national emblem is visible, its symbol being a divine falcon.

Participating in the Victory Day Celebration in Port Said (4)
The vast Suez, a long river connecting continents.
A million Egyptian lives, fighting the enemy for a year.
The pirates are all gone, the residents celebrate grandly.
Today in Port Said, the torches burn brightly.
(4) After the Suez Crisis in 1956, the Anglo-French invading forces completely withdrew from Port Said on December 23. The Egyptian government designated this day as Victory Day. It was the first anniversary, and a grand celebration was held.

At the Head of the Delegation Meeting of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference
Brotherly Asian and African countries, suffered disasters for years.
Seeking common ground, people are not different, the anti-imperialist will is firmer.
Seeking independence and equality, respecting sovereignty in coexistence.
Neo-colonialism's illusions are difficult to fulfill.

Opening of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference
Boasting about our party with color, the light comes from the East.
The West wind is now overwhelmed, the South is soaring high.
Forty-six countries, representatives over five hundred strong.
Anti-racial discrimination, another chapter after Bandung.

Closing of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference
Criticizing the Paris Conference (5), supporting Moscow.
The voice of peace is loud, the path of solidarity is more.
Helping each other and learning from each other, neither biased nor inclined.
On New Year's Day (6), singing triumphantly together.
(5) "Paris Conference" refers to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting on December 16, 1957; "Moscow" refers to the meeting of representatives of 64 Communist and Workers' Parties after the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution and its declaration of peace.
(6) The Cairo Conference closed on New Year's Day, 1958.

Visiting the Pyramids of Giza (7)
The three pyramids, their majesty forces itself from all directions.
The Sphinx startles from a high hill, the king's temple recalls its grandeur.
Giant stones weigh thousands of pounds, the ark is ten yards long.
Laborers believe in the sacred, marveling at the unparalleled miracle.
(7) There are three pyramids in Giza, tombs of three generations of kings, all artifacts from 4,600 years ago. The pyramids are made of huge granite stones, each stone averaging two and a half tons. The largest is the ancestral tomb, said to be made of 2.3 million stones. There is a Sphinx statue in front of the ancestral tomb, which is very magnificent. The king's temple in front of the ancestral tomb was also built with giant stones, with only ruins remaining. In recent years, a solar ship was discovered next to the pyramid, with more than a thousand pieces of wood. Because it was preserved in a sealed stone cellar, the wood is solid and not decayed. Egyptian archaeologists are working on restoration. The ship is very grand, intended for the deceased's water travel during resurrection. The ship image is commonly seen in ancient Egyptian tomb murals.

Boating on the Nile
Paddling a light boat with oars on the Nile.
The sunshine fills the universe, the weather resembles early autumn.
Swimmers follow one another, shedding clothes with sweat still flowing.
Sincere and happy to drink three times (8), full of feelings and gentleness.
(8) Egyptian saying: "Those who drink the water of the Nile once will surely drink it three times."

Visiting the Alexandria Palace (9)
The sea color is as blue as indigo, the palace stands on the shore.
The buildings boast of wealth and beauty, the robes are still bright and fresh.
The Pharaoh eventually floated to the sea, the people wait for fertile land.
The valley along the Nile River, the battlefield is boundless.
(9) There are two palaces in Alexandria, located on the Mediterranean coast, now museums. At the time of the revolution's victory, Egyptian King Farouk left the country by boat from one of the palaces. Egypt has initially carried out land reform, but land distribution has not yet reached the poor and landless peasants.

Returning to Cairo City from Alexandria at Night
The bright moon illuminates the desert, the yellow sand goes straight to the sky.
Racing past the pyramids, recalling the solar ship.
Labor has no difference between ancient and modern, governance has changes.
We will see human determination prevail, turning thousands of acres into fertile land.

Night Tour of Luxor in Upper Egypt
The city on the Nile is quiet, people are just settling down.
The sky is high, the moon is round and full.
Ancient temples, clusters of pillars stand, light boats, a sail hangs.
Graceful songs rise, clanking waves murmur.
Nights on the Nile, up and down for six thousand years.

[Editor's Note] The eleventh poem "Returning to Cairo City from Alexandria at Night" and the twelfth poem "Night Tour of the Nile in Luxor, Upper Egypt" from the "Twelve Poems of Visiting Egypt" were published on the supplement on the 16th of this month along with Comrade Zhao Puchu's matching poems. Because it is a set of poems, it is republished here.

    访埃及吟十二首
    郭沫若
    初到飞机场受隆重欢迎中埃新友谊　欢呼震耳聋时闻纳赛尔　但听毛泽东绿帜挥头上①　鲜花满抱中不遑劳步武　被拥出人丛
    ①埃及国旗为绿色星月旗，星月呈白色。欢迎者
    人手小旗一，在头上挥动。
    离飞机场赴开罗市夕日红于火　平沙满目黄明驼怜瘦削　飞鸟怅苍茫古意流风远　新猷岁月长何时椰枣树②　种遍漠中央
    ②椰枣树，埃及名Balakh，树如椰子树，其实类枣。埃及多有之。中国古籍中有海枣、金枣、波斯枣、千年枣、万年枣等名。
    宿开罗市Semiramis旅馆③炜炜堡头桥　霓虹夜不消雄狮双座镇　神隼一徽标新月天心近　喷泉水面高春申相仿佛　煮茗话良宵
    ③Semiramis古埃及女王名，旅馆以为号。在堡头桥（The　bridge　of　castle）西端，俯瞰尼罗河。桥头各有铜狮一对。桥之北侧有一埃及国徽可见，其象为神隼。
    在塞得港参加胜利节④荡荡苏彝士　长河大陆通埃人百万血　抗敌一年功海盗逋逃尽　居民庆典隆只今塞得港　火炬看熊熊
    ④1956年苏彝士事件后，英法侵略军以12月23日由塞得港完全撤退，埃及政府定此日为胜利节。适届一周年，曾举行盛大庆祝。
    亚非人民团结大会团长会议上兄弟亚非国　受灾历有年求同人不异　反帝志弥坚独立期平等　共存重主权殖民新主义　幻梦势难圆
    亚非人民团结大会开幕有色夸吾党　光明自东方西风今压倒　南甸此鹰扬国家四十六　代表半千强种族反歧视　万隆又一章
    亚非人民团结大会闭幕批判巴黎会⑤　支援莫斯科和平声势大　团结道途多相助还相学　不偏复不颇新年元旦日⑥　共唱凯旋歌
    ⑤“巴黎会”指1957年12月16日北大西洋公约组织会议；“莫斯科”指十月革命40周年的直后64个共产党和工人党代表会议及其和平宣言。
    ⑥开罗会议以1958年元旦闭幕。
    游Giza金字塔⑦金字塔三座　威严逼四方人狮惊岳岳　王庙忆堂堂巨石千钧重　方舟十丈长劳工信神圣　奇迹叹无双
    ⑦Giza金字塔凡三座，系祖孙三代之王陵，均四千六百年前古物。塔为巨大花岗石所砌成，每石平均重二吨半。最大一座为祖墓，计用石二百三十万个云。人狮（Sphinx）石像一，甚雄伟，在祖墓前。祖墓前王庙亦用巨石建成，仅存废趾。近年在塔旁发现太阳船一艘，木料在一千枚以上。因保藏在密闭石窖中，木质坚固未朽，埃及考古学家正从事复原工作。船甚宏大，系备死者返魂时水路旅行之用。船象在埃及古墓壁画中习见。
    弄舟尼罗河上双桨掖轻舟　尼罗河上游晴光弥六合　天气拟初秋泅水人相继　解衣汗尚流诚甘三度饮⑧　万感足和柔
    ⑧埃及口碑：“尼罗河之水，曾饮一次者，必饮至三次。”
    游亚力山大行宫⑨海色青如靛　行宫立岸前楼台夸富丽　袍服尚鲜妍法老终浮海　人民待有田尼罗河畔谷　疆场正无边
    ⑨亚力山大港有行宫二座，在地中海岸上，已成博物馆。革命胜利时埃王法鲁克即由行宫之一乘船去国。埃及曾初步进行土地改革，但土地分配尚未及贫雇农。
    夜由亚力山大港回开罗市明月照荒漠　黄沙直入天驰过金字塔　回忆太阳船劳力无今古　经纶有变迁会看人定胜　万顷化良田
    在上埃及洛克沙市夜游
    尼罗河市静人初定　天高月正圆古祠群柱立　轻舸一帆悬袅袅歌声发　琮琮浪语传尼罗河上夜　上下六千年
          〔编者附记〕“访埃杂吟十二首”的第十一首“夜由亚力山大港回开罗市”及第十二首“在上埃及洛克沙市夜游尼罗河”二首，曾于本月16日在副刊上与赵朴初同志的和诗一起发表过，因系组诗，故再刊出。
