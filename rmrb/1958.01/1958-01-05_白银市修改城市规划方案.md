    Baiyin City Revises Urban Planning Scheme
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 3rd: Baiyin City, Gansu Province, has revised its urban planning scheme based on the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift, saving more than two-thirds of the investment.
    Baiyin City's initial plan was to uniformly plan the road network of the entire urban area into a checkerboard-style grid, insisting on straight and uniform lines, so that the construction of roads had to cross hills and gullies, requiring a large amount of earthwork for filling and excavation. At the same time, the standards of this initial plan were too high, with too many buildings and wide roads, forcing the state to increase investment.
    The new plan tries to combine with reality as much as possible, with roads curving where they should and straightening where they should, so that the amount of earthwork is reduced by more than 60% compared to the original. Many roads have been changed to alleys, squares have also been reduced, most of the buildings have been changed to bungalows, and housing standards have also been lowered accordingly.
    Baiyin City is now being constructed according to the new plan.

    白银市修改城市规划方案
    据新华社兰州3日电  甘肃省白银市根据勤俭建国方针，重新修改了城市规划方案，节省了投资三分之二以上。
    白银市的初步规划是把整个市区的路纲，一律规划成棋盘式的方格形，强求笔直划一，使道路的修建既越丘又跨沟，需作大量的填挖土方。同时，这个初步规划的标准也过高，楼房多，马路宽，使国家不得不增大投资。
    新的规划尽量结合实际，道路该弯的就弯，该直的就直，这样土方量比原来节省60％以上。很多马路改为小巷，广场也减少了，楼房大部分改为平房，房屋标准也随之降低。
    现在白银市正按新规划建设。
