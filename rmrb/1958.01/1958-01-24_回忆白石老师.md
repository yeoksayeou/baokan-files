    Remembering Teacher Baishi
    Lou Shibai
    It has been four months since the death of the outstanding contemporary people's artist Qi Baishi. Browsing through the exhibition of his late works, I am filled with endless emotions. As a student, I spent nearly twenty-five years with Teacher Baishi day and night. I deeply know that his remarkable achievements in art were earned through much arduous labor. Therefore, I would like to share some of my experiences with him as a token of my respect and mourning for my teacher.
    Baishi's exploration in art was extremely tenacious and diligent, and also very humble. He often used "not belittling modern people, cherishing ancient people" as his motto. However, he also advocated "I go my own way, my brushstrokes must have my own method." This means that one must not only humbly learn from the ancients, but also have creativity. This was his guiding principle throughout his life. For example, in his poem inscribed on a portrait of Da Dizi (Shi Tao), there is the line "Burning incense, I wish to bow as a student," which shows the extent of his admiration for Da Dizi. In addition, he also diligently studied the cold and detached style and refined brushwork of Xu Qingfent (Xu Wei), Zhu Xuege (Zhu Da), and absorbed the painting methods and styles of Wu Changshuo. In one of his poems, he said:
      Qingfent and Xuege are far from mortal realms,
      Old Cangshuo has unique talent in his old age.
      I wish to be a running dog in the netherworld,
      To be reincarnated under the tutelage of these three masters.
He also noted in the poem: Zheng Banqiao had a seal that read: "Zheng Xie, a running dog under Xu Qingfent." This fully illustrates his admiration for these three painters, but he did not imitate them. Instead, he integrated their strengths, re-created, and formed his own school.
    The old man's attitude towards creation was also very serious and conscientious. Especially when painting figures, he would definitely make a draft first. The draft paper was mostly old wrapping paper, and a draft would be revised many times to obtain an accurate image before he started painting (such as the draft of Zhong Kui Scratching His Back in this exhibition). He didn't just paint once, but painted again and again, and the brush and ink were also modified as he painted, to make it as perfect as possible. Therefore, many of his works, although similar in composition and image, have their own refinement and characteristics in his brush and ink. From this, it can also be felt that the old man used brush and ink to express likeness, rather than simply engaging in the literati habit of playing with brush and ink for the sake of it. This is especially evident from the changes in his paintings of shrimp and crabs.
    Teacher Baishi was not only like this in his own creation, but also in his teaching of students. When I first started learning to paint from him, he told me: "When you learn to paint, don't just learn my superficial skills. You must also learn from the ancients, even the works of unknown painters. As long as there is something good, you should write it down or sketch it down, and you will naturally become a master in the future." At that time, I thought that the old man probably didn't want to teach me to learn from him! In fact, this is precisely the old man's artistic purpose. He has always opposed the behavior of simply imitating others.
    Once, I saw the old man painting magpies, and a plum blossom and magpie painting attributed to Guyue Keren was hanging on the wall. He introduced me, saying, "This person is an unknown painter from my hometown who has passed away. This plum blossom is too vulgar to be taken, but the brushwork and spirit of this magpie can be compared with Bada. I still want to learn from him now." This learning attitude gave me a great education. Another time, when I first started learning to paint meticulous insects, the old man looked at a mantis I painted and asked me: "Have you counted how many fine veins there are on the mantis's wings? Have you carefully looked at the large thorns on the mantis's arms?" He also said, "When the mantis preys, it relies on the large and small thorns on its arms to clamp the small insects, but you have drawn these large thorns in the wrong place. Not only can it not catch insects, but it will also injure its own small arms." This shows the old man's deep observation of small insects. Therefore, he often said, "Without understanding the life of animals and not sketching from life, it cannot be painted." What a serious criticism and teaching! At that time, the old man may have felt that such criticism would make me feel embarrassed, and then said to me: "You come to me to learn to paint, and I must be like a barber, I must comb your hair, from top to bottom, strand by strand, to the end." These words really made me feel his warmth and strong sense of responsibility towards his disciples.
    When the old man encouraged us to learn, he once said, "Painting and calligraphy require long-term hard work and research. Don't be satisfied with temporary achievements. You must change again and again to create your own unique style." He said, "In my early years, I learned calligraphy from He Shaoji, and later I learned from Jin Dongxin. Finally, I learned from Li Beihai. I put the most effort into writing Li Beihai's Yunhui Stele. I practiced every day with my hand on the brush, until the characters I copied on paper could be mostly matched with the rubbings on the stele without any difference. It can be said that I practiced until I was at home, but now the characters I write still need to change." At that time, he was also looking at Zheng Gukou's calligraphy, and once taught his son to make a double outline of a Zheng Gukou ink trace that he had borrowed for him. The old man's spirit of learning is also reflected in seal engraving. He remembered that when he learned to engrave seals, he went through a difficult struggle. When he was about thirty-four years old, he asked Ding Bagong (Bagong was a title of honor in the Qing Dynasty) to engrave a seal for him, but this Bagong looked down on this painter who was born as a carpenter, and said that the stone seal was not ground flat, and refused to engrave it. The old man carefully ground it again and again, but he always used the excuse that it was not flat and needed to be ground again. The old man said, "When I was a carpenter, the first thing I had to learn was to sharpen the blades of axes and chisels. Steel can be ground flat, let alone stone." So he began to learn to engrave seals himself. At that time, he didn't have money to buy seal ink and stone seals, so he used castor oil to mix litharge and cinnabar (litharge and cinnabar were cheap colors) to replace seal ink, and used Chu stones from Nanquan, his hometown, as stone seals. After engraving, he polished them, and after polishing, he engraved them again. The brick floor in the room was covered with stone slurry. In terms of seal engraving technology, he did not consider it a literary affair, but truly understood the advantages of Han seals. Therefore, he was not harmed by the three words "imitation, creation, carving," but created more boldly and formed his own school. He said to me: "Learning to engrave seals is like a quick sword cutting off a dragon, a Kun knife cutting jade. Carving stone is like silkworms eating mulberry leaves, the sound is 'zi zi', which is the happiest thing."
    After liberation, he became more diligent in his creation. In order to express his love for peace, he began to paint peace doves. To this end, he specially spent a day going to the home of one of his students to familiarize himself with the life of pigeons, and observed the postures and characteristics of pigeons from various angles. He also said to everyone: "Remember that pigeons have twelve tail feathers." The old man's mood did appear younger, and the artistic conception of his creations improved. For example, the "Frog Croaking Ten Miles Out of the Mountain Spring" and "Lotus Root Reflection" in this exhibition, especially the "Farm Tools," are not only vigorous in brush and ink, but also show the old man's familiarity and love for rural life. The painting is full of the feelings of the working people. Judging from the size and content of the paintings, the old man preferred to paint large-format paintings, with richer and more lively content, and more full of love for life. The hundred flowers and peace doves in this exhibition are obvious examples. It is a pity that Teacher Baishi has passed away, but his bold creative spirit and works will last forever.

    回忆白石老师
    娄师白
    当代杰出的人民画家齐白石去世已经四个月了。当我浏览他老人的遗作展览时，引起了我无限的感触。因为作为一个学生，我曾和白石老人朝夕相处了将近二十五年。我深深地知道他在艺术上的卓越成就，是经历了许多艰苦的劳动才换得到的。所以我想谈谈和他相处时的一些体会，以作为我对于老师的敬爱和悼念。
    白石老人在艺术上的探求，是非常顽强和刻苦的，同时也非常虚心，他常以“不薄今人，好古人”为格言。但是他也主张“我行我道，下笔要我有我法”。这就是说既要虚心向古人学习，又必须要有创造性，这是他一生创作的指南针。例如在他题大涤子画像的诗中就有“焚香愿下师生拜”的句子，可见他对大涤子的推崇的程度。此外，他还努力地学习了徐青藤、朱雪个等的冷逸格调和洗练的笔墨，也吸取了吴昌硕的画法和风格。在他的一首诗里曾这样说：
      青藤雪个远凡胎，
      老缶衰年别有才。
      我愿九原为走狗，
      三家门下转轮来。并且在诗里自注：郑板桥有印文曰：“徐青藤门下走狗郑燮”。这又充分说明了他对这三位画家的推崇，但是他并没有模仿他们，而是溶会了他们的优点，重新创造，另成一家。
    老人的创作态度，也非常严肃认真。尤其是在画人物时，创作前一定先起草稿，稿纸大都是利用旧包皮纸，一张草稿要改正很多次，求得形象准确后才开始画（如这次展品中钟馗搔背图的稿子）。画也不只画一次，而是画了再画，笔墨也是随画随改，以求其尽美为止。所以他的作品有很多尽管章法形象雷同，但是在他的笔墨上，每张有每张的洗练和特色。从这里也体会到，老人是以笔墨表达形似，而不是以单纯玩弄笔墨的文人习气为能事。尤其从他画的虾蟹中的一变再变，更可以说明这点。
    白石老人不仅自己创作如此，他在教导学生方面也如此。当我最初向他学画时，他就告诉我说：“你学画不要专门学我的皮毛，古人的东西也要学，那怕是无名画家的作品，只要是有一点好的地方，就应当记下来，或是勾下来，将来自然可成一家。”当时我心里在想，恐怕是老人不愿意教我学他罢！其实这正是老人在艺术上的宗旨，他一向反对以因袭别人为能事的行为。
    有一次我看老人在画喜鹊，墙上挂着一幅属名古月可人的梅花喜鹊。他给我介绍说：“这个人是我乡里的一个已故去的无名画家，这幅梅花是俗不足取，但是这只喜鹊的笔墨神形，可同八大媲美，我现在还是要学学他。”这种学习态度给了我很大的教育。还有一次，我初学画工笔草虫，老人看了我画的一只螳螂，他问我：“你数过螳螂翅上的细筋有多少根？仔细看过螳螂臂上的大刺吗？”又说：“螳螂捕食时全靠两臂上的大小刺来钳住小虫，但是你把这大刺画的不是地方，它不但不能捕虫，相反还要刺伤自己的小臂。”可见老人对小虫观察的深入。所以他常说“不了解动物的生活，不去写生，是画不成的。”这是多么严肃的批评和教诲呵！当时老人可能感觉这样的批评会使我很难看，继而又对我说：“你来向我学画，我就要像一个理发师一样，一定要把你的头发，从上到下，一根根的给你梳通到底。”这几句话，真使我感到他对弟子的温暖和强烈的责任感。
    当老人鼓励我们学习时，曾这样说过，“书画之事，是要长期的刻苦钻研，不要满足一时的成就，要一变再变，才能独创一格”。他说：“我早年写字学何绍基，后来又学金冬心，最后我学李北海，以写李北海云麾碑时下的工夫最大，每天手不离笔，一直练到把我在纸上临的字，与碑帖上拓的字套起来看大部分都能吻合无差为止，可谓练到家了，但是现在我写的字还要变。”那时他又在看郑谷口的字，并且曾经教他的儿子把借来的一张郑谷口的墨迹，替他双勾下来。老人这种学习的精神，同样也表现在刻图章方面。记得他当年学刻印的时候，是经过一番艰苦斗争的。他在三十四岁左右曾找丁拔贡（拔贡是清朝时的功名名称）请他代为刻一方印，但是这个拔贡，却看不起这位木匠出身的画匠，推说石章磨的不平，不给刻。老人一再仔细地磨，他总是以不平要再磨为推辞。老人说：“我作木匠时，首先要学会磨斧凿之刃，钢铁都能磨平何况石头。因此开始自己学刻印。那时没有钱买印泥和石章，于是自己用蓖麻油调了石黄和章丹（石黄、章丹都是便宜的颜色），来代替印泥，利用家乡南泉?的楚石作石章，刻后复磨，磨后又刻，屋里的砖地满成了石浆。在刻印技术上，他不认为是文人余事，而真正领悟了汉印优点，因此不为“摹、作、削”三字所害，而是更大胆的创作，独成一家。他对我说：“我学刻印犹如快剑断蛟，昆刀截玉，刻石如蚕食桑叶，其声滋滋，为最快事也。”
    解放后，他在创作方面更加勤奋。为了表达他对和平的热爱，而开始画和平鸽。为此，他曾特意的花了一天时间，到他学生的家里去熟悉鸽子的生活，并从各个角度去观察鸽子的姿态特征，他还对大家说：“要记清鸽子的尾毛有十二根。”老人的心情确实显得更年青了，创作的意境更提高了，如这次展品中的“蛙声十里出山泉”、“荷花倒影”等，尤其是那幅“农具”不只是笔墨遒劲，而且更表现出老人对农家生活的熟悉和热爱，画中充满了劳动人民的感情。从画幅的大小和内容来看，老人的作品更喜爱画大张幅的画，内容更加丰富而热闹，更充满了对生活的热爱，这次展品中的百花与和平鸽就是明显的例子。可惜白石老人已经与世长辞了，但是他的大胆创造精神和作品将永世长存。
