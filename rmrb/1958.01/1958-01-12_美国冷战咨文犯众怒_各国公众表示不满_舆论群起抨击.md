Xinhua News Agency report: Eisenhower's Cold War-insisting State of the Union address has aroused anger and dissatisfaction among the public in various countries.

    The Syrian "Al-Noor" newspaper commented in its editorial on the 10th regarding U.S. President Eisenhower's State of the Union address: Just when the world is seeking to ease tensions after the Soviet Union put forward peace proposals, Eisenhower announced his dangerous plan for war preparations.

    The "Al-Jamahir" newspaper said in its editorial on the 10th that Eisenhower's State of the Union address contained nothing new regarding the interests of humanity and peace, but it contained many things that illustrate the reactionary policies of the United States.

    The "Al-Alam" newspaper also pointed out in its editorial on the 10th: "The President's (Eisenhower's) refusal to change his attitude towards banning nuclear weapons tests and holding East-West leaders' meetings proves that the United States still insists on implementing its policy of strength."

    The Indonesian "Suluh Indonesia" newspaper pointed out on the 11th, in commenting on the State of the Union address delivered by U.S. President Eisenhower on the 9th, that Eisenhower acknowledged the current weak position of the Western bloc. The "Bintang Timur" said that Eisenhower's State of the Union address mentioned that the U.S. military expenditure will increase greatly, which will make the American people face difficult days of inflation.

    The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" criticized U.S. President Eisenhower's State of the Union address delivered on the 9th, saying that the address "lacks anything inspiring" and it is "difficult not to feel greatly disappointed" after reading it. The newspaper expressed regret over the U.S. attitude. "Tokyo Shimbun" expressed disappointment with Eisenhower's State of the Union address. It pointed out in its editorial that the call for holding a summit conference of various countries initiated by the Soviet Union is growing louder and louder in the world. The newspaper expressed hope that the United States should recognize that the summit conference will eventually be held.

    The "New York Times" correspondent in London reported that President Eisenhower's State of the Union address aroused more questions than trust in Britain.

    The "New York Times" reporter pointed out that the London "Times" editorial believed that Eisenhower's message seemed to be completely contrary to Bulganin's proposal to convene a high-level meeting. He wrote that British and other Western officials believed that "the international situation requires the Washington government to take more realistic diplomatic actions."

    The London "Times" reporter, in commenting on the U.S. attitude, said that there was no sign from Washington that it would take any new initiative. President Eisenhower's silence on East-West negotiations and specific international issues "may indicate the extent to which U.S. foreign policy has become rigid since Russia launched its artificial satellites."

    Many newspapers in Paris pointed out that the Soviet Union's peace proposals are far more remarkable than Eisenhower's State of the Union address. The influential bourgeois newspaper "Le Monde" believes that the Soviet Union continues to take the initiative on the issue of East-West negotiations, while the West is doing everything possible to delay this issue. It believes that the concise remarks made by the Soviet Union to the world are extremely persuasive.

    The "New York Times" said on the 10th that the message most lacks "inspiring power." The newspaper believes that Eisenhower wants to get his "foreign aid" plan and extend the Reciprocal Trade Act through this Congress, which will be "more laborious than the struggles over past legislative issues."

    美国冷战咨文犯众怒
    各国公众表示不满　舆论群起抨击
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：艾森豪威尔坚持冷战的国情咨文，引起了各国公众的愤怒和不满。
    叙利亚“光明报”10日的社论评论美国总统艾森豪威尔的国情咨文说：正当在苏联提出了和平建议以后，全世界都在谋求缓和紧张局势的时候，艾森豪威尔宣布了他的危险的备战计划。
    “群众报”在10日的社论中说，对于有关人类和和平的利益来说，艾森豪威尔的国情咨文中并没有什么新的东西，但是其中包含了许多说明美国反动政策的东西。
    “旗帜报”10日也在它的社论中指出：“（艾森豪威尔）总统拒绝改变他对禁止核武器试验和举行东西方领导人会谈的态度证明，美国仍然坚持执行它的实力政策。”
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”11日在评论美国总统艾森豪威尔在9日发表的国情咨文时指出，艾森豪威尔承认了目前西方集团的软弱地位。“东星报”说，艾森豪威尔的国情咨文提到了美国的军费支出将大大增加，这会使得美国人民面临通货膨胀的艰难日子。
    日本“读卖新闻”11日批评美国总统艾森豪威尔9日发表的国情咨文说，这个咨文“缺乏任何使人鼓舞的东西”，看了“难以不起大失所望的感觉”。这家报纸对美国的态度表示遗憾。“东京新闻”对艾森豪威尔的国情咨文表示失望。它在社论中指出，世界各国要求举行苏联倡议的各国首脑会议的呼声越来越高涨。这家报纸表示希望美国应该认识到首脑会议终究是要举行的。
    “纽约时报”驻伦敦记者报道，艾森豪威尔总统的国情咨文在英国与其说引起了信任，不如说引起了问题。
    “纽约时报”记者指出，伦敦“泰晤士报”的社论认为，艾森豪威尔的咨文看来同布尔加宁关于召开高级会议的建议是完全相反的，他写道，英国和其他西方的官方人士都认为，“国际局势要求华盛顿政府采取更现实的外交行动”。
    伦敦“泰晤士报”记者在评论美国态度时说，华盛顿方面没有什么迹象表示要采取任何新的主动行动。艾森豪威尔总统在东西方谈判和具体国际问题上所表现的沉默态度“可能表明自从俄国发射人造卫星后美国外交政策的僵化到了什么程度。”
    巴黎许多报纸指出，苏联的和平建议要比艾森豪威尔的国情咨文更引人注目得多。有影响的资产阶级报纸“世界报”认为，苏联不断在有关东西方举行谈判的问题上采取主动，而西方却在这个问题上千方百计进行拖延。它认为，苏联向全世界发表的简明言论极有说服力。
    “纽约时报”10日说，这篇咨文最缺乏的是“鼓舞力量”。这家报纸认为艾森豪威尔要使本届国会通过他的“援外”计划和延长互惠贸易法，将“比过去立法问题上进行的斗争都更费力”。
