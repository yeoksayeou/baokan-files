Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, January 30th: From December of last year to mid-January of this year, farmers of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have collected enough fertilizer for over 7.5 million mu of land. Adding this to the existing fertilizer, they now have enough for over 31 million mu of land, equivalent to 40% of this year's planned planting area. Currently, tens of thousands of people are braving the bitter cold to push the manure collection and delivery campaign to a new high. The Yellow River Hetao area, which has traditionally finished delivering fertilizer to wheat fields (spring wheat) after the Spring Festival, estimates that they will complete the task before this year's festival. The Horqin Left Wing Middle Banner in the Jerim League, which has never had a tradition of delivering winter manure, is now also vigorously organizing manpower and animal power to deliver fertilizer.

The manure collection campaign is being combined with the patriotic health campaign. The old habits of "no toilets for people, no pens for livestock" in many parts of the Autonomous Region are rapidly changing. More than 16,000 new toilets and 13,000 new pigsties have been built in the Hetao area. After the members of the Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Ningcheng County dug out more than 600,000 jin of fertilizer from a stinking ditch that had existed for many years, the sanitary conditions in the village have greatly improved. After the workers in Keshiketeng Banner cleaned up more than 500,000 jin of garbage and manure from the streets and alleys to support the peasants, the city's "three dirty areas" (dirty streets, dirty toilets, and dirty livestock pens) were transformed into "three clean areas," presenting a refreshing scene on the streets.

    内蒙古积肥送粪形成高潮
    许多村子和街道卫生状况焕然一新
    据新华社呼和浩特30日电　从去年12月到今年1月中旬，内蒙古自治区各族农民积攒的肥料已经够上七百五十多万亩地。加上原有的肥料，一共已够上三千一百多万亩地，等于今年计划播种面积40％。目前，成千上万的各族农民，不顾天寒地冻，正在把积肥送粪运动推向新的高潮。一向习惯于到春节以后才送完麦田（春小麦）肥料的黄河后套，估计今年春节前可以全部送完。从来没有送冬粪习惯的哲里木盟科尔沁左翼中旗，现在也大力组织人力、畜力送肥。
    积肥运动结合爱国卫生运动，自治区许多地方“人无厕所，畜无圈”的积习正在迅速改变。河套地区目前已新修厕所一万六千多个，新盖猪圈一万三千多个。宁城县友谊农业社的社员们，从一个多年的臭水坑里挖出六十多万斤肥料后，使村子里的卫生状况，得到很大改善。克什克腾旗的职工们，把街头巷尾的五十多万斤垃圾和粪土，打扫起来，支援农民后，历年来城市里的“三脏”（街道脏、厕所脏、畜圈脏）变成了“三光”，街道上呈现出一片清新景象。
