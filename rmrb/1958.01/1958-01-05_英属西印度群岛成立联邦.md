Xinhua News Agency, Spanish Port, Trinidad Island, January 4th: The British colony of the British West Indies, located in the Caribbean Sea, formally established the West Indies Federation on January 3rd, with Lord Hailes, appointed by the British government, serving as Governor-General.

This federation is composed of British Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Windward Islands, and the Leeward Islands, with a population of approximately four million. The British West Indies were originally ruled separately by several governors dispatched by the British government. In recent years, the national and democratic movements of the local people have been on the rise. In order to maintain its colonial rule and to counter the encroachment of American forces, the British government proposed the plan to establish the West Indies Federation long ago.

The federation will hold parliamentary elections on March 25th this year.

    英属西印度群岛成立联邦
    据新华社4日讯　特立尼达岛西班牙港消息：位于加勒比海的英国殖民地英属西印度群岛1月3日正式成立了西印度联邦，由英国政府任命的赫耳斯勋爵担任总督。
    这个联邦是由英属牙买加、特立尼达及多巴哥岛、巴巴突群岛、温德华群岛和利华德群岛组成的，人口大约四百万。英属西印度原来由英国派遣几个总督分别统治。近年来，当地人民的民族、民主运动日益高涨。英国政府为了维持它的殖民统治，同时也为了对付美国势力的侵入，早就提出了成立西印度联邦的计划。
    联邦将在今年3月25日举行议会选举。
