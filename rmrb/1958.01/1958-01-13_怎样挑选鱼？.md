    How to choose fish?
    Fish are divided into sea fish (saltwater fish) and river fish (freshwater fish). Yellow croaker, ribbonfish, shark, mullet, and pomfret are sea fish; carp, crucian carp, white fish, silver carp, eel, black carp, yellow catfish, and bighead carp are river fish. The fish sold in the market are further divided into live fish, fresh fish, frozen fish, and salted dried fish.
    How to identify the quality of fish?
    When buying live fish, observe how the fish swim. The best fish swim in the lower layer of the water, and their gill covers rise and fall evenly when breathing. Slightly inferior fish swim in the upper layer of the water, with their mouths close to the water surface and their tails drooping. Fish floating horizontally on the surface of the water are either short of oxygen due to too few water and too many fish, or are about to die.
    Fresh fish (freshly dead fish): Completely fresh fish have scales that are complete, tight, and shiny. The eyes are bright; the gill covers are tightly closed, and the gills are bright red or pink. The abdomen is not swollen, the body is stiff, and the flesh is firm and elastic. Fish with poorer freshness have scales that are slightly detached, dull eyes, sunken eyeballs, open gill covers, and yellowish-gray or pale gills; the flesh is softened, sometimes with exposed bones and detached spines, and no elasticity. Fish with the lowest freshness have loose scales, shrunken eyeballs, grayish-white or dark red gills, and soft flesh (when pressed, the depression does not recover).
    Frozen fish: If the surface is clean, the flesh and spines are firm, the luster is obvious, and it has the characteristics of the fish itself (such as the golden yellow color of carp, and the yellowish-white color of yellow croaker), then it is good fish. If the fish's abdomen turns black, the flesh detaches from the spines, and it has a foul odor after thawing, then it is spoiled fish.
    Salted dried fish: Good salted dried fish have a clean fish body surface, firm flesh, normal color, and no insects or putrid odor; if the fish body surface has a yellowish-red mucous membrane or insects, and is heavily contaminated, then it is a deteriorated substandard product. (Cui Sen)

### 怎样挑选鱼？

    怎样挑选鱼？
    鱼，有海鱼（咸水鱼）和河鱼（淡水鱼）之分。黄花鱼、带鱼、鲨鱼、鮻鱼和八代鱼等是海鱼；鲤鱼、鲫鱼、白鱼、鲢鱼、鳝鱼、青鱼、黄钻鱼和胖头鱼等是河鱼。市场上卖的鱼，又分为活鱼、鲜水鱼、冻鱼和咸干鱼几种。
    如何识别鱼的质量好坏呢？
    买活鱼时，要看鱼游动的情况。最好的鱼是游于水的下层，呼吸时鳃盖起伏均匀。稍差的鱼是游于水的上层，鱼嘴贴近水面，尾部下垂。横漂在水面上的鱼或因水少鱼多氧气不足或为即将死亡者。
    鲜水鱼（死鲜鱼）：完全新鲜的鱼是鱼鳞完整而紧密有光。眼睛明亮；鳃盖紧闭，鳃色鲜红或粉红。腹不膨胀，鱼体硬直，肉质坚实而有弹性。鲜度较差的鱼是：鱼鳞稍有脱落，眼睛灰暗，眼球塌陷，鳃盖敞开，鳃色灰黄或苍白；肉质软化，有时露骨离刺，而无弹力。鲜度最低的鱼是：鱼鳞松弛，眼球收缩，鳃色灰白或暗红，肉质松软（用手按之陷坑不能平复）。
    冻鱼：如表体清洁，肉刺牢固，光泽明显，并具鱼类本身之特色（如鲤鱼金黄色，黄花鱼黄白色），则为好鱼。鱼融解后，腹黑、离刺、有恶臭气味者，则为变质鱼。
    咸干鱼：鱼体表面清洁，肉质坚实，颜色正常，无虫、无腐败臭味者是好的；如鱼体表层呈现黄红色粘膜或生虫，以及污染严重者就是变质次品。（崔森）
