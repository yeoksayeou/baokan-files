Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Amidst government turmoil, British Prime Minister Macmillan left London on the 7th for a five-week visit to Commonwealth countries including India, Pakistan, Ceylon, New Zealand, and Australia. Macmillan arrived in New Delhi on the afternoon of the 8th and will stay there for four days, holding talks with Indian Prime Minister Nehru.

According to Reuters, Macmillan and the leaders of the Commonwealth countries he is visiting will discuss important issues in the international situation. The talks will involve the Baghdad Pact and the Manila Pact, as well as "many issues ranging from world disarmament to Commonwealth trade."

On the eve of his visit to Southeast Asian Commonwealth countries, Macmillan made a statement in a radio address on the 4th that he could conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. The British "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" called Macmillan's statement "the opening drumbeat for his upcoming visit to Asian countries" and "diplomatic seasoning." Commentators have pointed out that one of the purposes of this approach is to win the favor of public opinion in these countries.

    麦克米伦找政治资本
    前往英联邦国家访问
    据新华社8日讯　英国首相麦克米伦7日在政府发生动荡的情况下离开伦敦，前往印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰、新西兰和澳大利亚等英联邦国家进行五个星期的访问。麦克米伦已于8日下午到达新德里，他将在那里停留四天，同印度总理尼赫鲁会谈。
    据路透社报道，麦克米伦和他要访问的英联邦国家的领导人将要讨论国际局势中的重要问题。会谈将涉及巴格达条约集团和马尼拉条约集团的问题以及“从世界裁军一直到英联邦贸易的许多问题”。
    麦克米伦在前往东南亚英联邦国家访问的前夕，曾经在4日发表的广播演说中作了可以同苏联缔结互不侵犯条约的表示。英国“每日电讯与晨邮报”把麦克米伦的这种表示称作是“即将访问亚洲国家的开场锣鼓”和“外交调料”。各方面评论都指出，这种做法的目的之一就是要博得这些国家舆论的好感。
