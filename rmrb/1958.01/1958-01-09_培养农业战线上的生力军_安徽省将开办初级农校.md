    Cultivating New Forces on the Agricultural Front
    Anhui Province to Open Junior Agricultural Schools
    (Our Hefei dispatch, January 7th) The education department of Anhui Province has decided to open nearly sixty junior agricultural schools in 1958. The mission of these schools is to cultivate a force of new recruits for the agricultural production front who have socialist consciousness, culture, basic knowledge, and skills in agricultural production. After graduation, they will participate in agricultural production in their own villages and communes, undertaking the important task of developing agricultural production, promoting agricultural technology reform, and realizing the agricultural development program. Therefore, the schools will enroll this year's senior primary school graduates and rural educated youth with senior primary school graduation level who are determined to participate in agricultural production, and will give priority to admitting senior primary school graduates who have participated in agricultural production for more than two years and have performed well in labor. In order to cultivate the working people's own knowledge force and combine labor with knowledge, these schools stipulate that the study time for each academic year is eight or nine months, and the time for participating in labor production in combination with study is two or three months. Professional courses related to agricultural knowledge account for more than half, and the rest are ordinary courses equivalent to junior high school culture, graduating in three years. These schools will be scattered in the rural areas of various counties throughout the province. School buildings will make full use of existing public housing, and will vigorously promote building schools through labor and running schools diligently and thriftily. Higher normal schools in Anhui Province are also preparing to appropriately revise their teaching plans to cultivate teachers who can adapt to the needs of rural middle schools and agricultural schools.

    培养农业战线上的生力军
    安徽省将开办初级农校
    本报合肥7日电　安徽省教育部门决定1958年开办近六十所初级农校。这些学校的任务是为农业生产战线培养一批有社会主义觉悟、有文化、有农业生产基本知识和技能的生力军，他们在毕业后将参加本乡本社的农业生产，担当起发展农业生产和推动农业生产技术改革、实现农业发展纲要的重要任务。因此，学校招生的对象是那些有志于参加农业生产的本届高小毕业生和具有高小毕业程度的农村知识青年，并且将优先录取已经参加农业生产两年以上，在劳动中表现良好的高小毕业生。这些学校为了培养劳动者自己的知识队伍，使劳动与知识相结合，规定每学年的学习时间为八九个月，结合学习参加劳动生产的时间是两三个月，有关农业知识的专业课程占一半以上，其余是相当于初中文化的普通课程，三年毕业。这些学校将分散在全省各县的农村中。校舍将尽量利用现有公房，并将大力提倡劳动建校、勤俭办学。安徽省的高等师范学校也准备适当修订教学计划，培养适应农村中学和农业学校需要的师资。　　　（于风）
