    Running Sports Undertakings Should Also Be Thrifty
    Gu Hua
    Practicing diligence and thrift in all undertakings is our national policy. Running sports undertakings is, of course, no exception. However, many units, in their work, single-mindedly demand high standards, large scale, comprehensiveness, and newness, emphasizing ostentation and extravagance, wasting a great deal of the state's property.
    Some places, regardless of the development of sports activities, regardless of design and construction capabilities, insist on building large-scale "gymnasiums" or "sports palaces." After they are built, the utilization rate is very low, the area for non-sports activities is large, and equipment is not well maintained, resulting in much waste and loss. In Nanning, Guangxi Province, a stadium was built with an investment of more than 330,000 yuan, covering an area of 16,000 square meters. Due to design and construction errors, the stands were falling apart before it could even be used, and as a result, it could not be used at all. Sports colleges and universities also have many wasteful phenomena in terms of land occupation, basic construction, instruments, equipment, administrative expenses, and living management. In sports competitions, there are also phenomena such as poor planning, large budgets, high standards, excessive time, and too many staff.
    Sports work is a new undertaking in our country. Lack of experience makes it inevitable to produce some waste and losses in the work. But the important thing is that some people do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of building the country with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift. Some people think that if you want to get things done, you can't be afraid of spending money. When it comes to running sports, they reach out to the state for money, and when they get it, they don't use it thriftily. Some sports workers, coaches, and athletes, when they have not cultivated excellent athletes or when their performance cannot be improved, do not study how to improve from training methods, etc., but always complain about poor venues, equipment, and materials, and poor living conditions. Some grassroots sports teams also demand to buy better sports equipment, sportswear, etc. Under the domination of this kind of thinking, it is impossible not to cause a lot of waste.
    We must not emphasize that it is a "new undertaking" and ignore the various wasteful phenomena in the current sports work. Precisely because it is a "new undertaking," opposing waste early and establishing the idea of running sports with diligence and thrift will be more beneficial to the development of sports in the future. We must thoroughly examine and eliminate all kinds of wasteful phenomena. Under the principle of spending less money or no money, we must be diligent and thrifty, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and find ways to overcome difficulties, so as to further develop mass sports activities.

    办体育事业也要勤俭
    顾华
    勤俭办一切事业，是我们建国的方针。办体育事业当然也不例外。但是，有不少单位在工作中，一味要求高、大、全、新，讲排场，比阔气，浪费了国家很多财产。
    有些地方，不管体育活动开展情况如何，不管设计和施工力量如何，也要建立规模宏大的“体育馆”或“体育宫”。修起来以后，使用率很低，非体育活动面积很大，器材没有很好的保管，造成许多浪费和损失。广西省南宁修了一个体育场，投资三十三万多元，占地一万六千平方公尺，因为设计和施工有错误，建成后还没有使用，看台就四崩五裂，结果根本不能使用了。体育院校在占地面积、基本建设、仪器、器材、行政开支、生活管理等方面也存在许多浪费现象。在运动竞赛中，也有计划不周，预算较大，标准偏高，时间过长，工作人员过多等现象。
    体育工作在我国是一项新事业，经验不足，在工作中产生一些浪费和损失，也是难免的。但是重要的是有些人对于勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的意义认识不足。有些人认为要办事就不能怕花钱，一谈到办体育，就伸手向国家要钱，要来又不节俭使用。有些体育工作者、教练员、运动员，在没有培养出优秀运动员或成绩不能提高时，不从训练方法等方面研究如何改进，总是埋怨场地、设备和器材不好，生活不好等。有些基层运动队也要求买较好的运动器材、运动服装等。在这种思想支配下，就不可能不造成许多浪费。
    我们决不能强调是“新事业”就忽视目前体育工作中的各种浪费现象。也正因为是“新事业”，及早反对浪费，树立勤俭办体育的思想，对于今后开展体育运动事业会更有利。我们要彻底检查和消灭各种浪费现象。在少花钱、不花钱的原则下，克勤克俭，发动群众，依靠群众，想办法克服困难，进一步开展群众体育运动。
