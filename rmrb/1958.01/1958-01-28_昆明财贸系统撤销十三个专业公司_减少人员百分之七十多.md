    Kunming Finance and Trade System Abolishes Thirteen Specialized Companies, Reducing Personnel by More Than Seventy Percent
    (Our Dispatch) The Kunming City Finance and Trade System has abolished its thirteen affiliated specialized companies, reducing personnel by 71.34%.
    Since late December of last year, various specialized companies in Kunming City have launched special discussions and debates among cadres on the issue of organizational structure. Many problems were exposed during these discussions. For example, some companies emphasized "matching counterparts," establishing both a business section and a procurement section, resulting in unclear responsibilities and frequent mutual blaming and shirking of responsibilities. Because the division was too detailed, cadres had nothing to do. In the financial accounting section of the Food Company, some accountants recorded only two entries a day. In addition, the cumbersome organization and complicated procedures caused significant harm to the work. For example, in the Medicinal Materials Company, one type of report required twenty-six stamps, leading to inflexible work scheduling and frequent artificial stockpiling or stockouts of goods.
    In order to strengthen the grassroots and reinforce business departments, the Kunming City leadership decided to abolish the thirteen specialized companies under the Commerce and Service Bureaus and establish five administrative and enterprise-integrated management bureaus. In this way, the number of sections was reduced from one hundred and thirty to forty-one, and the number of section personnel was reduced by 71.34%. The proportion of section personnel to the total number of employees decreased from 23.33% to 7.4%.
    After the company-level organization was abolished, the management bureau directly led the state-owned stores, processing plants, and warehouses, greatly reducing the levels of administration.
    The six companies under the Commerce Bureau, including the Department Store Company, were officially abolished on New Year's Day and were replaced by wholesale stores for department stores, hardware, etc., directly led by the bureau. The Welfare Bureau and the Trade Bureau were also merged earlier this month.

    昆明财贸系统撤销十三个专业公司
    减少人员百分之七十多
    本报讯　昆明市财贸系统撤销了所属十三个专业公司，人员减少71.34％。
    昆明市各个专业公司从去年12月下旬起，在干部中展开了关于机构体制问题的专题鸣放和专题辩论。在鸣放中揭露出不少问题。如有的公司强调“对口”，成立了业务科和采购科，结果两科职责不清，经常相互扯皮，推诿责任。由于分得过细，干部无事可做。食品公司财会科有的财会员一天只记两笔账。此外，由于机构庞杂，手续繁多，对工作的危害也相当严重。如药材公司有一种表报要盖二十六个图章，致工作调度不灵，商品经常发生人为的积压或脱销现象。
    昆明市的领导方面为了充实下层，加强业务部门，决定撤销商业、服务两局所属的十三个专业公司，成立五个行政、企业合一的管理局。这样，科室由一百三十个减为四十一个，科室人员减少71.34％，科室人员占职工总数，由23.33％降为7.4％。
    公司一层机构撤销以后，管理局就直接领导国营门市部、加工厂、仓库，层次大大减少了。
    现在商业局所属的百货等六个公司已于元旦正式撤销，分别成立由局直接领导的由百货、五金等批发商店。福利局、贸易局也已于本月初合并。
