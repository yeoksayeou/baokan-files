Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 21st: The Jilin Province Social Thrift Exhibition opened in Changchun City on the 19th.

The exhibition is divided into seven pavilions: Grain, Cotton Cloth, Coal, Timber, Electricity Saving, Birth Control, and Savings. This is the largest exhibition ever held in Jilin Province.

In each exhibition hall, people can see the achievements and experiences of the people of Jilin Province in implementing the policy of "building the country with diligence and thrift, managing the household with diligence and thrift." In 1957, the savings amount of the people of the entire province increased more than sixteen times compared to 1952. The Grain Pavilion introduced the experiences of saving grain in various aspects, including more than 140 advanced experiences of using wild plants to replace grain for feeding pigs alone. The 76 tailoring methods introduced in the Cotton Cloth Pavilion can generally save eight inches to one foot and two inches of cotton cloth. The Coal Pavilion used many models to introduce more than 120 types of coal-saving experiences for boilers, kilns, collective cooking, and household heating and cooking. In addition, the Timber Pavilion, the Electricity Saving Pavilion, and the Birth Control Pavilion also used extremely vivid facts to introduce various advanced practices and experiences.

The exhibition exposed some serious wasteful phenomena. For example, due to the chaotic grain system and lax management, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant wasted more than 13,000 catties of grain per month. On October 18th last year, among the people who had meals at the First Automobile Plant at noon, more than 2,700 people mixed into the cafeteria using cinema seat numbers, expired grain coupons, and random scraps of paper as fake entrance passes, and forced their way into the cafeteria to eat, including many small vendors. The leftover rice grains and steamed bread crusts swept up from the twelve cafeterias of this factory after one meal weighed more than 20 catties.

The Jilin Province Social Thrift Exhibition is scheduled to be on display for six months.

    介绍节约经验  揭发浪费现象
    吉林举办社会节约展览会
    新华社长春21日电　吉林省社会节约展览会19日上午在长春市开幕。
    展览会分粮食、棉布、煤炭、木材、节电、节育和储蓄七个馆。这是吉林省规模最大的一次展览会。
    在各个展览馆里，人们看到吉林省人民贯彻“勤俭建国、勤俭持家”方针的成绩和经验。1957年全省人民的储蓄额比1952年增加了十六倍以上。粮食馆里对各方面节约粮食的经验作了介绍，其中仅用野生植物代替粮食喂猪的先进经验就有一百四十多种。棉布馆里介绍的七十六种剪裁方法，一般都能节约棉布八寸到一尺二寸。煤炭馆里用许多模型介绍了锅炉、窑业、集体炊事和家庭取暖、做饭的省煤经验一百二十多种。此外，木材馆、节电馆和节育馆，也以极其生动的事实，介绍了各种先进作法和经验。
    展览会上揭露了一些严重的浪费的现象。如第一汽车制造厂由于粮食制度混乱、管理不严，每月浪费粮食达一万三千多斤。去年10月18日中午在第一汽车厂进餐的人中，有二千七百多人是用电影座号、过期粮券、乱纸片假充入门证混进食堂和硬闯进食堂用饭的，其中还有许多小商贩。这个厂十二个食堂一顿饭扫起的剩饭粒、馒头皮就有二十多斤。
    吉林省社会节约展览会预定展出六个月。
