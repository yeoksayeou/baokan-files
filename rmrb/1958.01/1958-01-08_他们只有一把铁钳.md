They Only Had a Pair of Iron Pliers

　　In our construction endeavors, some units have excellent conditions and have achieved great results; however, there are also units with very poor conditions that have also achieved outstanding results. Some people only shout slogans but dare not overcome difficulties; others don't shout slogans but conquer difficulties. Regarding these two situations, I say the latter possesses true skill. This is the impression I gained from the Hebei Affiliated Enterprise Station of the Transportation Department of the Baotou Iron and Steel Company a few days ago.
　　The construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Base is constantly fighting against difficulties and racing against time. The heavy task of material supply relies on the railway. However, in the spring of 1957, besides the laid tracks and two locomotives with a few train cars, nothing else existed. During February and March, a railway transportation team of more than fifty people was transferred from Northeast China to Baotou Steel. There were no tools for work, no houses to live in, no place to work, and not even a stove for boiling water. People arrived at the dried-up Kündelen River and stood on the sandy land of Sanheleng. Recalling the time in Anshan Steel, when they had everything they needed, they couldn't help but worry when looking at the Wula Mountain in this remote area.
　　The Party organization deeply understood these difficulties and, even more, understood its own class, believing that the slogan of building the country and managing the household through diligence and frugality would inspire the entire working class and unleash a fountain-like force. The Party organization led them to visit the cave dwellings of the Baotou Railway Third Bureau road construction team near the Kündelen Temple. They saw how the vanguard troops had struggled in the cold and windy desert region, how they had built the Baotou-Bayan Obo line, and how they had connected the steel rails to the Baotou Steel factory area.
　　The workers understood the significance of transferring them from over three thousand kilometers away to Baotou. They borrowed two earthen houses from the electrical installation company. The station, locomotive, and track maintenance departments, everything a railway station needed, were crammed into these few square meters of space for offices, sleeping quarters, everything. At night, the snoring of sleepers, the laughter of card players, and the two telephones connecting and directing operations with various parties all mixed together in a chaotic jumble. Thus, the work began. However, these "wonderful" days were short-lived. The electrical installation company needed the houses, and before the desks of the Affiliated Enterprise Station could be moved out, the desks of the landlord moved in.
　　At a Party meeting, the policy of running enterprises through diligence and frugality was discussed, and the workers decided to build their own houses with their own hands. So workers, engineers, and cadres worked together to make adobe bricks, mix mortar, and use waste wood to make pillars, doors, and windows. More than fifty railway transportation workers overcame the idea that "I drive trains, I don't know how to do this kind of work" and took on the work of masons and carpenters. Ten and a half rooms completely made of earth, ash, and waste wood were built, providing offices, warehouses, a kitchen for boiling water, a dining shed, and a place to play table tennis. Like the buildings next door, they could withstand wind and sand, block the sun, and were equally bright, just not as magnificent or elegant in appearance.
　　Work could begin again, and more than fifty pairs of eyes smiled. However, they saw that they had no tools. What to do? Make the tools with their own hands! Suí Yǒngzhì, an old worker who usually didn't say more than a few words, took out a treasure he had brought from Northeast China—a pair of iron pliers. Under the sandy sky, he built a red furnace and bought a bellows. The purplish-blue flames danced at the mouth of the furnace, and sparks flew on the anvil. Two hundred and fifty-eight pieces, including all kinds of hammers and pliers, were made, and the train started moving. When I arrived, Master Suí's red furnace was no longer in the open air, but in a newly built, bright room with glass doors and windows. The things in the room were arranged in an orderly manner, just like the name of this old worker, everything was always in order no matter what corner you looked at. I looked at the various tools he had made himself, and they were indeed beautifully crafted.
　　"Master Suí, were you originally a blacksmith?"
　　He replied very sparingly with two words: "Riveter."
　　"In the past, when you worked outdoors, what did you do when it rained or snowed?" I wanted to get him to say a few more words.
　　He still cherished his words: "It rarely rains here."
　　I was determined to hear him say a few more words, so I picked up his iron pliers and said, "This pair of iron pliers overcame many difficulties, it made a great contribution."
　　He smiled faintly and simply said nothing, as if what I said was superfluous.
　　I went to the earthen house of the track maintenance section and met the section chief, Wáng Shùsēn. I visited their small workshop. The room was very small, and two or three people could barely turn around inside. The top and surrounding areas were filled with their creations: wooden mallets, hammer handles, iron forks for moving sleepers, fork hooks for moving steel rails, and track gauges.
　　"This track gauge has three uses," Section Chief Wáng showed me the adjustable dimensions, "The ones you buy can only measure the distance between the rails." He then pointed to the wooden washbasins, the steamers for heating food, the desks, benches, and blackboard in their office—which was also the workers' classroom for the station—and said, "These are all made by ourselves."
　　"Does the section have a carpenter?"
　　"No."
　　"Were these tools bought?"
　　"In the beginning, we didn't have any tools. We borrowed a small axe and a chisel from others."
　　"Is there anyone who knows how to forge iron?"
　　"No. We waited until Master Suí's red furnace was idle during the lunch break, in the evenings, and on Sundays to forge them ourselves."
　　"The tools are very well made, and you have everything."
　　"There's no other way, some things can't be bought here. Rather than waiting, it's better to do it ourselves." In this way, they produced thirteen types of track maintenance tools, including one hundred and eighteen pieces. Not only did the house have glass doors and windows, and the room had daily necessities, but there was also a beautiful blackboard sign outside, like a memorial arch.
　　On a section of track fenced with iron mesh on the west side of the station, a locomotive being repaired was parked above a concrete-cast tunnel. Section Chief Zhāng told me that this was their open-air workshop for repairing locomotives. In the past, I had also visited several locomotive repair factories, and this was the first time I had seen such a simple workshop. He said that the locomotives needed to be inspected and repaired every month, but they didn't have their own repair equipment. In the beginning, they had to ask the Third Railway Bureau of Baotou for help, which cost 300 yuan each time and they had to wait until they had spare time, often delaying transportation tasks. Now that they had their own workshop, they could completely repair and clean them themselves. Throughout the summer, they saved the state a large amount of expenses and also guaranteed the transportation tasks. I asked them, if they could manage working in the sun during the summer, but the winters in the grasslands had always been cold and unforgiving. They smiled and pointed to a small earthen house by the road and a square barrier made of branches about ten feet or so in front of the house:
　　"We first disassemble the parts and move them to that small warm house. The water inside doesn't freeze. After cleaning and repairing them, we wait for the two hours at noon when the weather is warmer to install the parts. Wind and cold don't matter. Don't underestimate those two hours at noon and this windbreak, they are all serving socialism!"
　　I went to the station's office and saw technician Dǒng Chánggēng carefully making a washing oil tank out of tinplate. He said to me: "We can't buy it here, so we'll make do. With this thing, washing the trains won't waste oil."
　　Their slogan of everyone doing one thing has become a habit for everyone in this small station. To solve the problem of insufficient train cars, they, along with the cadres of the Transportation Department, took on the task of unloading coal. To save six temporary workers, saving the state 360 yuan per month, they did the work of adding water themselves. They did everything, using the wisdom of the working class and the socialist labor enthusiasm, answering the idea of "I'm not doing this kind of work" with "We are all-rounders." Under this good atmosphere of diligence and frugality in running enterprises, everything is educating and influencing young intellectuals for socialism. In front of the warehouse door, I met several students who had just graduated this year from railway colleges in Jinan, Tianjin, and Shanghai. They were borrowing a flatbed cart from another unit, carrying two bottles of oxygen and lubricating oil, and returning while chatting and laughing. I asked Tán Qìngfāng, who came from Jinan, how life was here. He said with satisfaction:
　　"When I graduated, I heard that the conditions here were very poor. After coming here, I think it's very good."
　　I have also met some young students who regretted coming here. However, these young people, seeing what kind of thinking the workers are using to labor, will also learn to use what kind of thinking to labor, and will feel that this place is so good! In the office of the track maintenance section, dozens of workers were listening to Mǎ Zhànwén, a graduate of Tianjin Railway Engineering College, give a technical lesson—frost damage. He happily told me: "Everyone wants to improve their knowledge quickly to meet the greater tasks of 1958."
　　In this way, they built houses, made tools, and started the trains moving from a pair of iron pliers and borrowing an axe and a chisel from others. In November, they overfulfilled the annual transportation task of 400,000 tons by 82,900 tons. They proposed to complete another 50,000 tons of tasks in December and guarantee to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure in the first year. By the time I wrote this article, they had already achieved it.
　　At the Baotou Iron and Steel Base, I saw a unit that worked silently and diligently, a grassroots organization that had true skill and did not rely on money to replace political work. They are full of confidence, prepared everything to welcome the beginning of the more glorious Second Five-Year Plan, and full of confidence in responding to the great call of the Party Central Committee to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and major industrial products within fifteen years. To build the grassland steel capital ahead of schedule, they are accelerating their pace forward.

    他们只有一把铁钳
    阮辛竞
    在我们的建设事业中，有的单位什么条件都很好，做出了好成绩；但也有的单位，什么条件都很不好，也做出来出色的成绩。有些人，光叫喊而不敢克服困难；也有些人，不会叫喊而战胜了困难。对这两种情况，我说后者是有真本事。这是前些日子，我到包头钢铁公司运输部的河北附属企业车站所得到的感想。
    包头钢铁基地的建设，时时刻刻都在和困难斗争，和时间赛跑。繁重的材料供应工作，要靠铁路来负担。可是，在1957年春天，除了已铺成的轨道和有了两台机车、少数车皮之外，什么都没有。二三月间，五十多人的铁路运输队伍，从东北调到包钢来了。工作，没有工具；住，没有房子；办公，没有地方，连烧开水，也没有个炉灶。人们来到干涸了的昆都仑河，站在三河楞的沙地上，想起在鞍钢时，要啥有啥，嘴说手拿。现在经过了三千多公里的路程，来到塞外，怎么不望着乌拉山发愁呢？
    党的组织，很了解这些困难，更了解自己的阶级，相信勤俭建国勤俭持家的口号，会鼓舞全体工人阶级，发挥出如同喷泉似的力量。党的组织领着他们到昆都仑召庙附近，参观了包头铁路三局筑路队住的窑洞。他们看见了先头部队，曾经怎样在寒冷风沙地区斗争，怎样修成了包头——白云鄂博线路，怎样把钢轨和包钢厂区联接起来的。
    工人们了解了为什么要从三千多公里以外，调他们来包头的意义。他们从电装公司借了两间土房子。车站、机务、养路，凡是一个火车站必需有的部门，办公的桌子，睡觉的床铺，一切都塞在这个几平方公尺的房子里。晚间，睡觉的鼾声，打扑克牌的笑声，两台与各方面联系、指挥调度的电话，哗啦哗啦搅在一起。就这样开始了工作。可是，这样“美好”的日子，也为时甚短。电装公司要用房子了，附属企业车站的办公桌还没有搬到外头的时候，房主的办公桌搬进来了。
    在一次党的会议上，讨论了勤俭办企业的方针，工人们决定：用自己的手盖起房子来。于是工人、工程师和干部在一起，打土坯，拌灰浆，利用废木料做柱子，做门窗。五十多个铁路运输职工，克服了“我是开车的，不会干这个工种”的思想，做了泥瓦匠、木匠的工作。十间半完全用土灰和废木料做成的房子盖出来了，有了办公室，有了仓库，有了烧开水的伙房，有了饭棚和打乒乓球的地方了。和旁边的楼房一样，能避风沙，能挡日晒，而且同样明亮，只是外貌没有那样雄伟，没有那样秀气。
    工作又可以开始了，五十多双眼睛都笑开了，可是，他们看见自己的手上，什么工具都没有。怎办呢？用自己的手，打出工具来！隋永秩，这个平常多一句都不肯说的老工人，拿出从东北带来的一件宝贝——一把铁钳，在风沙的天空下，垒起了一个红炉，买了一只风箱。紫蓝色的火舌，在炉口舞动，火星在铁砧上飞蹦，二百五十八件，包括各种各样的锤子、钳子出来了，火车开动起来了。当我去到的时候，隋师傅的红炉，已经不在露天下，而是在一间刚盖好的、有玻璃门窗的、十分明亮的房子里，房里的东西，安排得有条有理，和这位老工人的名字一样，随便看那一个角落，永是很有秩序。我看了他自制的各种工具，确是做得很漂亮。
    “隋师傅，你原来是锻工么？”
    他很节约地说了两个字：“铆工。”
    “过去露天干活，下雨下雪怎办？”我想多引他说几句话。
    他还是很爱惜他的语言：“这里雨很少。”
    我下决心要听他多说两句话，我拿起他的铁钳说：“这把铁钳，克服了很多困难，它立了大功。”
    他淡淡地笑了一下，干脆不说了，好像我说的话，都是多余的。
    我到了养路段的土房里，见到了段长王树森。我参观了他们的小工房。房子很小，两三个人进去就转不过身来。顶上和周围都架满放满他们的作品：有木?、锤柄、搬枕木的铁叉、搬钢轨的叉钩、还有轨距尺。
    “这轨距尺，有三种用处”，王段长把活动的尺码让我看，“买的只能量轨路距离。”他又指着木制的洗脸盆、热饭用的笼屉、他们的办公室——也是这个车站的工人课堂——的桌子、板凳、黑板说：“这都是自己做的。”
    “段里有木工么？”
    “没有。”
    “这些工具是买的么？”
    “开头，什么工具都没有。我们借人家一把小斧，一管凿子。”
    “有会打铁的？”
    “没有。我们等隋师傅的红炉中午休息、晚上和星期天闲下来的时候，自己去打出来的。”
    “工具做得很好，而且什么都有了。”
    “没办法，有的在这里买不到。让等着，不如自己动手做。”就是这样，从他们的手里，生产出来十三种包括一百十八件养路用的工具，不但房子有了玻璃门窗，屋里有了日用家具，屋外还有了面漂亮的、像牌坊似的黑板报牌。
    在车站的西边，一截用铁网围着的轨道上，停着一台正在修理的机车，下面是一道洋灰灌铸的坑道。张段长告诉我，这就是他们修理机车的露天工场。过去，我也曾经到过几个机车修理厂，像这样简陋的工场，是第一次见到。他说机车每月都要检修一次，可是自己没有修理设备。开始的时候，要到包头托三局帮助，每次要花三百元，而且要等人家有空余的时间，常耽误运输任务。现在有了自己的工场，完全可以自己修洗了。整个夏天，给国家省了一大笔开支，也保证了运输任务。我问他们，夏天晒着干活，还能将就过去，但是草原的冬天，历来是寒冷不肯让人。他们笑着指路旁的一间小土房，指着房子前面一面用枝条编成的，有十来尺左右的方形屏障说：
      “我们先拆下机件，搬到那间小暖房里，里面水不冻，擦洗修好之后，等中午的两小时，天气暖和些，把机件装上去。风起、天冷都不碍事，你不要小看中午那两小时和这面风障，都在为社会主义服务！”
    我到了车站的办公室，看见技术员董长庚在仔细地用白铁做一个洗车的油槽。他对我说：“在这里买不到，凑合凑合，有了这个东西洗车就不浪费油。”
    他们提出每人做一件事的口号，在这个小小的车站里，成了每一个人的生活习惯。为了解决车皮不够用，他们和运输部的干部在一起，担负起卸煤的任务。为了节省六个临时工，每月给国家省下三百六十元，他们自己干了加水的工作。他们什么都做了，用工人阶级的智慧，社会主义的劳动热情，以“我们是全才”来回答了“我不是干这个工种”的思想。在这样勤俭办企业，一点一滴都在为社会主义的好风气下，教育影响了青年知识分子。我在仓库的门前，遇见了几个今年刚从济南、天津、上海铁路院校毕业的学生，他们借别个单位的板车，拉着两瓶氧气和滑机油，说说笑笑地回来。我问从济南来的谈庆芳，在这里生活怎样。他满意地说：
    “毕业时，听说这里条件很差。来了这里之后，觉得很好。”
    我也遇见过一些青年学生，来到这里之后，懊悔了。但是，这几个青年，看见工人们是以什么思想在劳动，他也会学着以什么思想来劳动，就会觉得这里是多好呀！在养路段的办公室里，几十个工人，在听从天津铁道工程学院毕业的马占文上技术课——冻害。他高兴地告诉我：“大家都想赶快提高知识，迎接1958年的更大任务。”
    就是这样，他们从一把铁钳和借人家一把斧子、一管凿子，盖出房子，打出工具，把火车开动起来。在11月，把四十万吨的全年运输任务，超额完成八万二千九百吨。他们提出在12月内再完成五万吨的任务，并保证第一年就做到收支平衡。在我写这篇文字的时候，他们已经达到了。
    在包头钢铁基地，我看见了一个不声不响，埋头苦干的单位，一个有本事的，不是靠钱来代替政治工作的基层组织。他们满怀信心，准备好一切来迎接更光辉的第二个五年计划的开始，满怀信心地响应党中央提出在十五年后，我们在钢铁和主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的伟大号召。为提前把草原钢都建成，他们正加快脚步在前进。
