    "War and Peace" Staged in Sofia, "Prague Spring" Actively in Preparation
    The Sofia National Opera in Bulgaria recently staged the opera "War and Peace" by Soviet composer Sergei Prokofiev, based on Tolstoy's famous novel. This opera brings the great historical events that shook the first half of the 19th century to the stage, vividly recreating many brilliant historical figures.
    The Sofia National Opera began preparing and rehearsing this opera long ago. They received personal guidance from Pokrovsky, the general director of the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre, listened to recordings of the Leningrad Opera House's performance of the play, and carefully studied Tolstoy's original work and a large amount of historical reference materials. To perform this opera, five hundred singers, musicians, dancers, and stage artists were mobilized. There were fifty outstanding singers in the cast of soloists alone. Bulgarian People's Artist Mikhail Popov, who is already familiar to Chinese audiences, played General Kutuzov, and Popova played Natasha.
    The 1958 "Prague Spring" International Music Festival will begin on May 11. Preparations are now underway. As this year marks the 30th anniversary of the death of the famous Czech composer Leoš Janáček, many of his works will be performed during the festival.
    The "Prague Spring" International Music Festival plays a significant role in promoting cultural exchange and mutual understanding between East and West. Famous musicians from all over the world will be invited to participate in the festival. So far, eleven foreign band conductors, fourteen soloists, and some outstanding bands have accepted invitations. The entire program of the festival will include twenty orchestral concerts, twenty vocal and instrumental recitals, chamber music concerts, and twelve grand concerts held in various palaces in Prague.
    Yugoslavia will produce 170 films this year. The production of feature films will exceed any year after the war. It is also planned to shoot two widescreen films and co-produce some films with other countries.
    In recent years, the Yugoslav film industry has developed greatly and has been welcomed abroad. In the past two years, thirty-four Yugoslav films have been shown in twenty-two countries. Last year, Yugoslavia participated in international film exhibitions held in Cannes, Berlin, Venice, and Karlovy Vary. Some of the films exhibited, such as "Valley of Peace", "Big and Small", and "Guilty Money", were well received. Last year, in addition to its own films, Yugoslavia also released 130 foreign films.

    “战争与和平”在索非亚上演  “布拉格之春”正积极筹备中
    保加利亚索非亚国家歌剧院在最近演出了苏联作曲家普罗科菲耶夫根据托尔斯泰名著而创作的歌剧“战争与和平”。这部歌剧把震荡着十九世纪上半叶的伟大历史事件搬上了舞台，生动地再现了许多光辉的历史人物。
    索非亚国家歌剧院很早就开始了这部歌剧的准备和排演工作。他们得到了莫斯科大剧院总导演波克罗夫斯基的亲自指导，收听了列宁格勒歌剧院演出这个剧的录音，并仔细地学习了托尔斯泰的原著和大量的历史参考资料。为了演出这部歌剧，动员了五百名歌唱演员、演奏家、舞蹈家和舞台艺术工作者。在剧中担任独唱演员的就有五十名杰出的歌唱家。已为中国听众所熟悉的保加利亚人民艺术家米哈伊尔·波波夫扮演库图佐夫将军，波波娃扮演娜塔莎。
    1958年的“布拉格之春”国际音乐节将在5月11日开始举行。现在筹备工作已着手进行。由于今年适逢捷克斯洛伐克著名作曲家利奥·雅那契克逝世三十周年纪念，在音乐节期间，将演奏许多这位作曲家的作品。
    “布拉格之春”国际音乐节在促进东西方之间的文化交流和相互了解上有显著作用。来自世界各国的著名音乐家都将应邀参加音乐节。到现在为止，已经有十一位外国乐队指挥、十四名独唱家和独奏家，以及一些杰出的乐队接受了邀请。音乐节的全部节目将包括二十次管弦乐音乐会，二十次独唱、独奏会，室内音乐演奏会和在布拉格各宫殿内举行的十二次大音乐会。
    南斯拉夫今年将摄制一百七十部影片。特制的故事片的产量将超过战后的任何一年。预计还要拍摄两部宽银幕电影，并同别的国家合作拍摄一些影片。
    几年来，南斯拉夫的电影事业有了很大的发展，并在国外受到欢迎。在过去两年内，曾经有三十四部南斯拉夫电影在二十二个国家中上映。去年南斯拉夫参加了在戛纳、柏林、威尼斯和卡罗维发利举办的国际电影展览。展出的一些影片，如“和平之谷”、“大与小”、“罪恶的金钱”等都受到了欢迎。去年，除了自己拍摄的电影之外，南斯拉夫还上映了一百三十部外国电影。　（陈）
