    Sheep and Goats

    Here are pictures of a sheep and a goat, as well as a chessboard diagram. Please make sixteen chess pieces yourself (using paper or clay), and write a number on each piece (from 1 to 16, as shown in the diagram). Even numbers represent a flock of sheep, and odd numbers represent a flock of goats (it is best to separate them with different colors).

    When you place the pieces on the chessboard, you will see that the two flocks of sheep and goats are mixed together. Now, you are required to separate the sheep and goats, and you must abide by the following rules:

    1. A chess piece can be moved to an empty space, or jumped over another piece to the empty space in front, but it cannot be taken off the chessboard.

    2. Chess pieces can only move or jump along the straight lines connecting the circles. Diagonal lines that are not connected by straight lines cannot be traversed.

    3. The game is only over when the central space marked "5" has no chess piece, and the upper group is all goats, and the lower group is all sheep.

    If you are interested, why not give it a try?

### 绵羊和山羊

    绵羊和山羊
    这里有一幅一只绵羊和一只山羊的图，还有一幅棋盘图。请你自制十六枚棋子（用纸剪、用泥作均可），并在每个棋子上写明一个数字（从1到16，见图），数字中的双数代表一群绵羊，单数代表一群山羊（最好用不同的颜色把它们分开）。
    你把棋子放在棋盘上，就可以看到两群羊是混杂在一起的。现在要你把绵羊和山羊分开来，分的时候，必须要遵守下列规则：
    1、棋子可以移到一个空格里，或者越过一个棋子跳到前面一个空格里去，但是，不能从棋盘上拿开；
    2、棋子只能沿着连接圆圈的直线移动或跳跃，没有直线相连的对角线不能通行；
    3、等到中央那个标有“5”的空格子没有棋子，而上面一群全是山羊，下面一群全是绵羊的时候，游戏才算结束。
    如果你有兴趣，不妨试一试。
