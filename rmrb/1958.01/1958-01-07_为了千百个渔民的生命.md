For the Lives of Thousands of Fishermen

	On the afternoon of December 12, 1957, a typhoon of force eight or nine suddenly struck the Zhoushan fishing grounds. Many fishing boats that had gone out to sea were caught off guard and swept away by the violent winds and waves before they could raise their sails and return to port. More than four thousand fishing boats sheltering in the northern ports were also unable to return to the southern ports in time, and many were destroyed by the storm. Many fishermen fell into the water, crying for help.

	After receiving the news, the leadership of the Zhoushan-stationed Navy immediately dispatched more than ten warships to rush to the dangerous area for rescue. Upon receiving the order from his superiors, Hu Miandi, Deputy Commander of a certain unit, personally directed the rescue throughout the night. He also specially sent the Operations Section Chief to the fishing grounds that night, braving the force ten winds and waves, to organize the rescue.

	In the pitch-black night, the warships traveled along routes they had never taken before, passing through treacherous rocky straits. They had to turn on searchlights and radars, groping their way forward, checking every reef on the nautical charts to rescue the fishermen in distress.

	"A dark shadow has been spotted ahead!" reported Sun Dequan, the gunner who was on lookout at the bow of a gunboat. He had been standing there for more than ten hours. To avoid being swept into the sea by the huge waves, he tied himself tightly to the iron pillar at the bow with a rope. His eyes were swollen and red from the seawater, but he finally spotted a distressed fishing boat for the fourth time. The mast of this fishing boat was broken, and the five people on board were helpless, watching as the boat was blown towards the open ocean by the storm. The gunboat tried every means to throw the cable over, and finally rescued the fishermen one by one.

	Another boat, number twenty-three, had a light and small hull. The huge waves sometimes rolled it onto high crests, and sometimes threw it into deep troughs. The people on the boat, however, disregarded the danger and rescued five fishing boats that were about to sink. In the evening, the wind and waves became even greater. Boat number twenty-three discovered another small boat, being tossed around in a whirlpool by the huge waves. Boat Captain Fan Debao quickly wiped the seawater from his face and decisively ordered: "Prepare life jackets and cables!" The boat sped towards the small boat like an arrow. At that moment, a sudden crosswave crashed over, and the boat lurched violently. Helmsman Wang Xingen quickly turned the rudder to the right, and boat number twenty-three emerged from the huge wave. The storm and rain mixed with seawater drenched the sailors. They dragged the small boat out of danger and went to rescue other fishing boats.

	When the storm broke out, boat number five hundred and twenty-seven was still docked in the harbor, and some of the personnel on board had gone ashore on leave. After receiving the task of rescuing the fishermen, the personnel who had gone ashore immediately ran back. It took only sixteen minutes from receiving the order to leaving the harbor. The sailors said: "Rescuing people is like fighting a fire, we must strive not to waste a minute or a second." They fought in the stormy sea for a whole day and night. Later, many people became seasick and vomited, but they still insisted on the rescue work.

	The naval observation and communication station on Chengshan Island took on the communication work for the entire fishing ground during the rescue. Usually, only one person was on duty at the signal station, but at this time, all the signalmen came to work at the same time, working tirelessly day and night.

	After the storm, Liu Jilong, Deputy Chief of Staff of a certain unit, learned that twenty fishing boats were still missing in the fishing grounds, and personally directed the warships to search for them, bringing back all the missing boats.

	At the same time, the local troops launched a large-scale donation campaign, sending money, cotton clothes, and food to the fishermen. The naval troops also sent many engine mechanics to help the fishermen repair damaged boats, which deeply moved the fishermen. Qian Shengjun, a fisherman from Jiangsu, said: "The People's Liberation Army is the savior of the fishermen. In the future, I will definitely go fishing even harder, strive for a bumper harvest, and repay you."

	This sudden storm was unprecedented in decades. It is said that in 1935, the Zhoushan fishing grounds suffered a storm disaster that was much smaller than this one. Because the Kuomintang government did not care about the lives and deaths of the fishermen, several hundred people died in the fishing grounds that year, resulting in heavy losses.

	This time, with the rescue and support of the local government and stationed troops, the fishermen suffered very little loss. Now, the wounds brought about by this storm have healed, and the fishermen have plunged into production with full confidence and high morale. In the past ten days or so, the Zhoushan Special District alone has caught nearly 500,000 dan of fish. The fishermen of the entire fishing ground have also completed 89% of their full-season production targets. At present, they are carrying out a production increase competition of averaging 500 dan per boat per hour, to repay the support of the Party, the government, and the army.

    为了千百个渔民的生命
    陆其明　白天氛
    1957年12月12日下午，舟山渔场突然袭来八九级巨风，许多出海捕鱼的船只，来不及扬帆归航，就被狂风巨浪卷走了。停在北面港口避风的四千多只渔船，也来不及开回南港，其中不少已被风暴摧毁了。许多渔民落入水中，呼喊救命。
    驻舟山海军领导机关得到消息以后，立即派出十余艘舰艇，急赴险地抢救。某部副司令员胡绵弟大校接到上级命令后，整夜亲自指挥抢救。还特派作战科长当夜冒着十级风浪赶到渔场，组织抢救。
    在漆黑的夜里，舰艇往来在从未走过的航线上，穿过惊险的石峡，不得不开放探照灯和雷达，摸索着前进，查遍海图上的每一个礁石，抢救遇难的渔民。
    “前方发现一个黑影！”正在一个炮艇的艇首了望的枪炮兵孙德权报告说。他站在那里，已经十个多小时了。为了不被巨浪卷下海，他用麻绳把自己牢牢地捆在艇首的铁柱上。他的两眼被海水浸得红肿，终于又第四次发现遇难的渔船。这条渔船的桅杆断了，船上五个人束手无策，眼看着船被暴风吹向远洋去。炮艇想尽办法把缆绳掷过去，才把渔民一个个救出来。
    另一艘二十三号艇，艇身轻小，巨浪时而把它卷上高高的浪峰，时而把它抛下深深的浪底，艇上的人们却不顾危险，一连抢救出五只将要沉没的渔船。傍晚，风浪更大了，二十三号艇又发现一只小船，被巨浪打得在漩涡里滴溜溜地转。艇长范德宝用手迅速地擦去脸上的海水，果断地命令：“准备好救生衣、缆绳！”艇像箭似地向小船驶去。这当儿，突然一个横浪打将过来，艇身霍地栽倒，操舵手王信根猛地把舵向右一转，二十三号艇这才从巨浪里钻出来，暴风雨夹着海水，浇了水兵一身。他们把这只小船拖出险境，又去营救其他的渔船。
    当暴风骤起的时候，五百二十七号艇还停泊在港口，艇上部分人员，已放假上岸去了。接到抢救渔民任务后，上岸人员立即跑回来。从接到命令到离开港口，仅仅用了十六分钟。水兵们说：“救人如救火，争取不浪费一分钟一秒钟。”他们一直在暴风雨的海洋里搏斗了一昼夜。到后来，许多人都晕船，呕吐了，虽然这样，他们还是坚持了抢救工作。
    溗山岛海军观通站，在抢救中担任了整个渔场的联络工作。平时信号台只有一个人值班，这时所有信号员同时都来工作，昼夜不息地忙碌着。
    风暴过后，某部副参谋长柳继龙闻知渔场还有二十只渔船下落不明，又亲自指挥各舰艇寻找，把失落的船只全部找回。
    与此同时，驻地各部队掀起了大规模的捐献运动，把钱、棉衣、食物送到渔民手里。海军部队还派出许多轮机兵，帮助渔民修补破损船只，使渔民深受感动。江苏渔民钱生俊说：“解放军是渔民的救星。今后我一定要更好地去捕渔，争取大丰收，来回答你们。”
    这次突然的风暴，是几十年来所未见的。据说1935年，舟山渔场曾受过一次比这小得多的风灾，由于国民党不管渔民死活，那年渔场死了几百人，损失惨重。
    这次，渔民在当地政府和驻军抢救、支援下，损失很小。现在，这次风暴带来的创伤已经平复，渔民们信心百倍、情绪高昂地投入了生产。最近十几天中，仅舟山专区捕鱼已近五十万担。全渔场渔民也完成了全汛期生产指标的89％。目前他们正在开展着每小时每船平均五百担的增产竞赛运动，来回答党、政府和军队的支援。
