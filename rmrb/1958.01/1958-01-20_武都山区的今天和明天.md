On the way to the Wudu mountain area, passing through Minxian County (a county in the Wudu Special District), we visited the Dalong Agricultural Cooperative on the outskirts of the city. In 1957, this cooperative harvested 50,000 jin of Chinese angelica, worth 250,000 yuan, averaging 21 yuan per person based on the cooperative's population. The firewood cut in the same year, converted into cash, averaged 15 yuan per person. The grain produced, after deducting public grain and seeds, still averaged no less than 600 jin per person. In addition, there was income from sheep, pigs, cattle, bees, and poultry. In short, this was a very prosperous cooperative. I thought to myself: perhaps this is the most profitable typical cooperative in this county?

Upon arriving at the Wudu District Committee, when we mentioned the Dalong Cooperative's high income, the comrades from the District Committee told us, "It's not particularly outstanding! In Minxian County, the income from Chinese angelica alone averages 25 yuan per person based on the entire county's population."

In Wudu, we continued to visit several agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperatives and reviewed some written materials, and then we learned about the abundance of forestry, animal husbandry, and local specialty resources in the Wudu mountain area. Here, there are densely forested mountains, lush grasslands, and river valleys suitable for farming and sericulture. There are diverse economic forests and medicinal materials. Trees that can produce oil include tung oil trees, lacquer trees, Chinese tallow trees, and Chinese pistache; trees that can be used for papermaking include paper mulberry, mulberry, and bamboo; trees that can extract tannin include oak, smoke tree, chestnut, and larch. There is cork oak whose bark can be used to make cork, Chinese gall which can be used as dye, and eucommia which is an effective medicine for treating high blood pressure. There are both highland crops such as highland barley and subtropical plants such as palm trees, figs, loquats, sugarcane, and oranges. The Wudu mountain area produces no less than one hundred and twenty to thirty kinds of local specialties, of which more than twenty can be exported. In 1956, the state-owned enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives in the entire special district invested more than 22.09 million yuan to purchase local specialties. The average household could earn 115 yuan. The income from selling oranges alone in Fanchang Village, Wenxian County, reached more than 2,000 yuan, close to the total output value of the village's corn (staple food) production. Last year, Kangxian County sold 21,059 wild animal skins. The Jiajiaba Agricultural Cooperative in this county, with 66 households, has 30 paper vats, each producing 2,600 reams of handmade paper annually. This income is equivalent to 50.65% of agricultural income. This is a beautiful place rich in products and full of treasures, a mountainous area that is so worthy of people dedicating their youth to develop it!

However, what is unfair is that for a long time, the Wudu mountain area has been known for its poverty and disasters! Before liberation, people described it as a poor mountain gully where "thieves don't bother to steal, and beggars don't bother to beg"; the residents here described their lives as "no bedding on the kang, no covers on the body, nothing cooking in the pot, nothing raised in the pen!" Even after liberation, a few cadres and masses with unhealthy thoughts spread pessimistic views: "The roads are not wide and not bright, the houses on the mountains are thatched, airplanes and trains can't come, and tractors can't drive on the Wudu mountains!"

There are reasons why people say this. The cultivated land area of the Wudu Special District accounts for only 8.58% of the total area. The average is 3.2 mu of land per person, and most of it is steep and the soil is thin, so-called "seven parts stone and three parts soil." The terrain within the territory is extremely complex. The altitude ranges from 600 meters to 3,000 meters. In terms of climate, a village can experience three solar terms simultaneously: Great Heat, Lesser Heat, and End of Heat. Here, floods, droughts, birds, and animal disasters occur frequently. In addition, the rule of feudal forces before liberation, coupled with exorbitant taxes and levies and high rents and heavy interest, caused agricultural production here to stagnate for a long time, the production of local specialties to be on the verge of collapse, and the people's lives to be extremely impoverished. Since liberation, grain production in the mountain area has gradually increased, and people's lives have greatly improved. However, due to the limited cultivated land area in the mountain area, production is still controlled by natural disasters. In 1956, Gansu Province generally achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, but some areas in the Wudu Special District still suffered disasters. In the Yangba District of Wudu County, more than 64% of farmers needed relief successively. At present, in some places in the Wudu mountain area, the living standard of a typical middle peasant family is generally a living expense of 2.5 to 3 yuan per person per month (no money is spent on firewood, vegetables, or smoking). This makes some mountain farmers have insufficient understanding of the future of mountain area construction, and a few people have moved down to the plains or into cities. What can be done to enable all farmers to embark on the road to genuine prosperity? This is an arduous task that needs to be solved urgently by the local Party committee in this area.

In view of the fact that rural areas have already achieved cooperativization and the country's construction requires a large amount of industrial raw materials and consumer goods, and that the counties within Wudu are now accessible by automobiles, and the Baoji-Chengdu and Tianshui-Lanzhou railways also pass by the door, the Wudu District Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to greatly develop diversified economies on the premise of ensuring sufficient grain self-sufficiency. The first step is to comprehensively plan and draw a happy vision for the mountainous area, encourage the masses to build confidence in the mountainous area, and then deeply, specifically, and meticulously lead the masses to gradually transform the poor mountainous area into a prosperous mountainous area.

In the winter of 1956 and the spring of 1957, the Longnan Mountain Area Planning Work Group of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China came to Wudu, and the District Committee also organized several work groups to conduct investigations on products in the riverside, mid-mountain, and high-mountain areas. They discussed with the masses and formulated a draft plan for the development of diversified economies in the entire special district from 1957 to 1967. The plan pointed out that by 1967, the total output value of diversified economies in the entire district would be equivalent to 4.002 billion jin of grain. Averaged among the district's agricultural population, it would be 1,260 yuan per household and 261 yuan per person, equivalent to 3.7 times the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries in 1956. By that time, life in the mountain area would be just as the cooperative members themselves described it: "Prickly ash in front of the slope, willows by the river, herds of cattle and sheep all over the mountains. Eating steamed rolls and long noodles, big red quilts and floral sheets. Women and children wear floral jackets, studying culture under the electric lights. Celebrating the bumper harvest of grains, the Wudu mountain area becomes a garden!" Encouraged and promoted by the policy of developing diversified economies, some counties have now established offices for developing diversified economies to specifically study and lead this work. Many townships and cooperatives are, in accordance with this spirit, formulating plans while taking action. The eleven-year plan for the development of diversified economies of the Jiachang Senior Agricultural Cooperative in Wenxian County is positive and reliable. The Jiachang Cooperative has 238 households, 1,033 people, and cultivates 2,051 mu of land. The average is less than 2 mu of land per person, and mountainous land accounts for 65%. The plan requires that, on the premise of first ensuring increased grain production, the focus should be on developing persimmons and prickly ash, supplemented by other aspects. The economic forests operated by the cooperative include persimmons, prickly ash, yellow nectarine peaches, walnuts, mulberry trees, bamboo, and codonopsis pilosula; domestic animals and poultry include fish farming, duck raising, pig raising, rabbit raising, and beekeeping. Taking persimmons as an example, from now to 1962, it is planned to plant 12,000 trees on riverbanks, canal banks, field edges, and roadsides. The cooperative has already cultivated 400,000 seedlings. The transplanting will be completed in 1958, grafting will be completed in 1960, and fruiting will begin in 1962. In 1967, calculated at 500 persimmons per tree, 6 million persimmon cakes can be made. At two fen per cake, the annual income would be 120,000 yuan. For other fruit trees, "peaches in three years, apricots in four years, pears in five years, and prickly ash makes money in the same year," the income will be even faster. By the time the plan is realized, the annual income from economic forests and domestic animals and poultry alone can reach 683,700 yuan. Including the income from cooperative members' personal operations, the income will reach 745,500 yuan. Adding agricultural income, the total income should be above 800,000 yuan. The average is 771 yuan per person, an increase of 17 times compared to the average income of 43 yuan in 1957. Now, the cooperative has decided that Deputy Director Lin Shengmao will specifically lead diversified economies. Each production team has two fixed technicians to provide specific guidance and implement the plan. The cooperative members are very enthusiastic. They said: This plan is guaranteed to be completed because: first, we have already cultivated various tree seedlings; second, the Wenfeng Canal has water, so the survival of the seedlings is not a problem; third, we have many years of management habits and experience, plus the leadership of the Party branch and the cooperative committee, it is truly "ten out of ten"!

Recently, the Wudu Special District is brewing a discussion and revision of the entire district's plan based on the spirit of the draft National Agricultural Development Program to mobilize the masses.

The masses have been mobilized, which requires the work of various leading departments to keep up without stopping. At present, there are still some problems in the production and purchase of local specialties in the Wudu area. State-owned enterprises cannot obtain or obtain very little of some valuable products, such as musk, bezoar, and golden monkey skin; the quality and specifications of some local specialties do not meet the requirements, and there is an urgent need to improve the varieties. Comrade Qiang Zixiu, Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, who came to Wudu to inspect the work, has instructed the relevant departments: First, the work of purchasing local specialties should be put on the agenda of the Party committees at all levels and effectively managed, just like the work of purchasing grain, cotton, and oil; second, the purchasing units of state-owned enterprises must guide production and have their own nurseries and breeding farms, and must effectively undertake the task of improving varieties; third, some rare wild animals, such as golden monkeys and otters, should be properly protected so that they can breed, and artificial breeding should be tried when necessary.

The tomorrow of the Wudu mountain area will be a tomorrow of great development of diversified economies, and also a tomorrow of abundant food and clothing and cultural prosperity for the people of the mountain area!

    武都山区的今天和明天
    本报记者　柳梆
    赴武都山区途中，经过岷县（武都专区的一个县），我们顺便参观了城郊的大龙农业社。这个社1957年收了五万斤当归，价值二十五万元，按全社人口平均，每人二十一元。同一年砍的柴，折成现款，平均每人十五元。生产的粮食，扣除公粮和种籽等以后，平均每人还不下六百斤。此外，还有羊、猪、牛、蜂和家禽等的收入。总之，这是一个很富裕的社。我心里想：也许这是这个县收入最多的典型社吧？
    到了武都地委会，谈起大龙社的优厚收入，地委的同志告诉我们：“不算突出哩！岷县光当归一项的收入，按全县人口平均计算，每人就是二十五元。”
    在武都，我们继续访问了几个农林牧生产合作社，看了一些书面材料，这才知道武都山区的林业、牧业和土特产资源的丰饶。这里有森林密茂的山区，丰美的草原，宜于农桑的河谷。有种类繁多的经济林和药材。能取油的有油桐、漆树、乌桕、黄连木；能造纸的有构树、桑树、竹子；能提取鞣酸的有檞树、黄栌、板栗子和落叶松。有树皮可以制作软木的栓皮栎，有可作染料的五棓子，有治高血压特效药的杜仲。既有高寒地区的作物青稞，又有亚热带的棕梠、无花果、枇杷、甘蔗和桔子。武都山区盛产的土特产不下一百二、三十种，其中可供出口的有二十多种。1956年全专区国营企业和供销合作社用以收购土特产所投放的资金即达二千二百零九万多元。平均每一农户可得一百一十五元。文县凡昌村光是卖桔子的收入，就达二千多元，接近于这个村生产的包谷（主粮）的总产值。康县去年出售的野生兽皮即达二万一千零五十九张。这个县的贾家坝农业社，六十六户就有纸槽三十个，每个年产土纸二千六百刀。这项收入相等于农业收入的50.65％。这是一块物产丰美、遍地是宝的好地方，多么值得人们为了开发它而献出自己的青春的山区呵！
    可是，使人感到不公平的是：长久以来，武都山区竟以贫瘠多灾见称！解放以前，人们形容这里是“贼娃子过来不偷，叫花子过来不讨”的穷山沟；这里的居民形容自己的生活是“炕上没铺的，身上没盖的，锅里没下的，圈里没养的！”甚至解放以后，还有少数思想不健康的干部和群众散布悲观论调：“道路不宽又不光，山上盖的茅草房，飞机火车来不了，拖拉机开不到武都山上”！
    人们这样说，也不是没有原因的。武都专区的耕地面积只占全区总面积的8.58％。每人平均三点二亩地，而且大部分是坡陡土薄，所谓“七分石头三分土”。境内地形异常复杂。海拔从六百公尺到三千公尺。一个村庄按气候来说，同时就有大暑、小暑和处暑的三种节气。这里涝旱鸟兽的灾害频仍。加上解放前有封建势力的统治，苛捐杂税和高租重利的盘剥，这就造成这里的农业生产长久以来停滞不前，土特产品的生产也奄奄一息，人民生活极端贫困。解放以来，山区的粮食产量逐步有所提高，人民生活大大地前进了一步。但是，由于山区耕地面积有限，生产仍然为自然灾害所左右着。1956年甘肃全省普遍获得空前大丰收，可是武都专区仍然有部分地区遭灾。武都县的阳坝区就有64％以上的农民先后需要救济。目前，武都山区有的地方一般中农家庭的生活水平大体上是每人每月生活费二元五角到三元（烧柴、吃菜、吸旱烟都不花钱）。这就使得有些山区的农民对于山区建设前途认识不足，有少数人相继搬下平川或流入城市。用什么办法使得全体农民走上真正富裕的道路呢？这是摆在这个地区党委面前的一项急待解决的艰巨任务。
    中共武都地委鉴于目前农村已经实现合作化，国家建设需要大量工业原料和消费品；同时，武都境内各县已通汽车，宝成和天兰铁路也从门口经过，因此，提出在保证粮食充分自给的前提下，大量发展多种经济。首先是全面规划，画出一幅山区的幸福远景，鼓舞群众建设山区的信心，从而深入、具体、细致地领导群众逐步变贫困的山区为富裕的山区。
    1956年冬和1957年春，中共甘肃省委的陇南山区规划工作组来到武都，地委也组织了几个工作组分别到沿川、半山、高山等地区进行物产的调查。他们和群众一道商量，制出全专区从1957年到1967年多种经济发展规划草案。规划指出：到1967年，全区多种经济的总产值折合粮食四十亿零二千多斤，以全区农业户口平均分配，每户一千二百六十元，每人二百六十一元，相当于1956年农副业总产值的三点七倍。到那个时候，山区的生活正像社员们自己所描绘的那样：“坡前花椒河边柳，牛羊成群遍山沟。吃的花卷和长面，大红被子花铺单。女人娃娃穿花袄，电灯底下学文化。五谷丰登庆丰收，武都山区成花园！”在发展多种经济这个方针的鼓舞和促进下，目前有的县已经成立发展多种经济办公室，专门研究和领导这一工作。许多乡和社都根据这个精神，一面制订规划，一面行动起来。文县贾昌高级农业社的十一年多种经济发展规划就订得积极而又可靠。贾昌社二百三十八户，一千零三十三人，耕种土地二千零五十一亩。每人平均不到二亩地，而且山地占65％。规划要求：在首先保证粮食增产的情况下，以发展柿子、花椒为主，其他方面为辅。由社经营的经济林木有柿子、花椒、黄甘桃、核桃、桑树、竹子和党参等；家畜家禽有养鱼、养鸭、养猪、养兔、养蜂等。以柿子为例，从现在到1962年，计划在河边、渠边、地边、路边等处栽培一万二千株。社里已经育苗四十万株。1958年完成移苗，1960年完成嫁接，1962年就能结果。1967年每株以五百个柿子计算，可制柿饼六百万个。一个打二分钱，一年就可收十二万元。其他的果树，“桃三杏四梨五年，当年花椒赚本钱”，收益就更快了。到规划实现的时候，经济林木和家禽家畜两项，每年可收入六十八万三千七百多元。连社员个人经营的，收入将要达到七十四万五千五百多元。加上农业收入，总收入当在八十万元以上。每人平均七百七十一元。比1957的平均收入四十三元提高十七倍。现在社内决定由副主任林生茂专门领导多种经济。每个生产队固定两名技术员，具体指导，执行规划。社员们劲头很大。他们说：这个规划保证能完成，因为：第一、我们已经育好各种树苗；第二、文丰渠通水了，树苗成活没问题；第三、我们有多年的经营习惯和经验，再加党支部和社委会的领导，真是“十拿九稳”！
    最近，武都专区正在酝酿根据全国农业发展纲要修正草案的精神发动群众讨论修订全区规划。
    群众动起来了，这就要求各个领导部门的工作必须一步也不停留地跟上去。目前武都地区在土特产的生产和收购方面都还存在着一些问题。若干贵重的产品，例如麝香、牛黄、金丝猴皮等，国营企业收不到手或者收得很少；若干土特产的质量规格不合要求，亟待改良品种。前来武都检查工作的中共甘肃省委书记强自修同志已经指示有关部门：第一、要把土特产的收购工作摆到各级党委的工作日程中去，像对待粮食、棉花和油料的收购工作一样，切实地管起来；第二、国营企业的收购单位一定要指导生产，要有自己的苗圃和饲养场，要把改良品种的任务切实地担当起来；第三、有些奇珍野兽，例如金丝猴和水獭，要适当保护，使其繁殖，必要时试行人工饲养。
    武都山区的明天，将是多种经济大发展的明天，也是山区人民衣食丰足、文化繁荣的明天！
