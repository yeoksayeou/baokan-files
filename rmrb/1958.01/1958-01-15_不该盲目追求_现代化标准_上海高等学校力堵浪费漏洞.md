Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 14th – A mass upsurge of exposing waste and plugging loopholes has begun to take shape in eighteen universities in Shanghai.

The spearhead of Shanghai universities' opposition to waste is primarily focused on the two aspects that cost the most money: basic construction and the purchase and use of instruments and equipment. During the first Five-Year Plan, Shanghai universities built a total of 800,000 square meters of new school buildings and added instruments and equipment worth 23 million yuan. These constructions greatly improved the material conditions of the schools and ensured the needs of teaching. However, due to insufficient attention to and implementation of the policy of diligence and frugality in running schools, and the blind pursuit of so-called modernization standards, waste in these two areas has been very serious.

Except for Shanghai First and Second Medical Colleges and Jiaotong University, the land use quotas of other universities in Shanghai exceeded the regulations of the Ministry of Higher Education, and some schools even exceeded them by three or four times. East China Normal University found "five excesses" in land use: excessive rivers, excessive green areas, excessive sports fields, excessive building spacing, and excessive practice and experimental land. The dormitories for faculty and staff built by East China Institute of Chemical Technology, Shanghai Foreign Language Institute, and other schools all greatly exceeded the quality and unit price targets stipulated by the state. Tongji University spent 318,000 yuan to build an electrical engineering hall that was not necessary for a civil engineering and architectural university. Because there were few electrical engineering experiments, part of the building could only be used as a material warehouse and model storage room. A water tower built by East China Institute of Chemical Technology has not been used for five years. After Fudan University built the new biology and chemistry buildings in 1956, the liberal arts departments refused to use the houses vacated by the chemistry and biology departments and insisted on building a new 5,000-square-meter arts and history building, causing the state to prematurely invest more than 300,000 yuan last year.

According to the inspection by the Shanghai Higher Education Bureau, the classroom utilization rate of Shanghai universities is generally only around 40%. Classes are held in the morning, and most classrooms are empty in the afternoon. New classrooms are built when there are not enough, without actively improving classroom utilization through implementing a two-shift system and other measures.

Duplication of equipment and the phenomenon of equipment being prepared but unused are also common in various schools. The waste caused by the accumulation, over-purchase, repeated purchase, and wrong purchase of instruments and equipment at Jiaotong University since liberation amounted to more than 1 million yuan. The Department of Mechanical Manufacturing of this school spent a huge sum of 200,000 yuan to purchase a milling machine from abroad, but because it was not suitable for teaching, it could only be used for visits. The hydraulic and heating and ventilation laboratories of Tongji University purchased a large amount of steel when steel supply was most strained, and more than ten tons are still stockpiled.

While mobilizing the masses to expose waste, Shanghai universities have immediately started to plug loopholes. Several schools, such as East China University of Political Science and Law and East China Normal University, have returned or will soon return nearly 200 mu of land to agricultural cooperatives or the state. Shanghai First Medical College used the open space between buildings to plant medicinal plants, saving land for medicinal gardens and experiments. East China Institute of Chemical Technology also signed a contract with nearby farms to cultivate open space on campus. In addition to preparing to return dozens of mu of land to farmers, Fudan University is also preparing to combine greening with planting trees needed for teaching in the school's biology department, canceling the original plan to requisition 200 mu of land as a botanical garden. In the anti-waste movement, Fudan University re-examined this year's budget expenditure plan and decided to cut this year's budget expenditure by 10%, saving more than 400,000 yuan. The auxiliary machinery laboratory newly built by the Department of Marine Power of Jiaotong University, except for one newly purchased machine, all the equipment was made by teachers and workers themselves, using waste and old machines to repair and install them successfully, which saved the state 30,000 yuan. In order to improve the utilization rate of instruments and equipment and avoid repeated purchases, Shanghai First Medical College also compiled a distribution table of more expensive instruments for each teaching and research group to understand and allocate for use.

This newspaper reports: Tongji University is conducting a general inspection of basic construction, books, and teaching equipment. Judging from the initial revelations, the school's extravagance and waste are serious, and the ideas of pursuing large, numerous, new, and complete are quite common.

During the requisition of farmland in 1953 and 1954, due to being ambitious and greedy, and fearing that nearby farmland would be allocated to other units, "affecting future development," a lot of land was requisitioned. Even though a portion was returned last year, the occupied area still exceeds the regulations of the Ministry of Higher Education. In terms of building layout, the spacing also exceeds the regulations by two to three times, and the distance between the north and south classroom buildings reaches 160 meters. When the physical education teaching and research group learned that part of the land had been decided to be returned to the farmers, they hurriedly hired temporary workers, bought cinder and yellow sand, and started construction of the runway under the pretext of "need." In fact, this teaching and research group already has a 400-meter standard runway and a 350-meter runway, 29 basketball courts, and other sports fields wider than the Hongkou Stadium, which are sufficient for teaching and labor-defense system exercises.

The school's waste of houses is also very alarming. In terms of classrooms alone, there are four sets: special classrooms, design classrooms, self-study classrooms, and tiered classrooms. All classrooms can accommodate 10,000 people at the same time, of which the tiered classrooms can accommodate 4,500 people at the same time, while the school currently has only more than 4,000 students. The waste of offices is also the same. Some teachers have offices in the teaching and research group and offices in the laboratory. If they also hold administrative positions, then they have another set of offices. This not only wastes houses, but also occupies a large number of furniture.

In terms of purchasing teaching instruments and equipment, in the past, as long as it was related to teaching in some way, a large amount of money would be spent to buy them, resulting in a large amount of accumulation and waste.

The school is continuing to widely mobilize the masses to deeply expose and study specific measures to stop this waste.

### 不该盲目追求“现代化标准”  上海高等学校力堵浪费漏洞

    不该盲目追求“现代化标准”
    上海高等学校力堵浪费漏洞
    新华社上海14日电　一个群众性的揭发浪费堵塞漏洞的高潮，已在上海十八所高等学校中开始形成。
    上海高等学校反对浪费的矛头，首先集中在花钱最多的基本建设和仪器设备的购置使用两个方面。上海各高等学校在第一个五年计划期间共修建了八十万平方公尺的新校舍，添置了价值二千三百万元的仪器设备。这些建设大大改善了学校的物质条件，保证了教学的需要。但是，由于对勤俭办学的方针重视和贯彻得不够，盲目追求所谓现代化标准，这两方面的浪费也就十分严重。
    除上海第一、第二医学院、交通大学外，上海其他高等学校土地使用定额都超过了高等教育部的规定，有些学校甚至超过了三、四倍。华东师范大学检查出土地使用方面有“五大”，即河流大、绿化地带大、运动场地大、房屋间距大、实习试验用地大。华东化工学院、上海外国语学院等校修建的教职员工宿舍都大大超过了国家规定的质量和单价指标。同济大学用三十一万八千元修建了对土木建筑工业大学并非必要的一座电工馆，因为电工试验少，一部分房屋只有作为材料仓库和模型储藏室用。华东化工学院建造的一座自来水塔，五年来一直没有使用。复旦大学1956年新建生物楼和化学楼以后，文科各系拒绝使用化学和生物二系腾出来的房屋，坚持也要新建一座五千平方公尺的文史楼，致使国家在去年过早地投资了三十多万元。
    据上海市高等教育管理局检查，上海各高等学校的教室利用率一般只在40％左右，上午上课，下午大多空着。教室不够用就修新的，而没有从实行两部制等方面积极提高教室利用率。
    各校设备重复、备而无用的现象也不少。交通大学解放以来仪器设备积压、多购、重购、错购而造成的浪费，就达一百多万元。这个学校机械制造系用二十万元巨款从国外购来一架铣床，因不适合教学用，只能供参观。同济大学水力和暖气通风两个实验室在钢材供应最紧张的时候购进大批钢材，至今还积压了十多吨。
    上海各高等学校在发动群众揭发浪费现象的同时，已立即着手堵塞漏洞。华东政法学院、华东师范大学等几个学校已经退给或即将退给农业社或国家的土地即有近二百亩。上海第一医学院利用房屋间的空地种植药用植物，节省了药圃实验用地。华东化工学院也和附近农场订立合同，耕种校园中的空地。复旦大学除准备抽出几十亩土地还给农民外，还准备结合绿化，种植学校生物系教学所需的树木，取消了原来准备征购二百亩土地作植物园的计划。复旦大学在反浪费运动中重新审查了今年的经费开支计划，决定削减今年预算支出10％，节约四十多万元的开支。交通大学船舶动力系新建的辅机试验室，除一台新买的机器外，全部设备都是由教师、工人亲自动手，利用废旧机器修配安装成功的，这样就为国家节约了三万元。为了提高仪器设备利用率，避免重购，上海第一医学院还编制了较贵重的仪器的分布情况表，以便各教研组了解调拨使用。
    本报讯　同济大学正在对基本建设、图书、教学设备进行总检查。就初步揭露情况看，该校铺张浪费现象严重，求大、求多、求新、求全的思想相当普遍。
    该校在1953、1954年征购农地时，由于好大贪多，害怕附近农地被别的单位划去，“影响将来发展”，多征了不少土地，即使已在去年陆续退还了一部分，占地面积仍然超过高教部的规定。在房屋布局方面，间距也多超过规定二至三倍，南、北教室大楼间的距离达到一百六十公尺。体育教研组在知道部分土地决定退还给农民时，竟借口“需要”，赶紧雇临时工，买煤渣、黄沙，动工兴建跑道。事实上，这个教研组已拥有比虹口体育场还宽的四百公尺标准跑道和三百五十公尺跑道、二十九个篮球场以及其他体育场地，足够教学与劳卫制锻炼的需要。
    该校浪费房屋的现象也十分惊人。单就教室来说，就有专用教室、设计教室、自修教室和梯级教室等四套。全部教室可以同时容纳一万人，其中梯级教室可同时容纳四千五百人，而该校现有学生却只有四千多人。办公室的浪费也是这样。有些教师在教研组有办公室，在实验室又有办公室，如果又兼任行政职务，那末另外又有一套办公室。这不但浪费了房屋，而且还占用了大批家具。
    在购置教学仪器设备方面，过去只要和教学沾上一些边，就不惜花大批的钱去买，造成了大量的积压、浪费。
    该校正在继续广泛发动群众，深入揭发，并研究采取具体措施，制止这种浪费现象。
