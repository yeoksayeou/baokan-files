Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Calls from various countries' public opinion and political figures for holding East-West talks continue to rise. Many countries' leaders, around the New Year, have expressed their desire to ease international tensions through negotiations, leading to lasting peace.

According to the U.S. "New York Herald Tribune," George Gallup, director of the American Institute of Public Opinion, said that his institute's survey results showed: "Regardless of America's current policy, world opinion warmly supports the personal meeting of leaders Eisenhower and Khrushchev."

According to Gallup, his institute has conducted polls in many countries "from Helsinki to Johannesburg" and "from Washington to Delhi." The majority of residents in these major world cities support the Eisenhower-Khrushchev meeting; the number of people supporting this meeting accounts for 51% to 81% of those surveyed.

The question was posed as follows: "Do you hope that a meeting will be held between Khrushchev and Eisenhower?" In the poll results in Bonn, 81% gave an affirmative answer to this question, Athens was 71%, Helsinki was 69%, Delhi was 69%, Paris was 64%, Copenhagen was 61%, Toronto was 59%, Stockholm was 58%, Vienna was 55%, Washington and Chicago were both 54%, Johannesburg was 53%, and London was 51%.

Finnish President Urho Kekkonen, in his New Year's speech on Finnish Radio on New Year's Eve, said that stopping the arms race, reducing armaments, and abandoning unfounded prejudices are goals that everyone should strive to achieve.

He said that some people believe that only through the arms race can peace be guaranteed. But the arms race has never led to peace, only to war.

Danish Prime Minister H. C. Hansen advocated resuming disarmament negotiations, saying that small Western countries must loudly call for peace. And major powers should take the lead in taking action on international issues.

Hansen made these remarks in his New Year's radio address.

Prior to this, Hansen said in an interview with a Yugoslav magazine: The disarmament issue is the fundamental problem in the international arena today. He hoped to use every possible means to solve the current pressing problems.

The "Japan Times" published an interview on January 1st with Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama by the newspaper's reporter. In the interview, Fujiyama advocated that the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union should personally hold talks to adjust relations between East and West.

The chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, Erich Ollenhauer, issued a New Year's message on January 1st, demanding that the West German government reconsider its foreign policy. He said: The West German government "can and must reject the plan for West German atomic armament." He said: Atomic armament is against the wishes of the majority of people in West Germany.

West German Chancellor Adenauer also issued a New Year's message. In view of the pressure of public opinion, Adenauer had to express his willingness to negotiate with the Soviet Union, but at the same time he emphasized the need to consider the so-called "unity" of the West, advocating that West Germany should be "loyal to its treaty obligations with Western countries."

    要求东西方谈判呼声日高
    世界舆论热烈希望美苏领导人会谈
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国舆论和政界人士要求举行东西方会谈的呼声继续高涨。许多国家的领导人在新年前后都表示了希望通过谈判缓和国际紧张局势，导致持久和平的意愿。
    美国“纽约先驱论坛报”消息，美国民意测验所所长盖洛普说，他的测验所的调查结果表明：“不管美国现在的政策如何，世界舆论是热烈拥护艾森豪威尔和赫鲁晓夫这两位领袖亲自举行会谈的。”
    据盖洛普说，他的民意测验所已经在“从赫尔辛基到约翰内斯堡”，以及“从华盛顿到德里”的许多国家中进行了民意测验。这些世界大城市的大多数居民都拥护艾森豪威尔和赫鲁晓夫会谈；拥护这个会谈的人数占被询问者的51％到81％。
    问题是这样提的：“您是否希望赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔之间举行会谈？”在波恩的测验结果，有81％对这个问题作了肯定的答复，雅典是71％，赫尔辛基是69％，德里是69％，巴黎是64％，哥本哈根是61％，多伦多是59％，斯德哥尔摩是58％，维也纳是55％，华盛顿和芝加哥都是54％，约翰内斯堡是53％，伦敦是51％。
    芬兰共和国总统吉科宁除夕在芬兰广播电台发表的新年演说中说，停止军备竞赛、裁减军备和放弃没有根据的偏见是大家应该努力达到的目标。
    他说，某些人认为只有通过军备竞赛，才能保障和平。但是军备竞赛从来就只能导致战争，而不能导致和平。
    丹麦首相汉森主张恢复裁军谈判，他说，西方小国必须高声呼吁和平。而大国在国际问题上首当其冲，它们应该带头采取行动。
    汉森是在新年广播演说中说这番话的。
    在这以前，汉森在向南斯拉夫的一家杂志发表谈话中说：裁军问题是今天国际上的根本问题。他希望用一切可能的办法来解决目前急需解决的问题。
    “日本时报”1日登载了日本外务相藤山爱一郎向这家报纸的记者发表的谈话。藤山爱一郎在谈话中主张美国和苏联两国的领导人亲自举行会谈，以便调整东西方之间的关系。
    西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔1日发表新年文告，要求西德政府重新考虑它的外交政策。他说：西德政府“能够而且必须拒绝关于西德原子军备的计划”。他说：原子军备是违反西德大多数人的愿望的。
    西德总理阿登纳也发表了新年文告。鉴于舆论的压力，阿登纳不得不表示愿意同苏联进行谈判，但是他同时又强调要考虑所谓西方的“团结一致”，鼓吹西德要“忠于它同西方国家所缔结的条约的义务”。
