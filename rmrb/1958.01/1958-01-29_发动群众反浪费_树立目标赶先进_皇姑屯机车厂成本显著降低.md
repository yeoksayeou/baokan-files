    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 28th (Special Dispatch) The HuangguTun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Shenyang City, during the rectification campaign, mobilized its workers in a planned and systematic way to oppose waste, which greatly reduced the cost of locomotive and rolling stock overhaul. The cost of passenger car overhaul in December last year was 33.7% lower than planned, and the cost of locomotive overhaul in December was 31.22% lower than planned; the cost of frequently overhauled same-type passenger cars has already caught up with the advanced national level of the second quarter of last year – the level of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory.
    The main factor in the rapid decline in costs is the significant reduction in raw material costs. This factory failed to complete its cost plan in the first quarter of last year. At the first Workers' Representative Conference held in May, representatives suggested that factory leaders take measures to eliminate waste and reduce costs. However, at that time, the leaders were not clear about the extent of the waste, and the cost in the second quarter had already been reduced compared with the plan, so no effective measures were taken for a long time. In August, after the factory started the rectification campaign, the leaders conducted in-depth inspections of all aspects of production, and compared the situation of their own factory with advanced factories. The results showed that the cost of overhauling the same type of passenger car in the second quarter was 36.7% higher than that of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory; the cost of overhauling the same type of locomotive was 30.9% higher than that of the Mudanjiang Locomotive Repair Factory. The main reason for the high cost was that more old parts were scrapped during the overhaul process, and raw materials were seriously wasted. The cost of raw materials for overhauling the same type of passenger car in this factory was 70% higher than that of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory.
    During this period, workers also posted many big-character posters during the extensive airing of views, questioning and criticizing the factory's high costs. In order to rely on the masses to eliminate waste and reduce costs, the factory leaders first formulated a cost reduction plan. This plan focused on eliminating waste of raw materials and decided to take more than 190 specific measures to make the locomotive cost reach the advanced level of the Mudanjiang Locomotive Repair Factory, and the passenger car cost reach the advanced level of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and mobilize all the workers of the factory to launch a special campaign of airing views to oppose waste and reduce costs. In the special campaign of airing views, all the workers of the factory put forward more than 1,200 criticisms and suggestions in one week, and 546 specific measures were sorted out. The enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses were organized into practical actions to oppose waste and reduce costs.
    Workers not only resisted waste, but also used their brains to find ways to save. Many workers sacrificed their personal interests to protect the interests of the country from loss. A spirit of diligence and thrift in running enterprises has been formed throughout the factory.
    After achieving victory in the struggle to save raw materials, the focus of the factory's anti-waste struggle is now directed at other factors in the cost structure, further overcoming waste and comprehensively reducing costs from aspects such as wage expenditure, equipment depreciation, and management expenses. The new direction of struggle pointed out by the factory leaders to the workers is: the overhaul time quota for passenger cars should catch up with the national advanced level of the Puzhen Passenger Car Repair Factory; the overhaul time quota for locomotives should catch up with the national advanced level of the Zhuzhou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory; the labor productivity of locomotive and passenger car overhaul should be increased by 16%, and the wage expenditure should be relatively reduced.

### 发动群众反浪费  树立目标赶先进  皇姑屯机车厂成本显著降低

    发动群众反浪费  树立目标赶先进
    皇姑屯机车厂成本显著降低
    本报特约新华社沈阳28日电　沈阳市皇姑屯机车客车修理工厂在整风当中，有准备有步骤地发动职工反对浪费，使机车车辆检修成本大大降低。客车检修成本在去年12月份比计划降低33.7％，机车检修成本12月份比计划降低31.22％；经常大量检修的同类型的客车成本，已经赶过去年第二季度全国先进水平——哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂的水平。
    成本迅速下降的主要因素，是原材料费的突出降低。这个工厂在去年第一季度就没有完成成本计划。在5月间召开的第一届职工代表大会上，代表们就建议工厂领导上采取措施杜绝浪费，降低成本。但是当时由于领导上对浪费心中无数，加上第二季度成本已比计划降低，所以迟迟没有采取有效措施。8月间，工厂开始整风以后，领导上深入检查了生产各环节，并把自己工厂的情况同先进工厂对比研究，结果发现第二季度检修同类型客车，成本比哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂高36.7％；检修同类型机车，成本比牡丹江机车修理工厂高30.9％。成本高的主要原因，是由于检修过程中旧部件报废多，原材料浪费严重。同样检修一辆同类型客车，这个工厂的原材料费竟比哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂高70％。
    在这期间，职工们在大鸣大放中也就工厂成本高的问题贴出许多大字报，提出质问和批评。为了依靠群众杜绝浪费降低成本，工厂领导上首先制订了降低成本方案。这个方案以杜绝原材料浪费为主要内容，决定采取一百九十多项具体措施，使机车成本赶上牡丹江机车修理工厂先进水平，客车成本赶上哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂先进水平，发动全厂职工展开反浪费、降低成本的专题鸣放。全厂职工在专题鸣放中，一个星期内就提出了一千二百多件批评和建议，整理出来的具体措施就有五百四十六项。群众的积极性和智慧，被组织成反浪费、降低成本的实际行动。
    工人们不仅抵制浪费现象，并且动脑筋想办法节约。很多工人都牺牲个人利益，来维护国家利益不受损失。勤俭办企业的风气，已经在全厂范围形成。
    在节约原材料的斗争取得胜利后，目前这个工厂反浪费斗争的矛头，又在指向成本构成的其他因素，从工资开支、设备折旧、管理费用等方面，进一步克服浪费，全面降低成本。工厂领导上给职工指出的新的斗争方向是：客车检修工时定额，要赶上浦镇客车修理工厂的全国先进水平；机车检修工时定额，要赶上株洲机车车辆修理工厂的全国先进水平；机车客车检修劳动生产率要提高16％，并相对地降低工资开支。
