Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 10th—TASS reported that Saudi Arabian Crown Prince and Prime Minister Faisal, who is currently visiting Cairo, stated to an American International News Service reporter in Cairo that Saudi Arabia has not changed its negative attitude towards the "Eisenhower Doctrine." He said, "We believed from the beginning that this doctrine, which treats the Middle East as a vacuum, is completely unnecessary."

Faisal emphasized that the Arab people desire unity, and there are no irreconcilable differences among Arab leaders that would hinder the realization of this unity.

The Saudi Arabian Prime Minister pointed out that the Arab people do not believe in the so-called "communist threat" with which Western countries frighten the Arabs. He said that the real threat to peace in the Middle East is foreign interference in the internal affairs of the countries in this region.

    沙特阿拉伯首相对美国记者发表谈话
    重申反对艾森豪威尔主义
    新华社11日讯　塔斯社开罗10日讯：正在开罗访问的沙特阿拉伯王储、首相费萨尔向美国国际新闻社驻开罗记者发表谈话说，沙特阿拉伯并没有改变它对“艾森豪威尔主义”的否定态度。他说：“我们在最初就认为这个把中东当作真空地区的主义没有任何必要”。
    费萨尔强调指出，阿拉伯人民希望团结一致，在阿拉伯国家领导人之间不存在会妨碍实现这种团结一致的不可调和的分歧。
    沙特阿拉伯首相指出，阿拉伯人不相信西方国家借以恫吓阿拉伯人的所谓“共产主义威胁”。他说，中东和平的真正威胁是外国对这个地区国家内政的干涉。
