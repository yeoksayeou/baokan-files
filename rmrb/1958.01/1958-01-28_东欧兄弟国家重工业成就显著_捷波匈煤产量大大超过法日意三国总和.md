    Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: In 1957, the heavy industry sectors of European socialist countries achieved significant successes.

    In the coal mining industry, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary collectively produced over 190 million tons of coal last year, approximately 90 million tons more than the total coal production of France, Japan, and Italy combined in 1956. Before the war, in 1937, the total coal production of France, Japan, and Italy exceeded the coal production of these three countries by about 11 million tons. Czechoslovakia's coal production last year increased by more than 5 million tons compared to the previous year. Hungarian coal miners mined more coal last year than in 1956. Romania produced as much coal in less than five months last year as it did in the entire year of 1948.

    In the steel industry, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia collectively produced approximately 11.5 million tons of steel last year, an increase of over 800,000 tons compared to the previous year, and an increase of approximately 7.5 million tons compared to 1937. Calculated per capita, Czechoslovakia's steel production has risen from tenth place in the world in 1937 to seventh place last year. Poland produced 5.3 million tons of steel last year, compared to just over 1 million tons in 1937. Yugoslavia's steel production last year reached its highest level in history, exceeding 1 million tons.

    In the oil and non-ferrous metal mining industries, Romania's oil production increased from 3.9 million tons in 1947 to 11 million tons last year, ranking second in Europe and eleventh in the world. Bulgaria mined approximately twice as much non-ferrous metal ore last year as the total amount mined in the sixty-six years before liberation, with the mining volume of various ores increasing to more than fifty times that of 1939. Albania mined approximately twenty-three times more chromium ore last year than in 1938 before liberation.

    In electricity production, Czechoslovakia produced more than three times as much electricity last year as in 1937, reaching over 17 billion kilowatt-hours, ranking eleventh in Europe. Bulgaria produced over 2.6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity last year, more than 2.3 billion kilowatt-hours more than in 1937. Bulgaria has already ranked first among the Balkan countries in terms of per capita electricity production. Romania could produce the equivalent of its entire 1938 electricity production in just seventy-six days last year. Poland's newly added power station equipment capacity alone was approximately 760,000 kilowatts last year.

    In machine manufacturing, Czechoslovakia's heavy machinery manufacturing industry produced 19.4% more equipment for metallurgical plants last year than the previous year, 53.4% more equipment for cement plants, and more than doubled the production of road rollers. Calculated per capita, it is now approaching the American level in the production of metal-cutting lathes and has caught up with the American level in the production of rolling mill equipment. Poland's machine manufacturing industry has developed into one of the country's main industrial sectors, and its tractors are already being exported to countries in the Middle East, Near East, and Southeast Asia. In the past eight years up to last year, Poland has built a total of 350 ships of various types.

    东欧兄弟国家重工业成就显著
    捷波匈煤产量大大超过法日意三国总和
    据新华社27日讯　1957年欧洲社会主义国家的重工业部门的生产获得了显著的成就。
    在采煤工业方面，去年捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和匈牙利总共生产了一亿九千多万吨煤，比1956年法国、日本和意大利三国煤产量的总和约多九千多万吨。而在战前1937年，法、日、意三国的煤产量总和却比这三个国家的煤产量总和多一千一百万吨左右。去年捷克斯洛伐克的采煤量比前年多五百多万吨。匈牙利的煤矿工人去年开采的煤超过了1956年的水平。罗马尼亚去年不到五个月生产的煤就相当于1948年全年的产量。
    在钢铁工业方面，去年捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和南斯拉夫总共生产了约一千一百五十万吨钢，即比前年增加了八十多万吨，比1937年约增加了七百五十万吨。按人口平均计算，去年捷克斯洛伐克的钢产量已经从1937年的占世界第十位跃居为第七位。波兰去年生产的钢达到了五百三十万吨，而1937年只有一百多万吨。南斯拉夫去年的钢产量达到了历史上的最高水平，超过了一百万吨。
    在石油和有色金属采矿业方面，去年罗马尼亚的石油产量从1947年的三百九十万吨增加到一千一百万吨，居欧洲第二位和世界第十一位。保加利亚去年开采的有色金属矿砂比解放前六十六年的开采量总和约多一倍，各种矿砂的开采量都增加到1939年的五十倍以上。去年阿尔巴尼亚开采的铬矿砂比解放前1938年多二十三倍左右。
    在电力生产方面，捷克斯洛伐克去年生产的电力比1937年多三倍多，达到了一百七十多亿度，居欧洲第十一位。保加利亚去年生产了二十六亿多度电力，比1937年多二十三亿多度。按人口平均生产的电力，保加利亚已经居于巴尔干国家的首位。罗马尼亚去年每七十六天就可以生产出相当于1938年全年的电力。波兰在去年单是新增加的发电站设备能力就约有七十六万瓩。
    在机器制造业生产方面，去年捷克斯洛伐克重型机器制造业为冶金工厂生产的设备比前年增加了19.4％，为水泥工厂生产的设备增加了53.4％，压路机的产量增加了一倍多。按人口平均计算，目前它在金属切削车床生产方面已经接近美国水平，在轧钢设备生产方面已经赶上美国水平。波兰机器制造业已经发展成为国内主要工业部门之一，它所生产的拖拉机已经远销到中近东和东南亚国家。在到去年为止的过去八年中，波兰制成的各种船只共达三百五十艘。
