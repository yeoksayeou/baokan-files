    Tapping Potential to Ensure Good Teaching
    New Atmosphere Emerges in the Process of Sending Cadres Down to Lower Levels at Sichuan Agricultural College
    (Our Dispatch) Sichuan Agricultural College has seen a new atmosphere emerge in the process of sending cadres down to lower levels.
    The comrades who have been approved to go down are not only busy packing, actively preparing to depart, and expressing gratitude to the Party for its care and trust, but are also persisting in their current work until the very last minute. The teachers who remain at the school have not been affected by their work emotions because they were not approved to go down. On the contrary, they all realize that "staying at school is also obeying the needs of the Party." Everyone is channeling their enthusiasm and determination for going up to the mountains and down to the countryside into their current and future work, bravely and cheerfully taking on the work left by the comrades who are going down to the countryside.
    The comrades from the Agronomy Department who were approved to go down have mostly set a good example for everyone before their departure. Chen Jinyu (teaching assistant) of the Plant Protection Group was originally scheduled to depart in the first batch. She demonstrated a high degree of initiative, completing her work tasks for the current term three weeks ahead of schedule. She also prepared the experimental preparation work for weeks sixteen to eighteen within three days after being approved. Moreover, she was not satisfied with this and also prepared forest disease slides for student tutoring before the exam. Zhang Rensui of the Soil and Agricultural Chemistry Group, after receiving the news of his approval to go down to the countryside, also used his spare time to organize all the content of the current soil practice. Fu Danru of the Crop Cultivation Group, in addition to correcting the report of her own internship, also strove to correct the internship report for Fan Shumin (on maternity leave).
    The comrades who remained at the school all expressed that they would muster revolutionary energy and actively and proactively strive to do more work. For example, Professor Xiong Tingzhu of the Crop Group said: "Although I have not led internships in the past, I can take on internships in the next term when there are fewer people." Peng Jiayuan said: "In the future, with fewer people, our scientific research and teaching work will not only not be affected, but the quality should be guaranteed even more." Each teaching and research group has made proper arrangements for the work left by the comrades who are going down to the countryside this term. Everyone bravely took on the work of the comrades going down to the countryside. For example, the number of teachers in the Chemistry Group who are responsible for internships this term has been reduced from five to two, but the work is still proceeding as usual. Associate Professor Wang Zuze used to only teach a small class (fifteen students) for internships and did not correct reports. Now he voluntarily undertakes two large classes (thirty students per class) and corrects all internship reports. Other teachers in various teaching and research groups have similar situations. They have not only made arrangements for the work of this term, but are also carefully considering the long-term work in the future. Through rectification and sending cadres down to lower levels, they have all decided to adopt a method of mutual support to solve teaching problems in the future. For example, the Plant Protection Group plans to take measures to support forest entomology with forest pathology, and to support forest pathology with agricultural pathology. At the same time, they are also considering supporting the microbiology course of the Soil Group. Now the teachers who remain at the school generally say in unison: In order to run a socialist university well, so that the comrades who go down to the countryside can engage in agricultural production with peace of mind and better train and transform themselves in labor, we must work as hard as two people in the future!

### 发挥潜力保证做好教学工作  四川农学院下放干部过程中出现新气象

    发挥潜力保证做好教学工作
    四川农学院下放干部过程中出现新气象
    本报讯　四川农学院在下放干部过程中，出现了一片新气象。
    被批准下放的同志们，除了忙着收拾行装，积极准备出发，感谢党对自己的关怀和信任外，同时大家都把目前的工作，坚持到最后一分钟。留校的老师们也并没有因未被批准而影响自己工作情绪，相反的都认识到“留在学校，这也是服从党的需要，”大家都把上山下乡的热情和决心贯穿到目前和今后的工作中去，把下乡同志留下的工作，勇敢的愉快的担当下来。
    农学系被批准下放的同志们，大多在未出发前就给大家树立了良好的榜样。植保组陈金玉（教辅员）本来是第一批出发的，她发挥了高度的积极性，提前三周完成了本期的工作任务，并把十六—十八周的实验准备工作，在批准后的三天内准备就绪了，而且，她没有因此而满足，还把考试前同学辅导用的森林病害片子也准备好了。土壤农化组张仁绥在得到批准下乡的消息后，还利用休息时间，把本期土壤实习全部内容整理就绪。作物栽培组傅淡如，除改好自己担任实习的报告外，还争取为樊淑敏（产假）改实习报告。
    留校的同志们都表示要鼓足革命干劲积极主动地争取多做工作，如作物组熊廷柱教授说：“过去虽然自己没有带过实习，下期人少了，我可以担任实习”。彭家元说：“今后人少了，我们的科研、教学工作不但不能受到影响，而且更应当保证质量”。各教研组对本期下乡同志留下来的工作，都作了妥善的安排。对下乡同志的工作，大家都勇敢地承担了下来。如化学组本期担任实习的先生由五人减到二人，但工作照样进行。王祖泽副教授过去除讲课外，只带一个小班（十五人）的实习，不改报告，现在自己志愿担任两个大班（每班三十人），并批改所有实习报告。其他各教研组的教师都有类似的情况。他们不仅对本期工作作了安排，就是今后长期的工作也在慎重地加以考虑。通过整改和下放干部，他们都决定在今后采取彼此互相支援的方式来解决教学问题。如植保组计划采取森林病理支援森林昆虫，农业病理支援森林病理的办法外，同时还考虑到去支援土壤组的微生物课程。现在留校的教师们一般都是异口同声的说：为了办好社会主义大学，使下乡的同志安心农业生产，更好地在劳动中锻炼改造自己，我们今后一个人硬要作两个人的工作才行啊！
