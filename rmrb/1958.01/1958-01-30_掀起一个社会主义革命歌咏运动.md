    Launch a Socialist Revolution Song Movement
    By a commentator of this newspaper

    Thoroughly eliminating yellow songs is a serious struggle currently underway on the music front. On this front, to ensure that the people's music art triumphs over the bourgeoisie's music art, we need to carry out a series of tasks. For example, reactionary songs that promote fascism, such as "Love Horse March," "China Song," and "Manchurian Girl," should be banned; and yellow songs that promote the bourgeoisie's decadent lifestyle, such as "When Will You Return," "Everywhere Kisses," and "Selling Yearning," should be condemned by public opinion. But besides these, there is another important task, which is to require our composers, lyricists, and performers to create and perform more good musical works to meet the needs of the masses' musical lives and to raise the masses' noble and healthy musical appreciation interests. If this work is not done well, that is, if the broad masses still lack short, popular, and well-loved songs that reflect the current reality of struggle, then not only will it be difficult to completely eliminate yellow songs, but also the phenomenon of the masses "having no songs to sing" in the future will not be avoided. Of course, other work is also needed to coordinate, such as the promotion and popularization of good songs.
    The prevalence of yellow songs is by no means accidental. It has a variety of causes, such as the attacks of bourgeois rightists, and the far-reaching influence of bourgeois ideology and lifestyles. But aside from these reasons, it is also closely related to the current lack of a large number of good mass songs.
    It should first be seen that in recent years, our musicians have written many excellent songs for the broad masses. In terms of quantity, there are more than 20 kinds of music publications nationwide, with hundreds of new mass songs published every month; in terms of quality, among these songs, there are also good songs that are widely popular, such as "I Want to Be a Good Commune Member," "Guests from Afar, Please Stay," "Truly Happy to Death," and "Daughter's Song." But despite this, it is still far from meeting the masses' multifaceted and growing needs for musical life. Workers said: "The loudspeaker keeps playing 'In that distant place, there is a good girl…' No matter how good the girl is, we are tired of listening to it." At some rural commune members' meetings, commune members could not find new songs to sing, so they had to collectively sing "Little Son-in-Law." With the great leap forward in rural production, the farmers' demands for cultural life have grown rapidly, and they urgently need songs that reflect their socialist ideological feelings and encourage their production enthusiasm, but they cannot find many works that they like.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, there was a large-scale national salvation singing movement. In the era of socialist revolution, shouldn't we launch a socialist revolution singing movement? The socialist era needs socialist songs, and our musicians should first and foremost unhesitatingly meet this demand of the masses.
    Perhaps some people will ask, mass songs have not been created less in recent years, but why are there still not many songs that are easy to sing and sound good? There are naturally many reasons, but the main reason is that music workers do not pay enough attention to the popularization of music, and that many people have been detached from mass life and struggle for a long time. As a result, mass songs are not rich enough, or the songs produced by them lack a strong atmosphere of life and a surge of revolutionary passion, as the masses say: "Dry, stiff, and tasteless to sing."
    At the same time, there are still some people who believe that mass songs are "low-level" and "not of high artistic value," so they are unwilling to engage in this "low-level" work, but are obsessed with writing large-scale so-called "international-level" works. Some people even openly declare that he deliberately does not write works for the masses of today to understand, because he is creating for the masses of fifty years later. These views are obviously wrong. Of course, writing large-scale works, such as choral works and symphonies, cannot be said to be a bad phenomenon, but the problem is: first, we cannot despise writing small things because we write big things. That is to say, our creations should not at any time be separated from the most urgent needs of the masses and the current level of appreciation of the masses; second, mass songs must not be regarded as "low-level" and "not of high artistic value." Many anti-Japanese songs that are still popular today are endlessly sung and never tire of listening to, which precisely illustrates their achievements in terms of ideology and artistry; third, the so-called "creating for the masses of fifty years later" is obviously wrong. May I ask, without the present, how can we talk about the future? Works that are not understood by today's masses, how can we talk about being understood by the masses in the future? Whether it is Nie Er's "March of the Volunteers" or Xian Xinghai's "Yellow River Cantata," it is precisely because it was understood and loved by thousands of anti-Japanese masses at that time that it can be understood and loved by today's masses.
    The masses generally feel that there are no songs to sing, which is also inseparable from the fact that some of our music workers despise the popularization of mass singing. Especially after entering the city, some performing groups and professional music workers are unwilling to give demonstration performances to the masses, unwilling to provide guidance to the masses, and are only obsessed with improving themselves behind closed doors. As a result, even if there are good songs, it is difficult to promote and spread them. Recently, some performing arts groups in Beijing have begun to go to rural factories and mines to perform in a planned way, strengthening the singing guidance work for the masses; some radio stations have also planned to recommend and teach the masses to sing excellent songs that reflect the current reality of struggle; some publishing houses have also begun to publish popular songbooks and dance music collections suitable for mass singing and playing. This is a gratifying phenomenon.
    Comrades Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, the pioneers of socialist music and the great singers of the people, have set a shining example in creating mass songs and in enlivening the mass singing movement. Just take Xian Xinghai as an example: During the Anti-Japanese War, he always cared about the fate of the motherland, using music as a fighting weapon to mobilize the masses to fight the enemy. On the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, he used songs to call out the demand to stop the civil war and unite against Japan, writing "Guns Outward, Step Forward in Unison" (National Salvation Army Song); as soon as the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, he shouted "Where did the enemy come from, send him back to where he came from" (Defend Lugou Bridge); after the Japanese invaders entered the mainland, he used "The Beginning of Victory" and "Defend Wuhan" to encourage the people's morale and strengthen the people's belief; when guerrilla warfare was generally launched behind enemy lines, he wrote passionate songs such as "Go to the Enemy's Rear" and "On Taihang Mountain"; after arriving in Yan'an, he wrote about 200 mass songs reflecting various aspects of struggle. He took these songs to the front, to the rear, to the cities, and to the countryside; wherever he went, he brought songs. He was closely united with the masses, the needs of the people were his needs, and the voices of the people were his voices. Although the reactionary yellow songs were rampant at that time, the revolutionary red songs were like a storm, becoming the mainstream of the era.
    Today, our era has given our musicians an extraordinarily rich and broad creative subject matter and provided extremely favorable creative conditions. Musicians should not hesitate to throw themselves into the mass struggle and create more and better, diverse, lively, and vivid songs for the masses.
    Let red songs defeat yellow songs!

    掀起一个社会主义革命歌咏运动
    本报评论员
    彻底肃清黄色歌曲，这是目前音乐战线上的一场严重的斗争。在这条战线上，要使人民的音乐艺术战胜资产阶级的音乐艺术，就要求我们进行一系列的工作。比如，对那些宣传法西斯主义的反动歌曲，像“爱马进行曲”、“支那之歌”、“满洲姑娘”等，就应当予以取缔；对于那些宣扬资产阶级腐朽生活方式的黄色歌曲，像“何日君再来”、“处处吻”、“卖相思”等，就应当造成社会舆论予以谴责。但是除此之外，还有一项重要的工作，就是要求我们的作曲家、词作家和演唱家多多创作、演出好的音乐作品，以满足群众音乐生活的需要，以提高群众高尚健康的音乐欣赏兴趣。如果这一工作做不好，就是说，广大群众仍是十分缺乏反映当前现实斗争生活的短小通俗和喜闻乐见的歌曲，那么不仅黄色歌曲不易彻底肃清，就是今后群众中的“没歌子唱”的现象也不会免除。当然，也还要有其他工作来配合，例如对好的歌曲的宣传和推广。
    黄色歌曲的泛滥决不是偶然的。它有着多种多样的原因，如资产阶级右派分子的进攻，资产阶级的思想和生活方式还有深远的影响等等。但是除开这些原因以外，它与目前缺乏大量好的群众歌曲也有很大关系。
    应当首先看到，近几年来，我们的音乐家为广大群众写了不少的优秀歌曲。从数量上看，全国有二十多种音乐刊物，每月有几百首新的群众歌曲问世；从质量上看，在这些歌曲中，也有流行较广的好歌子，如“我要做个好社员”、“远方的客人请你留下来”、“真正乐死人”、“闺女之歌”等。但是尽管这样，它还远远不能满足群众对音乐生活的多方面的和日益增长的需求。工人们说：“喇叭筒里过来过去老放‘在那遥远的地方，有个好姑娘……’，姑娘再好，也听厌了。”在一些农村社员大会上，社员们找不到新歌子唱，也只好集体合唱个“小女婿”。农村生产大跃进，农民对文化生活的要求迅速增长，他们迫切需要反映他们的社会主义思想感情、鼓舞他们的生产劲头的歌曲，可是找不到多少为他们所中意的作品。
    抗日战争时期有声势浩大的救亡歌咏运动，在社会主义革命的时代，难道不应当掀起一个社会主义革命歌咏运动来吗？社会主义时代需要社会主义之歌，我们的音乐家首先应当毫不犹豫地满足群众的这种要求。
    也许有人会问，群众歌曲近几年创作的并不算少，但为什么好唱好听的歌子仍然不多呢？原因自然很多，但是最主要的原因还在于音乐工作者对音乐的普及工作重视得不够，还在于不少人长期地脱离群众生活和斗争。因而群众歌曲不够丰富，或者在他们笔下所产生的歌子，缺少浓厚的生活气息，也缺少磅礴的革命激情，正如群众讲的：“干巴巴，硬蹦蹦，唱起来没味”。
    同时也还有一些人至今还认为，群众歌曲是“低级”的、“艺术价值不高”的东西，因而他们不愿从事这种“低级”的工作，而醉心于写大部头的所谓“国际水平”的东西。有的人甚至公开宣称，他写作品就是有意不为今天的群众所理解，因为他是为五十年以后的群众创作的。这些看法显然都是不对头的。固然写大部头的东西，如大合唱、交响乐，并不能说是坏现象，但问题在于：一，不能因为写大东西就瞧不起写小东西。就是说，我们的创作任何时候都不应当离开群众最迫切的需要和群众目前的欣赏水平；二，群众歌曲决不能被视为是“低级”的、“艺术价值不高”的东西，许多至今流行的抗日歌曲，所以被人们百唱不厌，百听不烦，不正是说明了它们在思想性与艺术性诸方面的成就吗？三，所谓“为五十年以后的群众创作”，更是显然错误的。试问，离开现在，哪能谈得上将来？不被今天群众所理解的作品，哪能谈得上为将来群众所理解呢？无论是聂耳的“义勇军进行曲”也好，还是冼星海的“黄河大合唱”也好，正由于它是为当时千千万万抗日群众所理解所喜爱，因之它也才能为今天的群众所理解所喜爱。
    群众普遍感到没歌子唱，也还和我们的一部分音乐工作者轻视群众歌咏普及工作分不开的。特别是进城之后，有些演唱团体和专业音乐工作者不愿向群众作示范演出，不愿向群众作辅导工作，只醉心于关门提高。这样一来，即使有好的歌子，也很难得到推广流传。最近，北京一些演唱艺术团体已开始有计划地深入农村工矿演出，加强对群众的歌咏辅导工作；一些广播电台也有计划地向群众推荐和教唱反映当前现实斗争生活的优秀歌曲；一些出版社也开始出版适于群众演唱和演奏的通俗歌本和舞曲选集。这是可喜的现象。
    社会主义音乐的开拓者、人民伟大的歌手聂耳、冼星海同志，在创作群众歌曲方面，在活跃群众歌咏运动方面，作出了光辉的榜样。单就冼星海来说：在抗战时期，他时时关心着祖国的命运，以音乐作为战斗武器，去动员群众和敌人斗争。抗战前夕，他用歌曲呼喊出了停止内战、一致抗日的要求，写下了“枪口对外，齐步向前”（救国军歌）；芦沟桥事变一开始，他便高喊“敌人从哪里来，把他打回哪里去”
  （保卫芦沟桥）；日寇侵入内地后，他便以“胜利的开始”、“保卫大武汉”来鼓舞人民的斗志，坚定人民的信念；当游击战争在敌后普遍开展起来的时候，他又写下了“到敌人后方去”、“在太行山上”等热情充沛的歌曲；到了延安之后，他又写了约二百首反映多方面斗争生活的群众歌曲。他把这些歌曲带到前方，带到后方，带到城市，带到乡村；他走到哪里，歌声带到哪里。他紧紧地和群众结合在一起，人民的需要为他的需要，人民的呼声为他的呼声。尽管当时反动的黄色歌曲异常猖獗，但革命的红色歌曲却像狂风暴雨，成为时代的主流。
    今天，我们的时代赋予我们音乐家以异常丰富广阔的创作题材，提供了极其优越的创作条件。音乐家们应当毫不踌躇地投入到群众斗争中去，为群众创作更多更好、多种多样、生动活泼的歌曲。
    让红色歌曲战胜黄色歌曲吧！
