Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 4th - Saudi Arabian Crown Prince, Prime Minister, and Foreign Minister Faisal stated in Cairo on January 2nd that Saudi Arabia is not interested in following the United States.

Faisal arrived in Egypt on January 1st for a week-long visit. On the evening of the 3rd, he had dinner and held talks with Egyptian President Nasser.

At a press conference held by Faisal on the 2nd, he was asked whether Saudi Arabia would change its attitude towards the Baghdad Pact given Dulles' attendance at the upcoming Baghdad Pact Council meeting. He said, "I am surprised by those who attempt to separate Saudi Arabia from its Arab neighbors. We are not interested in following the United States, and there is no reason to mention Saudi Arabia every time the United States is brought up." He emphasized, "Our policy towards the treaty has not changed."

Faisal also said that there are no major differences between Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria.

A reporter told Faisal that when he was in the United States, there were reports that he had expressed "concern" about Syria's policies. Faisal replied, "This is anti-Arab propaganda. What I did was to express to U.S. Secretary of State Dulles that we are concerned about the United States' policy towards the current government of Syria."

Faisal accused certain individuals in the United States of obstructing an agreement between Saudi Arabia and a Japanese company regarding the exploitation of oil in certain areas of Saudi Arabia. He said, however, that Saudi Arabian King Saud insisted on signing the agreement.

The agreement was signed in December of last year. According to the agreement, the profits from oil extraction will be distributed with Saudi Arabia receiving 56% and Japan receiving 44%. In contrast, the American ARAMCO company has consistently only paid Saudi Arabia 50% of the profits from oil extraction in Saudi Arabia.

Faisal emphasized that Saudi Arabia is not a satellite state of the United States. He also denied reports that Saudi Arabia had allowed the United States to store hydrogen bombs at the Dhahran Air Base.

    沙特阿拉伯首相访问开罗
    表示对追随美国并不感兴趣
    据新华社开罗4日电　沙特阿拉伯王储、首相兼外交大臣费萨尔2日在开罗说，沙特阿拉伯对追随美国并不感到兴趣。
    费萨尔在1月1日到达埃及作为时一周的访问。他在3日晚间同埃及总统纳赛尔共进晚餐并会谈。
    在费萨尔2日举行的记者招待会上，有人问他，在杜勒斯将出席即将举行的巴格达条约理事会的情况下，沙特阿拉伯是否会改变自己对这个条约的态度。他说：“我对那些企图把沙特阿拉伯同它的阿拉伯邻国分开的人们感到惊奇。我们对追随美国并不感到兴趣，没有理由每当提起美国的时候就提到沙特阿拉伯。”他强调说：“我们对条约的政策没有改变。”
    费萨尔还说，沙特阿拉伯同埃及和叙利亚之间没有重大分歧。
    有记者告诉费萨尔，当他在美国时，有消息说他曾经表示沙特阿拉伯对叙利亚的政策“表示关切”。费萨尔回答说：“这是反阿拉伯的宣传。我所曾经做过的是向美国国务卿杜勒斯表示，我们为美国对叙利亚现政府的政策担心。”
    费萨尔指责美国某些人士曾经阻挠沙特阿拉伯同一家日本公司签订关于开采沙特阿拉伯某些地区的石油的协定。他说，但是沙特阿拉伯国王沙特坚持签订这个协定。
    协定已经在去年12月间签订。根据这项协定，开采石油所得的利润将按照沙特阿拉伯得56％、日本得44％的比例分配。而美国的阿美石油公司一向只把在沙特阿拉伯开采石油所得利润的50％付给沙特阿拉伯。
    费萨尔强调说，沙特阿拉伯不是美国的卫星国。他还否认沙特阿拉伯已经允许美国在扎赫兰空军基地储存氢弹的消息。
