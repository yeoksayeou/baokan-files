Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th. Guangdong Province will basically eliminate the "four pests" and become a "four-without province" within the next eight years. This was decided at the Guangdong Provincial Patriotic Health Campaign Experience Exchange Conference held recently in Lechang County.

Guangdong Province's elimination of the "four pests" will be carried out in three stages: this year, developing, consolidating, and improving pilot projects; five years of concentrated effort and popularization; and the final two years of finishing touches.

The conference criticized right-leaning conservative thinking that lacked confidence in eliminating the "four pests." Many counties and cities have formulated preliminary plans to become basically "four-without" counties and cities within five or six years. Longchuan County has cultivated more than thirty working points for eliminating the "four pests" and has formulated a plan to become a basic "four-without county" within five years. Guangzhou City, building on its achievements in health work, has also preliminarily planned to become a basic "four-without" city within six years.

To ensure the gradual realization of this plan, the conference decided that this year, we must first do a good job in excrement management and fertilizer accumulation, and vigorously carry out the improvement of toilets and manure pits. Both urban and rural areas should organize short-term health shock campaigns, and each county should be required to cultivate a "four-without" point, and each district should develop several key areas for eliminating the "four pests." Areas where plague has occurred, areas where malaria is prevalent, and areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent should create areas without insects, fleas, mosquitoes, and snails. At the same time, it was also decided to launch a large-scale patriotic health shock campaign month throughout the province before the Spring Festival. During the shock campaign month, five million rats must be exterminated, and a campaign to discourage spitting will also be launched in cities.

The conference believes that it is entirely possible to make Guangdong a basic "four-without" province within the next eight years. The patriotic health movement has made great achievements in the past few years, initially changing the health conditions of the province and cultivating people's hygiene habits. According to incomplete statistics from the two years since the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) in 1956, the province has cultivated more than 250 key townships (communes) and towns (streets) for eliminating the four pests. For example, Qile Commune in Lechang County and Anpu Town in Lianjiang County, which are famous throughout the country, have made remarkable achievements and set up banners. The conference believes that as long as we strengthen leadership, closely integrate with production, and fully mobilize the masses, we can realize this plan.

The conference was held from December 17th to 29th, with more than 300 representatives attending. At the meeting, the representatives exchanged experiences in carrying out the patriotic health campaign. The representatives also visited Qile Commune in Lechang County for study.

People's Daily, Jinan, 12th. In 1958, create one county and city each that are basically "three clean and four without" (three clean means clean indoors, courtyards, and streets; four without means no flies, mosquitoes, rats, or sparrows), each county also creates one basically "three clean and four without" district, and each district must have a "three clean and four without" township. This is the goal set for the province by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee at a standing committee meeting held on the 8th to discuss carrying out the patriotic health movement.

This preliminary plan is achievable. In 1957, the patriotic health movement in Shandong Province made great achievements. There were 7,359 units, such as villages, streets, agencies, schools, and factories that were "three clean and four without" (clean indoors, courtyards, and streets; no flies or rats indoors, no maggots in toilets, no mosquito larvae in courtyards, and no sparrows around the village). Yangxin County, a provincial health model county, had only five health model villages before 1955, but in 1956, more than 300 appeared, and in 1957, there were 556 "three clean and four without" villages, accounting for 66.1% of the total number of villages in the county. Dongbai Village, a provincial health model village, has persisted in the hygiene movement for seven years and has basically eliminated dysentery, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal infectious diseases. The amount of fertilizer accumulated has increased year by year, and grain production has also continued to increase. Chengwu County, a severely flooded county in southwestern Shandong, did not experience any infectious diseases after the disaster because the development of the health campaign was closely integrated with the production and disaster relief campaign. In 1957, 76 "three clean and four without" villages also appeared, 45 more than in 1956. At present, Qingdao has proposed to strive to become a "three clean and four without" city in 1958, and Gaotang, Yangxin, Pingyin and other counties have also proposed to strive to become "three clean and four without" counties this year or next year.

While a high tide of the province-wide movement to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene is gradually forming, the leadership of a few counties is far behind the situation and the masses. Some county party committees have not yet grasped this work well, and some do not even have a simple health work plan. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have decided to issue instructions again. In addition to proposing specific goals for creating "four without" cities, counties, districts, and townships this year, and promoting effective methods for eliminating the four pests, and instructing relevant departments to strengthen scientific and technical guidance, they will especially emphasize strengthening the leadership of the Party and vigorously mobilizing the masses, calling on cadres and Party members to take the lead and set an example, advocate doing a good job at the grassroots level, earnestly summarize experience, reward models, cultivate activists, and organize visits, evaluations, competitions, and strengthen inspection and publicity work.

    有领导　有规划　除尽四害
    广东批判保守思想，要求在八年内成为“四无”省
    山东今年将创造“四无”县市和大批“四无”区乡
    新华社广州12日电　广东省要在今后八年内基本上消灭“四害”，成为“四无省”，这是最近在乐昌县城举行的广东省爱国卫生运动经验交流会议决定的。
    广东省消灭“四害”将分三个阶段进行：今年发展及巩固提高试点；五年突击和普及；最后两年扫尾。
    这次会议批判了对除“四害”信心不足的右倾保守思想，很多县市都订出在五、六年内成为基本“四无”县市的初步规划。龙川县已培养了三十多个消灭“四害”的工作点，订出在五年内基本成为“四无县”的规划。广州市也在卫生工作已经取得成绩的基础上，初步规划在六年内基本成为“四无”市。
    为保证逐步实现这个规划，会议决定今年首先要做好粪便管理和积肥，大力进行厕所、粪池的改良工作。城市和农村都要组织短期卫生突击运动，并要求各县都要培养一个“四无”点，每个区发展几个消灭“四害”重点，曾经发生过鼠疫的地区、疟疾流行地区和血吸虫病流行地区要创造无虫、无蚤、无蚊和无钉螺地区。同时还决定春节前在全省范围内全面开展大规模的爱国卫生突击运动月。在突击运动月要扑灭老鼠五百万只，在城市还要开展一次劝导不随地吐痰运动。
    会议认为，在今后八年内使广东成为基本“四无”省是完全可能的。过去几年来爱国卫生运动取得了很大成就，初步改变了全省的卫生状况，培养了人民讲卫生的习惯。据从1956年全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布后两年来的不完全统计，全省培养了二百五十多个消灭四害工作重点乡（社）镇（街），其中如全国著名的乐昌县歧乐社，廉江县安铺镇都已做出了显著成绩，树立了旗帜。会议认为，只要加强领导，紧密结合生产，充分发动群众，就可以实现这个规划。
    这次会议是在12月17日到29日举行的，出席会议的代表共三百多人，会上，代表们交流了开展爱国卫生运动的经验，代表们还曾到乐昌县歧乐社参观学习。
    本报济南12日电　在1958年创造基本上三洁四无（三洁是室内、院内、街道清洁；四无是无蝇、无蚊、无鼠、无雀）的县、市各一个，每个县也创造一个基本上三洁四无区，每个区要有一个三洁四无乡。这是中共山东省委于8日召开常委会讨论开展爱国卫生运动时，向全省提出的奋斗目标。
    这个初步规划是有条件实现的。1957年山东省爱国卫生运动取得了很大成绩，全省出现了三洁四无（室内、院内、街道清洁；室内无蝇鼠、厕所内无蛆、院内无孑孓，村子周围无麻雀）村庄、街道、机关、学校、工厂等七千三百五十九个单位。全省卫生模范县——阳信县，1955年以前只有五个卫生模范村，1956年就出现了三百多个，1957年已有五百五十六个三洁四无村，占全县村庄总数的66.1％。全省卫生模范村东柏村坚持七年卫生运动，至今已基本上消灭了痢疾、腹泻等肠胃传染病，积肥数量年年增加，粮食产量也不断增加。鲁西南的特重水灾县城武县，由于在开展生产救灾运动中密切结合了开展卫生运动，全县灾后并没有发生传染病。1957年还出现了七十六个三洁四无村，比1956年多了四十五个。目前，青岛已经提出要在1958年争取成为三洁四无城市，高唐、阳信、平阴等县也提出要争取在今年或明年成为三洁四无县。
    在全省除四害、讲卫生运动高潮逐步形成的同时，仍有少数县的领导远远落在形势和群众的后面。有的县委还没好好地抓这项工作，有的连个简单的卫生工作规划都没有。省委和省人民委员会已决定再次发布指示，除了提出今年创造四无市、县、区、乡的具体目标，并推广有效的除四害的办法、责成有关部门加强科学技术指导以外，将特别强调加强党的领导和大力发动群众，号召干部和党员带头以身作则，提倡搞好基点，认真总结经验，奖励模范，培养积极分子，并组织参观评比，发动竞赛，加强检查与宣传工作。
