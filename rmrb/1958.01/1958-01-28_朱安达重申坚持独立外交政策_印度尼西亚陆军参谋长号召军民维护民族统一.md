Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 27th: Indonesian Prime Minister Juanda, in a report to Parliament today on the struggle to liberate West Irian, reaffirmed that Indonesia, regardless of the strong reactions from Western countries, will continue to pursue an active and independent foreign policy.

Juanda pointed out that judging from the strong reactions of Western countries, it appears they will take economic blockade actions. Doing so would cause governments lacking strong confidence in national strength to abandon their active and independent policies. However, the current Indonesian government fully implements active and independent policies in both political and economic aspects, not based on opportunistic principles. The current government will resolutely implement its policies, and there will be no change to the currently pursued policy line.

The Indonesian Prime Minister said that the Indonesian government insists that the course currently taken by the government is the best way to realize the ideal of a unified Republic of Indonesia, despite the many obstacles within Indonesia and abroad.

Juanda once again stated that the Netherlands should take the initiative in resolving the dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands. Indonesia is in no hurry to negotiate with the Netherlands.

Referring to the achievements of President Sukarno's visits to some Asian-African countries and Yugoslavia, Juanda said that after Sukarno's visits, these countries' support for Indonesia stemmed from a deeper understanding of the ideals and strength of the Indonesian nation.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 27th: Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Nasution issued an order on Medan Radio on the evening of the 26th, calling on the Indonesian armed forces, national law enforcement agencies, and the people to maintain national vigilance and safeguard national unity.

Nasution said that the Netherlands and other colonialist forces are plotting to divide Indonesia, and there is also a small group of people in Indonesia who are plotting to establish another country or government. Therefore, national vigilance must be maintained at all times.

The Army Chief of Staff said that the acting commander of the Indonesian First Military Region, the commander of the Second Military Region, and the commander of the Aceh Defense Region have all expressed to him that they consider secessionist and centrifugal activities to be treasonous acts, and such activities will not receive support from them.

The Indonesian Army Chief of Staff went to Sumatra on the 23rd to investigate the conspiracy to establish a "Sumatra State" and the issue of barter trade.

    朱安达重申坚持独立外交政策
    印度尼西亚陆军参谋长号召军民维护民族统一
    据新华社雅加达27日电印度尼西亚总理朱安达今天在国会作关于争取解放西伊里安的斗争的报告时，重申印度尼西亚不管西方国家的强烈反应，继续奉行积极的独立的外交政策。
    朱安达指出，从西方国家的强烈反应来判断，看来它们会采取经济封锁的行动，这样做是会使那些对民族力量缺乏坚强信心的政府放弃它的积极的、独立的政策的。但是，印度尼西亚现政府在政治和经济方面充分实行积极的和独立的政策，不是以机会主义原则为基础的。现政府将坚决执行它的政策，对于目前奉行的政策路线不会有改变。
    印度尼西亚总理说，印度尼西亚政府坚持认为，政府目前所采取的路线是实现一个统一的印度尼西亚共和国的理想的最好的方法，尽管在印度尼西亚国内和国外有许多障碍。
    朱安达再一次表明，在解决印度尼西亚和荷兰的争执的问题上，应该由荷兰采取主动。印度尼西亚并不急于要同荷兰谈判。
    朱安达在谈到苏加诺总统访问一些亚非国家和南斯拉夫的成就时说，在苏加诺进行访问之后，这些国家对印度尼西亚的支持，是出自对印度尼西亚民族的理想和力量的更深刻的了解。
    据新华社雅加达27日电　印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安26日晚上在棉兰电台发布命令，号召印度尼西亚武装部队、国家执法机关和人民，保持民族警觉和维护民族统一。
    纳苏蒂安说，荷兰和其他殖民主义力量策划分裂印度尼西亚，在印度尼西亚也有一小撮人阴谋建立另外一个国家或政府，因此，无论任何时候都必须保持民族警觉。
    这位陆军参谋长说，印度尼西亚第一军区代理司令、第二军区司令和亚齐防区司令都已经向他表示，他们认为分裂和离心的活动是一种叛国的行为，这种活动不可能从他们那里得到支持。
    印度尼西亚陆军参谋长是在23日前往苏门答腊的，他到那里去调查关于建立“苏门答腊国”的阴谋活动以及关于换货贸易的问题。
