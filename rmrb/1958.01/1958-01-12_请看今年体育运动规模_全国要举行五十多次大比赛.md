Xinhua News Agency, 11th - The year 1958 will see even more frequent domestic sports competition activities. From late January to December, more than thirty national and over twenty relatively large-scale sports competitions will be held successively in various locations, averaging about five times per month.

In order to rapidly and substantially cultivate new talent, relevant leading departments have made more arrangements for youth sports competitions this year, with ten national sports competitions specifically for young people. One of these is the National Student Ice Sports Meet, scheduled to begin in Jilin City in late January, which will be the first national sports competition this year. This summer, the National Middle School Track and Field Meet will be held in Qingdao, and the National Student Swimming and Diving Championships will be held in Dalian, both on a large scale. In addition, there will be national or relatively large-scale youth basketball, volleyball, football, table tennis, tennis, gymnastics, and weightlifting competitions.

This year will see the first National Road Cycling Championships and the National Marathon Championships. These two competitions are scheduled to be held in Changchun and Beijing in May and November, respectively.

Some of the larger-scale national sports competitions to be held this year include the National Spring Track and Field Meet in Guangzhou in February, the National Track and Field Correspondence Competition in various parts of the country in May, the National Wushu (Martial Arts) Meet starting in Beijing in September, and the National Workers' Track and Field and Weightlifting Correspondence Meets in various parts of the country in September. National sports competitions will reach their peak in October. This month, the National Wrestling Championships will be held in Tianjin, the National Water Polo Championships in Beijing, and the National Table Tennis Championships, the National Gymnastics Championships, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Track and Field, Swimming, and Handball Games in Guangzhou. The 1958 National Weightlifting Championships will be held in Xi'an in November. The National Chess Championships will be held in Guangzhou in November.

The traditional national football, basketball, and volleyball leagues will continue to hold round-robin competitions this year according to the different levels of each team. The first stage of the first round of the National Football League (Tier A) will begin in late March in the Shanghai-Nanjing competition zone and the Beijing-Tianjin competition zone. The first stage of the first round of the National Volleyball League (Tier A) will also begin in March, simultaneously in the Tianjin and Wuhan competition zones. The first round of the National Basketball League (Tier A) will begin in Shanghai in April. The top two teams in last year's National Football, Basketball, and Volleyball Leagues (Tier B or Tier C) will participate in this year's League (Tier A or Tier B), respectively. The bottom two teams in last year's League (Tier A or Tier B) will participate in this year's League (Tier B or Tier C), respectively. In order to adapt to the widespread development of basketball in China, the Sports Commission will expand the scale of the National Basketball League (Tier C) this year, planning to increase the existing thirty-one men's teams and twenty-four women's teams to about eighty teams each. The number of teams in the volleyball and football leagues (Tier B) will also be increased to more than fifty teams each.

In recent years, table tennis has become more widespread in China, so in addition to holding national table tennis championships, the Sports Commission is also preparing to hold some championships or matches between cities or different units.

This year, national or relatively large-scale baseball, tennis, badminton, handball, skiing, archery, boxing, rowing, sailing, fencing, and acrobatics competitions or performances will also be held. Among them, the Five-Unit Sailing Performance in Wuhan in September and the Seven-City Women's Handball Championships in Shanghai in November are both firsts in our country.

    请看今年体育运动规模
    全国要举行五十多次大比赛
    新华社11日讯　1958年国内体育竞赛活动将更加频繁。从1月下旬开始到12月止，将有三十多次全国性的和二十多次规模比较大的体育竞赛陆续在各地举行，平均每个月要举行五次左右。
    为了迅速地、大量地培养新生力量，有关领导部门今年对青少年的体育竞赛活动作了更多的安排，专门为青少年举办的全国性体育比赛就有十次。其中之一就是全国学生冰上运动会，定1月下旬开始在吉林市举行，将是今年的第一次全国性体育比赛。今年暑期，将在青岛举行全国中学生田径运动会，在旅大举行全国学生游泳、跳水锦标赛，规模都很大。此外，还有全国性的或规模比较大的青少年篮球、排球、足球、乒乓球、网球、体操和举重等比赛。
    今年将第一次举行全国公路自行车锦标赛和全国马拉松锦标赛。这两项比赛预定5月和11月分别在长春和北京举行。
    今年将要举行的一些规模比较大的全国性体育比赛，包括有2月间在广州举行全国春季田径运动会，5月间在全国各地分别举行全国田径通讯比赛，9月开始在北京举行全国武术运动会和在全国各地分别举行全国职工田径、举重通讯运动会等。10月间，全国性体育竞赛将达到高潮。这个月将在天津举行全国摔跤锦标赛，在北京举行全国水球锦标赛，在广州举行全国乒乓球锦标赛、全国体操锦标赛和中国人民解放军全军田径、游泳、手球运动会。1958年的全国举重锦标赛，11月间将在西安举行。全国棋类锦标赛，11月间将在广州举行。
    传统性的全国足、篮、排球联赛，1958年仍按照各个球队的不同等级，分别举行循环比赛。全国足球甲级队联赛第一循环第一阶段比赛，3月下旬将在上海、南京竞赛区和北京、天津竞赛区开始举行。全国排球甲级队联赛第一循环第一阶段比赛，也将在3月开始在天津和武汉两个竞赛区同时举行。全国篮球甲级队联赛的第一循环比赛，4月开始将在上海举行。去年全国足、篮、排球乙级队或丙级队联赛的前两名，今年都将分别参加甲级队或乙级队的联赛。而去年甲级队或乙级队联赛的末两名，今年都将分别参加乙级队或丙级队的联赛。为了适应中国篮球运动普遍开展的具体情况，体育运动委员会今年将扩大全国篮球丙级队联赛的规模，准备把原有的三十一个男子队和二十四个女子队各增加到八十个队左右。排球和足球乙级队联赛的队数，也各增加到五十个队以上。
    近两年来中国的乒乓球运动有了比较普遍的开展，因此除了举行全国性的乒乓球锦标赛以外，体育运动委员会还准备举行一些城市间或不同单位间的锦标赛或对抗赛。
    今年，还要举行全国性的或规模比较大的棒球、网球、羽毛球、手球、滑雪、射箭、拳击、划船、帆船、剑击和技巧等运动的比赛或表演。其中，9月间在武汉举行五单位帆船表演，11月间在上海举行七城市女子手球锦标赛，在我国都还是第一次。
