Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 25th: Dr. Weaver, a director of the U.S. National Science Foundation and former President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, has accused the U.S. government of being "foolish" in obstructing and restricting scientists from socialist countries from visiting the United States.

Weaver testified before the House Government Information Subcommittee that although the U.S. government agreed in 1955 to invite the International Astronomical Union to hold its plenary meeting in the United States, some government officials are now discussing whether Chinese astronomers should be allowed to attend the meeting. He said that this approach by the U.S. government would "become a laughingstock internationally."

Weaver cited many absurd examples of the U.S. government restricting the movements of Soviet scientists and physicists who recently visited the United States. For example, due to these restrictions, an American female doctor could not invite a Soviet female doctor to her home for dinner. He continued, "If all this were a scene in a comedy, we could at least find some amusement. But, gentlemen, this is how the U.S. government operates!"

    美科学界一领袖
    指责美国铁幕政策
    据新华社25日讯　纽约消息：美国全国科学基金会董事、前“美国科学促进协会”会长韦佛尔博士，指责美国政府阻挠和限制社会主义国家科学家访问美国是“愚蠢的”。
    韦佛尔在众院政府情报小组委员会上作证时说，虽然1955年美国政府曾同意邀请国际天文学家协会在美国举行协会的全体会议，但是现在一些政府负责人却在讨论是否应当让中国天文学家参加会议的问题。他说，美国政府的这种做法将“在国际上被传为笑柄”。
    韦佛尔指责美国政府限制不久前访问美国的苏联科学家和物理学家的行动的许多荒谬的例子，例如：由于这种限制，一个美国女医生不能邀请苏联女医生到自己家里去吃饭。他继续说，“假如所有这一切都是喜剧中的情节，我们倒可聊以解闷。可是，先生们，这就是美国政府的行动方法呀！”
