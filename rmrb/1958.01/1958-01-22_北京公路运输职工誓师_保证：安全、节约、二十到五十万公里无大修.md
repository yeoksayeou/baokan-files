Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: More than 17,000 drivers, maintenance workers, and engineering technicians from Beijing's highway transportation enterprises have decided to launch a "Safety, Economy, 200,000 - 500,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul" competition. This target was proposed at the Beijing Highway Transportation Trade Union mass meeting held today.

At today's pledge rally, drivers, maintenance workers, and engineering technicians took turns on stage to declare their fighting goals. Ai Zhaochang, a national advanced producer, had previously driven a "Wan Guo" (International) brand car, achieving 160,000 kilometers without major overhaul. Today, he pledged that the "Jiefang" (Liberation) brand car he is currently driving will run 250,000 kilometers, striving for 300,000 kilometers without major overhaul, 100,000 kilometers without breaking the "spring leaf," and save 1,000 liters of gasoline within 1958. Representatives of the Maliandao depot of the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company pledged at the meeting that they would strive for their freight trucks to travel 250,000 kilometers without major overhaul. Representatives of the 611 team of the Beijing Public Transportation Company, which had already achieved 410,000 kilometers without major overhaul, today proposed a new target of guaranteeing 500,000 kilometers and striving for 650,000 kilometers without major overhaul. Maintenance workers and ticket sellers also pledged at the meeting to cooperate with the drivers to achieve these targets.

Wang Shoudao, Director of the Sixth Office of the State Council, and Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, attended today's meeting and spoke at the meeting. Wang Shoudao said that since the nationwide initiative of "Safety, Economy, 100,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul Movement" was launched in January 1956 by 100 advanced producers, more than 5,800 cars across the country have exceeded 100,000 kilometers without major overhaul, and more than 220 cars have exceeded 200,000 kilometers without major overhaul, with some even reaching over 320,000 kilometers. The new initiative proposed today will receive enthusiastic approval and response from the vast number of workers across the country. In his speech, Lai Ruoyu encouraged the workers of highway transportation enterprises to cooperate closely, work together, give full play to the spirit of collectivism, improve their skills, and learn and promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and our country to ensure the achievement of these targets.

The person in charge of the Beijing Transportation Trade Union told reporters that if all 2,400 freight and passenger cars in the city achieve 200,000 - 500,000 kilometers without major overhaul, it can save the state nearly 9 million yuan in repair costs, and each vehicle can save more than 30 days of major overhaul downtime.

    北京公路运输职工誓师
    保证：安全、节约、二十到五十万公里无大修
    据新华社20日讯　北京市公路运输企业一万七千多名司机、保养工和工程技术人员，已经决定开展一个“安全、节约、二十万——五十万公里无大修”的竞赛运动。这一指标是在今天召开的北京市公路运输工会群众大会上提出的。
    在今天的誓师大会上，到会的司机、保养工和工程技术人员一个接着一个上台宣读自己的奋斗目标。全国先进生产者艾肇昌过去驾驶的“万国”牌汽车，已达到十六万公里无大修。今天，他保证现在驾驶的一辆“解放”牌汽车要行驶二十五万、争取三十万公里无大修，十万公里不断“车弓子”，在1958年内，还要节约汽油一千公升。北京市汽车运输公司马连道车场的职工代表在会上保证，他们要争取货运汽车行驶二十五万公里无大修。已经达到四十一万公里无大修的北京市公共汽车公司六一一车组的代表，今天又提出保证五十万公里、争取达到六十五万公里无大修的新指标。保养工和售票员也在会上保证配合司机，达到这些指标。
    国务院第六办公室主任王首道、中华全国总工会主席赖若愚参加了今天的会议并在会上讲了话。王首道说，1956年1月，全国一百名先进生产者倡议开展“安全、节约、十万公里无大修运动”以来，全国已有五千八百多辆汽车超过十万公里无大修，有二百二十多辆汽车超过二十万公里无大修，有的甚至达到三十二万公里以上。今天提出的这个新的倡议，将得到全国各地广大职工的热烈赞同和响应。赖若愚在讲话中勉励公路运输企业职工，要配合一致，互相协作，发挥集体主义精神，提高技术，学习、推广苏联和我国的先进经验，来保证达到这些指标。
    北京市运输工会负责人告诉记者，如果全市二千四百多辆货运和客运汽车，都达到二十万——五十万公里无大修，可以为国家节约近九百万元的检修费，而且每部车能节省大修车日三十多天。
