Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 24th: Faculty and students at Guangzhou's Sun Yat-sen University have exposed serious instances of waste within the school, demanding that school leaders organize a large-scale debate and take measures to implement the principle of running the school diligently and frugally.

According to the exposures: In recent years, thoughts of blindly pursuing modern equipment and focusing on ostentation have grown within the school. Regardless of need or specifications, various items have been purchased blindly, some even bought simply after seeing their names on a list or in a catalog. Many of the items uncovered during this inspection have remained unopened in their boxes for three or four years. Upon opening these items, some purchasers don't even know what kind of instruments they are. The Biology Department bought a "direct kymograph," a large and precise instrument that only major hospitals need, and which Sun Yat-sen University doesn't need. As a result, no one at the school has yet figured out how to use it. The Invertebrate Zoology Teaching and Research Group of the Biology Department claimed it was "urgently needed" and spent three thousand yuan to buy a universal microscope with already moldy lenses. Not only is it not being used, but it's also not being properly maintained; the lenses have been damaged after being placed in a pile of waste, and the 15x eyepiece has been lost. The Chemistry Department spent eight thousand yuan on a "high-pressure autoclave," but because the school lacks safety equipment and a supply of compressed hydrogen, it hasn't been used in three or four years. The Physics Department has many instruments it doesn't need at all, but the department head, with a sense of departmentalism, would rather let them accumulate than distribute them to other departments. Among them are a "low-frequency oscillator" worth three thousand yuan and a "double circle goniometer" worth seven thousand yuan, as well as several other expensive instruments worth more than a thousand yuan. The school's pharmacy contains an estimated thirteen thousand yuan's worth of medicines. Some drugs are only used in small quantities once a year, yet enough has been purchased to last for twenty or thirty years.

It was also revealed: The Mathematics Building that was just built at the school wasted twenty thousand yuan solely on the basement due to poor design and inappropriate site selection. The Physics and Mathematics Building currently under construction, when completed and added to the existing Physics and Mathematics Building, will accommodate 1,100 students, while the Physics Department actually only has four hundred students.

Currently, the school leadership is determined to "set fire to themselves," continuing to deeply mobilize all faculty and students to further expose instances of waste, and is preparing to organize a special debate to further clarify thinking and better implement the policy of running the school diligently and frugally.

    中山大学引火烧浪费
    盲目追求现代化　一心只顾讲排场
    新华社广州24日电　广州中山大学师生揭露学校严重的浪费现象，要求学校领导上组织大辩论和采取措施贯彻勤俭办学的方针。
    据揭露：近几年来，这所学校里滋长了盲目追求现代化设备、讲排场的思想，不管需要和规格，盲目购买各种东西，有的甚至只是在货单或目录单上看到名目就买。这次检查出来的东西，许多还装在箱子里三、四年原封未动。打开这些东西后，有些连采购人也不知道是什么仪器。生物系买的“直接心动描记器”，是一种大型精密的仪器，只有大医院才需要，中山大学是用不着的，所以直到现在，学校里也还没有人弄清如何用法。生物系无脊椎动物教研组说是“急需”，花了三千元买来一部镜头已经发霉的万能显微镜，既不应用，又不好好保管，镜头被放在废物堆里损坏了，十五倍的接目镜也丢失了。化学系花了八千元买的“高压釜”，因为学校没有安全设备和没有压缩氢气，所以三、四年内一直没有动用。物理系有很多根本用不着的仪器，但系里负责人有本位主义思想宁愿积压起来，也不愿分给其他系。其中有价值三千元的“低频率振荡器”和价值七千元的“双圈测角仪”以及好几件千元以上的贵重仪器。学校药库里的存药，估计共值十三万元，有些一年只用一小点的药品，却买了二、三十年也用不完的份量。
    又据揭露：这个学校刚建好的数学大楼，因设计不周，选地不当，只建地下室一项浪费了二万元。现在正在施工中的物理系数学大楼，建成后加上现在物理系的数学楼一共可以容纳一千一百名学生，而物理系实际上只有四百名学生。
    目前，学校领导上已决心引火烧身，继续深入发动全校师生进一步揭露浪费现象，并准备组织专题大辩论，在大辩论中进一步明确思想，更好地贯彻勤俭办学的方针。
