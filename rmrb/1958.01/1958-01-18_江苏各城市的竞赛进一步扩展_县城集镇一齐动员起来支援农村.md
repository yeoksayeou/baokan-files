Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 16th: The socialist competition centered on supporting the countryside in cities of Jiangsu Province is further expanding to county towns and market towns. Following the launch of socialist competitions by twelve major cities including Nanjing, Taixing County and Baipu Town in Tongru County have respectively proposed to all counties and county-administered towns in the province to participate in this competition.

The proposal of Taixing County was put forward at the county's recent representative meeting of advanced producers. The proposal includes the following four competition conditions: First, fully support agriculture and actively develop industry. In 1958, guarantee the processing of 11,000 tons of oilseeds and 1,400 tons of rice for farmers; trial-produce and produce 21 kinds of pig feed; support the conversion of 120,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields with 3,997 horsepower of machinery, and train 370 drivers and technicians; trial-produce several new products such as chaff cutters, water pumps, gas stoves, and diesel engines. Second, improve the quality and reduce the cost of handicraft products to meet the needs of the countryside. It is required that the total output value of handicraft farm implements in 1958 will increase by 50% compared with 1957, the cost will be reduced by about 5%, and the selling price will be appropriately reduced, striving to achieve high quality and low price, sturdiness and durability; vigorously promote the "three guarantees" system of "guaranteed use, guaranteed exchange, and guaranteed repair." In addition, 16 kinds of products will be produced to support rural water conservancy construction, 20 kinds of products to facilitate pig raising and manure accumulation; 11 kinds of new-style improved agricultural tools, and 110 kinds of old-style iron, wood, and bamboo tools; and it is planned to produce 500 rice threshers, 200 farm boats, 300 waterwheels, as well as tools needed for rural sideline production and various tools for eliminating the four pests. Third, commercial work should adhere to the principle of supporting and guiding agricultural and sideline production, and do a good job in purchasing and supplying in a timely manner. Fourth, banking, grain, culture, education, health and other tasks should serve the development of agricultural production.

In the proposal jointly put forward by the Party members, Youth League members, and cadres of Baipu Town, it is required that the four pests be basically eliminated in the town in 1958; mobilize and organize the town's medical forces to go deep into the countryside to strengthen the publicity of disease prevention, carry out mobile medical services, guide farmers in contraception, help the countryside train midwives, and promote new midwifery methods. The proposal also specifically stipulates a system for staff and teachers of organs, schools, and enterprises to participate in physical labor in fixed agricultural cooperatives around the town, organize cadres and people from all walks of life to go to the countryside in rotation to participate in labor, and require each person to do five to fifteen working days throughout the year. Starting from the second quarter, they plan to send some people to the countryside for short-term stays to eat, live, and work with the farmers, to strengthen the relationship between urban and rural areas, and to change the atmosphere of neglecting agricultural labor.
