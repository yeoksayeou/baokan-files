    Pay Attention to Students' Extracurricular Reading
    I have four children, three in junior high school and one in elementary school. I recently checked my children's homework and found a copy of "Peng Gong An" in my older child's bag. Then, in their drawers, I found some "Seven Swordsmen and Thirteen Heroes," "Arsène Lupin Detective Cases," and some love novels that promoted bourgeois hedonism and corruption. It is said that my eldest child is famous among his classmates for being able to tell stories. He often reads old novels during class. The teacher has criticized him several times, but he never changes. And his grades? He often doesn't finish his homework, and he got four scores of two in algebra. This child failed the exam last semester and was retained this semester as a "probationary student." These situations cannot but cause me great concern. I remember that schools and Communist Youth League organizations used to do a lot of work in guiding students' extracurricular reading. This is a problem that deserves attention. I believe that books are tools for enriching knowledge and guiding people's thoughts. Young students do not yet have a solid foundation of basic knowledge, and their analytical skills are not strong. Therefore, I suggest: (1) Parents should take the initiative to regularly check their children's books and prevent them from reading bad books. (2) The school can launch a large debate among students to discuss the purpose of extracurricular reading? What books should be read? What are the harms of yellow books? (3) Schools can regularly organize students to read the most educational books.

    注意学生课外阅读
    我有四个孩子，三个在初中，一个在小学。我最近检查了一下孩子们的作业，在大孩子书包里，发现了一本彭公案，接着又在他们抽屉里，找出一些七剑十三侠、亚森罗苹侦探案，以及一些宣扬资产阶级享乐腐化的爱情小说等。据说我的大孩子在同学当中是以能说书而出名的，他在上课时，经常看旧小说。老师批评他好几次，总是不改。而他的成绩呢？作业经常完不成，代数有四个两分。这个孩子在前一学期考试就不及格，这个学期是做为“试读生”而被保留下来的。这些情形，不能不引起我很大的忧虑。我记得以前学校和团组织在指导学生课外阅读方面，是做过不少工作的。这是一个值得注意的问题。我认为书籍是用来丰富知识和指导人们思想的工具。青年学生的基本知识还不十分具备，分析力也不强。因此，我建议：（1）家长们应该主动地经常地检查孩子的书籍，不让孩子阅读坏书。（2）学校方面可以在学生中间展开一次大辩论讨论一下课外阅读的目的是什么？应该看些什么书？黄色书籍有哪些害处？（3）学校可经常组织学生阅读最有教育意义的书籍。
