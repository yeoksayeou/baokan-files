Going Deep into Rural Areas, Conducting Investigations and Research, Imparting Technology
The products manufactured by the Xiangyang Agricultural Machinery Factory meet local needs and are well received by farmers; waterwheels piled up in warehouses and double-wheeled double-share plows idled in agricultural cooperatives have all become useful treasures.
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Wuhan, 20th) The local state-owned Xiangyang Agricultural Machinery Factory has strengthened its investigation and research work in rural areas, ensuring that its products meet the requirements of agricultural production. It also actively imparts the technology of using new agricultural implements to farmers. As a result, twenty-one major new products that were trial-produced and improved last year have been well received by the majority of farmers, and the annual production plan was overfulfilled one month ahead of schedule. This year's production plan has increased by one-fold compared to last year, and they are also confidently striving to complete the annual plan half a year ahead of schedule.
    This factory has had dedicated personnel working in rural areas on a long-term basis since 1955. Last spring, they further established a rural investigation and research group to go deep into the countryside to directly solicit farmers' opinions, which serves as the basis for the factory's planning and production improvements. The research group also helps farmers install, test, and repair new agricultural implements in the fields, imparting technology on the spot to ensure that the implements can be effectively promoted in rural areas. In March and June of last year, the research group heard farmers in Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative in Zaoyang County and Zhulinqiao District in Guanghua County say that "New agricultural implements are good, but they only sell new ones and don't support the old ones, so the old ones can't be used when they break." They immediately reported this to the factory and promptly changed the production plan to supply 8,000 sets of parts for three-toothed cultivators and over 80,000 yuan worth of parts for cotton gins to rural areas, which played a role in promoting Hubei's bumper cotton harvest last year.
    Many agricultural cooperatives in the Xiangyang Special District bought double-wheeled double-share plows, but they were idle and unused. After discovering this problem, the research group, under the leadership of the Industrial Section of the Special Commissioner's Office, went to Guanghua, Yunyang, Gucheng, Nanzhang, and other eight counties to impart technology. They first piloted the project in Xinguang Cooperative in Zhutiao District, Xiangyang County. This cooperative had purchased eighteen double-wheeled double-share plows, none of which had been used, and some had already rusted. The research group first adjusted two of them and conducted an operational demonstration in the field, which produced very good results. The cooperative members asked, "It can be used on cultivated land, but can it be used for land reclamation?" The research group then used the method of plowing the land twice to reclaim wasteland, which required one less plowing than the old-fashioned plow, and the results were also very good. The district party secretary immediately summoned cadres from four townships and directors of supply and marketing cooperatives to learn the operating techniques of the double-wheeled double-share plow. At this time, the Hongxing Cooperative in Zhonghao Township had two double-wheeled double-share plows that had been left unused for more than a year and were being carried to the supply and marketing cooperative to be sold as scrap iron. Fortunately, Li Shunbing, a cadre from the supply and marketing cooperative, participated in this technical instruction, and he explained the benefits of this type of plow to the cadres of the Hongxing Cooperative and demonstrated it in the field. As a result, the Hongxing Cooperative not only did not sell the two double-wheeled double-share plows but also bought four new ones.
    In the process of imparting technology, although the farmers agreed that the new plow was better than the old plow, they believed that the new plow was "a long plow with a short rake, which scares the old ox," and requested that the pulling force of the double-wheeled double-share plow be reduced so that the old ox could also pull it. The research group shortened the drawbar by one inch, which reduced the pulling force. Later, the factory further shortened the plow frame by ten centimeters based on the suggestion of Bu Xuezhong, a cadre from the Xiangyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the pulling force of the double-wheeled double-share plow was reduced from 580 jin to below 300 jin. After that, the research group went wherever they were needed to make modifications, so that this modified double-wheeled double-share plow was fully promoted in rural areas.
    The factory had more than 1,000 Liberator-style waterwheels that had been piled up for more than a year and could not be sold. They mistakenly believed that the Liberator-style waterwheel was only suitable for the north and for water wells (as stated in the instructions), and wrongly concluded that they would not produce waterwheels for three years. However, when they helped farmers solve the problem of using waterwheels to draw river water to the shore during last year's drought, they not only sold all the waterwheels that had been piled up but also received orders for 7,000 waterwheels from various places, so that this year's production plan for waterwheels has increased by four and a half times compared to last year.

    深入农村　调查研究　传授技术
    襄阳农业机械厂制造的产品，切合当地需要，得到农民好评；仓库里积压的水车和农业社闲置的双轮双铧犁，都变成了有用的宝物。
    本报武汉20日电　地方国营襄阳农业机械厂到农村加强调查研究工作，使产品切合农业生产要求，并且积极向农民传授使用新式农具的技术，结果去年试制和改良的二十一种主要新产品都得到广大农民的好评，提前一个月超额完成了全年生产计划。今年的生产计划比去年增长一倍，他们还信心百倍地要争取提前半年完成全年计划。
    这个工厂从1955年起就派有专人长期在农村活动。去年春天，他们又进一步建立了农村调查研究组，深入农村去直接征求农民的意见，作为工厂安排计划和改进生产的依据。调研组还在田间帮助农民安装、试验和修配新式农具，当场传授技术，使农具能在农村切实推广。去年3月和6月，调研组分别在枣阳县旭光一社和光化县竹林桥区听见农民反映“新式农具好是好，就是只卖新不配旧，旧的坏了就不能用”，便立即向工厂汇报，及时改变生产计划，供应给农村八千套三齿耘锄的零件和八万多元的轧花机零件，对湖北去年棉花丰产起了促进作用。
    襄阳专区许多农业社买了双轮双铧犁，都闲置着没有用，调研组发现这个问题以后，在专署工业科领导下，分头去光化、郧阳、谷城、南漳等八个县传授技术。他们最先在襄阳县竹条区新光社试点。这个社买了十八部双轮双铧犁，一部也没有用过，有的已经生锈。调研组首先调整了两部，在田间进行操作表演，效果很好。社员问：“熟地能用，开荒行不行？”调研组又用了两遍犁田开荒的办法，比旧式犁少犁一遍，效果也很好。区委书记当即召集四个乡的干部和供销社主任来学习双轮双铧犁的操作技术。这时，中号乡红星社因为有两部双轮双铧犁搁了一年多没用，抬到供销社去当废铁卖，正好供销社的干部李顺炳参加了这次技术传授，他就向红星社的干部说明这种犁的好处，并去田间表演。这样一来，红星社不仅没卖这两部双轮双铧犁，而且又买了四部新的。
    在传授技术中，农民虽然同意新犁比旧犁好，但认为新犁是“长犁短耙，老牛害怕”，要求减轻双轮双铧犁的拉力，使老牛也能拉。调研组把牵引杆向后缩了一寸，拉力便减轻了。后来，工厂又根据襄阳县供销社干部卜学忠的建议，进一步将犁架缩短十公分，双轮双铧犁的拉力便由五百八十市斤减少到三百市斤以下。以后，调研组便走到那里改到那里，使这种改装的双轮双铧犁在农村全面推广。
    这个工厂原有一千多部解放式水车积压了一年多卖不出去，他们就以为解放式水车只适用于北方和水井（说明书也是这样写的），并错误地得出了三年不生产水车的结论。但是，当他们在去年农村抗旱中，帮助农民解决了用水车引河水上岸的问题以后，不仅将积压的水车全部销完，各地又向他们订购了七千部水车，使今年生产水车的计划比去年增长四倍半。
