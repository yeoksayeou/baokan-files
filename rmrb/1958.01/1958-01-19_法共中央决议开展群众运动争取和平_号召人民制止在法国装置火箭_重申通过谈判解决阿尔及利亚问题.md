Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 17th. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary meeting in Saint-Denis, near Paris, on January 15th and 16th, to discuss two agenda items: first, preparations for participating in the provincial council elections to be held in half of France in April of this year; second, the struggle for peace and against atomic armament. The meeting heard reports from Rochet and Casanova on the above agenda items respectively, and passed three resolutions after discussion.

The first resolution passed by the meeting on the issue of striving for peace and opposing atomic armament stated that the U.S. government is currently intensifying international tensions. The decisions adopted at the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to accelerate the nuclear arms race are extremely dangerous decisions. The Gaillard government facilitated the formulation of these decisions and surrendered to the demands of the United States, which is destroying the future of the nation and the lives of the French people. If atomic stockpiles and rocket installations are established on French territory, then France will inevitably become an anti-Soviet, aggressive forward base, and in the event of a conflict, it will become an exposed target for retaliation by those countries forced to defend themselves.

The resolution pointed out that the fundamental task of 1958 should be to carry out the actions of the masses of people in accordance with the line clarified in the Peace Declaration passed in Moscow by the representatives of sixty-four communist and workers' parties. The resolution said that the Party will, in this spirit, intensify its efforts to unite the working class, unite all democratic parties, and unite all vital national forces to strive for an independent French policy that serves world peace.

The Central Committee called on Party organizations at all levels and all Party members to do their utmost to organize mass actions to stop the establishment of rocket launch pads in France and to urge the French government to take the initiative to promote genuine negotiations with the Soviet Union on taking preliminary measures to ease the situation and disarm atomically.

The plenary meeting also called on Communist Party members to assist in the victorious launch of the nationwide signature campaign initiated by the National Peace Council against the deployment of rocket weapons in France.

The second resolution passed by the plenary meeting was a resolution on striving for peace in Algeria. The resolution said that the real solution to the Algerian issue remains to hold negotiations with the representatives of the Algerian people on the basis of recognizing Algeria's right to independence. While upholding and promoting its own主張 (zhǔzhāng, assertions), the French Communist Party once again expressed its willingness to seek compromise solutions with other left-wing parties in order to resolve the Algerian issue through negotiations. Finally, the Communist Party members will strive to make this proposal progress among the masses.

The resolution on preparing for the provincial council elections emphasized two main arguments: first, ending the Algerian war and implementing an independent foreign policy of peace are the main conditions for making it easier to solve the country's financial and economic difficulties and meet the demands of the working people in urban and rural areas. Second, only a government relying on a left-wing majority can implement a new policy of peace, social progress, and national rejuvenation.

The plenary meeting also elected a new draft program drafting committee. The new draft program drafting committee includes Thorez (chairman), Fajon, Rochet, Guigneau (secretary), and others.

Xinhua News Agency, January 17th. TASS Paris, January 16th: More and more French people are protesting against the establishment of rocket bases on French territory.

Etienne Garnier, a Socialist Party member of the National Assembly, said in "Socialist Action" that the French people "absolutely do not want missile launch pads to be set up on their own territory" because "in the event of an atomic war, France would become a very easy target to hit."

The executive committee of the National Association of Republicans Participating in Local Autonomous Organs issued a statement saying that the people of urban and rural France "are deeply disturbed by the constant flights of planes loaded with atomic bombs over France and the threat posed by the establishment of rocket launch bases." The statement called on all members of local autonomous organs "to stand with those who oppose this terrible threat."

According to "Liberation," residents of Alsace and Lorraine are uneasy and opposed to the deployment of U.S. atomic weapons on the Maginot Line and turning the region into a nuclear weapons stockpile.

    法共中央决议开展群众运动争取和平
    号召人民制止在法国装置火箭
    重申通过谈判解决阿尔及利亚问题
    据新华社巴黎17日电　法国共产党中央委员会15日和16日在巴黎近郊的圣但尼举行全体会议，讨论两项议程：第一、准备参加将在今年4月在半个法国举行的省议会选举的工作。第二、争取和平、反对原子军备的斗争。会议听取了罗歇和加桑诺瓦分别就上述议程所作的报告并且在讨论后通过了三项决议。
    会议就争取和平和反对原子军备问题通过的第一项决议说，美国政府目前正在加剧国际紧张局势。北大西洋公约组织最近一次会上通过的加紧进行核军备竞赛的决定是一些极为危险的决定。盖伊阿政府促成了这些决定的制订，并且向美国的要求投降，这就是在摧毁民族的未来和法国人民的生活。如果法国领土上一旦建立了原子储备和火箭装置，那末，法国必然变成反苏的、侵略的前沿基地，而一旦发生冲突，就会成为遭到那些被迫自卫的国家进行回击的暴露的靶子。
    决议指出，1958年的根本任务应该是，根据六十四个共产党和工人党代表在莫斯科通过的和平宣言所阐明的路线来开展人民群众的行动。决议说，党将本着这种精神，加紧努力团结工人阶级，团结各民主党派，团结所有的民族有生力量，争取实现为世界和平服务的法国独立政策。
    中央委员会号召各级党组织、全体党员竭力组织人民群众的行动来制止在法国设置火箭发射台，促使法国政府采取主动促进同苏联举行关于采取初步措施以求缓和局势和解除原子军备的真诚谈判。
    全体会议还号召共产党员协助胜利地开展全国和平理事会发起的征集反对在法国配置火箭武器的签名运动。
    全体会议通过的第二项决议是关于争取阿尔及利亚和平的决议。决议说，真正解决阿尔及利亚问题的办法仍然是在承认阿尔及利亚独立权利的基础上同阿尔及利亚人民的代表举行谈判。法国共产党一方面维护并且宣扬自己的主张，但是另一方面再次表示愿意同其他左派政党谋求折衷方案以求通过谈判来解决阿尔及利亚问题。最后，共产党员们将努力使得这一主张在群众中取得进展。
    会议通过的关于准备省议会选举的决议着重阐述了两项主要的主张：第一，结束阿尔及利亚战争以及执行独立的和平外交政策，是促使比较容易解决国家财政经济困难和满足城乡劳动人民的要求的主要条件。第二，只有依靠左派多数的政府才能够实现和平的、社会进步的和民族复兴的新政策。
    全体会议还选举了新党纲起草委员会。新党纲起草委员会包括多列士（主席）、法戎、罗歇、谷尼欧（秘书）等人。
    据新华社17日讯　据塔斯社巴黎16日讯：越来越多的法国人抗议在法国领土上设置火箭基地。
    国民议会社会党议员艾蒂恩·加尼埃在“社会主义行动报”上说，法国人民“绝不希望在本国领土上设置导弹发射台”，因为“一旦发生原子战争，法国将会成为一个极容易射中的靶子”。
    参加地方自治机关的共和人士全国协会执行委员会发表了一项声明说，法国城乡人民“对装载着原子弹的飞机经常不断地在法国上空飞行以及建立火箭发射基地而造成的威胁深感不安”。声明号召地方自治机关的所有成员“要同那些反对这一可怕威胁的人站在一起”。
    据“解放报”消息，阿尔萨斯和洛林的居民对于在马其诺防线上设置美国原子武器表示不安和反对把这一地区变成核武器储备库。
