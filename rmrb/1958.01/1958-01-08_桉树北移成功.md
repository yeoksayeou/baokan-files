    Successful Northward Transplantation of Eucalyptus
    (Our newspaper) This newspaper reports that Professor Shen Lusheng of Hunan Agricultural College, after four years of experimentation, has successfully test-planted eucalyptus, a subtropical woody plant, in Changsha.
    Eucalyptus is a leading tree species among subtropical woody plants. It grows rapidly, reaching a height of three to four meters in the first year after planting. The wood is strong and durable, with a wide range of uses. In addition to being used for building cargo ships, trains and streetcar carriages, underground structures, etc., it can also be used as railway sleepers and utility poles. Through dry distillation, the wood can yield wood tar, resin, acetic acid propanol, and other substances. The branches and leaves can also be used to extract various valuable aromatic oils for use in medicine, fragrances, and mining.
    In China, eucalyptus growth has been limited to some areas of South China. In order to expand its planting area and cultivate cold-resistant varieties, Professor Shen Lusheng, director of the Forestry Teaching and Research Group of Hunan Agricultural College, began experiments on the northward transplantation of eucalyptus using root pruning methods in 1953. In the second winter of the experiment (1954), the transplanted eucalyptus seedlings were frozen to death. Later, further root pruning measures were taken on the emerging eucalyptus trees, which enabled the eucalyptus trees to successfully survive the severe winter and enhanced their cold resistance. In early spring of last year, Changsha suffered an unprecedented low temperature, and other tree species were severely damaged, while the eucalyptus trees still stood firm in the cold wind, which fully proved that eucalyptus had been successfully transplanted in Changsha.
    In order to make the experimental eucalyptus trees flower and bear fruit earlier, Professor Shen Lusheng adopted a method of wrapping the tree trunk with iron wire to prevent the downward flow of nutrients, and obtained the first batch of seeds from the experimental eucalyptus trees (see the picture below). After these seeds were sown in the spring of 1957, they grew into very strong seedlings.
    Currently, the eucalyptus trees used for the experiment are as tall as five meters and are still growing very well. This experiment is of great significance for production practice. Professor Shen Lusheng is summarizing this experiment and has begun using the same method to conduct transplantation experiments on rubber trees, and expects to achieve good results. (Chen Xiping)

    桉树北移成功
    本报讯　湖南农学院沈鲁生教授经过四年试验，使亚热带木本植物——桉树在长沙市试植成功。
    桉树是亚热带木本植物中首要的树种。它生长迅速，栽植后头一年，便高达三到四公尺。木材坚固耐久，用途极为广泛，除用作造货轮、火车和电车箱、地下建筑物等外，还可用作枕木、电柱。木材经过干馏，可获得木焦油、树脂、醋酸丙醇等物；枝叶尚可提炼各种贵重的芳香油，供医药、香料和冶矿等用。
    我国桉树的生长仅限于华南部分地区。为了扩大其种植面积，培育出耐寒的品种，湖南农学院森林学教研组主任沈鲁生教授从1953年起便用疏根的方法进行了桉树北移的试验。试验的第二年冬（1954年），移植的桉树幼苗被冻死了。以后在萌芽出来的桉树中，采取了进一步疏根的措施，才使桉树顺利地通过了严冬，并增强了耐寒力。去年初春，长沙遭到历来从未有过的低温，其它树种均被严重摧残，而桉树仍然挺立在寒风里，这充分证明了桉树在长沙已经移植成功了。
    为了使试验的桉树提早开花结实，沈鲁生教授采取了用铁丝缠绕树干、制止养分下流的办法，获得了试验桉树的第一批种子（见下图）。这些种子在1957年春播下后，又长出了非常健壮的幼苗。
    现在，供试验的桉树已高达五公尺，生长仍非常良好。这一试验，对生产实践有着非常重大的意义，沈鲁生教授正在对这一试验进行总结，并已开始用同样的方法对橡胶树进行移植试验，预期能得到良好结果。　（陈希平）
