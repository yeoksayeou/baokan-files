Success Depends on Human Effort
Sun Guang

We communists must proceed from reality in everything we do. The same is true for industrial production. However, emphasizing proceeding from reality does not mean shrinking back and stagnating in the face of objective difficulties. Emphasizing proceeding from reality does not hinder us in mobilizing all positive factors, making every effort to turn unfavorable factors into favorable ones, so that we can move forward with big strides. For example, the shortage of raw materials in some enterprises is an objective difficulty. If we can vigorously eliminate waste in the use of raw materials, actively utilize substitutes, and open up new sources of raw materials, we can change the original objective conditions. For another example, if the equipment capacity is low, we can take necessary technical measures to improve the equipment capacity. If the product sales are not good, we should earnestly investigate the actual needs, change the product varieties according to the needs, or increase the product varieties to expand sales. In this way, we can change the original unfavorable objective conditions. The news about the Beijing Food Factory published today is an example.

The raw materials used in this factory are in short supply in almost every aspect. The shortage of sugar alone is two-thirds. If this factory formulates a plan based on this situation, many products will have to stop production. However, they did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. They analyzed the objective situation at the time and believed that China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and if something is not available in the east, it may be available in the west. If many raw materials cannot be bought in Beijing, we can still find ways to go to the producing areas; if we can't buy them in the producing areas, we can still use substitutes. Therefore, they fully mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, sent people to find sources of goods everywhere, and used substitutes. As a result, they found solutions from the difficulties and not only completed the original plan but also increased production.

For everything, there is a positive side and a negative (difficult) side. To carry out socialist construction in our "poor and blank" country, and to catch up with Britain in fifteen years, there are many difficulties. At present, the production of our textile industry, food industry, and light industry is more or less restricted by the supply of agricultural raw materials. However, we do not sigh in the face of difficulties, but use revolutionary spirit to try every means to overcome difficulties. There is an old Chinese saying that "success depends on human effort," which means that there are no insurmountable difficulties. All enterprises should embrace this attitude, mobilize all positive factors, and set the production targets for 1958 more actively and more advanced.

    事在人为
    孙光
    我们共产党人做任何事情，都要从实际出发。工业生产也是一样。但是，强调从实际出发，并不等于在客观困难面前缩手缩脚，停滞不前。强调从实际出发，丝毫不妨碍我们为了调动一切积极因素，千方百计地变困难因素为有利因素，使我们能大步前进。例如某些企业原料不足是个客观困难，如果我们能大力消除原材料使用中的浪费现象，积极利用代用品，开辟新的原料来源，就可以改变原来的客观条件。又如设备能力低，我们可以采取必要的技术措施来提高设备能力。产品销路不好，我们就应当切实调查实际需要，根据需要改变产品品种，或者增加产品品种来扩大销路。这样，就可以改变原来对我们不利的客观条件。今天发表的北京食品厂的消息就是一个例子。
    这个厂生产用的原料，几乎样样都不足，仅砂糖一项，就差三分之二。如果这个厂根据这个情况制订计划，将有很多产品要停止生产。但是，他们没有在困难面前低头，他们分析了当时的客观情况，认为中国地大物博，东方不亮西方亮，许多原料在北京买不到，还可以到产地去想办法；产地买不到，还可以用代用品。于是他们充分发挥了群众的积极性和创造性，派人四出寻找货源，用代用品，结果从困难中找到了办法，不但完成了原来的计划，而且增加了生产。
    做任何一件事情，都有积极的一面和消极（困难）的一面。要在我们这个“又穷又白”的国家进行社会主义建设，要在十五年内赶上英国，困难是很多的。目前我国纺织工业、食品工业和轻工业的生产，都或多或少的受到农业原料供应的限制。但是，我们不在困难面前唉声叹气，而是用革命精神想尽一切办法去战胜困难。中国有句古话叫“事在人为”，意思是说没有什么克服不了的困难。一切企业都应当抱着这种态度，调动一切积极因素，把1958年的生产指标订得更积极更先进些。
