Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th – In order to suppress the increasingly strong anti-American and anti-Rhee sentiments of the South Korean people, the Syngman Rhee clique has recently adopted a series of fascist measures such as arrests and suppression.

    According to a report from the Hapdong News Agency, in the forty days from December 1st of last year to January 10th of this year alone, Syngman Rhee's military police arrested and detained 10,959 people under various "charges."

    Cho Bong-am and Kim Dal-ho, leaders of the South Korean Progressive Party, had previously made statements advocating peaceful reunification of Korea and were therefore arrested by Syngman Rhee's police on January 13th. The Syngman Rhee authorities also announced that these arrested opposition leaders would not be able to participate in the upcoming National Assembly elections.

    During this period, the Syngman Rhee clique also engaged in literary inquisition on a large scale at Seoul National University. A student named Yu Geun-il from the Department of Political Science at Seoul National University was arrested by the Syngman Rhee authorities on December 13th of last year because he mentioned in an article written for the school newspaper that the people yearned for the emergence of a new motherland.

    These reactionary measures of the Syngman Rhee clique have aroused even stronger opposition from the South Korean people.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th – More than 800 people from Pyongyang's journalistic and cultural circles held gatherings on the 16th and 17th to support and express solidarity with the South Korean journalistic circles' struggle against the Syngman Rhee clique's suppression and censorship of speech. The assembly passed a letter of encouragement to the South Korean journalistic circles.

    The Syngman Rhee clique, manipulating the South Korean National Assembly, passed a reactionary election law on January 1st of this year designed to facilitate the Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party's continued control of the National Assembly in this year's elections. The South Korean Newspaper Editors Association has held several meetings to condemn this measure by the Syngman Rhee clique. This association also held a meeting on the 11th and called on foreign journalistic circles to support their struggle.

    李承晚集团肆行法西斯镇压
    在四十天内逮捕和拘禁了一万多人
    平壤文化界声援南朝鲜人民的斗争
    据新华社平壤18日电　为了压制南朝鲜人民的日益强烈的反美反李情绪，李承晚集团最近采取了一系列捕人、镇压等法西斯措施。
    据合同通讯社消息，仅在去年12月1日到今年1月10日的四十天内，李承晚的军警借各种“罪名”逮捕和拘禁了一万零九百五十九人。
    南朝鲜进步党首领曹奉岩、金达镐等人曾经发表过主张和平统一朝鲜的言论，因而在1月13日被李承晚警察逮捕。李承晚当局并且宣布这些被捕的反对党首领们将不能参加正在临近的国会选举。
    李承晚集团在这一期间还在汉城大学大兴文字狱。汉城大学政治系的一个名叫俞根一的学生曾经在一篇为校刊写的文章中提到人民大众渴望新的祖国出现的字句，因而就在去年12月13日遭李承晚当局逮捕。
    李承晚集团的这种反动措施，引起了南朝鲜人民更强烈的反对。
    据新华社平壤18日电　平壤的新闻界和文化界人士八百多人在16、17两日举行集会，支持和声援南朝鲜新闻界反对李承晚集团压制和封锁言论的斗争。大会通过了致南朝鲜新闻界的鼓励书。
    李承晚集团操纵南朝鲜国会在今年1月1日通过了一项为便于李承晚的自由党在今年的选举中继续控制国会而制造的反动的选举法。南朝鲜新闻编辑协会已经几次集会谴责李承晚集团的这项措施。这个协会在11日举行的一次集会上并且呼吁外国新闻界支持他们的斗争。
