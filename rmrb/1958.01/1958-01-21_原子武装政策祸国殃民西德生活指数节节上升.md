Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: West German prices are continuously rising. According to a spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party's parliamentary group in the West German Bundestag, seventy-three kinds of commodities in West Germany have increased in price in the four months since the West German election in September of last year.

According to official figures published by the West German government, which are lower than the actual figures, the West German cost of living index increased by 3.3% last year, 18% higher than in 1950, and 83% higher than in 1938.

The West German government recently decided to increase train ticket prices from February 1st. This primarily affects the interests of workers who live far from their workplace and must take the train to work. According to the government's decision, the price of season tickets commonly used by workers will increase by 50%.

The government has also decided to increase sugar prices from February 1st and postal rates from April 1st.

In view of the increasing signs of stagnation in West German economic activity, the West German authorities are adopting a policy of expanding credit to stimulate industrial investment and expand arms production. The Central Bank Council of the West German Federal Bank announced on the 16th that the discount rate of West German banks would be lowered from 4% to 3.5%. This practice will further worsen the trend of rising prices and inflation.

"Bonn Correspondence," in discussing the issue of West German prices, said: "Prices are rising, and will continue to rise. Why? Erhard (Minister of Economics) frankly replied: Because the Federal Republic must seek the material and financial resources required by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to establish the atomic and rocket armament of the Bundeswehr. The cost of this armament must be paid by the citizens of the Federal Republic."

    原子武装政策祸国殃民西德生活指数节节上升
    新华社20日讯　西德物价接连上涨。据西德社会民主党联邦议院党团发言人指出，去年9月西德大选后的四个月里，西德已经有七十三种商品涨了价。
    根据西德政府发表的低于实际数字的官方数字，去年一年西德生活指数提高了3.3％，比1950年高18％，比1938年高83％。
    西德政府最近又决定从2月1日起提高火车票价。这首先影响到住在离工作地点很远和必须乘火车上工的职工们的利益。根据政府的决定，工人通常使用的季票的票价将上涨50％。
    政府还决定从2月1日起提高食糖价格，从4月1日起提高邮费。
    西德当局鉴于西德经济活动停滞的征象增多，正在采取膨胀信用的政策来刺激工业投资和扩大军火生产。西德联邦银行中央银行理事会16日宣布，西德的银行贴现率从4％降低到3.5％。这种做法将使物价上涨和通货膨胀的趋势更加恶化。
    “波恩通讯”在谈到西德物价问题时说：“物价正在涨，而且还要继续涨。为什么呢？艾哈德（经济部长）直言不讳地回答：因为联邦共和国要寻求北大西洋公约组织所要求的物质上和财政上的资料来建立国防军的原子和火箭武装。这种武装的费用必须由联邦共和国的公民来支付。”
