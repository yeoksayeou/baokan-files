    Dogs Snatching Meat Bones
    
    According to a Reuters report, the U.S. armed forces have recently had new disputes, because the navy snatched most of the more than 600 million U.S. dollars in new missile appropriations. The dispute has escalated to the point that Eisenhower listed it as the first of the eight emergency programs in his "State of the Union Address." News reports say that he will personally take charge of the reorganization of the U.S. military establishment in an attempt to "eliminate the antagonism between the various services."
    
    The disputes in the U.S. armed forces are due to the fact that each of them has a group of monopoly capitalists behind them competing for state military orders. This kind of dog-eat-dog affair is never easy to resolve. Let's see how Eisenhower will preside over the division of spoils for the monopoly capital.

    狗抢肉骨头
    据路透社报道，美国三军最近又发生新的争端，因为新的导弹拨款六亿多美元大部分都被海军抢去了。这个纠纷已经闹到这种程度，以至艾森豪威尔把它列入“国情咨文”八点紧急纲领的第一点。有消息说，他将亲自主管美国军事机构的改组工作，设法“消除各军种之间的对立”。
    美国三军发生这种纠纷，是因为它们背后各有一批垄断资本家在争夺国家的军事定货。这种狗抢肉骨头的事从来是不好解决的，且看艾森豪威尔如何来主持垄断资本的分赃事务。
