No Need to Queue to Buy Grain
The No. 3 Grain Store of the Hexi District Grain Store in Tianjin, based on the opinions of the masses, implemented methods such as pre-processing grain purchase procedures at residents' homes, delivering grain coupons to their doors, and pre-weighing the grain into portions of ten or twenty catties, shortening the time citizens spent buying grain.
    Granny Zhang Yu'en completed the grain purchasing procedures at home and went to the grain store with the delivery note to buy rice, which only took a few minutes. Xinhua News Agency reporter Liang Yiding photo

    买粮不用排队
    天津市河西区粮店第三门市部根据群众意见，实行了到居民家中预办买粮手续、粮票送上门、事先把粮食按十斤或二十斤一份称好等办法，缩短了市民买粮时间。
