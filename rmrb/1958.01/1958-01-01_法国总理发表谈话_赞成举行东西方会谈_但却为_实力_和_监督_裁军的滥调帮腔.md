Xinhua News Agency, December 31st, Paris dispatch: French Premier Félix Gaillard, in a speech on the 30th, stated that he supported holding an East-West "summit" meeting, but a foreign ministers' meeting should be held as soon as possible beforehand to prepare for it. Gaillard's speech was given to "U.S. News & World Report" magazine.

Gaillard said that the East-West summit should mainly discuss disarmament, but such a meeting should not exclude other issues affecting East-West relations. He believes that Western countries should never create the impression in world opinion that they are not as eager as the Soviet Union to reach a disarmament agreement. However, Gaillard also advocated that the West should not relax its work of "strengthening its strength." He believes that Western military blocs "are a necessity in themselves," and that NATO's plans to store missiles and atomic weapons in Western Europe should not be affected by East-West negotiations. He expressed his opposition to the proposal to establish a "nuclear-weapon-free zone" in Central Europe, insisting that this proposal was detrimental to the West. On the issue of disarmament, he still emphasized the so-called "supervision" issue, which the Western bloc has always insisted on solving first.

When asked whether France would be willing to establish intermediate-range ballistic missile bases and store atomic weapons on its territory, Gaillard replied that the French government had not yet made a firm decision and would negotiate these issues with the United States. Gaillard stated that if the United States treated France as a "second-class partner" and did not agree to transfer atomic bombs or warheads to French custody, then France would "engage in the manufacture of its own nuclear weapons." He confirmed in response to another question that France, West Germany, and Italy had signed an agreement to jointly manufacture weapons.

Gaillard also advocated that before holding East-West talks, the United States, Britain, and France should first hold a trilateral meeting and issue a "joint declaration" on the situation in the Middle East, stating that "they will not allow any changes in the political situation in the Middle East." He described the growth of the Syrian people's strength in safeguarding national independence and opposing imperialist interference as "internal subversion activities," believing that this was a phenomenon that the three Western countries needed to deal with. He also advocated expanding the scope of this "declaration" to North Africa in order to create a basis for maintaining France's colonial interests in North Africa and interfering in the internal affairs of independent North African countries.

Gaillard said that France currently expects "most importantly from the United States to help promote a 'common view' on African territories, especially North Africa," while the United States should help France "create the impression in the world on the Algerian issue that this is a French matter and there should be no interference."

While Gaillard regards Algeria as France's exclusive domain, he attempts to erase the increasingly rising struggle of the Algerian people for independence, saying absurdly: "Algerians will not demand independence... because independence is not a rational demand."

### 法国总理发表谈话  赞成举行东西方会谈  但却为“实力”和“监督”裁军的滥调帮腔

    法国总理发表谈话
    赞成举行东西方会谈
    但却为“实力”和“监督”裁军的滥调帮腔
    新华社31日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理盖伊阿在30日发表的一篇谈话中表示，他赞成举行东西方“最高级”会谈，但是事先应该尽早举行一次外长级会议来进行筹备。盖伊阿的这篇谈话是向“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志发表的。
    盖伊阿说，东西方最高级会谈主要应当讨论裁军问题，但是这种会谈也不应该排除影响东西方关系的其他问题。他认为西方国家决不应当在世界舆论面前造成这样的印象：它们并不像苏联那样迫切希望达成一项裁军协定。但是，盖伊阿同时也主张西方不要放松“加强实力”的工作。他认为，西方的军事集团“本身就是一种必要”，北大西洋集团在西欧储存导弹和原子武器的计划不应当受东西方谈判的影响。他表示反对在中欧建立“无原子武器区”的建议，硬说这个建议对西方不利。在裁军问题上，他所强调的仍然是西方集团一贯坚持的首先要解决所谓“监督”的问题。
    在被问到法国是否愿意在它的领土上建立中程弹道导弹基地和储存原子武器时，盖伊阿回答说，法国政府还不曾作出确定的决定，它将同美国就这些问题进行谈判。盖伊阿表示，如果美国把法国当作“次等伙伴”，并且不同意把原子弹或弹头移交给法国保管，那么法国将“从事制造自己的核武器”。他在回答另一个问题时证实，法国、西德和意大利三国已经签订了一项共同制造武器的协定。
    盖伊阿还主张，在举行东西方会谈之前，美英法先举行一次三国会议，并且就中东形势发表一篇“共同宣言”，表明“它们不允许中东政治情况有任何改变”。他把叙利亚人民维护民族独立和反对帝国主义干涉的力量的增长说成是“内部颠复活动”，认为这是西方三国需要加以对付的现象。他还主张把这种“宣言”的范围扩大到北非以便为维护法国在北非的殖民利益和干涉北非独立国家内政制造根据。
    盖伊阿说，法国目前期望于美国的“最重要的是帮助促成一种对非洲属地，特别是对北非的‘共同看法’”，同时美国应当在阿尔及利亚问题上帮助法国在世界上“造成一种印象：这是法国的事情，这里不应当有干涉的问题”。
    盖伊阿一面把阿尔及利亚看作法国的禁脔，一面企图抹杀阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的日益高涨的斗争，他居然说：“阿尔及利亚人不会要求独立……因为独立不是合理的要求。”
