    Domestically Sold Cotton Cloth Does Not Need to Be Starched
    Cotton mills use flour to starch cotton cloth, and the amount used is very large. Beijing State-owned Cotton Mill No. 3 alone returned more than 1,400 flour sacks last October. As far as I know, the only reason for using flour to starch cloth is to make it look better when it is sold. People usually wash the starch off completely after they buy it. Therefore, I suggest that domestically sold cloth should not be starched with flour. This will not only save the country a large amount of grain, but also eliminate the starching process.　Wen Xuetao

    内销的棉布不用上浆
    棉纺织厂浆棉布要用面粉，而且用量很大。仅北京国棉三厂去年10月份就退了一千四百多个面粉袋。据我所知，用面粉浆布只不过是为了在销售的时候美观，人们买去以后，一般都要先把浆完全洗掉。因此我建议，在国内销售的布匹不要用面粉浆，这样不但给国家节约大批粮食，而且可以省掉浆布的工序。　温学涛
