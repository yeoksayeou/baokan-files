The spearhead of anti-waste points to every corner
  Sichuan Provincial Electric Power Bureau employees sharply criticize all aspects of waste

Chengdu, January 14th (Reporter): Employees of the Sichuan Provincial Electric Power Administration (formerly the Southwest Electric Power Administration) raised 147 criticisms during the rectification movement, targeting the serious waste caused by bureaucracy and departmentalism on the part of the leadership. According to materials exposed by employees, this bureau wasted more than 10 million yuan of state funds in basic construction, and also accumulated a large amount of equipment and materials.

The masses of employees criticized the leadership for not paying enough attention to conservation in basic construction. For example, when selecting a site for the Kunming Power Plant, the site selection working group discovered that there was silt under the site and suggested selecting another site. However, the leadership one-sidedly emphasized the urgency of production and did not accept the suggestion to change the site. As a result, they had to drive more than 2,000 piles into the foundation, and the circulating water pipes also had to be lengthened. These two items wasted 3 million yuan of state funds, and it took more than a year to fill the silt. Waste in welfare facilities and auxiliary buildings was also significant. The basic construction period for the Chengdu Power Plant was only three years, but some of the temporary facilities built could be used for as long as eight years, and the cost was higher than the state regulations. Temporary facilities alone accounted for 3% of the power plant's total investment. According to the 1956 national standard, the employee dormitory of this plant should have been 7,818 square meters, which was actually sufficient to meet the needs. However, the power plant leaders repeatedly requested additions, and the leaders of the Electric Power Bureau did not conduct in-depth investigations, and approved the addition of more than 5,000 square meters of dormitory space, resulting in the construction of houses that no one lived in.

According to the masses, the Sichuan Electric Power Administration accumulated and wasted a considerable amount of equipment and materials. In addition to spare materials, the accumulated materials were worth 4 million yuan. The Kunming Power Plant had 500 tons of accumulated ferrous metals. Equipment and materials accumulated during the installation of new machines at the Chengdu Power Plant have been idle for several years, and equipment worth 90,000 yuan is still unused. The supply station's materials are piled up in warehouses, yards, and even on the side of the road. The reason for this serious accumulation of materials is that the leaders required "rather more than less" in terms of equipment supply and blindly purchased materials. At the same time, the equipment supply review system was not sound, and all incorrectly purchased or re-purchased equipment was sent to the warehouse for storage. The masses wrote on a big-character poster entitled "Gifts from the Bureau Chief": The bureau already had a blueprint machine worth more than 200 yuan that could be operated by one person and could meet the needs of the work. However, the bureau chief spent 4,000 yuan and one ton of steel to buy an automatic blueprint machine. Because this blueprint machine required three people, including a technician and a blueprint operator, to operate, it had to be left idle in the warehouse for a long time. The masses also pointed out that when the supply of building materials was tight, the bureau was building office buildings and dormitories. When they heard that Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant needed welding rods, they immediately sent people by plane to transport the remaining three tons of welding rods from the Yunnan Power Plant to the No. 3 Steel Plant in exchange for steel. Because they only cared about their own bureau and blindly purchased materials, they accumulated more than 50 tons of steel.

The masses also made sharp criticisms of the waste in administrative management expenses. Whether they were leading cadres or general cadres, it was common for them to take airplanes when traveling on business, attending meetings, or inspecting work. The twelve cadres of the Planning Department alone took airplanes twenty times from 1955 to 1956.

### 反浪费的矛头指向各个角落  四川省电业局职工对各方面浪费现象提出尖锐批评

    反浪费的矛头指向各个角落
    四川省电业局职工对各方面浪费现象提出尖锐批评
    本报成都14日电　四川省电业管理局（原西南电业管理局）职工在整风运动中针对领导方面官僚主义和本位主义所造成的严重浪费，提出了一百四十七条批评意见。根据职工揭发的材料，这个局在基本建设上浪费了国家资金一千多万元，另外还积压了大量的设备器材。
    职工群众批评领导方面在基本建设中注意节约不够。例如，昆明电厂在选厂时，选厂址工作组发现厂址下面有淤泥，就提议另选，但是领导方面片面强调急于生产，没有接受改选厂址的意见。结果，只好在地基上打两千多根桩，循环水管也不得不加长。这两项共浪费国家资金三百万元，而且填平淤泥花了一年多的时间。福利设施和附属建筑的浪费也不小。成都电厂基本建设施工时间只有三年，但是修建的临时设施，有的却可以使用八年之久，造价也高于国家规定。只是临时设施，就占了电厂全部投资的3％。这个厂的职工宿舍按1956年国家规定标准应该是七千八百一十八平方公尺，实际上已经能满足需要，但是电厂领导屡次要求追加，电业局领导人员也不深入调查，就批准追加宿舍五千多平方公尺，以致修起房子没有人住。
    据群众揭发，四川电业管理局积压和浪费器材相当多，除备用材料外，积压的物资值四百万元。昆明电厂积压的黑色金属就有五百吨。成都电厂安装新机器时积压下的器材，经过几年的处理，到现在还有价值九万元的器材闲置着。供应站的物资堆满仓库、院子，甚至堆到大路旁边。造成这种严重积压物资现象的原因，是领导人员在器材供应方面要求“宁多勿少”，盲目购买；同时，器材供应审核制度也不健全，凡是错购重购的器材一律都送入仓库储备。群众在题为“局长送来的礼品”的大字报上写道：局里已经有价值二百多元的、一人就可操作的晒图机，可以满足工作需要，但是局长又花费了四千元和一吨钢材，买来了一部自动晒图机。由于这部晒图机使用时需要有技术员、晒图员等三人才能操作，只好长期把它闲放在仓库里。群众还提出，正当建筑材料供应紧张的时候，局里却在修建办公大楼和宿舍；听说重庆第三钢厂需要电焊条，便马上派人用飞机把云南电厂剩余的三吨电焊条运到三钢厂换取钢材。由于只顾本局，盲目抢购，积压钢材五十多吨。
    对行政管理费用方面的浪费，群众也提出了尖锐的批评。这个局不论领导干部或一般干部，出差开会、检查工作，坐飞机已是常事。仅计划处十二个干部从1955年到1956年坐飞机的就有二十人次。
