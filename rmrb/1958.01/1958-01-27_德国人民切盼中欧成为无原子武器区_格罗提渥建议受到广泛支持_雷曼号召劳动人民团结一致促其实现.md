Xinhua News Agency report: German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl's proposal for a nationwide referendum on the issue of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe continues to receive broad support from the people of both East and West Germany. Grotewohl reiterated his proposal on the 24th in a speech to the People's Representative Assembly in Döbeln County, Leipzig District.

The 1,300 socialist agricultural activists currently participating in the Second Representative Conference of Machine and Tractor Station Workers in Güstrow, expressed their full support for Grotewohl's proposal.

German Communist Party Central Committee First Secretary Lehmann delivered a speech on "Radio Free Germany 904" on the 24th, supporting the proposal made by German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl to hold a referendum in East and West Germany on the question of whether the two Germanys should participate in a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone.

Lehmann pointed out: After the foreign policy debate in the West German Federal Assembly, the German people are at a crossroads. This parliamentary debate shows that Adenauer's majority is trying to obstruct any steps that would help ease international tensions; they want to make West Germany the center of atomic armament. Lehmann emphasized that it is not enough to limit oneself to parliamentary debates. Only when the working people unite and act in unison can West Germany be made to implement a new policy. He said that the seriousness of the situation requires the leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party to abandon their opposition to the unified action of the working class and to the referendum.

A trade union leader, Schmitz, from Wuppertal in the Ruhr area of West Germany, said: Adenauer's rejection of Poland's proposal to include West Germany in a nuclear-weapon-free zone is causing growing unease among broad sections of the West German population.

Dr. Pielger from Remscheid in North Rhine-Westphalia, West Germany, and the West German cartoonist Picard from Stuttgart also expressed their support for Grotewohl's proposal. Pielger said that the majority of West German residents would agree to West Germany's participation in a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone. Picard believes that Grotewohl's proposal "should be clear and acceptable to every sane person."

    德国人民切盼中欧成为无原子武器区
    格罗提渥建议受到广泛支持
    雷曼号召劳动人民团结一致促其实现
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥关于就在中欧建立无原子武器地区问题举行全德公民投票的建议继续得到东西德人民的广泛支持。格罗提渥24日在来比锡专区德贝林县的人民代表会议上讲话时重申了他的这项建议。
    目前正在居斯特罗夫参加民主德国第二次机器拖拉机站工作人员代表会议的一千三百名社会主义农业积极分子表示完全支持格罗提渥的这项建议。
    德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼24日在“九○四德国自由广播电台”发表演说，支持德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥所提出的关于在东西德就两个德国是否参加中欧无原子武器区问题举行公民投票的建议。
    雷曼指出：西德联邦议院举行外交政策辩论之后，德国人民已经处在十字路口。这次议会辩论表明：阿登纳的多数派力图阻挠任何有助于缓和国际紧张局势的步骤，他们要使西德成为原子军备的中心。雷曼强调指出：限于进行议会里的争论，这是不够的。只有劳动人民联合起来一致行动，才能促使西德实行新的政策。他说，形势的严重性要求西德社会民主党领导人放弃他们对工人阶级统一行动和对公民投票的反对。
    西德鲁尔区窝伯塔尔的一个工会领袖施密茨说：阿登纳拒绝波兰关于把西德包括在一个无原子武器地区内的建议，正在西德的广泛阶层中引起日益增长的不安。
    西德北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州莱姆夏德的皮尔格博士和斯图加特的西德漫画家皮卡德也表示支持格罗提渥的建议。皮尔格说，西德大多数居民都会同意西德参加中欧无原子武器地区。皮卡德认为，格罗提渥的建议“对于每一个思想健康的人说来都应该是清楚的和可以接受的”。
