    Shanxi Corrects Waste in Land Requisition by Basic Construction Departments
    More Than 20,000 Mu of Land Returned to Agricultural Cooperatives
    (Our Newspaper News) The Shanxi Provincial People's Committee has taken active measures to deal with the waste of land in basic construction. Currently, 84 units have returned 23,299 mu of land to agricultural cooperatives for cultivation.
    From 1949 to 1957, some cities and counties in Shanxi Province over-requisitioned some farmland too early during basic construction. The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory requisitioned 127 mu of land in 1950, but due to changes in the plan, two-thirds of the land was wasted. The Yangquan Local Building Materials Factory requisitioned 275 mu of land, but only used 167 mu. The Jiexiu Coal Washing Plant requisitioned 1,083 mu of land but only used 84 mu. The Datong Mining Bureau requisitioned 945 mu of land but only actually used 45 mu. A certain factory in Yangquan requisitioned 1,774 mu of land, wasting 850 mu. There were also serious phenomena of early requisition and late use, requisitioning more than was used, and requisitioning a lot but not using it. According to statistics from the Shanxi Provincial Construction Department: Taiyuan City wasted 6,250 mu of land, Datong City wasted 7,079 mu, Yangquan City wasted 1,280 mu, and twelve units in Yuci City requisitioned a total of 8,849 mu of land, with 63% lying barren and unused. The construction units in other places such as Taigu and Jiexiu also wasted a lot of land.
    The Shanxi Provincial People's Committee requires all localities to conduct another thorough inspection of all land-using units before the spring plowing, adopting the principle of "inspecting while handling," and hand over the requisitioned but unused land to agricultural cooperatives for cultivation.

    山西纠正基本建设部门征用土地的浪费
    二万多亩土地交还农业社
    本报讯　山西省人民委员会积极采取措施，处理在基本建设中浪费的土地，目前已经有八十四个单位把二万三千二百九十九亩土地交还给农业合作社耕种。
    山西省的部分市、县从1949年至1957年在基本建设中过多地早征了一些农田。太原重型机器厂，1950年征购土地一百二十七亩，因计划变更，将三分之二的土地浪费了；阳泉地方建筑材料厂，征购了土地二百七十五亩，因计划变更，只用了一百六十七亩；介休洗选厂征购了一千零八十三亩土地只用了八十四亩；大同矿务局征了九百四十五亩土地，实际只用了四十五亩；阳泉某厂征购土地一千七百七十四亩，浪费了土地八百五十亩。还有些单位早征晚用，征多用少和征多不用的现象也很严重。据山西省建设厅统计：太原市浪费了土地六千二百五十亩，大同市浪费七千零七十九亩，阳泉市浪费了一千二百八十亩，榆次市十二个单位共征购土地八千八百四十九亩，荒而未用的63％。其余如太谷、介休的建设单位浪费了的土地也不少。
    山西省人民委员会要求各地在春耕以前对所有用地单位再进行一次彻底检查，采取“边检查，边处理”的方针，把征而未用的土地交给农业社耕种。（李士昌、张仁德）
