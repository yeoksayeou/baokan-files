What Books to Show Children
Huang Biyun

　　The content of family education is multifaceted, and there are many different educational methods. Choosing appropriate reading materials for children is also an effective educational method.

　　Children love to hear stories, especially younger children, for whom fairy tales are most attractive. For example, "Grandma Wolf," "The Little Goat and the Wolf," and "Good Little Bunny" are already beautiful fairy tales passed down through generations, well-known to every child. Children never tire of fairy tales because the vivid characters, the ideological content, and the rich imagination fill their young hearts with excitement. They share the joy and sadness of the characters in the story; through "sympathy" and "disgust," they begin to recognize "good and evil," "good and bad," "diligence and laziness," "courage and cowardice," and thus receive positive education.

　　Although children aged three to seven cannot read, they already know how to love books. They often hold books and flip through them with relish, pointing to the illustrations and asking adults to tell them the story. Satisfying these legitimate demands of children is an important task.

　　What kind of books should we choose for children? Younger children think through images, sounds, and colors, so picture storybooks are best suited to the age characteristics of young children. The images in the pictures can deepen children's impressions and consolidate their memory. However, those superstitious and fantastical stories, as well as books that reflect corrupt ideas and cruel and terrifying behaviors, will harm the young hearts of children. As for those stories that narrate love, since children cannot understand them, they have no educational value for them.

　　When choosing reading materials for children, we should not only pay attention to the correctness of the ideological content of the book, but also suit the children's intellectual level, so as to help children understand the surrounding things and environment, and cultivate children's correct attitude towards the surrounding things and environment, so that they reflect love, sympathy, mutual assistance, joy for the success of others, willingness to help others, and other noble moral qualities. For example, in the story of "The Little Goat and the Wolf," the vicious wolf wants to eat the kind little goat. When the little goat sits at the door and cries, the kitten, the puppy, the white horse, and the elephant all sympathize with the little goat and promise to come and help the little goat in the evening. As a result, everyone works together to throw the evil wolf into the river. The plot is simple, the images are vivid, and the content is constantly repeated, making it easy for three- or four-year-old children to understand and remember. Emotionally, it will naturally arouse children's hatred for the brutal wolf, sympathy for the weak goat, and the victorious ending will make them feel happy, arousing a kind of joyful and encouraging emotion, and cultivating children's optimism.

　　Poetry is also loved by children, especially nursery rhymes, which are most easily accepted by them. Because nursery rhymes are short in form, concise in language, rhythmic, and have rhyme, they are easy to read, easy to memorize, so children love nursery rhymes as much as they love music. For example, "I Sing, Who Answers" concretely and vividly teaches children to be familiar with the ten numbers from one to ten, and at the same time makes children recognize ten common flowers and plants. Nursery rhyme is a unique national style of literary form, it can enrich children's language, so as to cultivate children's love for the motherland.

　　Children like to draw, so when choosing reading materials for children, we should pay attention to whether the image of the painting is beautiful and correct. Younger children understand the picture as a real image. Pictures can cultivate their noble thoughts and feelings, and at the same time, pictures are also intuitive materials for children to understand the image of things. Therefore, those roughly made, or excessively exaggerated, to the point of ugly images, should not be shown to children.

　　In order to meet the reading requirements of children, the China Juvenile and Children's Publishing House in Beijing has published a set of "Preschool Children's Literature Series." This series of books is co-edited by many preschool education experts and well-known domestic painters. These books are printed in large format, color fine printing, and the content of the text and pictures are of a certain level.

　　Let us cultivate their love of books from a very young age and choose good reading materials for them!

    给孩子们看什么书
    黄碧云
    家庭教育的内容是多方面的，教育的方法也有多种多样。给孩子们选择适当的读物，也是一种有效教育方法。
    孩子们爱听故事，特别是对年龄较小的孩子，童话最有吸引力。例如，“老虎外婆”、“小羊和狼”、“小兔子乖乖”等等，已经是历代相传、家喻户晓、为每个孩子所熟悉的优美的童话故事了。孩子们对童话故事百听不厌，因为故事中的那些鲜明的人物形象，故事的思想内容和丰富的幻想，使他们幼小的心灵充满着激动的感受。他们与故事中的人物一同快乐，一同难过；他们从“同情”和“厌弃”中，开始认识了“善与恶”、“好与坏”、“勤劳与懒惰”、“勇敢与怯懦”……，从而接受了正面教育。
    三岁到七岁的孩子虽然不识字，可是他们已经懂得爱书了。他们常常津津有味地拿着书翻来翻去地看，指着书中的插图要求大人讲。满足孩子们这种正当的要求，是一件重要的工作。
    究竟该给孩子选择什么样的书呢？年龄小的孩子是要凭着形象、声音和颜色等来思考的，因此图画故事书最适合幼儿的年龄特征。通过图画中的形象能够加深孩子的印象，巩固他们的记忆。但是，那些带有迷信色彩的神怪故事，以及反映腐败思想和残酷恐怖行为的内容的书，都会损害孩子幼小的心灵。至于那些叙述爱情的故事，由于孩子们不能理解，对他们也是没有任何教育价值的。
    在给孩子选择读物的时候，不仅要注意书的思想内容的正确性，还要适合孩子们的思想水平，这样才能帮助孩子认识周围的事物、环境，并且养成孩子对周围事物、环境的正确态度，使他们反映出爱、同情、互助，为他人的成功而愉快、愿意帮助人等等高尚的道德品质。如“小羊和狼”这故事中，凶恶的狼要吃善良的小羊，当小羊坐在门口哭泣的时候，小猫、小狗、白马和大象都同情小羊，答应晚上来帮助小羊，结果大家同心协力把恶狼扔到河里去了。故事情节简单，形象鲜明，内容又不断地反复，三四岁的孩子很容易理解和记住。在感情上自然就会引起孩子对残暴的狼的憎恨，对弱小的羊的同情，以及由于胜利的结局使他们感到愉快，引起一种欢欣鼓舞的情绪，培养了孩子们的乐观精神。
    诗歌也是孩子们所喜爱的，尤其是儿歌最容易为他们所接受。由于儿歌形式短小、语言精炼、有节奏、有音韵，读起来容易上口，容易记忆，因此，孩子喜爱儿歌就像喜爱音乐一样。如“我来唱谁来对”，它具体形象地教孩子熟悉了从一到十这十个数字，同时又使孩子认识了十种常见的花草。儿歌是一种有独特民族风格的文学形式，它能够丰富孩子的语言，从而培养孩子热爱祖国的感情。
    孩子们是喜欢画的，因此在给孩子选择读物的时候应该注意画的形象是否美丽而正确。年龄小的孩子是把图画当作真正的形象来领会的。图画可以培养他们高尚的思想和感情，同时图画也是孩子们认识事物形象的直观材料。因此那些粗制滥造，或过分夸张，以至形象丑陋的图画，是不应该给孩子看的。
    为了适应孩子们阅读的要求，北京中国少年儿童出版社出版了一套“学前儿童文艺丛书”，这套丛书是由许多学前教育专家和国内知名的画家合编的，这些书，是用大开本，彩色精印，文字内容和图画都有一定的水平。
  让我们从孩子很小的时候就培养他们爱书的习惯，给他们选择好的读物吧！
