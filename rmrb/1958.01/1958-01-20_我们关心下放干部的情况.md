    We Are Concerned About the Situation of Downward-Transferred Cadres
    Since the Party and the government put forward the great call that intellectuals and state cadres should engage in physical labor for comprehensive training, many of our colleagues have responded to the call and gone to the countryside. This is an unprecedented and transformative event. Although we are still working in the offices today, we are all well prepared and waiting for the next batch to be approved for downward transfer. Therefore, we are naturally paying close attention to the labor, life, and study of the downward-transferred cadres. We suggest that local newspapers regularly publish news reports and pictures about the model deeds of downward-transferred cadres; we also hope to hear such communications broadcast on the radio; and I suggest that several newsreel short films be made about downward-transferred cadres eating, living, and laboring with the farmers in the countryside.

    我们关心下放干部的情况
    自从党和政府提出知识分子、国家干部应该从事体力劳动进行全面锻炼的伟大号召后，我们有许多一起工作的同志，响应了号召到农村去。这是前所未有、移风易俗的一件大事。今天我们虽然还留在机关里工作，但我们都作好了一切准备，随时等待着下一批能批准自己下放。因此，下放干部的劳动、生活和学习的情形，自然为我们所密切关注。建议各地报纸经常地刊登一些有关下放干部模范事迹的新闻报道和图片；也希望能听到广播电台播一些这样的通讯；我并建议拍摄几部有关下放干部在农村与农民同吃、同住、同劳动等方面的新闻纪录短片。
