Lu'an Promotes "Five Fixes" to Improve Manure Quality

(Our dispatch) Lu'an County, Shanxi Province, with its 315 agricultural cooperatives, in order to strive for a great leap forward in agriculture this year, has launched an unprecedented manure accumulation campaign under the slogan of "No one idle in villages, cooperatives focusing on water and fertilizer, a mighty army building water conservancy, and thousands of carts and ten thousands of loads accumulating fertilizer" since the beginning of winter. From November 1st to December 31st last year, the county accumulated more than 57.2 million dan of various fertilizers, averaging 88 dan per mu, accounting for 88% of the winter-spring fertilizer accumulation plan. Among them, more than 100 agricultural cooperatives in Xihuo, Yincheng and other townships have averaged more than 100 dan of fertilizer per mu. Inspired by the slogan "Let the fertilizer become mountains, let the grain fill the barn", the Wangjialing Agricultural Cooperative has reached 210 dan of fertilizer per mu on all its land.

When carrying out the mass fertilizer accumulation campaign, the county extensively conducted education on "quality first." Therefore, not only was the amount of fertilizer accumulated large, but the quality was also greatly improved compared to the past. The county has universally promoted the "Five Fixes" management method in livestock pens, namely fixing personnel, fixing pens, fixing livestock, fixing tasks, and fixing time, to enhance the sense of responsibility of the feeders and greatly improve the quality of livestock pen fertilizer. The Shengli Cooperative of Yincheng Township implemented a method of classifying livestock and assigning fertilizer quotas monthly. The cooperative classified its 54 livestock into grades. For cows, five head were classified, with monthly fertilizer accumulation quotas of 36 dan for the first grade, 32 dan for the second grade, and 28 dan for the third grade. For donkeys and mules, 35 head were classified, with 28 dan for the first grade, 24 dan for the second grade, and 20 dan for the third grade. For horses, 14 head were classified, with 32 dan for the first grade, 30 dan for the second grade, and 24 dan for the third grade, ensuring the quality of stable manure. The Wangjialing Agricultural Cooperative also greatly improved the quality of fertilizer by mixing the excavated soil and collected dust with night soil before applying it to the land.

    本报讯　山西潞安县三百一十五个农业社，为争取今年农业大跃进，入冬以来，在“村村没闲人、社社抓水肥，千军万马搞水利，千车万担闹积肥”的口号下，掀起了史无前例的积肥运动。从去年11月1日到12月31日全县积各种肥料五千七百二十余万担，每亩平均积肥八十八担，占去冬今春积肥计划的88％。其中西火、荫城等乡一百多个农业社，每亩已平均积肥一百担以上。王家岭农业社在“让肥料成山、让粮食满仓”的口号鼓舞下，全社土地，每亩积肥已达到二百一十担。
    这个县在开展群众性的积肥运动时，广泛地进行了“质量第一”的教育，因此，不但积肥数量多，而且质量也比之以往有很大提高。在畜圈上全县普遍地推广了五定管理法，即定人、定圈、定畜、定任务、定时间，增强饲养员的责任心，大大地提高了畜圈肥料的质量。荫城乡胜利社实行了牲畜分类分等逐月定肥的办法。把全社五十四头牲口分出等级。牛五头，每月积肥一等三十六担，二等三十二担，三等二十八担，驴、骡三十五头，一等二十八担，二等二十四担，三等二十担，马十四头，一等三十二担，二等三十担，三等二十四担，保证了厩肥质量。王家岭农业社，把挖的道土、集的尘土用圊肥拌搅上地，也大大地提高了肥的质量。
