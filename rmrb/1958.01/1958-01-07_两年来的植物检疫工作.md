　　Before liberation, China did not carry out domestic plant quarantine work, and the spread of dangerous diseases, insects, and weeds was very serious. In particular, with the expansion of imperialist colonial forces and the dumping of agricultural products, many diseases and insect pests that seriously harmed crops invaded China. For example, sweet potato internal cork virus was first introduced into Northeast China in 1937 with the Japanese invading army, and later gradually spread to 19 provinces and cities with the promotion of some good sweet potato varieties, becoming a major disaster in sweet potato production. Cotton bollworm, cotton wilt, cotton verticillium wilt, rice stem nematode, broad bean weevil, potato tuber moth, kenaf anthracnose, apple woolly aphid, grape phylloxera, etc., were also introduced into China from abroad or gradually spread in China.

　　After liberation, China strengthened the quarantine of imported and exported agricultural products. From 1953, the foreign trade department implemented quarantine inspection of imported agricultural products. In the same year, the Ministry of Agriculture also began to establish domestic plant quarantine agencies. By 1956, 27 provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions) across the country had established plant quarantine agencies. In 1957, the grassroots plant protection and plant quarantine stations already built in various provinces (autonomous regions) totaled 131. The Ministry of Agriculture and most provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions) have set up plant quarantine laboratories.

　　In the past few years, the Ministry of Agriculture and various provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions) have run many plant quarantine professional training classes, with more than 12,000 people participating in the training.

　　In order to clarify the distribution and damage of various dangerous diseases, insects, and weeds in China, large-scale surveys have been conducted in various places since 1956. Through this survey, the occurrence and distribution of various major dangerous diseases, insects, and weeds have been basically grasped. According to a survey of 17 provinces, 32 kinds of diseases, insects, and weeds that were not recorded locally in the past were found.

　　In order to prevent cotton bollworm from spreading to the cotton-growing areas of Xinjiang, Qinghai, and western Gansu, quarantine inspection and disinfection treatment were carried out on cotton seeds, unginned cotton, and lint transported into this area. According to statistics from Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu and other provinces, more than 10,000 tons of materials were processed.

　　The transportation of seeds and seedlings is the main way for quarantine objects to spread. In the past two years, various provinces have carried out quarantine inspection on various seeds and seedlings that are mutually adjusted and allocated. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1 billion jin of various seeds and more than 33 million seedlings have been inspected.

　　In order to make plant quarantine work penetrate into the masses, more than 11,600 part-time plant quarantine officers have been set up in relevant departments and relevant state-owned farms, production cooperatives, etc. in the past two years.

　　Due to the adoption of these measures, the spread of dangerous diseases, insects, and weeds has been basically controlled in many areas. For example, citrus canker, which is very harmful to citrus, has been basically eliminated in Sichuan and western Hunan; Liaoning, Shandong and other provinces have blocked the areas where apple woolly aphids occur, protecting the vast apple-producing areas where apple woolly aphids do not occur; Shexian County in Hebei Province, Licheng County in Shanxi Province, etc., have taken a series of quarantine, disinfection and other measures when expanding sweet potato planting, avoiding the invasion and harm of sweet potato black rot.

    两年来的植物检疫工作
    我国在解放以前，没有开展国内植物检疫工作，危险病、虫、杂草传播蔓延的情况十分严重。特别是随着帝国主义殖民势力的扩张和农产品的倾销，很多危害农作物严重的病虫害侵入我国。如甘薯里斑病就是1937年随着日本侵略军首先传到我国东北地区，后来又随着某些甘薯优良品种的推广，逐渐扩大蔓延到十九个省市，成为甘薯生产上的主要灾害。棉红铃虫、棉枯萎病、棉黄萎病、水稻干尖线虫、蚕豆象、马铃薯块基蛾、洋麻炭疽病、苹果绵蚜、葡萄根瘤蚜等，也都是由国外传入我国或在国内逐渐扩大蔓延起来的。
    解放以后，我国加强了进、出口农产品的检疫工作。从1953年起，对外贸易部门执行了进口农产品的检疫检验。同年，农业部也开始建立国内植物检疫机构，至1956年，全国已有二十七个省（直辖市、自治区）建立了植物检疫机构，1957年各省（自治区）已建的基层植保植检站共有一百三十一个。农业部和大部分省（直辖市、自治区）都设置了植物检疫实验室。
    几年来农业部和各省（直辖市、自治区）开办了很多植物检疫专业训练班，参加训练的已有一万二千多人。
    为了澄清国内各种危险病虫、杂草的分布和为害情况，从1956年起，各地进行了大规模的调查工作。通过这次调查，基本上掌握了各种主要危险病、虫、杂草的发生分布情况，据十七个省调查，查出了三十二种过去当地没有记载的病、虫、杂草。
    为了防止棉红铃虫传入新疆、青海、甘肃西部棉区，对运入这一地区的棉籽、籽棉、皮棉等都进行了检疫检验和消毒处理。据河北、河南、陕西、甘肃等省统计，处理物资在一万吨以上。
    种籽、苗木的运输是检疫对象传播的主要途径。两年来各省对互相调剂调拨的各种种籽、苗木执行了检疫检验，据不完全统计经过检验的各种种子在十亿斤以上，各种苗木三千三百多万株。
    为使植物检疫工作深入群众，两年来在各有关部门和有关国营农场、生产合作社等设置了兼职植物检疫员一万一千六百多人。
    由于采取了这些措施，很多地区已经基本上控制了危险病、虫、杂草的传播蔓延。如四川和湖南西部已经基本消灭了为害柑桔十分严重的柑桔溃疡病；辽宁、山东等省已经对苹果绵蚜发生地区加以封锁，保护了没有苹果绵蚜发生的广大苹果产区；河北省涉县、山西省黎城等县，在扩大种植甘薯时，采取一系列检疫、消毒等措施，避免了甘薯黑斑病的侵入为害。
