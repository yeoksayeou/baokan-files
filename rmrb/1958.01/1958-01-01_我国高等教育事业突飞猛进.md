Under the correct leadership and care of the Party and the government, in recent years, China's higher education has systematically carried out a series of fundamental reforms and construction work, such as the adjustment of departments, teaching reform, and the ideological remolding of teachers, gradually transforming the old universities into new-type institutions of higher learning serving the socialist construction of the motherland. While reforming, higher education has also developed rapidly. According to statistics from the Ministry of Higher Education, the number of students in universities and colleges across the country now exceeds the number in 1947, the year with the highest number of students before liberation, by nearly two times, totaling more than 440,000. After liberation, the number of university students increased by an average of more than 41,000 each year, which is 13.2 times the average annual increase in the fifty years before liberation; among them, the number of engineering students increased by an average of 20,700 each year, which is 37.3 times the average annual increase in the fifty years before liberation. In these eight years, universities and colleges across the country have trained a total of 369,000 graduates for the country, which is 150,000 more than the total number of university graduates in the fifty years before liberation; at the same time, the quality of students has also improved.

Before liberation, it was difficult for the working people and their children to have access to higher education opportunities. The government gave them preferential treatment with priority admission under the same conditions and set up scholarships for them. In the past eight years, 150,000 worker-peasant cadres, working people, and their children have received higher education.

    Currently, there are more than 30 universities and colleges in Beijing. This is the architectural complex of the capital's cultural and educational district.

    我国高等教育事业突飞猛进
    在党和政府的正确领导和关怀下，这几年来我国高等教育有步骤地进行了院系调整、教学改革、教师思想改造等一系列的根本性的改革和建设工作，逐步地把旧大学改变成为祖国社会主义建设事业服务的新型高等学校。在改革的同时，高等教育事业还有着迅速的发展，据高等教育部统计，现在全国高等学校学生比解放前高等学校学生最多的1947年超过近两倍，共四十四万多人。解放后，高等学校学生平均每年增加四万一千多人，等于解放前五十年中平均每年增加数的十三点二倍；其中工科学生平均每年增加两万零七百人，等于解放前五十年中平均每年增加数的三十七点三倍。这八年中，全国高等学校共为国家培养了三十六万九千名毕业生，比解放前五十年中的高等学校毕业生总数多十五万人；同时学生的质量也有所提高。
    解放前很难有受高等教育机会的劳动人民和他们的子女，政府给予同等条件优先录取的优待，并为他们设置了助学金。八年中，有十五万工农干部、劳动人民和他们的子女受到高等教育。
    目前，北京有三十多所高等学校。这是首都文教区的建筑群。
