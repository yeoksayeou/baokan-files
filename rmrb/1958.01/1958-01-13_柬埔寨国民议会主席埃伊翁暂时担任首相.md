Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 11th: Cambodian King Suramarit today, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, appointed Ek Yi Oun, the speaker of the dissolved National Assembly, as Prime Minister.

The King of Cambodia, on the 8th, dissolved the National Assembly on the advice of the cabinet. General elections will be held within two months. The Cambodian Constitution stipulates that when the National Assembly is dissolved, the current Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior will be replaced, while the remaining cabinet members will remain in office to handle routine matters, and the Speaker of the National Assembly will temporarily assume the duties of Prime Minister.

"Unity Daily" warned today to be wary of interference by imperialist elements. It is essential to recognize that the current situation is tense, which may bring very bad consequences to Cambodia's peace, independence, and neutrality, because some people will not miss this opportunity to muddy the waters.

    柬埔寨国民议会主席
    埃伊翁暂时担任首相
    据新华社金边11日电　柬埔寨国王苏拉玛里特今天按照宪法的规定委任已经解散的国民议会的议长埃伊翁担任首相。
    柬埔寨国王在8日根据内阁的建议解散了国民议会，大选将在两个月之内举行。柬埔寨宪法规定，当国民议会解散时，现任首相和内政大臣将予更换，其余阁员留任处理例行公事，由国民议会议长暂时担负内阁首相职务。
    “统一报”今天警告说，要当心帝国主义分子的干涉。必须认识到目前的局势是紧张的，这可能给柬埔寨的和平、独立和中立带来很坏的结果，因为有些人不会放过这个机会来混水摸鱼。
