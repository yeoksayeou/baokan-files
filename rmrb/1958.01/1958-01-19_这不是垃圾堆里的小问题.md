This Isn't a Small Problem in the Garbage Heap
Li Ying

	The raging wind
  tears apart the smoke from the rooftops,
  and in the garbage bin, the face of coal dust is exposed.
  It opens its stern eyes to shout at you,
  to shout at China:
    Give me life!
    Give me spring!
  Yes, this is not a small problem,
  this is definitely not a trivial incident in the garbage heap!

  Speaking of coal,
  how can we not think of the people in the mines;
      (half of their hearts are in every shovel of coal)
  Speaking of coal,
  how can we not think of the moments of thousands of years ago;
    (it is a part of our land, a part of history)
  And, we have also had difficult times—
  And, we have also had frozen mornings—…
  Without firewood, without tree roots,
  persist,
  after the victory we will have warm houses,
  red-hot stoves…

  My good comrades and thrifty housewives,
  when you dump garbage,
    think about it:
    Have you been worthy of them?
  Our motherland is a tree,
  she must grow taller and bigger,
  the leaves must absorb the most sunlight,
    the roots must absorb the most water;
  Dedicate every drop of water, every grain of soil to the construction of the motherland,
    so that she can provide shade as soon as possible.

  But who is this, who is it,
  throwing out piles of coal,
    and then slamming the door shut?
      (So happy, so cruel!)

  For us, increasing production and practicing economy
    is socialism,
  Pick them back up:
  They still have to make the spindles spin,
  and drive the train wheels full of passengers,
  those ships still have to sail far,
  and the lamps have to shine into the old forest…

  Pick them back up, those lives,
  don't be a sinner of the republic!
  Ask the cleaning worker comrades
  who dump the garbage every night
    to check it,
      to see if you are
        a truly patriotic, loving person!

### 这不是垃圾堆里的小问题

    这不是垃圾堆里的小问题
    李瑛暴躁的风
  撕碎屋顶的炊烟，垃圾箱里露出煤屑的脸，它大睁着严峻的眼睛向你呼喊、向中国呼喊：
    给我生命！给我春天！是的，这不是一个小问题，这绝不是一个不值得一谈的垃级堆里的小事件！提起煤炭，
  怎能不想到矿井的人们；
      （每一铲煤里有一半是他们的心）提起煤炭，
  怎能不想到千百年前的时辰；
    （它是我们土地的一部分，历史的一部分）而且，我们也曾有过艰苦的年代——而且，我们也曾有过冰封的早晨——……没有柴草、没有树根，
  坚持吧，胜利后我们会有温暖的房子、通红的炉子……我的好同志和勤俭持家的主妇们，
  当你们倾倒垃圾的时候，
    想一想：
    可曾对得起它们？我们祖国是一棵树，
  她即要长高长大，
  叶子便要摄取最多的阳光，
    根子便要吸进最多的水分；把一滴水、一粒土都献给建设的祖国，
    好要她早日成荫。可这是谁、是谁呢，把一堆堆煤炭扔出来，
    然后砰的关上了大门？
      （那样快乐、那样残忍！）对于我们，增产加节约
    便是社会主义，把它们拣回来吧：
  它们还要使纱锭旋转，
  还要推动满载旅客的车轮，
  那一艘艘轮船还要远航，
  一盏盏灯要照进老林……拣回来，那些生命，
  不要做共和国的罪人！要每晚倒垃圾的
  清洁工人同志
    来检查吧，
      看你是不是一个
        真正爱国的、爱自己的人！
