    From County to Township to Village, Forming a Network of Amateur Education
    Shanxi's Million Farmers Receive Literacy Certificates

    (Our dispatch) Taiyuan – Shanxi Province's rural literacy work has overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan, initially changing the face of cultural backwardness in rural areas and playing a huge role in promoting agricultural production.

    Shanxi's rural literacy and amateur cultural education work has gradually developed over the past eight or nine years. Currently, over 90% of the province's rural areas have established winter schools or year-round people's schools. Some counties have amateur middle schools, every township has amateur higher primary schools, every village has winter schools or people's schools, and every household has students. A universal amateur education network has been initially formed, and more than 100,000 cadres for literacy work, teachers and counselors for people's schools, and "little teachers" have been trained and developed.

    In recent years, three million illiterate people in the province's rural areas have participated in learning, most of whom have learned three to five hundred characters and can record simple work accounts. 1.08 million farmers have escaped illiteracy and received literacy certificates. The province has overfulfilled the task of enabling more than 865,000 people to escape illiteracy during the First Five-Year Plan. Now, more than 247,000 literacy graduates and farmers with primary school level education have participated in amateur higher primary school classes (groups), of which more than 3,600 have reached higher primary school cultural level, and more than 17,000 have entered amateur junior high schools. Incomplete statistics show that 215 rural villages in the province have basically completed the task of eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people and have become new cultural villages.

    The work of eliminating illiteracy and amateur education for farmers has played an active and huge role in serving socialist construction in rural areas, especially in production construction. First, it has transformed a group of grassroots cadres, party members, Youth League members, and a large number of poor and lower-middle peasants from "blind illiterates" into cultured people. For example, among the 12,600 literacy graduates in Yongji County, there are 600 party members, 1,200 Youth League members, and 2,400 grassroots cadres; of which 7,200 are poor peasants and 3,200 are lower-middle peasants. Poor and lower-middle peasant literacy graduates account for 82.5% of the total. After they mastered the written language, they played a great role in ensuring the implementation of the party's various policies. For example, Qiao Xiyuan, the secretary of the Peijiagou Party Branch in Wutai County, happily said to others: "Before literacy, it was difficult to implement the party's policies even if I wore out my mouth; after literacy, I can read books, newspapers, and documents, and I can also take some simple notes, which has indeed reduced many difficulties in my work." Secondly, literacy work has delivered and cultivated a new batch of talents for the agricultural front. According to a survey of 53,287 literacy graduates in Jinnan Prefecture and six counties including Qi County and Fenyang, 310 of them have left production to take up work, 1,632 have served as main cadres of townships and communes, 3,392 have served as production team leaders of agricultural cooperatives, 400 have served as accountants, 1,787 have served as technicians, 1,420 have served as labor team leaders, 3,430 have served as work recorders, and 1,995 have served as teachers and counselors for people's schools, accounting for 26.95% of the total number of graduates. The proportion is even greater in old mountainous areas. For example, 33% of the literacy graduates in Fanshi County have assumed various positions in rural areas and agricultural cooperatives.

    Because the masses have mastered the written language, libraries and clubs have been universally organized in rural areas, and extensive cultural activities such as reading, reading newspapers, singing, dancing, and performing dramas have been carried out. This not only allows for the dissemination of new cultural and scientific knowledge anytime and anywhere, but also enriches rural cultural life and changes the face of cultural backwardness in rural areas. From the perspective of improving agricultural production technology, overcoming natural disasters, and improving agricultural production, the role of literacy and amateur education is also very significant. According to the information from 72 counties, more than 330,000 people have participated in agricultural technology classes. They have learned how to use pesticides, chemical fertilizers, new agricultural tools, as well as the skills to overcome natural disasters and improve farming techniques. For example, the amateur cultural and technical school of Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Xizhanggeng Township, Jieyu County, after learning agricultural science and technology, 570 people know how to prevent and control wheat diseases and insect pests, 234 people have learned how to soak and mix seeds, 389 people can use and repair sprayers, and 66 young men and women have become agricultural tool operators at the tractor station, and 61 people have learned the installation and repair of diesel engines and locomotive boilers. Because they mastered the technology, they completed the task of eliminating red spiders in cotton fields within ten days, ensuring the increase in wheat production.

    从县到乡从乡到村连成业余教育网
    山西百万农民领到识字证书
    本报讯　山西省农村扫盲工作，超额完成了第一个五年计划，初步改变了农村文化落后的面貌，对发展农业生产起了极大的推动作用。
    山西农村扫盲和业余文化教育工作，八、九年来是逐步发展的。目前，在全省90％以上的农村，建立了冬学或常年民校。部分县里有业余中学，乡乡有业余高小，村村有冬学或民校，家家有学员，一个普遍的业余教育纲已经初步形成，并培养和锻炼了十万余扫盲事业干部、民校教师和辅导员、小先生。
    几年来，全省农村中有三百万文盲先后参加了学习，其中大部分人识到三百至五百个生字，能记简单的工账，有一百零八万农民，摆脱了文盲状态，领到了识字证书。全省超额完成了第一个五年计划期间要求八十六万五千余人摆脱文盲的任务。现在已有二十四万七千多个扫盲毕业学员和具有初小程度的农民，参加了业余高小班（组）学习，其中有三千六百余人已经达到了高小文化程度，并有一万七千余人进了业余初中。全省不完全的统计，已有二百一十五个农村基本上完成了青壮年中的扫盲任务，变成了新的文化村庄。
    扫除文盲和农民业余教育工作，在服务于农村社会主义建设特别是生产建设方面，发挥了积极而巨大的作用。首先是使农村一批基层干部、党团员和大批贫农、下中农的劳动者，从“睁眼瞎子”变成了有文化的人。如永济县一万二千六百名扫盲毕业学员中，党员就有六百人，团员一千二百人，基层干部二千四百人；其中贫农有七千二百人，下中农有三千二百人。贫农、下中农的扫盲毕业学员共占总数的82.5％。他们掌握了文字工具以后，在保证党的各项政策的贯彻执行上，起了很大的作用。如五台县裴家沟党支部书记乔西元高兴地对别人说：“扫盲前磨破嘴也贯彻不好党的政策；扫盲后能看书看报看文件了，还能记些简单的笔记，工作上确实减少了很多困难。”其次，通过扫盲工作给农业战线上输送和培养了一批新的人才。据晋南专区和祁县、汾阳等六县的五万三千二百八十七名扫盲毕业学员中的调查，其中脱产参加工作的三百一十人，担任了乡、社主要干部的一千六百三十二人，农业社生产队长三千三百九十二人，会计四百人，技术员一千七百八十七人，劳动小组长一千四百二十人，记工员三千四百三十人，民校教师、辅导员一千九百九十五人，以上共占毕业总数的26.95％。山地老区的比例更大，如繁峙县扫盲毕业学员中就有33％的人，在农村和农业社中担任了各种不同的职务。
    由于群众掌握了文字工具，农村普遍组织了图书馆和俱乐部，开展了广泛的读书、看报、歌唱、舞蹈和演剧等文化活动，这样，不仅随时随地可以传播新的文化科学知识，而且也丰富了农村文化生活，改变了农村文化落后的面貌。从改进农业生产技术，战胜自然灾害，提高农业生产方面来看，扫盲和业余教育工作的作用也是很大的。据七十二个县的了解，有三十三万余人参加了农业技术班学习。他们学会了使用农药、化学肥料、新式农具，以及战胜自然灾害和改良耕作技术的本领。如解虞县西张耿乡星火农业社业余文化技术学校，经过学习农业科学技术，有五百七十人懂得如何防治小麦病虫害，二百三十四人学会了浸种拌种，三百八十九人能使用和修理喷雾器，六十六名男女青年当了拖拉机站的农具手，六十一人学会柴油机和锅驼机的安装和修理。他们由于掌握了技术，在棉田管理上十天内完成了消灭红蜘蛛的任务，保证了小麦增产。
