An Effective Measure to Realize the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture
Yanbei Decides to Expand the Planting of High-Yield Crops such as Corn

(Our newspaper dispatch) According to the Shanxi Daily, the Yanbei Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed to its subordinate counties to regard appropriately expanding the planting of high-yield crops such as corn and potatoes as an effective measure to realize the Great Leap Forward in agriculture in 1958.

The Yanbei Prefectural Committee has conducted a study of the experiences and lessons learned from expanding high-yield crops in recent years. In 1956, there was a lot of talk about expanding high-yield crops. However, some areas lacked experience and habits in planting corn; water conservancy, fertilizer, and technology did not keep up; and especially due to the special natural conditions of 1956, which were characterized by more rainy days, less sunshine, high humidity, and low temperatures, the maturity period of corn was delayed; thus, corn production decreased in some areas, causing certain losses. However, from an overall perspective, production reduction accounted for only a small proportion; the majority of corn still saw increased production, and even some corn that did not fully mature still yielded no less than other crops; moreover, many areas achieved unprecedented high-yield records due to the planting of high-yield crops. The Hengxing Cooperative in Peicun, Hunyuan, achieved a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of corn on 80 mu of land, and the Yousheng Cooperative in Daiyue Town, Shanyin, achieved a per-mu yield of 1,007 jin of corn on 33 mu of land. The Da and Xiao Shikou Cooperatives in Ying County reached the target of 400 jin per mu as outlined in the Forty-Article Program eleven years ahead of schedule due to the planting of high-yield crops; the 706 mu of corn in Da Shikou Cooperative yielded an average of 608 jin per mu.

However, some comrades lacked a realistic and comprehensive analysis of the achievements and shortcomings of expanding high-yield crops in 1956. As a result, in 1957, there was some wavering in the continuation of expanding high-yield crops, and the planting area of corn was greatly reduced.

During this rectification movement, the Prefectural Committee discovered this problem and, when considering the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, proposed that appropriately expanding the planting of high-yield crops such as corn and potatoes should still be adhered to as an effective measure to increase production. It is required that the corn planting area in 1958 be expanded from 260,000 mu in 1957 to 400,000 mu, with each mu yielding 100 jin more grain than planting other crops under the same land and cultivation conditions; the potato planting area be expanded from 1,200,000 mu in 1957 to 1,400,000 mu, with each mu yielding 80 jin more grain than planting other crops under the same land and cultivation conditions (calculated at four jin of potatoes equivalent to one jin of grain). The above two high-yield crops will be planted on a total of 1.8 million mu, with a planned grain output of 440 million jin. In terms of land, this accounts for only 17% of the total cultivated land in the area; in terms of output, it accounts for more than 36% of the area's planned grain output of 1.2 billion jin in 1958. It is estimated that by 1960, the corn planting area will be expanded to 700,000 mu, and the potato planting area will be expanded to 1.8 million mu, totaling 2.5 million mu (accounting for less than one-quarter of the area's cultivated land), with an output of 800 million jin. This figure is almost equal to the average annual output of 820 million jin during the First Five-Year Plan period. That is to say, in three years, less than a quarter of the cultivated land will be used to produce the entire area's annual grain output during the First Five-Year Plan period. This will fundamentally change the grain shortage situation in the Yanbei area. The Prefectural Committee requires that all counties must take a revolutionary spirit in treating the expansion of high-yield crops as a measure to increase production, persist in it unswervingly, and never give up halfway.

In order to move forward better on the basis of summarizing past experiences and lessons, the Prefectural Committee also put forward ten measures to ensure increased corn production: (1) Select excellent varieties that can both increase production and ensure stable yields and are suitable for local natural conditions; (2) Corn must be planted in suitable waterlogged and good land, but do not encroach on saline-alkali land; (3) Apply at least 3,000 jin of base fertilizer and half a cart of topdressing fertilizer, plus 4 jin of fertilizer powder, and hoe at least three times; (4) According to local natural conditions, the plant spacing of corn should reach about 2.5 chi, and the row spacing should reach about 1.5 chi. The number of plants per mu should not be less than 1,400 and not more than 1,800; (5) Generally implement artificial pollination; (6) Generally intercrop with beans; (7) Counties, townships, and cooperatives should have special personnel responsible for corn; (8) Generally cultivate high-yield corn; (9) Each county should cultivate corn high-yield cooperatives; (10) Cooperatives that grow corn should cultivate corn high-yield teams. Through the above measures, ensure that each mu of corn produces more than 400 jin.

### 实现农业大跃进的一项有效措施  雁北决定扩种玉米等高产作物

    实现农业大跃进的一项有效措施
    雁北决定扩种玉米等高产作物
    本报讯　据山西日报报道：中共雁北地委已向所属各县提出：把适当地扩大高产作物的玉米、马铃薯，作为实现1958年农业大跃进的一项有效措施。
    雁北地委对几年来扩大高产作物的经验教训，曾作过一番研究。1956年，扩大高产作物喊得很响。但是，由于有些地方缺乏种植玉米的经验和习惯；由于水利、肥料、技术等没有赶上去；特别是由于1956年阴雨多、日照少、湿度大、温度低的特殊的自然条件，延迟了玉米的成熟期；因而部分地区的玉米减产了，造成了一定损失。但从全盘的情况看：减产的毕竟只占少数，大部分的玉米仍然增产了，即使一些没有完全成熟的玉米，产量也不比其它作物低；而且有不少地方由于种植了高产作物，出现了当地有史以来空前未有过的高额丰产纪录。浑源裴村恒星社的八十亩玉米亩产千斤，山阴岱岳镇优胜社的三十三亩玉米亩产一千零七斤。应县大、小石口二社，因种植高产作物，提前十一年达到了四十条纲要中亩产四百斤的指标，大石口社的七百零六亩玉米，每亩即平均产到六百零八斤。
    但是，有些同志对1956年扩大高产作物的成绩和缺点缺乏实事求是的全面分析。因而1957年对继续扩大高产作物产生了某种动摇情绪，玉米的种植面积大为减少。
    在这次整风运动中，地委发现了这个问题，在考虑农业大跃进的时候提出：适当地扩大高产作物的玉米、马铃薯，仍应作为一项有效的增产措施坚持下去。要求1958年的玉米种植面积，由1957年的二十六万亩扩大到四十万亩，每亩比在同等土地，同样耕作条件下种植其它作物增产一百斤粮食；马铃薯由1957年的一百二十万亩扩大到一百四十万亩，每亩比在同等土地、同样耕作条件下种植其它作物增产八十斤粮食（以四斤马铃薯折一斤粮食计算）。上述两项高产作物，共种植一百八十万亩，计划产粮四亿四千万斤。从土地看，只占全区耕地的17％；从产量看，即占到全区1958年计划产粮十二亿斤的36％以上。预计到1960年，玉米扩大到七十万亩，马铃薯扩大到一百八十万亩，两项共二百五十万亩（占不到全区耕地面积的四分之一），产量达到八亿斤。这个数字几乎和第一个五年计划期间每年平均产量八亿二千万斤相等。就是说，三年以后要用不到四分之一的耕地，产到第一个五年计划期间全区全年的粮食。从而使雁北区的缺粮状况发生根本的变化。地委要求各县在对待扩大高产作物这一增产措施上，一定要拿出一股革命干劲，百折不挠地坚持下去，决不半途而废。
    为了在总结过去经验教训的基础上更好地前进，地委还提出了保证玉米增产的十项措施：（一）选用既能增产，又能保收的适合于本地自然条件的优良品种；（二）一定要把玉米种在适合生长的水地、好地，但不要侵占白麻地；（三）底肥至少施三千斤，追肥半车，附加四斤肥田粉，并要普遍锄到三次以上；（四）根据本地自然情况，玉米的株距应达到二点五尺左右，行距达到一点五尺左右。每亩的株数稀不少于一千四，稠不多于一千八；（五）普遍实行人工授粉；（六）普遍间作豆子；（七）县乡社应有专人分工负责玉米；（八）普遍培养高额丰产玉米；（九）各县要培养出玉米丰产社；（十）种玉米的社要培养出玉米丰产队。通过上述措施，保证每亩玉米都产四百斤以上。
