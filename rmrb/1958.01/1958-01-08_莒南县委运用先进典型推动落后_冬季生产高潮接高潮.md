Ju'nan County Committee Uses Advanced Models to Promote Backwardness: Winter Production Tide Follows Tide

(Reported by this newspaper) Shandong Ju'nan County, using the leadership method of "grasping both ends and bringing along the middle," is pushing the current winter production movement from one upsurge to a new one. Nearly a thousand agricultural cooperatives in the county have launched an upsurge in learning from the advanced and creating advanced models; about half of the cooperatives are determined to catch up with and surpass the magnificent undertaking of the Da Shan Agricultural Cooperative in building mountainous areas and developing mountainous area production.

Last year, the county suffered severe floods, droughts, and wind disasters, resulting in a reduction of approximately 50 million jin of grain compared to 1956. However, the county committee, taking the Da Shan Cooperative, the Ri Guang Cooperative, and the North Red Star Cooperative's comprehensive efforts in soil and water conservation and changing the face of mountainous areas as examples in mountainous and hilly regions, and the West Red Star Cooperative and the South Red Star Cooperative's efforts in draining water and digging wells as examples in plains and low-lying areas, held four training classes in a row before winter production. They adopted the method of combining visits and training to train more than 10,000 cadres above the level of production team leader and activists among cooperative members. District and township leaders also adopted the same method, adapting to local conditions, learning from advanced experiences, and criticizing conservative thinking, which quickly set off a high tide in the winter production movement.

Based on the characteristic of uneven development of the production upsurge, leaders at all levels then focused on grasping the backward end. They first helped third-category cooperatives create advanced models and set up examples. When Lingquan District focused on the backward Zhuan Ding Township, they started with a small team in Wangjia Village, led by village party secretary Wang Wenming, and first created a piece of ditch-ridged farmland. Within three days, the entire village quickly took action and transformed 230 mu of waterlogged land. After the cadres of the entire township visited Wangjia Village's production, a production upsurge formed in the entire township within five days, quickly jumping from a backward township to a relatively outstanding advanced township in the county. Due to the strong influence of Zhuan Ding Township's actions in winter production, the enthusiasm of all agricultural cooperatives in the district for winter production became increasingly high. The production movement throughout the county has thus developed wave upon wave. Of the county's original 219 third-category cooperatives, all but three have, from the perspective of production actions, jumped to become first-category and second-category cooperatives.

In order to enable the backward to catch up with and surpass the advanced, and to promote the advanced to become even more advanced, in addition to organizing more than 50,000 people countless times to visit and evaluate typical cooperatives, county and district leaders have also used methods such as learning from experienced places and holding field meetings to strengthen leadership. Some townships and cooperatives that were originally relatively backward have played a significant role in promoting advanced and intermediate cooperatives due to their rapid progress in winter production. At present, the enthusiasm of various agricultural cooperatives for not wanting to fall behind in production is very high, with people and red flags everywhere, and lights everywhere at night.

    莒南县委运用先进典型推动落后
    冬季生产高潮接高潮
    本报讯　山东莒南县以“抓两头、带中间”的领导方法，把当前的冬季生产运动从高潮推向新的高潮。全县近千个农业社已掀起学习先进、创造先进的热潮；约有半数的社决心要赶上和超过大山农业社建设山区、发展山区生产的壮举。
    去年，这个县曾遭遇了特大的水旱灾害和风灾，比1956年减产粮食约五千万斤。但县委在山区和丘陵地区以大山社、日光社、北红星社全面保持水土，改变山区面貌为榜样，在平原和涝洼地区以西红星社和南红星社排涝打井为榜样，在冬季生产前，连续举办了四期训练班，采取边参观边训练的方法，训练了一万多名生产队长以上干部和社员积极分子。区乡领导亦因地制宜地采取同样办法，学习先进经验，批判保守思想，使冬季生产运动很快掀起了高潮。
    根据生产高潮开展不够平衡的特点，各级领导紧接着抓起了落后的一头。他们首先帮助三类社搞出先进的样子，树立榜样。岭泉区在抓落后的专町乡时，首先从王家庄一个小队开始，由村支书王文明领导，首先搞出了一块沟洫畦田。三天内全村很快行动起来，改造了二百三十亩涝洼地。全乡干部参观了王家庄的生产以后，五天内全乡也形成了生产高潮，很快由落后乡跃进为全县比较突出的先进乡。由于专町乡在冬季生产行动上的强烈影响，全区各农业社冬季生产的劲头，越来越大了。全县范围内的生产运动，就是这样一个浪潮又一个浪潮地向前发展。全县原有的二百一十九个三类社，除了三个社以外，从生产行动来看，都已经跃进为一类社和二类社。
    为了使后进的赶上和超过先进，推动先进更加先进，县区领导除已组织过五万余人，无数次地参观与评比了典型社外，并运用了那里有经验，就到那里去学习与开地头会等办法来加强领导。一些原来是较为落后的乡和社，由于他们在冬季生产中飞跃前进，对先进社和中间状况的社起了很大的推动作用。目前，各个农业社不甘心落后的生产劲头很高，满山遍野是人群和红旗，入晚到处是灯火。
