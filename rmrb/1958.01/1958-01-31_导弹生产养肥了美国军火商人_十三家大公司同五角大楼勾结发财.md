Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 30th: American newspapers have published materials exposing how American monopoly capitalist organizations are getting rich by producing rockets and missiles, and pointed out the intricate relationship between these organizations and the Pentagon.

According to a recent issue of "The Nation" magazine, a representative of a large corporation engaged in rocket and missile production said, "When Congress is in session, his colleagues will be competing to be the first to propose a bill to increase appropriations for missiles and aircraft" because they derive huge profits from the production of missiles and aircraft.

This person's statement has now been confirmed by some facts. Many members of Congress and government officials have recently been clamoring for the allocation of large sums of money to develop missiles and rockets. For example, Democratic Senator Jackson even demanded that the funding for missile development be increased by another $2 billion on top of the current $5.3 billion.

According to "The Nation," the major corporations currently engaged in missile and rocket production in the United States are thirteen in number. They are "Bell Telephone Company," "Boeing Aircraft Company," "Curtiss-Wright Corporation," "Douglas Aircraft Company," "General Dynamics Corporation" ("Convair Aircraft Company"), "Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation," "Lockheed Aircraft Corporation," "Martin Company," "McDonnell Aircraft Corporation," "North American Aviation," "Northrop Corporation," "Republic Aviation Corporation," and "United Aircraft Corporation." The main source of these companies' orders and profits is government military procurement. For example, six of the thirteen companies – "Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation," "McDonnell Aircraft Corporation," "Martin Company," "North American Aviation," "Northrop Corporation," and "Republic Aviation Corporation" – are actually producing 100% for military orders. For the other large companies, 60% to 95% of their production is also military orders.

These thirteen companies are mainly controlled by several large American financial groups. The "Martin Company," which manufactures the "Vanguard" rocket and "Titan" missile, is backed by the Rockefeller and Mellon families. "Douglas Aircraft Company," which manufactures the "Thor" intermediate-range missile, is related to the Giannini financial group in California. "Convair Aircraft Company," which manufactures the "Atlas" intercontinental ballistic missile, is controlled by Lehman Brothers in New York and is connected to the Morgan financial group. In addition to directly controlling "Bell Telephone Company," the Morgan family also controls "Chrysler Corporation," which produces the "Jupiter" and "Redstone" missiles.

As for profits, according to the materials of the Aircraft Industries Association, in 1956, these thirteen companies earned a total net profit of $156 million after taxes, a fourfold increase compared to the Korean War period in 1951. As the U.S. government has recently decided to greatly increase spending on rockets and missiles, these companies' orders and profits will also increase further. For example, "Martin Company" recently received a military order worth $358 million.

These companies have close ties with the Department of Defense. Deputy Secretary of Defense Quarles was previously the director of the "Bell Telephone Company" research institute. Secretary of Defense McElroy was previously a director of "General Electric Company" and "Chrysler Corporation," both controlled by Morgan, and immediately after taking office, he gave the order to manufacture the "Jupiter" intermediate-range missile to "Chrysler Corporation." At the same time, many retired senior military officers also hold important positions in the thirteen major corporations.

### 导弹生产养肥了美国军火商人  十三家大公司同五角大楼勾结发财

    导弹生产养肥了美国军火商人
    十三家大公司同五角大楼勾结发财
    据新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国报刊刊载的一些材料揭发了美国垄断资本组织通过生产火箭和导弹而发财致富的情况，并且指出了这些组织同五角大楼之间千丝万缕的关系。
    据最近一期的“民族”周刊报道，最近有一个从事火箭导弹生产的大公司的代表说，“当国会开会的时候，他的同行们将争先恐后地争取第一个提出关于增加对导弹和飞机的拨款的法案”，因为从导弹和飞机的生产中，他们取得了庞大的利润。
    这个人的说法现在已经由一些事实而得到证实。许多国会议员和政府官员最近都叫嚷必须拨出大笔款项来发展导弹和火箭。例如民主党参议员杰克逊甚至要求发展导弹的经费在目前的五十三亿美元之外再增加二十亿美元。
    据“民族”周刊说，美国目前从事导弹和火箭生产的大公司主要有十三家，它们是“贝尔电话公司”，“波音飞机公司”，“蔲蒂斯—赖特公司”，“道格拉斯飞机公司”，“通用动力公司”（“康瓦尔飞机公司”），“格鲁门飞机发动机公司”，“洛克希德飞机公司”，“马丁公司”，“麦克唐纳公司”，“北美公司”，“诺斯罗普公司”，“共和公司”和“联合飞机公司”。这些公司的订货和利润的主要来源是政府的军事订货。例如，十三家公司中有六家——“格鲁门飞机发动机公司”、“麦克唐纳公司”、“马丁公司”、“北美公司”、“诺斯罗普公司”、“共和公司”——实际上是100％为军事定货而生产的。其他大公司也有60％到95％的生产是军事订货。
    这十三家公司主要由美国几个大财团掌握着。制造“先锋号”火箭和“大力神”式导弹的“马丁公司”的后台老板是洛克菲勒和梅隆家族。制造“雷神”式中程导弹的“道格拉斯飞机公司”同加利福尼亚州的基安尼尼财团有关系。制造“阿特拉斯”式洲际导弹的“康瓦尔飞机公司”由纽约利曼银行控制，并且同摩根财团有联系。摩根家族除了直接控制“贝尔电话公司”以外，还操纵着生产“丘辟特”和“红石”式导弹的“克莱斯勒公司”。
    至于利润方面，据航空公司联合会的材料，1956年这十三家公司扣除税款以外，一共获得净利一亿五千六百万美元，比1951年朝鲜战争时期增加四倍。由于美国政府最近决定把用在火箭和导弹方面的开支大大增加，因此这些公司的订货和利润也将要进一步增加。例如“马丁公司”最近接到的一笔军事订货就达三亿五千八百万美元。
    这些公司同国防部有着密切的关系。国防部副部长卡利斯以前是“贝尔电话公司”研究所的所长。国防部长麦克艾罗伊以前是摩根控制的“通用电气公司”和“克莱斯勒公司”的董事，他上任后就立即把制造“丘辟特”中程导弹的订货交给了“克莱斯勒公司”。同时，许多退职的高级军官也在十三家大公司中担任要职。
