    Promoting New Agricultural Tools, Advancing Technological Reform
    1.4 Million New Agricultural Tools to Support Agricultural Production This Year
    (Our dispatch) This year, the nation will continue to promote 1.4 million units of new agricultural tools such as double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows, seeders, and harvesters to support the great leap forward in agricultural production.
    With the development and consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, farmers are urgently demanding the use of new agricultural tools to improve productivity and increase agricultural production. From 1954 to the end of 1956, the Handan Special District of Hebei Province promoted more than 20,600 double-wheeled double furrow plows. In 1957, this special district originally planned to promote 4,500 double furrow plows. However, during the autumn plowing season, many agricultural cooperatives requested to purchase them. In addition to selling all 4,800 units in stock, another 3,900 units were transferred in. By early November, more than 6,000 units had been sold, and by December, there was a shortage.
    Since the National Farmland Irrigation Machinery and Agricultural Mechanization Conference last December, the enthusiasm for promoting new agricultural tools has increased even further in various regions. Hubei Province convened a provincial representative meeting of advanced agricultural tool producers to summarize and exchange experiences in improving old agricultural tools and promoting new agricultural tools. Tianmen County in Hubei Province improved and created 26 types of agricultural tools, totaling more than 70,000 pieces, and promoted seven types of new agricultural tools, totaling more than 19,000 pieces, saving more than 820,000 labor days. Crops cultivated using new agricultural tools yielded 33.7% more than those cultivated using old agricultural tools. Liaoning Province convened a provincial agricultural tool work conference, focusing on examining and criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking in agricultural tool work and the erroneous idea that new agricultural tools were already saturated. Based on the needs of farmers and the actual needs of agricultural production, the conference increased the 1958 agricultural tool promotion plan. After investigation and comprehensive planning, Zhejiang Province determined that, with the exception of mountainous areas, terraced fields, muddy fields, and areas lacking draught cattle, approximately 15 million mu of land in the province could be cultivated using double furrow plows. During the second five-year plan, Zhejiang Province plans to reclaim 1.5 million mu of coastal land (i.e., coastal alluvial land), which will also require the use of double furrow plows. Therefore, in addition to taking active measures this spring to put all the more than 30,000 double furrow plows that have already been promoted into spring plowing production, Zhejiang Province plans to continue promoting them in the autumn of this year and in 1959 and 1960. It is estimated that by 1962, a total of 150,000 double furrow plows will have been promoted throughout the province, covering 15 million mu of cultivated land, accounting for 45% of the province's existing cultivated land area, ensuring that all areas capable of using double furrow plows will use this new type of plow.
    According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, farmers in various regions have requested to purchase more than 60 types of new agricultural tools, totaling more than 8 million pieces. During the second five-year plan, the state has decided to continue to promote existing new agricultural tools in large quantities and will also design more new varieties and models of agricultural tools based on the needs of agricultural production in various regions to meet the needs of agricultural production.
    During the first five-year plan, the promotion of new agricultural tools achieved great success. By the end of 1957, more than 4.68 million pieces of new agricultural tools had been promoted nationwide, an increase of 13.4 times compared to 1952. Among them, more than 1.62 million double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows were promoted, an increase of more than 700 times compared to 1952. In 1957, the area cultivated with double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows and other new types of plows reached more than 200 million mu, accounting for 12% of the country's total cultivated land area.
    With the promotion of new agricultural tools, more than 100,000 agricultural tool cadres and more than 3 million farmer agricultural tool technicians have been trained in various regions in recent years. A total of more than 47,400 agricultural tool repair stations (groups) have been established nationwide, with 150,000 repair workers.
    Due to the good cultivation quality of new agricultural tools, crops in both dry and paddy fields have significantly increased in yield in the areas where they have been promoted and used. Shandong Province conducted wheat yield comparison tests in 27 agricultural cooperatives and farms. Under the same conditions of soil quality, fertilizer, seeds, and field management, fields cultivated using double furrow plows yielded an average of 22.2% more than those cultivated using old plows. Hebei Province conducted crop yield comparison tests on corn, cotton, and other crops at 13 locations in six counties (Nangong, Daming, Changli, Lincheng, Xuanhua, and Cheng'an). Under the same conditions, those cultivated using double furrow plows yielded 9.2% to 17.9% more than those cultivated using old plows. Zhejiang Province conducted rice yield comparison tests using double furrow plows and wooden plows at 18 locations. Those cultivated using double furrow plows yielded an average of more than 14% more. According to a 1956 survey in 27 counties in Heilongjiang Province, wheat cultivated using new agricultural tools yielded 20% to 30% more than that cultivated using old agricultural tools, soybeans yielded 20% more, sorghum and millet yielded 15% to 20% more, and corn yielded 10% more. According to new and old agricultural tool yield comparison tests in 24 provinces (regions), 14 crops, including rice, wheat, cotton, sorghum, corn, millet, soybeans, flax, sugar beets, peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, sweet potatoes, and potatoes, showed varying degrees of yield increase.
    Another advantage of new agricultural tools is that they save labor and increase efficiency, enabling crops to be cultivated in a timely manner and reducing the difficulty of labor and animal power shortages during the busy farming season. The May 1st Agricultural Cooperative in Dianlong Township, Xundian Hui Autonomous County, Yunnan Province, has 37 double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows, 25 walking plows, 12 threshers, and 13 single-furrow plows without wheels. Last year, all of them were put into use, not only overcoming the labor shortage but also saving tens of thousands of labor days.
    In addition, new agricultural tools are the collective property of agricultural cooperatives and are the material basis for consolidating agricultural cooperatives. Agricultural cooperation has opened up the broadest path for the development of agricultural productivity, and the large-scale promotion of new agricultural tools is a major measure to rapidly develop productivity on this broadest path. The Bao'an Agricultural Cooperative in Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province, began using new agricultural tools in 1951. Coupled with other important measures, the result was increased production every year. The average yield per hectare in 1951 was 2,640 jin, reaching 3,900 jin in 1956, an increase of 47.7% compared to 1951. This shows that the change in production relations has led to the rapid development of productivity, and the development of productivity has in turn consolidated the new production relations. Article 7 of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), which stipulates the improvement of old agricultural tools and the promotion of new agricultural tools, is one of the important measures to achieve grain and cotton production targets. Therefore, while carrying out water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns, we must strengthen agricultural tool work to meet the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production.

    推广新式农具　促进技术改革
    今年将有一百四十万部新式农具支援农业生产
    本报讯　今年全国将继续推广双轮双（单）铧犁、播种机、收割机等新式农具一百四十万部，支援农业生产大跃进。
    随着农业生产合作社的发展和巩固，农民迫切要求使用新式农具以提高生产力，增加农业生产。河北省邯郸专区从1954年开始到1956年底，共推广双轮双铧犁二万零六百多部。这个专区1957年原计划推广四千五百部双铧犁，秋耕时由于很多农业社要求购买，除将库存四千八百部全数出售外，还调进三千九百部，到11月上旬即已销出六千多部，12月份又出现脱销局面。
    去年12月全国农田排灌机械及农业机械化会议以后，各地推广新式农具的劲头更大了。湖北省召开了全省农具先进生产者代表大会，总结交流了改良旧式农具和推广新式农具的经验。湖北省天门县改良和创造农具二十六种，计七万多件，推广新式农具七种，计一万九千多件，节省人工八十二万多个。使用新式农具耕种的农作物比使用旧式农具的增产33.7％。辽宁省召开了全省农具工作会议，着重检查和批判了在农具工作中的右倾保守思想和认为新式农具已经饱和的错误思想。会议根据农民的要求和农业生产的实际需要，增加了1958年农具推广计划。浙江省经过调查研究和全面规划，全省除山区、梯田、烂泥田和耕牛缺乏的地区以外，其余约有一千五百多万亩的田地都可以使用双铧犁。在第二个五年计划期间，浙江省计划开垦海涂
  （即海滨冲积地）一百五十万亩，也需要使用双铧犁。因此，浙江省除了在今年春季采取积极措施，将已推广的三万多部双铧犁全部投入春耕生产外，并计划在今年秋季和1959年、1960年继续推广。预计到1962年，全省共将推广双铧犁十五万部，负担耕地一千五百万亩，占全省现有耕地面积的45％，做到能够使用双铧犁的地区全部使用这种新式犁耕地。
    据农业部初步统计，各地农民要求购买的新式农具共有六十多种、八百万件以上。在第二个五年计划期间，国家决定除继续大量推广现有的各种新式农具外，还将根据各地农业生产的需要，设计更多的新品种新型号的农具，以满足农业生产的需要。
    在第一个五年计划期间，新式农具的推广工作，已经获得了巨大成绩。到1957年末，全国共推广新式农具四百六十八万多件，较1952年增加了十三点四倍。其中推广双轮双（单）铧犁一百六十二万多部，较1952年增加了七百多倍。1957年使用双轮双（单）铧犁和其他新式犁耕地的面积达到两亿多亩，占全国总耕地面积的12％。
    随着新式农具的推广，几年来各地共训练农具干部十万多人，农民农具手三百多万。全国共建立农具修配站（组）四万七千四百多个，拥有修配工人十五万人。
    由于新式农具耕作质量好，在推广使用的地区，不论旱地或水田，农作物都显著增产。山东省在二十七个农业社和农场作了小麦产量对比试验，在同样的土质、肥料、种子和田间管理等条件下，使用双铧犁耕种的田比使用旧犁的平均增产22.2％。河北省在南宫、大名、昌黎、临城、宣化、成安六个县十三个点上进行了玉米、棉花等作物产量对比试验，在同样条件下，使用双铧犁耕种的比使用旧犁的增产9.2％到17.9％。浙江省在十八个点上用双铧犁和木犁进行了水稻产量对比试验，使用双铧犁耕种的平均增产14％以上。黑龙江省1956年在二十七个县的调查，使用新式农具耕种的小麦比用旧式农具耕种的增产20％到30％，大豆增产20％，高粱、谷子增产15％到20％，玉米增产10％。据二十四个省（区）新、旧农具产量对比试验，水稻、小麦、棉花、高粱、玉米、谷子、大豆、亚麻、甜菜、花生、芝麻、油菜籽、红薯、马铃薯等十四种作物，都有不同程度的增产。
    新式农具的另一优点是省工出活，使农作物能够及时耕种，减少农忙时劳力和畜力不足的困难。云南省寻甸回族自治县甸龙乡五一农业社，有双轮双（单）铧犁三十七部、步犁二十五部、打谷机十二部、无轮一铧犁十三部，去年全都使用起来，不仅克服了劳力不足的困难，还节省了几万个劳动日。
    此外，新式农具是农业社的公有财产，是巩固农业社的物质基础。农业合作化给农业生产力的发展开辟了最广阔的道路，新式农具的大量推广，正是在这条最广阔的道路上迅速发展生产力的重大措施。黑龙江省集贤县保安农业社，从1951年起开始使用新式农具，再加上其他的重要措施，结果年年增产。1951年平均每公顷产量二千六百四十斤，1956年达到三千九百斤，比1951年增加了47.7％。这说明生产关系的改变，使生产力得到迅速的发展；生产力的发展，又反转来巩固了新的生产关系。农业发展纲要（修正草案）第七条改良旧式农具推广新式农具的规定，是实现粮棉生产指标的重要措施之一。因此，在兴修水利和积肥运动的同时，必须加强农具工作，以适应农业生产大跃进的需要。
