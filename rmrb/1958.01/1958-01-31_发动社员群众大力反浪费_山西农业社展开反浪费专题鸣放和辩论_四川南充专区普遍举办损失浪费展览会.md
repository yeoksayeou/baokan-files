Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th -- Recently, many agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province have launched special "Letting Go and Airing Views" and debates centered on opposing waste, to further implement the principle of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives. In agricultural cooperatives where the debates have already concluded, members have formulated "Love the Cooperative Pledges" and "Frugal Household Management Pledges." Many cooperatives have further formulated systems to block loopholes for waste.

Of the more than two thousand six hundred and sixty agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province that have completed rectification work, most have rectified their financial management work, announced uncleared accounts from previous years, and formulated financial revenue and expenditure plans and some new management systems. Appropriate action has also been taken against a small number of cooperative cadres and members who have committed embezzlement, theft, misappropriation of public funds and grain, etc. To further implement the principle of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives, the agricultural cooperatives mobilized members to continue "Letting Go and Airing Views" to thoroughly expose waste phenomena. Members of one hundred and ninety-three cooperatives in nine counties, including Taigu and Yu counties, raised 140,000 opinions. Many agricultural cooperatives, in response to the problems revealed by the masses, launched debates among all members and immediately made improvements. Xiong Huo Agricultural Cooperative in Hongzhao County, in the special "Letting Go and Airing Views" debate, found more than ten instances of waste loopholes in finance, safekeeping, and sideline production. Finally, at the members' representative meeting, they discussed ways to plug these loopholes, and according to the meeting's decisions, launched work such as cleaning up old accounts, checking materials, and carrying out safekeeping numbering and registration. Finally, the entire cooperative formulated four systems, including "Material Consumption Quotas" and "Daily Clearing of Accounts and Monthly Settlement for Timely Announcement." In some large agricultural cooperatives, the management structure was also streamlined, cadre subsidy expenses were reduced, and specific measures for agricultural cooperative cadres to participate in labor were stipulated.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchong, 29th -- More than nineteen thousand agricultural cooperatives in Nanchong Prefecture, Sichuan Province, universally held loss and waste exhibitions during rectification, mobilizing the masses of commune members to solve many long-standing problems in operation and management.

Before holding the exhibitions, the agricultural cooperatives, based on the revelations of the members, inspected production and operation management work, collected materials, and calculated the loss and waste accounts. The content of the exhibitions included real objects such as underfed cattle, moldy grain, damaged farm tools, and rotten firewood; charts recording losses such as the death of pigs and cattle due to poor management and reduced grain production; and cartoons about undesirable phenomena such as hiding yields, not cherishing public property, and not obeying dispatch.

The loss and waste phenomena revealed by the exhibitions universally attracted the attention of commune members. According to statistics from twenty-five agricultural cooperatives in Wusheng, Langzhong and other counties, losses and waste amounted to more than 20,000 yuan. Members were greatly surprised after visiting the exhibitions. In the past, many cooperative cadres and members were indifferent to undesirable phenomena such as damage to farm tools and cattle, but now they have changed. They said: If this continues, the grain increased by the cooperative will not be enough to offset everyone's waste. Some said: In the past, we only saw the shortcomings of the cadres, but it turns out we have many shortcomings ourselves. In the early stage of rectification of the First Cooperative of Wang'e Township in Langzhong County, some cooperative cadres and members believed that there was not much room for improvement in the cooperative. After seeing at the exhibition that the cooperative lost more than 600 yuan in cattle, farm tools, etc., averaging more than 7 yuan per household, they all changed their attitudes and actively exposed other losses and waste phenomena in the cooperative, and put forward sixty-two rationalization proposals in production, finance, and other aspects. In Wusheng County, commune members from more than 1,000 cooperatives launched a mass movement of "investigating problems, finding reasons, investigating responsibilities, and thinking of solutions" during the exhibition, thoroughly exposing various problems in the cooperative, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Many members consciously examined their erroneous thoughts and behaviors, such as concealing production and privately distributing it, secretly taking cooperative property, one-sidedly demanding more grain distribution, and being unwilling to increase the retention of public accumulation funds. Each cooperative also thoroughly cleaned up the accounts and internal property. Originally, there were two hundred and sixty-nine cooperatives in Langzhong County with chaotic finances and unclear work point accounts; two hundred and ninety cooperatives with poor management of cattle, farm tools, etc., and unsound systems; and three hundred and sixty-two cooperatives with chaotic labor dispatch and rough workmanship. Now, after exposure, inspection, and full discussion, these cooperatives have universally formulated improvement measures and covenants for abiding by the system. Among them, 85% of the cooperatives have clarified their financial accounts and improved the system; 94% of the cooperatives have made work arrangements and improved the quality of agricultural work. Commune members in many agricultural cooperatives in Yingshan, Guang'an and other counties have also formulated cooperative covenants including cherishing cattle and farm tools, obeying dispatch, and actively working.

    发动社员群众大力反浪费
    山西农业社展开反浪费专题鸣放和辩论
    四川南充专区普遍举办损失浪费展览会
    新华社太原29日电　最近山西省许多农业社展开了以反对浪费为中心内容的专题鸣放和辩论，进一步贯彻勤俭办社方针。辩论已经结束的农业社，社员们都制定了“爱社公约”和“勤俭持家公约”。许多社进一步制定了堵闭浪费漏洞的制度。
    山西省二千六百六十多个已经结束整顿工作的农业社，大部分都整顿了财务管理工作，公布了历年未清的账目，制订了财务收支计划和一些新的管理制度。对少数犯有贪污、偷窃、挪用公款和粮食等的社干部和社员，也作了适当处理。为了进一步贯彻勤俭办社方针，各农业社发动社员继续鸣放，彻底揭发浪费现象。太谷、盂县等九个县一百九十三个社的社员提出了十四万条意见。许多农业社针对群众揭发出来的问题，在全体社员中展开辩论后立即改进。洪赵县雄火农业社，在专题鸣放辩论中，找出财务、保管和副业生产等方面存在的浪费漏洞就有十多处，最后在社员代表会议上讨论了堵塞这些漏洞的办法，并根据会议决定展开了清理旧账、查对物资和进行保管编号登记等工作。最后全社制订出“物资消耗定额”和账目日清月结按时公布”等四项制度。在一些大型的农业社里，还精简了管理机构，缩减了干部补贴费开支，规定了农业社干部参加劳动的具体办法。
    新华社南充29日电　四川省南充专区一万九千多个农业社，在整改中普遍举办损失、浪费展览会，发动社员群众解决经营管理中许多长期未能解决的问题。
    举办展览会前，各农业社根据社员们的揭发，检查了生产和经营管理工作，搜集材料，算出了损失浪费账。展览的内容，有喂瘦的耕牛、霉烂的粮食、损坏的农具、腐烂的柴草等实物；记载着猪牛因管理不善而死亡和粮食减产等损失账的图表；以及关于社里隐瞒产量、不爱护公物、不服从调配等不良现象的漫画。
    展览会揭露出的损失浪费现象，普遍引起社员的注意。据武胜、阆中等县二十五个农业社统计，损失浪费达两万元以上。社员们参观后都大吃一惊。过去，许多社干部、社员对损伤农具、耕牛等不良现象不闻不问，现在改变了。他们说：这样下去，社里增产的粮食还抵不上大家的浪费。有的说：以前只看见干部的缺点，原来我们自己的缺点也很多。阆中县望垩乡第一社整改初期，有些社干、社员认为社里没有多少可改进的地方，在展览会上看到全社损失耕牛、农具等达六百多元，每户平均七元多后，都改变态度，积极起来揭发社里其他损失、浪费现象，并在生产、财务等方面提出了六十二件合理化建议。武胜县一千多个社的社员在举办展览中展开“查问题、找原因、查责任、想办法”的群众性运动，彻底揭发社里各种问题，开展批评与自我批评。许多社员自觉地检查了瞒产私分、暗拿社里财物、片面要求多分粮食、不愿增留公积金等错误的思想行为，各社并将账目和社内财产进行了彻底清理。阆中县原有二百六十九个社财务混乱、工分账目不清；二百九十个社耕牛、农具等使用管理不好、制度不健全；三百六十二个社调工混乱、干活质量粗糙。现在经过揭发、检查和充分讨论，这些社已普遍订出改进办法，订出遵守制度的公约。其中有85％的社查清了财务账目，健全了制度；94％的社作好工作安排，提高了农活质量。营山、广安等县许多农业社社员还订出包括爱护耕牛、农具、服从调配、积极劳动等内容的爱社公约。
