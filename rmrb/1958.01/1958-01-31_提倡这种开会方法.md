    Advocate This Meeting Method
    Chen Zhiyan
    In our daily work, meetings are an indispensable part. We need meetings to summarize work, deploy work, study problems, and solve problems. However, how to make meetings successful and effective is very particular.
    Meetings can be held in conference rooms, for long periods, with lots of talking. Meetings can also be held in factories and villages, with participants visiting and discussing simultaneously. Hubei Province recently adopted the latter meeting method. They call it a "现场会议" [xiànchǎng huìyì] (on-site meeting). The purpose is to promote advanced experiences, letting everyone see with their own eyes first, and then discuss while observing, so that the impression is profound and the effect is very good.
    This generates a feeling.
    In recent years, in some central cities, large and small meetings have been held almost from the beginning to the end of the year. Hundreds and thousands of people travel from all over to these central cities to attend meetings. It can be said that they are busy with meetings. Various departments, in order to hold meetings, have built new hostels and auditoriums. For a while, for the sake of holding meetings, they also specifically put on operas and held banquets. Then they had to prepare a group of people specifically to serve the meetings. Of course, some meetings must be held in the capital and provincial capitals, such as the National and Provincial/Municipal People's Congresses, as well as other national and provincial meetings. But not all meetings must be held and must be held in big cities. If some meetings to solve problems in work are moved to places closer to the masses and closer to reality, it will be more economical, more practical, and the effect will definitely be much better. Can this be done? The answer is please look at the on-site meetings in Hubei Province. They have already done it this way, and they have done it very well. This is the first feeling.
    Every meeting must have speeches, and every speech must have a summary. But how to make the speech substantive and the conclusion reasonable is not well resolved in every meeting. Some meetings are very long, with a lot of talk, but they are not necessarily practical and solve problems. However, on-site meetings can avoid this problem. They involve seeing and talking at the same time. With vivid things around, the speech will not be empty and aimless. After the meeting is over, the problem is also solved. Of course, on-site meetings should also have necessary preparations, and the goal should be clear, otherwise it may become a formality. But being "on-site" is always closer to reality than being in a conference room, which is certain. This is the second feeling.
    Currently, the whole country is in a situation of the Great Leap Forward. Our leadership methods and working methods must also keep up with the development of the situation, going deep and decentralizing power, timely discovering advanced things, and using advanced models to influence the middle and drive the backward. This is a good leadership method. The on-site meetings in Hubei are a form of this leadership method. Various places may wish to refer to the Hubei method and try it out. If it works well, then promote it further.

    提倡这种开会方法
    陈之衍
    在我们的日常工作中，开会是不可缺少的一部分。总结工作，布置工作，研究问题，解决问题，都要开会。可是要使会议开得好，收效大，这就很有讲究。
    会可以在会议室开，开得很长，话讲得很多。会也可以到工厂里农村里开，一边参观，一边讨论。湖北省最近采取了后一种开会方法。他们叫做“现场会议”。目的是推广先进经验，让大家先用眼睛去看，边看边讨论，这样，印象深刻，效果很好。
    从这里产生一种感想。
    近几年来，在一些中心城市里，差不多从年头到年尾都开着大大小小的会。成百上千的人，从各地奔赴到这些中心城市里来开会，真可以说是开会忙。各个部门，为了开会，新修了一座座招待所、大礼堂。有一阵子，为了开会，还要专门唱戏、会餐。于是还要准备一批人专门为会议服务。当然有一些会议，是必须在首都和省城来开的，比方说，全国和省、市的人民代表大会、以及其它的一些全国性、全省性的会议。但并不是所有的会都必须开和都必须在大城市开。如果把一些解决工作中问题的会，挪到更靠近群众更接近实际的地方去开，既经济，又实际，效果一定好得多。能够这样办吗？回答是请看湖北省的现场会议，他们已经这样办了，而且办得很好。此感想之一。
    开会必有发言，发言必有总结。但怎样才能言之有物，结之有理，并不是每一个会都解决得很好的。有些会开得很长，话讲得很多，但不一定切合实际和解决问题。而现场会议却能避免这个毛病，它是一边看，一边讲。旁边摆着活生生的事物，讲话不会空洞和无的放矢，会开完了，问题也跟着解决了。当然，现场会议也应有必要的准备工作，目标要明确，否则也可能流于形式。但是在“现场”总比在会议室里要接近实际，这是可以肯定的。此感想之二。
    目前，全国都处在大跃进的形势中，我们的领导方法和工作方法也要跟上形势的发展，深入下放，及时发现先进事物，用先进的典型来影响中间，带动落后，这是一种好的领导方法。而湖北的现场会议就是这种领导方法的一种形式，各地不妨参考湖北的办法试一试，试好了，再推而广之。
