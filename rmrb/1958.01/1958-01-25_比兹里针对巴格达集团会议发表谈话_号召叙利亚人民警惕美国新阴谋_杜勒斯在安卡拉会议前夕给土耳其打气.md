Bizri Speaks Out Against Baghdad Group Meeting
Calls on Syrian People to Be Vigilant Against New American Conspiracy
Dulles Boosts Turkey Ahead of Ankara Meeting
Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, January 23rd: Upon his return to Damascus from Cairo on the 22nd, Bizri called on the people to be vigilant against the conspiracy being hatched by certain elements to create division within Syria. He also said, "We will face a large-scale provocative movement in the coming days, the goal of which is to prevent the establishment of the Egyptian-Syrian Federation. In this movement, someone is taking out millions of dollars in Damascus and Cairo to buy some agents in Egypt and Syria."

Regarding his talks with Egyptian military authorities in Cairo, he said that these talks were "successful."

Referring to the Ankara meeting of the Baghdad Pact scheduled for January 27, Bizri pointed out, "As long as the United States dislikes Syria, there is no doubt that it will bring Syria a gift by Secretary of State Dulles, which can only be a new conspiracy against Syria."

Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: Ankara Dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, who is scheduled to arrive in Ankara in the coming days to attend the Baghdad Pact meeting, wrote a letter to Turkish citizens on the 22nd, expressing "great concern" for Turkey's "economic development." He also raised the cliché of the so-called "Soviet threat" and encouraged Turkey to show "courage."

According to United Press International, this letter, published by the Turkish official Anatolian News Agency, was intended to strengthen the "morale" of the member states of the pact on the eve of the upcoming Baghdad Pact Council meeting. The meeting of the pact's economic committee, a prelude to the Council meeting, just ended on the 21st. UPI said that the four Muslim member states—Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey—were "extremely disappointed" with the economic committee meeting because they requested increased assistance from the United States and Britain but did not receive "guarantees."

It can be seen from the UPI report that Dulles attempted to arouse "new hope" for increased U.S. economic "aid" among the Muslim countries of the Baghdad Pact in this letter.

Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: Ankara Dispatch: The Baghdad Pact Economic Committee concluded its five-day secret meeting in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, on the 21st.

On the same day, the Baghdad Pact "Counter-Subversion Committee" also began holding secret meetings. Representatives from the five member states of the Baghdad Pact and the United States participated in the meetings of these two committees, which were both preludes to the Baghdad Pact Council meeting scheduled to be held in Ankara on January 27.

The communique issued at the end of the Baghdad Pact Economic Committee meeting stated that the Baghdad Pact's "economic efforts and resources" should be focused on: "promoting communication between countries within the treaty area through efficient transportation and communication networks" and encouraging "the maximum freedom of movement of materials and personnel" between these countries. The communique also stated that the meeting recommended that the Baghdad Pact Council meeting "consider early and sympathetically providing assistance to the joint programs that have been adopted."

Middle Eastern public opinion has long pointed out that the U.S. "aid" to Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan to develop so-called "transportation" is actually to build strategic highways and railways in these countries near the Soviet border to serve U.S. aggression plans. At the Baghdad Pact Council meeting in Karachi last June, the United States had already promised to allocate $12.5 million from the "Eisenhower Doctrine" fund for this purpose. Britain also provided £2 million.

### 比兹里针对巴格达集团会议发表谈话  号召叙利亚人民警惕美国新阴谋  杜勒斯在安卡拉会议前夕给土耳其打气

    比兹里针对巴格达集团会议发表谈话
    号召叙利亚人民警惕美国新阴谋
    杜勒斯在安卡拉会议前夕给土耳其打气
    据新华社大马士革23日电比兹里在22日从开罗回到大马士革的时候，号召人民警惕某些分子正在策划的企图在叙利亚内部制造分裂的阴谋。他还说：“我们将要在最近几天内面临广泛规模的挑衅运动，这个运动的目标是要阻止埃叙联邦的建立。在这个运动中，有人在大马士革和开罗拿出成百万的美元来收买一些在埃及和叙利亚的代理人”。
    关于他在开罗同埃及军事当局的会谈，他说，这些会谈是“成功的”。
    在谈到巴格达条约即将在1月27日举行的安卡拉会议时，比兹里指出，“只要美国不喜欢叙利亚，毫无疑问，它将会由国务卿杜勒斯带给叙利亚一个礼物，这个礼物只能是对叙利亚的新阴谋”。
    新华社23日讯　安卡拉消息：预定日内到达安卡拉参加巴格达条约会议的美国国务卿杜勒斯，22日写给土耳其公民一封信，表示“非常关怀”土耳其的“经济发展”。他还提出所谓“苏联威胁”的滥调，并且鼓励土耳其显示“勇气”。
    据合众社透露，这封由土耳其官方的安那托里亚通讯社发表的信，是为了在即将举行的巴格达条约理事会会议前夕，用来加强这个条约成员国的“士气”的。作为理事会会议前奏的这个条约的经济委员会会议刚在21日结束。合众社说，四个穆斯林成员国——伊拉克、伊朗、巴基斯坦、土耳其——对经济委员会会议“极度失望”，因为它们要求美国和英国增加援助，但是没有得到“保证”。
    从合众社的消息中可以看出，杜勒斯在这封信中企图引起巴格达条约穆斯林国家对于增加美国经济“援助”的“新希望”。
    据新华社22日讯　安卡拉消息：巴格达条约经济委员会21日结束了它在土耳其首都安卡拉举行的五天秘密会议。
    同一天，巴格达条约“反颠复委员会”也开始举行秘密会议。有巴格达条约五个成员国和美国的代表参加的这两个委员会的会议，都是预定要在1月27日在安卡拉举行的巴格达条约理事会会议的前奏。
    巴格达条约经济委员会会议结束时发表的公报说，巴格达条约“在经济方面的努力和资源”应当集中在：“通过高效率的运输和交通网促进条约地区内各国间的联系”和鼓励这些国家之间的“物资和人员的最大限度的自由往来”。公报还说，这个会议建议巴格达条约理事会会议“及早和同情地考虑对已经通过的联合计划提供援助”。
    中东舆论早就指出，美国“援助”土耳其、伊拉克、伊朗和巴基斯坦发展所谓“交通运输”，实际上是在靠近苏联边境的这些国家内建设战略公路和铁路，为美国的侵略计划服务。在去年6月的巴格达条约理事会卡拉奇会议上，美国已经为这个目的答应从“艾森豪威尔主义”的基金中拨出一千二百五十万美元。英国也提供了两百万英镑。
