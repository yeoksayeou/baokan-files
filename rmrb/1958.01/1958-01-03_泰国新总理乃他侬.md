Introducing Figures:

The newly elected Thai parliament has now elected Army leader General Thanom Kittikachorn as the new Prime Minister. He is the former Minister of Defense and Deputy Leader of the newly formed National Socialist Party led by General Sarit Thanarat.

Thanom is a close associate of Sarit Thanarat, the current Supreme Commander of the Thai Armed Forces, for many years. He assisted Sarit in the coup that overthrew the government of Plaek Phibunsongkhram in September 1957 and played a very important role.

In November 1947, when the military group headed by Plaek Phibunsongkhram launched a coup to overthrow the government of Thamrongnawasawat, Thanom was then a regimental commander under the infantry brigade led by Sarit. He followed Sarit and other officers and actively participated in this event.

After the success of the coup, he continued to assist Sarit for a long time, holding various important military positions. In August 1955, Thanom entered the cabinet as Deputy Minister of Cooperatives. In March and August 1957, he successively served as Deputy Minister of National Defense (with Sarit as Minister) and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army.
