Conducting a Socialist Education Against Local Nationalism Among Minority Nationalities
Liu Geping

I.

Over the past eight years, the achievements in the work concerning minority nationalities under the leadership of the Party have been enormous. Now, regional autonomy has been implemented in more than 90% of the areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities. In over 85% of the areas inhabited by minority nationalities, the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has been basically achieved. There are more than 400,000 ethnic minority cadres and more than 450,000 Party members from various minority nationalities. Over 90% of these cadres and Party members were developed after liberation, and the vast majority of them are good cadres who can connect with the masses. Most ethnic autonomous regions have developed some modern industry and transportation, and have some industrial workers. In agriculture, compared to 1952, grain production in most minority areas has increased by 30% to 50% in 1956. Although the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture suffered a severe drought in 1956, it still increased production by 30% compared to 1952; in the area where the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region will be established, the average grain production per person in 1956 was nearly 500 kilograms; Inner Mongolia averaged 650 kilograms per person; Xinjiang averaged 300 kilograms per person (including more than 600,000 pastoral people who do not produce much grain). In terms of animal husbandry, the number of livestock at the end of 1956 in various minority nationalities was 168.2% of the number in the early days of liberation. The number of primary and secondary school students in minority nationalities accounts for more than 11% of the population.

The above facts illustrate that over the past eight years, under the correct leadership of the Party, the vast majority of minority nationalities in our country have undergone fundamental changes in their character due to the Five Great Movements, the Three Great Transformations, and socialist construction. The relationship between the nationalities in our country has become closer and more united on the new basis of the victory of socialist transformation in the Han nationality and most minority nationalities. Our Party has established close ties with the people of minority nationalities, and the Party has a deeply rooted foundation in the vast majority of minority nationalities. It would be wrong to fail to see this fundamental change in minority nationalities, or to underestimate the profound and epoch-making significance of this change. At the same time, we must also see that, like in the Han areas, the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes in minority nationalities, many of them are equally unwilling to accept the continuous victory of the socialist revolution, and are equally trying their best to struggle and resist. In the past year or two, local nationalism has grown anew. Last spring, when the right-wing elements among the Han nationality rampantly attacked the Party, the right-wing elements in the minority nationalities also launched vicious attacks on the Party and socialism at the same time. This is a reflection of their struggle and resistance.

II.

In the past year or two, especially since our Party decided to start the rectification campaign and implement extensive airing of views in all aspects, the reactionary or extremely erroneous remarks and activities exposed among a small number of upper-class elements in minority nationalities have been numerous and serious. The main ones are:

1.  Separatist thoughts and activities. The most prominent is that some people, under the pretext of the right of national self-determination, want to establish a union republic or an autonomous republic. But there are also a few people who openly express their desire for independence, saying, "Even if we don't have socialism, we still want independence," "If the Han people continue to come, we will block the border." During this period, among the Mongolian nationality, mainly among the few intellectual youth and students who came from feudal princes, nobles, or high-ranking bureaucratic families of the puppet Mongolian regime, or who were corrupted by bourgeois ideology, separatist activities were very active. They attempted to organize the Party and the government, and even a few students united to prepare to flee abroad, attempting to carry out activities to split the motherland. Some students and intellectuals among the Korean nationality are also unwilling to recognize China as their motherland. A right-wing element from the Daur nationality in Heilongjiang, named Bu Lin, actively campaigned for the establishment of a Daur Autonomous Prefecture, but in the autonomous prefecture he envisioned, 99% were Han and Mongolian people, and Daur people were only 1%. Even so, he said: "Our goal is to establish an autonomous republic and a union republic."

2.  Using autonomy rights and nationalization as excuses to reject the leadership of the Central Government and the Party, and to exclude Han cadres. Some minority cadres in Xinjiang shouted that they did not want Han cadres and asked Han cadres to go back. They said: "The area will only be an autonomous region after the Han cadres leave. It is impossible to have autonomy if the Han cadres do not leave." Zhuang right-wing element Huang Xianfan said: "As long as there are Han cadres, minority nationalities will not be able to take power. All Han cadres should be transferred out of minority areas." They especially opposed Han cadres holding leadership positions in the autonomous regions, both inside and outside the Party.

3.  Opposing Han farmers and workers going to minority areas. In order to achieve the purpose of excluding Han people, in Xinjiang, some people advocated the early realization of agricultural mechanization; among the Mongolian nationality, some people advocated that it was better to not have Baotou Steel, modern industry, or railways, and advocated dividing pure Mongolian areas and pure Han areas in order to isolate the Mongolian nationality from other nationalities. Some people also advocated that industrial and mining enterprises should also be run by a single nationality. Some also opposed learning Han Chinese and the languages ​​of other nationalities, and opposed cultural exchanges between nationalities.

4.  Opposing socialist transformation. Saying that the cooperative movement was ruined, that cooperatives had no superiority; that unified purchase and marketing were ruined, that farmers' lives were miserable; that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was ruined, and that good people were being punished, etc. The tone was exactly the same as that of the right-wing elements in the Han nationality. The anti-socialist arguments of the Han right-wing elements were all present in the minority right-wing elements.

5.  Hating the Party and opposing the Party. Saying that "Party members are a privileged class," that "the Party's leadership is the rule of Han chauvinism," that "minority nationalities have not yet been liberated and need a second liberation," that "minority nationalities can achieve liberation and build socialism on their own without the leadership of the Party." Right-wing elements Wang Tianxi, Ou Baichuan, Peng Bo, Bu Lin, Ma Songting, etc. all had small group activities to oppose the Party's leadership. They especially hated Party and League members of their own nationalities, saying that Party and League members of their own nationalities were traitors, national scum, people who licked boots, degenerate elements, etc. On the contrary, they said that anti-Party elements were national heroes. They spared no effort in attacking the Party leaders of minority nationalities. Ma Songting, a right-wing element among the Hui people, said that Hui Communist Party members did not understand the affairs of the Hui people, ate pork, and married Hui girls to Han people, which was a shameless fabrication and slander of Party cadres.

III.

Since the extensive airing of views, many reactionary and erroneous remarks have been exposed among some upper-class elements of minority nationalities. The above are just a few of the most prominent. Some of the people who made these remarks or carried out these activities are bourgeois nationalists, and some are seriously influenced by bourgeois nationalism. Because these remarks are mostly made under the banner of nationality, and appear to be upholding the interests of the nationality, (and many do not involve national issues, and are just nakedly anti-Party and anti-socialist like the right-wing elements in the Han nationality, which are easier for the masses to see through and criticize.) so they can still capture and confuse some people. Especially in many minority nationalities, due to the estrangement and influence left over from the old era, the market for this kind of remark may be even wider. Therefore, even though there are only a small number of people who make this kind of remark among the minority nationalities, we cannot ignore its dangerous role. We must seriously and resolutely criticize this kind of remark.

First, the right-wing elements in minority nationalities clamor that the present is not as good as the past, and that the Communist Party is not as good as the Kuomintang. They say this from the standpoint of the dying bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, and naturally they have their reasons. Because if there was no liberation, so many Party members would not have been developed in the local minority nationalities, so many cadres would not have been trained, and there would have been no land reform to overthrow landlords and rich peasants, and there would have been no socialist transformation to change the ownership of capitalists. Because of liberation, reform, and transformation, their warlords, bureaucrats, landlords, bullies, and capitalists can no longer arbitrarily exploit people, can no longer oppress and exploit the people like cattle and horses, and can no longer live that kind of extravagant life -- like the bullies in the nationalities who believe in Islam, they can no longer marry seventy or eighty wives in their lives and arbitrarily insult women, so they want to oppose socialism and want to restore capitalism or the old feudal or slave-owner system. In order to confuse the masses, they dress themselves up as if they are speaking for their own nationality, but in reality they are using national relations to cover up their ugly faces. For these right-wing elements and people with seriously wrong ideas, we must expose their faces and reveal their original ugly faces to the masses. As long as we do this, after the truth comes out, the masses will abandon them.

Second, regarding separatist thoughts, that is, the issue of wanting to establish a republic or a federal system. Among the Mongolian, Korean, Hui, Uyghur, and other nationalities, this kind of thought mainly exists among non-Party young intellectuals. However, in individual minority nationalities, this kind of thought is relatively serious, not only among non-Party members, but also among Party members; not only among general Party members, but also among individual high-ranking Party cadres, and they have seriously influenced a considerable number of cadres inside and outside the Party.

In our China, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution, in order to ensure the equality of all nationalities, to unite all nationalities to help each other and cooperate in building socialism together, it is appropriate to implement a regional autonomous system rather than a federal system and the establishment of a republic in the national organization. This was clearly decided by the Party Central Committee as early as 1949. The Central Government's decision was made based on the historical development conditions of our country and the epochal conditions of our revolution, and based on the current and long-term common interests of all nationalities in our country. This decision is completely in line with the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and is one of the brilliant examples of our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao ingeniously combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. When the first CPPCC meeting was held, the responsible comrades of the Central Government discussed this issue with the comrades of minority nationalities who participated in the meeting, and they all agreed, and the CPPCC Common Program also stipulated it. Article 53 of our country's constitution also clearly stipulates: "The administrative division of the People's Republic of China is as follows: (1) The whole country is divided into provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government; (2) Provinces and autonomous regions are divided into autonomous prefectures, counties, autonomous counties, and cities." The constitution was repeatedly discussed by people and representatives of all nationalities in 1954. More than 170 representatives from the thirty ethnic minority groups who participated in the first National People's Congress unanimously agreed and unanimously passed it through secret ballot. Comrade Liu Shaoqi made a detailed explanation in his report on the constitution. Over the past eight years, the responsible comrades of the Central Government have repeatedly explained this issue. Last August, Premier Zhou gave a detailed report on this issue from a theoretical perspective and from the actual situation of the Chinese nationalities at the Qingdao Nationalities Symposium. In principle, this issue should have been resolved, but for some people, it has not been resolved. Why is this? If, at the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic of China, it could be said to be a naive and confused idea for some people who can only recite individual phrases of Marxism-Leninism regarding the right to national self-determination but do not deeply understand the theory of Marxism-Leninism on the nationality issue, then after the founding of the People's Republic of China for eight years and the promulgation of our country's constitution for three years, it is difficult to explain it from a cognitive confusion. They say that only the implementation of a federal system and the establishment of a republic are in line with the principles of Leninism. This is a distortion of Leninism. Lenin has repeatedly said that our recognition of the right to national self-determination does not mean that we Communists have the obligation to support any national demand for state separation. Whether it is appropriate for a certain nationality to demand separation, we must have an independent assessment. This assessment must first consider the interests of the proletariat in the struggle for socialism. Lenin repeatedly said the benefits of a large country and the benefits of a unitary state after the success of the revolution. Why are these words of Lenin ignored?

Of course, the vast majority of cadres are good and stand on the correct side. Some people's erroneous remarks are deviations and confusion in their thinking and understanding. But a very small number of people have serious local nationalist thoughts. These people should be reminded to turn back as soon as possible, otherwise they will become miserable worms crying in a corner, like the stubborn right-wing elements in the Han nationality, who will definitely be abandoned by the masses.

Third, the mutual integration of nationalities is an inevitable phenomenon of historical development, and no nationality can avoid it. Of course, it is reactionary for one nationality to forcibly assimilate other nationalities, but natural integration is a very natural phenomenon. After liberation, the equality and unity of all nationalities and mutual assistance were realized in our country. In the common development of all nationalities, the walls of national estrangement in the past were demolished, and mutual exchanges became increasingly close. Therefore, all nationalities can absorb useful things from each other. The right-wing elements and local nationalists in minority nationalities are alarmed by this phenomenon, believing that the nationality is about to perish. Therefore, they advocate building walls again to re-isolate all nationalities, and refuse and oppose mutual assistance between nationalities, especially opposing the assistance of the Han nationality. This kind of thought is reactionary. Our Party has always paid attention to the characteristics of all nationalities and respected the customs and habits of all nationalities. Article 3 of the General Program of the Constitution also stipulates that all nationalities "have the freedom to maintain or reform their own customs and habits," advocates promoting the excellent cultural traditions of all nationalities, and advocates developing the languages ​​and scripts of all nationalities. Up to now, we have formulated writing schemes for twenty nationalities that had no written language before. Some schemes have been implemented, and some are being tested and promoted. We advocate a culture with socialist content in national form, and we will continue to do so in the future, but this must not become an excuse to exclude Han people, oppose learning Han Chinese, and absorb the excellent things in the Han nationality's economy and culture. Migrating farmers and assigning workers to minority areas is extremely beneficial to the development of minority areas. Some minority areas are sparsely populated and lack labor. If they want to be developed and have great economic development, it is impossible without immigrants from other places. In the past, in this regard, some shortcomings such as insufficient consultation, insufficient publicity, insufficient respect for local customs and habits, damage to the interests of some local people, or insufficient consideration of the unified arrangement of the local working people, must be corrected. Minority nationalities should take a warm and welcoming attitude towards immigrants from outside. A rejecting attitude is wrong, because opposing immigration is not beneficial to the country and not beneficial to the people of their own nationality.

Fourth, the issue of the nationalization of autonomous organs has always been emphasized by the Central Government, but it depends on the situation of the training and growth of communist cadres of all nationalities. The nationalization we advocate is to accelerate socialist construction, not to oppose socialist transformation and socialist construction. The growth of communist cadres requires a certain process, a certain amount of work experience and ideological transformation. Inappropriate promotion of cadres is not conducive to work and to individuals. In the past, there was also insufficient respect for the powers of national cadres; all subjective shortcomings should be corrected. However, it is completely wrong to use the nationalization policy as an excuse to oppose the Party's leadership and exclude Han cadres. Party organs should select local ethnic minority cadres to participate as much as possible, but this cannot be confused with the issue of the nationalization of autonomous organs. Our Party is a unified party of the Chinese working class and represents the interests of the people of all nationalities in our country. The issue of the ethnic composition of Party organs must be handled according to the principles of communist unity and solidarity. It is absolutely wrong to advocate dividing Party organizations according to ethnic composition and to adopt a discriminatory and opposing attitude towards Party members of other nationalities participating in local Party organizations and holding leadership positions.

IV.

Seeing the seriousness and danger of the above remarks and activities, the Central Government decided that while the nationwide rectification movement is deepening, it is also necessary to conduct rectification, socialist education, and appropriately fight against right-wing elements in minority nationalities according to different circumstances, and to make opposition to local nationalism an important part of rectification and socialist education. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has given clear instructions on this in the report of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth National Congress. Here, I would like to talk about a few specific opinions:

First, in carrying out rectification and the anti-rightist struggle in minority nationalities, it is necessary to carefully and appropriately distinguish between local nationalists and those who have certain local nationalist thoughts or certain national prejudices, and to distinguish between nationalism and legitimate national sentiments, etc. Local nationalists are essentially bourgeois right-wing elements, right-wing elements in ethnic clothing, but except for those who have significant anti-Party, anti-socialist, and disruptive remarks and actions against national unity and national solidarity, the general ones should still be treated as contradictions among the people. This is beneficial to winning over, uniting, and educating the majority of intermediate states, people with certain nationalistic thoughts and emotions, and isolating a few right-wing elements, and it is also convenient for us to educate the general people with local nationalistic sentiments. The correct national sentiments of ethnic minority personnel should be protected. Do not regard all national sentiments as nationalistic things.

Second, there are quite a few right-wing elements in minority nationalities, and we should have sufficient estimates. But on the other hand, we must also see that the Party and League members, cadres, the broad non-Party masses, and even the upper-class figures of all minority nationalities have made great progress under the Party's education in recent years. We must believe in the progressive forces in minority nationalities and believe in the broad masses of the people. So don't be afraid that the anti-rightist struggle in minority nationalities will not be successful, and don't think that there are no left-wing forces to rely on in minority nationalities. On the contrary, in the anti-rightist struggle in minority nationalities, we must rely on the backbone of our own nationality and mobilize the masses of our own nationality. The Nationalities Publishing House criticized a right-wing element of the Daur nationality. He originally said he was Mongolian, and his reactionary remarks were all about Mongolian issues. At first, he neglected to mobilize Mongolian cadres. Only Han and other ethnic cadres actively fought, and after two months of fighting, he still did not bring him down. Finally, he mobilized Mongolian cadres to expose his large number of reactionary remarks and deeds, and presented the reality of the Mongolian nationality and conducted a sharp rational struggle with him, which made him isolated and plead guilty. I think this experience is useful in all minority nationalities.

Third, in the anti-rightist struggle and criticism of nationalism in minority nationalities, the work of winning over the middle elements is of greater importance, and we must work hard to do a good job in this regard. Because the national question has great complexity, it is easy for right-wing elements and local nationalists to use the national question to incite and confuse people. Therefore, in the movement, special attention should be paid to using the theory of Marxism-Leninism on the national question and the Party's national policy theory to arm the left and persuade and win over the middle factions. The policies and policies of our Party are correct. As long as we can fully explain them to the masses, the vast majority of people in minority nationalities will definitely stand on the correct side. This is the reason why we firmly believe that the struggle against right-wing elements and the criticism of local nationalism in minority nationalities will surely be victorious.

It should also be noted that this work must be more detailed than in the Han area, and the preparation must be more adequate. Special attention should be paid to rectifying and correcting at the same time. We still have many shortcomings in our nationality work, and we must resolutely correct them in order to more effectively unite the middle elements and isolate the right-wing elements.

    在少数民族中进行一次反对地方民族主义的社会主义教育
    刘格平
    一
    八年来，在党领导下的少数民族工作的成绩是巨大的。现在有90％以上少数民族人口的聚居地区，已经实行了区域自治。85％以上的少数民族人口地区，基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造。各少数民族中已有四十多万民族干部，四十五万多党员，这些干部和党员，90％以上是在解放以后发展的，绝大部分都是能联系群众的好干部。大多数的民族自治地方，多少都有了一些现代工业和交通运输业，并且有了一些产业工人。在农业方面，以1956年和1952年相比，绝大部分少数民族地区，粮食产量增加了30％到50％。广西僮族自治州1956年虽然遭受大旱，还比1952年增产30％；在将要建立的宁夏回族自治区的地方，1956年每人平均产粮近一千斤；内蒙平均每人一千三百斤；新疆平均每人六百多斤（包括不大产粮的六十多万牧区人口）。在牧业方面，各少数民族1956年底牲畜头数等于解放初期的168.2％。少数民族中的中小学生，已占人口11％以上。
    以上的事实说明了：八年以来，在党的正确领导下，我国绝大多数的少数民族，由于经过了五大运动，进行了三大改造和社会主义建设，民族的面貌已经发生了根本性的变化。我国各民族之间的关系，在汉族和大多数少数民族社会主义改造胜利的新的基础上，更加亲密团结了。我们党和少数民族的人民建立了密切的联系，党在绝大多数少数民族中有了根深蒂固的基础。看不到少数民族中的这种根本性质的变化，或者对这种变化的深刻的、划时代的意义估计不足，都是错误的。但同时我们也必须看到，和汉族地区一样，少数民族中的资产阶级和其他剥削阶级，对于社会主义革命的不断胜利，有许多人也同样是不甘心的，同样在尽力挣扎和反抗。近一两年来，地方民族主义有了新的滋长。去年春天，在汉族中的右派分子猖狂向党进攻的时候，少数民族中的右派分子，也同时向党、向社会主义进行了恶毒的攻击，这就是他们这种挣扎和反抗的反映。
    二
    近一两年来，特别是自从我们党决定开始整风、各方面实行大鸣大放以后，在少数民族的少数上层分子中暴露出来的反动的或极端错误的言论、活动是很多很严重的。主要的有：
      一、分离主义的思想活动。最突出的是有的人借口民族有自决权，想搞加盟共和国或自治共和国。但也有少数人露骨地表示要独立，说“那怕不要社会主义也可以，我们就是要独立”，“如果汉人继续来，我们就把边界封锁起来。”这个期间，在蒙古族中，主要是在出身于封建王公贵族或伪蒙的高级官僚家庭的、或为资产阶级思想所腐蚀的少数知识分子青年学生中，分离主义的活动很活跃。他们企图组织党和政府，甚至有少数的学生结合起来准备逃到外国，企图去进行分裂祖国的活动。朝鲜族中也有一些学生、知识分子，不愿承认中国是祖国。黑龙江达呼尔族有个右派分子名叫卜林，他积极活动成立达呼尔自治州，但在他设想的自治州范围内，99％都是汉人、蒙古人，达呼尔人不过1％。就是这样，他还说：“我们的目的是成立自治共和国和加盟共和国”。
    二、借口自治权利和民族化，不要中央和党的领导，排斥汉族干部。新疆有些少数民族干部叫喊不要汉族干部，叫汉族干部回去。他们说：“汉族干部走了，才算自治区，汉族干部不走，就无法自治。”僮族右派分子黄现璠说：“只要有汉族干部，少数民族就无法当权，汉族干部应全部从少数民族地区调出去”。他们特别反对在自治地方党内外担任领导工作的汉族干部。
    三、反对汉族农民、工人到少数民族地区去。为了达到排斥汉人的目的，在新疆，有人主张抢先实现农业机械化；在蒙古族中，有人主张宁可不要包钢，不要现代工业，不要铁路，主张划分纯蒙区，纯汉区，以便把蒙古族和别的民族隔离起来。还有人主张工矿企业也要搞单一民族的。还有的反对学习汉文汉语和别的民族的文字，反对各民族间的文化交流。
    四、反对社会主义改造。说合作化搞糟了，合作社没有优越性；统购统销搞糟了，农民生活痛苦；肃反搞糟了，尽整了好人等等。和汉族中的右派分子的腔调完全一样。汉族右派分子的反社会主义论调，在少数民族右派分子中应有尽有。
    五、仇恨党，反对党。说“党员是特权阶级”，“党的领导是大汉族主义的统治”，“现在少数民族还没有解放，要来第二次解放”，说“没有党的领导，少数民族自己也能取得解放和建设社会主义”。右派分子王天锡、欧白川、彭泊、卜林、马松亭等都有小集团活动来反对党的领导。他们尤其是仇视本民族的党、团员，说本民族的党、团员都是叛徒，是民族败类，是溜尻子拍马屁的人，是蜕化堕落分子等等。相反地说反党分子是民族英雄。对于少数民族中的党的领导人，更是不遗余力地加以攻击。回民中右派分子马松亭说回民共产党员都不懂回民的事情，都吃了猪肉，把回回姑娘都嫁给汉人了，更是无耻的造谣侮蔑党员干部。
    三
    大鸣大放以来，在少数民族的一些上层分子中暴露的反动的和错误的言论很多，以上所列举的不过是其中几条最突出的而已。有这种言论或活动的人，有的是资产阶级民族主义者，也有的是受到严重的资产阶级民族主义的影响。由于这些言论大都是打着民族的旗帜，是以维护民族利益的面貌出现的，（也有许多并不涉及民族问题，和汉族中的右派分子一样就是赤裸裸地反党、反社会主义，那就更易于为群众所看清，所批判。）所以还能俘虏和迷惑一些人。特别是在许多少数民族中，由于旧时代遗留下来的隔阂和影响，这种言论的市场就可能更为广泛一些。因此，尽管有这种言论的人只是少数民族中的一小撮人，却不能忽视它的危险作用，对于这种言论，我们必须加以严肃的、坚决的批判。
    第一，少数民族中的右派分子叫嚣说今不如昔了，共产党还不如国民党。他们站在垂死的资产阶级和其他剥削阶级的立场上这样说，自然也是有他们的道理的。因为如果不解放，就不会在当地少数民族中发展这么多党员，培养这么多干部，也就不会搞土改，把地主、富农反倒，不会搞社会主义改造，把资本家的所有制改掉。由于解放了，改革了，改造了，他们这些军阀、官僚、地主、恶霸、资本家再不能任意剥削人了，再不能把人民当作牛马一样压迫剥削了，再不能过那种骄奢淫佚的生活了，——像信仰伊斯兰教的民族中的恶霸，再不能一生娶七、八十个老婆、任意侮辱妇女了，所以他们要反对社会主义，要想恢复资本主义或封建的、奴隶主的旧制度。为了迷惑群众，他们把自己装扮起来，好像是在替本民族说话，实际上他们是在利用民族关系，掩盖他们的丑恶面目。对于这种右派分子和严重错误思想分子，我们必须揭穿他们的面目，把他们本来的丑恶的面目暴露给群众，只要我们这样作了，真象大白以后，群众就会抛弃他们的。
    第二，关于分离主义思想，即想搞共和国、联邦制的问题。在蒙古族、朝鲜族、回族、维吾尔族和其他民族中间，主要是党外青年知识分子存在着这种思想。但是在个别的少数民族中，这种思想就比较严重，不仅党外有，党内也有；不仅一般党员有，个别党的高级干部也有，他们还严重地影响了相当一部分党内党外的干部。
    在我们中国，在人民民主革命胜利以后，为了保障各民族的平等，团结各民族互助合作共同建设社会主义，在国家组织上应该实行区域自治制度而不宜于实行联邦制和成立共和国，这是早在1949年党中央就明确决定了的。中央的这个决定，是根据我国的历史发展条件和我国革命的时代条件，根据我国各民族目前的和最长远的共同利益作出的。这种决定是完全符合马克思列宁主义的原则的，是我们党中央和毛主席英明地把马列主义普遍真理和中国革命的实践相结合的光辉的范例之一。这个问题，在第一届政协开会的时候，中央的负责同志找参加会议的少数民族的同志商谈过，他们都同意了，政协共同纲领也规定了。我国宪法的第五十三条也明确规定：“中华人民共和国的行政区域划分如下：（一）全国分为省、自治区、直辖市；（二）省、自治区分为自治州、县、自治县、市”。宪法是在1954年经过各民族人物和代表反复讨论，参加第一届人民代表大会的三十个少数民族成分的一百七十多个代表，一致同意并且经过秘密投票一致通过的。刘少奇同志在关于宪法的报告里，又曾详尽的作了说明。八年以来，中央负责同志多次地解释过这个问题，去年8月，周总理在青岛民族座谈会上又从理论上和中国民族实际情况上详细地报告了这个问题。按道理说，这个问题是应该得到解决了，但对某些人来说，还总是解决不了，这是为什么呢？如果说在中华人民共和国成立之初，对于某些只会背诵马列主义的关于民族自决权的个别词句而并未深刻理解马列主义关于民族问题的理论的人来说，还可以说是幼稚、糊涂观念，那么在中华人民共和国成立了八年，我国宪法颁布了三年之后，那就很难从认识上的糊涂来解释了。他们说只有实行联邦制成立共和国才是符合列宁主义原则的，这是歪曲列宁主义。列宁曾经多次地说过，我们承认民族自决权，决不是说我们共产党人对于任何一种民族的国家分离要求，都有支持的义务。对于某一个民族要求分离是否适宜，我们要有独立的评断，这种评断，首先是要考虑无产阶级为社会主义而斗争的利益。列宁多次地说过在革命成功之后大国的好处，单一制的国家的好处。对于列宁的这些话为什么熟视无睹呢？
    当然，绝大多数的干部是好的，是站在正确的方面的，有些人的错误言论，是思想认识上的偏差和糊涂。但有极少数的人，是有严重的地方民族主义思想的。应该提醒这些人及早回头，不然会和汉族中的顽固的右派分子一样，一定会变成为群众所抛弃的向隅而泣的可怜虫。
    第三，各民族间的互相融合，是历史发展的必然现象，任何民族都不能避免，一个民族用强制的方法去同化别的民族，当然是反动的，但自然的融合，却是很自然的现象。解放后在我们国家实现了各民族的平等和团结互助，在各民族共同发展中，过去民族隔阂的墙被拆掉了，互相交往日益密切了，因而各民族间能够彼此吸取有益的东西。少数民族中的右派分子和地方民族主义者，对这种现象大惊小怪，认为民族要灭亡了，因此主张再筑起一道道的墙，把各民族重新隔离起来，拒绝和反对各民族间的互相帮助，特别反对汉族的帮助。这种思想是反动的。我们党从来是注意各民族特点、尊重各民族的风俗习惯的。宪法总纲第三条也规定各民族“都有保持或者改革自己的风俗习惯的自由”，主张发扬各民族的优良文化传统，主张发展各民族的语言文字。到现在为止，我们已为二十个以前没有文字的民族制定了文字方案，有的方案已在实行，有的在试验推行。我们主张民族形式社会主义内容的文化，今后仍然要坚持这样作，但这决不能成为排斥汉人，反对学习汉文汉语和吸取汉族经济文化中优良事物的借口。往少数民族地区迁移农民，调派工人，对于发展少数民族地区是极为有益的。有些少数民族地区地广人稀，劳动力缺乏，要想开发，要想在经济上有大的发展，如果没有外地的移民是不可能的。过去在这方面的工作中，有些协商不够、宣传不够、尊重当地风俗习惯不够、损害当地部分群众利益、或者对当地劳动人民的统一安排考虑不周的缺点，一定是要加以纠正的。少数民族对于外来移民，应该抱热诚欢迎的态度，排斥的态度是错误的，因为反对移民对国家不利，对本民族人民也不利。
    第四，自治机关民族化的问题，中央从来即很强调，但是要看各民族中共产主义干部培养和成长的情况决定。我们主张的民族化，是为了加速社会主义建设，而不是为了反对社会主义改造和社会主义建设。共产主义干部的成长是需要一定的过程的，需要一定的工作锻炼和思想改造，不适当的提拔干部，对于工作、对于个人都不利。过去对民族干部的职权也有尊重不够的地方；凡是属于主观缺点的，都应该改正。但借口民族化政策反对党的领导，排斥汉族干部，是完全错误的。党的机关应该尽可能地选拔当地少数民族干部参加，但这不能和自治机关民族化的问题混为一谈，我们党是中国工人阶级统一的政党，是我国各民族人民利益的代表者，对于党的机关的民族成分问题，必须根据共产主义的统一和团结的原则来处理，主张按民族成分为标准来划分党的组织，对别的民族的党员参加当地党组织和担任领导工作采取歧视反对态度，都是绝对错误的。
    四
    由于看到以上种种言论和活动的严重性和危险性，中央决定在全国整风运动正在深入开展的时候，在少数民族中也要分别不同情况，进行整风、社会主义教育和适当地反右派斗争，并且把反对地方民族主义作为整风和社会主义教育的一项重要内容。邓小平同志在八大三中全会报告中对此已有明确指示，这里我想谈几点具体意见：
    第一、在少数民族中进行整风和反右派斗争，必须慎重地适当地划清地方民族主义者和有某些地方民族主义思想或某种民族偏见的人，划分民族主义和正当的民族情感等等。地方民族主义者实质上即是资产阶级右派分子，是披着民族外衣的右派分子，但除了其中有显著的反党反社会主义、破坏祖国统一和民族团结的言论和行动的以外，一般的仍旧作为人民内部的矛盾去处理。这样作对于争取团结教育大多数中间状态的、有某些民族主义思想情绪的人和孤立少数右派分子是有好处的，也便于我们去教育一般有地方民族主义情绪者。对于少数民族人员的正确的民族情感，应该加以保护。不要把一切民族情感都看作是民族主义的东西。
    第二、少数民族中的右派分子是不少的，我们应该有足够的估计。但另一方面，还必须看到各少数民族中的党、团员干部，广大的非党群众，甚至上层人物，几年来在党的教育下，是有了很大的进步的。必须相信少数民族中进步的力量，相信广大人民群众。所以不要怕在少数民族中反右反不起来，不要认为少数民族中没有左派力量可以依靠。相反地，在少数民族中反右，必须依靠本民族中的骨干，发动本民族的群众。民族出版社批判一个达呼尔族的右派分子，他原来说是蒙古族，反动言论也都是关于蒙古族问题的，开始忽视了发动蒙古族干部，只是汉族和别的民族的干部积极去斗，斗了两个月，还没有斗倒，最后发动了蒙古族干部，揭露出他的大量的反动言行，并且摆出蒙古族的现实情况和他进行了尖锐的说理斗争，才使他陷于孤立，低头认罪。我认为这个经验在一切少数民族中都是有用的。
    第三、在少数民族中进行反右和批判民族主义的时候，争取中间分子的工作，有更大的重要性，必须努力作好这方面的工作。由于民族问题有很大的复杂性，右派分子和地方民族主义者利用民族问题进行煽惑很容易迷惑人，所以在运动中，要特别注意用马列主义关于民族问题的理论和党的民族政策的理论来武装左派，说服争取中派。我们党的方针政策是正确的，只要我们能够充分向群众解释清楚，少数民族中绝大多数的人都是肯定会站在正确的方面来的。这就是我们坚信在少数民族中反击右派和批判地方民族主义一定能够取得胜利的理由。
    还要注意，这个工作比汉区须更加细致一些，准备上要更充分一些。特别要注意边整边改，我们在民族工作上仍有不少的缺点，要坚决的加以改正，才能更有力的团结中间分子和孤立右派分子。
