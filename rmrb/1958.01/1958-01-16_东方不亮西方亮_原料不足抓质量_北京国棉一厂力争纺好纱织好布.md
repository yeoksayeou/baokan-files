When the East is not bright, the West is: Overcoming Raw Material Shortages by Focusing on Quality – Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill Strives to Spin Good Yarn and Weave Good Cloth

(According to the Beijing Daily report) The entire workforce of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill, not discouraged by objective limitations on production increases, is instead filled with confidence and drive, proposing to strive for a major leap forward in quality this year. Their specific goals are: to achieve 75% "zero defects" (the best cloth with no defects on a single piece) in the first quarter; and to have 50% of weft yarn reach "top-grade evenness" (the most uniformly fine yarn) and 30% of other yarn counts reach "top-grade evenness" within the year.

In light of the fact that the state will not be able to fully supply cotton this year, the factory's Party committee has issued a call to strive for a "quality leap forward" while comprehensively fulfilling the state plan. This call from the Party committee has powerfully inspired the fighting spirit of the workers. After discussing how to achieve the 75% "zero defects" requirement, the workers in the weaving workshop, in conjunction with the workers in the front and back spinning workshops, jointly proposed: to basically eliminate slub yarn defect cloth and weft shrinkage defect cloth, which account for the largest proportion of defects. The front spinning workshop workers, in coordination with the weaving workshop, and with the assistance of the technical department, researched and improved the equipment of the carding machines. By the 6th of this month, 60% of the cloth produced by the factory was already "zero defects".

The Party committee's requirement to improve the quality of yarn is a rigorous test for all the workers and engineers in the factory. In the past, the factory produced very little "top-grade evenness" yarn, only 2-3%. Initially, some technicians doubted whether this goal could be achieved. In response, the factory organized in-depth discussions with all the technicians and relevant skilled workers. Through discussions, the workers built confidence and immediately organized a technical research group led by the chief engineer, together with fine yarn maintenance workers, to study improvement methods. The maintenance workers were also invigorated, guaranteeing that after each fine yarn machine was repaired, at least one "top-grade evenness" yarn sample would be produced in the nine samples checked. This guarantee has now been largely achieved. Currently, the technical team and the maintenance workers have further proposed a guarantee: to cultivate several key machines in the first quarter that can consistently spin "top-grade evenness" yarn; and to use this as a basis for studying and promoting the practice universally in the second quarter.

While proposing a "quality leap forward," the Party committee also asked everyone to reduce the amount of cotton used per piece of yarn by one kilogram, based on the achievements already made last year, saving 30,000 kilograms of cotton throughout the year; and to continue to reduce the factory's electricity consumption by 5%, saving 10,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity throughout the year.

This spinning machine is a relic from the era when Zuo Zongtang created the Northwest Woolen Cloth Weaving Bureau during the Qing Dynasty. It had long been abandoned before liberation. After liberation, the workers of the Northwest Woolen Textile Factory repaired and modified it. It is now responsible for spinning yarn for plaid blankets sold abroad.

### 东方不亮西方亮　原料不足抓质量  北京国棉一厂力争纺好纱织好布

    东方不亮西方亮　原料不足抓质量
    北京国棉一厂力争纺好纱织好布
    本报讯　据北京日报报道：国营北京第一棉纺织厂全厂职工受客观条件限制不能增产也决不气馁，反而信心百倍、干劲十足，提出今年要全力争取质量上的大跃进。他们的具体奋斗目标是：第一季度“零分布”（一匹布上没有一个疵点的最好的布）达到75％；年内纬纱50％达到“调杆优级”（粗细最均匀的优等纱），其它纱支30％达到“调杆优级”。
    根据国家今年不能充分供应棉花的情况，这个厂的党委提出了在全面完成国家计划的前提下，争取“质量大跃进”的号召。党委这一号召，有力地激励了职工群众的战斗热情。织布车间职工讨论了如何实现75％的“零分布”这一要求以后，同前纺后纺车间工人联合提出倡议：要基本上消灭占比例最大的竹节纱次布和纬缩次布。前纺车间职工配合织布车间，在技术科协助下，研究改进了梳棉车的设备。到本月6日，这个厂生产出来的布，已经有60％是“零分布”。
    这个厂党委提出的提高纱的质量的要求，对全厂工人和工程技术人员是一个严格的考验。过去，这个厂纺出的“调杆优级”纱，数量很少，只有2—3％。这次，部分技术人员开始时也怀疑过是否能达到这一目标。针对这一情况，这个厂组织全厂技术人员和有关的技术工人进行了深入的讨论。通过讨论，职工们树立了信心，并且立即组织了一个以总工程师为首的技术研究小组，同细纱保全工人等一起研究改进的办法。保全工人也人人振奋，保证使各台细纱车在检修以后，抽查的九块样板纱中，至少要出一块“调杆优级”纱。现在保全工人的这一保证已经基本实现了。目前，技术小组和保全工人们又进一步提出保证：要在第一季度培养出几台重点车，能经常纺出“调杆优级”的纱锭来；第二季度再以此为基础，研究普遍推广。
    在提出“质量大跃进”的同时，党委要求大家在去年已经取得的成绩的基础上，再把每件棉纱的用棉量降低一公斤，全年节约棉花三万公斤；并使全厂用电量继续降低5％，全年节约万度电。（附图片）
    这台纺纱机是清朝左宗棠创建西北织呢局时代的遗物。解放以前早就废置不用了。解放以后，西北毛纺织厂的职工们修复并改装了它。现在担任着销售国外的方格毛毯的纺纱工作。
