According to the Gansu Daily, to date, the rectification work of more than 13,000 cooperatives, accounting for 66.5% of the total number of cooperatives in the province, has been successfully completed. The progress of the work shows that this massive rectification work has achieved significant results throughout the province.

During the rectification, the vast majority of cooperative cadres took the lead in participating in productive labor, and the members joyfully said: "Members are soldiers, cooperative cadres are generals; when the generals take the lead, the soldiers follow, and production will definitely be victorious!" In the Red Star Cooperative of Lanzhou City, in the past, no one wanted to go to the toilet to collect manure, but the director of the cooperative did it himself, which greatly moved the members, and as a result, they all rushed to do it. Cooperatives with unclear accounts or those that had not been made public for a long time have now been thoroughly cleared and detailed announcements have been made, and future financial systems have been established and improved. The members of 555 cooperatives in Jingchuan, Huachi, and Pingliang counties cleared their accounts and reported: "In the past, it was like a muddled temple with muddled gods. Now, no matter how much income or expenditure, we are clear, and we are more energetic in our work!" Regarding the scale and organizational structure of the cooperatives and teams, many cooperatives have also made reasonable adjustments. In the later stage of the rectification, all cooperatives conducted democratic elections. Through the election of cooperative cadres, on the one hand, the personnel were streamlined, so that the remuneration and subsidies for cooperative cadres were generally controlled within 1% of the total working days; on the other hand, people who were truly supported by the masses were elected, the class line was implemented, and the advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants was effectively established in the leadership composition of the cooperatives. During the rectification, all cooperatives also conscientiously implemented the spirit of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily. Some checked the waste in harvesting and threshing, and formulated plans for careful harvesting and threshing; others debated the phenomenon of not cherishing public property in the cooperatives. 80% of the members in Jiuquan County have made plans to save food.

Due to the great debate and the great improvement of the class consciousness of the masses in the process of rectification, and the rational resolution of many problems within the cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives have been unprecedentedly consolidated and united, and a vigorous new atmosphere has emerged. The vast number of members are more determined to take the socialist road and love the cooperatives as their homes. According to incomplete statistics from the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, before the great debate, 611 households in the prefecture applied to withdraw from the cooperatives, but now all of them have decided not to withdraw. The rectification has also greatly changed the face of many third-class cooperatives. According to statistics from 411 cooperatives in Longde and Huachi counties, the number of first-class cooperatives increased from 173 to 264 before the rectification, and the number of third-class cooperatives decreased from 68 to 9.

According to the Hubei Daily, a large-scale rural rectification upsurge has formed throughout Hubei Province and is advancing rapidly with a momentum that is breaking through all obstacles. According to statistics from more than 31,000 cooperatives in the four special districts of Xiangyang, Jingzhou, Huanggang, and Xiaogan, cooperatives that have launched rectification work account for 85%, of which 5% have completed rectification, and 15% are about to begin rectification.

The province's rural rectification work is being carried out on the basis of the victory of the socialist education movement, combined with an unprecedentedly large-scale winter production upsurge. At the same time as the rectification of the cooperatives, the rectification of the Party, the League, and the rectification of cadre style are also being carried out. The entire rectification process is continuing to make full use of the mass line working methods of great airing of views, great contending, and great debate. Therefore, the movement is large in scale, progresses quickly, and solves many problems well.

According to the needs of production and the urgent demands of the masses, various places have focused on solving the following key issues in this period of rectification:

First, rectify the Party, the League, and rectify the cadre style. After the rectification, the relationship between cadres and the masses has undergone great changes. Many cadres and Party members who participated less in production in the past are now actively involved in production and leading the masses forward. Cheng Qingyun, director of the Tongfeng Cooperative in Xishui County, used to be "wearing shoes and socks and carrying a cloth bag," and was seriously detached from the masses. After the rectification, he changed, and the masses called him a "good cadre." Some cooperatives where the leadership was controlled by rich middle peasants in the past, as well as cooperatives secretly manipulated by landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements, have established the leadership advantage of poor peasants after organizational rectification, and a new atmosphere has emerged in production.

Second, distribution and final accounts, and properly handle specific issues. Such as clearing warehouses and settling accounts, making finances public, further adjusting the relationship between the state, the collective, and the members, arranging for households with difficulties, and handling three guarantees, etc.

Third, handle relevant economic issues, such as the valuation of mountain forests, repaying members' surplus production funds when they joined the cooperative, repaying share funds, and adjusting the labor remuneration of handicraft cooperative members, etc. After the economic problems were resolved, the members were very satisfied.

After the rectification, the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses have been unprecedentedly improved, and many third-class cooperatives and backward teams in the first and second-class cooperatives have undergone significant changes. At present, the province's rural rectification upsurge is continuing to develop in depth.

    抓住干部作风和财务等关键问题大整大改后
    甘肃湖北广大农民干劲十足
    本报讯　据甘肃日报报道：到目前为止，占全省总社数66.5％的一万三千多个社的整社工作，已经胜利结束。工作的进展情况说明，这一声势浩大的整社工作，已在全省范围内获得了显著成绩。
    整社中，绝大多数社干，都带头参加了生产劳动，社员们欢欣鼓舞的说：“社员是兵，社干是将；将军带头兵跟上，生产一定打胜仗！”兰州市红星社，过去谁也不愿去掏厕所搞大粪，社主任亲自下手，使社员们大为感动，结果都争先恐后去做。过去账目不清或长期不公布账目的社，这次都作了彻底的清结和详细的公布，并建立和健全了今后的财务制度。泾川、华池、平凉三县五百五十五个社清理了账目，社员们反映：“过去是糊涂庙糊涂神，现在不管收支多少，咱们心明了，干活也有了劲头！”关于社、队规模和组织机构问题，不少社也进行了合理的调整。整社后期，各社都进行了民主选举，通过选举社干，一方面做到了人员精简，使社干部的报酬补贴一般控制在总劳动日的1％以内；另方面，选出了群众真正拥护的人，贯彻了阶级路线，使社的领导成份中，切实树立了贫农、下中农的优势。各社在整社中，还认真贯彻了勤俭办社、勤俭持家的精神，有的检查了收割、打碾中的浪费现象，订出了细打细收的计划；有的对不爱护社内公共财物的现象进行了辩论。酒泉县80％的社员订出了节约粮食的计划。
    由于大辩论和整社过程中大大提高了群众的阶级觉悟，合理地解决了社内许多问题，因而农业社得到了空前的巩固和团结，出现了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象，广大社员走社会主义道路和爱社如家的思想更加坚定。据固原回族自治州不完全的统计，大辩论前，全州申请退社的有六百一十一户，现在全部不退了。整社使得许多三类社的面貌也有了很大改变，据隆德、华池两县四百一十一个社统计，整社前一类社由一百七十三个增至二百六十四个，三类社由六十八个减少到九个。
    本报讯　据湖北日报报道：一个规模宏大的农村整改高潮已在湖北全省范围内形成，并以乘风破浪的声势迅速前进。据襄阳、荆州、黄冈、孝感四个专区三万一千多个社的统计，开展整改工作的合作社已占85％，其中已经整改结束的占5％，即将开始整改的占15％。
    全省农村整改工作，是在社会主义教育运动取得胜利的基础上，结合空前规模的冬季生产高潮进行的。在整社的同时，并结合了进行整党、整团以及整顿干部作风。整个整改过程，是继续充分运用大鸣、大放、大辩论的群众路线的工作方法进行的。因此，运动的规模大，进展快，解决的问题既多又好。
    根据生产需要和群众的迫切要求，各地在这一段整改工作中，突出抓住解决了以下几个关键问题：
    第一，整党、整团、整顿干部作风。经过整改后干群关系有了很大的变化。许多过去参加生产少的干部和党员，现在积极投入了生产，带领群众前进。浠水县同丰社主任程庆云，过去是“脚穿鞋袜，手提布袋”，严重脱离群众，经过整改后转变了，群众都称他为“好干部”。部分在过去被富裕中农掌握领导权的合作社，以及地主、富农和坏分子暗中操纵的合作社，经过整顿组织，树立了贫农领导优势，生产出现新气象。
    第二，分配决算，妥善处理具体问题。如清仓结账、公开财政、进一步调整国家、集体和社员的三者关系，安排困难户、处理三包等。
    第三，处理有关经济遗留，如山林折价，偿还社员入社时多余的生产资金，偿还股份基金，调整手工业社员劳动报酬等等。经济问题处理后，社员们都很满意。
    经过整改，广大干部和群众的政治热情和生产热情空前提高，不少三类社和一、二类社中的落后队，有了显著的改变。目前，全省农村整改高潮正继续深入向前发展。
