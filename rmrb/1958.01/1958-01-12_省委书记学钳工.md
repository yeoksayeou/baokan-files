Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 10th. The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant added three new workers today. They are Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee; Su Gang, Deputy Secretary-General; and Yan Jun, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of National Industries. They decided to regularly go to this factory to learn turning and fitting techniques from veteran workers and familiarize themselves with the work of turners and fitters.

At 1:30 p.m., Zhang Pinghua, Su Gang, and Yan Jun arrived at the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant. Deputy Director Sun Yi immediately assigned them their tasks: Zhang Pinghua would learn fitting in the tool workshop; Su Gang would learn turning in the first mechanical processing and assembly workshop; and Yan Jun would learn planing in the machine repair workshop. Sun Yi led them into the workshops and introduced them to their masters, veteran workers Wang Haifu, Liu Lanting, and Hu Baolin, respectively. Zhang Pinghua said to his teacher, Wang Haifu: "We will come to work on the 11th. We don't want to interfere with your work, but we also want to have something to do." Hu Baolin even told Yan Jun that he should buy a quick course in blueprint reading.

Under the leadership and advocacy of Zhang Pinghua, leading comrades of the industrial departments of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee are determined to learn from the spirit of experimental plots in agriculture, go to factories such as the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant and the Wuchang Vehicle Plant to participate in physical labor, and become apprentices in order to strengthen ties with the working masses, temper and transform themselves, and gain experience from grassroots work to guide the overall effort.

    省委书记学钳工
    新华社武汉10日电　武汉重型机床厂10日增加了三个新工人，他们是中共湖北省委书记处书记张平化、副秘书长苏钢和国营工业部副部长阎钧。他们决定今后经常到这个工厂向老工人学习车工和钳工技术，熟悉车工和钳工的工作。
    下午一时半，张平化、苏钢和阎钧来到武汉重型机床厂。副厂长孙毅马上分配了他们的工作：张平化到工具车间学钳工；苏钢到第一机械加工装配车间学车工；阎钧到机修车间学刨工。孙毅带领他们进入车间，和王海福、刘兰亭、胡宝林三位老工人分别见面，拜师傅。张平化对他的老师王海福说：我们11日就来上班，既不要耽误你们的工作，也要我们有活做。胡宝林还告诉阎钧，应该买一本速成看图法。
    在张平化带头倡议下，湖北省委工业部门的负责同志学习农业方面搞试验田的精神，决心到武汉重型机床厂、武昌车辆厂等工厂参加体力劳动，当一个徒工，以便密切与工人群众的关系，锻炼改造自己，并从基层工作中取得经验，指导一般。
