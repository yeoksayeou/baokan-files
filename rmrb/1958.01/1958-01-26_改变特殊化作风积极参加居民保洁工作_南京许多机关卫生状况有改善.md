Changing the Special Privileges Style, Actively Participating in Residents' Sanitation Work:
Improved Hygiene Conditions in Many Nanjing Government Offices

(Our Newspaper News) Nanjing City, many government offices and enterprises, combined with the rectification movement, have launched a winter patriotic health campaign, changing the previous practice of "special privileges" for government offices in health campaigns.

In the Zhenghong Street subdistrict of the city, there are 123 central, provincial, municipal, and district government offices and enterprises. In the past, many leaders of government offices did not pay enough attention to sanitation work. Government offices with many people emphasized: "With so many people and so complex a situation, sanitation cannot be improved"; government offices with few people said: "With so few people, sanitation cannot be handled"; many government offices emphasized that work and study were busy, and there was no time for sanitation; individual government offices even used the excuse of "secrecy" to refuse sanitation inspectors entry. Some government office staff members mistakenly believed: "Sanitation work is the responsibility of odd-job workers in government offices and the responsibility of nannies at home." Because many government offices did not actively engage in sanitation, the development of sanitation work in this area was seriously affected.

This time, each government office has made improving sanitation a part of the rectification, so the winter patriotic health campaign has rapidly developed in this area, changing the "special privileges" style of government offices. At the beginning of the campaign, the city leaders stipulated the principle of "each block responsible, each department implement," so the Zhenghong Street subdistrict office immediately invited the heads of relevant government offices to a meeting to study sanitation work. At the same time, they criticized or praised relevant government offices by introducing advanced experiences and reporting on work. This time, many heads of government offices not only attended the street meetings and humbly listened to the criticisms of the masses, but also quickly made plans and established special organizations. Leading comrades of each unit also personally led the masses to participate in the sanitation campaign. According to incomplete statistics from thirty-three government offices, in less than half a month, a total of more than 450 jin of fly pupae were dug up, and many rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, and flies were caught, and a large amount of garbage was cleared. Many government office units have initially developed the habit of loving cleanliness and paying attention to sanitation, changing the "special privileges" phenomenon. The vast majority of government offices have participated in the sanitation work of residential areas and carried out street cleaning. In the past, the Provincial Drama Troupe and the Xiju Opera Troupe emphasized the tension of performances and the instability of work, and sanitation work was very poor. This time, the leaders of the troupes personally took action, and the masses quickly took action. In addition to actively participating in the anti-Four Pests campaign, the comrades of the Provincial Drama Troupe also used their holidays to send more than 7,000 jin of garbage to the countryside as fertilizer. The staff of the Xiju Opera Troupe have developed the habit of doing sanitation anytime, anywhere, and they use their rest time to clean the streets. The Municipal Labor Bureau took the initiative to contact residents to participate in the sanitation work of the area. The Nanjing Crate Factory was a famous dirty unit. The wood piled on the road became a public toilet for pedestrians. The masses repeatedly raised their opinions, but the leaders of the factory ignored them. During this rectification, the leaders of the factory improved the environmental sanitation of this place.

    改变特殊化作风积极参加居民保洁工作
    南京许多机关卫生状况有改善
    本报讯　南京市许多机关、企业结合整风开展冬季爱国卫生运动，改变了以往在卫生运动中机关“特殊化”的作风。
    该市正洪街街道办事处地区有中央、省、市、区的机关、企业单位一百二十三个。过去，不少机关单位的领导上对卫生工作很不重视。人多的机关强调：“人多复杂，卫生搞不起来”；人少的机关说：“人手少，卫生搞不过来”；不少机关强调工作、学习忙，没有时间搞卫生；个别机关甚至借口“保密”，把检查卫生的同志拒之门外。有些机关工作人员错误地认为：“卫生工作在机关是勤杂工的事，在家庭是保姆的事”。由于许多机关单位不积极搞卫生，严重地影响了这个地区卫生工作的开展。
    这次，各机关把搞好卫生作为整改的一项内容，因此冬季爱国卫生运动在这个地区迅速地开展起来，改变了机关“特殊化”作风。运动开始时，该市领导上规定了“块块负责，条条贯彻”的原则，因此，正洪街街道办事处立即邀请有关机关的负责人开会研究卫生工作，同时，通过介绍先进经验和汇报工作，对有关机关进行批评或表扬。这次许多机关负责人不仅出席了街道会议，虚心听取群众的批评，而且很快作出了计划，成立了专门组织，各单位的领导同志还亲自带领群众投入卫生运动。据三十三个机关不完全统计，不到半个月，共挖蝇蛹四百五十多斤，捉到许多鼠雀蚊蝇，并且清除了大量垃圾。许多机关单位，初步养成了爱清洁、搞卫生的习惯，改变了“特殊化”现象。绝大部分机关参加了居民地区的保洁工作，进行街道清扫。该省话剧团、锡剧团过去强调演出紧张，工作不固定，卫生工作搞得很差。这次剧团领导上亲自动手，群众就迅速行动起来了。该省话剧团的同志们除了积极投入除四害运动外，还利用假日把七千多斤垃圾送到农村作肥料。锡剧团的工作人员养成了随时随地搞卫生的习惯，并且利用休息时间清扫街道。该市劳动局主动和居民联系参加了地段保洁工作。南京板箱厂是有名的肮脏单位，木材堆在马路上成了行人的公共厕所，群众一再提出意见，但该厂领导上却置之不理。这次整风中该厂领导上改善了这个地方的环境卫生。
