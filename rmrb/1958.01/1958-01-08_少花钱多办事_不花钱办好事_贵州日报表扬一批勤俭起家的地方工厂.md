Accomplish More with Less Money, Accomplish Good Things Without Spending Money
Guizhou Daily Commends a Group of Local Factories that Started with Thrift

(Reported by this newspaper) On December 26, 1957, the front page of the Guizhou Daily, under the headline "Oppose the Young Master Style of Work and Run Enterprises with Poor Methods," introduced the experiences of the Dading United Factory in Dading County, the Fuquan Power Plant in Anshun Prefecture, the Tianzhu County Printing Factory, the Kaiyang County Kaiyang Distillery, and the Dezhuo Copper Mine in Hezhang County in running enterprises thriftily. At the same time, it criticized the Tianzhu County Oil Press for not considering the supply of raw materials, blindly building a large factory, and buying large machines, resulting in a long delay in putting them into production. Even after production began, the equipment capacity could not be fully utilized, reflecting a "young master" style of work. The Guizhou Daily also published an editorial entitled "How Can We 'Catch Up'?", explaining that only by running enterprises with poor methods can we achieve a great leap forward in industrial production alongside the great leap forward in agricultural production, and gradually improve the backwardness of industrial production in Guizhou Province.

The Dading United Factory was built in 1952. Its main products are now white liquor, local paper, and black gunpowder, with a total of sixty-one employees. When the factory was first built, it only borrowed 3,000 yuan from the bank as capital construction funds. They used a local dilapidated temple and open space to build factory buildings, purchased the necessary tools, established a wine stove and a paper vat, and organized thirteen employees to start production.

Later, with the expansion of market demand, they successively expanded eight wine stoves and potassium nitrate workshops, storage rooms, and warehouses using the method of "repairing the old and supplementing the new." The factory buildings still adhered to the principle of simplicity and economy, with thatched roofs and mud walls. The equipment installation was also relatively reasonable and easy to operate. Until now, the factory has not built a single new office or dormitory, but has repaired and used dilapidated houses. In the past few years, the total investment in expansion has only been 15,000 yuan, equivalent to 17% of the factory's profits turned over to the state in recent years.

As early as 1955, the Fuquan Power Plant saw that many areas around it did not have agricultural implement repair and fitting organizations, and the inconvenience of repairing agricultural implements for farmers affected production. At the same time, the factory's production tasks were also insufficient. In addition to generating electricity for a few hours at night, the workers had nothing to do during the day. Therefore, the factory leadership decided to attach an agricultural implement repair and fitting factory to the Machangping Power Plant branch. Twelve workers from the factory were divided into forging, electrical repair, and plate workshops, and began to solicit odd jobs. Initially, without a lathe, they went to Guiyang and bought a discarded lathe for four jiao per jin, repaired it into a hand-cranked lathe; without pliers and sledgehammers, the workers collected scrap iron and made them themselves; without a factory building, they borrowed a small place from the district committee for temporary use. In this situation, they started production. Their business operating policy was to do whatever the local area needed, which was very popular with farmers. In 1956, the supply of agricultural implements in the county was very tight, and the handicraft cooperatives could not keep up with the demand. The factory vigorously manufactured more than 2,000 agricultural implements, supplying the needs of farmers in four townships near Machangping. During the spring plowing last year, they also repaired and manufactured more than 300 agricultural implements for farmers. In the construction of water conservancy projects, they installed mechanical water lifting stations for several agricultural cooperatives such as Jinxing and Dayuan. In the past, it was not easy for agricultural cooperatives to hire people from Guiyang to install machinery, and the round-trip expenses were five times more expensive than now. Therefore, the farmers were very satisfied.

The Dezhuo Copper Mine in Hezhang County was put into production in early December last year. In the construction of the mine, with an investment of 3,000 yuan, it took more than twenty days to build this small mine.

The copper reserves of the Dezhuo Copper Mine are suitable for small-scale mining. Forty years ago, someone used manual methods for mining and smelting. There is still an old-fashioned furnace that has been in disrepair for many years, a rotten bellows, and piles of ore here and there. There are also two old workers in the local area who participated in the indigenous smelting method. The relevant departments of Hezhang County started the capital construction work on November 7, 1957. In order to accomplish more with less money and achieve quick results, they relied on restoring and repairing the dilapidated original equipment for production, in addition to purchasing the necessary smelting tools. Under the command of two local old workers, after seven days and nights of smelting in the open air, four tons of raw copper were smelted, worth more than 4,000 yuan. They plan to build ten new furnaces this year, with an annual output of 300 tons and an output value of more than 100,000 yuan.

The Tianzhu Printing Factory was built in 1953. At that time, due to the lack of funds in the county, it was impossible to purchase more equipment, so they rented two old lithographic presses and hired two workers to start production. Because the factory was small and the expenses were saved, the price of the products was cheaper than the goods purchased from other places, and the sales were very good. In the first year, they made money, and the rest was used for expanded reproduction after paying taxes. As a result of this gradual development, in addition to buying over the rented lithographic presses, they also added two lithographic presses, a hand press, and a disc machine, and the number of workers increased from two to eleven.

The Tianzhu County Oil Press did not carefully study the local actual situation. When they thought of running industry, they wanted it to be as big as possible and asked the province for investment. The Provincial Department of Industry approved an investment of 400,000 yuan and decided to let them buy a set of 200-type oil press equipment. The boiler required for the 200-type oil press could not be produced in Guiyang, so they had to buy it in Shanghai, Tianjin and other places. Capital construction started in March 1956, and it has been nearly two years since the equipment was installed. The 200-type oil press can press 6 million jin of rapeseed per year, and the planned output of rapeseed in the county this year is only 4 million jin. Moreover, in order to concentrate the county's rapeseed and disperse the oil cakes, it will cost an additional 50,000 yuan in freight per year. Therefore, at the Guizhou Provincial Local Industry Conference held in December last year, the comrades concerned in Tianzhu County examined the "young master" style of work in the process of running this factory and stated that they would resolutely develop small-scale local industries in accordance with the principles of less investment, easy construction, and quick results, to serve the construction of mountainous areas.

    少花钱多办事  不花钱办好事
    贵州日报表扬一批勤俭起家的地方工厂
    本报讯　1957年12月26日贵州日报一版，在“反对大少爷作风用穷办法办企业”的大标题下，介绍了大定县大定联合工厂、安顺专区福泉电厂、天柱县印刷厂、开阳县开阳酒厂和赫章县德卓铜矿勤俭办企业的经验，同时批判了天柱县榨油厂不考虑原料供应情况，盲目建大厂、买大机器，结果迟迟不能投入生产，投入生产以后也将不能充分发挥设备能力的大少爷作风。贵州日报还以“怎样才能‘迎头赶上？’”为题发表社论，说明只有用穷办法办企业，才能在农业生产大跃进的同时，使工业生产也有一个大跃进，才能逐步改进贵州省工业生产的落后面貌。
    大定联合工厂是1952年建设的，现在的主要产品有白酒、土纸、黑色炸药三种，全厂职工六十一人。他们这个厂在开始建设的时候，只从银行贷三千元作为基本建设资金。他们利用当地的一所破庙和空地修建厂房，购买了必要的工具，建立了一个酒灶和一个纸槽，组织了十三个职工投入生产。
    以后，随着市场需要的扩大，他们陆续以“修旧补新”的办法，扩建了八个酒灶和钾硝车间、保管室、仓库等。所建厂房仍坚持简陋节约的原则，厂房都是茅草屋顶和土墙。设备安装也较为合理，操作方便。直到现在，该厂仍然没有新建一间办公室及宿舍，都是修理破屋使用。几年来，扩建投资共只花一万五千元，相当于该厂几年来上缴利润的17％。
    早在1955年，福泉电厂看到周围许多地区都没有农具修配机构，农民因修理农具不便，影响了生产。同时，厂里的生产任务也不足，除晚上发电几个钟头外，白天工人没有事干。于是，该厂领导就决定在马场坪电厂分厂附设一个农具修配厂。把厂里的十二个工人，划分为锻工、电修、板间等车间，开始招揽零活。最初，没有车床，他们就到贵阳以四角钱一斤计算买了一部废车床，修理成为手摇车床；没有钳子、大锤，工人们就收集废铁自己动手制造；没有厂房，就向区委会借一块小地方暂用。在这样的情况下，开始投入了生产。他们的业务经营方针，是当地需要什么就干什么，很受农民欢迎。1956年全县农具供应很紧张，手工业社生产赶不上需要，厂里就大力赶制了农具二千多件，供应了马场坪附近四个乡农民的需要。去年春耕中，他们又为农民修理和制造各种农具三百余件。在兴修水利中，他们为金星、大愿等几个农业社安装了机械提水站。过去农业社去贵阳请人安装机械，不但不易请到，而且来回花费要比现在贵五倍。所以农民非常满意。
    赫章县德卓铜矿是去年12月初才投入生产的。在建矿中，以三千元的投资，花去二十多天的时间，就把这个小矿建成了。
    德卓铜矿的铜储量适宜小规模开采，四十年前曾经有人以手工方式开采冶炼。现尚遗留有年久失修的旧式火炉一座，烂风箱一个，和东一堆西一堆的矿石。当地还有两个参加过土法冶炼的老工人。赫章县有关部门便于1957年11月7日开始了基本建设工作。为了做到少花钱多办事，收效快，他们除了购置必要的冶炼工具外，都是靠恢复修理破烂不堪的原有设备来进行生产的。在当地两个老工人指挥下，在露天下经过七昼夜的冶炼，炼出毛铜四吨，价值四千多元。他们计划今年再建十座新炉，年产量可达三百吨，产值十万余元。
    天柱印刷厂是在1953年兴建的。当时因县里缺乏资金，无法购置更多设备，于是他们就租用两部旧的石印机，请两个工人开始生产。因为厂子小，开支节省，所以产品价格比外地进货便宜，销路很好。第一年赚了钱，除上缴外，其余用来扩大再生产。这样逐步发展的结果，除把租用的石印机买过来，又增添了两部石印机、一部手扳机、一部圆盘机，工人也由二人增加到十一人。
    天柱县榨油厂没有认真研究当地实际情况，一想办工业，就想愈大愈好，要求省里投资。省工业厅批准了四十万元投资，决定让他们买一套200型的机器榨油厂的设备。而200型的榨油机所需的锅炉贵阳不能生产，只好到上海天津等地买，从1956年3月开始基本建设，到现在将二年时间还未安装好设备。200型榨油机一年可榨菜籽六百万斤，今年全县菜籽的计划产量也只有四百万斤。而且为了集中全县菜籽和分散油饼，每年就要多用运费五万元左右。因此，在去年12月份举行的贵州省地方工业会议上，天柱县有关同志检查了办这个厂过程中的大少爷作风，并表示今后坚决根据投资少、建设易、收效快的原则，大力发展小型的地方工业，为山区建设服务。
