Xinhua News Agency, January 21st. Beijing will hold elections for representatives to the Municipal, District, and Township (Town) People's Congresses in the first half of this year and is preparing to convene People's Congresses at all levels successively.

This was decided at the sixth meeting of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee held today. The meeting formulated an election work plan based on the decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the State Council, and decided to establish the Beijing Municipal Election Committee composed of twenty-one members including Liu Ren, responsible for carrying out various preparatory tasks for the election.

The 1958 election work plan adopted by the Beijing Municipal People's Committee stipulates that the election of representatives to the Municipal, District, and Township (Town) People's Congresses will be prepared simultaneously and carried out in a coordinated manner, striving to basically conclude the election activities of the grassroots people in March, and convene the People's Congresses of townships, towns, and districts in April and May, and elect representatives to the Municipal People's Congress.

The plan also stipulates that representatives to the People's Congresses of districts in urban areas and townships and towns in suburban areas shall be directly elected by voters. A street office is generally divided into two constituencies, and a township with only one agricultural production cooperative is, in principle, divided into constituencies according to production teams. Larger organs, factories, mines, enterprises, and schools that can produce more than one district representative based on the permanent population can be separately designated as a constituency. Election methods must strive to be convenient for the masses. Units in urban districts and suburban areas that directly elect representatives to the District People's Congresses should set up polling stations in sections according to the different production, work, and study times of voters, and conduct anonymous voting.

The plan requires that publicity work be done in conjunction with all steps of the election work, so that the broad masses can receive a profound education in socialist democracy, and mobilize voters to actively and enthusiastically participate in the election.

    北京市开始普选筹备工作
    新华社21日讯　北京市在今年上半年内将举行市、区、乡（镇）三级人民代表大会代表的选举，并准备相继召开各级人民代表大会。
    这是在今天举行的北京市人民委员会第六次会议上决定的。会议根据全国人民代表大会常务委员会和国务院的决定作出了选举工作计划，决定成立以刘仁等二十一人组成的北京市选举委员会，负责进行选举的各项筹备工作。
    北京市人民委员会通过的1958年选举工作计划中规定，市、区、乡（镇）三级人民代表大会代表的选举工作，同时准备，衔接进行，争取在3月份基本结束基层人民群众的选举活动，四、五两月召开乡、镇和区的人民代表大会，并选举市人民代表大会的代表。
    计划还规定，城区各区和郊区各乡、镇人民代表大会代表由选民直接选举。一个街道办事处一般划为两个选区，只有一个农业生产合作社的乡，原则上按生产队划分选区。按常住人口计算能够产生一名以上区代表的较大的机关、厂矿、企业、学校，可单独划成一个选区。选举方法必须力求便利群众。城区各区和郊区直接选举区人民代表大会代表的单位，应当根据选民不同的生产、工作和学习时间，按照选区分段设立投票站，无记名投票选举。
    计划中要求结合选举工作的各个步骤，做好宣传工作，使广大群众受到一次深刻的社会主义民主的教育，发动选民踊跃地、热烈地参加选举。
