Ministry of Light Industry Paper Design Institute Conducts Special Topic Criticism on Anti-Waste:
Exposing Wasteful Phenomena, Finding the Roots of Waste

(Our reporter Zheng Qimin reports) After the general rectification work came to a close, the Ministry of Light Industry Paper Design Institute launched a special topic criticism and debate on anti-waste. According to materials revealed over the past half month, the waste in the institute's design work is shocking. In the seventeen expansion and new construction projects, waste reached more than 39 million yuan, accounting for 15.8% of the total investment of these factories. This wasted money could build five new newsprint factories with an annual output of 15,000 tons. The institute has now taken active measures to stop this serious waste.

What caused such serious waste? Many comrades pointed out in big-character posters and speeches at debates that the main reasons were the "young master" style of the engineering and technical personnel and administrative leaders who were greedy for quantity and size, generous in planning and strict in use, and blindly pursuing beauty and grandeur. As a result, all equipment had to be the newest, best, and most modern, and had to be imported, completely ignoring the policy of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift. This "young master" style was most prominent in the "79 Project" designed by the institute. Originally, more than 90% of the equipment for this project could be manufactured domestically, but the design required 100% use of imported equipment. For example, the various water pumps used could not only be manufactured domestically, but were also of good quality and were still being exported in large quantities, but they insisted on importing them. As a result, this project wasted 12 million yuan simply on blindly purchasing foreign equipment. Originally, one set of equipment would have been enough, but they insisted on designing two or even three sets, resulting in stockpiling and waste. For example, in the "06 Project," the original roasting furnace that could still be used was discarded, and two new sets were purchased. This item alone wasted more than 170,000 yuan.

This "young master" style was also seriously reflected in the administrative expenses of the institute. For example, the institute's surveying and mapping office and photography team purchased many unnecessary and expensive instruments and equipment in order to show off and be generous, wasting more than 100,000 yuan. The institute's staff canteen has been partially electrified, and expensive electric meat slicers, electric vegetable cutters, and electric grinders have been installed. The institute only uses more than 30 tons of coal per month, but the administrative section installed a searchlight, supposedly for the convenience of unloading coal at night. Thus, the institute's administrative expenses, according to incomplete statistics, wasted more than 290,000 yuan.

In the debate, many comrades pointed out that some engineering and technical personnel blindly worshiped the technology of the British and American bourgeoisie, mistakenly believing that British and American technology was good in everything, and even regarded ordinary design drawings used by the United States for propaganda as treasures, using them as the sole basis for their designs. This bourgeois technical viewpoint also brought serious waste to the design work. For example, when the institute designed the "79 Project," Deputy Chief Engineer Xuan Guifen used a design sample of a beater that he had cut out from an American magazine more than ten years ago as the basis for his design of the "79 Project" beater, and without conducting a detailed study of the sample in advance, and without discussing it with the institute's technical personnel, he blindly copied the drawings and placed large orders abroad, resulting in serious waste and technical irrationality.

Some technical personnel of the institute said in the initial anti-waste debate: "We admit that we have bourgeois ideas and bourgeois technical viewpoints, but we are serious and responsible in our work..." However, after further exposure and debate, it turned out that much of the waste in the design and construction was caused by the serious irresponsibility of the engineering and technical personnel. For example, when a deputy chief engineer of the institute went to the Taiyuan Paper Mill in 1954 to test how to solve the problem of pulp lumps in the pulp, the engineer did not use his brain to think and study in detail the causes of this phenomenon, but simply took a teacup, shook the pulp in the teacup, and looked at it, and subjectively came to the conclusion: "The problem of pulp lumps cannot be solved with pumps, it is necessary to build a four- or five-story building and use the method of isopotential difference to solve this problem."

The waste caused by mechanically copying advanced foreign experience in the design, thus causing the design to be out of touch with the actual situation in the country, is also quite shocking. For example, the institute's design for the Guangzhou Paper Mill, the transportation and stacking of logs is a heavy physical labor, how to mechanize it is an extremely complex problem, the design did not study it, and blindly followed the general methods introduced in the books, blindly carrying out a series of transportation mechanization designs and construction. After completion, it was found that it was not applicable, and had to be dismantled, wasting more than 200,000 yuan.

After exposing these serious wastes, the institute actively adopted the methods of "disaster relief" and "dyke building," mobilizing the masses to come up with ideas and find ways to recover these serious losses. The so-called disaster relief is to actively take measures to save the projects in the design that have already resulted in waste, such as conducting a comprehensive study of the projects that have been designed but not yet constructed, and modifying the unreasonable designs; the so-called dyke building is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the projects currently under design, find out the causes of waste, and formulate correct design regulations to prevent possible waste in the future. At present, with the active participation of all engineering and technical personnel, a comprehensive inspection and accounting has been carried out on the "79 Project." For example, the original design for a five-story building to handle pulp lumps, constant temperature and humidity equipment, and diesel locomotives have been cancelled. The over-ordered foreign equipment has also been properly handled. Through this debate, many engineering and technical personnel realized that it is necessary to implement the policy of diligence and thrift in running socialist enterprises, and that it is impossible to run socialist enterprises well without politics.

    轻工业部造纸设计院反对浪费专题鸣放
    揭发浪费现象　找出浪费根源
    本报讯　记者郑启民报道：轻工业部造纸设计院，在一般整改工作告一段落后，掀起了反对浪费的专题鸣放和专题辩论。从半个多月来所揭发的材料中看，该院设计工作中的浪费是惊人的，在扩建和新建的十七个工程中，浪费达三千九百多万元，占这些厂总投资的15.8％。拿这些浪费的钱即可建年产一万五千吨的新闻纸厂五个。现在该院已采取积极办法制止这种严重浪费。
    什么原因造成了这样严重的浪费呢？许多同志在大字报和辩论会的发言中都指出，主要是工程技术人员和行政领导存在着贪多求大，宽打窄用，一味追求美观大方的“大少爷”作风。因而样样设备都要最新最好最现代化的，并且要进口货，完全忽视了勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针。这种“大少爷”作风，在该院所设计的“79工程”中表现得最为突出。本来这项工程有90％以上的设备，可由国内制造，但是在设计中却要求百分之百的使用进口设备。例如，所用的各种水泵，国内不但能够制造，而且质量很好，至今还在大量出口，但他们一定要进口的。结果这项工程单在盲目购置国外设备上就浪费了一千二百万元。本来有一套设备就够用了，但硬要设计两套甚至三套，结果也形成积压和浪费。如“06工程”中的焙烧炉，原来还可以使用的炉子不用，又新购置两套。这一项就浪费了十七万多元。
    这种“大少爷”作风还严重地表现在该院行政经费的开支上。如该院的勘察处和照相组，为了摆阔气，讲大方，购置了很多不必要的贵重仪器和设备，这一项，也浪费了十万多元。该院职工食堂已部分电气化，高价装置了电气切肉机、电动切菜机、电磨等。该院每月只用三十多吨煤，而行政科据说是为了晚上卸煤方便，就装置了一架探照灯。这样，该院在行政费的开支方面，据不完全的统计，浪费达二十九万多元。
    在辩论中，许多同志指出有些工程技术人员一味崇拜英美资产阶级的技术，错误地认为英美的技术什么都是好的，甚至把美国用来作为宣传的一般设计图样，捧为至宝，作为自己进行设计的唯一依据。这种资产阶级的技术观点，也给设计工作带来了严重的浪费。如该院设计“79工程”的时候，副总工程师宣桂芬，曾把十多年前自己从美国杂志上剪下来的一张打浆机的设计样本，作为他设计“79工程”打浆机的根据，而且对这个样本事先既没有进行过详细的研究，采用时又没有经过该院技术人员的讨论，就盲目复制图样，向国外大量订货，结果造成了严重浪费和技术上的不合理。
    该院有些技术人员，在最初的反浪费的大辩论中说：“说我们有资产阶级思想和资产阶级的技术观点，这，我们都承认，但是，我们对工作是认真负责的，……”。然而，经过进一步的揭发和辩论以后，原来设计施工中有许多浪费是由于工程技术人员严重的不负责任所造成的。如该院一位副总工程师，1954年到太原造纸厂去试验如何解决纸浆里的浆疙瘩问题时，这位工程师不开动脑筋思考，和详细研究产生这种现象的原因，而只是极简单地拿一个茶杯，把浆水放在茶杯里摇一摇，看一看，就主观地得出了这样的结论：“解决浆疙瘩问题，用泵是不能解决的，必须要建筑一个四、五层的大楼，用同位差的办法解决这个问题。”
    在设计中生搬硬套外国的先进经验，因而使设计与本国实际情况脱节，形成的浪费也相当惊人。如该院对广州造纸厂的设计，原木的运输与堆垛是一项重体力劳动，如何才能使其机械化是一项极为复杂的问题，设计时未加研究，就盲目的按照书本上介绍的一般方法，照样画葫芦的进行了一系列的运输机械化的设计和施工。完工之后，才发现不适用，结果只好拆除，浪费了二十多万元。
    该院在揭发出这些严重的浪费以后，就积极地采取了“救灾”“筑堤”的方法，发动群众出主意想办法来挽回这些严重的损失。所谓救灾，就是将设计中已经形成浪费的项目，积极采取措施，进行挽救，如将已经设计完毕但尚未施工的项目，全面进行研究，修改不合理的设计；所谓筑堤就是对现在正在设计的工程，进行全面检查，找出浪费原因，制定出正确的设计规程，以防止今后可能发生的浪费现象。目前在全体工程技术人员积极参加下，对“79工程”已进行了全面的检查和核算。如现已将原设计为处理浆疙瘩的五层大楼，恒温恒湿设备，柴油机车等取消了。对多订的国外设备也进行了适当的处理。通过这次辩论，使很多工程技术人员认识到办社会主义企业必须贯彻执行勤俭节约的方针，脱离政治是办不好社会主义企业的。
