Xinhua News Agency, 4th: During the First Five-Year Plan, the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army made significant contributions to the nation's railway construction, and in the construction of new railways, it developed into a technologically and experienced force. Since participating in new railway construction projects in 1954, the Railway Corps has participated in twenty projects including the construction and repair of main lines, branch lines, dedicated lines, and large bridges. By the end of 1957, the railways that had been laid and opened to traffic reached 1,951 kilometers, accounting for 47.7% of the total mileage of new railways built nationwide during the First Five-Year Plan. The completed bridges and culverts totaled 75,200 meters in length, and the tunnels totaled more than 13,880 meters.

　　In completing the above-mentioned engineering tasks, the vast numbers of officers, soldiers and workers of the Railway Corps conscientiously implemented the construction policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" in capital construction. Under the premise of ensuring the quality of construction, the officers and soldiers tried every means to use cheap wood, bamboo, and quarried stone along the line, as well as other measures to reduce costs, ensuring low project costs. The Litang-Zhanjiang Railway, which opened half a year ahead of schedule, saved the state more than 32.9 million yuan in investment during construction, and the project quality was excellent. During the construction of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, the Railway Corps laid the track to Xiamen one year ahead of schedule, and the investment saved for the country could be used to build one and a half Nanping-Fuzhou railways.

　　In the course of construction, the officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps accumulated relatively rich construction experience in the construction of new railways, and trained a large number of officers and soldiers with certain railway construction skills.

　　According to responsible persons of relevant departments, the Railway Corps will continue to undertake the construction tasks of ten new railway projects in 1958, and is scheduled to complete the track laying of 437 kilometers of new lines this year.

    铁道兵立下大功劳
    修建铁路近两千公里
    新华社4日讯　中国人民解放军铁道兵部队在第一个五年计划期间，为祖国的铁路建设事业做出了重大贡献，并在新建铁路的施工中锻炼成为一支有技术有经验的部队。铁道兵部队从1954年参加新的铁路建设工程以来，到1957年底，先后共参加新建和修复铁路干线、支线、专用线和大桥等工程达二十个项目，已铺轨通车的铁路达一千九百五十一公里，占第一个五年计划期间全国新建铁路总里程的47.7％；建成的桥梁涵洞共长七万五千二百公尺、隧道共一万三千八百八十多公尺。
    铁道兵广大官兵和职工在完成上述的工程任务中，认真地执行了在基本建设中贯彻多、快、好、省的建设方针，在保证施工质量的前提下，官兵们想尽种种办法利用沿线廉价的木料、竹材和开出的石料，以及其他降低造价的措施，保证了工程造价低廉。提前半年通车的黎塘—湛江铁路，在施工中为国家节约投资达三千二百九十多万元，而且工程质量优良。在修建鹰厦铁路时，铁道兵部队提前一年铺轨到厦门，为国家节省的投资可以用来修建一条半南平—福州铁路。
    铁道兵部队官兵们在施工中积累了比较丰富的新建铁路的施工经验，并培养了大批的具有一定铁路施工技术的官兵。
    据有关部门负责人说，铁道兵部队在1958年将继续担任新建铁路工程中十个项目的施工任务，预定今年完成四百三十七公里的新线铺轨任务。
