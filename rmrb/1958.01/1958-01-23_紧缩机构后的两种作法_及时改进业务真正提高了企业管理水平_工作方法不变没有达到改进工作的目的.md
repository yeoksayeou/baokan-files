Two Approaches After Streamlining Institutions
	Timely Improvement of Operations Truly Enhanced Enterprise Management Level; Unchanged Working Methods Failed to Achieve the Purpose of Improving Work

(Our Dispatch) After the streamlining of institutions in most of the local state-owned factories in Shenyang, the work has been basically completed. Generally, management personnel in factories have been reduced from 15% to 25% of the total number of employees in the past to below 10% of the total number of employees. After streamlining their institutions, many factories promptly improved their operations, enhanced the level of enterprise management, and promoted production. A small number of units, after establishing new institutions, failed to establish new systems and new working methods in a timely manner, causing work to fall into a state of chaos and stagnation.

After streamlining its institutions, the Shenyang No. 1 Machinery Factory immediately mobilized the masses to carry out business construction, made overall arrangements based on tasks and personnel, reduced unnecessary procedures, formulated reasonable systems, and improved working methods. As a result, the situation of "three more" becoming "three less" (more heads, more buck-passing, more meetings, becoming fewer people, less buck-passing, fewer meetings) and "three low" becoming "three high" (low business level, low work morale, low work efficiency, becoming high confidence, high morale, high efficiency) appeared. The factory's three major well-known buck-passing problems (buck-passing in accepting orders and arranging plans, buck-passing in executing contracts, and buck-passing in contract changes) have also been resolved, and the factory's management level has been greatly improved. In the Bottle Factory, after focusing on improving operations, the finance department used to have nine people, and monthly cost calculations could not be reported until the 25th or 26th of the following month. Now, it has been reduced to five people, but it is reported before the 15th. The warehouse used to be managed by three people, and material supply was not timely. Now, it is managed by one person, and not only is it timely, but he can also take time to deliver materials to the workshop. The Power Machinery Factory used to have more than 200 kinds of forms and reports, with more than 700 copies per month. Now, it has been reduced by 40 kinds, with only more than 200 copies per month. The Enamel Factory has also reduced the original more than 190 kinds of forms and reports to about 130 kinds. These factories have all shown a vigorous new situation, and the enthusiasm and work efficiency of the staff have been significantly improved.

Some factory leaders did not see the contradiction between the old working methods and the new institutions, and did not promptly grasp the mobilization of the masses to improve operations, which affected the normal progress of the work. For example, the Oil Felt Paper Factory originally had seven or eight sections and offices, which were merged into two sections: business management and administration. The leaders of this factory did not mobilize the masses to discuss relevant business issues before the merger of the institutions, and did not disclose the bottom line to middle-level cadres, so that the cadres were not fully prepared ideologically. After the merger of the institutions, they did not conduct a good study of the business, so there was a period of confusion in the work. Because the supply and marketing personnel were not stable in their thinking, the supply of oil felt base paper in December could not be supplied, causing a production team to stop work for four or five hours; at one time, even the commonly used kerosene and asphalt were almost not supplied. The Farm Implements Factory also failed to study and improve its operations well after the personnel were decentralized, so that some workshop planners missed the plan; the departments pushed the business to the workshops, and if the workshops could not do it, they asked the leaders for people. These phenomena are all detrimental to the work.

    紧缩机构后的两种作法
    及时改进业务真正提高了企业管理水平  工作方法不变没有达到改进工作的目的
    本报讯　沈阳市大部分地方国营工厂紧缩机构的工作已经基本结束。一般工厂管理人员由过去占职工总数的15％至25％，减少到占职工总数10％以下。许多工厂在紧缩机构以后，及时改进业务，提高了企业管理水平，推动了生产。少数单位在新机构建立起来以后，没有及时建立新的制度与新的工作方法，使工作陷于混乱和停顿的状态。
    沈阳市第一机械厂在紧缩机构以后，随即发动群众进行业务建设，根据任务和人员情况做通盘安排，减少不必要的手续，制订合理的制度，改进了工作方法，因之出现了“三多”变“三少”（头多、扯皮多、会议多，变成人少、扯皮少、会议少）、“三低”变“三高”（业务水平低、工作情绪低、工作效率低，变为信心高、情绪高、效率高）的局面。全厂有名的三大扯皮（承接订货安排计划上的扯皮，执行合同上的扯皮，合同变更上的扯皮）的问题也得到了解决，工厂管理水平有了很大的提高。制瓶厂在着重改进业务后，财务科过去九个人，每月成本计算要到下月25、26日才能报出，现在减为五个人，反而在15日前就报出去了。仓库过去由三个人管理，供料还不及时，现在一个人管，不仅及时了，还能抽出时间往车间送料。动力机械厂，过去表报有二百多种，每月有七百多份，现在减少四十种，每月仅二百多份。搪瓷厂也将过去一百九十多种表报，减到一百三十种左右。这些厂都出现了生气勃勃的新局面，工作人员的积极性与工作效率都有显著提高。
    有些工厂的领导方面没有看到旧工作方法与新机构间的矛盾，没有及时抓紧发动群众改进业务，因而影响了工作的正常进行。如油毡纸厂，原有七、八个股室，这次合并为经营管理和行政两个股。这个厂的领导人员对这么大的变革，在机构合并前没有发动群众讨论有关业务问题，没有向中层干部交底，使干部没有充分的思想准备；在机构合并以后，又没有对业务进行很好的研究，因此工作中一度发生混乱。由于供销人员思想不安定，12月份油毡原纸供应不上，使一个生产班停工四、五小时；有一个时候连常用的煤油和沥青也险些供应不上。农具厂也由于在人员下放以后，没有很好地研究改进业务，以致有的车间计划员漏排了计划；科室把业务往车间推，车间干不了便向领导要人。这些现象对工作都很不利。
