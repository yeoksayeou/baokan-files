Nandina

Zifan

In ancient Chinese folk mythology, it is said that when the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan cast cauldrons and the hundreds of gods of Nanhu received their duties in the East Sea, one god offered a plant that bore white fruit. Nüwa then used this white fruit to refine stones to mend the sky. When refining the stones, adding water would stop the flow, and raising wind would cease it. Xuanyuan cherished it greatly and ordered it to be transplanted in the imperial garden of the Penglai Immortal Island. The leaves of this plant are somewhat like bamboo leaves, and the fruit is as red as candles, so people call it Nandina (also known as Heavenly Candle, Nandina domestica, Eastern Nandina, and Heavenly Bamboo). In the early 19th century, this beautiful plant was transported to foreign lands by European and American missionaries and others, and they continued to use the old name "Heavenly Bamboo" or "Chinese Sacred Bamboo."

Nandina is native to the provinces of the Yangtze River basin in China, with more wild growth in the mountainous areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It thrives best in calcareous soil and on limestone. In the high mountains above 1,000 meters in the south and in the dry and cold regions of the north, even if there is suitable soil, it is usually difficult to find its footprints, due to climate.

Nandina growing in the open is only three to five feet tall, but old trees can reach over ten feet. Its leaves do not wither in winter, and it generally blooms with small white flowers in June and July, which are not very conspicuous but very dense. In winter, the branches are full of fruit like grapes, with dozens of berries on a bunch, swaying above the green leaves, able to withstand frost and snow without falling. The color of the fruit is bright red, purplish-red, and white.

Nandina prefers semi-shade and moist ground, but it does not grow well in overly shady and damp places, or it bears very little fruit. Dwarf trees bear more fruit, while taller trees bear less. Those planted in barren land must be fertilized near the roots to grow vigorously. The propagation method is generally to cut off the branches and trunks flush with the ground in autumn, and then divide and replant the root clumps. Alternatively, you can sow seeds in early spring, but the seedlings grow slowly, and it takes two or three years to enjoy the fruit.

In the cold climate of the north, Nandina is generally only grown in pots indoors. After the spring warms, move it outdoors to a place where the scorching sun cannot reach it, and fertilize and water it appropriately, and it can also bear abundant fruit. In the south, Nandina is one of the plants used for greening the surroundings. It can be planted on the sides of houses and villages, or as a green fence along roadsides and riverbanks. Its leaf color changes with the seasons, appearing light green in spring, emerald green in summer and autumn, and purplish-red in winter. When set against a snowy scene, the fruits and leaves appear even more vibrant and moving. In winter, cutting off its fruit spikes with leaves and inserting them into a vase for elegant display in the study or to decorate the New Year is not only elegant but also deeply evocative.

In addition to being ornamental, Nandina can also be used for medicinal purposes. Its fruit has a strong paralyzing effect and can suppress coughs and asthma. However, the dosage must be determined by a doctor to avoid excessive amounts causing convulsions and nerve paralysis. Using its leaves to decoct a soup to wash the eyes can remove wind-heat and swollenness, and the branches and stems can also treat wind-related diseases.

    南天竹
    紫帆
    在我国古代民间的神话里，传说轩辕黄帝铸鼎，南湖百神受职于东海时，一神献一种能结白色果实的植物，女娲氏便采用这白色果实来炼石补天。炼石时，加水水断流，举风风停息，轩辕很珍奇，下令把它移栽在蓬莱仙岛的御花园里。这种植物的叶子有些像竹叶，果实红艳如烛，所以世人就称它为南天竹，（又叫南天烛、南天竺、东天竺和天竺）。十九世纪初，这种美丽的植物被欧美传教士等运到异乡，仍沿用旧名称它为天竹或中国神竹。
    南天竹原产我国长江流域各省，以江浙一带山地野生较多。它最喜欢在石灰性土壤和石灰岩上生长。在南方一千公尺以上的高山和北方干冷的地区，即使有适宜的土壤，通常也找不到它的足迹，这是因为气候的关系。
    露地生长的南天竹不过三、五尺高，但老树也有达一丈开外的。它的叶子经冬不雕，一般六、七月开碎白花，不十分显著，但很繁密。冬季，枝头结实累累如葡萄，一穗有果数十粒，扶摇绿叶之上，能耐霜雪而不落。果实的颜色有鲜红、紫红和白色。
    南天竹性喜半阴和湿润地，但过分阴湿处又生长不良或结实很少。树身矮小的结实较多，树身高的反而结实较少。凡栽在瘠薄地上的，须在根旁施肥才能生长旺盛。繁殖方法一般是在秋季齐地剪去枝干，再将根丛分栽。另外还可在早春播种，不过幼苗生长缓慢，要想赏果非经二、三年不可。
    北方气候寒冷，南天竹一般只作室内盆栽。春暖后移放室外烈日晒不到的地方，平时适当施肥和浇水，亦可结实丰富。在南方，南天竹是绿化四旁的植物之一。可栽在屋侧和村旁，也可作为路旁和河岸的绿色篱笆。它的叶色随季节而变换，春季呈淡绿色，夏秋呈翠绿色，冬季呈紫红色。如衬上雪景，则果实和叶子更觉鲜艳动人。冬季里，将它的果穗带叶剪下插瓶，供书舍清玩或点缀年景，不但高雅而且情趣深长。
    南天竹除供观赏外，还可供药用。它的果实有强烈的麻痹作用，可抑制咳嗽和气喘。但用量必须求医，以免过量引起痉癴和神经麻痹。用它的叶子煎汤洗眼，能去风火、热肿等疾，枝茎还可治风疾。
