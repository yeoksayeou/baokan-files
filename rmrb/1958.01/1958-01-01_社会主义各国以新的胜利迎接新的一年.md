    Socialist Countries Greet the New Year with New Victories
    ·Soviet Union·
    Important Industrial Annual Plan Completed Ahead of Schedule
    The Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union announced on December 27 and 28 that the Soviet industrial sector had completed the annual plans for oil and coal extraction, as well as the production plans for the most important non-ferrous metals, mineral fertilizers, caustic soda, and soda ash ahead of schedule in 1957. The annual plans for railway transportation and shipping were also completed ahead of schedule on December 20 and 18, respectively.
    In the light industry sector, workers and staff throughout the Soviet Union have completed the annual production plans for cotton fabrics, wool fabrics, silk fabrics, linen fabrics, leather shoes, and other products ahead of schedule in 1957, and can overproduce nearly 100 million meters of textiles and 6 million pairs of leather shoes.
    In addition, the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan have also completed their 1957 industrial production plans ahead of schedule.
    According to an announcement by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation on December 28, the 1957 industrial production of this largest republic of the Soviet Union increased by 10% compared to 1956. In the first eleven months of 1957, the republic's coal mining increased by 18 million tons and oil extraction increased by 12 million tons compared to the same period in 1956. Over the year, the machine-building industry of the Russian Federation produced many new products.
    Due to the achievements made in developing heavy industry and agriculture, the production of consumer goods in the Russian Federation has also increased.
    ·Czechoslovakia·
    Coal Production Last Year More Than Doubled Pre-War Levels
    Czechoslovakia's coal miners completed the 1957 annual coal mining plan ahead of schedule on December 27, having extracted a total of 75,375,800 tons of coal by that date. This figure is more than 5 million tons higher than the actual output in 1956, nearly 50% higher than the coal mining volume in 1948, and more than double the pre-war 1937 level.
    Currently, the mechanization of coal mining in Czechoslovakia is continuously developing. The Czechoslovak industrial sector has produced the first batch of coal mining combines for inclined and steep coal seam working faces. Thin coal seams that were previously impossible to mine by machine are now also being successfully mined by machine.
    ·Mongolia·
    The Second Five-Year Plan Has Been Successfully Completed
    An official from the Mongolian State Planning Commission told a Xinhua News Agency reporter on December 31 that 1957 was the final year of Mongolia's Second Five-Year Plan, and it is expected that the total industrial output value of the Second Five-Year Plan can be completed at 115%.
    The output of major industrial products has greatly increased. Compared with 1957 and 1952, electricity will increase 7.3 times, bricks will increase 5 times, leather will increase 0.7 to 2.4 times, felt will increase 0.83 times, and coal, meat, and other building materials will also increase.
    The Second Five-Year Plan stipulated a 24% increase in labor productivity, which had already increased by 29% in the first four years of the plan's implementation.
    The average wages and actual income of workers in the first four years exceeded the targets set by the Five-Year Plan.
    ·Vietnam·
    Year-End Competition Has Achieved Great Success
    The year-end production competition movement of workers and farmers in North Vietnam has achieved great success.
    In order to strive to complete the post-war three-year economic recovery plan by the end of 1957, the workers and staff of various factories, mines, enterprises, and construction sites in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have launched production competitions among individuals, groups, or workshops since the beginning of winter. According to materials from the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry: the Electricity Bureau under the ministry has completed the 1957 annual production plan one month ahead of schedule, the Hanoi Ice Factory completed the annual plan one month and five days ahead of schedule, and the Hongji Coal Mine's Oxygen Plant also exceeded the annual plan by 2.26% on December 4.
    The farmers of North Vietnam are also not to be outdone. According to the Vietnam News Agency: the farmers in the provinces of Thai Binh, Hai Duong, and Kien An in the Red River Left Bank region, while rushing to harvest the late rice, have launched a plowing competition with the slogan "Strive to break the highest record of this year's summer rice harvest next year." Farmers, in mutual aid teams or as individuals, are taking the high-yield groups or individuals of the 1957 summer rice in their provinces as their goals, striving to create higher records. In Thai Binh province, 69 mutual aid teams and 752 farmers have already participated in the competition. Du Van Thuan, a farmer from Kien An province who created the highest record of late rice yield in the Red River Left Bank region in 1956, has also joined the competition. In the mountainous regions of Viet Bac, many mutual aid teams and farmers in Phu Tho province are taking the Li Daye Mutual Aid Team, which had high-yield summer rice in Lintao County in 1957, Tie Daye, a model worker from Thanh Ba County, and the Xuan Huy Agricultural Production Cooperative as their goals, conducting challenge competitions. This movement is also continuing to unfold in other provinces and regions.
    ·German Democratic Republic·
    Many Enterprises Complete Production Plans Ahead of Schedule
    Workers in many enterprises in the German Democratic Republic are greeting the New Year by completing their production plans ahead of schedule.
    The brown coal industry of the German Democratic Republic completed its annual plan for the production of brown coal briquettes on December 27. The workers and engineers of the Senftenberg coal mining area achieved great success, increasing the production of brown coal briquettes by 430,000 tons this year. A total of 1.5 million tons of brown coal briquettes were produced nationwide.
    The largest chemical factory in the German Democratic Republic, the Leuna factory, also completed its 1957 plan ahead of schedule.
    Workers at the Zeiss factory in Jena completed their annual plan five days ahead of schedule.
    Enterprises that completed their annual plans ahead of schedule also include the Berlin Cable Factory, the Rüdersdorf Chemical Factory, and the Zella-Mehlis Ball Bearing Factory, among others.
    ·Korea·
    Metallurgical, Coal, and Other Enterprises All Achieved Overproduction
    Korean industry achieved rapid development in 1957. As early as the end of November 1957, Korean industry had completed its plan ahead of schedule in terms of total output value. By the end of 1957, important industrial sectors such as metallurgy, coal, electricity, and chemicals, as well as the light industry sector, not only completed the 1957 production plans ahead of schedule but also completed additional production plans.
    The development of Korean industry shows that Korean industry has fundamentally healed the wounds of war and embarked on a new path of development.

    社会主义各国以新的胜利迎接新的一年
    ·苏联·
    重要工业年度计划提前完成
    苏联部长会议中央统计局在12月27日和28日先后宣布，苏联工业部门已经提前完成了1957年全年的石油和煤的开采计划以及最重要的有色金属、矿物肥料、苛性钠和烧碱的生产计划。铁路运输和海运的年度计划也分别在12月20日和18日提前完成。
    在轻工业部门，苏联全国职工已经提前完成了1957年棉织品、毛织品、丝织品、麻织品、皮鞋和其他产品的全年生产计划，并且可以超额生产近一亿公尺纺织品和六百万双皮鞋。
    此外，俄罗斯联邦、哈萨克和塔吉克共和国也先后提前完成了1957年的工业生产计划。
    据俄罗斯联邦部长会议中央统计局12月28日宣布，这个苏联最大的加盟共和国1957年的工业生产比1956年增加了10％。在1957年头十一个月中，共和国的采煤量比1956年同期增加了一千八百万吨、开采的石油增加了一千二百万吨。一年来，俄罗斯联邦的机器制造工业生产了许多新产品。
    由于在发展重工业和农业方面所取得的成就，俄罗斯联邦的消费品生产也增加了。
    ·捷克斯洛伐克·
    去年煤产量超过战前一倍多
    捷克斯洛伐克的煤矿工人已经在12月27日提前完成了1957年度的采煤计划，到这天为止共开采了七千五百三十七万五千八百多吨煤。这个数字比1956年的实际产量多五百多万吨，比1948年的采煤量增加近50％，比战前1937年增加了一倍多。
    现在，捷克斯洛伐克采煤工作的机械化正在不断发展。捷克斯洛伐克工业部门已经生产出第一批用于倾斜煤层和陡立煤层工作面的采煤联合机。过去完全不能用机器开采的薄煤层现在也在成功地用机器开采了。
    ·蒙古·
    第二个五年计划已胜利完成
    蒙古国家计划委员会的一位负责人12月31日对新华社记者说，1957年是蒙古第二个五年计划的最后一年，预计第二个五年计划的工业总产值可以完成115％。
    主要工业品的产量有了很大提高。以1957年和1952年相比，电力将增加七点三倍，砖将增加五倍，皮革将增加零点七倍到二点四倍，毡子将增加零点八三倍，煤、肉类和其他建筑材料等都将有所增加。
    第二个五年计划规定要提高劳动生产率24％，在执行计划的头四年就已经提高了29％。
    工人的平均工资和实际收入在头四年就超过了五年计划所规定的指标。
    ·越南·
    年终竞赛已经取得很大成就
    越南北方的工人和农民的年终生产竞赛运动已取得很大成绩。
    为了争取在1957年年底前完成战后三年恢复经济计划，越南民主共和国各工厂、矿山、企业以及建设工地的职工们，入冬以来纷纷开展个人之间、小组之间或者车间之间的生产竞赛。据越南工业部材料：该部所属的电力局已经提前一个月完成了1957年全年生产计划，河内制冰厂提前一个月零五天完成全年计划，鸿基煤矿的氧气厂也在12月4日超额2.26％完成全年计划。
    越南北方的农民们也并不示弱，据越南通讯社消息：红河左岸地区的太平、海阳、建安等省农民，一面抢收晚稻，一面发起耕作竞赛，他们的口号是“争取明年夏稻打破今年夏稻收成的最高纪录”。农民们以互助变工小组或以个人为单位，以本省1957年夏稻高产组或个人作目标，争取创造更高的纪录。太平省已经有六十九个互助变工小组以及七百五十二个农民参加了竞赛。曾经创造1956年红河左岸地区晚稻产量最高纪录的建安省农民杜文顺，也投身到竞赛行列里来了。而越北山区福寿省许多互助变工组和农民，则以临洮县1957年夏稻高产的力大爷互助变工组、清波县的劳模铁大爷以及春辉农业生产合作社为目标，进行挑战竞赛。这个运动也正在其他省区继续开展起来。
    ·民主德国·
    许多企业提前完成生产计划
    德意志民主共和国许多企业的劳动者用提前完成生产计划来迎接新年。
    民主德国褐煤工业在12月27日就完成了生产褐煤砖的年度计划。申夫登贝格采煤区的工人和工程技术人员获得了巨大的成就，他们在今年增产褐煤砖四十三万吨。全国一共增产了一百五十万吨褐煤砖。
    民主德国最大的化学工厂——洛伊纳工厂也提前完成了1957年的计划。
    耶纳的蔡斯工厂的工人提前五天完成了全年计划。
    提前完成年度计划的企业还有柏林电缆厂、鲁德尔斯多尔夫化学工厂、柴拉—麦利斯滚珠轴承厂等。
    ·朝鲜·
    冶金煤炭等企业都超额增产
    朝鲜工业1957年获得了迅速的发展。早在1957年11月底，朝鲜工业在总产值方面就提前完成了计划。到1957年年底为止，冶金、煤炭、电力和化学等重要工业部门以及轻工业部门，不仅提前完成了1957年的生产计划，并且完成了附加的增产计划。
    朝鲜工业发展的情况表明，朝鲜的工业已经从根本上治好了战争的创伤，并且走上了新的发展道路。
