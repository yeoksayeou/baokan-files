    Making a Small Desk with Matchboxes

    Many people often throw away used matchboxes. If they could be used to make toys, children would definitely like them. Matchboxes can be used to make small cars, small desks (see attached picture), bedside tables, sofas, small beds, and so on. These toys are very simple to make, and if you paste a layer of colored paper on the finished furniture, it will be even more beautiful. (Sucun)

    用火柴盒做小书桌
    许多人家往往把用过的火柴盒扔掉了。如果能用它做玩具，孩子们一定很喜欢。用火柴盒可以做小汽车、小书桌（见附图）、床头柜、沙发椅、小床等等。这种玩具，做起来非常简单，如果用彩色纸在做好的家具上糊一层，那就更漂亮了。　（素纯）
