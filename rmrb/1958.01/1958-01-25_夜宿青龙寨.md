    Overnight Stay at Qinglong Village
    Jin Fantian
    Deep winter, the Xishuangbanna mountains are still a patch of brownish-green. At dusk, milky white mist rises from the坝子里 (坝子里, a local word for valley or flatland), like a sea tide, submerging the valley fields, the roofs of Dai houses, and the mountains; the green mountains turn into islands of all sizes, standing in the vast sea of fog. …
    I went to the city to find Comrade Liu Qun from the county party committee to understand the situation. To save time, I had to hurry on with some night travel. Comrade Liu Qun used to be a political instructor in the army and was transferred to civilian work in 1952. I had never met him. Before leaving, the battalion commander introduced his situation to me: "Medium height, over forty years old, a calm face, a pair of thoughtful eyes hidden beneath his glasses…."
    The night seemed particularly calm. The sky was deep and vast. The road was like a white tire, leading me into the distance. Soon, I arrived at a village. Suddenly someone asked, "Who is it?"
    "Me, a soldier of the People's Liberation Army!" I said.
    After the militiaman checked my credentials, I asked to stay overnight in their village.
    "It's not possible. General village rules don't allow overnight stays. Qinglong Village is ahead; go to the township people's committee to stay!"
    …At the end of the bamboo forest, a patch of thatched huts came into view. I was extremely happy and walked towards a house with lights on. People were holding a meeting. The person who spoke to me was a middle-aged Dai man. From the introduction, I learned he was the township party secretary. After he checked my credentials, he replied readily: "Okay, but there's not much to offer."
    I quickly said, "A place to sleep is enough."
    "We have that!" he said, then asked with concern, "Comrade, have you eaten yet?"
    I said frankly, "No."
    "That's good, we'll eat together later!" He handed me a cup of hot tea. Only then did I have time to look around the room. Suddenly, I saw a middle-aged man in a Zhongshan suit sitting across from the secretary, searching through a notebook, as if nothing had happened in the room. Only when the secretary spoke did he look up, his eyes falling on an old man. His expression seemed to say, "Continue!"
    The old man quickly said, "Our cooperative has fifty-one head of draught cattle."
    "We have thirty-seven!" another said.
    "We…"
    The middle-aged man flicked the abacus beads, and after finishing, he copied the numbers into his notebook, saying with a smile and satisfaction, "Hmm! The livestock power is just enough!" Then he asked, "What about fertilizer?" So, the old men began their滔滔不绝 (tāotāo bùjué, a stream of eloquent talk) narration. What they said, calculated, and wrote about were all about draught cattle, cow dung, oxcarts…in short, every sentence was inseparable from cattle.
    "Okay, another task completed, let's calculate fertilizer!" the middle-aged man said with vigor.
    "Oh, it's one o'clock!" The secretary looked at me and said, "This comrade is still waiting for us!"
    "Then take care of this comrade, let's eat before continuing!" the middle-aged man said.
    After eating, the secretary made a bed for me, saying, "Comrade, you're tired, rest first!"
    I lay on the soft bamboo bed, and through the sparse bamboo fence, the office was brightly lit, the scratching of the pen on paper and the clicking of abacus beads mixing together. But none of this affected me, and I soon fell asleep…
    Suddenly, a burst of噼噼啪啪 (pīpīpāpā, crackling sounds) gunfire and the explosion of a shell woke me up. I looked up and the room was pitch black, with dogs barking loudly outside. I quickly grabbed my gun, opened the door, the sky was covered with dark clouds, and the earth seemed particularly gloomy. "What happened? Where did they go?" I thought as I followed the small path in the forest towards the barking. Suddenly, light appeared ahead, along with the noise of voices and the heavy footsteps of animals…. I recognized a familiar voice and greeted him, calling out happily, "Secretary!"
    "Comrade Jin!" The secretary was both surprised and happy, and he grabbed my hand, asking, "How did you get here too?"
    "What happened?" I asked.
    "Look!" He said excitedly, "We caught two people and five cattle."
    "Who are they?" I asked.
    "They are cattle peddlers trying to smuggle the cattle out of the mountains to slaughter and sell at a high price."
    Because of catching the cattle peddlers, the middle-aged man suffered a slight head injury. Back at home, as we bandaged him, the secretary told me about the incident. Finally, he glanced at the middle-aged man, and with eyes full of admiration and respect, he said to me, "Those who have been scouts are really something. They can catch special agents and also catch smugglers!"
    I quickly walked to the "scout" and, emboldened, asked with respect, "Are you Comrade Liu Qun?"
    He looked at me, smiled, and said, "Yes!"
    "I came to find you!"
    "I didn't expect to meet so coincidentally," he joked, asking, "What's the matter?"
    "I'm from the Second Regiment, and I wanted to ask you about the situation."
    "Second Regiment?" He looked at me and said, "Then tell me!"
    Only then did I clearly see that his forehead was covered with wrinkles, and bloodshot veins like a spider web surrounded his black eyeballs, and the gauze was gradually soaked with spots of blood…
    "Chief, let's rest for a while and then talk!" I regretted why I was disturbing him at this time.
    "Oh! Six twenty, not much sleep to be had anyway!" He looked at his watch and said, grabbing my hand excitedly, looking me up and down: "To be honest, being transferred to local work is like a girl getting married. Seeing you makes me so happy! Little Jin, hurry up, talk about what you want to know, I also want to know something about my family!"

    夜宿青龙寨
    金帆田
    深冬，西双版纳山区依然一片褐绿色，傍晚，坝子里升起了乳白色的雾气，像海潮似的，淹没了谷田、傣家的舍顶和山谷；绿色的群山，变成了大大小小的岛群，屹立在白茫茫的雾海里。……
    我到城里找县委刘群同志了解情况。为了抓紧时间，所以得赶点夜路。刘群同志过去是部队的教导员，1952年才转业下去的。我没有见过他，临走的时候，营长把他的情况，向我介绍了一遍：“中等个儿、四十开外的年纪、沉静的面孔，眼镜下面藏着一对深思的眼睛……。”
    夜，显得格外平静。天空，深远而辽阔。路像是一条白色的轮带，把我引向远方。不久，到了一个寨子。忽然有人问道：“谁？”
    “我，解放军！”我说。
    民兵看过证明之后，我要求在他们寨子里宿一夜。
    “不行啦，一般村子规定不能留宿，前面就是青龙寨，你到乡人民委员会住去吧！”
    ……竹林尽头，露出了一片茅屋，我高兴极了，朝着一间点着灯的屋子走去，人们正在开会，和我说话的是一位傣族中年人，从介绍中我知道他是乡支书，他看过证明之后，满口回答：“可以，就是没什么招待的。”
    我连忙说：“有个地方睡就行了。”
    “那有！”他说完，又关心地问：“同志，你吃饭了没有？”
    我照直说：“没有。”
    “那好，等会我们一起吃吧！”他递给我一杯热茶。这时，我才有空把屋子里瞧一遍，猛然，看见支书对面坐着一位穿中山服的中年人正在笔记本上寻觅着，好像屋子里从未发生过什么事情。直等支书说话，他才抬起头，眼光落在一位老人身上。意思好像说：“继续说吧！”
    老人连忙说：“我们社有五十一头耕牛。”
    “我们有三十七头！”另一个说。
    “我们……”
    那个中年人弹动着算盘珠子，打完后又把这些数字抄在笔记本上，带着微笑，满意的说：“嗯！畜力刚刚够用！”接着问：“肥料呢？”于是，老人们又开始了滔滔不绝的叙述。他们说的、算的、写的，都是耕牛、牛粪、牛车……总之，句句离不开牛。
    “好啦，又完成了一项，那我们来计算肥料吧！”中年人精神饱满的说。
    “哟，一点钟了！”支书把我看了看，说：“这位同志还等着我们哩！”
    “那就照顾照顾这位同志，吃了饭再干吧！”中年人说。
    吃完饭，支书给我铺好床，交代说：“同志，你累了，先休息吧！”
    我躺在软绵绵的竹床上，透过稀得像耙齿的竹篱，办公室里灯光通明，笔尖在纸上喳喳声和算盘珠子的哒哒声混合在一起。但是，这些都没有影响我，不久我就入睡了。……
    忽然一阵噼噼啪啪的枪声和一颗炮弹的爆炸声，把我惊醒了。抬头一看，屋里漆黑，外面吠声汪汪。我赶紧提着枪，开开门，天空铺满了乌云，大地显得格外阴暗。“出了什么事？他们到哪里去了呢？”我一面想，一面顺着林中小路向狗吠的方向走去。忽然，前面出现了光亮，嘈杂的话声，动物沉重的脚步声……。我听出一个熟悉的声音，迎上去，高兴的叫：“支书！”
    “金同志！”支书又惊又喜，握住我的手问“你怎么也来啦？”
    “出了什么事？”我问。
    “你看！”他兴奋的说，“抓住了两个人，五头牛。”
    “什么人？”我问。
    “是牛贩子，想把牛贩到山外去杀了卖大价钱。”
    因为抓牛贩子，那中年人头受了点轻伤，回到家里，我们一面替他包扎，支书一面向我叙说着这件事情的经过。最后，他瞟了那中年人一眼，含着既羡慕又尊敬的眼光对我说：“当过侦察员的就是行，能抓特务，也能抓走私犯！”
    我连忙走到这位“侦察员”的面前，放大胆子，带着尊敬的口气问：“你就是刘群同志吗？”
    他看看我，笑了笑说：“是呀！”
    “我正是去找你的哩！”
    “想不到碰得这么巧，”他打趣地问：“有什么事？”
    “我是二团来的，想找你了解点情况。”
    “二团？”他看看我，说：“那你说吧！”
    这时，我才清楚地看到，他的额前堆满了皱纹，像蛛网似的血丝丝包着两颗黑眼珠子，纱布上渐渐地浸湿了点点血迹……
    “首长，休息一会再谈吧！”我后悔为什么在这个时候又来打扰他。
    “哟！六点二十分，也睡不成什么了！”他看看表说，激动地抓住我的手，上下打量一遍：“说实话，转业到地方上来，就好像姑娘出了嫁一样，见了你们，叫我怎能不喜欢呢！小金，抓紧时间，谈完你要了解的问题，我还想了解一点娘家的情况哩！”
