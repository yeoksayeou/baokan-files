　　New Technology, New Products
　　Good Medicine for Fly Control
　　The Shanghai Agricultural Pharmaceutical Machinery Factory's pharmaceutical workshop laboratory recently successfully tested four new pesticides: Ximeituo, Fly Poison Sand, Luludaibenzene, and Wuclonitrobenzene.
　　Ximeituo is a new pesticide with immunity properties that prevents cotton budworm damage.
　　Fly Poison Sand is a special medicine for killing flies. It is made by mixing dipterex, sand, and second-grade molasses. Fifty grams of Fly Poison Sand can kill tens of thousands of flies in a few days, and the cost is estimated to be only about one jiao RMB.
　　Luludaibenzene is a fungicide that can be used to eliminate wheat smut disease. Wuclonitrobenzene is effective against cotton seedling diseases.
　　"Oak Acorn Cups" Can Be Used for Leather Making
　　The jointly owned public-private Hainin Leather Factory in Hainin County, Zhejiang Province, has successfully tested the use of locally produced "oak acorn cups" mixed with imported tanning extract to manufacture leather, and it fully meets quality requirements. This year, the factory will use one-half oak acorn cups to replace imported tanning extract.
　　Oak acorn cups are the outer shells of the fruit of the wild plant, the cork oak.
　　Good Method for Drilling Hard Rock Layers
　　Long Xuhui, the leader of the 122nd Drilling Team, and Sheng Chaoxing, the drilling foreman of the corps, who were drilling the Ma Po tunnel section of the Xiangqian Railway (Duyun to Guiyang), recently proposed using internal combustion engine exhaust as "air pressure dry drilling." They successfully overcame the difficulties encountered by geological drilling personnel when performing dry drilling in hard rock layers, such as high heat generation in the drilling tools, proneness to accidents, little pure drilling time, and slow progress.
　　Test results showed that using the "air pressure dry drilling method," the average drilling progress in Class 4 rock was 2.2 meters per shift, with a maximum of 3.6 meters. The drilling efficiency increased by about ten times compared to the original progress of this group, the working time utilization rate increased by about 25%, and the drilling quality fully met the requirements. In addition, drilling in water-scarce areas will reduce the large costs of carrying water to supply the drilling rig.

    新技术　新产品
    毒蝇除虫良药
    上海农业药械厂制药车间实验室，最近试验成功西梅脱、毒蝇砂、陆氯代苯、五氯硝基苯等四种新农药。
    西梅脱是一种带免疫性的防止棉芽出虫害的新农药。
    毒蝇砂是一种灭蝇特效药。它是用敌百虫和砂子、次蜜糖等混合而成的。用五十克毒蝇砂可以在几天内毒死几万只苍蝇，而成本估计只需人民币一角左右。
    陆氯代苯是一种杀菌剂，可用来消灭小麦黑穗病的病害。五氯硝基苯对棉苗苗期病害有特效。
    “橡碗子”可以用于制革
    浙江海宁县公私合营海宁制革厂，用山区土产“橡碗子”同进口栲胶混合使用制造皮革，已试验成功，并且完全符合质量要求。今年，这个厂将用二分之一的橡碗子来代替进口拷胶。
    橡碗子是一种野生植物麻栎果的外壳。
    钻探坚硬岩层的好办法
    在湘黔铁路都（匀）筑（贵阳）段马坡隧道施钻的第一二二钻探机组长龙旭辉和总队钻探工长盛超星，最近创议利用内燃机排气作“风压干钻”，成功地克服了地质钻探人员对坚硬岩层施行干钻时所遇到的如钻具发生高热、容易发生事故、纯钻进时间少、进度慢等困难。
   试验结果证明，采用“风压干钻法”，在四级岩石中，每班平均钻进二点二公尺，最高达三点六公尺，钻进效率比这个组原来的进度提高了十倍左右，工时利用率提高约25％，钻探质量完全符合要求，并且在缺水区钻探，将减少大量的挑水供钻机用的费用。
