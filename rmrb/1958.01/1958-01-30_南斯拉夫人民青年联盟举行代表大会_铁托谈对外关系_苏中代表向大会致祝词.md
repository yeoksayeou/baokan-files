    Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, January 28th: The Sixth Congress of the Yugoslav People's Youth League opened here on the 27th.
    At the first day's meeting, Tito delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Speaking on Yugoslavia's foreign relations, he said that one of Yugoslavia's main goals is to become an independent and autonomous country as soon as possible, without relying on any foreign country. Tito said that in line with this policy, Yugoslavia recently stopped accepting the military aid given to us. Tito emphasized that today we have enough strength to achieve our goals.
    Tito also talked about a series of hostile propaganda from Western countries against Yugoslavia. He specifically mentioned the illegal interception of the Yugoslav merchant ship "Slovenia" by France and the rumors spread by Western newspapers about this incident. Tito declared that no weapons were being smuggled to Algeria. He said that Yugoslavia opposes colonialism and sympathizes with all colonial peoples who hope to be liberated and become masters of their own destiny. However, we have not done anything that would make us liable from a legal or other point of view.
    At the meetings on the 27th and 28th, the Soviet and Chinese delegations delivered congratulatory speeches. Representatives of youth organizations from a total of twenty-two countries were invited to attend the congress. Semyon Pavlovich, Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, said in his congratulatory speech that Soviet youth respect the glorious traditions of struggle and labor of Yugoslav youth, and respect their achievements in building socialism and striving for world peace.
    Zhang Shuguang, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, said in his congratulatory speech: Chinese youth, like the entire Chinese people, have been closely watching the labor and struggle of the Yugoslav people and youth. We are pleased to see the achievements of the Yugoslav youth and the People's Youth League. In recent years, the friendship between the youth of our two countries has greatly developed. The friendship between us is based on the ideological foundation of Marxism-Leninism and the common goal of building socialism, and it is based on the great goals of opposing imperialist war adventures, defending world peace, supporting oppressed nations in their struggle for national independence, and opposing colonialism. In these common struggles, we will always support and learn from each other.
    Zhang Shuguang also introduced to the congress the struggles and tasks of Chinese youth in the revolution and socialist construction.

    铁托还谈到了西方国家对南斯拉夫的一系列敌视宣传。他特别提到南斯拉夫商船“斯洛文尼亚号”被法国非法拦截和西方报刊关于这一事件所散播的谣言。铁托声明没有私运任何武器给阿尔及利亚。他说，南斯拉夫反对殖民主义，同情一切希望获得解放和成为自己命运的主人的殖民地人民。但是，我们没有做过任何从法律观点或从其他观点使我们受到责难的事情。
    在27日和28日的会议上，苏联和中国的代表团致祝词。应邀出席这次大会的一共有二十二个国家的青年组织的代表。苏联共产主义青年团中央委员会书记谢米恰斯内伊在祝词中说，苏联青年尊重南斯拉夫青年进行的光荣斗争和劳动的传统，并且尊重他们在建设社会主义和争取世界和平斗争中所取得的成就。
    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会常务委员张曙光致祝词说：中国青年和全中国人民一样，一直关切地注视着南斯拉夫人民和青年的劳动和斗争。我们高兴地看到了南斯拉夫青年和人民青年联盟的成就。近几年来，我们两国青年之间的友谊有了很大的发展。我们之间的友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义思想基础和建设社会主义的共同目标上的，是建立在反对帝国主义战争冒险、保卫世界和平、支持被压迫民族争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争的伟大目标上的。在这些共同斗争中，我们将永远互相支持和互相学习。
