Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 20th: (By our correspondent Yang Yi) The two major ethnic groups in Czechoslovakia—the Czech and Slovak peoples—under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government, have embodied the spirit of brotherly unity and mutual assistance and implemented the principle of national equality in changing the backwardness of the Slovak region.

Statistical materials show that in the thirteen years since liberation, the total industrial output value of the Slovak region, where the Slovak people live, has increased fivefold, and the proportion of industry to agriculture has changed from three to seven before liberation to seven to three at present. Socialist elements in agriculture have already taken the upper hand, owning 54% of the total cultivated land area. The number of university students has increased fifty times compared with before liberation.

In the early days of liberation, Slovakia lagged far behind the Czech region in both economic and cultural aspects. This was due to the heavy oppression and exploitation suffered by the Slovak region from foreign rulers and domestic bourgeoisie over a long period. After liberation, the Czechoslovak Party and government, based on the principles of national equality and unity and mutual assistance and taking into account the characteristics of the Slovak nation, adopted a series of measures to help the development of the Slovak region. The Party and the government created conditions to enable Slovakia's economy to develop faster than the Czech region. For example, during the period from 1948 to 1956, Czechoslovakia's national industrial production increased by one and a half times, while the industrial production in the Slovak region increased by more than two times.

In the process of economic development, the Party and the government provided Slovakia's industrialization with huge financial, material, and human resource support. The state's funds for basic construction in Slovakia greatly exceeded the value provided by Slovakia in the national income. During the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), Slovakia's investment in basic construction will account for 27% of the country's total, while its total industrial output value will only account for 18% of the country's total during the same period. Slovakia's personal consumption increased by 90.5% between 1949 and 1956, while the national increase was 64.4%.

A total of more than 300 new and expanded industrial enterprises have been built in the Slovak region since liberation. In this process, experts and technicians from the Czech region have played an extremely important role, from designing, supplying, and installing machinery and equipment to organizing production, imparting technology, and preparing cadres. 90% of the machinery and equipment needed for the important industrial enterprises to be built in Slovakia, such as the Slovak oil refinery, the man-made fiber factory, and the Danube Power Plant, will be provided by factories in the Czech region. With the help of the Czech nation, agricultural production in the Slovak region has increased by one-third since liberation and will approach the level of the Czech region by 1960.

Brief information
    Of the more than 13 million people in Czechoslovakia, Czechs account for 65% of the total; Slovaks account for 28.7% of the total, with a population of about 4 million. Of the country's nineteen states, the Czech region has thirteen states and the Slovak region has six states. In 1948, the proportion of industry to agriculture in Slovakia's national economy was one to one, now it is approximately 70% to 30%. On average, eighty-seven out of every thousand residents participate in industrial production.

    在共产党的领导下贯彻民族平等政策
    捷克和斯洛伐克两民族团结互助
    斯洛伐克地区的落后面貌正在迅速改变
    新华社布拉格20日电　本社记者杨翊报道，捷克斯洛伐克的两个主要民族——捷克民族和斯洛伐克民族，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府的领导下，在改变斯洛伐克地区的落后面貌中，体现了兄弟团结互助的精神，贯彻了民族平等的政策原则。
    统计材料表明，在解放以来的十三年中，斯洛伐克民族聚居的斯洛伐克地区的工业总产值增加了五倍，工农业生产的比重由解放前的三比七变为目前的七比三。农业中的社会主义成分已经占了优势，拥有全部耕地面积的54％。大学生人数已经增加到解放前的五十倍。
    解放初期，斯洛伐克无论在经济和文化方面都远远落后于捷克地区，这是由于斯洛伐克地区在长时期里遭受着外国统治者和本国资产阶级的重重压榨和剥削。解放以后，捷克斯洛伐克党和政府根据民族平等和团结互助的原则并照顾到斯洛伐克民族的特点，采取了一系列的措施来帮助斯洛伐克地区的发展。党和政府创造条件使斯洛伐克的经济发展得比捷克地区更快。例如，在1948年—1956年期间，捷克斯洛伐克全国工业生产增加了一倍半，而斯洛伐克地区的工业生产增加了两倍多。
    在发展经济的过程中，党和政府给予斯洛伐克工业化以巨大的财政、物资和人材方面的支援。国家用于斯洛伐克基本建设的资金大大超过了斯洛伐克在全国国民收入中所提供的价值。在第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）期间，斯洛伐克的基本建设投资将占到全国的27％，而同一期间内它的工业总产值将只占全国的18％。斯洛伐克个人消费在1949到1956年间，提高了90.5％，而全国范围却是增加64.4％。
    斯洛伐克地区在解放后总共新建和扩建了三百多个工业企业。在这个过程中，从设计、供应和安装机器设备到组织生产、传授技术和准备干部，捷克地区的专家和技术工人都起了极其重大的作用。将要兴建的斯洛伐克炼油工厂、人造纤维工厂、多瑙河电力厂等重要工业企业所需的机器设备，90％都由捷克地区的工厂来提供。在捷克民族的帮助下，斯洛伐克地区的农业生产在解放后增长了三分之一，到1960年时就将接近捷克地区的水平。
    小资料
    在捷克斯洛伐克全国一千三百多万人口中，捷克族占总数的65％；斯洛伐克族占总数的28.7％，人口约四百万。在全国十九个州中，捷克区十三个州，斯洛伐克区六个州。1948年，斯洛伐克国民经济中工农业的比例是一比一，现在是大约70％比30％。每一千个居民中，平均有八十七人参加工业生产。
