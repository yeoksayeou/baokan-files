Reported by the Liberation Daily: During the rectification campaign, the joint state-private Star Household Chemical Factory spent lavishly and did some things that shouldn't have been done, spending money that shouldn't have been spent, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses.

During the factory's rectification, a total of 10,940 yuan was spent. According to a preliminary investigation, among the fifteen expenditure items during the rectification, eight items, totaling more than 7,000 yuan, were either dispensable or completely unnecessary. For example, the cosmetics workshop has a total of twenty-six employees and has never had heating equipment. The workshop's building was originally a warehouse and was temporarily rented; according to the original contract, the lease would expire in 1958, and the right to use the building was not yet determined. During this rectification campaign, some people proposed installing radiators, but some workers said: We've managed for several years without radiators, so it's okay not to install them. However, the leadership did not properly consult with the workers or explain the situation. They unilaterally believed that since they hadn't been installed for several years, they would feel bad if they didn't install them now. Therefore, they spent 5,000 yuan installing radiators. Some people in the workshop requested the installation of a radio, and the leadership did not study it carefully, spending 580 yuan to install one. What was the result? Most of the twenty-six workers in the workshop went home for meals, and only about ten people were listening during broadcasts, and the sound quality was poor, so the workers were still not satisfied. For example, the office staff had always used braziers for heating in the winter, and some people proposed replacing them with stoves, which the leadership agreed to, costing 420 yuan.

Such spending has caused dissatisfaction among many employees, who have made very pertinent criticisms of the leadership's lavish practices. Some said, "During the rectification, the leadership failed to grasp the policy of running the enterprise diligently and economically, only listened to the opinions of a few people, and did not consult with the majority of people before making changes, wasting a lot of the country's money." Some said, "The leadership has not properly educated everyone that welfare issues should be considered from the perspective of a population of 600 million." Ji Chenglong, an old worker in the cosmetics workshop, said, "Think about the farmers who are still working in the fields in such cold weather. We are working in the workshop, and even if it's cold, it's better than the farmers."

### 明星家用化学品厂一边整改一边浪费  职工群众批评领导人员违反勤俭办企业的方针

    明星家用化学品厂一边整改一边浪费
    职工群众批评领导人员违反勤俭办企业的方针
    本报讯　据解放日报报道：公私合营明星家用化学品制造厂整改中大手大脚，办了些不该办的事，花了不少不该花的钱，引起群众的不满。
    该厂整改中共支出一万零九百四十元，经初步检查，在整改中十五个花钱的项目中，有八个项目，共七千多元的支出，是属于可办可不办，或根本不应该办的。如化装品车间总共二十六个职工，一向没有保暖设备，该车间的厂房本来是仓库，是临时租用的，按原合同1958年就到期了，使用权尚未确定。这次整风中有人提出要装水汀，但也有些工人说：没有水汀也过了几年，不装也可以。但是领导上没有很好和工人商量，说明情况，片面认为几年来没有装，再不装就过意不去了，因此，花了五千元装上了水汀。该车间有人要求装广播器，领导上也未很好研究，花了五百八十元装了一个。结果怎样呢？这个车间内二十六个工人大部分是回家吃饭的，广播时只有十来个人在听，加上声音又不好，工人还是不满意。再如科室办公室冬天一向是用火缸取暖，有人提出换火炉，领导上也就同意了，花去四百二十元。
    这样花钱，不少职工表示不满了，他们对领导上这种大手大脚的做法提出了很中肯的批评。有的说：“整改中领导上没有掌握好勤俭办企业的方针，只听少数人的意见，没有和大多数人商量就改，浪费了国家许多钱。”有的说：“领导上没有很好教育大家，对福利问题应该从六亿人口出发。”化装品车间老工人吉成龙说：“想想农民在这样冷的天还在田里干活，我们在车间里工作，再冷也比农民好。”
