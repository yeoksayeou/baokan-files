Leading Cadres Take the Lead in Setting an Example, Cadres Work Actively and Diligently
Ministry of Internal Affairs Vigorously Improves Letters and Visits Work

(Our Newspaper Reporter Mu Yang reports) The Ministry of Internal Affairs, based on the spirit of rectification while correcting, has improved the work of handling letters and visits from the people during the rectification movement. Now, a new atmosphere, unprecedented in the past, has emerged.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs receives a large number of letters and visits from the people. Last year, it received more than 50,000 letters from the people and received more than 20,000 visiting people. In the first quarter of last year alone, the number of people's visits handled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs accounted for one-third of the total number of visits to the 21 central state organs.

In the past, although Minister Xie Juezai always attached importance to this work, due to the lack of understanding of this work by general cadres, there were still many shortcomings in the work. Some people did not consider it from a political perspective, but only from their personal gains and losses, believing that handling letters and visits from the people was a "dead-end" "chore," and a "mere sideline of dealing with the front desk." Many people believed that after "transferring" the letters and "sending the visitors out of the Ministry of Internal Affairs," they had "completed the task." Under the influence of this kind of thinking, the problems reflected in the letters and visits from the people would inevitably not be fully and correctly handled. Taking the Preferential Treatment Bureau, which has the largest workload in this area, as an example, the letters and visits they transferred to local organs and other organs for handling usually accounted for 60% to 70% of the total number of letters and visits. In addition, because there were few leaders who reviewed the handling of letters and visits, and there were too many levels of processing, generally transferred letters had to stay in the ministry for more than a month, resulting in backlogs. In addition, the quality of handling letters and visits was not high, so the proportion of cases with multiple letters and visits was also very large.

During the rectification movement, comrades put forward many well-intentioned criticisms and feasible suggestions regarding the shortcomings in this work. The Party Group and Rectification Leading Group of the Ministry of Internal Affairs also regarded this work as one of the important contents of rectification and improvement, mobilized everyone to repeatedly study and discuss it, and carried out many improvements at any time in the spirit of rectifying while correcting.

Soon after the start of the rectification movement, the Party Group of the Ministry designated Vice Minister Guo Bingkun to specifically manage the work of handling letters and visits. The ministerial meeting held on June 25 last year, based on Minister Xie Juezai's suggestion, formulated a system for leading cadres to handle letters and receive visits. From July last year to the end of the year, all 23 directors and deputy directors of departments and bureaus received a total of 259 visitors, approved 2,163 letters, and personally replied to 253 letters. The leaders of each section and office also jointly formulated a regulation that they should receive visitors at least once a week. Minister Xie Juezai, this old man in his seventies, regularly went to the reception room twice a month. Occasionally, if there was more important work that prevented him from going, he not only asked for leave in advance, but also designated a responsible comrade to go in his place. The visits personally received by Minister Xie and other leading comrades were all personally drafted for transfer and handling, and detailed records were kept for future reference, until the problem was resolved. In their spare time from regularly receiving visitors, the leading comrades of the ministry also often talked with the full-time cadres who were doing the visiting work to understand the situation and help them solve problems in their work.

Because the ideological and policy level of the leading comrades is high and their experience in mass work is rich, the letters and visits they handle are generally of high quality. Some problems that are difficult for some full-time cadres to handle are quickly resolved in their hands. Wang Jinwen, a demobilized soldier from the suburbs of Nanjing, had the technology to make pressed ducks and was determined to leave the agricultural cooperative and go to the city to work as a pressed duck worker. Even after the local government and the full-time cadres of the Preferential Treatment Bureau explained it to him, Wang Jinwen was still not ideologically convinced. Later, Minister Xie met with him. Minister Xie sincerely told him many reasons, and he returned to Nanjing with satisfaction. Before leaving, he said with emotion to others: "Minister Xie is so old, but he personally handles this little thing of mine, what else can I say!"

Leading cadres personally handling a batch of letters and visits not only closely linked the leaders with the masses, but also discovered some important problems and improved their work. Li Fazhuang, Deputy Director of the Preferential Treatment Bureau, discovered during the reception of visitors that some of the visitors intentionally exaggerated some difficulties that could be overcome and complained that the government's care was not enough. In addition to timely educating and criticizing such people, he also made a report to the full-time cadres on "We should criticize right-leaning ideas and statements in the work of handling letters and visits," which drew a clear line for the full-time cadres between solving problems and conducting education. In this way, if they encountered people who made unreasonable demands or individual elements of bad character, these cadres could educate and deal with them according to the specific circumstances.

Leading cadres personally handling letters and visits is the best education for all cadres. Many comrades examined the shortcomings and errors in their work and improved them. With the ideological problem solved, the quality of the work of handling letters and visits also improved. "Be more patient and more meticulous, and solve the problems effectively" has become everyone's common requirement for the work of handling letters and visits. Based on this requirement, they tried their best to explain in detail any problems that could be directly handled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and no longer transferred them down. In this way, the number of visits directly handled by them has now increased to more than 60%. Because the handling is now more meticulous than before, the problem of cases that could not be closed after repeated visits and letters in the past has also been greatly reduced. Not only that, but they also changed the past attitude of "dealing with matters as they are" and "handling official business according to official rules," and adopted an attitude of actively helping visitors and letter writers solve problems, and gave comradely care to some people who were really in difficulty but were not good at or unwilling to express their opinions. Yuan Caiyuan, a demobilized soldier from Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, came to the ministry to ask for an introduction to work. After the comrades who received him repeatedly explained to him the reason why the problem should be solved locally, he could not raise any objections, but revealed some embarrassment. The comrades who received him estimated that he might have other difficulties, so they patiently mobilized him to tell all the words in his heart. It turned out that Yuan Caiyuan did not understand the principle of local resettlement, but because of a love affair, he had a dispute with the village cadres and the woman, and he was embarrassed to go back because of his relationship with the village cadres. The comrades who received him, in response to this situation, once again mobilized him, and after asking the local government to help him resolve the relationship with the village cadres, he happily returned to his hometown. Zhang Lianhe, a demobilized soldier from Qingxian County, Hebei Province, could not enjoy the treatment of a disabled soldier because the record of his injury and illness on his demobilization certificate was not clear, even though he had lost his ability to work. For this reason, he had come to the Ministry of Internal Affairs three times to ask for help. The first two times, the ministry sent letters to the local government, but it was not resolved. The last time, he still agreed to the ministry's sending a letter to contact him, but the comrades in the ministry, considering his actual difficulties and the actual difficulties of the local government, took the initiative to help him check his disability and sent people to the local government to make a detailed explanation and solve his difficulties.

These improvements have greatly strengthened the relationship between the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the broad masses of the people. Now, the number of letters expressing satisfaction with the handling of a certain problem or expressing gratitude to the comrades who received them has increased compared with the past; the number of letters raising criticisms and accusations has decreased relatively. This has further encouraged the comrades of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to be determined to rectify this work. They are continuing to improve the work of handling letters and visits.

    领导带头示范　干部积极努力
    内务部大力改进来信来访工作
    本报讯　记者穆扬报道：内务部根据边整边改精神，在整风运动中改进了人民来信来访工作。现在，已出现了前所未有的新气象。
    内务部的人民来信、来访数量很大。去年全年，共收到人民来信五万多件，接待来访群众两万多人。仅去年第一季度，内务部处理的人民来访，就占中央二十一个国家机关来访总数的三分之一。
    过去，虽然谢觉哉部长一向重视这个工作，但是，由于一般干部对这项工作的认识不足，工作中仍然存在着很多缺点。有些人不从政治上着眼，仅仅从个人的得失出发，认为处理人民来信来访是一项“没有奔头”的“打杂工作”，是“单纯应付门市的副业”。很多人认为把来信“转出去”，把来访的人“送出了内务部的大门”以后，就算“完成了任务”。在这样的思想影响下，人民来信来访中所反映的问题，势必不易全部得到正确的处理。以此项工作量最大的优抚局为例，他们转地方机关和其他机关处理的来信和来访提出的问题，通常都占来信、来访总数的60％到70％。此外，由于审查来信、来访处理情况的领导人很少，处理层次又太多，一般转办的信件都要在部里停留一个多月，发生积压现象。再加上处理来信、来访的质量不高，因此，多次来信、来访的案子占的比例也很大。
    在整风运动中，同志们针对这项工作中的缺点，提出了许多善意的批评和可行的建议。内务部党组和整风领导小组，也把这项工作看作是整改的重要内容之一，发动大家反复研究、讨论，本着边整边改的精神，随时进行了许多改进。
    整风运动开始不久，部党组就指定郭炳坤副部长，专门管理来信、来访工作。去年6月25日召开的部务会议，又根据谢觉哉部长的建议，订出了领导干部处理来信、接待来访的制度。从去年7月开始执行这项制度，到年底，全部二十三位司、局长以上的领导干部，共接待来访二百五十九人，审批来信二千一百六十三件，并且亲自答复了二百五十三件来信。各科、室的领导人，也共同商订了每周至少接待一次来访的规定。谢觉哉部长，这位七十多岁的老人，每月都定期按时到来访室去上两次班。偶尔遇有更重要的工作，不能前往，他不仅事先请假，而且指定一位负责同志代他去接谈。谢部长和其他领导同志自己接谈的来访，都亲自起草转办函件，并留下详细记录，以备查考，直到这个问题得到解决后为止。在定期接待来访的空余时间里，部的领导同志还时常和做来访工作的专职干部进行交谈，了解情况，帮他们解决工作中的问题。
    由于领导同志的思想水平和政策水平高，群众工作经验丰富，他们处理的来信、来访，质量一般都比较高。某些专职干部处理起来有困难的问题，到他们手里就很快地得到了解决。南京市郊区的复员军人王锦文，有作板鸭的技术，一心想脱离农业社，进城去作板鸭工人。虽经当地政府和优抚局的专职干部解释，王锦文仍然思想不通。后来谢部长接见了他。谢部长诚恳地向他讲了许多道理，他满意地回了南京。行前，他感动地对人说：“谢部长这样大年纪，亲自处理我这点事情，我还有什么可说的呢！”
    领导干部亲自处理一批来信、来访，不但密切了领导和群众的关系，还可以从中发现一些重要问题，改进工作。优抚局李法庄副局长，在接待来访中，发现有一部分来访的人，有意地夸大一些可以克服的困难，埋怨政府照顾不够，除了及时对那样的人进行教育批评外，还向专职干部作了“在来信来访工作中应该批判右倾思想言论”的报告，为专职干部划清了解决问题和进行教育的工作界限。这样，如遇到提出不合理要求的人或个别品质恶劣的分子，这些干部就可以分别情况对他们进行教育和处理。
    领导干部亲自处理来信、来访，对全体干部是一种最好的教育。不少同志检查了自己工作中的缺点、错误，加以改进。思想问题解决了，来信、来访工作的质量也随着提高了。“要更耐心、更细致，要切实地解决问题”，已成为大家对来信、来访工作的共同要求。本着这种要求，凡是能够由内务部直接处理的问题，他们都尽量地详作解释，不再下转。这样，由他们直接处理的来访数字，现在已经增加到60％多。由于现在处理得比从前细致，过去多次来访、来信不得结案的问题，也大大地减少了。不仅如此，他们还改变了过去那种“就事论事”“公事公办”的态度，采取了主动帮助来信来访者解决问题的态度，对一些确实有困难而又不善于或者不愿表达自己意见的人，给予了同志式的关怀。山西省长治县复员军人原财元，来部要求介绍工作，接谈的同志向他反复说明应该就地解决问题的道理后，他提不出不同意见，但却流露出一些为难情绪。接谈的同志估计他可能有别的困难，就耐心地动员他把心里的话都讲出来。原来，原财元不是不懂得就地安置的道理，而是因为恋爱问题同村干部和女方发生了纠纷，碍于面子和同村干部的关系，他不愿意再回去。接谈的同志针对这种情况，再次向他作了动员，并且函请当地政府，帮他解决同村干部的关系问题后，他愉快地回了原籍。河北省青县复员军人张连和，由于复员证上对他的伤病情况记录的不清楚，他虽失去了劳动能力，却不能享受残废军人待遇。为此，他曾三次到内务部要求帮助。前两次，部里给当地政府去了信，未得解决；最后一次，他仍同意部里去信连系，但是部里的同志考虑到他和当地政府的实际困难，就主动地帮他检查了残废情况，派人到当地政府去作了详细交代，解决了他的困难。
    这些改进，大大地密切了内务部和广大人民群众的关系。现在，对某一个问题的处理表示满意或者对接谈的同志表示谢意的来信，比从前增多了；提出批评和指责的来信相对地减少了。这也进一步地鼓舞了内务部的同志们对这项工作的整改决心。他们还在继续改进来信来访工作。
