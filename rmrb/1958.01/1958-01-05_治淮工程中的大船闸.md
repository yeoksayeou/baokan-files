    Large Ship Lock in the Huai River Project
    The first large-scale ship lock in the Huai River Project – the Suqian Ship Lock – is under construction on the shores of Luoma Lake in the lower reaches of the Huai River (northern Jiangsu). According to the design, the ship lock is entirely built of reinforced concrete, constructed on China’s longest Grand Canal. The lock chamber is 210 meters long, 15 meters wide, and more than 13 meters high, larger and taller than the Gaoliangjian Ship Lock, Huai'an Ship Lock, Taizhou Ship Lock, and Fukang Ship Lock built in the Huai River Project over the past seven years.

    The Suqian Ship Lock is located in Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, and is a project of the first phase of the Luoma Lake Reservoir major control project in the Huai River basin. The Luoma Lake Reservoir major control first phase project is a comprehensive planning project for flood control, drainage, irrigation, and navigation. It is expected that this lock will be completed in June of this year. After completion, it can develop shipping and promote industrial and agricultural production.

    治淮工程中的大船闸
    治淮工程中第一座规模巨大的船闸——宿迁船闸，正在淮河下游
  （江苏北部）骆马湖滨兴建。按照设计，船闸全用钢筋混凝土建成，建筑在我国最长的大运河上，闸室长两百一十公尺，宽十五公尺，高十三公尺多，比以往七年来治淮工程中兴建的高良涧船闸、淮安船闸、泰州船闸、阜坎船闸还要大、还要高。
    宿迁船闸位于江苏宿迁县境，是淮河流域骆马湖水库大控制第一期工程中的一项工程，骆马湖水库大控制第一期工程是防洪、排涝、灌溉和航运的综合规划工程。预计这座水闸在今年6月建成，建成后可以发展航运，促进工农业生产。
