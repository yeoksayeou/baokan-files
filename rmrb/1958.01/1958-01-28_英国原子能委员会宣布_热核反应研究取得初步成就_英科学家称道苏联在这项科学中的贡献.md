Xinhua News Agency, London — The British Atomic Energy Authority announced on the 24th the experimental results of a group of British scientists at the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Establishment on using thermonuclear reactions to generate electricity. The director of the institute, John Cockcroft, held a press conference on this issue at Harwell on the 23rd.

It was announced that British scientists conducted experiments on a specially made "Zeta" device, passing a current of up to 200,000 amperes through a rarefied plasma area of heavy hydrogen, obtaining a high temperature of 5 million degrees Celsius. At this time, hydrogen atoms undergo fusion, separating thermonuclear neutrons and generating energy equivalent to one trillionth of the input electrical energy. Although no definite evidence has been obtained, British scientists believe that the neutrons produced in this way may be the result of thermonuclear reactions, similar to the reactions that occur on the sun. Therefore, further research is needed to determine the truth.

Cockcroft pointed out that "Zeta" is a ring-shaped aluminum test tube with a strong current of 200,000 amperes passing through the plasma area of heavy hydrogen. He said that to create a thermonuclear reaction, two basic problems must first be solved: first, the wall of the test tube or container in "Zeta" must be insulated from the high-temperature gas inside, otherwise, the wall will melt and thermal energy will be lost. Second, it must have a high enough temperature to produce a thermonuclear reaction.

According to the British Atomic Energy Research Authority, British scientists have partially solved these two problems in the "Zeta" experiment by applying another magnetic field to the high-temperature gas to isolate it from the test tube wall. In addition, the temperature was raised to between 2 million and 5 million degrees Celsius.

Cockcroft emphasized that solving the problem of controlling thermonuclear reactions is still a long way off. To solve this problem, the temperature must first be maintained for a longer period of time (perhaps several seconds) and reach a higher temperature (around 100 million degrees), which requires the manufacture of more powerful equipment. He also said that it would take at least twenty years for the energy of thermonuclear reactions to reach the stage of commercial application.

At the Harwell press conference, Cockcroft and other British scientists pointed out that the work they have done is similar to the research conducted by Soviet scientists mentioned by Academician Kurchatov of the Soviet Union two years ago in a lecture at Harwell.

British scientists pointed out that the "Zeta" equipment uses the method of thermally insulating plasma areas. This method was proposed by Soviet Academicians Tamm and Sakharov in 1950. They also pointed out the great scientific significance of the work done by Soviet physicist Academician Artsimovich in the field of thermonuclear reactions.

### 英国原子能委员会宣布  热核反应研究取得初步成就  英科学家称道苏联在这项科学中的贡献

    英国原子能委员会宣布
    热核反应研究取得初步成就
    英科学家称道苏联在这项科学中的贡献
    据新华社伦敦电　英国原子能委员会24日宣布了哈威尔原子能研究所的一批英国科学家研究利用热核反应来发电的试验结果。这个研究所所长约翰·柯克罗夫特23日在哈威尔就这个问题举行了一个记者招待会。
    据宣布：英国科学家在特制的“泽塔”装置上进行实验，把强度达二十万安培的电流通入重氢的稀薄等离子区，获得了摄氏五百万度的高温。这时，氢原子就发生聚变，分离出热核中子和产生了占输入电能的一万亿分之一的能量。虽然还没有掌握一定的证据，英国科学家们认为，这样产生出来的中子可能是热核反应的结果，和太阳上所发生的反应一样。因此，真相如何，还需要作进一步研究。
    柯克罗夫特指出，“泽塔”是一个环形的铝制试管，里面有二十万安培的强烈电流从重氢的等离子区通过。他说，要制造热核反应，必须先解决两个基本问题：第一、必须使“泽塔”中试管或容器的壁同里面的高热气体隔绝起来，不然的话，壁将会熔化，热能将会失去。第二、必须具有足以产生热核反应的高温。
    据英国原子能研究当局说，英国科学家在“泽塔”实验中部分地解决了这两个问题，办法是把另外一个磁场应用于高热气体，使它与试管壁隔绝。另外，还使温度达到了摄氏二百万度到五百万度。
    柯克罗夫特强调指出，要解决控制热核反应问题，目前还差得很远。为了解决这个问题，首先必须使温度保持更长时间（也许要好几秒钟）和达到更高的温度（一亿度左右），这就需要制造更强大的设备。他还说，要使热核反应的能达到商业运用阶段，至少还需二十年。
    在哈威尔记者招待会上，柯克罗夫特和其他英国科学家指出，他们所做的工作同苏联科学家库尔查托夫院士二年前在哈威尔讲演时谈到的苏联科学家所进行的研究相似。
    英国科学家们指出，“泽塔”设备运用了热绝缘等离子区的方法。这种方法是苏联塔姆和萨哈罗夫院士在1950年提出的。他们还指出了苏联物理学家阿尔齐莫维奇院士在热核反应方面所做的工作的巨大科学意义。
