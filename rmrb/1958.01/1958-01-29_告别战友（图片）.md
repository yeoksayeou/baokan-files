　　Farewell to Comrades-in-Arms
　　The first group of demobilized conscripts have begun to assemble. Zhang Shipei, a major and political commissar of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, exhorted the demobilized comrades: You are meritorious servicemen in the army, technical experts in training. We hope that you will become pioneers in building socialism and production experts in labor in the future.
　　Wei Haisi (Yi ethnicity, first from the right), a private first class of a certain unit, has completed his term of service. Before leaving the team, he unreservedly taught the skills he had learned to new comrades-in-arms.
　　Before leaving the team, Wei Haisi meticulously handed over his beloved weapons, one by one, to his new successor, Wu Yousheng.
　　Though people leave, their hearts remain. Before leaving the team, Wei Haisi (in front) actively eliminated pests and diseases and cleaned up the environment. Photograph by Zhang Zexi, PLA Pictorial Agency

    告别战友
    第一批退伍的义务兵开始集中了。解放军某部少校政委张树培向退伍的同志们嘱咐：你们是部队中的功臣，训练中的技术能手，希望你们今后成为建设社会主义的先锋，劳动中的生产能手。
    某部上等兵韦海思（彝族右一）服役期满，在离队前，把学到的技术毫无保留地教给新战友们。
    韦海思在离队前，把亲爱的武器，一件件细致地交代给新的接班人吴友生。
    人走心未走，韦海思（前者）在离队前，还积极除四害、打扫卫生。解放军画报社稿　张泽西摄
