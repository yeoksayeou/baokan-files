    Notes
    Hit a Wall Again
    The French newspaper "Le Monde" said in an article that French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard's repeated speeches about his "new neutralism" on the eve of the NATO Paris meeting were not really intended to pursue such a policy, but rather a "threat" or "blackmail," the purpose of which was to "make France's 'friendship' with the United States more beneficial to us, and to make the United States pay a greater price."
    In fact, Gaillard's posturing was not about making the United States pay any price to France, but merely asking the United States to be lenient towards France on the Algerian issue. However, the plan fell through. At the Paris meeting, the United States was unwilling to even write a blank check, so Gaillard was still full of complaints when he spoke to a "U.S. News & World Report" reporter not long ago.
    Being a "partner" of the United States inevitably leads to being squeezed by the United States. Gaillard did not learn a lesson from the Tunisian arms supply incident, so it is no wonder that he hit a wall again this time.
    Better to Brag Less
    Dr. Hagen, the head of the U.S. artificial satellite launch program, who had been silent for a long time, appeared before American reporters a few days ago to give a speech. He said that because the previous launch attempt failed, he had "learned some lessons in how to deal with the press," so he would not announce the news of another satellite launch attempt in advance.
    It cannot be said that this is not a beneficial "lesson." Because this at least avoids the public embarrassment of failing again.
    However, Dr. Hagen, who claimed to have "learned some lessons," boasted about the ability of the United States to launch satellites and the "superiority" of American satellites in the same speech.
    Dr. Hagen has obviously forgotten that American satellites are still lying on the ground rather than flying in the sky. So, where is the launching capability of the United States and the "superiority" of its satellites manifested?
    I advise Dr. Hagen to brag less!
    A Leopard Can't Change Its Spots
    Recently, Churchill said in his "New Year's Message" that NATO should "sympathize with and assist any member state that has problems with overseas territories." Obviously, he is advocating that Western colonial countries should unite and intensify the suppression of the struggle of colonial people for independence and freedom.
    Churchill, who has served colonialism all his life, is now in his eighty-third year. When he thinks of the colonial people, he still shows a murderous look on his face. This is truly a case of "mountains and rivers may change, but one's nature remains the same!" However, after all, most of the "mountains and rivers" of the British Empire have been lost, and the days when the colonial system will be completely eliminated are not far away. Churchill's murderous words do not indicate that Western colonial countries have strength, but are merely a lament!

    又碰了钉子
    法国“世界报”在一篇文章里说，法国总理盖伊阿在北大西洋集团巴黎会议开会前夕的几次演说里大谈其“新中立主义”，并不是当真要奉行这样一种政策，而不过是一种“威胁”或者“讹诈”，其目的是想“使法国对美国的‘友谊’给我们的好处更多一些，使美国付出的代价更大一些”。
    其实，盖伊阿这样装腔作势一阵，还不是要美国给法国付出什么代价，而仅仅是要求美国在阿尔及利亚问题上对法国手下留情而已。但是，结果这个打算落空了。在巴黎会议上，美国连一张空头支票都不肯开，以致盖伊阿不久前在向“美国新闻与世界报道”记者谈话时还是牢骚满腹。
    当美国的“伙伴”，就必然要受美国的排挤。盖伊阿在突尼斯军火供应事件中还不接受教训，就无怪乎这次又碰了钉子。
    还是少吹一点吧
    沉默已久的美国发射人造卫星计划的负责人哈根博士，几天前又抛头露面地向美国记者发表谈话了。他表示：由于上次发射尝试失败而在“对待报纸的方法中吸取了一些教训”，所以将来不会事先宣布要作再一次发射卫星的尝试的消息了。
    不能说这不是一个有益的“教训”。因为这样至少在再一次尝试失败时可以避免像上次那样当众丢丑。
    可是，这位自称“吸取了一些教训”的哈根博士，却在同一次谈话里又对美国发射卫星的能力和美国卫星的“优越”大肆吹嘘了一番。
    哈根博士显然忘记了，美国的卫星到现在为止还是躺在地上而不是飞在天上。那么，美国的发射能力和它的卫星的“优越”又表现在哪里呢？
    奉劝哈根博士，还是少吹一点吧！
    秉性难移
    最近，丘吉尔在“新年贺辞”中说，北大西洋集团应该“同情和援助在海外领土方面有问题的任何成员国”。显然，他是在鼓吹西方殖民国家要联合起来加紧镇压殖民地人民争取独立自由的斗争。
    为殖民主义效劳了一生的丘吉尔，如今已是八十三岁的风烛残年了。他一想到殖民地人民，依然现出满脸杀气，这真是“江山易改，秉性难移”！可是，大英帝国的大半壁“江山”毕竟已经失去了，殖民制度彻底消灭的日子也已经不远了。丘吉尔杀气腾腾的话，并不表示西方殖民国家有力量，不过是哀鸣而已！
