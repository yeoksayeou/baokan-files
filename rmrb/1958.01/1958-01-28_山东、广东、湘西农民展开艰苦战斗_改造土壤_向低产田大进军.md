Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 27th: After widespread snowfall, agricultural cooperatives in Shandong Province are persisting in plowing, digging, and transforming the soil. Since last winter, the labor force dedicated to soil improvement in various agricultural cooperatives has accounted for about 30% of the total labor force. By mid-January, the province had transformed more than 4.7 million mu of waterlogged and low-lying land and over 3.2 million mu of saline-alkali and sandy wasteland. Both figures are about double the amount of soil improvement done in 1956, which was the year with the most soil improvement. Agricultural cooperatives across the province have also plowed and dug (to a depth of 1.5 to 5 feet) more than 14 million mu of land, thickening the arable layer. The total amount of land plowed is more than ten times that of the same period last year. After entering the freezing season, agricultural cooperatives in Liaocheng and Huimin Prefectures, where there is more sandy-alkali and waterlogged land, continue to improve the soil with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, exceeding the soil improvement plan for last winter and this spring by mid-January.

Shandong Province is partially coastal and also the area where the Yellow River flows into the sea. In the past, due to the inability to control severe soil erosion and floods caused by the Yellow River breaching its banks, more than 47 million mu of poor soil, such as saline-alkali, sandy wasteland, and waterlogged land, were created. Since 1954, with the development of agricultural cooperation, over 13.58 million mu of poor soil have been transformed, and 10 million mu of land have been plowed and dug, resulting in good harvests. Based on this, Shandong Province has recently formulated a long-term plan for transforming poor soil, requiring that all 47 million mu of poor soil in the province be transformed into fertile land within three to five years, and that all 70 million mu of land that needs deep plowing and digging be deeply plowed once.

This newspaper reports: While vigorously developing water conservancy, the broad masses of peasants in Guangdong Province have formed a labor force of several million people, striving to transform 10 million mu of low-yielding fields this year. For more than ten days, the masses in the Pearl River Delta, the Han River, and along the East River have braved the cold wind and rain, using loads of transported soil to replace old soil, mixing sand with mud, and digging ditches for drainage. According to statistics, more than 2 million mu of low-yielding fields with very poor soil quality throughout the province have been fundamentally changed.

This year, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the task of improving 10 million mu of low-yielding fields, which has been enthusiastically responded to by rural cadres and peasants throughout the province. Many agricultural cooperatives have revised their relatively low targets and expanded their soil improvement plans. The Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Heyuan County originally only planned to improve 800 mu, but now it has increased to 1,479 mu, with 92% of the labor force being put into the struggle to improve the soil every day. The Zhanjiang Special Zone has also used extensive airing of views, debates, and discussions to refute the erroneous arguments of rich peasants and some wealthy middle peasants who claimed that "soil improvement is too troublesome, too labor-intensive, and too difficult." The vast majority of peasants generally agree that improving low-yielding fields is a good trick to promote increased grain production and a leap forward. The peasants said: "There are only lazy people, no lazy fields." As long as we can resolutely work to the end, we can achieve increased production. The Zhanjiang Special Zone is now striving to overfulfill this year's plan to improve 2 million mu of low-yielding fields.

Last year, Guangdong Province improved 5 million mu of low-yielding fields, and most of them achieved significant increases in production. Generally, the yield of rice increased by 50 to 70 jin per mu, with some reaching more than 100 jin. Lianping County, the first in the province to achieve three 90%s (90% of the cooperatives increased production; 90% of the cooperative members increased their income; and 90% of the cooperative members caught up with the level of wealthy middle peasants), increased the average rice yield by 107.5 jin per mu from 1953 to 1956. However, after implementing large-scale soil improvement last year, the unit area yield of early rice alone increased by 61 jin, which is equivalent to about 60% of the total increase in production in the past four years. This proves that improving low-yielding fields is an extremely effective measure to increase production.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, dispatches: More than 200,000 young and middle-aged peasants of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture are braving the severe cold, building water conservancy projects, improving soil, and thoroughly transforming low-yielding fields in the high mountains and dense forests.

This is the third year that the Xiangxi mountainous area has carried out a large-scale movement to transform low-yielding fields. This year, the autonomous prefecture started this work earlier than in previous years, with greater enthusiasm. At present, the prefecture has completed more than half of the total labor days for water conservancy construction and accumulated about 150 million dan of various fertilizers. More than 40,000 mu of low-yielding fields in Guzhang County will be completely eliminated. This item alone will increase the county's grain production by 7.2 million jin this year, which is equivalent to 20% of the county's total grain output last year. On a mountain more than 1,200 meters above sea level in the Yangmeng Miao Agricultural Cooperative in Jishou County, more than 200 people brave the heavy snow every day to dig ditches and accumulate fertilizer. They want to increase the grain yield of 289 mu of low-yielding fields from 48,000 jin last year to 160,000 jin this year.

Xiangxi has more than 2.1 million mu of paddy fields, tens of thousands of which are distributed on very high mountaintops, lacking water, with poor soil quality, and backed by mountains. In the past, cultivation was extensive, yields were very low, and in disaster years, there would be no harvest. In the past two years, agricultural cooperatives have gradually transformed low-yielding fields according to their different types and adopted different methods. At present, nearly 1 million mu of low-yielding fields have been initially transformed, and the unit area yield has increased from the original dozens of jin to more than 100 jin to 200 jin.

### 山东、广东、湘西农民展开艰苦战斗  改造土壤　向低产田大进军

    山东、广东、湘西农民展开艰苦战斗
    改造土壤　向低产田大进军
    新华社济南27日电　山东省各地农业社在普降大雪之后，翻地、刨地和改造土壤的工作仍在坚持进行。从去年冬季以来，各地农业社投入改良土壤的劳力占劳力总数30％左右。到1月中旬止，全省已改造涝洼地四百七十多万亩，改造盐碱地和砂荒地三百二十多万亩，这两项都比改良土壤最多的1956年增加一倍左右。各地农业社还翻地、刨地（深达一尺五寸到五尺）一千四百多万亩，加厚耕作层，翻地总数比去年同期增加了十倍以上。进入封冻以后，砂碱地和涝洼地较多的聊城和惠民专区各农业社，仍以愚公移山的劲头突击改良土壤，到一月中旬超额完成了去冬今春改良土壤的计划。
    山东省半边沿海，又是黄河入海的地区。过去由于无力控制严重的水土流失和黄河决口等水患，造成盐碱、砂荒和涝洼等不良土壤四千七百多万亩。从1954年以来，随着农业合作化的发展已陆续改造不良土壤一千三百五十八万亩，翻地刨地一千万亩，并获得良好的收成。在此基础上，山东省最近又制定出改造不良土壤的长远规划，要求在三年到五年内，将全省四千七百多万亩不良土壤全部改造为良田，并把需要深翻、深刨的七千万亩土地也全部深翻一遍。
    本报讯　广东省广大农民在大兴水利的同时，组成了几百万劳动队伍，争取在今年改造一千万亩低产田。十多天来，珠江三角洲、韩江和东江两岸的群众，冒寒风冷雨千车万载进行用客土换旧土、掺沙拌泥和开沟排水等工作。据统计，目前全省已经有二百多万亩土质很坏的低产田从根本上改变了面貌。
    今年中共广东省委提出要改良低产田一千万亩的任务，得到全省农村干部和农民的热烈响应。许多农业社都纷纷修订了偏低的指标，扩大了改良土壤的计划。河源县金星农业社原来只准备改良八百亩，现在已增加到一千四百七十九亩，每天有92％的劳动力投入到改良土壤的斗争中。湛江专区还通过大鸣、大放、大辩论来驳倒了富农和一些富裕中农所叫喊的“改良土壤太麻烦、太费工、太辛苦”的错误论调，绝大多数农民都公认改良低产田是促进粮食增产跃进的好窍门。农民说：“只有懒人，没有懒田”，只要能够坚决的干到底，就能够获得增产。现在湛江专区正在争取超额完成今年改良低产田二百万亩的计划。
    去年广东全省改良了五百万亩低产田，大多数获得显著增产。一般每亩增产稻谷五十至七十斤，高的达到一百多斤。全省第一个实现三个90％（90％的社增加生产；90％的社员增加收入；90％的社员赶上富裕中农水平）的连平县，从1953年到1956年平均每亩稻田增产一百零七斤半，但去年实行大面积改良土壤后，单是早造的单位面积产量就增加六十一斤，等于四年来增产总和的六成左右，这证明改良低产田是一项极其有效的增产措施。
    据新华社长沙电　湘西土家族苗族自治州二十多万青壮年农民，正冒着严寒，在高山密林里兴修水利，改良土壤，彻底改造低产田。
    这是湘西山区开展大规模改造低产田运动的第三个年头了。今年，自治州进行这项工作比往年早，干劲大。目前全州兴修水利已完成总劳动日的一半以上，积的各种肥料约一亿五千万担。古丈县四万多亩低产田将被彻底消灭，仅这一项，这个县今年就可以增产粮食七百二十万斤，等于去年全县粮食总产量的20％。在拔海一千二百多公尺高的吉首县阳孟苗族农业社的一座大山上，每天都有二百多人冒着大雪开沟、积肥，他们要把二百八十九亩低产田的粮食产量由去年四万八千斤跃进到今年十六万斤。
    湘西共有稻田二百一十多万亩，其中有几十万亩田分布在很高的山顶上，缺水，土质不好，背山，过去耕作粗放，产量很低，碰上灾年就要颗粒无收。两年来，各农业社根据不同类型的低产田，采取不同的办法逐步进行改造。目前已经初步改造低产田近一百万亩，单位面积产量从原来的几十斤提高到一百多斤到二百斤。
