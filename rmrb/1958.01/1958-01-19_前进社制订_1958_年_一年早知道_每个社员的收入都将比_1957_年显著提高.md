The Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Township, Xiangyuan, Shanxi, which pioneered the use of "One-Year Early Knowing" charts to guide production last year, is currently having each household formulate its own "One-Year Early Knowing" for this year.

The cooperative recently passed a distribution resolution, turning the results of the 1957 "One-Year Early Knowing" into charts that were distributed to each member. A summary of the implementation over the year was also made. On this basis, the Party branch organized all members to study the National Agricultural Development Program, greatly encouraging their production enthusiasm. This quickly sparked a wave of enthusiasm for formulating the 1958 "One-Year Early Knowing." After full deliberation and discussion by everyone, the cooperative formulated its 1958 production, financial, and other plans. The planned grain yield for this year is increased from 368 jin per mu in 1956 (last year's yield was 246 jin per mu due to severe disasters) to 600 jin per mu. The total income of the cooperative (including household sideline income) will increase from 87,800 yuan in 1957 to 129,250 yuan. Public accumulation will increase from 4,000 yuan in 1957 to 8,250 yuan. The average income per person in the cooperative will increase from 79 yuan in 1957 to 114 yuan, and the income of each member household will reach the level of a well-off middle peasant before cooperativization.

After the cooperative's overall plan was formulated, the Party branch and the management committee mobilized members to formulate individual plans. The members, focusing on the cooperative's overall plan, held family meetings to formulate specific plans. For example, Jiang Ersheng's family planned to contribute 410 workdays to the cooperative, accumulate 617 dan of manure, raise two pigs, and raise ten chickens in 1958. Their total income will increase from 633 yuan in 1957 to 737 yuan. At the meeting, they also formulated specific personal plans. Of the eight members of the family, excluding an 80-year-old woman and four children under the age of twelve who could not participate in labor, Jiang Ersheng volunteered to contribute 345 workdays to the cooperative throughout the year, taking advantage of early mornings and late nights to collect 35 dan of animal manure. His wife said, "Raising vegetables and pigs is my responsibility, and taking care of the children and household chores is even more my responsibility." His sixteen-year-old daughter planned to "Besides helping my mother cook, taking care of the children, and handling household chores, I will also contribute 65 workdays to the cooperative, raise chickens, and collect 12 dou of sheep manure in winter and spring to deliver to the cooperative as base fertilizer."

Cooperative member Wang Shengrong believed that the agricultural cooperative's 1957 plan was useless. He did not obey labor discipline and idled around throughout the year. At the end of the year, when the distribution was settled, he did not achieve the income plan for the whole family on the "One-Year Early Knowing" chart. He originally planned to contribute 200 workdays, but actually contributed 54 workdays. He originally planned an average income of 227 yuan per person for the whole family, but the actual income was only 97 yuan on average. Through the agricultural cooperative's summary of the benefits and implementation of the 1957 "One-Year Early Knowing," he realized the harm of not following the "One-Year Early Knowing" plan. In addition to making a self-criticism at the family meeting and formulating a plan to guarantee 260 workdays for the cooperative this year, he also made a review at the cooperative members' meeting last year. At that time, he said, "This year, I didn't act according to the 'One-Year Early Knowing,' and I lost both face and money. Next year, I guarantee to complete the 'One-Year Early Knowing' plan, and I will live up to everyone's expectations and not be criticized by my whole family."

Because plans were formulated from top to bottom, from the cooperative to the household, based on common production increase goals, the cooperative's plan and the individual plans of the members were closely integrated. The cooperative originally planned to need 53,723 laborers this year, and the members' self-planned labor contribution was 56,100, exceeding the cooperative's original plan by 4.4%. Members reported raising 670 pigs, which, together with collectively raised pigs, is enough to complete the plan. The amount of fertilizer planned by members accounts for half of the total fertilizer use of the cooperative. The cooperative originally planned a sideline production income of 26,400 yuan, and according to the members' self-planned production, it can be exceeded by 2,400 yuan. According to the cooperative's arrangements and the results of the members' self-planned production, there are eight households with an average income of over 300 yuan per person, twenty-one households with an average income of over 200 yuan, one hundred and twenty-one households with an average income of over 100 yuan, and only forty-seven households with an average income of less than 100 yuan. Among them, excluding three five-guarantee households, the lowest average income per person also reaches 70 yuan. Every household increased income compared to last year.

In order to better implement this year's "One-Year Early Knowing" chart plan, the Party branch and the management committee have supplemented and revised the "One-Year Early Knowing" chart according to the opinions put forward by the members. In the "Collective Income Distribution Plan" column of the chart, items for public accumulation and grain reserves have been added. In the "Labor Input and Advance Planning" column, items such as staple food labor days and labor-based work assignments have been added. In order to give the members a profound impression of the production goals, a "1958 Cooperative's Major Indicators Target" column has been opened on the "One-Year Early Knowing" chart, in which the four major production targets of the cooperative are listed: 600 jin per mu, 1,000 pigs, 750 mu of irrigated land, and 20,000 trees.

After the 1958 "One-Year Early Knowing" chart plan was distributed to the households, it greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the members. Yang Zihai is a feeder who feeds six animals for the cooperative. In order to achieve the cooperative's plan of 600 jin of grain per mu, he planned to accumulate 10 more dan of manure for the cooperative every month in addition to feeding the animals well. In winter production, members used their brains and found clever ways to launch a campaign to realize the 1958 plan. According to statistics, a total of 87 good ideas for increasing production and income have been offered, the most profitable of which is the clever idea proposed by member Hao Yougen (poor peasant) to advance to the North Datan river滩. He said that building three water retaining dams on this river滩 can expand the land area by 200 mu, and all of it can be turned into irrigated land, which can be profitable in the same year. At 300 jin per mu, it can increase grain production by more than 60,000 jin. The members were very happy, and 83 households spontaneously raised 2,500 yuan to build the river坝. Currently, 50% of the cooperative's labor force is advancing to the river滩. Their slogan is: "Members are determined and not afraid of the cold weather; Blocking the Zhanghe River water, building a new Xiahew湾; Realizing early knowing, water conservancy is the most important." According to current statistics, the cooperative has completed 70% of its water conservancy construction tasks, basically completed winter topdressing for wheat, completed 75% of the base fertilizer plan (an average of 150 dan per mu), completed 32% of the annual pig raising plan, and the sideline income of 930 yuan has exceeded the planned completion number of 845 yuan for the tenth lunar month of the "One-Year Early Knowing" chart by 10%. More than 95% of the cooperative's labor force is involved in winter production.

    前进社制订1958年“一年早知道”
    每个社员的收入都将比1957年显著提高
    本报讯　去年首创用“一年早知道”图表来指导生产的山西襄垣城关乡前进农业社，目前家家户户正在分头制订今年的“一年早知道”。
    这个社最近通过分配决算，把1957年“一年早知道”的实现结果制成图表，发给了每个社员，并且对一年来的执行情况作了总结。在这基础上，党支部组织全体社员学习了全国农业发展纲要，社员的生产积极性受到极大鼓舞，很快就掀起了制订1958年“一年早知道”的热潮。经过大家充分酝酿讨论，全社订出了1958年的生产、财务等各项计划。今年粮食产量计划由1956年（去年因受重灾，亩产二百四十六斤）亩产三百六十八斤，提高到六百斤；全社总收入（包括家庭副业收入）要由1957年的八万七千八百元增加到十二万九千二百五十元；公共积累由1957年的四千元，积累到八千二百五十元；全社每人平均收入由1957年七十九元提高为一百一十四元，并且使每个社员户的收入，都要达到合作化前富裕中农的水平。
    在全社计划订出之后，党支部和管理委员会就发动社员订个人计划。社员们都围绕社的总计划，户户召开家庭会，订具体计划。比如社员姜二生全家，全家订出计划1958年向社投工四百一十个，积肥六百一十七担，家庭养猪二只，养鸡十只，总收入由1957年六百三十三元增加到七百三十七元。他们全家在会议上又订出了个人具体计划，全家八口人，除一个八十多岁的老太婆和四个十二岁以下的小孩不能参加劳动外，姜二生自报全年要向社投工三百四十五个，要抽起早搭黑的时间，拾畜肥三十五担。他的妻子说：“打野菜养猪都算我，看小孩和料理家务更是我的责任。”他的一个十六岁闺女订计划说：“我除帮助妈妈做饭、瞧孩办理家务杂事外，也要向社投工六十五个，捎带养鸡，冬春两季还要拾羊粪十二斗交到社里做底肥。
    社员王生荣认为农业社1957年的计划不顶用，一年来不服从劳动纪律，游手好闲，到年终分配决算，没有实现了“一年早知道”图表上全家的收入计划。他原计划投工二百个，实际投工五十四个；原计划全家每人平均收入二百二十七元，实际收入只平均九十七元。通过农业社总结1957年“一年早知道”的好处和执行情况，他才认识了他没有按照“一年早知道”计划办事的害处。他除在家庭会议上作了检讨，订出今年保证向社投工二百六十个的计划外，去年还又在社员大会上作过检查。那时他说：“今年我没有按一年早知道办事，落了个人、钱两丢，下年保证完成‘一年早知道’的计划，总要对得起大家，也不受全家人的批评。”
    由于由上到下，由社到户都根据共同的增产目标制订了计划，社的计划和社员个人的计划就紧密地结合了起来。社里原计划今年需用劳动力五万三千七百二十三个，社员自订计划投工为五万六千一百个，超过了社里原订计划的4.4％；社员自报养猪六百七十只，加上集体养猪数足可完成计划；社员的计划投肥数已占到全社用肥量的一半；社里原订计划社员家庭副业生产收入二万六千四百元，按照社员自订计划可以超额完成二千四百元。根据社里安排和社员自订计划的结果，每人平均收入达三百元以上的有八户，平均收入在二百元以上的有二十一户，平均收入在一百元以上的有一百二十一户，平均收入不达百元者只有四十七户，其中除三户五保户外，最低每人平均收入也达到七十元。户户比去年增收。
    前进社为了把今年“一年早知道”图表计划执行得更好，党支部和管委会根据社员们所提出的意见，把“一年早知道”图表作了补充修改。在图表上把合作社“集体收益分配计划”栏内，增加了公共积累项和粮食储备两项，在“劳力应入工和预支规划”栏内增加了口粮劳动日和以劳力分别定工等项目。他们为使社员对生产奋斗目标有个深刻的影响，特在“一年早知道”图表上开辟了一个“1958年全社几个主要指标奋斗目标栏，将全社的四大生产指标订上去。即：亩产六百斤；养猪一千只；水地七百五十亩；植树二万株。
    1958年“一年早知道”图表计划入户以后，大大鼓舞了社员的生产积极性，杨子孩是个饲养员，给社里喂六头牲口。他为了实现全社亩产六百斤粮食计划，订出计划除喂好牲口外，每月向社多积圈肥十担。在冬季生产中，社员们个个动脑筋、找窍门，展开了一个实现1958年计划的献计运动。目前统计，一共献出八十七条增产增收妙计，其中得利最大的是社员郝有根（贫农）提出向村北大河滩进军的一条妙计。他说，这个河滩打上三道拦水坝，能扩大土地面积二百亩，并且全部能变成水地，当年就可以有收益。每亩产量以三百斤计，共可增产粮食六万多斤。社员们都很高兴，有八十三户社员自动集资二千五百元决心打河坝。现在全社50％劳力正在向河滩进军。他们的行动口号是：“社员决心大，不怕天气寒；拦挡漳河水，新建下河湾；实现早知道，水利最当先。”据目前统计，该社的水利建设任务已完成计划的70％，小麦冬追基本完成，肥料已完成底肥计划（每亩平均一百五十担）的75％，养猪完成全年计划的32％，副业收入九百三十元，已超过“一年早知道”图表农历10月份计划完成数八百四十五元的10％。全社95％以上劳力全部卷入到冬季生产中。
