The Tendency to Emphasize Display and Compete in Extravagance is Undesirable

We are all women workers. Based on what we have learned in our work, the phenomenon of understanding improvement of living standards one-sidedly like Huang Xiuying and spending money casually is quite common. Currently, among the employees and their families in factories, enterprises, and government organizations, many people more or less lack long-term planning and spend as much money as they have. Some even borrow money to raise their living standards. Especially young people, who have not experienced hardship and have no burdens, become particular about ostentation when their income is slightly higher, and they compete with each other in eating, dressing, and showing off their wealth. When someone gets married, they must have a "full set of new things" and the practice of lavishly inviting guests and giving gifts is even more prevalent. Recently, a female worker in a factory got married, and the bride and groom prepared two sets of wooden furniture and bedding. The groom's family prepared a writing desk, a five-drawer cabinet, chairs, a bed, bedding, etc.; the bride's family also prepared a wardrobe, a table, chairs, a bed, bedding, and other complete sets of utensils. Her clothing, including the existing and newly purchased items, included: four sweaters, two pairs of woolen pants, two woolen scarves, two pounds of wool yarn, two pairs of twill pants, three pairs of cloth pants, two woolen coats, one silk-padded jacket, ten silk and cloth quilt covers, three sheets, two blankets, five pairs of pillows, and four pairs of leather shoes; countless other cloth clothes and woolen scarves are not counted.

She herself believes that she can spend the money she earns through labor as she pleases. She also said, "Am I wasting money if I don't eat or spend extravagantly and buy some things? Marriage is a once-in-a-lifetime event. Wouldn't it be too unfair to myself if I didn't make some clothes and add some furniture?" Other employees did not criticize her either. Some people felt that since she was economically well-off, she could do so.

Some people, even if they have some savings, save money to buy the "three major items" (watch, bicycle, radio). They often withdraw the money when the savings are not enough to buy a bicycle, borrow some money to make up the amount, and then go to buy it. As a result, their living standards always exceed their income.

Some people also live without a plan, being rich for three days and poor for half a month. A single cadre in a government organization, with no burdens, earns more than seventy yuan a month but is always short of money. Now that the weather is very cold, he still doesn't have cotton pants to wear.

These people who do not pay attention to arranging their lives and are not thrifty have a common mistaken idea. They believe that "if you get sick, you have free medical care; if you get old, you have a pension; if you have difficulties, you have subsidies. What's the point of saving money if you don't spend it!" They regard those who are frugal as "miserly" and "stingy." They regard extravagance as "generous" and "unrestrained."

Therefore, we fully agree with your newspaper's organization of everyone to discuss the issue of diligence and thrift in managing households, so that everyone can understand the significance of the Party's call for building the country and managing households diligently and thriftily, and understand the benefits of diligence and thrift in managing households for the country and individuals.

    讲排场比阔气的风气要不得
    我们都是妇女工作者。根据我们在工作中所了解到的情况，像黄秀英一样的片面地理解改善生活、随便花钱的现象是相当普遍的。目前在工厂、企业、机关等单位的职工及其家属中，许多人都或多或少地存在着缺乏长远打算，有多少钱花多少钱的情况。有的甚至用借债的办法来提高自己的生活水平。尤其是青年人，没有经过艰难困苦的日子，又没什么负担，收入稍多一些，就讲究起排场来，互相比吃、比穿、比阔气。谁要结婚，一定要搞个“满堂新”，大请其客和馈赠礼物的风气更是盛行；最近某工厂一个女工结婚，男女双方共备办了两套木器和被褥，婆家那边准备了写字台、五屉柜、椅子、床、被、褥等等；娘家这边也准备了衣橱、桌子、椅子、床、被、褥等全套用具。她的衣物，连原有的和新买的就有：毛衣四件，毛裤两条，毛围巾两条，毛线两磅，两条呢裤，三条料子裤，两件呢子外衣，绸子丝棉小袄一件，绸、布被面十床，三条床单，两条毛毯，五对枕头，四双皮鞋；其他布料子衣服、线围巾等等就不计其数。
    对这种铺张浪费的行为，她自己却认为：自己劳动挣来的钱，谁也管不着。又说：没乱吃、乱花，买点东西还算浪费吗？结婚是一辈子大事，不做点衣服、添置点家具不是太亏自己了吗？而别的职工也没有批评她，有的人反而觉得，她既然经济条件宽裕，就可以这样做。
    有些人即使有点储蓄，也是为了攒钱买三大件（手表、自行车、收音机）。往往储蓄的钱还不够买一辆自行车时就把钱取出来，再借点钱凑够了数就去买。结果，生活水平老是超过自己的收入。
    也有的人生活没计划，富三天穷半月。有一个机关干部，单身汉，没有任何负担，每月收入七十多元，总是不够花。现在天气很冷了，他还没有棉裤穿。
    这些不注意安排生活和不节俭的人，有一个共同的错误思想，他们认为“病了有公费医疗，老了有养老金，困难有补助，钱不花留着干什么！”看到别人省吃俭用还认为是“财迷”、“小气”。把铺张浪费看成为“大方”、“不拘小节”。
    因此，我们完全赞成你报组织大家讨论勤俭持家的问题，让大家认识党提出的勤俭建国、勤俭持家的意义，懂得勤俭持家对国家和个人的好处。
