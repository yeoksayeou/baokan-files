International Literary Miscellany

“The Song of Everlasting Regret” Adapted into a New Ballet
Bai Juyi's famous work "The Song of Everlasting Regret" has been adapted into a new ballet by the Marquis de Cuevas Grand Ballet, and was recently performed for the first time at the Edinburgh Arts Festival in the United Kingdom. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang is played by Serge Golovine, and Yang Guifei is played by Nina Vyroubova.

“Mother” Adapted into an Opera
Gorky's famous work "Mother" has been adapted into an opera by Soviet composer Khrennikov, and was recently performed for the first time in Moscow, Leningrad, and Gorky City, winning enthusiastic praise from the Soviet press and audiences.

Remarque's New Work
Erich Maria Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front" has been adapted for the screen, and his new work "A Time to Love and a Time to Die" has recently been made into a film.
This is an anti-war novel based on the Second World War. Remarque himself also plays a leading role in the film, playing a German professor who is ruthlessly killed by the Nazis for helping a Jew.

Moliere's Comedy on the Screen
Moliere's "The Bourgeois Gentleman" will be made into a color stage art film this year. The dialogue and scenes will be exactly as they are on stage, without any changes, so that the audience feels as if they are watching the comedy troupe perform in the theater.

Hemingway's Novels Made into Films
Ernest Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises," "A Farewell to Arms," and "The Old Man and the Sea" have recently been made into films. In the adaptation and production of the first two works, due to the will of Hollywood producers, they were greatly tampered with according to the standard of "whether they can make money," so that the characters in the works were completely changed. It is said that Hemingway participated in the adaptation of the third work, "The Old Man and the Sea," in order to retain his own style.

    雷马克的新作
    德国反法西斯作家雷马克的“西线无战事”曾经搬上银幕，最近他的新作“生死存亡的时代”又摄制成影片。
    这是一本以第二次世界大战为题材的反战小说。雷马克本人还在影片中担任一名主角，他扮演一个德国教授，因为仗义援助一个犹太人而被纳粹无情杀害。
    莫里哀的喜剧上银幕
    法国伟大的喜剧家莫里哀的“醉心贵族的小市民”今年将摄制成彩色舞台艺术影片。对白和场景等完全按照舞台上演出的那样，不加改动，尽量使观众觉得好像在剧院里看喜剧团的演出一样。
    海明威的小说拍成影片
    美国现代著名小说家海明威的“太阳升起”、“告别了武器”和“老人与海”三部作品最近已摄制成电影。前两部作品在改编和摄制中，由于好莱坞制片老板的意志，都被按照“能否赚钱”的标准大加篡改，以致作品中的人物性格面目全非。据说，海明威为保留自己的风格曾参加第三部作品“老人与海”的改编工作。
