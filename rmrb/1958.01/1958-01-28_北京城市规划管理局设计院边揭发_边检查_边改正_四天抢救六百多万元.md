Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Beijing Urban Planning Bureau Design Institute, in the anti-waste movement, used a revolutionary spirit, adopting the method of simultaneously exposing, inspecting, and rectifying. In just four days, they revised over one hundred engineering designs with excessively high standards and blindly pursuing architectural forms, saving the country over 6 million yuan.

　　Big-character posters exposing design waste were first concentrated on the sixty-four construction projects currently underway. The physics building project at Peking University, which had just completed its foundation, was originally designed with elaborate interior and exterior decorations. The height of each floor was up to 4.5 meters, the corridors were equipped with concealed lighting, and the floors were terrazzo. Now, the design team responsible for this project, after collective research, has revised fourteen over-standard decoration projects without affecting quality or use, saving 150,000 yuan. The Labor Protection Exhibition Hall, being built at the Hufang Road intersection, had already entered the decoration stage. The original design included very luxurious interior and exterior decorations. Recently, the 109 large copper chandeliers in the interior were changed to wooden ones, the iron decorative stairs were changed to cement, and the materials used to decorate the exterior walls were also changed. The appearance is just as beautiful, but it saved the country more than 65,000 yuan.

　　For projects that are still in the design stage, the designers started by saving building area, reducing height, and lowering decoration standards to revise preliminary design drawings. The designers responsible for designing the Guangming Daily building, under the influence of the design idea of pursuing grandeur, had designed this project as a very luxurious building. According to the original design, the steps at the entrance of this building, the lobby, and the bottom of the exterior walls were all paved with expensive marble, granite, and artistic terrazzo. The interior doors and windows were all made of hardwood. Recently, the design team responsible for this project revised these unreasonable decoration standards, and preliminary calculations show that it can save 200,000 yuan. An workers' stadium located in the eastern suburbs, according to the original design, would have had to fill the low-lying parts of the terrain to the same height as the road. After the anti-waste movement began, the designers re-measured the site and felt that as long as some underground pipes were laid, rainwater could be drained away, which could reduce the height by one meter compared to the original design, saving more than 3.7 million yuan.

　　While exposing waste, the designers also actively put forward rationalization proposals for modifying designs. The designers of the Second Design Office proposed using asbestos-cement pipes to replace cast iron sewage standpipes. The results of using this rationalization proposal in five projects such as the dormitory of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the dormitory of the People's Hospital showed that not only was the quality very good, but it could also save 69 tons of pig iron, reducing the cost by more than 258,000 yuan.

　　The designers paid attention to ensuring the quality and use of the building for each modification of the engineering design. During the specific modification, it was reviewed collectively by the design team.

    北京城市规划管理局设计院边揭发  边检查  边改正
    四天抢救六百多万元
    新华社26日讯　北京市城市规划管理局设计院在反浪费运动中，用革命的精神，采取边揭发、边检查、边改正三管齐下的办法，在短短四天内，修改了一百多项标准过高、盲目追求建筑形式的工程设计，共为国家节约了六百多万元。
    揭发设计浪费的大字报，首先集中在正在动工兴建的六十四项建筑工程上。刚打完基础的北京大学物理楼工程，原设计室内外的装修都很考究，每层楼房的高度最高的有四公尺五，走廊上装的是暗灯，地面是水磨石。现在，负责这项工程的设计小组，经过集体研究，在毫不影响质量和使用的条件下，修改了十四项标准过高的装修工程，节约人民币十五万元，兴建在虎坊路口的劳动保护展览馆，已经进入装修工程阶段。原设计室内外的一些装修工程非常豪华。最近把室内的一百零九个用铜做的大花灯改为木制的，把铁制的花饰楼梯改为洋灰的，修饰外墙用的材料也改了，外形一样美观，但为国家节省了六万五千多元。
    对于正在设计的工程项目，设计师们也从节约建筑面积、降低高度和装修标准着手，修改初步设计图纸。负责设计光明日报大楼的设计师们，在追求气派的设计思想支配下，曾把这项工程设计成非常豪华的建筑物。按照原设计，这个大楼门口的台阶、门厅和外墙底层，都是用造价很贵的大理石、花岗石、美术水磨石铺成的。室内的门窗都是硬木做的。最近，负责这项工程的设计小组，把这些不合理的装修标准都修改了，初步计算能节约二十万元。座落在东郊的一座工人体育场，按原来的设计要把地势洼的部分填得和马路一样高。反浪费运动开始后，设计师们又重新到现场测定，觉得只要铺设一些地下管，就能把雨水排走，可以比原来的设计高度降低一公尺，节省了三百七十多万元。
    设计师们在揭发浪费的同时，还积极地提出了修改设计的合理化建议。第二设计室的设计师们提出用石棉水泥管来代替铸铁污水立管，这项合理化建议在石景山钢铁厂宿舍、人民医院宿舍等五项工程使用结果，不但质量很好而且能节省六十九吨生铁，使造价降低了二十五万八千多元。
    设计师们对于每一项工程设计的修改，都注意到保证建筑物的质量和使用上的需要。在具体修改的时候，又都经过设计小组的集体研究。
