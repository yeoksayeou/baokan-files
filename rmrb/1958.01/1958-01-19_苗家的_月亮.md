    The Miao People's "Moon"
    He Zhou
    Some Miao and Bouyei ethnic compatriots in Guizhou Province have learned their own ethnic languages. They use the newly created script to record work points, write notes, compose folk songs, and write letters. The newly created script has become a treasure in their daily lives. Their joy and gratitude are overflowing. The Miao compatriots describe the newly created Miao script as "the moon rising over the mountains," which is entirely understandable.
    It is very difficult for ethnic minorities to not have their own written language. Some ethnic minority cooperatives cannot find talents like accountants, so they have to use methods such as knot-tying, wood-carving, and counting beans to assess work and record points. In the past, there was no way to record the history of one's own ethnic group, no way to record one's own words. What a tragedy that was! However, today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, ethnic minorities have their own written languages. What a great joy this is!
    Our country has nearly fifty ethnic groups, many of whom do not yet have their own written languages, and it is urgent that we help them create their own. The draft of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme announced this time is of great benefit to the creation and reform of ethnic minority languages and can serve as a common basis for this work. The scripts of the sixteen ethnic minorities in southwestern China are all created using the Latin alphabet, which is very easy to learn. This is the case with Miao and Bouyei scripts. We believe that the creation and reform of ethnic minority scripts will inevitably be further developed in the future. It can be envisioned that when all ethnic groups in our country combine their own writing systems with the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, then the political, economic, and cultural ties between our various ethnic groups will be further consolidated, and the political, economic, and cultural development of ethnic minorities will also be accelerated.

    苗家的“月亮”
    河洲
    贵州省一些苗族、布依族同胞学会本民族文字了。他们用新创立的文字记工分，开便条，编山歌，写书信。新创立的文字成了他们日常生活中的珍宝。他们的喜悦和感激的心情溢于言表。苗族同胞把新创立的苗文形容成“山头初升的月亮”，这是令人完全可以了解的。
    少数民族同胞没有文字，困难是很多的。有些少数民族的合作社，找不到会计一类的人才，不得不用结绳、刻木、数豆的办法来评工记分。过去没有办法记述自己民族的历史，没有办法记述自己的话，这是多么大的悲剧啊！然而，在今天共产党的领导下，少数民族有了自己的文字了。这又是多么大的喜事呢！
    我国有近五十个民族，其中有许多民族还没有自己的文字，亟待我们去帮助他们创立自己的文字。这次公布的汉语拼音方案草案，对于创立和改革少数民族文字有很大好处，可以作为这个工作的共同基础。现在我国西南十六个少数民族的文字都是采用拉丁字母创立的，学起来很方便。苗文、布依文就是这样的。我们相信，少数民族文字的创立和改革工作，在今后必然会有进一步的开展。可以这样设想，在我国所有民族把自己的文字系统和汉语拼音方案相结合的情况下，那么，我们各族人民之间在政治、经济和文化方面的联系，必将进一步的巩固，而少数民族的政治、经济和文化也将得到更快的发展。
