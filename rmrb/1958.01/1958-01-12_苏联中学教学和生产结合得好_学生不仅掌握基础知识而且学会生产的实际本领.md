Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 11th: To meet the requirements of communist construction, Soviet secondary education is widely implementing the principle of closely combining teaching with productive labor. Particularly since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Soviet educational authorities have adopted a series of measures to strengthen the cultivation of students' communist attitude towards labor and to train their ability to engage in practical labor. According to press reports, these measures aimed at eliminating the phenomenon of disconnecting teaching from life have already had a good effect.

About two-thirds of Soviet secondary school graduates (approximately nearly one million) enter the national economic sectors to engage in physical labor each year. This requires secondary school students to not only master general basic knowledge in school but also to learn practical skills in productive labor. One of the important measures taken by the Soviet Union in this regard is the pilot implementation of a new teaching plan starting from September 1, 1956. The new teaching plan basically does not reduce the teaching of general basic knowledge but greatly increases the number of hours devoted to labor education. Soviet teachers and national education workers believe that this plan can better adapt to the task of solving comprehensive technical education.

According to the new teaching plan, fourth-grade students have two hours of manual labor per week. Rural fifth to seventh-grade students have to work for twelve days each semester, and urban fifth to seventh-grade students have to work for six days each semester. Senior students above the eighth grade have to go to factories, enterprises, collective farms, and machine tractor stations for internships for four hours a week, requiring them to reach the technical level of ordinary workers during the three-year internship.

Currently, most secondary school graduates can meet this requirement. For example, among the fifty-five students who graduated from Ufa No. 15 Middle School last year, forty-nine passed the exam and obtained a worker's grade. Rural secondary school students intern in collective farms and machine tractor stations. For example, the No. 1 Middle School in Stavropol Territory formed a student production team of sixty-five people. The collective farm allocated one hundred and twenty hectares of land and agricultural tools to them. This student production team achieved a bumper harvest just like the collective farm members' production team. Some schools also organize Communist Youth League summer camps to help collective farms with labor for one month.

In order to help students master production technology, many schools have attached internship workshops, handicraft workshops, and school machine tractor stations. There are now more than 10,000 internship workshops in secondary schools in the Russian Federation alone. Students conduct internships in turning, fitting, electrical work, and other labor there. Students in many schools also process parts and other orders for factories and enterprises in the internship workshops.

The amateur youth technical groups established among students have also played a major role in attracting students to participate in production. There are now about 50,000 to 60,000 youth amateur technical groups in the Soviet Union, with more than one million participants. In the groups, students design and manufacture various machine parts and make models of factories and power plants. Rural technical groups engage in activities related to agricultural production. For example, students in Ryazan Oblast organized more than 1,200 technical groups, helping collective farms raise 67,000 head of livestock and 7,500 poultry.

    苏联中学教学和生产结合得好
    学生不仅掌握基础知识而且学会生产的实际本领
    据新华社莫斯科11日电　为了适应共产主义建设的要求，苏联中等教育广泛实行教学同劳动生产密切结合的原则。特别是苏共第二十次代表大会以后，苏联教育机关采取了一系列措施，来加强培养学生的共产主义劳动态度，锻炼他们从事实际劳动的能力。据报刊报道，目前这些旨在消除教学同生活脱节现象的措施已经起了良好的作用。
    苏联每年大约有三分之二的中学毕业生（约近一百万名）要进入国民经济部门参加体力劳动，这就要求中学生在学校中不仅要掌握一般的基础知识，而且还要学会从事生产劳动的实际本领。苏联在这方面采取的重要措施之一，是从1956年9月1日起试行新的教学计划。新的教学计划基本上不减少一般基础知识的讲授，而是大大增加劳动教育的时数。苏联教师和国民教育工作者认为，这个计划可以在更大程度上适应解决综合技术教育的任务。
    根据新教学计划，四年级生每周有两小时的手工劳动。农村的五年到七年级生每学期要劳动十二天，城市的五年到七年级生每学期要劳动六天。八年级以上的高年级生每周要到工厂、企业、农庄、机器拖拉机站去实习四小时，要求他们在三年的实习期间达到普通工人的技术水平。
    目前，大部分中学毕业生都能达到这个要求，例如乌法市第十五中学去年毕业的五十五名学生中，有四十九名通过了考试，得到了工级。农村的中学生则到集体农庄、机器拖拉机站实习，如斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区第一中学组成了有六十五人参加的学生生产队，农庄划给他们一百二十公顷土地，拨给他们农具。这个学生生产队同集体农庄庄员生产队一样获得了丰收。还有的学校组织了共青团夏令营，帮助集体农庄劳动一个月。
    为了帮助学生们掌握生产技术，不少学校附设有实习作坊、手工工场、学校机器拖拉机站。现在仅俄罗斯联邦各中学的实习工场就有一万多个。学生们在那里进行旋工、钳工、电工等项劳动的实习。许多学校的学生还在实习工场里为工厂企业加工，生产零件和其它订货。
    学生中间成立的业余青年技术小组对吸引学生参加生产也起了很大作用。全苏联现在约有五、六万个青年业余技术小组，参加活动的有一百多万人。学生们在小组里自己设计、制造各种机器零件，制作工厂、发电厂模型。农村技术小组则从事有关农业生产的活动，例如，梁赞州的学生们组织了一千二百多个技术小组，帮助集体农庄养大了六万七千头牲口、七千五百只家禽。
