Several Major New Types of Farm Implements

Since 1950, China has begun to experiment with, demonstrate, and promote new types of farm implements. By 1957, a total of fifteen types of major new farm implements, numbering more than 4.68 million units, had been promoted nationwide. These new farm implements have played a significant role in increasing production, improving work efficiency, reducing labor intensity, and consolidating agricultural cooperatives.

Double-Wheel Double-Share Plow: Divided into heavy, medium, and light types according to weight, suitable for dry land farming areas in plains. The heavy type is suitable for clay soil areas, with wider promotion in Heilongjiang Province. The light type is suitable for sandy soil areas, with wider promotion in Shandong Province. The medium type has a wide range of adaptability and a larger promotion area. After modification, medium and light double-share plows can also be used in shallow "muddy foot" paddy fields.

Double-Wheel Single-Share Plow: Divided into large and medium types, mainly promoted in Heilongjiang Province. The medium-sized single-share plow has also been promoted in Xinjiang, Jilin, Shandong, and other provinces. These two types of plows can plow to a depth of over 18 centimeters and require stronger animal power.

New-Style Walking Plow: Divided into No. 18, No. 20, and No. 25 types, with No. 18 and No. 20 being more widely promoted. The walking plow has a simple structure, low price (about 20 yuan per unit), and does not require high technical skills. It plows deeper and turns the soil better than old plows.

No. 16 Mountain Plow: The plowshare can be reversed left and right, suitable for small plots of land in mountainous areas, and can maintain soil and water. It is more widely promoted in the northwestern mountainous areas, and other mountainous areas are being tested.

Wheel-less Single-Share Plow: Light in weight, it can plow to the edges and corners of the field, and can also plow paddy fields. It is more widely promoted in Jilin, Liaoning, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces.

Paddy Field Plow: Includes Jiangxi Paddy Field Plow, East China Paddy Field Plow, Guangdong "51" Plow, Guangxi "53" Plow, Hunan Xiangtan Paddy Field Plow, Yanbian Paddy Field Plow, Guizhou Type 56 Dry and Paddy Field Plow, Hubei Type 56 Single-Share Paddy Field Plow, etc. There are many models, all of which are improved on the basis of old-style plows by various provinces. They plow deeper and require less pulling force than old-style plows, and are promoted in large quantities in the southern provinces.

Spike-Tooth Harrow: Suitable for sandy loam soil, with strong soil crushing and leveling capabilities. It is more widely promoted in Liaoning, Jilin, Xinjiang, and other provinces, and is also promoted in small quantities in sandy loam soil areas within the customs.

Three-Tooth Weeder: More widely promoted in the cotton-growing areas of the North China Plain. Generally, it is reported that it requires less pulling force and has high efficiency. One animal can weed 16-25 mu per day. (Image)

Comprehensive No. Shovel Cultivator: Divided into large, medium, and small models, it is a farm implement for cultivating, weeding, and earthing-up in ridge planting. It requires less pulling force, can perform timely cultivating, and can replace old-style plows for plowing. Because it was created by absorbing the advantages of several kinds of cultivating, weeding, and earthing-up farm implements in Northeast China, it is called a comprehensive shovel cultivator.

Swing-Arm Reaper: Very efficient for harvesting wheat, it can harvest 60 mu per day. It harvests in a timely manner, reduces losses, and is more widely promoted in wheat-producing areas of Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Henan, Shaanxi, and other provinces.

Rice Thresher: When in use, one or two people step on it, and it can thresh 2,000 to 4,000 jin of grain per day.

Disc Harrow: Has strong soil crushing power and can eliminate stubble, suitable for clay soil areas and wasteland harrowing.

Seeder: The currently promoted ones are the ten-row disc seeder and the twelve-row hoe seeder. Both can densely plant wheat, with uniform seeding, consistent depth, neat emergence, and high efficiency. After modification, they can also sow soybeans, sorghum, millet, corn, cotton, etc.

In addition, various localities have also promoted double-row cotton seeders, Soviet-style cultivating and weeding machines, paddy field cultivators, threshers, corn shellers, sweet potato slicing machines, sweet potato shredders, vine cutting machines, chaff cutters, mowers, hay rakes, and many other types of farm implements, all of which are welcomed by farmers for saving labor and producing good results.

    几种主要的新式农具
    我国从1950年起，即开始试验示范和推广新式农具，到1957年全国推广的主要新式农具共有十五种四百六十八万多部。这些新式农具对增加产量，提高工作效率，减轻劳动强度，巩固农业社，起了很大的作用。
    双轮双铧犁　按体重分重型、中型和轻型三种，适用于平原旱作地区。其中重型适用于粘土地区，以黑龙江省推广较多；轻型适用于砂土地区，以山东省推广较多。中型适应性广，推广面积较大。中型和轻型双铧犁，经改装后，在“泥脚”浅的水田里也可以使用。

    双轮单铧犁　分大型和中型两种，主要推广在黑龙江省。中型单铧犁还推广在新疆、吉林及山东等省。这两种犁能深耕到十八公分以上，需要较强的畜力。
    新式步犁　分十八号，二十号和二十五号三种，其中以十八号和二十号推广较多。步犁构造简单，价格低廉（每部二十元左右）使用技术要求不高，较旧犁耕得深，翻土好。
    16号山地犁　犁头能左右反转，适合山区小块地使用，而且能够保持水土。西北山区推广较多，其他山区正在试用。
    无轮一铧犁　体轻、地边地角都能耕到，又可以耕水田。吉林、辽宁、云南、贵州等省推广较多。
    水田犁　包括江西水田犁，华东水田犁，广东“51”犁，广西“53”犁，湖南湘潭水田犁，延边水田犁、贵州56型水旱犁，湖北56型单铧水田犁等，型号很多，都是各省在旧式犁的基础上改良的。较旧式犁耕得深，拉力轻，在南方各省推广数量很大。
    钉齿耙　适合砂壤土，碎土平土能力强。在辽宁、吉林、新疆等省推广较多，关内各省砂壤土地区也有少量推广。
    三齿耘锄　在华北平原棉区推广较多，一般反映，拉力轻，效率高，一头牲口拉，每天能锄地十六——二十五亩。（上图）
    综合号铲趟机　分大、中、小三种型号，是一种垅作中耕除草培土的农具。拉力轻，能及时进行铲趟，并能代替旧式犁耕地。由于它是吸收了东北地区好几种中耕、锄草、培土的农具的优点创造出来的，所以叫综合号铲趟机。
    摇臂收割机　收割小麦效率很高，每天能割六十亩，收割及时，减少损失，在黑龙江、新疆、内蒙古、河南、陕西等省的产麦区推广较多。
    打稻机　使用时一到二人脚踏，每天可脱谷二千到四千斤。
    圆盘耙　碎土力强，并有灭槎作用，适合粘土地区和开荒耙地使用。
    播种机　现在推广的有十行圆盘式播种机和十二行锄式播种机两种，都能密植小麦，播种均匀，深度一致，出苗整齐，效率高。经改装后还可以播种大豆、高粱、谷子、玉米、棉花等。
    此外，各地还推广了双行棉花播种机、苏式中耕除草机、水田中耕器、脱谷机、玉米脱粒机、红薯切片机、刨丝机、切蔓机、铡草机、割草机、搂草机等许多种农具，也都因省工出活，受到农民的欢迎。
