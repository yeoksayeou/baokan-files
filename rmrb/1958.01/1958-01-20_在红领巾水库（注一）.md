At the Red Scarf Reservoir (Note 1)
Wei Ye
Ten years out of nine, it doesn't rain, digging wells takes great pains,
Watering the fields is never enough, drinking water, we must use sparingly,
When will we build a reservoir? We're just waiting for Chairman Mao to decree.
—West Chengzhen Folk Song, Xingtang County, Hebei

    The Cannon's Roar
The dynamite for the groundbreaking was buried at the foot of Sun Slope, like fireworks loaded on the crossroads on New Year's Eve. Thousands of eyes, like those watching blossoming flowers, thousands of faces, revealed excitement mixed with boundless joy.

The red scarves formed a long rainbow, golden brass instruments sparkling in their arms, as if the stars themselves had come to congratulate the reservoir's commencement. The beautiful sight lured the pig-herding children from the river valley, hands cupped to their ears, smiling as if the firecracker fuse was already burning in front of them.

Girls in festive attire flashed past the rainbow-like ranks, like a group of colorful butterflies crossing a brilliant field. Grandpa, over sixty, also came to watch, each step accompanied by laughter. He said he had never seen their hillside so vibrant in his sixty years!

The cannon roared, and the rocks of eternity turned into powder in the blue sky! Drums and gongs played together, music echoed, and the Red Scarf Reservoir became an ocean of laughter, as if in that instant, the most beautiful sounds, the purest emotions, and the noblest intentions in the world, like surging rivers, all converged here.

      Climbing Diaoyutai (Note 2)
A group of new-style farmers climbed Diaoyutai.
They didn't come to fish, but specifically to admire this magnificent project.
Diaoyutai, ah, today Jiang Taigong is no longer your master, because he only knew how to fish here and never made the rocky mountain blossom with peach and plum blossoms, never turned the sandy beach into a green sea. Your grand master's chair is now occupied by new-style farmers, they will forever be your masters, because rocks in their hands will bring abundant harvests. We no longer pray to the Thunder God in the sky when it rains, every piece of land will be draped in green gauze every year, and every village will be lush and verdant every year.
Taigong, fishing will no longer need your golden or jade hook, the fish will automatically fall into their hands.

            Delivering Letters
Letters, like festive fireworks, descended here from all directions.
"Read them word by word, children!" The brigade leader handed a bunch of red, green, yellow, white—five hundred letters of all colors—to the resting workers.

Unfolding the letters, the courtyard looked like it was floating on a colorful cloud.
Reading the letters, the entire courtyard echoed with "Dear Uncle, Grandpa."
It wasn't that the workers didn't have nephews, or hadn't heard anyone call them that before; but reading the letters, it felt like the first time hearing such words, their faces were all smiling, their hearts were drawn by the children to the ends of the earth.

This is a letter from Xiashanzhen Elementary School in Chengde County.
This is a letter from Yuegezhuang Elementary School in Tangshan City.
This is a letter from No. 2 Middle School in Cang County.
This is a letter from Haiyang Road Elementary School in Qinhuangdao.
Each letter sparkled with a crystal-clear heart:
Support our uncles in building the reservoir project,
We will guarantee the completion of the Little Five-Year Plan!

          Oil Pipe
Late at night, a young man ran from the construction site, panting and looking panicked.
"It's broken, the pump's oil pipe is broken!" The words rolled heavily from his trembling lips. Annoyance and anxiety, like two roosters, were fighting in his tender heart. He couldn't stand still, he couldn't sit still. "Director, is there anyone who can fix it? Otherwise, tonight's water will ruin the earthen dam!"

This is the heart of the project, relied upon by thousands of workers.
This is the Great Wall to stop floods, the iron and copper wall to protect the harvest.
At this critical moment, the director's voice was like a battle horn: "Immediately go to the city to invite a welder, even if the wind blows and the rain pours!" Having said that, he immediately handed him a flashlight.

In an instant, he was like a warhorse charging into battle, courageously fighting the storm in the night sky!

          Team Flag
A team flag, a red team flag, fluttering in the cool autumn wind above the right cliff of Diaoyutai.

When the morning sun shines through the morning mist, it is like a magnificent sunflower, welcoming the warmth and joy brought to the construction site by the morning sun with a face full of red light.

When the setting sun is about to set in the west, it is like a clever child, smiling and waving goodbye to Uncle Sun, wishing Uncle a peaceful sleep.

How lovely the team flag is! It was sent by the Hebei Provincial Young Pioneers, it is woven with the Little Five-Year Plan of all the Young Pioneers in the province, it flutters with the children's wisdom in building socialism! It radiates the light of every child's heart, it connects the hearts of the children of the Mao Zedong era. This heart is strong, surpassing boiling steel, they will extinguish all the suffering in the world!

"Protect the team flag, and report the good news to the children with construction achievements!" The voice of thousands of workers, this voice is like a spring thunder.

[Note 1] The Red Scarf Reservoir is a reservoir built with funds donated by the Young Pioneers of Hebei Province to carry out the Little Five-Year Plan activities. Construction began last November and is located in Xichengzhen Village, Xingtang County, Hebei Province.
[Note 2] Diaoyutai is a cliff on the reservoir, according to legend, Jiang Ziya of the Zhou Dynasty once fished under Diaoyutai. At the top of Diaoyutai is a naturally shaped stone chair, according to legend Jiang Ziya sat on this chair to fish.

    在红领巾水库（注一）
    韦野十年九不雨，打井费力气，浇地不够用，喝水得省细，何时修水库，只等毛主席。——河北行唐县西城子民谣
        炮声
    开工的炮药埋在日头坡的脚下，像除夕晚上在十字街装上待放的焰火，千百双眼睛，像注视盛开的花朵，千百张面孔，浮现着怦动而又含着无限的怡悦。
    红领巾结成了一条长虹，金色的管乐在他们怀里闪烁，好像群星也来祝贺水库动工。好景致把放猪的孩子从川里引来，手掩着耳朵，含着笑，仿佛爆竹的导火线已在他面前燃着。
    穿着盛装的姑娘从那长虹般的队前闪过，像一群彩蝶越过灿烂的田野。年过花甲的爷爷也来观景，一步一个笑声，他说六十年来还没有见过他们的山坡是这样的红火！
    炮声轰响了，万代的岩石在蓝空变成了粉末！锣鼓齐奏，乐曲交响，红领巾水库变成了欢笑的海洋，仿佛这一瞬间，人间最美的声音、最淳朴的情感、最高尚的意愿，像澎湃的江河，全汇流在这里了。
      登钓鱼台（注二）
    一群新式的农民登上了钓鱼台。
    他们不为钓鱼，特地观赏这壮丽的工程。
    钓鱼台啊，今天姜太公不再是你的主人，因为他光知在此钓鱼，不曾使石头山桃李花开，不曾使沙滩变成绿海。你的太师椅上，坐的是新式的农民，他们要永远成为你的主人，因为岩石在他们手下要带来丰硕的收成。下雨不再去祈求天上的雷公，每一块土地将年年披上绿纱，每一个村庄将年年景色葱茏。
    太公啊，钓鱼将不再用你那金钩玉钩，鱼儿会自动的落进他们的手。
            递信
    信札像节日的礼花，从四面八方降落到这里。
    “一字一句的看看吧，孩子们的！”大队长把一束束红色的、绿色的、黄色的、白色的，五百封所有颜色的信札，递给了正在休息的民工。
    摊开信札，院子里像浮着一朵朵彩霞。
    读起信札，满院里交响着“亲爱的叔叔、伯伯”的话。
    不是民工们没有侄子，不曾听人这样叫过他；但读起来信呀，仿佛是第一次听到这样的话，他们的脸全在笑，他们的心被孩子们引往了天涯海角。
    这是承德县下栅子完小的信。
    这是唐山市岳各庄小学的信。
    这是沧县二中的信。
    这是秦皇岛海洋路小学的信。
    封封信里全闪烁着一颗晶莹的心：
    支援叔叔们给俺兴建水库工程，
    我们要保证把小五年计划完成！
          油管
    深夜，从工地跑来一青年，他气喘吁吁，面色惊慌。
    “坏了，抽水机油管坏了！”字音从颤抖的口唇上沉重地滚下。懊恼、焦急，仿佛是两只雄鸡，在他那嫩幼的心上斗架，他站也站不住，坐也坐不下。“主任，有没有会修的呢？要不，今夜的水就会泡坏土坝！”
    这是工程的心脏，千百名民工靠着它。
    这是阻拦洪水的长城，保卫丰收的铁壁铜墙。
    在这千钧一发，主任的声音像战斗的号角：“火速进城请焊工，那怕风再吹、雨再大！”说罢，将手电立刻递给他。
    转瞬间他又像一匹冲锋陷阵的战马，在夜空勇猛地与暴雨厮杀！
          队旗
    一面队旗，红色的队旗，在钓鱼台的右壁上空，漫卷着清凉的秋风。
    当朝阳透过晨雾，它像一棵绚丽的向日葵，满面红光地迎接朝阳给工地带来的温暖和快乐。
    当夕阳欲落西山，它像一个伶俐的孩子，向太阳伯伯含笑地招手告别，祝伯伯睡得安乐。
    多么可爱的队旗啊，这是河北省少先队送来的，它织着全省少先队员的小五年计划，它飘扬着孩子们建设社会主义的智慧！它放射着每一个孩子的心灵的光，它牵连着毛泽东时代的儿童们的心。这心是坚强的，赛过了沸腾的钢水，他们要把世上的苦难灭尽！
    “保卫队旗，以建设成绩向孩子们报喜！”上千名民工的一个声音，这声音像一阵春雷。
    〔注一〕红领巾水库是河北省少先队员开展小五年计划活动捐资修建的水库，去年11月开工，位于河北省行唐县西城子村。
    〔注二〕钓鱼台是水库中一个悬崖峭壁的山岗，传说周朝时姜子牙曾在钓鱼台下钓过鱼。钓鱼台顶巅有一自然形状的石椅，传说姜子牙坐在此椅上钓鱼。
