    The Winter Night Sky
    Bian Depei
    "Life is such that we do not meet, moving like Can and Shang." (Du Fu) That Can and Shang are both constellations in the sky. In winter, the Can star twinkles with light, but the Shang star remains hidden. In summer, the Shang star appears, and the Can star hides away. They rise and fall, never meeting. The Zuo Zhuan also contains a story: Emperor Ku had two sons, the elder named Ebo, and the younger named Shi Shen. The brothers were not harmonious, constantly fighting each other, causing the people to be unable to live in peace. Therefore, Yao separated them, placing one in Shangqiu and the other in Daxia, so that they could never meet. These elder and younger brothers are the Shang and Can stars.
    Legends are, after all, legends, but the fact that Can and Shang do not meet is true. If you fear the cold of the winter night and dare not look up at the stars, you will miss the opportunity to meet the Can star.
    Now, every night around eight or nine o'clock, in the due south of the sky, seven bright Can stars form the famous Orion constellation (Can Su). Among them, Can Su Qi is the brightest, Can Su Si and Wu are the hunter's shoulders, Liu and Qi are the two feet, and Yi, Er, and San are the hunter's belt. The three stars on the belt are also called "Three Stars," and now is the time when the Three Stars are shining brightly, while the hunter is holding a knife, facing the oncoming "Taurus."
    Extending upwards from the "Three Stars," in the upper right of Can Su, you can see a bright star and a cluster of small stars, which is the Taurus constellation (Bi Su). The cluster of small stars in Taurus, arranged like a fish spear, may not look bright, but you can still find about a dozen of them. If you use a telescope, you can see as many as dozens. The Book of Songs says: "When the moon leaves Bi, it rains torrentially." This is not scientifically based; rather, those small stars twinkle like a drizzle!
    In the upper right of Taurus is a cluster of tightly arranged small stars, which is the Pleiades. People with good eyesight can see seven stars in the Pleiades, so the Pleiades are also called the Seven Sisters Star Cluster. In ancient times, people used the Pleiades to determine the seasons, so although the Pleiades are not very bright, they are also very famous. The "Hui Bi Xiao Xing" in the Book of Songs' Xiaoxing chapter, "...Hui Bi Xiao Xing, San Wu Zai Dong....Hui Bi Xiao Xing, Wei Can Yu Mao," refers to Can Su and Mao Su (Pleiades).
    In the upper left of Taurus, there is also an almost perfect pentagonal constellation - Auriga. Capella is the brightest star in it. Although Zhu Liu and Zhu Qi stars on the side of Capella are just barely visible, their diameters are hundreds or even thousands of times larger than the sun.
    In the lower left of the "Three Stars," there is a brightest star, which is Sirius. Sirius is a star in the Canis Major constellation, it is twenty-seven times brighter than the sun, only because it is more than 500,000 times farther away from us than the sun, it looks like a small spot of light. If someone on a planet near Sirius looks at the sun, the sun would appear dull.
    Procyon is the brightest star in the Canis Minor constellation, and it forms a large equilateral triangle with Can Su Si and Sirius. Further upwards, Can Su Si, Procyon, and Pollux form a huge isosceles triangle. Pollux belongs to the Gemini constellation.
    These are the most important constellations in the winter night sky. As the seasons change, some stars in the western sky will gradually disappear, and new constellations will rise in the east. If you want to know the traces of the stars' comings and goings throughout the year, it is best to come outdoors to see them. Besides, the winter night sky has the most bright stars and is more beautiful than spring, summer, and autumn!

    冬夜的星空
    卞德培
    “人生不相见，动如参与商。”（杜甫）那参与商，都是空中的星座。冬天，参星闪烁有光，商星却隐而不见。到了夏季，商星露面了，参星又躲藏起来。它们此起彼落，永不相见。左传一书中，还有这样一个故事：高辛氏有两个儿子，大的叫阏伯，老二叫实沈。兄弟二人不睦，不停地相互征讨，弄得人民不能安居，于是尧便把他们分开，一个安置在商丘，一个安置在大夏，使他们永远不能见面。这老大和老二，就是商星与参星。
    传说毕竟是传说，参商之不见确是事实。如果你畏惧冬夜的寒冷，而不敢仰望星空的话，那将要错过同参星见面的机会了。
    现在，每天晚上八九点钟的时候，在天空的正南方，有七颗明亮的参星组成了闻名的猎户星座（参宿）。其中以参宿七最亮，参宿四、五是猎人的肩，六、七是两脚，一、二、三是猎人身上的腰带。腰带上的三颗星，又叫作“三星”，现在正是三星高照的时候，而猎人正手持着刀，面对着撞来的“金牛”。
    从“三星”向上延伸出去，在参宿的右上方，可见到一颗亮星和一簇小星，这就是金牛星座（毕宿）。金牛中的一簇小星，排成鱼叉的样子，看起来虽不算明亮，还可找到十来颗。如果用望远镜，能够看到多至数十颗。诗经上说：“月离于毕，俾滂沱矣。”意思是说，月亮走远了，毕宿就要下雨。其实这是没有科学根据的，倒是那些小星星闪闪烁烁地好像蒙蒙的小雨花呢！
    金牛的右上方，有一簇排列紧密的小星，这就是昴宿。眼力好的人在昴宿里可以看到七颗星，所以昴宿又叫作七姊妹星团。在古代，人们都用昴宿来定季节，因而昴宿星虽不大明亮，却也鼎鼎有名。诗经小星篇中所咏：“嘒彼小星，三五在东。……嘒彼小星，维参与昴”，就是指的参宿和昴宿。
    金牛的左上方，还有一个几乎是正五边形的星座——御夫座。五车二是其中最明亮的一颗。五车二边上的柱六和柱七星，虽只是刚好能看清楚，但它们的直径却比太阳大数百倍乃至数千倍。
    “三星”的左下方，有一颗最亮的明星，那就是天狼星，天狼是大犬星座的一颗，它比太阳要亮二十七倍，只因为它离我们比太阳远了五十多万倍，看起来才成为一个小光点。假若有人在天狼星附近的行星上看太阳，太阳就会显得黯然无色。
    南河三是小犬星座中最亮的一颗星，它同参宿四、天狼星组成一个大的等边三角形。再向上，参宿四、南河三和北河三又组成一个巨大的等腰三角形。北河三是属于双子星座的。
    这些都是冬夜天空中最主要的星宿。随着季节的变化，西面天空中的一些星星将逐渐隐没，而东边又将升起新的星座。如果想知道星星在一年四季中的来去踪迹，最好请你到室外来看看他们。何况冬夜星空的明星最多、比春夏秋各季都更美丽呢！
