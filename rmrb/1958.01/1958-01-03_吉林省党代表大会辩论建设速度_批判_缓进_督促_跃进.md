Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, December 31st: The Second Session of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China Jilin Province was held in Changchun from December 20th to 28th, 1957. The meeting decided: to strive for a complete victory in the rectification movement, thoroughly rectify work styles, improve work, strengthen the Party's leadership over socialist undertakings, push forward the emerging production upsurge, organize a great leap forward in production and construction, and actively strive to achieve the great goals of the socialist cause.

This representative conference was convened in a situation where the struggle against the rightists on all fronts has achieved a decisive victory, a rectification upsurge is forming in various organs, and a production upsurge is rising in industrial and agricultural production. Five hundred and eighty-seven representatives attended the conference, and four hundred and twenty people attended as observers.

The meeting fully reflected the soaring socialist revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of the province. The conference demonstrated a high degree of principled spirit in the criticism and struggle against the right-leaning thoughts in the political and legal departments and against Bao Tinggan, the president of the Provincial Higher People's Court and a rightist. Bao Tinggan negated China's proletarian dictatorship, promoted the political and legal systems of the bourgeoisie, attempted to abolish the Party's leadership over judicial work, and attacked the judicial reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement led by the Party. Under his influence, many counter-revolutionaries and other criminal offenders were wrongly released. The meeting unanimously decided to revoke Bao Tinggan's qualifications as a delegate to the Provincial Party Congress and agreed with the Provincial Party Committee's suggestion that his Party organization should deal with him seriously. The meeting also launched a powerful criticism of the right-leaning conservative thinking that manifested in some Party members and cadres after the realization of the three major socialist transformations. The conference consistently implemented the spirit of rectification, demonstrated full political enthusiasm, and the Party's democratic life was particularly active. A new revolutionary spirit emerged at the meeting.

The meeting focused on discussing and revising the Jilin Province Agricultural Development Plan (Revised Draft) from 1956 to 1967 and the 1958 agricultural production tasks.

The meeting affirmed that Jilin Province's agricultural production had progressed during the first five-year plan, while pointing out that continuous disasters and shortcomings in work had affected the speed of grain production increase. The meeting held that the realization of agricultural cooperation throughout the province had opened up the broadest road for the great development of agricultural productivity, making it possible for agricultural production to achieve a great leap forward. The meeting demanded that the yield per unit area of grain (including soybeans) be doubled within the next ten years, and strive to achieve the goal of reaching 10 million tons of total grain and soybean production. That is, starting from 1958, the total grain production should reach 10 million tons by 1967, from the average total production of 5.38 million tons per year during the first five-year plan. The yield per mu of land should reach 400 jin, 450 jin, 330 jin, and 250 jin respectively, according to the different conditions of the plains, semi-mountainous areas, mountainous areas, and sandy wasteland areas. The meeting pointed out that this goal is active, reliable, and achievable. The conference demanded that efforts be made to complete the task of producing 6 million tons of grain in 1958, in order to lay a good foundation for ensuring the realization of the long-term plan.

The meeting, in the spirit of rectification and criticism and self-criticism, launched a heated discussion on issues such as whether agricultural production could achieve a leap forward. The representatives believed that the agricultural cooperatives throughout the province had demonstrated great superiority in developing production and overcoming natural disasters over the past two years. Some cadres within the Party have exaggerated the impact of natural disasters on the completion of agricultural production plans in the past few years, often underestimated the potential for increased agricultural production, and in the face of the new upsurge of mass agricultural production, have become the main ideological obstacle to realizing a great leap forward in agricultural production. This right-leaning conservative thinking, in the process of implementing the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, is prominently manifested in the contradiction between two kinds of thinking and two kinds of working methods: "leap forward" and "slow progress." Representatives from grassroots production units cited many vivid examples, powerfully criticizing the "small-footed woman's" thinking of slow progress. At present, more than one-third of the agricultural cooperatives in Jilin Province have caught up with and surpassed the production level of well-to-do middle peasants in production. Ninety-three cooperatives in thirteen counties including Yongji have reached and exceeded the target of 400 jin of grain per mu as stipulated in the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. In the past two years, a large number of cooperatives in various counties, especially some ethnic joint cooperatives, have fully exploited the potential of various ethnic groups in reclaiming paddy fields and improving dryland farming techniques, and have continuously achieved leaps forward in production. Yongji County, which belongs to the semi-mountainous area, also has 32 cooperatives that have achieved the target of exceeding 400 jin of grain per mu. Ji'an County, which belongs to the mountainous area, had 13 cooperatives that reached the target stipulated in the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program in the first year of cooperation. In the great debate, many representatives took out their survey data on the production conditions of local well-to-do middle peasants and compared them with the production conditions of the cooperatives, eloquently proving that the collective economy of the agricultural cooperatives has unparalleled superior conditions, and it is entirely possible to catch up with and surpass the production level of well-to-do middle peasants in a short period of time and achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production. After studying the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and discussing the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program among the masses, the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Changchun City believe that due to the superior production conditions in the suburbs of the city, they can catch up with the production level of well-to-do middle peasants in just one or two years, and put forward a production plan to "cross the Yellow River in five years." After reviewing and criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking that the leadership's thinking lags behind reality, the representatives unanimously believed that the production level of well-to-do middle peasants is still a low level, and it is necessary to fully trust the masses, tap production potential, and it is entirely possible to organize a greater leap forward in agricultural production.

The meeting believed that it is necessary to continue to criticize right-leaning conservative thinking, promote revolutionary heroism and a realistic spirit, pool the wisdom and efforts of the masses to tap potential, overcome difficulties, work hard, and strive for increased production year after year. The conference called on agricultural cooperatives to catch up with the production level of well-to-do middle peasants in three to five years; and to strive for more agricultural cooperatives and regions to cross the Yellow River in terms of unit area yield within ten years.

The meeting emphasized that in order to realize the agricultural development plan, the entire Party must be mobilized, all aspects must cooperate and coordinate, and vigorously support the great leap forward in agricultural production. The meeting pointed out that during the first five-year plan, the construction of various key projects of the country in the Jilin region has been completed successively according to plan. In the future, it is necessary to continue to mobilize the people of the province to support the national construction projects; local industries have a considerable foundation in terms of enterprise scale, equipment capacity, and technical strength, and have the conditions to vigorously support the development of agricultural production. According to the central government's policy of developing industry on the basis of developing heavy industry and developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, the meeting decided to take serving agricultural production as the fundamental guideline for the development of local industry. The meeting determined that the focus of local industry in the province during the second five-year plan is: actively developing the chemical industry and related mining industries that serve agricultural production, transforming the machinery industry that serves agricultural production, and continuing to develop wood processing, papermaking, and agricultural, sideline, and local specialty processing industries. In order to support the great leap forward in agricultural production, the First Automobile Factory decided to immediately design and trial-produce gas engines for pumping water, and ensure that 1,000 units will be produced by the end of April, 500 of which will be supplied to the rural areas of Jilin at a lower cost price.

The meeting summarized the achievements of the nationwide rectification movement launched since this summer, and determined the tasks for entering the rectification stage. Wu De, First Secretary of the CPC Jilin Provincial Committee, pointed out in his report to the conference: At present, the struggle against the rightists in the province has achieved a decisive victory, and the movement is developing in a more extensive and in-depth direction, and a new upsurge of improving work is forming in the province. Regarding how to further deepen the rectification, Wu De emphasized in his report: Under the conditions of the victory of the struggle against the rightists, rectification has become our central topic. Whether we are determined to rectify severely is the key to achieving a complete victory in the current rectification movement. The meeting believed that in the stage of focusing on rectification, we should mainly examine and overcome bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism in leadership in terms of the implementation of policies and guidelines. Through rectification, we should strictly examine and criticize the right-leaning conservative thinking that lags behind reality among leaders at all levels, criticize the phenomenon of the decline of revolutionary will among a few Party members and cadres, resolutely oppose and overcome bourgeois individualism, promote revolutionary spirit, establish a strong revolutionary will, and actively promote the development of socialist undertakings with a spirit of not fearing difficulties and indomitable will. The meeting decided that in order to implement the Party's cadre work line, we should vigorously streamline institutions through rectification, and the province should send 100,000 cadres to participate in labor training and grassroots work construction in the countryside and mountains. The meeting demanded that while grasping rectification, we must also guide the self-education and self-transformation movement of people from all walks of life to develop in a more extensive and in-depth direction; at the same time, continue to carry out the struggle against the rightists to a complete victory; we must deeply carry out the two-road struggle between socialism and capitalism, in order to achieve the goal of socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts.

A total of 129 representatives spoke at the conference. The representatives unanimously believed that the formation of the rectification upsurge and the further in-depth development of the nationwide socialist debate will inevitably make the enthusiasm and initiative of the people of all ethnic groups more fully developed and more widely elevated. Party organizations at all levels should become promoters of revolutionary undertakings who are not afraid of difficulties, and turn the nationwide rectification into a driving force for striving for a great leap forward in production and construction. It is necessary to vigorously carry out socialist competition, and promptly guide and organize the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses into the actual actions of the production upsurge and various struggle tasks.

    吉林省党代表大会辩论建设速度
    批判“缓进”　督促“跃进”
    新华社长春31日电　中共吉林省第一届代表大会第二次会议1957年12月20日到28日在长春举行。会议决定：要争取整风运动的全胜，彻底整顿作风，改进工作，以加强党对社会主义事业的领导，把正在形成的生产高潮推向前进，组织生产建设的大跃进，为实现社会主义事业的伟大目标而积极奋斗。
    这次代表大会是在各个战线上反右派斗争取得决定性胜利，各机关正在形成整改高潮，工农业生产正兴起生产高潮的情况下召开的。出席这次大会的有五百八十七名代表，列席会议的有四百二十人。
    会议充分反映了全省广大群众社会主义革命热情的高涨。大会在对政法部门的右倾思想和省高级人民法院院长、右派分子鲍廷干批判斗争中，表现了高度的原则精神。鲍廷干否定我国的无产阶级专政，宣扬资产阶级的政治制度和法律制度，企图取消党对司法工作的领导，攻击党所领导的司法改革、镇反运动。在他的影响下，错放了许多反革命分子和其他刑事犯罪分子。会议一致决议取消鲍廷干的省党代表大会代表的资格，并同意省委关于由所在党组织对他进行严肃的组织处理的建议。会议还对于从实现社会主义三大改造运动之后，一部分党员干部中表现的革命朝气不足的右倾保守思想，展开了有力批判。大会自始至终贯彻了整风精神，表现了饱满的政治热情，党的民主生活显得特别活跃。会上出现了一股新的革命劲头。
    会议着重讨论和修订了吉林省1956年到1967年农业发展规划（修正草案）和1958年农业生产任务。
    会议肯定了第一个五年计划期间吉林省农业生产是前进的，同时指出：由于连年受灾和工作上的缺点，影响了粮食增产的速度。会议认为：由于全省农业合作化的实现，给农业生产力的大发展开辟了最广阔的道路，使农业生产有可能实现一个大跃进。会议要求在今后十年内使粮食（包括大豆）单位面积产量提高一倍，为实现粮食大豆的总产量达到一千万吨的目标而奋斗。即要求从1958年开始，粮食总产量由第一个五年计划时期每年平均总产量五百三十八万吨到1967年达到一千万吨。每市亩土地单位面积产量按平原区、半山区、山区和砂荒区的不同条件，分别达到四百斤，四百五十斤，三百三十斤和二百五十斤。会议指出，这个奋斗目标是积极的，同时又是可靠的，有条件可以实现的。大会要求必须在1958年争取完成生产粮食六百万吨的任务，为保证实现远景规划奠定良好的基础。
    会议以整风和批评自我批评的精神，就农业生产能不能跃进等问题展开了热烈讨论。代表们认为：全省农业合作社两年来在发展生产和战胜自然灾害方面已经显示了巨大的优越性。党内还有一部分干部夸大了过去几年中自然灾害对于完成农业生产计划的影响，往往低估了农业增产的潜力，在群众性农业生产新高潮面前，成为实现农业生产大跃进的主要思想障碍。这种右倾保守思想，在实现全国农业发展纲要修正草案过程中，突出地表现为“跃进”和“缓进”两种思想和两种工作方法的矛盾。来自基层生产单位的代表，举出了许多生动的事例，有力地批判了“小脚女人”的缓进思想。目前吉林全省已经有三分之一以上的农业社在生产上赶上和超过了富裕中农的生产水平。永吉等十三个县就有九十三个社达到和超过了农业发展纲要修正草案规定的每亩产粮四百斤的指标。两年来各县都有大批合作社，特别是一些民族联合社充分发挥了各民族在开改水田和改进旱田耕作技术上的潜力，连续地实现了生产上的跃进。属于半山区的永吉县，也有三十二个社作到了超过每亩产粮四百斤的指标。属于山区的辑安县，合作化第一年就有十三个社达到全国农业发展纲要修正草案规定的指标。许多代表在大辩论中，拿出他们对当地富裕中农生产条件的调查资料同合作社的生产条件作对比，雄辩地证明了农业社集体经济具有无比的优越条件，完全有可能在短期内赶上和超过富裕中农的生产水平，实现农业生产的大跃进。长春市郊区在学习党的八届三中全会精神和在群众中讨论全国农业发展纲要修正草案以后，绝大多数农业社都认为由于市郊区生产条件优越，他们只在一两年内就可赶上富裕中农的生产水平，并且提出“五年越过黄河”的生产规划。代表们在检查和批判了领导思想落后于实际的右倾保守思想以后，一致认为：富裕中农的生产水平还是一个较低的水平，要充分相信群众、发掘生产潜力，完全有可能在农业生产上组织更大的跃进。
    会议认为：今后必须继续批判右倾保守思想，发扬革命英雄气概和求实精神，群策群力地挖掘潜力，克服困难、艰苦奋斗，争取年年增产。大会号召农业社要在三、五年内赶上富裕中农的生产水平；要在十年内争取更多的农业社和地区的单位面积产量越过黄河。
    会议强调要实现农业发展规划，必须全党动员，各方面协作配合，大力支援农业生产的大跃进。会议指出：在第一个五年计划期间，国家在吉林地区的各项重点工程的建设已经按计划相继完成，今后必须继续动员全省人民支援国家建设工程；地方工业在企业规模、设备能力、技术力量上都有了相当基础，有条件大力支援农业生产的发展。会议根据中央在发展重工业基础上发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，决定把为农业生产服务作为指导地方工业发展的根本方针。会议确定全省地方工业在第二个五年计划的重点是：积极发展为农业生产服务的化学工业以及有关的矿山工业，改造为农业生产服务的机械行业，继续发展木材加工、造纸和农、副、土特产加工工业。第一汽车厂为了支援农业生产大跃进，决定立即设计和试制抽水用的煤气发动机，并保证在4月底生产出一千台，其中五百台将以较低的成本价格供应吉林农村使用。
    会议总结了今年夏季以来开展全民整风运动的成就，确定了转入整改阶段的任务。中共吉林省委第一书记吴德在向大会所做的报告中指出：目前，全省反右派斗争已经取得决定性胜利，运动正向着更加广泛深入的方向发展，全省正在形成改进工作的新高潮。关于如何进一步深入整风问题，吴德在报告中强调：在反右派斗争胜利的条件下，整改成了我们的中心课题。是否有决心狠狠地改，是当前整风运动取得全胜的关键。会议认为：在着重整改阶段，主要应该从执行方针政策方面检查和克服领导上的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义。通过整改，严格检查批判各级领导干部中思想落后于实际的右倾保守思想，批判少数党员干部中革命意志衰退的现象，坚决反对和克服资产阶级个人主义，发扬革命朝气，树立坚强的革命意志，以不怕困难和百折不挠的意志，积极促进社会主义事业的发展。会议决定为了贯彻党的干部工作路线，应该通过整改，大力紧缩机构，全省下放十万干部，下乡、上山参加劳动锻炼和基层工作的建设。会议要求：在抓紧整改的同时，还须引导各界人民的自我教育和自我改造运动向更广泛深入的方向发展；同时继续把反右派斗争进行到彻底胜利；必须深入进行社会主义对资本主义的两条道路斗争，以求达到政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的目的。
    在大会发言的代表共达一百二十九人，代表们一致认为：整改高潮的形成和全民社会主义大辩论的进一步深入，必然会使各族人民群众的积极性和主动性更充分的发扬起来和更广泛的高涨起来。各级党组织应该成为不怕困难的革命事业的促进派，要把全民整风变为争取生产建设大跃进的推动力量。要大力开展社会主义竞赛，及时把群众的积极性、主动性引导和组织到生产高潮和各项斗争任务的实际行动中去。
