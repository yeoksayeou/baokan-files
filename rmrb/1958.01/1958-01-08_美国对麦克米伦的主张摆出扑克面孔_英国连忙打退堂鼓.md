Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th: After the British Prime Minister Macmillan's suggestion in his January 4th speech regarding signing a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union was met with a cold reception from the United States government, a British Foreign Office spokesperson hurriedly explained on the 6th: Macmillan's proposal regarding concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union should not be viewed "in isolation," but "must be seen as part of a broader (East-West) solution."

The spokesperson said that the non-aggression treaty could only serve as a "supplement to an agreement on substantive issues" between the East and West. He clarified that the so-called "substantive issues" refer to issues like disarmament, which Western countries have repeatedly obstructed. When answering reporters' questions, he said that the British Prime Minister "certainly does not intend to conclude a non-aggression treaty in isolation." In this way, the official spokesperson virtually admitted that the suggestion was originally largely a cheap propaganda ploy, exposing Macmillan's pose.

The spokesperson also said that Macmillan's mention of a non-aggression treaty "is not a suggestion, but an opinion or proposition." He added, "I don't think there is anything particularly new in this opinion," or that it "indicates any major change in British policy."

According to Agence France-Presse, citing comments from London observers, the British Foreign Office's "explanation" caused Prime Minister Macmillan's suggestion regarding concluding a non-aggression treaty between East and West to be "retracted as soon as it was proposed." Diplomatic observers particularly emphasized that the Foreign Office made this explanation because of the "cold response from the United States."

Diplomatic observers also pointed out that the British government is trying to reduce the impact of Macmillan's proposal for East and West to conclude a non-aggression treaty, because this proposal has already had a greater impact in the world than "many people in London expected," resulting in an "awkward" situation for British officials.

The news pointed out that the Foreign Office's "explanation" also shows that Macmillan's proposal was mainly aimed at public opinion in Britain and in the Commonwealth countries he is about to visit.

According to Agence France-Presse, Washington officials were very pleased after the British Foreign Office spokesperson made this "explanation."

    美国对麦克米伦的主张摆出扑克面孔
    英国连忙打退堂鼓
    新华社7日讯　伦敦消息：在英国首相麦克米伦4日演说中提出的关于同苏联签订互不侵犯条约的建议受到美国政府的冷淡对待以后，英国外交部发言人6日急忙解释说：不应该“孤立地”看待麦克米伦关于同苏联缔结互不侵犯条约的主张，而“必须把它看作是（东西方）更广泛的解决方案的一部分”。
    这位发言人说，互不侵犯条约只能作为东西方“关于实质问题的协议的补充”，他说明所谓“实质问题”指的就是西方国家一再加以阻挠的裁军之类的问题。他在回答记者问题时说，英国首相“确实不打算孤立地缔结一项互不侵犯条约”。这样一来，这位官方发言人就无异于承认这个建议原来在很大程度上只是一种廉价的宣传，给麦克米伦作出的姿态露了底。
    这位发言人还说，麦克米伦提到互不侵犯条约的话“并不是一个建议，而是一个意见或者主张”。他又说，“我不认为这个意见里有什么特别新的东西”，或“表明英国的政策有任何重大改变。”
    据法新社引伦敦观察家的评论说，英国外交部的“解释”使麦克米伦首相关于同苏联缔结互不侵犯条约的建议“刚一提出就被打回了”。外交观察家们特别强调，外交部之所以要作出这样的解释，是由于考虑到“美国的冷淡的反应”。
    外交观察家同时指出：英政府正在设法缩小麦克米伦提出的东西方缔结互不侵犯条约的主张的影响，因为这项主张已经在世界上产生了比“伦敦许多人预料中更大的影响”，结果使英国官方陷入“尴尬”的处境。
    消息指出，外交部的“解释”也表明，麦克米伦提出的这个建议，主要是针对英国国内舆论和他就要去访问的英联邦国家的舆论的。
    据法新社报道，在英国外交部发言人作了这一番“解释”以后，华盛顿官员感到很高兴。
