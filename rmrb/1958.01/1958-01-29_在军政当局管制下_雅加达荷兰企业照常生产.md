    在军政当局管制下
    雅加达荷兰企业照常生产
    据新华社雅加达28日电　到目前为止，雅加达已经有一百二十二个大小荷兰企业置于当地的军政当局正式管制之下。十四家荷兰企业是在政府管制之下，一百零八家是在雅加达军事当局的荷兰企业管制委员会的管制之下。
    军方的荷兰企业管制委员会主任马梅沙少校28日向记者们说明了在雅加达军事当局管制之下的各荷兰企业的情况。他说，已经接管的荷兰企业的生产都在正常进行，它们当中有些企业，例如霍克斯印刷厂，生产已经有了增加。荷兰雇员仍然留在那里照常工作，并没有命令他们离开岗位。从外国输入原料供应这些企业的工作，除原料来自荷兰的以外，都照常进行。
    马梅沙说，雅加达地区还有一百多个大小荷兰企业没有正式置于管制之下。他指出，陆军参谋长所发布的管制所有荷兰企业的命令将逐步实施。
