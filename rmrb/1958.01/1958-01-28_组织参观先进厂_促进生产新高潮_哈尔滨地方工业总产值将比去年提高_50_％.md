Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 27th: Relevant leading departments in Harbin are promoting the typical experiences of organizing production upsurges to promote a new upsurge in the city's industrial production in an all-round way.

Currently, exciting good news is constantly coming from more than two hundred factories throughout the city: municipal and district leading departments receive dozens of production victory reports every day from factories, workshops, and teams that have overfulfilled their January plans. Originally, Harbin's local industry determined that this year's planned total output value would increase by 36% compared to last year's actual output, which was called an adventurous plan by many people. However, after repeated discussions by the workers, tapping potential, and proposing measures, it has now been revised to increase by 50% compared to last year's actual total output value. Factories that originally had problems with sales, raw material supply, and processing capacity have been completely resolved through workers' active trial production of new products, improvement of equipment, and finding new sources of raw materials.

At the beginning of this year, on the basis of the rectification movement, the workers of various factories and enterprises in Harbin boosted their revolutionary spirit, and new records continued to emerge in production, with production quotas being broken one after another. Many factories also used the rectification firepower to solve new key problems encountered in the production upsurge, so the production plan has been raised repeatedly. The experience of the Harbin No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is an example. This factory used methods such as big-character posters and detailed accounting to discuss and formulate production plans for the factory and individuals, focusing firepower on solving key problems such as the disconnection of raw material and drawing supply, so this year the factory's total output value plan will increase by 81% compared to last year without adding any equipment. However, some factories in the city still had conservative ideas in their leadership when formulating production plans, feeling that raw materials and drawings could not keep up with the needs of production development, and lacked confidence, which affected the development of the newly emerging production upsurge. After the experience of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant appeared, the Nangang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party seized this typical factory and immediately organized leading cadres from more than fifty factories and enterprises under its jurisdiction to visit and learn from it. After learning from the experience of the typical factory, the leading cadres of these factories immediately mobilized the workers to check and revise their original conservative plans. After discussion by the workers, the production plans of the factories and enterprises under the Nangang District were quickly increased by more than 30%, and many factories found the way and potential for production leaps and bounds, and launched a heat wave of comparing ambition, drive, and advancement.

The Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party used the experience of Nangang District in promoting the production upsurge to organize leading cadres and workers from factories throughout the city to visit the big-character posters in this district. After their visit, they brought the seeds of the great leap forward in production back to their factories, promoting the development of the production upsurge in various factories throughout the city.

    组织参观先进厂　促进生产新高潮
    哈尔滨地方工业总产值将比去年提高50％
    新华社哈尔滨27日电　哈尔滨市有关领导部门推广组织生产高潮的典型经验，促进全市工业生产新高潮向全面发展。
    现在，全市二百多个工厂里不断传出使人振奋的喜讯：市和区的领导部门每天都接到数十起工厂、车间、小组超额完成1月份计划的生产捷报。原来哈尔滨市地方工业确定今年计划总产值比去年实际提高36％，被许多人称为冒险计划，但是经过职工们一次又一次讨论，挖潜力，提措施，现在已经修订成比去年实际总产值提高50％。原来存在着销路、原料供应和加工能力等问题的工厂，经过职工们积极试制新产品、改进设备和寻找出新的原料来源，都得到了完满的解决。
    今年一开始，哈尔滨市各工厂企业的职工在整风运动的基础上，鼓起革命干劲，生产上不断出现新纪录，生产定额纷纷被突破；不少工厂还运用整改火力，解决了生产高潮中遇到的新的关键问题，因而生产计划一再提高。哈尔滨第一机械厂的经验就是一例。这个厂运用大字报、算细账等方法，讨论制订了工厂和个人的生产计划，集中火力解决原料、图纸供应脱节等关键问题，因而今年这个厂在不增添任何设备的情况下，总产值计划将比去年提高81％。但是全市还有一部分工厂在制订生产计划中，领导上有保守思想，感到原料、图纸跟不上生产发展需要，信心不足，使刚刚冒头的生产高潮的发展受到了影响。第一机械厂经验出现以后，中共南岗区委抓住了这个典型厂，立即组织全区所属的五十多个工厂企业的领导干部前去观摩学习。这些工厂的领导干部学习了典型厂的经验以后，回去立即发动职工，检查和修订了自己原来的保守计划。南岗区所属各工厂企业今年的生产计划经过职工讨论，迅速提高了30％以上，许多工厂找到了生产跃进的门路和潜力，并且展开了比志气、比干劲、比先进的热潮。
    中共哈尔滨市委运用南岗区促进生产高潮的经验，组织全市工厂的领导干部和工人，参观这个区的大字报。他们参观以后，把生产大跃进的种子带回自己的工厂，促进了全市各厂生产高潮的发展。
