Suggest the Ministry of Railways Abolish This Unreasonable Allowance

To improve the lives of its employees, the Ministry of Railways has changed the way it pays for the water, electricity, cook wages, and furniture expenses of employee canteens across the country from self-sufficiency to payment from administrative expenses. I believe this practice is wrong, wastes state funds, and is not in line with the spirit of running enterprises diligently and frugally.

In the past year, our Guangzhou Railway Administration alone has spent 500,000 yuan on this item. Moreover, since then, some unnecessary disputes among some employees have increased instead. Employees with families and the families themselves, who originally cooked their own meals, have now flocked to the canteen for meals, resulting in insufficient canteen staff and equipment, and the problems are getting worse and worse. Later, a restriction was introduced, allowing only single employees to eat, and not employee family members. In practice, this is not feasible, and family members are arguing and making noise in the canteen every day, and the staff cannot enforce this rule. In addition, the staff is not careful in calculation and mistakenly believes that the expenses can be reimbursed anyway. As a result, the canteen management expenses have increased from 21% in 1955 to 27%, while the food has not been improved.

I suggest that the Ministry of Railways resolutely abolish such welfare regulations.

    建议铁道部取消这项不合理的津贴
    铁道部为了改善职工生活，把全国铁路职工食堂的水电、炊事员工资、家具等开支，由自给自足改为由行政费用支付。我认为，这种作法是错误的，浪费了国家资金，不符合勤俭办企业的精神。
    一年来，仅我们广州铁路管理局，这项费用就开支了五十万元。而且，自此以后，部分职工间的一些不必要的纠纷反而增多了。有家属的职工和家属，本来是自己开伙的，这样一来，都纷纷到食堂用饭，造成食堂人员不够，设备不够，问题愈来愈多。后来来了个限制，只准单身职工吃，不准职工家属吃。实际上又行不通，家属天天在食堂吵吵嚷嚷，工作人员也无法执行这项规定。加以工作人员不精打细算，错误地认为费用反正可以报销，于是，食堂管理费用由1955年的21％增加到27％，而伙食并没办好。
    像这样的福利规定，我建议铁道部坚决取消它。
