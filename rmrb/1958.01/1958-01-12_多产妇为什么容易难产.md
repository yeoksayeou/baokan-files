Doctor's Answer

    Why are multiparous women prone to dystocia?
    Comrade Yaoqin:
    The question you ask is precisely what we often encounter in our clinical work. There are many reasons why multiparous women experience dystocia, mainly in the following aspects:
    1. With each pregnancy, the uterus expands, and the abdominal wall also bulges. Although it can shrink somewhat after childbirth, it is difficult to return to its original state. Therefore, with excessive births, the abdominal wall loses its original elasticity. When pregnant again, the abdominal wall cannot support the pressure of the enlarged uterus, and the uterus tilts forward. This affects the position of the fetus in the uterus (the fetus is often prone to lie transversely in the uterus) and the strength of uterine contractions during labor, leading to dystocia.
    2. After multiple pregnancies and deliveries, the uterus also loses its original elasticity. During labor, it is prone to uterine inertia, which delays the delivery time, causing the mother to become physically exhausted or the fetus to be asphyxiated. After childbirth, the uterus often does not contract well, leading to excessive bleeding.
    3. With excessive births, the cervix and pelvic tissues become too loose. During labor, due to the lack of resistance, the delivery is too rapid (medically called "precipitous labor"), which carries the risk of fetal asphyxia or birth canal injury.
    4. Multiple pregnancies result in too many scars in the uterus. Subsequent pregnancies may prevent the embryo from growing in the normal place, causing so-called "abnormal placental position," leading to antepartum hemorrhage or retained placenta during pregnancy or delivery. Some scars may also become the cause of spontaneous uterine rupture during subsequent deliveries.
    5. The nutrients needed for fetal growth in the uterus, such as iron for blood production, protein for muscle growth, and calcium for bone formation, all depend on the mother's supply. If the mother has too many or too closely spaced births, there is not enough time to replenish these nutrients, resulting in supply falling short of demand, leaving both mother and child weakened. In particular, the calcium needed for bone formation is most easily affected. Due to the lack of calcium, the mother may develop osteomalacia, causing the pelvic and lower limb bones to be unable to support the body's weight, leading to bending and deformation, affecting the width of the birth canal, preventing the fetus from passing through, and causing dystocia. After the child is born, it is also difficult to develop and grow normally.
    From the perspective of the health of both mother and child, we should respond to the state's call, practice contraception, and control and plan births.

### 多产妇为什么容易难产

    多产妇为什么容易难产
    瑶琴同志：
    你问的这个问题，也正是我们临床工作中经常遇到的情形。多产妇难产的原因很多，主要有下列几方面：
    一、每次怀孕，子宫就膨大，腹壁也随着臌起来，产后虽然能缩小一些，但很难恢复原状。因此，生育过多，腹壁就失去原来的弹性。再怀孕时，腹壁就不能支持胀大子宫的压力，子宫就向前倾倒。这样一方面会影响胎儿在子宫内的位置（胎儿常常容易横在子宫内），另一方面会影响分娩时子宫收缩的力量，造成难产。
    二、子宫经过多次的怀孕和分娩，也会失去原有的弹性，在分娩时容易发生收缩无力的现象，延迟分娩的时间，使母亲体力不支或胎儿窒息。产后，子宫还往往收缩不好，发生流血过多的现象。
    三、生育过多，子宫口和骨盆组织太松，分娩时因缺少阻力而过速产出（医学上叫做“急产”），有胎儿窒息或产道损伤等危险。
    四、多次怀胎，子宫内疤痕过多，再怀孕时就会使胚胎不能在正常的地方生长，造成所谓“胎盘位置异常”，在孕期或分娩中发生产前流血或胎盘不下等症状。有的疤痕还可能成为以后分娩中子宫自然破裂的原因。
    五、胎儿在子宫内生长所需的养料，如生血的铁、长肉的蛋白质以及制造骨胳的钙等，都要靠母体供给。如果母亲生育过多或过密，就来不及补充上述养料，求过于供，弄得母、子都衰弱不堪。其中尤以造成骨胳的钙最易受影响。由于钙的缺乏，母亲会骨质软化，使骨盆和下肢长骨支持不了身体的重量而发生弯曲和变形，影响产道的宽度，阻止胎儿的通过，发生难产。而孩子出生后，也难于正常地发育和生长。
    就从母、子两代的健康这一点讲，也应该响应国家号召，实行避孕，节制和有计划地生育。
