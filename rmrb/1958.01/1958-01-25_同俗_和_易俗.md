    "Conforming to Customs" and "Changing Customs"
    Bai Dongqiao, Brick Factory, Botou, Hebei
    Most intellectuals who go to the countryside and mountains have encountered such things. For example, your landlord's aunt or sister-in-law may be very dirty, wiping a child's runny nose with her sleeve or wiping urine from the bed with her hand. What do you feel when you see this? I have seen two kinds of people: Some say, "I shudder all over when I see it, feel very uncomfortable, and can't help but turn my face away and cover my nose." Others say, "To transform one's own feelings into the feelings of the peasants, one must be able to get used to all their customs."
    The former is indeed the sourness of the old intellectuals, which is undesirable; the latter, although the determination to transform oneself is commendable, this view of aiming at and being satisfied with "conforming to customs" is also undesirable.
    It is true that intellectuals going to the countryside and mountains have a significant meaning in transforming their own thinking, but at the same time, it also has the meaning of changing customs and habits. This point must not be ignored. It is a fact that peasants have not all developed sanitary habits. We should know that this is a legacy of the old society of thousands of years. We should not "get used to" it, but should gradually change it.
    I met a primary school teacher. In order to make a primary school student who often did not wipe his runny nose hygienic, she used her own handkerchief to wipe it for the student. After only wiping it twice, the student loved cleanliness forever. Comrades who go to the countryside can get inspiration from this teacher's actions, take the lead in paying attention to environmental hygiene, and use all possible methods to educate and guide the masses to pay attention to hygiene. Doing so can not only change the unhealthy habits of the masses, but also be welcomed by them. There are many successful examples of this. You might as well try it.
    Let us all take on the responsibility of changing customs, changing old habits, and establishing new customs.

### “同俗”和“易俗”

    “同俗”和“易俗”
    河北泊头砖厂　白东桥
    上山下乡的知识分子大都遇到过这样的事，比如说，你的房东大娘或大嫂也许很脏，见孩子流了鼻涕而用袖子去擦，孩子尿了炕用手去抹，你见到这种情形有何感觉？我见到过这样两种人：有人说：“一见就浑身起栗，非常不舒服，不能不扭脸掩鼻而过”。另外一种人却说：“要改造自己的感情成为农民的感情，就得看得惯他们的一切习俗”。
    前者固然是旧知识分子的那股酸味，要不得的；后者呢，虽然改造自己的决心是可贵的，但这种以“同俗”为目的、为满足的观点，也是要不得的。
    知识分子下乡上山固然有着改造自己思想的重大意义，但与此同时还有着移风易俗的意义。这一点也绝对不能忽视。农民还没都养成卫生习惯，这是事实，我们应该知道这是几千年旧社会给遗留下来的，我们不应“习惯”它，应该逐步地去改变它。
    我遇到过一位小学教师，为了使一位经常不擦鼻涕的小学生讲卫生，她用自己的手帕给这个学生擦，只擦了两次，这个学生就永远爱清洁了。下乡的同志可以从这位教师的行动中得到启示，以身作则注意起环境卫生，利用一切可能利用的方法教育、引导群众讲求卫生，这样做既能改变群众不卫生的习惯，也会受到他们欢迎，这样成功的例子很多，你不妨试一试。
    让我们都负起移风易俗的责任来，改变旧习俗，树立新风尚。
