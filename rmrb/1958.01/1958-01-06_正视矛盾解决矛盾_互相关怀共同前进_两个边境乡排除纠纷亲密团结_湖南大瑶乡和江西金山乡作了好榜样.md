Face Contradictions, Resolve Contradictions, Care for Each Other, and Advance Together
Two Border Townships Eliminate Disputes and Unite Closely
Hunan's Da Yao Township and Jiangxi's Jinshan Township Set a Good Example

(Our Reporter Gao Changren reports) Border townships belonging to two provinces and two counties – Jinshan Township in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, and Da Yao Township in Liuyang County, Hunan Province – have recently strengthened their ties, eliminated misunderstandings, and enhanced unity. They have also resolved many specific issues related to farmers' production and livelihoods.

The locations of the Township People's Committees of Jinshan Township and Da Yao Township are only twenty-five *li* apart, and the highway from Changsha to Nanchang also passes through these two townships. Although the two townships are under the jurisdiction of two provinces and two counties, the economic ties between the farmers of the two townships are very close. The natural conditions for agricultural production are the same, and the main projects of sideline production are roughly the same. The production of ramie cloth and firecrackers are the main sideline industries of both townships. The policies and measures of Jiangxi Province and Hunan Province are consistent in principle. However, when specifically implemented in these two townships, there are slight differences. For example, in 1956, the price of pork in Pingxiang County was more than ten yuan higher per hundred *jin* than in Liuyang County. As a result, live pigs from Liuyang continuously flowed to Pingxiang. Some farmers even put live pigs in sedan chairs and carried them from Liuyang County to Pingxiang County. This was a relatively large difference and was quickly resolved through consultation by the leading organs. However, there were still many specific problems that were not noticed by the leading organs. Although these were relatively minor issues, they had a significant impact on the farmers in the border areas. Many people reflected, "Is Jiangxi led by one Chairman Mao, and Hunan by another Chairman Mao?" These two sentences sharply criticized the lack of coordination in specific work in the border areas of the two provinces.

Although the two townships are very close, the township cadres of both sides have never taken the initiative to contact each other in the past. They generally only one-sidedly understood some of the other party's situation from hearsay among the masses, and when problems arose, they only reported to their superiors for solutions. Although there was nothing wrong with doing so, often very small problems could have been quickly resolved if the two townships could have understood each other's situations and consulted with each other, but they were dragged on.

Recently, two more incidents occurred in these two townships. One was that some members of Jinshan Township went to their own forests located in Da Yao territory to cut down trees and were detained by members of Da Yao Township. Some members of Jinshan Township then gathered together to forcibly seize them, and some members of Da Yao Township also gathered people to prepare to deal with the "forced seizure." The other was that members of Da Yao Township went to their own tea-oil forests located in Jinshan Township to pick tea-oil seeds. Because the boundary was unclear, they picked too many, which caused another dispute. Although these two disputes were quelled by the efforts of the two Township People's Committees, they were still dealt with in a piecemeal manner.

In order to proactively and fundamentally (that is, the two townships taking the initiative to contact each other and jointly consult) solve the problem, the Liuyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed the Party branch of Da Yao Township to take the initiative to conduct a friendly contact with Jinshan Township in Pingxiang County to negotiate and resolve some specific issues.

On December 25, 1957, the Party branch secretary of Da Yao Township led six cadres (including three financial and economic cadres) to visit Jinshan Township. In Jinshan Township, they were warmly received. The two sides reviewed the shortcomings of insufficient contact in the past, exchanged experiences in leading production, and finally raised common problems. They initially negotiated solutions, drew up a preliminary plan, and submitted it to the leading organs of the two counties for approval and immediate implementation. At the same time, they planned to conduct another contact on January 10 and fixed this contact method.

Among the problems initially solved, the first was to solve the problem of inter-planted fields on the border between the two provinces. Because the soil quality varied, agricultural cooperatives were unwilling to exchange them during the collectivization movement, and this has been delayed until now. After consultation, the heads of the two townships basically agreed to organize exchanges. The specific methods will be resolved by the relevant agricultural cooperatives. The mountain and forest problem not only has inter-planting, but it was also discovered that some members used the weakness of the past border between the two provinces and the lack of understanding of the situation in their own commune to conceal many scattered mountains and forests from joining the commune. As a result of this consultation, scattered mountains and forests spanning provincial and county boundaries were all converted into commune shares at local prices. The mountain price was favorable in order to avoid indiscriminate deforestation. A unified management plan was also made for the phenomenon of a few farmers in the two places taking advantage of loopholes to engage in speculative business.

The financial and economic cadres who came from Da Yao Township took the initiative to review their shortcomings with the financial and economic cadres of Jinshan Township. A cadre of a supply and marketing cooperative branch in Da Yao Township, in order to complete the task of purchasing firecrackers, used the method of raising prices to make some firecrackers from Pingxiang flow into Da Yao. Similarly, the purchase price of ramie cloth in Jinshan Township was high, and the ramie cloth purchase task in Da Yao could not be completed. Everyone reviewed the capitalist management ideology and ensured that in future specific work, they would also take into account each other's difficulties. Some issues that belonged to the resolution of their respective higher-level departments were also reported, and plans were proposed for approval.

In addition to some specific problems that were initially solved, the two sides also learned many work experiences from exchanging information. Da Yao Township originally did not strictly manage slaughtering work, and some piglets weighing less than one hundred *jin* were also killed. Jinshan Township, on the other hand, did not have this phenomenon because of strict management. The Party branch secretary of Da Yao Township said that he would learn from Jinshan Township's methods. The cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative of Jinshan Township were often troubled by the failure to complete the cotton sales task. Many farmers went to the Da Yao Township supply and marketing cooperative to buy cotton. After exchanging experiences, it turned out that the working methods of the Jinshan Township supply and marketing cooperative were not correct, while the supply methods of Da Yao Township were welcomed by the masses. The financial and economic cadres of Jinshan Township said that they would improve their work in 1958, and the financial and economic cadres of Da Yao Township also said that they would control supplies so as not to make the financial and economic work of Jinshan Township passive.

This friendly contact between the two townships was very fruitful, and everyone was very satisfied. They all expressed that they would support and help each other in their work in the future.

    正视矛盾解决矛盾　互相关怀共同前进
    两个边境乡排除纠纷亲密团结
    湖南大瑶乡和江西金山乡作了好榜样
    本报讯　记者高长任报道：属于两个省、两个县的边境乡——江西省萍乡县的金山乡和湖南省浏阳县的大瑶乡的乡干部，最近加强了联系，消除了隔阂，增进了团结，还解决了许多和农民生产、生活有关的具体问题。
    金山乡和大瑶乡的乡人民委员会的所在地，相距只有二十五里，长沙到南昌的公路，也穿过这两个乡。虽然两个乡分属两个省、两个县管辖，但两乡农民之间在经济上的联系非常密切。农业生产的自然条件相同，副业生产的主要项目也大体一致。生产夏布和鞭炮都是这两个乡的主要副业。江西省和湖南省的政策、措施，在原则上都是一致的。但具体贯彻到这两个乡的时候，便略有不同。如1956年曾发生过这样的事情：萍乡县猪肉的价格，每百斤高于浏阳县十多元，因此，浏阳的生猪不断向萍乡流去，有的农民把生猪放在花轿里，从浏阳县境抬到萍乡县境。这是比较大的差异，很快就由领导机关协商解决了。但是还有许多具体问题，没有被领导机关所注意。虽然这些都是比较微小的问题，但对边境地方的农民却影响很大。不少群众反映：“难道江西是一个毛主席领导的，湖南又是一个毛主席领导的？”这两句话尖锐地批评了两个省边界地区在具体工作上没有协作的缺点。
    这两个乡虽然距离很近，但双方的乡干部过去从来没有主动进行过联系。他们一般都是从群众口传中片面了解一些对方的情况，有问题了，也只是打报告给自己的上级来解决。这样做虽然没有错误，但往往有些很小的问题，只要两个乡能互相了解情况，互相协商就可以很快解决，但也拖下来了。
    最近，这两个乡又发生两起事情。一起是金山乡有的社员到插在大瑶境内的自己的树林里砍伐树木，被大瑶乡的社员们扣留了。金山乡有的社员就纠合起来要硬抢，大瑶乡有些社员也在纠合人准备对付“硬抢”。另一起是大瑶乡的社员们到插在金山乡境内的自己的油茶林去采油茶子，因交界不清，采的多了，又引起一场纠纷。这两场纠纷虽然在两个乡人民委员会的努力下，平息了，但仍是头痛医头，脚痛医脚的办法。
    中共浏阳县委为了主动地，能够从根本上（即两个乡主动联系，共同协商）解决问题，指示大瑶乡的党总支主动到萍乡县的金山乡进行一次友谊的联系，协商并解决一些具体问题。
    1957年12月25日，大瑶乡的党总支书记带领六名干部（其中有三名是财经干部）到金山乡访问。在金山乡，他们受到热情的接待。双方检查了过去联系不够的缺点，交流了当前领导生产的经验。最后提出了共同存在的问题，初步协商出解决问题的办法，订了一个初步方案，报请两个县的领导机关批准后立即执行。同时计划在1月10日再进行一次联系，并将这种联系的办法固定起来。
    在初步解决的问题中，首先是解决两省交界的插花田问题。因为土质好坏不一，合作化运动中农业社都不愿兑换，一直拖到现在。两个乡负责人经协商后，基本上同意组织兑换，具体办法，再由有关的农业社来解决。山林问题不仅也存在着插花的情况，而且发现有的社员利用过去两省交界、本社不了解情况的弱点，隐瞒了不少零星的山林没有入社。这次协商结果，跨省界、县界的零星山林都就地折价入社，山价从优，以避免乱伐森林。对于两地少数农民钻空子搞投机生意的现象，也作了统一的管理方案。
    从大瑶乡去的财经干部们，主动向金山乡财经干部检讨了自己的缺点。大瑶乡有个供销社分销店的干部为了完成收购鞭炮的任务，用提高价格的办法，使萍乡的一部分鞭炮流入大瑶。同样，金山乡收购夏布的价格高，大瑶的夏布收购任务也不能完成。大家检查了资本主义的经营思想，保证在今后具体工作中，也照顾到对方的困难。有些属于各自上级部门解决的问题，也都打了报告，提出方案，请求批准。
    除了初步解决的一些具体问题以外，双方从交流情况中，还互相学习了许多工作经验。大瑶乡原来对屠宰工作管理不严，有些百斤以下的小猪也杀了，金山乡则因管理严格，就没有这种现象。大瑶乡总支书记表示要学习金山乡的办法。金山乡的供销社干部经常为完不成棉花销售任务而苦恼，许多农民都到大瑶乡供销社买棉花。经过交流经验，原来是金山乡供销社的工作方法不对头，而大瑶乡的供应办法则为群众欢迎。金山乡的财经干部表示要在1958年改进工作，大瑶乡的财经干部也表示要控制供应，不使金山乡的财经工作被动。
    这次两个乡的友谊的联系，收获很大，大家都很满意，都表示今后在工作上互相支援、互相帮助。
