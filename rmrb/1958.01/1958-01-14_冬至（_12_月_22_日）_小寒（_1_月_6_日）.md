    Semi-Monthly Agricultural Situation

    Winter Solstice (December 22) - Minor Cold (January 6)
    Afforestation is an important part of winter production in rural areas. During this period, winter afforestation in many areas of the South continues. According to a report from Jiangsu Province on January 6th, the province has completed more than 456,500 mu of large-scale afforestation, accounting for more than 83% of the winter and spring afforestation tasks. While carrying out large-scale afforestation, the province also mobilized the masses to plant more than 98 million trees "around houses, villages, roads, and rivers".
    Some areas, in order to conserve water sources, are building water conservancy projects and planting trees simultaneously. Huangbai District of Qianshan County, Anhui Province, has planted pine, cypress, and willow trees around newly built ponds, weirs, and small-scale water conservancy sites, achieving "greening wherever water conservancy is built".
    Water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and soil improvement remain the central content of agricultural activities in most areas. Many provinces have made rapid progress in water conservancy construction. Gansu, Shaanxi, and Anhui provinces had already completed their original 1958 annual tasks nine months ahead of schedule by late December. As of January 2nd, Guangxi Province had a total of 55,563 water conservancy projects under construction, with a total irrigation area of 8,799,100 mu, an increase of 12,294 projects and 1,098,103 mu of irrigation area compared to a week earlier, exceeding the province's original plan by 72.1%.
    Many advanced areas have added to this year's water conservancy construction tasks. Anhui originally planned a total annual water conservancy task of 800 million cubic meters, but later doubled it; more than half of the added portion had already been completed by January 6th. After conducting a major water conservancy inspection on January 1st, some areas of Hunan Province also added tasks according to the demands of the masses.
    The winter planting task in subtropical regions was basically completed before the "Winter Solstice". Hainan District of Guangdong planted more than 1.4 million mu before the "Winter Solstice", completing 80% of the winter planting task. The progress of winter planting in this area is generally faster than in the previous year; however, a few areas have been slow to progress due to the influence of the idea that "it's still early in the season, take your time". In counties such as Ya County and Lingshui, only about 30% of winter planting was completed by the "Winter Solstice". Most winter crops generally emerge quickly and grow well in warm and rainy conditions, and have entered the field management stage.
    Several counties in the Hainan District with earlier seasons are busy with early rice transplanting during this stage. Early rice transplanting in Qiongdong County has largely ended. Lehui County had transplanted more than 28,400 mu by late December last year, and it is expected to be fully completed by mid-January. The transplanting period here this year is generally earlier than in previous years. In Qiongdong County, transplanting often dragged on until after the "Major Cold" in previous years, but this year it has been advanced by half a month. Other areas of Hainan need to cultivate seedling fields during this stage to prepare for early rice transplanting.
    Spring has also come to some areas of Yunnan. In early January, cherry blossoms in Simao County were already in full bloom, and lush green seedlings covered the seedling fields.

### 冬至（12月22日）——小寒（1月6日）

    冬至（12月22日）——小寒（1月6日）
    植树造林是农村冬季生产的一个重要内容。在这个时期，南方许多地区的冬季造林仍在继续进行。据江苏省1月6日的汇报，全省已完成大片造林四十五万六千五百多亩，占冬春造林任务的83％多。这个省在大片造林的同时，还发动群众“四旁”植树九千八百多万株。
    有些地区为了涵养水源，一面兴修水利，一面植树造林。安徽潜山县黄柏区已在新修的塘、堰和小型水利工地周围植上松、柏和柳树，作到“修一处水利绿化一处”。
    兴修水利、积肥和改良土壤仍是绝大部分地区农业活动的中心内容。不少省份兴修水利的进度较快。甘肃、陕西、安徽三省在12月下旬已经提前九个月完成了原定的1958年全年的任务。广西省到1月2日全省已开工的水利工程共有五万五千五百六十三处、共有灌溉面积八百七十九万九千一百多亩，比一个星期以前多了一万二千二百九十四处、多了灌溉面积一百零九万八千一百零三亩，超过省原定计划72.1％。
    不少先进地区追加了今年兴修水利任务。安徽原定全年水利任务是八亿公方，后来又追加了一倍；追加的部分到1月6日为止又已经完成了一半以上。湖南省一些地方在1月1日作了水利大检查后，也根据群众要求追加了任务。
    亚热带地区的冬种任务已在“冬至”以前基本完成。广东海南区“冬至”前种了一百四十多万亩，完成冬种任务的80％。这个地区的冬种进度一般比前一年为快；但少数地区由于受到“季节还早，慢慢来”思想的影响，进度迟缓，崖县、陵水等县的冬种到“冬至”才完成30％左右。多数冬种作物在气候温暖雨水匀调情况下一般出土迅速，生长良好，已进入田间管理阶段。
    海南区季节较早的几个县，在这个阶段正忙于早稻插秧。琼东县早稻插秧已大部结束。乐会县到去年12月下旬已插完二万八千四百多亩，预计1月中旬可全部完成。今年这里的插秧期一般比往年为早，琼东县往年插秧常常拖到“大寒”以后，今年提早了半个月。海南的另一些地区要在这个阶段里培育秧田，为早稻插秧作好准备。
    春天也来到了云南的一些地区。在1月初，思茅县的樱花已经盛开，葱绿的幼苗布满了秧田。
