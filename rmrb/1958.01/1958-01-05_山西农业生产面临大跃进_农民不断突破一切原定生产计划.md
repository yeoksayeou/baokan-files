Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th — Shanxi Province is currently brewing a Great Leap Forward movement in agricultural production. A gratifying phenomenon is appearing in various townships and communes where the agricultural production increase plans formulated exceed the provincial and county targets, and the actual actions of farmers break through all pre-determined plans.

The province's winter and spring plans for developing water conservancy and afforestation have already been completed last winter, and new demands have now been put forward. The Changzhi Special District originally requested the expansion of paddy fields by 400,000 mu, but the broad masses of farmers completed the expansion of 610,000 mu of paddy fields as soon as they started, exceeding the original plan by 52%. Now, the counties have set targets equal to 3.7 times the initial plan.

This conservative and slow phenomenon of leadership lagging behind the masses has attracted the attention of leading organs at all levels, and they have begun to examine and correct it. At the provincial planning conference deciding on this year's agricultural development targets, after conducting a thorough investigation and assessment by county units, and criticizing negative, self-deprecating, satisfied-with-gradual-progress, and simply relying on the state's erroneous thinking, the province's total grain output has been revised from the original 8.9 billion jin to 9.5 billion jin. The counties have also generally revised the targets required by the province according to local conditions. Pingshun County in the Taihang Mountains proposed a grain yield of 400 jin per mu, exceeding the provincial allocation target by 29%. Xiangning, Ji County, Yonghe, Pianguan, Kelan, and the Yanqu district, which are relatively poor in natural conditions and rely on the Yellow River, and other backward counties in production, have also proposed higher production increase targets than the province. National model workers Li Shunda and Wu Houli, who lead the Jinxing and Hongxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Livestock Cooperatives in Pingshun County, both loudly put forward the slogan "Crossing the Yellow River" after achieving the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, demanding that this year's per mu yield reach 550 jin and 500 jin respectively. The agricultural cooperatives where famous cotton-growing models Qu Yaoli and Wu Chun'an are located have also proposed producing 100 to 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu, promoting a great leap forward in cotton production.

### 山西农业生产面临大跃进  农民不断突破一切原定生产计划

    山西农业生产面临大跃进
    农民不断突破一切原定生产计划
    新华社太原4日电　山西省各地目前正在酝酿掀起农业生产大跃进运动，一些乡、社制定的农业增产计划超过省、县指标，农民实际行动又突破一切预订计划的可喜现象纷纷出现。
    全省冬春两季发展水利和植树造林计划，已经在去年冬季完成，目前又提出了新的要求。长治专区原来要求扩大水田四十万亩，但广大农民刚刚开始行动，就完成了扩大水地六十一万亩的工程，超过原计划52％。现在，各县又订出等于最初计划三点七倍的指标。
    这种领导落后于群众的保守迟缓现象，已引起各级领导机关的重视，开始检查纠正。在决定今年农业发展指标的全省计划会议上，经过以县为单位摸底排队，检查批判消极自卑、满足渐进和单纯依赖国家等错误思想，全省粮食总产量已由原订八十九亿斤修订为九十五亿斤。各县又根据当地的条件，普遍修订了省里要求的指标。太行山区平顺县提出每亩产粮四百斤，超过省分配指标的29％。自然条件较差、靠黄河的乡宁、吉县、永和、偏关、岢岚和生产落后的垣曲等县，也提出比省里为高的增产指标。全国著名劳动模范李顺达、武侯梨领导的平顺县金星和红星农林牧合作社，都在提前实现全国农业发展纲要指标后，响亮地提出“过黄河”的口号，要求今年亩产量分别达到五百五十斤和五百斤。著名植棉模范曲耀离和吴春安所在的农业社，也提出每亩产皮棉一百到一百五十斤，推动棉花生产大跃进。
