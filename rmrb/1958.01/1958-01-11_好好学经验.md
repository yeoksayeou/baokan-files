Study Experience Well
	Wan Xiangxin
	Chairman Mao once put forward a glorious task to the whole Party in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": to acquire experience in economic construction in a shorter period of time and at a lower cost.
	Xi'an city's conscientious summing up of the construction experience of the first Five-Year Plan is an important step for them to realize this task.
	Chairman Mao said in this speech: "We still lack experience in economic construction, because it has only been carried out for seven years, and we still need to accumulate experience. ... We demand that the time taken to acquire experience in economic construction be shorter than the time taken to acquire revolutionary experience, and at the same time, we should not pay such a high price. A price is always needed, but we hope that it will not be as high as the price paid during the revolutionary period." He also pointed out that there is a contradiction in this issue, which is the contradiction between the objective laws of economic development in socialist society and our subjective understanding. This contradiction needs to be resolved in practice.
	Our country's first Five-Year Plan has already achieved brilliant success and accumulated a lot of successful experience. However, like sunspots in the sun, some shortcomings have also occurred in our work; this has also given us some experience of failure.
	Take Xi'an city as an example. During the five years, dozens of large-scale industrial enterprises were newly built and expanded here, turning this ancient city with an extremely weak industrial base into an industrial city with considerable productive power. In the process of construction, a large number of construction talents grew up, starting from novices and becoming skilled workers. However, upon inspection, there are still some imperfections, such as insufficient attention to cooperation, and some engineering construction standards being too high, and so on. There is no need to be alarmed by these shortcomings. Because to master the laws of socialist economic development and gain experience in economic construction requires repeated practice and repeated research. We have just begun planned economic construction, and shortcomings and errors are certainly unavoidable. At the same time, these shortcomings are minor compared to our unprecedented achievements. This is our basic attitude in estimating the shortcomings in the first five-year economic construction. However, we must never ignore these shortcomings. Because these shortcomings and the losses caused by them are precisely the price we paid in the process of accumulating experience. If you spend money, you have to buy smarts, and if you pay the price, you have to learn from the experience. A careful analysis of the causes of the shortcomings will inevitably enable us to draw many useful lessons from them and ensure that we make fewer or no mistakes in the future.
	Whether viewed from a region or from the whole country, the experience gained in the first five years is valuable and rich. This experience gained from practice is the most practical teaching material. In order to realize Chairman Mao's instruction to acquire experience in economic construction in a shorter period of time and at a lower cost, all localities, departments, and units should, like Xi'an City, conscientiously and systematically summarize these experiences, and practically use them to guide current and future work. Through such continuous and repeated efforts, we will be able to improve our ability to lead economic construction more quickly, and engage in our great socialist construction in a way that is more, faster, better and more economical.

    好好学经验

    毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这一讲演中曾经向全党提出了一个光荣的任务：用较短的时间、较低的代价取得经济建设的经验。
    西安市认真总结第一个五年计划的建设经验，这是他们实现这一任务的一个重要步骤。
    毛主席在这篇讲演中说：“经济建设我们还缺乏经验，因为才进行七年，还需要积累经验。……我们要求在取得经济建设方面的经验，比较取得革命经验的时间要缩短一些，同时不要花费那么高的代价。代价总是需要的，就是希望不要有革命时期所付的代价那么高。”他还指出：在这个问题上是存在着矛盾的，这就是社会主义社会经济发展的客观规律和我们主观认识之间的矛盾。这个矛盾需要在实践中去解决。
    我国第一个五年计划，已经取得了辉煌的成就，积累了许多成功的经验。但是，像太阳中的黑点一样，我们的工作中也发生过一些缺点；这也使我们获得了一些失败的经验。
    拿西安市的情况来看。五年当中，这里新建和扩建了几十个大型工业企业，使这座工业基础极为薄弱的古城变成了一座生产力相当强大的工业城市。在建设过程中，大批大批的建设人材成长起来，由生手开始变成熟手。但是，检查起来，也还有一些美中不足的地方，诸如对协作注意不够，有些工程建筑标准偏高，等等。对于这些缺点，不必大惊小怪。因为要掌握社会主义经济的发展规律，取得经济建设经验，需要经过反复的实践和反复的研究。我们刚刚开始进行有计划的经济建设，缺点和错误肯定是难免的。同时，这些缺点比起我们史无前例的成就来是很次要的。这是我们估量第一个五年经济建设中的缺点的基本态度。但是，我们也绝不可以忽视这些缺点。因为这些缺点和由此而造成的损失，正是我们在积累经验过程中付出的代价。花了钱就要买乖，付出了代价就要学得经验。认真分析缺点产生的原因，必然会使我们从中吸取许多有益的教训，保证今后少犯或不犯错误。
    无论从一个地区来看，或是从全国来看，第一个五年取得的经验都是宝贵而丰富的。这些从实践中得来的经验，是最为实际的教材。为了实现毛主席提出的用较短的时间、较低的代价取得经济建设经验的指示，各个地方、各个部门、各个单位都应该像西安市那样，认真地、系统地总结这些经验，并且切实地拿它们指导当前和今后的工作。经过这样不断的反复的努力，我们就能较快地提高领导经济建设的本领，又多又快又好又省地从事我们伟大的社会主义建设。
