Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Guizhou Province has basically become self-sufficient and has a surplus of edible oil. From 1953 to mid-December 1957, more than 25,000 tons of rapeseed oil and tea oil have been shipped out of the province. In the past week, batches of edible oil have been transported daily along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway to major cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan to meet the needs of local residents.
    
    Over the past five years, the planting area of rapeseed and peanuts in Guizhou Province has been expanding year by year. Last year, the rapeseed planting area reached 3.63 million mu, an increase of 2.3 times compared with 1952, and the total output ranked second in the country, second only to Sichuan. At the same time, mountainous farmers also reclaimed and newly planted 600,000 mu of oil tea forests last year. As a result, the consumption level of edible vegetable oil for people in mountainous areas last year increased by about two times compared with 1952.

    贵州油料自给有余
    新华社讯　贵州省食油已经基本上自给有余。从1953年到1957年12月中旬止，外调的菜油、茶油已有二万五千多吨。最近一周来，每天都有成批的食油沿黔桂铁路运往上海、广州、武汉等大城市，供应当地居民需要。
    贵州省五年来油菜籽、花生的播种面积逐年扩大。去年油菜籽播种面积达三百六十三万亩，比1952年增加二点三倍，总产量仅次于四川占全国第二位。同时，山区农民去年还垦复和新造了油茶林六十万亩。因而去年山区人民食用植物油消费水平，已比1952年增长约二倍。
