Recycling and utilizing discarded materials is a good tradition we have always had in our country and a concrete measure to implement the policy of building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift. Since the founding of the country, with the restoration and development of the national economy and the gradual improvement of people's living standards, the waste products and scraps from industrial and mining enterprises and the public have gradually increased; at the same time, the departments that need discarded materials are also increasing. Some large industries such as metal manufacturing, rubber, papermaking, and bone fertilizer factories, etc., utilize waste materials as an important source of production raw materials; in handicrafts, a large part of the raw materials has always been waste and old materials. After the cooperatives were formed, productivity increased, and the need for waste products and scraps also increased. In addition, some waste products and their finished products are also export goods, or objects managed by social service industries.

Under the correct leadership of the Party and the government and the support of the masses, the recycling and utilization of discarded materials has been organized and carried out nationwide in the past few years. According to statistics, the varieties acquired by the supply and marketing cooperatives have increased from three or five kinds at the beginning in 1952 to the current five or six hundred kinds, of which more than 80% are industrial raw materials; the total amount acquired during the first five-year plan period reached more than 4.26 million tons, and in 1957 it increased to six times that of 1953.

Collecting and utilizing things that were originally discarded has significant political and economic significance. The following examples fully illustrate this:

The waste copper acquired over the years is equivalent to mining and smelting ore from more than 610,000 train carriages. The 1.65 million tons of waste steel acquired in five years, if returned to the furnace for steelmaking, is equivalent to the total steel output of 1952. In the four years from 1954 to 1957, the paper industry used more than 390,000 tons of waste fibers such as rags, rope ends, fishing nets, and waste paper, saving wood that could be used to build four and a half Baoji-Chengdu railways, and greatly reducing the cost of papermaking. The state-owned Shandong Paper Mill changed the raw materials for cigarette paper from 60% flax to 30% waste fishing nets and 30% waste rope ends, and after a series of technical and organizational improvements, it not only relatively increased the output by more than 1,800 tons in the past five years, but also reduced the unit cost of cigarette paper from more than 2,600 yuan to more than 1,400 yuan.

Recycling and utilizing discarded materials is also significantly increasing people's income. From 1955 to 1957 alone, the acquisition of waste products directly increased people's income by more than 950.7 million yuan. Youban Agricultural Cooperative in Suian County, Zhejiang Province, sold waste products for 755 yuan in one go for 162 households, an average increase of 4.66 yuan per household.

The broad masses have given great support to the work of acquiring waste products. With the support of the masses and the assistance of relevant units, the Tianjin Waste Products Management Office has excavated and recovered 348 tons of miscellaneous copper from the copper soil abandoned and buried underground from the old society in the past two years; a cooperative in Beijing extracted 320,000 jin of industrial oil from leftovers, bottom oil, and ditch mud from various units in one year, which is equivalent to the oil yield of 2 million jin of soybeans. Many local supply and marketing cooperatives also paid attention to selecting parts from waste products and assembling them into items. In 1956 alone, Shanghai, Harbin, Qingdao, Chongqing and other places assembled 37 automobiles from broken cars and waste parts and put them into the transportation front.

The expansion of the scope of waste product recycling and utilization in the past few years is inseparable from the close cooperation and mutual support of industry, commerce and other related parties. However, it should be admitted that there are still many potentially utilizable waste products that have not been fully recycled and utilized. Some waste products have abundant resources, but due to certain technical measures, cost accounting and other problems that have not been resolved in the industrial or commercial sectors, the recycling and utilization of waste products are affected. More importantly, some units are affected by conservative ideas that "only use new materials and not waste materials" and are afraid of trouble, which also affects the recycling and utilization of waste products. For example, waste glass, waste batteries, waste felt pieces, waste plastics, etc. can be utilized a lot, but the actual recycling and utilization is very small, which is the reason.

In order to closely integrate acquisition and production, so as to recycle and utilize waste materials more and better, it is necessary to strengthen leadership, especially when industrial and commercial systems are being reformed, some departmental enterprises are handed over to local leadership. However, many waste products and scraps are purchased in a decentralized manner and utilized centrally in a few areas, so we must pay more attention to the connection and balance between acquisition, supply and production and utilization. Therefore, on the basis of fully mobilizing local enthusiasm, we should pay attention to organizing the acquisition departments and utilization departments to strengthen cooperation. The supply and marketing cooperatives should proactively combine with production, and reasonably distribute and supply according to the principle of rational utilization and compliance with economic accounting, and should strengthen preliminary processing, do a good job in waste product classification and grading, provide better raw materials for industry, and support national economic construction.

In order to effectively expand waste product recycling, we must correctly grasp the characteristics of waste products being scattered and decentralized. We must seize the acquisition of varieties that can already be utilized, and pay attention to the discovery, research, trial use and recycling of new varieties. At present, the comparison between the recycling volume and the utilization capacity and resource situation of many varieties is that it is entirely possible to acquire more. For example, the wadding used by the masses for making cotton clothes and bedding will always be replaced with new ones, resulting in waste cotton, although the living standards of people in different places are different. Last year, nine provinces including Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu acquired 15,905 tons, which was used for recycled cotton, equivalent to the output of more than 700,000 mu of cotton fields, which is not a small effect, but the acquisition volume accounts for a very small proportion of the actual potential waste cotton. Most counties and cities have not acquired it, while five special zones in Hebei Province, such as Xingtai, have dismantled more than 640,000 jin of waste cotton from the acquired broken cotton shoes. It can be asserted that with the replacement of new and old wadding, as well as the abandonment of cotton for industrial production, medical and health purposes, it is entirely possible to acquire more in accordance with the general rule that waste products are collected when available and not acquired when not available.

The main measures to expand acquisition are to improve acquisition methods, especially for scattered and decentralized waste products, we must go deep into various places and conduct acquisition on a regular basis. At present, the acquisition work in various places is not very thorough and universal. Therefore, on the one hand, we must go deep into urban and rural residents, adapt to the characteristics of residents requiring frequent visits, and further organize and give full play to the strength of more than 200,000 grass-roots supply and marketing points, as well as small vendors, cooperative stores, and purchasing agents of supply and marketing cooperatives, which will surely rapidly expand the acquisition volume. On the other hand, industrial and mining enterprises are users of waste products, and at the same time they are sellers. Moreover, waste products and scraps from enterprises, institutions, and organizations are relatively concentrated. In order to meet the requirements of regular processing, the supply and marketing cooperatives should take the initiative to contact and establish fixed business relationships, so as to better serve industrial production from both the acquisition of waste products and the supply of waste materials. In addition, the acquisition of waste products should also pay attention to the season. For example, during the current nationwide elimination of the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, the upcoming Spring Festival cleaning, and the transfer of cadres to lower levels in various places, there are many waste products requiring disposal in various aspects, and the supply and marketing cooperatives should seize the opportunity to conduct acquisitions and continuously improve the quality of service.

    更多更好地回收和利用废弃物资
    荆庄
    收购与利用废弃物资，是我国历来就有的良好传统，也是贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭持家方针的一项具体措施。建国以来，随着国民经济的恢复与发展，和人民生活水平的逐步提高，工矿企业和民间的废品废料逐渐增多；同时，需要废弃物资的部门也在增加，有些大工业如金属制造，橡胶，造纸和骨肥工厂等利用废弃物料，已成为生产原料的重要来源之一；在手工业中，原来就有很大一部分是以废旧物料作原料的，合作化以后，生产力提高了，对于废品废料的需要也随着增加。此外，有些废品及其制成品也是出口物资，或是社会服务业经营的对象。
    在党和政府的正确领导和群众的拥护支持下，过去几年在全国范围有组织地开展了废弃物资的回收与利用，据统计，供销合作社收购的品种，从1952年开始时的三、五种，到目前增加为五、六百种，其中80％以上是工业原料；收购数量在第一个五年计划期间共达四百二十六万多吨，1957年增长为1953年的六倍。
    把本来废弃的东西收集和利用起来，这件事具有重大的政治意义和经济意义。从以下一些例子，可以得到充分的说明：
    几年收购的废铜，相当开采冶炼六十一万多个火车厢的矿石。五年收购废钢铁一百六十五万多吨，若回炉炼钢，相当1952年全年的钢产量。造纸工业在1954—1957年四年当中利用破布绳头、渔网、破鞋、废纸等废纤维三十九万多吨，节省了可供修筑四条半宝成铁路所需的木料，造纸成本也因此降低很多。国营山东造纸总厂把卷烟纸原料由60％的线麻改为废渔网、废绳头各30％，并进行一系列技术组织的改进后，五年来不仅相对地增加产量一千八百余吨，烟纸单位成本还由二千六百余元，降低到一千四百余元。
    回收利用废弃物资，对于增加人民收入也是显著的，单是从1955—1957年通过收购废品，就直接增加人民收入九亿五千零七十多万元。浙江省遂安县游阪农业社，一百六十二户一次出售废品七百五十五元，平均每户增加收入四元六角六分。
    在收购废品的工作中，广大群众给予了很大的支持。天津废品经营处在群众支持和有关单位的协助下，两年来从旧社会遗弃埋在地下的铜土中，挖掘回收杂铜三百四十八吨；北京市一个合作社一年即从各单位的残羹剩菜、油底子、地沟泥中熬炼出工业用油三十二万斤，相当二百万斤大豆的出油量。不少地区供销社还注意了从废品中挑选零件装配成物，1956年仅上海、哈尔滨、青岛、重庆等地，即以破车、废件装配成三十七部汽车，投入了运输战线。
    过去几年废品回收与利用范围的扩大，是与工业、商业及其他有关方面的密切协作、相互支持分不开的。但是应该承认，目前仍有很多可能利用的废品还没有充分地回收利用起来。有些废品资源很多，但由于某些技术措施、成本核算等问题在工业或是商业部门中尚未解决，影响了废品的回收与利用。更主要的是，有些单位由于存在“但有新料，不用废料”以及嫌麻烦的保守思想，也影响了废品的回收与利用。如废玻璃、废电池、废毡片、废塑料等能够利用得很多，但实际回收利用得很少，就是这种原因。
    为了使收购与生产密切结合，以便更多更好地回收和利用废弃物资，必须加强领导，特别是正当工业、商业体制改革的情况下，有些部管企业交归地方领导，但不少废品废料是分散采购、集中在少数地区利用，必须更加注意收购供应与生产利用的衔接平衡。因此，应在充分发挥地方积极性的基础上，注意组织收购部门与利用部门加强协作。供销合作社应该主动地与生产结合，并按照合理利用、符合经济核算的原则，合理的进行分配供应，并应加强初步加工，搞好废品分类分级，为工业提供更好用的原料，支持国家经济建设。
    为了切实扩大废品回收，必须正确的掌握废品零星分散的特点，要抓紧已能利用品种的收购，并注意新品种的发掘、研究试用和回收。目前，许多品种的回收数量与利用能力资源情况对比，完全能够多收购一些。例如：群众作棉衣被褥等所用的絮棉，虽然各地人民生活水平不同，但总要以新换旧，从而产生废棉，去年河北、山东、河南、江苏等九省收购一万五千九百零五吨，经回弹再生棉加以利用，相当七十多万亩棉田的产量，其作用不算不大，可是收购量占实际潜存废棉的比重还很小，大部县市还没有收购，而河北省邢台等五个专区从收购的破棉鞋中即拆出废棉六十四万多斤。可以肯定，随着絮棉的新旧替换以及工业生产医药卫生用棉的废弃，按照废品收集则有，不收购则无的一般规律，多收购些是完全可能的。
    扩大收购的主要措施是改进收购方法，特别是对零星分散的废弃物品，必须深入各地经常地进行收购。目前各地的收购工作还不是十分深入和普遍的，因此，一方面要深入城乡居民中去，适应居民要求勤来勤往的特点，进一步把供销社二十多万个基层供销点，以及小商贩、合作商店、代购员等的力量都充分的组织发挥起来，这就一定能够迅速扩大收购量。另一方面，工矿企业是废品的利用者，同时又是出售者，并且企业、机关、团体等的废品废料比较集中，适应定期处理的要求，供销社应主动地进行联系，固定业务关系，以便从收购废品又供应废料两个方面更好地为工业生产服务。此外，收购废品也应该注意时令，如目前全国除四害、讲卫生和春节将至的大扫除，以及各地下放干部调转等活动中，各方面均有很多废品要求处理，供销社就应该抓紧时机进行收购，不断地提高服务质量。
