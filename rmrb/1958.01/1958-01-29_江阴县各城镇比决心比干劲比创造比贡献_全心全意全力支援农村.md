　　Xinhua Daily News: All towns in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, are launching a revolutionary competition to fully support the countryside. Their slogan is: "Wholehearted, complete, and full support to realize the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule; with one heart and one mind, work together, work hard and practically, to achieve a grain yield of 800 catties per mu." This competition was initiated at the county's town work conference held earlier this month, attended by 213 town work cadres.

　　Jiangyin County had proposed a plan before the new year to reach an average grain yield of 800 catties per mu throughout the county this year. However, various town works did not immediately keep up, and many town cadres still had varying degrees of "not my business" thinking and right-leaning conservative ideas. In response to this situation, the Jiangyin County Committee of the Communist Party of China specially convened a town work conference. Through study and debate, and by analyzing the impact of agricultural abundance and shortage on the entire national economy in the past few years, the cadres at the meeting realized the relationship between agricultural development and all town works, and clarified that facing the countryside and fully supporting agricultural production is the long-term policy of town work in the future. At the same time, the conference also forcefully criticized right-leaning conservative thinking and departmentalism. In the past, some departments in the towns had shown serious departmentalism in supporting agricultural production, shirking responsibility when things happened. The conference seriously criticized the grain system's negative attitude in planning work and the coal construction company's lack of enthusiasm in organizing miscellaneous wood and small kiln coal, educating all the cadres attending the meeting.

　　After these debates and criticisms, the conference saw a heated scene of comparing determination, drive, creativity, and contribution. Everyone used advanced thinking and advanced indicators to compare themselves, conduct self-criticism, and a heated revolutionary competition was launched between regions and departments.

　　The town work plan for the first quarter set at the meeting greatly exceeded the original annual plan. The meeting decided to do a good job in supplying building materials and farm tools needed for the current water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaign, and to meet the needs of the countryside as much as possible. The commercial department decided to immediately purchase 6,100 tons of small kiln coal and 5,000 cubic meters of miscellaneous wood from outside to support rural sideline and handicraft production. In order to support farmers in raising pigs, the industrial department decided to process more than 14.4 million catties of feed for farmers in the first quarter (an increase of 85.26% over the same period last year), and to supply another 17.58 million catties of feed. The commercial and handicraft departments also decided to mobilize and organize 609 peddlers and 68 handicraft "red stoves" to go to the countryside in the same period. For larger water conservancy projects, medical teams will also be organized to provide mobile services. The meeting also put forward the task of helping the countryside accumulate fertilizer to all the people in the towns, requiring the accumulation of one million dan of fertilizer from now until the summer harvest and summer planting. It is required that every household be mobilized, everyone should take action, and immediately launch a Patriotic Health Campaign Month, combined with the Spring Festival cleaning, to send the first batch of 280,000 dan of fertilizer to the countryside.

    江阴县各城镇比决心比干劲比创造比贡献
    全心全意全力支援农村
    本报讯　新华日报消息：江苏省江阴全县各城镇正在掀起一个全力支援农村的革命竞赛，他们的口号是：“全心、全意、全力支援，提前实现农业发展纲要四十条，同心、协力、苦干、实干，达到亩产粮食八百斤。”这个竞赛是在本月上旬召开的全县城镇工作会议上掀起的，有二百十三个城镇工作干部参加了这个会议。
    江阴县在年前已提出了今年全县每亩粮食产量平均达到八百斤的规划，可是，城镇各项工作并没有马上跟得上去，许多城镇干部还存在着不同程度的“与己无关”的思想和右倾保守思想。针对这一情况，中共江阴县委特地召开了城镇工作会议，通过学习和辩论，通过分析过去几年农业丰歉给予整个国民经济的影响，使到会干部认识到发展农业与城镇一切工作的关系，明确了面向农村、全力支持农业生产是今后城镇工作的长期方针。同时，会议还有力地批判了右倾保守思想和本位主义思想。过去，城镇中有些部门在支持农业生产上曾暴露出有较严重的本位主义，遇事互相推诿。会议严肃地批判了粮食系统在规划工作上的消极态度和煤建公司不积极组织杂木和小窑煤的缺点，教育了全体到会干部。
    经过这些辩论和批判，会议出现了比决心、比干劲、比创造、比贡献的热烈场面。人人都用先进思想、先进指标来自我比照，进行自我批评，各地区、各部门之间，掀起了热烈的革命竞赛。
    会议订出的第一季度城镇工作计划，各项指标大大突破了原订的年度计划。会议决定做好当前兴修水利和积肥运动所需的建筑器材和农具供应工作，尽量满足农村需要。商业部门决定马上向外采购小窑煤六千一百吨、杂木五千立方公尺，以支持农村副业和手工业生产。工业部门为支援农民养猪，第一季度内代农民加工饲料一千四百多万斤（比去年同期增加85.26％）外，再另行供应饲料一千七百五十八万斤。商业和手工业部门还决定在同一时期内分别发动和组织六百零九个商贩和六十八只手工业红炉下乡。在较大的水利工程上，还要组织医疗队去流动服务。会议也向全体城镇人民提出了帮助农村积肥的任务，要求从现在起到夏收夏种前积肥一百万担。要求家家动员，人人动手，马上开展一个爱国卫生运动月，结合春节大扫除，向农村送出第一批二十八万担肥料。
