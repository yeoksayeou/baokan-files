Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 21st: Teachers at Wuhan University are vigorously strengthening tutoring for worker-peasant students. Every day, they devote most of their time to helping worker-peasant students with learning difficulties by answering various difficult questions. Long Xianling, Deputy Director of the Physics Department, has been frequently going to student dormitories since last week to tirelessly answer questions for worker-peasant students. Chen Chuanlie, a worker-peasant student in the History Department, found it difficult to study modern world history. Xia Cheng, the teacher lecturing on this course, has been spending an afternoon every day since the 16th giving him individual tutoring. Teachers in each department are very enthusiastic about helping worker-peasant students review their lessons, and many older professors often go to the students to provide tutoring. Each department has also added tutoring rooms to receive worker-peasant students. The teachers have unanimously proposed to strive to ensure that no worker-peasant student falls behind in the final exams. In addition, some review groups have also been established among the students of each department to help worker-peasant students with difficulties.

After Wuhan University's rectification movement entered the rectification and improvement phase, it examined the shortcomings of not conscientiously implementing the class line in teaching in the past and began to improve. The Party and League organizations of each department conducted a detailed investigation of the learning situation of worker-peasant students, focusing on the situation of worker-peasant students with more difficulties, classified them, listed names, and mobilized all teachers to divide up the work and contract to carry out tutoring work. The administrative departments of the university and departments also tried their best to reduce the social activity time of worker-peasant students, creating the necessary conditions for them to review their lessons.

Wuhan University has about 1,100 worker-peasant students. The vast majority of students are able to study diligently and work hard. However, because most of them are older and have a poor cultural foundation, they all have varying degrees of difficulty. In addition, most of them shoulder heavy social work, which further affects their studies. For a long time, the school has not paid enough attention to their learning difficulties and has not taken effective measures to solve them. Some teachers even regarded them as a burden and had feelings of annoyance and contempt towards them, which dampened the learning enthusiasm of worker-peasant students. It was not until this rectification movement that these erroneous tendencies were corrected.

### 武汉大学认真贯彻阶级路线  加强对工农学生的辅导工作

    武汉大学认真贯彻阶级路线
    加强对工农学生的辅导工作
    新华社武汉21日电　武汉大学教师们正在大力加强对工农学生的辅导工作。每天，他们抽出大部分时间帮助学习有困难的工农学生解答各种疑难问题。物理系副主任龙咸灵从上星期日起就经常到学生宿舍里，不倦地为工农学生解答问题。历史系的工农学生陈传烈在学习世界近代史时感到困难，讲授这门课程的教师夏诚从16日起，每天抽出一个下午的时间向他个别辅导。各系的教师们对帮助工农学生复习功课热情都很高，不少老年教授也常常到学生中进行辅导工作。各系还添设了接待工农学生的辅导室。教师们一致提出要努力作到不让工农学生在期终考试中掉队。另外各系的学生中也建立了一些复习小组，帮助有困难的工农学生。
    武汉大学整风运动转入整改阶段后，检查了过去在教学中没有认真贯彻阶级路线的缺点，并着手改进。各系的党、团组织对工农学生的学习情况进行了详细的调查，着重研究了困难较多的工农学生的情况，进行了分类排队，列出名单，动员全体教师分工包干进行辅导工作。院、系行政上也尽量减少了工农学生的社会活动时间，为他们复习功课创造了必要的条件。
    武汉大学约有一千一百个工农学生，绝大多数学生都能够刻苦钻研，努力学习。但由于他们大部分年龄较大，文化基础较差，都存在不同程度的困难，加上其中大多数担负着较重的社会工作，更影响了他们的学习。而长期以来，学校对他们学习上的困难注意不够，没有采取有效措施来解决，甚至有些教师还把他们当作一种负担，对他们有厌烦和轻视情绪，这就打击了工农学生的学习热情。这次整风运动，才使这些错误倾向得到纠正。
