This newspaper, Shanghai, January 22nd -- Shanghai, taking advantage of the rectification movement, has "ignited the flame of anti-waste." To date, following the Mei Lin Canned Food Factory, several factories including the Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant, Shenxin No. 9 Factory, State-owned Cotton No. 1 Factory, and Yimin Food No. 1 Factory, as well as 47 grassroots units in the commercial sector, have successively launched a new upsurge against waste.

These factories have focused on exposing waste in the industrial production process, and many facts are shocking. The Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant calculated that the waste in the past five years is equivalent to more than one and a half times the factory's existing capital. The China Textile Machinery Factory alone lost a total of 475,000 yuan in two years due to defective products, returns for repair, rust removal, and compensation. According to materials from various factories, employees criticized waste the most in the storage and use of raw materials; poor product quality, many defective products, many returns and repairs, and obsolete product styles and monotonous varieties, resulting in stockpiling; and the failure to make good use of scrap materials and the waste of tools. Many employees sharply criticized the fact that factories stockpiled raw materials due to departmentalism. For example, the Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant has stockpiled some materials for more than ten years. Recently, it needed more than ten kilograms of purple iron sheet, but purchased more than four hundred kilograms.

The commercial sector focused on exposing many shocking facts of waste in the commodity circulation process. According to preliminary calculations by thirteen companies under the four bureaus of the commercial system, various wastes amounted to a huge 10.5 million yuan in two years. These wastes are mainly caused by lack of planning in operations, blind purchasing and sales, poor commodity storage, and improper commodity allocation. For example, the Shanghai Egg Company purchased eggs in the summer of the year before last. Due to insufficient preparation, a large number of eggs deteriorated, resulting in a loss of 270,000 yuan. The Shanghai Coal Construction Company and Timber Company cannot fully utilize their warehouses and railway special lines due to poor cooperation, resulting in an annual loss of more than 380,000 yuan in recent years.

Employees in the industrial and commercial sectors also exposed serious waste in capital construction in various units. For example, in the past few years, the Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant's investment in capital construction for non-productive aspects accounted for 44.7%. The factory already had an auditorium, but spent another 100,000 yuan last year to build a new one. The Shanghai Food Company spent one million yuan to build a "duck palace" with "blue bricks, red tiles, glass windows, cement floors, and water pipes." The Dahua Instrument Factory imported all equipment, spending a lot of money to buy a surface grinder, but it was left unused for a long time.

The overall progress of the anti-waste campaign in these pioneering units in Shanghai is smooth, and the enthusiasm of the masses is high. The big-character posters, which were once deserted in many units, are now appearing in large quantities. The Shanghai Food Export Company posted more than 2,000 big-character posters in three days, exceeding the total number of big-character posters during the first and second blooming and contending periods. More than thirty employees of the processing business section of the Vegetable Company posted more than fifty big-character posters in half a day. In many factories, the anti-waste campaign has merged with the current high tide of production. Under the slogan of "catching up with the advanced and learning from the advanced," employees have also proposed slogans such as "anti-waste, tap potential." The employees of the Shanghai Tobacco Factory No. 5 exposed 280,000 yuan of waste in the factory last year in two or three days and proposed to strive to hand over one million yuan in profits this year. Some fast-moving units have combined the inspection of waste and plugging loopholes, and then revised this year's production increase and savings plan to try to make up for the losses caused by past waste.

In the anti-waste campaign of these pioneering units in Shanghai, some problems have been initially discovered and need to be paid attention to. Although the overall situation in these units is good, some cadres have three fears about anti-waste: "fear of trouble, fear of responsibility, fear of punishment," resulting in an abnormal situation in some units where "the masses are energetic, but the cadres have concerns." The reason for this situation is mainly that these cadres have an unclear understanding of the purpose and policy boundaries of anti-waste. Therefore, it is necessary to explain to them the active spirit of anti-waste, that anti-waste is mainly to prevent waste in the future, not to investigate responsibility, and to ask them to stand in front of the movement to lead the movement.

In order to concentrate the firepower of anti-waste and allow the movement to proceed normally, it is necessary to make a general division of the scope of anti-waste. From these units, the current better approach is: factories mainly expose waste in the industrial production process, commercial departments mainly expose waste in the commodity circulation process, and also expose waste in capital construction. Waste involving the lives, wages, welfare of the masses, institutions and personnel, etc. is not the focus for the time being, and will be resolved in the next step through mass debates and other methods.

In order to make the anti-waste blooming and contending thorough and deeply reformed, the leadership must be determined to burn themselves, boldly mobilize the masses; but because anti-waste is a very complicated work, it is necessary to carefully grasp the policy boundaries, protect and promote the legitimate enthusiasm of the masses, and not damage the enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, it is necessary to make various specific analyses of waste and treat them separately. For example, in order to support production or maintain production, or to take care of the cooperative relationship of neighboring areas, commercial departments purchased more goods, which should be distinguished from general stockpiling. In order to ensure supply, stabilize prices, and purchase materials from remote areas, the resulting losses should be distinguished from general losses. There are many such situations in industrial production. If the causes are not specifically analyzed and the rights and wrongs are not distinguished, it will easily cause new confusion and affect the legitimate enthusiasm of the masses.

### 上海在反浪费高潮中提出了一个值得注意的问题  对浪费必须具体分析分别对待

    上海在反浪费高潮中提出了一个值得注意的问题
    对浪费必须具体分析分别对待
    本报上海22日电　上海一部分先行的工厂和商业部门已经“乘整风运动之风，点起反浪费之火”。到目前为止，继梅林罐头食品厂之后，已有上海第二钢铁厂、申新九厂、国棉一厂、益民食品一厂等若干工厂，商业部门已有四十七个基层单位，先后掀起了反浪费新高潮。
    这些工厂里着重揭发了工业生产过程中的浪费，许多事实十分惊人。上海第二钢铁厂计算他们五年来的浪费，相当于全厂现有资金的一倍半还多。中国纺织机械厂仅在废品、退修、擦锈、赔偿等方面，二年中共损失四十七万五千元。从各厂的材料中看，职工批评浪费最多的是原材料的保存和使用；产品质量差，废品多，返工回修多，产品式样陈旧，品种单调而造成积压；下脚废料未很好利用和工具的浪费等方面。许多职工尖锐地批评了工厂由于本位主义而积压原材料的事实，如上钢二厂有些材料已积压十多年，最近要用十多公斤紫铁皮，却去采购了四百多公斤。
    商业部门着重揭发了商品流转过程中许多触目惊心的浪费事实，据商业系统四个局所属的十三个公司的初步计算，二年来各种浪费共达一千零五十万元之巨。这些浪费主要是由于经营缺乏计划，进货和销货盲目；商品保管不善；商品调拨不当等原因所造成。如上海蛋品公司前年夏季采购鸡蛋，由于准备不足，大批蛋品变质，损失二十七万元。上海煤建公司和木材公司由于仓库和铁路专线相互协作不善，不能充分利用，几年来每年都损失三十八万元以上。
    工业、商业部门的职工还揭发了各单位在基本建设中的严重浪费现象。如上钢二厂几年来基本建设投资用于非生产方面的竟占44.7％。这个厂本来已有一个礼堂，去年竟又花十万元造了个新的。上海食品公司花一百万元造了一所“青砖、红瓦、玻璃窗、水泥地，外加水汀管子”的“鸭宫”，大华仪表厂设备添置样样都要国外进口，花了很多的钱买了一台平面吸铁机，却长期搁着未用。
    上海这些先行单位的反浪费目前总的进展都很顺利，群众热情很高。许多单位中一度冷落的大字报现在又琳琅满目地大量出现。上海食品出口公司三天内就贴出了二千多张大字报，超过了第一、二次鸣放时大字报的总和。蔬菜公司加工业务科的三十多个职工，半天内就贴了五十多张大字报。在不少工厂中，反浪费和当前的生产高潮的激流汇合了起来。职工们在“赶先进、学先进”的口号下，又补充提出了“反浪费，挖潜力”等口号。上海烟草五厂职工在二、三天内就揭发了去年本厂的浪费二十八万元，并提出要在今年争取上缴利润一百万元。一些走得快的单位已结合检查浪费，杜绝漏洞，进而修订今年的增产节约计划，设法弥补过去由于浪费所造成的损失。
    上海这些先行单位的反浪费
  中，目前也初步发现了一些问题，需要加以注意。这些单位虽然总的情况是好的，但也有一部分干部对反浪费存在着三怕：“怕麻烦、怕负责、怕处分”，致使有些单位出现“群众有劲头，干部有顾虑”的不正常局面。出现这种情况的原因，主要是由于这些干部对反浪费的目的和政策界限认识不清。因此，必须向他们说明反浪费的积极精神，反浪费主要是为了今后堵塞浪费，而不是追究责任，要他们站到运动前面来领导运动。
    为了使反浪费的火力能够集中，运动能够正常进行，对反浪费的范围作一个大体的划分是必要的。从这些单位来看，目前比较好的做法是：工厂主要是揭发工业生产过程中的浪费，商业部门主要是揭发商品流转过程中的浪费，同时揭发基本建设中的浪费。牵涉到群众生活和工资福利、机构人员等方面的浪费，目前暂不作为重点，留待下一步通过群众辩论等方式来解决。
    为了使反浪费的鸣放彻底，改得深透，领导上一定要有决心引火烧身，大胆放手发动群众；但由于反浪费是一件很复杂的工作，又需要认真掌握政策界限，保护和促进群众的正当积极性，而不要损害群众的积极性。因此就需要对浪费作各种具体分析，分别对待。如商业部门为了支持生产或维持生产，为了照顾邻区的协作关系而多进了商品，就要与一般的积压相区别。为了保障供应，稳定物价，向遥远地区采购物资而造成的亏损，就要与一般亏损相区别。工业生产方面这类情况也很多，如果不具体分析原因，分清是非，就很易造成新的混乱现象，影响了群众的正当积极性。
