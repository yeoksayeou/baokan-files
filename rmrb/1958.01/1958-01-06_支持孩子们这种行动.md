    Support the Children's Actions

    One Sunday morning, a biting wind blew in gusts. Walking down the street, my face and ears were red and white from the wind. As I approached the Tanggu People's Cinema, I saw some elementary school students, both boys and girls, wearing bright red scarves. They were holding megaphones with their hands, which were red with cold, and constantly shouting to passersby: "Please do not spit on the ground. If you have phlegm, please spit it into a spittoon, paper, or handkerchief. Because spitting on the ground will..." After shouting, some of the students would tuck the megaphone under their arm and nervously rub their red ears and cheeks with their hands; at the same time, their feet would constantly alternate, stomping on the ground. Then, they would pick up the megaphone again and continue shouting to the people. ...

    At that moment, two people were walking beside me. One of them said, "These kids are even doing propaganda! I'm not listening to their stuff. If I have phlegm, where am I supposed to spit it? Am I supposed to eat it?" After saying this, he forcefully spat out a mouthful of phlegm. I looked with disgust and indignation at the phlegm on the ground and the person who spat it as he walked away.

    The students braved the severe cold and used their holiday time to do this kind of work that benefits society. This is touching. Everyone should support their actions. Doing so is beneficial to oneself, to others, and to society. However, some people (like the comrade mentioned above) do not respect the students' valuable actions. Although they are children, what they are saying is a great truth that benefits society. What reason do we have not to listen to them? Therefore, I regret not criticizing the person who spat then and there.

    支持孩子们这种行动
    天津新港船舶修造厂轮机车间  李振远
    星期日的早晨，寒风一阵阵地吹着。走在路上，被风吹打的脸和耳朵红一块白一块的。当我走到塘沽人民电影院附近时，看见了一些佩带着鲜红的红领巾的男女小学生，他们用冻得通红的双手举着喊话筒在不断地向过路的人们喊着：“请大家不要随地吐痰。有痰请吐在痰盂或纸里或手帕上。因为随地吐痰会……”有的小学生喊完了后，把喊话筒往腋下一夹，就用双手紧张地搓搓通红的耳朵和面颊；与此同时，两只脚也不停地替换着在地上跺着。接着，就又拿起了喊话筒继续向人们喊着。……
    这时，在我的身旁有两个人走着，其中的一个人说道：“这些小孩子还来宣传哩！我是不听他们那一套的。有痰叫我往哪吐，难道还能让我吃下去？”话说完后，就从嘴里硬往外吐出一口痰来。我用厌恶而愤慨的眼光看看地上的痰和扬长而去的吐痰的人。
    小学生们冒着严寒，利用休假日的时间来做这种有益于社会的工作，这是令人感动的。每一个人都应当对他们的这种行动给予支持。这样做对己、对人、对社会都是有益的。然而，有些人（像上面所说的那位同志）却并不尊重小学生们的这种可贵的行动。他们虽是小孩子，讲的却是有利于社会的大道理，我们有什么理由不听呢？于是，我很后悔没有当面批评那个吐痰的人。
