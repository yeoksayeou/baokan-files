Why Add a Few Drops of Wine When Grinding Ink to Write Spring Festival Couplets?

During the Spring Festival, every household likes to paste Spring Festival couplets on their doors. Experienced people who write Spring Festival couplets know that adding a few drops of wine when grinding the ink makes the writing smooth and the characters rounder. What is the reason for this?

Originally, the difference between the paper used for writing Spring Festival couplets and ordinary paper is that the surface of the paper is coated with red pigment. These pigments are often composed of organic compound molecules, and the overall charge of these molecules is neutral. On the other hand, the ink we use is made by gluing carbon black together with glue. When using it, we only need to grind it with water to dissolve the glue. However, water molecules have a positive charge at one end and a negative charge at the other. There is a rule in chemistry: neutral molecules are not interested in rods with electrical charges, so pigment molecules do not get along with either end of water molecules, resulting in them not sticking together. Therefore, we need to find a molecule that has one end without an electrical charge, so that it can stick to the paper; and the other end with an electrical charge, so that it can stick to the water. This will bring the ink and pigment together. The most common of these molecules is alcohol.

Therefore, adding a few drops of wine when grinding the ink makes the written characters rounder. As for how much to add, it needs to be determined by the nature of the paper and the concentration of the ink. (Wu Min)

### 磨墨写春联时为什么要加几滴酒？

专栏：为什么？

    磨墨写春联时为什么要加几滴酒？
    过春节的时候，家家户户都喜欢在门上贴副春联。写春联有经验的人都懂得，磨墨时加入几滴酒，书写时很舒畅，字也很圆润。这是什么道理呢？
    原来，写春联的纸和一般纸不同的地方，是纸面上涂有红色颜料。这些颜料往往是有机化合物的分子组成的，而这些分子的整体是中性的；另一方面，我们用的墨，是用胶把炭黑胶在一起而成的，用时只要用水研磨把胶溶解即得。可是水分子一头带正电性，另一头带负电性。化学中有一条规律：中性分子对具有电性的棒子并不感兴趣，所以颜料分子同水分子的任何一头均合不来，结果是沾不上。这样我们就必需找一种分子，它的一头不带电性，可以沾纸；它的另一头带有电性，可以沾水，这才能把墨水和颜料拉在一起。这种分子，最普通的就是酒精。
    所以，磨墨时加几滴酒，写出来的字才圆润。至于加多少，需由纸的性质和墨的浓淡来决定。　（伍敏）
