Do you know
How big is the "Siku Quanshu"?
    During the years 1772-1790 (37-55th year of the Qianlong reign in the Qing Dynasty), China compiled a large encyclopedic series of books called the "Siku Quanshu," which included 90% of all Chinese works before the late eighteenth century.
    The "Siku Quanshu," including the original, comprised eight copies, approximately 312,000 volumes, with each book being 43 centimeters long. If it were laid out and each page connected, its length would be one-third longer than the longest diameter of the Earth (more than 4,000 kilometers). The "Siku Quanshu" was entirely copied in neat calligraphy, totaling approximately 997 million words, which is more than ten times the number of words in the contemporary French "Encyclopédie" (1751-1772) by Diderot. At that time, seven copies were made and stored in the Wen Yuan, Wen Su, Wen Jin, Wen Yuan, Wen Hui, Wen Zong, and Wen Lan Pavilions.

    你知道吗
    “四库全书”有多大？
    1772—1790（清乾隆37—55）年间，我国编纂了一部大百科全书式的丛书——“四库全书”，它把我国十八世纪后期以前所有著作的90％都收了进去。
    “四库全书”连底本共八部，约三十一万二千册，书长四十三公分。如果把它摊开来，逐页相接，那么，它的长度，将比地球直径的最长处还长出三分之一（四千多公里）。“四库全书”全部用工整的毛笔字抄成，共约九亿九千七百万字，比同时代的法国“狄德罗学典”（1751—1772）的字数多十倍多。当时抄了七份，分储在文渊、文溯、文津、文源、文汇、文宗、文澜七阁。
