    Is This Wasteful?
    Editor's Note: Judging from the letters from comrades Jin Ru, Chen Ping, and others published today, the phenomenon of one-sidedly emphasizing improving living standards while neglecting thrift is also quite common among some government cadres and workers. Especially among young cadres and young workers, the situation is even more serious, and even a bad habit of showing off and competing in extravagance has formed. Therefore, the discussion on this issue needs to be further developed and deepened.
    The editorial department now receives more than 180 letters participating in the discussion every day. This shows that everyone attaches great importance to this issue, which is good. However, in order to make the content of the submissions more focused and profound, we hereby propose the following questions for your reference when expressing your opinions:
    1. In the new society, what are the differences between advocating diligence and thrift in managing a household and the practices in the old society? What is your understanding of this issue? What valuable experiences do you have in this regard, or what erroneous thoughts and behaviors have you had?
    2. What counts as being thrifty? How are you thrifty? How do you handle the money you save through frugality?
    3. Some people say that thrift and improving living standards are contradictory. Others say that improving living standards with money earned through one's own labor is not wasteful. What is your understanding and practice of improving living standards?
    These questions cover many aspects. We hope that when writing, everyone will try to focus on one aspect or one point of the issue and express their opinions in a concentrated manner; in the analysis and criticism of the issue, try to talk more about specific facts and less about general principles. This will make it easier to discuss the issue more deeply, thoroughly, and vividly.

### 这是浪费吗？

专栏：大家讨论

    这是浪费吗？
    编者按：从今天发表的锦如、陈萍等同志的来信看，那种片面强调改善生活而忽视节俭的现象，在一部分机关干部和工人中也很普遍。特别是在青年干部和青年工人中，情况更加严重，甚至形成了讲排场、比阔气的不良风气。因此，关于这个问题的讨论，有必要进一步开展和深入。
    现在编辑部每天收到参加讨论的来信，都在一百八十件以上。这说明大家对这个问题很重视，这是好的。但是，为了使稿件的内容更加集中和深刻，我们特提出以下问题，供大家发表意见时参考：
    一、在新社会，提倡勤俭持家的意义及其作法同旧社会有什么不同？你对这个问题是怎样认识的？你在这方面有哪些值得介绍的经验，或者是曾经有过什么错误思想和行为？
    二、怎样才算节俭？你是怎样节俭的？你省吃俭用余下来的钱是怎样处理的？
    三、有人说节俭和改善生活有矛盾。也有人说，用自己劳动挣来的钱改善生活不算浪费。你对改善生活是怎样认识，怎样做的？
    这些问题涉及的方面很多。希望大家在写稿的时候，尽量抓住问题的一个方面或其中的一点，集中地发表自己的意见；对问题的分析和批判，尽量多谈具体事实，少谈一般性道理。这样，就容易把问题说得深些、透些、生动些。
