Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 11th: The East China University of Political Science and Law is carrying out a movement in its rectification campaign to eliminate old legal views, revisionism, and dogmatism from its teaching. The university first selected three courses that are most closely related to judicial practice: Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure, and the Organization of Courts and Procuratorates, focusing on checking whether the teaching content emphasizes the Party's leadership and whether it is conducive to the dictatorship of the proletariat.

After preliminary inspection, it was found that old legal views, revisionism, and dogmatism were quite serious in the teaching content of these courses. In the Criminal Law General Principles course, not only were the principled boundaries between the old and new laws not clearly delineated, but even reactionary old laws and old jurisprudence were described as science; and erroneous theories such as leniency were disseminated. For example, one-sided emphasis was placed on being lenient towards criminals and giving them good living conditions, without mentioning that only by severely suppressing the enemy and resolutely defending the interests of the people can revolutionary humanitarianism be correctly embodied. In the Criminal Procedure course, the absurd presumption of innocence and pro-defendant theories were promoted. These erroneous theories even held that any criminal, even though the case has been closed by the public security organs after investigation and the arrest has been approved by the procuratorial organs, should be presumed innocent before the court makes a judgment according to law; therefore, the court should collect materials favorable to the defendant from the perspective of the defendant's innocence, and the defense should also conduct the defense from the aspect favorable to the defendant, even if new criminal facts unfavorable to the defendant are discovered during the defense process, they should not be exposed. Regarding the course on the Organization of Courts and Procuratorates, the main problem in the teaching was the distortion of the principle of independent adjudication by the courts and the neglect of the Party's leadership over adjudication work. In the entire teaching content of these courses, the idea of implementing the Party's leadership was insufficient. What is particularly serious is that individual teachers, in their teaching, did not direct the spearhead of struggle at class enemies, but at the Party and the state's political and legal work departments, exaggerating shortcomings, obliterating achievements, distorting policies, and turning right and wrong upside down.

This inspection, under the vigorous mobilization of the school's Party organization, after relatively sufficient ideological deliberation and breaking down concerns, teachers inspected each other's lecture notes and drafts, raised questions, presented facts, and carried out free discussions and debates. Participating in the discussion were not only the teachers of this university and some senior students, but also personnel from Shanghai's judicial departments and representatives of teachers from Fudan University and Shanghai Law School. At the discussion on the presumption of innocence, Huang Dao, deputy director of the Criminal Law Teaching and Research Group, who had previously promoted this erroneous theory, first made a preliminary self-examination and self-criticism. Everyone criticized the reactionary essence of the presumption of innocence from various aspects. The vice president of the Changning District People's Court of Shanghai cited several examples in his speech to illustrate the adverse consequences caused by the presumption of innocence in the judicial department, pointing out that the criticism of this fallacy is very necessary.

In the various teaching and research groups of the East China University of Political Science and Law, the work of reforming teaching content and strengthening the ideological and combative nature of teaching is gradually deepening. The three presidents and vice presidents of the university have gone to each teaching and research group to provide specific guidance. In addition to assisting teachers in improving teaching quality, they are also preparing to study a professional course and strive to teach it themselves within one to three years. The Teaching and Research Group on the Theory of State and Law first adopted the teaching method of large classes and group discussions in the liberated areas, and according to the principle of combining Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese revolution, divided the entire course content into eight special topics, grasped the core content of Marxist-Leninist theory on state and law, combined it with the vague thoughts existing in students, and spoke deeply and thoroughly in a targeted manner, while systematically and emphatically criticizing various right-wing fallacies and revisionist viewpoints. In order to implement the principle of linking theory with practice, courses such as Land Law and Cooperative Law, and Labor Law have invited responsible persons from the Agricultural Bureau, Labor Bureau, trade unions, and agricultural cooperative directors to participate in the lectures. Wei Wenbo, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, also gave a report to all teachers and students on four questions: whether the judicial reform has worsened things, the class nature of legal science, the attitude towards the old laws, and the prospects of political and legal work. For courses that had serious errors and deviations in the interpretation of Marxist-Leninist theory, Party policies, and state laws in the past, the University of Political Science and Law has decided to arrange time to give students supplementary lessons to correct the adverse effects.

    华东政法学院检查教学内容
    大力肃清旧法观点、修正主义和教条主义
    新华社上海11日电　华东政法学院在整改中展开了肃清教学中的旧法观点、修正主义和教条主义的运动。学院首先选择同司法实践关系最密切的刑法、刑事诉讼、法院和检察院组织等三门课程，着重检查教学内容是否强调党的领导，是否有利于无产阶级专政。
    经过初步检查，发现在这些课程的教学内容中，旧法观点、修正主义和教条主义是相当严重的。在刑法总论一课中，不但没有划清新旧法律的原则界限，甚至把反动的旧法和旧法学当作科学加以辟述；并且传播了轻刑主义等错误理论。如片面强调对犯人要宽大，给犯人的生活待遇要好，而完全没有提到只有严肃镇压敌人，坚决保卫人民利益，才能正确地体现革命的人道主义。刑事诉讼课中，宣传了荒谬的无罪推定论和有利被告论。这些错误的理论竟认为：任何罪犯，虽然已经由公安机关侦察终结，并经检察机关批准逮捕，但在法院依法判决前，应该假定犯人是无罪的；因此，法院应从犯人的无罪方面去搜集有利于被告的材料，而辩护人也应从有利于被告的方面进行辩护，即使在辩护过程中发现了不利于被告的新的犯罪事实，也不应揭发。关于法院与检察院组织一课，讲授中的主要问题是曲解了法院独立进行审判的原则，忽视了党对审判工作的领导作用。在这几门课程的整个教学内容中，关于贯彻党的领导这一思想都是不够的。特别严重的是，个别教师在讲授中不是把斗争锋芒指向阶级敌人，而是指向党和国家的政法工作部门，夸大缺点，抹煞成绩，曲解政策，颠倒是非。
    这次检查在学校党组织大力发动下，经过比较充分的思想酝酿和打破顾虑以后，教师们相互检查讲义、讲稿，提问题，摆事实，开展了自由讨论和辩论。参加讨论的不仅有这个学院的教师和一部分高年级学生，还有上海司法部门的工作人员和复旦大学、上海法律学校的教师代表。在无罪推定论的讨论会上，曾经宣传过这一错误理论的刑法教研组副主任黄道首先作了初步检查和自我批判。大家从各方面批判了无罪推定论的反动本质。上海市长宁区人民法院副院长的发言中举出若干例子，说明无罪推定论在司法部门造成的不良后果，指出对这种谬论的批判是十分必要的。
    在华东政法学院的各个教研组中，改革教学内容、加强教学思想性和战斗性的工作正在逐步深入地展开。学院的三个正副院长已经到各教研组进行具体指导。他们除协助教师们提高教学质量外，还分别准备钻研一门专业课，争取在一年到三年内自己开课讲授。国家与法的理论教研组首先采取了解放区的上大课和小组讨论的教学方法，按照马列主义和中国革命相结合的原则，将全部课程内容分为八个专题，抓住马列主义关于国家与法的理论的中心内容，结合学生存在的模糊思想，有的放矢地讲深讲透，同时对有关的各种右派谬论和修正主义观点有计划有重点地加以批判。为了贯彻理论联系实际的原则，土地法和合作法、劳动法等课已邀请了农业局、劳动局、工会负责人、农业社主任等人参加讲课。中共上海市委书记处书记魏文伯也向全校师生作了关于司法改革是否改坏了、法律科学的阶级性、对旧法的态度、政法工作的前途等四个问题的报告。对于过去在马列主义理论、党的政策和国家法令的解释上有严重错误和偏差的课程，政法学院已决定安排时间为学生补课，纠正不良影响。
