Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, January 17th: Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, mobilized the masses to comprehensively inspect the progress of spring ploughing preparations, correcting any shortcomings immediately.

Starting in mid-December of last year, Yuzhong County shifted to winter production labor centered on spring ploughing preparations. The Yuzhong County Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) proposed that all spring ploughing preparations in the county must be completed before the Spring Festival. Recently, all townships and communes mobilized the masses to conduct an inspection of spring ploughing preparations, which promoted this work. Township party branch secretaries personally organized inspection teams, mainly composed of agricultural cooperative supervisory committee members, to go deep into communes, teams, households, and fields. They conducted a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the quantity, quality, and transportation of fertilizer, the repair and addition of farm tools, the storage and seed mixing of seeds, as well as livestock protection, winter irrigation, and land preparation and moisture conservation.

During the inspection, all areas adopted a method of identifying and resolving problems simultaneously. In the inspection of fertilizer accumulation and delivery in Gao'ya, Longshan, and Guodianzi townships, it was found that although the amount of fertilizer accumulated had reached the planned target when calculated for a commune as a whole, it was very uneven among the teams within the commune. Some townships reached the requirement when averaged, but there was also an imbalance between communes. In some mountainous areas, a considerable number of commune members had pigs but no pens. Some commune members in mountainous areas collected manure on the mountains but piled it at the foot of the mountains, and then had to transport it back up the mountains during spring ploughing. After discovering these problems, various regions immediately sought ways to remedy them. Communes with less fertilizer organized the masses to open up fertilizer sources, putting forward the slogan "Never go out empty-handed, everyone carries a load." Gao'ya Township, with its mountains and deep gullies, adopted the method of taking sheep flocks to the mountains, establishing thirty mountain fertilizer accumulation stations, solving the difficulty of transporting manure up the high mountains. For commune members unable to build toilets and pigsties, the masses were mobilized for mutual assistance. In addition, a method of delivering fertilizer "first to summer fields, then to autumn fields; first to mountains, then to plains; first to distant areas, then to nearby areas; first to the shady side of the mountain, then to the sunny side of the mountain" was proposed. When checking the preparation of seeds, all areas universally inventoried from commune to team, based on the planting area and the required amount of seeds. Some townships and communes found that the phenomenon of potato rot was relatively common, so they timely organized commune members to empty and divide cellars. While checking winter livestock protection, various townships also organized livestock appraisal meetings to exchange experiences in winter livestock protection, and selected and rewarded model breeders. After inspection, the Laizi Fort Township Agricultural Cooperative also implemented separate feeding for draught animals to be used in spring ploughing to facilitate adding grass and feed. Some townships found that some agricultural cooperatives only wanted to add more new farm tools and did not pay enough attention to the repair of existing farm tools, and this bias was promptly corrected. In addition, some agricultural cooperatives really needed more new farm tools and basic construction materials this year, and the time was pressing. In addition to organizing agricultural cooperatives to solve the problem themselves, the county supply and marketing cooperative also adopted a method of organizing sources of goods and supplying them at the same time, actively meeting the spring ploughing needs of agricultural cooperatives.

Yuzhong is a county in Dingxi Prefecture, the driest in Gansu Province. The county plans to sow 1,082,000 mu of grain this year, an increase of 35,000 mu over last year, with a total of 248,661 mu of irrigated land, an increase of more than 116,000 mu over last year. The planned grain yield per mu this year is 198 jin, an increase of nearly 30% over last year. Based on the spring ploughing preparations, the fertilized area of arable land this year can reach 100% from 70% last year, and the amount of fertilizer applied will increase by 30% to 35% compared with last year.

This newspaper reports that the members of the Pinging County Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) went to eleven key points throughout the county on December 23rd, and held meetings of township and commune cadres to make specific arrangements for completing basic farmland water conservancy construction and preparing for spring ploughing in advance.

The county committee required all areas to vigorously complete the ongoing profitable projects such as river dams and terraced fields in the basic construction of water conservancy and soil and water conservation, and to ensure the quality of the projects to strive for completion before the Spring Festival. In terms of preparations for spring ploughing, the county committee emphasized that "the county will use 60 dan of fertilizer per mu this year, but only one-third of the fertilizer has been accumulated. Therefore, all communes must immediately transfer a part of the labor force to fully develop fertilizer sources, launch a surprise accumulation of fertilizer, build large manure pits and pools, eliminate the phenomenon of pigs eating, chickens digging, and wind blowing fertilizer, and add soil and sprinkle water to mix fertilizer to improve fertilizer quality. After dry land is converted into paddy fields, the land leveling, edging, and ridge changing projects must be carried out intensively in order to set off a "Welcoming Spring" production upsurge before the Spring Festival.

### 大寒快过，转眼立春，及早安排，勿误时机  榆中平定全面检查春耕准备工作

    大寒快过，转眼立春，及早安排，勿误时机
    榆中平定全面检查春耕准备工作
    新华社兰州17日电　甘肃省榆中县发动群众全面检查春耕准备工作情况，发现缺点马上纠正。
    从去年12月中旬开始，榆中县就转入以春耕准备工作为中心的冬季生产劳动，中共榆中县委并提出在春节以前，全县的春耕准备工作必须完成。最近各乡、社都发动群众对春耕准备工作进行了一次检查，促进了这一工作。各乡党支部书记都亲自动手，组织了以农业社监察委员为主的检查小组，深入到社、队、户和田间，对肥料的数量、质量和运送情况，农具的补修和添置情况，种籽的保管和拌种情况，以及保畜、冬灌和整地保墒等情况，都进行了全面深入的检查。
    各地在检查中，采取一边发现问题，一边解决问题的办法。高崖、隆山、过店子等乡在检查积肥、送粪的情况中，发现积肥的数量，从一个社计算虽已达到计划指标，但在社内各个队之间却很不平衡。有的乡平均计算虽达到了要求，但社与社之间也不平衡；有些山区有相当多的社员有猪无圈；有些山区的社员到山上拾粪，却把粪堆在山下边，春耕时又要往山上送粪。各地发现这些问题后，即设法加以补救。对积肥少的社组织群众开辟肥源，提出“出门不走空，人人背背斗”的行动口号。山大沟深的高崖乡采取羊群上山办法，在高山上建立了三十个山地积肥站，解决了高山送不上粪的困难。对无力修厕所、猪圈的社员发动群众互助。另外还提出了“先夏田后秋田，先山后川，先远后近，先阴山后阳山”的送粪办法。各地在检查籽种准备的情况时，都根据播种面积和所需籽种数量，由社到队普遍进行盘点。有些乡、社发现洋芋霉烂的现象比较普遍，就及时组织社员倒窖、分窖。各乡在检查冬季保畜的同时，还组织牲畜评比会，交流冬季保畜经验，评选和奖励了饲养模范。来自堡乡农业社经过检查后还对要在春耕中使用的役畜实行了分槽喂养，以便加草加料。有些乡发现一些农业社光想多添新农具，而对旧有农具的修补重视不够，对这一偏向也及时作了纠正。另外有些农业社今年确实需要较多的新农具和基本建设材料，而且时间紧迫，对这一问题除组织农业社自行解决外，县供销社也采取了边组织货源，边供应的办法，积极满足农业社春耕需要。
    榆中是甘肃省最干旱的定西专区的一个县。全县今年计划粮食播种面积一百零八万二千亩，比去年扩大三万五千亩，共有水地二十四万八千六百六十一亩，比去年增加十一万六千多亩。今年计划粮食亩产一百九十八斤，比去年增长将近30％。根据春耕准备情况，今年耕地施肥面积可由去年的70％达到百分之一百，施肥量比去年提高30％到35％。
    本报讯　中共平定县委各委员，12月23日分别深入全县十一个基点，召开了乡社干部会议，对提早完成农田水利基本建设和准备春耕作了具体安排。
    县委要求各地对水利、水土保持基本建设，必须大力完成正在兴工的河坝、梯田等当年得利的工程，并确实保证工程质量，争取春节前完成。在备耕方面，县委强调指出“今年全县每亩用肥六十担，但积肥才达三分之一。因此要各社立即抽调一部分劳力，全面开展找肥源，突击积造肥料，修大茅坑粪池，消灭猪吃、鸡刨、风刮肥料现象，加土泼水拌肥提高肥质。旱地变成水田后，平正地面、加边、改畦等整地工程，必须抓紧进行。以便在春节前掀起一个“迎春”大生产高潮。
