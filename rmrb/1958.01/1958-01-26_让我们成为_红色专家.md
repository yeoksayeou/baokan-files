    Let Us Become "Red Experts"
    We are all students from peasant families. Under the Party's cultivation, we entered high school and are now about to graduate. Before embarking on a new life, we were very excited to see the article "Further Implement the Policy of Opening Universities to Workers and Peasants" published in the People's Daily. We fully support this policy.
    From this article, we deeply appreciate the Party's care for the children of workers and peasants. If it were not for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could we, these poor children, have the opportunity to study? Yet today, we are about to graduate from high school, and the Party has created even more favorable conditions for us, the children of workers and peasants, to enter universities, so that we can all become true "Red Experts" in the future. This is a happy life that the working people could not enjoy in the past. From this, we more deeply realize that our country is truly a country where the people are the masters. In this country, infinitely broad prospects are unfolding before us. And we firmly believe that we have the confidence to strive for the prosperity and strength of the motherland!
    We are the children of peasants, and we love the countryside. After graduation, if we are not admitted to school, we will happily return to the countryside and strive to realize our ideals on the agricultural front.

### 让我们成为“红色专家”

    让我们成为“红色专家”
    我们都是农民家庭出身的学生。在党的培养下，我们进入了高中学习，现在将要毕业了。在走向新生活的前夕，看到人民日报发表的“进一步贯彻高等学校向工农开门的方针”这篇文章，我们非常兴奋。我们完全拥护这个方针。
    我们从这篇文章里深切地体会到党对工农子弟的关怀。要是没有中国共产党和毛主席的领导，我们这些穷苦子弟怎能有读书的机会呢？然而在今天，我们将要高中毕业了，并且党还为我们工农子弟升入高等学校创造了更多的优越条件，让我们将来都成为真正的“红色专家”。这是过去劳动人民不可能享受到的幸福生活。从这里我们更加深切地体会到我们的国家真是人民当家作主的国家。在这个国家里，无限宽广的前途正摆在我们的面前。而我们坚决地相信自己有信心来为祖国的繁荣和富强而奋斗！
    我们是农民的子弟，我们热爱农村。毕业后，如果没有考入学校，我们将愉快地回到农村，争取在农业战线上实现我们的理想。
