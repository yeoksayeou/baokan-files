Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 5th: Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia stated on the evening of the 4th that the Americans "only spend their money where they can gain influence."

Prince Sihanouk made these remarks at the sixth national congress of the Cambodian People's Socialist Community, in response to complaints from delegates regarding the United States’ breach of faith in "assisting" Cambodians in the dyke construction project.

The United States promised in 1955 to provide "assistance" for the construction of dykes in the lowlands of the sixth district of Phnom Penh. However, after a year of work, the United States suddenly stopped its "assistance." To continue the project, the Cambodian authorities had to borrow 25 million riels from the United States, which resulted in landowners on the construction site having to pay large sums of money. Many landowners were unable to afford this expense, and some even sold their land. This matter was raised at the People's Socialist Community congress held on the 4th, and many delegates criticized the United States' breach of faith in their speeches and demanded government assistance.

Prince Sihanouk requested that the Cambodian work team on the site allow the Americans to take away their dyke construction machinery, as the Americans wanted to send these machines to places like South Vietnam. Prince Sihanouk finally suggested stopping the dyke construction project. The congress approved his suggestion.

    西哈努克斥美国不守信用
    对柬埔寨筑堤工程突然停止援助
    据新华社金边5日电　柬埔寨西哈努克亲王在4日晚上指责美国人“只是在那些能够取得影响的地方花他们的钱”。
    西哈努克亲王是在柬埔寨人民社会同盟第六次全国代表大会的会议上，回答大会代表就美国在“援助”柬埔寨人进行筑堤工程中不讲信用而提出的申诉时说这番话的。
    美国曾经在1955年答应提供“援助”，在金边第六区的低地上修筑堤坝。但是，当这项工程进行了一年以后，美国突然停止了它的“援助”。为了继续进行这项工程，柬埔寨当局不得不从美国借款二千五百万瑞尔；这样就使工地的土地所有者要付出很大的款项。很多工地的土地所有者无力支付这笔开支，某些人甚至出卖了他们的土地。这件事在4日举行的人民社会同盟代表大会会议上被提了出来，很多大会代表在发言中指责美国的这种不守信用的行动，并且要求政府给予援助。
    西哈努克亲王要求这个工地上的柬埔寨工作队让美国人把他们的筑堤机器拿走，因为美国人要把这些机器送到南越等地方去。西哈努克亲王最后建议停止筑堤工程。代表大会通过他的建议。
