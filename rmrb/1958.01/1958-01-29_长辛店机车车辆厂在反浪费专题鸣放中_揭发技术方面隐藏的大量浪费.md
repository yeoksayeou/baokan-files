Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant, on the basis of rectification, organized a special topic airing against waste, pushing the rectification movement to a new stage.

Since the plant launched the special topic airing against waste on January 8, to date, all employees have posted two thousand big-character posters and put forward more than six thousand four hundred opinions. According to statistics of the waste facts revealed, the losses caused by waste in this plant in 1957 amounted to 4.5 million yuan, equivalent to 24% of last year's total output value.

This special topic airing directly promoted the great leap in production. Last January, this plant only repaired fifteen locomotives. By January 22 this year, it had already completed the repair of twenty locomotives. The production cycle last year was 16.8 days to complete one locomotive, and according to statistics from the first two weeks of January this year, it only took 14.6 days. This indicator has already broken through the nation's most advanced indicator of 14.8 days.

This anti-waste special topic airing was spearheaded by cadres from the various offices. Because office cadres had access to a large amount of report data, they provided a great deal of waste data. After the office cadres took the lead in posting big-character posters, the workshops and work sections universally took action. On the 20th alone, they posted more than a thousand big-character posters in one night.

In the anti-waste special topic airing, not only were a large number of weak links in production management exposed, and many conservative practices were revealed, but also many facts about rules, regulations, standards, procedures, and specifications that were divorced from reality were exposed.

A major feature of this airing is that more than 90% of the opinions relate to technical issues, and technical issues must be calculated and tested, and cannot be rashly cancelled or modified. To this end, they concentrated the technical strength of the entire plant to study the more complex technical issues, and for some that can be improved immediately, engineering and technical personnel went to the workshop to solve them immediately. For example, the foundry workshop proposed that replacing charcoal with coke or Yangquan coal could save 70,000 yuan in material costs per year. After the chief engineer conducted a trial in the workshop, it proved to be effective, and the next day, all coke and Yangquan coal were used. In addition, some jobs have been done this way for decades. This time, it was found that the waste was huge and the operation had to be improved to eliminate waste, so technical reforms had to be carried out. As a result, a technical innovation movement was placed before the more than four thousand employees of the entire plant.

### 长辛店机车车辆厂在反浪费专题鸣放中  揭发技术方面隐藏的大量浪费

    长辛店机车车辆厂在反浪费专题鸣放中
    揭发技术方面隐藏的大量浪费
    本报讯　长辛店机车车辆修理工厂在整改的基础上，组织反浪费的专题鸣放，把整风运动推向了新的阶段。
    这个厂从1月8日展开反浪费的专题鸣放以来，到目前为止，全厂职工已经贴出了两千张大字报，提出了六千四百多条意见。据揭发出来的浪费事实统计，1957年这个厂因浪费所造成的损失达四百五十万元，相当于去年生产总值的24％。
    这次专题鸣放直接推动了生产大跃进。去年1月份，这个厂只修理了十五台机车，今年1月份到22日为止，已经完成了二十台机车的修理任务。生产周期，去年是一六点八天完成一台机车，今年1月份上两旬的统计，只需要一四点六天，这个指标已经突破了全国最先进的一四点八天的指标。
    这次反浪费专题鸣放，是由科室干部带头点火的。由于科室干部掌握着大量的报表资料，提供了许许多多浪费的数据。在科室干部带头贴出大字报以后，各车间、工段就普遍地行动起来了，仅20日一个晚上，他们就贴了一千多张大字报。
    在反浪费专题鸣放中，不仅揭发了大量的生产管理方面的薄弱环节，揭发了许多因循守旧的作法，还揭发了许多规章、条例、标准、规程、规范不切实际的事实。
    这次鸣放的一个很大特点，有90％以上的意见是涉及到技术问题的，而技术问题，必须经过计算和试验，是不能贸然取消或修改的。为此，他们集中了全厂的技术力量，对有关较复杂的技术问题进行研究，而对一些马上能改进的，工程技术人员即下到车间去，立即解决。如翻砂车间提出用焦炭或阳泉煤代替木炭每年可节省七万元材料费的问题，经总工程师在车间里进行过试用以后，证明效果良好，第
  二天即全部改用焦炭和阳泉煤。另外，有些活儿，几十年就是这么干的，这次发觉浪费很大要改进操作，消灭浪费，就得进行技术改革。于是一项技术革新的运动，又摆在全厂四千多名职工的面前了。
