    Suggestions Regarding the "Young Pioneers Reservoir"
    Zhou Jiapei, Resident of Shifuma Street, Beijing
    I heard that Hebei Province is building the "Young Pioneers Reservoir," and my daughter has been busy ever since. She spent a month or two collecting orange peels, empty toothpaste tubes, empty glass bottles, and old magazines, exchanging them with a mobile waste collection group for one yuan and forty cents. She showed it to me happily and said, "Now I can donate it to the Young Pioneers Reservoir!"
    Unexpectedly, when she took it to school in the afternoon, no one would accept it. She asked the counselor, who said that there were no instructions from above and that it was a project in Hebei Province, not Beijing. The child was puzzled and brought the money back, asking me, "Why can't I donate to Hebei Province? Isn't Beijing in Hebei Province?"
    This question was difficult for me to answer. I also wonder: Can the Young Pioneers' enthusiasm for supporting national construction be restricted by administrative divisions? Perhaps Beijing will have other plans in the future, but in this regard, can we break this self-imposed limitation? I suggest that the relevant authorities consider this issue.
    From this, another suggestion arises: The Party is calling on the people of the whole country to engage in large-scale water conservancy construction. In this work, children can also contribute. Can we build a "Young Pioneers Reservoir," "Young Pioneers Sluice" (like Hebei and Jiangsu), or "Young Pioneers Canal" in each province? Do not underestimate the small amount of money that the children have worked so hard to gather. More importantly, do not ignore the children's eagerness to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland and their grand aspirations. You can imagine how much fantasy a reservoir standing in a valley will evoke in a child! And how much joy and encouragement it will give her that she has a share of her hard work in this magnificent reservoir!

### 有关“红领巾水库”的建议

    有关“红领巾水库”的建议
    北京市石驸马大街居民　周嘉珮
    听说河北省在修“红领巾水库”，我的女儿就忙起来。她花了一、两个月时间聚集了橘皮、空牙膏管、空玻璃瓶、旧杂志，向收废物的流动组换来一元四角钱，高高兴兴地给我看，并且说，这下可以捐到红领巾水库去了。
    不料，她下午交到学校去的时候，却没有人收。问辅导员，说是上面没有布置，并且说，那是河北省搞的，不是北京市搞的。孩子奇怪了，把钱又带回来，问我：“为什么河北省的我就不能捐献？北京市难道不在河北省吗？”
    这个问题我很难回答。我也奇怪：难道少先队员支援祖国建设的心情能用行政区划来限制吗？也许北京市将来会有别的计划，但是，在这方面，能不能打破这种自我限制呢？我建议有关方面考虑一下这个问题。
    从这里，也产生了另外一个建议：党正号召全国人民千军万马兴修水利，在这一项工作里，孩子们也能出一分力量。能不能在每个省都兴修一个“红领巾水库”、“红领巾水闸”（像河北和江苏那样）或者“红领巾渠”呢？不要太轻视孩子们辛辛苦苦地聚集起来的一点钱，更重要的是，不要忽略孩子们渴望参加祖国社会主义建设的热情和宏愿。你可以设想一下，孩子对于一个矗立在山谷间的水库，会引起多少幻想！而这座壮丽的水库中又有她的一分心血，这又会给予她多大的喜悦和鼓舞！
