    New York's "Fortress of Terror"
    A United Press reporter reported on the 28th that New York's famous Central Park has become a center of crime, and people call it the "Fortress of Terror," where murders, rapes, and robberies often occur.
    Kennedy, the head of the police station in the park area, said that in the three months of June, July, and August last year, 41 major criminal cases and 344 minor cases were reported to the police station.
    The United Press reporter wrote that many criminal incidents were not reported to the police station at all. For example, in the park, there is an area called "Hangout Hill," which is a gathering place for sodomy. In an area called "The Bay," unreported rapes often occur.

    纽约的“恐怖堡垒”
    合众社记者28日报道说，纽约著名的中央公园已经成了一个犯罪的中心，人们把它叫做“恐怖的堡垒”，在那里经常发生谋杀、强奸和抢劫事件。
    公园区的警察分所所长肯尼迪说，在去年6、7、8三个月中，向警察局报案的有四十一起重大犯罪案件和三百四十四起较轻的案件。
    合众社记者写道，还有许多犯罪事件根本没有报警察局。譬如说，在公园中有一个名为“逍遥岗”的地区，是一个鸡奸会合处。在一个名为“海湾”的地区，经常发生不报案的强奸事件。
