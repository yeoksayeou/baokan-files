No Longer "Strangers" to the Workshop
    ——After Cadres from Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant Go Down to the Workshops
    By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun
    Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant is one of the first enterprises in the Liaoning area to streamline its organization and send cadres down to lower levels. The streamlining of the organization in this factory has come to an end, and two hundred and twenty-four cadres (including ninety-six technicians who graduated from universities and secondary technical schools) have been sent down to the workshops to participate in labor production. People are concerned about how this group of cadres is performing in their new positions, whether they are getting along well with the master workers and workers, and whether they can adapt to the new environment.
    I visited some workshop directors, foremen, and veteran workers in this factory, and the answers I received were satisfactory.
    Respecting Masters, Enduring Hardship and Toil
    They told me that the general performance of these young intellectuals after being sent down to the workshops is that they are full of energy, willing to put aside their airs, very modest towards the master workers, and get along very well with the young workers. Wang Mingli, a foreman in the second workshop, said: When Zhou Zheng, a Russian translator from the design section, came to work as an apprentice on a large vertical lathe, I wondered if this college student could really do the work. Who knew that as soon as he arrived, he was less afraid of fatigue and dirt than anyone else, always holding a cotton yarn ball to wipe the machine, never idle all day, wiping the machine brightly and cleaning the floor very thoroughly. When the master worker was about to wash his hands after work, he rushed to fetch the water. When the master worker needed to take medicine, he would bring the hot water to him. The master worker felt that he was a college student and felt bad that he was fetching water for him to wash his hands every day, so he suggested that everyone take turns fetching water; but Zhou Zheng insisted on doing it himself. Once, he saw the master worker cleaning up a large pile of iron filings and immediately snatched the iron shovel. This incident moved the master worker very much, and he later told everyone he met: I am so lucky to have such an apprentice!
    Another person praised by the master workers is Zhang Zhong, a sand casting apprentice in the steel casting workshop, who was originally the chief accountant of the finance section and an advanced producer in the factory. When the cadres were sent down, he asked to go to the dirtiest and most tiring place. He said: Although I am a college student, I am still "illiterate" in production. Therefore, after being sent down to the steel casting workshop, he was able to learn from others with an open mind and was very proactive in work and study. As soon as the master worker finished marking the lines and was about to start the actual operation, he would prepare the hammer, spoon, and other tools. As soon as the master worker finished his work, he would clean up the site. He did not dislike the sour or smelly things at all, and he volunteered to do the most tiring tasks such as compacting sand and ramming boxes. The director and foremen of this workshop all said: This group of cadres sent down is just like us when we were apprentices one or two decades ago, able to endure hardship and toil!
    There is a technician in the steel casting workshop named Du Xinbai, who used to be particularly fond of cleanliness and had to run to the factory department to relieve himself because he thought the workshop's toilet was unsanitary. This time, he went to the electric furnace to work as an apprentice, scooping out furnace packets and pushing furnace slag, his face covered in black all day long, with dirty sweat streaming down. Not only did he not dislike the dirt, but he also worked very happily. The workers were all moved and said: "In the past, it was said that intellectuals could talk but not do, and were afraid of dirt and fatigue, but now this view should be changed."
    Workshop Atmosphere Changes, Apprentices Receive Education
    After this group of cadres participated in labor, the atmosphere in the workshops has changed greatly. The most profound impression on the master workers is that many apprentices used to be very arrogant and did not respect the master workers. Especially the apprentices who entered the factory last year, thinking they had some education, did not take the master workers seriously. At first, they would reluctantly call them "Master," but later they would call them Lao Zhang, Lao Li, and even Wang Mazi and Wu Dalang. For example, Wang Baicheng, an apprentice in the steel casting workshop, is a junior high school student. When he first came, he said he would learn from the master worker, but later it became "mutual learning," and then he simply said that the master worker was an "old illiterate" and "there was nothing to learn." When the master worker asked him to work, he went outside to sleep. Gao Xibin, an apprentice in the second workshop, thought that working on a small shaper was not promising. When the master worker asked him to work, he refused; when the master worker asked him to sweep the floor, he said he would sweep it as many times as you did, and the master worker really had no way to deal with him. However, this time, when the cadres were sent down, the apprentices saw that many of them were college students, and they came down to be apprentices like them, and they never picked and chose, sweeping the floor and fetching water, and even volunteered to do the tiring and dirty work, and were particularly modest towards the master workers. This greatly educated the original apprentices, and they all worked and studied honestly. Apprentice Wang Baicheng said: "The cadres sent down have high culture and strong technology, but they still say that they are 'illiterate' in production and respect the master workers very much. In the past, I said that the master worker was an 'old illiterate,' but now, in comparison, I am the real 'illiterate.' If I don't learn modestly, I will really ruin myself!" Apprentice Gao Xibin also took the initiative to examine his own mistakes and promised to respect the master worker and learn from the master worker in the future.
    Another significant change is that the workshop has become more civilized and hygienic. Yu Changzeng, a foreman in the second workshop, told me: Since the cadres came to the workshop, the machine equipment has become brighter and the environmental hygiene has improved. In the past, new machine tools were often not wiped for months, and even the handles were too greasy to turn. Now, because they are wiped every day, the machine tools are shiny; and because the parts are placed very neatly, the traffic lanes also look like traffic lanes. He pointed to a place and said to me: In the past, parts were scattered everywhere on this traffic lane, and it was impossible to walk. Now the parts are placed in a row, and the traffic lane looks wider, which is not only easier to walk, but also makes work much more convenient.
    Theory Links with Practice, Solving Technical Problems
    During the interviews, many workshop directors and foremen also told me that because the cadres sent down have a certain amount of cultural and technical theoretical knowledge, they have put forward some constructive opinions after contacting reality, and have worked with the master workers to study and solve some key problems in production, which has been very helpful to their work. Jiang Shuzu (formerly a technician in the education section), an apprentice in the assembly workshop, and his master, Shan Jishan, improved the fixtures for testing fifty-meter large tanks. Liu Ruofei (formerly a process engineer in the process section) improved the processing method of the graduated dial, reducing the processing time from thirty minutes to eighteen minutes and reducing the labor intensity. Director Lü of the steel casting workshop told me: Because there were no technicians following the production in the past, when technical problems occurred on the electric furnace, the cause could not be found in time, causing losses to production. This time, five technicians went to the electric furnace to work as apprentices, and technicians participated in the operation in every shift, so technical problems could be solved in a timely manner. A few days ago, a furnace of molten steel had a honeycomb phenomenon, and the technicians (apprentices) and veteran workers of the three shifts worked together to study and solve the problem.
    The comrades interviewed also mentioned that in the past, because the staff of the departments lacked practical experience, the technical documents they formulated were often divorced from reality. After these people came down, they became a bridge between the departments and reality. For example, after Liu Ruofei, a process engineer in the process section, went to the workshop, he found that the accuracy requirements in the process documents for the gas generator bell jar were too strict. The design and process departments accepted his opinion and revised the accuracy requirements, which not only reduced the heavy workload of the workers, but also reduced the processing time from twenty hours to twelve hours. Director Lü of the steel casting workshop said: "In another six months, after this group of cadres sent down have mastered the actual operating technology, they will become the backbone of promoting new technologies and rationalization proposals, which will have a great impact on the production of the workshop."

    不再是车间的“陌生人”
    ——沈阳矿山机器厂干部下放车间以后
    本报记者　金雨困
    沈阳矿山机器厂是辽宁地区紧缩机构下放干部最早的企业之一。这个厂的紧缩机构工作已告一段落，二百二十四名干部（其中大学和中等专科学校毕业的技术员九十六名），已下放到车间参加劳动生产。人们关心的是，这批干部走上新的岗位以后的表现如何？和老师傅和工人的相处是否融洽？能不能适应新的环境？
    我访问了这个厂的一些车间主任、工长和老工人，得到的回答是令人满意的。
    尊重师傅　吃苦耐劳
    他们告诉我，这些青年知识分子下放到车间以后，较普遍的表现是精神饱满，放得下架子，对老师傅非常虚心，和青年工人也相处得很融洽。二车间工长王明礼说：当设计科俄文翻译周政到大立车床当学徒时，我心想：这个大学生是否真能干活？谁知他一来，就比谁也不怕累，不嫌脏，手里老拿个棉纱球在擦机床，整天没有闲着的时候，把机床擦得光亮，把地打扫得很干净。一到下班师傅要洗手，他就抢着把水打来。师傅要吃药，他就把热开水送到面前。师傅觉得他是大学生，天天给自己打水洗手实在过意不去，就提出大家轮流打水；但是周政坚持由他打。有一次，他发现师傅在打扫一大堆铁屑，就马上把铁铲抢过来。这事，使得师傅非常感动，以后逢人就说：摊到这样的徒弟实在太幸福！
    另一个受到师傅称赞的是铸钢车间的翻砂徒工张忠，原财务科主任会计员，厂里的先进生产者。下放干部时，他要求到最脏最累的地方。他说：我虽是一个大学生，但在生产上还是一个“文盲”。因此他在下放到铸钢车间以后，能够虚心地向别人学习，在工作和学习上都很主动。师傅刚划完线，要开始实际操作，他就把榔头、勺子等工具准备停当；师傅一干完活，他就把工地清理好了。遇有酸味、臭味的东西，他一点不嫌，括砂、椿箱等最累的活，他争着干。这个车间的主任和工长都说：这批下放干部，就像我们一、二十年前当学徒时那样，能吃苦，能耐劳！
    铸钢车间有个技术员叫杜新百，过去特别爱干净，大小便都要跑到厂部去，因为他嫌车间的厕所不卫生。这次，他到电炉上去当学徒，掏炉包、推炉渣，整天脸上闹得漆黑，脏汗一道一道地流。他不但不嫌脏，而且干得还很愉快。工人们都感动地说：“过去说知识分子能讲不能干，怕脏又怕累，现在这种看法应该有所改变了。”
    车间风气改变　徒工受到教育
    这批干部下放参加劳动后，车间的风气有了很大的改变。给老师傅的印象最为深刻的是：过去许多徒工都很骄傲，不尊重老师傅。特别是去年入厂的学徒，自以为有点文化，就不把师傅放在眼里。开始时，还勉强叫声师傅，以后就叫老张、老李，再以后更是王麻子、武大郎乱叫一气。例如，铸钢车间的徒工王百成，是个初中学生。刚来时，他还说要向师傅学习，以后就变成“互相学习”，再以后更索性说师傅是“老文盲”，“没有什么可学习的”。师傅叫他干活，他到外边睡觉。二车间的徒工高希斌，认为在小插床干活没有出息。师傅叫他干活，他不干；师傅叫他扫地，他说你扫几遍，我也扫几遍，师傅对他实在没有办法。可是，这次干部下放，徒工一看许多人都是些大学生，下来也跟他们一样当个小学徒，而且从不挑肥拣瘦，扫地打水都来，累的脏的活还争着干，对师傅还特别虚心。这就使原来的徒工受了很大的教育，他们也都老老实实地干活和学习了。徒工王百成这样说：“下放干部的文化高、技术强，可是还说自己在生产上是‘文盲’，对老师傅非常尊重。过去我说师傅是‘老文盲’，这回一比较，我才是真正的‘文盲’呢？再不虚心学习，真要毁了自己！”徒工高希斌也主动检讨了自己的错误，保证今后尊重师傅，好好地向师傅学习。
    另一个显著的变化是，车间里更加文明和卫生了。二车间工长于长增告诉我：自从干部下到车间以后，机器设备都亮了起来，环境卫生也好了。过去，新机床往往几个月也不擦一遍，甚至因油腻太多而弄得摇把都摇不动。现在因为天天擦，机床都亮光光的；而且因为部件都放置得很整齐，交通道也像个交通道了。他指着一个地方对我说：过去这个交通道上，部件到处乱放，连走路都没法走。现在部件放得一溜一溜的，交通道也就显得比较宽敞，不但好走路，而且工作起来也方便得多了。
    理论联系实际  解决技术问题
    在访问中，许多车间主任和工长还对我说，由于下放干部都有一定的文化技术理论知识，在接触实际以后，已提出了一些建设性的意见，和老师傅一起研究解决了一些生产上的关键问题，对他们的工作很有帮助。装配车间徒工姜述祖（原教育科技术员）和师傅单继山一起，改进了试验五十公尺大罐的活具。徒工刘若飞（原工艺科工艺员）改进了刻度板的加工方法，加工一个由三十分钟降到十八分钟，并且减轻了劳动强度。铸钢车间吕主任对我说：由于过去没有技术人员跟班生产，电炉上发生了技术问题，不能及时找出原因，使生产受损失。这次，有五名技术员到电炉上当学徒，班班都有技术员参加操作，技术问题也就能够得到及时的解决。前几天，一炉钢水发生蜂窝现象，三个班的技术员（徒工）和老工人，就一起研究解决了这个问题。
    被访问的同志还谈到，过去，由于科室人员缺乏实际操作经验，他们制订的技术文件往往脱离实际。这些人下来以后，成了科室联系实际的桥梁。例如，工艺科工艺员刘若飞下车间后，就发现煤气发生炉钟罩的工艺文件上的精度要求过严。设计和工艺部门接受他的意见，对精度要求作了修改，不仅减轻了工人操作的繁重程度，而且使加工工时由二十小时减到十二小时。铸钢车间吕主任说：“再有半年时间，这批下放干部掌握了实际操作技术以后，就会成为推广新技术和合理化建议的骨干，将对车间的生产发生很大的作用。”
