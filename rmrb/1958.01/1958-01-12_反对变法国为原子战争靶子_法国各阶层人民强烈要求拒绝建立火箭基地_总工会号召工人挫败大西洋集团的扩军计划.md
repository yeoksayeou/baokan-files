　　Comprehensive report from this newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency reports: A movement against the establishment of American rocket bases on French territory is currently unfolding throughout France. This movement has swept across the broadest strata of the people.

　　The Montélimar City Council demanded that the French government refuse to deploy rocket installations and establish atomic and thermonuclear weapon depots on its territory.

　　The Committee of the Teachers' Union of the Vosges Department and the Committee of the National Association of Former French Resistance Fighters passed a joint resolution demanding that the French government "prohibit the deployment of rocket installations on French territory and prohibit American planes carrying atomic bombs from flying over France."

　　In Valence, a large group of intellectuals, trade unionists, and representatives of social activists wrote a letter to the head of government. The letter said: "We believe that establishing such bases in our country will further deepen the danger of turning France into a target for atomic bombs."

　　The National Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor, which met on the 7th and 8th, passed a resolution calling on all organizations affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor and all workers to condemn the government's position of making France a target in war, calling on them to strengthen united action, demand an immediate halt to American aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs flying over France, and refuse to set up rocket launch pads in France. The committee expressed its firm belief that workers will take united action to thwart the new decisions on arms expansion made at the North Atlantic Group's Paris conference. (Attached picture)

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：目前在全法国展开了反对在本国领土上建立美国火箭基地的运动。这个运动席卷了最广泛阶层的人民。
    蒙德里马市议会要求法国政府拒绝在本国领土上配置火箭装置和建立原子武器及热核武器仓库。
    孚日省教师工会委员会和前法国抵抗运动战士全国协会委员会通过了一项联合决议，要求法国政府“禁止在法国领土上配置火箭装置和禁止载有原子弹的美国飞机在法国上空飞行”。
    在瓦棱斯市，很大一批知识分子、工会和社会活动家的代表给政府首脑写了一封信。信中说：“我们认为，在我们国家建立这类基地将更加加深变法国为原子弹靶子的危险”。
    在7日和8日举行会议的法国总工会全国委员会通过决议，号召隶属总工会的一切组织和全体劳动者谴责政府要使法国在战争中成为靶子的这种立场，号召他们加强一致行动，要求立即制止带有氢弹的美国飞机在法国上空飞行和拒绝在法国设置火箭发射台。委员会表示深信：劳动者会采取团结一致的行动来挫败北大西洋集团巴黎会议所作出的关于扩充军备的新决定。（附图片）
