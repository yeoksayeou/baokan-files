Xinhua News Agency, London, January 13th: British newspapers today expressed disappointment with Eisenhower's reply to Bulganin on January 12th.

    The conservative "Daily Mail's" editorial said that Eisenhower's reply "contained no new proposals that could ignite the imagination or allow the West to regain the initiative." Eisenhower "missed a golden opportunity to seize the diplomatic initiative from the Russians."

    The liberal "News Chronicle" believed that Eisenhower's reply "appears to be approaching the problem from the wrong angle," and his proposals "still revert to the old unresolved issues."

    The "Manchester Guardian" also believed that Eisenhower's reply did not put forward any new proposals to ease the tension between East and West, and therefore did not show that the United States was seriously prepared to discuss the issue with the Soviet Union.

    The Labour Party's "Daily Herald" accused Eisenhower's reply of merely "restating all the old problems that have divided the world for years," and the newspaper suggested accepting the Soviet Union's proposal to hold high-level East-West talks.

    The "Daily Worker" pointed out that Eisenhower's reply "undermined (East-West) summit meetings."

    英报对艾森豪威尔的回信表示失望
    据新华社13日讯　伦敦消息：英国报纸今天对艾森豪威尔12日给布尔加宁的回信表示失望。
    保守党的“每日邮报”的社论说，艾森豪威尔回信中“没有可以燃烧起想像力或者为西方重新取得主动权的新建议”，艾森豪威尔“错过了一个从俄国人方面取得外交主动权的大好机会”。
    自由党的“新闻纪事报”认为，艾森豪威尔的回信“看来是从错误的方面来接触问题的”，他提出的建议“仍然回到了那些没有解决的老问题上”。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”也认为，艾森豪威尔的回信没有提出缓和东西方之间的紧张局势的新建议，因而没有表现出美国是认真地准备同苏联讨论问题的。
    工党的“每日先驱报”指责艾森豪威尔的回信只是“重申一遍所有那些使世界分裂了多年的老问题”，报纸建议接受苏联关于举行东西方高级会谈的建议。
    “工人日报”指出，艾森豪威尔的回信“破坏了（东西方）高级会议”。
