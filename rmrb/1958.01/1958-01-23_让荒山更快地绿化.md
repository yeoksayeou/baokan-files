    Let the Barren Hills Be Greened Faster
    In recent years, many agricultural cooperatives have greened large areas of barren hills at an astonishing rate. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Forestry, there are currently 1,167 cooperatives nationwide with afforestation exceeding 1,000 mu, of which 75 cooperatives have reached 10,000 mu of afforestation. This fact shows that as a result of agricultural collectivization, the afforestation endeavor has also begun a great leap forward. As long as the superiority of collectivization is brought into play, the afforestation endeavor can also develop rapidly.
    During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, China had already afforested more than 10 million hectares, exceeding the planned target by a large margin. The forests we built in five years are more than thirty times the total afforestation volume during the Kuomintang rule. This is certainly a leap. However, the ambitious people of New China should always look forward, rather than be satisfied with the achievements already made. China's original forest area is too small, and there are still many barren hills and ridges, far from the goal of greening. There is still a big contradiction between China's production of timber and other forestry products and the needs of national construction and people's lives. This requires the people of the whole country, especially the people in mountainous areas, to make greater efforts to green the barren hills and wastelands across the country faster.
    The best way to accelerate the greening of barren hills is to make full use of the superior conditions of the cooperative system and implement centralized, large-scale afforestation wherever possible. All mountainous agricultural cooperatives can, according to their own conditions, formulate plans to realize "100-mu forests," "1,000-mu forests," "5,000-mu forests," and "10,000-mu forests" in stages, as goals to inspire the afforestation enthusiasm of the broad masses of cooperative members. This kind of centralized, large-scale afforestation is easier to organize and lead than decentralized, small-scale afforestation, easier to operate and manage, and conducive to the survival of young forests. Therefore, this is also an effective method for controlling soil erosion on barren hills. After agricultural collectivization, Hebei Province issued such a call to the agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous areas of the province, which greatly promoted the afforestation cause of the province. In the past two years, 28 "10,000-mu forest cooperatives" have emerged in the province. The Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Baimahe Township, Xingtai County, was the earliest cooperative in Hebei Province to advocate the construction of "10,000-mu forests." In the spring of 1956, this cooperative mobilized 2,400 male and female laborers in the entire cooperative and completed the task of afforestation of 10,000 mu of barren hills in just seven days. Pinggu County, Hebei Province, has 800,000 mu of barren hills, accounting for 62% of the total area of the county. If the past method of small-scale, sporadic tree planting is adopted, it will be difficult to green the barren hills of the entire county by 1972. In 1956, the county led two townships to pilot the construction of "10,000-mu forests." Starting in 1957, it adopted the method of concentrating efforts, launching short-term assaults, and large-scale afforestation. In one year, seven townships in the county completed three "10,000-mu forests," and the afforestation in one year was equal to the total of the past six years. At present, among the more than 700,000 agricultural cooperatives in the country, about 300,000 are in mountainous areas (including hilly areas). If 50,000 "10,000-mu forest cooperatives," 100,000 "5,000-mu forest cooperatives," and 150,000 "1,000-mu forest cooperatives" are created in mountainous areas in the next ten years, then 1.15 billion mu of forest can be created nationwide. This means that the goal of greening barren hills stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program will likely be achieved ahead of schedule.
    Will concentrating a large amount of manpower and using a relatively short period of time to complete large-scale afforestation cause confusion? Can the quality of afforestation be guaranteed? The experience of Pinggu County and other regions proves that as long as the afforestation team is well organized, a large number of people will not cause confusion. When Pinggu County built three "10,000-mu forests" last year, it mobilized all the labor force of several townships to go up the mountain at the same time. Because the labor force was divided into brigades, teams, and groups in advance, and the responsible sections of each afforestation team were clearly divided, the result was very orderly. As for the quality of afforestation, it depends on whether there is sufficient preparation before afforestation. Before each large-scale centralized afforestation, Pinggu County spent 20 days to a month to make full preparations in all aspects (including ideological mobilization, arrangement of farm work, organization of labor force, collection and identification of tree species and seedlings, teaching of afforestation techniques, etc.). As a result, the quality was much higher than in the past when afforestation was scattered and sporadic.
    The targets of "100-mu forests," "1,000-mu forests," "5,000-mu forests," and "10,000-mu forests" can be achieved once or in one year, or several times or in several years, and there is no need to force consistency in time. However, during the afforestation season, it is necessary to take out a few days to concentrate all or most of the labor force of a township, a village, or a cooperative to carry out centralized afforestation. After afforestation, a certain amount of labor force must be used to nurture the young forests seasonally, and missing seedlings must be replanted immediately. The afforestation season is often also a season of intense farm work, and conflicts may occur in the use of labor force between agriculture and forestry. However, the experience of various places has also proved that this contradiction can be completely overcome. The experience of Pinggu County in "preparing for a long time, arranging for a short time, and concentrating efforts on afforestation" includes methods to solve this contradiction. The key is to make proper arrangements for various farm work and afforestation "in advance and postponed" according to the principle of overall planning and consideration.
    To complete large-scale afforestation in the shortest possible time, but also to ensure the quality of afforestation and improve the survival rate; to organize a large number of labor force to concentrate on afforestation, but also not to delay agricultural production, this is more, faster, better and more economical in the afforestation endeavor. To achieve this goal, there must be one most fundamental condition, that is, the party committees at all levels must vigorously grasp forestry production. In the past, the leading organs in some areas actually regarded forestry as a sideline, rarely cared about it, and rarely gave specific leadership, only letting forestry department staff work there alone. This is an important reason why the situation could not be opened up. The Pinggu County Party Committee directly grasped the work of greening barren hills, and the county party secretary and county head took the lead in going up the mountain for afforestation. As a result, the afforestation endeavor in the entire county was vigorously launched. Many "1,000-mu forests," "5,000-mu forests," "10,000-mu forests," and bank protection forests along the 113-li-long沟河 were quickly born.
    Forestry production is a cause for the whole people, so in carrying out a large-scale afforestation movement, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses (including youth, women, and children) to participate. The experience of the past few years proves that youth is the shock force of the afforestation movement. The "1,000-mu forests," "5,000-mu forests," and "10,000-mu forests" that have emerged have all been built successfully under the initiative or active participation of young people. Therefore, in the process of mobilizing afforestation, it is first necessary to mobilize and organize the broad masses of young people through the Communist Youth League organizations, and rely on them to drive the entire masses. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation, various agricultural cooperatives should also pay attention to solving the problem of labor remuneration for afforestation.
    Now spring afforestation has begun in some areas in the south, and will soon begin in the north. The revolutionary spirit in agricultural production has already been boosted. Now it is also necessary to boost the revolutionary spirit in forestry production and make a great leap forward in the cause of greening barren hills!

### 让荒山更快地绿化

    让荒山更快地绿化
    近几年来，有许多农业合作社以惊人的速度绿化了大面积的荒山。据林业部不完全的资料统计，目前造林达到一千亩以上的社，全国已有一千一百六十七个，其中七十五个社造林达到了一万亩。这个事实说明：农业生产合作化的结果，造林事业也开始了大跃进。只要发挥了合作化的优越性，造林事业就也能够飞速发展。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我国已经造林一千多万公顷，超过计划指标很多。我们在五年中所营造的森林，比国民党统治时期全部造林数量还多三十多倍。这当然是个飞跃。但是，有志气的新中国人民应当永远向前看，而不应当满足于已有的成绩。我国原有的森林面积太小，荒山秃岭至今仍然很多，距离绿化的目标仍然很远。我国木材和其他林业产品的生产同国家建设和人民生活需要之间还有很大的矛盾。这就要求全国人民，首先是山区人民作更大的努力，更快地绿化全国的荒山荒地。
    加速绿化荒山的最好的办法，就是充分运用合作制度的优越条件，在一切可能的地方，实行集中的成片造林。所有的山区农业合作社，都可以根据自己的条件，订出分期实现“百亩林”、“千亩林”、“五千亩林”、“万亩林”的计划，作为奋斗目标，用以鼓舞广大社员的造林积极性。这样集中的成片造林比分散的小面积造林便于组织领导，便于经营管理，有利于幼林的成活。因此，这也是治理荒山水土流失的有效方法。河北省在农业合作化以后，向全省山区农业社发出了这样的号召，对全省的造林事业起了很大的推动作用。两年来这个省已经出现了二十八个“万亩林社”。邢台县白马河乡灯塔农业合作社是河北省最早倡议营造“万亩林”的社。1956年春季，这个社把全社二千四百名男女劳动力发动起来，仅仅用了七天时间，就完成了万亩荒山造林的任务。河北省平谷县有荒山八十万亩，占全县总面积62％。如果采取过去那种小面积零星植树的办法，到1972年也难把全县荒山绿化。这个县在1956年领导两个乡进行了营造“万亩林”的试点，从1957年开始采取了集中力量、短期突击、大面积造林的方法，全县一年就有七个乡完成了三个“万亩林”，一年造林等于过去六年的总和。现在全国的七十多万个农业合作社中，山区（包括丘陵区）社约有三十万个。如果今后十年内山区创造出五万个“万亩林社”、十万个“五千亩林社”、十五万个“千亩林社”，那么全国就可以造林十一亿五千万亩。这就是说，全国农业发展纲要所规定的绿化荒山的目标将有可能提前实现。
    把大量人力集中起来，用一个比较短的时间来突击完成大面积造林，不会发生混乱现象吗？造林质量能有保证吗？平谷县和其他地区的经验证明，只要把造林队伍组织好，人多也不会混乱的。平谷县去年营造三个“万亩林”的时候，动员了几个乡的全部劳动力同时上山，由于事先都把劳动力编成大队、小队、小组，把各个造林队伍的负责地段都作了明确划分，结果秩序很好。至于造林质量的好坏，则是决定于造林前是否有充分的准备。平谷县在每次进行大面积集中造林之前，都拿出二十天到一个月的时间从各方面进行充分的准备（包括思想动员、农活的安排、劳动力的组织、树种树苗的筹集与鉴定、造林技术的传授等等），结果质量比过去分散零星造林高得多。
    “百亩林”、“千亩林”、“五千亩林”、“万亩林”这些指标，可以一次或一年实现，也可以几次或几年实现，时间上不必强求一致。但是，在造林季节里必须拿出若干天的时间，集中一个乡、一个村或一个社的全部或大部劳动力，实行集中造林。造林之后，必须按季节用一定的劳动力去抚育幼林，发现缺株死苗的立即补植。造林季节常常也是农活紧张的季节，农林之间在劳动力的使用上可能发生矛盾。但是，各地的经验也证明：这个矛盾是完全可以克服的。平谷县的“长准备，短安排，集中力量造林”的经验中，就包含了解决这个矛盾的方法。关键是根据统筹兼顾的原则，对各项农活和造林加以“提前错后”的妥善安排。
    既要在最短时期内完成大面积造林，又要保证造林质量，提高成活率；既要组织大量劳动力集中造林，又要不误农业生产，这就是造林事业上的多快好省。要达到这个目的，必须具备一个最根本的条件，就是各级党委要把林业生产大力抓起来。过去有些地区领导机关实际上把林业只当做副业，对它很少关心，很少给予具体领导，只让林业部门工作人员在那里孤军奋战。这是局面打不开的重要原因。平谷县委直接把荒山绿化工作抓了起来，县委书记、县长带头上山造林，结果全县的造林事业就蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来了。许多“千亩林”、“五千亩林”、“万亩林”以及长达一百一十三里的沟河两岸的护岸林，都很快地诞生了。
    林业生产是全民的事业，因此在开展大片造林运动中，必须发动广大群众（包括青年、妇女、儿童）参加。几年来的经验证明：青年是造林运动的突击力量，已经出现的“千亩林”、“五千亩林”、“万亩林”，都是在青年们的首倡下或积极参加下营造成功的。因此，在发动造林的过程中，首先要通过青年团组织把广大青年发动起来，组织起来，并且依靠他们去带动全体群众。为了鼓舞群众造林的积极性，各个农业合作社还要注意解决造林的劳动报酬问题。
    现在春季造林在南方一些地区已经开始，北方不久也将开始。农业生产上的革命干劲已经鼓起来了，现在还要在林业生产方面鼓起革命干劲，使荒山绿化事业也来一个大跃进！
