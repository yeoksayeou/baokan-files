    Henan Province's Rural Rectification First Focuses on Weak Links
    Using the Class Line to Rectify Third-Category Cooperatives
    Over Two Thousand Three Hundred Third-Category Cooperatives Leap to First and Second-Category Cooperatives
    (Our newspaper reports) In the vast rural areas of Henan, after the unfolding of the socialist education movement with great airing of views, great debates, and great improvements, according to statistics from sixty-three counties, more than two thousand three hundred third-category cooperatives (approximately 65% of the original number of third-category cooperatives) have changed their backward appearance and have leaped to the level of first or second-category cooperatives. Currently, the situation in these cooperatives is as follows: the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants has been initially established; party and Communist Youth League backbone members have begun to form a leadership core; most members have the determination and confidence to take the socialist road, and production enthusiasm and patriotic and cooperative spirit have been improved to a certain extent; and the management of the cooperatives has been somewhat improved.
    Before the rectification, the situation in these two thousand-plus cooperatives was basically the same: weak Party leadership, unable to form a leadership core; a weak political atmosphere, with the influence of capitalist ideology dominating; cadres' work style was undemocratic; and illegal landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries were relatively rampant. As a result, production was not good, management was chaotic, and some even experienced serious production cuts.
    In response to the above situation, when the local Party committees rectified these cooperatives, they generally adopted the following measures:
    (1) Using the method of class analysis to rectify the organization, establish the advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants, and strengthen the Party's core leadership. When carrying out this work, all localities adopted different measures based on the different situations of their own localities and cooperatives: for cooperatives with relatively pure organizational members, but weak leadership capabilities, and more serious capitalist and backward-sliding ideas, based on the principle of patient education, transformation, and improvement, rely on the active elements among them and connect the backbone members among the poor and lower-middle peasants. Through recalling and comparing the old and new societies, combined with posing questions such as: "If we don't do a mediocre job, who will lead if we don't lead?"; "Who is to blame for the poor management of the cooperative?"; "Are the enemies honest? What activities do they have if they are not honest?", debates were organized. Through debates, the line between the two roads was clearly drawn, and the idea of ​​passively regressing was criticized, greatly enhancing class consciousness. For cooperatives with impure organizations, or controlled by wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas, use the method of mobilizing the masses while rectifying the organization, first mobilizing the cadres and activists who were excluded, and relying on them to connect the basic masses. For individuals who seriously hinder the development of the movement, organizational measures are taken to reorganize the leadership and promote outstanding members among the poor and lower-middle peasants to leadership positions to form a new leadership core. For cooperatives directly or indirectly manipulated by enemies, it is first necessary to deeply connect and mobilize the active elements of the poor and lower-middle peasants, expose the illegal activities of the enemies, and after the class ranks have grown to a certain extent, mobilize the masses to extensively air views, debate, and continue to strike at the enemies. For example, in the Miwan Cooperative, the reactionary group headed by the counter-revolutionary element Zhang Dexin and the production team leader Li Yongxin secretly convened a secret meeting of four other production team leaders at the beginning of the movement, blocking the situation, confronting the work team, and threatening the masses, saying: "Whoever reports the situation to the work team will be struggled against after the movement." After the work team grasped this situation, it announced the dismissal of Zhang and Li from their positions as team leaders and placed them under production control at a mass meeting, greatly boosting morale and dispelling concerns. The movement then developed enthusiastically.
    (2) Rely on the class ranks and pay attention to rectifying while correcting: The main defect of the third-category cooperatives is the lack of a strong class rank, so in this movement, all localities have paid attention to timely organizing a large basic team mainly composed of Party members, Communist Youth League members, and active members among the poor and lower-middle peasants. Rely on them to inspire and mobilize the broad masses, and organize a climax of airing views. In addition, the contradictions between the enemy and us and the internal contradictions among the people in these cooperatives are relatively sharp. When the airing of views was initially launched, the vast majority of the masses adopted a wait-and-see attitude, with heavy ideological concerns, and individual illegal landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries continued to carry out sabotage activities, attempting to hinder the development of the movement. At this time, the key to reversing the masses' thinking is whether the cadres' attitude is firm and sincere, and whether they can promptly correct the correct opinions expressed by the masses. For example, after the masses of the Miwan Cooperative criticized the cadres for not participating in labor, the Party members immediately took the lead in moving their quilts to the fields and fighting drought with the masses. When the masses complained about the lack of drought resistance tools, the cooperative repaired two and bought three waterwheels according to its financial capacity. After the masses reported that team committee member Li Si embezzled, it was immediately investigated and recovered, and a public apology was made to the masses. These measures greatly boosted the morale of the masses, who generally reflected: "We didn't expect the problem to be solved so quickly, we can just raise any opinions we have." Therefore, the climax of airing views quickly unfolded.
    (3) Strictly grasp policies and treat two types of contradictions with different natures separately. In the third-category cooperatives, the internal contradictions among the people and the contradictions between the enemy and us are often mixed. In the movement, all localities strictly paid attention to distinguishing between the rational opinions and correct suggestions of the masses and anti-socialist activities, distinguishing between the one-sided and erroneous views of the peasants and malicious attacks, and distinguishing between the erroneous words and deeds of general wealthy middle peasants and the reactionary words and deeds of landlords and rich peasants, thereby correctly handling two types of contradictions with different natures and basically ensuring the healthy development of the movement.
    (4) In the great debate and after the great debate, many agricultural cooperatives, in accordance with the Central Committee's three instructions on rectifying agricultural cooperatives and the rationalization proposals aired by the members, closely combined with current production, and from the aspects of management, financial system, and mutual benefit policies, conducted serious discussions and research by the masses to carry out rectification, formulate production plans, and set off a production upsurge. The attendance rate of some cooperatives has increased from about 60% to about 90% at present.

    河南省农村整风先抓薄弱环节
    运用阶级路线整顿三类社
    两千三百多个三类社跃升为一、二类社
    本报讯　河南广大农村在社会主义教育运动中，通过大鸣大放大争大改以后，据六十三个县统计，已有二千三百多个三类社（约占原有三类社数65％）改变了落后面貌，分别跃进到一类或二类社的水平。目前这些社的情况是：初步树立了贫农和下中农的领导优势；党团骨干开始形成了领导核心；多数社员有了走社会主义道路的决心和信心，生产情绪和爱国爱社思想有了一定的提高；社的经营管理有了某些改善。
    整改以前，这两千多个社的情况基本相同：党的领导薄弱，形不成领导核心；政治空气不浓，资本主义思想影响占优势；干部作风不民主；不法地主、富农、反革命分子较为猖狂。因而生产搞的不好，经营管理混乱，有的还严重减产。
    针对以上情况，各地党委对这些社进行整顿的时候，大体都采取了以下几个措施：
    （一）用阶级分析的方法整顿组织，树立了贫农和下中农优势，加强了党的核心领导。进行这一工作时，各地均根据本地、本社不同情况，采取不同的措施：对组织成员比较纯洁、但领导能力弱、且资本主义与退坡思想较严重的社，根据耐心教育，改造提高的方针，依靠其中的积极分子，串连骨干中的贫农、下中农。通过对新旧社会的回忆对比，结合提出：我们不干中不中，我们不领导叫谁领导；合作社办不好怨社怨人；敌人老实不老实，不老实都有那些活动等题目组织辩论。通过辩论，划清两条道路的是非界限，批判了消极退坡思想。大大的提高了阶级觉悟。对组织不纯，或为资本主义思想严重的富裕中农所掌权的社，用边发动群众、边整顿组织的办法，首先把被排斥的干部积极分子发动起来，依靠他们串连基本群众。对个别严重阻碍运动开展者，采取组织处理的办法，改组领导，把贫农、下中农中的优秀分子，提到领导岗位上来，以组成新的领导核心。对敌人直接或间接操纵的社，首先要深入的串连发动贫农、下中农积极分子，揭发敌人的不法活动，在阶级队伍成长到一定程度以后，再发动群众大鸣大放大争，继续打击敌人。如米湾社在运动初期，以漏纲反革命分子、生产队长张德欣、李永欣为首的反动集团，曾暗地召集另四个生产队长秘密开会，封锁情况，和工作组对抗，并威胁群众说：“谁向工作组反映情况，运动后全村斗他”。工作组掌握这些情况后，在群众大会上宣布撤销张、李两人队长职务并管制生产。大大振奋了人心，解除了顾虑，运动接着火热地开展起来。
    （二）依靠阶级队伍，注意边整边改：三类社的主要缺陷就是没有一支坚强的阶级队伍，因而在这次运动中，各地都注意及时组织了一支庞大的、以党团员和贫农、下中农中的积极分子为主的基本队伍。又依靠他们去启发鼓动广大群众，组织鸣放高潮。另外这些社敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾都比较尖锐，最初发动鸣放时，绝大部分群众抱观望态度，思想顾虑重重，个别不法地主富农反革命分子，则继续进行破坏活动，企图阻碍运动开展。这个时候扭转群众思想的关键，就要看干部态度是否坚决诚恳，对群众已鸣放出的正确意见能否及时改正。如米湾社群众批评干部不参加劳动以后，党员即带头将被子搬到地里和群众一起抗旱。群众嫌抗旱工具不足时，社里根据经济能力，修好了两部、买了三部水车。群众检举队委李四贪污，查实后立即追了出来，并公开向群众作了检讨。这些措施对群众情绪鼓舞很大。普遍反映：“咱也没想到能这样快解决问题，我们有啥意见可只管提好了”。因而鸣放高潮很快开展起来。
    （三）严格掌握政策，分别对待两类不同性质的矛盾。三类社中人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾，常常是互相混杂的，各地在运动中都严格注意把群众的合理意见，正确建议和反社会主义的活动区别开来，把农民的片面错误观点和恶意的攻击区别开来，把一般富裕中农的错误言行和地富的反动言行区别开来，从而正确的处理了两类不同性质的矛盾，基本上保证了运动的健康发展。
    （四）在大辩论中和大辩论后，很多农业社还遵照中央关于整顿农业社的三个指示和社员鸣放出来的合理化建议，紧密结合当前生产，从经营管理、财务制度、互利政策等方面，通过群众认真的讨论研究进行整改，制定了生产规划，掀起了生产高潮。有些社出勤率由原来的60％左右，提高到了目前的90％左右。
