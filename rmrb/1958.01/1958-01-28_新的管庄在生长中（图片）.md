    New Guanzhuang is Growing

    While the struggle to eliminate the "independent kingdom" of Guanzhuang is still intensely underway, a new atmosphere has already begun to emerge. In the past two months or so, there have been very few theft cases, and people no longer worry about their clothes being stolen when they go to work. The phenomena of children fighting in groups, disrupting meetings in government offices, and damaging public property have disappeared. In the police station, one can often hear stories of people picking up lost items and not pocketing them, such as handing over found pens and fur hats to the police. After the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests before the New Year, the environmental sanitation has greatly changed.

    Picking up lost items and not pocketing them is a common occurrence at the police station. Little friend Zhou Maijun brought a found fur hat to the police station.

    In order to further strengthen ties with the countryside, representatives from Guanzhuang's government offices (the two in the middle) are discussing ways to strengthen ties with cadres from Changguan Township.

    Families in Guanzhuang actively clean up the environment and are no longer lagging behind in the patriotic health campaign.

    These five young female cadres are all middle school graduates from Shanghai. They came to work at the Cement Design Institute of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry in Guanzhuang in 1956. They are writing letters home, telling their families about the new situation in Guanzhuang.

    新的管庄在生长中
    当消灭管庄“自由王国”的斗争还在激烈进行的时候，新的气象已经开始出现。最近两个多月来已很少发生偷盗案件，人们上班时不再担心自己的衣物会被盗窃。儿童成群打架、扰乱机关会场、损坏公物等现象儿已绝迹。在派出所里经常可以听到拾金不昧的事，他们把拾到的钢笔、皮帽子等物交给民警。在新年前进行了除四害爱国卫生运动后，环境卫生面貌大大改变。

    拾金不昧是派出所经常遇到的事。周迈均小朋友把拾到的一顶皮帽送到派出所里来。
    为进一步加强与农村的联系，管庄的机关代表（中间两人）在和长管乡干部研究密切联系的办法。
    管庄的家属积极打扫环境卫生，他们在爱国卫生运动中不再落后。
    这五个青年女干部都是上海的中学生。她们是1956年才来到管庄建筑材料工业部水泥设计院工作的。她们正在给家里写信，告诉管庄的新情况。
