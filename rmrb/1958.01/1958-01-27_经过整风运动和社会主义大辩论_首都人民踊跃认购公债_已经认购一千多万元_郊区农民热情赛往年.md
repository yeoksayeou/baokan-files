Xinhua News Agency, 24th Dispatch: The people of the capital are enthusiastically subscribing to the 1958 National Economic Construction Bonds. In just half a month, subscriptions have already reached 10.26 million yuan, exceeding more than half of the city's projected sales target for this year.

This year, the characteristics of bond sales in the capital are: "Fast speed, large subscriptions." Through the Rectification Campaign and the Socialist Great Debate, the enthusiasm of the masses for purchasing bonds to build socialism is particularly high. More than ninety central government organs completed their sales tasks, exceeding their projected figures, within two or three days. Staff members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Trade stationed abroad even sent telegrams to subscribe to bonds. In many government organs and factories, miners lined up to subscribe to bonds. Some units exceeded their projected sales tasks in less than half an hour or an hour.

This year, suburban farmers' enthusiasm for subscribing to government bonds is even higher than in previous years. At mobilization meetings for bond sales, farmers generally reflected, "Last year was a great harvest, this year is a great leap forward, buying more bonds is beneficial to the country and to ourselves." As of today, many districts, townships, and towns in the suburbs have exceeded their projected sales tasks. Farmers in five townships in Fengtai District, including Huangtugang and Lugouqiao, also paid off more than 50,000 yuan in subscribed bond payments in one go. The person in charge of this district said, "In previous years, farmers were still subscribing to bonds gradually until October, but never have they paid off all the bond payments so quickly as this year."

The increasing atmosphere of diligence and thrift enables many workers to subscribe to more bonds. Wang Shenzhi, Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Supervision, is usually very frugal in his daily life. Before buying bonds, he and his family made a savings calculation and bought 400 yuan worth of bonds, which is 50 yuan more than last year. Zhao Tiejun, a grain and forage cadre from the Dongjiao District People's Committee, had his burden reduced after his family returned to their hometown to engage in production last year. He rarely spends money on anything other than food. This time, he took out 100 yuan from his savings to buy government bonds.

    经过整风运动和社会主义大辩论
    首都人民踊跃认购公债
    已经认购一千多万元  郊区农民热情赛往年
    新华社24日讯  首都人民踊跃认购1958年国家经济建设公债，在半个月时间里，已经认购了一千零二十六万，超过今年全市预计推销数额的一半以上。
    今年，首都推销公债的特点是：“速度快，认购多。”广大群众通过整风运动和社会主义大辩论，对购买公债建设社会主义的热情特别高涨。中央九十多个机关在两三天内，就都超过预计数字完成了推销任务。外交部和对外贸易部驻在外国的工作人员，还打电报来认购公债。在许多机关和厂矿企业中，职工们都列队认购公债。有的单位不到半小时或一小时就超额完成了预计推销任务。
    郊区农民今年认购公债的热情比往年更高。在动员推销公债大会上，农民们普遍反映：“去年大丰收，今年大跃进，多买些公债，对国家，对自己都有好处。”到今天为止，郊区许多区乡、镇都已超额完成了预计的推销任务。丰台区的黄土岗、芦沟桥等五个乡的农民，还一次交清了五万多元认购的公债款。这个区的负责人说：“往年到10月份，农民们还在陆续认购公债，从没有像今年这样快就把公债款全部交清的。”
    勤俭节约风气的增长，使许多职工都愿多认购些公债。北京市监察局局长王慎之平日生活很俭朴，在购买公债前，他和自己的家属做了节约计算，买了四百元公债，比去年又多购买了五十元。东郊区人民委员会粮秣干事赵铁军去年动员家属回乡生产后，负担减轻了，平常自己除吃饭以外，很少花钱。这次，他从储蓄款里拿出一百元人民币购买了公债。
