The Relationship Between Thrift in Managing a Household and Thrift in Nation-Building
Xie Juezai

Editor's Note: The article "The Relationship Between Thrift in Managing a Household and Thrift in Nation-Building," published today, is the conclusion that the editorial department requested Comrade Xie Juezai to write for the discussion on "Is This Wasteful?".

Since the publication of Comrade Huang Xiuying's letter in the supplement on January 5th, a total of 2,791 letters participating in the discussion have been received in nineteen days (ending on the 24th). Judging from the letters, some units have organized discussions on this issue; more people have criticized Huang Xiuying's erroneous ideas and examined their own thoughts and actions in connection with them; some have very sincerely introduced their practices in thrifty housekeeping; of course, there are also a few individuals whose ideological understanding is basically the same as Huang Xiuying's. However, it is regrettable that these valuable letters could not be published in large numbers. Due to space limitations, the newspaper only selected a part of the letters and published them in five concentrated installments.

However, from another perspective, although not many letters have been published, this issue has already attracted the attention of a wide range of readers, especially with Old Xie helping us write a concluding article. We can believe that after this discussion, everyone will have a further understanding of the significance of thrifty housekeeping. This is a major gain.

The old saying "The foundation of the nation is the home" has new and greater significance in today's socialist economic construction.

China has a population of over 640 million. Averaging five people per household, there are approximately 130 million households, which together form the "big family" of the People's Republic of China. The "small family" relies on the "big family" for leadership and protection, and the "big family" relies on the "small family" as its solid foundation. Political, economic, and cultural life are all "closely related."

"If there is no water in the big river, the small river will run dry." The more water in the big river, the more water there will be in the small river. Everyone hopes for the prosperity and strength of the motherland, so that we can live more happily in it. Similarly, "If there is no water in the small river, the big river will also run dry." If the water in the small river is all leaked away and does not flow or flows little into the big river, the water in the big river will be shallow and unable to exert the benefits of irrigation and navigation, and the entire basin will not be able to be moisturized.

Since liberation, the Party and the government have called on the people to build the country through diligence and thrift, run enterprises through diligence and thrift, run cooperatives through diligence and thrift, and manage households through diligence and thrift; to produce more, consume less, and invest the stored part in expanded reproduction. After several years of hard work, we have accumulated a considerable amount of capital, built many undertakings, and greatly changed China's historically backward face. However, if we are more diligent and thrifty, even more diligent and thrifty on the basis of what we have already achieved, the strength and speed of construction will inevitably be even more astonishing.

People's consumption always passes through the "home." If 130 million families each save one yuan, that is 130 million yuan; if they save ten yuan, that is 1.3 billion yuan. But many people don't think this way, thinking that I spend my own money, and others and the government can't interfere. Yes, others and even the government will not interfere with you, but you must interfere with yourself. Just think, before you had your own government, was your life this good? Hunger and cold forced you, you shouldn't "forget the pain once the scar is healed." Having turned over under the leadership of your own government, you must cherish the government with all your heart. The best way to cherish it is to help the government accumulate capital and expand production.

Why didn't we promote thrifty housekeeping like this in the past few years? In the past few years, many "homes" did not have enough or only enough to keep warm and fed, but now many "homes" are not only warm and fed but also have a surplus. If there is a surplus, we must be thrifty. When agricultural cooperatives were first established, the government advocated deducting less and distributing more. Now, the State Council has decided that the public accumulation fund of agricultural cooperatives can exceed 8%, and cooperatives operating economic crops can exceed 12%. This is the reason.

Some people say: In the past, people were thrifty in order to buy land to leave to their children and grandchildren, to guard against unemployment, and to guard against old age. Now that children are born, society will arrange jobs for them, and there is labor insurance for unemployment and disease, and they can receive pensions when they are old. The purpose of thrift has disappeared.

Yes, society has changed, and the purpose of thrift has also changed, becoming greater and more meaningful, but it is not that we should not be thrifty. As mentioned above, the water in the big river relies on the flow from many small rivers; to extend it further, we are not only for satisfying individual needs, but also for satisfying everyone's needs. For example, in terms of grain, the country produced 370 billion jin of grain in 1957, an increase of one-third compared to before liberation, but the average per person is still less than 600 jin of coarse grains, and some places have more and some places have less. This year, various agencies in Beijing are calling for saving grain. Some households reduce five jin per month, some reduce three jin, and some reduce even more. No one feels that they are not eating enough, but the total savings are very large and can be used for national regulation and storage. Another example is clothing. Everyone should have new clothes to wear, but it is by no means possible not to wear old clothes and patched clothes. Wear new clothes less often and old clothes more often, and a set of new clothes can be worn for several more years. If you buy one piece after another, then even though cotton production has increased a lot, the supply of cotton cloth will inevitably still be insufficient, increasing the tension in the market. Furthermore, what we want to arrange for our children and grandchildren is not to leave them some exploitative capital, but to leave them a prosperous society with good conditions for fully developing diligent production; what we want to arrange for ourselves is also to create a society where "the widowed, orphaned, lonely, and disabled are all provided for," and "the elderly are at peace, and the young are cared for," rather than relying on others for help. All of these require us to be greatly diligent and greatly thrifty in order to achieve them. The nationwide great diligence and thrift is the result of the accumulation of small diligence and thrift by every "home" and every individual.

Thrifty housekeeping, depositing more money in the bank, and saving social materials are beneficial to the country; similarly, it is also very beneficial for individuals to have savings and not to ask people or the government for relief when they have difficulties.

The words "diligence" and "thrift" are often used together. Diligent people know that "every thread and every grain comes from hard work" and cherish them when they use them; lazy people "don't feel pain when children use their father's money" and are young masters who don't know what thrift is. Some people say: "The money is earned by my work, and I should enjoy it." This seems to make sense, but it is actually abnormal. If such a person encounters something that can be "obtained without labor," he will definitely not be diligent. Because he wants to show off his life and not let things that he can do without be used by others. To put it bluntly, individualistic exploitative thoughts are at work in his mind.

Such a person spends money recklessly when he has it, and when he has no money, he will definitely complain that the organization does not take care of him. In fact, the organization has taken care of him, giving him work and giving him the possibility of saving, but he himself does not take care of himself.

If you were to ask such a person to manage public property, he would definitely be very wasteful, spending public money like "water pushing sand," not even bothering to look at it. It can be concluded that many of the shocking waste incidents revealed in the newspapers are directly attributable to people who are not diligent and thrifty in managing their households. There are also such people who cherish their own property very much but do not cherish public property at all, always wanting to steal from the public. This is because he has not received basic socialist education. When he steals a lot from the public, money comes easily, and he will inevitably not be diligent and thrifty in managing his household.

We must be diligent and thrifty in managing our households, and we must even more make thrifty housekeeping and thrifty nation-building form a flesh-and-blood connection. This principle has already been understood by many people (including housewives). For example, in rural areas, water conservancy is being built enthusiastically. The people contribute labor and invest money. The resources and labor saved by everyone are gathered together to build huge projects, and a bumper harvest will be obtained in a few months. This movement is spreading like a tide to various undertakings and departments, linking the thrift of the family and the country into one.

All people, especially people like Huang Xiuying, should be educated to understand this principle.

### 勤俭持家与勤俭建国的关系

    勤俭持家与勤俭建国的关系
    谢觉哉
    编者按：今天发表的“勤俭持家与勤俭建国的关系”这篇文章，是编辑部约请谢觉哉同志为“这是浪费吗？”的讨论所作的结论。
    自从1月5日副刊发表了黄秀英同志的来信以后，在十九天中（截至24日止），共收到参加讨论的来信达二千七百九十一件。从来信看，有些单位曾经就这个问题组织了讨论；更多的人对黄秀英的错误思想作了批判，并且联系自己的思想和行为进行了检查；也有的人，非常诚恳地介绍了自己在勤俭持家方面的做法；当然，还有个别人的思想认识和黄秀英基本上相同。但是遗憾的是，这些宝贵的来信未能大量发表。报纸由于篇幅的限制，仅仅选择了来信中的一部分，集中地发表了五次。
    不过，从另一方面来看，尽管来信发表的不多，但是这个问题在广大读者中已经引起了注意，特别是谢老帮助我们写了结论性的文章，我们可以相信，经过这次讨论，大家对勤俭持家的意义就会有进一步的认识。这就是重大的收获。
    “国之本在家”这句古老的话，在社会主义经济建设的今天，更有新的和更伟大的意义。
    我国人口有六亿四千多万，平均以五口之家计，约一亿三千万户，即一亿三千万家合起来成为中华人民共和国的“大家”。“小家”靠“大家”来领导、保护，“大家”又靠“小家”做她的稳实的基础。政治生活、经济生活、文化生活，都是“息息相关”的。
    “大河里无水小河里干”，大河里水越多，小河里就也都有水了。谁都盼望祖国繁荣富强，为的是我们更幸福地生活在里面。同样，“小河里无水大河里也干”，如果小河里的水都被渗漏掉了，不流或少流到大河里去，大河里水浅了，不能发挥灌溉航运的效益，整个流域就无法润泽起来。
    解放以来，党和政府号召人民勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办合作社、勤俭持家，多生产、少消费、把储存的部分作为扩大再生产的投资。经过几年的努力，我们积累了相当多的资金，建设了许多事业，大大地改变了我国历来落后的面貌。但是，如果更勤俭一些，在已经获得的基础上更勤俭一些，建设的力量和速度必然更为惊人。
    人们的消费，总是经过“家”的。一亿三千万个家，每个家节约一元是一亿三千万元；节约十元，是十三亿元。但不少人不这样想，以为我花我的钱，别人管不着，政府也管不着。是的，别人、甚至政府不会来管你，可是你自己却非管不可。试想，没有自己的政府以前，你的生活有这样好吗？饥冻逼着你，你不应“好了疮疤忘了痛”。在自己的政府领导下翻了身，必须万分地爱护政府。爱护的最好办法是帮助政府积累资金，扩大生产。
    为什么前几年不这样宣传勤俭持家呢？前几年很多的“家”不够或仅够温饱，现在则有很多“家”不仅温饱而且有余了。有余就要节俭。农业合作社初办时，政府主张少扣多分，现在国务院决定农业社的公积金可以超过8％，经营经济作物的合作社可以超过12％就是这个道理。
    有人说：以前的人节俭，为的是买田地遗子孙，防备失业、防备老。现在子孙出世，社会会为他们安排工作，失业、疾病有劳动保险，老了可领退休金，节俭的目的已没有了。
    是的，社会是变了，节俭的目的也变了，变成更大更有意义，而不是不要节俭。上面说过，大河里的水靠许多小河里流来；更推广地说，我们不只为着满足个人的需要，还要为着满足人人的需要。比如粮食，1957年全国产粮三千七百亿斤，比解放前增加了三分之一，但平均每人还不足六百斤粗粮，而且有的地方多，有的地方不足。今年北京各机关号召节约粮食，有的户每月减五斤，有的减三斤，有的减得更多，谁也没有感到吃的不够，但总起来的节约数字就很大，可以作为国家的调剂和储蓄之用。又如衣服，人人都应该有新衣服穿，但决不是就可以不穿旧衣服和补丁衣。穿新衣的时候少些，穿旧衣的时候多些，一身新衣就可以多穿几年。如果你置一件又置一件，那尽管棉花生产已增加很多，棉布供应必然仍是不足，增加市面上的紧张。再就是我们要为子孙安排的，不是遗给他们一些剥削的资本，而是遗给他们一个美好的有充分发展勤劳生产条件的富裕的社会；为本人安排的，也是创造一个“鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”“老者安之，少者怀之”的社会，而不是倚靠别人帮助。这些，都要我们大勤大俭，才能做到。全国的大勤大俭，是每个“家”、每个人小勤小俭累积的结果。
    勤俭持家，向银行多存些款，节省社会上的物资，对国家有益；同样，个人有了储蓄，有困难不要向人或向政府要救济，益处也很大。
    勤俭二字是并称的。勤的人知道“一丝一粟，来处不易”，用起来很爱惜；不勤的人“子用父钱心不痛”，是大少爷，不知道俭为何事。有人说：钱是我工作得来的，应该自己享受掉。”这话似乎有道理，但其实是反常的，这种人如遇到可以“不劳而获”，他一定不勤了。因为他要夸耀自己的生活，不让自己可以不用的东西作他人之用。戳穿说，脑子里有个人主义的剥削思想在作祟。
    这种人，有钱乱花，到了无钱时，他一定又埋怨组织不照顾他，实际组织照顾了他，给他工作，给他有储蓄的可能，而是他自己不照顾自己。
    这种人，如果要他管公家财物，一定很浪费，用公家钱像“水推沙”，看都懒得看。可以断定：报纸上揭发的许多惊人的浪费事件，那些直接负浪费责任的人，一定是不勤俭持家的人。也有这样的人，很爱惜自己的财物，却很不爱惜公家的财物，总想揩公家的油。这是他还没有受过起码的社会主义的教育。在他揩公家油多了的时候，钱来得易，必然持家也不勤俭了。
    我们要勤俭持家，更要使勤俭持家与勤俭建国结成血肉般的联系。这个道理已经为许多群众（包括主妇们）所了解。比如农村热火朝天地修水利，人民出力又投资，各人节约下的资和力，集起来建成巨大的工程，几个月后就要获得丰收。这个运动，正潮水似地传到各种事业、各个部门，使家与国的勤俭联为一体。
    应该教育所有的人，尤其像黄秀英这样的人，懂得这个道理。
