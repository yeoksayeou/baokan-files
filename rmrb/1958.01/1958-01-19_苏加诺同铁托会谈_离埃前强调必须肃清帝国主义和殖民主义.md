    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 17th – Indonesian President Sukarno and his entourage left here by special plane on the morning of the 17th for Belgrade. At the invitation of Yugoslav President Tito, he will visit Belgrade for two days.
    On the eve of his departure, Sukarno issued a message to the Egyptian people, thanking them and the Egyptian leaders for their warm reception, saying that this reception was evidence of the close friendship between Indonesia and Egypt.
    Sukarno said that Egypt's experience in the Suez Canal War, the West Irian issue currently existing in Indonesia, and the economic and military pressure exerted by large countries on small countries, show that imperialism and colonialism are not dead. Imperialism and colonialism are still threatening the sound development of the course of human history, and people must still concentrate their efforts on eliminating these scourges.
    He said that many Asian and African countries are engaged in a struggle to "have their status recognized." He pointed out that Indonesia and Egypt are in the same boat in the struggle, sharing weal and woe.
    He said: "At the Bandung Conference, we have sown the seeds of common goals and mutual understanding. This visit to your great country, in addition to making me feel mentally refreshed, has also more concretely realized the spirit of the Bandung Conference."
