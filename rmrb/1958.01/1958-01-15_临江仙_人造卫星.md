    Linjiang Xian
    Artificial Satellite

    Qian Changzhao

    Forty years saw three transformations, the East Wind prevails over the West Wind;
    The wisdom of workers and peasants is boundless, two stars admired by all, brilliantly crossing the sky.
    Diligently explore the mysteries of the universe, righteous conduct serves the world;
    The heart that defends peace is the same, we should also be vigilant, lest the goblins are lurking.

    人造卫星
    钱昌照四十年间三转折，东风压倒西风；工农智慧本无穷，两星人尽望，灿烂过长空。宇宙秘奇勤探讨，道行天下为公；和平保卫此心同，还应加警惕，魑魅未潜踪。
