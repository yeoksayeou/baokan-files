Old Fogies and Young Masters
Chen Tianqi

I have seen two kinds of old fogies and young masters from old times. One kind existed after the Xinhai Revolution and the May Fourth Movement, and the other only appeared after the socialist revolution.

When I was little, twenty years or so after the Xinhai Revolution, I still saw such people: he braided his white hair into a long queue and coiled it on his head. His clothing, demeanor, and expression were all ancient, his mouth full of imperial examination etiquette, lamenting the decline of morality. When this kind of old man walked down the street, a large group of children followed and surrounded him, feeling very strange. This was a loyalist of the former Qing Dynasty.

I didn't have the chance to see the fine demeanor of the Qing Dynasty's young masters, but the scholars of Chinese culture since the Republic of China, those revivalists, and the like of Shi Zhecun, I estimate that many of them were the young masters of that time.

After the socialist Three Great Transformations, a new kind of old fogy and young master appeared in China. They shouted "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," clamored for a "bicameral system," advocated democratic individualism, demanded a private system, and proposed things like "liberating individuality"... and so on.

The former old fogies and young masters were the orphaned subjects and illegitimate sons of the feudal dynasty, while the latter were the propagandists and defenders of capitalism. Although one was infatuated with the era of shouting "Long live the Emperor," and the other yearned for the century of free competition, they had something in common. That is: they are passionately fond of the old and hate the new like crazy. However, the tide of the times will not flow backwards after all, and the sorrow of the old fogies and young masters lies here.

The old fogies and young masters hold an arrogant attitude of "going their own way," and they find the new reality displeasing to the eye, so they cannot understand the new spirit of the times and become increasingly lonely. In the end, they can only grow old and die in loneliness with a helpless mood, becoming the last batch of martyrs of the old era.

The consciousness and habits of the old era are a heavy burden for people. If you don't let it go, it will overwhelm you. The times have changed, and the vast majority of people can eliminate accumulated habits, change old consciousness, and adapt to the new era in which they live. But there are bound to be a few people who will stick to it.

For the old intellectuals, the consciousness of the old era is particularly stubborn. They have drilled deep and immersed themselves thoroughly in the old era and the old society, and they know a lot about outdated things. It is easy to regard things that are out of date in their own country or abroad as treasures, and to clash with the new reality. In the forty years since the Xinhai Revolution, China has undergone two major changes of the times, and the two kinds of old-fashioned figures have joined forces. Those intellectuals with feudal consciousness are bound to be even more jealous of the newer socialism.

Therefore, it is not surprising that Shi Zhecun and his like today are cursing the Communist Party and socialism.

When I was studying at school, I met such a professor of Chinese classics: he told us that he would recite the "Analects" once every morning and evening, which he had done for thirty years without fail. Once during his lecture, we passed him a note asking: "Confucius advocated a three-year mourning period. Mozi advocated simple burial, is there anything wrong with that?" Unexpectedly, when the gentleman saw the note, he burst into tears and choked with sobs. Finally, he quoted Confucius's four words to his disciples, "Is it comfortable in your heart?" to answer us. Eight or nine years have passed, and last year I saw in the newspaper that this gentleman was a rightist, and I was not surprised. From the three-year mourning period to socialism, what a distant distance!

From this, it can be seen that the transformation of intellectuals is not just a matter of taking off the mandarin jacket and putting on a gown, or taking off the gown and putting on a uniform. What is needed is a complete transformation. It is necessary to fight resolutely against the old consciousness and old ideas in oneself, and it requires the courage and determination of a hero to break his wrist. Going to the countryside and going up the mountains is the road to complete transformation.

Old fogies and young masters all retain strong old-fashioned thoughts, feelings, and habits, but not all old people are old fogies. We often say that some people "are old but not old at heart." In the eight years since liberation and construction, many old people feel that they are getting younger and younger. But young masters are not necessarily all born in the old era. In the past, there were young lads who were born after the Xinhai Revolution, who stayed at home in their teens holding babies and smoking water pipes, and learned to shake their legs while sitting. Today, there is also a Liu Shaotang, who is only in his twenties, but he brings things from the foreign bourgeoisie of two hundred years ago to sell in the new China.

The old fogies and young masters of the feudal era have completely declined. The old fogies and young masters of capitalism are also in disillusionment. In less than twenty years, when children encounter those "democratic individualists," they will feel as strange as I did when I was a child seeing old men with braids.

### 遗老和遗少

    遗老和遗少
    陈天启
    我已经见过两种旧时代的遗老和遗少了。一种是辛亥革命、五四运动之后的，一种则是社会主义革命之后才出现的。
    我小的时候，离辛亥革命已有二十来年了，但还看见过那样的人：他把白发编成长辫子，盘在头上。他的服装、举止、神气都很古气，满嘴科举礼教，感喟人心不古。这种老人走到街上，惹得大群的孩子跟着、围着瞧看，感到很奇异。这是前清的遗老。
    清朝的遗少，我不得瞻其丰采，但民国以后的国粹派，那些复古主义者，以及第三种人如施蛰存者流，估计其中不少也就是当年的遗少。
    社会主义三大改造以后，在中国，又出现了一种新的遗老和遗少。他们呼号“自由、博爱、平等”，叫嚷“两院制”，主张民主个人主义，要求私有制度，提出什么“解放个性”……等等。
    前一种遗老和遗少是封建王朝的孤臣孽子，后一种则是资本主义的宣扬者与卫道者。虽然他们一则迷恋着山呼“吾皇万岁”的时代，一则向往着自由竞争的世纪，但他们却有其相同之点。这便是：嗜旧如痴，厌新如狂。可是，时代的潮流毕竟不会倒流，遗老和遗少的悲哀也就在这里。
    遗老和遗少抱着傲世的态度“我行我素”，看新的现实都不顺眼，他们就不可能理解新的时代精神，便愈来愈孤独。最后，只有怀着无可奈何的心情而寂寞地老去、死去。成为旧时代最后一批的殉葬者。
    旧时代的意识和习惯，对于人们是一副重担。你不放下它，它就会压倒你。时代变了，绝大多数的人都能革除积习，改变旧的意识，与所处的新时代相适应。但也必然有少数的人要死守着它。
    对于旧的知识分子，旧时代的意识特别顽固。他们在旧时代、旧社会里钻进得深，浸溺得透，知道陈旧的东西特别多。就很容易把本国、或是外国过了时的东西奉为珪宝。而与新的现实抵触。辛亥革命以来四十年，中国发生了两次极大的时代变化，前后两种遗旧的人物接了头。那些带有封建意识的知识分子，对于更新的社会主义，势必更加嫉视。
    所以，今天施蛰存之流破口大骂共产党和社会主义，说来也无甚为奇。
    我在学校念书时，曾经碰见这样一位国学教授：他告诉我们说，他每天朝昏必朗读“论语”各一次，已经是三十年如一日了。有次他讲课中，我们递了张条子问他：“孔主三年之丧。墨主薄葬，有何不可？”不料这位先生看了条子，竟是热泪盈眶，悲哽不成声。最后引用了孔子答弟子的“于心安乎”四个字来回答我们。八、九年过去了，去年我从报上看到这位先生是个右派，我也就不觉奇怪。从三年之丧到社会主义，有多么遥远的距离！
    由此可见，知识分子改造，不是脱了马褂换长袍，脱了长袍换制服就算得数的。需要的是脱胎换骨。要与自己身上的旧意识、旧思想斗争决绝，需要有壮士断腕的勇气与决心。下乡、上山，便是脱胎换骨的道路。
    遗老和遗少都保有着浓厚的旧时代的思想、感情、习气，但老人不都是遗老，我们常说有的人“人老心不老”，解放建国八年以来，多少老年人感到愈活愈年青。而遗少却不一定都是生长在旧时代，过去曾有过辛亥革命以后出世的小后生，十几岁便守在家里抱娃娃，捧水烟壶，学会了架脚抖腿。今天也有个刘绍棠，年纪才二十多两岁，却把二百年前外国资产阶级的东西，拿到新中国来贩卖。
    封建时代的遗老和遗少已经完全没落了。资本主义的遗老、遗少也在幻灭中。用不到再等二十年，小孩子们碰到那些“民主个人主义”之徒，就要像我小时候看到梳辫子的老男人一样，感到稀奇了。
