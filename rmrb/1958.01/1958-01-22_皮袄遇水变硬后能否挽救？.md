    Can a Fur Coat Be Saved After It Gets Wet and Hardens?

    If a fur coat gets wet, we might immediately think of putting it next to a stove to dry it or laying it out in the sun to dry. But after it dries, you'll find that the areas that were wet have become hard and uneven. If the quality of the fur itself is poor, a lot of fur will fall out.

    Animal fur is mainly composed of protein, and the skin has many pores, and the fur also has a certain elasticity. However, the elasticity of animal skin is limited and not as elastic as ordinary rubber bands. If a piece of fur that has been soaked in water is allowed to evaporate slowly, these protein molecules can smoothly return to their original state. If the water is squeezed out suddenly, the protein molecules will not have time to shrink step by step, so they lose their elasticity and appear uneven. If the skin is baked for too long, the protein molecules will become brittle, some will even turn yellow, and the hair roots will also fall off the dermis.

    In order to avoid this kind of loss caused by moisture, when a fur coat is stained with dirty water or soaked in water, you can use clean cold water to wipe the wet and dirty areas clean. Then use a dry towel to gently wipe it, try to absorb as much water as possible, and then take it to a ventilated and shady place to let it dry naturally.

    If a piece of wet fur has already been baked hard, then you can re-wet it with clean water, then repeatedly rub it with a dry towel, and let it dry naturally using the above method, which can often be remedied. Of course, if the skin has become as hard as a board and the fur has started to fall out, then it can no longer restore its original elasticity.

    Some people use salt and alum water (one penny of salt and two pennies of alum in one liter of water) to rub and wash a slightly hardened fur coat, which can also restore its elasticity. Because this alum solution can soften the gelatinous substance in the skin, after rubbing it with this water, wash it with clean water and dry it in the shade. (He Yue)

### 皮袄遇水变硬后能否挽救？

    皮袄遇水变硬后能否挽救？
    皮袄被水浸湿了，我们也许马上想到要把它放在火炉旁边去烤干或是摆在太阳下晒干。可是等到干了之后，你就发现原来湿的地方变得硬崩崩的，而且凹凸不平。若是皮子本身的质量再差一些，就会有大量的毛脱落。
    动物的毛皮主要是由蛋白质组成的，皮上还有许多毛孔，皮毛也有一定的弹性。可是兽皮的弹性限度小，不像普通橡胶筋那样富于伸缩性。一块经水泡过的皮毛若是慢慢的让水分蒸发，这些蛋白质分子还可以顺利的恢复原状，若是骤然的把水挤出，蛋白质分子就来不及按部就班地缩小，于是就失去了弹性，显出凹凸不平。若是皮张烤久了，蛋白质分子就变脆了，有的甚至变得焦黄，毛根也从真皮上脱落下来。
    为了避免皮袄因受湿而产生这种损失，当皮袄被弄上污水或经水泡了之后，可用清洁的冷水把弄湿、弄脏的地方擦洗干净。再用干毛巾轻轻的擦拭，尽量把水分吸干些，然后拿到通风而背阴的地方使其自干。
    若是已经把一块湿皮子烤硬了，那么还可以再把它用清水浸湿，然后用干毛巾反复揉搓，用上述方法使其自干，这样往往可以补救。当然，若是皮子已变得像木板一样硬，而且毛也开始脱落的话，那就再也不能恢复原来的弹性了。
    有人用食盐和明矾水（一升水中放一钱食盐和两钱明矾）来揉洗稍有一点变硬了的皮袄，也可以恢复它的弹性。因为这种明矾溶液可使皮子中的成胶质柔软，用这种水揉过后，再用清水擦洗过阴干即可。　（禾曰）
