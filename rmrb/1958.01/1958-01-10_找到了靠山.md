Only Respecting Master Workers in Words

According to the inspection conducted by the Jiang'an Railway Station in Hankou during this rectification movement: this station, famous for the "February 7th" struggle, currently only has Gu Laozao as an "February 7th" veteran worker. However, the Party Committee Secretary only got to know him after working at Jiang'an for two years, and many cadres still don't know him to this day. Gu Laozao, with decades of production and political experience, voluntarily requested to change from Director Switchman to Switchman due to his age, and was only rated as a Level 2 during the evaluation. Some new workers who just entered the railway and had their positions determined received the same amount of salary as him. When the station was selecting cadres and developing Party membership, it only emphasized the old workers' low education and complex history, and did not see the advantages of the old workers. Therefore, old workers who could be promoted were not promoted, and those who could be admitted into the Party were not admitted. As a result, some young workers mistakenly believed: "What ability do master workers have? If they had any ability, they would have been promoted long ago." Some new workers called the old workers "Master" when they first signed the contract with the old workers; after their positions were determined, they called them "Old [Surname]"; when their piece-rate wages exceeded their masters', they called them "Old Backward." Many old workers were therefore in low spirits, saying: "Party members are managed by the Party, and young people are managed by the Communist Youth League, but no one manages us old folks."

The reason for this situation, as Party Committee Secretary Zhao Yuhao said, is: "We respect them as 'master workers' in words, but we do not rely on them in our minds." When many cadres mention old workers, they say: "Old workers, yes, they have a knack for production and a lot of experience, but their political thinking is not very good." Therefore, some comrades often only consult and research with old workers when they encounter difficulties in production, and rarely care for or take care of them based on their living characteristics and ideological characteristics.

Old Workers Also Have a Future

The Jiang'an Railway Station Party Committee only discovered this problem when they encountered difficulties that could not be solved. During the rectification movement, the masses raised more than 1,400 opinions and dealt with more than 1,200, but the masses still had opinions. The leadership couldn't figure out what was going on, so they convened a forum for old workers. The old workers raised a total of eight major issues, including criticisms of the leadership for not dealing with cadres who had made mistakes, criticisms of the cadres' work style, and criticisms of the lack of respect for old workers. Based on the opinions of the old workers, the Party Committee inspected and criticized the idea of not relying on old workers, and adopted two measures to earnestly mobilize old workers.

First, reasonably arrange the work of old workers and reasonably adjust the wage levels of old workers. For example, Gu Laozao was changed to a Level 1 Switchman, and Huang Dongshan's original salary was restored. Zhou Banghe, a shunter with more than 20 years of experience, was promoted to Duty Officer. These measures were supported by the workers. Huang Dongshan not only worked conscientiously, discovering someone stealing things from the station six times in a row, but also actively participated in learning and asked his wife (a Party member) at home: "What aspects should I strive for to join the Party? Please help me." Liu Yunguo, an old worker whose salary was not adjusted, was also elated, coming to work even on Sundays and singing "The East is Red, the Sun Rises" after work. Someone said: "Are you crazy?" He said: "I'm happy! In the new society, the elderly also have a future."

Second, cadres at all levels went to the homes of old workers "to ask for advice and have heart-to-heart talks." Originally, Ma Biaojun had a lot of opinions about the stationmaster, Liu Jichang. This time, Liu Jichang went to visit Ma Biaojun and first reviewed his shortcomings, which made Ma Biaojun anxious and say: "Things are over, why are you still reviewing! Stationmaster Liu, forget it, forget it." Later, several old workers also gathered around and said to Liu Jichang: "Stationmaster Liu, you sit down. You be the chairman today, and we'll give you our opinions. After we're done, we'll drink." Everyone talked very harmoniously and spoke their minds.

How Many Old Workers Have Caused Problems Due to Livelihood Issues?

During this visit, the cadres received the greatest education. Originally, some cadres believed that old workers were ideologically conservative and politically inactive, but the facts proved the opposite. Old workers have a high degree of class consciousness in dealing with the relationship between the individual and the collective, and between the individual and the country. Zhen Yushan's family lost two people in a row last year, and owed more than 100 yuan for treatment and burial expenses. When the union representative went to investigate and wanted to give him a subsidy, he refused. He said: "If everyone relies on public subsidies when they have difficulties, how will that work?" He quit smoking paper cigarettes, which he had been smoking for 32 years, saving six yuan each month. He also sold his leather coat and mobilized his wife to carry earth. He cleared his debt without any subsidies. Liu Wanshun frankly asked Comrade Zhao Yuhao: "Secretary Zhao, how many old workers over the age of 45 have caused you problems due to livelihood issues?" When talking about the relationship between freedom and discipline, almost every old worker criticized the current phenomenon of lax labor discipline at the station. Ma Biaojun told Stationmaster Liu Jichang: "Our group used to have 'Six Talks', all about production technology. Now it's 'Seven Talks', talking about movies, dramas, dancing, watches, bicycles, love, and piece-rate wages." Old worker Feng Baichuan reported: "The health station is irresponsible. Whoever asks for leave gets it, one day if not, they get two, three days if not, they get five. As soon as the young lads leave, they raise their sick leave slips and say: 'It's done!'" Old worker Zheng Guanqing said: "When we do work, we must do it as if it were our own family's business."

Chairman Jiang's Work Style Has Changed

Originally, some cadres believed that old workers had low education, weak ability, and couldn't even speak clearly. Facts have proved that old workers do have difficulty making reports at meetings, but they best understand the masses' thoughts and feelings, and solve problems in a way that convinces people. For example, Yang Mingwei wanted to exchange his broken raincoat for a new one, but the warehouse only had old ones. He argued with the administrator, and Gu Laozao happened to run into it. After Gu Laozao explained the actual difficulties and the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift to Yang Mingwei, he said: "You take the old one and wear it first. I'll give you the new one first next year when they're exchanged, and exchange it for your old one. Look, the raincoat I'm wearing now is worse than yours." Yang Mingwei was very embarrassed at the time and said: "How can I take Master Gu's?" He exchanged it for an old one and left.

Gu Laozao also serves as the labor protection committee member of the trade union. He has a high prestige among the masses. The young trade union chairman, Jiang Zhonglin, specially asked him for advice: "How can I do a good job in the trade union?" He said: "We must always understand the workers' needs and solve problems. For example, when it rains, it's best to have the administration call the roll ten minutes earlier before work, and you should tell everyone: 'Comrades, who didn't bring a raincoat? Those who live close should hurry home to get it, and those who live far away, we'll notify their families to send it.' Just doing this will move everyone. Usually, no one cares about this, and sometimes we get soaked in the rain while working a shift. Also, there have been more accidents recently, you should go to the site during the shift handover to take a look. If someone doesn't wear a safety belt, you should correct them on the spot and criticize them at the shift handover meeting the next day, and they will be satisfied." When Jiang Zhonglin followed Gu Laozao's advice, the workers generally reflected: "Chairman Jiang's work style has changed."

"Let Us Persuade These Comrades"

During the blooming and contending period at Jiang'an Railway Station, some workers also raised excessive demands, such as demanding pork rib soup when working the night shift, and demanding housing subsidies. The two most serious incidents were: First, the railway currently has two free tickets per person per year, but some people are not satisfied and demand the restoration of the old society's twelve free tickets per year. Second, the station currently has eighteen kinds of reward systems, but some people are not satisfied and demand the restoration of the old society's fourteen days of paid leave (each person can take fourteen days of leave per year without deduction of salary), and if no leave is taken, they can receive fourteen days of extra salary. Worker Liu Haisheng even said: "These fourteen days came from the 'February 7th' struggle, and you have canceled them!" This confused many people, making it impossible for some groups to continue the debate.

Of course, the station Party Committee quickly found out in the history of the "February 7th" struggle that the condition of fourteen days of paid leave was never mentioned at that time. However, how to persuade these workers to automatically cancel these excessive demands? Party Committee Secretary Zhao Yuhao said to the old workers: "How should these problems be solved? In the countryside, we consult with our uncles and elders. In enterprises, we ask the master workers to come up with ideas and solutions." Liu Zhengyuan immediately criticized the workers who made excessive demands, saying: "They haven't suffered the bitterness of the old days, so they don't know the sweetness of today. Just take working hours, in the past it was a two-shift system, working twelve hours a day, now it's three and a half shifts, and there are also long breaks, it couldn't be better. We should think for the country, without the country, where would we be! Our country's construction projects are one after another, and it's a long way to go. These people just want to grow into a 'big cabbage' overnight, there's no such thing!" Liu Yunguo also talked about how, in the past, when he wanted to join the railway, his father begged the section chief with the surname Liu many times, but he couldn't get in. Later, someone told his father: "You have to bribe the section chief, the money must be stuffed under his opium tray, propping the opium tray up." His father had to borrow 100 silver dollars to prop up the section chief's opium tray before he could join the railway, but he didn't get a penny for the first three months. He said: "These people are now assigned to a position as soon as they enter the railway, and it's more than 50 yuan, the same as the old workers, and they still demand this and demand that, they're really not content."

The old workers also specifically analyzed the issues of twelve free tickets and fourteen days of paid leave. Zheng Guanqing said: "In the past, there were twelve free tickets a year, who used them all up? I only used one a year. Running around with free tickets affects personal income and also affects national production." Zhen Yushan also specifically calculated the accounts: in the past, giving out fourteen days' wages was only thirty or forty yuan. When it came time to spend, prices soared and you couldn't buy anything. Now that this system has been canceled, there are many reward systems, and prices are stable. The safety bonus for switchmen alone is sixty or seventy yuan a year, more than fourteen days' wages, and it's very beneficial to production. Others added: "Shunters earn piece-rate wages, and some earn more in a month than the stationmaster's salary. Why do we still want this unreasonable fourteen days?" Many people recalled and compared housing, labor protection, and other aspects, and came to the conclusion that twelve free tickets plus fourteen days of paid leave would cause lax labor discipline. They also took the initiative to propose: "Let us persuade these comrades."

The opinions of the old workers gave the leading cadres of Jiang'an Railway Station an inspiration. They also summarized Zhen Yushan's model deeds of managing his family diligently and thriftily and building the country diligently and thriftily, and summarized the ungrateful thoughts of a worker who joined the railway in 1951, preparing to hand them over to the workers for debate together. We can imagine that the production and life experience of these old workers, and the class consciousness of these old workers, will give a great education to all employees (especially new workers).

    找到了靠山
    本报记者  曹葆铭
    只在嘴上尊敬老师傅
    据汉口江岸车站在这次整风中检查：这个以“二七”斗争著名的车站，目前只有顾老造是“二七”老工人。但是，党委书记在江岸工作两年以后才认识他，很多干部至今还不认识他。有着几十年生产经验和政治经验的顾老造，因为年纪大了，自动请求由主任扳道员改为扳道员，在评级的时候，才被评为二级。有些刚进铁路，确定职务的新工人，拿的工资就跟他一般多。车站在选拔干部和发展党组织的时候，也只强调老工人文化低，历史复杂，而看不到老工人的优点，所以老工人可以提拔的不提拔，可以吸收入党的不吸收。于是，有的青工就错误地认为：“老师傅有什么本事？要有本事，早就提拔了。”有的新工人刚和老工人订包教合同时，称老工人为“师傅”；定职后，就叫“老×”；计件工资比师傅拿的多了，便叫“老落后”。很多老工人因此情绪不高，说：“党员有党管，青年有团管，就是我们老年人谁也不管。”
    造成这种情况的原因，正像党委书记赵玉豪说的：“我们嘴上尊敬他们是‘老师傅’，但思想上并没有依靠他们。”许多干部一提起老工人，就说：“老工人么，生产上是有一手，经验多，但在政治思想上可不怎么样。”所以，有些同志往往只在生产遇到困难的时候，才找老工人商量、研究，平时很少根据老工人的生活特点和思想特点，关怀他们，照顾他们。
                      老工人也有了前途
    江岸车站党委是在遇到困难没法解决的时候，才发现这个问题的。在整风中，群众提了一千四百多条意见，处理了一千二百多条，群众还有意见。领导上摸不着底，才召集老工人座谈。老工人一共反映了八大问题，其中有批评领导对犯错误的干部没处理的，有批评干部作风的，也有批评不尊重老工人的。党委根据老工人的意见，检查和批判了不依靠老工人的思想，并采取了两项措施，认真发动老工人。
    一是合理安排老工人的工作，合理调整老工人的工资等级。如把顾老造改为一级扳道员，恢复黄东山原来的工资。提拔二十多年的调车员周邦和为值班员。这些措施，得到工人的拥护。黄东山不仅工作认真，连续六次查出有人偷窃车站的东西，并且积极参加学习，回家征求他老伴儿（党员）的意见：“你看，我从哪些方面争取入党？请你帮助我。”没有调整工资的老工人刘运国也兴高采烈，星期天也来上班，下班后就唱“东方红，太阳升”。有人说：“你疯了？”他说：“我高兴嘛！在新社会里，老人也有前途。”
    二是各级干部分头到老工人家中“登门请教，促膝谈心”。本来，马彪骏对站长刘继长很有意见。这次，刘继长去访问马彪骏，便首先检讨自己的缺点，急得马彪骏直说：“事情都过去了，这还检讨！刘站长，算了，算了。”后来，几个老工人也聚拢了，向刘继长说：“刘站长，你坐着。今天你当主席，我们给你提意见。提完了，喝酒。”大家谈得很和谐，把心里话都讲了出来。
                  有几个老工人闹过生活问题？
    在这次访问中，干部受的教育最大。原来，有的干部认为老工人思想保守，政治上不开展，但事实证明恰恰相反。老工人在对待个人与集体、个人与国家的关系上，有着高度的阶级觉悟。老工人甄玉山家里去年一连死了两个人，连治疗带安葬，欠了一百多元债。工会代表去调查，要给他补助，他不要。他说：“每个人有困难都靠公家补助，那还行？”他把吸了三十二年的纸烟戒了，每月节约六元。他又卖了皮袄，并动员爱人去挑土。他就这样一个补助没要，还清了债。刘万顺很直爽地问赵玉豪同志：“赵书记，有几个四十五岁以上的老工人向你闹过生活问题？”谈到自由与纪律的关系时，几乎每个老工人都对目前车站劳动纪律松弛的现象提出了批评。马彪骏向站长刘继长讲：“我们小组过去有‘六谈’，都是生产技术问题。现在却是‘七谈’，谈的是电影、戏剧、跳舞、手表、自行车、恋爱和计件工资。”老工人冯百川反映：“保健站不负责任，谁请假就给，一天不行给两天，三天不行给五天。小伙子一出门就举起病假单子说：‘妥了！’”老工人郑冠卿说：“我们搞工作，就要当自己家里的事来搞。”
                      江主席的作风变了
    原来，有的干部认为老工人文化低，能力弱，甚至连话也说不清楚。事实证明，老工人在大会上做报告确有困难，但他们最体会群众的思想感情，解决问题使人心悦诚服。例如，杨明伟要把破雨衣换成新的，但库房里只有旧的。他跟管理员扯皮，被顾老造碰上了。顾老造向杨明伟讲清实际困难和勤俭建国的道理后，说：“你先拿旧的去穿。我明年换了新的就先给你，换你这件旧的。你看，我现在穿的雨衣比你的还坏哩。”杨明伟当时很不好意思说：“我哪能要顾老师傅的？”换一件旧的就走了。
    顾老造兼任工会劳保委员，在群众中威信高，年轻的工会主席江忠林特地去请教他：“工会工作怎么做好？”他说：“要随时体贴工人需要，解决问题。举个例子说吧，下雨的时候，你最好叫行政提前十分钟点名上班，你就去跟大家讲讲：‘同志们，你们谁没带雨衣来？家近的就赶快回去拿，家远的我们通知家属送来。’只要这么做，大家就会感动。我们平常就是没人关心这事，有时就淋着雨干一班。还有，最近事故比较多，你应该在交接班时去现场转转，谁没有带安全带，你就当
    场纠正，并且在第二天交接班大会上提出批评，他也会满意。”当江忠林
      照着顾老造的意见去做以后，工人普遍反映：“江主席的作风变了。”
                    “让我们去说服这些同志”
    江岸车站在鸣放中，也有些工人提出过高的要求，如要求值夜班时喝排骨汤，要求发住房津贴等。其中闹得最凶的有两次：一是铁路上现时是每人每年有两张免票，有些人还不满意，要求恢复旧社会的每年十二张免票。一是车站现时有十八种奖励制度，有些人不满足，要求恢复旧社会的十四天事假折薪（每人每年可请十四天事假，不扣薪金），如不请假，可多领十四天薪金。工人刘海生还说：“这十四天是‘二七’斗争来的，被你们取消了！”当时迷惑了很多人，使有的小组辩论不下去。
    当然，车站党委很快就在“二七”斗争史上查明：当时根本没有提过十四天事假折薪的条件。但是，怎样来说服这部分工人，使他们自动取消这些过高的要求呢？党委书记赵玉豪找老工人说：“这些问题应该怎么解决？在农村，我们找叔伯大爷们商量。在企业，我们就请老师傅来出主意，想办法。”刘正元马上就批评这些提出过高要求的工人说：“他们没受过旧日的苦，也就不知今日的甜。就拿工作时间说吧，过去是两班制，一天干十二小时，现在是三班半，还有大休，好得不能说。我们应该替国家想一想，没有国家哪有自己！我们国家的建设工程一个接着一个，还长着呢。这些人就想一天长成个‘大菜苔’，那有这种事？”刘运国也谈到他过去要进铁路工作，他父亲去哀求了姓刘的段长多少次，也进不来。后来，有人告诉他父亲：“你得给段长塞钱，钱要塞在他的大烟盘子底下，把大烟盘子垫翘了起来才行。”他父亲只好借了一百块银元，把段长的大烟盘子垫得翘起来了，他才进了铁路，但头三个月一个钱也没拿到。他说：“这些人现时一入路定职，就是五十多元，跟老工人一般多，还要求这要求那，真不知足”。
    老工人们又具体分析了十二张免票和十四天事假折薪的问题。郑冠卿说：“过去一年十二张免票，哪个用完了？我一年只用一张。拿着免票到处跑，影响个人收入，也影响国家生产。”甄玉山还具体算了笔账：过去多发十四天工资，不过三四十元。一开支的时候，物价就暴涨，买不到什么东西。现时取消了这个制度，却有许多奖励制度，而且物价稳定。仅仅扳道员的安全奖，一年就有六七十元，比十四天工资多，同时对生产有很大好处。有的又补充说：“调车员拿计件工资，有的一个月挣的钱比站长的工资还多。为什么还要这不合理的十四天呢？”许多工人都从住房、劳保等各方面进行了回忆对比，并得出这样的结论：十二张免票加十四天事假，就会造成劳动纪律松懈。他们还主动提出：“让我们去说服这些同志。”
    老工人的意见给了江岸车站领导干部启示。他们又总结了甄玉山勤俭持家和勤俭建国的模范事迹，总结了1951年入路的一个工人的忘本思想，准备一齐交给工人辩论。我们可以想到：这些老工人的生产和生活经验，这些老工人的阶级觉悟，都将给全体职工（特别是新工人）很大教育。
