Beijing Builds Glass Instrument Factory

    (By Our Newspaper) Our country's first modern glass instrument factory—the Beijing Glass Factory—is under intense construction and is expected to be put into production in April of this year.

    This factory, designed with the help of East Germany, will be able to produce an average of twenty-three tons of glass per day after all equipment is put into production, including one thousand kinds of scientific and medical instruments.
