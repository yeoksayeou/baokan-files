Three Girls in Siwu Bay
—A Record of the Transformation of the Sanitary Conditions in Xinwu Bay, Huanggang, Hubei
Xinwu Bay in Song’ao Township, Huanggang County, Hubei Province, has basically eliminated mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows, making it the first “Four-No Bay” to emerge in Hubei Province.

Xinwu Bay used to be a notoriously smelly and dirty place. It was surrounded by twenty-two foul-smelling manure pits and three stinking ditches over twenty yards long, with an unbearable stench and swarms of mosquitoes and flies. The weedy areas beside the threshing ground were home to countless rats, snakes, and sparrows. People called Xinwu Bay a "buckwheat cake" (implying it was tough and undesirable).

The poor environmental hygiene in Xinwu Bay brought disaster to its people. Of the fifty people in the bay, forty-eight suffered from diseases such as malaria, diarrhea, and meningitis in 1956, and four of them died. The seventeen laborers only earned just over 20,700 work points throughout the year, with a grain shortage of more than 3,300 jin. Damage to furniture, clothing, and grain caused by rats was also a common occurrence.

Transforming Xinwu Bay into a clean "Four-No Bay" was no easy task. In July of last year, led by the activists Ni Suzhen, Fang Wenxian, and Wang Guijin, three young women, Xinwu Bay launched a sanitation campaign to eliminate the four pests. They actively cleared out stinking ditches, removed turf, and relocated manure pits. When the drought made it difficult to remove the turf, they would water it at night and then remove it the next day, never complaining even when their hands blistered and bled. However, they did not receive widespread support at the time. The commune members in the bay did not believe that mosquitoes and rats could be eliminated. They said, "Even Buddha and Guanyin couldn't do anything about rats and mosquitoes, how can you eliminate them!" Some said that sanitation work would delay production. Some commune members did not agree to give them work points for their sanitation work. When they removed turf in front of someone's house, the residents were unhappy, and some even cursed at them. They felt somewhat discouraged. The township and commune cadres encouraged them to overcome difficulties and set an example for the masses. Staff from the health department also assisted them by regularly educating the masses about how mosquitoes and flies spread diseases, and they used bottles to collect mosquito larvae from the stinking ditches. When the larvae turned into mosquitoes, they showed them to the masses and carried out drug extermination. They not only eliminated a large number of mosquitoes and flies but also accumulated more than 3,700 dan of fertilizer for the commune. The people in the bay were educated by the facts and actively participated in filling manure pits and applying yellow mud to the walls. Some even carried bricks at night to build public toilets. In a few days, there were indeed no mosquitoes in Xinwu Bay. Then, the masses in the entire bay launched a battle to kill rats, sparrows, plaster wall bases, block rat holes, and destroy rat nests, eliminating more than 200 rats, over 50 sparrows, and destroying 38 rat holes.

Xinwu Bay was transformed. The weeds, stinking ditches, and manure pits in front of the houses were replaced by threshing grounds paved with sand. The walls were plastered with yellow mud. The washing pond, drinking water pond, and livestock watering pond were all separated. The houses and kitchens of every household were cleaned and tidied up. They were no longer threatened by the four pests. Since last summer, when diseases such as malaria and diarrhea were prevalent in nearby bays, no one here has fallen ill. The seventeen laborers here earned more than 31,800 work points throughout the year, and production increased by 30% compared to 1956. People have composed a jingle to describe the changes in Xinwu Bay:

	Xinwu Bay, Xinwu Bay,
	Now it's half the sky higher;
	Stinking pits and brambles turn to threshing grounds,
	Mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows meet Yama.
	We can sun the grain without guarding,
	And sleep without mosquito nets in summer;
	Eliminating the four pests increased grain production,
	Thanks to the three good girls.

Now, the girls are cultivating chrysanthemums in the bay. They are also planning to plant various flowers and trees, such as peach and plum trees, in front of and behind the bay in the spring. To ensure that sanitation work is regularized, public health agreements have been formulated for the entire bay and for each household, and everyone is actively preventing the reappearance of rats and sparrows. Once, someone in the bay heard the sound of rats moving, and everyone in the entire bay immediately mobilized to search for the rats, finally discovering a missed rat hole, which they immediately blocked.

In the past, many people were unwilling to come to this bay. Last summer, people from nearby bays even came here to cool off and sleep. Now, the nearby Red Flag Sixth and Seventh Communes have formulated plans to eliminate the four pests, striving to become "Four-No Communes" this year, and the entire township is striving to become a "Four-No Township" next year.

    四无湾里三姑娘
    ——记湖北黄冈新屋湾卫生面貌的改变
    湖北黄冈县宋坳乡新屋湾已经基本上消灭了蚊蝇鼠雀，这是湖北省出现的第一个四无湾。
    新屋湾在过去原是一个有名的又臭又脏的湾子。它被二十二个臭粪坑和三条二十多丈长的臭水沟包围着，真是臭气熏人，蚊蝇扑脸。稻场边的杂草丛里，藏着无数的老鼠、蛇兽和麻雀等。人们称新屋湾是“荞麦粑”。
    新屋湾的环境卫生很坏，给这里的人们带来了灾难。全湾五十人，1956年害疟疾、泻肚、脑膜炎等疾病的就有四十八人，其中四人死亡；十七个劳动力全年只做了二万零七百多个工分，欠口粮三千三百多斤。老鼠咬坏家具、衣服、损害粮食等更是经常的现象。
    使新屋湾变成干干净净的四无湾，真是一件不容易的事情。去年7月间，在积极分子倪素珍、方文先和王桂金三位姑娘带动下，新屋湾开展了除四害的卫生运动。她们积极地清臭沟、铲草皮、移粪坑，天旱草皮铲不动，她们就晚上泼水第二天铲，手起泡出血都不叫苦。可是，她们当时没有得到大家的支持。湾里的社员都不相信能消灭蚊子、老鼠。他们说：“佛爷、观音都对老鼠、蚊子没办法，你们那能消灭掉它们！”有的说：搞卫生工作耽误生产。她们搞卫生工作，有些社员不同意给她们记工分。她们铲草铲到谁家门口，谁都不高兴，有的还骂人。她们有些泄气，乡社干部便鼓励她们克服困难，做出样子给群众看。卫生部门派出的工作人员也协助她们经常把蚊蝇传染疾病的情况向群众宣传，并且用瓶子把臭水沟里的孑孓装起来，等它们变成蚊子时，拿给群众看，同时进行药物扑杀。他们不仅消灭了大量的蚊蝇，还为社里积肥三千七百多担。湾里的人受到了事实的教育，也都积极参加填粪坑、往墙上刷黄泥等工作，有的还连夜挑砖修盖公共厕所。不几天，新屋湾果真没有蚊虫了。接着，全湾群众又投入了杀老鼠、打麻雀、糊墙根、堵鼠洞、毁鼠窝的战斗，共消灭了老鼠二百多只，麻雀五十多只，捣毁鼠洞三十八个。
    新屋湾变样了，门前的杂草、臭沟和粪坑变成了用沙铺起来的稻场，墙上刷了黄泥，洗衣塘、饮水塘和牲畜饮水塘都分开了。家家户户的屋子、厨房也都收拾打扫得干干净净。他们再不受四害的威胁了。去年夏季以来，附近湾子流行疟疾、泻肚等疾病，而这里没有人害病。这里十七个劳动力全年做了三万一千八百多个工分，生产比1956年提高30％。人们把新屋湾的变化编成了一首顺口溜：
    新屋湾，新屋湾，
    如今高了半边天；
    臭坑、刺扒变稻场，
    蚊、蝇、鼠、雀见阎王。
    放心晒粮人不守，
    夏天睡觉不用帐；
    除了四害增了粮，
    亏得三个好姑娘。
    现在，姑娘们正在湾里培育菊花。她们还准备开春时在湾前湾后栽上各种花草，种上桃树和李树。为了使卫生工作经常化，从全湾到每户都制订了公共卫生公约，人人都积极防止新出现的鼠雀。有一次，湾里有人听见老鼠跳动的声音，全湾的人马上动员起来搜索老鼠，终于发现了一个漏掉的鼠洞，随即把它堵塞住。
    过去很多人不愿来这个湾子，去年夏季，附近湾子的人还来这里乘凉、睡觉。现在，附近的红旗六社、七社都制订了消灭四害的规划，争取在今年成为四无社，全乡争取明年成为四无乡。
