Reflections on an Untitled Subject
    Zhong Huai
    A certain senior intellectual said: "In the old society, I did not feel undemocratic, and in the new society, I did not feel democratic. After rectification, I have now personally seen the benefits of socialist democracy."
    Hearing this, we must first congratulate the achievements of the rectification of this organization, and second, congratulate this senior intellectual on the improvement of his socialist consciousness.
    In addition, there is also a little feeling. The reason why this senior intellectual "did not feel democratic in the new society" is probably precisely because he "did not feel undemocratic in the old society."
    Aren't those who clamor that the new society is not free (for example, no freedom to publish reactionary remarks, no freedom for grain speculation and usury, no freedom to arbitrarily exploit workers) precisely those who "did not feel unfree in the old society"?
    "There is only concrete freedom and concrete democracy in the world, and there is no abstract freedom and abstract democracy." This truth has been confirmed once again here.
    Workers in a factory in Shenyang made suggestions to the cafeteria, criticizing the food as being too expensive. The mess hall manager was very dissatisfied and said, "If you think it's expensive, I'll sell it cheaply." Now the price of food has been reduced, but it is losing money.
    Some staff members of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry suggested setting up a trash can in the family dormitory on Fuxing West Road. The director of the office asked in reply: Why don't you strengthen your labor viewpoint? He also made a counter-proposal, saying that the garbage could be sent to his dormitory in the Taixing Building to be dumped. It is five or six li from Fuxing West Road to Taixing Building.
    These two small matters reveal the news that the rectification of some units and some departments has not improved.
    In these units and these departments, what needs to be rectified first is the leaders' attitude towards rectification. Isn't this a very clear thing?

    无题有感

    某位高级知识分子说：“我在旧社会没有感到不民主，在新社会没有感到民主。经过整改，现在我才亲眼看到社会主义民主的好处了。”
    听到这话，我们一要祝贺这个机关整改的成就，二要祝贺这位高级知识分子社会主义觉悟的提高。
    此外，也有一点感想。这位高级知识分子所以“在新社会没有感到民主”，怕正是因为“在旧社会没有感到不民主”吧。
    那些叫嚷新社会不自由（比方没有发表反动言论的自由，没有粮食投机和高利贷的自由，没有任意剥削工人的自由）的人们，不也正是“在旧社会没有感到不自由”的人么？
    “世界上只有具体的自由，具体的民主，没有抽象的自由，抽象的民主。”这个真理在这里又一次得到了印证。
    沈阳某厂工人对食堂提出意见，批评菜饭卖得贵了。伙食管理员很不满意，说：“你们嫌贵我就贱卖。”现在菜价是降低了，但却是赔本的。
    建筑材料工业部上海办事处有些工作人员建议，在复兴西路的家属宿舍设个垃圾箱。办事处主任反问道：你们为什么不加强劳动观点？并提出反建议说，可以把垃圾送到他的宿舍泰兴大楼去倒。从复兴西路到泰兴大楼，有五、六里路。
    这两件小事透露了某些单位、某些部门整改没有起色的消息。
    在这些单位、这些部门，首先需要整改的就是领导者对待整改的态度。这不是很清楚的事么？
