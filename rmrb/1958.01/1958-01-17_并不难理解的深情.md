Title: A Deep Affection That Is Not Difficult to Understand

The Party calls on people to be ambitious and to muster socialist drive to go to the mountains to build them up.

And so, people have set off to the mountains one after another, including senior leading comrades like Fang Zichun, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, who is advanced in years. A reporter from Xinhua News Agency wrote a report entitled "Fang Zichun Returns to Damao Mountain," which was published in the People's Daily on December 18th of last year, along with two photographs. Many people were deeply moved after reading it. However, some people found it difficult to understand. One young comrade, after reading it, said, "He's so old, still leaning on a cane, what's he doing going to the mountains? It's really strange." He saw the peasants surrounding Comrade Fang Zichun and appearing so affectionate, and he also didn't understand why the mountain area farmers were so sentimental, with the old farmer who had saved Comrade Fang Zhimin's wife traveling twenty *li* to visit, bringing a basket of eggs.

I can understand this young comrade. The reason he can't understand these issues is, besides problems with his ideological awareness, also because he is too young. Therefore, he cannot understand the close, flesh-and-blood relationship between our Party and the people of the mountainous areas; nor does he understand the significant importance of building up the mountainous areas for the construction of our socialist motherland. He may also respond to the call and go to the mountains, but at most it would only be for his own personal "labor training" (which is of course also important), lacking a more far-reaching ideal.

I am also still a bit young, and therefore, I don't know much about the earliest days when our Party established mountain base areas. However, I personally experienced and witnessed the events of the Anti-Japanese War.

I remember those difficult years when the people of the mountainous areas, for the survival and prosperity of the nation, for their own liberation and a happy future, together with our Party comrades, faced life and death, sharing joys and sorrows, braving ice and snow, and at the risk of their lives and property, persisted in the struggle in the mountains during the brutal mopping-up campaigns of the Japanese invaders. Some shed their blood in the fight against the enemy; others, in order to protect the lives of the majority (including cadres), personally strangled their crying, ignorant children in mountain caves; some suffered the enemy's cruel torture and became disabled for life... Like this, like this, they persisted with our Party until victory. There was indeed an inseparable, flesh-and-blood connection between us, and our nation was reborn from this connection. Then we jointly traversed the years of the Liberation War.

The revolution was victorious, and the situation greatly developed. Older comrades were gradually withdrawn from the mountainous areas, from the deep mountains to the plains, from the countryside to the cities. The people of the mountain base areas were so reluctant to part with them, with so many words of farewell. However, victory was what we had sought with our lives, and the great development of the situation was what we had always longed for. For a time, all of these things came together, and how could they not, with excited hearts, send their good sons and daughters, their closest friends, and their leaders to welcome victory?

However, at the same time, they also have such deep remembrance and ardent anticipation: Is he working well? How is his health? Is the task too heavy? All kinds of remembrance, all kinds of considerations, are waiting for answers at all times.

I read a letter written by five young comrades in Chengde County, Hebei Province. The letter said:

"The people of the mountainous areas deeply miss the old comrades who stayed with them in the past. When they are mentioned, their eyes fill with tears, and they fall silent. When a few of us comrades went to the top of Fushan Township (old base area) in Chengde County to understand the rural situation, we visited a few families who had persisted in the mountain struggle. They were very warm to us when they saw us. It seemed as if they had seen relatives they had been separated from for many years. An old man, Li Shuang, who had persisted in the mountain struggle for many years and now suffers from hemiplegia, took out a photo yellowed by smoke, a group photo of several people, and introduced us: This is Li Yunchang (former Commander of the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Border Region), this is Yang Yumin (former Deputy Governor of Rehe Province), this is Yan Guhang (former Deputy Governor of Rehe Province), this is Wang Yufeng (former County Magistrate of Chengde). While introducing them, the old man muttered sadly, 'I don't know where they all are now? After they left, they didn't even send a letter, they've forgotten all about us. I miss them so much!' Then the old man inquired about the whereabouts of Comrade Zhang Zhenjiu, the secretary of the district committee who was with him during the Anti-Japanese War. When some comrades who had sacrificed themselves in the struggle were mentioned, the old man lowered his head and remained silent. When we were about to leave, Liu Changming, an old Party member who had once sent forty-seven letters from the mountain for us in one night, tightly grabbed our hands, looked at our faces, his eyes filled with tears, and couldn't say a word, as if there were many things in his heart that he couldn't say to a confidant. This meaningful expression left an imprint in our minds."

No one can fail to be moved by this deep remembrance. However, I think this is far more than just nostalgia, but rather a longing for a happier future. Although after liberation, the Party and the state gave the people of the old mountain base areas all kinds of care and attention, and also did their best to give importance to mountain construction, enabling the mountain areas to enter the socialist realm along with the entire motherland, the current mountain areas are, after all, still economically and culturally backward mountain areas. The people of the mountainous areas want to build and develop, but how to build an economically and culturally advanced, prosperous, and happy mountainous area? The people of the mountainous areas are eager to discuss this major issue with the old comrades who originally lived in the mountainous areas. They are asking: When will you come? What ideas and plans do you have for building up the mountainous areas? Think about it, is there anything difficult to understand about such deep affection? Is there anything difficult to understand about the old comrades who are so concerned about the construction of the mountainous areas going up the mountains with canes?

The Party has concentrated the will of the people of the mountainous areas, and sees higher and further than they do. The Party not only sees that organizing cadres to go to the mountains to assist the people of the mountainous areas in building an economically and culturally advanced, prosperous, and happy mountainous area is to satisfy the ardent wishes of the people of the mountainous areas and is the most fundamental measure for the Party to maintain flesh-and-blood ties with the people of the mountainous areas; it also sees that this is necessary for the socialist construction of our entire motherland: the socialist construction of the whole country cannot be separated from the mountainous areas; the great improvement of the living standards of the people throughout the country also depends on the construction and prosperity of the mountainous areas. Therefore, the Party issued a strong call.

Those who bravely go to the mountains will be great heroes in the socialist construction of the motherland. Moreover, those who are welcomed by the people of the mountainous areas are by no means limited to old comrades. Didn't that old farmer on the top of Fushan Township regard the five young comrades as "long-separated relatives"? Whoever goes to the mountains will deeply understand this point.

    并不难理解的深情
    贾恭
    党号召人们，要有志气，要鼓起社会主义干劲来，上山去建设山区。
    于是，人们纷纷动身上山去了，其中包括像党的江西省委书记方志纯那样年老的高级领导同志。新华社的记者写过一篇报道，题目叫作“方志纯再上大茅山”，登在去年12月18日人民日报上，还登有两张图片。许多人读后很受感动。然而也有人觉得这难以理解。一个青年同志看后就说：“这么大年岁了，还扶着手杖，到山上去干什么？真奇怪。”他看到农民们围绕着方志纯同志显得那样亲热，而且那个救过方志敏同志爱人的老农民，还提了一筐鸡蛋，赶二十里路来看望，也不懂山区的农民为什么如此多情。
    我倒能理解这位青年同志。他之所以不能理解这些问题，除了思想意识上的毛病以外，还由于他太年轻，因此，他不能理解我们党同山区人民之间的亲如骨肉的关系；也不理解建设山区在建设社会主义祖国上的重大意义。他也可能会响应号召上山去的，但他最多也不过是为了自己个人的“劳动锻炼”（这当然也很重要），而缺乏更为远大的理想的。
    我也还是年轻了一些，因此，不大知道我们党最早开创山区根据地时的情景，然而，抗日战争时期的事，我是曾经亲历和目睹过的。
    我记起了那些艰难的岁月，山区人民为了民族的生存和兴旺，为了自己的解放和幸福的未来，同我们党的同志一起，出生入死，同甘共苦，爬冰卧雪，在日寇残酷的扫荡中，不惜身家性命，坚持着山林里的斗争。他们，有的在同敌人的搏斗中流尽了血；有的为了掩救多数人的生命（其中有干部），在山洞里亲手掐死那嚎啼着的无知的儿女；有的受尽敌人的酷刑，终身残疾；……这样的，这样的，一直同我们的党坚持到胜利。这之间的确是生死不可分离的血肉的联系，我们的民族也就从这种联系中新生。接着我们又共同跨越了解放战争的年代。
    革命胜利了，形势大发展，老些的同志，逐步从山区抽走，由深山而平原，由农村而城市。山区根据地的人民，是那样千言万语地不忍与之离别。然而，胜利是我们生死以求的，形势的大发展是我们一直渴望的。一时，这些都一齐涌来了，他们又怎会不怀着激动的心情，把自己的这些好儿女、至友、领导者送去迎接胜利。
    然而，他们又同时有着多么深沉的怀念和热烈的盼望啊：他工作得好吗？身体怎么样？任务过于繁重吗？种种怀念，种种思虑，是无时无刻不在等待着回答的。
    我读到过河北省承德县五个青年同志写的一封信。信上说：
    “山区人民非常怀念过去和他们在一起呆过的老同志，提起来他们就眼含热泪，默不作声。我们几个同志到承德县富山乡（老根据地）山顶去了解农村情况时，访问了几户坚持山地斗争的人家，他们见到我们非常亲热。看来就好像是见到了离别多年的亲人。一个坚持山地多年，现在患着半身不遂的老人李爽，拿出一张被烟熏黄了的几个人合影的照片，向我们介绍：这是李运昌（原冀热辽边区司令），这是杨雨民（原热河省副省长），这是阎顾行（原热河省副省长），这是王毓峰（原承德县长）。老人一边介绍着，一边难过地嘀咕着：‘他们这会儿也不知都哪去了？走后连个信都没有，把我们都忘了。想他们哪！’接着老人又向我们打听抗日时期和他在一起的区委书记张振九同志在什么地方。当提到一些在斗争中牺牲了的同志时，老人就低下了头默默不语了。当我们和他们临别时，一位一宿曾从山上给我们送出过四十七封信的老党员刘长明同志，紧紧地揪住我们的手，望着我们的脸，眼泪湿润着他的眼睛，一句话也没说出来，看意思好像有许多心里话，无处向知心人去说。这种意味深长的神情，在我们脑海里留下了烙印。”
    谁也不能不为这深切的怀念所感动。然而我觉得，这远不止于怀旧，而是怀着更深刻的对于未来幸福生活的想望。尽管在解放后，党和国家给了山区老根据地人民种种关怀和照顾，也尽力给了山区建设以重视，使山区随同整个祖国跨进了社会主义境界。但是，现在的山区，毕竟还是经济上、文化上落后的山区，山区的人民要建设，要发展，可是怎样建设一个经济上、文化上进步、繁荣、幸福的山区呢？山区人民，是急切地想同原来在山区居住过的老同志们一起商量这件大事的。他们在问：你们何时来？你们有些什么样建设山区的想法和打算？想想看，这样深情厚谊有什么难以理解？对于山区建设关心至切的老同志策杖上山又有什么难以理解呢？
    党集中了山区人民的意志，而又比他们看得更高更远。党不仅看到，组织干部上山，协助山区人民建设一个经济上、文化上进步、繁荣、幸福的山区，是满足了山区人民的热望，是党同山区人民保持血肉联系的最根本措施；也看到这样作是我们整个祖国的社会主义建设所必需的：全国的社会主义建设，离不开山区；全国人民生活的大改善，也还依赖于山区的建设和繁荣。于是党发出了强有力的号召。
    勇于上山去的，将是祖国社会主义建设中的大勇士。而且山区人民所欢迎的，绝不止于老同志，富山乡山顶上的那位老农民，不是把五个年青的同志看得也像“久别的亲人”那样吗？谁到山里去，谁就会深刻地理解这一点的。
