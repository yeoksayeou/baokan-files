Tears
Zhang Xiaolou

In this world, who has an unbreakable bond with tears? You might say it's children, women, or poets. Indeed, children often lack self-control, some women are soft-hearted, and poets are generally rich in emotions. Thus, in times of sadness, joy, or being moved by events and people, they often can't help but shed tears. "Life is full of emotion, and tears wet the breast," as poet Du Fu aptly put it, expressing this common human sentiment.

However, I say that everyone, anyone, even the most stony-hearted, even the most cold-blooded person, as long as their eyes are healthy, has tears at all times.

Don't believe it? Try looking at yourself in the mirror, or gaze at someone else's eyes, and you will discover the secret.

It turns out that in human eyes, there are two lacrimal glands that secrete tears, located in the upper outer corner of each eye. There are also four lacrimal puncta that drain tears, distributed on the edges of the upper and lower eyelids at the inner corner of each eye, connecting to two lacrimal ducts that lead to the nasal cavity. Normally, to moisten the eyeballs and to cleanse away foreign dust, a small amount of tears is secreted from the lacrimal glands almost all the time. Through the action of blinking, these tears spread across the entire eye, then enter the lacrimal puncta, pass through the lacrimal ducts, and evaporate from the nasal cavity. Because the tears don't flow onto the face, people mistakenly think that they are not shedding tears. When the lacrimal ducts are blocked (for example, during a cold, the flu, or when the nose is congested), the tears can only drip from the corners of the eyes, and people then realize that they are indeed shedding tears.

What is "tears and snot flowing together"? That's because of crying. When crying, tears gush forth like a spring, flooding the lacrimal ducts and overflowing from the corners of the eyes. The tears flooding the lacrimal ducts cannot be entirely evaporated by the nasal cavity, so they flow out of the nostrils, which people mistakenly think is snot. In reality, it's just tears taking a different route.

Why do people "shed tears in the wind"? It's not due to sentimentality, but because the eyes are stimulated by the wind. Especially in winter, when the cold wind blows, tear production increases. If your lacrimal ducts are not very clear, you will have to shed some tears.

In fact, the eyes shed tears in more situations than just when facing the wind. In smoky environments, when dust is flying, or when sandstorms fill the sky, a lot of tears will be shed. This is because as soon as there is external stimulation, the central nervous system immediately reacts, causing the eyelid muscles to contract, rapidly closing the eyelids to prevent external force impacts. At the same time, it promotes lacrimal gland secretion, causing a large amount of tears to wash away foreign objects that have already entered the eyes. In addition, the surface of the eyeballs is densely covered with a network of sensory nerve endings. Upon receiving any slight external stimulation, the eyeballs will ache or itch, alerting people to the situation. It can be seen that tears are one of the important defense lines for protecting the eyes.

Under normal circumstances, each person secretes about one to two milliliters (C.C.) of tears per day. Young people, especially girls, may secrete more, which is why the "beautiful woman" in the eyes of a lover often opens her "pair of watery eyes," appearing particularly charming and moving.

    泪
    张晓楼
    在人间，谁同眼泪结下了不解之缘？你也许会说，是孩子，是妇女，是诗人。的确，孩子一般是因为缺乏克制能力，妇女有些是因为心肠软，诗人大都是因为感情丰富，于是在悲伤、喜欢、感时感事感人的时候，常常会忍不住淌下泪来。“人生有情泪沾臆”，诗人杜甫这句诗道出了人的这种常情。
    但是，我要说，人人，任何人，即使是铁石心肠的硬汉子，甚至是冷酷无情的人，只要眼睛没有毛病，是时时都有着眼泪的。
    不信吗？你试对镜自照，或者面对面注视一下别人的眼睛，你就会发现秘密了。
    原来，在人的眼睛里，有两个分泌眼泪的泪腺，位在两眼的外上角；又有四条疏导眼泪的泪小点，分布在两眼内角的上下眼皮边缘，接连着二条泪道，通到鼻腔。平日，为了润湿眼球，也为了清洗外来灰尘，几乎随时随地都有少量的眼泪从泪腺分泌出来，通过眨眼的动作，布满全眼，然后进入泪小点，通过泪道，由鼻腔蒸发出去。因为眼泪不流到脸上，人们才发生错觉，以为没有流泪。当泪道被阻塞的时候（例如伤风、感冒、鼻子不通气时），眼泪只得从眼角滴下来，这时人们才确切地感到在流泪了。
    “泪涕交流”是怎么回事呢？那是因为哭了。哭的时候，泪如泉涌，大量拥进泪道还不够，还要大量从眼角溢出来。拥进泪道的眼泪，鼻腔不及蒸发，只得由它从鼻孔流出，人们才误认为是鼻涕，其实就是眼泪，出路不同而已。
    “迎风洒泪”又是为什么呢？那并非是由于多情，而是由于眼睛受到风的刺激。特别在冬天，冷风一吹，泪液就增多。如果你的泪道不很通畅，就不得不洒泪一番了。
    其实眼睛何止迎风才洒泪。在烟雾迷漫、在灰尘飞扬、在风沙满天的时候，都会大量洒泪。这是因为一有外来刺激，中枢神经系统立刻有反应，就一方面引起眼皮肌肉的收缩，叫眼皮迅速闭上，阻止外力打击；一方面促进泪腺分泌，叫大量眼泪冲走已经进入眼睛的异物。同时，眼珠的表面密密地分布着感觉神经末梢网，一受到外界任何细微的刺激，眼珠就会发痛发痒，唤起人的注意。可见，眼泪是保护眼睛的几条重要防线中的一条。
    在正常的情况下，每人每天分泌的泪水，大约一到二毫升（C．C．）。青年，尤其是姑娘们，可能分泌较多，所以情人眼里的“秋水伊人”，常常睁开“一双水汪汪的眼睛”，显得格外妩媚动人了。
