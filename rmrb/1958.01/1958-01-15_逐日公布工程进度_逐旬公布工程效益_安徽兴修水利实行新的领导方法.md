Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, January 13th: Anhui Province is implementing a new leadership method in the farmland water conservancy construction movement: publishing the progress chart of construction in various locations in the newspaper every day, and publishing the engineering benefits chart every ten days. Because this chart can help leaders grasp the situation and guide the movement in a timely manner, and also enable various regions to catch up with advanced regions, people call this chart the "promotion chart." Facts have proven that this approach is a very good leadership method.

Last November, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to publish the progress of water conservancy construction in each special district in the "Anhui Daily" every day. Subsequently, the newspapers of local committees and county committees, as well as some district and township bulletins, have also imitated this practice. After implementing this method, a competition automatically formed between special districts, counties, and townships. No one wanted to be at the bottom of the list, which powerfully promoted the farmland water conservancy construction movement. In the farmland water conservancy construction progress chart published by the Bengbu Prefectural Committee's "Fuxiao Daily," Quanjiao County was initially ranked second to last. The County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of this county immediately held a telephone conference overnight, adopted measures, organized and mobilized the masses to carry out all-out construction, and worked day and night. As a result, it quickly jumped to the first place in the entire region, and has been running ahead of all counties ever since. Daxing Township in Cuozhen District, Feidong County, was originally the most backward township in the district in terms of water conservancy construction. Since the district committee notified the construction progress of each township, all cadres in Daxing Township were determined to lead the masses to carry out intensive construction. As a result, it also jumped to become the best township in the entire district.

From the daily farmland water conservancy construction progress chart, one can see the overall task completion situation in the province, the amount of earthwork completed in a day, as well as the labor attendance rate and labor efficiency. From the engineering benefits chart every ten days, one can see the development of various engineering projects and the engineering benefits. This enables leaders at all levels to keep abreast of the water conservancy construction work at all times, and to discover and solve problems at any time. For example, when the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party saw from the progress chart that the work efficiency of Huaiyuan County was very high, it sent an inspection team to check. As a result, it was found that the reason for the high work efficiency was mainly due to the large number of small ditches dug, which only involved taking soil and not carrying it. Therefore, the average amount of earthwork done per person per day exceeded the general standard. After discovering this problem, based on the situation, some of the small ditches were changed to medium ditches to expand the benefits. Recently, the Provincial Committee saw from the progress chart that the labor force participating in water conservancy construction in the province still accounted for about 70% of the total labor force. After the province completed the task of eight hundred million cubic meters of earthwork, the newly added eight hundred million cubic meters of earthwork has already completed more than five hundred million. It was decided to control the labor force for water conservancy construction at about 50% of the total labor force, and transfer the reduced people to other winter production activities such as accumulating fertilizer, afforestation, field management, and sideline occupations.

At present, it has become a habit for leading departments at all levels in Anhui Province to report the progress of farmland water conservancy construction every day and the benefits every ten days, and there has never been any interruption.

### 逐日公布工程进度　逐旬公布工程效益  安徽兴修水利实行新的领导方法

    逐日公布工程进度　逐旬公布工程效益
    安徽兴修水利实行新的领导方法
    新华社合肥13日电　安徽省在兴修农田水利运动中，每天在报纸上公布各地的兴修进度表，每旬又公布工程效益表。因为这种表既能帮助领导及时掌握情况、指导运动，又能使各地向先进地区奋起直追，所以人们都称这种表是“促进表”。事实证明这种做法是一个很好的领导方法。
    去年11月，中共安徽省委便决定把各专区兴修水利的进度每天都在“安徽日报”上公布，接着各地委、县委的报纸以及有些区、乡的快报，也已仿效执行。实行这个办法后，专区与专区、县与县、乡与乡之间，即自动形成了竞赛，谁都不愿在表上名列末后，这就有力地推动了兴修水利运动。蚌埠地委的“拂晓报”公布的农田水利兴修进度表上，全椒县开始是名列倒数第二。这个县的中共县委会就连夜召开电话会议，采取措施，组织和发动群众全力兴修，日夜突击，结果很快就跃居全区第一，一直到现在还跑在各县前面。肥东县撮镇区的大兴乡，原来是全区兴修水利最落后的一个乡。自从区委通报了各乡的兴修进度后，大兴乡所有干部都下定决心，领导群众突击兴修，结果也一跃而为全区最好的乡。
    从每日的农田水利兴修进度表上，可以看出全省的任务完成情况，一天所作土方的数量以及劳动力出勤率和劳动效率；从每旬的工程效益表上又能看出各种工程项目的发展情况和工程效益。这就使各级领导对水利兴修工作时时保持心中有数，随时发现问题随时解决。如中共安徽省委从进度表上看到怀远县的工效很高，便派出检查组去检查，结果发现工效高的原因主要是挖小沟多，只取土，不用挑，因此每人每天平均所做土方数超过一般的标准。发现这一问题后，便根据情况，把一部分小沟改挖成中沟，以扩大效益。最近省委从进度表上看出全省参加兴修水利的劳动力仍占全部劳力的70％左右，而全省完成八亿土方任务后，新增加的八亿土方又已完成了五亿多，就决定把兴修水利的劳力控制在全部劳力的50％左右，减下来的人转入积肥、绿化、田间管理、副业等其他冬季生产活动。
    目前安徽省各级领导部门天天报兴修农田水利的进度、旬旬报效益已形成习惯，从来没有间断过。
