(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In some areas of Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland in Britain, unemployment has recently increased significantly, approaching the level of massive unemployment before the war.

The leader of the Cardiff local branch of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, Thor Lloyd, said that in West Wales alone, there are now 8,500 unemployed people. Lloyd believes that the government's measures to restrict basic construction have largely contributed to the increase in unemployment. On January 20th, seven hundred metallurgical workers at the Morriston factory near Swansea in Wales received temporary layoff notices.

At the same time, the lives of British workers who are employed are also constantly deteriorating. Their wages are already difficult to maintain the rising cost of living.

It is reported that eight million workers in Britain have demanded wage increases and shorter working hours, which exceeds one-third of Britain's total employment. At present, the number of people demanding wage increases is still increasing.

According to materials published by the British Inland Revenue, there were forty-five millionaires in Britain with incomes of over £100,000 in the 1956-1957 fiscal year, an increase of five from the previous year.

The number of big capitalists with net incomes of over £6,000 also increased from two hundred in the 1955-1956 fiscal year to six hundred in the 1956-1957 fiscal year.

While the incomes of big capitalists who have become rich through exploitation are increasing, the average wage of British industrial workers, who are the creators of wealth, remains at the level of £600 per year.

    失业和贫困威胁着英国工人
    富翁和大资本家的数目越来越多
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在英国的威尔士、苏格兰和北爱尔兰的一些地区里，最近失业人数大为增加，接近战前大批失业的水平。
    混合机械制造工会的加的夫地方分会领导人托耳·劳埃德说，仅在西威尔士，现在失业人数就有八千五百人。劳埃德认为，政府限制基本建设的措施在很大程度上促成了失业的增加。20日，在威尔士的斯温西地方附近的摩里斯顿工厂有七百个冶金工人接到临时解雇的通知。
    同时，英国在业工人的生活也在不断恶化。他们的工资已经难以维持日益增长的生活水平。
    据报道，英国已经有八百万工人提出增加工资和缩减工作时间的要求，这超过了英国全部就业人数的三分之一。目前，要求增加工资的人数还在增加着。
    据英国国内税收局公布的材料，英国在1956—1957财政年度里收入在十万英镑以上的富翁有四十五人，比前一年度增加了五人。
    净收入在六千英镑以上的大资本家也由1955—1956财政年度的二百人增加到1956—1957财政年度的六百人。
    在靠剥削致富的大资本家收入增加的同时，财富的创造者——英国产业工人的平均工资仍然停留在每年六百英镑的水平上。
