Xinhua News Agency, 21st: According to Japan's "Mainichi Shimbun," based on the long-term research of Japanese scientist Atsushi Watanabe and others, blue-green algae, a type of lower algae belonging to the same microspore algae family as chlorella (which can be used as food), holds great promise as a biological nitrogen fertilizer to replace ammonium sulfate. According to recent five-year field trials, rice paddies fertilized with this algae have shown improved soil fertility, with an average annual harvest increase of 20%. Production costs can be greatly reduced.

Atsushi Watanabe is a professor at the Institute of Applied Microbiology at the University of Tokyo. He has been conducting research on this issue in collaboration with the Agricultural Promotion Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and other organizations for sixteen years.

Watanabe says that microspore algae are a type of lower algae, a biological organism close to bacteria. There are as many as 40,000 species, the main types being red algae, green algae (of which chlorella is one), blue-green algae, diatoms, etc.

Like chlorella, blue-green algae have a very strong reproductive capacity. As long as there is light, a suitable temperature (32 degrees Celsius), and carbon dioxide, it will multiply rapidly within a few days. Japanese scientists have developed several artificial cultivation methods. One method is to use an "electric light irradiation culture tank" for cultivation. During cultivation, the culture tank is rotated while being illuminated by electric lights, and carbon dioxide is injected using an air compressor. If a single blue-green algae cell is placed in this tank, 500 cubic centimeters of blue-green algae can be produced in ten days. In addition, natural gas and warm water can also be used for cultivation. For example, if a piece of blue-green algae is placed in an ethylene tube, 180 cubic centimeters of blue-green algae can be produced in a day. Recently, it was discovered that separating natural gas from underground springs using a culture tank, and using the separated biogas with warm water, allows for mass cultivation. This method is most suitable for mass production in the future.

In 1941, Watanabe read an article published by an Indian scholar mentioning that Indian rice paddies produce a type of blue-green algae called "Anabaena," which allows for rice harvests without fertilization. He was greatly inspired and began his research on blue-green algae. He collected approximately 800 species of blue-green algae from Burma, Thailand, Borneo, Sumatra, Hainan Island, Taiwan, and other places. Among these blue-green algae, he discovered that 13 species absorb nitrogen from the air and multiply. A type of blue-green algae called Small Branching Algae, produced in Borneo, has a particularly strong ability to absorb nitrogen. After absorbing nitrogen from the air, they produce ammonia, which becomes fertilizer for rice.

In recent years, fertilizer experiments have been conducted in fields in eleven locations in Japan. Because the blue-green algae initially transplanted into the paddy fields are not easily fully decomposed and absorbed immediately, the increase in rice production is generally particularly significant in the second and third years. When fertilizing, approximately 5 kilograms of blue-green algae are required per "fan bu" (approximately 991 square meters) of paddy field. As a result, rice production increased by 2.7% in the first year, 8.4% in the second year, 19.1% in the third year, and 21.8% in the fourth year.

### 蓝藻可作水稻肥料  日本农田进行试验增产五分之一  渡边笃等已找到大量培养的方法

    蓝藻可作水稻肥料
    日本农田进行试验增产五分之一
    渡边笃等已找到大量培养的方法
    新华社21日讯　据日本“每日新闻”报道，根据日本科学家渡边笃等长期研究的结果，与可作粮食的小球藻同属于微孢藻类的一种低级藻类——蓝藻，很有希望用来代替硫酸铵，当作生物氮肥使用。根据最近五年间的实地试验，水稻田在施用这种肥料后，土质变得肥沃，平均每年收获量可增加20％。生产成本可以大大减低。
    渡边笃是东京大学应用微生物研究所的教授，他同日本农林省振兴局等机关合作连续对这一问题进行了十六年的研究。
    渡边笃说，微孢藻是一种属于最下等的藻类，是一种接近于细菌的生物。它有四万种之多，主要的种类有红藻、绿藻（小球藻是其中的一种）、蓝藻、矽藻等。
    蓝藻同小球藻一样，有极强繁殖力。只要有光、适当的温度（摄氏三十二度）和二氧化碳，它就会在几天之内大量繁殖。日本科学家已研究出几种人工培养方法。其中一种方法是利用“电灯照射式培养槽”来进行培养。培养时一边用电灯光照射，一边使培养槽旋转，用压气机送入二氧化碳。只要把一个蓝藻细胞放进这种槽里去，过了十天，就可以制造出五百公分蓝藻。此外，也可利用天然气和温水来培养。例如，把一片蓝藻放进乙烯管里去，一天就可以生产出一百八十公分蓝藻。最近发现，用培养槽把从地下喷出来的天然气加以分离，运用分离出来的沼气加上温水，就可以进行大量培养。这种方法最适宜于今后进行大量生产时采用。
    1941年，渡边笃曾读到印度一位学者所发表的一篇文章，谈到印度的水田会产生一种名叫“阿那倍那”的蓝藻，因之不用施肥就可收获水稻。那时他得到很大启发并且开始了蓝藻的研究。他从缅甸、泰国、婆罗洲、苏门答腊、海南岛、台湾等地搜集了约八百种蓝藻。从这些蓝藻中发现其中有十三种是摄取空气中的氮而繁殖起来的。婆罗洲出产的名叫小单歧藻的一种蓝藻摄取氮气的能力特别强。它们从空气中摄取氮气后就制造出氨，变成水稻的肥料。
    最近几年，在日本十一个地方的田地中进行了施肥试验。由于初移植到水田的蓝藻不易立刻被充分分解和吸收，水稻增产一般在第二、三年后才特别显著。施肥时，每一反步（约等于九百九十一平方公尺）水田约需施用蓝藻五公斤。结果，第一年水稻可增产2.7％，第二年8.4％，第三年19.1％，第四年则达21.8％。
