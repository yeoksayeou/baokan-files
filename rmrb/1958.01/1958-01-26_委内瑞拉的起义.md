The uprising in Venezuela
    Venezuela, after three weeks of armed uprising and a powerful mass movement, has overthrown the Jiménez tyranny, which consistently served the interests of American monopoly capital.

    Since Jiménez seized power by force in 1948, he has implemented a military dictatorship. At the end of 1952, when Venezuela held a general election, he arrested Rómulo Betancourt, the chairman of the Democratic Action party who had won the majority of votes, and then usurped the presidential position himself. Last November, he again used violence to coerce the people, preventing them from electing other presidential candidates and electing others as president, and so he was re-elected as president.

    After Jiménez came to power, he declared all democratic parties and democratic and peace groups in Venezuela to be "illegal." Anyone who expressed dissatisfaction with his tyranny was subjected to his persecution. In October 1951 alone, Jiménez imprisoned six thousand opposition party members and non-party members. In 1952, he imprisoned three batches of "political prisoners," totaling more than nine hundred people, in concentration camps. During his dictatorial rule, a total of more than 30,000 people were arrested and imprisoned or massacred, and more than 20,000 people were forced into exile abroad. Most trade union organizations were dissolved, hundreds of newspapers and periodicals were closed down, and freedom of the press and publication was completely deprived.

    Jiménez was so cruel and inhumane to his own people, but he was servile to American monopoly capital. The American "New York World-Telegram and the Sun" said: Among all Latin American countries, "Venezuela is a paradise for private companies." Foreign capital "can convert profits into U.S. dollars and remit them abroad at will." Metzger, the deputy manager of the Venezuelan subsidiary of New Jersey Standard Oil, said even more gleefully: "The current economic and political relations between the United States and Venezuela are a model of international friendship." It is precisely for this reason that Jiménez received the highest award from the U.S. government.

    Venezuela is located in the northern part of South America and is a famous oil-producing country. Its oil production ranks second in the capitalist world, and its oil exports rank first in the world. 60% of Venezuela's treasury revenue relies on the oil industry. However, 99% of the country's oil extraction industry is controlled by American capital. At present, American capital in Venezuela has reached three billion U.S. dollars, and the profits it seizes annually are about six hundred million U.S. dollars. In addition to oil, Venezuela's iron ore mining is also completely controlled by the American "Bethlehem Steel Corporation" and "U.S. Steel Corporation." There are now three hundred American companies of various sizes in Venezuela, with 40,000 employees. As soon as Jiménez came to power, he announced that Venezuela would implement an "open door" policy for foreign capital, allowing them to plunder the country's resources at will. In 1956, Jiménez handed over more than 300,000 hectares of oil leases to American capital. On Venezuelan territory, American capital has also built its own railways and ports, operated waterways, and controlled the economic lifeline of Venezuela.

    In 1951, the Jiménez regime also signed an "Army Agreement" with the United States, stipulating that the Venezuelan army would be trained by the United States. In 1953, another "Air Force Agreement" was signed, allowing the American Air Force "Advisory Group" to be stationed in Venezuela. In foreign policy, the Jiménez regime has always followed the dictates of the United States. Therefore, Venezuela is actually completely in the position of an American colony. Even the "New York Times" admitted: The Jiménez regime is only maintained by the generosity of foreign companies and by maintaining close ties with the U.S. State Department.

    Under the reactionary rule, especially under the violent rule of Jiménez for ten years, the Venezuelan people have lived in extreme poverty. One-third of the country's approximately six million residents are unemployed, two-thirds are illiterate, and 500,000 children cannot attend school.

    However, the Venezuelan people will not forever succumb to the rule of U.S. imperialism and the domestic dictatorial government. In 1947, they won the first general election in more than a hundred years, and the government elected by the general election promulgated the first democratic constitution. On January 1 this year, an armed uprising broke out in Venezuela. The mass movement of people from all walks of life against the Jiménez dictatorial regime has played a major role from beginning to end. The national general strike and mass struggles were massive. Although subjected to Jiménez's brutal suppression, the armed uprising, with the support of workers, peasants, students, and other sectors, finally achieved victory on January 23.

    Currently, the military junta committee headed by Rear Admiral Wolfgang Larrazábal has seized power. Under strong pressure from the masses, the military junta has announced some democratic measures, but in reality, the military junta has excluded those who truly led the uprising from participating in the government. Moreover, not only has it not taken any steps to safeguard independent sovereignty, but it has also guaranteed to treat American colonialists in a "friendly" manner, which is contrary to the will of the people.

### 委内瑞拉的起义

    委内瑞拉的起义
    委内瑞拉经过三周的武装起义和强大的群众运动，已把一贯为美国垄断资本服务的希门尼斯暴政推翻了。
    希门尼斯从1948年以武力夺得政权以来，一直实行军事独裁统治。1952年底，委内瑞拉实行普选时，他把获得多数票的共和民主同盟主席阿卡耶逮捕起来，而后自己窃居总统职位。去年11月，他又用暴力威逼，不许人民推选旁人作总统候选人和选举其他人当总统，于是他又连任总统。
    希门尼斯上台以后，宣布委内瑞拉一切民主党派、民主与和平团体为“非法”。凡是对他的暴政表示不满的人，都要遭到他的陷害。仅在1951年10月，希门尼斯就把六千名反对党人士和无党派人士关进了监狱。1952年，又把三批“政治犯”共九百多人，关进了集中营。在他的独裁统治时期，总共有三万多人被捕入狱或遭到屠杀，有两万多人被迫流亡外国。大部分工会组织都被解散，成百种报刊被封闭，新闻出版自由完全被剥夺了。
    希门尼斯对本国人民是如此残暴不仁，而对美国垄断资本却是俯首贴耳。美国“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”说：在所有拉丁美洲国家中，“委内瑞拉是私营公司的乐园”。外国资本“可以随心所欲地把利润换成美元汇出国外”。在委内瑞拉的新泽西美孚油公司子公司副经理梅次格更得意忘形地说：“目前美国和委内瑞拉在经济和政治上的关系是国际友好的榜样”。正是由于这个缘故，希门尼斯得到了美国政府的最高奖赏。
    委内瑞拉位于南美洲北部，是一个著名的石油之国，石油产量占资本主义世界的第二位，石油输出占世界第一位。委内瑞拉国库60％的收入依靠石油工业。但是这个国家的石油开采业的99％由美国资本控制。目前美国在委内瑞拉的资本已达三十亿美元，一年攫取的利润已约达六亿美元。除石油以外，委内瑞拉的铁矿石开采也完全操纵在美国“伯利恒钢铁公司”和“美国钢铁公司”的手里。现在美国在委内瑞拉有大小三百个公司，工作人员达四万人。希门尼斯一上台就宣布委内瑞拉向外国资本实行“开放门户”的政策，让它们任意掠夺国家的资源。在1956年，希门尼斯拱手送给美国资本的石油租借地达三十多万公顷。在委内瑞拉的国土上，美国资本还修建了自己的铁路和港口，经营河道，控制着委内瑞拉的经济命脉。
    1951年，希门尼斯政权还同美国签订了“陆军协定”，规定由美国训练委内瑞拉的陆军，1953年又签订了“空军协定”，让美国空军“顾问团”驻在委内瑞拉。在对外政策上，希门尼斯政权从来就是唯美国之命是从。所以，委内瑞拉实际上已经完全处于美国殖民地的地位。甚至“纽约时报”也承认：希门尼斯政权只是靠外国公司的施舍以及靠同美国国务院保持密切联系而维持的。
    在反动统治下，特别是在希门尼斯十年来的暴力统治下，委内瑞拉人民过着十分穷困的生活。这个约六百万人口的国家有三分之一的居民不能就业，三分之二的人是文盲，五十万儿童不能入学。
    但是，委内瑞拉人民是不会永远屈服于美帝国主义和国内独裁政府的统治之下的。他们曾在1947年争得了一百多年来的第一次普选，由普选产生的政府颁布了第一个民主宪法。今年1月1日，委内瑞拉爆发了武装起义。各阶层人民反对希门尼斯独裁政权的群众运动，自始至终起了主要作用。全国的总罢工和群众斗争声势浩大。虽然受到希门尼斯的残酷镇压，但是，武装起义在工农群众、学生和其他各界人士的支持下，终于在1月23日取得了胜利。
    现在，以拉腊萨巴耳海军少将为首的军政府委员会掌握了政权。军政府在群众的强大压力下，曾宣布采取一些民主措施，但是实际上军政府排斥了真正领导起义的人参加政府，并且不仅没有采取任何维护独立主权的步骤，还保证“友好”地对待美国殖民者，这都是违反人民的意志的。
