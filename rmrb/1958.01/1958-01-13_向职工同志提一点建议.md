    A Suggestion for Employee Comrades
    Jiangsu, Wuxi  Da Ming
    Currently, many factory employees are studying the Forty Articles on Agriculture, preparing to contribute their efforts to support agriculture from their respective positions. This action will surely be welcomed by the broad masses of peasants. I would like to raise an issue that deserves the attention of employee comrades. I hope that all employee comrades with families in the countryside will also educate their family members, educating them to actively participate in agricultural production in the countryside. I raise this issue for a reason. Once, I heard the secretary of the district committee in the suburbs of Wuxi say that employee family members account for 15% of the total population in the suburbs. They are usually unwilling to actively engage in production, lead very special lives, and often argue with commune and township cadres over grain issues during the autumn harvest distribution. The cadres are very troubled by employee family members, and the general commune members also have opinions. Some commune members satirize employee family members, saying: "Bringing back fifty or sixty yuan a month, there's no need to lift a finger. You're just like new landlords!"
    When you hear these words, you may not be happy; however, the phenomenon of employee family members being unwilling to work in the fields and leading special lives has existed for a long time. Now, large numbers of cadres are going to the countryside and mountains, and large numbers of young students are participating in agricultural production, but only employee family members remain indifferent, residing in the countryside but not actively participating in labor. How can this not give the peasants cause for complaint?
    Of course, not all employee family members in the countryside are not fond of labor, only some of them behave badly. But even if it's just a portion, it's not a small problem!
    Therefore, when you are making your personal plan for supporting agricultural production with the Forty Articles, it's best to include the item of educating family members and encouraging them to actively participate in agricultural production in your personal plan. When you send money to the countryside every month, you should also appropriately arrange for their lives, educate them to be thrifty and manage the household well, and encourage them to actively participate in labor, striving to be good commune members. Don't think that sending money is all that you need to do to fulfill your family responsibilities.

### 向职工同志提一点建议

    向职工同志提一点建议
    江苏无锡  大明
    现在，不少工厂的职工正在学习农业纲要四十条，准备从自己的岗位上为支援农业而献出一份力量。这种行动，一定会受到广大农民的欢迎。我想提出一个值得职工同志注意的问题，希望凡是家在农村的职工同志，对自己的家属也要进行教育，教育她（他）们在农村里要积极参加农业生产。我提出这个问题是有原因的。有一次，我听无锡市郊区的区委书记说，郊区有占总人口15％的职工家属，平时不肯积极生产，生活很特殊，到秋收分配时因粮食问题经常和社干乡干吵。干部对职工家属很感头痛，一般社员也有意见。有些社员讽刺职工家属说：“按月带回来五十六十块钱，用不着动手了，真像个新地主！”
    你们听了这话，也许不高兴；可是，职工家属不肯下田劳动，生活表现特殊的现象，是由来已久了。现在，大批干部下乡上山，大批青年学生参加农业生产，而独独只有职工家属却无动于衷，居住在农村而不积极参加劳动，这怎么能使农民没有意见呢？
    当然，不是所有在农村的职工家属都是不热爱劳动的，只是其中有一部分人表现不好而已。但即使就是一部分，也不是个小问题呀！
    因此，当你要订支援农业生产四十条的个人规划时，最好把向家属进行教育、鼓励家属积极参加农业生产这一条，也订到个人的规划里去。当你按月向农村寄钱的时候，也要适当地为家里安排一下生活，教育她们勤俭持家，鼓励她们积极参加劳动，争取做个好社员。不要把钱一寄就算尽到你的养家责任了。
