Why Does Oily Soup Not Emit Steam but Scald Your Mouth?

　　Oil is lighter than water and always floats on the surface of the soup. If this layer of oil is relatively thick, the heat of the soup will not easily escape, but it will be very hot to drink.

　　When a layer of oil covers the surface of the soup, because the boiling point of oil is much higher than that of water (the boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius, and the boiling point of cooking oil is about 200 degrees Celsius, with slight differences among various cooking oils), even though the temperature of the soup is already quite high, like boiling water that scalds the mouth, it is still far from the boiling point of the oil, so the oil will not emit steam. The water underneath the oil is covered by the oil, and the heat cannot escape either. If people only use steam to measure the temperature of the soup, they will be fooled.

    有油的汤为什么不冒热气而烫嘴？
    油比水轻，总是浮在汤面上。假如这层油比较厚，汤的热气就不容易冒出来，但喝起来却非常烫。
    当汤面上盖上一层油的时候，由于油的沸点比水高得多（水的沸点摄氏一百度，食油的沸点约摄氏二百多度，各种不同的食油稍有差别）。因此虽然汤的温度已相当高，像开水似的烫嘴，但离油的沸点还很远，所以油就不会冒热气。而油底下的水，被油盖着，热气也冒不出来。喝汤的人如果只用热气来衡量汤的温度，便会上当。
