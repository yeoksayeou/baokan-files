    Beautiful Vista
    Within fifteen years, the Soviet Far East will be developed into a region with comprehensively developed industrial sectors. The conditions are ripe: abundant mineral deposits underground, and endless forests and water resources above ground. The immediate plan is to massively immigrate people and rapidly build hydroelectric power stations. In the future, there will be numerous large power stations and industrial and mining enterprises, as well as newly emerged cities and towns.
    This is a monumental undertaking far more arduous and grand than "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains." But the Communists have such a revolutionary drive, daring to conquer any difficulty, transform nature, and create benefits for the people. The city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, already established on the Amur River, is a testament to this. This prosperous city was pioneered by countless members of the Communist Youth League from the icy wilderness. Today's long-term planning is not a difficult problem for the Soviet people.

    美丽图景
    苏联远东地区十五年内将要发展成为一个各种工业部门综合发展的地区。条件具备：地下有丰富的矿藏，地上有无尽的森林和水力资源；眼前的计划是大量移民和迅速兴建水电站；将来这里会有林立的大电站和工矿企业以及新出现的城市和村镇。
    这是一项比“愚公移山”艰巨得多、伟大得多的巨业。但是共产党人就有这么一股革命干劲，敢于征服任何困难，改造大自然，为人民造福。在阿穆尔河上已经建立起来的共青城就是明证。这座繁荣的城市就是无数共青团员们从冰雪荒野中开拓出来的。今天的长期规划对苏维埃人来说，并不是什么难题。
