    埃及非常重视讨论国际大事
    纳赛尔欢迎召开最高级会议
    新华社开罗27日电　埃及总统纳赛尔在给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的复信中，表示欢迎苏联提出的召开有埃及参加的最高级会议的建议，并且表示埃及愿意尽一切努力来缓和世界紧张局势，解决国际争端和结束“冷战”。
    “人民报”26日刊登了这封复信的摘要。据报道，这封信已经在1月22日交给苏联外交部副部长。
    “人民报”报道：纳赛尔在复信中说，埃及政府非常重视讨论重大的国际问题，深信有必要寻找缓和国际紧张局势和使国际关系恢复正常的办法。他说，埃及欢迎任何可能使世界各国人民有机会为人类安全进行合作的步骤。
    纳赛尔指出了埃及所奉行的不参加集团的政策以及积极中立政策。
    纳赛尔在谈到中东紧张局势的时候说，这种紧张局势不是由于这个地区本身固有的因素所引起的，而是外来的非法干涉的结果。
    纳赛尔说，由于埃及的地理位置和它对苏伊士运河的所有权，它支持世界贸易自由。埃及相信：这个观点对于各国人民、尤其对于经济上不发达的国家是有益的。
