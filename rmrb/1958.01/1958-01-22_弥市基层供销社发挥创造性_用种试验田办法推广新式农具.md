Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 21st. The Mishi Basic-Level Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, has achieved excellent results in promoting new farm tools and chemical fertilizers by implementing the method of "everyone delving into technology, focusing on experimentation."

Over the past year, the staff of the Mishi Basic-Level Supply and Marketing Cooperative, engaged in the management of production materials, closely cooperated with the local township and commune Party organizations to conduct over 80 mu of trial plots for promoting new farm tools for various crops, such as cotton, wheat, and rice, throughout the district. These trial plots generally set new records for increased production, demonstrating the superiority of new farm tools and making them widely popular among the masses. For example, one mu and three fen of trial cotton field with poor soil quality was compared with one mu and five fen of cotton field with better soil quality located next to it. The trial plot yielded 489 jin of good seed cotton, while the adjacent one mu and five fen field only yielded a little over 219 jin. This agricultural cooperative, guided and driven by the technology of the trial plot, also became one of the county's cotton production increase cooperatives. To thank the supply and marketing cooperative for helping with the trial plot, they joyfully presented the supply and marketing cooperative with a banner that read "Advanced Technology, Exemplary Model" with drums and gongs. After seeing this, farmers from far and wide generally requested the staff of the supply and marketing cooperative to conduct trial plots in their cooperatives.

In the process of conducting trial plots, this basic-level supply and marketing cooperative paid attention to organizing visits and evaluations through the local Party committee to expand its influence. The Tianbao Township Distribution Center applied ammonium sulfate to a wheat field, and the wheat grew very well after ten days. At that time, the township Party committee organized more than 250 people to visit and evaluate it. After this visit and evaluation, local farmers immediately changed their order for 1,000 jin of chemical fertilizer to 53,000 jin and actually sold 71,892 jin. As a result of this basic-level cooperative's focus on experimentation, the supply of production materials reached 450,000 yuan last year, exceeding the plan by 18.5%.

Through trial plot activities, the staff of the Mishi Basic-Level Supply and Marketing Cooperative, engaged in the management of production materials, have also greatly trained and improved their technical level, and generally believe that conducting trial plots is better than staying in school. Wang Zuqing, who originally did not understand technology, not only mastered the technology after conducting trial plots, but also helped the agricultural cooperative open night schools and trained 35 technicians.

    弥市基层供销社发挥创造性
    用种试验田办法推广新式农具
    新华社武汉21日电　湖北省江陵县弥市基层供销社实行“人人钻技术，重点作试验”的方法推广新式农具和化学肥料，效果很好。
    弥市基层供销社经营生产资料的工作人员，一年来密切配合当地乡、社党组织，在全区范围内作了棉花、小麦、稻谷等各种推广新式农具的试验田八十多亩。这些试验田一般都创造了增产新纪录，显示了新式农具的优越性，使新式农具普遍受到群众欢迎。如试种的一亩三分土质很差的试验棉田，与连界的一亩五分土质较好的棉田比较，试验田收获四百八十九斤好籽花，而连界的一亩五分田只收了二百一十九斤多。这个农业社受试验田的技术指导、带动，也成为全县棉花增产社之一。他们为了感谢供销社搞试验田的帮助，敲锣打鼓欢欢喜喜地送给供销社一面“技术先进，示范楷模”的锦旗。远近农民看了，普遍要求供销社工作人员到他们的社里去搞试验田。
    在搞试验田过程中，这个基层供销社注意通过当地党委，组织参观评比，扩大影响。天保乡分销社把硫酸铵施在小麦田里，十天后小麦就长得很好，当时就通过乡党委组织二百五十多人参观评比。经过这次参观评比，当地农民马上把预订化学肥料一千斤改成了五万三千斤，而实销了七万一千八百九十二斤。这个基层社实行重点试验的结果，去年生产资料供应额达到四十五万元，超额18.5％完成计划。
    弥市基层供销合作社经营生产资料的工作人员，通过试验田活动，也大大锻炼和提高了自己的技术水平，普遍认为搞试验田比住学校还要好。汪祖清原来不懂技术，在搞了试验田后，不仅掌握了技术，还帮助农业社开办夜校，培养出技术员三十五人。
