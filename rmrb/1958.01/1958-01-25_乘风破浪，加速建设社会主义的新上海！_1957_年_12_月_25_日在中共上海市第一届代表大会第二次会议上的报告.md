Comrades,

In accordance with the agenda adopted by the Congress, the main task of this meeting is to discuss the current situation of our work, and to discuss and decide on how the Shanghai Party organization will rectify its style of work and improve its work.

I

Regarding the domestic and international situation, the Party Central Committee frequently provides us with comprehensive analyses. At this meeting, Comrade Zhou Enlai gave a political report titled "World Situation and Rectification Tasks," which has deepened our understanding of the situation and the overall picture. We must consider the overall picture when doing any work. The nation has its overall picture, the city has its overall picture, and each department and unit also has its own overall picture. Only by understanding the overall picture can we have a clear grasp and avoid losing direction. Some of our comrades often do not pay attention to the situation, do not pay attention to the overall picture, and do not pay attention to the comprehensive analysis of things. Sometimes they see achievements but not shortcomings; sometimes they see shortcomings but not achievements; and sometimes they cannot distinguish between the main and secondary aspects of achievements and shortcomings. To ensure that the rectification proceeds well, we also need to first look at the overall picture. Therefore, we need to discuss the situation, especially some issues that have been debated in the past period.

First, let's discuss the issue of the primary contradiction in our country.

The Central Committee has already given clear instructions on this. However, during the past period, some of our comrades were blown off course by the whirlwind stirred up by the bourgeois right-wing elements, doubting the Party's correct policy of handling contradictions among the people, as if some of the Party's fundamental policies were to the right. Although this wind was not very strong, it is worth noting.

Everyone knows that before the founding of the People's Republic of China, the primary contradiction for the Chinese people was with imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the three great enemies. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the transitional period began in our country, and the aforementioned primary contradiction was basically resolved domestically. The contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and the struggle between socialism and capitalism on two fronts, became the primary contradiction domestically. The three major transformations of capitalism in industry, agriculture, and handicrafts, which reached a peak in early 1956, marked the decisive victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front (in terms of ownership of the means of production) in our country. The contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in this regard was basically resolved. However, the socialist revolution is the most thorough, profound, and extensive revolution in terms of economics, politics, and ideology; the fundamental change in ownership has not yet been completely resolved on the economic front (ownership has not yet been completely changed, and the socialist material foundation, i.e., the development of modern industry and modern agriculture, is still very insufficient), and it has not yet been completely resolved on the political and ideological fronts of the socialist revolution. In the Party Constitution adopted at the Eighth National Congress of the Party, it is emphasized that the Party still faces the serious task of "completely eliminating the system of exploitation and eradicating the roots that produce the system of exploitation," and the serious task of "continuing to pay attention to overcoming capitalist factors and influences from the economic, political, and ideological aspects." Therefore, class struggle has not ended, and the question of who will defeat whom between socialism and capitalism has not been completely resolved. The struggle is long-term, tortuous, and sometimes even very intense. The contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the struggle between socialism and capitalism on two fronts, remains the primary contradiction throughout the transitional period. However, before the fundamental change in ownership, this contradiction was prominently manifested in the contradiction between production relations and productive forces, i.e., private ownership of the means of production restricted the development of social productive forces; and after the fundamental change in ownership, the contradiction between the two classes and the two roads is prominently manifested in the contradiction between the superstructure and the economic base, i.e., the political activities of the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois ideology are not in harmony with the socialist social system. A part of the bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals do not acknowledge the leadership of the proletariat on the political and ideological fronts and even attempt to seize this leadership, thereby undermining the socialist social system.

Under the current specific conditions in our country, this contradiction between the two classes and the two roads, in some areas, manifests as a contradiction between the enemy and us, and in other areas, it manifests as a contradiction within the people, and it is mostly manifested as a contradiction within the people, and only in a few cases does it manifest as a contradiction between the enemy and us. The old landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, their contradiction with the people is of course a contradiction between the enemy and us, but they have been completely isolated among the people. There are still some political capitalists who are a part of the bourgeoisie, i.e., the right-wing elements within the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals who have not yet been exposed. Their contradiction with the proletariat is also a contradiction between the enemy and us. However, whether among the people of the whole country or within the bourgeoisie, they only account for a very small number. Once they expose their anti-socialist face, they quickly fall into the encirclement of the broad masses. As for the majority of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals (the middle-of-the-roaders), although they are not completely convinced of the change in ownership and the leadership of the proletariat, generally speaking, they tend to accept the socialist road and the leadership of the proletariat, and their contradiction with the proletariat generally manifests as a contradiction within the people. Whether looking at the whole country or at Shanghai, where the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals are relatively concentrated, the situation is the same.

We can cite two real examples in front of us to prove the correctness of the Central Committee's analysis of the basic situation. One example is: this time, the Shanghai business community, led by the Party, carried out the anti-rightist struggle, which was mainly conducted by the business community itself. The first batch of 6,000 people, after a period of study, raised their awareness, learned the methods of speaking out loudly, presenting facts, and reasoning, and after entering the stage of anti-rightist struggle, exposed 248 right-wing elements, and the work was done very well. Currently, the movement is gradually being expanded to the entire business community. Another example is: in Fudan University, out of more than 600 teachers, 60% come from exploiting class families, 34.5% come from upper petty bourgeoisie families, and only 4.5% come from worker and peasant families. However, politically, the leftists plus the middle-leftists account for 44% (this proportion is relatively high in the city, generally around 30% in other universities), and the rightists account for only 8.5%. These two examples, can they not prove that, at least in the commercial and academic circles, the reform work in the past few years, especially in the past two years, has not been done badly, and their self-reform achievements are significant? Can they not prove that the situation has changed in favor of the proletariat and socialism? Can they not prove that their majority can progress through education, and it is completely correct to say that their contradiction with the working people belongs to the contradiction within the people?

Some of our comrades do not seriously study the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, that is, under the specific conditions of our country, if we handle it properly, if the bourgeoisie accepts the policies of the proletariat, the antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie can be transformed into a non-antagonistic contradiction. They do not see the great changes in the class relations in our country, do not seriously study the new developments around them, and have fixed their thoughts. They mistakenly regard the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in our country, and the struggle between socialism and capitalism on two fronts, as a contradiction between the enemy and us. They regard the wavering and dissatisfaction of the middle-of-the-road bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals who are not right-wing towards socialism as a contradiction between the enemy and us, and attempt to handle these contradictions with the methods of handling contradictions between the enemy and us, without understanding that different methods must be used to handle contradictions of different natures, and that it is necessary to adopt new forms to handle class struggle according to new situations.

Of course, not seeing the contradiction between the enemy and us is completely wrong and very dangerous. Since the contradiction between the enemy and us still exists, denying or ignoring the struggle between the enemy and us, regarding a part of the contradiction between the two classes and the two roads contained in the struggle, i.e., our struggle with the right-wing elements, as a contradiction within the people, will lead to rightist errors. Due to the class relations becoming sharp at times (for example, when the bourgeois right-wing elements are rampantly attacking) and becoming relaxed at times (for example, when the anti-rightist struggle achieves victory and the class enemy is forced to retreat), we must continue to be vigilant and pay attention to the development and changes in this aspect. When the class relations become sharp, we must emphasize this aspect of the struggle and resolutely smash the attacks of all anti-socialist and anti-labor elements, as was done in this anti-rightist struggle. However, given that the majority of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals (the middle-of-the-roaders) can accept socialist reform and the leadership of the proletariat, we should still trust the majority among them, help them carry out thorough reform, make them politically and ideologically draw a clear line with the right-wing elements, overcome the two-faced nature of wavering between the capitalist and socialist positions, pass the test of socialism, and strive to turn many of them from the middle-of-the-roaders to the leftists, expanding the ranks of the leftists. Of course, this is a long-term and repeated process, and there will still be changes in the middle. The majority will gradually progress and gradually be reformed, and there will also be a part that will not be reformed, but the number will not be large.

We say that the contradiction between the two classes and the two roads includes both contradictions between the enemy and us and contradictions within the people, but this does not mean that the contradictions within the people in our country at present all belong to the contradictions between the two classes and the two roads, and that there are no contradictions within the working people. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have instructed us that the contradictions within the people, in addition to existing between the general bourgeois elements and the working people, exist more broadly within the working people and within the working class. Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," as well as the editorials of the People's Daily "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" and "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat Again," have all given a comprehensive and profound analysis of this issue. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "In a socialist society, the basic contradiction remains the contradiction between production relations and productive forces, and the contradiction between the superstructure and the economic base.... Our socialist system has just been established, has not yet been completely built, and is not yet completely consolidated. In the public-private joint-venture enterprises in the industrial sector, the capitalists still receive fixed interest, which means there is still exploitation; in terms of ownership, these enterprises are not yet completely socialist in nature. A part of the agricultural production cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives are still semi-socialist in nature; completely socialist cooperatives still need to continue to solve some individual issues in terms of ownership. In various economic sectors, the mutual relationship between production and exchange is still being established and seeking relatively appropriate forms according to socialist principles. In the economy of full public ownership and collective ownership, and between these two forms of socialist economy, the problem of the distribution of accumulation and consumption is a complex problem and cannot be solved completely reasonably at once. In short, the socialist production relations have been established and are adapted to the development of productive forces; but they are still very imperfect, and these imperfect aspects are in contradiction with the development of productive forces. In addition to the situation where production relations and the development of productive forces are both adapted and contradictory, there is also the situation where the superstructure and the economic base are both adapted and contradictory. The state system of people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist ideology guided by Marxism-Leninism have played an active role in promoting the victory of socialist transformation and the establishment of socialist labor organization in our country, and it is adapted to the socialist economic base, i.e., the socialist production relations; but the existence of bourgeois ideology, the existence of some bureaucratic tendencies in the state apparatus, and the existence of some defects in the state system are in contradiction with the socialist economic base. In the future, we must, according to specific situations, continue to solve the various contradictions mentioned above." The various contradictions pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong here, some belong to the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, some belong to the contradiction between the petty bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and some are due to the bourgeois and petty bourgeois ideological tendencies infecting many people within the proletariat, thus producing contradictions within the proletariat. However, there are still many contradictions that are not due to the existence of class or class influence, but due to the subjective consciousness of people not being in line with objective reality, and the leadership work lagging behind the needs of the masses. This is a contradiction between the subjective and the objective, the advanced and the backward, and this type of contradiction will continue to appear even after the complete elimination of class and class influence. In a socialist society that can be considered completely consolidated compared to the transitional period, and in the communist society of the future billions of years, the development of production relations will still lag behind the development of productive forces at certain periods, and the development of the superstructure will still lag behind the development of the economic base at certain periods. Therefore, it is still necessary to timely discover the daily and special contradictions in the economic and political systems and timely adjust them. With the correct system, it is still necessary to correctly use this system, and it is still necessary to have correct policies, correct work methods, and work styles. In all these aspects, how the leadership work is done, whether it is good or bad, whether it adopts the dialectical materialist method of thinking or the subjective and one-sided method of thinking, whether it is ahead of objective reality and the awakening of the masses or lagging behind, has a great effect. In short, after the elimination of class contradictions, the contradictions between right and wrong, innovation and conservatism, advanced and backward, active and passive, and so on, will continue to appear in various different conditions and situations. And human society will continue to advance in the process of overcoming these contradictions. Contradictions are forever the driving force for the advancement of human society.

From this, it can be seen that the contradictions within the people need to be analyzed. Taking the Party's rectification as an example, we need to focus on opposing the bureaucratic and sectarian tendencies in the rectification, and focus on criticizing individualism, liberalism, anarchism, absolute egalitarianism, and nationalism. These are reflections of the influence of bourgeois and petty bourgeois ideology. However, the subjectivist tendency we need to oppose is a matter of cognition. We need to solve many contradictions between the advanced and the backward, such as the debates over the speed of industrial development and agricultural development, and the different estimates of the speed of the development of the situation. Such debates will always exist in the future. For this type of contradiction, it cannot be regarded as a reflection of class contradiction, let alone be treated as a contradiction between the enemy and us.

Some of our comrades doubted the Party's timely proposal to correctly handle the contradictions within the people and doubted the correctness of some of the Party's fundamental policies, mainly because they did not specifically analyze the class relations and the primary contradictions in our country, and lacked specific analysis of contradictions of different natures.

Some of our comrades like to use coercive methods to handle contradictions within the people, always feeling that the method of persuasion is slow or ineffective. This is groundless. It seems that they are very "leftist," but in fact, it precisely shows that they are very "rightist." The facts have proven that persuading the people is the most active and effective method of Marxism. We comrades believe in Marxism and believe in the ultimate victory of communism, is it not the result of being persuaded rather than being coerced? Why can we be persuaded by advanced comrades, but we cannot use the same method to persuade others? Using coercive methods on the people, this is nothing but the method used by all exploiting classes in history to deal with the exploited classes, and the method used by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek is the most skilled in surrendering to imperialism and using "authority" on the people. We must reverse the influence of the Kuomintang style, and we must not use "authority" on the people. We must believe in the majority of the masses, and we must believe that the Party can persuade the majority and unite all possible people, reform the old society, create a new society, and in this process, transform the people of the old society into people of the socialist society. Under the system of exploitation, the old society trained people to be selfish and self-seeking, but under the conditions of the new society, with the gradual deepening of political and ideological struggles and the increasingly strong and consolidated socialist economic base, it is possible to finally eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology and transform the people of the old society into people with the selfless and public-spirited thoughts of the proletariat. This is of course a long-term process. However, the laws of social movement and social development in our country tell us that the situation is favorable for us to do this.

The experience of the rectification movement most powerfully illustrates the great effectiveness of using the method of persuasion on the people. Through the nationwide rectification and anti-rightist struggle this year, many of our comrades have learned to use the methods of speaking out loudly, debating vigorously, posting big-character posters, holding debate meetings, etc., to correctly handle a large number of problems within the working class, within the laboring people, and within the class contradictions with the bourgeoisie, and have gained very valuable experience. At the same time, we have also gained experience in using the methods of speaking out loudly, debating vigorously, presenting facts, and reasoning, that is, also using the methods of handling contradictions within the people, to handle the contradiction between us and the bourgeois right-wing elements, this kind of contradiction between the enemy and us. This is a very important achievement. However, we still have many comrades who have not learned or have not completely learned this set of methods, and many comrades still resist the work methods of seeking truth from facts and the mass line. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels and leading comrades at all levels must make up their minds, not only to have a clear understanding of the current class relations and the primary contradictions in the country and the large number of existing contradictions, but also to help Party organizations at all levels, down to the grassroots Party organizations and grassroots cadres, to see the situation clearly, distinguish between various types of contradictions, and be able to handle them correctly. As long as we all have experience and completely learn this set of methods of speaking out loudly, debating vigorously, big-character posters, meetings, debates, presenting facts, reasoning, rectifying while changing, etc., and turn it into a regular institution and method, many things will be easier to handle in the future. Whether it is a revolutionary issue or a construction issue, whether it is a major issue or a minor issue, it can be quickly resolved using this set of methods.

Next, we need to estimate our achievements.

Although the bourgeois right-wing elements say that we have messed up this and that, after the anti-rightist struggle and the nationwide debate, people have already clearly seen that our Party has led the people of all ethnic groups to achieve great unity, carried out a tremendous revolution, and launched a rapid construction. This is something that even the enemies of socialism cannot deny, because it is an ironclad fact. After the three major transformations that reached a peak in 1956, our country has basically completed the socialist revolution on the economic front (in terms of ownership of the means of production). Such a profound revolution in Chinese history was realized by peaceful means, and there was no fluctuation and destruction in the economy and social order. This is a great success. This year's nationwide rectification and anti-rightist struggle have also achieved great victories on the political and ideological fronts. This is another great success. Our country's first Five-Year Plan has been completed and overfulfilled. In fact, some important tasks and important indicators were completed and overfulfilled as early as 1956. The initial foundation for our country's industrialization has been laid. Our country's agriculture is advancing under the new conditions after collectivization. Our country's scientific and cultural undertakings are becoming more prosperous. Our country's face has been fundamentally changed, and our country's international status has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Due to the implementation of the instructions of the Party Central Committee on correctly handling contradictions within the people and a series of policies such as "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," etc., all forces that can be mobilized in the country are being mobilized to serve socialism. The unity of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party, is becoming stronger and more consolidated. The Chinese people, with the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong and filling the sea like the little bird Jijing, are transforming the old society and building a new China. These are facts that no one can deny.

As for the work on various fronts in Shanghai, it is the same. The most important thing is that we have basically transformed the capitalist and commercial industries, which account for a large proportion of the country, into socialist economy, and basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, thus changing the political and economic face of Shanghai and opening up a broad road for the construction of Shanghai. The various indicators for economic and cultural construction in Shanghai, as stipulated in the country's first Five-Year Plan, have also been completed and overfulfilled. This year, Shanghai's total industrial output value is expected to be 128 billion yuan, of which 3 billion yuan is handicraft output value, and 125 billion yuan is industrial output value, accounting for about 20% of the country's industrial output value, exceeding the indicator of the first Five-Year Plan by 16.3%, increasing by 297.51% compared to the early days of liberation in 1949, and increasing by 96% compared to 1952 before the start of the first Five-Year Plan, with an average annual growth of 14.5%. In the total industrial output value, the proportion of heavy industry, general light industry, and textile industry has also changed from 16.7%, 22.6%, and 60% in 1949 to 41.2%, 26.2%, and 32.6% in 1957. This is a very important change. With the development of national economic construction and the transformation of Shanghai's economy, Shanghai's industry has manufactured a large number of new products, and the machinery manufacturing industry has changed from being able to only assemble to being able to independently manufacture. The quality of many products has reached the international level, which makes this industrial base able to supply more production materials and living materials to the people of the whole country, able to supply more materials for the development of domestic and foreign trade, and able to accumulate more construction funds for the state. This is another very important change. The victory of agricultural collectivization in the suburbs, combined with the favorable conditions of Shanghai, has prepared the conditions for striving to complete the tasks stipulated in the "Outline for Agricultural Development in China (Draft)" ahead of time. The cultural and educational front and other fronts have also achieved great results. Labor employment has gradually expanded, and the historical legacy of unemployment has been basically eliminated. More importantly, people have changed. The various political movements and social reform movements in recent years have not only tempered the Shanghai working class, raising the political awareness, organizational level, and technical level of Shanghai workers, enabling them to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the leading class, but have also promoted the political and ideological transformation of people from all walks of life. This year's anti-rightist struggle has proven that the glorious Shanghai workers, especially the old workers, are the most resolute force in defending socialism; it has proven that other people from all walks of life have made great progress in recent years, and a powerful leftist force has formed among them; the middle-of-the-roaders have also made different degrees of progress; and the rightists account for only a very small number. Without the improvement of socialist awareness among the broad masses, it would be impossible to isolate and split the right-wing elements and make them suffer a serious defeat in such a short time. Although the nationwide rectification movement has not yet ended, it has already brought us incomparable strength, promoting the work on various fronts in Shanghai to advance by a big step. Anyone can see that today's Shanghai is no longer the old Shanghai of colonialism and semi-colonialism. The adventurer's paradise of the old Shanghai has gone with the dark times. A new Shanghai of the people has grown up in the storm of the socialist revolution. Tomorrow's Shanghai will be a more powerful base for the socialist economic and cultural construction of our motherland, and a more powerful fortress standing on the national defense front line of the East China Sea.

The reason why Shanghai's work has achieved these results is the result of the heroic struggle and selfless labor of the million workers in Shanghai, the result of the united struggle of the seven million people in Shanghai, the result of the full support of the people of the whole country, the result of the wise leadership of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and also the result of the efforts of the Shanghai Party organizations and the broad cadres to earnestly and actively implement the various correct policies of the Party Central Committee. When reviewing these great achievements, we express our warm congratulations to the workers and people of all walks of life in the city, and express our deep thanks to the people of the whole country. At the same time, the working class of Shanghai and the people of Shanghai, like the working class and the people of the whole country, are all proud to have the wise leadership of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong.

Here, we need to answer a question: Has the development of various aspects of work in Shanghai been too fast, is it "rushing ahead"?

Some comrades once thought that all aspects of our work in Shanghai were "rushing ahead." This was particularly evident in the debate over Shanghai's industrial policy. Everyone remembers that the first session of the Shanghai Municipal Party Congress in 1956 determined the policy of "fully utilizing and rationally developing" Shanghai's industry. This policy, on the one hand, opposed the idea of ignoring the role of Shanghai as an industrial base and not paying attention to utilizing this base to serve the socialist construction of the country; on the other hand, it also opposed the idea of blindly developing without considering the overall planning of the country and the specific conditions of the locality. The facts have proven that this policy has brought vitality to Shanghai's work and promoted the vigorous development of various aspects of work. Some comrades said that due to this policy, various aspects of work in Shanghai have "rushed ahead." This view does not conform to the actual situation. From an overall perspective, it is precisely because of this policy that various positive factors have been mobilized, and the blind development of various aspects has been restricted. The development of Shanghai's work in the past year has been normal. The problem is that there are completely different understandings of what is normal and what is rushing ahead.

In the preface to the book "The Socialist High Tide in China's Countryside" written by Comrade Mao Zedong on December 27, 1955, he analyzed the basic situation of our country's socialist construction as follows: "The problem now facing the whole Party and the people of the whole country is no longer the problem of criticizing rightist conservative thoughts in the speed of socialist transformation in agriculture, this problem has been solved. It is also no longer the problem of the speed of implementing full public-private joint ventures in the capitalist and commercial industry, this problem has also been solved. The problem of the speed of socialist transformation in handicrafts can be discussed in the first half of 1956, and this problem will be easily solved. The current problem is not in these aspects, but in other aspects. Here, there are problems in agricultural production, industrial (including state-owned, public-private joint ventures, and cooperative) and handicraft production, the scale and speed of basic construction in industry and transportation, the coordination of commerce with other economic sectors, the coordination of science, culture, education, health, and other items with various economic undertakings, etc. In these aspects, there are shortcomings in the estimation of the situation, and they all need to be criticized and overcome to adapt to the development of the overall situation. People's thoughts must adapt to the changed situation. Of course, no one can fantasize without basis, and no one can plan their actions beyond the conditions allowed by the objective situation, and do things that cannot really be done. However, the current problem is that rightist conservative thoughts are still at work in many aspects, making many aspects of work unable to adapt to the development of the objective situation. The current problem is that things that can be done through effort are considered impossible by many people. Therefore, it is completely necessary to continuously criticize the rightist conservative thoughts that indeed exist." Comrade Mao Zedong's words are worth reading and pondering repeatedly. "The current problem is that things that can be done through effort are considered impossible by many people," is our comrades' thoughts not like this?

We believe that since we are doing the socialist revolution and socialist construction, doing this unprecedented business, doing this business of competing with imperialism for time and speed, we must have a revolutionary spirit. We must take an active attitude towards all factors in Shanghai that are beneficial to socialism, and strive to turn negative factors into positive factors, and according to the overall planning of the state, think of all kinds of ways and means, fully utilize the Shanghai base to serve socialism. Therefore, in our view, as long as it can be done through effort, it should be done, this is a normal phenomenon; not doing it through effort, this is an abnormal phenomenon. Otherwise, it is not about revolutionary attitude, revolutionary spirit, and revolutionary speed, it is not about building our country into a socialist power as soon as possible. Therefore, we should resolutely implement the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" frugal construction. This is a unified and indivisible policy. To achieve "more, faster, better," we need to be frugal and make efforts; to achieve "more economical," we also need to be frugal and make efforts. This policy opposes both rightist conservatism and impetuousness. This is a policy of promotion, not "retreat," and is the only correct policy that our country's socialist construction should adopt in the current international environment, and it is a correct policy that has been proven effective in practice. In the process of implementing this policy, individual shortcomings and errors may occur, but we cannot waver about the overall policy because of this. Some people have taken the opposite view of the Party, they regard this revolutionary attitude, revolutionary spirit, and revolutionary speed as rushing ahead, as "seeking quick success and instant benefits." They always say this is too much, that is too fast, this is rushing ahead, that is rushing ahead. They just do not see whether socialism has advanced or capitalism has advanced; whether socialism has more and faster, or capitalism has more and faster; whether it is "good" socialism's "great" and "like" socialism's "achievements," or the opposite. Ask, through effort, can socialism advance faster and more, is this wrong? Is it correct to say that things that can be done through effort are not done, so that the cause of socialism advances slower and less, is this correct and normal? Is it correct to say that resolutely implementing the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" is called "seeking quick success and instant benefits," and should be criticized, while implementing the opposite policy should be praised? Of course, there are people who praise, but they will definitely not come from the broad masses who yearn for the early establishment of a socialist society. Therefore, we must criticize this actually existing rightist conservative thought. This thought has caused us some losses. Since the second half of last year, the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" has not been much mentioned, and the implementation of the plan for "The Outline for Agricultural Development in China" has also been lackluster, and the revolutionary spirit of many people has declined. This is the abnormal phenomenon. In the rectification movement, we must criticize this rightist conservative viewpoint and correct various abnormal phenomena, so as to welcome the new construction upsurge and promote the new upsurge of the construction cause.

II

Our work has achieved great achievements, this is the main aspect, this is completely affirmative, and there should be no doubt. If there is any doubt, it should be explained. However, there are also many shortcomings and errors in our work. Now we need to talk about these shortcomings and errors.

Since April this year, in various rounds of speaking out, Party members and non-Party members have raised several million criticisms and suggestions (many of which are repetitive). These criticisms and suggestions include criticisms of Party organizations and cadres at all levels, and there are also many criticisms of our Municipal Party Committee and leading comrades of the Municipal Party Committee. The criticisms of Party organizations and Party cadres at all levels are actually criticisms of our Municipal Party Committee. These criticisms, except for those of a right-wing nature, are mostly well-intentioned, correct, or basically correct. Although some are not completely correct, and even most are not correct, they are only due to cognitive issues, not due to malice. These criticisms have helped us understand many things we did not understand in our daily work, helped us understand the psychological state of the critics, and helped us see a clearer picture of our work, which is still beneficial. To all Party members and non-Party members who have raised well-intentioned criticisms to help the Party with rectification, the Municipal Party Committee expresses its sincere thanks.

The criticisms of the masses, no matter how many, can be summed up as follows: we need to change our bureaucratic, sectarian, and subjective bad tendencies in work, organization, and style. Everyone knows that bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism are all detached from the masses and detached from reality, all hinder the progress of our comrades, hinder our unity, and hinder the progress of our cause, and are all incompatible with the fundamental interests of our Party and the people. Our Party fears nothing but imperialism, domestic reactionary forces, and the difficulties and hardships of fighting against nature, but it fears detachment from the masses. Detachment from the masses will inevitably lead to detachment from reality. The Party and the people are closely united, and there is no enemy that cannot be defeated, and no fortress that cannot be stormed. However, if we do not eliminate the shortcomings and errors of bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism, we will not be able to unite all possible forces, and we will not be able to advance smoothly. Not only that, if the shortcomings and errors are not eliminated, they will continue to develop and may even be fatal. The Marxist-Leninist and proletarian style of thinking developed in the struggle against non-Marxist and non-proletarian styles of thinking. Our Party is now a great and politically mature Marxist-Leninist party, and no evil wind can blow it down. But this does not mean that it is also impossible to blow down individual Party members and individual Party organizations. The rectification movement is precisely to help all comrades in the Party who are truly willing to fight for communism to the end, to arm themselves with Marxist-Leninist and proletarian thoughts, to overcome non-proletarian and non-Marxist-Leninist styles of thinking, and to become strong communist fighters. By struggling against the current shortcomings and errors, our comrades learn lessons, gain immunity, and greatly improve their ideological and work levels. The rectification movement in 1942 prepared the conditions for our victory in 1949. The rectification from 1957 to 1958 is to prepare the conditions for the thorough and comprehensive victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country. Therefore, we must boldly let go, resolutely let go, and thoroughly let go; boldly change, resolutely change, and thoroughly change.

The opinions raised by the masses during the rectification can be divided into three categories: first, work-related issues; second, organizational issues; third, style-related issues, especially the style issues of Party member leaders. In the 2,026,795 opinions raised during the speaking out sessions in the Party and mass organizations, political and legal, financial and trade, industrial, and municipal transportation systems, as well as the municipal people's committee and district-level organizations, opinions related to leadership style account for more than 50% of the total. In 217 large factories, 310,000 workers raised opinions, of which 35% were related to leadership style. The main issues with leadership style are that some Party member leaders have a certain degree of detachment from the masses. The masses' opinions on leadership style actually reflect their dissatisfaction with the "officialdom" of some Party member leaders to varying degrees. This rectification must first thoroughly eliminate this "officialdom." The situation of some Party member leaders detaching from the masses is roughly as follows:

Special treatment in life: living in large houses, using good furniture; high salary grades, bonuses, and subsidies; some cadres have not worked for several years but still get promoted, and their lives are not difficult, and they often receive subsidies. Not following personnel regulations, opening backdoors, and introducing private individuals. Not following organizational regulations and labor discipline. Some leading cadres do not participate in branch life, and some factory directors, Party committee secretaries, and Party cadres do not participate in the union. These phenomena of special treatment, although not universal, are not very serious, but have a bad influence.

Not being close to the masses, having a bad attitude towards the masses: many people criticize our Party leaders, including the leaders of the Municipal Party Committee, for seeing the masses less, going to the workshops, construction sites, fields, units, classrooms, and grassroots levels less, and even saying that we can only be seen in the newspapers. Some units' masses do not easily see their unit leaders. Some leading cadres, when they see the masses, are not friendly, "with both hands in their pockets, not even smiling"; some leading comrades lack the necessary humility, are arrogant towards the masses, overbearing, and full of officialdom. The masses also criticize our leading cadres' work, only knowing how to hold meetings and write documents, and some only know how to hold meetings, sometimes making the whole day from top to bottom meetings. Not only do leading cadres not go deep into the masses, but many grassroots cadres and activists are often pulled to attend meetings, and have little time to work among the masses. Many activists, once they join the Party, become estranged from the masses. Party members only stay with Party members, and the voices of the masses are not easily heard in the Party in a timely manner, but the leading comrades do not take this as a big problem, helping Party members improve their contact with the masses.

Insufficient democratic style in work: some comrades, when encountering things, seldom seriously consult with the masses, or do not consult with the masses, but only like administrative orders. When making decisions, they consider more of the subjective intentions of the leaders, analyze the opinions of the masses less, and do not unify the two aspects. There are more top-down arrangements for work, and fewer bottom-up consultations with the masses. Sometimes the masses have opinions about the work arranged by the leaders, reasonable opinions are not adopted, things that cannot be done are not explained or not explained in a timely manner, unreasonable things are not persuaded, and wrong things are not educated. Some leading cadres, when talking to the masses, also have more instructions and commands, making people afraid to look, and in the long run, the masses do not want to raise opinions. They say, raising opinions is useless, why bother? In this situation, the enthusiasm of the masses cannot be brought into play, and the leading work is very laborious and does not achieve good results.

Careless and procrastinating in handling matters: there are many problems that should have been solved and can be solved, but they are not solved in daily work, until this speaking out session, they are criticized by the masses and then solved. Especially for problems that truly exist among the masses, the timely concern for the various needs of the masses is not enough. The second textile factory's canvas workshop has a floor that is about one foot damaged, hindering production, workers have raised this issue for several years, but the leadership has ignored it until this speaking out session to solve it. On August 20, 1956, an office requested a car from the office management bureau, the document reached the office of the bureau, the director approved it to the general affairs department, the department head approved it to the transportation section, the transportation section gave its opinion to the department, the department head reported to the bureau chief, the bureau chief approved it to the secretary-general, the secretary-general said it should be reported to the deputy mayor, and thus it was returned unopened from the bureau chief—office director—general affairs director—transportation section chief, to the transportation section chief to write a report, and then back to the bureau chief. The bureau chief approved: "Already reported by telephone to the deputy mayor, instructed to handle according to the system." Thus, the document was sent back to the deputy secretary-general, approved "agree," sent to the secretary-general for review, and then according to the aforementioned office—general affairs department—transportation section order, finally filed, and it was already October 22. It was passed back and forth thirteen times, took two months, and never left the building of the Municipal People's Government.

Why do these shortcomings and errors exist in our Party?

On one hand, this is due to the infiltration of the old social habits, bourgeois, and Kuomintang style of thinking into our ranks. Among the 267,000 cadres in Shanghai (excluding primary and secondary school and public-private joint venture enterprise cadres), about 80% joined work after liberation. Among the 37,000 cadres at the section chief level and above, more than 56% also joined work after liberation. They are the new blood of our cadre team and have made many contributions to work. However, most of them come from non-proletarian backgrounds and have not undergone production labor and serious class struggle training, still retaining many non-proletarian styles of thinking. Even among the old cadres, some have more or less cultivated arrogance and complacency, and have been infected with the bad thoughts and styles of the old society.

On the other hand, this is also due to our lack of experience. The socialist revolution and socialist construction we are currently carrying out are unprecedented in Chinese history. Although the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong are good at combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of the Chinese revolution, for us broad cadres, we are still inexperienced or lack experience. Therefore, in implementing the various correct policies formulated by the Party Central Committee, it is still difficult to avoid deviations, and it is also difficult to timely recognize and correct these deviations.

As mentioned above, the existence of many shortcomings and errors reflects the shortcomings of the Municipal Party Committee's leadership. From an overall perspective, the Municipal Party Committee has implemented the policies and guidelines of the Central Committee, but the shortcomings lie in the lack of repeated education based on the policies and guidelines of the Central Committee combined with the actual thoughts of Shanghai cadres; in the deployment of major work tasks, there is a problem of being tight in the front and loose in the back, tight at times and loose at times; in the process of work, there is a lack of in-depth inspection of the implementation situation, and a lack of focusing on summarizing the successful and failed experiences to improve cadres and promote overall work. We are willing to make up our minds to work with everyone to overcome these shortcomings.

III

The key to correcting shortcomings and errors is first to have the determination, and second, after making up our minds, to have a set of correct rectification methods.

It can be said for sure that although the masses have raised many opinions, most of them can be summarized as completely correct and should be and can be corrected by the Party organizations at all levels in our city. The Water Products Institute analyzed the 3,404 opinions raised by the masses systematically, of which the two items of basically correct and partially correct and partially incorrect account for more than 91% of the total. Among these opinions, those that can be corrected immediately by themselves account for more than 64%, those that are correct but need to create conditions to correct account for about 20%, and the two combined account for more than 84% of the total; those that really need the help of higher authorities to solve are very few, only about 6%; and 9% of the opinions are things that cannot be done. The situation in other units is also roughly similar. This is because most of the problems are caused by their own work and style problems, "who tied the bell is who should untie it," as long as they make up their minds to untie the rope, the bell will be taken down.

The experiences of the Luwan District Committee, the Transportation Bureau, the Housing and Land Bureau, and the First Machine Tool Company are the most powerful proofs. According to the statistics of these four units, 19,000 opinions were raised during the speaking out session, of which 73.4% have been solved, 13.7% are being solved, and the two combined account for more than 87%. It can be seen that as long as one makes up one's mind, 90% of the problems are not difficult to solve.

For example, the masses are most dissatisfied with special treatment, is it difficult to change? If the house is too big, the furniture is too good, just move out; if the rent is too low, just increase it appropriately; if private matters are handled with public cars, just don't use them in the future; if subsidies are taken too much, just return them, and don't take too much in the future; for living and welfare issues, to prevent unfair and inappropriate handling, strengthen leadership and follow the mass line in the future, it will be easy to handle; if the level of an individual Party member is indeed too high, just appropriately lower it (but don't form a general adjustment of levels). Is it not very easy to do this?

Title: The Whole Party and the Whole People Must Work Together to Thoroughly Rectify the Style of Work and Achieve the Great Leap Forward in the Construction of Socialism

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 1, 1958

As for the criticism from the masses that cadres do not approach the masses, is it difficult to rectify? Compared to some of the issues mentioned earlier, it seems more complex. However, as long as we all make up our minds, improve our work methods, seriously streamline meetings, and go directly to the workers, peasants, soldiers, and intellectual masses to investigate, study, and solve problems, it would not be difficult. Moreover, once everyone goes down, stays with the masses, and gets a feel for it, long meetings will decrease. Necessary meetings will also be better prepared and more effective in solving problems. Old habits can be broken, and new habits and new customs can be cultivated. Is it not easy to change from having a stern face when meeting the masses? If two hands are stuck in the pockets, annoying people, just take them out. What difficulty is there in that?

Many problems in work, the execution of policies and guidelines, organizational structure problems, may be more complex. However, as long as we seriously study the directives from the Central Committee, consult with the masses on every matter, use our brains, take action, personally go down to inspect and summarize work, and conduct a serious comparative study of good and bad typical cases of the same nature, gaining direct experience in solving problems, not letting secretaries handle everything, and not relying on unreliable third-hand or fourth-hand materials to get by, half of the problems will be solved.

Some comrades say: This way of talking makes rectification seem too easy. In fact, it is not that rectification is easy, but that once you make up your mind, it becomes easy. As the saying goes, "There is no difficulty in the world, as long as there is a determined person." Things in the world are only difficult if you are not serious. Once you are serious, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. Taking out two hands from the pockets seems easy, but here it is actually a matter of mass relations. If you take an unserious attitude, just taking the hands out of the pockets, of course, the root problem is not solved. However, if you take a serious attitude, not only taking the hands out, but starting from here to seriously strengthen contact with the masses, the problem can be solved from the root. As for some problems that cannot be solved immediately due to lack of experience or conditions, as long as you take a serious attitude, you can gain experience and create conditions sooner.

In summary, the majority of problems can and must be solved by ourselves. The number of problems that need to be solved by the Central Committee is very few. Here, "ourselves" refers to cadres at all levels, including leaders of the Municipal Committee. As long as we make up our minds, we must dare to rectify, resolutely rectify, and thoroughly rectify.

Some comrades cannot make up their minds. One reason is that they mystify rectification. They have not sorted out the problems, analyzed them, but only feel that there are a lot of problems and do not know where to start. Another reason is that they fear difficulty, fear pain, fear the masses, and fear inviting trouble. The third reason is that they lack the spirit of selflessness that a Communist Party member should have, and are not convinced by the masses' criticism, thinking that what they did was right, only the method was wrong, and they have been labeled with so many big-character posters, which is really unfair. Therefore, some people want to use formalistic methods to carry out rectification to get through the rectification stage. However, this is doomed to fail. Past mistakes and errors have not been corrected, old debts have not been repaid, and new debts have been incurred. This debt is high-interest, "rolling over like a donkey," interest on interest, rolling bigger and bigger. We advise these comrades not to incur such debts. As long as you seriously analyze the opinions raised by the masses, you will have a "bottom" and confidence. As long as you take an honest and serious attitude towards the Party, the masses, and yourself, do not idolize yourself, and believe in the majority of the masses, it will be easier to make up your mind. With this determination, solving a batch of problems, our comrades will taste the sweetness of rectification, feel their spirits lifted, and realize that this lesson must be learned, and rectification must be done thoroughly.

Of course, contradictions are always present. Old contradictions are solved, and new contradictions arise. Problems always need to be solved continuously. However, this thorough rectification will gain experience, and next time when solving new problems, there will be more methods, more confidence, and it will be easier to make up your mind.

Having made up your mind, you must also have the correct methods. According to the experience of the advanced units, the correct method is still to seek truth from facts and follow the mass line.

Leaders of various units should sort out and analyze the opinions raised by the masses since the open criticism, and draw up an approximate plan, clarifying the steps of rectification. Due to the different problems in the open criticism of various units, the rectification plan and steps cannot be uniform. According to the situation of most units, since the problems of leadership style are more prominent, starting from rectifying the leadership style, starting from changing the sectarian phenomenon of special privileges and detachment from the masses, is more appropriate. On the one hand, the masses have the most opinions on this aspect, accounting for about 35% to 50% of the total opinions, rectifying it first can strongly demonstrate the leaders' determination to rectify themselves, and inspire the masses' enthusiasm to help the leaders rectify their style. On the other hand, this type of problem is not too complex, as long as there is determination, it is easy to rectify, and the effect is quick; at the same time, the problem of leadership style is a fundamental and key issue. If this problem is rectified well, many problems in the masses' work, study, and life will be solved accordingly. Experience has proven that as long as a batch of such problems is solved, the relationship between leaders and the led, between Party members and non-Party members, and between Party organizations and the masses will be greatly improved, and the political atmosphere of the entire unit will become lively and vibrant, creating a good condition for further rectification.

After dealing with a large number of leadership style problems, we can proceed to various specialized rectifications according to the problems existing in work and organization and the different situations of various units. For example, in conjunction with the transfer of cadres, strengthening the grassroots and weak links, we can first solve the organizational problems. In conjunction with the progress of work rectification, we can appropriately establish and improve democratic systems, expand democratic life. Matters related to organizational structure, those that can be solved by oneself should be solved first, and those involving the entire city and the Central Committee should be solved later. This specialized open criticism should aim to thoroughly understand each topic and can be appropriately interspersed.

For the criticism raised by the masses about waste, it must be taken seriously. Various departments, enterprises, schools, and organizations should set aside seven to ten days during the rectification process to conduct a specialized open criticism and rectification of waste phenomena, so that the policy of frugal construction can be truly implemented.

Having made up your mind and having a plan, you must also resolutely rely on the masses, not rectify by closing the door, but rectify under the participation and supervision of the masses. Some units only discuss with a few leading cadres, holding meetings every day, locking the door, making their heads dizzy, and not being able to sleep at night, but still not solving a few problems. When they change this method of detachment from the masses, consult with the masses, and everyone uses their brains together, they quickly solve the problems. Therefore, we must resolutely follow the mass line and not use bureaucratism to combat bureaucratism. To implement the mass line in rectification, leaders of each unit should report to the masses, announce the requirements and general plan of rectification, make self-criticisms on the shortcomings and errors of the leadership, explain the situation of rectification while working in the previous two stages, and call on the masses to actively criticize and participate in and supervise rectification. The rectification report should be seriously discussed at the Party Committee meeting. Differences of opinion between Party Committee members and between the Secretary and Party Committee members should be openly debated; otherwise, the report will be weak and powerless, unable to inspire the enthusiasm for rectification.

For problems that can be rectified immediately, they should be tackled in layers and batches immediately, and the rectification situation should be announced to the masses in a timely manner until the majority of the masses are satisfied. All party members and cadres who are criticized should make a public explanation to the masses.

Various rectification plans should not only be drafted on the basis of the masses' open criticism but also be executed under the repeated discussion and supervision of the masses. For the rectification of each problem, various forms such as big-character posters, discussion meetings, and debate meetings should be fully utilized. Various inspection teams and plan teams can be organized, attracting the masses to participate, combining the leadership with the masses, so that the plan can be more in line with reality, and if there are errors, it can be easier to correct.

The rectification stage is also a process of self-education and mutual education between leaders and the masses. In the rectification open criticism, what is correct, what is wrong, how to do it for the benefit of socialism, how to do it against the benefit of socialism, this is a test for both leaders and the masses. In one unit, when discussing the issue of eliminating special privileges, some people proposed the slogan that the housing of leading cadres should be strictly reduced according to the principle of egalitarianism. Through the masses' on-site investigation and realistic discussion, not only was the phenomenon of special privileges of a few people living in too many houses corrected, but also the egalitarianism thoughts of some people were corrected, which was more effective than the leaders' criticism of egalitarianism thoughts. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must insist on the mass line and learn to walk the mass line. It has been proven that units that fully implement the mass line have carried out rectification quickly and well.

Now, those who truly resist rectification are indeed a minority. For those comrades who are not determined to rectify and fear inviting trouble, we must urge them to enter the battlefield of intense struggle. For those who are arrogant and full of officialdom, we must resolutely urge them to correct themselves. For those who are not good at walking the mass line, we must help them conduct a realistic analysis. Especially for a few Party members who do not want to expose their shortcomings and errors, we must resolutely help them expose them. This is truly helping comrades and caring for comrades, promoting comrades' progress. We must understand: helping a comrade must help thoroughly, do not shield their mistakes. When they are not enlightened, you shield them, they will thank you; but when they suffer a big loss because of this, or when their enlightenment is raised, they will blame you for not helping them at that time. You help them expose the problem now, when they are not enlightened, they will blame you, thinking that you are making things difficult for them; but when they are enlightened because of this, they will thank you. We must not vulgarize comrade relationships.

During the rectification stage, various units must transfer a batch of cadres. The purpose is first to make cadres undergo labor tempering and gradually integrate with workers and peasants, second to strengthen the grassroots and weak links, and third to streamline the organization, making full use of manpower. These three purposes are unified and indivisible, all with great revolutionary significance. The most important thing is to make our cadres, after participating in physical labor tempering, have a complete labor outlook and mass outlook, and create a cadre team that is loyal to the laboring people and can withstand risks.

The above is about the emphasis on the rectification stage.

The whole-city rectification movement, according to the experience of advanced units, as long as it does not take detours, the time does not need to be dragged out too long. Therefore, the Municipal Committee believes that in units that have fully or partially launched the rectification movement, they should continue to deepen the movement according to the established policies and guidelines of the Central Committee on the rectification movement, and complete the rectification task with a beginning and an end. In units that have not yet launched the movement, they should actively prepare for the launch of the movement. Various units (excluding medical institutions) should, according to the sequence of launching the movement, sequentially complete the rectification task by 1958, no later than June.

The rectification movement in municipal and district organs should be carried out promptly, with the majority completing the rectification task by the end of February, and all completing it by the end of March, so as to free up hands to lead the rectification movement in factories, shops, and lanes, and to dispatch cadres from the already rectified municipal organs and large factories to form work teams to help them. We must pay attention to the rectification movement in grassroots units and must not, like in previous political movements, often leave out some small units, causing them to not receive socialist education.

The rectification task of colleges and universities, scientific research institutions, and secondary vocational schools should be completed no later than the end of May. The rectification movement in primary and secondary schools should be concentrated during the winter and summer vacations, and the winter vacation period can be appropriately extended if necessary. The socialist ideological education of private schools and supplementary schools should also be carried out from the first half of 1958.

The rectification and socialist education movement of the cultural, news, publishing, democratic parties, industrial and commercial circles, industrial workers, commercial workers, and the Han and minority nationalities' religious circles should be completed by the end of June 1958. The socialist education movement of municipal public transportation enterprises and institutions should be completed by the end of May 1958. The socialist education of peasants should strive to be completed by the end of March 1958, so as to timely transition to spring plowing production.

After this meeting, district committees should, according to the above deployment, comprehensively arrange the rectification movement of industrial, commercial, medical and health institutions, and primary and secondary schools in various districts. After the rectification in organs is basically completed, a portion of the forces should be allocated from March 1958 to start the socialist education work of lane residents, striving to basically complete the socialist education movement of lane residents by June.

The rectification of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai should be carried out according to the established plan.

Although the anti-rightist struggle in the whole city has achieved decisive victory, it has not yet been completely concluded. We must continue to carry out the anti-rightist struggle to the end and strive for a thorough victory. In units that have launched the anti-rightist struggle but have not yet achieved complete victory, they should, in conjunction with the third and fourth stages of work in the whole-people rectification movement, continue to deepen the anti-rightist struggle. All exposed rightists must be completely exposed, and rightists who have been exposed but have not yet admitted their guilt must be refuted and isolated. The anti-rightist struggle is a matter of life and death for the state, and our comrades must not be intoxicated by victory, relax their vigilance, and end the struggle hastily. While preventing the tendency of hasty conclusion and front tight and back loose, we must also prevent another tendency of abandoning the policy of presenting facts and reasoning, forming a tendency of simplifying the struggle method. In units that have started open criticism but have not yet discovered rightists, they must remain calm and must not be complacent. On the one hand, they should recognize that after the large exposure of this spring, even if some rightists are left, they will not be many. Some units, after a realistic and comprehensive analysis, if they indeed have not discovered rightists, they should not carry out the anti-rightist struggle. On the other hand, they should recognize that although the remaining rightists are not many and will not be able to emerge in large numbers like in the spring of 1957, rightists are not many does not mean there are none. Moreover, the class struggle situation is fluctuating and developing in twists and turns, rightists not emerging now does not mean they will never attack the Party in the future. So, they should not be careless and cultivate a sense of peace. In addition, the handling of rightists should also be discussed and properly resolved by the masses in the near future.

For the issues that need to be uniformly arranged by the whole city, such as system issues, streamlining organizations, transferring cadres, strengthening grassroots leadership, wage and welfare issues, implementing the "Outline for Agricultural Development in China (Revised Draft)," population issues, and other important issues, the Municipal Committee has prepared several reports and speeches based on opinions from all sides, to be discussed by the Representative Congress, and will not be repeated here.

The sign of the victory of the rectification movement is not only that rightists are isolated and split, and the shortcomings in our work are overcome, but also that the cadres of our Party must have more revolutionary will and higher class consciousness after rectification, making our work more vigorous and better.

We communists should have the highest class consciousness and the strongest revolutionary will. When capitalism seems very powerful, Marx and Engels saw the inevitable doom of the bourgeoisie and the victory of the proletariat, saw that in the socialist revolution, the proletariat would only lose a chain from their necks and gain the whole world. They fought for revolution with bare hands and unyielding spirit throughout their lives. When Lenin and his comrades decided to realize the proletarian revolution in Russia and build a socialist society, they were only a small group of communists, but by 1917, they led the great October Revolution, creating the first socialist country in the world. When China was in the darkest reactionary rule, Chinese communists declared the establishment of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai, declaring that communism would inevitably triumph in China. When Chiang Kai-shek was madly slaughtering revolutionary people, thinking that his throne was secure, our Communist Party of China raised the banner of victory on Jinggangshan. At that time, how many people ridiculed Marx and Engels, ridiculed Lenin, ridiculed Chinese communists, saying they were "dreaming in broad daylight." The development of history has proven that those who were ridiculed were not the communists, but those who thought that capitalism would last forever. We communists advocate seeking truth from facts. The result of seeking truth from facts is that the victory of communism is the law of historical development, and no one can stop the world from transitioning to communism. Therefore, our revolutionary will is not based on fantasy but on the reliable foundation of scientific communism. Because we link our personal fate with the great cause of communism, we communists despise bourgeois individualism. Our Party members are not ordinary people but advanced warriors of the conscious proletariat. They should become representatives of class interests and class consciousness, and therefore their personal interests should not stand out above the interests of the Party and the class. Therefore, we communists are always optimists, and our revolutionary will is always strong and indomitable. In class struggle, in war, when it is time to sacrifice oneself, we face death bravely; in fighting against nature, in construction, we want to make mountains bow down and rivers yield. This is the manifestation of our communists' strong revolutionary will.

In general, the revolutionary will of the Shanghai Party organization is strong and has fighting spirit. However, from the situation exposed in the rectification movement, it cannot be said that the revolutionary will of all our cadres is strong. According to rough analysis, the situation of cadres is as follows:

The first type of people have a strong revolutionary will. They work hard, strive for progress, and study diligently in their work. They can closely connect with the masses in complex environments, use their brains, investigate and study, research problems, think deeply, fear no difficulties, work hard, and are full of initiative and creativity. In places where such cadres are in charge, the work will definitely be vigorous and develop rapidly, although there are also shortcomings and errors, but they are relatively easy to overcome. There, the growth of cadres and active elements is also relatively fast.

The second type of people can work and do not want to do bad things, but lack the spirit of striving for progress and tenacious struggle. Their characteristic is that they can generally complete the tasks given by the Party, but they are conservative and rarely innovative. In work, they do not pay enough attention to politics, and thus lack a strong political driving force. These comrades often do not want to or do not know how to think of ways to do things that can be done with effort, and when they encounter difficulties, they think they "cannot do it" and do not do it. Among them, there are intellectuals who think they have knowledge and do not actively strive to integrate with the workers and peasants. Among them, there are also comrades from worker and peasant backgrounds who have low cultural levels but do not actively strive to study. Among them, there are also old cadres who have a certain amount of fighting experience and work ability, but because of this, they are arrogant and think they are almost there, and do not actively strive to improve their abilities. Some of them sometimes realize their backwardness, have some frustrations, but lack the determination to work hard. Therefore, in places where they are in charge of work, work improvement is slow, and their own progress is also slow.

The third type of people have heavier individualist baggage and their thoughts have started to decay. They still want to do revolutionary work, but they either think they are old-timers, or think they have merits, or although they are not old-timers, they think they have special abilities, often putting personal interests first and the Party and people's interests last. They look down on the masses, thinking they are superior, and have a lot of officialdom. They consider problems often with personal gains and losses as the standard. Some people, as long as there is an opportunity, will compete for fame and profit, and will be happy if they get some, and will have bad moods if they do not get any. These people, when facing work, are infected with "officialdom," do things by the book, talk nonsense, are very interested in their personal problems, but are indifferent to political problems, work problems, and the people's sufferings, as if they are not worth their serious attention. They sometimes are also very active, but mostly with personal gains and losses as the standard. Individualist decay, sometimes exposed to the sun, such as through the Party and masses' criticism and education, will be less; if the Party and masses' supervision is slightly relaxed, it will continue to develop. Therefore, if they do not make up their minds to correct their shortcomings and errors, they will have the danger of no longer being able to continue as Communist Party members.

The above three situations are only the most prominent manifestations. The first and second types of situations account for the majority of our comrades, and the third type of situation, although there is a certain number, only accounts for a minority. Of course, there are also people who sometimes progress and sometimes fall behind, fluctuating between the two situations, not very stable. We analyze the situation in this way only to facilitate the explanation of the situation. We hope that more comrades will make efforts, progress continuously, and everyone will become a person with a strong revolutionary will.

In addition, the rectification movement also exposed some rightist elements within the Party, bad elements who infiltrated the Party, serious lawbreakers, incorrigible corrupt elements, elements with serious bourgeois individualist thoughts and behaviors who are unrepentant, and elements who are rotten in thought and politics. They are indeed people who are rotten in thought and politics, and they have no Party spirit, no matter what they have, they do not have communism. In their eyes, they owe nothing to anyone, but it is the Party and the people who owe them a hundred times over. They often act recklessly, using various opportunities to harm the interests of the Party and the people. Although such people account for a very small number in the Party, they often cause great harm. With the help of the broad masses, the Party has exposed and expelled these bad elements from the Party, which is an important achievement of the rectification movement.

The situation of the Party's cadres shows: our country is in a period of great social change, and the struggle to transform the old society inevitably reflects within the Party. In society, there is the problem of passing through the socialist phase, and in our Party, there is also the problem of passing through the socialist phase. Those rightist elements and other bad elements cannot pass through this phase, which has been proven by facts; other comrades, such as those whose thoughts have started to decay, whether they can pass through this phase is also a question worth their consideration.

The vast majority of the Party's cadres are loyal to the Party and the people, and they have long been determined to struggle for the cause of communism to the end. Among them, many have undergone long-term tempering and testing in struggle, and their performance in the socialist revolutionary period is also good. They have relatively sufficient spiritual preparation for passing through the socialist phase. However, it cannot be said that all Party members have sufficient spiritual preparation for passing through the socialist phase. Some people, they were originally bad people who infiltrated the Party, and they only wanted to pass through the phase, but now they have been exposed and cannot pass through. There are also some people, they originally joined the Party with an attitude of agreeing with our Party's democratic revolutionary program, but when they finished the democratic revolutionary phase with the Party, they did not want to advance. There are some comrades who have accepted the socialist revolutionary program, but due to arrogance and complacency, they do not seriously study the Central Committee's policies and guidelines, do not approach the laboring masses, do not approach grassroots work, and their ideological and work levels are always not improved. In the great waves of revolution, they sometimes are intoxicated by victory, sometimes are frightened by victory. There are also some people who cannot withstand the corruption of bourgeois ideology in new conditions, becoming captives of bourgeois individualism, bourgeois conspiracies, and bourgeois lifestyles.

It cannot be said that the Party has not issued warnings about this phenomenon. The Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have long pointed out that the socialist phase is not easy to pass through. As early as the eve of the victory of the people's democratic revolution in 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong warned us at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee to prevent being defeated by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The enemy cannot defeat us, this has been proven. The flattery of the bourgeoisie may defeat the weak-willed in our ranks. There may be some communists who have not been defeated by the enemy with guns, who are not ashamed of the title of hero in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of bullets wrapped in sugar, they will be defeated by sugar bullets." Comrade Mao Zedong's words, although they were said about the flattery of the bourgeoisie after the national victory, the actual meaning is to point out that the historical phase of socialism is about to come, compared to the historical phase of the bourgeois democratic revolution, it is a more serious test for quite a few comrades. Because in the historical phase of the socialist revolution, the opponents we encounter are the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie can not only use sugar bullets and conspiracies to defeat some people in our ranks, but also can, through its extensive social relations, through its alliance with the upper layer of the petty bourgeoisie and some people in the broad petty bourgeoisie who have not yet awakened, surround our Party, through the influence of bourgeois individualism and bourgeois lifestyles in society, through the attack and corruption of rightist elements and other bad elements within the Party, defeat the weak-willed in our ranks, defeat those communists who are not firm in politics.

Everyone knows that the current international environment and domestic conditions, in general, are conducive to our building a socialist power within about fifteen years. Even the British Times newspaper has to admit that Britain will fall behind us in less than fifteen years. However, things in the world need people to do them. After the objective conditions are met, the key to success and failure lies in subjective initiative. This is the reason why we do not hesitate to spend a lot of time discussing the issue of revolutionary will. We communists must be promoters of the socialist cause, not retarders. Therefore, we must always overcome the infiltration of bourgeois individualism, maintain a strong revolutionary will, and contribute everything to the socialist cause, strive to be a good Party member who is worthy of the glorious title of a communist. For this, we believe that the following measures are completely necessary.

First, we must, through the rectification movement and daily work, seriously strengthen the political and ideological education of Party members and cadres.

To enable all cadres to successfully pass through the socialist phase, except for traitors and serious lawbreakers, the Party must protect all Party and Youth League members in the rectification movement, and use great effort and sincerity to help them correct their shortcomings and errors. We must educate all Party members and cadres to definitely have vitality, definitely have a strong revolutionary will, definitely have a spirit of selflessness and wholeheartedly serving the people. For all Party and Youth League members, we must help them improve their work methods, improve their work abilities, and improve their ideological and political levels. That is to say, we must make all our comrades undergo another profound and practical socialist tempering, to meet the needs of the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

In the current emphasis on rectification stage and the upcoming fourth stage, we must focus on combating bureaucratism, sectarianism (including localism and departmentalism), and subjectivism, and at the same time, thoroughly criticize rightist thoughts, criticize individualism, liberalism, anarchism, and egalitarianism, criticize nationalism. For Party members whose revolutionary will is waning and who are passive and backward, they must also be severely criticized, and serious cases must be disciplined. For rightist elements and other bad elements within the Party, they must be dealt with seriously according to the principles and procedures specified by the Central Committee, the same as rightist elements and other bad elements outside the Party. However, for all those who are punished, we must still care for them and help them progress.

In summary, in this rectification, every Party member must undergo a thorough self-examination politically and ideologically. The whole-people rectification movement has been proven in practice to be the best method for mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses to carry out self-education and self-reform. In the future, we should follow the Central Committee's instructions to carry out rectification every year or every two years, so as to ensure that our Party is always under the supervision of the broad masses, never detaches from the masses, never detaches from reality, and always advances vigorously.

However, we know that the transitional period is a period of great change, and the development of the revolutionary situation is changing day by day and month by month. The political and ideological situation of cadres is also constantly changing. Therefore, in addition to relying on the rectification movement, it is more important to seriously grasp the political and ideological education of cadres in daily life. We should seriously organize all cadres to study current affairs, study the Party's major policies and guidelines, and must deeply carry out debates to help cadres deeply understand the current political direction and grasp the spirit and essence of the Party's major policies and guidelines; we should guide cadres (especially leading cadres at all levels) to mainly use their remaining energy to study Marxism-Leninism and enrich their scientific and cultural knowledge; we should assist leading cadres to set aside a certain amount of work time each year to visit advanced work units, exchange experiences with neighboring provinces and regions, so as to gain vivid practical work knowledge, expand their horizons, and broaden their minds. Wherever political life is not healthy, it must be made healthy; wherever discipline is lax, it must be strengthened; wherever the composition is impure, the grassroots Party organizations must be rectified.

Second, we must make all Party cadres, especially leading cadres, closely connect with the grassroots masses and the actual struggle, so as to constantly transform their subjective world. In the future, in addition to continuing to select cadres from among outstanding elements from workers and peasants according to the Central Committee's instructions, we should also select cadres from intellectuals who have undergone production tempering and have close ties with the laboring masses. According to the principle of "comprehensive tempering and unified arrangement," cadres at all levels must undergo tempering through physical labor and actual struggle, gain grassroots work experience, and those who lack this course must make up for it. Cadres who have not undergone tempering through physical labor and actual struggle and lack grassroots work experience, whether they are intellectual cadres or other cadres, should go to the countryside, factories to work for a few years, or go to the grassroots to work for a few years, truly integrating with the workers and peasants.

It should be emphasized that this is a major revolutionary measure. Only by seriously implementing this policy can we build a cadre team that fights for communism and can withstand risks. We believe that the majority of transferred cadres can temper themselves well, and they will also help Party outsiders to temper themselves well. However, we should also make it clear to the transferred cadres that going to the countryside, going to the grassroots to temper oneself is a revolution in one's thoughts for each comrade, without sufficient revolutionary consciousness and a firm determination to transform oneself, the expected results cannot be achieved. Most people go down voluntarily, they eagerly want to go down, and after obtaining approval, they happily invest in the hot physical labor and actual struggle, invest in the broad masses. But there are also some people who are not completely voluntary, or go down with some incorrect thoughts. For example: "After all, the salary is still paid, go down for a few years to gild oneself and then come back." We say: going down can temper people, but the result depends to a great extent on one's revolutionary consciousness, revolutionary determination, and revolutionary perseverance. We believe that the majority can make great progress in tempering, but there are also a few people, if they do not make up their minds to seriously correct their faults, they will not only not be able to "come back after a few years," but will also lose their qualifications as cadres. We should take various measures to strengthen the political and ideological education of transferred cadres, help them, so that all comrades who go down will have a firm determination, and temper themselves into vigorous communist warriors. Not only for those who have already gone down, but also for those who will go down in the future, we should do this, we should be responsible for them and absolutely not allow them to be neglected.

In-service cadres must also solve the problem of re-tempering themselves. In addition to adopting the method of taking turns to go down for labor tempering, for in-service cadres, we should also set out some methods to make them participate in physical labor on their work posts, approach reality, and approach the grassroots. Therefore, the Municipal Committee believes that it should first stipulate: each leading cadre, including leaders of the Municipal Committee, should spend four months each year to go deep into the grassroots, connect with the masses, connect with reality, directly help the subordinates, and gain experience. Half a year, going down for two months each time or going down for four months at once or going down for two days each week are all possible, but it must be a fixed system and must be strictly implemented. The system of leading cadres not holding meetings on Thursday, going to the grassroots to work and participating in a part of physical labor, except for a few special cases, must be adhered to. The responsible comrades of various organs, schools, troops, and enterprises must establish a system of regularly connecting with the grassroots, regularly understanding their situation, studying their work, and helping them think of ways to solve problems when they encounter difficulties.

Third, we must gradually make the majority of cadres achieve "both red and expert," becoming red experts. Red refers to politics, and expert refers to business. Politics and business are a unity of opposites. But politics is the commander, politics should command business; politics is also the guarantee of business, the superstructure serves the economic base. Only being an expert without being red, without correct political views, is like having no soul. Only paying attention to business, not paying attention to politics, only knowing how to calculate, not talking about ideology, only focusing on the material base, not carrying out socialist education, will lose direction and become a captive of bourgeois ideology. Therefore, we must criticize the tendency of not asking about politics, and make all business cadres pay attention to politics, not become economic experts or technical experts who lose direction. At the same time, we must also criticize the tendency of not studying business, and make all cadres strive to study business, strive to become experts in business, not become empty politicians. We need a large cadre team that is both red and expert. Otherwise, the struggle between the two roads on many business issues, the question of who will defeat whom between capitalism and socialism, will be difficult to truly solve. Now some comrades think they have already become red, or have already become experts, or have already become both red and expert, but in fact, being both red and expert has no end. Once you are complacent, you will retreat. Our comrades must have revolutionary ambition, invigorate their spirits, work hard, study Marxism, study politics, study science and culture, study business, not for the sake of pursuing personal fame and wealth, but for the cause of the proletariat. Forts are to be attacked, time is to be squeezed out. In addition to going to school for further studies, it mainly relies on on-the-job learning. Each department should make a plan, aiming to cultivate a large number of red experts who are both red and expert within ten years, so as to truly establish and further consolidate the leadership of the proletariat on various fronts.

Fourth, we must also ensure the organization of cadres' enthusiasm and creativity. With the great strides forward of the construction cause, the power that should be delegated must be resolutely delegated, so that the majority of cadres can work boldly and actively. Some management systems that seem to need to be changed or abolished now must be resolutely changed, so that the majority of cadres can dare to work with all their might. In the future, Party organizations at all levels should, according to the principle of unified leadership and division of responsibilities indicated by the Central Committee, improve our organizational work and formulate corresponding work systems to adapt to the rapid development of the socialist construction cause.

The Central Committee pointed out: the basic task of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people in the next ten to fifteen years is, on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, to implement the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and build China into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. In fifteen years, the Soviet Union's industry in the most important products and output may catch up with or surpass the United States. China should strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the same period in the output of steel and other important industrial products. In that way, the socialist world will far surpass the imperialist countries.

The call from the Central Committee has greatly inspired the whole Party and the people of the whole country, and has greatly inspired the men and women workers, laborers, and people of all walks of life in Shanghai. A new production upsurge and a scientific and cultural construction upsurge have already arrived.

In order to further mobilize and organize the strength of the whole Party and the people of Shanghai on the basis of the whole-people rectification movement, unite all forces that can be united, and strive to complete the second five-year plan ahead of schedule and exceed the target, achieve the above-mentioned great goals, the Municipal Committee specially proposes the following twelve tasks, calling on the Party organizations at all levels in Shanghai, all Party members, Young Pioneers, and the people of Shanghai to realize them with unprecedented political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm:

First, vigorously develop industrial production. (1) The total industrial output value of Shanghai should increase by more than 100% at the end of the second five-year plan compared to the end of the first five-year plan. (2) In a planned and step-by-step manner, carry out the technological and organizational transformation of Shanghai's industry, on the one hand, retain the advantages of existing enterprises (simplicity, flexibility, etc.), and on the other hand, gradually adopt new technologies, reasonably adjust the organization, and make Shanghai develop into a modern industrial base for chemical industry, precision machinery, instruments, telecommunications equipment, small steel materials, shipbuilding and repair, high-level products of light textile industry, various cultural products and cultural refined products. (3) The general light industry, textile industry, mechanical and electrical industry, and chemical industry departments should, according to specific conditions, strive to gradually catch up with or surpass the quality level of similar products in Britain or the United States in the second and third five-year plans for some quality-lower main products. (4) Strengthen the leadership of basic construction, mobilize all forces, and strive to complete and put into production on time. We must follow the frugal construction policy, oppose waste, and ensure the quality of the project. (5) Implement the principles of democratic management and frugal management, continue to rectify and consolidate handicraft cooperatives, and actively develop handicrafts that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood and have a broad foreign market. (6) Improve and develop the transportation industry to better serve production. (7) Strengthen the leadership of labor force allocation work. The growth of industrial production in the second five-year plan mainly relies on the improvement of labor productivity of existing employees and the rational allocation of labor force. The employees needed for new enterprises should be transferred from industries with surplus labor. Most industries should strengthen technical and organizational measures to fully utilize the existing labor force.

Second, strive for the early realization of the "Outline for Agricultural Development in China (Revised Draft)." This great program, not only will make China's agricultural production leap forward, and farmers' lives more prosperous, but will also strongly promote the rapid development of industry. The Shanghai Party organization and the people of Shanghai should: (1) Under the overall arrangement of the Central Committee, develop industrial production, improve commercial work, supply agricultural production with beautiful and cheap agricultural tools, fertilizers, water conservancy equipment, and daily necessities; strengthen scientific research work, allocate manpower, and support the agricultural production of the whole country. (2) Make full use of Shanghai's favorable conditions to strive to basically realize the tasks specified in the "Outline for Agricultural Development in China (Revised Draft)" in the second five-year plan in the suburbs of Shanghai. Among them, the grain and cotton production, under normal weather conditions, should greatly exceed the targets specified in the outline. Strive to achieve an average annual production of 1,500 to 2,000 jin per mu of grain and 150 to 200 jin per mu of cotton skin within five years. In 1958, we should focus on afforestation to strive for the greening of urban and suburban areas as soon as possible. We should make the coastal areas green in patches and the urban and suburban areas green in lines. The mechanization and electrification of suburban agriculture should also be planned as soon as possible to strive for early realization. (3) Urban and suburban people should support each other, help each other, and strive to build a prosperous and happy socialist new countryside in the suburbs of Shanghai ahead of schedule, and gradually improve the supply of vegetables and other sideline products for urban residents.

Third, practice thrift and oppose waste. (1) For the financial allocation of various departments, 5% should be deducted in advance according to the budget and handed over to the state, requiring 95% of the money to do what 100% of the money can do. (2) The bonus of enterprises should be used appropriately, and the surplus at the end of the year should not be spent recklessly. (3) Strengthen the financial management of factories and enterprises, streamline non-production personnel, reduce management costs, lower production costs, and strive to exceed the state revenue plan, accumulate more construction funds for the state, and support the socialist construction of the whole country with greater strength. (4) Promote the spirit of frugal construction and frugal household management to every factory, enterprise, cooperative, organ, school, and every household, and cultivate a new social custom. From doing the biggest business to personal red and white celebrations, frugality should be considered glorious.

Fourth, strengthen economic cooperation with neighboring provinces. In terms of technology, funds, etc., support the development of small coal, iron, and non-ferrous metal mines in various places, develop mountainous areas, establish some light industrial raw material and sideline product bases, improve the supply of industrial raw materials and sideline products for Shanghai industry, and promote the common prosperity of the economy.

Fifth, continue to complete the socialist transformation, consolidate and expand the socialist united front. Continue to implement the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," strengthen the left wing, consolidate the leadership of the middle elements, isolate and split the right wing.

Continue to help intellectuals through the path of self-education and self-reform to gradually achieve the following initial goals: one, support the leadership of the Communist Party; two, firmly and actively take the socialist road; three, gradually integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers; four, correctly handle the contradictions between personal interests and collective interests, national interests; five, strive to study politics, actively study business, and continuously seek progress. Through the above work, strive to make the left-wing and left-center intellectuals among high-level intellectuals account for more than 60% within five years.

Thoroughly complete the socialist transformation of capitalist ownership, strengthen the transformation of capitalist elements based on enterprises. The interest distribution system of joint state-private enterprises must be abolished in a timely manner according to the regulations of the Central Committee; the serious capitalist management tendencies existing in some consignment and agency households must be corrected; illegal underground workshops must be banned; workshops needed by the state must be registered; the spontaneous small merchant and peddler teams must be rectified; the illegal behaviors of some capitalist elements, such as speculation, lawlessness, and disorder, must be cleaned up. Through serious and regular ideological education work, gradually solve a series of major political problems such as capitalist elements truly accepting the leadership of the Party, taking the socialist road, accepting workers' supervision, accepting labor tempering, gradually changing their lifestyle, and gradually narrowing the gap between their living standards and the laboring masses, so that they can be transformed into truly self-reliant laborers in the transitional period to socialism.

Sixth, flourish science and culture, and strive to cultivate a large team of proletarian intellectuals within ten years. (1) Strive to basically universalize primary education and eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people within five years. (2) Within five years, all universities, middle and primary schools, and other cultural institutions should have strong leadership cores. (3) Within ten years, the proportion of workers and peasants in universities should reach more than 70%, and good laboring youths should be given priority in enrollment. (4) Organize writers to go to the countryside and factories in a planned manner. Actively develop cultural and artistic activities among workers and peasants, cultivate worker and peasant correspondents, and cultivate amateur writers, actors, musicians, painters, and other cultural workers among the worker and peasant masses. (5) Continue to implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," carry out academic research activities, improve the quality of school teaching, and improve the level of scientific research. (6) Strive to cultivate a group of red and expert technical cadres, scientists, writers, artists, editors, reporters, professors, teachers, and Marxist theorists (including all intellectuals who have truly transformed and stood on the proletarian position from the old society) within ten years. Special attention should be paid to actively helping old cadres with a basic foundation to work hard to study. Strive to cultivate 300 social science workers with actual fighting experience and at least the level of university lecturer within five years.

Seventh, carry out the patriotic hygiene movement centered on the elimination of four pests. The task of eliminating four pests in Shanghai is actually eliminating seven pests. Strive to basically eliminate mosquitoes, flies, rats, sparrows, bedbugs, cockroaches, and snails in the urban and suburban areas of Shanghai within three years, and completely eliminate them within five years, and maintain this until future generations. In areas with conditions in the city, 1958 should completely eliminate them. At the same time, make every household pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene, strengthen medical prevention, develop sports, develop the medical industry, strive to eradicate schistosomiasis, malaria, hookworm disease, and filariasis ahead of schedule, and improve the health level of the people. At the same time, strengthen the struggle against various diseases and pests that seriously harm livestock and crops, and strive to eliminate diseases and pests as soon as possible.

Eighth, based on the spirit of starting from six hundred million people and considering all factors, gradually improve the living standards of the majority of workers on the basis of developing production, according to the indicators specified by the state. Strengthen the planning work of municipal construction, gradually improve it according to the principle of making do with what is available. For the problem of housing shortage in the whole city, adopt appropriate adjustments, make full use of it, correct the phenomenon of light and heavy rent, and ban the behavior of not paying rent and living in houses. Dispersing a part of the population that does not need to live in the city, restoring a part of the houses destroyed by previous wars, etc., gradually seek a reasonable solution. According to the principle of spending less money and doing more things, reasonably use the existing welfare funds, and strengthen the work of workers' families, rely on the strength of the masses, gradually improve workers' welfare undertakings.

Ninth, appropriately arrange the surplus labor force in Shanghai, actively encourage Shanghai youth and those who want to work to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor. In the suburbs of Shanghai, establish satellite towns, disperse some small enterprises, so as to reduce the excessive concentration of the urban population. Promote planned birth control, strengthen population management, and strive to limit the population of Shanghai to around seven million.

Tenth, strengthen the dictatorship over the enemy. Be ruthless to any rebellion. Those who commit crimes after being released from prison should be caught and sentenced again. For social hoodlums, triads, prostitutes, thieves, murderers, rapists, embezzlers, and those who seriously disrupt social order and seriously violate laws and regulations, as well as those who are generally considered bad people, they must be punished.

Gambling should be banned, yellow publications should be eliminated, and the influence of triads and all bad influences left over from the old society should be completely eliminated. Strengthen communist moral education to achieve the goal of changing customs.

Eleventh, strengthen the political and military training of the troops stationed in Shanghai, further strengthen the relationship between officers and soldiers and between the military and the people, establish and implement the system of troops participating in local activities regularly, consolidate national defense, and protect socialist construction.

Twelfth, streamline organizations, adjust structures. Strengthen grassroots organizations, further give play to the roles of trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and women's organizations. Establish and improve democratic systems under the leadership of the Party Committee, such as workers' congresses, cooperative members' congresses, and students' congresses. Mobilize all forces, organize the upsurge of production and construction and the upsurge of learning culture and technology, and struggle to build a new socialist Shanghai.

The Municipal Committee and Party organizations at all levels should, after this Party Representative Congress determines the above policies and tasks, draw up plans for industry, handicrafts, agriculture, sideline production, transportation, commerce (including prices), science, education, health (including the elimination of seven pests), finance (including finance), labor and wages (including population), municipal construction (including greening), etc. for 1958 and the next five years, from rough to fine, and improve them every half year, gradually achieving perfection.

Comrades of the Congress!

We are in a great era of transition from capitalism to socialism in the world. Now, the world situation is entering a new turning point: the strength of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, not only in terms of people's hearts, population, and rapid development, but also in some of the most important scientific and technological aspects, has definitely surpassed the strength of the imperialist camp led by the United States. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, now it is the east wind prevailing over the west wind, not the west wind prevailing over the east wind.

In such a new situation, we have a common feeling: it is very glorious to be a communist warrior. However, as the Central Committee teaches us, the great achievements we have made are only the first step of the ten-thousand-li long march. To advance our cause to the final victory, we still need to continue to solve the problem of which class and which road will win. In this situation, the responsibility of the Party's leadership and the responsibility of Communist Party members are undoubtedly greater.

To achieve the tasks we face, there are two methods: one is to do things faster and better, and the other is to do things slower and worse. Which method should we adopt? The facts have proven: more and more comrades have adopted the former method and rejected the latter method. We believe: after a thorough discussion at this meeting, more comrades will be full of revolutionary enthusiasm, correctly implement the policy of building socialism with more, faster, better, and more economical efforts, and accelerate the pace of building a new socialist Shanghai. After this meeting, the tasks proposed by our congress will be further discussed by Party organizations at all levels, and will be further discussed by the broad masses. Their boundless wisdom will be gathered, becoming boundless strength, and will surely promote the cause of building a new socialist Shanghai to make even greater strides.

There is a famous saying in China, "Riding the wind and breaking the waves." I think this phrase can be used to describe our current situation and tasks. There are waves in front of us, which are the various difficulties we will inevitably encounter in the construction of socialism. However, there is wind behind us, which is the ever-increasing revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad Party members and the masses. This is a wind with limitless potential, an irresistible wind. As long as we resolutely rely on the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, we will definitely be able to overcome any difficulties on our way forward. Let us advance bravely with the revolutionary spirit of riding the wind and breaking the waves! We will definitely accelerate the construction of a new socialist Shanghai, definitely complete all the tasks assigned by the Central Committee, and definitely make greater contributions to the cause of building a powerful socialist motherland. Victory will definitely be ours!

    乘风破浪，加速建设社会主义的新上海！
    ——1957年12月25日在中共上海市第一届代表大会第二次会议上的报告——
    柯庆施
    编者按：柯庆施同志的这个报告，虽然大部分是关于上海的情况和问题，但是这些情况和问题的性质，特别是报告的第一部分和第四部分，是具有普遍意义的。柯庆施同志在报告的第一部分中，根据党中央的指示，对于国内的主要矛盾，对于人民内部矛盾及其正确的处理，都作了详细的分析和阐明。这一部分中还谈到了对1956年工作的评价，批判了那种认为1956年各项工作都“冒进”了的错误的说法，说明了多、快、好、省勤俭建国的方针的正确性。这是值得大家重视的。报告的第四部分分析了党内干部的思想状况，提出了发扬革命朝气，打掉官气，实行劳动锻炼、深入基层、联系群众的制度，以及培养又红又专的红色专家等重要措施。代表同志们！
    根据代表大会所通过的议程，我们这次会议的主要议题是讨论目前我们工作中的形势，讨论和决定上海党组织如何整顿作风、改进工作的问题。
    一
    关于国内外的形势，党中央经常给我们作出全面的分析。在这次会议上，周恩来同志作了“世界形势和整风任务”的政治报告，使我们对形势、对全局有了进一步的认识。我们做各种工作都要看一看全局。全国有全国的全局，全市有全市的全局，一个部门、一个单位也都有各自的全局。懂得了全局，才能心中有数，不致迷失方向。我们有些同志往往不经常注意形势，不注意全局，不注意对事物进行全面的分析。有时看到成绩，看不到缺点；有时看到缺点，又看不到成绩；对成绩和缺点，有时又分不清主次。为了使整改进行得好，也需要先看看全局。因此，我们有必要先来谈谈形势，特别是过去一个时期发生过争论的一些问题。
    首先，我们谈谈国内的主要矛盾问题。
    这个问题，中央已经作过明确指示。但是，过去一个时期，我们一部分同志被资产阶级右派分子刮起来的一阵妖风吹昏了头脑，对于党提出的正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针发生了怀疑，好像党的某些基本政策是右了。这一股风虽然不很大，但很值得注意。
    大家知道：在中华人民共和国成立以前，中国人民同帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三大敌人的矛盾是主要矛盾。在中华人民共和国成立以后，开始了我国的过渡时期，上面说的这个主要矛盾在国内基本上解决了。资产阶级同无产阶级的矛盾、社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，成了国内的主要矛盾。1956年初达到高潮的资本主义工商业、农业、手工业三大改造运动，标志着我国经济战线上（在生产资料所有制方面）的社会主义革命取得了决定性胜利，无产阶级同资产阶级在这方面的矛盾基本上解决了。但是，社会主义革命是经济上、政治上、思想上最彻底、最深刻、最广泛的革命；所有制的基本改变，不但还没有完全解决经济战线上的问题（所有制还没有完全改变，社会主义的物质基础即社会主义的现代工业和现代农业的发展还很不充分），尤其还没有完全解决政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命问题。在我们党的第八次全国代表大会所通过的党章的总纲里，就着重地指出：党仍然面对着“彻底消灭剥削制度，并且杜绝产生剥削制度的根源”的严重任务，仍然面对着“继续注意从经济方面、政治方面和思想方面克服资本主义的因素和影响”的严重任务。因此，阶级斗争还没有结束，社会主义同资本主义谁战胜谁的问题还没有完全解决，斗争还是长时期的、曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。无产阶级同资产阶级的矛盾，社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，在整个过渡时期，仍然是国内的主要矛盾。不过在所有制基本改变以前，这种矛盾突出地表现在生产关系同生产力之间，即生产资料的私人所有制限制着社会生产力的发展；而在所有制基本改变以后，两个阶级、两条道路之间的矛盾就突出地表现在上层建筑同经济基础之间，即资产阶级的政治活动和资产阶级的意识形态同社会主义的社会制度不相适应，一部分资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子在政治战线上和思想战线上还不承认无产阶级的领导权，甚至还企图夺取这种领导权，从而破坏社会主义的社会制度。
    在我国目前的具体条件下，两个阶级、两条道路之间的这个矛盾，在某些范围内表现为敌我矛盾，在其他范围内则表现为人民内部的矛盾，而且大量地表现为人民内部的矛盾，只有在少数情况下才表现为敌我矛盾。旧的地主、富农、反革命分子，他们同人民的矛盾当然是敌我矛盾，但是他们在人民群众中已经彻底孤立了。还有一些政治资本的反社会主义力量是资产阶级的一部分，即尚未被揭发出来的资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子里头的右派分子。他们同无产阶级的矛盾也是敌我矛盾。但是不论是在全国人民中，或是在资产阶级中，他们也只占极少数。当他们一旦暴露出自己的反社会主义面貌，他们很快就陷于广大人民的包围之中。至于资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子的多数（中间派），对于所有制的改变和无产阶级的领导虽然也不完全心服，但是一般说来，他们还是倾向于接受社会主义道路和无产阶级领导的，他们同无产阶级的矛盾一般地表现为人民内部的矛盾。不论就全国来看，或是就上海这个资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子比较集中的地方来看，情况都是这样。
    我们可以举出两个摆在眼前的现实例子，证明党中央对基本形势所作的分析的正确。一个例子是：这次党所领导的上海工商界的反右派斗争，主要是由工商界自己进行的。第一批六千人，经过一个时期的学习，提高了认识，学会了大鸣大放、摆事实、讲道理的方法，在进入反右派斗争阶段以后，揭露出右派分子248人，整个工作做得很不坏。目前运动正逐步推广到整个工商界去。另一个例子是：复旦大学六百多个教师中，剥削阶级家庭出身的占60％，上层小资产阶级家庭出身的占34.5％，工农家庭出身的只有4.5％，但是，在政治上，左派加中左分子却占44％（这个比例在全市是比较高的，一般大学占30％左右），右派只占8.5％。这两个例子难道还不能说明，就以商学两界而论，近几年来，特别是近两年来，他们的改造工作做得还不坏，他们自我改造的成绩是显著的吗？这难道还不能说明情况已经发生了有利于无产阶级、有利于社会主义的变化吗？难道还不能说明他们的大多数经过教育是可以进步的，认为他们同劳动人民之间的矛盾属于人民内部矛盾是完全正确的吗？
    我们有些同志不去认真研究党中央和毛泽东同志的教导，即是在我国的具体条件下，如果我们处理得当，如果资产阶级接受无产阶级的政策，无产阶级同资产阶级的对抗性矛盾可以转变为非对抗性矛盾。他们看不见国内阶级关系的巨大变化，不认真研究周围事物的新发展，把自己的思想固定化了。他们错误地把我国无产阶级同资产阶级的矛盾、社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争一概看作敌我矛盾，把不属于右派的资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子的中间派对社会主义的动摇和不满也看作敌我矛盾，企图用处理敌我矛盾的方法来处理这些矛盾，而不懂得必须用不同的方法处理不同性质的矛盾，必须根据新的情况采取新的形式来处理阶级斗争的必要。
    当然，看不到敌我矛盾是完全错误和非常危险的。既然敌我矛盾还存在，否认或者忽视敌我斗争，把两个阶级、两条道路的斗争中所包含的一部分敌我矛盾，即我们和右派之间的斗争，也看作人民内部的矛盾，就要犯右倾错误。由于阶级关系时而尖锐（例如当资产阶级右派猖狂进攻的时候），时而缓和（例如当反右派斗争取得胜利，阶级敌人被迫退却的时候），我们必须继续保持警惕，注视这方面的发展变化。当阶级关系尖锐化起来的时候，我们必须强调这方面的斗争，并且坚决粉碎一切反社会主义、反劳动人民的分子的进攻，如同这次反右派斗争所做的那样。但是，鉴于资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子的大多数（中间派）是能够接受社会主义改造和无产阶级领导的，我们仍然应该信任他们中间的多数，帮助他们进行彻底的改造，使他们在政治上思想上同右派划清界限，克服在资本主义立场和社会主义立场中间动摇不定的两面性，过好社会主义这一关，并且争取他们中的许多人逐步从中间派转入左派，扩大左派的队伍。当然，这是一个长时期的反复的过程，中间还会起变化。他们中间的大多数会逐渐进步，逐步改造好，也会有一部分改造不好，但是数量不会很多。
    我们说两个阶级、两条道路之间的矛盾，包括敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾两类，这并不是说，目前我国人民内部的矛盾都属于两个阶级、两条道路之间的矛盾，而劳动人民内部就没有矛盾了。党中央和毛泽东同志指示我们：人民内部的矛盾除了存在于一般的资产阶级分子同劳动人民之间的以外，还更广泛地存在于劳动人民内部和工人阶级内部。毛泽东同志的报告“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，以及人民日报编辑部的文章“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”和“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”，对于这个问题都曾有全面的深刻的分析。毛泽东同志指出：“在社会主义社会中，基本的矛盾仍然是生产关系和生产力之间的矛盾，上层建筑和经济基础之间的矛盾。……我国的社会主义制度还刚刚建立，还没有完全建成，还不完全巩固。在工商业的公私合营企业中，资本家还拿取定息，也就是还有剥削；就所有制这点上说，这类企业还不是完全的社会主义性质的。农业生产合作社和手工业生产合作社有一部分也还是半社会主义性质的；完全社会主义化的合作社在所有制的某些个别问题上，还需要继续解决。在各经济部门中的生产和交换的相互关系，还在按照社会主义的原则逐步建立，逐步找寻比较适当的形式。在全民所有制经济和集体所有制经济里面，在这两种社会主义经济形式之间，积累和消费的分配问题是一个复杂的问题，也不容易一下子解决得完全合理。总之，社会主义生产关系已经建立起来，它是和生产力的发展相适应的；但是，它又还很不完善，这些不完善的方面和生产力的发展又是相矛盾的。除了生产关系和生产力发展的这种又相适应又相矛盾的情况以外，还有上层建筑和经济基础的又相适应又相矛盾的情况。人民民主专政的国家制度和法律，以马克思列宁主义为指导的社会主义意识形态，这些上层建筑对于我国社会主义改造的胜利和社会主义劳动组织的建立起了积极的推动作用，它是和社会主义的经济基础即社会主义的生产关系相适应的；但是，资产阶级意识形态的存在，国家机构中某些官僚主义作风的存在，国家制度中某些环节上缺陷的存在，又是和社会主义的经济基础相矛盾的。我们今后必须按照具体的情况，继续解决上述的各种矛盾。”毛泽东同志在这里所指出的种种矛盾，一部分属于资产阶级同无产阶级的矛盾，一部分属于小资产阶级同无产阶级的矛盾，一部分是由于资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想作风传染到无产阶级中的许多人，因而在无产阶级内部产生的矛盾，但是还有许多矛盾却不是由于阶级的存在或者阶级影响的存在，而是由于人们的主观认识不符合于客观实际，人们的领导工作落后于群众需要。这是一种主观同客观、先进同落后的矛盾，这类矛盾就是在阶级和阶级影响完全消灭以后也仍然会继续产生。在同过渡时期比较起来称得起完全巩固了的社会主义社会中，以及在往后亿万斯年的共产主义社会中，生产关系的发展到了一定时期仍然会落后于生产力的发展，上层建筑的发展到了一定时期也仍然会落后于经济基础的发展。因此，仍然需要及时地发现经济制度和政治制度中的日常性质和特殊性质的矛盾，及时地加以调整。有了正确的制度，还需要正确地运用这种制度，还需要有正确的政策、正确的工作方法和工作作风。在所有这些方面，领导工作情况怎样，是好还是坏，是采取辩证唯物主义的思想方法还是采取主观的片面的思想方法，是走在客观实际和群众觉悟的前面还是落在后面，具有很大的作用。总之，在阶级矛盾消灭以后，正确和错误、革新和守旧、先进和落后、积极和消极这类矛盾，仍将不断地在各种不同的条件下和各种不同的情况中出现。而人类社会也就将在不断地克服这类矛盾的过程中不断前进。矛盾永远是推动人类社会前进的动力。
    由此可见，人民内部的矛盾需要加以分析。以我们党的整风为例。我们在整风中要着重反对的官僚主义、宗派主义作风，要着重批判的个人主义、自由主义、无政府主义、绝对平均主义和民族主义思想，这些是资产阶级、小资产阶级思想影响的反映。但是我们要反对的主观主义作风，却是认识上的问题。我们要解决许多先进和落后的矛盾，例如对于工业发展速度和农业发展速度的某些争论，对于形势发展快慢的不同估计的某些争论。这种争论将来永远也是会有的。对于这种矛盾，就不能看作阶级矛盾的反映，更不必说当作敌我矛盾来处理了。
    我们有些同志过去一个时期怀疑党及时地提出正确处理人民内部矛盾问题，怀疑党的若干基本政策的正确性，主要地就是由于没有具体地分析国内的阶级关系和主要矛盾，对不同性质的矛盾又缺乏具体分析。
    我们有一些同志喜欢用压服的方法处理人民内部矛盾，总觉得说服的方法收效慢，或者收效小。这是没有根据的。看来他们好像很“左”，其实，恰巧说明了他们很右。事实证明，对人民采取说服的方法，是马克思主义的最积极、最有效的方法。我们同志们相信马克思主义、相信共产主义事业的最后胜利，难道不是被说服的结果而是被压服的结果吗？为什么我们可以被先进的同志们说服了，而我们就不能用同样的方法说服别人呢？对人民采取压服的方法，这不是别的，正是历史上一切剥削阶级对待被剥削阶级的方法，正是国民党反动派的方法。国民党蒋介石是最会向帝国主义屈服、向人民施“威风”的。我们必须反掉这种国民党作风的影响，不许向人民施“威风”。我们一定要相信群众的大多数，一定要相信党能够说服大多数，团结一切可能团结的人，改造旧社会，创造新社会，并且在这个过程中，把旧社会的人改造成社会主义社会的人。在剥削制度下，旧社会把人训练成自私自利，而在新社会的条件下，随着政治上、思想上的斗争的逐步深入，随着社会主义经济基础的日益强大和巩固，就有可能最后肃清资产阶级思想的影响，使旧社会来的人改造成为具有无产阶级大公无私的思想的人。这当然是一个长期的过程。但是，我国的社会运动和社会发展的规律告诉我们，局势是有利于我们这样做的。
    整风运动的经验，最有力地说明对人民采取说服方法的伟大效力。经过今年的全民整风和反右派斗争，我们很多同志学会了用大鸣大放、大争大辩、贴大字报、开辩论会等等一套方法，正确地处理了我们工人阶级内部、劳动人民内部的大批问题，以及同资产阶级的阶级矛盾中的大批问题，取得很宝贵的经验。同时，我们还取得了用大鸣大放、大争大辩、摆事实、讲道理的一套方法，就是说，也用处理人民内部矛盾的方法，处理我们同资产阶级右派这一种敌我矛盾的经验。这是极为重要的收获。但是，我们还有不少同志没有学会或者没有完全学会这套办法，不少同志对实事求是的群众路线的工作方法还有抵触。因此，我们各级党组织和各级领导同志要下定决心，不但自己要对当前的阶级关系和国内的主要矛盾和大量存在的矛盾有一个清楚的了解，还要帮助各级党组织直到基层党组织、基层干部都能认清形势，分别各类矛盾，并且能够正确地加以处理。只要我们大家有了经验，并且把大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报、座谈会、辩论会、摆事实、讲道理、边整边改等等这一套办法完全学会，并且把它变成经常的制度，经常的方法，今后许多事情就好办了。无论是革命问题或者建设问题，无论是大是大非或者是小是小非问题，都可以运用这一套办法迅速地加以解决。
    其次，需要估计一下我们工作的成就。
    尽管资产阶级右派说我们这也搞糟了，那也搞糟了，但是，经过反右派斗争和全民大辩论，人们已经清楚地看到：我们的党领导全国人民实现了各族人民的大团结，进行了惊天动地的大革命，展开了突飞猛进的大建设，这是连社会主义的敌人也无法否认的，因为这是铁一般的事实。经过1956年达到高潮的三大改造运动，我国基本上完成了经济战线上（在生产资料所有制方面）的社会主义革命。这样一个中国历史上最深刻的革命，是用和平的方法实现的，在经济上和社会秩序上没有发生波动和破坏，这是一个很大的成功。今年的全民整风和反右派斗争，又取得了政治战线上和思想战线上的巨大胜利，这又是一个很大的成功。我国的第一个五年计划已经完成和超额完成。事实上，其中一些重要任务和重要指标早在1956年就已经完成和超额完成了。我国工业化的初步基础已经奠定。我国的农业在合作化以后的新条件下正在向前跃进。我国的科学文化事业日益繁荣。我国的面貌已经根本改变，我国的国际地位已经空前提高。由于党中央关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”“长期共存、互相监督”等等一系列政策的贯彻执行，全国一切可以调动的力量，正在调动起来为社会主义服务。我国人民的团结，在党的领导下日益加强和巩固。我国人民正以愚公移山、精卫填海的精神，改造旧社会，建设新中国，这都是任何人也否认不了的事实。
    就我们上海各个战线上的工作来说，也是一样。其中最重要的是，我们已经把占全国比重很大的上海资本主义工商业基本上改造成为社会主义经济，同时基本上完成了农业和手工业的社会主义改造，这就改变了上海的政治和经济面貌，为上海的建设开辟了广阔的道路。国家第一个五年计划所规定的上海经济和文化建设的各项指标也已经完成和超额完成。今年上海的工业总产值预计是一百二十八亿元，其中除去手工业产值三亿元外，工业产值是一百二十五亿元，占全国工业产值的20％左右，超过第一个五年计划指标的16.3％，比解放初期的1949年增加297.51％，比第一个五年计划开始前的1952年增加96％，平均每年增长14.5％。在工业总产值中，重工业、一般轻工业和纺织工业的比重，也分别从1949年的16.7％、22.6％、60％，变为1957年的41.2％、26.2％、32.6％。这是一个很重要的变化。随着全国经济建设的发展，随着上海经济的改造，上海工业制造了大批的新产品，机器制造工业也从过去只能进行装配变为可以独立制造，许多产品的质量达到了国际水平，这就使上海这个工业基地能够供应全国人民更多的生产资料和生活资料，能够为发展国内外贸易供应更多的物资，能够为国家积累更多的建设资金。这又是一个很重要的变化。郊区农业合作化的胜利，加上上海的有利条件，为争取郊区提前实现“全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）”所规定的任务准备了条件。文化教育战线和其他各个战线也有了很大的成绩。劳动就业逐步扩大的结果，已经基本上消除了历史上遗留下来的失业现象。更重要的是人的变化。几年来的各项政治运动和社会改革运动，不但锻炼了上海工人阶级，使上海工人的政治觉悟、组织程度和技术水平都有了提高，能够担负起领导阶级的重任，而且也推动了各界人民的政治思想改造。今年的反右派斗争，证明了光荣的上海工人，首先是老工人，是维护社会主义的最坚决的力量；证明了其他各界人民几年来有了很大的进步，他们中间已经形成了一个有力量的左派；中间分子也有程度不同的进步；右派只占极少数。没有广大人民社会主义觉悟的提高，在短短的时间内，使得右派分子遭到孤立和分化，遭到严重的失败，是不可能的。全民整风运动虽然还没有结束，但是它已经给我们带来了无可比拟的力量，促使上海各个战线上的工作都大大地前进了一步。谁也可以看到今天的上海，已经不是殖民地半殖民地的旧上海了。冒险家乐园的旧上海已经随着黑暗的时代一去不返了。新的人民的上海已经在社会主义革命的暴风雨中成长起来。明天的上海，将是我们祖国社会主义经济和文化建设的更加强大的基地，屹立在东海岸国防前线的更加强大的堡垒。
    我们上海的工作所以取得这些成绩，是上海百万工人英勇斗争和忘我劳动的结果，是上海七百万人民团结一致共同奋斗的结果，是全国人民全力支援的结果，是中央和毛泽东同志英明领导的结果，也是上海各级党组织和广大干部努力地、积极地贯彻执行党中央各项正确政策的结果。在回顾我们取得的这些伟大成就的时候，我们向全市的工人同志和各界人民表示热烈的祝贺，向全国人民表示深深的感谢。同时，我们上海的工人阶级和上海人民同全国的工人阶级和全国人民一样，大家都以有中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导而自豪。
    在这里，我们还要答复一个问题：上海各方面工作发展得这样快，是不是“冒进”了？
    有一部分同志曾经认为我们上海的各项工作都“冒进”了。在对上海工业方针的争论中，就突出地表现了这一点。大家记得，1956年，市的党代表大会第一次会议曾经确定了“充分利用、合理发展”上海工业的方针。这个方针，一方面反对了忽视上海这个工业基地的作用，不注意利用这个基地为国家的社会主义建设服务的思想；另一方面也反对了不顾全国的统筹安排和当地的具体条件，盲目大发展的思想。事实证明：这个方针，给上海的工作带来了朝气，推动了各个方面的工作蓬勃地开展起来。有的同志说，由于有了这个方针，上海各方面的工作“冒进”了。这种意见，是不符合实际情况的。就全局来说，倒是因为有了这个方针，才调动了各种积极因素，又限制了各方面的盲目发展。一年来上海工作的发展是正常的。问题是对于什么叫正常、什么叫冒进，有完全不同的了解。
    毛泽东同志在1955年12月27日为“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书写的序言中，对于我国的社会主义建设的基本形势曾经作过这样的分析：“现在提到全党和全国人民面前的问题，已经不是批判在农业的社会主义改造速度方面的右倾保守思想的问题，这个问题已经解决了。也不是在资本主义工商业按行业实行全面公私合营的速度方面的问题，这个问题也已经解决了。手工业的社会主义改造的速度问题，在1956年上半年应当谈一谈，这个问题也会容易解决的。现在的问题，不是在这些方面，而是在其他方面。这里有农业的生产，工业（包括国营、公私合营和合作社营）和手工业生产，工业和交通运输业的基本建设的规模和速度，商业同其他经济部门的配合，科学、文化、教育、卫生等项工作同各种经济事业的配合等等方面。在这些方面，都是存在着对于情况估计不足的缺点的，都应当加以批判和克服，使之适应整个情况的发展。人们的思想必须适应已经变化了的情况。当然，任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。但是现在的问题，还是右倾保守思想在许多方面作怪，使许多方面的工作不能适应客观情况的发展。现在的问题是经过努力本来可以做到的事情，却有很多人认为做不到。因此，不断地批判那些确实存在的右倾保守思想，就有完全的必要了。”毛泽东同志这段话，值得我们反复地阅读和思索。“现在的问题是经过努力本来可以做到的事情，却有很多人认为做不到”，我们有些同志的思想难道不是这样的吗？
    我们认为，既然是干社会主义革命、干社会主义建设，干这种前无古人的事业，干这种同帝国主义争时间、比速度的事业，那就必须有一股革命的干劲。那就必须对上海的各种有利于社会主义的因素采取积极的态度，并且争取把消极因素变为积极因素，根据国家的统筹安排，千方百计地出主意、想办法，充分地利用上海基地为社会主义服务。因此，在我们看来，凡是经过努力可以做到的事情，就努力做到，这才是正常现象；不去努力做到，这才是不正常现象。否则，就谈不到革命态度、革命气概和革命速度，就谈不到尽可能快地把我国建设成一个社会主义强国。因此，我们应该坚决贯彻执行多、快、好、省的勤俭建国方针。这是一个统一的不可分的方针。为了多、快、好，就需要勤，就需要努力，就需要认真；为了省，就需要俭，也需要努力，需要认真。这个方针，是既反对了右倾保守，又反对了急躁冒进。这是一个促进的而不是“促退”的方针，是在现在的国际环境中，我国社会主义建设所应该采取的唯一正确方针，而且是一个已经在实践中证明行之有效的正确方针。在执行这个方针的过程中，也可能发生个别缺点和错误，但是决不能因此对整个方针发生动摇。曾经有些人同党的看法相反，他们把这种革命态度、革命气概和革命速度，看作是冒进，看作是“好大喜功”。他们总是说这也办多了，那也办快了，这也冒进了，那也冒进了。他们就是不看一看到底是社会主义前进了，还是资本主义前进了；到底是社会主义多了、快了，还是资本主义多了、快了；到底是“好”社会主义之“大”、“喜”社会主义之“功”，还是相反。试问，经过一番努力能够使社会主义前进得快一些、多一些，这难道是错误吗？难道我们能够说，经过一番努力就能够做到的也不去做，以便社会主义事业前进得慢一些、少一些，才是正确的、才是正常的吗？难道我们坚决执行多、快、好、省的方针，就叫做“好大喜功”，就要受到责备，而执行相反的方针才应当受到赞扬吗？当然，赞扬的人是有的，但决不会来自渴望早日建成社会主义社会的广大人民。因此，我们必须批判这种实际存在的右倾保守思想。这种思想已经给我们造成了一些损失。去年下半年以后，多、快、好、省的方针不大提了，贯彻“全国农业发展纲要”的规划也执行得不带劲了，不少人的革命干劲低落了。这才叫作不正常现象。在整风运动中，必须批判这种右倾保守观点，改正各种不正常现象，以便迎接新的建设高潮，促进建设事业的新高涨。
    二
    我们的工作是得到了伟大成就的，这是主要方面，这是完全肯定的，不应当有任何怀疑。如有怀疑，应予解释。但是在我们的工作中也有很多的缺点和错误。现在要谈一谈这些缺点和错误。
    今年4月份以来，在各次大鸣大放中党内外提出了几百万条批评和意见（其中有许多是重复的）。这些批评和意见，有批评各级党组织和干部的，其中也有不少是批评我们市委和市委领导同志的。对各级党组织和党员干部的批评，实际上也是对我们市委的批评。这些批评，除去属于资产阶级右派进攻性质的以外，绝大多数是善意的、正确的或者基本正确的。虽然有些不完全正确，甚至大部分不正确，却只是由于认识问题，不是由于恶意。这些批评，对于帮助我们了解了许多我们平时不了解的事情，使我们了解提意见者的心理状态，使我们更清楚地看到了我们工作的全貌，仍然有好处。对于所有为了帮助党整风而提善意批评的党内外的同志们和朋友们，市委特向他们表示诚恳的感谢。
    群众的批评，千条万条，总起来说就是要我们改掉我们在工作上、组织上、作风上的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的坏现象。大家知道：官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，都是脱离群众、脱离实际的，都是妨害我们同志进步，妨害我们的团结，妨害我们的事业前进的，都是同我们党和人民的根本利益不相容的。我们的党，一不怕帝国主义，二不怕国内反动势力，三不怕向自然界作战中的艰难困苦，就是怕脱离群众。脱离群众也必然脱离实际。党和人民紧密地团结在一起，就没有不可战胜的敌人，就没有不可攻破的堡垒。而如果我们不去掉官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义等等缺点错误，我们就不可能团结一切可能团结的力量，我们就不能顺利前进。不但如此，如果缺点错误不去掉，还会继续发展，甚至致人死命。马克思列宁主义的、无产阶级的思想作风是在同非马克思主义的、非无产阶级的思想作风作斗争中发展起来的。我们的党现在是一个政治上成熟的伟大的马克思列宁主义的政党，任何歪风也压不倒它。但这并不是说，也不可能压倒我们个别的党员干部和个别的党组织。整风运动正是为了帮助我们全党所有真正愿意为共产主义事业奋斗到底的同志，用马克思列宁主义的、无产阶级的思想武装起来，战胜非无产阶级的、非马克思列宁主义的思想作风，成为坚强的共产主义战士。同现在的缺点错误作斗争，我们同志学到教训，就可以取得免疫力，就可以使我们的思想水平和工作水平大大提高。1942年的整风运动为我国1949年的胜利准备了条件。1957年到1958年的整风，就是为我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的彻底的全面的胜利准备条件。因此，我们必须大胆地放，坚决地放，彻底地放；大胆地改，坚决地改，彻底地改。
    群众在整风中所提出的意见，可以分为三类：一是工作上的问题，二是组织上的问题，三是作风上的问题。
    群众对工作上的意见，重要的有以下几个方面：
    （1）批评我们有些同志自从1956年下半年以来干劲不够旺盛。有些重大工作，开始时雷声很大，后来雨点很小，有的甚至“有始无终”。他们说，多快好省的方针提出来的时候，起劲地宣传了一阵，后来就没有下文了；增产节约运动和农业发展纲要四十条的执行，开始时搞得轰轰烈烈，后来也松了劲，不知被哪里吹来的冷风吹掉了。
    （2）对于一些干部强调业务第一，认为“业务就是政治”、不看报、不读书、不关心国家大事、只管业务不问政治的非政治倾向，以及另一方面，有一些党群系统的政治工作干部空谈政治、不钻研业务、甚至拒绝学习、不求进步的倾向，群众都表示不满。近几年来，由于一部分干部不认真钻研业务，影响到某些工业产品质量下降，或者是停滞不前，为其他省区所超过，工人群众和消费者对这种情况都有意见。至于个别同志对业务、政治两不关心，更受到群众的指责。
    （3）对执行勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的方针不够认真，对严重的浪费现象无动于衷的状况也引起群众的不满。我们不少单位的铺张浪费现象确实是惊人的。复旦大学生物系养了一批狗供学生实验用，特地盖了一座“狗宫”，设备十分讲究，可与西郊公园的象房比美。梅林罐头食品厂职工揭露，该厂1954年以来浪费的资财达四十五万元，约占该厂现有流动资金的一半。
    （4）在政法战线上，过去贯彻执行中央的肃反政策是有很大成绩的，但也有若干案件处理不妥，有粗糙简单的缺点。可是政法部门少数领导人员，在纠正这种缺点错误的时候，又犯了宽大无边的错误。旧法观点在某些政法工作人员中，还很严重地存在。
    （5）在文教工作中，对提高教学质量的要求重视不够；培养工人阶级知识分子队伍，缺乏明确的目标和具体的措施，长期放松对青年的政治思想工作。
    （6）在对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造方面，合营以后有所放松，没有特别重视企业改造必须同对人的改造相结合。
    此外，在有关各部门的具体工作中，如生产管理工作、干部工作等，还提出了许多意见。这些都需要在整改中加以解决。
    二是组织上的问题。组织方面的缺点主要表现在下列几个方面：
    （1）机构臃肿。为了适应社会主义建设的需要，近几年来，增设了一些机关，扩大了一些机构，补充了一些工作人员，这是必要的。但是，由于一部分领导干部不从实际需要出发，造成了机关、企业机构臃肿、层次重叠，非生产人员过多的严重现象。仅以筑港工程来说，本市就有四个筑港工程单位，形成“四马分肥”的局面，而工程有限，浪费了许多人力。蓬莱区只有五家水果店共十一个职工，也建立了一个区店，配备了三个干部，大家都无事可做。机构臃肿、层次重叠的现象，也助长了领导干部脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义作风。许多领导干部浮在上面，成天沉没于报表、会议、文件之中，很少有时间深入下层了解下情，帮助基层解决问题。因此，人们批评这种现象为“头重脚轻根底浅”。
    （2）统一集中和分工负责的关系不够协调。党、政、群众团体之间，既存在着应该由党统一领导而没有统一起来的现象，也存在着应该由有关方面分头去办而没有人办的现象；部门与部门之间，既存在着应该协同配合却互不相谋的现象，也存在着应该独立负责却互相推诿的现象。在上下级之间，既存在着部分权力应该下放却干涉过多的现象，也存在着应该统一指挥却多头多脑的现象。
    （3）对基层工作的领导还很薄弱。有时候管得太多太死，没有充分发挥基层组织应起的作用。特别是对基层干部政治上帮助太少，表现在交代任务多，进行革命形势的教育少，使得许多干部成天忙忙碌碌，但摸不清当前政治方向；并且在交代任务之后，进行政策教育也不够，也使得许多干部很难摸准政策的精神实质，在执行时发生了困难，又未能及时予以具体的支持。此外，整顿基层党组织、纯洁队伍的工作，平时也注意不够。
    （4）在干部配备方面，有一部分干部用非所长或者能力与职务不太相称，没有及时加以调整；有许多薄弱环节，特别是文教系统，急需补充骨干，长期没有加强。
    第三个问题是作风上的问题，尤其是党员领导干部的作风问题。群众在大鸣大放中，对于这方面的意见是最集中、最突出的。据党群、政法、财贸、工业、市政交通各系统开展整风的单位和市人民委员会机关、区级机关大鸣大放中所提出的二百零二万六千七百九十五条意见中，属于领导作风方面的意见，占总数的50％以上。二百一十七个大工厂，三十一万职工所提出的意见，领导作风方面也占35％。领导作风问题，主要是一部分党员领导干部同群众的关系问题。群众对领导作风的意见，实际上反映了他们对一部分党员领导干部在不同程度上脱离群众的“官气”的不满。这次整改，首先就要狠狠地整掉这种“官气”。少数党员领导干部脱离群众的情况，大致表现在以下一些方面：
    生活上的特殊化：住房子、用家具要多要好；工资级别、奖金、补助费评的较高，领的较多；个别干部几年没有工作还要提级，生活并无困难，还经常领补助费。不遵守人事制度，自开方便之门，随意介绍私人。不遵守规章组织制度，不遵守劳动纪律。有的领导干部不参加支部生活，有的厂长、党委书记和党员干部不参加工会。这类特殊化现象，虽然不是普遍的，特别严重的也不多，但影响很坏。
    不接近群众，对群众态度不好：许多人批评我们党的领导同志，包括市委的领导同志，同群众见面少，到车间、到工地、到田间、到连队、到课堂、到基层少，甚至说只能在报上看到我们。有些单位的群众，连本单位的领导同志也不大容易见到。有些领导干部见了群众也不亲热，“两只手插在裤袋里，笑也不笑一下”；有些领导同志缺乏应有的谦虚，对群众傲慢，盛气凌人，官气十足。群众还批评我们领导干部的工作，只会开会，办公文，有的就只有开会这一条，有时候弄得上上下下一天到晚开会。不但领导干部不能深入群众，许多基层干部、积极分子经常被拉来开会，也很少时间在群众中间活动。许多积极分子，一入党反而同群众疏远了。党员只同党员在一起，群众的呼声不大容易及时地传到党内来，而领导同志并没有把这当作一个大问题，帮助党员改善同群众的联系。
    在工作中民主作风不够：有的同志遇事很少认真同群众商量，或者不同群众商量，只是爱好行政命令。决定问题的时候，从领导的主观意图考虑多，认真分析群众意见少，没有把两方面统一起来。自上而下的布置工作多，自下而上的听取群众的意见少。群众有时候对领导布置的工作有意见，合理的意见不采纳，办不到的不解释或者不及时解释，不合理的不说服，错误的不教育。有些领导干部同群众谈话，也总是指示、命令的口气多，叫人望而生畏，久而久之，群众有了意见也不愿意提了。他们说，提了没有用，还提它干什么？在这种情况下，群众的积极性得不到发挥，领导工作很吃力，又得不到好的效果。
    办事马虎拖拉：有许多问题，早就应该解决也可以解决，但是平时不办，直到这次鸣放中受到群众批评才办。特别是有关群众真正存在的疾苦问题解决不及时，平时热忱地关心群众各方面的需要也不够。第二毛纺厂帆布车间一块地板坏了一尺左右，妨碍生产，工人提了几年的意见，领导一直置之不理，直到这次鸣放才得到解决。1956年8月20日，有一个机关向机关事务管理局请求拨给一辆汽车，公文到了局的办公室，主任批给总务处，处长批给交通科，交通科签具意见到了处，处长报局长，局长批送秘书长，秘书长说要请示副市长，于是又原封不动从局长——办公室主任——总务处长——交通科长，要交通科长写报告，然后又回到局长。局长批：“已用电话请示副市长，指示按制度办理。”于是又将公文送副秘书长，批了“同意”、送秘书长阅，再按上述办公室——总务处——交通科次序，最后归档，时已10月22日。来回批了十三次，用时两个月，始终没有走出市人民委员会大楼。
    为什么在我们党内会出现这样一些缺点错误呢？
    在一方面，这是由于旧社会的习惯势力、资产阶级的、国民党的思想作风对于我们队伍的侵袭。在上海的二十六万七千名干部（不包括中小学和公私合营企业的干部）中，有80％左右是解放后参加工作的。在三万七千名科长级以上的干部中，也有56％以上是解放后参加工作的。他们是我们干部队伍中的新血液，对工作是作了很多贡献的。但是他们多数出身于非无产阶级，没有经过生产劳动和严重的阶级斗争的锻炼，还保持着不少非无产阶级思想作风。老干部中也有一些人，或多或少地滋长了骄傲自满情绪，沾染了旧社会的坏思想、坏作风。
    在另一方面，这也是由于我们还缺乏经验。我们正在进行的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，在中国历史上是破天荒的事业。虽然党中央和毛泽东同志是善于将马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命具体实践相结合的，但是，就我们广大干部说来，毕竟是没有经验或者经验不足的。因此，在贯彻执行党中央制定的各种正确政策时，仍然难以避免发生这种或那种偏差，也难以完全及时地认识和纠正这些偏差。
    如上所说，许多缺点和错误的存在，反映了市委领导上的缺点。从总的方面来说，市委是贯彻执行了中央的方针政策的，缺点在于根据中央的方针政策结合上海干部的思想实际反复地进行教育不够；在部署重大工作任务时，有前紧后松、时紧时松的毛病；在工作过程中，深入地检查执行的情况，重点地总结成功和失败的经验，借以提高干部，带动全面工作，做得不够经常。我们愿意下决心同大家一起来克服这些缺点。
    三
    改正缺点错误的关键首先在于有没有决心，其次还在于下了决心之后，有没有一套正确的整改办法。
    可以肯定地说，群众提的意见虽然很多，但是归纳起来，绝大部分是完全应该而且能够由我们本市各级党组织自己来改正的。水产学院对群众提的三千四百零四条意见，作了系统分析，其中基本上对和部分对部分不对的这两项，占总数的91％以上。这些意见中属于自己能够立即改正的占64％以上，属于意见正确但需要创造条件才能改正的占20％弱，两者合计，即占总数的84％以上；真正需要上级帮助解决的很少很少，只占6％强；另有9％的意见是属于做不到的。其他单位的情况也大体类似。这是因为大多数问题都是由于自己工作上、作风上的毛病产生的，“解铃还是系铃人”，只要自己下决心把绳子一解，铃就拿下来了。
    卢湾区委、交通局、房地局、第一机床公司等四个单位的经验就是最有力的证明。据这四个单位的统计，鸣放中共提出一万九千条意见，已经解决的占73.4％，正在改的占13.7％，两者合计占87％以上。可见只要下定决心，90％左右的问题并不难解决。
    比如说，群众对特殊化最不满意，改起来有没有困难呢？房子住多了，家具用多了，让出来就是了；房租低了，适当增加就是了；私事用了公家汽车，以后不用就是了；补助费领多了，退回去，以后不再多领；有关生活福利的问题，为了防止处理不公平、不适当，以后加强领导、好好走群众路线也就好办了；个别党员的级别确属过高，自动地适当降低也就解决了（但是不要形成普遍调整级别）。这样做，难道不是很容易的吗？
    又如，群众批评领导人员不接近群众，改起来有没有困难呢？比起上边说的一些问题，好像复杂一些，但是，只要我们大家下决心，改进工作方法，认真地精简会议，直接到工农兵群众和知识分子群众中去，调查研究，解决问题，就不算困难了。而且一旦大家下去了，同群众在一起，有了味道，冗长的会议就会减少，必要召开的会议，也能更有准备，更能解决问题了。旧习惯是可以打破的，新习惯、新风气是可以养成的。见了群众“铁板着面孔”，这难道还不容易改吗？两只手插在裤袋里，惹人讨厌，拿出来就是了，这又有什么困难呢？
    工作中的许多问题，方针政策执行中的许多问题，组织机构问题，可能更加复杂些。但是只要我们认真研究中央的指示，遇事多同群众商量，多动脑筋、多动手，亲自下去检查总结工作，把同类性质的好坏典型认真的作一番对比研究，取得解决问题的直接经验，不要把什么事都交给秘书代劳，不要只靠第三手、第四手不可靠的材料过日子，问题就解决了一大半。
    有的同志说：这样讲，把整改说得太容易了。其实，并不是说整改容易，而是说只要下了决心，就容易了。常言说：“世上无难事，只怕有心人。”世界上的事情，只怕不认真，认起真来，就没有克服不了的困难。两只手插在裤袋里，拿出来好像容易，但这里实际上是一个群众关系问题。采取不认真的态度，只是把手从裤袋里拿出来，当然并没有解决根本问题。但是，如果采取认真的态度，不单是把手拿出来，而是从这里开始，认真地去加强同群众的联系，问题就可以从根本上解决了。至于有些或者由于一时没有经验，或者由于一时没有条件，不能马上解决的，只要采取认真的态度，也就能够早一些取得经验，早一些创造出条件。总之，最大多数的问题是可以、也必须由我们自己解决，需要中央解决的为数很少。这里说的我们，就是指各级领导干部，包括市委领导同志在内。只要我们下定决心，就一定能够大胆地改，坚决地改，彻底地改。
    有些同志下不了决心，一是因为把整改神秘化，他们还没把问题排排队，分析分析，只感觉到问题一大堆，不知从何下手；二是因为畏难，怕痛，怕群众，怕引火烧身；三是因为缺乏共产党员应有的任劳任怨精神，对群众的批评不服气，以为自己做的是对的，只是方式不好，就给我贴了这么多大字报，实在冤枉得很。因此，有些人想用形式主义的办法进行整改，以便混过整改这一关。但是这是注定要失败的。过去的缺点错误还没有改，旧债未还又欠下新债。这种债是高利贷，“驴打滚”，利上加利，愈滚愈大。我们劝这些同志不要欠这种债。只要把群众提的意见认真地分析一下，就有了“底”，就有了信心。只要对党、对群众、对自己都采取老老实实的认真的态度，不迷信自己，相信群众的多数，就比较容易下决心。有了这种决心，解决一批问题，我们同志就会尝到整改的甜头了，就会感觉到心情舒畅，认识到这一课非上不可，整改非做彻底不可了。
    当然，矛盾是永远存在的。旧矛盾解决了，又会产生新矛盾，问题总是需要不断解决的。但是这次彻底进行整改，取得了经验，下次再来解决新问题，办法就多了，信心就大了，决心也就容易下了。
    有了决心，还要有正确的方法，根据先行单位的经验，正确的方法仍然是实事求是，群众路线。
    各个单位的领导同志，应该把鸣放以来群众的意见，加以整理分析，定出一个大致的规划，明确整改的步骤。由于各个单位鸣放中的问题不同，整改的规划步骤也不可能千篇一律。根据多数单位的情况，由于领导作风问题比较突出，先从整顿领导作风开始，从改变特殊化、脱离群众的宗派主义现象开始，比较适当。一方面，群众对这方面的意见最多，总要占意见总数的35％——50％左右，首先改，就有力地体现了领导同志整顿自己的决心，鼓舞起群众帮助领导整风的积极性；另方面，这一类问题并不太复杂，只要有决心，容易改，收效快；同时领导作风问题，又是带根本性质的关键性问题，这个问题改得好，群众的工作、学习、生活方面的许多问题就跟着解决了。已有的经验证明，只要解决了一批这类问题，领导和被领导、党员和非党员、党组织和群众的关系就大大改善，整个单位的政治空气就变得生动活泼起来，造成了进一步整改的良好条件。
    在处理了一大批领导作风问题以后，就可以根据工作上、组织上存在的问题，根据各单位不同情况，逐步进入各种专题整改。如结合干部下放，加强基层和薄弱环节，可以先解决组织方面的问题，结合整改工作的进行，就可以适当建立和健全民主制度，扩大民主生活；体制分工问题，自己能解决的先解决，牵涉到全市和中央有关部门的放在后面解决。这种专题鸣放，以逐题搞透为宜，也可以适当交叉。
    对于群众提出的对浪费的批评，必须认真对待。各个机关、企业、学校、团体，在整改过程中，应当抽出七天到十天时间，对浪费现象进行一次专题鸣放和整改，使勤俭建国的方针，能够真正深入贯彻执行起来。
    有了决心，有了规划，还必须坚决依靠群众，不是关在房子里改，而是在群众参加和监督下改。有的单位只由少数领导干部讨论，每天关门开会，急得头昏脑胀，晚上也不能睡觉，问题还是没有解决几条。当他们改变这种脱离群众的作法，同群众一起商量，大家一齐动脑筋，很快就解决了。所以要坚决走群众路线，不能用官僚主义反官僚主义。为了在整改中贯彻执行群众路线，每个单位的领导人应当向群众作报告，宣布整改的要求和大体规划，对领导上所存在的缺点错误进行自我批评，交代前两阶段边整边改的情况，号召群众积极鸣放，参加和监督整改。整改报告应在党委会上进行认真的讨论。党委委员和书记之间、党委委员之间的不同的意见应该揭开争论，否则报告软弱无力，不能鼓舞起整改的热情。
    对于那些可以立即改的问题，应分层分批立即动手进行，并且随时把整改的情况，向群众公布，做到多数群众满意为止。凡是受批评的党员干部，都应当向群众作出公开的交代。
    各种整改方案，不但应当在群众鸣放的基础上拟定，而且要在群众反复讨论中和监督下执行。每一个问题的整改，都要充分运用大字报、座谈会、辩论会的形式，而且可以组织各种检查小组、方案小组，吸引群众参加，领导和群众相结合，可以使方案比较切合实际，如有错误，也比较容易改。
    整改阶段也是领导和群众进行自我教育和互相教育的过程。在整改鸣放中，什么叫正确，什么叫错误，怎么办有利于社会主义，怎么办不利于社会主义，这对领导和群众都是锻炼。有一个单位，在讨论取消特殊化问题的时候，有些人提出了领导干部住的房子应当根据平均主义原则一律紧缩的口号，经过群众实地调查和实事求是的讨论，既纠正了个别人确实住房过多的特殊化现象，又纠正了一部分人的平均主义思想，这比起由领导人出面批评平均主义思想收效大多了。所以，各级党委都要坚持群众路线，学会走群众路线。事实证明，凡是充分贯彻执行群众路线的单位，整改都进行得又快又好。
    现在，真正抗拒整改的人毕竟是个别的。对于那些整改决心不大、怕引火烧身的同志，要督促他们上阵，推到火热的斗争舞台上去。对于那些盛气凌人、官气十足的人，必须坚决督促他们改正。对于那些不善于走群众路线的人，要帮助他们进行实事求是的分析。特别是对少数不愿揭开自己缺点错误的党员，要坚决帮他揭开，这才是真正帮助同志，爱护同志，推动同志前进。我们一定要懂得：帮助一个同志，一定要帮彻底，不要为他袒护错误。在他不觉悟的时候，你袒护他，他会感谢你；但是等他因此而吃了大亏，或者觉悟提高了的时候，他就会怪你为什么在当时不帮他一把。你现在帮他揭开问题，在他不觉悟的时候，他会怪你，以为你同他为难；但是等他因此而提高了觉悟，他会感谢你的。我们决不能把同志关系庸俗化。
    在整改阶段，各个单位都要下放一批干部，目的一是为了使干部经受劳动锻炼逐步与工农结合，二是充实基层和加强薄弱环节，三是紧缩机构，使人力充分发挥作用。这三个目的是统一的，不可分的，都有重大革命意义。而最重要的，是使我们的干部经过参加体力劳动锻炼，具有完全的劳动观点和群众观点，造成一支对劳动人民无限忠诚的能够经受风险的干部队伍。
    以上是说的着重整改阶段的问题。
    全市的整风运动，根据先行单位的经验，只要不走弯路，时间并不要拖得很长。因此，市委认为，在已经全部或部分地开展整风运动的单位，应该根据中央关于整风运动的既定方针、政策，继续深入展开运动，有始有终地完成整风任务。在尚未展开运动的单位，应该积极做好开展运动的各项准备工作。各个单位（除医疗机构外）应该根据运动开展的先后，分别在1958年1、2、3、4、5月，最迟在6月左右，陆续地全部完成整风任务。
    市区两级机关的整风运动，应该抓紧进行，要求大部分在2月底完成整风任务，争取在3月底全部完成，以便腾出手来领导工厂、商店和里弄的整风运动，并且从已经进行整风的市区机关、大工厂中抽调干部组成工作组帮助他们进行。我们一定要重视基层单位的整风运动，决不要像过去各次政治运动那样，往往把一些小的单位遗漏掉，致使它们受不到社会主义教育。
    大专学校、科学研究机关和中等专业学校完成整风任务的时间，至迟不应超过5月底，中小学的整风运动，应该在寒暑假期间集中进行，必要时可适当延长寒假假期。民办学校和补习学校的社会主义思想教育，也应该从1958年上半年起进行。
    文艺界、新闻界、出版界、民主党派、工商界的整风和工业工人、商业职工以及汉族宗教界、少数民族中的社会主义教育运动，要求在1958年6月底完成。市政交通企业、事业单位的职工的社会主义教育运动，要求在1958年5月底完成。农民中的社会主义教育，应力求在1958年3月底以前完成，以便及时转入春耕生产。
    在这次会议以后，各区委应该根据上述部署，全面安排各区工业、商业、医疗卫生机构和中小学的整风运动。在机关整风告一段落后，就应分出一部分力量，从1958年3月份开始，进行里弄居民的社会主义教育工作，争取里弄居民的社会主义教育运动在6月左右基本完成。
    人民解放军驻沪部队的整风，按既定计划进行。
    全市的反右派斗争虽已取得决定性胜利，但是并没有完全结束。我们必须继续把反右派斗争进行到底，争取彻底的胜利。凡是已经开展反右派斗争、尚未取得全胜的单位，应该结合全民整风运动的第三阶段和第四阶段的工作，继续深入反右派斗争。已冒头的右派分子必须全部揭露出来，已揭露但未低头认罪的右派分子必须驳倒驳透、彻底孤立。反右派斗争是关系到国家生死存亡的一件大事，我们的同志切不能被胜利冲昏头脑，松弛斗志，草草了事。在防止草率收兵、前紧后松倾向的同时，还必须防止另外一种因急于结束斗争而放弃摆事实、讲道理的方针，形成斗争方式简单化的倾向。凡是已经开始鸣放、尚未发现右派的单位，必须保持冷静，切忌麻痹大意。一方面应该认识到经过今年春季的大暴露后，即使留下一些右派分子，但也为数不多了。某些单位经过实事求是的全面分析后，如果确实没有发现右派分子，那就不要去进行反右派斗争。另一方面，要认识到目前留下的右派分子虽然为数不多，而且也不可能再像1957年春季那样大量冒出来，但是，右派分子不多，总不等于没有。何况，阶级斗争的形势是时起时伏、曲折发展的，右派分子现在不冒头，总不等于将来永远也不会向党进攻。所以，不能漫不经心，滋长太平观念。此外，右派分子的处理问题，也必须在最近时期经过群众讨论，加以妥善解决。
    对整风中提出的需要全市统一安排的问题，如体制问题，精简机构、下放干部问题，加强基层领导问题，工资福利问题，贯彻执行“全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）”问题，人口问题，以及其他一些重要问题，市委根据各方面的意见，准备了几个报告和发言，请代表大会审议，不在这里重复。
    四
    整风运动胜利的标志，不仅是右派被孤立分化了，我们工作中的缺点克服了，而且我们党的干部必须是愈整革命意志愈旺盛，愈整阶级觉悟愈高，使我们的工作愈做愈朝气蓬勃，愈做愈好。
    我们共产党人应该是阶级觉悟最高、革命意志最旺盛的人。当资本主义看来还很强大的时候，马克思和恩格斯却看到了资产阶级的灭亡和无产阶级的胜利不可避免，看到了在社会主义革命中，无产阶级只会失去自己颈上的一条锁链，获得的却是整个世界。他们赤手空拳，百折不挠地为革命奋斗了一生。当列宁和他的同志们开始下决心在俄国实现无产阶级革命、建立社会主义社会的时候，他们只是人数不多的共产主义小组，但是到了1917年，他们终于领导了伟大的十月革命，创造了世界上第一个社会主义国家。当中国处在最黑暗的反动统治下的时候，中国共产主义者却在上海宣告中国共产党的成立，宣告共产主义必然在中国胜利。当蒋介石疯狂地屠杀革命人民，以为他的江山已经坐定了的时候，我们中国共产党却在井冈山升起了胜利的红旗。当时有多少人嘲笑马克思和恩格斯，嘲笑列宁，嘲笑中国共产党人，说他们是“白日作梦”。历史的发展却证明了，被嘲笑的不是共产党人，而是那些以为资本主义会万世长存的人们。我们共产党人讲究实事求是。实事求是的结果，证明了共产主义的胜利是历史发展的规律，谁也阻止不了世界向着共产主义过渡。因此，我们的革命意志不是来自空想，而是建立在科学共产主义理论的可靠的基础上的。正因为把个人的命运同伟大共产主义事业联系在一起，我们共产党人就鄙视资产阶级个人主义。我们的党员不是普通的人，而是觉悟的无产阶级的先进战士，他应该成为自觉的阶级利益、阶级意识的代表者之一，因此他的个人利益完全不应该在党和阶级的利益之外突出出来。正因为如此，我们共产党人永远是乐观主义者，我们的革命意志永远是旺盛的，是任何力量所不能摧毁的。在阶级斗争中，在战争中，在需要牺牲自己的时候，我们视死如归；在同自然界作斗争中，在进行建设的时候，我们要请高山低头，河水让路。这才是我们共产党人旺盛的革命意志的表现。
    就整个说来，我们上海党组织的革命意志是旺盛的，是有战斗力的。但是，从整风运动中暴露出来的情况看，不能说我们所有的干部革命意志都旺盛。根据粗略的分析，干部情况有以下三种：
    第一种人，革命意志旺盛。他们在工作中积极努力，艰苦奋斗，努力学习，有上进心。他们在复杂的环境中，能够密切联系群众，开动脑筋，调查研究，钻研问题，苦思多想，不怕困难，任劳任怨，富于主动性和创造性。在这样的干部作领导人的地方，那里的工作一定会是朝气勃勃地比较迅速地向前发展的，虽然也有缺点错误，但比较容易克服。在那里，干部和积极分子的成长也比较快。
    第二种人，能够工作，也不愿作坏事，但是缺乏发愤图强、顽强进取的精神。他们的特点是一般地能够完成党给他们的任务，可是墨守成规，很少有所创造。在工作中对政治不够关心，因而缺乏一种强大的政治动力。这些同志往往对于“经过努力本来可以做到的事情”，不愿意或不会去千方百计想办法，认真努力去做，一遇困难，就“认为做不到”，也就不去做了。他们中间有知识分子，自以为有知识，就不积极努力去同工农群众相结合。他们中间也有工农出身的同志，自己文化水平低，却又不积极努力学习。他们中间也有老干部，有一定的斗争经验，有一定的工作能力，但是因而自高自大，认为自己差不多了，也就不再积极努力提高自己的本领。他们中间有些同志有时也自觉到自己的落后，时有苦闷，又没有决心鼓起劲来干。因此，在他们担任领导工作的地方，工作改进迟缓，他们自己的进步也慢。
    第三种人，个人主义包袱较重，思想上开始发霉。他们还是想作革命工作的，但是他们或者以为自己是老资格，或者以为自己有功劳，或者虽然不是老资格，却自以为特别有本领，常常把个人同群众、个人同党的位置摆不对头。他们对群众，自以为高人一等，官气冲天。他们考虑问题往往是把个人利益放在前面，把党和人民的利益放在后面。有的人只要有机会，就争名于朝，争利于市，争到一些就高兴，争不到就闹情绪。这些人对待工作，沾染了“官气”，照例办公，言不及义，对他个人的问题很有兴趣，对政治问题、工作问题、群众疾苦问题兴趣淡薄，好像不值得他认真关心似的。他们有时候也很积极，但多半是以个人得失作标准。个人主义的霉点，有时晒晒太阳，比如经过党和群众的批评教育就少一些；党和群众的监督稍为放松，就会继续发展。因此，他们如果不痛下决心，改正缺点错误，就有不能继续作共产党员的危险。
    以上三种情况，只是就最突出的表现说的。第一、第二两种情况的人，在我们的同志中占大多数，第三种情况的人虽有一定的数量，但在干部中只占少数。当然，也有的人有时进步、有时落后，在两种情况之间摇摆，不很稳定。我们所以作这样一种分析，只是为了便于说明情况。希望更多的同志经过努力，不断进步，大家都成为革命意志旺盛的人。
    此外，在整风中还揭露出一些党内右派分子、混入党内的坏分子、严重违法乱纪分子、不可救药的腐化堕落分子，有严重的资产阶级个人主义思想和行为、屡教不改的分子。他们确实是思想上政治上已经腐烂了的人，他们是什么性都有，就是没有党性，什么主义都有，就是没有共产主义。在他们看来，他们无负于任何人，倒是党和人民一百个对他们不起。他们经常胡作非为，利用各种机会损害党和人民的利益。这种人虽然在党内占极少数，但是往往为害很大。党在广大群众的帮助下，揭露了并且从党内清除了这些坏分子，这是整风运动的一个重要收获。
    党的干部的这种种情况说明：我国正处在社会大变动时期，改造旧社会的斗争不可避免地反映到党内来。在社会上有过社会主义这一关的问题，在我们党内也有过社会主义这一关的问题。那些右派分子和其他坏分子过不了这一关，这已经为事实所证明了；另外一些同志，比如思想上开始发霉的人，能不能过这一关，也是一个值得他们加以思索的问题。
    我们党的干部绝大多数对党对人民是忠诚的，他们早已立志为共产主义事业奋斗到底。他们中间的许多人经过了长时期斗争的锻炼和考验，在社会主义革命时期的表现也很好。他们对过社会主义这一关是有比较充分的精神准备的。但是，不能认为我们全体党员对过社会主义这一关都有了充分的精神准备。有些人，他们原来就是混进党内来的坏人，他们只想混过关去，现在被揭露出来了，混不过去了。还有些人，原来是抱着赞同我们党的民主革命纲领的态度来参加党的，一到同党走完了民主革命这段路，他们便不愿前进了。有一些同志虽然接受了社会主义革命纲领，但是由于骄傲自满，不认真研究中央的方针政策，不接近劳动群众，不接近基层工作，思想水平和工作水平总是提不高，在革命的大风浪中，有时被胜利冲昏头脑，有时又被胜利吓昏头脑。还有一些人，在新的条件下经受不住资产阶级思想的腐蚀，变成资产阶级个人主义、资产阶级阴谋手段和资产阶级生活方式的俘虏。
    不能说党对这种现象没有发出过警号。党中央和毛泽东同志早就指出过，社会主义这一关并不是很容易过的。还在1949年人民民主革命胜利的前夕，毛泽东同志在党的七届二中全会上就警告过我们，要预防在资产阶级的糖衣炮弹前打败仗。毛泽东同志指出：“敌人是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。”毛泽东同志这段话，虽然是就全国胜利后我们要遇到资产阶级的捧场说的，而实际的含义，也就是指明社会主义这一历史关头就要到来了，比较资产阶级民主革命的历史关头，对相当多的一些同志说来，是更严重的考验。因为我们在社会主义革命这一历史关头所遇到的对手是资产阶级。资产阶级不但可以拿糖弹、拿阴谋手段来打败我们队伍中的某些人，而且还可以凭它的广泛的社会关系，凭它同小资产阶级上层分子和小资产阶级广大群众中一部分至今尚未觉悟的人们一起对我们党的包围，凭资产阶级个人主义和资产阶级生活方式在社会上的影响，凭党内右派分子和其他坏分子在党内向党的进攻和腐蚀作用，征服我们队伍中的那些意志薄弱的分子，征服那些在政治上不坚定的共产党人。
    大家知道，目前的国际环境和国内条件，总的说来，是有利于我们在十五年左右的时间内把我国建成为一个社会主义强国的。连英国的泰晤士报也不得不承认不到十五年工夫英国就要落在我们后面。但是，天下事要人去做的，在客观条件具备之后，成功和失败的关键，就在主观能动作用了。这就是我们不惜花许多时间来讨论革命意志问题的缘故。我们共产党人要做推动社会主义事业前进的促进派，不能做促退派。所以，必须时刻克服资产阶级个人主义的侵袭，保持旺盛的革命意志，为社会主义事业贡献出我们的一切，努力做一个无愧于共产党人光荣称号的好党员。为此，我们认为采取下列措施是完全必要的。
    第一、必须通过整风运动和经常工作，认真地加强对党员干部的政治思想教育。
    为了使所有的干部，能够胜利地过社会主义这一关，除了叛徒和严重违法乱纪分子之外，在整风运动中，党必须保护一切党团员，用大力用诚心帮助他们改正缺点错误。必须教育所有党员、干部一定要有朝气，一定要有旺盛的革命意志，一定要有大公无私、全心全意地为人民服务的精神。对所有党团员，要帮助他们改善工作方法，提高工作能力，提高思想政治水平。也就是说，必须使我们全体同志再经受一次深刻的实际的社会主义的锻炼，以适应社会主义革命和社会主义建设的需要。
    在目前的着重整改阶段和即将到来的第四阶段，必须着重地反对官僚主义、宗派主义（包括地方主义和本位主义）和主观主义，同时还要彻底地批判右倾思想，批判个人主义、自由主义、无政府主义和平均主义，批判民族主义。对于革命意志衰退、消极落后的党员，也必须严加批判，重者还应绳之以纪律。对党内右派分子及其他坏分子，必须按照中央规定的原则和手续，同党外右派分子及其他坏分子一视同仁地严肃处理。但是对于一切受处分的人，也仍然要关怀他们，帮助他们进步。
    总之，在这次整风中，每个党员都要从政治上、思想上普遍地进行一次自我检查。全民整风运动已被实践证明是一个发动群众、依靠群众进行自我教育和自我改造的最好方法。今后应按照中央指示，每年或每两年整风一次，以便保证我们党经常处于广大群众的监督中，永远不脱离群众，不脱离实际，永远朝气蓬勃地前进。
    但是，我们知道，过渡时期是一个大转变的时期，革命形势的发展是日新月异的，干部的政治思想情况也在经常不断地变化，所以，除了依靠整风运动外，更重要的是在平时认真抓紧干部的政治思想教育工作。应该认真组织全体干部学习时事、学习党的重大政策方针，并须深入地开展辩论，借以帮助干部深刻地了解当前政治方向和领会党的重大政策方针的精神实质；应该引导干部（特别是各级领导干部）把剩余精力主要放在钻研马克思列宁主义、丰富科学文化知识上；应该协助领导干部每年划出一定的工作时间，到先进工作单位参观，到邻近省区交流经验，借以取得生动的实际工作知识，扩大眼界，开拓胸襟。凡是政治生活不健全的地方必须健全起来；凡是纪律松懈的地方必须加强；凡是成分不纯的基层党组织必须整顿。
    第二、要使全党所有干部，首先是领导干部，密切同基层群众的联系，密切同斗争实际的联系，借以不断地改造自己的主观世界。今后除了按照中央指示继续从工人、农民中的优秀分子中选拔干部外，同样应当从经过生产锻炼的、同劳动群众有密切联系的知识分子中选拔干部。根据“全面锻炼、统一安排”的方针，各级领导干部，都必须经过体力劳动和实际斗争的锻炼，取得基层工作的经验，缺这一课的必须补上这一课。凡是没有经过体力劳动和实际斗争锻炼、没有基层工作经验的知识分子干部和其他干部都应当到农村、工厂去劳动几年，或者到基层去做几年工作，真正同工农群众打成一片。
    应当强调指出：这是一项重大的革命措施。只有认真地贯彻执行这个方针，我们才能够建立一支为共产主义奋斗的经得起风险的干部队伍。我们相信，大多数下放干部不但自己可以锻炼得很好，他们还会帮助党外同志也锻炼得很好。但是，我们也应当向下放干部说清楚，到农村、到基层去锻炼，这对每个同志本人来说是一个思想革命，没有充分的革命自觉和坚决的改造自己的决心，就不能收到预期的效果。多数人是自觉地下去的，他们迫切地要求下去，在得到批准以后，他们兴奋愉快地投入到火热的体力劳动和实际斗争中、投入到广大群众中去了。但也有些人不完全自觉，或者是带着一些不正确的思想下去的。比如说：“反正薪金照发，下去几年镀镀金再回来。”我们说：下去是可以锻炼人的，但结果如何，在很大程度上决定于自己的革命自觉、革命决心和革命毅力。我们相信大多数可以在锻炼中得到巨大的进步，但也有少数人，如果不下决心认真改正自己的毛病，他们就不但不能“几年后回来”，而且将失去当干部的资格。我们应当采取各种措施，加强对下放干部的政治思想教育，帮助他们，使所有下去的同志，都抱定坚强的决心，把自己锻炼成生龙活虎般的共产主义战士。不但对现在已经下去的同志，对于将来下去的也应该这样做，应当对他们负责，决不允许放任不管。
    在职干部也必须解决这个重新锻炼自己的问题。除了应当采取轮流下去劳动锻炼外，对在职干部也应当定出一些办法，使他们在工作岗位上也能参加体力劳动，也能接近实际，接近基层。因此，市委认为，应当首先规定：每个领导干部，包括市委领导同志，每年应有四个月深入基层，联系群众，联系实际，直接帮助下级，取得经验。半年各下去两个月或一次下去四个月或每周下去两天都可以，但必须作为固定制度，坚决执行。领导干部每星期四不开会，下基层工作和参加一部分体力劳动的制度，除极少数特殊情况外，必须坚持。各个机关、学校、部队、企业的负责同志，必须建立一个经常同基层联系的制度，经常了解他们的情况，研究他们的工作，在他们有困难的时候，帮助他们想办法解决。
    第三、要使广大干部逐步地作到“又红又专”，成为红色专家。红指政治，专指业务，政治和业务是对立的统一。但政治是统帅，政治要统率业务；政治又是业务的保证，上层建筑是为经济基础服务的。只专不红，没有正确的政治观点，等于没有灵魂。只注意业务，不注意政治，光会算账，不讲思想，光搞物质基础，不进行社会主义教育，就要迷失方向，成为资产阶级思想的俘虏。因此，必须批判不问政治的倾向，使所有业务干部注意政治，不作迷失方向的经济专家、技术专家。同时也必须批判不学习业务的倾向，使所有干部努力钻研业务，力求成为业务上的内行，不作空头政治家。我们需要一支宏大的又红又专的干部队伍，否则，业务部门许多问题上的两条道路的斗争，资本主义同社会主义谁战胜谁的问题，就难于真正解决。现在有些同志以为自己已经红了，或者已经专了，或者自己已经又红又专了，其实又红又专是没有止境的，一自满就会退步。我们的同志必须有革命的雄心，振作精神，下苦功，学习马克思主义，学习政治，学习科学文化，学习业务，不是为了追逐个人名利，而是为了无产阶级的事业。堡垒是要人攻的，时间是靠人挤的，除了到学校进修，主要靠在职学习。各个部门都应作出规划，务期在十年内造就一大批又红又专的红色专家，以便在各个战线上真正建立和进一步巩固无产阶级的领导权。
    第四、我们还要从组织上保证干部的积极性和创造性的发挥。随着建设事业的大踏步跃进，应该下放的权力，必须坚决下放，以便广大干部得以大胆、主动地进行工作。某些现在看来应该修改或废除的管理制度，必须坚决改变，以便广大干部可以果敢地放手去搞工作。今后各级党组织应当根据中央所指示的统一领导、分工负责的原则，改善我们的组织工作，并订出相应的工作制度，以适应社会主义建设事业迅速发展的需要。

    中央指出：我国工人阶级和我国人民在今后十年到十五年的基本任务，就是要在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行工农业同时并举的方针，把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。在十五年后，苏联的工业在最重要的产品和产量方面可能赶上或者超过美国。我国应当争取在同一期间，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。那样，社会主义世界就将把帝国主义国家远远地抛在后面。
    党中央的号召给全党和全国人民极大的鼓舞，给上海的男女工人、劳动者和各界人民极大的鼓舞，一个新的生产高潮和科学文化建设的高潮业已到来。
    为了在全民整风运动的基础上，进一步动员和组织全党和全上海人民的力量，团结一切可以团结的力量，争取提前和超额完成第二个五年计划，实现上述的伟大目标，市委特提出以下十二条任务，号召上海各级党组织、全体党员、共青团员和全上海人民以空前高涨的政治热情和劳动热情促其实现：
    第一，大力发展工业生产。（1）上海工业总产值，在第二个五年计划期末，比第一个五年计划期末增长100％以上。
  （2）有计划有步骤地对上海工业实行技术上、组织上的改造，一方面要把原有企业的优点（因陋就简、协作灵活等）保持下来，一方面又要逐步采用新技术，合理调整组织，使上海发展成为化学工业、精密机械、仪表、电讯器材、小型钢材、船舶修造、轻纺工业高级产品、各种文化用品和文化精制品等现代化工业基地。（3）一般轻工业、纺织工业、机电工业、化学工业部门要根据具体情况，争取若干质量较低的主要产品在第二、第三两个五年计划期间逐步地赶上或者超过英国或美国同类产品的质量水平。（4）加强对基本建设的领导，调动一切力量，争取按时完成和提早投入生产。必须根据勤俭建国的方针，反对浪费，保证工程质量。（5）贯彻执行民主办社、勤俭办社的原则，继续整顿和巩固手工业合作社，积极发展对国计民生有利和有广大国外市场的手工业。（6）改善和发展交通运输事业，更好地为生产服务。（7）加强劳动力调配工作的领导，第二个五年计划期间工业生产的增长主要依靠原有职工劳动生产率的提高和劳动力的合理调配。新建企业需要的职工应从劳动力多余的行业中抽调。大部分行业应当加强技术组织措施，以充分发挥现有劳动力的作用。
    第二，争取“全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）”的提前实现。这个伟大纲领的实现，不但将使我国农业生产大跃进，农民生活更富裕，而且将有力地促进工业的迅速发展。上海党组织和上海人民应当：（1）在中央的统筹安排下，发展工业生产，改进商业工作，供应农业生产所需要的物美价廉的农具、肥料、水利设备和生活必需品；加强科学研究工作，调配人力，支援全国的农业生产。（2）充分利用上海的有利条件，争取在第二个五年计划期间在上海郊区基本上实现“全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）”所规定的各项任务。其中粮棉产量，在正常年景下，还应当大大超过纲要中所规定的指标。争取在五年内，粮食每亩平均年产量达到一千五百斤到二千斤，皮棉每亩平均年产量达到一百五十斤到二百斤。1958年要抓紧植树造林，争取市区和郊区早日绿化。要使海边绿化成片，市内外绿化成线。郊区农业的机械化、电气化也应早日作出规划，争取提早实现。（3）市区和郊区人民应当互相支援、互相帮助，提前把上海市郊建成富裕的幸福的社会主义新农村，保证逐步改善市区人民的蔬菜和其他副食品的供应。
    第三，厉行节约，反对浪费。（1）对各部门财务拨款照预算数预扣5％上缴国家，要求以95％的钱，办好用100％的钱办的事。（2）企业提成要用得得当，年终结余不准乱花。（3）加强工厂企业财务管理，精简非生产人员，减少管理费用，降低生产成本，争取超额完成国家收入计划，为国家积累更多的建设资金，以更大的力量支援全国社会主义建设。（4）将勤俭建国、勤俭持家的精神推广到每个工厂、企业、合作社、机关、学校和每家每户，养成新的社会风气。从办最大的事业到私人办红白喜事，都以节俭为光荣。
    第四，加强同邻近各省的经济协作。在技术、资金等方面支援各地开采小型煤、铁、有色金属等矿藏，开发山区，建立某些轻工业原料和副食品基地，改善对上海工业原料和副食品的供应工作，促进经济的共同高涨。
    第五，继续完成社会主义改造，巩固和扩大社会主义统一战线。继续贯彻执行“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，壮大左派，巩固对中间分子的领导，孤立和分化右派。

    彻底完成对资本主义所有制的社会主义改造工作，加强以企业为基地的对资产阶级分子的改造工作。公私合营企业的定息制度，必须按照中央的规定及时废除；部分经销代销户中存在着严重的资本主义经营倾向必须纠正；非法的地下工场必须取缔；国家需要的工场必须登记；盲目自发的小商小贩队伍必须整顿；某些资产阶级分子投机取巧、违法乱纪的行为必须肃清。通过认真的经常的思想教育工作，逐步解决资产阶级分子真正接受党的领导，走社会主义道路，接受工人监督、接受劳动锻炼，逐步改变生活作风，逐步缩短生活水平和劳动群众的距离等等一系列的重大政治问题，使他们在社会主义过渡时期内改造成为真正自食其力的劳动者。
    第六，繁荣科学文化，争取在十年内造成一支宏大的工人阶级知识分子的队伍。（1）争取在五年内，基本上普及小学教育，扫除青壮年文盲。（2）在五年内，要使大、中、小学及其他文化事业单位都有坚强的领导核心。（3）在十年内，大学生中工农成份要达到70％以上，劳动好的青年应优先录取。

    第七，开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。除四害的任务，在上海的具体条件下是除七害。争取三年内使上海市区和郊区基本上无蚊、无蝇、无鼠、无雀、无臭虫、无蟑螂、无钉螺，五年内彻底做到，并坚持到子孙万代。市区有条件的地方，1958年就应当彻底作到。同时，使家家户户讲究清洁卫生，加强医疗预防，发展体育运动，发展医药事业，争取提前根除血吸虫病、疟疾、钩虫病、血丝虫病，提高人民的健康水平。同时加强同严重危害牲畜和农作物的各种病害、虫害作斗争，争取早日肃清病害、虫害。
    第八，根据从六亿人口出发、统筹兼顾的精神，在发展生产的基础上，按照国家规定的指标，使大多数职工的生活逐步有所改善。加强市政建设规划工作，根据因陋就简的原则，逐步改善。对全市房屋紧张问题，采取适当调剂，充分利用，纠正房租畸轻畸重现象并取缔不交房租白住房屋的行为，疏散一部分不必要居住市区的人口，恢复一部分因历次战争毁坏的住宅等办法，逐步求得合理解决。根据少花钱、多办事的原则，合理地使用现有福利经费，并加强对职工家属的工作，依靠群众的力量，逐步改善职工福利事业。

    市委和各级党组织应在这次党代表大会确定以上各项方针任务后，分别定出1958年和今后五年的工业、手工业、农业、副业、交通、商业（包括物价）、科学、文教、卫生（包括除七害）、财政（包括金融）、劳动工资（包括人口）、市政建设
  （包括绿化）等规划，先粗后细，半年搞好，每年修改一次，逐步达到完善。
    代表同志们！
    我们正处在一个全世界由资本主义向社会主义过渡的伟大时代。现在，世界形势正在进入一个新的转折点：以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，不但在人心归向、人口众多、发展迅速方面，而且在若干最重要的科学技术方面，确定地超过了以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的力量。正如毛泽东同志所说，现在是东风压倒西风，而不是西风压倒东风。
    在这样一个新形势下，我们有一个共同的感觉：能够作一个共产主义的战士是很光荣的。但是，正如党中央所教导我们的，我们所取得的伟大成就，不过是万里长征走完了第一步。为了把我们的事业进行到最后胜利，我们还需要继续解决两个阶级、两条道路谁战胜谁的任务，我们还需要继续向自然界进行伟大的斗争。在这种情况下，党的领导的责任、共产党员的责任，毫无疑问是更加重大了。
    为了实现我们面临的任务，可以有两种方法：一种方法是使事情作得快一些、好一些，另一种方法是使事情作得慢一些、差一些。我们应当采取哪一种方法呢？事实证明：愈来愈多的同志采取了前一种方法，拒绝了后一种方法。我们相信：经过我们这次会议的充分讨论，会有更多的同志鼓足革命的干劲，正确地贯彻执行又多又快又好又省的勤俭建国方针，加速建设社会主义的新上海的步伐。在这次会议以后，我们大会所提出的任务，还将由各级党组织进行充分的讨论，还将由广大人民进行充分的讨论，他们的无穷无尽的智慧必将汇集起来，成为无穷无尽的力量，必将推动建设社会主义新上海的事业更加突飞猛进。
    中国有一句著名的古话，叫作“乘风破浪”。我想很可以用这句话来描写我们目前的形势和任务。我们的前面有浪，这就是我们在建设社会主义事业中所必然遇到的各种困难。但是我们的后面有风，这就是广大的党员群众和人民群众的日益高涨的革命积极性。这是一股具有无限潜力的风，这是一股不可抗拒的风。只要我们坚决依靠群众的这种革命积极性，我们就一定能够克服我们前进道路上的任何困难。让我们用乘风破浪的革命气概勇敢前进！我们一定能够加速建设社会主义的新上海，一定能够加速完成党中央交给我们的一切任务，一定能够在建设强大的社会主义祖国的事业中作出更大的贡献。胜利一定是属于我们的！
