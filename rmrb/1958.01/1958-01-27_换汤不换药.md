Notes

    New Bottle, Same Old Wine
    British Prime Minister Macmillan told reporters in New Zealand that only "equilibrium of power" can "deter war." This is just another version of "arming for negotiation." In the final analysis, it cannot be separated from the "strength" policy.
    People have heard quite a lot about the British government's "peace" tune; every time, they always hear him advocating for expanding armaments and preparing for war at the same time. The policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war has never guaranteed peace; on the contrary, it always leads to war in the end. Whether using the slogan of "negotiation" or the sign of "deterring war," they cannot whitewash the fact that Western countries continue the arms race policy, which endangers peace.

    换汤不换药
    英国首相麦克米伦在新西兰对记者说，只有“势均力敌”，才能“遏止战争”。这和“武装起来谈判”是异曲同工。归根结蒂，离不了“实力”政策。
    人们听到英国政府首脑唱“和平”的调子已经不少了；每一次，总在同时听到他鼓吹扩军备战。扩军备战的政策，从来没有保障过和平，相反，总是最后导致战争。用“谈判”口号也好，用“遏止战争”的牌子也好，都粉饰不了西方国家继续军备竞赛政策这个危害和平的事实。
