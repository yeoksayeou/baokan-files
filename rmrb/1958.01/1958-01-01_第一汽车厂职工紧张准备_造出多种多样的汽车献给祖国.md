Workers at the First Automobile Works, having already overfulfilled their production tasks for the first Five-Year Plan, completed their final preparations for next year's production today. The workers happily cleaned the workshops, removed the old slogans from the steel beams, replaced them with huge new slogans such as "Launch a new production upsurge to welcome the second Five-Year Plan!" and "Exert revolutionary vigor to achieve multi-variety automobile production!", and placed red flags around them.

The machines lined up on the hundreds of assembly lines have all been washed clean and coated with new oil. The tools are also arranged neatly, waiting for the production bell to ring next year, when all the machines will quickly start running.

The tool workshop, with the most urgent production tasks, has already produced all the tools needed for the production of "Liberation" brand automobiles in the first half of next year.

In the engineering building, designers are continuing to work intensely on the design of more than ten new types of vehicles, such as small sedans, dump trucks, and tractors. The trial production workshop is busy trial-producing a new heavy-duty vehicle, based on the first design plan for an improved Liberation brand automobile, which will be lighter in weight, have greater traction, and have a greater load capacity than the current "Liberation" brand automobile.

    第一汽车厂职工紧张准备
    造出多种多样的汽车献给祖国
    已经提前完成第一个五年计划超产任务的第一汽车制造厂职工，今天最后做好了明年的生产准备工作。工人们兴高采烈地清扫了车间，从钢梁上取下旧标语，换上“掀起新的生产高潮，迎接第二个五年计划！”“鼓足革命劲头，实现多品种汽车生产！”等巨幅新标语，并且在周围插上了红旗。
    排列在几百条流水生产线上的机器，都已经洗刷干净，敷上了新油，工具也安置得整整齐齐，只待来年生产铃响，全部机器就将迅速地转动起来。
    生产任务最紧张的工具车间，今天已经把明年上半年生产“解放牌”汽车所需要的工具，全部生产出来。
    在工程大楼里，设计人员正在继续紧张地进行小卧车、翻斗车、牵引车等十多种新型车的设计工作。试制车间正忙着按改进型解放牌汽车第一个设计方案，试制一辆比现在的“解放牌”汽车重量更轻、牵引力更大、负荷量更大的新载重汽车。
