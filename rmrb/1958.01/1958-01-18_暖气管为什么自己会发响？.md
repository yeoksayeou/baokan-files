Why do heating pipes make noise on their own?

In rooms with heating, you can often hear a steady knocking sound, like someone is hitting the pipes. Why does this sound occur frequently?

Heating uses heating pipes to transport steam from the boiler room to the radiators. During the transport process, the steam cools and condenses into water droplets, which gradually expand into a "water plug" that blocks the heating pipe. However, the steam continues to press towards the radiator at a high speed, causing the steam and the "water plug" to collide, producing a sound. The heating pipe, as a solid, transmits sound louder than gas, making it sound like someone is hitting the heating pipe (known as "water hammer"). (Wang)

### 暖气管为什么自己会发响？

    暖气管为什么自己会发响？
    在装有暖气的房间里，常常可以听到噹噹……的均匀的敲击声，好像有人在敲击管子一样。为什么经常会有这种声音呢？
    暖气是用暖气管子把蒸汽从锅炉房输送到暖气片里来的。在输送的过程中，由于蒸汽遇冷，凝结成水滴，并且逐渐扩大成一个塞子一样（称为“水塞”）把暖气管堵住。但是蒸汽却继续以很大速度压向暖气片，于是蒸汽与“水塞”就发生了碰撞，发出声音。暖气管作为固体传声，比气体传声更响，听起来好像是有人在敲击暖气管一样（称为“水击”）。　（王）
