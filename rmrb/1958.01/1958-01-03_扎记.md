    Jottings
    Retreating After Success
    Dulles personally led a delegation to attend the Baghdad Pact Council meeting. One of his goals was likely to make up for his failure at the Paris conference and ease the criticism against him from domestic public opinion in the United States. However, the American "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" believed that Dulles' way to achieve success lies in "stepping down." The newspaper wrote that Dulles' resignation would be "a great contribution to the United States and its allies."
    The ancients spoke of "retreating after success," but for Dulles, it is "retreating to achieve success"!
    An Unprepared Ambush
    Recently, British newspapers have been extremely indignant about the United States snatching away West German orders from British aircraft companies. British newspapers complained: This is a "strange annotation on the spirit of cooperation" of the Paris conference.
    In fact, in the capitalist world, the law of competition of "big fish eating small fish" has long become common knowledge. The American "big fish" snatching a piece of food from the mouth of the British "small fish" is merely an example of the concrete application of this law. This is not surprising at all. It's just strange that the cunning British gentlemen, while chanting "interdependence" with the United States, did not guard against this kind of ambush from their "allies."
    Futile and Useless
    According to news from the "New York Times," the United States plans to drastically reduce the number of American technical personnel conducting "technical assistance programs" in underdeveloped countries in the next two years. It is said that this was Nixon's idea, because after the American Vice President visited the Far East and Africa last year, he was "convinced that there are too many Americans abroad, too conspicuous, and thus often arouse resentment towards the United States."
    In fact, the reason why this resentment arises is certainly not because there are a few more American technical personnel. The problem lies in the fact that the American "aid" policy makes these American personnel a symbol of foreign enslavement for the "recipient countries." The U.S. government now intends to reduce some conspicuous personnel to cover up the enslaving essence of American "aid," which can only be a futile effort.

    引退功成
    杜勒斯亲自率领代表团去出席巴格达集团理事会会议，目的之一可能是因为在巴黎会议碰了壁之后企图在另一方面立回一功，以缓和美国国内舆论对他的责难。但是美国“圣路易邮报”认为杜勒斯立功之道在于“下台”。这家报纸写道，杜勒斯辞职，那将是他“对美国和他的盟国作出的一大功劳”。
    古人有“功成引退”之说，而对于杜勒斯来说，却是“引退功成”！
    未加防备的暗算
    最近英国报纸对于美国抢走英国飞机公司的西德订货的事，极为愤慨。英国报纸埋怨道：这是对于巴黎会议的“合作精神的奇怪的注解。”
    其实，在资本主义世界里，“大鱼吃小鱼”的竞争规律早已成为妇孺皆知的常识。美国“大鱼”抢掉英国“小鱼”嘴里的一块食物，不过是这种规律的具体运用的一个例子而已。这丝毫也不值得奇怪。怪只怪老谋深算的英国绅士在同美国高唱什么“相互依赖”的时候，竟没有防备他们的“盟国”的这种暗算。
    徒劳无益
    据“纽约时报”的消息，美国准备在今后两年中大量减少在不发达国家进行“技术援助计划”的美国技术人员的人数。据说这是尼克松出的主意，因为这位美国副总统去年访问了远东和非洲以后，“深信国外美国人太多了，太惹人注目了，因而时常引起人们对美国的怨恨”。
    其实这种怨恨之所以产生，当然不是因为多了几个美国技术人员。问题是在于，美国的“援助”政策使得这种美国人员对于“受援国”说来成了一种外国奴役的象征。美国政府现在打算减少一些惹人注目的人员，来掩盖美国“援助”的奴役实质，这只能是徒劳无益的努力。
