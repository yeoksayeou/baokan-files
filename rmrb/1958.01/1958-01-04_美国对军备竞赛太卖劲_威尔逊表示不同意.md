Xinhua News Agency, 3rd (Detroit dispatch): Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson told reporters on January 1st that he disagreed with the United States being so enthusiastic about the arms race. He said he did not feel that the United States was currently in danger of being attacked.

Wilson is considered in the United States to be a representative figure of a capitalist group with fewer ties to military-industrial interests. When talking about the Soviet Union's launched artificial earth satellite, he said: The artificial satellite is a "sign of the progress made by the Soviet Union as a powerful industrial country." He believes that the Soviet satellite does not threaten the security of the United States.

    美国对军备竞赛太卖劲
    威尔逊表示不同意
    新华社3日讯　底特律消息：美国前国防部长威尔逊在1月1日向记者说，他不同意美国在军备竞赛上那样卖力气。他说，他感觉不到美国在目前有遭到进攻的危险。
    威尔逊在美国是被认为同军事工业利益关系较少的资本家集团的代表人物。他在谈到苏联发射的人造地球卫星时说：人造卫星是苏联“作为一个强大的工业国所取得的进步的征兆”。他认为，苏联卫星并没有威胁到美国的安全。
