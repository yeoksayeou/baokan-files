    Completing Twenty Months' Workload in One Year, Fifteen Consecutive Years Without Defective Products
    Excellent Lathe Operators Zhan Shuijing and Zhang Riliang Make a Guarantee

    (Our Newspaper dispatch) Zhan Shuijing, Special-Grade Labor Model of Lüda City and excellent lathe operator of Dalian Shipyard, recently, together with Zhang Riliang, the worker who alternates shifts with him on the lathe, made a guarantee to all factory workers to complete twenty months of work in 1958, the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan. In their guarantee, they also mentioned that they would guarantee no rework or defective products during the Second Five-Year Plan period, and that they would propose eighty rationalization suggestions and save six hundred cutting tools.
    Zhan Shuijing and Zhang Riliang are both veteran workers at the Dalian Shipyard and both are Communist Party members. As of November 25th of last year, Zhan Shuijing had not produced a single defective product for ten consecutive years. During the First Five-Year Plan period, he completed seven years and six months' worth of work in just four years and ten months. He not only produced well himself, but also motivated all the workers in the group to consistently overfulfill the state plan and reduce defective products and rework. Last year, the two of them averaged 157% of the monthly workload, and this year, they only need to complete 170% of the monthly workload to fulfill this new guarantee. (Wang Qiyu)

    一年完成二十个月工作量  连续十五年不出废品
    优秀车工詹水晶和张日良提出保证
    本报讯　旅大市特等劳动模范、大连造船厂优秀车工詹水晶最近和他同车床换班的工人张日良一起，向全厂职工提出了在第二个五年计划第一年——1958年完成二十个月工作量的保证。他俩在保证书中还提到，要在第二个五年计划期间保证不出一件返手活和废品，并且要提合理化建议八十件，节约刀具六百把。
    詹水晶和张日良都是大连造船厂的老工人，两个人都是共产党员。詹水晶到去年11月25日止，已经连续十年没有出一件废品。在第一个五年计划期间，他仅用四年零十个月的时间就完成了七年零六个月的工作量。他不仅自己生产得好，还带动全组工人经常超额完成国家计划，减少了废品和返手活。去年他们两个人平均每个月都能完成157％的工作量，今年他们只要做到每月完成170％的工作量，就可以实现这个新保证。　（王其余）
