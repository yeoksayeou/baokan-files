Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Special Dispatch: A responsible person from the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, when speaking to our reporter about the significance of Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School's implementation of the policy of diligence and thrift in running the school and practicing semi-work and semi-study to achieve self-sufficiency, said: This school has set a vivid example for us in running similar schools, and it embodies the fundamental direction of our socialist education cause.

The responsible person of the Provincial Party Committee said: There should be a fundamental difference between how we run schools and how the bourgeoisie run schools. The experience of this school has the following three characteristics, which precisely embody the fundamental principles of our school management. First, adhering to the policy of running the school diligently and thriftily, implementing semi-work and semi-study, inheriting the fine tradition of diligence and thrift in learning from the Chinese working people, and inheriting and carrying forward the glorious tradition of diligence and thrift in running schools and hard work in our past revolutionary base areas. This practice specifically implements the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, which is in line with our requirements for hard work in building socialism. Second, Marx said long ago in his Critique of the Gotha Program: "The early combination of productive labor and education is one of the most powerful means of transforming modern society." This school closely combines labor and education. The learning process is a combination of mental and physical labor, and it also combines vocational education with political education. This cultivates talents with a firm labor perspective and skilled labor techniques. Third, theory is closely integrated with practice, and classroom education is closely integrated with internships. This not only does not reduce the quality of teaching, but improves the quality of teaching, enabling students to quickly master labor skills. Precisely because of this, the achievement of this school is not only to save the country a lot of money, but more importantly, to train builders of socialism with high political awareness who are both red and expert. After the students of this school were assigned to various factories, all units unanimously reflected that their advantages are hard work, simplicity, skilled technology, and high awareness.

The responsible person of the Provincial Party Committee criticized the ideological style of running schools of the bourgeoisie in some local schools, to varying degrees. They are divorced from our country's current reality and from our country's construction reality. They seek novelty and greed for bigness when building schools, emphasizing the need for modern school buildings and modern teaching equipment, which makes the country spend a lot of money that should not be spent on running education. Particularly serious is that in teaching, they one-sidedly emphasize theoretical teaching and neglect practical labor exercises; they excessively emphasize business and technical learning and neglect political and ideological education. As a result, students' political quality is not high, and they cannot withstand the test of revolutionary storms; they do not have practical operation skills in technology. Some technicians trained by some technical schools in Shaanxi, for this reason, after being assigned to factories, some people are unwilling to use outdated old equipment and are unwilling to do so-called "rough work" such as casting and forging. They are arrogant and think highly of themselves, and they cannot make sophisticated products themselves, and they look down on experienced old workers and do not humbly learn technology from master workers. A bourgeois enjoyment ideology gradually grows in their minds, haggling over wages and making trouble over grades. The formation of this situation is completely related to the education of those schools. Good flowers cannot grow in greenhouses. This is proven by the experience of the First Aviation Technical School and some other schools, which deserves our serious attention.

The responsible person of the Provincial Party Committee further pointed out: The experience of Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School is not only the direction that every technical school should learn, but also a model for all schools to learn from when running schools. This approach should not only be done, but also can be done. "It all depends on human effort." Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School can do it under such difficult and backward material conditions, and other schools can certainly do it as well. If all local technical schools and other schools learn from them, it will be a fundamental reform of our education cause and a major change in social atmosphere.

The responsible person of the Provincial Party Committee finally said: At present, all schools have gone through rectification and criticism of the ideological style of running schools and teaching of the bourgeoisie, which has laid the ideological foundation for learning from Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School. Now, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee have begun to organize local schools to successively learn from Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School and vigorously promote their experience.

    陕西省委负责人谈：
    西安第一航空技工学校勤俭办校的做法
    体现了社会主义办学的原则
    应该大力推广，使学校革新，风气大变
    本报特约新华社西安专稿　中共陕西省委负责人向本社记者谈西安第一航空技工学校执行勤俭办校方针，实行半工半读达到自给自足的意义时说：这个学校为我们办同类学校树立了一个生动的榜样，它体现了我们社会主义国家教育事业的根本方向。
    省委负责人说：我们办学校和资产阶级办学校应有原则的区别。这个学校的经验具有下述三个特点，这些特点正体现了我们办学校的根本原则。第一、坚持勤俭办校的方针，实行半工半读，继承了我国劳动人民勤工俭学的优良传统，继承和发扬了我们过去革命根据地勤俭办校艰苦奋斗的光荣传统。这种做法，具体的执行了勤俭建国的方针，正符合我们艰苦奋斗建设社会主义的要求。第二、马克思在哥达纲领批判中早就说过：“生产劳动和教育的早期结合是改造现代社会的最强有力的手段之一”。这个学校把劳动与教育紧密结合起来，学习过程就是脑力劳动与体力劳动结合的过程，同时也把业务教育与政治教育相结合。这就培养了具有坚强劳动观点和熟练劳动技术的人才。第三、理论与实践密切结合，课堂教育和实习密切结合。这样作不但没有降低教学质量，而是提高了教学质量，使学生迅速掌握了劳动技能。正因为这样，这个学校的成就，不仅仅是给国家节省下大量资金，更重要的是为国家培养出具有高度政治觉悟、既红又专的建设社会主义的战士。这个学校学生分配到各个工厂后，各单位都一致反映，他们的优点是吃苦耐劳，艰苦朴素，技术熟练，觉悟高。
    省委负责人批判了当地一些学校办校中，程度不等地沾染了资产阶级办校的思想作风。他们脱离了我国目前的实际，脱离了我国建设的实际。建校时求新贪大，强调要现代化的校舍，现代化的教学设备，使国家在兴办教育事业上花了许多不应该花的钱。特别严重的是在教学中，片面地强调了理论教学，忽视了实际劳动锻炼；过分地强调了业务和技术学习，轻视政治思想教育工作。结果，学生政治质量不高，经不起革命风浪考验；技术上也没有具备实际操作的技能。陕西地区部分技工学校培养出来的一些技术工人，就因为这样，分配到工厂后，有些人不愿意用落后的旧设备，不愿意做铸工、锻工等所谓“粗活”。自高自大，自己既做不成较精密的产品，又看不起有经验的老工人，不虚心向老师傅学习技术。在思想中渐渐滋生着一种资产阶级享受思想，计较工资、闹级别。这种情况的形成，完全与那些学校的教育有关。温室里长不出好花，这是第一航空技工学校和另外一些学校经验所证明的，值得我们严重注意。
    省委负责人进一步指出：西安第一航空技工学校的办校经验，不但是每一个技工学校应该学习的方向，也是所有学校办校时应该学习的榜样。这种做法，不但应当做到，而且也可能做到。“事在人为”，西安第一航空技工学校在那么艰苦、落后的物质条件下能够做到，其他各个学校也一定能够做到。如果当地全部技工学校和其它学校都向他们学习，那末将是我们教育事业的根本性改革，是社会风气的大变化。
    省委负责人最后说：目前各学校经过整风，批判了资产阶级办学和教学的思想作风，这就具备了向西安第一航空技工学校学习的思想基础。现在，中共陕西省委和中共西安市委已着手组织当地的各个学校，陆续到西安第一航空技工学校学习，大力推广他们的经验。
