    Xinhua News Agency, 27th: This year will be an unprecedented year of bumper harvest for capital construction in China's machinery industry. According to materials provided by the State Economic Commission, this year China will have twenty-seven newly built and rebuilt machinery manufacturing plants above the quota completed and put into production.
    The factories to be completed and put into production this year include factories manufacturing heavy-duty machine tools, metallurgical equipment, mining and beneficiation equipment, lifting equipment, ball bearings, forging equipment, tractors, cutting tools, measuring tools, electrical switches and other products. The completion of this batch of factories will have a very significant effect on improving the self-sufficiency of our country's machinery and equipment.
    Some heavy-duty machine tools that have been relying on imports for several years will be produced by the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, which will be put into production this year. The vertical lathes, gear hobbing machines, heavy-duty horizontal boring machines, gantry milling machines, gantry planers and other machine tools produced by this factory are all indispensable products for equipping China's heavy machinery industry and processing large components of heavy equipment such as large motors, locomotives, large blast furnaces, and open-hearth furnaces.
    The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, whose first phase of construction will be completed this year, will produce steel rolling equipment that our country has not been able to manufacture, including complete sets of steel rolling equipment for rolling large sections, medium plates, and seamless steel pipes. This factory can also produce forging equipment including hydraulic presses with a pressure of 2,600 tons, lifting equipment such as large casting cranes with a lifting capacity of 350 tons, and complete sets of coke oven equipment. It can also produce large air compressors for manufacturing nitrogen fertilizer.
    The Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant, which is planned to be completed this year, will produce large mine hoisting equipment, beneficiation equipment and other products for China's coal mines and other mines.
    The tractors that the Chinese people have been waiting for will be manufactured by the Tianjin Tractor Factory, which will be put into production this year.
    The Luoyang Ball Bearing Factory, which will be put into production this year, will change the situation of China's large number of imported balls. The ball bearings produced by this factory are indispensable products for manufacturing machine equipment such as automobiles, tractors, and machine tools.
    After this batch of factories is put into production, the newly added annual production capacity of metallurgical equipment will be more than four times the total amount of metallurgical equipment produced nationwide last year, and the newly added annual production capacity of ball bearings will be more than one time the total amount of ball bearings produced nationwide last year.
    Xinhua News Agency, 27th: This year, the blizzard of incoming orders has freed China's machinery industry from the worry of not having "enough to eat." In the past few dozens of days, China's agriculture, capital construction, industry, and transportation industries have continued to put forward new ordering requirements, prompting the production plans of the machinery industry to be changed again and again. The original plan for the total output of the national machinery industry this year has already increased a lot compared with last year, and now, with the increase in orders, it has been raised to more than 20% higher than last year. However, judging from the current trend, this still cannot meet the urgent needs of the various sectors of the national economy in this year's production and construction.
    An important feature of this year's machinery industry production is that the tasks of producing and trial-manufacturing complete sets of major machinery and equipment are unprecedentedly heavy. The vast majority of the more than 70 major products listed in the national plan will increase production this year. It is estimated that the proportion of complete sets of equipment required for China's 160 key construction projects this year supplied domestically will increase from about 42% last year to about 60%.
    A major task of the machinery industry this year is to provide technical equipment for agriculture, which is undergoing a great leap forward. In the previous period, the national plan was to produce 590,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery for agricultural production this year, of which the planned output of gas generators, which is the largest in quantity, is more than four times that of last year. However, recently, various places have requested to increase the production of irrigation and drainage machinery by tens of thousands of horsepower. Other machines needed for agricultural production, such as waterwheels, tractors, and water pumps, are required to increase production.
    This year's task of producing and trial-manufacturing chemical fertilizer equipment in the machinery industry is also unprecedentedly heavy. The preliminary plan for the production of nitrogen fertilizer equipment this year is equivalent to 5.3 times that of last year; recently, new orders have been added. Producing a large number of complete sets of fertilizer equipment is still a new task for Chinese machinery workers.
    This year, we will also trial-produce complete sets of television equipment and new products such as electronic computers.

    今年是机械工业空前丰收的一年
    二十七座大机械厂将建成
    成套设备和农业机械的生产大大增加
    据新华社27日讯　今年将是我国机械工业基本建设空前丰收的一年。据国家经济委员会提供的材料说，这一年我国将有二十七个限额以上的新建和改建的机械制造厂建成投入生产。
    今年建成投入生产的工厂，包括制造重型机床、冶金设备、矿山采掘洗选设备、起重设备、滚珠轴承、锻压设备、拖拉机、刃具量具、电器开关等产品的工厂。这批工厂的建成，对提高我国机器设备自给程度，有着极其重大的作用。
    几年来一直依靠进口的一些重型机床，将由今年投入生产的武汉重型机床厂生产出来。这个厂生产的立式车床、滚齿机，以及重型卧式搪床、龙门铣床、龙门刨床等机床，都是装备我国重型机械工业、加工像大型电机、机车、大高炉、平炉等重型设备的大部件所不可缺少的产品。
    今年建成第一期工程的太原重型机器厂，将要生产我国还一直不能制造的轧钢设备，其中包括轧制大型型钢、中板、无缝钢管等产品的全套轧钢设备。这个厂还能够生产包括压力二千六百吨的水压机在内的锻压设备，起重能力三百五十吨的大型铸造吊车等起重设备，以及全套的炼焦设备。它还可以生产制造氮肥用的大型空气压缩机。
    计划今年建成的洛阳矿山机械厂，将为我国煤矿和其他矿山生产大型矿井卷扬设备、洗选设备等产　品。
    我国人民盼望已久的拖拉机，将由今年投入生产的天津拖拉机厂开始制造。
    今年建成投入生产的洛阳滚珠轴承厂，将改变我国大量进口滚珠的情况。这个厂生产的滚珠轴承，是制造汽车、拖拉机、机床等机器设备不可缺少的产品。
    这批工厂投入生产以后，新增的冶金设备年产能力，相当于去年全国生产的冶金设备总数的四倍多，新增的滚珠轴承年产能力，相当于去年全国生产的滚珠轴承总数的一倍以上。
    据新华社27日讯　今年，雪片般而来的订货单，已经使我国机械工业部门摆脱了怕“吃不饱”的顾虑。过去几十天里，我国农业、基本建设、工业、交通运输业不断提出新的订货要求，促使机械工业的生产计划一再变更。原来计划的全国机械工业今年的总产量已经比去年增加了很多，现在随着订货的增多，又提高到比去年增长20％以上。但是从现在的趋势看来，这还不能满足国民经济各部门今年生产建设上的迫切需要。
    今年机械工业生产上的重要特色是：成套的重大的机器设备生产和试制的任务都空前繁重。列入国家计划表中的七十多种主要产品，绝大部分今年都要增产。预计今年我国一百六十项重点建设工程所需要的成套设备，由国内供应的比重，将从去年的42％左右提高到60％左右。
    机械工业今年的一项重大任务，是为生产大跃进的农业提供技术装备。前一时期，全国计划今年为农业生产五十九万马力的排灌机械，其中数量最多的煤气机的计划产量，相当于去年的四倍多。但是最近各地又要求再增产十几万马力的排灌机械。其他农业生产上需要的机器，像水车、拖拉机、水泵等，都要求增加生产。
    机械工业今年生产和试制化学肥料设备的任务，也空前繁重。今年初步计划生产的氮肥设备，相当于去年的五点三倍；最近又增加了新的订货。生产大量成套的肥料设备，对我国机械工人来说，还是一件新的工作。
    今年还要试制全套的电视设备，和电子计算机等新的产品。
