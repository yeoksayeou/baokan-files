    According to Cairo newspapers: Anwar al-Sadat, Speaker of the Egyptian National Assembly, said, "This is just the beginning. Next, the people of the countries in this region will achieve further progress and achievements." Sabri, Minister of State for Presidential Affairs, said: "The conference has successfully completed its mission. Its work will have an impact on the future, and in some respects, its impact will not be less than that of the Bandung Conference." Mohieddin, Minister of Interior, said: "Undoubtedly, we are all satisfied with the results of the conference and the resolutions unanimously adopted." He pointed out that this is the result of the awakening of the Asian and African people.

    Damascus: Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali said on January 2nd that the resolutions of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference were "the best resolutions" for Arab countries, Asian and African countries, and the entire mankind. These resolutions are a guarantee for the realization of independence for all countries still suffering from imperialist rule.

    The resolutions and declarations adopted by the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference have been welcomed by all newspapers in Cairo. "The Republic" published an editorial stating that the resolutions of the conference were a new victory for the Asian and African people. These resolutions "spoke of the pain and all the wishes of the people of the Asian and African continents, and affirmed the important fact that the people of Asian and African countries are determined to take action to safeguard world peace."

The Bengali newspaper "Azad" praised the resolutions of the conference, saying that they would "strengthen Asian-African unity in striving to solve world problems." "National Herald" said: "One factor that makes the Cairo Conference so significant is the Soviet Union's willingness to provide Asian and African countries with economic assistance without any conditions attached."

The conference showed the unparalleled unity of the Asian and African people in their struggle to realize the Bandung Conference's historic resolution on the need to eliminate all manifestations of colonialism.
