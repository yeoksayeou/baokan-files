Why Does Black Water Flow from the Chimney of a Foreign Stove?

Why is it that the chimney of a foreign stove often drips some black water with a scorched smell?

Originally, the water in the chimney is condensed from water vapor mixed in the smoke as it gradually cools down. The water vapor in foreign stoves comes from the small amount of moisture contained in the coal or firewood and from the hydrogen-containing compounds in the fuel. When the fuel burns in the stove, the water it contains turns into water vapor when heated; and when hydrogen-containing compounds burn, the hydrogen is oxidized by the oxygen in the air to become water vapor. This water vapor rises with the smoke and slowly cools in the chimney when it encounters cold, condensing on the small particles of soot. It accumulates more and more, and finally slowly flows out of the cracks in the chimney. This is that annoying black water.

This black water, in addition to containing the water and soot mentioned above, also contains some coal tar. The reason why black water is sticky and smelly is because of the coal tar. Although coal tar dripping on people's clothes is annoying, it is a very valuable raw material in industry.

    为什么洋炉子的烟筒中会流出黑水来？
    洋炉子的烟筒，为什么常常会流出一些带有焦灼味的黑水来？
    原来，烟筒里的水，是由混在烟里的水蒸汽逐渐冷却而凝集下来的。洋炉子里的水蒸汽，是因为煤或柴内含有少量水分和燃料中含有氢的化合物。当燃料在炉子里燃烧时，所含的水受热后就变成水蒸汽；而含氢的化合物在燃烧时，氢就被空气中的氧气氧化而变成水蒸汽。这些水蒸汽随烟一道上升，遇冷后，就在烟筒中慢慢地冷却，凝集在烟尘的小颗粒上。愈集愈多，最后便缓缓地从烟囱缝里流了出来。这就是那讨厌的黑水。
    这个黑水中除了含有上面说过的水和烟尘以外，还有一部分是煤焦油。黑水所以又粘又臭，就是因为有煤焦油的缘故。虽然煤焦油滴在人们的衣服上是很讨厌的事，但是在工业上，它却是非常珍贵的原料。
