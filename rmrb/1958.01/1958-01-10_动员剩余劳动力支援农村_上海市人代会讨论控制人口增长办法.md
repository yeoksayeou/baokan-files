Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric Dispatch: At the third session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress held on the 5th and 6th, Vice Mayor Xu Jianguo's report on "Mobilizing Surplus Urban Labor to Support Rural Socialist Construction" was discussed.

The representatives, based on the current surplus labor situation in Shanghai, believed that this measure was completely correct and beneficial to the full utilization and rational development of Shanghai as a coastal industrial base; it is also conducive to improving people's lives. The representatives believed that it is absolutely necessary to gradually control the permanent resident population of Shanghai to around seven million during the Second Five-Year Plan period. During the discussion, the representatives put forward various methods to control population growth, such as government staff and the vast number of workers taking the lead in mobilizing family members and relatives who can return to their hometowns to return to their hometowns for production, promoting household service groups in neighborhoods to reduce the employment of nannies, vigorously promoting birth control, and advocating late marriage. Some representatives also criticized the illegal behavior of many enterprises that still do not comply with the regulations of the State Council and arbitrarily recruit workers from rural areas. They demanded that relevant departments promptly formulate specific and effective measures to eliminate this major loophole.

The more than six hundred representatives present also unanimously passed the resolution to revoke the qualifications of Shen Zhiyuan, Qian Duansheng, Yang Yitang, and Jiang Feng, bourgeois rightists, as deputies to the First National People's Congress in accordance with the law, and the resolution to remove Shen Zhiyuan, a bourgeois rightist, from his post as a member of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee in accordance with the law.

    动员剩余劳动力支援农村
    上海市人代会讨论控制人口增长办法
    新华社上海电　在5、6日举行的上海市第二届人民代表大会第三次会议上，讨论了许建国副市长关于“动员城市剩余劳动力支援农村社会主义建设”的报告。
    代表们根据目前上海劳动力剩余的情况，认为这个措施是完全正确的，有利于上海这个沿海工业基地的充分利用、合理发展；也有利于人民生活的改善。代表们认为在第二个五年计划期间，让上海市常住人口逐步控制在七百万左右是完全必要的。代表们在讨论中提出各种控制人口增长的办法，如国家工作人员和广大职工带头动员可以回乡的家属、亲友回乡生产，里弄中推广家务服务小组减少雇用保姆和大力提倡节育、提倡晚婚等等。有些代表还批评至今仍有不少企业不遵守国务院规定，任意到农村去招收工人的违法行为，他们要求有关部门迅速订出具体的有效措施，杜绝这个大漏洞。
    到会的六百多个代表还一致通过依法撤销资产阶级右派分子沈志远、钱端升、杨逸棠、江丰的第一届全国人民代表大会代表资格的决议，和依法罢免资产阶级右派分子沈志远的上海市人民委员会委员职务的决议。
