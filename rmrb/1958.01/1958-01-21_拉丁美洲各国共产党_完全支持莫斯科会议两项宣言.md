    Latin American Communist Parties
    Fully Support the Two Declarations of the Moscow Conference
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Moscow: The two declarations of the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties have received full support from the Communist Parties of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and other Latin American countries. The party organizations and members in these countries have been discussing and studying these two extremely important documents with great attention.
    The Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party held an enlarged plenary meeting on January 7 and 8. The meeting heard a report from the Argentine Communist Party delegation that participated in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties. It passed a resolution approving the two declarations of the Moscow Conference.
    The speaker, Victorio Codovilla, said that the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties reflected the forward development of the peace and socialism camp. He said: "The declaration adopted in Moscow should be regarded as a historic document because it summarizes the experience of the existence and struggle of the first socialist country over the past forty years in building a socialist society and gradually transitioning to communism. It summarizes the experience of socialist construction in the great People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries, the experience of the communist and workers' movements in various countries of the world, and the results of the implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the fraternal Communist Party of the Soviet Union."
    Codovilla emphasized the significance of the statement that the Communist Party is the vanguard of the working class and its leading and guiding force. He said that international experience shows that the Communist Parties of various countries should be united, theoretically well-versed and organizationally consistent, develop inner-party democracy, implement the principle of democratic centralism, promote criticism and self-criticism, encourage initiative, and not allow the formation of small cliques within the party.
    Codovilla finally talked about the domestic situation in Argentina and the party's basic tasks. He said that the current important tasks of the Communist Party are to intensify the struggle for peace in conjunction with the struggle for freedom and economic and political independence at home.
    The Central Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party passed a special resolution expressing its support for the two documents and recommending that party organizations at all levels and all party members discuss them and consider them in their daily work.
    Progressive newspapers in Latin America—"Voz Operária" (Brazil), "O Popular" (Brazil), "El Popular" (Uruguay), "El Siglo" (Chile), and others—have published many articles commenting on the historical significance of the two declarations. An editorial in Brazil's "Voz Operária" stated that the conference of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries demonstrated the further strengthening of international ties between the Communist and Workers' Parties of the world. The editorial pointed out that the peace declaration signed by sixty-four delegations shows the greatest achievement of the communist movement, calling on the people of all countries to fight for peace and be vigilant against the conspiracies of war blocs. The editorial emphasized that the Moscow Conference and the documents adopted at the conference are a shining proof of the vitality of the international communist movement.
    An article published in Uruguay's "El Popular" wrote that the Uruguayan people, together with all well-intentioned people, will certainly warmly welcome the call of the Communist and Workers' Parties and make their own contributions to the cause of peace.

    拉丁美洲各国共产党
    完全支持莫斯科会议两项宣言
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社讯：各国共产党和工人党莫斯科代表会议的两个宣言受到阿根廷、巴西、乌拉圭、智利和其他拉丁美洲国家共产党的完全支持。这些国家的党组织和党员都以极大的注意力讨论和学习这两个极重要的文件。
    阿根廷共产党中央委员会在1月7日和8日举行扩大全体会议。会议听取了参加十月社会主义革命四十周年庆祝典礼和莫斯科各国共产党和工人党代表会议的阿根廷共产党代表团的报告，并且通过决议，同意莫斯科会议的两项宣言。
    报告人维克托里奥·柯都维亚说，莫斯科各国共产党和工人党代表会议反映了和平和社会主义阵营的向前发展。他说：“应该把莫斯科通过的宣言看作历史性文件，因为它总结了建设社会主义社会并逐步向共产主义过渡的第一个社会主义国家四十年来存在和斗争的经验。它总结了伟大的中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的社会主义建设的经验，总结了世界各国共产主义和工人运动的经验以及兄弟般的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会决议的实施结果。”
    柯都维亚强调指出了共产党是工人阶级的先锋队、是工人阶级的领导和指导力量这句话的意义。他说，国际经验表明，各国共产党应当是团结的，理论上有充分修养并且组织上是一致的，应当发扬党内民主，依据民主集中制原则，发扬批评与自我批评，鼓励积极性，不许在党内形成小集团。
    柯都维亚最后谈到阿根廷的国内情况和党的基本任务。他说，共产党目前的重要任务是：结合在国内争取自由、争取经济与政治独立的斗争，加紧争取和平的斗争。
    巴西共产党中央委员会通过了一项专门决议，表示拥护这两项文件，并建议各级党组织和全体党员进行讨论和在日常工作中考虑这两个文件。
    拉丁美洲国家的进步报纸——“工人呼声报”（巴西）、“人民报”（巴西）、“人民报”（乌拉圭）、“世纪报”
  （智利）及其他报纸都刊载了许多评论两大宣言的历史意义的文章。巴西“工人呼声报”的社论说，各国共产党和工人党会议证明了世界各国共产党和工人党之间的国际联系的进一步加强。社论指出，六十四个代表团所签署的和平宣言显示出共产主义运动的最伟大的成就，它号召各国人民为和平而斗争并对战争集团的阴谋提高警惕。社论强调指出，莫斯科会议和会上所通过的文件是国际共产主义运动生命力的光辉证明。
    乌拉圭“人民报”发表的文章写道，乌拉圭人民同一切善良的人们一道，一定会热烈欢迎共产党和工人党的号召，并为和平事业作出自己的贡献。
