Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 18th: After receiving the news broadcast by Xinhua News Agency on the 15th and published in the People's Daily regarding the progress of the nationwide farmland water conservancy construction movement, which criticized the slow progress of water conservancy construction in Yunnan, the First Secretary and other secretaries of the CPC Yunnan Provincial Committee, who were inspecting work in the countryside, exchanged opinions at a telephone conference yesterday. Last night, they convened a telephone conference attended by the secretaries of local committees. The Provincial Committee believes that the criticism is correct and requires all localities to immediately catch up with revolutionary spirit, and has given instructions on various specific measures.

The Secretariat of the Provincial Committee pointed out: Currently, 2.5 million people, accounting for 32% of the labor force in the province, are engaged in water conservancy construction, but the development is uneven across regions. The Provincial Committee requires that during winter production, the attendance rate of men, women, young, and old in rural areas should reach over 90%; among them, the labor force for water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation should account for over 80%. The Secretariat of the Provincial Committee also pointed out: In addition to the attendance rate, special attention should be paid to the daily working hours. All localities must reach the level of advanced regions, which is eight to ten hours of work per day. In order to ensure the rapid progress of the project, shifts should be organized to work day and night.

The Secretariat of the Provincial Committee believes that the key to completing the above-mentioned water conservancy construction tasks lies in improving work efficiency and strengthening political and ideological work in rural areas. The Provincial Committee requires leading personnel at all levels to "go to the front lines," summarize and exchange experiences, and extensively organize visits and competitions. Local committees, county committees, and township party committees should complete the tasks under contract, adhering to the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical. Except for individual areas where the season is later and can extend to mid-April, the remaining areas should complete 70% to 80% of the water conservancy plan tasks by the end of March.

    改变落后状态  迎头赶上先进
    中共云南省委指示各地拿出革命干劲兴修水利
    据新华社昆明18日电　此间收到新华社15日播发人民日报刊登的全国各地农田水利建设运动进展情况的消息，对云南兴修水利进展迟缓提出批评以后，正在农村检查工作的中共云南省委第一书记和其他书记昨天在电话会议上交换了意见，并在昨天夜间召开了各地委书记参加的电话会议，省委认为这个批评讲得对，要求各地以革命气概立即迎头赶上，并对各项具体措施作了指示。
    省委书记处指出：现在全省已有占劳动力32％的二百五十万人正在兴修水利，但各地发展不平衡。省委要求在冬季生产中，农村男女老少的出勤率应达到90％以上；其中水利和积肥两项的劳动力合计应在80％以上。省委书记处同时指出：除了出勤率以外，还需特别注意每天的劳动时间。各地必须达到先进地区每天劳动八小时到十小时的水平。为了保证工程迅速进行，还应该组织分班日夜赶工。
    省委书记处认为：完成上述水利建设任务的关键，在于提高工效和加强农村政治思想工作。省委要求各级领导人员必须“上前线”，总结交流经验，并广泛地组织参观和竞赛。各地委、县委和乡党委要本着多快好省的方针，包干完成。除个别季节较晚的地区可到4月中旬以外，其余各地都应在3月底完成水利计划任务的70％至80％。
