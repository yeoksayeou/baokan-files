    Sun Yuxi Goes to School
    I am Sun Jiuxing, the father of the young erhu player Sun Yuxi. I would like to report Sun Yuxi's recent situation to the comrades who care about him. Since the People's Daily supplement reported on Sun Yuxi's illness last year, comrades from all over the country have written to express their condolences and have given us great help in terms of material support. At the same time, Sun Yuxi has also received care in terms of treatment, and has received medical treatment at the Jilin Railway Central Hospital, the Liaoyuan Railway Health Center and other places. The doctors also took special care of Sun Yuxi. An old doctor in his sixties, surnamed Liu, even personally visited our home and provided guidance in medical treatment. Li, the president of Meihekou Railway Hospital, personally led Sun Yuxi to the Affiliated Hospital of Shenyang Medical University for a health check. With the care of all parties, Sun Yuxi has recovered his health. Now he has entered Liaoyuan Railway Primary School to study. The teachers love him very much, and the classmates are also very kind to him. He is working hard to study. Please rest assured, comrades!

    孙玉玺上学了
    我是小胡琴手孙玉玺的父亲，我愿意把孙玉玺最近的情况向关心他的同志们报告一下。自从去年人民日报副刊报道了孙玉玺患病的情况后，全国各地都有同志写信来慰问我们，并且在物质方面给了我们很大的帮助。同时孙玉玺在治疗方面也得到了照顾，先后在吉林铁路中心医院、辽源市铁路卫生所等处医治。医生对于孙玉玺也特别爱护，一位六十多岁的姓刘的老医生还亲自上我家来访问，在医疗方面给予指导。梅河口铁路医院李院长还亲自领着孙玉玺到沈阳医科大学附属医院去作健康检查。在各方面的关怀下，孙玉玺恢复健康了。现在他已进入辽源铁路小学读书，老师们很爱护他，同学们对他也很好，他正在努力地学习。请同志们放心吧！
