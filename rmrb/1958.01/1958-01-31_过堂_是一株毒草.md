    “Passing the Ordeal” is a Poisonous Weed
    Fang Cheng
    After the short play-like thing I wrote, "Passing the Ordeal," was published in the "People's Daily" supplement on May 30th last year, it quickly aroused extremely different reactions. Some people said it was good, some said it was bad. To be honest, I initially thought of it as a masterpiece, a fragrant flower. But now it seems, it is really a poisonous weed.
    Just when the right-wingers in literary and art circles were launching attacks against the Party's leadership in literary and art work, distorting the Party's leadership as being arrogant, ignorant, bureaucratic and dogmatic, this article also depicted painters and crosstalk performers as "common people" under the rule of "masters," putting on a miserable look of being wronged and unable to argue; just when the right-wingers were vehemently opposed to the proletarian dictatorship, negating the great achievements of the anti-Rightist movement, and slandering the personnel work of state organs, this article also, with a contemptuous tone, regarded the legitimate and serious work of reviewing cadres as an object of ridicule. In addition, there were many statements that were not wrong in themselves, such as "Criticism is of course possible, but attitudes must be examined first," "How can one be sharp and acrimonious towards one's own comrades," and the correct principles of criticism advocated by the Party, such as "curing the sickness to save the patient," which were all placed in the satirized "verdict," thus confusing the principles of right and wrong.
    This essay was written in early May. At that time, the supplement was unfolding a debate on short essays and satire. Some people believed that satire should not be used for self-criticism within the people. I opposed this opinion and wrote this essay to participate in the debate. But why is it poisonous? Where does the poison come from? This requires digging into the ideology.
    At that time, the right-wingers in the cartoon world were stirring up trouble, raising an evil wind, opposing the Party's leadership in the cartoon industry, and attacking and ridiculing the leading comrades of the newspaper editorial department. Just as unhealthy weather does not affect a healthy person, but can quickly cause a cold to an unhealthy person. Because I myself was harboring bourgeois individualistic dissatisfaction in this regard, it aroused resonance, lost my position, and reflected these reactionary ideas of the right-wingers in this essay.
    This is a painful lesson that makes me deeply feel that bourgeois ideology is like bacteria, not only eroding oneself, but also spreading to the outside, infecting others, and affecting society.
    The anti-Rightist struggle has given me a very good lesson. It has made me further realize this fundamental issue: literature and art serve politics, whether you realize it or not. If you do not serve this class, you serve that class. In the socialist revolution, if you do not become a revolutionary literary and art worker, you have the possibility of becoming a reactionary literary and art worker. To be a revolutionary literary and art worker, you need to thoroughly transform yourself and become a thorough proletarian literary and art fighter. If a little bourgeois bacteria is left uneliminated, it will multiply and grow in the body, and if you encounter any unhealthy weather again, it will cause your old illness to relapse and spread toxins outwards.

    “过堂”是一株毒草
    方成
    我写的“过堂”这篇短剧式的东西，去年5月30日在“人民日报”副刊上刊出以后，很快就引起了极端不同的反映。有人说好，有人说坏。老实说，当初我自己认为这是一篇得意之作，是一朵香花。但是现在看来，实在是一株毒草。
    正当文艺界的右派分子向党对文艺事业的领导发动攻击，把党的领导歪曲刻画成为蛮横无知的官僚主义、教条主义者的时候，这篇文章也把画家和相声艺人描写成为在“老爷”统治下的“小民”，故作含冤抱屈、有理难辩的苦相；正当右派分子极力反对无产阶级专政，否定肃反运动的伟大功绩，并污蔑国家机关的人事工作的时候，这篇文章也以轻蔑的口吻，把审查干部等正当而严肃的工作，当作嘲笑的对象。此外，还有许多本来并不错误的说法，例如“批评当然可以，态度先要检查”“对待自己同志，岂可尖酸泼辣”，以及党所倡导的“治病救人”等等正确的批评原则，都被放在被讽刺的“判词”里，这就混淆了是非的原则了。
    这篇杂文是5月初写的。那时副刊上正展开关于小品文和讽刺问题的争论。其中有人认为在人民内部进行自我批评，不应该使用讽刺的手段。我反对这个意见，就写出这篇杂文来参加辩论。可是，为什么会有毒呢？毒是从哪里来的？这就要从思想上去挖掘了。
    当时，漫画界的右派分子正在兴风作浪，鼓起了一股邪风，反对党对漫画事业的领导，并对报刊编辑部领导同志进行攻击和嘲笑。正如天时不正一样，对于一个健康的人不会有什么影响，而对不健康的人，就会很快引起伤风感冒。因为我自己在这方面正怀着资产阶级个人主义的不满情绪，于是引起了共鸣，丧失了立场，把这些右派的反动意识反映到这篇杂文里来。
    这是一次沉痛的教训，使我深切地感到资产阶级思想和细菌一样，不但在侵蚀自己，也同时向四外传播，感染别人，影响社会。
    反右派斗争给我上了很好的一课。它使我进一步认识到这个根本问题：文艺是为政治服务的，不论你意识到没有。你不为这个阶级服务，便是为那个阶级服务。在社会主义革命中，你不作革命的文艺工作者，就有变成反动的文艺工作者的可能。要作革命的文艺工作者，就需要彻底地改造自己，成为一个地地道道的无产阶级文艺战士。如果留下一点资产阶级细菌没有完全消除，它就会在机体内繁殖滋长，再遇到什么天时不正，还会使你旧病复发，向外传播毒素的。
