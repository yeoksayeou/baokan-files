Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: The people of all walks of life in the capital launched an unprecedented large-scale competition on January 15th to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene.

At the city-wide winter competition conference for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene held on the 15th, 928 factories, schools, government offices, troops, streets, townships, and towns proposed to meet the requirements of "four-without" in one week to one month. In addition, four districts have proposed to become "four-without" districts within six months to one year.

Participants in the competition included representatives from street offices, residents' committees, townships, towns, government offices, troops, factories, mines, construction sites, schools, shops, and handicraft production cooperatives, as well as hygiene models, hygiene activists, rat and sparrow catching experts, and representatives from individual areas and units with poor hygiene. Leading members of the Party, government, labor union, and youth league from the central government and Beijing also attended the conference. More than 7,000 people participated in the conference.

At the competition conference, challenges and responses followed one after another, with each condition higher than the last, and each deadline for achieving the "four-without" goal shorter than the last. The deputy district head of Qianmen District proposed that the entire district achieve "four-without" within one year. The deputy district head of Dongsi District, in response, proposed achieving "four-without" before National Day. The deputy district head of Xuanwu District further proposed achieving "four-without" within half a year. The measures proposed by Xuanwu District to achieve "four-without" are: launching six surprise rat extermination campaigns throughout the district, organizing voluntary labor to fill in 63 stagnant water pits, dredging 11 open ditches and rivers, improving all unsanitary toilets in the district, and eliminating all sparrow nests in the district's housing, while also ensuring that every family develops the habit of being clean and hygienic. Xisi District, which was considered to have formulated an advanced "four-without" plan a month ago, originally planned to achieve "four-without" in two years. Today, seeing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the first three districts, the representatives of this district did not take the stage to speak. They plan to return to the district to study and catch up immediately.

The government offices, troops, schools, factories, shops, streets, and towns that challenged and responded at the meeting also put forward methods to achieve the "four-without" goal in the shortest possible time in their pledges. The two non-staple food retail management offices of Xisi District and Xidan District guaranteed to clean up all maggots in the sauce vats of more than 2,000 retail stores under their jurisdiction by assigning responsibility for each area. The Ministry of Finance guaranteed that leaders would personally take action, conduct regular inspections, and conduct criticism and commendation at any time with big-character posters and blackboard newspapers. Some units in the Jingxi Mining Area guaranteed to achieve the "eight-without" goal within one month: no rats, no sparrows, no mosquitoes, no flies, no bedbugs, no fleas, no cockroaches, and no stove ants. The units that challenged and responded at the meeting all proposed that everyone conduct supervision and go to check at that time.

The capital's movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene began in early December of last year. In late December, surprise weeks were held in the urban and suburban areas, with 150,000 people participating in publicity activities and 10,000 people participating in large-scale inspections in the urban and suburban areas. The movement included praise and criticism, was swift and decisive, and had a grand momentum. 90% of households in the urban area carried out a general cleaning, and 99% of households achieved no flies and no mosquitoes. Most of the 120,000 households inspected in the suburbs also had no mosquitoes and no flies, and the environment was clean. The urban area also implemented classified collection of garbage and dissuaded spitting anywhere; some suburban areas also carried out large-scale mud sealing composting and turning toilets and digging pupae. Since January, the movement has shifted to focusing on catching and killing rats and sparrows. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1.06 million rats and sparrows have been caught and killed so far. Areas with nearly one million people have proposed to completely eliminate the four pests in winter and achieve four-without. The city's hygiene movement is rising wave upon wave, and today's competition conference has pushed the movement to a new climax.

At today's competition conference, five units reported their actual achievements in achieving "four-without" to the people of the capital. The representatives of these units also announced at the meeting that, according to their experience, as long as conservative thinking is broken, leadership is strengthened, and the masses are mobilized, eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene can also be achieved in the shortest time by adopting the leap forward method.

The first to report good news was the representative of the Fusui Jing Street Office. In the more than 40 hutongs under the jurisdiction of this office, after identification and certification, dirty water, fruit peels, paper scraps, and cinders cannot be found anywhere. The more than 4,500 households in the area are all bright and clean, not only the beds and tables are very clean, but also the furniture used for cooking, and the brooms and dustpans for cleaning garbage are arranged in an orderly manner. Most of the residents living here are tricycle workers, vendors, and handicraft households. They clean every morning and evening and regularly take turns to check and compare. The situation of the two street offices of Nan Chang Street and Hongqiao, which also reported good news at the meeting, is similar to that of the Fusui Jing Street Office.

Following that, the Mishi Hutong Primary School and the Ministry of Communications reported good news. Now every primary school student in Mishi Hutong Primary School can explain the principles of "eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene." The students not only develop personal hygiene habits such as not spitting anywhere and keeping their fingernails clean, but also clean the school buildings every day and do a good job in public health. Under the personal leadership of the responsible person of the Party Committee, the Ministry of Communications mobilized the masses to earnestly implement every arrangement made by the Municipal and District People's Committees for the patriotic hygiene movement and persisted in the system of conducting a general cleaning once a month. Now the offices, corridors, dining rooms, and kitchens of this ministry are often clean and tidy.

The advanced deeds of these units that reported good news further encouraged the people present. Representatives of some backward units are prepared to take immediate action after returning to reverse the current backward state.

Chen Peng, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, Wang Kunlun, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and others spoke at today's conference. Chen Peng hoped that everyone would take all measures to continue on the basis of the surprise movement, and that Party organizations and administrative leaders at all levels would strengthen the leadership of this movement, and that all Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members would become active participants in the patriotic hygiene movement. Wang Kunlun encouraged everyone to help each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, move forward courageously, complete the competition conditions on schedule, and turn the capital into a four-without city with a brand-new sanitary appearance and eliminate the four pests forever as soon as possible.

    一浪高过一浪，把运动推向新的高潮
    首都掀起除四害大竞赛
    五个单位先报捷，九百多个单位决心在最短期间做到“四无”
    新华社15日讯  首都各行各业的人民15日掀起了一个规模空前的除四害、讲卫生的大竞赛。
    在15日举行的全市冬季除四害、讲卫生的竞赛大会上，有九百二十八个工厂、学校、机关、部队、街道和乡、镇提出了在一个星期到一个月的时间里，分别达到“四无”的要求。另外还有四个区也都提出在半年到一年的时间内成为“四无”区。
    参加竞赛大会的，有街道办事处、居民委员会、乡、镇及机关、部队、厂矿、工地、学校、商店和手工业生产合作社的代表，还有卫生模范、卫生积极分子、捕鼠、捕雀能手，以及个别卫生落后的地区和单位的代表。中央和北京市的党、政、工、团的负责人也参加了大会。参加大会的共有七千多人。
    在竞赛大会上，挑战和应战的一个接着一个，一个比一个的条件高，一个比一个达到“四无”目的的期限短。前门区副区长提出全区在一年内做到“四无”，东四区副区长应战时提出在国庆节前做到“四无”，宣武区副区长更提出在半年内达到“四无”。宣武区提出的做到“四无”的措施是：在全区范围内发动六次突击灭鼠运动，组织义务劳动填平六十三处积水坑洼，疏通十一处明沟河道，改善区内一切不合卫生要求的厕所，把全区住房的雀窝掏尽堵绝，同时还要做到每一个家庭都养成爱清洁讲卫生的习惯。一个月前，被人们认为订出了先进“四无”规划的西四区，原来准备在两年内做到“四无”，今天这个区的代表看到了前三个区的革命劲头，就没有上台发言，他们准备回区研究后立即赶上去。
    在会上挑战应战的机关、部队、学校、工厂、商店、街道、城镇在战书中也都提出了以最短的时间达到“四无”目标的办法。西四区、西单区两个副食品零售管理处保证对所属二千多个零售商店的酱缸，采用分片负责的办法，清除掉所有的蛆虫。财政部保证领导亲自动手，定期检查，并以大字报、黑板报随时进行批评表扬。京西矿区有些单位保证在一个月内，达到“八无”的目标：无鼠、无雀、无蚊、无蝇、无臭虫、无跳蚤、无蟑螂、无灶蚂。在会上挑战应战的单位都提出希望大家进行监督，到时候前往检查。
    首都的除四害讲卫生运动，是从去年12月初开始的。12月下旬又在城、郊分别举行了突击周，有十五万人参加了宣传活动，一万人参加了城郊大检查。运动中有表扬，有批评，雷厉风行，声势浩大。城区90％住户进行了大扫除，有99％的住户做到无蝇无蚊。郊区经过检查的十二万户中，大多数也无蚊无蝇，环境清洁。在城区还实行了垃圾分类收集，劝止随地吐痰；有些郊区还进行了大型泥封堆肥和翻厕所、挖蛹。从1月份以来，运动转入集中力量捕打老鼠、麻雀，据不完全统计，到目前为止已经捕打鼠、雀一百零六万多只。有近一百万人口的地区提出了要在冬季彻底清除四害，做到四无。全市的卫生运动一浪高过一浪，今天这个竞赛大会，又把运动推向新的高潮。
    在今天举行的竞赛大会上，有五个单位用已经做到“四无”的实际成绩，向首都人民报捷。这些单位的代表们并在会上宣布，根据他们的经验，只要打破保守思想，加强领导，发动群众，除四害讲卫生也完全可以采用跃进的方法在最短时间内实现。
    首先报捷的是福绥境街道办事处的代表。在这个办事处所管的四十多条胡同里，经过鉴定证明，现在到处都已找不到脏水、果皮、纸屑、煤渣。管界内的四千五百多户人家，家家窗明几净，不仅床、桌上很干净，而且做饭用的家具，清扫垃圾的扫帚、畚箕也都摆得井井有条。住在这里的居民多数是三轮车工人、摊贩、手工业户，他们每天早晚都进行清扫，经常轮流进行检查评比。在会上报捷的南长街、红桥两个街道办事处的情况也和福绥境街道办事处的相仿。
    接着报捷的有米市胡同小学和交通部。现在米市胡同小学的每个小学生，都能讲“除四害、讲卫生”的道理。学生们不但养成了不随地吐痰、保持手指甲清洁等个人卫生习惯，还每天打扫校舍，作好公共卫生工作。交通部在党委负责人亲自领导下，发动群众认真执行了市、区人民委员会对爱国卫生运动所作的每项布置，坚持了每个月进行一次大扫除的制度。现在这个部的办公室、走廊、饭厅、厨房经常整洁。
    这些报捷单位的先进事迹更加鼓舞了到会的人，一些落后单位的代表准备回去后立即行动起来，扭转目前的落后状态。
    中共北京市委书记处书记陈鹏、北京市副市长王昆仑等在今天的大会上讲了话。陈鹏希望大家在突击运动的基础上采取一切措施持续下去，各级党组织和行政负责人都来加强对这个运动的领导，一切共产党员、共青团员都要成为爱国卫生运动的积极分子。王昆仑勉励大家互相帮助，取长补短，勇敢前进，按期完成竞赛条件，尽早把首都变成一个卫生面貌崭新，永远消除四害的四无城。
