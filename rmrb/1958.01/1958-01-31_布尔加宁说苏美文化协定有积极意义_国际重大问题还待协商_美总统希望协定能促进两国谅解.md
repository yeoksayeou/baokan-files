Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch. TASS, Moscow, 29th dispatch: A "News" reporter asked the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin: "How do you evaluate the negotiations on developing various ties between the Soviet Union and the United States, which just ended in Washington?"

Bulganin gave the following reply:

Undoubtedly, the cultural, technological, and educational agreement signed between the Soviet Union and the United States has positive significance. The agreement stipulates the mutual dispatch of delegations in industry, agriculture, and science, and specifies a series of steps in cultural exchange. Obviously, the implementation of the measures stipulated in the agreement will help the people of the Soviet Union and the United States to better understand each other and will enhance mutual understanding and trust between the two countries. It should be expected that this agreement will become an important step in establishing friendly ties between the people of the two countries.

We believe that reaching an agreement on cultural exchange is of great significance, but at the same time, we cannot forget those major international political issues that remain unresolved, and for which the necessary mutual understanding has not yet been achieved between countries in resolving these issues. Therefore, I would like to emphasize that we believe that joint consultation on mature international problems would be of great significance.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch, Washington news: US President Eisenhower issued a statement on the 27th expressing satisfaction with the newly signed Soviet-American cultural, technological, and educational exchange agreement. Eisenhower said that he hoped the agreement would be implemented in the same spirit that inspired both parties to negotiate. He firmly believed that through this agreement, the people of the Soviet Union and the United States would be able to achieve better understanding.

Democratic Senate Leader Johnson said that although this agreement "does not solve the problems of this war-weary world, it is an important first step—the beginning of the beginning. Therefore, this is one of the most important events in many years."

Johnson said that he and some other senators believe that it is currently necessary to establish a "new relationship" in the world so that the United States and the Soviet Union, living in the same world, will not "resort to arms."

However, Johnson also emphasized that all members of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee, of which he is chairman, believe that the United States still "urgently needs" to "accelerate the pace" in expanding its military.

Many American newspapers also welcomed the Soviet-American cultural, technological, and educational exchange agreement, believing that this agreement is a major step forward on the road to ending the "Cold War."

    布尔加宁说苏美文化协定有积极意义
    国际重大问题还待协商
    美总统希望协定能促进两国谅解
    新华社30日讯　塔斯社莫斯科29日讯：“消息报”记者问苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁：“您如何评价刚在华盛顿结束的关于发展苏美两国之间各种联系的谈判？”
    布尔加宁作了如下的答复：
    毫无疑问，苏联和美国签订的文化、技术和教育协定具有积极的意义。协定中规定互派工业、农业、科学代表团，并且规定了文化交流方面的一系列的步骤。显然，实现协定所规定的措施有助于苏美两国人民更好地相互了解，会增强苏美两国之间的相互谅解和信任。应该期望，这项协定会成为建立两国人民之间友好联系的一个重要步骤。
    我们认为在文化交流方面达成协议具有重要的意义，同时也不能忘记那些重大的国际政治问题，因为这些问题仍然没有得到解决，而且各国之间在解决这些问题方面仍然没有取得必要的相互谅解。因此，我想强调指出，我们认为两国在解决已经成熟的国际问题方面的协商行动具有巨大意义。
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔27日发表声明，对刚刚签订的苏美文化、技术和教育交流协定表示满意。艾森豪威尔说，他希望这个协定将能以鼓舞双方谈判的同样精神予以执行。他深信通过这个协定，苏美两国人民将能够获致更好的谅解。
    民主党参议院领袖约翰逊说，虽然这个协定“解决不了这个厌战的世界的问题，但是它却是重要的第一步——开端的开端。因此，这是许多年来最重要的事件之一。”
    约翰逊说，他和其他一些参议员认为，目前有必要在世界上建立一个“新的关系”，使生活在同一个世界里的美苏两国不致于“诉诸武器”。
    但是约翰逊同时强调，他担任主席的参议院军备小组委员会的全部委员都认为，美国现在仍然“迫切需要”在扩充军备方面“加速步调”。
    美国许多报纸也欢迎苏美文化、技术和教育交流协定，认为这个协定是在终止“冷战”的道路上迈进一大步。
