Xi'an Textile Factory Leaders and Cadres
    Participate in Labor at Fixed Posts
    Strengthening Ties with the Masses; Physical Labor Achieves Regularization

    (Our Report) According to the Xi'an Daily News: The leading cadres of the Xi'an Textile Factory have adopted a method of assigning each leader to a fixed workshop or process when participating in physical labor. This has reversed the previous phenomenon of gathering together, which prevented them from working together with the masses and closely connecting with them. This has been welcomed by the masses and has put the participation in physical labor on the right track.
    Since mid-May of last year, the Xi'an Textile Factory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized 26 leaders and cadres above the level of section chief and workshop director to participate in physical labor. At that time, many people one-sidedly believed that the participation of leading cadres in physical labor was only to temper their labor viewpoint, change the masses' incorrect view of physical labor, and understand the masses' opinions and requirements for the work of the leaders. Others simply started from an economic point of view, thinking that the participation of leading cadres in labor could save some temporary workers. Therefore, every scheduled labor day, everyone would organize to clean up the environment, dredge ditches, and pile bricks and tiles. A few times, they had also gone to the workshop to work, talking with workers while working to understand their opinions and requirements. However, the workers reflected: "Many cadres come, say a lot of things, which affects work." During this rectification, the Party committee studied this issue based on the opinions of the masses and decided: 1. Leading cadres of each workshop participate in labor in their own workshop; 2. Factory-level leading cadres participate in labor in the workshop they originally supervised; 3. They participate in the labor related to the work they are in charge of (such as the deputy factory director in charge of living conditions participates in labor in the cafeteria); 4. They participate in the labor of the process they know how to operate; 5. Those who do not have the skill can choose a process to learn the skill.
    From the recent weeks' situation, this practice has been very well received by the masses. Many workers believe that leading cadres eating and working with them has truly changed the work style. Party Secretary Fan Zhixin learned to add shuttles in the weaving workshop, and the workers patiently taught him. He mastered the operation in only half a day. Zhu Lianfang, the head of the mechanical section, and others participated in opening boxes and moving machines. With the help of the workers, they learned some production knowledge and skills. Workers are also willing to reflect their opinions and requirements to the leaders. According to recent statistics, during the labor of leading cadres, the masses reflected 19 relatively important opinions, and many problems have been solved in a timely manner.
    Leading cadres' participation in labor in the workshop has become a habit. Every Thursday, after eating breakfast, they go to work in the workshop and go to work and get off work with the workers. The number of people participating in labor is also increasing, from 26 in the past to 40 now. Full-time cadres of the Party committee, the Youth League committee, and the trade union also take half a day each week to participate in labor in the workshop.

### 西安纺织厂领导干部  固定岗位参加劳动  密切了同群众的联系　体力劳动作到了正规化

    西安纺织厂领导干部
    固定岗位参加劳动
    密切了同群众的联系　体力劳动作到了正规化
    本报讯　据西安日报报道：西安纺织厂领导干部参加体力劳动，采取了每个领导干部在参加劳动时固定在各个车间或工序的办法，扭转了过去聚集一起，不能与群众共同劳动、紧密结合的现象，受到了群众的欢迎，也使参加体力劳动走上正轨。
    中共西安纺织厂委员会从去年五月中旬就组织了科长、车间主任以上领导干部二十六人参加体力劳动。当时不少人片面地认为领导干部参加体力劳动，只是为了锻炼领导干部的劳动观点，扭转群众对体力劳动的不正确的看法，并且了解群众对领导工作的意见和要求；也有人单纯从经济观点出发，认为领导干部参加劳动，可以节省些临时工。因此，每到规定的劳动日，大家就组织起来，打扫环境卫生，疏通水沟，堆砖拉瓦；也有几次曾经到车间工作，一面干活一边和工人谈话，了解工人的意见和要求。但是工人们反映：“干部来得多，说很多话，影响了工作”。这次整改中，党委根据群众意见研究了这个问题，决定：一、各车间领导干部在本车间参加劳动；二、厂级领导干部原来分管那个车间就在那个车间参加劳动；三、自己管什么工作，参加什么劳动（如管生活的副厂长就在食堂劳动）；四、会那个工序操作就参加那个工序劳动；五、没有技术的可以选择工序学习技术。
    从最近几个星期的情况看，这种作法很受群众欢迎。许多职工认为，领导干部和工人同吃同干，真正改变了工作作风。党委书记樊执信在织造车间学习加梭，工人耐心教他，仅半天的时间就掌握了操作；机械科科长朱莲芳等参加开箱子、搬机器，在职工群众的帮助下，学到了一些生产知识和技术。工人们有意见和要求也愿意向领导人员反映。据最近统计，在领导干部劳动期间，群众反映的意见比较重要的就有十九条，不少问题已经及时解决。
    领导干部在车间参加劳动已经成为习惯。每到星期四，他们吃过早饭以后，就到车间上工，和工人一起上班下班。参加劳动的人数也越来越多，已经由过去的二十六人增加到四十人。党委、团委、工会的专职干部也每周抽出半天的时间到车间参加劳动。
