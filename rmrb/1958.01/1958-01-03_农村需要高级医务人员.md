    The Countryside Needs Senior Medical Personnel
    The vast majority of medical personnel working in cities have not participated in labor. Labor training is also urgently needed for them, especially for a large number of senior medical personnel. We urgently hope that they will go to the countryside to receive training. Although they are not familiar enough with rural life, we guarantee to help them overcome difficulties in labor, life, and other aspects as much as possible.
    We believe that medical personnel who come to the countryside do not necessarily have to participate directly in labor production. Some can go to the most basic medical and preventative units in the countryside to work. In this way, on the one hand, they can become familiar with the lives of farmers by eating, living, and working with rural medical personnel, and establish deep class feelings with farmers. On the other hand, they can directly serve the countryside.
    From the perspective of our Qichun County, although nine schistosomiasis prevention and treatment stations and groups have been established, only one of the twenty-four doctors is a physician, and the remaining twenty-three are medical assistants. Therefore, we believe that sending senior medical personnel to the countryside to supplement the most basic medical and preventative units is of extremely great significance.

    农村需要高级医务人员
    在城市工作的医务人员，绝大多数是没有参加过劳动的。劳动锻炼对他们来说也是迫切需要的，特别是很大一批高级医务人员，我们迫切希望他们下到农村来得到锻炼。虽然他们对农村生活是不够熟悉的，但是我们保证在尽可能的条件下帮助他们克服在劳动上、生活上和其他各方面的困难。
    我们认为医务人员到农村来，并不一定都直接参加劳动生产，有些人可以到农村最基层的医疗预防单位去工作。这样一方面可以使他们通过同农村的医务人员同吃同住同工作，熟悉农民生活，并和农民建立深厚的阶级感情。另一方面，可以使他们直接为农村服务。
    从我们蕲春县来看，虽然已经建立了九个血吸虫病防治站、组，但是二十四个医生中只有一个是医师，其余二十三个都是医士。因此，我们认为下放高级医务人员到农村去，充实最基层的医疗预防单位，是有极重大意义的。
