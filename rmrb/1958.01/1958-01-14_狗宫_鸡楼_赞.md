    In Praise of "Dog Palaces" and "Chicken Mansions"
          Lin Hai
	"Dog Palaces" and "Chicken Mansions" are truly extravagant,
	Brick and wood structure with cement floors,
	Living here is truly pleasant:
	Playing happily and sleeping peacefully.
	Don't worry when you're hungry,
	The kitchen has delicious food prepared for you.
	Basins and showers for you to wash in,
	Someone to care for you when you're sick.
	Looking out through the doors and windows:
	A beautiful landscape,
	Catches the eye!
	Oh, oh, dogs and chickens, you truly have good fortune, ah, good fortune!
	When drinking water, don't forget the well-digger,
	When enjoying blessings, don't forget the designer,
	He doesn't care about the people's blood and sweat,
	Concentrating on seeking welfare for you.
	Where can you find such a benefactor?
	Difficult to find even one in a thousand!

    “狗宫”“鸡楼”赞
          林孩“狗宫”“鸡楼”真阔气，砖木结构水泥地，住在这里真惬意：玩得畅快睡得安逸。肚子饿了莫着急，厨房里为你准备有好吃的。盆池、淋浴随你洗，生病有人来护理。透过门窗望出去：一片好风光，映进眼帘里！哎哎呀，狗呀鸡呀你们真是好福气呀好福气！饮水莫忘开井人，享福莫忘设计师，人民的血汗他不管，专心为你们谋福利。这样的恩人那里有？千中难得挑出一！
