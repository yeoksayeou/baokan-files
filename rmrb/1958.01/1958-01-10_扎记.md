	Jottings
	A Sharp Satire
	Norwegian Minister of Defense, Hauge, said: "We should not miss any opportunity to start disarmament negotiations." He pointed out that the decision to establish medium-range rocket launch bases in Western Europe should be canceled because it is a "provocative measure against the other side." Then, he declared on behalf of the Norwegian government: "Norway has no plans to establish nuclear weapons depots on its territory."
	This wise attitude taken by the Norwegian government is a sharp satire on the heads of government of major Western European powers such as Macmillan, Gaillard, and Adenauer. Norway is not a major power, but proceeding from its own national interests, it dares to express dissent from the harmful decisions forced through by the United States at the NATO Paris meeting. However, Macmillan is willing to hand over British sovereignty and security in order to gain the support of the United States, acting as a "model partner" in providing missile bases for the United States; the Gaillard government is conducting the same transaction for more than 200 million US dollars; as for Adenauer, who occasionally acted as a "European spokesman" at the Paris meeting, immediately changed his tune and explained after being scolded by Washington.
	Can Missiles Save Lives?
	The US Congress discussed Eisenhower's request for increased military spending on the 8th. Members of both parties desperately advocated for arms expansion and war preparations. Senate Democratic leader Johnson said that "producing a thousand missiles in 1958 may save our lives." United Press International described the mood in the US Congress as: "As long as there are more missiles, the future will be bright."
	The cry of missiles saving lives from American congressmen shows that the "life" of American imperialism is indeed very dangerous. However, no matter how many missiles there are, they cannot save "life," but can only cause destruction. The US ruling clique wants to seek a future by creating destruction, and this future will certainly not be bright.
	Who Seizes Whom?
	Dutch Prime Minister Willem Drees shouted on January 7 that the Indonesian government's takeover of Dutch enterprises was a "seizure," and he demanded "compensation."
	But who is seizing whom? Recently, Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Zijlstra, admitted that Dutch capital plunders one billion guilders in profits from Indonesia every year. This figure accounts for about 20% of the Netherlands' total investment in Indonesia. Mr. Willem Drees and his ministers should first calculate how much the Netherlands has seized from Indonesia for more than 300 years, and then talk about compensation!
	A Thief's "Friendship"
	Last spring, when US Vice President Nixon visited Sudan, he sang praises of America's "friendship" with Sudan. But what exactly is Nixon's "friendship"? Recently, the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera" revealed some truth.
	It turned out that after Nixon returned to the United States from Africa, he made many secret suggestions to Eisenhower, one of which was aimed at Sudan. Nixon said that in his opinion, the Sudanese parliamentary elections to be held in February this year are very important because they will determine Sudan's foreign policy. Therefore, Nixon advocated that the United States must intervene, and he believed that "the United States has the potential to influence the outcome of this election."
	Nixon is like a skilled thief. This kind of thief visits people's homes during the day to find out the details so that he can steal at night. People should be wary of this kind of thief's "friendship"!

    辛辣的讽刺
    挪威国防大臣汉德尔说：“我们不应当错过任何一个可以开始裁军谈判的机会。”他指出，在西欧建立中程火箭发射基地的决定应该取消，因为这是一种“对另一方起挑衅作用的措施”。接着，他代表挪威政府声明：“挪威没有任何要在本国领土上建立原子武器仓库的计划”。
    挪威政府所采取的这种明智的态度，对麦克米伦、盖伊阿、阿登纳这些西欧大国政府的首脑是一个辛辣的讽刺。挪威并不是一个大国，从本国民族利益出发，却敢于对美国强使北大西洋集团巴黎会议通过的有害决定表示异议。但是，麦克米伦为了得到美国的提携而不惜交出英国的主权和安全，在为美国提供导弹基地问题上充当“模范伙伴”；盖伊阿政府正在为了二亿多块美金，进行着同样的交易；至于阿登纳，在巴黎会议上偶一充当“欧洲的发言人”，被华盛顿一喝，就赶紧改口解释。
    导弹能够救命吗？
    美国国会8日讨论艾森豪威尔增拨军费的要求，两党的议员们都拼命鼓吹扩军备战。参议院民主党领袖约翰逊说，在1958年中“生产一千颗导弹可能救我们的命”。合众社描写美国国会的心情是：“只要导弹多，前途就光明”。
    美国议员喊出了导弹救命的呼声，这说明美国帝国主义的“命”的的确确是很危险的了。但是，导弹无论多么多都是不能救“命”的，而只能造成毁灭。美国统治集团想以制造毁灭来寻求前途，这种前途肯定不会是光明的。
    谁夺取谁
    荷兰首相威廉·德里斯在1月7日大喊大叫说，印度尼西亚政府对荷兰企业的接管是“夺取”，他要求给予“赔偿”。
    可是，究竟是谁夺取谁呢？最近荷兰经济大臣赛尔斯特拉就承认，荷兰资本每年从印度尼西亚掠夺十亿荷盾的利润。这个数字约占荷兰在印度尼西亚总投资的20％。威廉·德里斯先生同他的大臣们应该首先计算一下，三百多年来荷兰从印度尼西亚夺取了多少东西，然后再来谈赔偿问题吧！
    小偷的“友谊”
    去年春天，美国副总统尼克松访问苏丹时，曾高唱美国对苏丹的“友谊”。可是尼克松的“友谊”到底是什么呢？最近意大利“国家晚报”透露了一些真相。
    原来尼克松从非洲回国以后就向艾森豪威尔提出许多秘密建议，其中有一条就是针对苏丹的。尼克松说，在他看来，将于今年2月举行的苏丹议会选举，是很重要的，因为它会决定苏丹的外交政策。于是，尼克松主张美国一定要进行干涉，他认为“美国有可能对这次选举的结果产生影响”。
    尼克松真像一个熟练的小偷。这种小偷白天到人家里去作客，目的在摸清底细，好在夜里去偷盗。对于这种小偷的“友谊”，人们应该警惕啊！
