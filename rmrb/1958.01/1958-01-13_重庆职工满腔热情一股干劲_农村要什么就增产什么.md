    Chongqing Workers with Full Enthusiasm and a Surge of Energy:
    Produce Whatever the Rural Areas Need
    (Our Dispatch) Chongqing's factories and enterprises are actively supporting the rural areas in realizing the Forty Articles on Agricultural Development. The local industrial departments have already arranged the 1958 production plan according to the new situation of the high tide of agricultural production and the orders from various parts of the province.
    In order to supply rural water conservancy construction equipment, the machinery industry department decided to trial-produce and produce thirty-six new products this year, including 3,000-horsepower gas engines, boiler engines and power water pumps, and 15,000-kilowatt generators. In addition to increasing the production of granular fertilizers, 666 powder, DDT and other chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the chemical industry department will also trial-produce and produce new products such as superphosphate and ammonium chloride. In order to increase fertilizer production, a lime nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 10,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer will be newly built this year; the fertilizer produced by this plant will all be used in rice fields, which can increase rice production by 67.5 million catties per year.
    The pharmaceutical industry department will mass-produce medicines for preventing and treating diseases such as trachoma and dysentery, as well as medicines for swine, cattle, and chicken plagues, as well as medicines for contraception and pest control. Daily necessities suitable for rural use will also be greatly increased, with thermos bottles increasing by 35.13% compared to last year, and rubber shoes increasing by 82%.
    Currently, farmers in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces are undertaking large-scale water conservancy projects and urgently need a batch of steel drills and sledgehammers for opening mountains and quarrying rocks. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has selected 43 tons of hard square steel and round steel from its inventory to supply to the rural areas. (Ding Fan)

    农村要什么就增产什么
    本报讯　重庆市各工厂企业积极支援农村实现农业发展四十条纲要。地方工业部门已经根据农业生产高潮的新形势和省内各地订货的要求，安排了1958年的生产计划。
    机械工业部门为了供应农村水利建设设备，决定在今年试制和生产三十六种新产品，其中包括三千马力的煤气机、锅驼机和动力水泵，一万五千瓩的发电机。化学工业部门除了要增产颗粒肥料、六六六粉、滴滴涕等化学肥料和农药以外，还要试制和生产过磷酸钙、氯化铵等新产品。为了增产肥料，今年将新建一座年产一万吨氮肥的石灰氮肥厂；这个厂出产的肥料全部用在稻田里，每年可以增产稻谷六千七百五十万斤。
    医药工业部门将大量生产防治砂眼、赤痢等疾病和猪、牛、鸡瘟的药品，以及节育避孕、除四害用的药品。适合农村使用的日用品也将大量增产，热水瓶将比去年增加35.13％，胶鞋将增加82％。
    现在四川、贵州两省农民正在大兴水利，急需一批开山凿石用的钢钎和鎯头。重庆钢铁公司已经在库存中选出四十三吨坚硬的方钢和元钢供给农村。　（丁帆）
