Combining Rectification of Communes to Comprehensively Improve Grain Conservation Work
　　Hunan Province to Inspect Planned Grain Usage Before Spring Festival
　　Changsha, January 26 (Report from this newspaper) - The CCP Hunan Provincial Committee, at a telephone conference of local (city) Party secretaries on January 24, instructed all localities to combine the rectification of agricultural cooperatives with an education campaign focused on diligence and frugality, mainly emphasizing grain conservation, before the Spring Festival. They are to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the implementation of grain conservation and planned grain usage, and further comprehensively improve grain work.

　　Since the autumn harvest last year, Hunan Province's grain conservation work, after grain debates and education on grain conservation and planned grain usage, has achieved great success. In many places, grain conservation and planned grain usage have become common practice, and systems have been established. More than 45,000 agricultural cooperatives in the province (accounting for over 90% of the total number of cooperatives in the province) have formulated grain conservation plans, and 80% to 90% of farmers can use grain according to the plan. Many model examples of grain conservation and planned grain usage have emerged in various places. After adhering to planned grain usage, 94% of the farmers in Guizhuping Agricultural Cooperative in Changde County had surplus grain. The main experience of this cooperative is to deeply educate farmers, especially women, on grain conservation. In order to adhere to planned grain usage, party members and cooperative cadres set an example; commended households that saved grain, appropriately criticized wasteful households, and carefully checked the grain usage of each household. They provided timely guidance to households with deficits to make up for the deficit. Shen Guixiang, a farmer from Donghua Cooperative in Xiangxiang County, saved 215 jin of rice from the autumn harvest to the end of November for his family of six by implementing methods such as measuring rice before cooking according to plan, combining staple and miscellaneous grains, eating two meals during slack months and three meals during busy months, eating dry rice with porridge, increasing the rice yield, and not using staple grains to feed livestock. By December, the county had saved 550,000 jin of grain, and winter production was going very well, with the number of workers often reaching more than 60% of the total. According to a survey by the provincial grain department, farmers across the province currently have more grain in storage than in the same period last year.

　　The Provincial Party Committee believes that it is of great significance that thousands of farmers can live their lives in a socialist way on the grain issue. Because this problem has been resolved well, it has not only created favorable conditions for this year's great leap forward in agricultural production, but also laid a foundation for doing a good job in grain work in the future.

　　The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that although the province's overall grain conservation achievements are great, the entire work is not without problems. According to a recent survey by the grain department, although more than 80% of farmers in the province are saving well, nearly 20% of households still have overspending and deficits due to various reasons. Among them, 5% to 10% of households are still wasteful. If the problems of these people are not resolved, it will inevitably affect spring plowing production. In order to solve the problems of these deficit households, the Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to combine the rectification of agricultural cooperatives before the Spring Festival, conduct a concentrated education campaign focused on diligence and frugality, mainly emphasizing grain conservation, universally inspect the implementation of grain conservation and planned grain usage, and convene a model representative meeting on grain conservation and planned grain usage to further establish a good atmosphere of diligence and frugality. For the problem of deficit households, in addition to those that can be solved by saving in the future, those with excessive grain shortages need to be discussed by the masses according to different situations, and help should be provided from the existing flexible grain, surplus grain, or reserve grain of the agricultural cooperative. Among them, wasteful households must be strictly managed by the agricultural cooperative to eliminate waste.

    结合整社全面作好节约粮食工作
    湖南省将在春节前检查计划用粮情况
    本报长沙26日电　中共湖南省委在1月24日召开各地（市）委书记电话会议上，指示各地在春节前，结合农业社的整改，进行一次以节约用粮为主要内容的勤俭持家的教育，普遍检查一次节约用粮和计划用粮的执行情况，进一步全面作好粮食工作。
    去年秋收以来，湖南省的粮食节约工作，经过粮食辩论和节约用粮、计划用粮的教育以后，已经取得很大成绩。许多地方节约用粮和计划用粮形成了风气，订出了制度。全省有四万五千多个农业社（占全省总社数的90％以上）都订了节约用粮计划，其中80％至90％的农户都能按计划用粮。各地都出现了许多节约用粮、计划用粮的模范事例。常德县贵竹坪农业社在坚持计划用粮以后，全社有94％的农户口粮有节余。这个社的主要经验是，深入教育农民，特别是妇女节约用粮。为了把计划用粮坚持下来，党员和社干部作出了榜样；表扬用粮节约户，适当地批评了浪费户，同时认真地检查每户的用粮情况。对亏空户作到及时指导弥补亏空。湘乡县东华社农民沈桂祥由于实行按计划量米下锅、主杂粮搭配、闲月吃两顿、忙月吃三顿、干饭搭稀饭、提高出饭率、不用主粮喂牲畜等办法，全家六口人，从秋收到11月底，节余大米二百十五斤。这个县到12月份已节余粮食五十五万斤，而冬季生产搞的很好，出工人数经常达到占总人数的60％以上。据省粮食部门调查，目前全省农民存粮比去年同期为多。
    省委认为：在粮食问题上，千家万户的农民能够这样按社会主义方式过生活，的确是具有重大的意义。由于这个问题解决得好，不仅为今年的农业生产大跃进创造了有利条件，而且为今后做好粮食工作打下了基础。
    省委指出：虽然全省在节约用粮的总的方面成绩是大的，但整个工作也不是完全没有问题。据粮食部门最近调查：全省80％以上的农户虽然节约得好，也还有近20％的户因种种原因用粮超支和亏空。其中5％—10％的户还有浪费。这些人的问题解决不好，必然会影响春耕生产。为了解决这部分亏空户的问题，省委要求各地在春节前结合农业社的整改，集中地进行一次以节约用粮为主要内容的勤俭持家的教育，普遍检查一次节约用粮、计划用粮的执行情况，并召开一次节约用粮和计划用粮的模范代表会，进一步树立勤俭持家的风气。对于亏空户的问题，除了今后实行节约可以自己解决的以外，对于缺粮过多的需要分别不同情况，通过群众讨论，从农业社现有的机动粮、超产粮，或储备粮中给以帮助解决。其中对浪费户必须由农业社严加管理，杜绝浪费。
