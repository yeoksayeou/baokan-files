　　Notes

　　“Basic Strategy”

　　According to the Associated Press, the Washington government has determined a "basic strategy" for the issue of East-West summit talks, which is: to insist that "Russia should first demonstrate its sincerity with new disarmament concessions," otherwise Eisenhower and Dulles "will do their utmost to oppose any new summit conference."

　　Why is this the case? The Associated Press report said that this is because Eisenhower and Dulles increasingly believe that holding such talks is inevitable, but they have "no confidence whatsoever" in the future of such negotiations.

　　Obviously, insisting that the Soviet Union make concessions is not to strengthen Eisenhower and Dulles' "confidence," but to enable them to "do their utmost to oppose" this inevitable conference.

　　So-called "basic strategy," that's what it is.

### “基本战略”

    “基本战略”
    据美联社报道，华盛顿政府对于东西方最高级会谈问题已经确定了一个“基本战略”，这就是：坚持“俄国应当首先以新的裁军让步来证明它的诚意”，否则艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯“就将竭力反对任何新的最高级会议”。
    为什么要这样呢？美联社的这则报道说，这是因为艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯越来越认为举行这样一个会谈是不可避免的了，但是他们对于这种谈判的前途却“丝毫没有信心”。
    显然，坚持要苏联作出让步云云，其目的并不是为了加强艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的“信心”，而是为了使他们能够“竭力反对”这种不可避免的会议。
    所谓“基本战略”，原来如此。
