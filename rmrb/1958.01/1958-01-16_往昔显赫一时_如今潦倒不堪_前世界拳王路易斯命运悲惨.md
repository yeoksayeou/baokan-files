    Formerly Glorious, Now Destitute
    The Tragic Fate of Former World Boxing Champion Louis

    American Black man Joe Louis, who once held the world heavyweight professional boxing championship for eleven consecutive years, is living in poverty. He needs to live to be one hundred and six years old to pay off his debt to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

    In early 1950, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service began pursuing Louis for taxes based on his boxing income from 1946 onwards. Louis fought on the boxing stage for fifteen years, his only hope being to save some money to raise his children. But not only was the only $66,000 he had saved for raising his children seized by the government, but he also owed the government more than $110,000. Later, his old debts remained unpaid, and new debts accumulated, plus interest. Now, Louis's debt has reached the staggering sum of $1.25 million.

    In order to settle his debts, Louis, who was almost forty years old, had to pick up his boxing gloves again, which he had put down for a long time. But his former glory was gone, his muscles were flabby, his reactions were slow, and he lacked strength. One night in October 1951, he was finally beaten until he was bloody and battered, and he fell on the boxing ring.

    To prevent tax collectors from bothering him, two years ago, at the age of forty-two, Louis had no choice but to participate in a kind of crude wrestling performance where he could grab his opponents at will to earn some money.

    Now, Louis's living expenses come from television broadcasts. He is often sick, but as soon as he recovers, he has to participate in wrestling matches again. The government wants him to repay at least $20,000 a year, but even if Louis can repay this amount every year, this former "King of Kings," who is already forty-four years old, would need to live for more than sixty years to pay off his debts.

### 往昔显赫一时　如今潦倒不堪  前世界拳王路易斯命运悲惨

    往昔显赫一时　如今潦倒不堪
    前世界拳王路易斯命运悲惨
    曾经连续十一年保持着世界重量级职业拳击冠军的美国黑人乔·路易斯生活窘迫，他需要活到一百零六岁才能还清欠美国所得税管理部门的债务。
    1950年初，美国所得税管理部门根据路易斯1946年起所得的拳击收入向他追收捐税。路易斯十五年转战于拳击台上，他唯一的希望是能为抚养孩子积蓄一笔钱，可是这时不仅他仅有的为抚养孩子而积蓄的六万六千美元被政府劫夺了，而且反而还欠下了政府十一万多美元。以后他的旧债未清，新债又欠下，加上利息，现在路易斯的债务已达到一百二十五万美元的惊人数目。
    由于要结清债务，已经快四十岁的路易斯只得重新拾起放下已久的拳击手套，但是当年的威风已不复回，他的肌肉松弛，反应迟缓，力不从心了。在1951年10月的一个夜晚，他终于被打得皮开肉裂，倒在拳击台上。
    为了征税者不去烦扰他，两年前四十二岁的路易斯只得沦落到参加一种可以任意乱抓对手的粗野的摔交表演，挣些钱。
    现在路易斯的生活费用是靠电视广播得来的。他时常得病，但病一好，他又不得不再去参加摔交比赛。政府要他每年至少还债两万美元，但是即使路易斯每年能还这个数目的话，这位已经四十四岁的前“王中之王”，还需要再活六十多年才能还清欠债。　（新华社）
