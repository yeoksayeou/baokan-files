Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: The Beijing Post Office has revised its profit delivery in this year’s plan from the original 140,000 yuan to 3,000,000 yuan, an increase of twenty-one times compared to the original plan.

When compiling the 1958 plan at the end of last year, the post office emphasized the changes in objective conditions such as the downsizing of cadres, the reduction of urban population, the tightening of institutions and savings in various units, and the extension of postal routes. It planned that business income would increase by 6% compared to last year, while expenditures would increase by 23%, thus reducing the profit delivery from last year’s actual performance of 1,680,000 yuan to 140,000 yuan. Later, after seeing the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and national undertakings, and after studying the People’s Daily editorial "We Must Adhere to the Policy of Achieving Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results," their thinking broadened. After further research, the factors that were previously considered unfavorable turned into favorable factors. The original plan was to use one train carriage for mail from Beijing to Lanzhou, but after calculation, only half a carriage was needed. In this way, rental fees could be reduced by 350,000 yuan per year. The original plan determined that the on-the-job cadre education fee for this year would be 28,000 yuan according to the standards stipulated by the higher authorities, an increase of nearly ten times compared to last year, but it has now been revised according to actual needs. The original plan was to replace fifty old bicycles with new ones this year, but in reality, they can still be used for several years with just some repairs. Based on the situation of cadres going to the countryside and the great development of rural production, they also plan to increase income by expanding mobile services, vigorously organizing book and newspaper distribution to rural areas, and increasing postal services to mountainous areas. Under these circumstances of considering issues according to actual conditions and actively finding ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, the bureau's profit delivery plan for this year increased twenty-one fold compared to the initially drafted plan.

### 北京市邮局推翻保守计划  上缴利润可增加二十一倍

    北京市邮局推翻保守计划
    上缴利润可增加二十一倍
    新华社24日讯　在北京市邮局今年的计划表上，上缴利润由原来的十四万元改成了三百万元，比原计划增加了二十一倍。
    这个邮局在去年底编制1958年计划时，强调干部下放、城市人口减少、各单位紧缩机构和节约以及邮路延长等客观条件的变化，计划业务收入比去年上升6％，支出增加23％，因此上缴利润由去年的实绩一百六十八万元降低到十四万元。后来，看到了工农业生产和国家各项事业大跃进的形势，又学习了人民日报社论“必须坚持多快好省的方针”，思想开阔了；经过再次研究，过去认为不利的因素却变成了有利因素。原计划由北京到兰州的邮件使用一个火车邮厢，经过计算，只要半节车厢就够了。这样，一年就可以少花租用费三十五万元。原计划按着上级规定的标准确定今年在职干部教育费为两万八千元，比去年增加了将近十倍，现在根据实际需要重新作了修改。原计划今年将五十辆旧自行车换上新车，实际上只要修理一下，还可以用几年。根据干部下放和农村生产大发展的情况，他们还计划通过扩大流动服务、大力组织书报下乡、增加去山区的邮政班次等办法，增加收入。在这种按实际情况考虑问题和积极想办法开源节流的情况下，这个局今年的上缴利润计划就较最初拟订的计划增长了二十一倍。
