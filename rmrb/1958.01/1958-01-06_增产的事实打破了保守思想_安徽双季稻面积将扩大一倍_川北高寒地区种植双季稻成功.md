The facts of increased production shatter conservative ideology.
Anhui will double its double-cropping rice acreage.
Successful double-cropping rice cultivation in high-altitude cold regions of northern Sichuan.
(Reported by this newspaper) Anhui Province has decided to expand its double-cropping rice planting area to seven million mu this year, nearly double that of 1957.

Planting double-cropping rice has been proven to be an effective measure for rapidly increasing yields in rice-producing areas. In 1956, the average yield of double-cropping rice in Anhui Province was over 490 jin per mu, while that of single-cropping rice was only over 370 jin. Tongcheng County, which saw a relatively significant increase in production last year, planted 320,000 mu of double-cropping rice, with an average yield of 768 jin per mu, which is 283 jin higher than the yield of single-cropping mid-season rice.

Anhui Province has gained considerable experience in planting double-cropping rice. Over the past few years, they have found many ways to solve problems related to crop rotation, varieties, fertilizers, labor and livestock power, and mastering the seasons.

Last year, some local cadres in Anhui had right-leaning conservative thoughts, so less double-cropping rice was planted than the year before. Because a bumper harvest was achieved from planting double-cropping rice last year, and the leadership has made preparations and gained experience, large-scale planting of double-cropping rice this year has become a common desire of cadres and the masses throughout the province.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 5th: The Jinniu First Agricultural Cooperative of Baicai Township, Zhaohua County, Sichuan Province, has created the "fire pit seedling cultivation" method, successfully trial-planting double-cropping rice for two consecutive years in mountainous areas around 32.5 degrees north latitude and 900 meters above sea level. This is currently the northernmost place in Sichuan Province to grow double-cropping rice.

This year, the agricultural cooperative planted 3.9 mu of double-cropping rice, with an average yield of over 899 jin per mu. In the past, double-cropping rice had never been planted in this area. In the spring of 1956, when the cooperative members were studying the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), they proposed the idea of planting double-cropping rice. Based on the local seasons, they calculated that as long as early rice could be transplanted in early March of the lunar calendar, they could guarantee continuous cropping of two seasons of rice. In order to solve the problem of low temperatures and frost before mid-February, which prevented seedlings from growing, they made many attempts and finally created the "fire pit seedling cultivation" method.

    增产的事实打破了保守思想
    安徽双季稻面积将扩大一倍
    川北高寒地区种植双季稻成功
    本报讯　安徽省决定在今年把双季稻种植面积扩大到七百万亩，这比1957年增加近一倍。
    种植双季稻已被证明是水稻产区迅速提高产量的有效措施。1956年，安徽全省双季稻平均每亩产量是四百九十多斤，但中稻仅三百七十多斤。去年增产比较突出的桐城县，种了三十二万亩双季稻，平均每亩产量七百六十八斤，比一季中稻产量高二百八十三斤。
    安徽省对种植双季稻已取得相当丰富的经验。几年来，在解决茬口、品种、肥料、劳畜力及掌握季节等方面，都找到了许多办法。
    去年，安徽有些地方干部有右倾保守思想，因此，种的双季稻比前年少了。由于去年种双季稻取得了丰收，领导方面又有了准备和经验，今年大量种植双季稻，便成了全省干部和群众普遍的愿望。
    据新华社成都5日电　四川省昭化县白菜乡金牛第一农业社，创造了“火坑育秧”的办法，在北纬约三二·五度、拔海九百公尺的山区，连续两年试种双季稻成功。这是目前四川省种双季稻最北的地方。
    今年，这个农业社种的三亩九分双季稻，平均每亩产量达到八百九十九斤多。过去，这一带地方从未种过双季稻。1956年春天，社员们在学习全国农业发展纲要（草案）时，提出了种双季稻的建议。他们根据当地季节计算出，只要能在旧历3月初栽插早稻，就能保证连作两季水稻。为了解决2月中旬以前气温低、霜期未过，秧苗无法生长的困难，他们做了许多尝试，最后创造出了“火坑育秧”的办法。
