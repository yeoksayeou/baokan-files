    Following penicillin, chloromycetin, and aureomycin, domestically produced streptomycin has recently been successfully trial-manufactured in Shanghai.
    In addition to its special efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis, streptomycin also has special efficacy against other forms of tuberculosis, such as tuberculous meningitis. In the past, this medicine we used was all imported. In recent years, through the collective research of three units, the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the State-owned Shanghai No. 3 Pharmaceutical Factory, intermediate trial manufacturing has been carried out successively. The trial-manufactured samples were sent to the Biological Products Appraisal Institute of the Ministry of Health for testing and were found to be fully qualified.

    上海制的链霉素
    继青霉素、氯霉素、金霉素之后，国产链霉素最近已在上海市试制成功。
    链霉素除了对肺结核有特别疗效外，对于脑结核等其它结核病，同样也有特别疗效。过去我们所用的这种药品都是进口货。几年来，经过中国科学院上海有机化学研究所、化学工业部上海医药工业研究所和国营上海第三制药厂等三个单位的集体研究，已先后进行了中间试制，试制的样品经送卫生部生物制品检定所检定，完全合格。
