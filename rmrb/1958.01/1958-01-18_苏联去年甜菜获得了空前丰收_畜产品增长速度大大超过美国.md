Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 17th: In 1957, the Soviet Union achieved an unprecedented sugar beet harvest. The amount of sugar beets obtained by the state from collective farms and state farms reached the highest level in Soviet history, totaling 38.4 million tons, an increase of 22% compared to 1956. Now, the Soviet Union's sugar beet production ranks first in the world. Whether in terms of total sugar beet production or per capita production, the Soviet Union surpasses the United States.

In 1957, the Soviet Union produced 16.3 million tons more sugar beets than in 1953, and approximately 7 million tons more than in 1956. During the period from 1950 to 1956, the total sugar beet production in the Soviet Union increased by 56%, while the sugar beet production in the United States decreased by 4% during the same period.

Due to the development of sugar beet cultivation, the Soviet Union's sugar-making industry has also developed rapidly. Currently, the Soviet sugar-making industry can process 40,000 tons of sugar per day. The sugar beets produced in 1957 can be processed into approximately 4.5 million tons of sugar, which is equivalent to 3.3 times the sugar production of Russia in 1913.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 17th: The Soviet livestock industry is advancing by leaps and bounds. In the past few years, the growth rate of livestock products has greatly exceeded the level of the United States.

In 1957, Soviet meat production increased by 14% compared to 1956, and milk increased by 11%. According to the 1958 plan, this year, Soviet meat production will increase by another 14% compared to last year, milk will increase by approximately 12%, and wool will increase by 12%. This rate of development is rare in the history of Soviet animal husbandry.

From 1950 to 1957, Soviet milk production increased from 35.3 million tons to 55 million tons, an increase of 19.7 million tons; while the United States only increased its milk production by 4.4 million tons during the same period. In 1950, the United States produced 17.9 million tons more milk than the Soviet Union, but by last year, it only produced 2.6 million tons more. During the period from 1950 to 1956, the growth rate of meat in the Soviet Union was equivalent to 1.5 times that of the United States, the growth rate of milk was equivalent to five times, and the growth rate of wool was equivalent to four times.

    苏联去年甜菜获得了空前丰收  畜产品增长速度大大超过美国
    据新华社莫斯科17日电　1957年，苏联甜菜获得了空前的丰收。国家从集体农庄和国营农场得到的甜菜达到苏联历史上最高的水平，共三千八百四十万吨，比1956年增加了22％。现在，苏联甜菜的产量占居世界第一位，无论就甜菜的总产量和按人口平均计算的产量来说，苏联都超过了美国。
    1957年，苏联生产的甜菜比1953年增加了一千六百三十万吨，比1956年增加了约七百万吨。在1950年到1956年期间，苏联甜菜总产量增加了56％，而美国的甜菜产量在同一时期却下降了4％。
    由于甜菜种植业的发展，苏联的制糖工业也迅速发展起来。现在，苏联制糖工业每天可以加工四万吨砂糖。1957年生产的甜菜可以加工出大约四百五十万吨砂糖，这相当于1913年俄国砂糖产量的三点三倍。
    据新华社莫斯科17日电　苏联畜牧业正在大踏步地前进，在过去几年，畜产品的增长速度大大地超过了美国水平。
    1957年，苏联肉类生产比1956年增加了14％，牛奶增加了11％。根据1958年的计划，今年苏联肉类的生产将比去年再增加14％，牛奶将增加约12％，羊毛增加12％。这种发展速度在苏联畜牧业史上是少有的。
    从1950年到1957年，苏联牛奶产量从三千五百三十万吨增加到五千五百万吨，即增加了一千九百七十万吨；而美国在同一时期牛奶产量只增加了四百四十万吨。在1950年，美国牛奶产量比苏联多一千七百九十万吨，而到去年就只多二百六十万吨。在1950年到1956年期间，苏联肉类的增长速度相当于美国的一点五倍，牛奶的增长速度相当于五倍，羊毛的增长速度相当于四倍。
