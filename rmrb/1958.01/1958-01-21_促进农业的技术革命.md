    Promoting the Technological Revolution in Agriculture
    Kong Sang
    Comrades from the Xiangyang Agricultural Machinery Factory who went to the countryside to conduct research not only carefully collected farmers' opinions and provided them to the factory to manufacture new products that are popular with farmers, but also went deep into the fields to directly teach farmers the technology of using and repairing the machines, so that the agricultural tools and machines produced by the factory could actually play a role in agricultural production. This is a very good practice and an important part of industrial support for agriculture. We hope that every agricultural machinery factory will follow suit.
    Machines going to the countryside is no small matter. This is a great beginning to technically transform agriculture and put it on the track of modernization. The promotion of each new type of agricultural tool or water conservancy machinery is laying a cornerstone for the technological revolution in agriculture.
    However, there are contradictions between the promotion of these new things and the traditional habits and backward cultural and technical levels of the countryside. Farmers buy machines but do not know how to install them, how to use them, or how to repair them when they are broken. How can this contradiction be resolved? Those who adopt a promoting attitude towards socialist construction will enthusiastically help farmers learn the technology of using and repairing, actively overcome the difficulties in promotion, and pave the way for these new things. However, there are also some people with conservative ideas. Whenever a new type of agricultural tool or agricultural machinery encounters a little difficulty in the process of promotion, they sigh and retreat. They do not deeply understand the nature of the difficulties, let alone find ways to overcome them, and they flatly assert: "This thing is no good! It cannot be promoted!" This was exactly the attitude that some places took towards the double-wheel double-share plow last year.
    Now, the experience of many places has confirmed that the double-wheel double-share plow can be used in both the South and the North, and the effect is much better than that of the wooden plow. The reason why it was not popular with farmers in some places in the past, resulting in backlog, was not because the double-wheel double-share plow was not good, but because the technical work did not keep up, the farmers were not taught how to use it, and no appropriate modifications were made according to local characteristics. Those comrades with conservative ideas did not deeply understand these problems, and rashly adopted a negative attitude, so that some double-wheel double-share plows that could have played a role lay idle in warehouses or agricultural cooperatives for two years. In the future, we will have more agricultural machinery going to the countryside. If we all adopt this conservative attitude, how can we promote the technological revolution in agriculture?
    We need to learn from the spirit of the comrades of Xiangyang Agricultural Machinery Factory. They used their labor to turn farmers from opponents of the double-wheel double-share plow into active supporters, and turned the "useless" waterwheels that were backlogged in warehouses into heroes on the drought-resistance front. The agricultural technological revolution needs just such pioneers.

    促进农业的技术革命
    孔桑
    襄阳农业机械厂派到农村作调查研究的同志，不仅仔细搜集农民的意见，提供给厂里据以制造出深受农民欢迎的新产品，而且深入田间直接给农民传授使用和修配的技术，使工厂造出的农具和机器在农业生产中实际发挥作用。这是一种非常好的做法，是工业支援农业的一项重要内容，我们希望每个农业机械工厂都起而仿效。
    机器下乡，这不是一件小事。这是对农业进行技术改造，把农业引上现代化的轨道的伟大开端。每一台新式农具或水利机械的推广，都是为农业的技术革命投下一块基石。
    但是，推广这些新东西，同农村的传统习惯和落后的文化技术水平存在着矛盾，农民买了机器不会安装，不会使用，坏了不会修理。怎样解决这个矛盾呢？对社会主义建设抱着促进态度的人，会满腔热情地帮助农民学会使用和修理的技术，积极克服推广中的困难，给这些新生的事物开辟道路。但是，也有一些有保守思想的人，每当一种新式农具或农业机械在推广过程中刚刚碰到一点困难的时候，他们就唉声叹气，打退堂鼓。他们没有深入了解困难的性质，更不去寻找克服困难的办法，便一口咬定：“这玩意儿不行啊！推广不开啊！”前年有些地方对待双轮双铧犁的态度就正是这样。
    现在，许多地方的经验证实，双轮双铧犁在南方北方都是可以使用的，效果比木犁好得多。过去有些地方所以不受农民欢迎，造成积压，并不是因为双轮双铧犁不好，而是因为技术工作没有跟上去，没有教会农民使用，没有根据地方的特点作适当的修改。那些有保守思想的同志，没有深入了解这些问题，就轻率地采取了消极的态度，以致使一部分本来可以发挥作用的双轮双铧犁白白地在仓库或农业社里睡了两年。今后，我们还会有更多的农业机械下乡，如果都采取这种保守态度，怎么能促进农业的技术革命呢？
    我们需要学习襄阳农业机械厂同志们的精神。他们用自己的劳动，使农民由双轮双铧犁的取消派变成了积极的拥护者，使积压在仓库里的“无用”的水车，变成了抗旱战线上的功臣。农业技术革命需要的正是这样的开路人。
