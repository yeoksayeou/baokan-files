How to Eliminate Overwintering Flies
　　Jiu Ru

Flies breed in filthy, damp places such as garbage dumps, rotten grass piles, and human and animal manure heaps. From birth to death, they go through four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult fly. In summer, it takes about ten days for an egg to develop into an adult fly. The female fly can lay eggs two to three days after mating. The eggs are milky white granules, which hatch into larvae, commonly known as "maggots," after eight to twenty-four hours. The larvae grow quickly. After emerging from the egg, they begin to wriggle and leave their breeding ground after four to eight days, crawling into the surrounding loose soil to become "pupae." The pupa is oval, about six and a half millimeters long, covered with a brownish-yellow shell. It neither eats nor moves, hiding in the soil one to five inches deep. In summer, it takes only four to five days to break out of the shell, emerge from the soil, and become an adult fly. If the weather is cold, the development of the pupa can be extended to five months. The average lifespan of a fly is about one month, with summer and autumn being the most active seasons. In winter, apart from a few that hide in warmer indoor locations to overwinter, most of them are in the pupal stage, hidden in the soil or manure heaps. In winter, their range of activity is very small, and their flying ability is weak. This is the weakest link in the life of a fly. Therefore, winter and spring are good times for us to eliminate them. We should seize the time in winter and spring to thoroughly eliminate the pupae. The following two methods are commonly used for killing pupae in winter and spring:

　　(1) Digging method: Fly pupae are generally hidden in the soil one to five inches deep near toilets, manure tanks, and garbage dumps. It is best to organize digging around the time of the frost and around the time of the awakening of insects. After freezing, you can also use boiling water to pour or burn the soil to loosen it, and then dig it out. The pupae can be scalded to death with boiling water after being dug out.

　　(2) Compacting soil to kill pupae: Before freezing or after thawing, compact the soil or manure heaps and manure pits where fly pupae are hiding. When compacting, it is best to compact it once first, then water it once, and then compact it again, repeating the compaction many times. The fly pupae in the soil or manure heap will be crushed to death. Even if they are not crushed to death, they will suffocate due to the hardness of the soil, preventing them from emerging.

　　(3) Using boiling water to irrigate manure: Some pupae are hidden in fertilizer piles and manure pits, which can be killed by irrigating them with boiling water. Use ten kilograms of boiling water for an area of one foot square; use four to five kilograms of boiling water for a manure tank with a diameter of three feet.

The following methods can be used to eliminate overwintering adult flies:

　　(1) Eliminate their breeding places. Properly dispose of manure, and keep toilets and chamber pots covered and sealed. Regularly clean the room to maintain cleanliness so that they cannot get drinks and cannot breed.

　　(2) Trapping method: Place flypaper in places where they often go. After the flypaper is full of flies, burn the paper in a fire. The method of making flypaper is: "Use eight parts of rosin powder, two parts of sesame oil (peanut oil or soybean oil), and two parts of honey, heat and mix them, or use one part of rosin and one part of tung oil with some sugar, mix them evenly, and apply them on a smooth piece of paper."

　　(3) Chemical killing method: Spray "223" or "666" in places where flies like to land or frequently enter and exit. Usage: 40 ml of 5% "223" oil or emulsion is needed per square meter, and the validity period is about two to three months; 12 to 15 ml of 0.5% "666" liquid or emulsion is needed per square meter, but the validity period is shorter than "223," about one month.

    怎样消灭越冬苍蝇
    九如
    苍蝇孳生在污秽、潮湿的垃圾堆、烂草堆及人畜的粪堆等场所，它从出生到死亡，要经过卵、幼虫、蛹、成蝇四个阶段。在夏天约有十天左右就可以由卵变为成蝇。雌蝇于交配后二到三天后便可以产卵。卵为乳白色的小粒，经过八到二十四小时后，就孵化为幼虫，也就是我们通常所见到的“蛆”。幼虫生长很快，从卵里出来，经过四到八天，就开始蠕动，离开孳生地，爬进周围的松土里变为“蛹”。蛹为椭圆形，长约六毫米半，披着棕黄色的外壳，不吃也不动，躲在一到五寸深的泥土里，在夏天，只要经过四到五天便破壳羽化，从泥土中钻出变为成蝇。如果天气冷，蛹的发育可以延长到五个月之久。苍蝇的寿命平均为一个月左右，以夏秋两季最旺盛，到冬季，除少数躲在较暖的室内过冬之外，主要是以它的蛹藏在泥土或粪堆中。在冬季，它的活动范围很小，而且飞跃力很弱，这是苍蝇生命中最薄弱的环节，因此，冬春正是我们消灭它的好时机。应当抓紧冬春的时间，彻底灭蛹。冬春常用的灭蛹法有以下两种：
    （1）挖蛹法：苍蝇的蛹一般都藏在厕所、粪缸、垃圾堆附近一至五寸深的泥土中，在霜降前后和惊蛰前后，组织起来进行挖掘为最好，上冻后，也可用开水浇或用火烧的办法使土变松，然后挖取。蛹挖出后可用开水把它烫死。
    （2）紧土灭蛹法：在上冻前或开冻后，把蝇蛹躲藏地的泥土或粪堆粪坑打紧压实，压时，最好先打压一遍，然后再浇一次水，再进行打压，反复打压多次，泥土或粪堆中的蝇蛹就被压死，即便压不死，但也因土硬钻不出来而窒死。
    （3）开水浇灌粪便法：有的蛹藏在肥堆及粪坑中，可用开水浇灌加以杀灭。一尺见方的面积，用开水十斤；三尺直径的粪缸可用开水四到五斤。
    对于越冬的成蝇，可以采用以下的消灭办法：
    （1）铲除它的孳生场所。妥善处理粪便，厕所，马桶要加盖密闭，经常打扫室内卫生，保持清洁，使之得不到饮料，无法孳生。
    （2）粘取法：将粘蝇纸放在它常去的地方，待苍蝇粘满后，将纸投入火中烧掉。粘蝇纸的做法是“用松香末八分，麻油（花生油、豆油均可）二分、蜂蜜二分加热拌调，或用松香、桐油各一分加一些糖，调和均匀后，涂在光滑的纸面上即成。
    （3）药物杀灭法：用“223”或“666”喷洒在苍蝇喜欢停落或经常出入的地方。用法：5％的“223”油剂或乳剂，每平方公尺需要喷洒四十毫升，有效期约为二到三个月；0.5％的“666”液剂或乳剂，每平方公尺需要喷洒十二到十五毫升，但有效期较“223”短，大约为一个月左右。
