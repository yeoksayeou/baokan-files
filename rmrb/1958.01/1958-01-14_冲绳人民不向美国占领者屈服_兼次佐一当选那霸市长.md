Xinhua News Agency, Naha, January 13th: Kamejiro Senaga, who opposes the American military occupation of Okinawa, won the Naha mayoral election held on the 12th. The American-backed candidate, Tatsuo Taira, the former chairman of the Socialist Masses Party, has been defeated. The outcome of this mayoral election in Naha, the capital of Okinawa, is another blow to the American plan for long-term military occupation of Okinawa.

According to preliminary statistics today, Kamejiro Senaga received approximately one thousand more votes than Tatsuo Taira, out of a total of approximately seventy thousand votes cast. Kamejiro is the candidate of the “League for the Protection of Democracy in Okinawa.” His main campaign slogan was: defend peace and oppose the United States turning Okinawa into a nuclear weapons base; immediately return Okinawa to Japan. He also advocated guaranteeing the democracy, freedom, and human rights of the people of Okinawa.

After Kamejiro was confirmed as the winner, his supporters gathered in front of his headquarters, cheering “Long live!” Kamejiro issued a statement expressing the hope that there would be no more forceful suppression of democratic politics. He also believed that democratic forces would win the Naha City Council election to be held in March this year.

Kamejiro also broadcast a speech to Japan today, saying that the people of Okinawa are tired of the American policy towards Okinawa. It is clear that the people of Okinawa are demanding new policies. Kamejiro said that he would inherit the path of the former mayor of Naha, Kamejiro Senaga.

Kamejiro Senaga, who opposed the American occupation policy, was forcibly removed from office by the American occupation authorities last November through brutal means. The United States used great efforts this time to support Tatsuo Taira, who favored the continued presence of American troops in Okinawa, but ultimately failed. United Press International admitted that this was another vote by the people of Okinawa demanding "Yankees go home."

The American authorities in Okinawa and the local ruling forces have long planned to continue making things difficult for Kamejiro Senaga. According to the president of the Ryukyu Bank on the 11th, if Kamejiro is elected, his bank will prohibit the city government from using American aid funds for Naha's municipal construction, just as it did with Kamejiro Senaga.

### 冲绳人民不向美国占领者屈服  兼次佐一当选那霸市长

    冲绳人民不向美国占领者屈服
    兼次佐一当选那霸市长
    新华社13日讯　那霸消息：反对美军占领冲绳岛的兼次佐一已经在12日举行的那霸市长竞选中取得胜利。美国支持的候选人、社会大众党前主席平良辰雄已经落选。这次冲绳岛首府那霸市的市长选举的结果，是对美国长期军事占领冲绳岛的计划的又一个打击。
    据今天初步的统计，在总共约七万张选票中，兼次佐一得票超过平良辰雄约一千票。兼次是冲绳岛“拥护民主主义联络协议会”的候选人。他提出的主要竞选口号是：保卫和平，反对美国把冲绳岛变成核武器基地；立即把冲绳岛归还日本。他并且主张保障冲绳岛人民的民主、自由和人权。
    在兼次确定当选以后，兼次的支持者聚集在他的总部的前面，欢呼“万岁”。兼次发表声明，表示希望不要再有强力来镇压民主政治。他并且相信民主势力会在今年3月举行的那霸市议会选举中获胜。
    兼次今天还向日本发表广播演说说，冲绳人民对美国对冲绳的政策感到厌倦。很显然，冲绳人民要求新的政策。兼次表示他要继承前任那霸市长濑长龟次郎的路线。
    反对美国占领政策的濑长龟次郎是在去年11月被美国占领当局用横暴的手段强迫去职的。美国这次用了很大的力量来支持赞成美军留驻冲绳的平良辰雄竞选，但是终于失败。合众社承认，这是冲绳岛人民再次投票要求“美国佬滚回去”。
    冲绳岛的美国当局和当地统治势力早已蓄谋要继续同兼次佐一为难。据琉球银行的行长在11日透露，如果兼次当选，他的银行就像对待濑长龟次郎一样，将禁止市政府动用美国对那霸市政建设的援助基金。
