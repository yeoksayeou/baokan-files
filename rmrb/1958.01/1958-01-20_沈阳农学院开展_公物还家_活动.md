Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 19th: Shenyang Agricultural College students, in implementing the policy of "running schools diligently and thriftily," are launching a "Return Public Property Home" campaign. In the past month, students across the college have returned more than 2,700 items of public property, including over 110 kinds of items such as books, furniture, glass instruments, internship and experiment equipment, and recreational and sports equipment.

In the past, the school's system for using and storing public property was very unsound. Some students did not cherish public property, and some even failed to distinguish between public and private, causing unnecessary losses to the state. According to the statistics of the Teaching Equipment Section, from September 1st to December 7th last year, 3,749 pieces of glass instruments were damaged, worth more than 1,400 yuan; some students used public petri dishes as their own soap boxes, ink boxes, or palette boxes, and some even used a large glass dish with a diameter of 25 centimeters to raise fish. During the rectification, all the students of Class 1, Grade 4 of the Agronomy Department of the college put forward the initiative of "Return Public Property Home" and took the lead in action, voluntarily returning public property and clearing up long-overdue lecture fees. This initiative was supported by the students of the whole college. Under the organization and leadership of the College Communist Youth League Committee, a college-wide wave of automatic and conscious return of public property was set off in the college.

    沈阳农学院开展“公物还家”活动
    新华社沈阳19日电　沈阳农学院学生贯彻“勤俭办学”方针，正在展开一个“公物还家”活动。全院学生在最近一个月里，交回公家物品二千七百多件，包括图书、家具、玻璃仪器、实习实验用具、文娱和体育器材等一百一十多种。
    这个学校过去使用和保管公物的制度很不健全。部分学生不爱护公物，有的学生甚至公私不分，给国家造成不应有的损失。据教学设备科统计，从去年9月1日到12月7日，损坏玻璃仪器三千七百四十九件，价值一千四百多元；有的学生用公家的培养皿，当自己的肥皂盒、墨盒或调色盒用，有人竟用一个直径二十五公分的大玻璃皿养起鱼来。整改中，这个学院农学系四年一班全班学生提出了“公物还家”的倡议，并带头行动起来，主动归还公家物品，还清理了拖欠很久的讲义费。这个倡议受到了全院学生的支持。在学院共青团团委的组织和领导下，学院里就掀起了全院性的自动自觉归还公家物品的浪潮。
