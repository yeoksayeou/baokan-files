    He Put on the Red Militia Armband Again
    The last few trains departing from Shanghai in 1957 stopped at the platform, welcoming the travelers who would spend the New Year on the train. Not far from the platform, near the Shanghai Locomotive Depot workshop, was a worker militia member who had participated in the attack on this station during the 1927 Shanghai workers' armed uprising. Tonight, he was wearing a red militia armband again, holding a flashlight, and patrolling vigilantly. But unlike thirty years ago, today he is guarding the revolutionary achievements of the working class. This old worker is Wang Shunqiu, the 53-year-old Communist Party member and leader of the locomotive electrical group at the Shanghai Locomotive Depot.
    Today, Wang Shunqiu's team, along with the workers from various groups in the washing and repair workshop, finished the washing and repair work on three locomotives at 3:30 in the afternoon. When the last locomotive was inspected and driven out of the workshop, they completed all the work executed during the first Five-Year Plan. Over the past five years, they have washed and repaired a total of 4,224 locomotives (times), exceeding the plan by 83 locomotives (times). Wang Shunqiu's team has been selected as an advanced group in Shanghai every year since 1954.
    Wang Shunqiu's team did not leave work early to rest because they finished their work ahead of schedule today. After work, the entire team carried out a New Year's Eve cleaning, and then held a meeting to discuss the work plan for January 1958. At night, Wang Shunqiu put on the militia armband and guarded near the workshop. He told the reporter: "I am an old worker, and I want to teach the revolutionary traditions of Shanghai workers to the young workers."

    他又套上了红色的纠察臂章
    1957年最后几列从上海出发的列车，停在站台上，迎候那些将要在列车上过年的旅客。离站台不远的上海机务段车间附近，有一个在1927年上海工人武装起义的时候参加过向这个车站冲锋的工人纠察队员，今夜臂膀上又套着红布纠察臂章，手里拿着电筒，在警惕地巡逻着。但是和三十年前不同的是，今天他是在守卫着工人阶级的革命成果。这个老工人是上海机务段机车电机组组长、五十三岁的共产党员王顺秋。
    今天，王顺秋领导的小组和洗修车间各组工人一起，在下午三点半就结束了三台机车的洗修工作。当最后一台机车验收完毕，驶出车间的时候，他们在第一个五年计划期间执行的全部工作结束了。五年来，他们一共洗修了四千二百二十四台（次）机车，比计划多修了八十三台（次）。王顺秋领导的小组从1954年以来，年年当选为上海市先进小组。
    王顺秋小组今天没有因为提早结束工作而下班休息，小组全体工人在下班以后进行了除夕大扫除，接着就开会讨论了1958年1月份的工作计划。夜晚，王顺秋套上了纠察的臂章守护在车间附近，他对记者说：“我是一个老工人，我要把上海工人的革命传统教给年轻的工人。”
