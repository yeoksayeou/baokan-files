Why is it not easy to catch a cold in the Arctic?

    I was asked this question during an exam in my fourth year at the Sichuan Medical College. Most of my classmates were stumped. After thinking for a long time, I vaguely answered: "The Arctic is very cold, and viruses are not easy to survive; at the same time, people do not often go out, and there is little contact between people, so it is not easy to catch a cold."

    Later I learned that my answer was not entirely correct. Although less contact between people reduces the transmission of colds, cold viruses still exist and are active in cold environments. The main reason why it is not easy to catch a cold in the Arctic is that houses in the Arctic and all other extremely cold regions are made of ice. Although the indoor temperature is higher than the outdoor temperature, the difference is not significant. Therefore, people can quickly adapt to the outdoor climate when they come out of the room and are less likely to catch a cold. Secondly, they often exercise in this icy environment all year round, and their body's cold resistance is very strong (metabolism also changes with the environment), so it is not easy to catch a cold.

    In winter, it is best to keep the indoor temperature not too much higher than the outdoor temperature, and to exercise outdoors regularly, so that we will not catch a cold easily when we get cold.

    Perhaps you will ask: "How do you know that it is not easy to catch a cold in the Arctic?" That is based on the speculation that no medical literature from all over the world in the past 50 years has mentioned colds in the Arctic. (Hu Wenyao)

### 为什么在北极不容易得伤风病？

    为什么在北极不容易得伤风病？
    我在四川医药院四年级的时候，就考过这个题目。当时大多数同学都楞住了。我想了半天，胡乱地解答：“北极非常寒冷，病毒不易生存；同时人们不常外出，人与人之间接触少，所以不易得伤风病。”
    后来知道，答的不全对。人与人接触少，固然会减少伤风病的传染，但伤风病毒在寒冷的环境里是仍然存在和活动着的。在北极所以不容易得伤风病，主要是北极以及其他一切极冷地区的房屋是用冰堆造成的，这样室内温度虽然比室外温度高些，但是相差不大。所以人从室内出来，能很快地适应室外气候而不致感冒。其次，他们常年在这种冰天雪地的环境里锻炼，身体的耐寒力很强（新陈代谢亦随环境而有改变），所以不易得伤风病。
    我们在冬天，最好也使室内温度不要过高于室外，并且经常在室外锻炼身体，也就不至于一受凉就伤风了。
    或许你会问：“何以知在北极不容易得伤风病？”那是根据五十年来世界各地医药文献上从没有谈到过北极有伤风病这一点来推测的。　（胡文尧）
