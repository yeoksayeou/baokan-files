　　The increasingly strong smell of oil emanating from the Sahara has deeply touched the heart of the American Mobil Oil Company. This company issued a statement a few days ago, openly expressing its "interest" in the Sahara.

　　Rockefeller has a "famous saying" that "What is good for Mobil Oil is good for America." Some of the recent actions of the United States in North Africa have been driven by this "interest" of Mobil Oil: the connection between the Tunisian arms supply incident and the Sahara oil is already well known; and the United States' decision to secretly support Libya against France in the border dispute between Libya and Algeria is definitely not unrelated to the discovery of rich oil deposits in the Edjele region of the Sahara near the Libyan border.

　　Given this, it is no wonder that the United States has recently shown so little interest in even verbally saying a hollow "acknowledgment of France's special status in North Africa."

    兴趣所在
    撒哈拉发出的越来越浓的石油气味已经深深打动了美国美孚油公司的心。这家公司在几天以前发表了一项声明，公开表示对撒哈拉“感到兴趣”。
    洛克菲勒有一句“名言”说：“对美孚油公司是好的，对美国也就是好的。”美国最近在北非的一些行动，正是由美孚油公司的这种“兴趣”所推动的：突尼斯军火供应事件和撒哈拉石油之间的联系已经尽人皆知；而美国决定在利比亚和阿尔及利亚的边境纠纷中暗中支持利比亚来反对法国，同在利比亚边境附近的撒哈拉埃德惹勒地区发现储量丰富的油矿也决不是无关的。
    既然这样，无怪乎美国最近连在口头上说一句“承认法国在北非的特殊地位”的空话都表现得这样毫无兴趣了。
