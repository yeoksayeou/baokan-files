　　Beijing middle schools are actively strengthening discipline education in order to cultivate middle school students with excellent morals.

　　The Education Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China once introduced the discipline education experience of the 14th Middle School in detail at a meeting of middle school principals. The main points of this school's experience are: "First, overcome the teachers' one-sided punitive thinking, adhere to patient persuasion education, and fully mobilize students to solve their own problems." After returning, many principals analyzed the students' discipline situation and the problems in conducting discipline education based on this experience, and formulated practical and feasible methods. Some middle schools sent people to the 14th Middle School to visit, interview, and hold discussions; some middle schools also invited teachers from the 14th Middle School to give reports on discipline education in order to further absorb specific experience and improve problems in discipline education.

　　In the past, classroom discipline and cleanliness in the 95th Middle School were generally not very good. After hearing about the experience of the 14th Middle School in carrying out discipline education, they were greatly inspired. They actively introduced the experience of the 14th Middle School to the faculty and staff and to the students, and mobilized everyone to solve the school's discipline problems. Under the guidance of the teachers, the students launched criticism and self-criticism, which had a great effect. There has been a significant improvement in classroom discipline and cleanliness. In the past, when Class 10 of the first grade had literature class, students often talked back to the teacher and were impolite to the teacher. This phenomenon no longer exists now, and this class has been promoted from a second-class class to a first-class class. A new atmosphere of unity and mutual assistance, respect for teachers, love of labor, and hard study has also been established among the students. Zhang Guangzhu, a student, used to be undisciplined and did not like to work. After the patient help of his classmates, he has also changed. Not only does he study hard, but he can also actively participate in extracurricular labor in the school and care about the affairs of the class. Once, he took the initiative to wipe all the desks in the class clean and also washed the toilet. Now he has been elected by everyone as the discipline inspector of the class. The teachers also realized that: to solve students' discipline problems, simply relying on punishment, struggle, and expulsion is not a fundamental solution, and it is necessary to patiently persuade and conduct ideological education. Wang Baoli, a student in Class 10 of the first grade, was criticized by his classmates for his poor discipline, and he quarreled with everyone and did not accept the criticism of the class teacher. At this time, the class teacher advocated holding a meeting to put pressure on him. The principal disagreed with this approach after learning about the experience of the 14th Middle School, saying that patient education must be adhered to. More than a dozen students in the class patiently reasoned with him, and as a result, Wang Baoli was moved and corrected his shortcomings with practical actions. Now he is performing very well. This fact made the teachers deeply feel that as a teacher, they must believe that on the basis of raising awareness, students can solve their own problems, and it is not enough to just put pressure on them. The 95th Middle School used the experience of the 14th Middle School to fully mobilize teachers and students, and initially changed the chaotic discipline situation. On this basis, the whole school formulated a discipline code: listen quietly in class and during self-study, be polite to teachers, take care of public property, always pay attention to cleanliness, and actively participate in interval exercises, as a direction for further efforts. The 55th Middle School mainly had poor classroom discipline in the past. After learning from the experience of the 14th Middle School in rectifying student discipline, there has also been a significant change. After teaching Class 7 of the second grade, the history teacher said with emotion: "I haven't taught such an easy class in half a year."

　　Now, it is becoming a trend for the majority of middle school students to abide by discipline. Students in some middle schools have also proposed: to continue to work hard to overcome the phenomenon of lax discipline and establish a new socialist school spirit.

    培养品德优良的中学生
    北京市中学积极加强纪律教育
    本报讯　为了培养品德优良的中学生，北京市中学积极加强纪律教育。
    中共北京市委教育部，曾经在各中学校长会议上，详细介绍了十四中的纪律教育经验，这个学校的经验主要是：“首先克服教师片面的惩办思想，坚持耐心说服教育，充分发动学生自己解决自己的问题”。很多校长回去后，根据这个经验，认真分析了学生纪律的情况和进行纪律教育中的问题，制定了切实可行的办法。有的中学派人到十四中参观、访问、座谈；有的中学还请十四中的教师做纪律教育报告，以便进一步吸取具体经验，改进纪律教育方面的问题。
    九十五中过去课堂纪律、清洁卫生一般是不太好的。他们听了十四中进行纪律教育的经验后，得到了很大的启发，积极在教职员中，在学生中介绍十四中的经验，并动员大家解决本校的纪律问题。在老师们的指导下，学生展开了批评与自我批评，收到了很大的效果。课堂上的纪律，清洁卫生有了显著的改进。初一十班过去上文学课时，学生经常和老师顶嘴，对老师没有礼貌。这种现象现在没有了，这个班还由二类班升为一类班。在学生中还树立了团结互助、尊师、热爱劳动、努力学习的新风气。学生张广珠过去不遵守纪律，不爱劳动，经过同学们耐心的帮助，现在也转变了，不仅努力学习，还能积极地参加校内课余劳动，也关心班内的事情了。有一次他主动地把班上的桌子全部擦得干干净净，还洗了厕所。现在他被大家推选为班上的纪律检查员。在教师中也认识到：解决学生的纪律问题，单纯靠处分、斗争、开除不是根本的办法，必须耐心地说服，进行思想教育。初一十班学生王宝立，同学们批评他纪律差，他和大家吵起来，班主任的批评也不接受。这时班主任主张开会给他压力。校长知道后不同意这种做法，根据十四中经验，要坚持耐心教育。班上十几个同学和他耐心讲道理，结果王宝立感动了，并以实际行动改正了自己缺点，现在表现很好。这个事实使老师们深深感到作为一个教师必须相信，在提高觉悟的基础上，学生自己能够解决自己的问题，光给压力是不行的。九十五中运用十四中的经验，充分发动老师、学生，初步改变了纪律混乱的状况。在这个基础上，全校制定了纪律公约：课堂上课、上自习要静听，对老师要有礼貌，爱护公共财物，经常注意清洁卫生，积极参加课间操，作为进一步努力的方向。五十五中过去主要是课堂纪律不好，经过学习十四中整顿学生纪律经验后，也有显著的改变。历史老师给二年级七班上课后感动地说：“半年来没有上过这样省事的课。”
    现在，广大中学生遵守纪律开始形成风气。有的中学学生们还提出：要继续努力克服纪律松弛的现象，树立社会主义的新校风。
