    Southward Journey Amidst the High Tide
    By Our Correspondent Fan Rongkang
    III. Shijiazhuang in Great Leap Forward
    Leaving Baoding, I arrived in Shijiazhuang.
    Although I have been to many large cities across the country, the grandeur of Shijiazhuang's city appearance still surprised me. The Zhonghua Road here is as wide as sixty meters. Although it is not as long as Chang'an Avenue in Beijing, it is more orderly than Chang'an Avenue. In the middle of the left and right carriageways, a green belt stretches straight forward, and the area occupied by the traffic police command post is comparable to a small square. The scale is so large that it is staggering. Moreover, there are more than one similar roads and "squares" in Shijiazhuang.
    However, on these wide roads, there are very few motor vehicles. Bicycles and tricycles can rush around, and pedestrians are not bound by traffic rules. They can stride forward on the street. All of these make people feel that Shijiazhuang does not need such wide roads.
    It turns out that these roads are legacies of Japanese imperialist aggression. Shijiazhuang was a military stronghold in North China in those years, the intersection of the Beijing-Hankou, Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang-Dezhou railways, and the gateway to and from Shanxi. In order to permanently occupy Shijiazhuang, the Japanese imperialists, on the one hand, amassed heavy troops here, and on the other hand, carried out large-scale construction. They plundered the blood and sweat of the Chinese people, locked the Chinese people into the prison of hunger, but paved wide roads and built beautiful buildings in Shijiazhuang. Today, when people walk through these large roads that are extremely disproportionate to the city's production level and living standards, they still cannot forget the pain and resentment of being reduced to slaves.
    Shijiazhuang has been a well-known place for a long time. After the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Zhengtai Railway connected here at the beginning of the 20th century, Shijiazhuang began to prosper. But after forty years, Shijiazhuang only developed into a small city with a population of more than 90,000 with commerce as the center; including farmers in the suburbs, there were only more than 190,000 people. Although this is one of the largest cotton-producing areas in China, the yield of cotton per unit area is high, the fiber is long, and the underground water source in Shijiazhuang is extremely abundant, making it an extremely ideal place to build a textile industry. However, in the past forty years, only one Da Xing Yarn Factory with 10,000 spindles has been built in Shijiazhuang. As for other industries, that goes without saying.
    In November 1947, the Chinese People's Liberation Army crushed the Kuomintang's so-called "permanent fortifications with steel and concrete inside and trenches and electric nets outside" and liberated Shijiazhuang. Counting from that time to now, it has been exactly ten years. In the past ten years, Shijiazhuang's construction can be said to be thriving and has a brand new look. According to comrades from the Municipal Economic Planning Commission, 62 large and relatively large factories have been built in the past ten years, with an average of less than two months for a new factory to be put into production. There are also 44 projects that are about to be completed and are under construction. The newly added building area in the city is more than one and a half times larger than the entire building area of old Shijiazhuang. The city's population, including the suburban population, has reached more than 630,000. Now, Shijiazhuang has been expanded to the east of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway. There, a new industrial zone and urban area have taken initial shape. I took a car with Xu Shangbin, deputy director of the Municipal Construction Bureau, to visit the new urban area. Although Shijiazhuang's urban planning is relatively good, especially the layout of the industrial area is quite compact, the car still drove for nearly an hour before generally traversing the main streets of the new urban area.
    In these ten years, the textile industry in Shijiazhuang has developed the fastest. The newly built State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 are larger than the other; together with a large-scale printing and dyeing factory under construction, these five factories form a huge textile printing and dyeing joint enterprise. In addition, the Shijiazhuang Textile Factory invested by the local government and the joint state-private Huaxin Textile Factory are also of considerable scale, each with 50,000 spindles. The original Da Xing Yarn Factory has also become a large factory with 50,000 spindles after expansion. At present, Shijiazhuang has more than 460,000 spindles, which is more than 40 times more than in 1948, equivalent to the total number of spindles accumulated by Tianjin, which is famous for its developed textile industry, in the sixty years before liberation.
    Walking east from this large-scale textile printing and dyeing joint enterprise, there is another brand-new pharmaceutical industry joint enterprise. The scale of this pharmaceutical industry joint enterprise and the advanced equipment are unique in the country. A little further north from here, the newly built Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant has been put into production. The power generation capacity of its first phase of construction is nine times greater than the total power generation capacity of old Shijiazhuang. Going south, you can see the tractor repair and assembly plant and the drilling machinery repair and assembly plant under construction. It is also planned to build a steel plant in this area this year.
    Due to the successive commissioning of new factories, the total output value of newly built enterprises in Shijiazhuang currently accounts for 75% of the city's total industrial output value. The output of many major industrial products has increased not several times, but more than ten or dozens of times compared with 1948. For example, the output of cotton yarn has increased more than 40 times compared with 1948, the output of cotton cloth has increased more than 70 times, and the output of electricity and flour has increased more than ten times.
    When I came to Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang's industry was in the midst of a Great Leap Forward. Here, as early as the beginning of December last year, the new upsurge in production that emerged with the rectification campaign had swept the city. After the central government proposed to catch up with Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years, people's hearts were even more excited. Subsequently, news of the agricultural Great Leap Forward was frequently reported. The workers of Shijiazhuang were all eager to try. On December 24, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the city's conference of advanced producers and youth activists in increasing production and practicing economy, called for a Great Leap Forward in industrial production as well. At the meeting, 24 collectives and individuals respectively put forward their proposals to catch up with the advanced, comprehensively overfulfill the state plan, and challenge the workers of the city and the province, and some even pointed the spearhead of the challenge at the whole country. On the spot, more than 290 collectives and individuals responded to the proposals and accepted the challenges. A upsurge of comparing with the advanced and catching up with the advanced quickly spread throughout the city.
    Comparing with the advanced and catching up with the advanced includes four comparisons and four catches: The first is to compare within the factory and catch up with the advanced level of the factory; the second is to compare with the advanced factories in the city and catch up with the advanced level of the city; the third is to compare with the advanced indicators in the country and catch up with the advanced level of the country; the fourth is to find international standards and catch up with international standards. In these boiling days, the most concerned about by the leading cadres of various enterprises is where there are advanced indicators, why are they advanced, and how can we catch up with the advanced? At present, most enterprises have formulated or are formulating leap forward plans. The product quality of the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory used to be very low, and the rate of first-class products and second-class products was less than 50% in total. They proposed to catch up with the famous Shanghai Huafeng Enamel Factory. Now the product quality of this factory has been greatly improved. In December last year, the rate of first-class products and second-class products reached 80%, and recently the rate of first-class products of some groups has reached 63%. Shijiazhuang's textile enterprises are relatively advanced in saving cotton and reducing the net amount of cotton used per yarn, but the quality of cloth is far behind Tianjin, Beijing and other places. They are studying how to catch up in terms of quality. The slogan put forward by the Shijiazhuang Textile Factory is: "Do two years' work in one year, catch up with the advanced indicators in various places, and strive to take the lead in some aspects." The Shijiazhuang power system proposed to catch up with the United Kingdom in terms of coal consumption and plant power consumption indicators within this year.
    The competition among workers is even more active. Yue Shutang, Hu Bingyue, and Ju Ruilin, workers at the scutching section of the Shijiazhuang Textile Factory, proposed the initiative of "no rejection of ten thousand volumes," which once shocked the city. Who knew that after a few days, latecomers would rise to the top. When the reporter left Shijiazhuang, the most advanced indicator was "no rejection of 25,000 volumes" proposed by Peng Junxiang and Xing Shulin from the State-owned Cotton Factory No. 3. Wang Xinnian, a famous advanced producer and young worker at the Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory, issued a challenge at the city's conference of advanced producers and youth activists in increasing production and practicing economy, with the guarantee of completing the workload of the Second Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. At the meeting, his peer, Wang Junping, a young worker at the Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory, rose to the challenge with the condition of completing the Second Five-Year Plan one year and two and a half months ahead of schedule. After responding to the challenge, Wang Junping pondered day and night to improve the tools. On the first working day of 1958, his new tool was successfully tested, increasing production efficiency by 178%. On January 12, at the mobilization meeting of all the young people in the factory to march towards the Second Five-Year Plan, he revised the original challenge conditions to complete the Second Five-Year Plan one year, six months and five days ahead of schedule. Wang Xinnian was not to be outdone. This young advanced producer researched new measures and found more potential from improving production tools, shortening auxiliary working hours, and promoting advanced experience. On January 19, he announced the revision of his proposal to complete the Second Five-Year Plan one year, seven months and twenty days ahead of schedule. Now this competition has just begun, and it is difficult to predict who will win in the future.
    The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is keeping a close eye on organizing the Great Leap Forward in industrial production. Kang Xiumin, secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, put forward the following requirements for the city's Great Leap Forward: "A small step in January, a big step in a quarter." On January 8, the Municipal Party Committee held a symposium attended by party secretaries, factory directors, and engineering and technical personnel from various factories and mines to compare the Leap Forward. Such meetings are still being held in departments. Comrades from the Industrial Department of the Municipal Party Committee said that the main direction of their organization of the Great Leap Forward in industrial production is right-leaning conservative thinking. This right-leaning conservative thinking is manifested in different forms at different times. In the past period, it was mainly manifested in the underestimation of the situation that a new upsurge in production would inevitably appear with the rectification campaign, emphasizing that the institutions had just been streamlined, the cadres had just been transferred, and the new working order had not yet been improved, and it was impossible for an upsurge to occur. Some even made analogies, saying: "It's like a tree that has just been moved from here to there, and hasn't taken root yet, how can it blossom and bear fruit?" As a result, the masses used new creations and new records to shatter this understanding that opposed the production upsurge and the establishment of working order. However, right-leaning conservative thinking has not been completely resolved. Can we leap forward, dare we leap forward? Some cadres are still hesitant. The more advanced factories are afraid that if the targets are set too high, they will not be able to complete them and their reputation will be ruined; the factories with poorer work emphasize difficulties and dare not compare with the advanced factories. As a result, when some enterprises were formulating their 1958 plans, they still adopted the so-called "average plus advanced" quotas, which were slightly higher than the average of last year, and were lower than the level already reached in the fourth quarter of last year.
    In criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, some enterprises in Shijiazhuang adopted the methods of detailed accounting and large-scale debates. The Shijiazhuang Textile Factory organized various workshops and sections to analyze and debate around the topics of whether to be a promoter or a drag, and why we can't do what others can, and the emotions were extremely warm. The responsible cadres of the pre-spinning workshop admitted that they had been drag. The director of the winding machine workshop said that he was center-right, which was a little stronger than the drag. The head of the supply and marketing section stated at the factory-wide cadre meeting that he would be a promoter, but the quota of working capital he proposed was immediately refuted by clerk Liu Shunyi as "it can be completed even if you sit down." After this lively debate, the leap forward targets put forward by the leaders of the Shijiazhuang Textile Factory have been broken through by the masses.
    Wang Zhongbo, Minister of the Industrial Department of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said: "Now it is indeed a thousand miles a day. The proposed targets at the city's conference of advanced producers and youth activists in increasing production and practicing economy were still advanced at the time, but now many of them are lagging behind and are being revised. The development of the movement is so fast!" For this reason, no one dared to come up with absolute figures for the level to which Shijiazhuang's industry will leap forward in 1958 until the day the reporter left the city.

    在高潮中南行

    三、跃进中的石家庄
    离了保定，来到石家庄。
    尽管我走过全国的许多大城市，石家庄市容的壮观依然使我吃惊。这里的中华路宽达六十公尺，它虽然没有北京的东西长安街那么长，却比东西长安街更整齐。左右车行道中间，一条绿化带笔直地向前伸展，交通警指挥岗所占的面积比得上一个小小的广场。气派之大，令人咋舌。而且，类似的马路和“广场”，在石家庄还不止一处。
    然而，在这些宽阔的马路上，机动车辆非常稀少，自行车和三轮车可以横冲直闯，行人更是不受交通规则的约束，可以在大街上昂首阔步。这些，都使人感到石家庄并不需要这样宽阔的马路。
    原来，这些马路是日本帝国主义侵略的遗迹。石家庄是当年华北的军事重镇，京汉、石太和石德三条铁路的交叉点，又是出入山西的门户。日本帝国主义为图永远霸占石家庄，一面在这里屯集重兵，一面在这里大兴土木。他们搜括了中国人民的血汗，把中国人民锁入饥饿之牢，却在石家庄铺起了宽阔的马路，盖起了漂亮的楼房。今天，当人们走过这些同这个城市的生产水平和生活水平极不相称的大马路时，依然不能忘记沦为人奴的痛苦和愤恨。
    石家庄成为一个知名的地方由来已久。二十世纪之初，京汉铁路和正太铁路在这里接轨之后，石家庄就开始繁荣起来。但经过四十年之后，石家庄才发展成为一个以商业为中心的九万多人口的小城市；连郊区农民在内，也不过十九万多人。虽然这里是我国最大的产棉区中心之一，棉花单位面积的产量高，纤维长，石家庄市的地下水源又极其丰富，是建设纺织工业极其理想的地方，但四十年来，在石家庄只建成了一个一万纱锭的大兴纱厂。至于其他工业，那就更不用说了。
    1947年11月，中国人民解放军粉碎了国民党所谓“内为钢骨水泥、外加壕沟电网”的“永久性工事”，解放了石家庄。从那时候算起，到现在已整整十年了。这十年来，石家庄的建设事业可说是蒸蒸日上，面貌全新。据市经济计划委员会的同志谈，十年中共建成了大型的和比较大型的工厂六十二个，平均不到两个月就有一座新工厂投入生产，即将完工和正在施工的项目还有四十四个。全市新增加的建筑面积比旧石家庄的全部建筑面积还大一倍半多。全市人口，包括郊区人口在内，已达六十三万多人。现在，石家庄市已扩建到京广铁路以东的地区去。那里，新的工业区和市区已经初步形成。我同市建设局副局长徐尚斌坐着小汽车去参观新市区。尽管石家庄的城市规划是做得比较好的，特别是工业区的布局相当紧凑，但汽车仍然行驶了近一个小时，才大体上走完了新市区的主要街道。
    这十年中，石家庄的工业以棉纺织工业发展最快。新建的国棉一厂、二厂、三厂、四厂，规模一个比一个大；加上一个正在建设的大型印染厂，这五个工厂组成了一个巨大的纺织印染联合企业。此外，地方投资的石家庄纺织厂和公私合营的华新纺织厂规模也不小，各有五万纱锭。原有的大兴纱厂经过扩建，也成为一个五万纱锭的大厂。目前，石家庄市拥有纱锭四十六万多枚，比1948年增加了四十多倍，相当于以纺织工业发达著称的天津市解放前六十年积累的纱锭总数。
    从这个规模宏大的纺织印染联合企业往东走，又是一个崭新的医药工业联合企业。这个医药工业联合企业规模之大，设备之先进，在全国是独一无二的。由这里稍往北一点，新建的石家庄热电厂已经投入生产。它的第一期工程的发电能力，就比旧石家庄的全部发电能力大九倍。往南去，又可以看见正在建设的拖拉机修配厂和钻探机械修配厂。今年还准备在这一带建设钢铁厂。
    由于新工厂纷纷投入生产，目前石家庄新建企业的生产总值，已占全市工业总产值的75％。许多主要工业产品的产量，同1948年相比，不是增长了几倍，而是十几倍、几十倍。例如棉纱的产量已比1948年增加了四十多倍，棉布的产量增加了七十多倍，电力和面粉的产量都增加了十几倍。
    我来到石家庄的时候，石家庄的工业正处在一个大跃进的浪潮中。这里，早在去年12月初，随着整改高潮而出现的生产新高潮已经席卷全市。中央提出十五年后在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国的号召后，人心更是振奋。接着，农业大跃进的消息频传，石家庄的工人们无不磨拳擦掌，跃跃欲试。12月24日，中共石家庄市委会在全市先进生产者代表和青年增产节约积极分子大会上，号召工业生产也来一个大跃进。会上，二十四个集体和个人，分别提出自己赶上先进、全面超额完成国家计划的倡议，向全市和全省的工人挑战，有的并把挑战的矛头指向全国。当场就有二百九十多个集体和个人响应倡议、接受挑战。一个比先进、赶先进的热潮由此迅速向全市蔓延开来。
    比先进、赶先进，共有四比四赶：一是在工厂内部比，赶本厂的先进水平；二是同市内先进厂比，赶本市的先进水平；三是同全国的先进指标比，赶全国的先进水平；四是找得到国际标准的，赶国际标准。在这些沸腾的日子里，各个企业领导干部最关心的，莫过于那里有先进指标，为什么先进，我们怎样才能赶上先进？现在，大部分企业已经订出了或者正在制订跃进规划。石家庄搪瓷厂过去的产品质量很低，甲级品率和乙级品率总共还不到50％，他们提出要赶上著名的上海华丰搪瓷厂。现在这个厂的产品质量已大有提高，去年12月份，甲级品率和乙级品率已达80％，最近有些小组的甲级品率已达63％。石家庄的纺织企业在节约用棉，降低每件纱的净用棉量上，比较先进，但布匹的质量远远落在天津、北京等地后面，他们正研究要在质量方面赶上去。石家庄纺织厂提出的口号是：“一年做两年工作，赶上各地先进指标，争取在某些方面领先”。石家庄电力系统提出今年内要在煤耗和厂用电指标上赶上英国。
    工人之间的竞赛更是活跃。石家庄纺织厂清花车间挡车工岳书堂、胡丙月、剧瑞林提出“万卷不退”的倡议，曾经震动全市。谁知过了不几天，后来者纷纷居上。到记者离开石家庄的时候，最先进的指标是国棉三厂彭俊祥、邢树林提出的“二万五千卷不退”。著名的先进生产者、石家庄货车修理工厂青年工人王新年，在全市先进生产者代表和青年增产节约积极分子大会上，以提前一年完成第二个五年计划工作量的保证条件，发出挑战。会上，他的同行、石家庄动力机械厂的青年工人王均平，以提前一年两个半月完成第二个五年计划的条件，起来应战。应战之后，王均平日夜琢磨改进工具，1958年的第一个劳动日，他的新工具试验成功，提高生产效率178％。1月12日，他在全厂青年向第二个五年计划进军誓师大会上，修改原来的应战条件，要提前一年六个月零五天完成第二个五年计划。王新年也不落后，这个年青的先进生产者研究出新的措施，从改进生产工具、缩短辅助工时、推广先进经验中找到了更多的潜力，1月19日，他宣布修改倡议，要提前一年七个月零二十天完成第二个五年计划。现在这场竞赛还刚刚开始，将来“鹿死谁手”难以逆料。
    中共石家庄市委会对组织工业生产大跃进抓得很紧。市委书记康修民对全市的跃进提出的要求是：“一月一小步、一季一大步”。1月8日，市委召开了有各厂矿党委书记、厂长、工程技术人员等参加的座谈会，比跃进。这样的会议还在分部门继续举行中。市委工业部的同志们说，他们组织工业生产大跃进的主攻方向是右倾保守思想。这种右倾保守思想在不同的时期表现为不同的形式。过去一个时期，主要表现为对随着整改高潮必将出现一个生产新高潮的形势估计不足，强调机构刚紧缩，干部刚下放，新的工作秩序尚未健全，不可能出现高潮。有的甚至打譬喻说：“好比一棵树，刚从这儿移到哪儿，还没有生根，怎能开花结果呢？”结果，群众用新创造、新纪录，粉碎了这种把生产高潮和建立工作秩序对立起来的认识。但是，右倾保守思想并没有就此完全解决，能不能跃进、敢不敢跃进？仍有些干部是犹疑的。先进点的厂，怕指标订高了，完不成，名誉扫地；工作差一点的厂，强调困难，不敢同先进厂比。以致有些企业在订1958年计划时，仍采用比去年平均数略加提高的所谓“平均加先进”的定额，低于去年第四季度已经达到的水平。
    在批判右倾保守思想上，石家庄有些企业采用了算细账、大辩论的方法。石家庄纺织厂围绕着当促进派还是当促退派，人家能办到的我们为什么不能办到等题目，组织各个车间和科室分析辩论，情绪极为热烈。前纺车间的负责干部承认自己做了促退派。筒机车间的主任说他是中间偏右，比促退派多少强一些。供销科长在全厂干部大会上表示要当促进派，但他提出的流动资金定额当场被科员刘顺义驳为“坐着也能完成”。经过这场生动活泼的大辩论，石家庄纺织厂领导上所提出的跃进指标，已纷纷被群众突破。
    中共石家庄市委工业部王仲波部长说：“现在确实是一日千里。全市先进生产者代表和青年增产节约积极分子大会上所提出的倡议指标，当时看来还是先进的，但现在有许多都落后了，正在纷纷修订。运动的发展真快呵！”正因为这个原因，1958年石家庄的工业究竟将跃进到什么水平，截至记者离开这个城市的那天为止，还没有人敢拿出绝对数字来。
