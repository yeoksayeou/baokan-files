    Half-Monthly Agricultural Situation
    "Minor Cold" (January 6th) - "Major Cold" (January 20th)
    In mid-January, most parts of the country were hit by cold air. Freeze prevention before the arrival of cold waves became an important part of field management for overwintering crops in many areas. Taking Zhejiang Province as an example, several special districts were urgently mobilized for this matter. In Ningbo Special District, 580,000 people persisted in freeze prevention work in the cold wind on January 14th. In Haining County, more than 300,000 mu of summer-ripening crop fields were earthed up, covered with grass, and fertilized during this cold wave resistance. These areas also paid attention to the protection of draught cattle in their freeze prevention work.
    This year, freeze prevention work in the South was generally done in a timely manner, and many areas made arrangements overnight after receiving cold wave warnings.
    From January 11th, most parts of the country experienced snow and rain. There has been little snow in northern areas since the beginning of winter, and the rainfall in the Yangtze River basin has also been insufficient recently. This snowfall is beneficial to soil moisture conservation and overwintering crops in farmland.
    Many wheat-growing areas in the North seized the opportunity after the snowfall to accumulate snow for moisture retention. In Kaifeng Special District, Henan, an average of 700,000 people participated in snow accumulation every day for several days after the snowfall. Encouraged by the slogan "A load of snow, a load of manure; a cart of snow, a dou of grain," members of agricultural cooperatives in Dengfeng County in this special district transported more than 6 million loads of snow to wheat fields in two days.
    Many areas began preparations for spring plowing during this period. Some agricultural cooperatives in the Northeast, where the season is later, also began preparing for farming. Agricultural cooperatives in various townships of Zhangwu County, Liaoning Province, broke the old habit of not preparing for farming before the Spring Festival and began sending manure, repairing farm tools, and carefully selecting seeds after "Minor Cold." According to local farmers, the time for sending manure here this year is about two months earlier than in previous years. Some agricultural cooperatives in other areas have also managed to send manure earlier in their preparations for farming.
    Many areas have built toilets, pigsties, and cattle pens on a large scale during the manure accumulation campaign. In the Huaibei area of Anhui, there are more than 72,000 capital construction teams for manure accumulation, with more than 400,000 people participating in the construction of toilets and pens, with the goal of "everyone having a toilet and every pig having a pen" before this year's Spring Festival.
    The construction or expansion of basic infrastructure for manure accumulation is a new phenomenon that has emerged in this year's manure accumulation campaign. This will create favorable conditions for the full utilization of human and animal waste and the establishment of a year-round manure accumulation system.

### 半月农情  “小寒”（1月6日）——“大寒”（1月20日）

    半月农情
    “小寒”（1月6日）——“大寒”（1月20日）
    1月中旬，全国大部地区都受到冷空气的侵袭。寒潮到来以前的防冻成为许多地区越冬作物田间管理的重要项目。以浙江省说，几个专区都为这件事情紧急动员起来；宁波专区在1月14日就有五十八万人在寒风中坚持防冻工作；海宁县三十多万亩夏熟作物田，都在这次抗御寒潮中，培上了土，盖上了草和施了肥料。这些地区在防冻工作中，还注意了耕牛的保护。
    今年南方的防冻工作一般作得及时，不少地区在得到寒潮警报以后就连夜作了部署。
    由1月11日起全国大部分地区下了雪和雨。北方地区入冬以来下雪很少，长江流域近来雨量也不够，这次雨雪对农田保墒和越冬作物都有好处。
    北方许多种麦区在雪后突击积雪保墒。河南开封专区在下雪以后几天里，每天平均有七十万人参加积雪。这个专区的登封县的农业社社员们，在“一担雪，一担粪；一车雪，一斗粮”口号鼓舞下，两天向麦田里运了六百多万担雪。
    不少地区在这个阶段里开始了准备春耕的活动。季节较晚的东北地区也有一些农业社开始备耕。辽宁省彰武县各乡农业社打破了过去不过春节不备耕的老习惯，在“小寒”以后就开始送粪、检修农具和精选种子。据当地农民反映，今年这里送粪的时间比往年提早两个月左右。别的地区一些农业社在备耕中也作到了提早送粪。
    许多地区在积肥运动里大规模地修建了厕所、猪圈和牛栏。安徽淮北地区有七万二千多个积肥基建队，四十多万人参加修建厕所、栏圈的工作，预计在今年春节以前作到“人有厕所，猪有圈”。
    兴建或扩大积肥的基本建设，是今年积肥运动里出现的一种新气象。这样作将给充分利用人畜粪尿和建立常年积肥制度造成良好条件。
