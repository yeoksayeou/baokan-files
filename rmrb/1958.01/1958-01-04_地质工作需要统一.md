    Geological Work Needs to be Unified
    Wang Hanfu
    Finding underground mineral resources is a prerequisite for the country's economic construction and industrial production, especially heavy industrial construction and production. The progress and achievements of geological work are related to the rational allocation of the country's productive forces and the speed and scale of industrial construction. Only by exploring rich fuel resources is it possible to establish a power base for industry, transportation, and agriculture, and to meet the needs of cities and industry for fuel. Only by exploring various metal minerals is it possible to establish iron and steel bases, as well as smelting centers for non-ferrous metals, rare metals, and precious metals. Only by exploring various non-metallic minerals is it possible to meet the needs of the chemical industry, building materials industry, agricultural fertilizers, and other various uses for mineral raw materials.
    Geological work in old China was extremely backward, and underground mineral resources were unknown. Since liberation, the Party and the government have attached great importance to geological work, constantly caring for and strongly supporting it. In the past few years, geological work has developed rapidly and achieved significant achievements, proving that China's underground mineral deposits are extremely rich. The proven industrial reserves of tungsten, tin, and molybdenum already rank first in the world; the industrial reserves of iron, copper, lead-zinc, coal, phosphorus, etc., also occupy an important position in the world; there have also been significant new discoveries in oil resources.
    In the early days of the People's Republic, due to the weak geological exploration force of the Ministry of Geology, and the country's urgent need for several major mineral resources, the country adopted a policy of multi-faceted development, simultaneous advancement, and giving play to the enthusiasm of all parties in geological work, in order to solve the contradiction of small forces, large tasks, and urgent demands. This was necessary and therefore correct at the time. Now the geological exploration force of the Ministry of Geology has grown stronger, and the several major minerals needed by the country have been initially guaranteed, not only meeting the needs of the Second Five-Year Plan, but also meeting the needs of the Third Five-Year Plan in some cases. Under such new circumstances, if geological work is still carried out in a decentralized manner by several departments, it will affect the further development of geological work and cause unnecessary losses to the country.
    What problems exist in current geological work?
    First, various ore deposits are often comprehensive ore deposits. Many iron ores contain utilizable copper, cobalt, vanadium, and rare earths. Most copper ores contain pyrite, lead-zinc, molybdenum, cobalt, gold, and silver. Tungsten and tin ores often contain copper, molybdenum, bismuth, cadmium, beryllium, and zirconium. Aluminum clay, pyrite, oil shale, and sometimes even germanium are often associated with coalfields in northern China. Other rare metals and dispersed elements are also symbiotic with other metal minerals. In the era of peaceful use of atomic energy, the position of radioactive uranium in minerals is becoming increasingly important. It is a very active element, widely present in all rocks and strata, and often concentrated in coal mines, iron mines, phosphate rock, and non-ferrous metal and rare metal deposits. Conducting a survey of radioactive uranium ore while prospecting and exploring these minerals is an important task today. Therefore, when prospecting and exploring a certain mineral, geologists must conduct comprehensive research and analysis, survey all minerals and useful minerals in a certain area, and propose a comprehensive development and utilization plan. This is an important aspect of geological work in implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. But the current situation is not like this. Geological personnel from a certain department are only responsible for finding the certain mineral they need and do not pay attention to other associated useful minerals. For example, geological personnel from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry do not care about fuel and general non-metallic minerals; geological personnel from the Ministry of Coal Industry are not interested in metal and non-metallic minerals. This will result in the loss of many associated useful minerals. Sometimes Team A just surveyed for coal in a certain place, and then Team B goes to survey for refractory clay, or two geological teams survey for different minerals in the same area at the same time, which seriously wastes manpower, materials, and financial resources.
    Second, due to unclear division of labor, insufficient cooperation, and failure to seriously implement the geological work registration system, the phenomenon of competing for production areas and overlapping work often occurs. According to incomplete statistics, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the Ministry of Coal Industry had thirty-three cases of overlapping geological work in 1956 and fifty-one cases in 1957, causing some unnecessary friction and disputes. In the spring of 1957, the Geological Bureau of the State Economic Commission invited relevant departments twice to negotiate and deal with the problem of overlapping geological work, and as a result, some problems were resolved, while others could not be resolved for a long time. For example, the Hefeng phosphate mine in Hubei, the Jinling iron mine in Shandong, and the Suixi coal mine in Anhui were all disputed by the two ministries, each refusing to yield. In southern Guangdong, geological teams from two different departments met in the field, and neither side would give way. Finally, the Provincial People's Committee was asked to resolve the issue by artificially dividing a mining area by taking a mountain top in the mining area as the boundary, affecting the geological inference and comprehensive evaluation of the mining area.
    Third, the major mining areas of iron, copper, lead, coal, phosphorus, etc., have been vigorously surveyed and explored in recent years, and can initially guarantee the country's mining needs. However, because these minerals are relatively easy to explore and there is experience, various departments are still keen on exploring these minerals, and are unwilling to vigorously find nickel, chromium, and rare metals that the country urgently needs. Everyone is also more keen on finding large deposits, and unwilling to find medium and small deposits, which hinders the implementation of the central government's policy of combining the construction of large enterprises with the construction of medium and small enterprises.
    Fourth, in recent years, various mining industrial departments have concentrated their geological forces on finding resources for newly built factories and mines, and have not given due attention to the geological work of producing mines. For example, some mines are blindly mined without geological exploration, resulting in disrupting the mining system and damaging the mines. Some adopt backward mining methods, and the mining recovery rate is very low. For example, the loss rate of some coal mines is as high as 40% or more. Some producing mining areas are in danger of stopping production and reducing production due to insufficient prospecting and exploration in the periphery and unclear resources. As for the situation where associated useful minerals are lost in the mining, ore dressing, and smelting process due to the lack of comprehensive research and rational utilization of mineral raw materials, it is even more common. For example, the Jinling iron mine contains copper, nickel, cobalt, vanadium, etc., none of which have been extracted and utilized. Tungsten mines in Jiangxi mostly contain copper, molybdenum, lead, bismuth, beryllium, and gold, and very few are recovered and utilized.
    Fifth, there are currently a total of fifty-eight provincial-level geological institutions across the country that belong to various central ministries, and many provinces have four to seven. Each geological institution has its own laboratory, equipment supply station, mechanical repair shop, and transportation system, with large institutions, overlapping layers, and waste of technical personnel and administrative management cadres. Moreover, each ministry has its own norms, quotas, operating procedures, and technical manuals, each doing its own thing, unable to exchange experience, and lacking unified ore utilization standards.
    To overcome the above shortcomings, to carry out prospecting and exploration in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, it is necessary to unify the current geological work scattered in various departments to the Ministry of Geology. The Ministry of Geology should conduct comprehensive and integrated geological research on the entire national territory, and conduct prospecting and exploration of all minerals. In this way, the Ministry of Geology can make comprehensive arrangements for the exploration of all minerals needed by the country; strive to balance the regional distribution of several major minerals such as coal, iron, and phosphorus; comprehensively consider the ore deposits needed by large enterprises and medium and small enterprises; conduct comprehensive and integrated research on the geological work of any region, and investigate and evaluate everything from water resources to uranium ore research; be responsible for the unified centralized storage and management of all national geological data, in order to give full play to the role of geological data; conduct unified registration of various geological work carried out by various departments across the country, in order to avoid the waste caused by the duplication of geological work; formulate unified operating procedures and production quotas, and unify ore utilization standards and reserve review systems, in order to ensure the rational construction of geological exploration and mining enterprises; this can greatly reduce work costs, improve work quality, and can streamline administrative management agencies, rationally use cadres, and is more conducive to completing and overfulfilling exploration plans.
    The necessary geological personnel left behind by various mining industrial departments should conduct industrial development exploration in the mining area, and upgrade the designed reserves to high-level reserves; carry out "exploring the edges and getting to the bottom" work in the periphery of the mine, so that the mine reserves continue to grow. For mining areas that are being mined or under construction, conduct large-scale geological mapping to further clarify the stratigraphic structure, in order to meet the needs of modern large-scale production. At the same time, do a good job in mine geological work to ensure the rational exploitation of ore deposits and the comprehensive utilization of associated useful minerals. This can not only ensure the planned mining of the mine, but also greatly improve the quality of mining.
    The issue of the unification of geological work has been brewing since the spring of 1955, and the party and government leading organs of many provinces and geological workers of various ministries have warmly supported this proposal. Now that the First Five-Year Plan has ended and the Second Five-Year Plan has begun, the country has put forward more arduous tasks for geological work, and it should be considered that the time to solve this problem is ripe. The Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Ministry of Building Materials have always supported this proposal, and have recently merged or will merge their geological institutions into the Ministry of Geology. However, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Coal Industry, which have the most relationship, the greatest impact, and possess huge geological institutions, are still hesitant about this issue. It is said that some people are worried that mineral resources will not be guaranteed after the geological institutions are merged into the Ministry of Geology. In fact, this worry is unfounded. Can the powerful and unified collective force that is concentrated not complete the tasks that the geological forces scattered in various departments can complete?

    地质工作需要统一
    王含馥
    寻找地下矿产资源，是国家进行经济建设和工业生产，特别是重工业建设和生产的先决条件。地质工作的进展和成就，关系着国家生产力的合理配置，关系着工业建设的速度和规模。只有探明了丰富的燃料资源，才有可能建立工业、运输业和农业的动力基地，才有可能满足城市和工业对燃料的需要。只有探明了各种金属矿产，才有可能建立钢铁基地，以及有色金属、稀有金属和贵重金属的冶炼中心。只有探明了各种非金属矿产，才有可能满足化学工业、建筑材料工业、农业肥料和其他各种用途所需要的矿物原料。
    旧中国的地质工作是极其落后的，地下矿产资源是不明的。解放以来，党和政府极重视地质工作，经常关怀和大力支持。几年来地质工作有了飞跃的发展，并获得重大成就，证明我国地下矿藏是极为丰富的。已探明的钨、锡、钼的工业储量，已占世界第一位；铁、铜、铅锌、煤、磷等的工业储量，也在世界上占有重要地位；石油资源也有重大的新发现。
    建国初期，由于地质部的地质勘探力量薄弱，以及国家对几种主要矿产资源的要求又非常迫切，国家对地质工作采取了多方发展，齐头并进，发挥各方面积极性的方针，以解决力量小、任务大、要求急的矛盾。这在当时是必需的，因而也是正确的。现在地质部的地质勘探力量已经壮大，国家所需要的几种主要矿产已有了初步保证，不仅满足了第二个五年建设计划的需要，有的还满足了第三个五年建设计划的需要。在这样新的情况下，如果地质工作仍由几个部门分散进行，就会影响地质工作的进一步发展，就会给国家造成不应有损失。
    当前的地质工作存在着哪些问题呢？
    一、各种矿床往往都是综合性的矿床。不少的铁矿中含有可资利用的铜、钴、钒和稀土等。大多数的铜矿中含有黄铁矿、铅锌、钼、钴、金和银等。钨和锡矿中常含有铜、钼、铋、镉、铍和锆等。我国北部煤田中常伴生有铝质粘土、黄铁矿、油页岩，有的还含有锗等。其他稀有金属和分散元素也都与其他金属矿共生。在和平利用原子能时代，放射性铀在矿产中的地位日见重要。它是一种极活泼的元素，普遍存在于所有岩石和地层中，并常汇集在煤矿、铁矿、磷块岩以及有色金属和稀有金属矿床中。在普查勘探这些矿产时，顺便普查放射性铀矿，更是当前一项重要任务。所以，地质工作者在普查勘探某种矿产的时候，必须进行全面研究和综合分析，将某一地区的所有矿产和有用矿物勘查清楚，提出全面开发和综合利用的方案。这是地质工作贯彻执行多快好省的方针的一个重要方面。但目前的情况却不是这样。某一部门的地质人员，只负责找他们所需要的某种矿产，对其他伴生的有用矿物不予注意。例如冶金工业部的地质人员对燃料和一般非金属矿产不去过问；煤炭工业部的地质人员对金属和非金属矿产不感兴趣。这样就会丢失很多伴生的有用矿物。有时甲地质队刚在某地勘查了煤，接着乙地质队又去勘查耐火粘土，或者两个地质队在同一地区同时勘查各不相同的矿产，这就严重地浪费了人力、物力和财力。
    二、由于分工不明，协作不够，又没有认真地实行地质工作登记制度，互争产地，工作重复的现象经常发生。据不完全统计，地质部、冶金工业部和煤炭工业部，在1956年的地质工作中相重复的有三十三起，1957年有五十一起，引起一些不必要的摩擦和纠纷。1957年春天国家经济委员会地质局曾两次邀请有关部门协商处理地质工作相重复的问题，结果有的解决了，有的长期解决不了。如湖北鹤峰磷矿、山东金岭铁矿、安徽濉溪煤矿等，都是两部相争，各不相让。在广东南部，有两个不同部门的地质队在野外相遇，双方互不相让，最后请省人民委员会解决，以矿区的一个山头为界，把一个矿区人为地分了家，影响了对该矿区的地质推断和全面评价。
    三、铁、铜、铅、煤、磷等主要矿区，经过几年来的大力勘查，已能初步保证国家开采的需要。但由于这些矿产比较易于勘探，又有了经验，各部还在热中于勘探这些矿产，而不愿意大力寻找国家十分需要的镍、铬和稀有金属。大家也比较热中于寻找大型矿床，而不愿意寻找中、小型矿床，这就妨碍中央关于大型企业和中、小型企业建设相结合的方针的贯彻执行。
    四、几年来各采矿工业部都把地质力量集中在为新建厂矿寻找资源上面，对生产矿山的地质工作，没有给以应有的注意。如有的矿山未经地质勘探，即盲目开采，结果搞乱了开采系统，破坏了矿山。有的采用落后的开采方法，开采回收率很低，如有的煤矿损失率高达40％以上。有的生产矿区因外围的普查勘探做得不够，资源不明，有停产减产的危险。至于因对矿物原料缺乏综合研究和合理利用，在采矿、选矿和冶炼过程中丢失伴生有用矿物的情况，更为普遍。如金岭铁矿中含铜、镍、钴、钒等，都没有被提取利用。江西钨矿中多含有铜、钼、铅、铋、铍和金等，回收利用的也很少。
    五、现在全国分属于中央各部的省一级地质机构共五十八个，不少的省份有四个到七个。每个地质机构都有自己的化验室、器材供应站、机械修配厂和交通运输系统，机构庞大，层次重叠，浪费了技术人员和行政管理干部。而且各部都有自己的规范、定额、操作规程和技术手册等，各搞一套，各行其是，不能互相交流经验，缺乏统一的矿石利用标准。
    要克服上述缺点，要又多又快又好又省地进行普查勘探，就需要把当前分散在各部的地质工作统一于地质部。由地质部对全国领土进行全面的、综合的地质研究，对全部矿产进行普查和勘探。这样，地质部就可对国家所需要的一切矿产的勘探，进行全面安排；对几种主要矿产如煤、铁、磷等的地区分布，力求平衡；对大型企业和中、小型企业所需要的矿床，统筹兼顾；对任何一个地区的地质工作，进行全面的、综合的研究，从水的资源到铀矿的研究，都要调查清楚，并予以评价；负责统一集中和保管全国所有地质资料，以充分发挥地质资料的作用；对全国各部所进行的各种地质工作，进行统一登记，以避免地质工作重复并行所造成的浪费；制定统一的操作规程和生产定额，统一矿石利用标准和储量审查制度，以保证地质勘探和矿山企业的合理建设；这就可以大大的降低工作成本，提高工作质量，并可以精简行政管理机构，合理地使用干部，更利于完成和超额完成勘探计划。
    各采矿工业部门留下来的必要的地质人员，在采矿区内进行工业开发勘探，将设计储量提升为高级储量；在矿山外围进行“探边摸底”工作，使矿山储量继续增长。对正在开采或正在建设的矿区，进行大比例尺的地质填图，进一步弄清地层构造，以适应近代化大规模生产的需要。同时，要做好矿井地质工作，以保证合理开采矿床和综合利用伴生有用矿物。这既可以保证矿山有计划地开采，又能大大提高开采质量。
    关于地质工作的统一问题，从1955年春天起就酝酿了，许多省的党政领导机关和各部的地质工作人员，都热烈拥护这一主张。现在第一个五年计划已经结束，第二个五年计划已经开始，国家对地质工作提出了更为艰巨的任务，应该认为解决这一问题的时机已经成熟。化学工业部和建筑材料工业部一向是拥护这一主张的，并于最近将他们的地质机构合并或将要合并到地质部来。但关系最多、影响最大、拥有庞大的地质机构的冶金工业部和煤炭工业部，对这一问题还在犹豫中。据说，有人担心将地质机构合并到地质部后，矿产资源没有保证。其实这种担心是没有根据的，难道分散在各部的地质力量能够完成的任务，集中起来的强大的统一的集体力量反而完不成吗？
