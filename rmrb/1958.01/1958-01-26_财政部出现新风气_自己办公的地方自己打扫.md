Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: A method of cadres taking turns cleaning their own offices every day according to a duty roster has been implemented throughout the entire Ministry of Finance.

Not long ago, one day at noon, people were having lunch in the Ministry of Finance's cafeteria. At this time, the loudspeaker announced a hygiene inspection message: "According to the inspection, the Personnel Department did not clean up. There is a lot of dust in the Cadre Division's room, and there is loose paper on the ground..."

When Wang Chengyuan, the Director of the Personnel Department, heard that the Personnel Department was being criticized, he used his lunch break to take off his coat, roll up his sleeves, and clean his office himself. The various divisions of the Personnel Department also took time that day to clean according to Wang Chengyuan's instructions.

Next door to Wang Chengyuan was the office of Guo Zhaoying, the Party Committee Secretary. After Guo Zhaoying saw Wang Chengyuan cleaning his office, he felt that his own office was not clean enough, so he followed suit and cleaned it. When the various units of the Party Committee saw the Party Committee Secretary cleaning his own office, they also cleaned their offices the next day.

The next day, Wang Chengyuan told the service staff that he would be responsible for cleaning his office from now on, and the cadres of each division would clean their own offices. From then on, after work every day, the cadres would clean their offices according to the duty roster.

    财政部出现新风气
    自己办公的地方自己打扫
    据新华社25日讯　每天按着值日表由干部轮流打扫办公室的办法，已经在财政部全机关推行。
    不久前的一天中午，财政部食堂里，人们正在吃中饭。这时，广播器中传出了检查卫生的消息说：“根据检查，人事司没有进行扫除，干部处屋内尘土很多，地上有乱纸……。”
    人事司司长王程远听人事司挨批评了，就利用中午休息时间，脱掉上衣，卷起袖子，自己打扫了办公室，人事司各处室也根据王程远的嘱咐在当天抽时间进行了打扫。
    王程远的隔壁是党委书记郭兆瑛的办公室。郭兆瑛看到王程远打扫办公室以后，感到自己的办公室也不够干净，就跟着进行了打扫。党委各单位看到党委书记自己打扫办公室，第二天也都打扫了办公室。
    第二天，王程远告诉服务员说，以后他的办公室由他自己负责打扫，各处室也由干部自己打扫。从此，每天下班后，干部就按着值日表打扫办公室。
