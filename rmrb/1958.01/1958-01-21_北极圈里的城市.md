    Cities in the Arctic Circle
    Norilsk is a city located on the coast of the Laptev Sea on the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia, USSR, within the Arctic Circle. It is currently the dead of winter with the Arctic night, experiencing twenty-four hours of darkness. Previously, this area was sparsely populated and lacked even kerosene lamps, but it has undergone significant changes. Norilsk is rapidly growing, with an increasing population and the continuous construction of new buildings, equipped with numerous electric lights to dispel the darkness of the Arctic night. In the next five years, 400,000 square meters of residential space will be built here.
    Last December, the power workers of Norilsk celebrated the 15th anniversary of the establishment of their thermal power center. Due to automation, the number of staff at this thermal power center has been reduced by 30%, and many heavy manual labor tasks have been replaced by machines.
    The city's skyline is often illuminated by flashes of light, emanating from the smelting plant during iron production.
    Residents living in this place where winter brings perpetual darkness are deprived of sunlight. The City Soviet is deeply concerned about the health of the residents and has decided that every enterprise, organization, and school must install artificial sun lamps to ensure the well-being of all working people. Artificial sun lamps have become good friends to the people of Norilsk.

    北极圈里的城市
    诺里尔斯克是苏联西伯利亚泰米尔半岛拉普底夫海沿岸的一个城市，位于北极圈里，现在正是隆冬的北极夜，一天二十四小时都没有太阳。以前，这里人烟稀少，连煤油灯都没有，而现在却有很大的变化。诺里尔斯克在迅速成长中，人口在增加，新的建筑物不断地落成，并且安装了大量电灯，以驱散北极夜的黑暗。在今后五年内，这里将建成四十万平方公尺的住宅面积。
    去年12月，诺里尔斯克的电力工作者纪念他们的热电中心建立十五周年。由于自动化，这个热电中心的工作人员减少了30％，许多繁重的体力劳动都用机器代替了。
    城市上空常常闪耀着火光，这是冶金联合工厂在出铁。
    居住在这个冬天整天是黑夜的地方的居民，得不到太阳光的照射。市苏维埃非常关心居民的健康，决定每个企业、机关和学校都要设置人工太阳灯的设备，以便保证每一个劳动人民的健康。人工太阳灯成了诺里尔斯克人的好朋友。
