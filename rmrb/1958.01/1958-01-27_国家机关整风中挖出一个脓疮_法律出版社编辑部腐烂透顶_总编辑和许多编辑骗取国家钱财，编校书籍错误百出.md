A Purulent Sore Dug Up in National机关Rectification
The Legal Publishing House Editorial Department is Utterly Rotten.
The Editor-in-Chief and Many Editors Embezzle State Funds, and the Editing and Proofreading of Books are Full of Errors.

    (Our Report) Relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses in the rectification campaign, the Legal Publishing House exposed the shocking and serious problems that have long existed in the areas of soliciting contributions, commissioning articles, editing, proofreading, and financial management.
    Since its establishment in 1955, the Legal Publishing House has published only 223 books. However, it lost 160,000 yuan in the last 21 months alone. At one point, due to cumulative losses, it had to sell the purchased paper to pay staff salaries. The quality of the books published by this unit is very low, and many are shoddy, creating a very bad impression among readers. Last year, the publishing house published "Legal Forms of Collective Farm Management." The entire book had 60,000 words, and there were more than 5,000 revisions made to the final proofs alone. Because there was no final draft before typesetting, it was necessary to carry out this kind of labor and material-wasting work on the proofs. 95% of the books published by the Legal Publishing House are in this "unfinished draft" state. According to incomplete statistics, the waste caused by this amounted to 6,940 yuan. The "Soviet Russian Civil Code" published by the publishing house has many errors. This code has a total of 523 articles. After publication, readers and colleagues within the publishing house revealed and checked that 22 articles were found to be missing or had dropped sentences, 135 articles were mistranslated, and 24 articles were translated insufficiently clear. More seriously, the book "Judicial Psychiatry" published by the publishing house, after a recent preliminary inspection, found more than 10,000 places of mistranslation, omissions, dropped paragraphs, and line breaks. In it, "Renaissance" was translated as "the Resurrection of Jesus," and "immune from revocation" was translated as "regarding revocation." But books with such numerous errors were still published.
    In the subject selection plan and contract for manuscripts of the publishing house there is a book entitled "Soviet Enterprise Management." Why did the Legal Publishing House publish a book on enterprise management? It turned out that the author of this book had written legal books, so his book on enterprise management also became a legal book. This shows how shockingly blind the subject selection and manuscript commissioning work of this publishing house is.
    The reason for such serious problems in the Legal Publishing House is that the staff of the editorial department are keen on "spare-time writing," or in their words, "doing side jobs." Chen Yutong, the deputy director and editor-in-chief of the publishing house, is one of those enthusiastic about "doing side jobs." In order to "do side jobs," although Chen Yutong did not know any foreign languages, he still signed a contract with the editorial department to proofread the Russian translation of "History of the Soviet Procuratorate System." How could he proofread if he didn't know any foreign languages? Chen Yutong had a way. He found an assistant editor who had a rudimentary knowledge of Russian to proofread for him, and he himself did the Chinese processing. After the book was translated, even he himself felt that it was "translated too badly, difficult to publish," but in order to get the royalties, he still signed it off for typesetting. In this way, he received 1,650 yuan in royalties. After getting this batch of royalties, Chen Yutong's interest in getting money grew even bigger, and he signed a contract with the editorial department in the name of his seven-year-old daughter to compile a "Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on Law," and he prepaid 300 yuan in royalties. Two years have passed, and there is still no sign of this book.
    Since the deputy director and editor-in-chief could get money like this, others could of course get money like this, so the trend of "doing side jobs" became prevalent. For example, editor Zhao Hanyu signed a contract with the editorial department to proofread and translate four books in his spare time, receiving 8,800 yuan in royalties. Editors-in-chief, editors, and assistant editors had to "burn the midnight oil" and "do side jobs" five days out of ten. When they worked during the day, they dozed off. Zhao Hanyu often "did side jobs" at night, and was listless and sleepy when he came to work, so the legal dictionary that he was responsible for proofreading and publishing had large sections of missing and mistranslated content. Editor Li Shikai also "did side jobs," and the books he proofread were also full of errors.
    Not only that, but some editors, in order to "do side jobs," also fabricated fake translators and authors and signed contracts with the editorial department, took on all the subject selections, and then organized "underground factories" to produce shoddy work and defraud royalties. Some editors used their authority to give subject selections to relatives and friends who were incompetent for this work in order to profit from them. Assistant editors Cheng Ming and Wang Qichang used the method of organizing "underground factories" to defraud more than 2,000 yuan in royalties. Guo Bingyi, the former director of the office of the publishing house, used his authority to introduce a friend who knew nothing about legal business to translate "Roman Law" and defrauded more than 2,300 yuan in royalties. Some people not only defrauded the publishing house of royalties, but also openly extorted from authors and translators. Assistant editor Cheng Ming knew that a certain translator had published a book in the publishing house, so he went to extort 200 yuan. Another assistant editor, Wang Qichang, in order to have a big meal at a restaurant, forcibly extorted 40 yuan from a translator who had published a book in the publishing house. How could such an editorial department edit and publish high-quality books?
    The lives of Chen Yutong and other editors were also very corrupt and depraved. In order to eat, drink, play, and be merry to his heart's content, Chen Yutong could abandon his work during office hours and invite some people from the publishing house who were in cahoots with him to go to parks, stroll the streets, dance, and eat in restaurants. According to statistics for four consecutive months last year alone, Chen Yutong took a public car 119 times for these private matters. In Chen Yutong's office, the sound of mahjong tiles could often be heard, and sometimes they even played so hard that they forgot to eat and sleep, and did not disperse until late at night.
    The Ministry of Justice, which directly leads the Legal Publishing House, was not unaware of the seriousness of the problems of the Legal Publishing House. As early as 1956, someone had reported to the leaders of the Ministry of Justice, but because a few leading comrades of the Ministry of Justice did not fully recognize Chen Yutong's serious mistakes, they only gave him a simple criticism. Therefore, the problems of the Legal Publishing House not only were not resolved, but became more serious, and finally caused irreparable losses to the Party and the state. The rectification campaign finally awakened these leaders like a wake-up call. Now, as the rectification campaign enters the stage of in-depth rectification and reform, the Ministry of Justice directly leads the Legal Publishing House and mobilizes the masses to conduct in-depth and serious exposure and inspection of these serious problems, and draw serious lessons from them, in order to prepare for comprehensively improving the work of this publishing house; and suspended Chen Yutong from all his positions inside and outside the Party, ordering him to examine and reflect on his actions, and await disposition. This is indeed a major gain in the rectification campaign of the Ministry of Justice and the Legal Publishing House.

    国家机关整风中挖出一个脓疮
    法律出版社编辑部腐烂透顶
    总编辑和许多编辑骗取国家钱财，编校书籍错误百出
    本报讯　法律出版社在整风中依靠群众、发动群众，揭露了这个社在组稿、约稿、编辑、校订、财务管理等各方面长期存在着的、令人吃惊的严重问题。
    法律出版社从1955年成立到现在一共只出版了二百二十三种书。但是，它在最近的二十一个月中就赔了十六万元，有个时期因为赔累，不得不把买来的纸张再卖出去以发放工作人员的薪金。这个单位所出的书，质量很低，有许多都是粗制滥造的，在读者中造成了很坏的影响。该社去年出版了一种：“集体农庄管理的法律形式”，全书一共六万字，发排后仅在最后清样上修改的就有五千多处。因为发排前没有定稿，只好在清样上进行这种浪费人力和物力的工作。法律出版社有95％的书，都是这种“未定稿”，据不完全的统计，因此造成的浪费竟达六千九百四十元。该社出版的“苏俄民法典”错误很多，这本法典共计五百二十三条，出版后经读者揭发和社内同志们的检查，已发现漏译和掉句的有二十二条，错译的一百三十五条，译的不够明确的二十四条。更严重的是该社出版的“司法精神病学”一书，经过最近初步检查，这本书错译、漏译、掉段、拉行的共约一万余处，里面把“文艺复兴时代”译成“耶稣复活时代”，“免于撤销”译成“关于撤销”。但是这样错误百出的书也照样出版了。
    在该社选题计划和约稿合同上有这样一本书，书名叫“苏维埃的企业管理”。法律出版社为什么出版企业管理的书呢？原来这本书的作者曾经写过法律书籍，所以他所著的企业管理的书也变成法律书籍了。由此可见这个社的选题和约稿工作的盲目性是如何惊人。
    法律出版社发生这样严重的问题，是因为这个社的编辑部的工作人员热衷于“业余写作”，用他们的话来说，“搞业余”。这个社的副社长兼总编辑陈于彤就是热心“搞业余”的一个。为了“搞业余”，陈于彤虽然不会外文，但仍与编辑部订合同，要校订俄文译稿“苏维埃检察制度史”。不会外文，怎么能校订呢？陈于彤有的是办法，他找了一个初懂俄文的助理编辑代他校订，自己做中文加工。书译出后，连他自己也觉得“译得太坏，难于出版”，但他为了拿稿费，仍签字发排。这样，他就拿了一千六百五十元的稿费。搞到这批稿费之后，陈于彤搞钱的兴趣更大，又用他的七岁女儿的名字，与编辑部签订合同，要编译一本“马恩列斯论法律”，于是他又预支了稿费三百元。两年过去了，还没有看到这本书的影子。
    副社长兼总编辑既然可以这样搞钱，其他人当然也可以这样搞钱，于是“搞业余”之风就盛行起来。如编辑赵涵舆与编辑部订合同，在业余时间校订和翻译书四部，拿稿费八千八百元。总编辑、编辑、助理编辑，十天有五天要“开夜车”“搞业余”，白天工作时，就打瞌睡。赵涵舆就因为他经常在夜里“搞业余”，白天上班没精打采、昏昏欲睡，因此，由他负责校订出版的法律词典，就出现了大段大段的漏排和错译。编辑李士楷也因为“搞业余”，他所校订的书也是错误百出。
    不但如此，有的编辑为了“搞业余”，还捏造假译者、作者与编辑部签订合同，包揽选题，然后组织“地下工厂”，粗制滥造，骗取稿费。有的编辑则利用职权把选题交与不能胜任这一工作的亲戚和朋友，以便从中获利。助理编辑程铭、王琪昌等就用组织“地下工厂”的办法骗取了稿费两千多元。该社前办公室主任郭秉毅利用职权介绍他一个根本不懂法律业务的朋友翻译“罗马法”，骗取稿费二千三百多元。有的人不仅向出版社骗取稿费，而且公然向著译者勒索，助理编辑程铭知道某译者在该社出版了书，就去勒索了二百元。另一个助理编辑王琪昌为了要下饭馆大吃一顿，就硬向一个在该社出书的译者勒索了四十元。试问这样的编辑部怎么能够编辑和出版质量高的书来？
    陈于彤以及其他一些编辑人员的生活，也是非常腐化堕落的。陈于彤为了尽情的吃、喝、玩、乐，可以在办公时间丢开工作不管，邀请出版社一些与他臭味相投的人去逛公园、蹓马路、跳舞和下饭馆。仅根据去年连续四个月的统计，陈于彤光因这些私事就乘了公家小汽车一百一十九次。在陈于彤的办公室里，经常可以听到麻将牌的响声，有时甚至打得废寝忘食，深夜不散。
    法律出版社的问题这样严重，直接领导这个出版社的司法部过去也并不是不知道。早在1956年就有人向司法部领导上反映过，但是，由于该部的少数领导同志对陈于彤的严重错误认识不足，所以只简单地批评一下。因此法律出版社的问题，不仅没有得到解决，而且更加严重起来，终于给党和国家造成了不可弥补的损失。整风终于像一声警钟一样敲醒了这些领导人，现在，当整风进入深入整改阶段以后，司法部直接领导着法律出版社，发动群众对这些严重的问题进行了深入认真的揭发和检查，从中找出严重教训，为全面改进这个出版社的工作作好准备；而且停止了陈于彤党内外的一切职务，令其检查反省，听候处理。这的确是司法部和法律出版社整风中的一大收获。
