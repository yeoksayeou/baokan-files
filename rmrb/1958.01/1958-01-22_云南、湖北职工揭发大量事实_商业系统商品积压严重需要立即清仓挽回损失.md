Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 21st: Yunnan Province's commercial system has revealed numerous shocking waste incidents during the voicing opinions and rectification and inspection.

	Judging from the revealed and inspected situations, the most prominent issue is that the commercial system, in its operations, does not study local conditions and the needs of producers and consumers, but blindly organizes sources of goods from other places, causing waste. The Provincial Trade Company purchased large quantities of bamboo chopsticks, wooden coat hangers, lampshades, and other commodities that could be produced locally from outside the province, which not only hit local production but also caused waste and losses. The Provincial Aquatic Products Company blindly transported hundreds of tons of dried and salted aquatic products that were not suitable for the needs of the local people. The Kunming City Company alone lost more than 200,000 yuan. The mountain roads are rugged, but the commercial departments transported bicycles, and without electricity, they transported electric hair curlers. In the shops selling ethnic goods, items like cigarette holders costing more than 20 yuan each, fans costing more than 7 yuan each, and theatrical Eight Immortals lanterns, etc., so-called ethnic goods, have been on display for a year with very few customers, while ethnic minorities need sheepskins and other commodities were out of stock.
	Irresponsible work styles and a lack of a thrifty enterprise-running mentality are also quite serious in commercial departments. The Provincial Trade Company transported maltose from Zhaotong to Kunming without proper packaging. As the trucks traveled along the road, the sugar water dripped along the way, wasting 240,000 yuan in transporting one million catties of sugar. Many commercial units suffered spoilage and deterioration of materials due to poor storage. Some units suffered losses of hundreds of thousands or even millions of yuan. In many areas, commercial departments also have long-term unclear inventories and chaotic property. The Binchuan County grassroots supply and marketing cooperative lost a large number of materials in farmers' homes, including radios, pig iron, brown sugar, and even draft cattle. Due to the huge waste and losses, more than 50% of the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in Yunnan Province have lost money.
	Now, all units have decided to make anti-waste an important part of the rectification stage, and have initially drafted improvement plans. Since November last year, the leaders of the thirteen units under the Commerce Department have personally taken the lead in cleaning and tidying up warehouses, salvaging moldy materials, and disposing of defective goods.
	(This newspaper Kunming 21st dispatch) Kunming Department Store has set off a high tide of anti-waste in the rectification. The staff revealed in the voicing of opinions that in 1956 alone, blindly organizing sources of goods caused the country a loss of nearly 100,000 yuan.
	In 1956, the supply of goods in the Kunming market appeared somewhat strained, so the City Department Store sent people to purchase goods everywhere. The standard was that as long as the money was spent, it didn't matter what goods were purchased. As a result, many commodities that were not within the company's business scope and were not needed by the market were also purchased. For example, they once bought more than 100,000 fishhooks, worth more than 4,200 yuan. Among the fishhooks were large hooks that could catch fish weighing more than 30 kilograms. There are not so many people fishing in Kunming, and there are no such large fish to catch. The existing ten imported accordions could not be sold, so they purchased another thirty-five 120-bass accordions costing more than 1,000 yuan each. Until now, they are still overstocked in the warehouse. The accumulated small light bulbs, calculated at two per person according to the local population, could be sold for several years. Even the razor blades that were already marked as rusty were bought, and as a result, they had to be piled up in the warehouse. There were also some high-priced commodities that they knew no one would buy, but they still bought them. For example, British cashmere overcoat fabric, costing 186 yuan per meter, was bought but no one asked about it. They also bought seventeen pieces of glassware, worth more than 6,900 yuan, a vase costing 185 yuan, and a fruit plate costing 205 yuan. According to the purchasing staff, buying these things was "to decorate the facade."
	In addition, the staff also revealed that some commodities were not urgently needed, but they were transported by plane, causing great waste. For example, children's firecrackers, costing 200 yuan, were transported from Chongqing by plane, costing 300 yuan in freight; insulated buckets that had been overstocked in the warehouse for a long time, shoulder pads and gloves that could be processed in Kunming were all transported by plane from other places.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 20th: During the rectification movement, the masses in the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and its subordinate units revealed many examples of wasting state property. For example, the supply and marketing cooperative purchased more than 40,000 boxes of mineral wax regardless of the actual needs of the rural market. Until before the launch of the rectification movement, more than half were still piled up in the warehouse and no one wanted them. Some of them had already melted and deformed, and could only be sold at a reduced price. This part of the loss, plus the interest paid for the overstocking for three years, was about 300,000 yuan. After Hubei Province suffered a major flood in 1954, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative went to purchase rapeseed all over the country. This was originally a good thing to support the people's production and disaster relief, but because they disregarded actual needs, disregarded costs, and blindly purchased, most of the rapeseed purchased could not be sold, so they had to lower the price and sell it to farmers as fertilizer, losing 500,000 yuan. There are more than 100 kinds of such long-term overstocked commodities, just in the production materials and daily miscellaneous goods management office, with a total value of over 1 million yuan.
	In addition to deciding that blind procurement must be prevented in the future, the leaders of the provincial supply and marketing cooperative units are doing everything possible to find a way out for the overstocked materials in order to avoid and reduce waste as much as possible. They have sent dozens of cadres to other provinces to sell more than 200,000 yuan of overstocked commodities.

    云南、湖北职工揭发大量事实
    商业系统商品积压严重需要立即清仓挽回损失
    据新华社昆明21日电　云南省商业系统在鸣放和整改检查中揭露出大量触目惊心的浪费事件。
    从揭发和检查出的情况来看，最为突出的是商业系统在经营上不研究当地的条件和生产者、消费者的需要，盲目向外地组织货源，造成浪费。省贸易公司到省外大量采购当地能生产的竹筷、木衣架、灯罩等商品，既打击了当地的生产，又造成浪费损失。省水产公司盲目运进几百吨不适合当地人民需要的干咸水产品，仅昆明市公司就损失二十多万元。山区道路崎岖，而商业部门却运去了自行车，没有电却运去了电烫发夹。在经营民族商品的门市部里，二十多元一枚的烟嘴、七元多一把的扇子以及舞台用的八仙灯笼等所谓民族商品，摆了一年都很少有人问津，而少数民族人民需要的羊皮等商品却又无货。
    不负责任的作风和缺乏勤俭办企业的思想，在商业部门也是相当严重的。省贸易公司从昭通运昆明的饴糖，不好好包装，汽车沿路走，糖水沿路淌，运一百万斤糖浪费了二十四万元。许多商业单位因保管不善，物资发霉变质，有的单位损失竟达几十万元以至百万元之多。许多地区的商业部门还长期家底不清，财产混乱。宾川县基层供销社丢散大批物资在农民家里，其中有收音机、毛铁、红糖甚至耕牛。由于各种浪费和损失巨大，云南省50％以上的基层供销社亏了本。
    现在各单位决定把反浪费作为整改阶段的重要内容，并已初步拟出改进方案。从去年11月以来，商业厅所属十三个单位的领导人，都亲自带头打扫和清理仓库，挽救霉变物资和处理残次商品。
    本报昆明21日电　昆明市百货公司在整改中掀起了一个反浪费的高潮。职工在鸣放中揭露，1956年仅盲目组织货源一项，就给国家造成近十万元的损失。
    1956年昆明市场商品供应显得有些紧张，市百货公司就派人员四出采购，标准是只要钱用出去就行，不管采购的是什么货。结果，很多不属公司经营和市场并不需要的商品也采购了。例如他们曾一次买进了十万多个钓鱼钩，价值四千二百多元，鱼钩中还有可钓三十公斤以上的鱼的大钩，昆明没有这么多人钓鱼，也根本没有这样的大鱼可钓。进口的手风琴原有的十架已卖不掉，又采购了每架千多元的一百二十贝司手风琴三十五架，直到现在，还积压在仓库里。积存的小电珠，按当地人口每人二个计算，可卖好几年。已经注明生锈的刀片，也买进来，结果只好堆在仓库里。还有一些价格高昂的商品，明知没人买，可是也买了进来。如英国开士米大衣呢，每公尺一百八十六元，买来了根本无人问津。他们还买了十七件玻璃器皿，值六千九百多元，一个花瓶值一百八十五元，一个果盘值二百零五元。据采办人员说：买这些东西是为了“用来装璜门面”。
    此外，职工们还揭发了有些商品不是急需的，也要用飞机运来，造成很大的浪费。如小孩玩的打火纸，成本二百元，由重庆用飞机运来，花了运费三百元；长期积压在仓库里的保温桶，在昆明可以加工的垫肩、手套等，也都是从外地用飞机运来的。
    据新华社武汉20日电　湖北省供销社和所属各单位在整风运动中，群众揭发出许多浪费国家资财的事例。例如供销社不顾农村市场实际需要购进四万多箱矿腊，一直到整风运动开展前还有一半多堆在仓库里没人要，其中有些已经溶化变形，只可能削价出售，这部分亏损加上三年来因积压而支付的利息就在三十万元左右。1954年湖北省遭到特大洪水后，省供销社曾到全国各地去采购菜籽，这本来是支援人民生产救灾的好事，但由于他们不顾实际需要，不计成本，盲目采购，因此，购回的大部分菜籽推销不掉，只好降价卖给农民作肥料，亏损了五十万元。这样长期积压的商品，仅生产资料日用杂品一个管理处就有一百多种，积压总值在一百万元以上。
    省供销社各单位领导人除了决定今后必须防止盲目采购以外，正在千方百计地为积压的物资寻求出路，以尽量避免和减少浪费。他们已派出了几十个干部到外省去，推销了二十多万元的积压商品。
