Rapid Development of Czechoslovakian Library Services

The Czechoslovakian People's Library, inheriting national traditions, has achieved tremendous development in the era of the people's government.

In Czechoslovakia, the People's Library is a vast mass educational institution. There are now approximately 14,000 People's Libraries throughout the country, widely distributed in all corners, forming a unified library network. Every village has a library. Each district has a district library, and each state capital has established a state library. District and state libraries are the centers of library services in their respective districts and states, guiding the work of local libraries and answering difficult questions.

In addition to fixed libraries, there is also a mobile library – the bookmobile. The work of the mobile library is not limited to lending books, but also includes extensive educational activities such as broadcasting radio programs, showing slides, and performing puppet shows (the mobile library is equipped with radio equipment, slide projectors, and puppet shows). This type of library is most popular with people in rural and remote areas.

The number of books in the People's Libraries is constantly increasing, and the number of users is expanding. From 1946 to 1956, the number of books increased by 1.3 times, and the number of readers increased by 1.24 times. The total number of books in the People's Libraries is nearly 18 million. Another 800,000 to 1 million books are added each year. Currently, twelve out of every hundred residents are readers of the People's Libraries.

    捷克斯洛伐克
    图书馆事业迅速发展
    继承了民族传统的捷克斯洛伐克人民图书馆，在人民政权的年代里获得了巨大的发展。
    在捷克斯洛伐克，人民图书馆是巨大的群众性的教育机构。现在全国共有约一万四千个人民图书馆，广泛地分布在各个角落里，组成了统一的图书馆网。每个村庄都有图书馆。每个区有区立图书馆，每一个州的首府都建立了州立图书馆。区立和州立图书馆是全区和全州图书馆事业的中心，它们指导所属地方图书馆的工作，解答疑难。
    除了固定图书馆以外，还有一种流动图书馆——图书汽车。流动图书馆的工作，不仅限于借书，同时还展开广泛的教育活动，如播送广播节目、放映幻灯片以及演木偶戏等（流动图书馆装有无线电装置、幻灯设备和木偶戏）。这种图书馆最受农村和边远地区的人民欢迎。
    人民图书馆藏书册数不断增加，服务对象不断扩大。从1946年到1956年，藏书册数增加了一点三倍，读者人数增加了一点二四倍。人民图书馆藏书总数近一千八百万册。每年还要增加八十万到一百万册图书。现在每一百个居民中就有十二个是人民图书馆的读者。
