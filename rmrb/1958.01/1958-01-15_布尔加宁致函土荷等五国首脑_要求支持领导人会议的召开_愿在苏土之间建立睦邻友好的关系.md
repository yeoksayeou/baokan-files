Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 14th: According to TASS, Moscow, January 14th: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, has written letters to the heads of government of Turkey, the Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, and Afghanistan respectively.

　　These letters were delivered by the Soviet ambassadors to these countries respectively. Attached to the letters were the "Proposals of the Soviet Government on the Question of Easing International Tension."

　　In his letter to Turkish Prime Minister Menderes, Bulganin said that for many years, the Soviet government has been continuously committed to easing international tension. However, the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council showed that the governments of certain countries are very unwilling to accept the demand of the people of all countries for negotiations between countries on important international issues. The governments of these countries only verbally guarantee that they are willing to have peace, but in reality, they continue to advocate an arms race, including atomic and hydrogen weapons, with more strength.

　　The letter expressed regret and disappointment that Turkey is also adopting this attitude. Bulganin said that Turkey has revealed intentions that the Soviet Union cannot understand. On the issue of setting up foreign nuclear weapons and rocket weapons on its territory, it wants to be ahead of other countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This can only be explained as: in Turkey, it seems that not everyone understands the true meaning of this dangerous measure.

　　Bulganin then pointed out that Turkey has no reason to be alarmed about the prospects of easing international tension and consolidating peace in the Middle East. On the contrary, it is the termination of the Cold War, the cessation of the arms race, and the strengthening of Turkey's friendly relations with its neighboring countries that can guarantee that the Turkish people can have a bright future full of confidence.

　　Bulganin pointed out that the only wish of the Soviet government is to establish genuine good-neighborly, friendly, mutually understanding, and mutually trusting relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey.

　　In his letter to Dutch Prime Minister Drees, Bulganin pointed out that the people of all countries in the world are increasingly resolutely demanding that governments eliminate the "Cold War," stop war propaganda and the arms race, and establish normal conditions for people to live and work in peace. For the benefit of all countries, large and small, the current situation requires urgent measures to prevent events from developing in a dangerous direction.

　　Bulganin pointed out that the proposition of negotiations has received widespread support in the Netherlands. The Soviet working people are pleased to learn that an influential political party in the Netherlands, the Labor Party, advocates banning the testing of atomic weapons.

　　In the letter, Bulganin hoped that the Dutch Prime Minister and the Dutch government would understand and support the Soviet government's proposals.

　　In his letter to Swedish Prime Minister Erlander, Bulganin pointed out that the proposition of holding negotiations between leaders of Eastern and Western countries has gained increasing recognition in many countries, including Sweden. The Soviet government, in its consistent struggle for peace and the security of all peoples, has always emphasized the importance of negotiations.

　　The letter emphasized that the Soviet government believes that it is appropriate for many countries that do not participate in military blocs and pursue a neutral policy, thereby making very significant contributions to easing international tension and consolidating the cause of peace, to participate in a conference of national leaders.

　　Bulganin wrote in the letter that Sweden has pursued a policy of neutrality for many years, which has made a certain contribution to the cause of peace, especially to the cause of peace in Northern Europe. Bulganin hopes that the Soviet government's proposal to convene a conference of national leaders will be approved and supported by the Swedish government.

　　In his letter to Austrian Chancellor Raab, Bulganin said, we believe that neutral Austria is located in the center of Europe between two groups of countries, and for this reason alone, it cannot but express concern for maintaining peace. Therefore, Austria's participation in the conference of national leaders proposed by the Soviet Union may make a significant contribution to easing international tension and restoring international trust.

　　Bulganin said that he was very pleased with the speech made by Raab on January 5 this year. In his speech, Raab said that in the first half of 1958, it would be appropriate for leaders of Eastern and Western countries to hold negotiations on maintaining lasting peace, and that Austria would gladly participate in such negotiations.

　　The letter said that your speech gives rise to the hope that the Austrian government will study the Soviet government's proposals with due attention, will treat the participation in the conference of national leaders proposed by the Soviet Union with sincerity, and will promote the convening and success of this conference.

　　In his letter to Afghan Prime Minister Daud, Bulganin pointed out that the Soviet government has put forward a proposal to the heads of government of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to convene a conference of relevant national leaders within the next two or three months to discuss urgent international issues. At the same time, the Soviet government also suggested that, in addition to the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the member states of the Warsaw Treaty, countries such as Afghanistan, India, Egypt, Yugoslavia, Sweden, and Austria, which are not bound by the obligations of the above-mentioned groups, can also participate in this conference.

　　Bulganin pointed out that the Soviet proposal is in many respects in line with the principles put forward by the Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries. Bulganin then wrote in the letter: The Soviet government knows that the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan is wholeheartedly committed to maintaining and consolidating the cause of peace, understands that it consistently pursues a policy of neutrality and non-participation in military blocs, and is well aware that you, Mr. Prime Minister, care about the fate of the world. Therefore, it hopes that the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan can treat the Soviet proposal well.

    布尔加宁致函土荷等五国首脑
    要求支持领导人会议的召开
    愿在苏土之间建立睦邻友好的关系
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁分别给土耳其、荷兰、瑞典、奥地利和阿富汗政府首脑写了信。
    这几封信是由苏联驻这些国家的大使分别递交的。信中附有“苏联政府关于缓和国际紧张局势问题的建议”。
    布尔加宁在给土耳其总理曼德列斯的信中说，多年以来，苏联政府一直毫不间断地致力于缓和国际紧张局势。但是，北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议表明，某些国家的政府是很不愿意接受各国人民对各国之间就重要国际问题举行谈判的要求的。这些国家的政府只是在口头上保证它们愿意和平，但实际上却继续主张用更多的力量来进行包括原子武器和氢武器在内的军备竞赛。
    信中对土耳其也是采取这种态度的国家这一点表示遗憾和失望。布尔加宁说，土耳其表露出苏联所不能理解的意图，在有关在自己的领土上设置外国的核武器和火箭武器的问题上，它想走在北大西洋公约组织其他国家的前头。这只能这样来解释：在土耳其，看来并不是所有的人都明白这种危险措施的真正意义。
    布尔加宁接着指出，土耳其没有任何理由对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固中近东和平的前途感到惊惶不安。恰恰相反，正是终止冷战、停止军备竞赛和加强土耳其同它的邻国的友好关系，才能保证土耳其人民能够有令人充满信心的、光明的前途。
    布尔加宁指出，苏联政府的唯一愿望，是在苏土之间建立真正的睦邻、友好、相互谅解和相互信任的关系。
    布尔加宁在给荷兰首相德里斯的信中指出，世界各国人民日益坚决地要求政府消除“冷战”，停止战争宣传和军备竞赛，为人们的安居乐业建立正常条件。为了所有大小国家的利益，目前的局势要求采取紧急措施，防止事件朝危险的方向发展。
    布尔加宁指出，谈判的主张在荷兰得到了广泛的支持。苏联劳动人民满意地得悉，荷兰一个有影响的政党——劳工党主张禁止试验原子武器。
    布尔加宁在信中希望，荷兰首相和荷兰政府会理解和支持苏联政府的建议。
    在致瑞典首相埃兰德的信中，布尔加宁指出，东西方国家领导人举行谈判的主张在包括瑞典在内的许多国家中获得愈来愈广泛的承认，苏联政府在争取和平和各国人民安全的始终不渝的斗争中，总是强调指出谈判的重要意义。
    这封信强调指出，苏联政府认为，有不参加军事集团、执行中立政策、从而对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的事业作出非常重大的贡献的许多国家参加各国国家领导人会议是适宜的。
    布尔加宁在信中写道，瑞典多年来奉行中立政策，这对和平事业、特别是对北欧的和平事业有一定的贡献。布尔加宁希望苏联政府关于召开各国领导人会议的建议会得到瑞典政府的赞同和支持。
    布尔加宁在给奥地利总理拉布的信中说，我们认为，中立的奥地利位于欧洲中部两个国家集团之间，单是由于这一点，它对维护和平就不能不表示关心了。所以，奥地利参加苏联建议召开的各国领导人会议，可能会对缓和国际紧张局势和恢复国际信任做出重大的贡献。
    布尔加宁说，他对拉布在今年1月5日发表的演说感到非常满意。拉布在演说中曾说，在1958年上半年，东西方各国领导人就维护持久和平问题举行谈判是适当的，并说奥地利将欣然参加这种谈判。
    信中说，你的这篇演说使人们产生这样的希望：奥地利政府将以应有的注意来研究苏联政府的建议，将以诚意来对待参加苏联建议召开的各国领导人会议，并将促进这次会议的召开和成功。
    布尔加宁在给阿富汗首相达乌德的信中指出，苏联政府向北大西洋集团成员国政府首脑提出了在最近两三个月内召开有关国家领导人会议来讨论迫切的国际问题的建议，同时，苏联政府还建议，除了北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约成员国以外，像阿富汗、印度、埃及、南斯拉夫、瑞典、奥地利这样一些不受上述集团义务约束的国家也可以参加这次会议。
    布尔加宁指出，苏联的建议在很多方面符合于亚非国家万隆会议提出的原则。布尔加宁接着在信中写道：苏联政府知道阿富汗王国政府一心致力于维护和巩固和平事业，了解它始终不渝地奉行中立和不参加军事集团的政策，而且深知您，首相先生，关怀世界命运，因此，希望阿富汗王国政府能很好地对待苏联的建议。
