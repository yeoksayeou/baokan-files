Comrades and Friends:

The Baoji-Chengdu Railway, which has drawn the attention of the entire nation, is officially open to traffic today. This is another great victory in our country's socialist construction. We warmly congratulate the victorious completion of this arduous project and the official opening of the entire line.

The Baoji-Chengdu Railway is a transportation hub for several provinces in the Northwest and Southwest. It is not only a necessary transportation artery for the country to establish industrial bases in the Northwest and Southwest in the future, but also a major event that affects the economic life of more than 100 million people in the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan. For a long time, the people of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces have hoped to realize the ideal of building this railway. I remember that in the past, the people of Sichuan waged bloody struggles to build the railway. Until now, the Xinhai Autumn Railway Protection Martyr Monument is still preserved in the People's Park in Chengdu. However, in the forty years after the Xinhai Revolution, Sichuan had not seen a trace of the railway. Since the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to win the victory of the national revolution, the situation has been very different. Only two years after the liberation of the Southwest, on July 1, 1952, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was first opened to traffic. At the time of the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, Chairman Mao issued the call to "continue to work hard to build the Tiandi Railway". In less than five years, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was built and officially opened to traffic today. It is conceivable that it is not surprising that the people of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces celebrated the opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway as a major happy event.

The Baoji-Chengdu Railway runs through dangerous mountains and deep waters, with complex geological conditions, deep and long tunnels, and many bridges. It is an extremely difficult project in China's railway construction. The completion of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway demonstrates the great achievements of the Chinese people in overcoming nature under the leadership of the Communist Party, and also proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist political and economic system. The completion of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway once again smashed the rightists' slander of denying China's socialist construction achievements with ironclad facts.

The successful completion of the great Baoji-Chengdu Railway project is the result of the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the arduous and heroic struggle of all railway engineering and technical personnel and workers, the cooperation and support of relevant departments and regions across the country, and the support of the party and government leading organs of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces and the broad masses of people along the railway. With the experience of building the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, we will definitely be able to build more, faster, better, and more economically other railways in any mountainous area of the country.

The completion of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has received enthusiastic and selfless assistance from the Soviet government and Soviet experts. During the construction of the railway, Soviet railway technical experts frequently went to the construction site to provide specific guidance, put forward many valuable suggestions, and helped solve many major problems in the construction process, which played a significant role in ensuring project quality and saving national investment.

I now represent the State Council to congratulate all engineering and technical personnel and workers who built the Baoji-Chengdu Railway! Thank you for your spirit of arduous struggle and overcoming difficulties; I congratulate all the workers of all localities and departments who actively supported the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway! Congratulations to the people along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway! Thank you for your multifaceted support. I also represent the State Council to congratulate all Soviet experts who participated in the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and made outstanding contributions with selfless labor! Thank you for your selfless brotherly help.

We are honored that all the distinguished guests of the Myanmar Good-Will Economic Study Group, headed by Myanmar Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein, also attended our opening ceremony today. We feel that this is an encouragement to the peaceful construction cause of our people. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Myanmar government and people for their friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. May the friendly exchanges between China and Myanmar be as smooth and unimpeded as the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

### 在宝成铁路通车典礼大会上  贺龙副总理的讲话

    在宝成铁路通车典礼大会上
    贺龙副总理的讲话同志们、朋友们：
    全国瞩目的宝成铁路，今天正式通车了。这是我国社会主义建设事业的又一次伟大的胜利，我们热烈祝贺这一艰巨工程的胜利完成和全线正式通车。
    宝成铁路是西北西南几省的交通枢纽。它不仅是国家今后在西北西南地区建立工业基地必需的运输干线，也是关联着陕甘川三省一亿以上人民经济生活的重大事件。陕甘川三省的人民长时期以来，就希望实现修建这条铁路的理想。记得过去四川人民为了修建铁路曾经进行过流血的斗争，直到现在，辛亥秋保路死事纪念碑还保留在成都的人民公园里面。但是辛亥革命以后的四十年，四川并没有见到过铁路的影子。自从中国共产党领导中国人民取得了全国革命的胜利以后，情形就大不相同了。西南解放仅仅两年多，在1952年的7月1日，成渝铁路首先通车了。就在成渝铁路通车的时候，毛主席发出了“继续努力修筑天成路”的号召，仅仅在还不到五年的时间内，紧接着又把宝成铁路修通，并且在今天正式通车了。可以设想，陕甘川三省人民把宝成路通车当作一件大喜事来祝贺，并不是奇怪的。
    宝成铁路沿途山险水深，地质复杂，隧道深长，桥梁甚多，是我国铁路建筑事业中一项极其艰巨的工程。宝成铁路的建成，显示出我国人民在共产党领导下战胜自然的巨大成就，也证明了社会主义的政治制度和经济制度具有无比的优越性。宝成铁路的建成，再一次用铁的事实粉碎了右派分子否定我国社会主义建设成就的谰言。
    伟大宝成铁路工程的胜利完成，是在中国共产党的领导之下，依靠全体铁路工程技术人员和职工同志们备尝艰苦、英勇奋斗，依靠全国有关各部门、各地区的配合和支援，依靠陕西、甘肃、四川三省党政领导机关和铁路沿线广大人民群众的支援的结果。有了建筑宝成铁路的经验，我们就一定能够在全国山峦纵横的任何地区，更多更快更好更省地建设起其他铁路。
    宝成铁路的建成，得到苏联政府和苏联专家们热情的无私的帮助。在铁路的修建过程中，先后有苏联铁路技术专家，经常到工地作具体指导，提出了许多宝贵的建议，帮助解决了修建过程中许多重大问题，这对于保证工程质量、节省国家投资，都起了重大的作用。
    我现在代表国务院向建筑宝成铁路的全体工程技术人员和职工同志们祝贺！感谢你们艰苦奋斗、克服困难的英勇精神；向积极支援宝成铁路建设的各地方各部门的全体职工祝贺！向宝成路沿线的人民群众祝贺！感谢你们多方面的支援。我还代表国务院向参加宝成路建设，以忘我劳动作出卓越贡献的全体苏联专家同志们祝贺！感谢你们无私的兄弟般的帮助。
    使我们引为荣幸的是：以缅甸副总理吴觉迎为首的缅甸友好经济考察团的全体贵宾们，今天也参加了我们的通车典礼，我们感觉这是贵宾们对我国人民的和平建设事业的一种鼓励。我愿借此机会感谢缅甸政府和人民对我国人民的这种友好情谊。愿中缅两国的友好往来，如宝成铁路一样的永远畅通无阻。
