Why is it said that "the more you shrink, the colder you get"?

In winter, the temperature is low, and our body needs to produce more "heat" to resist the cold from the outside world.

The ways the body produces heat are these: Take in more food, speed up digestion and metabolism to provide more "fuel"; increase muscle activity, such as running, jumping, rubbing hands, and even shivering all over, which can make the human body produce more heat.

If you are afraid of the cold, shrink into a ball, and dare not move, that is to say, your muscles are not working, and of course there will be less "heat", so it will be "the more you shrink, the colder you get." This is also why lying down is colder than sitting, sitting is colder than standing, and standing is colder than walking.

### 为什么说“越缩越冷”？

    为什么说“越缩越冷”？
    冬天气温低，我们的身体就需要多产“热”，来抵御外界的寒冷。
    身体产热的方式是这些：多摄取食物，加紧消化和新陈代谢，以便供给更多的“燃料”；增加肌肉的活动，比如跑跑跳跳、搓搓手、甚至混身抖索等，这全能使人体产生更多的热。
    如果你怕冷，缩作一团，动也不敢动，这就是说，你的肌肉没有作工，“热”当然会少些，所以会“越缩越冷”。这也是为什么躺着比坐着冷，坐着比站着冷，站着又比走路冷的原因。
