Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 27th: Cairo newspapers reported on January 27th that the Algerian National Liberation Front issued a statement warning France not to carry out the death sentence against Algerian nationalist young woman Djamila Bouhired.

The statement said that everyone understands, and even the French themselves understand, that this young woman is innocent. The French authorities cannot produce any evidence of her guilt, except for the "confession" that the French forced out of her under torture until she became mentally disturbed.

The National Liberation Front appealed to the world to stop France's sentencing of an innocent person, and warned that if the sentence is carried out, France will be fully responsible for the consequences of this atrocity.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 27th: "Al Messa" called on the Egyptian people on the 27th to join the people all over the world in saving Djamila Bouhired, the Algerian patriotic young woman who was sentenced to death by the French colonialists.

The newspaper asked its readers to sign an appeal to the United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld. The appeal expressed strong protest against the French colonialists' death sentence against this Algerian patriotic young woman, and demanded that the UN Secretary-General immediately intervene in "this brutal crime that aroused the anger of people all over the world."

The appeal also demanded that those responsible for torturing Bouhired be brought to justice.
