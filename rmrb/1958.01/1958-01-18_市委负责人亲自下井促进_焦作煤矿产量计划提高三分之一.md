Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 16th: Jiaozuo Coal Mine workers, with a spirit of great leap forward, revised this year's production plan, increasing output by more than 31% compared to the original plan, preparing to produce an extra 750,000 tons of coal for the country.

This new annual production plan was formulated after leaders of the Jiaozuo Municipal Party Committee recently went deep into the various mine shafts of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine, repeatedly propagandizing the current situation and tasks to the workers, and specifically helping the enterprise's leading cadres through comprehensive investigation and detailed accounting.

Chen Xiajun, Deputy Secretary of the Jiaozuo Municipal Party Committee, personally organized workers in the Wangfeng and Lifeng mines to study relevant documents, launching a wave of criticism against right-leaning conservative thought. In just four days, these two mines posted more than 1,300 big-character posters, raising more than 4,000 opinions, sharply criticizing some leaders who believed that the two old mines had little coal, much gas, high water inflow, and inconvenient transportation, and that the original plan to produce 1.7 million tons of coal for the whole year was already advanced. He also helped leading cadres solve seventeen major problems, thereby prompting Wangfeng Mine to change from the original plan of producing 1.1 million tons of coal to producing 1.3 million tons, and Lifeng Mine to increase from 600,000 tons to 800,000 tons.

The Xiaomacun Mine, which was only completed and put into production in October 1956 with an annual output of 300,000 tons of coal, and the newly restored No. 39 well with an annual output of 300,000 tons, originally planned to reach the designed output this year. However, after Zhang Chao, Secretary of the Jiaozuo Municipal Party Committee, conducted a comprehensive survey of these two mines, he believed that the output of both mines could be increased to 400,000 tons this year.

The负责人 of the Beizhucun Mine, a pair of mines under construction with an annual output of 600,000 tons, originally believed that they would do their best to hand over production in September, and there would only be one working face, and only 50,000 tons of coal could be produced by the end of the year. Later, when Zhang Zhong, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, helped them mobilize workers to discuss this plan at the construction site, the workers put forward many measures and suggestions to improve the planned targets. According to the plan revised based on the workers' opinions, this pair of mines will be put into production in July this year ahead of schedule, and three working faces can be opened up, and 200,000 to 250,000 tons of coal can be produced by the end of the year.

### 市委负责人亲自下井促进  焦作煤矿产量计划提高三分之一

    市委负责人亲自下井促进
    焦作煤矿产量计划提高三分之一
    新华社郑州16日电　焦作煤矿职工以跃进的精神修订了今年的生产计划，使产量比原计划提高31％以上，准备为国家多生产七十五万吨煤炭。
    这个新的年度生产计划，是中共焦作市委负责人最近分别深入到焦作煤矿的各个矿井，向职工反复宣传了当前形势和任务，并且具体帮助企业的领导干部通过全面摸底和详细算账以后订出的。
    中共焦作市委副书记陈侠君在王封和李封两矿，亲自组织职工学习了有关文件，发动全体职工掀起了一个关于反对右倾保守思想的鸣放热潮。仅四天时间，这两个矿就贴出大字报一千三百多张，提出意见四千多条，尖锐地批评了有些领导人认为两个老矿煤少、瓦斯大、涌水多、运输不便，原计划全年生产一百七十万吨煤已经是先进的了的保守思想，并且帮助领导干部解决了十七项重大问题，从而促使王封矿由原计划产一百一十万吨煤改为产一百三十万吨；李封矿由六十万吨提高到八十万吨。
    1956年10月才建成投入生产的年产三十万吨煤的小马村矿井和新恢复的年产三十万吨的三十九号井，今年原计划是达到设计的产量。但是中共焦作市委书记张超深入到这两个矿进行全面摸底以后，认为两个矿今年的产量都可以提高到四十万吨。
    正在建设中的一对年产六十万吨的北朱村矿井的负责人，原来认为自己尽最大努力，到9月间才能移交生产，而且还只有一个工作面，到年底只能生产五万吨煤，后来中共市委副书记张重在工地帮助他们发动职工讨论这个计划的时候，工人提出了很多提高计划指标的措施和建议。现在根据职工意见修订的计划，这对矿井将提前在今年7月间投入生产，而且还能够开拓出三个工作面，到年底可以生产二十到二十五万吨煤。
