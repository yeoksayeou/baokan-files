    The Man Who Doesn't Want Gold
  　Feng Hanxiang, Peking University
    The news of a poor peasant, Shang Dongtai, donating a gold brick weighing fifteen and a half jin to the state, which appeared on the second page of the People's Daily on December 30, 1957, caused me to think deeply for a long time.
    This gold brick was picked up by his younger brother, Shang Shuzhen, while digging air-raid shelters for the Japanese. As soon as gold is mentioned, people immediately think of its preciousness. If Shang Dongtai kept it, it would be enough for his family to live on for decades. But Shang Dongtai donated it to the state to invest in the construction of rural water conservancy projects.
    What power prompted him to take such action? Is it "returning lost property" or general moral character? No, because what he picked up, although gold, did not belong to anyone. No one would come looking for it, and no one would claim it if a notice was posted. The only explanation is the change in farmers' ideology and the improvement of socialist consciousness. In my opinion, Shang Dongtai must have seen that a gold brick is not enough to guarantee his happiness for a lifetime; but a good agricultural cooperative can bring endless happiness for generations. Moreover, this can also enable more people to live a happy and joyful new life. Compared with those "writers" who struggle day and night for a 30,000 yuan deposit, the difference is a hundred thousand miles!

    不要黄金的人
  　北京大学　酆汉湘
    1957年12月30日的人民日报第二版上，登了一条贫农尚东太把一块十五斤半重的金砖献给国家的消息，引起了我长久的深思。
    这块金砖是他弟弟尚书珍在替日本人挖防空洞时拣到的。一提到金子，人们立刻就会想到它的贵重，尚东太如果把它留下，满够一家几十年的用度了，但是尚东太把它献给国家，投资建设农村水利事业。
    是什么力量促使他作出这样的举动呢，是“拾金不昧”、一般做人的品德吗？不是，因为他拾的虽然是金，却不是哪个人的，没有人会来找，招领也没人会来取。唯一的解释是：农民思想意识的变化、社会主义觉悟的提高。我以为，尚东太一定看到一块金砖并不足以保障他一辈子的幸福；而一个好的农业合作社，却可以使得世世幸福无穷。何况这样还可使更多的人也都能过幸福欢乐的新生活。这和那些日夜为三万元存款奋斗的“作家”比起来，相差竟是十万八千里！
