    Why do chickens eat small stones?
    When chickens forage for food, they often swallow small stones in addition to eating feed. If you kill a chicken, you can find many small stones in its digestive tract. Why does it eat stones? Because chickens don't have teeth, they swallow food whole. To make food easier to digest, they eat some small stones at the same time as they eat food. In the digestive tract (gizzard), the hard small stones grind the food like a millstone. In addition, small stones often contain calcium, which can be partially absorbed after swallowing, which is helpful for their bone growth and eggshell formation. Undigested small stones will eventually be excreted from the body with the feces. Other grain-eating birds also have the habit of swallowing small stones. (Jiéfēng)

    鸡为什么要吃些小石子？
    鸡觅食时，除了吃饲料外，还常常吞食一些小石子。如果把鸡杀掉以后，在它的消化道里也可发现有很多小石子。它为什么要吃石子呢？因为鸡没有牙齿，吃东西是整个地吞下去的。为了使食物便于消化，所以它们在吃食物的同时，也吃些小石子。在消化道（肌胃）中，坚硬的小石子就会像磨盘一样地把食物磨碎。此外，小石子还常常含有钙质（石灰质），吞食后可以部分地被吸收，这对于它们的骨胳的成长和蛋壳的形成也有帮助。未被消化的小石子，最后将随粪便一起排出体外。其他的谷食性鸟类，也大都有吞食小石子的习惯。		（碣峰）
