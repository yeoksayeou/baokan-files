    Why Isn't a Jin of Wool Sixteen Liang?
    I am a purchasing agent at the Beijing Department Store Wholesale Company.
    One Sunday afternoon, I was walking around in the Department Store and saw a customer take out three skeins of sky-blue wool from his bag. He said to the sales clerk with a serious expression, "Comrade, take a look! This wool you're selling doesn't have enough weight. I weighed it at home, and this one and a half jin of wool is only one jin and six liang, short two liang." The sales clerk replied kindly, "Comrade, wool has a moisture content..." The customer said with dissatisfaction, "I don't understand what moisture content is. Buying one jin should mean getting sixteen liang. Nowadays, everything you buy is weighed fairly and measured accurately, so why doesn't the state-owned company sell wool with the proper weight? I'm going to write a letter to the People's Daily."
    Why doesn't wool have enough weight?
    Wool is spun from sheep's wool. Sheep's wool is very absorbent. The moisture contained in the wool is called moisture content. The Central Ministry of Textile Industry stipulates that the moisture content of wool is 15%. This means that every hundred jin of spun wool, after being dried in a drying room, only weighs eighty-five jin. However, when you take eighty-five jin of wool out of the drying room, it quickly absorbs moisture and the wool weighs a hundred jin again.
    The Ministry of Textile Industry has stipulated a moisture content of 15% for wool based on the general climatic conditions in our country. However, because our country is large and the climate varies from north to south, and the seasons change greatly, the phenomenon of underweight and overweight occurs. Taking Beijing's climate as an example: in April and September, the climate is neither humid nor dry, and in these two months, one jin of wool is exactly sixteen liang. In May, June, and July, it often rains and the climate is humid, so the moisture content of the wool exceeds 15%, and one jin of wool often exceeds sixteen liang. In November, December, and January, the weather is windy and the climate is dry, so the moisture content of the wool is less than 15%, and the wool becomes underweight. During this season, if wool from the same factory is transported to Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, and other regions, the underweight will be even greater. If it is transported to Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces, not only will it not be underweight, but it may even be overweight. These changes are all caused by the different degrees of dryness and humidity of the climate.
    Finally, I would also like to tell consumers that 100# Gongnong brand wool, one large skein is half a jin, composed of four small skeins, each small skein has sixty-two rounds, and each round is one hundred and eighty-six centimeters long. 100# Heping brand wool, each small skein has seventy rounds, and the round length is one hundred and eighty-four centimeters. 300# Qiyang brand wool, each large skein is four liang, also composed of four small skeins, each small skein has eighty rounds, and the round length is one hundred and seventy-three centimeters. As long as you buy original skeins of wool, there will be no problem with the weight. (Xu Yongnian)

### 一斤毛线为什么不够十六两？

    一斤毛线为什么不够十六两？
    我是北京市百货批发公司的采购员。
    一个星期天的下午，我在百货大楼里转，看到有位顾客从书包里掏出三大绞天蓝色毛线来，脸色很严肃地对售货员说：“同志，你看看吧！你们这毛线不够分量。我回家称了称，这一斤半毛线就够一斤六两，亏二两”。售货员很和蔼地回答说：“同志，毛线有含潮率……。”这位顾客很不满地说：“我不懂什么叫含潮率，买一斤就应该给十六两。现在买什么东西都是秤平、尺足，为什么国营公司卖的毛线不给够分量？我非给人民日报写信不可。”
    毛线为什么不够分量呢？
    毛线是用羊毛纺成的。羊毛的吸水性很强。毛线所含的水分，就叫做含潮率。中央纺织工业部规定，毛线含潮率为15％。这就是说每百斤纺出的毛线，经过烘干室烘干后，只够八十五斤了。但是，从烘干室里取出八十五斤毛线，很快就吸进水分，毛线又够一百斤重了。
    纺织工业部根据我国气候的一般条件，规定毛线含潮率为15％。但是由于我国地大，南北气候不同，季节变化也很大，因此就出现了亏重和超重的现象。拿北京的气候来说：4月和9月气候既不潮湿又不干燥，在这两个月里，一斤毛线正好是十六市两；到5、6、7月份，天经常下雨，气候潮湿，毛线的含潮率就超过了15％，一市斤毛线往往超过十六两；在11、12、1月份，天气多风，气候干燥，毛线含潮率就不到15％啦，毛线就产生亏重现象。在这个季节里，把同一个厂子出品的毛线运到内蒙古、黑龙江、新疆等地区，亏重还要多一些；要是运到江西、浙江、福建等省，不但不亏重，甚至还有超重的可能。这些变化都是由于气候干湿程度不同所引起的。
    最后，我还要告诉消费者，一百号工农牌毛线，一大绞是半市斤，由四小绞组成，每小绞是六十二圈，每圈长度一百八十六公分。一百号和平牌毛线，每小绞是七十圈，圈长是一百八十四公分。三百号奇羊牌毛线每大绞是四市两，也是由四小绞组成，每小绞是八十圈，圈长是一百七十三公分。只要您买的是原绞毛线，在分量上就不会有问题。（许永年）
