Xinhua News Agency dispatches: The proposal put forward by the Soviet Union to hold an East-West summit meeting remains the focus of international public opinion. The movement calling for an early summit meeting is continuing to unfold widely and deeply in various countries.

Khrushchev's speech in Minsk on the 22nd regarding the international situation has further promoted the wave calling for a summit meeting. This speech has received widespread attention from the press in various countries.

German newspapers attach great importance to Khrushchev's propositions on the German question and his comments on Adenauer's reply to Bulganin's letter.

Many German newspapers expressed satisfaction with Khrushchev's repeated proposal to resolve disputes through a meeting of heads of government from various countries.

The West German "Parliamentary Political News Bulletin" reported that the head of the Social Democratic Party's press office, Herr Hai, advocated "carefully studying" Khrushchev's suggestions on German reunification. Hai demanded that the West German government no longer give negative replies to the Soviet Union's various suggestions on the German question, but rather propose plans and suggestions for a unified Germany.

"Neue Rhein Zeitung" wrote that Khrushchev's statements on a nuclear-weapon-free zone and a European collective security treaty showed how much the Soviet Union "cares about easing tensions in Europe." The newspaper emphasized that this attitude of the Soviet Union is also conducive to resolving the German question.

Many newspapers in Paris reported in detail on Khrushchev's speech and emphasized that the Soviet government considers it important to hold an East-West summit meeting to quickly resolve pressing international issues.

"L'Echo" commented on Khrushchev's speech, saying, "In today's conditions, the only way out is to stop the arms race and war, and to arrange reconciliation through negotiations."

According to Agence France-Presse, diplomatic figures in the French capital believe that Khrushchev's speech deserves extremely careful study.

British Labour Party MPs again demanded in the House of Commons on the 28th that the government take concrete steps to organize an East-West summit meeting to resolve outstanding international issues.

Labour MP Lewis asked the government when it would agree to hold a high-level meeting. He pointed out that there has been no progress in this regard so far. Labour leader Gaitskell demanded that the government explicitly declare its support for holding a summit meeting.

Acting Prime Minister Butler attempted to evade these questions, saying that these questions could only be answered after the government had replied to the letter from Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin on January 8.

The former Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs said on the evening of the 27th that Western countries should "take the initiative" to negotiate with the Soviet Union to achieve world peace.

He said that "strength" is only a "short-term force," and "negotiation is the only path leading to world peace." He believes that negotiations are "as important as missiles and rockets."

Faced with strong public pressure, the governments of Western countries have had to take evasive measures. French Foreign Minister Pineau reiterated in a television interview on the 27th that a meeting of foreign ministers should be held before the East-West summit meeting to draft the agenda. He said that convening a meeting of foreign ministers that "only determines the agenda but does not discuss the issues themselves" "may be the most practical and quickest way to the East-West summit meeting."

In his speech, Pineau said that the only obstacle to holding an East-West summit meeting at present is the question of determining the agenda. He said that this issue should be "easy to resolve." Pineau believes that the agenda of the summit meeting may include issues such as disarmament, German reunification, and aid to underdeveloped countries. He also advocated only allowing countries directly related to the agenda to participate in the meeting.

However, the US government still insists on a die-hard stance and refuses to take a step forward. US State Department spokesman White reiterated on the 28th that the United States refuses to hold an East-West summit meeting soon.

White made the remarks while commenting on Khrushchev's speech in Minsk on the 22nd, which shows that the United States still insists on obstructing and delaying the convening of such a meeting. Khrushchev had pointed out that the necessity of holding an East-West summit meeting has fully matured. However, White opposed Khrushchev's opinion under the pretext that "summit meetings would encounter difficulties." He said that the United States still insists that "several lower-level meetings must be held first" before a summit meeting is held.

    西方舆论普遍重视赫鲁晓夫讲话
    要求东西方会谈呼声继续高涨
    美国国务院重弹滥调阻挠召开首脑会议
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联提出的召开东西方最高级会议的主张，仍是目前国际舆论注意的中心。要求早日召开最高级会议的运动，正在各国继续广泛深入地展开。
    赫鲁晓夫22日在明斯克发表的关于国际形势的谈话，进一步推动了要求举行最高级会议的浪潮。这次谈话受到各国舆论的普遍重视。
    西德报纸十分重视赫鲁晓夫演说中关于德国问题的主张和对阿登纳给布尔加宁复信的评论。
    许多西德报纸对赫鲁晓夫再次主张通过各国政府首脑会议解决争执问题表示满意。
    西德“议会政治新闻公报”报道，社会民主党新闻处领导人海?主张“仔细研究”赫鲁晓夫关于德国统一问题的建议。海?要求西德政府不要再对苏联关于德国问题的各项建议都给予否定的答复，而要提出关于统一德国的计划和建议。
    “新莱因报”写道，赫鲁晓夫关于无原子武器区和关于欧洲集体安全条约的声明表明，苏联“对缓和欧洲紧张局势多么关心。”报纸强调指出，苏联的这种态度也有助于解决德国问题。
    巴黎不少报刊详细报道了赫鲁晓夫的谈话，并且强调指出，苏联政府认为召开东西方最高级会议来迅速解决迫切的国际问题具有重要意义。
    “回声报”就赫鲁晓夫的讲话发表评论说，“在今天的条件下，唯一的出路是制止军备竞赛和战争，通过谈判方式来安排和解。”
    据法新社报道，法国首都外交界人士认为，赫鲁晓夫的这次讲话值得极其慎重地加以研究。
    英国工党议员28日在下院再次要求政府采取具体步骤来组织东西方最高级会议，以便解决悬而未决的国际问题。
    工党议员刘易斯要求政府回答什么时候才同意举行高级会议。他指出，在这方面目前还没有任何进展。工党领袖盖次克尔要求政府明确宣布赞成举行最高级会议。
    代理首相巴特勒企图规避这些问题，他说，必须等到政府答复了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁1月8日的来信以后，才能答复这些问题。
    加拿大前外交部长27日晚上说，西方国家应当“采取主动”同苏联进行谈判以实现世界和平。
    他说，“实力”只是一种“短期力量”，“谈判是导向世界和平的唯一道路”。他认为，谈判“就像导弹和火箭一样重要”。
    面对着公众舆论的强大压力，西方国家的政府不得不采取应付的手法。法国外交部长比诺27日在电视谈话中重申要在举行东西方首脑会议之前先举行外长会议来拟订议程。他说，召开一次“只确定议程、但不讨论问题本身”的外交部长会议，“也许会是通往东西方最高级会议的最实际和最快捷的途径”。
    比诺在谈话中表示，目前对举行东西方最高级会议的唯一障碍只是确定议程的问题。他说，这个问题应该是“易于解决的”。比诺认为最高级会议的议程中可能包括裁军问题、德国统一问题和对不发达国家进行援助的问题等。他还主张只让与议程直接有关的国家参加会议。
    但是，美国政府却仍然坚持死硬立场，不肯前进一步。美国国务院发言人怀特28日重申，美国拒绝早日召开东西方最高级会议。
    怀特是在评论赫鲁晓夫22日在明斯克的演说时发言的，它表明美国仍然坚持阻挠和拖延召开这种会议的态度。赫鲁晓夫曾经指出，召开东西方最高级会议的必要性已经完全成熟。但是怀特却以所谓“政府首脑会议会遭到困难”为借口，反对赫鲁晓夫的意见。他说，美国仍然坚持，在召开最高级会议以前，“必须先举行几次较低级的会议”。
