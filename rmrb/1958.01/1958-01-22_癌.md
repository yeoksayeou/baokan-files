Cancer

After reading the article "Individualism and Cancer" on page 8 of the People's Daily on January 7th, I felt deeply. As a doctor, I would like to talk specifically about the problem of cancer.

To date, the causes of cancer are still unclear. However, it is known that cancer is a tumor composed of a highly malignant group of cells. It can grow and multiply in any part of the human body, taking nutrients and releasing toxins. Even more vicious and insidious is its ability to metastasize—it often detaches from its original growth site and spreads to various parts of the body along the lymphatic vessels or blood vessels. At this point, it truly "spreads out, with endless harm." Doctors are helpless against this.

Moreover, cancer invades people quietly. Without people realizing it, it has already lurked and is rapidly multiplying and growing, without giving people obvious sensations. Once there is a sensation, it is often already terminally ill and incurable. This is another insidious and ruthless aspect of cancer.

However, don't be intimidated by it. As long as we are always vigilant and pay close attention, we can still overcome it.

Early diagnosis and early treatment are effective ways to deal with cancer. Although the early symptoms of cancer are not significant, there are still some symptoms after all. For example, the early manifestation of breast cancer is just the appearance of a gradually enlarging lump in the breast, which is neither painful nor itchy, so most people don't pay attention to it. By the time it grows and ulcerates, the scope of the cancer is already quite wide, and it is very likely that metastasis has already occurred. The early symptoms of gastric cancer are just some mild gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients often think that they have ordinary stomach problems or poor digestion and ignore them, until obvious digestive disorders develop, making people thin and weak before seeking medical attention. Patients with rectal cancer often think that it doesn't matter if there is some blood in the stool or some diarrhea, or they think that it is hemorrhoids and treat themselves with random medications. When the disease does not improve, and gradually develops into difficulty in defecation, and the person becomes thinner and more and more listless, they panic. Sudden vaginal bleeding in postmenopausal women is often an early signal of cervical cancer, but unfortunately, most people do not pay attention to it and delay treatment until very late. When lung cancer patients seek medical attention, they have mostly lost the opportunity for treatment. Early patients mostly think that there is nothing wrong with some coughing and occasional blood in the sputum. If they can seek medical treatment early, then, relying on surgical removal of diseased tissue, or using radiation to kill cancer cells, there is hope of a cure.

In addition, Professor L.F. Larionov, Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, tells us: "Prevention of cancer is entirely possible" because "modern oncology has clearly affirmed the following three points": First, "malignant tumors can never occur in normal, unchanged tissues. Usually, before it occurs, there is often a long period of change in the area, which is the so-called 'precancerous lesion'"; second, "the causes of precancerous lesions are mostly well understood"; and third, "preventing precancerous lesions, or treating them in a timely manner, can confidently prevent the occurrence of cancer" (the above quotations are all from the January 1958 issue of "Popular Medicine").

Precancerous lesions are closely related to people's bad habits in daily life. For example, the incidence of lung cancer in smokers is ten times greater than in non-smokers, and people who drink abnormally hot tea or soup have a greater chance of developing stomach cancer or esophageal cancer than those who do not.

From this, it can be seen that cancer is not an incurable disease; if it is said to be an incurable disease, it only refers to its late stage. As long as we pay attention to hygiene in daily life, get rid of bad habits, prevent problems before they occur, or if we suspect that there are signs of cancer, we will nip it in the bud at an early stage, then we can completely overcome it, just like defeating the cancer of individualism on the ideological front.

    癌

    看了1月7日人民日报第八版“个人主义与癌”一文，深有所感。作为医生，我愿就癌症这个问题专门谈一谈。
    到目前为止，发生癌症的原因还不清楚。但已确知，癌是由一团恶性程度很高的细胞群组成的肿瘤。它能够在人体的任何部分生长、繁殖，一面夺取养料，一面放出毒素。更凶恶毒辣的是它会转移——它常常在原生长的地方脱落下来，沿着淋巴管或血管散布到身体各部。这时候可真是“传播出去，流毒无穷”了。医生对此，束手无策。
    而且，癌侵犯人总是悄悄的。人在不知不觉间，它已潜伏了下来，并且迅速繁殖生长，却不给人以明显的感觉。一旦感觉，往往已是病入膏肓，无药可医了。这正是癌的又一阴险狠毒处。
    不过，也别给它吓倒。只要我们时时警惕，密切注意，还是可以战胜它的。
    早期诊断、早期治疗，是对付癌症有效的办法。虽然，早期的癌症症状不显著，但毕竟还是有一些症状的。譬如，乳腺癌早期的表现，只是在乳房内出现一个逐渐增大的硬结，既不痛也不痒，一般人也就不去注意它，等到它长大溃烂时，癌的范围就已相当广了，而且很可能已经发生了转移。胃癌的早期症状，只是一些轻微的消化道的症状，病人常常自以为是普通的胃病或消化不好，不予理会，直到产生明显的消化障碍，使得人消瘦软弱的时候才去求医。直肠癌的病人，常以为大便中带些血或有些腹泻等，没大关系，或自以为是痔疮，自己乱投药石，看看病不见轻，而且逐渐发生大便困难，人愈来愈瘦，愈来愈没有精神，才着慌起来。绝经后的妇女忽然又有阴道流血，这常常是子宫颈癌的早期信号，可惜大多数人不予重视，拖延到很晚才求治。肺癌患者就诊时，多已失去了治疗的机会，早期的患者大都以为有些咳嗽和偶尔痰中带些血没有关系。如果他们能够及早医治，那末，依靠手术切除病变组织，或用放射能照射消灭癌细胞，是有治好的希望的。
    除此之外，苏联医学科学院通讯院士Л·Φ·拉利奥诺夫教授告诉我们：“预防癌肿是完全可能的”，因为“现代肿瘤学已经明确地肯定了下列三个论点”，一是“恶性肿瘤绝不可能在正常的、无改变的组织中发生。通常在它发生以前，局部往往已有一个长时期的改变，亦即是所谓的‘癌前病变’”；二是“引起癌前病变的原因，大多数已经很好地被了解了”；三是“预防癌前病变，或者及时地加以治疗，就能有把握地防止了癌肿的发生”（以上引文均见1958年1月号“大众医学”）。
    癌前病变和人们在日常生活中的不良习惯很有关系，例如吸烟者的肺癌发生率较不吸烟者大十倍，喝异常滚热的茶或汤的人发生胃癌或食道癌的机会比不喝者多。
    由此可见，癌还不是绝症；如果说是绝症，那也只是指它的晚期罢了。只要我们日常注意卫生，戒除生活中的不良习惯，防患于未然，或者疑有癌症苗头，即扼杀它于早期，那末，我们是完全可以战胜它的，像思想战线上战胜个人主义癌症一样。
