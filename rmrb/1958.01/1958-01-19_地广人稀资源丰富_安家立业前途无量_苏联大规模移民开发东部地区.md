Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th – In recent years, a large number of residents in the Soviet Union have moved from the central regions to Siberia, Kazakhstan, and the Far East for development. They have already settled down and established their careers there, greatly promoting the development of the local national economy. It is expected that the work of immigration to the eastern regions will continue on a large scale this year.

The newly arrived immigrants have brought a large amount of labor to the eastern regions. For example, the Kazakh Republic has added approximately 42,000 immigrant families in the past three years, including more than 70,000 laborers. This has played a significant role in Kazakhstan's recent reclamation of more than 21 million hectares of wasteland and its becoming the Soviet Union's second largest granary. In the past seven years, the labor force of collective farms in the Khabarovsk Krai has also increased by nearly half.

As a result of the migration of residents, some previously backward collective farms have become wealthy. For example, after the "19th Party Congress" collective farm in Irkutsk Oblast increased its labor force by 150 people (equivalent to more than half of the original labor force), the farm reclaimed 1,500 hectares of wasteland and built 50 houses and many livestock barns. The income of the villagers has greatly increased. Now, this collective farm has become a wealthy farm with millions of rubles in income.

The eastern regions of the Soviet Union are vast and rich in resources, but sparsely populated. Take Siberia, for example, its area is about 10 million square kilometers, almost half of the Soviet territory. However, there are currently only more than 18 million residents in Siberia. The Soviet Union has always paid attention to immigration to the eastern regions. From 1926 to 1956, 16.4 million residents migrated to the eastern regions, which greatly helped the development of the eastern regions.

In recent years, the state has specifically formulated preferential measures for the relocated residents so that the new residents can settle down and produce with peace of mind. For example, the residents' travel expenses are borne by the state, and they can be exempted from agricultural tax for several years after arriving in the new area. New residents can apply for state loans for production, etc. The leaders of collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations are very concerned about the new residents. Close friendships have also been established between old and new residents.

    地广人稀资源丰富　安家立业前途无量
    苏联大规模移民开发东部地区
    据新华社莫斯科18日电　苏联近年来有大批居民从中央地区迁往西伯利亚、哈萨克和远东地区进行开发。他们已经在那里安家立业，大大地促进了当地国民经济的发展。预计，今年向东部地区移民的工作还要大规模地进行。
    新到的移民给东部地区带来了大量的劳动力。例如，哈萨克共和国在过去三年中就增加了约四万二千家移民，其中有七万多个劳动力。这对哈萨克最近几年开垦两千一百多万公顷荒地和成为苏联第二大谷仓都起了很大作用。在过去七年中，伯力边疆区集体农庄的劳动力也增加了将近一半。
    由于迁移居民的结果，一些过去比较落后的集体农庄变得富裕起来了。例如，伊尔库次克州的“第十九次党代表大会”集体农庄由于增加了一百五十个劳动力（相当于原有劳动力的一半以上）以后，农庄就开垦了一千五百公顷荒地，建造了五十幢房子和许多牲畜房。庄员的收入大大增加了。现在，这个农庄已经成为有成百万卢布收入的富有农庄。
    苏联东部地区地大物博、人口稀少。拿西伯利亚来说，它的面积约有一千万平方公里，几乎等于苏联领土的一半。但是，现在西伯利亚的居民只有一千八百多万。苏联一向注意向东部地区移民。从1926年到1956年，迁移到东部地区的居民就有一千六百四十万人，这大大有助于东部地区的开发。
    近年来，国家对迁移的居民专门订出了优待的办法，使新居民能够安心生产。例如居民移居的旅费由国家负担，到新地以后可以在若干年内免交农业税，新居民可以向国家贷款来进行生产等等。集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的领导对新居民都非常关心。老居民和新居民之间也建立了亲密的友谊。
