Notes
    Dulles slandered Bulganin's proposal to convene a top-level meeting of Eastern and Western countries as a "propaganda gimmick." However, when a reporter asked British Prime Minister Macmillan whether he considered the Soviet proposal a propaganda act, he replied, "We should never regard these issues as propaganda."

    Dulles slandered the Soviet proposal as "nothing new." But British Foreign Secretary Lloyd said that Bulganin's letter contained "new things" that "needed to be carefully considered."

    The two close allies did not necessarily deliberately disagree with the US Secretary of State, but because they did not dare to talk nonsense, they unintentionally gave Dulles two slaps in the face.

    两下嘴巴
    杜勒斯诬蔑布尔加宁提出的召开东西方国家最高级会议的建议，是一种“宣传伎俩”。但是，当记者问英国首相麦克米伦是否认为苏联的建议是一种宣传行动时，他回答说：“我们决不应当把这些问题看成是宣传”。
    杜勒斯诬蔑苏联的建议“没有什么新东西”。但是英国外交大臣劳埃德说：布尔加宁的信包含着“新的东西”，“需要小心地加以考虑”。
    两位亲密的盟友倒不一定故意同美国国务卿过不去，只是因为不敢胡说八道，就无意间给了杜勒斯两下嘴巴。
