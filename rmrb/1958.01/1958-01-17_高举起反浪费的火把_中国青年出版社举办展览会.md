Xinhua News Agency, January 16th. The China Youth Publishing House, by holding an exhibition, has ignited the fire of anti-waste, fiercely exposing the facts of massive waste of state wealth within the unit.

    On display at the exhibition were three "loss expense" statistical tables, revealing that the publishing house had reported expenses under the name of "loss expense" alone, amounting to more than 87,700 yuan in the past nearly three years. In addition, the exhibition also exposed many serious waste phenomena in the publishing house's topic selection, commissioning of manuscripts, editing and proofreading, and business management.

    Some topic selections were determined blindly. In order to cooperate with the land reclamation task, some editors, as long as they found the titles of foreign-published books and magazines related to land reclamation, blindly asked people to translate them without asking about the content of the original text. As a result, six of the nine manuscripts were not applicable, and the rejection fees alone cost 700 yuan. In a doggerel poem "Put in the basket is a dish, the title is right and treat it as a treasure," it was revealed that when an editorial office selected and compiled geographies of various countries, some of the selected materials were outdated materials from certain countries, and some of the translations were of very poor quality. In the end, only one book could be published, and it had to be completely discarded due to factual errors, wasting 3,500 yuan.

    This publishing house used the so-called "spreading a wide net" method to solicit manuscripts from authors. A statistical table revealed the "manuscript solicitation activities" of the publishing house in Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and other places in 1954: 251 book commissioning contracts were signed with authors, and more than 23,000 yuan in advance royalties were paid. However, after three and a half years, only 59 manuscripts could be adopted, and more than 70% of the advance royalties were wasted.

    The exhibition also exposed the waste phenomena of the "China Youth," "Middle School Students," "Traveler," and "Rural Youth" magazines published by the publishing house. Among the 67 issues of "China Youth" magazine published since 1955, there were 137 incidents of loss. The 20th issue of "China Youth" published last year wasted more than 10,000 yuan because the foreign letters on the cover were misspelled. In order to pursue formality, the "Rural Youth" magazine changed the small format welcomed by farmers to a large format, and the cover alone cost an extra 37,000 yuan a year.

    The materials at the exhibition revealed that the publishing house was also indifferent to state property in daily business management. When the China Juvenile and Children Publishing House, which is related to the business of this publishing house, printed "Picture Books for Young Children," it blindly estimated the number of copies to be printed, resulting in a backlog of paper worth 150,000 yuan. Some leading cadres of the "Rural Youth" magazine, under the idea of "If they eat ours, they will write for us," often had to treat guests to eat and drink, whether for soliciting manuscripts, selecting topics, or soliciting opinions. When inviting authors to a meeting, the hosts and guests numbered thirty, but they bought ninety-three catties of watermelon, and the cost of cigarettes and candies was more than forty yuan. They couldn't finish eating it, so they found someone to help them eat it. An editorial office of the China Youth Publishing House had a get-together with a certain unit. Of the 68 people, one-third were hosts, spending 408 yuan, an average of six yuan per person from the state.

    In order to prevent similar phenomena from happening again in the future, the publishing house has adopted the policy of learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones. In addition to resolutely igniting the fire on themselves and boldly exposing the serious waste phenomena in their own unit, thereby mobilizing the masses to speak out freely on this matter, they have also initially formulated a rectification plan to correct and prevent waste and submitted it to the masses for discussion.

### 高举起反浪费的火把  中国青年出版社举办展览会

    高举起反浪费的火把
    中国青年出版社举办展览会
    新华社16日讯　中国青年出版社用举办展览会的办法，点起反浪费之火，狠狠地揭发了本单位大量浪费国家财富的事实。
    展览会上，挂着三幅“损失费”统计表，揭露了这个出版社在过去将近三年的时间中仅仅以“损失费”名义报销的款项即达八万七千七百多元。另外，展览会也揭露了这个出版社在选题、约稿、编校、经营管理等方面也都存在着许多严重浪费的现象。
    有些选题是盲目确定的。为了配合垦荒任务，有的编辑只要发现国外出版的书刊杂志中标题与垦荒有关的，不问原文内容怎样，就盲目请人翻译，结果九本书稿中有六本不适用，光退稿费就花了七百元。在一首“放在篮里就是菜，书名对头当宝贝”的打油诗中，揭露了一个编辑室选编各国地理时，选的东西有的是某些国家的已经过时的材料，有的译文质量太低，最后只能出了一本书，又因发生事实错误只得全部作废，浪费了三千五百元。
    这个社是用了所谓“撒大网”的方法向作者约稿的。一个统计表上揭发了这个社在1954年派人到上海、南京、武汉等地的“约稿活动”：和作者订了二百五十一本书的约稿合同，预付出二万三千多元的稿费，但到现在已历时三年半，能采用的书稿才只五十九本，70％多的预付稿费白花了。
    展览会也揭露了这个出版社出版的“中国青年”、“中学生”、“旅行家”、“农村青年”等杂志社的浪费现象。“中国青年”杂志社从1955年起出版的六十七期刊物中，曾发生了一百三十七次有损失的事故。去年出版的第二十期“中国青年”，即因拼错了封面的外文字母浪费掉一万多元。“农村青年”杂志社为追求形式，把农民所欢迎的小本改为大本，仅封面一项，一年就多花了三万七千元。
    展览会上的材料揭露：这个出版社在日常经营管理上，对国家的财产也是满不在乎的。和这个社业务有关的中国少年儿童出版社印刷“幼儿图册”时，盲目估计印数，结果积压了价值十五万元的纸张。“农村青年”杂志社部分领导干部在“吃了咱们的就会给咱们写稿”的思想下，无论约稿、选题，或征求意见，往往都要请客吃喝，在一次请作者开会的时候，宾主三十人，却买了九十三斤西瓜，连香烟、糖果等费共花了四十多元，吃不完，就找人帮着吃。中国青年出版社一个编辑室和某单位联欢，六十八人中，三分之一是主人，花钱四百零八元，平均每人花掉国家六块钱。
    为了今后不再发生类似现象，这个出版社采取了惩前毖后的方针，除坚决引火烧身、大胆地揭露了本单位严重的浪费现象，从而发动群众对此进行大鸣大放外，同时已初步订出了纠正和防止浪费的整改方案交给群众讨论。
