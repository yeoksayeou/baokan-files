    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway, spanning 668.2 kilometers through 19 cities and counties in the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan, has been officially delivered for operation after more than five years of intense construction and remediation of defects. From now on, Sichuan Province, known in ancient times as the "Land of Abundance," has a railway trunk line connected to the national railway network, and the Shu Road is no longer difficult. This great railway connects the Southwest and Northwest with the rest of the country. We warmly congratulate the official opening of this new railway and celebrate this new victory in China's socialist construction.
    The Shu Road is difficult. In ancient times, many generals hesitated to advance, and many poets sighed at the mountains. "Even the yellow crane cannot fly over, and monkeys and apes struggle to climb." To build a road that makes the "Shu Road easy, as easy as walking on flat ground" is the long-cherished wish of the Chinese people for generations. However, thousands of years have passed, and the steep cliffs and overlapping mountains of the Qinling Mountains still divide the north and south. There is no railway connecting the Southwest and Northwest. Since 1915, some Chinese and foreigners have attempted to build a railway connecting Sichuan and Shaanxi, but they all retreated in the face of the treacherous Qinling Mountains.
    It is not that the Chinese people have suddenly become extraordinarily powerful in these eight years. Building the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was also fraught with difficulties for us. 80% of this railway passes through mountainous areas such as the Qinling Mountains, Daba Mountains, and Jianmen Mountains. These mountainous areas are mostly in earthquake zones of magnitude six or seven, with extremely complex geological conditions, including ancient glacial relics, large and small faults, and continuous collapse zones. The remaining 20% of the line is in hilly and plain areas. These hilly and plain areas have high rainfall, abundant groundwater, loose strata, and weathered and broken rock layers, which also pose many difficulties for design and construction. To build a railway in this vast landscape, in this all-encompassing and extremely complex geological environment known as a "geological exhibition," one cannot succeed without the spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." We Communists have always been promoters. Anything that is beneficial to the people and socialism, no matter how difficult, the Communists will promote it. The Chinese people have long expected to build a railway from Shaanxi to Sichuan. The traffic in the Southwest and Northwest relies on this to be strengthened. The grain produced by the people of Sichuan, the various cash crops planted, the livestock raised, and the rich minerals buried underground all need a railway to transport them out; the equipment and materials needed for the construction of Sichuan also need a railway to transport them in. No matter how high the mountains or how deep the water, we Communists will promote the birth of this railway.
    Under the leadership of the Party and the government, with the help of Soviet experts, and with the support of the people of the whole country, the railway workers and engineering technicians finally built the Baoji-Chengdu Railway after more than five years of hard work, writing a rare miracle in the history of world railway construction. Look at the heroic deeds of our working class in building the Baoji-Chengdu Railway! They opened up more than 300 tunnels and erected more than 900 bridges on the 600-kilometer railway, completing more than 60 million cubic meters of earth and stone work for the roadbed. On average, there is one tunnel every less than three kilometers, one and a half bridges every kilometer, and 100,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work to be excavated. If anyone doubts the strength of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway will give him the best lesson. The completion of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway once again proves that the Chinese working class and the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China are an invincible construction army. In the face of such a construction army, high mountains must bow their heads, and rivers must give way.
    We celebrate the full opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, celebrating the victory of our working class and our people over the treacherous Qinling Mountains. We have already done many things that our predecessors have not done; we will do many more things that our predecessors have not done. That is to build our country into

### 把西南西北和全国连接起来了

    把西南西北和全国连接起来了
    贯穿陕、甘、川三省十九个市、县，全长六百六十八点二公里的宝成铁路，经过五年多的紧张施工和整治病害，现在已经成为一条质量优良的铁路正式交付营业了。从此，古称“天府之国”的四川省有了一条同全国铁路网联结起来的铁路干线，蜀道不再难；这条伟大的铁路就把西南西北和全国连接起来了。我们热烈地祝贺这条新的铁路的正式通车，祝贺我国社会主义建设事业中这一新的胜利。
    蜀道难，古来多少战将裹足不前，多少诗人望山兴叹，“黄鹤之飞尚不得过，猿猱欲度愁攀缘”。修一条大路，使“蜀道易，易于履平地”，是中国人民世代相袭的愿望。但几千年的时间过去了，峭壁千仞，万山重叠的秦岭依然横断南北，西南、西北没有一条铁路相通。自1915年以来，也曾有些中国人和外国人试图修筑一条贯通川陕的铁路，但是一待他们目睹险恶的秦岭，尽皆知难而退。
    中国人民并不是这八年中忽然变得神通广大。修筑宝成铁路，对我们说来同样是困难重重的事情。这条铁路，有80％的线路在秦岭、大巴、剑门等山岳地区经过。这些山岳地区多是六、七级地震区，地质情况极其复杂，有古代冰川的遗址，有大大小小的断层，有连续的崩坍地带。还有20％的线路是在丘陵和平原地区。这些丘陵和平原地区雨量大，地下水旺，地层松散，岩层风化破碎，同样给设计和施工造成许多困难。要在这千山万水之间，在这被称为“地质展览会”的包罗万象、极其复杂的地质情况下修筑一条铁路，没有“愚公移山”的精神是必不能成功的。我们共产党人历来是促进派，一切有利于人民、有利于社会主义的事情，纵有千难万难，共产党人也要去促进它。中国人民久已期望修一条从陕西到四川的铁路，西南西北的交通赖此加强，四川人民打下的粮食，种植的各种经济作物、饲养的家畜和埋藏在地下的富饶的矿产，都需要有一条铁路运出来；四川的建设所需要的设备、器材，也需要有一条铁路运进去。山再高，水再深，我们共产党人也要促进这条铁路的诞生。
    在党和政府的领导下，在苏联专家的帮助下，在全国人民的支援下，经过五年多的艰苦努力，筑路的工人和工程技术人员终于建成了宝成铁路，在世界铁路建筑史上写下了不多见的奇迹。看一看我们的工人阶级在建设宝成铁路中的壮举吧！他们在六百多公里的铁路上开拓了三百多座隧道，架设了九百多座桥梁，完成了路基土石方工程六千多万立方公尺。平均不到三公里就有一座隧道，每一公里就有一座半桥梁，就要挖土石方十万立方公尺。如果有人怀疑中国工人阶级和中国人民的力量的话，宝成铁路会给他上最好的一课。宝成铁路的建成，又一次证明了在中国共产党领导下的中国工人阶级和中国人民，是一支战无不胜、攻无不克的建设大军，在这样的建设大军面前，高山也要低头，河水也要让路。
    我们庆祝宝成铁路全线通车，庆祝我国工人阶级和我国人民战胜了险峻的秦岭。我们已经做了许多前人未曾做到的事情；我们还要做许多前人未曾做过的事情。这就是把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。
