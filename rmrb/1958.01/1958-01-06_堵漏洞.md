	Plugging the Leak
	Liu Baohai, Worker at Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 7
	The waves of Dalian Bay surged, violently crashing against the stone shore of Petroleum Plant No. 7. At the foot of the mountain, the towering oil refining towers stood tall, like giants overlooking the misty Sanshan Island. The lights on the tower resembled a string of candied haws stretching into the gray-black sky; the lights swayed in the violent wind.

	Sun Chenghua, the first operator of the cracked gasoline workshop, ran back and forth in the wind and snow, sometimes climbing the iron ladder of the oil refining tower, and sometimes drilling into the scorching hot tower bottom.

	This young man was not tall, with thick black eyebrows above a pair of mischievous round eyes. The black pupils rolled around in the night sky, full of energy! He graduated from the Petroleum Plant No. 7 Technical School, and soon after arriving at the cracked gasoline workshop, he became the first operator.

	"Xiao Zhou, check the liquid level position, I'll go up to the top of the tower to take a look." Sun Chenghua said as he climbed the iron ladder next to the tower.

	Xiao Zhou was an impatient person and suddenly opened the liquid level oil valve wide, oil spraying out of the serpentine cooling barrel in "thumps" all over the ground.

	Hearing the "thumping" sound, Sun Chenghua turned his head and ran down from the iron ladder, shining a flashlight on the solidified black oil on the ground, and asked Xiao Zhou with wide eyes, "What happened?" He felt extremely distressed, as if a piece of his own flesh had been cut off. He wished he could suck the oil into his stomach and then spit it back into the tower.

	Xiao Zhou hated himself for being too careless, and slapped his thigh while staring at the oil! He hurriedly used his fingers to smear the congealed oil piece by piece into the oil collection tank next to the serpentine cooling barrel. Sun Chenghua also squatted on the ground and smeared the oil with Xiao Zhou. "Look! Number three liquid level pipe, look quickly!" When Xiao Zhou stood up, he pointed at the oil refining tower and exclaimed, "Oh no!" Hot oil, like the tongue of a poisonous snake, spurted out from the middle of the tower, mixed with white smoke, rolling onto the red walls of the heating furnace.

	"This is terrible!..." Sun Chenghua cursed a few times, trying to calm himself down from the tension.

	Xiao Zhou was frightened, staring with his two small black bean eyes, anxiously pacing back and forth. Oil with a pressure of several hundred degrees would quickly turn into a pillar of fire in the atmosphere. The oil refinery, and even the lives of the workers, would be destroyed in the fire!

	In the blink of an eye, Sun Chenghua had an idea! He took off running, and with a "thud" he slipped on the oil patch, landing in a big "face plant." His fur hat fell off, his leg was bruised, and his lip was cut! ...He felt a cold sweat on his forehead, and stood up with a "whoosh," not even bothering to pick up his fur hat, and ran towards the iron ladder of the oil refining tower.

	Xiao Zhou was a newbie, with no experience. He took out a water-soaked seaweed mat from the fire box and wandered around aimlessly, wanting to use this seaweed mat to plug the oil that was spewing out. But the oil column was suspended in the middle of the tower, neither touching the sky nor the ground, how could he plug it with a seaweed mat?

	At this time, Qu, the second shift leader, and others also ran out of the automatic control instrument room. Shift Leader Qu shouted, "Xiao Zhou, quickly go around to the tower from the iron ladder!" The shout mixed with the howling of the wind.

	Sun Chenghua flew up the iron ladder. He looked up and saw that the dozens of layers of perforated ladder plates overlapped, making him feel dizzy. The condensed steam dripped down, falling right into his eyes. He closed his eyes tightly, knowing only to climb upward! Panting, he finally climbed onto the fifth-floor platform. He ran across the platform, and with a few quick steps, he went around to the back of the oil refining tower, slipping onto the small walkway above the Number Three liquid level pipe. The small walkway was surrounded by black oil and white smoke, making it impossible to approach. His eyes shining, he held his breath and lay prone on the small walkway.

	The scorching hot oil gas baked his face, he felt a burning pain, as if salt water was being poured into fresh meat! The toxic gas drilled into his nose and eyes, and he felt suffocated and dizzy, as if countless poisonous needles were pricking his lungs! The thick smoke made his eyes water, as if someone was pouring chili water into them.

	He gritted his teeth, steeled his heart, reached down and grabbed the valve near the base of the tower on the Number Three liquid level pipe. He desperately twisted it, twisted it, and the oil stopped spraying!

	Xiao Zhou helped Sun Chenghua down the tower along the iron ladder. Shift Leader Qu and others immediately surrounded him, asking questions. Sun Chenghua said, "The plug on the branch of that liquid level pipe was loose, so the hot oil came out. We must have the pipe workers repair it tomorrow during the day."

	Shift Leader Qu put the white fur hat he had just picked up on his head in one fell swoop, and said playfully, "Look, this is a Kazakh-style Bao Zheng!" Laughter overwhelmed the sound of the wind.

	The oil refining tower was producing steadily as usual, the hot oil seemed to be angry with Sun Chenghua, gurgling and shouting in the tower! At this time, Shift Leader Qu wrote in the shift handover log: "In the second half of the night on the 19th, Comrade Sun Chenghua, unafraid of danger, skillfully blocked the oil leak accident on the liquid level pipe, guaranteeing an increase of 1,500 tons of gasoline by the end of the year!"

    堵漏洞
    东北石油七厂工人　刘宝海
    大连海湾掀起汹涌的浪涛，猛撞着石油七厂的石岸，山脚下炼油塔巍然屹立，像巨人似的了望着缥缈的三山岛，塔上的灯光像一串糖堆儿伸向那灰黑的天空；灯光在狂风中摇晃着。
    裂化汽油车间第一操作员孙承华在风雪中来回跑着，一会儿登上炼油塔的铁云梯；一会儿又钻进那灼热的塔底。
    这小伙子个儿不高，浓黑的眉毛下生着一对顽皮的圆眼睛，那黑眼珠儿在夜空中出溜出溜地转着，可有精神呢！他身穿着扎竖道儿的棉工装，头上戴着顶哈萨克式白翻毛皮帽，那个“率”劲儿就不用说了！他是从石油七厂技工学校毕业的，到裂化汽油车间不久便当上了第一操作员。
      “小周，检查一下液面的位置，我到塔顶上看看。”孙承华说着便登上塔旁的铁云梯。
    小周是个急脾气的人，猛地把液面油阀门开大了，油从蛇管冷却桶内“突突”地喷了一地。
    孙承华听到“突突”的声音扭头从铁云梯上跑下来，用手电筒照着地面上的已凝固的黑油，瞪着两眼问小周：“怎么搞的？”他心疼极了，就像自己身上割掉一块肉似的，他恨不得把油吸到肚子里，然后再吐到塔里去。
    小周恨自己太粗心，望着油直拍大胯！他急忙用手指把凝油一下一下地抹到蛇管冷却桶旁的收油槽里。孙承华也蹲在地上和小周一起抹油。“看！三号液面管，快看！”当小周站起来时指着炼油塔惊叫：“呀！”热油像条毒蛇的舌头从塔的半腰喷出来，夹着白色的浓烟卷到加热炉的红墙上。
      “这还了得！……”孙承华咒骂几声，尽量使自己从紧张中镇定下来。
    小周吓傻了，瞪着两颗小黑豆眼儿，急得团团转，好几百度有压力的油在大气中很快就会变成一道火柱，炼油厂，以至工人的生命将在火中毁灭！
    孙承华一眨眼——主意来了！他拔腿就跑，“咕登”一声被刚才那块油地滑了个大“马趴”，皮帽摔掉了，腿碰肿了，嘴唇格破了！……他憋了一脑门儿冷汗，“腾”地站起来，连皮帽子也顾不得拿，便奔向炼油塔的铁云梯。
    小周是新手儿，没经验。他从消防箱内抱出个水浸海草席乱转悠，他想用这海草席堵住那喷出的油。可是油柱悬在塔的当腰，上不着天，下不着地，怎能用海草席堵住呢？
    这时二班曲班长等人也从自动控制仪表房内跑出来，曲班长高喊：“小周，快从铁云梯绕到塔上！”这喊声和狂风嘶叫的声音混在一起了。
    孙承华飞跑上铁云梯，他抬头向上面一看——十几层的透孔梯板重叠在一起，使人感到头晕眼花，上面的蒸汽冷凝水滴下来，正好掉在他的眼里，他紧闭着眼光知道向上登！他喘着气，终于爬上第五层平台，跑过平台，几个箭步便绕到炼油塔后边，溜到三号液面管上方的小走台上，小走台被黑油和白烟所包围，使人不能接近，他两眼闪着光，屏住呼吸趴在小走台上。
    灼热的油气烤着他的脸，他感到火辣辣的，如同往鲜肉里浇盐水一样疼！毒瓦斯钻进他的鼻眼儿里，他感觉窒息和头昏，就像有无数颗毒针扎着他的肺腑！浓烟熏得他两眼直流眼泪，仿佛有谁在往他眼里倒辣椒水一样。
    他咬紧牙关，一狠心，向下一伸手便抓住那三号液面管靠塔根的阀门，他拼命地拧着，拧着，油，停止喷射了！
    小周沿着铁云梯，把孙承华扶到塔下，曲班长等人立刻围上来，问长问短。孙承华说：“那液面管支路的堵头松了，所以热油钻出来，明天白天一定得叫管工修理。”
    曲班长把刚才拾起的那顶白翻毛皮帽，一下子便扣在他头上，俏皮地说：“看，这个哈萨克式的包丞相！”笑声压倒风声。
    炼油塔和往常一样，平稳地生产着，热油好像在生孙承华的气，在塔里咕噜咕噜地直叫唤！这时，曲班长在交接班日记上写道：“19日下半夜，孙承华同志不怕危险，机智地堵塞了液面管冒油的事故，保证到年底增产一千五百吨汽油！”
