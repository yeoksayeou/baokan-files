    Book Prices and Editions
    Ding Meirong, Tangshan Railway Institute
    Recently, books are often published in hardcover, with high prices. Of course, hardcover books are beautiful and attractive, but we should also fully consider the economic conditions of the average person and print some paperback editions. The New Literature and Art Publishing House publishes works by Tagore, Shelley, and others, all in hardcover. For example, Tagore's "Stray Birds" has only fifty pages, but the price is forty-eight cents; "The Gardener" has only sixty-six pages, and the price is also fifty cents. Other books published by the People's Literature Publishing House and the Writers Publishing House are also relatively expensive. Therefore, I suggest that publishing houses fully consider the actual situation of readers, use their brains, think of ways to reduce costs, and do everything possible to make the published books both beautiful and affordable. I believe that even minor changes in this regard will be welcomed and appreciated by the majority of readers. We are looking forward to it!
    By the way, I would like to raise two related questions.
    We feel that some anthologies published now, although with different names, have many similarities in content. For example, "Song of Construction," "Poetry Selection" in 1955, "We Love Our Land," and other books have many repetitions, leaving readers wondering which one to buy. Another similar problem is that some works are published in magazines, then in single editions, then in anthologies published by publishing houses, and then in collected works, such as Liu Zhen's "Sister Chun." Thus, the same work is published several times in different places, which is a bit of a waste. I wonder what the author and the publishing house think about this.

    书价和版本
    唐山铁道学院　丁梅荣
    近来出书总是喜欢精装，定价很高。当然精装美观、漂亮，但也应充分考虑到一般人的经济条件，印些简装本。新文艺出版社出版泰戈尔、雪莱等人的作品，全是精装，如泰戈尔的“飞鸟集”，全书才五十页，定价却是四角八分；“游思集”才六十六页，定价也达五角。其他如人民文学出版社、作家出版社的书也比较贵了一些，因此我建议各出版社能充分地估计读者的实际情况，多开动脑筋，想些办法降低成本，尽一切可能做到出版的书既美观大方而又经济实惠。我相信如果能够在这方面有细微的改变，都会得到广大读者的欢迎和感激的，我们期待着！
    顺便我再提出两个相关的问题。
    我们觉得现在出版的一些选集，虽然名字各异，但内容却有许多相似之处。如“建设的歌”，1955年“诗选”，“我们爱我们的土地”等几册书，其中就有不少是重复的，弄得读者不知买哪一册好。另一种和此类似的问题是有些作品，
    在杂志上发表过，过后出单行本，出版社出选集，再后出合集，如刘真的“春大姐”就是。这样同一篇作品，在不同的地方出版好几次，未免有点浪费，不知作者和出版社的看法如何。
