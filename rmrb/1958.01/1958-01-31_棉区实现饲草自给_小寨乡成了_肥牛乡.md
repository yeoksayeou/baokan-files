    Cotton-Growing Areas Achieve Self-Sufficiency in Fodder
    Xiaozhai Township Becomes a “Fat Cattle Township”
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Of the 1,179 draught animals in the nineteen agricultural cooperatives of Xiaozhai Township, Ji County, Hebei Province, 56% reached over 70% fatness last year, and none died throughout the year. Therefore, they were commended by the county and called "Fat Cattle Township."
    At the beginning of last spring, draught animals with 70% to 80% fatness only accounted for 16% in this township. The cooperative members described the situation at that time as: "The cattle in the cooperative are worrying; they can't pull the plow or carry the seed drill." At that time, forty-nine had also died.
    In order to fundamentally reverse this situation, the Xiaozhai Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed a "Fat Cattle Township" campaign to all agricultural cooperatives in the township. In addition to explaining to everyone that draught animals would remain the main driving force for developing agricultural production for a considerable period of time, the township Party committee also summarized the feeding experience of Yue Zhuang Agricultural Cooperative, which had better livestock protection, and organized cadres from various cooperatives to visit and learn. This made the cadres realize that fattening livestock was entirely possible, thereby strengthening their confidence. The township Party committee focused on Yue Zhuang Agricultural Cooperative while strengthening its leadership over backward cooperatives. For example, the livestock of the youth team of Nanliang Agricultural Cooperative were thin. The township Party committee sent cadres to conduct an in-depth inspection and found that the feeder was not competent and the young people were using the cattle too harshly. Therefore, the committee suggested that the cooperative select cadres with strong work ability to help the team improve feeding management, and the weak condition of the draught animals quickly reversed.
    This township is a cotton-producing area, and fodder has always been in short supply in spring and scarce in summer. Before the spring plowing last year, the township mobilized cooperative members to cut grass after the grass sprouted, to solve the problem of insufficient fodder; and called on cooperative members to "go to the fields with a basket on their back, and bring back a basket of grass," so that the grass cutting and storage movement persisted until after autumn. The entire township became a fodder self-sufficient township for the first time.
    After research, the township advocated the form of household feeding, selected experienced old farmers to serve as feeders, and established a system combining feeders and users.

### 棉区实现饲草自给  小寨乡成了“肥牛乡”

    棉区实现饲草自给
    小寨乡成了“肥牛乡”
    据新华社讯　河北省冀县小寨乡十九个农业社的一千一百七十九头耕畜，去年有56％达到七成膘以上，全年没有死过一头，因而受到了县里表扬，被称为“肥牛乡”。
    在去年开春的时候，这个乡七成到八成膘的耕畜还只占16％，社员形容当时的情况是：“社里的牛，叫人愁，拉不动犁，带不动耧。”当时还死掉了四十九头。
    为了从根本上扭转这种局面，中共小寨乡委员会向全乡农业社提出开展“肥牛乡”运动。乡党委除向大家讲清耕畜在相当长时期内仍是发展农业生产的主要动力以外，又总结了保畜较好的岳庄农业社的饲养经验，组织各社的干部们去参观，使干部们认识到喂肥牲口是完全可能的，从而坚定了信心。乡党委一面抓住岳庄农业社为重点，一方面加强了对后进社的领导。如南良农业社青年队的牲口瘦，乡党委就派干部深入检查，发现饲养员不胜任，青年们役使耕牛又狠，于是建议社里抽出工作能力强的干部，帮助这个队改进饲养管理，使耕畜瘦弱情况很快扭转过来。
    这个乡是棉产区，饲草历来是春缺、夏季荒。去年春耕前，全乡就发动社员在青草出土后割草，解决饲草不足问题；并且号召社员“下地背着筐，回来一筐草”，使打草贮饲运动一直坚持到秋后。全乡第一次成为饲草自给乡。
    经过研究，全乡提倡了分户喂养的形式，选拔有经验的老农担任饲养员，并建立了饲养员和使役员结合的制度。
