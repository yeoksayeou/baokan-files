Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch. According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 16th: A United Press reporter from Miami described the poverty of 80,000 agricultural workers in Florida.

The reporter said that in Homestead, a huge agricultural center south of Miami, the lines for agricultural workers receiving soup kitchen rations stretched for two blocks. In Immokalee, the center of tomato and potato cultivation, thousands of workers would have starved to death long ago without the relief efforts of local residents.

The reporter said that the plight of these agricultural workers is the same as that of many workers wandering in other agricultural areas of Florida, all of whom are unable to find any work.

The reporter reported that a baby who "had not had a drop of milk for four days" was admitted to a hospital in Miami. The reporter pointed out that this was happening only twenty-five miles from Miami, while in Miami's four hundred luxurious hotels, the rich were paying one hundred dollars a day for a room.

    活活饿死和领救济汤
    佛州农业工人的苦境
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社纽约16日讯：合众社记者从迈阿密城发出的一条消息中叙述了佛罗里达州八万农业工人的贫困情况。
    记者说，在迈阿密南部的巨大农业中心——后姆斯台德市，农业工人领取救济汤的队伍长达两个街区。在西红柿和马铃薯种植中心的伊莫卡利，如果没有当地居民的救济，有上千的工人早已饿死了。
    记者说，这些农业工人的悲惨遭遇同在佛罗里达州其他各农业地区流浪的许多工人的遭遇一样，他们都得不到任何工作。
    记者报道说，在迈阿密的医院里曾接到一个“已经四天没有吃到一滴牛奶”的乳婴。记者指出说，这是发生在离迈阿密城仅仅二十五英里的地方，而在迈阿密的四百家豪华的大旅馆里，富翁们住上一天房间就付出一百美元。
