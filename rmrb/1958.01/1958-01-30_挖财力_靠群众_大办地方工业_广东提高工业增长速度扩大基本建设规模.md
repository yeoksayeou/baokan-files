    Digging for Wealth, Relying on the Masses, Vigorously Developing Local Industry
    Guangdong Increases Industrial Growth Rate and Expands Capital Construction Scale
    (Our newspaper, Guangzhou, January 29th) The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently made a decision, requiring all parts of the province to immediately overcome the backward state of industry while continuing to promote a high tide of agricultural production, so that industry can also achieve a great leap forward.
    The Provincial Committee requires all special districts, cities, counties, factories, mines, enterprises, and handicraft cooperatives to formulate their own advanced plans for striving for a great leap forward in industry on the basis of overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, and to first formulate advanced production plans and indicators for 1958, ensuring the overfulfillment of the 15% industrial output value growth rate target set by the Provincial Planning Commission for 1958, and striving to reach and exceed the 22% growth rate of 1956.
    A recent provincial planning conference has raised the original 1958 industrial output value growth rate from 11% over 1957 to 15%. Among them, the raw materials industry is required to grow at a faster rate, such as raw coal, which is expected to increase by 37.1%. Gold, which was not included in the national plan before this year, is planned to be mined at 11,600 taels this year. Another important task is to actively trial-produce and manufacture various agricultural machinery, such as gas engines, diesel engines, sugar-making machinery, ramie stripping machines, and various pumping, drainage, and irrigation machinery and equipment. In order to promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year and in the next few years, the province is vigorously exploring local financial potential and reducing administrative expenditure on the basis of the basic construction investment figures allocated by the central government, thereby expanding the scale of basic construction. The total number of fiscal appropriations for the whole year is about 200 million yuan, which is twice that of 1957 and the most since liberation. In addition to the continued construction projects invested in the first five-year plan, the investment in agricultural fertilizer, pesticide industry and raw materials industry directly related to agricultural production has been greatly increased, such as the establishment of two modern chemical fertilizer plants (Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant and Zhanjiang Phosphate Fertilizer Plant), electrolytic salt plants, and steel plants. Sixteen new sugar factories throughout the province will also be put into production this year.

### 挖财力　靠群众　大办地方工业  广东提高工业增长速度扩大基本建设规模

    挖财力　靠群众　大办地方工业
    广东提高工业增长速度扩大基本建设规模
    本报广州29日电　中共广东省委最近作出了决定，要求全省各地在继续推进农业生产高潮的同时，要立即克服工业方面的落后状态，让工业也来个大跃进。
    省委要求各专区、市、县，各厂矿企业和手工业合作社，都必须在克服右倾保守思想的基础上，规定出自己的先进的争取工业大跃进的计划，并首先制订先进的1958年度的生产计划和指标，保证超额完成省计划委员会规定的1958年工业产值增长速度15％的指标，力求达到和超过1956年增长22％的速度。
    最近召开的一次省计划会议，已将原订1958年工业总产值比1957年增长11％的速度提高为15％。其中以原材料工业要求增长的速度较快，如原煤增长37.1％。在今年以前没有列入国家计划的黄金，今年计划开采一万一千六百两。另一项重要任务是积极试制和制造各种农具机械，如煤气机、柴油机、制糖机械、剥麻机和各种抽水、排灌机械设备等。为了促进今年和今后几年的工农业生产大跃进，在中央分配的基本建设投资数字的基础上，全省大力发掘地方财政潜力和削减行政经费支出，因而扩大了基本建设的规模。全年财政拨款总数约二亿元，相当于1957年的两倍，是解放以来最多的一年。除投放在第一个五年计划的续建项目外，大大增加了与农业生产直接有关的农肥、农药工业和原材料工业的投资，如建立两座现代化的化学肥料厂（广州氮肥厂和湛江磷肥厂）、电解盐厂、钢铁厂等，今年全省还将有十六座新建的糖厂投入生产。
