    Drops of Water Form a River

    Amidst the anti-waste campaign, we have heard heartening news: Over the past year, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has saved a large amount of materials and funds for the country.

    Why is the People's Liberation Army able to save so much and achieve such great results? Upon closer examination, there is no particular secret; it is simply because they have implemented a method of mobilizing everyone and starting with small things, thus turning trickles into rivers, accumulating countless small achievements into great achievements.

    Uniforms are worn out, returned to receive new ones. This is nothing special for an individual, and it is also very reasonable. However, just this item alone allowed the entire army to turn in more than seven million jin of old cotton and old cloth last year. Rubber-soled shoes are worn out, and some people throw them away casually, but when gathered together, they yield as much as 250,000 jin of shoe soles. When people leave, the lights are turned off, and large light bulbs are replaced with small ones. In this way, five units in Beijing alone saved more than 400,000 watts of electricity. These facts show that as long as we pay attention, many places can be economical.

    We often say: aim high, start small. This is even more necessary for saving. If one person saves one or two liang of grain a day, the whole country can save six hundred million liang, nearly forty million jin. If one person uses one less chi of cloth, the whole country can save six million pi. Small savings can add up to a lot, so we cannot look down on small savings. We are not afraid that savings are small, but that we do not do it; we are not afraid that savings are little, but that not everyone takes action.

    Starting with small savings, of course, does not mean advocating relaxing savings in big aspects. It is naturally very good to be able to save in big aspects. However, if we only have great ambitions and turn a blind eye to the small wastes at hand, we may vow to save all year long and end up with nothing. Moreover, even if we can achieve savings in big aspects, small savings should not be relaxed either.

    Gathering drops of water to form a river, this concept should be貫穿[貫穿 is retained as is] throughout all aspects of the saving campaign. Because its effect has been fully demonstrated in the saving achievements of the People's Liberation Army.

    滴水成河
    在反浪费声中，我们听到了可喜的消息：去年一年来，中国人民解放军为国家节约了大批的物资和经费。
    人民解放军为什么能够节约得这样多，成绩这样大？细细考察，其中并没有什么特别的奥妙，只是因为实行了人人动员，小处入手的办法，因而涓滴成河，汇无数小成绩而为大成绩。
    服装穿旧了，缴旧的然后领新的，这在个人来说，不算什么，而且也很合理。但仅就这一项，全军去年就上缴旧棉旧布共七百多万斤。胶底鞋穿破了，有些人顺手扔掉，但汇集起来，就缴鞋底二十五万斤之多。人走灯灭，大灯泡换成小灯泡，这样，仅北京五个单位就节约用电四十多万瓦。这些事实说明，只要注意起来，很多地方都可以节约。
    我们常说：大处着眼，小处入手。这对节约，更是需要。一人一天节约一两粮食，全国就能节约六亿两，近四千万斤。一人少用一尺布，全国就能节约六百万匹。积少可以成多，不能看不起小的节约。不怕节约小，怕的是不去做；不怕节约少，就怕不是人人动手。
    节约从小处入手，当然不是主张放松大的方面的节约。能在大的方面有所节约，自然非常好。但是，如果空怀大志，对眼前手边的小浪费熟视无睹，可能整年发誓节约，到头来一无所获。而且，即或在大的方面能有节约，小的节约也是不应该放松的。
    聚滴水成河流，这个观念应该贯穿在各方面的节约行动中。因为它的效果已经在人民解放军的节约成绩中充分表现出来。
