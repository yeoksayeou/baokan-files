Establishing "Experimental Fields," Improving Leadership, and Promoting Production
The "Cadre Workface" of Heshan Coal Mine in Guangxi Initially Shows its Effectiveness

    (Our dispatch) According to the Guangxi Daily: Since late November of last year, the leading personnel of the East Mine of Heshan Coal Mine, during the rectification campaign, based on the suggestions of the employees, established a "cadre workface" as a place for cadres to become familiar with production technology, discover problems in production, propose suggestions for improving work, and demonstrate and promote various advanced experiences. Although this workface has not been established for long, it has already had a significant effect on improving leadership work and promoting production development.
    A total of forty cadres participated in the production of this workface, divided into two shifts, with the mine director and the party branch secretary serving as shift leaders respectively, extracting four to six hours on Fridays or Saturdays to go down the mine to dig coal. From drilling and blasting to pillar support and transportation, the entire coal mining process is undertaken by cadres.
    In the past, many cadres only learned about the production situation from summary reports and meetings. Even if they went down the mine, they often only made a cursory inspection. Young cadres were even less familiar with production. Some people had been at the mine for several years and still did not know how coal was mined. When talking to workers, they always felt a lack of "common language" and were incompatible. During the first labor session, everyone spent a lot of effort to dig a cart of coal. Just as they were about to push it out, it was rejected by the coal collector because some cadres could not distinguish between coal and gangue. As a result, large pieces of stone were also loaded onto the cart as coal. The coal collector explained the identification method of coal and gangue on the spot, and everyone re-selected the stones. Through this lesson, the cadres further realized the necessity of participating in labor and thoroughly transforming themselves. Therefore, many people have made plans or wrote letters of determination to the mine leaders, striving to basically master the complete set of coal mining techniques within a few months or a year, and to train themselves into all-round cadres who are both literate and martial.
    After more than a month of training, the cadres have gradually become accustomed to underground operations, have initially mastered the skills of coal mining, and have been able to put forward some practical suggestions for improving production management. For example, the pre-shift meeting is a production system that has been implemented for a long time in this mine. The meeting content mainly includes issuing daily production tasks and necessary measures, three shifts a day, once per shift. In the past, very few leaders participated in this meeting. After participating in labor, the cadres and workers assigned shifts together, and found that the pre-shift meeting lacked preparation, took too long, and the area cadres did not issue specific tasks. For example, safety, quality, and other routine problems, without combining specific materials, had to be talked about for a long time every time a shift was assigned. The meeting could not be concluded in ten or twenty minutes, so that the workers who were about to leave work could not leave on time, and the workers who were about to go to work could not go to work on time. In response to this problem, in addition to proposing improvement methods at daily meetings, mine directors and other leading cadres also plan to spend a certain amount of time personally assigning shifts and specifically helping grassroots production cadres improve the quality of pre-shift meetings. The phenomenon of car derailment in the transportation area has not been properly resolved for a long time. In the past, everyone thought it was because the road was bad. After the cadres participated in labor, after research and experimentation, they found that the derailment of the car was a technical problem of the workers. For example, when the car reached a bend or a triangular fork, the center of gravity shifted to the side. Because the workers did not pay attention and pushed too hard, the car tilted to one side, which easily derailed. If you pay attention to the center of gravity of the car when turning, it will pass smoothly. Several experiences have now been summarized and widely promoted among rail transport workers throughout the mine. Other management issues, such as why the mid-shift meeting lacks content, and why the specifications of the workface do not meet the technical regulations, are being studied and resolved. The responsible comrades of this mine plan to fix the "cadre workface" from this year, and implement regular operations in each process, so that the roof, floor, single pillar, wooden pile, etc. of the workface meet the specifications. They also want to use this workface as a testing ground for promoting various advanced experiences, and organize workers to visit it, so as to play a demonstration role.

### 建立“试验田”　改进领导　推动生产  广西合山煤矿“干部工作面”初露锋芒

    建立“试验田”　改进领导　推动生产
    广西合山煤矿“干部工作面”初露锋芒
    本报讯　据广西日报报道：从去年11月下旬起，合山煤矿东矿场领导人员，在整风中，根据职工的建议，建立了一个“干部工作面”，作为干部熟悉生产技术，发现生产中的问题，提出改进工作的意见，示范推广各种先进经验的场所。这个工作面虽然创立的时间不久，但对改进领导工作，推动生产的发展，已经有了显著的作用。
    参加这个工作面生产的共有四十名干部，分为两班，由矿场主任和党总支书记分别任班长，在星期五或星期六抽出四至六小时进井挖煤。从打眼放炮到支柱运输，整个采煤过程全部由干部担任。
    以前，许多干部只是从总结表报和会议上了解生产情况，有时虽然也进井，但往往是走马观花。青年干部对生产更不熟悉，有些人到矿好几年，还不知道煤是怎么挖出来的，跟工人谈起来，总觉得缺乏“共同语言”，格格不入。第一次劳动时，大家费了好大劲才挖出一车煤，正要往外推时，遭到收煤员拒收，原来是有些干部分不清什么是煤，什么是?，结果把大块石头也当作煤装上车。收煤员当场给大家讲解煤?的鉴别法，大家才又重新选出石头。通过这一课，干部们更进一步认识到参加劳动、彻底改造自己的必要。因此，许多人都订出计划或写了决心书给矿场领导，争取在几个月或一年内，基本上掌握采煤过程的全套技术，把自己锻炼成一个文武双全的干部。
    经一个多月的锻炼，干部们已逐渐习惯了井下作业，初步掌握了采煤的本领，并且能够提出一些切合实际的改进生产管理的意见。例如，班前会，是这个矿场执行已久的生产制度，会议内容主要是下达当天生产任务和必要措施，每天三班，每班一次。过去领导干部极少参加这个会。参加劳动以后，干部和工人在一起派班，就发现班前会缺乏准备，时间过长，工区干部下达任务不具体。比如安全、质量等经常性的问题，不结合具体材料，每次派班都要讲上老半天。会议不能在十多二十分钟结束，使要下班的工人不能按时出?，要上班的工人不能按时上班。针对这个问题，领导上除了在日常会上提出改进办法外，矿场主任等领导干部还打算分别抽出一定时间，亲自派班，具体帮助基层生产干部提高班前会的质量。运输工区的车斗脱轨现象，长期没有得到妥善解决。过去大家都认为是路不好。干部参加劳动后，经过研究、试验，发现车斗脱轨是工人的技术问题。比如，车斗每到拐弯或三角叉路时，重心旁移，由于工人不注意，推得过猛，车斗向一边倾斜，容易脱轨。如果在拐弯的时候注意车斗重心，就会平稳通过。现在已总结出几条经验，在全矿场轨运工中普遍推广。其他如班中会为什么缺乏内容，工作面的规格为什么不合乎技术规程等管理问题，都正在研究解决。这个矿场的负责同志准备从今年起，把“干部工作面”固定下来，在每个工序中实行正规作业，使工作面的顶板、地板、单柱、木垛等合乎规格。他们还要把这个工作面作为推广各种先进经验的试验场，组织工人参观，以便起到示范的作用。
