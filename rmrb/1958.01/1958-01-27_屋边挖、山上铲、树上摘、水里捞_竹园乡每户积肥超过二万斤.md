    Digging Around Houses, Shoveling on Mountains, Picking from Trees, Scooping from Water
    Zhuyuan Township Exceeds 20,000 Jin of Fertilizer Accumulation Per Household

    (Our Dispatch) To realize the great leap forward in agriculture, Zhuyuan Township in Jingyan County, Sichuan Province, has broken through the "ten thousand jin of fertilizer" accumulation plan per household, and has accumulated more than 80 million jin of various natural fertilizers, averaging more than 20,000 jin of fertilizer per household. One cooperative in the township has reached 80,000 jin per household, and seven cooperatives have reached 30,000 jin per household.
    While building water conservancy projects and processing land, the township seized the opportunity to focus on fertilizer accumulation. The methods are: First, reason and calculate carefully. The township calculated the fertilizer production increase from the perspective of promoting the great leap forward in production: last year, an average of 3,000 jin of fertilizer was applied per mu, and the yield was 491 jin of grain per mu; this year, to achieve a yield of 800 jin per mu, the township needs more than 200 million jin of fertilizer. Apart from the existing 100 million jin, there is still a shortage of more than 80 million jin. After everyone's discussion, the slogan "1000 jin of grain per mu, 10,000 jin of fertilizer needed, everyone involved, 32,000 per household" was put forward. Second, find fertilizer sources. Mobilizing the vast number of cooperative members to dig around houses, shovel on mountains, pick from trees, and scoop from water, they found a large amount of fertilizer, breaking the saying that "no fertilizer can be accumulated." Third, unify the arrangement of labor and solve specific problems. The township established a Fertilizer Accumulation Committee, and each cooperative allocated 35% of its labor force to the committee for unified deployment, and reasonably solved problems such as fertilizer accumulation work point quotas and fertilizer source planning. Fourth, secretaries took the lead, level by level, and launched appraisals and competitions. The ten township cadres in the township, led by the secretary and township head, have already accumulated more than 120,000 jin of fertilizer. When digging old wall mud and stove-side soil, Party members, Youth League members, and activists first dug their own and then the masses', breaking superstitious ideas. Cooperative members commented well: "The great leap forward in agricultural production must have a revolutionary spirit!" (Rao Xuecheng)

    屋边挖、山上铲、树上摘、水里捞
    竹园乡每户积肥超过二万斤
    本报讯　为实现农业大跃进，四川井研县竹园乡突破了每户“万斤肥”的积肥计划，已积各种自然肥料八千多万斤，平均每户积肥二万斤以上。全乡有一个社达到每户八万斤，有七个社每户三万斤。
    这个乡在兴修水利、土地加工的同时，适时地抓紧了积肥工作。办法是：一、讲道理、算细账。全乡从促进生产大跃进的角度，算了一笔肥料增产账：去年平均每亩施肥三千斤，亩产粮食四百九十一斤；今年要实现亩产八百斤，全乡就需肥料二亿多斤，除已有的一亿多斤，尚差八千多万斤，经过大家讨论，提出了“亩产千斤粮，要施万斤肥，人人齐动手，每户三万二”的积肥口号。二、找肥源。动员广大社员向屋边挖、山上铲、树上摘、水里捞，找出了大量的肥料，打破了“无肥可积”的说法。三、统一安排劳力，解决具体问题。乡成立了积造肥料委员会，各社以35％的劳力归委员会统一调配，并合理解决了积肥工分定额、肥源规划等问题。四、书记动手、层层带头、展开评比竞赛。全乡十个乡干部，在书记、乡长亲自带领下，已积肥十二万多斤。在挖老墙泥、灶边土时，党、团员和积极分子都先挖自己的，后挖群众的，破除了迷信思想。社员议论的好：“农业生产大跃进，硬要有股革命劲！”　（饶学诚）
