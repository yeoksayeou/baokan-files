Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 19th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Meng Fan): The Tianjin Steel Plant No. 4 Branch has adopted a comparative method to lead production across its three shifts, prompting advanced shifts to continuously improve and lagging shifts to catch up, resulting in an overall surge in production.

In 1957, the total output of coiled steel from the three shifts exceeded the state plan by 10%, and the qualified product rate reached over 99%. All four cost indicators—coal consumption, electricity consumption, burn loss, and head trimming—were also lower than planned. The three rolling mill shifts progressed almost in lockstep, with output and quality indicators exceeding quotas every month; the difference in output between shifts was only a fraction of a percentage point. Among them, Shift A had consistently been the advanced shift, with the highest output and quality indicators. However, Shift B shed its backward status and caught up, showing the most rapid progress, while Shift C achieved the best results in cost indicators such as burn loss and electricity consumption.

Since 1953, Shift A had been an advanced production shift. This shift not only had high output and quality but also a strong spirit of unity and mutual assistance among its workers, and it had been selected as an advanced unit in industry competitions in Tianjin or even nationally for iron and steel factories. Although Shift C's production was not as high as Shift A's, it was able to follow Shift A's development and rise. The most backward was Shift B. When formulating the annual plan each year, Shift B was key; during the execution of the plan, Shift B's failure to complete the plan affected the entire factory, and again, was key.

Shift B's backward situation caused great distress to the factory leadership. It was not until the advanced producer movement began in 1956 that they found an effective method of using comparisons to help the backward through the advanced. The leadership first identified two main reasons for Shift B's backwardness through a comparison of the three shifts. The first reason was that the shift foreman lacked leadership experience; problems that arose during production could not be resolved in a timely manner, and there was more criticism than concrete help for the workers, leading to a lack of confidence. The weakness of Shift B's shift foreman was precisely the strength of Shifts A and C. The foremen of these two shifts had good relationships with the masses and were able to unite the group leaders, Party members, and activists around them to form a leadership core. When problems arose, they worked with the workers to find the causes, told the workers how to solve them, and paid attention to follow-up inspections. The second reason was that the operational skills of Shift B's workers were not as good as those of Shifts A and C. In particular, many defective products were produced on the second and third rolling mills due to the improper installation angles of the pipes and guides, a phenomenon rarely seen in Shifts A and C.

After analysis and comparison, the leadership put forward the slogan of promoting the working class's spirit of unity and mutual assistance and strongly supporting Shift B at cadre meetings and Party member meetings. The workers of Shift A were the first to respond to this call. During shift changes, the workers of Shift A helped the workers of Shift B to correctly install guides, collars, and pipes, and only left the workshop after production was normal. When the supply of new groove holes was insufficient, the workers of Shift A used old groove holes for production, leaving the new groove holes for Shift B to use. When the workers of Shift C discovered problems in Shift B's production, they also took the initiative to offer suggestions to help Shift B improve its operations. The workers of Shift B also pledged to learn from Shifts A and C. They arrived early and left late, and even went to the workshop on public holidays to observe the operations of the workers of Shifts A and C. They also made suggestions to help improve the shortcomings they found in the operations of these two shifts. The shift foremen of the three shifts also engaged in unity and mutual assistance. As a result of the collective spirit displayed by the workers of the three shifts, the operational skills of the workers of Shift B improved, the leadership strength was strengthened, and production gradually increased. By the fourth quarter of 1957, both output and quality had exceeded Shift C and were approaching Shift A. In early January of this year, a new factory record of 18.89 tons of output per shift was created.

The success of improving Shift B made the leadership even more aware of the benefits of implementing the comparative method. They developed a scheduling diary to compare the completion of various indicators for each shift every day. There was also an analysis of the production situation of the three shifts every week and every half-month. In addition, the scheduling meetings held every day allowed for the timely discovery of advanced experiences in the production of the three shifts. For key problems common to the three shifts, the factory leadership relied on the wisdom of the masses to solve them, using the form of professional meetings.

    天津钢厂四分厂采用比较法领导生产
    督促落后的奋起直追先进的更先进
    据新华社天津19日电　新华社记者孟帆报道：天津钢厂四分厂采用比较法领导三班生产，促使先进班不断前进，落后班奋起直追，形成了生产的全面高涨。
    1957年三个班的盘条总产量超过国家计划10％，合格品率达到99％以上；煤耗、电耗、烧损和截头四项成本指标，也全部比计划降低。三个轧钢班几乎是齐头并进，产量和质量指标全都月月超额完成，各班产量高低相差不过百分之零点几。其中，甲班一直是先进班，产量和质量指标最高；可是乙班摆脱了落后的地位赶上来，进步最快；而丙班的烧损、电耗等成本指标，是完成得最好的。
    从1953年以来，甲班就是先进的生产班。这个班不仅产量和质量高，而且班内工人的团结互助精神也好，曾经几次当选为天津市或全国钢铁工厂同行业竞赛的先进单位。丙班的生产情况虽然不及甲班，可是能够跟随甲班的发展而上升。最落后的是乙班。每年制订全年计划的时候，乙班是关键；执行计划中，乙班完不成计划而影响全厂，又是关键。
    乙班的落后状况使工厂的领导方面十分苦恼，直到1956年开展先进生产者运动以后，才找到了通过评比以先进帮助落后的有效方法。领导方面首先从三班情况的对比中，找出乙班落后的主要原因有两个。第一个原因，是值班主任的领导经验不足，生产中出现的问题不能及时解决，对于工人批评多，具体帮助少，工人信心不足。乙班值班主任的弱点，恰恰是甲、丙两班的长处。这两个班的值班主任同群众的关系搞得好，并且能够把班内的组长、党员和积极分子团结在自己周围形成领导核心。他们遇事和工人一起找原因，告诉工人解决的办法，事后又注意检查。第二个原因，是乙班工人的岗位操作技术不如甲、丙两班。特别是在二排和三排轧钢机上，管子和导板的角度安装不合适发生许多废品，而甲、丙两班就很少有这种现象。
    经过分析和比较，领导方面就在干部会议和党员大会上，提出了发扬工人阶级团结互助精神、大力支持乙班的口号。首先响应这个号召的是甲班的工人们。在交班的时候，甲班的工人们都按岗位帮助乙班工人正确安装导板、围盘和管子，直到开车后生产正常，才离开车间。当新槽孔供应不足的时候，甲班工人们就用旧槽孔生产，把新槽孔留给乙班用。丙班工人发现乙班生产中的问题，也主动提出意见帮助乙班改进操作。乙班工人也提出了向甲、丙班学习的保证。他们早来晚走，甚至在公休日也到车间观摩甲、丙两班工人的操作。他们发现这两班工人操作的缺点，也同样提出建议帮助改进。三班的值班主任也进行团结互助。由于三班工人发挥了集体主义精神，乙班工人的岗位操作技术提高了，领导力量也加强了，生产就逐渐提高。到1957年的第四季，产量和质量都已超过了丙班而接近了甲班。今年1月上旬，又创造了班产量十八点八九吨的全厂新纪录。
    提高乙班的成效，使领导方面更加体会到实行比较法的好处。他们制订了一种调度日记，每天比较各班的各项指标完成情况；每周、每半月还有三班生产情况的分析；再加上每天召开的调度会议，就可以随时发现三班生产中的先进经验。对于三班共同存在的关键问题，这个厂的领导方面都是依靠群众的智慧加以解决，采取的形式是专业会议。
