    A New Factory Built in Forty Days
    By our reporters Xi Ping and Ji Yin

    On a quiet street in the western district of Shanghai, a new factory was born two months ago – the Simei Advanced Glass Fiber Factory. This is no ordinary new factory, but the first seedling of China's very promising advanced glass fiber industry. People who come to visit this factory initially assume that such an advanced, new-type factory must have taken a long time and a huge investment to build. But when they come here and learn the truth, they are all surprised to find that the entire construction time of this new factory was only forty days, and the state spent only 185,000 yuan in investment to complete the construction of this first domestic advanced glass fiber factory and put it into production. This investment can be fully recovered and more after only half a year of production.

    How did the comrades who built the Simei Advanced Glass Fiber Factory use a relatively small price – forty days and a little over 100,000 yuan investment – to exchange for this new-type factory with more than 100 workers and five workshops? This question has aroused the interest and attention of many comrades in Shanghai. Recently, we visited this new factory with this question. During the two-day interview, we found the answer to this question, which is: run enterprises diligently and thriftily. The construction process of this new factory profoundly proves this truth: "Only through diligence and thrift can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results," "Only through diligence and thrift can we solve the contradiction between construction and poverty and blankness."

    The Primary Problem is Filling the Blank
    Before the establishment of the Simei Advanced Glass Fiber Factory, the advanced glass fiber industry was a blank page in our country, a virgin land waiting to be reclaimed.

    The advanced glass fiber industry is a new industry that emerged after World War II. It uses ordinary glass (inorganic glass) as raw material and draws it into glass filaments that are finer than silkworm silk (only five microns in diameter), then combines them into threads or weaves them into cloth and tape. This kind of glass cloth, silk, and tape has many advantages such as high heat resistance, strong electrical insulation performance, not easy to corrode, and strong tensile strength. It is an important material for modern electromechanical, aviation, shipbuilding, and other industries. Using it to wrap generators and motors can greatly reduce the size of the machine while making it more efficient. Mixing glass cloth with plastic can be pressed into various tough "glass steel plates" to be used as the outer shells of airplanes, automobiles, and ships. A glass rope the thickness of a matchstick can lift a motorcycle weighing eighty kilograms. Advanced glass fiber has a very wide range of uses on the one hand, and on the other hand, its raw material is quartz (glass raw material), which is very cheap and very easy to obtain, so there is absolutely no need to worry about the lack of raw materials. However, before November 15th last year, there was no formal factory for this new industry in our country. The large amount of advanced glass fiber used by industrial and defense departments was all imported from abroad.

    In October last year, the Shanghai industrial sector formally successfully trial-produced advanced glass fiber. After the first bundle of white, soft, and qualified advanced glass fiber was sent from the laboratory to the leading organs, the leadership realized that the first experimental factory must be built immediately at the fastest speed to bring the research results into actual production, so as to fill this blank spot in China's modern industry as quickly as possible. How to speed up the construction of the factory? The only way is to run the factory diligently and thriftily. The comrade in charge of this work told us: Only by running the factory diligently and thriftily can we achieve speed, and only then can we achieve good quality and quantity. This principle was very concrete for them at the time. Taking the factory's investment as an example, they could have asked the state for several hundred million or even several billion yuan in investment to build a beautiful new factory, but doing so would not only be wasteful, but also greatly delay the factory's construction speed. Because the investment figure is large, the local area would be unable to bear it and would involve the allocation of central construction investment (besides, the basic construction of this factory was not originally included in the 1957 plan). In this way, it is likely that it could not be resolved for a year and a half. Now they have used a little over 100,000 yuan in investment, the figure is small, and it is much easier to solve, so the factory can start construction quickly.

    New Workshops in Old Factory Buildings
    The factory comrades took us to visit their factory buildings. We originally thought that this factory would definitely have a set of brand-new factory buildings and equipment consistent with its resounding name, but the result was that all the factory buildings that appeared before our eyes were a few ordinary brick-wood structure bungalows squeezed in a small alley, as well as some old and short buildings, without the magnificent architecture of newly built factories that we often see elsewhere. Comrade Wan, who took us on the tour, told us: This used to be the old factory building of the Zhanghua Wool Spinning Factory. The houses were already dilapidated, and because the terrain was low, water often accumulated, and the corners of the walls were also rotten. In order to run the factory diligently and thriftily and speed up the construction speed, they obtained this old factory building from the Textile Administration Bureau, repaired it, patched the leaking roof, raised the low ground by 50 centimeters, and demolished and repaired the walls. It only took more than 40,000 yuan and more than a month to renovate this 1,000-square-meter old factory building, just like a newly built one. He said that if this piece of factory building had been completely demolished and rebuilt at that time, or a new factory building had been built elsewhere, it would have taken at least several months and cost tens of thousands of yuan more in investment.

    What surprised us was that this new factory not only utilized old factory buildings, but even many of the machines and equipment were old. Except for the 40 drawing machines in the drawing workshop, which were newly manufactured, the entire factory only bought a new lathe in the metalworking workshop. The rest, such as the doubling machines, weaving machines, tape weaving machines, winding machines, etc., were all some dilapidated machines transferred from textile factories and warehouses. The remaining processes of glass fiber production other than drawing, such as plying, weaving, etc., are somewhat similar to those of textile factories, so these old machines, after being disassembled, washed, and partially modified, were put to new use. In the workshop, we saw these machines all wiped clean and shiny, performing new tasks: some were plying threads, some were weaving glass fiber tapes, and a loud machine noise vibrated happily in the workshop. Comrade Wan pointed to two machines that were automatically winding glass fiber tubes with a clattering sound and said to us: "This machine is pretty good, right? But when it was first transferred here, it was simply too dirty to look at." She said that after these two old cars were transferred here, the factory's engineer Cheng and the master workers in the metalworking workshop disassembled and washed them for a whole week. In order to match parts and modify them, they put in a lot of effort to get them to look like they do now. She pointed to the two large doubling machines on the side and told us that these were 1932 Japanese-made spinning machines. Because the machines had problems and could not be used, they had been lying in the warehouse of the Shanghai Textile Administration Bureau for many years. Unexpectedly, this machine that could not spin yarn is now spinning much finer glass fibers.

    Is it normal for a new factory to use so many old machines? We asked engineer Cheng Weimin, who is in charge of technical work. He said: The factory's practice of fully utilizing old machines is completely correct. The advanced glass fiber industry is a new industry in our country. The current machines have all been initially explored in the laboratory. They are not yet finalized and need to be continuously improved in future actual production. The task of their factory is to carry out small-batch production on the one hand, and continuously accumulate technical experience and improve technology on the other hand, so as to create conditions for the construction of large factories in the future. Therefore, modifying old machines for production is both fast and economical. Facts have also proved that these old machines are running very well.

    More Importantly is Creation
    The greatest feature and main contribution of this new factory in implementing diligence and thrift in running enterprises is not the use of old factory buildings and old machines, but the major innovation of production technology through creative labor. One of the decisive innovations was solving the problem of crucibles for melting glass.

    The crucible is the key to developing the advanced glass fiber industry. The melting point of advanced glass is as high as 1,500 degrees Celsius. Foreign factories have always used high-heat-resistant platinum crucibles. Buying a platinum crucible costs 40,000 yuan. The cost for just crucibles for their forty drawing machines alone would require an investment of 1.6 million yuan. So how much would it cost to build this factory? Moreover, the number of advanced glass fiber factories that our country needs to build is definitely not just a few, so how much investment will be needed in the future? In order to break through this key problem, engineer Cheng Weimin traveled around, consulted scientists and workers, and finally found a way to make crucibles with pottery clay, which only costs two jiao per crucible. The success of this research not only saved the factory more than 1 million yuan in investment, enabling the factory to be built smoothly, but also solved a major key problem for the future development of China's advanced glass fiber industry.

    This kind of creative labor in the implementation of diligence and thrift in running enterprises in this factory is also reflected in many other things within the factory. In order to save a few kilograms of mercury for the pressure gauge, they tried every possible means to make an oil pressure gauge with half a kilogram of petroleum to replace the expensive mercury. In order to save imported electrical insulation material "Hong Fan Bai," they rack their brains to make wire winding tubes by painting varnish on cardboard. In order to save copper pipes, they bought tap water pipes, coated them with red copper and nickel to replace them... All these saving methods are not simple copying, but were achieved after hard thinking. Indeed, diligence and thrift in running enterprises not only requires thrift, but especially requires diligence. Laziness will not work.

    Living a Careful and Thrifty Life
    This factory has a characteristic: almost all of the technicians and workers came from small factories in Shanghai's alleyways. Today, although they have entered a large factory, they still maintain the thrifty and frugal style of living a careful and thrifty life in small factories. They always try to save as much as possible in their work and pay great attention to the utilization of waste materials. Therefore, traces of the utilization of waste materials can be found everywhere in the factory: the belt pulleys on the plying machines are all turned from old hardwood, the paper tubes for winding wires on the tube car are second-hand goods bought for five cents each, the pulley on the drawing machine is turned from a piece of old cloth-grain bakelite, and the clock face hanging on the wall for calculating the feeding time is a waste product from the telephone factory for three mao each...

    Comrade Yang from the workshop told us that the comrades in their factory have a habit: when purchasing parts and materials, they always go to the second-hand market first. What can't they find in the hundreds of thousands of all-encompassing second-hand markets in Shanghai? Hardware parts, electrical materials, there is really everything, and sometimes they can buy good quality things at very low prices. Only when they really can't buy suitable things in the second-hand market do they go to the hardware stores on Nanjing Road.

    The second-hand market has indeed solved many problems for them. For example, when they were assembling the drawing machine, a small pulley had to be installed on the machine. It would be best to make this pulley out of bakelite, but if it was sent to a bakelite factory to make, a separate mold would have to be pressed. The number of pulleys was small, and the price would be very expensive. Moreover, it would take a considerable amount of time from ordering to delivery. Later, they went to the second-hand stalls in the City God Temple and bought a broken mahogany table leg and turned it into dozens of small pulleys, which worked very well. When they were modifying the plying machine, the technical regulations stipulated that there should be a layer of rubber on the outside of the roller. Ordering new ones would be expensive and slow, so they went to the second-hand stalls and bought an old rickshaw tire, cut it into rubber rings, and put it on the roller, which was just right. ... There are many such things in their factory. The second-hand market has simply become a raw material warehouse that can solve many problems for them. Of course, they still use new materials where new materials should be used.

    This kind of scattered but widespread saving is also an important factor in the factory's fast and economical construction.

    After we visited the factory building, when we returned to the workshop office, there were several people surrounding the table, repeatedly pondering the two tubes of finished glass fiber products on the table. Engineer Cheng Weimin saw us come in, picked up a beautifully decorated tube of glass fiber and said to us: "This is a product of the British Fiberglas Limited, our factory has decided to challenge them, and we will catch up with them in terms of the quality and variety of advanced glass fiber within three to six years." He said that although their factory has only been established for more than two months, the output has doubled and the fineness has reached seven microns, only two microns different from the British product. They also plan to trial-produce ten new products such as glass skin, glass silk, and glass steel in the next three years.

    The vitality of new things is always particularly strong. We believe that the comrades of the Simei Advanced Glass Fiber Factory will definitely be able to realize all their wishes.

    四十天建成的一座新工厂
    本报记者　习平  季音
    在上海市西区一条静僻的马路边，两个月前诞生了一家新工厂——斯美高级玻璃纤维厂。这不是一座普通的新工厂，而是我国极有发展前途的高级玻璃纤维工业的第一颗幼芽。前来访问这家工厂的人们，起初都以为像这样一座高级的新型工厂，一定是花了很长时间与巨额投资才建设起来的。但当他们来到这里了解了真象以后，不觉都吃了一惊，原来这座新工厂的全部建设时间只有四十天，国家仅仅花了十八万五千元投资，就把这国内第一座高级玻璃纤维厂建设完成并且开始生产了。这笔投资只要生产半年之后就可以全部收回而有余。
    建设斯美高级玻璃纤维厂的同志是怎样用一个比较小的代价——四十天时间和十多万元投资，换取到这座拥有一百多工人、五个车间的新型工厂的呢？这个问题，引起了上海不少同志的兴趣和注意。日前，我们就带着这个问题访问了这座新工厂。在两天的采访中，我们找到了这个问题的答案，这就是：勤俭办企业。这个新工厂的建设过程深刻地证明了这个真理：“只有勤俭，才能实现多、快、好、省”，“只有勤俭，才能解决建设和一穷二白的矛盾”。
    首要问题是把空白填起来
    在斯美高级玻璃纤维厂建成之前，高级玻璃纤维工业在我国是一页空白，一块等待开垦的处女地。
    高级玻璃纤维工业是二次世界大战以后新兴的一种工业，它用普通玻璃（无机玻璃）作原料，拉成比蚕丝还要细得多的玻璃丝（直径只有五微米），然后并成线，或织成布与带。这种玻璃布、丝和带，具有耐高热、电气绝缘性能强、不易腐蚀、拉抗力强等许多优点，是近代机电、航空、造船等工业的重要材料，用它来包扎发电机、电动机，就可以大大缩小机器的体积，而效力更高。把玻璃布用塑胶混合可以压制成各种坚韧的“玻璃钢板”，作为飞机、汽车、轮船的外壳。一根火柴梗粗细的玻璃绳，可以吊起一部八十公斤重的摩托车。高级玻璃纤维一方面用途非常广泛，另方面它的原料就是价格极低、非常容易取得的石英（玻璃原料），完全不用耽忧原料的缺乏。但是，这个新工业在去年11月15日以前，在我国还没有一个正式的工厂，工业部门、国防部门所采用的大量高级玻璃纤维，都是从国外进口的。
    去年10月间，上海工业部门正式试制成功了高级玻璃纤维。当第一束洁白柔软、合乎规格的高级玻璃丝从试验室送到领导机关之后，领导上就意识到：必须以最快的速度立即建设起第一个实验性的工厂，把研究的成果拿到实际生产中去，以便尽可能快的把我国近代工业中的这个空白点填补起来。怎样加快工厂的建设速度呢？唯一的道路就是勤俭办厂。经办这个工作的同志对我们说：只有勤俭办厂才能达到快，也才能达到好与多，这个道理当时对他们来说是非常具体的。拿工厂的投资来说，他们尽可以向国家要几百以至几千万元的投资来建设一个漂漂亮亮的新工厂，但这样做不但浪费，而且工厂建设速度势必要大大推迟。因为投资数字大，地方上就无力负担，就要牵涉到中央建设投资的分配（何况这个厂的基本建设本来就未列入1957年计划内）。这样一来，很可能一年半载不能解决。现在他们用了十几万元投资，数字小，解决起来就容易得多，工厂就可以很快动工。
    旧厂房里的新车间
    工厂的同志带我们参观了他们的厂房。我们原以为这个工厂一定会有与它响亮的厂名相一致的一套崭新的厂房和设备，但结果出现在我们眼前的全部厂房，就是挤在一条小小的弄堂里的几间砖木结构的普通平房，以及一些旧而矮小的楼房，全然没有我们在别的地方所常见的那种新建工厂的宏伟建筑。带我们参观的万同志告诉我们：这里过去是章华毛纺厂的旧厂房，房屋本来已破旧不堪，因为地势低，经常积水，墙角也烂了。他们为了勤俭办厂，加快建设速度，就从纺织管理局要来了这幢旧厂房，作了一番修理，补了漏雨的屋顶，把低洼的地面垫高了五十公分，拆修了墙壁，只花了四万多元和一个多月时间，就把这个一千平方公尺的旧厂房翻修一新，如同新造的一般。他说，这片厂房当时如果全部拆了重建，或在别处另建新厂房，至少要耽误几个月的时间，多花十几万元的投资。
    使我们惊异的是，这个新工厂不但利用了旧厂房，连许多机器设备也是旧的。工厂里除了抽丝车间的四十部抽丝机是新制造的以外，全厂只有金工车间买过一部新车床，其余的如并丝机、织布机、织带机、卷筒机等等，全是从纺织工厂和仓库里调拨来的一些破旧机器。玻璃丝生产除了抽丝以外，余下的一些工序，如并线、织布等，和纺织厂有些接近，因此这些旧机器调来后，经过拆洗和部分改装，就派上了新用途。在车间里，我们看到这些机器一部部都被擦得乌亮，在执行着新的任务：有的在并丝，有的在织玻璃丝带，一片轰轰的机器声欢快地震荡着车间。万同志指着两部卡嚓卡嚓地在自动绕玻璃丝筒子的机器对我们说：“这机器可挺不错吧？可是刚调来的时候简直脏得不像样。”她说，这两部旧车子调来后，厂里程工程师和金工车间老师傅整整拆洗了一星期，为了配零件和改装，又花了好大的牛劲，才弄成现在这个样子。她又指着边上的两部大并线机告诉我们，这是1932年日本出品的细纱机，因为机器有毛病不能用，已在上海纺管局的仓库里躺了许多年，想不到这部不能纺纱的机器如今纺起细得多的玻璃丝来了。
    一个新工厂采用这么多旧机器，是正常的么？我们问负责技术工作的程伟民工程师。他说：他们厂里充分利用旧机器的做法是完全对的。高级玻璃纤维工业在我国是一种新工业，目前的这些机器都是在实验室里初步摸索出来的，它还不能定型，需要在今后实际生产中不断地改进。他们厂的任务，就是一方面进行小批生产，一方面不断积累技术经验，改进技术，为今后建设大厂创造条件。所以改装旧机器来生产，既做到了快，又做到了省。事实也已经证明，这些旧机器都运转得很好。
    更重要的是创造
    这个新工厂在实行勤俭办企业中的最大特色和主要贡献，并不是利用旧厂房和旧机器，而是用创造性的劳动对生产技术进行了重大的革新。其中一项决定性的革新是解决了熔解玻璃的坩锅。
    坩锅是发展高级玻璃纤维工业的关键问题。高级玻璃的熔解点高达摄氏一千五百度，国外工厂一向采用耐高热的白金坩锅。买一只白金坩锅要四万元，他们四十部抽丝机单买坩锅就得要投资一百六十万元，那么建设这个工厂得花多少钱呢？何况我们国家要建设的绝不只几个高级玻璃纤维厂，那么今后又得花多少投资呢？为了突破这个关键问题，程伟民工程师四处奔波，向科学家、工人请教，最后终于找到了用陶土做坩锅的办法，一只坩锅只消二角钱。这个研究的成功，不只是为本厂省下了一百多万元投资，使工厂能够顺利建成，而且也为今后我国高级玻璃纤维工业的发展解决了一大关键问题。
    这个工厂在实行勤俭办企业中这种创造性的劳动，还表现在厂内的其他许多事情上。他们为了节约气压表的几公斤水银，就千方百计的用一斤石油做成了油压表，代替了贵重的水银。他们为了节约进口电气绝缘材料“红反柏”，就挖空心思的用马粪纸刷上漆，做成绕丝筒子。他们为了节省铜管，就买了自来水管，涂上紫铜和镍来代替，……所有这些节约的方法，都不是简单的抄袭，而是经过了艰苦的思索才取得的。确实，勤俭办企业不但要俭，尤其要勤，懒惰是不行的。
    精打细算过日子
    这个工厂有个特点：技术人员和工人几乎全部是上海里弄小工厂里来的，今天他们虽然进了大厂，却还保持着小厂里因陋就简、精打细算过日子的勤俭作风。他们在工作中总是能省则省，非常注意废旧物料的利用，因此工厂里到处都可以找到利用废旧料的踪迹：并线机上的皮带盘都是用旧硬木车成的，筒子车上绕线的纸筒是五分钱一只买来的旧货，抽丝机上的滑轮是一块旧布纹胶木车成的，挂在墙上计算投料时间的钟面是电话机厂里三毛钱一个的废品，……
    车间杨同志告诉我们说：他们厂里的同志有一个习惯：购买零件和物料，总要先到旧货市场去转一转，数以百计的、包罗万象的上海旧货市场上，他们有什么不能找到呢？五金零件，电器材料，真是应有尽有，有时往往能以很低的价钱买到质量很好的东西。只有旧货市场上实在买不到适用的，他们才去光顾南京路上的五金商店。
    旧货市场也确实给他们解决了许多问题。例如，他们在装配抽丝机的时候，机上都要安置一个小滑轮，这个滑轮最好是用胶木做，但送到胶木厂去做要单独压一个模子，滑轮数量很少，价钱就很贵，而且从订货到交货又需要相当长的时间。后来他们就到城隍庙旧货摊买了一只破红木桌脚，把它车成了几十个小滑轮，用得很好。他们在改装并线机的时候，技术规程规定罗拉外边应有一层橡皮，去订购新的，贵而又慢，他们就到旧货摊买了一只旧人力车胎，剪成橡皮圈，套在罗拉上正合适。……这样的事情在他们厂里很多。旧货市场简直成了他们一个挺能解决问题的原材料仓库。当然，应当用新材料的地方，他们还是用新的。
    这种零星的、但是广泛的节约，也是工厂又快又省地建成的一个重要因素。
    我们参观过厂房，回到车间办公室的时候，办公室里正有几个人围着桌子在反复琢磨桌上的两筒玻璃丝成品。程伟民工程师看到我们进来，就拿起一筒装璜漂亮的玻璃丝对我们说：“这是英国发勃莱斯玻璃纤维厂的产品，我们厂已决定向他们挑战，要在三年到六年内在高级玻璃纤维的质量、品种方面赶上他们”。他说，他们厂诞生虽然还只两个多月，但是产量已提高了一倍，细度已达到七个微米，和英国产品比只差二个微米。他们还计划在今后三年内，试制出玻璃皮、玻璃绸、玻璃钢等十种新产品。
    新生事物的生命力总是特别强盛的，我们相信斯美高级玻璃纤维厂的同志一定能够实现他们的全部愿望。
