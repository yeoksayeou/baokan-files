No Need to Hire Temporary Workers During Peak Season

In Yi'an County, Heilongjiang Province, a brick factory had to hire many temporary workers every summer due to busy production. In winter, production stopped, and the workers had difficulty making ends meet, requiring state subsidies. However, in the same county, there was a grain factory that was busy in winter and idle in summer. Recently, the directors of the two factories jointly studied the issue and decided that, starting this year, grain factory workers would go to work at the brick factory in the summer, and brick factory workers would come to work at the grain factory in the winter. This way, the workers' annual income can be balanced, and the enterprises can save 23,600 yuan in temporary worker wages each year. (Liu Wenyan)

    旺季不用招临时工了
    黑龙江省依安县有个砖厂，每到夏天，生产繁忙，必须招收很多临时工；到了冬季，生产停顿，职工生活又发生困难，需要国家补助。可是这个县里，还有一个粮厂，却是冬忙夏闲。最近，两个厂的厂长共同研究，决定从今年起，夏天粮厂职工都到砖厂去工作，冬天砖厂职工都到粮厂来干活。这样职工的常年收入可以平衡，企业每年还可节约临时工工资二万三千六百元。　（刘文言）
