    An Easy-to-Understand Theoretical Article
    After reading the article "Can Shortcomings and Mistakes in Work Be Completely Avoided?" published on page 7 of your newspaper on December 28, 1957, I not only gained some theoretical knowledge and insights into methodology, but also felt a sense of intimacy and freshness because the author of this article, in explaining his views, was able to connect them to some practical issues of concern to everyone in our national life today. The issues of the apprenticeship system, private schools, and the "Five-Anti" movement discussed in this article are familiar to me and of concern to me, and coupled with the plain language, I read it in one go. I suggest that in the future, when you publish theoretical articles, you should relate them more to the actual political and social life of the country, and the language should be more accessible and concise, so that they will be more easily accepted by readers.

    一篇容易理解的理论文章
    看了你报1957年12月28日第七版登载的“工作中的缺点和错误可以完全避免吗？”一文后，不仅在理论知识和思想方法上有一定收获，而且由于这篇文章的作者在阐明自己的观点的时候，能联系当前我们国家生活中的一些人人关心的实际问题，因此，使人感到亲切、清新、容易理解。这篇文章谈到的学徒制度、私人办学、“五反”运动等问题，是我所熟悉和关心的，加上文字上平易近人，所以我一口气把它读完了。建议你报今后登载理论文章时，要多联系当前国家政治生活和社会生活的实际来谈，文字上也要通俗、简练些，这样将更容易为读者所接受。
