Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 22nd – The campaign to eliminate the four pests in Jiangxi Province has now become a mass movement with great momentum. This movement began on January 12th when 260,000 people in Nanchang City were mobilized to eliminate the four pests. Subsequently, Jiujiang City, Jingdezhen City, and Ganzhou City, under the leadership of responsible party and government cadres, organized marches of 40,000 to 50,000 people to eliminate the four pests, and the rural areas followed suit. According to statistics from nine counties and cities in the Shangrao Special District, 210,000 rats have been caught, 160,000 sparrows eliminated, 350 kilograms of pupae dug up, and 170,000 kilograms of fertilizer accumulated through sanitation efforts. In particular, in Yujiang County, each government cadre has accumulated an average of 10,100 kilograms of fertilizer, and urban residents and farmers have accumulated nearly 15,000 kilograms per person.

Currently, the problems in the campaign to eliminate the four pests are: some areas remain at the stage of general arrangements without concrete actions; some areas have generally launched the movement, but the leadership lacks determination and enthusiasm. The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee have issued instructions to all regions, requiring areas without concrete actions to quickly take action and adopt measures to catch up with advanced areas. Areas where the leadership lacks determination should immediately make a decision, boost their morale, and stand at the forefront of the movement to lead it. The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee also require government offices, factories, schools, enterprises, and street committees to organize shock brigades to eliminate the four pests with the Communist Youth League as the core; require party and government organs at all levels to strengthen the leadership of the movement, establish and improve patriotic health movement committees at all levels, rapidly carry out work, and establish inspection and reporting systems.

The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee have now made plans to basically eliminate the four pests throughout the province within seven years. This plan is: three or four years for cities, i.e., two or three years of combat and one year of mopping up; five or seven years for rural areas, i.e., four or five years of combat and one or two years of mopping up.

Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 22nd – The people of Lüda City are launching a "Eliminate the Four Pests, Promote Hygiene" crash program. Hundreds of thousands of residents, state workers, and students have carried out several patriotic health campaigns. The city has launched a search for and sealing of rat holes. According to statistics from sixteen townships and forty-nine primary schools in Jin County, young people and children have eliminated more than 24,300 sparrows and more than 23,400 rats in the past ten days, sealed more than 193,000 rat holes, and sealed more than 117,000 sparrow nests. While removing garbage and sewage, they also collected more than 110,000 kilograms of ashes and plant ash from residents' yards, which can be used as fertilizer.

The "Eliminate the Four Pests, Promote Hygiene" crash program in Lüda City started on the 15th. The movement is divided into five stages, with the current focus on eliminating rats. The Spring Festival is the second stage, focusing on cleaning the environment and eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies. After the Spring Festival, it will be divided into stages to eliminate sparrows, dig up pupae, and remove garbage, as well as mopping-up work. At present, the propaganda and organization work for eliminating the four pests is being carried out extensively.

    江西除四害运动声势浩大
    旅大市开展讲卫生突击运动
    新华社南昌22日电　江西省的除四害运动目前已成为声势浩大的群众运动。这个运动从1月12日南昌市出动二十六万人除四害开始，以后九江市、景德镇市、赣州市都在党政负责干部的带动下，组织了四万到五万人的除四害进军，农村也跟着行动起来。据上饶专区九个县市的统计，目前已捕鼠二十一万只，灭雀十六万只，挖蛹七百斤，从清洁卫生中积肥三千四百担。特别是余江县，在除四害中，每一机关干部已平均积肥二百零二担，城市居民和农民每人近三百担。
    现在除四害运动中的问题是：个别地区停留在一般布置，不见具体行动；有些地区运动一般地搞起来了，但领导决心不大，劲头不足。中共江西省委和江西省人民委员会特为此对各地作了指示，要求没有具体行动的地区要赶快行动起来，并要采取措施迎头赶上先进地区，领导决心不大的地区，要马上下决心，鼓足劲头，站在运动的前列来领导运动。中共江西省委和江西省人民委员会还要求机关、工厂、学校、企业、街道，应以共青团为核心组织除四害突击队；要求各级党政机关加强对运动的领导，建立与健全各级爱国运动委员会，迅速开展工作，并建立检查、汇报制度。
    现在中共江西省委会和江西省人民委员会已做出规划，要求全省在七年内基本消灭四害。这个规划是：城市三年或四年，即二年或三年战斗，一年扫尾；农村五年或七年，即四年或五年战斗，一年或二年扫尾。
    新华社旅大22日电　旅大市人民正在展开“除四害、讲卫生”突击运动，几十万居民、国家工作人员和学生先后进行了几次爱国卫生大清扫，全市展开了搜寻和堵塞鼠洞的工作。据金县十六个乡和四十九所小学的统计，青年和少年在近十天里已经消灭麻雀二万四千三百多只，消灭老鼠二万三千四百多只，堵塞了十九万三千多个老鼠洞，堵塞了十一万七千多个麻雀窝。他们在清除垃圾和污水的同时，还从居民院里收集了二百二十多万斤可作肥料的草木灰。
    旅大市除四害、讲卫生突击运动是从15日开始的，运动分五个阶段进行，目前着重灭鼠。春节是第二阶段，着重清扫环境，消灭越冬蚊蝇。春节以后再分段进行消灭麻雀、挖蛹和清除垃圾以及扫尾工作。目前，除四害的宣传组织工作正在广泛进行。
