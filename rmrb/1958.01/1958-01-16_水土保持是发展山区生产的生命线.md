Soil and Water Conservation is the Lifeline for Developing Mountainous Areas

Four months ago (September 8, 1957), this newspaper discussed the issue of soil and water conservation in an editorial entitled "A Major Task in Transforming Nature." Now, as the call to "develop mountainous areas and build mountainous areas" is being transformed into the conscious action of millions, here are a few more suggestions.

Soil and water conservation work is a major measure for transforming nature, and it is closely linked to all aspects, as everyone knows. What I want to emphasize here is the relationship between soil and water conservation and the development of production in mountainous areas. Vice Premier Deng Zihui recently said at the Second National Soil and Water Conservation Work Conference that soil and water conservation is the "lifeline for developing production in mountainous areas." This sentence most appropriately expresses the close relationship between soil and water conservation work and mountainous production. If the people in mountainous areas want to continuously and rapidly develop production and get rid of poverty, they must make their best efforts to do a good job in soil and water conservation.

As a result of people's indiscriminate felling of forests and reclamation of sloping land for thousands of years, the ground has lost the protection of trees and grass, the soil is constantly eroded, the fertility of cultivated land is declining, and agricultural output is getting lower and lower. In areas with severe soil erosion in the north, such as the northern parts of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces and parts of Gansu province, the grain yield per mu of cultivated land is only a few dozen jin, and many cultivated lands are washed into gullies and wasteland by mountain floods every year. In these areas, if soil erosion is not stopped, agricultural production will not only fail to move forward, but will even shrink!

To develop production and build mountainous areas, we must have the determination to transform nature and conquer nature, and work together to fight tenaciously against the phenomenon of soil erosion. After years of practice, our country has now found the correct principles and methods for soil and water conservation. "Combining prevention and treatment, emphasizing both treatment and maintenance" - this is the national policy for soil and water conservation work. "Based on relying on the masses to develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production, implement comprehensive planning, and concentrate on treatment in accordance with local conditions. Continuous treatment, comprehensive treatment, combining gully and slope treatment, and focusing on slope treatment." - This is the policy for curbing soil erosion in areas with soil erosion. As long as these two principles are conscientiously implemented and various soil and water conservation methods are adopted in accordance with local conditions, such as afforestation, planting grass, building terraced fields, building field ridges, building check dams, digging reservoirs and water storage pits, etc., the rainwater on the mountains can be effectively controlled and a large amount of soil erosion can be prevented. This can cultivate land fertility, protect cultivated land on hillsides and at the foot of mountains, and further develop irrigation in mountainous areas, which will greatly increase agricultural production. If soil and water resources are well protected, various resources in mountainous areas can also be fully utilized to develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production, making the mountainous economy flourish. In recent years, a large number of typical examples of production leaps have emerged in mountainous areas, including not only some agricultural cooperatives, but also some townships, districts, and counties. Why can their production leap forward? The most important and fundamental reason is that they have made great efforts to do a good job in soil and water conservation, transformed the natural environment, and developed diversified economies on this basis.

Some people say: "Soil and water conservation is good, but it is like a distant source of water that cannot quench immediate thirst." Is the effect of soil and water conservation work really so far away and indefinite? The abundant successful experiences in various places have most powerfully refuted this statement. In fact, soil and water conservation work can quench both distant and immediate thirst. As long as we pay attention to combining long-term interests with current interests in specific work, and combine soil and water conservation projects with the current production of the masses, we can get benefits in the year of construction. The Hongyue Agricultural Cooperative in Pingliang County, Gansu Province, planted trees in horizontal ditches and check dams, while planting various melons in the ditches, and also used scattered weir nests to plant buckwheat and other crops. In the first year of treatment, the cooperative used only 500 yuan from the income of one ditch to buy a mule and a cow. In addition, it protected 500 mu of river land at the mouth of the ditch from flooding; due to the effect of soil and water conservation projects, the average yield per mu of millet on the tableland increased from 180 jin before treatment to 290 jin in the same year. Facts have proved that as long as a village or a cooperative undergoes two or three years or three to five years of soil and water conservation work, the natural and economic landscape of the area can undergo tremendous changes: soil erosion stops, clear water flows in the rivers and ditches, and agricultural production increases significantly or even doubles. Jiyuan and Meng Counties in Henan Province spent only four years treating a Mang River and have already controlled 75% of the 1,226 square kilometers of soil erosion area. Wushan County, Gansu Province, is one of the areas with the most serious soil erosion. It began soil and water conservation work in 1952. Now, soil erosion has basically stopped in 40% of the county, and the county's average grain output per capita has doubled compared with before liberation. There are many facts about the rapid effectiveness of soil and water conservation work.

In the past few years, soil and water conservation work has achieved great results. Now, with the arrival of a new high tide of rural production, soil and water conservation work in our country is also entering a new stage of great development. The task before us is to greatly accelerate the progress of soil and water conservation work in the future, so that this work can keep up with the needs of rapidly developing production in mountainous areas, keep up with the needs of achieving the increased production targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program, and keep up with the needs of the country's entire socialist construction. Can this be done? To say definitively: it is entirely possible. The conditions for carrying out soil and water conservation work now are many times better than in the past few years. In the past, when many places began soil and water conservation work, they could only rely on a few elementary cooperatives and mutual aid groups to do it, and places without cooperatives and mutual aid groups could only rely on mobilizing individual farmers to do it; now, all places can rely on increasingly powerful agricultural cooperatives to carry out soil and water conservation work on a large scale. In the early years, local leading organs and farmers had little experience in soil and water conservation and had to explore on their own, so some places suffered many setbacks; now, after years of exploration and creation, rich and mature experience has been summarized, and correct soil and water conservation work policies have been formulated. The rise in the political awareness and enthusiasm for increased production of the vast number of farmers after socialist education is also a much better condition than in the past. If, under the conditions of the past, a community or a township or a county could make significant achievements in soil and water conservation in three or five years, then in the future, the same amount of time will certainly make much greater achievements than in the past. Therefore, every county, every township, and every agricultural cooperative in areas with soil erosion should formulate active and practical soil and water conservation plans, seize the opportunity, and vigorously carry out soil and water conservation work.

How can soil and water conservation work be quickly successful? The decisive key lies in truly relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses. The area of soil erosion is very vast, and it is impossible for the state to invest in soil and water conservation projects everywhere. Past experience has shown that if the masses are not fully mobilized, it is difficult to do a good job even if the state provides money. To mobilize the broad masses, we must first let the masses benefit from soil and water conservation work. The most important thing here is that soil and water conservation work must be combined with current production, and the completed soil and water conservation projects must be immediately comprehensively utilized, so that construction can be carried out in the same year and benefits can be obtained in the same year, and the benefits can be increased year by year. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses will become greater and greater. Some mountainous areas in Henan Province have done this, and the farmers are very happy. In order to combine soil and water conservation work with current production, it is also necessary to plan uniformly, arrange comprehensively, and correctly solve the problems of labor use for basic construction and production, the problem of labor remuneration, and the coordination of year-round construction and shock construction. In this regard, there has been better experience, and various places can adopt it according to local conditions.

The issue of how to prevent soil erosion is also a major issue. In mountainous areas in the south, soil erosion is generally relatively mild. However, in the past few years, some areas in the south have not paid enough attention to the issue of preventing soil erosion, and some mountainous areas have destroyed forests to reclaim wasteland and indiscriminately shoveled sod, resulting in new areas of soil erosion. This situation should never be allowed to continue in the future. All mountainous areas in the country should take effective measures to carry out unremitting struggles against phenomena that damage soil and water resources. In dealing with natural resources, we must resolutely abandon the exploitative "killing the chicken to get the egg" and "draining the pond to catch the fish" type of plundering practices adopted by the exploiting classes, and adopt an attitude of cultivating and protecting resources. Only in this way can we use natural resources to benefit the people continuously.

### 水土保持是发展山区生产的生命线

    水土保持是发展山区生产的生命线
    四个月以前（1957年9月8日），本报曾在题为“改造自然的一项重大任务”的社论中，讨论过水土保持问题。现在，当“开发山区，建设山区”的号召正在变成千百万人的自觉行动的时候，这里再谈几点意见。
    水土保持工作是一项改造自然的重大措施，它同四面八方都有密切的联系，这是人所共知的。这里所要着重谈的，是水土保持同发展山区生产的关系。邓子恢副总理最近在全国第二次水土保持工作会议上说过：水土保持是“发展山区生产的生命线”。这句话最恰当地表达了水土保持工作跟山区生产的密切关系。山区人民要想不断地迅速发展生产，摆脱贫困的生活，就必须尽最大努力把水土保持工作做好。
    千百年来人们滥伐森林、滥垦坡地的结果，地面失去树草的庇护，土壤不断地受冲刷，耕地的肥力越来越减退，农业产量越来越低。在北方的土壤冲刷严重的地区，如山西、陕西两省的北部，甘肃省的部分地区，每亩耕地的粮食产量只有几十斤，每年还有许多耕地被山洪冲成了沟壑和荒滩。在这些地区，如果不制止土壤的冲刷，农业生产就不但不能前进一步，甚至还会萎缩下去！
    要想发展生产，建设山区，必须抱着改造自然、人定胜天的决心，齐心协力来跟土壤冲刷的现象作顽强的斗争。经过近些年的实践，现在我国在水土保持方面已经找到了正确的方针和办法。“预防与治理兼顾，治理与养护并重。”——这就是全国性的水土保持工作的方针。“在依靠群众发展农、林、牧、副业生产的基础上，实行全面规划，因地制宜地集中治理。连续治理，综合治理，沟坡兼治，治坡为主。”——这就是在水土流失地区制止土壤冲刷的方针。只要认真执行这两条方针，因地制宜地采取各种保持水土的方法，如造林、种草、修梯田、培地埂、修谷坊、挖蓄水池和蓄水坑，等等，就可以有效地把山上的雨水控制住，防止土壤大量流失。这样就可以培养地力，保护山坡和山脚的耕地，进而发展山区灌溉，结果就会大大增加农业生产。水土资源保护好了，也就可以充分地利用山区的多种资源，发展农业、林业、畜牧业、副业生产，使山区经济欣欣向荣。近几年来山区出现了一大批生产跃进的典型，不只有一些农业合作社，还有一些乡、区和县。它们的生产为什么能跃进？最重要、最根本的原因就在于它们下大力做好了水土保持工作，改造了自然环境，在这个基础上发展了多种经济。
    有人说：“水土保持好是好，就是远水不解近渴。”水土保持工作的效果难道真的是那样遥遥无期的吗？各地大量的成功的经验最有力地驳倒了这种说法。事实上，水土保持工作既能解远渴，也能解近渴。只要在具体工作中注意把长远利益和当前利益结合起来，使水土保持工程同群众当前生产结合起来，当年施工，当年就可得到收益。甘肃省平凉县洪岳农业合作社在水平沟和谷坊里栽树，同时在沟里种上各种瓜，还利用零星的堰窝地种荞麦等作物。这个社在治理的第一年，仅仅用一条沟里的收入的五百元，就买了一匹骡子和一头牛。此外，还保护了沟口五百亩川地不受水淹；塬面上的耕地由于水土保持工程起了作用，当年谷子的每亩平均产量由治理前的一百八十斤提高到二百九十斤。事实证明，一个村庄、一个合作社只要经过两三年或者三五年的水土保持工作，就可以使本地区的自然面貌和经济面貌发生巨大变化：土壤停止冲刷，河沟里清水长流，农业上显著地增产以至加倍地增产。河南省济源、孟县两县治理一条漭河，不过花了四年工夫，就已经做到在一千二百二十六平方公里的水土流失地区里控制了75％的面积。甘肃省武山县是土壤冲刷最严重的地区之一，从1952年开始进行水土保持工作，现在全县已有十分之四的地区基本上停止了土壤冲刷，全县按人口平均的粮食产量比解放前增加了一倍。水土保持工作迅速见效的事实多得很。
    过去几年，水土保持工作已经取得了很大的成绩。现在，随着农村生产新高潮的到来，我国水土保持工作也正在进入一个大发展的新阶段。摆在我们面前的任务就是在今后把水土保持工作的进度大大加快，使这项工作跟上迅速发展山区生产的需要，跟上实现全国农业发展纲要规定的增产指标的需要，跟上国家整个社会主义建设的需要。能不能做到这点呢？肯定地说：完全可能。现在进行水土保持工作的条件不知比过去几年好了多少倍。过去许多地方在开始进行水土保持工作的时候，只能依靠少数的初级合作社和互助组去做，没有合作社、互助组的地方只能靠动员个体农民去做；现在各地都可依靠力量日益壮大的农业合作社去大规模地开展水土保持工作。在最初几年，各地领导机关和农民群众对于水土保持很少有经验，只好摸索着去做，因此有些地方受到不少挫折；现在，经过几年的摸索和创造，已经总结出丰富的、成熟的经验，已经制定出正确的水土保持工作方针。广大农民经过社会主义教育以后政治觉悟和增产积极性的高涨，也是大大胜过过去的好条件。如果在过去那样的条件下，一个社或一个乡、一个县能够用三、五年的时间在水土保持方面做出显著的成绩，那么在今后用同样的时间就一定可以做出比过去大得多的成绩。因此，水土流失地区的每个县、每个乡、每个农业合作社都应当制定出积极的切实的水土保持规划，抓紧时机，大力开展水土保持工作。
    怎样才能使水土保持工作很快成功呢？决定性的关键在于真正依靠群众，发动群众。水土流失地区很广阔，到处都要国家投资兴办水土保持工程，事实上是不可能的。过去的经验证明：如果不把群众充分发动起来，即使国家拿出钱来，也很难办好。要发动广大群众，首先必须让群众从水土保持工作上得到好处。这里最要紧的是：必须把水土保持工作跟当前生产结合起来，把修好的水土保持工程立即综合利用起来，做到当年施工，当年受益，并且年年增加收益。这样，群众的劲头也就会越来越大。河南省一些山区这样做了，农民就非常高兴。为了把水土保持工作和当前生产结合起来，还需要统一筹划，全面安排，正确地解决基本建设和生产的用工问题、劳动报酬问题、常年施工和突击施工的配合等问题。在这方面，已经有了较好的经验，各地可以因地制宜地加以采用。
    如何预防水土流失的问题，也是一件大事。南方的山区，水土流失一般比较轻微。但是，过去几年，南方有些地区对于防止水土流失的问题重视不够，有些山区毁林开荒，滥铲草皮，以致造成新的水土流失地区。这种情况以后绝不应当让它继续存在。全国所有的山区都应当采取有效的措施同破坏水土资源的现象进行不懈的斗争。在对待自然资源的问题上，我们必须坚决唾弃剥削阶级所采取的那种“杀鸡取蛋”“竭泽而渔”式的掠夺的做法，而对资源采取培养和保护的态度。只有这样，才能永不间断地利用自然资源为人民谋福利。
