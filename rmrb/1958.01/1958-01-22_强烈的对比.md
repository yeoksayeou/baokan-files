    A Stark Contrast

    The Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers issued a letter to agricultural workers, summarizing the great achievements made by the Soviet Union on the agricultural front last year, filled with optimism and confidence in the future. However, just a few days earlier, U.S. President Eisenhower's message to Congress on agricultural policy was filled with anxiety about the increasingly severe agricultural crisis.

    The Soviet Union's communique put forward the task of further increasing agricultural products, calling for expanding the planting area of crops and increasing the yield per unit area; the American message, however, indicated that the U.S. government will force small and medium-sized farmers to reduce arable land in order to achieve agricultural production cuts.

    The Soviet Union's communique announced the rapid development of Soviet dairy animal husbandry, making it possible for the Soviet Union to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita milk production this year; while the slogan put forward by the U.S. government is "More guns, less butter."

    From this communique of the Soviet Union and the recent messages of the United States, it is not difficult to appreciate the difference between the two systems of socialism and capitalism.

    强烈的对比
    苏共中央和部长会议发表告农业工作者书，总结了苏联去年在农业战线上取得的巨大成就，充满着乐观主义的情绪和对前景的信心。但就在几天以前，美总统艾森豪威尔向国会提出的关于农业政策的咨文，却是满纸对日益加剧的农业危机威胁的忧虑。
    苏联的文告提出进一步增加农产品的任务，号召扩大农作物播种面积和提高单位面积产量；美国的咨文却表示美国政府将强迫中小农民缩小耕地面积，以求实现农业减产。
    苏联的文告宣告了苏联产奶畜牧业的高速度发展，使得苏联今年就可能在按人口平均计算的牛奶产量方面赶上美国；而美国政府提出的口号却是“多些大炮，少些黄油”。
    从苏联的这个文告和美国最近的几个咨文中，不难体会出社会主义和资本主义两个制度的区别。
