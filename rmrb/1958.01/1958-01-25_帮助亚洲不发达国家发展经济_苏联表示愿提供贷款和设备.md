Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, January 22nd: The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East's Committee on Industry and Trade is continuing its meeting in Bangkok. At the meeting on the 22nd, discussions continued on the report made by the Commission's Secretary on the current trade situation of various countries in the region.

    In his speech at the meeting, the head of the Soviet delegation, Migunov, pointed out that despite some expansion in foreign trade ties, countries in the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East region are still experiencing various serious difficulties in foreign trade. The decline in commercial activities in some major capitalist countries is the main reason for this situation. The flooding of the markets of some countries in this region with American goods and the reduction in American imports also have adverse effects.

    When talking about the trade relations between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries with the countries in this region, the Soviet representative pointed out that this relationship is based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, which are sufficient to promote the strengthening of peace and friendship between the peoples of all countries. For example, according to preliminary statistics, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and India has almost doubled compared to 1956, and increased more than seven times compared to 1955; the trade volume with Indonesia has increased to one and a half times that of 1956, and increased five times compared to 1955.

    The Soviet representative finally pointed out that in order to further expand trade relations with countries in the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East region and promote the economic development of these countries, the Soviet Union's foreign trade organizations are prepared to provide various equipment to organizations and companies in economically underdeveloped countries on a five-year installment payment basis.

    帮助亚洲不发达国家发展经济
    苏联表示愿提供贷款和设备
    据新华社23日讯　塔斯社曼谷22日讯：联合国亚洲和远东经济委员会工业和贸易委员会在曼谷继续开会。在22日的会议上继续讨论了经济委员会秘书所作的关于这个地区各国当前贸易情况的报告。
    苏联代表团团长米古诺夫在会议上发言指出，尽管对外贸易联系有了某些扩大，亚洲和远东经济委员会地区各国在对外贸易方面仍然经受着种种严重困难。一些主要资本主义国家商业活动的衰退是造成这种情况的主要原因。美国商品充斥这一地区的某些国家的市场以及美国进口的缩减也有着不良的影响。
    谈到苏联和其他社会主义国家同这一地区各国的贸易关系的时候，苏联代表指出，这种关系是建立在足以促进加强和平和各国人民之间的友谊的平等互利的原则上的。例如，根据初步统计，苏联同印度的贸易额比1956年几乎增加了一倍，比1955年增加了七倍多；同印度尼西亚的贸易额增加为1956年的一点五倍，比1955年增加了五倍。
    苏联代表最后指出，为了进一步扩大同亚洲和远东经济委员会所属地区各国的贸易关系和促进这些国家的经济发展，苏联的对外贸易组织准备通过为期五年的分期付款方式为经济上不发达国家的组织和公司提供各种设备。
