	Writing a Letter Home
	Xing Zi
	Saturday afternoon is the time the company sets aside for tidying up personal belongings. In the squad, some were doing laundry, others were doing homework.

	Soldier Li Zhenying was an impatient person, and he always did everything in a hurry. After coming off duty, he rushed to the kitchen for food, and rushed back to the squad. In between, the clerk handed him a letter, so he opened it on the way, reading as he walked. By the time he got back to the squad, he had finished reading the letter, and as he put down his rifle and greatcoat, he shouted:
	"Liu Jiaxing, write a letter for me!"
	"To whom?"
	"My wife!"

	Most comrades who ask others to write home letters are usually quiet and reserved. Li Zhenying was different, as if he was afraid people wouldn't know, shouting at the top of his voice. Everyone had long figured out his temper, so, as usual, an interesting "show" began again. First, the comrade who was to write the letter deliberately took his time, closed his book, and blinked his eyes, saying:
	"I want to drink some water..."

	Li Zhenying glared at him and quickly poured a mug of water.
	"Isn't there still some white sugar in your satchel?"
	"You!" Li Zhenying finally couldn't help it, threatening and roaring with his fist. "I'm getting angry! I'm going to beat you up!"

	The whole squad burst into laughter. Li Zhenying also laughed along with them, and at the same time took the white sugar out of the satchel on the personal belongings board, and put the paper and pen on the table.
	"That's more like it!" Liu Jiaxing took a big gulp of water and dipped the pen full of ink. "Am I writing, or are you dictating for me to write?"
	"I'll dictate and you write!" he said, focusing all his attention on the wording of the letter. "You write... Dear Comrade Xiulan!..."

	Here, everyone made interjections:
	"So mushy! 'Dear' indeed!"
	"Hey! Just that name is enough to be spoiled - 'Xiulan'!"

	Probably Li Zhenying was used to everyone's jokes like this, he continued reading without caring:
	"...I received your letter, please don't worry..."
	"So polite! Did you hear that? - 'Please'!"
	"I am in good health now, and I haven't gotten sick."
	"So you don't have to cry!"
	"...haven't gotten sick. I miss you very much too."
	"Write: I miss you so much I'm dying!"
	"...I miss you... Don't write 'I miss you so much I'm dying'! - Don't mess around, okay? Isn't this just heckling, comrades! I'm really getting angry!..."

	So everyone laughed again.
	"...Our work is very intense, and my studies are not bad..."
	"Wrong! You're lying! You only got a three in military class last week!"
	"I didn't mean to lie!... Okay, you write: Recently, my studies have not been very good, and I'm always impatient... You said in your letter that you want to leave that production team, why is that? Why can't you get along with Fifth Uncle? You should strengthen your organization and discipline! It doesn't matter if the private plot isn't doing well, there's no need to be upset, as long as..."
	"As long as you do a good job in the commune..."
	"Yes, as long as you do a good job in the commune..."

	At this point, as soon as they heard about the agricultural commune, no one joked anymore. Everyone gave advice in a lively discussion, how to work, how to contribute strength to socialism, talking about raising pigs, and then talking about improving breeds, and increasing yield per unit area, and so on. Those washing clothes stopped washing clothes, those reading books stopped reading books, almost the entire squad gathered around the table. One person said one thing, another person said another thing, all adding to the letter. In the end, the comrade writing the letter had no choice but to put the pen on the table and say:
	"Who am I listening to? - Is this his home letter, or is it your letter to the people of the motherland?"

	Li Zhenying thought for a moment, then suddenly laughed and replied:
	"Both! Both!"

	He solemnly took out his seal (he always stamps his letters), breathed on it, and stamped it below his name. At this time, the duty platoon leader blew the whistle to have each squad send someone to help the kitchen unload rice. Li Zhenying hurriedly stuffed the letter into his pocket, said "I'll go!" to the squad leader, and ran out.

	The squad returned to silence.

    写家信
    兴子
    星期六下午，是连里规定整理内务时间。在班里，有的洗衣服，有的写作业。
    战士李振英是个性急人，他无论做什么都是一副匆忙样子。下了哨，他匆匆忙忙赶到伙房吃饭，匆匆忙忙回班，之间，文书交给他一封信，于是，在路上他就拆开，一面走一面看。回到班里，信也看完了，就一面搁枪、放大衣，一面叫道：
    “刘家騂，替我写封信！”
    “给谁的？”
    “老婆！”
    有的同志找人代写家书，多半是小声小气的。李振英则不同，好像怕人不知道似的，直着嗓子叫。大家早就摸透了他的脾气，因此，跟往常一样，一场有趣的“戏”又开场了。先是，代书的那位同志故意不紧不慢，阖上书，眨眨眼皮，说：
    “我想喝点水。……”
    李振英瞪了他一眼，很快的倒了一缸子水。
    “你那挎包不是还有点白糖？”
    “你呀！”李振英果然忍不住了，拿拳头威胁、咆哮。“我发火啦！我要揍你啦！”
    全班爆发了大笑。李振英也跟着笑，同时从内务板上的挎包里把白糖掏出来，又把纸和笔放到桌子上。
    “这还差不多！”刘家騂大口的喝水，把笔饱蘸了墨水。“是我写？还是你念我写？”
    “我念你写！”他说，全神贯注在信词上。“你写……亲爱的秀兰同志！……”
    这里，大家作插曲了：
    “酸劲！还‘亲爱的’哪！”
    “嘿！光这名字就够娇的啦——‘秀兰’！”
    大概李振英也习惯了大家这样的玩笑，他毫不在意的继续念下去：
    “……你的来信我收到了，请不要挂念。……”
    “多客气！听见了没有？——‘请’！”
    “我现在身体很好，没有得病。”
    “省得你哭鼻子！”
    “……没有得病。我也很想念你。”
    “写上：想都想死啦！”
    “……想都……别写‘想都想死啦’！——别捣乱好不好？这不叫起哄吗？同志们！我可真发火啦！……”
    于是大家又一阵大笑。
    “……我们的工作很紧张，我的学习也不坏。……”
    “错了！你说谎！上星期你的军事课才三分！”
    “我不是故意说谎的！……好，你写：最近，我的学习不大好，总是急躁。……你信上说，你要跳出那个生产队，这是为什么呢？为什么和五叔搞不好团结呢？你应该加强组织性纪律性才是！自留地种的不好，这没有什么，用不着苦恼，只要……”
    “只要做好社里的工作……”
    “对，只要做好社里的工作……”
    到这里，一听到农业社，谁也不再开玩笑了。大家七嘴八舌的给出主意，应该怎样工作，怎样为社会主义拿出力量来，说了养猪，又说了改良品种，以及提高单位面积产量等等。洗衣服的不再洗衣服，看书的不再看书，全班差不多都凑在桌子四周。你一句，我一句，尽往信上添。最后弄得代书的同志没有办法，只好把笔往桌子上一放，说：
    “我听谁的呀？——是他的家信，还是你们给祖国人民的信哪？”
    李振英想了想，突然大笑起来，应道：
    “都是！都是！”
    他郑重地把图章掏出来（他从来写信都盖图章），呵口气，盖在名字下面。这时，值星排长吹哨让各班出一个差帮助伙房卸米。李振英匆匆忙忙的把信塞进兜里，和班长说声“我去！”就跑了出去。
    班里又恢复了安静。
