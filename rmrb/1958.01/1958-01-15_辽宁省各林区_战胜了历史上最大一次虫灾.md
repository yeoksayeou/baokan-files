Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 14th: Liaoning Province's forest areas conquered the historically largest insect plague in 1957, basically controlling the expansion and spread of forest pests. Starting in April 1957, the masses in Liaoning Province's forest areas and many organizations and groups launched a fierce struggle against forest pests. After more than six months of continuous battle, they finally extinguished the most rampant forest insect plague. According to preliminary statistics, a total of 44,163 workers were used, eliminating forest pests on 5,016 hectares, more than double the area treated in 1956. More than 74,800 catties of various pests were captured and destroyed, protecting the safety of the forests.

In order to protect forest resources, with the importance attached by local Party and government leaders, emergency measures were taken in accordance with the principle of "early treatment, comprehensive treatment, and thorough treatment." All localities promptly conducted in-depth investigations of insect conditions in forest farms and launched a campaign to eliminate forest pests.
