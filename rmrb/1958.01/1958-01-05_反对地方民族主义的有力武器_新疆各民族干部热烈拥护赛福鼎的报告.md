Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, January 4th: Cadres of all nationalities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region warmly support the report "Resolutely Oppose Local Nationalism and Strive for the Great Victory of Socialism!" made by Saifudin, Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the Enlarged Meeting of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

More than 200 Party committee members, alternate members, and responsible Party cadres from various regions and departments who participated in the Enlarged Meeting of the Autonomous Region Party Committee have conducted multiple discussions on this report. In their speeches at more than ten days of meetings, both large and small, they unanimously agreed that this report is of great significance for consolidating the Party's leadership, safeguarding the unity of the motherland, enhancing unity among all nationalities, and promoting the victorious development of the Autonomous Region's socialist construction. In their speeches, many people, in addition to examining their own thoughts based on the spirit of the report, also exposed and criticized the remarks of some local nationalists.

Mamatov (Uyghur), Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, said that the ideological tendency of Xinjiang local nationalism has now developed to the point of being anti-Party and anti-socialist. Saifudin's report pointed out the direction of the struggle for us. In the past, the main opposition was to Han chauvinism, which was necessary. Now, we need to resolutely oppose local nationalism.

Major General Margov (Tatar), Commander of the Ili Military Region, said: Local nationalists oppose the leadership of the Party and oppose the Han people. Their purpose is to achieve independence and establish a republic. Saifudin's report is a powerful weapon for us to fight against local nationalists.

Gershia (Mongolian), Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Bortala Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, said: Local nationalists attack the Party under the guise of "safeguarding national interests" in an attempt to undermine the unity of the motherland and national unity. This is absolutely not allowed. Bazarbek (Kazak), Deputy Governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, pointed out indignantly: The people of Bortala unanimously request and wholeheartedly welcome the help of the Han people, but local nationalists desperately oppose it, just as the Mongolian proverb says: "Bad people don't like good things, thieves don't like the moon." We must act according to the people's opinions and tear off the mask of local nationalists who claim to "speak for the people."

The Uyghur poet Teyipjiang said: Local nationalists in literary and art circles openly want to transform the literary and artistic direction serving socialism into a literary and artistic direction serving nationalism. We must wage a resolute struggle against them.

Major General Zuluntaiyef (Uyghur), Deputy Chief of Staff of the Xinjiang Military Region, said: Some people ridiculously attribute the root of local nationalism to Han chauvinism. In fact, the Party in Xinjiang has consistently carried out the struggle against Han chauvinism. Now Han chauvinism is gradually decreasing, but local nationalism has grown. We must prevent sentimentalism and liberalism, and wage a resolute struggle against local nationalists who are anti-Party and anti-socialist.

Minority cadres from various organs and organizations in Urumqi City, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Yining City, Kashgar Prefecture, and Kashgar City also enthusiastically studied Saifudin's report and held discussions. They generally believed that Saifudin's report pointed out the direction and increased the combat strength for minority cadres who are carrying out the rectification movement. More than 130 CPPCC members and attendees from twelve nationalities who are participating in the Ili Autonomous Prefecture CPPCC meeting unanimously passed a resolution supporting Saifudin's report. Yusupkhan (Kazak), Deputy Governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, said: There is a Kazakh proverb "A herd animal that leaves the group will be eaten by wolves." Local nationalists who create independence and attempt to split the unity of the motherland are just daydreaming about splitting Xinjiang and then letting the brutal wolf of imperialism eat it. This is something we can never tolerate. Asim Imin (Uyghur), Chairman of the grassroots trade union of the Kashgar Daily Printing Factory, said: When I studied and visited the interior, I saw many factories manufacturing machines and equipment for Xinjiang. In Lanzhou, 200 young people from Xinjiang are learning to drive trains, and minority workers are also learning at the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant. Local nationalists oppose the help of the Han people. Our working class must wage a resolute struggle against them. Abudulim (Uyghur), Deputy Director of the Chinese Department of Xinjiang College, said: Local nationalists who use the banner of "loving the nation" are actually people who betray the interests of their own nation.

    反对地方民族主义的有力武器
    新疆各民族干部热烈拥护赛福鼎的报告
    新华社乌鲁木齐4日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各民族干部热烈拥护中共新疆维吾尔自治区党委书记赛福鼎在中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会扩大会上所作的“坚决反对地方民族主义，为社会主义的伟大胜利而奋斗！”的报告。
    参加自治区党委扩大会议的党委委员、候补委员以及各地区、各部门的党员负责干部二百多人，已经对这个报告作了多次讨论，在十多天的大小会议上的发言中，一致认为这个报告对于巩固党的领导，维护祖国统一，增强各民族之间的团结，推进自治区社会主义建设事业的胜利发展，都具有重大意义。在发言中，许多人除根据报告精神检查了自己的思想外，还对一些地方民族主义者的言论进行了揭露和批判。
    自治区党委组织部副部长马木托夫（维吾尔）说，新疆地方民族主义的思想倾向，现在已经发展到反党、反社会主义的地步，赛福鼎的报告给我们指出了斗争的方向。过去主要反对了大汉族主义，那是必要的，现在就需要坚决地反对地方民族主义。
    伊犁军区司令员马尔果夫少将（塔塔尔）说：地方民族主义者反对党的领导，反对汉族人民，其目的是要搞独立，搞共和国，赛福鼎的报告是我们同地方民族主义者进行斗争的有力武器。
    中共博尔塔拉蒙古族自治州州委副书记格尔夏（蒙古）说：地方民族主义者打着“维护民族利益”的幌子向党进攻，企图破坏祖国统一和民族团结，这是绝对不能容许的。这个自治州的副州长巴扎尔别克（哈萨克）激愤地指出：博尔塔拉人民一致要求和衷心欢迎汉族人民的帮助，但地方民族主义者却拼命反对，正如蒙古族谚语所说：“坏人不喜欢好事，小偷不喜欢月亮”。我们要根据人民的意见办事，撕破地方民族主义者“代表人民说话”的假面具。
    维吾尔族诗人铁衣甫江说：文艺界的地方民族主义者，明目张胆地要把为社会主义服务的文艺方向转变成为民族主义服务的文艺方向，我们必须和他们进行坚决的斗争。
    新疆军区副参谋长祖龙太也夫（维吾尔）少将说：有人可笑地把地方民族主义的根源归之于大民族主义，事实上党在新疆一贯地进行了反对大汉族主义的斗争，现在大汉族主义是日渐减少，地方民族主义却有了滋长。我们一定要防止温情主义和自由主义，和反党反社会主义的地方民族主义者进行坚决的斗争。
    乌鲁木齐市、伊犁哈萨克族自治州、伊宁市、喀什专区、喀什市各机关团体的少数民族干部，也都热烈学习赛福鼎的报告，纷纷举行座谈，普遍认为赛福鼎的报告给正在开展整风运动的少数民族干部指出了方向，增加了战斗力量。正在参加伊犁自治州政协会议的十二个民族的一百三十多个政协委员和列席人员，一致通过了拥护赛福鼎的报告的决议。自治州副州长玉素甫汉（哈萨克）说：哈萨克族有一句谚语“离群的牲畜一定被狼吃”，闹独立、企图分裂祖国统一的地方民族主义者，只是妄想把新疆分裂出去，然后让帝国主义那只凶暴的野狼吃掉。这是我们决不能容忍的。喀什日报印刷厂基层工会主席阿西木依明（维吾尔）说：我在内地学习参观时，看见许多工厂正在给新疆制造机器和设备，在兰州有二百个新疆青年正在学习开火车，在北京石景山发电厂也有少数民族工人在学习，地方民族主义者却反对汉族的帮助，我们工人阶级一定要和它作坚决的斗争。新疆学院语文系副主任阿不都里木（维吾尔）说：打着“热爱民族”幌子的地方民族主义者，实际上是出卖本民族利益的人。
