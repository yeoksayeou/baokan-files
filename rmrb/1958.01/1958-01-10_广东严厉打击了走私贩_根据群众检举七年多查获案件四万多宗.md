Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 8th. Over 700,000 people in Guangzhou and nearby areas visited the anti-smuggling exhibition held in Guangzhou, receiving education on the anti-smuggling struggle.

Since the exhibition opened in November last year, according to statistics from relevant departments, Guangzhou residents alone reported over 1,400 cases of smuggling activities. More than 300 people involved in smuggling and illicit trade confessed their crimes to the People's Government and received lenient treatment.

The exhibition, jointly organized by the Guangzhou, Kowloon, and Gongbei Customs, closed on the 5th.

The exhibits, charts, and other materials demonstrated that smuggling activities seriously harm our country. For nearly a century before liberation, it was a means for imperialism to carry out economic aggression against our country. In 1948 alone, in Guangzhou, 80% of businesses in industries such as textiles, rubber, cigarettes, matches, hardware, and batteries were forced to close down, mainly due to the smuggling and dumping of foreign goods. After liberation, smuggling activities caused great losses to the state. According to statistics from the Guangzhou, Kowloon, and Gongbei Customs from 1950 to 1956, smuggling and currency speculation caused the state to lose foreign exchange worth HK$1.6 billion (equivalent to over RMB 680 million).

More seriously, smuggling activities were used by the Kuomintang reactionaries and imperialism as a means to carry out political sabotage against us. The exhibition displayed a publication called "Notice for Returning Home and to Hong Kong" issued by the Kuomintang secret service in Hong Kong and Macau, which entirely incited smuggling and taught smuggling methods. From the exhibits and revealed cases, it can also be seen that smuggling activities are inextricably linked to the Kuomintang reactionaries. On display were explosives, guns, secret writing powder, opium, reactionary books and periodicals, and radio stations smuggled in, as well as certain internal publications and telephone directories of organs that were attempted to be smuggled out.

The exhibition revealed that the majority of those engaged in smuggling activities were counter-revolutionaries, landlords, local bullies, and illegal elements of the bourgeoisie. A chart showed that among the 4,162 members of the 243 smuggling groups cracked down on after liberation, counter-revolutionaries, landlords, local bullies, illegal elements of the bourgeoisie, and hooligans accounted for more than 66%. The exhibition displayed hundreds of pieces of smuggled goods and tools specially used to hide them, including cans, thermos bottles, batteries, and leather shoes hiding watches and high-speed steel, earrings hiding diamonds, vests specially made of raw rubber, fuses disguised as sewing machine belts, explosives disguised as soft candies, cigarettes rolled with secret writing powder, and counterfeit medicinal materials, medicines, and other fake goods. Smugglers even used methods such as hiding in their bodies and swallowing to smuggle. The exhibition also revealed that some returned overseas Chinese and people returning home from Hong Kong and Macau also engaged in illegal smuggling because they were greedy for high profits.

The exhibition used rich materials to illustrate that the anti-smuggling struggle has a broad mass base. From 1950 to the end of September 1957, the people of Guangdong Province sent more than 123,500 letters to the government reporting smuggling, and a total of 41,100 cases were discovered based on public tips. Many workers, peasants, fishermen, cadres, residents, and housewives have been rewarded by the government for fighting against smuggling and illicit trade.

    广东严厉打击了走私贩
    根据群众检举七年多查获案件四万多宗
    新华社广州8日电　广州市和附近地区有七十多万人参观了在广州市举办的反走私展览会后，受到了反走私斗争的教育。
    在去年11月这个展览会开始展出以来，据有关部门统计，仅广州市居民检举的走私活动即达一千四百多件，还有三百多个有走私贩私行为的人向人民政府坦白了自己的犯罪行为，受到宽大处理。
    这个展览会是广州、九龙、拱北三个海关联合举办的，已在5日闭幕。
    展览会展出的实物、图表等表明，走私行为对我们国家的危害是严重的。在解放以前近百年间，它一直是帝国主义对我国实行经济侵略的一种手段，1948年仅广州一地，纱布、橡胶、纸烟、火柴、电池、五金等行业户，主要因洋货走私和倾销被迫倒闭的就占80％。解放以后，走私活动使国家受到很大损失。据广州、九龙、拱北三个海关1950年到1956年查获的案件统计，走私套汇使国家损失外汇价值港币十六亿元（合人民币六亿八千多万元）。
    更严重的是，走私活动被国民党反动派和帝国主义利用作为向我们进行政治破坏的手段。展览会展出了一本国民党特务机关在港澳发行的名叫“还乡返港须知”的刊物，它的内容全是煽动走私、教唆走私方法的。另从展出的实物和揭露的案件中，也可以看到走私活动同国民党反动派有着千丝万缕的关系。这里陈列有走私分子运进的炸药、枪支、密写粉、鸦片、反动书刊、电台，以及企图运出的某些机关内部刊物、电话号码簿等等。
    展览会揭露，从事走私活动的人，以反革命分子、地主恶霸、资产阶级不法分子等为最多。一张图表记载：解放后破获的二百四十三个走私集团的四千一百六十二个成员中，反革命分子、地主恶霸、资产阶级不法分子和流氓地痞等占66％以上。展览会展出了几百件走私分子偷运的私货和专门藏匿私货的工具，其中有藏手表和锋钢的罐头、热水瓶、电池、皮鞋，藏钻石的耳环，以生胶原料特制的背心，伪装成缝纫机皮带的导火线，伪装成软糖的炸药，卷藏密写粉的香烟等等，还有伪制的药材、药品和其他冒牌商品。走私分子甚至利用肉体暗藏、吞服等办法偷运。展览会还揭露，也有一些归国华侨和港澳回乡的人因为贪图厚利而违法走私。
    展览会以丰富的材料说明，展开反走私斗争已具有广泛的群众基础。从1950年到1957年9月底，广东省各地人民群众向政府检举走私的信件达十二万三千五百多件，经人民群众检举而查获的案件共四万一千一百多宗。许多工人、农民、渔民、干部、居民、家庭妇女都因为向走私贩私行为作斗争而获得政府的奖励。
