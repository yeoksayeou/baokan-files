What are the characteristics of citrus fruits
    Jiang Younong
It is now the season when citrus fruits are on the market in large quantities. Our country has the largest output of citrus fruits in the world, with large production and cheap prices.
    There are many kinds of citrus fruits produced in our country. The most common are oranges and tangerines; followed by oranges, such as Guanggan, Xuegan, and Yingan commonly found on the market are all oranges; and then pomelos (Wendan).
    Citrus fruits have many characteristics.
    First, they contain a particularly large amount of vitamin C. Apples and pears, for example, contain only a few milligrams of vitamin C per 100 grams (3.2 taels) of edible parts, while citrus fruits contain dozens of milligrams. The content in pomelos is the highest, about 40 to 150 milligrams, generally above 50 milligrams; followed by oranges, about 35 to 80 milligrams; and then oranges and tangerines, about 20 to 60 milligrams.
    Second, citrus fruits contain a considerable amount of carotene, vitamins B1, B2, and B6, as well as nicotinic acid, vitamin P and other nutrients, of which carotene and vitamin P are relatively high. Generally, fruits contain very little carotene (which can be converted into vitamin A in the human body). According to data from the Nutrition Department of the Central Institute of Hygiene in 1955, the carotene content of oranges, tangerines, oranges, and pomelos is one to six times higher than that of apples, with oranges and tangerines being four to five times higher than oranges and pomelos. The content of vitamin P (which can prevent stroke and other diseases caused by microvascular fragility) is also much higher than that of ordinary fruits. As for citrus fruits, oranges contain more vitamin P than oranges and tangerines, and pomelos contain more than oranges.
    Third, citrus fruits are particularly suitable for patients, postpartum women, children, and the elderly. Because the calcium and iron needed by the human body are several times higher in citrus fruits than in apples, etc., and they are particularly easy to absorb. The carbohydrates it contains are mainly fructose, which can be directly used by the human body without digestion. The acid it contains is mainly citric acid. Citric acid has the ability to help the human body digest. Therefore, eating citrus fruits can prevent vitamin C deficiency and stroke, and can help digestion.
    “The whole body is without waste” is the fourth characteristic of citrus fruits. Like the white filaments outside the citrus segments, it is the tangerine network, which is a rather expensive Chinese medicine, and is an effective medicine used by Chinese medicine to treat thirst, internal heat, vomiting alcohol, and indigestion. Their flesh segments are foods with high nutritional value. Their peel can be used for medicine, can be soaked in water for drinking, can be used as a condiment, or made into candy.
    There are many citrus fruits on the market, which one is the best to eat? According to the above, if the market prices are not much different, oranges are particularly worth eating more of. In addition, thin-skinned oranges, especially red thin-skinned oranges, have a higher vitamin C content; yellow-skinned oranges, especially early-maturing ones (those on the market early), have less vitamin C. Some people say, "The more sour the citrus fruit, the higher the vitamin C content," but there is no scientific basis for this. These can be used as a reference when you buy them.

    柑桔类水果有哪些特点
    江幼农
    现在正是柑桔类水果大量上市的季节。我们的祖国，是世界上出产柑桔类水果最多的国家，产量很大，价钱也便宜。
    我国所产的柑桔，种类极多。其中最常见的就是桔子和蜜柑；其次是橙子，像市场上常见的广柑、雪柑、印柑等等都是橙子；再次就是柚子（文旦）了。
    柑桔类水果有许多特点。
    第一、含有特别多的维生素丙。像苹果和梨等，每百克（合3.2市两）可吃部分只含有维生素丙几毫克，而柑桔类水果含有几十毫克。柚子的含量最高，约为四十至一百五十毫克，一般都在五十毫克以上；其次是橙子，约为三十五至八十毫克；再次是桔、柑，约为二十至六十毫克。
    第二、柑桔类含有相当数量的葫萝卜素、维生素乙1和乙2、乙6，以及尼克酸、维生素P等等营养素，其中葫萝卜素和维生素P含得较多。一般水果含的葫萝卜素（到人体中可变为维生素甲）都相当少。根据中央卫生研究院营养学系1955年的资料，桔、柑、橙、柚所含的葫萝卜素，要比苹果高出一至六倍，其中桔、柑要比橙、柚高出四至五倍。维生素P（可防治微血管脆裂所导致的中风等病）的含量，也远比一般水果高。至于在柑桔类中，橙子所含的维生素P要比桔、柑高，柚子又比橙子高。
    第三、柑桔类水果特别适宜于病人、产妇和小孩、老人吃。因为人体需要的钙和铁，柑桔类水果比苹果等要高几倍，而且特别容易被吸收。它所含的碳水化合物，主要是果糖，无需经过消化，就能被人体直接利用。它所含的酸，主要是柠檬酸。柠檬酸具有帮助人体消化的能力。因此吃柑桔类水果，可防治维生素丙缺乏症和中风，可以帮助消化。
    “一身无废物”是柑桔类水果的第四个特点。像柑桔瓣外的白丝，就是中药中价格相当贵的桔络，是中医用来医治口渴、上火、吐酒、消化不良等症的有效药物。它们的肉瓣是营养价值很高的食品。它们的皮可制药，可以泡水吃，可作调味品，或制成糖果。
    市上的柑桔类水果很多，究竟吃哪种最好呢？根据以上所说，如果市价相差不多的话，橙子是特别值得多吃的。另外，薄皮的桔子，特别是红色薄皮的桔子，维生素丙含量较高；黄皮的桔子，特别是早熟的（上市早的），维生素丙含得较少。有人说，“味越酸的柑桔类，维生素丙越高”，其实并没有科学根据。这些可供你选购时作参考。
