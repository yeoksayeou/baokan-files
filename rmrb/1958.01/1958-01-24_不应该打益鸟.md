    益鸟 Should Not Be Beaten
    Recently, I have noticed that some employees, under the pretext of eliminating the four pests, often go to the wild to hunt birds. However, they are not hitting harmful birds, but instead killing beneficial birds. For example, in mid-November last year, a section chief from the Hainan enterprise department went to the forest to hunt birds and killed two swallows without killing any harmful birds. I think it is very wrong to indiscriminately kill birds like this, without distinguishing between beneficial and harmful ones. Everyone knows that beneficial birds are of great benefit to humans, especially to farmers. Birds like cuckoos, Chinese bulbuls, woodpeckers, and swallows are all beneficial birds that eat pests, and they are powerful helpers in eliminating insect pests. A cuckoo can catch one hundred butterfly larvae in an hour; a nest of Chinese bulbuls can eliminate more than three hundred insect larvae a day; a woodpecker feeds its chicks pest insects about three hundred times a day; a nest of swallows can eliminate one million insects in a summer. I believe that everyone has a responsibility to protect beneficial birds, and the act of killing beneficial birds under the guise of eliminating the four pests should be prohibited.

    不应该打益鸟
    最近我发现有一些职工，借消灭四害为名，经常到野外去打鸟。但是他们并没有打着害鸟，反而把益鸟打死了。例如，去年11月中旬海南企业部门有个科长，到林中打鸟，就打死了两只燕子，没有打死害鸟。我认为这样不分益鸟害鸟，随便乱打是很不好的。大家都知道益鸟对人类，尤其对农民有很大益处，像杜鹃、白头翁、啄木鸟、燕子等都是吃害虫的益鸟，它们是消灭虫害的有力助手。杜鹃一小时就能捕捉一百只蝶类幼虫；一窝白头翁一天能消灭三百只以上的昆虫幼虫；啄木鸟一天要给雏鸟送害虫食物三百次左右；一窝燕子一个夏季能消灭一百万只昆虫。我认为人人都有责任保护益鸟，那种借名消灭四害，而打死益鸟的行为应该禁止。
