Provocation of Peace
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

The American troops and the Syngman Rhee troops in South Korea are currently holding an atomic "strike" exercise, the largest in scale since the armistice, near the military demarcation line. The American General Trudeau, who commands this exercise, clamored that the purpose of the exercise is to test the "nuclear strike force" of the American and Syngman Rhee troops. He bluntly admitted that his policy has always been to make the American troops stationed in South Korea "an offensive rather than a defensive force." He hopes that this exercise will teach the American troops how to "establish a killing field" for atomic weapons. This kind of mad clamor is undoubtedly a provocation to peace.

At present, the widespread and strong desire of the people of the world for peace, for negotiation, and for an end to the "cold war" is forming a huge trend that promotes the international situation towards relaxation. American imperialism is afraid of this trend. It fears that once the international situation relaxes, it will lose the excuse to expand its military preparations, control other capitalist countries, and suppress colonial national independence movements. Therefore, although the leaders of the American government have to talk about peace in words, they are actually increasing military spending, stepping up the production of missiles and nuclear weapons, and intensifying the "cold war." The atomic "strike" exercise conducted by the American troops in South Korea and the murderous clamor of the American general are obviously part of the American policy of intensifying nuclear weapons preparations. The purpose is to poison the international atmosphere in order to maintain the tense situation in the Korean region, and even the entire Asia and the entire world.

At the same time, the so-called atomic "strike" exercise conducted by the American and Syngman Rhee troops in South Korea is fundamentally incompatible with the spirit of the Korean Armistice Agreement and is another violation of the armistice agreement. The armistice agreement is intended to lead to peace in Korea and a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, while what the United States is doing in South Korea is trying to completely undermine the armistice agreement and threaten peace in Korea. The armistice agreement stipulates that neither side shall reinforce or transport new weapons, but the United States openly conducts so-called atomic "strike" exercises. Since the Korean armistice, the United States has continuously violated and undermined the armistice agreement, and has actively carried out war preparations in South Korea. The United States has not only expanded the Syngman Rhee army on a large scale, illegally transported a large amount of weapons and equipment to South Korea, but also continuously violated the military demarcation line, forcing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to stop its work in South Korea. In June last year, the United States, disregarding international credibility, unilaterally abolished Article 13(d) of the armistice agreement and openly transported new weapons into South Korea, reorganizing its troops stationed in South Korea into "five-unit atomic divisions." At the same time, the United States also attempted to transport its missiles into South Korea. All this shows that the purpose of the United States in doing so is to turn South Korea into its atomic war base and missile base to threaten peace in Asia.

The Korean and Chinese sides have made unremitting efforts to safeguard peace in Korea and the armistice agreement, and have waged unremitting struggles against this destructive behavior of the United States. The American troops and the Syngman Rhee troops' so-called atomic "strike" exercises and public calls for war cannot intimidate the Korean and Chinese people. This belligerent posture will not achieve any other result than to make itself increasingly isolated among the peace-loving people of the world. The American general should remember when issuing belligerent clamors: The Korean and Chinese people hope for peace, but are not afraid of war. Since the Korean and Chinese people had the power to repel the attack of the American aggressors in the past and finally achieved the armistice, they are even more powerful today to defend peace in Korea.

    对和平的挑衅
    本报评论员
    南朝鲜的美国军队和李承晚军队，目前正在军事分界线附近举行一场停战以来规模最大的原子“出击”演习。指挥这次演习的美国将军特鲁多叫嚣说，演习的目的就是要测验美国和李承晚军队的“核攻击力量”。他直言不讳地承认，他的政策一直是要使驻在南朝鲜的美国部队“成为进攻的而不是防御的部队”，他希望这次演习会使美国军队学会怎样为原子武器“建立一个屠杀场”。这种疯狂的叫嚣，无疑是对和平的一种挑衅。
    目前，全世界人民要求和平、要求协商、要求结束“冷战”的广泛而强烈的愿望，正形成为一股推动国际局势走向和缓的巨大潮流。美帝国主义是惧怕这股潮流的。它害怕国际局势一旦和缓下来，它就会失去扩军备战和控制其他资本主义国家、镇压殖民地民族独立运动的借口。因此，美国政府领导人虽然口头上也不得不谈谈和平，但实际上干的却是增加军费开支，加紧制造导弹和核武器，加剧“冷战”的勾当。在南朝鲜的美国军队进行原子“出击”演习以及美国将军的杀气腾腾的叫嚣，显然也是美国加紧进行核武器备战政策的一环。其目的就是要毒化国际气氛，以便保持朝鲜地区以至整个亚洲、整个世界的紧张局势。
    同时，美国和李承晚部队在南朝鲜进行的所谓原子“出击”演习，是同朝鲜停战协定的精神根本不相容的，是对停战协定的又一次破坏。停战协定是要导致朝鲜的和平，导致朝鲜问题的和平解决，而美国在南朝鲜所作所为，却是力图彻底破坏停战协定，威胁朝鲜的和平。停战协定规定，双方不得增援和运进新的武器，美国却公然举行所谓原子“出击”演习。自从朝鲜停战以来，美国就不断违反和破坏停战协定，在南朝鲜积极进行战争准备。美国不仅大规模扩充李承晚军队，向南朝鲜非法运进大量武器装备，并且不断侵犯军事分界线，迫使中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜停止了工作。去年6月，美国更不顾国际信义，片面废除了停战协定十三款卯项，公然把新武器运进南朝鲜，把它驻在南朝鲜的部队改编为“五单位原子师”。同时，美国还企图把它的导弹运入南朝鲜。这一切都说明，美国这样做的目的，是为了把南朝鲜变成它威胁亚洲和平的原子战争基地和导弹基地。
    朝中方面为维护朝鲜的和平，维护停战协定，同美国的这种破坏行为进行了不懈的斗争。美国军队和李承晚军队进行所谓原子“出击”演习和公开叫战，是吓不倒朝中人民的。这种好战姿态，除了使它自己在世界爱好和平的人民中间愈来愈陷于孤立以外，将得不到任何其他结果。美国将军在发出好战的叫嚣时，应该记住：朝中人民希望和平，但并不害怕战争。朝中人民过去既然有力量打退美国侵略者的进攻，终于实现了停战，今天就更有力量保卫朝鲜的和平。
