    Peaceful Use of Weapons
    Soviet Union Converts Submarine into Research Vessel
    Conducting Scientific Research of the Underwater World
    Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: According to TASS, the Soviet government has decided to convert a submarine into a research vessel for underwater scientific exploration. This underwater scientific research vessel is expected to be completed and set sail for its first voyage this summer.
    Various complex instruments will be installed on this vessel. A thick glass window will be installed at the bow. Several high-intensity searchlights will be installed outside the window. The light from the searchlights can be adjusted as needed. Scientists can sit in comfortable chairs near the window to observe the underwater world and take movies and photos. In addition to the general echo sounder, the ship will also be equipped with a special echo sounder. This instrument can detect depth upwards, so it can be used to measure schools of fish swimming in the water above the ship, and also obtain comparative data on the reflective capacity of the water surface.
    Scientists will also use special equipment on the ship to extract samples of water and seabed soil from various depths. They will also measure the temperature, salinity, and percentage of oxygen in the water at any speed and depth.
    Scientists will also use underwater television equipment to directly observe the direction of the ship's operation on a fluorescent screen inside the hull.

    和平利用武器
    苏联改装潜水艇为考察船
    进行水底世界的科学研究
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联政府已经决定把一艘潜水艇改装为考察船，进行水底的科学考察工作。在今年夏天，这艘水底科学考察船即将改装完成，并且出发作第一次航行。
    在这只船上，将安装各种复杂的仪器。在船头上开一个装厚玻璃的窗子。在窗外安装几盏光度很强的探照灯。探照灯的灯光可以根据需要加以调整。科学家坐在靠近窗子的安乐椅上就可以观察水底世界，进行拍摄电影和照片等工作。船上除了装有一般的回声测深器以外，还将装置一种特殊的回声测深器。这种仪器能够向上探测深度，因此可以利用它测出在这艘船的上面水中游动的鱼群，同时，也能得出水面反射能力的比较资料。
    科学家还将利用船上的一种特殊装备，提取各种深度的水和水底土壤的试样。他们还将在任何行驶速度和深度中。测量水的温度、含盐量和含氧的百分比。
    科学家们还将利用水底电视装置，直接在船身里的萤光屏上观察船艇的运行方向。
