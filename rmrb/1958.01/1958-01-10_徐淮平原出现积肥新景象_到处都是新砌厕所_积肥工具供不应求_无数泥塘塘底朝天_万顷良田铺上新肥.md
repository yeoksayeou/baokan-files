Xinhua News Agency report from its Jiangsu correspondent: In the Xuzhou-Huaiyin Plain, Jiangsu Province, spanning hundreds of miles, more than 1.8 million people are currently participating in an unprecedented manure accumulation campaign. Manure accumulation has become a revolutionary agricultural production increase measure in this area.

Along the more than 200-kilometer route from Xuzhou to Huaiyin, the reporter saw many agricultural cooperative members using water cans, ladles, and various iron cans to pour urine fertilizer onto wheat fields; many women even used a square cloth to hang up the four corners, replacing baskets, to send fertilizer to the fields. New toilets can be seen everywhere in the villages, with black manure piles stacked in front of and behind the houses, countless mud ponds with their bottoms up, and tens of thousands of acres of fertile land covered with new manure. Since the beginning of winter, the entire region has newly built 500,000 toilets, pigsties, and manure pits, but tools and materials for accumulating and applying fertilizer are still in short supply. Along the way, many earthen kilns can be seen emitting thick smoke, firing bricks for agricultural cooperatives to build toilets and manure pits; wooden sailboats on the canal are loaded with pottery manure jars and urine pots, continuing to be transported to the countryside.

Seven years ago, the reporter also traveled through many rural areas in this region, but at that time, there were few toilets that could be used for manure accumulation. In the past, this area suffered from severe floods, and often even the seeds could not be harvested in the autumn floods. Therefore, years of painful experiences gradually formed the masses' habit of extensive planting and low harvesting, and not paying attention to manure accumulation. The phenomenon of people without toilets and pigs without pens was common. According to a survey in Lianshui County, even in recent years, only 6% of farmers had liquid manure ponds, and more than 200 million jin of human urine were lost annually in the county, equivalent to the fertilizer effect of more than 15 million jin of soybean cakes.

In order to change this habit and create a manure accumulation atmosphere, many leading cadres personally built toilets. After Bao Youcheng, secretary of the Xinyi County Party Committee, visited a production team of the Xinnan Agricultural Cooperative, he saw that the toilets built by the members were actually just using firewood fences to enclose a piece of land, some with just an earthen pit inside, and some with two bricks placed on the ground, which could not effectively accumulate fertilizer. After discussing with the farmers, Bao Youcheng personally helped them bury a small jar underground, build a circle of bricks on top, and put two bricks in front to form a urine drainage channel, so that urine fertilizer could be completely stored. Then he mobilized more than 600 cadres from government offices to assist nearby agricultural cooperatives in comprehensively renovating toilets, and organized township and cooperative cadres to visit, acting as a commentator himself, asking each visitor to build one by hand to learn the method of building toilets. After the township and cooperative cadres returned, they all used their own actions to lead the masses in accumulating manure. The phenomenon that some women were shy about carrying urine jars has now quickly changed. Sanbao Township of Tongshan County launched a manure accumulation competition between cooperatives and teams. The Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative's fourteen production teams lit lanterns at night to rush to repair liquid manure ponds. In one week, more than 6,000 households in this township had toilets, and every one of the 180-plus production teams had manure pits. In 1955, the Minzhu Agricultural Cooperative in Suqian County had only twenty-odd liquid manure ponds. Now, all 700 households have liquid manure ponds and have developed the habit of carrying water to ferment manure. At present, the entire cooperative can accumulate 5,200 jin of urine fertilizer every day, and the urine fertilizer collected every day can be used as topdressing for ten acres of wheat fields. This cooperative applies 54 loads of base fertilizer per mu of wheat fields, exceeding the fertilizer application level of local wealthy middle peasants by four or five times.

In the Xuzhou-Huaiyin area, now every morning, when the sky is still twinkling with stars, old men and children are picking up manure. Young men and women invite each other to dig silt and send fertilizer. People tread on the frost, some carrying, some lifting. Hardworking female cooperative members get up in the dark, bake pancakes, and pick up a basket of manure before dawn. In various places, more women than men participate in manure accumulation. They proudly say: "Ten thousand carts of black mud bring a thousand jin of grain, the labor of girls is stronger than men's." The Xinxing Agricultural Cooperative and the Xinxing Fifth Agricultural Cooperative in Matou Township, Huaiyin County, jointly established a manure accumulation command post, organizing more than 200 people to continuously tread the waterwheel for six days and nights, draining a fifteen-mu pond and taking out the pond mud to fertilize the fields. The laborers on water conservancy construction sites such as the Erhe Dam also attach importance to manure accumulation. Wherever they dig, they pile up temporary toilets with earth blocks, and urine buckets are set up near the work sheds.

Cities, government offices, schools, and residents in the Xuzhou-Huaiyin area have also participated in this manure accumulation campaign. Forty-five cadres from the Daxing Town government in Suqian County continuously worked with the masses for three days to pick and dig pond silt, influencing 35 people in the town who had never participated in labor to join the movement. On New Year's Day, cadres from Qingjiang City also went down to the pond to pick black mud to accumulate fertilizer for farmers in the suburbs.

Since winter, the Xuzhou-Huaiyin area, including 21 counties and cities, has accumulated more than 460 million dan of fertilizer, creating conditions for increased grain production. This year, this area will convert nearly 2 million mu to rice cultivation, and grain output will increase from more than 5 billion jin in 1957 to 7.9 billion jin.

    徐淮平原出现积肥新景象
    到处都是新砌厕所　积肥工具供不应求
    无数泥塘塘底朝天　万顷良田铺上新肥
    新华社讯　新华社驻江苏记者报道：江苏省纵横数百里的徐（州）淮（阴）平原上，目前有一百八十多万人参加了空前规模的积肥运动。积肥已成为这个地区的一项革命性的农业增产措施。
    在从徐州到淮阴的两百多公里沿途，记者看到了许多农业社社员在用水罐、水瓢和各种铁罐往麦田里浇尿肥；很多妇女还用一块方布吊起四角，代替筐篮，向田里送肥。村庄里到处可以看到新砌的厕所，屋前屋后堆着一方方的黑色肥堆，无数的泥塘塘底朝天，万顷良田铺上了新肥。整个地区自从进入冬季以来，已经新砌厕所、猪圈和粪池五十万个，但是积肥、施肥用的工具和材料还是供不应求。沿途还可以看到许多土窑在冒着浓烟，为农业社烧制砌厕所、建粪池用的砖；运河里木帆船满载着陶制粪缸、尿罐，继续向农村里运送。
    七年前，记者也在这个地区走了许多农村，但是那时很少见到可以用来积肥的厕所。这个地区过去因为水灾严重，秋季一场大水，往往连种子也收不回来。因此，多少年来的惨痛遭遇逐渐形成了群众广种薄收、不重视积肥的习惯，人无厕所猪无圈是普遍现象。据涟水县调查，就是最近几年来也只有6％的农户有水粪塘，全县每年流失的人尿在两亿斤以上，等于一千五百多万斤豆饼的肥效。
    为了改变这种习惯，造成积肥的风气，许多领导干部都亲自动手砌厕所。中共新沂县委书记鲍有成访问了新南农业社的一个生产小组以后，看到社员们砌的厕所实际上只是用柴扉圈一块地，里面有的是个土坑，有的在平地上搁两块砖，不能很好地起到积肥作用。鲍有成和农民商量结果，就亲自帮助他们用一个小缸埋在地下，上面砌一圈砖，前面放两块砖做成一个淌尿道，这样就完全可以蓄住尿肥了。然后他又发动机关干部六百多人协助附近农业社全面改建厕所，并且组织乡、社干部参观，自己当讲解员，要参观的人每人动手砌一个，学会砌厕所的方法。乡、社干部回去后，都用自己的行动带领群众积肥。原来一些妇女羞于挑尿罐，现在这种现象很快就改变过来了。铜山县三堡乡社与社、队与队之间展开了积肥竞赛。新华农业社十四个生产队夜里打着灯笼赶修水粪塘。这个乡在一周时间内，六千多户，户户有了厕所，一百八十多个生产队，队队有了粪池。宿迁县民主农业社1955年只有二十多个水粪塘，现在七百多户家家都有了水粪塘，养成了挑水沤粪的习惯。目前全社每天能积尿肥五千二百斤，每天收的尿肥可以作十亩麦田的追肥用。这个社每亩麦田施基肥五十四挑，超过当地富裕中农施肥水平四、五倍。
    在徐淮地区，现在每天早晨当天空还闪烁着繁星的时候，就有老大爷和孩子们在拾粪了。青年男女互相邀约去挖淤送肥。人们踏着霜，挑的挑、抬的抬。勤劳的女社员摸黑起身，烙好煎饼，又拾回一筐粪天才大亮。各地参加积肥的妇女比男的多，她们自豪地说：“万车黑泥千斤粮，姑娘劳动比男子强”。淮阴县码头乡新兴农业社和新兴第五农业社联合成立了积肥指挥部，组织两百多人，连续踏车六昼夜，把十五亩大的一个水塘车干，把塘泥取出来肥田。二河闸等水利工地上的民工们也重视积肥，他们挖到那里，就用土块堆起临时厕所，工棚附近设有尿桶。
    徐淮地区各城市、机关、学校和居民也都参加了这个积肥运动。宿迁县大兴镇机关干部四十五人连续三天同群众一起挑挖汪淤，影响了镇上三十五个从未参加过劳动的人也投入运动。清江市机关干部，在元旦日也下塘挑黑泥，为郊区农民积肥。
    徐淮地区包括二十一个县市，冬季以来已积肥四亿六千多万担，为粮食增产创造了条件。今年这个地区要改种水稻近二百万亩，粮食产量要由1957年的五十多亿斤增加到七十九亿斤。
