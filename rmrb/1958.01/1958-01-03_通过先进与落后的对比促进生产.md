    Promote Production by Comparing the Advanced with the Backward
    Wang Pu
    The Industry and Transportation Departments of the CCP Jiande County Committee of Zhejiang Province and the CCP Tonglu County Committee, after in-depth investigation and research, grasped a large amount of data on oil extraction and brewing industries. From the comparison of the advanced and the backward, they found the potential of enterprise production, and proposed specific requirements and directions for increasing production and practicing economy to the enterprises. Subsequently, Tonglu Oil Factory and Tonglu Winery organized workers to discuss why the output rate was high or low under the same conditions, grasped the main links to improve the output rate, and took necessary technical and organizational measures. After the efforts of the workers, the output rate of oil and wine was indeed improved in a short period of time, increasing wealth for the country. This is a vivid example of promoting production development with promotional methods. This is a matter of universal significance.
    In the development process of any thing, balance is always temporary, while imbalance is constant and long-term. From imbalance to balance, and then from balance to imbalance on a new basis, progressing in a cycle, this is the law of development of things. Industrial production is also the same. Among many enterprises in the same industrial sector, and even between workshops and workshops, groups and groups, individuals and individuals in the same enterprise, there are differences between the advanced and the backward. The responsibility of leaders at all levels is to discover and analyze these differences, summarize and promote the experience of the advanced, and help the backward to move forward. With the spread of the experience of the advanced, and with the changes in the technical and management conditions of the enterprises, new differences will emerge on a new basis. The frequent appearance of these differences means that the production potential of the enterprises is endless. By fully exploring and utilizing these potentials, the production level of enterprises will continue to improve.
    We say that we Communists are promoters in all revolutionary undertakings. In industrial production, how to promote it? Only seeing the backward side of things, but not seeing the advanced side, sighing and complaining as soon as one hears about increasing production and practicing economy, of course, cannot promote the development of production; shouting "Forward!," "Cannot be conservative!" is also useless. A true promoter must grasp a large amount of data at all times, analyze and study these data, find out what are the advanced things, and why are they advanced? Find out what are the backward things, and why are they backward? Then, open up roads for advanced things, constantly point out the direction of advancement to the masses, put forward specific requirements, encourage the advanced to become more advanced, and help and spur the backward to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced. The Industry and Transportation Departments of the CCP Jiande County Committee and Tonglu County Committee promoted the development of the oil and wine industries in this way. We are introducing their experience to everyone here, the purpose is to hope that all production enterprises should do everything possible to tap production potential and promote production more, faster, better, and more economically.

    通过先进与落后的对比促进生产
    王朴
    中共浙江省建德地委工业交通部和桐庐县委工业交通部，经过深入的调查研究，掌握了制油和酿酒工业生产的大量资料，从先进与落后的对比中，找到了企业生产的潜力，向企业提出具体的增产节约要求和方向。接着，桐庐油厂和桐庐酒厂组织职工讨论为什么在同样条件下，出品率有高有低的问题，抓住提高出品率的主要环节，并采取了必要的技术组织措施。经过职工们的努力，果然在短期内提高了油、酒的出品率，为国家增加了财富。这是一个用促进办法推动生产发展的生动例子。这是一件具有普遍意义的事情。
    任何事物在发展过程中，平衡总是暂时的，不平衡则是经常的、长期的。从不平衡到平衡，在新的基础上又从平衡到不平衡，循环前进，这就是事物的发展规律。工业生产也是这样。在同一个工业部门的许多企业之间，甚至在同一个企业的车间与车间之间、小组与小组之间、个人与个人之间，都存在着先进与落后的差别。各级领导者的责任，就是发现和分析这种差别，总结和推广先进者的经验，帮助落后者前进。随着先进者的经验的传播，随着企业的技术条件和管理条件的改变，又会在新的基础上出现新的差别。这种差别的经常出现，就意味着企业的生产潜力是无穷无尽的。充分地发掘和利用这些潜力，企业的生产水平就会不断提高。
    我们说，我们共产党人在一切革命事业上都是促进派。在工业生产上，怎样促进法呢？只看到事物落后的一面，而看不见先进的一面，一听到要增产节约，就唉声叹气，固然不能促进生产的发展，空喊“前进啊”、“不能保守啊”也无济于事。真正的促进派，就要时时刻刻掌握大量的资料，分析和研究这些资料，找出哪些是先进的东西，为什么先进？找出哪些是落后的东西，为什么落后？然后为先进的事物开辟道路，不断地给群众指明前进的方向，提出具体的要求，鼓励先进者更加先进，帮助和鞭策落后者向先进者学习，赶上先进。中共建德地委和桐庐县委工业交通部就是这样促进油、酒工业的发展的。我们在这里向大家介绍他们的经验，目的就是希望一切生产企业应当千方百计地挖掘生产潜力，又多又快又好又省地促进生产。
