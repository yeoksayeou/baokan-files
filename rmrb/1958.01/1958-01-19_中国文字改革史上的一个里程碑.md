A Milestone in the History of Chinese Character Reform
Gao Chongmin

The "Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" has been published by the State Council. In terms of character reform work, this is another major event following the simplification of Chinese characters and the promotion of Mandarin Chinese. This scheme is a milestone in the history of Chinese character reform, and it will play an epoch-making role in popularizing and improving the culture of the people throughout the country. I wholeheartedly support this scheme and hope that it will be actively and steadily promoted throughout the country in order to rapidly improve the cultural level of the people.

The reform of Chinese characters is an objective requirement of historical development and a major issue that no one can ignore. Of course, no one can deny that Chinese culture, recorded by Chinese characters for thousands of years, has made brilliant and great contributions to mankind. But no one can fail to acknowledge that, in the face of modern science and technology, Chinese culture has lagged behind by almost a whole century. The main reason for this is that the long-term lack of development in production was the result of reactionary rule throughout the ages. After the Opium War, domestic reactionaries colluded with imperialism to even more cruelly destroy the vitality of the people, so that cultural development became increasingly backward. On the other hand, the difficulty of Chinese characters is not conducive to the learning and utilization of the vast majority of people, and to a certain extent limits the development of Chinese culture. Since liberation, with the guarantee and promotion of the socialist system, the material and cultural living standards of our people have been unprecedentedly improved, and fundamental changes have taken place compared with the old era. However, it has become increasingly clear that if the difficulty of learning Chinese characters is not quickly eliminated for the vast majority of people, the speed of improving culture will be greatly affected. As a tool, writing does not play a decisive role in the rise and fall of a country's culture, but it has a significant impact, as has long been proven by the history of various countries. Generally speaking, characters that are easy to recognize, remember, and write are beneficial to the cultural development of their countries, especially in the current era of rapid scientific and technological development and fierce competition. Compared with the writing of other countries that use alphabetic writing, the main shortcomings of Chinese characters are that they are difficult to recognize, remember, and write. Not to mention that an elementary school graduate who has studied Chinese for four years cannot write even a simple letter, even intellectuals who have spent ten years studying often forget how to write the characters. The reason for this is that the structure of Chinese characters is complex, and they cannot well express pronunciation from the shape of the characters. For example, the commonly used characters "鑿" (záo) and "鬰" (yù) have more than nineteen strokes, which are really complicated; and the characters "力" (lì, strength) and "历" (lì, history) have different shapes but the same pronunciation; the character "会" (huì) in "开会" (kāihuì, meeting) and the character "会" (kuài) in "会计" (kuàijì, accounting) have the same shape but different pronunciations, which are all difficult to master. If such difficult-to-learn characters are not reformed, they will inevitably hinder the popularization and improvement of the cultural level of the people throughout the country. Many advanced figures in our country have long recognized this, so there has been a constant movement for character reform over the past sixty years. They have made immortal efforts to reduce or eliminate the difficulty for people to learn Chinese characters and to strive to catch up with the cultural level of advanced countries. "Phonetic Symbols," "Gwoyeu Romatzyh," and "Latinxua Sin Wenz" are all the results of efforts during this period. In particular, "Phonetic Symbols" have played a great role in helping our people learn to read and unify the pronunciation of Chinese.

China's character reform has now entered a new stage. In the past, character reform work was carried out by only a few people in a very narrow range, without the support of the reactionary government and lacking a mass base. Although some efforts were made and many achievements were made, it still could not form a large-scale reform movement, so it was still far from the desire to popularize and improve the cultural level of the whole people. After the founding of New China, the Party and the government not only actively supported character reform, but also listed it as an important project of socialist cultural construction. It convened a national character reform conference and established the Chinese Character Reform Committee to organize a large number of experts to specialize in character reform research. Therefore, in the seventh year after the founding of the country, it was able to publish and implement a complete scheme for simplifying Chinese characters. In the same year, it also carried out a large-scale work of promoting Mandarin Chinese. At the end of 1957, it also published a scientific draft scheme for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet. Judging from the development process of this matter alone, it is enough to prove the importance the Party and the government attach to character reform, and it makes us fully believe that under the leadership of the Party and the government, it is fully capable of completing this character reform work with great historical significance. Our character reform work starts from the interests of socialism and the wishes of all the people. Because the people have improved their living standards, they urgently demand to improve their cultural level, so our character reform work has been wholeheartedly supported by the masses from the beginning, and has achieved great results in a short period of time. For example, the 355 simplified Chinese characters that have been officially implemented have been widely adopted by the masses. Millions of people across the country have learned Mandarin Chinese through broadcasting, and a large number of primary and secondary school teachers are teaching in Mandarin Chinese. After the Chinese Character Reform Committee announced the first draft in February 1956, millions of people have learned the phonetic alphabet and used it to learn Mandarin Chinese.

The Party and the government's policy on character reform is firm, and the steps and methods are sound and scientific, that is, characters must be reformed, but absolutely not take an impractical and rash approach, but proceed step by step in a planned way. The three main tasks of character reform at present: simplifying Chinese characters, promoting Mandarin Chinese, and formulating a Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, are a scientific measure to actively and steadily reform characters. These three tasks are closely related to each other. Simplifying Chinese characters is to improve the currently used Chinese characters, such as changing "壓" (yā, to press) to "压" (yā) and unifying the two ways of writing "喫" (chī, to eat) and "吃" (chī) to "吃" (chī), which facilitates the learning and use of the vast majority of people. The promotion of Mandarin Chinese is to have a unified standard in phonetics, grammar, and vocabulary for the Han nationality, so that the difficulties caused by dialect barriers that occur in the mutual contact of people in various regions can be resolved. The phonetic scheme is to annotate Chinese characters, to help literacy and unify pronunciation. These three tasks are all to enable the vast majority of people to learn and use Chinese characters more quickly, promote the standardization of Chinese, and facilitate the development of production, popularization, and improvement of culture.

I support the phonetic alphabet scheme because it is convenient to spell when using the Latin alphabet to annotate Chinese characters, and adults and children can master it in a relatively short period of time; at the same time, it is also conducive to international cultural exchanges. Some people are not used to the Latin alphabet and think it is a foreign character. I think habit is cultivated by time. At first, everyone was not used to the phonetic symbols, and now many people are used to it, because they have been in contact with it for a long time. Facts have proved that it is very easy to learn the phonetic alphabet with the Latin alphabet. According to statistics, it generally only takes eight to sixteen hours, at most less than twenty hours, to understand Mandarin Chinese reading materials annotated and spelled with the phonetic alphabet. Therefore, I not only wholeheartedly support this scheme, but also strive to learn this scheme. Finally, in terms of simplifying Chinese characters, I think there are still some places that need to be discussed. Some simplified characters deviate from the principle of "conventional usage", such as the character "書" (shū, book) is generally simplified to "?", but now it is simplified to "?", which looks very awkward, and it is better to simplify it to "?" as before. Such simplifications should be carefully considered. In addition, in order to smoothly promote the scheme of simplifying Chinese characters, it should be stipulated that except for the simplified characters officially announced by the government, no individual, agency, organization, or school shall arbitrarily create simplified characters and abuse them, so as to avoid confusion and be detrimental to the work of character reform.

    中国文字改革史上的一个里程碑
    高崇民
    “汉语拼音方案草案”已由国务院公布了，在文字改革工作上，这是继简化汉字、推广普通话以后的又一件大事。这个方案是中国文字改革史上的一个里程碑，它对于普及和提高全国人民的文化，将起着划时代的作用。我衷心地拥护这个方案，并希望在全国范围内积极稳步地推行这个方案，以期迅速地提高人民的文化水平。
    汉字必须改革，乃是历史发展的客观要求，是任何人都不能忽视的重大问题。当然，谁也不能否认，由汉字记留下来的具有数千年历史的中国文化，对人类的贡献是辉煌伟大的。但是谁也不能不承认，在现代的科学技术面前，中国文化几乎落后了整整的一个世纪。其原因主要是历代的反动统治使生产长期得不到发展的结果。鸦片战争以后，国内反动派与帝国主义勾结起来，更加残酷地摧毁了人民的生机，以致文化的发展就日益落后。另一方面，中国文字之难，不利于广大人民的学习和利用，在一定程度上限制了中国文化的发展。解放以后，我国人民在社会主义制度的保障和推动下，物质和文化生活水平都有了空前的提高，与旧时代相比已经发生了根本的变化。可是越来越清楚地看出，假设不为广大人民迅速排除学习汉字的困难，提高文化的速度就会受到很大的影响。文字作为一种工具来看，它对于一国文化的兴衰虽不起决定性的作用，但却有着重大的影响，这个事实早为各国的历史所证明。一般地说，凡是容易认识、记忆和书写的文字，对其国家的文化发展就是有利的，特别是在现在科学技术飞跃发展和进行着剧烈竞赛的时代里，其情况尤其如此。汉字与其他用拼音文字的国家的文字比较起来，主要缺点是难认、难记和难写，不用说一个学过四年汉语的初小毕业生连一封粗浅的书信写不通，就是有过十年寒窗的知识分子也常常提笔忘字，其原因就是汉字构造复杂，不能从字形上很好地表示读音，如常用的“鑿”和“鬰”两字，笔画都在十九画以上，实在不胜繁复；再如“力、历”两字的字形不同，而字音相同；开会的“会”与会计的“会”，字形相同，而字音又不同，这些都是很难掌握的。像这样难学的文字，如不进行改革，势必阻碍着普及和提高全国人民的文化水平。我国的许多先进人物早已有见于此，所以六十年来就不断有文字改革的运动。他们为减少或免除人民学习汉字的困难，为争取赶上先进国家的文化水平，作过不朽的努力，如“注音字母”、“国语罗马字”、“拉丁化新文字”等，都是这一时期努力的结果。特别是“注音字母”，在帮助我国人民识字和统一汉语的读音方面，起过很大的作用。
    我国的文字改革在现在已经跨入了一个崭新的阶段。过去的文字改革工作，只是少数人在极狭隘的范围内进行，既得不到反动政府的支持，又缺乏广大群众的基础，虽然做了一些努力，也收到不少成绩，但是尚不能形成规模宏大的改革运动，故距离普及和提高全民文化水平的愿望还很远。新中国成立以后，党和政府不仅积极支持文字改革，而且把它列为社会主义文化建设的重要项目之一，召开了全国性的文字改革会议，设立了中国文字改革委员会，组织大批专家来专门从事文字改革的研究工作。因此，在建国后的第七年，就能公布和推行一套完整的汉字简化方案，同年又进行了大规模的推广普通话的工作，在1957年底又公布了一套科学的汉语拼音方案草案。单从这件事情的发展过程来看，亦足证党和政府对文字改革的重视，更使我们充分地相信在党和政府的领导下，完全能够完成这个具有伟大历史意义的文字改革工作。我们的文字改革工作是从社会主义的利益和全体人民的愿望出发的。因为人民提高了生活水平，就迫切地要求提高文化水平，所以我们的文字改革工作，一开始就获得了群众竭诚地拥护，并在短期内收到了很大成绩。例如已经正式推行的三百五十五个简化汉字，已被广大群众普遍采用，全国已有几百万人通过广播学习了普通话，还有很大一部分中小学教师都用普通话进行教学，中国文字改革委员会在1956年2月公布第一个草案以后，已有几百万人学会了拼音字母，并用来学习普通话。
    党和政府对文字改革的方针是坚定的，步骤和方法是稳妥和科学的，就是文字一定要改革，但绝不采取脱离实际的冒进方式，而是逐步有计划地进行。当前文字改革的三项主要任务：简化汉字、推广普通话、制定汉语拼音方案，就是一个积极稳步地改革文字的科学措施。这三个任务互相都有密切的联系。简化汉字是为改良现在通用的汉字，如“壓”改为“压”，“喫”和“吃”的两种写法统一为“吃”等，这样就便利于广大人民的学习和使用。推广普通话是为了汉族在语音、语法和语汇上有一个统一的标准，这样就可以解除由于方言的隔阂，而使各地区人民在相互接触中发生的困难。拼音方案是为汉字注音，是为了帮助识字和统一读音的。这三个任务，都是为了使广大人民更迅速地学习和使用汉字，促进汉语的规范化，以利于发展生产、普及和提高文化。
    我拥护拼音方案，是因为使用拉丁字母为汉字注音时拼写方便，成人和儿童都可以在较短的时期内掌握；同时也有利于国际文化交流。有些人不习惯拉丁字母，认为它是外国字。我以为习惯是时间养成的，当初的注音字母大家也并不习惯，而现在有不少人也习惯了，因为与它接触时间长了的关系。事实证明，用拉丁字母拼音是很容易学的，据统计，一般只要学习八至十六小时，至多不到二十来个小时，就能看懂用拼音字母注音、拼写的普通话读物。所以，我不仅衷心拥护这个方案，并要努力学习这个方案。最后，在简化汉字方面，我认为还有待商榷的地方，有些简字离开了“约定俗成”的原则，如“書”字一般都简写为“?”，而现在简化为“?”，看起来很别扭，实不如照旧简化为“?”更好一些。像这样的简化似应当慎重考虑。此外为了顺利推行汉字简化方案，应当规定除尽量使用政府公布的简字以外，任何人或机关、团体和学校都不得任意创造简字而加以滥用，以免发生混乱，不利于文字改革工作。
