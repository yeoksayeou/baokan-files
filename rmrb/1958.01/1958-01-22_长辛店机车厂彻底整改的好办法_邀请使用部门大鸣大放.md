    Good Way to Thoroughly Rectify Changxindian Locomotive Factory:
    Invite User Departments to Fully Air Their Views
    (Our Newspaper's Report) In the first half of this month, the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory invited relevant user departments to hold two airing-of-views meetings, which achieved good results.
    The factory's business is to repair locomotives and rolling stock for dozens of railway administrations or locomotive depots and sections across the country. In the past, the relationship between the repair factory and the user departments was not well-coordinated: user departments often complained that the repair factory neglected repair quality, and the repair factory often said that the user departments were nitpicking and did not understand their actual difficulties. During this rectification period, in order to improve the relationship with the user departments, to listen to their opinions, and to improve its work, the Changxindian Rolling Stock Factory decided to invite relevant user departments to hold airing-of-views meetings. More than 40 representatives from more than 20 units of the North China, Northeast, East China, Central South and Inner Mongolia railway systems, as well as representatives from four fraternal factories in Huangguantun, Jinan, Zhuzhou and Tangshan, participated in the airing-of-views meetings. The representatives were mostly inspection engineers, chief engineers, or general engineers.
    Now, the airing-of-views stage has ended. In the area of locomotive repair alone, the representatives put forward nearly 250 suggestions. The factory leaders are classifying and studying these criticisms and suggestions. Improvements that can be made immediately are being made immediately; those that require careful analysis and research are also being handled by dedicated personnel.
    Through such airing-of-views meetings, not only has the relationship between the repair factory and the user departments been improved, and problems that have been unresolved for a long time have been solved, but it has also played a significant role in educating the factory's enterprise management cadres and the majority of employees to continue to carry forward their strengths and overcome their shortcomings.
    Through this airing-of-views meeting, the factory's enterprise leaders realized that in arranging production, they should not only consider the interests of their own enterprise, but also consider the user departments, and the socialist spirit of cooperation has become clearer. A fact revealed by Wang Zilong, an inspection engineer from the Xuzhou Locomotive Depot at the meeting, was a great inspiration to the factory's leaders. In the fourth quarter of last year, a locomotive from this locomotive depot was transferred to the factory for major repairs. After the repairs, the quality of the locomotive was up to standard in other aspects, but there was a problem with the oil core. Originally, the oil core of this locomotive was rough, and in general, it needed to be blocked, welded, and opened, which would only cost a few yuan. However, in order to save these few yuan and to save trouble, the Changxindian Repair Factory only inlaid a piece of metal. After the locomotive left the factory, it had problems when it reached Tianjin, and it was stopped for two days for repairs. Later, it was repaired for another two days in Jinan, and another three days when it returned to Xuzhou. It was stopped for seven days in total, and the loss of depreciation and maintenance costs alone was more than 4,000 yuan; if calculated at 2,000 tons of goods transported 400 kilometers per day, the loss of freight profit for seven days would be 80,000 yuan. The oil core accident burned a pair of copper tiles, and it cost 700 yuan to replace them with a new pair. The repair factory saved a few yuan, but the resulting loss was 84,000 yuan.
    The facts revealed in the airing-of-views show that the factory should strengthen its cooperation with the user departments. Some problems may seem simple to the factory, but they are very serious to the user departments. For example, the factory believes that the suction box on the locomotive can be installed on the front or rear of the locomotive; however, if it is placed on the rear, it will greatly affect the user department's furnace cleaning work, and a large number of parts must be disassembled when cleaning the furnace due to the obstruction of the suction box. Another example is the oiling of the wheels. The factory always applies a lot of oil, but the user departments believe that this is adding trouble to them. If there is too much oil, it must be wiped frequently, and a few more kilograms of cotton yarn strips will be used, which will increase management costs. There are also cases where repairs are not made when they should be, and replacements are not made when they should be. As long as the user department makes a good introduction to the repair factory before the locomotive enters the factory for repairs, the problem can be solved. At this meeting, everyone believed that the cooperation between the factory and the depot was very necessary; in the future, when the depot hands over the locomotive to the factory for repairs, it must also provide the necessary information for the repairs. The representatives who attended the meeting also believed that it would not work if the factory repaired the locomotive well, but the depot did not maintain it well. While improving the quality of repairs, the maintenance work should also be strengthened. The Changxindian Repair Factory also promised that in the future, when locomotives and rolling stock are repaired and leave the factory, they will take the initiative to introduce the situation to the user departments for any new technologies and new equipment used, and will also attach instructions when necessary.
    Most of the representatives who attended the meeting believed that every unit, regardless of its nature, would have certain relationships with other units. Where there are relationships, there are contradictions. To resolve contradictions, airing views freely is a very effective method. They have all expressed that they will follow the practice of the Changxindian Rolling Stock Factory after returning, and invite relevant units to conduct airing-of-views on their own bureaus, sections, and depots.

    长辛店机车厂彻底整改的好办法
    邀请使用部门大鸣大放
    本报讯　长辛店机车车辆修理工厂在本月上中旬，邀集有关使用部门举行了两次鸣放会议，收到了良好的效果。
    这个工厂的业务，是给全国几十个铁路管理局或机务处、段修理机车车辆。过去，这个修理厂同使用部门之间的关系不够协调：使用部门常常埋怨修理工厂忽视修车质量，修理厂又常说使用部门吹毛求疵，不体谅他们的实际困难。这次整改期间，长辛店车辆厂为了改善同使用部门的关系，为了听取使用部门的意见，改进工作，决定邀请有关使用部门举行鸣放会议。参加鸣放会议的，有华北、东北、华东、中南和内蒙古铁路系统的二十多个单位的四十多名代表，还有皇姑屯、济南、株洲、唐山四个兄弟工厂的代表。代表们多是检修工程师、主任工程师或总工程师。
    现在，鸣放阶段已经结束。仅在机车修理方面，代表们就提出了近二百五十项意见。修理厂领导方面正在对这些批评建议进行分类研究。马上可以改进的立即改进；需要仔细分析研究的，也有专人负责处理。
    通过这样的鸣放会议，不仅改善了修理厂同使用部门之间的关系，解决了过去长期悬而未决的问题；而且对教育修理厂企业管理干部和广大职工继续发扬优点，克服缺点，起了重大的作用。
    这个厂的企业领导人员经过这次鸣放会议，认识到在安排生产的时候，不仅要考虑本企业的利益，还要为使用部门设想，社会主义的协作思想更加明确了。徐州机务段检修工程师王子龙在会上揭发出来的一件事实，对于这个厂的领导人员就是很大的启发。去年第四季度，这个机务段有一台机车调到这个厂里来大修。经过修理以后，这台车其他方面的质量都符合要求，可是油芯出了问题。原来这台车的油芯孔粗旷，在一般情况下，需要堵焊开孔，这样做只要花几元的成本。但是长辛店修理工厂为了省这几元钱，为了省事，只镶了一块金属片。机车出厂以后，走到天津就出了问题，停车两天进行修理，后来到了济南又修了两天，回到徐州又修了三天。先后停车七天，仅折旧、维护费就损失了四千多元；若以每天拉两千吨货物走四百公里计算，七天损失的货运利润达八万元。油芯事故，烧毁了一对铜瓦，花了七百元换了对新铜瓦。修理工厂省了几元钱，造成的损失却是八万四千多元。
    鸣放中揭发的事实说明，工厂应该切实加强同使用部门的配合。有些问题，在工厂看来很简单，但在使用部门却很严重。如火车头上的吸风箱，工厂认为装在车头的前部和后部都可以；但是如果放在后部，对使用部门的洗炉工作影响就很大，在洗炉的时候，由于吸风箱碍事，就要拆卸一大片部件。又如车轮涂油，工厂总是涂得很多，在使用部门却认为这是给他们增加麻烦，油多了，必须经常擦拭，多用几斤棉纱条，又会增加管理费用。还有当修不修，当换不换等情况，只要使用部门在机车入厂修理以前向修理厂作好介绍，问题就能解决。这次会议上，大家认为厂段配合是十分必要的；今后段上交车给工厂修理，也必须提供修车的必要资料。到会的代表还认为，工厂修得好，段上保养得不好也不成，在提高修车质量的同时，也应该加强保养工作。长辛店修理厂也保证，今后机车车辆修理竣工出厂，凡是采用了新技术新设备的，就主动向使用部门介绍情况，必要时还附寄说明书。
    到会的多数代表认为：每个单位，不论其性质如何，都会同其他单位发生一定的关系，有关系，就有矛盾，要解决矛盾，大鸣大放是一个很有效的办法。他们纷纷表示，在回去以后将仿效长辛店车辆厂的做法，邀请有关单位对本局、本处、本段进行鸣放。
