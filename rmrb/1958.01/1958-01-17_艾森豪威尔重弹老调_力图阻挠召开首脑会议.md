    Eisenhower Repeats Old Tune
    Tries to Obstruct Summit Conference
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th: U.S. President Eisenhower reiterated the U.S. government's attitude of trying its best to obstruct and delay the holding of a top-level meeting at a press conference on the 15th.
    When talking about the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a meeting of heads of government as early as possible, he emphasized that he believed "a series of preparations" should be made before such a meeting could be held. He said that first, "normal diplomatic procedures" or "preliminary ambassador-level meetings" should be conducted, and then a foreign ministers' meeting should be held for "preparation." He continued, saying that finally, the foreign ministers' meeting must "show" the United States that holding a top-level meeting is "beneficial" before the United States would participate in such a meeting.
    When talking about the possibility of East-West government talks, he also said that the United States "will never" conduct talks with China at a top-level meeting at the present time.
    At Eisenhower's first press conference in nearly two and a half months, a reporter from the New York "Daily News" asked him whether Dulles was going to resign, the reporter said that "criticism of Dulles is increasing" both domestically and abroad.
    Eisenhower turned red when answering this question, and said that talk about Dulles resigning was "nonsense", and he "least wanted" Dulles to resign, and Dulles was "fit" to continue in office. He praised this die-hard Secretary of State, who opposed negotiations with the Soviet Union and insisted on the "Cold War," as "the wisest and most dedicated person he knew."
    A reporter asked Eisenhower whether the situation he had faced in the five years since he took office, due to artificial satellites, the Little Rock incident, etc., was quite difficult. Eisenhower acknowledged this in his reply. He vaguely mentioned that the "policy of strength" pursued by the United States "has also been criticized," and the United States' "propaganda materials are often contradictory," and therefore "this period has been very difficult." He admitted that the pursuit of this policy had created "economic difficulties," preventing the United States from "undertaking some great constructive endeavors."

    艾森豪威尔重弹老调
    力图阻挠召开首脑会议
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔15日在记者招待会上，重申美国政府想竭力阻挠和拖延召开最高级会议的态度。
    他在谈到苏联关于及早召开政府首脑会议的建议时强调，他认为要召开这种会议，先要进行“一系列的准备工作”。他说，首先要通过“正常的外交程序”或者“初步的大使级会议”，再还要举行外长会议进行“准备”。他接着说，最后还必须通过外长会议向美国“表明”举行最高级会议是“有益的”，美国才会参加这种会议。
    他在谈到东西方政府会谈的可能性时还说，美国“决不会”在目前同中国在最高级会议上进行会谈。
    在艾森豪威尔近两个半月以来第一次举行的记者招待会上，纽约“每日新闻”记者向他提出杜勒斯是否要辞职的问题，这个记者说，美国国内和国外“对杜勒斯的批评越来越多了”。
    艾森豪威尔在回答这个问题时涨红了脸，他说，有关杜勒斯要辞职的谈论是“废话”，他“最不希望”杜勒斯辞职，杜勒斯“适合于”继续留任。他把这个死硬反对同苏联谈判、坚持“冷战”的国务卿，赞誉为他“所知道的最明智而最忠于事业的人”。
    有记者问艾森豪威尔，在他就任总统五年以来由于人造卫星、小石城事件等，他所面临的局势是否是相当艰难的。艾森豪威尔在答复中承认这一点。他含糊地谈到，美国所奉行的“实力政策”“也受到批评”，美国的“宣传材料时常是相互矛盾的”，因而“这段时间情况是很艰难的”。他承认，由于奉行这种政策产生了“经济困难”，使美国“不能进行一些伟大的建设性的事业”。
