A New Face of Colonialism

According to a UPI report, two agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation have arrived in Amman at the invitation of King Hussein of Jordan to serve as his bodyguards. Hussein, in the "company" of these two American agents, visited the city of Hebron on the West Bank of the Jordan River on the 16th.

Whether these two American agents were invited or came uninvited is highly questionable. But, in any case, the fact that the King of Jordan must have two American agents as bodyguards is very indicative of the King's situation.

The United States has used both dollars and gunboats to control Jordan, and now it has sent agents to be the King's bodyguards. This can truly be said to be another new face of American colonialists.

    殖民主义新面目
    据合众社报道，美国联邦调查局的两个特务已应邀到达安曼，担任了约旦国王侯赛因的保镖。侯赛因并在这两个美国特务的“陪伴”下，于16日到约旦河西岸的赫布隆城去访问。
    这两个美国特务究竟是应邀还是不请自来，这是很可怀疑的。但是，无论如何，约旦的国王必须由两个美国特务保镖，这很可以说明这位国王的处境了。
    美国为了控制约旦，美元和炮舰的手段都用过了，现在又派了特务作国王的保镖，这真可以说是美国殖民主义者的又一个新面目了。
