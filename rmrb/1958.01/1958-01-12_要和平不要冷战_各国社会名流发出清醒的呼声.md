London Dispatch: Bertrand Russell, the renowned British philosopher, delivered a televised address in London on the evening of January 9th, advocating for the abolition of nuclear weapons. He stated that if the threat of the hydrogen bomb could be eliminated, "humanity could face a greater future than ever before."

Russell said that it is not in Britain's national interest to manufacture atomic weapons. He expressed his hope that Britain would abandon the production and possession of atomic bombs and use this influence to encourage other countries to abolish such weapons together. He also hoped that the United States and the Soviet Union would work together to abolish nuclear weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, London, January 10th: Aneurin Bevan, the British Labour Party's spokesman on foreign affairs, said in a radio address on the evening of January 9th that if the Labour Party regains power, they will implement a policy of stopping nuclear tests, hoping that other countries will immediately follow Britain's example.

Bevan also spoke about the issue of holding summit talks with the Soviet Union. He said that while he agreed to holding foreign minister-level talks before holding summit talks, the date for such summit talks should be determined in advance, otherwise the lower-level talks would not produce any results.

He also refuted the claim that the Soviet Union would not respect agreements, saying that, based on experience, the Soviet Union does respect agreements.

Bevan said that signing a non-aggression treaty would be an excellent idea.

Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: Washington Dispatch: Senator John Sparkman, a member of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Democratic Senator, said on January 9th that US President Dwight Eisenhower should show the Soviet Union and the world that "the United States is ready to negotiate our [US-Soviet] differences at any time."

Referring to Dulles' recent remarks before the House Foreign Affairs Committee that holding summit talks with the Soviet Union now would be futile, Sparkman pointed out that this attitude was "wrong" because "a negative attitude will get the United States nowhere."

Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: According to TASS, London, January 10th: British Conservative MP Christopher Busby published an article in the "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" advocating that Western countries should make every effort to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on issues such as establishing a neutral zone in Central Europe, neutralizing Germany, and expanding trade between East and West.

Busby sharply criticized the policies pursued by Western countries, mainly the United States and Britain, saying that this policy is an unrealistic and short-sighted policy.

Busby concluded: "In the political sphere, neutralize Central Europe; in the military sphere, withdraw troops; in the economic sphere, develop East-West trade: this is the way forward that gives hope."

    要和平不要冷战
    各国社会名流发出清醒的呼声
    罗素再主张
    废除核武器
    新华社10日讯
  伦敦消息：英国著名哲学家罗素9日晚间在伦敦发表电视广播演说，主张废除核武器。他说，如果能够解除氢弹的威胁，“人类就可以面对一个前所未有的更伟大的未来”。
    罗素说：英国制造原子武器是不符合国家的利益的。他表示希望英国放弃生产和握有原子弹，并且利用这种影响来促使其他国家一起废除这种武器。他同时希望美国和苏联在废除核武器方面共同努力。
  比万宣扬停止
  核试验的政策
    据新华社伦敦10日电　英国工党外交问题发言人比万1月9日晚间在广播演说中说，如果工党重新执政，他们将执行停止核试验的政策，希望其他国家会因而立即效法英国。
    比万还谈到同苏联举行最高级会谈的问题。他说：虽然他同意在举行最高级会谈之前先举行外长级的会谈，但是，这种最高级会谈的日期还是应该先行确定，否则较低级的会谈就不会产生什么效果。
    他还驳斥了所谓苏联会不尊重协议的说法，他说，根据经验，苏联是尊重协议的。
    比万说，签订互不侵犯条约是个极好的主意。
    斯巴克曼要求美政府同苏联谈判
    据新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国参议院外交委员会委员、民主党参议员斯巴克曼9日说，美国总统艾森豪威尔应当向苏联和全世界表明：“美国随时准备就我们（美苏之间）的分歧进行谈判。”
    谈到杜勒斯最近在众议院外交委员会说的现在同苏联举行最高级会谈是徒劳的这番话时，斯巴克曼指出，这种态度是“错误”的，因为“否定的态度将使美国什么也得不到手。”
      布斯比主张东西方会谈
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社伦敦10日讯：英国保守党议员布斯比在“每日电讯与晨邮报”上发表文章，主张西方国家竭尽一切努力就建立中欧中立区、德国中立化和扩大东西方之间的贸易这样一些问题同苏联达成协议。
    布斯比尖锐抨击西方国家，主要是美国和英国所奉行的政策，他说这种政策是一种不现实的近视的政策。
    布斯比最后说：“在政治方面使中欧中立化；在军事方面撤退军队；在经济方面发展东西方贸易：这就是使人产生希望的前进的道路。”
