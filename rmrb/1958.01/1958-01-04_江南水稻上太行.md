Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd: Rice from the south of the Yangtze River is being prepared for large-scale planting in the arid Taihang Mountains. Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, located in the Taihang Mountain area, has historically been dry and has little rainfall. After agricultural cooperativization, the region carried out large-scale basic farmland water conservancy construction, diverting water to the mountains, and as a result, rice from the south has begun to grow here. In 1957, more than one hundred agricultural cooperatives in the region planted four thousand mu of rice, and most achieved a bumper harvest. According to the region's plan, it will be possible to develop this to thirty-six thousand mu in 1958, with an average yield of four hundred jin per mu. By 1962, the region's rice planting area can be expanded to two million mu. At that time, the output from rice paddies alone will be equivalent to more than 89% of the region's total grain output in 1957.

    江南水稻上太行
    据新华社太原3日电　干旱的太行山上准备大量种植水稻。位于太行山区的山西省长治专区，向来干旱少雨。在农业合作化后，这个地区大规模地开展农田水利基本建设，引水上山，江南的水稻因此在这里生长起来。1957年，全区有一百多个农业社种植了四千亩水稻，大部分获得丰收。根据全区的规划，1958年将可发展到三万六千亩，平均每亩产四百斤，到1962年，全区水稻种植面积就可发展到二百万亩。那时，全区仅水稻田的产量，就相当于1957年全区粮食总产量的89％以上。
