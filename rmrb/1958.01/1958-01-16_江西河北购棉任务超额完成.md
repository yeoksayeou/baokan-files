Jiangxi and Hebei Exceed Cotton Purchase Quotas

    (From our newspaper) Nanchang, Jiangxi -- As of December 25th, Jiangxi farmers had sold 380,058 dan of ginned cotton to the state, exceeding the state-assigned unified purchase quota of 300,000 dan. This represents a 10.16% increase compared to the actual purchase volume in 1956. Jiangxi Province experienced an unprecedented bumper cotton harvest last year, with total production exceeding the original target set in the First Five-Year Plan by 22%. The cotton is white in color, well-matured, with low impurity and moisture content, and generally very clean. The broad masses of cotton farmers have adhered to the principle of "country first, self second," selling more and keeping less, retaining inferior cotton and selling the better cotton, actively and quickly selling their cotton to the state. Many cotton farmers in Jinxian County retained only one jin of cotton per person, and some sold all their cotton to the state because they had cotton reserves.

    The cotton purchasing work has also been greatly improved compared to the past. Cotton farmer representative meetings were held in various cotton-producing counties to extensively solicit farmers' opinions on cotton purchasing work. Various localities also formulated purchasing methods that designated zones, times, and locations, established democratic grading organizations, increased the number of purchasing stations, and simplified purchasing procedures, greatly improving work speed and making it easier for cotton farmers to sell their cotton. The purchasing departments are continuing their efforts to purchase all commercial cotton. (Jing Chun, Chuan Di)

    (From our newspaper) Shijiazhuang -- Hebei Province, known as the cotton granary of the motherland, fulfilled its cotton purchase task ahead of schedule and exceeded its quota in 1957. As of December 15th, a total of 506.32 million jin of ginned cotton had been purchased, accounting for 101.3% of the state cotton purchase task. At present, Hebei Province is strengthening the later-stage unified purchase of cotton, striving to purchase an additional 20 to 30 million jin of ginned cotton for the state.

    The good cotton purchase situation in Hebei Province is due to the bumper cotton harvest last year, as well as the strengthened specific leadership of the local Party and government in the unified cotton purchase work. First, the unified cotton purchase policy was extensively and deeply implemented, closely integrated with the socialist debate in rural areas. Many agricultural cooperatives achieved a situation where no cotton was stored in any cooperative, and all teams sold all their cotton; at the same time, the policy of retaining cotton was also conscientiously implemented. Second, the principle of "quick purchase, sufficient purchase" was conscientiously implemented. According to actual needs, the number of purchasing personnel was increased, purchasing methods were improved, and agricultural cooperatives were timely guided and mobilized to pick and sell cotton. At the same time, the masses were deeply mobilized to carry out the "three searches" for cotton (searching for fallen cotton, eyelash cotton, and stiff-petal cotton), reducing cotton loss and ensuring that all cotton was returned to the public. Through the "three searches" for cotton, the Gengjiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Baixiang County transformed from a deficit-producing cooperative to an increased-production cooperative, with an average increase of more than eight jin per mu for the cooperative's 1,492 mu of cotton. Beixi Village in Gaocheng County used the money from selling "three searches" cotton to buy three Mongolian horses and distribute more than 800 yuan to the cooperative members. The Heping Village Agricultural Cooperative in Ningjin County also used the money from selling "three searches" cotton to buy four five-wheeled waterwheels, supporting water conservancy construction.

    Currently, Hebei Province is conducting an in-depth review of cotton: checking whether the "three searches" were thorough; checking the implementation of the self-retention cotton policy; checking whether all the ginned cotton processed from seed-retaining cotton has been sold; and checking whether the unified purchase task has been thoroughly completed.

    江西河北购棉任务超额完成
    本报讯　截至12月25日止，江西农民出售给国家的皮棉，已达三十八万零五十八担，超额完成国家分配的三十万担统购任务，比1956年实际收购量增长10.16％。江西省去年棉花空前丰年，总产量超过第一个五年计划原订指标的22％。棉花色泽洁白，成熟度好，含杂含水量很低，一般都很干净。广大棉农都做到先国家、后自己、多卖少留，留次棉、卖好棉，积极地尽快地把棉花卖给国家。进贤县许多棉农，每人只留一斤棉，有的因有存棉，把全部棉花卖给国家。
    棉花收购工作也比过去有很大改进。各棉产县分别召开了棉农代表会议，广泛征求棉农对棉花收购工作的意见，各地并制定了划片定时定点的收购办法，成立民主评级机构，增设收购站，简化收购手续，大大提高了工作速度，使棉农卖花方便。现在收购部门还在继续努力，争取把全部商品棉都收购上来。　（景春、传第）
    本报讯　号称祖国棉仓的河北省，1957年棉花收购任务提前超额完成，到12月15日为止共收购皮棉五亿零六百三十二万斤，占国家购棉任务的101.3％。目前河北省正在加强棉花后期统购工作，争取为国家再多收皮棉二、三千万斤。
    河北省棉花收购情况良好的原因，除了去年棉花丰收以外，主要是当地党政加强了棉花统购工作的具体领导。首先，密切结合了农村社会主义大辩论，广泛深入地贯彻了棉花统购政策。很多农业社做到了社社不存棉，队队卖干净；同时还认真贯彻了留棉政策。其次，认真贯彻了“快收、收足”的方针，根据实际需要，增加了收购人员，改进了采购方法，及时指导和动员农业社采摘和交售棉花；同时还深入发动群众开展了棉花“三找”（找落地棉、眼睫毛棉、僵瓣棉）工作，减少了棉花流失，做到了所有棉花全部还家。柏乡县耿家庄农业社通过棉花“三找”，由亏产社变成了增产社，全社一千四百九十二亩棉花，平均每亩增产八斤多；藁城县北席村用“三找”棉花卖的款，买了三匹蒙古马，还给社员分了八百多元；宁晋县和平村农业社也用卖“三找”棉花的钱，买了四架五轮水车，支持了水利建设。
    目前，河北省正在深入开展棉花的复查工作：查“三找”是否彻底；查自留棉政策执行情况；查种籽留棉是否把加工后的皮棉全部出售了；查统购任务是否彻底完成。
