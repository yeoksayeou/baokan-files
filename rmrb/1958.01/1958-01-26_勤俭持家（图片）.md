    Thrift and Frugality in Managing a Household
    Zhuang Ping, Zhang Heming
    Plan at the beginning of the month; don't waste oil.
    Don't waste a single grain of rice; save coal.
    Turn old clothes into new; conserve water.
    Turn off the lights when leaving the house; save to buy public bonds.

    勤俭持家
    庄平　张鹤鸣
    月初作计划　用油不浪费　不撒一粒饭　烧煤要节省
    旧衣改新衣　用水要节约  出门把灯关　节约买公债
