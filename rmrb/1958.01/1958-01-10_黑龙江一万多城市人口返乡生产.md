Over Ten Thousand Urban Residents in Heilongjiang Return to the Countryside for Production

(Our Report) Many unemployed people in towns and cities in Heilongjiang Province have been actively signing up to return to the countryside for production. As of December 24th, statistics from only Shuangcheng, Keshan, Zhaodong, Longjiang, Ning'an, Tieli, Harbin, Mudanjiang, Qiqihar, and other counties and cities show that more than 11,000 people have already returned.

Those returning to the countryside for production and requesting to participate in agricultural production include family members of workers, family members of cadres, farmers who blindly flowed into the cities, and unemployed residents in towns and cities without fixed occupations. More than a dozen citizens in Harbin submitted applications to the People's Reception Office of the Provincial People's Committee requesting to go to the countryside. Some middle and primary school graduates in Qiqihar expressed a desire to go to the countryside to participate in construction and settle down permanently. Wang Baolin and Lü Renfeng, residents of No. 38 Beixiaojie Minjie Street in the Aimin Subdistrict of Mudanjiang City, jointly wrote a letter to the mayor requesting to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production. Liu Qingbin, a resident of Jishan Street in the Qixing Subdistrict of Mudanjiang City, is a demobilized soldier who moved from the Qingmei Agricultural Cooperative in the Qingmei Township of the suburban area of the city last spring to the city to find work. In the past year, he only worked as a temporary worker for two or three months. This time, upon hearing the government's call to return to the countryside for production, he realized that he had taken the wrong path in the past and immediately returned to his hometown to find a house.

Urban residents who have gone to the countryside for production have been properly resettled. Farmers in Zhaodong County are finding ways to help the residents who have gone down, ensuring that families with fewer people live on one shared kang (a heated brick bed), and families with more people live in one and a half rooms. The Central Cooperative of Haishan Township not only lent each household corn and newly harvested grain but also gave each household a cart of corn stalks. The urban residents who went to the countryside are very satisfied and have happily participated in production, some of whom have already earned more than one hundred work points.

    黑龙江一万多城市人口返乡生产
    本报讯　黑龙江省许多城镇的赋闲人口纷纷报名回乡生产。到12月24日，仅据双城、克山、肇东、龙江、宁安、铁骊、哈尔滨、牡丹江、齐齐哈尔等部分县市的统计，已有一万一千多人。
    这些回乡生产和要求下乡参加农业生产的人，有职工家属、干部家属、盲目流入城市的农民和城镇中没有固定职业的赋闲居民。哈尔滨市有十多名市民到省人民委员会人民接待室提出下乡的申请。齐齐哈尔市有些中、小学毕业生要求到农村去参加建设，长期安家立业。牡丹江市爱民办事处北小街民街三十八号居民王宝琳和吕仁凤联名给市长写信，要求下乡参加农业生产。牡丹江市七星办事处积善街居民刘清斌，是复员军人，去年春天从市郊区青梅乡青梅农业社退社搬进城来找工作，一年来只作了二、三个月临时工。这次听到政府号召回乡生产，他觉悟到过去走错了路，马上回乡找了房子。
    下乡生产的城镇居民都已得到了妥善安置。肇东县农民为下去的居民想办法找住处，做到人口少的一家住一铺炕，人口多的住一间半房。海山乡中心社不仅借给每户苞米和新打的谷子，还送给每户一车苞米秸子。下乡的城镇居民非常满意，都愉快地参加了生产，有的已经挣了一百多分。
