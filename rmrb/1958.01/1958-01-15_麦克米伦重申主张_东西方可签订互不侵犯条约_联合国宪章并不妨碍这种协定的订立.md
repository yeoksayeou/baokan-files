Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, January 13th: British Prime Minister Macmillan reiterated his shopworn "peace through strength" cliché at a press conference held here on the 13th.

At the same time, Macmillan once again expressed his support for the East and West signing a non-aggression treaty. He said that although all members of the United Nations are prohibited from aggression under the United Nations Charter, he believes that there is nothing objectionable to reaffirming the obligations of the Charter with another solemn agreement. He said: "If it is helpful to issue a declaration solemnly announcing our intention not to aggress against each other, then we should have such a declaration. But it must be balanced by a technical agreement. We must have a definite, clear, negotiated and signed agreement."

He described the nuclear deterrent policy that the British government is striving to pursue as a policy of "seeking peace," and the purpose of the Western arms race as "making war less attractive." At the same time, he said that the enormous destructive power of nuclear weapons has now made war virtually impossible. "We must consider ways to maintain peace that are not as expensive, labor-intensive, and alarming as nuclear weapons."

He also described the aggressive Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization as "purely defensive" organizations, and expressed his support for plans to link the Baghdad Pact, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He said that "experimental plans" to establish links between these organizations are underway. The secretaries-general of the three organizations are meeting from time to time to discuss ways to establish links.

When asked about his views on a summit meeting, Macmillan said that "careful consideration and thorough preparation" must be carried out before holding such a meeting.

Macmillan disagreed with the claim that the Commonwealth could become a balancing force between the world's two major blocs. He emphasized that the Commonwealth's "neutrality" would imply placing the West and communism on an equal footing, and "this is impossible."

In answering questions, Macmillan also reiterated Britain's position of following the United States in obstructing the restoration of the People's Republic of China's seat in the United Nations.

    麦克米伦重申主张
    东西方可签订互不侵犯条约
    联合国宪章并不妨碍这种协定的订立
    据新华社卡拉奇13日电　英国首相麦克米伦13日在这里举行的记者招待会上重弹以实力求和平的滥调。
    同时，麦克米伦再一次表示他赞成东西方签订互不侵犯条约。他说，虽然联合国全体会员国根据联合国宪章不得进行侵略，但是他认为用另一个庄严的协定来重申宪章的义务是没有甚么可反对的。他说：“如果发表一个郑重地宣布我们互不侵犯的意图的宣言是有帮助的话，那么我们就应该有这样一个宣言。但是必须以技术性的协定来同它求得平衡。我们必须有一项确切的、清楚的、经过谈判而签订的协定。”
    他把英国政府竭力奉行的核威慑政策说成是“谋求和平”的政策，把西方进行军备竞赛的目的说成是为了“使得战争不那么具有吸引力”，同时他又说，现在，核武器具有的巨大的破坏力使得战争已经实际上不可能爆发，“我们必须考虑用不像核武器那样费钱、费力和惊人的方法来维持和平。”
    他还把侵略性的巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织说成是“纯防御性的”组织，并且表示赞成关于把巴格达条约、东南亚条约组织和北大西洋公约组织联系起来的计划。他说，建立这几个组织之间的联系的“试验性计划”正在进行中。这三个组织的秘书长们正在不时地会晤，讨论建立联系的办法。
    麦克米伦在回答他对最高级会议的看法时说，在举行这种会议之前必须进行“周密的考虑和充分的准备。”
    麦克米伦不同意英联邦可能成为世界两大集团之间的平衡力量的说法，他强调说，英联邦的“中立”将含有把西方和共产主义放在同等地位的意思，而“这是不可能的”。
    麦克米伦在回答问题时还重申了英国追随美国阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的席位的立场。
