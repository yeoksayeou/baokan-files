    Don't Spend Money Recklessly
    The Mingxing Agricultural Cooperative in Li Yuan Township, Dayuan District, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, is a cooperative mainly producing handmade paper. Last year, it had a bumper harvest in agricultural and sideline production, with the average net income of cooperative members reaching more than 500 yuan per household. In late November, the cooperative conducted a preliminary distribution according to the members' requests. After the distribution, many members went to the city (Hangzhou, Fuyang) to have fun, buy high-end goods, and snap up scarce materials. In the three or four days after the dividend distribution, more than 120 people in the cooperative (accounting for more than 50% of the cooperative's labor force) abandoned production and ran to Hangzhou, Fuyang and other places to buy things and have fun. According to investigations, a total of about 4,300 yuan was spent, averaging more than 35 yuan per person. For example, cooperative member Li Chengche only received 34 yuan, but went to Hangzhou to buy sweet potato starch, clothes, socks, towels, sneakers, lychees and other materials, spending 47 yuan. Cooperative member Ding Zhengwen bought a bolt of ramie cloth, a woolen blanket, a cedar plank box, and 15 jin of sweet potato starch, spending a total of 43 yuan. Young people in the cooperative's third natural village bought back thirteen watches. These extravagant and wasteful phenomena have brought many adverse consequences to production. For example, in December, 32 of the 35 distilleries in the cooperative were shut down for an average of three to six days due to the main labor force going to the city, resulting in a loss of more than 200 pieces of handmade paper, worth 3,000 yuan. Although most of the production has been restored, because the members still have money in their hands, they crave simple labor, resulting in the phenomenon of "late start and early stop" in work. According to investigations, the paper production rate has decreased by 20%-30% compared to the normal situation in the past. The cooperative's 20,000 dan of accumulated fertilizer task has only been half completed.
    Currently, this tendency has attracted the attention of the local Party committee, which has strengthened ideological education and changed the distribution methods. However, this phenomenon and thinking after a bumper harvest are widespread, and it is hoped that all agricultural cooperatives will strengthen ideological education for their members.

    有钱不要乱花
    浙江富阳县大沅区礼沅乡明星农业社是一个生产土纸为主的社，去年农副业生产获得了大丰收，社员净收入平均每户达五百多元。在11月下旬，该社根据社员要求，进行了一次预分。分配后，不少社员就进城（杭州、富阳）玩，买高档商品，抢购些紧张物资。在分红后的三、四天中，全社就有一百二十多人（占全社劳动力50％以上）放弃生产跑杭州、富阳等地买东西，游玩。据调查，共用去四千三百元左右，平均每人用去三十五元多。如社员李承车只分了三十四元，到杭州买山粉、衣服、袜子、毛巾、球鞋、荔枝等物资，用去四十七元。社员丁正文购得夏布一匹，呢毯一条，杉板箱一只，山粉十五斤共花去四十三元。该社第三自然村的青年买回手表十三只。这些铺张浪费现象给生产带来了许多不良后果，如该社在12月份，三十五个糟厂中有三十二个因主要劳动力进城，平均停工三至六天，少产土纸二百余件，价值三千元。目前虽已大部分恢复生产，但因社员手中仍然有钱，贪求简单的劳动，产生“出工迟，停工早”的现象。据调查，产纸率较过去正常情况降低了20％—30％。该社二万担积肥任务也只完成了一半。
    目前，这个倾向已引起当地党委重视，分别加强了思想教育工作和改变了分配的办法。但是，丰收后这种现象和思想是普遍存在的，希望各农业社应加强对社员的思想教育。
