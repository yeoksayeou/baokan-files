        The Wonderful Use of the "State of the Union Address"

        The American economy is in recession, a fact that even the U.S. President had to admit in his State of the Union address.

        How to salvage the crisis? The American monopoly capital group said: "Increase military spending." The U.S. President complied. Eisenhower boasted that during his tenure, the United States had already spent more than 200 billion U.S. dollars on armaments. Then he guaranteed that more money would be spent on military affairs in the future.

        There is a lot of profit to be made, so the moment the "State of the Union Address" was published, the New York stock prices, which were in a slump, immediately soared. In this regard, Eisenhower's "State of the Union Address" has already done a great favor for American monopoly capitalists, but from now on, the American people will have to endure even greater "sacrifices."

    “国情咨文”的妙用
    美国经济在衰退，这是美国总统在他的国情咨文里也不得不承认的。
    怎样挽救危机呢？美国垄断资本集团说：“增加军事开支”。美国总统照办不误。艾森豪威尔报功说，在他任内美国已经在军备方面花费了二千多亿美元。接着他又保证今后还要在军事方面花更多的钱。
    油水是不少的，所以“国情咨文”刚刚发表，正在疲跌中的纽约股票价格马上猛涨。照此说来，艾森豪威尔的“国情咨文”已经为美国垄断资本家做了一件大好事，但是从此美国人民却要忍受更大的“牺牲”。
