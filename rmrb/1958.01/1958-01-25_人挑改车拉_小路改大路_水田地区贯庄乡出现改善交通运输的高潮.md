Replacing Human Labor with Carts, Small Roads Converted to Large Roads
A High Tide of Transportation Improvement Appears in Guanzhuang Township, a Paddy Field Area

(Reported by this newspaper) Hubei Daily News: Small roads are being converted into large roads, and human labor is being replaced with carts. A high tide of transportation improvement has emerged in Guanzhuang Township, Suixian County, Hubei Province. In this paddy field area, where everything had to be carried by people since the "beginning of time," men and women are now pulling flatbed carts and harnessing oxen to haul pond mud from the embankments to the fields. Historically, the large roads here were just field ridges, but with the need for transportation, some are being converted into "small roads" seven or eight feet wide.

Last December, Huang Xianwang (a carpenter), a member of the Yongyong Tenth Cooperative in this township, made a cart at the water conservancy construction site to haul earth, which could do the work of ten people carrying loads. Li Yuhua, the director of the Eighth Cooperative, took a liking to this cart. He thought: with all the labor force on the construction site, the cooperative has pond mud but lacks people to carry it; it would be great to use this cart to haul it! He discussed it with the cooperative members, and everyone said it was a great idea. Some cooperative members went to repair the roads, and others went to pull the carts. After trying it out, one cart and one ox could haul the pond mud for eight mu of land in a day, which is equivalent to eleven male full laborers. Ye Dingfu, who is over sixty years old, said: "Working in the paddy fields all day long is tiring, but with this, we old folks can also do the work in the fields." The next day, cadres from all ten cooperatives in the township went to visit and observe. Li Jiabao, the director of the Fifth Cooperative, said: "It would be great to use this to transport grain! One cart can do the work of more than ten people carrying loads!"

As soon as the replacement of human labor with carts was promoted, each team and cooperative scrambled to buy carts. The township party branch organized all thirty-one carpenters in the township, led by Huang Xianwang, who made the first cart, to form a "cart factory." Now, one flatbed cart, ox cart, and wheelbarrow after another is rolling out of the "factory." Roads, one "small highway" after another, are also being widened. Nearly half of the fields in the Eighth Cooperative can now be accessed by carts. Other cooperatives each have one to three "small highways."

The township has already made a plan to achieve the following before the Spring Festival: roads reaching every bay in the fields, connecting every team to the cooperative, and every cooperative to the township; each cooperative to have ten carts. Before the start of the spring plowing and great production, 80% of the transportation in the cooperatives will be changed from human labor to carts.

### 人挑改车拉　小路改大路  水田地区贯庄乡出现改善交通运输的高潮

    人挑改车拉　小路改大路
    水田地区贯庄乡出现改善交通运输的高潮
    本报讯　湖北日报消息：小路改大路，人挑改车拉，一个改善交通运输的高潮，已在湖北省随县贯庄乡出现。在这个“开天辟地”以来什么都得要人挑的水田地区，目前，在冲里、畈里，男的女的正拉着板车套上耕牛从埝里往田里拉塘泥。这里历史上的大路——田埂，随着运输的需要，有些正在改成七、八尺宽的“小公路”。
    去年12月，这个乡的永勇十社社员黄先旺（木匠）在水利工地上做了一辆车，用来拉土，能顶十一个人挑。八社主任李玉华看中了这种车。他想：劳动力都上了工地，社里有塘泥就是缺人挑，用这个车拉该多好！他和社员商量，大家都说好得很。有的社员就去修路，有的去拉车，试了一下，一车一牛一天能拉八亩塘泥，能顶十一个男整劳力。六十多岁的叶定富说：“水田活路一天挑到晚，有了这，田里的活路我们老头也都能干”。第二天全乡十个社的干部都去参观。五社主任李家保说：“用这送粮该多好啊！一车能顶十几人挑！”
    人挑改车拉刚一推广，各队各社都争着要买车。乡党支部把全乡三十一个木匠组织在一起，由造第一辆车的黄先旺领导，组织了个“造车厂”。现在一辆又一辆的板车、牛车、独轮车正在出“厂”。各社一条条的“小公路”也正在加修。八社近一半的田已能通车。其他各社都已有一到三条“小公路”。
    这个乡已经作出规划，春节前作到：公路片田通湾，队队通社，社社通乡；每社达到十辆车。春耕大生产开始前，社里80％的运输由人挑改成车拉。
