Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 10th -- Cadres of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have opened up ten mu of experimental land using vacant land in the organs, striving to apply 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu and produce 1,000 jin of grain, setting a high-yield example for farmers of all ethnic groups. At present, these experimental fields have been ploughed and watered for the winter, and the cadres have begun to use their spare time to collect manure and accumulate fertilizer.

In order to cultivate the experimental fields well, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organs organized a production management committee. Liu Zexi, the Minister of the Rural Work Department, was elected as the director by everyone. A technical research group composed mainly of agricultural technicians was also established, and elderly farmers from nearby agricultural cooperatives were hired as consultants. All the cadres of the Provincial Committee were organized into ten production teams, and they used their spare time to engage in labor production. First Secretary Gao Feng, Secretaries Zhu Xiafu, Chen Sigong, Zhang Guosheng, Zaxi Wangxu (Tibetan) and others all participated in the production teams.

    给各族农民作出高产榜样
    青海省委会干部开辟试验田
    新华社西宁10日电　中共青海省委的干部利用机关里的空地开辟了十亩试验地，争取每亩施肥万斤，产粮千斤，给各族农民作出高产榜样。目前，这些试验地已经翻过和浇了冬水，干部们开始利用休息时间拾粪积肥。
    为了种好试验地，中共青海省委机关组织了生产管理委员会，农村工作部部长刘泽西被大家推选为主任，还成立了以农业技术干部为主的技术研究小组，聘请了附近农业社的老年农民当顾问。省委全体干部编成十个生产队，利用工余时间劳动生产。第一书记高峰、书记朱侠夫、陈思恭、张国声、扎喜旺徐（藏）等都参加了生产队。
