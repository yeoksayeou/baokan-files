    The United States Continues to Obstruct Negotiations, Intensifies "Cold War"
    Gu Si
    Delaying and Obstructing Negotiations
    The American ruling clique originally wanted to completely shut the door to East-West negotiations, dismissing Soviet peace initiatives. Dulles's article in "Life Magazine" proved this. However, this die-hard approach met resistance at the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Group. The Soviet proposal immediately triggered enthusiastic responses from world public opinion. Bulganin's second letter further promoted the movement demanding negotiations and promoting peaceful coexistence, deepening the divisions and contradictions within the American military bloc. Therefore, the United States had to resort to empty talk of peace to block the huge wave of demands for negotiations at home and abroad.
    Eisenhower's reply to Bulganin's letter and his State of the Union Address showed that the United States was responding to negotiations with an expanded arms race. At the same time, Dulles delivered a speech and two interviews, spreading an atmosphere of doubt about high-level talks and slandering the Soviet Union's sincerity in seeking to break the "Cold War" stalemate, which further exposed the United States' lack of sincerity towards negotiations.
    Eisenhower's letter to Bulganin, under the pressure of the universal desire for negotiations around the world, did not dare to close the door to negotiations. He also talked a lot about so-called "peace work" in his State of the Union Address. But the actual intention of the American ruling clique to oppose peace and obstruct negotiations cannot be concealed in the slightest. It not only clumsily used the existing provisions of the United Nations Charter as an excuse to block a series of practical and feasible proposals put forward by the Soviet Union to solve current pressing problems, but also put forward a series of "preconditions" for negotiations: on the one hand, it unreasonably asked the Soviet Union to abandon its veto power in the Security Council to "strengthen the United Nations," and to discuss absurd "counter-proposals" such as the so-called "situation in Eastern Europe" to undermine the basis of negotiations; on the other hand, it demanded that before holding high-level talks, diplomatic contacts or foreign ministers' meetings must be held to carry out so-called "sincere preparatory work." Dulles even openly stated that the United States was only willing to carry out such "preparation," that is, to reopen disarmament negotiations and entangle the Soviet Union in the West's unchangeable plan to obstruct disarmament, making high-level talks a distant prospect. Dulles himself admitted that a "decisive turning point" had now taken place in the balance of international forces, and the United States could no longer be like a bull that "lowers its head and blindly rushes towards the toreador's red cape," but must "avoid" the "sharp edge" and look for loopholes. Now, the United States' approach to negotiations is to avoid the sharp edge of world people's demand for high-level talks.
    The United States' attempt to obstruct negotiations with unreasonable conditions while trying to shift the responsibility for delaying negotiations to the Soviet Union is doomed to bankruptcy. Even former British Prime Minister Attlee believed that "at present, almost every time someone proposes a solution to international problems, the (American) State Department always issues somewhat rash remarks to obstruct it." The truth is exactly like this.
    Expanding the Arms Race
    While obstructing negotiations, the United States is intensifying its unprecedented arms expansion and war preparations. The total military expenditure of the United States in the new year has accounted for 81% of the total budget, setting a record high for peacetime in American history. It has increased spending on missile development to $5.3 billion, and spending on arming allies and establishing missile bases under the guise of "common security" to more than $3.9 billion. Therefore, the American President's State of the Union Address asked the people to tighten their belts and make more "sacrifices," asked America's allies to "strengthen cooperation," and emphasized the importance of the principled agreement reached at the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Group on storing nuclear weapons and establishing missile bases in Western Europe.
    Now, while the United States is anxious to develop missiles, it is also stepping up its plans to establish missile bases in Western Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East. It is not that the United States has not seen that with the loss of military "superiority," its "leadership" has been shaken, its allies are taking the opportunity to fight for greater say, the struggle between West Germany and Britain for the leadership of Western Europe is becoming increasingly fierce, and the movement of West European people against nuclear war preparations is rising, all of which are causing a serious crisis in the arms expansion and war preparation policy pursued by the United States. But the United States is trying to save the decline. It is trying to use Britain's eagerness to maintain its status as the "third atomic power," West Germany and France's attempts to catch up in nuclear weapons, and France's asking for money and Western Europe's economic difficulties to force Western European countries to accept plans for storing nuclear weapons, establishing rocket bases, and "cooperating" on scientific and technological resources. The United States also plans to set up missile bases in some member states of the Baghdad Pact and the Far East.
    In addition, the United States is also stepping up activities to strengthen military blocs and link various military blocs together. After the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Group, the United States immediately decided to send a "delegation" headed by Dulles to attend the Baghdad Pact Council, and conducted frequent diplomatic contacts with more than 40 member states participating in military blocs, planning to "combine" the North Atlantic Treaty, the Baghdad Pact, the Manila Treaty, and the Organization of American States. The United States believes that this can stabilize various military blocs, make up for the serious weaknesses in the United States' military deployment, deepen the division and opposition in the world, and strengthen the so-called "overall Cold War."
    Not only that, but the United States, regardless of the strong protests of the people of all countries, continues to order American planes carrying hydrogen bombs to fly day and night over the skies of the countries where the bases are located. The scope of this provocative flight has been extended to the Middle East. At the same time, the U.S. military recently held a so-called atomic "strike" exercise near the Korean military demarcation line, the largest since the armistice, and held a six-day military exercise on land and in the Pacific waters from northern Japan to southern Philippines, to intimidate the people of all countries, poison the international atmosphere, and prevent further easing of the tense situation.
    New Conspiracies in the Middle East
    Dulles's personal attendance at the Baghdad Pact Council in Ankara on January 27 exposed the United States' conspiracy to expand the "Cold War" and carry out new aggression in the Middle East.
    As revealed by Egyptian, Syrian and other Arab political activists and newspapers, Dulles's trip to the Middle East proved that the United States is still pursuing the repeatedly thwarted "Eisenhower Doctrine," attempting to strengthen and expand the Baghdad Group to divide Arab countries, establish missile bases in the Middle East, and offset the influence of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference.
    The Soviet government's statement on the situation in the Near and Middle East, authorized by TASS, criticized the United States' conspiracy to force member states of the Baghdad Pact to participate in atomic war preparations, and proposed the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone of peace in the Middle East. This statement infuriated Washington, which denied the United States' plan to establish rocket bases in the Middle East. However, Washington's anger and denial precisely proved that the TASS statement hit its sore spot. Dulles's statement after meeting with Eisenhower before his trip also openly stated that the United States would "unswervingly support the principle of collective security embodied in the Baghdad Pact." The "collective security" referred to here is no different from what the United States emphasized when it proposed at the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Group the plan to store nuclear weapons and establish rocket bases in Central Europe. Before attending the Baghdad Pact Military Committee, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Taylor held secret negotiations in Iraq and other countries on the establishment of rocket bases, which was to carry out this part of Dulles's mission. In fact, Turkey has agreed to the United States establishing rocket bases on its territory. American military bases have also been established in Jordan, Iraq and Iran. The US State Department wants to deliberately evade these facts, indicating that it is guilty.
    The American President's State of the Union Address, and the Gaither Committee Report and the Rockefeller Report on which this address is based, have exposed the ambition of the American oil monopoly capital group to carry out military and economic aggression in the Middle East simultaneously. The "Wall Street Journal," in commenting on the Rockefeller Report, believed that the "bold military policy" advocated by this group was to learn from the failure of the Syrian incident last year and strengthen the "Eisenhower Doctrine," "leading the United States to launch wars against small countries." Therefore, the "New York Times" was particularly interested in Dulles's attendance at the Baghdad Pact Council, clamoring that whether from the perspective of the "Cold War" or "power politics," the Baghdad Pact should become "one of the forces that the United States should try to manipulate or at least strengthen."
    Many Difficulties
    The United States' obstruction of negotiations, its intensified arms expansion and war preparations, and its activities to create tension in Western Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East indicate that after the emergence of a new turning point in international relations, stopping the "Cold War" and promoting peaceful coexistence will still be a sharp and complex struggle. However, it is clear that the situation is moving in a direction that is conducive to peace, and the difficulties faced by American diplomacy are constantly increasing.
    Within the United States, an increasing number of people are demanding that reality be faced and peaceful coexistence be accepted. Dulles's rigid diplomacy has been subjected to stronger criticism, and Eisenhower's reply to Bulganin's letter has also aroused widespread criticism from public opinion. American bourgeois commentator Lippmann believes that in the current situation where the balance of power between East and West has changed, the United States "should learn to coexist peacefully with Russia." Such calls can even be heard among some big entrepreneurs and important political figures.
    More importantly, it can be seen from the replies of Western countries to Bulganin's proposal that the movement of people of all countries against the "Cold War" and demanding negotiations is continuing to expand, and the contradictions and differences between imperialists are deepening. Denmark, Norway, Canada and other countries expressed support for the proposal to hold a high-level meeting. The French and West German governments, succumbing to American pressure and negating the Soviet Union's peace initiatives, are causing great dissatisfaction in parliament and public opinion. The newly reconvened British House of Commons also continued to express a strong desire for negotiations. Many members of parliament questioned the government for its lack of initiative and failure to take steps on its own to ensure that high-level meetings could be convened as early as possible. British Deputy Prime Minister Butler also admitted that "most of the British public opinion" advocates holding this meeting, and said that the upcoming reply to Bulganin's second letter "will not disappoint the House of Commons." The growing force of public opinion is increasingly isolating the United States and its followers.
    The current situation has been made very clear. All countries that are prepared to accept the US establishment of rocket bases must consider the urgent issue of peaceful coexistence versus the catastrophic danger of nuclear war. It is entirely understandable that Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe and the Soviet Union's recent proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East are particularly attractive.
    The Asian and African peoples, who have repeatedly frustrated the US war provocations, will more forcefully counter the new "Cold War" conspiracy of the United States. The unity of Arab countries is strengthening and expanding. Recent talks between the leaders of Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Yemen have all demonstrated this. It is significant that Saudi Arabian Prime Minister Faisal repeatedly expressed his rejection of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," opposition to the Baghdad Pact, and support for national liberation and Arab unity during his visit to Egypt. Within the Baghdad Pact group, there are also many serious differences. Member states such as Iran, Pakistan, and Iraq also have varying degrees of reservations about supporting certain aggressive activities of the United States. This situation was more obvious in the US threat to Syria.
    It is worth noting that right under the feet of the United States, Latin America is constantly seeing political developments that make the United States uneasy. The Mexican and Dominican governments, as well as the public opinion of other Latin American countries, have expressed opposition to the establishment of ties between the Organization of American States and the North Atlantic Treaty. The struggle for peace and national independence has recently made great progress in this region.
    The American ruling clique is currently in a difficult situation, both internally and externally. If it insists on resisting the strong pressure from the whole world for easing the tense situation through East-West talks and adhering to the "Cold War" policy, it will only make it more isolated and suffer greater failures.

### 美国继续阻挠谈判，加紧“冷战”
顾思

    美国继续阻挠谈判，加紧“冷战”
    顾思
    拖延和阻挠谈判
    美国统治集团原来是想完全关死东西方谈判的大门，不把苏联的和平倡议当作一回事，杜勒斯在“生活杂志”发表的文章证明了这一点。但是，这个死硬做法，在北大西洋集团巴黎会议上碰了壁。苏联建议一开始就引起世界舆论的热烈响应。布尔加宁的第二封信更进一步推动了要求谈判、促进和平共处的运动，加深了美国军事集团内部的分歧和矛盾。于是，美国不得不采取空谈和平的办法，来阻挡国内外要求谈判的巨大声浪。
    艾森豪威尔答复布尔加宁的信和他所发表的国情咨文，表明了美国是要用扩大军备竞赛来答复谈判。在这同时，杜勒斯接连地发表了一次演说、两次谈话，大肆散布对高级会谈的怀疑气氛，诬蔑苏联谋求打破“冷战”僵局的诚意，这就更暴露了美国对待谈判是毫无诚意的。
    艾森豪威尔给布尔加宁的复信，迫于全世界要求谈判的普遍愿望，不敢关闭谈判的大门。他在国情咨文中也大谈所谓“和平工作”。但美国统治集团敌视和平、阻挠谈判的实际意图，是丝毫掩盖不了的。它不仅拙劣地用联合国宪章已有规定为借口，硬把苏联提出的一系列解决当前迫切问题的切实可行的建议挡了回去，而且提出了一系列谈判的“先决条件”：一方面横蛮无理地要苏联放弃安理会否决权来“加强联合国”，要讨论所谓“东欧局势”问题之类的荒谬的“反建议”，以破坏谈判的基础；另一方面，要求在举行高级会谈以前必须先进行外交接触或者举行外长会议来进行所谓“具有诚意的准备工作”。杜勒斯更公然表示，美国只愿进行这样的“准备”，即重开裁军谈判，要苏联同西方国家不可改变的阻挠裁军的方案继续纠缠下去，使高级会谈变成遥遥无期的事。杜勒斯自己也承认，现在国际力量对比已发生了“决定性的转折点”，美国不能再像一头蛮牛那样“低下头去盲目冲向斗牛士的红斗篷”，而要“避开”“锋芒”，钻空子。现在美国对待谈判的手法正是避开世界人民要求举行高级会谈的锋芒。
    美国要想用无理条件来阻挠谈判，而又想把拖延谈判的责任推在苏联身上的企图，是注定要破产的。连英国前首相艾德礼也认为，“目前，几乎每当有人提出解决国际问题的办法时，（美国）国务院总是发表有点轻率的言论加以阻挠”。事实真相正是这样。
    扩大军备竞赛
    美国在阻挠谈判的同时，加紧进行空前规模的扩军备战活动，美国新年度的全部军事性开支已占到总预算的81％，创美国历史上和平时期的最高纪录。它把用于发展导弹方面的开支增加到五十三亿美元，在“共同安全”名目下用于武装盟国和建立导弹基地的费用增加到三十九亿多美元。因此，美国总统国情咨文要求人民勒紧腰带作出更多的“牺牲”，要求美国的盟国“加强合作”，强调北大西洋集团巴黎会议对在西欧储存核武器和设立导弹基地作出的原则协议的重要性。
    现在，美国一面急于发展导弹，一面加紧策划在西欧、中东、远东地区建立导弹基地。美国并不是没有看到，随着军事“优势”的丧失，它的“领导地位”发生了动摇，它的盟国正乘机争取更大的发言权，西德同英国争夺西欧领导权的斗争趋于白热化，西欧人民反对核战争准备的运动更为高涨，这都使得美国所推行的扩军备战政策发生严重危机。但美国力图挽救颓势，它竭力利用英国急于要保持“第三原子强国”地位，西德和法国也企图在核武器方面迎头赶上，以及法国伸手要钱和西欧经济困难等等因素，来迫使西欧国家接受储存核武器、设立火箭基地和科学技术资源“合作”的计划。美国还打算在巴格达条约一些成员国和远东地区设置导弹基地。
    此外，美国还加紧进行加强军事集团和把各种军事集团联结起来的活动。在举行了北大西洋集团巴黎会议后，美国立即决定派遣以杜勒斯为首的“观察团”参加巴格达条约理事会，并同四十多个参加军事集团的成员国进行频繁的外交接触，策划把北大西洋公约、巴格达条约、马尼拉条约和美洲国家组织“结合起来”。美国认为这样既可以稳定各个军事集团，弥补美国在军事部署上的严重弱点，又可以加深世界的分裂和对立，加强所谓“总体冷战”。
    不仅如此，美国还不顾各国人民的强烈抗议，继续命令携带氢弹的美国飞机在基地所在国的上空日夜飞行。这个挑衅性的飞行范围，已经扩大到了中东。同时，最近美军在朝鲜军事分界线附近举行了一场停战以来规模最大的所谓原子“出击”演习，并在从日本北部到菲律宾南部的陆地上和太平洋海面上，举行了为时六天的军事演习，以恫吓各国人民，毒化国际气氛，阻止紧张局势的进一步缓和。
    在中东的新阴谋
    杜勒斯亲自出席1月27日在安卡拉举行的巴格达条约理事会，暴露了美国在中东扩大“冷战”和进行新的侵略的阴谋。
    正如埃及、叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家政治活动家和报纸所揭露的，杜勒斯的中东之行证明美国仍旧在奉行一再碰壁的“艾森豪威尔主义”，企图加强和扩大巴格达集团来分化阿拉伯国家，在中东建立导弹基地，抵消亚非人民团结大会的影响。
    塔斯社受权发表的苏联政府关于中近东局势的声明，抨击了美国企图迫使巴格达条约成员国参加原子战争准备的阴谋，并提出在中东建立无核武器的和平地区的建议。这个声明，使华盛顿暴跳如雷，抵赖美国在中东建立火箭基地的计划。但是，华盛顿的恼怒和抵赖，恰恰证明塔斯社声明打中了它的痛处。杜勒斯行前和艾森豪威尔会谈后发表的声明，也就公开表示美国要“始终不渝地支持巴格达条约所体现的集体安全的原则”。这里所指的“集体安全”，同美国在北大西洋集团巴黎会议上提出在中欧储存核武器和建立火箭基地的计划时所强调的没有两样。美国陆军参谋长泰勒在参加巴格达条约军事委员会前，到伊拉克等国举行有关建立火箭基地的秘密谈判，就是在执行杜勒斯的这一部分任务。事实上，土耳其已经同意美国在它的国土上建立火箭基地。约旦、伊拉克和伊朗境内也都建立了美国的军事基地。美国国务院想故意回避这些事实，说明它是心虚的。
    美国总统的国情咨文，和这个咨文所根据的盖瑟委员会报告和洛克菲勒报告，都已暴露了美国石油垄断资本集团实行军事经济双管齐下侵略中东的野心。“华尔街日报”在评论洛克菲勒报告时，认为这个集团所鼓吹的“大胆的军事政策”，是要吸取去年叙利亚事件的失败教训，加强“艾森豪威尔主义”，“导致美国对小国发动战争”。因此，“纽约时报”对杜勒斯出席巴格达条约理事会感到特别有兴趣，叫嚷无论从“冷战”和“强权政治”来看，巴格达条约都应该成为“美国要设法操纵或者至少要加强的力量之一”。
    困难重重
    美国阻挠谈判，加紧扩军备战，在西欧、中东和远东地区制造紧张局势的活动表明，国际关系上新的转折点出现后，制止“冷战”，促进和平共处，仍将是一场尖锐的复杂的斗争。不过，很显然，形势是朝着有利于和平的方向前进的，美国外交遭到的困难是不断增加的。
    在美国国内，要求正视现实、接受和平共处的人，正日益增多。杜勒斯的僵硬外交受到了更强烈的责难，艾森豪威尔给布尔加宁的复信也引起舆论的广泛批评。美国资产阶级评论家李普曼认为，在东西方力量对比已发生变化的现势下，美国“应当学会同俄国和睦共处”。这种呼声，甚至在某些大企业家和重要政界人士中，也可以听到。
    更重要的是，从西方国家答复布尔加宁建议的信中可以看出，各国人民反对“冷战”、要求谈判的运动正在继续扩大，帝国主义之间的矛盾和分歧正在加深。丹麦、挪威、加拿大和其他国家表示支持召开高级会议的建议。而法国和西德政府屈从美国的压力，否定苏联的和平倡议，正在议会和舆论界引起了极大的不满。英国新近复会的下院也继续表现了要求谈判的强烈情绪，许多议员纷纷质问政府为什么缺乏主动精神，不自行采取步骤，使得高级会议得以及早召开。英代理首相巴特勒也承认英国“大部分舆论”都主张举行这个会议，并表示即将答复布尔加宁的第二封复信“不致使下院失望”。越来越大的舆论力量，使得美国和它的追随者日益陷于孤立。
    目前形势已经摆得非常清楚，所有准备接受美国建立火箭基地的国家，都不能不对和平共处还是冒核战争的毁灭性危险这个迫切问题加以考虑。波兰提出的在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议，和苏联新近提出的在中东建立无原子武器区的建议，特别吸引人心，是完全可以理解的。
    一再挫败了美国的战争挑衅的亚非人民，更将有力地迎击美国的新的“冷战”阴谋。阿拉伯国家的团结正在加强和扩大。最近埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和也门领导人的会谈，都证明了这一点。沙特阿拉伯首相费萨尔在访问埃及时，一再表示拒绝接受“艾森豪威尔主义”，反对巴格达条约，支持民族解放和阿拉伯团结，这是具有意义的。巴格达条约集团内部，也出现了许多严重的分歧。伊朗、巴基斯坦、伊拉克等成员国，对于支持美国的某些侵略活动，也是有不同程度的保留的。这种情况在美国威胁叙利亚的事件上更为明显。
    值得注意的是，就在美国的脚下，拉丁美洲也不断出现使美国感到不安的政治动向。墨西哥和多米尼加政府以及其他拉丁美洲国家的舆论，都表示反对美洲国家组织同北大西洋公约建立联系。争取和平和民族独立的斗争，在这一地区最近有了很大的进展。
    美国统治集团目前正处于内外交迫，困难重重的局势下。它如果硬要不顾现实地抗拒全世界要求通过东西方会谈来缓和紧张局势的强大压力，坚持“冷战”政策，那末，只会使它更加孤立，遭到更大的失败。
