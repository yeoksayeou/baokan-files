Beijing middle and primary schools have shown many new signs of diligence in running schools thriftily and building schools through labor during the rectification campaign.

The Thirty-seventh Middle School, during the rectification campaign, decided on the approach of "picking up sesame seeds first, then carrying watermelons," and first, based on the school's consistently poor hygiene, mobilized the masses to spruce up the school grounds, cleaning the teachers' and students' kitchens, dining halls, toilets, and large and small warehouses. Under the leadership of seven groups composed of 101 faculty and staff members, the vast majority of the masses in the school actively and happily devoted themselves to labor. The physics and chemistry group of eight people cleaned seven teachers' and students' toilets in one hour. Teacher Yan Sizhuang carefully scrubbed the urinals in the toilets with lye water, and thoroughly scrubbed the wooden walls of the women teachers' toilet, which had not been scrubbed for many years. The faculty and staff members working in the student dining hall not only swept the ceiling and shoveled the floor, but also scrubbed the oil stains that had accumulated in the cracks of the tables for a long time.

After many primary schools in Changping District entered the rectification campaign, teachers' morale was high, and they actively took action to improve their work. Many teachers made their own teaching aids and actively participated in physical labor. Teachers at Tundian Primary School made new character cards, character-forming cards, and radical-forming character cards. Teacher Zheng Jing made counters within hundreds of digits. Teachers Liu Yuzhen and Chuan Lanzhi led the students in rolling more than 1,000 catties of coal balls and splitting more than 400 catties of firewood. Wang Huirong, the fourth-grade homeroom teacher of Yongfengtun Central Primary School, made four badminton rackets with scrap wood and guided the students to make more than 50 small cloth softballs and more than 40 shuttlecocks. Yang Shumin, the first-grade homeroom teacher, mobilized the students to make more than 20 small sandbags and made four small ball nets by herself.

During the rectification campaign, the primary schools in Fengtai District gave full play to the existing manpower and material resources. A high tide of "building schools through labor" was set off among all teachers, students, and staff members to improve working and learning conditions by themselves. According to statistics from 38 schools, teachers, students, and staff members split a total of 29,000 catties of firewood, leveled and padded 16 playgrounds, rolled 29 and a half tons of coal balls, and transported 149 tons of coal. Thirty-three schools repaired and installed stoves by themselves. Fourteen schools repaired their own walls. Twelve schools built their own houses and boiler rooms. The above-mentioned primary schools saved the state a total of 2,149 yuan.

    修整校容　制作教具
    北京中小学师生齐劳动
    本报讯　北京中、小学在整改中出现了许多勤俭办校、劳动建校的新气象。
    三十七中在整改中确定“先拣芝麻、后抱西瓜”的作法，首先根据学校卫生一贯较差的情况，发动群众动手修整校容，清扫教师和学生厨房、饭厅、厕所、大小仓库。在一百零一位教职员组成的七个组带动下，全校绝大多数的群众也积极愉快地投入了劳动。理化组八个人一小时之内就清扫了师生男女厕所七个。教师严思庄认真地用碱水刷洗了厕所的尿池，并把多年未刷过的女教师厕所的木墙也彻底刷洗了。在学生饭厅里劳动的教职员，不仅扫了棚、铲了地、而且把积了很久的桌缝里的油泥也刷净了。
    昌平区许多小学转入整改以后，教师情绪高涨，积极行动起来改进工作。很多教师自己动手制作教具，积极参加体力劳动。屯佃小学教师制作了生字卡片、组字卡片、偏旁组字片。教师郑景制作了百位数以内的计数器。刘玉珍和传兰芝二位教师带领学生摇了一千多斤煤球，劈了四百多斤劈柴。永丰屯中心小学四年级班主任王惠荣用废木板做了四付羽球拍，并指导学生做了五十多个布的小垒球，四十多只毽子。一年级班主任杨淑敏，发动学生做了二十多个小沙袋，自己动手织成四个小球网。
    丰台区小学在整改中，充分发挥了现有人力、物力。在全体师生员工中，掀起了亲自动手，改善工作和学习条件的“劳动建校”高潮。据三十八个学校统计，师生员工共劈劈柴二万九千斤，平垫十六个操场，摇煤球二十九吨半，运煤一百四十九吨。三十三个学校自己动手修理和安装了火炉。十四个学校自己修理了围墙。十二个学校自己修建了房屋和锅炉房。上述小学共给国家节约资金二千一百四十九元。
