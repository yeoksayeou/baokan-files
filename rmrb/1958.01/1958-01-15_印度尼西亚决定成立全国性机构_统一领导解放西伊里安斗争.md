Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 13th. Indonesian Army Chief of Staff spokesman Hasono announced on the 11th that, based on a recent decision by the government, Army Chief of Staff Nasution has decided that from now on, all work related to the struggle to liberate West Irian will be carried out through a unified organization called the National Front for the Liberation of West Irian. Hasono pointed out that this measure was taken to ensure unified leadership of the struggle.

Hasono said that the national and local organizations of the National Front for the Liberation of West Irian will operate under the direction of the holders of military power at the national and local levels, respectively, in accordance with the principles formulated by the National Security Council.

Previously, Indonesian Prime Minister Juanda announced on December 21, 1957, that the struggle to liberate West Irian would be led by the National Security Council. The National Security Council is composed of three deputy prime ministers, several cabinet ministers, and the chiefs of staff of the three armed services.

Nasution recently held a meeting with the Indonesian military, youth, labor, and peasant fronts, at which the work plan for the National Front for the Liberation of West Irian was determined. The military, youth, labor, and peasant fronts are a joint organization formed in November 1957 by Indonesian military and youth cooperative organizations and some labor and peasant organizations to strengthen cooperation in the struggle to liberate West Irian.

    印度尼西亚决定成立全国性机构
    统一领导解放西伊里安斗争
    新华社雅加达13日电　印度尼西亚陆军参谋长发言人哈索诺在11日宣布，陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安根据政府最近作出的决定，决定从现在起把一切同解放西伊里安的斗争有关的工作都通过名为解放西伊里安全国阵线的统一组织来进行。哈索诺指出，采取这个措施是为了保证这一斗争的统一领导。
    哈索诺说，解放西伊里安全国阵线的全国和地方组织将分别在全国和地方的军权执掌者的主持下，根据国家安全委员会制订的原则进行工作。
    以前，印度尼西亚总理朱安达曾经在1957年12月21日宣布，争取解放西伊里安的斗争由国家安全委员会领导。国家安全委员会是由三位副总理、几位内阁部长以及三军参谋长等人组成的。
    纳苏蒂安最近曾经同印度尼西亚军人、青年、工人、农民阵线举行会议，会上确定了解放西伊里安全国阵线的工作计划。军人、青年、工人、农民阵线是印度尼西亚军人和青年合作组织以及一些工人和农民的组织为了在争取解放西伊里安斗争中加强合作，在1957年11月间组成的联合机构。
