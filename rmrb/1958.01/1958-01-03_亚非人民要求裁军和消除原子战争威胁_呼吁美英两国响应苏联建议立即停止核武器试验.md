The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference Resolution on Disarmament and Elimination of the Threat of Atomic War

The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference regrets that:

New attempts are being made to accelerate the arms race on a larger scale, to formulate new plans for nuclear weapon testing, to establish atomic war bases in Europe, Asia, Africa, and other regions of the world, and to strengthen military blocs;

The decision made by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at its recent meeting to supply its member states with nuclear and rocket weapons has intensified the Cold War;

Airplanes are constantly carrying nuclear bombs, and even a slight accident could trigger an atomic war. Therefore, the threat of atomic war to humanity, especially to the people of Asia and Africa, is becoming more serious.

The Conference believes that nuclear weapons testing is a dangerous sign of preparation for atomic war. We demand an immediate and unconditional ban on such tests as the first step towards a complete ban on the manufacture, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons and universal disarmament.

We oppose the transportation of nuclear and rocket weapons to foreign countries and oppose the establishment and expansion of military bases, especially atomic war bases, in foreign countries.

We demand that the major powers must first reduce their armed forces and armaments, and we demand that the United Nations Organization take decisive steps in this regard.

We firmly believe that Asia and Africa should be a zone of peace, where there should be no nuclear or rocket weapons.

We, the people of Asian and African countries, call on the people of all countries in the world to unanimously support these resolutions. This joint action by the people of all countries on a global scale can play a decisive role. The power of the people of all countries is greater than the power of nuclear weapons, and it can eliminate the threat of atomic war.

The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference's Proposal on Taking Joint Action Against Nuclear Weapons

The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference has made important resolutions regarding the prohibition of nuclear weapons. To turn the resolutions into action, it proposes the following steps:

I. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference supports the Fourth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, scheduled to be held in August 1958, and expresses its full cooperation with this conference.

II. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference recommends that the people of Asian and African countries take joint action on March 1, 1958, to stop the United States from conducting nuclear tests on Eniwetok Atoll.

III. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference supports the idea of convening a World People's Conference for Disarmament and Peaceful Coexistence in 1958.

The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference Resolution Calling on the Governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom to Ban Nuclear Weapons Testing

The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference believes that the continuation of nuclear weapons testing is a serious threat to humanity. We demand an immediate and unconditional ban on testing as the first step towards a complete ban on the manufacture, stockpiling, and use of such weapons of mass destruction, and as a step towards universal disarmament.

Since the Soviet government has announced that it is willing to cease nuclear weapons testing from January 1958, we call on the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom to adopt the same attitude.

For the peace and happiness of the people of the world, an agreement must be reached on this issue.

The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference Resolution Appealing to Scientists Around the World

Scientists all over the world!

The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference appeals to you. You know better than anyone the true destructive power of cruel nuclear weapons, and you are very aware of what kind of suffering humanity may endure in such an atomic war.

The threat of using atomic weapons in a new war will indeed plunge the world into universal disaster. This places an obligation on you, who will determine the future, to take all possible measures to prevent this disaster.

It is for these reasons that the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, held in Cairo, appeals to the conscience of the world, to you who are responsible for inventing these destructive weapons, to take all possible measures to put pressure on all relevant governments to ban the use of nuclear weapons and destroy those stockpiled nuclear weapons.

Let scientists all over the world not compete in inventing new weapons of mass destruction, but compete in revealing the secrets of nature, in new inventions that can serve the cause of progress for all nations and peoples.

    亚非人民要求裁军和消除原子战争威胁
    呼吁美英两国响应苏联建议立即停止核武器试验
    亚非人民团结大会关于裁军和消除原子战争威胁的决议
    亚非人民团结大会感到遗憾的是：
    人们正在实行新的企图，想要加速进行更大规模的军备竞赛，想要制定核武器试验的新计划，想要在欧洲、亚洲和非州以及世界其他地区设立原子战争基地，并且想要加强军事集团；
    北大西洋公约组织在最近的会议上作出的关于以核武器和火箭武器供给它的成员国的决定加剧了冷战；
    飞机不断携带着核炸弹，甚至稍有意外，就可能爆发原子战争。因此，原子战争对人类、特别是对亚非人民的威胁就更加严重了。
    大会认为核武器试验是准备原子战争的危险表示。我们要求立即并且无条件地禁止这种试验，作为完全禁止制造、储存和使用核武器和普遍裁军的第一步。
    我们反对把核武器和火箭武器运到外国去，反对在外国建立和扩大军事基地，特别是原子战争基地。
    我们要求一定要首先进行大国裁减武装部队和军备的工作，我们要求联合国组织在这方面采取决定性的步骤。
    我们坚决认为亚非应该是和平区，在这个地区里不应该有核武器和火箭武器。
    我们亚非国家人民要求全世界各国人民一致支持这些决议。这种在世界范围进行的各国人民的共同行动能够起决定性的作用。各国人民的力量比核武器力量强大，它能够消除原子战争的威胁。
        亚非人民团结大会关于采取共同行动反对核武器的建议
    亚非人民团结大会在禁止核武器方面作出了重要的决议。为了使决议变成行动，它建议采取下列步骤：
    一、亚非人民团结大会支持定于1958年8月举行的反对原子弹和氢弹的第四届世界大会，并且表示同这次大会进行充分合作。
    二、亚非人民团结大会建议亚非各国人民于1958年3月1日采取共同行动，以阻止美国在恩纳威托克岛进行核试验。
    三、亚非人民团结大会支持关于在1958年召开争取裁军与和平共处的世界人民大会的意见。
        亚非人民团结大会关于呼吁美国、苏联和英国的政府
                    禁止核武器试验的决议
    亚非人民团结大会认为，继续进行核武器试验是对人类的一种严重威胁。我们要求，立即无条件地禁止进行试验，作为引向完全禁止制造、贮存和使用这种大规模毁灭性武器的第一步，并且作为引向普遍裁军的一个步骤。
    由于苏联政府已经宣布，它愿意从1958年1月开始停止核武器试验，我们呼吁美国政府和联合王国的政府采取同样的态度。
    为了全世界人民的和平和幸福，必须就这个问题达成协议。
          亚非人民团结大会关于向全世界科学家呼吁的决议
    全世界的科学家们！
    亚非人民团结大会向你们呼吁。你们比任何人都更加知道残忍的核武器的真正毁灭能力，你们非常了解，在这样的原子战争中，人类可能遭受到什么样的痛苦。
    在新的战争中使用原子武器的威胁，的确会使全世界陷于普遍的灾难。这就使得决定将来的你们有义务采取一切可能的方法来防止这种灾难。
    正是为了这些原因，在开罗举行的亚非人民团结大会才向全世界的良心呼吁，向你们这些对发明这种毁灭性的武器负有责任的人们呼吁，要求采取一切可能的措施向所有的有关政府施加压力，来禁止使用核武器和销毁那些贮存的核武器。
    让全世界的科学家们不要在发明新的大规模毁灭性武器方面进行竞赛，而要在揭露大自然的秘密方面、在可以为各民族和各国人民的进步事业服务的新发明方面进行竞赛。
