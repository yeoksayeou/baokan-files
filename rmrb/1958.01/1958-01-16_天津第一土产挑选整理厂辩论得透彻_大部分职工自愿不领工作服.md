Thorough Debate at Tianjin No. 1 Native Produce Selection and Sorting Factory: Most Employees Voluntarily Decline Work Uniforms

(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Tianjin Daily: The Tianjin Branch of the China National Native Produce Export Corporation's No. 1 Native Produce Selection and Sorting Factory launched a vigorous airing of views, big debates, and major contentions, correctly resolving the issue of work uniforms.

In the past, this factory issued a new set of work uniforms to each employee every year. Now, about 99% of the factory's employees have two sets of work uniforms (only a very few who joined the factory last year have only one set). Most of the work uniforms issued the year before last are 50% new, some 80% new, and a few are brand new. A small number are worn out and need to be reissued. To save cotton cloth, the factory leadership decided before the rectification movement that they would not issue a new set of work uniforms to everyone last year. Those old ones that could be repaired and worn would be repaired and worn, and those that needed to be reissued would be reissued. At that time, they registered, and only more than 300 out of 1,100 workers needed to receive new work uniforms. However, this issue had not been fully discussed, and some people's thinking had not been straightened out. Therefore, at the beginning of the rectification movement, big-character posters appeared in the airing of views area saying, "Why aren't work uniforms being issued this year?", "Where did the work uniforms go?", "We workers firmly demand work uniforms", "Urgent!", "Urgent!", "Urgent!", "Even the mute is speaking!", Some people even used hundreds of small characters of "work uniform" on the big-character posters to form three big characters of "work uniform" and set a deadline for the leadership to reply. Some people not only demanded work uniforms but also cotton-padded jackets.

The situation developed to the point where the airing of views could not continue, and the rectification could not be carried out without quickly resolving the work uniform issue. The Party Branch analyzed and studied this issue and believed that it was correct and should be upheld to cancel the practice of issuing a set of work uniforms to everyone every year, based on actual needs and ensuring that workers had work uniforms to wear. Everyone unanimously agreed that this issue should be handed over to the masses for debate, and as long as the situation was clarified and the reasons were explained, the masses would be able to distinguish right from wrong and support the correct opinions. Subsequently, meetings of Party members, Youth League members, and activists were held to listen to their opinions. The vast majority of them recognized the importance of saving cotton cloth and expressed their willingness not to receive new work uniforms. Based on this, the issue was immediately raised for debate among the masses.

During the group discussions, the first two big-character posters advocating not receiving work uniforms appeared in the airing of views area. One was jointly written by the foremen, and the other was written by two Communist Youth League members. However, immediately after that, a big-character poster signed "Group Nineteen" was posted on the wall. This big-character poster read: "The foremen are young masters, not working all day. If we were foremen, we would not only not receive work uniforms, but also pay the factory back two sets every year..." Another big-character poster signed Zhang Yunqi said, "The factory director only speaks one side. We deal with baskets and boxes every day, doing rough work, and the work uniforms have been torn to shreds... Those who don't work all day, just strolling around, their work uniforms are still in good condition!..." After these two big-character posters were posted, the airing of views area became silent again. Those who had originally expressed that they would no longer receive work uniforms were afraid to express their opinions, being labeled as "suppressing the airing of views," and dared not speak.

In response to this situation, the Party Branch convened meetings of Party members, Youth League members, some veteran workers, and other activists to support their correct opinions, give them backing, and encourage them to boldly express their opinions and actively participate in the debate. As a result, the atmosphere in the entire factory suddenly became active. A big-character poster written by Communist Youth League member Li Tiyou appeared in the airing of views area, "Refuting Group Nineteen": "The foremen work with us, why do you say they are young masters?... Most of us workers are not receiving new work uniforms, who are you referring to when you say 'workers'?" Following this, dozens of positive big-character posters were posted. Some questioned, "What is this talk about dividing workers into three classes and nine ranks? Say who is not working?..." A big-character poster signed "Courtyard Male Workers Group" said in "Ironclad Facts": "Zhang Yunqi said that he deals with baskets every day and the work uniforms are torn to shreds. Our group also deals with baskets every day, but our work uniforms are still in good condition. We will not receive them this year..." Heated debates also unfolded in the group meetings. Many people presented concrete facts to show that the current work uniforms could still be worn and there was no need to receive new ones. Veteran worker Lin Yuhua said: "The work uniform issued to me in 1955 is still being worn, and the one issued in 1956 has only been washed two or three times and is very new. We have work uniforms, why do we have to have new ones? We must remember the source of our blessings and think about how hard our farmer brothers work to grow cotton! Now that the supply of cotton cloth is tight, we are spending it so lavishly. Who are we worthy of?!" Worker Zhang Jiarui said: "If everyone wants another set, the whole factory will use more than ten thousand feet of cotton cloth. How difficult is it for workers and peasants to produce this cloth? We should save what we can save." Veteran workers Zhang Shujuan and Xie Guizhen said excitedly: "Now that we are masters of our own house, if the work uniform is a little old, we can mend it and wear it to save cotton cloth for the country. Isn't it all for ourselves? We should be thrifty in managing our household, only then are we worthy of being masters."

Through this great debate, many people understood the truth and expressed their willingness not to receive work uniforms. Some people said that they only considered their own personal interests at first, forgetting the interests of the country. Many workers said: "Saving cotton cloth and saving work uniforms, we of the working class should take the lead!" The final statistics showed that only more than 110 people whose work uniforms were indeed tattered and requested to be replaced, and many non-production personnel also returned more than 20 sets of work uniforms that were not needed. In this way, a total of more than 18,000 feet of cotton cloth can be saved for the country.

This debate not only solved the problem of work uniforms, but also gave everyone a lesson in socialism. The workers' production enthusiasm is high, a new atmosphere has emerged in production, the political atmosphere in the factory has become active, and criticism and self-criticism have also been greatly strengthened.

### 天津第一土产挑选整理厂辩论得透彻  大部分职工自愿不领工作服

    请看两个工厂的两种做法
    一个领导群众向前走　一个迁就落后做尾巴
    天津第一土产挑选整理厂辩论得透彻
    大部分职工自愿不领工作服
    本报讯　据天津日报报道：中国土产出口公司天津分公司第一土产挑选整理厂发动职工大鸣大放，大辩大争，正确地解决了工作服的问题。
    这家工厂过去每年每人发一套新工作服。现在全厂有99％左右的人都有两身工作服（极少数去年进厂工作的人只一身），前年发的工作服，大部分是五成新的，一部分八成新，个别的还是全新的，少数的破旧了，需要补发。为了节约棉布，早在整风运动前，工厂的领导上就决定去年不再每人发一身新工作服，旧的能补能穿的，就补着穿，需要补发的补发，当时登记了一下，一千一百工人中，需要领新工作服的只有三百多人。但是，这个问题，没有经过充分的讨论，有些人思想并未搞通，所以整风一开始，鸣放园地上就出现了“为什么今年不发工作服”，“工作服那儿去了？”、“我们工人坚决要工作服”、“急”“急”“急”、“哑巴也说话了”等大字报，有的人还在大字报上用几百个“工作服”小字堆成“工作服”三个大字，限期要领导答复。有的人不仅提出要工作服，还要棉袄。
    事情发展到不迅速解决工作服问题，鸣也鸣不下去，改也改不下去。党总支分析研究了这个问题，认为按照实际需要，在保证工人有工作服穿的情况下，取消每年每人发一套工作服的惯例，是正确的，应当坚持。大家一致认为应当把这问题交给群众去辩论，只要摆清情况，讲明道理，群众是能够辨明是非，支持正确的意见的。接着，召开党、团员和积极分子会议，听取他们的意见，绝大多数人都认识到节约棉布的重要意义，纷纷表示不领新工作服。在这基础上，立即把问题提到群众中去辩论。
    各小组讨论的时候，鸣放园地上首次出现了主张不领工作服的两张大字报。一张是工长们联名写的，一张是两个共青团员写的。可是，紧接着，一张署名“第十九组”的大字报贴在墙上，这张大字报写着：“工长是少爷，整天不干活，如果我们是工长，不但不领工作服，而且每年还倒贴厂方两身……”。另一张署名张运起的大字报说，“厂长光讲一面，我们天天和筐子、箱子打交道，干粗活，工作服已经破烂得飞花了……整天不干活，蹓蹓躂躂的人，工作服才还好着呢！……”这两张大字报贴出来以后，鸣放园地上又沉默下来，原来表示不再领工作服的人，怕说出自己的意见，被说成“压制鸣放”，也不敢说话了。
    针对这种情况，党总支召开了党、团员、部分老工人和其他积极分子的会议，支持他们的正确意见，给他们撑腰，并鼓励他们大胆发表自己的意见，积极参加辩论。这样，全厂的气氛顿时活跃起来。鸣放园地上出现了共青团员李体有写的“驳十九组”的大字报：“工长与我们一块干活，为什么说他们是少爷？……我们工人大多数不领新工作服，你指的工人是谁呢？……”紧跟着，几十张正面的大字报张贴出来了。有的责问：“把工人分成三流九等是什么话？说说谁是不干活的？……”一张署名“院心男工组”写的“铁的事实”大字报说：“张运起说整天和筐篓打交道，工作服都破的飞花了，我们小组也是整天和筐篓打交道，工作服都还好好的，今年我们不领了。……”在小组会上，也都热烈展开辩论。许多人摆出了具体事实说明现在的工作服还可以穿，用不着再领。老工人林玉华说：1955年发给我的工作服，现在还穿着，1956年发的，才下水两三次，新得很；咱们有了工作服，为什么非要新的？咱们要饮水思源，想想农民兄弟流汗种棉花，多么辛苦！现在棉布供应紧张，咱们却大手大脚的要，这对得起谁呢！工人张家瑞说：要是每人再要一身，全厂就要多用棉布一万好几千尺，工人农民生产这些布多么不易？该节约的，咱们应当节约。老工人张淑娟、谢桂珍激动地说：“现在自己当家作主，工作服旧了一点，补着穿，为国家节约棉布，还不是为了自己？咱们应该勤俭当家，才像个主人。”
    通过这场大辩论，许多人明白了道理，纷纷表示不要工作服了。有的人说，当初只考虑个人利益，忘了国家利益。许多工人说：“节约棉布，节约工作服，咱工人阶级就应当带头！”最后统计结果，工作服确实破烂，要求换新的，只有一百一十多人，很多非生产人员还把用不着的工作服交回了二十多套。这样，共计可以为国家节约一万八千多尺棉布。
    这场辩论，不仅仅解决了工作服的问题，而且也给大家上了社会主义的一课，工人们的生产情绪高涨，生产出现了新气象，工厂的政治空气活跃起来，批评与自我批评也大大加强了。
