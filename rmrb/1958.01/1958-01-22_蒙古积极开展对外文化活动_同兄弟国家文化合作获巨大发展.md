Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, January 21st: At a press conference on January 21st, Mongolian Deputy Minister of Culture, Bo Lede, introduced Mongolia's recent developments in foreign cultural activities, stating that during the Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957), Mongolia signed cultural cooperation agreements or cultural cooperation plans with socialist countries, and expanded its foreign cultural liaison work. These measures were of great benefit to strengthening cultural ties and friendly cooperation between Mongolia and various socialist countries.

Bo Lede said that since 1952, Mongolia has held "Mongolia-Soviet Friendship Month" every year; "Friendship Ten-Day" and "Friendship Week" activities have also been held between Mongolia and other fraternal countries to promote cultural exchange. During the Second Five-Year Plan, Mongolia sent thirteen art troupes to perform abroad, and in 1957, for the first time, sent an art troupe to a capitalist country - France, to perform. During this period, the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries also sent art troupes to visit Mongolia. Mongolia and its fraternal countries held painting and photo exhibitions and exchanged films. Mongolia has now dubbed ten Soviet films with Mongolian narration. Mongolia has also sent twelve writers to visit foreign countries, while twenty foreign writers have visited Mongolia. Mongolia has translated literary works from the Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia, and other countries, and some works by Mongolian writers have also been translated and published abroad. In sports, Mongolia's participation in international competitions is also increasing.

Bo Lede said that in 1956 and 1957, ninety-two scholars, journalists, and other cultural figures from twenty capitalist countries visited Mongolia. They were interested in Mongolia's cultural construction.

Speaking about Mongolia's foreign cultural activities plan for 1958, Bo Lede said that Mongolia has already signed cultural cooperation implementation plans with fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and North Korea this year, and will soon hold discussions with China and Czechoslovakia on signing cultural cooperation plans. Bo Lede also talked about the prospects for Mongolia to develop cultural ties with Southeast Asian countries.
