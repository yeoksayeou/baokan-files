A Great Debate in Qian Ting Township Agricultural Cooperative
Refuting the Idea of Relying on the State to Build Water Conservancy Projects

(Reported by Fujian Daily) In Qian Ting Township, Zhangpu County, Fujian Province, a great debate on "Who should we rely on to build water conservancy projects?" refuted the idea of simply relying on state loans to build water conservancy projects. The whole township mobilized 70% of its labor force and raised its own funds to build water conservancy projects on a large scale. The plan is to eliminate more than 3,700 mu of drought-stricken land before the spring plowing season, accounting for 46.05% of the total cultivated land in the township.

Qian Ting Township is located on the coast. A month without rain will cause serious drought, and the state must supply 600,000 jin of grain every year. When the township Party branch put forward the call to build water conservancy projects on a large scale and strive for a great leap forward in agriculture in 1958, some cadres and masses emphasized the difficulties, believing that water conservancy projects could not be built without government loans and subsidies. In order to reverse this thinking of simply relying on the government, the Party branch adopted the method of a great debate, focusing on the question of "Who should we rely on to build water conservancy projects?" Each cooperative and team held debate meetings. Some people said that the township suffered from drought every year, the hoes had no steel, and the dustpans had no ears, so of course we had to rely on government loans to build water conservancy projects. But immediately someone raised objections, saying: In the few years since liberation, Qian Ting Township has suffered from drought year after year, and the government has already provided more than 30,000 yuan in loans, and more than 20,000 yuan has not yet been repaid. The state is engaged in large-scale construction and needs money everywhere. How can it lend us more money? Some people said: Building water conservancy projects is also for our own benefit, so why must the government pay for it? The issues of funds, tools, and technology for water conservancy construction in the township were also resolved through careful planning and brainstorming during the great debate. Of the funds needed for water conservancy construction in the township in 1958, in addition to the 7,300 yuan that the cooperative can allocate from the public accumulation fund, plus the investment of the members, there is no need to ask the state for loans and subsidies; if there is no technology, experienced and skilled old farmers will be selected from the members to provide guidance; if there are no stones for building culverts, the members will climb over mountains and ridges to find stones.

Through the great debate, the members of Qian Ting Township threw themselves into the work of building water conservancy projects and digging ponds with full confidence. It is estimated that the first batch of sixty-two water conservancy projects can be completed before the Spring Festival; the second batch of three hundred and fifty-seven water conservancy projects can also be completed before the spring plowing season. With the completion of these projects, the township can increase its grain production by more than 270,000 jin this year. (Attached picture)

    前亭乡农业社里一场大辩论
    驳倒依赖国家兴修水利的思想
    本报讯　据福建日报消息：在福建省漳浦县前亭乡，一场“靠谁兴修水利”的大辩论，驳倒了单纯依赖国家贷款修水利的思想。全乡抽出了70％的劳动力，并自筹资金，大兴水利，计划在春耕前消灭旱灾田三千七百多亩，占全乡农田总面积的46.05％。
    前亭乡地处沿海，只要一月不雨，就会造成严重旱灾，每年都要国家供应六十万斤粮食。当乡的党支部提出大修水利，争取1958年农业大跃进的号召时，有些干部和群众强调困难，认为没有政府贷款、补助，就修不成水利。为了扭转这种单纯依赖政府的思想，党支部就采用了大辩论的方法，围绕“靠谁兴修水利”问题开展争论。各社各队普遍召开了辩论会，有人说，本乡年年受旱，锄头没了钢、畚箕没了耳，当然要靠政府贷款，才修得成水利。但马上有人提出反对意见，他们说：解放几年来前亭乡由于连年受旱，政府已贷给了三万多元贷款，至今还有二万多元未还清，国家大搞建设，处处都要钱，那能再贷款给我们。有的人说：兴修水利也是为了自己的利益，为什么一定要政府出钱。对于本乡兴修水利的资金、工具和技术等问题，在大辩论的过程中经过仔细筹划和想办法，也得到了解决。全乡1958年兴修水利所需资金，除合作社可从公积金拨出七千三百元外，再加上社员投资，就不必向国家要贷款、补助；没有技术，就从社员中挑选出较有经验、有技术的老农来指导；筑涵洞没有石头，社员翻山越岭找来了石头。
    通过了大辩论，前亭乡的社员信心百倍地投入修水利、挖池塘的工作。预计第一批六十二处水利工程，在春节前就可完成；第二批三百五十七处水利工程，在春耕前也可完成。修好这些工程，今年全乡就可增产二十七万多斤粮食。（附图片）
