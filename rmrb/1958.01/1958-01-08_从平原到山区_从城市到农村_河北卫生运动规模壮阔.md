    From Plains to Mountains, From Cities to Villages:
    Hebei's Patriotic Health Campaign is Magnificent

    The leadership at all levels in Hebei Province attaches great importance to the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the "Four Pests." On the eve of New Year's Day 1958, the Hebei Provincial Department of Health, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture, the Grain Bureau, the Red Cross, the Health Association, and other relevant departments jointly issued a notice to all departments under the special counties, requiring them to launch a mass patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the "Four Pests" during the New Year and Spring Festival. In the past few days, the campaign has reached a climax in most areas. More than 200 villages in Linzhang, Pinggu, Xianghe, and Hejian counties have captured more than 22,300 rats and 34,900 sparrows. Some villages in Linzhang County have eliminated about 50 catties of overwintering fly pupae. According to inspections by the Provincial Department of Health, more than 410 "Four-Nil" villages have emerged in Linzhang, Zhangbei, Wanquan, Hejian, Xianxian and other counties.

    The characteristics of this year's patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the "Four Pests" in the province are that the Party Committee Secretary personally takes action, cadres take the lead, arrangements are made at all levels, every household is mobilized, the campaign lasts for a long time, and the scale is magnificent. Zhou Dachuan, Deputy Secretary of the Zhangjiakou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally arranged the winter patriotic health campaign at a telephone conference. Hu Ziqi, Secretary of the Zhangbei County Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally led residents in Chengguan to carry out a major street cleaning. Yu Zongqi, Secretary of the Songwangda Township Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hejian County, in order to launch a mass campaign to eliminate the "Four Pests" in the entire township, specifically convened a meeting attended by 46 people, including propaganda committee members, Youth League secretaries, and doctors from the Party branches of agricultural cooperatives in various villages, and in conjunction with the production meeting, arranged for Party and League members and cadres above the level of agricultural cooperative team leader to carry out the work of eliminating the "Four Pests." All cadres in the township took the lead, and seven cadres led by Township Secretary Yu Zongqi eliminated more than 70 rats and sparrows in five days. Yu Qingzhai, a member of the Yutun Xingxing Agricultural Cooperative in this township, dug up ten rat nests and captured sixteen rats in one day of working in the fields, and also dug up 120 catties of grain. More than 200 students from Feng'erzhuang Complete Primary School formed six "Four Pests" elimination pioneer teams, capturing 344 field rats and 175 house rats in eight days.

    This year's patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the "Four Pests" is unprecedented in scale. From plains to deep mountain areas, from towns to villages, all are involved in this movement. Shenxian, Xinle, Zhengding and other counties require that each township have one or two villages free of rats and sparrows. The Tianjin Prefectural Committee and Tianjin Prefecture require each county to have three to five townships free of rats and sparrows. Zhangjiakou City will conduct two to three rounds of poison baiting for rats within a month and a half from mid-December 1957 to the end of January this year, and strive to achieve no rats or basically no rats in all districts of the city. In 1949, Zhangbei, Shangdu, Shangyi and other five counties on the Dam Plateau were areas where plague was rampant, but now they have basically eliminated the rats.

    从平原到山区　从城市到农村
    河北卫生运动规模壮阔
    本报特约新华社专稿　河北省各级领导机关，重视以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。1958年元旦前夕，河北省卫生厅、共青团河北省委、河北省农业厅、粮食厅、红十字会、卫生协会等有关部门，联合通知各专县所属部门，要求在新年、春节期间，开展一个以除四害为中心的群众性的爱国卫生运动。这几天，大部地区的运动已形成高潮。临漳、平谷、香河、河间等县的二百多个村庄，已经捕捉老鼠二万二千三百多只，麻雀三万四千九百多只。临漳县部分村庄已消灭越冬蝇蛹约五十多斤。据该省卫生厅的检查，在临漳、张北、万全、河间、献县等县，已出现了四百一十多个“四无”村。
    该省今年以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动的特点是，党委书记亲自动手，干部带头，层层布置，户户动员，运动持续时间长，规模壮阔。中共张家口地委副书记周大川，亲自在电话会议上布置冬季爱国卫生运动。中共张北县委书记胡子奇，亲自在城关领导居民开展街道大扫除。中共河间县宋王大乡书记于宗启，为了在全乡开展一个除四害的群众运动，特地召开了各村农业社党支部宣传委员、团委书记、医生等四十六人参加的会议，并结合生产会议，向党、团员、农业社队长以上干部，布置除四害工作。全乡干部以身作则，以乡书记于宗启为首的七个干部，五天时间即消灭鼠雀七十多只。这乡于屯新星农业社员于清寨下地一天挖田鼠十窝，捕鼠十六只，还挖出粮食一百二十斤。丰尔庄完全小学学生二百多人，组成六个除四害先锋队，八天捕田鼠三百四十四只，家鼠一百七十五只。
    今年以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，规模是空前的，从平原到深山地区，从城镇到农村，都投入了这个运动。深县、新乐、正定等县要求各乡出现一至二个无鼠无雀村。中共天津地委和天津专署要求各县出现三至五个无鼠无雀乡。张家口市要在1957年12月中旬到今年1月底的一个半月时间内，投药毒鼠二至三次，要在全市各区做到无鼠或基本无鼠。张北、商都、尚义等坝上五县1949年曾是鼠疫猖狂地区，现在已基本把鼠消灭干净。
