Moscow, January 12th (By our correspondent) – Soviet Minister of Trade, Pavlov, recently published an article in "Soviet Commerce News," stating that the Soviet Union's domestic commodity turnover plan for 1957 was completed ahead of schedule, with the total value of goods sold throughout the year increasing by 75 billion rubles compared to 1956. This represents the highest rate of commodity supply growth in Soviet history.

Minister Pavlov then compared the quantities of certain commodities sold by the state in 1957 with those of 1940, noting that the sales of silk fabrics increased by 8.5 times, woolen fabrics by 3.5 times, watches by 8 times, meat by 2.5 times, milk by 3 times, and sugar by more than double. To meet the people's growing needs for goods, commodity supplies will be further expanded this year. This year's plan calls for an increase of 14% in milk supply compared to last year, 21% in eggs, 21% in vegetables, 8% in sugar, 9% in leather shoes, 27% in children's shoes, 20% in furniture, 32% in washing machines, etc.

The minister also pointed out that as the lives of the Soviet people improve and their purchasing power increases, some commodities such as leather shoes and furniture are still in short supply, despite the rapid increase in commodity supply. To comprehensively solve this problem, production in these areas will be greatly expanded this year. Factories and enterprises in many economic zones have paid attention to increasing the production of people's daily necessities. For example, the Gorky Economic Zone plans to increase the production of furniture worth 32 million rubles, and the Georgian Economic Zone will produce various items worth 120 million rubles to meet the needs of the people. In addition to vigorously increasing the production of daily necessities for the people this year, further attention will be paid to improving product quality.

Pavlov said when talking about further improving commodity supply in the future: "The outline of commodity supply will continue to expand in the future, and more stores will be opened appropriately. Moreover, in order to improve store sales methods, mass supervision will be promoted. In order to make it convenient for consumers, the practice of having stores deliver ordered goods to homes and installing 35,000 vending machines in various places will be vigorously implemented.

    满足人民日益增长的物质需要
    苏联将扩大商品供应
    去年售货总值比前年增加七百五十亿卢布
    本报莫斯科12日电　苏联贸易部部长巴夫洛夫最近在“苏维埃商业报”上发表文章说：1957年苏联国内商品周转计划提前完成，全年出售商品的总金额比1956年增加了七百五十亿卢布。这是苏联历史上商品供应增长速度最高的一年。
    巴夫洛夫部长接着把1957年国家所出售的某些商品数量与1940年作了比较，其中绸缎衣料增售了八倍半，毛衣料增售了三倍半，手表八倍，肉类二倍半，奶类三倍，糖一倍多。为了满足人民日益增长中的物品需要，今年的商品供应将更为扩大。今年计划奶类供应比去年增加14％，蛋类21％，蔬菜21％，糖8％，皮鞋类9％，儿童鞋类27％，家具20％，洗衣机32％等等。
    这位部长又指出：苏联人民生活越来越好，人民购买力日益提高，因此，虽然商品供应迅速增加，但像皮鞋、家具等部分商品还是供不应求。为了全面解决这个问题，今年将大力扩大这些方面的生产。许多经济区的工厂企业对增加人民生活用品生产都引起了注意。如高尔基经济区计划增产价值三千二百万卢布的家具，格鲁吉亚经济区将多生产价值一亿二千万卢布的各式物品供给人民需要。今年除了大力增加人民日用品生产量外，将进一步注意改进产品质量。
    巴夫洛夫在谈到今后进一步改善商品供应时说：“今后商品供应纲要继续扩大，适当的多开商店。而且为了改善商店售货方法，推行群众监督。为了使消费者方便，还将大力实行由商店把订购物品送到家里的办法和在各地安装三万五千架自动售货机。
