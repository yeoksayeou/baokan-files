Huangyan County has approximately 500,000 mu of land suitable for double-wheel moldboard plow cultivation. In 1956, 1,316 double-wheel moldboard plows were promoted, with 57.4% frequently used during spring plowing, 32.5% used intermittently, and 10.1% unused. During spring plowing, over 490,000 mu of land were plowed for the first and second times, with each plow averaging 42 mu. In the spring plowing of 1957, 919 plows were put into production, accounting for 70.6% of the total number of double moldboard plows, cultivating 2,097 mu more than in 1956, with each plow averaging 55.6 mu. The First Agricultural Cooperative of Jiaokeng Township had eight double moldboard plows, each averaging 105 mu. Huangyan County's early achievement of the grain production targets stipulated in the "Forty Articles" is inseparable from the use of double moldboard plows.

Two years of practice have proven that the superiority of the double moldboard plow mainly lies in:

One, saving labor, improving work efficiency, and reducing labor intensity. According to a comparative survey by the Fifth Agricultural Cooperative of Jiaokeng Township, during the first plowing in spring, a double moldboard plow can plow 12 mu per day, while a wooden plow can only plow 5-6 mu; during the second plowing in spring, a double moldboard plow can plow 13-14 mu per day, while a wooden plow can only plow 6-7 mu; in winter plowing of hardened fields, a double moldboard plow can plow 6-7 mu per day, while a wooden plow can only plow 3 mu or slightly more.

It can be seen that the efficiency of a double moldboard plow is equivalent to two wooden plows, saving one laborer and requiring less effort. Old plowman Luo Renben said that using a wooden plow for a day makes his hands hurt and his back ache, but using a double moldboard plow doesn't matter at all.

Two, due to the double moldboard plow plowing deeper, more evenly, and turning the soil uniformly, the soil's ability to retain fertilizer is enhanced, the indica rice roots penetrate deeper, and the fertilizer absorption area is larger, resulting in widespread increases in production. The double moldboard plow can plow 0.5 to 1 cun deeper than the wooden plow. The bottom of the wooden plow is semi-circular, leaving ridges in the field after plowing, while the bottom of the double moldboard plow is flat, leaving no ridges in the field after plowing, solving the long-standing problem of "green patches" (the indica rice on the ridges is ripe, while the indica rice in the furrows is still green). Indica rice seedlings grow evenly, the stalks are stronger, the ears are longer, the grains are densely packed, and the yield is high. According to a comparative experiment at six typical points in 1956, on the same field, with the same variety, fertilizer application, intertillage, and management, the use of the double moldboard plow significantly increased production in both plains and semi-mountainous areas. The county farm, using the double moldboard plow, averaged 1,021 jin per mu, while the land using the wooden plow only yielded 975 jin. The Li Shaofu Production Team of the Mapu Cooperative in Mapu Township, using the double moldboard plow, yielded 1,076 jin per mu, while the land using the wooden plow yielded 975 jin. The Fifth Agricultural Cooperative of Jiaokeng Township and the Youth Team of Guangming Cooperative in Dongshan Township generally increased production by 9%-11% using the double moldboard plow compared to using the wooden plow.

Huangyan County has the following experiences through two years of practice:

One, overcome conservative thinking. Farmers have used wooden plows for thousands of years, and the force of habit is deeply rooted. When the double moldboard plow was first tested in the agricultural cooperative, Shen Rensong, a farmer in Jiaokeng Township, reflected that the double moldboard plow had eight "deaths": the plow is heavy and difficult to carry, "carry to death"; the cow is small and difficult to pull, "pull to death"; the road is small and the field is small and cannot be plowed, "annoy to death"; the field corners are large and difficult to manage, "snag to death"; members complain that they cannot make ridges, "complain to death"; slow efficiency leads to absenteeism, "旷工 to death"; the plow price is high and the burden is heavy, "burden to death"; plowmen plow poorly and members scold, "scold to death". However, Huangyan has consistently adhered to the method of "typical demonstration, organizing visits, expanding publicity, organizing the masses to speak from experience, and educating the masses." At the end of 1955, the county party committee organized a comparative performance exhibition of tractors, double moldboard plows, and wooden plows in Mapu Township, which was visited by more than 20,000 cadres and masses from the county. The masses unanimously reflected that wooden plows were not as good as double moldboard plows, and using double moldboard plows instead of tractors was excellent. Before the spring plowing in 1956, a socialist construction exhibition room with new agricultural tools as its main content was opened in the county seat and Luqiao Town. Double moldboard plows were also promoted using display windows, blackboards, and wired broadcasts, greatly encouraging the confidence of cadres and the masses in using them. The aforementioned Jiaokeng Township also organized ten excellent agricultural tool handlers, seven double moldboard plows, and mobilized more than 100 members to conduct a "plowing competition" to address the ideological concerns of the masses. When the early indica rice was harvested, the land using the double moldboard plow increased production by 54 jin per mu, so the masses reflected that the double moldboard plow had nine advantages: plowing deep and evenly is good; uniform soil turning covers the grass well; plowing quickly is good; easy operation saves effort well; the soil is finely crushed and easy to prepare well; no plow ridges make transplanting less prone to lodging well; robust development and uniform growth is good; can plow hard soil well; high yield increases income well. In 1957, at the county people's congress, the four-level cadre conference, the labor model conference, and the county farm visiting conference, the successful experience of Jiaokeng Township in using double moldboard plows and the increased production examples from the comparative experiments at five points, including the county farm and the Mapu Cooperative, were used to educate more than 10,000 people on the superiority of double moldboard plows. In addition, the leaders also organized excellent agricultural tool handlers from Jiaokeng and Hengjie Townships to conduct demonstration performances and introduce their experience in using double moldboard plows to various township and agricultural cooperative technical training classes, thereby reversing the right-leaning and fearful thinking in some areas.

Two, strengthen technical guidance and train agricultural tool handlers at all levels. The training conducted before the spring plowing in 1957 focused on quality, taking quantity into account; in terms of methods, practical operation was the main focus, supplemented by explanation; in terms of steps, the district trained instructors, and the township trained fixed plowmen. A total of more than 1,700 plowmen were trained in the county. Due to the importance attached to it by the district and township leaders, coupled with the appropriate selection of trainees, the quality of training was high. They were very popular with the masses when they went down to educate them on the use of double moldboard plows. For example, the 24th team of the 4th cooperative of Honghu Township was initially unfamiliar with the technology, unaccustomed to the two cows walking side by side, and the field corners were large, so they were preparing not to use the double moldboard plow. Chen Zhiliang of the Xinqiao Supply and Marketing Cooperative had been trained in the use of double moldboard plows. He helped the team plow all 37 mu of the first plowing field with the double moldboard plow, which the masses were very satisfied with. The plowmen of the First and Fifth Agricultural Cooperatives of Jiaokeng Township held a meeting every night during the spring plowing to explore the operational routes for making ridges, breaking ridges, hardened fields, first plowing, and second plowing, and drew them into diagrams, and taught the key issues such as the first plow, the last plow, plowing the field edges, and the field corners to the agricultural tool handlers, thus cultivating a group of excellent agricultural tool handlers.

Three, understanding the ideology and learning the technology does not mean that the double moldboard plow can be used smoothly. Labor organization and the matching of plowing cattle must be properly arranged and reasonably resolved. Huangyan County has adopted a "five fixations and three guarantees" system in this regard to ensure the use of double moldboard plows. The five fixations are: fixing people, fixing two to three plowmen per plow; fixing cattle, stipulating that good cattle should first serve the double moldboard plow; fixing fields, dividing the contiguous fields to be cultivated by the double moldboard plow through unified queuing; fixing quality, plowing deep, even, uniform, and without omission, plowing half a cun to one cun deeper than wooden plows; fixing points, setting a minimum quota of six mu and a maximum quota of twelve mu per day based on technical level. When first used, if the quota was not reached, work points were recorded according to the wooden plow quota; if the quota was exceeded, a reward of one to one and a half points per mu was given.

Three guarantees: guarantee the plow, check frequently, add oil frequently, assign a special person to take care of it to ensure that it does not rust, does not lose parts, and pay a maintenance fee of ten points per season; guarantee the cattle, assign a special person to maintain them, and implement a maintenance system of eating five full meals a day and resting five times during cultivation; guarantee the teaching of technology, establish a technology research group, hold frequent meetings to exchange experience, and good plowmen teach assistants. In addition, an inspection and reward and punishment system was also stipulated.

Four, establishing semi-mechanized production teams in areas with suitable conditions and fully using double moldboard plows and rice threshing machines with disc harrows is a higher-level production form from the "five fixations and three guarantees" method. The conditions for establishing a semi-mechanized production team are: contiguous and flat land, widened and straightened roads; high awareness among production team members; high cultivation technology, sufficient animal power; the area of the field and the fixed quota cultivated by each double moldboard plow should be compatible, about 60 mu. The semi-mechanized production team of the First Agricultural Cooperative has 338 mu of land, six plows, and after completing its own first and second plowing fields, it also plowed 24 mu for the Second Team, with each plow cultivating 30 mu more than each plow in the adjacent team's "five fixations and three guarantees" form.

The establishment of this semi-mechanized production team not only facilitates cultivation, saves labor, and improves efficiency, but also facilitates mutual learning between leaders and technicians, and facilitates the promotion of the superiority of new agricultural tools.

Five, when using double moldboard plows for cultivation, it is necessary to appropriately widen the roads accordingly. Rural roads are narrow and inconvenient for transportation, requiring two people to carry them. At the same time, small and fragmented plots of land will also prevent the plow from playing its role. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically renovate the land, abolish field ridges, merge field blocks, and widen roads to adapt to the use of double moldboard plows for cultivation.

In the spring of 1957, the First Agricultural Cooperative of Jiaokeng Township mobilized more than 500 members to build and widen four crossroads and two bridges by means of voluntary labor, combined eight small hills into large hills, and straightened more than 20 field corners. In this way, the double moldboard plow can pass through the small road from the cooperative's tool room all the way to the field, which saves effort, and people and plows will not fall and break; combining fields into large fields and straightening field corners facilitates cultivation, which can reduce labor waste and improve cultivation efficiency; merging field blocks, abolishing field ridges, and widening roads, the cultivated area is slightly expanded after offsetting the more and less; it is conducive to various other productions. Members reflect that not only double moldboard plows, but also carrying grain, carrying fertilizer, and lifting rice threshing machines are all beneficial.

Six, while promoting double moldboard plows, attention should also be paid to the allocation of plowing cattle. There are few cattle and many fields in the Huangyan plain area, so they have taken many measures to solve this problem, such as holding cattle appraisal and exchange meetings; adjusting within the agricultural cooperative; and leasing from mountainous areas.

    黄岩县使用双轮双铧犁增了产
    吴樟有
    浙江黄岩县适合双轮双铧犁耕作的面积约五十万亩。1956年推广了双轮双铧犁一千三百一十六台，在春耕中经常使用的占57.4％，间歇使用占32.5％，未使用的占10.1％。在春耕中耕头翻和二翻田四十九万多亩，每台平均耕四十二亩；1957年春耕投入生产九百一十九台，占双铧犁总数的70.6％，比1956年多耕作二千零九十七亩，每台平均犁五十五点六亩。蕉坑乡第一农业社八台双铧犁，每台平均犁一百零五亩。黄岩县提前实现“四十条”规定的粮食产量指标，是和使用双铧犁分不开的。
    二年来实践证明，双铧犁的优越性主要是：
    一、节省劳动力，提高工作效率，减低劳动强度。根据蕉坑乡第五农业社调查对比，在春耕头翻，双铧犁每天翻耕十二亩，木犁则只能翻五、六亩；春耕二翻，双铧犁每天翻地十三到十四亩，木犁只有六、七亩；冬耕板田双铧犁每天翻六、七亩，木犁只能翻三亩或稍多一点。
    由此可以看出双铧犁的效率能抵上二部木犁，节省一个劳动力。并且不需费大劲。老犁手罗仁本说，用木犁耕一天，手痛腰酸；用双铧犁一点没有关系。
    二、由于双铧犁耕得深、耕得平、翻土匀、土地蓄肥力增强、籼根扎得深，吸肥面大，普遍增了产。双铧犁比木犁能深耕五分至一寸。木犁犁底是半圆形，耕后田底有脊，而双铧犁底一样平，耕后田里无脊，解决了历年的畦青问题（畦上的籼已成熟，沟上的籼还发青），籼苗生长均匀，籼梗较坚硬，籼穗长，结实密，谷粒饱满，产量高。根据1956年六个典型点对比试验，在同一块田，同等品种，施肥、中耕和管理都相同，但使用双铧犁的不论平原区和半山区都显著增产。县农场使用双铧犁的地，平均每亩产量一千零二十一斤，而使用木犁的地只有九百七十五斤；马铺乡马铺社李绍福生产队使用双铧犁的地，每亩产量一千零七十六斤，使木犁的地是九百七十五斤。蕉坑乡第五农业社、东山乡光明社青年队，使用双铧犁的产量一般比使用木犁的提高9％—11％。
    黄岩县通过二年实践，有以下几点经验：
    一、要克服保守思想。农民使用木犁有几千年历史，习惯势力根深柢固。当在农业社第一次试验双铧犁时，蕉坑乡农民沈仁松就反映双铧犁有八个死：犁重要扛死；牛小要拉死；路小、田小不能犁要气死；田角大要捞死；作不起畦社员反映死；效率慢旷工死；犁价贵负担死；犁手犁不好社员骂死。但是黄岩一直坚持“典型示范，组织参观，扩大宣传，组织群众现身说法，教育群众”的办法。1955年底县委在马铺乡组织了拖拉机、双铧犁、木犁对比表演展览会，全县有二万多个干部和群众前去参观。群众一致反映：木犁没有双铧犁好，没有拖拉机用双铧犁代替顶好。1956年春耕之前，又在县城和路桥镇开辟一个以新式农具为主要内容的社会主义建设展览室。还利用橱窗、黑板报、有线广播等宣传双铧犁，从而大大鼓舞干群使用的信心。上述的蕉坑乡还针对群众的思想顾虑，组织十个优秀农具手，七台双铧犁，发动一百多个社员进行“赛犁大会”。早籼收获时，使用双铧犁的地每亩增产五十四斤，从而群众反映双铧犁有九好：耕得深、耕得平好；翻土均匀盖草好；耕得快好；操作方便省力好；泥土细碎易整地好；无犁脊插秧不易伏倒好；发育粗壮，生长整齐好；能耕硬田好；产量高增加收入好。1957年在全县人代会、四级干部大会、劳模会、县农场参观会上，还利用蕉坑乡使用双铧犁成功经验及县农场、马铺社等五个点对比试验的增产实例，使一万多人受到双铧犁优越性教育。此外，领导上还组织蕉坑、横街乡优秀农具手至各乡、农业社技术训练班进行示范表演，介绍自己使用双铧犁的过程，因而扭转部分地区右倾畏难思想。
    二、加强技术辅导，层层训练农具手。1957年春耕前进行的训练，掌握以质为主，照顾数量；在方法上实地操作为主，讲解为辅；步骤上，区训练师资、乡训练固定犁手。全县共训练犁手一千七百多名。由于区乡领导重视，再加学员对象挑选适当，因此训练质量较高。他们下去教育群众使用双铧犁极受欢迎。如洪湖乡四社第二十四小队，开始不熟悉技术，二牛并走不习惯，田角大，准备不用双铧犁了。新桥供销社陈志良曾经受过使用双铧犁的训练，他帮助该队把三十七亩头翻田全部用双铧犁耕作，群众看到很满意。蕉坑乡第一、第五农业社的犁手在春耕时每夜召开碰头会，摸索出作畦、破畦、板田、头翻、二翻田的操作路线画成图，并把头犁、末犁、耕田边、田角等关键性问题传授给农具手，因而培养出了一批优秀农具手。
    三、思想搞通，技术学懂，不等于说双铧犁可以顺利使用了。对于劳动组织，耕牛搭配等工作必须妥善安排，合理解决。黄岩县在这方面采用了五定三保制度来保证双铧犁的使用。五定是定人，每台固定犁手二至三人；定牛，规定好牛先服从双铧犁；定田，通过统一排队，把连片田划给双铧犁耕作；定质，耕深、耕平、耕匀、不漏耕，比木犁耕深半寸至一寸；定分，根据技术水平，每天定额最低六亩，最高十二亩。开始使用时没有达到定额，按木犁定额记工；超过定额每亩奖励一分至一分半。
    三保：保犁，使用时勤检查、勤加油，指定专人保管，保证不生锈，不失零件，按季给保管费十分；保牛，指定专人保养，执行每天吃饱五肚，耕作时休息五次的保养制度；保教技术，建立技术研究小组，经常开碰头会，交流经验，技术好的犁手教副手。此外，还规定了检查和奖惩制度。
    四、在有条件地区建立半机械化生产队，完全使用双铧犁和打籼机圆盘耙，这是由五定三保办法走向更高一级的生产形式。建立半机械化生产队条件是：土地连片平坦，加宽改直道路；生产队社员觉悟高；耕作技术高，畜力足；田亩面积和每台双铧犁所耕定额约六十亩相适应。第一农业社半机械化生产队有三百三十八亩田，六台犁，自己头二翻田耕完，还给第二小队耕二十四亩，每台比毗邻小队五定三保形式的每台犁多耕作三十亩。
    建立这种半机械化生产队，不仅因耕作方便，节省劳力和提高效率，而且便于领导和技术员互相学习，便于宣传新式农具的优越性。
    五、使用双铧犁耕作，相适应地必须适当加宽道路。农村道路狭窄，不便运送，要用二人抬。同时土地小块零星，也会使犁不能发挥作用。因此，必须有步骤地整修土地，取消田塍，合并田块，加宽道路来适应使用双铧犁耕作。
    1957年春天蕉坑乡第一农业社发动五百多个社员，以义务劳动办法，新造和加宽四条十字路和两座桥，小丘并大丘有八丘，田角改直有二十多丘。这样双铧犁从社的农具室一直可以通过小马路到田中，既省力，人、犁又不会跌坏；田丘并大，田角改直，耕作方便，既可减少劳动力浪费，又可提高耕作效力；合并田块，取消田塍，加宽道路，多与少相抵后耕作面积稍有扩大；有利于其它各种生产。社员反映，不要说双铧犁，就是挑谷、挑肥料、抬打籼机样样都有利了。
    六、在推广双铧犁的同时，还应当注意耕牛的调配。黄岩平原地区牛少田多，所以，他们采取了许多办法来解决这个问题，如召开耕牛评比交流会；在农业社内部调剂；向山区租赁等。
