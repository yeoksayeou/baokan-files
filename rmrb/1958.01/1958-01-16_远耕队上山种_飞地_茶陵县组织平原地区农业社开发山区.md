Long-Distance Farming Teams Go to the Mountains to Cultivate "Enclaves"
Chaling County Organizes Agricultural Cooperatives in Plains Areas to Develop Mountainous Regions

(Our dispatch) To develop mountainous areas and solve the problem of insufficient labor in mountainous areas and surplus labor in plain areas, Chaling County, Hunan Province, organizes long-distance farming teams from agricultural cooperatives in plain areas to go to the mountains for production, reclaiming wasteland and improving low-yield fields (some farmers in some areas call this type of land "enclaves"). The county already has more than 5,000 long-distance farming team members, who are respectively heading to eight sparsely populated mountain townships within the county.

Chaling County is located at the foot of the Jinggang Mountains. Mountains and forests account for 81% of the total area of the county, and one-third of the total cultivated land is low-yield. These areas generally have good soil quality and abundant water sources, with great potential for increased production. However, due to their location in mountainous areas, there is a shortage of labor. Each laborer has to bear one or twenty mu of cultivated land, with a maximum of two or thirty mu or more. In some plain areas and river areas, the population is dense and the cultivated land is small. In some places, each person bears an average of less than one mu of land, resulting in a large surplus of labor.

In order to develop mountainous areas, the county tested the method of organizing long-distance farming teams in the Duli Agricultural Cooperative last year. The Duli Agricultural Cooperative is located in a plain area, with an average of only one mu of land per person. Because there is very little land, grain production is insufficient, and the state needs to supply food grain every year. During the spring plowing season last year, the county party committee mobilized 26 members from this cooperative to form a long-distance farming team, taking production tools and living materials to Aili Cooperative, thirty miles away, where there was more land and less labor, for long-distance farming. This long-distance farming team was warmly welcomed by the Aili Cooperative. The Aili Cooperative vacated houses for them to live in and allocated 57 mu of low-yield fields and a large area of wasteland for them to cultivate. The long-distance farming team cultivated a total of 84 mu of land, including 27 mu of reclaimed wasteland. Last year, the income from rice alone was more than 30,100 jin. At the same time, they also actively carried out sideline production, solving the difficulty of lacking money for living expenses. Due to the production income of the long-distance farming team, the Duli Cooperative jumped from a grain-deficient cooperative to a self-sufficient cooperative within one year.

After the Chinese Communist Party Chaling County Committee summarized the experience of the Duli Cooperative in organizing long-distance farming teams, it decided to promote this method throughout the county, and specially established two specialized institutions for improving low-yield fields and developing mountainous areas, and sent two work groups to conduct investigations and research. Before the New Year, it organized more than 5,000 laborers to go to eight mountain townships for production. The vast majority of these long-distance farming team members were organized from agricultural cooperatives with surplus labor after consultation, including some urban residents and family members of cadres. When the long-distance farming team members arrived at their destinations leading plowing cattle and carrying luggage, they were warmly welcomed and properly arranged by local farmers.

These eight mountain townships have a total of 100,000 mu of low-yield fields, accounting for two-thirds of the county's total low-yield fields. They allocated 32,000 mu of low-yield fields for the long-distance farming teams to cultivate. Now, more than 5,000 long-distance farming team members are actively settling their families and engaging in preparatory work, determined to increase the yield of these low-yield fields by 200 jin per mu this year. Their slogan is: "Go to the mountains to blossom and bear fruit, let the low-yield fields be completely turned over!" The Duli Cooperative also decided to expand the original long-distance farming team to 120 people, and plans to reclaim another 160 mu of wasteland this year.

### 远耕队上山种“飞地”  茶陵县组织平原地区农业社开发山区

    远耕队上山种“飞地”
    茶陵县组织平原地区农业社开发山区
    本报讯　为了开发山区，解决山区劳动力不足和平原区劳力过剩的问题，湖南省茶陵县从平原地区农业社组织远耕队上山生产，开垦荒地，改良低产田（有些地区农民把这种地叫做“飞地”）。全县已经有远耕队员五千多人，分别开往县内八个地广人稀的山乡。
    茶陵县在井冈山下，全县山林占总面积的81％，总耕地面积中又有三分之一的低产田。这些地方一般土质良好，水源多，增产潜力很大。但是地处山区，劳动力不足，每个劳动力要负担耕地一、二十亩，最多达到二、三十亩以上。而在部分平原地区和沿河地区又因人口密，耕地少，有些地方每人平均负担的耕地不到一亩田，劳动力大量剩余。
    为了开发山区，这个县去年在渡里农业社试行了组织远耕队的办法。渡里农业社在平原地区，每人平均只有一亩田土，因为田地很少，粮食生产不足，年年要国家供应口粮。去年春耕生产时，县委从这个社里发动了二十六个社员组成一支远耕队，带上生产工具和生活资料，到三十里外的田多劳动力少的艾里社远耕。这支远耕队受到了艾里社的热烈欢迎。艾里社腾出了房子给他们居住，并且拨出了五十七亩低产田和一大片荒地给他们耕种。远耕队连同开荒地二十七亩在内，共耕种了八十四亩田地，去年仅稻谷一项就收入三万零一百多斤。他们还同时积极地开展了副业生产，解决了生活上缺钱的困难。由于远耕队的生产收入，渡里社在一年之内就由缺粮社一跃而为自给社了。
    中共茶陵县委总结了渡里社组织远耕队的经验以后，决定在全县推广这个办法，专门成立了改良低产田和开发山区的两个专门机构，派出两个工作组进行调查研究。新年前夕，即组织了五千多个劳动力去八个山乡进行生产。这批远耕队员，绝大部分是从劳动力有剩余的农业社经过协商后抽出人力组织成的，其中还包括一部分城镇居民和干部家属。当远耕队员们牵着耕牛、挑着行李到达目的地时，受到了当地农民的热情欢迎和妥善安排。
    这八个山乡共有十万亩低产田，占全县低产田总数的三分之二。他们拨出了三万二千亩低产田给远耕队耕种。现在，五千多远耕队员正在积极地安顿家务和从事备耕工作，决心要使这些低产田今年每亩增产二百斤粮食。他们的口号是：“到山区去开花结果，让低产田彻底翻身！”渡里社也决定将原有的远耕队扩大到一百二十人，计划今年再开荒地一百六十亩。
