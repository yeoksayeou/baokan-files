    Is This Wasteful?
    To the Editor:
    There's a question I can't figure out, and I'd appreciate it if you could explain it to me.
    My husband and I are both commune cadres. For several years, whether in production or work, we've never been willing to fall behind. We work in the fields during the day and attend meetings at night, never complaining or saying "no." We work hard and live comfortably. In 1956, from the grain and cash distributed to us by the commune, after deducting the annual expenses for our family of four, we also bought ten yuan worth of public bonds and deposited twenty yuan in the bank. In 1957, we earned even more work points; he did more than two hundred and fifty, and I did more than one hundred and thirty. Although the commune's distribution work hasn't finished yet, production is much better than in previous years, so our income will naturally be higher.
    A few days ago, we went to the county to attend a meeting. We also took a look at the department store and saw those colorful sweaters, which were so beautiful that we bought one for each of the adults and children. We each bought a short cotton-padded coat with a fur collar. I bought myself a pair of corduroy cotton shoes with leather soles. In addition, I bought a bottle of vanishing cream and hair oil, and a pocket watch to keep track of time.
    Editor, it was for buying these things that we were criticized at the Party小组 meeting. They said we already have cotton clothes and sweaters, so we shouldn't buy new ones; they said I shouldn't buy leather-soled cotton shoes; they also said buying a pocket watch was impractical... The general point was that we were wasteful, not thrifty, and hadn't responded to Chairman Mao's call for "running the household diligently and thriftily," and they wanted us to examine our thinking.
    Editor, I've thought about it for a long time, but I can't figure it out. Please tell me: Isn't labor meant to improve our lives? In the old society, people saved every penny to buy land and property for future generations, to prepare for the difficulties of birth, old age, illness, and death. But we are young people of the new society. We don't need to buy land or houses, that's capitalist thinking. We're not afraid of birth, old age, illness, and death either, because we live in a socialist family, and the commune will take care of us if we have difficulties. Besides, I bought these things that are all useful, so how can it be considered wasteful? If you don't believe me, I'll tell you: This year, cloth coupons are tight, and not everyone can make new cotton clothes (my cotton clothes are already two years old!). What's wrong with buying a new sweater? My husband and I often go to meetings in the district and county, and we always wear that old cotton coat, which is really too embarrassing. Since we have money on hand, buying a coat to wear, can that be considered wasteful? They said I shouldn't buy shoes, but that's also wrong; if I don't buy them, I still have to spend work points to have them made! Vanishing cream and hair oil, that's even less, only costing two or three yuan. This watch, it seems like you could buy it or not, but spending fifteen or sixteen yuan on it, I won't be late for meetings, so what's wrong with that?
    Editor: I bought things that are all useful, and I spent money that I earned myself. Buying these things doesn't affect my family's future life, and I didn't go into debt. I just spent a few dozen yuan from the money I was going to deposit in the bank. Whether I save more or less, it's all my own. If I spend more today, I'll spend less later; it's all the same anyway. How can this be considered wasteful?
    Please tell me, how should this issue be understood?
                              Huang Xiuying
    Editor's Note: The question raised by Comrade Huang Xiuying is very important, and we hope everyone will study and discuss it.
    How should we analyze and understand this issue? This requires a comprehensive understanding of the Party's policy of building the country and managing the household diligently and thriftily, a clear understanding of the correct relationship between improving living standards and frugality, and the principled question of how to handle surplus money, so that we can distinguish between right and wrong in this matter.
    We hope everyone will participate in the discussion of this issue, and we especially welcome contributions that combine your own situations and thoughts.

### 这是浪费吗？

    这是浪费吗？编辑同志：
    我有一个问题想不通，麻烦你们给解释解释。
    我和我丈夫都是社干部。几年来不论在生产上，在工作上，我们从来不肯落后。白天下地，黑夜开会，没有叫过苦，也没有说过一个“不”字。我们劳动得积极，日子也过得舒畅。1956年，我俩在社里分得的粮食和现钱，除了全家四口一年的吃用花销以外，还买了十块钱的公债，在银行里存了二十元钱。1957年，我俩挣的劳动日更多了，他做了二百五十多个，我做了一百三十多个。社里的分配工作眼下虽然还没有结束，可是生产比往年好得多，我们的收入自然也就更多了。
    前几天，我俩到县里去开会。就便逛了逛百货公司，看到那五颜六色的绒衣真好看，就给大人孩子都买了一件；我俩一人买了一件有翻毛领的短棉大衣；我自己买了一双皮底的灯芯绒棉鞋；另外，买了一瓶雪花膏和擦头油，还买了一只马蹄表，好看看时间。
    编辑同志，就为了买这点东西，党小组开会的时候向我们提出了批评。说我们有棉衣、有绒衣，不该买新的，说我不该买皮底棉鞋，还说买马蹄表不实用，……归总是说我们浪费，不节俭，没有响应毛主席提出的“勤俭持家”的号召，要我们检查思想。
    编辑同志，我想了好久，想不通。请你告诉我：劳动难道不是为了改善生活？在旧社会，人们省吃俭用为的是买田置地传后代，为的是防备生老病死有困难。可是，我们是新社会的青年人，我们不需要买地置房，那是资本主义思想。我们也不怕生老病死，因为我们生活在社会主义大家庭里，有了困难社里会照管。再说，我买这些东西，都是用得着的，又怎能说是浪费呢？不信，我说给你听：今年布票紧，不能人人做身新棉衣（我的棉衣已经穿了二年啦！），买件新绒衣有什么不应该呢？我和小孩他爹常到区里县里去开会，总是披着那件旧大袄，实在太难看。手边既然有钱，买件大衣穿穿，这能说是浪费吗？他们说我不该买鞋，这也不对，不买也得花工做呀！雪花膏和擦头油，那更算不了什么，不过花了两三块钱。这只表，看上去是可买可不买，不过，花它十五、六块钱，开会也就误不了事，这又有什么不好呢？
    编辑同志：我买的都是用得的东西，我花的是我自己挣来的钱。我买了一些东西，既不影响我家今后生活，又没向人拉亏空，只不过把准备存到银行里的钱花了几十块。不论存钱多或少，都是我自己的。今天多花了，日后少花点；反正是一样。这怎能说是浪费呢？
    请你告诉我，对于这个问题，究竟应该怎样认识？
                              黄秀英
    编者按：黄秀英同志提出的问题很重要，希望大家来研究和讨论。
    怎样分析和认识这个问题呢？这需要全面地理解党提出的勤俭建国和勤俭持家的方针，需要明确改善生活和节俭之间的正确关系，以及有了多余的钱应该怎样处理等原则性的问题，才能分清这个问题的是和非。
    我们希望大家都来参加这个问题的讨论，特别欢迎结合自己的情况和想法来谈。
