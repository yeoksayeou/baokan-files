The friendship between us and the great Chinese people has existed for a long time. Because the Czechoslovak people, who have long lived under the arduous conditions of foreign rule, have always held deep sympathy for other nations who, like them, were forced to fight for their freedom. As early as the beginning of the 20th century, Chinese patriots rose up against imperialism, the comprador bourgeoisie and the feudal landlords of their own country. Since our youth, the arduous struggle of Chinese patriots has remained vividly in our memory. At that time, our entire progressive public was deeply shocked by the news that the European powers had used superior forces to barbarously suppress the uprising of Chinese patriots. The cruel methods of suppression were a characteristic of the colonialist policies that European powers have claimed since ancient times were in line with higher European civilization. Who was this policy directed against? It was against a nation with one of the oldest cultures. The culture of this nation had reached a high level even before the emergence of early European civilization; this nation's culture is manifested in the great architecture of ancient China, and in the vibrant Chinese plastic arts. The invention of Chinese printing, which became the cultural foundation of all other nations, proves the high cultural level of the Chinese people. The racial theories promoted by the European imperialists, attempting to degrade the image of the lovable and intelligent Chinese people, are in vain.

Every citizen of our country who is somewhat knowledgeable about politics understands how long and arduous a struggle the Chinese people waged against the incompetence of their own feudal system, against foreign oppression, especially against the Japanese aggressors. The glorious Chinese Communist Party and its heroic army were born in this arduous struggle and in the brilliant light of the great October Socialist Revolution. This army carried out a mythical Long March across the vast land of China, and grew stronger in the struggle against the Japanese aggressors and Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique, finally liberating all of China. In this arduous struggle, fearless fighters and far-sighted political activists, closely linked to the people, grew up. Today, many of them are the leaders of the Chinese People's Government. They wisely control the destiny of China, and they are the guarantee of China's continued victorious development.

An unbreakable, fraternal friendship has been forged between the Czech and Chinese peoples. In recent years, many citizens, experts, artists, and ordinary workers from our country have had many opportunities to visit China. We increasingly deeply feel the spiritual connection that unites our two peoples. Although we are separated by thousands of kilometers, just as new rapid means of transportation are shortening this distance, our two peoples are also becoming increasingly understanding and close. People's China has entered the ninth year of its completely free life. Our parliamentary delegation (The Czechoslovak parliamentary delegation visited our country in the autumn of 1957. The author of this article was the head of the delegation – editor) has had the honor to learn more comprehensively about the amazing achievements that People's China has made during this period. We have seen the construction boom of modern new cities, the simple, practical, and harmonious new Chinese architecture, and the new large factories equipped with equipment made by Chinese industry itself. The entire economy of vast China, which previously belonged to the interests of foreign monopoly capital, now serves the Chinese people. China's rich natural resources have only been explored in part for the time being, but there is no doubt that China contains infinite treasures. The Chinese people will use their hard work to build a new happy future for themselves with this treasure. It is worth noting how well the Chinese leaders are at learning from the experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and wisely grasping the rhythm of China's national economic construction. They pay attention both to the coordinated development of the national economy and to the importance of heavy industry construction. At the same time, they also pay attention to gradually improving the living standards of the working people in both urban and rural areas.

China's potential strength, its prestige in the world, especially on the Asian continent, is limitless. People's China is a pioneer of peace. People's China and its wise policy of peaceful diplomacy have gained more and more friends around the world. First of all, the countries of the great socialist camp are People's China's loyal and reliable friends and allies. The socialist camp, at the Moscow meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties held not long ago to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, planned a clear path forward for itself. This is the road to building socialism, the road to peace. Our most powerful response to the hysterical "brink of war" policy of American monopoly capital is the closer unity of our ranks, better mutual exchange of experience, and better economic and cultural cooperation.

1958 will certainly not be a year of quiet rest for us. On the one hand, the current stage of socialism is increasingly posing new and major tasks for us, and on the other hand, the world tension caused by the imperialists' hysteria and frantic arms race is increasing our tasks. But if the first socialist country—the Soviet Union—was able to successfully overcome the infinite difficulties of building a new social system in the initial isolated environment and on the ruins of a land destroyed by war, then today, with the fraternal cooperation of the countries of the great socialist camp, our tasks will certainly seem easier. The Czechoslovak people are proud that the Chinese people, who have so many of the finest qualities, talents, lofty ideas, and extraordinary diligence, are also members of the great socialist family. The Chinese people are a great nation. For the first time in her long history of changes, she has found in the Chinese Communist Party a strong and wise leadership that will never disappoint her and will guide her towards a happy future. We wish the Chinese people abundant harvests in construction in the new year.

    祝中国兄弟获得新成就
    捷克斯洛伐克国民议会主席　兹·费林格
    我们对伟大中国人民的友情是久已存在的。因为长期生活在外国统治的艰苦条件下的捷克斯洛伐克人民，对像他们一样被迫为争取自己的自由而斗争的其他民族一直怀着深切的同情。中国爱国志士们早在二十世纪初就起来反对帝国主义和本国买办资产阶级与封建地主。从我们的青年时代起，中国爱国志士的艰苦斗争就一直活生生地留在我们的记忆里。那时我们整个进步公众都为欧洲列强用优势兵力野蛮镇压中国爱国志士起义的消息所深切震撼。残酷镇压的方式是自古以来欧洲列强号称符合欧洲更高文明的殖民主义政策的特点。这一政策是反对谁的呢？它是反对一个具有最古老文化的民族。这个民族的文化还在欧洲初期文明产生以前就已达到了高度水平；这个民族的文化表现在古老中国的伟大建筑中，表现在中国充满生气的造型艺术中。成为其他一切民族的文化基础的中国印刷术的产生，证明了中国人民的高度文化水平。欧洲各国帝国主义者们所渲染的种族理论，企图败坏令人喜爱的有智慧的中国人的形象是徒劳的。
    我国每一个在政治上多少有点知识的公民都了解中国人民为反对本国封建制度的无能、反对外国压迫特别是反对日本侵略者进行了多么长久和艰苦的斗争。光荣的中国共产党及其英雄的军队就是在这种艰苦的斗争中和伟大十月社会主义革命的灿烂光辉中诞生的。这支军队在中国广大的国土上进行了神话般的长征，并在反对日本侵略者和蒋介石卖国集团的斗争中成长壮大，百炼成钢，最后解放了全中国。在这场艰苦的斗争中成长出大无畏的战士和与人民紧密相联的、目光远大的政治活动家。今天他们中的许多人已是中国人民政府的领导人了。他们英明地掌握着中国的命运，他们是中国继续胜利发展的保证。
    捷中两国人民之间已经结成了牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊。最近几年来，我国的许多公民、专家、艺术家和普通工人，已有许多机会去访问中国。我们日益深切地感觉到把我们两国人民连接在一起的精神上的联系。虽然我们之间相隔着好几千公里的距离，如像新的迅速交通工具正把这个距离缩短一样，我们两国人民也日益更加了解和接近了。人民中国已进入了自己完全的自由生活的第九个年头。我们的议会代表团（捷克斯洛伐克议会代表团曾在1957年秋天访问了我国。本文作者是代表团团长——编者）已荣幸能够较详尽地了解人民中国在这一时期中所获得的令人惊奇的成就。我们看到了建设现代化新城市的建筑热潮，看到了简朴、实用、协调的中国新型建筑和以中国工业自制的设备装备起来的新的大工厂。以前从属于外国垄断资本利益的广大中国的整个经济，现在已服务于中国人民。中国丰富的自然资源暂时还只勘察了一部分，但是不容怀疑，中国蕴藏着无限的宝藏。中国人民将用自己的辛勤劳动，以这个宝藏为自己建造新的幸福未来。值得注意的是，中国领导同志们多么善于吸取苏联和其他人民民主国家的经验，英明地掌握中国国民经济建设的节奏。既注意到国民经济的协调发展，又注意到重工业建设的重要性。同时并注意到逐步提高城乡劳动人民的生活水平。
    中国的潜在力量，它在世界上特别是在亚洲大陆上的威信，是无限的。人民中国是和平的先锋战士。人民中国及其英明的和平外交政策在全世界获得了越来越多的朋友。首先，伟大的社会主义阵营各国是人民中国忠实可靠的朋友和同盟者。社会主义阵营不久前在纪念伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年时举行的各国共产党、工人党莫斯科代表会议上，为自己规划了明确的前进道路。这是建设社会主义的道路，和平的道路。我们对美国大垄断资本歇斯底里的“战争边缘”政策最有力的回答，是我们队伍更加紧密地团结一致，更好地互相交换经验，进行更好的经济文化合作。
    1958年对我们来说一定不会是平静休息的一年。一方面社会主义的现阶段日益为我们提出了新的重大任务，另一方面由于帝国主义者的歇斯底里及疯狂备战所引起的世界紧张局势，更加重了我们的任务。但是如果第一个社会主义国家——苏联在当初孤立的环境中，在为战争所毁坏的国土的废墟上尚能顺利地克服建设新社会制度的无限困难，那么在今天伟大的社会主义阵营各国兄弟般合作的情况下，我们的任务就一定显得比较容易了。捷克斯洛伐克人民感到骄傲的是，具有这么多最美好的品质、天赋的才干、崇高的思想和非凡的勤劳的中国人民，也是伟大社会主义大家庭中之一员。中国人民是一个伟大的民族，她在自己长久的变动下，在历史上第一次在中国共产党的身上找到了绝不会使她失望、引导着她走向幸福未来的坚强和英明领导。我们祝中国人民在新的一年内，在建设中取得丰盛的收获。
