(According to materials from the Fourth World Forestry Congress)
[Note] Judging from this material, China's forest area is clearly too small. In order to conserve water and soil, regulate the climate, meet the needs of industrial production and construction, and meet the needs of people's housing construction and daily furniture, we should actively and massively plant trees and forests, and accelerate the speed of greening barren mountains and greening the land.

    我国森林面积同几个国家的比较
        （据第四次世界林业会议材料）
    〔按〕从这个材料来看，我国的森林面积显然是太小了。为了保持水土、调剂气候，为了适应工业生产建设的需要，为了适应人民住宅建设和日用家具等等方面的需要，都应该积极地大量地植树造林，加快绿化荒山绿化大地的速度。
