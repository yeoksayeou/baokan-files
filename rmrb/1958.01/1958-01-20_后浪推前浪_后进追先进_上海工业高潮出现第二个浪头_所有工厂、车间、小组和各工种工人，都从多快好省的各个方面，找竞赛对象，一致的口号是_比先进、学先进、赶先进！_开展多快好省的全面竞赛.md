    The Back Waves Push the Front Waves; The Latecomers Chase the Advanced
    Shanghai Industrial Upsurge Sees Second Wave
     All factories, workshops, teams, and workers of all trades are finding competition targets from all aspects of more, faster, better, and more economical, with the consistent slogan "Compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced!" Carry out comprehensive competitions of more, faster, better and economical
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Zhongni reports: The surging new high tide of industrial production in Shanghai has a significant characteristic: almost all factories, workshops, teams, and workers of all trades are finding competition targets from all aspects of more, faster, better, and more economical, within their own factory, city, country, and even abroad, with the consistent slogan "Compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced!"
    This is a comprehensive competition of more, faster, better, and more economical. The first and most prominent wave of the new upsurge was that various famous industrial products in Shanghai sought competition targets in the quality aspect with famous brand products of Britain and the United States. Now, over a hundred and several tens of brands have found their targets and formulated struggle goals to catch up with or surpass the other party within two years, five years, or ten years. The second wave currently being set off is that factories, workshops, teams, and workers at various levels are seeking advanced targets that are more advanced than themselves in terms of output, quality, cost, and other technical and economic indicators, and are formulating competition indicators to catch up with or surpass them this year, or even in the first quarter. This wave has already spread to all walks of life. The comparison statistics of various technical and economic indicators between factories issued by the central and local competent departments are now the most popular reports. General workers and production teams are finding advanced targets to compete with within their own factory, while workshops and factories are finding advanced targets in the city or country. Newly joint ventures are finding old joint ventures and advanced state-owned factories as targets. Recently, a trend has emerged of fraternal factories visiting and learning from each other; the most noteworthy "market situation" is the newly revised competition indicators in the same type of work.
    The advanced workers who first proposed the competition initiative have encountered more and more fierce competition opponents. Yi Shijuan, a nationally famous advanced spinning female worker from the No. 2 State Cotton Mill, challenged the whole city on New Year's Day on behalf of her team, with the indicator that the work method measurement score should not be lower than 97 points, and the white spot measurement should be below 4%. Unexpectedly, the No. 5 State Cotton Mill proposed on the same day to fundamentally eliminate white spots, and Ye Huamei's team from this factory then responded to the challenge, guaranteeing that eight workers would achieve zero white spots in the first quarter. The No. 17 State Cotton Mill Huang Baomei team's challenge condition was that the work method measurement score would reach 98 points. A few days ago, Yi Shijuan's team hurriedly held a meeting and also sent more than ten people to the No. 5 State Cotton Mill to visit Ye Huamei's team, and found that the opponent was more advanced than themselves in many aspects, and their doffing workers also helped the roving workers to insert roving. Now, Yi Shijuan's team has revised the indicators, the work method measurement is 98 points, and the white spot measurement is reduced to below 2%. The competition between female textile workers and workers and teams of other trades is developing in this situation. The competition conditions proposed by the municipal advanced producer Lao Asan's team of the second workshop of the Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 5, which were much more advanced than the administrative targets, were broken through in the competition by the originally most backward third team in the workshop in just a few days. Eighty percent of the factory's production teams have now set competition indicators. The Zhengtai Rubber Factory, which proposed to catch up with the quality of British Dunlop tires one year earlier than the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, has further analyzed and compared the various indicators of fraternal factories in the past few days. They found that the Xinhua Rubber Factory used 23 cm of cotton flannel for each pair of rubber shoes, saving 6 cm compared to their factory. If they catch up with this level, they can save more than 60,000 yuan a year; Dafu Rubber Factory workers average 700 pairs of shoe lining cloth per person per eight hours, while their factory averages only 450 pairs; cadres in the financial department also found that the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, with roughly the same total output value, had less than 5 million yuan in working capital, while their factory needed more than 6 million yuan. After comparisons in various aspects, the Zhengtai Factory is sending people to learn advanced experience in all directions and formulating measures to catch up with fraternal factories in these aspects.
    The wave of "compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced" has sent a warning to a batch of original advanced factories: do not be complacent! The No. 2 State Cotton Mill, which used to be among the best in some main indicators, recently found after checking the indicators of various factories that the quality of 21-count yarn, which had always been the first in the city, had dropped to fourth place, and the quality of 42-count cone yarn had dropped to the last place among eleven state-owned factories. After this situation was announced at the workers' representative meeting held a few days ago, the whole factory was in an uproar. Now, technical and management personnel have started layer-by-layer inspections, mobilizing workers to think of ways and formulate measures. Among the joint state-private enterprises, Anda No. 1 Factory, which had won the title of excellent factory for six consecutive quarters, recently proposed a new goal to overcome the complacency and conservatism of some employees: to catch up with the level of No. 1 State Cotton Mill within one year.
    The industrial leadership department in Shanghai, in organizing the new production upsurge, has paid attention to comparing the gap between the advanced and the backward in all aspects of more, faster, better, and more economical. The "compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced" wave that has been set off can tap into huge potential for increasing production and saving. Now, various departments are holding and preparing exhibitions to compare the advanced and the backward and introduce advanced experiences to further promote this wave. At the same time, an anti-waste campaign lasting about half a month will be launched in the city, which will be another new wave with great impetus in this year's new production upsurge.

    后浪推前浪　后进追先进
    上海工业高潮出现第二个浪头
     所有工厂、车间、小组和各工种工人，都从多快好省的各个方面，找竞赛对象，一致的口号是“比先进、学先进、赶先进！”开展多快好省的全面竞赛
    据新华社上海19日电　新华社记者徐中尼报道：奔腾前进的上海工业生产新高潮，有一个显著的特点：几乎所有工厂、车间、小组和各工种工人，都从多、快、好、省的各方面，在本厂、本市、国内甚至国外找竞赛对象，一致的口号是“比先进、学先进、赶先进”！
    这是多、快、好、省的全面竞赛。新高潮的第一个最突出的浪头，是上海各种著名的工业产品在质量方面寻找与英美等国名牌产品竞赛的对象，现在已经有一百几十种牌号的产品找到了对象，制订了两年或五年、十年等时间内赶上或超过对方的奋斗目标。目前正在掀起的第二个浪头，是处在各种不同水平的工厂、车间、小组和工人，在产量、质量、成本等各项技术经济指标方面，寻找比自己先进的对象，制订在今年甚至是第一季度内就要赶上或超过的竞赛指标。这个浪头已经波及各行各业，中央和地方主管部门颁发的各厂间各项技术经济指标的对比统计，现在是最受欢迎的报表。一般的工人和生产小组，都在本厂找先进的对象竞赛，车间、工厂则在本市或国内找先进的对象，新合营厂则找老合营和国营先进厂作对象。最近出现一种风气，是兄弟厂之间相互查访、学习；最受人注意的“行情”，是同工种中新修订的竞赛指标。
    最先提出竞赛倡议的先进工人，遇到了愈来愈多的激烈的竞赛对手。国棉二厂全国著名的先进纺纱女工裔式娟，在元旦代表她的小组向全市挑战，指标是工作法测定分数不低于九十七分，测定白点在4％以下。不料当天国棉五厂提出要根本消灭白点，这个厂的叶华美小组接着应战，保证在第一季度就有八个工人做到无白点。国棉十七厂黄宝妹小组的应战条件是工作法测定分数达到九十八分。几天前，裔式娟小组急忙开会，还派了十多人赶到国棉五厂去访问叶华美小组，发现对手有不少地方比自己先进，他们的落纱工也帮挡车工镶粗纱。现在裔式娟小组已经修订了指标，工作法测定是九十八分，测定白点降到2％以下。纺织女工和其他工种工人和小组的竞赛，正在这种情势中发展。上海卷烟五厂第二车间的市级先进生产者劳阿三的小组提出的比行政下达的指标先进得多的竞赛条件，只过几天，就被本车间原来最落后的第三小组在竞赛中突破了。这个厂80％的生产小组现在都订出了竞赛指标。提出了比大中华橡胶厂早一年赶上英国邓禄普轮胎质量的正泰橡胶厂，这几天又进一步分析对比了兄弟厂的各项指标。他们发现：新华橡胶厂每双胶鞋用棉毛布二十三公分，比本厂节省六公分，如果赶上这个水平，一年可以节约六万多元；大孚橡胶厂工人上套鞋里子布平均每人每八小时上七百双，本厂平均只上四百五十双；财务部门的干部也查访到生产总值大致相等的大中华橡胶厂，流动资金不到五百万元，而本厂需六百多万元。经过各方面的对比，正泰厂正在派人四出学习先进经验，并制订在这些方面赶上兄弟厂的措施。
    “比先进、学先进、赶先进”的浪头，向一批原来的先进厂发出警号：不能自满！原来在一些主要指标方面名列前茅的国棉二厂，最近查对了各厂的指标后发现，一向是全市第一名的二十一支纱质量，已经降到第四名，四十二支筒子纱的质量，已经降到十一个国营厂的最末一名。这个情况在几天前召开的职工代表大会上宣布了以后，全厂哗然。现在技术和管理人员开始了层层检查，发动职工想办法、订措施。在公私合营厂中，曾经连续六个季度获得优胜厂称号的安达一厂，为了克服部分职工的自满保守情绪，最近提出了新的奋斗目标：决心在一年内赶上国棉一厂的水平。
    上海的工业领导部门在组织新的生产高潮中，注意到从多、快、好、省的各方面对比先进和落后的差距，目前已经掀起的“比先进、学先进、赶先进”的浪潮，可以挖掘出十分巨大的增产节约潜力。现在，各部门都在举办和筹备对比先进和落后、介绍先进经验的展览会，进一步推动这个浪潮；与此同时，一个为期约半个月的反浪费运动将要紧接着在全市展开，这将是今年新的生产高潮中又一个具有巨大推动力的新浪头。
