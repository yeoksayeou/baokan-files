    Winter Scenery of Hometown
    By Our Correspondent Lin Wei
    In my memory, the people of Qin County, Shanxi, my hometown, never engaged in water conservancy. Except for a few small vegetable gardens that used well water to irrigate vegetables, it was 100% dry land. The reason for not engaging in water conservancy was not because of abundant rain; in most years, there was a shortage of rain. When there was a shortage of rain, people would put willow branches on their heads and pray for rain at the Dragon King Temple, but no one ever advocated building canals, reservoirs, or other water conservancy projects, as if it were utterly impossible. "Heaven arranged for us to plant dry land, so we must plant dry land." This was the general view of the people. One year after liberation, when I returned home and talked with some neighbors, it was said that the "water is hard and the soil is soft" here, and water would ruin the land if irrigated. Most of Qin County is hilly, with many gullies and slopes, and little flat land that is scattered, which also created the impression that it was "not suitable for irrigation." Many rivers and ditches had clear water, but there was very little of it. People only used them to water livestock and wash clothes, and did not think they would have any other use. In winter, hauling coal and firewood, celebrating the New Year, visiting relatives, or going to other villages to see operas and fairs, the rivers and ditches were filled with mud, which added some trouble. Therefore, I never thought that Qin County could do anything in terms of water conservancy.
    However, what I have seen and heard during my recent return home has fundamentally changed my impression. As a result of agricultural cooperation, many "abnormal" phenomena have appeared. Qin County's "nothing can be done" in water conservancy construction has now become "much can be done." Let's start with the "Yingchun" (Welcoming Spring) Reservoir.
    "Yingchun" Reservoir and its Psychological Impact
    Southeast of Duancun, my hometown, there is a small river called Yingchun River. Like other small rivers in Qin County, there is usually very little clear water and a muddy mess. In winter, there is some river ice for children to play "ice sliding." People only knew that some cultivated land along the river was more drought-resistant, but they never used the river water to irrigate the land. After the joint efforts of dozens of agricultural cooperatives in the first half of 1957, under the leadership of the county party committee, a solid dam 200 meters long and 12 meters high was built here to block the river, as well as an intake gate and a flood discharge project. In the depression between the mountain ridge in the north and the large highlands of Fucunping in the south, a reservoir capable of storing 3 million cubic meters of water and irrigating 10,000 mu of land appeared, named the "Yingchun" Reservoir. It is said to be the best-quality reservoir built in Shanxi Province in 1957. This reservoir collects the constant clear streams of the Yingchun River and the summer floods, turning it into a considerable "lake." The day the lake was completed coincided with a severe drought in Qin County during the hottest days of summer, with no rain for forty days. Some elderly people in some villages were already secretly kowtowing to the Dragon King, hiding it from the "work team." The Yingchun Reservoir, built in time, opened the intake gate at the most critical moment, and the surging lake water flowed from west to east along a ten-mile-long main canal, saving the cultivated land of more than a dozen agricultural societies along the canal. Due to the insufficient number of branch canals and field canals, and the unevenness of the cultivated land, less than 10,000 mu were irrigated in the summer of 1957, only 5,000 mu. However, the irrigated crops proved with their lush branches and full grains that the soil and water in Qin County were not significantly different from those elsewhere. The so-called "hard water and soft soil," and "water can ruin the land" lost their control over the peasants from then on. The small streams that had no status in people's minds in the past have now been proven by facts to be able to "do great things." As long as people build dams and irrigation canals, the dry land arranged by God can be turned into irrigated land.
    The psychological impact of this reservoir on the 120,000 farmers in Qin County far exceeds its direct economic value. Now, on the intake gate built of neat large stone blocks, facing the winter sun, the four large characters "Man Will Conquer Nature" carved in stone appear particularly proud and clear. They declare to all passers-by the victory of man over nature, and the arrival of an era in which farmers control their own destiny. Mr. Wei Ying, an old scholar from my village, also wrote a seven-character quatrain for the reservoir, which is also carved here, two lines of which are aimed at the Yingchun River water: "In the past, it caused harm, but now it brings blessings; since ancient times, it depends on people, not on heaven."
    According to comrades from the county party committee, Qin County only had about 1,800 mu of irrigated land before liberation. There was some development after liberation, but by 1955, the total was less than 5,000 mu, only 1% of the county's 500,000 mu of cultivated land. However, in just two years after cooperation, the irrigated land has increased to 36,000 mu. This number is still very small, but it is equivalent to twenty times that before liberation, and more than seven times that before cooperation.
    "Block the Zhang River, no water leaves the county!"
    This is just the beginning. During the second five-year plan, Qin County's water conservancy construction plan is even more ambitious and heroic. The core of this plan is a heroic slogan that is now resounding throughout the county, called "Block the Zhang River, no water leaves the county!" This is not just empty talk, it has completely practical action steps that have been appraised by experts. Qin County has five large rivers (actually just larger small rivers), 214 small rivers, and 72 springs scattered throughout the territory, all of which flow into the Turbid Zhang River. The source of the Turbid Zhang River is in the northern part of Qin County. In response to this geographical characteristic, Qin County's water conservancy construction steps are to first cut off the tributaries of the Zhang River, and then cut off the source of the Zhang River. The method of cutting off all rivers is to build reservoirs and canals everywhere. In the words of the county party committee, it is to build "grape-like reservoir clusters," "spider web-like irrigation canals," plus "honeycomb-like transverse river wells." The planned reservoirs number more than 200, the larger branch canals number 1,200, there are 160 terraced field high irrigation sites, and more than 1,600 large drought wells and transverse river wells. This plan looks big, but it actually uses very little money, because most of it is run by the masses themselves, except for a few relatively large projects. If these plans are realized, Qin County's irrigated land can increase to 220,000 mu or even more. It can also reclaim tens of thousands of mu of river channels into fertile paddy fields for planting rice. Reservoir clusters can greatly raise fish and ducks, increasing income for farmers. Small hydropower stations will also gradually increase. Trees will be planted extensively around the water, rapidly greening the area. The poor Qin County, which suffers from drought nine years out of ten, will become a prosperous land of fish and rice that is not afraid of floods and droughts. By then, the fate that the old God arranged for the farmers of Qin County in the past will be fundamentally denied.
    Such a plan might have been seen as a pipe dream before agricultural cooperation. But after agricultural cooperation, especially after the successful construction of the "Yingchun" Reservoir in 1957, people regarded this plan as a matter of course. If the Yingchun River can be blocked, why can't the Gulu River, the Xuyang River, the Baiyu River, and the Xi River, which are about the same size, be blocked? With all the tributaries blocked, only the source of the Zhang River remains, which is not much bigger than other rivers. What other difficulties cannot be overcome?
    Treating Night as Day
    Near Fancun, more than ten miles south of the city, a new reservoir—the Gulu River Reservoir—is being built at an accelerated pace. Compared with the "Yingchun" Reservoir, this reservoir has four times the workload and irrigates 20,000 mu of land. People's enthusiasm is even greater. When the reporter visited the construction site in early December, thousands of migrant workers on the dam were divided into day and night shifts, busily digging up the mud and rocks in the riverbed, preparing to build a cut-off wall. Two water pumps were constantly roaring, pumping out more and more groundwater. Many migrant workers had their legs half-submerged in the water, but they were talking and laughing without a care. At night, the generator started up, and electric lights illuminated the construction site brightly. Ice constantly formed on shovels, picks, and dirt baskets. People heated them on the boiler's furnace and then continued to work. The biting northwest wind in the winter night could not threaten the migrant workers whose bodies were radiating heat. Their slogan is: "Treat the night as day, electric lights as the sun, no stopping work when the ground is frozen, no withdrawing troops when it snows."
    Surrounding this reservoir, ten-mile-long main canals are being actively built on the north and south sides. There are also thousands of migrant workers operating intensively here. Some are splitting cliffs, and some are filling gullies. They want to make a big change to the terrain that their ancestors left behind, which was "always like this," according to their own wishes. They are conducting a friendly competition with the workers who are driving heavy road rollers to help compact the soil.
    Individually larger projects can only be regarded as a banner in the entire movement; under the banner is a surging wave of the masses building water conservancy. This wave has almost swept into all the large and small villages and advanced and backward farmers in Qin County.
    In the Chengxi area, which is very familiar with all the mountains, rivers, and villages, I visited many relatives and friends' homes and many villages. In the past, there were very few people in the fields of these villages in winter. Most people went to the western mountains to collect firewood, or drove ox carts to Xiangyuan or Qinyuan County to haul coal for the winter, and accumulated fuel for the spring, summer, and autumn seasons of the following year. Now, only a few people are engaged in firewood and charcoal. Groups of agricultural cooperative members, including elderly people in their sixties and seventies and primary school students in their teens, men and women, are building water conservancy projects of various sizes everywhere. Like construction workers, the sound of "heave-ho" resounds through the fields, which is the sound of migrant workers tamping the earth. Mr. Wei Ying, whom I mentioned earlier, is in his sixties and is still enthusiastically carrying soil and building dams with the young people. At night, many villages light up their kerosene lamps to work overtime, hoping to complete some projects before the ground is completely frozen. The lights of each village in the fields can be seen from afar, it is truly treating the night as day, lively and extraordinary. The seven villages under the jurisdiction of Duancun Township, my hometown, are all taking action: Rensheng Village is building a backflow canal from the "Yingchun" Reservoir, wanting the water to return from east to west; Dongpo Village is building a high irrigation project; Duancun is building a small reservoir north of the village; Yuanwang Village and Shangwan Village are jointly opening a clear water canal. Xiaozhuangzi on the western hillside is building a gully dam to conserve water and soil. In the high mountains several miles west of Duancun, a group of cooperative members dug out gurgling spring water under a large mountain rock; people are continuing to dig, wanting to make the water source larger. Even without counting this spring water, Duancun Township will increase 2,800 mu of irrigated land after winter repairs, which is equal to one-fifth of the township's cultivated land. This is not much. Yangzhuang Township, north of Duancun Township, is building two reservoirs and several canals, wanting to turn a quarter of the township's cultivated land into irrigated land. Guo Village Township, south of Duancun Township, has a total of 20,000 mu of cultivated land, and the projects currently under construction will turn 7,000 mu (one-third) of them into irrigated land. Nanchen Township, east of the "Yingchun" Reservoir, newly irrigated 7,000 mu of land in 1957, and now wants to build another 4,000 mu. They will turn half of the more than 20,000 mu of cultivated land into irrigated land....
    The county's original plan for 1958 was to increase irrigated land by 54,000 mu. But now, adding together the current year's plans that each township has automatically reported to the county, the clear water irrigated land alone is 76,000 mu (not counting the 80,000 mu of flood-irrigated land). In this way, adding the existing irrigated land, the total will not be the originally planned 90,000 mu, but 112,000 mu. This means that the farmers of Qin County will each have an average of one mu of irrigated land. When the broad masses consciously and voluntarily take action, the power is so great and the speed is so fast that it is truly unimaginable!
    On the eve of the reporter's recent departure from Qin County, the Changzhi Prefectural Commissioner's Office had approved Qin County to start construction of the Xuyang River and Baiyu River Reservoirs ahead of schedule. These are two more projects, each irrigating more than 10,000 mu of land, which the masses urgently demand. If it is not spread over the years, the total amount of irrigated land in Qin County may reach 144,000 mu in 1958! How could this be imagined in the old days?
    "Block the Zhang River, no water leaves the county!" This heroic and magnificent plan has now been put on the agenda for 1959. The Zhang River, which used to look so huge and terrifying to people, will become wealth that people can freely control and use in our hands!
    People always feel particularly close and excited about the changes in their hometown. Thinking of the hopeful present and the infinitely beautiful future, I feel very sorry for the dead ancestors, especially for the people who starved to death in large numbers in the third year of Guangxu. How much better it would have been if they had been born a few years later!

    故乡冬景
    本报记者　林韦
    在我的记忆里，我的故乡山西沁县的人们是从来不搞水利的。除了寥若晨星的一些小菜园用井水浇菜外，百分之百都是旱地。不搞水利并不是因为雨多，这里多数的年头是缺雨的。缺雨的时候，人们就把柳条盘在头上到龙王庙祈雨，但却从来没有人提倡过兴修水渠、水库或其他水利工程，好像这是根本没有任何可能的。“老天爷安排咱们种旱地，就得种旱地。”这是人们的一般看法。解放以后有一年回家，同一些邻家谈起来，据说这里“水硬土软”，水能把地浇坏。沁县大部地区是丘陵地，沟坡很多，平地较少而且分散，这种地理条件也造成“不适于灌溉”的印象。许多河沟有清水，但都很少，人们只是用它们饮牲畜、洗衣服，并不以为它们会有别的用处。冬季拉煤打柴，过大年跑亲戚，或者到外村看戏赶会的时候，河沟里一片稀泥，还给人添些麻烦。因此，我从来没有想到沁县在水利方面会有什么可为。
    但是，最近期间返乡的所见所闻，却使我的印象从根本上改变了。农业合作化的结果，许多方面都出现了“反常”现象，沁县在水利建设方面的“无所可为”，现在也变成了“大有可为”。这里先从“迎春”水库谈起。
    “迎春”水库及其心理影响
    在我的家乡端村东南，有一条小河叫迎春河。和沁县的其他小河一样，这里平时只有很少的清水和一片泥泞。冬天有一些河冰供孩子们打“驰溜”。人们从来只知道河边有一些耕地比较耐旱，却从来不利用河水浇地。经过1957年前半年几十个农业合作社的共同努力，在县委的领导下，这里筑起了二百公尺长、十二公尺高的坚固的拦河坝，筑起了进水闸和溢洪工程。在北面的山岗和南面的福村坪大片高地之间的山洼里，就出现了一个能蓄水三百万方、浇地一万亩的水库，名“迎春”水库。据说这是山西各地1957年所建水库中质量最好的水库。这水库把迎春河长年不断的清水溪流和夏日的洪水汇集在一起，成了很可观的一个“湖”。湖成之日，正值伏天沁县大旱，四十天不落雨，有些村的老年人已经在瞒着“工作组”给龙王爷磕头。应时筑成的迎春水库，在最危急的时候打开了进水闸，汹涌的湖水沿着十多里长的干渠由西向东流去，拯救了渠边十多个农业社的耕地。由于支渠毛渠不敷所需，耕地不够平整，1957年夏季并未浇足一万亩，只浇了五千亩。但是，浇过的庄稼以茁壮的枝叶和饱满的颗粒证明了沁县的水土和别处的水土并没有重大的区别，所谓“水硬土软”、“水能把地浇坏”的说法，从此失去了对农民的控制力量。从前在人们心目中毫无地位的小溪流，现在也由事实证明是能够“办大事”的了。只要人们修上拦河坝和引水渠，老天爷安排下的旱地就能够变成水地。
    这个水库在沁县十二万农民中所产生的心理影响，远超过它的直接经济价值。现在，在整齐的大石条砌成的进水闸上，迎着冬日的朝阳，石刻的“人定胜天”四个大字显得分外骄傲而鲜明。它们向所有过往的人们宣扬着人对自然的胜利，宣扬着农民掌握自己命运的时代的到来。我村一位老秀才卫瑛先生为水库所提的一首七绝也刻在这里，其中有两句针对迎春河水说：“昔日作威今作福，自古在人不在天。”
    据县委同志们谈，沁县在解放以前只有一千八百来亩水浇地。解放以后有了发展；但到1955年为止，总数不足五千亩，只占全县五十万亩耕地的百分之一。而合作化以后不过二年，水浇地已经增加到三万六千亩。这数目仍然很小，但它相当于解放以前二十倍，合作化以前七倍多。
    “拦断漳河，水不出县！”
    这只是事情的开始。在第二个五年计划期间，沁县的水利建设计划是更加宏伟而富有英雄气魄的。这个计划的中心是现在响遍全县的一句英雄口号，叫做“拦断漳河，水不出县！”这不是一句空话，它有着完全切实的、经专家鉴定过的行动步骤。沁县有五条大河（实际上只是较大的小河）、二百十四条小河和七十二处泉水密布全境，条条河流都汇入浊漳河。浊漳河的源头就在沁县北境。针对这种地理特点，沁县的修水利步骤是先断漳河支流，后切漳河源头。切断所有河流的方法，就是到处修筑水库和水渠。用县委的话说，是修筑“葡萄式的水库群”，“蛛纲式的灌溉渠”，还要加上“蜂窝式的透河井”。计划中的水库有二百多处，较大的支干渠有一千二百条，台田高灌一百六十处，大型的旱井和透河井一千六百多眼。这计划看去很大，实际用钱很少，因为除过少数比较大的工程外，大部分都是群众自办。这些计划实现了，沁县的水浇地就可以增长到二十二万亩以至更多。还可以把空出来的好几万亩河槽开辟成肥沃的水田，用以种稻。水库群可以大养鱼鸭，为农民增加收入。小型水电站也将逐渐增多。水周围将普遍植树，迅速绿化。十年九旱的贫困的沁县，将变为不怕洪旱灾害的富裕的鱼米之乡。到那时，过去老天爷给沁县农民安排定的命运，将被根本否定。
    这样的计划，在农业合作化以前可能会被人们看作痴人说梦。但是在农业合作化以后，尤其1957年修筑“迎春”水库成功以后，人们就把这计划看成当然的继续。迎春河能够拦断，圪芦河、徐扬河、白玉河、西河这些大小相差不多的河流为什么不能拦断？支流都断了，剩下一个漳源头，也比别的河大不了多少，还有什么困难不能克服呢？
    黑夜当白天
    在城南十多里的樊村附近，一个新的水库——圪芦河水库正在加紧施工。这个水库同“迎春”水库相比，工程量大四倍，浇地二万亩。人们的兴头也更大。12月上旬记者到工地参观的时候，大坝上有上千的民工正分为日夜两班，忙碌地挖掘着河道里的稀泥乱石，准备修筑截水墙。两架抽水机在不断头地鸣响，把越来越多的地下水抽掉。许多民工都把半截腿浸在水里，但他们满不在乎地谈笑着。夜里，发电机旋转起来，电灯把工地照得雪亮。锨钁上和土筐里不断地结冰，人们到锅驼机的火炉上烘热一下就又继续劳动。冬夜里凛冽的西北风，不能使全身发散着热气的民工们感到威胁。他们的口号是：“黑夜当白天，电灯当太阳，地冻不停工，下雪不收兵。”
    围绕着这个水库，南北两面都在积极修筑十多里长的干渠。这里也有上千的民工在紧张地操作。他们有的在劈崖，有的在垫沟。他们要依照自己的意愿，把祖宗们遗留下来的“从来如此”的地势来个大改变。他们正在同开动着沉重的压路机帮忙压土的工人们进行友谊的竞赛。
    个别比较大的工程，在整个运动中只能算是一面大旗；大旗下面是风起云涌的广大群众兴修水利的浪潮。这浪潮几乎把沁县一切大的小的村庄和先进后进的农民都卷进来了。
    在一切山水村庄都非常熟悉的城西地区，我跑了许多亲戚朋友家，跑了许多村庄。这些村庄的田野上，过去在冬季是很少有人迹的，人们多半跑到西山去打柴，或者赶着牛车到襄垣或沁源县去拉煤过冬，并积聚下年春夏秋三季的燃料。现在却只有少数人在搞柴炭。成群结队的农业社员，包括六七十岁的老年人和十六七岁的小学生，男的女的，这里一伙，那里一堆，到处都在修筑着一些或大或小的水利工程。像建筑工人一样，杭育杭育的喊声震撼着田野，这是民工们在打硪。前面说到的卫瑛老先生，六十多岁了，还兴致勃勃地同年青人一道担土筑坝。夜里，许多村庄都点着马灯加班，希望在大地完全冻实以前修完一些工程。田野里各村灯火相望，真是黑夜当白天，热闹非凡。我的家乡端村乡所辖七个村庄，统统都在行动：仁胜村在从“迎春”水库修筑倒灌渠，要水从东往西返；东坡村在修高灌工程；端村在村北修一个小水库；元王村和上湾村在联合开一条清水渠。西山坡上的小庄子，在修谷坊土坝保持水土。在端村西面好几里的高山里，一群社员在一块大山石下挖出了潺潺的泉水；人们继续挖掘着，想使水源再大一些。即使不计算这股泉水，端村乡经过冬修也将增加二千八百亩水地，这数目等于全乡耕地五分之一。这并不算多的。端村乡北面的羊庄乡，正在修筑两个水库和若干水渠，要把全乡四分之一的耕地变成水地。端村乡南面的郭村乡一共有二万亩耕地，现在正在修筑的工程将把其中七千亩（即三分之一）变为水浇地。在“迎春”水库东面的南陈乡，1957年新灌地七千亩，现在要再修四千亩，他们将使二万多亩耕地的一半变为水浇地……。
    1958年全县原定计划是增修水地五万四千亩。但现在把各乡自动报到县里的本年计划加在一起，仅清水浇地就是七万六千亩（八万亩洪水浇地不计）。这样，加上已有的水地，总数将不是原来计划的九万亩，而是十一万二千亩了。这就是说，沁县农民将要每人平均有一亩水地了。在广大群众自觉自愿地行动起来的时候，力量之大，速度之快，实在是人们难以想像的！
    在记者最近离开沁县的前夕，长治专署已经批准沁县提前开工兴建徐扬河和白玉河水库。这又是两个各浇地一万多亩的工程，是群众所迫切要求的。如果不跨年度的话，1958年沁县水浇地总数可能达到十四万四千亩！这在旧时代怎能想像？
    “拦断漳河、水不出县！”这个英雄的气壮山河的规划，现在已经提到1959年的议程上来了。过去人们看起来那么巨大而可怕的漳河，在我们手里就要变成人们可以自由支配和使用的财富了！
    人们对于自己故乡的变化总是特别感到亲切和兴奋的。想到充满希望的现在和无限美好的将来，我很为死去的先人们抱屈，尤其为光绪三年大量饿死的人们抱屈。他们如果晚生些年，该有多好啊！
