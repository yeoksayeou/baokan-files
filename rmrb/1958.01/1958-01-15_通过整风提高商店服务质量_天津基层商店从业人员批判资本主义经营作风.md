　　Improving Shop Service Quality Through Rectification
　　Tianjin Grassroots Shop Employees Criticize Capitalist Management Styles

　　(Our Dispatch) According to the Tianjin Daily: More than 13,000 grassroots units such as shops and warehouses in the Tianjin financial and trade system are successively carrying out rectification and socialist education movements. More than 120,000 people, including salespersons, service personnel, administrative staff, workers, private partners, and vendors, are participating in this movement. In the midst of extensive airing of views and debates, these employees have put forward more than 500,000 suggestions regarding the service quality, business management, and leadership styles of enterprises.

　　The leadership of these units, based on the characteristics of dispersed shops, warehouses, and processing factories, as well as varying levels of personnel, adopted various forms such as group meetings, symposiums, big-character posters, reception stations, written opinions, and individual interviews to mobilize the masses to air their views and conduct debates extensively.

　　During the airing of views, many shop employees exposed the capitalist management styles of general stores and grassroots shops, and put forward sharp criticisms of deceptive behaviors such as shorting weights and measures and substituting inferior goods for better ones. Among the more than 50,000 opinions put forward by staff members in the Hebei District non-staple food industry, more than 12,000 belonged to business management. Wang Baohua of the Hebei District Non-Staple Food Retail Company criticized the public-private joint venture Shuangji store for giving short weight when selling brown sugar. According to regulations, every two pounds of brown sugar should be divided into eleven small packages, each package costing 10 cents, but this store actually packaged one pound of brown sugar into eleven packages, each still selling for 10 cents. Guo Zhonghong of the Third Beef and Mutton General Store revealed that the price of lamb offal was 22 cents per pound, but in order to gain more profit, the general store actually took out the lamb liver to sell separately at a high price, and the rest was still sold at the original price. Wu Shaoting, a salesperson at the public-private joint venture Zhensheng Grocery Store, revealed that the public-private joint venture Yongxingju Pickle Shop only cared about making money and disregarded the health of customers, even mixing rotten tomatoes into the chili sauce when making it. In addition, many employees also put forward many opinions on the rude service attitude of the shops and the low quality of goods.

　　Many employees criticized the bureaucratic work style of some leading departments and exposed the chaotic business management and the phenomena of property loss and waste in enterprises. For example, staff members of the Tianjin Grain Storage and Transportation Company's Third Warehouse revealed that this warehouse received 120,000 catties of grain with high moisture content in the third quarter of last year. The warehouse leaders did not take timely measures to reduce the moisture, resulting in most of it becoming moldy and deteriorating, and being sold at a reduced price, resulting in a loss of more than 600 yuan.

　　Many units, in accordance with the spirit of "rectifying and correcting simultaneously," have already begun to improve their work based on the opinions of the masses. The Xinhua District Coal Industry General Store, based on the opinions of the masses that the coal delivery of the stores was not timely, there was too much fine coal in the machine-made coal balls, and there were many stones mixed in the lump coal, unified the deployment of the transportation capacity of each store, overcoming the phenomenon of uneven workload, and screened the coal balls before delivery, picking out the stones in the coal lumps. After taking the above measures, the phenomenon of untimely coal delivery has been reduced, and the quality of coal has also been improved, which has been welcomed by the masses.

    通过整风提高商店服务质量
    天津基层商店从业人员批判资本主义经营作风
    本报讯　据天津日报报道：天津市财贸系统一万三千多个商店、仓库等基层单位正在陆续开展整风和社会主义教育运动。参加这一运动的有售货员、服务员、行政管理人员、工人、私方人员和摊贩共十二万多人。这些从业人员在大鸣大放中对企业的服务质量、经营管理、领导作风等，提出了五十多万条意见。
    这些单位的领导方面根据商店、仓库、加工厂地址分散、人员水平不一等特点，采用小组会、座谈会、大字报、接待站、意见书、个别访问等多种形式，发动群众大鸣大放。
    在鸣放中，许多商店的从业人员揭发了总店、基层商店的资本主义经营作风，对于短斤少两、以次顶好等欺骗顾客的行为提出了尖锐的批评。河北区副食品行业工作人员提出的五万多条意见中，属于经营作风方面的有一万二千多条。河北区副食品零售公司王宝华批评公私合营双记门市部卖红糖少给斤两，按规定，每二斤红糖分包十一小包，每包一角，但是这个门市部竟将一斤红糖包了十一包，每包仍卖一角钱。第三牛羊肉总店郭中洪揭发，羊下水每斤卖价两角二分，总店为多获利润，竟把羊肝剔出去单独卖高价，其余的仍按原价卖。公私合营振声杂货店售货员吴绍亭，揭发公私合营永兴居酱菜铺只图赚钱，不顾顾客健康，做辣子酱的时候竟将烂西红柿掺在里面。另外，许多职工对于商店的服务态度生硬、货品质量低等也提出不少意见。
    许多职工对某些领导部门的官僚主义作风提出了批评，并揭发了企业经营管理混乱、财产损失浪费的现象。例如天津市粮食储运公司第三仓库工作人员揭发，这个仓库在去年第三季度接收十二万斤含水分较大的谷子，仓库领导人员没有及时采取措施降低水分，以致大部霉坏变质，贬价出售，损失六百余元。
    不少单位按照“边整边改”的精神，已经着手根据群众意见改进工作。新华区煤业总店，根据群众提出的门市部送煤不及时、机器煤球末多、块煤里混着许多石块等意见，统一调配了各门市部的运输力，克服了忙闲不均的现象，并且在送煤以前将煤球过筛，挑出煤块里的石头。采取以上措施以后，送煤不及时的现象减少了，煤的质量也有提高，受到群众的欢迎。
