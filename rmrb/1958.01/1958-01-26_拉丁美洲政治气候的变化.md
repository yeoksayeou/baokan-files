A comprehensive report from this newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency, as the overall world situation develops in a direction favorable to peace, the political climate of Latin America, known as the backyard of the United States, cannot but be widely affected. As previously reported, the patriotic guerrillas in Cuba are persisting in their struggle and their strength is growing; the people of Venezuela have risen up and overthrown the reactionary rule of the tyrant Jiménez... News that is quite a headache for the ruling group in the United States is constantly coming from other Latin American countries:

    Oppose the merger of the Organization of American States with the Atlantic Group

    Buenos Aires dispatch: The Argentine Peace Committee issued a statement resolutely denouncing the plan to merge the Organization of American States with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The statement pointed out that this plan was proposed by the U.S. State Department and that it "is a threat to the peace, tranquility, and sovereignty of Latin American countries," and that it would drag Argentina into military adventures.

    The Argentine Peace Committee emphasized that it is the duty of every Argentine to resolutely oppose the implementation of this plan, which would lead to national destruction.

    Montevideo dispatch: The Uruguayan "People's News" recently published a statement from the Guatemalan "Patriotic Front" opposing the merger of the Organization of American States with the North Atlantic military group. The statement emphasized that the real purpose of attempting to merge these two organizations is to suppress the national liberation struggles of the people of these countries.

    Advocate Developing Trade Relations with Socialist Countries

    New York dispatch: Associated Press reporter Alman reported that Latin American countries, which are mired in economic difficulties, are clamoring to trade with socialist countries.

    The reporter wrote: In Brazil, a huge voice in favor of trade with the Soviet Union can be heard. Brazilian public opinion is worried that a severe economic recession may be caused by the decline in coffee prices, so it hopes to negotiate trade with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's willingness to provide Brazil with petroleum equipment and technical assistance is greatly welcomed by the Brazilian people. In Chile, although Chile does not have formal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, Chileans hope to strengthen trade and cultural relations with the Soviet Union. The continuous decline in copper prices is one of the reasons that prompted Chile to trade with socialist countries. Income from copper exports accounts for more than 60% of Chile's budget, and the decline in copper prices has caused severe economic tension.

    Alman said that Argentina has sent a trade delegation to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. Argentina particularly needs equipment for the petroleum industry, and it hopes to obtain this equipment from the Soviet Union.

    He also said that in Uruguay, the country has been severely hit because the United States began subsidizing domestic wool producers, which greatly reduced Uruguay's wool exports to the United States. Now it also hopes to trade with the Soviet Union.

    Colombia is currently negotiating with a Soviet trade delegation in the capital, Bogota.

    The Struggle Between Democratic Forces and Pro-American Forces

    Buenos Aires dispatch: The Chilean Socialist Party held a central plenary session in Santiago to discuss the party's political line and preparations for the presidential election. According to newspaper reports, the plenary session emphasized that the political goal of the Socialist Party is to: realize the program of the Popular Action Front. The plenary session pointed out that the Popular Action Front is "a tool for politically leading the masses of working people to fight for the unity of their ranks," and the Socialist Party will fight to strengthen the Popular Action Front. The participants particularly emphasized that Chilean socialists and communists have gained mutual understanding in the common struggle to realize the aspirations of the Chilean people, which is of great significance. The plenary session pointed out that the Socialist Party adopts an irreconcilable attitude towards the Ibáñez government, which is supported by reactionary forces at home and abroad. Condemning the attempt by imperialist monopoly organizations to reduce Chilean copper production.

    Guatemala City dispatch: The preliminary results of the presidential election and partial election of members of the National Assembly held in Guatemala on January 19 have been announced. In this election, no presidential candidate obtained the absolute majority of votes stipulated by the constitution. According to the Guatemalan constitution, a presidential candidate can only be elected president after obtaining an absolute majority of votes, that is, obtaining 51% of the votes. In the current situation where no candidate has obtained an absolute majority of votes, the National Assembly will elect one of the two candidates who received the most votes in the election as president. There is news that most of the members of the National Assembly now belong to the "National Democratic Movement Party" that supports Cruz Salazar (according to the voting results, Salazar ranks third). Therefore, it is expected that various political forces in Guatemala will continue to launch new struggles over the presidential position in the future.

    Progress in the Strike Movement

    Montevideo dispatch: The Brazilian "Workers' Voice" summarized the situation of the Brazilian trade union movement in 1957, saying that in that year, large-scale strikes by the working masses occurred more than once in various industrial sectors. More than one million people participated in the strikes demanding wage increases. Metallurgical workers, printing workers, bank clerks, and dockers all won wage increases of 20% to 45%.

    The newspaper pointed out that in 1957, the workers established the United Action Trade Union Joint Committee of the working class and the National Working Committee on Wage Issues. The workers also established some new trade union organizations, such as the Federation of Mine Workers, the National Federation of Bank Clerks, and the Petroleum Enterprise Workers' Union.

    Buenos Aires dispatch: Argentine railway workers, power plant workers, and bank clerks held a strike on the 24th to demand wage increases and welfare benefits, which brought the work of Argentine railways, power plants, and banks to a standstill for a time. At the same time, the construction workers' strike has entered its ninth day on the 24th.

    拉丁美洲政治气候的变化
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：随着整个世界形势朝着有利于和平的方向发展，有美国后院之称的拉丁美洲的政治气候也不能不受到广泛的影响。前已报道，古巴的爱国者游击队在坚持斗争，力量日益扩大；委内瑞拉的人民起来推翻了暴君希门尼斯的反动统治……。从其他一些拉丁美洲国家也不断传来一些使美国统治集团颇感头痛的消息：
    反对美洲国家组织同大西洋集团合并
    布宜诺斯艾利斯讯：阿根廷和平委员会发表了一项声明，坚决斥责企图把美洲国家组织同北大西洋公约组织合并的计划。声明指出，这个计划是美国国务院提出的，它“是对拉丁美洲国家的和平、安宁和主权的威胁”，它会把阿根廷拖入军事冒险中去。
    阿根廷和平委员会强调指出，每一个阿根廷人的职责是坚决反对实现这种招致国家毁灭的计划。
    蒙得维的亚讯：乌拉圭“人民报”不久前发表了危地马拉“爱国阵线”的一个声明，反对美洲国家组织同北大西洋军事集团合并。声明着重指出，企图把这两个组织合并的真实目的是镇压这些国家人民的民族解放斗争。
    主张同社会主义国家发展贸易关系
    纽约讯：美联社记者阿尔曼报道，陷于经济困难中的拉丁美洲国家正纷纷要同社会主义国家进行贸易。
    这个记者写道：在巴西，可以听到赞成同苏联贸易的巨大呼声。巴西舆论担心由于咖啡价格的下降可能带来严重的经济萧条，因此希望同苏联进行贸易谈判。苏联表示愿意给巴西石油设备和技术援助，这大大受到巴西人的欢迎。在智利，尽管智利同苏联没有正式外交关系，智利人希望加强同苏联的贸易和文化关系。铜价不断下降是促成智利要同社会主义国家进行贸易的一个原因。铜出口所获得的收入占智利预算的60％以上，铜价下降已经造成严重的经济紧张。
    阿尔曼说，阿根廷已经派了贸易代表团去苏联和东欧国家，阿根廷特别需要石油工业的设备，它希望从苏联方面获得这种设备。
    他还说，在乌拉圭，由于美国开始津贴国内羊毛生产者而使乌拉圭对美国的羊毛出口大为减少，这个国家受到了严重打击，现在它也希望同苏联进行贸易。
    哥伦比亚现在正在首都波哥大同一个苏联贸易代表团进行谈判。
    民主力量和亲美势力的斗争
    布宜诺斯艾利斯讯：智利社会党在圣地亚哥举行中央全会，讨论了党的政治路线和竞选总统的准备工作。据报纸报道，全会强调指出，社会党的政治目的在于：实现人民行动阵线的纲领。全会指出，人民行动阵线是“在政治上领导劳动人民群众为争取自己的队伍团结一致而斗争的工具”，社会党将为加强人民行动阵线而斗争。与会者特别强调指出，智利社会党人和共产党人在争取实现智利人民的愿望的共同斗争中，获得了相互谅解，这是具有重大意义的。全会指出，社会党对国内外反动势力所支持的伊巴?斯政府采取不调和的态度。谴责帝国主义垄断组织企图缩减智利铜的生产。
    危地马拉城讯：危地马拉在1月19日举行的总统选举和国民大会部分议员选举的初步结果已经宣布。这次选举没有一个总统候选人获得宪法规定的绝对多数票。根据危地马拉宪法，一个总统候选人只有在获得绝对多数票、即获得51％的选票以后，才能当选为总统。在目前没有一个候选人获得绝对多数票的情况下，就要由国民大会在选举中获得最多票数的两个候选人中选出一人作总统。有消息说，现在国民大会的大多数议员都是属于支持克鲁斯·萨拉萨尔（根据投票结果，萨拉萨尔占第三位）的“国民民主运动党”的，因此预料今后危地马拉国内的各种政治力量将继续在总统职位问题上展开新的斗争。
    罢工运动有进展
    蒙得维的亚讯：巴西“工人呼声报”总结1957年巴西工会运动情况说，这一年中，在各种工业部门不止一次地发生了劳动群众大罢工。参加要求提高工资的罢工的有一百多万人。冶金工人、印刷工人、银行职员和码头工人都争取到提高工资20％到45％。
    报纸指出，工人们在1957年建立了工人阶级统一行动工会联合委员会和工资问题全国工作委员会。工人们还建立了一些新的工会组织，如矿山工人联合会、全国银行职员联合会、石油企业工人工会等。
    布宜诺斯艾利斯讯：阿根廷的铁路工人、发电厂工人和银行职员为了要求提高工资和福利金24日举行罢工，使得阿根廷的铁路、发电厂和银行的工作一度陷于停顿。同时，建筑工人的罢工在24日已经进入第九天。
