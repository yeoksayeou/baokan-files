The people of the African continent are today launching a surging national independence movement. From Bizerte in the north to the Cape of Good Hope in the south, the voices of African people demanding independence and freedom are resonating everywhere.

In the early 1940s, the entire African continent, apart from the three independent countries of Egypt, the Union of South Africa, and Liberia, was ruled by Western European colonial powers such as Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, and Portugal under the guise of colonies, protectorates, and mandated territories. Even Egypt, the Union of South Africa, and Liberia were only semi-independent or semi-colonial countries at that time. Therefore, the whole of Africa was virtually under the rule of Western colonialist forces.

However, after the Second World War, due to the tremendous changes in the overall world situation, Africa also awakened. African people launched widespread struggles to win national independence and democratic rights. For example, the 1946 Cairo demonstration of 150,000 people, the 1947 Algerian general strike of 100,000 workers, the Casablanca workers' strike and march in Morocco, the 1948 demonstrations and marches of the people of Kenya, the Gold Coast, and Tunisia, etc., all dealt severe blows to colonialism. At the same time, nationalist parties, various political organizations, mass organizations, etc., in African countries sprang up like mushrooms and began to combine with the struggles of the masses. They put forward the resounding slogan of national independence. However, generally speaking, Africa was still in a period of organizing and gathering strength.

With the defeat of imperialism in Asia, the national independence and liberation movement in Africa has risen higher and higher. In 1951, the United Kingdom of Libya was established; Egypt announced the abolition of the "Anglo-Egyptian Treaty" and the Anglo-Egyptian agreement on the "co-administration" of Sudan. In 1952, the Egyptian anti-British struggle almost reached the point of armed conflict. In 1954, British troops were forced to withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone; Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria successively launched armed uprisings.

The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April 1955 greatly encouraged and promoted the further development of the African national independence movement. Since the Bandung Conference, after two years and eight months of arduous struggle, the face of Africa has changed even more. Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco, and Ghana have successively gained independence and embarked on the road of independent development. Egypt recovered the Suez Canal and, with the support of the Soviet Union, Asian-African countries, and peace-loving people around the world, defeated the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel, defended peace in the Middle East, and consolidated the young Egyptian Republic. The number of independent African countries increased from five before the Bandung Conference to nine. The area of independent countries increased from more than five million square kilometers before the Bandung Conference to more than eight and a half million square kilometers, and the population increased from 57.49 million to 87.15 million.

The newly independent countries have also made great achievements in safeguarding national independence. Morocco recovered Tangier; Libya drove out the French occupying forces; Tunisia abolished the monarchy and declared itself a republic. At the same time, they have also carried out a series of social reforms to eradicate some of the residual systems left over by colonialism. Currently, Libya and Tunisia are fighting to force Britain and France to withdraw their troops. Morocco is also continuing its struggle to recover Mauritania, Spanish Morocco, Ifni, and other places under French and Spanish rule. In addition, Egypt, Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco, and Ghana are also actively supporting the struggles of the people in various countries still under colonial oppression.

Due to the armed suppression by the colonialists, the areas where armed struggle is used to fight for national liberation and oppose colonialism have further expanded and developed. Following Kenya and Algeria, Cameroon and Ifni also launched armed uprisings in 1957. After more than three years of fighting, the Algerian National Liberation Army has grown from 3,000 people at the time of the uprising to more than 100,000 regular troops. The war zone has expanded from the Aures Mountains and the Western Uzou region at the beginning to almost the entire country. Now, the strength of the National Liberation Army has extended to all parts of the country except for several large cities, railways, and highways, and local political organizations—People's Assemblies—have been established in many liberated areas. At the same time, the combat effectiveness of the National Liberation Army has also been greatly strengthened, and it has gradually grasped the initiative in the war. Although France has increased its colonial army from 40,000 at the beginning to 500,000, and dispatched a large number of planes and warships, spending more than 1,000 billion francs in war expenses each year, it has ultimately failed to win. The French ruling class has also had to admit that "the National Liberation Army is an indestructible force."

The "Mau Mau" guerrilla war launched by the Kenyan armed struggle organization against British imperialism has been going on for five years. Although Britain has mobilized more than 30,000 modern troops to suppress it, the Kenyan people are still persisting in the struggle. This war has not only consumed a large amount of British manpower and material resources, but also seriously threatened British colonial rule in East Africa, preventing Britain's plan to organize the East African Federation from being realized. The armed struggle launched by the people of Cameroon has struck at France's attempt to enslave the people of Cameroon for a long time under the guise of trusteeship. The Vice-Chairman of the Cameroon "People's Union" once stated that if the United Nations cannot enable Cameroon to gain independence from French rule, then "Cameroon will become another Algeria." The armed uprising launched by the people of Ifni on November 23, 1957, severely hit the Spanish colonialists and their conspiracy to woo North African countries for the United States to form a Western Mediterranean Group.

With the independence of Sudan, Tunisia, and Morocco, especially the independence of Ghana and the victorious development of the Algerian National Liberation Movement, the national liberation movement in the central African regions has also developed vigorously. Last May, the Uganda National Congress issued a declaration demanding immediate and complete independence, followed by the holding of "Immediate Independence Week" and mass rallies. In the same month, the various parties in the eastern, western, and northern regions of Nigeria unanimously demanded that Britain must grant Nigeria complete independence in 1959. The people of Somaliland also demanded that independence be achieved in 1960 in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Trusteeship Agreement. Although the British government rejected the demands for independence in these regions, under the pressure of the people of various countries, it had to make some concessions, allowing the eastern and western regions of Nigeria to become autonomous, and "consider" the issue of independence in 1960. At the same time, it allowed Uganda to implement autonomy in 1961.

Last February, France, fearing the rising tide of the national liberation movement in French African colonies and fearing that French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa would follow the path of Indochina and North Africa, hurriedly passed the so-called "local autonomy" bill. According to this bill, thirteen semi-autonomous republics, including Senegal, French Sudan, Mauritania, Niger, Upper Volta, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Dahomey, Gabon, Central Congo, Chad, Ubangi-Shari, and Madagascar, were established in French West Africa, French Equatorial Africa, and Madagascar. In March, parliaments were elected according to the "territory law." France attempted to use this to offset the demands of the people in French colonies for national self-determination and prevent the development of the colonial national liberation movement. However, this was resolutely opposed by the people of the colonies. In the election, all candidates who supported the "territory law" were resisted by the people. The French bourgeois newspapers had to admit that the results of this election reflected the growth of the African national liberation movement and the strong desire of the broad masses of African people for self-determination and independence.

Now, in those areas that have always been considered to have relatively stable colonial rule, the national liberation movement has also made great progress. The people of Togo have put forward the demands for unity and independence. Workers' strikes in the Belgian Congo are becoming more frequent and larger in scale. Demonstrations and marches by the people of Angola and Tanganyika are also constantly taking place. They have all shouted the fighting slogan of opposing colonialism.

Although the African continent has different political and social conditions in various regions due to the divided rule of colonialism, resulting in an extremely uneven development of the national liberation movement, the entire African people are raising the banner of national independence and marching towards the victorious road of anti-colonialism. Africa, once the "Dark Continent," has now released a brilliant light of freedom.

However, the road for the people of African countries to fight for independence and liberation is not smooth. The colonialists are not reconciled to being driven out of the African continent. Old colonial countries such as Britain and France are still struggling to continue to enslave the African people. Even in countries that have already gained political independence, the economic forces of colonialists such as Britain and France are still deeply entrenched, continuing to suck the blood and sweat of the people of these countries, making it difficult for the national economies of these countries to develop independently. In particular, American imperialism is taking advantage of the decline of colonial forces such as Britain and France in Africa and is invading Africa on a large scale under the guise of so-called "aid," attempting to replace the old colonial countries such as Britain and France in Africa, enslave the people of African countries, which is something that the people of African countries should be especially vigilant about.

    非洲民族独立运动在高涨中
    刘桐昆
    今天，非洲大陆的人民正掀起汹涌澎湃的民族独立运动。北迄比塞大南至好望角，到处都激荡着非洲人民要求独立自由的声浪。
    四十年代初期，整个非洲大陆除了埃及、南非联邦、利比里亚三个独立国家外，其余地区全被英、法、德、意、西、比、葡等西欧殖民国家分别以殖民地、保护国、委任统治地名义统治着。就是埃及、南非联邦和利比里亚三国，在那时也只是半独立或半殖民地国家。因此，整个非洲当时实际上都处在西方殖民主义势力的统治之下。
    但是，在第二次世界大战以后，由于整个世界局势发生了巨大变化，非洲也觉醒了。非洲人民为了争取民族独立和民主权利，展开了广泛的斗争。例如1946年开罗十五万人的大示威，1947年阿尔及利亚十万工人的大罢工、摩洛哥卡萨布兰卡工人的罢工和游行，1948年怯尼亚、黄金海岸和突尼斯人民的示威和游行等等，都给了殖民主义以严重的打击。与此同时，非洲各国的民族主义政党、各种政治组织、群众团体等如雨后春笋一般地成长起来，并开始同人民群众的斗争相结合。他们提出了民族独立的响亮口号。但是，就非洲总的情况来说，当时还是一个组织和聚集力量的时期。
    随着帝国主义在亚洲的失败，非洲的民族独立解放运动日益高涨起来。1951年利比亚联合王国成立；埃及宣布废除“英埃条约”和英埃“共管”苏丹的协定。1952年埃及反英斗争几乎达到武装冲突的地步。1954年英军被迫从苏伊士运河区撤退；突尼斯、摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚相继发动了武装起义。
    1955年4月在万隆召开的亚非会议，大大地鼓舞和推进了非洲民族独立运动的进一步发展。自万隆会议以后，经过二年零八个月的艰苦斗争，非洲的面貌更加改观了。苏丹、突尼斯、摩洛哥、加纳先后获得了独立，走上了独立发展的道路。埃及收回了苏伊士运河，并在苏联和亚非国家以及全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，打败了英、法和以色列的侵略，保卫了中东的和平，巩固了年青的埃及共和国。非洲的独立国家由万隆会议前的五个增加为九个。独立国家的面积由万隆会议前的五百多万平方公里增加为八百五十万余平方公里，人口由五千七百四十九万增加为八千七百一十五万。
    新独立的国家在维护民族独立方面，也取得了很大的成就。摩洛哥收回了丹吉尔；利比亚赶走了法国占领军；突尼斯废除君主政体，宣布为共和国。与此同时，它们还进行了一系列的社会改革，铲除殖民主义遗留下来的一些残余制度。目前利比亚和突尼斯分别为争取英、法撤军而斗争。摩洛哥为收复法国和西班牙统治下的毛里塔尼亚、西属摩洛哥、伊夫尼等地也在继续进行斗争。此外，埃及、苏丹、突尼斯、摩洛哥、加纳还积极地支持尚处在殖民压迫下的各国人民的斗争。
    由于殖民者实行武装镇压，以武装斗争形式来争取民族解放、反对殖民主义的地区更加扩大和发展了。继怯尼亚和阿尔及利亚之后，1957年喀麦隆和伊夫尼也发动了武装起义。阿尔及利亚民族解放军经过三年多的战斗，正规军已由起义时的三千人发展到十万多人。作战地区由开始时的奥雷斯山区和西乌祖地区几乎扩大到全国范围。现在，民族解放军的力量已伸展到除若干大城市、铁路和公路线以外的全国各个地区，并且在已解放了的许多地区建立了地方政权组织——人民大会。同时，民族解放军的战斗力也大大加强了，并逐步掌握了战争的主动权。法国虽然把殖民军由开始时的四万人增加到五十万人，并出动了大量的飞机、军舰，每年花上一万多亿法郎的战费，但终不能制胜。法国统治阶级也不得不承认“民族解放军是一支不可消灭的力量”。
    怯尼亚武装斗争组织“茅茅”对英帝国主义发动的游击战争已进行了五年。英国虽然调动了三万余现代化军队进行镇压，但怯尼亚人民仍在坚持斗争。这场战争不仅消耗英国大量的人力和物力，而且还严重地威胁着英国在东非的殖民统治，使英国组织东非联邦的计划一直无法实现。喀麦隆人民掀起的武装斗争，打击了法国在托管名义下长期奴役喀麦隆人民的企图。喀麦隆“人民联盟”副主席曾表示：如果联合国不能使喀麦隆从法国统治下获得独立，那么“喀麦隆就将成为另一个阿尔及利亚”。1957年11月23日伊夫尼人民发起的武装起义，狠狠地打击了西班牙殖民者和它为美国拉拢北非国家筹组西地中海集团的阴谋。
    随着苏丹、突尼斯、摩洛哥的独立，特别是加纳的独立和阿尔及利亚民族解放运动的胜利开展，非洲中部各地区的民族解放运动也蓬勃地发展起来。去年5月，乌干达国大党发表宣言，要求立即完全独立，随后并举行了争取“马上独立周”和群众大会。同月，尼日利亚东部、西部和北部三个地区各政党一致要求英国必须在1959年让尼日利亚完全独立。索马里兰人民也要求按照联合国托管协定规定，在1960年实现独立。英国政府虽然拒绝了这些地区的独立的要求，但在各国人民的压力下，也不得不作一些让步，允许尼日利亚东部和西部地区自治，1960年再“考虑”独立问题。同时，允许乌干达在1961年实行自治。
    去年2月法国慑于法属非洲殖民地民族解放运动的高涨，害怕法属西非、法属赤道非洲走印度支那和北非的道路，急忙通过所谓“地方自治”权法案。根据这一法案，在法属西非、法属赤道非洲和马达加斯加成立了塞内加尔、法属苏丹、毛里塔尼亚、尼日尔、上伏尔达、法属几内亚、象牙海岸、达荷美、加蓬、中央刚果、乍得、乌班吉沙立和马达加斯加十三个半自治共和国。3月又根据“领域法”选举了议会。法国企图以此来抵销法属殖民地人民的民族自决要求，阻止殖民地民族解放运动的发展。但是，这遭到殖民地人民的坚决反对。在选举中凡是拥护“领域法”的候选人都受到了人民的抵制。法国资产阶级报纸也不得不承认，这次选举结果正反映了非洲民族解放运动的壮大，反映了广大非洲人民要求自决、独立的强烈愿望。
    现在，在那些一向被认为殖民主义统治比较稳固的地区，民族解放运动也有了很大的发展。多哥人民提出了统一和独立的要求。比属刚果工人的罢工日益频繁，规模日渐扩大。安哥拉和坦噶尼喀人民的示威游行也在不断发生。他们都喊出了反对殖民主义的战斗口号。
    非洲大陆虽然由于殖民主义的分割统治，各地区政治、社会条件不同，致使民族解放运动的发展极不平衡。但是，整个非洲人民正在高举着民族独立的旗子向反殖民主义的胜利道路挺进。曾经是“黑暗大陆”的非洲如今已放出了灿烂的自由光辉。
    但是，非洲各国人民争取独立解放的道路并不是平坦的。殖民主义者不甘心被赶出非洲大陆。英、法等老牌殖民国家，还在竭力挣扎，力图继续奴役非洲人民。即使在政治上已经获得独立的国家里，英法等殖民主义经济势力也还根深蒂固，继续吮吸这些国家人民的血汗，使这些国家的民族经济难于独立发展。特别是美帝国主义趁英法等殖民主义势力在非洲的衰落，正打着所谓“援助”的幌子大举侵入非洲，企图取代英法等旧殖民国家在非洲的地位，奴役非洲各国人民，这是值得非洲各国人民特别警惕的。
