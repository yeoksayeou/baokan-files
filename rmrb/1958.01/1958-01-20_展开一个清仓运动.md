Launch a Stocktaking Campaign
    Jing Yu
    Exposing waste and eliminating waste must be approached from all directions.
    Opening warehouses, clearing materials, and launching a stocktaking campaign to quickly put those useful materials sleeping in warehouses into production and construction should be an important aspect of eliminating waste.
    The problem of stockpiled materials in warehouses has existed for a long time. Last year, the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Supervision, and the State Statistical Bureau jointly conducted a focused inspection of the material inventory of several production and capital construction units in order to thoroughly understand the situation and rationally arrange production. The inspection revealed that many units had unclear inventory situations, and the phenomenon of overreporting was quite common and quite serious. After that inspection, the phenomenon of stockpiled materials exceeding normal reserves has decreased somewhat, but because the broad masses had not yet risen up against waste at that time, the warehouse inventory work was not thoroughly resolved.
    Now, the situation is different. In the rectification movement, special forums against waste have begun successively in various places, and some workers have aimed their fire at the wasteful phenomenon of massive material stockpiles, exposing many shocking facts: the drills stockpiled in the warehouse of the Beijing Radio Factory could be used for forty years; the files stockpiled in the warehouse of the Beijing Auto Parts Factory could be used for thirty years; the forms stockpiled by the Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill would not be used up in forty years. Luoyang Bearing Factory has stockpiled a large amount of construction materials, some of which have deteriorated (this case is reported on the front page of today's newspaper)... It can be seen how serious the problem of material stockpiles in warehouses is.
    When the person in charge of the Industrial Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on factories and mines to tap potential, he asked to aim the spearhead of anti-waste at seven aspects, two of which mentioned warehouses. This makes perfect sense. Every unit has almost a warehouse, in addition to large warehouses, there are also numerous small warehouses, large warehouses have excessive reserves, and small warehouses also have excessive reserves, if all the large and small warehouses in the country have excessive reserves, how serious waste it is!
    The seriousness of the problem is not only in the stockpiling and waste of materials. Warehouses are a tool for storing materials and ensuring production and construction, not a tool for harboring bureaucracy and departmentalism. However, now some warehouses have indeed become breeding grounds for bureaucracy and departmentalism. Some leaders are ignorant of the situation in the warehouse, and when the lower levels call for a lack of materials, they follow suit without thinking. In addition, some departmentalists only care about their own convenience, and do not hesitate to exaggerate consumption, stockpile more inventory, and even resort to unscrupulous means to disperse materials, conceal the truth, and are unwilling to exchange materials, so that it is beneficial to national construction. This style of work has brought great losses to production.
    Anti-waste is an important part of the rectification stage and a long-term task in the future. When clearing warehouses, in addition to finding a batch of stockpiled materials and immediately exchanging these materials for use in production and construction, we must also improve material reserves and warehouse management, and take advantage of the wind of the rectification movement to burn off bureaucracy and departmentalism in this area, and make a major improvement in material storage work.

    展开一个清仓运动
    静宇
    揭发浪费，消灭浪费，要从四面八方下手。
    打开仓库，清理物资，展开一个清仓运动，让那些沉睡在仓库里的有用物资很快地参加到生产建设中去，应当是消灭浪费的一个重要方面。
    仓库物资积压的问题存在已久。去年，国家经济委员会、中央监察部、国家统计局等三单位，为了切实摸清家底、合理安排生产，曾经联合对若干生产和基本建设单位的物资库存进行了重点检查，检查结果，发现许多单位库存情况不清，以多报少的现象相当普遍，也相当严重。那一次检查以后，超过正常储备量的积压物资现象已经有所减少，但由于那时广大群众还没有起来反对浪费，仓库的清查工作也就没有彻底解决。
    现在，情况不同了。在整风运动中，反浪费的专题鸣放已经先后在各地开始，有些职工已经对准物资大量积压的浪费现象开火，揭发了许多惊人事实：北京无线电厂的仓库里积压的一种钻头可用四十年；北京汽车附件厂的仓库里积压的锉刀可用三十年；北京国棉三厂积压的表报四十年也用不完。洛阳轴承厂积压了大量建筑材料，有的已经变质（此事例载本报今日第一版）……。可见仓库里物资积压问题是如何严重了。
    中共北京市委工业部负责人在号召各厂矿挖掘潜力的时候，要求把反浪费的矛头对准七个方面，其中有两个方面都提到仓库。这是很有道理的。每个单位差不多都有个仓库，除了大型仓库以外，还有为数众多的小仓库，大仓库有超额储备，小仓库也有超额储备，如果全国大大小小的仓库都有超额储备，该是多么严重的浪费啊！
    问题的严重性还不仅仅在物资的积压和浪费方面。仓库是储存物资、保证生产建设的一种工具。而不是窝藏官僚主义、本位主义的工具。可是，现在确实有些仓库成了官僚主义、本位主义的窝藏所。有些领导人员，对于仓库的情况茫然无知，下面叫材料不足，他们也不动脑筋跟着叫喊。另外，有些本位主义者只顾自己用起来方便，就不惜夸大消耗，多搞库存，甚至不择手段地疏散物资，隐瞒真情，而不愿把物资交流，使其有利于国家建设。这种作风给生产带来了很大损失。
    反浪费是整改阶段的重要部分，也是今后一个长时期的任务。在清查仓库的时候，除了要搞出一批积压的物资，并且立即使这些物资交流，用到生产和建设中去以外，还要改进物资储备、仓库管理工作，乘整风运动之风，把这方面的官僚主义、本位主义烧掉，把物资储存工作来一个大改进。
