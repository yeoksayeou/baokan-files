Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 19th: The New York "Daily Worker," with a history of thirty-four years, ceased publication on the 13th. This was a decision made at a meeting of the National Executive Committee of the American Communist Party at the end of last year. The decision stated that the continuous increase in publishing costs has placed the "Daily Worker" and other labor newspapers in a difficult situation. Therefore, it is necessary to temporarily suspend publication of the "Daily Worker" for a period of time to ensure the strengthening and continued publication of the "Daily Worker" Weekend Edition. At this meeting, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Gates, was the only one who opposed the suspension of the "Daily Worker."

Gates is the ringleader in advocating revisionism within the American communist movement. Under Gates' direction, the "Daily Worker" frequently published his own and other revisionist elements' speeches advocating revisionism. Its international news editor, Clark, after being criticized for using the "Daily Worker" to spread revisionism, resigned from the party several months ago and published a statement in the bourgeois press attacking the American Communist Party.

After the "Daily Worker" decided to cease publication, Gates immediately hosted reporters in New York on the 10th, declaring that he had resigned from the party and slandering the American Communist Party leader William Foster. Regarding Gates' resignation from the party, the National Executive Committee of the American Communist Party issued a statement saying that for some time, Gates has been trying to change many basic principles of Marxism. He not only abused the right to express different opinions within the party, but also gave talks to the bourgeois press to wage a sharp struggle against the party. He has now become a person openly opposed to the Communist Party and the Marxist program of the working class.

    美共“工人日报”暂时停刊
    修正主义分子盖茨已经退党
    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：有三十四年历史的纽约“工人日报”，已于13日停刊。这是去年年底美国共产党全国执行委员会的一次会议上作出的决定。决定中说，由于出版成本的不断上涨，已使“工人日报”和其他劳工报纸处于困境，因此暂时停止出版“工人日报”一个时期是必要的，这样可以保证“工人日报星期刊”的加强和继续出版。在这一次会议上，该报总编辑盖茨是唯一反对“工人日报”停刊的人。
    盖茨是在美国共产主义运动内部鼓吹修正主义的首脑。在盖茨的主持下，“工人日报”经常刊载他本人和其他修正主义分子鼓吹修正主义的言论。它的国际新闻编辑克拉克，在被批评利用“工人日报”散布修正主义之后，已于数月前退党，并向资产阶级报纸发表声明攻击美共。
    “工人日报”决定停刊之后，盖茨即在10日在纽约招待记者，声明他已经退党，并污蔑美共领导人威廉·福斯特。关于盖茨退党一事，美共全国行政委员会曾发表声明说，在若干时期以来，盖茨一直在企图改变马克思主义的许多基本原则。他不仅滥用在党内可以发表不同意见的权利，并且向资产阶级报纸发表谈话来向党进行尖锐的斗争。他现在已经成为一个公然反对共产党和马克思主义的工人阶级纲领的人。
