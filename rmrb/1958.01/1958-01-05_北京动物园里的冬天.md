Winter in the Beijing Zoo
Cui Zhanping

In the Beijing Zoo, there are elephants from India, black rhinos, hippos, and giraffes from the hottest regions of Africa, and polar bears from the Arctic Ocean. How do they live when this cold winter descends?

Animals are very sensitive to their living environment. The four elephants in the Beijing Zoo came from India, Vietnam, Burma, and Pakistan. Their ancestors lived in those hot countries for generations and never knew what ice and snow and severe cold were. When they first came to Beijing, the Beijing Zoo had already prepared elephant houses with heating equipment for them. In the spacious and bright elephant house, it is as warm as spring. Even so, when they spent their first winter in Beijing, sometimes their skin cracked a little due to the low temperature, and they had to be smeared with Vaseline oil. After living for a long time, they gradually got used to it, and the temperature of the elephant house was lowered a bit in the second year; it was even lower in the third year. Because the elephants have almost no hair all over their bodies to keep them warm, the temperature in the elephant house is now kept at 10-12 degrees Celsius and cannot be lowered any further. You know, when they feel cold, they will show uneasiness, shiver, and knock on the floor with their long noses!

The Nilgai from India and the zebras and wildebeests from Africa were obviously very afraid of the cold when they spent their first winter in Beijing. But after several winters, they have gradually become accustomed to the climate in Beijing. Sometimes, in heavy snow, these Nilgai and zebras still walk and roll in the snow.

It is particularly worth mentioning the African lions in the zoo. Their ancestors left the African wilderness forty or fifty years ago. They have lived in the zoo for several generations and dozens of generations, and they have long forgotten the scenery of their hometown. You see, they are not very afraid of the heat in the hot summer in Beijing; in winter, they often take their cubs to run around in the snow, not afraid of the cold at all.

The peacock guests from India and Java never bother the owners of the zoo in winter, and they can safely spend the winter relying on their beautiful plumage. Moreover, they still breed as usual in the following spring. The emu birds also maintain their breeding habits in Australia, laying eggs in December, and do not feel any inconvenience to this cold winter.

The most afraid of the cold are those cold-blooded animals—snakes, pythons, etc. Their body temperature rises or falls completely with the outside temperature. In summer, the body temperature of a python can reach 35-40 degrees Celsius; in winter, the body temperature drops to about 10 degrees. However, the pythons and snakes living in the zoo still live in warm rooms at 25-30 degrees Celsius in winter, and they have also lost the habit of hibernation. If the temperature in their room drops below 8 degrees Celsius, these pythons are in danger of death.

The most welcoming to winter are the polar bears. These guests from the Arctic finally survived the hot summer and have long been looking forward to the arrival of the cold winter. In the weather of minus eighteen or nineteen degrees, they still go to the cold water pool to swim, splashing white splashes in the pool. After they crawl out of the water, their bodies are immediately covered with ice cones, and they make a clanging sound when they walk, but they don't care at all, and instead show a refreshed and very happy appearance. It turns out that under their skin, there is more than an inch of subcutaneous fat, and they are not afraid even if it is colder.

The polar bear's cousins—black bears, brown bears, and horse bears, especially the various bears produced in Siberia and the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, do not like winter as much as polar bears. Although they have lived in the zoo for many years, they have not changed their habit of hibernation. These bears hibernate not because they are afraid of the cold, but because in the winter in the Khingan Mountains, Changbai Mountains, and Siberia, the forests are full of knee-deep snow, and they cannot find any food, nor can they have seals to prey on like polar bears. They have to hide in rock caves in deep valleys or in decaying tree holes to survive this cold period. However, their hibernation is completely different from that of snakes and pythons, it is just a state of coma and sleep. In the Beijing Zoo, black bears, brown bears, and horse bears eat very little food in winter, sometimes not eating for two or three days, and curl up in their nests all day long, rarely moving.

As for those truly cold-fearing animals, such as the heavy hippos, they spend almost seventeen or eighteen hours of the day soaking in warm pools. The giraffe's housing, with its unusually long neck, is not only tall and spacious, but also warm as spring. In the cold winter, this is often the place where tourists like to linger the most.

    北京动物园里的冬天
    崔占平
    在北京动物园里，有来自印度的大象，来自非洲最炎热地区的黑犀、河马和长颈鹿，也有来自北冰洋的白熊。当这寒冷的冬天降临的时候，它们在怎样生活呢？
    动物对于生活环境的反应是非常敏感的。北京动物园里的四只大象，是从印度、越南、缅甸和巴基斯坦几个国家来的。它们的祖先一代一代地生活在那炎热的国家里，从来不知道什么是冰雪和严寒。当它们第一次来到北京的时候，北京动物园里早就为它们准备了有暖气设备的象房。在宽敞明亮的象房里，温暖如春。虽然如此，当它们在北京度过第一个冬天的时候，有时候因为温度低，皮肤裂了些小口，还得给它涂些凡士林油。生活久了，慢慢地就习惯起来，第二年象房的温度就降低了一些；第三年更低一些。因为大象浑身上下几乎没有一点毛来替它保温，所以现在在象房里一直保持着摄氏10—12度，不得再降低了。要知道，当它们一感到冷的时候，就要表现神情不安，身上发抖，用长鼻子噹噹地敲打地板啊！
    从印度来的兰牛羚，非洲来的斑马、角马，第一年在北京过冬的时候，显然是很怕冷的。可是经过几个冬天以后，它们已经渐渐地习惯了北京的气候。有时在大雪纷飞的天气里，这些兰牛羚和斑马，仍然在雪地里散步、打滚。
    特别值得一提的是动物园里的非洲狮子。它们的祖先离开非洲原野已经四、五十年了，它们几代、几十代都生活在动物园里，早已忘记了它们家乡的景色。你看，它们在北京炎热的夏天，既不怎么怕热；到了冬天，还经常带着幼狮在雪地上跑来跑去，一点也不怕冷。
    来自印度和爪哇的孔雀客人，在冬季从来不麻烦园里的主人，仅靠着它们那美丽的羽衣，就可以安全地度过冬天。而且翌年春季照例繁殖。还有鸸鹋鸟，仍然保持着它们在澳洲生活时的繁殖规律，在12月份内产卵，对于这寒冷的冬天并不感到有什么不便。
    最怕冷的，要算那些冷血动物——蛇、蟒等。它们的体温，完全随着外界的温度升高或者降低。大蟒，在夏天体温能达到摄氏35—40度；到了冬天，体温就降到10度左右。可是住在动物园里的蟒和蛇，冬季里仍然住在摄氏25—30度的暖室内，也就失去了冬眠的习性。假如他们的住室气温下降到摄氏8度以下，这些蟒蛇就有死亡的危险。
    最欢迎冬天的，莫过于白熊。这些从北极来的客人，好容易度过了炎热的夏天，早就盼望着寒冬的来临。在零下十八、九度的天气里，他们仍然下到冷水池里去游泳，在池中一阵阵扑打起雪白的水花。当他们从水中爬出来以后，浑身上下马上都结成了冰锥，走起路来叮噹乱响，但是它们满不在乎，反而显出精神焕发，十分愉快的样子。原来在它们的皮肤下面，有一寸多厚的皮下脂肪，即使再冷一些，它们也不怕。
    白熊的宗兄宗弟们——黑熊、棕熊和马熊，特别是产在西伯利亚和大、小兴安岭的各种熊，就不像白熊那样喜爱冬天了。虽然它们已经在动物园里生活了许多年，但是它们还没有改掉冬眠的习惯。这些熊要冬眠，并不是因为怕冷，而是因为在兴安岭、长白山、西伯利亚的冬天，森林里积满了没膝大雪，找不到任何食物，也不能像白熊那样有海豹可以捕食。它们就不得不躲藏在深谷的岩洞中或枯朽的树洞中，熬过这寒冷的岁月。不过它们的冬眠完全不同于蛇、蟒，只是一种昏迷状态的沉睡。在动物园的黑熊、棕熊和马熊，每到冬季就只吃很少的食物，有时候甚至两三天不吃东西，整天在窝里卷成一团，很少游动。
    至于那些真正怕冷的动物，如那笨重的河马，它们在一天二十四小时中，差不多有十七、八个小时都泡在温暖的水池中。那脖子长得出奇的长颈鹿的住房，不但高大宽敞，同时也是温暖如春。在严寒的冬季里，这里常是游客们最喜欢逗留的地方。
