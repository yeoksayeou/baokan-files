Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 13th:  Staff members in Tianjin hospitals are displaying revolutionary zeal during rectification, resolutely breaking old conventions and regulations, leading to a series of encouraging new changes in hospital work.

The contradictions of crowded outpatient departments and insufficient medical resources relative to the number of patients, which Tianjin hospitals have long considered difficult to resolve, have been greatly alleviated during this rectification. Some old systems that have been followed for many years have been replaced by revolutionary new measures, making medical and health institutions more in line with socialist construction and the needs of the working people. The three-shift system for outpatient services is one such revolutionary measure. In the past, due to crowded outpatient departments and the outpatient hours coinciding with workers' working hours, an average of more than 17,900 workdays were lost daily due to workers taking leave to seek medical treatment. Now, all twenty-seven hospitals in the city have implemented a three-shift system for outpatient services, expanding the outpatient capacity and allowing workers to seek medical treatment in their spare time. At the Tianjin Municipal Children's Hospital, in early January, of the thirty-eight children registered between 5:00 AM and 8:00 AM on one morning alone, twenty-five were brought by female workers from factories such as textile mills, knitting factories, and wool mills who had just finished their night shifts. Peng Wenqin, a female worker at the Tianjin Dyeing Factory, finished her shift at 5:00 AM and spent only fifty minutes at the hospital to have her child examined and get medicine. Before leaving, she said to the head nurse, "Now I can go home and still get some sleep. This change you've made is really too convenient."

Medical workers have begun to reverse the bourgeois medical viewpoint of "valuing inpatient care over outpatient care" and establish a socialist medical viewpoint that serves production and prioritizes the patient. In the past, senior medical personnel such as hospital directors, experts, and department heads did not participate in or rarely participated in outpatient services. Now, almost all of them are participating in outpatient work. Their participation in outpatient services not only allows them to utilize their expertise but also improves the quality of medical care. Furthermore, they can discover and promptly resolve major issues in outpatient work. In the outpatient clinic of Lu Guanzhu, the director of Tianjin Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, there are many patients suffering from various difficult and complicated diseases. Since the end of November of last year, he has diagnosed more than four hundred people and has relieved the suffering of dozens of patients plagued by illness. Zhou Longgao, an experienced internal medicine doctor and director of the Second Central Hospital, had not participated in outpatient services for nine years. After participating in outpatient services this time, he discovered and promptly resolved issues such as chaotic outpatient records, unsanitary environments, and certain unreasonable rules and regulations. He said, "Using this method to understand problems in the work is much more detailed, specific, timely, and profound than sitting in the office listening to reports. This is truly a good remedy for curing the bureaucratic tendencies of hospital leaders."

The Tianjin Municipal Workers' Hospital originally had an old rule that had been followed for many years: all inpatients had to get up at 4:30 AM. Now, this practice has also been broken, and patients now get up at 7:00 AM. The staff of this hospital had argued fiercely about this reform. After clarifying the idea of prioritizing the patient through debate, this issue was finally resolved. Other regulations in the hospital that were unfavorable to patients have also been reformed one after another, and the care for patients has become more considerate. The obstetrics and gynecology department of the Workers' Hospital even vacated its office to use it as a ward, moving the beds that were originally placed in the corridor into the office, and the staff of the obstetrics and gynecology department moved to work in the corridor. Under the leadership of the entire staff of the obstetrics and gynecology department, this hospital vacated wards with a capacity of twenty-five beds.

Currently, seven hospitals in the city have added 103 simple beds. These simple beds can accommodate the increase in inpatients after the implementation of the three-shift outpatient system, and they also allow for rapid turnover, so that patients who need short-term hospitalization or short-term observation can be admitted to the hospital at any time. At the same time, patients bring their own bedding and utensils, and family members can provide care, reducing the patient's hospitalization costs by about one-third.

During the rectification, many hospitals exposed serious waste phenomena and proposed improvement plans. Many hospitals have begun to show a new atmosphere of running hospitals diligently and thriftily. After the city's hospitals implemented the three-shift outpatient system, the number of outpatient visits increased by one-third, the number of beds increased by more than two hundred, and the number of staff decreased by one-sixth.

After the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the mental outlook of medical personnel, especially senior medical personnel, has undergone tremendous changes. Many senior medical personnel and experts have gradually become accustomed to criticism and self-criticism. During the movement, they not only posted big-character posters criticizing the three bad styles of leadership but also examined their own shortcomings.

### 雷厉风行　打破陈规　进行整改  天津各医院出现振奋人心的新气象

    雷厉风行　打破陈规　进行整改
    天津各医院出现振奋人心的新气象
    据新华社天津13日电　天津市各医院工作人员在整改中鼓起革命的干劲，雷厉风行地打破陈规旧律，使医院工作出现了一系列振奋人心的新气象。
    历年来天津市各医院一向认为难以解决的门诊拥挤、病人多而医疗力量不足的矛盾在这次整改中大大缓和了，沿袭多年的一些旧制度被革命的新措施代替以后，使医疗卫生机构更加符合社会主义建设和劳动人民的需要。门诊三班制就是实行的一项革命措施。过去由于门诊拥挤，门诊时间又在职工上班时间，平均每天因职工请假就医而损失的劳动日达一万七千九百多个。现在全市二十七所医院都实行了门诊三班制，扩大了门诊量，职工可以利用业余时间就医。天津市立儿童医院在1月初，仅一天早晨五时到八时挂号的三十八名儿童中，就有二十五名儿童是纺织厂、针织厂、毛织厂等工厂刚下夜班的女工带来看病的。天津漂染厂的女工彭文琴是早晨五点下班的，到医院只用五十分钟的时间就给小孩看完了病、取好了药。临去时，她对医院的护士长说：“现在回家还误不了睡觉，你们这一改，真是太方便了”。
    医务工作者开始扭转“轻门诊、重病房”的资产阶级医疗观点，树立为生产服务、从病人出发的社会主义医疗观点。过去不参加或很少参加门诊的院长、专家、科主任等高级医务人员，现在差不多都参加了门诊工作，他们参加门诊后一方面能够发挥专长，同时提高了医疗质量，并在门诊工作中能够发现和及时解决一些重大问题。在天津中医医院院长陆观虎的门诊室里，有许多患各种疑难病症的病人。从去年11月底到现在，他诊断了四百多人次，已经为几十名被病魔缠身的患者解除了痛苦。富有临床经验的内科大夫、第二中心医院院长周隆高，已经九年没参加过门诊。当他这次参加门诊以后，曾发现和及时解决了门诊病历混乱、环境不卫生以及某些不合理的规章制度。他说：用这样办法来了解工作中的问题比坐在办公室里听汇报要细致、具体、及时、深刻得多。这真是医治医院领导人员官僚主义的一剂好药方。
    天津市立工人医院原来有这样沿袭多年的老规矩：住院病人一律要在早晨四点半钟起床，现在也打破了这个惯例，病人改为七点起床了。这个医院的工作人员曾为这项改革，争论得面红耳赤。经过辩论明确了一切从病人出发的思想以后，这个问题终于解决了。医院里其它不利于病人的规定，也相继得到了改革，对病人的照顾周到了。工人医院妇产科并把办公室腾出来作病房，原来放在走廊上的病床搬到办公室去，妇产科的工作人员就挪到走廊上办公。这所医院在妇产科全体人员的带动下，共腾出了能容纳二十五张病床的病房。
    现在，全市已经有七所医院增设了简易病床一百零三张，这种简易病床可以适应改行门诊三班制以后住院病人增加的情况，而且病床周转快，需要短期住院治疗或需要短期观察病情的病人可以随时住院。同时，病人自带被服用具，家属可以护理，使病人的住院费用减轻三分之一左右。
    在整改中很多医院揭发了严重的浪费现象，并提出改进的方案。许多医院开始出现了勤俭办医院的新风气。全市医院在实行门诊三班制以后，门诊量增加了三分之一，病床增加了二百多张，人员反而减少了六分之一。
    经过整风和反右派斗争，医务人员特别是高级医务人员的精神面貌发生了巨大变化。许多高级医务人员、专家逐渐习惯了批评和自我批评，他们在运动中一方面贴大字报批评领导上的三个坏主义，一方面检查自己的缺点。
