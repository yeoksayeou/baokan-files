The basic situation of mountainous areas in China

I. Area, cultivated land, and population

China has a vast mountainous area, accounting for about 80% of the country's total area. According to statistics from the State Council's Mountainous Area Production Planning Office, there are approximately 1,500 mountainous and semi-mountainous counties in the country, accounting for 60% of the total number of counties. The mountainous population is about 200 million, accounting for about one-third of the country's total population. Excluding ethnic minority areas such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia, according to statistics from 21 provinces, there are 1,237 mountainous and semi-mountainous counties, accounting for more than half of the total number of counties in these provinces. Mountainous land area accounts for 62.4% of the total land area of these provinces, with over 560 million mu of cultivated land, accounting for 35.8% of the total cultivated land. Grain output also accounts for about one-third.

There are a total of 869 old revolutionary base area counties in the country, with a population of 120 million. The vast majority of these revolutionary base areas are mountainous.

China's ethnic minority population is close to 40 million, of which about 17 million live in mountainous areas.

II. Huge potential for developing diversified economies in mountainous areas

The mountainous areas across the country are rich in cash crops and local specialties, and there is great potential for increased production. In terms of cash crops: the national tung oil production was 96,100 tons in 1949, and increased to 140,000 tons in 1956, approaching the historical peak level. However, its potential for increased production is still very large. After several years of recovery, camellia oil production reached 100,373.6 tons in 1954, but it was still 40% lower than the national peak output in 1936 (more than 150,000 tons). According to 1955 statistics, the annual output value of various fresh and dried fruits reached 347,776,000 yuan. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, if management is strengthened and output is increased by 50%-60%, it is entirely possible for existing fruit trees. Tea, which is distributed in provinces south of the Qinling Mountains and the Huai River, had an annual output value of about 10,067,000 yuan in 1956. New tea gardens can also be developed in large quantities in mountainous areas. Sericulture is an important avenue for production in mountainous areas. According to 1956 statistics: the annual output value of domestic silkworm cocoons was 41,700,000 yuan, and the annual output value of tussah silkworm cocoons was 47,180,000 yuan. The Northeast region accounts for 84.6% of the national area suitable for raising tussah silkworms, about 70 million mu. However, only 17.5 million mu is currently utilized. The southernmost part of China is rich in tropical crops, such as rubber, agave, and coffee, all of which are products with high economic value. It is estimated that there are about 100 million mu of unused wasteland in Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, and other provinces that can develop tropical crops. There are more than 350 kinds of local specialties in mountainous areas, including major medicinal materials, with a total output of 6.25 million dan and a total output value of about 22,545,000 yuan. According to incomplete statistics for the past four years, the annual output value of four mountainous products, namely bamboo, handmade paper, raw lacquer, and medicinal materials, reached 41.6 billion yuan. According to materials provided at the Mountainous Area Commercial Work Conference convened by the Fifth Office of the State Council last autumn, Zhejiang Province conducted a general survey and learned that there are more than 2,500 kinds of local products in the province. Hunan has 892 kinds of small local products with a total output value of 440 million yuan.

Mountainous materials occupy an extremely important position in China's export trade. According to statistics from the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the total export value of goods produced in mountainous areas (including mountainous minerals) accounts for more than half of the country's total export value. Tung oil alone accounts for 10% of the total value of export goods. Sichuan provides 307 kinds of commodities for export, most of which are produced in mountainous areas.

III. Current production level and living conditions in mountainous areas

Since liberation, the mountainous economy has continuously recovered and developed. At present, production in some mountainous areas has caught up with or exceeded the highest level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the mountainous areas of Fujian Province, agricultural and sideline products such as grain, sugarcane, flue-cured tobacco, jute, tea, fruit, live pigs, and dried bamboo shoots have greatly exceeded pre-war levels. Grain production in the mountainous areas of Hebei Province has increased by about 4.4% annually since liberation, and recovered to pre-war levels by 1952.

The living standards of the people in mountainous areas have generally improved. According to surveys conducted in mountainous areas of Hubei Province, the average income per person in 1956 was 30 yuan in some areas, generally 40-50 yuan, 70-100 yuan in high-income areas, and occasionally exceeded 200 yuan. In Zhushan County, the average grain per person in the county was 434 jin in 1952, and increased to 558 jin in 1956. Changyang County used to be a grain-deficient county, but grain was sufficient in 1956. More than 2,000 of the 7,000 agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous areas of Jiangxi Province have caught up with or exceeded the production and income levels of local wealthy middle peasants.

However, the economic development of mountainous areas is currently very uneven, and the people in many mountainous areas, especially in the northern regions, are still poorer than those in the plains.

Shandong Province divides the province's mountainous areas into three categories: the first category is areas with good soil and water conservation, with an average annual income of more than 60-70 yuan per person, about double the pre-war level. This type of mountainous area accounts for 30%. The second category is areas with poor soil and water conservation and insufficient development of diversified operations, with an average annual income of about 40-50 yuan per person. Although there has been an increase compared to pre-war levels, there are still some difficulties in production and life. This type of mountainous area accounts for 50%. The third category is areas with an average annual income of about 30 yuan per person, and the people's lives are very difficult. This type of mountainous area accounts for 20%.

### 我国山区的基本情况

    我国山区的基本情况
    一、面积、耕地、人口
    我国山区面积很大，占我国总面积的80％左右。据国务院山区生产规划办公室统计，全国山区、半山区约有一千五百个县，占全国县数的60％。山区人口约有二亿多，约占全国总人口的三分之一。除新疆、青海、西藏、内蒙古等少数民族地区外，据二十一个省统计，山区、半山区的县份有一千二百三十七个，占这些省总县数的一半以上；山区土地面积占这些省土地总面积的62.4％，耕地有五亿六千多万亩，占耕地总面积的35.8％；粮食产量也占三分之一左右。
    全国老根据地共有八百六十九个县，一亿二千万人。这些革命根据地绝大多数是山区。
    我国少数民族人口接近四千万人，其中约有一千七百万人居住在山区。
  二、山区发展多种经济的巨大潜力
    全国山区经济作物和土特产丰富，增产的潜力也很大。在经济作物方面：全国桐油产量1949年为九万六千一百吨，1956年增加到十四万吨，接近历史上最高水平。但是它的增产潜力还很大。油茶，经过几年的恢复，到1954年茶油产量达到十万零三千七百三十六吨，但与1936年全国最高产量（十五万多吨）比仍然低40％。各种干鲜果据1955年统计，年产值达三亿四千七百七十六万元。现有的果树，在第二个五年计划期间，如加强管理，提高产量50％—60％，是完全可能的。分布在秦岭、淮河以南各省的茶叶，据1956年统计，年产值约一万零六十七万元。在山区还可以大量开辟新茶园。养蚕是山区重要生产门路，据1956年统计：全国家蚕茧年产值四千一百七十万元，柞蚕茧年产值四千七百一十八万元。在全国能放养柞蚕的山场中东北区占84.6％，约七千万亩。但目前仅利用一千七百五十万亩。我国最南部盛产热带作物，如橡胶、龙舌兰、咖啡等都是经济价值很高的产品。目前可以发展热带作物的广西、福建、云南等省估计还没有利用的荒地约一亿亩。山区土特产，仅主要药材就有三百五十多种，总产量六百二十五万担，总产值约二万二千五百四十五万元。据最近四年不完全统计，毛竹、土纸、生漆和药材四种山区土产，年产值即达四百一十六亿元。据国务院第五办公室去年秋季召开的山区商业工作会议上提供的材料，浙江省经过普查，了解到全省有二千五百多种土产。湖南有小土产八百九十二种，总产值四点四亿元。
    山区物资在我国出口贸易中占着极重要的地位。据对外贸易部的统计，山区出产货物的出口总值（包括山区矿产）占全国出口总产值的一半以上。仅桐油一项即占出口物资总值的10％。四川提供出口的商品有三百零七种，绝大部分产于山区。
  三、目前山区的生产水平
        和生活状况
    解放以后，山区经济不断恢复、发展。目前，有些山区生产已经赶上或者超过抗日战争前的最高水平。福建省山区的粮食、甘蔗、烤烟、黄麻、茶叶、果产、毛猪、笋干等农、副产品，都已大大超过了战前水平。河北省山区的粮食生产，解放后大约每年增长4.4％，1952年就已恢复到战前水平。
    山区人民的生活一般都有所提高。据湖北省各地在山区的调查，1956年每人平均收入，少的是三十元，一般的是四十——五十元，高的是七十——一百元，个别的超过二百元。竹山县1952年全县平均每人有粮食四百三十四斤，1956年，增加到五百五十八斤。长阳县从前是缺粮县，1956年粮食够吃了。江西省山区七千多个农业社中有二千多个农业社赶上或超过了当地富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平。
    但是，目前山区经济的发展是很不平衡的，许多山区特别是北方的山区人民生活还是比平原地区贫苦一些。
    山东省将全省山区分三类情况：第一类是水土保持较好的地区，平均每人每年收入六十——七十元以上，比战前提高一倍左右。此类山区占30％。第二类，水土保持较差，多种经营发展不够，平均每人每年收入约在四十——五十元左右，虽比战前有了提高，但生产生活尚存在某些困难。此类山区占50％。第三类，每人每年平均收入三十元左右，人民生活很困难。此类山区占20％。
