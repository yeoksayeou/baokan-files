    Correctly Treat New Things
    Over the past few years, there have been two different attitudes towards the double-wheeled double-furrow plow, which have produced different consequences.

    One view held that the double-wheeled double-furrow plow was not suitable for paddy fields. The comrades in Zhejiang did not think so. They worked diligently, conducted many experiments and promoted its use, widely applying the double-wheeled double-furrow plow in paddy field cultivation. Now, they are using facts to declare to everyone: the double-wheeled double-furrow plow has increased rice production, it has taken root in many places in Zhejiang, and it has taken root in the minds of the vast number of farmers and cadres.

    When the double-wheeled double-furrow plow first appeared in various places in 1956, some people adopted the opposite attitude. Initially, they pointed fingers and made comments, and then completely negated the role of the double-wheeled double-furrow plow. From that time until the end of September last year, very few double-wheeled double-furrow plows were sold. Not only did paddy field areas not dare to use it, but even many areas in the North no longer vigorously promoted it. According to calculations by the agricultural department, if the currently stockpiled double-wheeled double-furrow plows were sold, and each plow cultivated one hundred mu of land, with each mu increasing grain production by ten jin, then the country could increase grain production by 846 million jin in one year.

    After comparing these two situations, we can clearly understand what attitude revolutionaries should hold towards new things. When new things first appear, people are not accustomed to them, and they inevitably have some shortcomings. The attitude to adopt is to care about it, protect it, help people become familiar with it, overcome its shortcomings, and make it more perfect. Ignoring it, even ridiculing it, and only pointing out its faults, is tantamount to stifling it.

    正确地对待新事物
    几年来，对待双轮双铧犁有两种不同的态度，也产生了不同的后果。
    有一种说法，认为双轮双铧犁在水田里不适用。浙江的同志不是这样想的。他们埋头苦干，作了许多试验和宣传，在水田中广泛运用双轮双铧犁耕作。现在，他们用事实向大家宣告：双轮双铧犁使水稻增产了，它在浙江许多地方扎了根，在广大农民和干部的思想中扎了根。
    当1956年双轮双铧犁刚在各地出现的时候，有一些人采取了与此相反的态度。他们初则指指点点、评头论足，继而全部否定了双轮双铧犁的作用。从那个时候起一直到去年9月底，双轮双铧犁销售出去的很少。不光水田地区不敢采用它，连北方不少地区也不再大力推广了。据农业部门计算，如果把现在积存的双轮双铧犁推销出去，按每部犁耕地一百亩、每亩增产粮食十斤计算，那末，在一年中间国家就可以增产粮食八亿四千六百万斤。
    比较了这两种情况之后，我们就可以明确地认识革命者对待新事物应该持什么样的态度。新事物刚出现的时候，人们不习惯它，它本身也难免有些缺点。应持的态度是关心它、保护它，帮助人们熟悉它，克服它的缺点，使它更加完善。漠视它，甚至嘲笑它，一味指责它，就等于扼杀它。
