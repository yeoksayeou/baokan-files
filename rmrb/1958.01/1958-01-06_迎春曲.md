    Spring Welcoming Song
    Wen Chengxun, Beijing Third Machine Tool Factory
    Difficulty follows difficulty
    Over-fulfillment follows over-fulfillment
    In the alternation of difficulty and over-fulfillment
    Five years pass in a flash.
    What are we thinking at this moment?
    This moment is filled with joy!
    At this year's end
    Singing beside the open-hearth furnace!
    Stubborn geese fly south in formation
    They are searching for warmth
    Lazy insects hibernate in the soil
    They are avoiding the cold
    Who envies you?
    Who feels sorry for you?
    We're not going anywhere, not idle for a moment
    Spring warmth and flowers blooming, then flowers blooming and spring warmth
    We welcome the second spring of our motherland!
    Forests, oil springs, coalfields, uranium mines
    How much energy can you store?
    The Party has surveyed 600 million hearts
    They contain infinitely noble ideals
    The Five-Year Plan is the plan to develop them
    Using its inexhaustible power
    To stir up huge waves of molten steel
    Let the blast furnace erupt like a volcano
        Wildly spewing molten iron…
    Listen!
    "Catch up with England in fifteen years"
    Echoes like spring thunder in the valley
    Echoes come from all directions:
    "We can catch up – we can catch up!"
    Look at the West:
    That country where "the sun never sets on the flag"
    Only has the afterglow of the setting sun left,
    Dusk is vast, the twilight years are bleak,
    Ah! Ah! The East
    From the Yangtze River, from Anshan Steel, from every farm
    Is emitting a myriad of rays
    Like frosty maple leaves, like pomegranate fire, like amber
    Crowding around the rising sun!

    迎春曲
    北京第三机床厂　温承训
    困难接着困难
    超额接着超额
    在困难和超额的变换中
    五年转瞬而过。
    此刻想着什么？
    此刻充满着欢乐！
    在这年终岁末
    站在马丁炉旁放歌！
    固执的大雁结队南飞
    它在找寻温暖
    懒惰的虫儿土里冬眠
    它在躲避风寒
    谁人对你们羡慕？
    谁人对你们伤感？
    那里也不去呀一刻也不闲
    春暖花开紧接着花开春暖
    我们迎接祖国第二个春天！
    林海、油泉、煤田、铀矿
    你又能储藏几许能量？
    党勘测了六万万座心房
    它蕴藏着无限高贵的理想
    五年计划就是开发它的计划
    用它不竭不尽的力量
    掀起钢水的巨浪
    让高炉像火山爆发
        狂喷着铁浆……
    听！
    “十五年后赶上英国”
    像春雷在山谷里轰响
    四面八方传来回声：
  “赶得上——赶得上！”
    你看西方：
    那“国旗不落日”的国家
    只剩下落日的残照，
    暮色苍茫晚景凄凉，
    啊！啊！东方
    从长江、从鞍钢、从每一座农场
    正射出万道霞光
    如霜枫、如榴火、如琥珀
    簇拥着初升的朝阳！
