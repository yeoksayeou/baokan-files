Notes

    The Smile on a Ghost's Face
    On January 10th, the Japanese Kyodo News Agency issued a commentary by Eizo Sugita, reviewing Eisenhower's "State of the Union Address." When discussing the "peace appeal" in the "State of the Union Address," the author said: because "the ghost face of striving to strengthen national defense is too terrible, it makes people wonder why the smile of appealing to others to cooperate in defending peace always feels temporary."
    The smile on a ghost's face, of course, becomes more and more hideous as it is put on. No wonder this Japanese commentator is so untrusting of the American president's "peace appeal."

    鬼脸上的微笑
    日本共同社10日发出杉田荣三的一篇评论，评艾森豪威尔的“国情咨文”。谈到“国情咨文”中的“和平呼吁”时，作者说：由于“努力加强国防的鬼脸太可怕了，使人不晓得为什么总是觉得吁请人家合作保卫和平的微笑是临时装出来的”。
    鬼脸上的微笑，当然是越装扮越狰狞。难怪这位日本评论家对美国总统的“和平呼吁”是那样地不相信。
