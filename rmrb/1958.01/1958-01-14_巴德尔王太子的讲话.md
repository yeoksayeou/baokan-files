Crown Prince Badr's Speech

Your Excellency Premier, Gentlemen:

Today I stand before you to pay my respects, to express my gratitude, and to bid farewell. After traveling throughout China, witnessing its vibrant vitality and sincere dedication to construction, and after engaging with Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, various ministers, and people from all walks of life, I find myself unable to adequately express the profound transformation in my feelings from the day I first arrived in this great and hospitable nation to this very moment!

Under these circumstances, I have come to recognize three distinct truths. I now wish to articulate the significance of these three truths here.

The first truth: The progress of this great people, as I have witnessed it, far surpasses anything I had heard, read, or previously imagined. In just a few short years, the Chinese people have built up heavy industry and achieved remarkable progress in national industrialization. Now, they are practically racing forward on the path of advancement. This is truly admirable and inspiring. The peoples of nations who have suffered under colonialism should take this lesson to heart: In the past, when China's affairs were controlled by colonialists, it was utterly impossible for China to accomplish the work of restoration that it has achieved today. If China had not shaken off colonial control and if its own loyal people could not be masters of their own house, it would not have realized all that it has achieved today.

The second truth: The sincere friendship and genuine desire for mutual cooperation that this ancient and great nation—China—extends to the Arab peoples fills us with joy and reassurance regarding the future of solidarity among the peoples of Asia, Africa, and all nations struggling for freedom and peace. In fact, all I have seen in the Chinese people I have encountered is a firm commitment to actively cooperate with the struggling peoples of Asia and Africa. They possess a correct and mature understanding of our common interests and common problems. Given this pervasive sentiment among this rising people, during my brief stay in China, I have not only forged precious friendships with the great leaders of this country but also strengthened the friendly cooperative relations between our two peoples. We have also reached a consensus on the necessity of continuing cooperation and strengthening the conditions for cooperation. Therefore, our relationship has progressed from a stage of spiritual sympathy to a stage of practical cooperation in culture, science, and economics. I believe that the treaties and agreements we have concluded will pave the way for better mutual understanding and broader cooperation. I believe these treaties and agreements fully express our understanding of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation.

The third truth: Peaceful coexistence among nations is the natural trend of international life, just as individuals, despite holding differing political and social views and inclinations, can still be friends. Peaceful coexistence accurately reflects the essence of international freedom and democracy in the lives of people. Therefore, those loyal to peaceful coexistence are opposed by colonialists, because colonialists are inherently opposed to freedom, goodness, and peace.

Now, as I bid farewell to the beloved Chinese people, I pay tribute to their struggle and express my gratitude for their wonderful hospitality and welcome. I will bid farewell to my friends, led by Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, who have assisted me in fulfilling the mission of friendship and cooperation between Yemen and China. I will not forget their fine efforts and pledge allegiance to the cause of freedom and peace, as they do. I will tell the people of Yemen that in China, they have loyal brothers who can be relied upon in their struggle, and the people of Yemen can join hands with these brothers on the path of freedom, cooperation, and peace.

### 巴德尔王太子的讲话

专栏：

    巴德尔王太子的讲话总理阁下，先生们：
    今天我站在你们面前向你们致敬，致谢辞别。在我游历了中国各地，看到了充沛的生命力和进行建设的真诚意志之后，在和毛泽东主席、周恩来总理和各位部长先生及各界人民进行了接触之后，我想，我无法向你们说明，在我刚刚来到这个伟大好客的国家的那天和今天这个时刻，我的心情发生了多么大的变化！
    在这种情况之下，我看清了三件事实。现在，我愿意在这里提出来说明这三件事实的伟大之处。
    第一件事实：我所看到的这个伟大人民的进步远远超过了我所听到读到的和我原来所想像的那种情况。在短短的几年里中国人民建设了重工业，在国家工业化方面有着惊人的发展，现在他们在前进的道路上几乎是向前奔驰，这是令人敬佩和兴奋的。遭受殖民主义者灾难的各国人民应该接受这个教训：那就是说，过去，当中国的事务操纵在殖民主义者手里的时候，中国绝无可能去完成今天所已完成的复兴工作，如果中国没有摆脱殖民主义者的控制，自己的忠诚的人民不能当家作主，它就不会实现今天所实现的这一切。
    第二件事实：那就是这个古老伟大的国家——中国对阿拉伯各国人民的真诚友谊和相互合作的真诚愿望，使我们对亚非人民以及所有为自由和平而斗争的各国人民的团结前途感到愉快和安心。事实上，在我接触过的中国各界人民身上所看到的只有同斗争中的亚非人民积极合作的坚决意志，他们对我们的共同利益和共同问题有着正确成熟的理解，对这个兴起的人民既然有着这种普遍的感情，所以我在中国停留的短暂的日子里，不仅同这个国家的伟大领导人物结下了珍贵的友谊，而且还加强了两国人民间的友好合作关系，并且一致认识到必须继续进行合作，加强合作的条件。因此我们的关系已经从精神上互相同情的阶段走上了在文化、科学和经济等各方面进行实际合作的阶段。我相信我们之间所缔结的一些条约和协定会为更好的互相谅解和更广泛的合作铺平道路。我相信这些条约和协定充分表达了我们对和平共处与国际合作的认识。
    第三件事实：那就是国际间的和平共处是国际生活的自然趋势，这正像个人与个人之间尽管有着不同的政治社会见解和倾向还是能够相互友好的。和平共处真实地说明了国际间的自由和人民生活中的民主实质，因此忠于和平共处的人民就遭到殖民主义者的反对，因为殖民主义者生来就是反对自由、善良和和平的。
    现在，在我辞别可爱的中国人民时，我向他们的斗争表示敬意，感谢他们美好的款待和欢迎。我将辞别以毛泽东主席、周恩来总理为首的朋友们，他们协助我完成了也中两国之间友好、合作的使命，我不会忘记他们的美好的努力，并以忠于自由与和平事业和他们相约。我将告诉也门人民，在中国有着在斗争中可以依靠的忠诚的弟兄，也门人民可以同他们的这些弟兄在自由、合作与和平的道路上携手前进。
