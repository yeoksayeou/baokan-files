Boldly Reform Unreasonable Rules and Regulations
    Qishuyan Power Plant Lowers Excessively High Bonus Rates Based on Mass Opinion

    (Our newspaper, Nanjing, January 30th, reporter Zhang Jing) The Qishuyan Power Plant in Changzhou recently launched a special debate on rectifying the reward system during the rectification movement. Through extensive airing of views, the broad masses of workers exposed many unreasonable phenomena in the past reward system, such as excessively high bonus rates, and the resulting contradictions in various aspects. In the spirit of starting from the 600 million people, the workers voluntarily proposed to lower the bonus rate for safe power supply; staff, engineers, technicians, guards, janitors, and cooks proposed not to take the safety bonus and the excess production bonus. The plant's leadership has revised the safety reward system based on mass opinion, effective from January.

    This plant has established some reward systems since 1951, according to the unified regulations of the superior authorities. Over the years, these systems have played a significant role in ensuring safe production and completing production plans. Equipment and personal accidents have decreased year by year. From 1950 to 1952, there were sixty-two major accidents, while in 1957, there were only two. In recent years, due to major repairs and improvements to machinery and equipment, as well as improved technical management, the possibility of accidents has been greatly reduced. Therefore, some of the contents of the safety bonus and excess production bonus stipulated a few years ago are no longer adapted to the needs of production. The plant's leadership promptly paid attention to this new contradiction and decided to take advantage of the rectification opportunity to mobilize the masses to solve this problem through debate.

    During the debate, the workers used a large number of facts to expose the current unreasonable phenomena of the safe power supply bonus and its adverse consequences. They are:

    First, the safety bonus rate is too high. The monthly bonus for workers in major production departments generally accounts for 30% of their original wages, and the safety bonus for engineers and technicians is as high as 40% to 45% of their original wages. For example, the technician Ni Xiangtao's monthly salary is 125 yuan. Calculated at a 45% bonus rate, his total monthly income is more than 181 yuan, which is higher than the factory director's salary. At the same time, due to the improvement of technical equipment conditions, and the reward standards have not been modified accordingly, an unreasonable situation has formed where the reward conditions are too low and the scope of reward is too wide. Workers don't need to put in much effort to get the bonus. By June last year, the number of people in the boiler plant who exceeded the highest safety record period accounted for 97.5% of the total number of people in the plant, and more than 70% of the workers in the automotive and electrical plants also exceeded it. The result of almost everyone being rewarded has made the bonus lose its positive role in encouraging advanced workers and stimulating production.

    Second, the bonus gap between various types of jobs is too large, which affects the unity between production workshops and auxiliary workshops, departments and workshops, and between this group of workers and that group of workers. For example, the boiler plant workers can get an average annual bonus of 325 yuan, while the operation workers can only get an average annual bonus of 53 yuan, a difference of five times. Technicians of the same level in the same grade can only get a 20% excess production bonus when working in the department, but they can get a 40% to 45% safety bonus every month when working in the workshop. Therefore, the bonus income of two fourth-grade technicians is 320 yuan different. As a result, technicians in the department are not content to work in the department, and technicians in the workshop are reluctant to leave the workshop. Situations of mutual buck-passing and mutual dissatisfaction often occur in production.

    Third, the high bonus rate and low reward conditions not only fail to promote production but also play a role in hindering it. In recent years, many employees have developed conservative ideas of being content with the status quo and sticking to conventions. Some workers are unwilling to make bold improvements in operation or technology in order to get more bonuses, and even if they clearly find problems, they do not take the initiative to solve them. Workers at the steam turbine plant watched the "Fanner Banting" leaking, preferring to record the situation and report it to the team leader rather than tightening it themselves, because they were afraid of causing problems and having their bonuses deducted. There is even a saying among the workers that "it is better to do less than to do more, and it is better not to do anything at all." This argument has greatly hindered progress in operation and technology.

    Fourth, due to the unreasonable reward system, it objectively contributed to the economicism and individualism of workers who only ask about the economy and not about politics, and who only care about personal immediate interests and not about the overall long-term interests. In the debate, various groups exposed many bad phenomena such as concealing accidents, evading responsibility, and wasting materials in order to get bonuses. Some workers, because they are satisfied with the easily obtained bonuses, have relatively weakened their enthusiasm for labor competitions. Because the conditions for advanced producers are high and the bonus is small, some workers even openly stated that they are unwilling to be advanced producers. Their reasons are: "Everything is good, but only two yuan; safety is good, and there are twenty yuan."

    The exposure of these facts has greatly shocked the thinking of all the employees in the plant. Many workers requested at group meetings to lower the plant's excessively high bonus rate. The driver Zhang Dequan used to get a bonus equal to 30% of his salary every month. This time, he proposed to lower the bonus rate to the same level as the lowest repair shop. He said: "Our technical level is originally included in the salary, and it is too unreasonable to get a higher bonus than others. The bonus should reward good labor, not high grades." Bu Fugen, director of the transportation workshop, resolutely demanded the cancellation of his bonus. He said: "I was just promoted from the workers. Although my position has changed, I still work like the workers. My salary is already higher than the workers. Wouldn't it be creating internal contradictions if I took too much bonus?"

    Now, the plant's leadership has revised the safety reward plan based on the opinions discussed by the masses. The reward conditions in the new plan are stricter, and the bonus rate has also been changed from a percentage to a fixed amount. The highest bonus is about 19 yuan per month, and the lowest is about 4 yuan. The new plan has been decided to be implemented from January. It is estimated that the plant's total bonus this year can be reduced by 50% compared with last year. The safety bonus alone can save the state 43,000 yuan a year.

### 大胆改革不合理的规章制度  戚墅堰电厂根据群众意见降低过高的奖金率

    大胆改革不合理的规章制度
    戚墅堰电厂根据群众意见降低过高的奖金率
    本报南京30日电　记者张竞报道：常州戚墅堰发电厂最近在整风运动中开展了一个整顿奖励制度的专题辩论。广大职工通过大鸣大放，揭发了过去奖励制度中奖金率过高等许多不合理的现象，以及由此而产生的各方面的矛盾。根据从六亿人口出发的精神，工人们自动提出要降低安全供电奖的奖金率；职员、工程技术人员、警卫员、勤杂工、炊事员，提出要不拿安全奖和超额奖。这个厂的领导方面已经根据群众意见修订了安全奖励制度，从1月份开始实行。
    这个厂从1951年开始，根据上级机关的统一规定，建立了一些奖励制度。几年来，这些制度对保证安全生产、完成生产计划起了不小的作用。设备和人身事故逐年减少，1950年到1952年发生重大事故六十二次，1957年只发生了两次。近年来，由于机器设备经过了大修和改进，同时技术管理水平有了提高，发生事故的可能性已经大大减少。因此，几年前规定的安全奖和超额奖的某些内容已经不能适应生产的需要。这个厂的领导人员及时注意了这个新的矛盾，决定趁整风的时机，发动群众通过辩论来解决这一问题。
    在辩论中，职工们用大量事实揭发了目前安全供电奖的不合理现象和它所引起的不良后果。它们是：
    第一、安全奖奖金率过高，主要生产部门的工人每月的奖金一般占原工资的30％，工程技术人员的安全奖竟高达原工资的40％到45％。如技师倪湘涛每月工资一百二十五元，奖金率按45％计算，全月收入就有一百八十一元多，比厂长的工资还高。同时，由于技术设备条件改善，而奖励标准没有作相应的修改，已经形成了受奖条件过低，受奖面过宽的不合理情况。职工不需要用多大的努力就可以拿到奖金。到去年6月为止，锅炉场超过最高安全纪录期的人就占全场总人数的97.5％，汽车场、电气场的工人也超过70％以上。这样几乎人人受奖的结果，反而使奖金失掉了鼓励先进、刺激生产的积极作用。
    第二、各类工种的奖金悬殊太大，影响了生产车间同辅助车间、科室同车间、这部分工人同那部分工人之间的团结。如锅炉场工人一年平均可得奖金三百二十五元，而运转工人一年平均只得奖金五十三元，高低相差五倍之多。同样水平同样等级的技术员，在科室工作，一季只能拿到20％的超额奖，如果在车间工作，每月就可以拿到40％到45％的安全奖。因此，同样两个四级技术员，奖金收入竟相差三百二十元。结果科室的技术员不安心科室工作，车间的技术人员也不肯调离车间。生产中互相推诿、互不服气的情况也常有发生。
    第三、奖金率偏高，奖励条件过低，不仅不能促进生产，反而起了促退作用。近年来，不少职工产生了安于现状、墨守成规的保守思想。有些工人为了多得奖金，不愿意在操作上或技术上作大胆的改进，甚至明明发现了问题，也不主动去解决。汽机场的工人眼看着“凡而拌根”漏气，宁可把情况记下来向班长汇报，也不肯动手去拧一拧，原因是怕弄出毛病来扣奖金。在工人中甚至流传着“多动不如少动，少动不如不动”的论调，这种论调大大阻碍了操作上和技术上的进步。
    第四、由于奖励制度不合理，在客观上便助长了工人中只问经济不问政治、只顾个人眼前利益不顾整体长远利益的经济主义思想和个人主义思想。在辩论中，各小组揭发了不少为了得奖金而隐瞒事故、逃避责任、浪费材料等不良现象。有些工人因为满足于轻易得来的奖金，便相对地减弱了对劳动竞赛的热情。因为先进生产者条件高，奖金少，有些工人甚至公开表示不愿作先进生产者。他们的理由是：“样样好，不过两块钱；安全好，就有二十块。”
    这些事实的揭露，使全厂职工的思想受到了很大的震动。许多工人都在小组会上要求把本厂偏高的奖金率拉下来。司机张德泉过去每月能够拿到占工资30％的奖金，这次他提出要把奖金率降到同最低的修配工场一样。他说：“我们的技术水平本来就包括在工资里了，再拿比别人高的奖金就太不合理了。奖金应该奖励劳动好的，而不是奖励等级高的。”运输工场主任卜甫根坚决要求取消自己的奖金。他说：“我刚从工人中提拔起来，职位虽然变了，但我还是和工人一样劳动。我的工资已经比工人高了，再过多地拿奖金，岂不是制造内部矛盾吗？”
    现在，这个厂的领导方面已经根据群众讨论的意见，修订了安全奖励方案。新方案中的奖励条件严格了，奖金率也改百分比为现金额，最高的奖金每月约十九元，最低的约四元。新的方案已经决定从1月份开始实行。估计全厂今年奖金可以比去年减少50％，仅安全奖一项，一年就可以为国家节约四万三千元。
