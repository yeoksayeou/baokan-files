    Xinhua News Agency, Prague. Czechoslovak industrial production is expected to increase by 8.9% this year. Among them, means of production will increase by 9.5%, and consumer goods will increase by 8%. This was mentioned by Karel, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, in an article published in the latest issue of "Party Life" magazine.

    When talking about the tasks of this year's national plan, Korel pointed out that the main task in the industrial field is to meet the increased demand for fuel and to meet the demand for artificial fertilizers due to the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement.

    Korel also said that the national plan stipulates that a total of 118,000 workers will be added this year, of which 92,000 will work in the production field. It is necessary to transfer a large number of workers to departments such as construction, coal mines, transportation, and remote areas.

    This year, industrial labor productivity will increase by 5.2%. The average wage of the entire economic sector will increase slightly. He emphasized that the increase in labor productivity and the growth of average wages must maintain a certain relationship.

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw. According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, Polish Minister of Agriculture Ochab recently spoke at the Parliamentary Agriculture Committee, talking about Poland's agricultural situation last year and the tasks of agriculture this year.

    Ochab said that Poland's agricultural situation last year was generally good. Agricultural production increased by nearly 4% last year, slightly more than the growth expected in the national economic plan. Farmers' incomes have increased due to the increase in products supplied to the market.

    Ochab pointed out that approximately 10,700 agricultural groups have been established in agricultural areas, with more than 300,000 members.

    Two hundred and ninety-three agricultural production cooperatives that had been dissolved in the past have been restored. In addition, sixty-four new agricultural cooperatives have been established. There are currently 1,724 agricultural cooperatives in the country.

    捷克斯洛伐克工业继续增长
    今年主要任务是发展燃料和人造肥料工业
    波兰去年农业产量增加，合作社有发展
    据新华社布拉格电　捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产今年预计要增加8.9％。其中生产资料将增加9.5％，消费品将增加8％。这是捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会书记科列尔在最近一期“党的生活”杂志上发表的文章中谈到的。
    科列尔在谈到今年的国家计划的任务时指出，工业方面的主要任务是要满足对燃料的更多的要求，满足由于农业合作化运动的发展对人造肥料的要求。
    科列尔还说，国家计划规定今年总共要增加十一万八千名工人，其中有九万二千人将在生产领域中工作。有必要把大批工人转移到建筑、煤矿、运输等部门以及边远地区去工作。
    今年，工业劳动生产率将提高5.2％。整个经济部门的平均工资将略有增加。他强调指出，劳动生产率的提高和平均工资的增长要保持一定的关系。
    据新华社华沙电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰农业部长奥哈布最近在议会农业委员会上发表讲话，谈到了波兰去年农业情况和今年农业方面的任务。
    奥哈布说，波兰去年的农业情况整个说来是好的。农业产量在去年增加了将近4％，略多于国民经济计划预计增长的数字。由于供市场出售的产品的增加，农民的收入增加了。
    奥哈布指出，在农业地区已经成立了大约一万零七百个农业小组，它们拥有三十万以上的组员。
    过去解散了的农业生产合作社已经有二百九十三个恢复过来。此外，还新建了六十四个农业合作社。目前全国共有一千七百二十四个农业合作社。
    奥哈布指出，今年国家对农民的贷款将达十七亿二千五百万兹罗提，去年是十三亿六千万兹罗提。同去年相比，供应农村的建筑材料也将进一步增加。
