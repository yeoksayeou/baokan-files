Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 14th: French Communist Party Secretary Jacques Duclos published an article in "l'Humanité" on January 14th, exposing the French government's intention to revise the constitution and electoral law in the National Assembly.

    Duclos said that the reactionaries intend to establish a system through constitutional amendments that would allow bills approved by a minority of parliamentarians to be considered passed, thus allowing the cabinet to continue to govern with minority support under the same circumstances. This clearly exposes their desire to eliminate the parliamentary system and reduce democratic freedoms to nothing. However, this attempt is doomed to failure if it is not supported by the leaders of the Socialist Party. But because they are involved in this plot, it creates an extremely serious danger.

    Duclos pointed out that the cabinet's proposal to amend the constitution strengthens the Prime Minister's power to dissolve the parliament in order to use the dissolution of parliament as blackmail to force parliamentarians to submit. Gaillard is trying to create a situation where parliamentarians are constantly worried about the dissolution of parliament, thus turning them into mere servants supporting government policy.

    Duclos concluded by saying that the government and its majority party, precisely because they fear the outcome of universal suffrage, are attempting to amend the constitution and the electoral system at the same time, in order to turn the election into a fraud, steal the Communist Party's seats, and illegally transfer most of these seats to reactionary parties. Duclos called on the people of the whole country to fight back against this plan of the reactionaries.

    法国政府企图消灭议会制度
    杜克洛号召人民予以反击
    据新华社巴黎14日电　法国共产党书记杜克洛14日在“人道报”上发表文章，揭露法国政府企图要国民议会修改宪法和选举法的打算。
    杜克洛说，反动派打算通过修改宪法来建立这样一种制度：使得由少数议员投票赞成的法案被认为已经通过，因而在同样的情况下，内阁得以在少数支持下继续执政。这突出地暴露出他们一心想消灭议会制度，使民主自由化为乌有。但是，如果社会党的领导人不加以支持，这种企图是注定要失败的。可是因为他们参与这种图谋，这就造成了极其严重的危险。
    杜克洛指出，内阁在提出的修改宪法草案中所以要加强内阁总理解散议会的权力，是要用解散议会作为讹诈手段，来迫使议员们俯首贴耳。盖伊阿试图造成这样一种局面：使议员们经常担心解散议会，从而使他们变成只是支持政府政策的效劳者。
    杜克洛最后说，政府和它的多数党正是由于害怕普选的结果，所以企图一面修改宪法、一面修改选举制度，以便使选举成为骗局，窃夺共产党的议席，而非法地把这些议席的大部分交给反动党派。杜克洛号召全国人民对反动派的这种打算予以反击。
