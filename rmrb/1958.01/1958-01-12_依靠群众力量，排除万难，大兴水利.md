Relying on the Power of the Masses, Overcoming All Difficulties, and Vigorously Developing Water Conservancy
The CPC Hubei Provincial Committee

Guanghua and Jun Counties in the Xiangyang Special District of Hubei Province took the lead in accumulating some important experiences in water conservancy construction and achieved remarkable results in converting dry land into paddy fields. Since September 1957, driven by these two counties, a massive upsurge in water conservancy construction has been set off in the special district. In order to study their experience and promote the development of the water conservancy construction movement throughout the province, Comrade Wang Yanchun, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, led some county party secretaries to visit Guanghua and Jun Counties in late September. After listening to the report, the Provincial Party Committee believed that their experience was very important and should be further promoted. On November 9, a Xiangyang Special District Water Conservancy Delegation, headed by Comrade Wang Renzhong, consisting of the first secretaries of five district party committees, thirty-five county party secretaries, and some responsible comrades from provincial departments, was organized to visit the area. Because the Provincial Party Congress was to be held in late November and time was tight, they mainly visited Guanghua and Jun Counties, and only briefly looked at other counties such as Xiangyang, Zhaoyang, Sui, and Gucheng. After the visit, comrades from various places generally reflected that they were greatly inspired, their minds were liberated, their horizons were broadened, they found the key, and their confidence was enhanced. It was a very vivid lesson for everyone. While looking at what others were doing, they thought about their own situation and realized that their original water conservancy plans were too conservative and did not break out of the old mold. Before returning, they each considered revising their original plans. The Xiaogan District Party Committee immediately called on responsible comrades from the district party committee to lead some main cadres from districts and townships to visit as well.

A brief report on the situation learned from this visit is as follows:

Years of Exploration Led to Some Detours

In the past, most areas of the Xiangyang Special District were low-yielding areas in the province. Before 1954, the average grain yield per mu in the district was only about 200 jin, and the cotton yield per mu was only more than 10 jin. The low yield was due to the large number of mountains and hills, the low rainfall, and the poor water conservancy conditions, especially the lack of paddy fields. The district had more than 15 million mu of cultivated land, a population of more than 5.1 million, but only more than 3 million mu of paddy fields. In the event of drought, hundreds of thousands of mu could not be planted with rice seedlings. For example, Guanghua County had 740,000 mu of cultivated land, but only 6,000 mu of paddy fields before liberation. Jun County had 710,000 mu of cultivated land, but only 95,000 mu of paddy fields before collectivization. Other counties generally had fewer paddy fields, and dry land yields were historically very low, with some yielding 200 jin and others only a few dozen jin. The people's lives were very hard, and sweet potatoes were the main food. A popular saying describing their lives was: "Bang, bang, bang in the morning (cutting sweet potatoes), relying on steaming sweet potatoes at noon, changing the meal for dinner, but still sweet potato soup." Since collectivization, various measures have been taken to try to change the face of low yields. After three years of exploration, cadres and the masses unanimously believed that the basic method was to vigorously develop water conservancy and convert dry land into paddy fields and irrigated land. Especially in areas with very few paddy fields, such as Jun and Guanghua Counties, this demand was even more urgent. Initially, their attention was more focused on the construction of large and medium-sized reservoirs. Since suffering from a severe drought in 1952, some large, medium, and small reservoirs have been built, achieving certain results. However, due to the large scale of the reservoir projects and the large investment, they could not be built universally, and it was not easy to form a mass movement. At the same time, the local rainfall was relatively low, which also affected the water storage capacity of the reservoirs, making it difficult to achieve the planned irrigation area. Some places even built dry reservoirs. As Chen Yuwen, Secretary of the Jun County Party Committee, said: "In the past, we always wanted to build large and medium-sized reservoirs, concentrating several water conservancy technicians from the county to conduct surveys everywhere and prepare many reports. Either the design was not thorough, or the investment was too large, and it was restricted by financial resources, so the higher authorities could not approve it. The county concentrated its own strength to grasp one project, putting most of its strength into it, with the county head and district heads involved, mobilizing labor from several districts, dragging its feet, and spending a lot of money, but not much land was converted, and the masses who could not benefit were very dissatisfied. The saying 'The government builds ponds, the masses help' was circulating among the masses. Large ones could not be built in large numbers, and small ones were not successful." How to further develop the water conservancy construction movement? Everyone has been exploring for several years.

Jun County Party Committee Supports Li Daguai's Initiative

During this period, Comrade Li Daguai, Director of the Mingxing No. 1 Cooperative in Jun County, broke through many difficulties and created the experience of diverting river water to the hillside. When they were in mutual aid teams and about to establish primary cooperatives, they successively converted 15 mu of river滩 land into paddy fields, with a yield of 701 jin per mu, initially realizing their desire to eat rice, which inspired the masses' demand for land conversion. However, due to their weak strength, they could not do much. When the primary cooperative was established in 1954 and expanded to 38 households, how to change the face of low yields was still a difficult problem. There was a folk song in the area: "The most sinful thing is Li Jiawan, with barren mountains behind the bay and river滩 in front of the bay, either dry or flooded, unable to eat enough or wear warm clothes." In order to change this situation, Comrade Li Daguai repeatedly studied and believed that the only way out was to convert dry land into paddy fields. Based on past experience, he boldly proposed a plan to divert river water to the hillside and convert the hillside dry land into paddy fields. Chen Yuwen, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, supported him. In the cooperative, with the exception of a few who agreed, most of the members were afraid of difficulties and raised various concerns. Some people sarcastically sang: "Singing a song, singing a song, how can stones roll uphill from the river?" Yang Jicheng, 59, said: "Wanting to divert river water to the hillside is like pulling a boat on dry land, just fooling around!" Others said: "If Li Daguai can divert river water to Li Jiawan, I will change my surname." His father and wife also couldn't understand, saying: "No one has dared to do this since our ancestors. You're just daydreaming!" Regardless of all opposition and criticism, Li Daguai racked his brains day and night to find the trick to divert river water to the hillside. Based on the principle of aiming when shooting as a militiaman, he used a two-foot-long bamboo tube with the nodes removed, placed it on a bowl filled with water, and lay on the ground to look at the opposite side. He found that the place where the river water flowed on the opposite side was higher than the terrain of Li Jiawan, confirming that a canal could be opened to divert water. At the same time, he patiently guided the masses to calculate the cost of building the canal and the increase in production from land conversion, dispelling the masses' concerns about wasting their work for nothing. At this time, more people were on his side. However, there were still some people who couldn't understand. He adopted a method of adapting to each individual, forming a special team of people who actively supported the canal construction, and assigning those who did not understand the ideology to do other work in the cooperative. After nine days of effort, a 385-meter-long canal was finally opened, and the river water was diverted to the hillside of Li Jiawan for the first time. When the water flowed by the side of their houses, the masses happily said: "In the future, the water tanks at home will be useless and can be turned into vegetable tanks." Li Zhengdao, a 75-year-old blind man, leaned on his crutches to touch the canal water and said with emotion: "In the past, landlords had money and power, but they couldn't build canals. Now that we have cooperatives, the Communist Party has brought river water to our Li Jiawan." That year, 30 mu of paddy fields were converted, with a yield of 690 jin per mu. After this shot was fired, they continued to build three long canals and two large ponds in 1955 and 1956. The cooperative expanded to 138 households. In the past, there were only 62 mu of paddy fields, but at this time it increased to more than 600 mu, with an average of more than 4 mu of paddy fields per household. The masses excitedly said: "In the past, Zhang and Li's two bays were bare, but now we live in the middle of the fields; the barren slopes of our ancestors have become golden rice fields." Those who couldn't understand in the past now understand; those who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative now don't want to withdraw. They have even greater enthusiasm for water conservancy construction and plan to build four more weirs and canals, two ponds, and three small reservoirs this winter and spring. After completing these projects, 1,540 mu of dry land in the cooperative can be converted into paddy fields. 700 mu can be completed before spring plowing, more than doubling the original paddy fields. They strive to reach 2,300 mu by 1962, increasing from 7 fen of paddy fields per person to 2.8 mu. By 1964, they plan to reach 3,000 mu of paddy fields. At that time, except for 220 mu of dry land that cannot be converted, the entire cooperative will be paddy fields, with an average of 3.6 mu per person. If the paddy fields are calculated at a yield of 700 jin of grain per mu, the cooperative can increase its output from the current 590,000 jin to 2.1 million jin, an increase of more than two times, with an average of more than 2,500 jin of grain per person.

Li Daguai's initiative to divert river water uphill received the active support of the County Party Committee, which vigorously promoted his experience. In the two years of 1955 and 1956, Jun County converted more than 35,000 mu of paddy fields using similar methods.

Guanghua County Developed Jun County's Experience

At the same time, neighboring Guanghua County absorbed and developed Jun County's experience. Guanghua originally had fewer paddy fields than Jun County, smaller rivers, less labor, and the people's lives were very hard. After collectivization in 1956, they had been looking for ways to convert paddy fields, and conducted paddy field conversion experiments in plains, low-lying areas, hillsides, and hilly areas, converting a total of 6,000 mu, all of which were successful, with yields reaching more than 600 jin per mu, breaking the various concerns of cadres and the masses that land could not be converted. However, whether the water supply was sufficient was still an unresolved issue. The Liuhe Cooperative of Zhaogang Township in the county planned to block nine mountain gullies and build nine small reservoirs in the winter of 1956, converting 500 mu of land. After a winter of construction, spending more than 20,000 workdays, five small reservoirs were built. However, because there was no rain all winter, the reservoirs were still dry when it was time to transplant rice seedlings in 1957. The masses discussed: "Don't talk about 500 mu, it looks like 5 mu can't be converted." What to do? Inspired by the Yonggu Cooperative's diversion of river water into canals, the members proposed opening a 13-li-long canal at the Dicao River Sluice 壋 to divert river water to the hillside from afar, with the canal winding through the mountains. As a result, it only took more than 4,000 workdays to build the canal. 420 mu of paddy fields (including more than 200 mu of barren slopes) were converted when it was almost time to harvest wheat. When the canal passed near an originally dry reservoir, water was diverted into the reservoir, filling it up, further inspiring their idea of "canals and reservoirs connected, storing water year-round, and using water during busy times." Using this method, after a comprehensive calculation, the county only needed to make full use of every drop of water, and the water supply would still be sufficient. Originally, it was thought that after building dams in the upper reaches of the river, the water volume in the lower reaches would be greatly reduced. Everyone was worried: Can dams be built below after dams are built above? The actual situation broke this concern. After blocking it above, the water flowed again in the river not far away, and it could be built below as well. Twenty-five river-blocking dams were built on the Dicao River, and twenty-five long canals were opened, and the water at the last river-blocking dam was still not reduced. Based on practical experience, they found the key to solving the problem and proposed a method of "comprehensive survey, unified planning, blocking water section by section, opening canals on the mountainside, diverting water from afar, irrigating fields nearby, connecting canals and weirs, storing water year-round, and using water during busy times." Under the policy of "relying on the masses to manage water conservancy diligently and frugally," they tried every means to make use of river water, spring water, groundwater, and mountain stream water as much as possible to form a comprehensive gravity irrigation system. Their slogan was: "Water conservancy collectivization." The masses said: "Open mountains when encountering mountains, cross water when encountering water, and socialism goes wherever water goes." Under the in-depth leadership of the County Party Committee, the water conservancy work took a big step forward in the drought resistance movement in 1957, and a climax had already formed during winter sowing. As of October, the county had completed 1,437 projects, converting more than 53,000 mu of land. The county has changed from an average of one fen of paddy fields per household to one mu of paddy fields per household. Because they have already gained relatively complete experience, and there are examples of land conversion and increased production everywhere, cadres and the masses are full of energy. Encouraged by the slogan "Eat Rice," every agricultural cooperative strives to tap potential and think of ways to overcome difficulties to develop water conservancy. The County Party Committee originally planned to convert 70,000 mu of land from the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958. In the large-scale mass water management movement, the plan has been broken through again and again. So far, the plan has been raised to convert 250,000 mu of paddy fields and 50,000 mu of irrigated land, a total of 300,000 mu. The original plan was to convert 450,000 mu of land in the county by 1967. Now it seems that it can be completed ahead of schedule in two or three years. In this way, Guanghua can be transformed from a dry land county to a paddy field county, and from a low-yield county to a high-yield county. By 1962, there is confidence in increasing the yield per mu from 300 jin to 600 jin.

Xiangyang Prefectural Party Committee Timely Promotes Guanghua County's Experience

The Xiangyang Prefectural Party Committee attached great importance to Guanghua County's successful experience, and timely organized comrades from various counties to visit, which played a great role in promoting the entire region. Everyone believes that Guanghua's conditions are worse than those in other places, and what Guanghua can do should also be done in other places. After returning from the visit, each county conducted in-depth investigations based on local conditions, and fully mobilized the masses to revise the original plan. In a short period of time, a climax of water conservancy construction has formed in the entire special district. Not only are small-scale water conservancy projects generally undertaken by the masses themselves, but also many large and medium-sized projects with larger scales are also self-managed by the masses, with the government providing leadership and assistance. Zhaoyang County built two canals of more than 200 li in length and a reservoir irrigating 20,000 mu, without spending much money, only with the government subsidizing 60,000 yuan and the masses raising 30,000 yuan themselves. The situation in other counties is also similar. "Self-raising, self-management, self-management" has become a mass slogan, and even children over ten years old know how to talk about this principle. Jun County originally created a lot of experience in water conservancy construction. Under the inspiration and promotion of Guanghua, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses has been further enhanced. The water conservancy plan for this year has been revised three times in a few months, from the original plan to convert 40,000 mu of land to 70,000 mu, striving to complete 95,000 mu. Before winter sowing, it was originally planned to complete the conversion of 20,000 mu of land, and 25,000 mu has already been completed.

At the end of December, in Xiangyang Special District, each county put 1.5 million laborers into water conservancy projects every day, and the mountains and fields were full of people building canals and opening mountains. The original plan for the Xiangyang Special District from the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958, after repeated revisions, determined to convert 1.5 million mu of paddy fields (including 1.14 million mu of reclamation), 800,000 mu of irrigated land, a total of 2.3 million mu (in fact, the following plan is even larger than this number). In addition, it can increase the area of guaranteed harvest land and improve the irrigation area by 1.5 million mu. It is expected that the entire region will increase production by another 800 million jin in 1958 on the basis of 4 billion jin of grain production in 1957. They have only converted 740,000 mu of paddy fields in the two years since collectivization; after this plan is completed, it will develop to 1.5 million mu in one winter and spring, more than doubling the achievements of two years, greatly taking a leap forward. As the masses said: "Now that we have cooperatives, we can do things in one year that we couldn't do in the past few generations."

The experience of Xiangyang Special District in water conservancy construction can be summarized as follows:

Using the Conditions of Collectivization to Break with Conventions

1. On the basis of collectivization, break with the past conventions and fully utilize river water to connect the previously scattered and isolated canals, weirs, ponds, and reservoirs into a complete and comprehensive gravity irrigation system—the watermelon vine-style water conservancy system. By doing so, first, the large amount of useless water that was usually lost in the rivers and streams is diverted to the hillside, so that various terrains such as hillsides, hills, and plains can benefit from irrigation, and a large amount of dry land can be converted into paddy fields, changing the past situation of "relying on the sky for rain on hillsides." Second, because the canals and ponds are connected, the fields are irrigated when needed, and the ponds are irrigated when idle, the water storage capacity is greatly expanded, breaking the old dogma that one flow can only irrigate 10,000 mu. Because that calculation method only calculates from the flow that can be supplied during water use, without considering that storing the amount of water that is usually lost can expand the irrigation area by more than ten times. Solving this problem is a very important key in those areas with very small rivers. For example, the Dicao River in Guanghua County is 50 li long, with a flow rate of only 0.06 cubic meters per second, which can only irrigate 600 mu according to past calculation methods. Now, they have built 25 dams on the upper and lower reaches of this river and opened 25 canals, with a total length of 103 li, which can irrigate 9,900 mu, expanding it by more than 15 times. If flood control is added, the irrigation area will be expanded even more. According to their experience, in the future, some ponds and weirs should be built on both sides of the canals of large and medium-sized reservoirs, according to local conditions, so that the reservoirs can play a greater role. Third, because water is diverted from high places and far away places, changing pumping and waterwheels to gravity irrigation, it greatly saves manpower and financial resources, and solves many problems that could not be solved in the past. In the past, wanting to use river water always thought of building pumping stations and building large river-blocking dams, which would cost millions of yuan at every turn and require many tons of steel and cement, which was difficult to do. Now, using this method, a large number of water conservancy projects can be self-managed by the masses. According to their experience, damming and diverting water should generally be done first for tributaries and then for main streams, first for small rivers and then for large rivers. Because tributaries and small rivers are always higher in terrain and easier to divert water, the projects are also smaller, easier, and less dangerous. Although opening long canals also takes a lot of work, as long as there is some technical guidance, the masses can manage it themselves. The problem to pay attention to when opening canals is that the main canal cannot "bow its head" (that is, it cannot "fall water," and the slope should be less than one-thousandth), and the water should always be diverted from high places, so that hillsides and hills can be irrigated. One "bowing head" will reduce its efficiency. Doing so also has greater flexibility. The canal can be built to where it irrigates, and it can be temporarily stopped if there is not enough strength, and extended in the future.

Relying on the Masses, Managing Water Conservancy Diligently and Frugally

2. Implement the policy of relying on the masses and managing water conservancy diligently and frugally. In the past, many places were not clear enough on this issue and always wanted to ask the higher authorities for more money. Technical cadres were also keen on doing large and decent projects. Some people have the idea of ​​"the government builds ponds, and the masses help." Many problems are difficult to solve. Now they clearly stipulate the policy of focusing on small-scale projects. Under unified planning, the masses are called upon to self-raise, self-repair, self-use, and self-manage. The construction of the project is handed over to the masses for discussion, and the masses themselves decide to do it, and the situation has completely changed. Things that used to cost a lot of money can now be done without spending money or spending very little money. For example, the Xianrendu Township Hujiawa Reservoir in Guanghua County was invested by the government the year before last, costing 35,000 yuan, and only irrigating 300 mu of land. This year, the Happiness Cooperative in the county built a similar project by themselves, also irrigating 300 mu of land. The government did not give a penny, and the cooperative only spent more than 3 yuan on lamp oil. This year, the county built a total of projects that can irrigate more than 50,000 mu of land, and only used more than 20,000 yuan of national loans. The Xiangyang Special District has 42 large-scale projects invested by the state. Through mass discussions, 3.18 million yuan was saved, and 12 more projects with benefits of more than 10,000 mu were built. For things that the masses can do, they will try their best to save expenses, save what can be saved, and replace what can be replaced, and are unwilling to spend more money or ask for more national loans. For example, when the Huohua Cooperative in Liuliping District of Jun County planned to build a long canal across the cliff, the technical cadres said that it would cost more than 100,000 jin of cement and thousands of jin of explosives, which would not be enough even if all the grain harvested by the cooperative in three years was used. Zhu Qingxi, the director of the cooperative, came up with various methods to save money. At the beginning, he did not know how to blast the stone cliff, so he hired a blaster and squatted beside him to learn. After seeing a few explosions, he learned it himself and no longer hired people. Originally, the drill for chiseling stones had to be returned to the furnace every time it was used, costing 10 cents each time; he went to the blacksmith shop to see how they made it, and came back and set up a bellows at the construction site and did it himself. It not only saved money but also saved time. When the channel passed through a cliff and the problem of water storage was difficult to solve, he asked an old stonemason for advice and used the method of building the channel body with stones and filling the channel core with yellow soil instead of cement. Other small tools are replaced by earthen methods as much as possible. As a result, only 290 jin of gunpowder, 200 jin of cement, 3,370 workdays, and 520 yuan were used to build a 2,530-meter-long channel across the mountainside, making more than 100 mu of land guaranteed to harvest, and newly converting 54 mu of paddy fields. There are countless such active examples. Their slogan is "Use poor methods to change the poor face." Not only are small projects completely self-managed, but now batches of medium-sized projects are also mostly self-managed by the masses. They also want to gradually achieve that the channel projects of large reservoirs do not require government investment and are completely borne by the masses themselves. In this way, the goal of large scale, less money, quick results, and more benefits can be truly achieved.

When relying on the masses to self-manage water conservancy, it is important to correctly implement the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. The general methods they take are: democratic agreements, apportioning investment and labor according to the amount of benefited land; those who benefit more pay more, those who benefit less pay less, and reasonable compensation is given to places that do not benefit. If a national loan is needed, it is stipulated that it must be repaid in installments. Tools should be made from local materials as much as possible and self-made and self-used. Small tools are all brought by the members themselves and repaired uniformly by the cooperative. When construction starts, according to the size of the project, the cooperative, team, and section are contracted, and remuneration is calculated on a piece-rate basis. The members reflected: "When you do it this way, you have a bottom line in your heart, and the hoe goes down hard, otherwise your heart will be soft and your hands will be soft." Solving the mutual benefit problem and the contracting problem has accelerated the progress of the project and guaranteed the quality.

Ideological Work Runs Through to the End

3. Follow the mass line and carry out ideological mobilization from beginning to end. Where there is no communication, there is debate. The construction process of each project is a process of fierce struggle between advanced ideology and conservative ideology. People who do not understand the ideology either say "one side of the water and soil feeds one side of people, born to eat sweet potato mouths, don't think about eating rice," or say "if the land could be converted, the old generation would have converted it long ago, and they would still wait for you, do you think you are capable?" Others are worried that digging off the "dragon vein," losing the "ground energy," destroying the "feng shui," or offending the "煞太岁" will cause disasters. When encountering difficulties, all kinds of strange words come out, and even gamble with "cutting off heads and digging out eyes." When the Lianhe Cooperative of Jihonggang Township in Guanghua County opened the canal, some members did not believe that the water could come over, and compared Wu Qingshan, the district cadre who led the canal opening, to Qin Shihuang; later, when the canal was opened and the water came over, they praised him as "Bai Niangniang flooding Jinshan Temple." The way to solve ideological problems is to visit, calculate accounts, and debate. More importantly, leading cadres and party and league activists take the lead and listen to the opinions of the masses with an open mind, and concentrate the wisdom of the masses. Especially when encountering difficulties and some people's ideas are shaken, the determination of leading cadres plays a decisive role. When the Mingxing No. 4 Cooperative in Jun County was repairing the Dongzi Weir, it had to pass through a cliff in the middle, which was impossible to construct. Most of the masses were discouraged and said, "Wanting to break through this cliff is like wanting to eat human flesh." In this case, Comrade Zhang Renchang, the director of the cooperative, did not waver at all and did not go back late at night, but stayed by the cliff to think of a way. This spirit deeply moved the masses, and they finally came up with a way to hang people on ropes to operate on the half-cliff, which was personally done by the Communist Youth League members, and the cliff was broken through. These kinds of heroic deeds and heroic figures are now emerging in batches in various places, giving the masses a powerful education with vivid facts, and greatly improving the masses' confidence in transforming nature. Many cadres have changed their past style of forced orders.

Cadres Learn Technology,
Climbing Over Mountains and Leading by Example

4. Leading cadres take action and everyone learns technology. They adopted the leadership method of unified leadership, dividing the work into sections, and grasping the key points at all levels. Each responsible comrade personally led township and cooperative cadres to climb over mountains and search for water sources, and loudly put forward the slogan of "not letting go of a stream of water, not letting go of a good terrain." County, district, township, and cooperative levels formulated their own plans, each with its own key points, and visited, compared, exchanged experiences, learned from each other, and promoted each other at any time. Everyone was full of energy and afraid of falling behind. In particular, the work style of the cadres has undergone a fundamental change. From surveying and designing to construction, they have worked with the masses from beginning to end, greatly close the relationship between cadres and the masses, boosting the morale of the masses, and also enriching the leadership experience. After the full development of the movement, a big problem is that the technical force cannot keep up. Generally, each county has only a dozen technicians, and most of them are new students, and they do not know much. The only way is to learn by yourself. The Guanghua County Party Committee took the lead in listening to technical cadres' lectures, called on all cadres to learn technology, combined listening to lectures with field practice, and required those engaged in agricultural technology to have a preliminary understanding of water conservancy technology, and selected a group of people from the cooperatives to train. After taking a series of measures, Guanghua County has now trained more than 700 farmer technicians. They have a rough understanding of water conservancy knowledge, and they can do small-scale projects themselves. Cadres at all levels also have a rough understanding of water conservancy technology. Many cadres carry a small level and can measure the terrain themselves and put forward opinions on design and construction, and conscientiously implement the principle of combining leading cadres, technicians, and the masses.

Played a Huge Role in Promoting the Whole Province

Visiting the water conservancy construction in Xiangyang Special District has played a huge role in promoting the water conservancy movement throughout the province. After on-site inspections, comrades from various places also exchanged experiences at the Provincial Party Congress. According to the National Agricultural Development Outline (Revised Draft) and the production increase targets proposed by the Provincial Party Committee, they re-formulated the province's plan and made every effort to achieve a great leap in agricultural production and lay a solid foundation for the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan. At the end of December, the winter production movement, centered on water conservancy construction and manure accumulation, has been launched throughout the province. In most areas, the labor force invested in water conservancy is about 60%, and more than 5.5 million people across the province are working on water conservancy projects every day. According to incomplete statistics, from the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958, it is planned to build 389 large-scale projects with benefits of more than 10,000 mu, of which 238 have already started construction, 108,929 medium-sized projects with benefits of more than 1,000 mu and less than 10,000 mu, of which 105,542 have started construction, more than 29,000 have been completed, and there are even more small-scale projects with benefits of about 100 mu, and more than 20,000 have been completed. The characteristics of this movement are that the masses are fully mobilized, the quality of work is better, and although the scale is large, it is not a big rush, and the phenomenon of forced orders has been greatly reduced. However, there are still individual counties and a few areas where the movement is developing poorly. At present, we have proposed that in general areas, it should be controlled within the existing plan, and no further expansion of the plan should be continued, and the plan can be appropriately compressed if the strength is indeed insufficient. At the same time, we emphasize quality inspection and safety protection, and strive to reduce defective products and avoid casualties. According to the current situation, the requirement originally put forward by the Provincial Party Committee to basically eliminate drought in five years is likely to be achieved in about three years.

    依靠群众力量，排除万难，大兴水利
    中共湖北省委员会
    湖北襄阳专区光化、均县在兴修水利上先一步创造了一些重要经验，并在改旱地为水田方面取得了显著的成绩。1957年9月以后，该专区在这两个县的带动之下，已经掀起了一个规模宏大的兴修水利的高潮。为了研究他们的经验，推动全省兴修水利运动的开展，9月下旬省委书记王延春同志曾率领了部分县委书记到光化、均县参观了一次。省委听取汇报以后，认为他们的经验很重要，应当进一步推广。于11月9日，以王任重同志为首，率领五个地委第一书记、三十五个县委书记和省直一部分负责同志，组成襄阳专区水利参观团，到当地去参观。因为11月下旬，全省要开党代表大会，时间较为紧促，主要只看了光化、均县两地，其他县份如襄阳、枣阳、随县、谷城等地只捎带看了一下。参观以后，各地同志普遍反映启发很大，解放了思想，打开了眼界，找到了窍门，增强了信心，给大家上了很生动的一堂课。他们一面看人家的，一面想自己的，认为自己原来的水利规划太保守了，没有跳出老圈子；在回去之前，即各自考虑修订原来的规划。孝感地委并紧接着叫地委负责同志带领部分区乡主要干部也去参观一次。
    兹将这次参观所了解的情况，简报如下：
      几年摸索走了一些弯路
    襄阳专区大部分地区，过去是全省的低产区，1954年以前，全区粮食平均每亩产量只二百斤左右，棉花每亩产量只十多斤。产量低的原因，是山多岗多，雨量较少，水利条件很差，特别是水田太少。全区耕地一千五百多万亩，人口五百一十多万，水田仅有三百多万亩，而且一遇干旱，就有几十万亩不能栽秧。像光化县全县七十四万亩耕地，解放前仅有水田六千亩；均县七十一万亩耕地，合作化前仅有水田九万五千多亩，其他县份水田一般也较少，旱地产量，历来都很低，多的两百来斤，少的几十斤，群众生活很苦，红薯是主要食品。他们描写自己生活的流行话是：“早上梆梆梆（切红薯），中午靠山椿（蒸红薯），晚饭换个顿，还是红薯汤。”合作化以来，曾经采取各项措施，力求改变低产的面貌。经过三年来的摸索，干部和群众一致认为基本办法是大力兴修水利，改旱地为水田和水浇地。特别是水田很少的地区，如均县、光化等县，这个要求更为迫切。最初，他们的注意力比较集中在兴修大中型水库方面。从1952年遭到大旱以来，曾经兴修了一些大、中、小型水库，取得了一定的成绩。但是，终因水库工程太大，投资较多，不能普遍兴办，不易形成群众性的运动。同时，当地雨量又较少，也影响到水库的蓄水量，不易达到计划灌溉面积，甚至有些地方修了些干水库。正像均县县委书记陈玉文所说的：“以前总想搞大、中型水库，集中全县几个水利技术人员到处进行勘察，搞了很多报告书，不是因为设计不周，就是因为投资较大，受财力限制，上面批准不了。县里集中自己力量抓一个，把大部分力量都使上，又是县长，又是区长，调动几个区的劳力，拖泥带水，花了不少钱，改的田不多，不能受益的群众很不满意，在群众中流行着‘政府修塘、群众帮忙’的议论。较大的不能多搞，小的又没有搞成。”如何进一步开展兴修水利运动呢？几年来大家都在摸索。
    均县县委支持李大贵的创举
    在这期间，均县明星一社主任李大贵同志打破重重难关，创造了引河水到山坡的经验。他们在互助组和刚要办初级社的时候，曾经陆续把十五亩河滩地改成了水田，亩产七百零一斤，初步实现了吃大米的愿望，激发了群众改田的要求。但是终因力量单薄，不能多办。到1954年初级社成立，扩大到三十八户。那时候，如何改变低产面貌，仍是一个难题。当地有过一首歌谣：“造孽莫过李家湾，湾后荒山，湾前河滩，不干就淹，吃不饱来穿不暖。”为了改变这个处境，李大贵同志反复地钻研，认为只有把旱地改为水田才是出路。在过去的经验的基础上，大胆地提出了把河水引到山坡，把山坡旱地改为水田的计划。县委第一书记陈玉文同志支持他。社里除少数人赞成外，多数的社员都害怕困难，提出种种顾虑。有的人讽刺地唱：“说道歌，唱道歌，那有河里石头滚上坡。”五十九岁的杨季成说：“想把河水引上山坡，这不是旱地里拉船，胡整吗！”还有人说：“李大贵要是能把河水引上李家湾，我就把姓改掉。”他的父亲和爱人也想不通，说：“祖辈以来，就没人敢做这件事，你简直净瞎想！”李大贵不顾一切反对和非难，日夜琢磨把河水引到山坡的窍门。他根据当民兵的时候打枪瞄准的道理，用一根二尺来长打通节的竹筒，放在盛满水的碗上，伏在地上向对面望去，发现了对面河水流过的地方比李家湾的地势高，肯定了可以开渠，引水。他同时耐心引导群众算修渠用工账和改田增产账，打破了群众怕白误工的顾虑。这时，已有较多的人站在他一边了。但是，还有些人想不通。他就采取因人制宜的办法，把积极支持开渠的人组成专门的班子，其他思想暂时不通的，分配做社里别的活路。经过九天的努力，终于开成了一条三百八十五公尺长的渠，第一次把河水引到李家湾的山坡。水从屋边流过，群众高兴地说：“今后家里水缸没有用了，可以改成菜缸。”七十五岁的双目失明的李正道老汉扶着拐棍去摸摸渠水，感动地说：“过去地主有钱又有势，可是渠就修不通。现在办了社，共产党就叫河水来到了我们李家湾。”当年就改了三十亩水田，亩产六百九十斤。这一炮打响以后，他们1955年和1956年又继续修了三条长渠和两口大塘。社扩大到一百三十八户。过去只有六十二亩水田，这时候增加到六百多亩，平均一户有四亩多水田了。群众兴奋地说：“从前张李二湾光秃秃，现在住在田中央；祖祖辈辈荒坡地，变成稻谷黄亮亮。”过去想不通的，现在也想通了；原来要退社的，现在也不退了。他们兴修水利的劲头更大了，计划在这个冬季和春季再修堰渠四道、塘两口、小水库三个。完成这些工程以后，可以使该社一千五百四十亩旱地改为水田。春耕前能完成七百亩，比原有水田多一倍以上。争取到1962年达到二千三百亩，由过去每人七厘水田增加到二亩八分。到1964年计划达到三千亩水田。那时候，全社除二百二十亩不能改的旱地以外，就都是水田了，每人平均有三亩六分。如水田以每亩粮食单产七百斤计算，该社可由现在五十九万斤产量增加到二百一十万斤，增产二倍以上，每人平均粮食二千五百多斤。
    李大贵的引河水上山的创举，得到县委的积极支持，大力推广他的经验。在1955年和1956年两年内均县用类似的方法改了水田三万五千多亩。
    光化县发展了均县的经验
    与此同时，邻县光化吸收他们的经验，并发展了他们的经验。光化原来水田比均县还少，河流也小，劳动力不多，群众生活很苦。1956年合作化以后，他们就一直寻找改水田的门道，在平原、低洼地、山岗地和丘陵地分别地进行了改水田的试验，共改了六千亩，都成功了，亩产达到六百斤以上，打破了干部和群众不能改田的种种顾虑。但是，水量是否够用呢？仍然是一个没有解决的问题。该县赵岗乡六合社在1956年冬计划堵九条山冲修九个小水库，改田五百亩，修了一冬，费工二万多，修起了五个小水库。但因一冬无雨，到1957年要下秧的时候，水库还是干的。群众纷纷议论：“不要说五百亩，看样子五亩也不能改了。”怎么办呢？社员们在附近的永固社引河水灌渠的启示下，提议在杜槽河闸壋，开一条十三里的长渠，从远处把河水引上山坡，渠道盘山而过。结果，只费了四千多个工，就把渠修成了。已经快到割麦的时候，还改了四百二十亩水田（其中二百多亩是荒坡）。渠道经过原来修的一个干水库附近的时候，引水入库，把干水库灌得满满的，进一步启发了他们的“渠库相连，常年蓄水，忙时灌田”的思想。采用这个办法，经过全面计算，全县只要把每一滴水都利用起来，水量还是够用的。原来以为在河的上游筑坝后，下游的水量就要大大减少，大家都顾虑：上面修了拦河坝，下面是否能再修呢？实际情况打破了这个顾虑。上面堵了以后，走不多远，河里水又是哗哗地流，下面同样可以再修。一条杜槽河筑了二十五座拦河坝，开了二十五条长渠，直到最末一道拦河坝的水还是不见少。根据实践的经验，他们找到了解决问题的关键，提出了“全面勘察，统一规划，节节拦水，盘山开渠，远处引水，近处灌田，渠堰相连，常年蓄水，忙时用水”的办法。在“依靠群众勤俭治水”的方针下，想尽一切办法，因地制宜，把河水、泉水、地下水、山沟流水都尽可能利用起来，组成一个全面的自流灌溉系统。他们的口号是：“水利合作化。”群众的说法是：“逢山开山，逢水过水，水到那里，社会主义就到那里。”在县委深入领导下，在1957年抗旱运动中，把水利工作推进了一大步，冬播的时候就已经形成高潮。到10月为止，该县已完成一千四百三十七处工程，改田五万三千多亩。全县由原来每户一分水田变成了一户一亩水田了。由于已经取得了较为完整的经验，到处有了改田增产的榜样，干部和群众都劲头十足。在“吃大米”的口号鼓舞下，每个农业合作社都努力挖掘潜力，想尽各种克服困难的办法来搞水。县委原来计划从1957年冬到1958年春改田七万亩，在规模宏大的群众性的治水运动中，计划一再被突破。到目前为止，规划已提高到改水田二十五万亩，水浇地五万亩，共三十万亩。原来规划到1967年全县改田四十五万亩。现在看来，两三年内就可以提前完成。这样，光化就可以由旱地县变为水田县，由低产县变为高产县了。到1962年把每亩产量由三百斤提高到六百斤，就有把握了。襄阳地委及时推广光化县的经验
    襄阳地委对光化县这个成功的经验非常重视，及时地组织各县同志前去参观，对全区起了极大的推动作用。大家都认为：光化条件比各地较差，光化能办到的，在其他地方同样也应该办到。参观回去后，各县都根据本地情况深入摸底，充分发动群众修订原来的规划。在短时间内，就形成了全专区兴修水利的高潮。不仅小型水利普遍地由群众自己动手来搞，而且许多规模较大的大、中型工程也由群众自办，政府加以领导和扶助。枣阳县修了两条二百里以上的长渠和一个灌溉两万亩的水库，没有用什么钱，只由政府补助六万元，群众自筹三万元。其他县的情况，也都类似。“自筹、自办、自管理”已经成为群众性的口号，连十多岁的小孩也知道讲这一条道理了。均县原来在兴修水利上已创造了许多经验，在光化的启示和推动下，干部和群众的积极性更为高涨，今年的水利规划，几个月来，连作了三次修改，由原来计划改田四万亩提高到七万亩，争取完成九万五千亩。冬播前原打算完成改田二万亩，已经完成二万五千亩。
    12月末，襄阳专区各县，每天投入水利工程的，已达一百五十万劳动力，满山遍野到处都是修渠开山的人群。原来该专区1957年冬到1958年春的规划，经过一再修改后，确定改水田一百五十万亩（其中开荒一百一十四万亩），水浇地八十万亩，共二百三十万亩（实际上，下面的计划比这个数字还要大）。此外，还可增加保收田和改善灌溉面积一百五十万亩。预计全区1958年要在1957年产粮四十亿斤的基础上再增产八亿斤。他们合作化两年以来共只改了七十四万亩水田；这次计划完成后，一个冬春就发展到一百五十万亩，超过两年成绩一倍以上，大大地跃进了一步。正如群众所说：“现在有了合作社，干上一年就办了过去几辈子也办不到的事。”
    襄阳专区兴修水利的经验，概括起来有以下几点：
    运用合作化的条件打破陈规
    1、在合作化的基础上，打破了历来的陈规，充分地利用了河水，把过去的分散的孤立的渠、堰、塘、库，连结为一个完整的全面的自流灌溉系统——西瓜秧式的水利系统。这样做，第一是把河溪里平时流失的大量的无用之水引向山坡，使山坡、岗地、平原等各种各样的地形都得到灌溉之利，大量的旱地都可以改为水田，改变了过去“山岗地望天收”的状况。第二，由于把渠道和塘堰连系起来，用时灌田，闲时灌堰，大大地扩大了蓄水量，打破了以前的一个流量只能灌溉一万亩的老教条。因为那种计算方法，仅仅是从用水时可以供给的流量来计算的，没有考虑到：把平时流失的水量储蓄起来，灌溉面积就可以扩大十几倍以上。解决这个问题，在那些河流很小的地区是一个很重要的关键。如光化县杜槽河长五十里，流量仅0.06秒公方，按过去计算方法，只能灌田六百亩。现在，他们在这条河的上下游筑坝二十五处，开渠二十五道，共长一百零三华里，可灌田九千九百亩，扩大十五倍以上。如果加上拦蓄洪水，灌溉面积还要扩大很多。根据他们这个经验，今后在大、中型水库的渠道两侧，因地制宜，多修一些塘堰，可以使水库发挥更大的作用。第三，由于从高处、远处引水，变抽水、车水为自流灌溉，大大地节省了人力、财力，解决了过去所不能解决的许多问题。过去想要利用河水，总从建立抽水机站、筑大拦河坝方面着想，一动就是几百万元，要钢骨水泥许多吨，很难办到。现在采用这种办法，大量的水利工程都可以由群众自办了。根据他们的经验，拦河筑坝引水，一般地应先支流、后干流，先小河、后大河。因为支流、小河总是地势较高、较易引水，工程也较小，较易，危险性较小，开长渠虽然也费工不少，只要有一定的技术指导，群众都可以自办。开渠要注意的问题，是干渠不能“低头”（即不能“跌水”，坡降应小于三千分之一），一直把水从高处引去，使山坡、岗地都能受到灌溉之利。一“低头”，就降低了它的效率。这样做，灵活性也比较大，渠修到哪里灌到哪里，力量来不及可以暂时停下来，将来再延长。
        依靠群众，勤俭治水
    2、贯彻了依靠群众，勤俭治水的方针。许多地方过去在这个问题上，思想是不够明确的，总想向上面多要几个钱。技术干部也是热衷于搞大型像样的工程。有些群众则存在着“政府修塘，群众帮忙”的思想。许多问题都难于解决。现在他们明确规定了以小型为主的方针。在统一规划下，号召群众自筹、自修、自用、自管理。工程的兴建，交给群众去讨论，由群众自己作主来办，情况就完全变了。以前要花很多钱办的事，现在不花钱或花很少的钱，就能办到了。例如光化县前年由政府投资在仙人渡乡胡家洼修了一座水库，用钱三万五千元，仅灌田三百亩。今年该县幸福社群众自修了一个同样的工程，也灌田三百亩，政府一个钱也没有给，合作社只花了三元多的灯油费。今年该县共修了可灌溉五万多亩的工程，只用国家贷款二万多元。襄阳专区由国家投资较大工程四十二处，通过群众讨论，省下三百一十八万元，又多搞了受益万亩以上的工程十二处。凡是群众能办的事，他们自己就想尽千方百计来节省开支，能省者省，能代者代，不愿多花一个钱，国家贷款也不愿多要。如均县六里坪区火花社在计划横跨山崖修一道长渠的时候，技术干部说要十万多斤水泥，几千斤炸药，把该社三年收的粮食全贴上也不够。社主任朱庆喜同志想出各种方法来节约。开始炸石崖不会放炮，就请了一个炮匠，自己蹲在旁边学。看见放了几炮后，自己学会了，不再请人了。原来凿石头的钻子，用一次要回炉一次，每次花钱一角；他就到铁匠铺里看人家怎样做的，回来搬个风箱在工地自己干开了。既不花钱，又节省时间。当渠道通过山崖，盛水问题不好解决的时候，就找老石匠去请教，用石头砌渠身、黄土填渠心的办法代替了水泥。其他一些小工具，都尽可能用土制的办法来代替。结果，只用二百九十斤炮药，二百斤水泥，三千三百七十个工，五百二十元，一条横过半山崖的二千五百三十公尺的渠道就修起来了，使一百多亩田可以保收，还新改了五十四亩水田。这样主动的例子，是数不尽的。他们的口号是“用穷办法改变穷面貌”。不仅小型工程完全由自己来办，现在是一批一批的中型工程也大部分是由群众自己来办了。他们还要逐步地做到大型水库的渠道工程也不要政府投资，完全由群众自己负担。这样，就真正做到了规模大、花钱少、收效快、受益多的目的。
    在依靠群众自办水利的时候，正确地贯彻自愿互利原则，是一个重要问题。他们一般采取的办法是：民主协议，按受益田亩多少，分摊投资、劳力；多受益的多出，少受益的少出，对不受益的地方给予合理的代价。如果需要国家贷款，规定必须分期偿还。工具尽量做到就地取材，自造自用。小工具一律是社员自带，由社统一修理。动工时，按照工程大小，分社、分队、分段包工，按件计酬。社员们反映：“这样干，心里有个底，镢头下去是硬的，不然就会心软手软。”解决了互利问题和包工问题，便加速了工程的进度，并且保证了质量。
          思想工作贯彻始终
      3、走群众路线，自始至终贯彻思想发动。哪里不通，哪里辩论。每个工程的兴修过程，都是先进思想
  与保守思想激烈斗争的过程。思想不通的人，不是说“一方水土养一方人，生就吃红苕的嘴，莫想吃大米”，就是说“能改田，老辈人早就改了，还等你们，就你们能？”还有人耽心挖断了“龙脉”，走了“地气”，坏了“风水”，或触犯了“煞太岁”，要惹起灾害。碰到困
  难的时候一切怪话就都来了，甚至拿“砍脑袋、挖眼睛”
  来打赌。光化县纪洪岗乡联合社开渠的时候，有些社员
  不相信水能过来，把领导开渠的区干部吴青山比做秦始
  皇；后来渠挖通、水过来了，又赞美他是“白娘娘水
  漫金山寺”。解决思想问题的办法，是参观、算账和辩
  论，更主要的一条是领导干部和党团员积极分子带头
  干，虚心听取群众的意见，集中群众的智慧。特别是碰到困难，有些人思想动摇的时候，领导干部的坚定，起着决定性的作用。均县明星四社在修洞子堰的时候，中途要通过一个悬崖，无法施工，群众大都泄了气，并且说：“要打通这个崖，是想人肉吃。”在这种情况下，社长张仁长同志丝毫不动摇，深夜还不回去，留在崖边想办法。这种精神深深地感动了群众，终于想出用绳子吊人在半崖操作的办法，由共青团员亲自动手，把悬崖打通了。这类英雄事迹、英雄人物，现在各地一批一批地涌现出来，用活的事实给了群众有力的教育，大大地提高了群众改造自然的信心。许多干部改变了过去那种强迫命令的作风。
        干部人人学技术，
        翻山越岭带头干
    4、领导干部动手，人人学习技术。他们采取了统一领导、划片分工、层层掌握重点的领导方法，每个负责同志都亲自带领乡社干部翻山越岭进行勘察，寻找水源，响亮地提出“不放松一股水，不放过一个好地形”的口号。县、区、乡、社层层制定自己的规划，各有重点，随时参观评比，交换经验，互相学习，互相推动。大家都劲头十足，谁都害怕落了后。特别是干部的作风，起了一个根本的改变。从勘察设计到施工，自始至终都和群众一道干，大大地密切了干群关系，鼓舞了群众的情绪，同时也丰富了领导的经验。运动全面开展后，技术力量跟不上是个大问题。一般每县都只有十来个技术员，而且多半是新出来的学生，懂得的东西也不多。唯一的办法是自己动手学。光化县委带头听技术干部讲课，号召全体干部学技术，把听讲和现场实习结合起来，搞农业技术的人也要求初步懂得水利技术，并在社里挑选一批人来训练。光化县在采取一系列办法之后，现在已经培养了七百多个农民技术员，他们已经粗通水利知识，小型工程自己都能够动手了。各级干部对水利技术也都粗通一些门道，许多干部都带小水平仪一个，能够自己动手测量地形，提出设计施工的意见，认真地贯彻了领导干部、技术人员与群众相结合的原则。
  对全省起了极大的推动作用
    参观襄阳专区水利建设，对全省水利运动起了极大的推动作用。各地同志在到现场考察之后，又在省党代表大会上互相交流了经验，根据全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）和省委提出的增产指标，重新拟订了本省的规划，用一切努力争取实现农业生产大跃进，为完成第二个五年计划打下稳固的基础。12月末，以兴修水利和积肥为中心的冬季生产运动，已在全省范围内展开，大部分地区投入水利的劳力约在60％左右，全省每日出工修水利工程的约有五百五十万人以上。据不完全统计，1957年冬到1958年春计划修建受益万亩以上的大型工程为三百八十九处，已经动工的有二百三十八处，受益万亩以下千亩以上的中型工程十万八千九百二十九处，已动工的有十万五千五百四十二处，已完工的二万九千多处，还有为数更多的受益百亩左右的小型工程，目前已完工二万多处。这次运动的特点是群众发动充分，工作质量较好，规模虽大而不是大?大轰，强迫命令的现象大大减少。但还有个别县和少数地区，运动开展得较差。目前我们已提出在一般地区大体上应控制在现有计划之内，不再继续扩大计划，力量确实不足的还可以适当压缩。同时，强调质量检查和安全保护，力求少出废品和避免死伤事故。根据目前情况来看，省委原来提出的在五年内基本消灭旱灾的要求，有可能在三年左右实现。　1957年12月23日（附图片）
