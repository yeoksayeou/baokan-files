Xinhua News Agency, January 19th: The Central Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL) launched a final general attack this afternoon on the heads of the Zhang-Luo Alliance – Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. With this, after seven months of battle, the CDL has achieved a fundamental victory in its counterattack against the bourgeois right-wing elements.

After countless large and small meetings held by the CDL Central Committee and local CDL organizations to expose, refute, and criticize, the reactionary words and deeds of the Zhang-Luo Alliance have been refuted completely, their entire criminal record of opposing the Communist Party, the people, and socialism has been laid bare, and all their conspiracies have been thoroughly crushed. Zhang Bojun has already made a written confession, admitting his crimes of opposing the Communist Party, the people, and socialism. Luo Longji, who had been stubbornly denying everything, has recently begun to show signs of admitting his guilt after repeated criticism.

At the final meeting this afternoon to criticize the Zhang-Luo Alliance, Shi Liang, Vice-Chairman of the CDL, delivered a report entitled "Criticism of the Zhang-Luo Alliance" on behalf of Shen Junru, Chairman of the CDL, and the CDL Central Rectification Leadership Group. This report is a summary of the fundamental victory achieved by the CDL in its seven-month struggle against the Zhang-Luo Alliance. The report comprehensively and thoroughly exposed and criticized the historical background and ideological foundation for the formation of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, the reactionary program of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in opposing the Communist Party, the people, and socialism, as well as the steps and methods used by the Zhang-Luo Alliance in carrying out anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies. The report also emphasized that all CDL members must, on the basis of the fundamental victory already achieved in the anti-rightist struggle, learn from experience and lessons, further enhance vigilance, and, through the rectification movement, carry out the organizational transformation of the CDL and the ideological transformation of its members, so as to turn the CDL into a political force that truly serves socialism.

    The struggle against the Zhang-Luo Alliance is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, a struggle concerning the life and death of the nation and the people

The report pointed out that the struggle between the CDL and the Zhang-Luo Alliance is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, a struggle concerning the life and death of the nation and the people. The report stated that the large amount of facts revealed in the anti-rightist struggle over the past six months proves thousands of times over that the Zhang-Luo anti-Communist, anti-People, anti-Socialist alliance has a reactionary program, as well as being organized, planned, and step-by-step. The reactionary program of the Zhang-Luo Alliance mainly includes: (1) They advocated bourgeois "democracy and freedom," opposed our country's political system and basic policies, opposed the socialist system, opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat, and opposed democratic centralism; (2) They opposed the leadership of the Communist Party over national affairs, primarily opposing the leadership of the Communist Party over intellectuals and scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings, demanding that the Communist Party withdraw from universities and colleges, and withdraw from scientific, cultural, and educational institutions; (3) They opposed the leadership and supervision of the Communist Party over democratic parties, tampered with the political direction of democratic parties, and used democratic party organizations as tools to attack the Communist Party, the people, and socialism; (4) They erased the brilliant achievements of socialist construction, negated the great achievements of the successive revolutionary movements led by the Communist Party, such as the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, ideological remolding, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, inciting anti-Communist sentiment, and attempting to reverse verdicts; (5) They promoted bourgeois democratic individualism and bourgeois science and culture among intellectuals, opposed the study of Marxism-Leninism, and obstructed the ideological remolding of intellectuals and their integration with workers and peasants; (6) They tampered with the political direction of newspapers and periodicals such as Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily, using them as propaganda fronts for anti-Communism and anti-socialism, and advocating bourgeois freedom of the press and publication; (7) They promoted the strength of the imperialist aggressive camp, slandered the socialist camp, and opposed the leaning-to-one-side diplomatic policy; (8) They implemented an organizational line of excluding and attacking leftists, deceiving and hoodwinking centrists, and luring and expanding rightists, arranging henchmen, controlling organizations, seizing real leadership power in the CDL, recruiting troops, and gathering counter-revolutionaries and bad elements to participate in democratic parties, and establishing and expanding a reactionary organizational foundation in democratic parties.

    The Zhang-Luo Alliance is absolutely incompatible with the wishes of the Chinese people on the three most fundamental issues

The report pointed out that the right-wing line of the Zhang-Luo Alliance is absolutely incompatible with the demands and wishes of the Chinese people on the three most fundamental issues: (1) The issue of leadership. Like all reactionaries in Chinese history, the Zhang-Luo Alliance does not accept the leadership of the Communist Party, or accepts it on the surface while opposing it in secret. Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji both advocated that the democratic parties should stand on an equal footing with the Communist Party; both slandered the Communist Party as being laymen in science, culture, and education, and that laymen cannot lead experts, and both opposed the core leadership of the Communist Party in national affairs. This is completely against the interests of the 600 million people, against the interests of the country, and against the constitution and the program commonly accepted by the democratic parties. (2) The issue of the basic system of the country. The Zhang-Luo Alliance repeatedly promoted bourgeois "democracy and freedom," believing that socialism has no democracy. Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji advocated the bourgeois bicameral system, advocated a political design institute, and even advocated the establishment of a special agency to rehabilitate counter-revolutionaries. The Zhang-Luo Alliance opposed the socialist system, opposed the proletarian democratic system, and slandered the dictatorship of the proletariat as a "party-run world" and the root of "three evils." The Zhang-Luo Alliance attempted to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat with the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. (3) The issue of the guiding ideology of our country and people. If the Chinese people want liberation and want to build China into a socialist society, they must take Marxism-Leninism as their guiding ideology. However, when Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji and other right-wing elements attacked the Party by taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification, they opposed the ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism by waving the banner of anti-dogmatism and peddling revisionism. They were determined to oppose the Communist Party, the people, and socialism, so they resolutely opposed the ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism.

    The nature of the actions of the Zhang-Luo Alliance is a counter-revolutionary action, an action of betraying the motherland and the people

The report stated that the nature of the actions taken by the Zhang-Luo reactionary political alliance is a counter-revolutionary action, an action of betraying the motherland and the people. The heads and some of the main figures of the Zhang-Luo Alliance held certain leadership responsibilities in the democratic parties, and had relatively high political positions in state organs and united front organizations. Therefore, they used the legal organizations they participated in leading – the democratic party organizations – and their respective political positions, to carry out illegal anti-Communist, anti-People, and anti-socialist activities. They consistently played a double game, supporting the Communist Party and agreeing to take the socialist road on the surface, while opposing the Communist Party and socialism behind the scenes. Because they had the democratic parties and their respective political positions as shields, they could win over, incite, and deceive a portion of the people to carry out anti-Communist, anti-People, and anti-socialist conspiracies. This is a major characteristic of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's anti-Communist activities.

When discussing the Zhang-Luo Alliance's action plan and steps, the report pointed out that expanding the basic ranks; usurping the leadership of the CDL; launching a frenzied attack on the Communist Party; this is the three-part symphony of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in opposing the Communist Party and socialism. They started from winning over, inciting, and deceiving intellectuals to expand their basic ranks, then usurped the leadership of the CDL, tampered with the political line of the CDL, and finally launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, first seizing the Party's leadership over scientific undertakings and universities, and further seizing the Party's overall leadership in national affairs. These were all carried out according to a pre-determined plan and steps, and mainly by using the legal organization of the CDL.

The report believes that there is also a struggle between two roads on the issue of democratic parties. The correct path for the democratic parties is to accept the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, and take the revolutionary road. Therefore, it is necessary to transform the organization and its members, transforming from bourgeois political parties into political forces that truly serve socialism. Only in this way can a long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with the Communist Party be established. However, the right-wing elements of the Zhang-Luo Alliance refused the leadership of the Communist Party, and they wanted to make the democratic parties into bourgeois opposition parties, competing with the party of the working class for leadership, and taking the counter-revolutionary road.

The report also stated that the struggle between the CDL and the Zhang-Luo Alliance on the issue of intellectuals is also a struggle between two roads. After the great anti-rightist struggle, the two roads for bourgeois intellectuals have been clarified. We must fundamentally transform our political stance through rectification, resolutely abandon the bourgeois stance, and wholeheartedly serve socialism. This is the only bright road that intellectuals must take.

    Through the tempering of this struggle, the political consciousness of the vast number of CDL members has been unprecedentedly improved, and in the local organizations of the CDL, uprightness has risen and evil has declined.

At the conference this afternoon, representatives of local CDL organizations: Zhang Guofan from Tianjin, Chen Wangdao from Shanghai, Peng Dixian from Sichuan, Hu Yisheng from Guangdong, Li Furen from Shaanxi, and Xu Shou Xuan from Jilin spoke one after another. They unanimously agreed with the report on criticizing the Zhang-Luo Alliance made by Shi Liang on behalf of Shen Junru, Chairman of the CDL, and the CDL Central Rectification Leadership Group, believing that this report comprehensively exposed the crimes of the Zhang-Luo Alliance and made profound criticism and correct summarization of the crimes of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. In their speeches, they also exposed many facts about the Zhang-Luo Alliance using local CDL organizations to carry out criminal activities, reported on the decisive victories achieved by local CDL organizations in the massive anti-rightist struggle, and pointed out that through the tempering of this struggle, the political consciousness and political enthusiasm of the vast number of CDL members have been unprecedentedly improved, and a new atmosphere of uprightness rising and evil declining has emerged in the local organizations of the CDL.

The conference today was presided over by Shen Junru, Chairman of the CDL, and Gao Chongmin, Vice-Chairman of the CDL. More than 200 people attended the conference, including other responsible persons of the CDL Central Committee, members and alternate members of the Central Committee in Beijing, and responsible persons of the CDL local organization rectification leadership groups.

    民盟经过七个月战斗举行最后总攻
    反击章罗联盟获得根本胜利
    史良代表沈钧儒全面总结这一声势浩大的斗争
    据新华社19日讯　中国民主同盟中央在今天下午向章罗联盟的首脑——章伯钧和罗隆基进行了最后的总攻击。至此，经过七个月的战斗，民盟对资产阶级右派分子的反击，已经取得了根本胜利。
    经过民盟中央和民盟各地方组织无数次大会小会的揭发、驳斥、批判之后，章罗联盟的反动言行，已经被驳得体无完肤，他们的反共、反人民、反社会主义的全部罪恶事实，已经大白于天下，他们的全部阴谋活动已经被彻底粉碎。章伯钧已经作了书面交代，承认了反共、反人民、反社会主义的罪行。一直狡辩抵赖的罗隆基经过多次批判，最近开始表示低头认罪。
    在今天下午最后一次批判章罗联盟的大会上，民盟副主席史良代表民盟主席沈钧儒和民盟中央整风领导小组，作了题为“章罗联盟批判”的报告。这个报告是民盟七个月来同章罗联盟的斗争取得根本胜利的总结。报告全面地彻底地揭露和批判了形成章罗联盟的历史背景和思想基础，章罗联盟反共、反人民、反社会主义的反动纲领，以及章罗联盟进行反共、反社会主义阴谋活动的步骤和手法。报告中还着重指出全体民盟盟员必须在反右派斗争已取得根本胜利的基础上，吸取经验教训，进一步提高警惕，通过整风运动进行民盟的组织改造和盟员的思想改造，把民盟变成真正为社会主义服务的政治力量。
    同章罗联盟的斗争，是社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，是关系国家民族生死存亡的斗争
    报告指出，民盟同章罗联盟的斗争，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是关系到国家民族生死存亡的斗争。报告中说，半年来反右派斗争所揭发的大量事实，千百次地证明章罗反共、反人民、反社会主义联盟是有反动的纲领的，也是有组织、有计划、有步骤的。章罗联盟的反动纲领主要是：（1）他们宣扬资产阶级的“民主自由”，反对我们国家的政治体制和基本政策，反对社会主义制度，反对无产阶级专政，反对民主集中制；（2）他们反对共产党对国家事务的领导，首先是反对共产党对知识分子和科学文教事业的领导，要共产党退出高等学校，退出科学文教机关；（3）他们反对共产党对民主党派的领导和监督，篡改民主党派的政治方向，利用民主党派组织作为向共产党向人民向社会主义进攻的工具；（4）他们抹杀社会主义建设的辉煌成就。否定共产党所领导的三反、五反、思想改造和肃反等历次革命运动的伟大功绩，煽动反共情绪，企图倒算翻案；（5）他们在知识分子中宣扬资产阶级的民主个人主义思想，和资产阶级的科学文化，反对学习马克思列宁主义，阻挠知识分子思想改造以及和工农相结合；（6）他们篡改光明日报、文汇报等报刊的政治方向，作为反共、反社会主义的宣传阵地，鼓吹资产阶级的新闻自由和出版自由；（7）他们宣扬帝国主义侵略阵营的强大，诽谤社会主义阵营，反对一边倒的外交政策；（8）他们实行排斥打击左派、欺骗蒙蔽中间派、拉拢扩大右派的组织路线，安排爪牙，控制组织，夺取民盟的领导实权，招兵买马，搜罗反革命分子、坏分子参加民主党派，在民主党派中建立和扩大反动的组织基础。
    章罗联盟在最根本的三个问题上和中国人民的愿望绝不相容
    报告指出，章罗联盟的右派路线，在最根本性的三个问题上是和中国人民的要求和愿望绝不相容的：（1）领导权的问题。章罗联盟和中国历史上的一切反动派一样，不接受共产党的领导，或者表面接受，暗中反对。章伯钧、罗隆基都主张民主党派要和共产党分庭抗礼；都诬蔑共产党对科学、文化、教育是外行，外行不能领导内行，都反对共产党在国家事务中的核心领导，这是完全违反六亿人民的利益的，是违反国家的利益的，是违反宪法和民主党派共同接受的纲领的。（2）国家基本制度问题。章罗联盟再三宣扬资产阶级的“民主自由”，认为社会主义没有民主。章伯钧、罗隆基主张资产阶级的两院制，主张政治设计院，甚至主张设立专门机构，为反革命分子平反。章罗联盟反对社会主义制度，反对无产阶级民主制度，诬蔑无产阶级专政是“党天下”，是“三害”的根源。章罗联盟企图用资产阶级专政来代替无产阶级专政。（3）我们国家和人民的指导思想问题。中国人民要解放，要把中国建设成为社会主义社会，就一定要以马克思列宁主义作为指导思想。而章伯钧、罗隆基等右派分子在利用共产党整风的时机向党进攻时，却打着反教条主义的旗帜，贩卖修正主义来反对马克思列宁主义的思想领导。他们决心反共、反人民、反社会主义，所以也就坚决反对马列主义的思想领导。
    章罗联盟行动的性质是一种反革命的行动，是一种背叛祖国和人民的行动
    报告中说，章罗反动政治联盟所采取的行动的性质是一种反革命的行动，是一种背叛祖国和人民的行动，章罗联盟的首脑和一些主要人物都是在民主党派负一定的领导责任的人，在国家机关和统一战线组织中有比较高的政治地位，因此他们就利用他们所参加领导的合法组织——民主党派组织和他们各人的政治地位，来进行反共、反人民、反社会主义的非法活动，他们一贯地玩两面手法，当面拥护共产党，赞成走社会主义道路，背后反对共产党，反对社会主义。由于他们有民主党派和他们各人的政治地位作为护身符，他们就可以笼络、煽惑、蒙蔽一部分人，来进行反共、反人民、反社会主义的阴谋活动。这是章罗联盟进行反共活动的一个主要特点。
    在谈到章罗联盟的行动计划和步骤时，报告指出，扩大基本队伍；篡夺民盟领导；向共产党猖狂进攻；这就是章罗联盟反共、反社会主义的三部曲。他们从笼络、煽惑、蒙蔽知识分子，扩大基本队伍开始，到篡夺民盟的领导，篡改民盟的政治路线，最后向党向社会主义猖狂进攻，首先夺取党对科学事业和高等学校的领导权，进一步夺取党在国家事务中的全部领导权。这都是按照预定的计划和步骤，并且主要是利用了民盟这一合法组织来进行的。
    报告认为，在民主党派的问题上，也存在着两条道路的斗争。民主党派的正确道路是接受工人阶级和共产党的领导，走革命的道路，因此必须经过组织和成员的改造，由资产阶级性的政党，转变成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量，这样才能建立和共产党长期共存、互相监督的基础。但是，章罗联盟右派分子拒绝共产党的领导，他们要使民主党派成为资产阶级反对党，和工人阶级的政党争夺领导权，走反革命的道路。
    报告中还说，在关于知识分子问题上民盟和章罗联盟之间的斗争，也是两条道路的斗争。经过伟大的反右派斗争，资产阶级知识分子的两条道路已经判明，我们一定要通过整风从根本上改造政治立场，坚决抛弃资产阶级立场，全心全意为社会主义服务，这才是知识分子所必须走的唯一光明大道。
    经过这次斗争的锻炼，广大盟员的政治觉悟空前提高，民盟各地组织正气上升邪气下降
    在今天下午的大会上，民盟地方组织的代表：天津的张国藩，上海的陈望道，四川的彭迪先，广东的胡一声，陕西的李敷仁和吉林的徐寿轩先后发了言。他们一致同意史良代表民盟主席沈钧儒和民盟中央整风领导小组所作的批判章罗联盟的报告，认为这个报告全面地揭露了章罗联盟的罪行，并对章伯钧、罗隆基的罪行，作了深刻的批判和正确的总结。他们在发言中还揭发了章罗联盟利用民盟地方组织进行罪恶活动的许多事实，报告了各地民盟组织在声势浩大的反右派斗争中所取得的决定性胜利，指出经过这次斗争的锻炼，广大民盟成员的政治觉悟和政治热情空前提高，民盟各地组织内出现了正气上升、邪气下降的新气象。
    今天的大会由民盟主席沈钧儒和副主席高崇民主持，民盟中央的其他负责人、在京中委、候补中委，民盟地方组织整风领导小组的负责人等共二百多人出席了大会。
