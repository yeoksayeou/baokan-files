    I think the Party group's criticism of Comrade Huang Xiuying is correct. Because purchasing anything should be based on the principle of buying only what is necessary and lacking; if it's something you could buy or not buy, then don't buy it. Comrade Huang Xiuying already had woolen clothes and cotton clothes, yet she bought new ones; a wristwatch is something that is optional, and she bought it too. This does not conform to the principle of thrift.

    Having extra money, and always wanting to buy something nice, is a common psychology. However, at a time when our country needs to use the spirit of hard struggle to build socialism, we should do this: if we can buy it or not buy it, we shouldn't buy it, and save the extra money in the bank. For example, my current cotton shoes, I've been wearing them for two years, the heels are worn thin, and the fluff on the shoe surface has fallen off in some places, so I've long been planning to buy a pair of leather boots. I planned to wear these old cotton shoes to work on weekdays, and wear the leather boots on holidays or when attending social gatherings. I saved the money to buy leather boots as early as September 1957, and even exceeded the amount, but I still haven't bought them today. Because I have some ideological contradictions: if I buy them, I have something to wear now; if I don't buy them, I feel embarrassed to wear these old cotton shoes when I go out to play or attend social gatherings. Yesterday, I listened to the report on the "Revised Draft of the National Agricultural Development Program," and I gave up the idea of buying leather boots. Our country has a large population and little land. To build a happy and beautiful socialist society, we still need the people of the whole country to go through a long period of hard struggle. Therefore, I will deposit the remaining money in the bank, and from this year on, I will buy as many government bonds as possible. As for attending social gatherings or going out to play, why must I wear leather boots? Today, only those who are extravagant and wasteful will feel embarrassed in front of everyone; they will be laughed at. A thrifty and simple person will be respected.

### 我不买皮靴了

    我不买皮靴了
    我认为党小组会对黄秀英同志的批评是正确的。因为购买什么东西都应当本着必须要用而又没有的才买；可买可不买的就不买的原则。黄秀英同志原来有绒衣、棉衣，又买新的；马蹄表是可有可无的，她也买了。这是不符合节俭的原则的。
    有了多余钱，总想买点好东西，是一般人常有的心理。但是，在我们国家正需要用艰苦奋斗精神建设社会主义的时候，我们应该做到：可买可不买的就不买，把余钱存到银行去。比如我现在的棉鞋，穿了二年啦，后跟已磨薄了，鞋面上的绒有的地方都掉了，因此我早就准备买一双皮靴。打算平日上班就穿这双旧棉鞋，在假日或参加联欢会的时候就穿皮靴。买皮靴的钱，我早在1957年9月里就攒好了，并且超额完成了，可是一直到今天也没买。因为思想上有些矛盾：买吧，目前有的穿；不买吧，万一出去玩或参加联欢会的时候，穿这双旧棉鞋真感到不像样子。昨天，我听了“农业发展纲要修正草案”的报告，就打消了买皮靴的念头了。我们的国家人多地少，要建设成幸福美好的社会主义社会，还需要全国人民经过较长时期的艰苦奋斗。因此我要把余下的钱存入银行，并且从今年起，尽量多买一些公债。至于参加联欢会或出去玩，又何必非穿皮靴不可呢？今天只有铺张浪费的人，才会在大家面前不好意思；才会被人笑话。一个艰苦朴素的人，是会受人尊重的。
