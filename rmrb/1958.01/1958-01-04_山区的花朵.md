    Mountain Flowers
  　By our reporter Zhu Bo
    On the beautiful eastern bank of the Han River, nestled between the Qinling and Bashan Mountains, stands a small factory. It attracts farmers from within a hundred li radius and maintains close ties with leather, pharmaceutical, dye, and other industrial enterprises across the country. This is China's only state-owned vegetable tanning extract factory—the Shiquan Vegetable Tanning Extract Factory in Shaanxi.
    Since resuming production in October 1951, this factory has consistently adhered to the principle of building an enterprise through diligence and thrift. Over the years, the factory has not added any new equipment or constructed new buildings or offices (only a few dozen single-story dormitories were built). They have continued production using the original simple buildings and outdated machinery. The factory's employees have also demonstrated a high degree of initiative and continuously improved production methods. For example, Ning Zhenye and Tang Yisheng, workers in the extraction section, suggested using hot water to soak the raw materials for tanning extract, shortening the extraction time by more than one-third. In the evaporation workshop, shutdowns were required every month for evaporator pipe repairs, severely impacting production. Later, after repeated research, the workers in this workshop adopted a method of increasing the temperature and using two groups to rotate production and machine repairs. As a result, not only did machine repairs no longer affect production, but output more than doubled. Thanks to the workers overcoming various difficulties, the factory's output increased year by year, and the cost of products decreased year by year. Total output in 1953 was 120.31 tons, increasing to 437.4 tons in 1957. The cost per ton in 1953 was 1,220.28 yuan, decreasing to 866.86 yuan per ton in 1957.
    It can be seen from this factory that there are many benefits to building small industrial enterprises in mountainous areas. One of the main benefits is the ability to obtain materials locally, saving raw material transportation costs and reducing product costs. The raw materials used by the Shiquan Vegetable Tanning Extract Factory are mainly oak bark and acorn shells, requiring nearly four million jin per year. These raw materials are produced in the mountainous areas near the factory, making purchasing easy and inexpensive. In the past, tens of tons of oak bark and acorn shells were transported annually from this area to the coast for fishermen to dye fishing nets, with transportation costs exceeding the original price by tenfold to dozens of times. If this tanning extract factory had been built in Xi'an, Wuhan, or Shanghai, transporting four million jin of oak bark and acorn shells to these areas for processing would have resulted in product costs several times higher than in the raw material producing area.
    Of course, building small factories in mountainous areas also has difficulties, such as weak technical expertise and overly simple equipment (if a part is missing, it must be sourced from Baoji, Xi'an, and other places), etc. Some technical problems are not easy to solve. For example, the Shiquan Tanning Extract Factory's laboratory once analyzed the leaves of the Cyclobalanopsis glauca tree. The analysis results proved that the leaves contained 13% tannin, which is more than oak bark (oak bark contains 12%), but the impurities were too high, and they could not extract it. Therefore, they urgently hope for technical support from various regions.
    With the development of national economic construction, the production of the Shiquan Vegetable Tanning Extract Factory cannot meet the needs of the country. Therefore, the state has built a new vegetable tanning extract factory near the old one. The new factory is larger than the old one, and most of the new factory's equipment are new products from domestic machinery factories. The new factory's crushing, extraction, drying, and other processes are almost entirely mechanized, and the production cycle can be shortened by half compared to the old factory. After the new factory goes into production, the annual output will be more than 800 tons, which, combined with the old factory, will result in a total annual output of more than 1,300 tons.
    Even so, it still cannot meet the country's needs for vegetable tanning extracts. Last year, the Shiquan Vegetable Tanning Extract Factory had already begun training technical workers for Guangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hubei, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and the Northeast. During the second five-year plan, mountain flowers like the Shiquan Vegetable Tanning Extract Factory will bloom in greater numbers.

    山区的花朵
  　本报记者　朱波
    在秀丽的汉江东岸，在秦岭巴山之间，有一座小型工厂。它吸引着周围百里内的农民，同各地制革、制药、染料等工业企业有着密切的联系。这就是我国目前唯一的国营植物鞣料厂——陕西石泉植物鞣料厂。
    这座工厂从1951年10月恢复生产以来，一直坚持执行了勤俭办企业的方针。几年来，这个厂没有增添什么新的设备，没有新建厂房和办公室（只建了几十间平房宿舍）。他们就利用原有的简陋的建筑和陈旧的机器设备，坚持进行生产。全厂职工还发挥了高度的积极性，不断地改进了生产方法。例如浸提工段工人宁振业和唐义胜建议用热水浸泡原料，提炼鞣料，使浸提的时间缩短了三分之一以上。蒸发车间的蒸发管，过去每月检修的时候都要停工，严重地影响产量；后来，这个车间的工人经过反复研究，采用加高温度的办法，两组轮流生产，轮流检修机器，结果不仅不再因为检修机器而影响产量，还把产量提高了一倍以上。由于工人们战胜了种种困难，这个厂的产量一年比一年增加，产品的成本也一年比一年降低。1953年总产量是一百二十点三一吨，1957年增加到四百三十七点四吨。1953年每吨成本是一千二百二十点二八元，1957年降低到每吨八百六十六点八六元。
    从这个工厂可以看出，在山区建设小型工业企业有许多好处。主要好处之一就是可以就地取材，节省原料运输费用，降低产品成本。石泉植物鞣料厂使用的原料主要是槲树皮和橡壳，每年需要近四百万斤。这些原料就出在工厂附近的山区，因此收购容易，价钱便宜。过去这里每年运往沿海几十吨槲树皮、橡壳，供渔民染渔网使用，仅运费就超过原价十几倍到几十倍；如果把这座鞣料厂建设在西安、武汉或上海，把四百万斤槲树皮和橡壳运往这些地区去加工，产品成本也会比在原料产地高出几倍。
    当然，在山区建设小型工厂也有困难，例如技术力量薄弱，设备过于简陋（缺少一个零件，就要到宝鸡、西安等地去配），等等。有些技术问题，不容易解决。例如石泉鞣料厂化验室曾经对青刚树叶子进行过化验。化验的结果证明，青刚树叶子含鞣料13％，比槲树含的还多（槲树皮含12％），但是杂汁太多，他们没有办法提出来。因此，他们迫切希望各地在技术力量上加以支援。
    随着国家经济建设的发展，石泉植物鞣料厂的生产不能满足国家的需要了。因此，国家又在这个厂的附近新建一座植物鞣料厂。新厂比老厂规模大，新厂的大部分设备都是国内机械厂的新产品。这个厂的切碎、浸提、干燥等工序，几乎全部是机械化的，生产周期可以比老厂缩短一半。新厂投入生产以后，年产量将有八百多吨，加上老厂，年产量共有一千三百多吨。
    尽管这样，也还不能满足国家对植物鞣料的需要。去年，石泉植物鞣料厂已经开始为广西、浙江、福建、湖北、四川、新疆和东北等地培训技术工人。在第二个五年计划期间，像石泉植物鞣料厂这样的山区花朵将会开得越来越多。
