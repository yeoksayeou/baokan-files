    New York Diary Excerpts
    by Soviet Writer Fyodor Kozhevnikov
    My friend, Sofronov, editor-in-chief of "Ogonyok" magazine, suggested that I go to the United States as a special correspondent to attend the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly, and I accepted this proposal with great joy.
    I really wanted to see how ordinary Americans lived, to understand their thoughts and desires, and had no other extravagant hopes. The guiding principle of my notes is to record what I see with my own eyes.
    Let me be frank: in my imagination, America is a capitalist behemoth, a behemoth that prides itself on its wealth. But no matter how great this wealth is, I decided to open my eyes and take a look, and faithfully relay everything I saw.
    From the plane, I saw the crystallization of reinforced concrete that I had already recognized from pictures, the dazzling skyscrapers, the tallest of which is the "Empire State Building," which Americans call the "Eighth Wonder of the World."
    That's how I arrived in New York.
    The manager of the "Didot" Hotel poured cold water on what I had heard about the cheap cost of living in America. He handed me the room key and said: It costs twelve dollars a night; if you want to watch TV, it's an extra two dollars; you pay every time you make a phone call. The room was small, with very few pieces of old and dilapidated furniture. In our country, you only find such rooms in hotels in district centers.
    I couldn't wait to go out into the street immediately to see this big city. First, I admired the magnificent skyscrapers, which stand like lonely cliffs above the most ordinary European architecture. People don't live in skyscrapers; they are just countless offices. When night falls, the skyscrapers stand there like dark towers, their windows pitch black. I turned onto Forty-Second Street and walked west. The further away from the city center, the quicker the traditional style of New York disappears. The roadside is lined with three- or four-story buildings made of dark brown brick, with rusty iron staircases exposed outside. The streetlights are sparse and dim. A gust of wind blew, and a foul smell wafted from the asphalt road, and the garbage blocked by broken boards next to the sidewalk was all dried up. Strong smells of alcohol emanated from the dark and narrow bars with low ceilings. There, some people sat on high stools covered with iron in front of the counter, silently drinking without eating anything. At the entrance of the bar, a group of young men and women huddled together, wearing short coats, their heads shined brightly. Some of the girls wore trousers with narrow legs that just covered their knees, and their eyes were painted with deep black circles. Next to the houses, some elderly women sat in chairs, breastfeeding their children while staring at the freshly washed clothes drying on the ropes. The veins on these women's hands were bulging, and their faces were full of sorrow and sadness. They were nothing like the wives in the promotional posters displayed in department store windows, who made charming smiles at American washing machines. It can be seen that these American women do not doubt that their rulers will dominate the world; nor do they doubt that washing machines are the "best friend of every woman" in America.
    The further west I walked, the darker the streets became, and the shorter buildings and the shapes of the houses became more and more unclear. So, I decided to go back. The lights in the bars had already gone out, and some drunk people walked along the sidewalk with depressed footsteps. It gave the impression that thousands of people who had just recovered from a serious illness had just walked out of a large hospital. They walked against the walls of the houses, swaying, their shoulders rubbing against the walls. A man wearing a tattered felt hat walked towards me with heavy steps. He glanced at me, and then asked me with a questioning tone:
    "Are you rich? I used to have money too, don't think you're anything special." He came closer to me and made a request: "Give me a dollar!"
    I hurried away, afraid of being pestered by this drunkard.
    He continued to shout at me: "Hey! Did you come here to find a girl? I can point you to a place, definitely not expensive!"
    I walked along this alcohol-scented street, and the rusty stairs of the faded buildings along the road kept making low, clattering sounds. I tripped over a pit on the sidewalk, and hurriedly climbed out of the pit, and saw the top of the "Eighth Wonder of the World," the Empire State Building, shimmering there like a lonely red cloud.
    After I returned to the hotel, I told Oleg Orekhov, the "Pravda" correspondent stationed in New York, about my first tour of New York. He said to me meaningfully:
      "You are very lucky. They might have beaten you up and then robbed you. After sunset, no one dressed very well walks on the street in this area. They don't like this kind of people."
    He seemed to be boasting to me about his understanding of New York, saying:
      "In the past six months, there have been more criminal incidents in this happy city than in the past year. You are lucky that you have not personally recognized this development of American progress."
    But, I quickly recognized all of this.
    A middle-aged American, Dr. John W., volunteered to be my guide. He had a son who was killed in the war against German fascists. After this doctor learned about my monthly living expenses, he said to me: "Ah, you have enough for the living standard of a middle-income American." So he took me around based on this standard. We had lunch and breakfast in the Horn & Hardart Automat. Here, everyone is self-service: filling their plates according to their financial strength and taste. People don't take off their coats and hats when eating, and they don't talk, their expressions are anxious and flustered.
    The first time I went, I asked Dr. John W. to choose the dishes for me... In my lunch plate there was a small cup of tomato juice, a plate of corn porridge, three small pieces of cellophane-wrapped hard bread, a small piece of butter smaller than a five-cent coin, a little brown sauce; and as a dessert, a small slice of unripe pear. The doctor's plate was the same.
    I politely said to him that it would be better to have some meat. The doctor replied in a persuasive tone: "The first type of meat is too expensive, and the second type of meat has been stored in the refrigerator for too long, and all the vitamins have been destroyed."
    "Then a little milk would be good!"
    The doctor nodded towards the automatic milk dispenser and said in a doctor's tone, "You won't get fresh milk from cows here, only powdered milk mixed with water. It is mixed with anti-acid chemicals, which are harmful to the body."
    "Well, then let's have a big glass of tomato juice to eat."
    "That's too wasteful," the doctor said seriously: "If you're thirsty, drink some cold water, which may be free."

    纽约日记片断
    苏联作家　弗·科热夫尼科夫
    我的朋友、“星火杂志”主编索弗洛诺夫建议我以特派记者身份到美国去参加联合国第十二届大会，当时我非常欣快地接受了这个提议。
    我非常想看看普通美国人怎样生活，想了解他们的思想和愿望，此外没有任何别的奢望。我的札记所遵循的方针，就是记下我亲眼看到的东西。
    不妨直言相告：在我的想像中美国是一个资本主义的庞然大物，是一个把自己的富裕引为骄傲的庞然大物。但是，不管这种富裕到了什么程度，我决定要睁开眼睛来看一看，并且忠实地转述我所看到的一切。
    从飞机上我就看到了根据图片早已认识了的那些钢筋水泥的结晶群，光彩夺目的摩天楼，其中最高的是被美国人称之为“世界第八奇景”的“帝国大厦”。
    我就是这样来到了纽约。
    “狄多尔”饭店的管事对我所听说的美国生活便宜的这种说法浇了一盆冷水。他把房间的钥匙交给我时对我说：住一昼夜是十二块美金；如果想看电视，外加两块；每打一次电话付一回钱。这个房间很小，摆着很少几件陈旧破乱的家具。如果在我国，只有在区中心的旅馆里才有这种房间。
    我迫不及待地立即走到街上去，想观看一下这个大城市。首先瞻仰了辉煌的摩天楼，它们像高耸在最普通的欧洲建筑原野之上的一些孤零零的峭壁。人们不住在摩天楼里，那里是无数的办公室，夜一来临，摩天楼像一些阴暗的塔站立在那里，它们的窗户一片漆黑。我转过第四十二街向西部走去。离市中心越远，纽约的传统的风格便尽快地消失了。路旁都是用暗褐色的砖砌起来的三、四层的楼，生了锈的铁楼梯露在外面。路灯稀疏而昏暗。一阵疾风吹来，柏油马路上飘来一股难闻的气味，人行道旁用破板子挡起来的垃圾都干涸了。从天花板很低的黑暗而狭小的酒吧间里传出强烈的酒味。在那里，有些人坐在柜台前包着铁皮的高凳子上，他们默默地什么也不吃，干喝着酒。在酒吧间的入口处，簇拥着一群青年男女，穿着短外衣，头上擦得亮光光的，其中有些女孩子，穿着刚过膝盖的小裤脚管裤子，他们的眼睛涂着深深的黑眼圈。在房子旁边，一些上了年纪的妇女坐在椅子上，她们一边给孩子喂奶，同时眼睛钉住绳子上晒着的刚刚洗好的衣服。这些女人的双手青筋暴突，她们的脸上充满了忧愁和悲伤。她们完全不像百货商店橱窗上张贴的宣传画上画的那些对着美国洗衣机做出媚人的微笑的太太们。可以看出，这些美国女人完全不怀疑：她们的统治者将独占全世界；她们也不会怀疑，洗衣机在美国是“每个妇女的良友”。
    我往西部走得愈远，街上也愈来愈黑了，矮一些的楼房和房屋的形状愈来愈看不清楚了。于是，我决定往回走。酒吧间的灯光已经熄了，一些带着醉意的人沿着人行道抑郁地曳着脚步走去。给人这样一个感觉：好像是几千个大病方愈的人刚从某个大医院里走出来似的。他们靠着房屋的墙壁走去，摇摇晃晃地，肩膀擦着墙壁。一个戴着一顶破毡帽的人曳着沉重的脚步向我走来，他看了我一眼，然后带着疑问的口气问我：
    “你很有钱吗？我也有过钱，别以为你有什么了不起。”他走近我，并且提出要求：“给我一块钱！”
    我赶快走开了，怕被这个醉鬼缠住。
    他接着向我喊：“喂！你是上这儿来找姑娘来的吗？我可以指给你个地方，绝对不贵！”
    我沿着这条酒气熏人的街道走去，路旁褪了色的楼房的生了锈的楼梯不断发出低沉的嘎哒嘎哒的响声。人行道上的坑把我绊了一跤，急急忙忙爬出这个坑，便看到“世界第八奇景”帝国大厦的楼顶像一片红云孤单单地在那里闪烁着光芒。
    我回到旅馆以后，就把我在纽约第一次游览的情况告诉了“真理报”常驻纽约记者奥列霍夫。他意味深长地对我说：
      “你还算很幸运。他们很可能打你一顿，然后就抢你。太阳落山以后，在这一带没有穿著很讲究的人在街上走。那里不喜欢这类人。”
    他好像是向我夸耀他对纽约的了解似地对我说：
      “在最近半年中在这个幸福的城市里犯罪事件要比过去一年还多。你算是侥幸，没有亲自认识美国进步的这种发展。”
    但是，我很快地就认识了这一切。
    一位中年的美国人、医生约翰·乌自愿作我的向导。他有一个儿子曾阵亡于对德国法西斯的战争中。这位医生在知道我每月的生活费用以后向我说：“啊，你足够一个中等收入的美国人的生活水平了。”于是他就依据这个水平来带引我各处走。我们在赫恩·哈达特食堂吃中餐和早餐。这里每个人都是自我服务：按照自己的经济力量和口味盛满自己的盘子。吃饭时人们不脱大衣和帽子，也不说话，神色都焦急而慌张。
    我第一次去是请医生约翰·乌为我选菜……。在我的午餐盘里有一小杯番茄汁、一盘玉蜀黍粥、三小块玻璃纸包的硬面包、一小块比五角美元的硬币还小的黄油、一点棕黄色酱油；作为尾食品的是一小片没有熟透的梨。在医生的碟子里也是一样。
    我客气地向他说，最好能来点肉。医生以规劝的口吻回答道：“第一类荤菜太贵，而第二类荤菜因为在冰箱中放得太久，所有维他命都破坏了。”
    “那么来点牛奶也好！”
    医生向着牛奶自动供应器点头示意地用医生的口吻说道，“这里不会给你奶牛的鲜奶，只有水冲的奶粉。其中掺有防酸的化学品，对身体有坏处。”
    “好吧，那么让我们要一大杯番茄汁来吃好了。”
    “这太浪费了”，医生认真地说：“如果你渴的话，喝点冷开水吧，这可能不要钱。”
                      （未完待续）
