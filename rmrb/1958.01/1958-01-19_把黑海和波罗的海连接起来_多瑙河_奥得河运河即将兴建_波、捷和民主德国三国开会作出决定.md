Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 17th: Experts from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic met in Berlin and Warsaw from January 8th to 16th to discuss the construction of the Danube-Oder Canal, and signed a protocol on the results of the Warsaw meeting on the 17th. After discussion, the three countries unanimously agreed that Poland would provide relevant documents and materials to the Brno Shipping Design Bureau of Czechoslovakia for the design of the canal.

The idea of building the Danube-Oder Canal was put forward at the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance meeting held in Moscow last summer. Now, the Brno Shipping Design Bureau of Czechoslovakia has formulated a detailed economic and technical plan for the construction of the canal. After the completion of the canal project, shipping between the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea can be directly connected, without having to bypass the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. At that time, the annual volume of goods transported through this canal for East Germany alone will be 4.5 million tons.

The Danube-Oder Canal project has attracted the attention of countries in the Danube River basin. In addition to the meetings already held in Berlin and Warsaw, a meeting of the Danube Commission will also be held in Budapest soon to discuss issues related to the canal. Representatives from Yugoslavia and Austria will participate in this meeting.

(Note: According to the introduction in the Soviet "Around the World" magazine, the planned Danube-Oder Canal starts from Koźle in Poland and reaches Bratislava in Czechoslovakia, with a total length of approximately 300 kilometers. Koźle is a city close to the upper reaches of the Oder River, and Bratislava is next to the Danube River. The construction of this canal is part of the grand plan of close cooperation and joint efforts of Eastern European socialist countries to transform the Danube River.) (Attached picture)

    把黑海和波罗的海连接起来
    多瑙河—奥得河运河即将兴建
    波、捷和民主德国三国开会作出决定
    新华社华沙17日电　波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国的专家们于今年1月8日到16日先后在柏林和华沙开会，讨论了关于兴建多瑙河—奥得河运河的问题，并且于17日就华沙会议的结果签定了一项议定书。经过讨论，三国一致同意由波兰方面为设计这个运河的捷克斯洛伐克布尔诺航运设计局提供有关文件和资料。
    开凿多瑙河—奥得河运河的创议是去年夏天在莫斯科召开的各国经济互助委员会会议上提出来的。现在，捷克斯洛伐克的布尔诺航运设计局已经制定了开凿这条运河的详尽的经济和技术计划。在运河工程完工以后，黑海和波罗的海之间的航运就可以直接联系，无须再绕道地中海和大西洋。那时候，每年单是通过这条运河为民主德国运输的物资就将有四百五十万吨。
    多瑙河—奥得河运河工程受到多瑙河流域各国的注意。除了已经在柏林和华沙举行会议以外，最近还将在布达佩斯召开多瑙河委员会会议，以便讨论有关运河的问题。南斯拉夫和奥地利的代表将参加这一会议。
    （按：根据苏联“环球”杂志的介绍，计划中的多瑙河—奥得河运河，从波兰的科兹勒城开始，到达捷克斯洛伐克的布拉迪斯拉发城，全长约三百公里。科兹勒是紧靠奥得河上游的城市，而布拉迪斯拉发旁边就是多瑙河。建造这条运河是东欧社会主义国家亲密合作、共同努力改造多瑙河宏伟计划中的一部分。）（附图片）
