Tractor Stations Established Nationwide in the Five-Year Plan

Beginning in 1953, China started focusing on pilot agricultural machine tractor stations. By 1957, there were 383 tractor stations nationwide, possessing 12,036 standard tractors (each standard tractor calculated at 15 horsepower), serving a cultivated area of 26,190,000 mu. Compared to 1953, the number of stations increased by 33.8 times, the number of tractors increased by 105.4 times, and the cultivated area served increased by 286.8 times, representing considerable and rapid development. At the same time, it exceeded the original First Five-Year Plan development targets of 194 tractor stations, 2,897 standard tractors, and a service area of 3,540,000 mu by 0.97 times, 3.15 times, and 6.4 times respectively.

Currently, all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the country, except for Tibet, have tractor stations; however, they are mainly distributed in dry farming areas on plains. For example, nearly half of the counties in Hebei Province have established tractor stations, totaling 74. (Picture attached)

    五年中全国建立的拖拉机站
    我国从1953年开始重点试办农业机器拖拉机站，到1957年，全国已有三百八十三个拖拉机站，拥有拖拉机一万二千零三十六标准台（每标准台按十五马力计算），服务的耕地面积达到二千六百一十九万亩。以1957年的情况和1953年比，站数增长了三十三点八倍，拖拉机增长了一百零五点四倍，服务的耕地面积增长了二百八十六点八倍，发展相当迅速。同时比第一个五年计划原定的拖拉机站发展指标一百九十四个站、拖拉机二千八百九十七标准台、服务面积三百五十四万亩，也分别超过零点九七倍、三点一五倍和六点四倍。
    目前，全国除西藏外，其他各省、市、自治区都有了拖拉机站；但是主要分布在平原旱作地区。如河北省有近半数的县份已建立了拖拉机站，共达七十四处。（附图片）
    第一个五年计划期间，我国农业拖拉机站有那些发展？
