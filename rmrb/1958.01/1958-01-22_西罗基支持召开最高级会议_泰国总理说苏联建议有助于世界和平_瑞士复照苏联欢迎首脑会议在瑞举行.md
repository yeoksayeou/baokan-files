    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 20th: Czechoslovak Premier Viliam Široký, on the eve of the end of his visit to Cambodia, held a press conference on the evening of the 19th. When talking about the world situation, he said that the current tense situation requires immediate negotiations, and in order to reach an agreement, it is necessary to hold a summit conference. He said that lower-level meetings would only repeat things that have already been said.
    Široký also expressed support for establishing a nuclear-free zone in Europe. He said that since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization decided to supply West Germany with atomic weapons, the issue of establishing a nuclear-free zone has become very important, especially concerning countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Switzerland. Moreover, it is of great significance for resolving the German problem.
    He believes that before a comprehensive disarmament agreement is reached, it is necessary for the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact to sign a mutual non-aggression pact.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: Bangkok News: Thai Prime Minister Nai Thanom Kittikachorn told the press on the 17th regarding the Soviet proposal to hold an East-West summit conference that if the Soviet proposal is made in good faith, it will help world peace, and the Thai government also agrees with this proposal because Thailand also advocates that all countries in the world should coexist peacefully to avoid war.
    Nai Thanom reiterated that Thailand is unwilling to request the United States to increase weapons "aid," nor does it want to ask the United States to supply rocket weapons.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: Bern News: The Swiss government said in a reply to the Soviet government on the 20th that if the most relevant countries agree to hold a conference to ease international tensions, the Swiss government welcomes the conference to be held in Switzerland and is willing to provide assistance to it.
    The reply stated that Switzerland "also believes that the current situation contains serious dangers, and no country should be indifferent to the danger of a new war, let alone let go of any situation that helps to eliminate this danger and promote understanding between countries."
    The reply stated that Switzerland is willing to provide convenience for relevant countries to make contact based on its traditional policy of neutrality, but it is not appropriate for it to "take the initiative" on the issue of convening a conference at this time.

    西罗基支持召开最高级会议
    泰国总理说苏联建议有助于世界和平
    瑞士复照苏联欢迎首脑会议在瑞举行
    据新华社金边20日电　捷克斯洛伐克总理西罗基在结束对柬埔寨的访问的前夕，曾经在19日晚上举行了记者招待会。他在谈到世界局势的问题的时候说，目前的紧张局势，需要立即举行一次谈判，而为了达成协议，召开最高级会议是必要的。他说，较低级的会议只会重复一些已经说过的话。
    西罗基还表示赞成在欧洲建立一个无原子地区。他说，由于北大西洋公约组织决定向西德供应原子武器，建立无原子地区的问题已经变得非常重要，这个问题尤其关系到波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、奥地利和瑞士等国。而且，它对解决德国问题也有极重大的意义。
    他认为，在尚未达成一个全面裁军协定之前，北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约的成员国有必要签订一个互不侵犯协定。
    据新华社21日讯　曼谷消息：泰国总理乃他侬17日就苏联提出的关于举行东西方最高级会议的建议向报界发表谈话说，如果苏联的建议是出于诚意的话，那么它对世界和平将会有所帮助，泰国政府也赞同这个建议，因为泰国也主张世界各国应该和平共处以避免战争。
    乃他侬再次表示泰国不愿意要求美国增加武器的“援助”，也不想要求美国供给火箭武器。
    新华社21日讯　伯尔尼消息：瑞士政府20日在给苏联政府的复信中说，如果最有关的国家同意举行一次缓和国际紧张局势会议的话，瑞士政府欢迎这个会议在瑞士举行，并且愿意对它提供帮助。
    复信说，瑞士“也认为，目前的形势包藏着严重的危险，任何一个国家对于一场新战争的危险都不应该漠然处之，更不应该放过任何一个有助于消除这种危险和促进各国间的谅解的情况。”
    复信表示瑞士愿意根据它传统的中立政策来为有关国家进行接触提供便利，不过目前它不宜在召开会议的问题上“采取主动”。
