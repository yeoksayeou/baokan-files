Medicinal corn is a treasure; it fears neither drought nor flood; uses few seeds but produces a lot; planting it provides firewood; it fears neither pests nor wind; it's both delicious and easy to grow; it's nutritious and can cure diseases; planting it is truly useful.

(Reported by this newspaper) In Shangshui County, Xuchang Special District, Henan Province, most of the agricultural production cooperatives last year experimented with planting more than 5,600 mu of "medicinal corn" (i.e., Job's tears). Although they encountered severe floods and droughts, the harvest was still very good. More than 100 mu in Yangying Township were not flooded, with an average yield of over 700 jin per mu. The Communist Party branch secretary of Chengliu Township experimented with planting half a mu and harvested 520 jin. The Guanpo Agricultural Cooperative in Yangzhuang Township experimented with planting 9.2 mu, which was flooded for 39 days, including 10 days submerged completely and 13 days with water five feet deep. After the water receded, without additional fertilization, each mu still yielded 451 jin, only the harvest period was about 20 days later than the unflooded areas. The several mu planted in Chengguan Township were flooded for more than ten days when they were still seedlings, but they were also harvested later. From the existing materials, "medicinal corn" has many advantages: Flood resistance - not only can it resist floods after it grows up, but it doesn't matter if it is submerged when it is young. Drought resistance - it can still grow when other crops wither due to drought, and it can survive even if it is transplanted on a sunny day. Insect resistance - its roots and leaves have a certain medicinal smell, pests do not eat it, and livestock, chickens, ducks, etc. do not spoil it. Wind resistance - after it matures, the seeds do not fall off even in strong winds. It has many stalks, with more than 10,000 jin produced per mu, and the quality is very good, similar to thin reeds. Its planting method is simple, and it can be planted in any land that can grow sorghum, millet and other crops. The sowing and harvesting periods are similar to those of sorghum, and the requirements for intertillage, weeding, and topdressing are also similar to those of sorghum. Very few seeds are required, and two jin of seeds can plant one mu; it has many tillers, with fifty or sixty branches per plant, growing into a large clump. It can also be grown as a late autumn crop, sown after the wheat harvest. In 1956, the Second Cooperative of Longlei Township sowed 15 mu in the summer, with an average yield of more than 260 jin per mu. Local people say: "'Medicinal corn' is easy to take care of, it's very 'rascal', and even a layabout can grow it." However, it is extremely fond of fertilizer, and the more fertilizer applied, the higher the yield. The rice yield rate is also not low, with 75 jin of rice produced from 100 jin of grain; it is not only delicious and fragrant, but also very nutritious. Wang Shouli, director of the Guanpo Agricultural Cooperative's Supervision Committee, had a young daughter who was sick. Taking medicine was ineffective, but she drank "medicinal corn" porridge for half a month and got better, and also gained weight.

There is another noteworthy aspect of "medicinal corn": In some fields where the roots were not dug out after harvesting, it sprouted new shoots, which are still growing, some already more than a foot high. Some agricultural cooperatives are observing whether these regenerated seedlings can survive the winter and bear seeds.

Shangshui County did not have "medicinal corn" in the past. It was introduced by Shi Guoyi, a farmer in the county, from Bo'ai County in 1954. In the spring of 1957, the Shangshui County Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered that it was suitable for the local needs of increasing production and changing planting, and decided to experiment with planting it in all townships throughout the county. At present, agricultural cooperatives throughout Shangshui County are actively carrying out various preparations to massively promote it in 1958, in order to transform the low-lying areas that are flooded every year and have very little harvest.

### 河南商水大量种植“药玉米”

    河南商水大量种植“药玉米”
    药玉米，是个宝；不怕旱，不怕涝；用籽少，产量高；种了它，有柴烧；不怕虫，不怕风；又好吃，又好种；养分多，能治病；种了它，真有用。
    本报讯　河南省许昌专区商水县各乡的大部分农业生产合作社，去年试种了五千六百多亩“药玉米”（即薏苡），虽然碰上了严重的水灾和旱灾，收成仍然很好。杨营乡试种的一百多亩没有被淹，平均亩产七百斤以上；承留乡中共支部书记试种了半亩，就收了五百二十斤。杨庄乡官坡农业社试种的九亩二分地，被淹了三十九天，其中有十天没了顶，十三天积水五尺来深；水退后没有加工施肥，每亩仍收获了四百五十一斤，只是收割期比未淹的晚了二十来天。城关乡试种的几亩，还是幼苗的时候就淹没了十几天，后来也收了。从现有材料看来，“药玉米”具有许多优点：抗涝——不仅长成以后能抗涝，幼小的时候淹一下也不要紧。抗旱——在别的庄稼由于干旱枯萎的时候，它仍能生长，晴天移栽它也能活。抗虫——它的根叶有某种药味，害虫不吃它，牲口、鸡、鸭等也不糟踏它。抗风——成熟以后，遇到大风籽粒不脱落。它的秸棵多，一亩地能产万斤以上，质量很好，同细芦苇差不多。他的种法简单，凡是能种高粱、谷子等作物的土地都能种它，下种和收割期与高粱相似，在中耕、除草、追肥等方面，也同高粱的要求差不多。所需籽种很少，两斤种子就能种一亩地；分蘖多，一棵有五六十个岔枝，长成一大蓬。把它作为晚秋作物，麦收后下种，也可以长成。1956年，龙肋乡二社夏播十五亩，平均亩产二百六十多斤。当地群众说：“‘药玉米’好侍候，‘泼皮’的很，二流子也能种它。”不过，它极喜爱肥料，施肥越多产量越高。出米率也不低，一百斤谷能出七十五斤米；不仅好吃，味道香，而且营养价值很高。官坡农业社监察委员会主任王守立的小女有病，吃药不见效，一连喝了半月“药玉米”稀粥，病好了，人也胖了。
    “药玉米”还有一个值得注意的地方：在一些收割后没有刨根的地里，它又发出新芽，目前还在生长，有的已有一尺多高。有些农业社正在观察这再生的苗能否过冬和结籽。
    商水县过去没有“药玉米”，它是这个县的农民史国义1954年由博爱县引进的。1957年春天，中共商水县委发现它正适合当地增产改种的需要，决定在全县各乡试种。目前，商水全县各农业社正在积极进行各项准备工作，要在1958年大量推广它，以利于改造那些年年受涝、收成很少的洼地。
