Xinhua News Agency, London, January 25th: The "World News" weekly published a report by the Economic Committee of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party on the economic situation in the capitalist world.

The report, when discussing the British economic situation, stated that "Throughout the post-war period, the economic difficulties occurring in Britain have constantly affected the sterling area, and the difficulties in the sterling area have in turn affected Britain."

The report pointed out that Britain received American aid when its economy was in crisis, but in order to obtain this aid, Britain sacrificed its economic and political independence and devalued the pound.

The report said that from 1950 to 1956, the reason why the capitalist world (including Britain) experienced some prosperity was primarily due to the arms race (which was at its most intense after the outbreak of the Korean War) and the re-equipment of industry. However, in 1955, due to a sharp increase in imports, Britain's balance of payments once again showed an unfavorable trend. In order to reverse this situation, the government took measures to reduce domestic consumption and create a pool of unemployed workers in order to force workers to abandon the struggle for higher wages. The government's "hard" fiscal policy hindered the further development of domestic industry and production.

After the Suez adventure in 1956, Britain experienced particularly great difficulties. The pound remains under threat.

The report went on to say that production in the capitalist world is currently declining, a phenomenon that is a direct result of the production decline that began in the United States in mid-1957.

The report emphasized that the British government still intends to break the current situation and seek a way out by sacrificing the interests of the workers. For example, it is attempting to freeze wages.

### 英共经济委员会指出  美国“援助”使英镑贬了值

    英共经济委员会指出
    美国“援助”使英镑贬了值
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社伦敦25日讯：“世界新闻”周刊刊载了英国共产党执行委员会经济委员会关于资本主义世界经济状况的一篇报告。
    报告中谈到英国经济状况时说，“在整个战后时期，英国国内所发生的经济困难不断在影响着英镑区，而英镑区的困难反过来又影响着英国。”
    报告指出，英国经济处在危机状态时得到了美国的援助，但是，英国为了取得这种援助，牺牲了经济和政治上的独立，而且使英镑贬了值。
    报告说，从1950年到1956年，资本主义世界（包括英国）之所以有某些景气现象，这首先是由于有军备竞赛（这种军备竞赛在朝鲜战争爆发之后带有最强烈的性质）和工业的更换装备。但是，在1955年，由于进口额猛烈增长，英国的收支平衡又开始出现了不利的倾向。为了扭转这种局面，政府曾采取一些措施来缩减国内的消费和造成失业工人队伍，以便迫使劳动者放弃提高工资的斗争。政府实行的“硬性”财政政策阻碍了国内工业和生产的进一步发展。
    在1956年的苏伊士冒险以后，英国发生了特别大的困难。英镑仍然受到威胁。
    报告接着说，目前资本主义世界生产下降了，这种现象是美国1957年年中开始发生的生产下降的直接结果。
    报告强调指出，英国政府这一次还是打算用牺牲劳动者的利益的办法来打破现状，谋求出路。例如，它企图冻结工资。
