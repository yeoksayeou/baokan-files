Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: New Delhi News: Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated on the 9th that he welcomes the suggestion made by British Prime Minister Macmillan regarding the East and West concluding a non-aggression treaty, and hopes that this suggestion can be realized.

Nehru said at a banquet held for the British Prime Minister that due to the enormous developments in technology and weapons of mass destruction, the question of abandoning war has become extremely urgent. In this situation, he expressed his welcome for Macmillan's recent suggestion regarding the East and West concluding a non-aggression treaty. He said, "We warmly hope that this will produce results, and that the shadow of war will disappear from the earth."

In his reply, Macmillan emphasized the "importance" of the British Commonwealth and praised India's decision to remain in the British Commonwealth after independence. Macmillan also said that countries must learn to live according to the principles that India calls "Panchsheel" (Five Principles).

Xinhua News Agency, London, January 9th: The latest issue of the "Tribune" weekly criticized the British government for backing down from the proposal of concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union after being pressured by Washington.

The "Tribune" weekly said that the main part of Macmillan's broadcast speech on January 4th was "a negative reaffirmation of the well-known Western attitude with clichés." He did not indicate that he would make concessions to the Soviet Union's views on major issues such as Germany, the Middle East, or disarmament. However, he suggested starting to conclude a solemn non-aggression treaty, which shows that he values signing this treaty before dealing with other issues.

The weekly pointed out that the United States' reaction to Macmillan's idea was so hostile that the British government rushed to back down.

The "Tribune" weekly pointed out in this regard that when Britain behaved so dishearteningly, the Soviet Union took more concrete actions, announcing a further reduction of 300,000 troops. This is in stark contrast to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's plan to strengthen the West German army and make every effort to establish rocket bases.

    尼赫鲁对麦克米伦表示
    欢迎东西方订互不侵犯条约
    英“论坛”周刊批评政府向美国压力退缩
    据新华社10日讯　新德里消息：印度总理尼赫鲁9日表示欢迎英国首相麦克米伦提出的关于东西方缔结互不侵犯条约的建议，并且希望这个建议能够实现。
    尼赫鲁在他为英国首相举行的宴会上说，由于技术和大规模毁灭性武器方面的巨大发展，废弃战争的问题已经变得急不容缓了。在这种情况下，他表示欢迎麦克米伦最近提出的关于东西方缔结互不侵犯条约的建议。他说：“我们热情地希望这将会产生结果，而使战争的阴影会从地面上消失。”
    麦克米伦在致答词时强调英联邦的“重要性”，并且称赞印度作出的在独立后仍然留在英联邦内的决定。麦克米伦还说，各国必须学会根据印度称之为“潘查希拉”（五项原则）的那些原则来生活。
    据新华社伦敦9日电　最新的一期“论坛”周报批评英国政府在受到了华盛顿方面的压力以后就从关于同苏联缔结互不侵犯条约的主张往后退。
    “论坛”周报说，麦克米伦1月4日的广播演说的主要部分是“用陈词滥调来消极地重申人所皆知的西方态度”。他并没有表示要在德国、中东或者裁军等重大问题上向苏联的看法让步。但是他建议开始缔结庄严的互不侵犯条约，这表明，他重视在处理其它问题以前签订这个条约。
    这家周报指出，美国对麦克米伦这个主意的反应是如此敌视，以致英国政府赶忙退缩了。
    “论坛”周报就此指出，当英国表现得如此泄气的时候，苏联却采取了更为实在的行动，它宣布再裁军三十万。这同北大西洋公约组织加强西德军队和竭力推行建立火箭基地的计划恰恰成为鲜明的对照。
