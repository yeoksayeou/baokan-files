Children who have a bedwetting habit suffer a lot. Especially on windy and snowy days in winter, a wet bed makes it easy for children to catch a cold, and it is very inconvenient to change and wash.

Some children can control urination very well during the day, but cannot control it at night. Some children still wet the bed frequently at the age of four or five. If a child over three years old still wets the bed frequently, he should be taken to a pediatrician for examination. Bedwetting is very common in children who are nervous and tense. If there is no physical problem, it is due to a lack of training.

Generally speaking, a one-and-a-half-year-old child can know how to control urination. A two-year-old child will say when he wants to urinate, but he should still be reminded often. When a child learns to control urination during the day, he will gradually be able to control it at night.

Training a child not to wet the bed should start when the baby is seven or eight months old. Put him on the potty at a fixed time and more often. In the beginning, it is best when the baby has just woken up and has not wet the bed. In winter, babies often have chills before urinating. As soon as you notice it, immediately let him sit on the potty.

During training, keep the baby in a happy mood and create a more comfortable environment. For example, don't let the child sit on a potty that is too cold; at the beginning, the mother should hold him on the potty to avoid causing fear. Secondly, the child should not sit on the potty for too long, preferably one or two minutes each time. If he has not urinated yet, you can pick him up first and try again later. A one-year-old child usually urinates every one to three hours. As the child gets older, the number of urinations gradually decreases. You should gradually grasp the child's urination pattern.

Nighttime bedwetting can be trained at the age of two. It is best to let him urinate before going to bed. Before the mother goes to bed, ask him to urinate once. If he still wets the bed, ask him to urinate one or two more times during the night.

Suppose your child is five years old and still has a bedwetting habit. This is not the child's fault. Never blame, stimulate, or humiliate him, but train him patiently. The first thing to do is to see exactly when he wets the bed. Suppose he goes to bed at seven o'clock, and when you wake him up at nine o'clock to urinate, he has already wet the bed, then you should wake him up at eight o'clock tomorrow night. Later, gradually extend the time and reduce the number of times, so that he develops a habit and does not urinate all night. Before the child goes to bed, it is best not to say to the child "You must not pee in bed," but to say to him, "You have to get up to pee at night." If he does not wet the bed, then encourage him. This is of great help in training. When waking the child up to pee, wait until the child is awake before putting him on the potty. Children wet the bed not when they are sound asleep, but when they are half-awake. If he is not fully awake, it is easy to associate sitting on the potty with a dream, which will affect his ability to correct the bedwetting habit.

In addition, the following points should also be noted during the training period:

    1. Do not give the child a lot of water or liquid food after 5 pm.

    2. Do not let the child play too tired or play various tense games at night. It is best to let him play quietly or look at picture books before going to bed.

    3. When sleeping, do not wear clothes and pants that are too tight, or cover too much. If the quilt is kicked off and the body gets cold, it will also cause bedwetting.

    4. Eating too many sweets and drinking caffeinated drinks such as coffee and tea will also often promote bedwetting.

As long as mothers patiently train their children and pay attention to their diet and life, the bedwetting habit is not difficult to correct.

    孩子尿床的习惯怎样改？
    启元
    孩子有尿床的习惯，很受罪。特别是在冬天刮风、下雪的日子，尿湿了床孩子容易着凉，换洗也很不方便。
    有些孩子，在白天很能自己控制小便，夜里却控制不了。有的孩子到了四、五岁，还有经常尿床的情况。如果三岁以上的孩子还经常遗尿，应该带他到儿科医生那里去检查一下。神经质和神经紧张的孩子，遗尿是很普通的。如果在身体上没有毛病，那就是缺乏训练的原故。
    一般地说，一岁半的孩子，就能够知道控制小便了。两岁的孩子想要小便的时候，他会说，但还应该常常提醒他。小孩学会了在白天控制小便，渐渐地在夜间也就能控制了。
    训练孩子不遗尿的习惯，应该从婴儿七、八个月的时候开始。按一定的时间，把他放在便盆上，次数要多。开始时，最好在婴儿刚睡醒，而没有尿床的时候。在冬天，婴儿在小便前往往有寒战的现象，一发现就马上让他坐在便盆上。
    在训练的时候，要让婴儿的心情愉快，同时要布置较为舒适的环境。例如：不宜让孩子坐在太凉的便盆上；开始时，妈妈应该扶着他坐便盆，免得他产生恐惧心理。其次，孩子坐便盆的时间不能太长，每次最好是一、二分钟。如果还未小便，可以先把他抱起来，等一会儿再试。一岁的孩子普通是每一小时至三小时小便一次。孩子较大一些，小便的次数就逐渐减少。应该逐渐地掌握孩子的拉尿规律。
    夜间孩子不尿床，可以在两岁的时候开始训练。在上床睡觉前，最好让他先小便。在母亲临睡前，叫他小便一次。假使仍然尿床的话，在夜间再多叫他一、二次。
    假定你的孩子五岁了，还有遗尿的习惯。这并不是孩子的过失，你千万别责备、刺激、羞辱他，而应该耐心地训练他。首先要做的事，是看他究竟是什么时候遗尿的。假定他七点钟睡觉，九点钟叫他起来小便时已尿湿了，那么你明晚就应改在八点叫他。以后逐渐延长时间，减少次数，使他养成习惯，以至通夜不尿。在孩子临睡前，你最好不要对孩子说“不可以尿在床上”，而要对他说“夜间要起来小便”。如果他没有尿床，那就要鼓励他。这对训练有很大的帮助。在叫孩子尿时，要等孩子清醒后，才把他放在便盆上。小孩遗尿，并不是在熟睡的时候，而是在半醒时。假若他没有完全清醒，就很容易把坐便盆同梦境相联，影响他改正遗尿的习惯。
    此外，在训练期间还应注意以下几点：
    一、下午五时以后，不给孩子喝很多水，吃流体的食物。
    二、晚上不要让孩子玩得太疲乏，或做各种紧张的游戏。最好是在睡觉前让他静静地玩或看看图画书等。
    三、在睡觉的时候，不要使衣服裤子穿得太紧，或盖得太多。如果把被子踢去，身体受凉，也会引起遗尿的。
    四、小孩吃多了甜食，喝了咖啡茶等兴奋作用的饮食也常会促使遗尿。
    做妈妈的只要耐心地训练孩子，注意他们的饮食和生活，遗尿的习惯是不难改正的。
