A Model of New Urban-Rural Relations
Songbu Township Everyone Contributes to Support the Countryside
Promoting Agricultural Production and Town Work

(Our Dispatch) Songbu Township in Macheng County, Hubei Province, is setting an example of new socialist urban-rural relations by having everyone contribute to support the countryside, promoting agricultural production in the surrounding villages and improving various aspects of town work.

Songbu Township is located in a cotton and grain-rich area of Macheng County and has a population of over 8,000 residents. It is a major distribution center for goods, known as "Little Hankou." However, before 1957, due to an unclear understanding of serving agricultural production, the town's work was not well-oriented towards the countryside. For example, 80% of the town's handicraft products were not the means of production urgently needed by farmers, but rather general consumer goods. The commercial departments waited for customers to come to their doors and never proactively delivered goods to the countryside. After selling double-wheeled double-shared plows, they did not send people to the countryside to teach the techniques of using them. This created a disconnect between urban and rural areas. Farmers in the surrounding villages were very dissatisfied. They criticized the town as: "Cadres wandering the streets, not caring about production."

In early 1957, the CCP Songbu Township Committee decided to vigorously reverse the situation of detachment from the countryside. First, it organized all cadres, workers, students, and residents of the town to study the agricultural bumper harvest targets for 1957 proposed by the Macheng County Committee. During the study, the focus was on analyzing the reasons for the disconnection between urban and rural areas, and criticizing the ideological viewpoints and practices of detachment from the countryside and disregard for labor. After initially correcting their thinking, the Township Committee put forward a revolutionary slogan to the people of the town: "Mobilize all forces, think of all ways, overcome all difficulties, support agricultural production, and do everything for a great agricultural harvest." To implement this slogan with action, the Township Committee required cadres to have four things (a dirt basket, a carrying pole, a hoe, and a sickle), be able to do five things (accumulate fertilizer, apply fertilizer, cut wheat, weed, and understand general agricultural techniques), and arrange three things well (work, study, and production).

Subsequently, everyone from the Township Committee Secretary and heads of various departments to general cadres, handicraft workers, barbers, supply and marketing cooperative personnel and other commercial personnel, students, and residents participated in supporting the countryside. They not only seized the agricultural production season to vigorously support the countryside but also regarded repairing farm tools, accumulating fertilizer, delivering fertilizer, promoting new farm tools, and improving agricultural techniques for farmers as regular work.

Twenty-three handicraft production cooperatives in the town, specializing in bamboo, wood, iron, and other industries, went to the countryside to manufacture and repair farm tools for farmers. Twenty-three members of the Fangmu Handicraft Production Cooperative went to the three townships of Lisheng, Baijiao, and Luoban and repaired 37 waterwheels, 96 plows and harrows, and 572 other farm tools. Twenty-two members of the Bamboo Production Cooperative went deep into the Guishan area, sixty or seventy li away from the town, and worked for three months, making and repairing 25,000 new and old farm tools for farmers. Nine of the eleven red furnace smithies in the town were moved to five townships for long periods of time to serve agricultural production. Workers at the Songbu Automobile Center Station's maintenance shop recently braved the severe cold to repair a frozen water tank for the Hongxing No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in the open air. They also told farmers how to protect the water tank. The automobile maintenance shop and several nearby agricultural cooperatives signed a contract, stipulating that if the farmers' machines broke down, the maintenance shop would send people to repair them free of charge at any time and guaranteed to teach them as they repaired. The farmers also made a guarantee to the maintenance shop that "production and road maintenance will not be delayed," consciously maintaining and repairing roads.

In order to promote new farm tools in the countryside, the town selected thirteen skilled workers to form a technical research group, specifically responsible for improving and trial-manufacturing new farm tools. In 1957, they improved and trial-manufactured a total of twenty-eight new farm tools, such as seed drills and bulldozers. In the past, some agricultural cooperatives bought double-wheeled double-shared plows but did not know how to use them, so they had to be left idle. To solve this problem, Hao Liusheng, the head of the production materials group of the supply and marketing cooperative, went to the Lianmeng No. 2 Agricultural Cooperative in Tiemen Township to test the double-wheeled double-shared plow in the field, while teaching the cooperative director and production team leader the techniques. As a result, all eight idle double-wheeled double-shared plows in the cooperative were put into use. Subsequently, agricultural cooperatives throughout Tiemen Township sent people to learn the techniques, and all sixty-four long-idle double-wheeled double-shared plows in the township were put into production, and forty new ones were purchased.

In order to respond to the county's call to eliminate the third-class cotton seedlings, Songbu Township launched the promotion of granular fertilizer. However, the local farmers had never used this fertilizer and were unwilling to buy it. The cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative first went to the Hongxing No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Lisheng Township and selected six fen of cotton fields for experiments, applying forty jin of granular fertilizer. Seven days later, the cotton in this plot grew better. The town immediately organized visits to promote this experience. Within six days, 680,000 jin of granular fertilizer were sold out. As a result, all the third-class seedlings on more than 7,000 mu of cotton land grew well.

The commercial departments also changed their past business style of waiting for customers to come to their doors, not only delivering goods to their doorsteps but also delivering goods to the fields. Last winter, when the agricultural cooperatives distributed income, the supply and marketing cooperative saw that the farmers were very busy during the day, so they sent people to Hongxing No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative to open a night market, selling 2,300 yuan worth of goods in one night. The entire town's financial and trade system learned the supply and marketing cooperative's method of going deep into the countryside to open night markets, with ninety-six people successively going to the countryside to deliver goods more than seven hundred and twenty times, selling more than 192,000 yuan worth of goods. During the busy farming season, the workers of the Dongshen Barber Shop carried their barbering tools to the countryside and set up twelve small thatched sheds in the fields, making it convenient for farmers to get haircuts during their rest. The farmers were very happy and said: "Thatched sheds are set up in the fields, I come to rest and he gives me a haircut, production and haircuts are not delayed, and production development is great."

In the spring and summer of 1957, the Macheng County Committee proposed seizing the opportunity to "three-grab": harvesting wheat, weeding, and transplanting rice seedlings. The entire town immediately mobilized more than four thousand workers, students, residents, and cadres to help farmers in the three townships of Baijiao, Lisheng, and Fengjia Liangting. During the fight against drought and rescue of seedlings, the town immediately organized more than four thousand people to go to the dam overnight. In one day and two nights, a large dam was built, guaranteeing a bumper harvest on 20,000 mu of land in the three townships of Lisheng, Fengjia Liangting, and Tiemen. The people of the town also combined the patriotic sanitation campaign to eliminate the four pests, often accumulating and delivering fertilizer to support the countryside. In 1957, the town delivered a total of 510,000 dan of fertilizer to the countryside, which could provide fertilizer for 2,000 mu of land. In January of this year, more than four thousand people in the town delivered more than 7,000 dan of fertilizer to the countryside again. This year, the town plans to accumulate 500 dan of fertilizer per household, accumulating a total of one million dan. Processing this one million dan of fertilizer into ten million jin of granular fertilizer can supply the needs of 50,000 mu of farmland.

While vigorously supporting the countryside, various tasks in Songbu Township have seen significant development. For example, the town's handicraft production cooperatives, due to production being oriented towards the countryside, will see a 43.4% increase in the total value of production this year compared to last year. In the work of accumulating and delivering fertilizer to the countryside, the town cleaned up twenty-six drainage ditches and built more than thirty public toilets last year, catching more than 50,000 rats.

The experience of Songbu Township in supporting the countryside has received the attention of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. Recently, the Provincial Committee is preparing to hold an on-site meeting to promote their experience to small and medium-sized towns throughout the province.

    新型城乡关系的榜样
    宋埠镇人人出力支援农村
    促进了农业生产，也促进了城镇工作
    本报讯　湖北省麻城县宋埠镇人人出力支援农村，成为社会主义新型的城乡关系的榜样，促进了四乡农业生产，也促进了城镇各项工作。
    宋埠镇位于麻城县棉、粮丰产地区，全镇有八千多居民，是较大的物资集散市场，素有“小汉口”之称。但是，在1957年以前，由于为农业生产服务的观点不明确，镇上各项工作没有很好地面向农村。例如全镇手工业产品的80％，就不是农民迫切需要的生产资料，而是些一般的生活资料；商业部门坐门等客，从不主动送货下乡；销出了双轮双铧犁，也不派人下乡传授使用技术。这样就形成了城乡脱节的局面。四乡农民很不满意。他们批评这个市镇是：“干部满街转，生产他不管。”
    1957年初，中共宋埠镇委决心大力扭转脱离农村的局面，首先组织全镇干部、工人、学生和居民，学习麻城县委提出的1957年农业大丰收的指标。在学习中，着重分析了城乡关系脱节的原因，批判了脱离农村和轻视劳动的思想观点和各种作法。在初步端正思想以后，镇委向全镇人民提出了一个革命的口号：“动员一切力量，想尽一切办法，克服一切困难，支援农业生产，一切为了农业生产大丰收。”为了用行动来实现这个口号，镇委要求干部做到四有（有土箕、有扁担、有锄头、有镰刀），五会（会积肥、会下肥、会割麦、会锄草、会一般的农业技术），三安排（工作、学习、生产安排好）。
    接着，从镇委书记、各部门负责干部到一般干部、手工业工人、理发工人、供销社和其它商业人员、学生、居民等都参加支援农村。他们不仅抓住农业生产季节大力支援农村，而且把为农民修理农具、积肥、送肥、推广新式农具、改进农业技术等，当成经常性的工作。
    全镇竹、木、铁等业二十三个手工业生产合作社纷纷下乡为农民制造和修理农具。方木手工业生产合作社社员二十三人，到李胜、拜郊、罗畈三个乡，共修理了水车三十七部、犁耙九十六件及其他农具五百七十二件。竹业生产合作社社员二十二人，深入离镇六、七十里远的龟山区工作了三个月，为农民制新、修旧农具二万五千件。全镇手工业十一盘红炉，有九盘长期搬到五个乡里，为农业生产服务。宋埠汽车中心站保养场的工人，最近冒着严寒，在露天里为红星一社修好了被冻坏的抽水机水箱。他们还告诉农民保护水箱的办法。这个汽车保养场和附近几个农业社订立了合同，农民的机器坏了，保养场就随时派人义务修理，并保证随修随教。农民们也向保养场提出了“生产、养路两不误”的保证，自觉地养路、修路。
    为了在农村推广新式农具，全镇挑选了十三名技术工人，组成一个技术研究组，专门负责改良和试制新式农具。1957年，他们共改良和试制了条播器、推土车等二十八种新式农具。过去，有些农业社买了双轮双铧犁不会用，只得闲置起来。为了解决这个问题，供销社生产资料组组长郝流胜，到铁门乡联盟二社实地试验双轮双铧犁，同时向社主任、生产队长传授技术。结果，全社闲置的八部双轮双铧犁都拿出来使用了。接着，铁门全乡的农业社都派人来学习技术，全乡闲置已久的六十四部双轮双铧犁都投入了生产，而且又买了四十部新的。
    宋埠镇为了响应县里提出的消灭棉花三类苗的号召，展开了推广颗粒肥的工作。但是当地农民没有用过这种肥料，都不愿意买。供销社的干部就先到李胜乡红星一社找了六分棉花地作试验，上了四十斤颗粒肥。七天后，这块地里的棉花长得更好。镇上立即组织参观，推广这个经验。六天之中，六十八万斤颗粒肥都买光了。于是，七千多亩棉花的三类苗就全部长好了。
    商业部门也改变了过去那种等客上门的经营作风，不仅把货送上门，而且把货送到田边。去冬，农业社分配收入时，供销社看见农民白天很忙，就派人到红星一社开辟夜间市场，一夜就卖了二千三百元的货。全镇财贸系统都学习供销社深入农村开辟夜间市场的办法，有九十六个人相继下乡送货七百二十多次，卖货十九万二千多元。东深理发社工人在农忙时，把理发用具挑下乡，在田边搭了十二个小草棚，便利农民休息时理发。农民很高兴地说：“草棚畈（田野）中搭，我来休息他理发，生产理发两不误，发展生产叫呱呱。”
    1957年春夏之交，麻城县委提出抓紧时机“三抢”：割麦、锄草、插秧。全镇马上动员了四千多工人、学生、居民、干部，到拜郊、李胜、冯家凉亭三个乡帮助农民。抗旱救苗时，镇上又立即组织了四千多人连夜上堤，一天两夜的功夫，修了一条大坝，保证了李胜、冯家凉亭和铁门三个乡二万亩地的丰收。全镇人民还结合除四害讲卫生运动，经常积肥、送肥支援农村。1957年全镇共送肥料五十一万担下乡，可供二千亩地施肥。今年1月，镇上四千多人又一次送了七千多担肥料下乡。今年全镇计划每户积肥五百担，共积肥一百万担。把这一百万担肥料加工成一千万斤颗粒肥，可供应五万亩田地的需要。
    在大力支援农村的同时，宋埠镇的各项工作有了显著的发展。例如镇上的手工业生产合作社，由于生产面向农村，今年的生产总值将比去年提高43.4％。在积肥、送肥下乡的工作中，去年全镇清理了阴沟二十六条，修建公共厕所三十多个，捕捉老鼠五万多只。
    宋埠镇支援农村的经验，得到了中共湖北省委的重视，最近省委正准备召开现场会议，向全省中小城镇推广他们的经验。
