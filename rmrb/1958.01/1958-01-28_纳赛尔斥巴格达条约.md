Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 27th: Egyptian President Nasser said on the 26th that the main purpose of the Baghdad Pact is primarily to serve the interests of major powers, not the interests of smaller member states.

Nasser said that the Baghdad Pact seeks to control the Middle East region. He said he opposes military treaties and military alliances.

Nasser made these remarks while receiving a visiting American press delegation in Egypt.

In his conversation with these American journalists, Nasser compared the different attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union toward Egypt. He pointed out that the United States refused to provide Egypt with the funds needed to build the Aswan High Dam and refused to supply Egypt with wheat after the British, French, and Israeli invasion of Egypt. In contrast, the Soviet Union supplied Egypt with 400,000 tons of wheat without any conditions and provided loans without any political or economic strings attached.

Nasser said that Egypt is happy to accept American aid, but cannot sacrifice its national dignity to obtain such aid. He hopes that the United States will unfreeze Egyptian funds in the United States.

    纳赛尔斥巴格达条约
    据新华社开罗27日电　埃及总统纳赛尔26日说，巴格达条约的主要目的首先是为大国的利益服务，而不是为较小的成员国的利益服务。
    纳赛尔说，巴格达条约想要控制中东地区。他说，他反对军事条约和军事联盟。
    纳赛尔是在接见正在埃及访问的美国新闻代表团时说这番话的。
    纳赛尔在对这批美国记者谈话时把美国和苏联对埃及的不同态度作了对比。他指出，美国拒绝向埃及提供建筑阿斯旺高水坝所需资金并且在英、法、以色列三国对埃及发动侵略后拒绝供应埃及小麦，而苏联却不加任何条件供应埃及四十万吨小麦并且提供不附带任何政治或经济条件的贷款。
    纳赛尔说，埃及乐于接受美国的帮助，但是不能牺牲它国家的尊严来取得这种帮助。他希望美国会把埃及在美国的资金解冻。
