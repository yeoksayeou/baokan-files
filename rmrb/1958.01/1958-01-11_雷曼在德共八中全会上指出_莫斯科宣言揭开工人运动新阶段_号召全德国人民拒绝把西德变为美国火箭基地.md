Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 10th: "Neues Deutschland" published excerpts from the report by Hermann Lehmann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the German Communist Party not long ago.

In his report, Lehmann spoke about the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the Moscow Declaration.

Lehmann said that the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries is of extreme importance to all fraternal parties. He pointed out that we believe the Moscow Declaration greatly contributes to further strengthening the Marxist-Leninist unity of our ranks in the struggle against all right-leaning opportunism and overcoming dogmatism and sectarianism. This document answers the main theoretical and practical questions in the workers' movement after socialism became a world system.

Lehmann also pointed out the great significance of the Peace Manifesto. He said that this manifesto expresses the determination of the Communist and Workers' Parties to make every effort to safeguard and consolidate peace.

He emphasized that the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties and the documents adopted at the meeting signify a new stage in the international working class and working people's struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

A large part of Lehmann's report dealt with the situation in West Germany and the tasks of the German Communist Party. He pointed out that in West Germany, distrust of the Federal Government's policies is growing, and people are realizing that the Federal Republic of Germany should take a new path and reject the war policies of American imperialism. Lehmann said that millions of people in the Federal Republic of Germany are currently attracted to the idea of establishing a non-nuclear zone in Europe, and they advocate the withdrawal of foreign troops from Germany, the abolition of military treaties, and the establishment of a collective security system.

Lehmann went on to say that the German Communist Party advocates that the Federal Republic should reject rocket weapons and refuse to provide bases for launching such weapons. Communists should strive to make these demands the slogan of all Germans.

Lehmann said that the existence of the German Democratic Republic greatly helps all Germans committed to defending and consolidating peace. Therefore, supporting the German Democratic Republic as a bastion of social progress is the responsibility of every conscious worker.

    雷曼在德共八中全会上指出
    莫斯科宣言揭开工人运动新阶段
    号召全德国人民拒绝把西德变为美国火箭基地
    据新华社10日讯　据塔斯社柏林8日讯：“新德意志报”发表了德国共产党中央第一书记雷曼不久前在德共八中全会上的报告摘要。
    雷曼在报告中谈到伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年庆祝典礼和莫斯科宣言。
    雷曼说，社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议对所有的兄弟党有着极其重要的意义。他指出，我们认为莫斯科宣言大大地有助于进一步加强我们队伍在反对一切右倾机会主义、克服教条主义和宗派主义的斗争中的马克思列宁主义的团结一致。这个文件答复了当前社会主义成为世界体系后工人运动中的理论和实践方面的主要问题。
    雷曼还指出和平宣言的巨大意义。他说，这个宣言表达了共产党和工人党准备尽一切努力来维护和巩固和平的决心。
    他强调说，共产党和工人党莫斯科代表会议和会上所通过的文件意味着国际工人阶级和劳动人民争取和平、民主和社会主义斗争的新阶段。
    雷曼的报告有很大一部分谈到了西德的局势和德国共产党的任务。他指出，在西德，人们对于联邦政府政策的不信任正在增长，他们认识到德意志联邦共和国应当走新的道路和拒绝美帝国主义者的战争政策。雷曼说，目前德意志联邦共和国的千百万人，都被在欧洲建立非原子武装区的主张所吸引，他们主张外国军队撤出德国，废除军事条约和建立集体安全体系。
    雷曼接着说，德国共产党主张联邦共和国应当拒绝火箭武器和拒绝提供发射这种武器的基地。共产党员应当争取使这些要求成为全体德国人的口号。
    雷曼说，德意志民主共和国的存在大大地帮助了所有致力于保卫和巩固和平的德国人，因此，支持作为社会进步堡垒的德意志民主共和国是每一个有觉悟工人的责任。
