Preface: Noting that culture is a fundamental principle in the lives of all countries, a principle that awakens human conscience, strengthens the spirit, raises moral standards, improves thought, and opens up vast prospects in material, intellectual, and spiritual creation.

Noting that any civilization worthy of the name cannot exist unless it is built on a fundamental culture that can nurture it, develop it, make it possible to progress, and enable countries to fully realize the ideals of peace, friendship, freedom, equality, and justice, and recognize that they need mutual understanding and cooperation to promote and realize these ideals.

Noting that the culture we understand is the broadest sense of culture, including literature, art, science, and other branches of knowledge that elevate the human spirit, cultivate noble tastes, and liberate the soul from evil and injustice.

Noting that civilization is a common heritage, which no country can monopolize, to which all humanity has an inherent right, and that all countries should wholeheartedly cooperate and do their utmost to develop, enrich, and promote this heritage so that all humanity, regardless of race, color, or religion, can benefit from it.

Noting the important role of culture in promoting political, economic, and social solidarity.

The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference:

I. Reaffirms the resolution on cultural cooperation adopted by the Bandung Conference, namely, the conference:

	A. Calls for promoting cultural cooperation and restoring ancient cultural contacts based on modern cultural conditions.

	B. Believes that the existence of colonialism in many parts of Asia and Africa has hindered cultural cooperation and suppressed national cultures, and condemns racism as a means of cultural oppression.

	D. Requests the more advanced Asian and African countries in education, technology, and scientific institutions to provide facilities to admit students from countries that have not yet been able to develop such institutions.

II. In order to achieve cultural cooperation as fully as possible, it is recommended that it be achieved through:

III. Recommends compiling an encyclopedic book of history and geography to record the history of Asian and African countries and peoples, to describe their lives, to record their resources coveted by colonialism, to explain the contribution of each nation to its national culture and the role it played in its national struggle, with particular emphasis on the disastrous consequences of colonialism and the modern struggle for freedom; and stipulates that this book should be based on the principles established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization for the writing of history in order to strengthen kinship among human beings; for this purpose:

	It is recommended to organize an Asian-African Committee of Historians to formulate a plan for compiling the aforementioned book and be responsible for completing the work.

XVI. Condemns the closure of schools, the expulsion of teachers, and the imprisonment of students in all countries struggling for their independence and freedom, considering this to be an arbitrary measure that hinders the normal conduct of education in those countries and is bound to change the way of life in those countries; in particular, expresses condemnation for the tragic situations in Algeria and Cyprus; and extends warm respect to the people of these two countries who are fighting for their independence and freedom.

XX. Recommends that more emphasis should be placed on auditory and visual education—such as films, pictures, radio, etc.—in order to eliminate illiteracy in Asia and Africa.

XXI. Recommends that cooperation should be carried out to jointly produce films showing the developing situations in Asian and African countries in all aspects, such as themes related to mothers and children in Asian and African countries.
