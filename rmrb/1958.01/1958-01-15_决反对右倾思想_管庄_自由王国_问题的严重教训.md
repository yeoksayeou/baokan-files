    Resolutely Oppose Rightist Ideology
    The Severe Lessons of the "Independent Kingdom" of Guanzhuang

    After the exposure of the "independent kingdom" of Guanzhuang in the newspapers, many people were shocked. People couldn't understand why such a chaotic situation could occur in a unit of a central state organ near the capital. Why did this chaotic situation persist for so long without being corrected? This question deserves serious reflection. It must be admitted that the emergence of the "independent kingdom" of Guanzhuang is not an isolated phenomenon, but exposes serious problems in the leadership work of some of our state organs. There are many reasons for the creation of the "independent kingdom" of Guanzhuang, but the most important reason is rightist ideology in leadership. The most important manifestation of rightist ideology in the Guanzhuang issue is the tendency to separate from politics. This tendency is also relatively prominent in many other economic organs and factories and mines, and similar problems exist in some other state organs. Therefore, not only the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, but all state organs and factories and mines should learn from the Guanzhuang issue.

    One of the serious lessons of the Guanzhuang issue is that ideological and political work cannot be ignored in the work of any department. One of the serious errors of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry in the Guanzhuang issue was the relaxation of ideological and political work. They only grasped business leadership and did not grasp ideological and political leadership; they only cared about the completion of business work and did not care about the progress of ideological and political work. As a result, the tendency to simply value technology and completely disregard politics was seriously developed in these units. This is the ideological source of the spread of bourgeois ideology in Guanzhuang and the ideological source of the formation of the "independent kingdom" of Guanzhuang.

    The tendency to neglect ideological and political work is a very dangerous tendency. Because ideological and political work is the lifeline of our Party's work and the lifeline of the work of state organs. Why? First of all, we believe that socialist ideology cannot spontaneously arise among the masses. Lenin said that the workers' movement itself cannot spontaneously produce communism, but can only produce trade unionism. Only the combination of Marxist theory and the workers' movement can produce communism. This is even more true for other classes. Therefore, the view that as long as the private ownership of the means of production is changed, people's socialist ideas will naturally arise is completely wrong. Without ideological and political work, it is impossible for us to establish socialist ideas among state cadres. Secondly, we believe that the main feature of the transition period is the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and this struggle is largely manifested as the struggle between socialist ideology and capitalist ideology. Any region or department will be occupied by capitalist ideology if socialist ideology does not occupy the position. There will be no vacuum. The emergence and development of the "independent kingdom" of Guanzhuang is a vivid proof. If we want socialist ideology to occupy the position, we must carry out ideological and political work, promote socialist ideology, and criticize capitalist ideology. Finally, we believe that socialist construction is a cause for millions of people to carry out creative activities. After the Party and the state formulate guidelines, policies, and tasks, the most important thing is to mobilize the masses to implement and complete them, which is to constantly enlighten and improve the masses' consciousness of participating in socialist construction. To enlighten and improve this consciousness, we must carry out ideological and political work. It can be seen that ideological and political work is by no means an insignificant or dispensable thing, but is an inseparable part of the Party's leadership in all work. Politics and business are a unity of opposites. There must be both politics and business, and neither can be neglected. But politics is the commander, politics is the soul, and politics is the guarantee of the socialist direction of business. Abandoning and neglecting ideological and political work is essentially abandoning and neglecting the Party's leadership, abandoning and neglecting the Party's mass viewpoint and mass line, and is a serious manifestation of rightist tendencies.

    The leaders of any of our state organs should be business leaders and also become political leaders. There can be no socialism without socialist politics. And political sensitivity is an essential quality for every political leader. What is political sensitivity? It is being good at observing and analyzing problems from a political perspective, being good at seeing the essence from phenomena, being good at seeing big problems from small problems, and being good at foreseeing the development of things. However, some leading cadres in our current leading organs, although they are Communist Party members, have a non-political tendency and lack political sensitivity. In their eyes, phenomena are only phenomena, and small problems are only small problems. Even some obviously political problems are considered irrelevant. The leadership of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry is like this. The leadership of this ministry was not completely aware of the serious chaotic situation in Guanzhuang, such as the serious impurity of staff politically and ideologically, and the serious violations of law and discipline by thieves, hooligans, and gangsters, etc. However, the leadership of this ministry was calm and indifferent to these relatively serious political situations. This is another root cause for the long-term existence of the "independent kingdom" of Guanzhuang.

    Due to this serious rightist tendency in politics, the leadership of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry did not notice that there were also sharp contradictions between the enemy and ourselves in Guanzhuang. Therefore, no resolute and effective measures were taken against the bad elements who disturbed the social order in Guanzhuang. This is actually giving up the implementation of dictatorship over these bad elements. This rightist ideology is not only reflected in the Guanzhuang issue, but also in the work of many state organs, especially some political and legal departments. After the basic elimination of counter-revolutionaries, the weapon of people's democratic dictatorship, in addition to continuing to deal with those still existing but few counter-revolutionaries, must often be aimed at those thieves, embezzlers, rapists, swindlers and other bad elements. It should be pointed out that the contradiction between these bad elements and the working people is the contradiction between the enemy and ourselves. The idea that the contradiction between bad elements and the working people is a contradiction among the people, and the attempt to resolve this contradiction by means of unity-criticism-unity is a very confused and absurd idea. Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" on how to distinguish between contradictions among the people and contradictions between the enemy and ourselves: "At the present stage, in the period of building socialism, all classes, strata, and social groups that approve, support, and participate in the cause of socialist construction belong to the people; all social forces and social groups that resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to and sabotage socialist construction are enemies of the people." Those bad elements who can only play a destructive role in socialist construction obviously cannot belong to the scope of the people, but can only belong to the scope of the enemy. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong said in the same article: "In order to maintain social order and the interests of the broad masses of the people, it is also necessary to exercise dictatorship over those thieves, swindlers, arsonists, hooligan gangs, and various bad elements who seriously disrupt social order." It is necessary to give full play to the power of dictatorship over bad elements. Without this power, it will not be possible to subdue bad elements, nor can good people be protected.

    Similarly, due to political rightist tendencies and conservatism, the Ministry of Building Materials Industry lacked the necessary revolutionary spirit in handling some problems in Guanzhuang. The leadership of this ministry did not completely ignore the problems in Guanzhuang, and some problems were also tried to be solved. For example, the problem of departmentalism among the various units in Guanzhuang, where each unit acted on its own and did not cooperate with each other, the leadership of this ministry had tried to solve it, but not by revolutionary means, but by reformist means. If it could not be solved, it would be abandoned, so that the departmentalism of the various units in Guanzhuang not only was not overcome, but even intensified. This phenomenon of lacking revolutionary spirit in solving problems is quite common in many aspects of our country's work, and many situations exposed in this rectification movement are powerful evidence.

    We are revolutionaries. Our task is to overthrow the old and establish the new. And the facts prove that the old will not easily withdraw from the stage of history, and the new will not grow and consolidate without difficulties. This requires us to have a thorough and tenacious revolutionary spirit and carry out an irreconcilable and uncompromising struggle with the old. Problems are constantly occurring in our work, and our task is to constantly discover problems and solve them in a timely manner. Problems must be solved, and problems must be solved thoroughly. If it cannot be solved today, we must continue to find ways to solve it tomorrow; if this method cannot solve it, we must find a better way to solve it. Retreating in the face of difficulties and giving up halfway is not the attitude that revolutionaries should have.

    Why do rightist errors often occur in our work? This is because people's thinking often lags behind reality. This is a common phenomenon and the main root of rightist ideology. The main manifestation of rightist ideology is the underestimation of the development of the objective situation and the underestimation of subjective initiative, that is, people's subjective understanding does not meet the requirements of the development of objective things. At the same time, in our current society, bourgeois ideology and petty-bourgeois ideology still exist universally in people's minds, and even Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres also have this ideology and are constantly influenced by this ideology. And bourgeois ideology and petty-bourgeois ideology often manifest as rightist tendencies during the socialist revolution period.

    Therefore, opposing rightist ideology is a regular task in the work of our Party and country. Especially at present, when the people of our country are carrying out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and after the possibility of a great leap forward has appeared in the socialist cause throughout the country, rightist ideology has become the main danger. We must resolutely and thoroughly oppose this rightist ideology so that our socialist cause can achieve greater victories on all fronts. This is the most important lesson the "independent kingdom" of Guanzhuang issue has taught us.

### 决反对右倾思想  管庄“自由王国”问题的严重教训

    坚决反对右倾思想
    管庄“自由王国”问题的严重教训
    管庄“自由王国”在报纸上揭露以后，好多人大吃一惊。人们不了解，为什么中央国家机关在首都附近的单位中竟然会有这种混乱状态？为什么这种混乱状态又会长期存在而得不到纠正？这个问题的确值得人们深思猛省。应该承认，管庄“自由王国”的出现，决不是一种偶然的现象，而是暴露了在我们某些国家机关的领导工作中存在着严重的问题。造成管庄“自由王国”的原因当然很多，但是，最主要的原因是领导上的右倾思想。管庄问题上的右倾思想的最主要的表现就是脱离政治的倾向。这种倾向在其他很多经济机关中和厂矿企业中也是比较突出的，而且，在其他一些国家机关中也存在着类似的问题。因此不仅是建筑材料工业部，一切国家机关和厂矿企业都应该从管庄问题中吸取教训。
    管庄问题的严重教训之一是任何部门的工作中都不能忽视思想政治工作。建筑材料工业部在管庄问题上的严重错误之一就是放松了思想政治工作，他们只抓业务领导，不抓思想政治领导；只关心业务工作的完成情况，不关心思想政治工作的进行情况。结果上行下效，在这些单位中就严重地发展了单纯重视技术、完全轻视政治的倾向，这是资产阶级思想在管庄泛滥的思想根源，也是管庄形成“自由王国”的思想根源。
    忽视思想政治工作的倾向，是一种非常危险的倾向。因为思想政治工作是我们党的工作的生命线，也是国家机关工作的生命线。为什么？首先，我们认为，在群众中不可能自发地产生社会主义思想。列宁说过，工人运动本身不能自发地产生共产主义，只能产生工联主义，只有马克思主义理论和工人运动结合起来才能产生共产主义。工人阶级尚且如此，更不要说其他阶级了。因此那种认为只要生产资料私有制改变了，人们的社会主义思想也就会自然地产生的观点是完全错误的。没有思想政治工作，我们就不可能在国家干部中树立社会主义的思想。其次，我们认为，过渡时期的主要特征是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，这种斗争最大量地表现为社会主义思想和资本主义思想的斗争。任何地区、任何部门只要社会主义思想不去占领阵地，资本主义思想一定会去占领阵地，真空地带是不会有的。管庄“自由王国”的产生和发展就是活生生的证明。而我们要让社会主义思想占领阵地，就要进行思想政治工作，宣传社会主义思想，批判资本主义思想。最后，我们认为，社会主义建设事业是千百万群众进行创造性活动的事业，在党和国家制定方针、政策、任务之后，最重要的就是发动群众去贯彻、完成，就是要不断启发和提高群众参加社会主义建设的自觉。而要启发和提高群众这种自觉，就必须进行思想政治工作。可见，思想政治工作绝不是无足轻重的和可有可无的东西，而是在一切工作中体现党的领导的不可以须臾分离的东西。政治和业务是矛盾的统一体。既要有政治，又要有业务，二者不可偏废。但是政治是统帅，政治是灵魂，政治是业务的社会主义方向的保证。放弃和忽视思想政治工作，实质上就是放弃和忽视党的领导，放弃和忽视党的群众观点和群众路线，是严重的右倾表现。
    我们任何国家机关的领导人是业务领导者同时也应该成为政治领导者，没有社会主义政治就不会有社会主义。而政治敏感则是每一个政治领导者必备的品质。什么是政治敏感？就是善于从政治上观察和分析问题，善于从现象看本质，善于从小问题看大问题，善于预见事物的发展。而我们现在有些领导机关的领导干部，他们虽然身为共产党员，但是却存在着一种非政治倾向，缺乏政治敏感，现象在他们看来仅仅是现象，小问题在他们看来也仅仅是小问题，甚至一些明明是政治性的问题，在他们看来也无所谓。建筑材料工业部的领导上就是这样。管庄存在的严重混乱情况，比如工作人员政治上和思想上严重不纯的情况，以及盗窃犯、流氓、阿飞等坏分子严重违法乱纪的情况等等，这个部的领导上虽然并不完全了解，也不是完全不了解。但这个部的领导上对这些比较严重的政治性的情况，泰然处之，若无其事，这是管庄“自由王国”得以长期存在的另一根源。
    由于政治上这种严重的右倾，就使得建筑材料工业部的领导上没有注意到在管庄也有尖锐的敌我矛盾，因此也就没有对扰乱管庄社会治安的坏分子采取坚决有力的措施。这实际上是放弃了对这些坏分子实行专政。这种右倾思想不仅表现在管庄问题上，也表现在许多国家机关特别是一些政法部门的工作中。在反革命分子基本肃清以后，人民民主专政这一武器除了必须继续对付那些仍然存在但为数不多的反革命分子以外，必须经常地对准那些盗窃犯、贪污犯、强奸犯、诈骗犯等等坏分子。应该指出，这些坏分子和劳动人民之间的矛盾是敌我矛盾。那种认为坏分子和劳动人民之间的矛盾是人民内部矛盾，也企图用团结——批评——团结的方式去解决这种矛盾的想法是一种非常糊涂和荒谬的想法。毛泽东同志在关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题一文中对如何区分人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾的问题曾经明确地指出：“在现阶段，在建设社会主义的时期，一切赞成、拥护和参加社会主义建设事业的阶级、阶层和社会集团，都属于人民的范围；一切反抗社会主义革命和敌视、破坏社会主义建设的社会势力和社会集团，都是人民的敌人。”那些对社会主义建设只能起破坏作用的坏分子显然不能属于人民的范围，只能属于敌人的范围。因此毛泽东同志在同一文章中说：“为了维护社会秩序和广大人民的利益，对于那些盗窃犯、诈骗犯、杀人放火犯、流氓集团和各种严重破坏社会秩序的坏分子，也必须实行专政。”对坏分子一定要发挥专政的威力，没有这种威力，是不能使坏分子慑服，也不能使好人得到保护的。
    同样的，也由于政治上的右倾和保守，建筑材料工业部在处理管庄的一些问题上也就缺乏应有的革命精神。这个部的领导上对管庄的问题并非完全置之不理，有些问题也试图解决过，比如管庄各个单位之间各自为政、互不协作的本位主义问题，这个部的领导上就曾经试图解决过，但采取的不是革命的办法，而是改良的办法，解决不了，也就作罢，以致管庄各个单位的本位主义不但没有得到克服，甚至变本加厉起来。而这种在解决问题时缺乏革命精神的现象在我们国家的许多方面的工作中是相当普遍的，这次整风运动中暴露出来的很多情况就是有力的证明。
    我们是革命派。我们的任务是推翻旧的东西，建立新的东西。而事实证明，旧的东西不会轻易地退出历史舞台，新的东西也不是没有困难就可以成长和巩固起来的。这就要我们有一种彻底的顽强的革命精神，同旧的东西进行不调和、不妥协的斗争。在我们工作中问题是不断发生的，不断的发现问题和及时地解决问题就是我们的任务。有问题一定要解决，解决问题一定要力求彻底。今天解决不了，明天要继续想办法解决；这种办法解决不了，还要想出更好的办法来解决。遇难而退和半途而废，不是革命者应有的态度。
    为什么在我们工作中常常会出现右倾错误呢？这是因为人们的思想常常落后于实际，这是一种普遍现象，也是右倾思想的主要根源。右倾思想的主要表现就是对客观形势的发展估计不足，对主观的能动性估计不足，也就是人们的主观认识不符合于客观事物发展的要求。同时，在我们目前的社会中，资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想还在人们的头脑中普遍地存在着，就是共产党员和革命干部也存在着这种思想和时时刻刻受着这种思想的影响。而资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想在社会主义革命时期又经常表现为右倾。
    因此，反对右倾思想是我们党和国家工作中的经常任务。尤其是在目前，当我国人民正在进行政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的时候，当社会主义事业在全国范围内出现了大跃进的可能性以后，右倾思想更成了主要的危险。必须坚决彻底地反掉这种右倾思想，使我们的社会主义事业在各个战线上获得更大的胜利。这是管庄“自由王国”问题给我们的最重要的教训。
