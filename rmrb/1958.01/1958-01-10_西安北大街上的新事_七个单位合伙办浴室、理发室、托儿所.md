Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 8th: Seven units located on North Main Street in Xi'an, including the Northwest Architectural Engineering Management Bureau and the Northwest Surveying Branch, accepted employee suggestions during the rectification campaign and are gradually converting their previously decentralized employee welfare programs into unified management.

These units have already combined two nurseries and merged the bathhouse and hot water stove, saving three childcare workers, three water heaters, and five rooms. Equipment that was originally planned for purchase is no longer needed, and five tons of coal are saved each month. After merging the barber shop, barbers are no longer unevenly busy or idle, and a lot of water and electricity are saved. They have also drafted a plan for the joint operation of clinics, canteens, and clubs. According to this plan, after the clinic and catering are jointly operated, the potential of equipment and people can be brought into play, reducing four medical personnel and nine administrators and cooks. The four stoves eliminated can save more than three tons of coal per month. They also plan to uniformly use sports and recreational equipment and use the vacated large canteen as a club, which saves money and does more.

In the past, the employee welfare programs of these seven units were all operated independently, resulting in significant waste. For example, the three clinics, which were no more than 300 steps apart, had a total of thirteen medical personnel and three auxiliary personnel, each with its own set of medical supplies and equipment. The three clinics were unevenly busy or idle, and poorly managed, resulting in a monthly overspending of 150 to 300 yuan.

After employees criticized and made suggestions about the decentralized management of welfare programs during the rectification campaign, the leaders of these seven units jointly established a unified employee life welfare committee, with an office responsible for specific work.

    西安北大街上的新事
    七个单位合伙办浴室、理发室、托儿所
    据新华社西安8日电　都设在西安北大街的西北建筑工程管理总局、西北勘察分院等七个单位，整改中接受职工建议，把原来分散经管的职工福利事业逐步改为统一经管。
    这些单位已经把两个托儿所合办，又把浴室和开水灶合并，省出了三个保育员、三个烧水工人和五间房子。原来准备添购的用具不必再买，每月还节省五吨煤。合办了理发室以后，理发员不再忙闲不均，还节约不少水电。他们又拟出医务所、食堂、俱乐部等的合办的方案。根据这个方案，医务所、伙食合办后，可以发挥设备和人的潜力，减去四个医疗人员，九个管理员、炊事员。减去的四个灶每月能省煤三吨多。他们还准备统一使用体育、文娱用品，用腾出的大食堂作俱乐部，既少花钱，又多办事。
    过去，这七个单位的职工福利事业都是各干各的，浪费很大。如三个医务所，相距不过三百步远，共有十三名医务人员和三个辅助人员，医疗药品和器材各搞一套。三个医务所忙闲不均，管理不好，每月都要超支一百五十元到三百元。
    整改中职工对分散经营福利事业的办法提出批评和建议后，这七个单位领导上便联合成立了统一合办职工生活福利委员会，下设办公室负责具体工作。
