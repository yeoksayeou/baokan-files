Your Excellency Ambassador, Gentlemen:

    I am very pleased to visit the Egyptian Embassy and to see here the noble symbol of the friendly affection between the peoples of two ancient nations, and indeed between the peoples of Asia and Africa.

    When the perfidious aggressor groups attacked Egypt, the esteemed masses of the people of this country gathered in front of this embassy to volunteer to defend Egypt in the struggle. In this very building, tens of thousands of letters from our Chinese brothers were opened, letters overflowing with sympathy for the cause of the Arab world and support for our struggle for freedom and peace.

    Today, I visit Egypt on Chinese soil, and I feel that the relationship between the allies of the Eastern peoples in the struggle for good and truth is one of great solidarity. I also feel that Egypt and China made great efforts at the Bandung Conference to strengthen the unity between the peoples of the participating countries and to reach unanimous resolutions. Egypt and China cooperated in adopting these resolutions and striving to implement them.

    Today, your embassy is welcoming some friends returning from the Cairo Conference. This conference is a link in the series of efforts we made in the Bandung Conference, and we should continue to organize and guide these efforts in order to achieve complete victory in the struggle against imperialism, in the struggle against the enemies of freedom and peace.

    We gratefully thank His Excellency the Egyptian Ambassador for his hospitality and friendly welcome, and from here we pay tribute to dear Egypt, to the President of Egypt—the great fighter, to the Chinese people, and to all the fighters on the two fighting continents.

    I pray to God to grant us success in strengthening the unity of the peoples of countries in struggle, to grant us happiness, and to allow us to cooperate in promoting truth, realizing freedom, and promoting comprehensive peace.

    I am happy to toast the health of President Gamal Abdel Nasser and Chairman Mao Zedong,

    To the health of His Excellency Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of China,

    To the health of His Excellency the Egyptian Ambassador and all the guests present,

    To the peoples of Asian and African countries who are determined to promote mutual friendship, solidarity, and strive for liberation,

    To the peoples of all countries who are determined to promote peace! (Attached picture)

    巴德尔王太子的讲话
    大使阁下，先生们：
    我很高兴能访问埃及大使馆并在这里看到两个古老国家的人民之间的甚至是亚非两洲人民之间的友好亲爱的崇高标志。
    当背信弃义的侵略集团进攻埃及的时候，这个国家的尊贵的人民群众曾经汇集在这个使馆前面要求志愿保卫斗争中的埃及，就在这座大楼里拆开了来自中国兄弟们的成千上万的信件，这些信件里洋溢着对阿拉伯世界事业的同情和对我们为了争取自由与和平所进行的斗争的支持。
    今天我在中国的土地上访问埃及，我感到东方人民为争取美好和真理而斗争的同盟者之间的关系是一种伟大的团结关系，我也感到埃及和中国在万隆会议中为了加强与会的各国人民之间的团结，为了取得一致的决议所作出的巨大的努力；埃及和中国在通过这些决议和努力执行这些决议方面进行了合作。
    今天贵使馆在迎接由开罗会议归来的一些朋友，这个会议是继续我们在万隆会议中所作的一系列努力的一个环节，我们应该继续去组织和指导这些努力，以便在反对帝国主义的斗争里，在对自由、和平的敌人进行的斗争里获得全胜。
    我们愉快的感谢埃及大使阁下给予我们的款待和友好的欢迎，并且从这里向亲爱的埃及，向埃及总统——伟大的斗士，向中国人民，向斗争中的两大洲所有的斗士致敬。
    我求祈真主使我们在加强斗争中的各国人民的团结方面获得成功，赐给我们幸福，让我们在发扬真理实现自由促进全面的和平方面进行合作。
    我高兴地为加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔总统和毛泽东主席的健康干杯，
    为中国国务院总理周恩来阁下的健康干杯，
    为埃及大使阁下和所有到会的来宾们健康干杯，
    为坚决促进相互的友谊团结和争取解放的亚非各国人民干杯，
    为坚决促进和平的各国人民干杯！（附图片）
