Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th - TASS reported from Moscow on the 12th: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, has written to the Prime Minister of Norway, Gerhardsen, the Prime Minister of Canada, Diefenbaker, and the Prime Minister of Greece, Karamanlis.

These letters have been delivered by the Soviet Ambassadors to Norway, Canada, and Greece respectively. Enclosed with the letters were the "Proposals of the Soviet Government on the Issue of Easing International Tension."

In his letter to Gerhardsen, Bulganin noted with satisfaction that Gerhardsen and his government, like the leaders of some Western countries, had taken a positive attitude towards the Soviet government's proposal for a meeting of national leaders to discuss pressing international issues in its previous letters. The letter stated that we are also satisfied to know that you and the Prime Minister of Denmark, Mr. Hansen, have made statements respectively regarding Norway and Denmark's refusal to deploy nuclear weapons and intermediate-range rocket launchers on their territory. Bulganin welcomed this decision by Norway and Denmark, considering it a contribution to the entire cause of peace, and especially to easing the situation in Europe.

Bulganin then pointed out that the positive remarks of individual participants in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting were largely undermined by the decisions of the meeting, such as the decision to place ballistic missiles at the disposal of the Supreme Command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to establish nuclear warhead reserves, atomic bases, and rocket weapon launch sites on the territory of Western European countries. The letter stated that if we take into account that Norway also agreed to this decision, and had decided earlier to arm the Norwegian army with certain types of American rocket weapons, then we must conclude that far from everything has been done to turn Northern Europe into a true area of peace and tranquility.

Bulganin believes that holding a meeting of the leaders of some countries in the next two or three months to study the most urgent and ripe international issues is in line with the goal of easing international tension and establishing a genuine atmosphere of trust among countries.

In his letter, Bulganin mentioned that the unease of the Norwegian public regarding the "brinkmanship" policy pursued by Western countries is growing, and they advocate ending the "Cold War" and resolving international disputes through negotiations. The letter also expressed satisfaction with the remarks of Norwegian parliamentarian Finn Moe in favor of negotiations, as well as Gerhardsen's own attitude in advocating East-West negotiations and studying both sides' proposals aimed at easing international tension.

Bulganin hopes that the Norwegian government will carefully study the Soviet proposal for convening a high-level meeting and use its influence to facilitate the convening of the meeting.

In his letter to Diefenbaker, Bulganin pointed out that the Soviet government was pleased to hear his statements at the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council and in the Canadian Parliament regarding the need to negotiate with the Soviet Union on disarmament and other outstanding international issues. The Soviet government was also pleased to hear that Canada is increasingly frequently calling for the peaceful settlement of international problems through East-West negotiations.

The letter stated that, considering the urgent need to take emergency measures to halt the arms race, the Soviet government believes that holding a high-level meeting of leaders with the participation of heads of government would be the most fundamental step.

Bulganin pointed out that Moscow has noted the news that the Canadian government is willing to facilitate negotiations between East-West leaders on disarmament and other international issues. The Soviet government will undoubtedly welcome the Canadian government's efforts in this regard and hopes that the Canadian government will give due consideration to the Soviet government's proposals and opinions in the letter.

In his letter to Karamanlis, Bulganin pointed out that the people of the world hate and oppose war, and the recently concluded Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was a vivid manifestation of this. Bulganin then wrote: Mr. Prime Minister, you must be more aware than anyone else that this desire for peace is deeply rooted in the hearts of the Greek people. You are clearly aware of the many statements made by representatives of all strata of Greek residents, all of which talk about the need to take urgent measures to ban nuclear weapons and hold international negotiations so as to forever free their country and its material and cultural wealth from the threat of destruction.

The letter stated that the Soviet government believes that a meeting of the leaders of the member states of the North Atlantic Alliance and the member states of the Warsaw Treaty Organization, as well as some countries that are not members of the above two groups, should be convened in the next two or three months.

Bulganin hopes that the Greek government will seriously study the Soviet government's proposals and take a positive attitude towards these proposals.

    布尔加宁写信给挪、加、希三国政府首脑
    希望注意苏联建议促成高级会议
    赞扬挪威和丹麦拒绝在本国设置核武器和火箭
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科12日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁写信给挪威首相基哈德森、加拿大总理迪芬贝克和希腊首相卡拉曼利斯。
    这些信件已经由苏联驻挪威、加拿大和希腊大使分别递交。信中并附有“苏联政府关于缓和国际紧张局势问题的建议”。
    布尔加宁在给基哈德森的信中满意地指出，基哈德森和他的政府，同一些西方国家政府领导人一样，对苏联政府上次信件中所提出的各国领导人会晤讨论迫切的国际问题的主张采取了积极的态度。信中说，我们还满意地知道，您和丹麦政府首脑汉森先生分别就挪威和丹麦拒绝在本国领土上设置核武器和发射中程火箭装置一事发表了声明。布尔加宁欢迎挪威和丹麦这种决定，认为这是对整个和平事业、特别是对缓和欧洲局势的贡献。
    布尔加宁接着指出，北大西洋公约组织会议个别参加者的积极言论在很大程度上被会议的这样一些决定削弱了，如关于让北大西洋公约组织最高统帅部支配弹道导弹和在西欧国家领土上建立核弹头储备、原子基地和火箭武器发射场的决定。信中说，如果考虑到挪威也赞同这个决定，并且早在这以前就决定用美国的某些种类的火箭武器武装挪威军队，那末就必须得出结论说，远非所有的事情都是为了把北欧变成真正的和平和安宁地区。
    布尔加宁认为，在最近两三个月内举行一些国家领导人的会议来研究最迫切和成熟了的国际问题，是符合于缓和国际紧张局势和建立各国间真正信任气氛的目的的。
    布尔加宁在信中提到，挪威公众对于西方国家实行的“战争边缘”政策的不安正在增长，他们主张结束“冷战”和通过谈判来解决国际争端。信中并对挪威议员芬·穆赞成谈判的言论以及基哈德森自己主张东西方谈判和研究双方旨在缓和国际紧张局势的建议的态度表示满意。
    布尔加宁希望挪威政府仔细研究苏联关于召开高级会议的建议并且利用自己的影响来促成会议的召开。
    布尔加宁在给迪芬贝克的信中指出，苏联政府满意地听到他在北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议上和在加拿大议会上所作的关于必须就裁军和其他悬而未决的国际问题同苏联进行谈判的发言。苏联政府还满意地听到，加拿大越来越经常地发出呼吁，要求通过东西方谈判来和平解决国际问题。
    信中说，考虑到迫切需要采取制止军备竞赛的紧急措施，苏联政府认为，举行有各国政府首脑参加的领导人高级会议将是最根本的步骤。
    布尔加宁指出，莫斯科已经注意到加拿大政府愿意促成东西方国家领导人就裁军问题和其他国际问题举行谈判的消息，苏联政府无疑会欢迎加拿大政府在这方面的努力，并且希望加拿大政府对苏联政府的建议和信中的意见给以应有的注意。
    布尔加宁在给卡拉曼利斯的信中指出，世界人民仇视和反对战争，不久前闭幕的亚非人民团结大会就是这方面的鲜明表现。布尔加宁接着写道：首相阁下，您一定比任何人都更清楚，这种和平的愿望也深入到希腊人民的心中。您清楚地知道希腊居民各阶层代表人物所发表的许多声明，这些声明中都谈到必须采取紧急措施来禁止核武器和举行国际谈判，以便使自己的国家及其物质财富和文化财富永远地摆脱毁灭的威胁。
    信中说，苏联政府认为，在最近两三个月内应当召开北大西洋联盟成员国和华沙条约组织成员国以及一些不是上述两个集团的国家的领导人会议。
    布尔加宁希望希腊政府认真研究苏联政府的建议和对这些建议采取肯定态度。
