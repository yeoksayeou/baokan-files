    Six Months in the Countryside
    Zhang Guoliang, Worker at Tianjin Tractor Factory

    The factory sent me to the Shangqiu Special District of Henan to train coal gas engine operators. In six months, we held two training classes, training more than 300 coal gas engine operators.

    Coal gas engines have a wide range of uses in the countryside. One agricultural cooperative used a coal gas engine to drive two waterwheels, with an hourly water output of 100 tons; some coal gas engines can irrigate 100 mu of land day and night. An agricultural cooperative in Tongxu County used a coal gas engine to drive a steel mill, milling 2,400 jin of flour in twelve hours.

    In the countryside, I deeply felt that the farmers love coal gas engines very much. Coal gas engines are in short supply in Henan Province. Once at the Ningling County Water Conservancy Bureau, I saw five farmers sitting in the room waiting for the director. The bureau's accountant told me that in order to take care of the overall situation, each township could only buy one coal gas engine. But these farmers all wanted to buy two. A representative of a disaster-stricken cooperative wanted to buy three. The accountant couldn't explain it to them, and they insisted on talking to the director. Yucheng County was only allocated 20 coal gas engines this year, but according to the farmers' requests, at least 200 more are needed. Two townships even had disagreements over buying coal gas engines, which were only resolved after the county magistrate intervened.

    When I went to the villages to understand the use of coal gas engines, the farmers often asked me: "Comrade, can we buy one?" These situations powerfully illustrate the increase in purchasing power in the countryside after collectivization, and also illustrate the farmers' enthusiasm for fighting to increase grain production.

    The farmers regard coal gas engines as the workers' support for them, and they are very happy. When a coal gas engine is transported to the village and starts pumping water, it is often surrounded by people, and even farmers from other villages come to visit. When the coal gas engine pumps water, the visitors clap excitedly. Once, an eighty-three-year-old man watched the coal gas engine pumping water and told me about how he used to work for the landlord and be beaten and scolded. Finally, he said excitedly: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao's leadership, how could I have seen a machine pumping water from a well at my age!"

    In Zhecheng County, a cooperative bought a coal gas engine. One night, there was a heavy rain, and the cooperative's director was afraid that the coal gas engine would get wet, so he took his new cotton quilt to the field and covered the coal gas engine. The next day, he said to the coal gas engine operator: "This is the blood and sweat of the worker elder brothers, we must not be careless."

    In order to let the farmers see the performance of coal gas engines with their own eyes, coal gas engine operation demonstrations have been held in various parts of Henan. In Shangqiu Special District alone, more than 150 demonstrations have been held, with more than 500,000 farmers visiting.

    In the countryside for more than half a year, I made more than a thousand friends, and I had acquaintances almost everywhere I went. They pulled me to their homes for dinner, wrote me letters, and called me teacher. Although life in the countryside is a bit harder, I feel very warm. The farmers' enthusiasm has profoundly educated me and made me further realize the importance of the worker-peasant alliance. We should redouble our efforts to manufacture more coal gas engines to support our peasant brothers.

    在农村半年
    天津拖拉机制造厂工人　张国良
    厂里派我到河南商丘专区训练煤气机操作手。半年内，我们共开了两次训练班，训练了三百多名煤气机操作手。
    煤气机在农村里用途很广。有一个农业社用一台煤气机带动两个水车，每小时出水量达一百吨；有的煤气机日夜可以浇地一百亩。通许县一个农业社用一台煤气机带动钢磨，十二小时磨出面粉二千四百斤。
    在农村里，我深深感到农民非常热爱煤气机。煤气机在河南省供不应求。有一次在宁陵县水利局，我看到有五个农民坐在屋里等局长。局里的会计告诉我，他们为了照顾全面，每个乡只能买一部煤气机。但是这几个农民，都要买两部。有一个受灾的合作社的代表，要买三部。会计员向他们解释不通，他们一定要和局长面谈。虞城县今年只分配了二十部煤气机，但根据农民的要求，起码得二百多部。有两个乡为了争买煤气机，还闹了意见，最后县长出来调解才解决了。
    我到村里去了解煤气机使用的情况时，农民常常向我要求：“同志，我们买一部行吗？”这些情况有力地说明了合作化以后农村购买力的提高，也说明了农民们为增产粮食而斗争的积极性。
    农民们把煤气机看做是工人对他们的支援，非常高兴。一部煤气机运到村里开始抽水的时候，常常是被人们包围起来，甚至外村的农民也赶来参观。当煤气机抽出水来以后，参观的人便兴奋地鼓掌。有一次，一位八十三岁的老大爷看了煤气机抽水的表演后，对我讲起他当年给地主扛活受打骂的情况，最后他兴奋地说：“要不是毛主席领导，我这么大年纪，怎能看得见井上用机器抽水！”
    在柘城县有一个合作社买了一台煤气机，有一天夜里下暴雨，合作社社长怕煤气机被淋，便抱着自己的新棉被跑到地里，把煤气机盖起来。第二天他对煤气机操作手说：“这是工人老大哥的血汗啊，可不能粗心大意。”
    为了使农民们亲眼看到煤气机的性能，河南各地都举办了煤气机的操作表演，仅商丘专区就举办了一百五十多次，参观的农民达五十多万人次。
    在农村半年多，我交了一千多个朋友，几乎走到哪里都有熟人。他们拉我到家里吃饭，给我写信，叫我老师。在农村生活虽然苦一些，但我感到非常温暖。农民的热情，深刻地教育了我，使我进一步认识到工农联盟的重要意义。我们应该加倍努力，多多制造煤气机，支援农民兄弟。
