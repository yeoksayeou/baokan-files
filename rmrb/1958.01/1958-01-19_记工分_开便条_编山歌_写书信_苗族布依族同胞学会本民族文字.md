    Miao and Bouyei Compatriots Learn Their Own National Languages
    (Our report) Significant progress has been made in the pilot programs for the Miao and Bouyei languages in Guizhou Province. Most students have not only mastered the phonetics and tones but can also apply the languages to their daily lives and production, such as recording work points, writing notes, composing folk songs, and writing letters.
    Xu Cailian, a Miao woman from Yanghao Village in Kaili, uses the Miao language to record work points. She happily said, "The language I learned is very useful. Recording work points is no longer like drawing lines and counting beans like it used to be." Long Anchang and Long Jixian, Miao farmers from Chounao Township in Songtao County, can not only write and record but also frequently communicate with Miao people in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan via Miao, sending each other folk songs, stories, and exchanging learning experiences. Tian Yuqing, a student from the same township, composed a folk song in the Miao language:
    “...Miao writing is like the moon rising over the mountains,
    Gradually illuminating the entire mountain range and the earth.
    From now on, the words of the Miao people can be written in books!
    Every word and phrase can be recorded in our own language."
    A total of fifty-eight Bouyei people from Dazhai, Huaxi, participated in the study. Ten of them can record folk songs, write letters, and record stories in the Bouyei language, twenty can keep accounts and record work points, and the others have basically mastered the phonetics and tones and learned the phonetic alphabet.
    From July of last year to now, the Provincial National Language Steering Committee has received two hundred and ninety-eight letters written by people of the Miao, Bouyei, Dong, Shui, and Yi ethnic groups. These letters are filled with gratitude to the Party and Chairman Mao. Many of them are written in the Miao and Bouyei languages. Xu Shibi (transliteration), a Miao farmer from Yanghao Village in Kaili, wrote to Chairman Mao in the Miao language: "Chairman Mao: I have never been to school before, but now I can write to you with my own hands. I really don't know how to thank you. We work during the day and study at night, and we are living a good life." Zhang Meizhen, a Miao woman from Shimenkan, Weining County, wrote to the Provincial National Language Steering Committee in the Miao language: "The Miao people had no writing, like blind people. The Party and the government really thought of everything and have now given us a pair of eyes, so that even a housewife like me who didn't know a single word in the past can write letters."

    记工分　开便条　编山歌　写书信
    苗族布依族同胞学会本民族文字
    本报讯　贵州省苗文、布依文各试点工作取得显著成绩，大部分学员不仅掌握了声韵调，而且能把文字运用到日常生活和生产中去，如记工分、写便条、编山歌和写信。
    凯里养薅村苗族妇女许才莲用苗文记工分，她高兴地说：“我学习的文字有了大用，记工分再也不像过去划道道、数豆子了。”松桃县臭脑乡苗族农民龙长安、龙继先等人不但能写能记，还经常和湖南湘西土家族苗族自治州的苗族人民用苗文互相通信寄一些山歌、故事，交流学习心得。该乡学员田玉清用苗文编了山歌：
    “……苗文像山头初升的月亮一样，
    逐渐地要照遍整个山岭和大地。
    今后苗家的话可以写在书本上啦！
    一言一语都可以用自己的文字记载。”
    花溪大寨参加学习的布依族共五十八人，能以布依文记山歌、写信和记故事的十人，能记账、记工分的二十人，其他也基本上掌握了声韵调和学会了拼音。
    从去年7月到现在，省民族语文指导委员会收到苗、布依、侗、水、彝等族人民写的二百九十八封信。这些信里充满了对党和毛主席的感激的心情。其中有不少是用苗文、布依文写的。凯里养薅村苗族农民许仕壁（译音）用苗文写给毛主席的信里说：“毛主席：我过去没有念过书，可是我现在能够亲手给您写信了。我真不知道怎样来感谢您。我们白天干活，晚上念书，我们的日子过得很好。”威宁县石门坎苗族妇女张美珍用苗文写给省民族语文指导委员会的信里说：“我们苗家没有文字，就像瞎子一样，党和政府硬是想的周到，现在给我们添了一双眼睛，连我这个过去一字不识的家庭妇女也能写信了。”
