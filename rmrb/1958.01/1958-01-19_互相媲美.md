    Competing with Each Other
    Ta Ge
    A grand and unprecedented wave of transferring cadres from national universities to lower levels is surging. Combining with workers and peasants and engaging in labor have become the common demands of intellectuals. This is an unprecedented event and a revolution in the thinking and style of intellectuals.
    In universities, this revolutionary spirit is being greatly promoted.
    On the one hand, there is a need to go down, to the countryside and mountains, to breathe with the working people, feel the beating of a common pulse, and learn a common language. In many schools' departments, the number of people requesting to be transferred has already achieved "all-round red" [a term for universal agreement or success], and it is not difficult to imagine that, in order to transform themselves into working-class intellectuals, who would not want to take the lead in training? Before being transferred, the cadres of Sichuan Agricultural College strived to do more work and do it better, making explanations on every matter. They did not relax their work because they were eager to be transferred. This is a revolutionary spirit, a socialist drive.
    Many people have gone down, and naturally, the teaching tasks in the schools must still be undertaken, and people must be found to replace them. On this front, those who remain in the schools need to carry forward the revolutionary spirit and muster revolutionary drive. This is precisely what the teachers and staff who remained at Sichuan Agricultural College did. They put forward the slogan of one person doing the work of two, bravely taking on the work of those who went down, and eagerly welcoming their own future transfer.
    Whether going to the countryside and mountains or staying at home, everyone has displayed socialist revolutionary drive to do a good job in teaching, competing with each other. This is an attitude of wholeheartedly serving the people and the starting point for the self-transformation of intellectuals today.
    May this spirit be fully promoted in universities across the country!

    互相媲美
    踏歌
    全国高等学校干部正掀起波澜壮阔的下放浪潮。同工农结合，同劳动结合已经成为知识分子的共同要求。这是一件史无前例的大事，是知识分子从思想到作风上的革命。
    在高等学校里，这种革命精神正在大为发扬。
    一方面，需要下去，下乡上山，同劳动人民共同呼吸，感受共同的脉搏的跳动，学会共同的语言。许多学校的系、科，要求下放的人已经“满堂红”，不难想像，为了把自己改造成为工人阶级知识分子，谁个不愿带头去锻炼呢？四川农学院的下放干部，在下放前争取多做工作，把工作做得更好，件件作交代，并不因为下放心切，而放松了工作。这是一种革命精神，一种社会主义干劲。
    许多人下去了，自然，学校中的教学任务还得负担起来，还得要有人来代替。这一方面，就需要留在学校里的人发扬革命精神，鼓起革命干劲来做。四川农学院留校的教师和职员，也正是这样做了。他们提出了一个人做两个人的事的口号，勇敢地把下去的人的工作分担下来，并且满怀热忱地迎接着将来自己的下放。
    无论是下乡上山去的，还是留在家里的，都拿出了社会主义的革命干劲，把教学工作做好，来互相媲美。这就是全心全意为人民服务的态度，也是当前知识分子自我改造的出发点。
    愿这种风气在全国高等学校里全面发扬！
