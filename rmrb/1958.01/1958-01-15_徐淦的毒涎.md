Xu Gan's Poisonous Saliva
陶风

During May and June of last year, rightist Xu Gan published several "Random Thoughts" in the supplement of the People's Daily. Using innuendo, he distorted facts and maliciously stirred up trouble between leading cadres and the masses. Every time we think of the poisonous saliva he spewed, we cannot suppress the anger in our hearts.

Xu Gan was once a traitorous writer during the Japanese puppet regime and a loyal pawn of the Kuomintang's "Peace Daily" (i.e., Saodang Daily). After liberation, the Party generously forgave his numerous historical crimes, gave him a suitable job, and has truly been benevolent and righteous to him for several years. However, his anti-people nature is hard to change. He stubbornly refused ideological reform and finally degenerated into a despicable rightist, once again launching an attack on the Party and the people.

Xu Gan particularly opposed the past ideological remolding movements. As soon as the blooming and contending began, in his "Random Thoughts" on May 10, he immediately appeared as a "petty man who had been beaten enough," comparing the leaders to "officials in the hall" and portraying himself as a wronged "commoner below the steps," openly calling the time before the rectification as an undemocratic era where "the words of superiors, right or wrong, were passed, and the words of inferiors, wrong, were punished." He believed the rightists' attack was an opportunity that needed to be countered, attempting to incite some intellectuals to attack the Party together. In a "Random Thought" on June 12, he sarcastically said: "Some institutions, every year make summaries, and every time there is a clause: to strengthen ideological work. One strengthening, two strengthening, some have already strengthened to such an extent that the Party and Youth League branches cannot shirk their responsibility; the trade union has an inescapable duty; the administrative heads below, the directors of departments, offices, and sections naturally manage it; the personnel section goes without saying; the heads and deputy heads of the business sections and groups actually also take this as their main task; all Party members and Youth League members who are not in leadership positions are also invariably doing this work." These words most clearly revealed his deep-seated hatred for the Party's ideological work and his ugly anti-Party face. Xu Gan hates the Party's ideological work so much because the Party's ideological work is exerting a huge force in changing the face of intellectuals, playing a huge role in defending the socialist cause, attacking bourgeois ideology, and eliminating the remnants of capitalism. This is one of the keys in the struggle between the two roads, and it is a guarantee of our victory. No matter how much the rightists hate it, we must still put the Party's ideological work in the first place. Xu Gan's attempt to open up a "free market" for bourgeois ideology will never be realized.

In order to stir up the relationship between the Party and the masses, in his "Random Thoughts" on May 30 last year, Xu Gan again put on a compassionate and pitying appearance, saying that the Communist Party treats the elderly, the sick, and the young as burdens that cannot be thrown away. This is a malicious slander, with the aim of provoking these people's dissatisfaction with the Communist Party. In fact, comparing the past with the present, when has there ever been such proper care for the elderly as there is now (I ask, what era had "five guarantees"); such assistance for the sick (when was there public medical care); such cultivation and care for the young? What era has seen so many young activists? And who is more attentive to promoting these than the Communist Party? Who else but those who are hostile to this society and the Communist Party would have the feeling of being an "unthrowable burden"?

However, Xu Gan wanted to further uglify the Communists as a sectarian group. In his "Random Thoughts" published on May 19 last year, he maliciously slandered our rectification as "closing the door to discipline the children," he suspected that "the parents inside the door would only listen to one side of the story, indulging in parental affection, and finish with a few painless and harmless scoldings," he worried that "the children" would still bully people when they came out of the door. Isn't this clearly scolding the Communist Party as evil children who take advantage of their power to bully others, and aren't the broad masses of non-Party members all being bullied by Communist Party members? From these words, we can see Xu Gan's hostile attitude toward the Party, his hostile attitude toward the great rectification movement, and it more fully exposes his conspiracy to fan the flames.

However, these vicious tricks were finally seen through by the people who love the Party and socialism. The hideous face that rightist Xu Gan had been covering with a painted mask was thus exposed. The poisonous saliva in his several "Random Thoughts" has, in turn, become ironclad proof of his anti-Party and anti-people face.

    徐淦的毒涎
    陶风
    去年5、6月间，右派分子徐淦在人民日报副刊上发表了几则“随感”，他以旁敲侧击的手法，歪曲事实，在领导干部与群众之间进行了恶意的挑拨。我们每一想到他喷射出的这毒涎，就抑止不住心头的愤怒。
    徐淦曾是日伪时期的汉奸文人，又是国民党“和平日报”（即扫荡报）的一个忠实走卒。解放以后，党宽大了他历史上的累累罪行，给他安置了适当工作，几年以来，对他确乎是仁至义尽了。然而，他反人民的本性难移，始终拒绝思想的改造，终于又堕落为可耻的右派分子，再一次发起了向党向人民的进攻。
    徐淦特别反对历次思想改造运动，鸣放刚一开始，他在5月10日的“随感，中马上以“挨打挨够了的小人”的姿态出现，把领导喻为“堂上的官吏”，把自己说成是负屈含冤的“阶下的百姓”，公然把整风以前叫作“大人话错话话过，小人话错打屁股”的不民主时代。他认为右派分子的进攻是一种机会，需要反一反了，妄图煽动某些知识分子，一道向党进攻。在6月12日的一篇“随感”中，他尖酸刻薄地说：“有些机关，年年做总结，回回有一条：要加强思想工作。一加强，二加强，有的已经加强到了这样的程度：党团支部，义不容辞；工会，责无旁贷；行政首长以下，部啊室啊处啊的主任当然也管；人事科不必说；业务科组的正副组长，居然也有以此为主的；所有不在领导岗位的党员团员，也无往而不作这一门工作。”这些话最清楚地道出了他对党的思想工作的刻骨憎恨和反党的丑恶面目。徐淦所以这样憎恶党的思想工作，是因为党的思想工作正在起着改变知识分子面貌的巨大力量，起着捍卫社会主义事业，打击资产阶级思想，消灭资本主义残余的巨大力量，这是两条道路斗争中的关键之一，是我们胜利的一种保证。不管右派分子如何憎恨，我们还是要把党的思想工作放在第一位。徐淦打算为资产阶级思想开拓“自由市场”的企图是永也不能实现的了。
    徐淦为了挑拨党群关系，在去年5月30日的“随感”中，便又摆出一副悲天悯人的神态，说共产党把老人、病人、青年人当作扔不掉的包袱。这是一种恶意的诽谤，目的不外乎挑起这些人对共产党不满。其实拿以往比今天，什么时候有过现在这样的对老人妥善的照顾（请问什么时代有过“五保”）；这样的对病人扶助（公费医疗何时有）；这样的对青年培养爱护，哪个时代出现过这样多的青年积极分子？又有什么人比共产党更加注意提倡这些。“扔不掉的包袱”的感受除了敌视这社会和共产党的人以外，谁会还能有？
    然而，徐淦还要进一步把共产党人丑化为宗派主义集团。他在去年5月19日发表的“随感”中，恶意诬蔑我们的整风是“关门训子”，他怀疑“家长在门内会不会听了一面之词，舐犊情深，不痛不痒地训了几句完事”，他担心“孩子”开门出来仍旧欺侮人。这不明明地把共产党骂作是仗势欺人的恶孩子，而广大的非党群众又都是受共产党员欺侮的吗？从这些话里，我们可以看出徐淦对党的敌视态度，对伟大的整风运动的敌视态度，而且更加充分地暴露了他扇风点火的阴谋。
    但是这些恶毒的伎俩，终于都被热爱党和社会主义的人民识破。右派分子徐淦一直用画皮掩盖着的狰狞面目，由此也被揭穿。他的几篇“随感”里的毒涎，反过来却成了他的反党反人民的面目的铁证。
