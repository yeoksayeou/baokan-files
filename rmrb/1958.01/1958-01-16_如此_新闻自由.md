Notes

    Such "Freedom of the Press"
    U.S. House Speaker Rayburn accused the U.S. government of "attempting to deceive the American people into thinking that the Russians were little better than savages" before the Soviet Union launched its satellite. Rayburn believed that this kind of policy of fooling the people by the U.S. government had made the United States lag far behind the Soviet Union in science and technology.
    The reason for the backwardness of the United States is certainly not just this point, but Rayburn's accusation unintentionally revealed the truth about the "freedom of the press" that the United States has always boasted about.

    如此“新闻自由”
    美国众议院议长雷明指责美国政府说，在苏联发射卫星以前，政府“企图欺骗美国老百姓，使他们认为俄国人比野蛮人好不了多少。”雷明认为美国政府的这种愚民政策，使美国在科学技术等方面远远落后于苏联。
    美国落后的原因当然不是这一点，但是，雷明的指责却无意中揭露了美国一向吹嘘的“新闻自由”的真相。
