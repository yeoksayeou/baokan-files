    Many People in Thailand Still Smoke Opium
    According to reports in Bangkok newspapers, Monglerd Chaowong Thanaphon, Director-General of the Thai Revenue Department, stated on the 16th that, according to a recent survey, there are approximately 80,000 to 100,000 opium smokers in Thailand. In 1957, Thailand sold a total of fourteen tons of opium, from which the Revenue Department received an income of 398 million baht.
    Monglerd Chaowong said that last year Thai authorities seized ten tons of smuggled opium, worth tens of millions of baht. He said that the Revenue Department has decided to build four large-scale smoking cessation hospitals across the country starting this year, to provide free accommodation for people who voluntarily want to quit smoking.
    According to newspaper reports, there are a total of 1,100 opium dens in Thailand, more than 100 of which are located in Bangkok and Thonburi.

    泰国还有许多人吸鸦片
    据曼谷报纸报道，泰国国税厅厅长蒙勒差翁·唐蓬16日发表谈话说，根据最近一次调查，泰国约有八万到十万个吸鸦片烟的人，1957年泰国售出的鸦片烟共计十四吨，国税厅从中得到三亿九千八百万铢的收入。
    蒙勒差翁说，去年泰国当局所缉获的走私鸦片烟有十吨，价值数千万铢。他说，国税厅已经决定从今年起在全国建设四所大规模的戒烟医院，免费收容自愿戒烟的人。
    据报纸报道，泰国共有一千一百多家鸦片烟馆，其中设在曼谷和吞武里的有一百多家。
