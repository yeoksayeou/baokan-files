    Two Noteworthy Situations

    The state's issuance of hard-currency fen coins has played a significant role in facilitating the public and meeting the needs of market transactions. However, some people still do not fully understand this measure of issuing hard-currency fen coins, resulting in two noteworthy situations. One is that some people hoard the hard-currency fen coins they get as change in the market, keeping five or ten of them as "collectibles" and "souvenirs" and are unwilling to put them back into the market. Some units even exchange for large quantities of coins and then redistribute them to employees to collect and play with. This defeats the purpose, meaning, and effect of issuing hard-currency fen coins. The state's issuance of hard-currency fen coins to replace paper fen coins is precisely to facilitate the public and meet the needs of market transactions. If each of the 600 million people in the country hoarded an average of one each of the one-fen, two-fen, and five-fen hard-currency coins, the market would be short 1.8 billion coins, worth 48 million yuan, equivalent to 500,000 taels of gold being tied up. This would inevitably seriously affect the turnover of subsidiary currency in the market, resulting in great losses for the state. Secondly, a small number of people, after the issuance of hard-currency fen coins, do not cherish the original paper fen coins enough, thinking that the paper fen coins will be replaced by hard-currency fen coins anyway, so they might as well be replaced sooner rather than later if they are damaged. Therefore, some damaged paper fen coins are not being repaired.

    I hope everyone will cherish both hard-currency and paper fen coins, neither deliberately hoarding them nor damaging them, so that they can fully play their role in the market.

    两种值得注意的情况
    国家发行硬分币，对便利群众、满足市场交易的需要起着很大作用。但也还有部分人对发行硬分币这一措施认识不够全面，而产生两种值得注意的情况。一是把市场上零找来的硬分币五个、十个的藏起当作“欣赏品”和“纪念品”而不愿再转到市场上去。有的单位甚至大批兑来硬币，再调换给职工分藏着玩。这样就失去发行硬分币的目的、意义和作用了。国家发行硬分币替换纸分币就是为了方便群众，满足市场交易的需要，如果全国六亿人每人平均都藏起一分二分与五分三种硬分币各一枚，市场上就要少去十八亿枚，价值四千八百万元，相当于五十万两黄金被积压，这就必然要严重影响市场辅币的周转，国家损失很大。其次，也有一少部分人在硬分币发行之后，对原有的纸分币爱惜不够，认为纸分币反正要被硬分币替换，早破早换。因此部分纸分币有了破损也没有人补了。
    我希望大家都来爱护硬分币和纸分币，既不故意储藏，更不要损坏它，让它在市场上充分发挥作用。
