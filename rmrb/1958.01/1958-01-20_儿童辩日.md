Children Argue About the Sun
    Yang Hui
    In the book "Liezi" of the Zhou Dynasty, there is such a story:
    Confucius was traveling east and saw two children arguing. He asked them why. One child said, "I think the sun is closer to people when it first comes out and farther away at midday." The other child said, "The sun is far away when it first comes out, and closer at midday." One child said, "The sun is as big as a carriage cover when it first comes out, but as small as a plate at midday. Doesn't this mean that things are smaller when they are far away and bigger when they are close?" The other child said, "The sun is cool when it first comes out, but as hot as boiling water at midday. Doesn't this mean that things are hotter when they are close and cooler when they are far away?" Confucius could not decide. The two children laughed and said, "Who said you were knowledgeable!"
    The question the two children were arguing about was the distance between the sun and the observer in the morning and at noon. Child A thought that objects appear larger when they are closer to people's eyes and smaller when they are farther away. Therefore, the sun is close to the observer when it first rises and far away at noon. Child B thought that hot objects are hotter when they are closer and cooler when they are farther away. Therefore, the sun is far away when it first rises and close at noon. They both judged the distance of the sun in the morning and at noon based on their one-sided daily experiences, and came to completely opposite conclusions. At that time, astronomical and physical knowledge was still very immature, so Confucius could not decide who was right and was ridiculed.
    When the sun first rises, it is nestled among mountains, rivers, trees, and houses, so it looks big. At noon, the sun is in the infinite sky, without any backdrop, so it looks small. In addition, the spherical space is often seen as flat, which creates the illusion of the sun's size. Therefore, it is not correct to judge the distance between the sun and the ground solely by people's eyes.
    The Earth's surface is surrounded by a layer of atmosphere. When the sun rises, the light rays pass through the atmosphere obliquely to reach the ground, while at noon, they pass through the atmosphere almost directly (Note). Oblique passage covers a longer distance through the atmosphere, and more heat is absorbed; direct passage covers a shorter distance through the atmosphere, and less heat is absorbed. Moreover, the illuminance per unit area on the ground is small when the light is oblique, so the heat is less; when the light is direct, the illuminance per unit area is large, so the heat is more. In addition, the ground's heat has not yet accumulated when the sun first comes out in the morning, and the heat has gradually disappeared at night. Only at noon is the heat stored the most, so it is hot at noon and cool in the morning and evening. It is also incorrect to judge distance solely by the cold or heat of the sun in people's perception.
    The Earth is constantly moving, turning over once a day, called a rotation. Now we assume that the Earth only rotates. Then, people living on the equator should be far away from the sun in the morning and close to the sun at noon. An example is easy to understand (see Figure A): If the rotation of a wheel is regarded as the Earth's rotation, the "×" on the tire is regarded as the observer on Earth, and the line under the wheel is regarded as the sun. When the wheel rotates, the "×" comes into contact with the straight line, which is considered noon, at which time the distance is the closest (Figure 1). After rotating ninety degrees, the distance between "×" and the straight line is the radius of the wheel, which is considered night (Figure 2). After rotating another ninety degrees, the distance between "×" and the straight line is the diameter of the wheel, which is considered midnight, at which time the distance is the farthest (Figure 3). After rotating another ninety degrees, the distance between "×" and the straight line is again the radius of the wheel, which is considered morning (Figure 4). Continuing to rotate another ninety degrees, "×" is in contact with the straight line again, thus completing a week. From here, we can know that it is close to the sun at noon, far from the sun in the morning and evening, and even farther at midnight.
    If "×" is marked on the axle (see Figure 1, 2, 3, 4), then regardless of whether the wheel rotates or not, its distance from the straight line is always the radius of the wheel. This is like the distance from the observer at the Earth's poles to the sun, which is exactly the same in the morning, evening, and noon.
    The higher the latitude of the observer's location, the smaller the difference between the distance to the sun at morning and noon. At the poles, there is no difference.
    We can also use a ball as an analogy: Let any point on the ball be considered the North Pole, and the point directly opposite it through the center of the ball be considered the South Pole. Draw a circular line between the North and South Poles and consider it the equator (see Figure B). Place the ball on the table so that the circular line touches the tabletop and rolls. In this way, no matter how many times the ball turns, the North and South Pole points always remain at the same distance from the straight line on the tabletop. Only a certain point on the equator, that is, a certain point on the circular line, sometimes touches the tabletop, sometimes is the radius of the ball away from the tabletop, and sometimes is the diameter of the ball away from the tabletop. The so-called higher latitude means farther from the equator, or closer to the poles. From this, it can be seen that when the ball is rolling, the higher the latitude, the smaller the difference in distance from the tabletop. At the poles, there is no difference.
    But in reality, it is not that simple, because the Earth has revolution in addition to rotation. This makes the distance to the sun not only related to the Earth's latitude but also related to various periods of the year.
    According to astronomers' calculations, when observing the distance to the sun in Beijing, from January 22 to June 5 every year, the sun is farther away at noon than at sunrise. It is one thousand kilometers farther in early February; four thousand kilometers farther in early March; and six thousand four hundred kilometers farther in early April. Afterwards, the difference gradually decreases until there is no difference. After June 5, the sun is closer at noon than at sunrise. It is five thousand eight hundred kilometers closer in early July; and sixteen thousand kilometers closer in mid-September. Afterwards, the difference gradually decreases again until after January 22 of the following year, when it repeats cyclically. This figure is applicable for the past one hundred years.
    [Note] This is the situation on the ground in our country. If it is on the equator, it is completely directly illuminated during the spring and autumn equinoxes. Guangzhou in our country is also almost all directly illuminated during the summer solstice. (Attached pictures)

    儿童辩日
    杨慧
    周朝“列子”一书中，有这样一个故事：
    孔子东游，见两小儿辩斗，问其故。一儿曰：“我以日始出时去人近，而日中时远也。”一儿曰：“日初出远，而日中时近也。”一儿曰：“日初出大如车盖；及日中则如盘盂，此不为远者小而近者大乎！”一儿曰：“日初出沧沧凉凉；及其日中如探汤，此不为近者热而远者凉乎！”孔子不能决也，两小儿笑曰：“孰谓汝多知乎！”
    两个小孩所争执的问题是早上和中午太阳距离观察者的远近。甲孩认为物体离开人们的眼睛，越近越大，越远越小，所以太阳是刚升起来的时候，离观察者近，中午就远了。乙孩认为发热的物体，越近越热，越远越凉，所以太阳是刚升起来的时候远，中午就近了。他们都根据日常生活的片面经验，判断了太阳在早上和中午的远近，得出了完全相反的结论。那时候，天文和物理知识还很幼稚，所以孔子也不能决定谁是谁非，而被讥笑了。
    太阳刚升时，夹在山水树木房屋等的里面，看起来就觉得大。到了中午，太阳在无穷的苍穹里，没有烘托，看起来就觉得小。另外，球形的太空，常常会被看成是扁平，因此造成了太阳有大小的错觉，所以单凭人们的眼睛来判断太阳与地面的距离是不正确的。
    地球表面包围着一层大气，旭日初升，光线是斜穿大气层到达地面，中午是近乎直穿大气层到达地面（注）。斜穿经过大气的路程长，被吸收去的热量就多；直穿经过大气层的路程短，被吸收的热量就少。并且斜穿的时候，地面单位面积上的照度小，因而热量少；直穿，单位面积上的照度大，因而热量多。另外，早上太阳刚出来时，地面热量尚未积蓄，晚上热量已逐渐消失，只有中午热量积储得最多，所以中午热而早晚凉。如果单凭太阳在人们感觉中的冷热来判断距离也是不正确的。
    地球不停地在运动着，一天翻一个身，叫做自转一次。现在我们假定地球只有自转，那末住在赤道上的人们，应当是早晨离开太阳远，中午离开太阳近。打个比方来讲，是容易理解的（见图甲）：假如车轮的转动算做地球的自转，轮带上“×”算做地球上的观察者，再把车轮底下的那条线算做是太阳。车轮转时，“×”跟直线接触，算做中午，此时距离最近（图一）。转过九十度，“×”跟直线的距离为车轮的半径，算做晚上（图二）。再转九十度，“×”跟直线的距离为车轮的直径，算做午夜，此时距离最远（图三）。再转九十度，“×”跟直线的距离又为车轮的半径，算做早上（图四）。继续再转九十度，“×”又跟直线接触了，这样就完成了一周。从这里可以知道，中午离太阳近，早晚离太阳远，午夜更远。
    如果“×”标在轮轴上（见图一、二、三、四），那末不管车轮的转不转，它跟直线的距离始终是轮子的半径，这好比地球两极上的观察者对太阳的距离，早晚与中午是完全相同的。
    观察者所在地的纬度越高，则早午太阳的远近，相差也越小。到了两极，就没有相差了。
    我们还可以用皮球来做一个比方：把皮球的任何一点算做北极，从北极穿过球心，跟它笔直相对的一点算做南极。在南北极之间划上一条圆圈线，算做赤道（见图乙）。皮球放在桌上，让圆圈线接触桌面来滚动。这样，不管皮球翻多少身，北极和南极两点，始终跟桌面上的直线距离不变。只有赤道上的某一点，也就是圆圈上的某一点，有时跟桌面接触，有时离桌面为球的半径，有时为球的直径。所谓纬度越高，就是离赤道越远，或者靠两极越近。从这里可以看出，球在滚动的时候，纬度越高的地方，跟桌面距离的相差是越小的。到了两极，就没有相差了。
    但实际上并不是这样简单，因为地球除自转以外，还有公转。这样使太阳的远近，不但跟地球的纬度有关，还跟一年间的各个时期有关。
    在北京观察太阳的远近，据天文学家的计算，从每年1月22日到6月5日，中午太阳比日出时远。2月初远一千公里；3月初远四千公里；4月初远六千四百公里。以后差别逐渐减小，直到没有差别。6月5日以后，中午太阳比日出时近。7月初近五千八百公里；9月中近一万六千公里。以后差别又逐渐减小，一直到第二年的1月22日以后，又周而复始了。这个数字，在最近一百年间都可以适用。
    〔注〕这是在我国地面上的情况。如果在赤道上，则春秋分时，完全直射。我国广州在夏至时，也几乎全是直射。（附图片）
