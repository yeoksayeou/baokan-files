Learning While Working, Diligence and Thrift in Pursuit of Education Becomes a Trend
The Practices of Middle School Students in the Handan Area are Worth Promoting

    (Our report) A trend of learning while working and pursuing education with diligence and thrift has formed among middle school students in the Handan area of Hebei Province.

    As early as after the floods in 1956, in order to persist in education work in the disaster area and prevent students from dropping out of school due to the disaster, secondary schools in the Handan area actively organized students to participate in after-school activities such as grass cutting, straw braid weaving, laboring to build schools, and engaging in agricultural production during vacations, and achieved remarkable results. Since the second half of 1957, in line with the policy of running schools with diligence and thrift and strengthening teachers' and students' labor exercises, the schools have further organized students to participate in a variety of activities such as accumulating fertilizer, watering wheat, cleaning up the campus, building roads, carrying coal, sewing and washing, and hairdressing.

    Through organizing students to carry out diverse after-school labor, not only has it solved the students' economic difficulties and saved state expenditures, but more importantly, it has improved the students' political awareness and cultivated good habits of loving labor. For example, Wang Weiqi, a student at Qiuxian No. 1 Middle School, has actively participated in production in the commune during every wheat and autumn vacation since entering middle school. In 1957, he worked a total of sixty-two workdays in fifty-eight days during the vacation. In addition, he participated in activities such as road construction and coal carrying at school. Because of learning while working, he not only solved the difficulties of family life, but also gradually realized the broad prospects of engaging in agricultural production, and prepared to be a socialist-conscious, cultured worker after graduation. Wo Shouxin, a student at Yongnian No. 1 Middle School, used to have the idea of ​​underestimating labor and did not even fetch water when he returned home. Last year, during the wheat and summer vacations, under the encouragement of his sister, he realized the importance of labor being glorious and actively participated in wheat harvesting and corn weeding, completing a total of seventy-eight workdays, equivalent to 113.5 yuan. After paying for his own food and book expenses for the whole year, he had nine yuan left and no longer received state scholarships.

    Judging from the experience of schools in various places, in the process of organizing students to participate in after-school labor, they have done a lot of ideological mobilization work to help students understand the importance of learning while working, reverse their ideas of underestimating labor, and establish a trend of diligence and thrift in pursuing education. When Daming No. 2 Middle School first established the straw braid weaving group in mobilizing students to participate in after-school labor, most students were still unwilling to participate, believing that going to school was for learning, not for laboring, and some also believed that it was shameful for middle school students to do this kind of work. After the school's Communist Youth League branch patiently educated them, explaining that underestimating labor and underestimating working people were the exploiting class ideas left over from the old society, it inspired the students' enthusiasm for participating in after-school labor, enabling 332 students to actively engage in the labor of weaving straw braids after school. In the process of organizing the hairdressing group, many students also believed that this was not a clever skill. After the school carefully calculated the accounts, it explained that the haircut expenses for all 802 students in the school amounted to about 800 yuan every six months. In order to save expenses, exercise students' labor viewpoints, and help students learn production skills, establishing a hairdressing group was a beneficial thing. Under the leadership of Class 13, students from other classes saw that they saved 80 yuan in one season, and many students had learned hairdressing skills, so it became popular in various classes. Many students reversed the idea that being a barber was not honorable. Yan Chengli from Class 22 said: I will definitely work as a barber after graduation.

    Through these discussions, the students unanimously believed that in order to build our country into a strong socialist country, the people of the whole country need to be diligent and thrifty, and work hard. It is a glorious and heroic move for young students to participate in labor exercises and pursue education with diligence and thrift. Some students have already made plans to participate in production during the winter vacation, and expressed that they will mobilize the majority of students to actively participate in production before and during the winter vacation, strengthen labor exercises, and establish a new trend of diligence and thrift in pursuing education.

### 边学习边劳动　勤俭求学成风气  邯郸地区中学生做法值得提倡

    边学习边劳动　勤俭求学成风气
    邯郸地区中学生做法值得提倡
    本报讯　河北省邯郸地区各中学学生边学习、边劳动，勤俭求学已成风气。
    早在1956年水灾后，为了坚持灾区教育工作，防止学生因灾失学，邯郸地区的中等学校就积极组织学生参加课余打草、编草帽辫、劳动建校、假期从事农业生产等活动，并取得了显著成绩。从1957年下半年，各校本着贯彻勤俭办校的方针和加强师生劳动锻炼的精神，又进一步组织学生参加了积肥、浇麦、清整校园、筑路、背煤、缝洗、理发等多种多样的活动。
    通过组织学生开展多样性的课余劳动，不但解决了学生的经济困难，节省了国家开支，而且更重要的是提高了学生的政治觉悟，养成学生热爱劳动的良好习惯。如丘县一中学生王维琦，从上中学后，每逢麦假、秋假都积极到社里参加生产。1957年利用假期，五十八天内总共作了六十二个工。此外在学校里不论是筑路、背煤活动他都去参加。由于一边学习、一边劳动，不但解决了家庭生活的困难，而且，逐渐认识到从事农业生产的远大前途，准备在毕业后做一个有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者。永年一中学生沃守信，由于过去存在轻视劳动的思想，回家后连水也不打。去年麦假、暑假在姐姐的带动下，认识了劳动光荣的重要意义，积极地参加了割麦、锄玉米，共做了七十八个工，合款一百一十三点五元，除开支自己全年的伙食、书籍费用外，还剩下九元，已经不再领国家助学金了。
    从各地学校的经验看，在各校组织学生参加课余劳动的过程中，都作了许多思想发动工作，帮助学生认识边学习、边劳动的重要意义，扭转他们轻视劳动的思想，树立起勤俭求学的风气。大名二中在发动学生参加课余劳动，刚刚建立草帽辫组时，多数同学仍然不愿参加，认为上学就是来学习的，不是来劳动的，也有的认为中学生干这种活是丢人的事，经过学校团总支耐心教育，说明轻视劳动和轻视劳动人民是旧社会遗留下来的剥削阶级思想，启发了同学们参加课余劳动的积极性，使三百三十二名学生积极投入了课余编草帽辫的劳动。该校在组织理发组的过程中，也有很多学生认为这不是什么高明的技术，经过学校细算账，说明每半年全校八百零二名学生理发费达八百元左右。为了节省开支，锻炼学生们的劳动观点，帮助学生学会生产本领，成立理发组是一件有益的事情。在十三班的带动下，别班同学看到他们一季就节省下八十元，并有不少学生都学会了理发技术，各班也普遍开展起来。不少学生扭转了认为当理发员不光彩的思想。二十二班阎成立说：毕业后我一定去作理发工人。
    通过这些讨论，学生们一致认为：为了把我国建设成为一个社会主义的强国，需要全国人民克勤克俭、艰苦奋斗。青年学生参加劳动锻炼、勤俭求学是光荣豪迈的举动。有些学生已经作好寒假参加生产的打算，并表示：在寒假前和寒假中要带动广大同学积极参加生产，加强劳动锻炼，树立起勤俭求学的新风气。
