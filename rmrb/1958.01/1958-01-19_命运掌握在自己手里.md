Fate is in Your Own Hands
Editor

    In the old society, working peasants had no way to control their own destiny; many people didn't know how they would live tomorrow, and some didn't even know where their next meal would come from after finishing the current one. Before agricultural cooperativization, although the lives of peasants had become much more stable than in the past, they still couldn't know what their year would be like at the beginning of each year. Because they engaged in scattered production, they were weak and powerless, and helpless in the face of natural disasters and diseases.

    “Knowing the whole year in advance” has finally appeared, and it is a product of agricultural cooperativization. How will each farming household live their year? How much income will they have in a year? Where will this income come from? How much will they get from the cooperative? How much will household sideline income be? How many workdays will a family do in the cooperative? How many workdays will they do in each month? How much can they pre-draw in each month? How much grain and cotton will the whole cooperative produce? How many pigs and sheep will be raised? How much dry land will be converted into paddy fields? How many barren mountains will be turned into green mountains? How much expenditure will the whole cooperative need in a year? How much income can be generated in a year? How much grain and money can be distributed for each workday? … After the cooperative cadres and all the cooperative members discussed and planned together, and after the cooperative members discussed and planned in their respective households, they can understand everything clearly at the beginning of each year. At the beginning of last year, the Qianjin Cooperative in Xiangyuan, Shanxi, listed the cooperative's plan and the plans of each cooperative member in a table, one for each family, and posted them on the wall. It was this table that filled the cooperative members with confidence and closely linked the hearts of the cooperative members with the interests of the collective. The cooperative members clearly saw the relationship between the total income of the cooperative and the amount of their own income, and they also clearly saw the relationship between the number of workdays they did and the amount of their own income. People not only went to work more actively, but also enthusiastically offered suggestions; more than 400 suggestions were offered in a year, thus increasing income and saving expenses by more than 9,000 yuan. Socialist living habits—doing things according to plan, doing things according to the principle of democratic centralism, and doing things according to the interests and will of the collective—have thus begun to develop.

    A year has passed. Although they suffered from a severe drought, many households who acted in accordance with "knowing the whole year in advance," did more workdays, and also developed more household sideline occupations, still increased their income; what about those who were unwilling to act in accordance with "knowing the whole year in advance"? They did fewer workdays, and their income was also less.

    We have already reached an era where we can control our own destiny, and we already have the conditions to control our own destiny. The question of "whether we can" control our own destiny no longer exists, and the remaining question is "whether we are willing to." The Qianjin Cooperative has already formulated the "knowing the whole year in advance" for 1958, and all members of the cooperative are advancing more energetically under its encouragement and guidance. They are "marching towards the river滩," developing water conservancy projects on a large scale. In this way, they will be able to control their own destiny more forcefully and further get rid of the manipulation of natural disasters. We wish the Qianjin Cooperative to advance even further, and we also hope that more cooperatives will learn from their good method and advance together with the Qianjin Cooperative.

    命运掌握在自己手里
    编者
    在旧社会里，劳动农民没法掌握自己的命运；有许多人今天不知道明天的日子怎样过，甚至吃上上一顿还不知道下一顿在哪里。在农业合作化以前，虽然农民的生活已经比过去安稳得多了，可是，在每年年初，还是没法知道这一年的日子会过成什么样子。因为他们分散生产，势单力薄，一遇到天灾和疾病就无能为力。
    “一年早知道”终于出现了，它是农业合作化的产物。每一个农家，一年的日子怎样过？一年能有多少收入？这些收入都从哪里来？从社里得到多少？家庭副业收入多少？一家人要在社里做多少劳动日？各个月份各做多少劳动日？各个月各能预支多少？全社要生产多少粮食、棉花？要养多少猪、羊？要把多少旱地改成水地？要把多少荒山变成绿山？全社一年需要有多大开支？一年能够有多少收入？每做一个劳动日就能分多少粮、多少钱？……经过社干部和全体社员在一起商量筹划，经过社员各家各户商量筹划，在每年年初就可以了解得一清二白。去年年初，山西襄垣前进社把社里的计划和社员各户的计划列成表，一家一张，贴在墙上。就是这张表，使社员们对前途充满了信心，把社员的心同集体的利益紧紧连结了起来。社员清楚地看到社里的总收入的数目字同自己的收入的数目字之间是什么样的关系，也清楚地看到自己做的劳动日的多少同自己的收入的多少有什么样的关系。人们不但更积极地出工，也更热心地献计；一年献计四百多条，因此增加收入、节省开支共九千多元。社会主义的生活习惯——按计划办事、按民主集中的原则办事、根据集体的利益集体的意志办事的习惯，就这样开始养成了。
    一年过去了。虽然受到了严重的旱灾，许多按“一年早知道”办事，多做了劳动日也多发展了家庭副业的户，仍然增加了收入；不肯按“一年早知道”办事的人呢？劳动日做得少，收入也就少了。
    已经到了自己掌握自己的命运的时代，已经有了自己掌握自己的命运的条件，“能不能”掌握自己的命运的问题已经不存在，剩下的问题就是“肯不肯”了。前进社已经制定了1958年的“一年早知道”，全社成员正在它的鼓舞和指导下更有精神地前进。他们正在“向河滩进军”，大兴水利。这样，他们就能更有力地掌握自己的命运，进一步地摆脱天灾的摆弄。祝前进社更前进，也希望更多的社学习他们这个好办法，同前进社一起前进。
