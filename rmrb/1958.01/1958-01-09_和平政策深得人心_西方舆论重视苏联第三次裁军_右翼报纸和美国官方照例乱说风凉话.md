(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency reports: The news of the Soviet Union's third disarmament has triggered strong reactions in Western newspapers. Many newspapers have welcomed this Soviet measure as conducive to easing international tensions. However, some right-wing newspapers and U.S. officials have attempted to downplay the significance of the Soviet Union's renewed disarmament, rehashing the old tunes of this being a "peace offensive" and having a "propaganda effect."

Parisian newspapers on the 7th prominently published summaries of the TASS statement regarding the Soviet Union's decision to further reduce its armed forces, using large headlines. Democratic newspapers viewed the TASS statement as a new manifestation of the Soviet Union's peace policy. "L'Humanité" pointed out that the Soviet government's decision is a new action conducive to easing international tensions.

Despite many bourgeois newspapers in France trying to portray the Soviet measure as a "peace offensive" or a "propaganda gesture," these newspapers had to admit, directly or indirectly, that the Soviet measure helps ease international tensions and puts Western countries in an even more passive position. "Le Monde" said that after announcing the above-mentioned decision to further reduce troops, "the Soviet Union has once again become the star on the international stage." "Le Figaro" linked the TASS statement with the British Prime Minister's recent speech on his willingness to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, and believed that the Soviet government's decision was a "concrete response to the abstract promises" of the West. "Paris Presse" emphasized that the Soviet Union is responding to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's decision to expand its military with the action of once again reducing its armed forces.

All West Berlin newspapers and most West German newspapers also prominently reported on the Soviet government's decision on the 7th. These newspapers especially emphasized that the troops being reduced in this batch include 41,000 Soviet troops stationed in the German Democratic Republic.

Hamburg's "Die Welt" pointed out that the Soviet Union's decision was announced at a time when international discussions on the resumption of negotiations between the East and West on disarmament and easing international tensions had reached a climax. Bonn's "General-Anzeiger," West Berlin's "Morgenpost," and "Telegraf" all emphasized that Western countries should follow the Soviet Union's example. "Neue Rhein Zeitung," which is close to the Social Democratic Party, believed that the Soviet decision represents a positive trend.

Some right-wing newspapers in West Germany attempted to downplay the significance of the Soviet government's peace-loving step, trying to make people believe that the Soviet Union's renewed reduction of troops seemed to be merely the result of the Soviet army's conversion to atomic and rocket weaponry.

In Rome, the Soviet government's decision was warmly welcomed by many Italian newspapers. "La Nazione" wrote that the purpose of reducing armed forces is to ease international tensions and promote the restoration of trust. In addition, the demobilization of 300,000 soldiers can also enable the Soviet state to save a lot of expenditure and put a large amount of manpower into the peaceful labor of further improving the material welfare of the people.

Belgian newspapers also believed that the Soviet Union's disarmament decision helps ease international tensions.

The Greek newspaper "Avghi" wrote that Western countries should follow the Soviet Union's example.

Many Norwegian newspapers also emphasized that the Soviet government called on Western countries to follow this example.

Canadian newspapers all published in the most prominent position the news from Moscow about the Soviet government's decision to further reduce its armed forces by 300,000 and its call for Western countries to follow "this sincere action." Canadian radio and television broadcast the news about the Soviet Union's reduction of armed forces several times.

The U.S. officialdom is deeply disturbed by the impact of the Soviet Union's renewed reduction of armed forces and is trying to downplay the significance of this decision. According to a report by a United Press reporter, the U.S. Department of Defense "does not want to comment" on the Soviet Union's statement of further reducing its armed forces by 300,000.

Associated Press reporter Ryan insisted that it seemed "one should not take seriously" "the news about the Soviet government's decision to reduce the Soviet armed forces by 300,000 again," this reporter said, because it has a "propaganda effect." "The New York Times" revealed a sense of unease in its editorial, noting that the steps taken by the Soviet Union "will bring it benefits," and the Soviet Union is good at "convincing the world of the Soviet Union's desire for peace and disarmament."

    和平政策深得人心
    西方舆论重视苏联第三次裁军
    右翼报纸和美国官方照例乱说风凉话
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联第三次裁军的消息，引起了西方国家报纸的强烈反应。许多报纸都表示欢迎苏联这个有利于缓和国际紧张局势的措施。但是，一些右翼报纸和美国官方却力图贬低苏联再次裁军的意义，重弹所谓这是“和平攻势”和“宣传作用”的滥调。
    巴黎各报在7日都在显著地位用大字标题摘要刊登了塔斯社有关苏联决定再次裁减武装部队的声明。民主报刊把塔斯社的声明看作是苏联和平政策的新表现。“人道报”指出，苏联政府的决定是有利于缓和国际紧张局势的新行动。
    尽管法国许多资产阶级报纸力图把苏联这一措施说成是“和平攻势”或“宣传姿态”，但是这些报纸也不得不直接或间接地承认，苏联这个措施有助于缓和国际紧张局势，它使西方国家更加陷于被动。“世界报”说，在宣布了上述进一步裁减兵员的决定之后，“苏联又一次成了国际舞台上的明星”。“费加罗报”把塔斯社的声明同英国首相最近关于愿意同苏联缔结互不侵犯条约的演说联系起来，并且认为，苏联政府的决定是对西方“抽象诺言的一个具体答复”。“巴黎新闻”强调说，苏联是用再一次裁减武装部队的行动来回答北大西洋集团关于扩充军备的决定。
    所有西柏林报纸和大多数西德报纸7日也在显著地位报道了苏联政府的这个决定。这些报纸特别着重地提到，在这批裁减的兵员中，包括四万一千名驻在德意志民主共和国境内的苏军部队。
    汉堡“世界报”指出，苏联的决定是在国际上关于东西方就裁军和缓和国际紧张局势重开谈判的讨论达到高潮的时候宣布的。波恩“总汇报”、西柏林“晨邮报”和“电讯报”都强调说，西方国家应当效法苏联的榜样。接近社会民主党的“新莱因报”认为，苏联这个决定代表着一种积极的倾向。
    西德一些右翼报纸企图贬低苏联政府这项爱好和平步骤的意义；企图使人相信苏联再次裁减军队似乎只不过是苏军改装原子武装和火箭武装的结果。
    在罗马，苏联政府的决定受到了意大利许多报刊的热烈欢迎。“国家报”写道，裁减武装部队的目的是缓和国际紧张局势和促进恢复信任的局面。此外，复员三十万士兵还可以使苏维埃国家节省大量支出，把大批人力投入进一步提高人民物质福利的和平劳动中。
    比利时报纸也认为苏联的裁军决定有助于缓和国际紧张局势。
    希腊“黎明日报”写道，西方国家应当遵循苏联的榜样。
    挪威许多报纸也强调指出，苏联政府呼吁西方国家效法这种榜样。
    加拿大各报都在最显著地位刊登了从莫斯科发来的关于苏联政府决定再裁减三十万武装部队的消息和它要求西方国家效法“这一诚意行动”的呼吁。加拿大广播电台和电视不止一次地广播了关于苏联裁减武装部队人数的消息。
    美国官方对苏联再次裁减武装部队的影响深为不安，力图贬低这个决定的意义。据合众社记者报道，美国国防部对苏联再次裁军三十万人的声明“不想发表意见”。
    美联社记者瑞安硬说，似乎“不应该认真地对待”“关于苏联政府决定再次裁减苏联武装部队三十万人的消息”，这个记者说，因为它有“宣传作用”。“纽约时报”在社论中流露出不安的情绪，这家报纸指出，苏联所采取的步骤“将给它带来好处”，苏联善于“使全世界相信苏联对和平和裁军的愿望”。
