Fifty Years of Combat
——Introducing the First Collection of "Historical Materials on the Fifty Years of the Chinese Spoken Drama Movement"
Bei Feng

    The first collection of Historical Materials on the Fifty Years of the Chinese Spoken Drama Movement, edited by playwrights Ouyang Yuqian, Tian Han, Xia Yan, Yang Hansheng, A Ying, Zhang Geng, Li Bozhao, and Chen Baichen, is about to meet readers. This is a joyous event in the publishing world. The thick volume of over three hundred pages, containing twenty-four recollections, records the historical facts of the spoken drama movement in different historical periods and in various aspects. From the Spring Willow Society's performance of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" in Tokyo in 1907, it is exactly fifty years to 1957. The articles collected in the first collection range from the founding period to the early stage of the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, which is the first thirty years of the fifty years. How did the Chinese spoken drama movement originate and develop during these thirty years? How did it cooperate with the Chinese revolutionary political movement? Under the leadership of the Party, how did it fight against the reactionary Kuomintang rulers and Japanese invaders? In the difficult days, how did it adhere to the principle of art serving politics, and how did it combine with the masses of the people? Here, a faithful record is left, in varying degrees of detail.

    Half a century of China has experienced two revolutions of different natures—democratic and socialist—and the democratic revolution itself has two stages of different natures, namely, the old democratic revolution and the new democratic revolution. During the long process of the old democratic revolution, Chinese bourgeois intellectuals were wholeheartedly yearning for the national rejuvenation movement led by Sun Yat-sen. When bourgeois intellectuals were advocating revolution, many educated youths responded to the revolutionary movement with actions, using the art form of drama to promote the principles of patriotism and national salvation. This is the historical background of the rise of early spoken drama—also known as new drama, or civilized drama. The establishment of new drama troupes like bamboo shoots after a spring rain around the founding of the Republic of China shows the true meaning of the statement that "Chinese spoken drama was combined with politics from the very beginning" (Note 1). The veteran playwright Ouyang Yuqian wrote two articles, "Recalling Spring Willow" and "Talking about Civilized Drama," totaling about 40,000 words, which very realistically narrated the founding of Spring Willow and made a fair comment on the decline of civilized drama (i.e., new drama).

    From the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927 to 1937, these ten years were "the most dangerous time for the Chinese nation." As Comrade Xia Yan pointed out in his article "The History of the Chinese Spoken Drama Movement and the Leadership of the Party" (Note 2), it was at this time that the Party led the Chinese literary and art movement, and the Party led the Chinese drama movement. In Shanghai, the Art Theatre Society was established with a clear-cut banner, and together with the South China Society, which had played a foundational role in the early spoken drama movement, and the Drama Cooperative Society, it greeted this difficult era with a fighting attitude. The transformation of the South China Society and Comrade Tian Han and other comrades played a key role in promoting the Chinese spoken drama movement. This collection reprints a part of Comrade Tian Han's "A Brief History of the South China Society" from his "Self-Criticism" written in 1930. Although it is only a part, it provides vivid and specific examples for today's readers to understand the South China Society and the depression and yearning of educated youths after the failure of the Great Revolution. The recollections of Comrades Xia Yan and Zheng Boqi about the Art Theatre Society further enrich our understanding of the revolutionary tradition of the spoken drama movement.

    The reactionary rulers' persecution of the progressive drama movement was increasing. The Art Theatre Society, the South China Society, and the May Flower Drama Society in Hangzhou were closed down one after another. Facing the white terror, progressive dramatists did not retreat under the leadership of the Party, but advanced more bravely. From Shu Xiuwen's recollection of "The May Flower Drama Society," we know that although "May Flower" was closed down, new drama societies, such as "Spring and Autumn," were established. This is truly like the wildfire that cannot be burned out, and the spring breeze blows again. The spring breeze is the Party. Under the leadership of the Party, the mass drama movement, the workers' drama movement, and the students' drama movement were even more active. Jin Shan's "Fragments of Recollection of the Blue Shirt Drama Society" well illustrates the Party's literary and art line in the drama movement at that time and its specific implementation.

    The Blue Shirt Drama Society and the Dadao Drama Society, led by the League of Left-Wing Dramatists in Shanghai, and the Blue Shirt Drama Troupe in the Central Revolutionary Base, judging from their performance activities and effects, had already initially solved the fundamental question of serving whom more than twenty years ago. Such a fundamental question was answered from the practice of the workers' and students' spoken drama movement in Shanghai, and a more complete answer was obtained from the spoken drama movement in the Central Revolutionary Base. Under different historical conditions, the spoken drama movement should flexibly adapt to the environment. After the failure of the Great Revolution, the spoken drama work in the Central Revolutionary Base, as seen from the recollections written by Zhao Pinsan, Li Bozhao, and Shi Lianxing, shows how arduous their work was and how much the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee cared about literary and art work. It is very touching to read, and these three recollections also enrich our understanding and knowledge of revolutionary history. Most spoken drama workers are not only unfamiliar with the early spoken drama movement, but also know little about the spoken drama movement in the revolutionary base areas. Some people even have the illusion that spoken drama is a theater art, so how can it be performed away from the stage, away from the theater, and away from the city? Even if it is performed, who is it for? If there are still people who have such naive questions today, it is hoped that this historical record can guide some drama workers who do not know the direction to take the correct path.

    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in the various border areas of the liberated areas, and in the enemy's rear, the hardship of spoken drama work was almost unimaginable. As mentioned in the postscript to the historical materials, "Spoken drama workers took the battlefield as the stage, and the stage was the battlefield of spoken drama workers." It is difficult for ordinary spoken drama workers to imagine that the artistic weapon of spoken drama could capture the enemy's fortress. The recollections of Comrades Li Mu and Liu Jia vividly tell us some examples of how afraid the enemy was of our propaganda weapon! It shows the educational role of spoken drama in publicizing to our military and civilians, and at the same time, what kind of effect it had on disintegrating the morale of the enemy and puppets!

    During the arduous eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the call of the Party, spoken drama workers established a national unified front organization—the China National Drama Circle Anti-Japanese Association. With its own organization in the drama circle, did every drama worker do his best to serve the War of Resistance? Except for the spoken drama in the liberated areas, which could really be used for anti-Japanese propaganda, in Shanghai in the occupied area and in the rear area, if drama workers wanted to fight for the right to perform, they had to fight against the reactionary rulers at the same time. In the first collection, there is no report on the drama movement in the isolated island and the drama movement in the rear area, while the situation of the work and struggle of the performing arts teams active in small cities, the first collection only publishes a general discussion. This is felt to be insufficient. More regrettable is that there is not a single article about the drama movement in Yan'an in the liberated area and other base areas (except for the three articles in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region), which shows the shortcomings in the work of soliciting contributions. The postscript to the collection of historical materials also mentions that this shortcoming must be vigorously overcome in the future, and the recollections of the liberated areas and the recollections of the performing arts teams will be the focus of the second collection. As readers, we eagerly hope that comrades engaged in drama work in the liberated areas will take the initiative to assist the historical materials editorial board in completing this arduous and glorious task.

    The overall impression is that the publication of the Historical Materials on the Fifty Years of the Spoken Drama Movement today is an extremely meaningful and valuable work. It has its own characteristics in the editorial work, that is, it attaches importance to historical facts. Through everyone's recollection, a more comprehensive general understanding of the historical facts of each period, each aspect, and each stage can be obtained. The narratives are mostly realistic and credible. The historical materials are also attached with some extremely valuable historical documents, and more than 40 precious pictures are also finely printed, which are even more vivid historical materials.

    After the serious political struggle of exposing and criticizing the bourgeois rightists in 1957, drama workers' eyes were brightened. The questions of who leads whom, the questions of experts and laymen, and the questions of the small at both ends and the big in the middle, have been refuted by the rumors and slanders of rightists Wu Zuguang, Dai Ai, and others with countless examples in the anti-rightist struggle. The facts cannot be obliterated, and historical facts are ironclad evidence. The publication of the collection of historical materials on the fifty years of the spoken drama movement is necessary and timely in the sense of anti-rightism. The younger drama workers, who live and grow up in a peaceful environment, do not understand or do not fully understand the Party's principles and lines in the major historical stages of the spoken drama movement. Today, through the historical materials, they can not only clearly recognize, but also clarify the direction of the current and future spoken drama movement, thereby increasing confidence and better serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    The history of the Chinese spoken drama movement is an important part of the history of Chinese revolutionary culture. At present, the collection and collation of the history of Chinese revolutionary culture has not been widely launched, and there are not many printed books. Therefore, the compilation and printing of the "Historical Materials on the Fifty Years of the Chinese Spoken Drama Movement" is a good start. The collection of historical materials has made the necessary preparations for the study of the history of spoken drama and the history of revolutionary culture, and provides reference materials, which are extremely valuable and credible materials. It is hoped that after the historical materials editing work is completed (it is said that three more collections will be compiled and published), we will soon be able to read the History of the Chinese Spoken Drama Movement.

    战斗的五十年
    ——介绍“中国话剧运动五十年史料”第一辑
    北风
    由戏剧家欧阳予倩、田汉、夏衍、阳翰笙、阿英、张庚、李伯钊、陈白尘领导编辑的中国话剧运动五十年史料第一辑即将和读者见面了，这是出版界的一个喜讯。厚厚的三百多页、二十四篇回忆，记载了不同的历史时期、各个方面的话剧运动的史实。从1907年春柳社在东京演出“黑奴吁天录”起，到1957年正好是五十年。第一辑中收集的文章，是从创始期开始到抗日战争爆发的初期止，也就是五十年中的前三十年。这三十年里，中国话剧运动是怎样创始和发展的，怎样配合中国革命的政治运动，在党的领导下，怎样向反动的国民党统治者和日本侵略者进行斗争的，在艰难的日月里，怎样坚持了艺术服务于政治这一方针，又怎样和人民群众相结合的……这里，繁简不一地留下了忠实的笔录。
    半个世纪的中国经历了两个性质不同的革命——民主主义的和社会主义的，而民主主义革命本身又有两个性质不同的阶段，即旧民主主义革命和新民主主义革命。在漫长的旧民主主义革命过程中，中国资产阶级知识分子倾心向往于孙中山领导的民族复兴运动，就在资产阶级知识分子鼓吹革命的时候，不少知识青年以行动响应了革命运动，运用戏剧这一艺术形式，宣传爱国救国的道理，这就是早期话剧——也就是新剧、亦称文明新戏兴起的时代背景。民国初建前后，新剧团体雨后春笋般的建立起来，说明“中国的话剧一开始就与政治结合着”（注一）这一句话的真实意义。老戏剧家欧阳予倩写了一篇四万字左右的“回忆春柳”和“谈文明戏”两文，非常详实地叙述了春柳创始的情况，并对文明戏（即新剧）的衰落作了公允的评述。
    1927年大革命失败之后，一直到1937，这十年是“中华民族到了最危险的时候”，正如夏衍同志在他的“中国话剧运动的历史与党的领导”（注二）一文中所指出的，就在这个时候党领导了中国的文艺运动，党领导了中国的戏剧运动。在上海，旗帜鲜明的艺术剧社成立了，配合在早期的话剧运动起过奠基作用的南国社，和戏剧协社等，以战斗的姿态迎接了这苦难的时代。南国社和南国社领导人田汉等同志的转变，对中国话剧运动起了关键性的推动作用。本辑中转刊了田汉同志在1930年写的“自我批判”中的一部分“南国社史略”，虽只是一部分，对于今天读者了解南国社，了解大革命失败后的知识青年的苦闷和向往，提供了生动而具体的实例。加上夏衍、郑伯奇几位同志对艺术剧社的回忆，更丰富了我们对于话剧运动的革命传统的认识。
    反动统治者对进步的戏剧运动的迫害是有加无已的，艺术剧社，南国社和杭州的五月花剧社先后被封闭，面对着白色恐怖，进步剧人在党的领导下不是撤退，而是更勇敢地前进了。从舒绣纹写的“五月花剧社”的回忆，我们知道尽管“五月花”被封闭了，新的剧社，如“春秋”又成立了。这真是野火烧不尽，春风吹又生。春风就是党，在党的领导下，群众性的戏剧运动，工人剧运和学生剧运是更其活跃了。金山写的“蓝衣剧社片断回忆”很好的说明当时党在戏剧运动方面的文艺路线，及其具体执行的情况。
    党在上海的左翼戏剧家联盟领导的蓝衣剧社，大道剧社，和在中央革命根据地的蓝衫剧团，从他们的演出活动和效果来看，远在二十多年前，就已经初步解决了为谁服务的问题，这样一个带根本性的问题，从上海的工人和学生话剧运动的实践得到了解答，从中央革命根据地的话剧运动得到了更完满的解答。在不同的历史条件下，话剧运动应该灵活地适应环境。大革命失败后，中央革命根据地的话剧工作，从赵品三、李伯钊、石联星写的回忆，看出他们的工作多么艰苦，党中央领导同志又是多么的关心文艺工作，读来非常感人，这三篇回忆，也丰富了我们对革命历史的了解与认识。一般的话剧工作者，不止是不熟悉初期的话剧运动情况，对于革命根据地的话剧运动也知道得不多。甚至有人有这种错觉，话剧是剧场艺术，离开舞台、离开剧场、离开城市怎么演呢？即使演又是给谁看呢？如果今天还有人有如此天真的疑问，希望这本史册可以引导某些不明方向的戏剧工作者走上正确的路。
    抗日战争期间，在解放区的各个边区，在敌后的敌后，话剧工作的艰苦几乎是难以想像的，正如史料编后记里提及的，“话剧工作者以战地为舞台，舞台也就是话剧工作者的战场”。一般的话剧工作者很难想像的，话剧这一艺术武器竟可以攻下敌人的堡垒。李牧、刘佳几位同志的回忆，生动地告诉了我们一些事例，敌人是多么害怕我们这一宣传武器呵！说明了话剧在向我军民宣传上起到怎样的教育作用，同时，对瓦解敌伪士气上又收到怎样的效果！
    抗日战争艰苦的八年，在党的号召下，话剧工作者成立了全国性的统一战线的组织——中华全国戏剧界抗敌协会。有了戏剧界的自己的组织，每一个戏剧工作者是否做到各尽所能地为抗战服务呢？除了解放区的话剧是真正有可能做到为抗日宣传外，在沦陷区上海，在大后方，戏剧工作者要争取演戏的权利，那末同时就要同反动统治者进行斗争。第一辑里关于孤岛剧运和大后方的剧运未见有一篇报道，而活跃在小城市里的演剧队的工作和斗争的情况，第一辑中仅刊有一篇概括性的论述。这是使人感到不足的。更遗憾的是关于解放区延安，和其他根据地的戏剧运动（除了晋察冀边区的三篇外）却一篇也没有，这里说明了组稿工作上的缺点。史料集编后记中也提到今后一定要大力克服这个缺点，而且解放区的回忆和演剧队的回忆将作为第二辑的重点。作为读者，热望在解放区从事戏剧工作的同志，主动地协助史料编委会完成这个艰巨而光荣的任务。
    总的印象，今天出版话剧运动五十年史料，是一件极有意义极有价值的工作。在编辑工作上有它的特点，就是重视史实，通过每个人的回忆，对每一时期、每一方面、每一阶段的历史事实可以得到一个较全面的概括认识。叙述大都做到朴实可信。史料并附印了一部分极有历史价值的文献，同时还精印了四十多幅名贵的图片，这些图片更是形象的史料。
    经过了1957年揭露和批判资产阶级右派这一严肃的政治斗争之后，话剧工作者眼睛明亮了，关于谁领导谁的问题，外行和内行的问题，两头小中间大的问题，在反右派斗争中无数的事例已经驳倒了右派分子吴祖光、戴涯之流的造谣和诬蔑。事实是不容抹杀的，历史事实就是铁的证据。话剧运动五十年史料集的出版在反右派这一意义上来说是必要的、及时的。比较年轻的话剧工作者，生活成长在和平环境里，对于党在话剧运动方面几个重大的历史阶段的方针路线是不了解或不够了解的，今天通过史料不止是能够明确认识而已，通过对史料的了解与认识，可以明确目前和今后话剧运动的方向，从而可以增加信心、更好地为工农兵服务。
    中国话剧运动史是中国革命文化史的一个重要的组成部分，目前对于中国革命文化史的收集整理工作尚未见普遍的发动，付印成册的也未多见，因此，“中国话剧运动五十年史料”集的编印是一个很好的开端。史料集对研究话剧史的、革命文化史的作了必要的准备工作，提供了参考资料，是极有价值的，可信的资料。希望史料编辑工作完成之后，（据说还要继续编印出版三辑）不久，我们可以读到中国话剧运动史。
