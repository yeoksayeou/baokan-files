Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 6th: Yu Xietian, a first-class revolutionary disabled soldier and Communist Party member who lost both hands in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, has earned more than 2,000 work points in the first eleven months of last year by overcoming all difficulties with revolutionary spirit to participate in labor. Yu Xietian was recently awarded the honorary title of "Active Element of Socialist Construction Among Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers" in Hubei Province.

Yu Xietian is from Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, and joined the Chinese People's Volunteers in 1950. During the Yuwang Mountain battle in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Yu Xietian lost both his hands to the extreme cold while clearing a mountain road covered in thick ice for fraternal units. What remained were two arm stumps resembling wooden sticks, with the remaining length of his two palms less than one-third of the original size. However, since his demobilization in 1952, Yu Xietian has persisted in participating in labor, and his labor ability has grown stronger year by year. Now, except for tasks requiring finger manipulation such as transplanting rice seedlings and harvesting wheat, he is adept at everything else: plowing, harrowing, collecting manure, pushing carts, carrying loads, applying fertilizer, and repairing dikes.

"How can you work without hands?" "Can a Communist Party member rely solely on the government for a living?" Yu Xietian was troubled by these questions when he first returned to his hometown after demobilization. After repeated contemplation, his answers to these two questions were "Yes!" and "No!"

Yu Xietian began his return to labor by learning to independently perform some daily life actions. Initially, he quickly learned simple actions such as putting on a hat, dressing, putting on shoes, and putting on socks. Subsequently, he devised ways to manage more complex actions on his own. For example, to wipe sweat off his back in the summer, he tied two rings to the ends of a towel and used his arm stumps to wipe it. While eating, he initially used the two palms pressed together to hold the spoon and bring it to his mouth. After several experiments, he used elastic bands to tie the spoon to his right arm stump and brought the food to his mouth. This man of peasant origin found the key to opening the door to labor in the fact that he could manage eating and dressing himself. He used the same method to exercise and actively participate in labor. He could do jobs that didn't require much use of hands (such as carrying and lifting), and he could also do jobs that required a lot of use of hands. The method was still to tie the tools to his arm stumps. When collecting manure, he tied the manure fork to his right arm stump. When harrowing the land, he tied the whip to his left arm stump and a two-jin wooden mallet to his right arm stump, driving the ox while carefully breaking up the clods of earth. Before each work assignment, Yu Xietian would first experiment with unfamiliar tasks at home, estimating how to tie the tools and figuring out how to exert force according to the characteristics of the tools, learning to use the tools before working with everyone else. In this way, he completed his tasks very well. Last spring, he led three commune members, leaving early and returning late, collected manure for seven days, completing the task of accumulating two to three thousand catties of fertilizer ahead of schedule.

Over the past few years, Yu Xietian has also learned seven or eight hundred characters and learned to write by tying a pen to his arm stump.

Yu Xietian is a leader in the face of arduous tasks. In February of last year, when the township was repairing the Baima Reservoir, the commune members were unwilling to jump into the cold, muddy ditch to collect soil. At this time, Yu Xietian resolutely jumped in first. The commune members were moved and followed him in. During the busy spring and autumn seasons, Yu Xietian knew that he could not transplant rice seedlings or harvest crops, but he was unwilling to lag behind. He always sought out jobs with high labor intensity and low work points. Sometimes, he would push a wheelbarrow carrying three hundred catties of cake fertilizer from the railway station thirty miles away to the commune, making two round trips a day without complaint. He regarded these as his obligations. Because Yu Xietian was willing to do any job and capable of doing any job, the commune members called him a "ready-to-use" team member.

According to Yu Xietian, to turn disability into usefulness, one must use the spirit of overcoming difficulties in the war to overcome the difficulties in labor. Overcoming difficulties is victory. When he first returned to his hometown after demobilization, some people, even his wife, did not believe that Yu Xietian could work, let alone work well. Every time he worked, his arms were chafed, and he hesitated, afraid that he would not be able to persevere. But when he thought of Chairman Mao's call for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to "maintain honor and carry forward honor," he forgot the pain and his courage grew even more. As time went by, he became more skilled in his work, learned more and more labor techniques, and Yu Xietian finally overcame the difficulties and dispelled everyone's doubts.

The commune members deeply admired and cared for Yu Xietian, fearing that he would overwork himself, and advised him to work less, but he refused. When Yu Xietian's arms were chafed and swollen, in order to avoid being dissuaded and hindering production, he always tried not to let others know. This tenacious spirit of labor greatly encouraged the commune members, who unanimously praised his enthusiasm and used him as an example to spur themselves on.

### 身体残废意志坚　战胜困难建家园  无手英雄余协田坚持参加劳动  荣获革命残废军人社会主义建设积极分子的称号

    身体残废意志坚　战胜困难建家园
    无手英雄余协田坚持参加劳动
    荣获革命残废军人社会主义建设积极分子的称号
    新华社武汉6日电　在抗美援朝战争中失去双手的一等革命残废军人、共产党员余协田，由于用革命精神克服一切困难参加劳动，在去年头十一个月得到了二千多个劳动工分。余协田最近获得了湖北省革命残废军人社会主义建设积极分子的光荣称号。
    余协田是湖北省孝感县人，1950年参加中国人民志愿军。在抗美援朝战争的鱼王山战役中，余协田在为兄弟部队开辟被厚冰遮盖着的山路的作业中，被酷寒夺去了他的两只手，剩下的是两只像木棒一样的臂膀，两个手掌剩下的长度还不到原来的三分之一。但是，余协田从1952年复员以来，一直坚持参加劳动，他的劳动能力一年强似一年。现在，除了还不能干像插秧、割麦这类用手指来操作的活计以外，犁地耙地、拾粪推车，挑挑抬抬，施肥修堤………，他样样都是一把好手。
    “没有手怎样劳动呢？”“一个共产党员能光依靠政府来过活吗？”余协田刚复员回乡的时候曾经为这些问题苦恼过。经过反复的思考，他对这两个问题的答案是“能！”和“不！”两个字。
    余协田恢复劳动是从学会独立的干一些生活动作开始的。起初，他很快就学会了戴帽、穿衣、穿鞋、穿袜等简单动作。随后，他又想出了办法自己来干那些比较复杂的动作。如夏季擦背上的汗，他就在毛巾的两头拴上两个环子，套在没手的肘子上去擦。在吃饭时，开头他用两个手掌顶在一起夹着匙子向口里送，经过几次试验，他又用松紧带把匙子绑在右肘子上，向口里送菜饭。这个农民出身的人，从吃饭、穿衣可以自己干的事实中，找到了打开劳动之门的钥匙。他又用同样的办法来进行锻炼，积极参加劳动。用手不多的活（如挑、抬）他能干，用手多的活他也干，办法还是把工具绑在没有手的肘子上面。在拾粪时，他就把粪叉绑在右面的肘子上；耙地时，他把鞭子绑在左肘上，并且右肘上还绑着两斤重的木榔头，一面赶牛，一面细心地打着土疙瘩。余协田为了在劳动中能熟练地运用自己的两个胳膊，每次出工之前，他先在屋里对生疏的活计进行试验，比量着工具的绑法，根据工具的特性捉摸怎样使劲，学会了使用工具再和大家一道去干活。就在这种情况下，他完成的任务非常出色，去年春天，他率领三个社员早出晚归，拾了七天粪，提前完成了积肥两三千斤的任务。
    几年来，余协田还学会了七、八百个字，学会把笔绑在肘上来写字。
    余协田在艰苦任务面前是个处处带头的人。去年2月，乡里补修白马水库，社员们都不愿跳到冰冷的污泥壪里去取土，这时余协田毅然先跳了进去，社员们被感动了，也都跟着跳进去。在春、秋两个忙季时，余协田知道自己不能插秧，不能收割，但也不甘落后，他总是找劳动强度大、工分少的活来干，有时从三十里开外的火车站，推着载有三百斤的独轮车向社里运饼肥，一天往返两次，毫无怨言。他把这些当作自己的义务。正由于余协田什么活都肯干、什么活都能干，社员们喊他为“听用”队员。
    按着余协田的说法，要变残废为有用，就要拿出在战争中克服困难的精神来战胜劳动中的困难，战胜困难就是胜利。还在他复员回乡初期，有些人，甚至他的爱人都不相信余协田能劳动，更没想到他能劳动好，他自己每当劳动的时候胳膊磨破了，心里也犹豫，怕坚持不下来，但一想到毛主席号召烈军属要“保持光荣，发扬光荣”的号召，就忘记了疼痛，勇气更大了。天长日久，劳动熟练了，学会的劳动技术越来越多，余协田终于战胜了困难，打破了大家的疑虑。
    社员们对余协田都十分钦佩关怀，怕他过分劳累，劝他少干点，但他不肯。余协田胳膊磨破了，发肿了，为了避免因大家劝阻妨碍了生产，他总是尽量不让别人知道。这种顽强的劳动精神，大大鼓舞了社员们，社员们都异口同声地夸奖他的干劲，并拿他作为榜样来鞭策自己。
