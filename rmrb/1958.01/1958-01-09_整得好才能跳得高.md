Only Good Rectification Allows for Higher Jumps
    Hui Zhi

    At the start of this New Year and the execution of the Second Five-Year Plan, the two major movements of production and rectification in the vast countryside have reached a climax. This vibrant and prosperous scene demonstrates that the Chinese people have sufficient ambition and drive to build their motherland.

    Production is about transforming nature, and rectification is about transforming thought. In the struggle to transform nature, thought can be transformed; and transforming thought is more conducive to transforming nature. The two transformations complement and promote each other. Those who understand this principle and act according to it will be invincible. Conversely, they will not be able to grasp either. Nine Wood Township in Changsha County, Hunan Province, did not implement the county party committee's decision to promote production through rectification. Township and commune cadres only paid attention to solving specific problems in production, and lightly skipped over the problems in the ideology and work style of the cadres that needed to be rectified. The rectification work stagnated for a long time, the masses had many opinions, and production was sluggish, leading to a decline in the local production upsurge. In other places, as soon as the production movement began, the rectification cadres were immediately withdrawn; some work teams, after leading the airing of views and debates, thought they had accomplished their mission, left behind a "Rectification Outline," and left with a flourish. Wherever the rectification work was abandoned halfway or hastily concluded, the production movement could not develop healthily.

    Why does this phenomenon occur? Apart from a few areas where cadres condone shortcomings, fearing getting burned, and deliberately going through the motions, the majority have an unclear understanding of the necessity of rectification and the relationship between rectification and production. Some comrades believe that: good production leads to good harvests, rectification is a waste of time and does not produce grain; or that: production has a time limit, while rectification can be done sooner or later, or even be dispensable. They also believe that: production and rectification cannot be taken care of at the same time and cannot be combined, grasping production will inevitably mean giving up rectification; or that: in "theory" the two can be combined, but in "practice" it is not the case.

    Is rectification dispensable? Countless facts deny this view. Why did farmers enthusiastically sell cotton and grain, enabling the state to complete procurement tasks ahead of schedule? Why has the labor attendance rate generally increased, and why has the national irrigated area expanded by more than 47 million mu in the three months before the New Year (equivalent to 50% of this year's plan, three times higher than the 1955 figure)? Isn't this the result of the previous stage of great debate and rectification? Some people do not see this point and do not acknowledge the role of rectification in promoting production, which is truly out of touch with reality. The Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Xiao County, Anhui Province, was originally a third-class cooperative, with many problems in financial management and cadre work style. Therefore, when the water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movement began, the cooperative members were not active. After the cooperative rectified its work style and improved its work based on the opinions of the members, the enthusiasm of the members rapidly increased, and more than 90% of the labor force was put into production; now this cooperative has completed the water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation tasks for the past winter and this spring ahead of schedule and exceeding its targets. Such examples are everywhere; it is not difficult to achieve them, the only question is whether one is willing to do so immediately.

    Can rural rectification be postponed? Of course, now that the winter production tasks are heavy and the work is very busy, it is impossible to rectify all cooperatives and completely solve all problems during this period. For cooperatives with fewer problems that do not affect production, rectification can be slightly delayed. However, for third-class cooperatives and third-class teams with more problems, rectification must be prioritized; otherwise, production cannot be carried out, or production will not be successful. Problems such as cadre work style, financial accounts, and poor households that seriously affect the relationship between cadres and the masses and the production mood of the masses must be resolved as soon as possible; otherwise, not only will it be impossible to further mobilize the production enthusiasm of the masses, but it will also be difficult to maintain the existing production enthusiasm. On the agricultural front, all localities and communes are striving for a great leap forward. It is impossible to imagine that a sick person can jump very high. To jump high in production, the cooperative must be rectified well to make it very healthy.

    Production and rectification are combined, and various places have created many good experiences and methods. The main reason for squeezing out rectification is not in the method but in the thought. When the thought is clear, the methods and experiences will follow. "Debate what you do, debate where you are unclear" is an effective experience. In places where production and rectification cannot be combined, it may be worthwhile to debate: is rectification really needed? Will rectification delay production? How can production and rectification be combined? After debate, the truth will become clearer and there will be more methods.

    整得好才能跳得高
    慧之
    在这新年新岁、第二个五年计划开始执行的时候，广大农村中的生产、整风两大运动达到了高潮。这种生气蓬勃的兴旺景象，表明了我国人民对建设祖国有着足够的雄心和干劲。
    生产就是改造自然，整风就是改造思想。在改造自然的斗争中可以改造思想；改造了思想也就更有利于改造自然。两方面的改造是相辅相成、互相促进的。凡是懂得这个道理、按照这个道理办事的，就无往而不利。相反，就一头也抓不牢。湖南长沙县九木乡没有执行县委以整风推动生产的决定，乡社干部只注意解决生产中的具体问题，把干部思想作风上需要整顿的问题轻轻放过，整改工作长期停顿，群众意见很多，生产消极，以致局部出现的生产高潮又趋回落。还有的地方生产运动刚一开展，马上就抽走了整社干部；也有的工作组在领导鸣放辩论以后，认为大功告成，丢下个“整改提纲”，便扬长而去。凡是把整风工作半途而废或草率收兵的地方，生产运动也都不能健康地发展。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？除少数地区是由于干部姑息缺点，怕引火烧身，存心走过场而外，大多数是对整风的必要性以及整风和生产的相互关系认识不清。有些同志认为：搞好生产能丰收，整风白误工，整不出粮食来；或者认为：生产有时间性，而整风是可迟可早甚至是可有可无的。他们又认为：生产和整风既不能兼顾又无法结合，抓了生产就势必要丢掉整风；或者认为：从“理论”上说两者可以结合，“实际”上不是那末回事。
    整风是可有可无的吗？数不尽的事实都否定了这个看法。为什么农民们踊跃出售棉粮，使国家征购任务提前完成？为什么劳动出勤率普遍提高，在年前三个月中全国扩大灌溉面积四千七百多万亩（相当于今年计划50％、比1955年数字高三倍）？这难道不是前一阶段大辩论和整改的结果吗？有人看不到这一点，不承认整风对生产的推动作用，这才真是不符合实际的。安徽萧县先锋农业社原是个三类社，财务管理和干部作风上都有不少问题，因此在兴修水利和积肥运动开始的时候，社员都不积极。社里根据社员意见整顿作风、改进工作以后，社员积极性迅速提高，90％以上的劳动力投入生产；现在这个社已经提前超额完成了去冬今春的兴修水利和积肥任务。这样的事例到处都有；要想做到也并不困难，问题只在于肯不肯立即照着办。
    农村整风可不可以推迟一些呢？当然，现在冬季生产任务大，工作很忙，要求在这期间把所有合作社都整顿一次，所有问题都彻底解决，是办不到的。问题少而又不影响生产的社，整风可以稍迟。但对于问题较多的三类社、三类队，必须抓紧首先整顿，否则就无法进行生产，或者搞不好生产。对于严重影响干群关系和群众生产情绪的干部作风、财务账目和困难户等问题，必须尽先加以解决；否则，不仅不能进一步发挥群众生产积极性，对现有的生产热情也很难保持。在农业战线上，各地各社都在力争大跃进。不可能设想，身上有病的人能跳得很高。要想在生产上跳得高，必须把合作社整顿好，使它十分健康。
    生产和整风相结合，各地已经创造了很多好的经验和办法。挤掉整风的主要原因不在方法上而在思想上。思想通了，办法、经验也就随之而来了。“做什么辩什么，那里不通那里辩”，这是一条行之有效的经验。生产和整风结合不起来的地方，不妨辩论一下：究竟需要不需要整风？整风会不会耽误生产？整风和生产怎样结合？经过辩论，道理就会更加明白，办法也就会更多了。
