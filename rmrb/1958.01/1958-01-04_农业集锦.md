    Agricultural Miscellany
    Newly Discovered Walnut Varieties
    In Qingtianhe Street, Shangnan County, Shaanxi, there is a walnut tree growing in a pigsty that bore fruit twice last year. After the first crop of walnuts matured, the tree immediately blossomed and grew leaves, bearing a second crop. While other trees have long withered and shed their leaves, this walnut tree remains lush and green.
    Ordinary walnut trees typically take ten years to bear fruit. However, a variety called "Alternating Year Walnut" has been discovered in Luojia Township, Fufeng County, which can bear walnuts in the second year after planting. In 1953, the Northwest Agricultural College transplanted this walnut variety to Wugong for trial planting, and indeed, young trees bore walnuts in the second year. This walnut variety has great economic value for developing mountainous areas, and the Horticulture Department of the Northwest Agricultural College is currently conducting further research on its propagation and cultivation.
    The hard shell of walnuts can be a burden for walnut lovers. However, a type of "Exposed Kernel Walnut" has now been discovered in Yongshou County. Its shell is very thin, and in some places, the kernel is exposed, making it very convenient to eat. According to investigations, the quality of this walnut is also excellent.
    Winter Peach
    In the northern foothills of the Qinling Mountains, there is a "Winter Peach" that still bears a tree full of fresh peaches in the cold winter. However, the taste is bland, the size is small, and the fruit yield is not high. Professor Lu Guangming, head of the Horticulture Department of the Northwest Agricultural College, used sexual hybridization in 1953, crossing water peaches with "Winter Peaches" found in Mei County. After four years of cultivation, four new varieties of winter peach trees have been cultivated. Last year, these trees all bore trees full of fresh peaches, some maturing in October, and some not yet mature. They are also large in size (each peach weighs more than five taels on average), juicy, high in sugar content, fragrant, and can be stored for more than a month without spoiling.
    Wild Cotton
    The Xunyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative discovered a type of wild cotton in the Xunyang mountain area, which can yield about 20,000 jin of cotton annually. The fibers of this wild cotton are as fine as those of cultivated cotton, but shorter. Although it cannot be used for spinning yarn and weaving cloth, it has strong cold-resistance and can be used with cultivated cotton to fill quilts and cotton-padded clothes.
    Bumper Chili Harvest
    The Jinyangchuan chili peppers from Yaoxian County, which are sold in Yunnan, Guizhou, and other parts of China, had another bumper harvest last year, with a yield of 1,600 jin per mu, a 40% increase over the previous year. These chili peppers are characterized by thick flesh, high oil content, and bright red color. Last year, the Shigou Agricultural Cooperative alone planned to sell 150,000 jin of dried chili peppers.

    新发现的几种核桃
    陕西商南县清沺河街有一株长在猪圈里的核桃树，去年结了两次果实。当这株核桃树第一次果实成熟后，马上又开花长叶，第二次结了核桃。目前其他树木早已枯黄落叶，而这株核桃树仍是青枝绿叶。
    普通核桃一般要过十年才开始结实。但是在扶风县罗家乡发现有一种名叫“隔年核桃”的品种，在种植后的第二年就可以结核桃。西北农学院曾于1953年将这种核桃移植到武功试种，在种植后的第二年，的确在幼树上结出了核桃。这种核桃品种对发展山区有很大的经济价值，目前西北农学院园艺系正在进一步研究其繁殖栽培问题。
    核桃的硬壳对于爱吃核桃的人是一种累赘。但是，现在在永寿县发现的一种“露仁核桃”，它的外壳非常薄，有的地方仁肉外露，吃起来非常方便。据调查，这种核桃的品质也很优良。
    冬季桃
    秦岭北麓地区有一种“冬桃”，在寒冷的冬天仍结着一树鲜桃子。但是味淡，个儿小，结的果子也不多。西北农学院园艺系系主任路广明教授，在1953年用有性杂交的办法，以水蜜桃和郿县发现的“冬桃”杂交，经过四年来的培育，已培育成四棵新品种的冬桃树。去年，这些树都结了满树的鲜桃子，有的在10月才成熟，有的现在还没有成熟，而且个儿大（每个桃子平均有五两多重），水分多，糖分高，有香气，还能够贮藏一个多月不坏。
    野生棉花
    洵阳县供销社在洵阳山区发现一种野生棉花，每年大约可以收获棉花两万斤左右。这种野生棉花的纤维和家棉一样细，只是短些，虽然不能用来纺线织布，但御寒力很强，可以用来和家棉一起装被褥和棉衣。
    辣椒丰收
    行销我国云南、贵州等地的耀县锦阳川辣椒去年又获丰收，亩产达到一千六百斤，高出前年产量40％。这种辣椒的特点是肉厚、油大，颜色鲜红。去年这个地区仅只饲沟农业社一个社，就准备出售十五万斤辣椒干。
