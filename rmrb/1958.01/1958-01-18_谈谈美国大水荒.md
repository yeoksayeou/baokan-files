    Talking About the Great American Water Shortage
    Fan Ruoyu
    Everything changes. Things that aren't a problem can become big problems. Wind and water are inexhaustible resources of nature, but who would have thought that even drinking water would become a major issue in modern America? "At any given time of the year, one in four Americans lives without adequate water," according to an article titled "America's Great Water Famine" in the December 11, 1957, issue of U.S. Newsweek.

    The "America's Great Water Famine" article begins with a "shot" depicting the water shortage in Fairfax County, Virginia: One morning, a housewife sleepily went to the kitchen to make coffee, but when she turned on the faucet, it only let out a "hiss" of dry air. She called a plumber, who replied sadly: "It's not the pipes, madam, our reservoir is dry; we've used up all our water." The article goes on to describe the alarming situation of water shortages and depletion in many American cities: In Dallas, Texas, residents lined up in long queues at water distribution stations, where a gallon of distilled water sold for fifty cents, more than gasoline. In the Portland area of Oregon, some faucets constantly spew out black, dirty sludge. Jersey City, the epicenter of the water crisis, has warned that it may have to import water and distribute it in small quantities, bucket by bucket. In Orland, the reservoir is completely dry. When the city started drawing water from its four artesian wells, the water level dropped rapidly, and one of the wells has already run dry. Chicago officials have warned that the city's water reserves are being depleted too quickly, and some manufacturers have had to search for new water sources as deep as 2,200 feet underground. Los Angeles is already transporting water from sources 400 miles away, but is now considering going as far as 600 miles to find new sources. In Chanute, Kansas, the water shortage was so severe in 1956 that sewer water was filtered and returned to the city for reuse. The article also quoted the U.S. Department of Interior's annual report on water supply, stating that most of the southern two-thirds of the United States is chronically short of water. In the Southwest and Northeast, water levels are at or near record lows. From Maine to California, rivers are flowing as slowly as a snail, and wells are running dry... After reading these examples of water shortages, one realizes that the article's earlier statement, "At any given time of the year, one in four Americans lives without adequate water," is not an exaggeration.

    One in four Americans living without water means that more than forty million Americans are living without water.

    We believe that everyone of goodwill and compassion for humanity, regardless of where such a shocking event occurs, would not discuss it with schadenfreude. What interests us is: Why has water, which was once an inexhaustible resource, become a depleted one in modern America? How can humanity prevent similar disasters from recurring?

    The "America's Great Water Famine" article also provides some information about the causes of this great water shortage. The article states that ironically, the average annual rainfall in the United States is thirty inches, but 70% of it is completely wasted, either flowing into the ocean or evaporating into the air. The article also says that another reason for the water shortage is the waste of water in irrigation, industry, and daily life, especially in modern industry. For example: "Manufacturing one and a quarter tons of steel for a 1958 automobile requires 18,000 gallons of water. Producing newsprint for a metropolitan Sunday newspaper requires more than half a ton of water. Manufacturing a modern summer suit of synthetic blend requires more than five tons of water." In short, the "America's Great Water Famine" article believes that the main reason for the American water shortage is that Americans waste too much water.

    The wasteful use of water in the United States is certainly related to the current severe water shortage. However, we feel that simply and generally attributing the American water shortage to the waste of water does not solve the problem. For example, regarding the waste of water in irrigation and industry, we do not know whether this refers to technical waste in irrigation and industrial water use, or whether irrigation and industry themselves are a waste of water? If it is the latter, then, in the situation where it is difficult to find new water sources, one either continues to maintain irrigation and industry, thereby further exacerbating the water shortage, or stops the development of irrigation and industry to save water. However, for modern humans, living without industry is almost as unthinkable as living without water. Humans need both water and industry.

    The development of modern industry was originally a great victory for humanity over nature, forcing natural forces to serve humanity and infinitely increasing human production. However, humanity has also suffered retaliation from nature as a result. Regarding this dialectical relationship in the history of humanity's struggle with nature, Engels wrote: "Let us not, however, flatter ourselves overmuch on account of our human victories over nature. For each such victory nature takes its revenge on us." This is not only due to the limitations of human experience in the struggle with nature, which prevent people from immediately and correctly understanding the laws of nature, but also due to the limitations of past modes of production, which prevent people from applying the laws of nature. When the American bourgeoisie used water to the greatest extent in large-scale industry, they did not consider the consequence that one in four people would not have water to drink today. If people pay attention to the situation in capitalist countries, they will find that the examples of people suffering from nature's retaliation due to the development of large-scale industry are not limited to the American water shortage. In the capitalist world, every capitalist tries his best to exploit nature for his own profit, regardless of the consequences. This is as Engels said long ago: "When individual capitalists are engaged in production and exchange for the sake of immediate profit, they can take into account only the nearest, most immediate results... In the present mode of production, nature and society are regarded primarily as instruments for enrichment. Later people are surprised to find that the more remote effects of actions directed to this end turn out to be quite different, most often quite the opposite of what was intended." Therefore, we cannot uncritically regard the current American water shortage as simply the inevitable result of the development of irrigation and industry, but must recognize that it is the inevitable result of the capitalist mode of production.

    In addition to complaining that people do not store rainwater and that irrigation and industrial water use is too wasteful, the "America's Great Water Famine" article also somewhat criticizes the behavior of those capitalists who only care about their own profits and disregard the consequences. The article states that to make matters worse, many major rivers in the United States have deteriorated to the point where they are almost impossible to dredge. A U.S. Department of Interior report bluntly stated: "We have turned most of our major rivers into uncovered sewers." It cost the state of Pennsylvania and the federal government $45 million to remove the silt and rubble that mine operators dumped into the Schuylkill River. The vast and tranquil Potomac River, which flows through the U.S. capital, is filled with sewage and industrial wastewater. Along the Verdigris River in Kansas, which supplies water to twelve cities, detergents are sometimes used so heavily that soap bubbles come out of the faucet. This illustrates that the real cause of the American water shortage cannot be generally attributed to its development of irrigation and industry, but should be accurately stated as being due to the anarchic development of irrigation and industry for the sake of capitalists' profits. When production is carried out for the sake of capitalists' profits in a state of anarchy, the occurrence of things like the American water shortage is inevitable.

    The "America's Great Water Famine" article is not without reason in attributing the American water shortage to people's waste of water. However, it should point out that this waste is an inevitable phenomenon of the capitalist mode of production. We know: "All animals waste food, and often destroy food that is still in the embryonic state. The wolf does not protect the doe that will give birth to a fawn for him next year like the hunter." (Engels) Capitalist society is the most civilized society compared to all previous societies, and the bourgeoisie is the most educated class compared to all previous ruling classes, but the capitalist mode of production, like all previous modes of production, has not yet truly and finally freed people from the animal state. Because these modes of production only pursue the nearest, most immediate, and useful effects of production, and no one cares about the later results that gradually arise through repetition and accumulation, this causes humanity to suffer retaliation from nature after each victory over nature. The American water shortage, in this sense, once again exposes the decay of the capitalist mode of production. It shows that in order for humanity to conquer nature and avoid retaliation from nature, it is not necessary to stop the development of large-scale industry, irrigation, and other production, but to end blind, anarchic production and begin to consciously and planfully develop production. Therefore, it is necessary to transform the capitalist mode of production and replace it with the socialist mode of production. When humanity becomes the true master in social relations, it can become the true conscious master of nature, and it can correctly use the laws of nature to conquer nature and avoid retaliation from nature. Therefore, Engels also pointed out that only in the socialist era, when a conscious social production organization with planned production and planned distribution is realized, "man first of all — in a certain sense finally — separates himself from the animal kingdom and passes from animal conditions of existence into really human ones". Those who oppose socialism, who oppose planned production and planned distribution, are therefore reactionary in that they oppose liberating humanity from the animal kingdom and oppose transforming humanity from animal conditions of existence into truly human ones. One doctor, who seemed unable to bear the suffering of residents in the American water shortage who had to drink unclean water, said: "Man is the dirtiest animal on earth." In fact, he should have said that those who, for their own profit, try to keep humanity forever in the animal state are the dirtiest animals on earth today.

    谈谈美国大水荒
    范若愚
    一切事情都会发生变化的。不成问题的事情，也会成为大问题。风和水，本来是天地间取之不尽、用之不竭的东西；但是，谁又料到现代化的美国，如今竟连喝水也成了大问题。“一年中总有一个时候每四个美国人中有一个人没有水过日子”，这是1957年12月11日美国“新闻周刊”发表的一篇题为“美国大水荒”的文章告诉我们的。
    “美国大水荒”这篇文章，是从描写美国弗吉尼亚州费尔克斯城缺水的惨状的一个“镜头”开始的：在某一天早晨，一位家庭主妇睡眼蒙眬地走到厨房去煮早点的咖啡，可是，当她拧开自来水龙头接水的时候，那水龙头只是“嗤”地一声放出了一些干燥的空气，此外什么都没有出来。她喊来了水管工人。水管工人忧郁地回答说：“这不是水管的毛病，太太，我们的蓄水池干了；我们的水全用完了。”接着，这篇文章叙述了美国许多城市供水不足和水已用尽的惊人情况：在得克萨斯州的达拉斯城，居民们在供水站前面摆开了长蛇阵，那里一加仑蒸馏水要卖五毛钱，比汽油的价格还高。在俄勒冈州的波特兰地区，有些水龙头尽流出些又黑又脏的泥浆，而且是常年如此。水荒最严重的地区中心泽西城已发出警告说，那里可能不得不从外面运水进来，要一桶一桶地小量分配了。在奥兰基，那里的蓄水池已经全干了，当这个城市开始从它的四个自流井中打水的时候，水位迅速下降，其中一口井已经干涸。芝加哥的官员们也发出警告说，那个城市的储水用得太快了，某些制造商已经不得不到深达两千两百英尺的地底下去找新的水源。洛杉矶现在已经是在四百英里以外的给水地点运水，可是又考虑要到六百英里以外去找新的水源了。堪萨斯州的查奴特城，1956年水荒极其严重，以至把阴沟里的水滤清以后再送回城里去重新使用。这篇文章还引了美国内政部关于供水情况的年度报告说，美国南面三分之二的地区大多数地方是常年供水不足的。在西南和东北，水位之低已经到了或接近于打破纪录的程度。从缅因州到加利福尼亚州，河水流动之慢简直像一条鼻涕虫在爬动，井水也都干了。……看过了这些水荒的例子，才知道这篇文章在前边所说的一句话：——“一年中总有一个时候每四个美国人中有一个人没有水过日子”，并不是故作惊人之语的。
    每四个美国人中有一个人没有水过日子，这就是说有四千多万美国人没有水过日子。
    这样一件骇人听闻的事情，不管这事发生在哪里，我们相信每一个善良的、对人类具有同情的人，都不会是以幸灾乐祸的心情来谈论这件事情的。引起我们注意的是：为什么从来是取之不尽、用之不竭的水，在现代化的美国却成为取之已尽、用之已竭的东西呢？人类怎样才能预防像美国已经发生的这种性质的灾难继续发生呢？
    关于造成美国这样的大水荒的原因，“美国大水荒”这篇文章也提供了一些材料。这篇文章说，成为水情恶化的讽刺的是：美国每年平均降雨量有三十英寸，但是其中有70％完全浪费去了，——一部分流入海洋，一部分蒸发到空气中去了。这篇文章还说，水荒的另一方面原因是美国在灌溉、工业和日常用水上的浪费，其中现代工业的用水量特别大。例如：“制造一辆1958年型汽车所需要的一又四分之一吨的钢，耗水一万八千加仑。制造一份大都市星期日新闻报的白报纸要半吨多水。制造一套现代夏装的人造混合料子要用五吨多水。”总之，“美国大水荒”这篇文章认为造成美国水荒的主要原因是美国人对水太浪费了。
    美国用水的浪费，对于造成美国目前的严重水荒当然是有关系的。但是，如果把美国的大水荒笼统地、简单地归咎于对水的浪费，我们觉得还没有解决了问题。例如，关于灌溉和工业用水的浪费，我们不知道这是就灌溉和工业用水的技术上的浪费而言，还是说灌溉和工业本身就是对水的浪费？如果是后者的话，那么，在很难找得新的水源的情况下，不是继续维持灌溉和工业从而继续扩大水荒，便是停止灌溉和工业的发展来节约水。可是，对于现代的人类来说，没有工业过日子同没有水过日子几乎是同样地不能设想的。人类是既要有水喝，也要有工业的。
    现代化的工业的发展本来是人类对自然界的大胜利，它迫使自然力为人服务，无限地增加着人类的生产。可是，人类也因此遭受到了自然界的报复。关于人类与自然界斗争史上的这种辩证关系，恩格斯写道：“我们不要过于得意我们对自然界的胜利。对于我们的每一次胜利，自然界都报复了我们。”这不仅是由于人类与自然斗争的经验不足的限制，使人不能立即正确地认识自然的规律；而且也由于人类过去的生产方式的限制，使人不能去运用自然的规律。当美国资产阶级尽量地把水用到大工业上的时候，他们是不考虑因此会造成今天四个人中有一个人没有水过日子的这一后果的。人们只要注意观察一下资本主义国家里的情况，就会发现那里由于大工业的发展使人们遭受到自然界的报复的例子，并不只是美国的大水荒一项。在资本主义世界，每一个资本家都是为了自己的利润想尽其所能地去利用自然界而不计其后果的。这也正如恩格斯所早说过的：“当个别资本家为着直接的利润去生产和交换时，他们只能首先注意到最近的最直接的结果。……对于自然界和社会，在今天的生产方式中，主要只重视最初的最显著的结果。后来人们才惊奇于为了达到上述结果所采取的行为的较远的影响是完全另外一回事，在大多数情形下甚至是完全和那种结果相反的。”因此，我们不能把美国当前发生了的大水荒不加分析地认为只是灌溉和工业的发展的必然结果，而必须认识这是资本主义生产方式的必然结果。
    “美国大水荒”这篇文章除了埋怨人们不去储蓄雨水和灌溉、工业用水太浪费以外，也多少指责了那些只顾自己的利润而不计后果的资本家们的行为。这篇文章说，使得事情更糟糕的是，美国许多大河流都败坏到几乎无从疏浚了。美国内政部的一份报告直接了当地说：“我们已经把我们大部分的主要河流变成没有盖的阴沟了”。为了挖掉矿井经营者们所倾倒在斯楚克尔河中的淤泥和碎石块，曾经费去宾夕法尼亚州和联邦政府四千五百万美元。而流经美国首都的辽阔而平静的巴托马克河充满了阴沟污水和工业废水。沿着堪萨斯州供十二个城市使用的?奥绍河，有时候清洁剂要用得如此之重，以致拧开水龙头流出来的尽是些肥皂泡沫。这也就可以说明，造成美国大水荒的真实原因，不能笼统地说是由于它发展了灌溉和工业，而应该确切地说，是由于它是为了资本家的利润而在无政府状态下发展了灌溉和工业。当生产是为了资本家的利润而在无政府状态下进行的时候，发生像美国大水荒这类性质的事情乃是不可避免的。
    “美国大水荒”这篇文章把美国的水荒归咎于人们对水的浪费，也并不是没有理由的。但是，它应该指出这种浪费乃是资本主义生产方式的必然现象。我们知道：“一切动物对食物都是浪费的，并且常常摧毁还在胚胎状态中的食物。狼不像猎人那样爱护第二年就要替他生小鹿的牝鹿。”（恩格斯）资本主义社会同它以前的一切社会比较是最文明的社会，资产阶级同它以前的一切统治阶级比较是最有教养的阶级，但是，资本主义生产方式却同它以前的一切生产方式一样，都还没有使人真正地最终地脱离了动物状态。因为这些生产方式都是只追求生产的最近最直接的有用的效果，而对于那些由于逐渐重复和积累才发生作用的到后来才出现的结果，始终是没有人去关心的，这就使得人类在每一次战胜了自然界之后又遭到了自然界的报复。美国的大水荒，正是从这种意义上又一次的暴露了资本主义生产方式的腐朽。它说明了人类为了能够征服自然界并且免遭自然界的报复，并不是要停止大工业、灌溉等等生产的发展，而是要结束盲目的、无政府状态的生产，开始有意识地有计划地去发展生产，因而就必须变革资本主义的生产方式，而代之以社会主义的生产方式。当人类在社会关系方面成为真正的主人翁的时候，它就能成为自然界的真正的自觉的主人翁，它就能正确地运用自然规律来征服自然界并且免遭自然界的报复。因此，恩格斯又指出，人类只有到了社会主义时代，实现了一个有计划地生产和有计划地分配的有意识的社会生产组织的时候，“人才第一次——在某种意义上最后地——脱离了动物界和从动物的生存条件转到真正人的生存条件”。那些反对社会主义的人，反对有计划地生产和有计划地分配的人所以是反动的，也就在于他们反对使人类脱离动物界，反对把人类从动物的生存条件转到真正人的生存条件。有一位似乎是对美国水荒中居民不得不饮用不洁之水的惨状看不下去的博士说：“人是地面上最肮脏的动物”，其实，他应该说，那些为了自己的利润企图使人类永远停留在动物状态中的人，才是如今地面上最肮脏的动物。
