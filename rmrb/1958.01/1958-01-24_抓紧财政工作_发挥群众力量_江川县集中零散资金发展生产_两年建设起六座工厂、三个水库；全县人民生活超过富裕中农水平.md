    Report from our correspondent Chen Yongjin: The secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Jiangchuan County Committee in Yunnan Province personally sought out sources of funding, accelerating industrial and agricultural construction.

    Jiangchuan County has a population of 130,000 and 160,000 mu of land, and is a newly emerging economic crop area. In the past, it only had a small 10-kilowatt generator for lighting. After the County Committee tightened its grip on financial work, in just two years, it built a semi-mechanized iron factory, as well as a flour mill, a phosphate fertilizer factory, a brick and tile factory, an oil pressing factory, and a confectionery factory, and also established a transportation team. The county's total industrial output value reached more than 600,000 yuan. In agriculture, three medium-sized reservoirs capable of irrigating 40,000 mu of land were built in 1956, and another three medium-sized reservoirs were started last year, increasing the irrigated land from 20,000 mu at the time of liberation to 100,000 mu. The per-mu yield of grain crops averaged 1,064 jin; six townships averaged 1,300 to 1,600 jin per mu. The average income of the county's population reached 77 yuan, exceeding the living standard of prosperous middle peasants before liberation, which was an average of 72 yuan per person.

    In the past, the county promoted many new-style agricultural implements, but there was nowhere to repair them when they broke down. After the iron factory was established, it repaired over 10,000 agricultural implements in 1956 alone. The factory's manufacture of more than 1,000 threshing machines greatly saved the peasants' labor and alleviated the labor shortage. In the past, the county's transportation capacity was weak. After the motorized transport team was established, flue-cured tobacco could be transported out quickly, and coal and other materials could be transported in quickly. Jiangchuan is an economic crop area in Yunnan that produces flue-cured tobacco and rapeseed. In the past, crop cultivation was often difficult due to a lack of fertilizer; at the same time, Jiangchuan's rapeseed had to be transported to other places for oil pressing, and then the oil cake had to be transported back as fertilizer. Now that the county has an oil pressing factory, this back-and-forth transportation has been greatly reduced. After the flour mill was established, it could grind more than 500,000 jin of flour a year, and the local people no longer had to buy flour from Kunming.

    How were these achievements made? Jiangchuan County's experience has two points: First, the County Committee grasped financial work tightly; second, it fully utilized the masses' financial and human resources.

    Hu Liangshu, the first secretary of the county party committee, told reporters: "Before 1955, we also knew that without reservoirs and pumping stations, increased production could not be guaranteed, but when we asked the financial staff, they said there was no money; building a little bit here and there relied entirely on asking for money from higher levels. After 1955, we ourselves seriously grasped financial work, and this work was often managed by a County Committee member, and as a result, there were many places to get money. In 1956, the Jiangchuan Hotel alone earned more than 80,000 yuan; other taxes such as slaughtering, market management, industrial profits, fisheries, transportation, and hairdressing, totaled more than ten kinds of revenue, of which the county could receive more than 300,000 yuan annually after remittance to higher authorities. Managing and concentrating these funds for use made it possible to carry out construction in a planned way; otherwise, they would be spent piecemeal."

    After concentrating these funds, they also paid attention to using them carefully and thriftily. The principle of making use of local conditions and being diligent and thrifty was implemented in construction. For example, almost all of the Jiangchuan Iron Factory's dozen or so machine tools were waste products bought from large factories. Some machine tools cost only more than 200 yuan, and the most expensive was only more than 1,000 yuan; if they bought brand new ones, they would cost 10,000 or 20,000 yuan. They only took out 3,000 yuan to establish the motorized transport team. They made their own horse-drawn carts, and the tires were second-hand goods bought from Kunming. Their self-made carts cost only 80 yuan each; buying them from Kunming would cost 150 yuan. After the establishment of this transportation team, it not only solved the local transportation difficulties, but also earned more than 10,000 yuan a year.

    The County Committee paid great attention to utilizing the manpower and financial resources of the masses to carry out production and construction. After agricultural cooperation, the financial resources of the masses were more abundant than before. As long as the masses were fully mobilized and the reason that production and construction could not rely solely on state funding was explained, the masses would take active action. Last year, Jiangchuan County spent more than 500,000 yuan on building reservoirs and buying pumping stations; of which the masses themselves contributed 250,000 yuan, the county contributed more than 200,000 yuan, and the prefecture and province invested 60,000 yuan. Of the three medium-sized reservoirs built in 1956, the prefecture gave 20,000 yuan, the county took out 40,000 yuan, and the rest was raised by the agricultural cooperatives themselves.

### 抓紧财政工作　发挥群众力量  江川县集中零散资金发展生产  两年建设起六座工厂、三个水库；全县人民生活超过富裕中农水平

    抓紧财政工作　发挥群众力量
    江川县集中零散资金发展生产
    两年建设起六座工厂、三个水库；全县人民生活超过富裕中农水平
    本报讯　记者陈勇进报道：中共云南省江川县委书记自己动手找财源，加速了工农业建设。
    江川县有十三万人口，十六万亩土地，是个新兴的经济作物区。过去这里只有一台照明用的十瓩的小发电机。县委会抓紧财政工作以后，仅仅在两年当中，就建设了一个半机械化的铁工厂，建设了面粉厂、磷肥厂、砖瓦厂、榨油厂、糖果厂，还建立了一个运输队。全县工业产值达到六十多万元。在农业方面，1956年修了三个能灌溉四万亩土地的中型水库，去年又动工修建三个中型水库，使水浇田从解放时的二万亩增加到十万亩。粮食作物的亩产量，平均达到一千零六十四斤；有六个乡平均每亩达到一千三百斤到一千六百斤。全县人口的平均收入达到七十七元，超过了解放前富裕中农每人平均七十二元的生活水平。
    过去，这个县推广了很多新式农具，但是坏了没处修理。铁工厂建立以后，1956年一年就修理了上万件农具。这个厂制造的一千多部打谷机，大大节省了农民的劳力，缓和了劳动力紧张的局面。过去这个县运输力量薄弱，汽马车运输队建立以后，烤烟已能迅速地运出去，煤炭等也能很快地运进来。江川是云南出产烤烟、油菜的经济作物区，过去因为缺乏肥料，农作物种植起来常常发生困难；同时，江川的油菜要运到外地去榨，榨过油后再运回油枯当肥料。现在县里有了榨油厂，这种往返运输就大大减少了。面粉厂建立以后，一年可以磨面五十多万斤，当地人民再也不用从昆明买面了。
    这些成绩是怎么来的？江川县的经验有两条：一是县委抓紧财政工作，一是充分发挥群众的财力、人力。
    这个县的县委第一书记胡良恕同志对记者说：“1955年以前，我们也知道没有水库、抽水机，不能保证增产，但是一问财政人员，他们就说没有钱；星星点点地建设一点，全靠向上级要钱。1955年以后，我们自己认真地抓财政工作，这项工作经常有一个县委委员负责管理，结果出钱的地方多得很。1956年只江川饭店就收入八万多元；其他如屠宰、市场管理、工业利润、渔业、运输、理发等十几种税收，除上交外，县里每年可以收入三十多万元。把这些钱管理起来，集中使用，就可以有计划地进行建设；不管，也就零花掉了。”
    他们把这些资金集中起来以后，又注意了精打细算地使用。在建设中贯彻了因陋就简、勤俭节约的方针。如江川铁工厂的十多部机床，几乎都是从大工厂里买来的废品，有的机床只花了二百多元，最贵的才一千多元；如果买全新的，就要一两万元。他们建立汽马车运输队，也只拿出三千元。自己制马车，轮胎是从昆明买来的旧货。他们自制的马车，每辆才合八十元；从昆明买，要一百五十元。这个运输队成立后，不仅解决了当地运输上的困难，每年还可赚回一万多元。
    县委会很注意发挥群众的人力、财力，进行生产建设。农业合作化以后，群众的财力比以前雄厚了，只要充分发动群众，说明生产建设不能光靠国家给钱的道理，群众就会积极行动起来。去年江川县用于修水库和买抽水机的钱，有五十多万元；其中群众自己拿出二十五万元，县里拿出二十多万元，专区和省投资六万元。1956年修的三个中型水库，专区给了两万元，县里拿了四万元，其余都是农业社自己筹的款。
