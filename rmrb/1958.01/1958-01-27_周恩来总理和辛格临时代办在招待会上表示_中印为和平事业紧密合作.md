Xinhua News Agency, January 26th – At a grand reception held this afternoon by Indian Chargé d'Affaires to China, Mr. Singh, in celebration of the eighth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of India, Premier Zhou Enlai and Chargé d'Affaires Singh reiterated the determination of China and India to continue working together to maintain world peace and ease international tensions, and to further develop the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries.

    At the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended warm congratulations to the government and people of our great neighbor, expressing his firm belief that they will make even greater contributions to maintaining world peace and easing international tensions in the new year. He said, "The Chinese government and the Chinese people are willing, as in the past, to cooperate closely with the Indian government and the Indian people for the cause of peace, and to advance hand in hand."

    In his speech, Premier Zhou focused on the fact that the Indian government and Prime Minister Nehru have repeatedly called for disarmament and the prohibition of the use and testing of nuclear weapons, putting forward many valuable suggestions, and have recently expressed a positive attitude towards convening a summit conference of major powers and concluding a non-aggression treaty between the East and West. Premier Zhou said, "These efforts by India have already had a very positive impact internationally. The Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world warmly support and praise these efforts by the Indian government and Prime Minister Nehru."

    Premier Zhou emphasized, "The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China and India have been increasingly and indisputably recognized by more and more countries as the necessary and possible guidelines for international relations. Although imperialist elements are still doing everything possible to create international tensions and intensify activities to expand armaments and prepare for war, this does not indicate their strength at all, but rather indicates their fear of the strength of the forces of peace."

    Premier Zhou said, "The soaring will of the Asian and African people to oppose colonialism and oppose war and the spirit of unity demonstrated at the recent Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, as well as the various peace initiatives put forward by peace-loving countries such as the Soviet Union, India, and Poland to further promote the relaxation of the international situation, are bringing a new and hopeful peaceful prospect to the world situation."

    At the reception, attended by more than 400 Chinese and foreign guests, Chargé d'Affaires Singh also said in his speech: "All of India's efforts in the international arena are aimed at easing international tensions. The peaceful resolution of world problems on the basis of mutual cooperation rather than hostility has been, and will continue to be, the policy of our government."

    Chargé d'Affaires Singh also said, "We believe that this attitude of mutual cooperation is possible only when the Panchsheel, the Five Principles jointly initiated by our two countries – India and China – are universally accepted as the principles guiding relations between all countries." He also pointed out that because India and China are the two most populous countries in the world and have a long-standing friendship that is becoming increasingly close, China and India can play a special role in maintaining world peace.

    When talking about the friendly cooperative relations between China and India, Premier Zhou believed that the profound friendship between the two countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence has made new and significant developments in the past year, and he firmly believed that the friendly cooperation between the two countries will surely achieve even broader development in the new year. He emphasized that this friendly relationship is not only conducive to the peaceful construction of both countries, but also of great significance to maintaining peace in Asia and the world. Chargé d'Affaires Singh also pointed out in his speech that the friendship and cooperation between India and China "not only conform to the interests of our two countries, but also to the interests of the entire world."

    Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen and Shen Junru, Vice-Premiers Chen Yi and Nie Rongzhen, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Burhan Shahidi, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China were invited to attend the reception. The Indian delegation who visited our country after attending the Asian-African Solidarity Conference also attended today's reception.

    周恩来总理和辛格临时代办在招待会上表示
    中印为和平事业紧密合作
    新华社26日讯　在印度驻中国大使馆临时代办辛格今天下午为庆祝印度共和国成立八周年而举行的盛大招待会上，周恩来总理和辛格临时代办再次表示中印两国决心继续为维护世界和平与缓和国际形势而共同努力，并且进一步发展两国的友好合作关系。
    周恩来总理在招待会上代表中国政府和人民向我们伟大邻邦的政府和人民致以热烈的祝贺，深信他们将在新的一年中为维护世界和平与缓和国际形势作出更大的贡献。他说：“中国政府和中国人民愿意像过去一样同印度政府和印度人民为和平的事业紧密合作，携手前进。”
    周总理在讲话中着重谈到了印度政府和尼赫鲁总理曾经一再为裁减军备、禁止核武器的使用和试验发出呼吁，提出了许多有价值的建议，最近又对召开大国最高级会议和缔结东西方互不侵犯条约表示了积极的态度。周总理说：“印度的这些努力已经在国际间发生了十分良好的影响。中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民热烈支持和赞扬印度政府和尼赫鲁总理的这些努力。”
    周总理强调指出：“中印两国共同倡导的和平共处五项原则已经更加无可争辩地被越来越多的国家承认为指导国际关系的必要和可能的准则。尽管帝国主义分子还在千方百计地制造国际紧张局势，加紧扩军备战的活动，但是这绝不表示他们的强大，而是表示他们对和平力量强大的恐惧。”
    周总理说：“最近亚非人民团结大会所表现的亚非人民反对殖民主义、反对战争的昂扬意志和团结一致的精神，以及苏联、印度、波兰等爱好和平的国家为了进一步促进国际局势的和缓而提出的各项和平创议正为世界局势带来一个新的、有希望的和平前景。”
    在有中外人士四百多人参加的招待会上，辛格临时代办也在讲话中说：“印度在国际上的一切努力都是以和缓国际紧张局势为目的。在相互合作而不是敌对的基础上和平解决世界的问题一直是，今后也将继续是我国政府的政策。”
    辛格临时代办还说：“我们认为，只有在我们两国——印度和中国——所共同倡议的潘查希拉即五项原则被普遍接受为指导所有国家之间的关系的原则时，这种相互合作的态度才有可能。”他并且指出，由于印中两国是世界上人口最多的两个国家，并且有着越来越密切的悠久友谊，因此中国和印度在维护世界和平方面可以起着特别的作用。
    在谈到中印两国的友好合作关系时，周总理认为两国基于和平共处五项原则的深厚友谊在过去一年中已经有了新的重大发展，并且深信在新的一年中两国的友好合作还必将获得更加广阔的发展。他强调指出这种友好关系不仅有利于两国各自的和平建设，并且对维护亚洲和世界和平也有着重大的意义。辛格临时代办在讲话中也指出，印中两国的友谊和合作“不仅符合于我们两国的利益，而且符合于整个世界的利益。”
    应邀出席招待会的，有李济深、沈钧儒副委员长，陈毅、聂荣臻副总理，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，外交部副部长章汉夫和各国驻华使节。出席亚非团结大会后来我国访问的印度代表团也参加了今天的招待会。
