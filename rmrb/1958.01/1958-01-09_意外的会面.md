    An Unexpected Encounter
    Wei Shi
    The typist Song Yuying pushed open the door and was immediately stunned. Not only did her eyes widen instinctively, but her legs also seemed to have taken root in the ground, unable to move a step.
    She never expected to see her younger sister, Song Yulan, in her home.
    Half a year ago, Yulan finished junior high school in her hometown. She didn't pass the entrance exam for high school, and wrote several letters to her sister asking her to find her a job in the provincial capital. She said that after studying for so many years, it would be a waste to stay in the countryside. Her parents also supported her wish, wanting Yuying to do her best to solve this "future problem" for the seventeen-year-old girl. Yuying repeatedly wrote back tactfully, trying to persuade her to focus on agricultural labor, and told her that this was the best path for junior high school graduates who didn't pass the entrance exam. However, the letters kept coming. Finally, Yulan even said, "You have a child, and you have to hire someone anyway, so hire me!" She said at the end of her letter, "Being your nanny is better than farming, because I can still find time to read books. But if I farm? My life is over."
    This letter greatly angered Song Yuying, and even when she wrote back, her angry mood hadn't calmed down, so her reply was very impolite. She directly rejected Song Yulan's request and lectured her, saying it was wishful thinking. "It's true I hire someone, but I won't hire someone like you who is unwilling to engage in agricultural labor!" She even said at the end that she would soon go to the countryside to participate in production.
    After that, Yulan didn't write anymore. Yuying sent two more letters, but didn't receive any reply.
    And now, that country girl suddenly appeared before her.
    When Yulan saw her sister come in, she nonchalantly went up to her and greeted her affectionately:
    "Sister, you're off work!"
    "Yulan, you..." It was with great difficulty that Yuying turned from a daze to calmness.
    "You still think I'm here to be your nanny, right?" Yulan said with a grin, while looking at her sister's two-year-old child, who was now running from the front of the table, "No, you guessed wrong!"
    Yuying opened her mouth, about to say something, when Yulan handed her a well-preserved piece of paper, which read:
    "Comrade Song Yulan: The province has decided to convene a meeting on farmland water conservancy on the 26th of this month. You have been selected as a delegate from this county to attend. Please report to the county seat immediately..." At the end was the county people's committee's scarlet seal.
    "You understand now, Sister?" the junior high school graduate said happily, "I'm here in the provincial capital for a meeting. Of course I had to come see you! It's a bit sudden, but the meeting date is so close, I didn't have time to write a letter!"
    "Yulan, you..." Yuying was surprised again. When did her sister become a representative for a water conservancy meeting? It had only been two or three months since they last communicated, and she had actually settled down in the countryside? Yuying simply couldn't believe it was true. But the county people's committee's scarlet seal was so clear, and her sister was definitely here in her home.
    Yulan said, "Here's what happened: more than two months ago, didn't you write in your letter that you were also going to the countryside to participate in production?..."
    She was talking about that very strict letter from Yuying. When she first received it, she thought her sister was lying to her, and didn't want to read it after reading half of it, but later, cadres were really sent to her village to work in the countryside.
    "Even Secretary Liu of the county party committee came down," Yulan recalled the scene at the time, "He carried a bedroll and said he was settling down in our village. The next day, he went to the fields to dig sweet potatoes. Many college students came down to collect manure..."
    Yulan quickly wiped away the tears she shed because she hadn't passed the school entrance exam, rolled up her sleeves and trouser legs, and threw herself into the ranks of the peasants. It was as if she wanted to atone for her past contempt for agricultural labor. In the fields, in the threshing ground, in front of the pigsty, on the edge of the manure pit, she worked day and night. After the sweet potatoes and peanuts were all in the warehouse, she led a dozen women to dig ditches and canals near their village. It was the first time women had done such work there, so...
    "So the county gave us special care, not only sending people to help us often, but also sending me to the province to learn from advanced experiences in other places." Yulan said here in one breath, her face flushed.
    During dinner, the older sister asked, "Why didn't you write all this time?"
    The younger sister said shyly, "It's my fault, I'm lazy. Besides, I thought there was nothing to tell you, I had figured things out, so what was the point of bothering you!"
    Yuying patted her younger sister on the shoulder forcefully, and said with a smile, "You little rascal, once you've figured things out, you don't need your sister anymore!"
    The sisters joked around for a while, and the younger sister asked with concern, "Aren't you going to go down to the countryside too? Has the date been set?"
    Yuying said, "I'm leaving in less than a week. Your brother-in-law is going too. We're preparing to notify the people back home!..."
    "What about your little Mao Mao?"
    "We're temporarily sending him to his grandma's house. Grandma isn't too old, so she can take care of him."
    "What about your nanny?"
    "Oh," the older sister pursed her lips, "Everyone has left, what's the point of having a nanny? Not only have we saved on our nanny, but many other families have saved on nannies too."
    "Sister!" Yulan called out, but didn't continue. She thought of the days from half a year ago to three months ago, thought of her idea of going to the city to be a nanny and her request to her sister. "Oh, how could I have been so muddle-headed back then!" She couldn't help but blame herself, while covering her red face.

    意外的会面
    韦石
    打字员宋玉英推开屋门，一下子楞住了。不光是眼睛出于本能地瞪大起来，两条腿突然间也像在地上生了根似的，一步也挪不动。
    她想不到她妹妹宋玉兰出现在她的家里。
    半年以前，玉兰在家乡念完了初中，没考上学，几次来信要姐姐给她在省城找个工作。她说，她念那么多年书，留在乡下太可惜了。爹妈也支持她这种愿望，要玉英尽力解决这位十七岁的女孩子的“前途问题”。玉英几次婉转地去信开导，要玉兰安心地参加农业劳动，并且告诉她：这是考不上学的初中毕业生最好的出路，可是，信还是来，最后，玉兰甚至说：“你有个孩子，反正得雇人，你雇我吧！”她在末了的那封信上说，“当你的保姆，也比种庄稼强，因为我还可以抽出空来看看书。可是种庄稼呢？我一辈子就完了。”
    这封信大大地激怒了宋玉英，直到写回信时，愤慨的心情还平静不下来，所以她那封回信，措词很不客气。她直截了当地拒绝了宋玉兰的要求，并且教训她说，这是妄想。“我雇人是不错，可我不雇你这种不愿意从事农业劳动的人！”末了还说，就连她不久也要下到农村参加生产。
    以后，玉兰没有再来信。玉英又去了两封信，也没有收到回信。
    而现在，那乡村姑娘突然地出现在她的面前。
  玉兰看到姐姐进来，却若无其事地迎上去，亲热地跟她打招呼：
    “姐姐，你下班啦！”
    “玉兰，你……”玉英好不容易才从发呆的境地转向平静。
    “你还以为我是来给你当保姆吧？”玉兰嬉皮笑脸地说，一边看着姐姐那个两周岁的、现在从桌子前边跑过来的小孩子，“不，你猜错了！”
    玉英张了张嘴，正要回答些什么，玉兰递给她一张保存得很好的纸头，上边写着：
    “宋玉兰同志：省里决定在本月26日召开农田水利会议，你被选为本县列席代表，请即来县城报到……”末尾是县人民委员会的朱红色的印鉴。
    “你明白了吧，姐姐？”那个初中毕业生兴高采烈地说，“我来省里开会。还能不到你这儿看看你！来得是突然些，可开会的日期那么近，我来不及写信呀！”
    “玉兰，你……”玉英又吃了一惊，妹妹几时成了水利会议的代表人物了？才两三个月没通信，她居然在农村安下心来？玉英简直不相信这会是真的。可是县人委的朱红印鉴印得是那样清楚，妹妹又千真万确地出现在她家里。
    玉兰说：“是这么一回事：两个多月以前，你不是写信说，你也要下乡生产吗？……”
    她说的就是玉英那封措词很严厉的信。她刚刚收到时，认为姐姐是在骗她，看了一半就不想看了，可是后来她们村庄上，当真来了下放的干部。
    “连县委刘书记都下来啦，”玉兰追述当时的情景说，“他背了个行李卷，说是在咱们那儿落户，第二天，就下地挖白薯。好些大学生，都下来拾粪。……”
    玉兰很快地揩干了因为考不上学校而流泻的泪水，卷起了袖子和裤腿，投入到农民的行列里了。她好像要赎取过去轻视农业劳动的罪过似地，在田野上，在场地里，在猪圈前，在粪坑边沿，夜以继日地干活。当白薯、花生统统进到仓里以后，她又率领了十几个妇女，在她们村庄的附近，挖沟开渠。在那里，妇女做这样的活，是破天荒的头一次，所以……
    “所以县里对我们特别照顾，不单经常派人来帮助，又派我来省里学习外地的先进经验。”玉兰一口气说到这里，面孔都涨红了。
    吃饭的时候，姐姐问：“你为什么一直不来信呢？”
    妹妹不好意思地说：“这怪我不好，我懒。再说我想着也没啥事，我思想搞通了，还搅和你干什么！”
    玉英在妹妹肩上用力地拍了一下，笑着说：“你这小鬼啊，思想通了，就不要姐姐啦！”
    姐妹俩闹了一阵子，妹妹关心地问：“你不是也要下去吗？日子定了没有？”
    玉英说：“我不出一个星期就走，你姐夫也去，正准备通知老家的人哪！……”
    “你们的小毛毛怎么办呢？”
    “我们暂时把他寄到他奶奶家里。奶奶年岁还不太大，可以照顾得了。”
    “你们的保姆呢？”
    “哎哟，”姐姐撇嘴了，“人都走光了，还用什么保姆？不光是我们的保姆省下了，好多人家的保姆都省了。”
    “姐姐！”玉兰喊，却没有往下说。她想起半年前一直到三个月以前的那段日子，想起她要进城当保姆的念头和向她姐姐的请求。“我呀，我那时怎末那样糊涂呢！”她情不由己地埋怨起自己来，一边说一边捂着通红的面孔。
