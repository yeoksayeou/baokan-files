    Don't Forget Thrift During the Spring Festival
    Everyone is discussing the question of "Is this wasteful?". I believe that while participating in the discussion, everyone should take immediate action. For example, the Spring Festival is approaching. Based on the principle of diligence and thrift in managing a household, how should this year's Spring Festival differ from previous years? How can we make this festival both enjoyable and economical? This is a specific question that should be considered now.
    When people mention celebrating the New Year and festivals, the first things that come to mind are: eating, dressing, and having fun. Some families would rather economize on weekdays in order to spend more money during the New Year and festivals. It is reasonable to want to improve living standards and have a good time during the New Year and festivals.
    However, what I want to suggest is that improving living standards should be planned. This not only needs to consider how much money to spend but also whether it is beneficial to the health of adults and children. Based on this spirit, please plan: how much money can you spend on New Year's goods? Will it affect your future life? Which New Year's goods are essential? Which ones are optional? In the spirit of thrift, how much money can you save this year compared to previous years? With such a comprehensive consideration and careful arrangement, waste can naturally be avoided.
    Secondly, when you take money to the market to buy New Year's goods, you should try to choose items that are nutritious and inexpensive. If you encounter a shortage of certain non-staple foods – many people want to buy them, but the supply is limited – it is best not to compete for them.
    Thirdly, during the Spring Festival, you should naturally participate in some recreational activities to enliven our spiritual life. However, participation should be moderate, and you shouldn't turn rest into fatigue, which would affect your work and study after the holiday.
    Finally, during the Spring Festival, are there wasteful habits in your area or unit, such as mutual entertaining and gift-giving? If so, we should lead by example and change these habits. Chao Zhong

    过春节莫忘节俭
    大家正在讨论“这是浪费吗？”的问题，我认为大家在参加讨论的同时，就要立即有所行动。比如，春节就要到了，根据勤俭持家的原则，今年过春节和往年该有哪些不同？怎样才能把这个节日过得既愉快又不多花钱？这是当前应该考虑的一个具体问题。
    一提到过年过节，人们首先想到的是：吃、穿、玩乐。有些人家宁可平日省吃俭用，也要在过年过节时多用些钱。过年过节要改善生活，要玩得痛快，这是合情合理的要求。
    不过，我想提出的，是改善生活要有计划。这不仅要考虑到该用多少钱，还要考虑对大人孩子的身体健康是否有益。根据这个精神，请你计划一下：你可以拿出多少钱来办置年货？会不会影响你今后的生活？哪些是必须买的年货？哪些是可买可不买的？根据节约的精神，今年比往年能省下多少钱？有了这样一个全面的考虑和周密的安排，浪费的现象自然可以避免。
    其次，当你拿着钱到市场上去买年货的时候，应该尽可能地挑选那些营养价值高、价钱便宜的物品。如果碰到某些副食品供应不足的情况——想买的人很多，供应量却有限，这时，最好不必去争相抢购。
    再次，过春节自然要参加一些文娱活动，活跃活跃我们的精神生活。但是参加活动要适度，不要把休息变成了疲劳，以至影响到假日后的工作和学习。
    最后，在春节期间，在你们地区或单位有没有互相请客和馈送礼物等浪费习惯？如果有，我们应该以身作则，改变这些习惯。　抄中
