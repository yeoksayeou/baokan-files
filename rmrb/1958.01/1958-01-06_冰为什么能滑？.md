Why is Ice Slippery?

Now, it's ice skating season in the North. People can freely skate on the ice once they put on ice skates. Why is ice slippery?

When we put on ice skates and step onto the ice, our weight of several dozen kilograms is concentrated on the small area of the ice blade (about fifteen square centimeters). Each square centimeter of ice is subjected to a force of several kilograms, and this pressure causes the ice to melt. When gliding begins, friction is generated between the ice and the ice blade. This friction is converted into heat, and the heat will melt a very thin layer of ice under the ice blade into water. This water acts as a lubricant, greatly reducing the friction. We then use our feet to push alternately on the ice, adding a little thrust, and we can glide smoothly.

Because the weather is cold, the melted water will freeze again after the ice blade passes. Therefore, we can see a white trace left where the ice blade has passed. (Shan)

    冰为什么能滑？
    现在，北方正是滑冰的季节。人们穿上冰鞋即可自由自在地在冰上飞舞。冰为什么能滑呢？
    当我们穿好冰鞋，一踏上冰块的时候，我们的几十公斤的体重，全加在像冰刀那样大小面积（大约十五平方厘米）的冰块上，每平方厘米冰所受到的力有几公斤重，这压力就使冰块融化；当滑行开始时，冰块与冰刀间产生了摩擦力，这种摩擦力即转变为热，而热又会使冰刀下面很薄的一层冰融化成水，这水就起了润滑油的作用，大大减小了摩擦力。我们再用脚左右交递地在冰上加一点推力，就可顺利地滑行了。
    因为天气寒冷，在冰刀走过以后，融了的水又会冻上，所以我们可以看到在冰刀经过的地方会留下一道白色的痕迹。　（山）
