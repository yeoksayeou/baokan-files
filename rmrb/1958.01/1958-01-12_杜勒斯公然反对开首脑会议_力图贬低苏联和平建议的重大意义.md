Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 11th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stated at a press conference on the 10th that he rejected the Soviet proposal to hold a summit meeting of heads of government in the next two or three months.

In response to reporters' questions, Dulles said that he had "not yet studied carefully" Bulganin's letter to Eisenhower on the 9th, but he immediately stated that he did not think a top-level meeting should be held with the Soviet Union. He also dismissed Bulganin's new initiative, which put forward a series of significant peace proposals, as a "propaganda ploy."

Dulles also said that before holding a summit meeting, the Soviet Union must first demonstrate "sincerity" and accept the U.S.'s "preconditions," such as agreeing to the Western countries' proposals for resolving the German question. He stated that the United States advocates holding diplomatic negotiations or foreign ministers' meetings first to "prepare" for such "preconditions."

Dulles once again made it clear that the United States opposes stopping nuclear weapons tests and opposes banning the use of nuclear weapons, and it does not intend to accept the Soviet disarmament proposals. The United States will adhere to its proposal that has deadlocked disarmament negotiations. He said that even if disarmament talks are resumed, the U.S. position will not change.

One reporter asked Dulles whether, judging from his remarks, it could be assumed that he was not enthusiastic about holding any talks with the Soviet Union. Dulles's answer actually confirmed this. On the one hand, he admitted that the U.S. and the Soviet Union currently have "common interests in certain areas," and that "neither the Russians nor the Americans themselves want to live in a world where everyone could be destroyed." However, he then tried his best to cast doubt on negotiations, saying that it was impossible to reach a "reliable" agreement with the Soviet Union.

Regarding Dulles's attitude, even reporters directly pointed out to him in their questions that foreign newspapers and critics in the U.S. Congress have been saying that the Soviet Union has seized the initiative in the "peace movement" while the U.S. is in a passive position. Dulles tried his best to deny this, insisting that the Soviet Union was inferior to the United States. The reporter followed up by asking him why the Soviet Union's so-called "bad policies" were "louder" and more influential than the U.S.'s "good policies." Dulles had to admit that this was the case, and his explanation was that this was due to "propaganda techniques."

    杜勒斯公然反对开首脑会议
    力图贬低苏联和平建议的重大意义
    据新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯10日在记者招待会上，表示拒绝苏联提出的在今后两三个月内召开各国政府首脑会议的建议。
    杜勒斯在回答记者的问题时说他对布尔加宁9日给艾森豪威尔的信“还没有很仔细研究”，但是他马上就说，他并不认为应该同苏联举行最高级会议。他并且又把布尔加宁提出一系列重大和平倡议的新行动，说成是“宣传伎俩”。
    杜勒斯还说，在举行最高级会议以前，苏联先要表明“诚意”，要接受美国的“先决条件”，例如要同意西方国家解决德国问题的主张。他表示，美国是主张先举行外交谈判或者外长会议，来“准备”这样的“先决条件”。
    杜勒斯又一次明白表示，美国反对停止试验核武器、反对禁止使用核武器，它也不打算接受苏联的裁军建议。美国将坚持它使裁军谈判陷于僵局的建议。他说，即使裁军谈判复恢了，美国的立场也不会改变。
    有记者问杜勒斯，从他的发言看来，是否可以假定他对于同苏联举行任何的会谈都不热心。杜勒斯的回答实际上证实了这一点。他一方面承认，美苏两国目前在“某些方面具有共同利益”，“俄国人或者美国人自己都不希望生活在一个大家都可能被毁灭的世界上”。但是，他接着就竭力对谈判散布怀疑，他说同苏联谈判不可能达成“可靠的”协议。
    对于杜勒斯这种态度，甚至记者们在向他提问题时都直接指出，外国报纸和美国国会里批评他的人一直在说，在“争取和平运动”中苏联掌握了主动而美国处境被动。杜勒斯竭力企图否认这一点，硬说苏联不如美国。记者紧跟着问他，为什么他所谓的苏联的“坏政策”反而比美国的“好政策”“说得响些”，影响更大呢。杜勒斯不得不承认这是事实，他的解释是，这是由于“宣传技术”的关系。
