Soviet Cultural Briefs

	Tsiolkovsky's Prediction

	It was recently discovered that Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the founder of modern rocket science and interstellar travel theory, maintained correspondence with Soviet filmmakers. In a recently published letter, dated January 24, 1935, to a filmmaker, he illustrates his early anticipation of the achievements of Soviet science in conquering space.

	In the letter, he states: "I always believed that cosmic velocity (i.e., eight to seventeen kilometers per second) flight would not be achieved for hundreds of years. Our and other countries' insignificant accomplishments proved this point. But due to continuous work, my pessimistic view has recently been shaken, because a method has been found that will achieve amazing achievements in just a few decades. I believe that the efforts and costs made by our Soviet government to develop Soviet industry and various research projects will prove that my wishes are correct."

	New Ballet "Joan of Arc"

	The Soviet State Moscow Musical Theatre recently performed a new ballet "Joan of Arc," written by Boris Platonov and composed by Nikolai Peyko, which was warmly welcomed by Muscovites.

	This ballet is based on the story of Joan of Arc, the famous French female national hero of the Hundred Years' War. Joan of Arc was originally a shepherdess. Seeing her fellow villagers ravaged by the English army, she led 3,000 people to defeat the English invaders and was warmly loved by the people, becoming the leader of the people. The characters in the play are very vivid and touching. At the end of the play, the victorious French people in the roaring Royai Yang Square held high the brave Joan of Arc, who firmly believed in the justice of her cause.

	"Astronomical Almanac" for 1960

	The Institute of Theoretical Astronomy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences recently published the "Astronomical Almanac" for 1960. This book provides astronomers, geodesists, and navigators with accurate materials for astronomical observations. The newly published "Almanac" has been improved according to the recommendations passed by the International Astronomical Union at representative conferences in Rome and Dublin, thus greatly improving the accuracy of many important parts of the "Almanac." In particular, it should be pointed out that the "Almanac" has added some data that are very necessary for conducting physical observations of planets and the moon.

	Life of Lenin Woven on Large Felt

	Workers at the Baku felt weaving factory in the Soviet Union recently made a huge and magnificent felt, woven with more than seventy fragments of Lenin's life.

	The felt covers an area of ​​75 square meters, equivalent to 675 square city feet. More than 200 colors of wool were used in the weaving process, which interweave into ever-changing colors. This felt was woven to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

    苏联文化简讯
    齐奥尔科夫斯基的预见
    最近发现，现代火箭运动和星际交通理论的创始人齐奥尔科夫斯基曾经跟苏联电影工作者保持通讯关系。在最近第一次发表的信中，有他在1935年1月24日写给一个电影工作者的一封信。这封信说明他很早就预见到苏联科学界在征服宇宙方面所取得的成就。
    他在信中说：“以前我一向认为要在数百年以后才能实现宇宙速度（即每秒八公里到十七公里）的飞行。我们和国外已有的那些微不足道的成果也证实了这点。但是由于连续不断的工作，我这种悲观的看法最近已经动摇了，因为只要经过几十年就能取得惊人成就的方法已经找到了。我相信我们苏联政府为了发展苏联的工业和各种研究工作而作出的努力和付出的代价会证明我的愿望是正确的。”
    新芭蕾舞剧“贞德”
    苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院最近演出了由鲍里斯·普拉托诺夫编剧、由尼古拉·佩科作曲的新芭蕾舞剧“贞德”，受到莫斯科人热烈的欢迎。
    这个舞剧是根据英法百年战争中著名的法国女民族英雄贞德的故事编写的。贞德原来是一个放牧姑娘，她看乡亲遭受英军的蹂躏，就率领三千人击败英国侵略者，受到人民热烈的爱戴，成为人民的领袖。剧中人物形象非常生动感人。剧终时，胜利的法国人民在火堆熊熊的罗瓦伊杨广场上把英勇的、坚信自己事业的正义的贞德高高举起。
    1960年的“天文年历”
    苏联科学院理论天文学研究所最近出版了1960年的“天文年历”。这本书为天文学家、测地学家和航海家进行天文观测提供了准确的材料。新出版的“年历”已经根据国际天文组织在罗马和都柏林代表会议上通过的建议作了一些改进，因此得以大大地提高“年历”许多重要部分的准确性。特别应该提出的是，“年历”中增加了对行星和月球进行物理观测时很需要的一些资料。
  大毛毡上织出列宁的生活
    苏联巴库织制毛毡的工人前不久制成了一块巨大瑰丽的大毛毡，上面织着七十多幅列宁生活的片断。
    这块毛毡的面积有七十五平方公尺，合六百七十五平方市尺，编织过程中用了二百多种颜色的毛线，它们交织成千变万化的色彩。这块毛毡是为了庆祝十月革命四十周年而织的。
