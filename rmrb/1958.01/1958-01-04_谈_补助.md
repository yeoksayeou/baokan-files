    On "Subsidies"
    People's Bank of China, Jilin Provincial Branch, Han Jiang

    In rural areas, some people rely solely on relief or loans for a living; in urban organizations, some people rely solely on subsidies for their livelihood. Among these people, many are lazy and unwilling to work.

    During our organization's discussions about going to the countryside and going up to the mountains, some people raised concerns, saying: "In the organization, there are subsidies for living difficulties. Who will be responsible if we have living difficulties after going to the countryside?" The issue of "subsidies" has even become a reason or condition for whether or not to go to the countryside and up to the mountains.

    Here, we cannot but study the issue of subsidies. To facilitate the study, let's first give a few examples:

    According to people's exposure, a certain cadre ate half refined grains and half coarse grains when there were no subsidies; with subsidies, they ate all refined grains. Another cadre ate meat or chicken and drank alcohol once every half month when there were no subsidies. After the subsidies, they changed to eating meat or chicken and drinking alcohol once a week.

    So people called "subsidies" "expenses to improve life."

    Why is this? Some cadres have poor character and apply for subsidies even when they are not experiencing difficulties, that is one reason; the staff in charge of welfare work are bureaucratic, do not investigate and understand beforehand, and do not supervise and inspect afterwards, approving applications as long as they are submitted, that is the second reason; why are there subsidies? What is its meaning? There is no publicity or explanation, that is the third reason.

    These three reasons lead to one result: it wastes the country's money, causes mass resentment, and turns a good thing into a bad one.

### 谈“补助”

    谈“补助”
    人民银行吉林省分行  寒江
    在农村里有的人专靠救济或贷款吃饭；在城市机关里有的人专靠补助生活。这些人之中有不少是好吃懒做的。
    我们机关里在讨论下乡、上山时，有人提出意见说：“在机关生活困难有补助，下乡后生活困难谁负责？”“补助”问题居然也成为能不能下乡、上山的理由或条件了。
    在这里我们不能不对补助问题研究一下。为了便于研究先举几个例子：
    据人们揭露，某干部在不补助时，吃的是一半细粮、一半粗粮；有了补助，就全部吃细粮。另一个干部在不补助时，半月吃一次肉或鸡，喝一回酒。补助后改为每星期吃一次肉或鸡，喝一回酒。
    于是人们把“补助”又叫做“改善生活的费用”。
    这是因为什么呢？某些干部品质不好，生活不困难也申请补助，这是其一；掌管福利工作的人员官僚主义，事先不调查了解，事后又不监督、检查，只要申请就批准，这是其二；为什么要补助？它的意义在哪里？既不宣传又不解释，这是其三。
    这三个原因得出一个结果：既浪费了国家的钱，又使群众意见满腹，把好事办坏了。
