Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 12th: Many factories and mines of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company have made outstanding contributions in the first ten days of this year's production.

The workers of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant produced more than 500 tons of seamless steel tubes for the country in the first ten days and created ten new production records in a row during these ten days. In 1957, the workers of this factory over-fulfilled the state plan by producing more than 17,000 tons of seamless steel tubes. This year, they proposed a plan to produce more than 20,000 tons of seamless steel tubes more than the actual production in 1957. If this plan is achieved, this factory will exceed its original designed production capacity by 66%.

The No. 1 Medium Plate Plant, which had failed to meet the state plan almost every month last year, has also completely changed its appearance in the high tide of industrial production. Since the beginning of this year, it has over-fulfilled the plan almost every day, producing more than 1,000 tons of medium plates for the country in the first ten days. The No. 1 Steelmaking Plant plans to produce 200,000 tons more steel this year than last year's plan. The steelmaking workers, full of energy, produced more than 400 tons of steel for the country in the first ten days. In addition, the No. 1 Primary Rolling Plant, the No. 1 and No. 2 Thin Plate Plants, the Small Rolling Mill, and others have also over-fulfilled their production plans for the first ten days.

    鞍钢今年头十天
    无缝钢管厂增产五百多吨  第一中板厂扭转落后局面
    新华社鞍山12日电　鞍山钢铁公司许多厂矿在今年头十天的生产中，作出了出色的贡献。
    无缝钢管厂的职工，在今年头十天中共为国家增产了五百多吨无缝钢管，并且在十天中连续创造了十一次生产新纪录。这个工厂的职工在1957年超额为国家增产了一万七千多吨无缝钢管，今年又提出要比1957年实际还要多生产两万多吨无缝钢管的计划。实现这一计划，这个工厂就将超过原设计生产能力的66％。
    去年几乎月月都完不成国家计划的第一中板厂，在工业生产高潮中也完全改变了面貌。今年以来差不多天天都超额完成了计划，头十天中就为国家增产了一千多吨中板。第一炼钢厂今年计划生产的钢比去年的计划增加了二十万吨，鼓足干劲的炼钢工人们在头十天中就为国家增产了四百多吨钢。此外第一初轧厂、第一、第二薄板厂、小型轧钢厂等也都超额完成了头十天的生产计划。
