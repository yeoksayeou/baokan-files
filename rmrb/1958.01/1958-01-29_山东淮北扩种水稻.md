    Shandong Huaibei Expands Rice Planting
    (This article) reports that Shandong Province will increase its rice planting area to 2 million mu this year. This is one of the important measures to realize the national agricultural development program targets ahead of schedule, greatly increase the planting of high-yield crops, and actively reform the farming system.
    Last year, 38 counties in the province trial-planted rice on a total of 139,400 mu. Among them, Licheng County achieved a unit area yield of 443 jin per mu. Guangbei Farm trial-planted rice on saline-alkali land, with an average yield of 513 jin per mu. If annual wheat-rice rotation is realized, the yield per mu can be increased by two to three times compared with dry land crops.
    Shandong Province has decided to vigorously develop this high-yield crop in areas with lakes, depressions, saline-alkali land, and good water sources. In this way, it can fundamentally transform low-yield saline-alkali depressions and produce more grain. To strengthen the leadership of this work, the Shandong Provincial People's Committee has organized more than 200 representatives attending the rice production conference to visit Jiangsu, Anhui, Hebei and other provinces to learn from their experience in planting rice.
    Xinhua News Agency reported that Anhui Province plans to convert more than 5 million mu of land in the Huaibei area to rice cultivation this year, six times more than last year. In order to strengthen the leadership of the conversion to rice cultivation, the Bengbu and Fuyang Prefectural Committees of the Communist Party of China studied the relevant situation as early as October last year and made proper arrangements. At present, agricultural cooperatives are rushing to build dikes in paddy fields. Several counties in Fuyang Prefecture have built more than 600,000 mu of new dikes and repaired more than 270,000 mu of old dikes.
    In the process of converting to rice cultivation, Huaibei attaches particular importance to solving the problem of livestock power. Counties sent a large number of cadres in October last year to purchase livestock separately. At present, six counties including Funan and Linquan have purchased 2,696 yellow cattle and 277 water buffalo from other places.

### 山东淮北扩种水稻

    山东淮北扩种水稻
    本报讯　山东省今年将增加水稻种植面积到二百万亩。这是作为提前实现全国农业发展纲要指标，大量增种高产作物，积极改革耕作制度的重要措施之一。
    去年全省有三十八个县试种水稻共十三万九千四百亩。其中历城县单位面积产量已达亩产四百四十三斤。广北农场在盐碱地上试种水稻，平均亩产五百一十三斤。如果实现每年麦稻轮作，亩产比旱田作物就可增加二、三倍。
    山东省决定把这种高产作物在滨湖、涝洼、盐碱地和水源较好的地区大力发展起来，这样，既可从根本上改造低产的盐碱洼地，又能多打粮食。为了加强这一工作的领导，山东省人民委员会现组织出席水稻生产会议的二百多名代表，前往江苏、安徽、河北等省参观学习种植水稻的经验。
    据新华社讯　今年安徽省淮北地区计划改种水稻五百多万亩，比去年扩大六倍。为了加强对改种水稻工作的领导，中共蚌埠、阜阳两个地委，早在去年10月就研究了有关情况，作了妥善布置。目前各农业社正突击进行稻田打埂工作，阜阳专区几个县已打新埂六十多万亩，整理旧埂二十七万多亩。
    淮北各地在改种水稻工作中，对解决畜力问题特别重视，各县在去年10月份就派出大批干部，分头外出采购。现在，阜南、临泉等六个县已从外地买进黄牛二千六百九十六头，水牛二百七十七头。
