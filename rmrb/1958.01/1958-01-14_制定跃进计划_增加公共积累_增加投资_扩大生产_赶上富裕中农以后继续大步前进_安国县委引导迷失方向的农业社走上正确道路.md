Xinhua News Agency, Baoding Telegram: Xinhua News Agency reporters Zhang Hua, Li Pu, and Jia Wenying report: In Anguo County, Hebei Province, agricultural cooperatives and their members who caught up with or surpassed the income level of local rich middle peasants last year faced a new question of how to continue moving forward. Thanks to the timely understanding of the situation by the Anguo County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the dispatch of a large number of cadres to help these agricultural cooperatives increase public accumulation, increase investment, and expand production, this problem has been resolved.

Anguo County's per-mu yield of grain and cotton last year exceeded the targets set in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). After the autumn harvest distribution, a total of 85 cooperatives and 30,770 cooperative members, who surpassed the income level of local rich middle peasants, accounted for 50% and 57% of the total number of cooperatives and households in the county, respectively. According to the post-autumn harvest distribution figures of 172 cooperatives in the county, their total income from agriculture and sideline occupations was more than 26.5 million yuan. After deducting agricultural taxes, overdue loans, and the living expenses of 250,000 rural people (calculated according to the living standards of rich middle peasants), these cooperatives still had a surplus of about 5 million yuan. Among them, the 85 cooperatives that caught up with or exceeded the income level of rich middle peasants had an average surplus of 10 to 60 yuan per person after deducting living expenses. Some cooperative members with more labor power had enough income in one year to cover two years of consumption.

After these cooperatives caught up with or surpassed the income level of rich middle peasants, some cooperative members and cadres developed some erroneous ideas. First, they were satisfied with the existing income level and were not actively increasing accumulation, expanding production, or increasing income. According to investigations, the production expenses and public accumulation funds retained by cooperatives throughout the county in the initial stage of distribution were generally less than 20% of the total income. Xin'an Township had a grain yield of more than 600 jin per mu last year, with an average income of more than 120 yuan per person, but the retained portion of the cooperatives in this township (including agricultural taxes and state loans) accounted for only 22% of the total income. When the higher-level Party organization suggested that the township increase accumulation and expand production, the Party Secretary of the township actually said that there was no use in retaining more. Second, they wanted to improve the lives of cooperative members too hastily. One agricultural cooperative did not have very high production and income, but during the distribution, some cooperative cadres mistakenly emphasized that the living standards of cooperative members were low, and insisted that the living standards of cooperative members should be on par with those of cooperatives with higher production income. Third, they engaged in extravagance and waste, consuming funds. After the autumn harvest, agricultural cooperatives in Liugezhuang, Wurenqiao, and other townships purchased radios, amplifiers, bicycles, pocket watches, and other items that were not urgently needed at the time. Some cooperatives even spent more than 2,000 yuan to build offices and clubs, and more than 200 yuan to buy copper drums and trumpets, emphasizing ostentation and extravagance. Fourth, cooperative members had nowhere to spend their surplus money, so they used it to build houses and increase daily consumption. Twenty brick kilns burned more than 6 million bricks last winter, and they were all ordered by cooperative members before they were even finished. Last autumn, the county's sales of cigarettes more than doubled compared to the same period last year.

After understanding and analyzing these situations, the Anguo County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that the root cause of these problems after the autumn harvest was that these agricultural cooperatives had lost their direction for continued progress after catching up with or surpassing the income level of rich middle peasants. Based on this, the County Party Committee took the following measures: 1. Timely propose the production increase targets for 1958 to guide farmers to continue moving forward. In October of last year, the County Party Committee formulated a leap forward plan to continue to increase the county's grain and cotton yields by about 30% based on the existing per-mu yields of 464 jin and 50 jin, respectively, and convened a conference of activists in water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation attended by more than 2,000 people from the county to convey and deploy the plan; then, it mobilized cadres and cooperative members of various townships and cooperatives to discuss it in conjunction with the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), democratically formulate the 1958 production leap forward plan, and pointed out the direction for continued struggle for the farmers of the county. 2. Timely propose an investment plan to concentrate surplus money on expanding production. The County Party Committee timely proposed an investment plan of more than 6 million yuan to increase the number of machine wells by more than 600, purchase more than 600 locomobile pumps, add 15,000 rubber-wheeled carts and more than 6,000 draught animals, etc. In order to expand production, various cooperatives also revised the 1957 distribution plan several times, increasing the proportion of retained funds from about 30% of the total income to 40%. 3. Democratically summarize the achievements of the bumper harvest and help agricultural cooperative cadres and cooperative members overcome the conservative ideas of production reaching its peak and living standards reaching their peak. In November of last year, the County Party Committee democratically summarized the county's 1957 production increase experience at a conference of township and cooperative cadres above the level of production team leader, and publicly rewarded more than 500 production increase model townships, cooperatives, teams, and cadres. After the meeting, the Party organizations of various townships and cooperatives led cooperative members to summarize production increase experience and launched a debate on how to continue moving forward. 4. The County Party Committee recently transferred 40 key members from county-level organs at the level of the former district Party committee to work in townships and cooperatives to lead the production leap forward with revolutionary spirit. In this way, each township has an average of five or six leading key members at the level of the former district Party secretary and district head, and each village has one or more resident cadres.

After taking these measures, the production outlook of the county has rapidly changed. At present, more than 110,000 laborers in the county (including more than 10,000 auxiliary laborers) have participated in well-drilling, irrigation, and fertilizer accumulation work. More than 280 machine well frames have been erected throughout the county for winter construction. More than a dozen small plain reservoirs of about 100 mu each have been completed. In order to supplement the shortage of tractors, farmers throughout the county used hoes to deep-plow more than 150,000 mu of cultivated land to a depth of more than one chi. More than 10,000 new pig pens and thousands of toilets have been built throughout the county, and nine cartloads of fertilizer per mu have been accumulated for more than 500,000 mu of cultivated land. In order to prevent spring drought, unprecedented winter irrigation activities are still underway, and half of the spring fallow land has been irrigated. Winter wheat management is also being carried out very well. 180,000 mu of wheat have been universally irrigated with frozen water twice, and coarse fertilizer has been applied to help maintain temperature, and some have also been irrigated with urine fertilizer.

    制定跃进计划　增加公共积累　增加投资　扩大生产
    赶上富裕中农以后继续大步前进
    安国县委引导迷失方向的农业社走上正确道路
    新华社保定电　新华社记者张华、李朴、贾文英报道：河北省安国县去年赶上或超过当地富裕中农收入水平的农业社和社员，曾产生了一个怎样继续前进的新问题。由于中共安国县委及时了解，并派出大批干部帮助这些农业社增加公共积累，增加投资，扩大生产，这个问题已经得到解决。
    安国县去年的粮食棉花亩产量都超过了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的指标。秋收决分后，超过当地富裕中农收入水平的共有八十五个社、三万零七百七十户社员，这些社和户分别占全县社、户总数的50％和57％。据全县一百七十二个社秋收后决分数字估算，他们的农副业总收入有二千六百五十多万元，除扣除农业税、到期贷款和二十五万农村人口的生活消费（以富裕中农生活标准计算）后，这些社的收入还积余五百万元左右。其中八十五个赶上或超过富裕中农收入水平的社，除去生活消费外，平均每人余款十元到六十元。部分劳力多的社员，一年的收入可以够两年消费。
    这些社赶上或超过富裕中农收入水平后，部分社员和干部曾经产生如下的一些错误思想。一是满足于现有的收入水平，不积极增加积累，扩大生产，增加收入。据调查，全县各社在分配初期扣留的生产费用和公积金，一般都不到总收入的20％。辛安乡去年粮食亩产六百斤以上，每人平均收入一百二十多元，但这个乡各社的扣留部分（包括农业税和国家贷款在内）才只占总收入的22％，上级党组织建议这乡增加积累扩大生产时，乡的党委书记竟说扣多了也没用处。二是想过急地改善社员生活。有一个农业社生产和收入并不太高，但是在分配时，有些社干部也错误地强调社员生活水平低，硬要求社员生活水平向生产收入较高的社看齐。三是铺张浪费，消耗资金。流各庄、伍仁桥等乡的农业社在秋收后，曾购买收音机扩大器、自行车、马蹄表等目前并不急需的用具，有的社甚至花二千多元盖办公室和俱乐部，花二百多元买铜鼓洋号，讲排场讲阔绰。四是社员余钱没处花，便用来修建房屋和增加日用消费。二十座砖窑去年冬季烧砖六百多万块，还没等烧好就被社员订购光。去年秋季全县纸烟销售量比前年同期增加了一倍多。
    中共安国县委了解并分析了这些情况以后，认为秋收后发生这些问题的根本原因，是这些农业社赶上或超过富裕中农的收入水平后迷失了继续前进的方向。据此，县委采取了如下的措施。一、及时提出1958年增产指标，引导农民继续前进。中共县委在去年10月份就订出了全县粮食、棉花在亩产四百六十四斤、五十斤的基础上继续提高30％左右的跃进计划，并召集了全县有二千多人参加的水利积肥积极分子大会传达布置；然后发动各乡社干部社员结合全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）加以讨论，民主制订1958年的生产跃进计划，给全县农民指出了继续奋斗的方向。二、及时提出投资计划，把余钱集中到扩大生产上来。县委及时提出了增打六百多眼机井、增购六百多台锅驼机、添置一万五千辆胶皮轮车和六千多头耕畜等的六百多万元的投资计划。各社为了扩大生产，也三番五次地修订了1957年的分配计划，将扣留的比例，由原来占总收入的30％左右增加到了40％。三、民主总结丰收成绩，帮助农业社干部和社员克服生产到顶和生活到顶的保守思想。去年11月份，县委在全县生产队长以上乡社干部的大会上，民主总结了全县1957年的增产经验，并且当众奖励了五百多个增产模范乡、社、队和干部。会后，各乡、社的党组织又领导社员总结增产经验，展开了如何继续前进的辩论。四、县委在最近又从县级机关中抽调了四十名相当区委级的骨干分配到乡、社去工作，以革命精神来领导生产再跃进。这样，每个乡平均就有五、六个相当区委书记和区长级的领导骨干，每个村都有一个以上的常驻干部。
    采取这些措施以后，全县生产面貌迅速改观。目前，全县已有十一万多名劳力（包括一万多名辅助劳力）参加了打井浇地积肥工作。全县搭起了二百八十多个机井架，进行冬季施工。全县十几处百亩左右的平地水库已经全部完成。为了补助拖拉机不足，全县农民用镐头将十五万亩耕地深耕了一尺多。全县新搭了一万多个猪圈、几千个厕所，并为五十多万亩耕地每亩积出了九车肥料。为了预防春旱，破天荒的冬灌活动仍在进行着，有半数的春白地已经灌过了水。小麦越冬管理搞得也很好，十八万亩小麦普遍浇了两次冻水，并且施上了粗肥助温，有的还浇上了尿肥。
