Building Mountainous Areas into Socialist Paradises

    The Footsteps of Socialism
    —A Visit to the Mountainous Area of Lin County, Part One
    By our correspondent Yao Liwen

    I had been in school for more than two years, and it had been a long time since I went to the countryside. Recently, I took a trip to the mountainous area of Lin County, Henan Province, and everything I saw and heard was so fresh. I had a feeling of "seven days in the mountains is like a thousand years in the world."

    I am not too unfamiliar with the peasants. In those difficult years, I shared weal and woe with them. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Land Reform, I spent many unforgettable days and nights with them. Today, when I see with my own eyes that they have removed the "two big mountains" from their shoulders and are transforming nature, arranging rivers and mountains, and building their beautiful lives with the spirit of masters of nature, when I see with my own eyes that they are advancing rapidly on the broad road of socialism, I cannot restrain the excitement in my heart again and again.

    Water and Mountainous Areas

    Let's start with "water."

    Those who are not familiar with the mountainous areas may not easily understand the relationship between water and the peasants in mountainous areas. Take washing one's face as an example. People in Sichuan and urban residents would not think that there would be any difficulty in this. However, in some mountain villages, a family often uses only one basin of water to wash their faces. After the elderly wash, the young people wash. After a few people have washed in one basin of water, they even put it aside, reluctant to pour it away, and let it settle so that it can be used for other purposes. Out of the 555 administrative villages and 537,000 people in Lin County, 307 villages and 280,000 people had difficulty getting drinking water. They had to travel over mountains and ridges all year round to fetch water from afar. The nearest was three to five li, and the farthest was more than ten li. About sixty years ago, a tragic incident occurred in Sang'erzhuang Village in the northeast of Lin County: On New Year's Eve, an old man named Sang from Dongjie went to Huangyaling, seven or eight li away, to fetch a load of water; his daughter-in-law went to the village to replace him, but accidentally spilled both buckets of water. The more the daughter-in-law thought about how sorry she was for the old man, and the more she thought about not being able to drink sweet water on the first day of the New Year, she went home and hanged herself. ... Here, the villages that have convenient access to water are more likely for young men to find wives; some villages have particularly difficult access to water, and there are particularly many bachelors in this village. In many mountain villages in Lin County, there is a folk song: "We look forward to the stars, we look forward to the moon, when will we see the water flow into our village?"

    People both look forward to water and fear water. Lin County is located at the eastern foot of the Taihang Mountains, surrounded by mountains and valleys. The mountains are high and the slopes are steep, and the rainfall is concentrated. According to experts, the average annual rainfall is 550 mm, most of which is concentrated in the flood season, and the rainfall in July and August accounts for more than 70% of the annual rainfall. Moreover, due to the ruthless exploitation of the broad masses of poor peasants by the rulers of the past, they were often forced to open up wasteland on steep slopes; in addition, indiscriminate felling of trees and disrepair of terraced fields led to serious soil erosion throughout the county. Once there was heavy rain, mountain floods broke out, and countless gullies collapsed.

    Soil erosion made the mountain slopes barren, the climate unbalanced, and the area was subject to attacks from drought, flood, hail, wind, and frost every year. In the great drought of 1943, there was no harvest in all four seasons, and more than 10,000 farming households in the county fled to other places to escape the famine.

    A folk song vividly reflects the face of old Lin County: "Old Lin County, what a pity, bare hillsides and dry riverbeds, rain washes away the grain, no rain and no seeds seen."

    This folk song, while expressing the suffering of the peasants in mountainous areas, also shows how weak and powerless individual peasants are in the face of nature!

    The Footsteps of Socialism

    After the peasants of Lin County mounted the socialist steed, the face of the mountainous area has changed dramatically in just a few years.

    Not only has the problem of drinking water for the people of the whole county been solved, but the problem of water use for most of the land is also being solved. The peasants of Lin County are no longer slaves to nature, but masters who rearrange the rivers and mountains according to their own interests. In the past few years, through thousands of people with thousands of hoes, tens of thousands of people with tens of thousands of shovels, one hammer and one drill, one hoe and one shovel, opening mountains and splitting rocks, tunneling through mountains, they have cut off 55 branches of the Taihang Mountains, crossed more than 200 deep ravines, and built nine large canal projects with a total length of 226 li and hundreds of small canals. They have begun to tame the fierce and roaring Qi River (the largest river in Lin County), and are transforming the irritable nature of the three larger rivers, Zhang, Huan, and Xi, so that they flow in the direction designated by the people.

    I am most interested in these four figures:

    From "Yu the Great controlling the floods" to the liberation of the whole county, for three to four thousand years, Lin County had only 10,000 mu of irrigated land.

    From the liberation of the whole county in 1944 to the winter of 1955, it was eleven years. The liberated peasants, while completing the great tasks of land reform, supporting the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and consolidating the revolutionary base areas, and restoring the wounds of war, expanded the irrigated land by 60,000 mu in eleven years. This is more than five times the amount of irrigated land built in thousands of years.

    In the winter of 1955, Lin County achieved advanced collectivization. From then until the autumn of 1957, in two years, 160,000 mu of irrigated land was expanded. This was the first production upsurge, the first great leap forward. The area of irrigated land expanded in two years was more than twice the total area of irrigated land in the eleven years since liberation. By the winter of 1957, the county already had 237,000 mu of irrigated land.

    Last winter and this spring, it was another "doubling." The canals, reservoirs, mountain springs, and dry wells that have already been started, have been completed, and are about to be completed can expand the irrigated area by a total of 305,800 mu. That is to say, the water conservancy achievements of one winter and spring not only surpassed the two years of the first upsurge, but also exceeded the total water conservancy achievements in history (including the two years of the first upsurge).

    That is to say, in just two and a half years after agricultural cooperativization, by the time of the wheat harvest and autumn planting this year, in Lin County, which was originally full of bare hillsides and dry riverbeds and suffered from drought nine years out of ten, more than half of the county's 980,000 mu of cultivated land has become irrigated land. That is to say, in Lin County, where more than half of the population had difficulty getting drinking water and used water as if it were oil, every person in the county now has an average of one mu of irrigated land.

    These are not ordinary figures, they are shining with the brilliance of socialism. They vividly show that socialism is advancing in great strides over high mountains and rivers. "If it is an iron mountain, we will knock it down half way!"

    I saw more specifically the heroic posture of socialism advancing in great strides in the mountainous areas after visiting the Tianqiao Duan Canal project in Panyang Township.

    Panyang Township is located between the Zhang River and its tributary, the Lushui River. The people living on the ridge watched the Zhang River flowing under their feet, but suffered from drought year after year. Last autumn, when it didn't rain for three months, the peasants of Panyang Township overcame various difficulties to build canals, dig wells, dig mountain springs, drill water holes, carry water on their shoulders, and divert water from canals. Not only did they successfully complete the task of fighting drought and planting wheat, but they also expanded the irrigated area by more than 2,000 mu. People were not satisfied with this. The fight against drought and the planting of wheat made the peasants see their own strength, and they wanted to fundamentally change the face of their hometown and eliminate drought forever. They decided to divert the Zhang River water from the Niutou Mountain west of Tianqiao Duan in the upper reaches of the Zhang River to the high ridge, and build a 40-li long canal that runs across the township and irrigates 6,000 mu of ridge land and terraced fields (accounting for 70% of the township's total cultivated land), realizing the water conservancy of the township ten years ahead of schedule.

    Building the Tianqiao Duan Canal is the ideal of the peasants of Panyang Township for many years. Before liberation, the landlords and gentry used the banner of building the Tianqiao Canal to raise funds and donations from the people. The grain and money were collected, and they invited a few leading figures, set up a few tables of wine and food, ate and drank, and the matter of building the canal was not mentioned again. After liberation, some people also tried to build the Tianqiao Canal, but because at that time every peasant only had one mu or eight fen of land in their eyes, and everyone had their own small calculations: people with less land to benefit were not enthusiastic, those with more land were afraid of working too much, and some people were afraid that the canal would take up their land; in addition, the funds and labor force were insufficient, so the wish to build the Tianqiao Canal was never realized.

    The start of the Tianqiao Canal was a heartening and joyful event. Many people regarded the construction of the Tianqiao Duan Canal as laying the "roots of happiness" for future generations, and wanted to contribute as much as possible to the construction of the canal. Many commune members wrote letters of determination, requesting to go to the dangerous construction site to build the canal; six Party members even bit their fingers and wrote blood letters. The women took on all the tasks in the rear, such as accumulating fertilizer and watering wheat fields, and encouraged the men to go to the mountains to build the canal. They put forward the slogan: "Women have ambition, we want to compare with men, complete the task of accumulating fertilizer early, and strive to go to the Tianqiao Canal again!" The male commune members assured the female commune members: "We are not afraid of difficulties and not afraid of the cold, one determination and one effort, the mountain is hard but the human heart is harder, we will not stop until the water enters the land!" It is said that when the Tianqiao Canal started construction on December 1, Youth League member Lu Erjun contacted more than a dozen young people overnight to form a shock team, and they rushed to the Tianqiao Duan cliff construction site before dawn. Someone said to them: "The Tianqiao Duan cliff is steep and the stone is hard, it is not easy to start." The shock team members replied: "If it is an iron mountain, we will knock it down half way!" One of the shock team members was also a 60-year-old "old youth" Lu Tiankui. He stubbornly insisted on going to the cliff with the shock team. When the young men saw him at Tianqiao Duan, they asked him worriedly: "Tiankui, why are you here too?" He replied very simply: "I heard about building the Tianqiao Canal when I was twenty years old; I have been looking forward to building the canal all my life, why don't you let me participate?" "It's not that we don't want you to participate, old man, you are old, it's cold and windy, we are afraid that your body can't take it!" the young men said. The old man insisted on staying. He said: "What is the difficulty of the wind! I can't beat you in hammering, can't I do something else?" He constantly encouraged the young people at the construction site, and when he rested, he also said fast board: "Don't look at me old, I want to resolutely complete water conservancy! Although people are old, their hearts are not old, wherever there is difficulty, I will go there!" which made everyone laugh happily, and the young people's enthusiasm was even greater.

    I came to Panyang Township in mid-December last year. I walked along the mountain path to Tianqiao Duan. The Zhang River in winter has lost its power in summer, and stretches like a green ribbon at the foot of the mountain. On the ridge, many women and old people were building the canal - this is the rear of the Tianqiao Canal, with more earthwork, which was contracted by women and old men. After walking another five or six li, looking up at the mountainside, there were often patches of white marks on many black boulders - these were the delineated canal lines. In three months, these slopes would be cut off in the middle, so that the Zhang River water would obediently flow from here, flowing to the designated place. The Tianqiao Canal will also be like a giant dragon wrapped around eighteen mountain peaks!

    We climbed a few more ridges, and the mountain was even higher. Looking back, the mountain villages such as Lujiaguai had fallen under our feet. The Tianqiao Duan appeared in front of us. The red cliff was bare, without a single tree. Looking from a distance, there were only three or five clusters of black spots wriggling. If the comrades who were traveling with me hadn't told me, I wouldn't have thought that these were the shock team members.

    I got closer to Tianqiao Duan. This is a straight up and down cliff, almost ninety degrees. The shock team members had already blasted out an uneven path in the middle of the cliff. The wide place was more than a foot wide, and some could only barely open two feet. Several thick ropes were hanging on the cliff, and some shock team members had to rely on them to ensure labor safety.

    This steep cliff is a large red cliff like an iron plate. On an ordinary bluestone cliff, a strong young man can drill five to seven feet in a day; on this red cliff, he can only drill three feet in a day, and at most four feet. A three-foot-deep blasting hole, filled with gunpowder, can only blast away a few face-sized stones. They just blasted this 150-zhang long cliff in the middle with one hammer and one blast, and dug out a four-foot-wide and one-person-high "suspended road" for the canal to pass through.

    I walked to that newly opened cliff path, carefully holding the cracked cliff rock, and approached the shock team members. From time to time, some gravel rolled down, stirring up echoes in the valley and making bursts of rumbling noises. Moving in the middle of the cliff, looking up is the majestic hundred-zhang red cliff, and looking down is the cold and eerie black water deep pool. I tried my best to calm myself down. The first time I stepped on the cliff, I couldn't help but feel a little dizzy and my legs were weak. I leaned against the cliff and settled down. I saw the shock team members stepping on the edge of the cliff, constantly wielding iron hammers with both hands, and tapping the iron chisels inserted into the stone slabs. Their labor was tense and peaceful. From that peaceful look, from that rhythmic labor music, I seemed to hear them saying: "You are hard, you are iron and stone, so what! I will split you open with one hammer after another!" Only at this time did I truly realize the full power of the battle slogan "The mountain is hard but the human heart is harder."

    Before coming to Tianqiao Duan, the comrades in the county had introduced to me that the Tianqiao Canal project was: the canal is 40 li long, passing through a 150-zhang cliff, circling eighteen mountain ridges, and drilling through two stone holes more than four zhang long... Now, I understand what kind of project the Tianqiao Canal project is.

    What is the spirit of the people in mountainous areas conquering nature? There is a poem to prove it - this is a poem by an anonymous poet in Panyang Township:

    "Smoke and dust fly and the sky is dark,
    Rolling stones rush and the river water turns,
    The sound of cannons shakes the cliff down,
    Red flags wave and laughter is loud.
    Hands split the Tianqiao Duan,
    Six thousand mu of land do not depend on the sky!"

    社会主义的脚步
    ——林县山区访问记之一
    本报记者  姚力文
    在学校里住了两年多，好久没有下乡。最近又去河南省林县山区跑了一趟，所见所闻，一切是这样的新鲜。大有“山中方七日，世上几千年”的感觉。
    对于农民，我不算太陌生。在那些艰辛的岁月里，我和他们一起共过患难。抗日战争时代，土地改革时代，我同他们一起度过了多少个可歌可泣的日夜。今天，当我亲眼看到他们搬掉肩上的“两座大山”之后，正以大自然主人翁的气概来改造自然、安排河山、建设自己的美好生活的时候，当我亲眼看到他们在社会主义的康庄大道上快步前进的时候，我一次又一次抑制不住心头的激动。
    水和山区
    先从“水”谈起吧。
    水和山区农民的关系如何，对山区还不够熟悉的人，是不容易理解的。就以洗脸来说吧，对于川地和城市居民来说，不会想到这还会发生什么困难。可是，有些山村，却常常一家人只用一盆水来洗脸，老年人洗罢，年轻人再洗。一盆水洗了几个人，甚至还要放在一边，舍不得泼掉，让它澄清一下，以备他用。林县全县原有五百五十五个行政村、五十三万七千多人，就有三百零七个村、二十八万人吃水困难。他们要常年翻山越岭，远道担水。近的三五里，远的十多里。大约六十年前，林县城东北的桑耳庄村曾发生过这样一件惨事：东街的一个桑姓老汉，大年三十的晚上去七八里外的黄崖岭挑回一担水；儿媳妇到村头去接替他，一不留神把两桶水泼光了。儿媳妇越想越对不住老人家，又想起大年初一吃不上一顿甜水，回家便上吊死了。……在这里，哪个村吃水方便些，哪个村的青年就容易娶上媳妇；有的村吃水特别难，这个村光棍汉就特别多。在林县许多山村里流传着一个民谣：“盼星星，盼月亮，啥时盼的水流到俺庄上。”
    人们既盼水，又怕水。林县位于太行山东麓，四面群山环抱，境内山谷遍野。山高坡陡，雨量集中。据专家调查，平均每年降雨量五百五十公厘，多半集中在汛期，七、八两个月雨量要占到全年降雨量的70％以上。又由于解放前历代统治者的无情压榨，广大贫苦农民常被逼上深山，在陡坡开荒；再加乱伐树木，梯田失修，遂使全县水土流失严重。一遇大雨，山洪暴发，冲沟倒岸，不计其数。
    水土流失，山坡变瘦，气候失调，年年要受到旱、涝、雹、洪、风、冻的袭击。1943年大旱，四季无收，全县有一万多农户外出逃荒。
    一首民谣逼真地反映出旧林县的面貌：“旧林县，真可怜，光秃山坡干河滩，有雨冲的粮不收，没雨旱的籽不见。”
    这民谣固然道出山区农民的苦痛，却也说明了：个体农民在大自然面前是显得多么软弱无力啊！
    社会主义的脚步
    林县农民跨上社会主义的骏马之后，短短数年的时间，山区的面貌就迥然改观了。
    这里不仅已经解决了全县人民吃水的问题，而且正在解决着大部土地用水的问题。林县农民已不再是听命于自然的奴隶，而是依照自身的利益重新安排河山的主人了。几年来，经过千人千把镢，万人万张锨，一锤一钻，一镢一锨，开山劈石，穿山凿洞，已经斩断了太行山五十五道支脉，越过二百多条深沟巨壑，修筑了九道总长达二百二十六里长的较大渠道工程和成百条小渠道，已开始驯服了凶猛咆哮的淇河（林县境内最大河流），正在改造着漳、洹、淅三道较大河流的暴躁性格，使它流向人们给它指定的道路。
    引起我最大兴趣的是这四个数字：
    从“大禹王治水”到全县解放前，三四千年的时间，全林县只有一万亩水浇地。
    从1944年全县解放，到1955年冬季以前，是十一年的时间。解放了的农民，在完成土地改革、支援抗日战争、解放战争、巩固革命根据地等伟大任务和恢复战争创伤的同时，十一年扩大水浇地六万亩。超过几千年所修水地的五倍。
    1955年冬，林县实现了高级合作化。从那时候起到1957年秋天，两年的时间，扩大水地十六万亩。这是第一个生产高潮，第一个大跃进。两年扩大水地面积比解放以来十一年水地总面积的两倍还多。到1957年冬前，全县已有水地二十三万七千亩了。
    去冬和今春，又是“翻一翻”。现在已经动工的、已经完成的和就要完成的水渠、水库、山泉、旱井，共计可扩大水浇地面积三十万五千八百亩。这就是说，一个冬春的水利成就，不仅赛过了第一次高潮中的两年，而且比有史以来水利总成绩（包括第一次高潮中的两年在内）还要多一些。
    这就是说，在农业合作化之后，仅仅两年半的时间，到今年麦收秋种时节，本来到处是光秃山坡干河滩、十年九遭旱的林县，全县九十八万亩耕地中，有半数以上变成水地。这就是说，本来半数以上人口吃水都很困难、用水如用油的林县，全县每一口人平均有一亩水浇地了。
    这不是普通的数字，它们闪烁着社会主义的光辉。它们生动地显示出来：社会主义正迈着大步跨过高山大河前进。“是铁山，也要撞它半个边！”
    我更具体地看到社会主义在山区大步前进的雄姿，是在参观了盘阳乡的天桥断渠工程之后。
    盘阳乡位于漳河和它的支流露水河之间。住在岭上的人们，眼看着漳河水在自己脚下滚滚流去，却连年遭受旱灾。去年秋天，三个月没落雨，盘阳乡农民克服种种困难，修渠、打井、挖山泉、钻水洞、肩担水、渠引水，不仅胜利完成了抗旱种麦任务，还扩大了二千多亩水浇地。人们没有就此满足。抗旱种麦使农民们看到自身的力量，他们要从根本上改变家乡面貌，永除旱灾。他们决心从漳河上游天桥断以西的牛头山上，把漳河水引上高岭，修一条四十里长渠，横贯全乡，遍浇六千亩岭地、梯田（占全乡耕地总数的70％），提前十年实现全乡水利化。
    修天桥断渠是盘阳乡农民多年来的理想。解放前，地主绅士们曾打着修天桥渠的招牌，让人们集资捐款，粮款聚起来了，他们请上几个头面人物，摆上几桌酒席，吃喝一顿，修渠的事也就不提了。解放后，也曾有人筹谋修天桥渠，只因为那时候每个农民眼睛里只有自己的那一亩八分地，一个人心里一个小算盘：受益地少的人不热心，地多的又怕出工太多，还有人怕渠道占了自己的地；再加上资金、劳力都感不足，修天桥渠的愿望也一直未能实现。
    天桥渠的动工是振奋人心的大喜事。许多人都把修天桥断渠看成为子孙万代扎下“幸福根”，都想为修渠尽多地贡献出一份力量。许多社员写下决心书，要求到险恶工地修渠；还有六个党员咬破手指，写了血书。妇女们把后方的积肥、浇麦田等任务全部担起来，鼓励男人们上山去修渠。她们提出口号：“妇女们有志气，要和男人比一比，积肥任务早完成，争取再上天桥渠！”男社员们向女社员们保证：“不怕困难不怕冻，一个决心一股劲，山硬没有人心硬，水不进地不收兵！”听说12月1日天桥渠开工，青年团员卢二俊连夜串连了十几个青年组成突击队，一日天不明，他们就赶到了天桥断悬崖工地。有人对他们说：“天桥断崖陡石硬，不好动手。”突击队员们回答：“是铁山，也要撞它半个边！”参加突击队的还有一个六十多岁的“老青年”卢天魁。他执拗地要随突击队一齐去悬崖。小伙子们在天桥断看到他，担心地问他：“天魁爷，你怎么也来啦？”他回答的很干脆：“我二十岁，就听说要修天桥渠；我盼了一辈子了，才盼到修渠，你为啥不让我参加？”“不是不让你老人家参加，你年纪大了，天冷风大，怕你的身体吃不住！”小伙子们说。老汉还是执意留下。他说：“刮风算啥困难！打锤赛不过你们，我还不能做点别的吗？”他在工地上不断鼓励青年人，休息的时候还说快板：“别看我年纪大，我要坚决完成水利化！虽说人老心不老，那里困难我那里去搞！”逗得大伙乐和和的，年轻人的干劲也更大了。
    我是去年12月中旬来到盘阳乡的。沿着傍山小道向天桥断走去。冬日的漳河已失去了夏天的威风，像一条绿带子伸展在山脚下。在山岭上，不少妇女和老人们在修渠——这是天桥渠的后方，土方工程多些，由妇女、老汉们包修。再前行五六里，仰望山腰，不少黑色巨石上常有块块白色标记——这是划定的渠线，三个月后，这些山坡都将被拦腰切断，让漳河水顺从地从这儿流过，流向指定的去处。天桥渠还要像一条巨龙一样腰缠十八个山头呢！
    我们又爬了几道岭，山势更高。回头看，卢家拐等山村已落在我们的脚下了。天桥断出现在我们面前。光秃秃的红崖，没有一棵树。远远望去，只有三五一簇的黑色斑点在蠕动。不是同行的同志告诉我，我一时还没想到这就是那些突击队员。
    走近了天桥断。这里是直上直下，几近九十度的悬崖。突击队员们已在悬崖腰间炸出一条参差不齐的小道。宽的地方有尺多宽，有的还只能勉强放开两只脚。悬崖上挂着几根大粗绳，有的突击队员得靠它来保证劳动安全。
    这立陡的悬崖是一块铁板似的大红崖。在一般青石崖上打炮眼，一个强壮的小伙子，一天可钻进五尺到七尺；在这红崖石上，一天却只能钻进三尺，多者四尺。三尺深炮眼，装上满满的火药，一炮也只能炸飞几块脸盆大的石头。他们就这样一锤一炮地，硬是拦腰炸断这长达一百五十丈的绝壁，挖出一条四尺宽、一人多高的“悬空路”，让渠道从这儿通过。
    我走到那新辟的绝壁小路上，小心地扶着那炸裂的崖石，走近突击队员们。不时有一些碎石滚下，激起山谷回声，发出阵阵轰隆巨响。移动在绝壁腰间，上看是威风凛凛的百丈红崖，下看是寒气森森的黑水深潭。我尽力使自己镇静，初踏悬崖，仍禁不住有点眼发晕、腿发软。我身靠悬崖安定下来。我看到突击队员们足踏悬崖边，双手不停地抡着铁锤，插入石板中的铁钎，点点打进。他们的劳动是紧张的，又是那样的安详。从那安详的神态里，从那有节凑的劳动乐曲里，我好像听到他们在说：“你硬，你是铁石，又有什么了不起！我一锤又一锤，总会把你劈开的！”这时，也只有这时，我才真正体会到“山硬没有人心硬”这句战斗口号的全部力量。
    在未来天桥断以前，县里同志曾向我介绍天桥渠工程是：渠长四十里，穿过一百五十丈悬崖绝壁，盘抹十八个山岭，钻透两个四丈多长的石洞……。现在，我才理解到天桥渠工程是怎样的工程了。
    山区人民征服自然的气概究竟如何？有诗为证——这是盘阳乡一个无名诗人的诗句：
    “烟尘飞扬天昏暗，
    滚石奔飞河水翻，
    炮声威震悬崖倒，
    红旗招展笑声欢。
    双手劈开天桥断，
    六千亩地不靠天！”
