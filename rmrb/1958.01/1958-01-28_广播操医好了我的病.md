    Radio Calisthenics Cured My Illness
    Lin Fuxiang
    I am a newspaper and magazine vendor, forty-three years old this year, in good health and full of energy. I run around every day, covering dozens of miles, promoting newspapers and magazines to everyone, and I don't feel tired at all.
    The reason I am still able to work so easily and happily is because radio calisthenics cured my arm.
    I have always been selling newspapers and magazines, always carrying the newspapers and magazines with my left hand and selling them with my right. As time went on, the arm that always held the newspapers and magazines lacked activity, and later it became a little inflexible. At that time, I didn't think it was a big deal, thinking it would get better in a few days. Who knew it would only get worse and worse, my left arm gradually became numb, it was very difficult to move, and sometimes it hurt a lot when I moved. This made me very anxious, so I hurried to the hospital to see a doctor. However, after five or six months of treatment, it didn't get better.
    Later, the doctor at the hospital told me that my arm numbness was caused by a long-term lack of activity, stiff blood vessels, and poor blood circulation. Taking medicine and injections can certainly help to promote blood circulation and relax the muscles, but more importantly, I should massage more and move more, and it would be even better to participate in some light physical activities. This will accelerate blood circulation in the arm and loosen the muscles and bones, so that the arm will get better. At that time, because there were no other treatment methods, and I had heard that some people had indeed cured their illnesses by doing some physical activities, I followed the doctor's advice and tried it. I am old and cannot do other physical activities, so I chose radio calisthenics. At first, I couldn't do many of the movements, so I had to run and jump lightly on the ground, bending my body back and forth, left and right, and doing some light arm movements. I moved every day like this, plus massage. After a period of time, my left arm was indeed more flexible than before. This made me very happy. After that, I insisted on doing radio calisthenics every day. My left arm went from not being able to lift up to being able to lift forward and sideways, and later it was able to lift upwards. For two years, I have never stopped doing the exercises. Getting up early in the morning, the first thing I do is exercise, and I do it again before going to bed at night. After insisting on it for two years, my left arm completely regained its mobility. Last October, the State Sports Commission announced the third set of radio calisthenics, and I quickly learned it. Now I do the third set of radio calisthenics every day. Although I am doing the same work as before, I am no longer worried about my left arm becoming numb.

    广播操医好了我的病
    林福祥
    我是一个报刊推销员，今年四十三岁了，身体很健康，精神很饱满。每天奔来走去，赶上几十里路，向大家推销报刊，一点也不觉得累。
    我所以现在还能够这样轻松愉快地工作，是因为广播体操医好了我的手臂的缘故。
    我一直做推售报刊工作，每天总是左手挟着报刊，右手分卖。日子一长，那只老挟着报刊的手臂就缺乏活动，到后来显得有点举动不灵了。那时候，我觉得这没什么，过几天就会好的。谁知竟越弄越不好，左手臂渐渐地麻痹了，举动很费劲，有时一动还很痛。这下把我急坏了，赶紧到医院去看。但是，经过了五、六个月的治疗不见好转。
    后来，医院的大夫对我说，我的手臂麻痹是由于长期缺乏活动，血管僵化血液不通造成的，吃药打针当然可以辅助活血舒筋，但更重要的应该多多按摩，多多活动，能参加一些轻微的体育活动更好，这样会使手臂加速血液循环，松动筋骨，那样手臂才会好的。当时，因为没有其他治疗方法，也听说过有的人确是常作些体育活动就把病治好了，我就按着大夫所说的去试验了。我年纪大，不能作其他体育活动，就选择了广播体操。起初，好多动作我做不来，只好在地上轻轻地跑一跑，跳一跳，身体作前后左右弯屈，手臂作一些轻微活动。就这样每天都活动，再加上按摩，过一个时期，我的左手臂果然比以前灵活了。这使我非常高兴。以后我就每天坚持作广播体操，我的左手臂由不能抬举到能够前平举、侧平举，后来又能够上举了。两年来，我从来没有间断过作操。清早起来，第一件事就是作操，晚上睡觉前再做一次。一直坚持了两年，我的左手臂完全恢复了活动能力。去年10月国家体委公布了第三套广播体操，我很快就学会了，现在我天天作着第三套广播体操。虽然我还做着和以前一样的工作，但是再也不耽心我的左手臂麻痹了。
