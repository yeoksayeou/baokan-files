　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 14th: TASS reported from Moscow on January 14th: The Soviet government and the Ghanaian government have formally reached an agreement on establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries and exchanging diplomatic representatives at the ambassadorial level at an appropriate time. The two governments believe that this step will help develop international cooperation and thus help maintain and consolidate world peace.

　　In March last year, B. Giktov, head of the Soviet government delegation attending Ghana's independence ceremony, held talks with Ghanaian Prime Minister Nkrumah and reached an informal agreement on establishing diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Ghana. Subsequently, Ghana's Acting High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, John Kuntuah, and the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Malik, also held formal talks on relations between the two countries.
