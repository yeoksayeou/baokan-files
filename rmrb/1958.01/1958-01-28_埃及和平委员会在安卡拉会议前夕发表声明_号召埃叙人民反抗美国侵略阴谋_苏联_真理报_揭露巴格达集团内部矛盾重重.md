　　Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency, Arab public opinion continues to condemn the United States' attempt to use the Baghdad Pact to promote its policy of aggression in the Middle East.

　　The Egyptian National Peace Council issued a statement on the 26th, saying that Dulles's participation in the Baghdad Treaty Council meeting "heralds a signal of further dangerous conspiracies." The Ankara meeting "is a warning that the United States and its allies are determined to implement their policies of aggression and sabotage."

　　The statement pointed out that one of the goals of the Baghdad Treaty Ankara meeting is to overthrow the nationalist governments of Egypt and Syria.

　　The statement finally called on the people of Egypt and Syria to be vigilant and unite to resist all conspiracies.

　　Damascus's "Al-Jamahir" newspaper published a speech by Shukair, leader of the Jordanian National Front, on the 26th. Shukair said, "American imperialism is also trying to link the Baghdad Treaty countries with its own policies and turn them into missile bases." He said, "U.S. Army Chief of Staff Taylor's recent visits to Tehran and Ankara are to achieve this goal."

　　He believes that Dulles's visit to Ankara is to encourage the rulers of the Baghdad Treaty countries to accept the war plan that the United States has already formulated. He said, "I believe that the result of the Baghdad Treaty meeting will be the planning of new conspiracies against the two free Arab countries - Syria and Egypt."

　　On the same day, "Al-Nasr" also pointed out in an editorial that Dulles will use the so-called "Soviet threat" as an excuse to demand the establishment of missile bases on the territories of Turkey, Iran, and Iraq.

　　According to Moscow news: "Pravda" commented on the contradictions between the member states of the Baghdad Pact on the 27th.

　　The article said that the Arab public is watching with deep unease the conspiracies of American imperialism in the Near and Middle East aimed at intensifying war preparations and strengthening the Baghdad Pact. In recent days, many prominent political activists in Arab countries have published public statements in newspapers condemning the policies of the United States. Protest movements have also been launched in countries where the ruling groups completely follow the aggressive policies of colonial countries.

　　"Pravda" pointed out that increasingly loud calls are being made in the Jordanian parliament demanding that Jordan not participate in aggressive blocs and strengthen friendship with Syria and Egypt. The Lebanese public condemned the participation of the country's military delegation in the Ankara meeting. Supporters of the Baghdad Pact in Iraq are encountering great difficulties, even though a military regime has been established in the country.

　　"Pravda" finally wrote that the Iranian government is also not in a hurry to agree to the United States' demand to deploy rocket weapons among the member states of the Baghdad Pact. On the eve of the opening of the Baghdad Treaty Council's Ankara meeting, the contradictions between the participants in the treaty have already been exposed, and even Western propaganda agencies cannot hide this.

    埃及和平委员会在安卡拉会议前夕发表声明
    号召埃叙人民反抗美国侵略阴谋
    苏联“真理报”揭露巴格达集团内部矛盾重重
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：阿拉伯国家公众和舆论继续谴责美国企图利用巴格达集团推行侵略中东的政策。
    埃及全国拥护和平委员会26日发表的一项声明说，杜勒斯参加巴格达条约理事会会议这件事，“预示着要有进一步危险阴谋的信号”。安卡拉会议“是一种预告，说明美国和它的盟国决心要实行它们的侵略和破坏政策”。
    声明指出，巴格达条约安卡拉会议的一个目标是要推翻埃及和叙利亚的民族主义政府。
    声明最后号召埃及和叙利亚人民提高警惕，并且团结起来反抗一切阴谋。
    大马士革“群众报”26日刊载了约旦全国阵线领袖舒凯尔的谈话。舒凯尔说，“美帝国主义也在试图把巴格达条约国家同它自己的政策联系起来，把它们变成导弹基地”。他说，“美国陆军参谋长泰勒最近访问德黑兰和安卡拉就是为了达到这个目的”。
    他认为，杜勒斯访问安卡拉就是为了怂恿巴格达条约国家的统治者们接受美国已经拟订好的战争计划。他说，“我相信，巴格达条约会议的结果将是策划好对两个阿拉伯自由国家——叙利亚和埃及的新阴谋”。
    同一天，“胜利报”也在社论中指出，杜勒斯将借口所谓“苏联威胁”，要求在土耳其、伊朗和伊拉克的国土上建立导弹基地。
    另据莫斯科消息：“真理报”27日评论巴格达条约成员国之间的矛盾。
    文章说，阿拉伯各国公众怀着深切的不安注视着美帝国主义在中近东旨在加紧备战、加强巴格达条约的阴谋。这些天来，阿拉伯国家的许多著名政治活动家纷纷在报纸上发表公开声明，谴责美国的政策。抗议运动在那些统治集团完全追随殖民国家的侵略政策的国家里也开展起来了。
    “真理报”指出，约旦议会中日益响亮地传出要求约旦不要参加侵略集团和加强同叙利亚、埃及的友好的呼声。黎巴嫩公众谴责这个国家的军事代表团参加安卡拉会议。伊拉克的巴格达条约的支持者们遇到很大困难，虽然在这个国家里已经建立了军事统治制度。
    “真理报”最后写道，伊朗政府也并不急于同意美国在巴格达集团成员国中设置火箭武器的要求。在巴格达条约理事会安卡拉会议开幕前夕，这个条约参加国之间的矛盾就已经暴露出来了，连西方的宣传机关都无法隐讳这一点。
