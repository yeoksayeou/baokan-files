Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Hebei Province had ten agricultural cooperatives last year that created a yield of two thousand jin per mu of grain on a total of 28.48 mu of land. The land where the cooperatives achieved double-thousand jin yields ranged from one mu to 8.33 mu; included both paddy fields and dry land; and encompassed plains and hillsides. The specific figures for the double-thousand jin yields in each cooperative ranged from a minimum of 2,010-odd jin to a maximum of 2,200-odd jin. These cooperatives are: Junying Agricultural Cooperative and Mengjiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Xingtai County; Jiao Zuo Agricultural Cooperative in Jize County; May First Agricultural Cooperative in Ruzuo Township, Yongnian County; Chengang Victory Agricultural Cooperative in Wei County; Red Star Agricultural Cooperative and Chengguan Red Light Agricultural Cooperative in Sanhuangmiao, Linzhang County; Xishiling Agricultural Cooperative in Shahe County; Shahe Village Agricultural Cooperative and Youai Agricultural Cooperative in Xishu Township, She County.

In addition, nine agricultural cooperatives in Hebei achieved a grain yield of one thousand jin per mu for the entire cooperative last year. These cooperatives are: Nanyuan, Dongnanjiao, Nantoucun, Fengjiazhuang, and Lujiayuan Agricultural Cooperatives in Xingtai City; Huamu and Liangou Agricultural Cooperatives in Shahe County; Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Zhuozhou County; and Huzhu Agricultural Cooperative in Huanghua County. The Huanghua County Mutual Aid Agricultural Cooperative, which is praised as "rising to the sky in one step," created an amazing miracle of an average yield of 1,023 jin of rice per mu on 9,000 mu of newly opened land. The increased production achievements of the other eight cooperatives were also very prominent, increasing by 37% to more than double compared to the bumper harvest of 1952. From the geographical location of each cooperative, some are in the deep mountainous areas of the eastern foothills of the Taihang Mountains, some are in the low-lying areas of the Bohai Sea coast, and some are in the suburbs of cities. From the soil quality of each cooperative, some are relatively fertile, but some are barren mountainous land, and some are newly reclaimed saline-alkali beaches. Last year, these cooperatives actively adopted a series of measures such as building water conservancy projects, increasing the application of manure, planting more high-yield crops, and implementing continuous cropping and intercropping, and finally leaped forward to exceed the highest target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule.

    增产粮食潜力无穷尽
    河北出现每亩打粮两千斤纪录
    据新华社讯  河北省去年已有十个农业社，共在二十八点四八亩粮田上，创造了亩产粮食双千斤。各社创造双千斤的地，小的是一亩，大的八点三三亩；有水田，也有旱地；有平原，也有山坡。各社双千斤的具体数字是，最少的二千零十多斤，最多的二千二百多斤。这些合作社的名字是：邢台县军营农业社和孟家庄农业社，鸡泽县焦佐农业社，永年县茹佐乡五一农业社，魏县陈岗胜利农业社，临漳县三皇庙红星农业社和城关红光农业社，沙河县西石岭农业社，涉县沙河村农业社和西戍乡友爱农业社。
    此外，河北还有九个农业社，去年全社的粮食每亩达到了千斤。这些社就是邢台市的南园、东南角、南头村、冯家庄和路家园五个农业社，沙河县的花木和连沟两个农业社，涿县先锋农业社和黄骅县互助农业社。被人传颂为“一步登天”的黄骅县互助农业社，在九千亩新开的地上，创造了平均亩产稻谷一千零二十三斤的惊人奇迹，其他八个社的增产成绩也非常突出，分别比大丰收的1952年增产37％到两倍多。从各社的地理位置看，有的在太行山东麓的深山区，有的在渤海之滨的低洼地带，也有的在城市郊区。从各社的土质看，有的比较肥沃，但也有的是瘠薄的山地，有的还是新开垦的盐碱海滩。这些社去年由于积极采取兴修水利、增施粪肥、多种高产作物、实行连作间作等一系列措施，终于一跃而提前十年超过全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的最高指标。
