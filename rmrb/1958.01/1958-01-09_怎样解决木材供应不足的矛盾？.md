    How to Resolve the Contradiction of Insufficient Timber Supply?
    Zhang Chun
    Insufficient timber supply is a current contradiction in China's economic construction. How can this contradiction be resolved? Vigorously afforesting is of course the fundamental measure. However, afforestation requires a considerable amount of time. Trees like fir and Masson pine in the south take about thirty years to grow, while red pine, white pine, and ash in the north take seventy to a hundred years. But economic construction cannot wait. Therefore, the correct way to solve the contradiction between timber supply and demand at present should be to conserve timber and rationally utilize China's existing forest resources. Here, I would like to offer some suggestions in these two aspects.
    Fully Utilize Forest Resources
    Currently, China's forest resources are not utilized rationally enough. According to surveys by forestry industry departments, the remaining branches, twigs, diseased and rotten wood, deadwood, and trimmed materials abandoned in logging areas generally account for more than 10% of timber production. Branches with a diameter of less than six centimeters and twigs less than fifty centimeters long, used as firewood, account for about 15% of production. If state-owned forests in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and the nine southern provinces can fully utilize diseased and rotten wood, twigs, branches, sleeper edging, and other timber in self-operated logging, it is estimated that at least two million cubic meters of timber for handicrafts and papermaking can be increased annually. If all wood scraps less than six centimeters in diameter and less than fifty centimeters long are transported out for use as firewood, it is estimated that three million cubic meters of firewood can be added nationwide each year without expanding the forest logging area.
    However, many forestry industry departments have not yet actively sought ways to expand the utilization of forest resources. The current financial planning systems of forestry industry departments contradict the policy of expanding the utilization of forest resources. For example, the production plans of forestry industry enterprises do not include off-grade timber (i.e., timber that does not meet specifications), or only include a small portion. As a result, the funds, labor, and transportation for managing off-grade timber are not guaranteed in the plan arrangements. The purchase price of off-grade timber is also very low, and farmers do not receive reasonable returns, so they are unwilling to manage it. Because some regulations in the financial system and taxation are not reasonable, managing off-grade timber easily leads to losses, which also hinders the enthusiasm of state-owned logging yards to manage off-grade timber. Therefore, we suggest that relevant departments strive to gradually include the management of off-grade timber in the plan from 1958. The wage quotas and purchase prices for managing off-grade timber should also be reasonably adjusted. In terms of transportation, existing equipment should be fully utilized, and some transportation equipment can be added when necessary to try to transport timber from those remote areas.
    Use Waste and Scrap to Manufacture Artificial Boards
    According to data from the Ministry of Forestry Industry, every three cubic meters of waste material or bark, shavings, cut ends, wood shavings, etc., can be made into one cubic meter of hard fiberboard. This hard fiberboard is suitable for making doors, windows, furniture, vehicle and ship decoration, packaging, and other uses. Using 1.3 stacked cubic meters (a stacked cubic meter is a unit of calculation for scattered wood) of waste material can produce one cubic meter of particleboard, which is used almost like natural wood. According to calculations, near the storage yard of a forestry industry bureau with an annual timber harvest of 200,000 cubic meters, a fiberboard factory with an annual output of 18,000 cubic meters, or a particleboard factory with an annual output of 45,000 cubic meters, can be built just to utilize waste material.
    During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the country will supply approximately 20 million cubic meters of logs annually for timber processing. If the utilization rate is 50%, then there will be 10 million cubic meters of waste material. If half of the waste material can be utilized using the above methods, then 5 million cubic meters of usable timber can be added annually. We hope that forestry industry departments can extract a portion of funds from basic construction investment during the Second Five-Year Plan period and appropriately build some comprehensive wood utilization and processing plants based on the distribution of forest resources and sawmills, so as to fully utilize waste material.
    Strengthen the Acquisition of Scattered Timber and Carry Out Forest Tending and Thinning
    There is great potential in both of these aspects. According to preliminary plans, the forest areas of Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and Sichuan will tend and thin 1.2 million hectares during the Second Five-Year Plan period. Calculating at 10 cubic meters of timber cleared per hectare, a total of 12 million cubic meters of timber can be cleared. Timber companies also purchase more than 2 million cubic meters of scattered timber annually. We believe that in the future, the supply of timber in the market should implement the policy of local self-sufficiency as the main principle, supplemented by central unified allocation, in production areas and semi-production areas. Starting in 1958, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Sichuan provinces can achieve market timber self-sufficiency by clearing forest farm timber and timber companies' scattered acquisitions. Inner Mongolia, Henan, Yunnan, and other regions should also strive to achieve market timber self-sufficiency in 1959. There are still many areas where small, over-mature forest areas have not been developed due to inconvenient transportation. It is hoped that the relevant departments in these areas will organize farmers to harvest timber in a planned manner based on the timber resources and transportation conditions of their provinces and counties, in order to increase timber for the country.
    Vigorously Conserve Timber in All Aspects
    Currently, the phenomena of wasting timber and using timber unreasonably still exist to a considerable extent in many units. According to incomplete statistics, the consumption of firewood and charcoal in the nine provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou is approximately 20 million cubic meters annually. Among them, about 70% are Masson pine trees and some hardwood trees. The amount of firewood harvested far exceeds the amount of timber harvested for economic construction. Several large and medium-sized cities in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces consume approximately 1.52 million stacked cubic meters of firewood annually; Beijing and Tianjin consume approximately 200,000 cubic meters of firewood annually. The most wasteful are logging yards, timber processing plants, and the families of forestry workers in forest areas. They burn a large amount of timber for cooking and heating.
    There is also waste in the use of raw materials in handicrafts. On the one hand, everyone complains that timber is not good enough and not enough; on the other hand, handicraft cooperatives are stockpiling large quantities of finished products, such as furniture and floorboards. According to a survey by the Hunan Forestry Industry Bureau, by the end of April 1957, handicraft cooperatives in the Changde Special District alone had stockpiled more than 1,146,900 pieces of woodenware. There is also waste in civilian timber. For example, when building houses in southern forest areas, whether bungalows or buildings, wood is used all over, inside and out. Some departments also ask the state for good timber for whatever purpose; some departments make plans that are "rather more than less" and want to stockpile large amounts of timber. In addition, the phenomena of using high-quality timber for inferior purposes, using large timber for small purposes, and using long timber for short purposes are also very serious.
    We believe that the phenomenon of wasting timber must be resolutely stopped. All construction units and material supply departments should reduce the required amount of materials to the minimum standard, and those that are not urgently needed should be used later, used less, or replaced with other materials. In addition to developing other fuel resources, we must also fully utilize tree branches as fuel. 135 logging yards in the Yichun Forest Area, Jilin Province Forest Area, and Harbin Forest Area have been using branches as fuel, saving a total of 1,291,600 cubic meters of timber throughout the year. If all forest areas in Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Yunnan, and the nine southern provinces switch to burning branches, a minimum of 2 million cubic meters of timber can be saved annually. Residents of cities in North and Northeast China should gradually switch to using honeycomb coal stoves. According to a typical survey in Beijing, a family of seven can save 900 pounds of coal and 360 pounds of firewood per year by burning honeycomb coal instead of briquettes. If all 600,000 households in Beijing switch to using honeycomb coal stoves, approximately 200 million pounds of firewood can be saved annually.
    Leaders of all departments that use timber and forestry industry departments should widely publicize the importance of conserving timber to employees and the masses, and help them establish the concept of cherishing and conserving timber. This is an important link in carrying out the timber production increase and conservation movement in the future.

    怎样解决木材供应不足的矛盾？
    张春
    木材供应不足是当前我国经济建设中的一个矛盾。这个矛盾怎样解决呢？积极造林当然是根本的措施。但是，造林需要相当长的时间，像南方的杉树、马尾松等生长起来需要三十年左右，北方的红松、白松、水曲柳等，需要七十年到一百年。而经济建设却不能等待。因此，目前正确解决木材供需矛盾的办法，应该是节约木材和合理利用我国现有的森林资源。在这里，我想就这两个方面提出几点意见。
    充分利用森林资源
    目前，我国森林资源利用得还不够合理。据森林工业部门调查，遗弃在采伐区的剩余枝桠、梢头木、病腐木、枯木和截头去尾的材料，一般约占木材生产量的10％以上。直径不满六公分的枝桠和长不满五十公分的梢头木，做烧柴用了的，约占生产量的15％左右。东北、内蒙古和南方九省林区的国有林，自营采伐部分，如果能充分利用病腐木、梢头木、枝桠、枕木边皮等木材，估计每年最少可以增产手工业用材和造纸用材二百万立方公尺。如将直径六公分以下和长不足五十公分的木头木尾全部运出来做烧柴用，估计在不扩大森林采伐面积的条件下，全国每年可增加烧柴三百万立方公尺。
    但是，不少森林工业部门到现在还没有积极设法扩大利用森林资源。森林工业部门现行的某些财务计划制度同扩大利用森林资源的方针是矛盾的。例如，森林工业企业的生产计划中，有的没有包括等外材（即不合规格的木材），有的只包括很少一部分，因而经营等外材的资金、劳动力、运输等，在计划安排上就没有保证。等外材的收购价格也很低，农民得不到合理收益，不愿意经营。因为财务制度和税收方面的某些规定不够合理，经营等外木材容易造成亏损，也妨碍了国营伐木场经营等外材的积极性。因此，我们建议有关部门从1958年起，争取逐步把经营等外材列入计划。经营等外材的工资定额、收购价格，也应该合理的调整。在运输方面，应该充分利用现有设备，必要时还可以增加一些运输设备，尽量设法把那些偏僻地区的木材运出来。
    利用废材碎料制造人造板材
    根据森林工业部的资料，每三立方公尺废材或板皮、刨花、截头、木梢等，能制成硬纤维板一立方公尺。这种硬纤维板适用于做门窗、家具、车船装修，包装等多种用途。利用一点三层积立方公尺（层积立方公尺是零星木材的计算单位）的废材，可以制成碎木刨花板一立方公尺，使用起来同天然木材差不多。据计算，在年采二十万立方公尺木材的森林工业局的贮木场附近，仅是为了利用废材，就可以建设一个年产一万八千立方公尺的纤维板工厂，或一个年产四万五千立方公尺的碎木刨花板工厂。
    在第二个五年计划期间，全国每年供应制材加工的原木约为二千万立方公尺，如果利用率是50％，废材便有一千万立方公尺。如果能运用上述办法利用一半废材，那末每年也能增加五百万立方公尺的可用木材。我们希望森林工业部门在第二个五年计划期间，能够从基本建设投资中抽出一部分资金，根据森林资源和制材厂的分布情况，适当建设一些木材综合利用加工厂，以便充分利用废材。
    加强收购零星木材和进行森林抚育采伐
    这两方面的潜力很大。根据初步计划，内蒙古、黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、四川五个林区在第二个五年计划期间，抚育采伐的面积将达一百二十万公顷，按每公顷清理出十立方公尺木材计算，共可清理出一千二百万立方公尺木材。木材公司每年自购的零星木材也在二百万立方公尺以上。我们认为，今后市场上木材的供应，在产区和半产区应实行当地自给为主、中央统一调剂为辅的方针。从1958年开始，黑龙江、吉林、四川三省靠清理林场木材和木材公司零星收购，就可以作到市场木材自给。内蒙古、河南、云南等地区，也争取在1959年作到市场木材自给。现在还有许多地区，由于交通不便，小片过熟林区还没有开发。希望这些地区的有关部门根据本省、本县的木材资源情况和运输条件，有计划地组织农民采伐，以便为国家增加木材。
    从各方面大力节约木材
    目前，浪费木材和使用木材不合理的现象，在很多单位仍然相当严重地存在着。浙江、安徽、福建、江西、湖南、湖北、广东、广西、贵州九省木柴木炭的消费量，据不完全统计，每年约在二千万立方公尺左右。其中大约有70％是马尾松树和一些硬杂木。烧柴所采伐的数量，远远超过了经济建设用材的采伐数量。辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省的几个大中城市，每年劈柴消费约有一百五十二万层积立方公尺；北京、天津两市每年木柴消费约为二十万立方公尺。最浪费的是林区伐木场、制材加工厂和林区职工家属。他们为了烧饭取暖，烧毁了大量木材。
    手工业使用原材料也有浪费现象。一方面大家吵着木材不好不够，另一方面手工业社又积压着大量制成品，像家具、铺板等。据湖南森林工业局调查，仅常德专区1957年4月末统计，手工业社就积压木器一百一十四万六千九百多件。民用材也有浪费。如南方林区建筑房屋，不论平房或楼房，上下周围全用木材。也有一些部门不管什么用途都向国家要好木材；有的部门作计划时
  “宁多勿少”，要去大量木材积压起来。另外，优材劣用、大材小用、长材短用等现象也很严重。
    我们认为，浪费木材的现象必须坚决设法制止。一切施工单位和材料供应部门，应该把需材数量缩减到最低标准，非迫切需要的应该缓用、少用，或用其他材料代替。除了开辟其他燃料资源以外，还要充分利用树木枝桠作燃料。伊春林区、吉林省林区、哈尔滨林区，已经有一百三十五个伐木场利用枝桠作燃料，全年共节约木材一百二十九万一千六百立方公尺。如果内蒙古、四川、云南及南方九省林区全部改烧枝桠，每年最低限度可以节约木材二百万立方公尺。华北、东北城市居民应该逐渐改用蜂窝煤炉子。据北京市典型调查，在七口之家，烧蜂窝煤比烧煤球一年可以节省煤炭九百斤，同时节省劈柴三百六十斤。如果全北京市六十万户居民全部改用蜂窝煤炉，一年约可节省劈柴二亿斤。
    一切使用木材的部门和森林工业部门的领导人员，都应该对职工和广大群众广泛宣传节约木材的重要意义，帮助他们树立起爱护和节约木材的观念。这是今后开展木材增产节约运动的重要一环。
