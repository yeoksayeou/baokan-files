    Official-Businessman
    Not long after the former Governor of Indiana, Craig, took office, a salesman named Mogelner moved to Indianapolis, the state capital. Mogelner was originally a women's clothing salesman, but after moving, he switched to selling highway equipment. He hired two close friends of the governor as his "public relations representatives" for a fee of US$48,000.

    Mogelner thus began a highly profitable business. He sold machine oil that cost US$1.51 per gallon to the government at a high price of US$8.10. The former chairman of the Highway Commission refused to use the products promoted by Mogelner and was removed from his post, replaced by a man named Smith. During Smith's twenty months in office, Mogelner sold more than one million US dollars worth of highway equipment, netting a commission of 190,000 US dollars. Smith's remuneration was more than 40,000 US dollars.

    Smith also colluded with union scabs from yellow unions, using aliases to buy farmers' land at low prices and then reselling it to the government at high prices as the roadbed for highways. Land bought for 2,500 US dollars was often sold for as much as 25,000 US dollars, making a tenfold profit in one transaction.

    The above-mentioned matters were revealed in a recent issue of the American magazine "The New Republic," and are only part of the materials of a case of collusion between officials and businessmen for personal gain and embezzlement.

    The investigation and trial of Smith and Mogelner's illegal case has been protracted for years, and a verdict has only recently been reached. However, the judicial authorities whitewashed Governor Craig, who had completed his term of office, believing that he had no legal responsibility.

    The new Governor of Indiana, Handley, who took office with the slogan of eliminating corruption, has been in office for almost a year. However, according to "The New Republic," scandals of Indiana officials engaging in corruption, embezzlement, and dereliction of duty have increased rather than decreased. Noel, the official in charge of taxation, had to resign due to repeated acceptance of bribes and a tarnished reputation. Ralding, the official in charge of highway safety in the Highway Commission, has not yet been sanctioned for using his position to engage in commercial activities. (Leshan)

    亦官亦商
    美国印第安纳州前任州长克雷格上任不久以后，有一个名叫摩吉尔纳的推销商人搬到了州政府的所在地——印第安纳波里斯。摩吉尔纳本来是妇女服装推销商人，迁居以后改行从事推销公路器材。他以美金四万八千元的报酬聘请了州长的两位密友作他的“公共关系代表”。
    摩吉尔纳就这样开始了利市百倍的生意。他把价格美金一元五角一加仑的机器油，以美金八元一角的高价出售给政府。原任公路委员会主席拒绝采用摩吉尔纳推销的商品，被撤去了职务，由一个名叫史密斯的人来接任。在史密斯任职的二十个月里，摩吉尔纳推销了价值一百万美元以上的公路器材，净赚了十九万美元的佣金。史密斯得到的报酬是四万多美元。
    史密斯又与黄色工会的工贼勾结，利用化名贱价收买农民土地，然后高价转售给政府作为公路的路基。二千五百美元收进的土地，往往以二万五千美元的高价脱手，一转手暴利十倍。
    以上这些事情是最近一期美国“展望”杂志透露出来的，只是一件官商勾结营私舞弊案件的部分材料。
    史密斯与摩吉尔纳违法案的调查审讯迁延经年，最近才作出判决。可是司法当局为任职期满的州长克雷格洗刷了一番，认为他并没有法律上的责任。
    以肃清贪污为口号的印第安纳州新州长汉德雷，上任已经快满一年了。但是据“展望”杂志透露，印第安纳州官员营私舞弊、监守自盗的丑闻有增无减。负责税务的官员诺尔，由于先后受贿多次，声名狼籍，不得不去职。公路委员会负责公路安全工作的负责官员拉尔丁利用职务从事商业活动，还没有受到制裁。　（乐山）
