Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 6th – The Burmese Goodwill Economic Delegation, headed by the Deputy Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, U Kyaw Nyein, concluded its visit to China and left Kunming by special plane at 10:30 am today to return home.

Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein said at the airport that the very thoughtful reception given to them by the people of China in various places proved the deep friendship of the Chinese government and the Chinese people towards the Burmese people. Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein spoke of the close geographical, ethnic, and political relationship between China and Burma. He said, "When we look back on history, we can see that the destinies of the two countries are linked. Those enemies who invaded China often invaded Burma before invading China." He also said that now the People's Republic of China has become a strong country that fears no imperialism and has begun its Second Five-Year Plan, working hard on construction. We in Burma have also become an independent country that fears no imperialism and are also working hard to build our own country. Therefore, the Burmese and Chinese peoples not only demand world peace together, but also demand peaceful coexistence, as determined by the Five Principles jointly created by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Nu. Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein hoped that there would be more opportunities to receive Chinese friends in Burma in the future, and he finally shouted, "Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!"

Liu Minghui, Acting Governor of Yunnan Province, said in his speech that he sincerely thanked the Burmese Goodwill Economic Delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein for bringing the deep friendship of the Burmese people. He eagerly looked forward to Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and Burmese friends coming to our country to visit relatives and friends at any time.

Yao Zhongming, Chinese Ambassador to Burma, accompanied Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and others to Rangoon on the same plane today.

More than 1,000 people from all ethnic groups and walks of life, including Kunming Mayor Pan Shuoduan, were at the airport to see off the distinguished Burmese guests.

Burmese Consul General in Kunming, U Maung Maung Toe, and Consul of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Kunming, Le Tung Son, also went to the airport to see them off.

On the evening of the 5th, Liu Minghui, Acting Governor of Yunnan Province, held a banquet to bid farewell to the Burmese Goodwill Economic Delegation and invited the distinguished guests to watch a song and dance performance.
