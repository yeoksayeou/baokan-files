Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 29th – Tianjin University's special cadre class, which trains veteran worker-peasant cadres to master scientific and technological knowledge, is proving highly effective.

The thirty-two students in Tianjin University's special cadre class are divided between the departments of Chemical Engineering and Hydraulic Engineering. They are all section-level cadres or factory and mine leaders with more than fifteen years of revolutionary experience, and their average age is thirty-six or thirty-seven. When they joined the revolution, most of them only had primary or junior high school education, and a few had attended high school twenty years ago, but their science courses were almost completely neglected. Faced with this situation, the teaching plan for the special class when it first opened in May 1956 was based on the level of junior high school graduates. However, problems arose not long after the start of the semester: the educational levels of the veteran cadres varied greatly, and it was difficult to complete the teaching plan with twenty-nine class hours per week. Therefore, the school revised the teaching plan, dividing the students into Class A and Class B. The curriculum was also supplemented with junior high school algebra, geometry, and physics, and the number of class hours per week was reduced to about twenty, with a maximum of no more than twenty-three. In addition, the professional studies of each student were determined according to their specific business needs; at the same time, after completing the professional courses, some courses that they specifically needed were taught in combination with the specific positions held by each student. For example, Sun Shuping, a student in the Hydraulic Engineering Department and Director of the Design Bureau of the Navigation Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, is now studying hydraulic engineering construction, and in the future, he can also specifically listen to some courses in water harbor engineering. This teaching plan is better able to suit the specific circumstances of the veteran cadres, closely integrates their practical needs, and ensures the quality of teaching without overburdening the students.

Tianjin University also sent its most experienced senior teachers to teach the students in the special class. Professor Han Qingbo, Director of the Mathematics Teaching and Research Section and an expert in geometry, is responsible for teaching plane geometry, solid geometry, and analytical geometry from junior high school to high school levels in the special class. The directors of the General Chemistry Teaching and Research Section, the Physics Teaching and Research Section, and the Surveying Teaching and Research Section also teach chemistry, physics, and surveying courses in the special class. These senior teachers have rich teaching experience, and they are patient and meticulous in their lectures, able to explain from the simple to the complex, and they pay special attention to the characteristics of the cadres being older and having a weaker foundation. In terms of tutoring, the school also set up a question-and-answer room specifically in the cadres' dormitory, and almost every course was assigned a lecturer or teaching assistant to provide tutoring and answer questions. The school also held special symposiums every semester to solicit students' opinions, and a vice president was appointed to lead the work of the special class, regularly understanding the students' situation and helping to solve some difficult problems.

With the help of the teachers, these students demonstrated the excellent qualities of the working class and attacked the scientific fortress with revolutionary zeal. Now, after three semesters of study, they have broken through the most difficult barrier of learning middle school courses and have begun to study university courses. Huo Zigeng, a student in the Chemical Engineering Department and a section chief in the Logistics Department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, and Liang 锫煌, the director and Party secretary of a tannery, originally only had a primary school education and had a difficult time when they started studying, but they studied diligently, overcame their difficulties, and have now begun to study university mathematics, chemistry, and other courses. Chen Zixin, the Director of the Rubber Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, who originally only had a junior high school education, scored five points in most of his course exams. Now, five of the students in the special class with relatively good grades have transferred to undergraduate studies, including Zhang Guozheng, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Shenyang Chemical Plant, who is studying the new science of organic synthesis.

    培养工农老干部掌握科学技术
    天津大学干部特别班效果很好
    新华社天津29日电　天津大学开办干部特别班培养工农老干部掌握科学技术知识，效果很好。
    天津大学干部特别班的三十二名学员分属化工和水利两个系。他们都是参加革命十五年以上的处长级干部或厂矿负责人，平均年龄在三十六、七岁。他们参加革命的时候大部分只有小学和初中程度，少数人曾经在二十年前上过高中，但是理科课程差不多已经荒废了。面对这样的情况，天津大学在1956年5月刚开办特别班时的教学计划是按照初中毕业的程度制订的。但是开学没有多久就发生了问题：在老干部中程度参差不齐，悬殊很大，而且每周要上课二十九个学时，完成教学计划有困难。于是学校重新修订了教学计划，把学员分成甲、乙两班上课。在课程安排上也增添了初中代数、几何、物理等，每周上课减少到二十个学时左右，最多不超过二十三个学时。另外，根据老干部业务上的具体需要，确定了他们各人学习的专业；同时，还确定学完专业课以后，再结合每个学员担任的具体职务，讲授一些他们特殊需要的课程。如水利系学员、交通部航务工程总局设计局局长孙舒平现在学水工建筑专业，将来还可以专门听一些水港专业的课程。这样的教学计划就比较能够适合老干部的具体情况，紧密结合了他们的实际需要，既不使学员负担过重，也保证了教学质量。
    天津大学还派了最有经验的老教师给特别班学员讲课。擅长几何学的数学教研室主任韩清波教授担任特别班从初中到高中的平面几何、立体几何和解析几何的讲授。普通化学教研室主任、物理教研室主任和测量教研室主任等也分别在特别班讲化学、物理、测量等课程。这些老教师教学经验丰富，讲课时耐心细致，能够由浅入深，还特别注意结合干部年龄较大、基础较差的特点来讲课。在辅导中，学校也专门在干部宿舍设立答疑室，几乎每一门课都派了讲师或助教专门担任辅导、负责解答疑问。学校在每个学期也都专门召开座谈会征求学员意见，还指定了一位副教务长担任特别班的领导工作，经常了解学员的情况和帮助解决一些困难问题。
    在教师帮助下，这些学员们显示了工人阶级的优秀品质，以革命干劲来攻打科学堡垒。现在，经过三个学期的学习，他们已经突破了学习中学课程的最困难一关，开始学习大学课程了。化工系学员、解放军后勤某部处长霍子耕和一个制革厂厂长兼党委书记梁?煌，原来都只有小学毕业程度，开始学习的时候很吃力，但是他们刻苦地学习，克服了困难，现在都已经开始学习大学数学、化学等课程。原来只有初中程度的轻工业部橡胶工业管理局处长陈自新，绝大部分课程考试都是五分。现在，特别班已经有五个成绩比较好的学员转入了本科学习，其中沈阳化工厂党委副书记张国政在学习有机合成专业这一新的科学。
