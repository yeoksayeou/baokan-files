Notes

    Dangerous "Defense Line"
    According to the Associated Press: The famous French Maginot Line has begun to be renovated to "prepare it as a strong base for the West in the event of an atomic war." Currently, "atomic weapons have been stored in very deep tunnels."
    In the past, France built the Maginot Line mainly to defend against German attacks. However, during World War II, because the then French government implemented a policy of betraying national interests, this defense line failed to save France. So what will the current Maginot Line bring to France? The situation is even worse! It is actually no longer a "defense line," but an atomic base for the use of the "West" (France itself does not have atomic weapons)! In other words, it is turning into a root of disaster that will bring atomic war upon the heads of the French people.
    If the French rulers truly care about the security of France, then they should not be repairing the Maginot Line, but rather revising France's current policy of following the United States in expanding its arms race. Only on the path of peace can a truly reliable "Maginot" be found.

### 危险的“防线”

    危险的“防线”
    据美联社透露：著名的法国马奇诺防线已经开始重新翻修，以“准备一旦发生原子战争的时候作为西方的坚强据点”。目前，在“很深的地道内已经储藏了原子武器”。
    从前，法国建筑马奇诺防线，主要是防备德国进攻的。可是，在第二次世界大战中，由于当时的法国政府执行了出卖民族利益的政策，这条防线并没有能够挽救法国。那么现在的马奇诺防线会给法国带来什么呢？情况更糟了！它实际上已经不是“防线”，而是一个给“西方”使用的原子基地（法国自己并没有原子武器）！也就是说，它正在变为一个把原子战争引到法国人民头上的祸根。
    法国执政者如果真为法国的安全着想，那就不是要修复马奇诺防线，而是要修改法国目前追随美国扩军备战的政策。只有在和平的道路上才会找到真正可靠的“马奇诺”。
