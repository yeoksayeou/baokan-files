Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 2nd: Indonesian President Sukarno said in his New Year's speech on January 1st that Indonesia needs construction, peace, and the elimination of the remaining colonialism. Sukarno said at the New Year's banquet held at the Presidential Palace that there are some contradictions between the two blocs in the world, but these contradictions can be overcome if the principle of peaceful coexistence is pursued. Many facts have proven that peaceful coexistence can be achieved between countries with different social systems. However, as long as colonialism exists, there will be no true peace, therefore, colonialism must be eradicated root and branch.

Sukarno then said that there are two preconditions for engaging in construction: a peaceful environment and the elimination of colonialism. He said that colonialism still exists in Indonesia, and the Indonesian people must continue to work hard to eliminate the remaining colonialism.

Sukarno said that 1958 is of particular importance to the Indonesian people who are engaged in the struggle against colonialism.

Indonesian Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Djuanda said in his New Year's radio address on New Year's Eve that he believes the struggle to recover West Irian, supported by the Indonesian people and armed forces, will be successful.

    据新华社雅加达2日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺1月1日在他的新年演说中说，印度尼西亚需要建设、和平和消灭残余的殖民主义。苏加诺在总统府举行的新年宴会上说，在世界的两个集团之间是存在着一些矛盾的，但是，如果奉行和平共处的原则，这些矛盾是可以克服的。很多事实已经证明，社会制度不同的国家之间是可以实现和平共处的。但是，只要那里有殖民主义存在，那里就不会有真正的和平，因此，必须把殖民主义连根拔掉。
    苏加诺接着说，从事建设要有两个先决条件：和平环境和肃清殖民主义。他说，在印度尼西亚，殖民主义还存在，印度尼西亚人民必须继续努力肃清残余的殖民主义。
    苏加诺说，1958年对正在进行反对殖民主义斗争的印度尼西亚人民有特别重要的意义。
    印度尼西亚总理兼国防部长朱安达在除夕发表的新年广播演说中说，他相信，争取收复西伊里安的斗争，得到印度尼西亚人民和武装部队的拥护，将会获得成功。
