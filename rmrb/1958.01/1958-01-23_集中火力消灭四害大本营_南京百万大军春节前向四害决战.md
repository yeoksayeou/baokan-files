    Concentrated Firepower to Eliminate the Four Pests' Base Camp
    Nanjing's Million-Strong Army to Wage Decisive Battle Against the Four Pests Before Spring Festival
    (Our report) The people of Nanjing are displaying heroic spirit, concentrating their firepower to fiercely attack the "base camps" where the four pests breed—waste piles, bone stations, basements, and stinking ponds and ditches. This accurate and relentless attack has yielded brilliant results. By January 11th, the city had captured more than 439,600 rats, 68,900 sparrows, eliminated 45 catties of mosquitoes, 231 catties of flies, 30,696 catties of fly pupae, and cleared more than 310,900 loads of garbage.
    Since New Year's Day, the people of Nanjing have concentrated their forces to fiercely attack dozens of four-pest "base camps" throughout the city. Before launching the fierce attacks, each district conducted detailed investigations, established contacts, and organized strike forces. Currently, the vast majority of the city's 15,000+ cesspools have been dug up once to eliminate fly pupae. In Bai Xia District, more than 800 cesspools outside Guanghua Gate have all been "overturned and relocated," eliminating a large number of fly pupae. At the same time, the pit bases were compacted and reinforced to prevent fly pupae from continuing to breed. The waste product company's bone station is the city's "base camp" for fly pupae. The station was infested with maggots indoors, and fly pupae were found under every brick outdoors. In the past, the company leadership was helpless to deal with this situation. This time, the district leadership successively organized the masses to dig up pupae six or seven times, unearthing more than 10,000 catties of fly pupae. The residents of No. 41 Tianzhutanghou Street lived on top of a stinking pond three zhang deep and 190 square meters wide. Every summer, mosquitoes swarmed like smoke, making it impossible for nearby residents to sleep, and causing many illnesses. This time, the district mobilized the masses to pry up the floorboards and fill in the stinking pond, preventing the breeding of mosquitoes. Many places' basements, culverts, and air-raid shelters were fumigated to eliminate mosquitoes and flies.
    In order to completely eliminate mosquitoes and flies, the Nanjing Municipal People's Committee convened a meeting on January 9th with the heads of 18 units, including bone stations, slaughterhouses, meat processing plants, brewing plants, and leather factories, to study the work of eliminating the four pests. At the meeting, these 18 units made a guarantee to the people of the city that "not a single adult fly or fly pupa will survive the winter," and they also issued a challenge to various factories, mines, enterprises, and industries.
    Currently, the city's four-pest elimination campaign is at the eve of its second high tide. On the 13th, the city held a conference of activists in eliminating the four pests, exchanged experiences in eliminating the four pests, and prepared to mobilize and organize a million-strong army to launch a decisive battle against the four pests before the Spring Festival. At present, all relevant parties are actively taking various technical measures to cooperate with the four-pest elimination campaign. Relevant factories are rushing to produce 700,000 "666" smoke bombs for mosquito control, and a large number of "Antu" rodenticides are also being prepared in the suburbs. It is expected that the city will completely eliminate mosquitoes and flies before the Spring Festival and eliminate a large number of rats and sparrows. Soon, the area surrounding Nanjing city within a ten-li radius will become a four-free hygienic protective zone.

    集中火力消灭四害大本营
    南京百万大军春节前向四害决战
    本报讯　南京市人民正以英雄的气概，集中火力，向孳生四害“大本营”——废品堆骨站、地下室、臭水塘沟等地进行猛攻，因而打得既准又狠，取得了辉煌战果。到本月11日，该市城区共捕捉到老鼠四十三万九千六百多只，麻雀六万八千九百多只，消灭蚊子四十五斤，苍蝇二百三十一斤，蝇蛹三万零六百九十六斤，清除垃圾三十一万零九百多担。
    元旦以来，南京市人民集中力量向全市几十处四害“大本营”猛攻。在发动猛攻以前，各区都进行了细致的调查、联系和组织突击的工作。现在，全市一万五千多个粪坑，绝大部分已翻挖了一次蝇蛹。白下区光华门外八百多个粪坑全部“翻身、搬家”，消灭了大量蝇蛹，同时把坑基打紧夯实，不让蝇蛹继续孳生。废品公司堆骨站是该市蝇蛹的“大本营”，这个站室内蛆爬，室外块块砖下是蝇蛹，过去公司领导上对这种状况束手无策，这次区的领导上先后组织群众突击挖蛹六、七次，共挖出蝇蛹一万多斤。天主堂后街四十一号住户住在一个三丈深一百九十平方公尺宽的臭水塘上，每年夏天蚊子多得像烟一样，附近群众无法入睡，生病的人很多，这次区里发动群众把地板撬起来填平了臭水塘，制止了蚊子的孳生。许多地方的地下室、涵洞、防空洞都用烟熏等办法消灭蚊蝇。
    为了彻底消灭蚊蝇，南京市人民委员会于本月9日召集堆骨站、屠宰场、肉类加工厂、酿化厂、皮革厂等十八个单位负责人研究除四害工作。会上，这十八个单位向全市人民提出了“不让一个成蝇、蝇蛹过冬”的保证书，并且向各厂矿、企业、行业提出挑战。
    目前，全市除四害运动正处在第二个高潮的前夕。13日，全市举行了除四害积极分子大会，交流了除四害经验，准备在春节前再动员组织一百万大军向四害展开决战。现在各有关方面正积极采取各种技术措施配合除四害运动，有关厂正赶制七十万枚灭蚊用的“六六六”烟雾剂，郊区灭鼠用的大量“安妥”药剂也在调配。预计春节前全市可全歼蚊、蝇，并且消灭大量鼠雀。不久，南京市环城十里宽周围地区将成为四无卫生防护地带。
