See Who Finishes Greening First
    Large-Scale Afforestation Campaign Unfolds Across the Country

    (Our Report) A large-scale afforestation campaign is unfolding.

    According to incomplete statistics from thirteen provinces including Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Gansu, from November of last year to the present, over 12,360,000 mu have been afforested (including 4,450,000 mu sown with oil-tea). In addition to concentrated afforestation of large areas, Jiangsu and Shandong have planted over 123 million trees along roadsides, riversides, houses, and villages. Hebei plans to complete the greening of all areas around roadsides, riversides, houses, and villages this year. Although Gansu's climate is arid and afforestation conditions are difficult, it still plans to afforest 10 million mu this year. Qin'an County in Gansu Province, defying the historical custom of not afforesting in winter due to the freezing weather, has afforested 320,000 mu, completing 80% of the year's afforestation task. Guangdong Province plans to afforest 12 million mu this year and has already collected 12 million jin of seeds. Hunan Province has afforested 1,775,000 mu, accounting for 35% of the province's afforestation task for this year. Three special districts and five counties in Hunan plan to have 1,186 "Thousand-Mu Forest Cooperatives," 102 "Five-Thousand-Mu Forest Cooperatives," and 11 "Ten-Thousand-Mu Forest Cooperatives" this year.

    The characteristics of this year's afforestation campaign are: early start; close integration with agricultural production; and attention to promoting local typical experiences. In the vast southern regions that do not freeze or have not yet frozen, only some areas had afforestation activities in previous winters. Last winter broke the convention, and a vigorous afforestation campaign was launched comprehensively. Winter afforestation is followed by spring afforestation without interruption. This will change the past situation of afforestation being too late and having low survival rates.

    看谁先完成绿化
    大规模的造林运动在各地展开
    本报讯　一个大规模的造林运动正在展开。
    据福建、江苏、浙江、广东、广西、湖南、湖北、四川、贵州、山东、河南、安徽、甘肃等十三个省不完全统计，从去年11月到目前为止，已经造林一千二百三十六万余亩（其中油茶播种四百四十五万亩）。江苏、山东除集中成片造林外，并在四旁植树一亿二千三百多万株。河北计划在今年全部完成四旁绿化。甘肃虽然气候干旱，造林条件困难，但今年仍将造林一千万亩。甘肃省秦安县在天寒地冻的情况下，打破了历史上冬季不造林的习惯，造林三十二万亩，完成全年造林任务80％。广东省计划今年造林一千二百万亩，现已采种一千二百万斤。湖南省已造林一百七十七万五千亩，占全省今年造林任务的35％。湖南三个专区五个县，计划今年出现一千一百八十六个“千亩林社”，一百零二个“五千亩林社”，十一个“万亩林社”。
    今年造林运动的特点是：动手早；和农业生产密切结合；注意推广当地典型经验。南方广大不封冻或未封冻地区，历年冬天都只是部分地区有造林活动，去冬已打破惯例，全面地开展了轰轰烈烈的造林运动。冬季造林后接着春季造林，没有停歇。这样就将改变过去发生过的造林过晚、成活率低的情况。
