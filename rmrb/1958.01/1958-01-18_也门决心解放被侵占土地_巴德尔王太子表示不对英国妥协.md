Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 17th: Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Crown Prince Badr told reporters from the Middle East News Agency in Cairo on the 16th that Yemen is determined to liberate Aden and the southern Yemeni region known as the Protectorate, and return these places to the motherland.

Badr said that Yemen will never relax its efforts and will not agree to compromise with Britain. He said that the negotiations he held with Britain in London last November on resolving these issues were unsatisfactory.

Speaking of Soviet aid to Yemen, Badr said that the content, form, and methods of the aid provided were in line with Yemen's wishes. He said that the Soviet experts currently in Yemen will play their role in the technical and economic fields for the greatest benefit of Yemen.

Badr will leave Cairo for Syria today.

During his stay in Egypt, President Nasser received Crown Prince Badr on the 16th.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, January 16th: Beirut News: The Yemeni Embassy in Lebanon announced on the 15th that the British troops concentrated in Aden have once again launched an attack on Yemen. The British colonialists used various weapons such as airplanes, tanks, and heavy artillery to destroy Yemeni positions.

The statement issued by the Yemeni Embassy said that in the past two days, British troops have been attacking the Bayda region day and night. At the time of the statement, the Yemeni National Army was still holding its positions, which were surrounded by rubble and wood left after the collapse of houses.

The statement also said that British reinforcements equipped with various weapons are still being sent to the battle site.

Observers here point out that since Crown Prince Badr, under the instructions of the King, established and developed friendly and economic and cultural relations with many countries known for their opposition to imperialism and their struggle for national independence, the imperialists' hatred of Yemen has reached its peak.

    也门决心解放被侵占土地
    巴德尔王太子表示不对英国妥协
    据新华社开罗17日电　也门副首相兼外交大臣巴德尔王太子16日在开罗对中东通讯社记者说，也门决心解放亚丁和被称为保护地的也门南部地区，使这些地方回归祖国。
    巴德尔说，也门决不会放松努力，也不会同意和英国妥协。他说，他去年11月在伦敦同英国就解决这些问题举行的谈判是不能令人满意的。
    在谈到苏联对也门的援助时，巴德尔说，提供援助的内容、形式和方法都符合也门的希望。他说，目前在也门的苏联专家将为也门的最大利益在技术和经济方面发挥他们的作用。
    巴德尔将在今天离开罗去叙利亚访问。
    在埃及期间，纳赛尔总统曾在16日接见了巴德尔王太子。
    据新华社大马士革16日电　贝鲁特消息：也门驻黎巴嫩公使馆15日宣布，集中在亚丁的英国军队再次对也门发动了进攻，英国殖民者使用了飞机、坦克、重炮等各种武器来摧毁也门的阵地。
    也门公使馆发表的声明说，在最近两天中，英军日夜不停地攻击贝达地区，在发表声明的时候，也门国民军仍旧坚守着自己的阵地，阵地周围都是房屋坍毁以后留下来的碎石和木头。
    声明又说，配备着各种武器的英国援军仍在陆续开往作战地点。
    此间观察家指出，自从巴德尔王太子根据国王的指示同许多以反对帝国主义和争取民族独立斗争著称的国家建立和发展友好和经济文化关系以来，帝国主义者对也门的仇恨达到了高峰。
