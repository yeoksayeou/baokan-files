Resolution of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference
Condemning Racial Discrimination Policies

Resolution of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference on the Issue of Racial Discrimination

I.	We note with grave concern and deep regret that, due to foreign rule and imperialism, many countries in the world, particularly South Africa, are practicing racial discrimination policies;

II.	We note the serious consequences of the racial discrimination policies practiced against the world's people of color and other parts of humanity, which are: lowering the living standards of the people who are discriminated against, causing them to suffer from disease, ignorance, and poverty, and creating resentment among them towards the governments and individuals practicing racial discrimination;

III.	We note that the real causes of this racial discrimination are the desire for political domination and economic greed, as well as contributing factors such as social, customary, and traditional practices;

IV.	We note with satisfaction the efforts made by some international organizations and the United Nations to find ways to eliminate racial discrimination and safeguard the interests of minorities;

Therefore, we, the people of Asian and African countries gathered here, resolve:

I.	To condemn racial discrimination policies in whatever form they exist;

II.	A. Expresses great regret at South Africa's continued disregard for United Nations resolutions;

	B. Demands that South Africa fulfill its obligations to the United Nations Charter as a full member of the United Nations;

III.	Recommends to the governments of all countries that practice racial discrimination that each country take steps to ensure:

	A. The abolition of all laws and regulations that legalize racial discrimination or various forms of segregation;

	B. The granting of freedom of speech and the right of association to all persons without discrimination;

	C. The granting of the right to vote and to be elected as members of parliament to all persons over a certain age, regardless of skin color, race, or creed;

	D. The implementation of equal pay for equal work for men and women, and the abolition of forced labor;

	E. The granting of equal civil rights to all citizens without reservation;

	F. The abolition of all land laws that enable Europeans to force people of color to cede land;

	G. The granting to all individuals and groups the right to increase wealth in a planned economy agreed upon by all citizens.

We call upon the member states of the United Nations and the peoples of all countries to spare no effort in taking measures to eliminate racial discrimination, and at the same time we call upon all international institutions to continue their efforts to combat racial discrimination.

    亚非人民团结大会决议
    谴责种族歧视政策
    亚非人民团结大会关于种族歧视问题的决议
    一、我们怀着严重关切和深为遗憾的心情注意到，由于外国统治和帝国主义，世界上许多国家实行种族歧视政策，特别是南非；
    二、我们注意到对世界有色人种和人类其它部分所实行的种族歧视政策的严重后果，这种后果是：使遭到歧视的人民的生活水平降低，使他们饱受疾病、愚昧和贫困的折磨，并且造成他们对实行种族歧视的政府和那些人的满怀愤恨；
    三、我们注意到，造成这种种族歧视的真正原因是政治统治的欲望和经济上的贪心，以及像社会上、习惯上和传统上那样的一些促成因素；
    四、我们满意地注意到一些国际组织和联合国为寻求消除种族歧视和保障少数民族利益的方法而作的努力；
    为此，我们在这里集会的亚非各国人民通过决议：
    一、谴责不论以何种形式存在的种族歧视政策；
    二、甲、对南非不断藐视联合国决议的态度感到非常遗憾；
    乙、要求南非履行它作为联合国正式会员国而对联合国宪章所承担的义务；
    三、向世界各国政府建议，凡实行种族歧视的每一个国家都采取步骤来保证：
    甲、取消使种族歧视或各种隔离合法化的一切法律和条例；
    乙、不加歧视地给所有的人以言论自由和结社权利；
    丙、凡超过一定年龄的人，不分肤色、种族或信仰，都给予选举和被选为议员的权利；
    丁、实行男女同工同酬，废除强迫劳动；
    戊、毫无保留地给所有公民以平等的公民权；
    己、废除一切使欧洲人能够迫使有色人让与土地的土地法；
    庚、给所有个人和集团以在全体公民都同意的计划经济中增加财富的权利。
    我们要求联合国各会员国和各国人民不遗余力地采取措施来消灭种族歧视，同时我们要求所有国际机构继续努力同种族歧视作斗争。
