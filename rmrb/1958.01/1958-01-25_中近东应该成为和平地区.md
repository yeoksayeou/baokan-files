    The Middle East Should Become a Region of Peace
    Commentator of this newspaper
    The TASS statement authorized on the 21st exposed the United States' war plan to endanger peace in the Middle East at the upcoming Baghdad Pact Ankara Conference. The statement emphasized, "The Middle East should and can become a region of peace without, and should not have, nuclear weapons and rocket weapons, a region where all countries coexist peacefully and cooperate in a friendly manner." This new Soviet peace proposal has been valued and welcomed by political figures and public opinion in Arab countries such as Egypt and Syria, and has received widespread positive response around the world. Peace-loving people unanimously believe that this is a vivid manifestation of the Soviet Union's infinite concern for the interests of the people of the Middle East and the interests of world peace, and a significant contribution made by the Soviet Union to the current struggle of the people of the world to safeguard peace.
    Recently, the Soviet Union has put forward a series of peace initiatives to ease international tensions and strive for peaceful coexistence among countries. At present, the call for holding an East-West summit and easing international tensions has become the common voice of the people of all countries. At the same time, the anti-colonial movement in Asian and African countries has reached a new upsurge. The glorious achievements of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference have further increased the determination of the Asian and African people to fight against colonialism and safeguard peace and national independence. In the Middle East, the people of Arab countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Yemen are fighting against imperialist aggression and conspiracies and for the maintenance of national independence and peace. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" and the Baghdad Pact have been met with increasingly widespread opposition. Recently, Saudi Arabian Prime Minister Faisal also stated that his government refuses to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Lebanese government officials said that Lebanon has no intention of changing its policy of not participating in military blocs.
    This situation is unfavorable to the United States' pursuit of its arms expansion, war preparations, and colonial aggression plans. The United States is afraid that the continued easing of the international situation will cause it to lose its excuse for its foreign aggressive policy. Therefore, immediately following the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United States is again using another military aggression group it manipulates—the Baghdad Pact—to step up its war preparations in the Middle East. Although the United States is not a formal member of the Baghdad Pact, it is particularly enthusiastic about the Ankara meeting, and even sent Secretary of State Dulles to lead an "observer" delegation to participate in the meeting. The purpose is to cheer on the Baghdad Pact, further control the Baghdad Pact countries, and repair the US aggression plan in the Middle East, in order to aggravate tensions in the Middle East and threaten peace in the Middle East.
    According to various sources, the United States is attempting to achieve the following specific goals through the Ankara Conference: (1) The United States intends to "link" the Baghdad Pact with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, so that it can intensify its control over the Baghdad Pact countries, force them to undertake the military obligations stipulated by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and serve the United States' war policy and aggressive interests. (2) The United States is attempting to establish missile bases not only in Turkey, but also in the territories of other member states of the Baghdad Pact, in order to threaten the national independence of Arab countries in the Middle East and the peace and security of the Soviet Union. This is to keep the battlefield away from the American mainland, turn the Middle East countries into a hotbed of atomic warfare, and bear the terrible consequences of retaliatory strikes caused by atomic warfare. (3) The United States is attempting to expand the Baghdad Pact with so-called "new economic assistance," first by drawing Lebanon and Jordan into this military group. The United States is doing this to continue to create division and antagonism among Arab countries, and to plot the conspiracy of using Arabs to fight Arabs. Therefore, the US conspiracy at the Ankara Conference is particularly noteworthy.
    These war preparations and aggression plans of the United States not only threaten those Arab countries that pursue a policy of peace and independence, but also, it should be said, primarily threaten the Middle Eastern countries participating in the Baghdad Pact. These countries are facing a serious question: Should they accept the small favors of the United States, lose big for small, and sell their national destiny to the United States, or should they seriously consider the fundamental interests of their own country and safeguard their national sovereignty and security? Obviously, a country like Turkey, which is willing to follow the US policy of war preparations and accept the US deployment of nuclear weapons and rocket equipment on its territory, will only end up harming others and itself. At the same time, we have also seen that some of the adventurous activities carried out by the United States in the past using the Baghdad Pact have not been supported by Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan. Recently, Iranian Foreign Minister Ardalan stated that Iran is unwilling to turn its territory into an anti-Soviet base.
    On the eve of the opening of the Ankara Conference, the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East and maintain peace in the Middle East is very timely. This is a strong support for the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries in the Middle East, and a powerful blow to the US implementation of aggressive plans and war preparation conspiracies in the Middle East. The Soviet Union has always placed the greatest sympathy and support for the peace and independence aspirations of the people of the Middle East. Over the years, whenever the peace and security of the Middle East have been undermined by imperialist aggressive forces, the Soviet Union has always stood on the side of the people of the Middle East and fought to safeguard peace and security in the Middle East. This was the case in the Suez Canal issue, and it was also the case in the recent Syrian incident. This shows that the Soviet Union has always been the most loyal friend of the people of the Middle East.
    The Soviet Union's initiative to turn the Middle East into a region of peace not only conforms to the most fundamental common interests of the people of all countries in the Middle East, but is also an important part of the struggle for world peace. People know that the Middle East has an important "strategic position" in the imperialists' war plans, and it is also a focus of imperialist conflicts. If this region can be turned into a region of peace, it will be of great significance to world peace. The Middle East should become a region of peace! This is a common struggle goal of the people of all countries in the Middle East and the people of the world. As long as millions of peace-loving people unite and wage a resolute struggle, this goal can be fully realized. The awakened people of the Middle East love peace and independence, and they no longer want to be enslaved by any colonial forces. If the United States ignores the Soviet Union's warnings and ignores the aspirations of the people of all countries in the Middle East for peace and independence, and obstinately plots aggressive conspiracies that threaten peace and security in the Middle East, it will only suffer more serious failures.

    中近东应该成为和平地区
    本报评论员
    塔斯社在21日受权发表声明，揭露美国在即将举行的巴格达条约集团安卡拉会议上推行危害中近东和平的战争计划。声明强调指出，“中近东应当而且可能成为没有、并且不应当有核武器和火箭武器的和平地区，成为各国和睦相处和友好合作的地区”。苏联这一新的和平建议，已经受到埃及和叙利亚等阿拉伯国家的政界人士和舆论的重视和欢迎，并在全世界得到广泛的良好反响。爱好和平的人们一致认为这是苏联无限关怀中近东人民利益和世界和平利益的生动表现，是苏联对于当前世界人民维护和平的斗争所作的重大贡献。
    最近一个时期以来，苏联为缓和国际紧张局势，争取各国和平共处，曾提出了一系列的和平倡议。目前，要求举行东西方最高级会议、和缓国际局势的呼声，已经成为各国人民共同的声音。同时，亚非各国反殖民主义运动达到了新的高涨。亚非人民团结大会的辉煌成就，更加提高了亚非人民反对殖民主义、维护和平和民族独立的斗争信心。在中近东，埃及、叙利亚和也门等阿拉伯国家的人民正为反对帝国主义的侵略和阴谋活动，为维护民族独立和和平而斗争。“艾森豪威尔主义”和巴格达条约已经遭到越来越普遍的反对。最近，沙特阿拉伯首相费萨尔也表示他的政府拒绝接受“艾森豪威尔主义”。黎巴嫩政府人士表示黎巴嫩无意改变不参加军事集团的政策。
    这种形势，对于美国推行扩军备战和殖民侵略计划是不利的。美国生怕国际局势继续和缓，就会使它的对外侵略政策失去借口。因此，在紧跟着北大西洋条约组织巴黎会议之后，美国又来利用它所操纵的另一个军事侵略集团——巴格达条约集团，在中近东加紧进行备战活动。美国虽然不是巴格达条约集团的正式成员国，却对安卡拉会议特别起劲，甚至派遣国务卿杜勒斯率领“观察员”代表团参加这个会议，目的就是要为巴格达条约集团打气，进一步控制巴格达条约国家，并修补美国在中近东的侵略计划，以加剧中近东紧张局势，威胁中近东和平。
    据各方面透露，美国企图通过安卡拉会议达到以下几个具体目标：（一）美国打算把巴格达条约集团同北大西洋公约集团和东南亚条约集团“联系”起来，以便于它加紧对巴格达条约集团国家的控制，迫使它们承担北大西洋公约集团所规定的军事义务，为美国的战争政策和侵略利益服务。（二）美国企图不仅在土耳其、而且在巴格达条约集团其它成员国家的领土上建立导弹基地，以威胁中近东阿拉伯民族独立国家和苏联的和平安全。这就是要使战场远离美国的本土，把中近东国家变成原子战争的温床，并且承受原子战争所导致报复打击的可怕后果。（三）美国企图以所谓“新的经济援助”为诱饵，来扩大巴格达条约集团，首先是把黎巴嫩和约旦拉入这个军事集团。美国这样作，是要在阿拉伯国家之间继续制造分裂和对立，策划用阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人的阴谋。因此，美国在安卡拉会议上的阴谋活动，是值得特别注意的。
    美国的这些备战和侵略计划，不仅威胁那些执行和平独立政策的阿拉伯国家，而且应该说，它首先威胁了参加巴格达条约的中近东国家。这些国家正面临一个严重的问题：是接受美国的小恩小惠，因小失大，把国家的命运出卖给美国，还是认真地对待自己国家的根本利益，维护自己国家的主权和安全呢？显然的，像土耳其这样甘心追随美国的备战政策，接受美国在自己的领土上设置核武器和火箭装备，结果只会是害人反害己。同时，我们也看到，美国过去利用巴格达条约所进行的某些冒险活动，并没有得到伊朗、伊拉克和巴基斯坦的支持。最近，伊朗外交大臣阿达兰声明说，伊朗不愿意使它的领土变为反苏基地。
    在安卡拉会议开幕的前夕，苏联提出建立中近东无原子区、维护中近东和平的建议，是非常适时的。这是对中近东各国人民和平愿望的一个有力支持，是对美国在中近东执行侵略计划和备战阴谋的一个有力的打击。苏联对于中近东人民的和平与独立的愿望，从来寄予最大的同情和支持。这些年来，每当中近东和平安全遭到帝国主义侵略势力破坏的时刻，苏联总是站在中近东国家人民方面，为维护中近东的和平安全而斗争。在苏伊士运河问题上是这样，在最近叙利亚事件中也是这样。这表明苏联始终是中近东人民的最忠实的朋友。
    苏联关于把中近东变为和平地区的倡议，不仅符合中近东各国人民的最根本的共同利益，而且也是争取世界和平斗争的一个重要部分。人们都知道，中近东在帝国主义的战争计划中具有重要“战略地位”，同时也是帝国主义互相冲突的一个焦点，如果能把这个地区变为和平地区，对于整个世界和平将有重大的意义。中近东应该成为和平地区！这就是中近东各国人民和全世界人民的一个共同的斗争目标。只要千百万爱好和平的人民团结起来，进行坚决的斗争，那么这个目标是完全可以实现的。觉醒了的中近东各国人民热爱和平和独立，他们再也不愿意被任何殖民势力所奴役了。美国如果不顾苏联的警告，不顾中近东各国人民要求和平和独立的愿望，一意孤行，策划威胁中近东和平安全的侵略阴谋，那么它只会遭到更严重的失败。
