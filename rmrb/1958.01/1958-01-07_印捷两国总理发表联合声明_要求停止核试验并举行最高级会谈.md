Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 6th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Czechoslovak Prime Minister Široký, after holding three days of talks, issued a joint statement on January 5th stating that they demanded an immediate cessation of testing nuclear weapons and thermonuclear weapons as the first concrete step towards disarmament, and hoped that in the near future, talks, including the highest-level talks, would be held on the prohibition of nuclear weapons and disarmament.

The joint statement said that an immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing "would create an atmosphere that would make it possible to achieve progress in reaching a universally agreed disarmament plan, in stopping the use and production of nuclear weapons, thermonuclear weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction."

The two Prime Ministers noted with satisfaction the recent unanimous adoption by the United Nations of the resolution on peaceful coexistence among nations. The statement said: "They firmly believe that if all countries can justly implement this declaration, it will help ease international tensions and promote world peace."

In mentioning important international issues in various regions, the joint statement said that the two Prime Ministers were satisfied to see that peace had been maintained in the Middle East recently thanks to the intervention of the United Nations and the support of world public opinion. "They agreed that international problems can only be satisfactorily resolved through peaceful negotiations and without any interference in the independence and sovereignty of the countries concerned."

The statement also said: "They are deeply convinced that the conclusion of military treaties and the formation of military blocs are one of the main causes of international tension and mutual suspicion, and will only exacerbate these situations."

The joint statement expressed sympathy for the struggles of the people of various countries striving to break free from colonial rule.

They expressed deep regret that China's legitimate representation in the United Nations has not yet been restored. They pointed out that this weakens the function of the United Nations. They stated that they would continue to work to ensure that the true representatives of China enter the United Nations without delay.

The two Prime Ministers expressed satisfaction with the development and achievements made in economic, cultural and technical cooperation between India and Czechoslovakia. The joint statement concluded: "They are particularly pleased that an agreement has been reached between the two countries stipulating that Czechoslovakia will assist India in building a metallurgical machinery factory, thereby making a further contribution to the completion of India's construction plan. They look forward to continued cooperation between the two countries to expand trade and enhance economic, industrial and technical relations between the two countries."

All newspapers in the Indian capital on the 6th prominently published the joint statement by Prime Minister Nehru and Prime Minister Široký on the front page.

The "Hindustan Times" wrote in an editorial: The two Prime Ministers have fulfilled "the great responsibility of those who care about peace, which is to use every occasion and opportunity to work for peace."

Prior to this, newspapers throughout India warmly welcomed Široký's visit to India and generally believed that the visit would help further strengthen economic and cultural ties between India and Czechoslovakia.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 6th: Prime Minister Široký was welcomed by the vast number of citizens of Delhi at the Red Fort on the afternoon of the 5th. He delivered a speech at the welcoming rally. He said that the people of Czechoslovakia have always attached great importance to the struggle of the Indian people against colonialism and for world peace. The common goal of striving for world peace is the main foundation of the friendly relations between India and Czechoslovakia.

Prime Minister Široký expressed support for India's proposal to stop nuclear weapons testing and believed that this was the first step in easing international tensions and creating conditions for world peace. He expressed regret that the United States and Britain did not accept the Soviet Union's proposal in this regard.

Prime Minister Široký said, "We once again propose the simultaneous abolition of military treaties such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact. We believe that if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is dissolved, the Warsaw Pact will automatically be abolished." He pointed out that only in this way can peace and security in Europe be established.

Prime Minister Široký in his speech recalled the proposal to establish a neutral zone in Europe. He stressed that the proposal to establish a neutral zone in Europe would be the first step in easing tensions and creating conditions for world peace and security.

Prime Minister Široký left New Delhi on the evening of the 5th for Bakra-Nangal. From there he will begin his visit to other major cities in India. He is scheduled to leave India on January 15th.

    印捷两国总理发表联合声明
    要求停止核试验并举行最高级会谈
    据新华社新德里6日电　印度总理尼赫鲁和捷克斯洛伐克总理西罗基在举行三天会谈以后，1月5日发表联合声明说，他们要求立即停止试验核武器和热核武器，作为裁军的第一个具体步骤，并且希望在最近的将来，就禁止核武器和裁军问题举行会谈，包括最高级的会谈。
    联合声明说，立即停止核武器试验“将会造成一种气氛，使得有可能在达成一项普遍同意的裁军计划方面，在停止核武器、热核武器以及其它大规模毁灭性武器的使用和生产方面取得进展。”
    两位总理满意地注意到最近联合国一致通过的关于各国和平共处的决议。声明说：“他们坚定地相信，如果一切国家都能正当地实现这项宣言，那将会有助于缓和国际紧张局势和促进世界和平。”
    联合声明在提到各个地区的重要国际问题时说，两位总理满意地看到，由于联合国的干涉和世界舆论的支持，中东最近得以保持和平。“他们一致认为，只有通过和平谈判，并且不对有关国家的独立和主权进行任何干涉，国际问题才能得到圆满解决。”
    声明还说：“他们深信，缔结军事条约和成立军事集团，是造成国际间紧张局势和互相猜疑的主要原因之一，而且只会使这些情况更加严重。”
    联合声明对于争取摆脱殖民统治的各国人民所进行的斗争表示同情。
    他们对于至今尚未恢复中国在联合国中的正当代表权一事表示深切的遗憾。他们指出，这就削弱了联合国的功能。他们表示将要继续努力，以求保证毫不延迟地使真正的中国代表进入联合国。
    两位总理对印捷两国在经济、文化和技术方面进行合作而获得的发展和成就表示满意。联合声明最后说：“他们特别感到高兴的是两国间已经达成协议，规定由捷克斯洛伐克帮助印度修建一座冶金机械工厂，从而对印度建设计划的完成作出进一步的贡献。他们期待着两国间继续合作，以求扩大两国间的贸易和增进两国在经济、工业和技术方面的关系。”
    印度首都各报6日都在首页以显著地位刊载尼赫鲁总理和西罗基总理的联合声明。
    “印度斯坦时报”在社论中写道：两国总理已经履行了“关心和平的人的重大责任，这就是利用一切场合和机会为和平而努力。”
    在这以前，印度各地报纸都表示热烈欢迎西罗基访问印度，并且普遍认为，这次访问有助于进一步加强印度和捷克斯洛伐克之间的经济和文化联系。
    据新华社新德里6日电　西罗基总理5日下午在红堡受到德里广大市民的欢迎。他在欢迎大会上发表演说。他说，捷克斯洛伐克人民一向非常重视印度人民为反对殖民主义和争取世界和平而进行的斗争。争取世界和平的共同目标是印捷两国友好关系的主要基础。
    西罗基总理表示支持印度提出的关于停止核武器试验的建议，并且认为这是缓和国际紧张局势以及为世界和平创造条件的第一步。他对美英两国不接受苏联在这方面提出的建议表示遗憾。
    西罗基总理说，我们再次建议同时废除像北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约这样的军事条约。我们相信，如果北大西洋公约组织解散了，华沙条约一定会自动废除。他指出，只有这样才能确立欧洲的和平和安全。
    西罗基总理在演说中追述了在欧洲建立中立区的建议。他强调指出，在欧洲建立中立区的建议将是缓和紧张局势以及为世界和平和安全创造条件的第一步。
    西罗基总理已经在5日晚上离开新德里前往巴克拉—楠加尔。他将从那里开始他对印度其他各大城市的访问。他预定在1月15日离开印度。
