    Xi'an Coal Mining Administration Employees Sharply Criticize
    Greed for Size and Novelty Leads to Serious Waste

    (By our newspaper) In the rectification stage, employees of the Xi'an Coal Mining Administration, based on the principle of "building the country through diligence and frugality," focused on criticizing the leadership's tendency towards grandeur and novelty in construction, which resulted in the waste of state funds.

    Employees exposed and criticized the waste caused by the mentality of pursuing large scale: The newly designed and constructed mines in the Tongchuan mining area generally have an annual output of 450,000 to 900,000 tons. The leadership thought that this would produce more coal, but they did not seriously consider the thin and unstable coal seams in the newly built mining area, nor did they seriously consider whether it was economical. For example, the Wangjiahe No. 1 mine was built on a coal seam only 0.7 to 0.8 meters thick, but the designed capacity was 450,000 tons per year. The annual tunneling quantity had to reach more than 6,000 meters, equivalent to the tunneling quantity of an ordinary 900,000-ton mine. Therefore, the construction time was prolonged, and the cost of coal production after commissioning was also high. Employees believe that if the mine size were reduced, a lot of investment could be saved, and the money could be used to build and renovate some small coal mines. This would not only cost less money but also produce coal quickly.

    The employees also criticized the leadership's failure to pay attention to the use of existing equipment and make use of local resources during the mine renovation project, instead pursuing novelty in everything. For example, the Aganzhen and Shmengou coal mines are close to each other, but each built a set of modern production systems on the ground during the renovation project. The Aganzhen coal mine originally used one-ton mine cars, but switched to two-ton mine cars during the renovation. However, because there were no auxiliary locomotives and other equipment, the use of two-ton mine cars was very labor-intensive, and it was necessary to widen the roadways, which increased the difficulty of transportation management and prolonged the construction time. Although these two mines were renovated, from the perspective of construction time and investment equipment, it was actually equivalent to building two new pairs of mines. The Tongchuan No. 1 Coal Mine did not make full use of the original facilities, and adopted a thorough innovation method in the renovation, spending 8.5 million yuan, but the annual production capacity only increased by 120,000 tons.

    Employees revealed that due to the bureaucracy and subjectivism of the leadership, alarming waste was also caused in construction and non-production construction. For example, the Tongchuan Wangjiahe No. 2 mine suffered a loss of more than 700,000 yuan to the state due to unclear geological conditions and lack of research on geological data during design. The thinness of the coal seam and the difficulty of mining was only discovered during construction, and had to be abandoned.

    Currently, the rectification leading group of this bureau is carefully studying the opinions put forward by the employees and guiding the masses to continue to speak out in depth.

### 西安煤矿管理局职工尖锐批评  贪大求新带来严重浪费

    西安煤矿管理局职工尖锐批评
    贪大求新带来严重浪费
    本报讯　西安煤矿管理局职工在整改阶段的大鸣大放中，根据“勤俭建国”方针，着重批评了领导人员在建设中贪大求新、浪费国家资金的现象。
    职工们揭发和批评了由于贪大思想所造成的浪费情况：铜川矿区新设计和建设的矿井，年产量一般都是四十五万吨到九十万吨。领导人员以为这样就能多出煤，而没有认真考虑新建矿井地区煤层薄和不稳定的特点，也没有认真考虑是否经济。如王家河一号井建在只有零点七至零点八公尺厚的煤层上，而设计能力是年产四十五万吨，每年的掘进数量要达到六千公尺以上，相当于一个普通年产九十万吨矿井的掘进量，因此，建设时间拖长，投入生产后的出煤成本也高。职工们认为，如果将井型缩小，就可以节省很多投资，把这些钱用来新建和改建一些小煤窑，不仅花钱少，还能迅速出煤。
    职工们同时批评了在矿井改建工程中，领导方面没有注意利用原有设备，因陋就简，而是一切求新的做法。例如，阿干镇和石门沟煤矿距离相近，但两矿在改建工程中各在地面上建成一套现代化的生产系统。阿干镇煤矿本来使用一吨矿车，改建时又改成两吨矿车，可是因为没有辅助机车等设备，使用两吨矿车就很费人力，而且要加宽巷道，给运输管理增加了很多麻烦，也拖长了建设时间。这两个矿井虽是改建，但是从建设时间和投资设备上看，实际上等于新建了两对矿井。铜川第一煤矿由于没有充分利用原有设施，在改建中采取了彻头彻尾革新的办法，花费投资八百五十万元，年产能力仅提高十二万吨。
    职工们揭发，由于领导方面的官僚主义和主观主义，在施工和非生产建设上也造成了惊人的浪费。如铜川王家河二号井由于地质情况不清，设计时缺乏对地质资料的研究，在施工中才发现煤层薄，开采困难，不得不报废，给国家造成七十多万元的损失。
    目前，这个局的整风领导小组正在认真研究职工提出的意见，并且引导群众继续深入鸣放。
