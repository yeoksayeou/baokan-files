Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have begun to enthusiastically subscribe to the 1958 National Economic Construction Bonds. The common characteristics of many units in this subscription are: the subscription time is fast, the number of people is large, and the amount of money is increased compared to previous years.
    After the General Logistics Department units began subscribing before New Year's Eve, according to the statistics of eight units, the average has exceeded the planned subscription figure by 43%. Many officers are no longer as financially well-off as they used to be because they have arranged for their families to return to their hometowns to engage in production and because the multi-child subsidies have been abolished. However, in order to support the country's socialist construction, they still actively participated in the subscription. The officers and soldiers of the Oil Department completed the oversubscription by 72% in just over ten minutes, and most people's subscription figures were higher than last year. Zhao Wenbin, the political commissar of a certain unit stationed in the Jinan area, has six children. After the multi-child subsidy was cancelled, his income decreased a lot, but after carefully calculating his income and expenditure, he still subscribed for 150 yuan. Under his influence, 92% of the officers and soldiers of this unit purchased public bonds, and the number of subscriptions in three days exceeded the actual purchase number of last year by more than 63%.
    The broad masses of soldiers and workers, whose awareness has been generally raised in the socialist education movement, are very enthusiastic about subscribing to public bonds this year. Of the more than 8,500 yuan of public bonds subscribed by a certain unit, nearly 3,000 yuan were subscribed by soldiers. A certain unit had a private soldier named Wang Hongzhen, whose family was in a disaster area, who initially subscribed for ten yuan. After the leadership advised him not to buy or buy less, he still insisted on subscribing for three yuan; the nine cooks of this unit also subscribed for twenty-seven yuan.

    认购的时间快　认购的款额多
    解放军官兵踊跃认购公债
    新华社7日讯　中国人民解放军广大官兵开始踊跃认购1958年国家经济建设公债。许多单位在这次认购中的共同特点是：认购的时间快、人数多、款额比往年增多。
    总后勤部各单位在新年前夕开始认购后，据八个单位的统计，平均已超过计划认购数字43％。许多军官由于安置家属还乡生产和取消了多子女补助费，经济上不如过去宽裕，但是为了支援国家社会主义建设，仍然踊跃参加认购。油料部官兵在十多分钟内就超额72％认购完毕，大多数人的认购数字都比去年增多。驻济南地区某部队的政治委员赵文彬有六个孩子，多子女补助费取消后，收入减少了许多，但他仔细计算了自己的收支情况后，还是认购了一百五十元。在他的影响下，这个部队有92％的官兵都购买了公债，三天中认购的数字就超过去年实购数63％以上。
    在社会主义教育运动中觉悟普遍提高的广大士兵和职工们，今年认购公债很踊跃。某部认购的八千五百多元公债中，就有近三千元是士兵认购的。某部有一位家在灾区的列兵王洪振开始认购十元，经领导上劝他不购或少购后仍然坚持认购了三元；这支部队的九名炊事员也认购了二十七元。
