Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th – The world's first electric train operated by an electronic mathematical machine has been successfully tested in the Soviet Union. The "Labor Daily" recently published an article by Osipov, reporting on the journey of this train operated by an "automatic driver."

The test run took place at night, and all operations on the locomotive were handled by specialized automatic equipment. This equipment successfully performed its tasks: taking appropriate measures in a timely manner according to the signals from the automatic block system, maintaining the specified speed limits in the necessary sections, automatically selecting the braking point when approaching a station, reducing speed, and stopping smoothly alongside the platform, arriving at the destination station on time. The driver, Shapko, who was responsible for observing the operating conditions on the locomotive, pointed out with particular satisfaction that the "automatic driver" could successfully replace the most skilled driver. The device was designed by a team of experts led by Nikolaev. The device has instruments that can provide all kinds of information needed to control the train's operation at any time. In addition, there is an electronic and magnetic device with a fixed calculation program that records the requirements for speed, time, and distance. A special calculator can use these materials to solve the differential equations of train operation and find the most favorable speed for the local section. Like any electronic computer, it can perform thousands of mathematical operations in a few seconds.

Osipov pointed out that designers are now further improving individual components of this unit, and more detailed tests will be conducted in the future. He said that the era of completely dispensing with drivers cannot yet be considered to have arrived; at least for the first few years, drivers must remain on the locomotive to observe.

The article concludes by saying that the era of trains running on railways operated by "automatic drivers" is not far off. This will greatly increase railway throughput, and trains can run at maximum speed under absolutely safe operating conditions.

    世界第一列自动操纵火车
    在苏联初步试验成功
    新华社莫斯科8日电　世界上第一列由电子数学机器操纵行驶的电气火车在苏联初步试验成功。“劳动报”最近发表了奥希波夫的一篇文章，报道了这次由“自动司机”操纵的列车行驶的经过。
    这次行驶是在夜间进行的，机车上的一切工作都是由专门自动装置操作的。这个装置成功地执行了自己的任务：及时按照自动闭塞装置的讯号采取相应措施，在必要的地段保持规定的限制速度，在快到站的时候自动选择制动点，减低速度和平稳地停在月台旁，并且正点到达目的站。负责在机车上观察操纵情况的司机沙普柯特别满意地指出，“自动司机”可以成功地代替最熟练的司机。这个装置是以尼古拉耶夫为首的一批专家设计的。装置上有一些仪器，能够随时提供操纵列车行驶所需掌握的各种情况。另外有一个具有固定运算大纲的电子和磁力设备，记载对速度、时间、路程的要求。专门的计算器可以利用这些材料，解开列车运行的微分方程式，找出对本地段最有利的速度。它可以像任何一台电子计算机一样，在若干秒钟内完成数千次数学运算。
    奥希波夫指出，现在设计师们正在进一步改进这个机组的个别部件，今后还要作更细致的试验。他说，还不能认为完全不要司机的时代已经到来，至少在头几年司机必须留在机车上观察。
    文章最后说，由“自动司机”操纵的列车在铁道上奔驰的时代已经不远了。这样就可以大大提高铁路通过能力，列车可以在绝对安全运转条件下以最大的速度来行驶。
