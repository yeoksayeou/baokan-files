    "Conscious" and "Unconscious"
    Xin Wen
    Some people say: "There are two kinds of opposition to the Party and socialism: one is unconscious, and the other is conscious." This view is wrong. This view itself confuses right and wrong on major issues and blurs the line between the enemy and ourselves. The reactionary essence of all rightists is to oppose the leadership of the Party, oppose the socialist system, and attempt to drag China backward.
    Opposition to the leadership of the Party and opposition to socialism versus upholding the leadership of the Party and upholding socialism are antagonistic contradictions. The struggle between the two is a life-and-death one, and these two opposing words and deeds are concrete reflections of the consciousness of two opposing classes. Therefore, there can be no "unconscious" words or deeds of opposing the Party and opposing socialism. We know that consciousness has class character. To examine a person's consciousness, the basis is specific words and actions. And in the examination, we must use the method of class analysis. If we abandon this premise, we will not be able to draw correct conclusions.
    Opposition to the Party and socialism is a reflection of the bourgeois consciousness of rightists. Therefore, we say that the statement "unconscious" opposition to the Party and socialism is wrong. (Excerpt from People's University Weekly)

    “有意识”和“无意识”
    辛文
    有人说：“反党反社会主义有两种：一种是无意识的，一种是有意识的”这种观点是错误的。这种观点的本身是混淆了大是大非，模糊了敌我界限。一切右派分子反动的本质就是反对党的领导，反对社会主义制度，企图把中国拉向后退。
    反对党的领导，反对社会主义与拥护党的领导，拥护社会主义，这是对抗性的矛盾，这两者之间是你死我活的斗争，而这两种对立的言行的本身，就是两个对立阶级意识的具体反映。因此不可能有“无意识”的反对党反对社会主义的言行。我们知道意识是有阶级性的，要考查一个人的意识如何，其根据就是具体言论和行动。并且在考查的时候，要用阶级分析的方法，抛开这一前提，就得不出正确的结论来。
    反党反社会主义是右派分子的资产阶级意识的反映。因此，我们说：“无意识的”反党反社会主义的说法是错误的。　（摘自人民大学周报）
