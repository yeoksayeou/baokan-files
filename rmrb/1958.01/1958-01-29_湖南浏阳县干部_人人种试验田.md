Changsha, January 28th (By our Newspaper) - The advanced experience of cadres in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, farming experimental plots has been fully promoted in Liuyang County, Hunan Province. All of the county's 1,800-plus rural work cadres, starting with the county party secretary, are each farming experimental plots.

Liuyang farmers originally did not have the habit of fermenting pond fertilizer. After cadres at all levels dug ponds in the experimental fields to ferment fertilizer, this method of accumulating fertilizer was quickly promoted throughout the county. In rural Liuyang County, wooden signs for experimental fields can now be seen everywhere, bearing the name of the cadre, indicating the planned output, the amount of fertilizer to be applied, the number of times of plowing and harrowing, and which technical measures are being adopted. Under the influence of the cadre experimental plots, the production plans formulated by the agricultural cooperatives are also very specific.

The county's financial, trade, cultural, and educational cadres stationed in rural areas also farm experimental plots. In Daoyao Township, every cadre in the supply and marketing cooperative and the food company purchasing station has an experimental plot. At the same time, they also set aside a sum of funds to help the agricultural cooperatives carry out experiments in cultivating saplings, building orchards, and raising pigs.

After farming experimental plots, the cadres' work style has also undergone tremendous changes. Cadres who were originally uneasy about their work are now at ease. Last year, the Yanghua Township Party organization sent three cadres to work in three backward agricultural cooperatives. All of them started by farming experimental plots and promoted the production of the entire cooperative. Last winter, Shi Weigang, the county party secretary, personally accumulated fertilizer for three days in Lotus Township and discovered that the agricultural cooperative cadres had a tendency to falsely report the number of fertilizer accumulated. Later, he organized a county-wide inspection, which promoted the production movement.

    湖南浏阳县干部
    人人种试验田
    本报长沙28日电　湖北省红安县干部搞试验田的先进经验，已经在湖南省浏阳县全面推广。全县一千八百多名农村工作干部，从县委书记起，每人都种了试验田。
    浏阳农民原来没有沤制凼肥的习惯，当各乡干部在试验田中挖凼沤肥以后，很快就把这个积肥方法在全县推广了。在浏阳县农村，现在到处都可看到试验田的木牌，上面写着姓名，标明计划产量，施肥多少，犁耙几次，采用哪些技术措施。在干部试验田的影响下，农业社制订的生产计划也很具体。
    这个县分散在农村的财经、文教干部也搞了试验田。大瑶镇的供销社和食品公司采购站每个干部都有试验田，同时还抽出一笔资金，帮助农业社进行培育树苗、造果园、养猪等试验。
    搞了试验田以后，干部思想作风，也起了巨大的变化。原来不安心工作的干部，现在也安心了。杨花乡党组织去年派三个干部到三个落后农业社里去工作，都是从搞试验田入手，推动了全社的生产。县委书记石维纲去冬在荷花乡亲自积了三天肥料，发现了农业社干部有虚报积肥数字的偏向，以后就组织全县大检查，推动了生产运动。
