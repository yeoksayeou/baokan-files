Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th: Following the decision by the Soviet Party and government to build a monument to the artificial Earth satellite in Moscow in 1958, the Moscow City Soviet Executive Committee immediately began soliciting designs for the monument and preparing for its construction. Soviet architects and artists are participating in the design work with great enthusiasm and interest. They have now designed some preliminary drawings.

One drawing depicts a giant artificial satellite carved from stone. Its antennas are made of metal and are about fifty meters long. It looks as if the artificial satellite is rushing forward. It symbolizes the boldness and bravery of human thought. (See picture below)

According to the design of another drawing, the monument will be a slender metal or concrete spire, cylindrical in shape and four hundred meters high, giving the impression of soaring into the sky. A spiral line, made of metal and about sixty meters long, wraps around the lower part of the spire, symbolizing mankind's first liberation from the shackles of Earth's gravity. (See picture on the left)

Another drawing depicts a tall monument. A model of an artificial satellite is placed on the monument, and below the monument are three statues: one of a scientist pointing the way to interstellar space, a metallurgical worker, and a female collective farmer. This symbolizes that the great scientific achievement of the Soviet artificial satellite going into space is the result of their joint labor. (See picture below)

    苏联积极筹建人造卫星纪念碑
    建筑师和艺术家已设计出一批图样
    新华社莫斯科4日电　在苏联党和政府决定1958年在莫斯科建造一座人造地球卫星纪念碑以后，莫斯科市苏维埃执行委员会立即着手征集纪念碑的设计图样和开始建造准备工作。苏联建筑师和艺术家们怀着巨大的热情和兴趣参加设计工作。现在，他们已设计出一些初步的图样。
    有一个图样，设计的是一个用石头凿成的巨大的人造卫星。它的天线是用金属做成的，长约五十公尺。看上去，这个人造卫星正在向前冲去。它象征着人类思想的大胆和勇敢。　（见下图）
    按照另一个图样的设计，这个纪念碑将是一座圆柱形的高达四百公尺的细长的金属或混凝土尖塔，它给人以直冲云霄的感觉。有一条用金属做成的长约六十公尺的螺旋线蟠绕着尖塔的下部，象征着人类第一次脱离地球引力的枷锁。（见左图）
    还有一个图样，设计的是一个高大的纪念碑。碑上放着一个人造卫星的模型，碑下是三个雕像，其中一个是用手指着飞向星际空间道路的科学家，还有一个冶金工人，一个女集体农民。这象征着苏联人造卫星上天这一伟大科学成就是他们共同的劳动成果。（见下图）
