Xinhua News Agency, London, January 14th: A public opinion poll conducted by the "News Chronicle" among various political parties in Britain after Bulganin put forward his peace proposals once again shows that an overwhelming majority of British people are in favor of holding East-West negotiations. Among those surveyed, 65% believe that the best way to avoid a world war is to resolve disputes through peaceful methods such as negotiation, and 73% are in favor of signing a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union.

	Some specific Soviet proposals have gained widespread support in Britain. 75% of poll participants are in favor of holding summit talks between NATO countries and Warsaw Pact countries; 74% believe that nuclear weapons testing should be banned for at least two or three years; 68% are in favor of not storing nuclear weapons in Central Europe; and 53% believe that Britain should still participate in East-West talks even if the United States is unwilling to participate.

	The British press generally reacted coldly to Eisenhower's reply to Bulganin. This reply, as well as the US government's budget message regarding spending vast amounts of money on the nuclear arms race, has aroused dissatisfaction in the British press.

	TASS, London, January 12th: According to the "World News," the British newspaper with the largest circulation, British Labour Party foreign affairs spokesman Bevan published an article expressing his support for holding an East-West summit conference. He advocated accepting the Soviet Union's "three proposals," namely: immediately ceasing the testing of hydrogen and atomic bombs for two or three years; establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe; and establishing observation posts to prevent surprise attacks and establishing aerial photography supervision zones.

	Bevan believes that some other proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, such as the proposal for NATO countries and Warsaw Pact countries to sign a non-aggression treaty, "can be called well-intentioned proposals," but Bevan believes that it is the first three proposals that have "invaluable significance." He believes that accepting these proposals could lead to regular cooperation between major powers, and it might truly require the kind of mutual supervision that Western countries have always insisted on as a condition for disarmament. Bevan also criticized the negative attitude taken by US Secretary of State Dulles towards the Soviet proposals.

    英国大多数人支持苏联建议
    比万赞成举行东西方会谈
    据新华社伦敦14日电　在布尔加宁提出和平建议以后，“新闻纪事报”在英国各政党中所进行的民意测验再一次地表明：压倒多数的英国人赞成举行东西方谈判。在被征询意见的人中，65％的人认为避免发生世界大战的最好方法就是采取谈判等和平方法来解决争端，73％的人赞成同苏联签订互不侵犯条约。
    苏联的一些具体建议在英国获得了广泛的支持。民意测验参加者中有75％的人赞成北大西洋公约组织国家和华沙条约国家之间举行最高级会谈；74％的人认为应该禁止核武器试验至少两三年；68％的人赞成在欧洲中部不存放核武器；53％的人认为在美国不愿意参加的情况下英国仍然应该参加东西方会谈。
    英国报界对艾森豪威尔给布尔加宁的复信的反应一般是冷淡的。这封复信以及美国政府关于把大量经费用于核军备竞赛的预算咨文，在英国报界引起了不满。
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社伦敦12日讯：英国工党外交问题发言人比万在英国销路最大的报纸“世界新闻报”上发表文章，表示赞成举行东西方最高级会议，他主张接受苏联的“三项建议”，即：立即停止试验氢弹和原子弹两三年；在中欧建立一个无原子武器地区；设立监督哨以防止突然袭击和建立空中摄影监督区。
    比万认为，苏联提出的其他一些建议，例如：关于北大西洋公约组织国家同华沙条约国家签订互不侵犯条约的建议，“可以称为是善意的建议”，但是，比万认为，正是头三项建议具有“不可估价的意义”。他认为，接受这些建议以后，就可能导致大国之间的经常合作，就可能真正需要实行西方国家一直坚持作为裁军条件的那种互相监督。比万还批评了美国国务卿杜勒斯对苏联建议所采取的消极态度。
