Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: According to TASS reports, Soviet aviation designers have already created several types of ornithopters – airplanes that fly by flapping their wings like birds. These ornithopters have various types of wings. One type made by Smirnov is equipped with wings similar to a bird's wings, while the aircraft designed by Rybnikov has wings that resemble insect wings. This type of aircraft is very convenient for short-range flights. In addition, it can take off and land anywhere. The lift of an ornithopter is two to three times greater than that of a regular airplane. The news says that the work of manufacturing ornithopters is being continued by designers of the Ornithopter Flight Committee of the Soviet Voluntary Society for Assistance to the Army, Navy and Air Force.

According to the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" newspaper, the ornithopters currently under research mainly fall into two categories: motorized "flying motorcycles" and "flying bicycles" that utilize human power. The human-powered ornithopter is a machine like a bicycle, which can be operated solely by human power without any other power source. Because industry can produce very light and strong plastics, the manufacture of such "flying bicycles" has become a reality.

"Komsomolskaya Pravda" recently envisioned the following when introducing ornithopters: Perhaps in a few years, this scene will appear on the streets of Moscow: there will be hardly any pedestrians on the streets, and people will be soaring and flying in the sky by flapping their wings.

    人也将像鸟一样地飞翔
    苏联制成多种扑翼机
    据新华社24日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联航空设计师们已经制成了若干种扑翼机——一种像鸟一样靠翅膀搧扑来飞行的飞机。这些扑翼机带有各种各样的机翼。斯米尔诺夫制成的一种装有与鸟翼相似的机翼，而雷勃尼科夫设计的飞机的机翼却像昆虫的翅膀。这种飞机近距离飞行很方便。此外，它可以在任何地方起飞和降落。扑翼机的升力比一般飞机的升力大两倍到三倍。消息说，制造扑翼机的工作正在由苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会扑翼飞行委员会设计师们继续进行中。
    另据苏联“共青团真理报”报道，目前研究的扑翼机主要有两大类：带发动机的“飞行摩托”和利用人的体力的“飞行自行车”。利用体力的扑翼机是一种像自行车一样，只要人力而无需其他动力就能开动的机械。由于工业可以制出十分轻而坚固的塑料，这种“飞行自行车”的制造已经成了现实。
    “共青团真理报”最近在介绍扑翼机时设想道：也许在若干年以后，在莫斯科街头会出现这种景象：街上几乎看不到行人，人们扑着翅膀在天空翱翔飞行。
