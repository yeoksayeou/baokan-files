    "First Be Specialized, Then Be Red" Won't Work
    Gan Xifen
    Recently, among college students and young scientific workers, a discussion is unfolding on the relationship between "professional skills and politics" and "Redness and expertise." It is said that some people see an irreconcilable contradiction between "professional skills" and "politics," and "Redness and expertise," believing that "you can't have both." Thus, they must choose between "giving up fish for bear's paw," abandoning Redness for expertise.
    During the revolutionary war, the problem of contradiction between "Redness" and "expertise" did not arise. At that time, all work and cadres were subordinate to the needs of the war, and each person's work was relatively unfixed. The situation required that a person's job nature could be quickly changed. Now, our country is engaged in an unprecedentedly large-scale socialist construction, and peaceful labor is the current characteristic. In this construction endeavor, the division of labor in various work departments is becoming more and more detailed, and within the same department, it is further divided into smaller categories. Correspondingly, the method of training cadres has also changed, and cadres must be trained according to their specialties. However, due to the peaceful environment, a portion of young intellectuals who have not been tempered by the flames of revolution have developed a fantasy, believing that science is above everything else, that they can enter socialist society solely on the basis of their professional knowledge without arduous political training, and even that they can be superior and enjoy privileges. Thus, the so-called theory of "First Be Specialized, Then Be Red" has emerged.
    The argument of "First Be Specialized, Then Be Red" is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology, and it is contrary to the requirements of socialist construction for intellectuals today.
    Any civilized society requires its own team of experts. The ruling class must cultivate its own experts according to its own requirements and standards to serve its economic foundation. We communists want to build a new society with unprecedented economic and cultural prosperity, and we must also cultivate millions of experts according to our own requirements and standards. Our standards are "both moral and talented" and "both Red and expert." We are advocates of the unity of "Redness" and "expertise." "Expertise" means having professional knowledge in a certain work and scientific field, and "Redness" means political qualities of being loyal to the communist cause and wholeheartedly serving the people. Scientific workers under the socialist system should be communists with various specializations. There is no irreconcilable contradiction in concentrating these two aspects in one person. These two requirements can promote each other and develop in an all-round way, and the growth of communist qualities can further promote and stimulate the development of a person's talents. The slogan "First Be Specialized, Then Be Red" seems to not only acknowledge "expertise" but also acknowledge the need to be "Red," appearing to be very appropriate. But in reality, it puts "expertise" in the first place as an urgent task, while regarding "Redness" as dispensable, pushing it to the distant future, thereby fundamentally negating "Redness."
    This slogan encourages some college students and young scientific workers to develop personal ambitions. The prevailing tendency among them is: if I have expertise and become an expert, I will have "strength." The Communist Party and the People's Government will respect me, promote me, give me status, give me high salaries, and even "invite me to join the Party" and elect me as a people's representative. They think this is how they go from "First Be Specialized, Then Be Red" to "Both Red and Expert."
    This slogan lures young intellectuals to detach themselves from reality, from the masses, and from politics, despising Party and League work and social activities, regarding these as a "burden," as something very easy to do, and that in some distant future evening, when "Redness" is needed, they can take a shortcut and "cram" it.
    This slogan acts as a hypnotic. A portion of young intellectuals already lack confidence in transforming themselves into communists, feel powerless, and feel that the burdens inherited from the old society are dragging them down. "First Be Specialized, Then Be Red" lulls this portion of young people into paralysis, content with being backward, not strictly demanding of themselves, not aspiring to be vibrant revolutionary youths, but instead becoming stragglers of the times.
    One of the arguments of "First Be Specialized, Then Be Red" theorists is that "after being specialized, one will naturally be Red," as if after becoming an expert, one will naturally "become Red." This argument is very dangerous. If the "Redness" referred to here is fame and fortune, and acting as "masters" of the people, then "Redness" is not worth envying. It is not truly Red; it is dyed Red, soaked in Red, but is white or even black at its core. This kind of "Redness" may not even arrive "naturally." The people may not trust such bourgeois individualists, and these people will only end up disgraced and regret it too late. The China Youth Daily's introduction of Qinghua University student He Zheng's degeneration into a rightist is a vivid example.
    If someone's understanding of "after being specialized, one will naturally be Red" is not as bad as the above, and there are truly some innocent fools who attempt to "cram communist ideology one morning and transform themselves into experts who are both Red and expert" after a long period of detachment from politics and being "only specialized but not Red," then they will only meet a tragic end. They take learning Marxism-Leninism too easily. Marxism-Leninism is not dogma, not a cheap thing that can be enjoyed for a lifetime after reading a few books on Marxism. Even just being able to correctly comprehend Marxist thought is not an easy thing. As for linking the principles of Marxism-Leninism with one's own ideological reality and transforming oneself according to Marxism, transforming oneself into a true communist, a member of the working class's intellectuals, is even more difficult. This requires a lifetime of training. The word "training" is very appropriate here. Steelmaking requires high heat of over a thousand degrees, and doesn't training people require the burning of social and ideological flames? To truly refine oneself into "Redness" requires the expenditure of a lifetime of energy. Do not waste your youth; youth is the best time for political and ideological training. When you get older, your thinking easily becomes rigid, and you are slower to accept new ideas and new things. How can you "naturally become Red?" People are not apples; they don't naturally turn Red in autumn. The transformation of people into Redness requires training from youth. Only through a thousand hammers and hundred refinements can one become truly strong steel.
    "First Be Specialized, Then Be Red" theorists have this saying: This theory is not our original creation, but there are precedents to follow. Didn't many famous scientists and professors before liberation become socialist Red experts now? We can follow this path and there is nothing wrong with it. This is called using the wrong allusion or looking at the wrong "almanac." The key to the problem is: are people looking forward or looking backward? Looking forward means making new efforts under new historical conditions; looking backward means retreating to the old path of intellectuals in old China. In old China, science and communism were severed by the reactionary rulers. Professors had to risk their lives to approach communism. Their own social experiences, the bourgeois education they received, their own ideological characteristics, and their isolation from the working people meant that many of them not only had a considerable distance from communism, but were even in contradiction with it. After the victory of the Chinese revolution, the Chinese Communist Party and the people's regime helped the old intellectuals carry out ideological remolding. Many people experienced a painful process before understanding communism, this greatest ideal of mankind, and put it into practice, gradually becoming Marxists. A small number of people even joined the Party. For them, the road to communism was circuitous, tortuous, and painful. Their previous "only specialized but not Red" had various reasons. Their current "both Red and expert" is the attainment of new life. Why should young people who grew up under the socialist system yearn for such a road that is not worth cherishing? Our social system today has all the conditions to guarantee young people the freedom to study Marxism, the freedom to transform themselves into communist fighters, and the freedom to grow into Red experts. Why should we go backwards? Frankly speaking, some of our young people yearn for the path taken by the old intellectuals only because they admire the social status of a few of them today, and pay little attention to their ideological communization; they only pay attention to the famous scientists and professors who are "First Be Specialized, Then Be Red," and pay no attention to the experts who are still in a state of ideological backwardness and intermediate state, whose numbers are much larger. They are far from being called "First Be Specialized, Then Be Red," and they have not yet completed the road of ideological remolding. Of course, some of our young people have not even thought about the roots that gave rise to bourgeois rightists. Many of the rightists were once "experts." They did not "naturally become Red," but became darker and darker. It can be seen that attempting to use the path of the old intellectuals to prove that the "First Be Specialized, Then Be Red" theory is groundless.
    In short, "Redness" is a matter of our world view and outlook on life. Whether you are studying natural science, or studying social science, or doing any work, this is a problem that must be solved, otherwise you will lose your political direction. On the other hand, "expertise" is also something everyone should strive for. We cannot be empty politicians.

### “先专后红”是行不通的

    “先专后红”是行不通的
    甘惜分
    最近在高等学校学生和青年科学工作者中间，正展开关于“业务与政治”、“红与专”的关系问题的讨论，据说有些人看“业务”与“政治”、“红与专”有着不可解决的矛盾，“二者不可得兼”，于是只有“舍鱼而取熊掌”，舍红而取专。
    我们在革命战争的时候，不发生“红”与“专”矛盾的问题，那时一切工作和干部都服从战争的需要，每个人的工作都相对地不是很固定的，形势需要就能迅速改变一个人的工作性质。现在我国正在从事前所未有的规模巨大的社会主义建设，和平劳动是当前的特点。在这个建设事业中，各个工作部门的分工越来越细，在同一部门之中，又分成更为细小的门类。与此相适应，培养干部的方法也有了变化，必须按专业来培养干部。但是，由于处在和平环境，一部分没有受过革命烈火锻炼的青年知识分子中，便发生了一种幻想，以为科学高于一切，以为只凭自己的专业知识，无须艰苦的政治锻炼就可以进入社会主义社会，甚至以为可以高人一等，享受特权。于是就出现了所谓“先专后红”的理论。
    “先专后红”这个论调，乃是资产阶级思想的表现，它和今天社会主义建设对知识分子的要求是相违背的。
    任何一个文明的社会，都要求有它自己的专家队伍，统治阶级都要按照自己的要求和标准来培植自己的专家，以使他们为自己的经济基础服务。我们共产主义者要建立一个经济文化空前繁荣的新社会，我们也要按自己的要求和标准来培植千百万个专家，我们的标准就是“德才兼备”“又红又专”。我们是“红”与“专”的统一论者。“专”就是具有某项工作和科学门类的专业知识，“红”就是忠于共产主义事业、全心全意为人民服务的政治品质。社会主义制度下的科学工作者应当是具有各种专长的共产主义者。在一个人的身上，集中这两方面的特点，并没有不可解决的矛盾。这两种要求是可以互相促进和全面发展的，而且共产主义品质的成长更可以推动和刺激一个人的才能的发展。“先专后红”的口号，看起来不仅承认“专”，也承认要“红”，好像是非常妥贴的样子。但是实际上，它把“专”摆在首位，作为迫切的任务，而把“红”看作可有可无，推到遥远的将来，从而根本否定“红”。
    这个口号鼓励一些大学生和青年科学工作者发展个人野心。在他们之中流行的倾向是：我有了专长，成了专家，我就有了“实力”，共产党和人民政府就会尊重我，抬举我，给我地位，给我高薪，甚至“请我入党”，选我当人民代表。他们以为这就是由“先专后红”走到了“又专又红”。
    这个口号引诱青年知识分子脱离实际、脱离群众、脱离政治，轻视党团工作和社会活动，把这些看成是一种“负担”，看成是非常轻而易举的事情，在遥远的将来的某一个黄昏，需要“红”的时候，钻空子“补习”一下就行。
    这个口号起一种催眠的作用。有一部分青年知识分子，本来就对于把自己锻炼成一个共产主义者缺乏信心，感到无力，感到从旧社会因袭的负担在拖着自己。“先专后红”就使这部分青年陷于麻痹，安于落后，不严格要求自己，不是立志做一个富有朝气的革命青年，而是做一个时代的落伍者。
    “先专后红”论者的论点之一，是“先专而后自然红”，似乎成了专家之后，就会自然而然“红”起来。这个论点是非常危险的。如果这里所指的“红”，是名利，是充当人民的“老爷”，那么“红”是不值得羡慕的，它并非真红，它是染红，浸红，骨子里还是白的，甚至发黑。这种“红”也未必能够“自然”到来，人民未必信任这样的资产阶级个人主义者，这些人只会弄得身败名裂，悔之晚矣。中国青年报上介绍清华大学的学生何正堕落成右派就是一个生动的例子。
    如果有人对“先专而后自然红”的理解不是上述那么恶劣，而真有这样一些天真无邪的呆子，他们企图在长期脱离政治之后，在“只专不红”之后，还能在一个早晨把“共产主义思想补习一下，就能使自己变成又专又红的专家”，那也只会得到悲惨的下场。他们把学好马克思列宁主义看得太容易了。马克思列宁主义不是教条，不是在念完几本马克思主义的书籍之后就可以躺在上面受用一辈子的便宜事情，单是稍能正确的领会马克思主义的思想已经不是容易的事情了。至于说到把马克思列宁主义的原理和自己的思想实际联系起来，按照马克思主义来改造自己，把自己锻炼成一个真正的共产主义者，一个工人阶级的知识分子，就更不容易了，这是需要锻炼一辈子的事情。“锻炼”两字，在这里很恰当。炼钢要一千多度的高热，锻炼人又何尝不要社会烈火和思想烈火的燃烧。把自己真正炼“红”，这是必须付出毕生精力的。千万不要浪费青年时光，青年时期正是政治思想锻炼的好时候。等到年纪大了，思想容易陷于僵化，接受新思想新事物较慢，怎能够“自然红”起来呢？人不是苹果，到了秋天，就自然变红。人之变红，需要从青年时代就锻炼起。只有经过千锤百炼，才能变成真正的钢材。
    “先专后红”论者有这样一种说法：这个理论并非我等独创，而是有先例可循，解放前的许多著名科学家和名教授现在不是成了社会主义的红色专家吗？吾人循此前进，未为不可。这叫做用错了典故或看错了“黄历”。问题的关键在于：人们是往前看呢？还是往后看。往前看，就要在新的历史条件下作出新的努力；往后看，就是退回到旧中国知识分子的老路上去。在旧中国，科学与共产主义是被反动统治割裂了的，教授们要冒生命危险来接近共产主义。他们本身的社会经历，所受的资产阶级教育，自己的思想特点以及和劳动人民的隔绝，使他们中间许多人和共产主义不仅有相当距离，甚至正相矛盾。中国革命胜利之后，中国共产党和劳动人民的政权帮助旧知识分子进行思想改造，许多人经历了一段痛苦的过程，才了解了共产主义这个人类最伟大的理想，并且身体力行，逐渐成了马克思主义者，有少数人甚至参加了党。对他们来说，达到共产主义的道路是迂回的、曲折的、痛苦的。他们以前“只专不红”是有各种原因的，现在“又红又专”是获致了新生。为什么我们在社会主义社会制度下成长的青年，还要向往这样一条并不值得留恋的道路呢？我们今天的社会制度有一切条件保证青年有学习马克思主义的自由，有把自己锻炼成共产主义战士的自由，有成长为红色专家的自由，为什么还要走回头路呢？坦率的说，我们有些青年之所以向往旧知识分子所走的道路，也只是羡慕他们中间少数人今天的社会地位，而不大注意他们思想上的共产主义化；只注意了“先专后红”的名科学家和教授，而毫不注意人数多得多的仍然处于思想落后状态和中间状态的专家们，他们还远远不能称为“先专后红”，他们还没有走完那条思想改造的道路。我们的某些青年，当然更没有想到产生资产阶级右派的根源，右派中的许多人也曾经是“专家”，他们并没有“自然红”反而越来越黑了。可见，企图用旧知识分子的道路来证明“先专后红”论是毫无根据的。
    总之，“红”是我们每个人的世界观和人生观问题。无论你研究自然科学，或研究社会科学，或干什么工作，都是要解决的问题，否则便会迷失政治方向。另一方面，“专”也是大家要努力的，我们不能做一个空头的政治家。
