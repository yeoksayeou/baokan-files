A note:

    The British Atomic Energy Authority announced on the 24th that they had made some achievements in thermonuclear reaction research. News from London said that it was quite a hassle just to announce this. Because the United States, having lost face in the outer space race, was unwilling to see Britain being stronger than it in thermonuclear reaction research and had exerted pressure to prevent the announcement.

    Harnessing the power of the hydrogen bomb for peaceful purposes is a good thing. Soviet scientists have made considerable progress in this area and generously share their research findings with their foreign counterparts. British scientists have said that their progress is due to the contributions of Soviet scientists.

    By comparison, it can be seen that the United States, even in the field of scientific research, is exhibiting an attitude of being the sole and supreme overlord towards its allies.

    科学“霸主”
    英国原子能委员会24日宣布他们在热核反应研究方面取得一些成就。伦敦的消息说，单单是宣布这件事就很费周折。因为，在外层空间竞赛中丢尽了脸的美国不愿看到英国在热核反应研究方面比它强，曾施加压力，阻止宣布。
    把氢弹动力用于和平，是件好事。苏联科学家在这一方面已有长足进展，并毫不吝惜地把研究心得告诉他国同行。英国科学家就说，他们的进展有苏联科学家的功绩。
    对比之下就可以看出，美国对它的盟国，即使在科学研究领域，也在施展唯我独尊的霸主作风。
