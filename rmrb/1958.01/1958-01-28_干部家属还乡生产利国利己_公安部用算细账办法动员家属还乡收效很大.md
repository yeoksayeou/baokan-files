Xinhua News Agency, January 27th—The work of mobilizing family members of staff to return to their hometowns for labor and production, recently carried out by the Ministry of Public Security, has basically concluded. In this work, the Ministry of Public Security focused on ideological mobilization and used the method of detailed accounting to educate cadres and their families, enabling the family members to return to the countryside to participate in agricultural production happily. Currently, 695 family members of the Ministry of Public Security have signed up to return to their hometowns for labor and production, of which 63 have already returned to the countryside, 271 will return around the Spring Festival, and the rest are actively creating conditions to strive to return home as soon as possible.

Before mobilizing family members to return to their hometowns, the Ministry of Public Security conducted extensive investigation and research work, clarifying the situation of the staff’s family members and the possible problems they might encounter upon returning home, basically ensuring a clear understanding and preparing for the mobilization work.

When the Ministry of Public Security began this work, a vice minister gave a mobilization report to all staff, pointing out the great revolutionary significance of family members returning to their hometowns for labor and production, and calling on them to learn from the officers and their families of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. After the overall mobilization, leaders at all levels repeatedly mobilized within their units and launched and organized all staff to discuss the significance of family members returning to their hometowns for labor and production, in conjunction with studying the "Instructions on Preventing the Blind Outflow of Rural Population" issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the People's Daily editorial "Preventing the Blind Outflow of Rural Population." Through extensive discussions, the cadres were educated. The cadres enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and expressed their determination on big-character posters and in group meetings to mobilize their family members to return to their hometowns for labor and production. Within three days, 305 family members had signed up. Some cadres who had originally planned to bring their family members from the countryside to live in Beijing now also guaranteed not to bring them. Some leading cadres took the lead in mobilizing their family members to return home, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of family members to return. Many cadres were also able to patiently and meticulously persuade and mobilize their family members, breaking down their ideological concerns and enabling them to return home happily.

In the ideological work of mobilizing staff members' families to return to their hometowns, the Ministry of Public Security, in addition to focusing on mobilizing the masses to discuss and debate the great political significance of family members returning to their hometowns and fully enlightening the masses' consciousness, also adopted the method of detailed accounting, which proved to be very effective. They calculated two accounts for the masses: one was the account of the state's burden. First, starting from the family members' housing. The Ministry of Public Security had 1,374 unemployed family members living in Beijing. With an average of 4 square meters of housing per person, this required nearly 5,500 square meters, and building so much housing would cost 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Second, for every additional person in the city, the state had to spend 558 to 695 yuan on welfare facilities and municipal engineering construction. The 1,374 people increased the state's expenditure by 766,600 to 954,930 yuan; among the 1,374 family members, 380 had the ability to work. After participating in agricultural production, each person could produce 400 jin of grain per year, totaling 152,000 jin of grain for the state. If they remained in the city, not only could they not produce grain for the state, but the state would have to bear 136,800 jin of grain per year (calculated at 360 jin per person). The second account was a universal calculation of personal economic accounts. For example, one cadre brought seven family members from his rural hometown to live in Beijing. His monthly salary income was 124 yuan, which was not enough for living expenses, and the public had to subsidize him 25 yuan per month. This cadre initially did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of family members returning to their hometowns, so the leadership helped him calculate a detailed account. As a result of the calculation, the cadre sent the seven family members back to the countryside, where the average living expenses per person per month were only 10 yuan, so only 70 yuan was enough for them to live well, and there was no need for public subsidies, and there was even a monthly surplus; if they continued to live in Beijing, not only would the individual economic burden be heavier, but the public would also have to provide subsidies, and it would be difficult to improve their lives. After calculating the detailed account, this cadre realized that family members returning to their hometowns was beneficial to the country, the family, and the individual, so he happily accepted everyone's opinions and decided to send his family members back to the countryside. Many cadres in the Ministry of Public Security actively mobilized their family members to return to their hometowns after calculating the detailed account.

The ideological work of mobilizing family members of the Ministry of Public Security to return to their hometowns for production has penetrated into the family members. In addition to emphasizing that cadres should persuade and educate their family members and that each unit should be responsible for ideological mobilization, the rectification leading group of the Ministry of Public Security also specially selected 17 female cadres as propagandists, divided the areas according to the distribution of family members' dormitories, and held family member forums. At the meeting, in addition to generally explaining the various benefits of family members returning to their hometowns, the propagandists also focused on explaining and persuading family members in response to their ideological concerns. As a result, many family members signed up on the spot at each family member forum. After holding family member forums, the family members' understanding of returning to their hometowns was further corrected, various ideological concerns were eliminated, and a trend of glory in signing up to return to their hometowns to work was formed among family members.

Leaders at all levels and the vast number of cadres of the Ministry of Public Security gave great care to the family members who had signed up to return to their hometowns and earnestly helped them solve specific difficulties. Many family members who returned home expressed that they would respond to everyone's care for them with practical actions of actively participating in production.

### 干部家属还乡生产利国利己  公安部用算细账办法动员家属还乡收效很大

    干部家属还乡生产利国利己
    公安部用算细账办法动员家属还乡收效很大
    新华社27日讯　公安部最近进行的动员工作人员家属还乡劳动生产的工作已经基本结束。公安部在这一工作中，抓紧了思想动员，并用算细账的办法教育了干部和家属，使家属愉快地回乡参加农业生产。现在公安部报名还乡劳动生产的家属有六百九十五人，其中有六十三人已回到了农村，有二百七十一人将在春节前后回农村，其余也正在积极创造条件，力争早日回乡。
    在动员家属还乡以前，公安部曾普遍进行调查研究工作，摸清工作人员家属的情况，以及家属回乡可能遇到的问题，基本上做到心中有数，为开展动员家属还乡工作做好了准备。
    公安部在开始进行这一工作时，由一位副部长向全体工作人员做了动员报告，指出家属还乡劳动生产的重大革命意义，并号召向中国人民解放军军官及其家属学习。在全部动员以后，各级领导又在本单位反复地作了动员，并发动和组织全体工作人员结合学习中共中央、国务院“关于制止农村人口盲目外流的指示”和人民日报“制止农村人口盲目外流”等有关社论，讨论了家属还乡劳动生产的意义。通过广泛的讨论，教育了干部。干部们热烈地响应党的号召，纷纷在大字报上和小组会上表示决心，要动员自己的家属还乡劳动生产。在三天之内就有三百零五名家属报了名。有一些干部原计划把在乡的家属接来北京居住，现在也保证不接来。还有一些领导干部带头动员自己的家属回乡，大大地鼓舞了家属回乡的热情。许多干部还能耐心地细致地对自己的家属进行说服动员工作，打破家属的思想顾虑，使家属愉快回乡。
    公安部在动员工作人员家属还乡的思想工作中，除了着重发动群众讨论、辩论家属还乡的重大政治意义，充分启发群众的自觉以外，还采取了算细账的方法，收效颇大。他们向群众算了两笔账：一笔是算国家负担的账。首先从家属的住房算起。公安部在北京居住的没有工作的家属共一千三百七十四人。以每人平均占用四平方公尺房屋，要近五千五百平方公尺，而修盖这样多的房屋需要三、四十万元。其次，城市多一口人，国家就要多支出福利设施和市政工程建设的费用五百五十八到六百九十五元，一千三百七十四人就给国家增加经费开支七十六万六千六百到九十五万四千九百三十元；在一千三百七十四名家属中有劳动能力的三百八十人，他们参加农业生产后，每人每年可生产四百斤粮食，合计起来可以为国家生产十五万二千斤粮食，假若仍在城市里，不仅不能为国家生产粮食，而且每年还要国家负担十三万六千八百斤粮食（以每人三百六十斤计算）。第二笔是普遍地算个人经济账。如某干部将原住农村的七口人接来北京居住，每月工资收入一百二十四元，不够生活所需，每月还要公家补助二十五元。这个干部开始时对家属还乡的意义认识不足，领导上就帮助他算细账，算的结果，这个干部将七口人送回农村，每人每月生活费平均只要十元，只要七十元就可以生活得很好，也不要公家补助，而且每月还有节余；如果仍住在北京，不仅个人经济负担较重，公家还要给予补助，生活也很难改善。经过算细账，这个干部认识到家属还乡既有利于国家，也有利于家庭和个人，于是愉快地接受大家的意见，决定把家属送回农村。公安部有不少干部经过算细账后，都积极地动员自己的家属还乡。
    公安部动员家属还乡生产的思想工作已经深入到家属中去。公安部整风领导小组除强调干部对自己家属进行说服教育以及各单位负责进行思想动员外，还专门抽调了十七名女干部做宣传员，根据家属宿舍分布情况，划分区域召开家属座谈会。宣传员在会上除一般地讲解家属还乡的种种好处外，还着重地针对家属的思想顾虑进行解释和说服教育，因而在每个家属座谈会上都有不少家属当场报名还乡。经过召开家属座谈会以后，进一步端正了家属们对还乡的认识，消除了种种思想顾虑，从而在家属中形成了报名还乡劳动光荣的风气。
    公安部各级领导和广大干部对已报名的还乡家属给予了极大的关怀，切实地帮助他们解决具体困难。许多回乡的家属都表示要以积极参加生产的实际行动，回答大家对他们的关怀。
