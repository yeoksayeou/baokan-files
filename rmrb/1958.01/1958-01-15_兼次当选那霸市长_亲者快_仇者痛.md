Reported Comprehensively by Our Newspaper: Tokyo News: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 13th regarding Kaneshi Saichi's election as Mayor of Naha, saying that Kaneshi's election is a victory for all Japanese people. The Japanese Communist Party hopes that Kaneshi Saichi, like the former Mayor of Naha, Kamejiro Senaga, will never succumb to any persecution from the enemy.

Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, said in a statement that this election signifies the final reckoning of the Okinawan people's long-term struggle against American military rule. The United States should immediately return Okinawa to Japan.

Secretary-General of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Shojiro Kawashima, advocated that the U.S. military authorities and the U.S. government "consider the feelings of the Naha citizens and the Okinawan people from a broader perspective."

According to a Washington report: The U.S. government is very uneasy about Kaneshi Saichi's election as Mayor of Naha. Some American newspapers believe that the election result of the Naha Mayor means the failure of the United States' administration of Okinawa Island. The U.S. military and administrative authorities also had to admit that this was not the result of organized communist activity, but rather due to the impact of driving away former Mayor Kamejiro Senaga and the residents' dissatisfaction with the continued long-term occupation of Okinawa Island by the United States.

    兼次当选那霸市长
    亲者快　仇者痛
    本报综合报道　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会13日就兼次佐一当选为那霸市长一事发表声明说，兼次的当选是全日本人民的胜利。日本共产党希望兼次佐一能够像前任那霸市长濑长龟次郎一样，对敌人的任何迫害绝不屈服。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎发表谈话说，这次选举意味着冲绳人民长期对美国军事统治进行的斗争的总决算。美国应该立刻把冲绳交还日本。
    执政的自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎主张美军当局和美国政府“从更大的方面着眼来考虑那霸市民和冲绳人民的心情”。
    另据华盛顿消息：美国政府对兼次佐一当选那霸市长感到十分不安。一些美国报纸认为，那霸市长的选举结果意味着美国对冲绳岛的管理的失败。美国军事和行政当局也不得不承认这并不是有组织的共产党的活动的结果，而是由于赶走前市长濑长龟次郎的影响和居民不满美国继续长期占领冲绳岛的结果。（附图片）
