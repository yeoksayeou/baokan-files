    Spiritual Food Must Also Go to the Countryside and Mountains
    Zhong Huai
    Last December, when Premier Zhou Enlai visited cadres working in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs, he asked them: Do you read newspapers and books?
    This question shows that the leaders of the Party and the country understand the needs of intellectuals very well. Many intellectuals have this experience: they feel bored and can't stand it if they don't read the newspaper for a day. They call this "spiritual food," which is not an exaggeration at all. Of course, the spiritual food that intellectuals need is not only newspapers, but also magazines, books, various learning materials, and, as far as possible, appropriate cultural entertainment.
    Currently, tens of thousands of cadres (most of whom are intellectuals) are going to the countryside and mountains. How to meet their need for spiritual food is a problem that cannot be ignored. If this problem is solved well, the cadres who are sent down will be more energetic and in a better mood. They will not feel that they are cut off from the world and that life is monotonous in the countryside. Some ideological problems that may arise in the process of changing their lifestyle and participating in physical labor will also be better resolved with the help of newspapers and books. They will not only transform their thoughts and feelings through productive labor, but also continuously improve themselves politically and culturally through learning.
    If this problem is solved well, it can also send spiritual food to the broad masses of farmers through the intellectuals who go to the countryside and mountains. Cadres go to the countryside, on the one hand, to train and transform themselves, and on the other hand, to shoulder the mission of bringing culture to the countryside. Some farmers in some places regard the work assignments of the cadres who are sent down as "distributing culture." Some farmers immediately set up reading groups when they saw the cadres who were sent down arrive. Yes, in terms of bringing culture to the countryside, the cadres who are sent down can do many things: help farmers read newspapers, become literate, and read books, publicize current events and policies to farmers, introduce agricultural scientific knowledge, carry out hygiene campaigns with farmers, carry out cultural and entertainment activities... To do this, the cadres who are sent down themselves must have access to the necessary spiritual food.
    Some leading organs and some units with cadres sent down have already paid attention to solving this problem. For example, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has issued a notice requiring post and telecommunications bureaus across the country to cooperate with the sending down of cadres and do a good job in the distribution of newspapers and periodicals in rural areas. In order to meet the learning needs of cadres in the countryside, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture has decided to strengthen the work of libraries in the suburbs. They recently transferred 40 library cadres, carrying nearly 20,000 books, to assist suburban libraries in establishing 84 mobile library stations in agricultural cooperatives and production teams to carry out mobile library work. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is also drafting a plan to enable cadres who are sent down to regularly hear various important reports. The Party Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has also timely supplied its cadres who are sent down with learning materials on political and ideological education and rural work, as well as League publications.
    The above-mentioned practices have been welcomed by the cadres who are sent down and have greatly encouraged them spiritually. It is hoped that the news, publishing, distribution, literary and art departments, and all relevant departments will pay attention to this issue, and everyone will work together to take various feasible measures to send as much spiritual food as possible to the countryside and mountains. It is hoped that local party committees and all units with cadres sent down will pay attention to their spiritual life and learning situation while paying attention to the labor and production of the cadres sent down, help them solve difficulties, and meet their reasonable requirements in this regard as much as possible.

    精神食粮也要下乡上山
    钟怀
    去年12月，周恩来总理在上海郊区农村探望下放干部的时候，问他们：看不看书报？
    这一问，表明党和国家的领导人对知识分子的需要是了解得很深的。许多知识分子都有这个经验：一天不看报，就闷的慌，受不了。他们把这称作“精神食粮”，一点也不夸张。当然，知识分子需要的精神食粮，不止是报纸，还有杂志、书籍、各种学习材料，而且在可能范围内，还要有适当的文化娱乐。
    目前成千成万的干部（他们之中绝大部分是知识分子）正在下乡上山。如何满足他们对精神食粮的需要，是一个不容忽视的问题。这个问题解决得好，下放干部就会更加精神饱满，心情愉快。他们将不会感到在农村里耳目蔽塞，生活单调。他们在改变生活方式和参加体力劳动过程中可能产生的一些思想问题，也将因为报刊、书籍的帮助，而更好地得到解决。他们将不仅从生产劳动中改造自己的思想感情，也将通过学习在政治上和文化上不断地提高自己。
    这个问题解决得好，还可以通过下乡上山的知识分子，把精神食粮送给广大农民。干部下乡，一方面固然是锻炼和改造自己，另一方面，还担负着文化下乡的使命。有的地方的农民，把下放干部的工作分配看成“分配文化”。有些农民看见下放干部一到，马上成立了读报组。是的，在文化下乡方面，下放干部可做的事情很多：帮助农民读报、识字、看书，向农民宣传时事政策、介绍农业科学知识，同农民一起搞卫生运动、搞文化娱乐活动……。而要做到这些，下放干部本身就要得到必要的精神食粮。
    现在有些领导机关、有些有干部下放的单位，已经注意解决这个问题。例如邮电部已发出通知，要求全国邮电局配合干部下放，做好农村的报刊发行工作。上海市文化局为了满足下乡干部的学习需要，决定加强郊区的图书馆工作，他们最近抽调了四十名图书馆干部，携带了近两万册图书，协助郊区图书馆在农业社和生产队里建立起八十四个图书流动站，开展图书流动工作。中共上海市委并在拟定计划，要使下放干部能够经常听到各种重要的报告。共青团中央机关党委会也为本机关下放干部及时供应了政治思想教育和有关农村工作的学习材料，以及团的刊物。
    上述这些做法，都受到了下放干部的欢迎，并使他们在精神上受到很大的鼓舞。希望新闻、出版、发行部门、文艺部门和一切有关部门都来注意这个问题，大家共同努力，采取各种可行的办法，把尽可能多的精神食粮送下乡去、送上山去。希望各地党委和一切有干部下放的单位，在关心下放干部劳动生产情况的同时，关心他们的精神生活和学习情况，帮助他们解决困难，尽可能满足他们这方面的合理要求。（附图片）
