    Resistance Strain Gauge
    The Tianjin Electronic Instrument Factory has successfully trial-produced a resistance strain gauge.
    This instrument can be used to measure the structural stress of various projects and the bearing weight of bridges. If some of its parts are changed, it can also be used to measure water flow velocity and the bearing pressure of construction sites. Xinhua News Agency reporter Tian Ming photographed it.
    Ten-Ton Boom Crane
    The domestically produced ten-ton boom crane manufactured for the construction of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station dam has been completed at the state-owned Fengman Machinery Factory.
    The lifting capacity of this crane is from ten tons to thirty tons.
    The ten-ton boom crane has a fast lifting speed and runs smoothly on the track. It can also transport lifted items to a distance of 37 meters or a height of 36.5 meters, making it particularly suitable for building hydropower station dams.
    The Fengman Machinery Factory plans to produce ten to twenty boom cranes this year to support hydropower construction. (According to Xinhua News Agency report) (Attached picture)

    电阻应变仪
    天津电子仪器厂试制电阻变应仪成功。
    这种仪器可以用来测量各项工程的结构应力和桥梁的承载重量。如把它某些部件加以改变，还可用来测量水流速度，测量工地承压力。新华社记者田　明摄
  十吨臂式起重机
    为新安江水电站建筑拦河坝制造的国产十吨臂式起重机已经在国营丰满机械厂制成。
    这台起重机起重能力是十吨到三十吨。
    十吨臂式起重机升降速度快，在轨道上行走平稳，而且可以把起重物品送到三十七公尺远或三十六点五公尺高的地方，特别适用于建筑水电站拦河坝。
    丰满机械厂今年计划生产十台到二十台臂式起重机，支援水电建设。　（据新华社讯）（附图片）
