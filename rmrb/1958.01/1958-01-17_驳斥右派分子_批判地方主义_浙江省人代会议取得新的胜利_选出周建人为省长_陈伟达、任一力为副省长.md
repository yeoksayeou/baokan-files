Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 16th: The Sixth Session of the First Zhejiang Provincial People's Congress concluded in Hangzhou on the 15th. The meeting elected Zhou Jianren as Governor of Zhejiang Province, Chen Weida and Ren Yili as Vice Governors of Zhejiang Province; supplemented the election of Fang Qide and twelve others as members of the Provincial People's Committee; supplemented the election of Wu Xian, Yu Zhongwu, Yu Zuochen, Xu Chiwen, Tang Xunze, Dong Yumo, Pan Tianshou, Huo Shilian and eight others as representatives to the First National People's Congress.

　　During the twenty-day meeting, two hundred and twenty-six representatives and observers spoke at the congress and in group meetings, fully exposing and refuting the serious crimes of the rightists Sha Wenhan, Yang Siyi, and Li Shihao against the Party and socialism. Qiu Qinghua, a representative to the National People's Congress, specifically exposed at the meeting that during their attendance at the National People's Congress meeting in Beijing in July of last year, Sha Wenhan and Yang Siyi tried every means to support and shield the rightists Li Shihao and Song Yunbin, pointing out that Sha and Yang, in their capacity as the leader and deputy leader of the Zhejiang delegation, arrogantly resisted the central authorities' policies and the instructions of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, seriously undermining the anti-rightist struggle.

    The representatives pointed out that the fact that this meeting was able to remove Sha and Yang from their positions as governor and vice-governor fully demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the socialist political system. The representatives unanimously believed that Sha Wenhan and Yang Siyi had completely degenerated into agents of the bourgeoisie within the Party, and that removing them from their positions as governor and vice-governor was a major victory for the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts for the people of Zhejiang Province, and was fully in line with the will and interests of the people of the province.

    Localism was also criticized at this meeting.

    All the representatives enthusiastically discussed the "Implementation of the Zhejiang Province's 1957 Economic Plan, the Draft 1958 Economic Plan, and the Preliminary Plan for a Ten-Year Vision of Economic Development."

    Zhou Jianren delivered a closing speech at the meeting, pointing out that this meeting was a triumphant gathering of the anti-rightist struggle on all fronts in the province, and also a mobilization meeting to promote the people of the province to improve technology, transform nature, and march towards a high tide of production. The victory of the anti-rightist struggle achieved at the meeting was enormous, fully demonstrating that the socialist road and the leadership of the Communist Party cannot be shaken in the slightest, and powerfully proving the unparalleled superiority of the socialist democratic system.

    驳斥右派分子　批判地方主义
    浙江省人代会议取得新的胜利
    选出周建人为省长　陈伟达、任一力为副省长
    据新华社杭州16日电　浙江省第一届人民代表大会第六次会议15日在杭州闭幕。会议选举周建人为浙江省省长，陈伟达、任一力为浙江省副省长；补选方琦德等十二人为省人民委员会委员；补选吴宪、俞仲武、俞佐宸、徐赤文、唐巽泽、董聿茂、潘天寿、霍士廉等八人为第一届全国人民代表大会代表。
  　在二十天的会议期间，先后有二百二十六名代表和列席人员在大会、小组会上发言，充分地揭露和驳斥了右派分子沙文汉、杨思一、李士豪等人的反党反社会主义的严重罪行。全国人民代表大会代表丘清华在会上具体地揭露了沙文汉、杨思一去年7月在北京出席全国人民代表大会会议期间，千方百计地支持、包庇右派分子李士豪、宋云彬的罪行，指出沙、杨当时以浙江代表小组正、副组长身份，狂妄地抗拒中央的方针和中共浙江省委的指示，严重地破坏了反右派斗争。
    代表们指出，这次会议能够罢免沙、杨的省长、副省长职务，就充分说明了社会主义政治制度的无比优越性。代表们一致认为沙文汉、杨思一已经完全堕落为资产阶级在党内的代理人，罢免他们的省长、副省长职务是浙江全省人民在政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命的重大胜利，是完全符合全省人民的意志和利益的。
    这次会议上还批判了地方主义。
    全体代表热烈讨论了“浙江省1957年度经济计划执行情况、1958年度经济计划草案和经济发展十年远景初步规划”。
    周建人在会上致闭幕词，他指出：这次会议是全省各个战线反右派斗争胜利的会师大会，又是推动全省人民改进技术、改造自然、向生产高潮进军的誓师大会。会议取得的反右派斗争的胜利是巨大的，充分地说明了走社会主义道路和共产党的领导是丝毫不能动摇的，有力地证明了社会主义民主制度的无比优越性。
