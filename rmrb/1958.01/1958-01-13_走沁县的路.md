    Taking the Road of Qin County
    Wang Pu
    After reading the article "A New Contradiction and a Way to Resolve It," I felt enlightened. Qin County's experience in running local industries is truly vivid and rich. Some of the problems and contradictions that local industries are generally finding difficult to solve are readily resolved there. One contradiction – agriculture urgently requires the supply of more, more suitable, and cheaper water conservancy equipment, chemical fertilizers, and agricultural machinery, but industry cannot keep up. The comrades in Qin County have found a practical and effective way to solve this contradiction. Another contradiction – local industries need to develop greatly, but the state's funds are insufficient. They have also found a wonderful way to solve this contradiction. These experiences of Qin County are experiences in solving some fundamental problems in the current development of agriculture and local industries, and have great universal significance.
    There is no doubt that the comrades in Qin County are a group of promoters. There are no contradictions that cannot be resolved, and no difficulties that cannot be overcome. If the comrades in Qin County did not have this heroic spirit of facing contradictions squarely and stepping forward to meet difficulties, they would not be able to accomplish this undertaking.
    However, correct thinking alone cannot solve the problem. To solve the problem, there must also be correct methods.
    The method adopted by the comrades in Qin County is a revolutionary method, and at the same time a pragmatic method. If what they have done had not already become a reality, it would sound quite absurd at first hearing. People have only heard of state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private enterprises, but they have never heard of factories jointly operated by the state, handicraft cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives. People have only heard of egg factories, fertilizer factories, printing factories, oil extraction factories, and machine factories, but they have never heard of these miscellaneous and unrelated industries coexisting in one factory. According to common sense, small county-run factories can only do extremely simple and crude work. For county-run factories to even think of making high-pressure sluice gates, drilling machines, and hydraulic instruments is simply wishful thinking and overestimation of their capabilities! In a word, Qin County's practices are all "abnormal." However, it is precisely this "abnormality," this method of breaking with convention and boldly innovating, that we need. If we are to build China, which is both poor and blank, into a powerful country with modern industry and modern agriculture in the next fifteen years or so, and if we are to catch up with Britain, which has been ahead of us for more than a hundred years, in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years, this would be "abnormal" to the old world. We are doing a "abnormal" revolutionary undertaking, and we need to adopt "abnormal" revolutionary methods.
    However, Qin County's "abnormal" practices are not reckless or rash. They were explored and created step by step according to the specific needs and conditions of the local area, and are "native." Because they come from reality, they stand firm and work well. Because they come from reality, their wisdom is endless and their methods are endless.
    Now, the comrades in various places generally do not lack enthusiasm. Everyone is willing to quickly meet the demands put forward by agriculture, and is willing to quickly develop local industries. However, the methods and paths to achieve this goal have not yet been found by everyone. Many comrades are still looking at big factories and thinking about new constructions, and feel that only big factories and new factories can meet the needs of agriculture. They reach out to the state and feel that only the state can give money to develop local industries. Obviously, this plan is not realistic. Relying on this method, no matter how great the enthusiasm, the goal will not be fully achieved.
    The best method is: Take the road of Qin County.

    走沁县的路
    王朴
    读了“一个新的矛盾和解决的途径”一文，耳目为之一新。沁县办地方工业的经验，真是生动而又丰富，当前地方工业普遍感到难于解决的一些问题，一些矛盾，在他们那里都迎刃而解了。一个矛盾——农业急于要求供应又多、又适用、又便宜的水利设备、化学肥料和农业机械，但是工业赶不上去。沁县的同志们找到了切实有效的解决这个矛盾的办法。另一个矛盾——地方工业需要大发展，但是国家资金不足。这个矛盾，也被他们找到了绝妙的解决的途径。沁县的这些经验，是解决当前发展农业和发展地方工业中的一些根本问题的经验，有很大的普遍意义。
    毫无疑问，沁县的同志们是一群促进派。世界上没有解决不了的矛盾，没有克服不了的困难。如果沁县的同志们没有这种正视矛盾、挺身迎接困难的英雄气概，是做不出这番事业的。
    然而，只有正确的思想，还不能解决问题。要解决问题，还必须有正确的方法。
    沁县的同志们所采取的方法，是革命的方法，同时又是实事求是的方法。他们的所做所为，如果不是已经变成现实，乍听起来，会使人觉得相当荒唐。人们只听到过有国营、地方国营、公私合营的工厂，从来没有听到过有什么国家、手工业社、供销社和农业社合营的工厂。人们只听到过打蛋厂、肥料厂、印刷厂、榨油厂、机器厂，从来没有听到过这些杂七杂八各不相关的行业，居然会并存在一个工厂里。按照常情，县营的小工厂，只能做些极其简单粗糙的活。县营工厂居然想做高压水闸、钻探机、水工仪器，岂不是想入非非，自不量力！一句话，沁县的做法都是“反常”的。但是，恰恰是这种“反常”，这种打破陈规、大胆革新的方法，是我们所正需要的方法。我们要在今后十五年左右把又穷又白的中国建成为一个有现代工业和现代农业的强大国家，要在十五年里在主要的工业品的产量上赶上走在我们前面一百多年的英国，这对旧世界说来，就是“反常”的。我们干的是“反常”的革命大事，就需要采用“反常”的革命方法。
    然而，沁县的“反常”的做法，却又不是乱来，不是蛮干。他们是按照当地的具体需要和具体条件，一步一个脚印地摸索、创造出来的，是“土生土长”的。因为是从实际中来，所以就站得稳，行得开。因为是从实际中来，所以他们的智慧就无穷无尽，办法也无穷无尽。
    现在，各个地方的同志，干劲一般可以说是不缺乏的。大家都愿意很快地满足农业所提出的要求，愿意很快地发展地方工业。然而，达到这个目的的方法和道路，却还不是大家都找到了。有不少同志现在还是眼睛看着大工厂，心里想着新建设，觉得只有大厂新厂才能满足农业的要求。他们把手伸向国家，觉得只有国家给钱才能发展地方工业。显然，这种打算是不切合实际的。依靠这种方法，干劲再大，也不会圆满地达到目的。
    最好的方法是：走沁县的路。
