    New Year's Talk on "Drive"
    Ge De
    On New Year's Day, some friends came to visit. After meeting, we naturally exchanged New Year's greetings, and as usual, we also expressed some sentiments about "how quickly this year has gone." However, we all felt that this New Year was truly extraordinary.
    For example, it came from the high tide of rectification. We talked about some sharp and humorous big-character posters; talked about some issues that had been hotly debated; talked about the streamlining of institutions and the transfer of cadres to lower levels; talked about the transformation of leaders' work styles; and also talked about one agency whose rectification was not effective, and its leaders were urged by superiors, saying that if it could not be rectified to 80% before the New Year, they would not be allowed to have a relaxing New Year. As a result, the rectification of this agency became active and progressed rapidly. In short, each had its new atmosphere, and people's spirits were encouraged and agitated by this upsurge.
    Also, our first Five-Year Plan has been successfully completed, and the second Five-Year Plan will begin today; also, we have proposed to catch up with or surpass Britain in about fifteen years, which will also be calculated from today. All of this shows that 1958 will be an extraordinary year, and today is an extraordinary day in this year, and the first day, and these great things will start from this day.
    Therefore, we feel that in these extraordinary years, people should be particularly energetic; to be a "promising Chinese," we must have the "socialist drive" called for by the Party.
    Speaking of socialist drive, we all seem to have some feelings, but we cannot clearly express it, and there is a kind of "it can only be understood but cannot be expressed in words" feeling. So, we turned to talking about what "drive" is.
    Among my friends, one is working in the trade union. He believes that the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions fully demonstrated this "drive." The representatives patted their chests and dared to guarantee that they would catch up with and surpass Britain in about fifteen years. He said, "You saw it in the newspaper, didn't you? The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company will reach the pig iron production of 1960 this year. If this isn't 'drive,' what is it?"
    One friend thought of something he saw in the newspaper some time ago. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee transferred more than 50,000 cadres to develop mountainous areas; moreover, Secretary Fang Zichun, with his white hair, personally led the team up the mountain. This is "drive."
    Another comrade believes that the Party Committee and all the farmers in Macheng County, Hubei Province, have "drive." They overcame two serious droughts in one year and achieved a great harvest, making it a county where the yield per mu of ginned cotton reached 100 jin and the yield per mu of paddy rice reached 800 jin ten years ahead of schedule in a semi-mountainous and semi-plain area. He said that he had read Comrade Wang Renzhong's article in the People's Daily on December 29th several times and was deeply moved by the "drive" of the comrades of the Macheng County Party Committee. He cited examples that the "drive" was manifested in "grasping very tightly, consistently to the end," "cadres and the broad masses sharing joys and sorrows, and being of one heart and one mind," "overcoming difficulties step by step, and winning victories one after another," "few empty words, more practical work, and year-round continuous tense battles," and so on. He said that he had also read the challenge letter from Macheng County. The challenge letter said, "With the drive to move mountains and fill the sea, strive for a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture." My friend excitedly widened his eyes and said, "Look, even the farmers in Macheng County know what 'socialist drive' is, can we not feel 'ashamed of being inferior'?"
    One friend likes to read foreign telegrams. He said that the "drive" of us Chinese has alarmed the Western bourgeois journalists. He gave two examples. One was that after Zheng Fengrong created a new high jump record, the Associated Press reporter reported that "a twenty-year-old Chinese girl in Beijing warned the world track and field community with a powerful jump that 600 million Chinese will not always be losers." The other was recently reported by Reuters. The British Times commented on our fifteen-year plan to catch up with Britain, saying, "In less than fifteen years, Britain will definitely be defeated. ... Soon there may be a giant dragon following us."
    We cheered for his words. We laughed and said: Is the Associated Press reporter really only surprised by "a powerful jump" of "a twenty-year-old girl"? Is it really just the "track and field community" of the Western world that 600 million Chinese are warning? We think it is more interesting for the British reporter to compare us to a giant dragon. If the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are the dragon's head, each of us is a part of the dragon's body, every scale and claw, we must muster enough drive, not just follow behind Britain, but definitely catch up to its front.
    However, this requires every Chinese to have such awareness, the backward can learn from the advanced, not afraid of any difficulties, and must have the spirit to make "the river give way and the high mountain bow its head." So we also encouraged each other to take out more drive from today onwards.

### 新年话“干劲”

    新年话“干劲”
    葛德
    元旦，几个朋友来玩。见面之后，自然是彼此恭贺新禧，接着照例也发些“这一年好快哟”的感慨。然而，我们其实又都觉得这一个新年实在并不平凡。
    比如，它是从整改的高潮中过来的。我们谈论了一些尖锐而又富有风趣的大字报；谈论了一些被热烈争辩过的问题；谈论了机构的精简和干部的下放；谈论了领导人作风的转变；也谈到一个机关由于整改不力，它的领导人受到上级的督责，说是如果年前改不到80％，是不能让他轻松过年的。于是，这个机关的整改就活跃而又进展迅速起来。总之是各各都有它的新气象，人们的精神都是受到了这热潮的鼓舞和激荡的。
    还有，我们的第一个五年计划胜利完成了，而第二个五年计划又即由今天开始；还有，我们提出了十五年左右赶上或超过英国，这也是要从今天算起的。这种种都说明，1958年将是一个不平凡的年份，而今天又是这一年中的不平凡的一天，而且是第一天，这些伟大的事都要从这一天开头。
    于是，我们觉得，在这不平凡的年月里做人要格外的振作；要作一个“有志气的中国人”，必须有党所号召的那股“社会主义干劲”才行的。
    提到社会主义干劲，我们似乎都有所感受，却又不能明白说出，有那么一股“只可意会不可言传”的味道的。于是，我们便转而谈论起“干劲”是什么？
    朋友之中，有一个是做工会工作的，他认为，在中国工会第八次代表大会上，是充分表现了这“干劲”的。代表们拍拍胸脯，就敢保证一定在十五年左右赶上和超过英国。他说：“你们在报纸上看到了吧。鞍钢的工人们，今年就要达到1960年的生铁产量。这不是‘干劲’是什么？”
    有一位朋友，想到前一个时候从报纸上看到的一件事。党的江西省委，抽调了五万多干部，去开发山区；而且，那个白发苍苍的方志纯书记，又亲自带队上山去了，这就是“干劲”。
    另一个同志，认为湖北省麻城县的党委和全体农民都有“干劲”，他们一年之中，战胜了两次严重的干旱而取得了大丰收，使一个半山半平原区而先十年达到亩产皮棉百斤和水田粮食亩产八百斤的县。他说他把12月29日人民日报上王任重同志的文章读过几遍，深受麻城县委同志们那“干劲”的感动。他举例说那“干劲”表现在“抓得很紧，一贯到底”、“干部和广大群众同甘共苦、同心同德”、“一步又一步地战胜困难，一个接一个地取得胜利”、“空话少、实干多，全年都是一个接一个的紧张战斗”等等方面。他说他还读了麻城县的挑战书。那挑战书上说“以移山填海的干劲，争取农业全面大跃进”。我那朋友激动得大张着眼睛说“你们看，连麻城县的农民都知道什么是‘社会主义干劲’了，我们能不感到‘愧弗如之’吗？”
    有一个朋友是喜欢读外国电讯的。他说我们中国人的“干劲”，使西方资产阶级的新闻记者们受惊了。他举了两个例子。一个是郑凤荣创造了跳高新纪录以后，美联社的记者报道说，“一位二十岁的中国姑娘在北京以有力的一跳警告世界田径界，六亿中国人不会永远是落选选手了”。另一个是最近路透社报道的。英国泰晤士报评论我们要十五年赶上英国说，“不到十五年功夫，英国必定要被打败。……可能很快就会有一条巨龙跟在我们后面。”
    我们为他的话喝了采，我们笑着说：难道美联社记者惊讶的果真只是“一位二十岁姑娘”的“有力一跳”：六亿中国人警告的，果真又只是西方世界的“田径界”吗？我们觉得英国记者把我们比作一条巨龙就更有意思。如果说，党中央和毛主席是龙首，我们每一个人，便都是这龙身上的一部分，一鳞一爪，都要鼓足起干劲来，便不只是跟在英国的后面，而是一定要赶到它的前面去。
    然而这是需要每一个中国人都具有这样的自觉，落后的能向先进的看齐，不怕任何困难，必须有使“河水让路，高山低头”的气魄。于是我们也彼此策励，应该从即日起，拿出更多的干劲来。
