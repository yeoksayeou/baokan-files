Xinhua News Agency dispatches: According to reports, the Speaker of the Syrian Parliament and government leaders have accused the United States of continuing to pursue an aggressive policy of opposing Syria and threatening the Middle East.

Syrian Parliament Speaker Hourani said on the 18th that Dulles's preparation to attend the upcoming Baghdad Pact Council meeting proves that the United States is still pursuing the policy of the Eisenhower Doctrine and wants to rely on the Baghdad Pact to achieve its imperialist goals. The United States is also attempting to use the Baghdad Pact to establish missile bases on the territory of treaty member states, which will undoubtedly threaten the Middle East and increase the danger of war.

Hourani said that, based on Syria's experience, whenever the Baghdad Pact meets, conspiracies against Syria and Egypt occur.

Hourani also said that the people preparing to gather in Ankara want to offset the influence of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference and divert people's attention from the resolutions of the Cairo Conference, which have been recognized as a heavy blow to imperialism.

Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar told reporters from Cairo Radio on the 19th that policies such as the 1950 Tripartite Declaration of the United States, Britain, and France on supplying arms to Middle Eastern countries, the Baghdad Pact, and the "Eisenhower Doctrine" can no longer continue because they all represent the imperialists' so-called view of protecting the Middle East. He pointed out that Arabs all over the world are now determined to oppose any foreign interference in their affairs.

Bitar also said that unless the United States changes its way of dealing with the Middle East, it will be impossible for Syria's relations with the United States to return to normal.

Syrian Prime Minister Asali said on the 18th that the danger of imperialism plotting against Syria still exists; Syria is fully prepared to deal with any danger and threat.

Commenting on the importance of the Soviet-Syrian economic and technical cooperation agreement, Asali said that the Soviet Union has shown the most sincere desire to help Syria, and this assistance will help us fight against imperialism.

    叙议长和政府领导人一致指出
    美国仍在反对叙利亚和威胁中东
    企图利用巴格达条约达到帝国主义目的
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：叙利亚议会议长和政府领导人指责美国继续推行反对叙利亚和威胁中东的侵略政策。
    叙利亚议会议长胡拉尼18日说，杜勒斯准备参加即将举行的巴格达条约理事会会议，证明美国仍旧在奉行艾森豪威尔主义的政策，并且想要依靠巴格达条约来达到它的帝国主义目的。美国还企图利用巴格达条约在条约成员国领土上建立导弹基地，这无疑将会威胁中东，增加战争的危险。
    胡拉尼说，根据叙利亚的经验，每当巴格达条约开会的时候，就要发生反对叙利亚和埃及的阴谋。
    胡拉尼又说，准备在安卡拉集会的人们想要抵销亚非团结大会的影响，转移人们对开罗会议决议的注意，这些决议被公认为是对帝国主义的沉重打击。
    叙利亚外交部长比塔尔19日对开罗电台记者说，美、英、法三国1950年关于供应中东国家军火的宣言、巴格达条约和“艾森豪威尔主义”等这些政策都不可能再继续下去，因为它们都代表了帝国主义者的所谓保护中东的观点。他指出，全世界各地的阿拉伯人现在都决心反对外国对他们的事务的任何干涉。
    比塔尔还说，除非美国改变它同中东打交道的方法，否则叙利亚同美国的关系要恢复正常是不可能的。
    叙利亚总理阿萨利18日说，帝国主义对叙利亚施展阴谋的危险仍然存在；叙利亚完全有准备应付任何危险和威胁。
    阿萨利在评论苏联—叙利亚经济技术合作协定的重要性时说，苏联表现了援助叙利亚的最诚恳的愿望，这种援助将帮助我们同帝国主义进行斗争。
