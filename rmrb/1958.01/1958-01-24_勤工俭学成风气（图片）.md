    Diligent Work-Study Programs Become a Trend
    In Zhejiang Province's Dinghai Middle School, a "diligent work-study" atmosphere has already formed.
    Since the start of this semester, in addition to regularly participating in agricultural labor in nearby agricultural cooperatives, the students have also organized carpentry, rope-making, hairdressing, and brick-making labor groups. Nearly 300 students participate in these activities, with each student able to participate in labor group activities twice a week. The female students received the task of sewing shoe soles from the handicraft production cooperative, and they are working hard at it. Xu Yonghui (Xinhua News Agency draft)

    勤工俭学成风气
    在浙江省的定海中学，“勤工俭学”的风气已经形成。
    这学期来，学生们除了常到附近农业社参加农业劳动外，他们还组织了木工、搓绳、理发、制砖等劳动小组，参加劳动的学生近三百多人，每人每星期可以参加劳动小组活动两次。女学生们向手工业生产合作社领来了扎鞋底的活，她们正在使劲地干。　徐永辉摄（新华社稿）
