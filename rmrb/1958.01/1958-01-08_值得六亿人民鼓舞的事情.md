Something Worth Encouraging 600 Million People
    Shen Yinmo
    The draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has been published, along with detailed explanations. The government's action makes it easier for the emotions of our more than 600 million people to be exchanged, easier for unity to be closer, and the people's cultural level can be universally improved, so that we can wholeheartedly strengthen socialist construction together. Regardless of whether there are still some people who do not care about writing reform, or even some who do not quite agree, the vast majority of people welcome the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme.
    I excitedly read the revised draft and think it is much simpler and more convenient than the original draft. Its greatest advantage is that it adopts Latin letters that are in line with general habits—letters that we in our country have come into contact with countless times, without mixing in unfamiliar or newly created things. This makes it easy for people to accept, and it will certainly be easy to promote.
    The work of simplifying Chinese characters has been going on for a long time and has been very smooth. This is necessary under the current circumstances. However, the most important and most difficult part of Chinese character teaching is the pronunciation. If there are no standard phonetic alphabets, it will not only be difficult for teachers to carry out teaching work, but it will also be difficult for students to master the correct pronunciation, and therefore it will be difficult to remember. Although a set of phonetic symbols was created before, which was much better than the old "fanqie," it was not welcomed by most people and failed to be popularized and applied. This was mostly because people were not used to it and disliked it for being somewhat like Japanese "kana." Now, using internationally used Latin letters for phonetic notation, which have a fairly long and universal position in human cultural history, provides convenient conditions for us to learn Chinese characters. The explanation points out that the current tasks of writing reform are three: in addition to simplifying Chinese characters, there are two more, one is to promote Mandarin Chinese with Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation; and the other is to formulate a Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme to annotate Chinese characters, help teach Chinese characters, unify pronunciation, and promote Mandarin Chinese. Now that the Chinese phonetic alphabet has been initially determined, it may be tried out first. In my opinion, the two tasks of promoting Mandarin Chinese and unifying pronunciation can be combined. First of all, it is necessary to formulate teaching tools such as commonly used dictionaries, commonly used vocabularies, and dictionaries of idioms and dialects. I advocate designating a small column in the daily newspaper with the widest circulation in each place, writing a short news item every day, or timely laws and instructions, and publishing them in Chinese characters and phonetic alphabets for comparison. In particular, this method should be adopted more in newspapers and periodicals for young people and workers, so as to cultivate readers' habits of reading and using phonetic alphabets. Naturally, radio teaching or other methods can also be used to promote it. However, I have an opinion that for Chinese character phonetic notation, it is only necessary to arrange the phonetic alphabets and Chinese characters side by side or vertically, each in a row, even if it is a single character, it only needs to be annotated on the right or below, and it is not necessary to cast Chinese characters with phonetic alphabets one by one.
    As for the issue of the survival of Chinese characters, I think this cannot be predetermined, and it depends on how its evolution process unfolds.

    值得六亿人民鼓舞的事情
    沈尹默
    汉语拼音方案草案公布了，并附有详细说明。政府这样做，使我们全国六亿多人民的情感愈易交流，团结愈易亲密，人民文化水平可以普遍提高，好一心一意来共同加强社会主义建设。不管其间还有一些素不关心文字改革的人，甚至还有一些不甚赞同的人，但是广大人民是欢迎汉语拼音方案的。
    我兴奋地阅读了一遍修正草案，认为比原草案简明方便得多。它的最大好处，是采用了合乎一般习惯的——在我国不知道已经接触过多少次的拉丁字母，没有搀杂不习见的或者是新造的东西，这样就使人们容易接受，也就一定很容易推行。
    汉字简化工作已经进行了很久，也很顺利，这在目前情况下，是有它的必要性的。但是汉字教学中，最重要而且最困难的一环，还是在读音方面。若果没有制定标准的拼音字母，不但教者不易进行教学工作，而学者也难于掌握正确的读音，因而也就难于记住。以前虽曾造出一套注音字母，比旧日“反切”要好得多，却不为多数人所欢迎，没有能够普及应用。这大半是由于不习惯，而且嫌它有些像日本“假名”的缘故。现在用国际通用的拉丁字母来注音，它在人类文化历史中有相当悠久而普遍的地位，帮助我们学习汉字是有便利条件的。说明中指出，现在文字改革的任务有三项，除了简化汉字以外，还有两项，一要推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话；二要制定汉语拼音方案，用来为汉字注音，帮助教学汉字，统一读音和推广普通话。现在汉语拼音字母已经初步规定下来了，不妨可以先试推行。我的看法，推广普通话和统一读音两项工作，可以合并起来做。首先需要制定教学工具用书——常用字典、常用词汇以及成语、方言辞典等等。我主张指定在每个地方销行最广的日报上，辟一小栏，每日写一短篇时事要闻，或者是及时的法令、指示，用汉字和拼音字母，对照刊出。尤其应该在青少年及工人报刊上多采用些这样办法，以便养成读者阅读和使用拼音字母的习惯。自然还可以利用广播教学或其他方法推行。不过我有一个意见，汉字注音，只须拼音字母与汉字或者左右或者上下对照排列，各作一行，那怕是单字也只须注在右边或下边，不必要单铸成一个一个的带有拼音字母的汉字。
    至于汉字存废问题，我认为这是不能预为决定的，要看它演进的过程情形如何而定。
