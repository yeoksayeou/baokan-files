To the Editor:

    I am nearly fifty years old and have two sons. The elder, Guangyao, started working in 1951, and the younger one is still in middle school. Both are members of the Communist Youth League. Since Guangyao started working, the family income has increased, and we live a relatively prosperous life, which makes me very happy.

    However, for the past two years, there has been a knot in my heart that I can't untie. Guangyao was quite good in the first few years after he started working, being conscientious in his work, frugal in his life, and his words and actions were pleasing to the eye. But in the past two years, especially since he was transferred to be the head of the Cultural Palace, he has changed somewhat. He is particular about food and clothing and unwilling to lift a finger for trivial household matters. Sometimes when I say a few words to him, he turns a deaf ear. I often talk to his uncle and mother, saying, "Our generation has suffered some hardships and knows how life came to be. But the younger generation is different; they are unwilling to endure hardship, nor can they endure it. What will become of them if this continues!"

    Since the Party called on cadres to "go up to the mountains and down to the countryside" to engage in productive labor in the countryside and temper and transform themselves through labor, I have wholeheartedly supported this great call. However, when my child told me that he had signed up to go to the countryside to temper himself, my mood was different. I worried that he couldn't handle the physical demands of farm work, that he wouldn't be accustomed to life in the countryside, and a series of other problems came to mind. My thoughts were very contradictory. I knew that going to the countryside to temper himself was a good thing, but I was also reluctant to let him leave. I had a fluke mentality, thinking that there were so many people that my child might not be approved for relocation. But this day finally came; my child was approved for relocation on December 7th last year. At that time, my thoughts were very agitated. I didn't know whether to be happy or sad. I just felt my head was swelling and couldn't describe the feeling. After my son went to the countryside, his mother and I worried about him all day long. Although we received letters saying that everything was fine, we were still uneasy.

    A few days ago, my son returned to Xinpu for some business. It had only been twenty-odd days since we last met, but the child had undergone a great change. His body was stronger, his face had become dark and red, and he had gained more than four pounds. When he talked about the labor and living conditions in the countryside and how the uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters in the countryside warmly cared for and helped them, our whole family was indescribably happy. This time, I was relieved, and the knot in my heart for several years was untied. It is the Party that is cultivating our children to move forward. The Party's concern for young people is greater than that of their own parents. From the bottom of my heart, I thank the Party and Chairman Mao!

### 感谢党对青年人的培养

    感谢党对青年人的培养编辑同志：
    我是年近五十岁的人，有两个儿子，大的叫光耀；1951年就参加了工作；小的还在中学读书。两人都是共青团员。自从光耀参加工作后，家庭收入增加了，生活过得比较富裕，内心里非常高兴。
    可是，这两年来，我心里总有个疙瘩解不开。光耀参加工作的头几年还不错，工作认真，生活俭朴，言语行动也还顺眼。但是这两年，特别是自从他调做文化宫的负责人以来，就有些变了，讲究吃、穿，家里的屑碎事不愿伸手。我有时说他两句，他也当耳旁风。我常和他叔叔、妈妈谈：我们这一辈人还受过一些苦，知道日子是怎么过来的；可是小一辈的人就不同了，不愿吃苦，也吃不下苦，这样下去怎么得了！
    自从党号召干部“上山下乡”，到农村去生产劳动，在劳动中锻炼和改造自己以后，我从心眼里拥护这一伟大的号召。但是，当孩子向我说他已报名要求到农村去锻炼的时候，我的心情又不同了，担心孩子干庄稼活身体吃不消，担心孩子在农村过不惯等等一连串的问题都来了。我的思想很矛盾，知道下乡锻炼是好事，但是又有些舍不得孩子离开。我有一种侥幸的思想，以为人很多，不一定就批准自己的孩子下放。但是，这一天终于来了，我的孩子在去年12月7日被批准下放。当时，我的思想很激动，不知道是喜还是悲，光觉着头脑子发胀，说不出是什么滋味。儿子下乡后，我和他妈整天惦念着，虽然接到来信说一切很好，总还是放心不下。
    前两天，儿子因事回新浦来，才只二十几天没有见面，孩子就有了很大的变化：身体结实了，脸色变得又黑又红，体重增加了四斤多。当他谈到在农村劳动和生活的情况，谈到农村的大爷、大娘、兄弟姊妹们怎样热情地照顾和帮助他们的时候，我们全家都有说不出的高兴。这回我算放心了，几年来的思想疙瘩解开了。是党在培养自己的孩子前进，党对青年人的关心胜过亲生父母，我从内心里感谢党和毛主席呢。
