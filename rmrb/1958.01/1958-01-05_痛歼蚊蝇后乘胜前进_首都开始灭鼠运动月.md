Xinhua News Agency, January 4th: After thoroughly eliminating mosquitoes and flies, the people of the capital's urban areas are launching a rat eradication campaign month starting this month as part of the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests. During this period, people will use a combination of poisoning and hunting methods to launch a concentrated rat extermination effort.

The Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee made specific arrangements for the rat eradication work at a meeting of urban district heads held on the 3rd. Based on the characteristic of rats being prone to escape, it was decided to take unified action: from the 5th to the 7th of this month, the entire urban area will release rat poison for the first time, to prevent rats from taking advantage of inconsistent rat extermination actions to flee east and west; the rat poison will be released twice more in a concentrated manner before the 20th; then all rat holes will be blocked, and the corpses of rats that died outside the holes will be searched for; a city-wide inspection of the rat extermination effect will be carried out before the end of the month.

During the rat eradication campaign month, the Beijing and district health and epidemic prevention stations will provide technical guidance on the rat eradication work, and the district patriotic health campaign committees will promptly organize experience exchange meetings on rat catching and poisoning.

A publicity campaign centered on rat eradication has already begun throughout the city. Many organs, factories, schools, shops, and streets are displaying slogans and posters such as "Everyone Participate, Eliminate Rats" and "Eliminate Rats, Prevent Disease and Protect Grain." The Dongsi District Cultural Center held a rat eradication exhibition, using real people and events to publicize the harm of rats and rat extermination methods to residents. Many blackboards in various units have begun to report the good news of rat eradication. Xidan District and Xisi District held rat eradication mobilization rallies and activist conferences with more than 1,000 participants on the 3rd, and immediately took action to launch rat eradication work.

The capital's rat eradication campaign month is launched on the basis of the first battle victory in the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests. According to the inspection of more than 113,000 households in the seven urban districts, in the first battle, 90% of the households carried out thorough cleaning, 97.7% of the households had no flies indoors, and 99.3% of the households had no mosquitoes indoors. At the same time, 180,000 rats were also eliminated in urban and rural areas.

    痛歼蚊蝇后乘胜前进
    首都开始灭鼠运动月
    新华社4日讯　首都城区人民的除四害、讲卫生运动从本月初起开始了灭鼠运动月。在这个期间内，人们将用毒杀和捕打相结合的方法突击灭鼠。
    北京市爱国卫生运动委员会在3日召开的城区区长会议上对灭鼠工作作了具体部署，根据老鼠容易逃避的特点，决定采取统一行动：在本月5日到7日，整个城区将第一次投放毒杀老鼠的药物，防止老鼠趁灭鼠行动不一致的机会东逃西窜；20日以前再集中投放灭鼠药物两次；然后堵塞全部鼠洞，搜查死在洞外的鼠尸；月底前就灭鼠效果进行一次全市范围的大检查。
    在灭鼠运动月中，北京市和各区的卫生防疫站对灭鼠工作将进行技术辅导，各区爱国卫生运动委员会将及时地组织捕鼠和毒鼠的经验交流会。
    以灭鼠为中心的宣传活动已经在全市开始。许多机关、工厂、学校、商店和街道，到处出现“人人动手，消灭老鼠”、“消灭老鼠，防病保粮”的字标和宣传画。东四区文化馆举办了灭鼠展览会，通过真人真事向居民宣传老鼠的害处和灭鼠方法。各单位的许多黑板报都开始报道灭鼠的捷报。西单区和西四区在3日已分别举行了有一千多人参加的灭鼠誓师大会和积极分子大会，并且立即行动起来展开灭鼠工作。
    首都的灭鼠运动月是在除四害、讲卫生运动取得第一战役胜利的基础上开始的。根据城区七个区十一万三千多户检查，在第一个战役中，有90％的户进行了清洁大扫除，97.7％的户室内没有苍蝇，99.3％的户室内没有蚊子。同时在城乡各区还消灭了十八万只老鼠。
