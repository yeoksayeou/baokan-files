    We Stand in the Brilliant Sunlight
    —New Year's Greetings
    Xia Yan

    Today is January 1, 1958, New Year's Day.

    The New Year is a happy day, a day full of hope. However, at this moment when the East Wind prevails over the West Wind and world history has reached a new and great turning point, in the West, in capitalist countries, it seems that even the New Year is no longer a happy and hopeful day.

    In our newspapers, we can see vibrant and confident headlines every day such as "Bumper Harvest After Bumper Harvest, Leap Forward After Leap Forward." But in the West, especially in the United States, what we see in the newspapers and hear on the radio is truly too bleak and too miserable. To give an example, in the American "Newsweek" published on Christmas Eve (December 23), the entire cover used large, bold letters in the style of the Bible to print a large headline: "The Angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid...'." Why use this sentence as the cover? The "Religion" section of this magazine said:

    "As Christmas draws nearer, many Americans are troubled by fear and anxiety. Some Americans are indifferent to the major events of the moment, but others are caught in confusion and unease due to the sudden shift in world hegemony. At the same time, there are some internal problems within the United States that need to be solved, and the combination of these two seems to have damaged the brightness and optimism of American life."

    "Brightness and optimism" have been damaged, and the people are trapped in "fear and anxiety." Thus, this issue of "Newsweek" said: "Do not be afraid" is the most concentrated theme that religious circles are promoting to the masses this year. A prominent figure in the Protestant community, Dr. Niebuhr, said: "The (Soviet) satellite symbolizes a fact: we have lost the advantage we thought we possessed." Columbia University's Reverend Smith said, "We have run into the Russian stone wall... we can no longer move forward; America is limited." The vice-bishop of Chicago, Hill, hopes that people can gain strength from "meditation." He said, "Christmas is here; we should think about why we have failed. We can gain new strength and a new spirit from meditation, so that America can become a model for the world."

    Enough, no need to copy any more. Isn't this already bleak enough, miserable enough?

    Isn't this very strange? The United States, the head of the capitalist world, hasn't it been using billions of dollars for many years, through its newspapers, radio, television, movies, etc., to promote the supremacy of its "deterrent power" and the perfection of its social system and way of life to the world? After the Hiroshima test in 1945, for twelve years, hasn't it been boasting and exaggerating its atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and so-called "Vanguard" and "Atlas" missiles, etc., to carry out intimidation and blackmail, to make mothers and children all over the world "fear and be uneasy"? Why, in the blink of an eye, have those who wanted to make others fear become afraid themselves? Why even mobilize angels and pastors to persuade people "not to be afraid"?

    The matter is already very clear, and the conclusion has been drawn. That is: human history has reached a new turning point, and the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind. The news from the East Wind tells us that the prediction made by Marx and Engels in the "Communist Manifesto" one hundred and ten years ago is about to be realized.

    Living in such a new turning point is a blessing. To be able to contribute one's strength to this great era is something to be proud of. Let the Dulleses "fear" and "pray," we stand in the brilliant sunlight, and hope, confidence, and happiness are all on our side. 1958 is here, we cheer: "Leap forward, and leap forward again!"

    我们站在灿烂的阳光里
    ——迎新之辞
    夏衍
    今天是1958年元旦。
    新年是快乐的日子，是充满希望的日子，可是，当此东风压倒了西风，世界历史到达了新的伟大转折点的时候，在西方，在资本主义国家里，似乎连新年也不再是快乐和充满希望的日子了。
    在我们报纸上，每天都可以看到“丰收再丰收，跃进再跃进”这样朝气蓬勃、充满信心的大标题，而在西方，特别是在美国，报纸上看到和广播中听到的，实在是太黯淡、太凄惨了。举一个例子，在圣诞前夕（12月23日）出版的美国“新闻周刊”上，整个封面用圣经体的大活字印上了一个大标题：文曰：“天使告诉他们，不要怕……”。为什么用这句话做封面？这期杂志的“宗教栏”里说：
    “圣诞一天一天接近了，许多美国人却困扰在恐惧和不安之中。有些美国人，对当前的重大事件是一片冷淡，可是别的美国人，却由于世界霸权的突然转移，正陷于惶惑和不安之中。同时，在美国国内，又有一些内部的不安问题需要解决，这两者似乎已经损害了美国生活的光明与乐观。”
    “光明和乐观”被损害了，人民陷于“恐惧和不安”之中，于是，这一期的“新闻周刊”说：“不要怕”是今年宗教界向人民群众宣传的最集中的主题。一位新教界的名流纽伯博士说：“（苏联的）卫星象征了一个事实：我们已经失去了自以为拥有的优势”，哥伦比亚大学的史密斯牧师说：“我们已经碰上了俄国的石墙，……我们不能再前进了，美国是有限的”，芝加哥市的副主教希尔，则希望人们能够从“默想”中去获得力量，他说：“圣诞节来了，应该想想我们为什么会失败，我们可以从默想中得到新的力量和新的精神，使美国成为世界的模范。”
    够了，不必再抄了，这不是已经够黯淡、够凄惨了么？
    这不是很奇怪吗？美国这一个资本主义世界的头子，多少年来，不是一直使用了亿万的金元，通过他的报刊、广播、电视、电影等等，向世界宣传着它的“威慑力量”的至高无上，它的社会制度、生活方式的完美无缺吗？1945年广岛一试之后，一十二年，它不是一直在吹嘘夸耀它的原子武器、氢武器、和什么“先锋号”和“阿特拉斯号”导弹等等，来进行恐吓讹诈，来使得全世界的母亲和孩子们“恐惧和不安”么？为什么一转眼间，要使别人恐惧的人倒反而自己恐惧了呢？为什么甚至于要动员天使和牧师来劝人“不要害怕”了呢？
    事情已经很明白，结论已经做出了，这就是：人类历史已经到达了新的转折点，东风压倒了西风。东风传来的消息告诉我们，马克思和恩格斯一百一十年前在“共产党宣言”中的预言，就快要实现了。
    生活在这样一个新的转折点上的人，是幸福的，能够把自己的一分力量贡献给这个伟大的时代，是值得自傲的。让杜勒斯们去“害怕”、去“祈祷”吧，我们站在灿烂的阳光里，希望、信心、快乐，都在我们这一边，1958年来了，我们欢呼：“跃进，再跃进！”
