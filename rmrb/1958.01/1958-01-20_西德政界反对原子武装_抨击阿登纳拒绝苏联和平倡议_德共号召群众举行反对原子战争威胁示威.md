Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The German Communist Party has called on the people of West Germany to launch a popular referendum movement against atomic armament. Meanwhile, West German political circles and newspapers continue to criticize Adenauer's speech rejecting Soviet peace proposals.

According to a report by "904 German Free Broadcasting Station" on the 18th, the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a letter to the people of West Germany, calling on West German workers, trade union members, and social democrats to pass resolutions against atomic armament in enterprises and trade unions, and to hold mass rallies and demonstrations against the threat of atomic war. The Central Committee of the German Communist Party called on the West German working people to unite and fight to safeguard peace, oppose West Germany's atomic armament, and urge the West German government to agree to negotiations on establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

The "Social Democratic News Bulletin" of the West German Social Democratic Party severely criticized West German Chancellor Adenauer's radio speech on January 15, considering it as "expressing the idea of so-called power politics," which is "refusing to contribute to easing East-West tensions." The news bulletin believes that the parts of the Soviet proposal concerning the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe and the withdrawal of foreign troops from the region "can be discussed," and these proposals "can at least serve as a basis for negotiations to ease tensions in Europe." The news bulletin said: "The Federal Chancellor's speech undermines this foundation and thus sends a signal to continue the unrestricted arms race."

The "Welt" newspaper, the news bulletin of the Free Democratic Party, criticized all the main points of Adenauer's speech. The newspaper wrote: "It must be made clear to the Federal Chancellor that creating an irresolvable dispute between Bonn and Moscow on the issue of supervised disarmament is not conducive to adopting a German policy that considers how to resolve the national question." The newspaper also pointed out that Adenauer's arguments against establishing a European nuclear-weapon-free zone would cause a bad reaction in Europe.

Within Adenauer's own party, the Christian Democratic Union, Member of Parliament Peter Nellen published an article in a magazine published in Augsburg expressing support for the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and he also advocated conducting "realistic discussions" with the Soviet Union. Peter Nellen has for some time disagreed with Adenauer due to dissatisfaction with West Germany's rearmament policy, and this disagreement has reached its climax in recent days with his expulsion from the Christian Democratic Union.

The "Stuttgarter Zeitung" believes that Adenauer's attitude means "another opportunity has been missed to take the first step towards easing tensions by solving a certain part of the complex disarmament issue." The "Stuttgarter Zeitung" opposes Adenauer's entanglement of the German unification issue with the disarmament issue. The newspaper pointed out: This "precisely hinders discussions on the German question." The "Frankfurter Rundschau" expressed regret over Adenauer's rejection of the proposal for a European nuclear-weapon-free zone and accused Adenauer of pursuing a policy that endangers the future of the German people by disregarding the demands of West German public opinion.

Well-informed sources in Bonn revealed that there have been major differences of opinion within the West German Ministry of Defense for more than a year on major issues such as the establishment of rocket bases. A group of senior officers, represented by former Nazi generals Heusinger and Speidel, who were favored by Adenauer, actively supported the plan to establish American rocket bases in West Germany and store atomic weapons, and opposed the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe on the pretext of "military considerations." Another group of influential senior officers, headed by Lieutenant General Hans Rottiger, Director of the Army Department of the Ministry of Defense, opposed pursuing a policy of submitting to the plans of the American General Staff. They believe that if the West German army is equipped with rocket weapons and American atomic weapons are stored in West Germany, it will inevitably bring about total destruction to West Germany in the event of a conflict. The differences between these two factions have recently become increasingly acute.

    西德政界反对原子武装
    抨击阿登纳拒绝苏联和平倡议
    德共号召群众举行反对原子战争威胁示威
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：德国共产党号召西德人民发动反对原子武装的人民投票运动。同时，西德政界和报纸继续抨击阿登纳拒绝苏联和平建议的演说。
    “九○四德国自由广播电台”18日报道，德国共产党中央委员会发表告西德人民书，号召西德工人、工会会员和社会民主党人在企业里和在工会里通过关于反对原子武装的决议，并且举行反对原子战争威胁的群众大会和大示威。德国共产党中央委员会号召西德劳动人民联合起来，为维护和平、反对西德进行原子武装、促使西德政府同意进行关于建立无原子武器区的谈判而斗争。
    西德社会民主党的“社会民主新闻公报”严厉地抨击西德总理阿登纳1月15日发表的广播演说，认为是“表现了所谓实力政策的思想”，也就是“拒绝为缓和东西方紧张局势作出贡献”，新闻公报认为，苏联建议中关于建立中欧无原子武器地区和外国军队撤出这个地区的部分，“是可以讨论的”，这些建议“至少可以作为缓和欧洲紧张局势的谈判的基础”。新闻公报说：“联邦总理的演说破坏了这个基础，因而就是发出了继续进行无限制的军备竞赛的信号”。
    自由民主党的新闻公报“世界报”抨击了阿登纳演说的全部主要论点。这家报纸写道：“必须清楚地告诉联邦总理，在有监督的裁军问题上制造波恩和莫斯科之间的无法解决的争论，这不利于采取一项考虑到如何解决民族问题的德国政策”。这家报纸还指出，阿登纳反对建立欧洲无原子武器地区的论据在欧洲将引起不好的反应。
    在阿登纳自己的党——基督教民主联盟内部，议员彼得·内伦在奥格斯堡出版的一家杂志上发表文章表示支持建立中欧无原子武器地区的建议，他同时还主张同苏联进行“现实的讨论”。彼得·内伦一个时期以来就已经因为不满西德的重新武装政策而同阿登纳发生意见分歧，这种分歧已经在最近几天中由于他的被开除出基督教民主联盟而到达顶点。
    “斯图加特日报”认为，阿登纳的态度意味着“又放过了通过解决复杂的裁军问题的某一部分而向缓和紧张局势迈出第一步的机会”。“斯图加特日报”反对阿登纳把德国统一问题同裁军问题纠缠在一起。这家报纸指出：这“恰恰阻碍了关于德国问题的讨论”。“法兰克福评论报”对阿登纳拒绝欧洲无原子武器区的建议表示遗憾，并且指责阿登纳不考虑西德舆论的要求而奉行危害德国人民前途的政策。
    波恩消息灵通人士透露，西德国防部内部在有关建立火箭基地等重大问题上一年多以来一直存在着重大的意见分歧。以前纳粹将领豪辛格和斯派达尔为代表的一批受阿登纳宠信的高级军官积极支持在西德建立美国火箭基地和储存原子武器的计划，并且借口“军事上的考虑”反对在中欧建立无原子武器区。另外以国防部陆军司司长汉斯·勒提格尔陆军中将为首的一批有势力的高级军官则反对奉行屈从美国总参谋部计划的政策。他们认为，如果西德军队配备火箭武器并且在西德境内存放美国原子武器，那么，一旦发生冲突，就必然会替西德招来全盘性的毁灭。这两派之间的分歧最近已经越来越尖锐。
