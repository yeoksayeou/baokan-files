Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th. Our reporter recently visited Comrade Antonov, Vice-Chairman of the Moscow National Economic Council, and asked him to introduce the work of the Moscow Economic Region since its establishment, as well as the situation of transferring cadres and formulating the seven-year long-term plan.

Comrade Antonov pointed out that the Moscow National Economic Council has only been established for half a year since July 1, 1957, but during this period, this new method of national economic management has demonstrated many advantages. He said that the Moscow National Economic Council manages 565 enterprises, which were previously managed by dozens of different departments. After these enterprises were unified under the management of the committee, the management work became very timely and agile, the work efficiency was improved, and at the same time, solving problems was more comprehensive and effective than before.

Secondly, the new management method makes it easier to rely on the masses and give full play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. For example, since the establishment of the Moscow Economic Region, there has been a great improvement in encouraging the inventions and creations of the broad masses of workers and putting forward rationalization proposals. In the third quarter of 1957, the number of rationalization proposals increased to nearly 100,000, and the number of people who made suggestions was more than 57,600.

More importantly, since the implementation of the new management method, all important issues in enterprises must first be discussed by the employees of the enterprise, and proposals and suggestions are put forward. Many production and technical problems are solved locally in the enterprise by mobilizing workers, engineers, and technicians.

Antonov said that the new management method brings great benefits to the implementation of the economy system. The first is to streamline the organization and reduce the level of management to the minimum. Problems that the Moscow Economic Region cannot solve can now be directly submitted to the Council of Ministers or the State Planning Commission for resolution. More problems are solved within the scope of the economic region. The new management method has also had a new impact on avoiding long-distance transportation and solving the supply of raw materials. The phenomenon that various management agencies had to send a large number of people on business trips to other places no longer exists.

When talking about the issue of reducing personnel and transferring cadres to production, Antonov said that when the new system was implemented, more than 20 ministries and many administrations were abolished, and a large number of personnel were transferred to production in various places. After the establishment of the economic region, the work of reducing personnel has not stopped. For example, the management agencies of the Moscow National Economic Region have reduced more than 800 people since their establishment. The reduced personnel are very willing to go to labor production because, on the one hand, they all come from production labor, and practical production is not unfamiliar to them; on the other hand, returning to labor production can better exert their talents. The work of reducing personnel and transferring cadres will continue.

The Vice-Chairman of the Committee said that the plan for the Moscow Economic Region in 1957 was completed very well, and the value of products over-produced was more than 2 billion rubles. In 1958, Moscow enterprises will produce products worth 60 billion rubles.

Antonov also introduced the situation of the Moscow Economic Region's research and compilation of the seven-year long-term plan. He said that the long-term plans of Moscow factories have been completed. The National Economic Council began to study and compile the long-term plan for the entire region on December 15, 1957. The main aspects of the long-term plan of the Moscow Economic Region are to automate and mechanize the entire production process, implement production specialization, and improve the product quality of various departments.

### 莫斯科经济区半年来成绩很大  实行新管理方法后解决问题较前全面有效

    莫斯科经济区半年来成绩很大
    实行新管理方法后解决问题较前全面有效
    据新华社莫斯科6日电　本社记者最近曾经访问了莫斯科国民经济委员会副主席安东诺夫同志，请他介绍一下莫斯科经济区成立以来的工作情况，以及下放干部和制定七年远景计划的情况。
    安东诺夫同志指出，莫斯科国民经济委员会从1957年7月1日成立以来刚刚半年，但是，在这期间这种新的国民经济管理方法就表现出了许多优越性。他说，莫斯科国民经济委员会管理着五百六十五个企业，而这些企业过去归好几十个不同的部门管理。这些企业统一由委员会管理之后，管理工作就非常及时、敏捷，工作效率提高了，同时，解决问题也更比以前全面有效了。
    其次，新的管理方法使得依靠群众、发挥广大职工的积极性的问题更容易得到解决。例如莫斯科经济区成立以后，在鼓励广大职工的发明创造和提合理化建议方面有了很大改进。在1957年第三季度，合理化建议的数目增加到将近十万件，提建议的人数是五万七千六百多人。
    更重要的是实行新管理方法以来，一切关于企业中的重要问题都要先经过企业的职工讨论，提出方案和建议。许多生产上和技术上的问题都是就近在企业中发动工人和工程技术人员来解决的。
    安东诺夫说，新的管理方法给贯彻节约制度带来极大的益处。首先是精简了机构，使管理机构的层次减少到了最低限度。莫斯科经济区不能解决的问题，现在可以直接提交部长会议或国家计划委员会解决。更多的问题在经济区的范围内就解决了。在避免远距离运输、解决原料供应等方面，新的管理方法也产生了新的影响。过去各管理机构要派大批出差人员到外地去的现象已经没有了。
    在谈到缩减人员、下放干部到生产中去的问题的时候，安东诺夫说，在实行新制度的时候，撤销了二十多个部以及许多管理局，大批的人员下放到各地的生产中去。经济区成立之后，缩减人员的工作仍然没有停止。如莫斯科国民经济区的各管理机构从成立到现在又缩减了八百多人。缩减的人员都非常乐意到劳动生产中去，因为，一方面他们都是从生产劳动中来的，实际生产对他们并不陌生，另一方面，回到劳动生产中去，更可以发挥他们的才能。缩减人员、下放干部的工作还会继续进行。
    这位委员会副主席说，1957年莫斯科经济区计划完成得很好，超计划生产了二十多亿卢布的产品。1958年莫斯科各企业将生产价值六百亿卢布的产品。
    安东诺夫还介绍了莫斯科经济区研究和编制七年远景计划的情况。他说，莫斯科各个工厂已经将远景计划编制完成。国民经济委员会从1957年12月15日起就开始研究和编制全区的远景计划。莫斯科经济区远景计划的主要方面是使全部生产过程自动化和机械化，实行生产专业化，以及提高各个部门的产品质量。
