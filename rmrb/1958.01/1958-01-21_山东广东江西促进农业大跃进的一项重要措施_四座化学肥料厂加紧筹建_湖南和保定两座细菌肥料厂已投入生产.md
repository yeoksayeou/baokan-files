Qingdao Daily News: The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee have decided to build a chemical fertilizer plant in Qingdao. Currently, various preparatory works are being accelerated, and it is expected to start construction in August this year.

The construction of this plant will be carried out in phases, with construction and production proceeding simultaneously. It is estimated that after the completion of the first phase of the project in 1960, it can produce 70,000 tons of ammonium chloride (chlorine fertilizer) annually, and jointly produce 70,000 tons of soda ash. After the completion of the second phase of the project in 1963, it can produce 160,000 tons of ammonium chloride annually, and jointly produce 160,000 tons of soda ash. After the completion of all projects, it can produce 600,000 tons of ammonium chloride and soda ash each year.

The raw materials for producing ammonium chloride and soda ash are mainly washing salt and anthracite. Therefore, the site of this chemical fertilizer plant will be located on the Jiaozhou Bay beach north of Cangkou. It is very close to the salt production area of Jiaozhou Bay Salt Field and the production areas of coking coal in Boshan and anthracite in Fangzi, and sea and land transportation are also more convenient.

Southern Daily News: The two chemical fertilizer plants with an annual output of 410,000 tons of chemical fertilizers – Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant and Zhanjiang Phosphate Fertilizer Plant – are speeding up construction. It is expected that the two plants can break ground this year and start production in early 1961.

The main product of Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant is fertilizer powder (ammonium sulfate). After the completion of the first phase of the project in 1960, it can produce 88,000 tons annually, and after the completion of the second phase of the project in 1962, it can produce 210,000 tons annually. After the completion of Zhanjiang Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, it will produce 200,000 tons of ordinary superphosphate annually.

The nitrogen content of ammonium sulfate produced by Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant is 21%, and the phosphorus content of ordinary superphosphate produced by Zhanjiang Phosphate Fertilizer Plant is 18.7%. Nitrogen fertilizer promotes leaf growth, and phosphorus fertilizer promotes fruit growth. Appropriate use of these two fertilizers can greatly increase agricultural production.

Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant uses water, air, coal, and pyrite as the main raw materials. The main raw materials of Zhanjiang Phosphate Fertilizer Plant are phosphate rock, pyrite, and coal. It is understood that a large amount of phosphate rock has recently been discovered in the Shiwandashan Mountains in Hepu Special Zone, and phosphate rock has also been discovered in Hepu County. Relevant units are conducting investigations for development.

Both plants are designed by our country and manufacture complete sets of machinery and equipment independently.

Jiangxi Daily News: A factory that uses cheap limestone and anthracite as main raw materials to manufacture lime nitrogen fertilizer – the Southern Jiangxi Lime Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant – will be built in the suburbs of Ganzhou City. At present, the preparatory work for the construction of the plant is actively underway.

The scale of the first phase of the construction project of this plant is to produce 20,000 tons of calcium carbide and 20,000 tons of lime nitrogen annually. It is expected to start production in the second quarter of 1959.

The lime nitrogen (calcium cyanamide) product produced by this factory is not only an alkaline chemical fertilizer, but also calcium carbide and lime nitrogen are basic raw materials for producing synthetic fibers, amino plastics, polyvinyl chloride plastics, and organic solvents and other organic products.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 18th: The local state-owned Hunan Bacterial Fertilizer Plant officially went into production on the 17th. This year, it will produce 400 tons of Azotobacter agents and 200,000 bottles of Rhizobium agents, an increase of 14 times compared with the original 1958 production plan.

This factory started construction in 1956, and started construction and production simultaneously last year. A total of 15 tons of Azotobacter agents and more than 13,000 bottles of Rhizobium agents were produced throughout the year.

In addition to producing Azotobacter agents and Rhizobium agents bacterial fertilizers, it is also preparing to expand the variety of bacterial fertilizers, such as potassium and phosphorus bacterial fertilizers.

According to the results of small-scale experiments in Hunan in recent years, Rhizobium agents can generally increase peanut production by 13% and soybean production by 10%; Azotobacter agents can generally increase rice production by about 10%. According to the ex-factory price of Hunan Bacterial Fertilizer Plant, each bottle of Rhizobium agent (400 grams) costs 1.2 yuan and can fertilize 20 mu of land, with a cost of only 6 cents per mu; each kilogram of Azotobacter agent only costs 28 cents and can fertilize 1 mu of land. These two fertilizers can be used for seed mixing, or as base fertilizer and top dressing, which is very convenient to use.

Baoding Bacterial Fertilizer Plant officially went into production on January 1.

In the past year or so, this fertilizer plant has successfully researched and trial-produced bacterial fertilizers such as phosphorus bacteria, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Rhizobium, and silicate bacteria, and has produced more than 42,000 jin in small batches. After officially putting into production, the daily output can reach 8,000 to more than 10,000 jin. These bacterial fertilizers are made by artificially cultivating and mixing them with grass ash. They not only have great fertilizer efficiency, but also have low cost.

In order to support the great leap forward in agricultural production, all employees of this factory guarantee to produce 500 tons of various bacterial fertilizers in the first quarter of 1958.

    山东广东江西促进农业大跃进的一项重要措施
    四座化学肥料厂加紧筹建
    湖南和保定两座细菌肥料厂已投入生产
    本报讯　青岛日报消息：中共山东省委与省人民委员会已经确定在青岛市兴建一座化学肥料厂。现在，各项准备工作正在加紧进行，预计在今年8月可动工兴建。
    这个厂的工程将分期施工，边建设，边生产。预计第一期工程在1960年完成后，可年产七万吨氯化铵（氯肥），联产七万吨纯碱。到1963年第二期工程完成后，可年产十六万吨氯化铵，联产十六万吨纯碱。全部工程建成后，每年可生产氯化铵、纯碱各六十万吨。
    生产氯化铵和纯碱的原料主要是用洗涤盐和无烟煤，因此，这个化学肥料厂的厂址将设立在沧口以北胶州湾海滨。这里离胶州湾盐场食盐产地和博山的焦炭、坊子的无烟煤的产地都很近，海运和陆运交通也较便利。
    本报讯　南方日报消息：年产化学肥料共四十一万吨的两个化学肥料厂——广州氮肥厂和湛江磷肥厂，正在加紧筹建。预计两厂在今年内可以破土动工，到1961年初，便可以开始投入生产。
    广州氮肥厂的主要产品是肥田粉（硫酸铵），到1960年第一期工程完成后，可年产八万八千吨，1962年第二期工程完成后，可年产二十一万吨。湛江磷肥厂建成后，将年产普通过磷酸钙二十万吨。
    广州氮肥厂的硫酸铵含氮量21％，湛江磷肥厂的普通过磷酸钙含磷量18.7％。氮肥长叶，磷肥长果，适量地使用这两种肥料，对于农业增产有很大作用。
    广州氮肥厂利用水、空气、煤和硫铁矿作为主要原料。湛江磷肥厂的主要原料是磷灰石、硫铁矿和煤等。据了解，最近在合浦专区的十万大山发现有大量磷矿石，在合浦县境也已发现磷灰石。有关单位正进行调查，以便开发。
    这两个厂都是由我国自己设计和自行制造全套机械设备。
    本报讯　江西日报消息：一座利用价廉的石灰石和无烟煤等主要原料制造石灰氮肥的工厂——赣南石灰氮肥厂，将在赣州市市郊兴建。目前，建厂筹建工作正在积极进行。
    这个厂第一期建设工程的规模，为年产电石二万吨、石灰氮二万吨。预计1959年第二季度即可开始生产。
    这个厂生产的石灰氮（氰氨化钙）产品，不仅是一种碱性化学肥料，而且，电石和石灰氮又是生产合成纤维、氨基塑料、聚氯乙烯塑料以及有机溶剂等有机产品的基本原料。
    新华社长沙18日电　地方国营湖南细菌肥料厂17日正式投入生产。它在今年将生产自生固氮菌剂四百吨，根瘤菌剂二十万瓶，比原订1958年生产计划提高了十四倍。
    这个厂是1956年开始兴建的，去年就开始边建边生产，全年共生产了自生固氮菌剂十五吨，根瘤菌剂一万三千余瓶。
    它除了生产自生固氮菌剂和根瘤菌剂细菌肥料以外，还准备扩大细菌肥料的品种，如钾、磷等细菌肥料。
    根据湖南几年来小规模试验的结果，根瘤菌剂一般可以使花生增产13％，大豆增产10％；自生固氮菌剂一般可使水稻增产10％左右。按照湖南细菌肥料厂出厂价格，根瘤菌剂每瓶（四百克）价一元二角，可以肥田二十亩，每亩成本仅六分钱；自生固氮菌剂每公斤只需二角八分钱，可肥田一亩。这两种肥料可以用作拌种，也可以作基肥、追肥，使用很方便。
    本报讯　保定细菌肥料厂已经在1月1日正式投入生产。
    这个肥料厂在过去的一年多的时间里，研究试制成功了磷细菌、固氮菌、根瘤菌、硅酸盐菌等细菌肥料，并且已经小批生产了四万二千余斤。在正式投入生产后，每天生产量可达八千到一万多斤。这几种细菌肥料，是经过人工专门培养后，加掺拌草木灰制成的。不但肥效大，而且成本低。
    为了支援农业生产大跃进，这个厂全体职工保证在1958年第一季度生产出各种细菌肥料五百吨。
