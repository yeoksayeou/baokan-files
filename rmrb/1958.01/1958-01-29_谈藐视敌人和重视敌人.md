    On Despising the Enemy and Taking the Enemy Seriously
    Jian Zhi

    Recently, newspapers frequently use heroic words such as "Have the heroic spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain" and "Make the high mountains bow their heads and the rivers give way." This is a reflection of the revolutionary optimism and heroism of our era.

    For any Communist Party member or Communist Youth League member, the first requirement is to have revolutionary optimism and revolutionary heroism. This is the most basic requirement for Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Because from the day they join the Party or the League, they should have a great ambition, which is to transform human society, transform nature, transform the objective world, and at the same time transform themselves and transform the subjective world. To do such a great and arduous undertaking, it is impossible without revolutionary ambition.

    More than a hundred years ago, when the founders of communism, Marx and Engels, published the Communist Manifesto, only they two truly believed, based on scientific analysis, that communism would inevitably replace capitalism. However, they dared to issue a call to battle: bury capitalism. At that time, many people regarded Marx and Engels as utopians and even said they were "madmen." But Marx and Engels were full of determination and confidence in the cause of communism and devoted their lives to this cause. Since then, more than a century has passed, and the cause of communism has indeed flourished as Marx and Engels predicted, and has achieved great victories worldwide. Thirty or forty years ago, after the salvo of the October Revolution brought Marxism to China, there were only a dozen or so early Chinese communists, but they dared to declare war on the two great mountains that weighed on the Chinese people at that time: imperialism and feudalism. Since that time, the Chinese revolution has entered a new era. After decades of heroic struggle by countless people with lofty ideals and the broad masses of the people, the People's Republic of China was finally established, and great victories were achieved in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. From this, we can see that for us revolutionaries, the first thing is to have revolutionary ambition, that is, to despise all enemies and have the determination and confidence to defeat all enemies.

    In fact, this is also the case when we do any work. First of all, we must despise all enemies (difficulties) and have the determination and confidence to overcome any enemy (difficulties), otherwise no work can be accomplished. For example, to establish an agricultural producers' cooperative, you must first not be afraid of any difficulties, and have the determination and confidence to establish such a cooperative. Then you can start from organizing mutual aid teams, step by step through year-round mutual aid teams, elementary cooperatives, and finally enter advanced cooperatives. If you don't have the ambition to despise all difficulties from the beginning, and you don't have determination or confidence, how can this cooperative be established? Spring plowing and summer weeding are also the same. First, you must decide to cultivate this piece of land, and then you can cultivate it row by row; first, you must have the determination to remove the weeds, and then you can remove them one by one.

    Even people's daily lives are like this. For example, when eating, you must first be determined to eliminate (eat) a bowl of rice, and then you can eat it bite by bite. Another example is walking. First, you must decide to walk from this street to that street, and then you can walk step by step to your destination.

    Therefore, no matter what you do, you must first have the spirit of despising all enemies (difficulties). What we mean by despising all enemies (difficulties) is from the general aspect, from the strategic aspect. This does not mean that we can ignore every specific enemy (difficulty), nor does it mean that we can deal with specific enemies (difficulties) carelessly, let alone that we can turn a blind eye to every specific enemy (difficulty); on the contrary, tactically, we must pay great attention to every specific enemy (difficulty) and carefully study the methods to deal with it. This is the contradictory unity of our revolutionary strategy and tactics.

    First, despise all enemies strategically, and at the same time, attach great importance to every specific enemy tactically—this is the dialectical law that Chairman Mao often taught us to grasp when carrying out revolutionary struggles and any work.

    Strategically despising all enemies is the true color of revolutionaries. Our strategic contempt for all enemies is not based on unfounded fantasies. Because we believe in truth and believe in the masses. We believe that all systems of exploitation, whether feudalism, capitalism, or its final stage, imperialism, will eventually give way to socialism and communism; in the process of this change, the strength of the enemy is only superficial and temporary. In the final analysis, the day when socialism achieves final victory throughout the world will eventually come. We believe that the power of the masses is inexhaustible, and all difficulties will be overcome; the various obstacles and twists and turns on the road forward are temporary and can be completely overcome. We believe that Marxism-Leninism is an invincible weapon, and as long as we master and are good at using this weapon, we can "ride the long wind and break through thousands of miles of waves." This belief is the basis for our contempt for all enemies and the scientific basis for revolutionary optimism and revolutionary heroism. The lack of this belief is a common feature of all right-leaning opportunism, revisionism, and various right-leaning conservative ideas.

    Of course, having the ambition to despise all enemies does not mean that the revolution will succeed. But without this revolutionary ambition, shrinking back in front of the enemy, succumbing to the enemy's powerful appearance, being discouraged in the face of difficulties, and being frightened by temporary difficulties, how can we expect the victory of the revolution and the success of the work? It should be said that the revolutionary ambition to despise all enemies (difficulties) is a prerequisite for us to carry out revolutionary struggles and any work. With this prerequisite, we can talk about defeating the enemy and overcoming difficulties.

    If strategically despising all enemies is our fundamental difference from right-leaning opportunism, then tactically attaching importance to every specific enemy is our fundamental difference from "left"-leaning adventurism. "Left"-leaning adventurists do not adopt a realistic and serious attitude towards specific enemies and difficulties, but only act based on subjective wishes, deviating from the objective reality of the time and place, and the result is hitting walls and getting battered and bruised everywhere. We Marxists despise all enemies and at the same time value every enemy. We have full determination and confidence to defeat the enemy, and at the same time, we are realistic, carefully analyze the enemy's strengths and weaknesses, carefully estimate our own advantages and disadvantages, carefully consider the degree of awareness of the masses, and then formulate plans and steps, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, give full play to our own advantages and overcome shortcomings, fully utilize the enemy's weaknesses, and weaken or avoid its strengths, step by step, one by one, to eliminate the enemy.

    Without the spirit of despising all enemies, the revolution cannot be successful; without a method of seriously dealing with specific enemies, the revolution will also fail. We must oppose both right-leaning conservatism and "left"-leaning reckless actions. And at present, when China's socialist revolution and socialist construction are booming, opposing right-leaning conservative ideas, advocating having a revolutionary spirit that despises all enemies and difficulties, and advocating revolutionary optimism and revolutionary heroism, has practical significance of paramount importance.

    谈藐视敌人和重视敌人
    健之
    最近报纸上经常出现“要有愚公移山的英雄气概”、“要叫高山低头、河水让路”等等豪语，这是我们时代的革命的乐观主义和英雄主义的精神的反映。
    对于任何一个共产党员和共青团员来说，首先要求他的是要有革命的乐观主义和革命的英雄主义。这是对共产党员和共青团员最起码的要求。因为他们从入党入团的那一天起，就应该有一个伟大的抱负，这就是要改造人类社会，改造大自然，改造客观世界，同时也要改造自己，改造主观世界。要干这样的伟大的同时也是艰巨的事业，没有革命的志气是不行的。
    一百多年前，当共产主义的创始人马克思和恩格斯发表共产党宣言的时候，真正根据科学的分析而深信共产主义必将代替资本主义的，只有他们两个人，但是，他们就敢于发出战斗的号召：埋葬资本主义。当时，许多人把马克思和恩格斯看作是空想家，甚至说他们是“疯子”。而马克思和恩格斯则对共产主义事业充满决心和信心，并且将毕生精力投到这个事业中去。从那时以来，一个多世纪过去了，共产主义事业果然像马克思和恩格斯所预见的那样蒸蒸日上，已经在世界范围内取得了伟大的胜利。三、四十年以前，当十月革命的一声炮响把马克思主义送到中国来以后，我国第一批共产主义者只有十多个人，但是他们就敢于向当时压在中国人民头上的两座大山——帝国主义和封建主义宣战。从那个时候以后，中国革命开始了一个崭新的时代，经过了数十年来无数志士仁人和广大人民群众的英勇奋斗，终于建立了人民共和国，并取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。从这里我们可以看到，对于我们革命者来说，首先要有革命的志气，就是说，首先要藐视一切敌人，有决心和有信心打倒一切敌人。
    其实，我们做任何工作也是这样，首先要藐视一切敌人（困难），要有决心和信心战胜任何敌人（困难），否则任何工作也做不成。比方说，要建立一个农业生产合作社，你首先就要不怕任何困难，有建立这样一个合作社的决心和信心，然后你才能从组织互助组开始，一步一步地经过常年互助组、低级合作社，最后进到高级合作社。如果你开始就没有藐视一切困难的志气，没有决心，也没有信心，这个合作社怎能建立起来呢？春耕夏耘也是这样，首先你要决定耕这块地，然后才一行又一行地去耕；首先你要有决心把杂草锄掉，然后才一棵一棵地去锄。
    甚至人们的日常生活也是这样。比如说吃饭，首先你要下决心把一碗饭消灭（吃）掉，然后才一口一口地吃。又如走路，首先你要决定从这条街走到那条街，然后才一步一步地走到目的地。
    因此，无论做什么事情，首先要有藐视一切敌人（困难）的气概。我们说的要藐视一切敌人（困难），是从总的方面说的，是从战略上说的。这并不是说我们可以不重视每个具体的敌人（困难），不是说可以粗心大意地对付具体的敌人（困难），更不是说可以对每个具体的敌人（困难）视若无睹；恰恰相反，在战术上，我们要十分重视每一个具体的敌人（困难），认真讲究对付它的办法。这就是我们革命战略和战术的矛盾的统一。
    首先要在战略上藐视一切敌人，同时要在战术上十分重视每个具体的敌人——这就是毛主席经常教导我们进行革命斗争和任何工作的时候必须掌握的辩证的规律。
    在战略上藐视一切敌人，是革命者应有的本色。我们在战略上藐视一切敌人，并不是毫无根据的幻想。因为我们相信真理，相信群众。我们相信一切剥削制度，无论是封建主义制度、资本主义制度以及它的最后阶段帝国主义，终将让位于社会主义、共产主义制度；在这变革的过程中，敌人的强大只是表面的暂时的。归根到底，社会主义在全世界取得最后胜利的日子终将到来。我们相信，群众的力量是无穷无尽的，一切困难必将被克服；在前进的道路上的种种障碍和曲折，都是完全可以克服的暂时的。我们相信，马克思列宁主义是战无不胜的武器，只要掌握和善于运用这个武器，就能“乘长风破万里浪”。这种信念，就是我们藐视一切敌人的基础，就是革命乐观主义和革命英雄主义的科学根据。缺乏这种信念，是一切右倾机会主义、修正主义以及形形色色的右倾保守思想的共同特征。
    当然，有了藐视一切敌人的志气，并不等于革命就成功了。但是如果没有这种革命志气，在敌人面前畏畏缩缩，屈服于敌人的强大的外表，在困难面前灰心丧气，被暂时的困难吓倒，那末，又怎能指望革命的胜利和工作的成功呢？应当说，藐视一切敌人（困难）的革命志气，是我们进行革命斗争和任何工作的先决条件。有了这个先决条件，才谈得上去战胜敌人和克服困难。
    如果说，在战略上藐视一切敌人是我们同右倾机会主义的基本分歧，那么，在战术上重视每个具体敌人则是我们同“左”倾冒险主义的基本分歧。“左”倾冒险主义者对于具体的敌人和困难不是采取实事求是、认真对待的态度，而是只凭主观愿望办事，脱离当时当地的客观实际，其结果是到处碰壁，头破血流。我们马克思主义者藐视一切敌人，同时又重视每一个敌人。我们有充分的决心和信心打倒敌人，同时又实事求是，认真分析敌人的长处和短处，认真估计我们自己的优点和缺点，认真考虑群众的觉悟程度，然后定出计划和步骤，充分发动群众的积极性，充分发挥我们自己的优点和克服缺点，充分利用敌人的短处和削弱或者避开它的长处，一步又一步地、一个又一个地消灭敌人。
    没有藐视一切敌人的气概，固然不能使革命达于成功；没有认真对待具体敌人的办法，同样也会使革命遭到失败。既要反对右倾保守，又要反对“左”倾盲动。而在目前，当我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设蓬勃发展的时候，反对右倾保守思想，提倡要有藐视一切敌人和困难的革命正气，提倡要有革命乐观主义和革命英雄主义，有着头等重要的实际意义。
