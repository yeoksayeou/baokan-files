Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 13th: Recent exploration materials prove that Siberia's mineral and hydroelectric resources are far greater than originally estimated. According to Jasnov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, in a recent reply to readers of the "Soviet Union" pictorial, Siberia's hydroelectric resources account for 90% of the Soviet Union's total, coal mines account for 88%, iron ore accounts for 50%, and non-ferrous metal mines account for 90%.

Previously, according to statistical materials, Siberia's hydroelectric resources accounted for 80% of the entire Soviet Union's, coal mines accounted for 75%, and the iron ore here, together with the iron ore in the Far East, accounted for 9.6% of the Soviet Union's proven iron ore reserves.

Jasnov said that the coal reserves here are very rich, and the coal seams in many areas can be mined in the open air, thus providing the country with very cheap fuel. The Kuznetsk Coal Basin alone produced 63.8 million tons of coal in 1956, which is more than twice the total annual output of Tsarist Russia in 1913. The Tunguska Coal Basin in Siberia is one of the world's largest coalfields, with proven coal reserves of hundreds of billions of tons.

Jasnov said that Siberia's hydroelectric resources are also very rich. In order to make full use of these resources, some of the world's largest hydroelectric power stations are now being built on the Angara River, the Irtysh River, and other rivers. In addition, these rivers have waterways with a total length of 100,000 kilometers that are navigable.

Speaking of the development prospects of Siberia, Jasnov said that we will turn Siberia into a powerful coal mining and electricity production base for the Soviet Union, vigorously develop its electrometallurgical industry, coal chemical industry, and electrochemical industry, and make it a major region for producing heat and electricity, as well as producing aluminum, magnesium, and titanium. He said that during the past few Five-Year Plans, a huge metallurgical industry has grown up here. For example, the Kuznetsk Integrated Iron and Steel Plant is one of the largest factories of its kind in the world, and this factory is still expanding. The West Siberian Iron and Steel Plant, which is currently under construction, will be even larger in scale.

Speaking of the speed of industrial development in Siberia, Jasnov cited the city of Novosibirsk as an example. He pointed out that the industrial enterprises in this city now produce in one month the same amount of products as the entire year of 1940. Now, this city has become a huge industrial center.

### 西伯利亚资源超过原来估计  煤藏占全苏88％　工业发展前途无量

    西伯利亚资源超过原来估计
    煤藏占全苏88％　工业发展前途无量
    新华社莫斯科13日电　最近的勘探材料证明，苏联西伯利亚的矿藏和水力资源大大超过了原来的估计。据俄罗斯联邦部长会议副主席雅斯诺夫最近在回答“苏联”画报读者的问题时说，西伯利亚的水力资源占全苏联水力资源的90％，煤矿占88％，铁矿占50％，有色金属矿占90％。
    而根据不久以前的统计材料，西伯利亚的水力资源占全苏联水力资源的80％，煤矿占75％，这里的铁矿和远东的铁矿加在一起一共占全苏联已经探明的铁矿储量的9.6％。
    雅斯诺夫说，这里的煤的蕴藏量非常丰富，而且许多地区的煤层都能够露天开采，因而可以供给国家非常便宜的燃料。单是库兹?茨克煤区1956年的采煤量就达六千三百八十万吨，这比沙皇俄国1913年全年的产量还多一倍以上。西伯利亚的通古斯煤区是世界最大煤区之一，目前已经探明的煤藏量就达几千亿吨。
    雅斯诺夫说，西伯利亚的水力资源也是非常丰富的，为了充分利用这些资源，现在正在安加拉河、额尔齐斯河等河流上建设一些世界上最大的水电站。此外，这些河流有总长度达十万公里的水道可以通航。
    在谈到西伯利亚的发展远景时，雅斯诺夫说，我们将把西伯利亚变成苏联强大的采煤和生产电力的基地，要大力发展这里的电冶金工业、煤化学工业和电化学工业，要使它成为生产热能和电能，以及生产铝、镁、钛的主要地区。他说，在过去的几个五年计划期间，这里的巨大冶金工业就已经成长起来了。如库兹?茨克联合钢铁厂就是世界上最大的同类工厂之一，这个工厂现在还在不断地扩大。目前正在建设的西西伯利亚钢铁工厂的规模还要大。
    在谈到西伯利亚工业发展速度时，雅斯诺夫举出了新西伯利亚城作为例子。他指出，目前这个城市的工业企业一个月内所生产的产品就等于1940年的全年产量。现在，这个城市已经成为一个巨大的工业中心。
