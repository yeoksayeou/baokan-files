    The Peculiar Flower of the New Year - The Plum Blossom
    Chen Junyu
    When flowers are mentioned, people always think of them as delicate plants. However, this is not entirely the case. In China's rich resources of ornamental plants, there are many flowers full of fighting spirit. They bud in the ice and bloom in the snow. They break the silence of early spring and bring people infinite hope and joy. The plum blossom is a famous flower with this character, so it has been admired by the world since ancient times, and it is placed alongside pine and bamboo, and is called "The Three Friends of Winter". "Of all the flowers, it dares to emerge in the snow, one tree blooming before all others under heaven." This is a wonderful portrayal of the plum blossom, and it also shows that the ancients loved the plum blossom precisely because they valued its fighting spirit.
    China is the only home of the plum blossom. This can be evidenced from ancient literature and modern scientific records. "Famous Doctors' Records" says: "Plum... grows in the valleys of Hanzhong." "Revising the Guangyuan County Chronicles" records: "Plum, there are wild ones in the mountains, generally single-petaled." In recent years, Chinese and foreign botanists have also collected specimens of plum blossom original species and variants in Yichang, Wenchuan, and the mountainous areas of Yunnan. Japanese scholars such as Mitsutaro Shirai also said that Japanese plum blossoms were introduced from China in ancient times. These facts fully demonstrate that plum blossoms originate in China, and also refute the erroneous arguments of British and American scholars about the origin of plum blossoms.
    We say that the plum blossom is a fine tree, not only because it is full of fighting spirit, but also because it has a particularly long flowering period, excellent color and fragrance, vigorous branches and trunks, and is full of vitality. Now that the New Year has just passed, plum blossoms in Guangdong and Guangxi are in full bloom, fine plum blossoms in Sichuan and Fujian are budding, and plum gardens in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Hubei are already pregnant with the news of spring.
    Plum blossom cultivation is not limited to the south of the Yangtze River, but also has traces of it in the Yellow River basin and even the northeast. In Luoyang, Kaifeng, and other areas, plum blossoms began to be planted since the Song and Yuan dynasties; now in Yanling, Henan, many farmers make a living by cultivating plum blossoms. Before the Ming Dynasty, there was no plum blossom cultivation in Beijing. Later, someone "moved it from the south of the Yangtze River and protected it with a poor hut" (see "Cessation of Tillage Records"), and since then the famous flowers of the south have thrived in the north.
    Plum blossoms are increasingly valued, also because of their ever-changing varieties. Although no one has yet conducted a comprehensive investigation and study of plum blossom varieties, it is estimated that there are more than two or three hundred species. According to the preliminary results of personal investigations in the Yangtze River basin for more than ten years, more than 150 kinds of plum blossoms have been discovered, which are classified into twelve major categories. Now, I will briefly introduce some of the most important and special types.
    "Gongfen", "Zhusha" and "Lüe" are three common types of plum blossoms. "Gongfen" has the most varieties, with pink flowers and excellent fragrance, like Wuxi's "Da Fen Mei" and Chongqing's "Da Gongfen", which are even more famous. "Zhusha" has purple-red flowers, which are extremely gorgeous, such as Sichuan's "Shui Zhusha" and "Fen Hong Taige Zhusha", which are particularly wonderful. "Lüe" has green sepals and white flowers, which are elegant and pleasing to the eye, and best embodies the beauty of "sparse shadows crossing obliquely, and subtle fragrance floating". Chengdu's "Jinqian Lüe" has a flower head that is almost an inch in size, with as many as fifty or sixty petals, which can be called a treasure among plum blossoms. "Zhaoshui", "Longyou" and "Sajin" are three relatively rare types. "Zhaoshui" has drooping branches and is best planted on the banks of rivers and ponds, so that the flowers and their shadows reflect each other to form a beautiful scene. "Longyou" naturally has twisted branches, shaped like dragons and snakes, and is a newly discovered exotic species. "Sajin" blooms with flowers of several colors on one tree, with various stripes and spots, changing in many ways, which is fascinating.
    People will ask: How are so many colorful flowers produced? In ancient times, people processed wild plum fruits for consumption, and then planted them in gardens, gradually producing various variations. It was not until the early Han Dynasty that double-petaled plum blossoms appeared. For example, in the Shanglin Garden, "Gongfen" and other plum blossom varieties were planted (see "Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital"). Wild single-petaled plum blossoms have become double-petaled treasures through long-term artificial introduction, cultivation and selection. This shows that China has at least two thousand years of plum blossom cultivation history.
    The plum blossom truly "became famous for its flowers" during the Southern and Northern Dynasties. At that time, many plum blossoms were planted in Nanjing, Yangzhou and other areas. Famous poets He Xun, Yin Keng and others all wrote poems about plum blossoms. By the Tang Dynasty, the trend of planting and chanting plum blossoms was in full swing, and types such as "Zhusha" and "Lüe" also began to be cultivated. The Song Dynasty was the heyday of plum blossom cultivation, the number of new species increased rapidly, and there was a "Plum Blossom Manual" to record the varieties at that time. For example, Fan Chengda recorded dozens of varieties in Suzhou in the "Plum Blossom Manual", including the "Yudie" and other types that had appeared not long ago.
    Many ancient writers have contributed to the recording and promotion of plum blossoms. Fan Chengda wrote the Plum Blossom Manual, and Zhang Gongfu wrote the Plum Blossom Appraisal, which are still important materials for studying plum blossoms. Du Fu wrote plum blossom poems, Bai Juyi wrote "Remembering Plum Blossom Poems in Hangzhou", and Su Dongpo planted and chanted plum blossoms in Hangzhou, Guangdong and other places. Lin Hejing built a hut on Gushan in West Lake, planted plum blossoms as his wife, and raised cranes as his sons. His unique life has been passed down as a beautiful story for thousands of years.
    Not only poets love plum blossoms, but ordinary citizens also love plum blossoms very much. People in the north often like to pot plum blossoms and camellias, so that they bloom indoors in the New Year. In addition, folk artists play "Three Variations of Plum Blossoms", and women wear "Plum Blossom Makeup"... From this it can be seen that plum blossoms are one of the themes in literature and art.

    新春的奇花——梅
  　陈俊愉
    一提到花，人们总会想到那是一种娇弱的植物。其实并不尽然，在我国丰富的供人观赏的植物资源里，有许多富于斗争性的花卉。它们在冰中孕蕾，雪里开花。它们打破了早春的岑寂，给人们带来无限的希望和欢欣。梅花就是具有这种性格的一种名花，因此，自古以来就为世人推崇，把它与松竹并列，称为“岁寒三友”。“万花敢向雪中出，一树独先天下春”这是对梅花的绝妙写照，也说明古人爱梅，正是看中它的斗争精神。
    我国是梅花唯一的故乡，这从古代文献资料和近代科学记载中都可得到明证。“名医别录”里说：“梅……生汉中川谷”。“重修广元县志”里记载：“梅，山中间有野生者，概单瓣。”近年中外植物学家在宜昌、汶川和云南山区，还采集到梅花原种和变种的标本。日本学者白井光太郎等也说日本的梅花是在古代由中国传入的。这些事实充分说明梅花产于我国，同时也批驳了英美学者对梅花原产地的错误论断。
    我们说梅花是嘉木，不仅因为它富于斗争性，而且还由于它花期特久，色香俱佳，枝干苍劲，生趣盎然。现在新年刚过，两广梅花正在盛开，四川和福建的梅花佳品正含苞待放，而江苏、浙江、湖南、湖北一带的梅园里，也已在孕育着春天的消息了。
    梅花栽培不仅限于江南，而且在黄河流域乃至东北地区，都有它的踪迹。在洛阳、开封一带，宋元以来就开始栽种梅花；现在河南鄢陵，还有不少农民以艺梅为业。明朝以前，北京没有梅花栽培。后来有人“从江南移至，护以穷庐”（见“辍耕录”），从此江南的名花才繁衍于北地。
    梅花日益为人重视，还由于它千变万化的品类。至今虽然还没有人对梅花的品种作过全面的调查研究，估计约在二三百种以上。根据十多年来个人在长江流域初步调查的结果，发现一百五十多种梅花，归为十二大类。现在，把其中最主要的和比较特殊的几种类型作一简单介绍。
    “宫粉”、“朱砂”和“绿萼”是我们常见的三类梅花。“宫粉类”品种最多，花色粉红，香韵俱佳，像无锡“大粉梅”、重庆“大宫粉”等，更是其中名种。“朱砂类”花色紫红，艳丽无比，如川中“水朱砂”、“粉红台阁朱砂”等尤为奇绝。“绿萼类”萼绿花白，雅淡可观，最能体现“疏影横斜，暗香浮动”之妙；而成都“金钱绿萼”花头大至寸许，花瓣多至五六十片以上，堪称梅中逸品。“照水”、“龙游”和“洒金”这三类是比较罕见的类型。“照水梅”枝条下垂，最宜种在河畔池边，让花朵和花影相映成趣。“龙游梅”生来枝条盘曲，状如龙蛇，是晚近发现的异品。“洒金梅”一树开数色花，带有各种条纹斑点，变幻多端，引人入胜。
    人们会问：这么多的万紫嫣红，到底它们是怎样产生的呢？在古代的时候，人们采取野生的梅实加工食用，以后栽入园中，逐渐产生了各种变异。到了汉初，才有重瓣梅花。像在上林苑中，就栽了“宫粉”等梅花品种（见“西京杂记”）。野生单瓣梅花通过长期的人工引种培育和选择，才变成重瓣佳品。这说明我国梅花栽培，至少有两千多年的历史了。
    梅之真正“以花闻天下”，是在南北朝的时候。当时在南京、扬州一带，种了不少梅花。名诗家如何逊、阴铿等人都有咏梅之作。到了唐朝，栽梅咏梅之风大盛，“朱砂”、“绿萼”等类型也开始培育了出来。宋代是梅花栽培的鼎盛时期，新种急遽增加，并有“梅谱”把当时的品种记录下来。像范成大在“梅谱”里，就记载了苏州几十个品种，其中还包括出现不久的“玉蝶”等类型。
    在梅花的记载和宣扬方面，很多古代文学家是有功绩的。范成大著梅谱，张功甫作梅品，至今仍是研究梅花的重要资料。杜甫著有梅花诗，白居易写过“忆杭州梅花诗”，苏东坡曾在杭州、广东等地栽梅咏梅。林和靖结庐西湖孤山，植梅为妻，畜鹤作子，他的别致生涯，传为千古佳话。
    不仅诗人爱梅，一般市民也非常爱梅。北地多喜盆栽梅椿，使之在新春在室内怒放。此外，像民间艺人奏的“梅花三弄”，妇女带的“梅花妆”……由此可见，梅花是文学艺术上的主题之一。
