    Zhejiang Handicraft Workers Help Farmers Repair Water Conservancy in a Timely Manner
    Processing on the Spot at Reservoirs and Raw Material Producing Areas
    Shandong Plans to Produce a Large Number of Power Machines and New-Style Farm Tools This Year
    (Our Newspaper News) According to the Zhejiang Daily report: Handicraft cooperative members in more than ten counties including Lanxi, Tangxi, Yiwu, Shaoxing, Changhua, Shengxian, and Pinghu, have gone to the reservoir construction sites and raw material producing areas to process various agricultural tools for farmers, ensuring that farmers can carry out water conservancy construction in a timely manner.
    Many handicraft cooperative members, after overcoming concerns about the hardship of living at reservoir construction sites and earning little money, competed to go to various reservoir construction sites to serve the farmers. The Changhua County Iron Industry Cooperative successively dispatched fifty-two experienced members with furnaces, iron hammers and other tools to various reservoir construction sites to repair hoes, iron bars and other agricultural tools for the farmers. The handicraft cooperative members of the iron, wood, and bamboo weaving industries in Tangxi County went to the Xiban Reservoir construction site in this county and processed and repaired 10,000 pairs of baskets and 400 hoes for the farmers.
    Recently, due to the drying up of rivers in some areas, it was difficult to transport mao bamboo from the producing areas in a timely manner. Many handicraft cooperative members went to the raw material producing areas to process semi-finished or finished products and then transport them out. The Chengguan, Luobu, Gufang, and Yangbu bamboo weaving cooperatives in Tangxi County dispatched fifty members to go deep into the mountainous areas to process a large number of baskets; the members of the bamboo weaving and woodworking handicraft cooperatives in Lanxi, Changhua, Shengxian, Longyou and other counties also went to the mountainous areas to process semi-finished products such as baskets and wooden buckets, and transported them out of the mountainous areas in a timely manner to supply the needs of water conservancy construction.
    (Our Newspaper News) Shandong Province's local industrial system plans to produce a large number of power machines and new-style farm tools this year to support large-scale agricultural production.
    According to the agricultural production plans and material strengths of various places this spring, Shandong's local industrial departments have initially determined to produce 24,700 horsepower of power machinery this year (including 13,000 horsepower of boiler-locomotive machines, 5,700 horsepower of gas engines, and 6,000 horsepower of diesel engines); 2,100 water pumps; 250,000 Type 56 Liberation water wheels; and 100,000 water wheel parts. In addition, there are 30,000 tons of ceramic pipes for water diversion and irrigation. If these power machines are calculated at 50 mu of land irrigated per horsepower and each water wheel irrigates 20 mu of land, a total of 6.23 million mu of land can be irrigated.
    In terms of new-style farm tools, it is planned to produce 500 cotton planters and 2,500 Soviet-style cultivators in the first quarter of this year.
    At the same time, in order to solve the difficulties in the repair and assembly of power machinery in rural areas, it is also planned to establish ten repair and assembly points to ensure that agricultural tools play their full role. (Gao Fusui)

    浙江手工业者及时帮助修水利的农民
    到水库和原料产区就地加工
    山东今年计划生产大批动力机械和新式农具
    本报讯　据浙江日报报道：兰溪、汤溪、义乌、绍兴、昌化、嵊县、平湖等十多个县的手工业社社员纷纷下水库工地和原料产区为农民加工各种农具，保证农民及时兴修水利。
    许多手工业社社员在克服了怕下水库工地生活艰苦、赚钱不多等思想以后，都争先到各水库工地为农民服务。昌化县铁业社先后派出五十二个有生产经验的社员带着炉子、铁锤等工具，到各水库工地去为农民修补锄头、铁撬等农具。汤溪县铁、木、篾业的手工业社社员到这个县的西坂水库工地为农民加工、修补了畚箕一万双和锄头四百把。
    最近，由于某些地区的河流干涸，产区毛竹难以及时运出，许多手工业社社员便到原料产区去加工半成品或成品再行运出。汤溪县城关、罗埠、古方、洋埠四个篾业社派出了五十个社员深入山区加工了大批畚箕；兰溪、昌化、嵊县、龙游等县的蔑、木业手工业社的社员也分头到山区加工畚箕、木桶等半成品，并及时运出山区，供应兴修水利的需要。
    本报讯　山东省地方工业系统今年计划生产大批动力机械和新式农具，支援农业大生产。
    根据各地今春的农业生产规划和物资力量，山东地方工业部门初步确定今年生产动力机械二万四千七百马力（其中有锅驼机一万三千马力、煤气机五千七百马力、柴油机六千马力）；水泵二千一百台；56式解放水车二十五万部；水车零件十万件。此外，还有引水灌溉所用的陶管三万吨。这些动力机械如按每马力灌溉五十亩土地、水车每部灌溉二十亩土地计算，共可浇地六百二十三万亩。
    新式农具方面，今年第一季度计划生产棉花播种机五百部、苏式中耕器二千五百部。
    同时，为了解决各地农村动力机械修配中的困难，还准备设立十个修配点，以保证农具充分发挥作用。　（高福绥）
