　　A One-Sided Transaction
　　Johnston, who was recently appointed to coordinate the US "aid" program, vigorously promoted the loan fund plan for developing underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa in a speech. After emphasizing the point that the American capitalist system can only survive through expansion, he blatantly declared that the United States is "buying" a world where American "free enterprise" can "grow and expand" by giving loans to new countries in Asia, Africa, and the Near East. Finally, he asked plausibly: "Is there a more cost-effective deal than this?"
　　If merely spending a few hundred million US dollars (last year's "Development Loan Fund" was 300 million, and it is planned to double this year) can turn the Asian and African regions into a world where American monopoly capital can "grow and expand," this deal is of course the most "cost-effective" for American billionaires. Unfortunately, since it is a transaction, there must be another party; will the awakened people of Asia and Africa allow this kind of transaction that harms their interests? Johnston and his ilk are being too wishful.

    一厢情愿的交易
    新近被任命负责协调美国“援”外计划的约翰斯顿，在一次演说中极力鼓吹关于开发亚非不发达国家的贷款基金计划。他在强调了美国资本主义制度只有扩张才能生存下去这一论点之后，露骨地宣称美国正在通过给亚洲、非洲和近东的新国家以贷款的方法，“来购买”一个使美国的“自由企业”能“生长着、扩张着的世界”。最后，他振振有词地问道：“还有比这更加合算的交易吗？”
    如果仅仅花费区区数亿美元（去年的“开发贷款基金”是三亿，今年准备增加一倍），就能把亚非地区变为可以让美国垄断资本在那里“生长着、扩张着的世界”，这笔交易对美国亿万富翁们当然是再“合算”也没有的。可惜，既然是交易，就得有另一方；觉悟了的亚非人民会允许进行这种危害他们利益的交易吗？约翰斯顿之流未免是太一厢情愿了。
