Confirmation
——A Rickshaw Puller's Impression of the Stage Play "Camel Xiangzi"
　　Qiu Yang
　　Last December, the Beijing People's Art Theatre staged "Camel Xiangzi" at the Experimental Theatre. One day, a peculiar scene appeared in front of the theater: a large number of pedicabs. Among them were many flatbed tricycles, as well as passenger tricycles, carrying audiences dressed in new clothes. At the theater entrance, the audience went in, and so did the drivers. The situation inside the theater was also different from usual. The audience responded with unusual enthusiasm, frequently expressing approval: "That's right!" "That's how it was!" A small gesture or line on stage elicited a very different reaction than usual. After the play ended, many audience members did not leave the theater but went to the lounge. The actors also went. There were not enough seats, so everyone looked around for chairs, stools, and anything that could be used as a seat. The lounge was soon packed.
　　One audience member stood up and said, "Everyone who came to see the play today is Xiangzi." His words were met with laughter, because today was a chartered performance by the Xisi District Tricycle Workers' Union.
　　The rickshaw pullers' interest in this play did not begin that day. As early as when the play was first staged and the stills were placed in the display window, a rickshaw puller named Du Jingduo (who had recently changed professions) wrote a letter to the theater. He was excited that a work depicting the life of rickshaw pullers had appeared on the stage. In his letter, he described the tragic life of rickshaw pullers in the past, which many people were not aware of, and enthusiastically offered many suggestions regarding the costumes and other details in the stills. The theater invited him to see the play, and he wrote a second letter, which was published on the eighth page of the People's Daily on New Year's Eve last year.
　　He was not the only one with this enthusiasm. Many rickshaw pullers were interested in this play. The Xisi District Union contacted the theater to arrange a chartered performance. Many rickshaw pullers, who had never been to a theater in their lives, pedaled their own vehicles, carrying their wives, children, and elderly parents, dressed in new clothes, as if attending a grand ceremony, and entered the theater. In a few short hours, they relived the past decades of their lives that they were about to forget. How many things surged into their hearts, and how many words they longed to pour out.
　　Zhu Chonghe, who had been pulling a rickshaw for more than thirty years, sighed and said, "We've never been to a theater before. In the past, it was for the rich." Many people nodded silently. Yang Wenxiang continued, "What kind of era was that? Today, the whole regime has changed. Back then, Xiangzi bought several vehicles, but they were all swindled or robbed. But now, the vehicles are our own. Even if you leave them on the street, they won't disappear. No one dares to touch them!" Wang Zhongdai, who is in his forties, has been pulling a rickshaw his whole life and is now a district representative and assessor, said, "We can't forget the past!" Yes, the past was truly a nightmare. Being beaten and scolded was commonplace for rickshaw pullers. A young man surnamed Shi said, "Xiangzi pulling ammunition and losing his vehicle is so true. I experienced that too. The Kuomintang army forced you to pull ammunition. If you didn't, they would beat you to death. Like Xiangzi, I ran away. Fortunately, I didn't lose my vehicle. What if I had lost it? You couldn't earn even a pound of mixed flour from a trip. How many fares could you get in a day!" Chang Xiansheng, who has been pulling a rickshaw for more than forty years, was beaten and scolded by warlords. Those wearing leather boots would kick you in addition to hitting you. When waiting for fares at the station, you couldn't bargain. He tried to bargain once, and someone came up and slapped him hard across the face. Zhao Yu sighed and said, "This isn't something that happened thirty years ago. It was like this before liberation. No one treated rickshaw pullers like human beings! They all thought rickshaw pullers were bad people." Reactionary soldiers and police beat rickshaw pullers, chasing after those who ran away while sitting in the rickshaws, and beating them again when they caught up. Or they would tear off your license plate and find you to beat you, often half to death. An elderly man who now works in the cleaning crew said heavily, "I'm like Old Ma in the play, but I'm better off than him. I've caught up with good times. Talking about the past is a book of blood debts that we can't forget!" In the past, rickshaw pullers had three urgent problems: the first was not getting fares; the second was not being able to eat; and the third was not being able to pay the vehicle rent. The exploiters of the old society jointly spread a net that made it difficult for rickshaw pullers to survive. Moreover, some people even composed songs to insult them: "How beautiful is the rickshaw puller, a foreign mule with two legs, doesn't eat bran or fodder, knows all the twists and turns."
　　The topic turned to today. Many young rickshaw pullers have transferred to factories. Some have gone to Anshan Iron and Steel, and some drive trams. Their children have all entered school, and some have even gone to study in the Soviet Union. "In the past, our life was buckwheat noodles and corn cakes. We still eat them now, but we treat them as a rarity! In the past, we drank cold water, but now—beer!" Right-wingers have said that people's lives have not improved. Ma Wenbin said, "We have to be reasonable about this. Some people have not improved, like the former puppet army commanders and company commanders. They shouldn't improve, and they can't improve, because they are lazy and don't work. There was a puppet army officer who is now pulling a rickshaw, but he doesn't do it properly. His vehicle is always so dirty. I asked him, 'Can't you clean it up a bit?' He said, 'Who am I showing it to?' He is not convinced. He puts his clothes on the vehicle, arranging them like a cross. I asked him, 'What are you doing?' He said, 'Isn't this like Jesus carrying the cross!'" Let him carry it. This "Jesus" of his will never "resurrect."
　　Everyone expressed satisfaction with the adaptation of the script, especially liking the ending where Xiangzi did not fall into depravity but followed the workers towards a new life. They said, "It should be like this. That's how we are!" An elderly man disagreed with the plot of Er Qiangzi selling his daughter. He believed that selling children did happen, but those who sold them felt ashamed and would not resort to it unless they were driven to the end of their rope. Everyone felt that the oppression and exploitation of the warlords and owners should be written more concretely, so that people would understand why Er Qiangzi had to sell his daughter. Just writing about Sun San's tyranny is not enough to summarize the situation. In addition, everyone also introduced the diverse and ingenious ways that rickshaw pullers adopted when fighting against the owners, not letting the owners take advantage, yet leaving them helpless!
　　It was late at night, but everyone was reluctant to leave. A small child came in and called out, "Dad, Mom is getting anxious." An elderly man smiled and said apologetically, "I have to go. I still have to pedal them back!" Everyone laughed.
　　The meeting ended. It was a meeting for giving opinions, and also a meeting for educating the performers. These witnesses of history confirmed the achievements of this play, enriched the play's re-creation work, and also gave the theater an opportunity to contact a group of audience members who had not been fully noticed. It also allowed the rickshaw pullers to open up a new cultural and recreational field. Starting from January 14th this year, they will continue to charter several performances. Don't think that rickshaw pullers only like to watch "Camel Xiangzi." They also requested to charter "The Man with the Gun"! Let our drama take root and blossom among the masses at the grassroots level!

    印证
    ——记三轮车工人看话剧“骆驼祥子”
    丘扬
    去年12月，北京人民艺术剧院在实验剧场演出“骆驼祥子”，有一天，剧场门前出现了一个奇特的景象：三轮车特别多。其中有不少是平板三轮车，也有不少客运三轮车，车上坐的是穿新衣的观众。到剧场门口，观众进去了，蹬车的也进去了。剧场内的情况也和往常不一样，观众反应特别热烈，不时发出赞许的声音：“够样！”“是那么回事！”舞台上一个小动作或是一句台词，都引起了与平常大不相同的反应。戏散了，许多观众没离开剧场，却到休息室去了，演员们也去了，座位不够，大家四处找椅子、凳子及一切可以用来当座位的东西，休息室顿时挤得满满的。
    一个观众站起来说：“今天来看戏的，都是祥子。”话声未落，笑声四起，因为今天是西四区三轮工会包场。
    三轮车工人不是从这天起才开始注意这出戏的，早在戏初上演，剧照刚刚摆在橱窗里的时候，一位名叫杜晶铎的三轮工人（近年才改业）就向剧院写来一封信，他为舞台上出现了描写车夫生活的作品而兴奋。信中，他道出了许多人不大知道的过去车夫的悲惨生活，并且热情地就剧照中的服饰等，提了许多意见。剧院请他看了戏，他又写来了第二封信，去年除夕，这封信在人民日报第八版发表了。
    不只是他一个人有这种热情，许许多多三轮车工人都对这出戏有兴趣，西四区工会向剧院接洽包场，许多一辈子从没有进过话剧场的三轮车工人，蹬着自己的车，拉着妻儿老小，着新衣，像是参加一个隆重的典礼似地，进入了剧场。在短短的几小时中，他们重温了将要遗忘掉的过去几十年的生活，有多少事涌上他们的心头，又有多少话渴望着倾吐。
    拉了三十几年车的朱崇和，慨叹地说：“我们从来就没进过话剧院子，过去，那是有钱人看的。”不少人在默默地点着头。杨文祥接着说：“那是什么年月？今天政权整个变了，那时，祥子买了几次车都被骗走、抢走了，可现在，车都是自己的，扔在马路上也没不了，没人敢动！”四十多岁的王中代，拉了一辈子车，如今是区代表、陪审员，他说：“也不能忘掉过去啊！”是的，过去，那真是一场噩梦。挨打，受骂，成了车夫的家常便饭，一位姓史的年轻人说：“祥子拉子弹丢车，太对了，我就赶上过。国民党军队逼着你拉子弹，不拉就揍个死。跟祥子一样，我跑了，幸运的是没丢了车，丢了车怎么办？拉一趟车挣不上一斤杂合面，一天能拉几个座！”常献生拉了四十多年车，军阀打骂受过，穿皮靴的是连打加踢；在车站等座，不能讲价钱。他讲了一次价，人家上来就是一个大嘴巴。赵玉慨叹地说：“这不是什么三十年前的事，解放前就是这样，谁拿着拉车的当人啊！都觉得拉车的没好东西。”反动军警打车夫，打的人家跑了，坐着车追，追上再打，要不然扯下号坎，找着你打，一打就是半死。一位现在在清洁队工作的老者沉重地说：“我就是戏里那个老马，可我比他强，我赶上好年月了。讲过去，那是一本血账，忘不了啊！”过去，车夫们有三急：一急拉不上座；二急吃不上饭；三急交不上车份。旧社会的剥削者联合撒了一张网，使车夫难以活命。而且，有些人还编了歌谣辱骂他们：“拉洋车的怎么那么美，外国的骡子两条腿，不吃麸子不吃料，拐弯抹角全知道。”
    话题转向了今天，许多青年三轮车工人转进了工厂，有的上了鞍钢，有的开电车，他们的子弟都入了学，有的甚至到苏联去留学了，“从前我们的生活是荞麦面、贴饼子，现在也吃，但是拿着当希罕吃！从前喝凉水，可现在——啤酒！”右派分子曾说人民生活没提高，马文斌说：“这可得讲讲理，有的人是没有提高，过去的伪军长、连长没提高，他们不该提高，也提不高，因为他们懒着不干。有个伪军官，现在蹬三轮了，可是不好好地干，车子老那么脏，我问他，你不能弄得干净点吗！他说，给谁看啊！他是不服气，他把衣服摆在车上，摆得像个十字架，我问他这是干嘛？他说这不跟耶稣背十字架一样！”让他背吧，他这个“耶稣”，一辈子也“复活”不了。
    大家对剧本的改编都表示满意，特别喜欢祥子最后没有堕落，跟着工人走向新生活的处理，他们说，“该这样，我们就是这样！”一个老年人，不大同意二强子卖女儿的情节，他认为卖儿卖女是有的，但卖的人都觉得丢人，而且不被逼到毫无生路不会出此下策的。大家都觉得，应该把军阀、车主的压迫、剥削写得再具体些，那样才会使人明白二强子为什么要卖女儿，光写孙三一个人的强横是不容易概括的。另外，大家也介绍了许多车夫向车主们斗争时，所采取的多样的智慧的方式，不让车主占便宜，可又使他们没办法！
    夜深了，大家可都不肯离开，一个小娃娃进来喊：“爸爸，妈等急了。”一位老者笑了，歉然地说：“我得走了，还得把他们蹬回去！”大家都笑了。
    会结束了，是个提意见的会，也是个教育演出人员的会，这些历史的证人，证实了这出戏的成就，丰富了这出戏的再创造工作，同时也使剧院有机会接触了一群未被充分注意的观众，也使得三轮车工人们开辟了一个新的文娱领域。今年1月14日起，他们还继续包几场。别以为三轮车工人们只喜欢看“骆驼祥子”，他们还要求包“带枪的人”呢！让我们的话剧在基层群众中生根开花吧！
