    The People's Daily News Agency — The 91 state-owned farms planting cotton nationwide in 1957 achieved an average yield of 64 jin of ginned cotton per mu across 650,000 mu of cotton fields, a quarter increase compared to 1956. Among them, 65 farms reached the production targets of 40, 60, 80, and 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft).

    Among these farms, the four state-owned farms that reached the 100 jin ginned cotton production target were Shuangjiang in Yunnan, Xiaoguai and Maigaiti in Xinjiang, and Gaocun in Shanxi.

    The main reasons why these 60-plus farms achieved bumper harvests were the implementation of various yield-increasing measures and the improvement of cultivation techniques. The cotton farms of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, despite being severely affected by spring cold and summer drought, adopted innovative measures such as cross-ditch cultivation and infiltration irrigation with the strong assistance of Soviet experts. Cotton still achieved a bumper harvest, with an average yield of 68.8 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 18.7% compared to last year.

    国营农场棉花产量显著提高
  本报讯　1957年全国九十一个种植棉花的国营农场，六十五万亩棉田每亩平均产皮棉六十四斤，比1956年产量提高四分之一。其中有六十五个场分别达到全国农业发展纲要（草案）规定的四十、六十、八十、一百斤皮棉的生产指标。
    在这些农场中，达到百斤皮棉生产指标的，有云南的双江，新疆的小拐、麦盖提，山西的高村等四个国营农场。
    这六十多个达到纲要指标的农场，获得丰收的主要原因都是由于贯彻了各项增产措施，提高了耕作技术。新疆生产建设兵团的棉花农场，虽遭受春寒夏旱严重影响，但在苏联专家的大力协助下，采用了横沟中耕、浸润灌溉等革新措施，棉花仍然获得丰收，平均每亩产皮棉六十八点八斤，比去年提高18.7％。
