    Turning Millions of Mu of Lean and Barren Land into Fertile Fields
    Bijie Prefecture Implements Soil Revolution
    (By Our Newspaper Correspondent) According to a report in the Guizhou Daily: Collective farmers of all ethnic groups in Bijie Prefecture, Guizhou Province, will launch a massive soil improvement campaign based on the significant achievements made in soil improvement during the First Five-Year Plan. The entire prefecture plans to improve 1.47 million mu of soil this winter and spring, exceeding the total soil improvement during the First Five-Year Plan by 19%. After the improvement of these thin and poor-quality lands, it is estimated that each mu will increase production by 13%, resulting in an increased grain output of more than 19 million jin in 1958.
    Soil improvement is one of the important measures for farmers of all ethnic groups in this prefecture to achieve the grain production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program. Since mid-November of last year, various counties have been summarizing and exchanging the successful experiences of agricultural cooperatives in improving soil and increasing grain production over the past few years at winter production activist conferences or veteran farmer symposiums. According to preliminary statistics, during the First Five-Year Plan, farmers of all ethnic groups in the prefecture improved more than 1.2 million mu of lean, thin, and acidic soil by adopting methods such as importing soil, pit application, and spreading lime, increasing grain production by more than 28 million jin based on the original output. In 1957, the 495,000 mu of farmland that was improved increased grain production by 10.44 million jin. The Liangshan Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Zhuopu Township, Weining County, which is located in a high-altitude and cold area with thin soil, originally had more than 1,600 mu of barren land that could not grow corn. In 1956, after improvement with lime, nitrate ash, rock ash, fertile mud, forest leaves, and importing soil, although threatened by droughts in the spring, floods in the summer, and rains in the autumn last year, the average yield per mu was still 140 jin of corn, an increase of nearly two times compared to before soil improvement (when only buckwheat was produced). Local farmers said: "On the slopes of Zhuopu, we suffered from eating buckwheat. Since the Communist Party came, lean soil has become fertile and produces corn." The Yema Agricultural Cooperative in Hezhang County spread fertile mud on five mu of yellow soil in the winter before last – applying 28,000 jin of fertile mud per mu. Last year's yield doubled compared to the previous year. Many other cooperatives have also adopted the method of digging and collecting fertile mud for pit application in small spring fields, with very significant production increases. For example, the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Haizijie, Bijie County, spent more than 100 workdays digging and transporting more than 400 loads of fertile pond mud to apply to the lean spring fields on the slopes after the spring sowing last year. Not only did the spring crop increase production, but the corn also achieved a bumper harvest.
    By summarizing their experiences and studying the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), agricultural cooperatives in various places have strengthened their determination and confidence in soil improvement and have formulated soil improvement plans, which generally greatly exceed the planned targets set by higher authorities. For example, the 1,140 agricultural cooperatives in 14 districts and towns of Weining County plan to improve 200,400 mu of soil by this spring using methods such as lime, fertile mud, sea soil, green manure, and importing soil, exceeding the county's planned number by 155%; and while carrying out water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns, they have launched soil improvement campaigns one after another. According to statistics from approximately 200 cooperatives in Weining, Bijie, Dading, Jinsha, and other counties, more than 1.35 million jin of lime have already been burned, and more than 500 mu of soil have been improved by digging fertile mud, pond mud, sea soil, and leaves for pit application and spreading.

    把百万亩瘦薄的土地变成良田
    毕节专区实行土址革命
    本报讯　据贵州日报报道：贵州省毕节专区各族集体农民，将在第一个五年计划期间改良土壤取得巨大成绩的基础上，展开一个规模巨大的土壤改良运动。全区计划冬春改良土壤一百四十七万亩，比第一个五年计划改良土壤总和还大19％。这些土质瘦薄的土地经过改良后，预计每亩以增产13％计算，1958年就可增产粮食一千九百多万斤。
    土壤改良是这个专区各族农民实现农业发展纲要规定的粮食增产指标的重要措施之一。从去年11月中旬以来，各县在冬季生产积极分子大会或老农座谈会上，总结交流了几年来各地农业社改良土壤增产粮食的成功经验。据初步统计，第一个五年计划期间，全区各族农民采用客土法、窝施和撒施石灰等办法改良瘦薄酸性的土壤就达一百二十多万亩，在原有基础上增产粮食二千八百多万斤。1957年改良的四十九万五千亩田土，就增产粮食一千零四十四万斤。地居高寒、土质瘦薄的威宁县灼圃乡凉山农林牧生产社，原有一千六百多亩瘦地不出包谷，1956年用石灰、硝灰、岩灰、肥泥、森林木叶和客土法改良后，去年虽在春旱、夏涝、秋雨等灾害威胁下，平均每亩仍收包谷一百四十斤，较改良土壤前（只产荞子）增产近两倍。当地农民说：“灼圃皮坡上，苦命吃荞子，自从来了共产党，瘦土变肥出包谷。”赫章县野马农业社前年冬季用肥泥撒施的五亩黄壤地——每亩施肥泥二万八千斤，去年产量比前年增加一倍。还有不少合作社采用挖集肥泥窝施小春地的办法，增产效果都很显著。如毕节县海子街东方红农业社，在去年小春播种结束后，花了一百多个工挖运肥塘泥四百多挑，施在皮坡瘦地的小春地里，不但小春增了产，同时包谷也获得了丰收。
    各地农业社在通过总结经验和学习全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），增强了土壤改良的决心和信心，制定了改良土壤的规划，一般都大大超过了上级的计划指标。如威宁县十四个区镇的一千一百四十个农业社，计划到今春用石灰、肥泥、海土、压青、客土法等办法，改良土壤二十万零四千亩，超过县规划数的155％；并在开展兴修水利、积肥运动的同时，纷纷掀起了土壤改良运动。据威宁、毕节、大定、金沙等县约二百多个合作社的统计，已经烧石灰一百三十五万多斤，挖肥泥、塘泥、海土、木叶等窝施、撒施改良土壤五百多亩。
