    A Highway is Soon to be Built in Jinggangshan
    The first highway leading to the revolutionary cradle of Jinggangshan, the Taihe-Jinggangshan Highway, is about to commence construction. According to the design, the highway will be 110 kilometers long. It starts from Shangtian Township, three kilometers away from Taihe County, passes through places like Nashan in Yongxin County to the foot of Jinggangshan, and then winds its way up to Tongmu Ridge, one of the five major sentry posts where the Red Army defended Jinggangshan, over 300 meters high, and enters Ciping Village, the center of Jinggangshan where Chairman Mao once lived. The road surface will be entirely paved with sand and gravel.
    Li Liankui, the younger brother of Red Army soldier Li Qinkui and a master of mountain songs, composed a mountain song expressing the joy of the people of Jinggangshan upon hearing this news: A great happy event has come to the mountain, there are endless words in my heart to say, Commander Zhu used to carry rice on his shoulders, in the future cars will pass through Tongmu Pass. Thanks to the good leadership of the Party, Chairman Mao's care is boundless.

    井冈山即将修公路
    通往革命摇篮井冈山的第一条公路太和——井冈山公路即将动工兴建。根据设计，公路全长一百一十公里。它起自距离泰和县城三公里的上田乡，经过永新县的拿山等地到井冈山下，然后蜿蜒盘上高达三百多公尺、当年红军坚守井冈山的五大哨口之一——桐木岭，进入井冈山的中心、毛主席曾经住过的茨坪村。路面将全部采用沙石铺设。
    红军战士李芹奎的弟弟、山歌能手李连奎听到这一消息以后，编了一首山歌表示井冈山人民的喜悦：天大喜事上了山，心里有话说不完，朱军长过去肩挑米，今后汽车要过桐木关。感谢党的好领导，毛主席关怀深无边。
