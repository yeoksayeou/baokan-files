    Putting Private Merchant Operations Under National Planning
    Vietnam Begins Unified Control of the Grain Market
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 7th. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has recently begun to implement unified control of the grain and rice market by state-owned trading organizations in the three cities of Hanoi, Haiphong, and Hong Gai. After a considerable period, this measure will be universally promoted throughout northern Vietnam.
    After the implementation of unified control over the grain and rice market, the state-owned grain and rice retail networks and procurement networks in the above three cities will be further expanded. Besides some switching to other occupations, the remaining thousands of private rice merchants and small rice vendors are undergoing preliminary transformation through means such as consignment sales, agency purchases, and temporary employment. In this way, the phenomenon of private merchants freely transporting grain and rice and blindly transporting grain and rice into the cities will be reduced and gradually disappear.
    According to sources in the Vietnamese Ministry of Commerce, this is an important measure taken by Vietnam in economic management. It will further stabilize rice prices, eliminate the serious tax evasion by illegal merchants when buying and selling grain and rice, and place a large number of private rice merchants under the control of national planned operations.
    In recent years, disregarding the regulations of the relevant government departments prohibiting the free transport of grain and rice and the suppression of grain and rice purchase prices, unscrupulous merchants in northern Vietnam have purchased large quantities of grain and rice in rural areas at prices more than 10% lower than the state purchase price, and then transported it into the cities for sale, causing losses to farmers and affecting rice prices.

    把私商经营纳入国家计划
    越南开始统一管制谷物市场
    新华社河内7日电　越南民主共和国最近开始在河内、海防和鸿广这三个城市中实行国营贸易机构对谷、米市场的统一管制。经过相当时期以后，这一措施将在越南北方各地普遍推广。
    对谷、米市场实行统一管制以后，上述三个城市的国营谷、米零售纲和收购纲将进一步扩大。成千户的私营米商和经营大米的小商贩除了部分转业以外，其余的正在通过代销、代购和暂时雇用等方式接受初步的改造。这样，私商自由运转谷、米和盲目地把谷、米运入城市的现象将要减少和逐步消失。
    据越南商业部人士说，这是越南在经济管理方面采取的一项重要措施。它将进一步稳定米价，杜绝不法商人买卖谷、米时严重的漏税行为，并且把大量私营米商置于国家计划经营的管制之下。
    近几年来，越南北方的不法商人不顾政府有关部门关于禁止自由转运谷、米和压价收购谷、米的规定，以低于国家收购价格10％以上的价钱在农村中大量收购谷、米，然后运入城市出卖，使农民受到损失，而且影响了米价。
