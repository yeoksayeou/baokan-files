    Beriberi and Thiamine
    Lü Zhirong
    In Han Yu's "Memorial for Twelfth Brother", there is a sentence: "People in Jiangnan often suffer from soft leg disease." The soft leg disease mentioned here is beriberi. It can be seen that beriberi was already prevalent in China during the Tang Dynasty, especially in the South. Beriberi was also prevalent in areas such as Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In 1882, the Japanese Navy sailed overseas, and 129 sailors contracted beriberi during the voyage, 29 of whom died as a result. Why was beriberi so prevalent in these Eastern countries? No one knew at the time.
    In 1896, the Dutch doctor Eijkman discovered in Java that chickens that had been eating polished white rice for a long time suffered from symptoms similar to human beriberi. After switching to brown rice, the disease was cured. At the same time, he observed the prisoners in the Java prison in detail. Many people who ate polished white rice suffered from beriberi, while few who ate brown rice suffered from beriberi. From this, Eijkman first believed that rice bran contained some unknown factor necessary for maintaining life, which could prevent and treat beriberi. In 1910, the Polish scholar Funk extracted this substance from rice bran, which was later named vitamin B1. Because its molecule contains sulfur and amino groups, it is also called thiamine.
    The reason why beriberi is so common in southern China, Japan, and Southeast Asia is that residents in these areas are accustomed to using polished white rice as their staple food.
    Why do people get beriberi when they lack thiamine? This is because thiamine can promote the metabolism of carbohydrates in the human body, and carbohydrates are the main nutrients of nerve tissue. Therefore, when thiamine is lacking, pyruvate, the intermediate product of carbohydrate metabolism, cannot be oxidized into carbon dioxide and water. As a result, the content of pyruvate in nerve tissue and blood increases, causing multiple neuritis, which causes people to suffer from beriberi.
    Beriberi develops gradually. In the initial stage, patients often only have symptoms such as poor appetite, easy fatigue, mental and physical unease, and weight loss. In severe cases, the lower limbs feel heavy, muscles are sore and atrophy, the skin loses sensation, hands and feet are spasm, lower limbs are paralyzed or even paralyzed. Sometimes there is edema in the lower limbs and chest and abdomen; eventually, death can occur due to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.
    Loss of appetite can be regarded as a characteristic of thiamine deficiency. When the human body lacks thiamine, the secretion of gastrointestinal fluid decreases, gastric acid decreases, and intestinal peristalsis slows down, which hinders food digestion, resulting in poor appetite.
    In addition to preventing and treating beriberi, increasing appetite and helping digestion, thiamine can also promote children's growth, promote milk secretion, and maintain reproductive functions.
    The human body's need for thiamine is related to age, weight, labor intensity, energy needs, and the amount of carbohydrate foods consumed. Generally speaking, adults need about 1.5-1.8 mg per day, pregnant women need about 1.8 mg, lactating mothers need about 2.0 mg, and infants and young children need about 0.4-0.8 mg. In addition, eating more carbohydrates, heavy physical labor, high temperature, fever or inflammation, the need for thiamine is increased.
    Thiamine is easily absorbed by the human body. Excess thiamine can be excreted in the urine within a few hours and cannot be stored in the body, so the human body should obtain a certain amount of thiamine from food every day.
    Foods with high thiamine content are mostly grains and meats that are eaten daily, so it is not difficult to obtain a certain amount of thiamine every day. Foods such as millet, corn, millet flour, corn flour, brown rice, buckwheat flour, naked oat flour, soybeans, green beans, peas, lean pork, and animal organs are rich sources of thiamine. Dry yeast has a particularly high thiamine content. However, fruits and vegetables do not have high thiamine content. If adults eat half a catty of millet or twelve taels of corn flour every day, they can get enough thiamine. However, thiamine is mainly distributed in the bran and germ of grains, so the content of thiamine in polished white rice and refined white flour with more bran removed is very low. Some people believe that improving life means eating more refined grains. This view is wrong. The thiamine content in refined white flour is only one-eighth of that of standard flour, and the content in refined white rice is only one-seventh of that of brown rice, while the content in ordinary machine-milled rice is only one-fifth of that of millet. In order to obtain enough thiamine, we should eat more coarse grains, brown rice, and flour with more bran. This can not only meet the nutritional needs of the human body, but also save food. It can be said to be the best of both worlds.
    Thiamine is soluble in water, can be destroyed by heat, is especially afraid of alkali, but is not afraid of acid. It will not be destroyed even if heated in acidic liquid. Therefore, the following points should be paid attention to when cooking: do not rub the rice with your hands when washing the rice, do not add alkali when cooking porridge, and do not use the method of scooping rice, so as to avoid loss of thiamine.

### 脚气病和硫胺素

    脚气病和硫胺素
    吕志荣
    在韩愈祭十二郎文中有过这样一句话：软脚病“江南之人，常常有之”，这里说的软脚病，就是脚气病。可见脚气病在唐朝时候就已经在我国流行，特别是在南方。在日本、印度尼西亚、菲律宾等地区，脚气病也很流行。1882年日本海军出洋远航，在途中有一百二十九名水兵患脚气病，其中有二十九人竟因此而死亡。为什么脚气病会在这些东方国家中流行呢？当时是没有人知道的。
    1896年荷兰医生艾克曼，在爪哇发现长期吃精白米的鸡患着与人类脚气病相似的症状。在改喂糙米以后，病就好了。同时他又详细地观察了爪哇监狱中的犯人，吃精白米的人患脚气病的很多，而吃糙米的人患脚气病的却很少。由此，艾克曼首先认为在米糠中含有维持生命所必需的某种未知因素，它能防治脚气病。到1910年，波兰学者冯克从米糠中提出这种物质，以后被命名为维生素B1，它的分子中含有硫和氨基，因此也叫硫胺素。
    脚气病所以在中国南方、日本以及东南亚等国很普遍，是因为这些地区的居民习惯以精白米作为主食。
    为什么人体在缺少硫胺素时会生脚气病呢？这是因为硫胺素在人体内能促进醣（碳水化合物）的新陈代谢，而醣是神经组织的主要营养素。因此在硫胺素缺乏时，醣代谢的中间产物——丙酮酸，就不能被氧化成二氧化碳和水，于是在神经组织和血液中丙酮酸的含量增高，因而引起多发性神经炎，使人患脚气病。
    脚气病是逐渐发生的。在初起时，病人往往只有胃口不好，容易疲劳，身心不安，体重减轻等现象；严重时，下肢感觉沉重，肌肉疼痛萎缩，皮肤失去知觉，手足痉挛，下肢麻痹甚至瘫痪；有时下肢和胸腹部水肿；最后可以因为心脏肥大、心力衰竭而死亡。
    食欲减退可以看作硫胺素缺乏病的特征。当人体缺少硫胺素时，胃肠分泌液减少，胃酸降低，肠蠕动减慢，使食物消化受阻，因而胃口不佳。
    硫胺素除了能防治脚气病，增进食欲和帮助消化之外，还能促进儿童生长，促进乳汁分泌以及维持生殖机能等。
    人体对硫胺素的需要量与年龄、体重、劳动强度、热能需要以及吃醣类食物的多少均有关系。一般来说，成人每日约需1.5—1.8毫克，孕妇约需1.8毫克，乳母约需2.0毫克，婴幼儿约需0.4—0.8毫克。此外吃醣较多，重体力劳动，高温、发烧或患炎症时，硫胺素的需要量都增高。
    硫胺素很容易被人体吸收。过多的硫胺素可在数小时内随尿排出体外，并不能储藏在身体内，因此人体应该每天从食物中取得一定量的硫胺素。
    含硫胺素较多的食物大多是日常所吃的粮食和肉类等，因此每天获得一定量的硫胺素并不困难。像小米、玉米、小米面、玉米面、糙米、荞麦面、莜麦面、黄豆、青豆、豌豆以及瘦猪肉、动物脏腑等，都是硫胺素的丰富来源。干酵母中硫胺素的含量尤高。但在水果和蔬菜中，硫胺素含量不高。如果成人每天吃半斤小米或十二两玉米面，就可以得到足够的硫胺素。不过硫胺素主要分布在谷皮和谷胚中，因此在去糠去麸较多的精白米和精白面中硫胺素的含量非常低，有些人认为提高生活，首先是多吃细粮，这种看法是错误的。精白面中硫胺素的含量只及标准粉的八分之一，精白米中的含量只及糙米的七分之一，而一般机米中的含量也只相当于小米的五分之一。为了获得足够的硫胺素，我们应当多吃粗粮、糙米和含麸较多的面粉，这样不但可以满足人体的营养需要，还能节省粮食，可以说是两全其美。
    硫胺素的特性是能溶于水，遇热能被破坏，特别怕碱，但不怕酸，在酸液中虽经加热也不会被破坏。因此在烧饭时应注意以下几点：洗米时不要用手搓，煮粥时不要加碱，不用捞饭的方法，以免硫胺素受到损失。
