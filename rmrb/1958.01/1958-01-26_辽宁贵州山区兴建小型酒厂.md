    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 24th: Service departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Liaoning Province are actively utilizing wild plants and discarded fruits from mountainous areas as raw materials for winemaking, planning to produce 5,000 tons of white liquor using these substitute materials this year. Completing this plan will not only save the state over 10,600 tons of grain but also increase sideline income for farmers.
    Thirty-three cities and counties in Liaoning Province are mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, with a large number of wild plants growing there. According to preliminary statistics, there are 39 kinds of substitute raw materials that can be used for winemaking, such as acorns, wild apricots, Solomon's seal, pig tail vegetables, wild sweet potatoes, wild soybeans, and various substandard and discarded fruits.
    Since the fourth quarter of last year, service departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have vigorously assisted agricultural cooperatives in establishing small wineries using wild plants. In Suizhong, Gaiping, Jianchang, and other places alone, small wineries have been established locally using wild plant raw materials, and four are already in production. These small wineries require little investment and yield significant results, with very simple equipment. For example, the service department invested 90 yuan and built a small winery in the Dongxing Second Cooperative of Suizhong County.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, January 24th: Nine small wineries using acorns, ginger lily, and other materials as substitutes are being built in the mountainous areas of Guizhou. Once these factories are put into production, they will produce 2.39 million jin of liquor annually. Acorns, ginger lily, and other materials are produced in large quantities in the mountainous areas of Guizhou. If fully utilized, preliminary calculations show that over 30,000 tons of liquor can be brewed throughout the year, which can save the country over 100 million jin of grain.

    辽宁贵州山区兴建小型酒厂
    据新华社沈阳24日电　辽宁省服务部门和供销社，积极利用山区野生植物和废弃果品做酿酒原料，计划今年利用这些代用原料生产白酒五千吨。完成这个计划，不仅可以给国家节省一万零六百多吨粮食，而且可以增加农民的副业收入。
    辽宁省内有三十三个市县是山区和半山区，生长着大量野生植物。据初步统计，能酿酒的代用原料就有三十九种，如橡子，山杏、玉竹、猪尾菜、山地瓜、山地豆以及各种残次废果。
    服务部门和供销社从去年第四季度以来，就大力帮助农业社利用野生植物开办小型酿酒厂。仅绥中、盖平、建昌等地，就利用野生植物原料就地建立了小型制酒厂，现已有四处投入生产。这些小型酒厂，投资少收效大，设备都十分简单。例如服务部门以九十元的投资，就在绥中县东兴二社建成了一座小型制酒厂。
    据新华社贵阳24日电　贵州山区正在兴建九个以橡子、老虎姜等作为代用原料的小型酒厂。这批厂投入生产以后每年能出酒二百三十九万斤。橡子、老虎姜等在贵州山区产量很大，如果充分利用起来，初步计算，全年可以酿酒三万吨以上，可以为国家节约粮食一亿多斤。
