Renmin University's Socialist Education Office, following the instructions of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding the establishment of socialist education courses, recently revised the teaching plan for the original socialist education courses. The Party Committee has approved this revised plan.

The teaching plan stipulates that the purpose and task of socialist education courses is to transform the old thinking of intellectuals and raise their socialist consciousness through systematic study of theory and policies, and free debate. Through study, students are required to distinguish between right and wrong on major issues on the ideological front between capitalism and socialism, thereby more consciously accepting socialism and striving for communism for the rest of their lives.

The plan also stipulates that socialist education courses are not only the most combative weapon for transforming thinking, but also a scientific and systematic political theory course. Therefore, this course must be fixed in all departments and disciplines in the future, and it must be taught and learned well.

The learning method should be to carefully study the designated key documents and skim through other reference books; on the basis of understanding the basic spirit of the documents, connect with reality and conduct full and free discussions to achieve the purpose of distinguishing between right and wrong and transforming thinking. To this end, students must study the documents from reality, and teachers must effectively grasp the students' ideological trends, conduct lectures and tutoring, and overcome the phenomenon of dogmatism in reciting articles, that is, they must implement the policy of "learning theory, connecting with reality, improving understanding, and transforming thinking." In the learning process, use the learned theory as a weapon to analyze and criticize their own bourgeois individualism and departmentalism, liberalism and anarchism, absolute egalitarianism, nationalism, and purely professional viewpoints, etc. In the teaching process, the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend should be implemented, and free debate should be fully launched. Disputes between students and between students and teachers are allowed, and reservations of different opinions are allowed, but it must be emphasized that the solution of ideological problems lies in personal determination and efforts, coupled with mutual assistance from everyone. Everyone is required to first be willing to express their thoughts, dare to put forward independent opinions, and strive to combine their own thoughts for analysis and criticism. Therefore, carrying out full and free debate should still become an important method for learning the socialist education course well.

    人民大学根据中宣部指示
    修改社会主义教育教学计划
    本报讯　中国人民大学社会主义教育办公室根据中共中央宣传部关于设立社会主义教育课程的指示，在最近，将原来的社会主义教育课程的教学计划作了重新修改，党委会已通过了这一修改后的计划。
    这个教学计划中规定，社会主义教育课程的目的和任务是，通过系统的理论、政策的学习和自由争辩，来改造知识分子的旧思想，提高社会主义觉悟。通过学习，要求学生能够分清资本主义同社会主义在思想战线上的大是大非问题，从而更加自觉地接受社会主义，终身为共产主义而奋斗。
    这个计划中还规定了社会主义教育课程既是改造思想的最富有战斗性的武器，也是一门科学的、系统的政治理论课程，因此，这一课程必须在今后所有系、科中把它固定下来，而且一定要把它教好和学好。
    学习方法，应该是精读指定的重点文件，粗读其他参考书；在领会文件基本精神的基础上，联系实际，进行充分和自由地讨论，达到明辨是非、改造思想的目的。为此，学生必须从实际出发去学习文件，教师必须切实掌握学生的思想动态，进行讲授和辅导，克服背诵条文的教条主义现象，也就是必须贯彻“学习理论、联系实际、提高认识、改造思想”的方针。在学习过程中，以所学到的理论作为武器分析和批判自己的资产阶级个人主义和本位主义、自由主义和无政府主义、绝对平均主义、民族主义以及单纯业务观点，等等。在教学过程中，要贯彻百家争鸣的方针，充分地展开自由辩论，同学间、同学和教师间，允许不同意见的争论和不同意见的保留，但必须强调思想问题的解决，在于个人的决心和努力，再加上大家的互相帮助。要求每个人首先肯于表达自己的思想，敢于提出独立的见解，力求结合自己的思想进行分析批判。所以开展充分地、自由地辩论，仍然应该成为学好社会主义教育一课的重要方法。
