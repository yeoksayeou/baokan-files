    Fifty Pieces of Cotton Yarn
    He Yiming, Worker at Xiangtan Cotton Textile Factory, Hunan
    The "speaking out" corner built with wooden planks was only up for three days, and it was already covered with big-character posters in red, green, and other colors. From morning till night, people were constantly coming and going.
    Factory Director He, with his full head of white hair and a pair of black-rimmed reading glasses, was reading and copying into his diary. Passing by the administrative management section, he was stopped by a burst of noise. He saw a young man with an angry face coming out of the door, shouting as he walked: "It's outrageous! They said they would supply according to the plan, and we had a plan last quarter, so why haven't they supplied it yet? They even said it was personally decided by the factory director. Fine! I'm going to reason with this bureaucratic factory director!"
    Factory Director He hurried up and asked, "Comrade, what's the matter that you're looking for the factory director?"
    The man shouted, "It's no use talking to you. I'll go find the bureaucrat tomorrow."
    Hearing this, Factory Director He remained calm and added, "Look at what you're saying, comrade. Aren't I also a member of this factory? Nowadays, everyone is a master of the factory. Why can't you tell me what's going on?"
    These words really worked. The man hurriedly turned around to size up Factory Director He, and then calmly replied, "Alright! I'll tell you. I'm a purchasing agent from the Duihe Knitting Factory. Last quarter, we signed a contract with your factory to buy fifty pieces of cotton yarn, with delivery scheduled for last month, but we still haven't received it."
    Factory Director He smiled and said, "In 1956, cotton production was reduced due to drought, and last month we couldn't run the machines at full capacity because we didn't have enough cotton. The factory also has difficulties!"
    Hearing this, the man frowned and shook his head, saying, "We're not buying your yarn to make other daily necessities this time. We've contracted for a batch of prizes for the construction teams. Look, people are working day and night, in all kinds of weather, sweating for the country selflessly. When it comes time to give out the prizes, what are we going to use? How can we face those advanced producers?"
    "Ah!" Factory Director He was a little surprised.
    "Alas! Your factory director and section chiefs are too bureaucratic. They don't know how to help me find a solution. Old comrade, please do me a favor! If you see your factory director, please tell him that I'm staying in Room 5 of the guesthouse and will come to find him tomorrow. Thank you!" With that, he walked away.
    Factory Director He watched the man walk away, then turned around and went into the administrative management section, asking the section chief about it. The section chief told him that every unit was pressing for goods and then said: "Factory Director, who isn't busy building socialism? He only knows that they are busy."
    Factory Director He felt troubled.
    "Ah! How about this?" Factory Director He suddenly said, "Isn't there still sixty pieces of yarn in the warehouse as revolving stock? Let's temporarily allocate them to them and replenish the warehouse at the end of the month."
    Early the next morning, the purchasing agent from the knitting factory was awakened by the sound of the motor in the auto repair shop across the street. He hurriedly got out of bed, washed his face, and planned to go find the factory director. As soon as he left the door, he saw many people in the auto repair shop across the street carrying pieces of cotton yarn onto a truck. He was furious, thinking: "This is being shipped out again, but we're not getting any." He hurried over to ask a mover, "Comrade, where are you taking this?"
    "To the Duihe Knitting Factory."
    He didn't believe it and turned around to ask someone else, when he saw the old man he had met in front of the administrative management section yesterday. The old man was directing the workers to load the cotton yarn onto the truck. He hurriedly ran forward. Factory Director He spoke first: "Comrade, this is all being shipped to your factory."
    Hearing this, he was so happy he wanted to jump up and down, shouting, "Old comrade, did you help me with this? When did you talk to the factory director? You're really good at mutual assistance and love! What's your surname? Your section chiefs and factory director are all bureaucratic. After I return to the factory, I will definitely write a letter through my unit to criticize them. They are too rigid in their work."

    五十件棉纱
    湖南湘潭棉纺厂工人　贺一鸣
    用木板搭的鸣放园地，刚搭起三天，上面就给红红绿绿的大字报贴满了，从早到晚，这里的人们总是络绎不绝。
    满头白发的何厂长，戴着一副黑边老花眼镜，一边看，还一边往日记本子上抄。路经行政管理科，他被一种喧闹声弄的停止了脚步，见门里走出一个满脸怒气的小伙子，边走边嚷：“真是岂有此理，还说按计划供应，我们上季度就有计划，为什么现在还不给供应呢？还说这是厂长亲自规定的，好吧！我就要找这个官僚主义的厂长说理去。”
    何厂长忙跑上去问道：“同志，你是什么事要去找厂长啊！”
    那人却嚷道：“跟你说没有用，我明天找官僚主义去。”
    何厂长听了，没动声色，又紧跟着加上了一句：“看你这同志说的，我不也是这厂里的一员，如今个个是厂里的主人，什么事你不能对我说？”
    这几句话真有效果，那汉子慌忙回头来把何厂长打量，然后才心平气和地答道：“好吧！我就告诉你吧，我是对河针织厂的采购员，上季度我们就和你们厂子订了个合同，买五十件棉纱，说定上月交货，可是现在还不给我们。”
    何厂长笑道：“1956年棉花因旱减了产，上月我们就因没棉花纺没开足车，厂里也有困难啊！”
    那人听着，眉头双锁，连忙摇头道：“我们买你们的纱，这回不是去做别的日常用品，是承包了一批建筑工程队的奖品，你看，人家日日夜夜、风风雨雨在为国家流汗，忘我劳动，等到要发奖品的那天，我们用什么去给呢？我们怎么对得住那些先进生产者呢？”
    “啊！”何厂长有些吃惊了。
    “唉！你们的厂长、科长真太官僚主义了，就不晓得帮我想个法子。老同志，你就帮我个忙吧！你如果遇着了你们的厂长，就帮我告诉他一声，说我住在招待所五号房间，明天来找他：麻烦你啊！”说着，就走开了。
    何厂长目送那人走远了，便折转身来，走进行政管理科，问了一下科长，科长便把每个单位逼着要货的事情告诉了他，接着说：“厂长呀，建设社会主义?，谁又不会忙呢？他就只知道他们忙。”
    何厂长感到为难了。
    “啊！这样吧！”何厂长忽然说：“仓库里不是还有六十件纱的周转纱，就暂时拨给他们，月底再补给仓库。”
    第二天清早，针织厂的采购员被对门汽车间的汽车马达声叫醒了，他慌忙爬起床来，洗了脸，打算找厂长去，刚出门，只见对门汽车间的一辆汽车上，许多人把一件件的棉纱往车上搬。他气极了，心想：“这又是运出去的，怎么就是没有我们的。”便忙跑过去问一个搬运工人：“同志，运到哪去呀？”
    “对河针织厂。”
    他不信，忙转过身去准备再问另一个人，谁知一眼就瞧见了昨天在行政管理科门前遇着的那位老头，那老头正在指挥工人们搬棉纱上车。他慌忙跑上前去，何厂长先开口了：“同志，这都是运到你们厂里去的。”
    他听了喜得要跳起来，嚷道：“老同志，这是你帮我办好的吧？你几时去跟厂长说的？你真会互助友爱，你贵姓啊？你们的科长、厂长都是官僚主义，我回厂后，一定通过单位写信来批评他们，他们做事太呆板了。”
