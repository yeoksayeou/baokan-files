Rushing to Repair Agricultural Machinery and Teach Repair Techniques
A Large Number of Technical Workers in Shanxi Go to the Countryside

    (Our newspaper Taiyuan, 26th) Nine hundred and eighty technical workers and technicians from fifty-one factories and mines in Shanxi Province have arrived in the countryside to repair agricultural power machinery. They were warmly welcomed by farmers everywhere.

    Dispatching workers and technicians to the countryside to repair agricultural power machinery is a decision made by the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee not long ago based on the demands of the farmers. In recent years, agricultural power machinery in Shanxi Province has developed rapidly. By the end of 1957, there were 3,931 sets of equipment such as locomotive boilers, gas engines, and diesel engines in the countryside. However, at present, some machines cannot be used because parts are damaged or lost; others have reduced efficiency due to severe wear and tear. In order to ensure a great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958, the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee decided to organize a large number of technical workers and technicians to go to the countryside for intensive repairs. The personnel drawn this time are all skilled workers with a certain technical level, such as fitters, machinists, electricians, and riveters, as well as engineering and technical personnel who can survey and draw drawings of power machinery parts. In addition, necessary administrative and political workers are equipped. When the repair personnel set off, they carried the tools needed for disassembling and assembling power machinery and general repairs. In order to reduce the mobility of personnel, the method of dividing counties and regions and contracting responsibilities was adopted.

    After this repair army went to the countryside, it powerfully encouraged the confidence of the broad masses of farmers in striving for a great leap forward in agriculture. After the repair team composed of four units including Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory arrived in Jieyu County on the 17th, the county-level leading organs held a tea party. Zhang Xintian, Secretary of the Jieyu County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, introduced the situation. In his speech, he said: "Your dispatch by the province has strengthened our confidence in the great leap forward in agricultural production. Our Jieyu County has decided to realize the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule this year: the county's per-mu yield of ginned cotton is 100 jin, and the per-mu yield of grain is 400 jin. To realize this grand plan, it is very important to give full play to the efficiency of power machinery to do a good job in water conservancy. However, although we have 1,051 sets of power machinery in the county, 307 sets were damaged during the drought last year. In the past, we were always worried that there was no way to repair these damaged machines. Now that you are here, we don’t have to worry anymore!" The captain of the power machinery repair team and more than a dozen other team members also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously stated: They will never go back without repairing these damaged machines! They also expressed that they would sow the seeds of technology wherever they went—establish a teacher-student relationship with the drivers and maintenance personnel of the agricultural cooperatives, and teach them their skills. On the morning of the 19th, they had already arrived in various villages. On this day, members of the agricultural cooperatives drove carts and happily went to welcome the honored guests—their worker elder brothers.

    Farmers everywhere are happy to call the sending of workers and technicians to the countryside to repair machines for them a new form of worker-peasant alliance. In previous years, Shanxi Province always held a large-scale worker-peasant get-together during the Spring Festival. However, in the past, most of them organized visiting groups to visit each other. This year, when farmers urgently need to repair agricultural machinery and strive for a great leap forward in agriculture, the workers came to their door to repair power machinery for them, and they love their worker elder brothers even more from the bottom of their hearts. Everyone believes that through the actual actions of workers supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production, the worker-peasant alliance will be more consolidated.

    赶修农业机械　传授修配技术
    山西大批技术工人下乡
    本报太原26日电　山西省五十一个厂矿企业派往农村突击修配农业动力机械的九百八十名技术工人和技术人员已经到达农村。他们受到了各地农民的热烈欢迎。
    派工人和技术人员下乡突击修配农业动力机械，是山西省人民委员会不久以前根据农民的要求作出的决定。几年来，山西省农业动力机械发展很快，到1957年底，农村已有锅驼机、煤气机、柴油机等设备三千九百三十一部。但是，目前有一部分机械因为零件损坏丢失已经不能使用；有的因机件磨损严重降低了效能。为了保证1958年农业生产大跃进，山西省人民委员会决定组织大批技术工人和技术人员下乡进行突击修配。这次抽调的人员，都是具有一定技术水平的钳工、机工、电工、铆工等技术工人和能测绘动力机械零件图纸的工程技术人员，另外配备了必要的行政和政治工作人员。修配人员出发的时候都携带了进行动力机械拆装和一般修配所需要的工具。为了减少人员的流动性，采取了分县分片、包干负责的办法。
    这支修配大军下乡以后，有力地鼓舞了广大农民争取农业大跃进的信心。太原重型机器厂等四个单位组成的修配大队在17日到达解虞县以后，县级领导机关举行了茶话会，由中共解虞县委书记张新田同志介绍情况。他在讲话中说：“省里派你们来，使我们对农业生产大跃进的信心更加坚定了。我们解虞县已经决定提前在今年实现全国农业发展纲要的要求：全县亩产皮棉一百斤，亩产粮食四百斤。要实现这个宏伟的计划，充分发挥动力机械的效能来搞好水利是非常重要的一环。可是，我们全县虽然有一千零五十一部动力机械，在去年抗旱期间却损坏了三百零七部。以前，我们老发愁这些损坏了的机器没有办法修理，现在你们来了，就不用发愁了。”动力机械修配队的队长和其他十来个队员也在会上讲了话。他们一致表示：不修好这些损坏了的机器，绝不回去！他们还表示要在所到之处都撒下技术的种子——同农业社的司机、维护人员建立师徒关系，把自己的技术教给他们。19日清晨，他们已经分别到达各个乡村。这天，农业社的社员们都赶着大车，兴高采烈地去迎接贵宾——他们的工人老大哥。
    各地农民都高兴地把工人和技术人员下乡为他们修配机器，叫做工农联盟的新形式。往年春节，山西省总要举行一次规模很大的工农联欢。但是，过去多半是组织参观团互相参观。今年，当农民正需要修理农业机械，争取农业大跃进的时候，工人们找上门来，为他们修配动力机械，他们从心里更加热爱工人老大哥。大家都相信：通过工人支援农业生产大跃进的实际行动，将使工农联盟更加巩固。
