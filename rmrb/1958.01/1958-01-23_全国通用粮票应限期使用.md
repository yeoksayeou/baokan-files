    National General Grain Coupons Should Have a Time Limit

    The state has taken a series of important measures on the grain issue, eliminating many wasteful and speculative behaviors. However, there is still a major loophole, such as the indefinite use of national general grain coupons.

    Many general grain coupons were printed in 1955, but are still in use today. Because it has the advantage of being "indefinite," many farmers use their provincial, time-limited grain coupons to exchange for national general grain coupons for storage. Some farmers or small-town residents exchange for these grain coupons and then flow into large cities for long periods without returning. For example, in Duxi Agricultural Cooperative, Baiqiao Township, He County, Anhui Province, there are forty to fifty people who live in cities relying on national general grain coupons without transferring their household registration. They say that having national general grain coupons is like having two "flying legs." Among them, a landlord, Lu Daode, who had just been released from prison, and his son, Lu Yijin, have been away from home for one or two years without participating in production (they have recently been found and returned). This not only makes it difficult for the state to grasp the numbers of these grain coupons, but also affects production and social order.

    Now, rumors are circulating among the masses that national general grain coupons printed before 1958 will be invalidated. As a result, many people are rushing to grain stores to buy rice.

    In order to correct this deviation, I suggest that national general grain coupons should have a time limit, such as one season or one year. This will not only prevent waste and speculation of grain, but also make it easier for the state to manage grain work.

### 全国通用粮票应限期使用

    全国通用粮票应限期使用
    国家对粮食问题采取了一系列的重要措施，杜绝了许多浪费和投机倒把的行为。但是，也还有一个很大的漏洞，如全国通用粮票无限期的使用。
    许多通用粮票还是1955年印发的，可是一直到现在还在用。因为它有“无限期”这个优越性，所以，许多农民用本省的限期有效的粮票换取全国通用粮票贮存起来。也有的农民或小城镇居民换了这种粮票以后，就流入大城市长期不回来。如安徽省和县白桥乡渡西农业社没有迁移户口而靠全国通用粮票在城市居住的，就有四、五十人。他们说有了全国通用粮票，就等于长了两条“飞毛腿”。其中有个刚刑满释放的地主鲁道德和他的儿子鲁义金一两年外出不来家生产（最近已找回来了）。这样一来，不仅使国家难于掌握这些粮票的数字，而且还影响了生产和社会治安。
    现在群众中谣传：1958年前印发的全国通用粮票要作废了。于是许多人纷纷到粮食店去买米。
    为了纠正这种偏向，我建议全国通用粮票应当是限期有效的，如一季、一年等。这样，一方面可以防止粮食的浪费和投机行为；另一方面国家对粮食工作也好掌握。
