    Even with Corruption, We Must Fight Corruption
    Some Enterprises and Government Offices in Jiangsu Expose Acts of Corruption

    (Our newspaper, Nanjing) During the current anti-waste campaign, state-owned enterprises and government offices in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Xuzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places have simultaneously exposed a number of acts of corruption and theft.

    According to investigations by state supervisory organs in more than 200 units, from January to October 1957, 1,674 corrupt and thieving elements have been discovered, with embezzled and stolen funds amounting to 150,000 yuan (incomplete statistics). According to statistics from the Nanjing Municipal Supervision Bureau, among 428 corrupt elements, 246 had joined the workforce after 1956, and among the 15 individuals who embezzled, stole, or misappropriated more than 500 yuan in public funds, eight were from the private sector. The general methods of corruption mainly involved altering documents and accounting books, making false reports and claims, inflating prices, and shortchanging. For example, Li Shaofa of the Xin Hai Lian Petroleum Company defrauded customers by overcharging them and embezzled 640 catties of petroleum. Wang Jiaqi, a salesman at the Nanjing Electrical Appliance Company, took advantage of the opportunity when the Nanjing Machinery Factory used cash to purchase silicon steel sheets. He intentionally changed the supply price to the wholesale price and colluded with relatives to falsely claim the difference when refunding the overcharged amount, tearing up the original stub in the process. In one instance, he embezzled 386 yuan. The embezzled funds of these corrupt elements were mostly used for extravagant personal spending, indulging in excessive eating and drinking.

    有贪污也要反贪污
    江苏一些企业机关揭发贪污行为
    本报南京讯　南京、镇江、徐州、苏州、无锡等地国家企业机关在这次反浪费运动中，同时揭发了一批贪污盗窃的行为。
    根据国家监察机关在二百多个单位的检查，从1957年1月到10月，已发现贪污盗窃分子一千六百七十四人，贪污盗窃款项竟达十五万元（不完全的统计）。南京市监察局统计，四百二十八个贪污分子中，1956年以后参加工作的就有二百四十六人，贪污、盗窃和挪用公款在五百元以上的十五人中，就有八人是私方人员。一般的贪污方法主要是采取涂改单据、账册、虚报冒领、提高价格、克扣斤两等手段。如新海连石油公司李少发，用多收款的办法欺骗顾主，从中贪污石油六百四十斤。南京市交电公司营业员王家琪乘南京机械厂用现金购买矽钢片的机会，有意将供应价改为批发价，在退回多收的差价时，勾结亲戚冒领，并撕毁了正本存根，一次就贪污了三百八十六元。这些贪污分子的赃款，大多用于个人生活的挥霍，大吃大喝。
