Everybody Cares About Cadres Sent to Lower Levels

    Two Kinds of Mothers, Two Kinds of Love
    Zhang Zhong
    Every mother has children, and every mother loves her children—this is human nature. However, love differs; there is genuine love, and there is what appears to be love but is not. What is true love, and what is not, is clearly contrasted in the process of cadres being sent to lower levels.
    One kind of mother is happy and actively encouraging when she hears that her children are being sent to lower levels. Sun Xiaxian's mother, a cadre of the Personnel Department of the Shanghai Municipal Transportation Bureau, was very happy when she heard that her daughter was going to the countryside to participate in labor, and hurriedly sewed a cotton quilt for her. Fan Qin, the mother of Hu Ling, a cadre of the Shanghai Municipal Higher Education Bureau, wrote to the Higher Education Bureau when she heard that her daughter had requested to be sent to lower levels, sincerely requesting the director of the Higher Education Bureau to approve her daughter's request. Although two of Fan Qin's three children were no longer by her side, she still hoped that she would not be given any special consideration because of this.
    Another kind of mother is unhappy and makes a fuss when she hears that her children are going to be sent to lower levels. There was a mother of a staff member of the Ministry of Railways who went to the Ministry of Railways crying and begging for her son, but there were no real difficulties. In other places, there are also a few mothers who emphasize that their children have never done farm work and are afraid that they will not be able to bear it after being sent to lower levels, or that their children have never been far from home since they were young and are afraid that they will suffer after being sent to lower levels, and so on. In short, they are unwilling to send their children to lower levels.
    It should be said that the behavior of these two kinds of mothers stems from love for their children, but the expressions are very different. Why is there such a big difference?
    The former kind of mother truly loves her children. Fan Qin said in her letter: "…to enable Hu Ling, who comes from a petty-bourgeois background, to be thoroughly transformed through labor training." Although the letter does not explicitly state the purpose of training and transformation, the mother's intention is very clear, that is, she hopes that her daughter will grow up in hard struggle and become a revolutionary worker with a firm stand who can better serve the people. Wishing their children to become truly useful people to the people is a common characteristic of all mothers with broad minds.
    The latter kind of mother does not have proper love for her children, but is close to spoiling them. They treat their children as flowers in a greenhouse, unable to withstand the wind or the rain. They hope that their children will always stay by their side, always worry about their children's warmth, and always think about and arrange for their children. On the surface, they seem to care more about their children than the former kind of mother, but in reality, they only care more about the trivial matters of their children's lives. As for their children's future, and how to make their children more useful to the people, they do not care. They even consider their children's comfort more and consider what their children can get from society, without seriously considering what their children should give more to the people. They think that they are protecting their children in every way, but they have not fulfilled their responsibility as a mother at the most important juncture.
    Mother, this is a great and solemn title. It is also human nature for mothers to love their children. However, how to love and how to be a good mother worthy of our times is something that every mother should think deeply about.

### 两种母亲　两种爱护

    两种母亲　两种爱护
    张重
    每一个母亲都有子女，每一个母亲都爱自己的子女——这是人之常情。但是，爱与爱不同；有真正的爱，也有看来是爱其实非爱的爱。甚么是真爱，甚么不是真爱，这在干部下放过程中有明显的对比。
    一种母亲，听说子女下放，就欢欢喜喜，积极鼓励。上海市交通运输局人事处干部孙霞仙的母亲，听说女儿要下放农村，去参加劳动，很是高兴，赶忙为她缝制棉被。上海市高教局干部胡玲的母亲范勤，听说女儿提出下放要求，就给高教局写信，信中诚恳地请求高教局局长批准她的女儿的要求。虽然范勤的三个儿女有两个已经不在身边，但她仍然希望不要因此对她有所照顾。
    另一种母亲是，听说儿女要下放了，就很不高兴，吵吵闹闹。铁道部就有一个工作人员的母亲，曾经到铁道部哭哭啼啼，为儿子“说情”，但又不是有甚么真正困难。在其他地方，也还有少数母亲强调自己的儿女没有干过庄稼活，怕下放以后受不了，或是说儿女从小没出过远门，怕下放以后吃苦，等等。总之是不愿意儿女下放。
    应当说，这两种母亲的行为都是从爱儿女出发的，但表现出来的却迥然不同。为甚么有这样大的区别呢？
    前一种母亲，是真正爱儿女的。范勤在信里说：“………使小资产阶级出身的胡玲，在劳动锻炼中得到彻底的改造”。信中虽然还没有明确指出锻炼、改造的目的是甚么，但作母亲的心意已经看得很清楚，那就是希望女儿从艰苦斗争中成长起来，成为一个立场坚定的更好地为人民服务的革命工作人员。愿儿女成为一个真正对人民有用的人，这是一切具有广阔胸怀的母亲的共同特性。
    后一种母亲，对儿女不是正当的爱，近乎溺爱。她们把儿女当成温室里的花朵，不能经风，不能着雨。她们希望儿女永远守在膝下，时时担心儿女的寒暖，处处为儿女着想，为儿女安排。表面看来，她们较之前一种母亲对儿女有更多的关怀，但在实际上，只是较多地关怀了儿女的生活琐事，至于儿女的前途，怎样才能使儿女成为对人民更有用的人，她们是不关心的。甚至说，她们较多地考虑了儿女的安逸，考虑儿女从社会上得到些甚么，而没有认真考虑自己的儿女要更多地给人民些甚么。她们以为处处爱护儿女，却恰恰在最重要关头上没有尽到母亲的责任。
    母亲，这是伟大庄严的称号。母亲爱子女，这也是人情之常。但是，怎样去爱，怎样做一个不愧于我们时代的好母亲，这却是每一个做母亲的都要深思的。
