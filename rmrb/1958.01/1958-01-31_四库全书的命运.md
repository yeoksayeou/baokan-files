    Editor's Note: After the publication of "How Big is the Siku Quanshu?" on this page on January 10, we received letters from readers asking about the preservation and loss of the Siku Quanshu. Here is a reply from the original author:
    At the end of the 18th century, the Qing government collected books from all over the country, and gathered many scholars headed by Ji Yun to compile the Siku Quanshu. This "complete collection" was copied into seven original copies, which were stored in the Wen Yuan Pavilion of the Qing Palace, the Wen Yuan Pavilion of the Yuanmingyuan, the Wen Jin Pavilion of the Rehe Imperial Palace (Summer Resort), the Wen Su Pavilion of Shenyang, the Wen Zong Pavilion of Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang, the Wen Hui Pavilion of Daguantang in Yangzhou, and the Wen Lan Pavilion of Shengyin Temple in Hangzhou. In addition, there was a duplicate copy (master copy) stored in the Hanlin Academy (the location of the Siku Quanshu Hall). In 1773 (the second year of the compilation), Emperor Qianlong was already sixty-three years old, and he was deeply afraid that he would not see the completion of the Siku Quanshu. Therefore, he ordered the Siku Quanshu Hall to first select important books from the Siku Quanshu and copy them into two copies of "Siku Quanshu Huiyao," which were stored in the Chi Zao Hall of the Qing Palace and the Wei Yu Study of the Yuanmingyuan.
    The preservation and loss of these books are as follows:
    The Siku Quanshu in the Wen Yuan Pavilion was the first original copy of the Siku Quanshu, which was completed in 1781 and stored in the following year. In 1933, the Kuomintang government transported it to Shanghai together with the "Siku Quanshu Huiyao" from the Chi Zao Hall of the Forbidden City, along with other rare books, a total of 30 copies, which were photo-printed by the Commercial Press and prepared to be presented to libraries of various countries. A total of 231 types, 1,960 volumes, were printed, named "First Collection of Rare Books of the Siku Quanshu," and completed in 1935. This was the first printing of the Siku Quanshu. Afterwards, this Siku Quanshu was moved from Shanghai to Yipinchang near Chongqing. On the eve of liberation, it was looted to Taiwan by the Kuomintang reactionary government.
    The Siku Quanshu in the Wen Su Pavilion was the second original copy completed in 1782. It was transported to Beijing in 1914, and then transported back to Shenyang in 1925. During the "September 18th" Incident in 1931, it was plundered by the Japanese invaders. After Japan surrendered, it was received by the Soviet Union and returned to our country. It is now treasured in Shenyang.
    The Siku Quanshu in the Wen Yuan Pavilion was the third original copy completed in 1783. In September 1860 (the 10th year of Xianfeng), the Anglo-French Allied Forces who entered Beijing looted and burned down the Yuanmingyuan. Most of this book and the "Huiyao" of the Wei Yu Study were destroyed in the fire along with the buildings. A small part was "auctioned" by robbers and flowed into the private sector.
    The Siku Quanshu in the Wen Jin Pavilion was the fourth original copy completed in 1784 and stored in the following year. It was transported to Beijing in 1925 and is now treasured in the Beijing Library. Wenjin Street in the capital city gets its name from this.
    The Siku Quanshu in the Wen Zong Pavilion was one of the three original copies completed in 1787. It was damaged by the British army in the Opium War in 1841 (the 21st year of Daoguang). In 1853, the Taiping Army liberated Zhenjiang. In the chaos, the pavilion and the books were completely burned down.
    The Siku Quanshu in the Wen Hui Pavilion was another one of the three original copies completed in 1787. It was completely destroyed in the chaos when the Taiping Army liberated Yangzhou in 1854.
    The Siku Quanshu in the Wen Lan Pavilion was also one of the three original copies completed in 1787. It was lost when the Taiping Army liberated Hangzhou for the second time in 1860. Later, local book collectors Ding Shen and Ding Bing brothers collected 3,140 volumes. When the Wen Lan Pavilion was rebuilt in 1880, the Ding brothers returned the books they had collected, and then successively collected some and re-copied the missing parts. In 1925, this book was largely completed and preserved by the former Zhejiang Provincial Library. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, this book was moved to Qingmuguan, Chongqing. The current situation is unknown.
    The duplicate copy of the Hanlin Academy was already incomplete due to the looting by the Anglo-French Allied Forces in 1860. In 1900, the Eight-Power Allied Forces looted 47,506 volumes of this book (mostly duplicates), which were first placed in Tor, Italy, and later transferred to the British Universal Library.
    The Siku Quanshu Huiyao of the Chi Zao Hall was transported to Shanghai in 1933, then to Chongqing, and looted to Taiwan on the eve of liberation.
    The Siku Quanshu Huiyao of the Wei Yu Study was destroyed by the Anglo-French Allied Forces. (Xi)

    四库全书的命运
    编者按：1月10日，本版发表了“四库全书有多大？”以后，接到一些读者来信，询问四库全书保存和损失的情况，兹由原作者答复如下：
    十八世纪末期，清朝政府搜罗了全国各地书籍，聚集昀了以纪为首的许多学者纂修四库全书。这部“全书”共抄了正本七部，分别藏于清宫文渊阁，圆明园文源阁，热河行宫（避暑山庄）文津阁，沈阳文溯阁，镇江金山寺文宗阁，扬州大观堂文汇阁，杭州圣因寺文澜阁。此外，又有副本（底本）一部，藏翰林院（四库全书馆所在地）。1773年（开始纂修的第二年），乾隆皇帝已经六十三岁了，深恐自己看不到四库全书的完成，乃命令四库全书馆先选择四库全书中的重要书籍，抄成“四库全书荟要”二部，分藏于清宫摛藻堂和圆明园味腴书屋。
    这些书的保存和损失情况如下：
    文渊阁的四库全书，是1781年抄成、于次年藏入的第一部四库全书正本。1933年，国民党政府把它同故宫摛藻堂“四库全书荟要”一起运到上海，加上其他罕见的书，共三十部，由商务印书馆影印，准备分赠各国图书馆。共印了二百三十一种，一千九百六十册，定名“四库全书珍本初集”，1935年出齐。这是四库全书的第一次印刷。之后，这部四库全书又由上海迁到重庆附近的一品场，解放前夕，被国民党反动政府劫往台湾。
    文溯阁的四库全书，是1782年抄成的第二部正本，1914年运存北京，1925年又运回沈阳，1931年“九一八”事变中被日寇掠去，日本投降后由苏联接收，归还我国。现在还珍藏在沈阳。
    文源阁的四库全书，是1783年抄成的第三部正本。1860（咸丰10）年9月间，进入北京的英法联军抢掠并放火烧毁圆明园，这部书的大部分和味腴书屋的“荟要”连同建筑物同遭火劫，一小部分被强盗们“拍卖”而流入民间。
    文津阁的四库全书，是1784年抄成、次年藏入的第四部正本，1925年运存北京，现珍藏于北京图书馆。首都文津街便由是而得名。
    文宗阁的四库全书，是1787年抄成的三部正本中的一部，在1841（道光21）年鸦片战争中遭英军毁坏。1853年太平军解放镇江，混乱中阁和书被焚毁无遗。
    文汇阁的四库全书，是1787年抄成的三部正本中的又一部。1854年太平军解放扬州，在混乱中被全部毁坏。
    文澜阁的四库全书，也是1787年抄成的三部正本中的一部，在1860年太平军第二次解放杭州时散失了，后来由当地藏书家丁申、丁丙兄弟收集了三千一百四十册。到1880年重建文澜阁时，丁氏兄弟送还所收书籍，之后又陆续收集了一些和补抄了残缺部分。1925年，这部书大体上补齐了，由前浙江省立图书馆保存。抗日战争爆发后，这部书被迁移到重庆青木关。近况未详。
    翰林院的副本，在1860年就已被英法联军掠夺得残缺不全了。1900年，八国联军又抢去这部书的四万七千五百零六册（大部分是副本），先放在意大利的托尔，后来展转藏于英国万国藏书楼。
    摛藻堂的四库全书荟要，1933年运上海，后运重庆，解放前夕被劫往台湾。
    味腴书屋的四库全书荟要，毁于英法联军。　（熙）
