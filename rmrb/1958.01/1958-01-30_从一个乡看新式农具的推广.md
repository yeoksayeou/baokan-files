Looking at the Promotion of New-Style Farm Tools from a Township

Bapan Township is an ordinary township in Jiangkou County, Guizhou. The township consists of seven cooperatives, half mountainous valleys and half plains. During last year's autumn plowing, the township used 37 double-share plows and 47 other new-style plows to plow 63% of the small-season fields. The outstanding Da’ao cooperative among the seven cooperatives plowed 1,300 mu of land with new-style farm tools, accounting for more than 78% of the cooperative's farmland.

The history of using new-style farm tools in this township is not long. In 1955, the township only had two mountain plows and one 7-inch step plow. In the first half of 1956, eight double-share plows and 20 mountain plows were newly purchased. The township party secretary worked hard to organize a group of activists to learn how to use them, but the masses were not used to this big fellow (double-share plow) weighing 180 jin. During the major season production, it plowed less than 3% of the farmland area. Even so, after a period of trial use, the farm tool handlers began to like the new-style farm tools. Therefore, in the second half of 1956, the seven cooperatives in the township bought 22 more double-share plows (30 in total including the previous ones), eight single-share plows without wheels, and six mountain plows (28 in total including the previous ones). From this series of numbers, we only see the development of new-style farm tools in this township. But in the actual promotion process, the situation is much more complicated.

Starting with the "Five Fears"

When the promotion began, a more widespread opposition sentiment emerged among the masses. Huang Guangyou, the production team leader of Da'ao Cooperative, said: "The double-share plow is a torture for both people and cattle. I never want to see it in my life." When the youth technical team of Bapan Cooperative went to plow the fields with cattle, the feeder Guo Fengxiang only agreed to give them a blind cow. Li Zuqiao, a member of Xinjiang Cooperative, got angry when he saw the truck transporting new-style farm tools. When the young female farm tool handlers Huang Baolan and Huang Meihua started learning, they couldn't find cattle when they needed cattle, and they couldn't find ropes when they needed ropes. The masses also ridiculed them, saying: "Since ancient times, there have been no women plowing the fields! You'll never learn it!" In short, there was complaint, opposition, sarcasm, and blows, rather than welcome. The township party branch and the farm tool promotion station were not overwhelmed by this wave of opposition. They calmly analyzed the root causes of the opposition and believed that it was not that the new-style farm tools were not good; the masses opposed them because they did not understand the new-style farm tools and had concerns. At that time, they analyzed various objections and expressions and summarized that the masses had five fears. These five fears were: first, fear that the cattle could not pull it; second, fear that people could not lift it; third, fear that the investment was too large, which was not in line with the principle of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative; fourth, fear of earning fewer work points due to unfamiliarity with the technology; and fifth, fear that local blacksmiths could not repair it if it broke down. Although the root was found, the party branch spent a lot of effort to eliminate these five fears.

The Role of the Party Branch

The township party branch clarified its combat mission and strengthened its leadership over the promotion station, ensuring the promotion of new-style farm tools politically, organizationally, and technically. In this process from scratch and from less to more, the party branch grasped the following tasks:

First, criticize right-leaning conservative thinking from within the party to outside the party. When the promotion of new-style farm tools began, even the members of the party branch had inconsistent understandings of this issue. For example, the branch secretary Tang Shiqiao once used the excuse of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative and wanted to change the planned six double-share plows of Bapan Cooperative to four. Under the leadership of the district committee, the party branch once launched a debate on this matter and criticized right-leaning conservative thinking. In April 1956, the county committee raised this matter again at a production meeting for everyone to discuss. As a result, Comrade Tang Shiqiao completely changed his mind and, in cooperation with the comrades of the agricultural extension station, took active responsibility for the promotion of new-style farm tools in Da'ao Cooperative, which motivated the entire township. Wu Maodi, the director of Bapan Cooperative, originally had a quarrel with the supply and marketing cooperative cadres for promoting double-share plows. After the discussion, he realized his mistake and took the initiative to suggest that the cooperative adopt the method of winning red flags in the promotion of new-style farm tools, with evaluations every ten days, which played a powerful role in promotion. At every cadre meeting, cooperative director meeting, and member meeting held by each cooperative in the township, party members always adhered to the correct position of promoting new-style farm tools.

Second, cultivate the backbone for using new-style farm tools and convince the masses with facts. The township party branch and the farm tool promotion station deeply understood from their rural work over the years that facts are the most persuasive. Therefore, they attached particular importance to discovering and cultivating activists in using new-style farm tools among the masses. Over the past two years, they have cultivated Xiao Guisheng, a farm tool handler who can independently carry the plow head up high slopes to plow fine fields and plow 270 mu every year; they have cultivated female farm tool handlers Huang Baolan and Huang Meihua; and they have also cultivated Tian Shikui, a farm tool handler who carries the plow head and drives the cattle around to perform, using facts to educate the masses. There are 54 outstanding farm tool handlers like them in the entire township over the past two years. They are role models for the entire township and even for the entire county.

In addition to the 39 farm tool handlers who participated in the county's training, the township also adopted the method of three days of learning and one day of appraisal in the cooperatives, training 87 farm tool handlers. These farm tool handlers can all skillfully use new-style farm tools. For example, the model farm tool handler Xiao Guisheng can plow almost any field. During the small-season planting last year, he plowed a field on a slope 500 meters high. This field was 37 zhang long, only 7 chi wide at its widest point, and had seven bends. He successfully plowed this field, completely demonstrating the superiority of the double-share plow to the masses. In the promotion of technology, Bapan Township resolutely implemented the county committee's instructions, and township and cooperative cadres all took the lead in learning one after another, and all mastered the skills of using the technology.

Third, implement the method of fixing farmland, cattle, farm tools, and farm tool handlers, and reasonable division of labor, to ensure the promotion of new-style farm tools from the system. The township party branch considered certain obstacles to the use of new-style farm tools, such as fear of others stealing work points and fear of plowing the cattle badly, were caused by unsound systems. They established a system of "four fixings and one reasonableness." With this system, new-style farm tools in Bapan Township finally leaped from the experimental stage to formal universal use.

"Six Goods" Replace "Five Fears"

Over the past two years, new-style farm tools have opened up a new situation in Bapan Township. Especially during last year's autumn plowing, when there was a drought for 80 days and the farmland was hardened, the old plows could not plow, and the new-style farm tools showed their unparalleled superiority even more. Da'ao Cooperative used double-share plows to plant ten days earlier than in previous years. Tan Yunqing, the farm tool team leader, said with emotion: "This year's autumn drought made it impossible for the old plows to plow in. If it weren't for the double-share plows showing their strength, I'm afraid that two out of three shares of the cooperative's small-season area wouldn't have been planted." The production team leader Huang Guangyou affectionately called the double-share plow a "steel plate plow." Yang Damao and others, who originally opposed new-style farm tools, secretly took the double-share plows to use when the farm tool handlers were not at home. After plowing for five days, they also became farm tool handlers.

New-style farm tools in Bapan Township have truly achieved "high slopes and plains can be used, and men, women, old and young can plow." No more complaints or opposition can be heard. Now, as long as it is the plowing season, the fields and dams are full of relaxed and happy farm tool handlers tilling the land, just as the farmers in our county praise:

Two cattle pull the plow as fast as the wind,
The double-share turns the soil as quickly as a dragon;
Who says new-style farm tools are heavy?
Girls can lift them up without blushing.
At this time, the masses unanimously recognized that new-style farm tools have six goods:

First good: New-style farm tools can plow deep, especially the double-share plow, which plows deep and can store manure and increase production. For example, in Xinjiang Cooperative, two plots of land on a dam were used for a comparative experiment. Both were planted with triangular clusters. One plot with 38 luo (Note: a measurement unit commonly used by farmers in Guizhou) used a double-share plow, and the other plot with 48 luo used an old plow. The previous crop was wheat, the soil quality was the same, and the mid-tillage fertilization was the same. As a result, the plot using the double-share plow yielded 557 jin of grain per mu, and the plot using the old plow yielded 468.5 jin of grain per mu. The double-share plow increased production by 19.14% compared to the old plow. Last year, the entire county used double-share plows to plow 8,500 mu of major-season fields, which can increase grain production by 756,500 jin.

Second good: The bottom is plowed flat and can resist drought. The same field plowed with a double-share plow is more drought-resistant for five to seven days than plowed with an old plow.

Third good: It can save a lot of labor. Last year, Da'ao Cooperative plowed dry fields in autumn planting. One double-share plow and one mountain plow, with two people and three cattle, can plow five mu per day. The old plow can only plow one mu per day with one person and one ox. New farm tools save one and a half times the manpower compared to the plow and save more than 60% of the cattle labor. Last year, the entire county plowed 48,000 mu in two seasons, using only 8,000 workdays. Using old cattle would require 24,000 workdays, saving 16,000 workdays, and saving 8,000 cattle workdays.

Fourth good: It can resist drought and sow, without delaying the season. Da'ao Cooperative sowed in autumn drought last year, and the farmland was difficult to plow. Thanks to the use of new-style farm tools, it was planted ten days earlier than in previous years.

Fifth good: New-style farm tools are easy to operate and not laborious, especially the double-wheel double-share plow. As long as the operation is skilled and the cattle walk steadily, people are not tired. For example, Zhang Taoxian, a 16-year-old girl with a disabled left hand from Bapan Cooperative, used a double-share plow and was rated as a model in the cooperative; Wang Yisheng, who is over 60 years old, can also use new-style farm tools.

Sixth good: New-style farm tools are durable and save expenses, which is in line with the principle of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative. One double-share plow in Da'ao Cooperative only replaced two plow tips after plowing 270 mu. If we calculate using new-style farm tools to plow 1,200 mu, it would require replacing nine plow tips, worth 2.7 yuan. The plow fastener uses 20 jin of green hemp, worth 10 yuan, the oil for wiping the plow is 4.5 jin, worth 2.88 yuan, and the plow depreciation is 7 yuan. The total cost of new-style farm tools is 22.05 yuan. Each old plow tip can only plow 20 mu of land, requiring 60 pieces, worth 39 yuan, 30 workdays to install the plow, worth 13.5 yuan, and 10 pieces of wood, worth 10 yuan, for a total of 62.5 yuan. New-style farm tools save more than three times compared to old plows.

### 从一个乡看新式农具的推广

    从一个乡看新式农具的推广
    坝盘乡是贵州江口县一个平常的乡。全乡七个社，山沟平坝各半。在去年秋耕中，全乡用三十七架双铧犁和四十七架其他新式犁，犁了63％的小季田。七个社中突出的大坳社，新式农具犁田一千三百亩，占全社田土的78％以上。
    这个乡使用新式农具的历史并不长。1955年全乡才有二部山地犁和一架七寸步犁，1956年上半年新买双铧犁八部，山地犁二十部。乡党支书努力组织一批积极分子学习使用，但对这重达一百八十斤的大家伙（双铧犁），群众很不习惯，大季生产中犁田不到田土面积的3％。虽然如此，经过一段时间试用，农具手们都开始喜欢新式农具了。所以1956年下半年全乡七个社又买双铧犁二十二部（连前共三十部），无轮一铧犁八部，山地犁六部（连前共二十八部）。从上面这一连串数字，我们只看到这个乡新式农具的发展情况。但在实际的推广过程中，情况就要复杂得多。
    从“五怕”谈起
    开始推广的时候，群众中出现了较为普遍的反对情绪。大坳社的生产队长黄光友说：“双铧犁是磨人磨牛王，我一辈子也不愿见它”。坝盘社青年技术队去牵牛犁田时，饲养员郭凤祥只肯给一头瞎子牛；新江社社员李祖桥看到运新式农具的汽车就生气；大坳社女青年农具手黄保兰、黄梅花开始学习时，要牛找不到牛，要?索找不到?索，群众还讥笑她们说：“自古以来那有女的犁田呀！你们学会了才有鬼呢？”总之，是埋怨，是反对，是讽刺打击，而不是欢迎。乡党支部和农具推广站并没有为这一股反对浪潮冲倒。他们冷静地分析了反对的根源，认为这并不是新式农具不好；群众反对，是群众对新式农具不了解，产生了顾虑。当时他们把各种反对意见和表现，作了分析，总结出群众有五怕。这五怕是：一怕牛拉不动，二怕人抬不起，三怕投资过大，不合勤俭办社原则，四怕技术不熟少得工分，五怕用坏了本地铁匠修不起。根子虽找到了，党支部为解除这五怕思想也费了很大的劲。
    党支部的作用
    乡党支部明确了自己的战斗任务，加强了对推广站的领导，从政治上组织上技术上保证了新式农具的推广。在这从无到有，由少到多的过程中，党支部抓住了以下一些工作：
    首先，从党内到党外批判右倾保守思想。开始推广新式农具的时候，连党支部成员对这个问题的认识都是不一致的。如支部书记唐士桥就曾借口勤俭办社，想把坝盘社计划的六部双铧犁改为四部。在区委的领导下，党支部曾经专为此事展开过辩论，批判了右倾保守思想。1956年4月，县委在一次生产会议上，又把此事提出叫大家讨论。结果唐士桥同志彻底转变过来，并与农推站同志分工，积极负责大坳社的新式农具推广工作，把全乡都带动起来了。坝盘社主任吴毛弟原先为推广双铧犁与供销社干部闹架，经过讨论，认清了自己的错误之后，还主动的建议社里在推广新式农具中采取夺红旗的办法，十天评一次，起了有力的推动作用。全乡每次干部会、社主任会及各社召开的社员会上，党员都始终坚持了推广新式农具的正确立场。
    其次，培养使用新式农具骨干，用事实说服群众。乡党支部、农具推广站从历年的农村工作中都深深地了解事实是最能说服人的。因此，他们特别重视在群众中发现与培养使用新式农具积极分子。两年来他们在全乡培养了能独自扛犁头上高坡犁细田，每年犁二百七十亩的农具手萧贵生；培养了女农具手黄保兰、黄梅花；还培养了扛起犁头赶起牛到处表演，用事实教育群众的农具手田士魁。像他们这样出色的农具手，全乡两年来培养了五十四人。他们是全乡的甚至有的是全县的模范人物。
    全乡除了参加县里学习的三十九名农具手外，还在社里采取了三天学习一天鉴定的办法，训练了八十七名农具手。这些农具手都能熟练地使用新式农具。如模范农具手萧贵生几乎是任何田都能犁了。去年种小季中，他在五百公尺高的坡上犁一丘的田。这田有三十七丈长，最宽的地方才七尺，又有七个弯，他出色地犁了这丘田，向群众完全证实了双铧犁的优越性。在推广技术中，坝盘乡坚决贯彻了县委的指示，乡干部、社干部都先后带头学习，全都掌握了使用技术。
    第三、推行田土、耕牛、农具、农具手固定，分工合理的办法，从制度上保证了新式农具的推广。乡党支部考虑到使用新式农具的某些障碍，如怕别人抢工分，怕犁坏牛等，是制度不健全造成的。他们建立了“四固定一合理”的制度，有了这个制度，新式农具在坝盘乡，才最后由试验阶段跃进到正式的普遍的使用。
    “六好”代替“五怕”
    两年来新式农具已在坝盘乡打开了局面，尤其是去年秋耕中天旱八十来天，田土板结，老犁犁不动，新式农具更加显出了它的无比优越性。大坳社因使用了双铧犁比往年提前十天播种。农具队长谭云清很感动的说：“今年秋旱，老犁犁不进去，要不是得双铧犁展劲，全社小季面积，三股里面恐怕没种上两股”。生产队长黄光友亲热地称双铧犁为“钢板犁”。原来反对新式农具的杨大毛等，趁农具手不在家，也悄悄地拿双铧犁去用，犁了五天也成为农具手了。
    新式农具在坝盘真正做到了“高坡平坝都能用，男女老少都能犁”。再也听不到埋怨反对的声音了。现在，只要在犁田季节里，满田满坝都是轻松愉快的农具手们在翻田，正如我县农民所赞美的一样：
    两牛拉犁急如风，双铧翻土快如龙；
    谁说新式农具重？姑娘扶起脸不红。到了这个时候，群众一致公认新式农具有六好：
    第一好，新式农具能深耕，特别是双铧犁犁得深，窖粪行，能增产。如新江社在一个坝上以两丘田来作对比试验，都栽三角丛植，三十八箩（注：贵州农民习惯用的计量单位）的一丘用双铧犁，四十八箩的一丘用旧犁，前作都是小麦，土质相同，中耕施肥一样，结果用双铧犁的每亩产谷五百五十七斤，用旧犁的每亩产谷四百六十八斤半，双铧犁比旧犁增产19.14％，全县去年用双铧犁共犁大季田八千五百亩，即可增产粮食七十五万六千五百斤。
    第二好，底子犁得平，能抗旱，同样的田用双铧犁要比旧犁犁的耐旱五至七天。
    第三好，能大量节约劳动力。大坳社去年秋播犁旱田，一部双铧犁配一部山地犁，每天二人三牛能犁五亩，旧犁每天一人一牛只能犁一亩，新农具比犁头节约人力一倍半，节约牛工60％多。全县去年犁二季四万八千亩，只用八千个工；采用老牛，要二万四千个工，节省一万六千个人工，牛工还可节省八千个。
    第四好，能抗旱播种，不误季节。大坳社去年秋旱播种，田土不好犁，由于使用了新式农具，反比往年提前十天。
    第五好，新式农具好操作，不吃力，特别是双轮双铧犁，只要操作熟练，牛走稳了人不累。如坝盘社左手残废的十六岁的小女孩张桃仙使用双铧犁，评上社里的模范；六十多岁的王意胜也会使用新式农具。
    第六好，新式农具耐用，节省开支，符合勤俭办社原则。大坳社一架双铧犁犁了二百七十亩才换两个铧尖，如以用新式农具犁一千二百亩计算，要换九个铧尖，值二元七角，犁扣用青麻二十斤，十元，擦犁用油四斤半，二元八角八分，犁折旧七元，新式农具共用二十二元五。旧犁头每架铧口只能铧地二十亩，需六十件，三十九元，装犁三十个工十三元五角，用木料十根十元，共六十二元五角。新式农具较旧犁节约三倍多。
