Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Banquet Welcoming Crown Prince Badr
Your Royal Highness Crown Prince Muhammad al-Badr, distinguished guests from the Kingdom of Yemen, friends, comrades:

Today is New Year's Day, 1958. First of all, I would like to extend New Year's greetings to our distinguished guest, His Royal Highness Prince Saif al-Islam Muhammad al-Badr, Deputy Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Yemen, and the other distinguished Yemeni guests accompanying him, to the heads of diplomatic missions in China and their spouses, and to all friends and comrades present. At the end of the old year and the beginning of the new year, we are very pleased that His Royal Highness Prince Muhammad al-Badr has come to visit our country, symbolizing a new development in the traditional friendship between China and Yemen. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome to His Royal Highness Prince Muhammad al-Badr and, through His Royal Highness, pay high tribute to the people of Yemen.

The people of China and the people of Yemen have been interacting and forging friendships since very early times. It was only after the forces of Western colonialist countries invaded Asia and Africa that the friendly exchanges between our two countries were artificially hindered. However, our similar situations under colonialist oppression and our respective struggles for national independence have further deepened the mutual sympathy and concern between our two peoples. Representatives from both our countries attended the historic Bandung Conference, and the representatives of both countries made joint efforts for the success of this conference. In 1956, our two countries officially established diplomatic relations. Thus, thanks to the joint efforts of both countries, the traditional friendly relations between the two countries have not only been restored, but have also been further developed on a new basis.

Under the leadership of His Majesty King Imam Ahmad and His Royal Highness Prince Muhammad al-Badr, the people of Yemen have waged and are continuing to wage a heroic struggle to safeguard national independence, state sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and to oppose imperialist aggression. In its foreign relations, the Kingdom of Yemen pursues a policy of safeguarding the cause of international peace, not participating in aggressive military alliances, and promoting friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries, and, in accordance with the basic principles of the United Nations and the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, supports the rights of all peoples to freedom and independence. Yemen has strengthened its solidarity with Asian and African countries, especially with Arab countries, and stands together with Egypt, Syria, and other countries pursuing a policy of national independence, resolutely opposing the interference of Western colonial countries in the affairs of Arab countries. All of this has won the great admiration of the Chinese people. The Chinese government and the Chinese people support the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, support Yemen's position on the issue of Aden and the southern region of Yemen called the Protectorate, and fully sympathize with and resolutely support the just struggle waged by the Yemeni people. We are deeply convinced that, with the support of the people of Arab countries and all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and peoples in the world, the united people of Yemen will surely be able to shatter any aggression and divisive conspiracies of the Western colonialist countries.

China's consistent effort in international affairs is to promote and develop extensive political, economic, and cultural ties and cooperation with Asian, African, and all countries in the world, in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference. We believe that the visit of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and the accompanying distinguished guests to our country will further promote mutual understanding and the development of friendly relations between our two countries, and strengthen our economic and cultural cooperation. The Chinese people cherish the friendship of the Yemeni people and the people of Arab countries very much, and we will reciprocate friendship with friendship. May the friendly relations between China and Yemen and the Arab countries continue to develop.

I propose a toast:
    To the prosperity of the Kingdom of Yemen and the happiness of the Yemeni people!
    To the victory of the just struggle of the Yemeni people!
    To the friendship between the Chinese people and the Yemeni people and the people of Arab countries!
    To the solidarity of the Asian and African peoples and the victory of the Bandung spirit!
    To peace in Asia, Africa, and the world!
    To the health of His Majesty King Imam Ahmad of Yemen!
    To the health of His Royal Highness Prince Muhammad al-Badr!
Cheers!

    在欢迎巴德尔王太子宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下，也门王国的各位贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    今天是1958年的元旦。我首先要向我们的贵宾、也门王国副首相塞弗·伊斯兰·穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下和同来的其他各位也门贵宾，向各国驻华使节和他们的夫人，向在座的朋友们和同志们祝贺新年。在旧的一年结束和新的一年开始的时候，穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下前来我国访问，象征着中国和也门之间的传统友谊的新发展，使我们感到十分高兴。我现在代表中国政府和中国人民向穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下表示热烈的欢迎，并且通过殿下向也门全国人民表示崇高的敬意。
    中国人民和也门人民从很早的时候起就进行了往来和结成了友谊。只是在西方殖民主义国家的势力侵入亚非两洲以后，我们两国间的友好来往才遭到了人为的阻碍。但是，我们在殖民主义压迫下的相似处境和我们各自为争取和维护民族独立而进行的斗争，却更加加深了我们两国人民间的互相同情和关怀。我们两国的代表都出席了具有重大历史意义的万隆会议，两国代表为这一会议的成功做出了共同的努力。在1956年，我们两国正式建立了外交关系。这样，由于两国的共同努力，两国间传统的友好关系不仅已经恢复，而且在新的基础上得到了进一步的发展。
    也门人民在伊玛姆·艾哈迈德国王陛下和穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下的领导下，为了维护民族独立、国家主权和领土完整，反对帝国主义的侵略，曾经作过并且正在继续进行着英勇的斗争。也门王国在对外关系上执行维护国际和平事业、不参加侵略性军事联盟、和促进各国人民友好合作的政策，并且根据联合国的基本原则和万隆会议的决议，支持各国人民自由和独立的权利。也门加强了同亚非国家、首先是同阿拉伯各国的团结，并且同执行民族独立政策的埃及、叙利亚等国站在一起，坚决反对西方殖民国家对阿拉伯各国事务的干涉。所有这些，都赢得了中国人民的极大钦佩。中国政府和中国人民拥护万隆会议的决议，支持也门在亚丁和被称为保护国的也门南部地区问题上的立场，并且完全同情和坚决支持也门人民所进行的正义斗争。我们深信，在阿拉伯各国人民和全世界爱好和平和主张正义的国家和人民的支持下，团结一致的也门人民一定能够粉碎西方殖民主义国家的任何侵略和分裂的阴谋。
    中国在国际事务中一贯努力的方向，就是根据和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议的精神，促进和发展同亚非和世界一切国家在政治、经济、文化各方面的广泛联系和合作。我们相信，王太子殿下和陪同前来的各位贵宾到我国访问，一定会更进一步促进我们两国间相互的了解和友好关系的发展，并且加强我们两国在经济和文化方面的合作。中国人民十分珍惜也门人民和阿拉伯各国人民的友谊，我们将以友谊回答友谊。愿中国同也门和各阿拉伯国家的友好关系不断发展。
    我建议，为也门王国的繁荣和也门人民的幸福，
    为也门人民正义斗争的胜利，
    为中国人民同也门人民和阿拉伯各国人民的友谊，
    为亚非人民的团结和万隆精神的胜利，
    为亚非和世界的和平，
    为也门国王伊玛姆·艾哈迈德陛下的健康，
    为穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下的健康，
    干杯！
