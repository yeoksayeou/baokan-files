　　Xinhua News Agency report: The enormous impact of the Indonesian people's struggle against Dutch colonialism is becoming increasingly apparent within the Netherlands. The severing of economic ties with Indonesia, caused by the Dutch government's adherence to colonialist policies, is leading to a worsening economic situation in the Netherlands.

　　The return of Dutch nationals from Indonesia is creating extremely serious difficulties for the Netherlands. First, unemployment is increasing, while the housing shortage is becoming more acute.

　　The General Manager of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Mr. Aler, admitted in a statement that the disruption of shipping with Indonesia has cost his company millions of guilders. He indicated that KLM intends to scale back its operations and lay off some of its flight and service personnel.

　　Many people in Dutch political, business, and social circles are aware that a further deterioration in relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia will inevitably lead to a further deterioration in the Dutch economic situation. They are calling for a resumption of negotiations with Indonesia on the West Irian issue.

　　The Deputy Chairman of the Dutch Labour Party, Mr. Wous, advocated that the Dutch government immediately transfer sovereignty over West Irian to Indonesia.

　　On the 14th, the Dutch-Indonesian Association in the Netherlands issued a statement calling on the Dutch authorities to abandon their rule over West Irian and to proactively engage in negotiations with Indonesia to normalize relations between the two countries.

    印度尼西亚反荷斗争显出威力
    荷兰各界要求谈判压力增大
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：印度尼西亚反对荷兰殖民主义的斗争的巨大影响正在日益明显地在荷兰国内显现出来。由于荷兰政府坚持殖民主义政策而引起的同印度尼西亚的经济联系的断绝，使荷兰经济情况日益恶化。
    从印度尼西亚回国的荷兰人给荷兰带来极为严重的困难。首先是失业人数正在增加，同时房荒现象变得更为严重。
    荷兰皇家航空公司总经理阿莱尔在谈话中承认，同印度尼西亚航运的中断使他的公司损失了数百万盾。他表示，荷兰皇家航空公司打算缩减自己的营业，并且解雇一部分飞行人员和服务人员。
    荷兰政界、商界和社会各界的许多人士都意识到，荷兰和印度尼西亚的关系的进一步恶化必将导致荷兰经济情况的更加恶化。他们要求同印度尼西亚就西伊里安问题恢复谈判。
    荷兰劳工党副主席吴斯主张荷兰政府立刻把西伊里安的主权移交给印度尼西亚。
    在荷兰的荷兰—印度尼西亚协会14日发表声明，呼吁荷兰当局放弃对西伊里安的统治，并且主动地同印度尼西亚进行谈判，使两国之间的关系正常化。
