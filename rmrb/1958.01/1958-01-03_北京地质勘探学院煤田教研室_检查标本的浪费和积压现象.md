Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration, Coalfield Teaching and Research Office:
    Inspect Waste and Backlog of Specimens
    (Our Newspaper) The Coalfield Teaching and Research Office of the Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration recently inspected the laboratory specimens and found a total of 179 boxes of wasted and backlogged specimens.
    Many specimens collected by students during production internships have been backlogged in the warehouse until now, totaling 57 boxes. Serious cases include five boxes of coal samples, nineteen jars of grooved coal samples, and five sets of core specimens collected by students during their internship in Shiguaizi in 1955; eighteen bottles of water samples brought back by students during their internship in Zhuozishan; and specimens collected by students who interned in Southwest China, Guangxi, Taiyuan and other places in 1956. Now the students have long graduated and left the school, but the specimens are still sealed and backlogged in the warehouse. As for the specimens that were discarded because they had no labels or geological significance, they are not in the minority.
    There are a total of 51 large boxes collected by the Teaching and Research Office through dedicated personnel. For example, for the Hunyuan coal samples in Shanxi, the Teaching and Research Office had already collected them once in 1954 (about six boxes), which could generally meet the needs of teaching. However, in early 1956, the Teaching and Research Office sent teachers to the area again to collect specimens, resulting in a sudden increase of six to seven times more than the teaching needs, which had to be backlogged in the warehouse for a long time.
    There are also specimens sent by production departments that have been backlogged. For example, in 1954, when the teaching and research offices were first established, they asked the Fushun Mining Bureau for specimens of oil shale and coal, resulting in a total of more than 30 boxes being sent, of which 29 boxes are still backlogged.
    Due to the long-term backlog of specimens, a large number of specimens have been scrapped, thus wasting a large amount of state funds.
    At present, this Teaching and Research Office is actively dealing with the waste and backlog of specimens.

    检查标本的浪费和积压现象
    本报讯　北京地质勘探学院煤田教研室，最近检查了实验室标本的情况，发现共浪费和积压标本一百七十九箱。
    学生生产实习时所采集的许多标本，直到现在，仓库内还积压五十七箱。严重的如1955年在石拐子实习同学采回煤样五箱，刻槽煤样十九罐，岩心标本五套；卓资山实习同学带回水样十八瓶，1956年到西南、广西、太原等地实习同学所采集的标本。现在同学早已毕业离校，但标本仍原封不动的积压在仓库内。至于没有标签或没有地质意义而废掉的标本尚不在少数。
    由教研室专人出外采集的共有五十一大箱。比如山西浑源煤样，1954年教研室已采集过一次（约六箱），大致已能满足教学上的需要。但1956年初教研室再度派教师到该地区专门采集，结果一下子采回超过教学需要的六、七倍，以致不得不长期积压在仓库内。
    也有生产部门寄来的标本积压下来。如1954年各教研室刚成立时，曾向抚顺矿务局要油页岩和煤的标本，结果一共寄来三十余箱，直到现在还积压了二十九箱。
    由于标本的长期积压，以致大量标本报废，因而浪费了国家大量资金。
    目前这个教研室正在积极处理标本的浪费和积压问题。
