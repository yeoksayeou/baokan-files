    High-Altitude Cableway Soil Transportation Method

    Last year, Youfang Township in Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, invested in building a reservoir capable of irrigating more than 10,000 mu of land. The people building the reservoir tapped potential and found shortcuts, using the labor-saving and highly efficient high-altitude cableway soil transportation method. Using this method to transport soil requires only two people and can transport thirty-three cubic meters of soil per day, which is equivalent to the work of twenty-two strong laborers in one day.

    高空滑线运土法
    湖北襄阳县油坊乡去年自己投资兴修一个能灌溉一万多亩地的水库。兴修水库的人们，挖潜力、找窍门，运用既省力、效率又高的高空滑线运土法。用这种方法运土，只要两个人负责，一天可运土三十三立方；顶二十二个强劳动力一天的工作。
