    Even with More Money, We Can't Waste Like This
    Last year, during the conversion of dry land to paddy fields, the Damukou Agricultural Cooperative in Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province, spent more than four thousand yuan to purchase ten waterwheels. The rice grew very well that year, and they achieved a bumper harvest for the first time. However, after the autumn harvest, the waterwheels were no longer needed, and the production teams did not properly store and maintain them. They were placed next to various ditches. Some were even used as bridges or as scaffolding for building houses. The cooperative cadres were busy going to market and drinking, and some were busy building assembly halls to prepare for performances. They saw the situation but didn't care. Now, not only are many parts of these waterwheels missing, but the main frames have also been weathered by wind, rain, and sun, and trampled by people and animals, making them look terrible. Many cooperative members have long suggested that they be stored and maintained, but the cadres not only ignore them but also say, "We've had a bumper harvest, and we have plenty of money. It doesn't matter if something is damaged; we'll buy new and better ones later." The cooperative members are very angry about this. It is the responsibility of every cooperative member to cherish the cooperative's public property, but the cadres of this cooperative are so extravagant and wasteful. Therefore, we hope that relevant departments will investigate and eliminate this bad work style.

    钱再多也不能这样浪费
    江苏省灌云县大穆口农业社，在去年旱改水时，花了四千多元购置了十部水车。这年水稻长得很好，第一次就获得大丰收。可是在秋收后，水车用不着了，各生产队没有好好地把它收藏保管起来，放在各个沟渠旁边。有的甚至用来搭桥，做盖房子的脚手。社干部只忙着赶集喝酒，有的忙着盖大会堂准备演戏，看见了也不过问。现在这些水车，零件不但损失了不少，而且主要的杆架已被风吹、雨打、日晒和人畜踩踏，糟蹋得不像样子了。许多社员早就建议把它收藏保管起来，可是干部们不但不闻不问，反而说：“丰收了，有的是钱，弄坏了点东西不算什么，以后再买新的好的来使。”社员们对此都十分气愤。爱护社内公共财产是每一个社员的责任，而这个社的干部却如此大手大脚，大量浪费。所以，我们希望有关部门应当检查一下，反掉这种坏作风。
