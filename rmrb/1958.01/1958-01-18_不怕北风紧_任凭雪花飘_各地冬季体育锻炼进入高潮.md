This newspaper reports: This winter, various regions have successively launched winter sports activities, and the exercise is now in full swing.

The scale of this winter's sports activities is large, and the content is also diverse. Many factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools in Beijing have widely carried out winter activities such as long-distance running, calisthenics, and skating. Especially in universities and colleges, exercise has become an organized and planned activity, with some schools having almost 100% participation. In Jiangxi Province's "Winter Sports Competition," more than 11,000 people in six cities have participated in long-distance running competitions, and 4,000 to 5,000 people in four cities have participated in calisthenics competitions. In Changsha, Hunan, more than 13,000 people have participated in long-distance running competitions, and more than 2,000 people have participated in calisthenics competitions. Most secondary schools and above have organized long-distance running teams. More than 45,000 people participated in the symbolic "Beijing-Moscow" relay race held in Jinan. In Luohe City, Henan, more than 12,000 people participated in long-distance running under the leadership of the city party secretary and mayor. This year, there are particularly many people participating in ice sports in Harbin. Many grassroots units have built ice rinks, and the number of ice hockey teams organized by employees and students has greatly increased. Skating and skiing are also widely carried out in Jilin Province, in cities such as Jilin City and Tonghua City. The Huaihe River Council of the China National Harvest Sports Association has universally carried out activities such as calisthenics, track and field, ball games, martial arts, and skating in various units in the middle reaches of the Huaihe River. In other cities such as Nanjing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, and Ningbo, winter sports activities are also widely carried out, especially long-distance running and calisthenics, in which the most people participate.

A common feature of this winter's sports activities in various regions is the adoption of certain forms of competition. For example, calisthenics and long-distance running activities in many places have adopted a competition method of accumulating total scores. Some places have also stipulated certain requirements and reward measures. This has greatly encouraged people's enthusiasm for participating in exercise and adhering to regular exercise.

In order to attract and organize the masses to participate in winter exercise, various regions have vigorously carried out publicity and organizational work. Many places have conducted extensive publicity through newspapers and broadcasts. Shijiazhuang City compiled a publicity outline on "How to Persist in Long-Distance Running Exercise." Nanjing also used buses, shop windows, and cinemas for publicity. In many places, the sports commission, trade union, communist youth league and other relevant parties jointly established organizations to lead winter exercise, and strengthened the leadership of various industrial sports associations and grassroots sports associations over winter exercise.

    不怕北风紧　任凭雪花飘
    各地冬季体育锻炼进入高潮
    本报讯　今冬，各地相继开展了冬季体育锻炼，目前锻炼已经进入高潮。
    今冬的体育锻炼规模很大，内容也多种多样。北京市很多厂矿、企业、机关和学校广泛地开展了长跑、广播操、滑冰等冬季活动，特别是在高等学校里，锻炼已成为有组织有计划的活动，有的学校参加人数几乎达到百分之百。江西省举办的“冬季体育锻炼竞赛”，在六个城市中，已有一万一千多人参加了长跑比赛，在四个城市中有四、五千人参加广播操比赛。在湖南长沙已有一万三千多人参加了长跑比赛，二千多人参加广播操比赛，中等以上学校中大都组织了长跑队。济南市举行的“北京——莫斯科”象征性接力长跑，就有四万五千多人参加。河南漯河市在市委书记和市长的带头下，有一万二千多人参加了长跑。哈尔滨今年参加冰上运动的人特别多，很多基层单位浇了冰场，职工和学生组织的冰球队有很大的增加。吉林省的滑冰和滑雪运动也在吉林市和通化市等地广泛展开。中国丰收体育协会淮河理事会，在治淮中游各单位普遍开展广播操、田径、球类、武术、滑冰等活动。在其他如南京、天津、石家庄、张家口、唐山、宁波等城市冬季体育锻炼也都广泛开展起来，特别是长跑和广播操两项参加的人最多。
    今冬各地的体育锻炼有一个共同的特点，就是都采取了一定的竞赛的形式。如很多地方开展的广播操和长跑活动都采取了累计总成绩的比赛办法。有的地方还规定了一定的要求和奖励办法。这样就大大鼓舞了人们参加锻炼和坚持经常锻炼的积极性。
    为了吸引和组织广大群众参加冬季锻炼，各地都大力进行了宣传工作和组织工作。许多地方通过报刊和广播等进行了广泛的宣传。石家庄市编写了“怎样坚持长跑锻炼”宣传提纲。南京还利用了公共汽车、商店橱窗和电影院进行宣传。许多地方体委、工会、共青团等各有关方面联合成立了领导冬季锻炼的组织，加强了各产业体协和基层体协对冬季锻炼的领导。（附图片）
