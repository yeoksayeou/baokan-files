One Hundred Commando Teams Penetrate Weak Links
More Than a Thousand Leading Cadres in Shanghai Take the Lead in Eliminating the Four Pests

(Our dispatch) Since mid-December of last year, leading Party and government cadres in Shanghai have been leading the broad masses of citizens in launching a winter sanitation campaign.

Regarding the leading Party and government aspects of Shanghai, based on the specific situation in Shanghai and the characteristics of the current season, this winter sanitation campaign decided to take "Three Cleans," "Four No's," and "Five Clearings" as the goals of action. "Three Cleans" means mobilizing everyone to take action to clean up, achieving cleanliness indoors and outdoors, kitchen cleanliness, and toilet cleanliness; "Four No's" means promoting everyone to pay attention to hygiene and every family to love cleanliness, achieving no littering of garbage, no indiscriminate pouring of sewage, no littering of fruit peels and paper scraps, and no spitting anywhere; "Five Clearings" means mobilizing everywhere, making all-out assaults, achieving the elimination of fly pupae, emptying of stagnant water in jars and tanks, elimination of small amounts of stagnant water, plugging of rat holes in extermination efforts, and clearing of bird nests in catching sparrows.

On December 19th of last year, responsible comrades from the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee personally took the lead in participating in one hundred commando teams composed of more than a thousand section-level and bureau-level cadres, going to factories, neighborhoods, animal byproduct processing industries, breeding farms, agricultural cooperatives, pastures, construction sites, vegetable markets, schools, and other thirty-eight units, to carry out surprise voluntary labor. Most of these units were those that usually did not pay enough attention to sanitation work or were places where mosquitoes and flies bred. Through this surprise attack, not only did these leading comrades realize what fly pupae look like, how to dig them up, and how to eliminate them; they also learned why some units are doing a good job in the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests, and why some units are not. More importantly, it vigorously promoted the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests in these units.

When the commando team composed of comrades such as Chen Pixian, Cao Diqiu, and Wei Wenbo from the Municipal Party Committee dug up fly pupae and removed cattle manure at the state-owned Third Ranch, it not only moved all the employees of the ranch to immediately join the battle, showing unprecedented enthusiasm; moreover, the ranch's sanitation work, which was originally nominally managed by a deputy ranch director, was immediately decided to be directly handled by the ranch director on the same day. They also mobilized all the employees of the ranch to discuss and put forward guarantees. Before the end of December, the environmental sanitation of the entire ranch was completely renewed.

The Qiuxin Shipyard was where a team led by Deputy Mayor Liu Jiping went for a surprise inspection. At that time, it was discovered that there was a sewage ditch in the factory that bred the vector of Japanese encephalitis B – the black-spotted mosquito. They immediately cleared the sewage and garbage from this ditch, which aroused the attention of the factory leaders. They carried out broadcast mobilization and health publicity work throughout the factory. They decided to immediately fill in this mosquito stronghold and establish their own sanitation system and labor plan.

The Fuzhou Road Small Vegetable Market, which had been rated as an excellent sanitation unit, had very good equipment conditions, but in the past two years, because it had relaxed its sanitation work, the sanitation situation had deteriorated, and customers had to wear rubber overshoes to buy vegetables. After the commando team led by Deputy Mayor Song Richang went to participate in tidying up the environment, the person in charge of the market held a meeting overnight to study how to restore the original honor and came up with ways to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes and flies and not to attract flies.

Under the influence of the leading actions of the municipal leaders, leaders at all levels and the broad masses of citizens in the city also quickly took action. In addition to using 666 smoke to kill overwintering mosquitoes in the basements of one hundred and sixty-four buildings in Huangpu District, in the key rat extermination work in the eight office areas, the original 70% of households with rats has been reduced to 11%. In some schools in Zhabei District, thousands of students take turns cleaning nearby streets every day. Putuo District organized a labor force of five thousand government cadres, preparing to go to key units and breeding grounds of the four pests to carry out surprise voluntary labor.

### 一百个突击队深入薄弱环节  上海千余领导干部带头除四害

    一百个突击队深入薄弱环节
    上海千余领导干部带头除四害
    本报讯　自去年12月中旬以来，上海市党政领导干部带动广大市民展开冬季卫生运动。
    上海市党政领导方面，根据上海市具体情况和目前季节的特点，这次冬季卫生运动决定以“三洁”、“四不”、“五光”为行动的目标。“三洁”是发动人人动手，打扫清洁，做到室内外洁，厨房洁，厕所洁；“四不”是提倡人人讲卫生，家家爱清洁，做到不乱倒垃圾，不乱泼污水，不乱丢果壳、纸屑，不随地吐痰；“五光”是处处动员、全面突击，做到蝇蛹灭光，缸罐积水倒光，小量积水除光，灭鼠把洞堵光，捕雀把窝掏光。
    去年12月19日，市委、市人民委员会负责同志亲自带头参加了由一千多个处、科级以上干部组成的一百个突击队，分头到工厂、里弄、禽兽副产品加工行业、饲养场、农业合作社、牧场、工地、菜场、学校等三十八个单位，进行了突击义务劳动。这些单位大半是平时对卫生工作不够重视，或者是孳生蚊蝇的场所。通过这次突击，不仅使这些领导同志认识蝇蛹是什么样子，怎样挖掘，怎样消灭；也使他们了解到有些单位为什么爱国卫生除四害搞得好，有的单位为什么搞不起来。更重要的是有力地推动了这些单位的爱国卫生除四害运动。
    陈丕显、曹荻秋、魏文伯等市委负责同志组成的突击队在国营第三牧场挖蝇蛹除牛粪的时候，不仅感动了该场全体职工立即投入战斗，出现了前所未有的劲头；而且这个场的卫生工作原来只由一个副场长挂挂名的，当天就决定由正场长直接来抓，还发动全场职工讨论，提出了保证。在12月底前，全场的环境卫生面貌就焕然一新。
    求新造船厂是由刘季平副市长率领的一小组前去突击的。当时发现了该厂有一条孳生乙型脑炎媒介——黑斑蚊的污水浜，就立即把这条浜的污水垃圾进行了清除，引起了厂领导的重视，在全厂进行了广播动员和卫生宣传工作。他们决定立即填没这个蚊虫大本营，并建立自己的卫生制度和劳动计划。
    曾经被评为卫生优秀单位的福州路小菜场的设备条件是很好的，但这两年来因为对卫生工作松了劲，卫生情况变坏，顾客们不得不穿胶套鞋去买菜。这次经过以宋日昌副市长带头的突击队前去参加整理环境卫生之后，这个场的负责人就连夜开会研究怎样恢复原有荣誉，想出不孳生蚊蝇和不招引苍蝇的办法。
    在市级领导同志的带头行动的影响下，该市各级领导和广大市民也都迅速地行动起来。黄浦区除了在一百六十四座大楼地下室进行了六六六烟熏杀灭过冬蚊虫外，在八个办事处地区重点灭鼠工作上，已将原来有鼠户70％，做到下降为11％。闸北区部分学校，已有数千学生每天轮流清扫附近街道。普陀区组织了机关干部五千人的劳动大军，准备到各重点单位和四害孳生场所进行突击义务劳动。
