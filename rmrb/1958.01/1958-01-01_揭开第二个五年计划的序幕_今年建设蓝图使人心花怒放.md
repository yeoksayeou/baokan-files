    Unveiling the Second Five-Year Plan
    This Year's Construction Blueprint Inspires Excitement

    This newspaper reports that the picture of the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is a large-scale construction picture, which is reflected in the various plans for 1958 that are being discussed and arranged.

    1958 – the New Year – marks China’s economic construction moving towards the goal of catching up with Britain in fifteen years in terms of steel and other major industrial product output, towards the goal of realizing the forty-article program for agricultural development, and continuing to advance under the guidance of the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily with more, faster, better and more economical results, with the development of heavy industry as the center, and the simultaneous promotion of industry and agriculture. During this year, in terms of the metallurgical industry, the Wuhan, Baotou, Anshan and other iron and steel companies, as well as the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Kunming Iron and Steel Plant, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, Longyan Iron Mine and other plants and mines will continue to be under construction; the main projects to be newly started this year include the Henan Refractory Material Plant, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, etc. The construction units of plants and mines above the quota that are planned to be completed this year include Daye Special Steel Plant, Ma'anshan Iron Plant, Nanfen Iron Mine, etc. This will make it possible to greatly increase the output of pig iron, steel and steel products in our country. In terms of non-ferrous metallurgy, more than 20 projects will continue to be under construction this year, 6 new projects will be started, and 9 projects will be handed over for production this year.

    In terms of the fuel industry, in 1958, the coal mine construction will continue with more than 120 projects such as the Tongshun No. 2 well of Fengfeng Mine, the Xinqiu vertical shaft and Ping'an vertical shaft of Liaoning, the Xing'antai vertical shaft of Heilongjiang, the Wangshiwa vertical shaft of Tongchuan Mine in Shaanxi, the Haizhou open-pit mine and the Fushun East open-pit mine. More than 30 new projects will also be started. The main ones include the Yungang No. 2 inclined shaft of Datong, the Wangzhuang vertical shaft of Lu'an, the No. 2 mine of Lizhuang in Jiaozuo, the No. 6 vertical shaft of Pingdingshan, and the No. 4 and No. 5 vertical shafts of Hebi in Henan. In addition, projects such as the Zhuzhou Coal Washing Plant and the Xieji set Coal Washing Plant in Huainan will continue to be under construction. It is estimated that about 40 plant and mine construction units will be completed this year, with a newly added annual output of more than 14 million tons of raw coal. In the power industry, more than 90 above-quota plant and mine construction units are planned to be constructed this year, including thermal power plants, hydroelectric power stations, and transmission and substation projects. More than 30 projects will be completed this year. After these new and expanded projects are put into production, the newly added power generation capacity will be about 800,000 kilowatts. In addition to continuing the construction of exploration wells in Karamay, Qaidam and Sichuan, the Lanzhou Refinery, Fushun No. 2 Petroleum Plant, Karamay Oilfield and other projects will continue to be under construction in the petroleum industry. Several other shale oil plants and shale mines will be newly built.

    In order to increase the self-sufficiency rate of equipment in our country, the machinery industry will be further developed this year, first of all, the construction of heavy machinery plants will be accelerated.

    In order to promote the great development of agricultural production, the machinery industry department is preparing to produce a large number of irrigation and drainage equipment, and the water conservancy department will continue to build reservoirs such as Sanmenxia, ​​Meishan, Xianghongdian, and Dahuoquan. The Ministry of Chemical Industry will vigorously develop the production of chemical fertilizers. The Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant and the second phase of the Jilin Fertilizer Plant will continue to be under construction. In addition, a large number of fertilizer plants, chemical plants, and pharmaceutical factories will be started this year. This year, about 10 fertilizer, chemical plant and mining projects will be completed and put into production. This will greatly exceed the level of chemical fertilizer production in my country in 1957. It is worth mentioning here the huge scale of water conservancy construction. In 1958, the manpower, financial resources, and materials contributed by agricultural production cooperatives and the masses of farmers in the upsurge of water conservancy construction that has arrived and will continue to rise are extremely huge. It is estimated that the irrigated area will be expanded by about 90 million mu this year, more than double that of 1957. The state has also given a certain amount of investment to support this.

    In other aspects such as the building materials industry, the forestry industry, the machinery industry, the electrical machinery manufacturing industry, the light industry, the food industry, and railway transportation, the scale of construction in 1958 is also huge. This huge construction picture heralds that a new situation will appear in my country's industrial and agricultural production. (Attached picture)

    揭开第二个五年计划的序幕
    今年建设蓝图使人心花怒放
    本报讯　发展国民经济第二个五年计划的第一年的图景是一幅规模巨大的建设图景，这幅图景从正在讨论安排的1958年各项计划当中已经反映出来。
    1958年——新的一年，我国的经济建设，是向着在钢铁和其他主要工业产品产量方面十五年后赶上英国的目标、向着实现农业发展纲要四十条的目标前进，是在以发展重工业为中心的前提下，实行工业农业同时并举，是在勤俭建国多快好省的政策方针指导下继续前进的。在这一年当中，冶金工业方面将继续施工的有武汉、包头、鞍山等钢铁公司，有太原钢铁厂、昆明钢铁厂、马鞍山钢铁厂、龙烟铁矿等厂矿；今年准备新开工的主要有河南耐火材料厂、石景山钢铁厂等。在今年内计划竣工的限额以上的厂矿建设单位有大冶特殊钢厂、马鞍山铁厂、南芬铁矿等单位。这样就有可能使我国的生铁、钢和钢材的产量，大大提高一步。有色冶金方面，今年将继续施工的有二十余项，新开工的也有六项，还有九项工程，今年可以移交投入生产。
    在燃料工业方面，1958年煤炭的矿井建设，继续施工的有峰峰矿通顺二号井、辽宁新丘立井及平安立井，黑龙江兴安台立井，陕西铜川矿王石凹立井，海州露天矿和抚顺东露天矿等一百二十项以上的工程。新开工的也有三十多项。主要的有大同云岗二号斜井、路安王庄立井、焦作李庄二矿、平顶山六号立井、河南鹤壁四号、五号立井等。此外株洲洗煤厂、淮南谢家集洗煤厂等工程都将继续施工。计划在今年竣工的厂矿建设单位估计在四十个左右，新增加的原煤年产量在一千四百万吨以上。电力工业今年计划施工的限额以上厂矿建设单位有九十多项，其中有火力发电厂，有水力发电站，也有输电和变电工程。今年将有三十多项工程竣工，在这些新建和扩建工程投入生产后，新增加的发电设备容量将在八十万瓩左右。石油工业除了继续进行克拉玛依、柴达木和四川等地区的探井建设外，兰州炼油厂、抚顺石油二厂、克拉玛依油矿等工程将继续施工。其他还有好几处页岩油厂和页岩矿开工新建。
    为了提高我国设备的自给率，机械工业今年将有进一步的发展，首先是重型机械厂的加快建设。
    为了促进农业生产的大发展，机械工业部门准备生产大量的排灌设备，水利部门继续兴建三门峡、梅山、响洪甸、大伙房等水库。化学工业部将大力发展化学肥料的生产。兰州肥料厂、吉林肥料厂二期工程将继续施工。此外还有为数众多的肥料厂、化工厂、制药厂在今年内开工兴建。今年还有十个左右的肥料、化工厂矿竣工投入生产。这样就可以使我国的化肥产量，大大超过1957年的水平。这里值得特别提到的是规模巨大的水利建设。1958年，农业生产合作社和农民群众在已经到来并且将继续高涨的兴修水利高潮中所出的人力、财力、物力是极其巨大的。预计今年扩大溉灌面积将在九千万亩左右，超过1957年的一倍以上。国家在这方面也给予了一定的投资予以支援。
    其他在建筑材料工业、森林工业、机械工业、电机制造工业、轻工业、食品工业以及铁路交通方面，1958年的建设规模也是巨大的。这个规模巨大的建设图景，预示着我国在工农业生产方面将会出现一个新的局面。（附图片）
