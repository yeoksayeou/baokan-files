This newspaper, Jinan, 25th: According to the developing situation of the production upsurge in the entire province, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward a new goal of striving to basically achieve the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program in five years.

　　Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, announced this new combat mission on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee at a telephone conference of prefectural and municipal party committees held on the evening of the 23rd. Shu Tong pointed out that the current province-wide agricultural production upsurge is developing in depth, persistently, and comprehensively. About 18 million laborers across the province are engaged in production movements such as basic farmland construction, pig raising and manure accumulation, wheat field management, and diversified sideline economies. Generally speaking, the enthusiasm of the masses is getting higher and higher, and the confidence of the leadership is getting greater and greater. The originally planned targets for agricultural production and basic farmland construction are constantly being broken.

　　Shu Tong required leaders at all levels to always stand at the forefront of the movement and constantly promote the continued development of the movement. In the event that the original plan is broken, the leadership should promptly revise the original plan, consider the progress of production from the perspective of the development trend and conditions of the local movement, and not be satisfied with the already established indicators that are considered relatively advanced. In the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical results, things that can be done ahead of schedule should be done as early as possible, and indicators that can be achieved ahead of schedule should be achieved as early as possible.

　　Shu Tong pointed out that the key to Shandong Province striving to achieve the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule lies in the earnest implementation of the spirit of "seeing five years in three years, and seeing three years in the first year." It is required to strive to complete the production of 35 billion jin of grain this year, and to overfulfill the production plans for cotton, peanuts, and other crops. Fifteen counties (ten grain-producing counties and five cotton-producing counties) and ten thousand cooperatives in the province will strive to achieve the grain and cotton targets of the National Agricultural Development Program. In order to strive to "cross the Yangtze River," one thousand cooperatives producing 1,000 jin per mu should be cultivated this year.

　　Based on this new goal, Shu Tong put forward specific requirements for measures such as expanding irrigation area, storing water and draining floods, soil and water conservation in mountainous areas, raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, reforming the cultivation system and improving cultivation techniques, and increasing the production of high-yielding crops: Expand the irrigation area from the original plan of 10 million mu to 20 million mu, and strive to reach 30 million mu; develop pig farming from 10 million heads to 15 million heads, and strive to reach 20 million heads; increase the amount of fertilizer applied per mu to 4,000 jin, 5,000 jin, and 6,000 jin respectively, and high-yield fields will reach 10,000 jin of fertilizer; expand the controlled area of soil erosion from the original 6,000 square kilometers to 20,000 square kilometers. In order to first strive for a great leap forward and a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, party committees at all levels must build on the achievements already made in winter, make persistent efforts, strengthen leadership over the movement; continue to educate and improve the thinking of cadres and their enthusiasm for leading production, and further overcome right-leaning conservative thinking; quickly revise the current production plans from now until spring plowing and annual plans; continue to vigorously develop sideline occupations and diversified economies; the two major upsurges of production and rectification should be arranged in a unified way so that they can promote each other and improve together; fully develop the party's mass line work style, and use the mass line method to guide the movement; leaders at all levels must earnestly implement the practice of doing things themselves, going to the front lines, grasping key issues, setting an example, and leading everyone to do it. Resolutely overcome the bureaucratic style of just talking and not doing.

　　The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to hold a meeting of prefectural party committee secretaries at the end of February this year to conduct the first comparison between special districts. It will be held four times a year, and the results of the special districts and counties will be announced in newspapers.

　　This newspaper, Jinan, 25th: Tan Qilong, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the secretaries of the Heze Prefectural and County Party Committees, personally built 50 mu of large raised fields in the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Heze County on the 23rd, leading cooperative cadres and members to carry out farmland water conservancy activities after the local ice封.

　　On the 23rd, the weather was cold and freezing. Comrade Tan Qilong, along with Yang Yi, First Secretary of the Heze Prefectural Committee, Di Sheng, Second Secretary, and Yuan Ziyang, First Secretary of the Heze County Party Committee (a vice-governor sent to work at the lower level), led more than 200 cadres from agencies, under the guidance of technicians, broke the cadres' and masses' ideological view that farmland water conservancy could not be carried out in the depths of winter with practical actions on the land frozen three or four inches deep. In the minus seven degree weather, everyone used hoes to dig and shovels to shovel, and the 500-meter-long large raised fields that were originally planned to be built in half a day were completed in only two hours.

　　The cadres and masses of the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative, who originally planned to build large raised fields after the spring thaw, could no longer stay put at that time. They carried hoes and shovels to the fields to build large raised fields, and insisted on fighting the severe cold.

    为五年基本实现农业发展纲要指标
    山东力争今年大跃进大丰收
    今年要进行四次评比，二月份进行专区间的第一次评比
    本报济南25日电　中共山东省委根据全省生产高潮发展形势，提出了争取五年基本上实现全国农业发展纲要指标的新的奋斗目标。
    中共山东省委第一书记舒同在23日晚召开的地、市委电话会议上，代表省委宣布了这个新的战斗任务。舒同指出：当前全省规模的农业生产高潮正在向深入、持久、全面发展。全省投入农田基本建设、养猪积肥、麦田管理和副业多种经济等项生产运动的劳动力约有一千八百多万人。总的看来，群众情绪越来越高，领导信心越来越大，原定的农业生产和农田基本建设计划指标正在不断地被突破。
    舒同要求各级领导永远站在运动前面，不断地促进运动继续发展。在原订计划被突破的情况下，领导上要及时地修订原计划，要从当地运动发展的形势与条件来考虑生产进度，不要满足已定下来的自认为比较先进的指标。应本着多快好省的精神，凡是能够提前办到的事，就尽量提前办，凡能提前实现的指标，就尽量提前实现。
    舒同指出山东省争取提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要指标的关键，在于切实贯彻“五年看三年，三年看头年”的精神。要求争取完成今年生产粮食三百五十亿斤，并要求超额完成棉花、花生等农作物的生产计划。全省已有十五个县（十个产粮县，五个产棉县）、一万个社要争取实现全国农业发展纲要粮、棉指标。为了争取“过长江”，今年要培养出一千个千斤社。
    根据这个新目标，舒同对扩大灌溉面积、蓄水排涝、山区水土保持、养猪积肥、改革耕作制度和改进耕作技术、增产高产作物等方面的措施，都提出了具体要求：扩大灌溉面积，由原定一千万亩，增加到两千万亩，争取达到三千万亩；发展生猪由一千万头增加到一千五百万头，争取达到两千万头；每亩施肥量分别增加到四千斤、五千斤、六千斤，高额丰产田达到万斤肥；扩大控制水土流失面积由原定六千平方公里，增为二万平方公里。为了首先争取今年农业生产上的大跃进大丰收，各级党委要在冬季已取得成绩的基础上，再接再厉，加强对运动的领导；继续教育提高干部的思想和领导生产的积极性，进一步克服右倾保守思想；迅速修订现在到春耕前的一段生产计划和年度计划；继续大力发展副业和多种经济；生产整改两大高潮要做到统一安排，使之互相推动，共同提高；充分发扬党的群众路线的工作作风，采用群众路线方法指导运动；各级领导必须切实贯彻亲自动手，亲临前线，抓住关键问题，做出样子，带动大家去做。坚决克服那种只说不做的官风。
    中共山东省委已决定在今年2月底召开地委书记会议，进行专区间的第一次评比，每年要进行四次，并在报纸上公布专区和县的成绩。
    本报济南25日电　中共山东省委书记处书记谭启龙和菏泽地、县委书记等，23日亲自动手在菏泽县东方红农业社修筑好大地畦田五十亩，带动社干部和社员开展当地冰封后农田水利活动。
    23日，天寒地冻，谭启龙同志和菏泽地委第一书记杨毅、第二书记狄生及菏泽县委第一书记袁子扬
  （下放的副省长），率领机关干部二百多人，在技术人员指导下，在冰冻三、四公寸的土地上，以实际行动打破干部和群众思想上认为深冬不能再搞农田水利的看法。在零下七度的气候里，大家用镢头刨、用铁锨铲，把原计划在半天内修起的五百公尺长的大地畦田，只花了两小时就修好了。
    东方红农业社干部和群众原打算今春开冻后修大地畦田的，当时再也呆不住了，纷纷扛镢头、铁锨下地修大地畦田，坚持和严寒作斗争。
