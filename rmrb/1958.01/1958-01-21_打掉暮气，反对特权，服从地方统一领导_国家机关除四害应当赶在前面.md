Xinhua News Agency, 20th - The Party Committee of the Central Government Organs and the General Office of the State Council jointly convened a meeting on the 20th for full-time party committee secretaries and directors of general offices (departments) of various units to discuss how the central government organs could strengthen the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests. Gong Zirong, secretary of the Party Committee of the Central Government Organs, delivered a report at the meeting. He called on the central government organs to strengthen hygiene work with the spirit of rectification and revolutionary drive. The hygiene work of state organs should be ahead of the citizens; they should obey the leadership and supervision of the local patriotic health campaign organizations.

Gong Zirong pointed out at the meeting: First, ideological mobilization must be done well. Hygiene work must be carried out in the spirit of rectification. The patriotic health campaign was proposed by the Party Central Committee, and state organs and their staff must take the lead and not adopt a "perfunctory" attitude or pay lip service. The bureaucratic style and lethargy in state organs must be eliminated; at the same time, the idea of privilege must be opposed. Organs must obey the unified leadership of the patriotic health campaign organizations of the city, district, and street, and must play a leading role. If the organs do not do well, they will become a scourge in the local area. Second, the "vertical" and "horizontal" aspects must be combined. The districts and streets where the central organs are located are the "horizontal" aspects, and obeying the leadership of the "horizontal" aspects is the main thing. All organs must send capable cadres to participate in the patriotic health work meetings of the districts and streets, and earnestly convey and implement the resolutions of the meetings in their own organs. The "vertical" aspects—that is, various business systems—must also manage the patriotic health work of their subordinate units, just like the meeting convened by the Party Committee of the Central Government Organs today. In the future, the Party Committee of the Central Government Organs and the various organ systems must hold such meetings regularly to convey, arrange, and discuss the policies and measures proposed by the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, and to arrange work tasks and conduct inspections. The task of the "vertical" aspects is, generally speaking, to promote the development of the movement and to convey and implement the policies and tasks proposed by the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee. Meetings of the "vertical" aspects should be held irregularly from the State Council and the Party Committee of the Central Government Organs to the various departments and bureaus. Third, inspections must be carried out regularly, and backward units must be severely exposed and criticized. Bad examples must be published in newspapers, mass visits must be organized, and photos must also be taken. The central government organs must obey and support the inspections of Beijing, districts, and streets. Fourth, the hygiene work of various organs must be deepened to eliminate the four pests. Cleaning is the minimum requirement, which is relatively easy to do, but deepening the work to eliminate the four pests is more difficult. Fifth, hygiene work cannot rely solely on concentrated campaigns. Concentrated campaigns are certainly necessary, but they must also be carried out regularly. All units must have permanent organizations to regularly inspect, commend, and criticize; party organizations at all levels must play a guarantee role.

Gong Zirong announced at the meeting a list of central government organs that had done well and poorly in hygiene work.

Zhao Fan, deputy director of the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, reported on the progress of the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign and future tasks. He pointed out that the momentum and drive of the Beijing movement were not strong enough and not balanced enough; the phenomenon that some state organs were lagging behind ordinary residents must be quickly corrected.

    打掉暮气，反对特权，服从地方统一领导
    国家机关除四害应当赶在前面
    新华社20日讯　中共中央国家机关委员会和国务院秘书厅20日联合召集各单位的党委专职书记和办公厅（室）主任开会，讨论中央国家机关如何加强以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动问题。机关党委书记龚子荣在会上作了报告。他号召中央国家机关要以整风的精神，拿出革命的干劲，加强卫生工作，国家机关的卫生工作应当赶在市民的前头；要服从所在地区的爱国卫生运动组织的领导和督促。
    龚子荣在会上指出：一，首先要把思想动员工作做好，要以整风精神来搞卫生工作，爱国卫生运动是党中央提出来的，国家机关及其工作人员必须带头，不可以抱“应付”的态度和阳奉阴违，要打掉国家机关里的官风和暮气；同时，要反对特权思想，机关要服从市、区、街的爱国卫生运动组织的统一领导，而且要起带头作用。如机关搞不好，就会成为所在地区的害群之马。二，“条条”、“块块”要结合起来。中央机关所在的区和街道就是“块块”，服从“块块”的领导，是主要的。各机关必须派得力干部参加区和街道的爱国卫生工作会议，要认真地在本机关传达和贯彻会议的决议。“条条”——即各个业务系统，也要管自己所属单位的爱国卫生工作，像中央国家机关党委今天召开的会议一样。以后中央国家机关党委和各机关系统要经常地开这样的会，传达、布置和讨论北京市爱国卫生运动委员会提出的方针、措施，并布置工作任务和进行检查。“条条”的任务，总的说来是促进运动的开展，传达和贯彻爱国卫生运动委员会提出的方针、任务。“条条”的会议从国务院、中央国家机关党委到各部门的各司局都要不定期地举行。三，要经常地进行检查，要严厉地揭露和批评落后单位，坏的典型要登报，要组织群众参观，还要照相。中央国家机关一定要服从和支持北京市、区、街道的检查。四，各机关的卫生工作要深入到除四害。清扫工作是起码的，这比较容易做，但要深入到除四害就比较艰难。五，卫生工作不能仅靠突击性的运动。突击性运动当然很必要，但同时还要经常地进行。各单位必须要有经常性的组织，要经常检查、表扬和批评；各级党组织要起保证作用。
    龚子荣在会上宣布了一批卫生工作搞得好的和坏的中央国家机关。
    北京市爱国卫生运动委员会副主任赵凡在会上报告了北京市爱国卫生运动开展情况和今后的任务。他指出北京市运动的声势和劲头还不够，也不够平衡；有些国家机关落后于一般居民的现象必须迅速纠正。
