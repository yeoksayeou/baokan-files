    Domestic Three-Wheeled Vehicle
    The three-wheeled vehicle, jointly trial-produced by Shanghai Internal Combustion Engine Factory, Shanghai Automobile Chassis Factory, and Shanghai Automobile Decoration Factory, is lightweight, flexible, has low fuel consumption, and good performance. This vehicle can also be modified into various types of vehicles for different purposes, such as: station wagons, sprinkler trucks, refrigerated trucks, and small buses. (Ni Shiru)

    Thoracic Surgery Instruments
    Suzhou XinSu Medical Equipment Factory successfully trial-produced some main components of thoracic instruments in November last year -- double-jointed rib bone biting forceps, rib approximators, and bone biting scissors. These instruments are mainly used for bone cutting and lung resection surgery. The newly produced products, clinically tested by the thoracic surgery department of the First People's Hospital of Suzhou, have proven to be of similar quality to imported products, while the price is only one-quarter to one-third of the imported products.
    Now, this new product has begun small-scale production. (Pan Haitao)

    新产品
    国产三轮汽车
    上海内燃机厂、上海汽车底盘厂、上海汽车装修厂等共同协作试制成功的三轮汽车，轻便灵活，耗油量低，使用性能好。这种汽车还可以改造成各种不同用途的汽车，如：旅行车，洒水车，冷藏车，小型公共汽车等。（倪式如）
    胸腔手术器械
    苏州市新苏医疗器械厂在去年11月份试制成功一些胸腔器械上的主件——双关节肋骨咬骨钳、肋骨合拢器和咬骨剪等。这些器械主要是供剪骨与切肺手术使用。制成的新产品，经苏州市第一人民医院胸腔专科临床试用证明，质量接近进口货，而售价只有进口货的四分之一到三分之一。
    现在，这种新产品已经开始小量生产。（潘海涛）
