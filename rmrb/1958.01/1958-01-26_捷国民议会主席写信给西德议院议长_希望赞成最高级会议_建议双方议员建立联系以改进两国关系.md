Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 25th, according to TASS, Prague published a letter from the Chairman of the Czechoslovak National Assembly, Fierlinger, to the Speaker of the Federal Diet of the Federal Republic of Germany, Gerstenmaier.

The letter stated that the recent development of the international situation shows the urgent need to prevent further aggravation of international tensions and to take resolute measures to discuss some issues in order to help stop the "Cold War," build an atmosphere of trust, and create favorable conditions for international cooperation.

Fierlinger then talked about the situation in the world and Europe, and said that the Federal Republic of Germany's government's attempt to continue building the Bundeswehr and equipping it with atomic weapons has aroused understandable unease and vigilance in many European countries.

The letter pointed out that if the Federal Republic of Germany actively promotes the easing of international tensions and guarantees peaceful coexistence in accordance with the wishes of its people, this will be of considerable importance for improving the European situation.

The letter also pointed out that the Soviet Union's recent proposal to hold a summit meeting of Eastern and Western countries deserves serious study by the governments of all countries. The Czechoslovak government has already declared its readiness to participate in such a meeting and to do its best to make the meeting a success. Fierlinger expressed the hope that the Federal Republic of Germany would also give an affirmative response to this meeting.

The letter concluded: "I believe that every step aimed at easing tensions in Europe will also help eliminate mistrust between our two countries, which is particularly important. I am convinced that this course of events will open up the possibility of expanding mutually beneficial relations in all aspects between the Czechoslovak Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

"I believe that contacts between our parliamentary representatives can also play an important role in this regard."
