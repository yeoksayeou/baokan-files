Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Eisenhower's stubborn refusal to negotiate in his reply to Bulganin has caused disappointment and dissatisfaction in international public opinion.

London dispatch: Many British newspapers, in commenting on Eisenhower's reply, said that it attempted to reject high-level negotiations to resolve international problems and ease tensions. This position is contrary to the wishes and demands of the broad masses of the people.

The "Daily Express" wrote that the people hope to implement a "policy of actively seeking peace, rather than creating obstacles on the road to peace. The public is not satisfied with the idea of ​​asking the Russians to first demonstrate their sincerity for peace."

Man-rough, the foreign editor of the "News Chronicle," commented on the British people's views in a broadcast on London Radio on the 15th. He said: "There is no doubt that British public opinion is inclined to hold negotiations with Moscow, and what is most unpleasant is that the West seems to be continuing to cling to a negative and stupid position. For example, Eisenhower's reply has caused widespread disappointment in Britain."

The "Daily Herald" and "New Statesman" also advocated that Western countries accept the Soviet proposal to convene a high-level meeting. A recent issue of the "New Statesman" said in an editorial: "Poland's proposal for a neutral zone could serve as a pilot plan for disarmament among the major powers. Similarly, an embargo or even restrictions on arms supplies to the Middle East could be a valuable attempt at East-West cooperation, while turning this most tense region into a cooled-down area."

British Labour Party foreign policy spokesman Bevan published an article in the "Tribune" weekly on the 17th, saying that accepting American leadership is "the source of disappointment and frustration."

In this article entitled "Someone Must Tell Eisenhower the Whole Truth," Bevan also said, "President Eisenhower's recent message to Congress shows how unaware he is of the growing distance between the United States and the people of those countries that are still allied with him."

Bevan continued, Bulganin's recent letters put forward clear proposals which in themselves would be a valuable agenda for a high level meeting. He said: "The world may well see that the true answer of the United States is an expansion of armaments programs."

Bevan said that, unfortunately, "it seems" that Dulles, the president's principal advisor on foreign affairs, "is now unable to consider anything except from those most fanatical anti-communist angles." "But, during my visit to the United States, I found it difficult to meet one person in any sector of American society who was prepared to say a good word for Dulles."

Ottawa dispatch: The "Toronto Daily Star" expressed dissatisfaction with Eisenhower's reply. It wrote in an editorial that "Eisenhower's letter contains many disappointing elements, the first of which is an almost completely negative response to Bulganin's proposal to establish a rocket-free and nuclear weapon-free zone in Central Europe." The newspaper also pointed out that Eisenhower's claim regarding the German question was untenable. The "Toronto Daily Star" called on the United States to show "its own sincerity and abandon impractical proposals and accusations."

Geneva dispatch: Some Swiss newspapers, in commenting on Eisenhower's reply, believe that it deliberately excludes negotiations.

Baum, a political commentator for the "Swiss Newspaper," pointed out that some of the issues proposed for discussion by the U.S. president had an intentionally propagandistic nature and excluded any possibility of East-West rapprochement. According to Baum, including these issues on the negotiating agenda means once again provoking Russian opposition and causing them to refuse contact. However, there is no doubt that this contact is something the Russians sincerely desire.

The "Facts Newspaper" published in Zurich believes that Eisenhower "actually rejected the Soviet proposal for top-level East-West negotiations," and only "made a few perfunctory remarks" regarding Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe.

    西方国家人民热望谋求和平
    英加等国舆论斥美国顽拒谈判
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：艾森豪威尔在给布尔加宁的复信中坚持拒绝谈判的顽固立场，在国际舆论界引起了失望和不满。
    伦敦消息：英国不少报纸在评论艾森豪威尔的复信时说，这封复信企图拒绝举行高级谈判来解决国际问题和缓和紧张局势。这种立场是同广大人民群众的愿望和要求相违背的。
    “每日快报”写道，人民希望执行“积极谋求和平的政策，而不是在和平的道路上制造障碍。公众不满意要俄国人首先表明和平诚意的这种说法”。
    “新闻纪事报”国外部编辑曼若15日在伦敦广播电台发表评论时谈到英国老百姓的看法，他说：“毫无疑问，英国舆论倾向于同莫斯科举行谈判，而最令人不快的是，看来西方仍要继续抱定消极的和愚蠢的立场。例如，艾森豪威尔的复信在英国引起了普遍的失望。”
    “每日先驱报”和“新政治家”也都主张西方国家接受苏联关于召开高级会议的建议。最近一期“新政治家”在社论中说：“波兰提出的中立区建议可以作为大国裁军的试验计划。同样地，禁运或甚至限制对中东的军火供应可以成为东西方合作的有价值的尝试，而同时把这个紧张局势最严重的地区变为冷却下来的地区。”
    英国工党外交政策发言人比万17日在“论坛”周报上发表文章说，接受美国领导是“失望和沮丧的根源”。
    比万在这篇题目为“必须有人告诉艾森豪威尔全部真相”的文章中还说，“艾森豪威尔总统最近向国会提出的咨文表明，他对美国以及那些仍然同他结成联盟的各国人民之间正在扩大的距离多么不了解。”
    比万接着说，布尔加宁最近的信件提出了明确的建议，这些建议本身就是高级会议的很有价值的议程。他说：“世界很可能看到美国的真正答复是扩大军备计划。”
    比万说，不幸的是，“看来”，总统在外交事务方面的主要顾问杜勒斯“现在除了从那些最狂热的反共角度来考虑以外，不可能从任何其他角度来考虑”。“但是，在我访问美国的期间，我发现很难遇到美国社会任何阶层的一个人是准备说杜勒斯一句好话的。”
    渥太华消息：“多伦多每日星报”对艾森豪威尔的复信表示不满。它在社论中写道，“艾森豪威尔的信中包含着许多令人失望的成分，首先是对布尔加宁主张在中欧建立无火箭基地和无核武器区的建议作了一个几乎完全否定的回答”。这家报纸还指出艾森豪威尔关于德国问题的主张是站不住脚的。“多伦多每日星报”呼吁美国表现“自己的诚意，放弃不实际的建议和非难”。
    日内瓦消息：瑞士一些报纸在评论艾森豪威尔的复信时认为，这封复信是有意排斥谈判。
    “瑞士报”政治评论员鲍姆指出，美国总统建议讨论的问题有一部分带有有意宣传的性质，并且排斥了任何东西方接近的可能性。根据鲍姆的说法，把这些问题列入谈判日程意味着再一次引起俄国人的反对和使他们拒绝接触。然而，毫无疑问，这种接触却是俄国人所诚恳希望的。
    在苏黎世出版的“事实报”认为，艾森豪威尔“实际上拒绝了苏联关于东西方最高级谈判的建议”，而对波兰关于在欧洲建立无原子武器地区的建议也“只是搪塞了几句就算了事”。
