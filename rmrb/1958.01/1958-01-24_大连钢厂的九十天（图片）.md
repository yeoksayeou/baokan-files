Ninety Days at the Dalian Steel Plant

From mid-October 1957 to mid-January of this year, as the rectification movement deepened, the enthusiasm of the Dalian Steel Plant's employees soared, and new production records were set day by day. During these ninety days, 90% of the plant's employees formulated competition agreements between furnaces, sections, and individuals. To date, 219 of the plant's 279 production teams have set new records, increasing the nation's production by 755 tons of electric furnace steel, 3,541 tons of steel, and 291 tons of steel wire, while also reducing costs by 2.11 million yuan.

People often praise the workers of the Youth No. 3 electric furnace as steelmaking experts. The furnace's electric furnace utilization coefficient, metal recovery rate, and other six major economic indicators have reached the advanced national level. In these ninety days, they set eight new records, increasing production by 107 tons of high-quality steel in just the first half of January.

    大连钢厂的九十天
    从1957年10月中旬到今年1月中旬，大连钢厂职工随着整风运动的逐步深入，生产热情越来越加高涨，生产新纪录日新月异。在这九十天当中，全厂90％的职工制订了炉与炉、段与段、人与人之间的竞赛公约。到现在为止，全厂二百七十九个生产小组，有二百一十九个创造了新纪录，给国家增产了七百五十五吨电炉钢，三千五百四十一吨钢材，二百九十一吨钢丝，还降低成本二百一十一万元。
    人们常用炼钢能手来称赞青年三号电炉工人。这个炉的电炉利用系数、金属收合率等六项主要经济指标已经达到全国先进水平。他们在这九十天里，创造了八次新纪录，仅1月上半月就增产了一百零七吨优质钢。
