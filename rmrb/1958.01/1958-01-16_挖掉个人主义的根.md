	Dig Up the Roots of Individualism
	By our reporter Jin Yukun
		"Three-Grade" Work Section
	The No. 3 work section of the No. 2 workshop of Shenyang Air Compressor Factory was once an advanced work section in the workshop and was officially named the Youth Advanced Work Section. However, after the wage reform in 1956, this work section went downhill, and tasks were often unfulfilled.
	During the Great Blooming and Great Contending, twenty-one people in the No. 3 work section jointly posted a big-character poster, saying that wages were too low and generally unreasonable! They demanded that the leaders resolve it. Many people were unwilling to work in the No. 3 work section, believing that they only made small screw caps here, the technology was simple, and there was no future, and they would reach the top at the third grade! They called the No. 3 work section the "Three-Grade" work section.
		Negative Opinions Prevail
	When the Great Debate was launched, the No. 2 workshop branch believed that: whether the wages of the No. 3 work section were generally unreasonable and whether specialization had a future were questions that occurred in the No. 3 work section, but this kind of individualistic thinking was widespread. Therefore, it was decided to use these two topics as debate topics for the entire workshop to resolve the relationship between the individual and the collective, and between the individual and the country. At the first debate meeting held in the workshop, the main purpose was to allow those who held negative opinions to fully express their views. Therefore, at the beginning of the meeting, negative opinions prevailed.
	The most common complaints were: the No. 3 work section was the most tiring, and wages could not be increased! The future of the No. 3 work section was a future of no wage increases! Zhou Qin shouted the loudest at the meeting. He said, "In other work sections, people rest when the tool is moving, but we do all small parts, and the labor intensity is always tight! In order to earn two more piecework money, I even have to run to the toilet and back, and I have to fasten my pants while running! What's the point of doing this? I'm waiting for the factory to be rebuilt during the Second Five-Year Plan to work somewhere else!" Xie Pinqing, who posted the big-character poster, said, "Why was the No. 3 work section an advanced work section before the wage reform, but often failed to complete its tasks after the wage reform? This is because wages are too low, and the wage reform is generally unreasonable!"
	At the beginning of the meeting, everyone complained about the entire work section. Later, I said that your wages were low, and you said that my wages were low, and we complained to each other. Later, we simply stood up for ourselves. A worker named Zhang Weiqing said, "My salary is unreasonable, and it is very unreasonable! I have been here for so many years, please calculate it for me, leaders. In terms of technology, I can do any lathe. When there are difficulties in production, the leaders mobilize me to think of solutions. When it comes to wage increases, I can't be seen. I have improved many tools, don't you leaders know that? Why don't you increase my salary? Am I not capable? Or is my technology low?..."
	Those who had different opinions were listening patiently.
		Can Pies Fall From the Sky?
	Anyone who knew Zhang Weiqing a little felt very harsh when they heard his speech.
	At the second debate meeting, the focus of the masses naturally shifted to Zhang Weiqing. At the beginning, someone asked Zhang Weiqing: "Although you are a little more skilled, you have failed to complete the plan for seven or eight consecutive months. Your skills have not been brought into play. If you just say you have good skills but don't do it, can pies fall from the sky?" Someone else said: "Where is your high skill? If you make five bushings, you will scrap two and a half pairs!" Zhang Weiqing immediately replied righteously: "I failed to complete the plan for seven or eight months, do you know why? Because my salary is low, and I have resentment! It is also true that the bushings were scrapped, that is because I have ideological problems! Can a person with ideological problems do a good job?" Someone asked him again: "You said that you created many tricks, but how many can be used?" Zhang Weiqing interjected again and said, "It can't be used because your technology is low!" "I admit that my technology is low, but you are conservative. After you get the prize, you put the trick in the box and use it yourself, and never teach it to others!" Song Zhenfeng's speech revealed his past, he sincerely said to Zhang Weiqing: "You and I are brothers, I think in terms of technology, you are one of the best in the section, but you have not fully brought it into play. You are always not down-to-earth in your work, and you always have to make a fuss. Originally, we were together, I was the administrative group leader, and you were the union group leader. You are usually too lazy and have a bad relationship with the masses. When evaluating advanced producers, the masses rated you as second-class, so you didn't work hard. You didn't work hard, and later the masses rated you as third-class, so you didn't work even harder, and you often slept during working hours. Later, I heard that the leaders wanted to promote you to be a foreman, and you became active for a while, but as a result, you were not appointed as a foreman, and you became negative again. Originally, your head was full of bad ideas of individualism. Based on these performances, can you say that your salary is low? Can you say that you are justified in making trouble?"
	After everyone said this, Zhang Weiqing was speechless. The next day he said to the branch secretary: "I have been convinced by the truth!"
		There is an Ideological Problem Here
	The criticism of Zhang Weiqing's serious individualistic thinking raised everyone's awareness. Once the thinking was improved, the enthusiasm for debate increased. Some people began to realize that the reason why many people made trouble in the past was not necessarily because there was a problem with wages, but because there was a problem with their thinking. Therefore, at the third debate meeting, the wage issue of the No. 3 work section was debated. Some people said: "In my opinion, the wages of the No. 3 work section are only unreasonable for a few individuals. Some people are 'burping' because they are full, and some people are 'groaning' because they are hungry. Some people have been here for many years, but they take sick leave for several years at a time. Can pies fall from the sky while lying on the kang? Some people only entered the factory as apprentices in 1954 and rose one grade per year. Can they still say it is unreasonable and growing slowly? Can they say that?" Old worker Qiu Linsheng said: "When increasing wages, we have to talk about seniority. Our workshop's old worker Ma Zhanyuan has more than 20 years of seniority, but he is only a fifth-grade worker this year, but he has never complained. Compared with him, can you young people say that it is unreasonable?" Old worker Liang Guocheng also added: "We old workers don't need to increase one grade per year, it is enough to increase one grade every three years." Worker Zhang Hexin refuted Xie Pinqing's argument that the compressed working hours increased, but the wages increased less, saying: "You said that the compressed working hours increased. Who compressed less? Not only you, but the workers in the entire factory and the entire country are compressing. Otherwise, where will the money to build new factories come from? If we distribute all the money, where will the money to build new factories come from?"
	As soon as the atmosphere changed, the activists introduced the investigation of the wage situation of the No. 3 work section to everyone. The No. 3 work section grew the most in all four work sections in the workshop. If there is a problem with wages, it is not low, but it is growing too fast. Why are there so many opinions with such rapid growth? This is because there is an ideological problem.
		The Future is not the "Money" Way!
	Everyone also discussed whether the No. 3 work section had a future. Statistician Meng Qinghui said it well: "If you want to ask whether the No. 3 work section has a future, first look at whether you are looking at it from the perspective of personal interests or from the perspective of overall interests? From the perspective of personal interests, the No. 3 work section is specialized, the technology is simple, and it will reach the top at the third grade. From the perspective of overall interests, specialized production of screw caps and screws is beneficial to the entire factory. Without specialization, the production line will be disrupted, which is harmful to production. Even if it is merged, someone still has to make small screw caps. Everyone thinks that there is no future in doing this work, and no one does it, so air compressors cannot be assembled, which will affect national construction! If national construction develops, we individuals will have a future! Personal interests must be subordinate to national interests." Worker Na Xueli said: "Some people regard whether or not to increase wages as the future. This is regarding the future as the 'money' way! As long as it is beneficial to socialism, I say that there is a future in doing anything. Wasn't a high school graduate who raised pigs a model and met Chairman Mao? Can you say that there is no future in making small screw caps? If the ideological problem is not solved, even if you are transferred to do big pistons tomorrow, you will still shout that there is no future!"
		Dig Up the Roots of Individualism
	The sixth debate meeting was about why individualistic thinking in the No. 3 work section was so serious? Some people believed that this was related to the leadership's past economicism. Worker Huang Fengge used Xie Pinqing as an example and said: "Xie Pinqing's salary is not low, so why is he still shouting so loudly? This is condoned by the section chief Shen Qingchang. He often accommodates Xie Pinqing's backward thinking. In order to make him work hard, he leads him to money. Shen Qingchang often said to him: 'Don't be afraid that your salary is low. I will nominate you as an advanced producer every season, which is fifteen yuan!' He keeps leading him into the eyes of money, how can he not make trouble!" Some people believed that this was greatly related to Xie Pinqing's background in a small merchant family. Worker Guan Hengli said: "Xie Pinqing entered the factory for money. If his demands cannot be met, he will say that his head hurts today and wants to leave early, and he will say that his butt hurts tomorrow and wants to leave early. He often said to people in the section: 'It doesn't matter if I don't increase my salary. If I take five boards of tofu (his grandfather runs a small shop) a day, and each board of tofu earns three corners, 1.5 yuan will be in my hands!'" Li Zhiyi said: "Xie Pinqing's selfish and self-interested thinking has not been transformed at all when he arrived at the factory. His mind is full of money, money, money. He just regards the future as the 'money' way!" As soon as Li Zhiyi finished speaking, Zhou Qin immediately stood up indifferently and said: "I have also said about the money issue in the past, and I still say it now. In the past, I worked for money, and now I still work for money..." As soon as Zhou Qin sat down, the crowd was immediately excited. Worker Na Xueli said: "You said that everyone is for money, I don't think so! Everyone also has a biggest ideal, which is to build socialism!" Worker Duan Baokui continued: "If everyone is like you, for money, will we still need socialism?" Old worker Liang Guocheng said particularly excitedly: "People like Zhou Qin who only care about money, if a capitalist says to you, come on! Young man, I will give you more money! You will definitely be pulled over by the capitalist to engage in capitalism!" Worker Liang Qiguang said: "People who only know about money should think carefully about the past hardships of the old workers. Do we want socialism or just want money? If we only want money and don't want socialism, then our working class will have to be as miserable as the old workers were in the past."
	After this debate, Xie Pinqing felt very painful. He admitted: "I was wrong. I never considered socialism at all in the past." Zhou Qin also examined his idea of forgetting the past. He said: "Thinking of the past, my family had no rooms and no land. My grandfather lived to be seventy-three years old. His home was twenty-five miles away from Shanhaiguan, and he had never seen what a train looked like. A box of matches was used for a year and there were still seven left. Last year, my father came to see me and visited the Forbidden City. He went home and shed tears, saying, 'Could we poor people see this in the past?' This time, the comrades helped me, and I have a little understanding. In the future, comrades will see me in action!"
	Now no one wants to leave the No. 3 work section. Zhang Weiqing, who used to be careless, now also voluntarily reduced the working hours quota of a certain part by one-third. Xie Pinqing, who made the most trouble with individualism, also actively responded to the "Five Goods" initiative proposed by the city's labor model. Everyone is in a good mood. They also elected the section chief as the representative of the entire work section to announce to the entire workshop that the No. 3 work section will become an advanced work section again in 1958!

    挖掉个人主义的根

            “三级”工段
    沈阳空气压缩机厂二车间有个三工段，曾一度是车间的先进工段，并正式命名为青年先进工段。但是1956年工资改革后，这个工段就一蹶不振，任务经常完不成。
    大鸣大放时，三工段有二十一人联名贴了大字报，说工资偏低，是普遍不合理！要求领导解决。很多人都不愿在三工段干，认为在这里专做小螺丝帽，技术简单，没有前途，干到三级工就到了头！他们把三工段称为“三级”工段。
          反面意见占上风
    在展开大辩论时，二车间支部认为：关于三工段的工资是否普遍不合理，专业化究竟有没有前途的问题，虽发生在三工段，但是这种个人主义思想却是大量而普遍存在的，因此决定把这两个题目作为全车间解决个人和集体、个人和国家关系的辩论题。在车间召开的第一次辩论会上，主要是让持有反面意见的人把自己的观点充分摆出来。因此，会议一开始反面意见就占了压倒优势。
    大家抱怨最多的是：三工段活最累，工资又长不上去！三工段的前途，就是不长工资的前途！会上周勤叫得最凶，他说：“别的工段人家干活，走刀时就是休息，咱们干的全是小件，劳动强度总得紧干！为了要多得两个计件钱，我连上厕所也得跑着去跑着回来，还要一边跑一边系裤带！你说这有什么干头？我就等第二个五年计划工厂改建时，换个地方干干！”曾贴大字报的谢品清说：“为什么三工段在工资改革前是先进工段，在工资改革后常完不成任务？这就是因为工资太低，工资改革普遍不合理！”
    会上起先是光为整个工段叫怨，以后就我说你工资低了，你说我工资低了，互相叫怨。到后来索性自己为自己打不平。有个叫张维清的工人说：“我的工资就是不合理，而且是非常的不合理！我来了多少年了，请领导给算一算。论技术，我什么车床都能干，生产有困难了，领导就动员我来想办法，到长工资时，就看不见我了。我改进了许多工具，你们领导上难道不知道吗？为什么不给我长工资？是我不能干？还是技术低？……”。
    有不同意见的人都在耐心地听着。
        馅儿饼能从天上掉下？
    凡是稍为知道张维清的人，听了他的发言就感到非常刺耳。
    在第二次辩论会上，群众的锋芒就很自然转向张维清身上。一开头就有人问张维清：“你虽然技术高一点，但是你连续七八个月都完不成计划，技术没有发挥出来，光说技术好不干，馅儿饼还能从天上掉下来？”还有人说：“你技术高在什么地方？干五个稍套，就废了两对半！”张维清马上理直气壮地回答：“我七八个月完不成计划，你们知道是什么原因？因为我工资低，我有怨气！干稍套废了也不假，那是我有思想问题嘛！人，有思想问题还能干好活吗？”有人又问他：“你说你创造了许多窍门，可是能用上的有几个？”张维清又插上去说：“用不上那是你技术低！”“我技术低我承认，但是你保守，你拿到了奖，就把窍门放在箱里自己使唤，从来不教给别人！”兜了他的老底的是宋振峰的发言，他诚恳地对张维清说：“我与你是师兄弟，我看论技术，你在段里是数一数二的，但是你没有充分发挥出来。你总不踏踏实实地干，总要闹点情绪，原先咱们在一起，我是行政组长，你是工会组长，你平时太懒，和群众关系不好，在评先进生产者时，群众给你评了个二等，你就不好好干了。你不好好干，以后群众又给你评了个三等，你就更不干了，经常在工作时间睡觉。后来听说领导要提拔你当工长，才又积极了一阵，结果工长没有当上，就又消极下来。原来在你的脑袋里充满了个人主义的坏思想。就凭你这些表现，你能说你工资低吗？你能说你闹情绪有理吗？”
    大家这一说，就把张维清说得哑口无言。第二天他对支部书记说：“我算是给真理说服了！”
          这里有思想问题
    对张维清的严重个人主义思想的批判，提高了大家的觉悟。思想一提高，辩论的劲儿就上来了。有的人开始认识到过去很多人所以闹，并不一定是工资有问题，而是思想有问题。于是，在第三次辩论会上，就辩论三工段的工资问题。有的人说：“我看，三工段工资只是个别人不合理，有的人是撑得‘嗝儿嗝儿’的，有的人是饿得‘呗儿呗儿’的。有的人来的年头虽不少，但是一休病假就好几年，能躺在炕上掉馅儿饼么？有的1954年才进厂当学徒，一年升一级，还能说不合理，长得慢？这能说得出口吗？”老工人丘林盛说：“长工资要论年头，咱们车间老工人马占元，有二十多年工龄，今年才五级工，可是人家从没有叫过怨，你们这些小青年跟他比，还能说是不合理？”老工人梁国成也接着说：“我们老工人不用一年长一级，只要三年长一级就很足了。”工人张贺信反驳谢品清的工时压缩多了，工资却长得少的论点说：“你说工时压缩多了，谁压缩得少呢？不但你们，全厂和全国工人都在压缩，不然那来社会主义？如果我们把钱都分掉了，建设新工厂的钱哪里来？”
    空气一转变，积极分子就把三工段工资情况的调查向大家介绍。全车间四个工段就数三工段长得最多。如果说工资有问题，那不是低，而是增长得太快了。增长这么快为什么还有这么多意见？这就是因为有思想问题。
        前途不是“钱”途！
    大家也讨论了三工段有无前途的问题。统计员孟庆辉说得好：“要问三工段有无前途，首先看你是从个人利益上来看，还是从整体利益上来看？从个人利益来看，三工段专业化，技术简单，干到三级就到了头。从整体利益来看，专业生产螺丝帽、螺丝杆，对全厂有利。不专业化，打乱了生产线，对生产有害。就是把它并了合了，也还是要有人做小螺丝帽的，大家都认为干这活没前途，都不干，空气压缩机就装配不出来，那就会影响国家建设！国家建设发展了，我们个人才有前途！个人利益必须服从国家利益。”工人那学礼说：“有人把长不长工资当为前途，这是把前途看成了‘钱’途！只要对社会主义有利，我说干什么都有前途。不是喂猪的高小毕业生当了模范，还见到了毛主席吗？你能说干小螺丝帽就没有前途？思想问题不解决，就是明天调你去干大活塞，你也仍然会叫喊没有前途啊！”
          挖个人主义的根
    第六次辩论会是辩论为什么三工段的个人主义思想会这样严重？有的人认为这跟领导过去的经济主义思想有关。工人黄凤阁以谢品清为例说：“谢品清工资不低，为什么他还喊得这么凶呢？这是段长沈庆昌纵容出来的，他经常迁就谢品清的落后思想，为了让他好好干，就往钱上引他。沈庆昌经常对他说：‘你工资低不怕，我每季给你提一次先进生产者，那就是十五元！’尽引他往钱眼里钻，他怎样不闹！”有的人认为这与谢品清出身于小商贩家庭有极大关系。工人关恒利说：“谢品清进工厂就是为了钱。要求不能满足，就今天说脑袋疼，要早退，明天又说屁股疼，要早退。他自己在段里经常跟人说：‘我不长工资没有关系，一天取五板豆腐（他爷爷开小铺），一板豆腐赚三角，一元五角就到手了！’”李志义说：“谢品清这种自私自利的思想，到了工厂根本没有得到改造，脑子里就是钱、钱、钱，他就是把前途看成了‘钱’途！”李志义刚讲完，周勤马上站起来满不在乎地说：“钱这问题过去我也说过，现在我还这样说，过去干活为了钱，现在干活还是为了钱……”周勤一坐下，马上群情激动。工人那学礼说：“你说大家都是为了钱，我看不是这样！大家还有一个最大的理想，就是为了建设社会主义！”工人段宝奎接着说：“都像你这样为了钱，社会主义还要不要？”老工人梁国成特别激动地说：“像周勤这样光为钱的人，如果有个资本家跟你说，来吧！小伙子，我多给你钱！你准会被资本家拉过去，搞资本主义去了！”工人梁其光说：“只知道钱的人，要好好想想老工人过去的苦处。我们到底是要社会主义还是光要钱？如果光要钱不要社会主义，那我们工人阶级还得像老工人过去那么苦。”
    经过这一场辩论，谢品清感到很沉痛，他承认：“我错了，过去我根本没有考虑社会主义这一点”。周勤也检查了忘本思想。他说：“想到过去，我家房无一间，地无一垅，我爷爷一辈子活了七十三岁，家离山海关二十五里，就没有见过火车是个什么样，一盒洋火使了一年还剩七根，去年父亲来看我，逛了故宫，回家就直流眼泪，说过去咱们穷人能看这个吗？这回同志们帮助我，才有了一点认识，今后同志们从行动上看我吧！”
    现在谁也不愿离开三工段。一贯吊儿郎当的张维清现在也主动压缩了某部件工时定额的三分之一。个人主义闹得最凶的谢品清也积极响应了市劳动模范提出的“五好”倡议。大家心情都很愉快。他们还推段长作为全工段的代表，向全车间宣布三工段将在1958年内重新成为先进的工段！
