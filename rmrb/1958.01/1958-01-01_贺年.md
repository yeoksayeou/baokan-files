New Year Greetings
By Lao She

Labor is the most flavorful thing. If you are willing to work hard, even celebrating the New Year becomes more flavorful and more enjoyable.

I remember when I was a child, my family was very poor, so my mother had to work hard as soon as winter came, washing piles and piles of clothes for people, or making new gowns for others, in order to earn some money for the New Year.

My sister and I couldn't be idle either. She helped my mother wash and sew; I helped out on the side—passing the iron, adding fire, and delivering hot and cold water, etc. I also took care of feeding the dog, sweeping the floor, and offering incense to the Kitchen God. I had to do this so that my mother and sister could do more work, increase our income, and be able to eat dumplings on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day!

As the end of the year approached, all the work was handed in, and we were busy preparing for the New Year. Our income was limited, so we certainly couldn't have a lavish New Year. However, there were things we absolutely had to do: new couplets had to be pasted on the Kitchen God shrine, the house had to be thoroughly cleaned once, the incomplete copper fittings on the broken table had to be polished, and some pork and cabbage had to be bought. From the perspective of wealthy families, our preparations were indeed pathetically simple. But we ourselves were very excited.

Of course, we were excited. First of all, the little money we spent on the New Year was earned by our own labor, and it was honestly obtained. Whenever I reported to my mother: the Liu family at the pawnshop slaughtered two big pigs, or the Sun family, who lends money, invited three halls of Buddhist offerings, like little pagoda-like top-notch "secret offerings," my mother would always say: Our dumplings have more vegetables and less meat, but they are the most delicious! At the time, I didn't quite understand why dumplings with more vegetables and less meat were the most delicious. Thinking about it today, I realize that my mother's words had a very high ideological quality. Yes, first, our dumplings were not obtained from running a pawnshop or lending at high interest rates; second, our dumplings were made and cooked by our own hands, how could they not be the most delicious? The Liu and Sun families' dumplings must have been very oily and full of meat, very delicious, but our dumplings made our stomachs and hearts feel comfortable at the same time.

Labor makes us poor people strong and confident. Looking back, in those dark years, how our family survived one difficulty after another, and finally struggled through and gained liberation, we really cannot but thank the Communist Party, and we cannot but mention my mother's love of labor. She did not understand revolution, but she made her children believe that as long as their hands and feet did not stop, they would not reach a dead end, and they would walk with a resounding sound.

Although my mother was also superstitious, offering three sticks of incense to the Kitchen God every day, when she really had no money to buy incense, she would tell the Kitchen God: I'm sorry, I'll go hungry for a day today, and I'll make up for it tomorrow when I earn some money! Yes, she was confident that she could earn money so that the gods would not have to go hungry for a long time. It seems to me that the gods should thank and respect her!

I also realized that labor makes our minds meticulous. No work can be done well if it is done carelessly. If you are careless, you have to do it again, so it is better to be careful and meticulous from the start. Labor and trickery cannot be combined. How else could labor change a person's temperament?

It's a bit strange, but recalling the past, especially the things of my childhood and adolescence, I don't feel particularly sweet. In fact, most of the things I encountered in my childhood and adolescence were neither sweet nor beautiful. Perhaps it is because I was young and simple, and I could remember the things at that time particularly deeply and clearly, so that later, every time I thought about them, I felt a deep, sweet, and beautiful taste. If that is indeed the case, we should be vigilant: are we too good at clinging to the old, and therefore prone to being conservative? If we are immersed in the past, we will not see the progress facts of today, let alone the beautiful prospects of tomorrow. Over time, we cannot help but come to the conclusion that "the present is not as good as the past" and be filled with emotion. This is very dangerous! Conservative and backward people are those who hinder the progress of society!

However, we started by saying that labor is the most flavorful. Yes, if we lived a hard life in our childhood and adolescence, recalling it cannot but be really sweet. The good habits we developed in childhood will inevitably continue to play a role to this day, how can they not be beautiful! To this day, I still clean my own house every day and refuse to let others interfere. This small amount of labor is nothing big and not worth boasting about. However, its role is not limited to keeping the house clean and having a fixed place for bottles and jars. It also has a good impact on my writing life. I wipe the table every day and I also write something with a pen. The labor is different, but the energy is the same, I don't feel comfortable if I don't do something. Wiping the table requires wiping it clean, and writing the manuscript also requires writing it clearly, the energy is the same. I don't feel at ease if I don't do it this way. Anyway, these are all good habits. As the saying goes: "Mastery stems from diligence." In my opinion, if you are only diligent in using your brain and never use your physical strength, your mastery may not necessarily be refined; if you use both, your mind and body will be healthy, and it will definitely be better.

Celebrating the New Year, thinking of the past, I feel that the taste of labor is indeed sweet and inexhaustible. Therefore, I also think of how many cadres and writers are currently in the mountains or countryside, spending the New Year with the farmers. This is truly gratifying and makes me envious. I dare say: you are celebrating the New Year by making dumplings with the fathers and brothers of the farming families, you must be eating the most delicious food, and your stomachs and hearts are comfortable at the same time. I believe that this bit of life experience will forever become the sweetest part of your memory, and once the habit of loving labor is formed, you will be able to enjoy it for a lifetime. Those who have tasted the taste of labor are blessed, because the happiness of socialism is yours! I respectfully extend my congratulations to you, pay tribute to all working people, and wish you
A Happy New Year!

    贺年
    老舍
    劳动是最有滋味的事。肯劳动，连过新年都更有滋味，更多乐趣。
    记得当初我还是个孩子的时候，家里很穷，所以母亲在一入冬季就必积极劳动，给人家浆洗大堆大堆的衣服，或代人赶作新大衫等，以便挣到一些钱，作过年之用。
    姐姐和我也不能闲着。她帮助母亲洗、作；我在一旁打下手儿——递烙铁、添火，送热水与凉水等等。我也兼管喂狗、扫地，和给灶王爷上香。我必须这么作，以便母亲和姐姐多赶出点活计来，增加收入，好在除夕与元旦吃得上包饺子！
    快到年底，活计都交出去，我们就忙着筹备过年。我们的收入有限，当然不能过个肥年。可是，我们也有非办不可的事：灶王龛上总得贴上新对联，屋子总得大扫除一次，破桌子上已经不齐全的铜活总得擦亮，猪肉与白菜什么的也总得多少买一些。由大户人家看来，我们的这点筹办工作的确简单的可怜。我们自己却非常兴奋。
    我们当然兴奋。首先是我们过年的那一点费用是用我们自己的劳动换来的，来得硬正。每逢我向母亲报告：当铺刘家宰了两口大猪，或放债的孙家请来三堂供佛的、像些小塔似的头号“密供”，母亲总会说：咱们的饺子里菜多肉少，可是最好吃！当时，我不大明白为什么菜多肉少的饺子反倒最好吃。在今天想起来，才体会到母亲的话里确有很高的思想性。是呀，第一我们的饺子不是由开当铺或放高利贷得来的，第二我们的饺子是亲手包的，亲手煮的，怎能不最好吃呢？刘家和孙家的饺子必是油多肉满，非常可口，但是我们的饺子会使我们的胃里和心里一齐舒服。
    劳动使我们穷人骨头硬，有自信心。回忆起来，在那黑暗的岁月里，我们一家子怎么闯过了一关又一关，终于挣扎过来，得到解放，实在不能不感谢共产党，也不能不提到母亲的热爱劳动。她不懂得革命，可是她使儿女们相信：只要手脚不闲着，便不会走到绝路，而且会走得噔噔的响。
    虽然母亲也迷信，天天给灶王上三炷香，可是赶到实在没钱请香的时节，她会告诉灶王：对不起，今天饿一顿，明天我挣来钱再补上吧！是的，她自信能够挣来钱，使神仙不至于长期挨饿。我看哪，神佛似乎倒应当向她致谢、致敬！
    我也体会到：劳动会使我们心思细腻。任何工作都不是马马虎虎就能作好的。马马虎虎，必须另作一回，倒不如一下手就仔仔细细，作得妥妥贴贴。劳动与取巧是结合不到一处的。要不怎么劳动能改变人的气质呢。
    说起来有点奇怪，回忆往事，特别是幼年与少年时代的事，也不是怎么就觉得分外甜美。事实上，我在幼年与少年遇到的那些事，多半是既不甜，也不美的。恐怕是因为年少单纯，把当时的事情能够记得特别深刻，清楚，所以到后来每一回想就觉得滋味深长，又甜又美。若是果然如此，我们便应警惕：是否我们太善于恋旧，因而容易保守呢？沉醉于过去，就会不看今天的进步事实，更不看明天的美丽远景，一来二去，没法不作出“今不如昔”的结论。而感慨系之。这可就非常危险！保守落后的人就是阻碍社会向前发展的人！
    不过，咱们开头就说的是劳动最有滋味。是的，假若幼年与少年时代过的是勤苦生活，回忆起来就不能不果然甜美了。小时候养成的好习惯，必然直到如今还继续发生作用，怎能不美呢！到今天，我还天天自己收拾屋子，不肯叫别人插手。这点轻微的劳动本算不了什么大事，值不得夸口。可是，它的作用并不限于使屋里干净，瓶子罐子都有一定的位置。它还给我的写作生活一些好的影响。我天天必擦抹桌子，也必拿笔写点什么。劳动不同，劲儿可是一样，不干点什么，心里就不舒服。擦桌子要擦得干干净净，写稿子也要写得清清楚楚，劲儿又是一样。不这样心里就不安。不管怎么说，这都是好习惯。古语说：业精于勤。据我看，光勤于用脑力而总不用体力，业也许不见得能精；两样都用，心身并健，一定更有好处。
    欣逢新岁，想起当年，觉得劳动滋味的确甜美，而且享受不尽。因而也就想到今天有多少干部与多少作家都正在山上或乡下，和农民们在一处过年。这真是可喜的事，令我羡慕。我敢断言：您们和农家的父老兄弟们在一处包饺子过年，一定吃得最香甜，胃里和心里一齐都舒服。这点生活经验，我相信，将永远成为您们记忆中的最甜美的部分，而且热爱劳动的习惯一旦养成，即能终身享受不尽。尝到劳动滋味的人有福了，因为社会主义的幸福是您们的！谨向您们致贺，向一切劳动人民致敬，并祝
    新年之禧！
