Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Indonesian President Sukarno and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu issued a joint statement here (Rangoon) on the 26th, stating: "They sincerely hope that colonialism, wherever it exists, will soon be replaced by a new international relationship. This new international relationship is based on equality, mutual respect, and common interests among nations."

The joint statement expressed concern about the continued existence of international tensions and the consequent risk of a global war breaking out with the use of nuclear or thermonuclear weapons. It called on all countries in the world to support and strengthen the United Nations to fulfill its mission of maintaining peace.

In the joint statement, the two leaders stated, "They are convinced that handling relations between countries according to the principles that formed the basis of the Bandung Conference declaration would greatly contribute to achieving the goal of maintaining peace."

The joint statement said that Burma fully supports Indonesia's claim to sovereignty over West Irian and strongly hopes that this issue will soon be resolved through negotiations.

The joint statement pointed out that the two leaders firmly believe that restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations would be another important factor in achieving world stability and world peace.

The joint statement also stated that Prime Minister U Nu has accepted President Sukarno's invitation to visit Indonesia later this year.

After signing the joint statement, President Sukarno flew from Rangoon to Bangkok that afternoon for a visit. Thai Prime Minister Nai Thanom, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Narathip, and others welcomed the distinguished Indonesian guest at the airport.

    苏加诺和吴努联合声明
    应以万隆原则处理国际关系
    据新华社讯　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺和缅甸总理吴努26日在这里（仰光）发表的一项联合声明说：“他们热诚地希望不管在那里存在的殖民主义不久都会被一种新的国际关系所代替。这种新的国际关系是以各国间的平等、相互尊重和共同利益为基础的”。
    联合声明对于国际紧张局势的继续存在和因而存在着爆发使用核武器或热核武器的全球战争的危险表示忧虑。它要求世界各国支持和加强联合国，以执行它的维护和平的任务。
    两位领导人在联合声明中表示，“他们确信，应当用作为万隆会议宣言的基础的各项原则来处理各国之间的关系，这将会大大有助于达到维护和平的目的”。
    联合声明说，缅甸完全支持印度尼西亚对西伊里安主权的要求，并且强烈地希望，这个问题不久会通过谈判获得解决。
    联合声明指出，两位领导人坚决地认为，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位，将是取得世界稳定和世界和平的另一项重要因素。
    联合声明还说，吴努总理已经接受了苏加诺总统的邀请，将在今年年内前往印度尼西亚访问。
    苏加诺总统在联合声明上签字以后，当天下午从仰光乘飞机到达曼谷，进行访问。泰国总理乃他侬、副总理兼外交部长那拉底等到机场欢迎印度尼西亚贵宾。
