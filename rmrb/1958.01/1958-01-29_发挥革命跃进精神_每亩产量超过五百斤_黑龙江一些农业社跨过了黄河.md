Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 28th: Last year, eighty-nine agricultural cooperatives and five townships in Heilongjiang Province achieved the target of 400 jin of grain per mu as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule. Some agricultural cooperatives have even crossed the Yellow River, with per-mu yields approaching or exceeding the 500 jin mark. The Ailu Agricultural Cooperative in Changan Township, Wuchang County, planted more than 1,600 mu of land last year, yielding 612 jin of rice per mu. The Minle Township in the same county had an average per-mu yield of 433 jin of rice on its more than 22,000 mu of land. Even more noteworthy than these two examples is the Jinsha Agricultural Cooperative in Yanshou County, where the per-mu yield of more than 1,400 mu of rice, planted for the first time last year, reached as high as 666 jin.

Heilongjiang Province is a relatively late-developing region with fertile soil and abundant water resources, but the annual frost-free period is only 90 to 130 days, and there is a large area of land with a small population. The townships and cooperatives that achieved the target of 400 jin per mu ahead of schedule mainly gave play to the revolutionary spirit of the Great Leap Forward, improved farming methods in accordance with local conditions, built water conservancy projects, and overcame various difficulties to achieve high yields. For example, the Jinsha Agricultural Cooperative in Yanshou County originally had several thousand mu of low-lying land that suffered from waterlogging and reduced production for many years. Last year, the cooperative members went all out to build water conservancy projects and converted all the waterlogged land into paddy fields, which increased the per-mu yield of the cooperative's more than 7,000 mu of farmland from the original 77 jin to 436 jin.

### 发挥革命跃进精神　每亩产量超过五百斤  黑龙江一些农业社跨过了黄河

    发挥革命跃进精神　每亩产量超过五百斤
    黑龙江一些农业社跨过了黄河
    新华社哈尔滨28日电　黑龙江省去年有八十九个农业社、五个乡提前实现了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的亩产粮食四百斤的指标。有一些农业社并已跨过黄河，每亩产量接近或超过五百斤的指标。五常县长安乡爱路农业社去年全社种了一千六百多亩地，每亩产稻谷六百一十二斤。这个县民乐乡全乡二万二千多亩地，平均亩产水稻四百三十三斤。比这两个例子更引人注意的是延寿县金沙农业社，这个社去年第一次种的水稻中，就有一千四百多亩每亩产量高达六百六十六斤。
    黑龙江省是开发较晚的地区，土质肥沃，水利资源丰富，但是每年的无霜期只有九十天到一百三十天，而且地多人少。提前实现亩产四百斤指标的乡、社，主要是发挥了革命的跃进精神，因地制宜地改进耕作方法，兴修水利，战胜各种困难，才获得了高产。例如延寿县金沙农业社，本来有几千亩洼地多年受涝减产，去年社员们一鼓作气地兴修水利，将涝洼地全部改为水田，就使全社七千多亩农田从原来亩产七十七斤提高到了四百三十六斤。
