    The convening of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference and its great achievements are having a profound impact worldwide. Newspapers in many countries have pointed out the historical significance of the Cairo Conference, which was attended by representatives from nearly fifty Asian and African countries, and generally believe that this conference further developed the Bandung Spirit, marking the great unity of the Asian and African people under the banner of peace, independence, and friendly cooperation.

    Today, the awakened Asian and African people cannot tolerate Western colonialists manipulating their fate again. The Asian and African people are determined to become masters of their own destiny. Therefore, the Burmese "People's Daily" editorial pointed out: "The convening of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference shows that the people of Asian and African countries are working hard to determine their own destiny." Damascus's "Al-Nour" firmly stated: "Asian and African affairs must be discussed by the people of Asia and Africa, and not by those who meet in Paris, London, or New York."

    Newspapers in various countries believe that the achievements of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference are a great victory for the Asian and African people's struggle for freedom and independence, and another serious blow to the forces of imperialism and colonialism. This conference vividly demonstrates that the powerful national independence movement has developed from Asia to Africa, and the vast people of Africa who have suffered from colonial oppression for centuries have also stood up. Cairo's "People's Daily" wrote: "The conference is full of anti-colonialist spirit, which will eventually show its destructive significance to imperialism." Beirut's "Al Siyasa" said that the conference showed that "the people of Asian and African countries are determined to completely get rid of imperialist rule." Damascus's "Al-Nour" said, "The people of Asian and African countries declared that the Eisenhower Doctrine and the Baghdad Pact are tools used by imperialism to enslave Middle Eastern countries. The conference demanded that the people of Asian and African countries be granted independence." New Delhi's "The Tribune" wrote: Imperialists, the most vicious enemy of mankind, "facing the united strength of Asian and African countries and the opposition of other freedom-loving people in the world, their hegemony can no longer be maintained for long."

    The world recognizes that the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is a conference for peace, and its resolutions are fully in line with the peaceful aspirations of all mankind, making brilliant contributions to the cause of world peace. This conference once again demonstrated that the Asian and African people have emerged on the international stage as a new and powerful force for peace, and are playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. Cairo's "People's Daily" wrote: "The spirit of unity displayed at the conference is a clear symbol of the determination of the Asian and African people to join hands and strive to ensure world peace and world happiness." "Al-Ahram" pointed out: "The Asian and African people, who have always been regarded as cannon fodder and war sacrifices and who have always fought for the interests of certain powers in the past, will today fight to prevent war and prevent their children from suffering the same fate."

    The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference showed that the forces of peace greatly outweigh the imperialist forces of war. Italy's "l'Unità" pointed out that this conference "shows the great superiority of the forces of peace." Cairo's "People's Daily" wrote: The resolutions of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference are "another world declaration of human rights," which will be "supported by the people of all countries in the world, because it safeguards world peace and strongly opposes hegemony, exploitation, and war." Beirut's "Al-Hayat" said: "The conference declaration once again proves its participants' loyalty to the Bandung Principles and their willingness to cooperate in the cause of maintaining peace and guaranteeing human welfare."

    Now, even some Western bourgeois propagandists who are slightly more sober cannot but admit the tremendous changes taking place in Asia and Africa. "Wiener Zeitung" wrote: The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference reflects this living historical fact: "During the period of colonial rule, the past greatness of these countries was forgotten... But now the pendulum has swung back, and hundreds of millions of people have once again had a huge impact on world politics." West Germany's "Die Welt" also admitted that the century of colonialism is gone forever, "the sooner London, Paris, and The Hague understand this, the better it will be for the West."

    However, the imperialists in Washington, London, and Paris still refuse to admit the facts, and unscrupulously slander and vilify the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, and pretend to be calm in an attempt to belittle the great significance of this conference. American officials asked people "not to overemphasize this conference" and said that the resolutions of the conference "will not have any effect." The United States Information Agency desperately collected fallacies that were hostile to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, saying that this conference "does not represent anyone."

    Obviously, behind these slanders and vilifications lies the imperialists' insane hostility towards the Asian and African national independence movements. Associated Press reporter William Ryan's January 8th telegram is an example. Ryan wrote: "Black Africa is ominously turbulent," and "Pan-African nationalism is rapidly becoming as powerful a force as Pan-Arabism in the Middle East." Therefore, this loyal spokesperson for Washington, who was undoubtedly shocked by the anti-colonialist torrent of the Asian and African people, shouted: The West "should never neglect" African nationalism (!) "This force must be countered" (!)

    However, no matter how the imperialists curse, shout, and rant, they have no way to stop the great historical trend of the Asian and African people striving for peace and freedom. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference shows that, encouraged by the world situation in which the East wind prevails over the West wind, the Asian and African people have further strengthened their fighting courage and confidence in victory. The Asian and African people, together with the people of all countries in the world, are fully capable of defeating any aggression and attack by imperialism. The Asian and African people firmly believe that the day when the colonial system is completely eliminated from the earth is not far away.

    伟大的历史潮流
    冯之丹
    亚非人民团结大会的召开和它的伟大成就，正在全世界发生深刻的影响。许多国家的报刊都指出了有亚非近五十个国家的代表参加的开罗会议的历史意义，并且普遍地认为，这个会议进一步发展了万隆精神，标志着亚非人民在和平、独立与友好合作的旗帜下所形成的大团结。
    今天，觉醒了的亚非人民不能容忍西方殖民者再来摆布他们的命运。亚非人民决心要成为他们自己命运的主宰者。因此，缅甸“人民报”的社论指出：“亚非团结会议的召开表明亚非各国人民正在为决定自己的命运而努力。”大马士革的“光明报”坚决地声称：“亚非事务必须由亚非人民来讨论，而不能由那些在巴黎、伦敦或纽约开会的人来讨论。”
    各国报刊认为，亚非人民团结大会的成就是亚非人民争取自由与独立斗争的伟大胜利，是对帝国主义与殖民主义势力的又一次严重的打击。这次大会并且生动地表明，强大的民族独立运动已经从亚洲发展到非洲，几世纪以来深受殖民主义压迫的非洲广大人民也已经站起来了。开罗“人民报”写道：“大会充满了反殖民主义的精神，这种精神终于会显示出它对帝国主义是有毁灭意义的。”贝鲁特的“政治报”说，大会表明，“亚非国家人民决心彻底摆脱帝国主义统治。”大马士革“光明报”说，“亚非各国人民宣称，艾森豪威尔主义和巴格达条约是帝国主义用来奴役中东国家的工具。大会要求给予亚非各国人民以独立。”新德里的“论坛报”写道：人类最凶恶的敌人帝国主义者在“面临亚非国家的联合力量和世界其他爱好自由的人们的反对下，他们的霸权再也不能保持多久了。”
    全世界公认，亚非人民团结大会是一个和平的大会，它的决议完全符合于全人类的和平愿望，为世界和平事业作出了辉煌的贡献。这一会议再一次表明了亚非人民已经作为一支新的强大的和平力量出现在国际舞台上，并且对于国际事务起着日益巨大的作用。开罗“人民报”写道：“会议上所表现出来的团结精神，就是亚非人民决心携起手来，努力确保世界和平以及世界幸福的一种明显的象征。”“金字塔报”指出：“一向被当作炮灰和战争牺牲品的、在过去总是为某些大国的利益而作战的亚非人民，今天将为防止战争并使自己的孩子不致遭受同样的命运而斗争。”
    亚非人民团结大会显示了和平力量大大地超过了帝国主义战争势力。意大利“团结报”指出，这次会议“显示出和平力量的巨大的优势”。开罗“人民报”写道：亚非人民团结大会的决议是“又一篇世界性的人权宣言”，它将“受到全世界各国人民的拥护，因为它维护世界和平并且强烈地反对霸权、剥削和战争”。贝鲁特的“日报”说：“大会宣言再一次证明它的参加者对万隆原则的忠诚以及他们在维护和平和保障人类福利的事业中合作的意志。”
    现在就连头脑稍为清醒一些的西方资产阶级的宣传家也不能不承认亚非两洲所发生的巨大变化。“维也纳日报”写道：亚非人民团结大会反映了这个活生生的历史事实：“在殖民主义统治时期，这些国家过去的伟大被忘却了……但是现在钟摆又摆回来了，亿万人民再次对世界政治发生了巨大影响。”西德的“世界报”也承认，殖民主义的世纪已经一去不复返了，“伦敦、巴黎和海牙能够越早理解这一点，对西方就越有好处”。
    但是，华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎的帝国主义者，仍然死不承认事实，而一味对亚非人民团结大会进行无耻的诽谤和污蔑，并且故作镇静地妄想贬低这个大会的重大意义。美国官员要求人们“不应该过分重视这个会议”，并且说大会的决议是“不会有什么效果”的。美国新闻处拼命搜罗敌视亚非人民团结大会的谰言说，这个大会“并不代表任何人”。
    很明显，在这些污蔑和诽谤的背后，隐藏着的是帝国主义对于亚非民族独立运动的疯狂的敌视。美联社记者威廉·瑞安1月8日的电讯就是一个例证。瑞安写道：“黑色非洲正在不吉地动荡着”，“泛非洲民族主义正在迅速地成为像中东泛阿拉伯主义那样有力的势力”。因此，这个无疑已被亚非人民反殖民主义的洪流所震惊了的华盛顿的忠实代言人大叫：对于非洲的民族主义“西方决不应该由于疏忽而听之任之”（！）“必须反击这种力量”（！）
    但是，不管帝国主义怎样咒诅、喊叫、暴跳，他们都没有办法阻挡亚非人民争取和平与自由的伟大的历史潮流。亚非人民团结大会表明，在东风压倒西风的世界形势的鼓舞下，亚非人民更加增强了自己的斗争勇气和胜利信心。亚非人民同世界各国人民在一起，完全有力量打败帝国主义的任何侵略和进攻。亚非人民坚定地相信，从地球上彻底消灭殖民制度的日子已经不远了。
