Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 29th: In order to promote the rapid surge of the national economy and solve the longer-term tasks in economic construction, Soviet economic regions are discussing and formulating long-term plans for the development of the national economy for 1959-1965, based on the decision of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers on the formulation of long-term plans for the development of the national economy for 1959-1965. While formulating long-term plans, each economic region is also finalizing its 1958 production plan.

This time, when formulating the seven-year perspective plan, each economic region generally adopted the method of first having the employees of each enterprise conduct full discussions and put forward basic opinions on the plan, then having the various administrations under the National Economic Committee of the economic region conduct discussions, and then submitting them to the National Economic Committee for review. At present, the employees of many regions have repeatedly discussed the plans, and the National Economic Committee is conducting discussions and research.

The seven-year perspective plan of each economic region includes plans for the comprehensive development and full exploration of production potential in the region, the implementation of measures related to the specialization and collaboration of industrial enterprises, the strengthening of economic ties with other economic regions, and construction plans.

The seven-year perspective plan of the Tyumen Economic Region in Siberia stipulates that the output of various inland navigation vessels should be greatly increased, machine-building factories should be built, and timber production should be increased. This economic region will establish five new mechanized timber logging yards, nine furniture factories, and standard housing construction factories this year. The seven-year perspective plan of the Smolensk Economic Region stipulates that the total industrial output of the region will be doubled, and it also stipulates that mining and machine-building industries should be developed in the region and seventy-five new enterprises should be established. The seven-year perspective plan of the Stavropol Economic Region stipulates that local natural resources and potential should be widely utilized to develop the production of oil, gas, chemicals, and non-ferrous metals. Many oil and gas fields have been discovered in this economic region, and the perspective plan proposes to drill a large number of oil wells in the oil fields, lay oil pipelines, and build highways between the oil production areas. The perspective plan of this economic region also stipulates that local natural gas should be used to build joint enterprises for nitrogen fertilizer, plastics, and carbon black.

The perspective plan of the Estonian Economic Region stipulates the task of training cadres to adapt to the economic development of the region. This economic region will develop the manufacturing of instruments and tools in the next few years, so the plan stipulates that cadres in the fields of precision machinery, automation, television machinery, and electrical measuring instruments should be trained; in addition, engineers should be trained for the textile, food, paper, and other industries. The plan of this economic region also stipulates that a large number of cadres should be trained by methods that do not separate them from production, and the number of students in night schools and correspondence schools in the region will increase by 50% in seven years. The seven-year perspective plan of the Buryat-Mongolian Economic Region stipulates that industrial output will be doubled in seven years, and the power, fuel, and timber industries will be developed, and coal mining will be increased fourfold.

    新华社莫斯科29日电　为了促进国民经济的迅速高涨和解决经济建设中比较长远的任务，苏联各经济区根据苏共中央和苏联部长会议关于制定1959—1965年发展国民经济长期计划的决定，正在讨论、制定发展国民经济七年远景计划。各经济区在制定远景计划的同时，也正在最后确定1958年的生产计划。
    这次各经济区在制定七年远景计划时一般是采取了先由各企业职工进行充分讨论，提出关于计划的基本意见，再由经济区国民经济委员会所属各管理局进行讨论，然后交国民经济委员会审查。现在，许多地区的企业职工已经反复讨论完毕，国民经济委员会正在进行讨论研究。
    各经济区的七年远景计划中包括本经济区综合发展和全盘发掘生产潜力的计划，实行有关工业企业专业化、协作化和加强同其他经济区经济联系的各项措施，以及建设计划。
    西伯利亚秋明经济区的七年远景计划规定要大量增产各种内河航行用的船只，修建机器制造工厂，以及增加木材的产量。这个经济区在今年内就要建立五个新的机械化木材采伐场，九个家具工厂和标准房屋建造厂。斯摩棱斯克经济区的七年远景计划规定，本区的工业总产量将增加一倍，还规定要在本区开始发展采矿工业和机器制造工业，以及建立七十五个新的企业。斯塔夫罗波尔经济区的七年远景计划规定要广泛地利用当地的自然资源和潜力来发展石油、煤气、化学和有色金属的生产。在这个经济区内，已经发现了许多石油和煤气产地，远景计划提出要在石油产地开凿大批油井，并且敷设输油管和建筑各石油产区之间的公路。这个经济区的远景计划还规定要利用当地的天然煤气来建设氮肥、塑料、炭黑的联合企业。
    爱沙尼亚经济区的远景计划规定了适应本区经济发展的培养干部的任务。这个经济区要在最近几年内发展仪器和工具制造业，因此计划规定要培养精密机械、自动化、电视机械、电力测量仪器各方面的干部；此外还要为纺织、食品、造纸等工业培养工程师。这个经济区的计划还规定用不脱离生产的方法来培养大批干部，七年内本区夜校和函授学校的学生人数将增加50％。布利亚特—蒙古经济区的七年远景计划规定，七年内工业产量将增加两倍，电力、燃料、木材工业都将得到发展，采煤量将增加四倍。
