    "Red Csepel" Production Cooperative
    ——Sequel to "On the Former Horthy Manor"
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang

    About five or six kilometers from the town's manor is part of the former Horthy estate, which was originally designated for one of his sons. On this open plain stands a disproportionately tall building, an unfinished modern manor. Currently, only two blacksmiths use a relatively complete room as a machine repair workshop; the rest is deserted.

    A little further away is the former estate management office, the place where the former lackeys and gendarmes lived. Now it serves as the cooperative's office and the agronomist's residence. Not far from the office, to the left, is a row of low, white houses that once housed the families of thirty-four hired laborers, now converted into the cooperative's public pig farm. The newly added granary and cowshed are technical assistance from the Csepel factory in Budapest, which also helped the cooperative install water pipes and electricity. This cooperative was established in 1948. The members were all poor and landless peasants, lacking production tools and agricultural technology. From the first day of its establishment, the Csepel workers extended a helping hand to them. This is why the cooperative was named "Red Csepel."

    They maintain friendly contact to this day, exchanging representatives every Constitution Day. In 1956, eighty guests came from Csepel. The cooperative prepared its specialty dish, "paprika mutton stew," and also prepared wonderful programs of dancing and singing. In the past, they also held labor competitions with each other. In 1957, there was a shortage of manpower, making it difficult to organize competitions. On Constitution Day in 1957, they organized a meeting with the worker representatives from Csepel in Kiskunhalas; therefore, no additional celebration was organized in the cooperative.

    When the cooperative director talked about the current problems in the cooperative, he said that the main difficulty at present is the lack of labor. This is a direct result of the 1956 counter-revolutionary events.

    The town also has thirty families of former gendarmes and ten families of wealthy farmers. There are also some impure elements in the cooperative, those who are usually drunk and causing trouble, the former rural hooligans with poor labor discipline. During the 1956 counter-revolutionary riots, they colluded with the counter-revolutionaries in the town, stirring up trouble in the cooperative, inciting the division of land, and preventing other members from participating in labor. The former gendarmes in the town openly smeared the words "Red Csepel" written on the cooperative's large trucks with mud, and even attempted to enter the cooperative to agitate and promote their propaganda. At this time, the cooperative immediately organized a defense team, with four people carrying weapons and more than one hundred members taking turns guarding. This ensured that the cooperative's property was not damaged, but four families withdrew from the cooperative for fear of being killed by the counter-revolutionaries.

    After the incident, a meeting of cooperative members was held to review those impure elements, and fifteen households were expelled. As a result, the cooperative's labor force was somewhat affected, and some difficulties were encountered in production, but the cooperative's prestige was enhanced. Now, those who withdrew want to return, and those who were expelled are willing to admit their mistakes. Many farmers who have not joined the cooperative also want to join. Several individual farmers have expressed the opinion that if those expelled lazy people do not return to the cooperative, they will consider joining. Therefore, the cooperative members decided that those who withdrew could be considered for readmission, but those who were expelled could not return; let them spend a year or two outside to be tested.

    I asked why some farmers from poor and landless peasant backgrounds have not joined the cooperative yet. The director said that before 1953, there was excessive haste, forced pulling and persuasion, which did not work well. After 1953, Nagy Imre committed right-leaning errors, which greatly挫折了the cooperative movement. At that time, many people believed that individual households had a better future than cooperative members. Nagy Imre touched the farmers' private desires, and individual farmers welcomed his policies, but the production cooperative disagreed with Nagy Imre's policies.

    The cooperative director continued, due to the influence of revisionist propaganda, although some farmers saw that cooperative members were better dressed than themselves and had more guaranteed cultural and recreational lives and health, they always believed that cooperative members were not the owners of the land. Therefore, to guide farmers to join the cooperative, in addition to increasing production and increasing income to surpass individual households, we must also strengthen ideological education to achieve the farmers' conscious and voluntary participation.

    Talking about the heavy workload in the cooperative in 1957, the cooperative director expressed his gratitude to the Soviet troops for their help during last year's busy farming season. The Soviet troops provided them with seven large trucks to help them transport wheat. They often showed movies to the cooperative members on Sundays. The comrades of the Soviet troops told them that if needed, they could help husk corn, but they stated in advance not to offer them alcohol, otherwise they would not come.

    The cooperative director said that the relationship between the residents and the Soviet army is very good. Soviet officers often go to his house on Sundays or holidays to chat, and always ask what difficulties they have and what help they need. Soviet officers regard his home as the home of an old friend. They have all learned Hungarian, and sometimes they use gestures when they cannot express themselves in words, and they understand each other.

    I asked if their cooperative supplies agricultural products to the Soviet army. He said that the Soviet army's grain is all shipped from the Soviet Union. Sometimes they purchase some vegetables and fruits from our consumer cooperatives. We have a surplus of these agricultural products, and they have to be sold to fraternal countries anyway, which saves extra transportation costs.

    Finally, when it came to the direction of production development, their cooperative began to try growing rice in 1955. In 1956, it did not lose money and even made a profit. The Party Secretary, János, added that the state-owned farms, cooperatives, and individual farmers in the entire town planted a total of 3,000 holds of rice, and introduced water from the Tisza River tributary for irrigation. He also calculated the benefits of growing rice. According to the Hungarian market price, 100 kilograms of rice is worth 2,000 forints, while 100 kilograms of wheat is only worth 220 forints. One hold (nine mu) can yield 15 to 16 quintals of rice (3,000 to 3,200 jin), and a farmer who can grow one hold of rice well can exceed his total annual income and build an ordinary house. But the labor is very large. The cooperative director said that this is the problem. Although rice is eight or nine times more expensive than wheat in Hungary, growing rice is not very suitable due to the sudden changes in temperature. The future direction of crop development in their cooperative is to grow more wheat and corn; and the most favorable condition is to develop cattle and sheep husbandry because the cooperative has a large area of ready-made grassland.

    Now the cooperative has sixteen horses, four hundred and fifty sheep, three hundred and seventy pigs, one hundred and eight cows; as well as turkeys and other poultry, etc. In addition, they also have a brick kiln as a sideline business of the cooperative. Besides, there are farm tools, machinery and land, as well as the members' own property and livestock. This is the property owned by the sixty-seven hired workers today. Who is the most prosperous, the farmers can see very clearly, and the road of collectivization for farmers cannot be refuted.

    As our conversation came to an end, the agronomist's wife brought up sliced watermelon and freshly boiled hot corn. I told her that these foods reminded me of my hometown.

    “红色切佩尔”生产合作社
    ——续“在从前的霍尔蒂庄园上”
    本报记者　胡济邦
    离镇上庄园五六公里的地方是过去霍尔蒂田庄的一部分，这块田庄原已指定分给他的一个儿子，在这一片空旷的平地上耸起一所不相称的高大楼房，这是一所未完工的新式庄园。现在除两位铁匠利用着一间较完整的房间作为机件修理工场外，其余的都荒废着。
    稍远一些是过去田庄的管理处，那就是过去狗腿子和宪兵所住的地方。现在是社的办公室和农艺师的宿舍。离办公室不远的左边一排低矮的白房子，过去住过三十四户雇工的家庭，现在已改作社的公共养猪场。前面添建的谷仓和牛棚是布达佩斯的切佩尔工厂的技术援助，此外，还帮助社安装过水管、电线。这个社是在1948年建立的，社员都是贫雇农，缺乏生产工具和农业技术，从建社的第一天起，切佩尔工人就向他们伸出援助之手。这个社就因此而命名为“红色切佩尔”。
    他们一直到今天还保持着友谊的联系，每年宪法节，他们互派代表访问。1956年从切佩尔来了八十位客人，社里准备了自己的拿手好菜“辣椒烧羊肉”，还准备了跳舞、歌唱等精采节目。过去彼此之间也展开过劳动竞赛。1957年人力缺乏，组织竞赛有困难。1957年宪法节，他们和切佩尔的工人代表在基苏萨拉什组织了会见，因此，没有另外在社里组织联欢。
    社主任谈起目前社里存在的问题时，他说，目前主要的困难是劳动力缺乏。这是受1956年反革命事件的直接影响。
    镇上还遗留下过去的三十个旧宪兵的家庭和十户富农出身的家庭。社里也有一些不纯分子，就是那些平日酗酒闹事、劳动纪律不好的过去农村的流氓。在1956年反革命暴乱期间，他们和镇上的反革命分子里应外合，在社里进行挑拨，煽动分地，阻止别的社员参加劳动。镇上的旧宪兵公然用泥浆抹掉社里大汽车上写的“红色切佩尔”字号，还企图进到社里来鼓动宣传。这时社里马上组织了保卫队，四人带武器，一百多名庄员轮流守卫。这样才保住了社的财产没有受到损害，但有四户人家因怕被反革命杀害而退社了。
    事件以后，开了社员大会，审查了那些不纯分子，开除了十五户社员。这样一来，社的劳动力受了一些影响，遇到生产上的一些困难，但是社的威信反而提高了。现在退社的想回来，被开除的也愿意认错，许多未曾入社的农民也都想入社了。有几户单干农民就提出这样的意见：如果那些被开除的懒汉不回社，他们就考虑入社。因此社员们决定：退社的可以考虑收回，但开除的不能回来，让他们在外面过上一、两年考验考验。
    我问，为什么有些贫雇农出身的农民到现在还不入社？主任说，1953年以前犯过冒进，硬拉硬劝，效果不好。1953年以后，纳吉犯了右倾，使合作化运动受到很大挫折，当时许多人认为单干户比社员更有前途。纳吉打动了农民的私有欲念，个体农民对他的政策表示欢迎，但是生产合作社是不同意纳吉的政策的。
    社主任接着说，由于修正主义的宣传影响，一些农民虽然看到社员衣服穿得比自己好，文娱生活和身体健康都更有保障，但总认为社员不是土地的主人。所以要引导农民入社，除了增加产量和增加收入赶过单干户之外，还要加强思想教育才能达到农民的自觉自愿。
    谈到1957年社里工作繁重的情况时，社主任感激苏联驻军在去年农忙时的帮助，苏联驻军曾供给他们七辆大卡车来帮他们输送麦子。星期天常给社员们放电影看。苏联驻军的同志向他们说，如果需要的话，他们可以帮助剥玉米，但事先声明不要招待喝酒，不然他们就不来了。
    社主任说居民和苏军的关系很好，星期天或假日苏联的军官常常去他家谈谈家常话，每次必问有什么困难，需要什么帮助。苏联军官把他的家看作是老朋友的家。他们都学会了匈牙利文，有时话说不出就作手势，也就懂了。
    我问，他们社里是否供应苏军农产品。他说，苏军的粮食都从苏联运来，有时向我们的消费合作社添购一些蔬菜和水果，这些农产品我们有剩余，反正要输往兄弟国家去销售，这倒省去多余的运费了。
    最后谈到生产发展的方向问题。他们这个社1955年开始试种大米，1956年没有亏本，还赚了钱。党的书记亚诺什补充说：全镇的国营农场、合作社和个体农民一共播种了三千霍尔德水稻，并引进蒂萨河支流的水来灌溉。他又计算着种植水稻的好处，按匈牙利市场的价格，大米一百公斤值二千福林，小麦一百公斤仅值二百二十福林。一霍尔德（九华亩）可收十五到十六公担大米，（三千到三千二百市斤），一个农民能种好一霍尔德的大米就可以超过现在一年的总收入，可以建造一所普通的住宅。但花的劳动力很大。社主任说，问题就在此，虽然在匈牙利大米比小麦价钱高过八、九倍，但是因为天气忽冷忽热，种水稻还是不太适合。他们社里今后农作物的发展方向是多种小麦和玉米；而最有利的条件是发展牛羊牧畜业，因为社里有一大片现成的草地。
    现在社里有十六匹马，四百五十只羊，三百七十头猪，一百零八头牛；还有火鸡以及其他家禽等等。除此，他们还有砖窑作为本社的副业。此外，还有农具、机器和土地，以及社员每人的产业和牲口。这就是今天六十七户雇工们所有的产业。到底是谁的生活最富裕，农民们是看得很清楚的，农民应走合作化的道路是不能驳倒的了。
    我们的谈话结束时，农艺师的妻子端上切好的西瓜和刚煮好的热腾腾的玉米，我告诉她说，这些食物引起了我对自己家乡的怀念。
