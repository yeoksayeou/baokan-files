Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in a secret report to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 8th, made every effort to express his opposition to holding a summit meeting with the Soviet Union to ease international tensions.

According to Representative O'Hara, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Dulles "very vehemently" reiterated his well-known stubborn position against negotiations in this secret report on the international situation. He believed that holding a summit meeting was "meaningless" and slandered the Soviet Union as "untrustworthy" as an excuse for his opposition to negotiations. Dulles himself told reporters after the meeting that the issue of holding a summit meeting was "very complicated" and "not easy to solve."

On the same day, U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Affairs, requesting Congress to allocate another $39.1 billion for U.S. military spending for the next fiscal year, in addition to the $345 million remaining from the current fiscal year. He emphasized that the government's military expansion plan will accelerate the development of missiles. McElroy also met with congressional leaders to seek their support. Representative Mahon, Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Affairs and a Democratic Congressman, said that the committee has notified McElroy to testify on Eisenhower's request on the 7th for Congress to allocate an additional $1.26 billion in the current fiscal year to accelerate the development of missiles. He said that Congress's bill on this plan will be ready within ten days, and he believes that this will be the first payment of Congress's "new plan formulated due to artificial satellites."

    美国要备战不要和平
    杜勒斯顽固地反对同苏联谈判
    麦克艾罗伊要求国会增拨军费
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯8日在对众议院外交委员会的秘密报告中竭力表示反对同苏联举行最高级会议以缓和国际紧张局势。
    据众议院外交委员会委员奥哈拉事后透露，杜勒斯在这个关于国际形势的秘密报告里“非常激烈地”重申了他的人所共知的反对谈判的顽固立场，他认为举行最高级会议是“没有意义”的，并且诬蔑苏联“不可信任”，以此作为他反对谈判的借口。杜勒斯本人会后对记者说，关于举行最高级会谈的问题“非常复杂”，“不是容易解决的”。
    在同一天，美国国防部长麦克艾罗伊出席众议院军事拨款小组委员会作证，要求国会在本财政年度结余款项三亿四千五百万美元之外，再拨出三百九十一亿美元作为美国下一财政年度的军事费用。他强调，在政府的扩军计划中，将要加紧进行发展导弹的工作。麦克艾罗伊还同国会领袖们会晤，争取他们的支持。众议院军事拨款小组委员会主席、民主党众议员马洪说，这个委员会已经通知麦克艾罗伊，要求他就艾森豪威尔在7日提出的要求国会在本财政年度增拨十二亿六千万美元来加速发展导弹的计划作证。他说，国会关于这个计划的法案将在十天之内准备就绪，他认为这将是国会“由于人造卫星而制订的新计划”的第一期付款。
