Xinhua News Agency, January 13th News: "I will tell the Yemeni people that in China there are loyal brothers who can be relied on in the struggle, and the Yemeni people can join hands with these brothers on the road to freedom, cooperation, and peace," said Crown Prince Badr, Deputy Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Yemen, when he bid farewell to the Chinese people on the morning of the 13th.

Crown Prince Badr and his entourage left Beijing by jet plane on the morning of the 13th to return home. Premier Zhou Enlai and other national leaders of our country, along with thousands of people from all walks of life in Beijing, went to the airport to see off the distinguished guests.

At the grand send-off ceremony, Crown Prince Badr warmly expressed his pledge to stand with the Chinese people in the cause of freedom and peace. In his speech, he said that during this visit, he had seen three great facts more clearly: the Chinese people, having freed themselves from colonial rule, are completing astonishing construction work that was unimaginable in the past; China has a sincere friendship and a genuine desire for mutual cooperation with the people of Arab countries; and peaceful coexistence among nations has become a natural trend in international life.

Crown Prince Badr said that the relations between Yemen and China "have moved from a stage of spiritual mutual sympathy to a stage of practical cooperation in culture, science, and economics. I believe that the treaties and agreements we have concluded will pave the way for better mutual understanding and broader cooperation. I believe that these treaties and agreements fully express our understanding of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation."

Speaking of his impressions of his visit to China, Crown Prince Badr said excitedly, "I cannot explain to you how much my mood has changed between the day I first arrived in this great and hospitable country and this moment today!"

Braving the bitter cold wind, Premier Zhou Enlai warmly delivered a speech to bid farewell to the distinguished guests. He said that Crown Prince Badr's visit to China has greatly enhanced the friendship between the people of China and Yemen, which has been established in the common struggle to defend peace and safeguard national independence.

Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that the treaties and agreements signed between China and Yemen "are of great significance for further developing and consolidating the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference, and will also promote friendly and cooperative relations between China and other Arab and Asian-African countries."

Crown Prince Badr, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the guard of honor. The distinguished guests circled the airport to bid farewell to the well-wishers, with many young women constantly presenting flowers to the distinguished guests, and cheers and applause resounding in unison.

At around 9:00 a.m., the special plane carrying the distinguished guests took off amidst the fluttering snowflakes. Premier Zhou Enlai, Peng Dehuai, Chen Yi, Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Hanfu, and others standing at the airport, along with the well-wishers, continuously waved to the distinguished guests to wish them a safe journey.

    中也两国从互相同情走上实际合作阶段
    巴德尔王太子热情告别北京
    新华社13日讯　也门王国副首相巴德尔王太子13日早晨在向中国人民告别时说：“我将告诉也门人民，在中国有着在斗争中可以依靠的忠诚的弟兄，也门人民可以同他们的这些弟兄在自由、合作与和平的道路上携手前进。”
    巴德尔王太子及其随行人员13日晨乘喷气式专机离开北京回国。周恩来总理等我国国家领导人和北京各界人民数千人前往机场欢送贵宾。
    在隆重的欢送仪式上，巴德尔王太子热情地表示以忠于自由与和平事业同中国人民相约。他在讲话中说，在这次访问中，他更加清楚地看到了三件伟大的事实，这就是摆脱了殖民主义统治的中国人民正在完成着过去所不能想像的惊人的建设工作，中国对阿拉伯各国人民有着真诚的友谊和相互合作的真诚愿望，以及国际间的和平共处已成为国际生活的自然趋势。
    巴德尔王太子说：也中两国的关系“已经从精神上互相同情的阶段走上了在文化、科学和经济等各方面进行实际合作的阶段。我相信我们之间所缔结的一些条约和协定会为更好的互相谅解和更广泛的合作铺平道路。我相信这些条约和协定充分表达了我们对和平共处与国际合作的认识。”
    在谈到访问中国的印象时，巴德尔王太子激动地说：“我无法向你们说明，在我刚刚来到这个伟大好客的国家的那天和今天这个时刻，我的心情发生了多么大的变化！”
    迎着凛冽的寒风，周恩来总理热情地致词欢送贵宾。他说，巴德尔王太子这次访问中国，已经大大地增进了中国和也门两国人民在保卫和平和维护民族独立的共同斗争中所建立起来的友谊。
    周恩来总理指出，中也两国所签订的条约和协定，“对于在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神的基础上进一步发展和巩固我们两国的友好合作关系具有重大的意义，并且也会促进中国同其他阿拉伯国家和亚非国家的友好合作关系。”
    巴德尔王太子由周恩来总理陪同检阅了仪仗队。贵宾们最后绕机场一周同欢送群众告别，这时许多女青年不断地把鲜花献给贵宾，欢呼声和鼓掌声响成一片。
    九时许，贵宾们乘坐的专机在飘扬的雪花中起飞。伫立在机场上的周恩来总理和彭德怀、陈毅、李济深、黄炎培、陈叔通、张治中、章汉夫等人，同欢送群众一起不断向贵宾们挥手致意，祝他们旅途平安。（附图片）
