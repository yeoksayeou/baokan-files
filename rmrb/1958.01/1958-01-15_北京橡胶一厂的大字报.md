Beijing Rubber Factory No. 1's Big-Character Posters

    Expensive Instruments are Sleeping
    The laboratory bought many expensive instruments in 1956, such as high-powered microscopes, electric balances, thermometers, etc. We bought these instruments that others couldn't buy even with money, but we let them sleep, leaving them unused for a long time. An electric balance cost more than 3,000 yuan, but it hasn't been unpacked for more than a year. I really don't understand when these instruments will see the light of day? (Li Shenmou)

    Adopting "Stray Children"
    After the streamlining of the organization, the surplus desks and chairs in the departments were left unmanaged and became "stray children," scattered here and there. Some legs are broken, and some drawers are missing, and we still have to "cure" them. What a waste! General Affairs Department, do you know that a desk is worth fifty or sixty yuan? If you have any sense of responsibility for the people's property, please collect them quickly! (Technical Section)

  The Cooling Cylinder Entered the Hot Furnace
    The cooling roller was made last June. It was reworked several times, which cost a lot of labor and time. As a result, it couldn't be used because of poor design. It was left in the north courtyard for more than half a year, and now it has to be sent to Tianjin for remelting, entering the hot furnace. This kind of situation is not uncommon in our factory. I hope we can overcome it in the future. (Zhang Baoshu)

    Short-Lived Fluorescent Lamps
    The whitewashing department installed mobile fluorescent lamps, and a dozen of them were damaged in just one month. However, the administrator didn't consider how to improve the installation and management at all, and just planned to buy new ones, not feeling any pain at all for wasting the state's funds.
                    (General Affairs Section Group)

    The Administrator is Too Bureaucratic
    The administrator is too bureaucratic,
    Acting arbitrarily and recklessly,
    Spending more than seventy yuan of the state's money,
    To make a cotton door curtain for the west gate of the brushing workshop.
    There is a stove in the room, and the door is not afraid of the cold,
    What is the use? Please answer, administrator.
                            (The Informed)

    贵重仪器睡大觉
    化验室在1956年买了很多贵重仪器，如高倍显微镜、电天平温度计，等等。这些别人花钱都买不来的仪器，我们买来了，但却让它睡大觉，长期放置不用。一台电天平花了三千多元买来，一年多了，还没有开箱。真不明白这些仪器何时才有出头之日？　（李慎谋）
    收容“流浪儿”
    机构精简后，科室的多余桌椅无人管理，成了“流浪儿”，东一张西一张，随便乱搬。有的腿掉了，抽屉也没有了，还得给他治病。这是多大的浪费呀！总务科，你们知不知道一张桌子值五、六十元？如果你们对人民财产还有一点责任心的话，请赶快把它们收集起来吧！　（技术科）
  冷却筒进了热熔炉
    去年6月作冷却滚筒，几次返工，费了不少人工和时间才作成了，结果因为设计不周，不能用，搁在小北院里半年多，现在只好送到天津去翻造，进热熔炉了。我厂这种情况不少，希望今后大力克服。

    短命的日光灯
    刷浆部安装活动日光灯，一个月就损坏了十几支。但是，管理员毫不考虑如何改进安装、管理，就又作计划购买新的，对浪费国家的资金全不痛心。
                    （总务科小组）
    管理员太官僚
    管理员，太官僚，
    独出心裁胡乱来，
    花掉国家七十多元，
    给刷工车间西门作棉门帘。
    室内有火炉，门又不怕冷，
    作用何在？请管理员答言。
                            （知者）
