Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 5th (Reporter Yang Yi) reports: The nationwide discussion in Czechoslovakia regarding the implementation of the resolutions of the 1956 Czechoslovak Communist Party National Congress and new tasks in socialist construction is nearing completion. After absorbing the beneficial suggestions of all working people, the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee will hold a meeting in the near future to determine a concrete plan for industrial reorganization, which will be gradually implemented starting in April this year.

    Since the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee's letter to the working people of the whole country was published last October, tens of thousands of meetings have been held throughout the country, proposing a large number of suggestions and criticisms. According to incomplete statistics from only four states—Prague, Pilsen, Ústí nad Labem, and Jihlava—279,000 working people have put forward more than 20,000 suggestions and opinions. In Prague alone, 67,000 people have held more than 2,700 meetings, putting forward more than 10,800 suggestions and opinions.

    The purpose of this broad mass movement in Czechoslovakia is to concentrate the opinions and wisdom of the working people, overcome the current shortcomings and difficulties in economic work, improve the efficiency of the entire national economy, and mobilize the entire Party and all the people to struggle for the completion of socialist construction during the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960). The focus of the discussion is the principled plan proposed by the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee last September regarding the reform of industrial management planning and financial work.

    In order to ensure that the discussion achieved good results, the Communist Party carried out thorough and meticulous mobilization and organizational work before and during the discussion. For example, it mobilized outstanding cadres to go among the masses to explain the content of the Central Committee's letter to the people and the significance of the nationwide discussion. Party and government organizations at all levels, as well as various enterprises, established special subcommittees to centrally study and handle the opinions of the masses. Newspapers such as "Rudé Právo" and "Práce" published many editorials and special articles with guiding significance on the issues in the discussion. As of January 3rd, "Rudé Právo" had published thirty-two special pages for discussion, carrying criticisms and suggestions from all quarters.

    This nationwide discussion was conducted in two stages. The first stage mainly involved mobilization and general discussion. From November 15th last year, it entered the second stage of concrete discussion of the industrial reorganization plan. This discussion involved all aspects of national life, and the content was very rich and lively, showing the political enthusiasm and class consciousness of the masses. In the discussion, the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee's economic reorganization plan was supported by the people. At the same time, the discussion also stimulated the production enthusiasm of the workers and staff, enabling the working people to receive political education and exercise, and more broadly participate in economic leadership and state management.

    An important feature of this great discussion is that the criticisms and suggestions put forward by the masses have been dealt with promptly. Many correct and feasible opinions have been put into practice immediately after being studied by the units themselves. Those major issues involving the overall situation have also been promptly submitted to higher authorities and the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee for unified study and resolution.

    捷克斯洛伐克全民讨论即将结束
    捷共中央准备工业改组方案
    各地曾举行成千上万次集会提出许多建议
    新华社布拉格5日电　本社记者杨翊报道：捷克斯洛伐克各地关于实现1956年捷共全国代表会议决议和社会主义建设新任务问题的全民讨论即将结束。在吸收了全体劳动人民的有益的建议以后，捷共中央将在最近举行会议，确定工业改组的具体方案，并将从今年4月开始逐步实施。
    从去年10月捷共中央告全国劳动人民书公布以来，各地已经举行了成千上万次的集会，提出了大量的建议和批评意见。仅据布拉格、比尔森、乌斯蒂、热拉发四个州的不完全统计，就有劳动人民二十七万九千人提出了两万多条建议和意见。布拉格市已经有六万七千人举行了两千七百多次集会，提出了一万零八百多条建议和意见。
    捷克斯洛伐克这一广泛群众性运动的目的是为了集中劳动人民的意见和智慧，克服经济工作中目前存在的缺点和困难，提高整个国民经济的效能，动员全党和全体人民为在第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）期间完成社会主义建设而斗争。讨论的重点是捷共中央去年9月提出的关于改革工业管理计划和财务工作的原则方案。
    为了使讨论收到良好效果，共产党在讨论前和讨论中进行了周密而细致的动员工作和组织工作。例如，调集了优秀的干部到群众中去解释中央告人民书的内容和全民讨论的意义，党和政府各级组织以及各个企业都成立了专门集中研究和处理群众意见的小组委员会，“红色权利报”和“劳动报”等报刊都针对讨论中的问题发表了许多具有指导作用的社论和专文。到1月3日为止，“红色权利报”已经出了三十二期讨论专页，刊载了各方面人士的批评和建议。
    这一全民讨论是分两个阶段进行的。第一阶段主要是进行动员和一般性的讨论。从去年11月15日起转入了具体讨论工业改组方案的第二阶段。这次讨论涉及国家生活的各个方面，内容非常丰富、生动，这显示出群众的政治热情和阶级觉悟。在讨论中，捷共中央的经济改组方案受到了人民的拥护。同时，讨论也激励了职工的生产热情，使劳动人民受到了政治教育和锻炼，并且更广泛地参与了经济领导和国家管理。
    这次大讨论的一个重要特色是群众提出的批评和建议得到了迅速处理。许多正确可行的意见经过本单位研究后都立刻付诸实行。那些重大的涉及全局性的问题也被及时送交上级机关和捷共中央去统一研究解决。
