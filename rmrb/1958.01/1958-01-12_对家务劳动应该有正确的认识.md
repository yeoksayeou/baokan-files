    To the Editor:
    I am a female cadre and the mother of three children. I would like to offer some opinions on the issue of women participating in household labor, in order to draw everyone's attention and seek a reasonable solution to this problem.
    Since liberation, the increasing number of women participating in work is undoubtedly a good thing; however, it has also brought about a series of problems, such as the neglect of children's education, the insufficient number of places in nurseries, and the difficulty in finding nannies, etc. I believe that for mothers with fewer children or whose children have already grown up and whose work ability is relatively strong, even if they have difficulties in managing household affairs after participating in work, ways should be found to solve them so that they can continue to work. However, for female comrades with many young children and whose work ability is too low or who are ill, I think it is best to return home to participate in household labor. Because these comrades, on the one hand, do not earn much, and the family needs to hire a nanny, some even hire two nannies, which increases the family's financial burden; at the same time, their contribution to the work is not great, and they may not even be able to cope with the work, adding superfluous personnel to the state. Especially at a time when urban populations are being actively dispersed, the nanny problem is becoming even more acute. Some mothers, in order to enable nannies to work with peace of mind, spare no effort to accommodate them, increase their wages, and reduce their workload. This has created a bad atmosphere and directly affects the large-scale influx of rural labor into cities, increasing the burden on urban food and non-staple food supplies. This problem was difficult to solve in the past. Now that a large number of cadres are being sent down to participate in labor, a new trend has emerged in society, and it is time to solve this problem.
    As far as I know, some mothers with many children are willing to participate in household labor, but are unwilling to propose it for fear of public opinion. There are also a considerable number of mothers who are afraid that housework is too tiring and are reluctant to leave their work in the offices. There is a mother in our compound who is a demobilized soldier. Because she was afraid of the burden of taking care of children, she started working last year. She openly said to people: it's not about how much salary you get, but about the fact that office work is easier than housework. As for female comrades who covet the high salaries of office work, only seeking a nominal position without doing any work, there are also many such people. Therefore, I believe that in order to reasonably solve the problem of female comrades participating in household labor, on the one hand, it is necessary to widely carry out propaganda to create a new trend in which household labor is glorious; on the other hand, it is also necessary to strengthen the education of female staff members to correct their ideological understanding.

### 对家务劳动应该有正确的认识

    对家务劳动应该有正确的认识
    编辑同志：
    我是一个女干部，又是三个孩子的母亲，想就妇女参加家务劳动的问题发表一些意见，以引起大家的注意，求得这个问题的合理解决。
    解放后，妇女参加工作的日益增多，这无疑是一件好事；但是也带来了一系列的问题，例如放松了对孩子的教育，托儿所的名额不敷分配，保姆很不容易找到，等等。我觉得，对于子女较少或子女已经长成而本人的工作能力又较强的母亲，即使在她们参加工作后在料理家务上有困难，也应该设法解决，使她们能够继续工作。但是，子女较多和较小而本人工作能力又太低或身体有病的女同志，我就觉得最好是回家参加家务劳动。因为这些同志参加工作，一方面是收入不多，家庭需要雇保姆，有的甚至雇有两个保姆，反而加重了家庭的经济负担；同时她们本人对工作的贡献也不大，甚至不能胜任工作，给国家增加了冗员。特别在目前积极疏散城市人口的时候，保姆问题就更加尖锐。有些母亲为了使保姆能够安心工作，不惜多方迁就，给她们增加工资，减轻她们的工作。这就造成了一种坏风气，并且直接影响农村劳动力大批流入城市，加重了城市粮食和副食品等供应的负担。这个问题在过去很难解决。现在大批干部下放参加劳动，社会上已经出现了一种新风尚，这个问题也该到解决的时候了。
    据我了解，有些多子女的母亲是愿意参加家务劳动的，但因害怕舆论的压力而不愿提出。也有相当一批母亲怕家务劳动太累而留恋机关工作。我们同院就有一位母亲，她是复员军人，因为怕带孩子累，在去年参加了工作。她公开对人说：不在得多少工资，而在于机关工作比家务劳动轻闲。至于贪图机关工作的工资高，只图挂名而不作工作的女同志，也大有人在。因此，我认为，要想合理地解决女同志参加家务劳动的问题，一方面要广泛开展宣传，造成家务劳动光荣的新风尚；另一方面还要加强对女工作人员的教育，端正她们的思想认识。
