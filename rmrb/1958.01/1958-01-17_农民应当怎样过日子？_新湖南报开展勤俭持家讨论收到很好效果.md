How Should Farmers Live?
The New Hunan Daily's Discussion on Thrift and Frugality Achieves Good Results

(Our report) The New Hunan Daily, starting from November 15th of last year, initiated a discussion on the topic of "How Should Farmers Live?" focusing on thrift and frugality. This discussion has sparked enthusiastic responses among the broad masses of farmers and achieved good results.

The Discussion Was Triggered by the Liao Haiqing Issue
Thoroughly Criticize Extravagance and Wastefulness

This discussion was initiated based on the suggestions of Wang Guohua, director of the Zhenzhou Agricultural Cooperative in Ningxiang County, and cooperative members like Tong Zhiping. In a letter to the New Hunan Daily editorial department, they reported that after an increase in income, Liao Haiqing's family in the Zhenzhou Agricultural Cooperative became fond of eating and lazy, lacking diligence and frugality. Before liberation, Liao Haiqing's family was a poor household. During the land reform, they were allocated land, houses, and furniture. At that time, his entire family was very diligent. Later, they joined mutual aid teams and cooperatives, and their income gradually increased. However, after a significant increase in income, his family forgot the importance of "diligence and frugality" and began to eat and drink extravagantly. They never invested money in the cooperative, nor were they willing to deposit it in credit cooperatives. Due to extravagance and wastefulness, they sometimes had to borrow money from neighbors and were also in debt to the cooperative. The family's labor force was also not very active in attending work, and even young, strong adults in their twenties were unwilling to work when the weather was cold or hot, and even less willing to do heavy work. Wang Guohua, director of the Zhenzhou Agricultural Cooperative, and others believe that the kind of thinking and behavior of Liao Haiqing's family, which only cares about itself and not the whole, only cares about the present and not the future, is relatively common among farmers. They hoped that the newspaper would launch a debate on thrift and frugality during the rural socialist ideological education movement to reverse this unhealthy trend.

The New Hunan Daily published Wang Guohua and others' letter, along with an editor's note, calling on farmers throughout the province to participate in the discussion. Many county party committees issued notices requiring party committees at all levels to organize the masses to discuss the issue of thrift and frugality, making it an important part of the socialist debate. As a result, a heated debate unfolded widely in many agricultural cooperatives, production teams, and farm households, as well as among rural work cadres and the masses of farmers. In Ningxiang County alone, by the end of last November, more than 1,100 agricultural cooperatives had launched discussions. Nearly 150,000 farm households received education.

During the discussion, many people exposed phenomena similar to Liao Haiqing's lack of diligence and frugality, or diligence without frugality, in their own villages, cooperatives, and even families, and analyzed and criticized them. People pointed out that the growing extravagance and wastefulness in rural areas indicate that although the system of ownership has changed, many farmers' selfish and self-interested thinking has not changed. They believe that since they cannot buy land, acquire property, or lend money for interest, it is better to eat and wear the surplus money and grain. Many people lack a correct understanding of the relationship between the state, the cooperative, and the family. They believe that "I work and I earn, the more I earn, the more I spend, and no one can interfere"; and when they have difficulties in life, they simply rely on the cooperative and the government to solve them. Many people also lack a correct understanding of the relationship between current and long-term interests. They demand to improve their lives in one step, but neglect increasing accumulation and developing production.

Love the Country and the Collective First to Love the Family
The Interests of the Three are Inseparable

During the discussion, people cited a large number of facts to illustrate the consistency of the interests of the state, the cooperative, and the family, and to show that truly loving the family must first love the country and the collective. Li Xueliang, first secretary of the Ningxiang County Party Committee, said in an article that because many farmers have excessively high and urgent demands for improving their lives, using a large amount of staple food to feed pigs, brew wine, and boil sugar, and being extravagant in weddings and funerals, a man-made food shortage occurred in the county's rural areas last spring. Even the Weijiang Agricultural Cooperative, which had a bumper harvest the year before and had an average of more than 800 kilograms of grain per person, had to rely on the state to replenish grain. This forced the state to use a large amount of its grain reserves, wasting resources that could have been used to support the country's industrialization and develop agricultural production, causing losses to the country's construction and agricultural production; and the damage to agricultural production directly affected the income of the members. Wang Zhenghuai, director of the Wangyue Township Credit Cooperative in Wangcheng County, said that the year before last, Wangyue Township had a decent harvest, and farmers had a lot of idle funds, but because many farmers only cared about improving their lives and were unwilling to repay their loans, the credit cooperative had not recovered 32,200 yuan in living expenses loans, and only had 1,600 yuan in cash before spring plowing, which could not meet the needs of various agricultural cooperatives for production loans, which affected the production of agricultural cooperatives and also affected the income of members. Members of the Xianfeng Cooperative in Yueyang County made some statistics in the discussion. Due to eating, drinking, and wasting, some people lost money. When the cooperative started production in the spring, they focused on living, and half of the more than 8,000 yuan in agricultural loans the year before last were used by members to buy living materials, so that the cooperative's production could not develop faster. Extravagance and wastefulness cannot symbolize a good life.
Being Lazy and Gluttonous are Not "Smart"

During the discussion, people also sharply criticized the erroneous idea that extravagance and wastefulness are a normal phenomenon of improving living standards, and that lazy and gluttonous people are "smart" and that not spending money is "stupid." Ning Junxiu, director of the Longhe Township Women's Federation in Hengnan County, said at a forum: Today's life should be improved compared to the past, which is the purpose of the revolution and should be done, but we also want our future life to be better than today. If we all have the idea of using a penny when we have a penny, how will the good days of tomorrow come? When the third production team of the Paixing Agricultural Cooperative in Hanshou County debated, female member Peng Huaxiu compared her family's situation with that of her neighbor Qiu Li's family. Her family of nine only had one main labor force, but they never lost money and never went hungry, and the house was still neat and tidy. Qiu Li's family only had four people, two labor forces, and they were short of oil and rice all year round, and they even tore down the floorboards and wallboards in the house to sell for money. They had no rice for the Spring Festival the year before last and borrowed it from Peng Huaxiu's family. What is the reason? It's because Qiu Li is lazy and gluttonous, and only cares about the next meal when he has a meal, and gets drunk today and forgets tomorrow, while Peng Huaxiu's family is diligent and frugal. Peng Huaxiu asked: Who is harmed by extravagance and wastefulness, laziness and gluttony? Ding Enmin, the female vice director of the cooperative, also cited a fact: Last year, her family earned more than ten work points, which she gave to her mother to collect. Her mother had experienced a hard life and was reluctant to spend a penny randomly. After a long time, everyone forgot about it. Last year, her sister-in-law gave birth to a child and suddenly fell ill. The whole family was anxious because they had no money to hire a doctor, but her mother calmly took out more than a dozen new banknotes from the box, which solved the difficulty of seeing a doctor and taking medicine. People used these concrete and vivid facts to refute the erroneous argument that lazy and gluttonous people are "smart" and that diligence and thrift are "stupid."

Old and Young are Determined to be Diligent and Frugal
Everyone Saves Money to Accumulate Funds

After this great debate on thrift and frugality, which was conducted simultaneously in newspapers and in rural areas, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of farmers has been greatly enhanced. Some members of the Yueyang Xianfeng Cooperative proposed: "Love the country, the collective, and the family, and enjoy prosperity for generations." The cooperative's original autumn harvest distribution plan only allocated 2.8% to the public accumulation fund. After debate and discussion, it has now been increased to 8%. Originally, the cooperative wanted to retain 10,000 catties of reserve grain, and the members still had objections, but now they not only agreed, but each household is also preparing to store grain for disaster preparedness. After thousands of cooperatives in Ningxiang County launched discussions, members' attendance rate increased significantly, and investment increased rapidly. Some cooperatives have not only solved all the funds needed for winter production, but also stored funds for this year's production. Some members composed such folk songs: "The sun rises red and red, the Party's policy is really wise, calling on the people to be diligent and frugal, and socialism will be realized early; Diligent production brings more income, frugal accumulation makes life high, love the country, the collective, and the family, first of all, be diligent in work; Only diligence without frugality is like having a needle without thread, old and young are determined to be diligent and frugal, and rocks in the mountains will turn into gold; Everyone saves money to accumulate funds, support industry as heroes, the cooperative is rich and the country is strong, and thrift and frugality make the family happy for a long time."

The New Hunan Daily's discussion is still ongoing. The previous stage focused on discussing the issue of "frugality," and the next stage will focus on discussing the issue of "diligence."

    农民应当怎样过日子？
    新湖南报开展勤俭持家讨论收到很好效果
    本报讯　新湖南报从去年11月15日起，以“农民应当怎样过日子？”为题，开展了一次关于勤俭持家的讨论。这次讨论在广大农民中引起了热烈的反应，收到了很好的效果。
  从廖海清问题引起讨论
    彻底批判铺张浪费思想
    这次讨论是根据宁乡县珍洲农业社主任王国华和社员童志平等的建议开展的。他们在给新湖南报编辑部的一封信中，反映珍洲农业社社员廖海清家在收入增加后，好吃懒做，不勤不俭。廖海清家在解放前是一户贫民，土地改革中分得了土地、房屋和家具，当时他一家人都很勤劳，后来又参加了互助组、合作社，收入逐步增加。可是他家在收入大大增加以后，就忘记了“勤俭”二字，开始大吃大喝起来，有钱从不向合作社投资，也不肯向信用社存款。由于铺张浪费，有时还要向左邻右舍借钱用，并且欠了合作社的账。他家的劳动力对出工也很不积极，就连二十多岁、身强力壮的青年人，天冷天热都不肯出工，重活更不愿做。珍洲农业社主任王国华等认为，像廖海清家那种只顾自己不顾整体、只图眼前不管将来的思想和行为，在农民中是比较普遍的。他们希望报纸在农村社会主义思想教育运动中，开展一次勤俭持家的辩论，把这种不良风气扭转过来。
    新湖南报发表了王国华等的来信，并加编者按语，号召全省农民参加讨论。不少县委发出通知，要求各乡党委组织群众讨论勤俭持家问题，把它作为社会主义大辩论的一项重要内容。于是一场热烈的争辩，在许多农业社、生产队和农户中、在广大农村工作干部和农民群众中广泛展开。单是宁乡县，到去年11月底止，就有一千一百多个农业社开展了讨论。近十五万农户受到了教育。
    在讨论中，许多人揭发了本乡、本社乃至自己家庭中类似廖海清那样不勤不俭或勤而不俭的现象，并进行了分析批判。人们指出，目前农村中滋长着的铺张浪费现象，说明所有制虽然改变了，但是很多农民的自私自利思想还没有改变过来。他们看到现在不能买田置产放债，有余钱余粮不如吃到肚里、穿到身上。不少人对国家、合作社和家庭的关系缺乏正确的认识，他们认为“我劳我得，多得多用，花光用光，谁也管不着”；而当他们生活有困难的时候，又单纯依赖合作社和政府去解决。不少人对目前利益和长远利益的关系也缺乏正确的认识，他们在改善生活方面要求一步登天，对增加积累、发展生产却很忽视。
    爱家需先爱国爱社
    三者利益不可分割
    在讨论中人们列举大量事实，说明国家、合作社和家庭三者利益的一致，说明真正爱家必须首先爱国、爱社。宁乡县委第一书记李学良在一篇文章中说，由于不少农民对于改善生活要求过高过急，用大量主粮喂猪、煮酒、熬糖，做红白喜事时铺张浪费，使得全县农村去年春天出现了人为的粮食紧张局面。甚至像前年得到大丰收、每人平均留粮达八百多斤的沩江农业社，也要国家补销粮食。这样国家就不得不动用大量库存粮食，把本来可以用来支援国家工业化和发展农业生产的物资浪费了，给国家建设事业和农业生产带来了损失；而农业生产受到损失，又直接影响到社员的收入。望城县望岳乡信用社主任王正槐说，前年望岳乡的年成不坏，农民手中的闲散资金很多，但由于许多农民只顾改善生活，不肯归还贷款，信用社有三万二千多元生活贷款没有收回，春耕前库存现金只剩一千六百多元，不能满足各农业社生产贷款的需要，这就影响了农业社的生产，也影响了社员的收入。岳阳县先锋合作社社员在讨论中作了一点统计，由于吃喝浪费，有些人亏了账，到春上社里抓生产，他们却抓生活，前年八千多元的农贷便有一半支给社员买了生活资料，以致社里的生产不能更快地发展。大吃大喝不能象征生活好
  好吃懒做并非“聪明”人
    在讨论中，人们也尖锐地批判了那种认为大吃大喝是生活改善的正常现象，认为好吃懒做的人“聪明”、有钱不花是“蠢宝”的错误思想。衡南县龙鹤乡妇女主任宁俊秀在一次座谈会上说：今天的生活应当比过去改善，这是革命的目的，是应该的，但是我们还要今后的生活比今天更好呀，如果我们都抱着有一个钱用一个钱的想法，明天的好日子又怎么来呢？汉寿县排形农业社第三生产队辩论时，女社员彭花秀以自家的情况同邻居丘立三的情况作了对比。她家九口人吃饭，只有一个主要劳动力，可是年年没亏账，也没有饿过肚皮，屋里还是搞得熨熨贴贴。丘立三家只有四口人，两个劳动力，一年四季不是缺油就是少米，把屋里的楼板、板壁都拆着卖花了，前年过年没有米，还是向彭花秀家借的。原因是什么呢？就因为丘立三好吃懒做，有了钱上餐不顾下餐，今日有酒今日醉，而彭花秀家却做到了勤快、节省。彭花秀问道：大吃大喝、好吃懒做究竟害了谁呢？这个社的女副社长丁恩民也举出了一个事实：去年她家进了十多块工分钱，交给她母亲收起。她母亲经历过艰苦生活，一分钱都舍不得乱用。以后日子久了，大家都忘记了这件事。去年她嫂子生小孩，突然得病，一家都因为没钱请医生而焦急，她母亲却很沉着地从箱子里拿出十几张新钞票，解决了看病吃药的困难。人们用这些具体生动的事实，把那种认为好吃懒做的人“聪明”、克勤克俭是“蠢宝”的错误论调驳得体无完肤。
    老少勤俭有决心
      人人节约积资金
    经过报纸上和农村中同时进行的这一场勤俭持家的大辩论，广大农民的社会主义觉悟大大提高。岳阳先锋社有的社员提出：“爱国爱社又爱家，子子孙孙享荣华”。这个社原来的秋收分配方案，公积金只有2.8％，经过争辩和讨论，现在提高到8％。原来社里要留一万斤储备粮，社员还有意见，现在不但同意了，各户并且准备储粮备荒。宁乡县成千的合作社开展讨论后，社员们出勤率大大提高，投资迅速增加，有的社不仅冬季生产所需资金已全部解决，还为今年的生产储备了资金。社员中有人编起了这样的歌谣：“太阳出来红又红，党的政策真英明，号召人民搞勤俭，社会主义早实现；勤劳生产收入多，节俭积累生活高，爱国爱社爱家庭，首先就要出工勤；单有勤来没有俭，好像有针没有线，老少勤俭有决心，山里岩石变成金；人人节约积资金，支援工业当英雄，社里富裕国家强，勤俭持家幸福长。”
    新湖南报的这个讨论目前还在继续进行。前一阶段着重讨论的是“俭”的问题，今后将着重讨论“勤”的问题。
