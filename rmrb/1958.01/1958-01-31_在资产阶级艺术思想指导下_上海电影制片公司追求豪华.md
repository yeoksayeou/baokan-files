Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 30th. Shanghai Film Studio employees recently, in a special anti-waste forum, examined and exposed a large number of wasteful phenomena in various aspects of the company. In the past five years alone, the backlog and waste of blindly purchased machinery and equipment, and the waste in temporary wages, film stock, scenery, costumes, etc. in 1957, amounted to about 2.3 million yuan, which could have been used to shoot ten to twelve films, equivalent to more than half of all films produced in 1957.

Among the waste phenomena that have been revealed, the most shocking is the waste caused by the guidance of bourgeois artistic thought in the film production process. Disregarding the plot and characters, blindly pursuing and flaunting the luxury of scenery, props, and costumes not only wasted a large amount of state resources, but also damaged the plot and reduced the artistic quality of the films. One film cost more than 9,000 yuan to shoot rural exterior scenes indoors. Another film spent more than 3,000 yuan to build a ballroom, but the dancing scenes shot were cut because they did not fit the plot. In the film "Deep Affection," the building where the scientists lived cost 6,000 yuan for the set, but only two shots were taken, while in real life only the wealthiest capitalists would live in such a house. In one costume drama, a moat was built using 2,000 man-days and costing 15,000 yuan, but it was hardly visible in the film later. Some sets were too large and elaborate, and it was impossible to capture the full view, so special close-up shots had to be taken specifically for the sets.

Some people satirized certain films as costume exhibitions. In one film, a nurse who was determined to serve at the most arduous construction site changed into twenty-four elaborate outfits. One film depicted the first group of female navigators trained in New China, and the clothing costs for just three female navigators amounted to nearly 1,000 yuan. In one costume drama, the costumes were made of the finest brocade, but because the material was too good, it made noise when walking, making it impossible to shoot, so they had to be remade.

The extravagance and waste formed by the bourgeois artistic thought in Shanghai Film Studio also exposed the company's chaotic and unsound planning management.

### 在资产阶级艺术思想指导下  上海电影制片公司追求豪华

    在资产阶级艺术思想指导下
    上海电影制片公司追求豪华
    据新华社上海30日电　上海电影制片公司的职工最近在反浪费专题鸣放中，检查揭发出公司在各方面的大量浪费现象。仅五年来因盲目购置机器设备的积压浪费和1957年在临时工资、胶片、布景、服装等方面的浪费部分，就达二百三十万元左右，可以拍摄十部到十二部影片，相当于1957年摄制的全部影片的一半以上。
    在揭发的浪费现象中，最使人们震惊的，是在影片生产过程中由于资产阶级艺术思想的指导所造成的浪费。不顾剧情、人物，盲目地追求和卖弄布景、道具、服装的豪华，不但浪费了国家大量资财，也伤害了剧情，降低了影片的艺术质量。有部影片因硬要在室内拍摄农村外景，耗费了九千多元。另一部影片曾花三千多元搭一个舞厅，结果，所拍的跳舞镜头因不合剧情而被剪掉。影片“情长谊深”中科学家住的楼房，布景用了六千元，只拍了两个镜头，而现实生活中只有最阔气的资本家才会住这样的房子。有一部古装片中有一条护城河，是用了两千个人工、耗费了一万五千元修的，但后来在影片中却不大看得见。有的布景太大、太讲究，根本拍不到全貌，不得不专为了布景拍些特写镜头。
    有人讽刺某些影片像服装展览会。某影片中一个坚决到最艰苦的建筑工地去服务的女护士，前后竟换了二十四套讲究的衣服。某影片表现新中国培养的第一批女领航员，仅三个女领航员的服装费就用了将近一千元。有一部古装片，服装选了最好的锦缎做，结果因为质料太好了，走起路来有响声，没法拍戏，只得重做。
    上影资产阶级艺术思想形成的铺张浪费，同时暴露出公司计划管理的混乱和不健全。
