Small Information

    How much did the area of improved crop varieties expand during the First Five-Year Plan?
    In 1952, the area planted with improved varieties of major crops such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds was only over 120 million mu. By 1957, it had expanded to over 1.26 billion mu, an increase of more than nine times. Breaking down by crop: rice expanded from 22.86 million mu in 1952 to 322.89 million mu in 1957, an increase of thirteen times; wheat expanded from 18.82 million mu in 1952 to 315.14 million mu in 1957, an increase of more than fifteen times; coarse grains expanded from 37.58 million mu in 1952 to 318.43 million mu in 1957, an increase of 7.4 times; tuber crops expanded from 580,000 mu in 1952 to 91.48 million mu in 1957, an increase of 156.7 times (1957 figures do not include oilseed crops); cotton expanded from 41.8 million mu in 1952 to 81.57 million mu in 1957, an increase of approximately one time.
    By 1957, the area planted with improved cotton varieties accounted for approximately 95% of the sown area, basically meeting the requirements for popularization. Last year, the area planted with improved wheat varieties already accounted for 75.3% of the sown area.
    Currently, there are over 770 improved varieties of 18 major crops such as rice being promoted for production nationwide. These improved varieties have played a significant role in increasing production in vast areas. The Nantao No. 1 rice, which is widespread in the Yangtze River basin and parts of South China, generally yields over 500 jin per mu, an increase of 10%-30% compared to local varieties in many areas. The unit yield of Bima No. 1 wheat, which has been promoted on over 35 million mu, is about 20% higher than local varieties in many areas. The improved cotton variety Dai Zi No. 15 is now the main variety in the cotton-growing areas of the Yangtze River basin. Dai Zi No. 15 generally yields 150 to 250 jin of seed cotton per mu, higher than other varieties.

    第一个五年计划期间农作物优良品种面积扩大了多少？
    1952年粮、棉、油料等主要作物良种面积只有一亿二千多万亩，1957年扩大到十二亿六千多万亩，增加了九倍以上。各种作物分开来说：水稻由1952年的二千二百八十六万亩，扩大到1957年三万二千二百八十九万亩，增加十三倍；小麦由1952年一千八百八十二万亩，扩大到1957年三万一千五百一十四万亩，增加十五倍多；杂粮由1952年三千七百五十八万亩，扩大到1957年三万一千八百四十三万亩，增加七点四倍；薯类作物由1952年的五十八万亩，扩大到1957年的九千一百四十八万亩，增加一百五十六点七倍（1957年不包括油料作物）；棉花由1952年的四千一百八十万亩，扩大到1957年的八千一百五十七万亩，约增加一倍。
    1957年棉花良种面积已占播种面积的95％左右，基本上达到了普及的要求。小麦良种面积在去年已占到播种面积的75.3％。
    目前在全国生产上推广的水稻等十八种主要作物的优良品种有七百七十多种。这些优良品种已在广大地区起了显著的增产作用。遍及长江流域和华南部分地区的南特号水稻，一般亩产五百斤以上，比许多地区的当地种增产10％—30％。推广了三千五百多万亩的碧玛一号小麦的单位产量，在许多地区都比当地种高20％左右。棉花良种岱字十五号，现在已是长江流域棉区的主要品种。岱字十五号一般亩产籽棉一百五十斤到二百五十斤，高于其他品种。
