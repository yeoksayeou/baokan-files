Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. Shanghai has begun to relocate some poorly equipped factories that breed flies, such as ranches and pig bristle and sausage casing factories, from the urban area to the suburbs, and is improving equipment to control the reproduction and growth of flies.

Shanghai currently has more than 300 factories and workshops that breed flies, most of which are joint state-private small and medium-sized enterprises, scattered in various districts of the city. These places are swarming with flies and reek, seriously harming the environmental hygiene of the surrounding residents. Relevant professional companies in various industries have conducted investigations for this purpose and have made a decision to relocate to the suburbs. The waste products company has now established a working group to prepare to relocate more than 100 hair and bone workshops and grease workshops under its jurisdiction to the northern suburbs during the Spring Festival and the second quarter. The four production cooperatives and cooperative groups affiliated with the Leather United Cooperative are building houses in the suburbs and will soon be able to move out of the urban area. The Animal Products Export Company has allocated special funds for the relocation of some sausage casing and pig bristle workshops.

All units relocating to the suburbs will improve storage equipment and operating methods to effectively prevent the breeding of flies. Hair and bone workshops and pig bristle workshops will improve drying grounds and build maggot-trapping ditches around the grounds to eliminate flies in their larval stage.

    上海孳生苍蝇厂坊外迁  改良设备控制苍蝇繁殖
    据新华社上海7日电　上海市开始着手把一些设备简陋孳生苍蝇的牧场，猪鬃、肠衣工厂等从市区迁往郊区，并改良设备，控制苍蝇的繁殖和生长。
    上海现有孳生苍蝇的工厂、作坊三百多处，大部分是公私合营的中小企业，分散在市内各区。这些地方苍蝇成群，恶味熏人，严重妨害周围居民的环境卫生。各行业的有关专业公司为此曾经进行调查，并且作出迁移郊区的决定。废品公司现在已成立工作组，准备分别在春节和第二季度内，把所属的一百多户毛骨作、油脂作迁往北郊。皮革联社所属的四个生产合作社和合作小组正在郊区盖房，不久就可以迁出市区。畜产出口公司已经给部分肠衣、猪鬃作坊拨出迁移专款。
    迁往郊区的各单位都将改进储藏设备和操作方法，有效地制止苍蝇的孳生。毛骨作、猪鬃作都要改良晒场，并且在场地四周筑捕蛆沟，使苍蝇在幼虫时代就被消灭。
