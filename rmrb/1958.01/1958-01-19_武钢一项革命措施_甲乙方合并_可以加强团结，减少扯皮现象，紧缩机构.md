    Wuhan Iron and Steel's Revolutionary Measure: Merging Party A and Party B
    Can Strengthen Unity, Reduce Wrangling, and Streamline Institutions
    (Our Newspaper News) The Wuhan Iron and Steel (Group) Corporation (WISCO) and Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation Party Committees recently proposed a revolutionary plan to reform the basic construction system of WISCO: merge WISCO and Wuhan Metallurgical Construction General Company. This facilitates mobilizing all positive factors, strengthening unity, and reducing wrangling, to adapt to the characteristics of this year's large tasks, tight deadlines, and the start of large-scale equipment installation, and to create favorable conditions for ensuring that No. 1 Blast Furnace is put into production by the end of the year and to comprehensively complete the task of building the WISCO plant.
    After the merger of WISCO and Wuhan Construction Company, the institutions will be greatly streamlined, and the number of departments will be reduced by half. The existing more than 10,000 cadres will be reduced to 5,000, and the leadership structure of the general company will be reduced from more than 2,000 to within 1,000.

    武钢一项革命措施——甲乙方合并
    可以加强团结，减少扯皮现象，紧缩机构
    本报讯　武钢、武汉冶金建筑公司党委最近提出了一个改革武钢基本建设体制的革命性的方案：合并武汉钢铁公司和武汉冶金建筑总公司。这样便于调动一切积极因素，加强团结，减少扯皮现象，以适应今年任务大、工期紧和开始大规模设备安装的施工特点，为确保一号高炉年底投入生产和全面完成武钢建厂任务创造有利条件。
    武钢、武建公司合并以后，机构将大大紧缩，处室将减少一半。现有的一万多名干部将减少到五千人，总公司的领导机构将由二千多人减少到一千人以内。
