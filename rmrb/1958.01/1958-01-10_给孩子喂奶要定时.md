    Feeding the baby should be on a schedule

    Comrade Wen Min,

    Your letter to the People's Daily was forwarded to me. I am very happy to know that you are about to become a mother! Now, let me answer your question about feeding times.

    The old lady next door told you: there is no need to schedule feeding; just feed him when he cries. Although this method can avoid the baby from crying, it is unscientific. Because the baby needs a certain amount of time to digest after feeding. If he eats again while the previous milk is still in his stomach, it is easy to cause indigestion. You should know that a baby's crying is not always due to hunger. A wet diaper or discomfort in a certain part of the body can also cause a baby to cry.

    Feeding should be on a schedule. Feeding every three to four hours gives the baby a certain amount of time to digest; for the mother, scheduled stimulation of the breasts will increase milk production. If you feed the baby every time he cries, he will gradually develop bad habits, and the amount of breast milk secreted will decrease.

    So, how many hours should there be between feedings? After the baby is full, it takes about three to four hours to digest. Human milk digests faster, about three hours; cow's milk digests slower, about four hours. Therefore, the feeding time should generally be spaced three to four hours apart. However, the feeding time is also related to the age and health of the baby. A full-term infant can be fed seven times a day within two to three months after birth. Feed every three hours during the day, and the interval can be longer at night, allowing both mother and child to have a longer period of quiet sleep. After three months, the daytime can be extended to three and a half to four hours for each feeding, and the number of feedings can be reduced to six times a day. After six to seven months, the daily feedings can be reduced to five times, and there is no need to feed at night. Babies with weaker bodies eat less at each feeding, and the number of feedings should be relatively increased. In the first two to three months after birth, they can be fed eight times a day. If some babies have a good appetite and suckle strongly, and can sleep continuously for more than three hours between two feedings, then six feedings a day is sufficient. Feeding the baby should be on a schedule, but don't be too rigid. You said you want to buy an "alarm" clock to wake you up on time to feed the baby, which is unnecessary. If the baby is asleep, there is no need to wake him up; it doesn't matter if you extend the feeding time a little.

    You asked how to arrange feeding times after going to work. If your workplace is far from home, it is best to reduce one breast milk feeding in the morning or afternoon and replace it with milk or a milk substitute. If your working hours are from 7:00 to 12:00 in the morning and 2:00 to 5:00 in the afternoon, then your feeding times can be around 6:00 and 10:00 in the morning, and 1:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon; replace the 10:00 am feeding with milk or other milk substitutes. I wish you all the best!

### 给孩子喂奶要定时

    给孩子喂奶要定时文敏同志
    你给人民日报的信转给我了。知道你快要作妈妈了，我真为你高兴！现在我就回答你提出的关于喂奶时间的问题吧。
    邻居老太太告诉你：喂奶不用定时，哭了就给他吃。这办法虽然可以避免小孩哭闹，但是不科学。因为小孩吃完奶，需要一定的消化时间，如果头一次的奶还在胃里又接着吃，就容易引起不消化。要知道，小孩哭，有时并不是肚饿。尿布湿了，或身体某一部分不舒服，都会使小孩啼哭。
    喂奶要定时。每隔三、四小时喂一次奶，对孩子来说，有一定的消化时间；对母亲来说，定时刺激乳房，母奶分泌就会增加。如果孩子一哭就喂奶，慢慢地会养成孩子不好的习惯；母奶分泌量便会减少。
    那么，间隔几小时喂一次奶呢？孩子吃饱之后，约需三、四小时才能消化完。人奶消化较快，约三小时；牛奶消化较慢，约四小时。所以喂奶时间一般应间隔三至四小时。不过，喂奶时间和小孩年龄的大小、身体健康情况也有关系。足月生产的婴儿，生后二、三个月内，一天喂奶七次就可以了。白天每三小时喂奶一次，夜间可以隔得长一些，让母子都有较长时间的安静睡眠。三个月后，白天可延长至三个半小时至四小时喂奶一次，喂奶次数可减至每天六次。六至七个月以后，每日喂奶可减至五次，夜间可不喂奶。身体较弱的孩子，每次吃奶量较少，喂奶次数应相对地增多，在生后头两三个月内，一天可以喂奶八次。如果有的孩子胃口很好，吸奶力强，两次喂奶之间能连续睡眠三小时以上，那么每日喂六次奶就可以了。给孩子喂奶要定时，但也不要过分死板。你说要买一个“闹”钟，以便准时叫醒你去喂奶，这是不必要的。如果孩子睡着了，不用叫醒他，延长一些时间喂奶没关系。
    你问上班后怎样安排喂奶时间，如果你上班的地方离家较远，最好在上午或下午少喂一次母奶，用牛奶或代乳品代替。假如你上班的时间是上午七至十二，下午二至五，那么你的喂奶时间可以在上午六点多和十点多，下午一点多和五点多；上午十点多的一次奶用牛奶或其他代乳品代替。预祝你一切顺利！
