    In order to coordinate with the development of mountain areas, Wushan County, Gansu Province, is actively preparing for the construction of small-scale factories and mines and handicraft processing plants by relying on the masses and utilizing local materials. These factories and mines include small-scale indigenous iron smelting plants, small-scale coal mines, bacterial fertilizer plants, granular fertilizer plants, as well as processing plants for forestry by-products, flax, leather, and meat products, totaling thirty-one.

    These factories and mines are run in four ways: by cooperatives themselves, jointly by handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives, jointly by supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives, and jointly by supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives. They will all be completed and put into production this year.

    After exploration, the raw materials needed are found to be distributed in large quantities within Wushan County, sufficient for use.

    开发山区就地取材
    为了配合开发山区，甘肃省武山县依靠群众、就地取材，积极筹建小型厂矿和手工业加工厂。这些厂矿包括小型土法炼铁厂、小型煤矿、细菌肥料厂、颗粒肥料厂，以及林副业产品、亚麻、皮革、肉品加工厂等共三十一个。
    这些厂矿分合作社自办，手工业社和农业社合办，供销社和农业社合办，供销社和手工业社合办四种。它们都将在今年建成投入生产。
    所需要的原料，经过勘察，在武山县境内大量分布着，足够使用。　　　　（新华社）
