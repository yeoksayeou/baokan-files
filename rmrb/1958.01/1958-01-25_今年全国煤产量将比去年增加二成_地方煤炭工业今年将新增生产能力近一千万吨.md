Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: After three rounds of research and revisions, the Ministry of Coal Industry has formulated a relatively advanced production plan for 1958. This year, state-owned coal mines will produce 106 million tons of raw coal, an increase of nearly 20% compared to last year's state plan, and a 12.8% increase compared to last year's actual raw coal production.

    Compared to the initial proposed figure, this plan has increased by a total of 6 million tons of raw coal.

    The Ministry of Coal Industry's production plan for this year was determined under the impetus of the high production enthusiasm of the masses after the nationwide rectification campaign. In August of last year, in order to arrange this year's production as early as possible, the ministry proposed a suggested figure of 100 million tons of raw coal for the national state-owned coal mines in 1958, based on the production situation in the first half of the year and the progress of capital construction at that time. This suggestion was a 13% increase over the planned output for 1957. However, when the various regional administrations compiled draft plans for 1958 based on this suggestion, the raw coal output stipulated in the draft plans increased by 920,000 tons compared to the ministry's suggestion. Subsequently, as the rectification movement deepened and the production enthusiasm of coal miners in various regions continued to increase, the average daily output of national state-owned coal mines in the fourth quarter of last year increased by 18.9% compared to the average daily output in the first half of the year, the attendance rate increased by more than 2.5%, and the progress of capital construction also greatly accelerated. Therefore, when the Ministry of Coal Industry officially issued the 1958 plan in mid-December last year, it raised this year's raw coal output to 104 million tons, an increase of 3.08 million tons compared to the draft plans formulated by the various administrations. However, after this plan was disseminated to the various mines for nearly a month of discussion among the workers and masses, it was greatly increased again. Therefore, with the approval of the State Economic Commission, and with the addition of some investment, equipment, materials, and personnel, the Ministry of Coal Industry once again added to the production plan for state-owned coal mines this year, based on the requests of the various mines.

    Currently, the discussion of the national plan by coal mine workers in various regions has not yet fully concluded. It is estimated that the plans stipulated will likely be overfulfilled under the guidance of the general policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and under the impetus of the mass production upsurge.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: This year, the local coal mining industry across the country will see significant development.

    According to the plans formulated by various provinces, the total raw coal output of local state-owned, joint state-private, cooperative-run coal mines, as well as small kilns using manual mining, will reach 44.5 million tons this year, an increase of more than 26% compared to the actual raw coal production last year, accounting for approximately 30% of the national coal production plan for this year.

    This year, the state's investment in local coal mines has increased by nearly 100% compared to last year. A total of 147 new, renovated, and restored mine shafts across the country will begin construction this year. The production capacity of these mine shafts is equivalent to more than half of the total production capacity of the mine shafts that began construction during the First Five-Year Plan. At the same time, local coal mines in various provinces also have mine shafts with a total production capacity of 9.91 million tons that will be put into production successively this year.

    This year's development plan for local coal mines in various provinces was formulated after fully estimating the positive factors in all aspects. Due to the construction during the First Five-Year Plan, local coal mines in various provinces have gained relatively rich experience in geology, design, construction, and production. There is also a further understanding of the resource conditions suitable for the development of local coal mines than in the past. In particular, since various regions have vigorously developed small coal kilns in accordance with the instructions of the State Council, a new force has been added to local coal mines. Last year, the coal produced by various provinces using small coal kilns reached 6.17 million tons, and it is planned to increase this to 7.92 million tons this year.

    Due to the development of local coal mines, the civilian coal for rural areas and small and medium-sized cities in various provinces, as well as the coal for local industry and handicrafts, has begun to gradually develop towards self-sufficiency. This year, the industrial, transportation, and civilian coal in five provinces and autonomous regions, including Hunan, Shanxi, Yunnan, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, will be entirely supplied by local coal mines in their respective regions. Among them, Hunan and Shanxi provinces will not only be self-sufficient but also be able to transport some coal to support other provinces. It is expected that by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the coal produced in Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Inner Mongolia will also achieve self-sufficiency. In this way, state-owned coal mines can concentrate their main forces to meet the coal needs of important industries and large cities.

### 今年全国煤产量将比去年增加二成  地方煤炭工业今年将新增生产能力近一千万吨

    今年全国煤产量将比去年增加二成
    地方煤炭工业今年将新增生产能力近一千万吨
    据新华社23日讯　煤炭工业部经过三次研究和修改以后，已经制定出比较先进的1958年度生产计划。今年国营煤矿的原煤产量将达一亿零六百万吨，比去年的国家计划增产将近20％，比去年实际完成的原煤产量增长12.8％。
    这个计划如果同第一次提出的建议数字比较，共计增加了六百万吨原煤。
    煤炭工业部今年的生产计划是在全民整风以后，群众高涨的生产热情推动下确定的。去年8月，这个部为了及早安排今年的生产，曾根据上半年的生产情况和当时规定的基本建设的进度，提出了1958年全国国营煤矿生产原煤一亿吨的建议数字。这个建议比1957年计划产量增长13％。可是当各地区管理局根据这个建议编制成1958年计划草案后，草案中规定的原煤产量就比部的建议增加了九十二万吨。接着，由于整风运动深入展开，各地煤矿工人的生产积极性不断提高，去年第四季度全国国营煤矿的平均日产量比上半年平均日产量增加了18.9％，出勤率提高了2.5％以上，基本建设的进度也大大加快。因此，煤炭工业部在去年12月中旬正式下达1958年度计划时，便把今年原煤产量提高到了一亿零四百万吨，比各管理局制定的计划草案增加了三百零八万吨。可是这个计划下达到各矿经过职工群众将近一个月的讨论以后，又大大增加了。因此，煤炭工业部根据各矿要求，并报请国家经济委员会同意以后，在增加一部分投资、设备、材料和人员的情况下，又一次追加了今年国营煤矿的生产计划。
    现在，各地煤矿职工讨论国家计划还没有完全结束，估计各矿在全面贯彻多、快、好、省的方针和在群众生产高潮的推动下，规定的计划是可能超额完成的。
    据新华社23日讯　今年全国地方煤矿工业将有很大发展。
    根据各省制订的计划，今年地方国营、公私合营、合作社营煤矿以及手工开采的小窑煤，总计原煤产量将达四千四五百万吨，比去年实际生产的原煤增加26％以上，约占今年全国煤炭计划产量的30％。
    今年国家对地方煤矿的投资比去年增加了将近一倍，全国总计有一百四十七对新建、改建和恢复矿井将在今年动工建设。这些矿井的生产能力，相当于第一个五年计划期间开工兴建的矿井的全部生产能力一半以上。同时，各省的地方煤矿还有总生产能力九百九十一万吨的矿井将在今年陆续投入生产。
    今年各省地方煤矿发展计划是在充分估计了各方面的积极因素以后制定的。由于经过第一个五年计划的建设，各省的地方煤矿不论在地质、设计、施工和生产等方面，都已经取得了比较丰富的经验，适宜于发展地方煤矿的资源情况也比过去有了进一步的了解。特别是各地根据国务院指示大力发展小煤窑以后，更为地方煤矿增加了一支生力军。去年各省利用小煤窑生产的煤炭就达六百一十七万吨，计划今年还将提高到七百九十二万吨。
    由于地方煤矿的发展，各省的农村及中小城市的民用煤以及地方工业和手工业用煤，已开始逐步向自给自足的方向发展。今年全国就有湖南、山西、云南、新疆、青海等五个省和自治区的工业、交通和民用煤，将全部由本地区的地方煤矿供给，其中，湖南、山西两省除了自给以外，还能外运一部分煤炭支援其他省份。预计到第二个五年计划末期，河南、安徽、江西和内蒙古等地方生产的煤炭，也将达到自给自足。这样，就能使国营煤矿集中主要力量，满足重要工业和大城市的用煤需要。
