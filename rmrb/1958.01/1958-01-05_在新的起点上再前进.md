    Advancing Again from a New Starting Point
    Lin Jiang
    In the rectification campaign, the vast numbers of teachers and students in national institutions of higher learning, on the basis of raising their socialist consciousness, have begun to establish a new style of study and a new atmosphere has emerged that is unprecedented. This is something to be welcomed.
    We see that many intellectuals have put down their airs, participated in physical labor, and are determined to become working-class intellectuals. This is a great revolution in thought and a great initiative in Chinese history. We also see that the spirit of hard work and plain living is taking shape, and the spirit of running schools diligently and thriftily and building the country diligently and thriftily is being promoted. We also see that the vast numbers of teachers, students, and staff members are speaking out freely, feeling relieved, and creating a situation with both democracy and centralism, both discipline and freedom.
    The socialist new style of study that is currently beginning to be established in national institutions of higher learning is a revolutionary and good new trend, and a powerful guarantee for running socialist universities well. Although the new style of study that has emerged is only a beginning, we should cherish it, consolidate it, and continue to promote it. At present, many schools have not paid enough attention to the newly emerging style of study. Although some schools have carried out education on running schools diligently and thriftily, loving labor, and observing discipline, ideological and political work has not been done in depth. We should recognize that establishing a new style of study is actually a series of ideological and political education work, and also a struggle on the ideological and political fronts. In the process of establishing a new style of study, it is necessary to thoroughly criticize the old capitalist style of study, clarify thinking through debate, and let uprightness rise and evil decline. Only on the basis of constantly raising ideological awareness can the socialist new style of study that has already emerged be well and permanently consolidated and implemented.
    We have a new and progressive starting point. We must advance again from this starting point!

    在新的起点上再前进
    临江
    在整风运动中，全国高等学校广大师生，在提高社会主义觉悟的基础上，开始树立了新学风，出现了前所未有的新气象。这是值得欢迎的事情。
    我们看到，许多知识分子放下了架子，参加体力劳动，决心做工人阶级知识分子。这是思想上的大革命，也是中国历史上的伟大创举。我们也看到，艰苦朴素的风气正在形成，勤俭办学、勤俭建国的精神正在发扬。我们也看到，广大师生员工大鸣大放，胸怀舒畅，既有民主又有集中，既有纪律又有自由的局面。
    目前全国高等学校开始树立起来的这种社会主义的新学风，是一种革命的良好的新风气，是办好社会主义大学的有力保证。虽然，目前出现的这种新学风还仅仅是一个开始。但是，我们应该珍重它，巩固它，并且继续加以发扬。现在，有不少学校还没有很好重视刚开始出现的新学风。有些学校虽然开展了勤俭办学、热爱劳动、遵守纪律的教育，但是思想政治工作还做得不深入。我们应该认识到，树立新学风，实际上也正是一系列的思想政治教育工作，也是一场思想战线上和政治战线上的斗争。在树立新学风的过程中，必须彻底批判旧的资本主义的学风，经过辩论，澄清思想，使正气上升，邪气低头。只有在不断提高思想觉悟的基础上，才能使已经出现的社会主义新学风很好地长期地巩固下来，贯彻下去。
    我们有了一个新的进步的起点。我们要在这个起点上再前进！
