    Dishonesty is Unacceptable
    Zhao Qi
    While agricultural cooperatives across the country are working vigorously to increase production by accumulating fertilizer, some production units are engaging in dishonesty by "moving yellow earth." In the "August 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in the Shijingshan District of Beijing's suburbs, the fertilizer accumulated by the Heishitou and Tongjafen production teams contains a considerable proportion of turf, river ditch sand, and yellow earth from cemeteries, which have little or no fertilizing effect. In order to achieve the target of "10,000 jin of fertilizer" per mu, the Heishitou team organized eleven members to carry soil to the fields for more than ten days.
    Fertilizer is an important measure to ensure increased agricultural production. Increasing the unit area yield of crops largely depends on fertilizer. If the accumulated fertilizer is some sand or yellow earth, then the meaning of accumulating fertilizer is completely lost, and it becomes a waste of labor. "People deceive the land, and the land deceives the belly" (agricultural proverb). Aren't those who use yellow earth to pretend to be fertilizer afraid that their bellies will be deceived by the land?
    Why is this happening? According to Yang Jinshan, the production team leader of Tongjafen, the reason is that there is a shortage of labor, poor conditions for accumulating fertilizer, and difficulty in completing the task. Is it difficult to accumulate fertilizer? Of course, it is. But the correct attitude should be to muster the courage to overcome difficulties, rather than being dishonest and deceiving oneself. The Liyuantou Township Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Tianjin did not have enough livestock, so the members used manpower to transport miscellaneous fertilizer from the city. Some members of Yangchang Township got up at five o'clock every day and went to the Jin-Tang Highway, three miles away, to pick up manure because there were not many local fertilizer sources. Agricultural cooperatives that have difficulty accumulating fertilizer should learn from their fighting spirit to overcome difficulties.
    Some time ago, many regions conducted debates on issues such as whether or not to accumulate fertilizer and whether or not it was possible to accumulate fertilizer. As a result of the debates, the correct answers were found, and the fertilizer accumulation work was promoted. Regions that find that the quality of fertilizer accumulation is not good can also launch a discussion on the question of whether or not to be dishonest. After discussion, the masses' understanding and awareness will be improved, and the phenomenon of not paying attention to quality can also be eliminated.

    弄虚作假要不得
    赵起
    在各地农业合作社轰轰烈烈为增产而努力积肥的同时，有一些生产单位却在用“黄土搬家”的办法弄虚作假。北京市郊石景山区“八一”农业社的黑石头、佟家坟两个生产队所积的肥料，有相当大的比重是没有肥效或肥效极少的草皮土、河沟沙土和坟地上的黄土。黑石头队为了达到每亩“万斤肥”的指标，曾经组织十一个社员往地里抬了十几天土。
    肥料是保证农业增产的重要措施。提高农作物单位面积产量在很大程度上要依靠肥料。如果所积的肥料是一些沙土、黄土，这就完全失去了积肥的意义，成了劳动力的浪费。“人哄地皮，地哄肚皮”（农谚），用黄土冒充肥料的人，难道肚皮不怕被地皮哄弄吗？
    为什么会发生这样的事情呢？据佟家坟生产队长杨金山说，原因是劳力少，积肥条件差，完成任务有困难。积肥是不是有困难呢？当然有。但正确的态度应当是鼓起勇气去克服困难，而不是弄虚作假，自己骗自己。天津郊区梨园头乡农业社畜力不够，社员们就用人力运回市内的杂肥。杨场乡有些社员因为当地肥源不多，就每天五点起床，到三里以外的津塘公路上去拾粪。积肥有困难的社，应当学习他们这种克服困难的战斗精神。
    前些时，许多地区在该不该积肥、能不能积肥等问题上都开展过辩论。辩论的结果，找出了正确的答案，推动了积肥工作。发现积肥质量不好的地区，也可以就该不该弄虚作假的问题展开一个讨论。经过讨论，群众的认识和觉悟提高了，不注意质量的现象也可以消除了。
