Xinhua News Agency report: The West German public continues to oppose the Adenauer government's insistence on establishing an atomic arsenal.

    The West German Peace Committee issued a statement demanding that the West German government agree to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. The statement opposed turning West Germany into a base for rockets and atomic weapons and opposed equipping the West German army with atomic weapons.

    The German Democratic Women's League held a conference in West Berlin with the participation of more than 300 women from all walks of life. The conference adopted a letter to various women's organizations in Berlin, calling on all women's organizations to cooperate in the struggle against arming West Germany with atomic weapons, demanding that the West German government and the Federal Parliament carefully study the Soviet government's proposals, and promote the achievement of a disarmament agreement.

    West German atomic scientist, Professor of Mainz University, and Social Democratic Party member of the Federal Parliament, Bechert, issued a statement on the 15th, protesting the establishment of rocket bases on West German territory and demanding negotiations on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Bechert called on all university teachers in West Germany to sign his statement. He also called on the people of Germany to support his protest.

    Prominent West German atomic scientists opposed to atomic armament held a meeting in Bad Godesberg on the 13th. Participants included signatories of the famous "Göttingen Declaration." Professor Hahn, a world-renowned scientist, emphasized at the meeting that the eighteen scientists who signed the "Göttingen Declaration" intended to protest the West German atomic armament policy again.

    The West German Trade Union Federation, with more than six million members, opposes the West German government's policy of forcing people to tighten their belts for military expansion. The chairman of this largest trade union organization in West Germany, Richter, said in a radio speech, "Erhard (West German Minister of Economic Affairs) wants workers to work harder to provide for West German armaments. The union firmly opposes this demand. The Trade Union Federation condemns the policy of continued armament."

    "Neue Rhein Zeitung" reported that the West German Social Democratic Party press office also issued a statement on Erhard's demands, stating: "In the Hitler era, the authorities called on residents to work an hour or two more to rearm. Now Erhard has issued such a call for the same reason."

    Many West German newspapers on the 16th expressed dissatisfaction with Adenauer's rejection in a radio speech the day before of the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. "Westdeutsche Rundschau" said: "Adenauer poured cold water on the public." Many newspapers also pointed out that Adenauer's speech showed that the West German government had no intention of changing its consistent policy of strength towards the Soviet Union.

    西德公众不跟阿登纳走向绝路
    坚决反对原子军备政策
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：西德公众继续反对阿登纳政府坚持建立原子军备的政策。
    西德和平委员会发表了声明，要求西德政府同意在中欧建立无原子武器区。声明反对使西德变成火箭和原子武器基地，反对用原子武器装备西德军队。
    德国民主妇女联合会在西柏林举行了有各界妇女三百多人参加的大会。大会通过了告柏林各妇女团体书，号召各妇女团体在反对用原子武器武装西德的斗争中进行合作，要求西德政府和联邦议院仔细研究苏联政府的建议，并且促使达成裁军协议。
    西德原子科学家、美因兹大学教授、联邦议院社会民主党议员贝歇尔特15日发表声明，抗议在西德领土上建立火箭基地，并且要求就建立无原子武器区问题进行谈判。贝歇尔特号召西德所有高等学校教师在他的声明上签字。他还号召德国全国人民支持他的抗议。
    反对原子武装的西德著名原子科学家13日在巴特格德斯堡举行会议。参加会议的有著名的“戈丁根宣言”的签名者。世界著名的科学家哈恩教授在会上强调指出，在“戈丁根宣言”上签名的十八名科学家打算再次抗议西德的原子武装政策。
    拥有六百多万会员的西德工会联合会反对西德政府要人民勒紧肚带进行扩军的政策。这个西德最大的工会组织的主席里希特在广播演说中说，“艾哈德（西德经济部长）想要职工们付出更多的劳动来供西德武装之用。工会坚决反对这个要求。工会联合会谴责继续武装的政策。”
    “新莱因报”报道，西德社会民主党新闻处也就艾哈德的要求发表声明，声明指出：“在希特勒时代，当局曾经号召居民为了重整军备而多做一两个小时的工。现在艾哈德也根据同样的理由发出了这样的号召。”
    西德许多报纸16日都对阿登纳前一天在广播演说中拒绝关于在欧洲中部建立无原子武器区的建议表示不满。“西德汇报”说：“阿登纳对公众泼了冷水”。还有许多报纸指出，阿登纳的演说表明，西德政府无意改变它一贯采取的针对苏联的实力政策。
