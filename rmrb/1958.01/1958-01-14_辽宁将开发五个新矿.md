Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 12th: Five new mining areas in Liaoning Province, namely Nanpiao, Qinghemen, Tie (ling) Fa (ku), and Yuanbaoshan and Pingzhuang, which are located between Liaoning and Inner Mongolia, will soon be developed.

It has now been proven that these five new mining areas have abundant coal reserves. The Yuanbaoshan mining area has coal reserves of 430 million tons, the Pingzhuang mining area has coal reserves of 260 million tons, and the Nanpiao mining area also has coal reserves of 180 million tons. The Tie (ling) Fa (ku) mining area, which is still being explored, is a promising new coalfield. A large coalfield of 500 square kilometers has been discovered on the west bank of the Liao River alone. The quality of the coal in these mining areas is very good. The lignite in the Yuanbaoshan and Pingzhuang mining areas can be used for civilian use, power generation, and possibly for oil refining. The coal in the other mining areas is industrial coal with a very high calorific value.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, approximately twenty new mines and open-pit mines are expected to be built in these five new mining areas, with a designed capacity of more than 9 million tons. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, more than 3.8 million tons of production capacity will be put into operation.

    辽宁将开发五个新矿
    据新华社沈阳12日电　辽宁省境内的南票、清河门、铁（岭）法（库）和介于辽宁、内蒙古之间的元宝山、平庄等五个新矿区，即将开发。
    现在已经探明，这五个新矿区有着丰富的煤藏量。元宝山矿区储煤达四亿三千万吨，平庄矿区储煤二亿六千万吨，南票矿区也有一亿八千万吨的储煤量。正在继续勘探的铁（岭）法（库）矿区是希望很大的新煤田，仅在辽河西岸就发现了五百平方公里的大片煤田。这些矿区煤的质量很好。元宝山、平庄矿区的褐煤可供民用、发电，并有可能用来炼油。其余几个矿区的煤都是发热量很高的工业用煤。
    第二个五年计划期内，在这五个新矿区预计将建设新矿井和露天矿约二十个，设计能力九百万吨以上；第二个五年计划末期将有三百八十多万吨的生产能力投入生产。
