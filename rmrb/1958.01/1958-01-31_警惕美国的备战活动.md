Beware of U.S. War Preparations
By our commentator

    The U.S. military command in Korea has openly admitted that the United States has shipped 280mm atomic cannons and "Honest John" rockets capable of launching atomic warheads into South Korea. This is a continuation of a series of criminal acts by the United States to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, and it shows that the United States is stepping up its atomic war preparations in the Far East.

    In June of last year, after the United States unilaterally tore up the clause in the Korean Armistice Agreement that prohibited the introduction of reinforcing weapons into Korea, it immediately shipped new combat aircraft into South Korea and subsequently reorganized the two U.S. divisions in South Korea into "pentomic atomic divisions." General White, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Army Forces, even declared that these two divisions would be fully equipped with atomic weapons. Recently, in order to inspect the "nuclear strike capabilities" of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee forces, the U.S.-Rhee forces conducted the largest atomic "sortie" exercise near the military demarcation line since the armistice. After inspecting this exercise, General Decker, commander of the U.S. forces in Korea, and Syngman Rhee, the puppet president of South Korea, clamored to intensify nuclear war training, and the U.S. atomic cannons were shipped into South Korea during this exercise. At the same time, many facts show that the U.S. plan to turn South Korea into a missile base is also underway. Syngman Rhee recently clamored that for South Korea, "it is not a question of accepting missiles, but a question of quickly transporting missiles." U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy also testified at a closed session of the U.S. House of Representatives that the Department of Defense is considering establishing intermediate-range missile bases in the Far East. Obviously, this series of actions by the United States to create a war threat is part of the U.S. "overall Cold War" and its entire atomic war preparation policy. This action by the United States, as well as its intensified plans to establish missile bases in Western Europe and the Middle East, and its demand that the people at home tighten their belts and have "more guns, less butter," have fully exposed to the peace-loving people of the world what kind of window dressing Eisenhower's "peace work" in his State of the Union address is.

    Now, people all over the world are demanding that a summit conference be held between Eastern and Western countries to achieve disarmament, cessation of testing and use of nuclear weapons, and relaxation of international tensions; people of all countries are enthusiastically responding to and supporting the Soviet Union's proposal to establish nuclear-free zones in Central Europe and the Middle East. However, the U.S. government is shipping atomic weapons into South Korea, stepping up atomic war preparations in South Korea, and planning to establish intermediate-range missile bases in the Far East. This crazy warmongering action is not only a provocation against the Korean and Chinese people, but also a threat to peace in the Far East and the world. The people of Asia and the world must always be vigilant against the warmongers. As for the Korean and Chinese people, who have already defeated U.S. imperialism, although they have always been working hard to make the Korean armistice a solid and lasting peace and striving for a peaceful settlement of the Korean question, they have not been afraid of war provocations and threats in the past, and they will not be afraid in the future. The U.S. ruling clique needs to calmly consider: Should it take the path of easing international tensions? Or should it lead the world to the disaster of atomic-rocket war and reap the consequences?

    警惕美国的备战活动
    本报评论员
    侵朝美军司令部已经公开承认，美国已把口径二百八十毫米的原子炮和能够发射原子弹头的“诚实的约翰”式火箭运进南朝鲜。这是美国破坏朝鲜停战协定的一系列罪恶行为的延续，它说明美国在远东地区进行原子备战的活动越来越加紧了。
    去年6月，美国片面撕毁朝鲜停战协定中关于不得以增援性武器运入朝鲜的条款以后，马上就把新式作战飞机运进了南朝鲜，随后又把在南朝鲜的两师美军改编为“五单位制原子师”。美国太平洋陆军部队总司令怀特并曾宣称，这两师军队将全部配备原子武器。最近，为检查美国和李承晚军队的“核攻击力量”，美李军队又在军事停战线附近举行了一场停战以来规模最大的原子“出击”演习。侵朝美军司令德克尔和南朝鲜傀儡总统李承晚在参观这场演习之后，都曾大肆叫嚷要加紧进行核战争的训练，而美国的原子炮就是在这次演习期间运进南朝鲜的。同时，有许多事实表明，美国把南朝鲜变为导弹基地的计划也正在进行。李承晚最近曾公然叫嚣说，对于南朝鲜来说，“不是接受导弹的问题，而是把导弹迅速运到”的问题。而美国国防部长麦克艾罗伊在美国众议院一次秘密会议上作证的时候也说过，国防部正在考虑在远东设置中程导弹基地。很明显，美国的这一系列制造战争威胁的行动，是美国“总体冷战”和它的整个原子备战政策的一环。美国的这种行动，以及它加紧策划在西欧、中东建立导弹基地，要求国内人民勒紧裤带，“多些大炮，少些牛油”的政策，在世界爱好和平人民面前，已经充分暴露了艾森豪威尔在国情咨文里所说的“和平工作”是怎样一种挂羊头卖狗肉的烟幕。
    现在全世界人民要求举行东西方国家最高级会议，来实现裁减军备、停止试验和使用核武器、缓和国际紧张局势；各国人民热烈响应和拥护苏联关于建立中欧和中东无原子地区的主张，而美国政府竟把原子武器运进南朝鲜，加紧在南朝鲜进行原子备战活动，并且要在远东地区建立中程导弹基地。这种疯狂的好战行动，不仅是对朝鲜和中国人民的挑衅，也是对远东和世界和平的威胁。亚洲和全世界的人民，要时刻保持对战争狂人的警惕。至于已经打败过美帝国主义的朝中人民，虽则一贯在努力使朝鲜停战成为巩固持久的和平，努力争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，但是，对于战争挑衅和威胁恫吓，过去没有害怕过，今后也不会害怕。美国统治集团需要冷静考虑一下：究竟是走缓和国际紧张局势的道路呢？还是把世界导向原子—火箭战争的灾难而自食其果呢？
