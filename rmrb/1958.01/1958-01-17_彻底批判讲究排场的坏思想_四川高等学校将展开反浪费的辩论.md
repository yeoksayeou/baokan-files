Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 16th: Sichuan's twenty-three institutions of higher learning have recently studied the issue of implementing the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily, believing that it is necessary to mobilize the masses, oppose waste, and establish a revolutionary approach to running schools.

According to the reports of the presidents and deans, the phenomenon of bloated institutions, excessive layers, and overstaffing is common in various schools. The ratio of faculty and staff to students in many schools far exceeds the indicators stipulated by the Ministry of Higher Education. For example, the ratio of faculty and staff to students at the Sichuan Institute of Finance and Economics is one to two point six seven, and the salaries of faculty and staff account for about 45% of the institute's total annual expenditure. Of the institute's more than 40,000 square meters of housing, faculty and staff occupy nearly half. Some teachers only teach two hours of class per week and still complain about being busy. According to the plans of various schools, generally about 30% of faculty and staff can be streamlined and transferred to lower levels, and Sichuan Institute of Finance and Economics and Sichuan Agricultural College can reach 39%. Sichuan University recently transferred more than 250 faculty and staff, and the school's work has not been affected. Many presidents and deans suggest that the Ministry of Higher Education restore the teacher workload system and stipulate personnel establishment ratios based on the different nature of the schools.

In terms of teaching equipment such as instruments and books, the phenomenon of stockpiling and waste is also quite serious. According to the inspection of Chengdu Institute of Technology, Sichuan Normal College, and other three colleges alone, the stockpiled and wasted equipment amounts to more than 410,000 yuan. Some schools even buy instruments without understanding their performance and use, and have to send people to other places to learn how to use them. Many expensive instruments cannot be used after they are bought. Among the more than 260,000 books in Chongqing University, more than 100,000 have been stockpiled in the library. Sichuan University subscribes to more than 1,000 kinds of newspapers and periodicals from capitalist countries, but few people read them. There are also many wasteful and unreasonable phenomena in basic construction, employee welfare, and people's student aid.

The presidents and deans believe that implementing the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily can not only save the country a lot of manpower, material resources, and construction funds, but also is related to the correct implementation of the socialist education policy of institutions of higher learning. This situation of excessive personnel and extravagance not only fosters the ideological style of some teachers being divorced from reality and the masses, but also has a negative impact on students. Many students in schools have also developed a mentality of dependence, even unwilling to provide their own textbooks, and demand that the state take care of everything. The presidents and deans believe that only by implementing the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily and thoroughly reversing this unhealthy trend can we cultivate national construction talents with a spirit of hard work and simplicity and socialist consciousness.

The presidents and deans believe that it is necessary to vigorously mobilize faculty, staff, and students in the current rectification campaign to seriously expose all undesirable phenomena that violate the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily, launch in-depth debates, and thoroughly criticize the bourgeois ideological styles of blindly pursuing modernization, ostentation, and extravagance, in order to establish a revolutionary style of running schools characterized by hard work and simplicity in institutions of higher learning.

### 彻底批判讲究排场的坏思想  四川高等学校将展开反浪费的辩论

    彻底批判讲究排场的坏思想
    四川高等学校将展开反浪费的辩论
    据新华社成都16日电　四川二十三所高等学校的校院长最近研究了贯彻勤俭办学方针问题，认为必须发动群众，反对浪费，树立起用革命办法办学的风气。
    据校院长们反映，各校普遍存在机构庞大、层次过多、人浮于事的现象。许多学校教职工人数和学生人数之间的比例都大大超过高等教育部规定的指标。例如四川财经学院教职工同学生的比例是一比二点六七，教职工的工资约占全院全年经费总数45％。全院四万多平方公尺的住房，教职员占用将近一半。有的教师每周仅教两小时的课，还叫喊忙碌。根据各校计划，一般可以紧缩和下放教职工30％左右，四川财经学院和四川农学院可以达到39％。四川大学在最近下放了二百五十多名教职员，学校工作并未受到影响。许多校院长建议高等教育部恢复教师工作量制度，并根据不同性质的学校规定人员编制比例。
    仪器、图书等教学设备方面，积压、浪费现象也相当严重。仅据成都工学院、四川师范学院等三个学院检查，积压和浪费的设备就在四十一万元以上。有的学校甚至连仪器的性能和用途都不了解就买回来，使用时还得派人到外地学习。不少贵重仪器买回来后无法用。重庆大学二十六万多册图书中，有十多万册一直积压在图书馆里。四川大学订阅的资本主义国家报刊有一千多种，很少有人翻阅。其他在基本建设方面，职工福利和人民助学金等方面也有许多浪费和不合理现象。
    校院长们认为，贯彻勤俭办学方针不仅能为国家节约大量人力、物力和建设资金，而且关系着高等学校的社会主义教育方针的正确贯彻。这种人员过多和铺张浪费情况，不仅助长了一些教师脱离实际、脱离群众的思想作风，而且对学生也有不良影响。许多学校的学生还滋长了依赖思想，连教科书也不愿自备，要求国家包干。校院长们认为，只有贯彻勤俭办学方针，彻底扭转这种不良风气，才能培养出具有艰苦朴素作风和社会主义觉悟的国家建设人才。
    校院长们认为，必须在当前整改中，大力发动教职员工和学生认真揭发一切违反勤俭办学方针的不良现象，深入展开辩论，彻底批判盲目追求现代化、讲排场、讲阔气等资产阶级思想作风，才能在高等学校中树立起艰苦朴素的革命的办学风气。
