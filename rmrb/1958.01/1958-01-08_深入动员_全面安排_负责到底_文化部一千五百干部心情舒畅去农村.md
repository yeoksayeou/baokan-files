Following in-depth mobilization, comprehensive arrangements, and a commitment to being responsible to the end, the first group of over 1,500 cadres from units under the Ministry of Culture have, as of January 6th, departed in batches to the countryside in Hebei and Jiangsu provinces for labor training. Vice Ministers of Culture Zhang Zhixiang and Chen Kehan personally saw these cadres off to the countryside.

After the list of cadres assigned to the countryside was announced on the honor roll, the masses were very excited, spreading the news. The cadres who were approved to go to the countryside were filled with joy, and countless letters of determination and gratitude once again guaranteed to the Party that after arriving in the countryside, they would overcome all difficulties and respond to the Party's cultivation and expectations with practical actions. Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing and Vice Minister Qian Junrui wrote letters congratulating these cadres on being honorably approved to go to the countryside for labor training. Minister Shen Yanbing wrote in his letter: "I hope you cherish this opportunity for training: you must be able to endure hardship and work hard; put down the airs of a cadre, take farmers as teachers, and learn from them diligently, so as to train yourselves into good cadres who are both red and expert." Minister Shen Yanbing and several vice ministers also attended farewell meetings of many units and spoke to the cadres going to the countryside.

Among the cadres participating in agricultural labor in the countryside, there are 66 cadres at or above the division level, 280 cadres at the section level, and Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members account for 54%, with 57% having a high school to university education level. Among the cadres going to the countryside are Assistant Minister of Culture Huang Luofeng, Deputy Director of the General Office Wang You Tang, Deputy Director of the Film Bureau Gao Ge, Deputy Director of the Publishing Bureau Bu Ming, Director of the Beijing Film Studio Wang Yang, and woodcut artist Gu Yuan. The cadres going to the countryside are divided into seven large teams, led by twenty-one division, bureau, and section-level cadres, and will go to the plains or mountainous rural areas of seven counties in the Tangshan Prefecture of Hebei Province and the Yangzhou Prefecture of Jiangsu Province. In addition to receiving training themselves, these cadres also have the task of helping agricultural production cooperatives to carry out mass cultural work.

In order to be responsible for these cadres to the end, the Ministry of Culture has also selected a group of division-level and above cadres with grassroots work experience and strong political capabilities to work in the county party committees or district party committees of the above-mentioned seven counties, responsible for conducting political and ideological education for the cadres going to the countryside. The Cadre Department of the Ministry of Culture and the personnel departments of each unit also have dedicated personnel responsible for the liaison work of the cadres going to the countryside, and to understand and solve some of the difficult problems of the families of the cadres going to the countryside.

After full discussion and debate by the leading cadres of the units under the Ministry of Culture, and repeated clarification by the leaders of the Ministry on the significance of labor training for cadres, they overcame the ideas of "getting rid of burdens" and "keeping the strong and leaving the weak." In accordance with the principle of "unified arrangement and comprehensive training," each unit made preliminary plans, selected a group of good cadres to go to the countryside for labor training on the basis of voluntary registration by the masses, and equipped them with strong backbones who had undergone training. The Ministry of Culture and the various business bureaus also studied the issue of cultural and artistic business cadres participating in labor training, believing that cultural and artistic business cadres should in principle participate in labor training, and at the same time, various methods of participating in physical labor should be adopted in accordance with the characteristics of various artistic businesses and the specific circumstances of various personnel. The Ministry of Culture is formulating a plan for various types of artistic personnel to participate in labor training, which will be issued to various artistic business departments for reference after discussion and research by relevant parties.

Many units of the Ministry of Culture fully mobilized the masses to raise questions, present difficulties, and talk about their thoughts. Based on the questions raised by everyone, they gathered together to launch a great debate and conducted in-depth ideological education work for the cadres going to the countryside. At the group meetings, the masses also conducted realistic discussions based on the specific circumstances of the cadres required to go to the countryside (such as the cadres' understanding of going to the countryside, work arrangements, ideological situation, physical conditions, family situation, etc.). Some units also invited comrades who had improved their understanding after undergoing self-ideological struggle to speak from their own experiences. These reports were very enlightening to everyone. Some units also selected various representative thoughts and launched mass discussions. Through this kind of discussion and debate, many cadres clarified the Party's cadre line, the necessary path of ideological remolding for intellectuals, and the great significance of this cadre assignment to the countryside. They realized that participating in physical labor in the countryside and integrating with the working people is an effective measure for ideological remolding of intellectuals; after labor training, intellectuals can remold their ideology well, stand firm on the position of the working class, so that their business work has a solid political foundation, and their business skills can be rapidly improved, and they can become cultural cadres who are both red and expert and strive for communism. At the group meetings, the masses also discussed the difficulties of the cadres going to the countryside and put forward various solutions. Some people proposed organizing mutual aid groups to take care of the children of the cadres going to the countryside, some volunteered to take the children of the cadres going to the countryside into their own homes, and some gave cloth coupons to the cadres going to the countryside to make cotton clothes. Through the mutual assistance of the masses, some practical difficulties of the cadres going to the countryside were solved.

Before this group of cadres left for the countryside, they also studied relevant documents on rural work and agricultural production, discussed the "Pledge of Cadres Sent to the Countryside," and the leading comrades of each unit also talked to them individually, soliciting their opinions, and the cadres who remained in the office also expressed that they must take on the work left by the cadres going to the countryside very well.

    深入动员  全面安排  负责到底
    文化部一千五百干部心情舒畅去农村
    本报讯　文化部所属各单位第一批下放的一千五百多名干部，到6日为止，陆续出发到河北和江苏的农村去劳动锻炼。文化部副部长张致祥、陈克寒亲自送这批下放干部下乡。
    光荣榜上公布了下放干部的名单以后，群众十分兴奋，大家奔走相告；被批准下放的干部都喜气洋溢，无数决心书和感谢信再次向党保证，到农村以后，他们将克服一切困难，用实际行动回答党对他们的培养和期望。文化部部长沈雁冰、副部长钱俊瑞写信祝贺这批干部光荣地被批准下放到农村去劳动锻炼。沈雁冰部长的信上写道：“我希望你们珍视这次锻炼的机会：要吃得苦、耐得劳；放下干部的架子，拜农民做老师，好好地向他们学习，把自己锻炼成一个又红又专的好干部。”沈雁冰部长和几位副部长还分别参加了许多单位的话别会，向下放干部讲了话。
    这批去农村参加农业劳动的干部中，有处级以上干部六十六人，科级干部二百八十人，共产党员和共青团员占54％，具有高中到大学毕业文化水平的占57％。下放干部中，有文化部部长助理黄洛峰，办公厅副主任王友唐，电影局副局长高戈，出版局副局长卜明，北京电影制片厂厂长汪洋，木刻家古元等。下放干部分七个大队，由二十一个司、局、处级干部带领，分别到河北省唐山专区和江苏省扬州专区七个县的平原或山区农村去。这批下放干部除了自己接受锻炼外，还负有帮助农业生产合作社开展群众文化工作的任务。
    为了对这批下放干部负责到底，文化部还选派一批有基层工作经验和政治上比较强的处级以上干部到上述七个县的中共县委会或中共区委会去工作，负责对下放干部进行政治思想教育工作。文化部干部司和各单位的人事部门也都设有专人负责下放干部的联系工作，并且了解和解决下放干部家属中的一些困难问题。
    文化部所属各单位的领导干部经过充分讨论争辩，和部的领导上对于下放干部劳动锻炼的意义的反复阐明，克服了“甩包袱”、“去弱留强”思想。各单位按照“统一安排，全面锻炼”的方针，作了初步规划，在群众自愿报名的基础上选调一批好干部到农村去劳动锻炼，并且配备了经过锻炼的强的骨干。文化部和各业务局还研究了关于文化艺术业务干部参加劳动锻炼的问题，认为文化艺术业务干部原则上都必须进行劳动锻炼，同时要按照各种艺术业务的特点和各类人员的具体情况，采取多种多样的参加体力劳动的办法。文化部正在制订各类艺术人员参加劳动锻炼的方案，经有关方面研究讨论后，将发给各艺术业务部门参考。
    文化部许多单位以充分发动群众提问题、摆困难、谈思想，根据大家所提出的问题，集中起来展开大辩论，对下放干部进行了深入的思想教育工作。小组会上，群众还根据要求下放干部的具体情况（如对干部下放的认识、工作的安排、思想情况、身体条件、家庭情况，等等）进行实事求是的讨论。有些单位还请一些经过自我思想斗争最后提高了认识的同志，现身说法。这些报告对大家有很大启发。有些单位还选择各种有代表性的思想，展开群众性的讨论。经过这种讨论和争辩，许多干部明确了党的干部路线、知识分子思想改造的必经道路和这次干部下放的重大意义。他们认识到下乡参加体力劳动，与劳动人民相结合是对知识分子进行思想改造的一项有效措施；知识分子经过劳动锻炼，把思想改造好，站稳工人阶级的立场，使业务工作有了坚实的政治基础，业务才能迅速提高，他们才能成为一个为共产主义奋斗的又红又专的文化干部。小组会上，群众也讨论了下放干部的困难问题，提出了各种解决办法，有人提出组织互助组照顾下放干部的孩子，有人自愿把下放干部的孩子领到自己家里，有人把布票送给下放干部做棉衣。通过群众的互助，下放干部的一些实际困难问题得到了解决。
    这批下放干部临走以前又学习了有关农村工作和农业生产的文件，讨论了“下放农村干部公约”，各单位的领导同志又一一分别找他们谈话，征求他们的意见，留在机关工作的干部也表示一定要把下放干部留下来的工作很好地担负起来。
