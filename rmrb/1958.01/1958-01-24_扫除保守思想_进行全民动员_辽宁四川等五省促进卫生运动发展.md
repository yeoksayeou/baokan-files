Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Liaoning, Shandong, Henan, Zhejiang, Sichuan and other five provinces are actively sweeping away conservative thinking, carrying out nationwide mobilization, and promoting the patriotic health campaign with the elimination of the "Four Pests" as its central content.

    The Liaoning Provincial People's Committee passed a resolution on the 21st, stating that it will become a "Four-Without" province within five years. The resolution called on the people of the province to muster revolutionary vigor, take the lead, and immediately launch a patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the "Four Pests" throughout the province, and to conduct commendations and criticisms in a timely manner to promote the leaping development of the campaign. Since 1952, Liaoning Province has launched a vigorous patriotic health campaign, which played a significant role in opposing the bacteriological warfare waged by American imperialism at that time. In the past two years, it has also eliminated a large number of "Four Pests" and created large areas of basically rat-free, sparrow-free, mosquito-free, and fly-free zones.

    Shandong Province held a provincial mobilization rally for eliminating the "Four Pests" and promoting hygiene on the evening of the 20th, which was broadcast live to more than one million people in various regions. Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, issued a battle call to the people of the province at the meeting. He asked the party, government, army, and people of the province to mobilize, march on the Four Pests, march on all unhygienic dead corners, and strive to basically turn Shandong Province into a "Four-Without" province ahead of schedule during the second five-year plan period. Shu Tong called for criticizing conservative thinking, clearing obstacles to the development of the hygiene campaign, and called on the province to create batches of "Four-Without" factories, "Four-Without" schools, "Four-Without" streets, "Four-Without" companies, "Four-Without" organs, and "Four-Without" townships and communities this year. Wang Tao, Deputy County Head of Yangxin County, a model county in Shandong Province's patriotic health campaign, said at the meeting that Yangxin County had decided to basically eliminate the Four Pests this year, one year ahead of schedule.

    A total of 20,000 people from all walks of life in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and representatives from advanced health counties and cities in various prefectures, held a mobilization rally for eliminating the "Four Pests" on the 23rd. Yang Jue, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on the entire party and all the people to mobilize, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking with a revolutionary optimistic spirit, and strive to make Henan Province a "Four-Without" province within six or seven years. Wang Junzhi, Mayor of Zhengzhou City, proposed on behalf of the 500,000 residents of Zhengzhou that Zhengzhou should become a "Five-Without" city (without flies, mosquitoes, rats, sparrows, and bedbugs) before the "May Day" holiday this year. Representatives from Dengfeng County, which has eliminated the Four Pests in 76 villages and achieved regular cleanliness in more than 70% of the villages, guaranteed that it would become a Four-Without county this year.

    The first Zhejiang Provincial Congress of Activists for Eliminating the "Four Pests" and Preventing Schistosomiasis was held in Nanxun Town, Wuxing County, a famous fly-free town, from the 15th to the 22nd. Huo Shilian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Governor of Zhejiang Province, announced at the meeting that Zhejiang Province would strive to basically eliminate the "Four Pests" and become a "Four-Without" province in about seven years, and that schistosomiasis, which seriously threatens people's health, must be eliminated within five years. Huo Shilian called on leading cadres of all counties and cities to create a "Four-Without" or "Five-Without" (plus snails) base point in 1958, and to promote it in a timely manner, from point to area, so that the movement would continue to expand and deepen. Huo Shilian said that the Provincial Party Committee had decided that, starting this year, it would hold two provincial congresses of activists and two provincial congresses of cadres every year in places where the work of eliminating the Four Pests and preventing schistosomiasis was done well, to inspect this work. Many units attending the meeting examined conservative thinking and revised their original plans. Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and other seven cities decided to eliminate the "Four Pests" or "Five Pests" in one to two years, respectively.

    The Sichuan Provincial People's Committee, the leading organs of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Chengdu, and the Chengdu Municipal People's Committee jointly convened a cadre meeting of 1,600 people on the 18th to criticize conservative thinking in the work of eliminating the "Four Pests" and mobilize a new upsurge in eliminating the "Four Pests" throughout the province. Li Dazhang, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Sichuan Province, pointed out at the meeting that the current movement to eliminate the "Four Pests" in Sichuan Province is clearly insufficient, whether from the perspective of the great leap in industrial and agricultural production, or in comparison with the movement to eliminate the "Four Pests" in some provinces. At present, the province has not yet formed a vigorous, mass-based upsurge of eliminating the "Four Pests" in which everyone participates. Li Dazhang asked everyone to first overcome their own ideological conservatism and backwardness, and take the most effective measures to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses to do a good job in the patriotic health campaign, and thoroughly eliminate the Four Pests. Ye Shi, Deputy Mayor of Chengdu, proposed a plan for Chengdu to completely eliminate the "Seven Pests" (rats, sparrows, flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, bedbugs, and snails) within three years.

    扫除保守思想　进行全民动员
    辽宁四川等五省促进卫生运动发展
    据新华社讯　辽宁、山东、河南、浙江、四川等五省，积极扫除保守思想，进行全民动员，推进以除四害为中心内容的爱国卫生运动。
    辽宁省人民委员会21日通过决议，要在五年内成为“四无”省。决议号召全省人民鼓起革命干劲，领导带头，立即在全省展开以除“四害”为中心的爱国卫生运动，并且要及时进行表扬与批评，以促进运动的飞跃发展。辽宁省自1952年起，曾掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的爱国卫生运动，对反对当时美国帝国主义进行细菌战起了很大作用。最近两年来，也消灭了大量的“四害”，创造了大片的基本无鼠、无雀、无蚊、无蝇地区。
    山东省20日晚举行全省除四害、讲卫生誓师广播大会，各地一百多万人收听了大会的实况广播。中共山东省委第一书记、山东省爱国卫生运动委员会主任委员舒同在会上向全省人民发出战斗号召。他要求全省党政军民动员起来，向四害进军，向一切不卫生的死角进军，争取提前在第二个五年计划期内把山东省基本上变成“四无”省。舒同号召批判保守思想，扫清开展卫生运动的障碍，并号召全省今年创造出成批的四无厂、四无学校、四无街道、四无连队、四无机关和四无乡、社。山东省爱国卫生运动模范县阳信县的副县长王涛在会上说，阳信县决定提前一年在今年基本上消灭四害。
    河南省郑州市各界人民和各专区卫生先进县市代表共两万人，23日举行了除四害的誓师大会。中共河南省委书记处书记杨珏在会上号召全党、全民动员起来，用革命的乐观主义精神克服右倾保守思想，争取六、七年内使河南省成为四无省。郑州市市长王均智代表郑州市五十万居民提出今年“五一”节前郑州要成为无蝇、无蚊、无鼠、无雀、无臭虫的“五无”城市。已经在七十六个村庄消灭了四害，70％以上的村庄作到了经常整洁的登封县的代表，保证今年成为四无县。
    浙江省第一次除四害、防治血吸虫病积极分子大会15日到22日在著名的无蝇镇——吴兴县南浔镇举行。中共浙江省委书记处书记、浙江省副省长霍士廉在会上宣布：浙江省争取在七年左右的时间内基本上消灭“四害”，成为“四无省”，严重威胁人民健康的血吸虫病必须在五年内消灭。霍士廉号召各县市的领导干部都要在1958年内创造一个“四无”或“五无”（加钉螺）的基点，及时推广，由点到面，使运动不断扩大深入。霍士廉说，省委决定从今年起每年在除四害和防治血吸虫病工作作得好的地方召开两次全省性的积极分子大会和两次全省性的干部大会，检查这项工作。到会的不少单位检查了保守思想，修订了原有的计划。杭州、温州、宁波等七个城市决定分别在一年到二年内消灭“四害”或“五害”。
    四川省人民委员会、人民解放军驻成都部队领导机关、成都市人民委员会18日联合召开了一千六百人的干部会议，批判除四害工作中的保守思想，动员在全省掀起一个除四害的新高潮。中共四川省委书记、四川省省长李大章在会上指出，目前四川省的除四害运动，无论从工农业生产的大跃进来讲，或者同有些省的除四害运动比较，显然还动得不够。现在全省还没有形成一个轰轰烈烈的、人人动手的群众性的除四害高潮。李大章要求大家首先克服自己思想上的保守落后状态，并采取最有效的办法，依靠群众，发动群众起来搞好爱国卫生运动，彻底消灭四害。成都市副市长叶石提出成都市三年内全部消灭“七害”（老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子、蟑螂、臭虫、钉螺）的规划。
