    The people of Shanxi Province are launching a new high tide in the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests with overwhelming force. Many basic four-pest-free villages and model hygiene villages are bringing out the revolutionary drive of socialism, taking the hygiene movement a step forward; many backward villages are also catching up at a rapid pace, becoming advanced villages. What a gratifying phenomenon!
    Amidst the chorus of victory reports, one situation deserves our attention, and that is that some advanced villages that have basically eliminated the four pests have begun to show a sign of relaxation. Some people say that the four pests have been almost eliminated, and a dozen or so sparrows and mice left are nothing to worry about. Naturally, this kind of thinking is not right.
    The patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests needs to be launched with a concentrated effort in a certain period, but undoubtedly it should be regularized, just as we cannot do without hygiene for a day. Advanced villages that have basically eliminated the four pests must regularize the movement after the concentrated high tide has passed. The remaining four pests will not make peace with the people; if you do not make a determined effort to completely wipe them out, it will not be long before they will unceremoniously breed and attack you from all sides. If you give up on the four pests, the four pests will not give up on you. Therefore, we should muster our strength, press home the victory, and completely wipe out the four pests. Besides, there are bound to be many loopholes in the work of advanced villages! This makes it even more impossible for us to be complacent.

    乘胜追击
    幼琴
    山西省人民正以排山倒海之势，把除四害、讲卫生运动推向新的高潮。许许多多基本四无村、卫生模范村拿出社会主义的革命干劲，使卫生运动向前跃进一步；不少落后村，也正以急速的步伐赶上去，成为先进村。这是多么可喜的现象！
    在一片报捷声中，有一种情况值得我们注意，这就是，有些基本上消灭了四害的先进村，开始流露出一种松劲情绪。有人说，四害消灭得差不多了，留下十几只麻雀、老鼠算不得什么。自然，这种思想是不对劲的。
    除四害、讲卫生运动在某一个时期是需要展开突击的，但是，无疑的它应当经常化起来，正如我们不能一天不讲卫生一样。已经基本上消灭了四害的先进村，在突击性的高潮过去以后，还必须使运动经常化。残余的四害是不会同人们休战的，如果你不下死劲去彻底歼灭它们，不要多久，它们就会毫不客气地繁殖起来。从各方面向你进攻。你对四害罢休，四害却不会对你罢休。所以，我们应该鼓足劲头，乘胜追击，把四害全歼。何况，先进村的工作中不免还有不少漏洞呢！这就更不允许我们自满了。
