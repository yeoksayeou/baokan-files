    The Impact of American Lifestyle on Japan
    By Nan Bo, Japanese Commentator

    Post-war Japan, along with social and political changes, has undergone profound cultural transformations. This change is primarily reflected in the impact of the American occupation policy on the cultural life of the Japanese people during the American occupation.

    In order to Americanize Japanese culture, the American occupation forces carried out control in two aspects. One aspect was the various restrictions imposed on freedom of speech and expression, which was a passive policy. The other, more important aspect was the penetration of American culture into Japan, which was an active policy.

    For example, in the publishing sector, during the period when paper distribution was implemented after the war and the publishing industry faced difficulties, the Japanese version of the American magazine "Reader's Digest" received special permission from the American occupation forces and became the publication with the largest circulation. In June 1949, its circulation reached 1.5 million copies. This was because the magazine was intended to be a tool for instilling American ideas and lifestyles into the Japanese people and spreading anti-communist and anti-socialist rhetoric. Although the circulation of this magazine has now decreased to about 400,000 copies, it has undoubtedly had the greatest influence in making the Japanese people accept American culture over the past decade.

    In the broadcasting sector, shortly after Japan's surrender, most of the broadcasting programs of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) were controlled by the Broadcasting Management Section of the Education and Information Bureau of the American occupation forces. Most of the NHK employees who opposed the American policy were dismissed.

    Currently, the influence of American culture is not mainly penetrating the lives of the Japanese people through broadcasting, but mainly through television. It is most convenient to incorporate American television films into Japanese television programs without any changes, as it does not cost money and there are no technical difficulties. Therefore, NHK and two private television broadcasting stations in Tokyo now broadcast as many as seventeen American television films a week. This means that more than two American Westerns, detective films, family comedies, etc., are broadcast on television every day. Some of them depict American detectives "defeating" Soviet "spies" or the "conspiracy groups" of a certain socialist country. Obviously, this is in line with the American government's political intention to incite the Japanese people's hostility towards the Soviet Union and socialist countries and to undermine the Japanese people's will to fight for peace. At the same time, the United States also provides many television newsreels. These newsreels are produced with very high technical skill, so the viewership rate is very high. It is taking over the tasks that "Reader's Digest" can no longer accomplish today. Television newsreels featuring Eisenhower's speeches and domestic developments in the United States have become the most effective means of political propaganda for the United States to win the Japanese people's good impression.

    American films play an even greater role than television in transplanting American culture. American films account for a large proportion of the Japanese market. During the decade from 1946 to 1955, the total number of foreign films screened in Japan reached 1,544, of which 1,105 were American films. The quota system for importing foreign films implemented in Japan was formulated under American pressure, so American films have absolute priority.

    Japan is one of the countries with the largest number of moviegoers in the world (according to 1956 statistics, the cumulative number of moviegoers was about one billion). Considering the broad mass appeal of movies in Japan, we can see how profound and far-reaching the influence of American culture through movies is.

    As for the foreign newsreels screened in Japan, they are almost entirely monopolized by the United States. In 1956, a total of 265 foreign newsreels were screened in Japan, of which 212 were American.

    In addition, there is propaganda directly carried out by the American government. In terms of broadcasting, there is the "Voice of America," which has been broadcasting current affairs commentaries and speeches by famous Japanese people who have traveled to the United States to Japanese listeners since 1951. In terms of film, since 1948, the Education and Information Bureau of the American occupation forces has loaned 1,300 16mm film projectors to all prefectures in Japan. The content of the films provided by the United States is mostly to eulogize the United States, slander the Soviet Union and the communist movement, and promote how the "democratic forces" centered on the United States save the world from "red" threats, and so on. In 1951, 348 million people were mobilized by this projection program. After the conclusion of the Treaty of San Francisco, the American Embassy took over this propaganda work in 1954 and is still continuing it through the Japanese Ministry of Education.

    During the occupation period and thereafter, the United States directly or indirectly instilled the American lifestyle into the Japanese people through film, broadcasting, publishing, and so on. The intrusion of American culture has had a profound spiritual impact on the Japanese people, especially the younger generation.

    First, the American ideas of individualism and pragmatism have generated a life attitude centered on personal interests and acting according to the principles of utilitarianism and pragmatism, and thus also a tendency to disregard social responsibility and only care about personal immediate interests. Instead of striving for social ideals, people only pursue the comfort of personal life. Therefore, the so-called American-style "efficient" lifestyle of obtaining the greatest benefit with the least effort is respected. The prevalence of gambling in Japan is one of the reasons for the increasing rise of this unproductive tendency to gain without labor.

    Second, this pursuit of a comfortable life makes it impossible for people to arrange their lives according to long-term plans, but can only produce a momentarism that pursues instantaneous self-satisfaction. This is a psychological state that is compatible with the very urgent tone and rapid scene changes of American television news. Pursuing momentary pleasure will lose the joy of appreciating the enduring beauty of art and the pleasure of thinking.

    Third, this momentarism, combined with passive mass entertainment, will make the phenomenon of entertainment and lack of educational content in radio and television programs increasingly serious.

    Fourth, due to the pursuit of life enjoyment, coupled with the emergence of the American-style monthly installment sales system, and in order to satisfy the vanity of the petty bourgeoisie, large department stores are competing to supply household goods, televisions, furniture equipment, etc. in large quantities in this way, a middle-class lifestyle consciousness has also emerged among some of the working class. In particular, modern apartment-style housing has aroused a consumption competition in Japan to show off American-style "cultural" life to each other. For example, in apartment-style housing, there has been such a comedy: many families bought televisions through monthly installment payments, so families who could not afford them also bought antennas and installed them outside to pretend.

    In short, through the advertisements of radio, television, and movies, the efforts of American large enterprises to promote their products to the Japanese consumer masses have been quite successful. In Japan, many daily necessities such as medicines, cosmetics, and food are trademarked with American names, and anything with the words "Made in USA" is generally welcomed, regardless of its content.

    From this, there is also a trust and worship of American technology. Recently, due to the Soviet Union's established leading position in the research of intercontinental ballistic missiles and artificial satellites, the general public in Japan may gradually change their views on the United States in the future.

    Although the above-mentioned phenomena show a deep American influence, I don’t think it has taken root in Japan. The efforts of the Japanese people to develop and inherit their traditional culture are gradually raising their heads from the progressive cultural movement. With the development of the anti-atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb, peace-keeping movement, and changes in the international situation, the Japanese people's feelings towards the United States are changing, and they will adopt a more objective and critical attitude in the future.

    Although the Japanese people have accepted many American elements in their customs and tastes, it cannot be said that the depths of their thoughts and ideologies have also been Americanized. Rather, the current trend of Americanization has reached its limit, and it will enter a period of restoring Japan's inherent culture in the future. However, if this restoration takes a wrong step, such as the Ministry of Education's attempt to restore the "moral education" curriculum, it may also be used by the restoration movement of the reactionary forces.

    The Japanese people are working hard to make Japanese culture break away from the trend of Americanization and develop Japanese culture on its inherent tradition. How to make this desire not lead to retrogressive restoration, but to the correct path forward, is the task facing Japanese progressive cultural workers.

    美国生活方式对日本的影响
    日本评论家　南博
    战后的日本，随着社会上、政治上的变动，文化方面也发生了深刻的变化。这种变化，首先表现在美国占领期间，美国占领政策直接带给日本人民文化生活的影响上。
    美国占领军为使日本文化美国化，曾从两个方面进行控制。一个方面是对于言论自由和表现自由所加的各种限制，这是消极的政策。另一个更重要的方面是美国文化向日本的渗透，这是积极的政策。
    例如，在出版方面，在战后实行纸张分配制度、出版界面临困难的时期，美国杂志“读者文摘”的日本版却得到美国占领军的特别许可，成为发行量最大的刊物。1949年6月，它的发行份数曾达到一百五十万份。这是因为要使这个刊物成为向日本人民灌输美国思想、生活方式，散布反共、反社会主义言论的工具。这个刊物目前发行份数虽已减少到四十万份左右，但在过去十年中，它在使日本人接受美国文化方面，无疑地是发挥了最大影响的。
    广播事业方面，日本投降以后不久，日本广播协会的广播节目，便大部分为美国占领军教育情报局的广播管理科所控制。日本广播协会职员中反对美国方针的人，多数都曾遭到解职。
    目前，美国文化的影响，已不是通过广播，而主要是通过电视在向日本人民生活进行渗透。把美国的电视影片原封不动地编入日本电视节目，既不费钱，技术上也没有什么困难，这是最方便不过的事情。因此，日本广播协会和东京的两家私营电视广播台，现在一星期竟播送十七部美国电视影片。这就是说，每天有两部以上的美国西部片、侦探片、家庭喜剧片等等通过电视播送出去。其中有描写美国侦探
  “击溃”苏联“间谍”或某一社会主义国家的
  “阴谋团体”之类的片子。很明显，这是符合美国政府企图煽起日本人民对于苏联和社会主义国家的敌意、挫伤日本人民和平斗志的政治意图的。同时，美国还提供很多电视新闻片。这些新闻片都编得技术很高明，所以视听率很高。它正在接替“读者文摘”在今天已不能完成的任务。以艾森豪威尔的演说、美国国内动向等为内容的电视新闻片，今天已成为美国争取日本人民良好印象的政治宣传的最有效的手段。
    在移植美国文化方面，比电视发挥着更大作用的，是美国电影。美国电影在日本市场上占有很大比重。在1946年到1955年这十年期间，日本上演的外国影片总数达一千五百四十四部，其中美国影片占一千一百零五部。日本实行的输入外国影片的比例制度是在美国压力下制定的，因此美国影片拥有绝对优先权。
    日本是世界上电影观众最多的国家之一（据1956年统计，电影院观众累计约十亿人次）。考虑到电影在日本的广泛群众性，我们就可以看到，美国文化通过电影所进行的渗透，影响是多么深广。
    至于日本放映的外国新闻影片，也几乎全部为美国所垄断。1956年，日本上演的外国新闻影片共二百六十五部，美国的占二百一十二部。
    此外，还有美国政府直接进行的宣传。广播方面有“美国之音”，从1951年以来，即向日本听众播送时事解说或日本渡美的著名人士的讲话。电影方面，从1948年以来，美国占领军教育情报局即贷给日本全国各都道府县十六?电影放映机一千三百架。美国提供的影片，内容大多是歌颂美国，诽谤苏联和共产主义运动，宣传以美国为中心的“民主势力”如何从“赤色”威胁下拯救世界等等。1951年，通过这一放映纲所动员的观众达三亿四千八百万人次。旧金山和约缔结以后，1954年由美国大使馆接管了这项宣传工作，通过日本文部省，现在还在继续进行。
    美国在占领期间及其以后，就这样通过电影、广播、出版等等，直接地或间接地向日本人民灌输了美国生活方式。美国文化的侵入，对于日本人民，特别是年轻的一代，有着深刻的精神影响。
    第一、美国的个人主义、实用主义的思想，产生了以个人利害为中心、按照实利主义、功利主义原则采取行动的生活态度，因而也产生了不考虑社会责任，只顾个人眼前利益的倾向。不是为社会理想奋斗，而是只追求个人生活的安乐。因此，以最小努力换取最大利益的所谓美国式的“有效率”的生活方式就受到尊重。日本赌博盛行，原因之一，就来自这种不劳而获的非生产倾向的日益抬头。
    第二、这种追求安乐的生活态度，使人们无法按照长期计划来安排生活，而只能产生追求一瞬间的自我满足的刹那主义。这是同美国电视新闻那种调子非常急迫、走马灯似的场面转换相适应的心理状态。追逐刹那间的快乐，就会失掉欣赏艺术的隽永的喜悦和进行思考的快乐。
    第三、这种刹那主义，同消极的大众娱乐相结合，将使广播、电视节目娱乐化、缺乏教育内容的现象日益严重。
    第四、由于追求生活享乐，加上美国式的按月付款卖货制度的出现，以及为了满足小市民虚荣心理，大百货公司竞相以这种方式大量供应家庭用品、电视机、家具设备等等，在一部分工人阶级中间也产生了中产阶级的生活意识。特别是现代的公寓式住宅，在日本引起了互相夸示美国式“文化”生活的消费竞争。例如，在公寓式住宅里就发生过这样的喜剧：很多家庭用按月付款方式买了电视机，于是买不起的家庭，也买了天线安在外面装样子。
    总之，通过广播、电视、电影的广告，美国大企业为向日本消费群众推销它们的商品所作的努力，已得到相当成功。在日本，药品、化妆品、食品等日常必需用品，很多都以美国名字作为商标，凡有“美国制”字样的，不问其内容如何，一般都受到欢迎。
    从这里，也产生了对于美国技术的信赖和崇拜。最近由于苏联在洲际弹道导弹和人造卫星的研究方面确定了领先地位，日本一般群众对待美国的看法今后也许会逐步有所改变。
    上面所说的这些现象，虽然可以看出有着深厚的美国影响，但我以为还不是在日本扎下了根的。日本人民为发展和继承自己的传统文化所作的努力，正在从进步文化运动中逐渐抬起头来。随着反对原子弹氢弹、保卫和平运动的开展，国际局势的变化，日本人民对美国的感情正在发生变化，今后会采取更为客观的批判的态度。
    日本人民虽然在风习趣味上接受了很多美国因素，但不能说思想、意识形态的深处也都美国化了。勿宁说，现在这种美国化的趋向已达到了它的界限，今后将进入一个恢复日本固有文化的时期。但这种恢复，如果迈错一步，像现在文部省企图恢复“道德教育”课程那样，也可能为反动势力的复古运动所利用。
    日本人民正在为使日本文化摆脱美国化趋向，在固有传统上发展日本文化而努力。如何使这种意愿不是引向倒退的复古，而是引向正确的前进道路，是摆在日本进步文化工作者面前的任务。
