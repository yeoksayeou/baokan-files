Big Character Posters from Beijing State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 3

    The amount of wasted yarn is shockingly high!
    In September, October, and November of 1957, compared with the national advanced standards, our factory wasted a total of more than 7,900 kilograms of yarn. This yarn could have been used to weave more than 55,000 meters of Jingmian brand cloth. Based on 15 meters of cloth per garment, this would be enough for 11,700 people to each make a set of clothes, or 2.94 sets of clothes for each worker in the factory.
                          (Deng Mengji)
    The cost of cloth is too high
    Our factory's cotton cloth specifications are the same as those of State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 2. However, our factory's unit cost per bolt of cloth is 2.48 yuan higher than Mill No. 2. If we use the November output as a standard, the total cost will be more than 690,000 yuan higher than Mill No. 2 in half a year. This money is equivalent to the cost of 40,523 bolts of cloth. If we calculate 24 chi per person per year, it could supply 135,000 people.
                        (Shen Yaxin)
        The quality of the cloth is low
    What are the grave consequences?
    In September, October, and November of 1957, our factory produced a total of 35,817 bolts of substandard cloth, including 29,538 bolts of second-grade cloth and 6,279 bolts of third-grade cloth. This is 31,906 bolts of substandard cloth more than the national advanced standards. The price of this cloth is 22,244 yuan less than that of first-grade cloth.　(Deng Mengji) Does this conform to the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift?
    The cotton blend ratio in our factory is higher than in Beijing State-Owned Cotton Mills No. 1 and No. 2. Based on statistics for only three varieties, such as 39-count yarn, we wasted more than 39,000 yuan in September, October, and November of 1957. This money is equivalent to the price of more than 53 bales of yarn. More than 53 bales of yarn can weave 53,060 meters of people's cloth, which can provide a set of single clothing for 4,000 people. This money can support 100 farmers for 45 years (calculated at more than 7 yuan per person per month).
    Our factory's electricity waste is also very large, using 40,000 kilowatt-hours more than Beijing State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 2 each month.　(Deng Mengji)
    Why is the yarn consumption high?
    Due to the high unit yarn consumption in the cloth workshop, 7,901 kilograms of yarn were wasted in September, October, and November of 1957. If our weft density is to meet national standards, then 14,759 kilograms of yarn will be wasted, which is a considerable figure. Now I propose a few reasons for the waste, for reference in reducing yarn consumption.
    1. The number of bolts produced per sizing tank varies greatly. For example, in November, the average number of bolts of cloth produced per tank was 384, but the lowest was only 381.34 bolts and the highest was 386.7 bolts, a difference of 5.36 bolts. If the distance between the highest and lowest can be reduced, it will be beneficial to reducing yarn consumption and improving cloth quality.
    2. According to the Ministry of Textile Industry regulations, the length of each bolt of cloth after finishing should not exceed 40.22 meters for cotton cloth, but according to laboratory inspections, the actual average length in our factory was 40.41 meters in September 1957, 40.39 meters in October, and 40.32 meters in November. In this way, we gave away 27,000 meters of cloth for nothing in three months, which translates to 3,620 kilograms of yarn.
    3. For the receipt and payment system for fine yarn and weaving, our factory uses the high-Si discount rate method for calculation, but there are some abnormal phenomena in our factory's discount rate. For example: 36-count warp yarn, the actual twist is 18.77, and the actual measured shrinkage is 2.5081%; 36-count weft yarn B, the actual twist is 16.97, and the actual measured shrinkage is 3.3775%.
    The twist of the warp yarn is large, and the shrinkage rate should also be large, but in reality, it is smaller than that of the weft yarn. This is unreasonable. The consequence is that the warp yarn supply cannot keep up, and the weft yarn supply is too much, causing the fine yarn workshop to shut down due to insufficient weft yarn bobbins.　(Deng Mengji)
    Factory Director Liu is Impractical and Wasteful
    In May 1957, the factory leadership proposed installing heating equipment in the living area. In June, the Beijing Materials Supply Bureau agreed to supply our factory with thirteen pig iron boilers, but the factory leadership did not want them, saying they wanted to buy Lancashire boilers. Later, the minister introduced them to the Northwest Textile Management Bureau for transfer, but it was unsuccessful. As a result, the thirteen pig iron boilers from the Beijing Materials Supply Bureau were also gone, and at the same time, the 30 tons of seamless steel pipes and two water pumps (worth about 29,100 yuan) that were obtained are piling up in the warehouse. We feel that the leadership's purchase of Lancashire boilers is itself a waste. The State Council has issued instructions that Lancashire boilers are only allowed for industrial production (because they are high-pressure boilers) and are not allowed for residential purposes.　(Meng Fanqi)
    Sizing Fluff is Piling Up!
    The inventory of sizing fluff is 1,067 meters, equivalent to 22,191 yuan. According to the current usage, it can be used for one year, but now, it is still being replaced with towel quilts every month. Would it be better to use up the sizing fluff first and then use towel quilts as a replacement?

    Using Fuqiang Brand Flour to Paste Skylights
    The air conditioning (workshop grassroots unit name) used three bags of Fuqiang flour to paste the skylights, at 11 yuan per bag, for a total of 33 yuan. Now it has been discovered that yellow mud can also be used as a substitute. Not only in terms of money, but also because grain is a state-controlled commodity. City residents are reluctant to eat it, and farmers save fine grains to supply the needs of urban people and industrial construction. However, our factory actually uses Fuqiang flour to paste windows. I think this is a waste.

    北京国棉三厂的大字报
    用纱量浪费多惊人！
    1957年9、10、11三个月，我厂的实际用纱量与全国先进指标比较，总共浪费用纱七千九百多公斤，用这些纱可织成京棉牌市布五万五千多公尺，按一套衣服十五市尺计算，可供一万一千七百多人每人作一身衣服，也就是说可供全厂职工每人作二点九四身衣服。
                          （邓孟吉）
    布的成本太高了
    本厂市布的规格与国棉二厂一样。但是我厂每匹市布单位成本比二厂高二元四角八分，若以11月份的产量为标准，半年里共比二厂高六十九万余元。这些钱相当于四万零五百二十三匹市布的成本，若按每人每年二十四尺计算，则可以供十三万五千人使用。
                        （沈亚新）
        布的质量低
    有多大的恶果？
    1957年9、10、11三个月，我厂共生产了三万五千八百一十七匹次布，其中二等布二万九千五百三十八匹，三等布六千二百七十九匹，比全国先进指标多产了三万一千九百零六匹次布。这些布的价格和一等布共少二万二千二百四十四元。　（邓孟吉）合乎勤俭建国方针吗？
    我厂混棉成分高于北京国棉一、二厂。仅根据三十九支纱等三个品种统计，1957年9、10、11三个月共浪费了三万九千余元。这些钱相当于五十三件多纱的价钱。五十三件多纱可以织人民布五万三千零六十公尺，可供四千人每人作单衣一套。这些钱可以供一百个农民生活四十五年（每人每月以七元多计）。
    我厂用电浪费也很大，每月比北京国棉二厂多用四万度。　（邓孟吉）
    用纱量为什么高？
    布场由于单位用纱量高，1957年9、10、11三个月共浪费纱七千九百零一公斤。如果我们的纬密要达到国家标准的要求，那末浪费纱就会有一万四千七百五十九公斤，这个数字是相当惊人的。现在我提出几点浪费的原因，供降低用纱量工作的参考。
    一、浆纱每缸浆出的匹数相差悬殊，如11月份市布每缸平均浆出三百八十四匹，但最少的只有三百八十一点三四匹，最高的有三百八十六点七匹，相差五点三六匹。如果能使最高和最少的距离缩小，对减少用纱量和提高布质量都有好处。
    二、每匹布经过整理的长度，按纺织工业部规定，市布每匹最长不得超过四十点二二公尺，但是根据试验室检查，我厂1957年9月实际平均长度为四十点四一公尺，10月为四十点三九公尺，11月为四十点三二公尺。这样我们三个月就白白的多送出二万七千公尺的布，折合用纱量三千六百二十公斤。
    三、细纱和织布的收付制度，我厂是采用高司折扣率的办法计算的，但是我厂的折扣率有些不正常的现象，如：三十六支经纱，实际拈度十八点七七个，实测拈缩是2.5081％；三十六支纬纱乙，实际拈度十六点九七个，实测拈缩是3.3775％。
    经纱的拈度大，缩率也应大，但实际上反比纬纱的小。这是不合理的，造成的后果就是经纱供应不上，纬纱供应太多，使细纱车间因纬纱木管不够而关车。　（邓孟吉）
    刘厂长华而不实
    1957年5月，厂领导提出在生活区安暖气设备，6月份北京物资供应局同意供应我厂十三只生铁锅炉，但厂领导不要，说买兰克夏的。后由部长介绍到西北纺管局调拨，但未成功。结果北京物资供应局的十三只生铁锅炉也没有了，同时搞来的三十吨无缝钢管和水泵二台（约二万九千一百元）在库内积压着。我们感到领导上买兰克夏锅炉本身就是浪费，国务院曾有指示，兰克夏锅炉只准用于工业生产（因为它是高压锅炉），不准用于生活方面。　（孟繁棋）
    浆纱绒大积压！
    浆纱绒库存一千零六十七公尺，折合金额二万二千一百九十一元，按目前使用情况可用一年，但是，现在每月还要用毛巾被代替。是否先用完浆纱绒然后用毛巾被代替更好些？
                          （王云山）
    用富强牌面粉糊天窗
    空调（车间基层单位名称）用三袋富强粉糊天窗，每袋十一元，共三十三元。现在发现，用黄泥代替也可以。不仅从钱方面来说，而且粮食是统销物资，市民都舍不得吃，农民节约细粮，供应城市人民和工业建设的需要，而我厂竟用富强粉糊窗户，我认为这是浪费。
                            （王云山）
