Xinhua News Agency, 6th. TASS reports: The Soviet Arctic Flight Team recently successfully tested the use of television to assist icebreakers in surveying ice conditions on Arctic routes. An aircraft carrying a television transmission device flies above the icebreaker. The aircraft lowers the cylindrical television transmission device from an optimal observation altitude of 600 meters. Once the device begins operating, conditions ahead of the icebreaker are reflected on the fluorescent screen of a television receiver installed on the icebreaker. It is even possible to ascertain the surface temperatures of the water and ice. The aircraft's television viewing range is approximately five kilometers, sufficient for the icebreaker to select the best route.

Currently, the Soviet Union is designing and manufacturing complete sets of fixed television equipment for use on Arctic aircraft.

    在极地用电视协助勘察  苏联飞行队已试验成功
    据新华社6日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联极地飞行队最近在北极航线上试用电视协助破冰船勘测航线上的冰块，已经试验成功。载着电视传送装置的飞机飞翔在破冰船的上空，它在最适于观察的六百公尺高的地方放下电视传送装置的圆管，装置开始工作后，破冰船前面的情况就都反映到装在破冰船上的电视接收机的萤光屏上。甚至可以得知水和冰的表面的温度。飞机上电视视野的宽度约为五公里，足够使破冰船选择最好的航路。
    目前，苏联正在设计制造成套的固定的电视设备供极地飞机使用。
