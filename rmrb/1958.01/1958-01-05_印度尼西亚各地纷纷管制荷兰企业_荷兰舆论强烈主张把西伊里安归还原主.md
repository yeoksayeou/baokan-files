Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 4th: Indonesian local governments and military authorities are continuing to gradually place some Dutch enterprises under their supervision and management.

On the morning of the 3rd, the Bandung military authorities, disregarding the "protests" of Dutch directors, implemented control over the Dutch Batara Leng Paper Mill. In addition, two local Dutch hotels and an auditorium were also placed under the control of the military authorities.

In Makassar, the capital of Sulawesi Province, the managers of seventeen Dutch enterprises have formally handed over the enterprises to the military authorities for management. The military authorities have entrusted these Dutch enterprises to a "Provisional Management Committee" for management. Among these seventeen Dutch enterprises are branches of the five major Dutch trading houses that monopolize Indonesia's import and export trade and a management office of the Royal Dutch Shipping Company.

The local government of Balikpapan, the main city of East Kalimantan, has placed a Dutch-operated coal mine and a power company under its control. The coal produced by this coal mine is sufficient to supply the railway transportation on Java Island.

In Central Java Province, about one hundred Dutch enterprises, including fifty-six Dutch plantations, have been placed under the control of the authorities.

The situation of most of the controlled Dutch enterprises is normal. In some places, the management committee is composed of representatives of the military authorities, the government, and the workers to supervise the business activities of the enterprises. Many Dutch employees continue to work as usual under supervision. Indonesian workers protect the safety of the enterprises as owners and ensure the normal operation of work.

According to a report by Antara News Agency, the North Sulawesi local authorities, who oppose the central government, have not yet taken action against Dutch enterprises. In Central Sumatra, Hussein, the chairman of the "Wild Bull Division Committee" who launched a military coup, said that they would not follow the central government's approach in the struggle to recover West Irian, and that they would take action against Dutch enterprises based on a "mature plan." However, so far, there has been no news of them taking any action.

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th: According to TASS, The Hague, January 3rd: Dutch public opinion is increasingly strongly advocating that the Dutch government hold negotiations with Indonesia and return West Irian to Indonesia.

Professor Fogel said in an article published in the Catholic newspaper "De Tijd" that the demand for the return of West Irian is a just demand of the entire Indonesian people.

The Labour Party's newspaper "Het Vrije Volk" published an article by Williams, a member of the Labour Party in the Lower House, who condemned the Dutch government's colonial policy and expressed regret that the necessary majority to change the policy on West Irian could not be obtained in the Dutch parliament at present. Williams said: "We hope to hold negotiations with Indonesia. We hope that the Netherlands will show its determination to negotiate more frankly and without arrogance."

    印度尼西亚各地纷纷管制荷兰企业
    荷兰舆论强烈主张把西伊里安归还原主
    新华社雅加达4日电　印度尼西亚的地方政府和军事当局继续逐步地把一些荷兰企业置于它们的监督和管制之下。
    万隆军事当局在3日早上不顾荷兰董事的“抗议”，对荷兰的八达拉冷造纸厂实行管制。此外，当地有两家荷兰旅馆和一所礼堂也由军事当局加以管制。
    在苏拉威西省省会望加锡，有十七家荷兰企业的经理已经正式把企业交给军事当局管制。军事当局把这些荷兰企业交给“临时管制委员会”管理。在这十七家荷兰企业中包括垄断印度尼西亚进出口贸易的荷兰五大洋行的分行和荷兰皇家轮船公司的一个管理处。
    东加里曼丹的主要城市巴厘巴板的地方政府已经把荷兰人经营的一座煤矿和一个电力企业加以管制。这座煤矿生产的煤足够供应爪哇岛铁路运输之用。
    在中爪哇省，有包括五十六家荷兰种植园在内的一百家左右的荷兰企业被当局实行管制。
    大部分被管制的荷兰企业的情况是正常的。在一些地方，管制委员会由军事当局、政府和工人的代表组成，来监督企业进行业务活动。许多荷兰职员在监督之下照常工作。印度尼西亚工人以企业主人的身份保护企业的安全，并且保证工作的正常进行。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，反对中央政府的北苏拉威西地方当局还没有对荷兰企业采取行动。在中苏门答腊，曾经发动军事政变的“雄牛师委员会”的主席侯赛尼表示，他们在收复西伊里安的斗争中不按照中央政府的做法，他们要根据“成熟的计划”来对荷兰企业采取行动。但是到现在为止，还没有听说他们采取了什么行动。
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社海牙3日讯：荷兰社会舆论愈来愈强烈地主张荷兰政府和印度尼西亚举行谈判并且把西伊里安归还给印度尼西亚。
    福格耳教授在天主教报纸“时报”发表的一篇文章说，归还西伊里安的要求是全体印度尼西亚人民的正义要求。
    劳工党机关报“自由人民报”登载了劳工党下院议员威廉斯的文章，他谴责荷兰政府的殖民主义政策，并且对现在在荷兰的议会中暂时还不能获得必要的多数来改变对西伊里安的政策表示遗憾。威廉斯说：“我们希望和印度尼西亚举行谈判。我们希望荷兰比较坦率地和不妄自尊大地表明自己对谈判的决心。”
