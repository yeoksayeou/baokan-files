    Korean film "Son of the Fatherland"
    The Korean film "Son of the Fatherland" is a film depicting the growth of Korean youth and their heroic struggle to defend their country. The protagonist of the film is a young man named Dou Yong. During the years of Japanese imperialist occupation of Korea, Dou Yong followed his parents to Northeast China to make a living and experienced all kinds of hardships. After the "August 15th" victory, he returned to his hometown, joined the Korean People's Army, and became a model soldier. But just in this beautiful time, the American imperialists and the traitorous Lee Seung-man clique launched a war of aggression. Dou Yong and his comrades bravely threw themselves into battle to defend the motherland and the people. In one battle, Dou Yong served as the leader of the blasting team, leading six soldiers to blow up the enemy's bunker. The blasting heroes sacrificed or were wounded one by one, but the enemy's bunkers were also smashed one by one. Finally, the People's Army rushed forward and occupied the position. Sons loyal to the motherland won victory with their blood, allowing the glorious national flag to flutter on the land of the motherland!
