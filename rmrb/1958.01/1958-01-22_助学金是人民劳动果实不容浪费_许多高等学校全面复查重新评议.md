Scholarships are the Fruit of the People's Labor and Must Not Be Wasted
Many Universities Conduct Comprehensive Reviews and Reassessments

    This newspaper reports that, in accordance with the spirit of building the country and running schools through diligence and thrift, students in many universities across the country have engaged in heated debates about the issue of people's scholarships during the rectification movement. In these debates, many students exposed a large number of phenomena involving the waste of people's scholarships, as well as unreasonable situations such as overly broad scholarship assessments. At the same time, they put forward many positive suggestions and ways to improve the assessment process. Currently, many universities have mobilized students to assist the schools in conducting comprehensive reviews and reassessments of people's scholarships.

    According to facts revealed by students themselves from many universities, including Tianjin University, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Zhejiang University, Nanjing University, Tongji University, Nanjing Institute of Technology, Northeast Institute of Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Central South University of Finance and Economics, and Beijing Forestry University, the phenomenon of concealing family financial situations to fraudulently obtain people's scholarships and arbitrarily squandering people's scholarships is very serious. Moreover, a common idea exists among many students that once they enter university, everything is taken care of by the state, and they believe that receiving people's scholarships is a special right that they should enjoy. Some students use their scholarships to dine out or have a big meal at the cooperative; some use their scholarships to buy expensive cigarettes, buy salted ducks as New Year gifts, and frequently attend Peking opera, movies, and dance performances; some use their scholarships to buy leather shoes, expensive cosmetics, and get their hair permed.

    Many students pointed out that the implementation of the class line in scholarship matters is insufficient, and the principle of subsidies is not determined in conjunction with the students' class background and political performance. The subsidy coverage for students who are not from worker-peasant backgrounds is too broad, and there is a lack of strict review when assessing scholarships. Many students from exploiting classes, counter-revolutionary families, and with poor character receive scholarships.

    Many students criticized the schools for not being strict enough in managing scholarships. Some schools set the subsidy conditions too low; some schools do not conduct a careful enough review of students' financial situations. As a result, some students who can afford to pay their own expenses also receive scholarships, leading to phenomena of pursuing enjoyment in life and even waste. A student at Peking University said: "Scholarship subsidies are too broad. In order to accommodate the emotions of the students, the school even grants scholarships to those whom the local government does not agree to give." At the East China University of Political Science and Law, some students did not apply for scholarships, but the class leader insisted that they fill out "application forms." As for the situation of fewer applications and more approvals, that is not an isolated case. A cadre student from this college received a subsidy of 30 yuan to visit his spouse, and a subsidy of 50 yuan when his grandmother passed away.

    The opinion that the food expense standard used as the basis for scholarship assessment is too high is also a common one. Many students said, "We believe that the current living standards of university students, especially the food standard, are somewhat too high compared to workers, peasants, and students in secondary technical schools." A student at Beijing Railway Institute suggested lowering the food expense standard, arguing that students have no productive capacity yet, and their living standards should not exceed those of the general population, and they should save as much as possible for the country.

    Many students focused on examining and criticizing the idea that everything is taken care of by the state that exists among them. For example, a student at Qingdao Medical College applied for and received a set of cotton clothes, a cotton overcoat, a cotton quilt, a blanket, and a pair of cotton shoes as soon as he arrived at the school. A student at Chengdu Institute of Technology applied to the school for a scholarship, but his sister proactively wrote to the school, informing them that she could afford her brother's tuition and living expenses. Due to this idea of simply relying on the state to take care of everything, many students do not consider the country's current difficulties when applying for scholarships, but only consider their own comfortable living situations. Many students used specific facts to illustrate that the idea of everything being taken care of by the state is very serious among students.

    Through debate, the vast majority of students clarified the significance of the state's establishment of scholarships. This is the Party and government's care for the younger generation, not a "matter of course" special right; at the same time, scholarships are the wealth created by the working people and should not be squandered arbitrarily, and every penny should be carefully calculated. Based on this ideological understanding, some students requested lowering scholarship standards and tightening the scope of scholarship subsidies; some students suggested engaging in work-study programs and half-work half-study programs; some students voluntarily offered to give up or lower their originally received scholarships.

    All schools have conducted special studies on the criticisms and suggestions put forward by students regarding scholarships. Most schools have also mobilized the masses to review the family financial situation of students applying for scholarships one by one. After a comprehensive review, the original scope of scholarship subsidies has been generally tightened. Taking Shanxi Medical College as an example, among general students, seventy-one students gave up their scholarships (accounting for 6.9% of the total number of students), and one hundred and eighty-seven students lowered their grades and reduced regular subsidies (accounting for 18.2% of the total number of students), and the subsidy scope was tightened by approximately 9%. As another example, Shanghai Second Medical College reduced the subsidy scope by 6% in its preliminary review.

    In order to further improve scholarship work, many schools have revised their scholarship implementation measures and established some necessary systems. Some schools stipulate that applications for scholarships must first be democratically assessed by the class (department); some schools have stipulated subsidy standards, such as Renmin University of China, which now stipulates that only those whose average monthly family income is less than 7 to 10 yuan in urban areas and less than 5 yuan in rural areas can apply for scholarships.

    Some of the issues related to people's scholarships raised by students in the rectification movement can be resolved immediately, while others require unified research by the Ministry of Higher Education. Currently, the Ministry of Higher Education, based on the principles of running schools diligently and thriftily and opening the doors to workers and peasants, has repeatedly studied the scholarship issues for various types of students and has put forward preliminary improvement plans. These plans will be finalized after seeking opinions and approved by the State Council before they can be announced and implemented.

    助学金是人民劳动果实不容浪费
    许多高等学校全面复查重新评议
    本报讯　根据勤俭建国、勤俭办学的精神，在整改中，全国许多高等学校的学生对人民助学金问题展开了热烈的辩论。在辩论中，许多学生揭发了大量浪费人民助学金的现象，和对人民助学金的评定过宽等不合理的情况，同时还提出了许多积极的建议和改进评议工作的办法。目前许多高等学校，已经发动广大学生协助学校，对人民助学金进行了全面的复查和重新评议的工作。
    根据天津大学、北京大学、清华大学、浙江大学、南京大学、同济大学、南京工学院、东北工学院、哈尔滨工学院、中南财经学院、北京林学院等许多高等学校学生自己揭发出来的事实看，隐瞒家庭经济情况来骗取人民助学金和任意挥霍浪费人民助学金的现象十分严重。而且在不少学生中还普遍地存在着上了大学，一切由国家包下来的思想，认为领人民助学金是一种应该享受的特殊权利。有的学生领来人民助学金就去上馆子或合作社大吃一顿；有的拿助学金买高级香烟抽，买板鸭送年货，大看京剧、电影和歌舞表演；有的拿助学金去买皮鞋，买高级化装品，烫头发。
    许多学生指出，在助学金方面贯彻阶级路线不够，没有结合学生成分及其政治表现来确定补助原则。一些非工农成分的学生的补助面过大，在评定助学金时缺乏严格的审查。许多出身于剥削阶级、反革命家庭、品质恶劣的学生都领有助学金。
    不少学生批评学校在助学金掌握上不严。有的学校把补助条件订的过低；有的学校审查学生的经济情况不够认真。以致一些能够自费的学生也领取了助学金，因而发生在生活上追求享受，甚至浪费的现象。北京大学一学生说：“助学金补助太宽了，学校为了照顾同学情绪，连当地政府不同意给的，学校也给了。”华东政法学院有的学生不申请助学金，而班长硬要他填“申请表”。至于申请少、批准多，那就不是很个别的事了。这个学院有一个调干学生去看爱人，学校还补助了三十元，外祖母去世也补助了五十元。
    评定助学金根据的伙食费标准偏高也是比较集中的意见之一。许多学生说，“我们认为目前大学生的生活水平，特别是伙食标准与工人、农民、中技学生比较起来有些太高”。北京铁道学院某学生建议降低伙食费标准，他的理由是：学生尚无生产能力，生活水平不应超过一般人民，应尽可能为国家节约。
    不少学生着重检查和批判了在他们中间存在的一切由国家包下来的思想。如青岛医学院有个学生刚来校，就申请领了棉衣一套、棉大衣一件、棉被一条、毯子一床、棉鞋一双。成都工学院一个学生向学校申请助学金，但他的姐姐却主动来信告诉学校，她可以负担弟弟的学习、生活费用。由于这种单纯依赖国家包下来的思想，因而在申请助学金的时候，不考虑国家当前的困难，只考虑到自己生活上的充裕的情况是很多的。许多学生用具体事实说明同学中的一切由国家包下来的思想是十分严重的。
    通过辩论，绝大多数学生明确了国家设置助学金的意义。这是党和政府对青年一代的关怀，不是什么“理所当然”的特殊权利；同时助学金是劳动人民创造的财富，不能随意挥霍，用每个钱都应当精打细算。在这种思想认识的基础上，有的学生要求降低助学金标准，紧缩助学金的补助面；有的学生建议搞勤工俭学、半工半读；有的学生自动提出放弃或降低原领的助学金。
    各个学校对于学生在助学金方面提出的批评和建议，都认真地进行了专题研究。多数学校还发动了群众，逐个地审查了申请助学金学生的家庭经济情况。经过全面检查以后，较普遍地紧缩了原来助学金的补助面。以山西医学院为例，在一般学生中，放弃助学金的七十一人（占学生总数的6.9％），降低等级和减少定期补助的一百八十七人（占学生总数的18.2％），补助面紧缩了约9％。又如上海第二医学院，初步检查就减少了6％的补助面。
    为了进一步改进助学金工作，许多学校重新修订了助学金的实施办法，建立了若干必要的制度。有的学校规定申请助学金须先经班（系）民主评议；有的学校规定了补助标准，如中国人民大学现在规定：一般家庭收入平均每人每月城市不到七至十元，农村不到五元的才可以申请助学金。
    各校学生在整改中提出的有关人民助学金方面的问题，部分是可以立即解决的，部分还需要高等教育部统一研究。目前，高等教育部根据勤俭办学和向工农开门的方针，对各类学生助学金问题，已经反复地进行了研究，并且已经提出了初步改进方案。这个方案经过征求意见最后修改并经国务院批准以后即可公布实行。
