    New Customs in the New Countryside
    ——A Record of the Patriotic Health Campaign in Dongligaoxiang, Shanxi
    Wei Zhongxiu, Wu Xinhe
    "No sparrows chirp anywhere, no rats run in any household, latrines are maggot-free, and homes have no bedbugs, lice, mosquitoes, flies, or fleas."
    "Chairman Mao leads well, the eight pests have been basically eliminated, we sleep soundly at night without being bitten, and we have good energy for work during the day."
    These two rhymes were composed by the people of Dongligaoxiang.
    Dongligaoxiang is a new type of market town in Tunliu County, Shanxi Province. The township has a total of fourteen natural villages, fifteen agricultural cooperatives, two thousand four hundred households, and over ten thousand people. Before liberation, this township suffered under the long-term rule of Japanese invaders, Chiang, Yan bandits, and the landlord class, and the people lived a miserable life. After liberation, through several years of effort, the township has basically eliminated sparrows, rats, bedbugs, lice, mosquitoes, flies, maggots, and fleas, and has become a provincial model of hygiene, receiving banners and other material rewards. What was the situation in this township in the past? And how did it become a model of hygiene?
    "Village of the Sickness Demon"
    Before liberation, this township suffered from various diseases every year, such as typhoid fever, dysentery, measles, malaria, and smallpox, and the mortality rate was very high. In 1943, the number of people who got sick accounted for 32% of the total population, of which the mortality rate accounted for 17% of the morbidity rate. The township originally had eight thousand and thirty-one people, but by the time of liberation, there were only seven thousand and forty-five people. The most serious was Xialigaocun, where a total of one hundred and fourteen households suffered from typhoid fever, and eighty-two people died, including twenty-nine households such as Xing Jinke and Wang Laijin, who were completely wiped out. At that time, Ligaoxiang was known as the "Village of the Sickness Demon," and the neighboring villages also had a saying: "Don't marry a daughter to Ligaocun, marrying into Ligaocun is like being cursed by a disaster star."
    Removing the "Stumbling Block"
    After liberation, the Party and the People's Government actively mobilized the masses to carry out health campaigns. In 1952, American imperialism launched a bacteriological war in Korea. In order to oppose this inhuman act, Dongligaoxiang launched a patriotic health campaign. However, this movement did not unfold smoothly and was hampered by the habitual forces of the local masses. At that time, the residents of the township did not understand the benefits of hygiene. They had lived that way for many years, generally not washing their faces in the morning, not washing their hands when making dough, living with livestock, not washing their clothes for years, and having all six pests (bedbugs, lice, rats, mosquitoes, flies, and fleas) in their homes. In addition, many people had superstitious ideas such as "life and death are determined by fate, wealth and honor are determined by heaven," and they said, "If you eat grains, how can you not get sick?" "If it's not dirty, you won't get sick." Therefore, when grassroots cadres went to mobilize the masses to improve hygiene, they were opposed by the masses, causing some cadres to become discouraged and unwilling to continue. After health cadre Li Jin'e was scolded by the masses, she cried and asked to resign. She said: "I wasted work, ran into snags, offended people, and spoiled the mood. I won't talk about hygiene anymore!" Some people also felt that doing this work not only wasted work but also made them suffer, which was a thankless task. In response to this situation, the Party and government leaders of the township convened various meetings in a timely manner, conducted detailed analysis and research, first rectified the thinking of the cadres, and then organized a propaganda team, using all propaganda tools and occasions, using methods such as recalling comparisons and detailed calculations, individual discussions, and mutual connections to mobilize. Through such relatively detailed and in-depth publicity and education, the majority of the masses realized that carrying out the health campaign was beneficial and harmless, and indeed a good thing, thereby breaking through the "stumbling block" and launching the health campaign. Initially, the township implemented the separation of people and livestock, and regularly cleaned houses and streets. Then, they raised the well platform on two hundred and seventy-eight wells, made well covers, and built well sheds; they also organized carpenters to make wooden covers for two thousand one hundred toilets; at the same time, one thousand five hundred and ninety young people bought masks; and many women made menstrual belts. The township's health campaign was gradually carried out from small to large.
    Another High Tide of Health Campaign
    Since the township launched a health campaign in 1952 and achieved many results, a mediocre idea was produced among the village cadres, and the leadership of this work was once relaxed, causing the health work to be in a free-flowing state.
    In view of this situation, after research by the township branch, it was believed that the stagnation of health work was due to the fact that the leading cadres had a thought of letting out a sigh of relief and relaxed the leadership; on the other hand, some things were done that were not in line with the actual situation. For example, when promoting the combination of toilets and fertilizer separation and transforming water wells from 1953 to 1955, thirty-two toilets that affected traffic and public health were buried, and two hundred and seventy-eight water wells were transformed. Although this was a good thing, it was not well planned, and too much emphasis was placed on long-term interests while ignoring the immediate interests of the masses, which made the burden on the masses too heavy and was opposed by them. For example, farmer Sun Quanze said: "Talking about hygiene wastes a lot of work and is a heavy burden. How can it be done without toilets?" After finding out the root cause, first, the cadres' thought of letting out a sigh of relief was criticized, and then the township's Patriotic Health Campaign Committee was improved, and propaganda teams were reorganized to conduct publicity, mobilization, and organization work among the masses again. The Party, League, township branches, and village branches all assigned special personnel to be responsible for this work. Reasonable solutions were also made for the masses' wasted work and burden, so that the township's health work was carried out again. As early as 1953, they stipulated that Sunday was Hygiene Day, and established a four-check and four-compare system of "check production and compare substitute cultivation, check hygiene and compare cleanliness, check sweeping and compare fertilizer accumulation, check systems and compare execution." In the implementation, villages and villages, households and households were organized to inspect and learn from each other, and ninety-six model households and one hundred and seventy model individuals were successively evaluated, and they were rewarded and commended with red flags and certificates, so that they could drive the masses and promote hygiene work to be regularized.
    The leadership method has also been improved. They focused on Dongligao, summarized experience, organized on-site demonstrations, and promoted the whole township.
    Give Play to the Role of the Health Center
    After the realization of advanced cooperativization in the winter of 1955, the enthusiasm of the members for production was unprecedentedly high, and the requirements for health and medical conditions were also increasingly urgent. The health clinic alone could not meet the requirements of this situation. In the spring of 1956, the township's health center was established with funds raised by the members, and was responsible for the prevention and treatment work of the whole township. Health rooms were also established in each agricultural cooperative, and forty-four people, including midwives, health workers, and village doctors, who were distributed throughout the township, were appropriately assigned and placed. This created favorable conditions for further carrying out health work.
    After the establishment of the station, the collective wisdom of everyone was brought into play, and thirteen methods of killing sparrows, eight methods of killing flies, and seven methods of killing mosquitoes and larvae were created and synthesized. In addition, twelve methods of accumulating fertilizer were also devised. At the same time, Sun Shouxin, a doctor at the station, collected the deeds of the local Ma Laibao millet being damaged by sparrows and the health model Sun Yuxiang, made twelve sets of models for exhibition, and used meetings, folk schools, and dining halls to carry out publicity. In 1956 alone, there were one hundred and forty-five exhibitions, and more than ten thousand people were educated. Last spring, members of each cooperative were organized into youth shock teams, children's pupa digging teams, women's cleaning teams, etc., to carry out hygiene work. The township also trained and improved forty-six health workers and midwives, and trained one hundred and twenty-eight activists, enabling them to learn the techniques of vaccinating cowpox and disinfecting drinking water. In addition, they contacted the veterinary station to guide the masses in disinfecting livestock pens and establishing hygiene systems. During the busy farming season, doctors in the station formed mobile teams to carry medicine to the countryside for prevention and treatment. After this series of work, the township's incidence rate gradually decreased and was deeply welcomed by the masses.
    Sparrows Disappeared in Four Villages
    Sparrows are the most troublesome of the four pests, but they have disappeared in four villages including Wulizhuang, and have been basically eliminated in other villages. When the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)" was announced in 1956, it attracted the attention of the township's Party and government leaders, and they immediately studied and determined to focus on Dongligao and Wulizhuang to carry out the work of eliminating "eight pests." The slogan they put forward was: "Party members take the lead, League members are the backbone, young people are assistants, and we are not worried about eliminating the eight pests." But in the process, resistance was encountered. Some people did not understand and thought that it was killing and harming lives. For example, Cui Shucheng, an old man in Wulizhuang, said: "Sparrows and rats are all lives, and eliminating them is somewhat unconscionable." Jin, an old woman in Dongligao, prevented her children from killing sparrows. At this time, the township leaders organized Party and League cadres to publicize to the masses on the one hand, and organized one hundred and seventeen skilled shooters and young people into two teams to carry out surprise annihilation in their spare time. Through propaganda and education, the old woman Jin took out two nests overnight, caught four sparrows, and took out twelve eggs. A mass health campaign has been formed. After a month of raids, two thousand one hundred and eight sparrows were eliminated. By December, no sparrows were seen in Wulizhuang. Then, the township People's Committee organized cadres, activists, and young people from the entire township to visit the area and exchange experiences, and also rewarded Wulizhuang in a timely manner, establishing a banner. Through this year's annihilation, sparrows were successively declared extinct in three villages including Dongligao, Taoyuan, and Situ. Last summer, the township again adopted the method of transferring troops and generals and having sparrow-free villages support sparrow-containing villages, organizing twenty-five skilled shooters, led by township clerk and health model Sun Yuxiang, into five shock teams to carry out a shock week, eliminating three thousand nine hundred and ninety-six sparrows. Then, the sparrows were basically eliminated in other villages. The masses reported that the situation after no sparrows was:
    "In the past, grinding the mill was noisy,
    Now grinding the mill is quiet,
    No need to deal with those annoying things anymore."
    Changing Customs and Habits
    Now Dongligaoxiang is free of garbage everywhere, free of weeds in front of and behind the houses, and most of the walls are painted as white as snow. With the backdrop of various trees and forests, it looks particularly fresh, clean, and tidy. Last autumn, the heads of health centers in all counties visited Dongligaoxiang and found no traces of rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, or flies. Some comrades visited several old ladies and children under the age of nine, and they all answered in unison: "Talking about hygiene, not getting sick, and producing more grain is no question." In terms of personal hygiene, more than seven thousand people use toothbrushes, everyone has a face towel, clothes and bedding are washed, dried, and changed frequently, and the habit of drinking raw water has been fundamentally changed. 91% of the babies in the township were born using the new method of delivery, and most women used menstrual belts. In short, Dongligaoxiang has changed its customs and habits, completely changed the dirty face of the past that did not pay attention to hygiene, and unprecedentedly established new customs, showing the brilliant scene of a new socialist countryside.
    Continue to Move Forward
    Through the development of health work, the township has also greatly promoted and improved production. In the past six years, a total of two hundred and forty-nine thousand four hundred and twenty rats and sparrows, six thousand eight hundred and thirty kilograms of fly maggots have been eliminated, and one million one hundred and fourteen thousand two hundred and forty dan of fertilizer have been accumulated. At the same time, the attendance rate has increased from 55% in 1951 to more than 97%, and grain production has also increased year by year, with an average annual increase of 22.8% in unit yield per mu. The reasons for the increase in production are mainly more fertilizer accumulation, strong labor force, and high attendance rate.
    Now, the cadres and masses of Dongligaoxiang are determined to eliminate all the eight pests. According to the spirit of the "National Agricultural Development Program" (Revised Draft), they have formulated a plan to strive to eliminate all the remaining "five pests" of the "eight pests" within two years, so that they will be eradicated and extinct.
    The experience of Dongligaoxiang in carrying out the health campaign proves that as long as the leadership is strengthened, the masses are relied on, the combination with production is close, the methods are practical and feasible, and with the help of collective wisdom and efforts, the "eight pests" will definitely be eradicated and extinct.

    新农村里新风尚
    ——记山西东李高乡的爱国卫生运动
    魏忠秀　吴欣和
    “处处无雀叫，户户无鼠跑，茅房没有蛆，家无臭虫、虱子、蚊蝇蚤。”
    “毛主席好领导，八害基本消灭了，黑夜睡觉不受咬，白天劳动精神好。”
    这两首顺口溜是东李高乡群众编的。
    东李高乡是山西省屯留县的一个新型集镇乡，全乡共有十四个自然村，十五个农业社，二千四百户人家，一万余口人。解放前这个乡曾受着日寇、蒋、阎匪帮和地主阶级的长期统治，人民生活悲惨不堪。解放后，经过几年来的努力，全乡已经基本上消灭了麻雀、老鼠、臭虫、虱子、蚊、蝇、蛆、蚤，并且成为全省的卫生模范乡，先后获得了锦旗等物质奖励。这个乡过去是怎样的情况呢？它又是怎样变成卫生模范乡的呢？
    “病魔乡”
    在解放以前，这个乡每年要流行伤寒、痢疾、麻疹、疟疾、天花等各种疾病，死亡率非常高。1943年全乡生病的人就占到人口总数的32％，其中死亡率占发病率的17％。全乡原来有八千零三十一人，到解放的时候却只有七千零四十五人了。最严重的是下李高村，全村共有一百一十四户，因患伤寒而死亡的就达八十二人，其中还有邢金科、王来金等二十九户死的绝了后。当时的李高乡被人们称为“病魔乡”，邻近村也流传着“有女不嫁李高村，嫁到李高受灾星”的话。
    搬掉“绊脚石”
    解放后，党和人民政府积极发动群众开展卫生运动。1952年，美帝国主义在朝鲜发动了细菌战，为了反对这种残无人道的行为，东李高乡开展爱国卫生运动。但是这个运动没有顺利展开，受到了当地群众习惯势力的阻碍。当时，该乡的居民并不懂得卫生的好处，他们长年累月就是那么生活着，普遍是清早不洗脸，和面不洗手，人畜同居，成年不洗衣裳，家里六害（臭虫、虱、鼠、蚊、蝇、蚤）俱全。加上不少群众又存在着“生死由命，富贵在天”的迷信思想，他们说：“吃上五谷杂粮，那有不生灾的？”“不干不净，吃上没病。”因此，当基层干部去发动群众搞卫生的时候，曾遭到群众的反对，致使一些干部垂头丧气，不愿再干。卫生干部李金娥受到群众责骂后，哭哭啼啼要求辞职。她说：“误了工，碰了钉，惹了人，败了兴，说什么我也不再搞讲卫生！”也有些人感到搞这项工作不但误工，还要受气，是出力不讨好。针对这种情况，乡的党政领导方面及时召开了各种会议，进行了细致的分析和研究，首先整顿了干部思想，接着组织了宣传队伍，利用一切宣传工具和场合，采用回忆对比算细账，个别座谈相互串连等方法进行发动。通过这样比较细致深入的宣传教育，使大多数群众知道了搞卫生运动有益无害，确实是一件好事情，从而突破了“绊脚石”，开展了卫生运动。起初在该乡实行人畜分居，定期打扫住舍和街头。接着在二百七十八眼井上加高井台，做了井盖，搭起井棚；又组织木匠为二千一百个厕所做了木盖；同时有一千五百九十个青年买了口罩；不少妇女做了月经带。该乡的卫生运动就这样由少到多地逐步开展了起来。
    再掀起卫生运动高潮
    自从1952年该乡搞起了卫生运动，获得了不少的成绩以后，在乡村干部中产生了一种差不多的思想，曾一度放松了对这项工作的领导，致使卫生工作处于自流状态。
    鉴于这种情况，经乡支部研究，认为卫生工作之所以停滞，一方面是由于领导干部产生了松一口气的思想，放松了领导；另一方面是有些事情做得不切合实际情况，例如1953年到1955年提倡合厕分肥、改造水井的时候，将影响交通和公共卫生的三十二个厕所埋掉，把二百七十八眼水井作了改造。这虽然是件好事，但由于没有进行很好的规划，过多地强调了长远利益，而忽视了群众的眼前利益，使群众负担太重，遭到他们的反对。如农民孙全则说：“讲卫生误工多，负担重，没有厕所怎能行。”找出了根源以后，首先批判了干部中的松一口气思想，接着又健全了乡爱国卫生运动委员会，并且重新组织宣传队伍，向群众再次进行了宣传发动和组织工作。党团乡支部和各村支部还确定了专人负责这一工作。对于群众误工、负担也作了合理的解决，使全乡卫生工作又搞了起来。他们早在1953年就规定了星期日为卫生日，定出“查生产、比代耕，查卫生、比干净，查扫除、比积肥，查制度、比执行”的四查四比制度。在执行中，先后组织村与村、户与户相互检查，观摩评比，先后评出了九十六户模范户和一百七十个模范人物，并且以插红旗和发奖状等对他们进行了奖励和表扬，使他们带动群众，把卫生工作推向了经常化。
    对于领导方法也作了改进，他们以东李高为重点，总结经验，组织观摩示范，以推动全乡。
    发挥保健站作用
    1955年冬，全乡实现高级合作化以后，社员的生产情绪空前高涨，对于卫生医疗条件的要求也日渐迫切，单靠卫生所已不能适应这种形势的要求。1956年春，由社员集资，成立了乡的保健站，负责全乡的预防和治疗工作。各农业社也都设立了保健室，把分布在全乡的接生员、保健员、在乡医生等四十四人，作了适当的分配和安置。这就为进一步开展卫生工作创造了有利的条件。
    建站之后，发挥了大家的集体智慧，创造和综合了十三种灭雀法，八种灭蝇法和七种灭蚊蛆法。此外，还想出了十二种积肥方法。同时，站内医生孙守信，搜集了本乡马来保谷子被麻雀糟害和卫生模范孙玉祥的事迹，做了十二套模型展出，并且利用会议、民校、饭场等场合进行宣传，仅1956年即展出一百四十五次，使一万余人受到了教育。去年春又将各社社员组成了青年突击队、儿童挖蛹队、妇女清扫队等，进行卫生工作。乡里对四十六名保健员、接生员也进行了训练提高，培养了一百二十八名积极分子，使他们学会了接种牛痘和饮水消毒的技术。此外还和兽医站接洽好，指导群众进行了畜圈消毒和订立卫生制度。农忙的时候就把站内的医生组成巡回小组，担药下乡进行防治工作。经过这一系列的工作，该乡发病率逐渐下降，深受群众欢迎。
    四村麻雀绝迹
    麻雀是四害之中最难缠的，但是，在五里庄等四个村已经绝迹，其它各村也被基本消灭。当1956年“全国农业发展纲要（草案）”公布以后，引起了该乡党政领导的注意，当即研究确定，以东李高、五里庄为重点，开展灭“八害”工作。他们提出的口号是：“党员起带头，团员为骨干，青年为助手，消灭八害不发愁”。但是在进行中遇到了阻力，一部分群众思想不通，认为这是杀生害命。如五里庄崔树成老汉说：“麻雀老鼠都是命，消灭有些丧良心。”东李高金老大娘则阻止孩子灭雀。这时，乡领导上一面组织党团员干部向群众宣传、一面组织打枪能手和青年一百一十七人，分为两个队，利用空余时间突击歼灭。通过宣传教育，金老大娘一夜即掏了两窝，扑捉麻雀四只，掏蛋十二个。群众性的卫生运动就形成了。经过一个月的突击，仅麻雀就消灭了二千一百零八只。到12月间，五里庄不再见到麻雀踪影。接着，乡人民委员会组织全乡干部、积极分子和青年到该地参观，并交流经验，对五里庄也及时进行了奖励，树立了旗帜。通过这一年来的扑灭，麻雀先后又在东李高、桃园、司徒等三个村宣告绝种。去年夏季，乡里又采取了调兵遣将、无雀村支援有雀村的办法，组织了二十五名打枪能手，由乡文书、卫生模范孙玉祥等带领，分为五个突击队，开展了一个突击周，即消灭麻雀三千九百九十六只，接着其它各村也基本消灭了麻雀。群众反映无雀后的情况是：
    “过去推碾轰噪轰噪，
    如今推碾静静悄悄，
    不用再和那些讨厌东西来往交道。”
    移风易俗
    现在的东李高乡是到处无垃圾，房前屋后无杂草，大部墙壁粉刷如雪，加上各种树株林木的衬托，显得格外新鲜、清新、整洁。去年秋季全县各乡保健站长曾到东李高乡参观，根本没有发现鼠、雀、蚊、蝇的踪影。有的同志曾访问了几个老太太和九岁以下的小孩，他们都异口同声地答复：“讲卫生，不生病，多打粮食没疑问。”在个人卫生方面，有七千余人使用牙刷，人人有洗脸毛巾，衣服被褥勤洗勤晒勤换，根本改变了喝生水的习惯，50％以上的户使用了暖水壶。该乡新法接生的婴儿达到了91％，大多数妇女使用了月经带。总之，东李高乡已经移风易俗地彻底改变了过去的那种不讲卫生的肮脏面貌，破天荒地树立了新的风尚，展现出社会主义新农村的光辉景象。
    继续前进
    该乡通过卫生工作的开展，还大大地推动和提高了生产。六年来共消灭了鼠雀二十四万九千四百二十只，蝇蛆六千八百三十斤，积肥达一百一十四万四千二百四十担。同时，出勤率由1951年的55％上升到97％以上，而粮食产量也逐年提高，单位亩产平均每年增产22.8％。增产的原因主要是积肥多、劳动力强、出勤率高。
    现在，东李高乡的干部和群众都抱着最大的决心，要把八害消灭净。他们根据“全国农业发展纲要”（修正草案）的精神，已经制订了规划，争取在两年内将“八害”中所剩之“五害”全部消灭，使之断根绝种。
    东李高乡开展卫生运动的经验证明：只要加强领导，依靠群众，密切结合生产，办法切实可行，凭借群策群力，“八害”定能灭后绝种。
