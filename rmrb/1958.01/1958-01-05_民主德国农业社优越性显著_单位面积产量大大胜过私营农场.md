Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 3rd -- A significant portion of the agricultural production cooperatives in East Germany currently surpass private medium-sized farms in terms of commodity agricultural and livestock products per unit area.

In terms of labor productivity, agricultural production cooperatives are significantly higher than private farms: cooperatives require only three work-hours to produce one hundred kilograms of grain, while private farms require seven.

Agricultural production cooperatives have also demonstrated their superiority in the rate of increase of several product yields. For example, potato yields in agricultural production cooperatives have increased by 15% compared to 1936, while individual farmers' yields have only increased by 5%. Livestock farming in agricultural production cooperatives is also developing faster than in individual economies.

The achievements of agricultural cooperatives are inseparable from state assistance. Last year, agricultural cooperatives received a total of approximately 130 million marks in agricultural loans from the state. Machine tractor stations completed more than 80% of the field work for agricultural production cooperatives, and these machine tractor stations had fulfilled approximately 110% of their annual plan by December 12th of last year. State-owned farms also supplied high-quality seeds to agricultural cooperatives.

The production achievements of agricultural cooperatives have promoted their organizational development. Currently, 65% of the villages in East Germany have agricultural production cooperatives.

    民主德国农业社优越性显著
    单位面积产量大大胜过私营农场
    新华社柏林3日电　民主德国很大一部分的农业生产合作社在单位面积的商品农产品和畜产品方面，目前已经超过私营的中型农场。
    在劳动生产率方面，农业生产合作社大大高于私营农场：合作社生产一百公斤谷物只需要三个工时，而私营农场要七个工时。
    在若干产品产量提高的速度方面，农业生产合作社也显出了它的优越性。例如，农业生产合作社的马铃薯产量比1936年提高了15％，而个体农民的产量只提高了5％。农业生产合作社的牲畜饲养也比个体经济发展得快。
    农业合作社所获得的成就和国家的帮助是分不开的。去年农业合作社从国家得到的农业贷款总额达一亿三千万马克左右。机器拖拉机站为农业生产合作社完成了80％以上的田间工作，这些机器拖拉机站的年度计划到去年12月12日为止已经完成了110％左右。国营农场也给农业合作社供应了上等种籽。
    农业合作社在生产上的成就促进了它在组织上的发展。目前民主德国65％的乡村已经有了农业生产合作社。
