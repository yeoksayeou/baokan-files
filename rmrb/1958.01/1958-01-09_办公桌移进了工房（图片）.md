    The Office Desk Moves Into the Workshop

    During the rectification campaign, cadres in the various workshops of the Tianjin Shoe Factory moved their desks into the workshops. They would take up their pens to work, grab their tools to do labor, and discuss and solve problems with workers on the spot. This greatly promoted production.

    Right picture: When the cadres have less administrative work, they work with the workers. Liu Shuchun (left), deputy director of the first workshop, is making shoe uppers with the workers. Xinhua News Agency reporter Liang Yiding photo

    办公桌移进了工房
    在整风运动中，天津制鞋厂各个车间的干部把办公桌搬进了工房，他们拿起笔就办公，操起工具就干活，发现问题当场就和工人商量解决。这样作大大推动了生产。
