The expansion of the Zigui Coal Mine in the Yichang Special District of Hubei Province, including the Huangyangpan mine shaft and the new Xiangjiadian mine shaft, is now under full construction.

Both of these mine shafts are inclined shafts, and the coal seams are very close to the surface. Once fully completed, they will be able to produce 100,000 tons of raw coal annually. Except for manual operation in coal mining, most of the mine's operations, such as tunneling, coal crushing, coal washing, and hoisting, are mechanized.

    扩建秭归煤矿
    湖北省宜昌专区秭归煤矿扩建黄杨畔矿井与新建向家店矿井，已经全面施工。
    这两个矿井都是斜井，煤层离地面很近，全部竣工后，可年产十万吨原煤。这个矿除采煤仍用手工操作外，掘进、碎煤、洗煤、提升等大部分采用机械。
