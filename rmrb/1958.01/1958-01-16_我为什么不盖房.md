    I Why I Don't Build a House
    I am fifty years old this year. My family has seven members, but my eldest son, Hu Changwu, joined the army in the spring of the year before last, so there are actually six of us. Since joining the cooperative in 1953, my family's income has increased year by year. In 1956, our income was more than 470 yuan, and in 1957, it was more than 540 yuan. Adding in the income from household side occupations, the average income per person is over 100 yuan.
    With so much income, in theory, my life should be greatly improved. For example: I need to build two houses, wear better clothes, eat better food... But we didn't do that. The house wasn't good, so we bought twenty yuan worth of tiles to add to it. The clothes we wear are usually old and torn. New clothes are only worn during festivals or when visiting relatives. Last summer, my daughter-in-law, Tan Zheying, wanted to make a pair of "Xiangyun gauze" pants, but we discussed it for a long time and decided not to. In terms of food and drink, we have always maintained two meals of thin porridge and one meal of dry food, only eating more dry food during the busy farming season.
    I have also met many people like Huang Xiuying, who kindly advised me: "Uncle Hu! Your family has so much income, you can't take it with you when you're born, and you can't take it with you when you die. Those who work should enjoy themselves! Why not improve your life?" I always have to explain it to them in detail for a long time:
    Taking my current life as an example, it is truly better than it was in the past. I started working as a farmhand at the age of thirteen. Later, I was able to start a family thanks to the help of relatives, but I incurred a debt of more than two hundred silver dollars. What I earned in a year was not enough to cover the year, and the Kuomintang's monthly donations and rice levies were always at the door. It was not until after liberation that I was able to turn over and get ahead. Now we have food, clothing, and use, and even have a surplus. My eldest son has gone to the army. He was illiterate before liberation, but now he can write letters. My daughter-in-law, Tan Zheying, is the deputy captain of the production team and a member of the Communist Youth League. The organization has educated her to be diligent and capable, and she has won several model awards. And my two sons, aged fourteen and eleven, are in school. I never dreamed of such a life in the past!
    When I joined the cooperative in 1953, I once said: "I would be happy to see a tractor that year, even if I didn't eat." Who knew that in 1956, we had a tractor station here. I have touched the machine, I have worked with the machine, and I have seen with my own eyes the machine plowing, harrowing, and sowing in our cooperative... I heard that mechanization will be realized in the future, then won't our lives be like those of the Soviet people in the movies? In the past, it was bragging to say that one mu of land could produce one hundred jin of ginned cotton; last year, our cooperative's more than nine hundred mu of cotton fields produced an average of one hundred and thirty-three jin of ginned cotton. The cooperative increased its output, and we increased our income. Isn't this precisely the Communist Party leading us to higher places? If everyone can be thrifty and let the country concentrate its efforts on building more factories and producing more machines and chemical fertilizers, wouldn't it be possible to increase more grain and cotton? Wouldn't our children be able to live a happier life in the future?
    As the old saying goes, "Building a family is like picking up soil with a needle, and ruining a family is like pushing sand with a wave." I believe that if you spend money recklessly when you have more income, and don't save what should be saved, and look to the cooperative when you have difficulties, then it is simply a disgrace. In the summer of 1956, I was sick for several months and couldn't get out of bed. The cooperative offered to help me several times, but I politely declined because I had savings from 1955. After I recovered from my illness, we held a family meeting, and men, women, young, and old all participated in production. My two younger sons also did some light work when they came back from school. That year, not only did we not need the cooperative's assistance, but the whole family insisted on doing more than five thousand work points, which increased our income.

### 我为什么不盖房

    我为什么不盖房
    我今年已经五十岁了。全家七口人，大儿子胡昌武前年春天服兵役去了，实际是六口人。从1953年入社以来，我家的收入一年比一年多。1956年收入四百七十多元，1957年收入五百四十多元，加上家庭副业收入，平均每人有一百元以上。
    有了这么多的收入，按理说，我的生活应该大大改善一下了。比如：我需要盖两间房屋，穿点好的，吃点好的……。但是，我们没有这样做。房屋不好，买了二十块钱的瓦加盖了一下。穿的衣服，平时是旧的、破的，新衣服只是在节日或走亲戚的时候才穿。去年夏天，媳妇谈哲英想做一条“湘云纱”的裤子，我们讨论了好久，还是决定不做。在吃喝上，一直保持着两餐稀一餐干，只是在大农忙的时候，才多吃点干的。
    我也曾经碰到过不少像黄秀英这样的人，他们好心地劝我：“胡大爹！你家有这么多收入，生不带来，死不带去，劳动的就该享受嘛！为什么不好好改善一下生活呢？”我总得详细地给他们解释半天：
    拿我眼前过的生活来说，真是比过去好上了天。我从十三岁起就打长工，后来亏了亲戚帮助才成了家，却背下了二百多块光洋的债。一年挣的糊不上一年，国民党的月捐、月米还不离门，直到解放后，才算翻了身、出了头。现在有吃、有穿、有用，而且还有余。大儿子服兵役去了，解放前一字不识，现在他已经会写信了。媳妇谈哲英，担任了生产队里的副队长，是个共青团员，组织上把她教育得勤劳、能干，得过几次模范。还有十四岁和十一岁的两个儿子在学校里读书。这种日子，过去连做梦也想不到啊！
    1953年入社的时候，我曾经说过：“那一年看得上拖拉机，不吃饭也心甘。”谁知1956年我们这儿就有了拖拉机站。我摸过机器，我陪着机器工作过，我亲眼看到机器在我们社里耕地、耙地、播种……；听说将来还要实现机械化，那我们这里不是和电影上的苏联人民的生活一样了吗？过去，说一亩地收一百斤皮棉是吹牛；去年，我们社九百多亩棉地，平均产皮棉一百三十三斤。社里增加了产量，我们增加了收入，这不正是共产党领导着我们往高处走吗？如果每个人都能够省吃俭用，让国家集中力量多办些工厂，生产更多的机器和化学肥料，不就能增加更多的粮食和棉花吗？将来孩子们不就能够过到更幸福的日子吗？
    古语说得好，“兴家如同针挑土，败家如同浪推沙”。我认为：如果收入多了就乱花，该节约的不节约，有了困难找社里，那简直是一种耻辱。1956年夏季我病了几个月不能起床，社里几次要救济我，都被我婉言谢绝，因为我1955年有节余。病好以后，我们开了一个家庭会，男女老幼都参加生产，两个小儿子放学回来也做些轻微活路。这一年，不仅没要社里救济，而且全家坚持做了五千多个工分，增加了收入。
