Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st: TASS reports that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union issued a letter to agricultural workers nationwide on the 20th, discussing the summary of the 1957 agricultural year and the tasks for further increasing agricultural products in 1958.

The letter emphasizes that despite the drought in many regions of the Volga River Basin, the Southern Urals, and Kazakhstan last year, the state still obtained a sufficient quantity of grain and other agricultural products. Compared with 1953, the procurement volume of grain increased by 18%, of which wheat increased by 41%.

The total sugar beet harvest in 1957 was the highest ever. Therefore, it is possible to produce 1.2 million tons more sugar than in 1956-57. The Soviet Union has never produced so much sugar.

Last year, the procurement volume of raw cotton increased by 334,000 tons compared with 1955. Agricultural workers sold 22% more flax fiber to the state than in 1956, and almost doubled the amount of hemp.

The letter to agricultural workers then points out that as of January 1, 1958, the number of cattle nationwide increased by 4.6 million head compared to the previous year, including an increase of 1 million dairy cows. In addition, the number of pigs increased by 5.9 million, and sheep increased by 9.4 million. The productivity of animal husbandry has also greatly improved, with increased yields of milk, meat, wool, and many other animal products.

In the past three years, milk production on Soviet collective farms and state farms has almost doubled. The resolution of the January 1955 Plenum of the CPC Central Committee stipulated that in six years, i.e., by 1960, the average milk yield per dairy cow on collective farms should reach at least 1,700 kilograms. This task has already been overfulfilled in three years. In 1957, the average milk yield per fodder-fed dairy cow on collective farms was 1,858 kilograms, and on state farms it was about 2,700 kilograms.

In 1957, the state procured a total of 20.5 million tons of milk, 81% more than in 1954.

The letter emphasizes that the rapid development of dairy animal husbandry makes it entirely possible to catch up with the United States in per capita milk production this year.

The CPC Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union emphasized that the achievements in developing animal husbandry and increasing meat and milk production are due to the consolidation of the feed base, especially the increased production of corn.

In the past year, a lot of work has been done in reducing the labor and funds spent on producing agricultural products and in reducing the production costs of agricultural products. Labor discipline in collective farms has been greatly strengthened, and labor organization has also been improved.

The letter to agricultural workers emphasizes that the summary of 1957 shows that our country's agriculture is in a period of rapid upsurge. A solid foundation has been laid for more rapidly increasing the production of agricultural and animal products and for successfully solving the task of catching up with the United States in per capita livestock product output in the next few years.

The letter to agricultural workers points out that in order to have the various necessary quantities of products needed by urban and rural working people in the next two to three years, it is necessary to develop all sectors of agricultural production and strive to maximize the potential in agriculture.

The CPC Central Committee and the Soviet Council of Ministers require agricultural workers nationwide to pay attention to some issues that should be resolved in 1958. The letter says: All agricultural workers should pay attention to the economic aspects of production organization, as well as further increasing labor productivity and reducing the cost of agricultural products. It also says that further increasing the yield per unit area of all crops is the main task of agriculture.

The letter says that so far, the expansion of the sown area nationwide has been mainly achieved by reclaiming wasteland and fallow land in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, and the Volga River Basin. Now is the time to put forward the task of maximizing the use of all land in every collective farm and state farm in the Soviet Union, which can bring us hundreds of thousands or millions of hectares of land.

The CPC Central Committee and the Soviet Council of Ministers emphasized that one of the main conditions for ensuring that collective farms and state farms greatly increase the number of various livestock and improve their product productivity in a short period of time is to strengthen the feed base. In order to complete the planned milk and meat production, succulent feed must be one to two times more than last year. This task can only be solved by expanding the corn planting area, mainly by increasing the yield per unit area of corn. In order to further increase meat and milk production, it is necessary to greatly increase the average number of various livestock and poultry per hundred hectares of agricultural land, not only by increasing livestock product productivity. The letter emphasizes that the number of dairy cows must be greatly increased.

The letter says that meat production must be greatly increased in 1958. To achieve this, it is first necessary to develop the pig-raising industry, so that meat production can be doubled or more in one year.

The CPC Central Committee and the Soviet Council of Ministers call on agricultural workers to eliminate the backwardness in developing sheep farming in a short period of time and strive to greatly increase the total number of sheep and wool production.

The letter also calls for more attention to be paid to the development of poultry farming, rabbit farming, pond fish farming, and beekeeping.

    进一步提高农作物单位面积产量和降低产品成本
    按人口平均计算的牛奶产量今年就能够赶上美国
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议在20日发表告全国农业工作者书，谈到了1957年农业年度的总结和1958年进一步增加农产品的任务。
    书中强调指出，尽管去年在伏尔加河流域、南乌拉尔和哈萨克的许多地区发生了旱灾，国家仍然获得了足够数量的谷物和其他农产品。同1953年相比，粮食的采购量增加了18％，其中小麦增加了41％。
    1957年的甜菜总收获量是历来最高的一年。因此有可能比1956—57年度多生产一百二十万吨糖。苏联从来没有生产过这样多的糖。
    去年，原棉的采购量比1955年增加了三十三万四千吨，农业劳动者向国家交售的亚麻纤维比1956年增加了22％，而大麻则几乎增加了一倍。
    告农业工作者书中接着指出，截至1958年1月1日止，全国牛的头数比上一年增加了四百六十万头，其中奶牛增加了一百万头。此外，猪增加了五百九十万口；绵羊增加了九百四十万只。畜牧业的产品生产率也有很大的提高，奶类、肉类、毛类以及其他许多畜产品的产量都增加了。
    过去三年中，苏联的集体农庄和国营农场的牛奶产量差不多增加了一倍。苏共中央1955年1月全会的决议规定，在六年间，即到1960年，集体农庄每头奶牛的平均挤奶量至少要达到一千七百公斤，这个任务已经在三年中超额完成了。1957年，集体农庄每头靠饲料喂养的奶牛的平均挤奶量是一千八百五十八公斤，国营农场是二千七百公斤左右。
    1957年，国家共采购了二千零五十万吨牛奶，比1954年多81％。
    书中强调指出，产奶畜牧业的高速发展使得在今年就有一切可能在按人口平均计算的牛奶产量方面赶上美国。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议强调指出，在发展畜牧业、增加肉类和奶类产量方面之所以获得成就，是由于巩固了饲料基地，特别是由于玉蜀黍的产量有了增加。
    去年一年在减少生产农产品时所花的劳动和资金、在降低农产品的生产成本方面作了很多工作。集体农庄的劳动纪律大大加强了，劳动组织也改善了。
    告农业工作者书强调说，1957年的总结表明，我国农业正处在急剧高涨中。已经为更迅速地增加农、畜产品的生产、为顺利地解决在最近几年内在按人口平均计算的畜产品产量方面赶上美国这个任务奠定了巩固的基础。
    告农业工作者书中指出，为了在最近两三年内拥有城乡劳动人民所需要的各种必要数量的产品，必须发展农业生产的各个部门，并且争取最大限度地利用农业中的潜力。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议要求全国农业工作者注意在1958年应该解决的一些问题。书中说：所有农业工作者都应该注意生产组织的经济方面以及进一步提高劳动生产率和降低农产品成本的问题。它还说，进一步提高所有农作物的单位面积产量是农业的主要任务。
    书中说，到目前为止，全国播种面积的扩大基本上是依靠在哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔和伏尔加河流域开垦生荒地和熟荒地而取得的。现在已经到了提出在苏联每一个集体农庄和国营农场中最大限度地利用所有的土地这一任务的时候了，这样作就可以给我们带来几十万、或者是几百万公顷的土地。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议强调指出，保证集体农庄和国营农场在短期内大量增加各种牲畜的头数和提高其产品生产率的主要条件之一是加强饲料基地。为了完成牛奶和肉类生产的预定计划，多汁饲料必须要比去年多一倍到两倍。而这个任务只有依靠扩大玉蜀黍播种面积，主要是依靠提高玉蜀黍的单位面积产量来解决。为了进一步提高肉类和奶类的产量，必须大大增加每一百公顷农业用地上平均的各种牲畜和家禽的头数，而不仅是靠提高畜产品生产率。书中强调指出，必须大大增加奶牛头数。
    书中说，1958年必须大大增加肉类产量。要做到这一点，首先需要发展养猪业，使肉的产量在一年之内增加一倍或者更多。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议号召农业工作者在短期内消灭发展养羊业方面的落后现象，争取大大增加绵羊的总数和羊毛生产。
    书中还号召更多地重视发展养禽业、养兔业、池塘养鱼业和养蜂业。
