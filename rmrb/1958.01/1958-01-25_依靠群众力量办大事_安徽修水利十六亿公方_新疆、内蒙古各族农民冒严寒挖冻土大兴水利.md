Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 24th. By the 23rd, the farmers of Anhui Province had once again exceeded their increased water conservancy project task of 800 million cubic meters ahead of schedule. The first task of 800 million cubic meters was completed in late December last year. Then, with the spirit of moving mountains and filling seas, the farmers completed the additional task in nearly a month. Now, the province has completed a total of more than 1.6 billion cubic meters of earth and stone, and the completed water conservancy projects have reached more than 1.39 million. The benefits of these projects can increase the irrigated area by more than 7.3 million mu, improve the irrigated area by more than 11.3 million mu, remove waterlogging from more than 11.5 million mu, and control soil erosion in an area of more than 970 square kilometers. According to a general inspection in various places, it has been proved that this year's water conservancy projects are not only numerous but also of good quality and fast construction.

The brilliant achievements of Anhui Province in mobilizing the masses to build water conservancy projects have given an extremely profound education to cadres with conservative ideas. Now, these cadres have to believe in the power of the people. All the small-scale water conservancy earthwork projects in the province are self-managed by the masses, without requiring any state funding. Those who originally relied on appropriations from higher authorities to build water conservancy projects also admitted that as long as they rely on the masses and use the masses' financial, material, and human resources, they can also accomplish great things.

At present, there are still more than 450,000 water conservancy projects under construction in the province. In the future, in addition to continuing to do a good job in the unfinished projects, it is also necessary to seize the time to do a good job in ancillary projects such as culverts and gates, so as to store water as soon as possible, so that one project can be built, and one project can play a role, and the sooner it is built, the sooner it will play a role. According to information from relevant departments, it is estimated that the province will have to do another 400 million cubic meters of work. Various localities have decided to conduct another general inspection of the quality of the projects. If the quality is found to be unqualified, farmers will be immediately organized to find ways to remedy it.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 24th, farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia are braving wind and snow, digging frozen soil, and building and renovating farmland water conservancy projects.

At present, the dozens of water conservancy projects that have been completed by farmers in Xinjiang and agricultural production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region can expand the irrigated area by about 500,000 mu, equivalent to 25% of the annual task; and improve the irrigation conditions of 1.07 million mu of cultivated land. Since last winter, farmers of all ethnic groups have also carried out winter irrigation on more than 8 million mu of land. On both sides of the Kashgar River and Yarkand River in southern Xinjiang, thousands of people are building canals, drainage ditches, and reservoirs, and clearing silt from old canals every day. In order to complete the Aksashas Reservoir construction site in Shule County on schedule, the number of migrant workers has increased from 8,000 to 12,000. The farmers have automatically built temporary houses on the construction site and insisted on completing the project in winter. More than 15,000 farmers gather at the Baoren Reservoir construction site in Yecheng County every day, striving to build the reservoir in 70 days to ensure the annual irrigation water for more than 40,000 mu of farmland this year. Many agricultural cooperatives along the Yarkand River are cutting branches and consolidating them to reduce seepage for irrigation systems with serious seepage, and combining water conservancy construction with winter irrigation to achieve irrigation as they build.

By mid-January, farmers of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had built 7,028 new canals, dug more than 2,900 new wells, repaired more than 1,200 various ponds and springs, built 33 reservoirs, and completed 195,000 mu of drainage projects in the West Liao River Basin. In addition, many farmers have also extensively carried out water conservancy activities such as ice storage and water storage and ice lifting and snow accumulation based on the characteristics of the cold and frozen land in Inner Mongolia. These completed water conservancy projects and various measures can expand the irrigated area by 950,000 mu, accounting for more than 46% of the autonomous region's original plan to increase the irrigated area by 2.04 million mu this year. Now, the plan for water conservancy construction in the entire region has been revised from the original plan of 2.04 million mu to 3 million mu.

In order to promote the in-depth development of the water conservancy construction upsurge, the party committees of various leagues, administrative regions, banners, and counties in Inner Mongolia have successively established water conservancy construction committees led by the first secretary himself.

    依靠群众力量办大事
    安徽修水利十六亿公方
    新疆、内蒙古各族农民冒严寒挖冻土大兴水利
    新华社合肥24日电　到23日止，安徽省农民又提前超额完成了追加的八亿公方的水利工程任务。第一次八亿公方的任务是在去年12月下旬完成的。接着，农民又以移山填海的气魄在近一个月内完成了追加的任务。现在，全省总计已完成土石方十六亿多公方，完成的水利工程已达一百三十九万多处。这些工程的效益可以增加灌溉面积七百三十多万亩，改善灌溉面积一千一百三十多万亩，除涝面积一千一百五十多万亩，控制水土流失面积九百七十多平方公里。经各地普遍检查，证明今年水利工程不但修得多，而且修得又好又快。
    安徽省发动群众兴修水利所获得的辉煌成果，给有保守思想的干部以极其深刻的教育。现在，这些干部不得不信服人民力量的强大了。全省全部小型水利土方工程，都是由群众自办的，没有要国家花钱。原来依赖上级拨款办水利的人，也承认只要依靠群众，利用群众的财力、物力、人力，也能办大事了。
    目前全省正在施工的水利工程还有四十五万多处，今后除继续做好未完工的工程以外，还要抓紧时间做好涵洞、闸门等附属工程，以便及早蓄水，做到修一处工程、起一处作用，早修好早起作用。据从有关部门了解，预计全省还要作四亿公方工程。各地决定再普遍检查一次工程质量，如果发现质量不合乎要求的，将立即组织农民设法补救。
    据新华社24日讯　新疆、内蒙古各族农民冒着风雪严寒，挖开冻土，修建和整顿农田水利工程。
    目前，新疆各地农民和新疆军区农业生产部队已经完成的数十项水利工程，约可扩大五十万亩的灌溉面积，相当于全年任务的25％；改善了一百零七万亩耕地的灌溉状况。各族农民从去年冬季以来，还对八百多万亩土地进行了冬灌。在南疆的喀什噶尔河和叶尔羌河两岸现在每天都有成千上万的人在修建水渠、排水渠和水库，清理旧渠道的淤沙。疏勒县阿克沙斯水库工地上的民工为按期完工，已由八千人增加到一万二千人，农民们自动在工地上修起临时住房，坚持在冬季完工。叶城县包仁水库工地上每天聚集着一万五千多农民，他们争取在七十天内把水库修成，以保证今年四万多亩农田的全年灌溉用水。叶尔羌河沿岸很多农业社对渗漏比较严重的灌溉系统，进行裁支并干，减少渗漏，并把修水利和冬灌结合起来，作到随修随浇。
    内蒙古自治区各族农民，到1月中旬止，已修好新渠七千零二十八条，打新井二千九百多眼，修好各种塘坝和水泉子一千二百多个，建成水库三十三座，并在西辽河流域完成了十九万五千亩的排涝工程。另外，许多农民还根据内蒙古天寒地冻的特点，普遍开展了养冰蓄水和抬冰积雪的水利活动。这些已完成的水利工程和各项措施，可以扩大灌溉面积九十五万亩，为自治区原订今年增加灌溉面积二百零四万亩的46％以上。现在全区兴修水利的计划，已由原计划二百零四万亩修改为三百万亩。
    为使水利建设高潮深入发展，现在，内蒙古各盟、行政区、旗、县等地党委，已先后建立了由第一书记亲自领导的水利建设委员会。
