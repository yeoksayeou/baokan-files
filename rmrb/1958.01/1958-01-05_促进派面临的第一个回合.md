    The first thing to do to promote production and construction in 1958 is to formulate an advanced plan. If the plan is conservatively drawn up, all corresponding preparatory work will also be conservative. Then, after the production upsurge is launched, the leadership will not be able to keep up. The enthusiasm and creativity of the masses can only blossom, not bear fruit. Ultimately, in such enterprises, there is no upsurge, let alone a leap forward. However, if the leadership takes the lead from the beginning in formulating an advanced plan, points out the goals and directions of struggle to the masses, and organizes all necessary preparations, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses will be doubly rewarded. Chongqing's many factories revised their low plans, and the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China criticized some right-leaning conservative ideas in the preparation of plans. These two things were done well and in a timely manner, and can be described as the attitude of a true promotion faction.
    Promoting anything will not be smooth sailing. There must also be a struggle to formulate an advanced plan. The Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China criticized the low plans drawn up by Kailuan Coal Mine and Tangshan Steel Plant, which was a struggle between advanced and conservative ideas. Many factories and mines in Chongqing initially set their plans too low, then realized that the plans were low, and revised these low plans. This was also the result of a gradual deepening of understanding and the victory of progressive ideas over the original backward ideas. Some comrades believe that in the current atmosphere of promotion, no one will have conservative ideas anymore. This idea is wrong. People's understanding often lags behind reality. It is difficult to fully estimate the potential of production and the power of the masses from the beginning, and it is even more impossible for everyone to have the same level of understanding. Therefore, in the process of promotion, the struggle against backward and conservative ideas is inevitable. It is unrealistic to imagine that the leap forward in production and construction will be calm and without ideological struggle. At present, the preparation and revision of plans is the first round of confrontation between progressive and backward, advanced and conservative ideas in this year's production and construction. The true promotion faction should, on the one hand, strictly examine whether they are lagging behind reality. If they are lagging behind, they should catch up in time. On the other hand, they should fight against right-leaning conservative ideas so that all plans are formulated as advanced as possible.
    Of course, we must be pragmatic and down-to-earth promoters. We should not sit in the office and talk emptily about favorable factors, but should go to the masses, go to production, investigate and study, find the key, mobilize the masses to find solutions, and take practical measures in technology and organization. Only the plans drawn up in this way are truly indestructible promotion plans, and only the indicators put forward in this way are resounding advanced indicators that no conservative can refute.

    促进派面临的第一个回合
    孔桑
    促进1958年的生产建设，第一件事就是订出一个先进的计划。如果计划订得保守，一切相应的准备工作也会是保守的，那么，生产高潮掀起来之后，领导就会跟不上去，群众的积极性和创造性就只能开花，不能结果。最终，在这样的企业里，就没有什么高潮，更谈不到什么跃进。而制订一个先进的计划，领导从一开始就走在群众的前面，给他们指出奋斗目标、努力方向，并且组织好一切必要的准备工作，那么，群众的积极性和创造性就会得到双倍的收成。重庆许多工厂修改了偏低的计划，中共唐山市委批判了编制计划中的某些右倾保守思想，这两件事就做得好，做得及时，称得上是真正的促进派的态度。
    促进任何一件事情，都不会是一帆风顺的。制订一个先进的计划，也必然要有斗争。中共唐山市委批判开滦煤矿和唐山钢厂订的计划偏低，这是一场先进思想同保守思想的斗争。重庆许多厂矿从原来把计划订得偏低，进而认识到计划订得低，并且修正这个偏低的计划，也是认识逐步加深，后来的进步思想战胜了原来的落后思想的结果。有些同志认为，在目前一片促进声中，不会再有谁有保守思想了。这种想法是不对的。人们的认识常常是落后于实际的。对于生产的潜力，对于群众的力量，很难一开始就估计得很够，更不可能每个人的认识程度都一致。因此，在促进的过程中，同落后、保守思想的斗争是不可避免的。幻想生产建设的跃进会风平浪静，没有思想斗争，是不现实的。在目前，编制和修订计划，就是今年生产建设中进步与落后、先进与保守两种思想交锋的第一个回合。真正的促进派，应当一方面严格检查自己有没有落后于实际的地方，如果落后了，就及时赶上去；一方面应当和右倾保守思想进行斗争，使所有的计划都制定得尽可能的先进。
    当然，我们要做实事求是的脚踏实地的促进派。我们不是坐在办公室里空谈什么有利的因素，而应当到群众中去，到生产中去，调查研究，找关键，发动群众想办法，在技术上组织上采取切实的措施。这样订出来的计划，才是颠扑不破的真正的促进计划，这样提出来的指标，才是响噹噹的任何保守主义者都驳不倒的先进指标。
