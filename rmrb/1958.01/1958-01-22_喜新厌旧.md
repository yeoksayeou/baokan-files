    Everyone Should Expose Waste

    Love the New, Loathe the Old
    The Shanghai Printing Factory of Zhonghua Book Company has appalling waste.
    The color printing workshop needed to install hot water radiators. Old workers suggested: don't buy new ones, repair the old ones and make do with them; they guaranteed it would only cost 5,000 yuan to repair the old ones. However, the factory director and the head of the general affairs section didn't listen, completely dismantling the original radiator equipment and spending more than 30,000 yuan to install new ones.
    The factory had an old elevator that hadn't been used for more than 20 years. Recently, the factory wanted to install an elevator. Old worker Liu Xilin suggested repairing the old elevator, which would only cost 4,000 yuan. The leadership didn't listen and finally installed a new elevator. The factory director even said: "The end of the year is coming, this basic construction fund will be 'wasted' if it's not used!"
    To show off, the factory decorated the auditorium like a theater, painting the stage with various colors and equipping it with various lights. In addition, they specially spent more than 15,000 yuan to buy more than 1,200 chairs with backs. The auditorium couldn't accommodate them, so they sent 400 new chairs into the warehouse.
    These are just a few examples. The workers are very distressed. They questioned the factory leadership: Why are you squandering state funds like this?

    大家都来揭发浪费
    喜新厌旧
    中华书局上海印刷厂浪费惊人。
    彩印车间需要装热水汀，老工人提出意见：不要买新的，把旧的修好后将就用；而且保证只要用五千元就把旧的修好。但是，厂长和总务科长都不听，将原有的水汀设备完全拆除，花去三万多元装新的。
    厂里本来留下一部二十多年没有用过的旧电梯，最近厂里要装电梯，老工人刘锡林建议把旧电梯修一下，只要花四千元就行了。领导上不听，终于装上了一部新电梯。厂长还说：“年底要到了，这笔基本建设资金不用也要‘浪费’掉呀！”
    为了讲排场，这个厂把礼堂打扮得跟戏院子一样，戏台漆上各色花纹，还配备各色灯光。另外还特别花了一万五千多元买了一千二百多张靠背椅子，礼堂容纳不下，又把四百张新椅子送进了仓库。
    这不过是随便举的几个例子罢了。工人们感到很痛心，他们质问厂领导：为什么要这样乱花国家的资金？
