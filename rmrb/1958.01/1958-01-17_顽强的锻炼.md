Strenuous Exercise
Soviet doctor Zekov was assigned to work in the Soviet northern border region in 1950. In order to constantly fight against the severe cold and blizzards, he began strenuous physical exercises. Zekov often skied and hunted, and rubbed his body with cold water every morning. In the summer, when storms broke up the ice floes on the Arctic Ocean, he would swim in the ocean. Zekov's physical condition was so good that he was immune to all diseases.

After three years of work, Zekov fell in love with this cold region, so he continued to work there for another three years. After returning to Moscow, he continued to exercise, often swimming in the Moscow River in winter. (Picture attached)

    顽强的锻炼
    苏联医生泽科夫1950年被派到苏联北部边区工作。为了经常同严寒和大风雪作斗争，他开始了顽强的体格锻炼。泽科夫常常滑雪，打猎，每天清晨用冷水擦身。到了夏天，当暴风把北冰洋上的冰层吹裂，他就到大洋里去游泳。泽科夫的身体锻炼得真可谓百病不入。
    三年工作期满，可是泽科夫爱上了这个严寒地区，于是他又继续在那里工作了三年。回到莫斯科以后，他仍然继续锻炼，冬天经常在莫斯科河里游泳。（附图片）
    上图是泽科夫在北冰洋里游泳情况。下图是七十多岁的契尔卡索夫冬季每天都到伏尔加河里游泳。
