Let the Shanghai Industrial Base Have a Great Leap Forward
By our reporters Ji Yin and Xi Ping

The new revolutionary situation of the Great Leap Forward, which came with the nationwide rectification movement, requires the Shanghai Party organization to further rectify its work style, improve its work, and promote socialist construction. It was under such circumstances that the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held its Second Session of the First Party Congress.

This meeting was filled with vigorous revolutionary spirit and optimism from beginning to end. "Riding the Wind and Waves, Accelerating the Construction of a New Socialist Shanghai" was the title of the report by Comrade Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and it was also a reflection of the spirit of the meeting. This meeting comprehensively discussed the rectification and reform issues in the Shanghai Party organization's rectification campaign, fully unfolded criticism and self-criticism, and enabled all representatives to achieve new unity through criticism. The content of the meeting was extremely rich, and the reporters here will only focus on reporting the discussion on the utilization of the Shanghai industrial base at the meeting.

      Great Leap Forward, Great Change

The completion of the First Five-Year Plan has brought about fundamental changes in Shanghai's appearance. One of the most significant historical changes is that the socialist revolution on the economic front (in terms of ownership of the means of production) has been basically completed in this city, which was once the most concentrated area of capitalist forces in our country. State-owned and joint state-private industries have greatly developed. In the past five years, Shanghai's total industrial output value has increased by 297.57% compared to the early days of liberation in 1949, and has also increased by nearly 100% compared to 1953, the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan. In Shanghai's industrial structure, the proportion of heavy industry has risen from 26.5% in 1952 to 41.2% in 1957, while the proportion of light industry has fallen from 73.5% to 58.8%. Shanghai's machine manufacturing industry has developed from being able to only assemble in the past to being able to independently manufacture complete sets of equipment. In the past five years, Shanghai has also produced thousands of new products and established some new industries. This means that Shanghai's industry has completely washed away the traces of its semi-colonial past. Five years is only a short period in the long history of Shanghai's establishment as a port for more than 100 years; but how big a step has this short five years taken!

This big step in Shanghai's First Five-Year Plan was not easy to take. Conservatism was one of the most stubborn ideological enemies in past construction work, which was a common understanding among the representatives when reviewing the past. Shanghai's achievements in the past five years have been tremendous, but there are also many things that could have been done and should have been done that were not done, or not done well, or done too slowly. Some comrades who are in leadership positions in the industrial sector examined at the meeting that they did not pay enough attention to local industries in the past, lacked in-depth investigation and research on the situation, and did not have a deep understanding of Shanghai's industrial characteristics—such as strong technical strength, good cooperative relationships, and the possibility of achieving small investment and quick results in developing industry—and therefore were not clear about the direction of Shanghai's local industrial development and lacked a positive attitude, which resulted in the potential of Shanghai's local industry not being utilized as it should have been. It was not until 1956, when the Municipal Party Committee put forward the policy of "full utilization and rational development" based on the central government's instructions to make full use of coastal industries, that the direction was clarified and a positive attitude was adopted.

The evil wind of right-leaning conservatism was particularly fierce last year. Some people shouted that this was "reckless" and that was "too much," which made some comrades slacken their efforts. Many things that could and should have been done in the industrial sector were abandoned or relaxed, and the 1957 industrial production plan was formulated too low. This conservative tendency was severely criticized by the Municipal Party Committee and corrected in subsequent practical work. Although this "retreat" wind was beaten back, it can be seen from this meeting that it has not been completely blown away, and wisps of small wind have still crept into the meeting place. When discussing Shanghai's industrial policy and reviewing Shanghai's past work, some people again raised the tune of "reckless advance" with many worries. Although the tone was not very high, in order to unify the thinking of the whole party in the face of the new situation, this right-leaning conservative view obviously had to be clarified.

Is it "Reckless Advance" or Leap Forward?

Was Shanghai's industrial construction a "reckless advance"? The representatives conducted specific inspections from all walks of life. The results of the inspection showed that whether it was the steel industry, the cotton textile industry, railway transportation, handicrafts, or agriculture in the suburbs..., their leap forward was healthy, and confusion and imbalance were only local and individual phenomena. In fact, there was no "reckless advance" problem at all, and the only problem was how to continue to rationally utilize the potential of these industries. For example, Shanghai's steel industry, which is a domestic small steel base, has increased its steel production sixfold and its steel output fourfold in the past five years, but it is still in short supply and urgently needs to increase production; and its potential is also very large. With only a small investment, its steelmaking capacity and steel rolling capacity can be greatly improved. Shanghai's chemical industry does not have any "reckless advance" at all, but needs to be vigorously promoted. Shanghai has extremely favorable conditions for developing the chemical industry. Shanghai consumes 5 million tons of raw coal every year. Comprehensive utilization of coal and oil to develop the chemical industry is not only necessary but also entirely possible. Other electromechanical industries, shipbuilding industries, and light industries also need to be further utilized under the unified national plan. The representatives said that Shanghai's production leap forward in 1956 played a decisive role in completing the First Five-Year Plan. It is not in line with the facts to seize on some individual problems in 1956 and arbitrarily believe that the leap forward in 1956 was all reckless advance.

The industrial policy of "full utilization and rational development" put forward by the Shanghai Municipal Committee based on the central government's instructions to utilize coastal industries is correct. It opposes both the right-leaning conservative thinking that neglects the use of Shanghai as an industrial base to serve socialist construction, and prevents the thinking of blindly developing without regard to the overall arrangement of the country, so that Shanghai's industry has obtained normal development under the unified national plan. So, why do some people insist on calling this normal development a "reckless advance"? What is "normal" in their minds? It turns out that the fact is not that the revolutionary cause is "reckless advance," but that they are conservative. The representatives pointed out that this kind of situation has almost always occurred in the past few years. In 1955, Shanghai's relevant departments were planning to gradually complete the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in two years, but only a few months later, the socialist upsurge came and the transformation was quickly completed. When formulating the First Five-Year Plan, many business departments said that the industrial development plan was set too high, but now it has been greatly overfulfilled. ... There are such people who always have insufficient understanding of the correctness of the party's policy and the socialist enthusiasm of the people, or hold a skeptical attitude. They often only see difficulties but not favorable conditions when looking at things, only see local phenomena but not the overall situation, only see negative factors and unfavorable aspects, and do not know that negative factors can be transformed into positive factors. Therefore, they dare not do things that can be done with effort; and when others do it, they are afraid of "reckless advance."

Many comrades recalled some facts in their leadership work that lagged behind the masses in the discussion, and used them to criticize their own conservative thinking. Some comrades pointed out that some things that could have been done were felt to be difficult in advance because they did not estimate the strength of the party and the masses to overcome difficulties in their own plans.

Comrade Ke Qingshi said in his report: "Since we are engaged in socialist revolution, socialist construction, this unprecedented cause, this cause of competing with imperialism for time and speed, then we must have a revolutionary spirit. ... In our opinion, it is a normal phenomenon to try to do things that can be done with effort. It is an abnormal phenomenon not to try to do it. Otherwise, we cannot talk about revolutionary attitude, revolutionary spirit, and revolutionary speed." This passage gave the representatives a profound enlightenment. Is it not this kind of socialist spirit that some comrades lack? Isn't their conservative wind generated from here?

Cannot Develop Everything on a Large Scale

The Shanghai industrial base has the possibility and the need to have a new leap forward during the Second Five-Year Plan period. But this leap forward must follow the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and building the country through diligence and frugality, and the policy of overall consideration and appropriate arrangement, rather than endlessly leaping forward and developing everything on a large scale.

The report and speeches at the meeting reflected that the policy of building the country through diligence and frugality has not been vigorously implemented in many departments in Shanghai in recent years. Wasteful phenomena exist in large quantities in factories, shops, and other institutions, but people turn a blind eye and do not feel any pain. Many representatives called at the meeting to carry out another struggle against waste during this rectification opportunity. They said: If the industrial construction leap forward does not implement the policy of building the country through diligence and frugality, then it is very likely that some major waste will occur at the same time as the leap forward.

Another sharp contradiction faced by Shanghai in the industrial leap forward is that the urban population must no longer increase and the urban area must no longer expand. Now Shanghai's urban population has reached 7.2 million. If control is not strict after large-scale industrial construction begins, it is likely to cause the population to continue to increase and the urban area to expand without limit, which will bring a great burden to the country. This issue was discussed quite enthusiastically at the meeting, and finally, two methods were roughly reached: one is to strive to increase production without increasing the number of people in developing industrial production in the future, and the labor force required for new and expanded factories will also be adjusted within the city. The second is to mobilize the surplus labor force to participate in agricultural production, and at the same time, establish satellite towns around Shanghai to disperse some small enterprises (especially agricultural product processing industries) to nearby towns. Some new factories will go there to build.

Boost Enthusiasm and Catch Up with Britain

After criticizing various erroneous ideas and reviewing Shanghai's industrial development policy at this meeting, the Shanghai Municipal Committee put forward twelve tasks for the entire party and the people of the city in the future. The first is to vigorously develop industrial production, requiring Shanghai's total industrial output value to increase by more than 100% at the end of the Second Five-Year Plan compared to the end of the First Five-Year Plan. At the same time, it is required that general light industry, textile industry, electromechanical industry, and chemical industry departments should strive to gradually catch up with or exceed the quality level of similar products in Britain or the United States during the second and third five-year plans, according to specific circumstances.

The responsible comrade of the Shanghai Planning Commission reported on the preliminary plan of Shanghai's Second Five-Year Plan at the meeting. According to this plan, the average annual growth rate of production during the Second Five-Year Plan period is 15%, and the investment in capital construction will increase by nearly 100% compared to the investment in the First Five-Year Plan. There are 126 projects with an investment of more than one million yuan. This plan is compiled based on the policies of "developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry" and "building the country through diligence and frugality", "more, faster, better and more economical" and "overall consideration and appropriate arrangement" proposed by the Party Central Committee. Its focus is on the following five aspects: supporting agricultural production; developing raw material industries; supporting key construction in the interior; saving foreign exchange and expanding exports; and meeting the people's living needs. This means that Shanghai will develop into a modern industrial base for chemical industry, precision machinery, instruments, telecommunications appliances, small steel, shipbuilding and repair, and high-end products of light and textile industries in the future.

This grand vision greatly encouraged the representatives. In the speeches in the last few days of the conference, the venue was filled with a vigorous and optimistic revolutionary spirit. Comrades from the industrial sector went to the podium one after another and announced their combat plans loudly. The quality level of Shanghai's textile industry will catch up with Manchester in a few years; Shanghai's tire industry will catch up with Britain's "Dunlop" (a famous British brand) in four years; Shanghai's "Hero Gold Pen" will catch up with America's "Parker" in two to four years.... The audience constantly accepted their guarantees with warm applause. In fact, during the First Five-Year Plan period, Shanghai had already reached the international advanced level in many products and technologies, such as various types of precision grinding machines, diesel engines below 400 horsepower, X-ray machines, 35,000 kVA cables, 1,500-fold microscopes, integrated large-traction spinning machines, etc., no less than a hundred kinds. In the next ten to fifteen years, it is entirely possible to make more products exceed Britain in terms of quality and technical level, as long as we work hard.

One of the most profound experiences of the comrades participating in the meeting this time is that "it is up to people." Really, the situation is so favorable now, as long as we boost our revolutionary enthusiasm, what can stop us from moving forward? What ideal cannot be realized?

    让上海工业基地来一个大跃进
    本报记者　季音　习平
    随着全民整风运动而来的一个新的大跃进的革命形势，要求上海的党组织进一步整顿作风、改进工作，促进社会主义建设事业。中共上海市委就是在这样的形势下，在最近举行了第一届党代表大会第二次会议。
    这次会议自始至终充满了蓬勃的革命朝气和乐观精神。“乘风破浪，加速建设社会主义的新上海”，这是中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施同志的报告题目，也是对于会议精神的写照。这次会议，全面地讨论了上海党组织整风中的整改问题，充分地展开了批评和自我批评，使全体代表通过批评达到了新的团结。会议的内容异常丰富，记者在这里只着重报道一下会议中关于利用上海工业基地的讨论情况。
      大跃进　大变革
    第一个五年计划的完成，使上海的面貌发生了根本的改变。最有意义的历史变革之一，是在我国这座资本主义势力最集中的城市，基本上完成了经济战线上（生产资料所有制方面）的社会主义革命。国营和公私合营工业有了很大的发展。五年来，上海的工业总产值比解放初期的1949年增加了297.57％，比五年计划开始时的1953年也增长了将近一倍。在上海的工业构成中，重工业的比重已经由1952年的26.5％上升到1957年的41.2％，轻工业的比重，已经由73.5％下降到58.8％。上海的机器制造工业，已经由过去只能装配发展到能够独立制造成套设备。五年来，上海还生产出了几千种新产品，建立了一些新的工业。这就是说，上海的工业已经彻底地洗清了它身上的半殖民地的污迹。五年，在上海建埠一百多年的漫长岁月中，只不过是短短的一段时间；而这个短短的五年，却跨了多么大的一步！
    上海在第一个五年中的这一大步，并不是很容易跨过的。保守主义是过去建设工作中一个最顽强的思想敌人，这是代表们在回顾过去时的一个共同认识。上海，五年来的成就是巨大的，但也有不少能够做和应当做的事情没有做，或者没有做好，或者做得太慢。在工业部门担任领导工作的一些同志，他们在会上检讨了过去对地方工业注意不够，缺乏对情况作深入的调查研究，对上海的工业特点——如技术力量较强，协作关系较好，发展工业可能做到投资小、收效快等等——认识不深，因而对上海地方工业发展的方向不明确，态度不够积极，以致使上海地方工业的潜力没有得到应有的利用。到1956年，市委根据中央充分利用沿海工业的指示，提出了“充分利用，合理发展”的方针以后，才明确了方向，采取了积极的态度。
    右倾保守主义的歪风在去年刮得特别凶。有些人喊叫着这也“冒”了，那也多了，刮得一部分同志松了劲，工业方面很多可以办和应当办的事情放弃或放松了，1957年的工业生产计划制订得过低。这种保守倾向曾经受到市委的严正批评，并在以后的实际工作中得到了纠正。这股“促退”的歪风虽然被打退了，但是从这次会议上可以看出，它还没有被彻底吹散，丝丝的小风还钻进了会场里。当讨论到上海工业的方针，检查过去上海的工作的时候，有人又忧虑重重地提出了“冒进”的论调。调子虽然不太高，但是为着使全党在新的形势面前，把思想统一起来，这种右倾保守观点显然是必须予以澄清的。
  是“冒进”，还是跃进？
    上海的工业建设是“冒进”了吗？代表们从各行各业进行了具体的检查。检查的结果，无论是钢铁工业，棉纺工业，铁路交通，手工业和郊区的农业……，他们的跃进都是健康的，纷乱和失调只是局部的、个别的现象。实际上，并不存在什么“冒进”的问题，存在的只是这些行业的潜力如何继续合理地加以利用的问题。例如，作为国内小型钢材基地的上海钢铁工业，在过去五年中钢增长了六倍，钢材增长了四倍，但是仍然供不应求，迫切需要增产；而且它的潜力也很大，只要不多的投资，它的炼钢能力和轧钢能力就可以大大提高。上海的化学工业，更不存在什么“冒进”，而是需要大力促进。上海有发展化学工业的极有利的条件，上海原煤消耗每年达五百万吨，综合利用煤和石油来发展化学工业，不但需要也完全可能。其他机电工业、造船工业以及轻工业，也需要在国家统一计划下进一步加以利用。代表们说，上海在完成第一个五年计划中，1956年的生产大跃进起了决定性的作用。抓住了1956年的一些个别问题，武断地认为1956年的跃进全部是冒进，这是不符合事实的。
    上海市委根据中央利用沿海工业的指示提出的“充分利用，合理发展”的工业方针是正确的，它既反对了忽视利用上海这个工业基地为社会主义建设服务的右倾保守思想，也防止了不顾全国的统筹安排盲目发展的思想，使上海的工业在国家统一计划下获得了正常发展。那么，为什么有些人偏把这种正常的发展叫做“冒进”呢？他们心目中的“正常”又是什么呢？原来，事实并不是革命事业“冒进”，而是他们保守。代表们指出，这几年，几乎经常是有这种情况发生。1955年上海有关部门正在计划两年内逐步完成对资本主义工商业的改造，但是只隔几个月，社会主义高潮就来了，改造很快就完成了。在制定第一个五年计划的时候，不少业务部门说工业发展计划订高了，但是现在却是大大超额完成。……就是有这样一种人的，他们对党的方针的正确性，对人民群众的社会主义积极性，总是认识不足，或者抱着怀疑态度。他们看事物往往只看困难而不看有利条件，只看到局部现象而看不到全局，只看见消极因素和不利一面，而不知道消极因素可以转化为积极因素。于是，本来经过努力可以办到的事情，他们却不敢动手去做；别人去做，他们也唯恐“冒进”。
    许多同志在讨论中回忆了自己在领导工作中落后于群众的一些事实，用来批判了自己的保守思想。有的同志指出，一些本来可以做到的事情事先却感觉困难重重，原因在于没有把党和群众克服困难的力量估计在自己的计划当中。
    柯庆施同志在他的报告中说：“既然是干社会主义革命，干社会主义建设，干这种前无古人的事业，干这种同帝国主义争时间，比速度的事业，那就必须有一股革命干劲。……在我们看来，凡是经过努力可以做到的事情，就努力做到，这才是正常的现象，不去努力做到，这才是不正常的现象。否则就谈不到革命态度、革命气概和革命速度。”这段话，给了代表们以深刻的启发。难道有些同志所缺乏的不正是这种社会主义干劲吗？他们的保守主义歪风难道不正是从这里产生出来的吗？
    不能一切都大发展
    上海工业基地在第二个五年计划期间，有可能、也有需要来一个新的跃进。但是这个跃进必须遵循“多、快、好、省”和勤俭建国的方针，统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针，而不是漫无止境地一切都大跃进，大发展。
    会议的报告和发言中都反映出，勤俭建国的方针近年来在上海的许多部门里没有得到有力的贯彻执行，在工厂里，在商店里，在其它事业单位里，浪费现象大量地存在着，人们却熟视无睹，毫不心痛。好些代表在会上呼吁，乘这次整风的机会再进行一次反浪费的斗争。他们说：工业建设大跃进如果不执行勤俭建国的方针，那就很可能在大跃进的同时出现一些大浪费。
    上海在工业大跃进中面临着的另一个尖锐矛盾，就是必须使城市人口不再增加，城市面积不再扩大。现在上海城市人口已经有七百二十万人，大规模工业建设开始以后，如果控制不严，很可能造成人口继续增加，城市面积无限制地扩大，那就会给国家带来莫大负担。会议上就这个问题展开了颇为热烈的讨论，最后大体上得出了两条办法：一条是今后在发展工业生产中力争增产不增人，新建、扩建工厂所需要的劳动力也在本市调剂。第二条是，动员剩余劳动力参加农业生产，同时在上海周围建立卫星城镇，分散一部分小型企业（特别是农产品加工工业）到附近的城镇去。有些新建工厂就到那里去建设。
    鼓起干劲　赶上英国
    这次会议在批判了各种错误思想，检查了上海的工业发展方针以后，上海市委向上海全党和全市人民提出了今后的十二条任务。第一条就是大力发展工业生产，要求上海的工业总产值在第二个五年计划期末，比第一个五年计划期末增长100％以上。同时要求一般轻工业、纺织工业、机电工业、化学工业部门要根据具体情况，争取若干主要产品，在第二、第三两个五年计划期间，逐步地赶上或者超过英国或美国同类产品的质量水平。
    上海计划委员会的负责同志，在会上报告了上海第二个五年计划的初步规划。根据这个规划，第二个五年计划期间生产的增长，每年平均速度是15％，基本建设投资将比第一个五年计划的投资增加近一倍。投资在一百万元以上的项目有一百二十六个。这个规划是根据党中央提出的“在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业同时并举”、“勤俭建国”、“多快好省”和“统筹兼顾，适当安排”的方针编制的。它的重点是下列五个方面：支援农业生产；发展原料工业；支援内地重点建设；节约外汇，扩大出口；满足人民的生活需要。这就是说，上海在今后要发展成为化学工业、精密机械、仪表、电讯电器、小型钢材、船舶修造、轻纺工业高级产品等现代化的工业基地。
    这一宏伟图景，使代表们感到了莫大的鼓舞。在大会最后几天的发言中，会场上充满了一片蓬勃乐观的革命朝气。工业部门的同志，一个又一个地走上讲台，响亮地宣布他们的战斗计划。上海的纺织工业的质量水平将在几年内赶过曼彻斯特；上海轮胎工业要在四年内赶过英国的“邓禄普”（英国名牌）；上海的“英雄金笔”要在二到四年内赶上美国的“派克”……。全场不断以热烈的掌声，接受了他们的保证。上海在第一个五年计划期中，实际上已经有不少产品和技术达到了国际先进水平，如各种类型的精密磨床、四百马力以下的柴油机、X光机、三万五千伏安电缆、一千五百倍显微镜、综合式大牵引纺纱机等等，不下百余种。在今后十年到十五年内，让更多产品在质量和技术水平上超过英国，只要努力是完全可能作到的。
    参加会议的同志们这次的一个最深切的体会是，“事在人为”。真的，现在形势如此有利，只要我们鼓足革命干劲，又有什么能阻挡我们前进呢？又有什么理想不能实现呢？
