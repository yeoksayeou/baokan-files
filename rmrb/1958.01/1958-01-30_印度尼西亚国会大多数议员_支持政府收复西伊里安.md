Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 29th: Most members of all parties in the Indonesian Parliament support the measures taken by the current government to strive for the recovery of West Irian.

The Indonesian Parliament today concluded the first reading debate on the government's report on the West Irian issue. Members of the Indonesian Islamic Union Party said during the debate that the measures taken by the government are in line with the wishes of their party. They expressed the hope that the government will further strengthen its political, economic and military power. Members of the Perti Islamic Party said that the measures taken by the government are "revolutionary" and that the government should ignore reactions from home and abroad.

Members of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Islamic Teachers Association, and the Indonesian Communist Party expressed their support for the government's measures and put forward some constructive suggestions.

Isa of the Indonesian Nationalist Party said that because the United Nations is controlled by colonial countries, he advocated holding a second Asian-African conference to deal with the forces of colonialism. He also believes that the methods of struggle in the United Nations should be improved. Indonesian Communist Party members demanded that the Dutch government be given a deadline to take the initiative to negotiate with Indonesia on the return of West Irian, and that after the deadline, Dutch enterprises in Indonesia be nationalized.

Only a few members of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party expressed dissatisfaction with the government's policy of striving for the recovery of West Irian.

    印度尼西亚国会大多数议员
    支持政府收复西伊里安
    据新华社雅加达29日电　印度尼西亚国会各党派的大多数成员都支持现政府为了争取收复西伊里安而采取的措施。
  印度尼西亚国会今天结束了就政府的关于西伊里安问题的报告所作的第一读辩论。印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党的议员们在辩论中说，政府所采取的措施是同他们的政党的愿望一致的。他们表示希望政府进一步加强政治、经济和军事力量。白尔蒂伊斯兰党的议员们说，政府所采取的措施都是“革命的”措施，政府应该不理会来自国内和国外的反应。
    印度尼西亚国民党、伊斯兰教师联合会和印度尼西亚共产党的议员们对政府的措施表示支持，并且提出了一些建设性的意见。
    印度尼西亚国民党的伊萨说，由于联合国被殖民国家所控制，他主张召开第二次亚非会议来对付殖民主义的力量。他还认为在联合国内进行的斗争的方式应该改进。印度尼西亚共产党议员们要求给荷兰政府一个期限，让它采取主动来同印度尼西亚谈判归还西伊里安的问题，过了期限就把荷兰在印度尼西亚的企业收归国有。
    只有少数马斯友美党的和印度尼西亚社会党的议员对政府的争取收复西伊里安的政策表示不满。
