    Seoul Dispatch: After a recent increase in military pay, Syngman Rhee's soldiers' monthly pay of 360 won (approximately US$0.72) is only enough to buy half a bottle of Korean beer or a pack of American cigarettes plus a cup of low-quality coffee locally. While increasing military pay, the Syngman Rhee authorities canceled the rice supply for soldiers' families, thus making the lives of many soldiers even more miserable.
