Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: Since the beginning of winter, vast rural areas and small and medium-sized cities in many provinces across the country have launched vigorous patriotic health campaigns centered on eliminating the four pests. The pest control work in these rural areas is being carried out in conjunction with manure collection.

In Anhui Province, approximately 4.5 million people in more than sixty counties and cities have participated in the pest elimination campaign from November last year to early January this year. In Fujian, according to statistics from only six counties and cities including Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Minhou, nearly one million people participated in the general cleaning and pest elimination campaign around New Year's Day. In Jilin Province, 1,400 "rat-free" villages have emerged in twelve counties including Taonan and Nongan. In Sichuan Province, by the end of last month, seventy-one counties and cities had launched a "Pest Elimination Blitz Month" campaign. In many rural areas of Shanxi, pest elimination shock brigades and women and children's hygiene groups have been organized; Tunliu County alone has more than 4,000 such organizations. In the process of carrying out the pest elimination campaign in Shaanxi Province, all counties convened conferences of patriotic health models and pest elimination activists. In Nanning City, Guangxi Province, on the eve of New Year's Day, more than 70,000 cadres, residents, and military personnel were mobilized to carry out cleaning and sweeping. In December, Qinghai Province sent many health technicians to Xining City and eleven townships in eleven counties in agricultural areas to focus on carrying out the patriotic health campaign.

Party and government leaders in many regions are actively leading the campaign and participating in pest elimination and general cleaning themselves. Fujian Province held a broadcast rally on January 2nd. Ye Fei, First Secretary of the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee, called on more than one million listeners across the province to step up the elimination of the four pests. The CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee has established a rural health pilot office, with Gao Feng, First Secretary of the CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee, and Liang Changhan, Director of the Qinghai Health Department, serving as directors. On January 12th, all secretaries of the Secretariat of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee, vice governors of Hebei Province, and other party, government, and military leaders participated in the general cleaning in Baoding City. Party and government leaders in rural market towns in Jiangsu counties are working with the masses to eliminate pests.

At present, the pest elimination campaign in many regions has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics from Anhui Province over the past two months, more than 37,000 jin of flies have been killed, more than 3.5 million rats have been caught, and 1.29 million sparrows have been caught. In Shandong Province, more than 5.76 million rats were eliminated and more than 130,000 jin of fly pupae were dug up last year. Five counties in Zhejiang, including Jiaxing, have caught more than 470,000 sparrows and more than 100,000 rats. According to incomplete statistics from only thirty-four counties in Shanxi, including Jishan, more than 950,000 sparrows and 567,000 rats have been killed. In a single day, an agricultural cooperative in Xincheng Bu Township, Shenyang, Liaoning, dug up 25,000 jin of grain from rat holes, solving more than 27% of the cooperative's pig feed needs.

The accumulation of large amounts of fertilizer is one of the major achievements of the pest elimination and sanitation blitz in rural areas this winter. Thirty-four counties in Shanxi, including Jishan, have accumulated 450,000 carts of fertilizer. Anhui Province has accumulated more than 160 million dan of fertilizer from sanitation cleaning alone. Wuchang, Xiaogan and other counties in Hubei are promoting the use of bio-energy fertilizer, which is conducive to both environmental sanitation and production development. Tangchi District in Yingkou County, Liaoning, has dug out a total of 150 million jin of manure, enough for more than 10,000 mu of land.

    结合积肥消灭四害
    农村卫生运动蓬勃展开
    据新华社14日讯　入冬以来，全国许多省的广大农村和中小城市都开展了以除四害为中心的蓬蓬勃勃的爱国卫生运动。这些农村里的除四害工作都是结合积肥进行的。
    安徽省六十多个县市从去年11月到今年1月初已大约有四百五十万人参加了除四害运动。福建仅据福州、厦门、闽侯等六个县市的统计，在元旦前后有近百万人投入了大扫除和除四害运动。吉林省洮南、农安等十二个县已出现了一千四百多个无鼠屯。四川省到上月下旬，已有七十一个县市开展了除四害突击月运动。山西许多农村组织了除四害突击队和妇女儿童卫生小组，屯留县就有这种组织四千多个。陕西省在除四害运动开展的过程中，各县都召开了爱国卫生模范和除四害积极分子大会。广西省南宁市在元旦前夕发动了七万多干部、居民和部队官兵进行清洁打扫。青海省在12月派出了许多卫生技术人员到西宁市和农业区十一个县的十一个乡重点开展爱国卫生运动。
    很多地区党政领导人都积极领导运动的进行，并自己动手参加除四害和清洁大扫除。福建省在1月2日举行了广播大会。中共福建省委第一书记叶飞向全省一百多万听众提出了加紧消灭四害的号召。中共青海省委已成立了农村卫生工作试点办公室，办公室主任分别由中共青海省委第一书记高峰和青海卫生厅厅长梁昌汉担任。中共河北省委书记处的各个书记，河北省的各个副省长和其他党、政、部队领导干部在12日都参加了保定市的大扫除。江苏各县农村集镇的党政领导人都和群众一起除四害。
    目前不少地区的除四害运动已获得很大成绩。安徽省根据两个月来的不完全的统计，已灭蝇三万七千多斤，捕鼠三百五十多万只，捕雀一百二十九万只。山东省去年已消灭老鼠五百七十六万多只，挖蝇蛹十三万多斤。浙江嘉兴等五个县已捕捉了麻雀四十七万多只，老鼠十万多只。山西仅据稷山等三十四个县的不完全统计，已经灭雀九十五万多只，灭鼠五十六万七千只。辽宁沈阳新城卜乡一个农业社，在一天内就从鼠洞里挖出粮食二万五千斤，解决了全社猪饲料的27％强。
    积得了大量肥料，是各地农村在这个冬天的除四害、讲卫生突击运动里的重大成绩之一。山西省稷山等三十四个县就积肥四十五万车。安徽省仅打扫卫生所积的肥就有一亿六千多万担。湖北的武昌、孝感等县正在推广利用生物能肥料，既有利于环境卫生，又可以发展生产。辽宁营口县汤池区共挖出粪肥一亿五千多万斤，够一万多亩地之用。
