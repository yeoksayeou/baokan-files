    Everyone Supports the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme
    All Regions Vigorously Promote and Organize the Masses to Learn Pinyin Letters
    (Our Newspaper) News Report: Since the "Draft Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" was published, many institutions, organizations, and schools across the country have launched various activities to promote and organize the masses to learn Pinyin letters.
    The Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Department of Chinese Language and Literature of Peking University invited more than 30 linguists in Beijing to discuss the function and promotion of the draft phonetic scheme. The Tianjin Linguistics Society and Tianjin Daily jointly held a symposium for educators in Tianjin. The Jiangsu Provincial and Nanjing Municipal Political Consultative Conferences, the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, and the Qinghai Provincial Department of Education all convened symposiums to discuss the current tasks of language reform and the Pinyin scheme. Speakers at these symposiums unanimously supported the draft Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, believing that the publication and implementation of the Pinyin scheme would have a profound impact on the vast fields of culture and education in our country and would greatly benefit the development of our socialist construction. Zhou Zumo, a professor at Peking University, said that the formulation of the Pinyin scheme is of great significance both politically and culturally. 80% of the working people in our country are still illiterate, and in order to carry out the literacy campaign, we must have a better Pinyin tool. The Pinyin letters now published are better than the Zhuyin letters, as they are easier to learn and more convenient to apply. Chen Zhongfan, a professor at Nanjing University, said that now, as long as you know the twenty-six Pinyin letters and learn the spelling rules, you can pronounce each word. This can accelerate the progress of literacy and help the masses improve their cultural level faster. Wang Tiemin, Vice Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said that the workers are very eager to promote Putonghua (Mandarin). Now that there are Pinyin letters, it is easier to learn.
    Regarding the draft scheme's adoption of twenty-six Latin letters, the speakers also unanimously expressed their support. Xue Yidan, a teacher at Fuzhou No. 2 Middle School, said at the symposium that the adoption of Latin letters in the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is greatly conducive to cultural exchanges between our people and the people of other countries, because Latin letters are the most widely used letters internationally, with more than 600 million people using Latin letters worldwide.

    人人拥护汉语拼音方案
    各地大力宣传和组织群众学习拼音字母
    本报讯　“汉语拼音方案草案”公布以来，全国各地的许多机关、团体和学校开展了宣传和组织群众学习拼音字母的各种活动。
    中国科学院语言研究所和北京大学中文系邀集在京语言学家三十余人，座谈拼音方案草案的功用和推行问题，天津语言学会和天津日报社联合举办了天津市教育界人士座谈会，江苏省和南京市政治协商会议，福建省教育厅和青海省教育厅都召集了座谈会，座谈当前文字改革的任务和拼音方案问题。在这些座谈会上发言的人一致拥护汉语拼音方案草案，认为拼音方案的公布和推行，将在我国文化教育的广大领域中产生深远的影响，将大大有利于我国社会主义建设的发展。北京大学教授周祖谟说，拼音方案的制定，在政治上和文化上都有极大的意义。我国劳动人民中还有80％不识字，开展扫盲运动，就得有一套较好的拼音工具。现在公布的拼音字母，比注音字母好，既容易学习，又便于应用。南京大学教授陈中凡说，现在只要认识二十六个拼音字母，学会拼法，就能读出每个字的读音。这可以加速扫盲的进度，帮助群众更快提高文化水平。江苏省工会联合会副主席王铁民说，工人同志十分希望推广普通话。现在有了拼音字母，学起来就比较方便。
    对于方案草案采用二十六个拉丁字母，发言的人也一致表示拥护。福州第二中学教师薛贻丹在座谈会上说，汉语拼音方案采用拉丁字母，大大有利于与各国人民之间的文化交流，因为拉丁字母是目前国际间使用得最广泛的字母，在全世界，用拉丁字母的人数在六万万以上。
