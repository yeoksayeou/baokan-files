Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: TASS reports: Soviet scientists have recently achieved some noteworthy progress in their scientific expedition to Antarctica.

Soviet scientist Richter has recently completed his scientific research work in the Antarctic oasis region. Up to now, scientists from various countries have not conducted sufficient research on the reasons for the formation of Antarctic oases, and there are various theories.

After investigation and research, Richter believes that the hypotheses of Soviet scientists Avsyuk and Markov are the most accurate. They associate the formation of the oases with the climate and terrain of these coastal areas, where all rain and snow can melt and evaporate, while the ice and snow in the interior of Antarctica are difficult to reach these areas. Richter used the data he personally observed to confirm this argument and traced the main stages of the oasis's formation, from escaping ice cover to achieving maximum development.

Not long ago, ships of the "Slava" whaling fleet transported a group of Soviet scientists to Zavodovski Island, which had not been visited for more than 130 years. This volcanic island, located at 56 degrees 20 minutes south latitude and 27 degrees 35 minutes west longitude, was discovered in 1819 by the expedition organized by Russian navigators Bellingshausen and Lazarev. At that time, Zavodovsky and others from the expedition team first landed on this desolate island. Since then, no one has landed on this island.

Soviet scientists encountered great difficulties in landing on this island. They had to wade through bone-chilling seawater and then climb ashore. Instruments and hunting rifles were hoisted ashore with ropes.

Scientists discovered that Zavodovski Island is almost entirely covered with ice and snow. Only one place exposes the ground, where the soil temperature reaches 25 degrees Celsius. They believe this is due to underground volcanic activity. They found a species of lichen and a species of moss on the island, and also captured many penguins, petrels, dovekies, and other birds. Valuable specimens of Antarctic fish can also be caught on the coast of the island.

To commemorate this landing, Soviet scientists erected a four-meter-high metal marker adorned with a five-pointed star on the island and buried a sealed bottle containing a commemorative note beneath the marker. I (Attached Picture)

    苏联科学家经过长期考察研究
    找到南极绿洲形成原因
    重探扎瓦多夫岛发现一块没有冰雪的土地
    据新华社17日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联科学家最近在南极的科学考察工作中，又获得了一些值得注意的进展。
    苏联科学家里希特最近已经完成了南极绿洲地区的科学研究工作。到现在为止，世界各国科学家对南极绿洲形成的原因还没有足够的研究，存在各种各样的说法。
    里希特经过考察研究后认为，苏联科学家阿夫修克和马尔科夫等的假说最为准确。他们把绿洲的形成同沿岸这些地方的气候和地势联系起来，在这些地方雨雪全部能够融化和蒸发，而南极内部地区的冰雪却难于到达这些地方。里希特用他亲身观察到的资料证实了这个论点，并且追溯了绿洲在摆脱冰层的复盖一直到获得最大发展的各个主要形成阶段。
    不久前，“光荣”捕鲸船队的船只把一批苏联科学家送上了一百三十多年没有人到过的扎瓦多夫岛，这个位于南纬五十六度二十分、西经二十七度三十五分的火山岛，是在1819年被俄国航海家别林斯高晋和拉扎列夫组织的探险队发现的。当时，这个探险队的扎瓦多夫斯基等第一次登上了这个荒岛。从那个时候起，还没有任何人在这个岛上登陆过。
    苏联科学家登上这个海岛曾经遭到很大的困难。他们不得不涉过冷彻骨髓的海水再爬上岸去，仪器和猎枪都是用绳索吊上岸去的。
    科学家们发现，扎瓦多夫岛几乎全被冰雪复盖着。只有一个地方露着地面，那里的土壤温度达到零上二十五度。他们认为这是由于地下火山的活动造成的。他们在岛上发现了一种地衣类植物和一种苔藓类植物，并且还捕获了许多企鹅、海燕、海鸽和其他鸟类。在岛的海岸上还能捕到珍贵的南极鱼的标本。
    苏联科学家们为了纪念这次登陆，在岛上树立了一个四公尺高的饰有五角星的金属标记，并且在标记下面埋下了一个装着纪念笺的密闭瓶。I（附图片）
