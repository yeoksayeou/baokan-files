    Juxiangyuan's Almond Cakes
    The Juxiangyuan almond cakes, a specialty of Shiqi City, Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, sold very well both domestically and abroad last year. According to statistics, 500,000 of them were shipped to India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaya and other places for sale in the past year. In addition, a large quantity were sold domestically to Shanghai, Shenyang, Jiangxi, Henan, Shandong and other provinces and cities.
    The main ingredients used to make Juxiangyuan almond cakes are butter, shredded coconut, peanuts, egg yolks, fatty pork, sugar, and mung bean flour. Due to the high-quality ingredients and appropriate proportions, coupled with the special baking skills of the garden's technicians, the almond cakes produced are fragrant, sweet, and delicious. They melt in your mouth and leave a lingering fragrance on your teeth and cheeks, making them a historical gift of choice in the local area. Since the garden was founded forty years ago, it has been deeply welcomed by consumers at home and abroad. Since the joint public-private partnership last year, due to the expansion of equipment, improved business management, and the addition of 30 technicians, this year's output has reached 4 million, more than three times higher than before the joint venture. At the China Export Commodities Fair held in Guangzhou last year, foreign trade delegations ordered 320,000 of them. ·Cen Honglin·

    咀香园的杏仁饼
    广东省中山特产——石歧市咀香园杏仁饼，去年在国内外非常畅销。据统计一年来运到印度、印度尼西亚、新加坡、马来亚等地销售的即有五十万个。另有大量内销上海、沈阳、江西、河南、山东等省、市。
    咀香园杏仁饼制作的材料，主要是用奶油、椰蓉、花生、蛋黄、肥猪肉、砂糖、绿豆粉。由于选料好，配制份量得宜，加之该园技工有特别专长的焙饼技术，所以，制成的杏仁饼甘香味美，入嘴松化，食后颊齿留香，成为当地历史性的送礼佳品。自该园始创至今四十年以来，都深受国内外消费者欢迎。自去年公私合营以后，由于扩充设备，改善经营管理，增加了技工三十人，因而今年产量即高达四百万个，比合营前增加三倍多。去年在广州举行的中国出口商品交易会中，国外的贸易代表团就订购了三十二万个。　·岑鸿林·
