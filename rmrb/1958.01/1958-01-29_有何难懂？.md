    What's So Hard to Understand?
    French Foreign Minister Pineau, in a television program, discussed the issue of establishing American missile bases in France. He feigned innocence and said, "I don't understand why a launchpad located in France is more dangerous to France than one located in the Soviet Union."
    What's so hard to understand about that? The Soviet Union has no intention of attacking France, which many informed French people acknowledge. Therefore, Soviet missile launchpads do not pose a threat to France. However, if France transforms itself into an American missile base for attacking the Soviet Union, then in the event of war, France would inevitably become a target for retaliatory atomic missiles, which many informed French people foresee.
    What's incomprehensible is why the French Foreign Minister doesn't understand such a clear and easily understood principle.

    有何难懂？
    法国外交部长比诺在一次电视节目中谈到在法国设置美国导弹基地的问题。他假装天真地说：“我不懂，为什么设在法国的发射台比设在苏联的发射台对法国的危险大。”
    这有什么难懂呢？苏联并无进攻法国的意图，这是许多法国有识之士都承认的，所以苏联的导弹发射台并不构成对法国的威胁。但是如果法国把自己变成为美国进攻苏联的导弹基地，那末一旦发生战争，法国就不可免地会成为遭受反击的原子导弹靶子，这也是许多法国有识之士所预见到的。
    使人不懂的是，为什么法国外长连这样明白易懂的道理都不懂。
