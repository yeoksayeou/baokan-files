Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 22nd:  Party organizations at all levels in Guangdong Province are, with even fuller revolutionary vigor and greater revolutionary enthusiasm, further implementing the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the recent instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on resolutely and thoroughly opposing Rightist thought, striving for a great leap forward in production.

The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened provincial committee meetings and telephone conferences for secretaries of prefectural, municipal, and county committees on the 19th and 20th, respectively, to discuss how to resolutely implement the recent instructions of the Party Central Committee on thoroughly opposing Rightist thought. The provincial committee members and the secretaries of the nine prefectural committees and more than eighty municipal and county committees attending these two meetings excitedly listened to and discussed the central instructions and the provincial committee's opinions on how to promote current production with greater effort to implement the central instructions.

The provincial committee meeting on the 19th fully agreed with the central instructions. The meeting decided that the whole Party should break conventions and re-revise various production plans with 120,000 times the revolutionary zeal. At the telephone conference for prefectural, municipal, and county committee secretaries on the 20th, those present unanimously supported the central instructions and expressed full support for the provincial committee's determination. At this meeting, the provincial committee and the secretaries of the prefectural and municipal committees jointly made the decision to revise the targets of the grain and water conservancy plans and to double the task of completing water conservancy projects this year. The new targets proposed by this decision are:

(1) By 1962, the average grain yield per mu in the province should reach 800 jin, and the original target of 700 jin is abolished; this year, 33 counties (cities) must achieve a grain yield of 800 jin per mu. (2) The province must eliminate drought disasters within two years (drought resistance capacity of at least 40 days or more), and the original target of eliminating drought disasters in three to five years is abolished; 58 counties and cities must basically eliminate drought disasters before the spring plowing this year; 32 counties and cities must basically eliminate drought disasters before the autumn harvest this year, and the remaining 27 counties and cities must basically eliminate drought disasters this winter and next spring. (3) In order to complete this new target, the earthwork task of this year's water conservancy projects must be increased from the current 400 million cubic meters to 800 million cubic meters, and the benefited area must be increased from nearly 15 million mu to 20 million mu. The meeting also decided that while agricultural production is leaping forward again, industrial production and all work in the province must also leap forward at the same time, and a comprehensive revolutionary upsurge must be organized throughout the province in a very short period of time.

Profound lessons:
Rightist thought has caused serious consequences, and the experiences of success and failure in recent years are a testament to this.

Those who spoke at the two meetings all believed that as long as Rightist thought can be resolutely and thoroughly eradicated, the new targets can definitely be achieved. The experiences of success and failure in Guangdong Province in recent years also vividly prove this point. In recent years, whenever the Party organization has opposed Rightism, mustered up enthusiasm, and become a revolutionary promoter, the leadership has gone deeper, has been able to meet the wishes of the masses, and has been able to fully rely on and mobilize the masses. At this time, the greatest difficulties can be overcome, miracles will continue to emerge, and the social outlook will be renewed. Taking the situation in 1956 and 1957 as an example: in both years, the investment in water conservancy was 30 million yuan. In 1956, the enthusiasm was high, and 10 million mu of water conservancy were built; in 1957, the enthusiasm was low, and only 5 million mu of water conservancy were built. In 1956, the rainfall and climate were worse than in 1957, and there was a severe drought that had not been seen in decades. Moreover, the agricultural cooperatives had just been established. However, the Party organization's enthusiasm was high, and the people did work in a few months that would have taken many years in the past. Never in the history of Guangdong Province had the peasants of that era exerted such great power. The drought was overcome, and the province achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, increasing grain production by 2 billion jin. Cadres and the masses were satisfied, and all work was proactive. In 1957, most areas of Guangdong Province were basically blessed with good weather, and with the foundation of increased income and cooperative management in 1956, production should have seen a great development and a bumper harvest. However, the Party organization was affected by the countercurrent of Rightist thought, and those cadres and masses who had revolutionary enthusiasm could not hold their heads high. The entire production appeared lackluster, the enthusiasm was low, the leadership in many places drifted, the increase in production was very small, the masses had opinions, and all work was passive. This comparison between 1956 and 1957 vividly illustrates the serious consequences that Rightist thought has brought to work and the people. This lesson is very profound.

At the meeting, the facts of the winter production movement that is currently developing were also cited to illustrate the significance of thoroughly opposing Rightism. When the movement began, the masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, had a great enthusiasm for engaging in winter production after the great debate in the countryside. However, many middle-level leading cadres were Rightist in their thinking and underestimated the enthusiasm of the masses. When leading winter production, they did not dare to let go. Although the movement started much better than in the winter of 1956, the progress was still slow and the scale was still not large enough. Later, after the provincial and county Party congresses were held, a great debate was conducted on the instructions of the Third Plenary Session, opposing Rightist thought, mustering up enthusiasm, and boldly mobilizing the masses. Once the enthusiasm of the masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, received strong support from the leadership, a vigorous winter production upsurge centered on water conservancy construction rapidly formed. The scale, efficiency, progress, and quality of this movement, as well as its attention to comprehensive production, were not only incomparable to the Rightist period of the winter of 1956, but were also inferior to the famous winter upsurge of 1955. In mid-January, the number of people participating in winter production reached nearly 15 million, and the attendance rate remained above 90%. Many places worked day and night, and various winter production targets were broken layer by layer, often breaking through. Leading organs in various places all said that many things that they had never dared to think of in the past were accomplished at once. The benefited area of winter water conservancy (including the projects in the spring of 1958) was originally planned to be 5 million mu, and everyone was worried about not being able to complete it. Later, it was increased to 10 million mu, then to 15 million mu, and now it has been increased to 20 million mu. Now, just over a month has passed since the large-scale start of work (the winter water conservancy project time in Guangdong Province is only two or three months), and 6.64 million mu have been completed, which is more than 1.6 million mu more than all water conservancy projects from the winter of 1956 to the spring of 1957. It is estimated that the 20 million mu of water conservancy projects completed this entire winter will exceed three times the winter projects of 1956, one time the winter water conservancy projects of 1955, and equal the total of water conservancy projects built since liberation. While farmers in Guangdong Province are rushing to repair water conservancy projects with such great force, they have also accumulated nearly 2 billion dan of fertilizer, which is equal to the total amount of fertilizer accumulated in the entire winter of 1955, and improved 3 million mu of soil.

Always cannot be conservative:
The backward must compare with the advanced, and the advanced must compare with the more advanced.

The meeting, according to the recent instructions of the Party Central Committee, further examined the current guiding ideology, and affirmed that Rightist thought still exists in the Party committees at all levels, and the revolutionary vigor and revolutionary enthusiasm have not yet reached the point of twelve points. This is mainly reflected in many issues of rural work. Under the same conditions, many Party committees have not adopted revolutionary measures to learn from the most advanced and are determined to surpass them. There is a lack of revolutionary heroism and revolutionary spirit. For example, in this winter's water conservancy project, Qingyuan County, with a population of 500,000, dared to formulate a plan to build 21 million cubic meters of earthwork, and has completed 9 million cubic meters by using 140,000 people to attack day and night. However, the ten counties in the Gaoyao Prefecture, with a population of nearly 3 million, originally planned to build only more than 30 million cubic meters of earthwork. The leading ideology of the Party committees at all levels in Gaoyao Prefecture is obviously conservative, and the potential for water conservancy construction is definitely very large.

The provincial committee meeting has repeatedly asked everyone to compare with Anhui Province. Anhui Province has more than 20 million agricultural population, and has done 1.4 billion cubic meters of water conservancy earthwork in two months. Guangdong Province has 30 million agricultural population, and has only done 250 million cubic meters of water conservancy earthwork in more than one month. Those who participated in these two meetings pointed out that the backward places in Guangdong Province are conservative and Rightist compared with the advanced places, and the more advanced places in Guangdong Province are still conservative and Rightist compared with the more advanced places in other provinces. In addition, the provincial committee believes that some places have underestimated the standards for calculating drought resistance capacity; they like to engage in large-scale water conservancy and ignore small-scale water conservancy; some Party committees have not focused on water conservancy prominently; and individual places have unreasonably wasted water conservancy funds, using water conservancy funds to buy bicycles, loudspeakers, etc., all of which are the reason for Rightist thought there. These Rightist thoughts should be immediately organized for a great debate to thoroughly eliminate them, so that the leading ideology can keep up with the advanced and keep up with the movement.

These two meetings made many specific arrangements to ensure the realization of new plans and new targets. Among them, three items were focused on: winter water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and changing leadership methods. In terms of water conservancy, the task of 800 million cubic meters of earthwork must be completed this year in order to eliminate drought disasters within two years. Of the 800 million cubic meters of earthwork, more than 150 million cubic meters can be arranged after the Spring Festival, using the method of overall planning, starting work year-round, and doing it whenever there is free time. The remaining 650 million cubic meters of earthwork (250 million cubic meters have been completed) must be strived to be completed before the Spring Festival with the spirit of desperate work, by building more small-scale water conservancy projects, improving labor efficiency, and sending more reinforcements. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, it is required to accumulate another 2 billion dan of fertilizer by the Spring Festival. In terms of improving leadership methods, the provincial committee decided to vigorously learn from the experience of Hong'an County, Hubei Province. Within one month, each county must establish a demonstration farm near the county seat, each township and community cadre must have their own demonstration fields, and they must also learn the method of supporting and promoting advanced experiences, especially the responsible cadres of the prefectural and county committees, who must personally go deep into the construction sites, townships, and communities to discover advanced units and regions, help them summarize, and promote their experiences.

    坚决彻底地反掉右倾思想
    广东以十二万分的革命干劲，打破常规，修订计划
    五年内全省亩产达八百斤，两年消灭旱灾，今年水利增加一倍
    工业生产和所有工作同时跃进，迅速组织起全面的革命高涨
    新华社广州22日电　中共广东省各级组织，正以更饱满的革命朝气和更大的革命干劲，进一步执行中共八届三中全会的决议以及中共中央最近有关坚决彻底地反掉右倾思想的指示，力争生产的大跃进。
    中共广东省委在19日和20日分别召开了省委会议和地、市、县委书记电话会议，讨论如何坚决贯彻最近党中央有关彻底反掉右倾的指示。到会的省委委员以及九个地委、八十多个市、县委的书记，在这两次会议上兴奋地听取和讨论了中央的指示以及省委为了贯彻中央指示如何以更大的劲头来推进当前生产的意见。
    19日的省委会议，完全同意中央的指示。会议决定全党要以十二万分的革命干劲，打破常规，重新修订各项生产计划。20日的地、市、县委书记电话会议上，到会的人一致拥护中央的指示，对省委的决心表示完全支持。就在这个会上，省委和地、市委书记们共同作出了修改粮食和水利两个计划指标，把今年完成水利工程的任务增加一倍的决定。这个决定提出的新的指标是：
  （1）到1962年全省达到每亩粮食平均产量八百斤，原定的七百斤的指标作废；今年就要有三十三个县（市）达到亩产粮食八百斤。（2）全省要在两年内消灭旱灾（抗旱能力至少在四十天以上），原定消灭旱灾要用三年到五年的指标作废；五十八个县、市在今年春耕之前要基本上消灭旱灾；三十二县、市在今年秋收前基本上消灭旱灾，剩下的二十七个县市在今冬明春基本消灭旱灾。（3）为了完成这个新指标，今年水利工程土方任务，必须由目前的四亿方增加到八亿方，受益面积由近一千五百万亩增加到二千万亩。会议还决定在农业生产实行跃进再跃进的时候，全省的工业生产及所有工作都必须同时跃进，在极短时间内，组织起一个全省范围的全面的革命高涨。深刻的教训：
    右倾思想造成了严重后果，几年来成功和失败的经历就是见证。
    在两个会议上发言的人，都认为只要能够坚决地彻底地肃清右倾思想，新的指标是肯定能够实现的。广东省几年来成功和失败的经历，也活生生地证明了这一点。几年来，凡是党组织反掉右倾、鼓足干劲、变成革命促进派的时候，领导就随之深入，就能够满足群众的愿望，也就能充分依靠和发动群众。这时，天大的困难便能克服，奇迹便会不断涌现出来，社会面貌便为之一新。以1956年和1957年的情况为例：这两年水利投资都是三千万元，1956年干劲大，修了水利一千万亩；1957年干劲小，水利只修了五百万亩。1956年雨水、气候比1957年还差，碰到了几十年不见的大旱灾，农业社又是刚刚办起来，可是党组织的干劲大，人民在几个月内做了以往许多年才做到的工作，广东省历史上从来没有那个时代的农民发挥过那么大的威力，旱灾被战胜了，全省获得空前大丰收，增产粮食达二十亿斤，干部群众都满意，一切工作都主动。1957年，广东省大部地区基本上算风调雨顺，有1956年增收和办社的底子，生产应该来个大发展、大丰收，可是党组织受到右倾的逆流的影响，干部和群众中有革命干劲的人抬不起头来，整个生产便显得暮气沉沉，干劲小，不少地方领导自流，增产很少，群众有意见，所有工作被动。1956年和1957年的这个对比，生动地说明了右倾思想给工作给人民带来了严重的后果。这个教训是很深的。
    会议上，还举出目前正在发展着的冬季大生产运动的事实，来说明彻底反掉右倾的意义。运动开始时，正是农村经过大辩论以后，群众尤其贫苦农民群众要求搞冬季生产的劲头很大，但是不少中层领导干部思想右倾，把群众的积极性估计得太低，领导冬季生产时，不敢大放手，运动一开始虽比1956年冬好得多，但进度仍然较慢，规模仍然不够大。以后开过省、县党代大会，就三中全会指示作了大辩论，反掉右倾思想，鼓足干劲，大放手地发动群众，群众尤其贫苦农民群众的积极性一旦得到领导的大力支持，一个轰轰烈烈的以兴修水利为中心的冬季生产高潮便急速地形成了。这个运动的规模之大，效率之高，进度之快，质量之好，而且在兼顾全面生产等方面，不仅为右倾时期的1956年冬季所不能比拟，就是著名的1955年冬季的大高潮也逊色许多。1月中旬参加冬季生产的人数达到近一千五百万人，出勤率始终保持在90％以上，不少地方昼夜开工，各种冬季生产指标都是层层突破、常常突破，各地领导机关都说，许多以往想都不敢想的事一下子就办到了。冬修水利（包括1958年春天工程在内）受益面积，原计划五百万亩，大家还担心完不成，后增到一千万亩，再增到一千五百万亩，现又增加到二千万亩。现在只刚刚大开工一个多月（广东省冬修工程时间只有两三个月），已完成六百六十四万亩，比1956年冬季到1957年春季所有水利工程还超过一百六十万亩。今年整个冬季预计完成的二千万亩水利工程，更超过1956年冬季工程的三倍，超过1955年冬季水利工程的一倍，等于解放以来兴建水利工程的总和。广东省农民用这么大的力量抢修水利工程的时候，还积肥近二十亿担，等于1955年整个冬季积肥的总数；改良了土壤三百万亩。始终不能保守：
  后进的要同先进的比，先进的要同更先进的比。
    会议根据党中央最近的指示，进一步检查了目前的领导思想，肯定各级党委仍然存在着右倾思想，革命朝气、革命干劲还没有大到十二分的地步。这主要表现在农村工作的许多问题上，不少党委在同等条件下，没有采取革命措施向最先进的看齐，并且下决心超过它。缺少一种革命英雄主义和革命气魄。譬如今冬水利工程，清远县一个县五十万人口，敢于制订一个兴修二千一百万土方的工程计划，用十四万人昼夜突击，已经完成九百万方，但是高要专区十个县将近三百万人口，原计划也只修三千多万土方的工程。高要专区各级党委的领导思想显然是保守的，兴修水利的潜力肯定是很大的。
    省委会议曾几次要求大家同安徽省比较。安徽省二千多万农业人口，两个月做了十四亿水利土石方工程，广东省三千万农业人口，一个多月只做了二亿五千万方水利工程。参加这两次会议的人都指出，广东省后进的地方同先进的地方比较是保守右倾，广东省先进些的地方同外省更先进的地方比还是保守右倾。此外，省委认为，有些地方计算抗旱能力标准时偏低；喜欢搞大型水利，忽视小型水利；有些党委抓水利抓得不突出；个别地方无理浪费水利拨款，用水利拨款买自行车、扩音机等，都是右倾思想在那里作怪的缘故。对这些右倾思想，都应该立刻组织大辩论，把它彻底肃清，使领导思想跟上先进，跟上运动。
    这两次会议都作了许多具体安排，来保证实现新计划新指标。其中，着重地安排了冬季水利、积肥和改变领导方法三个项目。水利方面，今年必须完成八亿土方的任务，才可能在两年内消灭旱灾。八亿土方任务中，有一亿五千多万土方可以安排在春节以后，用全面规划、常年动手、有空就搞的方法去进行。其余的六亿五千万土方（已完成二亿五千万土方），一定要用拼命干的精神，用多修小水利，提高劳动效率，增派援军的方法，争取在春节前突击完成。积肥方面，要求到春节再积肥二十亿担。改善领导方法方面，省委决定大力学习湖北省红安县的经验，一个月内每个县一定要在县城附近办起一个示范农场，每个乡、社干部一定要有自己的示范田，还要学会支持并推广先进经验的办法，特别是地委和县委负责干部，一定要亲自深入工地，深入乡、社，发现先进的单位和地区，帮助他们总结，并把他们的经验加以推广。
