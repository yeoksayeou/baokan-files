Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 20th - The works of outstanding American realist painter Rockwell Kent have aroused widespread interest in Moscow. The Kent exhibition recently held at the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts was a great success. The "Pravda" newspaper on the 17th devoted nearly half a page to publishing a conversation that the painter had with its special correspondent in Chicago.

Rockwell Kent is an American progressive painter. He is good at painting landscapes, creating a large number of landscape paintings about northern America, Newfoundland, Alaska, and Greenland with realistic techniques and bright and simple colors. In addition, he also created some lithographs, woodcuts, book and newspaper illustrations, etc.

The Kent exhibition, organized by the Soviet Union's Foreign Cultural Association, exhibited many oil paintings and ink paintings created by the painter, which reflected the painter's brilliant talent and love for life.

"Pravda," in discussing this exhibition, emphasized that this realist painter lives and works under difficult conditions in the United States, where various formalist schools dominate, established to suit the tastes of the bourgeoisie and to detach Americans from real life. "Pravda" pointed out that Kent's works are widely welcomed by the broad masses of the American people. The painter did not shut himself in an "ivory tower"; at the same time, he also used the pen of a painter and politician, and inspiring language, to engage in the struggle to defend peace.

    美国杰出的现实主义画家
    肯特作品在莫斯科展出
    新华社莫斯科20日电　美国杰出的现实主义画家罗克威尔·肯特的作品在莫斯科引起了普遍的兴趣，最近在普希金造型艺术博物馆举行的肯特作品展览会，获得了很大成功。“真理报”17日以将近半版的篇幅刊载了这位画家在芝加哥对它的特派记者发表的谈话。
    罗克威尔·肯特是美国进步画家，他擅长画风景，以现实主义手法和明朗而朴实的色彩创作了大量关于美国北部、纽芬兰、阿拉斯加、格陵兰的风景画。此外他还创作了一些石版画、木刻、书报插图等等。
    由苏联对外文化协会举办的这次肯特作品展览会展出了这位画家创作的油画、彩墨画多幅，这些绘画反映出了画家的光辉天才和对生活的热爱。
    “真理报”在谈到这次展览会时着重指出，这位现实主义画家是在美国的困难条件下生活和劳动的，那里占统治地位的是为适合资产阶级胃口而建立的和用来使美国人脱离现实生活的各种各样的形式主义流派。“真理报”指出，肯特的作品受到美国广大阶层人民的广泛欢迎。这位画家没有使自己关在“象牙之塔”里，他同时还以画家和政治家的笔杆、以鼓舞人心的语言从事着保卫和平的斗争。
