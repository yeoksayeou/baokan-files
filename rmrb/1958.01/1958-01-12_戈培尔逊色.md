    Goebbels Pales in Comparison
    If Goebbels were still alive, he would definitely have to apprentice himself to Dulles to learn his unique ability to tell lies with his eyes closed.
    Each of Dulles's press conferences is a brilliant display of this "signature skill." One can extract any casual remark of his and make Goebbels feel ashamed of his inferiority. For example, at the press conference on the 10th, someone asked him: "In the movement to strive for peace, we have been reacting to the Russians instead of prompting them to react to us. Do we have any plans to take the initiative?" Dulles replied: "The Soviet proposals are completely empty. Our proposals have content and represent initiative."

    戈培尔逊色
    如果戈培尔还在世，他一定得拜杜勒斯为师，来学习他的闭着眼睛说瞎话的独到本领。
    杜勒斯的每一次记者招待会，都是他的这种“看家本领”的一次精彩表现。人们抽出他的随便一句话，都可以使戈培尔自愧不如。例如在10日的记者招待会上，有人问他：“我们在争取和平的运动中一直在向俄国人反应而不是促使他们向我们反应。我们是否有采取主动的任何计划？”杜勒斯在回答中说：“苏联的建议是完全空空洞洞的。我们的建议才有内容，代表了主动性。”
