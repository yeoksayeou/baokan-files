In the southern provinces, the handmade paper industry mostly uses bamboo for pulping. Due to rudimentary equipment and shortcomings in management, raw materials are consumed excessively, and the fiber recovery rate is very low. According to a survey in Jiangxi Province, producing one ton of handmade bamboo pulp requires nine to eleven tons of bamboo, about twice as much as a machine-made paper mill. Handmade bamboo pulp is of relatively low quality. If it is used in machine-made paper mills, it needs to be processed, and the refined pulp recovery rate is only 60% to 70%. Therefore, it is very uneconomical from the perspective of saving national resources for the handmade paper industry to use bamboo for pulping.

From the perspective of bamboo supply, there are also problems with the handmade paper industry using bamboo for pulping. Although bamboo is an annual plant and easier to cultivate than trees, because China's timber resources are insufficient, basic construction departments, mechanical papermaking industrial departments, and handicraft production cooperatives that manufacture furniture must use bamboo instead of wood as much as possible. Therefore, bamboo still cannot meet the ever-increasing needs of all parties. In recent years, some handicraft cooperatives and handmade paper cooperatives (groups) that use bamboo as raw material have had their production development restricted due to insufficient bamboo supply. In the future, all parties will need more bamboo, and if the handmade paper industry does not actively research and utilize new raw materials, the development of production will be greatly affected.

Using rice straw for pulping is a direction for development. The southern provinces, where the handmade paper industry is relatively developed, have a large amount of rice straw. Rice straw comes from rural areas, and the handmade paper industry is also scattered in small towns or rural areas, so it can take materials locally, which not only guarantees the supply of raw materials but also saves transportation costs. The technology of rice straw pulping is also relatively simple. In terms of cost, handmade paper production cooperatives (groups) need 650 to 700 yuan to produce one ton of bamboo pulp, while only 380 to 400 yuan is needed to produce one ton of rice straw pulp. Therefore, no matter from which aspect, it is most appropriate for the handmade paper industry to use rice straw for pulping.

From the perspective of paper quality, the results of trials in various places have proved that as long as the characteristics of rice straw are mastered, and preparation work such as combing the straw, cutting the ears, removing the roots, and beating the straw is carried out, the finished product can meet the quality requirements of handmade paper. If the technical conditions are not good, and it is temporarily impossible to use all straw pulp, it can also be used in appropriate proportions. As early as September 1956, Tonggu County, Jiangxi Province, mixed 40% straw pulp to make rough-edged paper, and the product quality was exactly the same as that made of all bamboo pulp, but the cost was 8.41% lower.

    推广稻草造浆
    胡道源
    南方各省的手工造纸业，大都用竹子造浆。由于设备简陋，管理工作有缺点，耗费原料多，纤维收获率很低。据江西省调查，制一吨手工竹浆要用九至十一吨竹子，比机制纸厂多一倍左右。手工竹浆质量比较低，如果拿到机制纸厂使用，还要加工，精浆收获率只有60％至70％。因此，手工造纸业利用竹子造浆，从节约国家资源方面说，是很不合算的。
    从竹子供应的情况来看，手工造纸用竹子造浆也有问题。虽说竹子是一年生植物，比树木容易培植，但因我国木材资源不足，基本建设部门、机械造纸工业部门和制造家具的手工业生产合作社，都要尽可能地使用竹子代替木材，所以竹子仍然不能满足各方面日益增长的需要。近年来，有些用竹子做原料的手工业合作社和手工造纸合作社（组），都因竹子供应不足，使生产的发展受到了限制。今后各方面对竹子的需要将更多，手工造纸业如果不积极研究利用新的原料，生产的发展将会受到更大的影响。
    利用稻草造浆是一个发展方向。手工造纸业比较发达的南方各省，都有大量稻草。稻草出在农村，手工造纸业也分散在小城镇或农村，可以就地取材，既保证原料供应，又节省运输费用。稻草造浆的技术也比较简单。就成本来说，手工纸生产社（组）造一吨竹浆，要六百五十至七百元，而造一吨稻草浆，只要三百八十至四百元。因此，无论从那方面来讲，手工造纸业采用稻草造浆，是最合适的。
    从纸的质量来看，各地试用的结果证明，只要掌握了稻草的特性，进行梳草、切穗、除根、打草等备料工作，制出的成品可以符合手工纸的质量要求。假如因技术条件不好，暂时还不能全部使用草浆，也可以适当搭配使用。江西省铜鼓县早在1956年9月就掺用40％的草浆制毛边纸，产品质量完全跟全竹浆制的一样，而成本要低8.41％。
