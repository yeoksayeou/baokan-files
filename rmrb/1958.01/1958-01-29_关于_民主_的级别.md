On the Levels of "Democracy"
Xiao Li

After the rectification campaign, the criticism and self-criticism within the people, especially the criticism of leaders by the masses, has made a great leap forward. This is a great development of socialist democracy. However, the fundamental reason why such a great development can occur lies in the fact that our democratic system is advanced. If power were only held in the hands of a few exploiters, no matter how you carry out rectification, it would not develop into democracy for the entire people. Therefore, I am reminded of the short article "'Worries of 'Party Intellectuals'" (People's Daily, May 10, 1957). According to the author, it was a "feeling" after reading "Beijing Letters" (Wenhui Daily, May 3, 1957); in fact, this "feeling" was greatly deceived.

The purpose of "Beijing Letters" was to exaggerate the "worries of Party intellectuals" to stimulate others to "stand up," and Comrade Li Yue, after being "stimulated," called on people to "rebel." Although the "rebellion" mentioned by Li Yue was only the dogmatists "criticizing yesterday's old self with today's new self," and the purpose of the "attack" was only to "put dogmatism to death," since he regarded the rightists' attack on the Party as opposition to dogmatism and spread it accordingly, he inevitably played a supporting role objectively. I am afraid that even Comrade Li Yue has already realized this.

I think that "being deceived" is not important, because the above-mentioned negative effects have long been eliminated through the struggle against the rightists. What is important is to find out the reasons for "being deceived" and eliminate them. This reason lies in that article.

Let us first see what Comrade Li Yue felt: "Many comrades had the courage to fight for democracy in undemocratic times, and even if they 'fought' until their heads were broken and bleeding, they had no worries. But in today's era of won democracy, they lack the courage to enjoy democracy, worrying about this and worrying about that."

So, what kind of democracy does Comrade Li Yue want to enjoy? It is said that it includes "developing democracy and seeking more complete and higher-level democracy." This makes people a little confused. It is of course easy to understand to say that we still need to "develop democracy" or that we still need to seek a "more complete" "development" of socialist democracy, but what does "seeking higher-level democracy" mean? If we say that "democracy" has levels in terms of its nature, then is socialist democracy not the highest level in China today? Can there be any democracy that is higher than this today? There are two possible interpretations of the "higher-level democracy" argument: one is democracy after the elimination of class antagonism. This is certainly more advanced than democracy under conditions of class antagonism; however, when class antagonism still exists today, demanding the realization of a democracy in which all classes are equally treated only benefits the restoration of capitalism. Saying this is a utopian "left" is not as accurate as saying it is a substantive right. During that period, some bourgeois rightists were using the guise of "higher-level democracy" to replace socialist democracy with bourgeois democracy.

However, Comrade Li Yue has given an example: "Criticism and self-criticism are important contents of today's democratic life, and also a struggle within the people. Compared with the struggle against the enemy, this kind of struggle is often more complex, more meticulous, and sometimes even more difficult. Some comrades who dare to brave the enemy's artillery fire, but shrink back at the checkpoint of criticism and self-criticism."

It seems that Comrade Li Yue may regard "criticism and self-criticism" as one of the contents of "higher-level democracy." In this way, it seems that democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat also has high and low distinctions. The development of criticism and self-criticism is advanced; otherwise, it is low-level. If this is really the case, then confusion is no longer confusion, but the mistake becomes even more obvious.

First, whether "democracy is advanced" or not does not depend on "criticism and self-criticism," but mainly on the class essence of democracy, that is, whether power belongs to the majority or the minority; whether it belongs to the laborers or the exploiters? The former is advanced, and the latter is low-level.

Second, it is true to say that carrying out criticism and self-criticism within the people, especially the criticism of leaders by the masses, is in a sense more meticulous and complex than the struggle against the enemy, and therefore may have certain difficulties in certain situations; but it is wrong to say that this is "more difficult" than the struggle against the enemy. Have you ever seen anyone being executed for carrying out criticism within the people? This exposes a fundamentally wrong view of Comrade Li Yue, that is, he believes that the reason why democracy is not fully developed in our society is mainly because many leaders do not like criticism, and that overcoming this difficulty is very "difficult." However, how can the style of the "leaders" cover up the superiority of the system?

The rectification has proven to us the reasons why criticism and self-criticism were not sufficiently developed in the past, that is, socialist democracy was not fully promoted enough: on the one hand, in the minds of the majority of people, they sometimes cannot distinguish between two different types of contradictions, especially lacking correct understanding and correct methods for resolving contradictions among the people; on the other hand, there are problems of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism in the general leading cadres. It is not because the current democracy itself is low-level. Therefore, the solution is to solve the above problems through rectification, and rectification is indeed solving and has solved these problems. It is not about "seeking higher-level democracy."

### 关于“民主”的级别

    关于“民主”的级别
    萧理
    经过整风运动，人民内部的批评和自我批评，特别是群众对领导者的批评，有了一个大跃进，这是社会主义民主的一个大发展，然而，之所以能有这样一个大发展，其根本原因，又在于我们的民主制度是先进的；权力倘只握在少数剥削者手中，任你怎样整风，也发展不成全体人民的民主的。于是，我想起“‘党内知识分子’的顾虑”（1957年5月10日人民日报）那篇短文来，据作者说，它是“北京书简”（1957年5月3日文汇报）的读后感；其实，这“感触”是上了大当的。
    “北京书简”的目的，是用夸大“党内知识分子顾虑”的方法，来刺激别人“挺身而出”，而李跃同志便在“刺激”之后号召人们“反戈一击”。虽然，李跃所说的“反戈”，还只是教条主义者“以今天的新我来批判昨天的旧我”；“一击”的目的，也还只是“制教条主义于死命”，然而，他既然把右派分子的向党进攻，看作是反对教条主义，并转而为之传布，也就不免在客观上起了策应的作用。这一点，怕连李跃同志也已觉悟到了的吧。
    我以为，“上当”也还不要紧，因为上述不良作用，经过反右派的斗争，是早已涤除了的。重要的是要找出所以“上当”的原因来加以消除。这原因也便就在那文章中。
    我们先来看看李跃同志所感触的是些什么：“不少同志在不民主的时代有争取民主的勇气，即使‘争’得头破血流，也没有什么顾虑，可是在争得了民主的今天，他们反而缺乏享受民主的勇气，顾虑这，顾虑那。”
    那末，李跃同志所要享受的民主又是什么呢？据说就是“包括发展民主，求得更充分、更高级的民主在内”。这就使人有些糊涂。说还要“发展民主”，或者说还要求得社会主义民主“更充分”的“发展”这当然容易理解，可是“求得更高级的民主”是什么意思呢？倘说，以性质来区别，“民主”是有级别的话，难道社会主义民主，在当前的中国来说，还不是最高级的吗？难道今天还能有什么比这更高级的民主吗？关于“更高级民主”的说法，可以有两种：一种是阶级对立消除以后的民主。这当然比有着阶级对立情况下的民主要更高级；但是，当阶级对立还存在的今天，就要求实现一种各阶级一律平等的民主，却只对于资本主义的复辟有利，说这是一种空想的“左”，还不如说这是一种实质的右。那个时期，有些资产阶级右派分子正是在“更高级的民主”的幌子下，要用资产阶级民主来代替社会主义民主的。
    然而，李跃同志是有所举例的：“批评自我批评是今天民主生活的重要内容之一，同时也是人民内部的斗争。这种斗争，跟对敌斗争比较起来，往往更复杂，更细致，有时甚至更艰难。有些敢于冒着敌人的炮火的同志，却在批评和自我批评这个关口面前却步了”。
    看来，李跃同志也许是把“批评自我批评”看作“更高级的民主”内容之一的。这样一来，似乎无产阶级专政条件下的民主，也有了高级和低级的分别，批评和自我批评发展的是高级的；否则是低级的。果真如此，糊涂是不糊涂了，但错误也就越加明显。
    第一，“民主的高级”与否，并不决定于“批评自我批评”，而主要决定于民主的阶级实质，也就是说权力是属于多数人的呢，还是少数人的；是属于劳动者的呢，还是剥削者的？是前者就是高级的，后者就是低级的。
    第二，倘说在人民内部开展批评自我批评，特别是人民群众对领导者的批评，在某种意义上讲，比对敌斗争更细致更复杂，因而在某种情况下也有一定困难，也是对的；但说这比对敌斗争“更艰难”，就是错误的。可曾见过因为开展人民内部批评被处死的吗？这里暴露了李跃同志的一个根本错误的看法，就是他认为我们这社会的民主发扬得不够，主要是因为许多领导者不喜欢批评，而且认为要克服这个困难是很“艰难”的。然而，“领导者”的作风又如何能掩尽制度的优越性呢？
    整风已向我们证明了以前批评自我批评不够发展、也就是社会主义民主发扬得还不够的原因：一则在于在多数人的头脑里有时对两种性质不同的矛盾，分辨不清，特别是对人民内部矛盾的解决缺乏正确的理解和正确的方法；一则在于在一般领导干部的身上存在有主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义的毛病。而并不是由于现在的民主的本身是低级的。因而解决的办法就是通过整风来解决上述问题，整风也确实解决着和解决了这些问题。并不是什么“求得更高级的民主”了。
