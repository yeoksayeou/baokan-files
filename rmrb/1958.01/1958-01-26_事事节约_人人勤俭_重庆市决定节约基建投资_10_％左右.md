Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 25th: The Basic Construction and Transportation Work Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on last year's experience in saving on capital construction investment, has formulated specific measures for implementing the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift this year. It requires all capital construction units in the city to save approximately 10% on capital construction investment this year, on the basis of already determined investments and projects, while ensuring quality.

The Basic Construction and Transportation Work Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to adopt the following measures to implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift: To list "hard struggle, building the country through diligence and thrift" as one of the important contents of socialist education, and to implement the thought of running enterprises through diligence and thrift into every project and every employee. Regularly check the use of investment, resolutely reduce projects that can be avoided or postponed, and lower construction standards, especially the construction standards of non-productive buildings. Vigorously reduce non-productive construction and decide that this year no new office buildings, auditoriums, clubs, ice skating rinks, swimming pools, guesthouses, sanatoriums, indoor courts and other buildings will be built. When considering new construction projects, priority should be given to how to fully utilize the potential of existing equipment, and the policy of combining large, medium, and small, and combining new and old should be implemented. At present, the auxiliary workshops of various factories in Chongqing, the practice factories and laboratories of universities and technical schools, and the technical schools and cadre schools of various systems generally have a low utilization rate, so we should vigorously organize cooperation and exert potential to reduce future investment in this area. In terms of design, it is required to improve the design level, to design reasonable buildings for the country more, faster, better, and more economically, and to develop more affordable standard drawings for civil buildings. In terms of construction, it is required to complete capital construction tasks ahead of schedule in accordance with the comprehensive policy of more, faster, better and more economical. At the same time, it is prepared to establish a general Party A and a general Party B within the municipal system to eliminate the waste caused by the lack of coordination and mutual constraints in various links of capital construction.

The Municipal Party Committee’s Basic Construction and Transportation Work Department pointed out that the potential for Chongqing to save on capital construction investment exists. First of all, through the rectification movement, the political and ideological awareness of all employees has been greatly improved, and the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift has been further deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The broad masses of employees will more consciously implement all saving measures. Secondly, there is still a certain difference between this year's design budget and the construction budget based on the construction drawings. There are still unnecessary items that can be reduced in the design, and there are still excessively high standards that can be lowered. For example, the construction budget for the expansion project of Chongqing Power Plant, which was carefully calculated jointly by the plant and the construction department, saved more than 2.2 million yuan compared with the design budget, accounting for 19.46% of the total investment. Third, last year, various units in Chongqing, according to the instructions of Comrades Li Fuchun and Bo Yibo, twice checked the use of capital construction funds and gained experience in plugging loopholes in waste.

    事事节约　人人勤俭
    重庆市决定节约基建投资10％左右
    据新华社重庆25日电　中共重庆市委基本建设交通工作部，根据去年节约基本建设投资的经验，制定今年贯彻勤俭建国方针的具体措施，要求全市各基本建设单位在保证质量的原则下，在已经确定了的投资和项目的基础上，今年节约基本建设投资10％左右。
    中共重庆市委基本建设交通工作部决定采取下列措施来贯彻勤俭建国方针：把“艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国”列为社会主义教育的重要内容之一，把勤俭办企业的思想贯彻到每一项工程和每一个职工当中去。定期检查投资使用情况，坚决削减可以不建或可以缓建的项目，降低建筑标准，特别是非生产性建筑的建筑标准。大力紧缩非生产性建筑，决定今年一律不新建办公楼、礼堂、俱乐部、溜冰场、游泳池、招待所、疗养院、室内球场等建筑物。在考虑新的建设项目时，应首先考虑如何充分发挥现有设备潜力，贯彻大、中、小结合，新旧结合的方针。现在重庆市各厂的辅助车间，大专学校和技工学校的实习工厂和实验室，各系统的技工学校和干部学校，一般利用率还很低，因此应大力组织协作，发挥潜力，以减少今后在这方面的投资。在设计方面，要求提高设计水平，为国家更多、更快、更好、更省地设计出合理的建筑物，制定造价更为低廉的民用建筑标准图。施工方面要求按多、快、好、省的全面方针，按期提前完成基本建设任务。同时准备在市属系统内成立总甲方和总乙方，以消除基本建设中各个环节不相协调，互相掣肘所造成的浪费现象。
    市委基建交通工作部指出，重庆市节约基本建设投资的潜力是存在的。首先是通过整风运动，全体职工政治上、思想上的觉悟已大大提高一步，勤俭建国的方针已进一步深入人心，广大职工更会自觉地贯彻一切节约措施。其次，今年的设计概算和根据施工图纸作出的施工预算之间，仍有一定的差额，设计上还有不必要的项目可以削减，还有过高的标准可以降低。例如重庆发电厂和施工部门共同精打细算作出的扩建工程施工预算，同设计概算比较，就节约投资二百二十万元以上，占总投资的19.46％。第三，去年重庆市各单位曾经根据李富春、薄一波同志的指示，两次检查了基建资金的使用情况，并且取得了堵塞浪费漏洞的经验。
