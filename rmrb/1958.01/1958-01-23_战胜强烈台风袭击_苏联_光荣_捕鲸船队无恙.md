Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: According to TASS, the Soviet "Glory" whaling fleet recently overcame the strongest typhoon it has encountered in over a decade in the Antarctic, with no crew fatalities.

On January 17th, while the Soviet "Glory" whaling fleet was whaling in the Scotia Sea, a severe typhoon occurred with an average wind speed of 39 meters per second (above 32.6 meters per second is a Category 12 hurricane). Atmospheric pressure dropped to 712 mm. Waves reached heights of 20 meters. The typhoon was accompanied by a powerful blizzard. Visibility immediately decreased to 20 meters, and on the radar screen, huge waves could be seen submerging some icebergs. Such a strong typhoon was unprecedented in the whaling fleet's twelve Antarctic voyages since 1946. At this time, the fleet had to temporarily take refuge among the icebergs.

In this extremely complex situation, the whaling fleet members demonstrated great courage and nautical skill, finally overcoming the difficulties. Although some sailors suffered minor injuries, no one was killed. The typhoon subsided the next morning. The whaling fleet continued its work.

    战胜强烈台风袭击
    苏联“光荣”捕鲸船队无恙
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联“光荣”捕鲸队最近在南极战胜了十多年来它所遇到的最强烈的台风的袭击，船员无一死亡。
    1月17日，当苏联“光荣”捕鲸船队在斯科提亚海捕鲸的时候，海面上发生了强烈的台风，平均风速达每秒钟三十九公尺
  （每秒三十二点六公尺以上即为十二级飓风）。大气压减低到七百十二公厘。波浪高达二十公尺。台风中还夹杂着强大的暴风雪。视距立刻缩短到二十公尺，在雷达装置的萤光屏上，可以看到巨大的海浪把一些冰山都淹没了。这样强烈的台风是这个捕鲸队1946年以来十二次南极航行中从未遇到过的。这时，船队不得不暂时躲到冰山群中去。
    在这种极端复杂的情况下，捕鲸船队队员们表现了极大的勇敢和航海艺术，终于渡过了难关。虽然有个别的水手受了轻伤，但没有一人遇难。第二天早晨台风平息。捕鲸船队继续工作。
