    (Reported by this newspaper) The experience of Paoma Township, Dangyang County, Hubei Province, in mobilizing the masses to improve tools to solve the problem of labor shortage in water conservancy construction has been widely promoted in the Yichang Special District. Many agricultural cooperatives' water conservancy projects can therefore be completed ahead of schedule.

    After the Yichang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered Paoma Township's experience in improving tools, it organized a visiting group of more than 600 cadres, headed by Zhang Sanjie, the first secretary of the prefectural committee, including cadres from Dangyang, Yichang, and Yidu counties, to visit, summarize, and quickly launch a wave of tool improvement throughout the special district. In the past month, a total of 40,000 tools have been improved in more than 3,500 agricultural cooperatives in the eight counties of the district. Among them, 700 cooperatives have realized "vehicleization" (i.e., using vehicles to transport soil instead of manual labor) in water conservancy construction, and Dangyang County has basically realized "vehicleization." Generally, work efficiency has increased by two to three times, and in some cases, by dozens of times. As a result, more than 2,000 agricultural cooperatives and 40,000 water conservancy projects in the four counties of Dangyang, Yichang, Yidu, and Xingshan can be completed half a month to a month ahead of schedule. At the same time, a large amount of labor has been saved and put into manure accumulation, field management, sideline production, etc.

    Paoma Township is a hilly area. In summer, a drought appears after more than ten consecutive days of sunshine, and a rainstorm causes floods. In 1954, grain losses due to floods amounted to 750,000 jin, and in 1957, grain losses due to drought amounted to 700,000 jin. Since last winter, in order to eliminate water and drought disasters, the township decided to build water conservancy projects on a large scale. It is planned that after these water conservancy projects are completed, more than 92% of the paddy fields can be guaranteed a good harvest in 1958, and the township can achieve a plan of 800 jin of grain per mu.

    According to preliminary calculations, the completion of these water conservancy projects requires 113,800 workdays. Adding the six tasks of manure accumulation, field management, sideline production, and grain delivery, a total of 300,000 workdays are required. However, the township only has 3,227 full and semi-laborers. From mid-November 1957 to mid-February 1958, a total of 90 days, each laborer can only work about 200,000 workdays, based on 65 days of attendance, which is still 100,000 workdays short. What to do? In the township general branch committee, some people advocated compressing the water conservancy project plan, but in this way, the production increase plan could not be realized in the event of water and drought disasters like those of 1954 and 1957; some people advocated concentrating all forces to first engage in water conservancy and postponing other production, but the season waits for no one, and just engaging in water conservancy cannot realize the production increase plan. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that water conservancy projects and other production should be carried out simultaneously, and a blitzkrieg method must be adopted: all those who can work should attend work, extend working hours, and increase labor intensity. However, people felt overwhelmed by doing so. Although a high tide of water conservancy construction appeared, it quickly passed.

    In order to solve this problem, the general party branch organized all cadres to go down, tell the masses about the current difficulties, inspire the masses to recall the losses caused by past droughts, and organize everyone to debate the labor contradiction between solving water conservancy construction and engaging in other production. As a result, many people proposed that to solve the current labor contradiction, the tools for water conservancy construction should be improved to increase work efficiency. The general branch strongly supported this suggestion. Cadres took the lead in improving tools. One day late at night, guidance group leader Zhang Tiangao and commune members stayed up all night to make three handcarts; the second secretary of the general branch and the masses studied and made a tricycle, and personally pushed the cart to the construction site to transport soil the next day. Hu Qiquan, a member of the general branch (who used to be a carpenter), and his master Chen Yumei jointly made a "pestle-type ramming machine." These tools increased work efficiency by three or four times. The masses were very happy to see it and also actively improved tools. Commune members of Taishan, Xinglong, and Jiulong communes created stone rollers for ramming, handcarts, wooden sleds, etc., increasing work efficiency by six to seven times to dozens of times. The general branch then summarized the benefits of these improved tools: high work efficiency, low cost (raw materials came from the masses' waste wood, old furniture, etc.), simple technology, everyone can make them, everyone can use them, and immediately organized the masses to visit the site, so a wave of tool improvement was launched throughout the township. Five hundred and forty-four people proposed methods for improving tools, and three hundred and sixty-six people personally made tools. The whole township invested only 100 yuan and improved 14 kinds of tools, 562 pieces, eliminating heavy labor such as manual carrying of soil, and semi-laborers can also go to the construction site to work. The average work efficiency per person increased from 0.7 cubic meters to 2.9 cubic meters in the past. According to nine days of statistics, 9,296 workdays were saved. At present, although the earthwork project has been expanded from the original plan of 110,000 cubic meters to 160,000 cubic meters, it is estimated that 160,000 workdays can still be saved. The township's water conservancy project plan can be completed 20 days to a month ahead of schedule. Now, in addition to putting 50% of the labor force into water conservancy construction, the other laborers are put into manure accumulation, sideline production, field management, grain transportation, etc., and winter production has been fully launched.

    宜昌专区在兴修水利中推广跑马乡经验
    改进运土工具　工效提高几倍
    谁说任务太大劳力不足？只要发动群众就有办法！
    本报讯　湖北当阳县跑马乡在兴修水利中发动群众改进工具，解决劳力不足的经验，已经在宜昌专区普遍推广，许多农业社的水利工程因此可以提前完工。
    中共宜昌地委发现跑马乡改良工具的经验后，即组织了一个以地委第一书记张三杰为首的包括当阳、宜昌、宜都等县六百多名干部的参观团，到跑马乡参观、总结，跟着全专区很快掀起了改良工具的热潮。一个月来，全区八个县三千五百多个农业社共改良工具四万件，其中有七百个社兴修水利实现了“车子化”（即不用人工全用车子运土），当阳县基本上实现了“车子化”。一般提高工效两三倍，多的达数十倍。当阳、宜昌、宜都、兴山四县二千多个农业社四万处水利工程，因此可以提前半月到一月结束。同时节余了大批劳力投入积肥、田间管理、副业生产等。
    跑马乡是丘陵地区，夏天连出太阳十多天就出现旱象，下一阵雨就山洪暴发闹成水灾。1954年因水灾损失粮食七十五万斤，1957年因旱灾损失粮食七十万斤。从去冬开始，该乡为了消灭水旱灾害，决定大兴水利，计划这些水利工程完成后，1958年将有92％以上的水田可以保收，全乡可以实现亩产粮食八百斤的计划。
    根据初步计算，完成这些水利工程，需要十一万三千八百个工，加上积肥、田间管理、副业生产、送粮等六项任务，共需三十万个工。而全乡的全、半劳力只有三千二百二十七个，从1957年11月中旬做到1958年2月中旬共计九十天，每个劳力以出勤六十五天计算，仅可出工二十万个左右，尚差十万个工。怎么办呢？在乡总支委员会上有的人主张压缩水利工程计划，可是这样一来，遇到像1954年和1957年那样的水旱灾就不能实现增产计划；有的人主张集中一切力量先搞水利，把其他的生产推迟一步，可是季节不等人，光搞了水利，也不能实现增产计划。讨论结果，一致认为水利工程和其他的生产要同时进行，必须采取突击的办法：能劳动的人全部出勤，延长劳动时间，增加劳动强度。但是这样做，人们都感到吃不消。虽然出现兴修水利高潮，但很快就过去了。
    为了解决这个问题，党总支组织全体干部下去，把当前的困难问题告诉群众，启发群众回忆过去的干旱灾害带来的损失，组织大家对解决兴修水利和搞其他生产的劳力矛盾，展开辩论。结果许多人提出要解决当前的劳力矛盾问题，应该改良兴修水利的工具，提高工效。总支大力支持这个建议。干部首先带头改良工具。有一天深夜，指导组长张天高和社员一起熬通宵，制成三部手推车；总支第二书记和群众研究，仿做了一辆三轮车，第二天亲自推着车子到工地拖土。总支委员胡启全（过去是木匠）和他的老师傅陈于美合制出一架“椿臼式打硪机”。这些工具提高工作效率三、四倍。群众看见非常高兴，也积极改良工具。泰山、兴龙、九龙等社社员创造了石磙打硪、手推车、木拖子等，提高工作效率六、七倍到数十倍。总支随即总结这些改良工具的好处：工效高、花钱少（原料来自群众的废木料，破旧的家具等），技术简单，人人会做，人人会用，并立即组织群众到现场参观，于是全乡便掀起了改良工具的热潮，有五百四十四个人提出改进工具的办法，有三百六十六人亲自动手做工具。全乡仅投资一百元，便改良了工具十四种五百六十二件，消除人工抬土、挑土等笨重劳动，半劳动力也可以上工地干活，平均每人的工作效率由过去零点七方提高到二点九方。据九天统计，节余劳力九千二百九十六个。目前土方工程虽然由原计划十一万方扩大到十六万方，预计还可以节余劳力十六万个。全乡的水利工程计划可以提前二十天到一个月完成。现在全乡除以50％劳力投入兴修水利，其他的劳力都投入积肥、副业生产、田间管理、运粮等，冬季生产已全面开展起来。
