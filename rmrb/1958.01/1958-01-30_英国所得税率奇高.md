	Extremely High Income Tax Rates in Britain

	A citizen of Jersey Island in Britain angrily entered the local income tax office, slamming a loaf of bread and his coat on the table, attached to a tax notice from the tax bureau demanding income tax from him. He said to the tax official: "This is the bread taken from my mouth and the coat taken from my body. Now you have received the tax you wanted!"

	Note: Income tax collection is very heavy in Britain. In Jersey Island in the Channel Islands, the standard income tax rate is four shillings per pound, while on the British mainland it is about twice that amount.

    英国所得税率奇高
    英国泽西岛上一个市民怒气冲天地走进当地所得税局，将一条面包和他的外套砰然摔在桌上，上面附了一张税局向他征收所得税的通知单。他对税局的职员说：“这是从我嘴上拿下的面包和从我身上脱下的外套，现在你收到所要的税了！”
    按：英国所得税征收很重，在英吉利海峡群岛中的泽西岛，标准所得税率是每英镑征收四先令，而在英国本岛约为这数目的两倍。
