How to Make a Backward Township "Turn Over"
Xu Chuan, Xie Zhijun, Shu Juxian

Aiguo Township was a notoriously backward township in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province. The prominent manifestations were: 1. The remnant feudal forces were quite active. In the thirteen cooperatives in the township, six counter-revolutionaries who had slipped through the net were initially identified, and there were even more landlords, rich peasants, former Baos and Chiefs, and former military officers who engaged in sabotage. 2. The spontaneous capitalist forces were also more rampant than in ordinary townships. Five withdrawal groups, five speculative groups, four gambling groups, and one group each of embezzlement, theft, and hooliganism were found in the thirteen cooperatives. 3. The organization was seriously impure from the township to the cooperatives, from inside the Party to outside the Party. Among the seven township cadres (including five members of the Party General Branch Committee), four were bad elements; only one firmly supported the leadership of the Party and took the socialist road. Among the cooperative cadres, the heads of six cooperatives were old upper-middle peasants, and the heads of two cooperatives were leaders of commercial speculation groups. 4. Among the thirteen cooperatives, seven were backward cooperatives, and there were no first-class cooperatives at all.

Why was Aiguo Township so backward? There were three reasons: 1. Previous movements were not carried out thoroughly. There were "landlords who slipped through the net" in the "Land Reform," and "counter-revolutionaries who slipped through the net" in the "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries." Even after the former Party General Branch Secretary and Township Head, who had infiltrated the Party and usurped leadership positions, were arrested according to law, the backward situation still did not change. 2. Hostile class elements used people with serious capitalist tendencies among the wealthy middle peasants to usurp the leadership of the cooperatives. They directly controlled the leadership of four of the thirteen cooperatives, and eighteen cooperative cadres had close ties with landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. 3. Although the higher-level leading organs had carried out rectification in this township several times, they often dealt with matters on a case-by-case basis, without fully mobilizing the masses, and many problems were not thoroughly resolved. Therefore, this township had never been fundamentally transformed.

What are the main problems to be solved?

Generally speaking, the current socialist education movement focuses on resolving contradictions among the people, but this is not necessarily the case in backward townships. The situation in Aiguo Township shows that in this area, contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy coexist, and the latter is quite prominent. Moreover, some problems that occur in backward townships, such as demanding grain, demanding withdrawal from cooperatives, resisting the promotion of advanced agricultural technologies, and certain commercial speculation activities, often seem to be similar to the problems in ordinary townships on the surface, and seem to be mainly issues of ideological education. However, when exposed, hidden behind these phenomena are hostile class elements such as illegal landlords, rich peasants, former Bao chiefs, former company commanders, and key members of feudal secret societies, who play the roles of planners and behind-the-scenes commanders. This shows that in backward townships, the two types of contradictions are often intertwined. Therefore, it is necessary to simultaneously resolve the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and the contradictions among the people through the socialist education movement, and in the process of resolving them, it is necessary to clearly distinguish between the two different types of contradictions that are intertwined and resolve them with different methods. Clearly recognizing these special problems to be solved in backward townships and always paying attention to differentiating and simultaneously resolving these two contradictions in each stage of the movement is the main experience of Aiguo Township in carrying out the socialist education movement.

Who should be relied upon to solve the problems?

Because the problems in backward townships are complex, it is impossible to completely solve them without a strong work team. However, this should not create the illusion that all the cadres and masses in backward townships cannot be relied upon. The facts in Aiguo Township prove that in backward townships, it is still necessary to firmly believe in and rely on the majority of the masses and the cadres of the township and cooperatives in order to clarify all the problems, large and small, and obtain correct solutions.

However, in order to find the truly good cadres and fully mobilize the basic masses in backward townships, it is indeed necessary to carry out more detailed investigation and research work. The truly good cadres in backward townships are often the targets of attack, exclusion, and framing. On the surface, they often appear inactive, unwilling to speak much, unwilling to take charge of things, and even repeatedly ask to go home and quit their jobs. Some even scolded the higher-level leaders during the initial period of airing views. For example, Liu Jiangming, the deputy director of the Eleventh Cooperative in Aiguo Township, was passive in his work on weekdays, and at the beginning of airing views, he even scolded the staff in Party and state organs as landlords, as if they were "irreconcilable enemies." However, after the work team conducted an in-depth understanding, it turned out that he was a good cadre with a poor peasant background, who was the most active and reliable. He had personally seen that some bad people in the township had not yet received due punishment, and he was deeply attacked by the reactionary forces headed by the accountant (who was also a township people's representative) who was a former company commander in the cooperative. Therefore, he suspected that the Party and the government had changed their nature. After clarifying the situation, the work team sincerely explained to him that the previous situation was wrong, and one of the purposes of this movement was to solve these problems. Therefore, Liu Jiangming, who had always been "passive" and "resistant," became a brave general in this movement. There were many such good cadres in backward townships. Because the work team discovered them and firmly relied on them, things in Aiguo Township were much easier to handle than in previous movements.

The masses in backward townships are not necessarily backward. For example, Zhang Xinrang, a sixty-six-year-old poor peasant in the Seventh Cooperative, had persisted in fighting against reactionary forces and phenomena that harmed the collective interests of the cooperative and the interests of the state for eight years as if it was one day. The attacks and frames he suffered were too numerous to mention. However, his sincere heart was always closely linked with the Communist Party and the People's Government, and he was unyielding. Not long ago, he was once again removed from his post as deputy director of the cooperative due to slander by bad elements. However, when the work team arrived this time and clarified the truth, he was very moved and said, "This is really Chairman Mao sending people here!" At the debate, due to his influence, righteousness quickly prevailed over evil. The Aiguo Township work team, by connecting and closely uniting such a group of valuable activists, found the basic driving force for thoroughly transforming the backward township.

What are the special issues in carrying out airing views?

The experience of Aiguo Township proves that only by thoroughly airing views can all kinds of problems in backward townships be revealed and solved. It is groundless to fear that "airing views in backward townships will get out of control and cannot be brought back." However, in carrying out airing views in backward townships, it is necessary to solve two special problems: 1. What are the main concerns of the masses when airing views begins in backward townships? How to solve them? 2. What is the main sign that airing views in backward townships is thorough? How to achieve it?

When airing views began, the Aiguo Township work team found various concerns among the masses, the main ones being fear that the movement would not be thorough as in the past, and fear of retaliation after the work team left. The work team mainly took the following three measures to support the masses: 1. Before airing views, they first cracked down on those who had obvious sabotage activities, extinguished their evil winds, and promoted the righteousness of the peasants. 2. In each cooperative, reliable cadres and activists formed a leading group for airing views, setting aside the bad elements and grasping the leadership of the movement in the hands of the basic masses from the beginning of airing views. Cadres who did not participate in the leading group for airing views were assigned to manage current production and work under the control of the leading group. 3. The work team, on behalf of the Party and the government, sincerely stated that this rectification was different from previous movements, and that the rectification must be thorough. They also announced discipline, stating that no one should sabotage the airing of views. For bad cadres who were still secretly threatening the masses to air their views, the work team promptly criticized and stopped them, further dispelling the masses' concerns. As a result, airing views was led by the basic masses and quickly spread to the thirteen cooperatives. The experience of Aiguo Township proves that although the problems in backward townships are extremely complex, it is still possible to carry out extensive airing of views. As long as the basic masses see that the movement can be carried out thoroughly, they will be the first to come out and air their views, and their firepower will be even fiercer than in ordinary townships. When wealthy middle peasants also come out to air their views (often when the extensive airing of views is "very chaotic"), the figures who are usually hidden will also come out to "air their views."

The thoroughness of airing views in backward townships cannot be measured by the same standards as in ordinary townships. The airing of views in backward townships should not only thoroughly expose the shortcomings and errors in the leadership work of the township and cooperatives, and not only make the upper-middle peasants speak their minds, but also expose the problems belonging to the contradiction between ourselves and the enemy that have not been exposed and revealed in previous movements. Otherwise, the airing of views in backward townships will not be successful. From the situation in Aiguo Township, when the basic masses aired their views, they often first severely criticized the shortcomings in the work of the Party and the government, especially severely criticized why the many serious problems in their township and cooperatives had not been solved (these opinions often focused on criticizing the three bad styles in the leadership work). Then, they naturally turned to exposing the bad people and bad deeds in the township and cooperatives, and demanded that they be dealt with. However, the bad people hidden in the cadres would come out to obstruct them at this time. For example, the director of the Eleventh Cooperative engaged in speculative business with unscrupulous elements, fearing that the cooperative members would expose him. Therefore, he tried his best to incite the cooperative members to make trouble over the relationship between individuals and the state at the airing views meeting, attempting to cover up the problems within the speculative group. The comrades of the work team recognized this point and immediately spoke out in support of the airing of views by the masses. As a result, the problems of the speculative group headed by the director were exposed.

The debate in backward townships should achieve three goals simultaneously

Through extensive airing of views, all kinds of problems have been exposed. Who comes first, who comes later, and how to treat them differently? We believe that the first step is to clarify who was good and who was bad before and after liberation through recalling and comparing, first unify understanding and raise the consciousness of the masses on this point, and draw a clear line with those who have ulterior motives. Then debate the issues that are directly related to the majority of the masses, such as the amount of grain rations, so that the majority of the masses can further improve their understanding of the relationship between individuals, collectives, and the state, and draw a clear line. Then, criticize the prominent capitalist thoughts and actions of certain wealthy middle peasants. Through criticism, on the one hand, educate and win over the majority of wealthy middle peasants to stand up and accept the leadership of the Party and take the socialist road. At the same time, further expose and completely isolate the hostile class elements hidden behind them. At this time, turn the spearhead again to give the hostile class elements a concentrated blow, combined with court trials, and convene a township-wide meeting to deal with them. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses will be high.

Rectify the organization and consolidate the cooperatives

On the basis of the above victorious struggle, Aiguo Township turned to the gentle and meticulous internal rectification. At this time, another climax of airing views was set off. A series of airing views meetings were held from the township to the cooperatives. In just a few days, more than 1,300 opinions were put forward again, and the problems that must be improved in all aspects, such as the ideology and work style of cadres and the operation and management of the cooperatives, were basically all exposed.

In the process of rectification, the composition of the leading cadres was first adjusted, and the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants was firmly established, which provided a fundamental guarantee for solving all other problems. The Party and Youth League organizations have also undergone strict rectification. In addition, the ideological and work styles of cadres at all levels have also been improved and enhanced to varying degrees through mass criticism and self-criticism. In particular, by reducing subsidized work points and participating in labor, the work style of many cadres who were divorced from the masses in the past has been significantly improved. Now, on the basis of thoroughly rectifying the organization, we are deeply and meticulously rectifying the operation and management of the cooperatives.

    怎样使落后乡“翻身”
    许川　谢志均　舒菊先
    爱国乡是四川内江县全县出了名的落后乡。突出的表现是：1、封建残余势力相当活跃，在全乡十三个社中初步查出的漏纲反革命分子即有六个，有破坏活动的地主、富农、伪保甲长、伪军官的人数还更多。2、资本主义自发势力也比一般乡猖狂。十三个社中即查出退社集团五个，投机集团五个，赌博集团四个，贪污、盗窃、流氓集团各一个。3、从乡到社从党内到党外，组织严重不纯。七个乡干部中（包括党总支委员五人）就有四个是坏分子；坚决拥护党的领导走社会主义道路的，只有一人。社干部中有六个社的社长是老上中农，两个社长是商业投机集团的首领。4、十三个社中落后社就有七个，根本没有一类社。
    爱国乡为什么这样落后呢？原因有三：1、以往的历次运动都搞得不彻底。“土改”中有“漏纲地主”，“镇反”中有“漏纲反革命”，甚至在依法逮捕了混入党内窃取领导职位的前任党总支书记和乡长以后，落后状况仍然没有改变。2、敌对阶级分子利用富裕中农中资本主义思想严重的人，篡夺社的领导权。十三个社中有四个社的领导权直接被他们控制，社干部中有十八人同地主、富农、反革命分子有着密切的联系。3、上级领导机关虽然几次在这个乡进行整顿，但往往就事论事，没有充分发动群众，许多问题没有彻底解决。因此，这个乡就一直没有得到根本改造。
    要解决的主要问题是什么
    就一般情况说，这次开展社会主义教育运动是以解决人民内部矛盾为主，但在落后乡就不一定这样了。爱国乡的情况表明，在这里，人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾同时存在，后者并相当突出。而且落后乡所发生的一些问题，例如闹口粮、闹退社、抵制农业先进技术的推广和某些商业投机活动等等，从表面上看往往也和一般乡的问题差不多，好像也主要是思想教育问题。但是，揭穿来看，在这些现象的后面，却隐藏着不法地主、富农、伪保长、伪连长和封建会道门的骨干等等敌对阶级分子，他们并担当着策划人和幕后指挥者的角色。这就可以看出，在落后乡两种矛盾往往纠缠不清。因此，必须通过社会主义教育运动把敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾同时加以解决，而在解决的过程中还要善于把两种不同性质而又互相交织在一起的矛盾明确地区别开来，用不同的方法加以解决。明确认识落后乡所要解决的这些特殊问题，并在运动发展的每个阶段，始终注意区别对待而又坚持同时解决这两个矛盾，是爱国乡开展社会主义教育运动的主要经验。
    依靠什么人去解决问题
    由于落后乡问题复杂，要是没有坚强的工作组，问题是不可能彻底解决的。但是这绝不能造成一种错觉，似乎落后乡的干部和群众全都不能依靠了。爱国乡的事实证明，在落后乡同样必须坚定不移地相信和依靠群众多数及本乡本社的干部，才能把一切大大小小的问题弄清楚，并得到正确解决。
    但是，要在落后乡把真正的好干部找出来，把基本群众充分发动起来，确实需要加倍细致的调查研究工作。落后乡真正的好干部往往都是受打击、排斥和陷害的对象，他们在表面上经常表现不积极，不愿多说话，不愿多管事，甚至一再要求回家不干，有的在鸣放初期还责骂上级领导。例如爱国乡十一社副社长刘江明，平日工作消极，鸣放初期竟骂党和国家机关里的工作人员都是地主，大有“不共戴天”之势。但是，经过工作组的深入了解，原来他正是一位贫农成份、最积极可靠的好干部。他在乡里亲眼看到一些坏人至今没有得到应有的惩办，他在社里更深受以伪连长出身的会计（又是乡人民代表）为首的反动势力的百般打击，因而他就怀疑党和政府变质了。工作组在查明情况后，诚恳地向他说明以往那样是不对的，这次运动的目的之一正是要解决这些问题。因此，一贯“消极”、“抗拒”的刘江明成了这次运动中的一员虎将。诸如这样的好干部在落后乡大有人在，由于工作组发现了他们，坚决依靠了他们，因此，爱国乡的事情比以往历次运动都好办得多了。
    落后乡的群众并不一定是落后的。例如七社六十六岁的老贫农张新让，八年如一日，始终坚持同反动势力、同危害合作社集体利益和国家利益的现象作斗争。他受到的打击、陷害是一时说不完的。但是他那一颗赤诚的心始终同共产党、人民政府紧紧连在一起，不屈不挠。前不久他又一次因受坏分子诬蔑而被革除了副社长的职务，但是，这次工作组一去，查明了真象，他十分感动地说：“这真是毛主席派人来了！”辩论会上，由于他的影响，正气很快压倒歪风。爱国乡工作组通过串连发现和紧紧团结了这样一批可贵的积极分子，就找到了彻底改造落后乡的基本动力。
    开展鸣放有什么特殊问题
    爱国乡的经验证明，只有彻底地大鸣大放，才能把落后乡各式各样的问题统统揭示出来，从而求得解决。害怕在落后乡“放乱了，收不了场子”，是毫无根据的。但是，在落后乡搞鸣放，必须解决两个特殊问题：1、落后乡开始鸣放时群众的主要疑虑是什么？怎样解决？2、落后乡鸣放是否彻底的主要标志是什么？怎样达到？
    鸣放开始时，爱国乡工作组在群众中发现各种不同的疑虑，其中最主要的是怕运动像以往一样不彻底，怕工作组走了受报复。工作组主要采取了以下三项措施给群众撑腰。1、鸣放之前，先打击了那些有明显破坏活动的分子，灭他们的歪风，伸农民的正气。2、在每个合作社内，都由可靠的干部和积极分子组成鸣放领导小组，撇开坏分子，在鸣放一开始就把运动的领导权掌握在基本群众手中。不参加鸣放领导小组的干部分工管理当前生产，在领导小组的掌握之下进行工作。3、工作组代表党和政府诚恳地表示这次整风不同于以往历次运动，整风必须整彻底。并宣布纪律，任何人不得破坏鸣放。对于仍在暗中威胁群众鸣放的坏干部，工作组又及时予以批判制止，进一步解除了群众的顾虑。于是，鸣放由基本群众带头，迅速普及到十三个社。爱国乡的经验证明，落后乡的问题虽然极其复杂，但是同样可以开展大鸣大放。只要使基本群众看到运动一定能够搞彻底，他们就首先出来鸣放，而且火力比一般乡更猛；等到富裕中农也出来鸣放时（往往是在大鸣大放吵得“很乱”的时候），平时隐藏着的人物也就出来“鸣放”了。
    衡量落后乡的鸣放是否彻底，不能与一般乡用同一尺度。落后乡的鸣放，不仅要彻底揭发乡、社领导工作中的缺点、错误，也不仅要使上中农说出心里话，还要揭发出以往历次运动所没有暴露和揭发出来的属于敌我矛盾的问题。否则，落后乡的鸣放就不是成功的。从爱国乡的情况来看，基本群众鸣放时，往往首先是沉痛地严厉指责党和政府工作中的缺点，特别严厉指责为什么他们乡、社的许多严重问题一直没有得到解决（这些意见往往是集中批评领导工作中的三个坏主义）。接着就很自然地转到揭露乡、社中的坏人坏事，并且要求处理。但是，隐藏在干部中的坏人这时便会出来阻挠。例如，十一社社长和不良分子一起作投机生意，甚怕社员揭发，他就在鸣放会上极力煽动社员去闹个人和国家的关系问题，企图把投机集团内的问题掩盖起来。工作组的同志识破了这一点，立即发言支持群众的鸣放，于是，以社长为首的投机集团的问题便揭发出来了。
    落后乡的辩论要同时达到三个目的
    通过大鸣大放，各种各样的问题都揭露出来了。谁先谁后，怎样区别对待呢？我们认为，第一步是要通过回忆对比，弄清解放前后谁好谁坏，先在这一点上统一认识提高群众觉悟，和那些别有用心的分子划清界限。然后辩论和多数群众有直接关系的问题，如口粮多少的问题等，使多数群众在个人和集体和国家的关系问题上进一步提高认识，划清界限。再后，批判某些富裕中农突出的资本主义思想言行，通过批判，一面教育、争取富裕中农中的多数站过来接受党的领导、走社会主义道路，同时，也就进一步暴露并完全孤立了隐藏在他们背后的敌对阶级分子。这时再回转矛头给予敌对阶级分子以一次集中的打击，结合法庭审判，召开全乡大会进行处理。这样群众情绪便高涨起来了。
    整顿组织　巩固合作社
    在以上胜利斗争的基础上，爱国乡便转入了和风细雨的内部整风。这时又一次掀起了鸣放高潮。从乡到社举行了一系列的鸣放会，短短几天内即又提出一千三百多条意见，干部思想、作风及社的经营管理等各方面必须改进的问题基本上全都揭发出来了。
    整改过程中，首先调整了领导干部的成份，坚决树立贫农、下中农的领导优势，这就为解决其他一切问题提供了根本的保证。党、团组织也经过了严格的整顿。除此以外，各级干部的思想作风，也都通过群众性的批评和自我批评，有了不同程度的改进和提高。尤其是通过压缩补助工分参加劳动，使过去不少干部脱离群众的作风有了显著改进。现在，正在彻底整顿了组织的基础上，深入细致地整顿各社的经营管理。
