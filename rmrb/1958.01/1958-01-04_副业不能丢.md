Sidelines Must Not Be Abandoned
　　Gao Changren

    In the high tide of winter production, a few communes have abandoned sideline occupations. This situation deserves attention. Recently, Shanghong Township in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, one-sidedly emphasized water conservancy and abandoned other agricultural work, including sideline occupations. Xijiang Township also stipulated that they should concentrate on winter agricultural production and that members should not be allowed to engage in private sideline occupations. However, the members went up the mountains at night to chop firewood and transport charcoal, and in the early morning they picked it up and sold it to the market towns. As a result, although there were many people working during the day, many of them were listless.

    Liuyang County is a semi-hilly and semi-mountainous area, and there are also small coal mines in the county, so fuel was not a problem. However, recently many people have reported a shortage of fuel. One of the reasons is that the leaders of some townships and communes have too strict control over the labor force, and some members have no time to chop firewood and carry coal.

    In fact, when a large amount of labor is needed for intensive winter production, agricultural sidelines can be combined. If properly arranged, sideline occupations will not only not hinder agriculture, but also support it. The Xingjiang Agricultural Cooperative in this county has more than 40 people specializing in collective sideline production in the cooperative; many women are also engaged in auxiliary labor for sideline occupations, which serves as household sideline income. In the first two days of large-scale water conservancy, pest control, and fertilizer accumulation, the cooperative also stopped all sideline occupations and transferred the members engaged in sideline occupations to agriculture. Later, the management committee calmly studied it and felt that if sideline occupations were stopped, the cooperative would be short of money, which would bring adverse consequences. It would be difficult to cope with the members' need to pay for oil and salt alone. Therefore, they immediately restored all collective sideline occupations in the cooperative. As a result, the cooperative's monthly income in November and December was more than 1,000 yuan, more than in September and October. In this way, not only was the management committee not worried about the members' need to spend pocket money and other production expenses, but the members engaged in agricultural production also had food to eat and money to spend, and had no worries, which further stimulated their enthusiasm for labor. In addition, combined with rectification and improved work, the agricultural work was planned and arranged in stages, and the winter production of this cooperative was also carried out vigorously. The members are full of confidence in the yield of 1,000 catties of grain per mu.

    Now, some townships and communes in Liuyang County that abandoned sideline production in the high tide of winter production have also begun to pay attention to this issue. According to the characteristics of this area, where there are many sideline occupations and agriculture cannot be relaxed, the leaders of Xijiang Township absorbed the opinions of the masses and stipulated that after each commune engages in collective agricultural production for five days, it should take one day to allow the members to engage in collective and individual sideline occupations. After taking this measure, the members were very satisfied, and the efficiency of agricultural production was improved instead.

    副业不能丢
  　高长任
    在冬季生产的高潮中，有少数社却把副业丢开了。这个情况值得注意。湖南省浏阳县上洪乡最近片面强调水利，把其他农活连同副业一齐丢开。溪江乡也曾规定过集中搞冬季农业生产，不准社员私人搞副业。但社员们却在夜里上山砍柴、运木炭，清晨挑到集镇上去卖。这样一来，白天出工人数虽多，却有不少人无精打采。
    浏阳县是半丘陵、半山区，县境内还有小煤矿，燃料本来是不成问题的。但最近不少群众都反映缺烧的。原因之一就是有些乡、社的领导人把劳动力控制得过严，部分社员没有时间去打柴和挑煤。
    其实，在需要大批劳动力从事紧张的冬季生产的时候，农副业并不是不可以结合进行的。安排得好，副业不但不妨碍农业，还可以支援农业。这个县的星江农业社，有四十多人专门从事社里的集体副业生产；还有很多妇女从事副业的辅助劳动，作为家庭的副业收入。在大兴水利和除虫、积肥的头两天，社里也曾将全部副业停下来，把从事副业的社员都调去搞农业。后来，管委会冷静地研究了一下，觉得副业一停顿，社里就会缺钱，将要带来不良后果，光是社员要支付油盐钱就不好应付。于是，他们立即把全社集体副业恢复起来。结果，这个社11、12两个月中每月都收入一千多元，比9、10月份多。这样一来，不仅管委会对于社员要支零花钱和其他生产费用不发愁，从事农业生产的社员们，有饭吃有钱用，也无后顾之忧，更加发挥了劳动积极性。加上这里结合整风、改进工作，把农活有计划地分段安排，这个社的冬季生产也搞得轰轰烈烈。社员们对亩产千斤粮满怀信心。
    现在，浏阳县部分在冬季生产高潮中丢掉副业生产的乡和社，也开始注意了这个问题。溪江乡领导上根据这个地区副业多，农业也不能放松的特点，吸收群众意见，规定各社每搞五天集体农业生产后，就抽出一天时间，让社员搞集体的和个人的副业。采取这个措施后，社员十分满意，农业生产的效率反而提高了。
