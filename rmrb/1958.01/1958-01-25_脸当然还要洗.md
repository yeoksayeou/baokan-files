Everyone's Opinion

    Of Course, You Still Have to Wash Your Face
    Luo Honggao, Wangfeng Five-Five Agricultural Cooperative, Taiyuan

    A responsible comrade went up the mountain to visit cadres who had been sent to work in the countryside. One comrade raised the following question: "Water and charcoal are very convenient here, but some farmers don't have the habit of washing their faces every day. We, on the other hand, wash once every morning and again after coming back from the fields in the afternoon. If this continues, will it affect our relationship with the farmers?"

    This reminds me of something a friend in college told me: A classmate of mine has been using foul language lately, starting sentences with "Damn it" and ending them with "Screw your mother." When classmates criticized him, his reason was: "Farmers like to swear. Having a common language with them makes it easier to integrate after going to the countryside."

    We advocate that every comrade going up the mountains and down to the countryside must put aside the airs of intellectuals, make friends with farmers, and learn from them as teachers. We must never place ourselves outside the farmers or, even worse, above them. As long as we have a common goal of struggle and a shared destiny with the farmers, and humbly learn from them, we will naturally have a common language and common feelings. However, this common language is the noblest, most ideological, and combative language, certainly not things like "Damn it." Regarding washing one's face, I think we should take this attitude: when it is not possible to wash one's face, one should feel happy not washing it; but when it is possible to wash one's face, one should still wash it.

    Going up the mountains and down to the countryside, participating in productive labor and mass struggle, is to cultivate a new force of working-class intellectuals and establish a contingent of cadres who can withstand risks and fight for the cause of communism. When we are in the countryside, we should use our strengths and take on the responsibility of transforming the countryside in terms of agricultural technology, culture, and hygiene. The peasants say that cadres going to the mountains and countryside have brought culture and socialism to the countryside. This is truly a great initiative to change customs! After going to the countryside, if you don't influence and encourage "some" farmers to develop the good habit of washing their faces every day, but instead stop washing your own face; if the farmers weren't originally swearing all the time, but you become uncivilized and impolite... the farmers will be disappointed. What kind of revolutionary initiative is that!

    With the gradual implementation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), the face of the countryside will soon be焕然一新 (焕然一新 means take on a completely new look), and the lives of the peasants will be even more prosperous and civilized. Those who are determined to support the socialist construction of the countryside will contribute their knowledge and strength. -- I believe that such people will never be the kind who are afraid to even wash their faces in order to integrate with the farmers!

### 脸当然还要洗

    脸当然还要洗
    太原王封五五农业社　罗洪皋
    某负责同志上山探望下放干部，有位同志提出了这样一个问题：“我们这里水、炭都极方便，有些农民却没有天天洗脸的习惯，而我们呢，每天早上洗一次，下午从地里回来还要洗一次。这样下去，会不会影响我们同农民的关系？”
    这使我想起大学里一个朋友讲过这样一件事情：有个同学，近来嘴里又不大干净了，开口“他妈的”，闭口“×你妈”。同学批评他，他的理由是：“农民喜欢说粗话，和他们有了共同的语言，下乡以后就容易打成一片了。”
    我们提倡每一个上山下乡的同志，都必须放下知识分子的架子，和农民交朋友，拜农民为老师，绝不能置身于农民之外，更不能站在农民之上。只要我们和农民群众有共同的奋斗目标，共同的命运，并虚心地向他们学习，自会和农民群众有了共同的语言和共同的感情。可是，这共同的语言是最高尚、最富有思想性、战斗性的语言，绝不是“他妈的”之类。对于洗脸，我认为应该持这样态度：在不能洗脸的情况下，不洗脸也感到愉快；而在能够洗脸的情况，脸还是应该洗的。
    上山下乡，参加生产劳动和群众斗争，是为了培养工人阶级知识分子的新队伍，建立一支为共产主义事业奋斗的经得起风险的干部队伍。当我们在农村里的时候，我们应该利用自己的长处，担负起在农业技术、文化卫生等方面改造农村的责任来。农民说，干部上山下乡，给农村带来了文化，带来了社会主义。这真是移风易俗的伟大创举！下乡之后，如果你不是影响和带动“有些”农民也养成天天洗脸的好习惯，而是自己也不洗脸了；本来农民也不是粗话不离口，而你却不文明无礼貌了……农民会失望的。那还算什么革命的创举！
    随着全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的逐步实现，农村面貌很快又会焕然一新，农民的生活将更加富裕和更加文明。有志于支援农村社会主义建设的人们会把自己的知识和力量贡献出来的。——我相信，这样的人绝不会是为了和农民打成一片就连脸也不敢洗了的人！
