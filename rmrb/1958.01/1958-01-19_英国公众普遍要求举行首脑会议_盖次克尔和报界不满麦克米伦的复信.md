Xinhua News Agency, January 18th, London dispatch: British Labour Party leader Gaitskell, in commenting on British Prime Minister Macmillan's reply to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin on the 17th, said that Britain should have done three things, but did not. These three things are: 1. Accept the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone as the basis for East-West talks; 2. Suggest the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in Germany, Poland, and other countries, and "supervise" the armaments possessed by these countries; 3. Agree to hold East-West summit talks. Gaitskell also said that the timeframe suggested by Bulganin for preparing for the summit talks was "sufficient."

Some British newspapers also criticized Macmillan's reply on the 17th.

The Labour Party's "Daily Herald" published an editorial entitled "Why Not Show it with Action?" pointing out: Macmillan's reply "avoids giving a 'yes' or 'no' answer to Russia's suggestion of holding a summit meeting in two or three months. ... But, as Macmillan himself said, 'Words alone cannot achieve peace; we need to take action.'" The newspaper believes that Britain should begin such action by announcing a halt to hydrogen bomb testing.

The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" published an editorial entitled "Insufficient Reply," pointing out that Macmillan's reply to Bulganin's invitation to hold East-West summit talks did not give a direct answer, and therefore "did not move forward." The newspaper emphasized that now "the important thing is to make a start and find a common ground on which practical agreements can be reached," and that it is necessary to "open up a new situation" instead of being stuck in a stalemate for a long time.

On the same day, the British Peace Committee announced that a group of prominent British figures had written to the British government demanding a summit conference of heads of government and action to ease international tensions. Among those who signed the letter were Royal Society (British Academy of Sciences) members Russell and Bernal, writers MacKenzie, Warner, and Goldring, and trade union activists Hollingworth, Gardinar, Johns, Wood, and Painter. The British Peace Committee decided to hand over the letter to the leaders of the parliamentary groups of various political parties.

    英国公众普遍要求举行首脑会议
    盖次克尔和报界不满麦克米伦的复信
    据新华社18日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党领袖盖次克尔17日在评论英国首相麦克米伦给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的回信的时候说，英国本来应当作三件事，但是却没有作。这三件事情是：一、接受关于建立一个无原子武器地区的建议，把这个建议作为东西方会谈的基础；二、建议撤退驻在德国、波兰等国的一切外国军队和对这些国家所拥有的军备实行“监督”；三、同意举行东西方最高级会谈。盖次克尔还说，为了替最高级会谈进行准备，布尔加宁所建议的期限“足够了”。
    一些英国报纸在17日也批评麦克米伦的复信。
    工党的“每日先驱报”以“为什么不以行动表现？”为题发表社论指出：麦克米伦的回信“对俄国要求在两三个月内举行一次最高级会议的建议避免作出‘是’或‘否’的答复。……但是，正如麦克米伦本人所说，‘光是言词是不能得到和平的，我们需要采取行动’”。这家报纸认为，英国应该以宣布停止试验氢弹来开始这样的行动。
    自由党的“新闻纪事报”以“不充分的答复”为题发表社论指出，麦克米伦在给布尔加宁的回信中对于举行东西方最高级会谈的邀请没有给予直接的答复，因而“没有前进一步”。报纸强调，现在“重要的事情是起个头，找出一个可能达成实际协议的共同点”，必须“打开新的局面”，而不要长期陷于僵局。
    同一天，英国和平委员会宣布，一批著名的英国人士写信给英国政府要求举行各国政府首脑会谈和采取行动缓和国际紧张局势。在信上签名的有皇家协会（英国科学院）的会员罗素、贝尔纳，作家马肯齐、华尔纳、戈尔德林，工会活动家霍林斯沃斯、加丁纳、约翰斯、伍德、佩恩特等人。英国和平委员会决定把这封信交给各政党议会党团的领袖。
