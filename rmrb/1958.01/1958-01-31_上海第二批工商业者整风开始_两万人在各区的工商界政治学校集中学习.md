Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 30th. Following the completion of rectification and study by 6,000 key industrial and commercial figures in Shanghai, the second batch of 20,000 industrial and commercial businessmen has begun rectification. They are generally the main private personnel of joint state-private factories and stores. Starting from the 30th, these industrial and commercial figures will go to the industrial and commercial political schools in eighteen districts for concentrated study.

According to the plans of the Industrial and Commercial Rectification Work Committees of each district, the rectification time for this batch of industrial and commercial businessmen will be approximately two and a half months. During the rectification process, each person must examine their political stance and erroneous words and deeds, adopt methods of mutual help and mutual criticism, and combine this with the debate on the seven questions raised by Li Weihan, head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, in his speech last August on comprehensively carrying out the rectification movement in industrial and commercial circles. It is required that through rectification, the words and deeds of right-wing elements are thoroughly exposed and criticized, and the industrialists and businessmen receive a socialist education with the content of destroying the capitalist stance and establishing the socialist stance.

Among the first batch of key industrial and commercial figures who participated in the rectification study, more than 1,300 people have been assigned to work in various district schools to help the 20,000 industrial and commercial businessmen in their rectification.

    上海第二批工商业者整风开始
    两万人在各区的工商界政治学校集中学习
    新华社上海30日电　上海市继六千名工商界骨干分子整风学习结束后，第二批两万名工商业者的整风接着开始。他们一般都是公私合营工厂、商店的主要私方人员。从30日起，这批工商业者分别到十八个区的工商界政治学校进行集中学习。
    根据各区工商界整风工作委员会的规划，这批工商业者的整风时间约两个半月。整风过程中，每个人要检查自己的政治立场和错误言行，采取相互帮助、相互提意见的方式开展批评和自我批评，并且结合中共中央统战部部长李维汉去年8月就工商界全面开展整风运动问题发表的谈话中提出的七个问题进行辩论。要求通过整风，彻底揭露和批判右派分子的言行，对工商业者们进行一次以破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场为内容的社会主义教育。
    在第一批整风学习的工商界骨干分子中，有一千三百多人被分配到各区校担任工作，帮助这二万名工商业者整风。
