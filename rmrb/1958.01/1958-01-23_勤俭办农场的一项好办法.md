A Good Way to Run Farms Diligently and Frugally
    Ding Luxu

    In the past, the dormitories for staff and family members of state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province were all built with state investment. Although the investment amount has reached about 10% of the total capital construction investment, many employees still do not have housing. Most of the farm's family dormitories are made of mud and grass. Employees only live in the houses but do not pay attention to maintenance or repairs. As a result, they deteriorate quickly. The farm has to spend a lot of money every year on repairs such as plastering mud, building kang platforms, building fire walls, and repairing roofs. Although employees pay rent, which is a certain burden on their living expenses, the farm's income from this rent is not even enough to cover the repair expenses. In 1957, the operating expenses for employee dormitories at the Chahayang Farm exceeded income by more than 28,000 yuan. Judging from the above situation, it is not beneficial to the state or the employees to have the state invest in the construction of employee family dormitories for farms.

    Last year, more than 100 employee households at the Jiusan Farm built family dormitories using the methods of self-construction with public assistance and mutual assistance, which not only saved state investment but also reduced the burden on employees' living expenses. This is indeed a good way to run farms diligently and frugally.

    In early spring last year, two employees at the Jiusan Farm requested to build their own dormitories and asked for loans to help. At that time, one was lent 40 yuan and the other was lent 36 yuan, mainly for buying iron parts, buying glass, and making doors and windows. The grass used for roofing and the grass used for the mud and grass walls were all cut by the employees' family members and the employees themselves in their spare time, and the frame timber was mostly cut from the eliminated trees in the mountains and forests under the farm's management, which did not cost any money. The houses were built during farming breaks and holidays, with everyone's help and family members working together, without paying any labor costs. In this way, the houses were built with very little money. The farm leaders organized the staff to visit, and everyone agreed that it was very good. Then many employees applied to build their own houses. The farm leaders gave strong support. On the one hand, they planned the location for the employees to build houses, so that the employees could build dormitories in a planned and orderly manner; on the other hand, they lent the necessary expenses separately, and sold the remaining useless boards from previous construction to employees cheaply for making frames, and also made some doors and windows to sell to employees. Without affecting production, the farm's carts sometimes transported some building materials for the employees (such as taking a trip when leaving in the morning and returning in the evening). The production team leader sometimes called on everyone to help the employees who were building dormitories during their spare time, which solved a big problem. There was also mutual assistance among the employees. You help me, I help you. In this way, more than 100 family dormitories were built in one year, and only 30 to 40 households borrowed money from the farm, totaling no more than 1,000 or 2,000 yuan. One household built three rooms, with a kitchen, bedroom, and reception room. The walls were painted snow-white, with large glass windows. It was very beautiful and comfortable to live in, but it cost very little money.

    From the farm's specific situation, taking the method of self-construction with public assistance and mutual assistance to build employee family dormitories has the following advantages: First, building materials such as grass, wood, sand, and stone in the farm can be obtained locally, and employees can obtain them without spending money; second, agricultural production is seasonal, and employees have ample time to build houses during farming gaps; third, rural house structures are simple and do not require strict technical design, making them easy to build. Based on these characteristics and the experience gained by some farms, the state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province have determined that from 1958, employee family dormitories will be built using the method of self-construction with public assistance and mutual assistance, and the state will no longer invest.

    勤俭办农场的一项好办法
    丁履枢
    黑龙江省国营农场的职工家属宿舍，过去全部是国家投资建造的，投资数额虽已达基建投资总额的10％左右，但是还有许多职工没有房子住。农场的家属宿舍大部分是泥草结构，职工们只是住房，不注意爱护，更不进行整修，因而损坏得很快，每年都要农场开支大量费用进行抹泥、打炕、砌火墙、苫房盖等修补工作。职工们虽然交纳了房租，在生活费用上有一定负担，但农场收入的这笔房租，连修缮支出也不够。查哈阳农场1957年职工宿舍经营支出就超过收入二万八千多元。从上述情况看，农场的职工家属宿舍由国家投资修建，对国家对职工都没有好处。
    九三农场去年有一百多户职工，采取自建公助和互助的方法，修建了家属宿舍，既节省了国家投资，又减轻了职工生活负担。这确是勤俭办农场的一项好办法。
    去年春初，九三农场有二名职工向领导上要求自建宿舍，请求借款帮助。当时一名借给四十元，另一名借给三十六元，主要用于买铁活、买玻璃和制作门窗。苫房草和泥草墙所用的草都是职工家属和职工自己在业余时间割的，房架木料大部分是在划归农场管理的山林里剪伐的淘汰树，这些都不用花钱。房子是用农作间隙和放假时间，通过大家帮助和家属一齐动手盖起来的，不花工钱。这样用钱很少就把房子盖起来了。农场领导上组织场内人员参观了一下，一致认为很好，接着就有很多职工申请自己盖房。农场领导上给予了大力支持。一方面规划出职工盖房的地点，让职工们有计划地、整齐地建造宿舍；另一方面分别借给必要的费用，并把过去修建剩余的无用的板皮廉价卖给职工作房架，又制作了一些门窗卖给职工。在不影响生产的情况下，农场的大车有时也给职工运一些建筑材料（如早晨出车和晚间收车时就便拉一趟）。生产队长根据具体情况，有时在业余时间号召大家帮助修建宿舍的职工干一阵，解决很大问题。职工之间也展开了互助，你帮我，我帮你。就这样，一年中一百多户家属宿舍建起来了，而向农场借款的只有三、四十户，总共不过一、二千元。有一户盖了三间房，有厨房、卧室，还有会客室，墙刷的雪白，大玻璃窗子，很漂亮，住起来很舒适，可是花钱却很少。
    从农场的具体情况来看，采取自建公助和互助的方法，建造职工家属宿舍，有以下一些优越条件：第一，农场里草、木、砂、石等建筑材料，都可以就地取材，职工们不花钱就能取到；第二，农业生产具有季节性，在农作间隙里，职工们有充裕的时间可以建造房子；第三，农村房屋构造简单，不需什么严格的技术设计，建造容易。根据这些特点和有些农场已取得的经验，黑龙江省的国营农场已确定从1958年起，职工家属宿舍一律采取自建公助和互助的方法建造，国家不再投资。
