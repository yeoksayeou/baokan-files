Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Soviet government peace proposals have aroused increasingly strong reactions internationally. Public opinion in the United States, Western Europe, and Arab countries has expressed support for holding East-West talks, while criticizing the United States' stubborn attitude of obstructing negotiations.

    Cyrus Eaton, a prominent American entrepreneur, stated in the "Chicago Daily News" that the most important issue at present is "seeking a way to live in peace with Russia." He said that for the past twelve years, we have been waging a cold war against Russia in military, political, cultural, diplomatic, and ideological terms. Twelve years ago, we were unwilling to negotiate with the Russians because we believed we were far superior to them in terms of weaponry. Now we are unwilling to negotiate, claiming that the Russians have surpassed us, and we cannot negotiate from a position of weakness. He pointed out: "The Russians have made many peace proposals to us, but we have ignored these proposals… In the United States, people also advocate peace, but they dare not speak their minds for fear of being accused of falling for Russian propaganda."

    The "Chicago Daily News," commenting on Eaton's views, wrote: "Eaton believes that the blame for the current situation lies with the United States. We are the aggressors in the Cold War. He hopes that our country can take the first step on the road to peace. He advocates abandoning the policy of deterrence, abandoning our bases in NATO countries, and also advocating that we achieve peace through various other means."

    The "Washington Post and Times Herald," in its editorial on the 11th, advocated holding East-West summit talks and criticized Secretary of State Dulles' negative attitude on this issue. The newspaper advocated convening a limited summit to discuss a treaty of non-aggression.

    The "New York Post," in an editorial on January 6, criticized the American argument that the United States must catch up with the Soviet Union in missiles before East-West negotiations can be held, calling this a "position of strength" rhetoric, believing that it will only lead to a new stalemate. The editorial argued that Dullesism has failed because it "over-relies on a balance of military power that is seen as real but is actually illusory" and "completely lacks the ability to recognize that the nature of weapons has changed all the old standards of international diplomacy."

    The Soviet proposals have become the focus of attention in West German political circles and Western European public opinion.

    West German Chancellor Adenauer held a meeting on the 11th with Foreign Minister Brentano, Information Bureau Director Eckardt, and Chairman of the Federal Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee Kissinger to study the Soviet proposals. West German Federal Parliament Speaker Gerstenmaier, in a speech in Bremen, advocated carefully studying Bulganin's letter. He called on West Germany to "adopt a positive policy in its attitude towards the East."

    The British Conservative Party's "Daily Mail" emphasized that now is the time to hold East-West negotiations, starting with the proposal put forward by Khrushchev and accepted by Macmillan (referring to the signing of a treaty of non-aggression). The newspaper also criticized Eisenhower's reply to the Soviet government, arguing that the letter gives the impression that the East is far more eager to resolve the problem than the West.

    The "Evening Standard" conducted an opinion poll on the issue of holding East-West negotiations. The results of the poll showed that the majority of those surveyed supported the Soviet proposal to hold a summit meeting to ease international tensions.

    The Danish "Information" pointed out that Bulganin's letters to the heads of government of many countries put forward suggestions for improving East-West relations and easing international tensions, but Eisenhower's message made no mention of similar measures. Western leaders have had to admit that, in the eyes of neutral countries and most people in Western countries, the Soviet Union is more peace-loving than the United States and its allies.

    Many newspapers in the Austrian capital, Vienna, pointed out that many prominent government leaders and politicians in the West have expressed agreement with the Soviet proposal to convene a high-level international conference.

    The Belgian Catholic newspaper "La Capitale" emphasized: "If a conference is held between members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and members of the Warsaw Pact, this means that some small countries, such as Belgium, will be able to participate in the negotiations along with all countries. In the past, although they were very concerned about such negotiations, they were usually excluded from them."

    Newspapers in Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon warmly welcomed the Soviet peace proposals, while condemning Dulles for rejecting the Soviet proposals for easing international tensions.

    The Cairo newspapers particularly emphasized the point in the Soviet proposal that invited some non-aligned countries, such as Egypt, to participate in the proposed summit of heads of state.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Lord Boyd Orr, the Scottish winner of the 1947 Nobel Peace Prize, said in a televised speech for the annual banquet of Nobel laureates held in New York on the 12th, "The only way to ease world tensions is to hold East-West talks. The US attitude that Russia must first show their sincerity with action before the US can agree to hold summit talks is completely wrong." He also called on all countries to recognize China. He said that non-recognition of China and obstruction of the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations are obstacles to peace.

    Former Canadian Foreign Minister and 1957 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Pearson called on the West at the banquet to try to hold new negotiations with the Soviet Union through diplomatic channels, rather than first asking Soviet leaders to prove their "sincerity."

    In a written statement to the banquet held in New York on the 11th for past Nobel Peace Prize laureates, the famous British philosopher Russell suggested that the United States should immediately hold secret talks with the Soviet Union in order to find a compromise solution to eliminate the world crisis and establish a neutral zone in Europe.

    K. V. Raman of India, winner of the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics, and other Nobel laureates also appealed to politicians and scientists in a telegram to the conference to seek peace and eliminate the danger of nuclear war.

### 四面八方响应苏联和平建议  美国阻挠协商遭到国内外舆论强烈斥责  诺贝尔奖金获得者要求西方同苏联谈判

    四面八方响应苏联和平建议
    美国阻挠协商遭到国内外舆论强烈斥责
    诺贝尔奖金获得者要求西方同苏联谈判
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联政府的和平建议在国际上引起了越来越强烈的反应。美国、西欧国家和阿拉伯国家的舆论纷纷表示赞成举行东西方会谈，同时抨击美国阻挠协商的顽固态度。
    美国著名的企业家赛勒斯·伊顿在“芝加哥每日新闻”上发表谈话说，目前最重要的问题是“寻求同俄国和平相处的方法。”他说，最近十二年来我们在军事、政治方面，在文化、外交和思想方面一直在对俄国进行着冷战。十二年前，我们不愿意同俄国人进行谈判，因为我们当时认为我们在武器方面比他们优越得多。现在我们又不愿意谈判，说是由于俄国人赶过了我们，我们不能从弱者的地位进行谈判。他指出：“俄国人向我们提出了许多和平建议，而我们却对这些建议置之不理……在美国，人民也主张和平，但是人们不敢说出他们的意见，因为有人会指责他们上了俄国宣传的当”。
    “芝加哥每日新闻”在评述伊顿的看法时写道：“伊顿认为，造成目前局势的罪过是在美国身上。我们是冷战中的侵略者。他希望我国能够在建立和平的道路上迈出第一步。他主张放弃威慑政策，放弃我们在北大西洋公约组织国家的基地，还主张我们通过其他各种途径来实现和平”。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”在11日的社论中主张举行东西方最高级会谈，并且抨击国务卿杜勒斯在这个问题上采取的消极态度。这家报纸主张召开一次有限的最高级会议，来讨论一项互不侵犯条约。
    “纽约邮报”1月6日在社论中批评美国提出的美国必须在导弹方面赶上苏联以后才能举行东西方谈判这种“从实力地位出发”的言论，社论认为这只会导致新的僵局。社论认为，杜勒斯主义之所以破产，就是因为它“过分依赖被视为确实而实际上是幻想的军事力量的平衡”，“完全没有能力承认武器的性质已经改变了国际外交的一切旧尺度”。
    苏联的建议已经成为西德政界和西欧舆论注意的中心。
    西德总理阿登纳在11日同外交部长勃伦塔诺、新闻局长埃卡特、联邦议院外交委员会主席基辛格等人举行会议，研究苏联的建议。西德联邦议院议长格斯登美尔在不来梅发表谈话，主张仔细研究布尔加宁的信。他要求西德“在对东方的态度方面采取积极的政策”。
    英国保守党的“每日邮报”强调说，现在是举行东西方谈判的时候了，可以从赫鲁晓夫提出的而为麦克米伦所接受的建议（指签订互不侵犯条约）开始。这家报纸还批评艾森豪威尔给苏联政府的复信，认为，这封信使人觉得，东方远比西方希望解决问题。
    “新闻晚报”就举行东西方谈判问题举行了一次民意测验，测验结果表明，参加测验的大部分人都赞成苏联提出的举行最高级会议以缓和国际紧张局势的建议。
    丹麦“新闻报”指出，布尔加宁给许多国家政府首脑的信件提出了改善东西方关系和缓和国际紧张局势的建议，但是艾森豪威尔的咨文却一点也没有提到类似的措施。西方国家领导人不得不承认，在中立国和西方国家大多数人民的印象中，苏联是比美国和美国的盟国更热爱和平的。
    奥地利首都维也纳的许多报纸指出，西方许多著名的政府领导人和政治家都表示同意苏联关于召开最高级国际会议的建议。
    比利时天主教报纸“首都报”着重指出：“如果北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约成员国之间举行会议，这就意味着一些小国，例如像比利时这样的国家，将能够同所有国家一道参加谈判。而在过去，它们虽然对这种谈判很关心，通常却是被排斥在这些谈判之外的。”
    埃及、叙利亚和黎巴嫩的报纸热烈欢迎苏联的和平建议，同时谴责杜勒斯拒绝苏联关于缓和国际紧张局势的建议。
    开罗各报特别重视苏联建议中的这一点，就是，邀请一些如埃及等没有参加集团的国家参加建议中的各国首脑会议。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：1947年度诺贝尔和平奖金苏格兰得奖人波伊德—奥尔勋爵12日为在纽约举行的诺贝尔奖金获得者一年一度的宴会发表电视谈话说，“缓和世界紧张局势的唯一道路是举行东西方会谈，美国要俄国人必须先用行动来表示他们的诚意，然后美国才能同意举行最高级会谈的态度是完全错误的”。他还要求各国承认中国。他说，不承认中国和阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法席位的做法是对和平的一个障碍。
    前加拿大外交部长、1957年诺贝尔和平奖金获得者皮尔逊在宴会上要求西方设法通过外交途径和苏联举行新的谈判，而不要先要求苏联领袖证明他们的“诚意”。
    英国著名哲学家罗素在给11日在纽约为历届诺贝尔和平奖金获得者们举行的宴会的书面发言中建议，美国应当立即同苏联举行秘密会谈，以便觅致一个折衷方案来消除世界危机和建立一个欧洲中立地带。
    1930年诺贝尔物理学奖金获得者、印度的克·维·拉曼和其他一些得过诺贝尔奖金的人在给会议的电报中，也向各国政治家和科学家们呼吁谋求和平和消除核战争的危险。
