Title: Is It Okay to Be “Red” Later?

　　Recently, many college students have been passionately discussing the issue of "Red vs. Expert." In the discussion, many students advocated that "we should concentrate on academics in school and then focus on making up for political shortcomings after graduation," and be "Red" later. They believe that there is no danger in doing so, "since we already live in a socialist society, we will definitely serve socialism in the future."

　　Is this idea feasible? This is a question that many students are concerned about.

　　Let's discuss whether we can concentrate on academics and put politics aside temporarily, becoming "Red" later? As we all know, the main content of "politics" and "Red" here is ideological remolding, which is "promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie," and ultimately being transformed into intellectuals of the working class. So, can this kind of remolding be suspended for a period of time? Countless historical facts tell us that this is impossible, because people's subjective world often lags behind the objective world. Even if we grasp ideological remolding tightly, we will often fall behind. If we relax even a little, we will fall behind and become laggards of the times. Some people passed the test of the democratic revolution, and were even leftists at that time, but they were unwilling to move forward with the times and did not pass the test of socialism. Some even became rightists, which is a good illustration. What's more, most of the current college students come from non-working-class families, and the influence of bourgeois ideas and habits is still quite strong. If these college students do not seize every opportunity to squeeze out and eliminate these dirty things from their minds, then when they get together, they will naturally talk about trivial matters (socialism). They will not care about industrial and agricultural production and the lives of workers and peasants, but will only be interested in personal fame and fortune, their vision will become shorter and shorter, and their circle of life will become narrower and narrower. They will live with capitalism for a long time without "smelling its stench," and the distance between them and working-class intellectuals will become even greater, making them incompatible with socialism. In this way, you will not even have time to focus on making up for political shortcomings and becoming "Red," and you will have already become "White." Even some "Red" colors that you had in the past will be washed away completely. This is just like living things in nature. If they can carry out normal metabolism, they can grow healthily and strongly. If they cannot see the sun and cannot get air, water, and nutrients, they will inevitably wither and rot. There is no absolute stillness, only progress or regress. For example, some college students originally advocated "expert first, then Red" and did not care about politics. However, the set of bourgeois political views that they originally had in their minds was not cleared away, but was developing secretly. When the rightists attacked the Party, some were very interested in bourgeois democracy and freedom, and resonated with it, losing their direction. Others were very concerned about bourgeois politics, degenerating into rightist elements, and quickly united with other rightist elements to frantically attack the Party. Aren't these lessons from students who advocated "expert first, then Red"?

　　Perhaps some students will say this: "Not everyone who is unwilling to remold their thinking will become a rightist. As long as they are not rightists, can't they still serve socialism?" Indeed, rightist elements are only a minority, and they will naturally not serve socialism loyally, so there is no need to say more here. However, is it true that everyone living in a socialist society, except for rightist elements, is destined to serve socialism loyally? Facts prove that this is not the case.

　　It is undeniable that most college students have more or less bourgeois individualism. If they are still reluctant to cut off this ugly and cumbersome tail when they are studying in school, and are half-hearted or indecisive towards the Party and socialism, then how can we believe that they will serve the people wholeheartedly after they go to work? Obviously, this is impossible. For example, some students in medical schools are only interested in difficult and complicated cases during their internship, believing that it is "input," and are not interested in general cases, believing that it is "output," and try to avoid them if they can. When these students graduate and have "capital" (knowledge, technology, etc.), they will bargain with the people, and the higher their "capital" is, the higher the price they will demand. I once heard about such a thing: a medical school graduate, after becoming a doctor, did not feel grateful for the cultivation of the Party and the state, but regarded what he learned in school as private property. Relying on his "capital," he bargained with the people, and shamelessly said: "In the past, a doctor could earn more than 1,000 yuan a month, and everyone had to listen to what I said, but now I only earn more than 100 yuan a month." Obviously, for this student living in a socialist society, there is no question of serving socialism loyally, and he is even farther away from the revolutionary spirit of "willing to be an ox for the people," and has become a "semi-finished product" from a socialist university, wasting the blood and sweat of the working people. Of course, the working people will not be willing to cultivate such bourgeois goods again.

　　Ideological remolding is very arduous. We must constantly fight against bourgeois ideology, and we must go through long-term practical training and testing to "promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie" and become a true Red expert - an intellectual of the working class. It is impossible to find a "shortcut" and quickly dye ourselves Red. We believe that the vast majority of students will follow the correct direction pointed out by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, embark on the bright road of "both Red and expert," and appear before the people as the first batch of Red experts in New China, instead of repeating the tortuous and painful path that intellectuals in the old society had to take.

### 晚一些“红”可以吗？

    晚一些“红”可以吗？
  　文生
    最近，许多大学生热烈地讨论着“红与专”的问题。在讨论中，不少学生主张“在学校里应集中力量搞业务，毕业后再突击一下补政治”，晚一些“红”。他们认为这样作没有什么危险，“反正已经生活在社会主义社会里，将来一定为社会主义服务”。
    这个主张行得通吗？这是许多学生关心的一个问题。
    让我们来讨论一下，能够集中精力搞业务，把政治暂时搁置一旁，晚一些再“红”吗？大家了解，这里所说的“政治”和“红”的主要内容是思想改造，是“兴无灭资”，最后改造成为工人阶级的知识分子。那么，能不能把这种改造停滞一个时期呢？无数的历史事实告诉我们这是办不到的，因为人们的主观世界往往落后于客观世界，抓紧思想改造，还会时常落在后边，如果稍一松懈，就会掉队，成为时代的落伍者。过去有些人过了民主革命的关，甚至那时还是一个左派，但是他们不肯跟着时代前进，却没有过了社会主义这一关，有的还成了右派，就是很好的说明。何况，目前大学生中多数出身于非劳动人民的家庭，资产阶级的思想和习惯的影响还相当浓厚。如果这些大学生不抓紧一切时机把这些肮脏的东西从头脑中挤掉，消灭干净，那么他们凑在一起，自然言不及义（社会主义）。不会关心工农业生产和工农的生活，只能津津乐道于个人的名利，眼光愈来愈短浅，生活圈子愈来愈狭小。和资本主义长久相处，而“不闻其臭”，与工人阶级知识分子的距离更远了，与社会主义格格不入了。这样就会等不到你想突击补一下政治，“红”一下的时候，都早已成为“白”的了，甚至过去曾经染的一些“红色”，也会被冲扫得一干二净。这正像自然界中的生物一样，如果它能正常地进行新陈代谢，它就能够健康地壮大成长；如果它见不到阳光，得不到空气、水和养料，它就必然会枯萎腐烂。不是向上进步，就是后退，绝对的静止不动是没有的。例如有一些大学生他们原来主张“先专后红”，不关心政治，但是，他们头脑中原来就有的一套资产阶级政治观点并没有清除掉，而是在暗自发展，当右派向党进攻时，有的对资产阶级民主自由很感兴趣，有共鸣，迷失了方向，有的则大关心起资产阶级的政治，堕落成右派分子，并且很快地和其他右派分子联合在一起向党猖狂地进攻，这些难道不是主张“先专后红”的学生的前车之鉴吗？
    也许有些学生会这样说：“不是所有不肯改造思想的人都会成为右派，只要不是右派，不是一样可以为社会主义服务吗？”的确，右派分子只是少数，他们自然不会为社会主义忠诚服务，这里不必多说。但是，是不是除了右派分子以外，所有生活在社会主义社会里的人就注定了必然会为社会主义忠诚服务呢？事实证明并不是这样的。
    不容否认，一般大学生都有或多或少的资产阶级个人主义思想，如果在学校里学习时他们还舍不得割掉这条丑恶的、累赘的尾巴，对党和社会主义半心半意、三心二意，那么我们又怎能相信他们到工作岗位以后会全心全意为人民服务呢？显然这是不可能的。例如医学院有的学生实习时只对疑难病例有兴趣，认为是“输入”，对一般病例则不感兴趣，认为是“输出”，能推就推。这些学生当他们毕了业，有了“资本”（知识、技术等）以后，就会和人民讲价钱，并且他们的“资本”愈大时，讨的价钱就会愈高。我曾经听说过这样一件事：一个医学院的毕业生，当他作了医生以后，他并没有感念党和国家培育之恩，而是把他在学校学得的东西看成私有财产，自恃有了“资本”，向人民讨价钱了，并且恬不知耻地说：“过去一个医生每月可以赚一千多元，我说什么别人都得听，而现在每月才一百多元。”显然，对这个生活在社会主义社会里的学生说来，根本谈不到为社会主义忠诚服务的问题，离“俯首甘为孺子牛”的革命精神更是相距了十万八千里，而成了社会主义大学里的“半废品”，枉费了劳动人民的血汗。当然，劳动人民是不会甘心再培养这样的资产阶级货色了。
    思想改造是很艰巨的，必须经常和资产阶级思想作斗争，必须经过长期的实践锻炼和考验才能“兴无灭资”，作一个真正的红色专家——工人阶级的知识分子，幻想寻找一条“捷径”，突击染一下红色是不成的。我们相信绝大多数学生都会遵照共产党和毛主席所指引的正确方向，走上“又红又专”的光明大道，以新中国第一批的红色专家出现在人民的面前，而不再重复旧社会知识分子不得已走的那条又曲折、又痛苦的道路。
