    Heroic Road
    —Inspired by the Official Opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway
    Deng Tuo
    A great artery of steel, 668.2 kilometers long, is pulsating between the high mountains and deep valleys, and the fertile plains of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces in the heart of our country—this is the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. It is also like a giant of steel, with its feet firmly planted on the treacherous Qinling and Daba Mountains, and its arms embracing the rich Guanzhong Plain and the western Sichuan Plain. It connects and infuses fresh blood into the vast mountainous areas and plains, and mobilizes all possible forces here to serve our country's great socialist cause. It grows in an era of heroes, and only our heroic motherland and heroic people can nurture this heroic road.

    I came to the Baoji-Chengdu Railway on the eve of the official opening of this heroic road that conquers natural barriers. All the staff and workers along the line and guests from all over the country were excitedly talking about the history of struggle of this railway. The State Acceptance Committee announced with satisfaction: the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has been fully accepted and will be officially put into operation immediately. What a difficult and complex struggle this was!

    What great significance does the construction of such a railway have for the development of our national economy? This question has already been explained in many articles. The question I want to explain now is: how has the Baoji-Chengdu Railway successfully conquered nature? How has it effectively trained and improved mankind's power to conquer nature, while at the same time transforming people themselves?

    Looking at the many dangerous terrains and geological conditions along this railway line, it is not difficult for us to understand that the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is a rare railway in the history of railway construction at home and abroad. It deserves to be called a heroic road without any shame! The northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, 94 kilometers long, passes through the Qinling Mountains and the upper reaches of the Jialing River. This is an ancient glacial area and a level seven seismic zone. The weathering of rock formations is very serious, the rock joints are damaged, there is a lot of groundwater, and there are many ancient landslides in the valleys. The middle section, 65 *li* long, runs along the cliffs on both sides of the Jialing River. Ancient plank roads passed through here. This section is still in a level seven or six seismic zone, and there are also many ancient landslides at the foot of the mountains and by the water. Is it possible to build a railway under such geological conditions? It is said that a geologist once determined that railways could not be built in the Qinling area. Now the facts have completely broken this arbitrary conclusion and made a positive answer that is contrary to it. Is there anyone who still doubts this fact now? Then please come to the Baoji-Chengdu Railway to visit!

    Our Party and the People's Government, after comprehensive consideration of the plan to build the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, have always been unswervingly fighting for its realization. Although we had foreseen the serious difficulties that might be encountered, the sons and daughters of our great motherland, all the fighters loyal to the socialist cause, would never bow their heads in the face of any difficulties. Starting from "July 1st" in 1952, local party and government cadres from various provinces and counties, veteran railway workers, demobilized troops from the People's Liberation Army, engineering corps returning victoriously from the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and a large number of new workers who had just left the countryside, successively joined the great struggle to build the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. They experienced countless obstacles and finally completed the plan. Even in some projects with very bad geological conditions, the efforts to eliminate natural diseases have achieved great results. The conclusion of the State Acceptance Committee is: the engineering quality of the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is excellent, the engineering quality of the middle section is good, and the engineering quality of the southern section is excellent. The entire line meets the standards of a secondary railway. A secondary railway is one that carries no more than two million tons of cargo per year, while a primary railway carries more than two million tons of cargo per year. Primary and secondary railways are both trunk lines of the national railway system. They are designated with different carrying capacities based on the needs of the national economy. There is no difference in engineering quality standards between the two. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway, as a railway trunk line connecting Northwest and Southwest China and connecting with other national trunk lines, has significant strategic importance and economic value.

    However, the birth of this railway is filled with heroic triumphs on the one hand, and the pain of childbirth on the other. This is very natural. Comrade Xiong Yuzhong, who was responsible for commanding the entire Baoji-Chengdu Railway project, told me: The state has given us such an important task. As Communist Party members, we have the confidence to overcome all difficulties. We have carried out a cruel struggle with nature. We have come to realize that nature is a stubborn and cunning enemy. We must constantly improve our skills and fight it to finally defeat it. I think Comrade Xiong Yuzhong is right. The fact that the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was successfully built shows that our people have learned many skills in their struggle against revolutionary enemies. Now, in order to fight against nature, we must relearn a set of skills. And all these skills, as long as our people have the determination and are willing to work hard, they will definitely be able to learn.

    From the perspective of railway construction engineering, many veteran engineers say that the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is the most complete university. It concentrates various typical terrains and special geological conditions, bringing special experience to exploration, design, construction, and operation management, which is rare in the history of railway construction at home and abroad. For example, the railway tracks in the Qinling Mountains are winding and circuitous, with five layers up and down, forming a complex state of three horseshoe shapes and an "8" shape. In the middle of the "8" shape, there is also a mountain ditch that is 60 meters wide and 600 meters long, with twelve tunnel entrances and seven bridges under construction simultaneously on four layers up and down. The complexity of this engineering technology can only be seen on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

    The application of advanced Soviet engineering technology on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has also achieved very prominent results. A large blast on the mountain is an example. Especially directed blasting, with miraculous effect. For example, at the Lijiagou on the Jialing River, the mountain is winding and the river water originally meanders down in an S shape. If the railway is to pass through here, it is necessary to build large bridges and culverts. With the help of Soviet experts, directed blasting was carried out. The mountain was blown down at once, and according to the designated direction, it filled the curved riverbed, so that the river immediately changed its course and flowed straight down. Similarly, the Qingshi Cliff in the Qinling Mountains was originally a steep mountain peak. If the railway is to pass through here, there will be no station, and it is also necessary to build a large tunnel and a large bridge. Using the Soviet method of large blasting, the mountain peak was blasted flat at once, and the collapsed gravel filled the valley. The railway has both an appropriate station here, and saves the construction of tunnels and bridges, and the completion time is also advanced. The miracle of "high mountains bowing their heads and rivers making way" that people often say has been truly realized on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

    There is also a more complicated set of methods for fighting nature, which is used to deal with the ancient landslides with bad geological conditions. For example, Tanjiazhuang, Matiawan, etc. on the Jialing River were originally unstable landslide areas. In order to prevent the sliding of the foundation, it is necessary to drain the groundwater to make the slope dry and stable. The Engineering Bureau used various methods to build interception ditches, drainage ditches, small gullies, drainage caves and infiltration wells, etc., to drain the groundwater as much as possible. In some places, drainage caves were even excavated more than 30 meters deep under the roadbed, leading directly to the Jialing River. This stabilized the slope and consolidated the roadbed. Many engineers and experts believe that it is rare to see so many complex geological conditions appearing at the same time except for the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

    In the process of fighting nature, a large number of outstanding technical talents will inevitably be trained, and rich technical experience will be accumulated. Such talents cannot be trained in schools, and such experience cannot be found in any books. "From not knowing to knowing" is the mantra of the vast number of staff and workers participating in the Baoji-Chengdu Railway project, and it is also a true reflection of the process of people understanding and mastering objective laws. Comrade Li Rongcun, who is responsible for the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway project, told me: At first, no one had any experience. The newly established stall had very low technical and management levels. Except for a few veteran workers, 80% were farmers from the countryside and urban poor. Many farmers had never even seen a railway. They had to temporarily learn some simple operations, participate in labor, and continue to improve at the same time. In this way, a large engineering and technical team was slowly cultivated. Now the strength of this technical team is quite strong. It should be said that this is the most valuable asset of our country.

    Among those I saw on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway were Comrade Li Zhentian, a technician promoted from veteran workers, and many old technical personnel who had been tested in practice. They were on the construction site day and night, constantly tempered in the furnace of the working class's mass struggle, and constantly ideologically and politically transformed themselves. Engineer Liu Hongye used his own experience to illustrate that in the old society, the strength of technical personnel could not be brought into play, and it was only after liberation that they were truly able to engage in railway engineering. He said that now he truly understands what the people's railway cause is. Engineer Fu Anshi recalled that when he first arrived at the Qinling construction site in December 1953, the Party called for the use of vertical shaft methods to excavate tunnels, and he thought that this would definitely not be possible. Because he did not believe that excavating a tunnel by hitting a vertical shaft from the top of the mountain, and extending from the bottom of the well to the front and rear points, could avoid deviations. But he was wrong, and the vertical shaft was successfully opened. Engineer Zhang Yexin compared the new and old railway projects and said: In 1943, it took 700 people two and a half years to open a 330-meter tunnel on the Qian-Gui Railway line, but now it takes more than 300 people less than a year to open a 402-meter tunnel. How can this not convince people? Engineer Pang Zhendong said that he admired the mass line working method the most. He said that the construction of each tunnel or bridge often goes through fierce debates between positive and negative opinions before it is finalized. Now any project on the line has a large number of original materials and records of different opinions, which is a very valuable living textbook. As for the rationalization proposals of the workers, their correctness sometimes exceeded the opinions of the engineers. From the conversations of these many engineering and technical personnel, we can clearly see how powerfully practice changes people's thinking and understanding, and how great a force actual struggle is in transforming people themselves!

    When the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is officially opened to traffic, the reporter hopes that the relevant units such as the railway department, the geological department, the scientific research institutions and the engineering technical schools will further strengthen their close cooperation, collect and sort out all the original materials of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway without any omission, and add investigations and supplements to those that are insufficient, and compile systematic scientific data; establish a special exhibition hall, and concentrate all the physical objects together; and systematically and in detail summarize all the experiences of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, and rotate cadres to study here, so as to further improve the existing technical level and further develop and strengthen the existing technical strength.

    英雄的路
    ——宝成铁路正式通车有感
    邓拓
    有一条六百六十八点二公里的钢铁的大动脉，正在我国腹部陕、甘、川三省的高山深谷与平川沃野之间跃动，这就是宝成铁路。它又像是一个钢铁的巨人，两脚踏住了险恶的秦岭和大巴山，两手拥抱着富饶的秦川和川西平原。它为广大的山区人民与平川人民沟通着和灌注着新鲜的血液；并且发动着这里的一切可能的力量，为我国伟大的社会主义事业服务。它生长在英雄的时代，只有我们英雄的祖国和英雄的人民，才能养育这英雄的路。
    我来到宝成路上，正当这个征服天险的英雄的路就要正式通车的前夕。全线职工和各地来宾，都兴高采烈地谈论着这条铁路的斗争史。国家验收委员会满意地宣布：宝成路全线验收完毕，即日正式营运。这是经过多么艰巨复杂的斗争的结果啊！
    兴建这样的一条铁路，对于我国国民经济的发展具有何等巨大的意义？这个问题，在许多文章中已经做了说明。我现在要说明的问题是：宝成路怎样成功地征服着自然？它又怎样有效地锻炼和提高了人类征服自然的力量，同时改造了人们自己？
    看看这条铁路线上许多险恶的地形和地质条件，我们就不难了解，宝成路是中外铁路建筑史上罕见的一条铁路，它称得起是英雄的路而绝无愧色！宝成铁路北段九十四公里，通过秦岭和嘉陵江上游，这是古代冰川地带，又是七级的地震区域，岩层风化现象十分严重，岩石节理破坏，地下水多，河谷中有许多古老的滑坡。中段六十五华里，沿着嘉陵江两侧几乎都是悬崖绝壁，古代的栈道由这里经过，这一段仍然处于七级或六级地震区，山脚水边也有许多古老的滑坡。在这样的地质条件下能不能兴建铁路呢？据说从前有一个地质学家断定秦岭地区是不能兴修铁路的。现在事实已经完全打破了这种武断的结论，做出了与它相反的肯定的回答。试问现在还有谁怀疑这个事实的吗？那就请他到宝成路上来参观吧！
    我们的党和人民政府对于建设宝成铁路的计划，经过全面考虑以后，就始终坚定不移地为它的实现而奋斗。虽然早已预见到可能遭遇的严重困难，但是我们伟大祖国的儿女们，一切忠于社会主义事业的战士，是决不肯在任何困难面前低头的。从1952年的“七一”开始，来自各个省县的地方党政工作干部、老铁路职工、人民解放军转业部队和抗美援朝胜利归来的工程总队，以及刚刚离开农村的大批新工人，就陆续地投入了建筑宝成路的伟大斗争。他们经历了无数的险阻，终于完成了计划。即便是在地质条件很坏的若干工程上，消除自然病害的努力也已经收到了巨大的成效。国家验收委员会的结论是：宝成路北段工程质量优良，中段工程质量良好，南段工程质量优良，全线符合二级铁路的标准。所谓二级铁路就是全年载重不超过二百万吨的，而一级铁路的全年载重量则超过了二百万吨。一级和二级的铁路都是全国铁路的干线，它们是根据国民经济的需要分别规定不同的载重量，两者之间在工程质量标准上是没有差别的。而宝成路作为贯通我国西北和西南的铁路干线，并且同全国其他干线衔接起来，这是有重大的战略意义和经济价值的。
    但是，这一条铁路的诞生，一方面充满了英雄的凯歌，另一方面也不免引起了临产的痛苦。这是很自然的。负责指挥宝成路全线工程的熊宇忠同志对我说：国家交给我们这样重大的任务，作为共产党员，我们有信心战胜一切困难，我们同自然界进行了残酷的斗争，我们认识了自然界是一个顽强狡猾的敌人，我们必须不断地提高自己的本领，同它斗法，才能最后战胜它。我认为熊宇忠同志的话是正确的。宝成路建设成功的这个事实表明，我们的人在同革命的敌人作斗争中已经学会了许多本领；现在向自然界进行斗争，必须重新学会一套本领；而所有这些本领，只要我们的人有决心，肯努力，就一定能够学会。
    从铁路建筑工程的角度来看，许多老工程师都说，宝成铁路是一所最完备的大学。这里集中了各种典型的地形和地质的特殊情况，给勘探、设计、施工以及经营管理等各方面都带来特殊的经验，为中外铁路建筑史上所罕有。例如在秦岭上的铁路轨道，盘旋曲折，上下五层，构成了三个马蹄形和一个“8”字形的错综状态；在“8”字形的中间，还有一个宽六十公尺、长六百公尺的山沟，上下四层有十二个隧道口和七座桥梁同时施工。这种工程技术的复杂性只有在宝成路上才能见到。
    苏联的先进工程技术在宝成路上的运用也有很突出的成就。对山头举行大爆破便是一个例子。特别是指向大爆破，功效如神。如在嘉陵江上的李家河，山势迂回，江水本来像S形蜿蜒而下，铁路要通过这里就必须架设大桥和涵洞。由于苏联专家的帮助，实行了指向大爆破，这座山头一次就被炸倒，并且按照指定的方向，填塞了弯曲的河床，使江水立刻改道，直流而下。同样，秦岭上的青石崖本来是峻峭的山峰，铁路要通过这里不但没有站场，并且还需要建筑一座大隧道和一座大桥。采用苏联大爆破的方法，一下就把山峰炸平了，崩裂的砂石填平了山谷，铁路通过这里既有适当的站场，又节省了隧道和桥梁的建筑工程，完工的时间也提前了。人们常说的“高山低头，河水让路”的奇迹，在宝成路上真正实现了。
    还有更复杂的向自然界作斗争的一套方法，是用来对付地质条件恶劣的古老滑坡的。例如嘉陵江边的谈家庄、马蹄湾等处，本来是不稳定的滑坡地带。要想制止地基的滑动，必须排泄地下水，使边坡干固稳定。工程局用了种种方法，修建截水沟、引水沟、小型窝沟、泄水窝洞和渗井等，尽量使地下水排出。有的地方甚至在路基下面三十多公尺的深处挖掘泄水洞，直通嘉陵江。这样就稳定了边坡，巩固了路基。许多工程师和专家都认为，多种复杂的地质情况同时出现，这除了宝成路以外，别处是很少见的。
    在同自然界斗法的过程中，必然会锻炼出大批优秀的技术人材，积累丰富的技术经验。这样的人材是关在学校里培养不出来的，这样的经验也是任何书本上找不到的。“从不懂到懂”，这是参加宝成路工程的广大职工的口头禅，也是人们认识和掌握客观规律的真实过程的反映。负责宝成路北段工程的李荣村同志告诉我：最初谁也没有经验，新成立的摊子，技术和管理水平都很低。除了少数老工人以外，80％是来自农村的农民和城市贫民，有许多农民连铁路都没有见过，只好临时学一点简单的操作，一面参加劳动，一面继续提高。这样慢慢地就培养出来了很大的工程技术队伍。现在这个技术队伍的力量已经是相当强大的了，这应该说是我们国家最宝贵的一份财富。
    我在宝成路上见到的有从老工人中提拔出来的技师李振田同志，也有许多经过实际考验的老技术人员。他们日日夜夜在工地上，在工人阶级群众斗争的洪炉中，不断地得到锻炼，不断地从思想上和政治上改造了自己。工程师刘宏业用他自己的经历说明，在旧社会里，技术人员的力量不能发挥，真正干铁路工程还是解放以后的事情。他说现在才真正懂得什么是人民铁道事业。工程师傅安石回忆1953年12月才到秦岭工地的时候，党号召用竖井的方法开挖隧道，他想这一定做不成。因为他不相信从山顶打下一个竖井，由井底引伸出前后两点，挖出隧道能够不发生偏差。但是他的想法错了，竖井开成功了。工程师张业鑫以新旧铁路工程做对比说：1943年在黔桂铁路线上要开一个三百三十公尺的隧道，七百人花了两年半的时间没有做成，现在开一个四百零二公尺的隧道，三百多人不到一年就打通了，这怎么能够叫人不心悦诚服呢？工程师庞振东表示，他最佩服群众路线的工作方法。他说，每一个隧道或桥梁的兴修，往往经过正面和反面意见的激烈争论然后才确定下来，如今线路上任何一个工程都有大批原始资料和不同意见的记录，这是非常难得的活的教材。至于工人群众的合理化建议，它的正确性有时还超过了工程师的意见。从这许多工程技术人员的谈话里，我们可以很清楚地看到，实践多么有力地改变着人们的思想认识，实际斗争是改造人们自己的多么巨大的力量啊！
    当着宝成路正式通车的时候，记者希望铁道部门、地质部门、科学研究机关和工程技术学校等有关单位，进一步密切的合作，把宝成路的一切原始材料毫不遗漏地收集和整理起来，不够的加以调查补充，编成系统的科学资料；设立专门的陈列馆，把一切实物也集中在一起；并且要系统地详细地总结宝成路的全部经验，轮流调派干部到这里学习，使现有的技术水平进一步提高，使现有的技术力量进一步发展壮大起来。
