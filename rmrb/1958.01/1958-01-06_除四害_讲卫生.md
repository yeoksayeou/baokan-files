Eliminate the Four Pests, Emphasize Hygiene

    A mass patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests is gradually unfolding in Xi'an. Since the campaign began on December 25th of last year, the city has eliminated more than 30,000 rats, 60,000 sparrows, and nearly 100 catties of overwintering mosquitoes and flies. In order to launch a high tide of the patriotic health campaign, the city carefully inspected the sanitation of factories, organizations, schools, streets, alleys, and agricultural cooperatives on the 4th. The inspection showed that the masses in Xi'an have been well mobilized, and many places have taken on a new look. Even the places with the worst conditions can do a good job in sanitation.
