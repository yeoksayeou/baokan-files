The people of Okinawa Have Sharp Eyes
By Our Commentator

After the U.S. military occupation authorities in Okinawa forced Naha Mayor Kamejiro Senaga out of office, in the subsequent mayoral election for Naha, Saichi Kaneshi, who opposed the U.S. occupation of Okinawa, defeated Tatsuo Taira, who favored the continued presence of U.S. troops in Okinawa, and was elected mayor. U.S. news agencies, clearly with displeasure, admitted that this was another vote by the people of Okinawa demanding that the "Yankees go home"!

Saichi Kaneshi was the candidate nominated by the "Liaison Council for Supporting Democracy," which included the Okinawa People's Party. His main campaign platform was: to defend peace and oppose the United States turning Okinawa into a nuclear weapons base; and to demand the immediate return of Okinawa to Japan. Saichi Kaneshi's victory in the election shows that the platform he put forward represents the trend of the people's hearts in Okinawa. But the issue is not just about the campaign platform. Tatsuo Taira, who was strongly supported by the United States, also put forward fine-sounding slogans such as "abolish undemocratic power and ensure freedom." The Social Masses Party, which nominated him as a candidate, also issued a statement expressing "resistance" to the U.S. military authorities' announcement of amending the local autonomy law and the election law (Senaga was forced to step down after the U.S. military authorities announced the amendment of these laws). However, the people of Okinawa "listen to their words and observe their actions" and have not been deceived by hypocritical words. They elected Saichi Kaneshi, who once stood with Senaga and has always fought against the U.S. occupation; and rejected Tatsuo Taira, who was strongly supported by the U.S. military occupation authorities. This shows that the people's eyes are sharp, they are good at distinguishing between truth and falsehood, and they have clear likes and dislikes.

The election of Saichi Kaneshi is a new and serious blow to the U.S. aggressors' attempt to occupy Okinawa for a long time and turn it into a permanent U.S. war base. Before this election, the U.S. military occupation authorities in Okinawa had instigated a group of reactionary forces to carry out despicable divisive activities against the democratic and progressive forces. The Ryukyu Bank, controlled by the United States, had also carried out intimidation in advance, announcing that if Saichi Kaneshi was elected, it would continue to freeze U.S. aid funds for Naha's municipal construction, and treat Kaneshi in the same way as it treated Senaga. The U.S. military occupation authorities in Okinawa were confident that under such control and interference, the election of the pro-American Tatsuo Taira was "a sure win." But the result was exactly the opposite. This can only show that the upsurge of the Okinawan people's anti-American struggle has developed to the point where it cannot be controlled by the U.S. military occupation authorities using deception and coercion.

However, the U.S. aggressors will not give up. After the results of the Naha city election were announced, the United States stated that it did not intend to change any policies or practices in the administration of Okinawa, and the policy of seizing land from the Okinawan people to expand military bases would continue to be implemented. This means that what lies ahead for the new Naha Mayor Saichi Kaneshi and the people of Okinawa will be an even more arduous struggle.

    冲绳人民的眼睛是雪亮的
    本报评论员
    冲绳岛美军占领当局迫使那霸市长濑长龟次郎去职以后，在继任那霸市长的竞选斗争中，反对美国占领冲绳的兼次佐一战胜了赞成美军留驻冲绳的平良辰雄而当选为市长。美国通讯社显然怀着并不愉快的心情承认：这是冲绳人民再次投票要求“美国佬滚回去”！
    兼次佐一是由有冲绳人民党参加的“拥护民主主义联络协议会”提名的候选人。他的主要竞选纲领是：保卫和平，反对美国把冲绳岛变成核武器基地；要求立即把冲绳岛归还日本。兼次佐一在竞选中获得胜利，说明他提出的纲领是代表冲绳民心趋向的。但问题还不仅仅在于竞选纲领。为美国大力支持的平良辰雄也曾提出“废除不民主的权力，确保自由”之类的好听的口号，提名他为候选人的社会大众党也曾发表声明，表示对美军当局宣布修改地方自治法和选举法一举（濑长就是在美军当局宣布修改这些法律之后被迫去职的），要加以“抵抗”。但是，冲绳人民“听其言而察其行”，绝没有为虚伪的言词所迷惑。他们选举了曾经和濑长站在一起，一向为反对美国占领而斗争的兼次佐一；摈弃了为美军占领当局所大力支持的平良辰雄。这说明人民的眼睛是雪亮的，他们善于分辨真伪，而且爱憎分明。
    兼次佐一的当选，对美国侵略者长期占领冲绳，把它变成美国的永久战争基地的企图，是一个新的严重打击。冲绳美军占领当局在这次选举之前，就曾经唆使一伙反动势力对民主进步力量进行卑劣的分化活动。美国控制下的琉球银行事先也曾进行恫吓，它宣布：如果兼次佐一当选，它就将继续冻结美国对那霸市政建设的援助基金，像对付濑长一样来对待兼次。冲绳美军占领当局满以为在这样的控制和干涉之下，亲美的平良辰雄的当选是“胜算在握”的。但结果恰恰相反。这只能说明，冲绳人民反美斗争情绪的高涨，已经发展到了不是美军占领当局用欺骗和高压手段所能控制的地步。
    但是，美国侵略者是不会甘休的。在那霸市选举揭晓以后，美国已经表示，它不打算改变在冲绳岛行政方面的任何政策或作法，为扩充军事基地而夺取冲绳人民土地的政策将继续执行。这就是说，摆在新任那霸市长兼次佐一和冲绳人民面前的，将是更加艰巨的斗争。
