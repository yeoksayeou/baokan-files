People who love the Yangtze River brand accordions probably imagine that the Chongqing Musical Instrument Factory, which produces this nationally renowned, high-quality product in large quantities, must be a magnificent place with beautiful and sophisticated equipment. However, I recently visited this factory and discovered that only six years ago, it had only one broken lathe, a few files, and five workers.

It has developed through the diligence, frugality, and hard work of its employees. Over the past five years, the factory has only spent 280,000 yuan in national investment, yet it has increased production by more than 50 times, becoming the only factory in China specializing in accordions and accounting for 40% of the national output. Despite this, the factory's buildings and equipment are surprisingly simple and outdated.

Walking into the factory area, no one would think it was a factory. There is no factory sign at the gate, nor any building that looks like a workshop. The factory is located in a very special place, on a steep cliff, 20 or 30 zhang high, beside the Yangtze River. The main factory buildings are old offices and warehouses left over from the Kuomintang government, as well as air-raid shelters, and some simple stilt houses built with bamboo. The workshops converted from these buildings are truly bizarre: some are triangular, some are semi-circular, some are willow-shaped, and some are simply irregular air-raid shelters. Many workshops are so low that a tall person can reach the ceiling.

The employees have made the most of the buildings. In the corrugated box workshop, I saw ropes hanging from the roof trusses, suspending a large number of newly made corrugated boxes. I learned that this process was expanding, but the workshop remained the same size, so they had to develop upwards. Even more special, in the factory corridors, corners, administrative offices, and even the director's office, I saw tuning workers stepping on their machines, tuning away. The director and other cadres were working calmly beside them. The tuning workers told me that they didn't have fixed workshops at all. They just moved their machines to wherever there was space.

There are dozens of machines in the workshops, most of which are very old. It is understood that in the past five years, the factory has only spent 90,000 yuan to buy seven urgently needed machines. The rest were all renovated by employees using discarded equipment and materials.

Employee housing and other welfare facilities are even more makeshift. In the past five years, the factory has only invested 40,000 yuan to buy a batch of very old bundled houses as employee dormitories, which are only enough to accommodate about 20% of the factory's employees. The rest, including the head of the Party branch, all rent houses outside.

It is commendable that this factory is still operating so diligently and frugally today, when it is undergoing such rapid development. However, when the reporter heard the old workers talk about their years of hard work, revolutionary spirit, and building their enterprise from scratch, it felt even more commendable.

While interviewing Rui Shaoyun, the factory's oldest worker, I asked: "Master Rui, did you know how to make accordions before?"

"Before? Are you talking about before this factory was established? At that time, I had never even seen an accordion factory. In the past, we didn't have factories that specialized in making accordions. This factory only started making accordions in 1951. At that time, there were only five of us repairing musical instruments. As for equipment, we only had a few files and a broken lathe."

"Without experts, lacking equipment and funds, how did you start the factory?"

"A foreign accordion was our teacher," Master Rui said interestingly. "At first, everyone disassembled all the parts of this accordion and carefully studied and imitated them one by one. It wasn't easy. Every time we made a part and assembled a kind of accordion, we often failed dozens of times. I remember when I first assembled an 18-bass accordion in 1952, I worked day and night, assembling and disassembling, again and again. I can't remember how many times I assembled and disassembled it, but it must have been dozens of times. Several times, I finally managed to assemble it almost correctly, but when I gave it to an expert to play, some said that the sound was like mosquitoes buzzing, and others said that it sounded like a reed organ, not an accordion at all. Speaking of making parts, let's take the reed, an important part of the accordion, as an example. At first, we didn't even know what kind of copper it was made of. We had to take the reed from the foreign accordion to a large factory for analysis to find out. Then, everyone carefully studied the lines on the reed, listened carefully to its sound, and constantly pondered and tried it out countless times. It took a long time to slowly figure it out. It turns out that there is so much to making a good-sounding reed. The copper sheet has to be punched, ground, quenched, and polished with a grinding wheel..."

Speaking of grinding wheels, Master Rui recalled a story: "To make the reeds sound accurately when installed on the reed frame, they had to be precisely thinned to the right thickness with fine tools. For a long time, everyone used heavy files to repair them, which was extremely inefficient and difficult to make standard. Everyone was constantly thinking about this technical problem at any time and place. Once, a technician passed by a denture shop and saw a dentist using a grinding wheel to repair teeth, making them so even and smooth. This inspired him: 'Wouldn't it be great to use this to repair reeds?' He quickly came back and told everyone, and everyone immediately found discarded materials to install a grinding wheel. This not only made the quality of the repaired reeds very good, but also improved work efficiency dozens of times."

"It seems that you need more mechanical equipment," I interrupted Master Rui.

"That's right, but we didn't have much money to buy equipment at that time. The punching machines, grinding machines, grinding wheel machines, etc., used to make reeds that I just mentioned were all obtained by sending people to run around to many units to find discarded items from others, and then finding ways to match parts and assemble jigs. That's how we gradually repaired and assembled dozens of large and small machines and equipment that are now used in the factory. As for the equipment we used at the beginning, it was even simpler. For example, for quenching, at first everyone installed bellows in the open air, picked up some stones and mud to build a stove, and added an iron pot. This was all our quenching equipment. In the first two years, we not only couldn't afford to add equipment, but we couldn't even afford some metal materials, so we had to piece them together. Take the reeds as an example again. In the first two or three years, we relied on going out to collect scrap copper to maintain production, collecting several thousand kilograms in total."

"In addition to technology, equipment, and funds, there were many other difficulties encountered," Master Rui changed the topic.

"In 1952, the factory officially started producing 170 accordions, but because many technical problems were not solved, only a few unsightly accordions were assembled in the first half of the year. Because the products were not shipped out, we couldn't buy materials, the workers' wages couldn't be paid, and even the mess hall didn't have money to buy rice. At this time, the superiors provided us with loan support and repeatedly encouraged us. Everyone put in a lot of enthusiasm to desperately study technology, and finally overfulfilled the task in the second half of the year. From 1953 to 1954, our sales opened up, and production expanded more than tenfold. However, because the product quality fell behind the user's requirements, a major difficulty of a large backlog of products occurred again in 1955, and we were forced to stop production for more than a month. From the second half of this year, we put in a lot of effort to revolutionize the quality. Over the past two years, we have made many major reforms to the internal structure, appearance, and variety of the accordions. We have successively made nine varieties and twenty-four beautiful patterns of accordions. Last year, we won quality awards for sound and appearance at the national musical instrument conference. Since 1956, our Yangtze River brand accordions have been in short supply in the national market. Last year, our accordions were also sold abroad."

    白手兴家的重庆乐器厂
    新华社记者　胡明俊
    喜爱长江牌手风琴的人们，大概会联想到，大量生产这种全国驰名的优质产品的重庆乐器厂，它的规模是多么宏伟、厂房设备是多么漂亮精致吧。记者最近访问了这个厂。原来它在六年前只有一部破车床，几把锉刀，五个工人。
    它是在职工们克勤克俭、艰苦奋斗中发展起来的。五年来，全厂只花了国家二十八万元建设投资，却使生产提高了五十多倍，成为我国专产手风琴的、产量占全国40％的工厂。尽管这样，现在全厂的厂房和设备还是出人意外的简陋和陈旧。
    走进厂区，谁也不会想到这儿是个工厂。大门前既没挂厂牌，也没有一栋像车间的房屋。厂址很特别，座落在长江旁边一片陡险的二三十丈高的山崖上。主要厂房是国民党机关留下的破旧办公房、仓库和防空洞，另外是些竹料搭的很简陋的吊脚捆绑房。这些房屋改成的车间真是奇形怪状，有的三角形，有的半圆形，有的柳条形，有的就是不规则的防空洞。许多工房低得连高个子伸手就摸得到顶。
    职工们利用房屋真达到了最大限度。在折皱箱工序的工房里，我看到屋架上满系绳索，吊着才做出来的大批折皱箱，一问，才知道这个工序因任务不断增大，厂房还是那么一间，只好向空间发展。更特别的是，在厂房过道上、屋角边、行政办公室、厂长室，都见到调音工人踏着机器，在咿咿呜呜地调音，厂长、干部们安然在旁办公。调音工人告诉我，他们根本没有固定工房，每天见那儿有空，就把机器搬到那儿干活。
    车间的大小机器有几十部，大都很陈旧。据了解，五年来厂里只花九万元买了七部急需的机器，其余全是职工用废旧设备材料装修的。
    职工住宅和其他福利设备，更是因陋就简。五年中这个厂只花了四万元投资，买了一批很旧的捆绑房做职工宿舍，只够容纳全厂20％左右的职工，其余的人包括党总支负责人，全是在外租房子住。
    这个厂在大发展的今天，还这么克勤克俭地经营生产，是难能可贵的，可是，当记者听到老工人们谈起他们几年来艰苦奋斗、白手兴家的革命干劲，觉得更加难能可贵了。
    在访问厂里最老的工人芮绍云时，我问：“芮师傅，你从前会造手风琴吗？”
    “从前？你是说这个厂开办前吗？那时我连手风琴厂还没见过呢。过去，我们就没有专造手风琴的厂。1951年，这个厂才动手做手风琴。那时，只有我和另外四个修理乐器的工人。设备吗，就是几柄锉刀，一部破车床。”
    “没有内行，缺乏设备和资金，你们怎么把厂办起来的？”
    “一架外国手风琴，就是我们的师傅。”芮师傅有趣地说，“起初，大伙把这架琴的全部零件拆下来，一件件细细琢磨、仿做。不容易呀，每做成一个零件部件，装好一种琴，常常要遭到十几次、几十次的失败。记得1952年我初次装十八贝斯的琴，不分白天黑夜地干，装了不对又拆，拆了又装，闹了几个月，装拆次数记不清了，总有好几十次吧。有几次好容易装得差不多了，拿给内行一拉，有的说，声音就像蚊子叫；有的说，这像脚风琴嘛，那像手风琴的调儿呢。说起做零部件，就拿琴上的重要部件簧片来说吧。开初，连它是什么铜做的也不知道，还是把外国琴的簧片拿到大厂化验，才明白的。随后，大家细心琢磨簧片上的刀丝纹路，审听它的发音，不断揣摩，无数次试做，好久好久，才慢慢摸出。原来做块发音好听的簧片，明堂真多哪。要将铜片用冲床冲，磨床磨，淬火，砂轮打磨……。”
    谈到砂轮，芮师傅想起段故事来：要簧片安在簧框上发出各种很准的音，还得用精细工具把它修得厚薄刚巧合适。好长时期，大家都是拿笨重的锉刀修，工效慢得要命，又难锉得标准。大伙随时随地都在为这个技术问题动脑筋。一次，一个技术员经过镶牙店，看到镶牙师正用砂轮修牙，修得那么匀细、平整，这事启发了他：“用这家伙修簧片不很好吗”？他连忙回来宣传，大家即刻找废器材安装砂轮。这一来，不但修出的簧片质量很好，工效也提高了几十倍。
    “看起来，你们要用机械设备的地方还多呢，”我打断了芮师傅的话。
    “可不是，但我们那时哪有多的钱买设备。刚才讲的做簧片用的冲床、磨床、砂轮机等等，都是派人跑遍好多单位，找回别人废旧的东西，然后想法配零件、装工夹具。我们就是这么样，陆续修装了厂里现在使用的几十部大小机器设备。至于开初搞的设备，就更简单了，比如煎火，开始大伙就是在露天里安上风箱，拣些石头泥巴砌座炉灶，再加上口铁锅，这便是我们的全部淬火设备。头两年，我们不但添不起设备，连有些金属材料也买不起，只好东拼西凑。还是拿簧片做例，最初两三年就靠出去四处收罗废旧铜带来维持生产，一共收到好几千斤。”
    “除了技术、设备、资金以外，碰到的其他困难还多。”芮师傅转了话题。
    “1952年，厂里正式开始生产一百七十部手风琴，可是因为许多技术问题没有解决，上半年过去了，才装出几部不像样的琴来。产品没出厂，弄得材料买不进，大伙的工资发不出，甚至伙食团也没钱买米了。这时上级贷款支持我们，再三鼓励我们，大伙都拿出很大热情来拚命钻技术，终于在下半年超额完成了任务。1953年到1954年，我们的销路打开了，生产扩大了十几倍。但是因为产品质量落到用户要求的后面，到1955年又发生了产品大量积压的重大困难，被迫停产了一月多。从这年下半年起，我们用出很大干劲来革质量的命。两年多来，对琴的内部结构、外形、花色品种，都作了许多重大改革，先后做出九种品种、二十四种漂亮图案的琴来，去年在全国乐器会议上，得了音色、外观等质量优胜奖。从1956年以来，我们出的长江牌手风琴，也就一直在全国市场上供不应求。去年我们的琴还出国销售哪。”
