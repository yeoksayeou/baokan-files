    Questions and Answers on the Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme

    5. How many styles of Chinese phonetic alphabet letters are there?
    Latin letters have four styles: uppercase, lowercase, uppercase cursive, and lowercase cursive. Chinese phonetic alphabet letters also follow these four styles. First, let's talk about regular script, which is the printed form: A, B, C... are uppercase, a, b, c... are lowercase. Among the twenty-six letters, eight letters have exactly the same shape in uppercase and lowercase: Cc, Oo, Pp, Ss, Vv, Ww, Xx, Zz; four letters are basically the same: Kk, Mm, Uu, Yy; six letters are relatively similar and easy to identify: Bb, Hh, Ii, Jj, Nn, Tt; the remaining eight letters have larger differences, even completely different: Aa, Dd, Ee, Ff, Gg, Ll, Qq, Rr. Beginners of Latin letters can first learn lowercase letters, and after mastering all twenty-six lowercase letters, it will be easier to learn other styles. As for the handwritten form of Latin letters, i.e., uppercase and lowercase cursive, they can be written according to the general writing habits of Latin letters. In the future, a cursive model of Chinese phonetic alphabet letters should be compiled and printed for beginners of Latin letters to copy.
    Having four styles for one letter naturally adds some trouble to learning. Therefore, some people advocate adopting only one style, such as lowercase, without adopting the other three styles, or retaining uppercase and lowercase but changing some uppercase letters that differ in shape from lowercase letters to be consistent with lowercase letters to facilitate learning. This view is reasonable. However, uppercase Latin letters have their special uses and have become a worldwide habit. The first letter of proper nouns such as names of people and places should be capitalized, such as Lenin, Roma; chemical element symbols should be capitalized: hydrogen is H, nitrogen is N. Therefore, for a middle school student, even if the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme does not use uppercase letters, he still has to learn uppercase letters in textbooks of mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc. Since we adopt Latin letters, then acknowledging this international habit of Latin letters is beneficial to cultural and scientific exchange. As for some troubles in learning, they can be solved in the teaching sequence, for example, uppercase letters can be postponed from the first and second grades of elementary school to the third and fourth grades, just like the current elementary school language textbooks use regular script in the first six volumes and switch to Song typeface from the seventh volume.
    6. Why is it necessary to specify the names of the letters?
    The alphabet also specifies the names of the twenty-six Chinese phonetic alphabet letters. In addition to its pronunciation, a letter also has its name (the alphabet only specifies the names of the letters; the consonant and vowel tables only specify the pronunciations of the letters), just as a person has a name in addition to their job. The name is for easy reference and is the letter's "name," while the pronunciation is the actual sound of the letter when spelling, which is the letter's "job." For example, the name of the letter "h" is "ha," but its pronunciation is "h" (as in "喝" - hē). In English, for example, the name of the letter "c" is "see," but its pronunciation is "k" (as in "刻" - kè) or "s" (as in "思" - sī).
    Why not use the pronunciation of the letters as the names, so that the names are consistent with the pronunciations? It would certainly be easier to use the pronunciation as the name and avoid defining another name, but it has a major drawback: the pronunciation of consonant letters is generally not loud enough and not clear enough, making it inconvenient to pronounce them, and it is not easy to hear clearly from a distance or on the phone, and may even be misheard. Using "ha" as the name of "h" is naturally louder than the consonant of "喝" (hē). Why not use the names of the Zhuyin symbols as the names of the phonetic letters? Because the names of some Zhuyin symbols are also not loud enough. And there are no letters in Zhuyin symbols equivalent to "yw," so the names of these two letters must be defined separately. We naturally cannot use the names of English letters as the names of our set of letters, as the names of English letters are not compatible with Chinese.
    Various languages that adopt Latin letters, such as English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian, all have their own set of letter names. It can be said that any phonetic alphabet has a name other than its pronunciation, unless it is a syllabic alphabet like Japanese "kana"; syllabic alphabets contain vowels, so there is naturally no need to define another name. It is absolutely necessary for us to define a set of letter names suitable for our needs for the Chinese phonetic alphabet, so that it is easy to teach and say. The set of letter names we have now defined is relatively close to the original names of Latin letters. (To be continued)

    汉语拼音方案草案问答

    5、汉语拼音字母有几种体式？
    拉丁字母有大楷、小楷、大草和小草四种体式。汉语拼音字母也是沿用这四种体式。先说楷书，即印刷体：A，B，C……是大楷，a，b，c……是小楷。二十六个字母中，有八个字母的大楷和小楷在字形上完全相同：Cc、Oo、Pp、Ss、Vv、Ww、Xx、Zz；有四个字母基本相同：Kk、Mm、Uu、Yy；有六个字母比较近似，不难辨认：Bb、Hh、Ii、Jj、Nn、Tt；其余的八个字母差别较大，甚至全不相同：Aa、Dd、Ee、Ff、Gg、Ll、Qq、Rr。初学拉丁字母的人，可以先学小楷，等二十六个小楷字母全部掌握以后，进而学习其他体式，就比较容易。至于拉丁字母的手写体，即大草和小草，可以依照拉丁字母的一般书写习惯书写。将来应该编印汉语拼音字母的草书范本，供初学拉丁字母的人临摹。
    一个字母有四种体式，在学习上自然要增加一些麻烦。因此，有人主张只采用一种体式，比方采用小楷，而不采用其他三种体式，或者仍保留大楷小楷，但是把一部分在字形上与小楷不同的大楷字母，改变成与小楷一致，以便于学习。这种主张是有理由的。但是拉丁字母的大楷有它们的特殊的用途，而且已经成为全世界通行的习惯。人名、地名的第一个字母要大写，如Lenin（列宁），Roma（罗马）；化学原素的符号要大写：氢气是H，氮气是N。因此，对于一个中学生来说，即使汉语拼音方案不采用大楷字母，他在数学、物理、化学等课本上，还是非学大楷字母不可。我们既然采用拉丁字母，那末承认拉丁字母的这种国际习惯，对于文化科学的交流是有利的。至于学习上的一些麻烦，可以在教学顺序上解决，例如大楷字母初小一二年级可以不教，到三四年级再教，正如现行初小语文课本开头六册用的是正楷字，从第七册起改用宋体字一样。
    6、为什么要规定字母的名称？
    字母表还规定了二十六个汉语拼音字母的名称。字母除了有它的读音之外，还有它的名称（字母表只规定字母的名称，声母表和韵母表只规定字母的读音），正如一个人除了职务之外，还有姓名一样。名称是为了便于称呼，是字母的姓名，读音才是字母在拼音时的实际发音，是字母的职务。例如h这个字母，它的名称是ha（哈），它的读音是h（喝）。以英文为例，c这个字母的名称是“西”，但是它的读音是k（刻）或者是s（思）。
    为什么不拿字母的读音作为名称，使名称跟读音一致呢？拿读音作为名称，免得另定名称，固然省事，但是有很大的缺点：子音字母的读音一般是念不响亮，听不清楚的，称呼起来不方便，距离远一点或者在电话里，不容易听清楚，甚至会听错。用“哈”作h的名称，自然比“喝”的声母响亮。为什么不用注音字母的名称作为拼音字母的名称呢？因为一部分注音字母的名称也不够响亮。而在注音字母中没有相当于yw的字母，这两个字母的名称总得另定。我们自然也不能用英文字母的名称作为我们这套字母的名称，英文字母的名称跟汉语不能适应。
    采用拉丁字母的各种文字，如英文、德文、法文、西班牙文和意大利文等，都有自己的一套字母名称。可以说，任何拼音字母都于读音之外另有名称，除非像日本“假名”那样的音节字母；音节字母里包含母音，自然可以不要另定名称。我们为汉语拼音字母规定一套适合我们需要的名称，以便于教和说是完全必要的。现在我们规定的这套字母名称，跟拉丁字母原来的名称是比较接近的。（未完）
