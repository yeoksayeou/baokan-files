Xinhua News Agency, London, January 7th. On the eve of Prime Minister Macmillan's planned visit to Asian Commonwealth countries, the British cabinet has suddenly been shaken by turmoil. Chancellor of the Exchequer Peter Thorneycroft announced his resignation on the evening of the 6th in protest against the government's fiscal policy. Accompanying Thorneycroft in resigning were Nigel Birch, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, and Enoch Powell, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. Prior to this resignation, the cabinet had held three days of tense meetings.

In his resignation letter, Thorneycroft stated that he was resigning because he was "not prepared to agree to estimates for government current expenditure next year which are greater in total than this year’s." He demanded "restrictions on government spending," believing this to be a "precondition" for "stabilizing the value of the pound, stabilizing prices, and maintaining Britain's prestige and position in the world."

It is revealed that Thorneycroft and others specifically demanded cuts in the government's military budget and social welfare expenditure for the next year. However, Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys, supported by other ministers, firmly disagreed with cutting military spending. Macmillan, considering the upcoming general election, also refused to cut the already meager social welfare expenditure, fearing that the Conservative Party would lose even more popular support.

The position of British Chancellor of the Exchequer has now been assumed by the former Minister of Agriculture, Derek Heathcoat-Amory. In a statement issued on the evening of the 6th, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there would be no change in the government's economic policy. At the same time, the British government also announced that John Hare, the Secretary of State for War, would succeed as Minister of Agriculture; Christopher Soames, the Financial Secretary to the Admiralty, would succeed as Secretary of State for War. Soames is the son-in-law of former Prime Minister Churchill.

    英国当权派的分歧在经济政策上爆发
    财政大臣桑尼克罗夫特辞职
    据新华社伦敦7日电　英国内阁在首相麦克米伦准备前往亚洲英联邦国家访问的前夕突然发生动荡。财政大臣桑尼克罗夫特在6日晚间宣布辞职以抗议政府的财政政策，随同桑尼克罗夫特一起辞职的还有财政部经济次官奈吉尔·伯奇和财政部财务次官埃诺克·鲍威尔。在这次辞职事件爆发以前，内阁曾经举行了三天紧张的会议。
    桑尼克罗夫特在他的辞职书里说：他辞职是因为他“不准备同意明年政府经常开支的估计数字大于今年的总数”。他要求“限制政府开支”，认为这是“稳定英镑价值、稳定物价和维持英国在世界上的威信及地位”的“先决条件”。
    据透露，桑尼克罗夫特等人特别要求削减政府下一年度的军事预算和社会福利开支。但是，国防大臣桑迪斯在其他大臣支持下，坚决不同意削减军事费用；而麦克米伦因为考虑到下届大选，也拒绝削减本来已经微薄的社会福利开支而使保守党更加丧失民心。
    英国财政大臣一职目前已由前农业大臣德里克·希思寇特—埃默里继任。新任财政大臣在6日晚间发表的声明里说，政府经济政策不会有任何改变。同时，英国政府还宣布由陆军大臣约翰·黑尔继任农业大臣；海军部财务次官斯托弗·索姆斯继任陆军大臣，索姆斯是前首相丘吉尔的女婿。
