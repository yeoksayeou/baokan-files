Our Road Has No End
Editor

    The National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) has set goals for agricultural production in various regions, greatly inspiring farmers across the country. But what should those regions that have achieved the program's targets ahead of schedule do next?

    The development of things is endless, and the movement forward never stops. When old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions arise; when old tasks are completed, new tasks are placed on the agenda with the emergence of new contradictions. One of the important responsibilities of leaders is to proactively grasp the laws of the movement of things, and constantly put forward new tasks and new goals to the broad masses based on new situations, new foundations, and new conditions, so that the cause of revolution and construction can continue to advance and constantly achieve new successes.

    The same is true for leading agricultural production. When the production increase target has not yet been reached, the leader's task is, of course, to concentrate efforts to lead the masses to achieve this target. When the original target has been reached and exceeded, attention must be paid to solving new problems that arise among the masses, exploring and studying the conditions and possibilities for further improving the target, and putting forward new targets and steps for realization to the broad masses, and actively mobilizing and organizing the broad masses to fight for the achievement of new targets.

    In Anguo County, during last year's autumn harvest, 50% of agricultural cooperatives and 57% of member households exceeded the income level of local well-to-do middle peasants, and the per-mu yield of both grain and cotton exceeded the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program. In the eyes of Communists and Marxists, this is a major achievement and development on the one hand, and on the other hand, it creates a favorable foundation and conditions for further development. However, many grassroots cadres and masses only saw the former aspect and did not see the latter aspect, so some bad phenomena appeared: they were satisfied with the production level and income level already achieved, and were not interested in increasing accumulation and expanding reproduction (the so-called "it's useless to deduct too much"), extravagance and waste, showing off, and acting lavishly. If this tendency is not reversed, they will stop moving forward and remain at the current production and living standards, which are not very high, when they need to continue to move forward by leaps and bounds. The Anguo County Party Committee promptly discovered these problems, studied the new changes and new situations, and immediately pointed out the direction of continued progress to the county's farmers and cadres based on the local new foundation and conditions, guiding the masses to fight for greater increases in grain and cotton production and a better life. After doing so, the situation quickly changed: the proportion of accumulation increased, the enthusiasm for investing in expanding production increased, and the broad masses became involved in a series of production increase activities such as leveling land, adding livestock, replacing inferior seeds with superior seeds, and building more machine wells, and with unparalleled heroic spirit, they used hoes to deeply dig more than 150,000 mu of cultivated land by more than a foot. The entire countryside has become active again, and people are moving forward by leaps and bounds again.

    From this, we can see that the Anguo County Party Committee is a true promoter. They always look ahead, closely watch the trend of the development of things, and guide people to move forward again and again. It would be very dangerous to be satisfied and stop moving forward after taking a leap forward. Not advancing is retreating, and the result of stopping is bound to be lagging behind. Many agricultural cooperatives in various provinces and regions have already achieved the production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. We hope that widespread attention will be paid to how to guide these agricultural cooperatives to continue to move forward.

    我们的道路没有止境
    编者
    全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）给各个地区的农业生产提出了奋斗的目标，大大地鼓舞了全国农民。但是，那些提前达到了纲要指标的地区下一步应当怎样办呢？
    事物的发展是没有止境的，前进的运动是永远不会停息的。旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又发生；旧的任务完成了，新的任务就会随着新的矛盾的出现而提到议程上来。领导者的重要责任之一就是主动地掌握事物运动的规律，经常根据新的形势，新的基础和新的条件，向广大群众提出新的任务，新的奋斗目标，使革命和建设的事业不断地前进，不断地取得新的成就。
    领导农业生产也是一样。当增产指标还未达到的时候，领导者的任务当然是集中力量领导群众来达到这个指标。而在原定指标已经达到并且超过的时候，就必须注意和解决在群众中发生的新问题，探讨和研究进一步提高指标的条件和可能性，向广大群众提出新的指标和实现的步骤，积极地发动和组织广大群众为达到新的指标而斗争。
    安国县去年秋收决分有50％的农业合作社和57％的社员户超过了当地富裕中农的收入水平，全县粮食和棉花的亩产量都超过了农业发展纲要所提的指标。在共产党人和马克思主义者看来，这一方面是个重大的成就和发展，一方面也是为更进一步的发展创造了有利的基础和条件。但有许多基层的干部和群众只是看到了前一方面，没有看到后一方面，因此就出现了一些不好的现象：满足于已经达到的生产水平和收入水平，对增加积累和扩大再生产不感兴趣（所谓“扣多了也没用处”），铺张浪费，讲排场，讲阔绰。这种倾向如不扭转，他们就会在需要继续大踏步向前迈进的时候反而裹足不前，停止在当前还并不算很高的生产和生活水平上。安国县委及时地发现了这些问题，研究了新的变化、新的形势，立即根据当地新的基础和条件，向全县农民和干部指出继续前进的方向，引导群众为更多地增产粮棉和更美好的生活而斗争。这样做了之后，情势很快就发生了变化：积累的比例提高了，投资扩大生产的热情提高了，广大群众卷入了平整土地、增添牲畜、以优种代替劣种、增筑机井等一系列的增产活动之中，并且以无比的英雄气概，用镐头把十五万亩耕地深掘了一尺多。整个农村又活跃起来了，人们又大踏步地向前走去。
    从这里我们可以看到，安国县委是真正的促进派。他们总是眼睛望着前方，密切注视着事物运动发展的趋势，引导人们前进再前进。如果跃进了一步之后就心满意足，停步不前，那就很危险。不进则退，停步的结果必然是落后。各省区都有许许多多的农业社已经提前实现了农业发展纲要规定的增产指标，对这类农业社，如何引导他们继续前进，希望引起普遍的注意。
