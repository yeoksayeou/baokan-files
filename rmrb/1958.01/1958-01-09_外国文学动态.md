Foreign Literature Trends

Vietnamese Writers Reap a Bumper Harvest During Creative Vacation

The Vietnamese Labor Party and the Vietnamese government, in order to promote Vietnam's literary and artistic creation, stipulated a system last year to grant institutional literary and artistic workers three months of creative vacation each year. The implementation of this system has already yielded good results. The first group of more than one hundred writers and artists who went to the countryside, factories, and troops have created many new works.

Writer To Hoai completed the novel "Ten Years," which depicts the revolutionary activities of young people in the suburbs of Hanoi before the August Revolution, during his creative vacation. Writer Bui Hien wrote three short stories on the theme of the war of resistance. Female writer Anh Tho completed part of a novel about the transformation of a woman. Poet Te Hanh's "To China" and poet Le Dai Thanh's "Haiphong in the Early Days of the War of Resistance," as well as poet Tran Huu Thung's epic poem praising the peasant heroes in the Can Vuong movement (the anti-French struggle in the late 19th century), are all harvests from this creative vacation.

According to the Vietnamese Writers Association, the second group of writers will depart for various places soon. Encouraged by the Party, Vietnamese writers are highly enthusiastic about creation, and the Creative Committee of the Writers Association has received creation outlines of 250 works from more than 170 writers. Most of them are novels, poems, and plays reflecting the War of Resistance against France, the struggle for unification, peaceful construction, and the lives of the working people; in addition, there are literary theory and criticism.

Malayan Writers Propose Developing National Literature

Since Malaya declared independence, the issue of developing Malayan national literature has aroused widespread interest in Malayan public opinion.

In the magazine "Eastern World," Malayan female writer Ham Suin published an article on this issue. She said that the authors of Malayan works are mainly British "immigrants." The number of such literary works is considerable, but Malayans are not interested in them because most of these works are not written for Malayans. She divides the literary works published in Malaya in the past eleven or twelve years into two categories: one category is immigrants writing about immigrants, and the content of these works is not original, but is written to satisfy those "Asian" literature "experts" in London, and Malayans are not interested in these works; the other category is Malayans writing about Malayans, and they use vernacular expressions to reflect local scenery and customs.

Among the writers who write the latter category of works are Kim Ki-o, the author of "Malaye," Patrick Anderson, the author of "Snake Wine," and Meryl Mark-Minnis, the author of "Flying Fox," (Ham Suin is also one of the writers who create Malayan national literature).

Ham Suin said in the article that Patrick Anderson and Meryl Mark-Minnis are both "immigrants," but in their works, one cannot see the cynical tone commonly used by general "immigrants," and they understand the people they describe. Although their two books are not recognized by the British publishing industry, Malayan readers give them high evaluations.

Will Malaya's national literature develop? This is a question that has never been discussed. Ham Suin believes that the proposal of this question now "is a good omen."

    外国文学动态
    越南作家在创作假期中获得丰收
    越南劳动党和越南政府为了繁荣越南的文艺创作，从去年起，规定了给予机关文艺工作者每年三个月创作假期的制度。这一制度的执行已经收到了好效果。第一批到农村、工厂和部队去的一百多位作家和艺术家，他们创作了许多新作品。
    作家苏怀在创作假期中，完成了描写八月革命前河内郊区青年革命活动的长篇小说“十年”；作家裴显写了三篇以抗战为题材的短篇小说；女作家英诗完成了关于描写一个妇女转变的长篇小说的一部分。诗人济亨的“到中国”和诗人黎大清的“抗战初期的海防”，以及诗人陈友椿的歌颂勤王运动（十九世纪末的抗法斗争）中农民英雄的长诗，都是这次创作假期中的收获。
    据越南作家协会透露，第二批作家将即出发到各地去。在党的鼓励下，越南作家的创作热情很高，作家协会创作委员会已经收到一百七十多位作家的二百五十篇作品的创作提纲。其中大部分是以反映抗法战争、统一斗争、和平建设和劳动人民生活等为题材的小说、诗歌、剧本；另外还有文艺理论和批评。
    马来亚作家提出发展民族文学
    马来亚宣布独立以后，有关发展马来亚民族文学的问题已在马来亚舆论界引起了广泛的兴趣。
    在“东方世界”杂志上，马来亚女作家哈姆·苏茵就这个问题发表了文章。她说马来亚的作品的作者，主要是英国的“移民”。这种文学作品的数量相当可观，但马来亚人对它们并不感兴趣，因为这些作品大多不是为马来亚人写的。她将十一、二年来马来亚出版的文学作品分为两类：一类是移民写移民的，这类作品的内容并不是独出心裁的，不过是为了满足伦敦的那些“亚洲”文学“专家”们而写的，马来亚人对这些作品不感兴趣；一类是马来亚人写的关于马来亚人的作品，它们运用方言的表现方法，反映了地方的景色和习俗。
    写后一类作品的作家中，有“马拉耶”的作者金基欧，“蛇酒”的作者帕特里克·安德逊，“飞狐”的作者梅里·马克—敏尼斯，（哈姆·苏茵也是创作马来亚民族文学的作家之一）。
    哈姆·苏茵在文章中说，帕·安德逊和梅里·马克—敏尼斯都是“移民”，但在他们的作品里，看不到一般“移民”所惯用的那种讥讽口吻，他们了解他们所描写的人。他们的两本书虽然得不到英国出版界的承认，而马来亚读者却给它们很高的评价。
    马来亚的民族文学会不会有发展？这是个从未讨论过的问题。哈姆·苏茵认为，现在这问题的提出“就是一个良好的先兆”。
