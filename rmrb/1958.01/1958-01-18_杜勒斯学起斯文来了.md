Dulles Starts to Act Civilized
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

On January 16th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a pre-publicized "important foreign policy speech." There are some noteworthy points in this speech.

Dulles admitted that the Soviet Union's artificial satellite "may mark" a "decisive turning point in the world-scale struggle" between East and West, and that the socialist camp "has undoubtedly gained a victory." He also acknowledged—albeit indirectly—the strong development of the socialist camp, its industrial growth, and the expansion of its international influence. He also stated: "Further negotiations should and will be held with the Soviet Union." He even said that abandoning the method of negotiation is "utterly stupid," as if he had never said such stupid things as "negotiations with the Soviet Union are meaningless."

Of course, it is no accident that Dulles uttered these words, which are completely uncharacteristic of him. In one part of his speech, Dulles said: "If we act like a bull in a bullring, blindly charging at the bullfighter's red cape, then we may face destruction." This sentence reveals something of Dulles's helpless state of mind. A quick glance at some recent Western newspapers and magazines, including those in the United States, will reveal sharp criticisms, or rather, attacks, on the current U.S. Secretary of State's die-hard diplomacy. Calls for Dulles to step down are growing louder, forcing Eisenhower to personally come out to support him. It seems that after Dulles ran into brick walls, he finally learned a little bit of sense, realizing that reckless actions alone are not enough and that he must learn to be a little more civilized.

It is certainly not a bad thing that Dulles has finally acknowledged these well-known facts. And if he has indeed learned a lesson, it can even be considered a good thing. However, it is too early to believe that Dulles has become clear-headed.

There is no need to mention the old anti-Soviet and anti-communist clichés in his speech. Even the "sincerity" of the United States' willingness to negotiate, which he tried to strongly impress upon people, must be questioned. Although he admitted that "there is room for negotiation," he tried his best to make people believe that negotiations with socialist countries are difficult and full of dangers. Although he said that the United States is "willing" to hold summit meetings, he put forward many conditions for such meetings that are obviously unacceptable and urged people not to believe that such meetings could have a beneficial impact on the situation.

A careful reading of Dulles's speech makes it clear that his basic tone has not changed, which is to use the pretext of the unfounded "communist aggression threat" to advocate for arms expansion and war preparation, coupled with the so-called "economic warfare," that is, using "aid" and "reciprocal trade" to infiltrate and control the vast intermediate zone countries, especially the economically backward countries.

In fact, Dulles's speech is a new propaganda strategy. Its purpose, on the one hand, is to use the Soviet Union's scientific achievements to stir up an abnormal national sentiment among Americans, driving them to be "more willing to make sacrifices"; on the other hand, it is to use some conciliatory tones to resist the surging international tide that demands that the U.S. government change its policy and hold summit talks with the Soviet Union to promote peace, attempting to shift the pressure of public opinion onto the Soviet Union.

Dulles seems to think that as long as he talks a lot, even slapping himself in the face a few times, people will not see clearly the true source of the current international tension and the fact that the U.S. government is still extremely unwilling to hold high-level East-West talks. This is rather naive. The main point that Dulles's speech shows to people is that the U.S. government is very afraid that high-level talks will improve the situation, but the pressure to demand talks to ease the situation has become so strong that it has to appear more civilized.

A bull acting civilized does not mean it is no longer a bull. The conclusion that should be drawn from this change in Dulles is that the current situation is definitely favorable to peace, but peace will not come automatically. Only by the peace-loving forces persisting in the struggle can the imperialist forces of war be forced to accept peaceful coexistence.

    杜勒斯学起斯文来了
    本报评论员
    美国国务卿杜勒斯16日发表了一篇事先宣传了的“重要的外交政策演说”。在这篇演说中有一些值得注意之点。
    杜勒斯承认了，苏联的人造卫星上天“可能标志着”东西方之间的“世界规模斗争的一个决定性的转折点”，社会主义阵营“无疑是得到了一个胜利”。他还承认了——虽然是转弯抹角地——社会主义阵营的强大发展，它的工业的增长和国际影响的扩大。他还表示：“应该而且也将要和苏联进一步举行谈判。”他甚至说放弃谈判方法是“愚蠢透顶”的，好像他从来没有讲过诸如“同苏联谈判是毫无意义的”之类的蠢话。
    当然，从杜勒斯嘴里，讲出这几句对于他来说是完全不习惯的言语来，绝不是偶然的。杜勒斯在演说的一个地方说：“如果我们做起事来像斗牛场中的一头低下头去盲目冲向斗牛士的红斗篷的蛮牛一样，那末我们就可能要遭到毁灭。”这句话倒是多少吐露了一点杜勒斯无可奈何的心境。随便翻开近来西方国家包括美国在内的一些报刊杂志，都会看到关于美国现任国务卿的死硬外交的尖锐评论，或者说得更确切些是抨击。要求杜勒斯下台的呼声，越来越大，逼得艾森豪威尔不得不亲自出马来替他撑腰。看来，在杜勒斯碰得头破角折之后，终于学了一点乖，就是一味蛮干是不行了，必须要学得斯文一点。
    杜勒斯终于承认了这些众所周知的事实，总不是一件坏事。而且如果确是吸取了教训，还算得是一件好事。但是要相信杜勒斯已经变得头脑清醒起来，那还太早。
    关于他演说里的那老一套反苏反共滥调不必说了。甚至是他想着重地给人留下印象的那美国愿意谈判的“诚意”，也得加一个大问号。他虽然承认“谈判的余地是有的”，但他在阐述这个命题时却竭力要使人相信，同社会主义国家谈判是困难而且充满危险的。他虽然说美国是“愿意”举行最高级会议的，但他又为这种会议提出了许多显然是不能接受的条件，而且要人们不要相信这种会议对时局能产生有利的影响。
    仔细一读杜勒斯的演说，就不难看出，他的基本的调子并没有变，就是借口莫须有的“共产主义侵略威胁”来鼓吹扩军备战，加上所谓“经济战”，即利用“援助”和“互惠贸易”来渗入和控制广大中间地带的国家，特别是经济落后的国家。
    实际上，杜勒斯的演说是一种新的宣传策略。其目的，一方面是利用苏联在科学上的成就，企图在美国人中间煽起一种反常的民族情绪，驱使他们“更加愿意作出牺牲”；另一方面则是用一些和解的语调来抵挡国际上要求美国政府改变政策，同苏联举行最高级会谈来促进和平的汹涌的浪潮，企图把舆论压力转嫁到苏联头上。
    杜勒斯似乎以为，只要他费些唇舌，甚至打自己两下嘴巴，人们就会看不清楚目前造成国际紧张局势的真正根源和美国政府仍然极不愿意举行东西方高级会谈的事实。这未免想得太天真了。杜勒斯的演说向人们表明的主要一点倒是，美国政府非常害怕高级会谈会使得局势得到改善，但是要求会谈缓和局势的压力已经这样强大，以至于它不得不表现得斯文一些。
    蛮牛装斯文，不等于已经不是蛮牛了。从杜勒斯的这一点变化应当得出来的结论是：目前的形势确定地有利于和平，但是和平不会自动到来。只有爱好和平的力量坚持斗争，才能够迫使帝国主义战争势力接受和平共处。
