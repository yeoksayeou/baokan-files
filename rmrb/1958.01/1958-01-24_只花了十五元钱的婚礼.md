    On the evening of the 21st, the club in Xinghua Township, Hong'an County, Hubei Province, was very lively. A young couple from the Jiansu Agricultural Cooperative was holding their wedding there.

    When the reporter arrived at the venue, it was already packed with people. A young couple sat in the middle of the crowd. The groom, Ge Xujin, is the secretary of the Communist Youth League Xinghua Township General Branch, and the bride, Geng Dongju, is a well-known good girl in the township and a production expert, now sitting shyly with her head down. People of all ages, men and women, came to offer congratulations, from this village and other villages; there were also cadres working in the township, and the head of the county party committee's rural work department also came. A portrait of Chairman Mao hung in the center of the venue, simple and unadorned. The guests were treated only with a few candies, cigarettes, and home-fried peanuts. In the past, when weddings were held here, the bride would be carried in a sedan chair with musical accompaniment, and the groom's family would hold a three-day banquet, but this young couple's wedding was so simple that everyone felt it was something new. Fang Sixin, a guest around forty years old, said: "It's great to hold weddings like this, saving money and being lively at the same time." Someone next to him immediately added: "This kind of wedding saves at least two hundred yuan compared to the old-style weddings." Some young couples who were preparing to get married immediately liked this lively scene even more. Communist Youth League members Wang Jixiang and Cai Chunxiang, an engaged couple, expressed on the spot that when they get married in the future, they must follow this method.

    The wedding proceeded amidst bursts of applause and laughter. When it was the groom and bride's turn to speak, they assured the guests that they would work harder this year in the great leap forward in agricultural production and do a good job in work and production. The bride also specifically proposed that in the future, she would learn to manage the household, be diligent and thrifty, and make the whole family live comfortably. Finally, she sang a wonderful local opera excerpt for everyone.

    The reporter followed everyone and sent the newlyweds into their bridal chamber. Two candles illuminated the bridal chamber brightly. The bridal chamber was very simple. The red wooden bed was painted by the groom himself the day before, using earth red he bought for one jiao. The pictures on the bed frame, such as "Phoenixes Stringing Peonies" and "Magpies Catching Plums," were also painted by the groom overnight. The table by the door was the dowry of Ge Xujin's mother thirty years ago, and it is still very good after being painted with earth red. Looking around, there was no sign of the bride's dowry. Upon inquiring, it was learned that the bride only brought a few personal belongings when she came over. The reporter quietly asked Ge Xujin's mother: "Isn't it too simple?" The old lady immediately replied: "It's always yourself who suffers when you put on airs for a wedding." It turned out that she was someone who had suffered from this: thirty years ago, when she married Ge Xujin's father, in order to save face and for the sake of social relations, they held a big feast for three days, with banquets from morning till night. The family was already poor, and they had to borrow money from the landlord Qin Bihua to entertain the guests. After the wedding, the debt snowballed, and they had to mortgage their only five mu of land to him. After that, Ge Xujin's father was forced to go up the mountain to chop firewood every day, and his mother sold pancakes and fried dough sticks. Life only improved after liberation. The old lady told the reporter: "If the Communist Party hadn't advocated new-style weddings, I would have had to sell my big fat pig to pay off debts. Now, it only cost fifteen yuan to hold this wedding. Tell me, how happy can one be!"

    只花了十五元钱的婚礼
    新华社记者　田庄
    21日晚上，湖北省红安县杏花乡的俱乐部里非常热闹。这是建苏农业社的一对青年男女在那里举行婚礼。
    记者赶到会场的时候，已经满屋子人。人群中间坐着一对新人。新郎葛绪金是共青团杏花乡总支书记，新娘耿冬菊是全乡有名的好姑娘，生产上的能手，现在正羞答答地低头坐着。前来贺喜的男女老少有本村的，也有外村的；还有在这个乡工作的干部，县委农村工作部长也赶来了。会场中央挂了一张毛主席像，简单、朴素。招待来宾的只有少许糖果、纸烟和自家炒的花生。往常这里办喜事新娘要吹打坐轿，男家要摆三天酒席，而这一对年青人的婚礼却这样简单，大家都感到新鲜。一个四十岁上下的客人方思心说：这样办喜事极好，又省钱又热闹。旁边的另一个人马上接着说：这种婚礼比旧式婚礼起码要节省二百多元。一些准备马上结婚的青年男女看到这个热闹场面，更是喜欢。共青团员王基香和蔡春香是一对未婚夫妻，他们当场就表示将来结婚的时候，也一定要照着这个办法做。
    婚礼是在一阵又一阵的掌声和笑声中进行的。轮到新郎和新娘讲话的时候，他俩向到场的来宾保证今年在农业生产大跃进中一定要加劲干，搞好工作和生产。新娘还特别提出今后要学会过日子，勤俭持家，让全家过得舒坦坦的，最后她还为大家唱了一段精采的地方戏。
    记者随着大家一直把一对新人送入洞房。两支蜡烛把洞房照得亮堂堂的。洞房里非常简单，一张红色木床是新郎前一天花了一角钱买了土红自己漆的，床架上的图画“凤串牡丹”、“鹊雀捉梅”等，也是新郎花了一晚上的工夫，连夜画出来的。靠门口放的那张桌子，是葛绪金母亲三十年前的嫁妆，现在涂上了土红仍旧很好。看来看去，总找不到新娘带来的嫁妆，一打听，新娘只带了几件随身的衣物就过门来了。记者悄悄地问葛绪金的母亲说：“这样简单，你不嫌吗？”这个老大娘马上回答说：“结婚讲排场，吃亏还不是自己？”原来她就是吃过这个苦头的人：三十年前，当她跟葛绪金的父亲结婚的时候，为了人情、面子，大请了三天客，筵席从早上一直摆到晚上，家里本来就穷，要请客只好向地主秦毕华借了一笔钱，婚后债越滚越大，最后只得把仅有的五亩田抵给人家，此后葛绪金的父亲被逼得每天上山打柴，母亲卖饼子油条。直到解放后日子才好过起来。老大娘对记者说：“要不是共产党提倡新式结婚，我喂的一头大肥猪卖了还得借债。现在只花了十五元就把这椿喜事办了。你说叫人多高兴！”
