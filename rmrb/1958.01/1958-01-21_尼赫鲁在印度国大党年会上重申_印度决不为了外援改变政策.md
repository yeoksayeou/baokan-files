Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Xinhua News Agency, Guwahati: The 63rd Annual Meeting of the Indian National Congress concluded on the evening of the 19th.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru spoke at the closing meeting. At the closing meeting, he announced that India would not change its policy of non-alignment in order to obtain foreign aid.

Nehru said that some people still harbor the hope that they can change our policies by providing large amounts of aid or exerting pressure. These people measure us by their psychological standards, and these standards are not applicable to India.

While criticizing those who completely rely on foreign aid, Nehru said that all foreign aid is welcome, but if anyone thinks that India cannot make progress without foreign aid, it will mean our decline and destruction. Nehru said amid cheers: "Even if the National Congress changes its policy in order to obtain foreign aid, the country will not allow it."

The National Congress annual meeting passed a resolution on land reform on the last day of the meeting. Speakers at the meeting emphasized that it is only possible to increase food production by quickly implementing land reform.

The land reform advocated by the National Congress mainly involves obtaining land exceeding the maximum limit owned by landlords through government legislative measures and by giving landlords compensation, and then the government sells these lands to farmers.

Tripathi said: Land reform itself is not the goal; land reform will lead to agricultural collectivization.

In addition to the resolution on land reform, the meeting earlier also passed various resolutions on the Goa issue, economic situation, education construction, language issues, and international issues, as proposed by the proposal committee.

    尼赫鲁在印度国大党年会上重申
    印度决不为了外援改变政策
    本报综合报道　据新华社高哈蒂讯：印度国大党第六十三届年会于19日晚上闭幕。
    印度总理尼赫鲁在闭幕会议上发言。他在闭幕会议上宣布，印度不会为了取得外援而改变它的不参加集团的政策。
    尼赫鲁说，某些人仍然怀着希望，以为用提供大量援助或施加压力的办法就能够使我们改变政策。这种人用他们的心理上的尺度来衡量我们，而这种尺度对印度是不适用的。
    尼赫鲁在批评那些完全信赖外援的人时说，一切外援都是欢迎的，但是如果有人认为，印度没有外援就不可能取得进展，那将意味着我们的衰亡和毁灭。尼赫鲁在欢呼声中说：“即使国大党为了想获得外援而改变政策，国家也不会容许。”
    国大党年会最后一天会议通过了关于土地改革的决议。在会上发言的人们着重地说，只有迅速实行土地改革，才有可能增加粮食生产。
    国大党所主张的土地改革，主要是通过政府的立法措施，用给予地主补偿金的办法，取得地主所有的超过最高限额的土地，然后由政府把这些土地卖给农民。
    特里帕蒂说：土地改革本身并不是目的，土地改革将要导致农业合作化。
    除了关于土地改革的决议以外，会议在早些时候还通过了提案委员会所通过的关于果阿问题、经济情况、教育建设、语言问题和国际问题等各项决议。
