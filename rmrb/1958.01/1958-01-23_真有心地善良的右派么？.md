    Are There Really Rightists With Kind Hearts?
    Hua Hua
    Editor's Note: Currently, a debate is underway in many universities regarding the handling of rightist elements. The purpose of the debate is to further draw ideological lines between ourselves and rightist elements and to raise socialist consciousness. This newspaper will successively excerpt articles from various school newspapers on this topic to share with readers.
    Rightist elements often play dumb and say: "I admit that objectively I am anti-Party and anti-socialist, but my subjective intentions are good." Or they say: "Although the effects of my words and actions are very bad, my motives are kind." These words from the mouths of rightists are not surprising. Because rightist elements want to use this to excuse themselves and attempt to overturn the verdict. However, some of our classmates actually believe the lies of the rightists and also say: "It is certainly not good for rightist elements to be anti-Party and anti-socialist, but their motives may be good, and their subjective intentions may be kind." Therefore, this issue needs to be explored. I ask: Are there really rightists with kind hearts?
    First, let us briefly review the facts of the rightists' attack on us: Under the correct leadership of the Party, our country has made brilliant achievements in socialist construction and socialist revolution. Industrial and agricultural production has developed rapidly, people's lives have generally improved, and everywhere is a thriving new atmosphere. Our universities have also made great achievements in various aspects in recent years. All of this is ironclad fact that is obvious to all, and even a Young Pioneer who has just started school knows it very well. However, rightist elements completely deny all of this, slandering our new society as "too dark," the Communist Party as "too bad" and "about to collapse," and our universities as "a complete mess," "the Party committee is ignorant and incompetent," and so on. Can it be said that they are kind-hearted?
    If they were kind-hearted and wanted to help the Party, then why did they use vile and malicious words such as "big bureaucrats," "heartless people," "destroying the lives of young people," and "maggots" to scold the Party? Why did they rack their brains to exaggerate facts out of thin air and fabricate many rumors to slander the Party and socialism? Why did they instigate trouble everywhere, and try every possible means to attack the Party committee, to "drive the Party out of the school," and even shout wildly: "We want to kill Communist Party members"? Is there such a peculiar logic in the world: to curse you, to cut off your head, is still kind-hearted, still helping you?
    Kind-hearted rightists, not only can we not find them in our school, but I think we cannot find them anywhere in the world. The reason why rightist elements used to flaunt that their motives were also "to help the Party rectify its style" was only because the Party has a very high prestige among the people of the whole country, so they used helping the Party rectify its style as a guise to win over people, confuse the public, and deceive the masses. Their true intention was to bring down the Party and bring down socialism. Let us look at the self-introduction of the rightist elements: Wu Xuehua, a rightist element in the political teaching and research group, said: "Deep down in my thoughts, I hate this new society and want to return to the old society"... "When I wake up in the middle of the night, I hate it to the bone, wishing I could kill people, or set the school on fire." Look! This is the "good" heart of the rightist elements, this is the true portrayal of their "kind hearts."
    If it were not for our wise Party Central Committee promptly seeing through the conspiracies and tricks of the rightists and leading us to smash their criminal activities, if the "good" wishes of the rightists had been realized, our country today would not know what kind of tragic situation it would have been turned into by the enemy, and our heads might not be on our necks, but rather lying under the butcher knives of Ge Peiqi, Huang Shaohong, and the like. Rightist elements are frantically anti-Party and anti-socialist, and some of our comrades still cannot hate them, and still say that the motives of the rightist elements may be good, and their subjective intentions are "kind." These comrades really see the problem too simply and see the rightists as too "kind." However, in class struggle, we must never use "the heart of a gentleman to measure the belly of a villain," and it is wrong to regard political problems that belong to the contradiction between ourselves and the enemy as ideological problems that belong to the contradiction among the people. We must never regard "enemies" as "friends," and we must know that "kindness" to the enemy is cruelty to the people. In class struggle, we must thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois ideology in our minds, we must firmly stand on the working-class stand, and we must use the method of class analysis to analyze and handle all problems. Otherwise, we will not be able to see the essence of the problem, and we may even be deceived by the enemy.

### 真有心地善良的右派么？

    真有心地善良的右派么？
    化花
    编者按：目前，在许多高等学校中，正在进行一场关于处理右派分子问题的辩论。辩论的目的是为了进一步在思想上划清同右派分子的界限，提高社会主义觉悟。本报将陆续从各校校刊上摘发一些关于这方面的文章，以飨读者。
    右派分子经常装糊涂说：“我承认客观上是反党、反社会主义，但我的主观意图是好的。”或是说：“我的言行效果虽然很坏，但我的动机是善良的。”这些话出自右派之口，是不足为奇的。因为右派分子想借此为自己开罪，企图翻案。但是，我们有些同学竟轻信了右派的谎言，也说：“右派分子固然反党、反社会主义不好，但是动机可能是好的，主观意图可能是善良的。”因此，这个问题就有探讨的必要了。试问：真有心地善良的右派吗？
    首先，我们还是简单回顾一下右派向我们进攻的事实吧：我们国家在党的正确领导下，在社会主义建设和社会主义革命方面都取得了辉煌的成绩，工农业生产飞速发展，人民生活普遍提高，到处都是欣欣向荣的新气象。我们的高等学校几年来也在各方面取得了巨大的成就。这一切都是有目共睹的铁的事实，甚至一个刚上学的少先队员都知道得很清楚。然而，右派分子却全盘否定这一切，污蔑我们新社会“太黑暗了”，共产党“太坏了”“要垮台了”，污蔑我们高等学校是“一团黑”“党委不学无术”等等。难道这能说他们心地善良吗？
    假如他们是心地善良，是为了帮助党，那么，他们为什么要用“大官僚”“没良心的人”“摧残青年生命”“蛆虫”等等下流恶毒的字眼来谩骂党呢？他们为什么要挖空心思地无中生有夸大事实，并捏造了许多谣言来污蔑党和社会主义呢？他们为什么到处煽动点火，千方百计地来攻击党委会，要把党“赶出学校”，甚至狂叫：“要杀共产党员”呢？难道天下竟有这样奇特的逻辑：毒骂你，要砍你的头，还是心地善良，还是在帮助你？
    心地善良的右派，不仅我们学校找不到，我看走遍天下也找不到。右派分子过去所以标榜他们的动机也是“为了帮助党整风”，那只是因为党在全国人民中威信很高，他们就以帮助党整风为幌子，来笼络人心，混淆视听，欺骗群众。他们的真心实意就是要搞垮党，搞垮社会主义。我们看看右派分子的自我介绍吧：政治教研组右派分子吴雪华说：“思想深处就讨厌这个新社会，想回到旧社会去”“……睡觉半夜想起来，都会恨之入骨，恨不得把人杀了，或者放一把火把学校烧了。”请看！这就是右派分子们的“好”心肠，这就是他们“心地善良”的真实写照。
    要不是我们英明的党中央及时看穿了右派的阴谋诡计，领导我们粉碎了他们的罪恶活动，如果让右派的“好”愿望实现的话，我们的国家今天不知道被敌人闹成什么样的悲惨局面，我们这些人的头颅可能不是长在我们的颈子上，而是倒在葛佩琦、黄绍竑之流的屠刀之下了。右派分子猖狂反党、反社会主义，我们有些同志还恨不起来，还说右派分子的动机可能是好的，主观意图可能是“善良”的。这些同志确实把问题看得太简单了，把右派看得太“善良”了。但是，在阶级斗争中，决不能用“君子之心去度小人之腹”，把属于敌我矛盾的政治问题，看作属于人民内部矛盾的思想方法问题，是错误的。我们决不能把“敌人”当成“朋友”，须知对敌人的“善良”就是对人民的残忍。在阶级斗争中，必须彻底清除自己头脑中的资产阶级思想，必须站稳工人阶级立场，必须用阶级分析的方法来分析和处理一切问题。否则，就看不清问题的本质，甚至会被敌人所蒙蔽。
