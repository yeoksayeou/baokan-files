The Ministry of Higher Education recently issued "Instructions on Resolutely Implementing the Policy of Building the Country and Running Schools Through Diligence and Thrift." The instructions stated that since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council put forward the policy of building the country and running schools through diligence and thrift and launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy, all universities and colleges, under the leadership of their respective competent departments and local Party and government leaders, have generally carried out ideological mobilization for streamlining and economizing, and have taken some measures to achieve initial results. Later, due to the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, it was temporarily suspended. At present, the schools have successively entered the rectification and reform stage, and many schools have launched a rectification and reform upsurge. Our ministry believes that, in conjunction with socialist ideological education, fully mobilizing the masses, vigorously exposing and criticizing extravagance and waste, and resolutely and earnestly implementing the policy of "building the country and running schools through diligence and thrift" should be regarded as an important political task in the rectification and reform work. At present, some schools have achieved remarkable results in opposing extravagance and waste and raising the socialist consciousness of teachers, students, and staff because the leadership has grasped this link and fully mobilized the masses.
    According to the results of recent inspections of some schools in cooperation with relevant departments, and the preliminary revelations of some schools in the rectification and reform stage, measured by the requirements of "building the country and running schools through diligence and thrift," there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work, and extravagance and waste are still very common, and some are very serious. The main manifestations are: in terms of staffing, the phenomena of large institutions, multiple levels, uneven workload, and overstaffing are relatively common. In terms of capital construction, the planning and layout of school buildings are overly ambitious and emphasize novelty, failing to start from China's current economic level, blindly pursuing modernization, paying attention to ostentation and grandeur, and design standards are too high. As a result, state funds are wasted. In terms of land acquisition, due to the excessively high original land-use standards, coupled with the fact that some newly built or relocated schools did not implement the land-use quota and land acquisition regulations; or due to sparse building density and scattered construction land, the phenomenon of land waste is also quite serious. In terms of instruments and books, due to lax management, unclear inventory, each laboratory and department emphasized exclusive use, and did not share resources; instruments were purchased before scientific research topics were determined; and there was a blind pursuit of newness, size, quantity, and sophistication; thus, wrong purchases, repeated purchases, excessive purchases, and random purchases occurred, resulting in stockpiles. Due to the lack of necessary systems, arbitrary damage, loss, and even theft also occur from time to time, causing great waste. In terms of general student scholarships and employee welfare, the scope of enjoyment of general student scholarships and food standards have not been adjusted in a timely manner according to the new situation, and are generally too broad and too high, and those who should not enjoy them also enjoy them. Many schools charge too low rent, water and electricity fees, and furniture fees for employee dormitories, and do not implement the standards of local state organs; and the public subsidies are excessive. Some family daily life problems that should and could be solved by individuals are often required to be solved with the assistance of the public.
    In short, at present, universities and colleges have not earnestly implemented the policy of running schools through diligence and thrift, and the style of hard work, diligence, and thrift is still very poor. This not only wastes the state's manpower, material resources, and financial resources, but also fosters the dependent thinking of teachers, students, and staff that all difficulties rely on the public for solution. It also easily cultivates the bad tendencies of pursuing comfort, fearing a hard life, unwilling to go to the countryside, factories, or laboratories, looking down on physical labor, looking down on the working masses, looking down on laboratory work, and neglecting the integration of theory with practice. Therefore, implementing the policy of "running schools through diligence and thrift" is not only to save the state's manpower, material resources, and construction funds to accelerate China's socialist construction, but also directly related to what kind of talents we want to cultivate and in what environment we want to cultivate them, that is, how to correctly implement the socialist education policy. This belongs to the issue of two different education lines of socialist education and bourgeois education, which deserves our serious attention.
    The instructions stated that in order to combine rectification and reform with the socialist ideological education movement, and earnestly implement the policy of building the country and running schools through diligence and thrift, it is hoped that all schools will earnestly study and implement the following tasks in light of their specific circumstances:
    1. Vigorously streamline institutions and staffing. The current situation of complex, overlapping, and overstaffed institutions in universities and colleges must be changed. All schools should strengthen labor discipline, improve work efficiency, and resolutely reduce institutions and staffing. And resolutely implement the central government's instructions on organizing and mobilizing a large number of cadres, especially young intellectual cadres, to participate in physical labor, and organize all faculty and staff in a planned manner and in batches to participate in the necessary physical labor exercises. Surplus personnel should be properly handled according to different situations, such as retirement, resignation, participation in grassroots work, or participation in labor production.
    2. Adjust student scholarship standards. The management and use of general student scholarships must implement the class line and mainly solve the difficulties of poor workers and peasants. Establish a strict approval system to prevent unreasonable and wasteful phenomena from occurring. Student scholarship standards should be close to the living standards of the local working people.
    3. Dispose of surplus land and save on capital construction investment. All schools should inspect the situation of occupied land and try to correct the phenomenon of land waste. All green spaces, sports fields, construction land, and experimental and practice sites that are too large should be resolutely reduced. If the building density does not meet the prescribed standards and there is too much open space, measures should be taken to fill in the gaps and use them. After reorganization, all land that is not needed for capital construction in 1958 should be handed over to farmers for cultivation, and should be disposed of before the winter of 1957. At the same time, the utilization rate of existing school buildings should also be improved. The living standards of faculty and staff dormitories should also be in accordance with the standards stipulated by the state. All living standards that are too high should be reasonably adjusted. All existing school buildings that can be adjusted to solve the housing problem will no longer be expanded to build auditoriums, gymnasiums, administrative rooms, etc.
    4. Thoroughly clear up teaching equipment and earnestly dispose of stockpiled materials. All schools should conduct a comprehensive and thorough inventory of existing machines, instruments, equipment, experimental materials, and library collections, establish sound property accounts, and seriously and earnestly dispose of stockpiled materials. In addition, it is also necessary to save on recurring expenses, and the standards for various financial expenditures should be appropriately reduced, especially the expenditure of administrative expenses.
    The instructions stated that whether the policy of running schools through diligence and thrift can be implemented and whether it can be adhered to for a long time depends on the leadership. Therefore, the leadership of each school should regard this work as one of the central tasks of the rectification and reform stage and as one of their regular and important tasks, and take all necessary forms to conduct ideological education work for all teachers, students, and staff in a planned manner, fully mobilize the masses, especially requiring the mobilization of teaching staff, boldly expose any extravagant and wasteful phenomena, launch criticism and self-criticism, and improve everyone's socialist ideological consciousness. Criticize individualism, departmentalism, and all phenomena of extravagance and waste and not cherishing public property, establish the atmosphere of saving being honorable and waste being shameful, and promote the revolutionary tradition of hard work, so as to correctly implement the socialist education policy and more effectively promote the steady progress of China's higher education construction cause.

### 高等教育部指示全国高等学校  切实贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办学的方针

    高等教育部指示全国高等学校
    切实贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办学的方针
    本报讯　高等教育部最近发出“关于切实贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办学方针的指示”。指示说，自中共中央和国务院提出勤俭建国、勤俭办学的方针和开展增产节约运动的号召以后，各高等学校在各主管部门和当地党政领导下，一般的都进行了精简节约的思想动员，采取了一些措施，获得了初步成绩。后因全国转入整风和反右派斗争，而暂时停顿下来。目前各校已经陆续进入整改阶段，许多学校已经掀起了整改热潮。我部认为：结合社会主义思想教育，充分发动群众，大力揭发和批判铺张浪费现象，坚决地、切实地贯彻“勤俭建国、勤俭办学”方针，应该作为整改工作中的一项重要政治任务。目前有的学校由于领导上抓紧了这个环节，充分发动了群众，在反对铺张浪费、提高师生员工的社会主义觉悟方面已经有了显著的成效。
    根据最近配合各有关部门对部分学校进行了检查的结果，和最近有些学校在整改阶段初步揭发的情况看，从“勤俭建国、勤俭办学”的要求来衡量，我们工作中存在的缺点和错误还很多，铺张浪费现象还很普遍，有些且很严重。主要表现在：在人员编制方面，机构大、层次多、忙闲不均、人浮于事的现象比较普遍。在基本建设方面，对校舍建筑的规划布局贪大、贪新，没有从我国当前的经济水平出发，盲目追求现代化、讲究排场、气派、设计标准过高。因而，浪费了国家的资金。在征用土地方面，由于原订用地标准偏高，加上有些新建或迁建学校，没有按用地定额和征用土地的规定执行；或是由于建筑密度稀，施工用地分散等原因，浪费土地的现象也相当严重。在仪器图书等方面，由于管理不严，家底不清，各实验室之间，各系之间强调专用，互不通有无；科学研究题目未定，就先购置仪器；盲目地追求新、大、多、精；因而发生错购、重购、多购、乱购，造成积压。由于缺乏必要的制度，任意损坏、丢失，甚至被盗窃等现象也时常发生，造成很大的浪费。在一般学生人民助学金和职工福利方面，由于对一般学生人民助学金的享受面和伙食标准，没有根据新的情况及时加以调整，一般是偏宽偏高，不该享受的也享受了。不少学校对职工宿舍的房租、水电费、家具费收费过低，没有按当地国家机关的标准执行；由公家补助过多。有些属于应由个人负责解决也可能解决的家庭日常生活问题，也往往要求公家协助解决。
    总之，目前高等学校对勤俭办学的方针还未认真贯彻，艰苦奋斗勤俭朴素的作风还很差，这不仅浪费了国家的人力、物力、财力；而且助长了师生员工一切困难靠公家解决的依赖思想，同时也容易养成追求舒适，怕过艰苦生活，不愿下乡、下厂、下实验室，轻视体力劳动，轻视劳动群众，轻视实验室工作，忽视理论联系实际等不良倾向。因此，贯彻“勤俭办学”的方针，不仅是为了节省国家的人力、物力和建设资金，以加速我国的社会主义建设；同时也直接关系到我们要培养什么样的人才和在什么环境下培养人才，也就是如何正确地贯彻社会主义的教育方针问题。这是属于社会主义教育和资产阶级教育两条不同的教育路线问题，值得我们严重注意。
    指示说，为了结合整改，结合社会主义思想教育运动，认真贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办学的方针，希望各学校结合具体情况，认真研究贯彻以下几项工作：
    一、大力精简机构编制。目前高等学校机构庞杂、重叠、人浮于事的情况必须改变。各校应该加强劳动纪律，提高工作效率，坚决地紧缩机构，精简人员编制。并坚决贯彻中央关于组织和动员大批干部，特别是青年知识分子干部参加体力劳动的指示，有计划地组织全校教职员分批分期地参加必要的体力劳动的锻炼。对多余人员，根据不同的情况，按退休、退职、参加基层工作，或参加劳动生产等办法妥善处理。
    二、调整学生助学金标准。一般学生助学金的掌握使用，必须贯彻阶级路线，主要解决贫苦工农学生的困难。建立严格的审批制度，防止不合理和浪费现象的发生。学生助学金的标准应该和当地劳动人民的生活水平相接近。
    三、处理多余土地，节约基本建设投资。各校应该检查占用土地的情况，尽量纠正浪费土地的现象。凡是绿化园地、体育场、施工用地和实验实习场地等过大的应该坚决紧缩，因建筑密度不合规定标准，空地过多的，应该采取填空补白的办法加以利用。重新安排后，凡是1958年基建不需要的土地，应交给农民耕种，并在1957年冬处理完毕。同时，还要提高现有校舍利用率。对教职员工宿舍的居住水平也应该按国家规定的标准。凡是居住标准过高的，应该作合理调整。凡是原有校舍能调剂解决的用房，即不再扩建礼堂、体育馆、行政用房等。
    四、彻底清理教学设备，认真处理积压物资。各校对现有机器、仪器等设备、实验材料以及图书馆藏书，应该进行一次全面的彻底的清理，建立起健全的财产账目，严肃认真地处理积压物资。此外，还要节省经常开支，各项财务开支标准，应该考虑适当降低，尤其是行政费的开支。
    指示说，勤俭办学的方针是否能够贯彻，是否能够持久地坚持下去，关键在于领导，因此各校领导上应该把这一工作当作整改阶段的中心任务之一，当作自己经常的重要任务之一，采取一切必要的形式，有计划地向全体师生员工进行思想教育工作，充分发动群众，特别是要求发动教学人员，大胆地揭发任何铺张浪费现象，展开批评和自我批评，提高大家的社会主义思想觉悟。批判个人主义、本位主义思想和一切铺张浪费、不爱护公共财物的现象，树立起节约光荣，浪费可耻的风气，发扬艰苦奋斗的革命传统，以便正确地贯彻社会主义的教育方针，更有效地推进我国高等教育建设事业的稳步前进。
