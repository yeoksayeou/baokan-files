    Who Do Missiles Protect?
    American newspapers recently revealed the inside story of how American monopoly organizations get rich by producing rockets and missiles. People fully understand now for whom the US ruling authorities are clamoring to allocate billions of dollars to missile production. No wonder American monopoly capitalists are so enthusiastic about the US government's missile development plan. Two financial tycoons, McCloy and Lovett, patted Eisenhower on the chest and guaranteed that if he approved the plan they suggested, the American financial community would give full support. No wonder Eisenhower has been worried that the American people would refuse to pay for his arms expansion scheme, because he knows that his lie of speeding up missile production to safeguard American security will be exposed sooner or later, and the American people will eventually understand that Eisenhower wants them to tighten their belts only to let the monopoly capitalists widen their belts even more.

    导弹保障了谁
    美国报刊最近揭露了美国垄断组织通过生产火箭和导弹发财致富的内幕，人们就完全明白，美国统治当局大喊大叫要拨几十亿美元来搞导弹生产，究竟是替谁作嫁。难怪美国的垄断资本家对美国政府发展导弹的计划如此热心。两个金融界大老板麦克洛埃和罗维特曾向艾森豪威尔拍胸脯，保证如果批准他所建议的计划的话，美国金融界将给予完全的支持。也难怪艾森豪威尔一直担心美国人民拒绝出钱支持他搞这种扩军的勾当，因为他知道他把加紧生产导弹说成是为了保障美国安全的鬼话迟早会被揭穿，美国老百姓终会明白艾森豪威尔要他们勒紧裤带不过是为了让垄断资本家把裤带放得更宽。
