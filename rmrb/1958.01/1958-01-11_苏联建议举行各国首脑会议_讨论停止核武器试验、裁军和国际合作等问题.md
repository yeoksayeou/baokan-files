Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: TASS reports that "People's Daily" and "Guangming Daily" today published the full text of "The Soviet Government's Proposal on the Issue of Easing International Tension." In this document, the Soviet government proposes holding a high-level meeting of national leaders with the participation of heads of government within the next two or three months. The Soviet government believes that this meeting could first discuss issues that would meet the wishes of the people of all countries and would be an important beginning in fundamentally changing the international situation and stopping the "Cold War."

In the document, the Soviet government stated that the current international situation is characterized, on the one hand, by the continued "Cold War," especially the escalating arms race in the production of atomic and hydrogen weapons, which directly threatens the cause of world peace and the fate of all mankind; and on the other hand, by the enormous growth of forces advocating peace and security. The Soviet government fully agrees with the opinions of many national governments and the growing demands of the world's broad social circles that holding a high-level meeting of national leaders is in line with the goal of eliminating the danger of a new war. Such a meeting could find effective ways to solve the problems of deep concern to the people of all countries and could create the necessary shift in the development of international relations.

The Soviet government proposes that the high-level meeting of national leaders with the participation of heads of government should discuss the proposal to immediately cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons (at least for two or three years). Stopping the experimental explosions of atomic and hydrogen bombs would make everyone stop manufacturing new weapons with ever-increasing destructive and lethal power.

Of course, the meeting should have the opportunity to exchange views on other aspects of disarmament, especially since disarmament negotiations have now been interrupted and there are currently no conditions for resuming disarmament negotiations within the United Nations framework.

The document stated that the task of prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons, these weapons of mass destruction, has become increasingly urgent. The Soviet government has always hoped to reach an agreement with the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom on renouncing the use of such weapons.

The document then mentioned the Polish government's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. The document pointed out that the necessary prerequisites are now in place to allow this proposal to be immediately considered by the summit conference (initially, even if only in a four-nation framework).

The document pointed out that considering the issue of concluding a non-aggression pact between the member states of the North Atlantic Alliance and the member states of the Warsaw Treaty at such a meeting is in the interest of stopping the "Cold War" and stopping the expansion of armaments. The Soviet Union, like all other member states of the Warsaw Treaty, has repeatedly declared its willingness to conclude such a multilateral agreement, considering the importance of this step.

The document went on to say that reducing the number of foreign troops stationed on German territory, reducing the number of foreign troops in other countries, such as member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and member states of the Warsaw Treaty, especially the complete withdrawal of these troops, would greatly contribute to the normalization of the atmosphere in Europe (and not only in Europe). Considering that reaching an agreement on the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from the territories of the aforementioned countries would encounter serious difficulties (as historical experience has shown), the Soviet government believes that it is necessary for the countries concerned to reach an agreement on reducing the number of troops they station in the territories of the aforementioned countries, or at least reducing the number of troops stationed on German territory.

The document stated that it cannot be considered that it is now completely impossible to reach an agreement on the issue of preventing surprise attacks and on corresponding issues of supervision of disarmament measures. As long as the countries concerned have the desire to reach an agreement, it is possible to reach an agreement on these issues in the near future. Therefore, a series of measures must be discussed, such as setting up observation posts at railway intersections, major ports, and highway trunk lines to prevent the secret gathering of troops and the concentration of military equipment in preparation for surprise attacks. Given that some national governments consider aerial photography of the territories of some countries to be meaningful, it is proposed to reach the following agreement: the area on both sides of the dividing line between the two opposing military blocs in Europe, with a depth of 800 kilometers on each side, should be the aerial photography zone.

Considering the abnormal concentration of armed forces and military equipment on German territory in peacetime, and also considering the situation where the major national military blocs are directly confronting each other here, it is appropriate for the relevant countries, including the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, to consult on the issue of implementing broader supervision over measures in Germany that are now possible to reach an agreement on. Such measures may involve reducing the number of foreign troops in the two parts of Germany, followed by the complete withdrawal of these troops from Germany, and the relevant countries agreeing on the issue of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

The document then pointed out that the meeting could also discuss possible measures to expand international trade relations. At the same time, a situation must be created where international trade is not constrained by artificial legal barriers.

The Soviet government also advocates that this meeting should agree to take measures to stop war propaganda currently being conducted in some countries.

The document stated that holding talks between national leaders would make it possible to exchange views on ways to ease tensions in the Middle East and Near East, and it would be possible for major powers to agree not to take any steps that would undermine the independence of countries in this region and not to use force to resolve issues related to the Middle East and Near East.

The Soviet government believes that the time to solve the above-mentioned problems is not only ripe but also urgent. The meeting could also discuss other constructive suggestions that may be put forward by other participants and that would help stop the "Cold War." It could be agreed which issues should be discussed in the next stage of national negotiations at similar meetings or within the United Nations framework.

For example, it is well known that the US and British governments are unwilling to prohibit nuclear weapons, eliminate them from the armaments of all countries, and destroy existing stockpiles, with the result that the solution of the issue of stopping the production of military fissionable materials is deadlocked. In this situation, all issues related to the fundamental solution of the problem of atomic disarmament have to be postponed to a later stage of the negotiations, after agreements have been reached on simpler issues.

The document stated that, judging from the official statements of the governments of Western countries, it is probably impossible to expect member states of the North Atlantic Alliance to agree at present to the following proposals:

   * Substantially reduce armed forces and armaments and sign the necessary international agreements to this end;
   * Completely withdraw foreign armed forces from the territories of member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and member states of the Warsaw Treaty and remove all foreign bases from the territories of other countries;
   * Replace the existing military blocs in Europe with a collective security system.

At present, there is little reason to believe that submitting these issues to this meeting for discussion would yield positive results. Later, when some measures agreed upon at this meeting we are proposing have been implemented, thereby establishing a certain minimum of necessary international trust, appropriate conditions will arise to implement more thorough measures, including measures in the area of disarmament.

The document stated that it goes without saying that all issues directly related to the People's Republic of China can only be resolved with its participation. The Soviet government believes that it must reiterate that the policy of obstructing the direct participation of the People's Republic of China in dealing with outstanding international issues has caused serious damage to the entire international situation, especially to the activities of the United Nations.

Undoubtedly, stopping the "Cold War" and expanding international cooperation will also help resolve the German issue on the basis of the rapprochement between the two independent German states - the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The Soviet government has stated that it fully supports the proposal of the German Democratic Republic to establish a confederation of the two German states as a major step towards establishing a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany. If we talk about promoting German unification from the outside, then we must first recognize the fact that there are two German states and respect the sovereignty of each of them. The Soviet Union, as in the past, will continue to work to promote an agreement between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on the path to restoring German unification. Such an agreement would create the preconditions for concluding a peace treaty with Germany.

The document stated that, considering the nature of the issues that need to be discussed, it is appropriate to hold the aforementioned high-level meeting with the participation of representatives of all member states of the North Atlantic Alliance and all member states of the Warsaw Treaty. If there are difficulties in reaching an agreement on the issue of membership in such a meeting on the above-mentioned principles, the Soviet government does not object to fewer countries participating in the meeting.

The document stated that, given that the meeting will study the following issues, such as disarmament, stopping war propaganda, promoting the development of international trade, and some issues related to a large number of countries that have not participated in any bloc, the Soviet government believes that it is appropriate for countries such as India, Afghanistan, Egypt, Yugoslavia, Sweden, and Austria to participate in the meeting.

Finally, this situation may also be permitted: each of the above-mentioned groups may send two or three countries, or even one country each, to participate in the negotiations, at least in the first stage, if a corresponding agreement is reached in this regard.

The Soviet government believes that the meeting location can be set in Geneva with the agreement of the Swiss government.

In referring to the proposal to convene a meeting of foreign ministers, the Soviet government pointed out that it is still uncertain whether such talks will produce positive results.

The Soviet government believes that if heads of government directly participate in the meeting, then it will be easier to reach agreements at the meeting on all issues of stopping the "Cold War" and stopping the expansion of armaments, establishing the necessary trust in national relations, and creating conditions for lasting and durable peace. It goes without saying that, subsequently, holding another meeting of foreign ministers to further study the relevant issues and formulate the necessary agreements in accordance with the agreements already reached would be appropriate.

### 苏联建议举行各国首脑会议  讨论停止核武器试验、裁军和国际合作等问题

    苏联建议举行各国首脑会议
    讨论停止核武器试验、裁军和国际合作等问题
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社报道：“真理报”和“消息报”今天全文刊载了“苏联政府关于缓和国际紧张局势问题的建议”。在这个文件中，苏联政府建议在最近两三个月内举行有政府首脑参加的国家领导人高级会议。苏联政府认为，这个会议首先可以讨论这样一些问题，这些问题的解决将符合各国人民的心愿，并且将是根本改变国际局势和停止“冷战”方面的一个重要开端。
    苏联政府在文件中说，现在国际局势的特点一方面是，“冷战”正在继续进行，特别是在生产原子武器和氢武器方面的军备竞赛日益加紧，世界和平事业和全人类的命运受到直接威胁；另一方面是，主张和平和安全的力量有了巨大的增长。苏联政府完全赞同很多国家政府的意见和世界广大社会人士日益增强的要求，这就是举行各国领导人高级会议是符合消除新战争危险的目的的。这样的会议能够找到解决各国人民所深切关怀的问题的有效途径，并且能够使国际关系的发展形成必要的转变。
    苏联政府建议，在有政府首脑参加的国家领导人高级会议上，应该讨论关于立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器（至少停止试验两三年）的建议。停止原子弹和氢弹的试验性爆炸，就会使大家停止制造破坏力和杀伤力越来越大的新式武器。
    当然，会上应该有机会就裁军问题的其他一些方面交换意见，尤其是因为，裁军谈判目前已经中断了，而现在又没有条件在联合国机构内恢复裁军谈判。
    文件中说，禁止原子武器和氢武器这种大规模毁灭性武器的任务已变得越来越紧迫了。苏联政府始终希望同美国和英国的政府在放弃使用这种武器的问题上达成协议。
    文件接着提到了波兰政府关于在欧洲中部建立无原子武器地区的建议。文件指出，目前已经具备必要的前提，使得这个建议可以作为各国领导人会议（起初那怕首先在四国范围内）立即考虑的课题。
    文件指出，在这样的会议上考虑关于北大西洋联盟成员国和华沙条约成员国之间缔结某种形式的互不侵犯协定的问题，是符合停止“冷战”和停止扩充军备的利益的。苏联，同华沙条约所有其他成员国一样，考虑到这种步骤的重要意义，曾经一再声明愿意缔结这种多边协定。
    文件接着说，减少德国领土上的外国军队的数目，减少其他国家，如北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约成员国领土上外国军队的数目，尤其是全部撤退这些军队，对欧洲气氛的正常化（而且也不仅是对欧洲）具有很大作用。考虑到就全部撤退上述国家领土上的外国军队问题达成协议会遭到严重困难（这是历来的经验），苏联政府认为，有关国家就减少它们驻在上述国家领土上的军队数目、或者至少是减少驻在德国领土上的军队数目的问题达成协议，是必要的。
    文件说，不能认为，现在已经完全没有可能就防止突然攻击问题以及对裁军措施采取监督的相应问题达成协议，只要有关国家有达成协议的愿望，在最近时期内就可以在这些问题上达成协议。因此，必须讨论一系列的措施，如在铁路交叉点、大港口和公路干线设置监督岗，以防止暗中集结军队和集中军事技术装备作为突然攻击的准备。鉴于某些国家政府认为对一些国家领土进行空中摄影有意义，建议达成下列协议：以欧洲两个对立军事集团分界线的两边纵深各八百公里的地区为空中摄影区。
    考虑到在和平时期德国领土上不正常地结集着武装力量和军事装备，也考虑到主要的国家军事集团在这里相互直接对峙的局面，各有关国家，包括德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国在内，就在德国领土上对现在已经有可能达成协议的措施实行更广泛的监督问题进行协商是适宜的。这样一些措施可能涉及到裁减在德国两部分境内的外国军队人数、随后把这些军队从德国全部撤出，以及有关国家议定建立无原子武器地区问题。
    文件接着指出，在会议上也可以讨论实现扩大国际贸易关系的可能的措施问题。同时，必须造成这样一种局面，即国际贸易不受人为的法律上的障碍的约束。
    苏联政府还主张这个会议应当议定采取一些措施，来停止某些国家中目前所进行的战争宣传。
    文件说，国家领导人举行会谈，就有可能就缓和中近东的紧张局势的办法交换意见，并且可能就大国不采取任何破坏这个地区各国独立的步骤和不采取用武力解决有关中近东的问题达成协议。
    苏联政府认为，解决上述问题的时机不仅已经成熟，而且也很紧迫。会上也可以讨论可能由其他与会者提出的、有助于停止“冷战”的其他建设性建议。可以议定，哪些问题应当在下阶段各国谈判中在类似的会议上或联合国范围内加以讨论。
    例如，大家都知道，美国和英国政府不愿意现在禁止核武器、把这种武器从各国军备中取缔并销毁现有储备，结果就使停止生产军用裂变物质的问题的解决陷入僵局。在这种情况下，只好把与原子裁军问题得到根本解决的有关一切问题推迟到谈判的比较迟的阶段，推迟到在较简单的问题达成协议之后。
    文件说，从西方国家政府的官方声明看来，恐怕不能指望北大西洋联盟成员国在目前会同意下面的建议：
    大量裁减武装部队和军备并为此签订必要的国际协定；
    完全撤出北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约缔约国境内的外国武装部队并且撤除别国境内的一切外国基地；
    将欧洲现存的军事集团代之以集体安全体系。
    目前很少有根据认为，把这些问题提交这次会议讨论会得出肯定的结果。再迟一些，等到在我们建议的这个会议上商定的一些措施实现了，从而建立起了一定的、最起码的、必要的国际信任之后，将出现适当的条件来实行更为彻底的措施，包括裁军方面的措施。
    文件中说，不用说，直接关系到中华人民共和国的一切问题，只有在它的参加下才可能获得解决。苏联政府认为必须再次声明，阻挠人民中国直接参与处理悬而未决的国际问题的政策，给整个国际局势、首先是给联合国的活动带来了严重的损失。
    毫无疑问，停止“冷战”和扩大国际合作，还将有助于在两个自主的德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国彼此接近的基础上解决德国问题。苏联政府已经声明过，它完全支持德意志民主共和国的建议：建立两个德国的邦联，以作为建立统一的、爱好和平和民主的德国的一个重大步骤。如果谈到从外部来促进德国统一的话，那末，首先应该承认存在着两个德国这一事实，并且应该尊重它们中间每一个国家的主权。苏联同以往一样仍将致力于促进德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国就恢复德国统一的道路问题达成协议。这样的协议将会给缔结对德和约创造前提。
    文件说，考虑到需要讨论的问题的性质，举行有北大西洋联盟全体成员国和华沙条约全体成员国的代表参加的上述高级会议是适宜的。假如有困难，不能对这样的会议的成员问题在上述原则上达成协议，苏联政府也不反对参加会议的国家少一些。
    文件中说，鉴于在会上要研究下列一些问题，如裁军问题、停止战争宣传、促进国际贸易的发展以及关系到大批没有参加任何集团的国家的某些问题，苏联政府认为，像印度、阿富汗、埃及、南斯拉夫、瑞典、奥地利这样一些国家参加会议是适宜的。
    最后，还可以允许这种情况：上述集团中的每一个集团可以各派两三个国家、或者甚至各派一个国家参加谈判，至少是在第一阶段如此；假如在这方面达成相应的协议的话。
    苏联政府认为，会议地点可以取得瑞士政府同意设在日内瓦。
    在谈到关于召开外交部长级会议的建议时，苏联政府指出，这种会谈究竟能否产生积极的结果，尚无把握。
    苏联政府认为，如果各国政府首脑直接参加会议，那么，停止“冷战”和停止扩充军备、在各国关系方面建立必要的信任、为巩固的和持久的和平创造条件——所有这一切问题在会上将可以比较容易取得协议。不言而喻，随后，再召开外交部长级会议，以便根据已经达成的协议来进一步研究有关问题并拟定必要的协定，那将是适宜的。
