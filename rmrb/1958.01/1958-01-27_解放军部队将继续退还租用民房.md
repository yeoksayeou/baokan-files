Xinhua News Agency, January 25th - This year, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) garrisons in various locations will continue to return the civilian housing they originally rented to their owners and will not rent any new civilian housing. This decision was made at the All-Army Barracks Management Work Conference, which concluded on the 23rd.

In recent years, while building their own barracks through self-reliance, the PLA garrisons in various locations have already returned most of the temporarily rented civilian housing to their owners. Last year alone, the troops returned more than 72,400 rooms of civilian housing.

This conference studied the usage of barracks after the return of family members to their hometowns and the transfer of officers to lower levels, and concluded that it is possible to return even more civilian housing. To this end, it is stipulated that, except for coastal defense, border defense troops, air defense troops, railway corps, and national defense project construction troops that have genuine practical needs and can continue to rent civilian housing for rational use, other troops are generally not allowed to rent new civilian housing from March of this year onwards, and they must return the originally rented civilian housing as soon as possible.

    解放军部队将继续退还租用民房
    新华社25日讯　中国人民解放军各地驻军今年将继续把原来租用的民房退还原主，并且不再新租民房。这是23日结束的全军营房管理工作会议作出的决定。
    几年来，解放军的各地驻军在自己动手建造营房的同时，已经把暂时租借的大部分民房退还原主。单是去年，各部队就退还了民房七万二千四百多间。
    这次会议研究了家属还乡和军官下放后的营房使用等情况，认为有可能退还更多的民房。为此规定：除了海防、边防部队、防空部队、铁道兵部队和国防工程施工部队等确有实际需要的，可以继续租用民房加以合理使用外，其它部队从今年3月起一般不准再新租民房，并且要将原来租用的民房尽早退还。
