What Harm Do Mosquitoes Cause?

Mosquitoes are widely distributed in China. Except for some "four-without" towns and villages (referring to areas free of pests and diseases), mosquitoes can be found in almost every inhabited area during certain seasons. Mosquitoes spread various diseases in China, the most important of which are malaria, filariasis, and epidemic Japanese encephalitis.

Malaria, also known as "ague" or "shivering disease," is a parasitic disease. It seriously affects people's health, and some patients with malignant malaria may die. Malaria is a very serious epidemic in southern China. In some areas of Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Hainan Island, the infection rate among residents can reach over 90%. For example, according to a survey of 312 newborn infants in six townships on Hainan Island from 1954 to 1955, 309 infants (99.3%) contracted malaria within one year of birth. People living here, whether local or from elsewhere, quickly became infected with malaria. Mild malaria also exists in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Heilongjiang in China. Therefore, malaria occurs in China from south to north, from east to west. The south is the most severe, the north is the least, and in the middle zone (including from Hunan to Hebei), the malaria infection rate can range from about 50% to 0.1%.

Filariasis is a chronic parasitic disease. People with filariasis have many small worms in their blood, which can only be detected by blood tests at night. Early-stage filariasis patients may not feel any discomfort. Some patients may develop lumps in their groin during strenuous labor, with a red line appearing below the lump and the leg swelling, accompanied by fever, making it impossible to continue working. After several such episodes, the skin on the legs and scrotum of filariasis patients gradually becomes rough and thick. This condition is medically called "elephantiasis" and commonly known as "thick legs and big eggs." Filariasis is quite widespread in China, with thirteen provinces affected by this disease. The number of infected people is quite large. The infection rate among residents in epidemic areas is generally around 10%-20%, and can be as high as 50% or more. Even in villages in southern Shandong, where the mosquito activity season is relatively short, the filariasis infection rate can still be as high as about 30%. There are two types of filariasis: one is Malayan filariasis, whose main symptom is swelling of the legs and feet, called "big foot disease," mainly distributed in mountainous areas of the south; the other is Bancroftian filariasis, whose main symptom is swelling of the legs and feet, as well as swelling of the scrotum, called "big egg," mainly distributed in plain areas such as southern Shandong and Jiangsu.

Epidemic Japanese encephalitis is an acute infectious disease caused by a virus. Children under the age of fifteen are more likely to get the disease, generally occurring in July, August, and September each year. Those infected experience fever, headache, vomiting, convulsions, and drowsiness. If severely ill people do not receive timely treatment, they will die quickly. According to statistics, the average mortality rate of epidemic Japanese encephalitis in China in 1952 was as high as about 30%. Some people who have had epidemic Japanese encephalitis, even if cured, may develop some sequelae. Although epidemic Japanese encephalitis occurs sporadically in China, the epidemic areas are very wide. This disease has also been found in northern China, such as Harbin, Shenyang, and Dalian.

From the brief introduction of the above three diseases, we can know how harmful mosquitoes are to humans. The Party and the government strongly call on us to eliminate mosquitoes in order to eliminate malaria, filariasis, and epidemic Japanese encephalitis. In order to effectively eliminate mosquitoes, it is necessary to first understand mosquitoes.

Mosquito Morphology and Ecology

A mosquito is a small insect with three parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. Below the center of the head is a proboscis that extends forward, which is longer than the head. The thorax has a pair of wings and three pairs of legs. The wings have very small scales. When a mosquito lands on a wall, its front two pairs of legs are placed on the wall surface, while the rear pair of legs is raised in the air behind and above (see Figures 4 and 5). (In summer, a mosquito-like insect is often found on the walls of courtyards, with the rear two pairs of legs placed on the wall surface and the front pair of legs raised forward and upward. Its proboscis is shorter than its head. This is a midge, not a mosquito. It does not bite people and will not transmit diseases.)

Mosquito development goes through four stages. It must go through egg, larva, and pupa before becoming an adult mosquito. Female mosquitoes must lay their eggs on the water surface. The eggs are all elliptical. The eggs hatch into larvae, commonly called wrigglers. Larvae must live in water and die quickly if they leave the water. The larva molts four times before becoming a pupa. The shape of the pupa is like a comma. When the pupa matures, a longitudinal crack will appear on its back, and the adult mosquito will emerge from the crack and fly to land to live.

We can divide disease-transmitting mosquitoes into three major categories using the following simple methods. The first category is Anopheles mosquitoes. Disease-transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes have black or white spots on their wings (see Figure 2). When an Anopheles mosquito lands on a wall, its body forms an angle with the wall, with the head close to the wall and the end of the abdomen far from the wall (see Figure 4).

The second category is Aedes mosquitoes. Disease-transmitting Aedes mosquitoes have no spots on their wings. Their bodies are mostly black, with many white markings on the body and legs, making them distinctively black and white (see Figure 1).

The third category is Culex mosquitoes. Disease-transmitting Culex mosquitoes also have no spots on their wings. Their bodies are yellowish-brown and have no white markings on the body and legs (see Figure 3). When Aedes and Culex mosquitoes land on a wall, their bodies are roughly parallel to the wall. This is different from Anopheles mosquitoes (see Figure 5).

Anopheles mosquitoes transmit malaria and filariasis. There are three main types of Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit malaria in China: *Anopheles minimus*, which transmits malaria in mountainous areas of the south; *Anopheles sinensis*, which transmits malaria in plain areas; and *Anopheles pattoni*, which transmits malaria in mountainous areas of the north. The breeding sites of these three types of Anopheles mosquitoes are different. The larvae of *Anopheles minimus* prefer cool, flowing water and use the hairs on their tails to hook onto weeds growing in the water to prevent being washed away by the flowing water. They are most likely to breed in mountain streams, creeks, and irrigation ditches in mountainous areas of the south. The larvae of *Anopheles pattoni* mostly breed in clean riversides or shallows in the middle of rivers in mountainous areas of the north. The larvae of the above two types of Anopheles mosquitoes prefer to live in cooler and cleaner water. Therefore, large numbers of larvae are only found in mountainous areas with more spring water. Since they breed in mountain streams and irrigation ditches or near streams, changes in the mountain water directly affect the larvae. When the rainy season arrives, the water flow in mountain streams or irrigation ditches increases, washing away large numbers of larvae. The number of larvae decreases, and the number of adult mosquitoes also decreases. *Anopheles pattoni* in the north appears in large numbers after the rainy season, and *Anopheles minimus* in the south appears in large numbers before or after the rainy season. This is closely related to whether Anopheles mosquito larvae can stay in the breeding site. It also shows that increasing the speed of water flow or removing weeds so that Anopheles mosquito larvae have no place to hide can wash away the larvae and reduce larval breeding. The larvae of *Anopheles sinensis* prefer to breed near aquatic plants or *Spirogyra* in large areas of stagnant water such as lakes, reservoirs, ponds, ditches, swamps, and rice fields. In addition to transmitting malaria, Anopheles mosquitoes also transmit filariasis. Malayan filariasis in mountainous areas of the south is mainly transmitted by *Anopheles sinensis*. Recently, Chinese scientists have further proved that *Anopheles sinensis* has different types. The small *Anopheles sinensis* that grows in cool, shaded rice fields plays a major role in transmitting filariasis. It is very likely that this type of *Anopheles sinensis* is equally important for malaria transmission.

Culex mosquitoes transmit Bancroftian filariasis and epidemic Japanese encephalitis. The main vectors of these two diseases are *Culex pipiens pallens* in the north and *Culex quinquefasciatus* in the south. The breeding sites of these two types of Culex mosquitoes are similar, preferring to breed in sewage near human settlements, such as sewage pits, sewage ditches, manure pits, and basins or jars containing sewage.

Aedes mosquitoes can also transmit epidemic Japanese encephalitis. Both *Aedes albopictus* and *Aedes koreicus* have been experimentally confirmed to transmit the virus, and viruses have also been isolated from natural *Aedes albopictus*. *Aedes koreicus* mainly breeds in rainwater accumulated in tree holes. *Aedes albopictus* has a wider range of breeding sites. Larvae of *Aedes albopictus* can be found in small containers such as basins and jars, bamboo tubes, and tree holes where small amounts of clean water accumulates.

Adult mosquitoes are divided into males and females. Female mosquitoes suck blood, while male mosquitoes suck plant juices and do not suck blood. *Anopheles minimus*, *Culex pipiens pallens*, *Culex quinquefasciatus*, small *Anopheles sinensis*, and *Aedes albopictus* all like to suck human blood. When these mosquitoes cannot suck human blood, they also suck the blood of domestic animals. It is not yet clear what animals *Aedes koreicus* and *Anopheles pattoni* like to suck the most, but it is certain that both of these mosquitoes can suck human blood. Only mosquitoes that suck human blood can transmit human diseases. The time when various mosquitoes suck blood is also different. Aedes mosquitoes can suck blood during the day, while Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes suck blood at dusk or at night. After sucking blood, mosquitoes look for dark and humid places to hide. Most of the nutrients from the blood they suck are used for the development of eggs in their bodies. When the blood is digested, the eggs are also mature. The mosquito then flies out of the hiding place to lay eggs in the water. After laying eggs, it flies to suck blood again. From the above habits of adult mosquitoes, we can know that except for Aedes mosquitoes, mosquitoes are active, fly, and are not easy to eliminate at night. But during the day, mosquitoes are hidden in hiding places and do not fly around. If their hiding places can be found, it is easy to eliminate them. *Culex pipiens pallens*, *Culex quinquefasciatus*, *Anopheles minimus*, small *Anopheles sinensis* all like to hide indoors where they will not be smoked, behind furniture against the wall, under the bed, in clothes that are not worn, in mosquito nets, or on the walls of darker rooms. In addition to hiding in human dwellings, Anopheles mosquitoes also often hide on the walls and roofs of livestock sheds.

Culex mosquitoes lay eggs near people's homes, suck blood in people's dwellings, and have a small range of activity. The egg-laying sites and blood-sucking sites of Anopheles mosquitoes are far apart, so the range of activity is much larger and the flight distance is longer. According to Soviet experience, Anopheles mosquitoes can generally fly three to five kilometers when there is no strong wind. In rural villages and towns, the population is small and there are few livestock, so the attraction to Anopheles mosquitoes is not great. Anopheles mosquitoes more than three kilometers away from such villages and towns will not fly to the villages and towns. If it is a city, the population is large and the attraction to Anopheles mosquitoes is strong, it can attract Anopheles mosquitoes within five kilometers to the city. But when there is wind, mosquitoes can fly farther, exceeding five kilometers.

Mosquito activity and survival are closely related to the outside temperature. In southern China, when the winter temperature is often above 10°C, mosquitoes can be active, suck blood, and lay eggs all year round. But in the cold north, when the winter temperature is below 10°C, mosquitoes must adapt to the environment and use various methods to spend this severe cold season. Different mosquitoes have different ways of overwintering. Aedes mosquito eggs are resistant to dryness and cold. In autumn, Aedes mosquitoes lay their eggs in tree holes or small containers of water. After the water dries up, the eggs stick to the edge of the tree hole or container, or mix in the soil underneath. When winter comes, the adult mosquitoes and larvae of Aedes mosquitoes die, but the eggs still maintain their ability to survive. The following summer, after the rainy season arrives, the tree holes and small containers are filled with rainwater again, and the eggs quickly hatch into larvae. Culex mosquitoes overwinter as adults. When the weather gets cold, Culex mosquitoes begin to convert the nutrients obtained from blood-sucking into fat droplets and store them in their bodies. When the temperature drops to around 10°C, after storing enough food, they fly to places that are not easily disturbed, darker, humid, and warmer to overwinter, neither eating nor moving. When spring comes the following year and the weather warms up, with the temperature often above 10°C, they start to be active again, suck blood, and lay eggs. The overwintering sites of Culex mosquitoes are inside warm houses, cellars, sweet potato cellars, abandoned wells, ditches, etc. The overwintering method of *Anopheles sinensis* is similar to that of Culex mosquitoes. The overwintering sites are crevices in caves, underground waterways, air-raid shelters, or bunkers. The larvae of *Anopheles pattoni* are not afraid of freezing and can overwinter in ice. After the ice melts the following year, they continue to develop.

Mosquito Elimination Methods

After understanding the types and ecology of mosquitoes, different measures can be taken to eliminate mosquitoes. The principle of mosquito elimination is to select the weakest link in the entire development period of mosquitoes as the focus, seize the opportunity, and use various appropriate methods on a large scale to eliminate mosquitoes according to the different conditions in each region, and to regularly carry out comprehensive prevention and control measures against various mosquitoes as an aid, in order to achieve the goal of eliminating mosquitoes.

The most effective and commonly used mosquito control drugs are DDT and BHC (lindane). Both of these drugs are residual insecticides. When these drugs are sprayed on the wall and dry, the drugs become small crystals that adhere to the wall surface. If a mosquito lands on the sprayed wall and comes into contact with the drugs, the drugs dissolve in the oil on the mosquito's epidermis and then penetrate into the mosquito's body, which can kill the mosquito within a few hours. The insecticidal effect of these two insecticides can last for a long time after being sprayed once. Spraying DDT once can maintain the effect for at least three months, and spraying BHC once can maintain the effect for at least one month. Both DDT and BHC have two types: emulsion and wettable powder. When spraying DDT on the wall to eliminate adult mosquitoes, first mix the DDT emulsion or wettable powder with water to prepare a liquid containing 2.5%-5% pure DDT, put it in a sprayer, and spray the drugs evenly on the wall surface according to the following method, with the nozzle one meter away from the wall. (If the spray cylinder is small and the spray power is not strong, it should be closer to the wall.) If the wall surface is an earthen wall or lime wall that is relatively easy to absorb water, DDT can be mixed into a liquid containing 2.5% pure DDT, and 60-80 ml should be sprayed on each square meter of the wall surface; if the wall surface is not easy to absorb water, DDT can be mixed into a liquid containing 5% pure DDT, and 20-30 ml should be sprayed on each square meter. In this way, there will be one to two grams of pure DDT on each square meter of the wall surface. If the medicine drips down from the wall after spraying, you should change to spraying a small amount of DDT with a higher concentration. The spraying method of BHC is similar to that of DDT, but the concentration of the mixture is different. Mix BHC emulsion or wettable powder with water to prepare a liquid containing 0.25% BHC gamma-isomer (BHC gamma-isomer is the effective insecticidal component in BHC. When calculating the amount of BHC, it is calculated according to the amount of gamma-isomer. The BHC produced in China generally contains 6% gamma-isomer), and evenly spray 60-80 ml per square meter on walls that easily absorb water, or mix it into a liquid containing 0.5% gamma-isomer, and evenly spray 20-30 ml per square meter on walls that absorb less water. No matter which spraying method is used, the final goal is to have 0.1-0.2 grams of BHC gamma-isomer per square meter of wall surface.

Because DDT and BHC are toxic to humans, when spraying, bowls, chopsticks, pots, spoons and food in the room must be moved outdoors. The person spraying must wear a mask and gloves, and other people should go outdoors to avoid poisoning.

When spraying, be careful to spray the drugs directly on the wall, and do not spray them in the air. If they are sprayed in the air, the drugs will soon fall on the ground and will not have an insecticidal effect.

BHC can also be made into smoke. When BHC is heated to 100-200°C, it can turn into smoke, which also has insecticidal effects. The BHC smoke agent generally purchased is made by heating BHC powder with a chemical smoke agent.

Now let's talk about how to eliminate mosquitoes. Mosquito elimination can be started from two aspects: eliminating larvae and eliminating adult mosquitoes.

The best way to eliminate larvae is to eliminate their breeding conditions. To achieve this goal, we must closely integrate with water conservancy or sanitation projects to carry out work. Winter rural water conservancy construction is a good opportunity to eliminate the breeding conditions of Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes. Irrigation ditches, streams, swamps, sewage ponds, stagnant water, etc. full of weeds can breed larvae of various mosquitoes. When building water conservancy projects, combine them with dredging the irrigation system to drain the standing water on the ground. When repairing old irrigation ditches, remove weeds and straighten the banks of the ditches so that mosquito larvae have no place to hide and are washed to death or washed away by the water. In cities, turn open ditches that drain sewage into covered ditches, and turn stagnant sewage ponds into flowing clean water ponds, build the banks with bricks or stones, and regularly remove aquatic plants so that mosquitoes cannot breed. At the same time, whether in cities or villages, fill in low-lying areas that easily accumulate rainwater to avoid creating many new mosquito breeding grounds after the rainy season.

Last year's vigorous water conservancy projects in winter built many small reservoirs and irrigation ditches. If these water conservancy projects are not regularly managed, they will become good breeding grounds for mosquitoes. In order to prevent mosquitoes from breeding in reservoirs, aquatic plants such as weeds and *Spirogyra* in the reservoir must be regularly removed. Farmers can be encouraged to collect aquatic plants to accumulate fertilizer. At the same time, fish that eat aquatic plants, such as grass carp, can be raised in the reservoir to use fish to remove aquatic plants, so mosquitoes will not easily breed. The irrigation ditches connected to the reservoir must be regularly removed from the grass on the banks. At the same time, the reservoir can release water every seven to ten days to flush the irrigation ditch. This will increase the flow rate of the water in the irrigation ditch, and without aquatic plants, the mosquito larvae can be washed to death.

Rice fields in summer and autumn are also places where mosquitoes breed. Because rice fields cover a relatively wide area, it is difficult to spray all insecticides. If there are scattered residential areas in the rice field area, the work of killing adult mosquitoes in residential areas can be strengthened with insecticides. If the residential areas are relatively concentrated, in addition to killing adult mosquitoes in the residential areas, we can consider trying intermittent water drainage in the rice fields within two to three kilometers near the large residential areas. Under the guidance of technicians and without affecting the growth of crops, drain the water every seven to ten days for two to three days. This can dry out the larvae before they mature. Without larvae in the rice fields near the residential areas, the number of adult mosquitoes in the residential areas will be greatly reduced. In addition, or in conjunction with agricultural pest control methods, use BHC, etc. to spray on the rice fields to kill mosquito larvae.

Another way to eliminate mosquito larvae is to use a large number of fish that devour mosquito larvae to eliminate the larvae. Experiments have proved that *Pseudorasbora parva* and *Macropodus opercularis* can swallow a large number of mosquito larvae and have practical value, which is adopted in breeding sites that are not easy to change or eliminate (such as swamps, reed ponds, etc.).

In some areas, water pits used for accumulating fertilizer or soaking hemp can become good breeding grounds for *Culex pipiens pallens* after rain. The number of these pits is not large, so the larvae of Culex mosquitoes are highly concentrated, making them an ideal place to eliminate them. Because the water in the pits is heavily polluted, the insecticidal effects of DDT and BHC are greatly weakened. In this case, a small amount of oil such as kerosene or waste oil can be sprinkled in the pits. If kerosene is used, sprinkling 30 ml per square meter can kill the larvae. Kerosene can gradually evaporate and will not be carried to the ground with the fertilizer to poison plants. The remaining kerosene on the water surface can also be burned off with fire before fertilization.

The method to eliminate Aedes mosquito larvae is to fill in tree holes, turn over basins and jars, and turn over all unused small containers that may accumulate water. The remaining parts of the harvested bamboo should be cut with a mouth to prevent water from being stored inside. Without water in the tree holes, bamboo tubes, and containers, Aedes mosquito eggs will not hatch. In summer and autumn, Aedes mosquitoes will have no place to lay eggs.

In addition to eliminating larvae, adult mosquitoes must also be eliminated. Winter, especially in the north, is a good opportunity to eliminate mosquitoes. In the winter in the south, the weather is colder than in the summer, and the breeding of mosquitoes is slower, and the number is smaller. Moreover, because the indoors and caves are warmer than the natural world, mosquitoes are concentrated indoors and in caves, or other places that can keep out the cold. This creates good conditions for mosquito elimination - the number of mosquitoes is small and concentrated. In the north, it is very cold in winter. The larvae of Culex and *Anopheles sinensis* mosquitoes are frozen to death, and a large number of adult mosquitoes are also frozen to death due to insufficient preparation or failure to find suitable overwintering sites. Only a small number of adult mosquitoes overwinter in the corners of caves, cellars, warm houses, etc. If these mosquitoes can be eliminated, these Culex and *Anopheles sinensis* mosquitoes will be eradicated, and the goal of mosquito elimination can be easily achieved. The specific method is to first conduct a thorough cleaning of the house to clean up the corners and dead corners of the walls, so that the mosquitoes hidden inside can be swept out. The swept out garbage can be burned or used as compost. In the south, because mosquitoes can still be active, spray BHC or DDT once after sweeping to achieve good results. For other overwintering sites of mosquitoes, such as warm houses, caves, or basements, BHC smoke agents can also be used. BHC smoke can kill overwintering mosquitoes in warm houses or cellars.

Mosquito elimination is a regular task. It should be organized with dedicated personnel responsible for different areas, regularly check whether there are mosquito larvae breeding in standing water within three to five kilometers near residential areas, and check whether there are adult mosquitoes lurking in dwellings and livestock sheds during the day, and where are the most. When larvae are found, they should be eliminated immediately. Small containers can have the water poured out, ponds should be sprayed with BHC, and tree holes should be filled. If a large number of adult mosquitoes are found lurking during the day, DDT or BHC should be sprayed to kill adult mosquitoes.

Generally speaking, the method to eliminate Aedes mosquitoes is mainly to turn over basins and jars and fill in tree holes, and then spray drugs to kill adult mosquitoes before the epidemic season of epidemic Japanese encephalitis. *Culex pipiens pallens* can eliminate overwintering mosquitoes in winter and eliminate larvae and adult mosquitoes in summer and autumn. *Culex quinquefasciatus* should also eliminate larvae and adult mosquitoes. The breeding grounds of *Anopheles sinensis* larvae are too wide, but most of the adult mosquitoes hide in livestock sheds or human dwellings during the day, and the drugs can be used to kill adult mosquitoes. In the north, attention should be paid to the work of eliminating overwintering mosquitoes. During the rainy season, the number of *Anopheles pattoni* and *Anopheles minimus* larvae decreases significantly. We can take the opportunity of the rainy season to launch the work of killing adult mosquitoes. During the rainy season, adult mosquitoes are concentrated indoors or in livestock sheds, which is also convenient for killing. In winter, the number of *Anopheles minimus* decreases and the larvae are relatively concentrated. At this time, the work of killing larvae and adult mosquitoes should also be strengthened.

In short, China has a vast territory and complex terrain, and there are many species of disease-transmitting mosquitoes. Their habits and breeding sites are also different. Therefore, we must regularly observe the mosquitoes that transmit diseases in the local area. Only by mastering the laws of their lives can we use the most effective methods to eliminate them according to their different situations.

    怎样消灭蚊子
    中国医学科学院寄生虫病研究所　刘尔翔
    蚊子有什么害处
    蚊子在我国分布很广，除了一些“四无”的城镇和乡村以外，几乎凡是有人的地方，都可以在一定的季节里发现蚊子。蚊子在我国散播着各种疾病，其中最主要的有虐疾、丝虫病和流行性乙型脑炎等。
    虐疾也叫做“打摆子”、“发虐子”，是一种寄生虫病。它严重地影响着人们的健康，有些患恶性虐疾的病人还会死亡。虐疾在我国的南方是一种很严重的流行病，在云南、广西、贵州和海南岛的某些地区，居民的感染率可以到90％以上。如1954年到1955年，据在海南岛六个乡对三百一十二个新生婴儿的调查，其中有三百零九个婴儿（即99.3％）在出生后一年之内就得了虐疾。在这里居住的人，当地的或是外来的，都很快的传染上了虐疾。在我国新疆维吾尔族自治区和黑龙江，也有轻度的虐疾。因此，我国自南到北，自东到西都有虐疾的发生。南部最重，北部最轻，而在中间地带（包括自湖南至河北）虐疾的感染率可自50％到0.1％左右。
    丝虫病是一种慢性的寄生虫病。得了丝虫病的人，血里有许多小虫子，必须在晚上验血才查得出来。早期的丝虫病人，自己不觉得有什么不舒服，其中有些病人在紧张的劳动时，大腿根上就会出现肿块，肿块下面出现一条红线，腿也跟着肿起来，同时病人也发起烧来，不能再劳动了。丝虫病人经过几次像上述的发作，腿和阴囊的皮肤就渐渐变粗变厚，这种皮肤在医学上叫做“橡皮肿”，一般人叫做“粗腿大蛋”。丝虫病在我国流行得相当广泛，全国有十三个省都流行着这种病。得病的人数相当多，流行区里的居民感染率一般在10％—20％左右，高的可达50％以上，即使在蚊子活动季节比较短的山东南部的乡村里，丝虫感染率还可以高达30％左右。丝虫病有两种：一种是马来丝虫病，它主要的病状是腿脚肿大，称为大脚病，主要分布在南方山区；另一种是班氏丝虫病，主要的病状除腿脚肿大外，阴囊也肿大，称为“大蛋”，主要分布在平原地区如山东南部及江苏一带。
    流行性乙型脑炎是由病毒引起的一种急性传染病，十五岁以下的儿童得病的比较多，一般都在每年7、8、9三个月里得病，得病的人发烧，头痛，呕吐，抽风，昏睡，病重的人，如果得不到及时的医治，就会很快的死亡。据统计，1952年我国全国流行性乙型脑炎的平均死亡率高达30％左右。有些得过流行性乙型脑炎的人虽然治好了，也会产生一些后遗症。流行性乙型脑炎在我国虽然是零散发生的，但流行的地区却很广，在我国的北部如哈尔滨、沈阳、大连等地也都发现过这种病。
    从上面三种病的简单介绍，我们就可以知道蚊子对于人是多么有害的一种昆虫。党和政府大力号召我们消灭蚊子，就是为了消灭虐疾、丝虫病和流行性乙型脑炎。为了有效地消灭蚊子，必需先了解蚊子。
    蚊子的形态和生态
    蚊子是一种小的昆虫，有头、胸和腹三个部分。头部的下面正中，有一根向前伸的口吻，口吻要比头长一些。胸部生着一对翅和三对腿，翅上有很小的鳞片。当蚊子落在墙上的时候，它的前二对腿放在墙面上，而后一对腿高举在后上方的空中（见图4、图5）。（夏天，时常在院内的墙上发现一种像蚊子的昆虫，后二对腿放在墙面上，而前一对腿举向前上方，它的口吻比头要短，这种是摇蚊，不是蚊子，它不叮咬人，也不会传染疾病。）
    蚊子的发育经过四个阶段，它要经过卵、幼虫和蛹才能变为成蚊。雌蚊必须在水面上产卵，卵都是椭圆形的。卵孵化就变为幼虫，通常叫做孑孓，幼虫必须生活在水里，离了水很快就死亡。幼虫脱四次皮就变为蛹，蛹的形状像个逗点。当蛹成熟后，其背面会产生一条纵的裂缝，成蚊就由裂缝里钻出来，飞到陆地上生活。
    我们可以把传染疾病的蚊子按照下面简单的方法分为三大类。第一类是按蚊。传染疾病的按蚊翅上有黑或白色的斑（见图2）。按蚊停落在墙上时，身体与墙面成一个斜角，头离墙面近，腹部末端离墙面远（见图4）。
    第二类是伊蚊。传染疾病的伊蚊翅上没有斑点，身体大都是黑色的，身体和腿上有很多白色的斑纹，显得黑白分明（见图1）。
    第三类是库蚊。传染疾病的库蚊翅上也没有斑，身体是黄褐色的，身体和腿上没有白色斑纹（见图3）。伊蚊和库蚊停留在墙上时，身体和墙面大致平行，这一点和按蚊不同（见图5）。
    按蚊是传染虐疾和丝虫病的蚊子。在我国传染虐疾的按蚊主要有三种：在南方山区传染虐疾的按蚊叫做微小按蚊；在平原区传染虐疾的是中华按蚊；在北方山区传染虐疾的是潘氏按蚊。这三种按蚊的孳生地点都不同。微小按蚊的幼虫喜欢清凉而流动的水，用尾部的毛钩着水里生长的杂草，以防被流动的水冲走，在南方山区的山水，溪流和灌溉沟中最容易孳生。潘氏按蚊的幼虫，大都在北方山区清净的河流两旁或中间的浅滩里孳生。上述两种按蚊的幼虫，都喜欢生活在温度较低而且清洁的水里，所以只有在山区泉水比较多的地方，才有大量的幼虫。由于它们都在山区的溪流和灌溉沟里或溪流的附近孳生，山水的变化会直接影响到幼虫。当雨季到来时，山区溪流或灌溉沟里的水流速加大，就把大量的幼虫冲走，幼虫的数量减少，成虫的数量也跟着减少。北方的潘氏按蚊在雨季之后才大量出现，南方的微小按蚊在雨季之前或在雨季之后才大量的出现，这与按蚊幼虫能否停留在孳生地内有密切的关系，同时也说明增加水流的速度，或除去水草而使按蚊幼虫没有可以躲藏的地方，就可以把幼虫冲走，减少幼虫的孳生。中华按蚊的幼虫喜欢在湖泊、水库、水塘、沟渠、沼泽、稻田等大片静水里的水草或水绵的附近孳生。按蚊除了传播虐疾以外，还传染丝虫病，南方山区的马来丝虫病主要是由中华按蚊传染的。最近我国的科学家又进一步证明中华按蚊有不同的类型，生长在清凉而有遮荫的稻田里的小型中华按蚊对传染丝虫病起主要的作用。很可能这种类型的中华按蚊对虐疾的传染，也有同等的重要性。
    库蚊是传染斑氏丝虫病和流行性乙型脑炎的蚊子。传染这两种病的主要媒介在北方是淡色库蚊，在南方是致倦库蚊。这两种库蚊的孳生地点是相似的，喜欢在人群附近的污水里孳生，如污水坑、污水沟、积肥坑，积有污水的盆或罐里都可以生长。
    伊蚊也可以传染流行性乙型脑炎，其中白纹伊蚊和仁川伊蚊都经过实验证实，由自然界的白纹伊蚊中，也分离出病毒来。仁川伊蚊主要是在树洞里聚积的雨水中孳生，白纹伊蚊的孳生地比较广，凡是少量聚积的清水中如盆、罐等小容器、竹筒、树洞里都可以找到白纹伊蚊的幼虫。
    成蚊分为雄雌两性，雌蚊吸血，雄蚊吸植物的汁液而不吸血。微小按蚊，淡色库蚊，致倦库蚊，小型中华按蚊和白纹伊蚊都喜欢吸人的血，这些蚊子，在吸不到人血时，也吸家畜的血。仁川伊蚊，潘氏按蚊最喜欢吸什么动物的血，现在还不十分清楚，不过可以肯定这两种蚊子都可以吸人血。吸人血的蚊子才能传染人的疾病。各种蚊子吸血的时间也有不同，伊蚊可以在白天吸血，库蚊和按蚊都在黄昏或夜晚吸血。蚊子吸了血之后，就要找比较暗和潮湿的地方隐蔽，所吸的血在胃里消化后，大部分营养都供给体内卵的发育，等血消化完了，卵也发育成熟，蚊子再飞出隐蔽场所，到水里去产卵。产完卵以后，再飞去吸血。由上述成蚊的习性，我们可以知道，除了伊蚊以外，蚊子都在夜里活动，飞翔，不容易消灭它们。但是在白天，蚊子都潜伏在隐蔽场所里，不到处飞行，如果能找到它的隐蔽场所，就容易消灭它。淡色库蚊，致倦库蚊，微小按蚊，小型中华按蚊都喜欢在不会被烟熏到的室内隐蔽，藏在靠墙的家具后面，床下，顶棚，不穿的衣服里面，蚊帐里，或在比较暗的屋子里的墙上。按蚊除了在人住的室内隐蔽以外，也时常躲在畜舍的墙上和屋顶上。
    库蚊都在人家附近产卵，在人的住室里吸血，活动范围不大。按蚊的产卵地点和吸血地点是离得很远的，所以活动范围就大得多，飞翔距离就远。根据苏联的经验，在没有大风时，一般的按蚊能飞三到五公里。农村里的村镇，人口不多，牲畜也少，因此对按蚊的吸引力不大，在这样的村镇四周三公里以外的按蚊就不会飞到村镇里来了。如果是城市，人口多，对按蚊的吸引力强，就可以把五公里以内的按蚊引到城市里去。但是在有风的时候，蚊子就可以飞得更远，会超过五公里。
    蚊子的活动和生存与外界的温度有密切的关系。在我国的南方，冬季的气温经常在10℃以上时，蚊子一年四季都可以活动吸血和产卵。但是在天气寒冷的北方，冬季的气温在10℃以下，蚊子就必需适应环境，用各种方法来度过这一严寒的季节。不同的蚊子，过冬的方法也不同。伊蚊的卵对干燥和严寒有抵抗能力。在秋天，伊蚊把卵产在树洞或小容器的水里，水干了以后，卵就粘在树洞或容器的边上，或混在底下的土里。冬天到了，伊蚊的成虫、幼虫都死掉了，而卵还保持生存的能力，到第二年夏天，雨季到来之后，树洞和小容器又被灌满雨水，卵很快就孵化出幼虫来。库蚊都是成虫过冬的，在天气变冷时，库蚊开始把吸血所得的营养变为脂肪滴，贮存在体内，当气温降到10℃左右时，它贮存了足够的食物后，就飞到不容易被惊动的，比较暗、潮和比较暖的地方去过冬，不吃也不动，等到来年春天，天气变暖，气温经常在10℃以上时，它又开始活动，吸血产卵。库蚊过冬的场所是在暖房、菜窖、白薯窖、废井、地沟等的里面。中华按蚊的过冬方法和库蚊相似，过冬的场所是山洞的缝隙、地下水道、防空洞或碉堡里。潘氏按蚊的幼虫不怕冰冻，可以在冰里过冬，第二年冰化以后，再继续发育。
    灭蚊的办法
    了解蚊子的种类和生态之后，就可以采取不同的措施来灭蚊了。灭蚊的原则是根据各地区的不同情况，选择蚊的整个发育时期中最弱的一环作为重点，抓紧时机，大规模的利用各种适当的方法来灭蚊，并经常的对各种蚊子进行综合性的防治措施作为辅助，才能达到消灭蚊子的目的。
    最有效而且最常用的灭蚊药物是二二三和六六六。这两种药物都是滞留性的杀虫剂，当这些药喷在墙上干了以后，药物就变为小的结晶，附着在墙面上，如果蚊子落在喷过药的墙面上和药物接触后，药物就溶在蚊子表皮上的油脂里，然后渗透到蚊体内，在几小时以内，就可以把蚊子杀死。这两种杀虫药喷洒一次以后，杀虫效果可以维持得很久，喷洒一次二二三，效果至少可以维持三个月，喷洒一次六六六，效果可以保持至少一个月。二二三和六六六都有乳剂和可湿性粉两种。为消灭成虫而把二二三喷洒在墙面时，先要把二二三的乳剂或可湿性粉用水配成含2.5％—5％纯二二三的液体，装在喷雾器里，按照下面的方法，将喷头离开墙面一公尺远，
  （如果喷筒小，喷出力不强，就要离墙更近一些。）把药物均匀的都喷洒在墙面上。如果墙面是比较容易吸水的土墙或石灰墙，可以把二二三配成含2.5％纯二二三的液体，每平方公尺的墙面上要喷洒60—80毫升；如果墙面是不容易吸水的，就可以把二二三配成含5％纯二二三的液体，每平方公尺喷洒20—30毫升，这样，每平方公尺的墙面上，就有了一到二克的纯二二三了。喷洒后，药液如果由墙上流下来，就应当改换喷洒少量浓度较高的二二三。六六六的喷洒方法和二二三相似，只是配制的浓度不同而已。把六六六的乳剂或可湿性粉用水配成含六六六丙体为0.25％的液体（六六六丙体是六六六中杀虫的有效成分，在计算六六六的用量时，都是按丙体的多少来计算。我国出产的六六六，一般都含6％的丙体），在容易吸水的墙面上，均匀的每平方公尺喷洒60—80毫升，或配成含丙体为0.5％的液体，在吸水较少的墙面上，均匀的每平方公尺喷洒20—30毫升。无论是用哪一种喷洒方法，最后要使每平方公尺的墙面上，含有0.1—0.2克的六六六丙体就可以了。
    因为二二三和六六六对人有毒，所以喷洒时，室内的碗筷锅勺和食物都要搬到室外，喷洒的人要带口罩和手套，其他的人到室外去，以免中毒。
    喷洒时要注意把药物直接的喷在墙上，而不要喷在空中，如果是喷在空中，药物不久就落在地上，起不了杀虫的作用。
    六六六还可以制成烟剂，当六六六被加热到100—200℃以后，就可以变成为烟，这种烟也有杀虫的效力。一般买到的六六六烟剂，是用化学的发烟剂把六六六粉加热而变成的。
    现在我们就谈一下如何灭蚊。灭蚊可以由灭幼虫和灭成虫两方面入手。
    灭幼虫最好的方法是消灭其孳生条件。为达到此目的，就要密切的结合水利或卫生工程来进行工作。冬季农村兴修水利是消灭按蚊和库蚊孳生条件的好机会。生满杂草的灌溉沟、溪流、沼泽、污水池、不流动的静水等，都可以孳生各种蚊的幼虫。在兴修水利时，结合疏通灌溉系统，把地面的积水排走。重修旧的灌溉沟时，要除去杂草，把沟的两岸修齐、修直，使蚊幼虫无法藏身，并使它被水冲击死亡或冲走。在城市里，要把排除污水的明沟变为暗沟，把不流动的污水池塘变为流动的清水池塘，用砖或石把岸砌起，经常清除水草，使蚊子无法孳生。同时不论在城市或乡村，要把易积雨水的低窪地填平，以免雨季过后，造成许多新的蚊子孳生地。
    去年冬季的大力兴修水利工程，建造了许多小型水库和灌溉沟渠，如果对这些水利工程，不经常地加以管理，就会成为蚊子的良好孳生地。为了防止蚊子在水库里孳生，必须经常清除水库里的水草、水绵等水中植物，可以鼓励农民打捞水中植物积堆肥，同时可以在水库里养吃水草的鱼，如青鱼等，利用鱼类把水草清除，蚊子也就不易孳生。与水库相连的灌溉沟渠要经常除去岸边的草，同时水库可以每隔七到十天放水冲刷一次灌溉沟，这样灌溉沟里水的流速增加，又没有水草，就可以把蚊幼虫冲击致死。
    夏秋的稻田也是蚊虫孳生的地方，因为稻田范围比较广泛，全部洒杀虫药是比较困难的。如果稻田区中有零散的居民点散在，可以加强居民点里用杀虫药灭成虫的工作。如果居民点比较集中，除了在居民点里灭成蚊以外，可以考虑在大居民点附近二到三公里以内的稻田，试行间歇放水法，在技术人员的指导和不影响农作物生长的条件下，每隔七到十天把水放干二到三天，这样就可以把幼虫在没有发育成熟以前干死，居民点附近的稻田里没有了幼虫，居民点里的成虫就会大量减少。除此之外，或可以结合农业上防治害虫的方法，用六六六等洒在稻田里杀灭蚊的幼虫。
    消灭蚊幼虫的另一种方法是利用大量吞食蚊幼虫的鱼类来消灭幼虫。实验已证明柳条鱼和中华斗鱼可以吞食大量的蚊幼虫，并有实用价值，在不容易改变或不容易消灭的孳生地中（如沼泽地带，芦苇塘等）采用。
    有些地区，积肥或浸麻用的水坑，下雨以后就可以成为淡色库蚊的良好孳生地，这些坑的数量不多，所以库蚊的幼虫就大量集中，是消灭它们的理想地点。由于坑里的水污染得很厉害，二二三和六六六的杀虫效果就减弱得很多，在这种情况下，可以在坑里洒少量的油类如煤油、废机油等。如用煤油，在每平方公尺洒入三十毫升就可以杀死幼虫。煤油可以渐渐挥发，不会和肥料一起带到地里毒死植物，也可以在施肥前，用火烧去水面上的残余煤油。
    消灭伊蚊幼虫的办法是填堵树洞，翻盆倒罐，把一切不用的，可能积水的小容器都翻过来，采伐过的竹子的剩余的部分，要切一个口，不让里面存水，树洞竹筒和容器里没有水，伊蚊卵就孵不出来，到了夏秋，伊蚊也没有地方去产卵。
    除了消灭幼虫以外，还要消灭成虫。冬天尤其在北方是灭蚊的好机会。在南方的冬天，天气比夏天冷，蚊虫的繁殖比较慢，数量就比较少，又因为室内、洞内比自然界暖和，蚊子都集中在室内和洞里，或其他能御寒的地方，这样就给灭蚊创造了良好的条件——蚊的数量少，而且集中。在北方，冬天很冷，库蚊和中华按蚊的幼虫都被冻死，大批的成蚊也由于准备不足，或没有找到合适的越冬场所而被冻死。只有小部分的成蚊在山洞里、菜窖、暖房等的角落里越冬，如果能把这些蚊子消灭掉，这些库蚊和中华按蚊就断了根，很容易就达到灭蚊的目的。具体的办法是首先进行房屋大扫除，把墙角、死角都打扫干净，这样就可以把藏在里面的蚊子扫出来。扫出去的垃圾可以烧掉或作堆肥用。在南方，由于蚊子还可以活动，扫除后要喷洒一次六六六或二二三，才能收到良好的效果。对于蚊子的其他越冬场所，如暖房、山洞或地下室等，也可以使用六六六烟剂，六六六的烟可以把暖房或菜窖里的越冬蚊子杀死。
    灭蚊是一项经常性的工作。应当组织起来，专人分区负责，定期检查居民点附近三到五公里内的积水是否有蚊幼虫的孳生，白天在住室和畜舍里检查有无成蚊潜伏，那里最多。当发现了幼虫之后，立即加以消灭，小的容器可以把水倒掉，水池应喷洒六六六，树洞要填堵。如果发现了大批成蚊白天潜伏的地方，要喷洒二二三或六六六以杀死成蚊。
    一般的说，伊蚊的消灭方法，以翻盆倒罐，填堵树洞为主，在流行性乙型脑炎流行季节之前再喷洒药物来灭成蚊。淡色库蚊可以在冬季灭越冬蚊，在夏秋季灭幼虫及成虫。致倦库蚊也应灭幼虫及成虫。中华按蚊的幼虫，孳生地太广，但成虫白天大部都隐藏在畜舍或人的居室内，可以药物灭成蚊为主，在北方应当注意灭越冬蚊的工作。潘氏按蚊和微小按蚊在雨季时，幼虫大量减少，可乘雨季的时机，展开灭成蚊的工作，雨季时成蚊都集中在室内或畜舍内，也便于杀灭。在冬季，微小按蚊的数目减少，幼虫比较集中，这时也要加强灭幼虫和成虫的工作。
    总之我国领土广阔，地形复杂，传染疾病的蚊种也不少，它们的习性、孳生地点也都不同，因此对当地传染疾病的蚊子要经常观察它们，只有掌握了它们生活的规律，才有可能针对其不同的情况，运用最有效的方法去消灭它。
