Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions Launch a Grand Competition for Thrifty School Management

    (Our dispatch) Sixteen higher education institutions in Jiangsu Province are launching a socialist competition focused on thrifty school management. Through this competition, they aim to gradually foster a new atmosphere of "diligent teaching, diligent study, diligent work" and "spending less money, accomplishing more, and doing good things."

    This competition was initiated by Nanjing University on January 18th, after carrying out an anti-waste movement, to encourage each other. The competition includes the following: First, after streamlining institutions, fully increase the teaching workload of teachers, ensure that the responsibilities of administrative staff are clear, and institutionalize physical labor for all staff and students, and achieve results. Second, fully utilize the utilization rate of instruments and equipment, clearly inventory existing materials, and resolutely hand over and support other schools with accumulated materials. Third, vigorously save on the use of rooms, especially administrative rooms, and strive to squeeze out 2,000 to 3,000 square meters of usable area, reduce new construction plans by 20%, and postpone some construction. Fourth, save as much water, electricity, rice, and coal as possible, requiring the annual average to be controlled within the quota to overcome overdrafts.

    After Nanjing University proposed this revolutionary initiative, it was immediately responded to by nine higher education institutions in Nanjing. Encouraged by the initiative, Nanjing Normal College held a meeting the same night to discuss and adopt a ten-point program of action, which decided to stop capital construction in 1958 and reduce foreign orders by one-half. Nanjing Institute of Technology plans to increase the classroom utilization rate to more than 46 class hours per week. 4,500 square meters of administrative rooms will be compressed and converted into teaching rooms. Nanjing Medical College occupies too much land and has now decided to return more than 2,000 square meters of land, and guarantees that no more teaching rooms will be built within three years. Nanjing Agricultural College decided to reduce the construction of houses by 3,000 square meters, which can save 1.5 million yuan in capital construction costs. In addition, Nanjing Agricultural College also proposed to improve teaching quality, and resolutely combine teaching and scientific research with production. Nanjing Institute of Technology proposed a plan to implement the class line and open the doors to workers and peasants, and decided to expand the enrollment of worker and peasant students to 40% of the total number of students this year.

    After the schools in Nanjing responded one after another, Nanjing University, the initiator of the competition, supplemented the initiative with a leap-forward revolutionary attitude, and specifically put forward more specific, comprehensive, and higher conditions for diligent teaching and diligent study, such as striving to ensure that the workload of general teachers can meet the prescribed standards, reducing the phenomenon of students failing, increasing the number of students and not increasing teaching staff after the summer vacation, using existing faculty to run worker-peasant preparatory classes during the second five-year plan, cultivating a diligent study style among students, and establishing good learning order, etc. Now, the socialist competition among higher education institutions in the province is deepening, and schools that have not responded are actively preparing to catch up.

    树立勤教勤学勤工作和少花钱多办事的新风气
    江苏高等学校展开勤俭办学大竞赛
    本报讯　江苏省十六所高等学校，正在以勤俭办学为主要内容，开展一个学校与学校间的社会主义竞赛。通过这个竞赛，逐渐形成“勤教、勤学、勤工作”，“少花钱，多办事，办好事”的新风气。
    这个竞赛是南京大学在开展反浪费运动之后，为了相互鼓励，在1月18日首先向全省高等学校提出倡议的。竞赛内容包括：一，在紧缩机构以后，充分提高教师教学工作量，行政工作人员做到人人职责明确，全校体力劳动制度化，并要做出成绩。二，充分发挥仪器设备占用率，把现有物资清点清楚，积压物资坚决上交与支援他校。三，大力节省用房，特别是行政用房，争取紧缩出二、三千平方公尺使用面积，新建计划缩小20％，部分建筑可以推迟。四，尽量节省水、电、米、煤，要求全年平均数控制在定额以内，克服超支现象。
    南京大学这一革命性的倡议提出后，立即得到南京市九所高等学校的响应。南京师范学院在倡议的鼓舞下，当晚集会讨论通过了十条行动纲领，其中决定1958年停止基本建设，国外订货削减二分之一。南京工学院准备将教室使用率做到每周四十六学时以上。紧缩行政用房四千五百平方公尺改作教学用房。南京医学院占地过多，现在决定退掉二千多平方公尺的土地，并保证在三年内不再建立教学用房。南京农学院决定少盖房屋三千平方公尺，可节约基本建设费一百五十万元。此外，南京农学院还提出了提高教学质量，教学和科学研究坚决与生产相结合的方针。南京工学院提出贯彻阶级路线，向工农开门的方案，决定今年要扩大招收工农学生占全部学生数的40％。
    南京市各校纷纷应战后，竞赛倡议者南京大学又以跃进的革命姿态补充倡议书，特别提出了勤教勤学方面的更具体更全面更高的条件，如争取一般教师工作量都能达到规定标准，减少学生不及格现象，暑假后学生增加教学人员不增加，在第二个五年计划期间以现有师资开办工农先修班，在同学中树立勤勉的学习风气，建立良好的学习秩序等。现在，全省高等学校之间的社会主义竞赛正在深入展开，没有响应的学校正在积极准备迎头赶上。
