    Let Them Have Enough Time to Labor!
    Jiangsu Nantong Agricultural School Gao Liang
    Currently, many schools and institutions are inviting students who previously participated in production to give reports, introducing the situation in the countryside and their experiences in labor.
    A high school graduate who has participated in agricultural production for less than three months was invited by his alma mater to return to school to introduce his labor experiences, production experiences, and how to cultivate feelings for the working people to the students at school. Then, other schools, as if they had found a treasure, invited him one after another to give labor reports. Newspaper reporters also followed suit, overwhelming him. He had to spend most of his labor time on giving reports and dealing with visitors. Because he didn't have much labor experience, but had to deal with those "reports," he had to repeat some general principles and other people's labor experiences published in newspapers and periodicals, which the listeners also found boring. This not only delayed production but also failed to achieve the purpose of educating others.
    Inviting comrades who participate in production to give reports for labor education is perfectly acceptable, but it is not good to find a young intellectual who has not participated in production for long to give reports. Because agricultural production is a long-term and arduous labor, it is impossible to obtain any "production experience" with just three or two months of labor. At the same time, a young intellectual's participation in rural production is only the beginning of transformation. It is impossible to cultivate "feelings for the working people" just by living in the countryside for dozens of days. On the contrary, frequently asking them to give reports in large venues will foster their complacency and be detrimental to transformation.
    Therefore, I hope that the agencies and schools in various places will invite fewer young people who have not participated in production for long to give reports, so that they have enough time to labor!

    让他们有足够的时间劳动！
    江苏南通农业学校  高粱
    目前，不少学校、机关都在请以前参加生产的学生作报告，介绍下乡情况，劳动体会。
    有个高中毕业生参加农业生产还不到三个月，他的母校就请他回校向在校同学介绍劳动体会、生产经验及如何培养劳动人民感情等问题。接着其它学校也像如获至宝的接二连三地请他作劳动报告，报社的记者也接踵而至，弄得他应接不暇，他只得把绝大部分的劳动时间花在作报告、应付来访者上。由于他并没有多少劳动体会，但又要应付那些“报告”，只得把些大道理及别人在报刊上发表的劳动体会重说一遍，听的人也觉乏味。这样既耽误了生产，又未达到教育别人的目的。
    邀请参加生产的同志作报告进行劳动教育，这是完全可以的，但是找一个参加生产不久的知识青年作报告，这就不好了。因为农业生产是一项长期的、艰巨的劳动，决不可能凭三月两月的劳动，就得出什么“生产经验”。同时，一个青年知识分子下乡生产仅是改造的开始，决不能因下乡住了几十天就培养起“劳动人民感情”来。相反的，经常请他们在大场合作报告，反而会滋长了他们的自满情绪，不利于改造。
    因此，我希望各地的机关、学校要少请参加生产不久的青年作报告，让他们有足够的时间进行劳动！
