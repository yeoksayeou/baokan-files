This newspaper reports:

    Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Heping Township, Chaoyang County, Guangdong, has set a new provincial record for fish pond yield per mu. Their high-yield fish pond produced over 6,400 jin of fish, averaging 1,920 jin per mu, breaking the 1956 Zhongshan County record of 1,818 jin per mu. The Hongguang Cooperative's total of 133 mu of fish ponds also achieved a bumper harvest, with a total output of over 88,700 jin.

    The Hongguang Cooperative achieved such a high fish pond yield primarily because they concentrated their efforts on solving the feed problem, extensively plowing mud to plant big-belly grass. Day and night, cooperative members went to the beach to pull weeds and cut grass. When feed was scarce, they even went to other counties to find it. Secondly, the Hongguang Cooperative effectively improved the pond quality and water quality, increased the pond's depth, and expanded the fish's range of activity to reduce fish diseases. Last year, the cooperative stocked fish fry one month earlier than in 1956. When transplanting the fish fry, they selected a large number of qualified and healthy fry. When stocking, they again selected fry with shiny scales and no injuries, resulting in a high survival rate and easy growth. For more than twenty days from before sowing to after stocking, the cooperative also concentrated all efforts on strengthening the pond base and culverts to prevent overflow and fish escape.

    This newspaper reports that the Taijiang Third Cooperative (now named Yinxiangpu Fish Farming Production Cooperative in Taijiang District), which set Fujian's highest freshwater fish farming yield record in 1956, achieved another comprehensive bumper harvest in 1957. Over 132 mu of fish ponds averaged 639 jin per mu, of which 5.91 mu of fish ponds averaged 1,100 jin per mu, breaking the 1956 provincial record of 1,085 jin per mu.

    The main reasons for the high yield of freshwater fish raised by the cooperative in 1957 are: first, the stocking quantity was increased; second, the advanced fish farming method of supplementary stocking was fully adopted, which improved the utilization rate of fish ponds; third, timely and reasonable phased harvesting methods were adopted; fourth, feeding management was strengthened, grass was frequently added, fertilizer was carefully applied, and the phenomenon of "pond overturn" (fish floating on the surface after death) was reduced. Due to the widespread bumper harvest of the cooperative's fish farming industry, the income of cooperative members also increased. It is estimated that the average household income in 1957 increased by more than 80 yuan compared to 1956.

### 广东潮阳红光社一口塘亩产鱼一千九百多斤  福建台江银湘浦社一个池亩产鱼一千一百斤  创造了全省最高纪录

    广东潮阳红光社一口塘亩产鱼一千九百多斤
    福建台江银湘浦社一个池亩产鱼一千一百斤
    创造了全省最高纪录
    本报讯　广东潮阳县和平乡红光农业社创造了全省鱼塘亩产量的最高纪录。该社的一口丰产鱼塘共产鱼六千四百多斤，平均每亩一千九百二十斤，打破了1956年中山县亩产一千八百十八斤的最高纪录。红光社全社一百三十三亩鱼塘，也获得大丰收，总产量为八万八千七百多斤。
    红光社获得这样高的塘鱼产量，首先是他们集中力量解决了饲料问题，大规模翻涂泥种大肚草，不论昼夜，社员们总是到海滩拔茜割草，在饲料最缺乏的时候，他们还到别的县找寻饲料。其次，红光社切实做到改良塘质水质，增加塘的深度，扩大鱼的活动范围，以减少鱼病。去年，该社放养鱼苗的时间比1956年早一个月，鱼种移殖时他们挑选了大批符合规格而体质健壮的鱼种，放养时，再选择鳞片有光泽没有受伤的鱼种，因而成活率高，又易长大。下种前至放养后二十多天时间内，该社又集中全力坚固塘基和涵管，以防溢水逃鱼。
    本报讯　福建创1956年全省淡水养鱼最高丰产纪录的台江第三社（现名台江区银湘浦养鱼生产社），1957年又获得了全面大丰收，一百三十二亩多鱼池平均每亩产量达六百三十九斤，其中有五亩九分一的鱼池平均亩产一千一百斤，突破了1956年全省最高单位面积产量一千零八十五斤的纪录。
    该社1957年所养的淡水鱼所以获得丰产的主要原因是：一、增加了放养量。二、全面采用补充放养的先进养鱼方法，提高了鱼池利用率。三、采取适时的合理分期收获办法。四、加强了饲养管理，勤投草，慎施肥，减少了“泛池”（鱼死后浮在水面）的现象。该社养鱼业由于普遍获得了大丰收，社员也增加了收入，据估计：1957年平均每户比1956年增加了八十多元的收入。
