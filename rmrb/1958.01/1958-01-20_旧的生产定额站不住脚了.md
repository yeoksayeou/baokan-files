    ——The Old Production Quotas Can No Longer Stand——
    Workers at the Beijing First Automobile Accessories Factory have launched a high tide of speaking out against conservatism and waste, and revising old quotas.
    The workers in this factory are paid on a piecework basis. In recent years, due to continuous improvements in operating methods and tools, production efficiency has greatly improved, but the production quotas have not changed. During the Rectification Campaign, while criticizing the leadership's conservative thinking, the workers resolutely demanded an increase in production quotas. Many workers actively tried to improve tools, and advanced young workers organized "Anti-Waste Youth Shock Brigades," "Youth Pioneer Teams," and "Locomotive Teams," etc., to promote the factory's Great Leap Forward in production.

    Right picture: After the old workers in the tool room renovated the tools, they worked better and faster, and the old production quotas became even more untenable.

    ——旧的生产定额站不住脚了——
    北京第一汽车附件厂工人掀起了反保守、反浪费、修改旧定额的鸣放高潮。
    这个厂的工人是拿计件工资的。近年来由于不断地改进操作方法，改善工具，生产效率大大提高，但是生产定额并没有改变。整风运动中，工人们在批评领导上的保守思想的同时，坚决要求提高生产定额。许多工人积极想法改进工具，先进青年工人组织了“反浪费青年突击队”、“青年先锋队”、“火车头队”等，推动工厂的生产大跃进。（附图片）
    左图：金工工段青年工人、火车头队队员王汝南将自己的实际生产效率写在大字报上，要求降低工时定额。
    右图：工具室的老工人把工具翻新后，干活就会更好更快，旧的生产定额就越发站不住脚了。
