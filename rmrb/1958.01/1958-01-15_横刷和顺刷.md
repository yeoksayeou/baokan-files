     Horizontal Brushing and Vertical Brushing
     Zhu Yu
    Many people use a back-and-forth horizontal brushing method when brushing their teeth. This is a wrong and perfunctory brushing method.
    Why brush your teeth?
    Some people do it to make their teeth whiter. Actually, this is impossible. The surface of the teeth is composed of enamel, which, although it is the hardest substance in the human body, will still be damaged if you brush it vigorously with the horizontal brushing method over a long period of time. And this enamel, once damaged, cannot be regenerated. Moreover, teeth are not naturally pure white (although they are the whitest thing in the human body). Some people's teeth are whiter, and some are not so white, and both are normal. If there are stains (mostly from smoking, drinking tea, or other food deposits), you can only ask a dentist to scrape them off. But there is a type of mottled tooth (some are brown or white spots) caused by drinking water containing too much fluoride before the teeth have fully developed, so it is also called fluorosis. Datong in Shanxi, Liling in Hunan, and Weining in Guizhou have the most people with fluorosis because those places produce the most fluorine. Fluorosis cannot be scraped off, and bleaching can only be used to lighten the color a bit. Actually, there is no need, because although it looks unsightly, it has an anti-caries effect.
    The correct purpose of brushing your teeth is: to clean your teeth, reduce the chances of getting dental diseases; and to promote blood circulation in the gum tissue, so that it enhances its ability to resist dental diseases. The horizontal brushing method can also clean the outer part of the teeth, but it cannot brush the inner, concave, and interdental spaces—which are the areas in the mouth most prone to accumulate dirt and grime, and food residues like to hide in them. After a while, they will ferment and rot, not only causing bad breath but also easily leading to cavities. Horizontal brushing can also easily injure the gums. Especially the gums between the two teeth, which are more prominent, forming a curved arc, are the first to bear the brunt of the back-and-forth stimulation of the toothbrush bristles, often causing redness, swelling, or bleeding.
    The reasonable brushing method is the vertical brushing method. On the outer part, place the toothbrush on the teeth with the bristle tips pointing towards the gum end, brush down from the upper teeth, and brush up from the lower teeth; the same is true for the inner part, except that the toothbrush should be held vertically to make it easier to brush; the concave part can be brushed from side to side or back and forth. In short, as long as you follow the direction of the teeth, using a variety of methods such as picking, teasing, pushing, and pulling, brushing each place five or six times, you can clean the tooth surface and interdental spaces, and the gums can receive appropriate friction.
    It is best to brush your teeth after every meal. If this is not possible, brush before going to bed and after getting up. If this is still not possible, at least brush before going to bed. Rinsing your mouth is also good at other times.

     横刷和顺刷
     朱俞
    许多人刷牙是用的推来拉去的横刷法。这是一种错误的、流于形式的刷法。
    为什么刷牙？
    有的人是为着叫牙齿变得白一些。其实办不到。牙齿的表面是釉质（珐琅质）构成的，虽然它是人体中最硬的东西，但如果用横刷法拼命刷它，年深月久，也会使它受损，而这釉质缺损了又是不能再生的。况且牙齿生来就不是纯白的（虽然它已是人体中最白的东西了），有人白些，有人不太白，都是正常的。如果有污渍（大都是吸烟、饮茶，或者其他食物沉渍下来的东西），只有请牙医去刮除。但有一种黄斑牙（也有的是棕色或白色的斑），是在牙齿还没有发育完全的时候，饮用了含有过多氟化物的水的缘故，所以又叫氟斑牙。我国山西大同、湖南醴陵、贵州威宁等地，有氟斑牙的人最多，因为那里是产氟最多的地方。氟斑牙刮不掉，只可用漂白的办法，把颜色减浅一点。其实也不必，因为虽然难看些，它却有抗龋的作用。
    刷牙的正确目的是：清洁牙齿，减少牙齿得病的机会；促进牙肉组织的血循环，使它增强抵抗牙病的能力。横刷法也能刷净牙齿的外面部分，但却刷不到内面、凹面及牙缝——这正是口腔中最容易藏垢纳污的区域，食物残渣最喜欢躲进去，稍久就会发酵发腐，不仅口臭难闻，而且易成虫牙。横刷法还容易使牙肉受伤。特别是两牙之间的牙肉，比较突出，形成弯曲的弧形，横刷时首当其冲，被牙刷毛来往刺激，常会红肿或出血。
    合理的刷法是顺刷法。在外面部分将牙刷放在牙上，毛尖向着牙肉的一端，由上牙向下刷，下牙向上刷；内面部分，也一样，只是要把牙刷竖起来，才容易刷着；凹面部分，可以左右或来回刷扫。总之，只要顺着牙齿的方向，挑、剔、推、拉各种方法并用，每处刷五、六下，就能刷净牙面牙缝，并能使牙肉受到适当的摩擦。
    最好每次饭后都刷一次牙。办不到时，可在临睡前和起床后各刷一次。还办不到时，至少临睡前刷一次。其他各次，漱漱口也是好的。
