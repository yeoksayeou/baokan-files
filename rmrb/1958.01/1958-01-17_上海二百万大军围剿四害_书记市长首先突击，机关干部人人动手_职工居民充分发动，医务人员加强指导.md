    Shanghai's Two Million Strong Army Besieges the Four Pests
    Party Secretary and Mayor Lead the Charge, All Cadres Participate
    Workers and Residents Fully Mobilized, Medical Personnel Strengthen Guidance
    (Our Dispatch) Shanghai has mobilized over two million people to participate in the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, achieving remarkable results. Many units are now formulating plans to eradicate the four pests.

    In the past half-month, over two million cadres, workers, youth, and residents in Shanghai have plunged into the winter patriotic health campaign, participating in killing fly pupae, overturning vats and jars, eliminating stagnant water, dredging ditches, improving environmental sanitation, exterminating rats, catching sparrows, and various publicity efforts. In Changning District, fourteen units have guaranteed that they will basically eliminate flies this year, with some guaranteeing to achieve "four withouts" (no flies, no mosquitoes, no rats, no sparrows). Sixli Township and Yanqiao Township in the East Suburbs took the lead in proposing a challenge to eliminate flies within a year and to compete in "three comparisons" (comparing determination, plans, and actions), which was echoed by all townships in the district. Jinqiao Township also guaranteed to basically eliminate malaria within a year. Regarding industries prone to breeding the four pests, the waste product company has planned to merge and relocate its 111 units dealing with hides, bones, and rendering to the suburbs within six months. The Milk Company has also planned to improve the management of manure, stagnant water, cowsheds, and feed in its more than 130 pastures, fully integrating pest control with protecting dairy cows and increasing milk production. Vegetable companies, food supply stations, poultry and egg companies, and their affiliated starch factories, vegetable processing plants, and poultry and livestock farms have universally conducted surprise attacks led by leaders to eliminate fly pupae and thoroughly clean up environmental sanitation, and have made plans to improve hygiene measures from equipment and production operations. The improvement of environmental hygiene in these industries will not only prevent the breeding of flies and mosquitoes, providing a strong guarantee for the city's eradication of the four pests, but also greatly benefit the development of production.
    Shanghai's patriotic health campaign, centered on eliminating the four pests, has the following characteristics: First, through rectification, the past practice of convening meetings at all levels to mobilize and deploy the patriotic health campaign has been changed. Instead, responsible comrades of the Municipal People's Committee used telephone conferences to deploy to the leaders of various districts and departments. The next day, the Municipal Party Secretary, ministers, and vice mayors led one hundred assault teams composed of over a thousand cadres each, and went deep into thirty-eight units to carry out surprise activities such as digging pupae, clearing cow dung, and dredging stinking ditches. This method not only eliminated a series of mobilization meetings, but also immediately drove cadres and workers in various districts and departments to take the lead in surprise attacks, thereby smoothly mobilizing the masses. Second, this hygiene campaign has come with great momentum, strong drive, and clear goals. Through the rectification movement, cadres have realized that the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests is one of the important guarantees for the great leap forward in production. Most districts take advantage of the "no-meeting day" every Thursday to go deep into the grassroots to eliminate the four pests, and some have changed the voluntary labor on Sundays to eliminating the four pests, fundamentally reversing the past phenomenon of government agencies and schools lagging behind the masses. In the short span of half a month, almost all of the more than 200,000 cadres have plunged into this struggle. Third, the city's medical and health forces have been mobilized, improving the quality of the pest control work. In addition to personnel from municipal and district health and epidemic prevention, environmental hygiene, and other departments who have undertaken the organizational guidance of pest control work, various districts have also universally conducted training in pest control knowledge for doctors, nurses, midwives, and other personnel from medical clinics and other health care institutions, and are responsible for providing technical guidance for pest control in their designated medical areas. Currently, more than half of the city's 10,000 medical and health personnel have participated in the training. Fourth, the transfer of cadres to lower levels has strengthened the leadership of pest control. Ministers, secretaries, and section chiefs of the party and government departments at the municipal and district levels, after being transferred to lower levels, brought with them the revolutionary drive of the great leap forward in production and the drive to eliminate the four pests.

    上海二百万大军围剿四害
    书记市长首先突击，机关干部人人动手
    职工居民充分发动，医务人员加强指导
    本报讯　上海市已有二百多万人投入以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，取得了辉煌战果。目前许多单位已订出消灭四害的规划。
    半个多月以来，上海市已有二百多万机关干部、职工、青少年和广大居民投入到冬季爱国卫生运动，参加了灭蝇蛹、翻缸罐、除积水、疏浚沟洫、改善环境卫生、灭鼠、捕雀和各项宣传工作。长宁区已有十四个单位保证在今年做到基本消灭苍蝇，有的保证做到“四无”。东郊区六里乡和严桥乡首先提出了一年内消灭苍蝇和三比（比决心、比计划、比行动）的挑战，得到全区各乡镇的响应。金桥乡还保证在一年内做到基本消灭疟疾。在各个孳生四害行业方面，废品公司已作出半年内将一百十一家毛骨、熬油作合并迁郊的规划。牛奶公司也已作出了所属一百三十多个牧场改善畜粪、积水、牛舍、饲料管理的规划，把除四害和保护奶牛、提高产奶量完全结合起来。蔬菜公司、食品供应站、禽类、蛋品公司等单位所属淀粉厂、蔬菜加工厂、禽兽饲养厂等，都普遍由领导带头突击消灭蝇蛹和彻底打扫了环境卫生，并且作出从设备上、生产操作上改进卫生措施的计划。这些行业环境卫生的改进，不但可以防止蝇、蚊孳生，为全市消灭四害提供了有力保证，而且将大大有利于生产的发展。
    上海市这次以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动有以下几个特点：第一，通过整风，改变了过去一开展爱国卫生运动就必须层层开会动员布置的惯例，改为由市人民委员会负责同志用电话会议向各区各部门领导布置；第二天，市委书记、部长和副市长们即分别率领了一千多干部组成的一百个突击队，深入到三十八个单位进行挖蛹、清除牛粪、疏通臭水沟等突击活动。这一方式，不仅省去了一系列的会议动员，而且立即带动了各区、各部门干部、职工纷纷带头突击，从而也顺利地发动了群众。第二，这次卫生运动来势猛、劲头大，目标也很明确。通过整风运动，机关干部都体会到以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动是生产大跃进的重要保证之一。各区大多利用每周星期四“无会议日”深入基层除四害，有的把星期日的义务劳动也改为除四害，根本扭转了过去机关、学校落后于群众的现象。在短短的半个多月中，二十多万干部差不多人人都投入了这一斗争。第三，动员了全市医务卫生力量，提高了除四害工作的质量。除了市、区卫生防疫、环境卫生等部门人员已担负了除四害组织指导工作外，还由各区普遍对医疗门诊和其他保健机构医生、护士、助产士等进行了除四害业务知识的学习，按划区医疗负责地段担任除四害技术指导。目前全市一万多个医务卫生人员已有半数以上参加了学习。第四，干部下放对除四害的领导加强了。市、区的党、政各部门的部长、书记和处、科长们下放后，带去了生产大跃进的革命干劲，也带去了除四害的劲头。
