Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Soviet Union's Second Satellite Will Be Able to Exist in the Air for More Than Half a Year
    According to TASS, Kukarkin, Vice-Chairman of the Astronomical Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, told reporters: "The Soviet Union's second artificial earth satellite will exist for a long period—possibly half a year or a little more." The orbit of the second satellite is different from that of the first. Its characteristic is that the distance from the Earth's surface at its apogee is much greater than that of the first satellite. This makes the shape of the second satellite's orbit around the Earth much longer. The second satellite can be in the less dense atmosphere of the Earth for a long time. Therefore, the change in its orbit and its speed of approaching the Earth's surface are much smaller than those of the first satellite.

    苏联第二个卫星
    能在空中存在半年多
    据新华社讯　苏联科学院天文学委员会副主席库卡尔金对塔斯社记者说：“苏联第二个人造地球卫星将存在一段很长期间——可能是半年或者半年多一点”。第二个卫星的轨道，不同于第一个卫星，它的特点是，在远地点时距地球表面的距离比第一个卫星大得多。这样就使得第二个卫星围绕地球运行的轨道形状要长得多，第二个卫星可以有很长一段时间处在密度较大的地球大气层以外。因此，它的轨道的变化和它接近地球表面的速度比第一个卫星小得多。
