Acheson's One Gain

    Former U.S. Secretary of State Acheson said in a recently published book that what people under different systems produce may be the key to determining the future. Therefore, he expressed concern about the fact that "the rate of U.S. productivity growth is declining." He believes that there is a need to establish a "workable and functioning non-communist world system," otherwise "a most fundamental shift in the balance of power will certainly occur." But he pointed out: "Unless the United States brings actual American life closer to what it proclaims, American preaching alone cannot accomplish this task."
    Indeed, the decline in the rate of productivity growth cannot be saved by myths about American economic prosperity. A "workable and functioning non-communist world system" cannot be established by boasting about the "free world." As a former Secretary of State, Acheson has the most extensive experience with American false propaganda and "preaching." Such a conclusion of his can be considered a gain.

    艾奇逊一得
    前美国国务卿艾奇逊在新近出版的一本书中说，不同制度下的人民所作出来的东西可能是决定前途的关键。因此他对“美国生产力发展的速度正在日益衰退”这个事实表示忧虑。他认为需要建立一个“行得通和起作用的非共产主义世界体系”否则“力量的对比的一个最根本的变化就一定会发生”。但是他指出：“除非美国使实际的美国生活和它所标榜的东西更加接近，光靠美国的说教是不能完成这一任务的。”
    的确，生产力发展速度的衰退，不是关于美国经济繁荣的神话所能挽回的。“行得通和起作用的非共产主义世界体系”也不是关于“自由世界”的吹嘘所能建立的。作为前任国务卿，艾奇逊对美国的虚假宣传和“说教”有最丰富的经验。他的这样一个结论可算是一得。
