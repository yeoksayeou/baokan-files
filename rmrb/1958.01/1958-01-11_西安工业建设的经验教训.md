    Experiences and Lessons of Industrial Construction in Xi'an
    By our reporter Lǐ Qiàn
    During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the large-scale industrial construction in the Xi'an area rapidly changed the face of this ancient city. Five years ago, the banks of the Chan River were still a barren wilderness, but now many modern machine factories, textile factories, optical instrument factories, printing and dyeing factories, and power plants have emerged. On the site of the ancient Han Dynasty city, four modern electrical factories have been established; near these four factories are also located China's largest instrument factory and several large machinery factories. Through these years of construction, tens of thousands of workers have learned the technology of building new factories, enabling many factories to be completed ahead of schedule. Many new types of industries that China did not have in the past have appeared here, and many products that could not be produced in the past are now being produced in these factories! The broad masses of the people have been inspired by such tremendous construction achievements.
    The scale of these new factories is quite large. The designs of the production sections of these factories are advanced, and some of the designs also incorporate the latest scientific research results from fraternal countries. Therefore, after the completion of many factories, they will create very favorable conditions for China to develop similar industries. For example, the completion of China's largest thermal instrument factory—Xi'an Instrument Factory—is of great significance for improving China's industrial technology level and developing scientific research work, and will lay the foundation for the development of China's precision instrument manufacturing industry. Because the designed scale of each new factory is large and the most advanced technology is adopted, the production potential is very large. After fully mobilizing the workers' production enthusiasm, many factories can do the work of two factories with just one. As a result, some similar factories that were planned to be built during the Second Five-Year Plan can be eliminated. This is effectively accelerating the construction progress.
    The achievements of industrial construction in the Xi'an area are very significant. However, due to our lack of construction experience, some shortcomings have also occurred in the construction over the past five years. These shortcomings are mainly manifested in the fact that the determination of construction projects and building standards was not sufficiently combined with China's national conditions, and the spirit of building the country through diligence and frugality was not sufficiently implemented, resulting in more money being spent and some construction funds being wasted. Everyone should learn from these lessons so as to better carry out future construction.
    According to relevant inspections, a relatively important shortcoming in the past industrial construction in the Xi'an area is that many factories were not built in accordance with the spirit of collaboration. Many factories are very close to each other, even separated by only a wall or a road, but they all have their own tool, machine repair, carpentry, and civil engineering repair workshops, each with dozens to hundreds of machines. The utilization rate of these machines is generally very low, and there is also a lot of waste of manpower. If factories were built in collaboration, it would save a great deal. For example, three adjacent machinery factories each have their own tool, machine repair, and electrical repair workshops. If these three factories cooperated in production, the tool workshop could save 149 pieces of equipment, the machine repair workshop could save 64 pieces, and the electrical repair workshop could save 32 pieces. This item alone could save 4.42 million yuan.
    Some newly built factories have also not paid attention to cooperation with local areas. For example, two newly built machinery factories mainly rely on dedicated railway lines for transportation, and each factory has only a dozen or so cars. Near the factories, there are also two local automobile repair and parts factories. However, these two factories have also set up a well-equipped automobile repair section, with more than 20 new machines, worth 150,000 yuan.
    There is also insufficient cooperation between workshops in some factories. These factories all have machine repair workshops, and each production workshop also has a machine repair section, and even the machine repair workshop also has a machine repair section, which increases equipment and building area. For example, the main machines in a factory's forging workshop number only nine, but it has a machine repair section with eight machines. In fact, it is entirely possible to assign the repair tasks of these machines to the machine repair workshop.
    Another shortcoming in the past industrial construction in Xi'an is that the building standards of many factories are too high.
    The safety factor in the construction of production sections of some factories is too high, and the building area is too large. For example, according to the climate in the Xi'an area, the cold-proof and heat-insulating facilities should be designed according to about minus 10 degrees Celsius, but some factories are designed according to minus 18 to 20 degrees Celsius, and individual buildings are even designed according to minus 30 degrees Celsius. In some factory buildings, there are many small factory buildings inside large factory buildings, used as tool warehouses, material warehouses, finished product warehouses, etc. These auxiliary areas generally account for 20% of the total factory building area. If the process layout is appropriately improved, most of the auxiliary area can be moved out of the large factory building, which can greatly save construction funds. According to the statistics of a machinery factory, if only the process layout of the No. 1 and No. 2 main factory buildings is modified, more than 2,000 square meters of building area can be saved. If lean-to structures of the same area are built near the large factory building, 120,000 yuan can also be saved.
    The standards of factory walls, roads and other auxiliary buildings in some factories are also too high. For example, the waste recycling warehouses of some machinery factories are all reinforced concrete structures, and the iron filings are concrete floors; the roads in many factories are designed according to the standards of international highway secondary road surfaces; from the perspective of production requirements, many do not need such high standards. The road shoulders and surfaces of one factory adopt the international highway standard for more than 1,000 vehicles per day, but the actual transportation volume of this factory does not even reach one-tenth of this amount.
    The office buildings, employee dormitories, and living rooms of many newly built factories are also grand and magnificent. The cost of office buildings generally exceeds the state regulations by 20% to 45%. The cost of one factory's office building is as high as 326 yuan per square meter. The lighting standards in some offices are also too high. An office of 24 square meters has two 400-watt electric lights and four sockets. The electric lights in some cloakrooms are even more surprisingly numerous. In a room of 130 square meters, there are 34 60-watt electric lights. Most of the employee dormitories in the Northwest State Cotton Factory No. 4 have magnesite floors, and the cost of family dormitories is as high as more than 101 yuan per square meter; some machinery factories also have hardwood floor employee dormitories. The cost of living rooms in many factories is even higher than that of office buildings. The building area of some living rooms is too large. The living room of the No. 2 factory building of one factory has a three-story building, with a total of 68 rooms including the basement, including 6 toilets, 1 washroom, 9 cloakrooms, 2 shower rooms, 8 changing rooms, 4 dining rooms, and 1 small store, which accounts for 42.7% of the total area.
    In addition, due to lack of experience in the past, these newly built factories generally did not purchase and install equipment in phases according to the production plan, but purchased and installed it all at once during the construction of the factory. However, the tool repair departments of newly built factories do not have much work, which also prevents some large-scale special equipment from being fully utilized.
    The construction of so many good factories with new equipment and advanced technology in the Xi'an area in a short period of time has greatly increased the country's production capacity, and the achievements are tremendous. Although some shortcomings have occurred and some money has been spent, most of these shortcomings were caused by insufficient construction experience, and many shortcomings were unavoidable. Through summarizing the factory construction work during the First Five-Year Plan period, many experiences and lessons can be learned. With these experiences, there is no doubt that we will build the same or more and better industrial enterprises with less money in the future.

    西安工业建设的经验教训
    本报记者　李茜
    在第一个五年计划期间，西安地区规模巨大的工业建设迅速地改变了这座古城的面貌。五年前还是一片空旷原野的浐河沿岸，现在已经出现了许多现代化的机器厂、纺织厂、光学仪器厂、印染厂和发电厂。在古汉城的遗址上，四个现代化的电工厂建立起来了；在这四个厂附近，还有我国最大的仪表厂和几个大型机器厂。通过这几年的建设，成千上万的职工学会了建设新型工厂的技术，使许多工厂提前建成。很多过去我国没有的新型工业在这里出现了，很多过去不能生产的产品在这些工厂里生产出来了！广大人民都被这样巨大的建设成就所鼓舞。
    这些新建工厂的规模都相当大。这些厂的生产部分的设计都是先进的，有些厂的设计还采用了兄弟国家最新的科学研究成果。因此，许多厂建成以后，将为我国发展同类型的工业创造十分有利的条件。例如，我国最大的热工仪表厂——西安仪表厂建成以后，对提高我国工业技术水平和发展科学研究工作有很大的意义，并且将为我国精密仪表制造业的发展奠定基础。由于各新建厂的设计规模大，并且采用了最先进的技术，所以生产潜力都很大。许多厂在充分发挥起工人的生产积极性后，一个就可顶两个用。这样一来，一些准备在第二个五年计划期间建设的同类型工厂就可不再建了。这实际上等于提前了建设进度。
    西安地区工业建设的成绩是十分巨大的。但是，由于我们的建设经验还不足，过去五年的建设中也发生过一些缺点。这些缺点主要表现在：确定建设项目和建筑标准时结合我国的国情不够，贯彻勤俭建国的精神不够，因而多花了些钱，浪费了一部分建设资金。大家应该很好地吸取这些教训，以便更好地进行今后的建设。
    根据有关方面检查，西安地区过去工业建设中的一个比较重要的缺点，是不少工厂没有很好地按照协作的精神建厂。有许多工厂相距很近，甚至只隔一堵墙或者一条马路，但是也都分别设有工具、机修、木工、土建修理等车间，每个车间都有机器数十台至数百台。这些机器的利用率一般都很低，人力上也有不少浪费。如果协作建厂就会大为节省。例如，有三个相邻的机器厂都各自设有工具、机修和电修车间。如果这三个厂进行协作生产，工具车间可以节约设备一百四十九台，机修车间可以节约六十四台，电修车间可以节约三十二台，只这一项就可以节约四百四十二万元。
    有些新建工厂也没有注意同地方上协作。例如有两个新建的机器厂，主要运输是靠铁路专用线，每个厂只有十几辆汽车，工厂附近还有两个地方上的汽车修配厂。但是，这两个厂又都搞了一个设备齐全的汽车修理工段，设有二十多台新机器，价值十五万元。
    有些厂车间同车间之间协作也不够。这些厂都有机修车间，每个生产车间又设有机修工段，甚至在机修车间内也设有机修工段，因此就增加了设备和建筑面积。例如有一个厂的锻压车间的主要机器只有九台，却设有一个拥有八台机器的机修工段，其实把这几台机器的检修任务放到机修车间是完全可以的。
    西安过去工业建设中的另一个缺点，是不少工厂建筑标准偏高。
    有些厂生产部分的建设安全系数偏高，建筑面积偏大。例如，按照西安地区的气候，防寒保温设施按照零下十度左右设计就可以，但是有的厂是按零下十八度至二十度设计的，个别建筑甚至是按零下三十度设计的。有些厂房，大厂房里套有很多小厂房，用作工具库、材料库、成品仓库等，这些辅助面积一般占厂房总面积的20％。如果适当改善工艺布置，大部分辅助面积都可以搬出大厂房，这样可以大大节省建设资金。据一个机器厂统计，仅一、二号主厂房如果修改工艺布置，就可以节约二千多平方公尺的建筑面积。如果在大厂房附近建同样面积的披屋，还可以节约十二万元。
    有些工厂围墙、道路和其他辅助建筑物的标准过高。例如，有些机器厂的废料回收库全是钢筋混凝土结构，铁屑混凝土地坪；许多厂的道路都是按照国际公路二级路面的标准设计的；从生产要求来看，很多都不需要有这么高的标准。有一个厂的路牙路面都采用的每天行车一千辆以上的国际公路标准，实际上这个厂的运输量还达不到这个数量的十分之一。
    许多新建厂的办公楼、职工宿舍和生活间的建筑也是规模宏大、富丽堂皇。办公楼造价普遍超过国家规定20％到45％。有一个厂办公楼的造价竟高达每平方公尺三百二十六元。有些办公室的照明标准也过高了。一间二十四平方公尺的办公室，设有两盏四百支光的电灯，另外还有四个插座。有的挂衣室的电灯更是多得出奇，在一百三十平方公尺的房子里，竟设有三十四盏六十支光的电灯。西北国棉四厂的职工宿舍大部分是菱苦土地坪，家属宿舍的造价一平方公尺高达一百零一元以上；有些机器厂还有硬木地板的职工宿舍。不少厂生活间的造价比办公楼还要高。有些生活间的建筑面积过大。有一个厂的二号厂房的生活间有三层楼房，连地下室共有房子六十八间，其中厕所六间，盥洗室一间，衣帽间九间，淋浴室二间，更衣室八间，餐室四间，小卖部一间，以上共占总面积的42.7％。
    另外，由于过去没有经验，这些新建工厂一般都不是按生产计划分期购买和安装设备，而是在建厂时一次购置和安装起来。但是，刚刚建成的工厂，工具修理部门都没有多少工作，这也使一些大型的专用设备不能充分发挥作用。
    西安地区在短短的几年时间内，建设起这么多这么好的拥有新型设备和先进技术的工厂，为国家增加了相当雄厚的生产能力，成绩是巨大的。虽然也发生过一些缺点，多花了一些钱，但是这些缺点绝大部分是由于建设经验不足所造成的，而且许多缺点是不可避免的。通过对第一个五年计划期间建厂工作的总结，可以取得很多经验教训。有了这些经验，今后无疑地会用较少的钱建设同样的或者更多更好的工业企业。
