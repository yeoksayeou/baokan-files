There are No Insurmountable Difficulties
Editor

In the current winter production campaign, there are two urgent problems that need to be solved: one is how to solve the labor shortage so that water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, and sideline industries can all be done well; the other is how to speed up the progress of water conservancy construction, so that many projects are completed before the Spring Festival, so as not to hinder the sowing of early-maturing crops. Faced with these difficulties, some people feel that the tasks are too many and too heavy, and want to reduce some of them. Some people try every means to overcome difficulties, not only not shrinking back, but also wanting to move forward faster.

Paoma Township in Dangyang County, Hubei Province, also once encountered the difficulty of insufficient labor. However, they adopted a positive approach, mobilizing the masses to improve tools, and in a short period of time, a new situation emerged in water conservancy construction: heavy physical labor was eliminated, and replaced by various new tools created by the masses, pulled by cattle or pushed by people. This greatly eased the situation of labor shortage. When people visited here, they saw "carts like flowing water and horses like dragons." Tools commonly used for thousands of years, such as carrying poles, have already "retired." This is a great initiative of the masses and a manifestation of collective wisdom.

Yichang Prefecture promoted the experience of Paoma Township, and many agricultural cooperatives realized "cartization," overcoming the difficulty of labor shortage; winter production was fully launched.

The fact that difficulties contain the factors to overcome them, and that overcoming difficulties is the driving force for progress, has been vividly and powerfully demonstrated here. Isn't it precisely difficulties that have forced people to move forward and get rid of the primitive carrying pole? Isn't it precisely the effort to overcome difficulties that has made all kinds of production better developed? What plays a decisive role here is what attitude is adopted towards difficulties.

When the leading cadres of Paoma Township first encountered difficulties, they adopted a method of turning their backs on the masses, and a few people shut themselves up and discussed it, but they failed to come up with a good solution. However, they did not retreat from this, and were not intimidated by the difficulties. They finally found a way: turning around to face the masses, telling the masses about the difficulties, and mobilizing everyone to think of solutions. Sure enough, after an organized debate, the masses realized: if the contradiction between water conservancy construction and other production is not resolved, what impact will it have on the production of the cooperative and their own lives? The solutions were put forward one by one, and the enthusiasm was generally increased. From this, it can be seen that in front of our revolutionaries, there are indeed no difficulties that cannot be overcome. We have a wonderful way to solve all difficulties, and that is: face the masses, go deep into the masses, and rely on the masses.

Many people often frown and show a "no way" attitude when faced with new tasks. The reason is mostly that they have not seen the broad masses, do not believe in the principle of the masses liberating themselves, and do not understand that history is created by the masses. In their minds, they have separated the work of revolution from the interests of the masses. In this way, they always turn their backs on the masses and shout difficulties to the sky. After reading the deeds of Paoma Township, one should be awakened!

    没有克服不了的困难
    编者
    在当前的冬季生产运动中，有两个迫切需要解决的问题：一个是如何解决劳力不足的困难，以便使水利、积肥、造林和副业等项工作全都做好；一个如何加快水利建设的进度，使许多工程最好在春节以前完工，以免妨碍早熟作物播种。在这些困难面前，有些人觉得任务太多太重了，想要减去一些。有些人却千方百计设法战胜困难，不但不退缩，而且要更快地前进。
    湖北当阳县跑马乡也曾经发生劳力不够用的困难。但是他们采取了积极的办法，发动群众改进工具，在很短的期间就使兴修水利的工作出现了崭新的局面：繁重的体力劳动消除了，代之而起的是牛拉的或人推的各式各样的群众创造的新工具。大大缓和了劳动力不足的形势。人们在这里参观的时候，但见“车如流水马如龙”。几千年常用的扁担之类的工具，已经“告老还乡”了。这是群众的伟大的创举，是集体的智慧的表现。
    宜昌专区推广了跑马乡的经验，许多农业社实现了“车子化”，劳力不足的困难克服了；冬季生产全面地开展起来了。
    在困难中就包含着克服困难的因素，克服困难正是进步的动力，在这里又得到了生动有力的证明。不正是困难迫使人们前进，摆脱了原始的扁担吗？不正是克服困难的努力使各项生产都更好地开展起来了吗？在这里起决定作用的，是对待困难采取什么态度。
    跑马乡的领导干部在最初碰到困难的时候，曾采取背向群众的方式，几个人关起门来商量来商量去，终究没有讨论出一个好办法。不过，他们并没有从此退却，没有被困难吓倒。他们终于找出来了一条路：掉转身来面向群众，把困难告诉群众，发动大家想办法。果然，有领导地开展辩论之后，群众认清了：兴修水利和搞其他生产的矛盾不解决，对社里的生产和自己的生活会发生什么样的影响，办法就一一提出来了，干劲就普遍增高了。由此可见，在我们革命者面前，的确没有什么真正克服不了的困难。我们有解决一切困难的妙法，这就是：面向群众，深入群众，依靠群众。
    有许多人在新的任务面前，常常愁眉苦脸，表现出“没有办法”的样子。原因多半是他们没有看见广大群众，不相信群众自己解放自己的道理，不懂得历史正是群众创造的。在他们的脑子里，把革命的工作同群众的利益分割开来了。这样，他们便老是背对着群众，望着天空高声叫喊困难。看了跑马乡的事迹，应当猛省！
