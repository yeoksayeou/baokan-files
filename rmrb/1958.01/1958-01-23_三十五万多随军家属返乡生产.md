Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd – The work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army units in mobilizing the dependents of military personnel to return to their hometowns for production has achieved significant results. According to incomplete statistics, as of mid-January, more than 353,100 dependents of military personnel throughout the army have left the units and returned to the agricultural production front in their hometowns.

In recent times, the work of mobilizing dependents of military personnel to return to their hometowns for production has progressed particularly rapidly. The vast majority of dependents of military personnel are striving to leave the teams and return to their hometowns before the Spring Festival, in order to settle down as soon as possible and quickly engage in spring plowing production. In the Beijing area, the number of dependents of military personnel who have already returned to their hometowns accounts for nearly 80% of the total number of dependents of military personnel who should return to their hometowns. Most of those who have not left will basically leave before the Spring Festival. More than 70% of the dependents of military personnel stationed in Jinan, Fuzhou, and other places, as well as the Railway Corps and the Armored Corps, have returned to their hometowns. As of mid-January, the number of people returning to their hometowns from the Guangzhou garrison had increased fourfold compared to a month and a half ago. In the past half month, an average of more than 1,300 dependents of military personnel stationed in Shenyang have set off to return to their hometowns every day. The dependents of officers stationed in the front-line islands and forward areas of Fujian have basically all left the team to return to their hometowns for production, except for a few with special difficulties.

In the work of mobilizing the dependents of military personnel to return to their hometowns for production, the Party committees and military and political leaders at all levels of the troops have given the officers' dependents great care and assistance with a caring attitude and a responsible spirit, both ideologically and materially. Before the dependents left the team, many units fully mobilized the masses, carried out meticulous and in-depth ideological education and organizational arrangements. Some unit leaders also helped the returning dependents formulate resettlement and production plans, and encouraged them to actively participate in the rural mass production movement after returning to their hometowns, and contribute to promoting the great leap forward in agricultural production. When the dependents returned to their hometowns, many troops held warm farewell meetings, adorning the returning dependents with red flowers, giving speeches and presenting gifts. In order to ensure the smooth journey of the returning dependents, the troops in Fuzhou, Nanjing, Jinan, Guangzhou, Kunming and other regions also sent special personnel to set up service groups, reception groups or inquiry stations at the junction points of railways, highways or ports in Nanping, Shanghai, Xuzhou, Jinan, Yantai, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Kunming, Guiyang, etc., to assist passing officers' dependents in solving problems such as transferring trains, buying tickets, sending luggage, temporary accommodation and medical treatment for illness. For the returning dependents with many children, long distances, and inconvenient journeys, many troops sent special personnel or approved the officers themselves to escort them home.

The broad masses of officers and their dependents in the army enthusiastically supported the measures to mobilize the dependents to return to their hometowns for production with extremely high political enthusiasm. They believe that in the period when the country is tapping all its potential for socialist construction, the arrangement of personal life should first obey the needs of the country. Everyone should serve the motherland in different positions, so that their lives are full of rich content, and should never covet personal comfort and enjoyment. Therefore, they bid farewell to each other happily. After the dependents of military personnel returned to their hometowns, the officers concentrated more on their work and study, and spent more time going deep into the company and mixing with the soldiers. The dependents also enthusiastically devoted themselves to the winter mass production movements such as water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, and constantly wrote letters to their relatives, challenging each other and encouraging each other to move forward together.

    三十五万多随军家属返乡生产
    新华社22日讯　中国人民解放军各部队动员随军家属还乡生产的工作已经取得重大成绩。据不完全统计，到本月中旬止，全军已有三十五万三千一百多名随军家属离开部队，回到家乡农业生产战线。
    最近时期以来，各部队动员家属还乡生产的工作进展特别快，绝大部分随军家属都尽量争取在春节前离队还乡，以便及早安好家，迅速投入春耕生产。北京地区部队目前已经还乡的家属已占应该还乡家属总户数近80％，部分未走的也将在春节前基本上走完。济南、福州等地驻军和铁道兵、装甲兵的随军家属，70％以上的人已经回到了家乡。广州驻军到本月中旬，还乡人数比一个多月前增加了四倍。沈阳驻军最近半个月内，平均每天都有一千三百多名随军家属启程还乡。福建前线驻海岛和前沿地区部队的军官家属，除个别有特殊困难的未走外，已经基本上全部离队返乡生产。
    在动员随军家属还乡生产工作中，部队各级党委和军政首长都以爱护的态度，负责的精神，从思想上到生活上给了军官家属以极大的关怀和帮助。不少单位在家属离队前都充分发动群众，进行了细致、深入的思想教育工作和组织安排，有的单位首长还帮助还乡家属订立了安家生产计划，并且鼓励他们回乡后要积极投入农村大生产运动，为促进农业生产大跃进贡献自己的力量。家属还乡时，许多部队都召开了热烈的欢送大会，为还乡家属披红戴花，赠言献礼。福州、南京、济南、广州、昆明等地区部队为使还乡家属旅途顺利，还在南平、上海、徐州、济南、烟台、青岛、广州、昆明、贵阳等铁道、公路或港口的联结点，派专人设置了服务组、招待组或问询站，协助过路军官家属解决转车、买票、寄运行李、临时住宿和生病治疗等问题。对于孩子多，路途远，旅途不便的还乡家属，许多部队都派专人或批准军官本人护送到家。
    部队广大军官和他们的家属以极高的政治热情，热烈拥护动员家属还乡生产的措施。他们认为，在国家挖掘一切潜力进行社会主义建设的时期，个人生活的安排应该首先服从国家的需要。每一个人都应该在不同岗位上为祖国服务，使自己的生活充满丰富的内容，绝不该贪图个人的安逸和享受。因此，他们都心情愉快地互相话别。在随军家属回乡后，军官们更加集中精力地进行工作和学习了，深入连队和士兵打成一片的时间也增多了；家属们也干劲十足地投入了兴修水利和积肥等冬季大生产运动，并且不断写信给自己的亲人，互相挑战，共勉前进。
