Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th: If more than 50 small and medium-sized automobile parts and component factories in Shanghai fully utilize their cooperative production capabilities, they can produce 1,200 three-wheeled automobiles annually without building new factories, expanding existing ones, or increasing the number of workers.

The "Three-Wheeled Automobile Office," established by the Shanghai Internal Combustion Engine Parts Manufacturing Company to trial-produce China's first three-wheeled automobile, recently summarized its trial-production experience and formulated a plan. The task arranged for this year is to manufacture 500 three-wheeled automobiles of two models; the goal of producing 1,200 vehicles annually is projected to be achieved in two to three years.

Three-wheeled automobile production has already begun in batches in Shanghai.

This year, there are also plans to trial-produce small cars. In this way, this industry, composed almost entirely of small factories, will leap from repair and assembly to manufacturing.

    年产一千二百辆三轮汽车
    据新华社上海30日电上海五十多家中小型汽车配件、零件工厂，如果充分发挥协作生产的作用，可以在不建新厂、不扩建、不增加工人的条件下，年产一千二百辆三轮汽车。
    上海市内燃机配件制造公司为试制我国第一辆三轮汽车而设立的“三轮汽车办公室”，最近总结了试制经验，作出了规划。今年安排好的任务，是要制造两种型号的三轮汽车五百辆；年产一千二百辆的目标，预定在两三年后达到。
    现在上海已经开始成批生产三轮汽车。
    今年还计划试制小轿车。这样，这个几乎全是小型工厂组成的行业，就将从修配跃进到制造。
