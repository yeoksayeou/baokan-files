The basic construction projects that were planned to be put into production last year, such as Bulgaria's first iron-smelting furnace, phosphate fertilizer plant, and flotation beneficiation plant, have all been put into production. Coal production has fully met the needs of the national economy and residents, and rich underground coal deposits have also been discovered.

When talking about this year's heavy industry development plan, Tsolov pointed out that the total output of heavy industry this year will increase by 15.8% compared to last year, of which coal production will reach more than 12 million tons, iron - 81,000 tons, steel - 204,000 tons, chemical fertilizers - 259,000 tons, radios - 13,400 units, hanging-type grain harvesting combine harvesters - 1,300 units, motorcycles - 3,510 units, and bicycles - 30,000 units.

The total investment in basic construction by the Ministry of Heavy Industry this year is 1.253 billion leva, more than half of which will be used for mining, metallurgy, and coal mining industries. This year's investment can guarantee the construction of 145 heavy industry projects and partial construction of more than 100 projects. More than 70% of the basic construction funds will come from the growth of existing enterprises' production.
