Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 31st: “What scientific discoveries will be made in 1958?” This was an appealing question that TASS reporters posed to several Soviet scientists on New Year's Eve. The scientists responded with exciting predictions.

    Soviet Doctor of Technical Sciences, Stanyukovich, said: Overcoming Earth's gravity with rockets is not the only possible path. A second path to conquering the universe is now being planned, namely, flying into space aboard a gravity machine (a device not affected by Earth's gravity). I predict that in 1958, there will be some clarification on the problem of gravity. The unveiling of this mystery of nature will endow humanity with unparalleled power. The task facing scientists is to provide a correct explanation of the origin of the solar system based on the laws of gas movement in outer space. The key to solving this problem is gas kinematics and gas dynamics. It has been hypothesized that the entire solar system was formed from a cloud of gas, whose particles gradually diffused due to different speeds of movement. Slower particles remained in the center of the solar system. They formed a nucleus, in which conditions favorable for thermonuclear reactions and the emergence of the sun were created. Faster molecules moved in orbits, concentrating to become planets. In 1958, Soviet scientists will carefully study this hypothesis.

    Soviet physicist Landau said: The new year may be a year of major discoveries in the most important branch of modern physics—elementary particle physics. There are still many blank spots in this area. Solving them is very important for correctly understanding the world around us.

    The latest discoveries regarding the weak interactions between elementary particles have presented physicists with a broader and more difficult task: it is necessary to thoroughly reconsider the concept of the general nature of spatial symmetry.

    In 1958, a correct theoretical concept must be found for the contradictory phenomena that occur during the β-decay of atomic nuclei, and the issue of the neutrino, the smallest of the known elementary particles, must be clarified. It is possible that we are facing new important discoveries in this attractive area. The operation of the world's largest synchrophasotron at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, a city near Moscow, heralds the great prospects of the coming year. The work carried out by this accelerator is entirely possible to discover new elementary particles and antiparticles that could not be discovered before due to insufficient accelerator power.

    Physicist and Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Ginzburg, said: There are realistic grounds to expect that in the new year of 1958, major achievements can be made in at least two extremely important scientific fields: First, it is possible to achieve preliminary major successes in solving the most important problem in world science and technology—controlling thermonuclear reactions. Second, if 1957 laid the foundation for conquering the universe and was distinguished by the launch and flight of artificial earth satellites, then 1958 will be the year when these flights bring the first scientific results. Issues related to the high-level structure of the Earth's atmosphere, primary cosmic rays, and the sun's ultraviolet and X-rays will be resolved.

    In 1958, due to the application of the full power of new, giant radio telescopes (especially those in the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom), further vigorous development of radio astronomy can be expected. Unraveling the mystery of the solar radio radiation process is one of the most urgent tasks in this area. Studying the "radio sound" of the sun will give mankind a key to understanding the essence of the physical processes occurring on the sun.

    Doctor of Geographical Sciences, Captain of the Soviet Antarctic Expedition, Mikhail Somov, said: There is every reason to believe that Soviet Antarctic explorers will reach the uninhabited central regions of Antarctica next year. Science will have more accurate data on the dynamics of Antarctic cold air, which affects not only the climate of the Southern Hemisphere but also the Northern Hemisphere. In 1958, the Soviet expedition will continue to study the thickness of the Antarctic ice sheet in order to work together with scientists from various countries studying Antarctica to solve one of the most important problems in modern geography: Is Antarctica a continent or an archipelago covered by ice?

    一九五八年将有哪些发现？
    苏联科学家作出振奋人心的预测
    据新华社31日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科31日讯：“1958年中将有哪些科学发现？”是塔斯社记者在新年前夕向一些苏联科学家提出的一个吸引人的问题。科学家们以振奋人心的预测作了答复。
    苏联技术科学博士斯塔纽科维奇说：用火箭克服地心引力并不是唯一可能的道路。现在正在计划第二条征服宇宙的道路，即乘坐万有引力机（一种不受地心引力作用的装置）飞向宇宙。我预料，在1958年将对万有引力问题有某些阐明。自然界这个谜的揭示将赋予人类以无比的力量。科学家面临的任务就是要根据气体在宇宙空间运动的规律来对太阳系的起源作出正确的解释。解决这个问题的关键是气体运动学和气体动力学。有人提出这样的假设：整个太阳系是由一块气体云形成的，这块云的粒子由于运动速度不同逐渐扩散。速度慢的粒子留在太阳系的中心。它们形成了核，核中形成了有利于热核反应和出现太阳的条件。速度快的分子在轨道上运动，集中成为行星。1958年，苏联科学家将对这个假设进行仔细研究。
    苏联物理学家兰道说：新的一年可能是在近代物理学最重要的部门——基本粒子物理学方面有重大发现的一年。在这方面目前还有很多空白点。它们的解决对于正确地理解我们周围世界非常重要。
    有关研究基本粒子间弱相互作用的最新发现，向物理学家提出了更为广泛的、更为困难的任务：必须彻底地重新考虑关于空间对称一般性质的概念。
    1958年要对原子核β衰变时所发生的矛盾现象找出一个正确的理论概念，还要弄清楚已知基本粒子中最小的中微子的问题。可能在这个吸引人的方面我们面临着新的重要的发现。位于莫斯科近郊城市杜布诺的国际原子核研究中心的世界最大的同步稳相加速器的运转，预示着就要来到的一年的远大前景，这个加速器所进行的工作，完全有可能发现以前因加速器功率不足而不能发现的新的基本粒子和反粒子。
    物理学家、苏联科学院通讯院士金兹堡说：有现实的根据可以预期，在新的1958年里，至少可在两项极重要的科学部门取得重大成果：第一，有可能在解决世界科学和技术上最重大的问题——控制热核反应的问题上取得初步的重大成就。第二，如果说1957年奠立了征服宇宙的开端并且以人造地球卫星的发射和飞行的事实称著的话，那么1958年就将是这些飞行带来第一批科学成果的一年。有关地球大气高层结构、原始宇宙线、太阳的紫外线和X线等问题将得到解决。
    在1958年，由于新的、巨大的无线电望远镜（特别是苏联和英国的）全部功率的应用，可以预期无线电天文学也将取得进一步蓬勃的发展。解开太阳无线电辐射发生进程之谜是这方面最迫切的任务之一。研究太阳的“无线电声”就将给人类一把认识太阳上发生的物理过程的实质的钥匙。
    地理科学博士、南极综合考察队队长米哈伊尔·索莫夫说：有一切根据相信：苏联南极考察家来年将到达南极的无人到过的中心地区。科学将掌握关于南极冷空气动态的更为准确的材料，南极冷空气不仅对南半球而且对北半球的气候都有影响。苏联考察队1958年将继续研究南极冰层的厚度，以便同研究南极的各国科学家共同努力来解决现代地理的最重要的问题之一：南极是一个大陆呢，还是一个为冰所复盖的群岛。
