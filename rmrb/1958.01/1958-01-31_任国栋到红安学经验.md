Ren Guodong, who won a Golden Star Medal for pioneering a high-yield county, has come to Hong'an County to learn high-yield experience.

Ren Guodong is now the Secretary of the Mudanjiang Prefectural Party Committee. The Heilongjiang Province visiting group he led consisted of 61 people. They stayed in Hong'an for three days, listened to the experience introductions of the county, townships, and cooperatives, and visited the field crops of Minsheng Cooperative in Tianma Township and Jiansu Cooperative in Xinghua Township.

They visited very carefully and asked very diligently. They visited Geng Liangyu's experimental plot in the Chengguan Guidance Group. This plot of land is half an acre, and in 1957 it yielded 850 jin of rice. Half of the rice stubble is still left for people to visit. Everyone took out their notebooks and asked questions while taking notes. Ren Guodong also went down to the field to measure the plant spacing by hand, which was three to four inches. He stood up and said, "Well, in our Northeast, corn is planted two feet apart. If we plant like you, the yield per unit area will undoubtedly increase." He saw a sign inserted next to the experimental field, which stated the land area, planned yield, and technical measures, and was very interested. He said, "This is even more vivid. The surrounding masses will see the model of the cadres' experimental field and will rush to catch up. The points and the surface will be combined."

They saw old brick soil piled in the field and didn't recognize it. Ren Guodong went to the field, grabbed a handful and asked, "What kind of fertilizer is this?" The cooperative director replied, "We are turning out old brick soil to use as fertilizer in conjunction with improving living conditions." He immediately said, "If we turn over the *kang* in our Northeast once a year, we will have more of this than you."

Many women in Hong'an County were weeding the field ridges and carrying pond mud to make fertilizer, working very hard. When Ren Guodong saw this situation, he thought of his own area: "We lack this kind of enthusiasm there." He also turned around and asked a township party branch secretary in the visiting group: "Do you feel motivated when you see this situation?" The branch secretary, who was in his twenties, replied excitedly: "I am motivated, I have confidence!"

On the afternoon of the third day, Cheng Peng, the first secretary of the Hong'an County Party Committee, who was inspecting work in various townships with his mobile office, rushed back from the mountainous area to meet with Ren Guodong. Ren Guodong talked about his five insights from visiting and studying here: First, the enthusiasm from top to bottom is sufficient, the courage is great, and the perseverance is strong, carrying forward the revolutionary tradition of the old Soviet area. Second, the mass line has been implemented from beginning to end, grasping the demands and psychology of the masses in each period, and relying on the masses to promote work. Third, experimental fields have been created creatively, enabling cadres to truly "participate in production and lead production," thereby setting off a mass production upsurge. Fourth, there is a practical "three unification" and "three guarantee" working system (the three unifications are unified leadership, unified work arrangement, and unified use of cadres; the three guarantees are guaranteeing increased production, guaranteeing the transformation of backwardness, and guaranteeing the good work of various departments), which guarantees the mass line and the completion of various tasks. Fifth, "four grasps" are adopted in the work (grasping key points, grasping the overall situation, grasping backwardness, and grasping fresh things), especially grasping fresh things, using advanced people and advanced ideas, and using vivid facts to educate cadres and educate the masses. He said: "Hong'an's experience is a mirror. Compared with our work, we are far behind."

Cheng Peng said: "The Northeast was liberated earlier and has good production, creating a high-yield county as early as 1952, and is an elder brother. Hong'an County is an old Soviet area, which was severely devastated by the reactionaries before liberation. Production and construction began in 1956 and is a younger brother. Although we have achieved some results last year, there are still many shortcomings." He specially organized a county-wide cadre meeting and asked Ren Guodong to introduce his experience in leading production in Zhaoyuan County.

Before parting, they agreed to exchange information and experiences in the future. Ren Guodong sent Hong'an County some "Aomori No. 5" early rice seeds; Cheng Peng also sent the visiting group some peanut seeds and edamame (pig feed) seeds. May the good seeds from the north and south of the motherland bloom and bear fruit everywhere!

    任国栋到红安学经验
    邓庆明
    以首创丰产县而获得金星奖章的任国栋，到红安县学习丰产经验来了。
    任国栋现在是牡丹江地委书记处书记。他这次率领的黑龙江省参观团，共有六十一人，在红安住了三天，听了县、乡、社的经验介绍，并参观了天马乡民胜社和杏花乡建苏社的田间作物。
    他们参观得很仔细，也问得很勤。他们参观了城关指导组耿良瑜的试验田。这块田有半亩，1957年收了水稻八百五十斤，现在还留有一半谷椿供人参观。大家都拿出本子，边问边记。任国栋还下地去用手量株距，是三、四寸。他直起身来说：“咳，咱们东北种玉米是两尺远一棵。要像你们这样种，单位面积产量无疑会提高。”他见试验田边插有牌子，上面写着土地面积，计划产量和技术措施，很感兴趣。他说：“这样就更生动了。周围的群众看见干部试验田有样子比着，都会往前赶。点和面就结合起来了。”
    他们看见地里堆有陈砖土，不认得。任国栋去地里抓起一把问道：“这是什么肥料？”社主任回答说：“我们结合改善居住条件，翻出陈砖土来做肥料。”他马上说：“像这样的肥料，咱们东北的炕一年翻一次，那就会比你们多些。”
    红安县很多妇女这时都在铲除田埂的杂草和挑塘泥做肥料，干的很起劲。任国栋看见这情形，又联想到自己的地区：“我们那里就是缺少这种干劲。”他还回头问参观团的一个乡支部书记：“你看到这种情形，有没有干劲？”这个二十多岁的支部书记很激动地回答说：“我有干劲，有信心！”
    第三天下午，带着他的流动办公室在各乡检查工作的红安县委第一书记程鹏，从山区赶回来同任国栋会见。任国栋谈到他在这里参观学习的五点体会：一是从上到下的干劲足、魄力大、毅力强，发扬了老苏区的革命传统。二是自始至终贯彻了群众路线，抓住了群众每个时期的要求和心理，依靠群众推动了工作。三是创造性的培养了试验田，使干部真正做到“参加生产，领导生产”，进而掀起了群众性的生产高潮。四是有切实可行的“三统”“三包”工作制度（三统是统一领导，统一安排工作，统一使用干部；三包是包增产，包转变落后，包做好各部门工作），保证了走群众路线和完成各项工作。五是工作上采取了“四抓”（抓重点，抓全面，抓落后，抓新鲜事物），特别是抓新鲜事物，用先进人、先进思想，用活生生的事实教育干部、教育群众。他说：“红安的经验是一面镜子。对照我们的工作，我们还差得远。”
    程鹏说：“东北解放早、生产好，在1952年就创造出丰产县，是老大哥。红安县是老苏区，解放前被反动派摧残很厉害，到1956年才进行生产建设，是小兄弟。虽然去年取得些成绩，但缺点还很多。”他特别组织了全县机关干部大会，请任国栋介绍他在肇源县领导生产的经验。
    临别时，他们约定：以后要交换情况，交流经验。任国栋送给红安县一些“青森五号”早稻种籽；程鹏也送给参观团一些花生种籽和毛豆（生猪饲料）种籽。议祖国南北的良种在各地开花结果吧！
