Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 15th. The Xi'an First Aviation Technical School recently proposed a new goal for running the school thriftily. Starting next year, they will rely on the wealth created by students in the internship factory to achieve complete self-sufficiency, no longer asking the state for a single penny; and will still train 300 technical workers for the country every year.

This school will gradually implement specific plans to achieve self-sufficiency, starting this year. The plan stipulates that all students will engage in half-work and half-study. In conjunction with the teaching syllabus, the internship factory will produce 90 lathes, 500 diesel engines, 300 electric motors, and 80 sets of aviation instrument testing equipment, with a total output value of over 2.1 million yuan. In this way, the net profit from this year's internship production, plus the net profit from the past three years of internship production and the value of reserve materials, will accumulate to approximately 1.2 million yuan in working capital by the end of the year, which can basically meet the needs of organizing expanded reproduction starting next year. Next year, the total output value of the internship factory will increase to more than 2.9 million yuan, and the profits obtained from it will enable the school to be self-sufficient in its expenses.

Since its establishment in 1953, this school has consistently adhered to the principle of running the school thriftily. They used the concentration camp houses left over by the Kuomintang as school buildings and set up an internship factory with more than 90 old-fashioned belt-driven lathes. At that time, although other nearby units built many tall buildings, they carried forward the glorious tradition of running businesses frugally in the old liberated areas and did not reach out to the state for money. Teachers and students united as one and trained talents for the country under extremely difficult equipment conditions. Since 1954, they have implemented the principle of "production internship as the main focus" of running the school, gradually undertaking external work, and allowing students to produce valuable products in conjunction with the teaching syllabus. The output value of the internship factory has increased year after year. It increased twentyfold from 1954 to 1956, and increased by more than one-third from 1956 to 1957. During this period, the state's production internship fee for training each student per month was gradually reduced from fifteen yuan to five yuan per year. As a result of this school's arrangement of production internships in conjunction with the teaching syllabus, the technical level improved rapidly. With the help of teachers, students trial-produced more than 100 kinds of new products using dilapidated lathes, and produced more than 20 kinds of aviation instruments.

    西安第一航空技工学校勤俭办学新目标
    实行半工半读争取自给自足
    据新华社西安15日电　西安第一航空技工学校最近提出一个勤俭办学的新目标。从明年起，他们依靠学生在实习工厂创造的财富，做到全部自给自足，不再向国家要一个钱；每年照样为国家培养三百名技术工人。
    这个学校从今年起，就逐步实行达到自给自足的具体方案。方案中规定，全校学生半工半读，结合教学大纲在实习工厂要生产九十台车床、五百台柴油机、三百台电动机和八十台航空仪表试验器等成套的产品，总产值可以达到二百一十多万元。这样，这个学校从今年实习生产中净得的利润，加上过去三年实习生产中净得的利润和储备材料价值，年底总共可积累约一百二十多万元流动资金，便能基本满足从明年起组织扩大再生产的需要。明年实习工厂总产值将增加到二百九十多万元，从其中取得的利润就能做到全校经费自给自足。
    这个学校从1953年建校以来，一直坚持了勤俭办学的原则。他们利用国民党遗留下来的集中营房屋做校舍，用九十多台旧式皮带车床办实习工厂。当时，虽然附近其他单位盖了许多高楼大厦，但他们发扬了过去老解放区勤俭办事业的光荣传统，不伸手向国家要钱。全校师生团结一致，在设备条件极端艰难的情况下给国家培养人才。他们从1954年起，便执行“以生产实习为主”的办校原则，逐步承揽外活，结合教学大纲让学生制作有价值的产品。实习工厂的产值连年增加。1956年比1954年增加了二十倍，1957年又比1956年增加三分之一强。在这期间，国家为培养每个学生每月的生产实习费，逐年从十五元降低到五元。这个学校结合教学大纲安排生产实习的结果，技术水平迅速提高。学生在教师帮助下，用破旧车床试制成一百多种新产品，制出二十多种航空仪表。
