A Good Example of Running Enterprises Thriftily and Diligently
By our reporter in Hubei

	A Nursery Room for Three Dimes
	The joint state-private owned Xiangfan Cotton Mill has one hundred and thirty-eight female workers and over two hundred children. Establishing a nursery was an urgent request from the female workers. Xu Xiuzhen has many children, low income, and a difficult life. After giving birth to her third child, there was no one to take care of the baby. When she went to work, she locked the child in the house. Once, the child fell from the bed and almost died. From then on, many female workers with children could not concentrate on production. A female worker in the fifth workshop brought her child to the workshop because there was no one to take care of it. The workshop was a civilian house. The female workers were winding bobbins upstairs, and the male workers were weaving downstairs, separated only by a layer of boards. The child urinated upstairs, and the urine leaked through the cracks in the boards onto the heads and cloth of the weaving workers. Male and female workers often quarreled over these matters. The male workers wanted the female workers to take the child away, and the female workers said, "Where do you want me to take the baby?" The workers all complained about why the factory didn't set up a nursery. Liang Yanbin, the secretary of the factory's Party branch, was pondering: If we set up a nursery, it would cost several hundred yuan. Our family is so poor that we really don't have the strength. If we don't set it up, the masses' demands are so urgent that it will inevitably affect production. What should we do? She thought: We can't compare with other factories. Setting up a nursery should cost less money or even no money. If we can't afford a nursery, we will set up a "baby group." She shared this idea with everyone, and they all agreed. The chairwoman of the women's union gave up her room for the nursery to use. The room had no windows, and it was very dirty. Liang Yanbin and the secretary of the Communist Youth League, Fu Mingying, and the health worker, Wang Peiheng, cleaned up the room. They spent a dime to buy flour to make paste, then spent another dime to buy lime, found some old newspapers, and everyone worked together, brushing, pasting, leveling the ground, and opening windows. They whitewashed the room clean and bright. Fu Mingying took the pictures she had pasted in her room and put them in the small room.

	With a room, everyone筹办 (chóubàn - raise money and materials)for furniture. They used wooden sticks to nail the sides, dismantled a few waste boxes, found old wooden boards, and nailed them into a bed, which became a "cradle." They also mobilized the female workers to bring their own quilts, children's chairs, and cradles. They used torn cloth pieces to make a door curtain. The children didn't have paper to wipe their bottoms after defecating, and what should they do if the diapers were wet and there was no fire to dry them? Liang Yanbin suggested using waste paper used to wrap yarn to wipe the children's bottoms. The health worker found an old brazier frame and a paint can lid and nailed them together to make a brazier, and used an old charcoal basket to weave a drying rack, using leftover charcoal fire from cooking to dry the diapers. The factory selected two employees' family members who had financial difficulties and were suitable for taking care of children to be the childcare workers. In this way, with only thirty cents, they set up a fully equipped nursery room.

	The female workers welcomed this nursery room very much. When the children needed to be breastfed, the childcare workers personally brought the children to their mothers. Everyone reflected: "It's a wonderful thing! Sending the children to the nursery, the children have simply entered socialism." Some female workers said: "It costs little money, but the work is done well."

		Building a Bathhouse Themselves
	Previously, the factory did not have a bathhouse, and the workers often grumbled. Chen Xulin said: "The leaders say to develop this and that, but there isn't even a place to take a bath. The new bathhouse built by the towel factory is so good!" Everyone demanded that the factory solve the bathing problem. Factory Director Ruan Yisheng required that things be done in accordance with the principle of spending less money and solving the problem. The chairman of the labor union then convened a meeting of workshop cadres to discuss the issue of building a bathhouse. Some people suggested building a tile house. Sanitation team leader Lu Yuanbing said: "No, the factory director and secretary often say that we are a poor factory. If we don't deliver cloth for three days, we don't even have money to buy bean sprouts." Everyone decided to build a shed as a bathhouse. Where should it be built? Some people suggested building it outside the courtyard, but most people said that building it outside would require enclosing it on three sides with straw mats, which would cost more money. Finally, it was decided to build it in the corner of the courtyard, which would save straw mats and cost less money since it could use the walls on two sides. In order to buy cheap straw mats, they went around the streets several times and finally bought a few used straw mats. On a Sunday, everyone started working, some carrying stones to level the ground, some setting up wooden frames and tying straw mats, and soon the men's bathhouse was built. Then, they used the corridor of the room, pasted newspapers on the wall to make a partition, sewed a door curtain with two pieces of gauze, and cleaned up a women's bathhouse. The factory took out two yuan to buy a large wooden basin for the bathhouse. In this way, the men's and women's bathhouses opened with a total cost of six yuan. When the workers were taking a bath, they said, "It doesn't cost much money, but it feels great to wash." "Our bathhouse is small but mighty."

	Using Ash Water Instead of Kerosene
	The factory has one hundred and twenty-five machines. In order to clean the machines, fifteen or sixteen catties of kerosene were needed each month. In order to save kerosene, everyone was thinking of tricks. Secretary Liang Yanbin thought that everyone usually uses ash water to wipe tables and wash rags, so it must also remove oil stains from machines. She discussed this with workers Huang Xirui, Lu Yuanbing, and others. They all agreed and made experiments and improvements, and the effect was very good. When ash water is dripped onto an oil stain, it turns white, and the ash water also makes the machine bright and shiny, even better than using kerosene. Now the whole factory uses ash water to wipe the machines, which can save one hundred and eighty catties of kerosene each year.

	Secretary Repairs the Toilet, Factory Director Works as a Mason
	Previously, the male and female workers in the sixth workshop shared one toilet. The toilet was originally surrounded by reed mats, but because the sow (raised by the factory) was nesting, it tore down the reed mat wall. It was inconvenient for the female workers to use the toilet, and the male workers were embarrassed to go because the toilet could not cover people. If a mason was hired to repair it, it would cost more than four yuan, so Party branch secretary Liang Yanbin organized the cadres to repair it themselves, without spending a penny. In half a day, they built a circle of walls around the toilet, and also separated the male and female toilets, meeting the workers' needs. After the toilet was repaired, the workers discussed behind their backs: "Who would have cared about this in the past (referring to the private period)?" When the cadres were working, the workers were busy pouring tea, and when they finished work, the workers were busy taking out their own towels to wash the cadres' faces.

	The drainage ditch behind the kitchen of the first workshop had not been dug for more than a year. The silt blocked the drainage ditch, and the dirty water could not flow out, overflowing and causing people to step on mud when passing by. The old woman who was twisting yarn would accidentally fall. Factory Director Ruan Yisheng and the section chief, accountant, statistician, etc., volunteered to repair the drainage ditch. They dug out the silt, and also dug out a pile of worms and maggots. The factory director also leveled the road and even paved the bricks at the entrance of the toilet. The workers praised the factory director as a true master, saying that the cadres were very energetic in doing things. From then on, the factory director led the cadres to participate in voluntary labor frequently, and the phenomenon of drainage ditch blockage never happened again.

	No-Cost Cooling Measures
	In the summer of 1957, Xiangfan City was unusually hot, and the temperature in the workshop reached as high as ninety-nine degrees Fahrenheit. The production workshop was also an old-fashioned house with poor ventilation and no cooling equipment. In order to solve this problem, health worker Wang Peiheng proposed a rationalization proposal of "cooling with well water." The factory immediately adopted this suggestion. The cadres used the workers' rest time every noon to carry well water and sprinkle it on the roof and pour it on the ground, which could lower the temperature by two degrees. The workers said: "The cadres really care about the workers, and the factory director even carries water to cool us down." In 1957, no one in the factory suffered from heatstroke, and no one suffered from malaria or dysentery. When the flu was most severe in Xiangfan City, no one in the factory stopped working due to illness.

	Amateur Barber Shop
	The workers don't have time to go out for a haircut unless it's Sunday. Going out for a haircut on Sunday requires waiting and delays the factory's machine maintenance. The workers in the fifth workshop discussed setting up their own barber shop. Zhu Sangui said: "Let's buy a set of tools and cut our own hair." Gao Tongjin said: "It doesn't matter if we cut it well or badly, as long as we can cut it and save money. We have financial difficulties and must save in all aspects." Everyone discussed and pooled money to buy tools. In order to cover the expenses of soap, hot water, and other consumables, people who didn't contribute money to buy tools are charged five cents for each haircut, three cents for children, and seven cents for female workers. The eighteen people in the entire workshop can save ninety-three yuan and sixty-eight cents in haircut fees each year. The factory strongly supported them, gave them a fine cloth covering to use as a barber's cape, and called on other workshops to learn from them. Now the first workshop has set up a female worker barber group.

	Because this factory adheres to the spirit of not wasting a penny, the average administrative management fee per person per month in 1957 was only eighty-eight cents.

    勤俭办企业的好榜样
    本报驻湖北记者
      三角钱办个托儿间
    公私合营襄樊棉织厂有一百三十八个女工，二百多个小孩，成立托儿所是女工们的迫切要求。徐秀珍小孩多收入少，生活困难，生下第三个孩子无人照管，上班时把孩子锁在屋子里。有一次，孩子从床上掉下来，差一点栽死了。从此，许多有孩子的女工都不能安心生产。五车间一个女工因无人照管孩子，上班时便把孩子带到车间。车间是一幢民房，女工倒筒在楼上，男工织布在楼下，上下只隔一层板，小孩在楼上小便，小便就从板缝漏到织布工人头上和布上。男女工人经常为这些事吵架，男工要女工把孩子弄走，女工说：“你们要我把娃娃弄到哪里去？”工人都埋怨厂里为什么不办托儿所。厂里党支部书记梁彦斌心里在琢磨：办托儿所吧，要花好几百元，自己家底这样单薄，确实没有力量；不办吧，群众的要求这样迫切，势必影响生产。怎么办呢？她想：我们不能与别的厂比，办托儿所要少花钱甚至不花钱才行，办不起托儿所就成立娃娃组。她把这个想法说出来同大家商量，大家都同意。女工主席让出自己住的一间屋子给托儿所用。房子没有窗子，屋内也很脏，梁彦斌就和团支书傅明英、保健员王培衡等收拾房子。他们花一角多钱买面粉，煮浆糊，再花一角多钱买石灰，找些旧报纸来，大家一齐动手，刷的刷，糊的糊，平地的平地，开窗子的开窗子。把房子粉刷得干干净净，明明亮亮。傅明英把自己屋里贴的画拿去贴在小屋里。
    有了房子，大家又筹办家具。他们用木棍钉上椿，拆了几个废箱子，找来旧木板，钉成一个床铺，这就是“摇篮”。他们还动员女工自己带被子，带小孩坐椅和摇篮。他们用破包布拼连起来做成一个门帘。孩子大便没纸擦屁股，尿片子湿了没有火烤怎么办呢？梁彦斌提议用包纱的破纸来给小孩擦屁股，保健员找来一个旧火盆架和颜料筒的盖子，钉成一个火盆，用旧炭篓编成一个烘罩，用烧饭的余炭火来烤尿片子。厂里挑选两个生活有困难、又适合看小孩的职工家属当保育员。就这样，只花了三角来钱，便办了一个样样俱全的托儿间。
    女工们非常欢迎这个托儿间。小孩要吃奶，保育员亲自把孩子送到妈妈跟前。大家反映说：“怪美的事！把娃子送到托儿间，娃子简直到了社会主义。”有的女工说：“花钱少，事情可办的好。”
            自己办澡塘
    以前，厂里没有澡塘，工人们经常嘀咕。陈绪林说：“领导说发展这发展那，可是连个洗澡的地方也没有。人家毛巾厂盖的新澡塘多好啊！”大家纷纷要求厂里解决洗澡问题。厂长阮宜生要求本着花钱少、能解决问题的原则办事，工会主席便召集车间干部开会研究盖澡塘的问题。有的人提议盖个瓦房，卫生队长卢元炳说：“不行，厂长、书记经常说我们是穷厂，三天不交布，连买豆芽的钱都没有。”大家就决定搭个席棚子当澡塘。搭在什么地方呢？有的人提议搭在院子外面，但多数人说搭在外面，就要三面围席子，花钱多，最后决定搭在院子角里，可以两面就墙节省席子少花钱。为了买便宜席子，他们在街上转了好几个圈子，最后买到几张用过的席子。在一个礼拜天大家动手干，有的抬石头平地坪，有的栽木架子扎席子，很快就把男澡塘盖好了。接着，他们又利用房间的过道，用报纸糊了糊遮壁，用两块纱包缝了个门帘，收拾打扫了个女澡塘。厂里拿出两块钱给澡塘买了个大木盆。就这样，总共花了六块钱，男女塘澡便开张了。工人们洗澡的时候说：“花钱不多，洗着可美。”“我们的澡塘是庙小神通大。”
        灶灰水代替煤油
    全厂一百二十五部机子，为了把机子擦干净，一个月得十五、六斤煤油。为了节省煤油，大家都在想窍门。书记梁彦斌想到平时大家用灶灰水抹桌子、洗抹布，一定也可以退机器上的油渍。她便和工人黄喜瑞、卢元炳等研究，他们都很同意，并作了试验和改进，效果很好。灶灰水往油渍上一滴，就变成白的了，还用灰水把机子擦的明亮亮的，比用煤油擦还好些。现在全厂都是用灶灰水擦机子，每年可以节约煤油一百八十斤。
    书记修厕所，厂长当泥匠
    以前，六车间男女工人共用一个厕所。厕所原是芦席围起来的，因母猪（厂里自己喂的）闹窝，把芦席墙扯坏了。女工上厕所不方便，男工见厕所遮不住人也不好意思去。请泥工修理吧，要开支四块多钱，于是，支部书记梁彦斌便组织干部们自己动手修理，一个钱不花，大半天时间，便把厕所垒了一圈围墙，还使男女厕所分门别户，满足了工人们的要求。厕所修好了，工人们背后议论：“过去（指私营时期）的经理谁管这？”干部们劳动的时候，工人忙着端茶，收工时，工人又忙着拿出自己的毛巾给干部洗脸。
    一车间厨房后面的阴沟，一年多来没有请人挖过，淤泥把阴沟堵住了，脏水流不出去，溢了出来，使人们过路踩污泥，倒纱的老婆婆，一不小心就摔交。厂长阮宜生和股长、会计、统计等便一起义务劳动修阴沟。他们挖掉了污泥，还挖出大堆虫和蛆。厂长还把路平一平，连厕所门口的砖也铺好了。工人们夸奖厂长真像个师傅样，说干部们做事真泼辣。从此以后，厂长带领干部们经常参加义务劳动，阴沟堵塞现象再也没有了。
    不花钱的降温措施
    1957年夏天，襄樊市格外的热，车间温度高达华氏九十九度。生产车间又是旧式房子，通风条件差，又无降温设备。为了解决这个问题，保健员王培衡提出了“井水降温”的合理化建议，厂里立即采纳了这个建议。干部们便利用每天中午工人休息的时间挑井水洒房顶、泼地下，这样可降温两度。工人说：干部真会关心工人，厂长还挑水给我们降温。”1957年全厂没有一个人中暑，没有一个人患疟疾、痢疾。襄樊市流行性感冒最严重的时候，厂里也没有人因病停过工。
          业余理发铺
    工人们不逢星期天没有时间出去理发。星期天出去理发又要等，又耽误厂里维修机器。五车间工人们便商量自己搞个理发铺。朱三贵说：“咱们去买一套家伙（用具），自己来理发。”高通金说：“我们理好理坏没关系，只要能理、省钱就行了。我们生活困难要从各方面节约。”大家商商量量，就凑钱买工具。为了开支肥皂、热水等消耗，不出钱买工具的人理一次发收五分钱，小孩三分，女工七分。全车间十八人，一年可以节约理发费九十三元六角八分。厂里很支持他们，给他们一个细布的包皮布做理发围布，并号召其他车间向他们学习。现在一车间搞了一个女工理发组。
    这个厂因为本着不浪费一文钱的精神办事，1957年行政管理费平均每人每月只有八角八分。
