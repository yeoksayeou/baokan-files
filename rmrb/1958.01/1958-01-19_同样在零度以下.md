Those who lived in Shanghai before liberation have a deep impression: when it was extremely cold one night, people would find people frozen to death by the roadside the next morning. At that time, "bones of the frozen dead on the road" became frequent news in the newspapers. The situation completely changed after liberation. The government arranged for the elderly, orphans, and homeless people wandering in the streets to be resettled. In recent days, Shanghai has experienced its coldest spell in fifteen years – a chilling -10 degrees Celsius. Not only has no one frozen to death, but the helpless elderly are living happily in nursing homes. (Attached photo)
	This photo was taken on the night of January 16th, the coldest night in Shanghai so far. The location is in a Shanghai nursing home. Wang Daosheng (left one) and Li Shunsheng, elderly people who used to sleep on the streets in the winter before liberation, are leisurely playing chess with their companions. The life of sleeping in the open in severe winter has become a memory of the past.

	Ten years ago in Shanghai (late January 1948), the temperature dropped to between -1.8 and -4.2 degrees Celsius. Newspapers reported that on the evening of January 25th alone, ninety-nine people froze to death. The picture shows the elderly and orphans sleeping on the streets of Shanghai on a cold night before liberation.

    同样在零度以下
    解放前冬天在上海住过的人，都会有这样深刻的印象：当前一天晚上酷寒的时候，第二天清早从马路上经过，总会发现路旁有被冻死的人，当时的报纸上，“路有冻死骨”成为经常的新闻。解放后的情况完全变了。流浪街头的老人、孤儿和无家可归的人，都由政府设法安置了。近几天上海经受了十五年来最冷的一次——摄氏零下十度的袭击下，不但没有冻死人，而且无依无靠的老人正在养老院过着愉快的生活。（附图片）
    这张照片是在到目前为止上海最冷的夜晚——1月16日晚间拍摄的。地点是在上海养老院里。解放前冬天露宿在马路上的老人王道生（左一）和李顺生，正在安闲地和同伴下着象棋。严冬露宿的生活已经成为历史的记忆了。

    上海十年前的冬天（1948年1月下旬），气温下降到摄氏零下一度八到四度二之间，报上刊载着：单单在1月25日这天晚间，就冻死了九十九人。图中是解放前寒夜露宿在上海街头的老人和孤儿。
