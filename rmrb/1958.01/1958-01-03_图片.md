    The recent release of the "Draft Plan for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet" by the State Council has inspired the students of the Mandarin Chinese pronunciation research class in Beijing. The Mandarin Chinese pronunciation research class is jointly organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Education. Students here include Chinese language teachers from primary and secondary schools, and normal schools across the country. After six months of study, they have deeply realized the advantages of the Chinese phonetic alphabet. People who originally did not understand Mandarin Chinese have learned Mandarin Chinese with the help of the Chinese phonetic alphabet. Now, the students in this class are about to graduate, and they are full of enthusiasm and confidence to promote Mandarin Chinese and promote the reform of the written language.

    最近国务院公布的“汉语拼音方案草案”鼓舞了北京的普通话语音研究班的学员们。普通话语音研究班是中国科学院和教育部联合举办的，在这里学习的有全国各地的中、小学和师范学校的语文教师们。他们经过六个月的学习，深刻体会到汉语拼音字母的优越性，原来根本不懂普通话的人，靠着汉语拼音字母学会了普通话。现在，这个班的学员们快要毕业了，他们满怀热情和充分的信心去推广普通话和促进文字的改革。  新华社记者　楚英摄
