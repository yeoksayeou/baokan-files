    Speaking Frankly
    The new British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Derick Heathcoat-Amory, said at a Conservative meeting in Shalden, Devon, when discussing the British government's financial policy: "I doubt whether it is possible at present to expect both to win popular support and do what is right on some economic issues." He advocated "taking the right action rather than taking popular action."
    In the eyes of the governments of capitalist countries, the "correctness" of financial policy depends on whether such policy can ensure that monopoly groups obtain more profits. In order to ensure that monopoly groups can obtain more profits, it is necessary to make the working people tighten their belts and "endure greater sacrifices," which inevitably leads to a loss of popular support. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer's open admission of this is indeed "speaking frankly."

    打开天窗说亮话
    英国新任财政大臣德里克·希思寇特—埃默里在德文郡夏尔登一次保守党人的会议上谈到英国政府的财政政策时说：“我怀疑目前在一些经济问题上是否能够期望既得民心又做得正确。”他主张“宁愿采取正确的行动而不采取得民心的行动”。
    在资本主义国家的政府看来，财政政策的“正确”与否，要看这种政策是否能保证垄断集团得到更多利润。而为了保证垄断集团能得到更多利润，就势必要让劳动人民勒紧裤带、“忍受更大的牺牲”，也就不能不失去民心了。英国财政大臣能够公开承认这一点，倒是“打开天窗说亮话”。
