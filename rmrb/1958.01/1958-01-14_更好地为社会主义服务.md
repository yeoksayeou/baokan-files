    Better Serve Socialism

    Our research work should serve socialist construction and should be closely integrated with the needs of the country. However, in formulating the 1958 research plan, we have shown some unsatisfactory phenomena. The research topics for 1958 were basically proposed by the topic groups themselves (including national tasks). For example, the research work our special topic group was originally doing was a national task, but now the Ministry of Chemical Industry does not need it anymore, so we have to find our own topics. Our future research results may be somewhat useful academically, but we are very vague about how much contribution they can make to the country's construction. Our special topic group itself is responsible, but the leadership is even more responsible. We hope to establish an academic committee as soon as possible, and better strive for the help of the Scientific Planning Commission and industrial departments to understand the national economic development plan in detail. Only in this way can our research work better serve socialist construction.

    Also, there was not enough consultation in discussing the plan, and the preparation for the discussion was very poor. (Abstract)

    更好地为社会主义服务
    我们的研究工作，应该为社会主义建设服务，应该密切结合国家的需要。然而我们在制订1958年研究计划时，却表现出一些不能令人满意的现象。1958年的研究题目基本上是各题目小组自己提出的（其中也包括国家任务）。譬如我们专题小组原来做的研究工作是一个国家任务，现在化学工业部不需要了，因此我们不得不自找题目。我们今后的研究结果可能在学术上有点用处，但对国家的建设究竟能有多大的贡献，思想上十分模糊。我们专题小组本身有责任，领导上更有责任。希望尽快地成立学术委员会，更好地争取科学规划委员会和产业部门的帮助，详细了解国民经济发展计划。这样才能使我们研究工作更好地为社会主义建设服务。
    还有，在讨论计划方面征求意见不够广泛，讨论的准备工作也做得很差。（摘要）
