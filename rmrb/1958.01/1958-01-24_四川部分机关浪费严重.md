Title: Serious Waste in Some Sichuan Agencies

In Sichuan Province, during the rectification movement, many staff and workers of agencies and enterprises exposed serious waste phenomena within their units.

Last year, the Provincial Grain Bureau built more than ten large-scale mechanized warehouses capable of storing over 800 million catties of grain. Among them, seven-tenths of the warehouses had two-meter-deep conveying troughs on the bottom floor. However, due to the lack of careful investigation and research of the geological conditions beforehand, most of the conveying troughs are now flooded with groundwater, turning them into fish ponds. This item alone resulted in a loss of over 600,000 yuan. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative only uses thirty to forty cars regularly, but last year it built a repair plant capable of repairing and fitting one hundred and twenty cars. Until now, due to the large scale of the factory buildings and the lack of funds, electricity, and water, the entire plant cannot be put into production.

Some units adopted the approach of "acting first and reporting later," requesting additional investment from higher authorities for non-productive construction, which also resulted in significant waste. The Supply and Marketing Section of the Provincial Department of Industry urgently needed to build more staff dormitories, and the department approved a construction fund of 60,000 yuan. However, the leaders of this section, without seeking instructions, arbitrarily diverted this fund to build a three-story office building. Preliminary estimates show that over 140,000 yuan has already been spent. The section does not have many staff members, and one floor would be sufficient. Now they have to allocate the remaining two floors for an industrial products exhibition hall. The Provincial Department of Urban Construction originally allocated 30,000 yuan to the Provincial First Engineering Company to build a clinic. However, this company built a hospital instead, which ended up costing 130,000 yuan.

The phenomenon of excessively special living and welfare facilities for some leading cadres has also been criticized by staff and workers. For example, the new dormitory built by the Provincial Highway First Engineering Bureau in October last year clearly separated the bureau chief and section chief from the general cadres. The dormitory for bureau chief-level cadres included a bedroom, reception room, built-in wardrobe, bathroom, and kitchen, while the facilities in the general cadres' dormitory were relatively simple. The Yibin Electric Porcelain Factory allocated 40,000 yuan specifically to build a bathroom for the factory's leading comrades. Before the bathroom was built, there was no good design, and soon after completion, the foundation subsided, resulting in another allocation of 2,000 yuan for repairs.

### 四川部分机关浪费严重

    四川部分机关浪费严重
    本报讯　四川省许多机关、企业职工，在整风运动期间，揭发了本单位的严重浪费现象。
    去年，省粮食厅修建了能容纳八亿多斤粮食的十多座大型机械化仓库，其中十分之七的仓库底层，还修了两公尺深的输送槽。但由于事先没有对地质情况进行仔细的调查研究工作，现在大部分输送槽都浸满地下水，变成了养鱼池。仅此一项，就损失六十多万元。省供销社经常使用的汽车才三、四十辆，而去年却修建了一座能修配一百二十辆汽车的修配厂。直到现在，由于厂房规模较大，缺乏资金、电源和水源，全厂都不能投入生产。
    有些单位采取“先斩后奏”的办法，要求上级追加非生产性建筑的投资，浪费也很大。省工业厅供销处急需增建职工宿舍，厅里就批拨了六万元的修建费；但是这个处的领导人未经请示，擅自把这笔款挪用修建了一幢三层办公大楼。初步估计，已花了十四万多元。这个处的工作人员不多，有一层楼就够用了，现在只好把其余两层拨出去作工业品展览馆。省城市建设厅原来拨给省一工程公司三万元，修建一个门诊部；但是这个公司却修建了一座医院，结果用去了十三万元。
    部分领导干部生活福利设施过分特殊的现象，也受到了职工的批评。如省公路一工程局，去年10月新修建的宿舍，就把局长、处长和一般干部截然分开。局长级的宿舍内，有寝室、会客室、壁上衣橱、卫生间和厨房等，而一般干部宿舍的设备就比较简单。宜宾电瓷厂拨出了四万元经费，专为这个厂的领导同志修盖了一个浴室。浴室修建前，也没有很好的设计，建成后不久地基便下沉，结果又拨款二千元加以修补。
