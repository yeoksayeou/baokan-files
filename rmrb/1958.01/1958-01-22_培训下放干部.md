Training of Downward-Transferred Cadres

    (By our newspaper) The Nanjing Automobile Parts and Accessories Factory recently transferred three batches of cadres, totaling more than 220 people. Many of them were originally administrative leaders and production management cadres. In order to train them into "both red and expert" working-class intellectuals, the factory leadership not only cares about their ideological development but also attaches great importance to improving their technical skills, and actively formulated a training plan for downward-transferred cadres.

    Most of these cadres do not understand technology. After being transferred downward, in addition to learning practical operations from master workers as apprentices, they will also systematically study technical theory in three stages. In the first stage, over a period of more than a month, using the form of popular science lectures, they will give a general explanation of simple knowledge of drawing reading, technical measurement, metal materials, and mechanical principles, so that they can comprehensively understand the general concepts of technology. In the second stage, for a period of one and a half months, professional technical training will be held separately for trainees in different types of work. In the third stage, basic technical theory training will be conducted for a period of three to six months in accordance with the teaching syllabus issued by the First Ministry of Machine Building. Through these studies, these cadres can basically have the technical theory level equivalent to that of a third-grade worker.

    The first stage of study began in late last month.

    培训下放干部
    本报讯　南京汽车制配厂最近连续下放了三批干部，共计二百二十余人。其中有不少人原先是行政领导干部和生产管理干部。这个厂的领导方面为了把他们培养成“又红又专”的工人阶级知识分子，不仅关心他们思想意识的锻炼，还十分重视他们技术水平的提高，积极制订了下放干部的培训计划。
    这些干部多数是不懂技术的。他们下放以后除当学徒跟老师傅学习实际操作以外，还将分三个阶段系统地学习技术理论。第一阶段，以一个多月时间，采取科学普及讲座形式，通俗地讲述识图、技术测量、金属材料、机械原理的简易知识，使他们全面地了解技术方面的一般概念；第二个阶段，以一个半月针对学员的不同工种，分别举办专业技术学习；第三阶段，按照第一机械工业部颁发的教学大纲进行为期三个月到六个月的基本技术理论训练。通过这些学习，这些干部基本上可以具备相当于三级工的技术理论水平。
    第一阶段的学习已经在上月下旬开始。
