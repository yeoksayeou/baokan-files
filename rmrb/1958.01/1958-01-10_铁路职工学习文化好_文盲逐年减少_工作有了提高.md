Railway Workers' Cultural Studies Are Good
Illiteracy Decreases Year by Year; Work is Improved

(Our dispatch) Railway workers' cultural education work has greatly developed during the first five-year plan period. In the second semester of the 1956-1957 academic year, more than 528,000 workers participated in spare-time cultural studies, an increase of 2.1 times compared to 1952. From 1952 to the second semester of the 1956 academic year, more than 130,000 people have been freed from illiteracy, more than 11,000 people have improved to the equivalent of upper primary school graduation level, more than 900 people have improved to the equivalent of junior high school graduation level, and 50 people have improved to the equivalent of senior high school graduation level. The cultural outlook of railway workers has changed. The proportion of illiterate people among workers has dropped from over 58% in the early days of liberation to around 36%, and the number of workers with upper primary and junior high school qualifications has increased year by year. Some grassroots units have basically eliminated illiteracy.

After the vast number of workers improved their cultural level, it played an active role in learning technology, learning politics, improving work, and increasing labor productivity. Zheng Jin, a bridge worker from the Zhangwu Engineering Section of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, was freed from illiteracy in 1956 and was able to read materials. Therefore, based on learning advanced experience, he invented a tool for replacing bridge sleepers, which doubled work efficiency and was rated as an advanced producer of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau in 1956. Another example is the Kouquan Bridge Work Area of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau. When it was first established in 1953, thirteen out of the fourteen people in the entire work area were illiterate. Including the foreman, there were only three skilled workers, and the rest were laborers. After several years of hard study, twelve workers in this work area have been freed from illiteracy and have been promoted to the fifth and sixth grades of upper primary school. Due to the improvement of cultural level, the technical level and work ability have also been greatly improved. The original eleven laborers have all been promoted to technicians, and a new foreman has been trained. Now, ordinary workers can calculate area and specific gravity, and some can perform engineering statistics, engineering calculations, and work summaries. No major or minor accidents have occurred since 1954, and production tasks have been completed well. Therefore, it has been repeatedly rated as an outstanding work area by the Datong Engineering Section.

When organizing workers to participate in spare-time cultural studies, some areas paid attention to organizing cadres, labor models, advanced producers, and activists to enroll first. Many leading cadres with low cultural levels also actively participated in spare-time cultural studies. For cadres with low cultural levels who have difficulty in persisting in systematic study in their spare time, each railway bureau and engineering bureau has established cadre cultural schools for them, or set up cultural classes in cadre schools. There are currently twenty-three such schools. The Ministry of Railways has also established a cultural department in the cadre school to transfer cadres with low cultural levels in batches to study middle and primary school courses. In the second semester of the 1956 academic year, nearly 4,000 cadres studied in the aforementioned cadre cultural schools. (Zhang Junjie)

    铁路职工学习文化好
    文盲逐年减少　工作有了提高
    本报讯　铁路职工文化教育工作，在第一个五年计划期间有很大发展。1956—1957学年度第二学期参加业余文化学习的职工有五十二万八千多人，比1952年增加了二点一倍。从1952年到1956学年度第二学期，已经有十三万多人摆脱了文盲状态，有一万一千多人提高到相当于高小毕业水平，有九百多人提高到相当于初中毕业水平，有五十人提高到相当于高中毕业水平。铁路职工的文化面貌已经起了变化，文盲人数在职工中的比例已由解放初期的58％强降到36％上下，具有高小、初中程度的职工逐年增加，有部分基层单位已经基本上扫除了文盲。
    广大职工提高文化以后，对于学习技术、学习政治、改进工作、提高劳动生产率起了积极作用。锦州铁路管理局彰武工务段的桥梁工郑金1956年摆脱文盲状态以后，能够阅读资料，因而在学习先进经验的基础上发明了更换桥梁枕木的工具，提高工作效率一倍，被评为锦州铁路管理局1956年的先进生产者。又如太原铁路管理局口泉桥梁工区，1953年刚成立时，全工区十四个人当中有十三个是文盲，连工长在内，只有三个是技术工人，其余都是杂工。这个工区的职工经过几年来的刻苦学习，已有十二人摆脱了文盲状态，并分别升入了高小五、六年级。由于文化水平的提高，技术水平和工作能力也大大提高了，原有的十一名杂工都已升为技工，并且培养出了新的工长，现在一般工人都能计算面积、比重，有的能作工程统计、工程计算和工作总结了。从1954年到现在没有发生过大小事故，生产任务也完成得好，因此，曾多次被评为大同工务段的优胜工区。
    在组织职工参加业余文化学习的时候，有些地区注意了尽先组织干部、劳动模范、先进生产者和积极分子入学，有不少文化低的领导干部也积极参加了业余文化学习。文化程度低在业余时间坚持系统学习有困难的干部，各铁路管理局和工程局都为他们举办了干部文化学校，或者在干部学校中设立了文化班。这类学校目前已有二十三所。铁道部也在干部学校中设立了文化部，分批地抽调文化低的干部学习中、小学课程。1956学年度第二学期在上述干部文化学校里学习的干部近四千人。　（张俊杰）
