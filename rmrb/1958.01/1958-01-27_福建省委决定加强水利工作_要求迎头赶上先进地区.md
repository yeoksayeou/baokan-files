The Fujian Provincial Party Committee Decides to Strengthen Water Conservancy Work
Demands Catching Up with Advanced Regions

(Our dispatch) The Fujian Provincial Party Committee convened an emergency meeting on the 19th to study various problems existing in the current water conservancy work, in order to push the water conservancy construction movement to a new high tide.

The meeting believed that the People's Daily's criticism of the slow progress of the Fujian water conservancy construction movement was correct and necessary. Although a mass water conservancy movement has been launched throughout the province, and the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses is also very high (especially in those counties where the secretaries personally take charge, the progress of water conservancy work is very fast), the province has mobilized more than 1.4 million laborers, and the construction of water conservancy has basically implemented the policy of relying on the masses. However, the current development of the water conservancy movement is extremely uneven: some county party committee secretaries have handed over water conservancy to the second or third in command, and some counties have not yet placed water conservancy work in an important position. Therefore, these places lack sufficient enthusiasm. According to statistics on the 14th of this month, as many as twenty-two counties have completed less than one thousand mu of irrigable land, while good counties (such as Nan'an) have reached five thousand mu in one township. Five counties, including Tong'an, Zhangping, Sanming, Shouning, and Haicheng, have only completed 5% of the original plan to increase irrigation area. Secondly, judging from the projects that have already started in the province, various places have not truly grasped small-scale water conservancy. Thirdly, some places have not made sufficient use of the strength of peasant technicians; some counties have not combined the training of technicians with actual projects, which has also affected the widespread construction of small-scale water conservancy. Key projects also generally have problems. Other aspects, such as material supply, the mobilization and organization of voluntary labor, also have many problems that need to be resolved. The meeting believed that the province's water conservancy work is still lagging behind compared with the requirements of the development of the situation and compared with the work of other provinces in the country. Now it is necessary to immediately grasp the water conservancy work vigorously, and the first secretaries of party committees at all levels must personally take charge. Launch a larger-scale water conservancy construction movement. In the movement, it is necessary to further overcome conservative ideas through inspection, evaluation, and on-site visits; boldly rely on and give full play to the technical strength of the peasants; leading cadres themselves must learn and understand the technology of small-scale water conservancy in order to comprehensively lead the water conservancy work. The meeting proposed to catch up with the advanced provinces and regions, not only to ensure the completion of the task of eliminating drought on two million mu, but also to strive to over fulfill it.

    福建省委决定加强水利工作
    要求迎头赶上先进地区
    本报讯　中共福建省委于19日召开紧急会议，研究了当前水利工作中存在的各种问题，以便把兴修水利运动推向新的高潮。
    会议认为人民日报对福建兴修水利运动进度迟缓的批评是正确的，是必要的。全省群众性水利运动虽然已经掀起，广大干部和群众的干劲也很大（特别是在那些书记亲自动手的县份水利工作的进度很快），全省出动民工已达一百四十多万人，兴修水利基本上贯彻了依靠群众的方针。但是，当前水利运动的开展是极不平衡的：有的县县委书记把水利交给二把或三把手，有的县还未把水利工作放在重要位置。因此，这些地方劲头很不足。到本月14日统计，完成水利可灌田面积不到一千亩的竟有二十二个县，而好的县（如南安）一个乡就达到了五千亩。同安、漳平、三明、寿宁、海澄等五县仅完成原定增加灌溉面积计划的5％。其次，从全省已动工的工程看来，各地还未真正抓小型水利。第三，有的地方对农民技术员力量运用还不够；有的县训练技术员未与实际工程相结合，也就影响到小型水利的广泛兴修。重点工程也普遍有问题。其他如在物资供应、义务工的发动和组织等方面，也有不少问题需要解决。会议认为本省的水利工作与形势发展的要求相比，与全国其他省份的工作相比，仍是差的。现在必须马上把水利工作大抓一下，而且要各级党委的第一书记亲自动手来抓。展开更大规模的兴修水利运动。在运动中要通过检查评比和实地参观访问等方法，进一步克服保守思想；大胆依靠和发挥农民中的技术力量；领导干部自己要学习和懂得小型水利的技术，以便对水利工作全面进行领导。会上提出要迎头赶上先进的省区，不但要确保完成消灭旱灾二百万亩的任务，而且要争取超额完成。
