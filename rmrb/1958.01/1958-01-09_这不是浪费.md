    This is Not Wasteful
    Regarding the situation described by Comrade Huang Xiuying, I don't think it can be considered wasteful. Why?
    Labor is for the sake of improving life. When a person gains from labor, they can use the earned compensation to improve their life (of course, not squander it). People's living standards cannot be equal; those who labor well improve faster, and those who labor poorly improve slower. Huang Xiuying bought these things without affecting her future life, nor did she borrow money from others. This cannot be called wasteful. Furthermore, if everyone refrains from buying things, where will the goods in the stores be sold? Wouldn't the state's large amount of capital be tied up?
    Frugality in managing a household has principles: what can be bought or not bought should not be bought. This does not mean that once you have something, you are not allowed to buy anything else (of course, it depends on whether it is needed). According to Comrade Huang Xiuying's statement: the cotton clothes have been worn for two years, and cotton shoes have to be made even if they are not bought. Of course, they can be bought. I think a watch is very necessary in the countryside. In the past, there were no watches in the countryside, and the standard was sunrise and sunset. Now, farmers have the means to buy watches, and although it is something that can be bought or not, it is beneficial to buy them.
    In addition, Comrade Huang Xiuying wrote in her letter: "...always wearing that old padded coat, it is really too unsightly." If buying a new cotton coat is for the sake of looking good, then I don't think it is appropriate. Buying snow cream and hair oil is unnecessary.
    Although the Party has put forward the call to work hard and build socialism, it is wrong to understand this call as meaning to wear torn clothes and broken shoes.

    这不是浪费
    根据黄秀英同志所写的情况，我认为不能算浪费。为什么呢？
    劳动就是为了提高生活。一个人劳动有了收获，就可以拿所得的报酬去改善生活（当然不能乱挥霍）。大家的生活水平不能相等，劳动好的，提高得快；劳动差的，改善得慢。黄秀英买了这些东西，并没有影响今后的生活，也没有向别人去借债。这不能说是浪费。再说，如果大家都不买东西，商店的东西向哪儿去卖呢？国家的大批资金岂不是积压起来了吗？
    勤俭持家是有原则的：可买可不买的，就不买。这并不等于有了就不准再买（当然要看是否需要）。据黄秀英同志所谈的：棉衣已经穿了两年了，棉鞋不买也得做。当然也就可以买。表，我认为在农村是很需要的。过去，农村没有表，以日出、日没为标准。现在，农民有条件买表，虽然这是可买可不买的，但买了也是有好处的。
    另外，黄秀英同志在信上写道：“……总是披着那件旧大袄，实在太难看”。如果买新棉袄是为了好看，那么，我认为这是不适当的。买雪花膏和擦头油是不必要的。
    党虽然提出了要艰苦奋斗建设社会主义的号召。但是，如果把这个号召理解成要穿破衣服、破鞋，这是不对的。
