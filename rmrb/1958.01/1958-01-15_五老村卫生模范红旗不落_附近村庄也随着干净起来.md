The Five Old Village in Nanjing has maintained its title as a National Grade A Sanitary Model Unit for five years and has achieved new successes in the recent winter sanitation campaign. The village has not only basically eliminated the "Four Pests," but has also achieved cleanliness for everyone, cleanliness for every household, a clean and beautiful environment, and widespread sanitary knowledge. The entire village, from the collective to the individual, can achieve "Three Smooths": smooth main roads, smooth alleys, and smooth open spaces; "Four Not Dirtys": not dirty ditches, not dirty courtyards, not dirty roads, and not dirty toilets; "Five Cleans": clean roofs, clean floors, clean walls, clean doors and windows, and clean corners; "Six Cleanlinesses": clean body and diet, clean clothes and bedding, clean chests and cabinets, clean tables and chairs, clean pots and pans, and clean jars and vats. In Five Old Village, every household has various rat-catching tools. Most households and streets have also set up spittoons, renovated toilets, and completely eliminated the bad habits of spitting and defecating everywhere. The entire village has also opened up three gardens of various sizes, cultivated more than 4,000 saplings along the roadsides and next to houses, and planted more than 50 kinds of flowers and plants, making the clean and tidy Five Old Village even more beautiful. It has also been rated as a first-class model for greening in Nanjing.

The reason why the sanitation and pest control work in Five Old Village can be regularized is primarily because the political level of the masses in the entire village has been continuously improved, which has promoted the continuous improvement of the sanitation level. Before liberation, Five Old Village was a slum area, with three-quarters of the village's area being stinky pits and stinky ditches. After liberation, the People's Government established sewers and tap water stations for Five Old Village. After the masses in the village understood the great significance of exterminating the US imperialist germ warfare in 1952, they launched the patriotic health campaign, fundamentally changing the natural appearance of Five Old Village. Stinky ditches became neat and spacious new lanes and main roads, and the four pests and bedbugs were basically eliminated. Since 1953, in this area where the four pests have been basically eliminated, the patriotic health work has put forward new and further demands. Under the slogan of improving the people's health, the entire village has carried out various health care tasks focusing on prevention. Except for the discovery of a few cases of measles, influenza, and whooping cough, infectious diseases such as typhoid, dysentery, and malaria have disappeared. The village has also established a Red Cross health station, with an average of one health first-aid worker for every ten or so residents. In four and a half years, they have treated and provided first aid to more than 3,600 trauma emergency patients, and have also provided prenatal check-ups and new-method deliveries for pregnant women in the village, turning "Suffering Village" into "Happy Village." Five Old Village has achieved great success in eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene. What slogan should be used to mobilize the masses at present? At this time, the Central Government announced the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, and realizing the requirements of Article 40 regarding the elimination of the four pests and diseases, supporting agricultural production became the new driving force for Five Old Village to engage in patriotic health work. The masses further clarified the new goals of eliminating the four pests and eliminating infectious diseases.

Secondly, the regularization of the patriotic health movement in Five Old Village is also due to the fact that the Party committee has used a leadership method that combines leadership with the masses, and combines backbone elements with the general public, relying on and mobilizing the masses, cultivating a large number of activists, and leading nearly half of the new households and backward households. For example, in November last year, under the leadership of the Bai Xia District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Nanjing, the residents of Five Old Village studied and discussed the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). During the discussion, they criticized the slackening thinking of some residents who believed that flies and mosquitoes had been almost eliminated, and organized the masses to conduct a major sanitation inspection. After the inspection, it was found that some households still had mosquitoes, flies, and rats, which powerfully shattered the almost mentality among the masses. In this way, the residential groups put forward letters of determination and challenge, expressing their determination to vigorously carry out the winter sanitation campaign, and also formulated specific plans.

On the eve of the New Year, more than 100 activists from Five Old Village beat gongs and drums to launch a health propaganda campaign. The four pest elimination groups and youth commando groups also launched various pest elimination and sanitation activities, and captured 93 rats, 176 mosquitoes, 3 sparrows, and 9 flies. In addition, they filled in three earthen wells, built two new street gardens, and added 15 new spittoons. The actions of the activists greatly motivated the masses. Then, the entire village launched a pre-New Year general cleaning and "great moving" campaign. All the residents moved their furniture and sundries to the front of their houses for sunning and cleaning, while the rooms were thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to eliminate the four pests.

At the same time, Five Old Village has adhered to various mass sanitation systems for five years, and this village has become a "model village where the red flag never falls." At the same time, the advanced experience of Five Old Village has been gradually推广(tuī guǎng - spread) to neighboring areas. For example, Hong Huadi and Da Yang Village have also fundamentally changed their natural appearance and were rated as advanced model units in Nanjing in 1956. Recently, the Nanjing Patriotic Health Movement Committee has summarized and sorted out the advanced experience of Five Old Village, launched a mass sanitation movement, and strived to become a "fly-free city" in 1958 and a "four-free city" within five years.

### 五老村卫生模范红旗不落  附近村庄也随着干净起来

    五老村卫生模范红旗不落
    附近村庄也随着干净起来
    本报讯　全国甲等卫生模范单位——南京市五老村五年来始终保持卫生模范称号，并在最近的冬季卫生运动中取得新的成绩。这个村不仅已经基本上消灭了“四害”还做到了人人清洁，户户干净，环境整洁美观，卫生知识普及。全村从集体到个人都能做到“三平”：大路平、小巷平、空地平；“四不脏”：沟不脏、院不脏、路不脏、厕所不脏；“五清”：屋顶清、地面清、墙壁清、门窗清、角落清；“六洁”：身体饮食洁、衣服被褥洁、箱笼橱柜洁、桌椅板凳洁、锅碗瓢勺洁、缸坛瓮罐洁。在五老村，户户都有各种捕鼠工具，绝大部分户和街道上还设置了痰盂，改建了厕所，彻底消除了随地吐痰、随地大小便的不良习惯。全村还开辟了大小三个花园，在路边宅旁培植了四千多棵树苗，种了五十多种花草，使清洁整齐的五老村更加美化起来，并且被评为南京市的绿化一等模范。
    五老村卫生除害工作所以能经常化，首先是由于全村群众政治水平不断提高，促进了卫生水平的不断提高。解放以前，五老村是一个贫民棚户区，全村四分之三的面积是臭水坑和臭水沟。解放后，人民政府给五老村建立了下水道和自来水站。1952年全村群众懂得了扑灭美帝细菌战的重大意义之后，开展了爱国卫生运动，根本改变了五老村的自然面貌，臭水沟变成了整齐宽畅的新巷大马路，并且基本上消灭了四害和臭虫。1953年以来，在这个基本上消灭了四害的地区，爱国卫生工作又提出了新的进一步的要求，全村在提高人民健康水平的口号下，开展了预防为主的各项卫生保健工作。除发现少数麻疹、流行性感冒和小儿百日咳等疾病以外，伤寒、痢疾、疟疾等传染病都绝迹了。全村还建立了红十字卫生站，平均每十个左右的居民就有一个卫生急救员，四年半处理和急救了三千六百多个外伤急救病人，还给全村孕妇作了产前检查和新法接生，使“苦恼村”变成了“欢乐村”。五老村在除四害、讲卫生方面已经取得巨大成绩，当前以什么口号来动员群众呢？正在这时，中央公布了发展农业纲要修正草案，实现四十条中有关除四害消灭疾病等方面的要求，支援农业生产就成了五老村搞爱国卫生的新的动力。群众更进一步明确了除四害、消灭传染病的新目标。
    其次，五老村爱国卫生运动的经常化，也正由于党委运用了领导和群众相结合，骨干和一般相结合的领导方法，依靠和发动了群众，培养了大批积极分子，带动了近半数的新户和落后户。例如去年11月份，在中共南京市白下区委的领导下，五老村全村居民学习并讨论了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）。在讨论过程中，批判了一部分居民中认为苍蝇、蚊子已经打得差不多了的松劲思想，组织群众进行卫生大检查，经过检查，发现还有一些住户家中有蚊、蝇和老鼠，这就有力地打破了群众中的差不多思想。这样，各居民组就纷纷提出决心书和挑战书，表示要大张旗鼓地开展冬季卫生运动，还订出了具体规划。
    在新年前夕，五老村的一百多名积极分子，敲锣打鼓展开了卫生宣传运动。除四害的各小组和青年突击组也展开了各项除害卫生活动，并且捕捉到九十三只老鼠，一百七十六只蚊子、三只麻雀和九只苍蝇等。此外还填了三口土井、新建了两座街头小花园，新添了十五个痰盂。积极分子的行动就大大带动了群众。接着，全村开展了年前的大清扫、“大搬家”运动，全村居民都把家具杂物搬到门前曝晒和清洗，室内则进行彻底的清扫和除四害。
    同时，五老村五年来一直坚持着各项群众性的卫生制度，这个村已经成为“红旗不落的模范村”。同时，五老村的先进经验，已经逐步推广到友邻地区，如附近的红花地、大杨村也根本改变了自然面貌，1956年被评为南京市的先进模范单位。最近，南京市爱国卫生运动委员会，总结和整理了五老村的先进经验，开展群众性的卫生运动，争取1958年成为“无蝇城”，五年内成为“四无城”。（附图片）
