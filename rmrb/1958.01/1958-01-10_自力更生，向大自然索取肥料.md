    Self-Reliance, Seeking Fertilizer from Nature
    Huang Jinde, Secretary of the CCP Xin'hui County Committee, Guangdong Province

    Xin'hui County's agricultural production has greatly developed after collectivization. Before collectivization, the county's sown area was only 2,030,000 mu, but in 1957 it had increased to more than 2,190,000 mu, including 430,000 mu converted from single-cropping to double-cropping and from "zheng gao" (intercropping) to "fan geng" (continuous cropping), 45,000 mu of expanded economic crops, and 10 million citrus, pineapple, and banana trees planted on wasteland and embankments, and 130,000 mu of backward fields improved. The yield of rice in 1957 increased from 330 jin per mu in 1950 to 660 jin in 1956. As production developed, the demand for fertilizer increased year by year. In 1955, 890,000 dan of chemical nitrogen fertilizer were needed, and in 1957, 1 million dan were needed, but the fertilizer supply decreased year by year. In 1957, there were only 230,000 dan of chemical nitrogen fertilizer and 33,100 dan of cake fertilizer. The fertilizer supply not being able to meet the needs of production development is the biggest problem we encountered in developing agricultural production.

    Carry out a Year-Round Manure Collection Campaign

    In order to solve this contradiction, we first conducted education on diligence and thrift in running cooperatives among the vast number of peasants, calling on the peasants of the whole county to use the spirit of hard struggle to carry out a mass year-round manure collection campaign, self-reliance, and seeking fertilizer from nature. The peasants of our county have always been accustomed to using commercial fertilizer, and they have great concerns about the idea of collecting manure, mainly five fears: (1) fear of hard work; (2) fear of high costs; (3) fear of no fertilizer sources; (4) fear that manure collection will not be effective; (5) fear of transportation difficulties, etc. For example, the grass in the sandy areas was not used in the past after harvesting; the peasants in the cultivated land areas believed that "cow dung in the field grows more grass, and green manure in the field suppresses the rice," so that very few people collected and used the green manure and livestock manure all over the mountains and fields; even more people thought that the field area was too large to collect manure, and that collecting scattered miscellaneous manure was of no help, and only commercial fertilizer could solve the problem. Based on these situations, on the one hand, we distributed the commercial fertilizer supply targets to the cooperatives as early as possible, and made it clear to the members that the only way out in the fertilizer problem was self-reliance and not to ask for it from above; on the other hand, we used specific examples to calculate the benefits of self-collected and self-made fertilizer for the members, so that manure collection and fertilizer production became the conscious demand of the masses. For example, when Shadong Third Cooperative started to mobilize manure collection, it calculated that the production cost of the whole cooperative in 1955 was more than 31,000 yuan, accounting for 51% of the total income. This account educated the cadres and members greatly. After spring plowing in 1956, the whole cooperative launched a large-scale manure collection campaign. As a result, 80% of the fertilizer was solved by self-collection, and the cost was only more than 10,000 yuan, accounting for 13% of the total income. Moreover, the yield increased by 125 jin per mu. Lile District is a district with more economic crops, and it has always relied on commercial fertilizer. When manure collection was mentioned, the peasants opposed it. Later, the members were informed of the shortage of fertilizer, and everyone was called upon to increase production and rely on themselves to solve the fertilizer problem. The accounts of increased production and income from manure collection were calculated, and the manure collection tasks were contracted to the team or individual. The manure collection campaign in the whole district quickly started.

    Establish Institutions, Strengthen Leadership

    Although our county has carried out manure collection campaigns many times in the past by using the slack time of farming, due to the lack of full-time institutions and strengthened leadership, it was often a rush when fertilizer was needed, and then let it go when fertilizer was not needed. In order to solve this problem, at the end of the year before last, the County Agriculture Bureau and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative selected 14 people to organize the County Soil and Fertilizer Office, responsible for researching and promoting advanced manure collection and fertilizer production experiences in various places, and widely surveying and organizing fertilizer sources. The township and cooperative also established Soil and Fertilizer Committees and Manure Collection and Fertilizer Production Groups (Factories) by the Deputy Township Head and the Deputy Director of the Cooperative, as well as relevant personnel from the Agricultural Technology Extension Station and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. 539 out of the 555 cooperatives in the county have now established fertilizer factories, leading the manure collection and fertilizer production work for a long time. Many cooperatives have also achieved that the cooperative has a fertilizer factory, the team has a fertilizer pond, and the household has a fertilizer pit. Due to the establishment of institutions layer by layer from top to bottom, the leadership has been strengthened, and the manure collection and fertilizer production work has been carried out for a long time. In Longbang First Cooperative, the cost of commercial fertilizer accounted for 92% of the total cost in 1955, but after the establishment of the factory in 1956, it has dropped to 54%, and in 1957 it was further reduced to 45%. The yield increased from 656 jin per mu in 1955 to 750 jin last year. In Genguang Cooperative, Gujing Township, all commercial fertilizers were used in 1956. Since the establishment of a fertilizer production group to specifically lead fertilizer production, 90% of the base fertilizer for rice fields has been solved by itself. In Luokeng District, dry toilets used to be covered with ash, and the fertilizer efficiency was greatly lost. Later, special personnel were assigned to manage the toilets, and mud powder was used to cover the excrement, which not only maintained the fertilizer efficiency, but also collected more fertilizer than in the past. In Zhongsha Cooperative, Shizui Township, green manure and garbage used to be all over the ground and no one collected them. After learning the experience of the fertilizer factory in Longbang First Cooperative, it immediately established a manure collection and fertilizer production group. In 1957, the collected and produced fertilizer solved the fertilizer problem for 85% of the fields in the cooperative.

    Adapt to Local Conditions, Find More Fertilizer Sources

    After the establishment of the institutions, the problem to be solved next is to widely tap fertilizer sources. After the cadres took the lead in leading the masses to deeply tap the potential and find fertilizer sources in various townships and cooperatives, the county found more than 100 kinds of miscellaneous fertilizers that could be used. Different regions have different manure collection methods. Sandy and embankment areas can also put mud into the field, take out mud, exchange field bottom mud for field surface mud, scoop up mud flowers, collect clams, collect marsh crabs, collect marine green manure, burn shell ash, and return rice straw to the field; mountainous and cultivated land areas can carry pond mud, burn grass skin mud, carry forest bottom mud, dig peat soil, demolish mud walls and toilet alkali mud, collect wild green manure, etc.; economic crop areas can also carry out planned rotation to improve land fertility, intercrop green manure between crop rows, and collect various crop leaves and vines for composting; in addition, no matter what kind of area, the farm manure that can be collected includes: garbage, ditch mud, sewage, straw ash, chimney ash, pig bones, cow bones, human excrement and urine, poultry and livestock manure, etc. After strengthening the leadership of manure collection and fertilizer production work, many cooperatives have achieved that people have toilets, cattle have pens, pigs have circles, and chickens and ducks have nests.

    In order to timely introduce the advanced experience of manure collection and fertilizer production in various cooperatives, we also conducted exchanges through exhibitions, comparisons, visits, typical demonstrations, and fertilizer professional meetings. In addition to the agricultural production exhibition held in the county seat every year, there is also a fertilizer hall to introduce the manure collection and fertilizer production experience in various places. The district and township also held fertilizer physical exhibitions, which played a great role in overcoming conservative ideas and promoting manure collection. In Fumei Township, more than 8,000 mu of fields were short of fertilizer in the late rice crop the year before last. When the members were asked to collect fertilizer, the members said: How can there be so much manure collected every year? Later, more than 50 kinds of local miscellaneous fertilizer samples were exhibited at the agricultural exhibition in the township. After the peasants saw it, they opened their eyes. In more than ten days, the various local miscellaneous fertilizers collected and produced in the whole township reached more than 80,000 dan, which not only solved the shortage of fertilizer for the late rice crop, but also had a large surplus. The fertilizer factory in Longbang First Cooperative is one of the better fertilizer factories in our county. Over the past year, we have organized tens of thousands of people to visit the cooperative and learn from its experience in year-round manure collection, fertilizer collection, fertilizer production, fertilizer application, and fertilizer preservation, which has also played a great role in promoting fertilizer production in the county.

    Combination of Regularity and Raids

    In addition to implementing regular manure collection, we also use the three times of winter planting, spring plowing and after the summer harvest and before the autumn harvest to carry out three high tides of manure collection campaigns. Various districts and townships have launched manure collection movement months and movement weeks during this period, concentrating their efforts to invest in the manure collection movement. For example, during the spring plowing in 1957, Huancheng District launched a manure collection movement month. In just ten days of concentrated efforts, the collected fertilizer solved the fertilizer for 28,500 mu (accounting for 55% of the paddy field area), and 74 new fertilizer ponds and 275 fertilizer pits were built. During the spring plowing in 1957, Sanjiang District concentrated its efforts to collect fertilizer, solving more than 90% of the base fertilizer and part of the top dressing for 56,000 mu of fields in the district.

    Timing, Quantity, Quality, Pricing, Cash Purchase of Members' Fertilizer

    After the establishment of the fertilizer factory in Longbang First Cooperative, in order to ensure sufficient fertilizer sources and avoid the phenomenon of intermittent fertilizer sources, it was decided to purchase any quantity and quality of fertilizer that could be processed into fertilizer, and pay for it upon arrival. They purchased more than 30 kinds of fertilizers, and each kind was priced in three grades, high, medium, and low, according to the size of the fertilizer efficiency and the difficulty of collection. For some fertilizers that were widely used and difficult to purchase, the purchase price was appropriately increased to increase the enthusiasm of the members to sell. There are many benefits of purchasing members' household fertilizer with cash, mainly: (1) it can stimulate the enthusiasm of members to collect fertilizer, collect scattered miscellaneous fertilizers, and solve the shortage of fertilizer in the cooperative; (2) it can save costs and increase income; (3) it can solve members' pocket money. Over the past year, the cash used by Longbang First Cooperative to purchase members' fertilizer was more than 5,500 yuan. The members were very satisfied with this method. They said: "With the fertilizer factory, we don't have to worry about fertilizer and pocket money." Now the members collect fertilizer whenever they have time. Whether they are working or going to the fair, they carry manure baskets along the way to pick up manure and grass. Every household has a manure collection pit at the door. Sixty-eight-year-old woman Ou Yan also collected thousands of jin in 1956 and sold it for 17 yuan. The fertilizer sold to the cooperative by the twelve students in the sixth team is enough for one semester to buy books, paper, pens, and ink. The cadres of Fumei Second Cooperative used to think that their cooperative was neither close to the mountains nor close to the water, and there was no fertilizer to collect. Later, they adopted the method of contracting fertilizer value, contracting the fertilizer cost to each team, and each team solved the fertilizer collection by themselves. The members were very motivated and automatically took out more than 300 fertilizer collection jars. The various fertilizers collected and produced in half a month solved the base fertilizer for more than 1,100 mu of fields and the top dressing for 208 mu of fields in the whole cooperative. The cost saved alone increased the income of each household by 24.5 yuan. Some cooperatives with financial difficulties used the method of exchanging goods for fertilizer, and the members were also very satisfied. Tianhu Second Cooperative used the method of exchanging local miscellaneous fertilizer for piglets, which not only eliminated the 60 households in the cooperative that did not raise pigs, but also achieved self-sufficiency in fertilizer throughout the year.

    In addition to adopting cash purchases, many cooperatives also set certain manure collection tasks in stages according to the members' abilities and seasonal slackness, and sell them to the cooperative on time. Those who exceed the quota will be rewarded. After Longbang First Cooperative implemented this method, the members proposed four no-throws: 1. Do not throw away garbage; 2. Do not throw away ditch water; 3. Do not throw away bottom mud; 4. Do not throw away melon peel and vegetable scraps, etc.

    Massive Fertilizer Production, Improved Fertilizer Efficiency, Economical Fertilizer Use, Saving Labor

    The local miscellaneous fertilizer purchased by the cooperatives has very low fertilizer efficiency. Generally, 30 to 40 dan per mu is enough, and 200 to 300 dan of pond and river mud must be applied. This requires a lot of labor to transport fertilizer. In order to solve this problem, we processed the various miscellaneous fertilizers purchased into various artificial fertilizers. Now, the artificial urine, granular fertilizer, mixed fertilizer, and fermented fertilizer of pond mud essence that have been successfully applied and promoted in the county have greatly improved the fertilizer efficiency. In 1956, the county used more than 87,000 dan of granular fertilizer, solving the fertilizer for more than 174,000 mu of rice fields. If only garbage and field materials were applied in the past, only 85,000 mu of fields could be applied, and the fertilizer efficiency was doubled. Fertilizers that have been processed not only improve fertilizer efficiency and save costs, but also generally increase production. For example, in the late rice crop of Lianfeng Cooperative, Sanjiang in 1956, 50 jin of granular fertilizer was applied per mu, and the yield per mu was 402 to 453 jin, which was 26 to 77 jin per mu higher than the surrounding fields that applied only 15 jin of field materials per mu. The cost per mu was 1.8 yuan less, and pests and diseases were also reduced compared with the past. The collection and application of artificial urine is also very common. Jiuzisha Cooperative made 20,000 dan last year, solving the fertilizer for more than 2,000 mu of fields. Tianhu Wuli Cooperative used 10 jin of hemp bran, 500 jin of human urine or cow urine, and 2,500 jin of ditch water to make artificial urine. More than 500 jin per mu was applied, and the cost was 1 yuan, and the yield per mu was 391 jin, while the cost per mu of applying 20 jin of chemical fertilizer alone was as high as 3.36 yuan, and the yield per mu was only 360 jin. Artificial urine can also be applied to economic crops. These facts prove that artificial fertilizer is an advanced method of rational fertilizer use and improved fertilizer efficiency. It can appropriately prepare fertilizers of different properties according to the different needs of soil characteristics, crop growth, and seasonal climate, so as to achieve the purpose of improving soil, increasing land fertility, and increasing yield per unit area.

    Due to the long-term manure collection and fertilizer production campaign, the fertilizer required by the county every year can now be basically solved. In 1956, the total fertilizer collected and produced in the county solved the base fertilizer and part of the top dressing for 1,210,000 mu of fields, accounting for 74% of the county's rice sown area, saving a total cost of more than 2.5 million yuan. In 1955, the cost of rice fields in agricultural cooperatives was generally more than 30%, and in 1956, more than 70% of the cooperatives had reduced it to below 20%, of which 50% of the cooperatives had reduced it to below 15%. In 1956, although the chemical fertilizer supplied by the county was more than 75,000 dan less than in 1955, and the cake fertilizer was more than 39,000 dan less, the yield per mu increased by 40 jin, and the total output increased by 338,000 dan. In 1956, 130,000 mu of backward fields were improved due to the application of local miscellaneous fertilizer, and the grain yield per mu increased by 50 to 100 jin.

    The fertilizer collected and produced in 1957 was more than that in 1956, solving the fertilizer problem for 1,222,000 mu of fields (accounting for 75% of the county's rice sown area), saving a total cost of more than 2.6 million yuan.

    自力更生，向大自然索取肥料
    中共广东省新会县委书记　黄晋德
    新会县的农业生产在合作化后有很大发展。合作化前全县播种面积不过二百零三万亩，1957年已增加到二百一十九万多亩，其中包括单造改双造和“挣稿”（间作）改“翻耕”（连作）四十三万亩，扩大经济作物四万五千亩，另利用荒地、围堤种了柑桔、菠萝、香蕉等一千万棵，改良落后田十三万亩。1957年水稻产量由1950年的每亩三百三十斤提高到1956年的六百六十斤。由于生产发展了，对肥料的需求一年比一年增加。1955年需要化学氮肥八十九万担，1957年要一百万担才够用，但是肥料供应却一年比一年少，1957年只有化学氮肥二十三万担、饼肥三万三千一百担。肥料供应不能满足生产发展的需要，是我们在发展农业生产上碰到的最大问题。
    开展常年积肥运动
    为了解决这一矛盾，我们首先向广大农民进行勤俭办社教育，号召全县农民用艰苦奋斗的精神，开展群众性的常年积肥运动，自力更生，向大自然索取肥料。我县农民一向都习惯于施用商品肥，对积肥思想顾虑很大，主要有五怕：（1）怕辛苦；（2）怕成本重；（3）怕无肥源；（4）怕积肥不生；（5）怕运输困难等。如沙田区的禾草，过去收割后都没有利用；民田区的农民认为“牛屎落田多长草，绿肥落田压死禾”，以致满山遍野的绿肥和耕畜肥，也很少人积集施用；更多的则认为田面太大，积不了，积集零星杂肥无济于事，只有商品肥料才能解决问题。根据这些情况，我们一方面把商品肥的供应指标及早分配到社，向社员交清肥料不足的底子，使社员知道在肥料问题上的出路只有自力更生，不能伸手向上要；另一方面用具体事例向社员们算自积自制肥料的好处账，使积肥制肥成为群众的自觉要求。如沙东三社开始发动积肥时，算出1955年全社生产成本用去三万一千多元，占总收入的51％。这笔账教育干部和社员很大。1956年备耕以后，全社便开展了大规模的积肥运动，结果80％肥料都自积解决，成本只用了一万多元，占总收入的13％。而且每亩增产一百二十五斤。礼乐区是一个经济作物较多的区，一向靠商品肥，提起积肥农民就反对，后来向社员交清肥料不足的底子，号召大家要增产只有靠自己解决肥料，并算了积肥的增产增收账，把积肥任务包到队或个人，全区的积肥运动便迅速掀起来了。
    建立机构，加强领导
    我县过去虽曾多次利用农事闲隙时间开展过积肥运动，但由于没有专职机构，加强领导，因此往往是需肥时就突击一下，不需肥时就又放任自流。为了解决这一问题，前年年底由县农业局、供销社抽出十四人组织县的土壤肥料办公室，负责研究和推广各地先进的积肥制肥经验和广泛勘踏、组织肥源等工作，乡和社也分别由副乡长和社的副主任以及农业技术推广站、供销社等有关人员建立土壤肥料委员会和积肥、制肥小组（厂）。全县五百五十五个社现在已有五百三十九个社建立了制肥厂，长年领导积肥制肥工作，很多社还做到社有肥厂，队有肥池，户有肥氹。由于从上而下层层建立机构，加强了领导，积肥制肥工作长期开展起来了。龙榜一社1955年商品肥成本占总成本92％，1956年建厂后已降到54％，1957年再降低到45％。而产量则由1955年亩产六百五十六斤到去年提高到七百五十斤。古井乡艮光社1956年全部用商品肥料，自从建立制肥小组专门领导制肥后，九成禾田的基肥都靠自己解决。罗坑区过去旱厕都习惯用灰盖屎，肥效损失很大，后来设有专人管理厕所，改用泥粉盖屎，不但保持了肥效，而且积的肥也比过去多了。石咀乡中沙社过去绿肥、垃圾满地无人收集，学习了龙榜一社的制肥厂经验之后，马上成立积肥制肥小组，1957年所积制的肥解决了全社85％的田的用肥问题。
    因地制宜，多找肥源
    机构建立后，跟着要解决的问题就是要广泛挖掘肥源。各乡各社经过干部带头带领群众，深入挖潜力找肥源之后，全县发现可利用的各种杂肥有一百种以上。不同地区有不同的积肥门路，沙田、围田区也可以入泥，出泥，换田底泥为田面泥，戽泥花、采蚬，采蟚蜞，采集海生绿肥，烧?灰，稻草回田等；山区和民田区可以担塘泥，烧草皮泥，担树林底泥，挖泥炭土，拆烂泥墙和厕所碱泥，积集野生绿肥等；经济作物区还可以有计划地进行轮种，提高土地肥力，在作物行间间种绿肥，采集各种作物叶藤沤肥；此外，不论那一种地区都可以积集的农家肥有：垃圾、水沟泥、污水、草木灰、烟窗灰、猪骨、牛骨、人粪尿、家禽耕畜粪尿等。加强对积肥制肥工作的领导后，很多社已经做到人有厕、牛有栏、猪有圈、鸡鸭有窝了。
    为了及时介绍各社的积肥制肥先进经验，我们还分别通过展览会、评比、参观、典型示范和召开肥料专业会议等办法进行交流。每年除在县城举办的农业生产展览会上设有肥料馆介绍各地的积肥制肥经验外，各区乡也举办了肥料实物展览会，对克服保守思想推动积肥起了很大作用。富美乡前年晚造有八千多亩田缺肥，叫社员积肥，社员说：年年积肥那有这样多呢？后来在乡的农业展览会上展出了五十多种土杂肥样品，农民看过后，打开了眼界，十多天时间，全乡积制的各种土杂肥就有八万多担，除解决晚造缺肥外，还有大量剩余。龙榜一社的制肥厂是我县办得较好的肥料厂之一，一年多来我们组织了几万人到该社参观，学习该社常年积肥、收肥、制肥、用肥、保肥的经验，对推动全县制肥作用也很大。
    经常性和突击性相结合
    除了实行经常性的积肥外，每年还利用冬种、备耕和夏收后秋收前这三个时间，开展三次积肥运动大高潮。各区乡在这个时间内都分别开展了积肥运动月、运动周，集中力量投入积肥运动。如1957年备耕时环城区开展一个积肥运动月，仅突击十天时间，积的肥就解决二万八千五百亩（占稻田面积的55％）田的用肥，并新建七十四个肥池、二百七十五个肥氹。三江区在1957年备耕期间，集中力量积肥，解决了全区五万六千亩田的90％以上的基肥和部分追肥。
    定时定量定质定价  现款收购社员肥料
    龙榜一社制肥厂建立后，为了保证肥料来源充足，避免肥源时断时续的现象，便决定不论数量多少和质量高低，只要能加工制成肥料的都收购，并随到随收随付款。他们收购的肥料品种有三十多种，每种都根据肥效大小和采集难易定出上中下三种价格，对部分用途广、收购困难的肥，还适当提高收购价格，以提高社员交售的积极性。用现款收购社员家肥好处很多，主要是：（1）能刺激社员积肥积极性，把零星分散的各种杂肥积集起来，解决社的肥料不足；（2）能节省成本，增加收入；（3）能解决社员零用钱。龙榜一社一年多来收购社员肥料的现款就有五千五百多元，社员对这一办法非常满意，他们说：“有了肥料厂，肥料零钱两不愁。”现在社员一有空就积肥，不论劳动、趁圩都挑着粪箕沿途拾粪拾草，每户社员的门口都有一个积肥氹，六十八岁的妇女欧颜1956年也积了几千斤卖了十七元。第六队十二个学生卖给社的肥就够一个学期买书本纸张笔墨之用。富美二社的干部过去认为自己的社既不靠山也不近水，无肥可积，后来采用包肥值的办法，把肥料成本折款包给各队，由各队自己积肥解决，社员劲头很大，自动拿出三百多个积肥缸，半个月内所积制的各种肥料，就解决了全社一千一百多亩田的基肥和二百零八亩田的追肥，单是节省的成本，就使每户增加二十四元五角的收入。有些资金困难的社则用实物兑换肥料的办法，社员也很满意。天湖二社用收购社员土杂肥兑换猪仔的办法，不但消灭了全社六十户养猪空栏户，而且全年的肥料都能自给自足。
    除采取现款收购外，很多合作社还根据社员能力和季节闲忙，分期定出一定的积肥任务，定时如数出售给社，超额的奖励。龙榜一社贯彻这一办法后，社员提出四不丢：一、不丢垃圾；二、不丢沟渠水；三、不丢地底泥；四、不丢瓜皮菜夹等。
    大量制肥，提高肥效  节约用肥，节省劳力
    各社收购回来的土杂肥肥效很低，每亩一般要施三、四十担才够，塘河泥要施二百担到三百担，这样就要花费大量劳动力运肥。为了解决这个问题，我们把收购回来的各种杂肥，分别加工制成各种人造肥料，现在全县已施用成功并推广的有人造尿、颗粒肥、混合肥、塘泥精发酵肥等，大大提高了肥料效能。1956年全县利用的颗粒肥有八万七千多担，解决了十七万四千多亩禾田的肥料，若按过去单施垃圾和田料只能下八万五千亩田，肥效提高了一倍。凡是加工制造过的肥料，不但提高肥效、节省成本，而且也普遍获得增产。如三江联丰社1956年晚造每亩施颗粒肥五十斤，亩产四百零二至四百五十三斤，比周围的每亩单施田料十五斤的田每亩增产二十六至七十七斤，每亩成本少用一元八角，病虫害也比过去减少。人造尿的积制和施用也很普遍，九子沙社去年制了二万担，解决了二千多亩田的用肥，天湖五里社用麻麸十斤，人尿或牛尿五百斤，沟渠水二千五百斤制成人造尿，每亩施五百多斤，成本一元，亩产三百九十一斤，而单施化肥二十斤的田每亩成本却高达三元三角六分，亩产只三百六十斤。人造尿还可以施用于经济作物。这些事实证明：人造肥料是合理用肥和提高肥效的一种先进的方法，它能根据土壤特性、作物生长和季节气候三方面的不同需要，来适当配制不同性质的肥料，达到改良土壤、提高地力、提高单位面积产量的目的。
    由于开展了长期性的积肥、制肥运动，现在全县每年所需的肥料基本可以解决。1956年全县积制的肥料共解决了一百二十一万亩田的基肥和部分追肥，占全县水稻播种面积74％，共节省成本二百五十万多元。1955年农业社的禾田成本普遍都在30％以上，1956年已有七成以上的社降低到20％以下，其中有五成的社降低到15％以下。1956年全县供应的化学肥料虽比1955年少了七万五千多担，饼肥少了三万九千多担，但每亩却增产四十斤，共增产三十三万八千担。1956年全县因施用土杂肥而改良的落后田就有十三万亩，每亩增产粮食五十斤至一百斤。
    1957年积制的肥料比1956年更多，共解决一百二十二万二千亩田（占全县水稻播种面积75％）的用肥问题，共节省成本二百六十多万元。
