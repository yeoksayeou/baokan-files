    Jilin Railway Rolling Stock Depot Workers Determined to Promote the Great Leap Forward in Production
    Vigorously Demanding Revision of Outdated Quotas
    (Our Newspaper News) According to the Jilin Daily, workers at the Jilin Railway Rolling Stock Depot have recently used forms such as big-character posters, letters of determination, and group meetings to vigorously demand the revision of outdated and backward quotas in order to meet the new tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan.
    Qian Fumin, an old worker in the passenger car carpentry group, and his apprentice, Communist Youth League member Zhou Chengming, first proposed to all workers in the depot the idea of revising the technical quotas. They said: Although the four commonly used technical quotas were only checked and implemented in June of last year, because we have created new working methods, these new quotas have fallen far behind the actual situation. For example, the quota for each electrical box is 25 minutes, but in reality, we can now make four pieces in 25 minutes. In order to accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland, we demand that the outdated quotas be revised to be advanced, even more advanced. According to their demands, the time for repairing each car can be shortened by 243 minutes.
    Their proposal aroused a universal response from workers in the depot with technical quotas. Old worker Yang Wantong wrote in a big-character poster: It only takes me 50 minutes to repair a heating valve pad, but the quota is 90 minutes. We should build our country through diligence and thrift, and struggle arduously. I hope the leadership will change the quota to 50 minutes. Car electrical annual repair workers Zhang Chengwen and Yang Zhiyuan proposed to lower five kinds of quotas, so that each car could complete the annual repair task 109 minutes faster. They said in a group meeting: Our monthly efficiency exceeds 40%-50%. We often stop working because the tasks cannot keep up, and we take the state's money for nothing. The country is our own, and we are willing to revise the quotas, contribute more strength to the country, and take less wages. We want to build socialism as soon as possible. Mechanical fitter and Communist Party member Cui Zhenhan, and Communist Youth League member Sun Dezhao, discussed with each other and proposed to revise 21 commonly used quotas.
    In just two days, more than 20 workers at the Jilin Rolling Stock Depot proposed to revise more than 70 kinds of quotas, reducing working hours by more than 1,000 minutes.

    吉林铁路车辆段工人决心促进生产大跃进
    纷纷要求修改陈旧定额
    本报讯　据吉林日报报道：吉林铁路车辆段工人，最近通过大字报、决心书、小组会等形式，纷纷要求修改陈旧落后的定额，迎接第二个五年计划的新任务。
    客车木工组老工人钱富民和他的徒弟共青团员周成明，首先向全段工人提出修改技术定额的倡议。他们说：四项常用的技术定额，虽然都是去年6月才查定施行的，但是因为我们创造了新的工作方法，使这个新的定额又大大落后于实际了。如电箱每件定额是二十五分钟，实际上现在二十五分钟可以作四件。为了加速祖国的社会主义建设，我们要求把已经落后了的定额修改得先进，更先进。根据他们的要求，每辆车修车的时间可以缩短二百四十三分钟。
    他们的倡议，引起了全段有技术定额的工人的普遍响应。老工人杨万桐在大字报里写道：我修理暖气止垫用五十分钟就可以，定额却是九十分钟。我们应当勤俭建国，艰苦奋斗，希望领导上把定额改为五十分钟吧。车电年修工人张成文、杨志远，提出要降低五种定额，使每辆车减少一百零九分钟完成年修任务。他们在小组会上说：我们每月的效率都超过40％—50％，经常因为任务供不上而停工，就白拿国家的钱。国家是我们自己的，我们愿意修改定额，多给国家贡献些力量，少拿工资。我们要早日建成社会主义。机械钳工、共产党员崔振汉，共青团员孙德照，他们互相商量，提出要修改二十一种常用定额。
    仅仅两天的工夫，吉林车辆段就有二十多名工人，提出要修改七十多种定额，减少工时一千多分钟。
