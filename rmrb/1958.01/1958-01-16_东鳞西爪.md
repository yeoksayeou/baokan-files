    Eastern Scales and Western Claws
    Mud Dredging Machine
    The Jiaxing Agricultural Machinery Factory recently successfully trial-produced a mud dredging machine.

    After being driven by an eight-horsepower diesel engine, this mud dredging machine uses the rotation of a long string of iron plates to dig up river mud from the bottom of the water. Using this machine to dredge river mud is twenty to thirty times faster than manual operation by farmers. The trial production cost of this machine is currently over 2,000 yuan, but it can be reduced to over 1,000 yuan after mass production in the future.

    River mud is one of the most commonly used soil fertilizers by farmers in the water network areas of Zhejiang and other places. Applying ten more tons of river mud per mu of land can increase grain production by 100 jin.

      Using Dragon's Beard Grass to Make Cotton
    After making artificial cotton from cotton stalk peels, the Santai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Sichuan Province recently successfully trial-produced artificial cotton from dragon's beard grass (蓑草) and paper mulberry bark. The cotton made from dragon's beard grass and paper mulberry bark is of good quality and low cost. The cost of cotton made from dragon's beard grass is only about four jiao per jin (including chemical drugs, raw materials, etc.), which is only half the price of natural cotton.

    Sichuan is rich in dragon's beard grass. Santai County alone purchased more than 7.63 million jin in 1957. Calculated at 80 jin of artificial cotton per 100 jin, the county can produce more than 6 million jin of artificial cotton, equivalent to the output of 200,000 mu of cotton fields. (Chen Shirong)

    China's First Gas Pipeline
    The survey work for the gas pipeline of the Huangguashan Gas Field in Sichuan has recently been basically completed. This is China's first gas pipeline.

    The Huangguashan Gas Field is one of the gas fields with industrial value confirmed by the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau during the First Five-Year Plan.

    After this gas pipeline is built, the natural gas produced by this gas field can be directly sent to factories for production through this pipeline.

    The pipeline project is approximately 20 kilometers long.

    The Backbone of Electrified Railways
    The Fengtai Bridge Factory recently successfully trial-produced lattice-type pre-stressed reinforced concrete catenary steel poles.

    Lattice-type pre-stressed reinforced concrete catenary steel poles are an indispensable and important material for electrified railways. Without them, electric locomotives cannot run, just like streetcars and trolleybuses cannot run without poles on both sides. This type of pole saves more than 80% of steel compared to steel poles; at the same time, it is also convenient to load and transport due to its lighter weight; using it can also save a large amount of maintenance costs. Each pole can be used for fifty to eighty years. (Lan Tian, Lan Hai)

    东鳞西爪
    捻泥机
    嘉兴农业机械厂最近试制成功一种捻泥机。
    这种捻泥机经八马力的柴油机带动以后，利用它一长串铁板的转动，把河泥从水底挖上来。使用这种机器捻河泥，比农民手工操作快二十倍到三十倍。目前这种机器的试制成本是二千多元，将来大批生产以后可以降至一千多元。
    河泥是浙江等地水网地区农民最习惯使用的土肥之一。一亩田里多施十吨河泥，即可增产一百斤粮食。
      用龙须草造棉
    四川省三台县供销合作社在用棉杆皮制成人造棉以后，最近又用龙须草（蓑草）和构叶树皮试制人造棉成功。用龙须草和构叶树皮制成的棉花，质量好，成本也低，以龙须草制成的棉花，每斤成本才四角左右（包括化学药品、原料等费），只相当于天然棉价的一半。
    四川盛产龙须草，仅三台一县，1957年就收购了七百六十三万多斤，以每百斤制人造棉八十斤计算，全县就可制造六百多万斤的人造棉，相当于二十万亩棉田的产量。　（陈世荣）
    我国第一条输气管线
    四川黄瓜山气田输气管线的勘察工作，已经在最近基本完成。这是我国的第一条输气管线。
    黄瓜山气田是四川石油勘探局在第一个五年计划内证实的具有工业价值的气田之一。
    这条输气管线建成后，这个气田所产的天然气，就可经过这条管线直接送往工厂生产。
    这个管线工程，全长约二十公里。

    电气化铁路的支柱
    丰台桥梁厂最近试制隔架式预施应力钢筋混凝土接触电线钢支柱成功。
    隔架式预施应力钢筋混凝土接触电线钢支柱是电气化铁路不可缺少的重要器材。没有它，电气机车就不能行驶，好像有轨电车和无轨电车，没有两旁的支柱不能行驶一样。这种支柱比钢支柱节省钢材80％以上；同时，由于分量较轻，装运也方便；使用它还可以省出大批维修费用。每根支柱可用五十年到八十年。　（蓝天、蓝海）
