    Medicinal Corn (Coix Seed)
    Medicinal corn (Coix Seed) has many other names, also called Chuan Gu, Qi Shi, Hui Hui Mi, Jie Li, Bodhi Seed, 薏珠, Rosary Beads, Western Shu Shu etc., generally known as Water Corn, Medicinal Corn, Coix Seed Rice and so on. This is one of China's ancient crops and is recorded in the "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic."
    Medicinal corn is both a grain crop and a medicinal crop; its economic value is relatively high. Its seeds can be used to cook porridge, grind into flour, make pastries, and brew wine, with a sweet and delicious taste. According to chemical analysis: the components of medicinal corn seeds contain 17.58% crude protein, 7.15% crude fat, 62.41% soluble nitrogen-free substances, 2.32% crude ash, and 1.01% phosphoric acid. It is a nutritious food, and also has the effects of diuresis, strengthening the stomach, and benefiting Qi. Its roots and stems are also commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine.
    Medicinal corn grows in warm and humid areas and is a water-tolerant crop, especially suitable for planting in flood-prone low-lying areas. Currently, it is planted sporadically in many regions of China, with high and stable yields. In 1957, Shangshui County, Henan Province, planted more than 2,100 mu of medicinal corn, with an average yield of about 500 jin per mu. In the same year, the small experimental farm of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee planted it in paddy fields and dry land, and it grew well. In July, medicinal corn suffered two floods, with a water depth of four feet, only the top was exposed above the water surface. After the water receded, it was still able to grow normally, yielding two to three hundred jin per mu.
    Medicinal corn belongs to the Gramineae family, and is five to eight feet tall, the stem is similar to sorghum, the leaves are similar to corn but slightly smaller, and the seedlings are purple. The tillering ability is very strong, and it can branch into more than ten to twenty plants. Male and female flowers grow in each leaf axil. Male flowers grow on the female flowers in a spike shape, and after flowering, they form oval fruits. The seed shell is hard and shiny, and comes in different colors such as white, yellow, green, brown, and black. After removing the shell, the kernel is white like rice.
    The cultivation method of medicinal corn is not special. It can be spring sown or summer sown. Spring sowing is generally between Qingming and Guyu, and summer sowing should be done as early as possible. If using spot sowing, two jin of seeds are needed per mu, and the amount of sowing can be appropriately increased for drill sowing. In order to facilitate seed germination, it is best to soak the seeds in warm water before sowing. The row spacing is generally about 1.5 feet, and about 4,000 seedlings can be left per mu. Cultivate two to three times during the growing period. Because of its strong tillering ability, it requires more fertilizer and water. Special attention should be paid to increasing the application of base fertilizer, timely topdressing, and irrigation during cultivation. The seeds of medicinal corn mature unevenly; when most of them are mature, that is, when the stems and leaves turn yellow and the upper grains are full, they can be harvested. After harvesting, they should be slightly dried and then threshed.

    药玉米（薏苡）
    药玉米（薏苡）的别名很多，又叫川谷、起实、回回米、解蠡、菩提子、?珠、数珠玉、草珠儿、西番蜀秫等，一般俗称为水玉米、药玉米、薏仁米等。这是我国的古老的作物之一，在“神农本草”一书中即有记载。
    药玉米既是一种粮食作物又是药用作物；它的经济价值较高。它的子实，可以煮粥，可以磨粉，制成糕点，可以酿酒，食味香甜。据化学分析：药玉米子实的成分含有粗蛋白质17.58％，粗脂肪7.15％，可溶无氮物质62.41％，粗灰分2.32％，磷酸1.01％。它是富有滋补养分的食品，又有利尿、健胃益气等功效。它的根、茎也是一种常用中药。
    药玉米生长在温暖湿润的地带，是一种耐涝的作物，特别适宜种植在易涝的洼地里。目前在我国很多地区均有零星的种植，产量高而稳定。1957年河南省商水县种植药玉米二千一百多亩，一般每亩产量在五百斤左右。同年安徽省省委小型试验场把它种在水田和旱地里，生长也很好。7月间药玉米遭受两次洪水的侵袭，水深四尺，仅有顶端露出水面，水退后，仍能正常生长，每亩收二、三百斤。
    药玉米属禾本科作物，高五到八尺，茎似高粱，叶似玉米而略小，幼苗为紫色。分蘖力很强，可以分枝十多株至二十多株。在每株叶腋里长出雌雄花。雄花生在雌花上，呈穗状，开花后结成椭圆形的果实，子实的壳皮坚硬，有光泽，有白、黄、青、褐、黑等不同的颜色。除去皮壳，核仁白色如大米。
    药玉米的栽培方法并不特殊。可以春播，也可夏播。春播一般在清明谷雨之间，夏播宜早。如用点播每亩需种子二斤，耧播的可以适当增加播种量。为了便于种子发芽，播种前最好采用温水浸种。行距一般在一点五尺左右，每亩可留苗四千株左右。生长期间中耕二、三次。由于它的分蘖力较强，需要的肥料、水分较多，在栽培时应特别注意增施基肥，适期追肥和灌溉。药玉米的种子成熟先后不齐；在大部分成熟时，即当茎叶发黄，上部籽粒饱满时，便可收割，收后经过微晒，再行脱粒。
