Xinhua News Agency, Xining Dispatch According to forest survey personnel who have just returned to Xining from the forest areas, the Qinghai Plateau, which has always been considered to lack forest resources, has 1.3 million hectares of forest, which is larger than originally estimated. The four forest survey teams of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry have been surveying the southern slopes of the Qilian Mountains and the mountainous areas along the upper reaches of the Yellow River for several months. Except for the forest area of the Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which is still an estimated figure, the forest resources in other areas of the province have been field-surveyed.

Most of Qinghai Province's forests are distributed in the southern foothills of the Qilian Mountains and the mountainous areas along the Yellow River. The main tree species are spruce, juniper, and oil pine, which are used for construction timber. The storage volume per hectare in these forest areas is as high as 400 to 500 cubic meters in some places.

    青海高原有森林一百三十多万公顷
    据新华社西宁电　据刚从林区回到西宁的森林调查人员谈，一向被认为森林资源缺乏的青海高原有森林一百三十万公顷，比原来估计的面积大。青海省农林厅的四个森林调查组在祁连山南坡和黄河上游沿岸的山区调查了好几个月，除了果洛藏族自治州的森林面积还是估计的数字外，全省其他地区的森林资源都经过了实地调查。
    青海省的森林大多数分布在祁连山南麓和黄河沿岸的山区一带。树种主要是云杉、圆柏、油松等建设用材。这里的林区每公顷积蓄量有的高达四百到五百立方公尺。
