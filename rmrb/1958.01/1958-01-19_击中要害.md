    Hitting the Nail on the Head
    The British "Daily Herald" expressed dissatisfaction with Macmillan's reply to Bulganin's letter. It questioned the British Prime Minister: "Why not show it with action?"
    The demand to take action in the struggle for peace, and not to remain on verbal statements, is something that Macmillan has repeatedly emphasized in his recent speeches. However, what he himself emphasizes is actually what he himself lacks the most. The "Daily Herald's" question can be said to have hit Macmillan's nail on the head.

    击中要害
    英国“每日先驱报”对麦克米伦答复布尔加宁的信表示不满，它质问这位英国首相：“为什么不以行动表现？”
    要求在争取和平方面采取行动，而不要停留在言词上，这是麦克米伦最近的言论中屡次强调的。但是，他自己所强调的东西，实际上是他自己所最缺乏的。“每日先驱报”的质问，可以说是打中了麦克米伦的要害。
