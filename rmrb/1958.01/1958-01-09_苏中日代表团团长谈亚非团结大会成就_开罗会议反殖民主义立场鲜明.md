Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 8th - The Hungarian newspapers "People's Freedom" and "National News" today published the statements of the heads of the Soviet, Chinese, and Japanese delegations who participated in the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference.

The delegations from the Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, and Japan, among other countries, passed through Budapest on the 7th on their way home from Cairo. Due to weather conditions, these delegations stayed in Budapest for a day and continued their flight to Moscow this morning.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Rashidov, said that the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was particularly successful. He pointed out that the previous Bandung Conference was attended by representatives from only twenty-nine countries, while the Cairo Conference was attended by representatives from about fifty Asian-African countries. This fact alone is enough to illustrate the success of the conference. Although Western countries tried to undermine the conference, their wishes were not fulfilled.

Rashidov said that the resolutions of the Cairo Conference have great historical significance. They correctly express the will of the people of all countries and their desire for disarmament, condemnation of power politics, and the Cold War. Therefore, the Soviet delegation believes that the Cairo Conference was a success. This conference greatly deepened the friendship between the peoples and contributed to the development of the peace movement.

The head of the Chinese delegation, Guo Moruo, said that at this conference, we took a stand against the Eisenhower Doctrine, sharply condemned the resolutions of the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and condemned the manufacture and use of nuclear weapons. We believe that these resolutions of the Cairo Conference are fully in line with the will of peace-loving people. Guo Moruo also said that the conference established a permanent body, with the Egyptian representative as chairman and the Soviet representative as one of the four vice-chairmen, which we consider to be a very important fact. This conference was a success. It will further promote close cooperation and help solve future tasks.

The head of the Japanese delegation, Tokutaro Kitamura, also believed that the conference was successful. He said that although the situations of many countries participating in the conference are very different from Japan, we are willing to work with them for the common goal of banning atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. We believe that the idea of peace will spread from Cairo to the whole world and have a good impact. After returning home, we will strive to promote the continued development of the peace movement.

    苏中日代表团团长谈亚非团结大会成就
    开罗会议反殖民主义立场鲜明
    新华社布达佩斯8日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”和“民族报”今天登载了参加亚非人民团结大会的苏联、中国和日本代表团团长的谈话。
    苏联、中国、蒙古和日本等国的代表团7日在从开罗回国途中经过布达佩斯，由于天气关系，这些代表团在布达佩斯停留了一天，已于今天早上继续飞往莫斯科。
    苏联代表团团长拉希多夫说，亚非人民团结大会获得了特别的成功。他指出，上次万隆会议只有二十九个国家的代表参加，这次开罗会议约有五十个亚非国家的代表参加。这一事实足以说明会议的成功。西方国家虽然力图破坏这次会议，但是它们的愿望并没有达到。
    拉希多夫说，开罗会议的决议有着巨大的历史意义，它们正确地表达了各国人民的意志，表达了各国人民要求裁军、谴责实力政策和冷战的愿望。因此，苏联代表团认为，开罗会议是开得成功的，这次会议大大地加深了人民之间的友谊，有助于和平运动的发展。
    中国代表团团长郭沫若说，在这次会议上，我们采取了反对艾森豪威尔主义的立场，尖锐地谴责了北大西洋公约集团巴黎会议的决议，谴责了制造和使用核武器。我们认为，开罗会议的这些决议是完全符合爱好和平的人民的意志的。郭沫若还说，会议成立了常设机构，主席是埃及代表，苏联代表是四个副主席之一，我们认为这个事实很重要。这次会议是成功的。它将进一步促进紧密的合作和有助于解决今后的任务。
    日本代表团团长北村德太郎也认为这次会议是成功的。他说，虽然有许多参加会议的国家的情况和日本有很大的不同，但我们愿意和它们一起为禁止原子武器和其他大规模毁灭人类的武器的共同目的而斗争。我们相信和平思想会从开罗传播到全世界，并且产生良好的影响。我们在回国后将努力促进和平运动的继续开展。
