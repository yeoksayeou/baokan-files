Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 27th: Jiangsu Province's patriotic health campaign to eliminate the "four pests" (rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes) has revised its plan from eight years to four years to become a "four-without" province. This was announced at the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee's symposium of advanced units and individuals in the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the "four pests," which concluded on the 27th. The symposium, which began on the 25th, saw representatives from seventeen cities and counties exchange experiences over three days. They realized that as long as conservative thinking is broken, leadership is strengthened, and widespread publicity and education are carried out to mobilize the masses, the movement to eliminate the "four pests" can achieve a great leap forward. The representatives proposed initiating a province-wide competition among cities, counties, towns, townships, communes, factories, and schools to eliminate the "four pests." Dong Jian, Deputy Director of the Nanjing Municipal Health Bureau, proposed that Nanjing eliminate the "seven pests" (mosquitoes, flies, rats, sparrows, snails, bedbugs, and cockroaches) in two years, and achieve "five-without" status in the urban area this year. Wang Ming, Deputy Mayor of Yangzhou, proposed achieving "six-without" city status this year, basically eliminating the "six pests" before "May Day," and completing assessment before "August 1st." Wu Jiang, Shu Yang, Jinshan and other counties have proposed achieving "four-without" county status within two years. Many advanced individuals have also put forward new targets for the personal elimination of the "four pests."

    修改原有规划　缩短一半时间
    江苏决心四年成为“四无”省
    据新华社南京27日电　江苏省爱国卫生运动除“四害”规划由八年改为四年实现“四无”省。这是中共江苏省委会在27日结束的全省除“四害”爱国卫生运动先进单位、人物代表座谈会上宣布的。这个座谈会从25日开始，十七个市县的代表在三天的经验交流中看到了，只要打破保守思想，加强领导，广泛开展宣传教育，发动群众，除“四害”运动是完全可以大跃进的。代表们纷纷提出倡议开展全省各市、县、镇、乡、社、工厂、学校除四害大竞赛。南京市卫生局副局长董健提出南京市两年消灭“七害”（蚊子、苍蝇、老鼠、麻雀、钉螺、臭虫、蟑螂），城区内今年就要实现“五无”。扬州市副市长王铭提出今年实现“六无”市，“五一”前基本消灭“六害”，“八一”前做好鉴定。吴江、沭阳、金山等县都提出在两年内实现“四无”县。很多先进人物也提出了个人除“四害”的新指标。
