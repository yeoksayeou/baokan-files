Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 2nd. Burmese Federal Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and some members of the Burmese Goodwill Economic Delegation, accompanied by Sichuan Provincial Governor Li Daizhang, visited Dujiangyan in Guanxian County on the 2nd. Dujiangyan, a nationally renowned irrigation system that irrigates more than 5 million mu of farmland on the Chengdu Plain, aroused great interest in Vice Premier U Kyaw Nyein. He stood on the banks of the rushing river, repeatedly watching the engineering aspects of Dujiangyan and asking detailed questions about various aspects of it. After a visit of more than two hours, he said to the person in charge of the Dujiangyan Management Office that the project was "excellent."

At 3:00 p.m., Vice Premier U Kyaw Nyein and others also visited the No. 1 Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Pixian County. Vice Premier U Kyaw Nyein visited the cooperative's dairy cows and pigs. He was very interested in the small hydropower station built by the agricultural cooperative itself. When he heard that this small hydropower station, used for lighting and rice milling, had achieved great benefits with very little money, he nodded repeatedly and said: Very good. He invited Sichuan Provincial Governor Li Daizhang, Agricultural Cooperative Director Liu Deming, and Wu Guangming, the young technician in charge of the hydropower station, to take a photo together next to the hydropower station as a souvenir.

    吴觉迎副总理在四川参观都江堰
    新华社成都2日电　缅甸联邦副总理吴觉迎和他率领的缅甸友好经济考察团部分团员，2日在四川省省长李大章的陪同下，到灌县都江堰参观游览。这个灌溉成都平原五百多万亩田地的全国著名的都江堰，引起了吴觉迎副总理的极大兴趣。他站在湍急的河岸边，反复观看都江堰的工程面貌，详细地询问了有关都江堰的各项问题。在进行了两个多小时的参观访问以后，他对都江堰管理处的负责人说，这个工程“好极了”。
    午后三时，吴觉迎副总理等还参观访问了郫县第一高级农业社。吴觉迎副总理参观了社内的奶牛、生猪。他对农业社自建的小型水电站很感兴趣。当他听说这个用来照明、碾米的小型水电站只花很少钱就获得很大收益时，连连点头说：很好。他邀请四川省省长李大章、农业社主任刘德明、社内负责水电站的青年技术员吴光明，在水电站旁边一起摄影留念。
