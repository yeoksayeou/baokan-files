Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, January 14th: According to TASS, the West German Social Democratic Party's "Social Democratic News Bulletin" accuses the United States of adopting a delaying policy on the issue of East-West talks. The "News Bulletin" opposes the United States demanding that the Soviet Union agree to a series of "preconditions" before the United States agrees to hold negotiations, and opposes the United States taking "free elections" in Germany as one of these "preconditions." The "News Bulletin" emphasizes that in Bulganin's letter, the Soviet Union demonstrated its sincerity.

The "News Bulletin" points out the danger of delaying the holding of negotiations. It emphasizes that: If the governments of Western countries continue to delay the time for holding East-West talks until they feel that all military departments have "superiority" over the Soviet Union, "that would be unfortunate." The "bulletin" points out: "This is primarily the expectation of US Secretary of State Dulles, who is exerting strong pressure on the governments of Western countries for this purpose."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 14th: Bonn News: A spokesman for the West German Social Democratic Party parliamentary group criticized on the 13th West German government spokesman Ekardt for not clearly expressing his attitude towards Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.

Ekardt said at a press conference in Bonn on the 13th that the West German government would not make a decision on Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe before the NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting in March. At the same time, he said: "People cannot demand that the Americans equip their troops stationed in Western Europe with only incomplete weapons."

In this regard, the spokesman for the Social Democratic Party parliamentary group pointed out that the West German government is still attempting to deceive residents with delaying tactics, saying that it is still considering the plan for a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe and waiting for the corresponding conclusions of military experts, which is "not of much significance." He also pointed out that, in fact, the West German government is "prepared to reject this proposal" or "put forward many conditions to make genuine negotiations on this proposal impossible."

    西德社会民主党赞成东西方会谈
    指责美国采取拖延政策
    揭露波恩政府准备拒绝中欧无原子区建议
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社波恩14日讯：西德社会民主党的“社会民主新闻公报”指责美国在东西方会谈问题上采取拖延政策。“新闻公报”反对美国要苏联答应一系列的“先决条件”之后美国才同意举行谈判，并且反对美国把在德国举行“自由选举”作为这种“先决条件”之一。“新闻公报”强调说，在布尔加宁的信中，苏联表明了它的诚意。
   “新闻公报”指出拖延举行谈判的危险性。它强调说：如果西方国家的政府把举行东西方会谈的时间一直拖延到它们感到所有军事部门都具有对苏联的“优势”的时候，“那将是一个不幸”。“公报”指出：“这一点首先就是美国国务卿杜勒斯的期望，他为此对西方国家的政府施加了强大的压力。”
    新华社柏林14日电　波恩消息：西德社会民主党议会党团发言人13日抨击西德政府发言人埃卡特不对波兰关于建立中欧无原子武器地区的建议明确地表示态度。
    埃卡特13日在波恩的记者招待会上说，西德政府将不会在今年3月间召开北大西洋公约组织国防部长会议之前就波兰关于建立中欧无原子武器地区的建议作出决定。同时他又说：“人们不能要求美国人只用不完备的武装来装备他们在西欧的驻军”。
    社会民主党议会党团发言人就此指出，西德政府仍然企图用拖延策略来欺骗居民，说它还在考虑中欧无原子武器区的计划和等待相应的军事专家的结论，这是“没有多大意义的”，他并且指出，事实上，西德政府“准备拒绝这个建议”或“提出许多条件来，使得就这个建议进行真正的谈判成为不可能”。
