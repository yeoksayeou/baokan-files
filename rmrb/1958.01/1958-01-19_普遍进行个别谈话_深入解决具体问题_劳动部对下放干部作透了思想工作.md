(News report) The Ministry of Labor has created a very good experience in conducting ideological work for transferred cadres. This is: leading cadres universally conduct individual talks with transferred cadres, and in light of each person's different circumstances, truly solve each person's specific ideological problems and specific difficulties. This enables the transferred cadres to eliminate concerns and happily embark on the labor front.

In mid-December, the Ministry of Labor began the work of transferring cadres. Ma Wenrui, Minister of Labor, made a report on labor training for transferred cadres. At that time, 20% of the people actively requested to be transferred, but most people lacked a correct understanding of labor training. Some people believed that participating in labor training in the countryside would not be combined with their professional work, and they were concerned that they would forget their professional skills; some people believed that participating in physical labor was not honorable and was a loss of face; some people who grew up in the city were afraid of the hard life in the countryside and could not bear it. In response to the above ideological situation, the Ministry of Labor's Rectification Leadership Group raised several major questions such as: What is the purpose of labor training? What attitude should we take towards labor training? They let everyone discuss it. Through repeated discussions and debates, many people who had unclear understandings in the past realized that labor training is an important measure to implement the Party's cadre line, and actively signed up to apply for transfer.

At this time, the Ministry of Labor's Rectification Leadership Group believed that the discussion and debate meetings did solve some common and relatively major problems, but some of the specific ideological conditions and specific difficulties of each person may not necessarily be reflected. Therefore, it was decided that all leading cadres should universally and deeply conduct individual talks with comrades in their own units. From individual talks, they would continue to discover existing ideological problems and specific difficulties, and patiently help them solve these problems. Therefore, a upsurge of leading cadres finding ordinary cadres for individual talks was set off in the Ministry of Labor. All bureau and division-level leading cadres actively sought individual talks with their subordinates. The leading cadres of the Training Bureau conducted three to four individual talks with each transferred cadre. Before the transfer list was approved, they talked with all staff members once to fully understand the ideological situation and specific difficulties, laying the foundation for approving the list. After the list was approved, they talked again before it was announced, formally telling the individual that the unit's Rectification Leadership Group had agreed to the transfer. If the individual had no objection, it could be reported to the ministry for approval. After the list was announced, they talked again to specifically help the transferred cadres solve ideological problems and specific difficulties, and consolidate their confidence in the transfer. Some comrades in the Ministry Rectification Leadership Group talked with transferred cadres more than four times, sometimes until late at night. Because individual talks are heart-to-heart conversations between two people, the talks are intimate and specific. Subordinates easily tell the truth, and leading comrades easily conduct specific education in a targeted manner, so ideological problems are solved more deeply and thoroughly.

From individual talks, many new problems were discovered. Because in the past they were afraid of being ridiculed by others, they were unwilling to raise them in the discussion meeting, but they only said them during individual talks. For example, there was a member of the Communist Youth League in the General Office who was not married but had a lover. Although he signed up for the transfer, he was concerned that his lover would not love him after the transfer. In the Allocation Bureau, some older comrades had not found a lover. Although they also asked for a transfer, they looked at themselves "over twenty-five years old, and no one mends their clothes when they are torn," worrying that if they stayed down for a few more years, it would be even more difficult to find a lover when they returned. Some comrades who were not in good health were concerned that labor would affect their illness. Because they were afraid of being called "backward," they dared not say it at the meeting.

After the leaders grasped the specific ideological situation of each person from the individual talks, they patiently and meticulously carried out persuasion and education in light of their specific circumstances. For example, Liu Yunqing, a deputy director of the Party member who once thought that he might not need training, was approached by Bureau Chief Wei Zuomin for three talks, explaining to him the reason why old cadres also need training. In the end, Liu Yunqing actively requested the transfer.

From individual talks, it was found that some people had specific difficulties, and realistic solutions were also carried out. For example, many people were concerned about their health problems, so they sent people to the hospital to fully understand the situation. Some people had some minor problems, but doctors proved that labor did not affect their health. They were approached again to explain the doctor's opinion, thus removing their ideological concerns. Some people were ill, and doctors proved that they could not participate in labor training. For example, Xia Jie of the General Office looked young and strong, but the doctor said that he had lung disease and could not be transferred, so he was not allowed to go. For some people who had economic difficulties, such as Dai Zhenying who owed thirty yuan, the leaders considered his economic situation and lent him thirty yuan to pay off the debt.

Because the leaders of the Ministry of Labor paid attention to adopting the method of individual talks in addition to discussion and debate meetings to solve the specific ideological problems and specific difficulties of each person, all of the one hundred and twenty-three cadres who have been transferred were happy and not only actively labored after the transfer, but also integrated with the farmers and humbly learned from the farmers.

### 普遍进行个别谈话　深入解决具体问题  劳动部对下放干部作透了思想工作

    普遍进行个别谈话　深入解决具体问题
    劳动部对下放干部作透了思想工作
    本报讯　在对下放干部进行思想工作中，劳动部创造了一个很好的经验。这就是：领导干部同下放干部普遍地进行个别谈话，针对每个人的不同情况，确实地解决每个人的具体思想问题和具体困难。使得下放干部都能消除顾虑，愉快地走上劳动战线。
    12月中旬，劳动部开始进行干部下放的工作，劳动部部长马文瑞同志作了有关下放干部劳动锻炼的报告。当时有20％的人积极要求下放，但是大部分人对劳动锻炼缺乏正确认识，一部分人认为下放到农村参加劳动锻炼，和他的业务不能结合，耽心会把业务忘了；一部分人认为：参加体力劳动不光荣，是丢面子；一部分在城市里长大的人怕农村生活苦，吃不消。劳动部整风领导小组针对以上思想情况，提出了劳动锻炼的目的是什么？我们对于劳动锻炼应该采取什么态度等等几个主要问题，让大家讨论。通过反复座谈、辩论，许多过去认识不清的人认识到劳动锻炼是实现党的干部路线的一项重要措施，积极报名申请下放。
    这时，劳动部整风领导小组认为座谈会、辩论会确实解决了一些普遍性的比较重大的问题，但是，每个人的具体思想状况、具体困难问题有些仍不一定能反映出来，因此，决定各个领导干部普遍、深入地和本单位同志个别谈话，从个别谈话中，继续发现存在的思想问题和具体困难，并且耐心地帮助他们解决这些问题。于是，就在劳动部掀起一个领导干部找一般干部个别谈话的热潮，所有局、处级领导干部都积极找下面同志个别谈话。培训局领导干部与每一个下放干部个别谈话三至四次，在下放名单未批准前，与所有工作人员谈一次话，全面摸清思想情况和具体困难，为批准名单打下基础。名单批准后，公布之前再谈一次，正式告诉本人，已经本单位整风领导小组同意下放，如本人无意见，就可报部批准。名单公布后再谈一次，具体帮助下放干部解决思想问题和具体困难，巩固下放信心。部整风领导小组有些同志和下放干部谈话四次以上，有时谈到深夜。由于个别谈话是两个人促膝畅谈，所以谈起来亲切、具体，被领导同志容易说真心话，领导同志也容易针锋相对地进行具体教育，思想问题也就解决得更深更透。
    从个别谈话中，发现许多新的问题。因为过去怕别人讥笑，不愿意在座谈会上提出，到个别谈话时才说出来。如办公厅有一个共青团员，没有结婚，有了爱人，他虽然报名下放，但是耽心下放以后爱人会不爱他。调配局有个别年龄较大的同志，没有找到爱人，虽然也要求下放，但看看自己“年过二十五，衣破没人补”，顾虑再下去几年，回来找爱人更加困难。一些身体不怎么好的同志，耽心劳动对病有影响。由于怕人家说是“落后”，不敢在会上说。
    领导上从个别谈话中，掌握了每个人的具体思想情况以后就针对他们的具体情况，耐心地、细致地进行说服教育。如党员副处长刘云清曾认为自己不一定需要锻炼，局长魏佐民同志先后找他谈了三次话，对他说明老干部也需要锻炼的道理。最后，刘云清积极要求下放。
    从个别谈话中，发现了一些人有具体困难，也进行了实事求是的处理。比如不少人顾虑身体问题，他们就派人到医院去全面了解一下，有些人有些轻微的毛病但是经医生证明劳动并不影响身体，又再找他们，说明医生的意见，这样，他们的思想顾虑解除了。有些人因有病，经医生证明不能参加劳动锻炼，如办公厅夏捷看上去年轻力壮，但医生说他有肺病不能下放，就没有让他去。对有些人经济上有困难的，如戴振英欠债三十元，领导上考虑了他的经济情况，就借给他三十元，把债还了。
    由于劳动部领导上在座谈、辩论会以外，注意了采取个别谈话的方式，解决每个人的具体思想问题和具体困难，因此使得已经下放的一百二十三个干部，个个心情愉快，下放后不仅积极劳动，而且和农民打成一片，虚心向农民学习。
