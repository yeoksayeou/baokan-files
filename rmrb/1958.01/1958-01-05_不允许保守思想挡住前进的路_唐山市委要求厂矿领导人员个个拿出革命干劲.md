Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 3rd -- The Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at a recent expanded meeting attended by leading cadres of various factories and mines, reviewed the rectification and preparation work for the high tide of industrial production. At the meeting, they criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of some factory and mine enterprise leaders who underestimated the upcoming high tide of industrial production and lacked drive. They called on cadres and workers in all factories and mines to muster revolutionary drive to ensure that production in the first quarter of this year is not lower than the actual production level of the fourth quarter of last year.

In Tangshan, a new and magnificent high tide of industrial production is forming, following the high tide of rectification in factories and mines. After twelve tunneling teams in Kailuan Linxi Mine launched a production competition within the same type of work, nine teams had achieved the conditions stipulated in the full-month competition plan by December 26th of last year. Workers at Qixin Cement Plant started a competition between mills and shifts in early December last year, and production levels continued to increase. By the 28th, they had completed the fourth quarter plan to increase production by 5,000 tons of cement ahead of schedule. The meeting pointed out that at present, some leading cadres of factories and mining enterprises underestimate the new situation. They believe that the upcoming high tide of industrial production is not much different from the past increase production and conserve practice movement; they did not realize that after this rectification movement and socialist education movement, the workers' political consciousness and labor enthusiasm are higher than in any previous political movement. Therefore, in the face of the new high tide of industrial production, they showed a lack of leadership, insufficient drive, emphasized many difficulties, and the preliminary production targets set for 1958 were too low. According to last year's actual production level, Tangjiazhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine can increase its output to 2.07 million tons in 1958 with a little effort. However, Kailuan Coal Mine only assigned the mine a production task of 1.9 million tons, which is 20,000 tons less than last year's actual production figure. The average actual pig iron consumption for producing one ton of steel in Tangshan Steel Plant last year had dropped to 1,180 kilograms, but when the plant formulated the production plan for the first quarter of this year, it emphasized that the supplied pig iron may have a high phosphorus content and high consumption. Therefore, it stipulated that the pig iron consumption for each ton of converter steel in the first quarter would be 1,190 kilograms, which is 10 kilograms more than the actual consumption last year.

The meeting required leading cadres of all factories and mines to lead the new high tide of industrial production with revolutionary drive, and to fully prepare for the high tide of production. In January this year, workers must be mobilized to re-revise the plan for increasing production and practicing economy in 1958, especially the first quarter. The meeting required that all factories and mines producing raw materials should increase production as much as possible on the premise of ensuring quality; factories and mines with difficulties in raw material supply should try every means to reduce raw material consumption, study and try substitutes, and save raw materials to ensure increased production on the principle of ensuring product quality; factories and mines with difficulties in production, supply and sales should actively undertake orders; and trial-produce new products that meet market needs. At the same time, all factories and mines must resolutely implement the rectification policy to the end, thoroughly carry out systematic rectification work, and promptly mobilize the masses to launch a high tide of production.

    不允许保守思想挡住前进的路
    唐山市委要求厂矿领导人员个个拿出革命干劲
    新华社唐山3日电　中共唐山市委在最近召开的有各厂矿党委领导干部参加的市委扩大会议上，检查了整改和工业生产高潮准备工作。会议上，批判了某些厂矿企业领导干部对即将到来的工业生产高潮估计不足，干劲不大的右倾保守思想，号召各厂矿的干部和职工鼓起革命干劲，保证今年第一季度的生产不低于去年四季度的实际生产水平。
    唐山市随着厂矿企业整改高潮而来的，一个新的规模壮阔的工业生产高潮正在形成。开滦林西矿有十二个掘进队开展同工种生产竞赛后，到去年12月26日就有九个队的工人实现了全月竞赛条件中规定的保证计划。启新水泥厂工人，从去年12月初就开展起磨与磨、班与班的竞赛，生产水平不断提高，到28日提前完成了去年第四季度增产五千吨水泥计划。会议指出，目前有些厂矿企业的领导干部对新形势估计不足，他们认为即将到来的工业生产高潮和往年的增产节约运动不会有多大区别；他们没有认识到经过这次整风运动和社会主义教育运动，工人的政治觉悟和劳动热情高于过去的任何一次政治运动。因此他们在新的工业生产高潮前面表现了领导气魄不大，干劲不足，强调困难多，初步拟定的1958年的一些生产指标偏低。开滦煤矿唐家庄矿根据去年的实际生产水平稍加努力就能使1958年的产量提高到二百零七万吨，但是开滦煤矿只分配给这个矿一百九十万吨的生产任务，这个数字比去年的实际生产数字还少二万吨。唐山钢厂去年每炼一吨钢的平均实际生铁消耗已降到一千一百八十公斤，但这个厂在制定今年第一季度的生产计划时，强调供应的生铁可能含磷高，消耗大，因而规定第一季度每一吨转炉钢的生铁消耗为一千一百九十公斤，比去年的实际消耗还多十公斤。
    这次会议要求各厂矿领导干部要以革命的干劲，领导好新的工业生产高潮，并且要充分做好生产高潮的准备工作。在今年1月份，要发动职工群众，重新修订1958年的特别是第一季度的增产节约计划。会议要求凡是生产原材料的厂矿，在保证质量的前提下尽量增产；原材料供应有困难的厂矿，在保证产品质量的原则下想尽一切办法降低原材料消耗，研究试用代用品，节约原料保证增产；凡是产供销都有困难的厂矿，要积极承揽订货；并试制适应市场需要的新产品。同时各厂矿要坚决贯彻一竿子扎到底的整改方针，彻底作好系统整改工作，及时发动群众掀起生产高潮。
