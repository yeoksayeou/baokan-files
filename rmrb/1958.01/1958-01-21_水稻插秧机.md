    (This newspaper dispatch) The first Model 57 rice transplanter was recently produced at the Nanjing No. 4 Machinery Factory. This transplanter was designed by the Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and is a relatively good transplanter currently available.

    The factory will produce one hundred Model 57 rice transplanters before March 15 and send them to various regions for testing. After further research and improvement, a decision will be made on large-scale production.
