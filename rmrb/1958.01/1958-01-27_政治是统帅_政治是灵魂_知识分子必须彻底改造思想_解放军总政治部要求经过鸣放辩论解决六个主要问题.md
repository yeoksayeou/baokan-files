    Politics is the Commander, Politics is the Soul
    Intellectuals Must Thoroughly Remold Their Thinking
    General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army Demands the Resolution of Six Major Issues Through Airing Views and Debate
    (By Our Staff Reporter) A dispatch from *Liberation Army Daily*: The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army recently convened a propaganda work conference to discuss the issue of ideological remolding of intellectuals. The conference studied the current ideological state of intellectuals, pointing out that politics is the commander and the soul, and that intellectuals must continue to thoroughly remold their thinking.
    The responsible comrade of the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department made a special report on this issue. The report pointed out that after the anti-Rightist struggle, the majority of intellectuals have greatly improved politically and ideologically. However, since the anti-Rightist struggle mainly resolved contradictions of an enemy-versus-ourselves nature, the various political and ideological problems of intellectuals could not be completely resolved in this struggle. The report summarized the more common erroneous thoughts among intellectuals in the army into six major issues:
    1.  Some intellectual cadres or students have not thoroughly resolved the question of which system, socialism or capitalism, is superior. Some are nostalgic for or praise the so-called democratic system of the bourgeoisie, and are dissatisfied with or unaccustomed to the proletarian dictatorship and democratic centralism; some doubt that "the East wind prevails over the West wind" and believe that the capitalist system still has "vitality."
    2.  After the anti-Rightist struggle, there are very few people who openly oppose the leadership of the Party, but there are still a considerable number of people who doubt the leadership of the Party. They admit that the Party can lead the cause of revolution and construction, but they doubt that the Party can lead natural science and technology; they admit that the Party Central Committee and higher-level organs can lead scientific, technological, and artistic work, but they doubt that their own units and grassroots units can lead these tasks; they admit that they should accept the leadership and supervision of Party organizations, but they doubt or oppose the leadership activities of Party grassroots organizations.
    3.  Some people still have doubts and resistance to ideological remolding. Some believe that intellectuals are "superior, advanced, and more important" than workers and peasants, and that workers, peasants, and soldiers are "dirty, stupid," and have nothing worth learning; some doubt and oppose the methods of ideological remolding, and are resistant to various political movements, especially participating in physical labor, which they are very dissatisfied with, considering it "lowly work" and a waste of time. A small number of people even attempt to deny the necessity of ideological remolding, saying that "since social systems can coexist peacefully, then ideological viewpoints can also seek common ground while reserving differences."
    4.  Some people demand supra-class democracy and freedom, and neglect and oppose discipline and centralization, saying that "discipline is an invisible rope, and centralization will stifle individuality."
    5.  Some people advocate being expert before being red, and loudly proclaim "technology is above all else," opposing technology and art serving politics, and opposing the idea that politics is the leader and the soul.
    6.  Some people haggle over military ranks, levels, treatment, and status. Some crave ease and enjoyment, preferring to be in large cities, unwilling to be in medium and small cities, and even more unwilling to go to border areas and islands; they prefer to be in organs and schools, unwilling to be in companies. Many people are single-mindedly trying to become experts and associate doctors, in order to gain personal honor and status.
    The report pointed out that the various erroneous thoughts revealed by intellectual cadres differ in degree. All units should conduct in-depth investigations into the ideological situation of intellectuals, conduct specific analyses, and, in conjunction with the current rectification work, or in future socialist education courses, earnestly resolve them through enlightenment reports, airing views and debates, reading documents, and summarizing and improving.

    政治是统帅　政治是灵魂
    知识分子必须彻底改造思想
    解放军总政治部要求经过鸣放辩论解决六个主要问题
    本报讯　解放军报消息：解放军总政治部最近召开的宣传工作会议，讨论了知识分子思想改造问题。会议研究了知识分子目前的思想状况，指出：政治是统帅、是灵魂，知识分子必须继续彻底地改造思想。
    总政治部宣传部负责同志就这个问题作了专题报告。报告中指出：经过反右派斗争，知识分子中多数人在政治上和思想上都有了很大提高。但是，由于反右派斗争所解决的主要是敌我性质的矛盾，知识分子政治上和思想上的各种问题不可能在这个斗争中完全解决。报告将当前部队中知识分子比较普遍存在的错误思想，归纳成六个主要问题：
    一、有些知识分子干部或学员思想上对于社会主义与资本主义制度哪个优越的问题，还没有彻底解决。有的人留恋或赞扬资产阶级的所谓民主制度，不满意或不习惯无产阶级专政和民主集中制；有的人怀疑“东风压倒西风”，认为资本主义制度还有“生命力”。
    二、反右派斗争后，公开反对党的领导的人已经很少了，但怀疑党的领导的人还为数不少。他们承认党能够领导革命和建设事业，但怀疑党能够领导自然科学技术；他们承认党中央和高级机关能够领导科学、技术和文艺工作，但是怀疑本单位和基层单位能够领导这些工作；他们承认要接受党组织的领导和监督，但是怀疑或反对党的基层组织的领导活动。
    三、有些人对思想改造仍有怀疑和抵触思想。有人认为知识分子比工农“优越、先进、作用大”，认为工农兵“肮脏、愚笨”，没有什么值得学习的；有的人怀疑和反对思想改造的方法，对各种政治运动有抵触情绪，尤其对于参加体力劳动，很不满意，认为这是“下贱活”，是虚度光阴。少数人还企图否定思想改造的必要性，说什么“既然社会制度可以和平共处，那么思想观点也可以求同存异”。
    四、有的人要求超阶级的民主与自由，忽视和反对纪律与集中，说什么“纪律是无形的绳子，集中会扼杀个性”。
    五、有些人主张先专后红，高唱“技术高于一切”，反对技术、文艺为政治服务，反对政治是领导、政治是灵魂的思想。
    六、有些人斤斤计较军衔、级别、待遇、地位。有些人贪图安逸和享受，愿在大城市，不愿在中、小城市，更不愿到边疆、海岛；愿在机关、学校，不愿到连队。许多人一心想当专家、副博士，以便博取个人的荣誉和地位。
    报告指出：知识分子干部暴露出来的上述各种错误思想，在程度上是有区别的。各单位要深入调查知识分子的思想情况，进行具体分析，并结合当前的整改工作，或者在今后的社会主义教育课程中，通过启发报告，鸣放辩论，阅读文件和总结提高等步骤，认真地加以解决。
