Your Excellency Prime Minister:

    I express my best thanks to Your Excellency for your warm and friendly welcome and gracious hospitality, and express my greatest pleasure at the profound brotherly feelings that you and the people of your heroic ancient nation have shown to me and my companions, as well as to your brothers, the people of Yemen.
    I am very willing to tell you how Yemen and the entire Arab world praise the position that you and the Chinese people have taken on the issues of the peoples of Asia and Africa, especially on the issues of the Arab world. Your active and constructive participation in the work of the Bandung Conference played a significant and positive role in the success of the conference and the adoption of various principles, which guaranteed the solution of the problems of revolutionary Asia and Africa and the problems of universal peace.
    When the Arabs were subjected to aggression, especially during the disastrous days of the treacherous aggression against Egypt, you all rose up to defend the Arabs, which left the best impression in the hearts of all the people of the Arab world and those who defend freedom and peace. Because of your position, Afro-Asian solidarity has changed from an ideal and the wish of optimists into a living reality.
    The Arabs are now watching the activities of the Chinese delegation at the Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference in Cairo with great pleasure. From the activities of the Chinese delegation, they can clearly see that China is determined to move forward courageously to defend freedom, to let truth prevail, and to consolidate international cooperation and peace. In the past, there were ancient relations of cooperation and friendship between us, and today we are linked not only by traditional friendship, but also by our agreement to faithfully adhere to the principles adopted by the Bandung Conference, because our common political and economic interests lie in getting rid of the military and economic control of the colonialists, and because we are sincerely concerned about the future of mankind and the prospects for peace.
    After the Bandung Conference made its resolutions, it was expected—or rather hoped—that the colonialists would regain their senses, that the colonialists would carefully consider their situation. It was expected—or rather hoped—that the colonialists would realize that the spirit upon which the Bandung Conference's resolutions were based did not harbor malice towards any individual or collective, but a spirit of friendship, a spirit of mutual encouragement with kindness, cooperation, fraternity, and peace. However, the colonialists did not realize this or did not want to realize this. They bombed unarmed peaceful residents in Yemen and the occupied territories, destroyed homes, and violated human rights. We swear to Allah that we will continue to work hard, sparing no sacrifice of our most precious things, until these occupied territories return to the embrace of their great mother—Yemen. The colonialists continue this brutality in the rest of Asia and Africa. They have begun to reorganize their ranks, which is manifested in their barbaric aggression against those who are fighting for power and freedom, in their blatant support for oppression and aggression. They are actively competing to establish and consolidate aggressive military alliances and war bases to intimidate free people and persecute defenders of peace.
    But we who believe in the Bandung principles have not been intimidated by the colonialists' methods. The means used by warmongers and war-profiteers have not stopped us from continuing to move forward on the right path: dedicating ourselves to the liberation of all peoples, strengthening mutual understanding among people, and laying peace on a sound foundation.
    Our path is not to provoke hostility and hatred among peoples and collectives based on prejudices in ideology, religion, ethnicity, color, or any other aspect. Our path is not to violate power and freedom. Our path is to promote mutual understanding among people, to achieve fraternity and cooperation, and to stabilize human peace. This is the path for all peoples to prosperity.
    Today, the people of Yemen and China are visiting each other to strengthen inherent ties to achieve these goals and achieve better mutual understanding. This will help the friendly exchanges, economic mutual benefit, and cooperation in culture and art between the two peoples. I am deeply convinced that this mutual understanding is the first and most effective step in consolidating Afro-Asian solidarity and realizing the aspirations of all peoples.
    The people of the East, in their ancient beliefs, consider mutual encouragement with kindness, friendship, and peace as an invincible force. In this visit, I am honored to re-encourage each other with these principles, looking forward to a happy future filled with kindness, friendship, and peace for our brotherly two peoples and the peoples of the world. I pray to Allah to let us enjoy the grace of friendly cooperation for a long time, and to cooperate permanently in promoting truth and realizing universal prosperity, security, and peace.
    To the health of His Excellency Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and His Excellency Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council, and to the consolidated friendship between Yemen and China, Cheers!

### 巴德尔王太子的讲话

专栏：

    巴德尔王太子的讲话总理先生阁下：
    我向阁下表示最美好的谢意，感谢您的热情的友好欢迎和盛情的款待，并且对您和你们的英雄的古老民族的人民向我和我的同伴以及你们的兄弟也门人民所表示的兄弟般的深厚感情表示最大的愉快。
    我很愿意告诉您：也门和整个阿拉伯世界是怎样的称颂您和中国人民在亚非各国人民的问题上特别是阿拉伯世界的问题上所采取的立场。您积极地建设性地参与万隆会议的工作，这对会议的成功和各项原则的通过起了显著的良好作用，这些原则保证了解决革命的亚非两洲的问题和普遍和平的问题。
    在阿拉伯人遭到侵略的时候，特别是在埃及遭到背信弃义的侵略的灾难日子里，你们都曾奋起保卫阿拉伯人，这在阿拉伯世界全体人民和保卫自由和平的人们的心里留下了最良好的印象，由于你们的这种立场，亚非团结已经由一种理想和乐观者的愿望变成了活生生的现实。
    阿拉伯人现在正以非常愉快的心情注视着中国代表团在开罗亚非团结大会上的活动，他们从中国代表团的活动里清楚地看出中国是决心勇往直前地保卫自由，让真理抬头，巩固国际合作和和平。过去，我们之间有过合作和友好的古老关系，而今天我们不仅是由于传统的友谊联系在一起，而且也是由于我们约定共同忠实于万隆会议所通过的各项原则，由于我们一致的政治利益和经济利益是在于摆脱殖民主义者的军事的和经济的控制，也是由于我们衷心地关怀着人类的未来和和平的前途。
    在万隆会议作出决议以后，本来预料着——或者说是希望着殖民主义者会恢复理智，殖民主义者会很好地考虑自己的处境，本来预料着——或者说是希望着殖民主义者会认识到万隆会议的各项决议所依据的精神对某一个人或某一集体并不蕴藏着恶意，而是一种友好精神，是一种以善良、合作、博爱与和平来相互鼓励的精神，但是殖民主义者没有认识或者是不想认识这一点，他们对也门和被占地区的徒手的和平居民进行轰炸，毁坏了家园和侵犯人权。我们向真主发誓：我们将继续努力，不惜牺牲我们的一切最宝贵的东西，直到这些被占地区回到它的伟大的母亲——也门的怀抱里。殖民主义者在亚非其余地区继续着这种残暴行为，他们又开始整顿队伍，这表现在他们野蛮地对争取权力和自由而进行斗争的人们进行侵略，表现在明目张胆地支持压迫和侵略，他们竞相积极地建立并巩固侵略性军事同盟和战争基地用来威吓自由的人们迫害和平的保卫者。
    但是相信万隆原则的我们并没有被殖民主义者的手段吓倒，战争叫嚣者和战争贩子们所施的手段并没有挡住我们在正确的道路上继续前进：致力于解放各国人民，加强人们的相互了解，把和平奠定在健全的基础上。
    我们的道路不是在人民与人民之间，集体与集体之间挑起以意识形态、宗教、种族、肤色等任何方面的偏见为基础的敌意和仇恨。我们的道路也不是侵犯权力和自由，我们的道路是促进人民之间的相互了解，实现博爱与合作，稳定人类和平。这是各国人民走上繁荣的道路。
    今天，我们也、中两国人民相互访问通过加强固有的联系来实现这些目的，达成更良好的相互了解，这样会有助于两国人民的友好往来、经济互利以及文化艺术方面的合作，我深信相互间的这种了解是巩固亚非团结、实现各国人民愿望的第一个步骤，也是最有效的步骤。
    东方人民在他们的古代信仰中就认为以善良、友爱、和平来相互鼓励是一种不可战胜的力量，我在这次访问中很荣幸地重新用这些原则来相互鼓励，展望着我们兄弟般的两国人民和全世界人民的充满着善良、友爱、和平的幸福未来，我祈求真主使我们长期享受友好合作的恩典，在发扬真理，实现普遍的繁荣、安全与和平方面永久合作。
    为中华人民共和国主席毛泽东阁下和国务院总理周恩来阁下的健康，为也门和中国巩固的友谊，干杯！
