    Butterfly Loves Flowers
    (To Li Shuyi)
    Mao Zedong
    I lost my proud Yang, you lost your Liu,
    The willows gently flutter, soaring to the highest heavens.
    Inquiring what Wu Gang has to offer?
    Wu Gang presents osmanthus wine.
    Lonely Chang'e extends her broad sleeves,
    Across the vast sky, dancing for the loyal souls.
    Suddenly, news arrives that tigers have been subdued in the world,
    Tears fall, instantly turning into a torrential rain.

    [Editor's Note] This poem was written by Comrade Mao Zedong on May 11, 1957, to Comrade Li Shuyi, a Chinese language teacher at Changsha Tenth Middle School in Hunan. "Liu" in the poem refers to Martyr Liu Zhixun, Comrade Li Shuyi's husband. He was an old comrade-in-arms of Comrade Mao Zedong, joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1923, and served as a member of the Hunan Provincial Government and Secretary-General of the Hunan Provincial Farmers' Association. He participated in the Nanchang Uprising and sacrificed his life in the Honghu battle in Hubei in September 1933. "Proud Yang" refers to Martyr Yang Kaihui. She was killed by the reactionary He Jian in 1930 after the Red Army withdrew from Changsha. She was a good friend of Comrade Li Shuyi.

    蝶恋花
    （赠李淑一）
    毛泽东    
    我失骄杨君失柳，
    杨柳轻飏，直上重霄九。
    问讯吴刚何所有？
    吴刚捧出桂花酒。
    寂寞嫦娥舒广袖，
    万里长空，且为忠魂舞。
    忽报人间曾伏虎，
    泪飞顿作倾盆雨。
    〔编者注〕这首词是毛泽东同志在1957年5月11日写给湖南长沙第十中学语文教员李淑一同志的。词中“柳”是指李淑一同志的爱人柳直荀烈士，他是毛泽东同志的老战友，1923年加入中国共产党，曾任湖南省政府委员，湖南省农民协会秘书长，参加过南昌起义，1933年9月在湖北洪湖战役中牺牲。“骄杨”是指杨开慧烈士。她在1930年红军退出长沙后，为反动派何键杀害。她是李淑一同志的好朋友。
