Shuangshili Village Mountains and Forests Have Been Free from Disasters for a Century

(Reported by this newspaper) The large areas of forest managed by Shuangshili Village, Xiaqian Township, Jianyang County, Fujian Province, have not experienced a single mountain forest fire for nearly a hundred years.

This village is located in a remote mountain area with abundant forest reserves. The entire village of fifteen households earned 5,180 yuan last year from logging, tea, tung oil, dried bamboo shoots, and other forest by-products, accounting for 63.6% of the total production income. Forestry income has always accounted for the main part of the village's national economic income, so the masses attach particular importance to forest protection and fire prevention work. The elders often warn the young people: "The mountains and forests are our rice bowl. If we eat from the mountains, we must nurture the mountains. We must never lose this golden rice bowl." Future generations have also remembered these lessons, and even children who are just beginning to understand things are given education in forest protection and fire prevention, and children are strictly prohibited from playing with fire. In 1956, when burning wasteland for cultivation, someone accidentally set the weeds on fire. Upon hearing the news, the villagers immediately rushed to rescue it and quickly put out the flames. When mountain forest fires occurred in neighboring areas, they also actively helped to rescue them, so fires never occurred.

The village's fire prevention experience is mainly "prevention is more important than cure, and pay attention to prevention at all times." In order to strictly control fire sources, the village has never burned field ridge grass and mountain slopes, but uses grass cutting instead; it is usually strictly forbidden to burn mountain flour and wild bees; at the same time, mountain refining is not carried out in long-term drought without rain. When refining mountains, wide firebreaks are opened in advance, fire-fighting tools are prepared, and sufficient personnel are on duty, especially during the fire-prone season. Recently, every household in the village has formulated a forest protection and fire prevention covenant, and fire prevention warning signs have been placed at intersections near the village, preparing to maintain the glorious title of "Village with a Century of Disaster-Free Mountains and Forests" for a long time.

    双狮历村山林百年无灾
    本报讯　福建建阳县下墘乡双狮历村经营的大片林木，近一百多年来，没有发生过一次山林火灾。
    这个村子座落在僻山之中，林木藏量很丰富。全村十五户，去年砍伐林木和茶叶、油桐、笋干等林副产品收入即达五千一百八十元，占生产总收入的63.6％。林业收入一向占该村国民经济收入的主要部分，因此群众对护林防火工作也就特别重视，老人们都常告诫年轻人：“山林就是我们的饭碗，吃山就得养山，决不能把这个金饭碗丢了。”后代人也都记着这些教训，对刚懂事的小孩子也进行护林防火的教育，严格禁止小孩玩火。1956年烧垦荒地时，有人不小心把荒草烧起来了，全村群众闻讯立刻赶往抢救，很快就把火苗扑灭了。邻区发生山林火灾时，他们也非常积极地去帮助抢救，因此从未酿成火灾。
    这个村的防火经验主要是“防重于治，随时注意防范”。为了严格控制火源，该村历来都不烧田埂草和山塝，而用劈草来代替；平时严格禁止烧山粉、烧野蜂等活动；同时不在久旱无雨的天气炼山，炼山时都预先开好宽大的防火路，准备好打火工具，并有足够的人员看守，特别是火灾盛行的季节更为注意。最近，该村家家户户又订出了护林防火公约，村旁路口插上防火警告牌，准备长久保持“山林百年无灾村”的光荣称号。
