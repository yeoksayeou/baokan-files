    Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 14th: Indonesia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Sastroamidjojo, wrote a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 13th, refuting the slanderous remarks spread by the Dutch Permanent Representative to the United Nations against Indonesia's anti-Dutch struggle, and pointing out the legitimacy and justice of this struggle.

    The Dutch Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Schurmann, wrote to Hammarskjöld on December 23, 1957, insisting that Indonesia's recent actions against the Netherlands were "illegal," and Schurmann also distributed this letter to the member states of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council.

    In his letter, Sastroamidjojo described the Dutch government's persistent refusal to negotiate the West Irian dispute with the assistance of the United Nations, and blocked all avenues for resolving the dispute through moderate means. He said that since the United Nations has closed its doors to us, the Indonesian government has clearly had no choice but to take other measures to end the intolerable situation of a part of Indonesian territory continuing to be occupied by foreign countries.

    Sastroamidjojo pointed out that Indonesia is fully entitled to take measures against Dutch enterprises in Indonesia, because the Indonesian government has both general administrative power and the special power stipulated in the Indonesian Constitution to declare a state of emergency. The Indonesian government also took these measures in accordance with some laws formulated during the Dutch colonial rule, which remain in effect in Indonesia until they are replaced by its own laws.

    Sastroamidjojo pointed out that Indonesia has not nationalized any enterprises. The Indonesian government is only supervising Dutch enterprises to ensure that they continue to operate. In addition, some measures have been taken against Dutch banks and the Royal Dutch Shipping Company to prevent these banks from transferring gold and other property, and the Royal Dutch Shipping Company from transferring its ships to foreign countries, because these materials are absolutely necessary for the Indonesian national economy.

    He said that when the Indonesian government took these measures, it guaranteed not to infringe upon the human rights and freedoms of Dutch residents. The government has not ordered the mass expulsion of Dutch residents. He pointed out that only those unemployed Dutch people need to leave Indonesia, and other Dutch people who wish to leave Indonesia will also be facilitated. He said that Indonesia cannot accept the protests raised by the Netherlands. On the contrary, Indonesia must protest against the long-term illegal occupation of Indonesian territory by the Dutch occupation forces in West Irian.

    印度尼西亚反荷斗争是正义的
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约驳斥荷兰的诽谤
    新华社14日讯　纽约消息：印度尼西亚驻联合国常任代表沙斯特罗阿米佐约13日写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，驳斥了荷兰驻联合国常任代表所散布的对印度尼西亚反荷斗争的诽谤性言论，并且指出这一斗争的合法性与正义性。
    荷兰驻联合国常任代表舒尔曼曾经在1957年12月23日写信给哈马舍尔德，信上硬说印度尼西亚最近对荷兰所采取的行动是“非法”的，舒尔曼还把这封信分送给联合国大会和安全理事会的成员国。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约在信中叙述了荷兰政府坚持拒绝在联合国协助下就西伊里安争端进行谈判，并且堵塞了一切采取温和办法来解决这一争端的道路。他说，既然联合国已经对我们关起大门，印度尼西亚政府显然只好另外采取别的手段，来结束印度尼西亚的一部分领土继续被外国侵占这种令人不能容忍的局面。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约指出，印度尼西亚完全有权对荷兰在印度尼西亚的企业采取措施，因为印度尼西亚政府既有一般的行政权力，还有印度尼西亚宪法所规定的宣布国家处于紧急状态时的特殊的权力。印度尼西亚政府还根据荷兰殖民统治时期制订的一些法律来采取这些措施，这些法律在印度尼西亚以本国的法律代替它们以前仍然生效。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约指出，印度尼西亚并没有把任何企业实行国有化。印度尼西亚政府只是对荷兰企业实行监督，以保证它们继续进行工作。此外，对荷兰的一些银行和荷兰皇家轮船公司采取了一些措施，以防止这些银行把黄金和其他财产以及荷兰皇家轮船公司把它的船只转移到外国去，因为这些物资是印度尼西亚国民经济所绝对需要的。
    他说，印度尼西亚政府采取这些措施的时候，保证不侵犯荷兰侨民的人权和自由。政府也没有下令大规模驱逐荷兰侨民出境。他指出，只有那些没有职业的荷兰人需要撤离印度尼西亚，其他希望离开印度尼西亚的荷兰人也将得到方便。他说，印度尼西亚不能接受荷兰提出的抗议，相反地，印度尼西亚要对西伊里安的荷兰占领军长期非法侵占印度尼西亚领土这件事提出抗议。
