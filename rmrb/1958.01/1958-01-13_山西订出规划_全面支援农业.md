    Shanxi Province has formulated a plan to comprehensively support agricultural production and help farmers across the province catch up with and surpass the production level of well-to-do middle peasants within three to five years.
    In order to gradually realize agricultural mechanization, local industrial departments have decided to make full use of Shanxi's relatively developed machinery industry to gradually establish a manufacturing and repair system for agricultural machinery. They plan to expand several existing larger farm tool manufacturing plants to serve as agricultural machinery manufacturing centers, producing more than 170,000 pieces of larger agricultural machinery equipment during the Second Five-Year Plan period. In terms of power equipment, in light of Shanxi's abundant coal resources, they plan to manufacture more various types of gas engines, steam engines, and small electric motors. In terms of tillage implements, in addition to continuing to produce products that farmers have found suitable in the past, they are also preparing to trial-produce wheat threshers, potato harvesters, and hemp peeling machines. They will also provide concrete assistance to farmers in machine installation and the transmission of operating techniques.
    While manufacturing mechanical equipment, they also plan to designate several factories to manufacture a large number of easily worn general-purpose parts and other parts, according to the actual needs of various places, striving to gradually make it as convenient for farmers to buy machine parts as it is to buy nails for shoes.
    Specific arrangements have also been made for the repair of mechanical equipment. Complex, precision, and larger equipment will be repaired and fitted by the manufacturing plant and some factories with higher technical conditions; general mechanical equipment will be repaired by existing farm tool repair factories on a regional contract basis; and farm tools powered by labor and animal power will be repaired by small farm tool factories and handicraft cooperatives. They are also preparing to organize the machine repair workshops or machine repair sections of hundreds of enterprises to establish fixed ties with agricultural cooperatives near the enterprises to repair mechanical equipment for the agricultural cooperatives.
    In order to increase agricultural output, local industrial departments are also preparing to produce various chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The Shanxi Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, which is currently under construction, will be able to produce 200,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer annually after it is fully completed during the Second Five-Year Plan period. By that time, each mu of cultivated land in the province can be applied with six jin of phosphate fertilizer, which alone can increase grain production by 600 million jin. In addition, they are also preparing to expand bone fertilizer plants and peat plants. In terms of pesticides, they are preparing to further produce new varieties and continue to expand the production of 666 crude powder and ferrous sulfate.
    In terms of solving the problem of coal use for farmers, in addition to rebuilding and expanding some larger coal mines, more investment should be used to build small coal mines, especially to open small coal kilns in a planned and guided manner.
    According to the conditions in various places, it is necessary to actively develop the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products and local specialties. The Datong area will build a factory with an annual output of 25,000 tons of sugar, and support local farmers to plant a large amount of sugar beets by utilizing saline-alkali land. Jinzhong and Jinan areas will build one paper mill and one cardboard factory each, so as to make full use of wheat straw and cotton stalks that have always been burned by farmers. Various mountainous areas should build some fruit processing plants and egg processing plants to invigorate the mountain economy. Mountainous areas will also organize agricultural cooperatives in a planned way to exploit coal, iron, sulfur, gypsum, gold, copper, mica, asbestos and other minerals.

### 山西订出规划　全面支援农业

    山西订出规划　全面支援农业
    本报讯　山西省工业部门积极制订支援农业生产的计划，帮助全省农民在三、五年内赶上和超过富裕中农的生产水平。
    为了逐步实现农业机械化，地方工业部门决定充分利用山西机械工业比较发达的条件，逐步建立农业机械的修造体系。他们计划扩大原有几个较大的农具制造厂，作为农业机械的制造中心，在第二个五年计划期间生产较大的农业机械设备十七万多部。在动力设备方面，根据山西煤炭丰富的特点，计划多制造一些各种型号的煤气机、蒸汽机和小型电动机。在耕作机具方面，除继续生产过去农民认为适用的产品以外，还准备试制小麦脱粒机、薯类收割机、剥麻机等。在机器安装和传授操作技术方面，也将给农民以具体帮助。
    在制造机械设备的同时，还计划根据各地实际需要，指定几个工厂大量制造一些易于损耗的通用零件和其他零件，争取逐步作到农民购买机器零件就像钉鞋一样便利。
    关于机械设备的修理业务，也作了具体安排。复杂、精密、较大的设备，由承制厂和一些技术条件较高的工厂负责修配；一般机械设备，由现有农具修配厂分地区包干修配；以劳畜力为动力的农具，由小型农具厂和手工业社负责修配。他们还准备把数百个企业的机修车间或机修工段组织起来，同企业附近的农业社建立固定的联系，为农业社修理机械设备。
    为了提高农业产量，地方工业部门还准备生产各种化学肥料和杀虫药剂。仅正在建设的山西磷肥厂，在第二个五年计划期间全部建成以后，就可年产磷肥二十万吨。到那时候，全省耕地面积每亩可以施磷肥六斤，只此一项，即可增产粮食六亿斤。另外还准备扩建骨肥厂、泥炭厂。农药方面，准备进一步生产新品种，继续扩大六六六原粉和绿矾的生产。
    在解决农民用煤方面，除改建和扩建一些较大的煤矿外，要用更多的投资建设小煤矿，特别要有计划有领导地开放小煤窑。
    根据各地条件，要积极发展农副业和土特产的加工工业。大同地区将新建一座年产二万五千吨糖的工厂，扶植当地农民利用盐硷地大量种植甜菜。晋中、晋南地区将新建造纸厂和纸版厂各一座，以便充分利用当地历来被农民烧毁的麦秸、棉杆。山区各地要新建一些果品加工厂和蛋品加工厂，以活跃山区经济。山区还将有计划地组织农业社开采煤、铁、硫磺、石膏、金、铜、云母、石棉等矿产。
