    A Children's Ice Rink
    Guo An
    On the moat behind the Palace Museum, there is an ice rink belonging to the Beijing Children's Palace, with an area of only five thousand square meters. It opens at 2 PM every day, and groups of children pour into the rink.
    On the smooth ice, groups of Young Pioneers are happily spending their team day. Some are speeding across the ice, while beginners are wobbling around with the guidance and support of their friends. From time to time, you can see Young Pioneers, led by counselors and teachers, forming a long line, playing the game of "The Eagle Catches the Chicks."
    More than a month ago, the staff of the Jingshan Children's Palace were considering how to meet the children's needs for recreational and sports activities, and they unanimously agreed to build a Children's Palace ice rink on the moat behind the Palace Museum. After preliminary calculations showed that hiring someone to build the ice rink would cost at least 300 yuan, they finally decided to do it themselves. They bought some necessary equipment, borrowed some bamboo poles and wooden boards from the Beijing Fifth Construction Engineering Company, and after several days of hard work, they built the ice rink for just over 100 yuan. The children didn't have ice skates, and buying a pair would cost more than 10 yuan, so they bought a batch of wooden boards, wire, and rope, and made 300 pairs of wooden skates, solving the children's problem of not having skates. They also borrowed a small wooden kiosk from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Parks and Woods as an office for selling tickets and renting skates.
    The Children's Palace ice rink receives four or five hundred children every day on weekdays, and more than a thousand children come to skate on Saturdays and Sundays. However, there are only three staff members at the ice rink, and they take care of the daily cleaning, tidying, renting, and repairing of the skates, selling tickets, and managing the ice rink.

    一个儿童冰场
    郭安
    在故宫博物院后门的护城河上，有一个北京少年宫冰场，它的面积只有五千平方公尺。每到下午两点以后，冰场就开放了，一群群少年儿童涌进冰场。
    在平滑的冰场上，成群的红领巾正在欢乐地过队日。他们有的在冰上飞驰着，初学的少年儿童在朋友们的指点、扶持下，摇摇晃晃地滑着；不时还可以看到在辅导员和老师的带领下，红领巾们组成了一排长长的行列，玩着“老鹰捉小鸡”的游戏。
    早在一个多月以前，景山少年宫的工作人员便考虑到怎样满足孩子们对文娱体育活动的要求，结果一致同意利用故宫后的护城河为孩子们修建一个少年宫冰场。经过初步计算，请外人修建冰场至少要三百元，最后决定自己动手。他们买了一些必要的设备，向北京市第五建筑工程公司租借了一些竹杆、木板，经过了几天的辛勤劳动，只花了一百多块钱就将冰场修起了。孩子们没有冰鞋，买一双又要十多元，他们就买了一批木板、铁丝、绳子，制成了三百双木板冰鞋，解决了孩子们没有冰鞋的困难。他们还向北京市园林局借了一个小木亭作为卖票、出租冰鞋的办公室。
    少年宫冰场平日每天要接待四、五百名小朋友，在星期六、日前来滑冰的少年儿童有一千多人。可是冰场的工作人员只有三人，他们包办了每天的冰场收拾、整理、出租、修理冰鞋、卖票和冰场的管理工作。
