    Good towels are not only bright in color, soft, and absorbent, but also strong and durable. How to identify the quality of a towel?

    We can distinguish between good and bad towels based on the cotton yarn used and the weaving method of the towel:

    The cotton yarn used for weaving towels comes in two types: finished yarn and raw yarn. Finished yarn is better than raw yarn. Finished yarn has been boiled in alkaline water to remove cotton grease and impurities, and then sized. Therefore, towels woven with this type of yarn are both beautiful and durable. When buying towels, we can touch them with our hands. Those that are smooth and soft are made of finished yarn, while those that are stiff and rough are made of raw yarn. You can also slowly drip a cup of clean water from a height onto the towel. If the water droplets are absorbed immediately, it is a finished yarn towel; if the water droplets float on the surface and are gradually absorbed, it is a raw yarn towel.

    When purchasing towels, also pay attention to the number of loops. More loops indicate better quality. The loops on a towel are the wide yarns that pass through the squares formed by the warp and weft yarns. A "single loop" is formed by passing one yarn to create one loop; a "double loop" is formed by passing two wide yarns to create two loops; and a "triple loop" is formed by passing three wide yarns to create three loops. More loops are better than fewer loops, and double-sided multi-loop towels are better than single-sided single-loop towels.

    How long can a towel be used? This is related to the quality of the towel; however, proper use and storage can also extend the towel's lifespan.

    For example, if the towel is rinsed with clean water and then dried after wiping sweat or face, it can remove the corrosive effect of sweat on the towel. When washing towels, use only your hands to rub them. Do not use a brush or washboard to scrub them hard, to prevent damage to the fibers and loops. If a towel is purchased but not used immediately, it is best to soak it in clean water, dry it, and then store it. (Sheng)

### 哪样的毛巾好？怎样使毛巾耐用？

    哪样的毛巾好？怎样使毛巾耐用？
    好的毛巾不仅色泽光洁、柔软、吸水力大，而且结实耐用。怎样识别毛巾的好坏呢？
    我们可以根据毛巾所用的棉纱和毛巾的织法来鉴别：
    织毛巾用的棉纱，有熟纱和生纱两种。熟纱的比生纱的好。熟纱是用碱水煮过，脱除了棉脂和杂质，再上了浆的，所以这种纱织成的毛巾既好看又耐用。我们买毛巾的时候用手摸一摸，凡是光洁柔软的，就是熟纱的，凡是僵硬扎手的，就是生纱的。也可以用一杯清水从高处慢慢滴到毛巾上，如果水珠马上被吸收，就是熟纱毛巾；如果水珠浮在上面，逐渐被吸收的，就是生纱毛巾。
    选购毛巾的时候，还要注意毛圈的多少。毛圈多的质量好。毛巾上的毛圈，是在经纬纱相交的方眼中穿过的宽纱。穿过一根纱起一个毛圈的，叫“单毛圈”；穿过两根宽纱起两个毛圈的，叫“双毛圈”；穿过三根宽纱起三个毛圈的，叫“三毛圈”。毛圈多的，比毛圈少的好，双面多毛圈的毛巾比单面单毛圈的毛巾好。
    一条毛巾能使用多久？这和毛巾的质量好坏有关系；但是，使用和保管得当，也可延长毛巾的使用时间。
    比如说，毛巾在擦汗、擦脸之后，如用清水洗过再晾，可以除去汗对毛巾的腐蚀作用。洗毛巾时，只能用手搓，不能用刷子或搓板硬搓，以防损坏纤维和毛头。如果毛巾买来暂时不用，最好用清水泡洗、晾干，然后再放起来。（生）
