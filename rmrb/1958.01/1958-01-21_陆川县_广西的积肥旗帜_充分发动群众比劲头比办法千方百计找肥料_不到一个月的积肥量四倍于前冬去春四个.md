Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 19th: Farmers in Luchuan County, Guangxi Province, are seeking fertilizer sources by every possible means, and a vigorous manure accumulation campaign involving thousands of carts and ten thousands of loads is unfolding throughout the county. From December 14th last year to January 12th this year, the county accumulated a total of more than 55.35 million dan of fertilizer, equivalent to four times the total amount accumulated during the four months from the previous winter to last spring, averaging 148 dan of fertilizer that can be applied per mu.

Luchuan County plans to produce an average of 800 jin of grain per mu this year, requiring an average application of 200 dan of fertilizer per mu throughout the year. This advanced plan has become a tremendous force to inspire cadres and commune members. Since the mobilization meetings held in various districts and townships from the middle of last month, people have been accumulating fertilizer in the rural areas of the county, whether day or night. Currently, 140,000 people participate in manure accumulation and water conservancy construction every day. The amount of accumulated fertilizer increases by several million dan every day.

In order to open up fertilizer sources, the Luchuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the manure accumulation policy of "exhausting all means to explore fertilizer sources, focusing on the big picture, starting with the small, and striving to solve the fertilizer problem ourselves." Various agricultural cooperatives mobilized older farmers to offer suggestions and the masses to report fertilizer sources, adopting various methods such as seeking fertilizer from the mountains, from people and livestock, from the fields, from underground, from underwater, and from inside houses, to explore fertilizer sources. Many commune members, in order to find fertilizer, also climbed mountains and waded through rivers, not shying away from hard work. Qiu Qingnan, a Communist Party member of the Beidou Agricultural Cooperative, and others visited fourteen or fifteen older farmers in three days, finding many fertilizer sources, including ten ancient ponds, seven old riverbeds, containing hundreds of thousands of dan of fertile mud. The Luyin Agricultural Cooperative formed a fertilizer prospecting team composed of five Communist Party members including Lai Qingzhang and Lai Deren, to search for fertilizer in the mountains, forests, and river bends of the entire township. In less than a month, the county found seventy or eighty kinds of fertilizer sources, and many fertilizer sources that had long been forgotten, such as the mud from ancient ponds, the soot from the roofs, and the charcoal ash from the cooperatives, were all explored and utilized. Commune members also handed over the pig manure, chicken manure, and duck manure that they had stored in their homes for many years to the cooperatives.

At the beginning of the manure accumulation campaign, some cadres and masses had serious right-leaning conservative ideas. The Luchuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately organized forces to create a model in the ?tang Agricultural Cooperative, accumulating more than 100,000 dan of fertilizer in five days and five nights. Then, cadres above the level of production team leader of agricultural cooperatives were organized to visit and learn, which enhanced everyone's confidence. Challenges quickly unfolded between districts, between cooperatives, and between teams, comparing enthusiasm, methods, and plans. Cadres of various districts and cooperatives also went deep into a production team according to the requirements of the county committee, creating a model, and then organized the production teams within the cooperative to visit and learn, using local concrete facts to criticize the so-called "regional specificity" thinking. In the climax of manure accumulation, various districts and townships used methods such as mutual visits, inspections, evaluations, and competitions to keep the masses' enthusiasm for manure accumulation high.
  This newspaper reports: The Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a notice to local committees on January 14th, requiring localities to organize a large-scale visiting group of more than 2,000 people, including county party secretaries or deputy secretaries, heads or deputy heads of county rural work departments, county agricultural section chiefs, and district, township, and cooperative cadres, and manure accumulation models, to visit Luchuan County, the province's banner in manure accumulation work. After the visit, the Guangxi Provincial Committee will hold a fertilizer work conference on the spot to fully exchange experiences, improve manure accumulation techniques, mobilize the masses, tap manure accumulation potential, open up fertilizer sources, and quickly launch a province-wide, nationwide manure accumulation upsurge following the water conservancy upsurge, to ensure a great leap forward in agricultural production this year and strive to achieve the target of 800 jin per mu as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

The Guangxi Daily published the experience of Luchuan County in carrying out a mass manure accumulation campaign in large portions of the newspaper on January 16th and published an editorial titled "Flag Bearer of the Provincial Manure Accumulation Upsurge," calling on all parts of the province to learn from the revolutionary drive of Luchuan County, mobilize and rely on the masses to solve the fertilizer problem, and criticize the right-leaning conservative thinking of "exhausted fertilizer sources and no fertilizer to accumulate."

    陆川县——广西的积肥旗帜
    充分发动群众比劲头比办法千方百计找肥料
    不到一个月的积肥量四倍于前冬去春四个月
    新华社南宁19日电　广西省陆川县农民千方百计寻找肥源，千车万担的积肥运动在全县热烈地展开。从去年12月14日到今年1月12日，全县共积肥五千五百三十五万多担，相当于前年冬季到去年春季四个月积肥总量的四倍，平均每亩地可以施肥一百四十八担。
    陆川县计划今年每亩地平均产八百斤粮食，要求每亩地全年平均下肥二百担。这个先进的计划，成为鼓舞干部和社员的巨大力量。从上月中旬各区、乡分别举行动员大会以来，全县农村不管是白天或黑夜，都有人在积肥。现在全县每天有十四万人参加积肥和兴修水利。积肥量每天都上升几百万担。
    为了开辟肥源，中共陆川县委提出了“想尽一切办法挖掘肥源，从大处着眼、小处着手、争取自己解决肥料问题”的积肥方针。各农业社发动老年农民献计、群众报肥源，采取向山上要肥，向人畜要肥，向田里要肥，向地下要肥，向水底要肥，向屋内要肥等多种办法，挖掘肥源。很多社员为了找肥料，还攀山涉水，不辞辛劳。北豆农业社共产党员丘庆南等在三天内，访问了十四、五个老年农民，找到了许多肥源，其中有古塘十个，旧河床七处，藏有肥泥几十万担。陆因农业社由赖清章、赖德仁等五个共产党员专门组成一个肥料勘察队，到全乡的山林河湾，找寻肥料。不到一月，全县共找出肥源七、八十种，湮没已久的古塘泥、屋顶上的煤烟，社里的炭灰等许多平日想不到的肥源，都被挖掘利用了。社员们还把自己家里贮存多年的猪粪、鸡鸭粪交给社里。
    在积肥运动开始的时候，有些干部和群众曾经有严重的右倾保守思想。中共陆川县委就立即组织力量，到?塘农业社创造了五天五夜积肥十万多担的典范。然后组织农业社生产队长以上的干部前往参观，使大家提高了信心。区与区、社与社、队与队之间很快便展开了挑战，互相比劲头、比办法和比计划。各区各社的干部还根据县委的要求，深入一个生产队，创造出典型，然后组织社内的生产队来参观，用本地的具体事实，批判所谓“地区特殊”的思想。在积肥高潮中，各区、乡又通过相互参观、检查、评比、竞赛等办法，使群众的积肥情绪一直饱满。
  本报讯　中共广西省委在1月14日向各地委发出通知，要求各地组织包括县委书记或副书记、县委农村工作部部长或副部长、县农业科长及区、乡、社干部、积肥模范共二千多人的大规模参观团，到全省的积肥旗帜——陆川县参观积肥工作。参观后，广西省委将就地召开肥料工作会议，充分交流经验，改进积肥技术，发动群众，挖掘积肥潜力，开辟肥源，尽快在全省范围内掀起一个全民性的、继水利高潮之后的积肥高潮，保证今年农业生产大跃进，争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的亩产八百斤的指标。
    广西日报1月16日以大量的篇幅刊登陆川县开展群众性积肥运动的经验，并以“全省积肥高潮的旗手”为题发表社论，号召全省各地学习陆川县的革命干劲，发动和依靠群众解决肥料问题，批判“肥源枯竭、无肥可积”的右倾保守思想。
