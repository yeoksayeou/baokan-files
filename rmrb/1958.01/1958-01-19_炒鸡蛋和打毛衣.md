    Stir-fried Eggs and Knitting Sweaters
    Tian Li, Beijing Library

    Our female comrades often talk about cooking and preparing dishes. In these conversations, some say, "All I can do is stir-fry eggs and knit sweaters!" Others complain, "It's so annoying, Sundays are so busy, I end up smelling like oil all over, like a 'housewife'!" Some complain, "I started the stove twice, and my hands are already chapped." etc.

    Comrades who say such things may be very capable in their work. However, it seems they treat stir-frying eggs and knitting sweaters as "dabbling" when they are happy. Occasionally it's okay, but for a long time, it gets really annoying. Why are some people not ashamed of only knowing how to stir-fry eggs and knit sweaters, but rather feel honored? To say they are showing off their "noble" origins and "lofty" interests; to say they look down on housework as lowly, wouldn't be wrong!

    In fact, the social value created by housework is considerable. My neighbor is a car driver with a family of seven: husband and wife, four children, and an old lady, earning only eighty yuan a month. I calculated for them: if two children were sent to a nursery, the monthly fee would be more than forty yuan, plus clothing and pocket money, at least fifty yuan. The remaining thirty yuan would be used to maintain the livelihood of five people, which would not be enough in any case. But now, thanks to the housewife's careful care, everything is in order. The value of the housewife's labor per month is at least equivalent to more than sixty yuan. Although their family income is only eighty yuan, it is actually equivalent to one hundred and forty yuan. From an economic point of view alone, this kind of labor is very valuable, not to mention that the role of this housewife is not limited to the economic scope? Is this kind of hard work not worthy of respect?

    Marx's wife, Jenny, was very intelligent. With a lifetime of labor, she earned such an evaluation from Engels: "If there ever was a woman whose greatest happiness was to make others happy, that woman was she." Obviously, Marx's career and Jenny's were inseparable. The Communist Party liberated us women and opened up a vast world of labor for us, but it did not mean that we should despise housework. If one can only engage in social work and cannot do housework, I am afraid that one cannot be considered a complete laborer; being able to handle both wind and rain, that is the ability of a revolutionary.

    炒鸡蛋和打毛衣
    北京图书馆　田丽
    我们女同志常常在一块谈到烧饭、做菜的事，就在这种交谈中，有的说：“我只会炒鸡蛋和打毛衣！”有的说：“可讨厌死了，礼拜天真忙，弄得满身油味，像个‘家庭妇女’！”有的抱怨道：“我生了两次炉子，手就生刺了。”等等。
    说这样话的同志，在工作上也许是很有本事的。不过，看来她们是把炒鸡蛋和打毛衣当作高兴时的“玩票”，偶尔则可，长了，可就要讨厌死了。为什么有的人对于自己只会炒鸡蛋和打毛衣，不感到羞耻反而以为荣？说她们是在显示自己的出身“尊贵”，志趣“高尚”；说她们视家务劳动为轻贱，不会是冤枉吧！
    其实，家务劳动所创造的社会价值是很可观的。我的邻居是一位汽车司机，全家七口人，夫妻两，四个孩子，还有一个老太太，一个月只挣八十多元钱。我替他们算过：如果两个孩子送托儿所，每月托金就要四十多元，加上穿、零用，最少也要五十元。剩下的三十元，用来维持五口人的生计，无论如何是不够的了。可是现在，屋里屋外，憑着这位主妇的悉心照料，真是吃像吃，穿像穿。这位主妇一个月劳动的价值，最低相当于六十元以上。他们家虽只是八十元的收入，实际上，却等于一百四十元用。单从经济意义来说，这种劳动是很可贵的，何况这位主妇的作用又不止于经济范围呢？这种艰苦的劳动，难道是不值得尊重的吗？
    马克思的夫人燕妮是很有才智的，她以一生的劳动，获得了恩格斯的这样的评价：“倘若世上有过以使别人幸福为自己的最大幸福的妇人，那就是这妇人。”显然，马克思的事业和燕妮是分不开的。共产党解放我们妇女，给我们开辟了广阔的劳动天地，可并不是要我们轻视家务劳动。倘使只能从事社会工作，不能作家务劳动，恐怕不能算是完整的劳动者；既能风，又能雨，那才是革命者的本事。
