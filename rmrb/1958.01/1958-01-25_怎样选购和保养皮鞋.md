    How to Choose and Maintain Leather Shoes
    When you walk into a shoe store, you always hope to buy a pair of satisfactory leather shoes. However, there are many styles of leather shoes, and the prices vary. How do you choose? Here are some common sense tips for your reference when buying and using leather shoes.
    The leather shoes sold in stores are mainly pigskin leather shoes and cowhide leather shoes. Generally speaking, pigskin leather shoes are more durable than cowhide leather shoes, and the price is relatively cheaper; however, pigskin leather shoes have larger pores and are not as delicate and shiny as cowhide leather shoes.
    A good pair of leather shoes should meet the following requirements in terms of appearance quality:
    (1) The leather shoe upper should be free of obvious dark and light scars, the entire shoe upper should be bright in color, and there should be no cracking, sizing or discoloration. The surface of the sole should be shiny, free of cracks and scars, the groove should be neat, and there should be no defects such as broken exposed threads and a soft sole center.
    (2) The length and width of the two shoe soles should be exactly the same, and the length of the front upper and the height of the back upper must be consistent. The shoe upper and sole should be flat and free of skewing and deformation.
    (3) The main heel and the lower part of the inner toe cap should be hard, and there should be no softening phenomenon when pressed flat with a finger. The upper part should be soft and elastic, without a hard and foot-pinching phenomenon.
    (4) The shoe eye distance should be equal, the heel should be flat, the sewing stitches should be uniform, the nails should be neatly arranged, and the welt should be flat.
    (5) The shoe upper, shoe lining, and shoe sole should be clean and free of stains such as glue, paste, and grease.
    After buying a good pair of leather shoes, you should also pay attention to maintenance during use, otherwise they will be deformed after only a few months of wear. Pay attention to the following four points when maintaining leather shoes:
    (1) When wearing smooth leather shoes, you should often apply shoe polish (not too much each time), and then wipe them with a soft cloth after applying the polish. If they get soaked in water, do not wipe them with a cloth immediately. You should wait for them to dry in the shade, wipe them clean with a soft cloth, and then brush them with shoe polish and polish them.
    (2) Do not wash leather shoes with water. If they are dirty, wipe them clean with a soft cloth.
    (3) When storing, avoid contact with chemicals and high temperatures.
    (4) When leather shoes are damp, do not bake them with fire or expose them to the sun. They should be dried in a ventilated and dry place in the shade.

    怎样选购和保养皮鞋
    当你走进皮鞋商店的时候，你总希望能够买到一双称心如意的皮鞋。可是皮鞋的式样很多，价格高低不一，到底怎样挑选呢？这里介绍一些常识，供大家在购买和使用皮鞋时参考。
    目前商店里出售的皮鞋，主要是猪皮皮鞋和牛皮皮鞋两种。一般来讲：猪皮皮鞋比牛皮皮鞋耐穿，价格比较便宜；但是猪皮皮鞋毛孔粗大，不及牛皮皮鞋细致光亮。
    一双较好的皮鞋，它的外观质量应该达到下列要求：
    （一）皮鞋面无明暗伤痕，整个鞋邦色泽鲜艳，无裂面、掉浆脱色情况。鞋底表面要光亮，无裂面和伤痕，槽口整齐，无破裂露线和底心发软的缺点。
    （二）两只鞋底长短、肥瘦完全相等，前邦的长短及后邦的高矮必须一致。鞋邦、鞋底平整无歪斜变形的现象。
    （三）主跟和内包头下部坚硬，以手指平压无发软现象，上部柔软有弹力，无坚硬卡脚的现象。
    （四）鞋眼距离相等，后跟平正，缝纫针码均匀，钉钉整齐，沿条平正。
    （五）鞋邦、鞋里、鞋底应洁净无胶水、浆糊、油腊等污点。
    买到一双好皮鞋以后，在使用过程中还要注意保养，否则穿不到几个月，就会变形走样。保养皮鞋应注意下面四点：
    （一）穿着光面皮鞋时应经常擦鞋油（每次不宜过多），上油后再用软布擦亮。如遇水浸，不要当时就用布去擦，应待其阴干后，用软布擦净，再刷鞋油、打亮。
    （二）不要用水洗刷皮鞋，如遇污脏时，可用软布擦净。
    （三）放置时，应避免接近化学药品及高温处。
    （四）皮鞋潮湿时，不得用火烘烤或暴日晒，应放通风干燥处阴干。
