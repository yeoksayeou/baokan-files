Continue to Promote the "Hundred Schools of Thought"
Wu Chuanqi

The Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," which has brought a new atmosphere to our cultural, scientific, and artistic circles. Practice has proven that the Party's policy has a significant positive effect on promoting the development of our socialist culture, science, and art.

The Party's policy is a long-term policy, a policy for developing socialism. However, the realization of this policy, like the development of any matter, advances in a wave-like manner and grows in struggle. The bourgeois rightists once used the slogan "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" to oppose the Party and socialism. They once stirred up a dark cloud in our sunny spring.

The bourgeois rightists once adopted such a tactic: they described the guidance of Marxism, the leadership of the Party, and the socialist road as dogmatism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism, etc., and then declared to the people that "dogmatism," etc., "hindered" the airing of views. They used this method to only allow poisonous weeds to bloom alone and rightists to speak alone, but not to allow a hundred flowers to bloom and a hundred schools of thought to contend.

Therefore, although the rightists once waved the banner of "great airing of views," what truly hindered the airing of views was not their so-called "dogmatism," but the rightists themselves. The victory of the anti-rightist struggle not only cleared away this "hindrance" for the "hundred schools of thought," but also demarcated the lines of right and wrong, thereby creating more favorable conditions for the "hundred schools of thought"; it not only further developed the form of "great airing, great contending," but also expanded this form from academic life to political life, thereby creating a new form of socialist democracy with great airing, great contending, and great debate.

The rightists also used the slogan of "independent thinking" to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and oppose Marxism. They demanded that people's thinking be "independent" outside the socialist road, serving the restoration of capitalism.

In fact, only Marxists truly advocate independent thinking, because Marxism is a science that requires people to engage in independent thinking. Lenin once said: "On any serious issue, it is impossible to find the truth without considerable independent effort." Therefore, true independent thinking is of course scientific thinking, dialectical materialist thinking; thus, independent thinking itself also means a complete break with all idealism, clericalism, and fideism, and liberation from these superstitions. In other words, the true meaning of independent thinking lies in breaking down idealist superstitions and developing the science of dialectical materialism. However, the rightists advocate "independent thinking" in exactly the opposite way; they use it to oppose science, to hinder progress, and to resist development.

What we advocate as "independent thinking" is a realistic and truth-seeking, scientific and materialistic approach to learning. Since we have a common political standard on major issues of right and wrong, and a common good desire for the development of science, then this kind of academic debate—the debate between this opinion and that opinion, including the debate between idealism and materialism, the debate between bourgeois viewpoints and proletarian viewpoints—will always seek to make right and wrong tend towards consistency, achieve the purpose of improving understanding and promoting science. In the final analysis, there is only one standard of objective truth. A frog at the bottom of a well cannot see the vastness of the sky and earth; from the top of Mount Tai, one sees the smallness of the state of Lu. However, there is only one size of heaven and earth. If we do not go through this path of "independent thinking" and free debate, we cannot make science continue to develop, and we cannot make understanding continue to improve. Moreover, old right and wrong tend to be consistent, and new disputes will emerge; the development of science is a process of uninterrupted upward movement.

In short, the victory of the anti-rightist struggle has created more favorable conditions and opened up a better prospect for our academic "hundred schools of thought."

Marxism believes that academics cannot be separated from politics, especially in the departments of philosophy and social sciences. Therefore, in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao put forward six common political standards suitable for all scientific and artistic activities to help various free discussions move along the correct track. However, this is by no means simply treating academic issues and political issues as the same thing.

This is because, first of all, the six political standards put forward by Chairman Mao are common standards for all scientific and artistic activities. However, they are not the only standards for all scientific and artistic departments. Each scientific and artistic department also has "some of its own standards" ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People"). Secondly, it is often an inevitable process for the ideological transformation of some intellectuals for a person to accept socialism politically, but still retain bourgeois views academically. In this case, academic errors do not simultaneously have reactionary political tendencies. Of course, in social sciences and literature and art, if a person opposes the Party and socialism politically, then his academic views will inevitably be wrong.

The contradiction between the bourgeois rightists and the people is a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. However, within the people, the debate between bourgeois and proletarian viewpoints in academics, and the debate between idealism and materialism, belong to the contradictions among the people. Academic issues and political issues are both related and very different, and we should not confuse academic issues with political issues.

However, some rightists are also trying to confuse the public by reversing right and wrong on this issue. Some rightists describe their anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds as merely academic debates, and not as political issues opposing socialism. However, facts speak louder than words, and their tricks cannot cover the eyes and ears of the people. The words and deeds of the rightists happen to have no academic flavor at all, but are precisely opposing the Party and socialism on fundamental political issues. They are only acting in the name of academics, while actually engaging in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. From the fallacies of the so-called "bicameral system," "rehabilitation committee," and "Party-dominated world" to Ge Peiqi's demand to "kill communists"; from Zhang Naiqi's fallacies that "fixed interest is not exploitation" and "the bourgeoisie has no dual nature" to Xu Maoyong's "do not be afraid of undemocratic" "martyrdom" theory; from the rightists' "scientific program" to those restoration theories of bourgeois social science, etc., we cannot find any real academic issues, let alone their sinister activities of "planning in secret rooms" and "igniting at the grassroots." It can be seen that the reason why they became bourgeois rightists is not because they made mistakes on academic issues, but because they opposed the Party and socialism, and resolutely opposed the people on fundamental political issues and alienated themselves from the people. We must expose this trick of the rightists to confuse the public.

On the other hand, we have never simply treated errors on academic issues as political issues. Many people have shown erroneous views to varying degrees on academic issues, and some have even shown strong idealism and bourgeois views, but they have not been treated as bourgeois rightists. Moreover, many of them have shown a positive political attitude in the anti-rightist struggle, showing that they support the leadership of the Party and the socialist road. These facts show that we treat academic issues differently from political issues. As long as there are commonly recognized standards in politics, then even if there is a sharp opposition between bourgeois and proletarian viewpoints on academic issues, it is only an academic debate among the people. And academic issues can only gradually achieve the purpose of distinguishing right from wrong through repeated and meticulous free discussions.

Of course, the debate between this view and that view on academic issues often manifests the debate between different class viewpoints; but there are also debates that do not belong to the above nature. However, the distinction between issues among the people and issues between ourselves and the enemy in politics does not depend on a person's academic views, but on whether they oppose the Party and socialism on fundamental points, whether they resolutely resist transformation, and whether they resolutely oppose the people.

Therefore, there is a difference between academic issues and political issues. Academic errors cannot be simply equated with political issues; and political reaction cannot be said to be an academic issue. After the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, these boundaries are more clearly understood by the people. This has brought more favorable conditions for us to further carry out the academic "hundred schools of thought."

The difference between academic issues and political issues has been described above. However, some people are not yet accustomed to free academic discussions and mutual debates. Therefore, some people have some concerns: they are afraid of releasing wrong views and being seized by the pigtails and criticized. Obviously, these concerns are superfluous and not good for the development of science and personal progress.

A person's academic viewpoint is often not easy to distinguish as correct or wrong until it has been put forward for debate. Therefore, if you are afraid of making mistakes and do not put forward your own views, you may bury correct views as well. Moreover, even if wrong views are published, debate is also conducive to correcting mistakes and obtaining the truth. It is impossible to achieve the purpose of avoiding mistakes by hiding one's views. The scientific attitude should be based on the attitude of adhering to the truth and correcting mistakes; boldly put forward one's own views and move forward in debate. Some people think that their Marxist level is not high and they should wait until they have learned Marxism well before airing their views and contending. We believe that it is of course good to have the desire to study Marxism. But who has a high level of Marxism and who has a low level of Marxism needs to be reflected in the process of contention. And for studying Marxism, one can only learn well by participating in the practice of struggle; and participating in contention itself is the best way to study Marxism.

Of course, wrong views should be criticized. However, it is not easy to distinguish whether a certain view is correct or wrong until it has been put forward for debate. Even if it is a wrong view, criticism will only bring benefits to oneself. So the question is how people view this academic discussion and criticism. The so-called "hundred schools of thought" of course means that there is freedom to "air" and freedom to "contend" in academics; there is freedom to criticize and freedom to counter-criticize; there is freedom to publish bourgeois viewpoints for debate, and there is freedom to criticize these viewpoints. Whether this criticism is directed at oneself or at others, we should welcome and participate in it from a positive perspective, and not be afraid of it from a negative perspective. Everything correct is not afraid of criticism. Marxism is a scientific truth and is not afraid of criticism. Truth is not afraid of debate, and true gold is not afraid of fire. It is precisely because of this that Marxists advocate "hundred schools of thought," unlike the rightists, who only allow their own family to speak alone. On the other hand, as long as people do not persist in errors, they should not be afraid of criticism of their erroneous views. Only when people put forward their views without any worries, and clarify what is correct and what is wrong in the discussion, will it be more conducive to correcting mistakes and improving understanding. In our political life, we need this constant criticism and self-criticism; in academic research, we also need to create this new atmosphere of great airing, great contending, and great debate. Criticism is for progress, and without criticism there is no progress. Of course, this free academic discussion and criticism must be more meticulous and repeated, and we do not approve of that simplified method, because this method itself is unscientific.

At present, we are conducting the rectification movement. The rectification movement has gradually brought us a new political situation of "both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of will and personal ease of mind." This will inevitably bring a lively new atmosphere of "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" to our academic circles. We must promote the spirit of independent thinking, express our opinions freely, launch debates, and further promote the leap forward development of our socialist culture, science, and art.

    继续开展百家争鸣
    吴传启
    党中央提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，给我们的文化、科学和艺术界带来了一片新气象。实践已经证明，党的这一方针，对于促进我们社会主义的文化、科学和艺术的发展，有着重大的积极作用。
    党的这一方针是长期的方针，是发展社会主义的方针。但是，这一方针的实现，同任何事物的发展一样，是波浪式地前进的，是在斗争中成长的。资产阶级右派曾经利用“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的口号来反党、反社会主义。他们曾经在我们这个艳阳的春天里，翻起过一股黑云。
    资产阶级右派曾经采取了这样一种手法：他们把马克思主义的指导、党的领导和社会主义的道路，都说成是教条主义、官僚主义和宗派主义等等，然后向人们宣称，“教条主义”等等“阻碍”了鸣放。他们利用这个办法，只许毒草独放、右派独鸣，而不许百花齐放、百家争鸣。
    因此，虽然右派分子曾经打着“大鸣大放”的旗号，但是真正阻碍鸣放的，并不是他们所谓的“教条主义”，而正是右派分子自己。反右派斗争的胜利，不仅为“百家争鸣”扫清了这种“阻碍”，而且划清了大是大非的界限，从而为“百家争鸣”创造了更有利的条件；不仅更发展了“大鸣、大放”的形式，而且把这种形式从学术上扩展到政治生活中来，从而创造了大鸣、大放、大辩论的社会主义民主的新形式。
    右派分子也曾利用过“独立思考”的口号，来反党、反社会主义和反对马克思主义。他们要求人们的思考“独立”于社会主义道路之外，为复辟资本主义而服务。
    其实，只有马克思主义者才是真正主张独立思考的，因为马克思主义就是要求人们进行独立思考的一种科学。列宁曾经说过：“在任何一个严重的问题上，不经过相当的独立的功夫，是无论如何找不到真理的”。因此，真正的独立思考，当然就是科学的思考，就是辩证唯物主义的思考；从而独立思考本身，也就意味着同一切唯心主义、僧侣主义和信仰主义彻底决裂，从这些迷信中解放出来。换而言之，独立思考的真义，就在于破除唯心主义的迷信，发展辩证唯物主义的科学。但是，右派分子主张“独立思考”恰恰相反，他们是用以反对科学的，是用以阻挡进步、抵抗发展的。
    我们所主张的“独立思考”，是实事求是地追求真理服从科学的唯物主义的治学态度。由于我们在大是大非上有了共同承认的政治标准，在发展科学上有了共同的良好愿望，那末这种学术上的争论，——这一种意见同那一种意见之争，包括唯心主义同唯物主义之争，资产阶级观点同无产阶级观点之争，就总会求得是非趋于一致，达到提高认识和推进科学的目的。归根结底，客观的真理的标准只有一个。井底之蛙，不见天地之大；泰山之巅，则见鲁国之小。但是，天地大小只有一个。如果不经过这种“独立思考”和自由论辩的途径，就不能使科学不断发展，就不能使认识不断提高。并且，旧的是非趋于一致，新的争论又会冒出来；科学的发展，就是这样一个不间断上升运动的过程。
    总之，反右派斗争的胜利，为我们学术上的“百家争鸣”，创造了更有利的条件，开辟了更美好的前景。
    马克思主义认为，学术不能脱离政治，特别是哲学社会科学部门更是如此。因此，毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中，提出了六条适合于一切科学、艺术活动的共同的政治标准，帮助各种自由讨论沿着正确的轨道前进。但是，这决不是把学术问题同政治问题简单地看成一回事情。
    这是因为，首先，毛主席提出的六条政治标准，是一切科学、艺术活动的共同标准。但是，它们不是一切科学艺术部门的唯一的标准。每一科学、艺术部门，又都有“一些各自的标准”（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）。其次，一个人在政治上接受了社会主义，而在学术上还保有资产阶级观点，这对于某些知识分子的思想改造来说，往往是一个不可避免的过程。在这种情形下，学术上的错误，并不同时具有政治上的反动倾向。当然，在社会科学和文学艺术方面，如果一个人在政治上反党、反社会主义，那末他的学术观点也就必然会是错误的。
    资产阶级右派同人民之间的矛盾，是敌我矛盾。但是，在人民的内部，学术上的资产阶级观点同无产阶级观点之争，唯心主义同唯物主义之争，是属于人民内部矛盾的。学术问题同政治问题之间，是既有联系而又大有区别的，我们不应把学术问题同政治问题混为一谈。
    然而，有些右派分子，就在这个问题上，也企图用颠倒是非的办法来混淆视听。有些右派分子把他们反党、反社会主义的言行，说成只是学术上的争鸣，说成并非是反对社会主义的政治问题。但是，事实胜于雄辩，他们的诡计是掩盖不了人民的耳目的。右派分子的言行，恰好没有什么学术气味，而正是在根本政治问题上反党、反社会主义。他们只是以学术为名，而行其反党、反社会主义之实。从所谓“两院制”、“平反委员会”和“党天下”的谬论，到葛佩琦的要“杀共产党员”；从章乃器的“定息不是剥削”和“资产阶级没有两面性”的谬论，到徐懋庸的“不要怕不民主”的“杀身成仁”论；从右派的“科学纲领”，到那些资产阶级社会科学的复辟论等等，我们找不出什么真正的学术问题，更不用说他们那些“策划于密室”和“点火于基层”的罪恶活动。由此可见，他们之所以成为资产阶级右派，决不是因为他们在学术问题上犯了错误，而是因为他们反党、反社会主义，在根本的政治问题上坚决同人民为敌而自外于人民。我们必须揭穿右派分子这种混淆视听的手法。
    另一方面，我们决没有把属于学术问题上的错误，简单地当成政治问题来对待。有许多人在学术问题上不同程度地表现了错误观点，甚至有的人表现了浓厚的唯心主义和资产阶级观点，然而他们并没有被作为资产阶级右派。而且，其中许多人在反右派斗争中，表现了积极的政治态度，表现了他们是拥护党的领导和社会主义道路的。这些事实说明了我们是把学术问题同政治问题加以区别对待的。只要在政治上有共同承认的标准，那末即使在学术问题上存在着资产阶级观点和无产阶级观点之间的尖锐对立，也只是属于人民内部的学术争论问题。而学术上的问题，只能通过反复地、细致地自由讨论的方式，逐步达到辨清是非的目的。
    当然，学术问题上这一种见解同那一种见解之争，往往表现着不同的阶级观点之争；但也有不属于上述性质的争论。然而在政治上对于人民内部问题同敌我问题的区分，则不是取决于一个人的学术观点，而是取决于在根本之点上是否反党、反社会主义，是否坚决地抗拒改造和坚决地同人民为敌。
    因此，学术问题同政治问题是有区别的。学术上的错误，不能简单地同政治问题等同起来；而政治上的反动，也不能说成学术问题。经过反右派斗争的胜利，这些界限为人们更清楚地了解。这也就为我们进一步开展学术上的百家争鸣，带来了更有利的条件。
    学术问题同政治问题的区别，已如前述。但是，有的人对于学术上的自由讨论和互相辩驳，还不习惯。因此，有的人就存在着这样一些顾虑：认为怕放出错误观点，被人抓辫子、受批判。显然，这种顾虑是多余的，对于发展科学和个人进步都没有好处。
    一个人的某种学术观点，在没有提出经过辩论以前，往往是不容易辨别是正确的还是错误的。因此，如果怕犯错误而不提出自己的观点，那便可能把正确的见解也埋没了。并且，即使发表了错误观点，经过辩论，也有利于修正错误和得到真理。用隐蔽自己的观点的办法，是不可能达到避免错误的目的的。科学的态度，应该是本着坚持真理、改正错误的态度；大胆提出自己的观点，在辩论中前进。也有人认为自己马克思主义水平不高，要待学好了马克思主义再鸣再争。我们认为，作为要求学习马克思主义的愿望来说，当然是好的。但谁的马克思主义水平高，谁的马克思主义水平低，需要在争鸣的过程中才能体现出来。而且对于学习马克思主义来说，只有参加到斗争的实践过程中才能学好；而参加争鸣的本身，就是最好的学习马克思主义的办法。
    当然，对于错误观点是应该要批判的。但是，某种观点在没有提出经过辩论以前，是不容易辨别它是正确的，还是错误的。即使是错误观点，经过批判，也只会给自己带来益处。所以问题在于人们怎样来看待这种学术上的讨论和批判。所谓“百家争鸣”，当然就是在学术上有“鸣”的自由，也有“争”的自由；有批评的自由，也有反批评的自由；有发表资产阶级观点来进行辩论的自由，也有批评这种观点的自由。不管这种批判是对己对人，我们都应该从积极意义上欢迎和参加，而不应该从消极意义上害怕。一切正确的东西是不怕批评的。马克思主义是一种科学真理，它是不怕批评的。真理不怕辩驳，真金不怕火炼。正因为是这样，所以马克思主义者主张“百家争鸣”，不像右派那样，只许他们自己一家独鸣。另一方面，只要人们不是坚持错误，那就也不应该害怕对自己错误观点的批评。只有人们毫无顾虑地提出自己的观点，在讨论中辩清正确和错误以后，才更有利于改正错误和提高认识。在我们的政治生活中，需要这种经常的批评和自我批评；在学术研究工作中，也需要造成这种大鸣、大放、大辩论的新风气。批评是为了进步，没有批评就没有进步。当然，这种学术上的自由讨论和批判，必须是更加细致的、反复的，我们不赞成那种简单化的办法，因为这种办法本身也是不科学的。
    目前，我们正在进行整风运动。整风运动已经逐渐给我们带来了“又有集中又有民主的，又有纪律又有自由的，又有统一意志、又有个人的心情舒畅”的一个新的政治局面。这就必然也将为我们学术界带来“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的生动活泼的新气象。我们要发扬独立思考的精神，各抒己见，开展辩论，进一步促使我们社会主义的文化、科学和艺术方面的飞跃发展。
