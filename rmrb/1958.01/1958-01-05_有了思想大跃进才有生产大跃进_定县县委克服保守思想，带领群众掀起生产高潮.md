Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 4th—Xinhua News Agency reporter Wen Ying reports: After the Ding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party overcame right-leaning conservative thinking in production leadership, an unprecedented production leap forward movement rapidly unfolded throughout the county. The experience of Ding County once again proves that only with a great leap forward in thought can there be a great leap forward in production; without a great leap forward in thought, there will never be a great leap forward in production activities.

In the past, the Ding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was relatively conservative in its leadership of production, mainly manifested in its inability to break away from old leadership habits and its reluctance to boldly envision ways to increase production. More than 500,000 mu of sandy, alkaline, and low-lying land in the county affected production increase, especially the more than 300,000 mu of low-lying land, which suffered from flooding every year, and yields had significantly declined. However, the county committee was accustomed to the old leadership methods and dared not use a creative spirit to change the natural conditions of these areas. The county committee's conservative thinking had already brought serious losses to the county's agricultural production. The most obvious manifestation was the year-by-year decline in agricultural production. According to statistics, although the unit area yield and total output of grain in Ding County last year exceeded the pre-cooperative 1955 level by more than 10%, the total grain output of the county was still more than 20 million jin less than in 1952, and the unit area yield per mu was also about 18% lower than in 1952. More seriously, some agricultural cooperatives that had suffered from flooding for many years had lost confidence in increasing production, and did not sow in the spring, leaving the land barren.

Analyzing the situation of the Ding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the following two lessons are worth remembering. First, leaders cannot be detached from the masses and reality. After cooperation, the Da Wu Village Cooperative relied on its own efforts to dig ditches and build windbreak walls, transforming a lot of low-lying sandy alkaline land, and increased yields by two times. In addition, some cooperatives dug wells to increase fertilizer, creating high yields of 1,000 jin of grain and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes, but the Ding County Committee treated these creations of the masses as individual cases and let them pass. Second, they dared not promote new production increase measures. In the past, most of the promotion of high-yield crops in the county increased production, but only a few cooperatives blindly densely planted Baimaya corn on some barren land, resulting in reduced production. However, the Ding County Committee did not fully estimate this achievement when inspecting and summarizing this major production reform, and did not promote this new production increase measure, resulting in the county planting 170,000 mu less of high-yield crops. This was also one of the reasons why production could not be greatly increased.

Now, the Ding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has corrected this deviation. Judging from the situation in Ding County, overcoming conservative thinking is a serious struggle. In the struggle to overcome conservative thinking, the Ding County Committee took the following measures. First, summarize production and examine thinking. The wheat in Ding County the year before last experienced a serious reduction in production due to the failure to change production conditions. Some leading members with advanced thinking in the county committee seized on this lesson to promote the county committee to examine and study the reasons for the reduction in production, thereby helping most county committee members recognize their conservative thinking and find two major production increase measures: raising pigs to increase fertilizer and transforming low-lying land. Second, visit other places to broaden horizons. In the past year, the Ding County Committee organized more than ten visits to other places led by the secretary. After a secretary visited advanced units in Hubei, Shandong, and other places and saw their achievements in pig raising, he broke the original conservative thinking that Ding County pigs were more suitable for breeding. Third, continue to overcome conservative thinking in the practice of the production movement. The Ding County Committee used the method of mobilizing cadres and the masses to visit, helping some cadres and members who were unwilling to carry out low-lying land transformation to dispel their worries about flooding. The masses' demands for low-lying land transformation greatly exceeded the county committee's original expectations, which also helped the county committee overcome conservative emotions. The original plan for the speed of low-lying land transformation was advanced by two years, and the area of rice planting last year increased from the original plan of 50,000 mu to more than 150,000 mu. Fourth, learn from the advanced production increase experience of the masses. During the autumn harvest, several secretaries went deep into advanced cooperatives to summarize the experience of high-yield production. After the county committee learned from the experience of the Bei Wang Su Agricultural Cooperative in deeply excavating land to increase sweet potato production, it organized cadres and the masses to visit and put forward requirements for numbers to be promoted throughout the county. The county quickly deeply excavated more than 160,000 mu of white land in preparation for cultivating high yields. In this way, production leadership broke the old habits.

Now, the great leap forward in thinking of the Ding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has achieved practical results. The county committee's production plan for this year is both advanced and reliable. The plan requires that the average yield per mu of the county's 1,080,000 mu of grain crops increase by 52% compared to last year, achieving the national agricultural development outline target of 451 jin per mu nine years ahead of schedule, based on last year's 295 jin. The 190,000 mu of cotton will also increase from 30.8 jin per mu last year to 47 jin. In order to achieve the above requirements, the Ding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formulated more than a dozen production increase measures, such as transforming low-lying land before spring, improving sandy alkaline soil, building water conservancy projects, expanding irrigated land, and changing to rice planting. The Ding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has successively established specialized leading organizations for low-lying land transformation, sandy alkaline land transformation, and pig raising, and has also drawn six secretaries or standing committee members to take charge of leadership separately. Now, the county has organized more than 200,000 laborers to invest in the water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movement, completed about half of the various production and construction tasks, and launched an unprecedented production upsurge.

    有了思想大跃进才有生产大跃进
    定县县委克服保守思想，带领群众掀起生产高潮
    新华社保定4日电　新华社记者文英报道：中共定县委员会克服了生产领导中的右倾保守思想后，一个史无前例的生产跃进运动便在全县迅速开展起来。定县的经验再一次证明，只有思想上的大跃进，才能有生产上的大跃进，没有大跃进的思想，绝不会有大跃进的生产活动。
    中共定县县委过去对生产领导比较保守，主要表现在摆脱不开旧的领导习惯，不敢大胆设想增产门路。这个县有五十多万亩沙、碱、窪地影响增产，特别是其中的三十多万亩漥地，历年受涝，产量已显著下降。但是县委习惯于旧的一套领导方法，不敢用创造性的精神改变这些地区的自然条件。县委的保守思想，已给全县的农业生产带来严重损失。最明显的表现是农产量逐年下降。据统计，去年定县的粮食单位面积产量和总产量，虽然超过合作化前1955年一成以上，但全县粮食总产量仍比1952年减产两千多万斤，每亩的单位面积产量，也比1952年下降了18％左右。更严重的是有些历年受涝的农业社，竟丧失了增产信心，春天不播种，让土地荒芜。
    根据中共定县县委的情况来分析，有如下两点教训值得记取。一是领导不能脱离群众和实际。这个县大吴村合作化后曾自力更生的挖沟洫筑防风墙，改造了不少漥沙碱地，增加了两倍的收成。另外还有些合作社打井增肥，创造了千斤粮万斤薯的高额丰产，但定县县委竟把这些群众的创造，当成个别的事例而放过去。其次是不敢推广新的增产措施，县委经常把自己的思想束缚在旧圈子里。过去，这个县推广高产作物多数增了产，只有少数社的部分瘠薄地盲目密植白马牙玉米减产，但定县县委在检查总结这一重大生产改革时没有充分估计这一成绩，没有推广这一新的增产措施，结果使全县少种了十七万亩高产作物。这也是产量不能大量提高的一个原因。
    现在，中共定县县委已经纠正这种偏向。从定县的情况来看，克服保守思想是一场严重的斗争。在克服保守思想的斗争中，定县县委曾采取了以下的措施。一、总结生产，检查思想。定县前年的小麦由于没改变生产条件严重减产，县委当中部分思想先进的领导成员即抓住这一教训推动县委检查研究减产原因，从而帮助多数县委成员认识到自己的保守思想，并找到了养猪增肥和改造窪地等两项主要增产措施。二、到外地参观开阔眼界。定县县委在去年一年当中，曾组织以书记为首的外地参观十多次。有个书记参观了湖北、山东等地先进单位的养猪成绩后，便打破了原来认为定县猪多种好的保守思想。三、在生产运动的实践中继续克服保守思想。定县县委利用发动干部、群众参观的方法，帮助一些不愿进行窪地改造的干部、社员打消了怕引水淹地的思想顾虑后，群众改造窪地的要求便大大超过了县委原来的预计，因此也帮助县委克服了保守情绪；将原计划的窪改速度提前了两年，去年改种水稻的面积也由原计划的五万亩增到十五万亩以上。四、学习群众的先进增产经验。秋收时，几位书记曾深入先进社队总结高额丰产经验。县委学习了北王宿农业社深掘土地增产甘薯的经验后，组织干部群众参观，并提出要求数字向全县推广，全县迅速深挖了十六万多亩准备培养丰产的白地。这样生产领导便打破了旧习惯。
    现在，中共定县县委思想上的大跃进已收到了实际效果。县委今年的生产计划订的既先进又可靠，计划要求全县一百零八万亩粮食作物的亩产量，平均比去年增产52％，在去年二百九十五斤的基础上，提前九年实现全国农业发展纲要的指标，达到亩产四百五十一斤。十九万亩棉花，也由去年亩产三十斤八两增到四十七斤。为实现上述要求，中共定县县委已制订出春季前改造窪地，改良沙碱土壤，兴建水利工程，扩大水浇地，改种水稻等十几项增产措施。中共定县县委已先后建立了窪改、沙碱改和养猪等专门领导组织，并抽出了六名书记或常委分头专责领导。现在，全县已组织起二十多万劳力投入了水利积肥运动，完成了半数左右的各项生产建设任务，掀起了一个史无前例的生产高潮。
