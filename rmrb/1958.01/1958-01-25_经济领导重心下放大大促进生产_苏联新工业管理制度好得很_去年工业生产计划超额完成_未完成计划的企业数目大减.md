Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 24th: According to Soviet newspapers, the situation since the National Economic Councils of the Soviet Union's 105 economic regions began operating on July 1st of last year shows that the new industrial and construction management system implemented by the Soviet Union, which decentralizes economic leadership, has greatly improved industrial production.

The successful completion of the Soviet Union's overall industrial production plan last year powerfully demonstrates this. According to the Soviet state plan, Soviet industrial production was originally intended to increase by 7.1% last year, but according to preliminary statistics, it actually increased by 10%; that is to say, the original plan was greatly overfulfilled. This situation has been rare in recent years. For example, in 1952 and 1953, the Soviet industrial production plans were both fulfilled by 101%, and in 1954 and 1955, the industrial production plans were both fulfilled by 103%. In 1956, industrial production was originally intended to increase by 10.5%, but it actually increased by nearly 11%, that is to say, the plan was slightly overfulfilled.

The good performance of various regions and industrial sectors in the Soviet Union in completing their industrial production plans last year also demonstrates the superiority of the new system. In that year, the number of industrial sectors and enterprises nationwide that failed to meet their plans was greatly reduced. For example, in the Tajik Republic (which is a single economic region), the number of industrial enterprises that failed to meet their production plans last year was half that of 1956. Taking industrial sectors as an example, sectors such as coal mining, cement, metal-cutting machine tools, and mineral fertilizers failed to meet their production plans in 1956, but they all successfully completed their annual production plans last year. If we compare the industrial production situation in the second half of 1957, after the implementation of the new management system, with the same period in 1956, and with the first half of 1957, before the implementation of the new system, we can see the superiority of the new management system even more clearly. For example, after the implementation of the new system, the nationwide industrial production plan was fulfilled by 104% in the third quarter of last year, while it was 101% in the third quarter of 1956; the nationwide industrial production plan was fulfilled by 105% from October to November last year, while it was 103% in the same period of the previous year.

The completion of industrial production plans in various parts of the Soviet Union in the second half of 1957 was also better than in the first half of the year. In the Russian Federal Republic, the total industrial output value of the entire republic increased by 5.8 billion rubles in the second quarter of last year compared to the first quarter, but after the implementation of the new management system, the total industrial output value in the third quarter increased by 12.5 billion rubles compared to the second quarter. In the Kaliningrad Economic Region of this republic, industrial production increased very significantly in the first four months after the industrial reorganization. If we take the average monthly industrial production index for the first half of last year as 100, then the index for this economic region rose to 103 in July, 125 in August, and 200 in October. In the second half of last year, the average daily industrial output in the Lithuanian Republic (also a single economic region) increased by 22% compared to the first half of the year. The new economic management system also had a good impact on Latvia's industry, transportation, and construction. In the second half of last year, the total value of industrial production in this republic increased by an average of 100 million rubles per month.

    经济领导重心下放大大促进生产
    苏联新工业管理制度好得很
    去年工业生产计划超额完成　未完成计划的企业数目大减
    新华社莫斯科24日电　据苏联报纸报道：苏联一百零五个经济区的国民经济委员会从去年7月1日开始工作以来的情况表明，苏联实行的这个把经济领导重心下放的新的工业和建设管理制度，已经大大改进了工业生产情况。
    去年苏联工业生产总计划完成的情况有力地说明了这一点。根据苏联国家计划，去年苏联工业生产本来要增加7.1％，然而据初步统计，实际上却增加了10％；也就是说大大超额完成了原订计划。这种情况在最近几年中是少有的。例如，1952年和1953年苏联工业生产计划都是完成了101％，1954和1955年工业生产计划都是完成了103％。在1956年，工业生产原订要增加10.5％，实际上增加了将近11％，也就是说稍稍超额完成了计划。
    去年苏联各地区、各工业部门完成工业生产计划的良好情况也可以说明新制度的优越性。在这一年中，全国未完成计划的工业部门和企业的数目已经大大减少了。例如，塔吉克共和国（是一个单一的经济区）去年未完成生产计划的工业企业的数目比1956年少二分之一。拿工业部门来说，像采煤、水泥、金属切削机床、矿质肥料等部门，在1956年没有完成生产计划，但是，在去年都很好地完成了全年的生产计划。如果把实行新管理制度以后的1957年下半年工业生产情况同1956年同期并同未实行新制度的1957年上半年的情况相比较，更可以清楚地看出新的管理制度的优越性。例如，在实行新的制度以后，去年第三季度全苏联工业生产计划完成了104％，而1956年第三季度是101％；去年10月到11月全国工业生产计划完成了105％，而前年同时期是103％。
    1957年下半年苏联各地工业生产计划完成的情况也比上半年好。在俄罗斯联邦共和国，去年第二季度全共和国工业绝对产值比第一季度增加了五十八亿卢布，然而在实行新的管理制度以后，第三季度的工业绝对产值就比第二季度增加了一百二十五亿卢布。这个共和国的加里宁格勒经济区在实行工业改组后，头四个月的工业生产有了十分显著的增加。如果以去年上半年每月平均工业生产指标为一百，那么，这个经济区7月份的指标就上升为一百零三，8月份上升为一百二十五，10月份又上升为二百。去年下半年，立陶宛共和国（也是一个单一的经济区）每昼夜的平均工业产量比上半年提高了22％。新的经济管理制度也对拉脱维亚的工业、运输和建筑业起了很好的影响。在去年下半年，这个共和国的工业生产总值每月就平均增加一亿卢布。
