Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 4th: Since late December of last year, the rural water conservancy construction movement in Zhejiang Province has been catching up with the advanced regions nationwide.

Currently, 2.2 million farmers throughout the province are participating in water conservancy construction daily, accounting for more than one-tenth of the province's agricultural population, more than double the 800,000 in mid-December of last year. The number of various farmland water conservancy projects under construction has also increased from more than 30,000 in mid-December to more than 60,000, of which nearly 400 small reservoirs and more than 30,000 other water conservancy projects have been completed and have begun storing water.

The broad masses of peasants in the province are tenaciously launching a major offensive against waterlogging and drought. From the mountainous areas to the plains, people are working diligently on the construction sites day and night, braving wind and rain. The Majian Agricultural Cooperative in Lanxi County is building an irrigation canal that must pass through a mountain range of six peaks. The cooperative members proposed to "use the spirit of passing five passes and slaying six generals and Wu Song fighting the tiger, and the spirit of outwitting Mount Hua, to make the high mountains bow their heads." At present, they have flattened five peaks. The "East-West Tiaoxi Diversion into the Lake Project," which alleviates waterlogging disasters for more than 900,000 mu of farmland in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Plain, was completed a year ahead of schedule this spring. Currently, Wuxing County, where the project is located, is carrying out a movement to support the project, with cadres and students from the county going to the construction site during holidays to participate in voluntary labor. On the vast coastal plain, the dredging of rivers and the opening of waterways have also been fully launched.

Judging from the current situation of earthwork and stonework completed throughout the province, each laborer averages 1.4 cubic meters per day, and labor efficiency is more than double the average of previous years.

In the previous period, the responsible persons of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committees concentrated in Hangzhou to participate in the provincial four-level cadre meeting and the provincial party congress, so the progress of the water conservancy construction movement was relatively slow. After the meeting ended in mid-December of last year, Party Committees at all levels greatly strengthened their leadership over water conservancy construction. Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Secretaries Lin Hujia and Li Fengping, respectively led working groups to Wenzhou and Taizhou and other regions to guide the winter production movement focusing on water conservancy construction. The responsible persons of the various prefectural and county party committees also personally grasped water conservancy. The deputy secretaries and deputy commissioners of the Jiaxing Prefectural Party Committee and some county party secretaries personally went to the construction site to direct, and also carried soil with the migrant workers. Therefore, the water conservancy construction movement in the province has made great progress compared with the past.

### 加快脚步　赶上先进  浙江各级党委负责人加强对兴修水利运动的领导

    加快脚步　赶上先进
    浙江各级党委负责人加强对兴修水利运动的领导
    据新华社杭州4日电　浙江省农村兴修水利运动从去年12月下旬以来正向全国的先进地区迎头赶上。
    目前，全省每天参加兴修水利的农民有二百二十万人，占全省农业人口十分之一强，比去年12月中旬的八十万人增加一倍多。开工的各种农田水利工程也由12月中旬的三万多处增加到六万多处，其中近四百个小型水库和三万多处其他水利工程已经完成，开始蓄水。
    全省农村广大群众正在顽强地向水旱灾害大举进军。从山区到平原，人们冒着风雨日夜在工地辛勤劳动。兰溪县马涧农业社兴修一条引水渠道，要通过一条山岭六个山头，社员们提出要“用过五关斩六将和武松打虎的劲头，用智取华山的精神，叫高山低头。”目前，他们已经削平了五个山头。为杭嘉湖平原九十多万亩农田解除内涝灾害的“东西苕溪分流入湖工程”，提前一年在今年春季完工。目前，工程所在地的吴兴县正在开展一个支援这项工程的运动，全县的干部和学生利用假日前往工地参加义务劳动。在辽阔的滨海平原，疏浚河道、开辟水纲的工作也已全面展开。
    从目前全省完成土方和石方的情况看，每个劳动力每天平均做一点四个公方，劳动效率超过历年来的平均数一倍。
    前段时期，浙江省各地党委负责人集中到杭州参加全省四级干部会议和省党代表大会，兴修水利运动的进度因此较慢。去年12月中旬会议结束以后，各级党委大大加强了对兴修水利的领导。省委第一书记江华、书记林乎加、李丰平等，分别率领工作组前往温州和台州等专区指导以兴修水利为主的冬季生产运动。各个地委和县委的负责人也都亲自抓水利。嘉兴地区的地委副书记、副专员和一些县委书记都亲临工地指挥，还和民工一起挑土。因此全省兴修水利运动已较前大有进展。
