That afternoon, I set off with the fishing fleet of the Shuguang (Dawn) Fishery Cooperative of Xikou Village. The four fishermen on our boat were all surnamed Xia. The captain was about fifty years old, tall and thin, but quite sturdy. The one in his thirties was the village Party secretary, and the others were two young men, one the village Communist Youth League secretary and the other the cook.

Seven or eight fishing boats left the shore and hoisted their sails at the same time. The boats leaned slightly, riding the waves. On board, the village Party secretary kept mending fishing nets. Knowing that I was from Beijing, the Youth League secretary always wore a smile, asking me if I had seen Chairman Mao, and whether Chairman Mao could eat the fish and shrimp they caught; how big Beijing really was, and how tall Tiananmen was...

At dusk, the boats had sailed far away from the island. The captain ordered the mainsail to be lowered, the bow awning to be raised, and while slowly rowing, the nets were cast. In less than an hour, the two-mile-long net had been lowered into the sea.

The cooperative's fishing boats, scattered in the sea, successively lit their lanterns. In the vast sea, flickering and hazy fishing lights swayed.

As night fell, the wind gradually picked up, and the waves grew higher. The anchored boat, battered by the wind and waves, was like a tethered wild horse, kicking wildly. Everyone on board fell asleep, except the captain, who was smoking his pipe, lost in thought. I said, "Captain, let's chat." He said, "What shall we talk about?" I said, "Let's talk about yourself – from childhood to now."

Perhaps he felt that the topic I raised was too broad. After a long silence, he slowly began to speak. —He was an orphan. His father and brothers had all gone out to sea to fish and never returned after encountering a storm. Talking about the past when fishermen went to sea, he used an analogy: "In the old days, doing our kind of work was like hunting tigers." At the age of twelve, he was hired by a shipowner, and later he rented a boat to go to sea himself. He also talked about how the Kuomintang conscripted men at night, and how he fled to the mountains to hide; the tragic days the fishermen endured during the Japanese occupation. As he spoke, his voice became low, and he forgot to smoke. It wasn't until he talked about how he sailed his boat to help the People's Liberation Army liberate the coastal islands that he loaded another bowl of tobacco, smoking and saying, "The Liberation Army asked me if it was okay to fire cannons on the boat. I said, how could it not be! The sea water is very strong, it can withstand any recoil. Ha! You didn't see it, our Liberation Army's cannons were really accurate..." The topic turned to life after liberation, and he said meaningfully, "The changes are really fast!" I asked, "Where do you think the changes are fastest?" As if he felt that my question did not suit him, he asked me in return, "Where do you think changes are not fast? Take setting night nets for example. In the past, once you cast a net, you couldn't think of sleeping, you had to be on guard all night against someone stealing the net; now, you can be sure that no one will steal your net anymore. Before, going out to sea was really a matter of nine deaths and one life, and if you encountered a big storm, you couldn't think of coming back! Aren't my father and brother living examples; now, before going out to sea, you first listen to the weather forecast on the radio, and if there is a big storm, you don't go out to sea; as soon as you go out to sea, you also have our navy protecting you, how safe is that! Before, if you didn't catch fish, you starved, and if you caught too much, it wasn't good either, people would always force down the price, and if you didn't sell, you would just watch the fish rot. Now, no matter how many fish you catch, the government buys them at a fixed price. Do you think these changes are fast?" He breathed a sigh of relief, and then talked about how he joined the mutual aid team, and how the mutual aid team turned into a cooperative. He said as if making a conclusion, "The cooperative is a treasure bowl."

The night was already very deep. I pondered the captain's words and could not fall asleep. The waves beat against the bottom of the boat with a thud. The wind was even tighter, and the boat jumped very high, and then fell down suddenly, I felt drowsy.

As the sky gradually brightened, I heard the captain yelling to raise the anchor and haul in the nets. The village Party secretary and the Youth League secretary got up and stood on the boat rubbing their eyes, and asked in surprise, "Where have we reached?" The captain pointed to a vague mountain shadow in the east and said, "That's Zhifu Island."

The captain let me steer the rudder while they hauled in the nets and picked the fish. I only heard the sound of plop plop, and then they threw the picked fish onto the deck, there were plump, dark green mackerel, slender, sword-like silver-white ribbonfish, mullet and white-scaled pomfret, etc., jumping and rolling on the boat. In this tide, our boat caught several hundred fish in total.

The captain pointed to a mountain head by the sea and said to me, "Look, that's where we hid when the Kuomintang conscripted men at night. Relying on our familiarity with the geography, we could even feel our way up the mountain in the dark." He pointed to a steep slope by the sea and said, "More than a dozen years ago, one day, I was sailing my boat and happened to pass by below, and I heard someone calling out, I looked around and saw that it was a woodcutter from our village who had fallen from the mountain. I hurried back to the village in my boat and called three other people, and carried him back on a door plank, and he died overnight!" I asked the captain why he had to go to such a steep hillside to chop wood, and the captain sighed and said, "Isn't it because life forced people to do it! You think, the places that are easy to go up to, the firewood has already been snatched and chopped bare. Although this hillside is dangerous, there is a lot of firewood. For the sake of chopping a few more bundles of firewood, people can lose their lives!"

Turning past a cliff jutting out into the sea, Xikou Village was already in sight. The captain pointed to a concrete blockhouse to the north and said, "That was built by the Japanese devils. Whenever we came out to fish, as long as the bayonets on the blockhouse flashed, you had to send the fish up, and what they didn't want was yours!" I followed the captain's finger and looked over, only to see the blockhouse squatting there like a skeleton, and on the hillside above the blockhouse was a newly built road.

    海上夜话
    张奇
    这天下午，我随西口村曙光渔业社的船队出发了。我们船上的四个渔民都姓夏。船长有五十岁上下，细高挑身子，倒很硬朗。那位三十几岁的是村支书，另外是两个小伙子，一是村里的团支委，一是炊事员。
    七、八只渔船同时离岸扬帆。船儿微微倾斜着身子，乘风破浪。船上，村支书不停地织补渔网。那位团支委知道了我是从北京来的，总是面带笑容，问我见过毛主席没有，毛主席能不能吃到他们捕的鱼虾；北京到底有多大，天安门有多高……
    黄昏时候，船儿已驶离海岛很远了。船长下令落去主帆，张起头篷，一面慢慢划行，一面放网。不到一时功夫，那张二里多长的网都下到海里了。
    社里的几只渔船，分散在大海中，先后挂起了灯笼。苍茫茫的海上，飘摇着点点蒙蒙渔火。
    夜来风势渐急，浪愈高。下锚后的船儿，被风浪吹击，像一匹被拴住的野马，直尥蹶子。船上的人都睡下了，只有船长抽着旱烟，不知想什么。我说：“船长，咱们聊聊吧。”他说：“聊什么呢？”我说：“就聊聊你自己的事——从小到现在。”
    也许他觉得我出的题目太大了，沉了半天，才慢慢说起来。——他是个孤儿。他的父兄都是出海打鱼，遇上风暴没回来。谈到过去渔民出海，他打比喻说：“在早，干我们这行营生，真像抓老虎一样。”十二岁他就雇给船主了，以后又自己租船出海。他又谈到国民党黑夜抓壮丁，他怎样逃到山上躲藏；日本鬼子统治的时候，渔民度过的悲惨日月。说着说着，他的声音低沉了，也忘了去抽烟。直到谈到他开着船帮助解放军解放沿海岛屿时，他才又装上一袋烟，一面抽，一面说：“解放军问我，在船上打炮行不行？我说，怎么不行！海水力气大得很，多大的座力都吃得住。嗬！你没见，咱们解放军的炮打得真准……”话题转到解放后的生活，他意味深长地说：“变化真快！”我问道：“你觉得哪些地方变化最快？”仿佛他感到我的问话不合他的意，反问我：“你说哪里变化不快？就拿当下放夜网说吧，从前，一撒下网，你就别想睡觉，得成夜提防着有人偷网；现在，保准再没人偷你的网了。以前出海，真是九死一生，遇上大风，就别想回来！我爹和我哥哥还不是现成例子；现在呢，出海前先收听电匣子里的天气预报，有大风就不出海；你一出海，还有咱们的海军护着，这多保险！以前打不着鱼是挨饿，打多了也不好受，人家硬是压价码，你不卖吧，就干看着鱼臭坏了，现在不管打多少鱼，政府都用一个价儿买。你说这些变化快不快？”他松了口气，又接着谈他怎么参加的互助组，怎样由互助组转成社。他像是下总结似的说：“社就是聚宝盆。”
    夜已很深。我思索着船长的一席话，不能入睡。浪潮打得船底咚咚直响。风势更紧了，船儿跳得很高，又猛地摔下来，我感到昏沉沉。
    天微微放亮，就听见船长吆喝着起锚、拔网。村支书和团支委起来站在船上揉着眼睛，吃惊地问道：“这是到了哪里啦？”船长指着东方一片模糊的山影说：“那是芝罘岛。”
    船长让我掌着舵，他们一边拔网，一边摘鱼。只听见扑通扑通直响，原来他们把摘下的鱼，都扔在船板上，有肥得滚圆的青绿色鲐鱼，有细长如剑的银白刀鱼，有梭鱼和白鳞的鲞鱼等，活蹦乱跳，在船上打滚。这一潮水，我们的船共捕了几百条鱼。
    船长指着一个临海的山头对我说：“你看，那就是国民党夜里抓壮丁的时候，我们躲藏的地方。仗着我们地理熟，黑道儿也能摸到山上。”他指着一个临海的陡坡说：“十几年前，有一天，我驶船正打下面路过，听见有人叫唤，我寻声一看，原来是我们村里一个打柴的从山上摔下来了。我急忙赶船回村，又叫了三个人，拿一块门板把他抬回去，没过一夜，人就死了！”我问船长为什么要到这样陡的山坡去打柴，船长叹了口气，说：“还不是生活把人逼的！你想，好上去的地方，柴草早已抢着砍光了。这个山坡虽险，柴草却多。为的多打一把柴，人可送了命！”
    转过突进海中的一个山崖，西口村已近在眼前。船长又指着北面一座混凝土的炮楼说：“那是日本鬼子修的。每逢我们打鱼出来，只要炮楼上刺刀一晃，你就得把鱼送上去，他们挑剩的才是你的！”我顺着船长的手指望去，只见那座炮楼骷髅似的蹲在那里，炮楼上方的山坡上，是一条新修的大道。
