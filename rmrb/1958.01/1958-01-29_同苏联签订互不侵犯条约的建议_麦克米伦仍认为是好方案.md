Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, January 28th: British Prime Minister Macmillan, who is currently visiting Commonwealth countries, said at a press conference in Sydney shortly after arriving from Wellington today that he still believes his proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union is a good plan. He said that if a summit meeting were to be held, he would suggest including this plan on the agenda.

He said he is drafting a reply to the second letter from Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin to the United Kingdom on the issue of disarmament. He said, "I hope to send it out in a few days."

When reporters asked Macmillan to comment on the Cold War issue, he said that the stalemate on both sides is a good thing because it rules out war. Macmillan attempted to justify the Western arms race with this statement. He said that Western countries must maintain "strength." He wants to try to "gradually reduce forces together on both sides" under the premise of maintaining "strength," and to always maintain the so-called "balance of power."

Macmillan also said that the Soviet Union and the West have two viewpoints and two ways of life. These two viewpoints and two ways of life are completely different. However, they can coexist, each believing that their own way is the best.

Before arriving in New Zealand, Macmillan had visited India, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Singapore. In a recorded broadcast he made before leaving Wellington, he said that the Commonwealth plays a "unique force" in the great spiritual struggle that divides the world.

    同苏联签订互不侵犯条约的建议
    麦克米伦仍认为是好方案
    据新华社28日讯　悉尼消息：目前正在访问英联邦国家的英国首相麦克米伦今天从惠灵顿到达悉尼不久以后在记者招待会上说，他仍然认为他的关于同苏联订立互不侵犯条约的建议是一个好方案。他说，如果要举行最高级会议的话，他就建议把这个方案列入议程。
    他说，他正在草拟对苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁就裁军问题致联合王国的第二封信的答复。他说：“我希望能在几天内送出。”
    在新闻记者要求麦克米伦评论冷战问题的时候，他说，双方僵持不下是一件好事情，因为这排斥了战争。麦克米伦企图用这种说法为西方军备竞赛辩护。他说，西方国家必须保持“实力”。他要在保持“实力”的前提下设法“逐步地使双方一起削减力量”，并且要一直保持所谓“力量的均衡”。
    麦克米伦又说，苏联和西方有两种观点和两种生活方式。这两种观点和两种生活方式完全不同。可是，它们可以共处，各自相信它们自己的方式最好。
    麦克米伦到新西兰之前，曾经访问了印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰和新加坡。他在离开惠灵顿前在他所作的录音广播中说，在使世界分裂的巨大的精神的斗争中，英联邦发挥了“独特的势力”。
