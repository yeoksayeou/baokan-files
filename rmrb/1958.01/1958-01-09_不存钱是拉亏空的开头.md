	Not Saving Money is the Beginning of Financial Ruin

	In the past, Comrade Huang Xiuying and I had the same problem: we didn't want to save. I thought, "What's the point of saving money? I'm a state cadre, I don't have to worry about food or illness. My wife is as strong as an ox; my parents are also able to work, so I don't have to worry about them. Without disasters or difficulties, there's no place to spend the money, as long as I don't go into debt." When I met comrades who saved a lot of money, I would even "enlighten" them: "Brother, are you planning to open a factory? In our society, wages are increasing year by year. Why not spend the money now?" I was determined to stick to this idea: a monthly salary of forty-five yuan, no more, no less, just enough to spend.

	In 1956, my salary was raised to more than fifty-five yuan. My wife also joined the handicraft production, and combined with her income, plus the back pay, we had more than a hundred yuan at that time. It was like becoming the god of wealth! At that time, I also thought about saving some money in the bank. But I was used to spending lavishly, and the money in my hands seemed to bite me, I had to spend it. With money in my pocket, I wanted to stroll down the street whenever I had nothing to do. The windows of the department store were so attractive, everything seemed to be something I needed. I even bought a horseshoe watch at that time. Although my wife said, "You don't need to buy a watch, if you can't remember to get up in the morning, just ask someone to wake you up." But I objected: "It's not safe to rely on others to wake you up. With a watch, it will wake you up with a ding-ding-dang, and you won't have to worry about being late." At that time, I also felt that small trinkets worth three or two yuan "didn't matter," and I bought them without hesitation. In this way, in less than two months, more than a hundred yuan was gone in a flash! Afterwards, the more money I had, the bigger my spending became, and the higher my expectations became. My income increased, but I was tighter than before.

	The problem finally happened. Last February, my father went up the mountain to pick firewood and injured his foot. He was treated in the countryside for two months, but it didn't get better. In desperation, I had to bring him to the city to stay in the hospital for more than a month. Including travel expenses, it cost more than one hundred and forty yuan; after he went back, he couldn't work, and the family income was greatly reduced. The medical expenses, plus the living expenses of my parents, weighed me down. Since then, I have been dealing with debt, and although the organization subsidized me, I still owed more than sixty yuan, which I could not pay off.

	It really is "misfortune never comes singly." In May, my wife gave birth to a child. After she and the baby left the hospital, Mao Mao had no clothes to wear, and we couldn't even afford a cradle. My wife glared at me when she saw me: "I told you to save some money, but you didn't listen. Now it's good, we're as poor as church mice!" I was both angry and pressured. There was no way, I had to apply for subsidies again.

	Life was difficult, and the mental burden was even greater. I was worried about food and clothing all day long, and I had no mind to work. When drafting documents, if I came across the words "sewing cooperative," I would think of the lack of clothes for the children to change; if I came across "recurring expenses," I would worry about my parents going hungry at home. My eyebrows couldn't be relaxed, my singing decreased, and everything became lax. Both economically and in my work, I brought losses to the country. If it weren't for the care of the organization, I would have almost missed my chance to go to school. Looking back, I can't help but feel ashamed.

	"If you have grain stored all year round, you don't have to be afraid of famine." In the old society, this sentence was just a fantasy for the poor. Now, we have "grain" to store, but if we don't store it, and a "famine" occurs, it will also involve the country, which is really unfair to the Party and the people. I hope Comrade Huang Xiuying will take me as a warning!

专栏：这是浪费吗？

    不存钱是拉亏空的开头
    以前，我和黄秀英同志有个相同的毛病，不想积蓄。我想：“存钱干啥，我是国家干部，不愁吃，不怕病。爱人是拿斧头也打不倒的人，身体棒得很；父母亲也都能劳动，不用我操心。无灾无难，存钱也没处花，不欠账就行了。”遇上存款多的同志，我还“开导”他：“老兄，你想开个工厂吗？在咱们这个社会里，工资一年比一年多，现在有钱不花，为的啥？”我就拿定这个主意：每月工资四十五元，不多不少，刚好花了。
    1956年评薪，我的工资提高到五十五元多。爱人也参加了手工业生产，连同她的收入，加上补发的薪金，当时一共有了一百多块。这像成了财神爷啦！当时，我也想存点钱到银行去。但是大手大脚花惯了，钱在手里就像咬人似的，非使出去不可。怀里揣着钱，没事就想逛大街。百货公司的橱窗又那么吸引人，样样都成了我需要的。我在当时也买了只马蹄表。虽然我爱人也说：“可以不买表，早晨不记得起床，请别人喊喊就行啦。”可是我反对：“别人喊不保险，有个表，到时候叮叮当当地把你闹醒，再不要担心迟到了。”那时候，我对三两块钱的小玩艺也是觉得“那更算不了什么”，掏钱就买。就这样，不到两个月，百多块钱哗啦啦的都出去了！往后，钱越多，手脚越大，眼睛越高。收入增加了，反倒比以前紧得多。
    问题终于发生了。去年2月，我父亲上山挑柴火，把脚跌伤。在乡下治了两个来月，老是不见好。不得已，只好把他接到城里来住了一个多月医院。连路费一共花了一百四十多块；回去后还不能生产，家里收入大大减少。医药费加上父母亲的生活费，压得我喘不过气来。从此，我和债鬼打上了交道，虽然组织上补助了我，还是欠了六十多元，怎么也还不清。
    真是“祸不单至”。5月间爱人又生了小孩。她母子俩出了医院，毛毛就没有衣服穿，连个摇篮也买不起。爱人见了我就瞪眼睛：“叫你存点钱，你不听，这会子好啦，穷得叮当响！”又受气，又受逼。没法子，只好再次申请补助。
    生活困难，精神上的负担更大了。整天愁吃愁穿，连工作也没心思。起草文稿，碰上“缝纫社”几个字，就会想起孩子缺乏换洗的衣服；碰上“经常开支”，就会担心父母亲在家挨饿。眉毛展不开了，歌声减少了，一切都松劲了。无论经济上、工作上也都给国家带来了损失。要是没有组织上的照顾，还险些耽误了升学。回想起来，不由得脸也发烧。
    “常年有存粮，不怕闹饥荒”。在旧社会，这句话只是穷人们的一个幻想。现在，咱们有“粮”可存了，但是不存，闹起“饥荒”来还牵连了国家，真对不起党和人民。我希望黄秀英同志以我为戒！
