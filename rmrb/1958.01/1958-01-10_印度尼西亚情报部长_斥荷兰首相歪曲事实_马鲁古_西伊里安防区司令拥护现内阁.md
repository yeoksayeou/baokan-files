Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 9th: Indonesian Minister of Information Sudibjo today, when accusing Dutch Prime Minister Drees of making slanderous remarks to a United Press reporter, said that the current situation in Indonesia is due to the consistently closed-door attitude taken by the Netherlands in resolving the West Irian issue.

    Drees said on the 7th, in answering questions from a United Press reporter, that Indonesia had destroyed all opportunities for compromise on the West Irian issue. Sudibjo said in a radio address that if the Dutch government stubbornly adheres to the position expressed by Drees, the result will be that the West Irian issue will be even more difficult to resolve.

    Sudibjo said that the Dutch side insisted that Indonesia was using force to confiscate Dutch enterprises without compensation. This is slander and a distortion of the facts. He said that the truth is that the Indonesian government has only placed Dutch enterprises in Indonesia under government supervision and management to maintain social order and ensure the smooth continued operation of various economic enterprises.

    Sudibjo said that the Indonesian government did not, as Drees said, drive out Dutch nationals on a large scale, nor did it stipulate a date for the withdrawal of the 50,000 Dutch people in Indonesia. The Indonesian government only requested that 9,000 Dutch employees gradually leave Indonesia. On the contrary, it was the Dutch government that incited the Dutch to leave, especially those Dutch people in important positions in Indonesia.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 9th: Lieutenant Colonel Piet, commander of the Maluku-West Irian Defense District in eastern Indonesia, said in Surabaya on the 8th that in the area under his jurisdiction, which is adjacent to the Dutch-occupied area, the defense forces are very strong, and the people of this area are loyal to the central government.

    Piet said that he opposes any attempt to overthrow the current cabinet and will arrest without tolerance all those who attempt to carry out illegal activities in the area under his jurisdiction.

    Piet also said that he initially agreed to the "Charter of Comprehensive Struggle," but now he has explicitly prohibited the "Charter of Comprehensive Struggle" group from operating in the area under his jurisdiction because he feels that this group has undermined its original purpose of "carrying out local construction." He said that if the group's aim is to fight against the central government and overthrow the current cabinet, he will oppose it one hundred percent.

    The "Charter of Comprehensive Struggle" group, formed by former 7th Military District Commander Sumual and others, launched a military secessionist action against the central government in eastern Indonesia on March 2, 1957.

    印度尼西亚情报部长
    斥荷兰首相歪曲事实
    马鲁古—西伊里安防区司令拥护现内阁
    新华社雅加达9日电　印度尼西亚情报部长苏迪比约今天在指责荷兰首相德里斯向合众社记者发表诽谤性谈话时说，印度尼西亚当前的局势是由于荷兰一贯在解决西伊里安问题上采取关门态度所引起的。
    德里斯7日在答复合众社记者的问题时说，印度尼西亚已经破坏了在西伊里安问题上实行妥协的一切机会。苏迪比约在广播演说中说，如果荷兰政府仍然固执地坚持德里斯所表明的立场，结果就会使西伊里安问题更加难于解决。
    苏迪比约说，荷兰方面硬说印度尼西亚使用武力无偿地没收荷兰企业，这是一个诽谤和对事实的歪曲。他说，真实情况是印度尼西亚政府只是把在印度尼西亚的荷兰企业置于政府的监督和管理之下，这样做是为了维护社会秩序，并且保证各经济企业的顺利继续经营。
    苏迪比约说，印度尼西亚政府并没有像德里斯所说的那样大规模地把荷兰侨民赶走，也没有规定在印度尼西亚的五万名荷兰人撤出的日期，印度尼西亚政府只是要求九千名荷兰雇员逐渐离开印度尼西亚。相反地，正是荷兰政府煽动荷兰人离开，特别是要那些在印度尼西亚居重要职位的荷兰人离开印度尼西亚。
    新华社雅加达9日电　印度尼西亚东部的马鲁古—西伊里安防区司令皮埃特斯中校8日在泗水发表谈话说，在他所管辖的邻近荷兰占领区的地区里，国防力量是很强的，这个地区的人民是忠于中央政府的。
    皮埃特斯说，他反对任何推翻现内阁的企图，并且将毫不宽容地逮捕所有那些企图在他管辖的地区里进行非法活动的人。
    皮埃特斯还说，起初他曾经同意过“全面斗争约章”，但是现在他已经明确地禁止“全面斗争约章”集团在他管辖的地区内活动，因为他感到这个集团已经破坏了它最初拟订的“进行地方建设”的宗旨。他说，如果这个集团的目的是同中央政府作斗争以及推翻现内阁的话，他将要百分之百地反对它。
    前第七军区司令苏穆阿尔等人组成的“全面斗争约章”集团，曾经在1957年3月2日在印度尼西亚东部发动反对中央的军事割据行动。
