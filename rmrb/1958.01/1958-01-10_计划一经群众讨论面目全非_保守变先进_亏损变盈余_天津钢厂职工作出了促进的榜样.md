Xinhua News Agency Tianjin, January 9th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Meng Fan): Tianjin Steel Plant workers, in discussing this year's national plan, implemented the spirit of rectification, once again launching a great blooming and contending, criticizing conservative thinking, and formulating an advanced plan.

Compared with the plant's initial draft plan, the newly revised plan increases the total output value by 5.8%, and the cost changes from a planned loss of 465,000 yuan to a profit of 160,000 yuan.

After the rectification movement, the plant's workers enhanced their sense of responsibility for the cause of socialist revolution and construction. In particular, after the Central Committee put forward the call to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years, the workers' enthusiasm for production was further stimulated. During the discussion of the plan, the workers carefully analyzed various indicators and launched a debate between advanced and conservative ideas. When the open hearth furnace team of the steelmaking department discussed the issue of smelting time, someone proposed an advanced target of smelting one furnace of steel in five hours and fifteen minutes. However, some people emphasized objective difficulties, believing that it would take five hours and twenty minutes to smelt one furnace of steel. Furnace operator Wang Qifa also had this view. His reason was that there were not enough cranes, and it would be delayed if several furnaces were tapped at the same time; this year, new raw materials are used, and the quality is not good, so the melting time is also longer. The workers launched a debate against Wang Qifa's views. Some workers believed that if the rapid steelmaking operation method was seriously implemented, the smelting time could be shortened. Some workers also pointed out that the smelting time had already reached the level of five hours and fifteen minutes in the fourth quarter of 1956. After hearing Wang Qifa's opinion, the steel casting foreman also actively participated in the discussion of the open hearth furnace workers, ensuring to strengthen crane scheduling and avoid the shortcomings of waiting for cranes when tapping steel. Finally, the workers decided that the smelting time would be five hours and eleven and a half minutes, which is seventeen and a half minutes shorter than the draft plan proposed by the factory. This item alone can increase steel production by more than 7,600 tons throughout the year.

In order to achieve the national plan indicators, the workers put forward more than 1,500 criticisms and suggestions on the shortcomings in the enterprise management work. While criticizing the leaders, the employees also took the initiative to improve their work. In the past, the product quality of the nail-making team in the wire rod department was not good. In addition to criticizing the leaders for not thoroughly implementing the operating procedures, the workers took the initiative to strengthen the inspection system, and recently have been able to produce no defective products for five consecutive days. In order to reduce coal consumption, Ding Wenxiang and Wang Guicai, veteran workers of the small rolling mill in the first branch factory, implemented methods such as "add coal frequently, add less coal, clean ash frequently, clean less ash" and reduce air volume, so that the coal consumption for producing each ton of steel was reduced from 96 kilograms to 78 kilograms.

Through the rectification movement, the leading cadres of Tianjin Steel Plant further established the idea of ​​relying on the masses and boosted their revolutionary enthusiasm. Many employees pointed out in the rectification that the factory's 1957 plan lacked progressiveness, and the planning considered difficult conditions more and considered favorable conditions less, so that it lost its guiding role in production. At the same time, they criticized the Party Committee Secretary and the factory director for not mobilizing the masses enough when preparing the plan. The 1958 draft plan was not studied with the employees, but was compiled based only on past statistical data, so the plan was conservative, and some important indicators were even lower than the actual achieved level. For example, the daily output of steelmaking had reached 8.722 tons in the fourth quarter of 1956, but the 1958 draft plan fell back to 8.41 tons. In terms of cost, the 1958 draft did not propose a single saving measure, and asked the competent department to approve a loss of 465,000 yuan. These criticisms aroused the attention of the leading cadres. They immediately mobilized the planning department to check the planning work in 1957, and convened a meeting of professional engineers in the factory to solicit opinions; finally, several enlarged meetings of the Party Committee were held for discussion. After the meeting discussion, it was unanimously believed that the 1957 plan and the 1958 draft plan were conservative. The Party Committee Secretary and the Deputy Factory Director took the initiative to review the shortcomings of their thinking lagging behind reality and not actively overcoming difficulties. After analyzing the production situation of each workshop, the meeting considered various favorable and unfavorable factors, and re-proposed more advanced 1958 plan indicators and distributed them to the workers for discussion.

The spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Party Committee was conveyed to the cadres of the workshops and teams level by level, which also boosted their enthusiasm. Therefore, when they received the plan indicators, they actively discussed with the workers how to reach or exceed the plan requirements, instead of bargaining as in the past. For example, after receiving the task of reducing costs by 80,000 yuan this year, the cadres of the Fourth Branch carefully calculated the consumption of various materials with the workers, and proposed more than 20 measures, but the cost could only be reduced by about 70,000 yuan, which still did not meet the plan requirements. At this time, they did not complain as in previous years, but further analyzed the reasons why the rolling mill roll consumption target was not met last year, and proposed to establish a rolling mill roll usage chart, strengthen management, and strive for each groove to be used one centimeter more. In this way, the cost can be reduced by more than 12,000 yuan throughout the year, exceeding the cost reduction task assigned by the factory.

In the discussion of the national plan, the factory, from leading cadres to employees, followed the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift, doing more with less money or no money. The whole factory did not propose a measure that would cost the state money, and many problems were solved by themselves. For example, the electric furnace team originally planned to spend several hundred yuan to install a pig iron furnace to improve production and save materials. During this plan discussion, the leading cadres discussed with the workers to use waste materials to install it themselves, without spending the state's money. Now, this pig iron furnace has been installed with waste materials.

### 计划一经群众讨论面目全非  保守变先进　亏损变盈余  天津钢厂职工作出了促进的榜样

    计划一经群众讨论面目全非
    保守变先进　亏损变盈余
    天津钢厂职工作出了促进的榜样
    据新华社天津9日电　新华社记者孟帆报道：天津钢厂职工在讨论今年国家计划中，贯彻整改精神，再一次掀起大鸣大放，批判了保守思想，订出了先进的计划。
    新订出的计划同工厂第一次提出的计划草案比较，总产值增长5.8％，成本由原计划亏损四十六万五千元变为盈余十六万元。
    这个厂的职工经过整风运动，提高了对社会主义革命和建设事业的责任感，特别是中央提出了十五年后在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的号召以后，更加激发了职工的生产热情。在讨论计划过程中，工人们对于各项指标都作了认真分析，并且展开了先进思想同保守思想的辩论。炼钢部的平炉工段在讨论冶炼时间问题的时候，有人提出的先进指标是五小时十五分钟炼一炉钢。但是也有人强调客观困难，认为需要五小时二十分钟炼一炉钢。司炉王起发也有这个看法，他的理由是天车不够，碰上几个炉子同时出钢就耽误时间；今年用新的原料，质量不好，熔化时间也长。工人们针对王起发的看法展开了辩论。有的工人认为，如果认真贯彻快速炼钢操作方法，冶炼时间还可以缩短。也有的工人指出1956年第四季度冶炼时间就已经达到五小时十五分钟的水平。铸钢工长听到王起发的意见以后，也主动参加平炉工人的讨论，保证加强天车调度，避免发生出钢时等天车的缺点。最后，工人们决定冶炼时间是五小时十一分半，比工厂提出的计划草案缩短十七分半钟，仅此一项全年就可以增产钢七千六百多吨。
    为了实现国家计划指标，工人们对企业管理工作中的缺点提出了一千五百多条批评和建议。在对领导提出批评的同时，职工们也主动地改进了工作。线材部制钉工段过去产品质量不好，工人除批评领导贯彻操作规程不彻底以外，主动地加强了检查制度，最近已经连续做到五天没出废品。一分厂小型轧钢机老工人丁文祥、王贵才等为了降低煤耗，实行了“勤加煤、少加煤，勤掏灰、少掏灰”以及降低风量等的方法，使生产每一吨钢材的煤耗由九十六公斤降低到七十八公斤。
    天津钢厂的领导干部通过整风运动进一步树立了依靠群众的思想，鼓起了革命干劲。许多职工在整改中提出，工厂1957年的计划缺乏先进性，编制计划考虑困难条件多，考虑有利条件少，以致失去了指导生产的作用。同时批评党委书记、厂长编制计划时发动群众不够，1958年的计划草案没有同职工一起研究，只凭过去的统计资料编制，以致计划保守，一些重要的指标还低于实际达到的水平。如炼钢日产量1956年第四季度已经达到八点七二二吨，可是1958年计划草案反下降到八点四一吨。在成本方面，1958年的草案并没有提出一项节约措施，就要求主管部门批准亏损四十六万五千元。这些批评引起了领导干部的重视。他们立即动员计划部门对1957年的计划工作进行检查，又召集厂内的专业工程师开会征求意见；最后召开几次党委扩大会议进行了讨论。经过会议讨论，一致认为1957年计划和1958年计划草案是保守的。党委书记和副厂长主动检讨了思想落后于实际、不去主动克服困难的缺点。会议对各车间的生产情况作了分析以后，考虑到各种有利因素和不利因素，重新提出了比较先进的1958年计划指标，发给工人讨论。
    党委扩大会议的精神逐级地传达给车间、工段的干部，也鼓起了他们的积极性。因此，在他们接到计划指标的时候，一反过去讨价还价的现象，积极同工人研究设法达到或超过计划要求。如四分厂的干部接到今年降低成本八万元的任务以后，同工人们仔细地核算各种材料消耗，提出二十多条措施，成本只能降低七万元左右，仍然没有达到计划要求。这时，他们并没有像往年那样叫苦，而是又进一步分析去年没有完成轧辊消耗指标的原因，提出建立轧辊使用图表，加强管理，争取每一个槽孔能多使用一公分的措施。这样，全年就可以再降低成本一万二千多元，超过了工厂布置的降低成本任务。
    在讨论国家计划中，这个厂从领导干部到职工都根据勤俭建国方针，做到少花钱或不花钱而多办事。全厂没有提出一项要国家花钱的措施，许多问题都是自己动手加以解决。如电炉工段原来打算花几百元安装一个化铁炉，以提高生产、节省材料。这次讨论计划，领导干部同工人研究利用废料，自己动手安装，不要国家花钱。现在，这个化铁炉已经用废料安装起来。
