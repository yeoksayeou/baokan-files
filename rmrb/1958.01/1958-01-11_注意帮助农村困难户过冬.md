Pay Attention to Helping Rural Families in Difficulty Through the Winter
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

The rural areas are currently discussing the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). Article 30 of this program stipulates: "Agricultural cooperatives should make unified plans for cooperative members who lack labor and have no means of support, such as widowed, orphaned, and childless individuals. They should designate production teams or production groups to provide appropriate arrangements in production to enable them to participate in labor within their capabilities; and provide appropriate care in their lives, ensuring food, clothing, fuel, education (for children and adolescents), and burial, so that their living, raising, and burial are all guaranteed."

The implementation of the "Five Guarantees" work over the past two years, from points to areas, has achieved great results. The lives of many widowed, orphaned, and childless households in rural areas who lack labor and have no means of support have been guaranteed. However, the "Five Guarantees" work has not been implemented for long, and local experiences are insufficient. Some places guarantee it very well, while others do not guarantee it well enough. Some are over-guaranteed: not allowing "Five Guarantees" households to participate in labor, living off public welfare funds, or guaranteeing households that should not be included in the "Five Guarantees." For example, some elderly people have children and grandchildren, and they live well, but because they have separated from their families, they push the elderly to be supported by the cooperative. Others are under-guaranteed, pushing households that should be included in the "Five Guarantees" out of the "Five Guarantees" under various pretexts. Some areas only guarantee food and do not care about clothing. Some areas nominally guarantee, but in reality, what is guaranteed is not enough to maintain life. Some places do not inquire about the daily life difficulties of "Five Guarantees" households. Some places lack concern for the production and life of households in difficulty. In areas affected by floods, the repair of housing for "Five Guarantees" households and households in difficulty is not timely. If these problems are not resolved as soon as possible in the current cold weather, various problems may occur. Therefore, local inspections should focus on this aspect. If problems are found during the inspection, solutions should be found immediately.

Solving the difficulties of "Five Guarantees" households and households in difficulty should start with arranging production. At present, large-scale farmland water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns are being carried out in various places, with many jobs and wide avenues. According to the labor situation of each household, they can be arranged to participate in water conservancy projects and fertilizer accumulation activities. Cooperatives with work-for-relief tasks can give them priority in assigning them to work, so that they can earn some income and solve the difficulties in winter. For example, the Xingfu Zhi Lu Agricultural Cooperative in Langxi County, Anhui Province, took out more than 3,500 yuan as fertilizer funds before the Spring Festival last year to purchase fertilizer from households in difficulty and took out a portion of the investment in flood control projects to advance to them, solving the difficulties of 324 households and promoting flood control projects and fertilizer accumulation campaigns. In the winter development of sideline occupations, they should also be given more consideration to work, and help to develop possible household sideline production, so that they have temporary income and fixed income. After arranging production, some households may still have difficulties, which can be taken care of by advancing fertilizer funds or the cooperative's public welfare funds, or appropriately subsidized with rural social relief funds. For households with repayment ability, loans can be used to solve the problem. Mutual assistance among cooperative members can also be carried out in a voluntary and guided manner, but forced orders should be prevented.

All widowed, orphaned, and childless cooperative members who lack labor and have no means of support should enjoy "Five Guarantees" treatment. They should not be denied "Five Guarantees" because they have some temporary income or have people who cannot be relied on for a long time, thinking that they have support. Their temporary income can be deducted from the subsidy amount. It is inappropriate to only guarantee food without proceeding from reality. The issue of winter clothing should also be noted at present. For "Five Guarantees" households who cannot take care of themselves, neighbors and relatives can be mobilized to fetch water, chop firewood, and cook for them. The cooperative can also send workers and pay them to fix a certain cooperative member to provide these services for them. In areas affected by floods, agricultural cooperatives should pay special attention to the housing problems of "Five Guarantees" households and other households in difficulty.

Agricultural cooperatives have the responsibility to help solve the problems of households in difficulty and "Five Guarantees" households. However, it should also be seen that some agricultural cooperatives do not have sufficient strength, or have not paid enough attention to this issue, so that some difficulties have not been resolved in a timely manner. Local governments, especially civil affairs departments, should seize the time before the Spring Festival to draw out a certain amount of strength to conduct an inspection of social relief work and "Five Guarantees" work. If problems are found during the inspection, and agricultural cooperatives can solve them, it is recommended to find ways to solve them; if the cooperatives are unable to solve them, the government should provide appropriate assistance.

    注意帮助农村困难户过冬
    本报评论员
    当前农村正在讨论全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）。这个纲要的第三十条规定：“农业合作社对于社内缺乏劳动力、生活没有依靠的鳏寡孤独的社员，应当统一筹划，指定生产队或者生产小组在生产上给以适当的安排，使他们能够参加力能胜任的劳动；在生活上给以适当的照顾，做到保吃、保穿、保烧（燃料）、保教（儿童和少年）、保葬，使他们的生养死葬都有指靠。”
    两年来推行“五保”工作，从点到面，已经取得了很大的成绩。农村中许多缺乏劳动力、生活没有依靠的鳏寡孤独户，生活得到了保障。可是“五保”工作毕竟推行不久，各地经验不足，有的地方保得很好，有些地方保得不太好。有的是保得太过了：不让“五保”户参加劳动，坐吃公益金，或者把不应当列入“五保”的户也保了起来。比如有的老人有儿有孙，他们生活很好，只因分了家，就把老人推给社去负担。也有的是保得不够，把应当列入“五保”的户，用种种借口推出“五保”之外。有些地区只保了吃，不管穿。有些地区名义上保了，实际上所保的不够维持生活。有些地方对“五保”户日常生活困难不加过问。有些地方对困难户的生产和生活缺乏关心。水灾地区有的对“五保”户和困难户住房修复不及时。目下天寒地冻，这些问题如不及早解决，可能发生各种问题。所以，各地检查时要把重点放在这一方面。检查出来了就应当立即想办法解决。
    解决“五保”户和困难户的困难，应当先从安排生产入手。目前各地正开展大规模的农田水利基本建设和积肥运动，用工多，门路广，可以根据每户劳动力情况，分别安排他们参加水利工程和积肥活动。有以工代赈任务的社，可以优先分配他们去干，使他们能挣些收入，解决冬季的困难。如安徽省郎溪县幸福之路农业社，在去年春节前拿出三千五百多元作为肥料款，收买困难户的肥料，并在治涝工程投资中拿出一部分钱预支给他们，解决了三百二十四户的困难，推动了治涝工程和积肥运动。在冬季开展副业中，也应当多照顾他们出工，并帮助开展可能的家庭副业生产，使他们有临时收入也有固定收入。在安排生产以后，可能有些户还有困难，可以用预支肥料款或者社里的公益金给以照顾，或用农村社会救济款适当补助。对于有偿还能力的户，则可用贷款解决。还可以在自愿的原则下，有领导地开展社员之间的互助，但要防止强迫命令。
    凡是缺乏劳动力、生活没有依靠的鳏寡孤独社员，都应当享受“五保”待遇，不能因为本人有些临时性的收入或者有不能作为长期依靠的人，就以为有了依靠，不给“五保”。对他们的临时收入，可从补助数内扣除。有的不从实际出发，只保吃饭一项，是不妥当的。当前寒衣问题也应注意。对不能自理生活的“五保”户，可以动员邻居、亲友为他们挑水、打柴、做饭。也可由社出工分报酬，固定某一社员为他们服这些务。在水灾地区，农业合作社应当特别注意“五保”户及其他困难户的住房问题。
    困难户和“五保”户的问题，农业合作社有责任帮助解决。但也应当看到，目前还有些农业社没有足够的力量，或者对这个问题还没有足够的重视，以致有些困难未能得到及时解决。地方政府特别是民政部门，应当抓紧在春节前抽出一定力量，对社会救济工作和“五保”工作进行一次检查。检查中发现的问题，农业合作社能够解决的，建议设法解决；社无力解决的，政府应当给以适当的帮助。
