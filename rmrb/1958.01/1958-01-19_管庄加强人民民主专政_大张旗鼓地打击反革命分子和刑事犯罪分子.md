Xinhua News Agency, Guanzhuang, January 18th: In order to completely eliminate the chaotic situation of the "free kingdom" and resolutely overcome right-leaning thoughts, Guanzhuang units, with the assistance of the State Council's five-person work group, held a mass meeting on the afternoon of the 16th to vigorously crack down on a group of counter-revolutionaries and criminals involved in theft, hooliganism, and other crimes.

At the meeting, Liu Zhiwu, Director of the Tongxian Public Security Bureau, based on materials exposed by the masses and after investigation, requested approval from relevant leading organs and, on the spot, legally arrested nine people including Qu Jiang, Yu Zhongzhen, and Zhu Ziming, who were historical counter-revolutionaries and active counter-revolutionaries with major crimes, and two criminals, Liu Huai, Hu Guangxiu, and others. In addition, eighteen people, including Guan Weitang, Ye Peihong, and Pu Liandi, who were counter-revolutionaries and criminals involved in theft, fraud, and hooliganism, were legally sentenced to forced labor re-education.

Among the twenty-nine counter-revolutionaries and criminals dealt with, some were counter-revolutionaries stained with blood and aroused great public indignation. For example, the counter-revolutionary Qu Jiang served as a police chief and lieutenant adjutant for the enemy and puppet regime for as long as six years before liberation. During his tenure in the puppet regime, he used his power to extort and oppress the people and personally led Japanese bandits in robbery. After the Japanese surrender, he actively participated in the Kuomintang "Recovery Army" to arrest and shoot three of our revolutionary cadres. After liberation, he concealed his criminal history, mixed into the revolutionary ranks and the Communist Party, and usurped positions such as party branch committee member and chairman of the trade union. Despite repeated movements, he consistently refused to confess his counter-revolutionary crimes.

Some of the criminal behaviors of the thieves, fraudsters, and hooligans were extremely heinous. For example, the hooligan and swindler Huang Zheng, a junior high school graduate, fabricated his history after liberation, claiming that he had studied in the Chemistry Department of Shanghai Hujiang University, graduated from National Nanjing Ceramic College, studied in Japan, and served as an engineer in some Shanghai electrical porcelain companies and porcelain factories. With this, he gained the trust of the organization and the position of engineer. After Huang Zheng mixed into state organs, he not only achieved no results in his work in more than five years, but also caused great losses. For example, in 1956, he designed a ceramic workshop for the test site, but many equipment could not be used after completion, and the scrapping of the wet drying room alone caused a loss of more than 4,000 yuan. The bad element Cheng Bogao was lewd by nature. When the State Council's five-person work group was stationed in Guanzhuang and mobilized the masses to vigorously crack down on criminals, he also seduced a seventeen-year-old female worker. Cheng Bogao was not only lewd by nature, but also engaged in sabotage in his work and frequently spread reactionary remarks. The hooligan Wu Yintai was a doctor in a clinic in Guanzhuang. He used his work opportunities to repeatedly molest women and female nurses who came to see the doctor, which was extremely heinous and completely lost the basic moral qualities of a medical worker. The habitual thief Liu Kaishu was a major propagandist in the 3rd Security Division of the puppet regime and participated in the Kuomintang and the Three People's Principles Youth League. After mixing into state organs, not only did she often steal public property herself, but she also forced her younger brother and children to steal, and she repeatedly refused to change.

At the mass meeting, Zeng Yifan, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council and leader of the State Council's five-person work group, and Jiao Shanmin, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, both spoke. They both emphasized that the handling of this group of counter-revolutionaries and criminals was another great victory for the Guanzhuang organs and units in the rectification movement. The fact that counter-revolutionaries and criminals in the Guanzhuang organs unscrupulously carried out various criminal activities showed that Guanzhuang not only had contradictions among the people, but also had contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. In order to completely change the chaotic situation in Guanzhuang, it is necessary to resolutely overcome right-leaning thoughts, give full play to the power of the people's democratic dictatorship, and severely crack down on these counter-revolutionaries and criminals who are hidden in state organs and disrupt socialist order.

    管庄加强人民民主专政
    大张旗鼓地打击反革命分子和刑事犯罪分子
    据新华社管庄18日电　管庄各单位为了彻底消灭“自由王国”的混乱状况，坚决克服右倾思想，在国务院五人工作组的协助下，16日下午举行群众大会，大张旗鼓地打击了一批反革命分子和盗窃、流氓等刑事犯罪分子。
    会上，通县公安局局长刘志武根据群众揭发的材料，经调查属实后，分别提请有关领导机关批准，当场依法逮捕了罪恶重大的历史反革命分子、现行反革命分子曲江、于忠镇、朱子铭等九人和刑事犯罪分子刘淮、胡广修等二人。另外，依法强制劳动教养的有反革命分子和盗窃犯、诈骗犯、流氓等刑事犯罪分子关炜堂、叶培宏、浦琏棣等十八人。
    在处理的二十九名反革命分子和刑事犯罪分子中，有的是血债累累、民愤很大的反革命分子，如反革命分子曲江，解放前历任敌伪警长、上尉副官等职达六年之久。在任伪职期间，利用职权敲诈勒索、欺压拷打老百姓，亲自带领日寇抢劫。日本投降后，又积极参加国民党“光复军”逮捕、枪杀我革命干部三人。解放后，隐瞒罪恶历史混入革命队伍和共产党内，并窃取了党的支部委员、工会主席等职务，虽经历次运动，始终拒不交代他的反革命罪行。
    有些盗窃犯、诈骗犯和流氓分子的犯罪行为，情节十分恶劣。如流氓骗子黄政，是个初中毕业生，解放后伪造历史，说他曾在沪江大学化学系肄业，国立南京窑专毕业，留学日本，并历任上海一些电瓷公司和瓷厂的工程师等职，以此骗得了组织的信任和工程师职务。黄政混入国家机关后，在五年多的时间内，工作上不仅毫无成绩，而且造成很大的损失，例如1956年为试验场设计陶瓷车间，建成后很多设备不能使用，其中仅湿式干燥室的报废就损失四千多元。坏分子程伯高流氓成性，当国务院五人工作组驻在管庄并且发动群众大张旗鼓地打击刑事犯罪分子的时候，他还诱奸一个十七岁的女工作人员。程伯高不仅流氓成性，而且在工作中进行破坏活动，并经常散布反动言论。流氓分子乌音太，是管庄一个医务所的大夫，他利用工作机会，多次猥亵去看病的妇女和女护士，情节极为恶劣，完全丧失了一个医务人员起码的道德品质。惯偷刘开淑，过去曾在伪保安三师任少校宣传员，参加过国民党、三青团。混入国家机关后，不但本人经常盗窃公家的东西，并且强迫他的弟弟和子女进行偷盗，并且屡教不改。
    在群众大会上，国务院副秘书长、国务院五人工作组组长曾一凡，建筑材料工业部副部长焦善民都讲了话。他们都强调指出，对这一批反革命分子和刑事犯罪分子的处理，是管庄机关单位在整风运动中又一次大胜利。管庄机关内的反革命分子和刑事犯罪分子无法无天地进行各种犯罪活动的事实，说明了管庄不仅存在人民内部矛盾，而且也还有敌我矛盾。为了彻底改变管庄的混乱现象，必须坚决地克服右倾思想，充分发挥人民民主专政的威力，狠狠地打击这些隐藏在国家机关中破坏社会主义秩序的反革命分子和刑事犯罪分子。
