Expanding Armaments Brings Economic Disaster
    The US Economic Recession Worsens, with Unemployment Exceeding Four Million
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 20th: According to the "Business Week" published on January 18th, the number of unemployed in the United States has now exceeded four million.

    The weekly quoted a report released by the Bureau of the Census on the current labor force situation, stating that the official statistics for the number of unemployed in the United States a month ago was 3.4 million. "Business Week" wrote that since then, another 750,000 people have been deprived of their jobs.

    The magazine pointed out that the industries where employers are currently laying off the most workers are the automotive, steel, and metal processing industries. Due to production cuts, the three largest automobile companies—"General Motors," "Ford," and "Chrysler"—have announced the layoff of 5,000 or more workers each. At many other automobile factories, workers' weekly working hours have been reduced, and their wages have been reduced accordingly. Many workers have been laid off from the metal processing industry. The machine tool manufacturing industry is gradually laying off workers as orders decrease.

    The sharp increase in the number of unemployed in the United States has caused anxiety among many American newspapers, because during the US economic recession of 1953-54, the number of unemployed at that time did not exceed four million.

    扩军备战带来经济灾难
    美国经济衰退有加无已失业工人已超过四百万
    新华社20日讯　纽约消息：据1月18日出版的“商业周刊”报道，美国失业人数目前已经超过四百万人。
    这家周刊援引人口调查局发表的关于现有劳动力情况的报告说，在一个月前，美国的失业人数据官方统计是三百四十万人。“商业周刊”写道，从那时起到现在又有七十五万人被剥夺了工作。
    杂志指出，目前资方解雇工人最多的是汽车业、钢铁业和金属加工工业。由于生产减少，三家规模最大的汽车公司——“通用汽车公司”、“福特汽车公司”和“克莱斯勒汽车公司”已宣布各裁减五千或五千以上的工人。其他许多汽车工厂的工人每周的工作时间减少了，工资也相应地减少。许多工人已从金属加工工业中被裁减出来。机床制造业随着定货的减少正在陆续解雇工人。
    美国失业人数的急剧增加已经引起美国许多报刊的不安，因为在1953—54年美国经济衰退时，失业人数当时还没有超过四百万人。
