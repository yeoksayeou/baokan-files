Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 27th - US government officials announced on the 26th that the US Department of Defense had attempted to launch a "Vanguard" satellite rocket again in the past week, but failed due to a "series of minor accidents."

Since the United States attempted to launch an artificial satellite with a "Vanguard" rocket on December 6 last year and failed, the subsequent test preparation work has been carried out in secret. Before the test, Navy Secretary Gates made a special statement saying that the possibility of successfully launching the US "artificial satellite" test sphere was "small".

    美国发射卫星再次失败丢丑
    新华社27日讯华盛顿消息：美国政府官员26日宣布，过去一星期美国国防部曾经尝试再一次发射“先锋号”卫星火箭，结果由于“一系列轻微事故”而失败了。
    自从去年12月6日美国企图用“先锋号”火箭发射人造卫星失败以来，随后的试验准备工作一直是秘密进行的。在试验之前海军部长盖茨曾经特别发表声明说，发射美国“人造卫星”试验球体成功的可能性是“小”的。
