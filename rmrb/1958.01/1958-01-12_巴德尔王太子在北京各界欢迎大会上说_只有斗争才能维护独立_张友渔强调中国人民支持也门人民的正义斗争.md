Xinhua News Agency, January 11th – At a welcome rally attended by over 8,000 people from all walks of life in Beijing on the afternoon of the 11th, Crown Prince Badr, Deputy Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Yemen, said that the imperialist aggressive forces will one day be completely eliminated, and the people of Eastern countries will one day completely get rid of colonial rule and restore their glorious history.

Crown Prince Badr, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, arrived at the venue at 3:30 PM. At that moment, thunderous applause erupted throughout the Beijing Gymnasium and continued for a long time. Crown Prince Badr delivered a lengthy speech lasting one and a half hours, severely condemning the criminal colonial rule and the series of aggressive activities carried out by Western imperialist countries in Middle Eastern countries recently.

In his speech, Crown Prince Badr pointed out that the people of Asian and African countries have awakened and fully realized that they must unite closely and wage a resolute struggle against imperialism for their survival and freedom. Only through struggle can they get rid of imperialist enslavement and maintain world peace.

Crown Prince Badr emphasized that, in order to achieve their goal of oppressing and enslaving the people of the East, imperialism has created divisions among Eastern countries, especially Arab countries, and undermined their unity. Crown Prince Badr pointed out that the people of Asian and African countries have not only fully realized the importance of unity since World War II, but their friendly and cooperative relations are also being strengthened, with the Bandung Conference held in 1955 being a most vivid example.

In an impassioned tone, the Crown Prince declared that the Bandung Conference shook the foundation of imperialism and wrote a charter in which the people of Asian and African countries shouted for freedom, peace, and peaceful coexistence. He also said that only by jointly adhering to the charter of peaceful coexistence can human freedom be protected and human culture be protected.

Crown Prince Badr said that China demands its territorial integrity, and Yemen also demands its territorial integrity, demanding that the imperialists return the Yemeni territory they have occupied without any basis. The forces of imperialism will never last forever, and final victory belongs to us. In his speech, he also severely condemned the criminal acts of aggression carried out by imperialists in Palestine and Algeria, and demanded that imperialism withdraw all military bases.

Speaking of his visit to China, Crown Prince Badr said that the Chinese government sincerely wishes to strengthen the friendly relations between Yemen and China and strengthen cooperation in various fields such as economy, culture, art, and science. He also said that during his visit, he saw the strong will of the Chinese people in developing the economy and building their motherland, which made him believe that the future of the people of Eastern countries is bright after gaining freedom. He also said that this visit strengthened his belief that the people of Asian and African countries will definitely have a bright future.

In concluding his speech, Crown Prince Badr shouted: The friendship between the Yemeni and Chinese people will develop day by day, the unity of the people of Asian and African countries will gradually be strengthened, and freedom, friendship, and peace will achieve greater development.

Crown Prince Badr's enthusiastic speech constantly elicited storms of applause from the audience.

At the beginning of the welcoming rally, Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, delivered a speech to welcome the distinguished guests. He emphasized that the Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Arab people as their own struggle and their victory as their own victory. We firmly support the just struggle of the Yemeni people to safeguard national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Zhang Youyu then said that the struggle of the Yemeni people is very heroic. Although there will still be many difficulties on the road ahead, the Chinese people firmly believe that the just struggle waged by the Yemeni people will surely be victorious.

Zhang Youyu said, "We believe that Crown Prince Badr's visit to our country will surely lead to new developments in the traditional friendship between China and Yemen and will make beneficial contributions to the cause of peace in Asia, Africa, and the world."

Zhang Youyu also presented a banner and gifts on behalf of the people of Beijing to Crown Prince Badr. On a red flag embroidered with golden characters, the wishes of the people of Beijing were expressed in these words: "We salute the heroic Yemeni people who bravely defend national independence and resolutely oppose colonialism. May the people of China and Yemen unite and dedicate our strength to defending peace in Asia, Africa, and the world." After the welcoming rally, artists from the capital performed wonderful cultural programs for the distinguished guests. After the performance, the distinguished guests, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu, and Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu, stepped into the center of the venue to meet with the performers and presented them with flower baskets. At this time, the whole audience stood up, and warm applause and melodious music intertwined and lasted for five or six minutes. (Attached picture)

    巴德尔王太子在北京各界欢迎大会上说
    只有斗争才能维护独立
    张友渔强调中国人民支持也门人民的正义斗争
    新华社11日讯　也门王国副首相巴德尔王太子11日下午在北京各界人民八千多人的欢迎大会上说，帝国主义的侵略势力总有一天将全部消灭，东方各国人民总有一天将彻底摆脱殖民主义的统治，恢复他们的光荣历史。
    巴德尔王太子由周恩来总理陪同在下午三时半来到大会会场。这时，整个北京体育馆响起春雷般的热烈掌声，经久不息。巴德尔王太子在大会上以一小时半的时间发表了长篇讲话，严厉地谴责了罪恶的殖民主义统治和西方帝国主义国家最近在中东国家所进行的一系列侵略活动。
    巴德尔王太子在讲话中指出，亚非各国人民已经觉醒，充分认识到必须紧密地团结起来，为自己的生存和自由同帝国主义作坚决的斗争，只有斗争才能摆脱帝国主义的奴役，才能维护世界和平。
    巴德尔王太子强调说，帝国主义为了达到他们压迫和奴役东方人民的目的，曾经在东方各国特别是阿拉伯国家之间制造分裂，破坏他们的团结。巴德尔王太子指出，亚非各国人民不仅从第二次世界大战以后已经充分认识到必须团结起来的重要意义，并且他们的友好合作关系正在日益加强，1955年召开的万隆会议就是一个最鲜明的例证。
    王太子以激动的语调宣称，万隆会议动摇了帝国主义的基础，写下了亚非各国人民高呼自由、和平与和平共处的宪章。他又说，只有共同遵守和平共处的宪章，才能保护人类的自由，才能保护人类的文化。
    巴德尔王太子说，中国要求自己的领土完整，也门也要求自己的领土完整，要求帝国主义者归还他们毫无根据地霸占去的也门领土，帝国主义的势力决不会永久存在，最后胜利是归于我们的。他在讲话中还严厉地谴责了帝国主义者在巴勒斯坦和阿尔及利亚等地进行罪恶的侵略活动，要求帝国主义撤消一切军事基地。
    在谈到这次访问中国的时候，巴德尔王太子说，中国政府真诚地愿意加强也门中国两国的友谊关系，加强两国的经济、文化、艺术、科学等各方面的合作关系。他还说，他在这次访问中看到了中国人民在发展经济、建设祖国方面的坚强意志，这使他相信，东方各国人民在获得自由之后，他们的前途是光明的。他又说，这次访问增强了他的信念：亚非各国人民一定会有光明的未来。
    巴德尔王太子在结束讲话时高呼：也中人民的友谊将日益发展，亚非各国人民的团结将逐渐加强，自由、友谊与和平将会获得更大的发展。
    巴德尔王太子的热情讲话，不断引起会场上暴风雨般的掌声。
    在欢迎大会开始的时候，北京市副市长张友渔致词欢迎贵宾。他强调说，中国人民一向把阿拉伯人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争，把你们的胜利看作是自己的胜利。我们坚决支持也门人民为维护国家的独立、主权和领土完整而进行的正义斗争。张友渔接着说，也门人民的斗争是十分英勇的。在前进的道路上虽然还会有许多困难，但是中国人民坚决相信，也门人民所进行的正义斗争是一定会得到胜利的。
    张友渔说，我们相信，巴德尔王太子对我国的访问，必将使中也两国间过去的传统友谊得到新的发展，同时将对亚非和全世界的和平事业作出有益的贡献。
    张友渔还代表北京市人民向巴德尔王太子献旗和献礼。在一面绣着金字的红旗上，以这样的话语表达出北京人民的心愿：“我们向英勇地维护民族独立、坚决反对殖民主义的也门人民致敬。愿中也两国人民团结起来，为保卫亚非和世界和平献出我们的力量。”欢迎大会以后，首都的文艺工作者为贵宾们表演了精采的文艺节目。表演结束以后，贵宾们由周恩来总理、李济深副委员长、章汉夫副部长和张友渔副市长等陪同，步入会场中央同演员们会见，并向演员们赠送花篮。这时候，全场起立，热烈的掌声和悠扬的乐曲交织在一起，持续达五六分钟。（附图片）
