Xinhua News Agency Report: Iraqi Prime Minister Mirjan said on the morning of the 25th that Iraq has not, under the Baghdad Pact, undertaken any obligation to allow the establishment of nuclear weapons or rocket weapons bases in Iraq. He said Iraq's only responsibility is to defend its own sovereignty.

　　Mirjan made these remarks after Turkish Prime Minister Menderes made a lightning visit to Iraq. Prior to this, Mirjan had made a statement of the same content to Parliament on the 23rd. Menderes' sudden visit to Baghdad on the 24th was seen as an attempt to influence Iraq's attitude on issues such as the establishment of missile bases.

　　Not long ago, Mirjan also said that if Iraq had to choose between the Baghdad Pact and solidarity with other Arab countries, his country "would never betray its Arab brothers."

　　Iraqi Minister of Economy, Hadda, announced on the 26th the cancellation of the proposal to build an oil pipeline to Turkey. He said, "There is no question of Iraqi oil being exported through pipelines passing through non-Arab countries."

　　Hadda made these remarks during a parliamentary debate on budgetary issues. He also said that the government is currently encountering difficulties in its relationship with oil companies, which are "trying to obtain more profits than they should be entitled to." He pointed out: "We cannot allow any company to exceed its rights and violate Iraq's legitimate rights."

　　American newspapers have expressed unease about Iraq's seemingly neutral stance.

　　The newspapers also noted that Mirjan did not go to Ankara himself, but appointed former Prime Minister Said as the head of the Iraqi delegation to the Ankara meeting. According to sources from Ankara, Said's authority is limited.

　　A "New York Times" reporter, in a dispatch from Ankara on the 26th, believed that Menderes' trip to Baghdad "was a futile attempt to involve Iraq more broadly in the affairs of the Baghdad Pact."

　　The reporter quoted well-informed sources as saying that the current Iraqi government "has no enthusiasm for the Baghdad Pact." The reporter went on to say that Near East diplomats believe that "the Iraqis are beginning to feel that they would be better off if they reduced their ties with the West."

### 伊拉克再次拒绝建立核武器基地  同时取消建筑油管通往土耳其的建议  美报界对伊拉克的中立倾向表示不安

    伊拉克再次拒绝建立核武器基地
    同时取消建筑油管通往土耳其的建议
    美报界对伊拉克的中立倾向表示不安
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：伊拉克首相米尔詹25日上午说，伊拉克并没有根据巴格达条约承担允许在伊拉克建立核武器或火箭武器基地的任何义务。他说，伊拉克的唯一责任是保卫自己的主权。
    米尔詹是在土耳其总理曼德列斯到伊拉克作闪电式访问以后说这番话的。在这以前，米尔詹23日曾经向议会作了同样内容的声明。曼德列斯24日突然访问巴格达，被认为是企图影响伊拉克在建立导弹基地等问题上的态度。
    不久以前，米尔詹还曾经这样说，如果伊拉克必须在巴格达条约和同其他阿拉伯国家团结这两者之间进行选择的话，他的国家“永远不会背叛自己的阿拉伯弟兄”。
    伊拉克经济大臣哈丹26日宣布取消关于建筑一条通到土耳其的油管的建议。他说，“不存在让伊拉克石油经过非阿拉伯国家的油管输出的问题”。
    哈丹是在议会关于预算问题的辩论会上说这番话的。他又说，政府目前在同石油公司的关系中遇到了困难，这些公司“正在设法获取比它们应该得到的更多的利润”。他指出：“我们不能允许任何公司超出它的权利和违反伊拉克的合法权利。”
    美国报纸对伊拉克似乎倾向于中立主张的立场表示不安。
    各报还注意到米尔詹没有亲自去安卡拉，而是任命前首相赛义德为伊拉克出席安卡拉会议代表团团长。据来自安卡拉的消息判断，赛义德的职权是有限的。
    “纽约时报”记者26日自安卡拉发出的一条消息认为，曼德列斯的巴格达之行“要想使伊拉克更广泛地参予巴格达条约的事务是一种徒劳无益的尝试”。
    这个记者援引消息灵通人士的话说，伊拉克现政府“对待巴格达条约毫无热情”。记者接着说，近东外交家们认为，“伊拉克人开始感到，如果他们减弱同西方的联系，他们的情况就会好转”。
