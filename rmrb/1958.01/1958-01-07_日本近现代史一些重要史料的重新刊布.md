    Re-publication of Important Historical Materials on Modern and Contemporary Japanese History

    In the past decade, due to the rise of the democratic movement in Japan and the spread of Marxism, many scholars have emerged in Japanese historical circles who use or attempt to use Marxist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods to study Japanese history. The history after the "Meiji Restoration," which is closely related to the actual struggle, is the focus of research for progressive Japanese historians. However, a large part of the historical data from these ninety years since 1868 has not been circulated or has even been on the verge of being lost due to the suppression of the reactionary government. Although "Meiji Culture Complete Works" compiled by Sakuzo Yoshino and Takeshi Osatake has collected a lot of historical materials from the Meiji period, its most important shortcoming is that it excludes all materials related to the progressive and anti-despotic government movements at that time.

    In recent years, due to the needs of progressive historical circles, some very important materials on modern and contemporary Japanese history have been re-published. First of all, the reprinting of the underground "Red Flag Newspaper" should be mentioned, although this is not solely for the historical circle. The "Red Flag Newspaper" was founded on February 1, 1928, as the central organ of the Japanese Communist Party. It was repeatedly persecuted by militarists and suspended, or intercepted and confiscated before distribution. After an issue published on June 15, 1930, was completely confiscated, it was not resumed until January 25, 1931. In 1954, the Red Flag Editorial Department and the JCP Party History Material Committee collected the first issue to the one hundred and eighty-seventh issue (February 20, 1935), re-photocopied and published them in four volumes. Due to the persecution and robbery of the reactionary rule, some issues have not been found yet, but this set of photocopies is extremely valuable for studying the history of the Japanese Communist Party and modern Japanese history.

    The origin of the Japanese labor movement can be traced back to the 1890s. In 1897, Sen Katayama organized the "Labor Union Formation Society" and published "Labor World," the first magazine in Japan on the labor movement that he edited. In 1901, Katayama and others organized the Social Democratic Party. Until the establishment of the Japanese Communist Party in 1922, the labor movement and socialist thought continued to advance and spread under difficult conditions, but historical data on these aspects are very rare. Since 1955, Aoki Bookstore, which publishes progressive books, has successively published "Historical Materials on Japanese Social Movement Thought," including the works of Katayama and others and a large number of materials collected from newspapers and magazines at that time, which is of great help for studying this aspect of history. This material is divided into four sets: "Early Meiji," "Late Meiji," "Taisho Period," and "Showa Period," with a total of twenty-six volumes, which have not yet been fully published. The first collection includes "Liberal Rights Thought," "Collection of Zhao Min Nakae," "Collection of Shigeru Ueki and Kentaro Ooi," which actually focuses on the Liberal Rights Movement. The second collection focuses on the socialist movement and includes "Meiji Social Movement Thought," "Historical Theory of Meiji Socialism," "Collection of Meiji Labor Problems," "Collection of Meiji Peasant Problems," "The Socialism and Movement of the Sen Katayama Faction," and selected works of Sen Katayama, Sakai Toshihiko, and others. The third collection includes "Taisho Social Movement Thought," "Historical Theory of Taisho Social Movement," and historical materials on the "Rice Riots" that broke out across the country in 1918. The fourth collection includes "Social Movement Thought in the Early Showa Period," "Collection of Political Strategy Debates," and "Social Movement Thought in the Showa Period." In 1956, the Meiji Historical Material Research Association also published "Genealogy of Socialists" in three volumes, which are secret reports from the police intelligence agencies of the Meiji era on people engaged in socialism.

    Regarding important historical materials from the Meiji period, the "Historical Materials on Modern Japanese History," edited by Zhizong Hattori and others in 1953, should also be mentioned. It selected and printed materials that were previously prohibited from being sold or were difficult to obtain for other reasons in a wider range and in stages. The first issue has a total of twelve volumes, divided into four categories. The "Historical Materials on Political Issues" category includes records, reports, diaries, etc. from the Liberal Rights Movement in various places and "Minutes of the Senate Conference," "Complete Collection of Legal Classifications," etc., which reflect the government's measures to suppress the Liberal Rights Movement. The "Historical Materials on Rural Issues" category collects the writings of foreign advisors to the government during the Meiji period on Japanese agriculture and rural areas. The "Historical Materials on Socialism" category includes the complete "Heimin Shimbun" weekly edited by Kōtoku Shūsui and others. "Heimin Shimbun" played a significant role in the early socialist movement and the anti-war movement before and after the Russo-Japanese War. In 1911, Kōtoku and others were sentenced to death, and "Heimin Shimbun" gradually became a rare and precious book. The "Historical Materials on Women's Issues" category includes the newspaper "World Women," which advocated women's liberation at the end of the Meiji period. In the second issue and later, historical materials on labor issues, military police, thought and culture, etc. will be published successively. (Yiliang)

### 日本近现代史一些重要史料的重新刊布

    日本近现代史一些重要史料的重新刊布
    近十年来，由于日本民主运动的高涨和马克思主义的传播，日本历史学界涌现出不少运用或企图运用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法来研究日本历史的学者。与现实斗争密切相联系的“明治维新”以后的历史，是日本进步历史学家的研究重点。但1868年以来这九十年间的历史资料中，有很大一部分由于反动政府的压制未能流传或甚至濒于湮没。吉野作造和尾佐竹猛所编“明治文化全集”固然收集了不少明治时期的史料，但其最主要的缺点就是排除了一切有关当时具有进步意义的、反对专制政府的运动的材料。
    近几年来，由于进步史学界的需要，日本近现代史上一些非常重要的材料重新刊布了。首先应该举出地下时期的“赤旗报”的重印，虽然这件事主要不单是为了史学界。“赤旗报”在1928年2月1日创刊，是日共中央的机关报。它屡次遭到军国主义者的迫害而停刊，或者在分送之前被截夺没收。1930年6月15日出版的一期全部被没收后，到1931年1月25日才又复刊。1954年赤旗编集局和日共党史资料委员会搜集了第一期到第一八七期（1935年2月20日），重新影印，分为四卷出版。由于反动统治的迫害劫夺，有若干期至今尚未找齐全，但这一套影印本对于研究日共党史和日本现代史已经是极可珍贵了。
    日本的工人运动溯源于十九世纪九十年代。片山潜在1897年组织了“劳动组合期成会”，出版了他所主编的日本第一种有关工人运动的杂志“劳働世界”。1901年片山等又组织社会民主党。直到1922年日本共产党成立，工人运动和社会主义思想始终在困难的条件下不断进展和传播，但是关于这些方面的史料，却非常难得。从1955年起，出版进步书刊的青木书店陆续出版了“资料日本社会运动思想史”，其中包括片山等人的著作和从当时报刊杂志搜集的大批材料，对于研究这方面的历史有很大帮助。这部资料分为“明治前期”、“明治后期”、“大正期”、“昭和期”等四集，共二十六卷，尚未出齐。第一集有“自由民权思想”、“中江兆民集”、“植木枝盛、大井宪太郎集”，实际是以自由民权运动为中心的。第二集以社会主义运动为主，有“明治社会运动思想”、“明治社会主义史论”、“明治劳动问题论集”、“明治农民问题论集”、“片山潜派的社会主义及其运动”和片山潜、堺利彦等的选集。第三集有“大正社会运动思想”、“大正社会运动史论”和关于1918年全国爆发的“米骚动”的史料。第四集包括“昭和初期社会运动思想”、“政治战略论争集”、“昭和社会运动思想”。1956年明治史料研究会又出版了“社会主义者沿革”三卷，这是明治时代警察特务机构关于从事社会主义的人们的秘密报告。
    关于明治时期的重要史料，还应该举出1953年由服部之总等主编的“史料近代日本史”。它在较广的范围内分期选印了过去被禁止出售或由于其他原因而难得的材料。第一期共十二卷，分为四类。“政治问题史料”类里包括各地自由民权运动中的记录、报道、日记等和体现政府镇压自由民权运动各项办法的“元老院会议笔记”、“法规分类大全”等。“农村问题史料”类里收集了明治时期政府外国顾问关于日本农业和农村的论著。“社会主义史料”类里收了幸德秋水等编辑的“平民新闻”周刊全部。“平民新闻”在初期社会主义运动和日俄战争前后的反战运动中起过很大作用。1911年幸德等人被判处死刑，“平民新闻”也逐渐变成了罕见珍本。“妇女问题史料”类里收了明治末年倡导妇女解放的新闻“世界妇人”。第二期以后还要陆续刊布关于劳动问题、军事警察、思想文化等方面的史料。（一良）
