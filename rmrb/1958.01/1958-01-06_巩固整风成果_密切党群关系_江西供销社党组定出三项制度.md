Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, January 5th: The Chinese Communist Party Jiangxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Party Group, based on the improved relationship between the Party and the masses since the rectification campaign, has established a system for linking the Party with the masses, in order to consolidate the achievements of the rectification campaign and further strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses.

The content of the system for linking the Party with the masses, as formulated by the CCP Jiangxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Party Group, is as follows: Each branch should regularly convene meetings of non-Party comrades to listen to opinions. Party branch meetings and group meetings may invite the participation of the masses when necessary. In addition, they should regularly report or convey the domestic and international situation and current tasks to the masses, restore the Party class system, and strengthen the Party's leadership over trade union work. Secondly, every Party member should regard making friends with the masses as their responsibility. Party members should endure hardship first and care about the hardships of the masses, while caring for and assisting the masses politically and ideologically is the main content of heart-to-heart talks with the masses. Third, in the future, the branch committee should study each applicant for Party membership individually and draw a conclusion. Those who meet the requirements for Party membership should be admitted, and those who do not should be given directions for future efforts.

The Party Group adopted the mass line method in formulating this system. After the start of the rectification movement, non-Party comrades of the Jiangxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative raised many opinions and criticisms of the Party branches and Party members, criticizing the Party branches and Party members for insufficient education and care for the masses, for failing to talk to and contact applicants for Party membership for a long time, and for insufficient contact between Party members and the masses. The masses also raised criticisms of the ideological awareness and lifestyle of some Party members. The Party Group and each Party branch carefully studied the opinions of the masses in the "rectify while rectifying" stage and began to make improvements. The branch committee members of each branch were assigned to talk to most of the applicants for Party membership, and all eighty-eight Party members who were criticized by name by the masses in several airing-out sessions made public self-criticisms or explanations to the masses. The mutual interactions and heart-to-heart talks between Party members and the masses have also become closer.

After the rectification entered the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement, the Party Group found that some problems still existed in improving the relationship between the Party and the masses. For example, some branches had made rough changes, and the advantages and disadvantages of some applicants for Party membership and the direction of future efforts had not been well studied in the branch. Some individuals had not yet been talked to. In addition, the masses generally reflected that the content of Party members' heart-to-heart talks with the masses was relatively empty, mostly limited to daily life aspects. At the same time, the masses also raised some new opinions, such as the request to attend Party classes.

Based on the above situation, the Party Group believed that it was necessary to stipulate some systems and formulate some methods, and strengthen work in all aspects, to consolidate the achievements of this rectification campaign and improve the quality of the changes. The Party Group instructed each branch committee to further study the existing problems in improving the relationship between the Party and the masses, and carefully study the opinions and requirements of the masses. Subsequently, each branch convened a branch meeting with the participation of the masses. The Party Group secretary participated in these meetings separately. At the branch meetings, many Party members made self-criticisms, expressing their determination to improve the relationship between the Party and the masses in the future. The masses also expressed their opinions at the meeting, proposing to make friends with Party members and take the initiative to approach the Party. At these branch meetings, Party members and the masses jointly discussed the systems and methods for further improving the relationship between the Party and the masses. The Party Group finally synthesized the opinions of each branch and the requirements of the masses and formulated the system.

The Party Group's decision was issued on the eve of New Year's Day 1958 and was warmly supported by the majority of Party members and the masses. They said: We must greet the new year with closer unity.

    巩固整风成果　密切党群关系
    江西供销社党组定出三项制度
    新华社南昌5日电　中共江西省供销合作社党组根据整风以来党群关系改善的情况，定出党同群众的联系制度，以巩固整风成果和进一步密切党和群众的联系。
    中共江西省供销合作社党组制定的党同群众的联系制度的内容是：各支部要经常召开非党同志的会议听取意见，党的支部会和小组会在必要时可以邀请群众参加；此外，定期向群众报告或传达国内外形势和目前任务，恢复党课制度，并加强党对工会工作的领导。其次，每个党员都应该把同群众交朋友看作是自己的责任；党员要吃苦在前，要关心群众疾苦，而在政治上思想上关心和帮助群众，是和群众谈心的主要内容。第三，今后对每个申请入党的同志，支委会要逐个进行研究并作出结论，对具备入党条件的接收入党，不够的为他们指出今后努力方向。
    党组在制定这个制度时采取了群众路线的方法。整风运动开始后，江西省供销合作社的非党同志对党支部和党员提出了许多意见和批评，批评党支部和党员对群众教育不够、关心不够，对申请入党的同志长期不同他谈话和联系，党员同群众联系不够，群众对有些党员的思想意识和生活作风也提出了批评。党组和每个党支部在边整边改阶段对于群众的意见都认真地进行了研究，并着手进行了改进。各个支部的支委分工同大多数申请入党的同志进行了谈话，群众在几次鸣放中指名批评的八十八个党员也全部向群众做了公开的检讨或者是解释说明。党员同群众的互相来往、谈心也密切起来了。
    整风进入着重整改阶段后，党组发现在改善党群关系中还存在一些问题，如有的支部改得很粗糙，对有些申请入党的人的优缺点及今后努力方向没有在支部里很好进行研究，个别的人还没进行谈话。另外群众普遍反映党员与群众谈心的内容比较空洞，大多仅限于日常生活方面。同时，群众还新提出了一些意见，如要求听党课等。
    根据以上情况，党组认为有必要规定一些制度，制定一些办法，并从各方面加强工作，来巩固这一整风成果和提高改的质量。党组指示各支部委员会进一步研究目前改善党群关系中所存在的问题，细致地研究群众的意见和要求。随后各支部便召开了邀请群众参加的支部大会。党组书记分头参加了这些大会。在各支部大会上，许多党员都作了检查，表示今后决心搞好党群关系。群众在会上也发表了意见，提出要和党员交朋友，主动靠拢党。在这些支部大会上，党员和群众共同讨论了进一步改善党群关系的制度和办法。党组最后综合各支部的意见和群众的要求，定出了制度。
    党组的这个决定在1958年元旦的前夕下达后，得到了广大党员和群众的热烈拥护，他们表示：一定要以更密切的团结来迎接新的一年。
