    Fanning the Flames of Anti-Waste Even Higher and More Thoroughly
    Masses at Meilin Factory Seek Ways to Plug Loopholes
    (People's Daily, Shanghai, January 14th, reporter Xi Ping) The Shanghai Public-Private Joint Venture Meilin Canned Food Factory, which first ignited the flames of anti-waste, is now further developing the anti-waste struggle.
    After the People's Daily editorial "Looking at the Nation from Meilin" reached the factory, two batches of employee meetings were held that afternoon. At the meeting, factory leaders introduced the contents of the People's Daily editorial to the employees and expressed their determination to thoroughly eliminate various serious waste phenomena in the factory during this movement. After the meeting, workshops and departments held various symposiums to further expose the waste phenomena in the factory and studied specific ways to plug loopholes and overcome waste. At the symposium of the Production Section, the staff of this section, on the one hand, continued to expose the waste phenomena that already existed in the factory, and on the other hand, focused on how to improve the product qualification rate, reduce defective products, reduce the consumption quota of raw materials, and prevent "swollen can accidents." They studied several key issues and proposed many specific solutions. According to their calculations, just in terms of "swollen can accidents," as long as certain technical measures are taken in the future, more than 11,000 yuan can be saved for the country. Workers in the food workshop focused on discussing the issue of reducing the loss of raw materials during the discussion. Old worker Xu Deli exposed the phenomenon of high pork raw material loss rate in the workshop's production and believed that it could be greatly saved. After the meeting, he started to improve the operation method from himself, increasing the meat yield by 2.3%. According to the workshop statistics, if all the workers in the workshop can improve the operation according to this method, the factory can save 70,000 yuan in pork production alone in a year. Other workshops and departments also conducted heated discussions based on the key issues of their respective units.
    Now, the entire factory is formulating specific savings measures plans from the bottom up. Every worker has made a personal guarantee, and their morale is very high. Some night shift workers stayed in the factory to make personal plans after getting off work at dawn, unwilling to go home to rest immediately. Many workers' personal plans are aimed at their own shortcomings and made some specific guarantees. Workshops and departments have also formulated specific plans. The Labor and Wages Section, which is responsible for the allocation of workers in the factory, has lost more than 30,000 yuan in working hours due to improper allocation in the past three years. In this discussion, all the staff of the section analyzed the favorable situation that the factory's production tasks are guaranteed this year and proposed to save more than 40,000 yuan for the country within this year.
    The person in charge of Meilin Factory told reporters: According to the preliminary materials recently put forward by everyone, the potential for savings in Meilin Factory is extremely large. In this year, it is possible to take various saving measures to make up for the 450,000 yuan of waste losses in the past four years, and it is likely to be greatly exceeded. He said: At present, the anti-waste struggle in Meilin Factory is developing in a favorable situation. The People's Daily editorial has given us great encouragement and impetus. We are determined to continue to advance in this movement and burn the fire of anti-waste even more vigorously and thoroughly. (Attached picture)

    把反浪费之火烧得更旺更彻底
    梅林厂群众想办法堵塞漏洞
    本报上海14日电　记者习平报道：最先点燃起反浪费之火的上海公私合营梅林罐头食品厂，现在正在进一步展开反浪费斗争。
    人民日报社论“从梅林看全国”传到这里后，当天下午，全厂职工分成两批召开了职工大会。会上，工厂的领导同志向职工群众介绍了人民日报社论的内容，并表示决心，一定要在这次运动中彻底肃清本厂的各种严重浪费现象。会后，各车间和科室，分别举行了各种座谈会，对厂内的浪费现象作了深入一步的揭发，同时研究了如何堵塞漏洞，克服浪费的具体办法。在生产科的座谈会上，这个科的工作人员一方面继续揭发了厂内已经存在的浪费现象，同时着重对如何提高产品的合格率，减少废次品，降低原材料的消耗定额；防止“胖听事故”等几个关键问题，作了研究，提出了许多具体办法。据他们计算，仅就“胖听事故”一项来说，今后只要采取若干技术措施，就可以为国家节约一万一千多元。食品车间的工人们在讨论中，着重讨论了减少原材料的损耗问题。老工人徐德立揭发了本车间生产中猪肉原材料损耗率大的现象，认为可以大大节约。会后，他就从自己开始改进操作方法，提高了出肉率2.3％。据车间统计，如果全车间工人都能按这个方法改进操作，全厂猪肉生产这一项，一年内可以节约七万元。其他各车间和科室，也都根据本单位的关键性问题，进行了热烈的讨论。
    现在，全厂正在从下而上地制定具体的节约措施计划。每个工人都订了个人的保证，他们的情绪都很高，有的夜班工人天亮下班后，还留在厂里订个人计划，不肯立刻回家休息。不少工人的个人计划都针对了自己的缺点，订出了一些具体保证。各车间和科室也都制订了具体计划。负责全厂工人调配工作的劳动工资科，在过去三年中，因为调配不当，工时损失就达三万多元；在这次的讨论中，全科工作人员分析了今年工厂生产任务有保证的有利情况，提出要在今年一年内为国家节约四万余元。
    梅林厂的负责人对记者说：根据最近大家提出的初步材料看，梅林厂节约的潜力极大。在今年一年内，采取各种节约措施，以弥补过去四年来浪费损失的四十五万元，是可以做到的，而且很可能要大大超过。他说：目前梅林厂的反浪费斗争正在有利的形势下深入发展中，人民日报社论给了我们极大的鼓励和推动，我们决心在这个运动中继续前进，把反浪费之火燃烧得更旺，烧得更彻底。（附图片）
