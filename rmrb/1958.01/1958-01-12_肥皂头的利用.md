    Utilizing Soap Scraps
    When managing a household, one should be diligent and thrifty in all aspects. Those little bits of soap scraps left over are inconvenient to use, and it's a pity to throw them away. As long as we think of some ways, we can utilize them. Here I'll discuss a few ways to utilize soap scraps:
    I. Make Soap Water - Boil the soap with water to make soap water, store it in a clean bottle, and take it out as needed, which is very convenient.
    II. Remake into a Large Soap - Add a little water to a larger quantity of soap scraps (just enough water to cover the soap), and heat it over the fire until the soap softens (do not melt it completely), then you can pour it out and knead it into a large soap. Or, add a little water to the soap scraps, soak them until the soap softens, then wrap them in a towel (or cloth) and squeeze them forcefully, and it can also become a large soap.
    III. Make a Soap Bag - Sew a pocket about three inches long and two inches wide with white gauze (or a thinner cloth), put the soap scraps into the bag, then tie the opening with thread and hang it on the washstand. When washing hands, pull the bag and rub it through the cloth to get soap.

### 肥皂头的利用

    肥皂头的利用
    居家过日子，处处应该勤俭。像用剩下的一点一点的肥皂头，使用起来很不方便，丢掉也觉得可惜。只要我们想一些办法就可以利用它。这里我谈几个利用肥皂头的办法：
    一、做肥皂水——把肥皂加水煮成肥皂水，装在干净的瓶里，随用随取，十分方便。
    二、改做大肥皂——把较多的肥皂头加一点水（水盖住肥皂就行），放在火上煮到肥皂发软（不要全部溶化）时，就可以倒出揉成一块大肥皂。或者，把肥皂头加一点水，泡到肥皂发软的时候，再用手巾（或布）包着，用力压挤，也可以成为一块大肥皂。
    三、做肥皂袋——用白纱布（或较稀的布）缝成一个大约三寸长二寸宽的口袋，把肥皂头装入袋内，然后用线扎着口，挂在洗脸架上。洗手时拉过口袋，隔着布搓搓就有肥皂了。
