Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 24th: According to an announcement today by the Indonesian Army Headquarters Press Office, Army Chief of Staff Nasution has ordered all military regions to arrest former Army Deputy Chief of Staff Lubis.

Nasution issued this order because it has been proven that Lubis is related to the assassination attempt on President Sukarno on November 30th of last year, as well as to the conspiracy to assassinate the Army Chief of Staff and change the national system. Lubis was previously wanted after launching a failed coup in November 1956.

According to a report in today's Jakarta "Youth Daily," Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Djuanda confirmed at a meeting with the Parliamentary Defense Subcommittee on the 23rd that Lubis and some important figures in Jakarta were involved in a conspiracy to establish a "Sumatra State."

Army Headquarters spokesman Major Hasono told the press on the 23rd that the military possesses documents showing that Lubis indeed drafted a plan to establish a "new country."

    印度尼西亚陆军参谋长命令各军区通缉卢比斯
    据新华社雅加达24日电　据印度尼西亚陆军总部新闻处今天宣布，陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安已经命令各军区通缉前陆军副参谋长卢比斯。
    纳苏蒂安发布这项命令，是因为已经证明卢比斯同去年11月30日阴谋行刺苏加诺总统的事件以及同企图谋杀陆军参谋长并且改变国家体制的阴谋有关。卢比斯曾经在1956年11月间发动政变失败后被通缉。
    据雅加达“青年报”今天报道，朱安达总理兼国防部长同国会国防小组委员会在23日举行的会议上证实，卢比斯和雅加达的一些重要人物同建立一个“苏门答腊国”的阴谋有关。
    陆军总部发言人哈索诺少校在23日对报界说，军方掌握的文件中确实有卢比斯草拟的关于建立一个“新国家”的计划。
