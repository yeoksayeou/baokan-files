Let's Go Ice Skating

    In our motherland's north, the earth is covered in snow and the rivers are frozen, making it the perfect time for skiing and ice skating.

    Let's talk about ice skating. Look, on that white, jade-like, smooth-as-a-mirror ice rink, groups of agile people like birds are skillfully speeding and dancing; of course, there are also some novices falling forward and backward, tentatively trying their steps. At this moment, the overhead sunshine is radiant, making the ice rink even more vibrant. Are you, amidst the dazzling scene, also eager to try?

    Ice skating is not only a good physical exercise in winter, but also an active form of recreation, suitable for both young and old, especially those who sit in the office all day. First, the physical burden of ice skating mainly falls on the lower limbs, so it can greatly develop the muscles of the legs and feet. The back and upper limbs help to maintain balance and move forward while skating, so they also get exercise. Second, ice skating can train the function of the organs in the body that play a balancing role. Third, the respiratory and circulatory systems also become healthier as a result. Especially because ice skating is done in cold air, over time, our bodies will become not only resistant to cold but also less prone to catching colds. Fourth, it also has a good effect on the central nervous system, such as improving the flexibility of nerve processes and improving the ability of various organs to cooperate and coordinate with each other. As for invigorating the spirit and eliminating fatigue, the effect is even greater.

    Are you going to go ice skating? Wait a minute, have you checked whether the preparations are done?

    First of all, the size of the skates must fit your feet. If the shoes are loose, it is easy to cause sprains or fractures of the ligaments of the ankle joint; if they are too tight, they will pinch your feet and cause abrasions.

    The screws that fix the ice blades must be screwed very tightly; otherwise, the ice blades may fall off while rushing on the ice rink, which can be dangerous.

    Secondly, the clothes worn for ice skating should be warm, light, and comfortable. Wearing too much will not only make you hot when exercising, but also make you inflexible. Wearing too little will cause you to get cold and catch a cold. Socks should be dry, light, and warm; socks that are patched unevenly may rub your feet, so it is best not to wear them. When the weather is particularly cold, wear gloves and earmuffs; it is best to apply some petroleum jelly to exposed skin.

    Thirdly, you should do some warm-up exercises first. After doing warm-up exercises before skating, the movements are particularly flexible, and it is not easy to fall. This is because: warm-up exercises can improve the excitability of the central nervous system (thereby improving the activity level of other system organs), raise muscle temperature, promote blood circulation, and increase the flexibility and range of motion of joints and ligaments (this is particularly important for ice skating).

    If you have done all of these, then go ice skating! However, you should also pay attention to rest while skating. Without rest, it is easy to fall, because the lower limbs and ankles are most strenuous when skating, and it is not easy to maintain balance when you overdo it. Beginners can rest every fifteen to thirty minutes. When resting, the shoelaces should be untied to allow blood circulation in the feet and faster elimination of foot fatigue.

    Dear comrades, may you show your skills and have endless fun on the ice rink! Gao Qiang

    溜冰去
    祖国的北方，此刻雪铺大地，冰封河水，正是滑雪和溜冰的好时候。
    单说溜冰吧。你看，在那洁白如玉、平滑如镜的冰场上，一群群像鸟一样矫捷的人们熟练地在飞驰着、在舞蹈着；当然，也有一些新手前俯后仰地在?筋斗，在小心翼翼地试着步。这时顶头阳光焕发，冰场上显得更加生龙活虎了。你在眼花缭乱之余，是不是也跃跃欲试？
    溜冰不仅是冬季锻炼身体的一项好的体育活动，而且是一种积极性的休息方式，老少都宜，特别是老坐办公室的人。第一，溜冰的体力负担，主要落在下肢，所以能大大发达两腿两脚的肌肉。背和上肢帮助溜冰时身体平衡和前进，所以也得到锻炼。第二，溜冰能训练身体里起着平衡作用的器官的机能。第三，呼吸系统和循环系统也因此更加健康。尤其因为溜冰是在冷空气里进行的，久而久之，我们的身体就会锻炼得不仅不怕冷，而且不易患感冒。第四，对中枢神经系统也有很好的作用，如提高神经过程的灵活性，改善各个器官互相配合、共济协调的能力等。至于焕发精神、消除疲劳，作用就更大了。
    你要下冰场溜冰了吗？且慢，你先检查一下准备工作是否做好了？
    首先，冰鞋大小必须合脚。鞋松了，容易发生脚腕关节的韧带捩伤或骨折；紧了，就会夹脚，以致发生擦伤。
    固定冰刀的螺丝要旋得很紧，否则，在冰场上奔驰时冰刀脱落，会发生危险。
    其次，溜冰时穿的衣服，应当既能保暖，而又轻松舒畅。穿得太多，运动起来不仅热，而且不灵活。穿得太少，会受冻和感冒。袜子应干燥轻暖；补的不平整的袜子可能磨脚，最好不穿。气候特别冷时，要戴手套和耳罩；露在外面的皮肤，最好涂些凡士林油膏。
    再次，应该先作些准备活动。作完准备活动后溜冰，动作特别灵活，不容易?倒。这是因为：准备活动能提高中枢神经系统的兴奋性（从而提高其他各系统器官的活动水平），升高肌肉的温度，畅通血液循环，增加关节及韧带的柔韧性和活动范围（这点对溜冰运动特别重要）。
    如果这些你都照办了，那末，下去溜吧！不过，溜冰还应注意休息。不休息，容易?倒，因为溜冰时下肢和踝部最吃力，过份了就不易保持平衡。初学者可以每隔十五到三十分钟休息一次。休息时，应把鞋带解开，使脚上血液循环通畅，脚部疲劳能更快地消除。
    亲爱的同志们，愿你在冰场上大显身手，快乐无穷！　高强
