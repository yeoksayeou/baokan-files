Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Special Dispatch: The teachers and students of Xi'an First Aviation Technical School, with revolutionary zeal, are striving with full confidence to achieve the goal of complete financial self-sufficiency next year.

The main method for this school to achieve self-sufficiency in running the school is to rely on students to create wealth through production internships. Currently, all teachers and students are engaged in intense teaching and production work. In the internship factory, teachers are guiding students in the final inspection of thirty new lathes ready for delivery, while also guiding students in the batch trial production of new products such as diesel engines and electric motors. This year, the school expects to complete products worth more than 2.1 million yuan, equivalent to the total annual output value of a medium-sized machinery manufacturing plant – Xi'an First Machinery Manufacturing Plant. If this plan is realized, the school's 1,000 teachers and students can be completely self-sufficient next year, ensuring that they will not take a penny from the state in the future, while training 300 skilled workers for the country every year.

From the beginning of the school's establishment, the leaders of Xi'an First Aviation Technical School used the revolutionary spirit of hard work, diligence, and frugality to educate all teachers and students. When the school was founded in 1953, they used dilapidated concentration camps and hospitals left over from the Kuomintang as school buildings and used an abandoned Kuomintang Air Force hangar as an internship factory. The equipment consisted of ninety lathes that had been used for more than thirty years. When the school accepted the task from the higher authorities to train skilled workers in four trades for the country using these dilapidated facilities, some teachers and students complained that the school buildings and equipment were backward and wanted to ask the higher authorities to invest in expanding the school and adding new equipment. The school leaders, including several cadres who had run ordnance factories in the old revolutionary base areas in the past, pointed out to all teachers and students: In the past, the ordnance factories run in guerrilla environments, with only a few old machine tools and no electricity, could still manufacture guns and artillery by manually cranking old, toothless machines, and defeat the enemy. Now, the equipment in the school's internship factory is dozens of times better than in the past, and we shouldn't just want to be extravagant and ask the state for money. They also invited people to report on the arduous struggle of the Long March and other deeds, and organized teachers and students to visit and learn from the hardworking style of the peasants. This laid the ideological foundation for running the school with diligence and thrift. The teachers and students put forward the slogan "Don't ask the state for money, but run the school well by relying on our own hands," and resolutely implemented the policy of running technical schools with diligence and thrift, with production internships as the main focus.

Inspired by this slogan, the teachers and students of Xi'an First Aviation Technical School shared weal and woe and fought hard for four years. When there were not enough school buildings, the three principals squeezed into one room to work, which also served as a meeting room and reception room. When there were not enough dormitories, they slept in bunk beds, and teachers also lived with the students. Without a canteen, they built a canteen with tarpaulins on adobe walls, which also served as a club and auditorium. Teachers and students also built sports fields, raised pigs, and grew vegetables themselves.

In order to meet the needs of teaching, teachers and students transformed the outdated equipment of the internship factory. When the factory lacked a surface grinder, they converted an old grinding wheel machine. Without a milling machine, the teacher added a tool holder to a hexagonal lathe for temporary use. Without running water, they dug their own well, repaired an old water pump, and built a "water tower" on the roof with old gasoline drums to supply water to the whole school. Without a high-temperature electric furnace, they built a high-temperature furnace with fire bricks. In this way, they continued to improve the situation, ensuring that students could study and work part-time well.

Xi'an First Aviation Technical School closely integrates theory with practice in teaching, improving the quality of teaching. The students are very serious when producing. Now, the scrap rate of third-year students in production is only 0.5%, and the scrap rate of second-year students is only slightly less than 3%. Students have developed the ability to manufacture various precision machinery with outdated equipment in the internship factory. In recent years, they have trial-produced more than 100 products and are now able to manufacture complete sets of equipment and more than 20 kinds of advanced aviation instrument testers. They have changed the wasteful situation of "turning large materials into small materials, and small materials into waste materials" which was common in internships, reducing the internship fee for each student from fifteen yuan to five yuan per month.

Principal Wang Yiduan told reporters: The 2,281 students who have graduated from this school in recent years have generally reached the level of fourth- or fifth-grade technicians after being assigned to formal factories, meeting the state's requirements for training technicians.

The value created by students through half-work and half-study has accumulated a net profit of more than 700,000 yuan as working capital, ensuring the needs of expanding reproduction year by year. The net profit obtained in 1957 was equal to about 70% of the school's total expenditure; the estimated net production profit this year will exceed the school's budget expenditure. They plan to use the net profit obtained in the past and planned for this year's production, totaling about 1.2 million yuan, as funds for expanding reproduction when they are completely self-sufficient from next year.

    西安第一航空技工学校师生鼓足革命干劲
    半工半读　自给自足
    不伸手向国家要钱，全靠双手办好学校
    本报特约新华社西安专稿　西安第一航空技工学校师生鼓足革命干劲，满怀信心地为实现明年经费全部自给的目标而努力。
    这个学校争取办学自给自足的主要方法，是依靠学生在生产实习中创造财富。目前，全校师生正在进行紧张的教学和生产工作。在实习工厂里，教师一面指导学生最后校验准备出厂的三十部新车床，一面指导学生进行柴油机、电动机等新产品的成批试制工作。全校师生今年预计要完成二百一十多万元产值的产品，相当于一个中型机械制造厂——西安第一机械制造厂全年的总产值。这个计划实现后，全校一千名师生明年的经费就可以全部自给，并可保证以后不拿国家一文钱，每年给国家培养出三百名技术工人。
    西安第一航空技工学校的领导人员，从学校创办的时候开始，就用艰苦奋斗、勤俭朴素的革命精神教育全校师生。1953年建校时，他们用国民党遗留下来的破烂的集中营和医院做校舍，利用国民党空军遗弃的飞机库做实习工厂。设备是九十部已用过三十多年的车床。当这个学校接受上级任务，要利用这些破旧的摊子给国家培养四个工种的技术工人时，一部分师生嫌校舍和设备落后，想要求上级投资扩建学校，添置新的设备。学校领导人，其中有几个过去曾在老根据地办过兵工厂的干部，就向全校师生指出：过去在游击环境下办的兵工厂，在只有几台旧机床和没有电力的技术条件下，用人工摇动老得没有牙的机器，也能制造出枪炮，战胜了敌人。现在学校实习工厂的设备比过去好了几十倍，不应该只想讲阔气，向国家伸手要钱。他们还请人报告长征时艰苦奋斗等事迹，组织师生访问、学习农民勤劳的作风。这样便奠定了勤俭办学的思想基础。师生们提出“不伸手向国家要钱，全靠自己双手劳动办好学校”的口号，坚决贯彻技工学校以生产实习为主的勤俭办校方针。
    西安第一航空技工学校师生在这个口号的鼓舞下，同甘共苦，奋战了四年。校舍不够用，三个校长便挤在一间房子里办公，这间房子还兼作会议室和会客室。宿舍不够，就睡上下铺，教师也和学生挤在一起住。没有食堂，便在土坯墙上搭上油毛毡做食堂，还兼做俱乐部和大礼堂。师生们还自己动手修筑运动场和养猪种菜。
    为了适应教学的需要，师生们改造了实习工厂的陈旧的设备。工厂缺乏平面磨床，他们便用一台旧砂轮机改装。没有铣床，教师就在一台六角车床上增加一个刀盘代用。没有自来水，就自己挖井，修起一个旧水泵，并用旧汽油桶子在屋顶上搭了个“水塔”，供应全校用水。没有高温电炉，便动手用耐火砖砌成一座高温炉。他们就这样因陋就简，不断改进，保证学生能很好地半工半读。
    西安第一航空技工学校在教学中密切联系实际，提高了教学质量。学生们生产时都很认真。现在三年级学生生产中的废品率只有0.5％，二年级学生的废品率只有3％弱。学生在实习工厂里锻炼出用落后设备制造出各种精密机械的本领。几年来他们已试制成一百多种产品，现在已能制成成套的设备和二十多种高级航空仪表试验器。他们改变了实习中习以为常的“大料变小料、小料变废料”的浪费情况，使每个学生每月实习费从十五元降低到五元。
    校长王伊端告诉记者：这个学校几年来毕业的二千二百八十一名学生分配到正式工厂后，一般都达到四、五级技工水平，达到了国家培养技工的要求。
    这个学校依靠学生半工半读所创造的价值，共积累下净利七十多万元做流动资金，保证了逐年扩大再生产的需要。1957年获得的净利，就等于全校总开支的70％左右；今年预计净得的生产利润，就要超过全校经费开支预算了。他们准备把过去的和计划在今年生产得到的净利，共筹出约一百二十万元，当做从明年起全部自给时扩大再生产之用。
