    Italian and Polish Peace Movement Representatives
    Call for Immediate Disarmament Agreement
    Xinhua News Agency, January 17th. According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, a delegation of the Italian Peace Movement, headed by Mr. Lu Luchaato, a member of the World Peace Council and a member of parliament, recently visited Warsaw at the invitation of the Polish Committee for the Defense of Peace.
    During the exchange of views, peace advocates from both countries indicated that they were in complete agreement on a number of major issues concerning the peace movement. In a statement issued on the 15th, the representatives of both sides said that reaching a disarmament agreement, especially an agreement on the prohibition of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, and an agreement on the cessation of testing of such weapons, were the most important and urgent issues currently related to the consolidation of peace. Both delegations expressed particular interest in the suggestion of a meeting between representatives of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty, and considered that it would be beneficial if neutral countries could participate in such negotiations. Representatives of the Polish and Italian organizations for the defense of peace attached great importance to the efforts made to sign treaties of mutual non-aggression.
    The Italian peace advocates believe that if the relevant parties adopted the Polish proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, this would be an important first step on the road to achieving complete disarmament and eliminating the threat of atomic war.

    意波两国和平运动代表
    呼吁立即达成裁军协议
    新华社17日讯  据波兰通讯社报道，应波兰保卫和平委员会邀请，以世界和平理事会理事、议员卢·卢查托为首的意大利和平运动代表团最近访问了华沙。
    两国和平人士在交换意见中表明，双方对和平运动的一些重大问题的看法完全一致。双方代表在15日发表的一项声明说，达成裁军协议、特别是关于禁止原子武器和热核武器的协议，以及达成关于停止试验这种武器的协议，是当前同巩固和平有关的最重要的迫切问题。双方代表团对北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约缔约国代表会见的建议特别感到兴趣，并且认为，如果中立国能参加这种谈判将很有益处。波兰和意大利保卫和平运动组织的代表们，十分重视为了签订互不侵犯条约而作的种种努力。
    意大利的和平人士认为，如果有关方面采纳了波兰关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议，那末这在争取全面裁军和消除原子战争威胁的道路上将是重要的第一步。
