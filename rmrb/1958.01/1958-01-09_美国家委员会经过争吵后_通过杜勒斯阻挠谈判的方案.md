Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Washington: The U.S. government's decision-making body, the National Security Council, held a meeting on the 6th to discuss issues such as U.S.-Soviet relations. Prior to this meeting, there had been a long period of behind-the-scenes struggle within the U.S. government. According to U.S. newspapers, on one side of the struggle was Secretary of State Dulles, who was trying to obstruct negotiations with the Soviet Union, and on the other side was Harold Stassen, the President's advisor on disarmament issues, who insisted that the U.S. should adopt a new attitude towards negotiations.

U.S. officials are keeping silent about the discussions at the meeting on the 6th. According to U.S. news agencies, Stassen presented his views at the meeting, but the meeting ultimately passed the draft reply to Bulganin proposed by Dulles. A U.S. State Department spokesman said on the 7th that this draft reply has been submitted to the North Atlantic Council's Standing Group meeting scheduled for the 8th for discussion.

U.S. newspapers have not revealed much about the content of the adopted draft reply. The "New York Times" reported on the 7th that the U.S. government has decided "to conditionally reject the Soviet proposal to hold a summit meeting between Eastern and Western governments and to sign a mutual non-aggression treaty."

According to "Newsday," Dulles wants to propose only a negotiation procedure that he believes will obviously be rejected by the Soviet Union. He rejected the Soviet proposal to convene a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss disarmament or to hold a top-level meeting.

Stassen has different opinions on these issues. He believes that Dulles' attitude is "too negative." Stassen believes that any proposals regarding meeting procedures should not be rejected in advance, including convening a special session of the United Nations General Assembly or U.S.-Soviet bilateral high-level talks.

On the issue of disarmament, Dulles opposes changing the U.S. attitude on disarmament and insists on the original U.S. proposals that have brought disarmament negotiations to a standstill. Stassen believes that Dulles' attitude is "too inflexible" and therefore suggests formulating new proposals. He believes that it is more realistic to start by extracting the measures that are least difficult to reach an agreement on from all the disarmament proposals. Stassen specifically suggested that the United States agree to stop testing nuclear weapons and not entangle the agreement on this issue with the resolution of other issues.

Before the meeting on the 6th, American newspapers and radio commentators generally believed that Stassen would fail in the National Security Council because the forces of various factions within the government were too unequal. All those who hope to use expanded military spending plans to prevent the developing U.S. economic recession currently tend to support Dulles.

### 美国家委员会经过争吵后  通过杜勒斯阻挠谈判的方案

    美国家委员会经过争吵后
    通过杜勒斯阻挠谈判的方案
    据新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府的决策机构——国家安全委员会6日举行会议，讨论有关美苏关系等问题。在这次会议举行以前，美国政府内部已经经过了长期的幕后斗争。据美国报刊报道，站在斗争一方的是竭力阻挠同苏联谈判的国务卿杜勒斯，另一方是坚持美国对谈判应当采取新态度的总统裁军问题顾问史塔生。
    美国官方对6日会议上讨论情况秘而不宣。据美国通讯社透露，史塔生在会上陈述了他的观点，但是会议最后还是通过杜勒斯提出的给布尔加宁的复信草案。美国国务院发言人7日说，这个复信草案已提交北大西洋集团常设理事会定于8日举行的会议去讨论。
    美国报刊对通过的复信草案内容透露还不多。“纽约时报”7日报道，美国政府已经决定“有条件地拒绝苏联提出的举行东西方政府首脑会议和签订一项互不侵犯条约的建议”。
    据“新闻日报”说，杜勒斯想仅仅提出一项在他认为显然会被苏联拒绝的谈判程序，他拒绝苏联提出的关于召开联合国大会特别会议来讨论裁军问题或者召开最高级会议的建议。
    史塔生在这些问题上有不同的意见。他认为杜勒斯这种态度“过于消极”。史塔生认为，不应当事先拒绝有关会谈程序的任何建议，其中包括召开联合国大会特别会议或者美苏双边高级会谈的建议。
    在裁军问题上，杜勒斯反对改变美国在裁军问题上的态度，并且坚持那些使裁军谈判陷于僵局的美国原建议。史塔生认为杜勒斯这种态度“太不灵活”，因此建议拟订新的建议。他认为，比较现实的是开始先把那些达成协议困难最小的措施从裁军的全部建议中抽出来。史塔生特别建议美国同意停止试验核武器，不要把这个问题的协议同其他问题的解决纠缠在一起。
    美国报纸和电台评论员们在6日会议以前就普遍认为，史塔生在国家安全委员会中要失败，因为政府内部各派的势力太不均衡。所有那些指望用扩大军费计划来阻止正在发展着的美国经济衰退的人目前都倾向于支持杜勒斯。
