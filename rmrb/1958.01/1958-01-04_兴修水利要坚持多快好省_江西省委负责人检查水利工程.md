Water Conservancy Construction Should Adhere to the Principle of More, Faster, Better, and More Economical
Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee Leader Inspects Water Conservancy Project
(Our Newspaper)讯 (Report) Comrade Yang Shangkui, First Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, inspected the Zoumalong Reservoir under construction in Xinfeng County on December 9. The Zoumalong Reservoir is one of the larger water conservancy and irrigation projects in Jiangxi Province. The reservoir is ten li long and three and a half li wide, with a dam head of eighteen meters high and an estimated storage capacity of approximately 100 million cubic meters. The total investment will be about 900,000 yuan. After completion, it can guarantee that 45,000 mu of land in seven nearby townships and 45 cooperatives will be free from drought for 50 days without rain, and the annual increase in rice production can exceed one million jin. After Comrade Yang Shangkui went deep into the construction site, he found that the cadres and civilian workers were very enthusiastic about building the reservoir, working more than ten hours a day without complaint. However, the leadership of the reservoir project was blind, mainly manifested in starting construction without good designs, resulting in many unforeseen difficulties. Now, there are major problems in terms of completion time, funding, and technology. Failure to solve these problems would cause significant waste of manpower and material resources, leading to public dissatisfaction with the Party and the government. Comrade Yang Shangkui said that from the perspective of the entire province, the enthusiasm for water conservancy construction has been boosted, which is good; but on the other hand, there is blindness. For example, starting construction on the Zoumalong Reservoir without good designs is one instance; in addition, there are phenomena of rebuilding instead of repairing, and attaching importance to large projects while neglecting small ones. He proposed that Party and government leaders at all levels should pay attention to preventing and correcting these issues in the future. Comrade Yang Shangkui also helped arrange the work for the Zoumalong Reservoir and instructed them to strive to complete it before the Spring Festival.

    兴修水利要坚持多快好省
    江西省委负责人检查水利工程
    本报讯　中共江西省委第一书记杨尚奎同志，12月9日到信丰县检查正在兴建的走马龙水库。走马龙水库是江西省较大的水利灌溉工程之一。库身长十华里，宽三华里半，坝首高十八公尺，蓄水量估计一亿立方公尺左右，全部投资约需九十余万元。建成后可保证附近七个乡四十五个社的四万五千亩田五十天不雨不受旱，每年可增收稻谷一百多万斤。杨尚奎同志深入工地后，发现干部、民工建库热情都很饱满，每日工作十多小时毫无怨言。但是，水库工程领导上有盲目性，主要表现未经设计好就先行施工，产生许多想不到的困难，现在完成时间、经费和技术等方面的问题很大。不设法解决就会造成人力财物的重大浪费，招致群众对党和政府的不满。杨尚奎同志说，现在就全省范围来看，兴修水利的劲头已鼓起来了，这是好的；但另一方面有盲目性。如走马龙水库未设计好即施工就是一种；此外还有重新建，轻整修，重大轻小的现象。他提出各级党政领导今后应当注意防止和纠正。杨尚奎同志还帮助走马龙水库安排了工作，并指示他们努力争取在春节前完工。
