    More on Radios
    Tian Ming
    Radios add so much richness to people's lives! No wonder so many people want to buy one. However, when you step into a radio store and see all kinds of colorful radios, you may not know which one to buy. Here, we introduce the performance of some common radios:
    (1) AC Three-Tube Radio. This is the simplest type of radio, with models 303 and 103. When using this type of radio, you need to add an antenna and ground wire to receive broadcasts from stations within 500 miles. Its volume is not very loud, and the tone is not very clear or soft, but the price is relatively cheap, around 60 yuan.
    (2) AC Four-Tube Radio. Currently sold in stores is the Beijing brand AC Four-Tube Radio, which is modeled after the Soviet Moskvich radio. Its characteristic is its small size. Although it only has four tubes, one of the tubes has two functions, so it is equivalent to a five-tube radio. Of course, in terms of the effect of use, it is worse than a five-tube radio. The price of this radio is about 90 yuan, which is only half the price of a five-tube radio.
    (3) AC Five-Tube Radio. There are many types, including the Nanjing-produced Panda brand 505 and 504 models, the Shanghai-produced 155, 552, and 156 models, and the Beijing-produced 101 model. The 505 and 504 models are sometimes also called the Red Star brand, and they all have Bakelite shells. The rest are wooden boxes. The Panda brand and 504 model radios are not only popular in the domestic market but also sold overseas, welcomed by overseas Chinese and praised by international friends. The price of a five-tube radio is about 140 to 180 yuan.
    (4) AC Six-Tube Radio. Currently, there is only the Shanghai brand, produced in Hankou. This is a larger radio. Its characteristics are its magnificent appearance and soft and pleasant tone. The price is 210 yuan.
    (5) AC Seven-Tube Radio. The Dongfanghong (East is Red) brand seven-tube radio is produced in Hankou and is similar in shape and size to the Shanghai brand. However, it has an additional tuning indicator (commonly known as an "eye tube") compared to the Shanghai brand. Both it and the Shanghai brand are well-known products at home and abroad and are often used as gifts for international exchanges.
    There are also four-tube and five-tube DC radios. These will not be discussed in detail here.
    Generally, radios with four or more tubes have medium-wave and short-wave bands. In the evening, you can listen to broadcasts from domestic and foreign radio stations without using an antenna and ground wire. In Beijing, when we turn on a five-tube radio, after 6 pm, we can receive broadcasts from radio stations in Henan, Shanxi, Guangdong, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia, Japan, North Korea, and other places on the medium-wave band (i.e., broadcast band). On the short-wave band, we can receive broadcasts from Japan, North Korea, the Soviet Union, India, etc.
    Generally speaking, a new radio is not easily damaged within one or two years. Each radio comes with a user manual when purchased. It is best to read the instructions carefully before using it. In general, you should pay attention to: 1. Do not overheat the radio. In winter, it can be used continuously for about five or six hours, but in summer it is best not to exceed two to three hours. 2. Do not turn the radio on and off frequently while listening. 3. Do not use excessive force when rotating the knobs. 4. Do not violently shake the radio. 5. The radio should be placed in a dry place with a moderate temperature and out of direct sunlight. 6. For radios with antennas and ground wires, do not listen during thunderstorms and connect the antenna and ground wires together.

    再谈收音机
    天明
    收音机给人们的生活增添了多少丰富的内容呵！难怪许多人都想买一部收音机呢。但是，当你跨进了无线电行的大门，看到各种各样、五光十色的收音机时，却不知道究竟买什么样的收音机好？这里，我们介绍一下一般常见的收音机的性能：
    （一）交流三灯机。这是一种最简单的收音机，有303型和103型两种。用这种收音机的时候，要加上天地线，才能收听到五百里以内各电台的广播。它的音量不大，音调也不大清晰、柔和，但价格较便宜，六十多元就可买一部。
    （二）交流四灯机。目前商店出售的，有北京牌交流四灯机，这是仿照苏联莫斯科人牌收音机制成的。它的特点是小巧玲珑。虽然它只有四个灯，但是其中有一只电子管兼有两种功用，所以相当于一只五灯机。当然，从使用的效果看，它要比五灯机差一些。这种收音机的价格约九十多元，仅仅是五灯机价格的一半。
    （三）交流五灯机。种类很多，有南京产的熊猫牌505型、504型，上海产的155型、552型、156型，北京产的101型等多种。505和504型有时也叫做红星牌，它们都是胶木外壳。其余的都是木箱。熊猫牌和504型这两种收音机不但是国内市场上的宠儿，而且还远销国外，受到华侨们的欢迎和国际友人的好评。五灯机的价格大约在一百四十元到一百八十元之间。
    （四）交流六灯机。目前只有上海牌一种，是汉口的产品。这是一种较大型的收音机。它的特点是外观富丽堂皇，声调柔和动听。价格为二百一十元。
    （五）交流七灯机。东方红牌七灯机是汉口的产品，外形和大小与上海牌相似。但比上海牌多了一只调节指示器（俗称电眼）。它和上海牌都是国内外著名的产品，常被当作国际间馈赠的礼物。
    另外还有四灯和五灯直流收音机。这里不详细谈。
    一般四灯以上的收音机都有中波、短波等波段，在晚间不用天地线也可以收听国内外电台的播音。在北京，我们打开一部五灯机，下午六点以后，用中波段（即广播段）就可以收到河南、山西、广东、上海、内蒙古、日本、朝鲜等地电台的广播。用短波段可以收到日本、朝鲜、苏联、印度……等国外播音。
    一般说来，一部新的收音机在一两年内是不大容易损坏的。购买时每部收音机都附有一本说明书，最好先把使用法看个明白，然后再用。一般应当注意：一、不要使收音机过热。冬天可连续使用约五、六小时，夏天最好不要超过二至三小时。二、收听时不要时开时关。三、旋转各个旋钮时，不要用猛力。四、不要猛烈地振动收音机。五、收音机要放在干燥但温度不高和日光不常照到的地方。六、有天地线的收音机，在雷雨时不要收听，并把天地线接在一起。
