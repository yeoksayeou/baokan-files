    (Reported by Luda Daily) Should we leap forward? Can we leap forward? Dare we leap forward? How should we leap forward? These were the questions encountered by the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant when discussing this year's national plan. After repeated debates, they made affirmative answers to these questions. Now, the leading cadres of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant are confidently organizing the great leap forward in production for 1958.
    The factory's production plan for 1958 has been greatly increased compared to 1957. Among them, the output of the main product—locomotives—increased by 54.6%, that is, from the actual 97 units completed last year, to 150 units. This huge growth rate was not determined from the beginning, but was obtained after they recognized the new situation of national construction, and after continuous discussions, investigations, calculations, and continuous criticism of negative and conservative ideas. Initially, they planned to produce 110 locomotives this year. At that time, they felt that this number was acceptable, because this output had already increased by 23% compared to last year's plan. At the same time, all of this year's production would be construction-type locomotives (out of the 97 locomotives produced last year, 62 were MK1-type locomotives), and the workload of one construction-type locomotive is equal to 1.2 MK1-type locomotives. It seemed that the task was not light. However, the higher authorities required them to further increase the production of locomotives, because the country has a large demand for locomotives in the second five-year plan. At the same time, after the rectification movement, everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm was high, and they wanted to produce as many locomotives as possible for the country. Thus, higher numbers—140 units, 150 units—were put forward again. There was no doubt that the output had to be increased, but which number was both advanced and reliable? At that time, the leadership was uncertain. In order to solve this problem, they organized a group of people to go to the workshops to "摸底" [mō dǐ: get to the bottom of things; investigate]. In the "摸底," they did not simply understand the production capacity, but actively identified the weak links in each workshop and came up with various ways to solve them. For example, in the boiler workshop, other aspects were not a problem, only the repair group was weak. The production section chief discussed with the workshop director and the work section chief, and believed that adding a few people could solve the problem, and people could be adjusted. They calculated the capacity of each workshop in this way, relying on workshop cadres and workers to study and solve the weak links. Finally, it was possible for each workshop to reach 150 units. After discussion at the Party committee meeting, the plan was finally set at 150 units.
    In order to mobilize cadres to show revolutionary enthusiasm and ensure the completion of the 1958 plan, the factory Party committee held a cadre meeting to analyze the current situation and made detailed arrangements for the work in the first quarter of this year. They required cadres to have confidence, determination, courage, enthusiasm, methods, and perseverance, and to earnestly mobilize the masses. In order to achieve this goal, the factory decided to continue to carry out the rectification movement in the first quarter, earnestly do a good job in rectification and reform, and strive for a complete victory in the rectification movement; to take the rectification as the guiding principle for all work, so that all work can be improved a step further through the rectification movement; and to closely integrate the upsurge of rectification and reform with the upsurge of production.
    At present, the cadres of the factory's departments and workshops are discussing the first quarter work plan proposed by the Party committee to ensure the realization of the 1958 production leap forward, so as to formulate the plan for their own workshops. At the same time, workers throughout the factory are also discussing this year's production plan. In the discussion, the workers' enthusiasm was very high, and a upsurge of thinking about ways to break through the key issues was generally set off. The workers in the boiler workshop put forward 48 rationalization proposals in the discussion of the plan, breaking through the key points one by one, ensuring that the number of locomotive boilers produced this year will be more than the national plan.

    能不能跃进？敢不敢跃进？
    大连机车车辆厂反复调查多次辩论
    确定今年机车产量比去年增长54.6％
    本报讯　据旅大日报报道：要不要跃进？能不能跃进？敢不敢跃进？如何跃进？这是大连机车车辆厂讨论今年国家计划时遇到的几个问题。经过多次的辩论，他们对这几个问题都做出了肯定的答复。现在大连机车车辆厂领导干部正在满怀信心地组织1958年的生产大跃进。
    这个工厂1958年的生产计划比1957年有了很大的提高，其中主要品种——机车的产量增加54.6％，即从去年实际完成的九十七台，增加为一百五十台。这一巨大的增长比率，并不是一开始就确定的，而是他们在认清全国建设的新形势以后，经过不断讨论，调查，核算，不断批判消极、保守思想而得来的。最初，他们计划今年生产一百一十台机车。当时，他们认为这个数字还可以，因为这个产量已经比去年的计划提高了23％，同时今年全部是生产建设型机车（去年生产的九十七台机车中有六十二台是冖ㄎ1型机车），而一台建设型机车的工作量等于一点二台冖ㄎ1型机车的工作量。看来，任务不算轻。但是，上级要求他们更高地提高机车的生产量，因为国家在第二个五年计划中对机车的需要量很大。同时，经过整风运动，大家的革命干劲十足，都想尽可能地为国家生产更多的机车。于是更高的数字——一百四十台、一百五十台又被提出来了。产量要提高这是没有疑问的，但是哪一个数字是既先进而又可靠的呢？当时领导上是心中无数的。为了解决这个问题，他们组织一部分人到车间去进行了“摸底”。在“摸底”中，他们不单纯了解生产能力，而是用积极的态度找出每个车间的薄弱环节，并想出各种办法加以解决。如锅炉车间其他方面都不成问题，只有加修组能力薄弱。生产科长找车间主任和工段长一研究，认为增加几个人就可以解决问题，而人是可以调整的。他们就这样一个车间一个车间地核算能力，依靠车间干部和工人研究解决薄弱环节的办法。最后，每个车间都有可能达到一百五十台。经过党委会议讨论，终于把计划订为一百五十台。
    为了动员干部拿出革命的干劲，保证完成1958年计划，工厂党委召开了干部会议，对当前形势作了分析，详细地布置了今年第一季度的工作。他们要求干部有信心，有决心，有勇气，有干劲，有办法，有毅力，并且认真发动群众。为了达到这一目的，工厂决定在第一季度继续开展整风运动，认真做好整改工作，争取整风运动的全胜；以整风做为提起一切工作的纲，使各项工作都能通过整风运动提高一步；把整改高潮同生产高潮密切结合起来。
    目前，这个工厂的科室、车间干部正在讨论党委为保证实现1958年生产大跃进而提出的第一季度工作计划，以便订出本车间的计划。同时，全厂工人也正在讨论今年的生产计划。在讨论中，工人热情十分高涨，普遍掀起了想办法突破关键的热潮。锅炉车间工人在讨论计划中提出了四十八件合理化建议，一一突破了关键，保证今年生产的机车锅炉比国家计划还多。
