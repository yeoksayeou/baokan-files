The grand competition of "Eliminate the Four Pests and Promote Hygiene" launched by the people of the capital on the 15th has already had a significant impact on the lives of people throughout the city. More than 900 units, comprising over one million people, are participating in the competition and are striving to implement the competition conditions they have proposed. Except for a small number of large units with over ten thousand people, most units aim to achieve their formulated "Four-No" plans within this month. This is a historically significant event that will transform the country, change customs, and affect the happiness of future generations.

The participating units, through their advanced examples and the proposed competition conditions – the "Four-No" plans – have also played three roles among the people: First, they show people that the four pests – mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows – can be completely eliminated, and unhygienic customs can be changed. Second, they teach the people specific methods for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene. Third, they renew the thinking and boost the confidence of those who previously made excuses for not actively participating in the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene: If large courtyards, small inns, vegetable markets, wonton stalls, and waiting rooms can eliminate the four pests and maintain good hygiene, are there any units with more difficult conditions than these?

Therefore, the reporters have specifically collected fifteen different types of challenge and response letters from residential areas, government agencies, military units, schools, factories, large courtyards, public places, vegetable markets, hotels, cinemas, restaurants, barber shops, grain stores, and other participants in the "Eliminate the Four Pests and Promote Hygiene" grand competition.
