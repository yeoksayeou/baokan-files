Xinhua News Agency, January 28th. TASS Cairo, January 27th: Egypt's "Al Akhbar" reports that some Iraqi parliamentarians are demanding that Iraq withdraw from the Baghdad Pact and that the government change its pro-Western policy and adopt a policy of national independence.

    Leader of the opposition in the House of Representatives, Hassan, said that Iraq "has not benefited in any way from participating in the Baghdad Pact." He compared Iraq's poor economic situation with the great achievements made by Egypt and Syria, which pursue policies of guaranteeing complete independence and developing national economies.

    Parliamentarian Sami Bashalim emphasized in parliament that "the goals of most members of the Baghdad Pact are contrary to the interests of the Arabs." He demanded that the government "implement a clear Arab nationalist policy."

    Parliamentarian Omar Nazmi accused the government's policy of "relying on the West, but the West is pursuing a policy against Arab countries." Nazmi, condemning Iraq's participation in the Baghdad Pact, said: "The Baghdad Pact is the root cause of divisions among Arab countries. This treaty is used by other countries to interfere in Iraq's internal affairs. In the past, we suffered from British rule, and now members of the Baghdad Pact are putting pressure on us." He demanded "a complete change in Iraq's policy" and the adoption of the policy pursued by independent Arab countries.

    Parliamentarians Ismail Ghanem and Abdul Muhsin Daouri also demanded that Iraq withdraw from the Baghdad Pact.

Xinhua News Agency, January 28th. TASS Beirut, January 27th: According to "Al Akhbar," 10,000 people in Lebanon have signed a petition against the establishment of atomic and rocket bases in Lebanon.

    The newspaper also said that protest letters and petitions are pouring into the newspaper's editorial office from all over the country. They unanimously condemn the American conspiracy to establish rocket bases in Lebanon. Lebanese Parliamentarian Mazharani said: "Allowing the establishment of rocket and atomic bases in Lebanon violates the principle of neutrality and will turn our country into a rocket target with all its consequences."

    Parliamentarian Murtaada emphasized: "Lebanon's security lies in neutrality." Parliamentarian Khatib also pointed out: "Any government that allows the establishment of rocket weapons bases in its country is an enemy of its own homeland."

Xinhua News Agency, January 27th. According to the Indian Press Trust Beirut: Political figures in Beirut said on the 24th that the Lebanese cabinet has experienced "serious differences" on the government's foreign policy, and some ministers have threatened to resign because of this issue.

    The person said that Lebanese cabinet members are uneasy about the recent explosions in the capital. It is generally believed that these events are a manifestation of protests against the country's pro-Western foreign policy.

    It is said that Prime Minister Solh has asked the relevant ministers not to resign, as he fears that a collective resignation may lead to his downfall.

    伊拉克议员要求退出巴格达条约
    黎巴嫩公众反对建立火箭基地
  　索勒哈内阁在外交上发生分歧
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社开罗27日讯：埃及“消息报”报道，伊拉克一些议员要求伊拉克退出巴格达条约，并且要求政府改变亲西方的政策，采取民族独立的政策。
    众议院反对党领袖哈桑说，伊拉克“从参加巴格达条约这件事上没有得到任何好处”。他把伊拉克穷困的经济状况同执行保障完全独立和发展民族经济政策的埃及和叙利亚所取得的巨大成就作了一番比较。
    议员萨米·巴沙利姆在议会中强调指出，“巴格达条约大多数成员国的目标是违背阿拉伯人的利益的”。他要求政府“执行明确的阿拉伯民族政策”。
    议员欧默尔·纳兹米指责说，政府的政策是“依靠西方，但是西方却执行反对阿拉伯国家的政策”。纳兹米在谴责伊拉克参加巴格达条约时说：“巴格达条约是阿拉伯国家产生分歧的根源。这个条约被其他国家用来干涉伊拉克的内政。过去我们受着英国的统治的痛苦，而现在巴格达条约成员国又对我们施加压力”。他要求“彻底改变伊拉克的政策”并且采取独立的阿拉伯国家所执行的政策。
    议员伊斯梅尔·加奈姆和阿卜杜勒·莫辛·达乌里也要求伊拉克退出巴格达条约。
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社贝鲁特27日讯：据“消息报”报道，黎巴嫩已经有一万人在请愿书上签了名，反对在黎巴嫩境内建立原子和火箭基地。
    这家报纸还说，抗议信和请愿书从全国各地雪片似地纷纷寄到报纸的编辑部。它们一致谴责美国要在黎巴嫩建立火箭基地的阴谋。黎巴嫩议会议员马扎拉尼说：“允许在黎巴嫩境内建立火箭和原子基地是违背中立原则的，并且会把我国变成产生一切后果的火箭目标”。
    议员木尔塔达强调指出：“黎巴嫩的安全在于中立”。议员哈提布也指出：“允许在本国建立火箭武器基地的任何政府都是自己祖国的敌人”。
    新华社27日讯　据印度报业托辣斯贝鲁特消息：贝鲁特的政界人士24日说，黎巴嫩内阁在政府的外交政策方面发生了“严重的分歧”，有些部长们因为这个问题而扬言要辞职。
    这位人士说，黎巴嫩内阁阁员们对最近在首都发生的一些爆炸事件感到不安。人们普遍认为，这些事件是抗议这个国家倾向西方的外交政策的表现。
    据说索勒哈总理要求各有关部长不要辞职，因为他担心发生集体辞职可能使他下台。
