    Plum Blossom
    The flowers bloom, the world is full of wind and snow,
    Freezing to death the people in Chang'an city.
    Laughing at the peony's lack of blessed fate,
    Although warm when it blooms, spring is already fading.

    Double Pines Standing in Snow Painting
    The year ends, the cold wind is fierce,
    Tall pines stand in ice and snow.
    People know it withers last,
    But don't see its integrity throughout.

    (When pines are small, their branches are sometimes cut, but several inches must be left to ensure the pine does not die. When the tree grows larger, the remaining branches are wrapped inside the tree, and cannot be seen from the outside.)

    One-Legged Stool
    The village shepherd sits,
    On a single leg.
    Arms relaxed, lying down,
    Who will support him?
    He sits steadily himself.

    Inscription on a Painting Scroll of My Friend Leng'an
    Facing your scroll, I feel for the past,
    Smashing the golden goblet, the country is pitiful.
    Under the lamp, I look again and again with tears,
    China has no such complete mountains and rivers.

    A Descendant of Old Man Fan Shan Learns to Paint
    A painting of mulberry picking, requesting a poem:
    Few mulberry leaves on the Sanggan, returning late,
    People and silkworms are hungry, with something to think about.
    Those who greedily embroider mandarin ducks on clothes,
    How do they know to sell new silk in the fifth month?

    Past Events Shown to My Children
    Village books without promise, a delayed fate,
    At twenty-seven, I finally had a teacher.
    A lamp without oil, what does it matter?
    I burned pine branches to read Tang books myself.

    (I suffered from poverty in my youth, and only at the age of twenty-seven did I have two teachers, Hu Qinyuan and Chen Shaofan. Wang Zhongyan was my fellow student and also a teacher. In the morning, I worked as a carpenter, and at night I read books by the light of pine fires.)

    白石老人的诗
    梅花
    花开天下正风雪
    冷杀长安市上人
    笑倒牡丹无福命
    开时虽暖已残春
    双松立雪图
    岁暮寒风烈
    长松立冰雪
    人知心后凋
    不见通身节
    松小时或砍其枝，必留数寸，以保松之不死，树长大，所留枝包在树内，皮外不得见。
    独脚凳
  　吾乡牧童坐者
    独脚一个
    散手倒卧
    谁为扶持
    自家稳坐
    题友人冷庵画卷
    对君斯册感当年
    撞破金瓯国可怜
    镫下再三挥泪看
    中华无此整山川
    樊山老人后人学画
    采桑图乞题句
    桑干叶少得归迟
    人并蚕饥有所思
    贪把鸳鸯绣衣者
    那知五月卖新丝
    往事示儿辈
    村书无角宿缘迟
    廿七年华始有师
    镫盏无油何害事
    自烧松火读唐书
    余少苦贫，二十七岁始得胡沁园、陈少蕃二师，王仲言社弟兼师也。朝为木工，夜则以松火读书。
