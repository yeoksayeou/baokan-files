Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 30th. The hypothesis that stars originate from thin, cloud-like matter is unfounded. Stars and nebulae may have a common origin, produced by "stellar embryos." This is the new perspective on the origin of stars recently published by prominent Soviet astronomer Viktor Ambartsumian in the "Bulletin of the USSR Academy of Sciences."

As everyone knows, the Sun, including the nine major planets, satellites, asteroids, comets, meteors, etc., that make up the solar system. The solar system is a member of the entire Milky Way. The Milky Way contains many different types of stars, nebulae, cosmic dust, etc. In 1947, Ambartsumian discovered the existence of stellar associations in the Milky Way. A stellar association is a group of stars composed of certain stars with common physical properties. Stellar associations can also be divided into several star groups.

Ambartsumian said that it has now been determined that the average age of stars in the Milky Way is less than tens of billions of years, while the age of the Earth and the Sun is at least several billion years. According to studies of stellar associations within the Milky Way, it has been found that stellar associations are constantly deforming and disintegrating, and it has been determined that the age of the member stars of stellar associations is only one hundred to five million years, and some star groups are even less than one million years old. Compared with the age of the entire Milky Way, they are simply newborn babies. From these, it can be determined that stars are still being produced within the Milky Way.

So what is the origin of stars? In the past, there was a hypothesis that star clusters were produced by nebulae, but no direct evidence of nebulae transforming into stars was found. On the contrary, there is direct evidence showing that stars and nebulae have a common origin, and after formation, star groups and nebulae begin to expand together. Ambartsumian calls this common origin "stellar embryos."

Speaking of "stellar embryos," Ambartsumian said that since they have not yet been observed, he dares not say what they are. However, it can be imagined that the interior of a stellar embryo contains high energy, and its mass is large enough to form an entire star group and nebula, and its density is so high that it may approach the density of atomic nuclei. Star groups are formed by the splitting of stellar embryos into many pieces. The split proto-stellar matter blocks are unstable, and they rapidly transform into ordinary matter, forming stars, while the original stellar embryo matter remaining around the stars forms nebulae. He said that this is only a very rudimentary hypothesis.

Ambartsumian said that the properties of proto-stellar matter may be essentially different from known matter, and it is difficult to explain these new characteristics based on existing knowledge of elementary particles. It can be assumed that the outbursts of young eruptive stars are due to the occasional transport of energy-carrying matter from the inner layers of the star to the outer edge of the atmosphere; this matter is a trace of some part of the proto-stellar matter. Observations show that high-velocity particle blocks are ejected from the central star of the Crab Nebula, and these particle blocks produce continuous emission. It should be a remnant of a stellar embryo. Based on the study of the nuclei of giant galaxies, it can also be concluded that there is a large amount of proto-stellar matter in the core of the galaxy.

### 苏联天文学家发表新见解  恒星起源于“星胎”

    苏联天文学家发表新见解
    恒星起源于“星胎”
    新华社莫斯科30日电　恒星起源于稀薄的云状物质的假说是毫无根据的，恒星和星云可能有着共同的起源，是由“星胎”产生的，这是苏联著名天文学家阿姆巴楚米扬最近在“苏联科学院通报”上发表的对恒星起源的新见解。
    大家知道，太阳、包括地球在内的九大行星、卫星、小行星、彗星、流星等合组成太阳系。而太阳系又是整个银河中的一个成员。银河系中包括许多不同型的恒星、星云、宇宙尘等。1947年，阿姆巴楚米扬发现了银河系中有星协存在。星协是由某些具有共同物理性质的恒星组成的恒星集团。星协还可以分成几种星组。
    阿姆巴楚米扬说，现在确定了银河系恒星平均年龄不到几百亿年，而地球和太阳的年龄至少有几十亿年。根据对银河系内星协的研究发现，星协正在不断地变形和瓦解，并且确定了星协成员星的年龄只是一百到五百万年，有的星组年龄还在一百万年以下。与整个银河系年龄比起来，它们简直是新生婴儿。由这些可以确定，银河系内恒星还在继续产生。
    那末恒星的起源是什么呢？过去，曾经有过一种假说，认为星群是由星云产生的，但是并没有找到星云转变为恒星的直接证据，相反却有直接事实表明，恒星和星云有着共同的起源，而且在形成以后，星组和星云一起开始膨胀。阿姆巴楚米扬把这种共同起源叫做“星胎”。
    谈到“星胎”时，阿姆巴楚米扬说，由于目前还未观测到，不敢说它是什么。不过可以设想，星胎内部包含着高能量，其质量大到可以形成整个星组和星云，密度大到可能接近于原子核的密度。星组是由星胎分裂成许多块而成的。分裂开的星前物质块是不稳定的，它们迅速转变为普通物质，形成恒星，而残留在恒星外围的原始星胎物质形成星云。他说，这只是极简陋形式的假说。
    阿姆巴楚米扬说，星前物质的性质可能和已知的物质有本质的不同，根据现有的关于基本粒子的性质，难以解释这些新的特性。可以假定，年青的爆发星的爆发，是由于携带能量的物质偶而从恒星的内层被运向大气的外边缘，这种物质是星前物质的某一部分痕迹。观测证明，从蟹状星云的中央星里有速度很大的质点块抛出，这些质点块产生连续发射。它应该是星胎的残迹。根据对巨形星系的核的研究，也可以得出星系的核心内有大量星前物质的结论。
