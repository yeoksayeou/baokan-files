Striving to Further Strengthen and Develop Soviet-Chinese Friendship
Vice Chairman of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, Peileweitailuo

    On October 29, 1957, as the Soviet people were preparing to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association was established in Moscow, based on the initiative of a group of social activists and social organizations.

    The establishment of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association is a significant step in the cause of developing and strengthening the fraternal friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples:

    First, Soviet-Chinese friendship is a great historical achievement of the working people of the Soviet Union and China, grown and strengthened in the struggle against common enemies. This friendship will forever be the most important condition for the achievements of the two peoples in the revolutionary struggle and in building a new socialist society. The ideas of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism are the deepest source of the great friendship between the two peoples, becoming the most solid foundation of this friendship.

    The historical roots of Soviet-Chinese friendship have a long history. Before the revolution, the sympathy of advanced figures in Russia always belonged to the Chinese people who heroically resisted enslavement. Represented by the Bolsheviks led by Lenin, a major social force had formed in Russia before the October Revolution, a social force that could see the true revolutionary significance of the Chinese people's liberation.

    The victory of the October Socialist Revolution in Russia, for the first time in history, opened up the possibility of establishing true friendship between peoples of all countries. The ardent hope of the various nationalities of the Soviet state to establish and develop equal and fraternal relations with the Chinese people was fully reflected in the policies of the world's first socialist country: the policy of friendship with China and friendship with the Chinese people became the national policy of the Soviet government. This policy was unanimously approved and warmly supported by the advanced forces in China—Sun Yat-sen, the Chinese Communist Party, and all progressives.

    Now, in the political, economic, and cultural life of the Soviet Union and China, the pulse of our people's deep friendship is felt everywhere, and the results of their creative cooperation, mutual assistance, and support are seen everywhere.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, friendly relations between the two countries have greatly expanded. Cooperation of various natures has been widely developed. Friendly delegations from both countries have visited each other, including many outstanding activists, representatives of various state and social organizations, and thousands of ordinary citizens: workers, farmers, artists, and so on. The Soviet Union has published millions of copies of the works of Chinese social activists, thinkers, scholars, and artists, including the works of Mao Zedong and other leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, and has staged Chinese films and plays. Our Chinese friends have specially published Russian-language publications for the Soviet Union: the "Friendship" weekly and the "People's Pictorial," which are widely circulated among Soviet readers. Many Soviet writers are engaged in writing about China. Soviet publications and radio stations frequently publish many materials about People's China.

    One of the most obvious characteristics of the Soviet people's friendly relations with the Chinese people is the most sincere love for their Chinese brothers, eager to know as much as possible about the life of the Chinese people: about their great achievements in building a new life, about the great historical significance of their experience in building socialism according to the country's specific conditions, about the creative application and development of Marxist-Leninist theory, about the extraordinarily rich Chinese culture of many centuries, and about the great role of People's China in the struggle to defend world peace and consolidate the socialist peace camp. The Soviet people firmly believe that the fraternal, unbreakable Soviet-Chinese friendship has great worldwide historical significance for the destiny of our two countries and all mankind.

    Second, the establishment of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association meets the urgent need for further development of friendly relations between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. The work of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association will be a new link in the various aspects of relations already established between the Soviet Union and China. The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association has set itself the following important tasks: to promote the further development and consolidation of the fraternal friendship between our two great nations; to expand cultural cooperation, while fully exchanging experiences in cultural construction with the People's Republic of China; to more widely introduce the life of the Chinese people and their experience in building socialism to Soviet society; to help the Chinese people understand the life and labor of the Soviet people in many aspects. The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association will publish the "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" weekly in Chinese. We will strive to make our publication meet the needs of Chinese readers and to gain the same welcome among them as the "Friendship" weekly published in Beijing has gained among Soviet readers.

    The many responses received by the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association from various social organizations and Soviet citizens prove that the organization of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association is receiving a huge and enthusiastic welcome from the Soviet people.

    On this historically significant day celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, many outstanding events indicate that Soviet-Chinese friendship is further flourishing. The Soviet people welcomed the People's Republic of China delegation headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, who came to the Soviet Union to participate in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, with particularly excited hearts. The Soviet people were happy to welcome our distinguished guests—revolutionary activists and leaders of the fraternal Friendship Association, Soong Ching Ling, Guo Moruo, Liu Ningyi, Qian Junrui, and other comrades. In those days, our two countries signed new important documents—the Soviet-Chinese Cultural Cooperation Agreement and the Soviet-Chinese Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement—further developing the fraternal cooperation between our two peoples.

    The meetings between the leaders of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association and the Chinese-Soviet Friendship Association in Moscow and Beijing were of great significance to the initial work of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association. These meetings established friendly contacts and exchanged views on the activities of the fraternal Friendship Associations.

    During the festival of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the visit of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association delegation headed by Andreyev to China was of great significance. Chairman Mao Zedong received the delegation, and the representatives visited various parts of China, widely meeting and talking with Chinese social activists, workers, farmers, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, and representatives of intellectuals. At the same time, the delegation met with the leaders of the Chinese-Soviet Friendship Association, Soong Ching Ling and other leaders. Like all Soviet people who have been to China, the members of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association returned to their motherland with warm praise for the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in a short period of time, and with deep love for Chinese friends and brothers. Undoubtedly, the rich experience of the Chinese-Soviet Friendship Association will be of great significance to the future work of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association.

    In the New Year of 1958, on behalf of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, we extend fraternal greetings to all members of the Chinese-Soviet Friendship Association and to our Chinese friends, and wish them new achievements in socialist construction, strengthening the country, consolidating our fraternal friendship, and striving for world peace.

    争取进一步加强和发展苏中友谊
    苏中友好协会副主席　佩雷维尔塔伊洛
    1957年10月29日，苏联人民在准备庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，根据一批社会活动家和社会团体的发起，在莫斯科成立了苏中友好协会。
    苏中友好协会的成立，是在发展和加强联系苏联人民和中国人民兄弟般的友谊事业中的重大步骤：
    一，苏中友谊是苏联和中国劳动人民的伟大的历史成果，在反对共同敌人的斗争中成长和加强起来的，这种友谊永远是两国人民在革命斗争中，在建设新的社会主义社会中取得成就的最重要的条件。马克思列宁主义的思想、无产阶级国际主义的思想是两国人民的伟大友谊的最深的源泉，成为这种友谊的最牢固的基础。
    苏中友谊的历史根源由来已久。革命前，俄国先进人物的同情永远是属于英勇反抗奴役者的中国人民方面的。以列宁所领导的布尔什维克为代表，在十月革命前的俄国，已形成了一种主要的社会力量，这种社会力量能够看出中国人民解放的真正革命意义。
    十月社会主义革命在俄国的胜利，第一次在历史上开辟了各国人民之间建立真正友谊的可能性。苏维埃国家的各族人民，对于建立和发展同中国人民平等的兄弟关系的热切希望，在世界上第一个社会主义国家的政策上得到了完全的反应：同中国友好，同中国人民友好的政策成为苏联政府的国家政策。这个政策得到了中国先进力量——孙中山、中国共产党、全体进步人士的一致赞同和热烈支持。
    现在，在苏中两国政治、经济和文化生活中，无处不感到我们人民的深刻友谊的脉搏在跳动，无处不看到他们创造性的合作、互相帮助和支持的成果。
    自从中华人民共和国成立以后，两国间的友好联系大大扩大了。各种不同性质的合作得到了广泛的发展。友好代表团互相访问了两国，参加代表团的有许多卓越的活动家、各种国家和社会组织的代表、成千的普通公民：工人、农民、艺术工作者等等。苏联成百万册地出版了中国社会活动家、思想家、学者和艺术家们的作品，出版了毛泽东和中共其他领导人的作品，上演了中国影片和话剧。我们的中国朋友专门为苏联出版了俄文刊物：“友好”周刊、“人民画报”，这些刊物在苏联读者中广泛地流传。许多苏联作家从事关于中国的写作。苏联刊物和广播电台经常发表许多关于人民中国的材料。
    苏联人民对中国人民友好关系最明显的特点之一，就是最真挚地爱自己的中国兄弟，渴望着尽多知道中国人民的生活：关于他们在建设新生活中的巨大成就，关于按照国家特殊条件建设社会主义方面的巨大历史意义的经验，关于创造性地运用和发展马列主义理论，关于异常丰富的中国许多世纪的文化，关于人民中国在保卫世界和平斗争和团结巩固社会主义和平阵营中的伟大作用。苏联人民坚决相信兄弟般的、牢不可破的苏中友谊，对我们两国和全人类的命运有着巨大的全世界的历史意义。
    二，苏中友好协会的成立，是符合进一步发展苏中人民友好关系的迫切要求的。苏中友协的工作将是苏中两国之间已经建立的各方面联系中的新环节。苏中友协给自己提出的重要任务如下：促进我们两大民族之间的兄弟友谊的进一步发展和巩固；扩大文化合作，同时与中华人民共和国全面交换文化建设经验；更广泛地向苏联社会介绍中国人民的生活和他们建设社会主义的经验；帮助中国人民多方面了解苏联人民的生活和劳动。苏中友协将以中文出版“苏中友好”周刊。我们将努力使得我们的刊物满足中国读者的需要，并且要在他们中间获得像北京出版的“友好”周刊在苏联读者中所获得的同样的欢迎。
    苏中友协从各社会团体和苏联公民那里收到的很多反应证明，苏中友协组织是受到苏联人民巨大而热情的欢迎。
    在庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年这个具有历史意义的日子里，有许多杰出的事件表明着苏中友谊正在进一步繁荣。苏联人民怀着特别激动的心情欢迎了以毛泽东主席为首的、来苏联参加十月革命四十周年庆典的人民中国代表团。苏联人民高兴地欢迎了我们的贵宾——革命活动家和兄弟友协领导人宋庆龄、郭沫若、刘宁一、钱俊瑞以及其他同志。在那些日子里我们两国签订了新的重要文件——苏中文化合作协定、苏中科学技术合作协定——使我们两国人民之间兄弟般的合作获得了更进一步的发展。
    苏中友协和中苏友协领导人在莫斯科和北京两地的会见，对苏中友协初期的工作有着很大的意义，这些会见建立了友好的接触，相互之间交换了兄弟友协活动方面的意见。
    在伟大十月社会主义革命的节日里，以安德烈耶夫为首的苏中友协代表团访问中国有着重大的意义。毛泽东主席接见了代表团，代表们访问了中国各地，广泛地和中国社会活动家、工人、农民、人民解放军战士和军官们以及知识分子的代表们会了面和谈了话。同时，代表团又会见了中苏友协领导人宋庆龄和其他领导人。正像所有到过中国的苏联人一样，苏中友协的团员们带着对中国人民在中国共产党领导下在短期间取得巨大成就的热烈赞扬，带着深深热爱中国朋友和兄弟的心情回到了祖国。无疑地，中苏友协的丰富经验对今后苏中友协的工作将有巨大的意义。
    在1958年新年里，我们代表苏中友协向中苏友协所有会员，向中国朋友致兄弟般的敬意，并祝他们在社会主义建设、巩固国家、巩固我们之间的兄弟友谊和争取世界和平事业中取得新的成就。
