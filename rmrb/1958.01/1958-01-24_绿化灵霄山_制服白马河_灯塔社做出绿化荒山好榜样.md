    Reported by our newspaper: The Lighthouse Agricultural Cooperative of Baima River Township, Xingtai County, Hebei Province, in the first year after becoming an advanced cooperative, took the lead in creating a "10,000-Mu Forest" and successfully completed the "10,000-Mu Forest" in a short period, setting a good example in greening barren mountains.
    The creation of the "10,000-Mu Forest" by the Lighthouse Cooperative was prompted by the effort to manage the White Horse River. Baima River Township is located in the upper reaches of the notorious White Horse River. Within its boundaries lies a large barren mountain called Mount Lingxiao. The area is plagued by "droughts when there is no rain, and floods when there is rain." Mountain floods often wash away fertile fields. The local people have two folk songs: "Living by the White Horse River, we starve nine years out of ten. Good water cannot be used, and floods bring disaster!" and "Bare mountains and dry riverbeds, the White Horse runs wild onto the plains, washing away riverside land and flooding thousands of acres!" Managing the White Horse River has been the desire of the local people for many years. In the winter of 1955, shortly after the merger and upgrade of nineteen primary cooperatives into the Lighthouse Agricultural Cooperative, Wang Zhiying, the secretary of the Youth League Branch of the cooperative, attended the National Congress of Active Youth in Socialist Construction. After returning to the county, he first proposed large-scale afforestation and greening of Mount Lingxiao. His proposal was supported by the county Party and government leadership, as well as the township Party branch and the cooperative's management committee. With the assistance of the district committee and the forest management office, the Lighthouse Cooperative planned Mount Lingxiao and decided to plant 10,000 mu of forest on the mountain. At the time, a few cooperative members were unconvinced about afforestation on barren mountains. The township Party committee relied on young activists to carry out ideological education among the members. People cited the basis for the success of afforestation on Mount Lingxiao, such as the apricot trees planted by Wang Shunhua, a farmer in the township, on the barren Nan Mountain (part of Mount Lingxiao) a few years ago, which are now flowering and bearing fruit. In 1954, Shicao Village in the township planted 2,000 mu of mountain apricots in Xigou. After the mountain was closed off, the trees had grown three to five feet tall, and the soil erosion in the surrounding area had been greatly reduced. Through propaganda and education, cooperative members realized that "greening Mount Lingxiao is to put a halter on the White Horse (River)." Some said, "Conquering the White Horse River will benefit future generations." After the afforestation plan was approved at the members' meeting, the cooperative established an afforestation management committee, formulated forest protection covenants, and determined a method of periodically opening the mountain for grass cutting during the closure period. These measures dispelled the concerns of some people about "afforestation cannot be protected" and "no firewood to burn when afforestation closes the mountain." The 10,000-mu forest required a lot of seeds. Although the commissioner's office gave several thousand catties of oak seeds, it was still not enough. Later, according to the instructions of the township Party committee, a "handful of seeds" campaign was launched throughout the cooperative to mobilize the masses to collect tree seeds. In a few days, more than 4,600 catties of apricot kernels were collected.
    After the seeds were gathered, the afforestation headquarters, consisting of 22 people from various departments, was established. Tian Chunrong, deputy secretary of the Party branch, served as director, and Feng Zhengang, deputy township chief, and Wang Zhiying, secretary of the Youth League branch, served as deputy directors. On February 24, 1956, in heavy snow, an afforestation army of 2,400 men and women from the entire cooperative set out. The 830 members of the Youth League and young people formed 28 youth shock brigades. Red flags fluttered on the mountain, and gongs and drums shook the sky. After seven days of hard work, 13,500 mu of apricot and oak trees were sown. During the rainy season of that year, the Lighthouse Cooperative mobilized more than 1,500 people to carry out soil loosening and weeding in the forest area. Thanks to the careful protection and cultivation by the cooperative members, 70%-80% of the planted trees survived. In the autumn and winter of that year, the cooperative planted another 4,000 mu of forest on Mount Lingxiao.
    The Xingtai County Committee of the Communist Party of China conscientiously summarized the experience of the Lighthouse Cooperative in creating the "10,000-Mu Forest" and organized cadres of mountainous cooperatives to visit and study Mount Lingxiao. In the past two years, many mountainous agricultural cooperatives in Hebei Province have learned from the example of the Lighthouse Cooperative and actively carried out large-scale afforestation. Now, there are already twenty-eight "10,000-Mu Forest Cooperatives" in the province. (Zhang Xinjian, Li Zhizhou, Guo Kanging)

    绿化灵霄山  制服白马河
    灯塔社做出绿化荒山好榜样
    本报讯　河北省邢台县白马河乡灯塔农业合作社在高级合作化后的第一年，首倡营造“万亩林”，并在短期内把“万亩林”营造成功，做出了绿化荒山的榜样。
    灯塔社营造“万亩林”是由治理白马河引起的。白马河乡位于有名的害河——白马河的上游，境内有一座大荒山，叫灵霄山。这里是“无雨旱灾，有雨水灾”。山洪经常冲走良田。当地群众中流传着这样两首歌谣：“住在白马河，十年九挨饿，好水不能用，洪水生灾祸！”“光山秃岭干河滩，白马脱缰下平原，沿路冲走河川地，洪水淹没万顷田！”治理白马河是当地人民多少年来的愿望。1955年冬季，十九个初级社合并升级组成了一个灯塔农业社不久，这个社的青年团总支书记王志英参加了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，回县后首先提出了大面积造林、绿化灵霄山的建议。他的倡议得到了县党政领导机关的支持和乡党总支、社管理委员会的同意。在区委和森林经营所的帮助下，灯塔社对灵霄山进行了规划，决定在这座山上造林一万亩。当时有少数社员对于荒山造林想不通。乡党委依靠青年积极分子向社员们进行了思想教育。人们举出了灵霄山造林可以成功的根据。如几年前该乡农民王顺华在瘠薄的南山（灵霄山的一部分）上种的杏树，现在已经开花结果；该乡石槽村1954年在西沟种了二千亩山杏，封山以后，树已经长了三尺至五尺高，附近的水土冲刷情况大大减轻。经过宣传教育，社员们认识到：“绿化灵霄山，是为了给白马（河）带笼头”。有的说：“征服白马河，造福子孙万代。”造林计划在社员大会上通过以后，社就成立了造林管理委员会，制订了护林公约，确定了在封山期间定期开山割草的办法。这些措施，解除了某些人的“造林保不住”和“造林封山没柴烧”的顾虑。万亩林需要种子很多，虽然专署给了几千斤橡树种，还是不够用。后来又根据乡党委的指示，在全社开展了“一把籽”运动，发动群众采集树种。几天工夫就收集到杏核四千六百多斤。
    种子凑够了以后，由各部门二十二人组成的造林指挥部成立了。党总支副书记田春荣任主任，副乡长冯振岗和团总支书记王志英任副主任。1956年2月24日，大雪纷飞，全社二千四百名男女劳动力组成的造林大军出动了。全社八百三十名团员、青年组成了二十八个青年突击队。山上红旗飘扬，锣鼓震天。经过七天的努力，播种了一万三千五百亩杏树和橡树。当年雨季，灯塔社又动员了一千五百多人到林地普遍进行了松土除草。由于社员们经心保护和抚育，种下的树70％—80％都活了。这年的秋、冬两季，这个社又在灵霄山造林四千亩。
    中共邢台县委认真总结了灯塔社营造“万亩林”的经验，并组织山区合作社干部到灵霄山参观、学习。两年来，河北省许多山区农业社学习灯塔社的榜样，积极进行了大面积造林。现在，全省已经出现了二十八个“万亩林社”　（张新建、栗之周、郭康庆）
