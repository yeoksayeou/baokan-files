    Labor Training in the Hygiene Campaign
    Ying Tianchang
    Labor training is necessary for everyone, and it is the main way for intellectuals and state cadres engaged in mental work to transform themselves at present.
    Labor training is multifaceted, including agricultural labor, industrial labor, and self-service labor, etc. Intellectuals can be trained in various physical labors. Of course, the most important labor training is participation in industrial and agricultural production, especially agricultural production. At present, a large number of intellectuals and state cadres have gone to factories and rural areas, full of confidence in transforming themselves into working-class intellectuals through labor.
    There are still a large number of intellectuals and state cadres who have not directly participated in labor training in industrial and agricultural production.
    Does this mean they have no way to train themselves? No. At least from the current vigorous anti-four pests and hygiene campaign, they can be trained in this process.
    The anti-four pests and hygiene campaign is a nationwide, widespread, and collective movement, and it is also a labor with self-service characteristics. Because, to truly eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene, everyone must take action; one person cannot do it alone. However, strictly speaking, eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene is everyone's own business, related to everyone's own safety. Therefore, everyone must do it. Intellectuals, including all state cadres, should participate in this movement and attach importance to this labor. We know that intellectuals generally do not pay much attention to this kind of labor. They think that it is not worth it to catch a fly or a mouse themselves. It seems unnecessary to move the bed and scrub the floor themselves. In this way, the labor practice in everyone's daily life, and a very important labor practice, is ignored. How can we strengthen the labor viewpoint?
    In the anti-four pests and hygiene campaign, everyone who wants to cultivate and strengthen their labor viewpoint can start with eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene, and engage in labor practice. Of course, this is not the only way, nor is it the main way. However, combining the anti-four pests and hygiene campaign with strengthening cadres' labor training is undoubtedly beneficial and possible.
    Actively participating in the anti-four pests and hygiene campaign can also train our mass viewpoint and collectivist spirit. Our country is a great collective. In this great collective, everyone must fight for a common goal. Eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene is the requirement of the broad masses and one of the action slogans of the broad masses. Let each of us participate in this magnificent battle to conquer nature. Four-without villages, four-without towns, four-without streets, four-without organs, four-without schools... Ten thousand facts will show us the unparalleled greatness of the masses' strength and the priceless value of collectivism!

    卫生运动中的劳动锻炼
    应天长
    劳动锻炼对于每一个人来说都是必需的，对于知识分子，从事脑力劳动的国家机关干部来说更是当前改造自己的主要途径。
    劳动锻炼是多方面的，有农业劳动，有工业劳动，有自我服务的劳动，等等。知识分子在各种体力劳动中，都可以受到锻炼。当然，最主要的劳动锻炼是参加工业、农业生产，特别是农业生产。目前，大批知识分子，大批国家机关干部到了工厂、农村，满怀信心地要在劳动中把自己改造成为工人阶级知识分子。
    也还有很大一部分知识分子、国家机关干部现在还没有直接参加工业、农业生产中的劳动锻炼。
    是不是他们就无从锻炼起呢？不是的。至少从目前开展的轰轰烈烈的除四害、讲卫生运动来说，他们在这中间是可以受到劳动锻炼的。
    除四害、讲卫生运动，是一个全民性的广泛的集体的运动，也是一个带有自我服务性的劳动。因为，要能真正除掉四害，讲求卫生，那非大家动手不可，一个人是干不了的。但是严格说起来，除四害、讲卫生，又是每一个人自己的事情，关系到每一个人自身的安危。所以，每一个人又非干不可。知识分子，包括一切国家机关干部，应当参加这个运动，重视这种劳动。我们知道，一般知识分子是不大重视这种劳动的。他们认为，打个苍蝇，捉个老鼠，也要自己动手，实在犯不着。搬动床铺，洗擦地板，也要自己动手，似乎无此必要。这样一来，在每个人的日常生活中的劳动实践，而且是非常重要的劳动实践都被忽略了。要加强劳动观点，如何能加强得起来呢？
    在除四害讲卫生运动中，每一个人要想培养和加强自己的劳动观点，就可以从除四害、讲卫生着眼，从事劳动实践。自然，这样做并不是唯一的，也不是主要的。但是，把除四害、讲卫生运动同加强干部的劳动锻炼相结合，无疑是有益的，而且是可能的。
    积极参加除四害、讲卫生运动，也可以锻炼我们的群众观点和集体主义精神。我们的国家是一个伟大的集体。在这个伟大的集体里，每一个人都要为共同的目标战斗。除四害、讲卫生是广大群众的要求，也是广大群众的行动口号之一。让我们每一个人都参加到这场宏伟的征服自然的战斗中，四无村、四无镇、四无街道、四无机关、四无学校……万千事实会向我们表明，群众力量的伟大无比和集体主义的珍贵无比！
