Soviet Oil Industry Workers Set Output Increase Methods to Raise Annual Oil Production to 400 Million Tons
Will Massively Develop New Oil Fields in the East; Use Advanced Technology and Equipment to Process Industry

Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, January 22nd – Workers in the Soviet oil industry are striving to reach an annual oil production of 350 million to 400 million tons in the next fifteen years. To complete this task, which is of great significance to the further development of the national economy, the Soviet oil industry is vigorously developing new oil fields with abundant reserves in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union and actively applying advanced technologies in oil production.

In 1957, Soviet oil production achieved great success. The annual production plan was overfulfilled ahead of schedule, producing more than 14 million tons of oil than in 1956. The main reason for the significant increase in Soviet oil production in recent years is the successive exploitation of new oil fields in the eastern regions. For example, the exploitation of new oil fields in Lomaszkin in the Tatar Autonomous Republic, Skapov in the Bashkir Autonomous Republic, and Mukhanovsky in the Kuibyshev Oblast annually increased the country's crude oil production by nearly 40 million tons.

This year's oil production plan has also been significantly increased. The annual plan is to increase oil production by 13.7% compared to last year. Of this, 75% of the oil will be obtained in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union. Thousands of new drilling rigs and pumping units will be installed this year.

Old oil field areas such as Baku will also be further developed. There, more low-cost, high-quality crude oil will be produced. New oil fields discovered in the central regions such as Stalingrad, Permsk, and Saratov this year will also produce tens of thousands of tons of oil.

Highly efficient oil processing plants and oil pipelines equipped with advanced technology have been built in the eastern regions. The massive oil processing projects in Omsk, Gorky, and Kuibyshev must be completed this year. (The left picture shows technicians inspecting a turbine drill.)

    十五年内把石油年产量提高到四亿吨
    苏联石油工业职工定出增产办法
    将大量开发东部新油田　用先进技术装备加工业
    本报莫斯科22日电　苏联石油工业部门的职工们正在努力争取在最近十五年内达到每年生产石油三亿五千万到四亿吨。为了完成这个对进一步发展国民经济具有重大意义的任务，苏联石油工业部门正在大力开发苏联东部地区蕴藏丰富的新油田，并在石油生产中积极运用先进技术。
    1957年苏联石油生产获得了很大成就。全年生产计划提前超额完成，即比1956年多生产了一千四百多万吨石油。近年来苏联石油生产显著提高的主要原因是由于东部地区新油田的相继开采。如最近在鞑靼自治共和国的洛马斯金、巴什基里亚自治共和国的斯卡波夫和古比雪夫州的姆哈诺夫斯基三地的新油田开采，每年给国家增产了将近四千万吨原油。
    今年的石油生产计划任务又有了显著提高。全年计划比去年增产石油13.7％。其中75％的石油将在苏联东部地区取得。成千架的新的钻孔机和吸油机将在今年安装起来。
    巴库等地的老油田区也将进一步开发。那里将更多地生产成本较低、质量优良的原油。中部地区新发现的斯大林格勒、彼尔姆斯克、萨拉托夫等地区新油田今年亦将生产成万吨的石油。
    运用先进技术装备起来的生产效率强大的石油加工工厂和输油管已在东部地区兴建。今年必须竣工的有鄂木斯克、高尔基、古比雪夫等巨大石油加工工程。（左图是技工在检查涡轮钻机）
