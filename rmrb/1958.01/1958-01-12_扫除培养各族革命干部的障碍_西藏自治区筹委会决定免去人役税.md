Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 11th: The Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region has decided to exempt people of all ethnic groups in Tibet who work in state organs (including service personnel), students (including university, middle, and primary school students) from the corvée tax they bear to local authorities or headmen. The Tibet Daily, the organ of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, published on January 8th the resolution on this issue passed by the 23rd meeting of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region.

The resolution stipulates: "1. From now on, the local governments, the Panchen Kampot Conference Hall Committee, and the People's Liberation Committee of the Qamdo area, under the jurisdiction of the various dzong, xi, and responsible headmen, shall not continue to apportion various corvée taxes to people of all ethnic groups in Tibet who work in state organs, students, or the students themselves; 2. After the corvée tax borne by the personnel referred to in Article 1 is exempted, it shall not be transferred to their families for support; 3. All sectors of society should actively support and assist staff or cadres, students, and students who have participated or will participate in work or study, and no direct or indirect persecution is allowed.

The resolution said: "To build a prosperous and happy new Tibet, based on the construction experience of other regions of the motherland, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of local ethnic cadres. In the past, the Standing Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee successively passed various resolutions on cultivating cadres, and various organs and people from all walks of life actively and responsibly recruited a large number of Tibetan, Hui, and other ethnic personnel to participate in work or study. They are the important backbone of Tibet's various construction tasks in the future. However, some people do not understand the important significance of the above-mentioned work and continue to apportion various corvée taxes (including poll tax) to some cadres and students."

The resolution also condemned the serious illegal crime of Ben Gen Que Zhu, a headman in the Gyantse area of Tibet, for beating Wangjie Pingcuo, a Tibetan student, on the pretext that Wangjie Pingcuo had not paid the corvée tax that he had over-allocated.

This resolution was unanimously adopted at the Standing Committee meeting held on December 30, 1957. Before the resolution was passed, the Dalai Lama, who presided over the meeting, explained the draft resolution. He said that after the incident of Ben Gen Que Zhu beating Wangjie Pingcuo, cadres and students from Lhasa and other regions rose up to condemn and oppose the incident, demanding that the criminals be severely punished. The Preparatory Committee also believes that this issue is very important. Although the Gyangtse Jicho-level office has dealt with it, in order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, in addition to giving the criminal the criminal punishment he deserves, it is necessary to make another resolution to protect the physical and mental safety of cadres and students so that they can work and study with peace of mind.

The Tibet Daily published on January 8th the "Decision of the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee on Severely Punishing the Case of Ben Gen Que Zhu Beating Student Wangjie Pingcuo" and the investigation report of the "Investigation Team on the Incident of Ben Gen Que Zhu Beating Student Wangjie Pingcuo."

The Tibet Daily also published a commentary entitled "A Major Victory in the Patriotic, United, and Progressive Cause!" to welcome the above-mentioned resolutions and decisions. The commentary said: This is a powerful measure to support anti-imperialist patriotism, unity, and progress, and to oppose division, reaction, and regression activities. This will have a significant and far-reaching impact on the gradual growth of revolutionary cadres of all ethnic groups in Tibet in the future. This resolution and decision are completely in line with the interests of the Tibetan people.

The commentary said: So far, with the increase in the anti-imperialist patriotic consciousness of the Tibetan people, the work of cultivating ethnic cadres has reached a considerable scale, and the achievements are enormous. The commentary pointed out that there are indeed a small number of people in Tibet who have ulterior motives and hate the patriotic, united, and progressive cause of Tibet, so they also hate and oppose the revolutionary cadres who serve the patriotic, united, and progressive cause of Tibet. The commentary said that the incident of Ben Gen Que Zhu, the headman of Gyantse, beating the student Wangjie Pingcuo, is just one of the more typical examples. The commentary hopes that in the publicity, education, and organization of the study of the resolutions and decisions, the power of the vast number of cadres, students, the masses of the people, and the public will be transformed into a great force for supervising the thorough implementation of the resolutions and decisions.

    扫除培养各族革命干部的障碍
    西藏自治区筹委会决定免去人役税
    新华社拉萨11日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会决定免去西藏各族人民参加国家机关工作的人员（包括勤杂人员）、学员（包括大、中、小学学生）向地方或头人等担负的人役税。自治区筹委会机关报——西藏日报1月8日公布了自治区筹委会常务委员会第二十三次会议就这一问题通过的决议。
    决议规定：“一、今后西藏地区的地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会和昌都地区人民解放委员会所属的各宗、溪和各主管头人，不得对西藏各族人民参加国家机关工作的人员、学员、学生本人继续摊派各种人役；二、凡第一条所指的人员本人所担负的人役免去后，不得转而摊派给他们的家属支应；三、对现已参加或今后参加工作的工作人员或学习的干部、学员、学生，各界人士都应该积极予以支持和协助，决不允许直接或间接地加以迫害。
    决议说：“要建设繁荣幸福的新西藏，根据祖国其他地区的建设经验，必须培养大量的本地区民族干部。过去西藏自治区筹备委员会常务委员会先后通过了关于培养干部的各项决议，各机关和各界人士，曾积极负责地吸收了大批藏、回等族人员参加工作或学习。他们是今后西藏各项建设工作的重要骨干。但是，却有一些人不明了上述工作的重要意义，对一些干部和学员继续摊派各种人役（包括人头税）。”
    决议还谴责了西藏江孜地区头人本根却珠借口藏族学员旺杰平措未支应他所超额摊派的人役而毒打旺杰平措的严重违法罪行。
    这项决议是在1957年12月30日召开的常务委员会上一致通过的。决议通过前，主持会议的达赖喇嘛就决议草案作了说明。他说，本根却珠毒打旺杰平措事件发生后，拉萨及其他各地区的机关干部和学员都纷纷起来声讨、反对，要求严惩罪犯。筹委会也认为这个问题很重要，虽然江孜基巧级办事处已作了处理，为了防止以后发生类似事件，除给该犯判处应得的刑事处分外，有必要再作一个保护干部、学员身心安全的决议，使他们能够安心工作学习。
    西藏日报1月8日公布了西藏自治区筹备委员会“关于重判本根却珠毒打学员旺杰平措案件的决定”和“本根却珠毒打学员旺杰平措事件”调查组的调查报告。
    西藏日报还以“爱国、团结、进步事业中的一个重大胜利！”为题发表评论，对上述决议和决定表示欢迎。评论说：这是支持反帝爱国、团结、进步，反对分裂、反动、倒退活动的有力措施。这对今后西藏各族的革命干部的逐步成长，具有重大而深远的影响。这一决议和决定，是完全符合西藏人民的利益的。
    评论说：到目前为止，随着西藏人民反帝爱国觉悟的增涨，民族干部的培养工作已具有一个相当的规模，成绩是巨大的。评论指出：西藏确实还存在一小撮居心叵测的分子，他们仇恨西藏的爱国、团结、进步事业，所以他们也仇恨和反对为西藏爱国、团结、进步事业服务的革命干部。评论说，江孜头人本根却珠毒打学员旺杰平措一事，只不过是其中一个比较典型的例证。评论希望各地在宣传、教育和组织对决议、决定的学习中，把广大干部、学员、人民群众和公众的力量，变成监督决议、决定彻底实现的伟大力量。
