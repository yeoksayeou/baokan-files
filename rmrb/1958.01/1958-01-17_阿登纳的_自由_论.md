Notes

    Adenauer openly rejected the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. He uttered a clever argument: the emergence of this zone "would mean the end of freedom for Western Europe and the end of our own freedom."

    There is a certain amount of truth in this statement. The establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe would indeed mean that some European countries, including West Germany, would no longer have the freedom to become atomic war bases and atomic war targets at the same time. The warmongers of the Adenauer type would also be restricted in their freedom to launch an atomic war.

    However, the vast public in Western Europe are happy to give up this kind of freedom. They are also actively demanding that everyone give up the freedom to test and use nuclear weapons, and the freedom to engage in the arms race.

### 阿登纳的“自由”论

    阿登纳的“自由”论
    阿登纳公开拒绝关于在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议。他发表妙论说：这个地带的产生“将意味着西欧自由的终结以及我们自己的自由的终结”。
    这种说法也不无一定的道理。在中欧建立起无原子武器区，欧洲的一部分国家，包括西德在内，就的确将不再有变成为原子战争基地同时也是原子战争靶子的自由了。阿登纳之流的好战分子也就被限制了他们发动原子战争的自由了。
    但是，西欧广大公众是乐于舍弃这种自由的。他们还积极要求大家一块放弃试验和使用核武器的自由，放弃进行军备竞赛的自由。
