Where Lies the Key to Ensuring Quality?
    Tian Xiying

The work of water conservancy construction is becoming increasingly intense. Many regions have launched competitions, and no one wants to fall behind, so they are stepping up their efforts. At the same time, other winter tasks in rural areas, such as eliminating the four pests, accumulating fertilizer, afforestation, and preparing for spring plowing, also need to be intensified. Under these circumstances, it is very important to pay attention to the quality of water conservancy projects.

This year, the construction of water conservancy projects has implemented the principle of focusing on small and medium-sized projects and relying mainly on agricultural cooperatives. The masses are very concerned about the progress and benefits of the work. Therefore, the vast majority of projects are being done quickly, well, and economically. The most important reason for failing to fully implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results is the failure to fully rely on the masses.

Judging from the situation in some areas, the key to ensuring project quality lies in relying on the masses in many ways:

First, problems must be handed over to the masses for discussion so that they understand the close relationship between the quality of the project and their own interests. Let the masses come up with ideas and methods, and, at the appropriate time, launch major debates on the construction site, relying on the majority of the masses to overcome the phenomena of disregard for collective interests, lax labor discipline, and disregard for project quality that exist among a few people.

Second, fully utilize the technical forces among the masses and strive to pass the technology on to the masses. This year's water conservancy projects are large in number and wide in scope, and are mainly undertaken by the masses. Therefore, if some technical problems in water conservancy projects are not addressed in a timely manner, the quality of the projects will be affected. Lvhua Cooperative in Changan Township, Jiaocheng County, Shanxi Province, dug a canal that should have passed through high ground, but because they did not understand the technology, they dug it in the middle of the ground, which cost more labor, occupied more land, and would irrigate less land. The cadres of Jiaocheng County overcame this difficulty by relying on the masses. They gathered a group of "native experts" with water conservancy construction experience from various agricultural cooperatives and asked them to go to various places to inspect, help impart technology, and solve difficult problems, which was deeply welcomed by the masses. Laibin County, Guangxi, used the spare time from water conservancy construction to train more than 400 technicians and construction workers on the construction site, which also played a significant role in the local water conservancy work. These examples all show that relying on the masses can solve the technical problems of building small-scale water conservancy projects.

Third, promptly summarize and promote the advanced experiences created by the masses. Many regions have seen improvements in water conservancy tools, construction site facilities, and labor management. This is an extremely valuable wealth created by the masses in their production practice. The Yishan Prefectural Committee promptly collected the creations of the masses and synthesized them into "Fourteen Reforms for Water Conservancy Construction Sites," which were promoted throughout the entire area, so that various tools and labor organizations on water conservancy construction sites in various places could be improved. Doing so greatly improved project efficiency and ensured project quality. The practice of systematically collecting and disseminating the scattered experiences created by the masses in a timely manner is worthy of great promotion.

This year, various localities have universally promoted the contract system and the dedicated responsibility system in water conservancy work, assigning specific personnel to be responsible for inspecting and appraising projects. These are of course necessary and helpful in ensuring project quality. However, the work of ensuring quality must not be limited to post-mortem inspection. What is more important is to fully mobilize the masses to think of ways to check the quality of the project at any time and any place and improve the quality of the project throughout the entire work process.

    保证质量的关键何在
    田喜盈
    兴修水利的工作越来越紧张了。不少地区开展了评比竞赛，谁也不甘落后，正在加劲往前赶。而农村里其他冬季工作，如除四害、积肥、造林、准备春耕等等，也都要在这个时候加紧进行。在这种情况下，对于水利工程的质量很需要加以注意。
    今年兴修水利贯彻了中小型为主、农业社自办为主的方针，群众对工作进度和效益都很关心。因此，绝大部分工程都做得又快又好又省。凡是不能全面贯彻执行多快好省的方针的，最重要的原因就是没有充分地依靠群众。
    从一些地区的情况看来，保证工程质量的关键就在于从多方面依靠群众：
    第一，要把问题交给群众讨论，使群众了解工程质量的好坏同群众的切身利益的密切关系，让群众出主意、想办法；并且在适当时机在工地上开展大辩论，依靠群众的多数，克服在一部分人当中存在的不顾集体利益、劳动纪律松弛、漠视工程质量的现象。
    第二，充分运用群众中的技术力量，并且力求把技术交给群众。今年的水利工程数量很大，范围很广，主要由群众兴办，因此，对一些水利工程上的技术问题，如果不及时给以帮助，也会使工程质量受到影响。山西交城县常安乡绿花社开了一道水渠，渠道本来应该由地的高处走过，但他们不懂技术，把它开在地当中，多费了工，多占了地，还要少浇地。交城县的干部依靠群众克服了这个困难。他们从各个农业社中调集了一批有水利建设经验的“土专家”，请他们到各地去，一面检查，一面帮助传授技术、解决疑难问题，深得群众欢迎。广西来宾县利用修水利的工余时间，在工地上训练出来四百多名技术员和施工员，对当地的水利工作也起了不小的作用。这些事例都说明了，依靠群众是可以解决兴修小型水利的技术问题的。
    第三，及时总结和推广群众创造的先进经验。许多地区都出现了改进水利工具、改进工地设施、改进劳动管理等方面的经验。这是群众在生产实践中创造出来的极可贵的财富。宜山地委及时把群众的创造集中起来，综合为“水利工地十四项改革”，在全专区加以推广，使各地水利工地上的各项工具和劳动组织都能得到改进。这样做，就大大提高了工程效率，同时也保证了工程质量。及时地把群众创造的零星的经验比较系统地集中起来，传播开去，这种做法是值得大大提倡的。
    今年，各地在水利工作当中普遍推广了包干制、专责制，指定专人负责对工程作检查鉴定，这些当然是必要的，对保证工程质量是有帮助的。但是，决不能把保证质量的工作限于事后检查上面。更重要的是在全部工作过程中充分地发动群众多想办法，随时随地检查工程质量，提高工程质量。
