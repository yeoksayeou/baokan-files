    This article reports: The National Geological Data Bureau of the Ministry of Geology convened the Fifth National Geological Data Work Conference from December 17th to 21st, 1957, and decided to resolutely implement the unified geological work registration system and the unified geological data submission system.

    Currently, geological work in China is being carried out simultaneously by several industrial departments, and the phenomenon of duplication and parallelism is very serious. This not only wastes the country's limited financial and human resources, but also creates contradictions between each other, hindering the normal development of geological work.

    The conference believes that the National Geological Data Bureau must resolutely undertake the task assigned by the State Council to register and count the geological work carried out annually by relevant departments across the country. All units engaged in geological work must register with the geological data office of the provincial and autonomous region geological bureaus in the work area before planning and sending out teams.

    The conference believes that with the implementation of the national unified geological work registration system, favorable conditions will be created for the implementation of the unified geological data submission system. All units engaged in geological work must submit work reports to the local geological bureau's geological data office on time, in order to provide for geological work and scientific research.

    事前登记  事后报告
    本报讯　地质部全国地质资料局于1957年12月17日至21日召开了第五届全国地质资料工作会议，决定坚决贯彻地质工作统一登记制度和地质资料统一汇交制度。
    目前我国的地质工作是由几个工业部门同时进行的，重复并行的现象非常严重，不但浪费了国家有限的财力人力，也造成了彼此之间的矛盾，妨碍了地质工作的正常发展。
    会议认为，全国地质资料局必须坚决担负起国务院所规定的对全国各有关部门每年所进行的地质工作进行登记和统计的任务。所有一切做地质工作的单位，必须在计划后出队前到工作所在地区的省、自治区地质局地质资料处进行登记。
    会议认为，随着全国地质工作统一登记制度的贯彻，将为地质资料的统一汇交制度的贯彻创造有利的条件。一切做地质工作的单位都必须按时向当地地质局地质资料处汇交工作报告，以便提供地质工作和科学研究工作使用。
