Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 22nd: Six thousand leading members of Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles concluded their three-month-plus rectification study with a half-day of agricultural labor in the suburbs on the 20th.

These six thousand industrialists and businessmen attended the last report meeting of the study period on the 19th. Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the meeting that after more than three months of rectification study, the ideological understanding of industrialists and businessmen has been improved to varying degrees, their political stance has been changed to varying degrees, and the political attitude of many people has begun to shift to the left. He encouraged the industrialists and businessmen present to return to their work posts and, on the basis of this rectification study, continue to transform themselves, contribute well to their enterprises, and keep up with the new situation of the country's rapid development.

These six thousand key members were concentrated in the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Political School from late September last year to carry out rectification studies. They first theoretically discussed the question of whether the capitalist stance was reactionary, and initially established the determination to change their stance and devote themselves to rectification. Then, in light of reality, they used various methods to criticize and help the erroneous words, deeds, and ideological styles of their colleagues, co-workers, and old friends. They posted more than 100,000 dazibao (big-character posters), exposing the varying degrees of erroneous ideas that many industrialists and businessmen had on fundamental issues such as accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class. Each study class and group debated the major issues of right and wrong revealed by the dazibao, and on this basis, launched a struggle against rightists, successively exposing more than 260 bourgeois rightists. In mid-December, the rectification study shifted to the general rectification stage, where everyone conducted self-examination, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and formulated personal rectification plans targeting their main shortcomings in political thought as goals for further self-transformation in the future. Before the end of the study, these six thousand industrialists and businessmen once again engaged in big contending and big blooming, putting forward criticisms and suggestions to relevant government leadership departments, public representatives, and organizations such as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association, to help them with rectification.

After more than three months of intensive rectification, these industrialists and businessmen generally felt that they had received an extremely profound and vivid education on some fundamental issues. Many people originally thought that after handing over the means of production, there was not much difference between bourgeois elements and the working class, and there was no need for further transformation. After self-examination and mutual assistance, and in the face of a large number of exposed facts, they began to deny this view, arousing the desire to transform themselves. In thousands of debates on major issues of right and wrong and in the struggle to reason with rightists, they saw the superiority of the socialist system. Many small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen talked about the benefits brought to them by the joint state-private ownership of enterprises. Recalling the days of precariousness and uncertainty in the past, they even burst into tears, deeply feeling how absurd the idea of "joint operation is not as good as individual operation" was in the past. They had a particularly profound understanding of the issue of accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class, and began to have a new understanding of the system of public representatives. Zhang Yingcai, deputy director of Yongxiuzhai Plastics Factory, used to feel that he "had the title but no power." Now he realizes that the "power" he pursued was the "power" of arbitrary decision-making like in the private sector, which is essentially a lack of conviction in the leadership of the Communist Party. He said that after returning to the factory, he would take accepting the leadership of the public representative as a concrete action to transform himself.

### 上海工商界骨干分子结束整风学习  在一些根本性问题上受到深刻教育

    上海工商界骨干分子结束整风学习
    在一些根本性问题上受到深刻教育
    据新华社上海22日电　上海市工商界六千名骨干分子20日到郊区进行了半天农业劳动，结束了他们三个多月的整风学习。
    这六千名工商业者19日参加了学习期内的最后一次报告会。中共上海市委书记曹荻秋在会上说，经过这三个多月的整风学习，工商业者的思想认识有了不同程度提高，政治立场有了不同程度改变，很多人的政治态度开始向左转化。他勉励到会的工商业者回到工作岗位以后，要在这次整风学习的基础上，继续不断地改造自己，在企业中很好地贡献力量，使自己跟上国家飞跃发展的新形势。
    这六千名骨干分子是去年9月下旬起集中在上海市工商界政治学校进行整风学习的。他们首先从理论上讨论了资本主义立场是不是反动的问题，初步树立了改变立场、投入整风的决心，接着联系实际，运用各种方式对自己的同业、同事与老朋友的错误言行和思想作风展开批评和帮助。他们贴出的大字报就有十万多张，暴露出许多工商业者在接受共产党和工人阶级领导等根本性问题上，存在着不同程度的错误观念。各学习班、组就大字报揭露出来的大是大非问题进行了争辩，并在这个基础上展开反右派斗争，先后揭发出二百六十多个资产阶级右派分子。12月中旬，整风学习转入一般整风阶段，人人进行自我检查，开展了批评和自我批评，并且针对自己政治思想上的主要缺点，订出个人整改规划，作为今后进一步自我改造的目标。学习结束前，这六千个工商业者又大鸣大放，向有关的政府领导部门、公方代表以及工商联、民主建国会等组织提出批评和建议，帮助他们整风。
    这些工商业者经过三个多月的集中整风，普遍感到在一些根本性质问题上受到了一次极为深刻、生动的教育。许多人原来以为交出生产资料之后，资产阶级分子与工人阶级没有多大差别，用不着再改造；经过自我检查和互相帮助，在暴露出来的大量事实面前，他们开始否定这种见解，引起改造自己的要求。在千百次大是大非问题的辩论和同右派分子的说理斗争中，他们看到社会主义制度的优越性。许多中小工商业者谈到企业公私合营后给他们带来的好处，回想到过去风雨飘摇、朝不保夕的日子时，甚至痛哭失声，深感过去“合营不如单干”的想法是多么荒唐。在接受共产党和工人阶级领导问题上，他们体会得特别深刻，对公方代表制度开始有了新的认识。永秀斋塑胶厂副厂长张英才，过去总感到自己“有职无权”，现在认识到他所追求的“权”是像私营时期那样独断专行的“权”，这实质上是对共产党的领导不心服。他表示回厂以后要把接受公方代表领导作为改造自己的一项具体行动。
