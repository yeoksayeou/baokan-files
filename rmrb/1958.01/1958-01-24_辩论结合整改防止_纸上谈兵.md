Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Special Dispatch: The CPC Chen County Committee of Hunan Province recently inspected the rural rectification work in Chen County area, pointing out that a scholastic method of rectification and debate was quite common in the movement, which affected both rectification and production, and demanded that all counties take swift measures to resolutely correct this shortcoming.

The second batch of agricultural cooperatives in Chen County area started their rectification movement in early winter last year, but when it turned to the rectification and debate stage, there was a general state of low enthusiasm or stagnation. Specifically, some cooperatives did not proceed from the actual ideological situation of the local masses, and instead of conducting rational debate targeting specific people and events, they put forward some empty arguments or topics for the masses to debate, which neither improved the masses' awareness nor solved practical problems, thus failing to promote production. Some cooperatives mechanically applied the work steps, failing to seize the most pressing problems of the moment for debate and rectification. For example, some Party and League members holding positions in the cooperatives had serious capitalist and individualistic thoughts, even violating laws and regulations, and the cooperative members had many opinions about this, which seriously hindered the current production. However, the work team cadres emphasized that Party and League rectification was the fourth step, and did not immediately lead the rectification, causing everyone to feel depressed. In addition, some cooperatives lacked unified leadership over production and rectification, and there were contradictions in terms of time and effort.

The CPC Chen County Committee analyzed the reasons for these phenomena, mainly because the cadres were unclear about the relationship between production and rectification, and some were divorced from reality, leading the rectification movement with dogmatic methods; others only grasped production and neglected rectification. At the same time, some cadres (including cooperative cadres) had right-leaning thoughts, fearing to offend people and fearing that they could not control the situation.

Therefore, the County Committee demanded that all counties resolutely correct this scholastic method of debate, and according to the different situations in the current production and the masses' thoughts in each cooperative, seize the prominent problems for criticism, debate and rectification, and under the principle of closely focusing on deeply criticizing capitalist and individualistic thoughts, do what you do, debate what you debate, educate the masses to distinguish right from wrong, and truly achieve both production and rectification without delay. Secondly, counties, townships, and cooperatives should establish unified leadership organizations for production and rectification, make comprehensive arrangements for work, and promote each other. Finally, the County Committee also specifically pointed out that at present, some cooperative members are using various excuses to only care about managing their private plots and other individual sideline production, and are not obeying the unified allocation of the cooperative, which is a serious problem. This problem should be resolved through criticism and debate in the rectification movement.

    辩论结合整改防止“纸上谈兵”
    中共郴县地委纠正农村整风中脱离实际的偏向
    本报特约新华社长沙讯　中共湖南省郴县地委最近检查了郴县地区的农村整风工作，指出在运动中比较普遍地存在着学究式的整改辩论方法，使整风和生产都受到影响，要求各县迅速采取措施坚决纠正这个缺点。
    郴县地区第二批农业社的整风运动是在去年冬初开始的，但是当转入整改辩论阶段，就普遍出现了劲头不大或停滞不前的状态。具体表现在：一部分社不从当地群众的思想实际出发，针对具体的人和事进行说理辩论，而是空洞地提出一些论点或题目让群众辩论，既不能提高群众觉悟，也不能解决实际问题，推动生产。一部分社机械地套用工作步骤，没有抓住当前最迫切的问题进行辩论、整改。如有些担任社干的党、团员存在严重的资本主义和个人主义思想，甚至违法乱纪，社员意见很多，严重地妨碍着当前生产的开展，但工作组干部强调整党、整团是第四步，不立即领导进行整顿，使大家情绪低落。还有一部分社对生产、整风缺乏统一领导，时间上和力量上互相矛盾。
    中共郴县地委分析产生这些现象的原因，主要是干部对生产与整风的关系认识不清，有的脱离实际，以教条主义的方法领导整风运动；有的只抓生产，丢了整风。同时，部分干部（包括社干部）存在右倾思想，怕得罪人，怕不好掌握。
    因此，地委要求各县坚决纠正这种学究式的辩论方法，根据各个社当前生产中和群众思想中的不同情况，抓住突出问题，进行鸣放、辩论和整改，并且要在紧紧围绕着深入批判资本主义、个人主义思想的原则下，作到做什么就辩什么，教育群众分清大是大非，真正做到生产、整风两不误。其次，县、乡、社成立统一领导生产整风的机构，全面安排工作，互相推动。最后，地委还特别指出，目前部分社员以种种借口只顾经营自留地和其他个人副业生产，不服从社的统一调配，是个严重问题。这个问题要在整风中通过鸣放辩论加以解决。
