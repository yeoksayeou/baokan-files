Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th – The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army recently convened a military-wide friendship work conference, deciding to continue strengthening internationalist education throughout the entire army and further enhance the friendship and unity between the Volunteer Army and the Korean people and army.

The friendship work conference summarized the friendship work between the Volunteer Army and the Korean people and army in 1957 and studied and arranged the friendship work tasks for 1958. The conference believed that the friendly unity between the Volunteer Army and the Korean people has been increasingly consolidated and developed in recent years. In 1957 alone, the Volunteer Army dispatched 637,900 man-days to support the Korean people's production and construction. They not only helped the Korean people build 520 dikes and canals with a total length of 213 kilometers but also made great achievements in helping the Korean people build bridges and houses, carry out agricultural production, plant trees and forests, provide disaster relief, and prevent and cure diseases. At the same time, the Korean people also gave the Volunteer Army meticulous care and support in all aspects. In 1957, the Korean people supported the Volunteer Army with 3,500 tons of grain straw, 2,895 tons of charcoal, 30,000 cubic meters of construction timber, 4.5 million red bricks, and many other kinds of materials and equipment. Over the past year, friendly exchanges between the Volunteer Army and the Korean people, such as mutual visits, discussions, get-togethers, performances, condolences, gifts, and congratulations, have also been extremely frequent. In 1957, both sides sent delegations for visits and condolences to celebrate festivals on six or seven hundred occasions each.

In order to continue to enhance the friendly unity between the Volunteer Army and the Korean people, the conference particularly emphasized the need to conduct internationalist education regularly throughout the army. The conference requested the entire army to use the spirit of rectification to vigorously conduct a widespread and in-depth internationalist education campaign during the China-Korea Friendship Month in February.
