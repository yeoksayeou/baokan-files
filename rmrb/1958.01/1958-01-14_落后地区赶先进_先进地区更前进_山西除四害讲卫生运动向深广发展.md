Backward Areas Catch Up with Advanced Areas; Advanced Areas Advance Further
Shanxi's Eliminate Four Pests and Promote Hygiene Campaign Develops Deeply and Broadly

(Our report) The eliminate four pests and promote hygiene campaign in Shanxi Province is developing extensively and deeply.

The characteristics of the hygiene movement in the province at this stage are: strong momentum, high confidence, and large scale. Party and government leaders in many areas are guiding this work with the vigor of socialist revolution. Most counties have formulated plans. Jiaocheng, Fenyang, Qi County, Pian Guan, Hequ, Hong Zhao, Lin County, Xin County, Daren, Zuoyun, Changzhi and other cities and counties, in accordance with the instructions of the provincial Party committee, are actively cultivating model villages in order to break through at one point in their respective areas and promote overall progress. In the past, Dingxiang County only had nine model hygiene villages and no "four-without" villages (villages without rats, sparrows, flies and mosquitoes). Since the beginning of winter, the county's Party Congress has particularly emphasized the elimination of the four pests, followed by the cultivation of typical examples and the organization of visits. According to statistics at the end of last year, 43 villages in the county had basically eliminated rats and sparrows. More and more new "four-without" villages have emerged in various places. These facts have further inspired people's enthusiasm, enabling 80% of the counties and cities in the province to widely carry out the campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. According to incomplete statistics from thirty-four counties and cities in the province at the end of last year, more than 953,600 sparrows and 567,400 rats had been eliminated and more than 451,800 large carts of fertilizer had been accumulated in two months. If we calculate that each sparrow consumes three catties of grain per year, eliminating these sparrows is equivalent to reducing the loss of 2.8 million catties of grain. If we calculate that each rat consumes 18 catties of grain per year, eliminating these rats is equivalent to reducing the loss of more than 10 million catties of grain. According to comrades from Jishan County, each large cart of fertilizer can increase grain production by eight catties, so the above-mentioned amount of fertilizer can increase grain production by more than 3.61 million catties.

In order to develop the province's winter patriotic health movement and the great leap forward in agricultural production in a coordinated manner, and to further promote the great leap forward in agricultural production, Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City jointly held a broadcast conference on eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene at the end of last year. Nearly one million cadres and people across the province listened directly to the live broadcast of the conference. At the broadcast conference, three advanced counties in hygiene work, Jishan, Tunliu, and Dingxiang, put forward a proposal to all counties in the province to achieve "four-without" counties as soon as possible and strive to achieve "four-without" provinces in seven years. This conference marked the beginning of a great leap forward in the province's winter patriotic health movement. Some areas where the movement was not well underway are trying to catch up with the advanced; the advanced areas have put forward higher demands. According to statistics at the end of last year, the hygiene movement in 20% of the counties and cities in the province had not been well initiated. Among them, Yongji County has shown great improvement at the beginning of this year. The county committee of the Communist Party of China in the county made a resolution on the elimination of the four pests at a cadre meeting, and on January 4th sent more than 100 grassroots cadres to Jishan County to study. After listening to the introduction of the leaders of Jishan County, they were full of confidence and expressed that they would change their original plan to cultivate two "four-without" townships and twenty "four-without" villages this year to more than two hundred "four-without" villages. Jishan County is an advanced area. The county has 169 model hygiene villages, including 61 villages that are basically free of rats and sparrows, and four villages that are basically free of the four pests. However, the county has proposed the goal of basically achieving a "four-without" county this year. In order to achieve this goal, the county committee of the Communist Party of China in the county is stepping up supervision and inspection.

There are two major ideological obstacles to the campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene in Shanxi Province: one comes from advanced areas, where a relaxed mood has begun to emerge among some villages that have basically eliminated rats and sparrows. Some people say: "Almost all the sparrows have been killed. The dozen or so that are left are slippery and cunning. They fly away when they see people. How can you kill them?" According to the experience of Jishan County, it is necessary to repeatedly explain to cadres and the masses that if some sparrows are left unkilled, they will reproduce in the spring, and all previous efforts will be in vain. At the same time, it is necessary to put forward higher demands in a timely manner and point out specific measures such as finding loopholes. As a result, people's enthusiasm will become greater and greater. Another ideological obstacle comes from backward areas. The hygiene movement has not been very successful in 20% of the counties and cities in the province. The main reason is that the leading cadres in the counties are afraid that eliminating the four pests will hinder production. This shows that some comrades among the leading cadres do not understand that eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene not only does not delay production, but also greatly promotes production. Some comrades in Yongji County were able to boldly revise their original plan after visiting Jishan because they dispelled their concerns that hygiene work would delay production.

    落后地区赶先进　先进地区更前进
    山西除四害讲卫生运动向深广发展
    本报讯　山西省除四害、讲卫生运动正广泛深入地开展。
    该省卫生运动在目前阶段的特点是：劲头足，信心高，规模大。许多地区的党政领导同志都以社会主义革命干劲指导这一工作。大多数县已订出计划，交城、汾阳、祁县、偏关、河曲、洪赵、临县、忻县、大仁、左云、长治等县市根据省委的指示，都在积极地培养典型乡村，以便在本地区突破一点，推动全面。定襄县原来只有九个模范卫生村，没有四无村。入冬以来，该县党代表大会上特别强调了除四害，接着进行培养典型和组织参观。到去年年底统计，全县便有四十三个村基本上消灭了鼠雀。各地涌现出的四无新村已经越来越多。这些事实进一步鼓起了人们的干劲，使全省80％的县市，广泛地开展了除四害、讲卫生运动。到去年年底，全省三十四个县市的不完全统计，已在两个月内消灭了麻雀九十五万三千六百多只，老鼠五十六万七千四百多只，积肥四十五万一千八百多大车。如果按每年每只麻雀消耗三斤粮食计算，消灭的麻雀等于减少二百八十万斤粮食的损失，按每年每只老鼠消耗十八斤粮食计算，消灭的老鼠等于减少一千余万斤粮食的损失。据稷山县有关同志谈，每一大车肥料可以增产粮食八斤，那么，上述积肥数量就可以增产粮食三百六十一万余斤。
    为了使全省冬季爱国卫生运动和农业生产大跃进运动相应地发展，并且使这一运动进一步促进农业生产大跃进运动，山西省和太原市曾在去年年底联合举行了除四害、讲卫生广播大会，全省各地约有近百万干部和群众直接收听了大会实况。广播大会上，稷山、屯留、定襄等三个卫生工作先进县，向全省各县提出了及早实现四无县、争取七年实现四无省的倡议。这次大会是全省冬季爱国卫生运动大跃进的开始，一些运动开展得不好的地区，正在设法赶上先进；先进的地区又提出了更高的要求。到去年年底统计，全省有20％县市的卫生运动还没有很好的动起来，其中永济县在今年年初就大有起色，该县中共县委会在干部会议上做了关于除四害的决议，并且在1月4日派出一百多个基层干部，前往稷山县学习，他们听了稷山县领导同志的介绍以后，信心百倍，表示要将原计划在今年培养两个四无乡和二十个四无村改为二百余个四无村。稷山县是先进地区，全县已有一百六十九个卫生模范村，其中还有六十一个村基本上无鼠雀，四个村基本上无四害，但是，该县已提出要在今年达到基本上四无县的奋斗目标。为了实现这个目标，该县中共县委会正在加紧督促检查。
    山西省除四害、讲卫生运动在当前有两大思想障碍：一种出自先进地区，某些基本上消灭了鼠雀的村庄，人们的松劲情绪已经开始流露出来。有的人说：麻雀打得差不多了，留下的十几只都是些滑头滑脑的家伙，它们见人就飞，你怎么打？根据稷山县的经验，必须向干部群众反复说明：留下一些麻雀不打，等它们在开春时繁殖起来，就会前功尽弃；同时要及时提出更高的要求，指出找漏洞等具体措施。这样做的结果，人们的干劲就会越来越大。另一种思想障碍出自落后地区，全省有20％的县市卫生运动开展的不大好，其原因主要是县里的领导干部怕除四害妨碍生产。这说明领导干部中有的同志还不了解，除四害、讲卫生不仅不耽误生产，而且还能大大促进生产。永济县的一些同志到稷山参观以后，所以能大胆的修改原订计划，就是由于他们解除了怕卫生工作耽误生产的顾虑。
