    Agricultural Cooperatives Should Not Promote Sideline Products in Other Provinces

    Agricultural production cooperatives in Shaoyang, Qiyang and other places in Hunan Province often produce some handicraft products (cotton and wool hats, writing brushes, shoes, etc.) and sell them in various parts of Guangxi. Last year, more than ten people directly contacted the Rong'an County Commercial Bureau. For example, in early July, Hu Mingkai and other members of the Shaoyang Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative came to Rong'an to sell writing brushes, carrying more than 2,000 brushes; in mid-December, Tang Zhenyun and other members of the Shuidingtou Township October Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shaodong came to Rong'an to sell cotton and wool hats. Before coming to Rong'an, they had been to Guilin, Liuzhou, Guixian, Laibin and other places. The sales targets are mainly local department stores and cultural stores. The certificates they carry are often issued by the district and township governments, and some only have certificates from their own agricultural cooperatives.

    I think there are several drawbacks to selling sideline products in other provinces in this way: 1. If agricultural cooperatives feel that this kind of business is profitable, they will blindly develop it, which will affect agricultural production; 2. Selling in other places disrupts the handicraft production plans of other provinces and affects the normal development of original handicraft production in other provinces; 3. This kind of handicraft production is extremely blind. They do not understand the needs of the local market in advance, and if they cannot sell, there will be a large backlog, resulting in losses. The travel expenses of the personnel are huge, and sometimes some people even have problems with their return travel expenses; 4. It breeds market speculation. Therefore, I suggest that agricultural cooperatives in various places should not blindly go out to promote sideline products.

### 农业社不应到外省  推销副业产品

    农业社不应到外省
      推销副业产品
    湖南省邵阳、祁阳等地的农业生产合作社经常生产一些手工业产品（棉、羊毛帽子、毛笔、鞋子等）到广西各地推销。去年曾与融安县商业局直接接洽的就有十余人。如7月上旬，邵阳红星农业生产合作社社员胡明凯等来融安推销毛笔，携带数量有二千余支；12月中旬又有邵东水井头乡十月农业生产合作社社员唐震云等到融安推销棉、羊毛帽子。他们到融安前，曾先后到桂林、柳州、贵县、来宾等地。销售对象主要是当地百货、文化商店。他们携带的证明往往多是区、乡政府所发，有的只有本农业社的证明。
    我觉得这样流入省外推销副业产品有几点弊病：1、农业社觉得这种经营有利可图时，就会盲目地去发展，从而就会影响农业生产；2、到外地销售，打乱省外各地手工业生产计划，影响他省原有手工业生产的正常发展；3、此种手工业生产带有极大盲目性，事先不了解外地市场需要，如推销不出去，就会大量积压，造成赔本。人员出差旅费开支庞大，有时有些人连回家路费都成问题；4、滋长市场投机活动。为此，我建议各地农业社不要盲目外出推销副业产品。
