Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 19th: Sichuan University has streamlined its institutions after delegating a large number of cadres to lower levels, fully leveraging the work potential of existing faculty and staff, resulting in a significant improvement in the efficiency of both teaching and administrative work.

In late December of last year, Sichuan University delegated more than 250 cadres to lower levels, accounting for 32.3% of the total number of faculty and staff at the university. Among them were more than 130 professors, associate professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants, and 40 teaching support staff. Although the work originally performed by the delegated teaching staff was entirely taken over by other teachers, teaching work was not affected. In the Biology Department, the proportion of delegated cadres reached 42%, but teaching work actually improved. In the past, school leaders repeatedly emphasized that senior teachers should teach basic courses, but the Biology Department had always assigned young teachers to teach them, resulting in often low teaching quality. For example, the "Botany" course was previously taught by a newly promoted lecturer, and students had many complaints due to the low teaching quality. After this lecturer was delegated to a lower level, Associate Professor Zheng Xuejing took over the course, and the students welcomed it very much. The "Animal Physiology" course for third-year students in the Biology Department was originally taught jointly by an associate professor, two lecturers, and a teaching assistant, but the result was mutual buck-passing, failure to leverage collective effort, and poor teaching results. Now, only two teaching assistants are responsible for this course, under the personal guidance of Department Head Yong Kechang, and it has been well-received by students. After the Russian Language Teaching and Research Group delegated twelve teachers, the remaining twenty teachers took on all the Russian language courses, and also frequently solicited student opinions and improved teaching work. Due to the delegation of a large number of teaching staff, teachers who did not often enter the laboratory and relied on teaching support staff in the past are now changing their style and personally getting involved, frequently entering the laboratory.

The administrative departments such as the President's Office, the Academic Affairs Office, the Scientific Research Department, the Personnel Department, and the General Affairs Office used to have many layers and bloated institutions. Now, all eight sections of the first four departments have been abolished, and the General Affairs Office has also merged six sections into five. However, work efficiency has greatly improved, and many unreasonable phenomena have been eliminated. The Academic Affairs Office originally had sixteen cadres, some of whom had nothing to do during work hours. Now, the entire office has only six cadres, who not only arrange work in a very organized manner but also contact various teaching units to understand the situation more deeply and promptly. The original Property and Affairs Sections of the General Affairs Office used to hinder each other in their work, with one task often shared by two departments. For example, classrooms, conference rooms, and guest houses were managed by the Affairs Section, while faculty, staff, and student dormitories were managed by the Property Section, adding many inconveniences. Now that the two sections have been merged, with nearly half the staff reduced, work is more convenient. In the previous stage of airing views and debates, a big-character poster revealed that a student, in order to complete withdrawal procedures, had to negotiate back and forth between the department office, the Student Affairs Section, the Personnel Department, the Academic Affairs Office, and the President's Office for a month or two. Now, completing such procedures only requires going through two departments.

### 挖掘潜力　紧缩机构  四川大学出现新气象

    挖掘潜力　紧缩机构
    四川大学出现新气象
    新华社成都19日电　四川大学在下放大批干部后，紧缩了机构，充分发挥现有教职员工工作潜力，使教学和行政工作效率都有显著提 高。
    去年12月下旬，四川大学下放干部二百五十多名，占在校教职员总数32.3％。其中教授、副教授、讲师、助教有一百三十多人，教学辅助人员四十人。虽然下放教学人员原来担任的工作全部由其他教师担负起来，但教学工作并未受到影响。生物系下放干部比例达到42％，教学工作却反而有所改进。过去学校领导曾一再强调老教师应讲授基础课，但生物系一直由青年教师讲授，教学质量往往不高。如“植物学”课程过去由一个新提拔的讲师讲授，因教学质量不高，学生意见很多。这个讲师下放后，副教授郑学经担任了这门课程，学生非常欢迎。生物系三年级“动物生理”课，原来由一个副教授、两个讲师和一个助教共同担任，结果互相推诿责任，没有发挥集体作用，教学效果很差。现在，担任这门课程的只有两个助教，由系主任雍克昌亲自指导，得到学生的好评。俄语教研组下放十二个教师后，留校二十个教师担负了全部俄语课程，还经常征求学生意见，改进了教学工作。由于大批教学人员下放，过去不常进实验室和事事依靠教学辅助人员的教师，现在也改变作风亲自动手，常进实验室了。
    校长办公室、教务处、科学研究部、人事处、总务处等行政部门，过去层次多、机构臃肿。现在，前四个部门的八个科已全部撤销，总务处也把六个科合并为五个，工作效率却大大提高，许多不合理现象也消除了。教务处原有十六个干部，有些人在上班时无事可作。现在全处只有六个干部，不仅把工作安排得很有条理，还分别联系各教学单位，了解情况更为深入、及时。总务处原来的校产、事务两科，工作上互相牵掣，一件工作往往由两个部门分担，如教室、会议室、招待所由事务科管理，教、职员和学生宿舍又由校产科管理，增添许多麻烦。现在两科合并，人员减少近一半，工作上反更为方便。在前一阶段鸣放中，有一张大字报揭发：一个学生为了办退学手续，曾经在系办公室、学生科、人事处、教务处、校长办公室之间往返交涉了一两个月。现在，办这样手续只须经过两个部门就解决了。
