Xinhua News Agency, December 31st. Qi Baishi's posthumous works exhibition opened today at the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing. This is the largest exhibition of Qi Baishi's works to date.

The exhibition features more than 700 pieces of Old Man Baishi's remaining paintings, calligraphy, sketches, poetry manuscripts, and self-engraved seals, many of which are rare treasures that have never been seen by the general public. From Old Man Baishi's earliest works—carp painted at the age of twenty—to the chicks, gourds, and orchids painted four or five months before his death, people saw the lifelong hard work and endless creativity of this artistic master, as well as the different genres and styles of his works. The large-scale calligraphy and paintings created by Old Man Baishi at the age of ninety, hanging on the front wall of the hall: "From the masses, to the masses," as well as his many quotations, left a very deep impression on all visitors, especially artists. Old Man Baishi's many famous paintings praising the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and his "Hundred Flowers and Doves of Peace" painted to celebrate the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, as well as many photos, all demonstrated Old Man Baishi's full of political enthusiasm and his contribution to defending world peace.

In order to provide comparison and observation for everyone, this exhibition also simultaneously exhibits some posthumous works of the deceased contemporary painters Huang Binhong and Xu Beihong. From all the exhibits, the audience saw the outstanding contributions and different styles of these three art masters in inheriting and developing the tradition of Chinese painting. As the preface to the exhibition pointed out: "The holding of this exhibition is not only to commemorate Mr. Qi Baishi's hardworking creative life, but also to promote the development of individual creativity on the basis of inheriting tradition, so as to realize the prosperity of creation and the blooming of a hundred flowers," "The different achievements of these three painters will play a role in bridging the past and the future in the growth of our people's new art."

At the exhibition, some posthumous works of Qi Baishi, Huang Binhong, and Xu Beihong, as well as replicas of their posthumous works, are also sold.

    齐白石遗作展出
    新华社31日讯　齐白石遗作展览会今天在北京苏联展览馆开幕，这是齐白石作品的一次规模最大的展出。
    展出的七百多件白石老人的遗画、遗字以及画稿、诗稿和自刻的图章，有不少是从来没有同广大观众见过面的珍品。人们从白石老人最早期的作品——二十岁时画的鲤鱼，到他逝世前四、五个月时画的雏鸡、葫芦、兰花中，看到了这位艺术巨匠的辛勤劳动、无穷创造的一生，以及他的作品的不同体裁和风格。悬在大厅正面壁上的白石老人九十岁时所作的大幅字画：“从群众中来到群众中去”，以及他的许多语录，给所有参观者，特别是美术家们以极深刻的印象。白石老人为歌颂共产党和毛主席而作的多幅名画和他为庆祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议所画的“百花与和平鸽”，以及许多照片，都表现了白石老人饱满的政治热情和他为保卫世界和平所作的贡献。
    为了供大家比较和观摩，这次展览会上还同时展出了已经逝世的同代的画家黄宾虹和徐悲鸿的部分遗作。观众们从全部展品中看到了这三位美术大师在继承和发展中国绘画传统方面的杰出贡献和不同风格。正如展览会的前言中所指出的：“这次展览会的举行，不仅是为了纪念齐白石先生勤劳创作的一生，也是为了提倡在承继传统的基础上发扬个人创造，以实现创作上的繁荣和百花齐放”、“这三位画家的不同成就，在我们人民的新的艺术的成长中，将要起着承前启后的作用”。
    展览会上，还出售齐白石、黄宾虹、徐悲鸿的部分遗作以及他们遗作的复制品。
    今天，陈毅副总理为展览会剪彩。参观展览会的还有李济深副委员长，文化部副部长夏衍、郑振铎，以及北京各界著名人士张治中、邵力子、赖若愚、老舍和著名美术家等共二百多人。
    各国驻中国的外交使节以及正在北京访问的外宾也应邀参观。
    展览会是由文化部和中国美术家协会联合举办的，将自1958年元旦起正式公开展出。
