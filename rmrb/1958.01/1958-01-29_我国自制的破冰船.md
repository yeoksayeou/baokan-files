Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 28th. The two icebreakers designed and manufactured by our country for the first time – "Ke Ling No. 1" and "Ke Ling No. 2" – have recently started breaking ice in the Lijin County section of the lower reaches of the Yellow River.

The river surface of the Yellow River in Lijin County is quite narrow, making it one of the most dangerous sections of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. According to records, of the thirty-five ice jam breaches in the one hundred and two years since the Yellow River changed its course, seventeen occurred here, causing great losses to people's lives and property. Now, these two icebreakers, which were rushed into production by workers at the Shanghai Zhonghua Shipyard in six months, have been advancing at a speed of four kilometers per hour since the 20th, breaking the ice. When encountering ice layers about 30 centimeters thick, they use the method of impact to crush the ice. In this way, a wide waterway is opened up on the sealed river surface, allowing a large number of ice floes floating down from the upper reaches to smoothly enter the sea with the river water.

    我国自制的破冰船
    据新华社济南28日电　我国第一次自己设计、制造的两艘破冰船——克凌一号、二号，最近开始在黄河下游利津县境内破冰。
    利津县境内的黄河河面相当狭窄，是黄河下游最为险要的工段之一。据资料记载，在黄河改道一百零二年的三十五次凌汛决堤中，有十七次发生在这里，给人民生命财产造成很大损失。现在，上海中华造船厂工人用六个月时间赶造好的这两艘破冰船，从20日开始以每小时四公里的速度破冰前进，遇有三十公分厚左右的冰层时，就用冲击的办法把冰层撞碎。这样，就从密封的河面上开辟出一条宽阔的水道，使上游飘浮下来的大量冰块得以顺利地随着河水入海。
