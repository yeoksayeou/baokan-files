    You can work with peace of mind!
    —To my wife who has been sent to the countryside

    Since you were sent to the countryside two and a half months ago, I have taken over all the household affairs. We have been married for more than ten years, and all the housework has always been your responsibility. I don't know anything about it, but I am willing to learn how to manage the household, and only in this way can you go to the countryside to work and train.

    In the past, you often told me that according to our income, there should be some surplus every month. However, since I didn't manage the household, I always thought it was enough as long as it was enough to use. Therefore, often when it came to payday this month, last month's money was also spent. Now I realize this is a big loophole. I had a meeting with the children and revised the family expenditure plan. After receiving the salary, I handed it over to Pingping to deposit it all in the bank, and she will spend according to the plan. Generally, unplanned expenses are not paid. The children are more thorough than us. They have saved more than a hundred yuan in the past two and a half months. Therefore, I bought half as many public bonds as last year.

    Pingping will graduate from elementary school this year. She studies very hard, but she is still greedy for extracurricular reading and cannot arrange her time well. At first, I simply restricted her from reading extracurricular books, and she felt very frustrated. Later, I talked to her once, and now it is arranged like this: from 6:45 to 7:30 every morning, she washes up, heats up breakfast (prepared the night before), cleans the house, empties the chamber pot, folds the quilt, etc. After we finish breakfast together (7:30), she and Fangfang go to school, and I go to work. The one and a half hours she has from returning home from school at noon to going to school in the afternoon can be used to read newspapers and magazines. She usually has two or three hours from returning home from school in the afternoon to dinner. I let her listen to children's radio programs and supervise her younger sister's homework. She also tries to finish her homework for the day at this time (if she can't finish it, she continues after dinner). From 7 to 9 pm after dinner is her formal time for reading extracurricular books. She goes to bed at nine o'clock.

    On Sundays, Pingping has half a day to wash her own clothes and take her sister to take a bath and wash her hair.

    Pingping asked me to tell you that she now feels at ease when doing homework and reading extracurricular books. Unlike in the past, she was distracted, afraid of delaying her homework, and reluctant to put down the books and newspapers she loved to read, wasting a lot of time.

    You are most worried about Fangfang, but she is much better now. Her sister often complains to me: "I can't control my little sister anymore. She runs around everywhere, and I can't find her!" Later, I found that Fangfang didn't have any activities arranged for her for the entire afternoon after school in the morning, so no wonder she couldn't stay still. Now she listens to children's radio programs with her sister every day.

    Doesn't Fangfang like to draw and do handicrafts? I recently bought her a box of plasticine, and she made many small cups, small plates, and small animal toys. Recently, I also bought her a drawing book, and she is willing to draw a picture every afternoon and submit it to me for grading in the evening. The first time I gave her a score of five with a red pen, and her interest in drawing is growing. She also said that she would send you the first picture that got five points to see! I also bought her a shuttlecock. When she is tired of playing in the house, she kicks the shuttlecock in the yard. Her current goal is to kick fifteen.

    You know, in the past, when I came home at night, the children always pestered me and wouldn't let go. They hadn't seen me for a day, and this was their happiest time. They would ask this and say that endlessly, sometimes making noise until after eight or nine o'clock before going to bed. After we tried our best to put them to sleep, we also felt tired. Sometimes we couldn't even read the day's newspaper properly.

    Since I rearranged their time, I have also limited the time I spend entangled with the children at night to within six to seven o'clock. During or around dinner, I talk to the children, chat, ask about school and home matters that day, or learn about their homework. After seven o'clock, everyone does their own thing. This way, I also have more than two hours of study time every night.

    Before you were sent to the countryside, our family life was originally relatively chaotic. When you left, you were a little worried that it would be even more chaotic. Unexpectedly, our lives are now richer and more vibrant. This time, you should be able to work with peace of mind! The children miss you very much and hope you will tell us about your participation in labor training in your next letter.

    你放心的劳动吧！
    ——给下放的妻子

    两个半月前，你下放到农村以后，所有家里的事，就由我承当下来了。我们结婚十几年来，所有家务，一向都是由你负责，我一点也不摸底，但我还是愿意学着管家务，也只有这样，你才能下乡劳动锻炼。
    过去，你常跟我说，按照咱俩的收入，每月应该有些结余。可是由于我不管家务，总以为只要够用就行了。因此，往往到这月发薪时，上月的钱也花光了。现在我才发现这是个大漏洞。我和孩子们开了个会重新修订了家庭开支计划，发工资后，就交给平平全部存入银行，由她按计划开支，没有计划的一般都不支付。孩子们作事比我们还彻底，两个半月来已经结存了百多元。因此，我比去年多买了一半的公债。
    平平今年就要小学毕业了，她学习很用功，只是还贪馋课外读物，时间还安排不好。起初我只单纯限制她看课外读物，她感到很蹩气。后来我跟她谈了一次，现在是这样安排的：每天早上六点三刻到七点半，梳洗、热早点（头天晚上准备好的）收拾屋子、倒痰盂、叠被子等，我们一起吃完早点后（七点半）她和放放上学，我就去上班。她中午放学回家到下午上学前的一个半小时，是可以阅读报纸和杂志的。下午放学回来到晚饭前，一般有两三小时。我就让她听儿童广播节目和督促妹妹作功课，她当天的作业也尽可能这时作完（作不完时晚饭后继续作）晚饭后七至九点，就是她正式阅读课外读物的时间。九点睡觉。
    星期日平平有半天时间洗她自己的衣服，并带着妹妹一起洗澡和洗头。
    平平让我告诉你，她现在作功课和看课外读物心里都踏实了，不像过去，做这想那，又怕耽误功课，又舍不得丢下爱看的书报，浪费了不少时间。
    你最不放心的放放，现在也好多了，姐姐常向我诉苦：“我不管小妹了，她到处跑，找也找不回来！”后来我发现，放放上午下课后，整下午的时间没有给她安排活动，无怪她呆不住。她现在天天由姐姐带着她一起听儿童广播节目了。
    放放不是喜欢画画和做手工吗，我最近给她买了一盒橡皮泥，她作了许多小杯小盘和小动物之类的玩艺儿。最近又给她买了本画谱，她自己愿意在每天下午画一张画，晚上交我给她评分。第一次用红笔给她划了个五分，她画的兴趣越来越大了。还说把第一张得五分的画寄给你看呢！我又给她买了一个毽，在屋里玩腻了，就在院里踢毽，她现在争取的指标是踢十五个。
    你知道，过去我晚上回家，孩子们总缠着不放，一天不见面，这是她们最高兴的时候，问这说那就没个完，有时竟闹到八、九点后还不睡觉。等我们费尽心机把她们弄睡了，自己也感到困倦了。有时连当天的报纸都不能好好地看完。
    自从把她们的时间重新安排后，我也把晚上和孩子们纠缠的时间限制在六至七点之内。在吃晚饭时或吃饭前后和孩子们谈谈聊聊，问问当天学校和家里的事，或了解一下她们功课。七点以后就各做各的事。这样我每天晚上也有了两小时以上的学习时间了。
    你下放前，咱们家庭生活本来比较乱，你走时还有点担心会更乱，想不到，现在我们的生活更加丰富更有生气了。这回，你总该放心的劳动了吧！孩子们很想你，希望你下次来信把参加劳动锻炼的情形告诉我们。
