U.S.-Controlled Middle East Aggression Tool
--The Baghdad Pact Organization--

The Baghdad Pact Organization is an aggressive military bloc cobbled together by the U.S. and Britain in the Middle East, used by them as a tool to split Arab unity and suppress anti-colonial movements in the Middle East. The council of this group is scheduled to hold its fourth meeting in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, starting on the 27th.

For a long time, U.S. and British imperialism has been engaged in activities to organize aggressive military blocs in the Near and Middle East. After the collapse of the U.S.-initiated aggressive plan in October 1951, which rallied the United Kingdom, France, and Turkey to directly organize the "Middle East Command," the U.S. decided to adopt a roundabout strategy: driving Middle Eastern countries to sign bilateral military treaties separately, and then gradually piecing together a Near and Middle East military alliance. Western countries play a manipulative and directive role in it.

In April 1954, the United States planned the military cooperation agreement signed between Turkey and Pakistan. This agreement became the starting point of the Baghdad Pact Organization.

Then, in February 1955, under the instigation of the United Kingdom, Turkey and Iraq signed the "Mutual Cooperation Treaty" in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. The treaty stipulated that other countries, even if they were not in the Near and Middle East, could participate. The United Kingdom then came forward to join the treaty in April of the same year, and Pakistan and Iran also joined in September and October of the same year, respectively. In November, the five member states held the first council meeting in Baghdad, and the Baghdad Pact Organization was officially announced.

The highest body of the Baghdad Pact Organization is the permanent ministerial council of the treaty participating countries. The council has held three meetings since 1955. The council has a secretariat, a military committee (composed of the chiefs of staff and deputy chiefs of staff of the treaty participating countries' armies), an economic committee, and a so-called "anti-subversion committee" to carry out subversive activities.

The United States is not nominally a member of the treaty organization, but it is increasingly strengthening its control over the group and constantly squeezing out Britain, gradually seizing the leadership of the group. At the first council meeting in November 1955, the United States decided to send permanent representatives to politically and militarily contact and control the group's activities. The number of "observers" sent by the United States to attend the council meetings often exceeded the delegations of the treaty member states.

In April 1956, the council held its second meeting. The U.S. representative announced at the meeting that the United States officially joined the treaty organization's economic committee and "anti-subversion committee," which was another step for the United States to tighten its control over the treaty organization.

After this, due to the new upsurge of the national independence movement in the Near and Middle East, the imperialist forces of Britain and France, which had long been entrenched in the Near and Middle East, suffered a series of serious blows, including the failure of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt and the abolition of the British military base in Jordan. The colonial interests of the United Kingdom in the Near and Middle East are increasingly compressed to within the area near the Persian Gulf. At the same time, the United States took the opportunity to further replace it. The notorious "Eisenhower Doctrine" put forward by the United States in January 1957 openly put forward the slogan of so-called "filling the vacuum" in the Near and Middle East. At the third council meeting held in June 1957, the United States announced its participation in the Military Committee and decided to allocate more than 12 million U.S. dollars from the "Eisenhower Doctrine" fund to build railways, highways, and telecommunications linking the capitals of member states, which are considered beneficial to military purposes.

However, this group cannot provide effective services for the United States. The new changes in the balance of international forces and the series of new peace proposals recently put forward by the Soviet Union have had a huge impact in the Near and Middle East. The anti-colonialist and anti-Baghdad Pact forces represented by Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and other countries have become stronger. Representatives from the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, representing more than half of the world's population, have unanimously expressed their opposition to the Baghdad Pact. This situation cannot but be reflected within the Baghdad Group. The 1956 Anglo-French invasion of Egypt failed to gain the support of Baghdad Group member states such as Iran, Pakistan, and Iraq. Unlike Turkey, some Muslim member states are also hesitant to establish missile bases in their own countries. In addition, the various war preparations measures promoted by the United States and Britain have caused member states to make constant material sacrifices, and the economic situation of these countries is becoming increasingly tense. At the same time, the respective problems of these Muslim member states and the differences between them cannot be resolved in the group. Under the influence of these factors, this group is actually in a state of paralysis. Now, the United States has sent a huge "observer group" headed by Dulles, including an army chief of staff, two assistant secretaries of state, and two ambassadors, to attend the fourth council meeting. Its purpose is to cheer up the Baghdad Group and save it from its crisis, so as to further use it to serve the U.S. policy of aggression and war preparation. The people of the Middle East are watching the convening of this meeting with great vigilance. (Xinhua News Agency)

    美国控制下的中东侵略工具
    ——巴格达条约组织——
    巴格达条约组织是美英在中东拼凑的侵略性军事集团，是它们用以分裂阿拉伯国家团结、镇压中东反殖民主义运动的工具。这个集团的理事会定27日起在土耳其首都安卡拉举行第四次会议。
    长久以来，美英帝国主义在中近东进行了组织侵略性军事集团的活动。1951年10月，美国纠合英、法、土耳其三国共同发起直接组织“中东司令部”的侵略计划破产后，美国决定采取迂回的策略，即：驱使中东国家，分别签订军事双边条约，然后逐步拼凑一个中近东军事联盟。西方国家在其中起操纵和指使作用。
    1954年4月，美国策划了土耳其和巴基斯坦签订的军事合作协定。这个协定成为巴格达条约组织的起点。
    接着，在1955年2月，在英国策动下，土耳其和伊拉克在伊拉克首都巴格达签订“互助合作条约”，条约规定，其他国家，即使不是中近东国家，也可以参加。英国随即在同年4月出面参加这个条约，巴基斯坦和伊朗也相继分别在同年的9月、10月参加进来。11月，这五个成员国在巴格达举行第一次理事会会议，巴格达条约组织正式宣告成立。
    巴格达条约组织的最高机构是条约参加国常设部长级理事会，理事会会议自1955年以来已举行过三次。理事会下设秘书处、军事委员会（由条约参加国军队参谋长和副参谋长组成）、经济委员会和进行颠复活动的所谓“反颠复委员会”。
    美国在名义上不是条约组织的成员国，但是它却日益加强对这个集团的控制，并不断排挤英国，步步攫取集团的领导权。在1955年11月的第一次理事会会议上，美国就决定派遣常驻代表，从政治上和军事上联系和掌握这个集团的活动。美国派遣出席理事会历届会议的“观察员”人数，往往超过条约成员国的代表团。
    1956年4月，理事会举行第二次会议。美国代表在会上宣布，美国正式参加条约组织的经济委员会和“反颠复委员会”，这是美国加紧控制条约组织的又一项步骤。
    在这以后，由于中近东民族独立运动的新的高涨，长期盘踞在中近东地区的英法帝国主义势力遭到一连串严重的打击，其中包括，英法侵埃战争的失败，英国在约旦军事基地的撤销等。英国在中近东地区的殖民利益日益被压缩到波斯湾附近地区以内。与此同时，美国乘机企图进一步取而代之，美国在1957年1月提出的臭名昭彰的“艾森豪威尔主义”，就公然提出所谓在中近东地区“填补真空”的口号。在1957年6月举行的理事会第三次会议上，美国又宣布参加军事委员会，并且决定从“艾森豪威尔主义”的基金中拨出一千二百余万美元，修建被认为有利于军事目的的联系成员国首都的铁路、公路和电讯。
    但是，这个集团并不能为美国提供有效的服务。国际力量对比的新变化和苏联最近提出的一系列新的和平建议，在中近东引起了巨大的影响。以埃及、叙利亚、也门等国为代表的反殖民主义、反巴格达条约力量更加强大了。代表世界半数以上人口的参加亚非团结大会的代表已经一致表示反对巴格达条约。这种形势在巴格达集团内部也不能不得到反映。1956年英法侵略埃及的战争，就没有能够得到伊朗、巴基斯坦、伊拉克等巴格达集团成员国的支持。和土耳其不同，某些穆斯林成员国也对在本国境内设立火箭基地表示迟疑。此外，美英推行的种种备战措施，使成员国不断作出物质上的牺牲，这些国家的经济状况日益紧张。同时，这些穆斯林成员国各自的问题以及彼此之间的分歧，也并不能在集团中得到解决。在这种种因素的作用下，这个集团实际上已经陷于瘫痪状态。现在，美国派遣了以杜勒斯为首的、包括一个陆军参谋长、两个助理国务卿、两个大使的庞大的“观察团”出席理事会第四次会议。其目的正是为了给巴格达集团打气，挽救它的危机，以便进一步利用它为美国的侵略备战的政策服务。中东人民正以极大的警惕注视着这次会议的召开。　（新华社）
