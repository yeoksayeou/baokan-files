Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from New York, TASS, 16th dispatch: The latest issue of "Saturday Evening Post" magazine published an article reporting on the unemployment situation in Flint City (Michigan).

    This city has about 200,000 residents; there is the equipment plant of General Motors Corporation, the largest monopoly enterprise in the United States. Due to poor car sales in 1957, Flint City experienced serious unemployment.

    The author wrote: "Now we can already see the characteristics of the 1930s: the melancholy eyes of the unemployed, the unconfident steps, and the pitiful scenes."

    The author pointed out that at the beginning of 1957, there were 23,000 workers in the automobile factory. By mid-August, the number of workers had been reduced to 13,800. The author reported on his conversations with leaders of local trade union organizations, saying that one of the union personnel said that the reason for the unemployment was not only due to the reduction in automobile production, but also due to the adoption of automation. Another union leader said that unemployment is not a temporary phenomenon. Many people are asking the question - how to keep living? Workers cannot repay their debts, and therefore lose the property they purchased on installment plans.

    怎样继续活下去？！
    弗林特城工人的难题
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社纽约16日讯：最近一期“星期六晚邮报”杂志登载了一篇文章，报道弗林特城（密执安州）的失业情景。
    这个城市约有二十万居民；那里有美国最大的垄断企业通用汽车公司的装备厂，1957年汽车销路不畅，弗林特城出现了严重的失业现象。
    作者写道：“现在已经可以看到三十年代的特征了：失业者的忧郁的眼光、没信心的脚步和可怜的情景。”
    作者指出，1957年初在汽车厂有二万三千名工人。到8月中旬工人数目便减少到了一万三千八百名。作者报道他同当地工会组织的领导人进行交谈的情况说，其中有一个工会人员说，失业的原因不仅由于汽车生产的减少，而且也是由于自动化的采用。另外一位工会领导人说，失业并不是暂时的现象。许多人都在提出问题——怎样继续活下去，工人们无法还债，因此就丧失了用分期付款购进的财物。
