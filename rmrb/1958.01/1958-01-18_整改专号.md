    "Rectification Special Issue"
    News Brief No. 72 provides a comprehensive report on rectification efforts in various regions. The screen showcased scenes of people enthusiastically posting big-character posters and responsible comrades reading them, reflecting the improved work situations in various departments. For example, Wu Yuzhang, President of the Renmin University of China, accepted opinions and went deep into the student dormitories and the Department of Agricultural Economics to discuss issues related to water and soil conservation with the students. More than 3,000 mu of fertile land at the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College has been rationally used, no longer left barren; leaders of the Tianjin Paper Mill accepted the opinions of the masses, used iron pipes to retrieve the lost pulp, and the small river that had been muddied by the pulp in the past will be turned into a clear water river.
    The film also recorded the scene of Song Da Niang, a resident of Heping District, Tianjin, raising opinions to the sundry goods store at a street meeting, and the manager of the store posting a big-character poster to express his willingness to humbly accept and promptly improve the work.

    “整改专号”
    新闻简报第七十二号综合报道了各地整改情况。银幕上展示了各地群众踊跃张贴大字报和负责同志们看大字报的情形，表现了各部门改进工作的情况，如中国人民大学吴玉章校长接受意见，深入学生宿舍和农业经济系的同学们谈论关于水土保持的问题。北京农业机械学院的三千多亩良田作了合理使用，不再荒芜了；天津造纸厂领导接受群众意见，用铁管抽回流失的纸浆，过去被纸浆弄浑了的小河将要变成清水河了。
    影片还纪录了天津市和平区居民宋大娘在街道鸣放会上向杂货门市部提意见，门市部经理贴出大字报表示虚心接受并及时改进了工作的情形。　（易卜）
