Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 15th: A signature campaign among the French people to strive for peace in Algeria and oppose the establishment of rocket launching pads on French territory is underway.

The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communiqué on the 14th, expressing its full agreement with the movement initiated by the French National Peace Council. The communiqué pointed out that the working class is struggling to improve its material conditions, while the deterioration of material conditions is caused by the government's continued Algerian war and the implementation of the North Atlantic Group's policy of intensifying its arms expansion.

The National Council of the French Women's Union also issued a statement, calling on French women to "guarantee the complete victory of this great movement."

The French National Peace Council issued a communiqué on the 13th saying that many provincial councils, peace committees, trade union organizations and individuals in various parts of France have requested the Council for questionnaires opposing the establishment of rocket launching pads and advocating negotiations with Algeria. On the 14th, the Peace Council had already received questionnaires signed by many people.

    争取阿尔及利亚和平　反对建立火箭发射台
    法国人民广泛展开签名运动
    据新华社巴黎15日电　法国人民争取阿尔及利亚和平、反对在法国领土上设置火箭发射台的签名运动正在展开。
    法国总工会执行局14日发表公报，表示完全同意法国全国和平理事会发起的这个运动。公报指出，工人阶级为争取改善物质状况而进行斗争，而物质状况的恶化却是由政府继续进行阿尔及利亚战争和执行北大西洋集团加紧扩充军备的政策造成的。
    法兰西妇女联盟全国理事会也发表声明，号召法国妇女“保证这一伟大运动取得完全胜利”。
    法国全国和平理事会13日发表公报说：法国全国各地有许多省议会、和平委员会、工会组织和个人纷纷向理事会索取反对设置火箭发射台、主张同阿尔及利亚谈判的征求民意书。在14日，和平理事会已经收到许多人签名的民意书。
