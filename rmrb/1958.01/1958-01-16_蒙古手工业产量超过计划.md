    Mongolian Handicraft Production Exceeds Plan

    According to a report in the Mongolian "Truth" newspaper on the 14th, the total output of Mongolian handicraft products increased by 52.5% during the Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957). The output of major products such as woodenware, carpets, ready-made clothing, and boots and shoes all exceeded the targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan. The quality of the products has also improved.

    During the Second Five-Year Plan, Mongolian handicraft cooperatives began to produce new products that had never been produced before, such as iron beds and porcelain, and increased new operations.

    The number of handicraft production cooperatives has also increased. Currently, there are more than 100 cooperatives and more than 9,000 members throughout Mongolia.
