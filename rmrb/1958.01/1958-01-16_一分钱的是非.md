Title: The Right and Wrong of One Cent

    The right and wrong here involves contradictions among the people.

    In a breakfast shop, a customer asked a server to add half a bowl of soy milk for him. "Hey, old man, my soy milk is cold. Can you add half a bowl of hot soy milk?" The old server said yes, but it would cost one cent. The customer's face suddenly turned red, "Oh, it costs one cent?" He hesitated for a while (seeming to consider whether to "add" it or not), and finally took out a small coin. After the server left, he muttered with a pout, "Still the old viewpoint, not letting go of even one cent, truly loving money like life!"

    The dispute also happened here.

    Dispute one: Who really loves money like life? "Not letting go of even one cent" naturally seems like "loving money like life"; but if a bowl of soy milk costs two cents, and adding half a bowl costs one cent, isn't that a fair trade? Could "it's cold" and then "adding hot" become a reason not to pay? Drinking half a bowl of soy milk and not wanting to pay one cent, isn't that precisely "loving money like life"? No wonder he particularly emphasized "add", and asked "is it okay?" in a negotiating tone.

    Dispute two: Who really has the "old viewpoint"?

    Saying the server has the "old viewpoint" is observing from the old buying and selling relationship. That is, the so-called "solely seeking profit." But the fact is not like that. This breakfast shop has long been jointly owned by public and private interests and is uniformly managed and led by the National Food Company. Daily income is no longer owned by individuals. "Not letting go of even one cent" is precisely being responsible to the country and the collective, no longer personal "loving money like life." Therefore, the relationship between the customer and the server is no longer that old buying and selling relationship, but also a form of individual relationship with the collective and the country. Giving "one cent" less or drinking half a bowl of soy milk for free harms not only the server personally, but also the interests of many people. This customer's failure to perceive this change in relationship can be regarded as having an "old viewpoint."

    I believe that the change in the nature of relationships between people is of paramount importance. We should observe all problems from this perspective. Thus, I was reminded of the "loving money like life" Yan Jiansheng in The Scholars. Because there were two wicks in the oil lamp, he stretched out two fingers, refusing to close his eyes until death. Although he could no longer speak, he still shook his head wildly at his nephews who were exploring the details of his family fortune, until his wife, who knew his miserly nature, took away one wick, and then he closed his eyes and passed away. Anyone who has read this passage cannot but say that this is a typical image of a mean and stingy petty landlord. If today, someone were to close their eyes in death because of the waste of a little national property, be it a thumbtack for office use, a small nail for construction, or a grain of seed for farming, we cannot but say that this is a model of selfless devotion to protecting national and collective property. Even frugality in personal life to such an extent is still a model of diligence and thrift, because this frugality benefits the entire country and all the people. The main fact is that today's people no longer rely on exploiting others to get rich.

    I believe that some of our comrades need to have a thorough and comprehensive change in their understanding of our relationship with various service industry personnel. This change will greatly improve attitudes towards service personnel. The importance of the right and wrong of one cent lies here.

    一分钱的是非
                何北仁
    这是人民内部的是非。
    在一个早点铺里，一位顾客要一位服务员帮他添半碗豆浆。“喂，老头，我的豆浆凉了，再掺半碗热的行不行？”老服务员说行，但要收一分钱。顾客的脸突然红了，“噢，还要一分钱？”迟疑了一会（看样子是在考虑还“掺”不“掺”了），终于掏出了一个小小的硬币。服务员走后，他却努着嘴嘀咕说：“还是老观点，一分钱也不放过，真是爱钱如命！”
    是非便也发生在这里。
    是非之一：到底谁爱钱如命？“一分钱也不放过”，自然像是“爱钱如命”的；但二分钱一碗豆浆，再添半碗，收一分钱，不失为公平交易吧？难道“凉了”再“掺热的”，就可成为不出钱的理由？喝半碗浆，而不想出一分钱，岂不正是“爱钱如命”？怪不得他特别强调“掺”，而且是用商量的口气问“行不行”了。
    是非之二：倒底谁是“老观点”？
    说服务员是“老观点”，还是从旧的买卖关系来观察的。即所谓“唯利是图”者是也。事实却又并非如此。这家早点铺早已公私合营，统一受国家食品公司的管理和领导了。每日所得已不再为个人所有。“一分钱也不放过”，正是对国家、对集体负责，不再是个人的“爱钱如命”。因而顾客与服务员之间的关系，也再不是那种旧的买卖关系，也属于个人同集体、同国家关系的一种形式。少给了“一分钱”或是白喝了半碗豆浆，损害的不只是服务员个人，而是许多人的利益。这位顾客未能觉察到这种关系的转变，是可以算作“老观点”的。
    我以为人与人之间关系性质的转变，是有头等重要意义的事。我们观察一切问题都要从此着眼。于是，我联想起了儒林外史上那个“爱钱如命”的严监生。因了油灯里有两根捻子，便伸着两只手指，死不肯闭目。虽然话已是不能说了，还要对着他的那些探索家财底细的侄子们乱摇头，直到深知他吝啬性格的妻子，挑去一根灯捻时，才闭目逝去。读过这段文字的，没有人不能说这不是一个刻薄吝啬的小地主的典型。倘在今天，有人因为国家的一点财产的浪费，那怕是办公用的一枚大头针，或是建筑上用的一枚小铁钉，农作上的一粒种籽，而死不瞑目的话，我们又不能不说这是一个大公无私爱护国家和集体财产的典型。即使是对个人生活上的节俭到如此程度，也不失是一个勤俭持家的模范，其原因就是这种节俭对整个国家和全体人民有利。主要的事实是今天的人们再不是依靠克剥别人起家的了。
    我以为，我们的一些同志，在我们同各种服务行业人员关系的认识上，需要有一个彻底和全面的转变。这种转变，会使对服务人员的态度有很大的改善。一分钱的是非的重要性也就在这里。
