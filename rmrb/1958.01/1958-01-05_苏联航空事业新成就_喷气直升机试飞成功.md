Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 4th. A Soviet jet helicopter has successfully completed its test flight. The Soviet "Red Star" newspaper recently published an article introducing the test flight and the helicopter's construction.

The newspaper said that the flight test was conducted by first-class test pilot Garnaev. After he started the engine, the aircraft rose vertically due to the powerful thrust of the jet engine. The aircraft underwent various tests in the air: stalling and falling at a specified altitude, moving forward, backward, and left and right, circling, and finally landing smoothly on an area no larger than the aircraft itself.

"Red Star" reported that this aircraft, manufactured under the leadership of Dr. of Technical Sciences Matveyev, has no wings, tail, or propeller. The aircraft is equipped with a turbine engine. Its rudder is different from ordinary ones. It uses two so-called air rudders directly installed in the engine nozzles to replace the elevators and ailerons. When the air rudder deflects to a certain side under the action of the airflow sprayed behind the engine, it can correspondingly change the aircraft's angle of inclination and pitch angle. The jet rudder, installed at the end of a light frame and powered by air compressed by the engine's compressor, can successfully function as a rudder.

"Red Star" said that now designers will make further improvements based on the test pilot's opinions.

### 苏联航空事业新成就  喷气直升机试飞成功

    苏联航空事业新成就
    喷气直升机试飞成功
    新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联喷气式直升飞机已经试飞成功。苏联“红星报”最近发表文章介绍了试飞情况和直升飞机的构造。
    这家报纸说，这次飞行试验是由一级试飞员加尔纳耶夫担任的。在他开动发动机后，飞机即由于喷气发动机的强大推力而垂直上升。飞机在空中进行了各种试验：在规定高度失速下落，前进、后退、向左右移动，转圈子，最后平稳地落到面积不大于这架飞机的场地上。
    “红星报”说，在这架由技术科学博士马特维耶夫领导制造的飞机上，没有机翼、尾翼、螺旋桨。飞机上装有涡轮发动机。它的舵与一般的不同。它用直接装在发动机喷嘴内的两个所谓气舵代替了升降舵和副翼，气舵在发动机后面喷射的气流作用下向某边偏转，就可以相应地改变飞机的倾斜角和俯仰角。装在一个轻构架末端的射流舵靠发动机的压缩机压出的空气工作，它可以成功地起方向舵的作用。
    “红星报”说，现在设计师们还要根据试飞员的意见作进一步改进。
