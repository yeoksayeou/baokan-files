Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd News: Copenhagen Dispatch: During a Danish parliamentary debate on foreign policy on the 21st, Danish Prime Minister H. C. Hansen, in reference to Bulganin's letters, stated that Denmark supports the proposition of holding a top-level East-West conference. The Danish government agrees that thorough research and preparation must precede a summit meeting; however, the scope and agenda of the summit should be decided by the major powers.

Hansen stated: If the Danish government receives any invitation to participate in a top-level meeting, it will respond affirmatively. In his speech, he emphasized the desire to achieve political reconciliation between East and West.

Hansen also stated that although the United Nations Charter already stipulates that its member states shall not use force, concluding a treaty of mutual non-aggression between East and West could pave the way for agreements on other issues. Therefore, the proposal to sign a mutual non-aggression treaty deserves serious consideration.

He reiterated his opposition to the establishment of atomic rocket bases on Danish territory. He said that the Danish government's stance is based on Denmark's geographical location, and that Denmark's attitude on this issue could help establish an atmosphere conducive to easing East-West tensions.

At the same time, Hansen expressed that he does not oppose the general principle of deploying "modernized weapons" on the territory of Western countries. He also defended Denmark's "close military cooperation" with West Germany within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying it was a "logical result" of the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He rejected Soviet criticism of the alliance's war preparations in the Baltic Sea region.

Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd News: Ottawa Dispatch: Canadian Prime Minister Diefenbaker released in the House of Commons on the 21st his reply to the first letter from Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin.

Diefenbaker said in his letter that the Canadian government supports the idea of holding a top-level meeting "if [such a meeting] can be guaranteed to yield favorable results." He also said that if the participants decide to hold such a meeting in Canada, they would be welcome.

He also said that "thorough preparations must be made through diplomatic and other channels" before holding such a meeting.

His letter stated that the Canadian government is willing to "study" the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

Referring to the issue of disarmament, Diefenbaker said that this issue occupies "a very important position in the thinking" of the Canadian government. At the same time, he attempted to shift the responsibility for the deadlock in disarmament negotiations onto the Soviet Union. In his reply, he also made great efforts to defend the activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the establishment of military bases by the United States in Canada.

When talking about the relationship between Canada and the Soviet Union, Diefenbaker expressed his hope that Canada and the Soviet Union will strengthen exchanges in the economic, social and cultural fields. He said that "at an appropriate time," Canada may send a trade delegation to the Soviet Union to explore the possibility of increasing trade between the two countries.

Diefenbaker said that regarding Bulganin's second letter, the Canadian government is "carefully studying" it and will reply "at the appropriate time."

    丹麦首相赞成召开最高级会议
    重申反对在丹麦设立原子火箭基地
    加拿大总理欢迎高级会议在加举行
    新华社22日讯　哥本哈根消息：丹麦首相汉森21日在丹麦议会辩论外交政策的时候谈到布尔加宁的信件说，丹麦赞成举行高级东西方会议的主张。丹麦政府同意在举行最高级会议之前必须进行透彻的研究和准备，不过有关高级会议的范围和议程应该由大国去决定。
    汉森说：如果丹麦政府接到请它参加最高级会议的任何邀请，它将予以肯定的答复。他在发言里强调希望实现东西方之间的政治和解。
    汉森还说，联合国宪章虽然已经规定它的会员国不得使用武力，但是缔结东西方之间互不侵犯条约可能会为其他问题达成协议铺平道路，因此，签订互不侵犯条约的主张值得认真地加以考虑。
    他重申反对在丹麦境内设立原子火箭基地。他说丹麦政府的这一态度是从丹麦所处的地理位置出发的，他并且说，丹麦在这个问题上的态度可以有助于建立一种促进东西方紧张局势获得缓和的气氛。
    同时，汉森又表示，他并不反对在西方国家领土上部署“现代化武器”的一般原则。他还为丹麦同西德在北大西洋集团范围内“在军事上密切合作”进行辩护，说这是北大西洋集团巴黎会议的“合乎逻辑的结果”。他表示拒绝苏联对于这个集团在波罗的海地区进行备战的批评。
    新华社22日讯　渥太华消息：加拿大总理迪芬贝克21日在下院公布了给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的第一封信的复信。
    迪芬贝克在信中说，加拿大政府支持举行最高级会议的主张，“如果（这种会议）保证可以预料取得有利的结果的话”。他并且说，如果参加者决定这种会议在加拿大举行，他们会受到欢迎。
    他还说，在举行这种会议前“必须通过外交和其他途径进行周密的准备”。
    他的信里说，加拿大政府愿意对中欧建立无原子武器区的主张“加以研究”。
    谈到裁军问题时，迪芬贝克说，这个问题在加拿大政府的“思想上占着非常重要的地位”。同时他又企图把裁军谈判陷于僵局的责任推到苏联身上。他在复信中还竭力为北大西洋公约组织的活动以及美国在加拿大建立军事基地辩护。
    迪芬贝克在谈到加拿大同苏联的关系时，表示希望加拿大和苏联将加强在经济、社会和文化方面的交流。他说，“在适当的时候”，加拿大可能派一个贸易代表团到苏联去了解增加两国之间的贸易的可能性。
    迪芬贝克说，关于布尔加宁的第二封信，加拿大政府正在“仔细研究”，他将在“适当的时候”予以答复。
