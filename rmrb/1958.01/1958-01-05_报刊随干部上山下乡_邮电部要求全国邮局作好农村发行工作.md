    Newspapers and Periodicals Follow Cadres to the Countryside
    Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Requires Post Offices Nationwide to Do a Good Job in Rural Distribution

    (Our newspaper's report) Many newspapers and periodicals that could not previously penetrate the countryside are now going up the mountains and down to the villages along with the dispatched cadres. This is a further development of culture penetrating into rural mountain areas. In order to meet the needs of dispatched cadres for newspapers and periodicals, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has issued a notice requiring post offices nationwide to cooperate with the dispatch of cadres, pay close attention to the distribution of newspapers and periodicals in rural areas, and strengthen the promotion, subscription, and retail sales of newspapers and periodicals. In addition to retail sales of newspapers and periodicals at the counters of post offices in major cities, mobile retail sales can also be organized as needed, and attention should be paid to the retail sales of newspapers during major political events and holidays to meet the needs of readers.

    Another dispatch: Many post offices have taken specific measures based on the notice of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. In order to strengthen the newspaper and periodical subscription work in the suburbs of Beijing, some suburban post offices have organized personnel to go to various agricultural cooperatives in turn on the dates when dispatched cadres receive their salaries to collect subscriptions and sell newspapers and periodicals. The Shanghai Post Office has also strengthened the retail sales of newspapers and periodicals in the suburbs to facilitate the purchase of newspapers and periodicals by cadres in the countryside. Post offices in Harbin, Zhengzhou, Fuzhou, and other places stipulate that if cadres are dispatched or transferred, the originally subscribed newspapers and periodicals can be forwarded free of charge. In order to enable dispatched cadres in the suburbs to see newspapers and periodicals in a timely manner, the Nanjing Post Office is planning to transfer cadres to strengthen rural postal work and strive to achieve postal service in every cooperative and daily postal service in a short period of time. Post offices in Beijing and Shanghai have begun to establish newspaper and periodical promotion stations in agricultural cooperatives that already have dispatched cadres. These measures have been welcomed by the dispatched cadres.

    报刊随干部上山下乡
    邮电部要求全国邮局作好农村发行工作
    本报讯　过去不能深入农村的许多报刊，现在也随着干部下放而上山下乡了，这是文化深入农村山地的进一步的发展。邮电部为了满足下放干部对报刊的需要，已发出通知，要求全国邮电局配合干部下放，密切注意农村的报刊发行工作，加强报刊的宣传、收订和零售。各大城市除各邮电局门市零售报刊外，还可根据需要组织流动零售，并注意重大政治事件和节日报纸的零售工作，以适应读者需要。
    又讯　许多邮电局根据邮电部通知，已采取具体措施。北京市邮局为了加强郊区的报刊收订工作，有的郊区邮局已组织力量，按下放干部发薪日期到各农业社去轮流收订和零售报刊。上海邮局也加强了郊区的报刊零售工作，以便利下乡干部零买报刊。哈尔滨、郑州、福州等地邮局规定，如干部下放或调动，原订的报刊可以免费改寄。南京市邮局为了使郊区的下放干部能及时看到报刊，正计划抽调干部加强乡邮工作，争取短期达到社社通邮，天天通邮。北京、上海两地邮局已开始在已有下放干部的农业社中建立报刊推广站。这些措施都受到了下放干部的欢迎。
