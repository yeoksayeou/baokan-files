    In Henan Province, more than 2.6 million illiterate people in rural areas have received literacy graduation certificates, acquired basic reading and writing skills, and become cultured people. Three townships, thirty-nine agricultural cooperatives, and one hundred and eighty-five villages across the province have basically eliminated illiteracy ahead of schedule, meeting the requirements of the Agricultural Development Program, and becoming cultural townships, cooperatives, and villages. In these townships and cooperatives, more than 75% of illiterate people have reached the literacy graduation standard.

    Having culture provides many favorable conditions for production, work, and study. Literacy graduates can generally read popular books and newspapers, write simple letters, and draft production plans. Many have taken on roles such as work-point recorders and production technicians in agricultural cooperatives, solving the difficulty of agricultural cooperatives lacking literate people. Xu Wenjiang, the Party Branch Secretary of the Longtang Agricultural Cooperative in Guangshan Longtang Township, used to be illiterate, unable to understand documents, and felt frustrated when encountering difficulties in his work. After becoming literate, he could write his own notices, make plans for his work, and his work ability and policy understanding significantly improved. In many agricultural cooperatives, libraries and clubs have also been established, and the masses of farmers have developed good habits of reading books and newspapers. Through self-study, they have consolidated their learning achievements and further expanded their knowledge, which has greatly promoted work efficiency and improved production. The Haocun Agricultural Cooperative in Xinxiang increased cotton production due to the members' learning of agricultural techniques. Director Jiang Dongfang said: "With culture, the commune members have great enthusiasm for production, cotton production increases year after year, and every household's income increases."

    In order to consolidate learning outcomes and further improve cultural levels, 195,000 people across the province have entered spare-time primary schools, and more than 60,000 people have entered farmers' spare-time middle schools to continue their studies.

    社员有文化　生产劲头大
    河南省农村已经有二百六十多万文盲领到了识字毕业证书，获得了初步的读、写能力，变成了有文化的人。全省已有三个乡，三十九个农业社和一百八十五个村基本扫除了文盲，提前实现了农业发展纲要的要求，变成了文化乡、社和文化村了。在这些乡、社里，75％以上文盲都已达到扫盲毕业标准。
    有了文化，给生产、工作和学习提供了许多有利条件。扫盲毕业学员一般能阅读通俗的书报，写简单的信，订生产计划等。很多人担任了农业社的记工员、生产技术员等工作，解决了农业社缺乏识字人的困难。光山龙塘乡龙塘农业社的党支书徐文江，过去不识字，文件看不懂，工作中遇到困难直发急，识字以后，通知自己写，工作订有计划，工作能力和政策水平有了显著提高。在不少农业社里还成立了图书馆、俱乐部，农民群众都养成了阅读书报的良好习惯。通过自修巩固了学习成绩，也进一步扩大了知识领域，对提高工作效率，改进生产起了很大推动作用。新乡郝村农业社由于社员学习了农业技术，提高了棉花的产量。社长姜东方说：“社员有文化，生产劲头大，棉花年年增产，家家收入增加”。
    为了巩固学习成果，进一步提高文化水平，全省已有十九万五千人升入业余小学，有六万多人升入了农民业余中学继续学习。
