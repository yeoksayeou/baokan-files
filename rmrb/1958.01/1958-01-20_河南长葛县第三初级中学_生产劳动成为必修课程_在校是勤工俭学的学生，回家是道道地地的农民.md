Henan Changge County No. 3 Junior High School
Productive Labor Becomes a Compulsory Course
Students are Diligent Students at School, and Thorough Farmers at Home

(Reported by our newspaper) Changge County, Henan Province, has seen the emergence of a thrifty, simple, labor-loving, energetic, politically enthusiastic, and happy socialist school. This is Changge County No. 3 Junior High School, which has adhered to the principle of diligent work and study for the past three years, studying and working at the same time. In this school, in addition to the general junior high school courses, productive labor is also a compulsory course; participation in production has become a regular activity for students.

The school has reclaimed 38.1 mu of arable land, divided into six experimental zones: a teaching experimental zone for cultivating various crops; a large field crop zone distributed to each class production team, mainly planting high-yield crops (such as corn, wheat, sweet potatoes, and peanuts); a technical crop zone for planting tobacco, cotton, and sugarcane; and also vegetable areas, orchards, and nurseries. There is also a simple animal breeding park on campus, raising chickens, rabbits, fish, pigs, bees, etc. The school's eighteen classes are organized into eighteen production teams, each with its own cultivated area. The whole school has a collective labor activity once a week, and two extracurricular activity periods every day, one for physical education and one for rotating participation in production and learning agricultural techniques. Each year, tasks are proposed according to the season, everyone discusses them; and production experiences are summarized and production models are commended in a timely manner.

In this school, there are not only pens, chalk, compasses, and set squares; but also 145 various large and small production tools. To accumulate fertilizer, each class has two or three manure pits and three to five urine containers. The whole school has built four pig pens, raising thirteen pigs. This winter, it has already accumulated 400 cartloads of fertilizer, 27,000 jin of urine fertilizer, and 20,000 jin of swept leaves. The masses say that this foreign-style school is different from others, it has everything including branch forks, rakes, brooms, and cattle muzzles! This is a school that has been transformed by labor.

In the process of adhering to diligent work and study, the school has launched a struggle against various incorrect ideas. For example, some students regard going to school as a means of escaping physical labor, coming from the countryside but not wanting to return to the countryside. Some well-intentioned teachers are afraid that this will affect the school's "normal order" and affect students' studies. However, the result of three years of practice is that students have not only mastered production skills, but also have excellent academic performance. For example, of the 295 graduates in 1957, 75 students were admitted to higher-level schools, with an admission rate of 25%; while during the same period, the average admission rate of schools in Xuchang Prefecture was only 15%. Looking at the 220 students who did not go on to higher education and returned home to engage in production, they are not only content with ordinary labor, but also, in just half a year, 53 of them were rated as production models. According to the statistics of 106 graduates, 12 are working as record keepers, 43 as accountants, 19 as Communist Youth League branch secretaries, 2 as management district directors (i.e., chairmen of cooperatives), and 2 as production team leaders. They not only have a love of labor, but also, because they have learned production skills, they do not need to be "trainees" when they go to agricultural production posts. According to the Henan dialect, they are "thorough" new-style farmers when they leave the school.

Cultivating socialist laborers is the most important harvest of Changge No. 3 Middle School. At the same time, they have also achieved economic harvests. In 1957, the average grain yield per mu was 560 jin, exceeding the requirements of the Agricultural Development Program. A total of more than 18,000 jin of grain, more than 17,000 jin of sweet potatoes, more than 3,800 jin of peanuts, more than 27,000 jin of vegetables, and income from eggs, fruits, etc. The distribution of these proceeds is: expanding reproduction, purchasing agricultural tools, building libraries and reading rooms, subscribing to newspapers and magazines, bathing, watching movies, improving meals, and providing relief to students with temporary special difficulties.

Students' love of labor and labor skills have further promoted various activities of labor building schools and diligent work-study programs. In the past few years, students have participated in their own labor in the process of building the school without exception. For example, the several thatched houses built last year, except for the nails and some materials that were purchased, the adobe was made by themselves, the roof was made of wheat straw grown by themselves, and the rafters were replaced by sunflower stalks grown by themselves. Students participated in the construction of the school's walls and roads. Through these activities, they realized that building socialism requires increasing production and practicing economy, and doing it yourself. Therefore, although the school's equipment is simple, they do not complain, but constantly use tenacious labor to improve the conditions for learning. In the past few years, they have continuously planted 28,714 trees in the campus, along the road, and on wasteland, and built two forests covering 20 mu. In addition, students have been able to use their own labor to solve some of their own difficulties. According to the statistics of 606 students during the 1957 summer vacation, they earned more than 325,000 work points in 80 days of labor, equivalent to more than 16,000 yuan in Renminbi. Therefore, the number of students receiving financial aid has also decreased from 549 people and 5,767 yuan to 324 people and 2,737 yuan.

### 河南长葛县第三初级中学  生产劳动成为必修课程  在校是勤工俭学的学生，回家是道道地地的农民

    勤工俭学　边读边耕
    长葛和仁怀两所中学的办学方法值得提倡
    河南长葛县第三初级中学
    生产劳动成为必修课程
    在校是勤工俭学的学生，回家是道道地地的农民
    本报讯　河南省长葛县出现了一所勤俭、朴素、热爱劳动、生气勃勃、政治空气高涨、快乐的社会主义学校。这就是三年来坚持勤工俭学，一面读书，一面劳动的长葛县第三初级中学。在这所学校里，除了一般初级中学的课程以外，生产劳动也是必修课；参加生产已经成为学生经常性的活动。
    这个学校开垦了可耕地三十八亩一分，分作六个试验区：有培植各种作物的教学实验区；有分给各班生产队，主要种植高额丰产作物（如玉米、小麦、甘薯、花生）的大田作物区；有种植烟叶、棉花、甘蔗的技术作物区；还有蔬菜区，果树区和苗圃区。校内还有简单的动物饲养园，养有鸡、兔、鱼、猪、蜜蜂等。全校十八个班组成十八个生产队，各队都有自己的耕作区。每星期全校有一次集体劳动，每天两节课外活动，一节作体育活动，一节轮流参加生产，学习农业技术。每年按季节耕种，提出任务，大家讨论；并及时总结生产经验，表扬生产模范。
    在这所学校里，不仅有钢笔、粉笔、圆规和三角板；而且有各种大小生产工具一百四十五件。为了积肥，各班都有二、三个粪坑，三、五个尿罐。全校打猪圈四个，养猪十三头，冬季已积肥四百车，尿肥二万七千斤，扫树叶二万斤。群众说，这个洋学堂，跟别的不一样，杈、耙、扫帚、牛笼嘴，啥都有！这是一所劳动化了的学校。
    学校在坚持勤工俭学的过程中，同各种不正确的思想展开了斗争。例如有些学生把上学看作是摆脱体力劳动的手段，从农村来，而不愿回农村去。有些好心肠的教师，害怕这样会影响学校的“正常秩序”，影响学生的学习。但是，三年实践的结果，学生们不仅掌握了生产技能，而且学习成绩也是优良的。如1957年毕业生二百九十五人，升入高一级学校的学生七十五人，升学率占到25％；而同一时期，许昌专区各校平均升学率仅为15％。再看没有升学、回家生产的二百二十名学生，他们不仅安于平凡的劳动，而且仅半年时间，就有五十三名被评为生产模范。据一百零六个毕业生的统计，当记工员的十二人，会计四十三人，团支书十九人，管理区主任（即社长）二人，生产队长二人。他们不仅有了爱劳动的品质，而且由于学会了生产技能，到农业生产岗位上，也不用再当“练习生”了。按河南土话的说法：他们出校门，就是“地地道道”的新式农民了。
    培养了社会主义劳动者，这是长葛三中最主要的丰收。同时，他们经济上也得到了丰收。1957年，平均亩产粮食五百六十斤，超过农业发展纲要的要求。共收粮一万八千多斤，甘薯一万七千多斤，花生三千八百多斤，蔬菜二万七千多斤，还有鸡蛋、水果等收益。这些收益的分配是：扩大再生产，购置农具，盖图书馆、阅览室，订报和杂志，洗澡，看电影，改善伙食和救济临时有特殊困难的学生。
    学生们有了爱劳动的品质和劳动的技能，更加推动了劳动建校和勤工俭学的各种活动。几年来在建校过程中，学生们没有一次不投入自己的劳动。例如去年盖的几间草房，除了铁钉和部分材料是购买的以外，坯是自己打的，屋顶用的是自己种的麦秸，椽子用的是自己种的向日葵杆代替的。学校修围墙，修道路，学生们都参加了劳动。通过这些活动，使他们认识到建设社会主义必须增产节约、自己动手。因此，学校的设备虽然简陋，他们并没有怨言，而是不断地用顽强的劳动去改善学习的条件。几年来，他们连续在校园内、公路旁、废地上植树达二万八千七百一十四株，并造了二十亩大的两个树林。此外，学生们已经可以用自己的劳动来解决自己的一些困难，据1957年暑假期间六百零六个学生的统计，他们八十天的劳动共挣工分三十二万五千多个，合人民币一万六千多元。因此，全校享受助学金的学生，也由五百四十九人、五千七百六十七元，降低到三百二十四人，二千七百三十七元。
