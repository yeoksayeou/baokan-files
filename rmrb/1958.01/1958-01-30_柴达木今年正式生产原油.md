Xinhua News Agency, Da Qaidan, January 29th: The vast number of workers in the Qaidam Basin are launching a high tide of development and construction in the basin in order to realize the 1958 plan.

The Qaidam Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on criticizing right-leaning conservative ideology, formulated the 1958 Qaidam Basin Work Outline in accordance with the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical. When the workers and masses discussed this outline, they put forward many constructive opinions. The workers expressed that they would strive for the thorough realization of the outline and the overfulfillment of this year's plan.

This year, the footage of exploration wells in the Qaidam Basin will be about twice as much as last year, and it will also begin to provide the state with some data on recoverable reserves of crude oil, and officially produce crude oil for the state.

The Xitieshan Geological Team of the Ministry of Geology is still working hard in the severe cold. This year, they will basically complete the exploration of Xitieshan. Submit to the state the rough data of the entire Xitieshan metallic lead.

This year, Qaidam will also establish a number of small local mining factories (sites) to exploit the mineral resources that have been explored. A large number of cadres who have been transferred to lower levels have also happily thrown themselves into the labor production of these emerging enterprises. They humbly learn from the veteran workers and begin to study tunneling technology.

A high tide of agricultural production is also taking shape in the eight state-owned farms in the Qaidam Basin. Employees of other systems such as highway transportation, geological survey, postal and telecommunications, and financial and trade are also working hard to complete and over fulfill this year's production plans.

    今年柴达木盆地的探井进尺比去年大一倍左右，还要开始提供国家一部分原油可采储量的资料，并且正式为国家生产原油。
    地质部锡铁山地质队，现在仍在严寒中紧张进行各种生产工作。他们今年要基本完成锡铁山的勘探工作。向国家提交整个锡铁山金属铅的粗略资料。
    柴达木今年还将兴办一批地方开采的小型厂（场）来开采已经勘探出来的矿产资源。大批下放干部也愉快地投入了这些新兴企业的劳动生产。他们虚心向老工人学习，开始钻研掘进技术。
    农业生产高潮也在柴达木盆地的八个国营农场里形成。其他公路交通，地质普查、邮电通讯、财经贸易等系统的职工也开始了为完成和超额完成今年的生产计划紧张地工作着。
