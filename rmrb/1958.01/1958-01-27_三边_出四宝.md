"Three Borders" Yield Four Treasures
　　Farmers in the Zhangjiapan and Liuguiwan areas of Jingbian, Shaanxi Province, use the secretions of a kind of insect on willow trees to boil sugar for consumption. This "insect sugar" is the same color and taste as ordinary brown sugar. In ancient times, "Three Borders Three Treasures" (licorice, fur, salt) were known. Now with insect sugar, it has become four treasures.

　　According to local people, this insect mostly parasitizes on young willow trees with smooth bark, and there are many and widespread willow trees planted in this area. If the relevant departments test this sugar, it may be widely promoted for boiling, as a substitute for brown sugar.

    “三边”出四宝
    陕西靖边张家畔、柳桂湾一带农民利用柳树上一种虫子的分泌物熬制成糖作为食用。这种“虫糖”的色泽、滋味和普通红糖一样。古人称“三边三宝”（甘草、皮毛、盐），如今有了虫糖，便成为四宝了。
    据当地群众说，这种虫子多寄生在比较年青、皮杆光滑的柳树上，而这一带种植的柳树极多、极普遍。如果有关部门对这种糖予以检验，可能大量推广熬制，作为红砂糖的代用品。
