Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 20th. On the 19th, a Sunday, two million adult women in Shanghai mobilized to eliminate pests. They were determined to transform their families into "Five-Without Households" – without flies, mosquitoes, rats, bedbugs, and cockroaches. In some neighborhoods, 100% of the women mobilized, and in most neighborhoods, the rate was above 80%. Shantytowns and employee family residential areas were thoroughly cleaned indoors and outdoors, and overwintering mosquitoes and flies could no longer be found. In Shangrong New Village in Dongchang District, every household mobilized to wash down fences and garbage cans, which are prone to breeding mosquitoes and flies. Those who were old or weak and unable to participate in the cleaning organized temporary nurseries to look after the children. This new village continued to attack rats and other pests indoors on the 20th.

On the 19th, many leaders of Shanghai's municipal organs also rolled up their sleeves and led their families in searching for pests, climbing up and down. Zhu Hui, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, specifically convened a family meeting the night before to mobilize and clean up overnight. In the afternoon, responsible cadres of the Shanghai Women's Federation participated separately in inspection and propaganda teams consisting of 40,000 to 50,000 people in each district, and inspected workshops, neighborhoods, dormitory of organ cadres, and shantytowns.

    “五无家庭”的口号响遍上海
    二百万妇女星期天出动除五害
    新华社上海20日电　19日是星期天，上海在这一天有二百万成年妇女出动除害虫。她们决意把自己的家庭变为无蝇、无蚊、无鼠、无臭虫、无蟑螂的“五无家庭”。有的里弄妇女百分之百地动起来，一般里弄也在80％以上。棚户区和职工家属集居区室内室外都打扫得干干净净，整整齐齐，已找不到过冬的蚊子和苍蝇。东昌区上溶新村家家户户出动，把容易孳生蚊蝇的篱笆杆和垃圾箱都用水冲洗过。老弱的人不能参加打扫便组织了临时托儿所，代人看孩子。这个新村20日又继续向室内的老鼠等进攻。
    在19日这一天，上海市好多机关的负责人也都卷起袖子，带领全家，爬上爬下地找害虫。中共上海市委政法部副部长朱辉，在头天晚上特地召开家庭会议动员，连夜打扫。下午，上海市妇联负责干部分头参加了由有四、五万人组成的各区检查队和宣传队，分别到工房、里弄、机关干部宿舍、棚户区进行了检查。
