    Uncoverable Contradictions
    The Council of the European Parliamentary Assembly of Fifteen nations encountered two difficulties while discussing the plan for the Common Market of the six Western European countries. One was the question of where the headquarters of the six-nation "Little Europe" should be located. It is said that the parliamentary meeting has already decided that, "due to national animosity," the meeting will not discuss this issue to avoid "further complicating the problems dividing the six 'Little Europe' nations." The other was the relationship between the Common Market and the broader "Free Trade Area" advocated by Britain. The six Common Market countries demanded that the European Commission support the Common Market treaty. However, Britain, rallying the Scandinavian countries, believed that it would be easier to discuss this issue "after the Common Market plan has been completed and expanded by the Free Trade Area." Agence France-Presse described this event as "another episode of underlying antagonism."
    Whether it is the Common Market or the Free Trade Area, the proponents all tout "unity" and "unification" of European countries. But paper cannot contain fire, and whenever interests conflict, contradictions are exposed.

    盖不住的矛盾
    十五国的欧洲委员会议会在讨论西欧六国共同市场的计划时遇到了两个难题。一个是关于六国“小欧洲”的总部应当设在那里的问题。据说议会会议已经决定，“由于民族的敌对情绪”，会议不讨论这个问题了，以免“使分裂着‘小欧洲’六国的问题进一步复杂化”。另一个是关于共同市场和英国所主张的更广泛的“自由贸易区”的关系问题。共同市场六国要求欧洲委员会支持共同市场条约。但是英国纠集了斯堪的纳维亚国家，认为这个问题在共同市场计划“经自由贸易区完成和扩大以后”再来讨论要容易得多。法新社把这件事情形容为“潜在的对立情绪的又一插曲”。
    共同市场也好，自由贸易区也好，倡导者都是以欧洲国家的“团结”、“统一”相标榜的。但是纸包不住火，每当利害发生抵触的时候，矛盾就暴露出来。
