Toothbrushes, Toothpowder, Toothpaste

Many people think adults should use large toothbrushes, and only children should use small toothbrushes. In fact, adults should also use small toothbrushes. This is because small toothbrushes are more flexible in the mouth and can clean the back teeth. Large toothbrushes, on the other hand, are restricted by the muscles of the corners of the mouth and are difficult to reach the back of the oral cavity. Moreover, even if the toothbrush is large, only about two-thirds of the front can be used.

Some people think the harder the bristles, the better. In fact, hard bristles easily injure the gums and even damage the enamel layer of the tooth surface. Domestically produced pig bristle toothbrushes have very good hardness and are inexpensive.

A suitable toothbrush is: a straight and long handle for easy grip; a brush head that is not too large for easy rotation in the mouth; two rows of bristles on the brush head, six tufts in each row, with slightly larger gaps between the tufts for easy cleaning of the toothbrush; the tips of the bristles should be sharper, and the entire bristle surface should be convex or concave rather than completely flat, making it easier to clean the gaps and depressions between the teeth.

After each use, the brush head should be placed upwards with the bristles facing inward in a cup to allow it to dry. Putting it in a toothbrush box is not a good idea.

Each toothbrush can generally be used for two or three months. When the bristles are found to be leaning in all directions, it is time to replace it with a new one, as it is unhygienic after prolonged use and can easily injure the gums.

Toothpowder and toothpaste are generally made from magnesium carbonate (or calcium carbonate), soap foam, disinfectant, preservative, coolant, fragrance, and lactose, etc.

Magnesium carbonate or calcium carbonate is a fine powder insoluble in water. When brushing teeth, this powder rubs against the teeth and removes dirt adhering to the teeth.

To kill bacteria in the mouth, toothpowder and toothpaste often contain a small amount of disinfectants and preservatives—potassium chlorate, refined salt, quinine, etc. To eliminate bad breath, some antipyretic coolants and fragrances are added—coolants such as peppermint oil and fragrances such as rose oil, sandalwood oil, and wintergreen oil. In addition, there are some insignificant supplementary materials, such as starch, talc, and the like.

The ingredients of toothpowder and toothpaste are similar, but toothpaste also contains some viscous liquids, such as glycerin syrup, honey, etc. Therefore, toothpaste is more convenient and comfortable than toothpowder in terms of preservation and use.

Many people often like toothpastes that are foamy, have a strong cooling sensation, and a strong fragrance. However, more foam means more soap foam is added. Soap contains weak alkalinity, and too much will irritate and damage the delicate oral mucosa and gums; and with more foam, the friction effect of the toothpaste is relatively reduced. So more foam is not necessarily better. Toothpastes with a strong cooling sensation can also irritate the mouth and have no benefits. The fragrance of toothpaste is only for flavoring and does not affect the cleaning effect of the toothpaste. A good toothpaste usually contains 40% abrasive, and other ingredients should be properly controlled as needed and should not be excessive. (Cong, Yu)

### 牙刷·牙粉·牙膏

专栏：怎样选购商品

    牙刷·牙粉·牙膏
    许多人以为大人应该用大牙刷，小孩子才用小牙刷。其实大人也应该用小牙刷。因为小牙刷在口内转动灵活，可以刷干净后面的牙齿。大牙刷则受口角肌肉限制，很难伸到口腔后面去。而且牙刷虽大，可以利用的也不过是前三分之二左右。
    有人以为毛越硬越好。其实硬毛易伤牙肉，甚至把牙面的一层牙釉质都刷坏了。国产的猪鬃毛牙刷硬度就很好，价钱又低廉。
    合用的牙刷是：刷柄直而长，以便于握住；刷头不太大，以便于在口中转动；刷头上两排毛，每排六束，毛束之间空隙稍大些，以便于洗净牙刷；毛的顶端要尖些，整个毛面以凸形或凹形的比完全平齐的好，容易刷净牙缝及凹处。
    每次用后，应将刷头向上刷毛向内插在杯中，使它干燥。放在牙刷盒里不是好办法。
    每把牙刷一般可用二、三个月。发现刷毛西倒东歪的时候就该换新的，用久了不卫生，还易伤牙肉。
    牙粉和牙膏，一般都是由碳酸镁（或碳酸钙）、肥皂沫、消毒剂、防腐剂、清凉剂、香料和乳糖等配制而成。
    碳酸镁或碳酸钙都是一种不溶于水的细粉末。刷牙时，这种粉末同牙齿摩擦，就可以除去粘附在牙上的污物。
    为了消灭口中的细菌，牙粉和牙膏中还常常加入少许消毒剂和防腐剂——氯酸钾、精盐、金鸡纳霜等。为了消除口中的臭味，还加些解热的清凉剂和香料——薄荷油之类的清凉剂及玫瑰油、檀香油和冬青油之类的香料等。此外，就是一些无关紧要的补充材料，如淀粉、滑石粉之类的东西。
    牙粉和牙膏的成分差不多，不过在牙膏中，还有一些粘稠的液体，如甘油糖浆、蜂蜜等。因此，在保存和使用方面，牙膏比牙粉都要方便、舒服一些。
    许多人往往喜欢用泡沫多、凉味大、香味浓的牙膏。但是，泡沫多就是肥皂沫加多。肥皂含有微弱的碱性，太多了，会刺激和损害娇嫩的口腔粘膜和牙床；并且泡沫多了，也就相对地减低了牙膏的摩擦效用。所以泡沫多并不一定好。凉味大的牙膏，也会刺激口腔，没有什么好处。牙膏的香味，只是为了调味，都无碍于牙膏的清洁作用。一种好牙膏，通常摩擦剂占40％，其他成分都应按需要适当控制，不宜过多。（琮、予）
