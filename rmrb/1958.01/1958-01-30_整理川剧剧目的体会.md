Experiences in整理川剧剧目
Zhang Minquan, Vice President of the Chongqing 川剧院

Editor's note: Last year, the Chongqing 川剧院 performed excellent plays such as "The Biography of Fu Nu" and "The Adventures of Lord Qiao" during its tour. Earlier, the Chengdu 川剧团 was also well-received by audiences for plays like "Tan Ji'er" and "Pulling a Husband." Many of these were plays that had been lost for a long time or had not been performed for decades, allowing audiences to further recognize the richness of our national opera heritage and the people's artistic creativity. In recent years, 川剧 artists have made significant achievements in the work of exploring and整理traditional plays. Implementing the mass line in their work is a good experience for them. They especially value mobilizing and uniting veteran artists, actors, and staff to carry out exploration and整理work. In performances, they also continuously absorb audience opinions to make revisions. Their experiences are worthy of attention in the opera circle.

Our院 has made some efforts in exploring and整理traditional plays in recent years, in accordance with the central government's opera reform policy and instructions to explore and整理 national heritage. Before 1954, although some experiments were made, the capitalist management perspective, which undervalued traditional plays, did not emphasize quality in the翻改 and newly written scripts, and discarded each play after it was performed once, led to a shortage of plays, low attendance rates, and greatly affected the development of the院 and the lives of the artists. From 1955, under the leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department and the Municipal Culture Bureau, the capitalist management perspective was examined and criticized, and the instructions to explore and整理traditional plays, enrich the repertoire, and improve the quality of performances were resolutely implemented. Education on opera reform policies was conducted for all actors and staff, and veteran artists and leading actors were mobilized to carry out exploration and整理 work. There are many 川剧 plays, and selecting programs is the primary step. We studied the audience's demands at that time and made necessary improvements in our work. The audience in Chongqing, especially the working-class audience, was dissatisfied with our performance repertoire. Audiences criticized us for having to "重台" in less than a week, performing only a few plays repeatedly. Audiences wanted to see large-scale plays that were full of struggle, strongly pro-people, had a beginning and an end, had both male and female characters, had relatively lively plots, and had clear love and hate. Upon checking based on this requirement, we could not select many good plays from our performance repertoire. Moreover, several plays with relatively good quality, such as "The Story of Willow Shade" and "The Tale of the Jade Hairpin," had also been performed too many times, and the audience was tired of them.

We mobilized veteran artists, actors, and staff comrades to provide plays,排队 these plays, determined which ones to改 first and which ones to改 later, organized forces, and conducted整理 in groups. Generally, some plays that had not been performed for a long time, did not require major改动, and were easy to deal with were placed at the front. At the same time, some excellent plays that were more difficult to改 were also studied. Combined with the work of exploring plays, young actors were also cultivated, striving to inherit the performances of veteran artists. For example, "The Tale of Burning Incense" was a famous play of Zhou Mulin and Kang Zhilin. Since Kang's death, the complete play had not been performed for nearly twenty years. It was rare to see young female actors perform the "Farewell" and "Beating the Gods" scenes. The female lead, Jiao Guiying, had relatively demanding singing and acting skills, making it difficult to learn. Through the整理 and performance of this play, our院 already has two young female actors who are able to take on the performance, and the performing art of veteran artists has been inherited.

People who undervalue national heritage doubted our approach, saying that "搞traditional plays will lose money." In the院, many comrades were also concerned about whether 搞traditional plays would be popular, and their confidence was not high. Because at that time, many troupes were not able to attract audiences by performing traditional programs, and they were not as profitable as crudely made翻改 versions and条纲 versions. In order to eliminate these ideological obstacles, we studied the reasons why traditional plays did not sell well. The main reason was that various troupes did not perform traditional plays seriously and did not seriously carry out整理 and rehearsal work. When performing new plays, they would rehearse for half a month or a month, and the roles would also be selected and assigned; when performing traditional plays, they would put them together and perform them. The roles were incomplete, and they were "扯" on stage. Redundant scenes and unnecessary words were not校正, and even糟粕 was performed without modification. Audiences were unwilling to watch. Some plays that had been lost for a long time and were weighty were difficult to perform because many young actors had weak foundations and were afraid of hardship. They were unwilling to learn and take on the roles of such plays, believing that it was "费力不讨好," and they were all willing to take on programs that were easy to please. Therefore, the traditional programs performed by various troupes were mostly of poor quality and had low attendance rates.

川剧 "You Gui Ji" is a classic play that has been popular on stage for many years. Because it is generally performed "水"了, and even yellow performances have not been剔除, the audience does not welcome it, and some call it "有鬼记." "Dragon and Phoenix Sword" is a 川剧 Jianghu large-scale play. Because there are many曲牌, the acting is heavy, and it contains糟粕, it is not welcomed when it is moved out without modification, and the actors lack skills. These excellent traditional programs must be constantly improved in the actor's acting skills after整理 before they can be preserved on the stage.

We relied on veteran artists, mobilized all the comrades in the院, and resolutely implemented the work of exploring and整理traditional plays. From March 1955, after two months, we staged more than ten large-scale plays such as "Blood Handprint," "Qingping Sword," "Five Willow Garden," "You Gui Ji," "Huaiyin Ji," and "Chang Sheng Dian." These plays have undergone preliminary整理 and short rehearsals. In May, when performed in Xiaolongkan, Chongqing, it was able to perform large-scale plays for a month, and was welcomed by the audience, and the attendance rate increased from 40% to about 80%. Working-class comrades reflected that our院 performed seriously and solemnly, the roles were neat, everyone cooperated, and the spirit was full, and the repertoire was also rich. Thus, the view that "traditional programs do not sell well" was eliminated and confidence was established. By the beginning of 1956, "Gao Tang Zhou," "Jingyang Gang," "Flower Fairy," "Mu Guiying Breaks the Heavenly Gate Array," "Liang Hongyu Beats the Drums to Fight Jinshan," "Xiguan Du," "Burning Incense," "Pipa Ji" and others were performed successively; at the same time, we participated in the work of the Chongqing Office of the Sichuan Provincial Drama Identification Committee, and excavated and identified twenty plays; the phenomenon of the lack of plays to be staged in our院 was initially resolved, and the quality was also improved; middle-aged and young actors learned and inherited excellent performing techniques through the performance of these plays, and grew their skills, and further recognized the importance of inheriting traditional plays; intellectuals and cadres who participated in the modification further familiarized themselves with the opera heritage through cooperation with the artists, and strengthened the relationship with the artists; Some plays and performing techniques that have been lost for a long time have been initially accepted, providing us with a good foundation for future改编 and creation.

We encountered many difficulties in整理traditional plays. These must be resolved by relying on artists time and time again. Like the整理 of "Burning Incense," the first problem encountered was the "Lu Zi" (style) issue. One was the usual "水" style, and the other was the style of the famous Chengdu troupe Sanqinghui. There was a dispute over the choice of these two styles. We believed that the Sanqinghui version, after being改编 by Qing Zhao Xi, had a concise script, and after the long-term stage practice and creation of Kang Zhilin and Dean Zhou Mulin, the "Qing Tan" scene had become a famous 川剧 scene. In order to inherit Dean Zhou's performing art, it was decided to choose the Zhao Ben Lu Zi of Sanqinghui. Referring to relevant script materials,整理 was carried out. The biggest difficulty in整理 was that the styles of the "Beating the Gods" and "Qing Tan" scenes were not unified. "Beating the Gods" was based on Ming Wang Yufeng's version of "Mu Lian Zhuan" in Jin Ben's "Live Capture of Wang Kui," followed by "Yin Gao" and "Live Capture." If connected to "Qing Tan," it needed to be改动; however, some 川剧 actors and audiences did not agree to改动. Even among the actors in our院, there were disputes, with some advocating改 and some advocating not改. We processed it according to Dean Zhou Mulin's 改 opinion. As for the old "Beating the Gods," it is still preserved as another single scene for performance. There is also the question of whether Wang Kui's servant, Han Xing, is a positive character or a negative character. There have been disputes in整理 and performance for several years. We initially treated him as a positive character, but it was not until the巡回 performance in 1957 that he was changed to a villain. "Beating the Gods" also appropriately restored some old singing methods in this performance, and the final version has not yet been finalized. Disputes over a play cannot be resolved in a short period of time, nor can they be staged only after all the problems have been resolved. We have adopted the method of performing while改逐步解决. In terms of performance, the veteran artists of our院 still have different styles from Dean Zhou, and we have prepared to designate young actors to inherit them separately.

We often pay attention to the audience's requirements. When performing in Kunming in 1956, we learned that audiences not only like large-scale plays, but also many audiences like折子戏. We often pay attention to exploring and整理 some折子戏, and arrange the performance of some折子戏 in a planned way. Li Wenjie's "Drunk Li" and "Wen Wu Da," Qiong Lianfang and Jiang Shangfeng's "Fang Pei" and "Duan Qiao," Wang Qinglian and Yang Shaoan's "Killing Xi," and Dean Zhou Mulin's "Ci Tang," these折子戏 with high artistic attainments, are constantly磨练 and improved in the performance. At present, our院 has accumulated nearly two hundred excellent折子戏.

At the beginning of this year, the masses generally requested our院 to perform more comedies, which is precisely because we have performed more正戏 in the past and fewer comedies. We have actively enriched the comedy programs: we have performed some comedies from fraternal troupes, preliminarily整理 "Yi Zhong Yuan," and改编 "Butterfly Match" (now named "The Adventures of Lord Qiao"). Obviously, our work in this area is not enough, and we still need to explore and整理 more comedy programs to make our performances rich and colorful to meet the audience's requirements.

We have adopted a serious and prudent attitude in the work of exploring and整理 plays. First, we put the artist's oral scripts, copies, and performances on the stage. After watching them through the performance, we collect opinions for research. After having relatively mature整理 opinions, we再进行修改. 改急改快, 급히 성공을 추구하는 것은 종종 본질을 손상시켜 이후에 많은 문제를 야기합니다. 이것은 유산을 충분히 익히지 못하고 경솔하게 수정하는 결과입니다. 특히 오래전부터 전해져 내려온 명작은 역대 문인과 명배우의 가공을 거쳐 관객의 검증을 거쳤기 때문에 한두 번 본다고 다 익힐 수 없고, 한 번에 다 고칠 수도 없습니다. 따라서 장기적인 계획을 세우지 않을 수 없습니다. 파내서 정리하고 공연하고, 공연하고 정리하고, 반복적인 공연과 정리, 반복적인 연구와 수정을 거쳐 시대와 인민의 요구에 부합하고 완벽한 작품으로 발전시킨다. "어하교", "류음기"와 같이 정리된 작품은 여러 번의 수정을 거쳤습니다. 이번 수도에서 공연하는 "부노전"도 사천극목감정위원회 사무실과 사천극원 여러 차례의 가공을 거쳤으며, 순회공연에서도 끊임없이 정리하고 있으며, 현재도 많은 결점이 있으며, 공연실천에서 끊임없이 개선해야 합니다. 川剧 "비파기", "분향기"는 모두 원명 이래 유명한 고전 작품이며, 개편은 더욱 어렵습니다. "분향기"의 개편은 2년을 거쳤지만, 문예계와 관객의 논쟁이 많았지만, 계속 연구하고 점차 해결해야 합니다. "비파기"는 우리가 초보적인 정리만 하고 무대에 올리는 작업은 많은 노예술가, 명배우와 간부들의 노력을 거쳤습니다. 우리의 경험은 극 개편 작업은 예술가, 문예 간부, 사회 세력을 결집하여 공동으로 진행해야 하며, 한두 사람이 맡아서는 안 된다는 것입니다.

각 작품의 정리 속도와 가공 정도는 동일하게 요구할 수 없습니다. 상연 프로그램을 풍부하게 하고, 극단을 기업화 경영관리로 전환하기 위해서는 더 많고 질 좋은 상연 프로그램이 필요합니다. 따라서 더 많이 파내고 정리를 잘해야 합니다. 이 작업은 복잡하고 어렵습니다. 핵심 작품은 일반 상연 프로그램과 결합하고, 대작과 단막극을 결합하고, 발굴과 정리 개편을 결합하여 한쪽에 치우쳐서는 안 됩니다. 일반적으로 약간 정리하거나 당분간 정리하지 않고 공연하면서 공연하면서 정리 및 가공하는 이러한 작품은 우리의 보유 프로그램에서 수량 비중이 크다. "수유기", "백사전", "토끼전", "홍매각", "타홍대", "도은병", "서천도" 등; 어떤 작품은 정리 개편에 많은 노력을 들여 고쳐 관객이 좋아하는 프로그램이 되기도 한다. "교老爷奇遇", "芙奴传", "幽闺记", "槐荫记", "花仙" 등. 또한 힘은 많이 들지만, 단시간에 고치기 어려워 처음 공연한 후, 좌석 점유율이 높지 않은 작품도 있으며, 장기간에 걸쳐 반복적으로 정리하고 가공한 후 공연 실천에서 점차 높여야 광범위한 관객의 사랑을 받을 수 있다. "분향기", "비파기" 등과 같다. 비록 일시적으로 좌석 점유율이 높지 않더라도 열심히 정리하고 가공해야 합니다. 그렇지 않으면 계승할 수 없습니다. 이러한 작품은 대본 분량이 무겁고 문학 예술 수준이 높고, 오래전부터 전해져 내려와 민심에 깊이 박혀 있으며, 역대 천극 예술가들은 정교한 예술 창조를 해왔습니다. 국민당 통치가 민족 희곡을 파괴했기 때문에 대부분 10년, 20년 동안 공연하지 않았고, 청년 중년 배우들은 대부분 공연을 보지 못하거나 거의 보지 못했습니다. 일시적으로 계승하기는 어렵습니다. 대본을 정리하고 배우를 양성하는 데 있어 장기적인 관점에서 끊임없이 노력하고 큰 노동을 들여야 관객의 요구를 충족하고 좋은 효과를 거둘 수 있습니다. 우리 院에는 노예술가가 많으므로 우선 그들의 예술을 계승하여 보존하고, 무대 실천을 거쳐 끊임없이 정리하고 발전시켜 더욱 완전한 예술로 만들고, 이러한 우수한 전통 프로그램을 우리와 함께 사회주의 사회로 진입시킨다.

우리가 지난 몇 년 동안 극의 정리와 관행에 대해 가지고 있는 이러한 견해가 반드시 옳은 것은 아닙니다. 그러나 우리는 기꺼이 이야기하고 비판을 받기를 바랍니다. 우리는 예술 혁신 측면에서 과감하지 못하고, 창작극본에 대한 시도, 현실 반영 측면에 아직 시도하지 않았으며, 이 측면에 대한 접촉이 적고 아는 것이 적다는 것을 깊이 느낍니다. 앞으로 한편으로는 계속 전통극을 발굴하고 정리하고, 다른 한편으로는 예술 혁신과 창작 작업을 강화할 것입니다. 형제 극단 극단의 도움과 지도를 받을 수 있기를 바랍니다.

    整理川剧剧目的体会
    重庆市川剧院副院长　张民权
    编者按：去年重庆市川剧院在巡回演出中，演出了“芙奴传”“乔老爷奇遇”等优秀剧目。更早些时，成都市川剧团也以“谭记儿”“拉郎配”等戏受到观众的欢迎。其中有不少是久已失传或几十年来不演的剧目，它们使观众进一步认识到我国民族戏曲遗产和人民艺术创造力的丰富。近几年来，川剧艺术工作者在发掘和整理传统剧目的工作方面获得了显著的成绩。在工作中贯彻群众路线是他们的一条好经验。他们特别重视发动和团结老艺人、演员和职工一起来作发掘和整理的工作。在演出中，他们还不断地吸收群众意见进行修改。他们的经验是值得戏曲界重视的。
    我院遵照中央戏改政策，挖掘整理民族遗产的指示，几年来对传统剧目的挖掘整理，作了一些努力。1954年前，虽然作过一些试验，但是由于资本主义的经营观点，轻视传统剧目，对翻改和新编的剧本不讲质量，演一本抛一本，以致剧目贫乏，上座率不高，大大影响剧院的发展和艺人的生活。从1955年起，在重庆市委宣传部和市文化局的领导下，对资本主义经营观点进行了检查和批判，坚决贯彻挖掘整理传统剧目，丰富上演节目，提高演出质量的指示，对全体演职员进行了戏改政策的教育，发动老艺人和主要演员进行挖掘整理的工作。川剧剧目较多，选择节目是首要的步骤。我们研究了当时观众的要求，在工作上作了必要的改进。重庆市的观众，特别是工人观众，对我们上演节目的情况，是不满意的，观众批评我们不到一个星期就要“打重台”，反来复去总是演几个戏。观众要看一些富有斗争性的，人民性强烈的，有头有尾的，有男有女的，情节比较热闹的，爱憎分明的大幕戏。按照这个要求来检查，我们的演出节目中，就选不出几本较好的来。而且质量比较好的几本戏如“柳荫记”、“玉簪记”等，也演得太多，观众看厌了。
    我们发动老艺人、演员、职工同志们提供剧目，将这些剧目加以排队，定出哪些先改，哪些后改的计划，组织力量，分组进行整理。一般的是：先把一些久已不演，改动不大，轻而易举的，摆在前面。同时，也把一些较难改的优良剧目，进行研究。结合挖掘剧目的工作，对青年演员也进行培养，争取把老艺人的表演继承下来。如“焚香记”，是周慕莲、康芷林的名剧，自康死后，已近二十年未演全本，青年女角能演其中“誓别”、“打神”两折的很少见，女主角焦桂英在唱做方面都较重，学习较难，通过这个戏的整理演出，我院已有两个青年女演员能够担任演出，老艺人的表演艺术得以承继下来了。
    轻视民族遗产的人，怀疑我们这样作法，说“搞传统剧目要赔钱”；在剧院里也有许多同志顾虑搞传统剧目是否吃香，信心不大。因为当时确有不少剧团演出传统节目不上座；反不如粗制滥造的翻改本、条纲本卖钱。我们为了扫除这些思想障碍，研究了传统剧目为什么不卖钱的原因，主要是各剧团上演传统剧目不严肃，没有认真地进行整理和排练的工作。上演新戏就排演半个月或一个月，角色也经过选择调配；上演传统剧目是凑起来就演，角色有这行无那行，不整齐，在台上是“扯”的，冗场、水词亦不校正，甚至糟粕也原封不动的演出来，观众不愿看；有些失传较久、分量较重的剧目，因为许多青年演员的功底薄，怕吃苦，演起来很困难，不愿学习和担任这类剧目的角色，认为是“费力不讨好”，都愿担任容易讨好的节目。因而各剧团演出的传统节目，多是质量过差，上座率不高。
    川剧“幽闺记”是一个古典名剧，在舞台上流行了多年，因为一般都演“水”了，甚至黄色的表演亦未剔除，观众不欢迎，有的叫它“有鬼记”。“龙凤剑”是川剧江湖大本戏，因曲牌多，做工重，并包含糟粕，原封不动地搬出来，演员又缺乏功底，亦不受欢迎。这些优秀的传统节目，经过整理之后，还须不断地提高演员的演技，才能把它保留在舞台上。
    我们依靠老艺人，动员全院的同志们，坚决贯彻挖掘整理传统剧目的工作，从1955年3月起，经过两个月的时间，便上演了“血手印”、“青萍剑”、“五柳园”、“幽闺记”、“槐荫记”、“长生殿”等十多个大幕戏。这些戏都经过了初步的整理和短时的排练。5月在重庆小龙坎上演时，已能演一个月的大幕戏，受到观众的欢迎，上座率从四成提高到八成左右。工人同志们反映我院演出认真严肃，角色整齐，大家合作，精神饱满，剧目也丰富。从而打销了“传统节目不卖钱”的看法，树立了信心。及至1956年初，又陆续演出了“高唐州”、“景阳岗”、“花仙”、“穆桂英破天门阵”、“梁红玉击鼓战金山”、“西关渡”、“焚香记”、“琵琶记”等；同时我们参加了四川省剧目鉴定委员会重庆办公室的工作，挖掘并鉴定了二十个剧目；初步解决了我院上演剧目贫乏的现象，质量也有所提高；中年和青年演员通过这些剧目的演出，学习和继承了优秀表演技术，长了功夫，进一步认识到继承传统剧目的重要；参加修改的知识分子干部通过与艺人的合作，进一步熟悉了戏曲遗产，密切了与艺人合作的关系；有些久已失传的剧目和表演技术，初步接受下来，给我们今后改编和创作，提供了良好的基础。
    我们在整理传统剧目中，曾经遇到不少困难的。这必须一次一次依靠艺人来解决。如同“焚香记”的整理，首先遇到的就是“路子”问题，一是通常演出的“水”路子，一是成都著名班社三庆会的路子。对这两个路子的选择发生了争论。我们以为三庆会的本子，经过清赵熙的改编，剧本简练，又经康芷林和周慕莲院长长期舞台的实践和创造，其中“情探”一折，已成为川剧的名剧，为了继承周院长的表演艺术，决定选择三庆会的赵本路子。参考了有关剧本资料，进行整理。整理中的最大困难，是“打神”与“情探”两折的风格不够统一，“打神”是根据明王玉峰本演下来的，金本“目莲传”中的“活捉王魁”全本里的“打神”，下面接的是“阴告”和“活捉”，如与“情探”衔接，需要加以改动；但有一部分川剧演员和观众是不同意改动的，就在我院的演员中，也有争论，有的主张改，有的主张不改。我们是以周慕莲院长改的意见来加工的。至于老“打神”还是作为另一单折来保留演出。还有王魁的仆人韩兴是正面人物还是反面人物的问题，几年来在整理和演出中都有争论，我们先是处理为正面，至1957年巡回演出时，才改为反派。“打神”也在这次演出中才适当的恢复了一些老的唱法，至今还未定本。凡是一个戏的争论，不可能在短时间得到解决，也不可能等到把问题全部解决了之后才上演，我们采取了边演边改逐步解决的办法。“焚香记”在表演上，我院老艺人还有与周院长不同的路子，我们已准备指定青年演员分别的把它继承下来。
    我们经常注意观众的要求，1956年在昆明演出时，了解到观众不但喜爱大幕戏，同时也有不少观众喜爱折子戏。我们就经常注意挖掘整理一些折子戏，有计划地安排一些折子戏的演出，李文杰的“醉隶”、“文武打”，琼莲芳和姜尚峰的“放裴”、“断桥”，王清廉和杨少安的“杀惜”，周慕莲院长的“刺汤”，这些艺术造诣较高的折子戏，都是在演出中不断地磨练提高的。目前我院已积累了近二百个较优秀的折子戏。
    今年初，群众普遍要求我院多演喜剧，这正是因为我们过去演的正戏多，喜剧少。我们又积极丰富喜剧节目：演出了一些兄弟剧团的喜剧，初步整理了“意中缘”，改编了“蝴蝶媒”，（现名“乔老爷奇遇”）。显然，我们在这方面的工作做得是不够的，今后还须要多挖掘整理一些喜剧节目，使我们的演出丰富多彩，以满足观众的要求。
    我们在挖掘整理剧目的工作上，采取了严肃慎重的态度。先把艺人的口述本、抄本和表演搬上舞台，通过演出，看了之后，收集意见进行研究，有了比较成熟的整理意见，再进行修改。改急改快，急于求成，往往容易损伤精华的部分，给以后带来了很多的麻烦。这是对遗产还不够熟悉，就轻率的进行修改的结果。特别是流传久远的名剧，经过了历代文人和名演员的加工，经过观众的考验，不可能看一两次就全部熟悉它，更不可能一下子就改好；这就不能不使我们树立长期打算的思想。挖出来再整理演出，演出了再整理，经过反复的演出整理，反复的研究修改，使它合乎时代和人民的要求，发展为完美的剧目。川剧整理得比较好的剧本，如“御河桥”、“柳荫记”，都是经过许多次的修改；这次我们在首都演出的“芙奴传”，也是经过川剧剧目鉴定委员会办公室、四川省川剧院若干次的加工，我们在旅行演出中也不断的进行整理，现在还存在许多缺点，有待于在演出实践中不断的改进。 川剧“琵琶记”、“焚香记”都是元明以来的著名古典剧目，整理改编就更感困难。“焚香记”的改编，虽然也经过了两年，文艺界和观众也有不少的争论，也须继续研究，逐步的解决。“琵琶记”，我们只是作了初步整理，搬上舞台的工作，都是经过了许多老艺人、名演员和干部的劳力。我们的经验：戏改工作必须团结艺人、文艺干部、以至社会力量共同来搞，想一两个人包下来是搞不好的。
    对每个剧目整理的快慢，和加工的多少，要求是不能一致。为了丰富上演节目，剧院走向企业化经营管理，需要更多的、质量较好的上演节目，这就需要挖得多，整理得好；这一工作是复杂的，艰巨的。重点剧目要与一般演出剧目相结合，大戏与折子戏相结合，挖掘与整理改编相结合，不能顾此失彼。一般的是稍加整理或暂不整理就演出，边演边整理加工，这类剧目在我们的保留节目中数量比重较大，如：“绣襦记”、“白蛇传”、“白兔记”、“红梅阁”、“打红台”、“盗银瓶”、“西川图”等；有些剧目在整理改编上，花费的力量较大，改动加工较多，成为观众喜爱的节目的如：“乔老爷奇遇”、“芙奴传”、“幽闺记”、“槐荫记”、“花仙”等。也有一些节目费力很大，短时间内难于改好，初次上演后，上座率并不高，必须经过长时的反复整理加工，再从演出实践中逐步提高，才能获得广大观众的热爱，如同“焚香记”、“琵琶记”等。虽然一时上座率不高，但也必须努力整理加工，否则就继承不下来了。这类剧目是剧本分量重，文学艺术水平高，流传久远，深入民心，历代的川剧艺术家们，都有过精湛的艺术创造。由于国民党统治对民族戏曲的摧残，多是十年、二十年不演了，青年中年演员大都是没有见过演过或是少于见过演过的节目，一时继承下来是有困难的。无论在整理剧本和培养演员上，都须从长远着眼，经常不断的努力，花费较大的劳动，才能达到观众的要求，收到良好的效果。我院老艺人较多，首先把他们的艺术继承保留下来，经过舞台的实践，不断的整理，发展为更完整的艺术，使这些优秀的传统节目，和我们一道进入社会主义社会。
    我们几年来对待整理剧目的这些看法和做法，未必然是对的；但是我们很愿意谈出来，希望得到批评。我们深深感到在艺术革新方面不够大胆，对创作剧本，反映现实方面还没有尝试，对这一方面问题接触少，知道的更少。今后一方面继续挖掘整理传统剧目；一方面要加强艺术革新和创作的工作，希望能得到兄弟剧种剧团的帮助和指导。
