    Motor Vehicles and Trucks Travel Freely in the Changbai Mountain Area
    Of the 909 townships in the Changbai Mountain area, all but 17 are now accessible to motor vehicles and trucks. The mountain truck roads are closely connected to the forest industrial narrow-gauge railways, extending like blood vessels into the dense, forest-covered areas. From Antu, one can take a car towards the 2,700-meter-high summit of Changbai Mountain, traversing layer upon layer of forests, reaching the Erdaobaihe Township, which is 140 li from Tianchi (Heavenly Lake).
    Due to the development of transportation, the cargo tonnage in the Changbai Mountain area has doubled in the past five years. The area's abundant specialties, such as wild grapes, acorns, and various medicinal materials, are now being transported out in large quantities. Some agricultural cooperatives have begun to use new agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers.

    汽车大车畅行长白山区
    长白山区的九百零九个乡镇中，除了十七个乡镇外，目前汽车和大车都可以畅行无阻。山区的大车路紧连着森林工业小铁路，像血管一样伸进遮天的密林。从安图坐上汽车向海拔二千七百公尺的长白山顶峰奔驰，越过重重森林，可以一直达到距离天池一百四十里的二道白河乡。
    由于交通事业的发展，长白山区近五年来的货运吨数增长一倍。山区丰饶的特产如山葡萄、橡子和各种药材，现在已经大量外运。有些农业社已开始使用新式农具和化学肥料。
