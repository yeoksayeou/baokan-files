Guangzhou Building Steel Plant

(Our dispatch) Guangzhou’s first modern integrated iron and steel plant, the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant, has begun construction, and the main plant building will also officially begin construction this month. After the plant is completed, it will produce more than 140,000 tons of pig iron annually; other steel and coke production will also be considerable. The entire plant construction project will be carried out in two phases. The first phase is expected to be completed and put into production by the end of this year, with an annual output of 47,000 tons of pig iron, 40,000 tons of rolled steel, and 55,000 tons of coke. The completion and commissioning of this plant will strongly support the development of industrial and agricultural production in Guangdong Province.

This plant is being built in Donglang, a suburb of the city. In the past, during the reactionary rule of Chen Jitang, there were also boasts about building a steel plant there, and the American McKee Company was invited to prepare for its construction. However, after more than three years of preparation, it was still just empty talk.

The Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant is designed by the Central Iron and Steel Design Institute, and the machinery and equipment are supplied by domestic machine manufacturing factories.

The raw materials and fuel used by the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant will be sourced locally, utilizing the abundant resources of Guangdong.

    广州兴建钢铁厂
    本报讯　广州的第一座现代化钢铁联合工厂——广州钢铁厂已经动工兴建了，主厂房工程也将在本月内正式施工。这个厂建成后将年产生铁十四万吨以上；其他钢材、焦炭的产量也不少。全部建厂工程分两期进行，第一期工程预计在今年底完工并投入生产，年产生铁四万七千吨、轧制钢材四万吨、焦炭五万五千吨。这个工厂的建成和投入生产，将有力地支援广东省工农业生产的发展。
    这个厂建在市郊东塱。过去，陈济棠反动统治时期，也曾吹嘘要在那里建设一座钢铁厂，并请美国的麦基公司筹建，但是筹建了三年多，还只是纸上谈兵而已。
    广州钢铁厂由中央黑色冶金设计总院设计，由国内机器制造工厂供应机械设备。
    广州钢铁厂所用的原料、燃料等，将就地取材，利用广东地区的丰富资源。
