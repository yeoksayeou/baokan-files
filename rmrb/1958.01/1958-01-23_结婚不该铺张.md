    Weddings Should Not Be Extravagant
    I feel that the extravagant and wasteful phenomena in young people's weddings are becoming more and more serious.
    Now, young cadres in government agencies spend at least one or two hundred yuan on getting married. The general situation is that the sheets and quilts on the bed must be brand new, and even the pillowcases must be new. A few comrades also buy expensive decorations such as gold necklaces, gemstone brooches, and gold rings when they get married. Last spring, a member of the Publishing House of our ministry spent more than 50 yuan on photography alone.
    The custom of "giving gifts" to comrades who are getting married is also becoming more and more prevalent. I remember in 1954, only a few of the closest comrades and relatives gave gifts. Some spent a dime to buy a picture and write a few congratulatory words, which was considered a pretty good gift. Now it is very different. When one person gets married, almost all the comrades in the unit have to give gifts, usually two or three yuan each. It seems that whoever does not contribute will lose face. Everyone gives gifts, and the gifts are often repeated. Some people receive two thermos bottles, three sets of tea sets, and more than a dozen picture frames at the same time... These things are not only impossible to display in the new house, but also unnecessary.
    This kind of atmosphere is very bad. It is incompatible with the spirit of diligence and thrift in building socialism advocated by our Party. We should reverse this phenomenon.

    结婚不该铺张
    我感到青年们在结婚中的铺张浪费现象愈来愈严重了。
    现在机关青年干部结婚，最低也要花上一、二百元。一般情况是：床上铺的、盖的都得更换一新，连枕头心也得是新的；有少数同志结婚时还买贵重装饰品，如金项链、宝石别针、金戒指等。我部出版社某团员去年春天结婚时，仅照像一项开支就是五十多元。
    给结婚的同志“送礼”的风气也愈来愈盛行了。记得1954年的时候，还只是少数关系最密切的同志及亲戚之间送点礼物，有的花一角钱买一张画，写上几句贺词，也算是挺好的礼品。现在却大不相同了。一人结婚，本单位几乎全体同志都要送礼，一般都是拿二元、三元的，谁不出一份钱，面子上就有些过不去似的。大家都送礼，礼品也往往重复，有的人同时收到两个热水瓶、三套茶具、十多个镜框……等，这些东西不仅在新房里没处陈设，而且也用不着。
    这种风气很不好，它和我们党提倡的克勤克俭、建设社会主义的精神是水火不能相容。我们应该扭转这种现象。
