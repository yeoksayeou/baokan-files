Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 11th: According to TASS, Moscow, January 11th, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, wrote letters to the Prime Ministers of France, Gaillard; the Federal Republic of Germany, Adenauer; and Italy, Zoli, proposing a meeting of leaders from Eastern and Western countries.

These letters were delivered by the Soviet ambassadors to France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Italy, respectively. Attached to each letter was a document entitled "Suggestions of the Soviet Government on the Issue of Easing International Tension."

Bulganin's letter to Gaillard pointed out that the Soviet Union proposed holding a high-level meeting of national leaders within the next two to three months. To ensure the smooth progress of such a meeting, it should not be complicated by issues on which the parties still have irreconcilable differences. On the contrary, attention should be focused on discussing and concentrating on issues that can be resolved at the meeting. The letter listed these issues and pointed out their direct relevance to France.

The letter continued, "We are pleased to note that the French government is exploring the possibility of organizing a meeting between representatives of Eastern and Western countries. Mr. Prime Minister, in a recent conversation, you expressed your approval of holding a summit conference of heads of government, while also raising a reservation that foreign ministers should meet before this conference is convened. It is evident that we share a certain consensus on the necessity of holding a summit conference of heads of government. At the same time, it appears we have different understandings of the method of preparing for this conference. The Soviet Union advocates starting directly with high-level talks attended by heads of government, rather than beginning with a meeting of foreign ministers."

The letter pointed out that the Soviet government does not exclude entrusting foreign ministers with further research and concretization of the resolutions passed by the high-level meeting.

The letter concluded by expressing hope that the French government would also take corresponding steps to enable the high-level meeting of heads of government to be convened soon.

In his letter to the Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany, Adenauer, Bulganin pointed out that many of the issues to be submitted to the high-level meeting of national leaders for study, according to the Soviet proposal, are directly related to the Federal Republic of Germany.

When discussing the issue of German reunification, Bulganin pointed out that if the use of force is abandoned, then the only way to solve the national task of the German people is for the two Germanys to reach an agreement based on the recognition and full consideration of their interests. Under these conditions, there is no other way to unify Germany except through the mutual approach of the two Germanys and the establishment of a German confederation.

The letter said that reaching an agreement on the issues provided by the Soviet government for discussion at the leaders' meeting would greatly promote the resolution of the German problem.

Bulganin concluded by expressing hope that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany would attach importance to the proposal requesting its participation in the meeting of national leaders and that it would not, under any circumstances, remain outside the meeting.

In his letter to the Prime Minister of Italy, Zoli, Bulganin pointed out that politicians and social figures in Italy and many other countries are interested in the measures proposed by the Soviet government to ease international tension. The public firmly demands that Eastern and Western leaders reach an agreement on ending the arms race and eliminating the "Cold War."

In his letter, Bulganin said that the Italian government actively supported the American plan for further military expansion at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting held in December. This attitude of the Italian government has naturally caused us great concern.

Bulganin wrote that the governments of certain European countries have already supported the proposal to convene a high-level meeting. Just recently, French Prime Minister Gaillard expressed his agreement to hold such a meeting. However, it is surprising that Italian government officials have expressed a negative attitude towards Gaillard's remarks. Italian government officials oppose holding a high-level meeting and believe that only a meeting of foreign ministers is possible.

Bulganin said that the Soviet government does not oppose convening a meeting of foreign ministers to further study the resolutions passed by the high-level meeting and to concretize these resolutions.

Bulganin concluded by saying that the Soviet government expects the Italian government to give very serious consideration to the issues raised by the Soviet government.

    布尔加宁写信给法意和西德总理
    呼吁三国促成首脑会议早日召开
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科11日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁分别写信给法国总理盖伊阿、德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳和意大利总理佐利，向他们提出了东西方各国领导人举行高级会谈的建议。
    这些信是分别由苏联驻法国、德意志联邦共和国和意大利的大使转交的。信内都附有“苏联政府关于缓和国际紧张局势问题的建议”。
    布尔加宁给盖伊阿的信指出，苏联建议在最近两三个月内召开各国领导人的高级会议。为了使这样的会议得以顺利进行，不要用各方目前还存在的难望解决的意见分歧的问题来使会议的工作复杂化。与此相反，应该加以讨论并集中注意的是在会议中可能解决的问题。信中列举了这些问题，并且指出了这些问题的解决对法国的切身利害关系。
    这封信接着说，我们满意地指出，法国政府正在探求组织东西方国家代表会晤的可能性。总理先生，您在不久前的一次谈话中表示赞同召开各国政府首脑会议，当然您也提出了一个保留，即在召开这次会议之前，各国外交部长应该进行会晤。可见我们之间，实质上对必须召开各国政府首脑会议的看法存在着某种一致。同时看来我们对筹备这次会议的方法有着不同的理解。苏联主张不从各国外长会议开始，而是直接从有各国政府首脑参加的高级会谈开始。
    信中指出，苏联政府并不排斥把高级会议通过的决议委托各国外长作进一步研究和使这些决议具体化。
    信中最后表示，希望法国政府也能采取相应的步骤，以便使各国政府首脑的高级会议能够在最近召开。
    布尔加宁在给德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳的信中指出，根据苏联的建议，将提交各国领导人高级会议研究的许多问题同德意志联邦共和国有直接关系。
    布尔加宁在谈到德国统一问题的时候指出，如果摒弃使用武力，那么解决德国人民全民族任务的唯一道路就是两个德国在承认和全面照顾它们利益的基础上取得协议。在这种条件下，除了两个德国互相接近和建立德意志邦联以外，没有其他统一德国的办法。
    信中说，就苏联政府提供各国领导人会议讨论的那些问题达成协议，会大大促进德国问题的解决。
    布尔加宁最后表示，希望德意志联邦共和国政府重视要求它参加各国领导人会议的建议，希望它无论如何不要置身于会议之外。
    布尔加宁在给意大利总理佐利的信中指出，意大利以及其他许多国家的政界人士和社会人士对苏联政府提出的缓和国际紧张局势的措施感到兴趣。公众坚决要求东西方领导人就停止军备竞赛和消除“冷战”达成协议。
    布尔加宁在信中说，意大利政府在12月举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议上曾经积极支持美国的进一步扩充军备的计划。意大利政府的这种态度当然引起了我们很大的忧虑。
    布尔加宁写道，某些欧洲国家的政府已经支持召开高级会议的主张。就在不久以前，法国总理盖伊阿曾经表示同意召开这种会议。然而意大利政府人士对盖伊阿的谈话表示了否定的态度，这令人感到奇怪。意大利政府人士反对举行高级会议而认为只有举行外长会议的可能。
    布尔加宁说，苏联政府不反对召开外长会议来进一步研究高级会议通过的决议以及使这些决议具体化。
    布尔加宁最后说，苏联政府期待意大利政府十分认真地考虑苏联政府所提出的问题。
