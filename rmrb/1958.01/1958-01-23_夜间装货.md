Loading Cargo at Night

Late at night, snowflakes fluttered in the air, with only scattered lights on the ship and the dock. The biting cold wind swept into the harbor, truly making people feel uncomfortable. The tall belt conveyor continuously poured coal dust into the hatch, and the small trains on the dock chugged back and forth busily.

Business Chief Zhu Qing, wearing a cotton coat, walked back and forth on the deck. He would stop from time to time, his eyes fixed on the coal-carrying train on the dock, his mind preoccupied with only one question: how could they load the coal ahead of schedule?

The captain had said when the ship arrived at the port that if they could set sail from Qinhuangdao two hours early, they could overfulfill their transportation task for the month by 35%! This meant they had to load the coal by four o'clock tomorrow morning.

In the cold night, the clock struck twelve. The workers on the first shift finished their work, but Zhu Qing was still guarding the hatch on the deck. The belt conveyor and the crane kept turning endlessly, and the north wind carried coal dust into everyone's faces, making it almost impossible to open their eyes. Zhu Qing hadn't had a good rest for five nights. The workers advised him to take a break, but he always said he didn't need to. The workers had no choice and said, "You go and rest, we guarantee to load the coal two hours ahead of schedule." Zhu Qing didn't say anything. He walked to each hatch to take a look, then went back to his room. Without bothering to take off his coat, he fell on the bed. In the blink of an eye, someone came to shout: "The crane is broken!" Zhu Qing jumped up and ran to find the engineer to repair the machine. Coincidentally, the motor of the belt conveyor also had a small problem. Zhu Qing hurriedly ran to the dock to call an electrician to repair the motor. He was truly running around in circles. He kept busy until four o'clock in the morning, and the workers also finished loading the coal. Zhu Qing and the workers smiled as they watched the ship slowly leave the dock.

    夜间装货
    深夜，空中雪花纷飞，只有船上和码头上点点灯光，凛冽的寒风向港内袭来，着实令人难过。高大的皮带运输机，源源不断的把煤末泻入舱口，码头上小火车，呼哧呼哧来回奔忙。
    业务长朱庆身穿棉大衣，在甲板上来回走动，他时而停住，眼里望着码头上运煤的火车，脑子里只盘算一个问题，怎样能提前把煤装好。
    船到港那天船长说过，假若我们能在秦皇岛提前两小时开航，那么这个月我们可以超额完成35％的运输任务！也就是说必需在明晨四点钟把煤装好。
    寒冷的夜，时钟敲过十二响，上半夜的工人下班了，朱庆还在甲板上守着舱口，皮带运输机吊货机无休止的转动，北风夹着煤灰向各人脸上扑来，简直睁不开眼。朱庆有五夜没好好休息过，工人劝他去休息一会，他总说不需要。工人没有办法，说你尽管去休息，我们保证提前两小时把煤装好。朱庆没有说话，又走到各舱口看看，随后走回房间，没顾得脱掉大衣就倒在床上，一眨眼工夫，有人来喊：吊货机坏啦！朱庆一跃起来，跑去找轮机员修理机器，说也凑巧，皮带运输机的马达也出了点小毛病，朱庆急忙跑到码头上打电话喊电工修理马达，真是忙得团团转，一直忙到早晨四点钟，工人也把煤装完了，朱庆和工人们望着徐徐离开码头的轮船微笑了。
