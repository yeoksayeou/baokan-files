    Jottings
    Self-Isolation
    Franco told the Spanish people in his New Year's message: "If war breaks out, it will not be limited. ... Future wars will certainly destroy life in large areas of the world." From this, he drew a conclusion: in the current state of the world, there is no place for "self-isolation."
    What is the actual meaning of opposing "self-isolation"? According to Western news agencies, Dulles, after the Paris Conference, rushed to Madrid to negotiate with Franco on the issue of establishing missile bases in Spain, and the Spanish government has made a guarantee to strengthen its "military contribution" to the "free world."
    Franco pointed out the dangers of war to the Spanish people, but under the guise of opposing "self-isolation," he wanted them to seek destruction. Franco's actions will inevitably only make him more "self-isolated" among the Spanish people.
    Empty Promises
    Kishi Nobusuke's New Year's "aspirations" included continuing efforts to recover Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands. But behind these grand words was a tail: that it must wait for the international situation to improve.
    The U.S. occupation of Okinawa is one of the root causes of the tense situation in the Far East. How can one expect the tense situation in the Far East to improve if the U.S. military does not withdraw from Okinawa and continues to build missile bases there? It turns out this is just another empty promise from Kishi Nobusuke!
    Paying to Suffer
    According to the Paris weekly "International Forum," the implementation of the U.S. plan to establish intermediate-range missile bases in Europe will require the West European member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to pay 7.5 trillion francs. This amount is 2.2 trillion francs more than the total French budget expenditure for the entire year of 1958.
    Forcing Western European countries to accept missile bases is the main content of the "mutual dependence" policy peddled by the U.S. and Britain at the Paris Conference. Some people actually intend to pay such an expensive "dependence" fee, solely for the purpose of sharing the fate of "common destruction" when the United States launches a war of aggression! This is truly "paying to suffer."

    自我孤立
    佛朗哥在新年文告里告诉西班牙人民说：“如果战争爆发的话，它是不会有限度的。……今后的战争肯定会把世界很大地区内的生命毁灭掉。”他由此得出了一个结论：在世界的目前情况下“自我孤立”是没有地位的。
    反对“自我孤立”的实际含义是什么呢？据西方通讯社透露，杜勒斯在巴黎会议结束后，匆匆赶到马德里去和佛朗哥谈判在西班牙建立导弹基地的问题，而西班牙政府已作了要加强对“自由世界”的“军事贡献”的保证。
    佛朗哥向西班牙人民指出了战争的危险性，却在反对“自我孤立”的幌子下要他们去找毁灭作伴。佛朗哥这样做，必然只能使他在西班牙人民当中更加“自我孤立”。
    空头支票
    岸信介新春谈“抱负”，有一条是说他要继续努力，以期收复冲绳岛和小笠原群岛。但在这种豪言壮语后面，却拖了一条尾巴，即必须等待国际局势得到改善。
    美国对冲绳岛的霸占，正是造成远东紧张局势的根源之一。美军不退出冲绳，而且还在大肆修筑导弹基地，怎么能够指望远东紧张局势得到改善呢？原来，这又是岸信介的一纸空头支票！
    贴钱找罪受
    据巴黎“国际论坛”周刊估计，要执行美国在欧洲设立中程导弹基地的计划，北大西洋集团西欧各成员国必须支付七万五千亿法郎。这笔费用比法国1958年全年的预算支出总额还要多二万二千亿法郎。
    强迫西欧各国接受导弹基地，是美英在巴黎会议上兜售的“互相依赖”政策的主要内容。竟有人打算支付一笔这样昂贵的“依赖”费，目的仅仅为了在美国发动侵略战争时分担“共同毁灭”的命运！这真叫“贴钱找罪受”。
