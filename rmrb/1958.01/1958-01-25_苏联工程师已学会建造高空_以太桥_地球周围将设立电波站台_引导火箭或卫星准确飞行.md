Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 24th: Soviet scientist Pokrovsky stated in a recent issue of "Youth Technology" magazine that Soviet scientists and designers have learned to build "ether bridges" reaching hundreds of kilometers in altitude. It is foreseeable that within this century, mankind will first establish many cosmic platforms, cosmic stations, crossroads, ether bridges, and other cosmic "structures" fixed in one position in the cosmic space around the Earth, and then within the solar system. The main materials of these "structures" are electromagnetic fields and electromagnetic waves.

Professor Pokrovsky, when discussing how to achieve accuracy in aiming intercontinental ballistic rockets and how to guide artificial satellites into orbit, said that intercontinental rockets consisting of three or several stages of engines should first be installed vertically on the launch site. The last stage of the rocket can fly to an altitude of more than 1,000 kilometers above the ground and reach the predetermined area very accurately. In order for the last stage rocket to reach the predetermined area and have a hit deviation of no more than ten kilometers, it must be guided accurately along a so-called directional aiming "pipeline" that is hundreds of kilometers long. This "pipeline" is composed of radio waves emitted by several radio stations.

Three or four radio stations emit directional radio waves behind the rocket, and these radio waves form a kind of narrow "pipeline" along which the rocket speeds. When the rocket deviates slightly, it will enter an area where the intensity of the radio waves is greater than in the center of the "pipeline." At that time, the radio waves act on the automatically controlled instruments, and the rocket immediately returns to the center of the "pipeline."

When talking about how to guide artificial satellites into a predetermined orbit, the Soviet scientist said that the rocket carrying the satellite speeds horizontally. It is controlled and oriented by a radio station system on Earth. The rays of the directional radio waves rotate with the movement of the rocket and cause it to fly along a predetermined route, thus creating a special ether "structure" that is constantly moving. When humans can realize space flight, they will begin to build many so-called fixed electromagnetic force "structures" and many ether "machines" that can complete complex and rapid movements in the cosmic space around the Earth.

    苏联工程师已学会建造高空“以太桥”
    地球周围将设立电波站台  引导火箭或卫星准确飞行
    据新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学家波克罗夫斯基在最近一期“青年技术”杂志上发表文章说，苏联科学家和设计师已经学会了建造高达数百公里的“以太桥”。可以预料，就在我们这个世纪里，人类将首先在地球周围的宇宙空间，然后在太阳系的范围里建立许多用以太造成的宇宙台、宇宙站、交叉路、以太桥和其他固定在一个地位的宇宙“建筑物”。这些“建筑物”的主要材料是电磁场和电磁波。
    波克罗夫斯基教授在谈到如何使洲际弹道火箭的瞄准达到准确程度和如何把人造卫星引向轨道的问题时说，先将由三级或者若干级发动机组成的洲际火箭垂直地安装在发射场上。最后一级火箭可以飞到离地面一千多公里的高空，并且十分准确地到达预定地区。为了使最后一级火箭能够到达预定地区，并且命中偏差不超过十公里，必须引导它准确地沿着一个长达数百公里的所谓定向瞄准“管道”前进。这种“管道”是由若干个无线电站所发出的电波构成的。
    三个或者四个无线电站在火箭后面发出定向无线电波，这些电波构成某种狭窄的“管道”，火箭就沿着它飞驰。当火箭稍微有些偏斜时，它就会进入无线电波的强度比“管道”中央更大的区域。那时，电波作用于自动操纵的仪器，火箭就立刻重新回到“管道”中央。
    这位苏联科学家在谈到如何把人造卫星引向预定轨道时说，携带卫星的火箭沿着水平方向疾驰。它是由地球上的无线电站系统操纵和定向的。定向无线电波的射线随着火箭的运动而旋转，并且使它沿着预定的路线飞行，这样就造成一种不断运动着的特殊的以太“建筑物”。等到人能实现宇宙飞行时，人们就开始在地球周围的宇宙空间建造许多所谓固定的电磁力“建筑物”和许多可以完成复杂而迅速的运动的以太“机器”。
