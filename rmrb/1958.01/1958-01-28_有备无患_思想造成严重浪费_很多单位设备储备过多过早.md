The People's Construction Bank of China has discovered in its supervision of the use of basic construction appropriations that many units currently have excessive and premature equipment reserves, which is very detrimental to capital turnover.

According to an analysis of relevant data from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry of Building Materials Industry conducted by the People's Construction Bank of China last year, as well as inspections of some construction units under their jurisdiction, it was found that during the First Five-Year Plan period, the year-end equipment reserves of these three ministries generally amounted to more than half of the total equipment investment for the following year. In some construction units, it even amounted to one or two times the total equipment investment for the following year. This means that the equipment needed for the current year was generally reserved six months, one year, or even two years in advance. The reserve period for individual equipment was as long as four or five years.

According to relevant officials from the People's Construction Bank of China, other ministries have similar situations.

Excessive and premature equipment reserves prevent a large amount of capital from fully realizing its investment effectiveness. The aforementioned three ministries have had considerable surplus funds each year, while the funds occupied by the stockpiled equipment account for an average of 74.5%, with a maximum of 82%. In Jilin, the funds occupied by a factory's equipment reserves in 1955 were equivalent to 136% of its equipment investment for that year. The value of the equipment stockpiled by Anshan Iron and Steel in 1956 was more than 166.6 million yuan, but only 20% could be used in 1957, with the remaining 80% to be used after 1958 or even 1960. The funds occupied by this 80% of equipment could build three or four textile factories with 100,000 spindles each, or eleven mechanized small rolling steel workshops.

Excessive and premature equipment reserves also increase management costs. For example, according to the current actual equipment installation volume, a factory in Harbin only needs a warehouse with an area of 120,000 square meters to store equipment. However, due to excessive equipment reserves, a warehouse was built in 1953, and another was built in 1954, costing an additional five to six million yuan. The number of equipment management personnel also nearly doubled, with wage expenses alone amounting to tens of thousands of yuan each year.

The reasons for this situation, in addition to objective factors such as late planning and design, frequent changes, delayed or suspended projects, and the difficulty in controlling the timing of foreign orders which necessitate early ordering, are mainly due to the fact that many units do not pay attention to careful calculation and have such thoughts as "better early than late," "better more than less," and "better safe than sorry." Many units blindly place orders before the tasks have been determined, or even if they have been initially determined, there is no reliable basis for ordering. For example, the expansion task of the Yongdeng Cement Plant had not been determined, but the equipment had already arrived, accumulating more than 800,000 yuan of funds. The electric welding machines needed for the first phase of the project only needed to arrive before production started in 1957, but they were purchased as early as 1955 and left in the warehouse for two years. In Taiyuan, a factory spent more than 270,000 yuan to buy a lot of instruments before the task was determined and the civil engineering work had even started. Some units, in order to be "better safe than sorry," also rushed to purchase and store equipment that they did not need or did not need for the time being. For example, among the equipment in stock at Anshan Iron and Steel in 1956, equipment worth more than 4.6 million yuan had been accumulated over the years. These equipments were not on any plan but were kept in the warehouse under the name of "reserve equipment". Some units also rushed to purchase equipment that they did not need as "capital" in order to exchange it with others for the equipment they needed. The departments in charge did not closely supervise the disposal of stockpiled equipment by their subordinate units, the equipment reserve quotas were not strictly controlled, and the Construction Bank's supervision was insufficient, all of which had a certain impact on causing excessive and premature equipment reserves.

Currently, the People's Construction Bank of China is preparing to study and solve this problem with relevant departments.

### “有备无患”思想造成严重浪费  很多单位设备储备过多过早

    “有备无患”思想造成严重浪费
    很多单位设备储备过多过早
    本报讯　中国人民建设银行在监督基本建设拨款使用情况中发现，目前很多单位设备储备过多过早，对资金周转十分不利。
    根据中国人民建设银行去年对冶金工业部、化学工业部、建筑材料工业部三个部有关资料进行分析和对所属部分建设单位进行检查的结果，发现这三个部在第一个五年计划期间，历年年终结存的设备一般都相当于次年设备总投资的一半以上，有的建设单位甚至相当于次年设备总投资的一倍或两倍。这就是说，当年需要的设备，一般都在半年、一年以前或两年以前就储备下了。个别的设备储备期还有长达四、五年的。
    据中国人民建设银行有关负责同志谈，其他部也有类似情况。
    由于设备储备过多过早，使大量资金不能充分发挥投资效果。上述三个部历年来每年都有不少结余资金，而结存的设备占用的资金，平均占74.5％，最高占82％。吉林有个厂1955年结存设备占用的资金相当于当年设备投资的136％。鞍钢1956年结存的设备价值一亿六千六百多万元，1957年只能用20％，其余80％要在1958年以后甚至1960年才能用上。这80％的设备占用的资金，可建三、四个十万纱锭的纺织厂，或十一个机械化的小型轧钢车间。
    设备储备过多过早，还要增加管理费用。如哈尔滨某厂按目前实际设备安装量，只要一个面积十二万平方公尺的仓库储存设备就行了，但是由于设备储备得过多，1953年修了一个仓库，1954年又修了一座，多花了五、六百万元。设备管理人员也因此增加了将近一倍，仅工资开支每年就有数万元。
    造成这种情况，除计划、设计确定晚，变动多，或工程缓建、停建，以及国外订货时间不易掌握必须早订等客观原因外，主要是由于许多单位不注意精打细算，存在宁早勿晚、宁多勿少、有备无患等思想。不少单位在任务还没有确定，或者虽然初步确定，但还没有可靠的订货依据以前就盲目订货。如永登水泥厂扩建任务还没有确定，设备就到货了，积压了八十多万元的资金。这个厂第一期工程需要的电焊机，只要在1957年投入生产前到货就可以，但他们竟在1955年就买来了，在仓库里放了两年。太原有个工厂任务还没有确定，土建工程还没有动工，就花了二十七万多元买来很多仪表。有的单位为了“有备无患”，把自己并不需要或暂时并不需要的设备也抢购储存起来。如鞍钢1956年的库存设备中有价值四百六十多万元的设备是历年滚存下来的。这些设备计划上没有，但也一直放在仓库里，美其名曰“保留设备”。还有一些单位把自己并不需要的设备抢购去作为“资本”，以便和别人交换自己所需要的设备。而主管部门对所属单位处理积压设备督促不紧，设备储备定额控制不严，建设银行监督不够等，也都对造成设备储备过多过早有一定影响。
    目前，中国人民建设银行正准备同有关部门研究解决这一问题。
