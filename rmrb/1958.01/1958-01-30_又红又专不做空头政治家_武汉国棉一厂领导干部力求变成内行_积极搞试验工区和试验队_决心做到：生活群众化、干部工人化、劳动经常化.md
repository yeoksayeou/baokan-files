Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 29th: The responsible cadres of the Party and government of the state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory are learning from the method of rural leading cadres planting experimental plots, actively engaging in experimental work zones and experimental teams, and are determined to train themselves into cadres who are both Red and expert.

These responsible cadres have already begun, starting last week, to spend two to three and a half days each week learning production and participating in production. They have already signed and are in the process of signing apprenticeship contracts with workers, and have also formulated individual plans for learning technology; some responsible cadres have even bought cloth and made work clothes themselves.

The practice of leading cadres of the No. 1 Cotton Mill engaging in experimental work zones and experimental teams in the factory is a step deeper than the general "one-dragon" working method of spinning mills. The "one-dragon" working method mainly involves leading cadres and technical personnel going deep into certain work zones and work sections to provide work guidance, but they do not participate in production; while the practice of experimental work zones and experimental teams involves one or two people being responsible for a workshop, and then specifically going deep into a work zone or a working team, finding key problems in production through personally participating in labor production, discovering fresh things, and timely summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, while also conducting ideological education work for workers, especially backward workers.

During the Great Blooming and Contending, the staff and workers of the No. 1 Cotton Mill raised many opinions about the factory's leading cadres. The workers criticized them for: going to the workshops as if on a "tour," raising a lot of opinions when meetings are held, but not being able to say much about how to do it; technical personnel also criticized them for not studying professional work and technology well enough. The leading cadres themselves also deeply felt that being only "Red" and not "expert," and having only a superficial understanding of production, was increasingly unable to adapt to the development of the situation. In mid-January, Du Liangying, the secretary of the factory's CCP committee, visited Hong'an County, Hubei Province, to observe and learn the working methods of cadres there in cultivating experimental fields. After returning to the factory and conducting research, he decided to engage in experimental work zones or experimental teams based on the specific conditions of the factory, in order to strive to thoroughly change the leadership style of the leading cadres. At the same time, they demanded that everyone learn at least one piece of production knowledge, transforming themselves from laymen into experts, so as to better lead production.

In addition, the factory's leading cadres also decided that no meetings should be held in the morning, and that in addition to learning production and participating in production, they should participate in mass activities as much as possible, such as worker group meetings, recreational activities, and going deep into worker dormitories to talk with workers. The slogan they put forward is: "Living a mass life, cadres becoming workers, labor becoming regularized." This will be first implemented by the leading cadres as an example, and then this practice and style will be promoted to all cadres in the factory, so that the entire factory will achieve a complete integration of cadres and workers.

### 又红又专不做空头政治家  武汉国棉一厂领导干部力求变成内行  积极搞试验工区和试验队  决心做到：生活群众化、干部工人化、劳动经常化

    又红又专不做空头政治家
    武汉国棉一厂领导干部力求变成内行
    积极搞试验工区和试验队
    决心做到：生活群众化、干部工人化、劳动经常化
    新华社武汉29日电　国营武汉第一棉纺织厂党政负责干部学习农村领导干部种试验田的方法，积极搞试验工区、试验队，决心把自己锻炼成又红又专的干部。
    这些负责干部已经从上个星期开始，每星期拿出两个到三个半天的时间，学习生产、参加生产。他们已经和正在同工人订立师徒合同，并且订立了学习技术的个人规划；有些负责干部还自己买了布，做了工作服。
    国棉一厂领导干部在工厂搞试验工区、试验队的作法，比一般纱厂的“一条龙”的工作方法更深入了一步。“一条龙”的工作方法主要是领导干部和技术人员深入到一定工区、工段进行工作指导，但是不参加生产；而试验工区、试验队的作法，是一人或二人负责一个车间，再分别具体深入一个工区或一个工作队，通过亲自参加劳动生产，找出生产中的关键问题，发现新鲜事物，及时总结推广先进经验，同时向工人特别是落后工人进行思想教育工作。
    在大鸣大放中，国棉一厂的职工对厂的领导干部提出很多意见，工人们批评他们是：下车间像是“参观”，开起会来提一大堆意见，但是究竟怎样做，却说不出多少道理来；技术人员对他们不很好钻研业务、技术也提出批评。领导干部们自己也深深感到光“红”不“专”、对生产一知半解，越来越不能适应形势发展。1月中旬，厂的中共党委书记杜良英到湖北省红安县参观和学习了那里的干部搞试验田的工作方法。他回到工厂进行研究以后，便决定根据工厂具体情况搞试验工区或试验队，以力求彻底转变领导干部的领导作风。同时，他们要求每人至少学会一门生产知识，把自己由外行变成内行，以便更好地领导生产。
    此外，厂的领导干部还决定上午一律不开会，除了学习生产、参加生产以外，要尽量多参加群众活动，如工人小组会、文娱活动，深入工人宿舍同工人谈心等。他们提出的口号是：“生活群众化，干部工人化，劳动经常化。”首先由领导干部带头实行，然后再把这种作法和作风推广到全厂干部中去，使整个工厂达到干部和工人完全打成一片。
