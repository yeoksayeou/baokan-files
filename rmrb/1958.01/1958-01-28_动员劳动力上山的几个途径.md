Several Ways to Mobilize Labor to Go to the Mountains
Liu Gengnong
Developing mountainous areas and marching towards the mountains has become an arduous and glorious task for the entire party and the entire people. As Comrade Deng Zihui said: "Mountain production occupies a strategic position in China's national economic construction because: mountainous areas are vast; resources are abundant; potential is unlimited; the future is boundless; and the economic construction of the whole country is extremely important." To develop and build mountainous areas, we must first rely on the strength of the people in the mountainous areas themselves. For thousands of years, the people in China's mountainous areas have accumulated rich experience in developing mountain resources and fighting natural disasters. Especially after liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, miracles have appeared in many formerly very barren mountainous areas. Places like the nationally famous Daquan Mountain in Shanxi, Da Mountain Cooperative in Shandong, Dengjiabao in Gansu, Longwangmiao in Shaanxi, and Jiyuan County in the Manghe River Basin of Henan have all changed their impoverished appearance. These places have achieved amazing results only because the local people fought heroically against nature. This is a good start for developing and building mountainous areas.

However, the general situation in mountainous areas is that the land is vast and the population is sparse, and there is a shortage of labor. In the mountainous areas of northern provinces, for example, each person has an average of six or seven mu of cultivated land, and each laborer often has to bear more than fifty or sixty mu. The same is true in the mountainous areas of the south. In the mountainous areas of Jiangxi, each laborer averages ten mu of farmland and ninety mu of mountain forest. In reality, each laborer can only manage ten mu of farmland and thirty to forty mu of mountain forest. In the mountainous areas of Sichuan, each person has an average of more than four mu of cultivated land, several times more than in the plains (1.85 mu per person) and hilly areas (1.7 mu). Due to the large amount of land and the lack of labor in the mountainous areas, coupled with the fact that people in the mountainous areas suffer from many diseases and live scattered, the labor attendance rate is generally low. At the same time, mountain production has diversity, complexity, and strong seasonality. During certain periods, the use and allocation of labor is particularly tight and difficult to balance.

Therefore, to vigorously develop mountain resources and build prosperous, happy, and comfortable mountainous areas, we must solve the problem of labor shortage in the mountainous areas. Under the current circumstances, mobilizing and encouraging a large number of surplus laborers from the plains and cities to support the mountainous areas is the fundamental way to develop and build mountainous areas.

Various localities have accumulated a lot of experience in this area. The main methods are as follows:

First, advocate "self-migration with public assistance." In the history of our country, farmers in many regions have had the habit of automatic migration, but most of these migrations were forced by farmers in a desperate situation. This was the case with people going "down to Guandong" in the past. At that time, poor farmers often used the phrase "down to Guandong" to describe their unfortunate situation. After liberation, the significance of this migration has completely changed. It is an exciting event in the socialist construction cause. In order to reclaim the land in Heilongjiang Province, as many as 150,000 farmers are migrated every year. Beichuan County in Sichuan Province is a mountainous area. The county currently has 90,000 people, of which 30,000 were migrated after liberation. In July last year, the Sichuan Provincial Mountain Conference called on all localities to use the method of self-migration with public assistance to encourage residents to go to the mountains. Within two months, more than 14,000 households, more than 60,000 people, applied to go to the mountains in the Suining Prefecture, greatly exceeding the planned number for the prefecture. The province initially plans to mobilize more than one million laborers to go to the mountains during the second five-year plan period (more if family members are included), forming a mountain migration movement. According to Heilongjiang Province's calculations, it costs more than 850 yuan per household for the state to organize immigration (excluding the investment spent in the areas from which they move). It costs a lot of money and is difficult to consolidate. If each household of decentralized natural immigrants is given an investment of 150 yuan and a loan of 100 yuan, they can be settled very well.

It can be seen that the method of "self-migration with public assistance" is a very good way to mobilize surplus labor from towns and plains to go to the mountains to solve the labor shortage in the mountainous areas. This method embodies the spirit of the mass line. It can not only mobilize a large number of laborers to develop and build mountainous areas, but also achieve the goal of "saving money and achieving great results."

In the future, in addition to areas with a habit of automatic migration, we should vigorously mobilize the masses to go to the mountains in accordance with this principle. In towns and densely populated plains, we can widely publicize the Party Central Committee's call to "go to the mountains and countryside," and mobilize a large number of laborers to build mountainous areas in a planned and organized manner. Of course, in some special circumstances, where the state must be responsible for immigration, the state organs must be responsible for solving the problem.

Second, encourage agricultural cooperatives in the plains to send production teams to produce in the mountains, organize branch cooperatives, or insert them into existing cooperatives in the mountains. This method has been widely adopted in Guangdong. The specific approach is that cooperatives in the plains send specialized production teams to leave their villages for dozens of miles (20-30 miles in the near distance, 50-60 miles in the far distance), build houses there, and settle down to engage in diversified production. In 1956, there were more than 2,000 production teams in the province going to the mountains for production. This year, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee is also preparing to help 20,000 teams organize about 400,000 laborers to go to the mountains for production. It is understood that most of the production teams sent to the mountains are doing very well. In 1956, the production team sent by Dalushe in Huiyang County had only three people, but it has now increased to thirty people. In 1957, this production team afforested 658 mu, reclaimed 140 mu of wasteland to grow miscellaneous grains, and raised many pigs, chickens, geese, and rabbits. The cash income was 18,000 yuan, and each labor day was worth 1.8 yuan.

The advantage of implementing this method is that it has the support of manpower, material resources, and financial resources from the plains. Its production is part of the production of the original cooperative. The labor force and draught animals are uniformly distributed by the original cooperative. The original cooperative also takes appropriate care of the members who go to the mountains (for example, for the same type of work, the work points for those who go to the mountains are slightly higher, and the food rations are also slightly more). It is not far from the village, and the masses easily accept it. After the members who go to the mountains get used to mountain production, they can settle down and become a new village, and then continue to expand.

Yunnan Province has adopted the method of sending production teams from cooperatives with more labor in the dam areas to the mountains to organize joint cooperatives with cooperatives in the mountains. Jiangxi has adopted the method of organizing mountain branch cooperatives or inserting cooperatives from areas with more labor in the plains or near the mountains. These methods are also worth promoting.

Third, state-owned farms, forest farms, and other units attract labor to go to the mountains in the form of recruitment.

Fujian stipulates that when state-owned farms, forest farms, and logging yards in mountainous areas recruit workers, they should recruit from places with relatively abundant labor in the plains, and encourage them to settle in the mountainous areas. The province also plans to move more than 100,000 people to the mountains within five years. This year, it plans to place 25,000 laborers in farms and forest farms. Sichuan Province has proposed that logging teams, survey teams, and industrial and mining units in mountainous areas should generally not recruit workers locally, and should fully take into account the difficulties of labor shortage in mountainous areas. These regulations are necessary.

Of course, while using various methods to mobilize and encourage surplus labor in the plains to go to the mountains, we should also tap the potential of labor in the mountains. In this regard, many regions have paid attention to improving the labor organization and management of cooperatives, implementing the feasible contract labor and production system in mountainous areas, improving agricultural tools and transportation tools to reduce labor burden and improve work efficiency, and appropriately reducing the compulsory labor of people in mountainous areas. These are all worthy of attention.

Encouraged by the National Agricultural Development Program, mountain construction has already made considerable achievements. For example, Hubei Province has eleven counties with an average yield of 800 jin of grain per mu, several of which are in mountainous areas; and two counties with 100 jin of ginned cotton, one of which is also in a mountainous area. Among the thirty-three mountainous counties in Liaoning, twenty-two have surplus grain, and seven can be self-sufficient. The income of people in mountainous areas has also increased significantly. The average net income per person in Huaiji County, Guangdong Province, is 114 yuan (some cooperatives reach more than 200 yuan); and 97 yuan per person in Guangning County. The average income of farmers in these counties is 70 yuan more than the average net income per person in the province. It is recommended that the actual cases in various localities be fully used to widely publicize to the masses in towns and plains, mobilize a large number of laborers to go to the mountains, and further develop mountain production.

    动员劳动力上山的几个途径
    刘耕农
    开发山区，向山区进军，已成为全党和全民的一项艰巨而光荣的任务。正如邓子恢同志所说的：“山区生产在我国国民经济建设中占有战略性地位，这是因为：山区面积辽阔；资源丰富；潜力无穷；前途无限和全国的经济建设关系极为重大。”开发和建设山区，首先要依靠山区人民自己的力量。几千年来，我国山区人民在开发山区资源和与自然灾害作斗争方面，积累了丰富的经验。特别是解放后，在党的正确领导下，在不少原来是非常贫瘠的山区出现了奇迹。像全国闻名的山西大泉山、山东大山社、甘肃邓家堡、陕西龙王庙以及河南漭河流域的济源县等等，都改变了穷困的面貌。这些地方都是当地人民以英雄气概向大自然奋战才取得了惊人的成绩。这是开发和建设山区的良好的开端。
    可是，山区总的情况是地广人稀、劳力不足。像北方各省的山区，一般是每人平均有六、七亩耕地，每个劳力往往负担五、六十亩以上。南方山区也是一样，像江西山区每个劳力平均负担十亩田和九十亩山林，而按实际情况，当地每个劳力只能经营十亩田和三十——四十亩山林。四川山区每人平均有耕地四亩多，比平坝（每人一点八五亩）和丘陵区（一点七亩）多几倍。由于山区地多劳力少，再加上山区人民疾病多以及居住分散等情况，劳动出勤率一般比较低。同时，山区生产有多样性、复杂性和强烈的季节性，在一定的时期，劳动力的使用调配特别紧张，难以兼顾。
    因此，要大力开发山区资源，建设繁荣、幸福、康乐的山区，必须解决山区劳动力不足的问题。在目前情况下，动员和鼓励平原和城镇的大批多余劳动力去支援山区，是开发山区、建设山区的根本办法。
    各地在这方面已经积累了许多经验，主要方式有如下几种：
    第一，提倡“自移公助”。在我国历史上许多地区的农民就有自动移居的习惯，不过，那多半是农民处于不得已的情况下被迫迁移。人民过去“下关东”，就是如此。那时，贫苦农民常常用“下关东”这句话来形容自己的不幸处境。解放以后，这种迁移的意义已经完全改变了，它是社会主义建设事业中的一件令人兴奋的事情了。为了开垦黑龙江省的土地，每年移去的农民就达十五万人之多。四川省北川县是一个山区，全县现有九万人，其中三万人是解放后移去的。去年7月，四川省在山区会议上号召各地运用自移公助的办法鼓励居民上山以后，两个月内，遂宁专区申请上山的人达一万四千户，六万余人，大大超过专区计划的数目。该省初步计划第二个五年计划期间动员百万余劳动力上山（如加上家属，人口就更多了），形成一个移民上山运动。据黑龙江省的计算，由国家组织移民，每户需投资八百五十多元（还不包括迁出地区花费的投资）。花钱既多、又难巩固。如对分散自然流入的移民每户给一百五十元的投资和一百元的贷款，就可以安置得很好。
    由此可见，“自移公助”的办法，是动员城镇和平原地区多余劳动力上山以解决山区劳动力不足的一个很好的办法。这个办法体现了群众路线的精神，它既能动员大批劳动力去开发山区和建设山区，又可达到“费省效宏”的目的。
    今后除在有自动移居习惯的地区，应当按照这个原则大力动员群众上山外，还可在城镇和人口集中的平原地区，广泛宣传党中央关于“上山下乡”的号召，有计划有组织地动员大批劳动力去建设山区。当然，在某些特殊情况下，必须由国家负责移民的地方，还须由国家机关负责解决。
    第二，鼓励平原地区的农业社派出生产队到山区生产，组织分社或插入山区原有的社。这个办法，广东已普遍采用。具体做法是平原地区的合作社派出专业生产队，离开村子数十里（近则二、三十里，远则五、六十里），在那里盖起房，住下来搞多种生产。该省1956年就有二千多个生产队上山生产，今年广东省委还准备帮助二万个队组织约四十万个劳动力上山生产。据了解，多数社派到山区去的生产队搞得很好。1956年惠阳县大路社派出的生产队只有三人，现已增至三十人。1957年这个生产队造林六百五十八亩，开荒种杂粮一百四十亩，又养了许多猪、鸡、鹅、兔子，现金收入共一万八千元，每个劳动日值一元八角。
    实行这种办法的好处是：它有平原区的人力、物力、财力的支持，它的生产是原社生产的一部分，所用劳动力和耕畜等由原社统一分配，原社对上山的社员也加以适当照顾（如同一工种，上山工种的工分就稍高一些，口粮也稍多一些等）。它离开村庄不远，群众易于接受。上山的社员习惯山区生产后，就可以定居下来，变成一个新村，以后再继续扩展。
    云南省采取坝区劳动力较多的社派出生产队上山同山区社组织联合社的办法，江西采取从平原或山区附近劳动力较多的地区组织山区分社或插社的办法，也是值得推广的。
    第三，由国营农场、林场等单位以招工形式吸引劳动力上山。
    福建规定在山区的国营农场、林场和伐木场等在招收工人的时候，应在平原劳动力比较充裕的地方招收，并鼓励他们在山区定居。这个省还计划五年内移十万人以上上山。今年计划安置在农场和林场的有二万五千个劳动力。四川省提出山区的伐木队。勘查队和工矿单位，一般不应就地招收工人，要充分照顾到山区劳动力不足的困难。这些规定都是必要的。
    当然，运用多种办法动员和鼓励平原多余劳动力上山的同时，也应当挖掘山区劳动潜力。在这一方面，许多地区注意改善社的劳动组织和经营管理，实行山区可行的包工包产制，改良农具和运输工具，以减轻劳力负担和提高工作效率，适当减少山区人民的义务工等等，都是值得重视的。
    在全国农业发展纲要的鼓舞下，山区建设已经有了不小成绩。像湖北省有十一个平均亩产粮食八百斤的县，好几个在山区；两个百斤皮棉县，山区也有一个。辽宁三十三个山区县中，有二十二个县的粮食有了敷余，七个县已能自给。山区人民的收入也有显著增加。广东省怀集县平均每人纯收入为一百一十四元（有些社达到二百多元）；广宁县每人九十七元。这几个县农民的平均收入，比全省平均每人纯收入多七十元。建议应当充分运用各地的实际事例广泛地向城镇和平原地区的群众进行宣传，动员大批劳动力上山，进一步发展山区生产。
