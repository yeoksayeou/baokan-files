Why does adding wine when cooking fish remove the fishy smell?

Cooked fish have less of a fishy smell than raw fish. If you add a little wine when cooking fish, you can get rid of the fishy smell. Why is that?

In the tissues on the surface of fish, there is a fishy-smelling substance called trimethylamine. Trimethylamine is very volatile, and its boiling point is quite low (only 35 degrees Celsius), so raw fish has a particularly strong fishy smell. When cooking fish, the higher temperature causes more of it to evaporate, so cooked fish have less of a fishy smell. However, because trimethylamine is hidden inside the fish tissue, it is not easy to completely evaporate, so cooked fish still have some fishy smell.

Wine contains some alcohol. Trimethylamine is soluble in alcohol. After adding wine, the alcohol can penetrate into the fish tissue and carry the trimethylamine out. Chemically, this effect is called extraction. After the trimethylamine is extracted from the fish, it can quickly evaporate when heated during cooking. This is the reason why wine can remove the fishy smell. (Star)

### 煮鱼时加酒为什么可以去腥？

    煮鱼时加酒为什么可以去腥？
    煮熟了的鱼比生鱼的腥味小一些。如果煮鱼时加一点酒，就可以去掉鱼腥味。为什么呢？
    在鱼体表面的组织里，含有一种有腥味的东西，叫三甲氨。三甲氨很容易挥发，它的沸点也相当低（只有摄氏三十五度），所以生鱼的鱼腥味特别大。煮鱼时，由于温度较高，挥发得多些，所以煮过的鱼腥味较小。但是由于三甲氨藏在鱼体组织里面，不容易完全挥发出来，因此煮过的鱼也多少有些腥味。
    酒，都含有一部分酒精。三甲氨能溶于酒精中。加酒进去后，酒精则可渗入到鱼体的组织里面，把三甲氨带出来。化学上称这种作用为萃取。当三甲氨被提取出鱼体之外后，借煮鱼时的加热，即可很快挥发掉。这就是酒能去除鱼腥的道理。　（星）
