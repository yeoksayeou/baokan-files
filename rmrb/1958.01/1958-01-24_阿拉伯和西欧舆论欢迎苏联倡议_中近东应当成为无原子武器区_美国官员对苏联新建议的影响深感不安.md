Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 23rd: According to a Beirut dispatch from the Indian Press Trust today: Arab political observers welcome the Soviet proposal in its recent statement that nuclear and rocket weapons should not be deployed in the Middle East region.

They believe that since the Turkish government has already agreed to establish missile bases on its territory, if other members of the Baghdad Pact follow suit, it will cause divisions among Arab countries.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: TASS, Tel Aviv, January 22nd: The Israeli "People's Voice" editorial stated that accepting the Soviet proposal "can prevent tragedy in the Middle East and free the region from the danger of a devastating atomic war.... This proposal is in line with Israel's vital interests."

Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: TASS, Paris, January 22nd: Paris newspapers on the 22nd all published the TASS statement regarding the upcoming Baghdad Pact Organization Council meeting. Newspapers and Agence France-Presse in their comments paid particular attention to the new Soviet proposal to "establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East."

"Combat" pointed out in its commentary that the people of the Middle East countries "welcome these proposals which advocate the elimination of war rather than war itself."

"L'Humanité" also wrote: "The Soviet government yesterday put forward new and important proposals aimed at easing international tensions. This proposal will have a profound impact on the countries and people of the Middle East."

Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: TASS, Rome, January 22nd: Italian newspapers prominently published summaries of the TASS authorized statement regarding the Ankara meeting, and many newspapers also published commentaries.

"Unità" emphasized that the TASS statement supplemented previous Soviet proposals aimed at easing international tensions in the region. The newspaper stated that there should be no terrible weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East at all.

Milan's "Il Giorno" pointed out in an editorial that the Baghdad Pact, which is supported in many ways by the United States, is not only a military group but also a political tool.

Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles departed for the Middle East on the 22nd to attend the Baghdad Pact Organization Council meeting scheduled to be held in Ankara from the 27th to the 30th.

Before his departure, Dulles held a long meeting with U.S. President Eisenhower and issued a statement after the meeting saying that the U.S. government would "unswervingly" support the Baghdad Pact, an aggressive organization directly aimed at the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union issued a statement exposing the U.S. plans for the Baghdad Pact Organization Council meeting, the U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 22nd, attempting to deny that the U.S. was forcing the Baghdad Pact countries in the Middle East to agree to allow the U.S. to establish rocket bases.

However, when the State Department spokesperson was asked if the U.S. intended to establish missile bases in the Middle East, the spokesperson did not deny this, nor did he say that the Baghdad Pact meeting would not discuss this issue. His reply was: "I don't know what issues will be discussed at this meeting."

Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: Washington: U.S. officials expressed concern on the 21st about the impact of the Soviet proposal to make the Middle East region a nuclear-weapon-free zone. They opposed this proposal and were concerned that the Soviet proposal would have a "destructive impact" on the upcoming Ankara meeting of the Baghdad Pact countries. They worried whether this proposal would have the same "effect" as the proposal for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, which was put forward on the eve of the Paris meeting of NATO countries.

    阿拉伯和西欧舆论欢迎苏联倡议
    中近东应当成为无原子武器区
    美国官员对苏联新建议的影响深感不安
    据新华社新德里23日电　据印度报业托辣斯今天的贝鲁特消息报道：阿拉伯国家的政治观察家们都欢迎苏联在最近发表的声明中提出的关于不在中东地区设置核武器和火箭武器的建议。
    他们认为，由于土耳其政府已经同意在它的领土上建立导弹基地，如果巴格达条约其他成员国也跟着这样做的话，将会造成阿拉伯国家之间的分裂。
    据新华社讯　塔斯社特拉维夫22日讯：以色列“人民呼声报”社论说，接受苏联的建议“能够防止中近东的惨剧，并且使这个地区摆脱毁灭性原子战争的危险……。这一建议是符合以色列的切身利益的。”
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：巴黎各报22日都刊载了塔斯社就即将举行的巴格达条约集团理事会会议发表的声明。各报和法新社在评论中都特别注视苏联关于“在中近东建立无原子武器区”的新建议。
    “战斗报”在评论中指出，中近东各国人民“欢迎这些不主张战争而主张消除战争的建议”。
    “人道报”也写道：“苏联政府在昨天提出了目的在于缓和国际紧张局势的新的重要建议。这个建议在中近东的国家和人民中将产生深远的反响。”
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社罗马22日讯：意大利各报在显著地位刊登了塔斯社受权就安卡拉会议发表的声明的摘要，许多报纸还发表了评论。
    “团结报”强调指出，塔斯社的声明对苏联过去提出的旨在缓和这一地区国际紧张局势的建议作了补充。这家报纸说，在中东根本不应该有可怕的大规模毁灭性武器。
    米兰“日报”在社论中指出，受到美国多方支持的巴格达集团不仅是一个军事集团，同时还是一个政治工具。
    据新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯22日启程赴中东，参加订于27日到30日在安卡拉举行的巴格达条约组织理事会会议。
    杜勒斯行前同美国总统艾森豪威尔举行了长时间的会谈，并且在会谈后发表声明说，美国政府将“始终不渝地”支持巴格达条约这个矛头直接指向苏联的侵略性组织。在苏联发表揭露美国对巴格达条约组织理事会会议的打算的声明以后，美国国务院在22日发表了一个声明，企图抵赖美国在迫使中东地区的巴格达条约国家同意让美国建立火箭基地。
    但是，当有人问国务院发言人美国是否打算在中东建立导弹基地时，这个发言人并没有否认这一点，他也没有说巴格达条约会议不讨论这个问题，他的回答是：“不知道这个会议将讨论什么问题”。
    据新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：美国官员21日对苏联提出的使中近东地区成为一个无核武器区的建议的影响表示担心。他们反对这种建议，同时担心苏联的建议将对即将举行的巴格达条约国家安卡拉会议“起破坏性的影响”。他们担心这个建议是否会同在北大西洋公约组织国家巴黎会议前夕提出的中欧无核武器区建议一样产生“效果”。
