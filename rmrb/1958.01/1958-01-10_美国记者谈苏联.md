American Journalist Talks About the Soviet Union

    William Randolph Hearst Jr., editor-in-chief and owner of the Hearst newspapers, visited the Soviet Union in November 1957. During his stay in Moscow, Hearst had a conversation with Comrade Khrushchev. The full text of the conversation has been published in Soviet newspapers.

    After returning to the United States, Hearst published a series of articles introducing his visit to the Soviet Union. Before these articles, Hearst wrote an article emphasizing that he "disliked" communism and was a "sincere defender of the American free enterprise system." These articles by Hearst contained anti-Soviet slanders. At the same time, however, the author also acknowledged some important facts in these articles, based on which he concluded that the United States must change its policy toward the Soviet Union.

    Hearst wrote, referring to his meeting with Khrushchev: "One of the most pleasant factors for me personally in talking with this interesting figure was that he (Khrushchev - editor) always treated me realistically. He always called me 'capitalist.' He said more than once that he knew that in many respects I disagreed with him, and on that point, he was naturally right."

    Some of the arguments in Hearst's articles published in the New York "American Journal" are as follows:

    "Three Illusions to Be Abandoned"

    Hearst's first article began by expressing deep concern about the fact that "Western leaders do not understand the basic rules of coexistence based on competition proposed by the Soviet Union."

    Hearst wrote, "For three years (the three years since Hearst's previous visit to the Soviet Union - editor), the Communist strategy has achieved very great victories. The Communists have definitely taken the initiative in the struggle to win the hearts of people around the world.

    Although the first and second artificial satellites have been surprising and frightening, these are only one aspect of the Kremlin's overall plan."

    Hearst believes that if - partially - the United States and - as a whole - the West do not change their policies, there is reason to worry that the Soviet Union will achieve new successes in the coming years and strengthen its advantages.

    Hearst continued, "The moment of our visit was consciously chosen. We chose this day when the communist world was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. In this way, we can see up close the vast Russian masses, who are full of pride - not because of the Bolshevik uprising, but because of Russia's scientific achievements.

    The Soviet Union is very pleased that it has become one of the two most powerful countries in the world, and has actually surpassed the United States at the forefront of science.

    Going to Russia at the beginning of the Russian satellite era is interesting for an American, and at the same time, it can clear his mind...

    It turns out that we Americans have a lot of illusions about communist life.

    Let us list a few illusions that should be abandoned.

    The first illusion: the sensational achievement of launching satellites and other scientific achievements of the Soviet Union are only obtained because the leadership concentrates all resources at the expense of people's livelihood issues such as housing, clothing, and food. Just one fact is enough to dispel this comforting myth.

    In the three years since our last visit, the Russians have begun large-scale construction. Moscow has been greatly beautified.

    When we first visited, a road from Vnukovo Airport to the city passed through empty and desolate places, with low wooden houses on both sides of the road. Today, houses are being built in these places to accommodate two million people.

    More than 400,000 people have moved into these new homes. No matter what language you use, this is considered 'large-scale.'

    People are better dressed than in 1955. Their clothes are not fashionable or elegant... but very practical.

    The food displayed in shop windows is becoming more and more diverse.

    The second illusion: the Russian peace movement is just a propaganda pose, only used for external purposes, and has nothing to do with the Russian people.

    One of the main observations we made during our visit to Russia proves that the opposite is true.

    The suffering caused by the war against Germany was so profound that the Russians still remember the war vividly. Atomic and hydrogen weapon wars will be much more brutal than the war they experienced from 1941 to 1945.

    Therefore, Russians often approached Americans on the street and told them that they urgently needed peace. They said that war was unimaginable. When they said these words, they were so excited that you could see that this feeling came from their hearts, not from being instructed.

    The third illusion: thinking that Russian leaders do not understand the situation in the United States very well, and they only hear what their representatives stationed abroad think they want to hear.

    During our long conversation with Khrushchev, it could be seen that he knew the latest major news in the United States from the source.

    This familiarity with current events in the United States once again shows that the Kremlin's future strategy will be based on accurately estimating Western events and intentions."

    Hearst finally emphasized that the Soviet Union "will implement a policy aimed at avoiding war and will continue to carry out the movement for peace."

    "Russia's Amazing Education Machine"

    Hearst wrote in an article titled "Scientists Have Now Become the Kremlin's Royalty": "It is absolutely necessary that the achievements of the Soviet Union in nuclear weapons and long-range nuclear weapon delivery equipment, as well as in launching satellites, have set off alarm bells in the American education community. One of the purposes of our visit to Russia was to study the amazing achievements of this once extremely backward country in aspects that the West, especially our country, considers to be unique to ourselves.

    Newcomers do not need long to get a complete concept of this aspect. We began to feel this way when we flew from Prague to Moscow on a 'Tu-104' jet passenger plane (seventy passenger seats). This type of aircraft has been flying regularly on Soviet routes for more than a year. And our similar jet aircraft 'Boeing-707' and 'Douglas-DS-5' will not become regulars in our skies until 1959.

    Russian aeronautical engineers obviously do not need to 'steal secrets' or use 'captured' German experts to manufacture the 'Tu-104' or the huge turboprop airliner 'Tu-114.' They built all of this from scratch. These aircraft are a natural symbol of Russia's respect for engineers.

    ...(Moscow) University has twelve departments and nearly 26,000 to 30,000 undergraduates and graduate students. There are currently 766 colleges and universities and 2,756 scientific research institutes in the Soviet provinces, including more than two million people. In addition, there are nearly two million people studying in spare-time technical schools.

    These figures are roughly equal to the number of students in our country's colleges and universities, but these figures do not express how much the Russians value teaching precise sciences."

    Hearst wrote, pointing out that the Soviet Union implements compulsory education for children aged seven to seventeen and that college students enjoy scholarships: "In Russia, everyone can receive higher education. The masses are very interested in higher education, just like other countries are very interested in sports, fashion, and money... and so on.

    In Russia, all scientific departments show a true enthusiasm for pure research work."

    Hearst continued, "Currently, nearly one million people in Russia are receiving higher education through night schools and correspondence courses. They are highly respected and encouraged because most of them do practical work during the day and theoretically explore their work in the evening or through correspondence. The combination of theory and practice dominates Russian thought.

    In this country, which was not long ago the most educationally backward in the world, perhaps the most amazing achievement in opening up a new era of scientific peaks is that the new intelligentsia is not composed of people from excellent families (if you can call it that), nor necessarily urban residents who have received a good elementary education.

    Siberia, which the West is terrified of, has become a vast whole composed of recently built cities, factories, and research work and development plans.

    The Soviet Union's control target for 1960 is to train four million specialized talents. We cannot yet say what the United States' control target is. These are just rough depictions that we have come into contact with after contacting Russia's amazing education machine, which shows what a determined people can do..."

    "Underestimating Soviet Science"

    Hearst pointed out at the beginning of the third article, "During World War II, an emotion grew in the United States that completely disregarded the Russians, thinking that they were not good at construction."

    Hearst continued: "When the Russians made the atomic bomb, and later the hydrogen bomb, Americans always said that this was mainly due to captured German scientists and some people who told them the secrets, and the Smith report, which was published and disseminated after the victory over Japan, contained part of this secret.

    The 'MiG-15' aircraft sent by the Russians to Korea, every pilot who has fought with it will say that it is an excellent fighter. But Americans insisted that this was the credit of the German designers who were looted by the Russians at the end of World War II. Many of us are unwilling to admit that the Russians themselves have done a lot in their rocket manufacturing program. We said again, this is probably the power of 'captured German scientists who once made V-2 rockets.'

    Now there are satellites - peaceful space ships, which have made great contributions to the entire science. And Khrushchev emphasized to us that the satellites were put into orbit by intercontinental ballistic rockets.

    He said casually that the only difference between the intercontinental ballistic rocket that sent the satellite and the intercontinental ballistic rocket that can carry a hydrogen bomb to American cities thousands of miles away from the Soviet launch pad is that the latter is loaded with a warhead for combat. He said, and the satellite is a 'peaceful warhead.'

    If there is such a small circle that stubbornly believes that Russian scientists can't do anything themselves, then this small circle is probably the Senate's Internal Security Committee."

    Hearst continued: "This visit has made us more clearly aware that for many years our country has greatly underestimated Soviet science, and we can no longer sit back and relax. Russian science has made great strides in recent years, and it will not be complacent and satisfied, giving us time to catch up with it in those aspects where it significantly exceeds us. Russian universities and specialized scientific research institutes are training a large number of new young scientists, who are working hard to strengthen Russia's new ambition to dominate rocket manufacturing and interstellar travel.

    But this does not mean that other departments where we previously felt foolproof have not been spiritually bombarded by Soviet science."

    "An Agreement Must Be Reached"

    In the last article entitled "How Americans Can Win the 'World'," Hearst asked the United States to "make serious and solemn decisions" if the United States wants to defeat Russia's advantage and finally take the initiative in the "global struggle."

    Hearst then put forward "three basic suggestions." He advised Eisenhower to establish a small cabinet, which should be a "peace cabinet."

    Hearst then suggested setting up a permanent planning agency to study the overall strategy for winning the struggle of "coexistence on a competitive basis."

    Hearst wrote: "The third suggestion is that President Eisenhower should one day sit down with Khrushchev at a table to conduct talks after obtaining the full agreement of our allies."

    Hearst believes that it would be wrong for the President to accept Bulganin's recent proposal for direct talks at this time. This would only be seen by the Soviet leaders as a sign of weakness.

    Hearst said: "But I think the appropriate time for the President to negotiate with Khrushchev may come after our own 'satellite' is in the sky. This current stalemate in relations between East and West may not be eliminated at this conference, but in any case, we should try it.

    The United States and Russia are the two largest countries in the world. If they can reach an agreement on maintaining peace, other countries can get rid of the terror of atomic war destruction." (Excerpted and translated from the Soviet "Pravda" on December 21, 1957)

专栏：

    美国记者谈苏联
    “赫斯特系报纸”托辣斯总编辑兼所有人小威·伦·赫斯特1957年11月访问了苏联。赫斯特在逗留莫斯科期间同赫鲁晓夫同志举行了谈话。谈话全文已在苏联报纸上发表。
    赫斯特返美国后，发表了一系列文章，介绍访苏情况。在这些文章之前，赫斯特写了一篇文章，着重指出，他“不喜欢”共产主义，他是“美国自由企业制度的真诚维护者”。赫斯特的这些文章中包含着反苏谰言。但同时，在这些文章中，作者也承认了一些重要的事实，根据这些事实，他得出结论：美国必须改变对苏联的政策。
    赫斯特在谈到同赫鲁晓夫的会见时写道：“同这个饶有风趣的人物谈话时使我个人最感愉快的因素之一是：他（赫鲁晓夫——编者）一直是实事求是地对待我。他总是称我为‘资本家’。他不止一次地说，他知道，在许多方面我是不同意他的意见的，在这一点上，他自然是说对了”。
    赫斯特在纽约“美国人日报”上所发表的文章中的一些论点如下：
    “应当抛弃的三种错觉”
    赫斯特的第一篇文章一开始就对“西方领导人不懂得苏联所建议的、以竞赛为基础的共处的基本规则”这种情况表示深感不安。
    赫斯特写道，“三年来（从赫斯特前次访问苏联之后的三年以来——编者），共产党的战略取得了非常大的胜利。共产党人在全世界争取人心的斗争中，肯定地取得了主动权。
    虽然第一颗人造卫星和第二颗人造卫星已经令人惊讶和使人恐惧，但是这些只不过是克里姆林的总计划的一个方面而已。”
    赫斯特认为，如果——局部来说——美国以及——整个来说——西方不改变政策的话，那就有理由耽心：苏联将在今后的年代中取得新的成就，并且加强它的优势。
    赫斯特继续说，“我们访问的时刻是有意识地选定的。我们选择了正当共产主义世界庆祝十月革命四十周年的这个日子。这样，我们就可以在近处看看广大俄国群众，他们充满了自豪——不是由于布尔什维克的起义，而是由于俄国的科学成就。
    苏联大为高兴的是，它变成了世界上两个最强大国家中的一个，而且实际上在科学的最前线已经超过了美国。
    在俄国卫星世纪的初期到俄国去，对一个美国人来说是有趣的，而同时也是可以使他的头脑清醒的……。
    事实证明：我们美国人对共产主义生活有不少错觉。
    让我们列举几个应加以抛弃的错觉吧。
    第一个错觉：轰动一时的发射卫星的成就和苏联在科学方面的其他成就，仅只是由于领导机关不惜牺牲诸如住宅、衣著和粮食等民生问题，而集中了一切资源才获得的。只要举一个事实就足以打消这种聊以自慰的神话了。
    在我们前一次访问后的三年来，俄国人开始了大规模的建设。莫斯科大大地美化了。
    当我们第一次去访问时，从伏努科夫机场通往市内的一条道路穿过空旷和荒凉的地方，道路两旁都是矮小的木屋。今天在这些地方正在修建给两百万人居住的住宅。
    已经有四十多万人搬进了这些新住宅。不管用哪国语言说，这都算得上是‘大规模的’。
    人们比1955年时穿得好了。他们的服装说不上什么时髦或雅致……但是很实用。
    商店橱窗内陈设的食品愈来愈多种多样了。
    第二个错觉：俄国的保卫和平运动不过是一种宣传姿态，只用来对外，而对俄国人民没有任何关系。
    我们在俄国访问期间所作的一次主要观察证明，事实恰恰相反。
    对德战争所造成的苦难是如此深重，以至俄国人对这次战争记忆犹新。原子武器和氢武器战争将比他们在1941年到1945年所经历的战争残酷得多。
    因此，俄国人在街上常常走到美国人跟前，向美国人说，他们迫切需要和平。他们说，战争是不可想像的。他们在说这些话的时候是那么激动，你可以看到：这种感情出自他们的内心，而不是受人指使而产生的。
    第三个错觉：认为俄国领导人很不了解美国的情况，他们所听到的只是他们的驻国外的代表认为他们想听的东西。
    在我们同赫鲁晓夫进行长时间谈话的过程中，可以看出，他源源本本地知道美国最近的重大消息。
    这样熟悉美国当前的事件这一点又一次表明：克里林姆宫未来的战略将以精确估计西方的事件和意图为基础。”
    赫斯特最后着重指出，苏联“将执行旨在避免战争的政策，并且将继续进行争取和平的运动”。
    “俄国惊人的教育机器”
    赫斯特在题为“科学家目前成了克里姆林宫王族”一文中写道：“由于苏联在核武器和远距离发射核武器设备方面以及在发射卫星方面的成就，在美国教育界敲起了警钟，这是十分必要的。我们访问俄国的目的之一，就是研究这个曾经极端落后的国家在西方、特别是在我国认为是自己独有的那些方面所取得的惊人成就。
    新到的人不需要很久就会得出这方面的完整概念。当我们乘坐‘图—104’喷气客机（七十个客座）从布拉格飞到莫斯科时就开始有这种感觉了。这种飞机定期在苏联航线上飞行已经一年有余。而我们的同样的喷气式飞机‘波音—707’和‘道格拉斯—D S—5’要成为我们空中的常客却不会早于1959年。
    俄国的航空工程师显然不需要‘偷窃秘密’或者利用‘俘掳过来的’德国专家来制造‘图—104’或者巨大的涡轮喷气螺旋桨客机‘图—114’。他们建造这一切都是从头开始的。这些飞机是俄国对工程师尊敬的自然标志。
    ……（莫斯科）大学具有十二个院和将近两万六千到三万名大学生和研究生。在苏联的外省目前有七百六十六所高等学校和两千七百五十六所科学研究所，共包括有两百多万人。另外还有将近两百万人在业余技术学校中学习。
    这些数字大约等于我国大专学校的学生人数，但是这些数字还表达不出俄国人是何等注重教授精密科学。”
    赫斯特在指出苏联实行七岁到十七岁儿童的义务教育和高等学校学生享有助学金时写道：“在俄国所有的人都可以受高等教育。群众对高等教育的兴趣非常大，就像其他国家对运动、时装和金钱……等很感兴趣一样。
    在俄国各科学部门都表现出纯粹研究工作的真正热情。”
    赫斯特接着写道，“目前俄国有将近一百万人通过夜校和函授方法受高等教育。他们很受尊重并得到鼓励，因为他们当中大多数人是白天进行实际工作，而晚上或者通过函授来对他们的工作进行理论上的探讨。在俄国的思潮中理论和实践相结合占统治地位。
    在这个不久前世界上教育最落后的国家里，能够取得开辟科学顶峰新纪元的最惊人的成就恐怕是在于，组成新知识分子的不是优秀家庭（如果可以这样称呼的话）出身的人，也不一定是受过良好初等教育的城市居民。
    西方人闻之生畏的西伯利亚变成了一个由不久前建成的城市、工厂以及研究工作和发展计划的庞大整体。
    苏联到1960年的控制数字是培养出四百万专门人材。我们还无法说出美国的控制数字是多少。这些只不过是我们接触到俄国的惊人的教育机器以后所描写出的粗略景象，它说明充满决心的人民能够做出什么……。”
    “对苏联科学估计过低”
    赫斯特在第三篇文章的开始时指出，“在第二次世界大战期间，在美国滋长了完全不把俄国人放在眼里的情绪，认为他们在建设上不行”。
    赫斯特接着说：“当俄国人制成原子弹，后来又制成氢弹的时候，美国人总说，这主要是靠被俘掳的德国科学家以及一些把秘密告诉了他们的人，在战胜日本之后公布和传播的史密斯报告中就包含这种秘密的一部分。
    俄国人派往朝鲜的‘米格—15’式飞机，每一个同它交过手的飞行员都会说，这是出色的歼击机。可是美国人偏要说这是在第二次世界大战结束时被俄国人掳去的德国设计师的功劳。我们有许多人不愿意承认俄国人自己在他们的火箭制造计划方面做了不少事情。我们这些人又说了，这大概是‘被俘掳的、曾经制造成V—2火箭的德国科学家’的力量。
    现在出现了卫星——和平宇宙飞船，它对整个科学有很大贡献。而赫鲁晓夫向我们强调指出，卫星是被洲际弹道火箭纳入轨道的。
    他顺便说了一句，送出卫星的洲际弹道火箭同可以把氢弹带到离苏联发射台几千英里远的美国大城市的洲际弹道火箭之间的唯一区别就是，后者装的是作战用的弹头。他说，而卫星则是‘和平的弹头’。
    如果说有这么一个小圈子，它固执地认为俄国科学家自己什么也干不出来，那末这个小圈子大概就是参议院的国内安全委员会了。”
    赫斯特接着说：“我们这次访问使我们更清楚地知道，许多年来我国对苏联科学十分估计不足，我们再也不能高枕无忧了。俄国科学几年来大踏步地迈进了，而且它不会因此自满自足，给我们时间，让我们在它显著超过我们的那些方面赶上它。俄国各大学和各专门科学研究所正在培养大批新的青年科学家，他们努力于加强俄国在火箭制造和星际旅行方面占优势的新野心。
    但这并不是说，我们以前感到万无一失的其他部门没有遭到苏联科学的精神轰炸。”
    “必须达成协议”
    在最后一篇题为“美国人怎样才能赢得‘世界’”的文章中，赫斯特要求美国“作出认真严肃的决定”，如果美国想打垮俄国的优势，并且最后使自己在“全球的斗争中”取得主动权的话。
    赫斯特接着提出“三项基本建议”。他劝告艾森豪威尔成立一个小内阁，这个内阁应该是“和平内阁”。
    赫斯特接着建议设立一个常设计划机构，以研究在“竞赛基础上共处”的斗争中取得胜利的总战略。
    赫斯特写道：“第三项建议就是，艾森豪威尔总统应该有朝一日在取得我们盟国完全同意以后同赫鲁晓夫坐在一张桌子上进行会谈”。
    赫斯特认为，如果总统目前就接受布尔加宁最近提出的关于进行直接会谈的建议，那是错误的。这只会被苏联领导人认为是软弱的表现。
    赫斯特说：“可是我认为，总统同赫鲁晓夫谈判的适当时机，在我们自己的‘卫星’上了天之后是可能到来的。目前东西方之间关系中的这种僵局也许不能在这种会议上消除，但是，无论如何总应当尝试一番。
    美国和俄国是世界上两个最大的国家。如果它们能够就维护和平这个问题达成协议，其他国家就能摆脱对原子战争毁灭的恐怖。”　（摘译自1957年12月21日苏联“真理报”）
