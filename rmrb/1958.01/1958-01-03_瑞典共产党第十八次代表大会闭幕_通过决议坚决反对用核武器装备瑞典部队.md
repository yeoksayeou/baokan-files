Xinhua News Agency, January 1st, Stockholm, TASS, December 31, 1957: The 18th Congress of the Communist Party of Sweden concluded here on December 31, 1957.

The Congress elected a Central Committee composed of forty-five members and fifteen alternate members. The new Central Committee has elected an Executive Committee of eleven members, with Hagberg re-elected as Chairman of the Party. The Congress also held elections for the Supervisory Committee.

A political resolution was adopted at the Congress. In his closing remarks, Hagberg emphasized that the delegates were united on the Party's basic political line.

The Congress adopted a resolution on ideological struggle, which emphasized that the struggle for peace is the most important issue at the present stage. The resolution also stressed the need to intensify the struggle against reactionary propaganda, which seeks to make Sweden abandon its policy of non-alignment, believe that Sweden must arm itself with atomic and hydrogen weapons, and join the military blocs of Western countries.

The Congress elected a committee of twelve people to propose revisions to the Party's current program, "The Swedish Road to Socialism." This committee will report on its work at the next Congress.

On the 29th, the Congress unanimously adopted a resolution expressing firm opposition to the purchase of atomic weapons and the equipping of Swedish armed forces with nuclear weapons.

On the 29th and 30th, the Congress discussed the summary report of the Central Committee and heard the report by Central Secretary Knut Tell on organizational issues, the Party's working methods, and the current tasks of the Party organization.
