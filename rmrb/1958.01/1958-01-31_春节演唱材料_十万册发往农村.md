Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: Over 100,000 copies of literary pamphlets, intended as performance materials for the Spring Festival for the rural population, have recently been distributed to more than 570 Xinhua bookstores across the country for sale.

The majority of these pamphlets contain works that reflect real life through folk storytelling forms. The genres are rich and varied, including popular and easy-to-learn Shandong Kuaishu, Danxian, drum lyrics, and Zhui Zi storytelling, as well as short and concise plays and operas. The Quyi form "Cart Lantern: The Man-Made Satellite Wreaks Havoc in Heaven" vividly narrates the significance of artificial satellites to human history. "Autumn Night Song" uses the singing and dancing of young men and women to recall how they fought against capitalist ideas in a debate. The drum lyric "Happy Reunion" depicts the story of middle school graduates participating in agricultural production and educating rural girls who wanted to escape production. The short play "District Chief Goes to the Mountain Village" describes how a Communist Party member in an old revolutionary base sincerely and skillfully educated a subjective young district chief. Among the mini-operas, there are also "Old Yang Treats Cattle" and "Borrowing a Horse," which reflect how collectivist thought overcame selfish and self-interested bourgeois thought among farmers.

    春节演唱材料
    十万册发往农村
    据新华社30日讯　供应农村人民在春节期间作为演唱材料的十万多册文艺小册子，最近已发交全国各地五百七十多个新华书店出售。
    这批小册子大部是通过民间说唱形式反映现实生活的作品，体裁很丰富，其中有通俗易学的山东快书、单弦、鼓词和坠子等曲艺，也有短小精悍的话剧和歌剧。曲艺车灯“人造卫星大闹天宫”生动有趣地叙述了人造卫星对于人类历史的意义；“秋夜曲”用青年男女载歌载舞的演唱形式，回忆了在一个辩论会上怎样对资本主义思想进行斗争的情景；鼓词“喜相逢”描写中学毕业生参加农业生产教育了想脱离生产的农村姑娘的故事。小型话剧“区长到山村”是描写在革命老根据地的一个共产党员怎样诚恳而巧妙地教育了一个主观主义的青年区长。小歌剧中还有“老杨医牛”、“借马”等，是反映集体主义思想在农民中如何战胜自私自利的资产阶级思想的故事。
