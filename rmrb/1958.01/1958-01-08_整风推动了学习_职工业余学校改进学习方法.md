　　This newspaper reports that many staff and worker spare-time schools in various places suspended classes during the rectification movement in the second half of last year. Recently, staff and worker spare-time schools in Henan, Fujian, Baoding, Nanchang, and other places have resumed classes one after another. In many places, the rectification has also promoted learning, creating many learning methods. For example, the Xiaoyi Machine Tile Factory, during the upsurge of airing views, changed centralized class teaching to decentralized contracted teaching and learning, resulting in more than 200 contracted teaching and learning organizations that persisted in spare-time cultural learning. The No. 1 Staff and Worker Joint School, such as the Puyun Flour Mill in Anyang City, Henan Province, adopted the method of studying at three different times: morning, noon, and evening. The number of staff and workers participating in learning was more than double the number of students enrolled in the previous period. In response to units with too many class suspensions or late school openings, the Nanping Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Fujian Province also proposed appropriately increasing weekly or daily study time, extending the semester, and shortening the winter vacation period, striving to basically complete the established teaching tasks.

    整风推动了学习
    职工业余学校改进学习方法
    本报讯　去年下半年，不少地方的职工业余学校在开展整风运动中停了课。最近，河南、福建、保定、南昌等地职工业余学校已经先后复课。许多地方，整风还推动了学习，创造了不少的学习办法，如孝义机瓦厂在鸣放高潮中，把集中的班级教学，改为分散的包教保学，结果有二百多起包教保学的学习组织，坚持了业余文化学习。河南安阳市普润面粉厂等第一职工联校，采取了早、午、晚三个时间分别学习的办法，职工参加学习的人数为上期在学人数的一倍多。福建南平专署对停课太多或开学太迟的单位，还提出适当增加每周或每天学习时间，延长学期，缩短寒假时期的办法，争取基本上完成既定的教学任务。
