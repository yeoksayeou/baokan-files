Changsha, This Newspaper, 29th – Hunan Province is vigorously developing a new type of water lifting tool: the water turbine pump. The Hunan Provincial Department of Heavy Industry plans to produce 3,500 water turbine pumps this year, of which 957 have already been produced in machinery factories in Changsha, Hengyang, Shaoyang, and other places. Water conservancy departments and agricultural cooperatives in various regions are actively placing orders with factories that produce water turbine pumps.

The water turbine pump is a hydraulic pumping machine that does not require fuel, a machine room, or specialized technicians for management. It has a simple structure, consisting of a water turbine and a centrifugal water pump (i.e., a water pump) coaxially assembled. As long as it is installed in a river with a water level difference, it can use the impetus of the water flow to rotate the water turbine, which in turn drives the water pump to draw water. When the water level difference reaches two meters, a medium-sized water turbine pump can lift water to a height of eight to ten meters, irrigating more than 400 mu of land, which is more than ten times the water lifting capacity of the old-fashioned waterwheels. In addition to pumping water for irrigation, the water turbine pump can also be modified to generate eight horsepower, which can drive a complete set of rice milling machines or a five-kilowatt generator.

Hunan Province has many mountains and dense forests, with extremely abundant water resources and steep streams. In 1956, the five water turbine pumps installed by the Hunan Provincial Department of Water Conservancy in Lianyuan and Dongkou counties performed well and were very popular among farmers.

    充分利用水流冲力提水灌溉
    湖南大量生产水轮泵
    本报长沙29日电　湖南省正在大力发展一种新型的提水工具——水轮泵。湖南省重工业厅今年计划生产水轮泵三千五百台，其中有九百五十七台已分别在长沙、衡阳、邵阳等地机械厂生产。各地水利部门和农业社正纷纷向生产水轮泵的工厂订货。
    水轮泵是一种不用燃料、不用机房、不需专门技工管理的水力抽水机。构造简单，是由水轮机和离心水泵（即抽水机）同轴合组而成。只要安装在有水位差的河流里，利用水流的冲力转动水轮，就可带动水泵抽水。在水位差达到两公尺时，一台中等的水轮泵，抽水高度可达八到十公尺，能灌四百多亩田，比旧式筒车提水能力大十多倍。水轮泵除能抽水灌溉外，经过改装，还可产生八匹马力，能带动全套碾米机或五瓩的发电机。
    湖南省山多林密，溪流湍急，水利资源极为丰富。1956年，湖南省水利厅在涟源、洞口两县安装的五台水轮泵效果良好，极受农民欢迎。
