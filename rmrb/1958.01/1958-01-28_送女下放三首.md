    Three Poems on Sending My Daughter to the Countryside
    Wang Kunlun

    I. Sending my daughter down to Yangzhou is truly a heroic feat, taking up a pen to farm.
    Do not forget the lessons of the land reform and the “three togethers.”
    You are still young, and I am not old; only joy, no sorrow.
    This is a thorough remolding.
    Strive to help ensure a good harvest of grains.
    Sailing together, overcoming all obstacles.

    II. Lights shine brightly at the station, cheers resound.
    Bid farewell to the old year with the Anti-Rightist campaign and rectification.
    You will cultivate fields by the river, rain after rain.
    Forever loyal, sharpening your resolve to the utmost.
    Wave goodbye, departing with a smile.
    Eliminate pests and benefit agriculture in the new year.
    I think of every grain in the bowl.
    I hope that both the city and the countryside will be free from shame.

    III. Born into a feudal family,
    Today, Little Mei recognizes her mother anew.
    To know the price of rice, one must have bones soaked in paddy fields.
    Tell my daughter not to worry about me.
    Empty talk of workers and peasants is vague.
    In the past, Paul became steel.
    Find fertilizer at dawn, aware of the value of manure.
    Wholeheartedly work for the peasants.

〔Note〕Refers to the story of Yang Xiaomei recognizing a peasant woman as her mother, a metaphor for the need to completely change one's class.
