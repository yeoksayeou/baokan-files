Are You Preparing to Go Home for the Spring Festival?
Please Heed My Lesson

After reading Comrade Huang Xiuying's letter "Is This Wasteful?", I was reminded of myself. It is especially necessary to raise this issue when many comrades are preparing to go home for the Spring Festival.

Last year during the Spring Festival, I went home. I hadn’t seen my wife in years, so going home was understandable. However, in order to return home in a presentable "manner," I bought myself a "presentable" outfit and some "presentable" gifts. Coupled with the long distance, the trip cost me two or three hundred yuan, resulting in a debt of over one hundred yuan. Last summer, I unfortunately fell ill and had no choice but to apply for subsidies. To make matters worse, my wife gave birth to a child last November, and I applied for another ten yuan in subsidies. Almost a year has passed, but the debt I incurred to go home has not yet been cleared. What good did this do for myself or the country?

Now, the Spring Festival is approaching, and from what I know, some comrades preparing to return home are making the same mistake I did. I have a fellow villager who started preparing for this trip as early as last January. He originally had an East German pocket watch but felt it wasn't ideal, so he sold it and spent 151 yuan to buy another one; he spent over 30 yuan to buy a raincoat and over 20 yuan to buy a pair of leather shoes; he already had a woolen pair of pants and a serge pair of pants, as well as a cotton coat, but recently he spent over 100 yuan to buy a wool overcoat and nearly 100 yuan to have a set of serge clothes made. I feel that the idea of ​​“returning home in glory” probably extends beyond just me and him. Therefore, it is necessary to raise this issue and ask comrades who are preparing to return home to visit their families to consider: Do you also have this kind of thinking?

### 你准备春节回家吗？  请接受我的教训

    你准备春节回家吗？
    请接受我的教训
    看了黄秀英同志的“这是浪费吗？”的来信后，使我想起了自己。特别是在好多同志准备回家过春节的时候，把这个问题提出来更有必要。
    去年春节，我回家一趟。几年未见爱人了，回家一趟是可以的。可是，为了回家得像个“样”，自己添了件把像“样”的衣服，买了一些像“样”的礼物，加上路程远，来回花了二、三百元，结果负债一百多元。去年夏天不幸得了病，没办法只得申请补助。真是祸不单行，去年11月爱人生了小孩，又申请补助十元。至今快一年了，但为了回家借的债还没还清。这不论对自己、对国家又有什么好处呢？
    现在，春节快要到了，据我知道，有些准备回家的同志又犯上了我这个毛病。我有一个同乡，他为了这次回家，远在去年1月就开始准备了。他本来有一个东德的怀表，嫌它不够理想，把怀表卖了，花了一百五十一元另买了一只怀表；花三十多元买一件雨衣，二十多元买一双皮鞋；他本来有一条呢裤和一条毛哔叽裤，也有一件棉衣，但最近又花了一百多元买一件呢大衣，花了将近一百元做了一套毛哔叽的衣服。我觉得，有
  “衣锦还乡”的思想的人，恐怕不止是我和他。因此，有必要提出这个问题，请准备回乡探亲的同志们注意一下：自己是否也有这种思想？
