Macmillan told the Indian people on January 9th: "For many years, we have been sharing sweetness and bitterness together."

However, two days later, when reporters asked him about the Goa issue, he replied: Portugal is a "very old" ally of Britain, and it would be "foolish" for Britain to intervene in the Goa issue.

For the Indian people who have gained independence after a long struggle, liberating Goa, which is still under colonial rule, is their most urgent desire; but for the British Prime Minister, the mention of the Goa issue reminds him of the "very old" ally, Portugal. It can be seen from this that even within the same Commonwealth, the old colonial empire of Britain and the anti-colonialist India have completely different feelings about what is sweet and what is bitter.

    甘苦不同
    麦克米伦在1月9日曾经对印度人民说：“许多年来我们一直是同甘共苦的。”
    但是，两天以后，当记者就果阿问题向他发问时，他回答道：葡萄牙是英国的一个“非常老的”盟国，英国出来过问果阿问题是“愚蠢的”。
    对于经过长期斗争而获得独立的印度人民来说，解放还处在殖民统治下的果阿是他们最迫切的愿望；而对于英国首相来说，一提起果阿问题就想起了“非常老的”盟国葡萄牙。由此可见，即使同在一个英联邦之内，老牌殖民帝国的英国和反对殖民主义的印度甘苦也是截然不同的。
