To Make Advanced Experiences Blossom Everywhere
——Problems Encountered by Shanxi Province in Promoting Advanced Agricultural Experiences
　　Ma Ming
　　Shanxi Province has more than twenty kinds of advanced experiences in rural work and production construction, including technical experiences to increase grain and cotton production, water and soil conservation experiences, livestock breed improvement experiences, "four-sides" greening experiences, experiences in consolidating the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives, and experiences in deeply leading large-scale production. Most of these experiences have been cultivated for a long time and are relatively mature.

　　Two Approaches
　　The situation of promoting advanced experiences shows that two different approaches have brought about different results. One is the practice of the Yanbei area in promoting the water and soil conservation experience of Daquanshan (hilly loess area). This is: first, carefully summarize the experience and affirm that this experience conforms to the law of mountain area transformation. Then, adopt the method of "overall layout, using points to drive areas, focusing on leadership, and universal blossoming" to universally promote this experience. In the process of promotion, in addition to using Daquanshan as a model to publicize the principles of building mountain areas, more detailed organizational work was carried out. For example, water and soil conservation training classes were held in Daquanshan, and cadres from counties, townships, and cooperatives, as well as active farmers, were organized to visit and study in Daquanshan, and people were sent from Daquanshan to spread the experience to various places. In this way, a living model of learning from Daquanshan was established in various places. Counties, townships, and cooperatives all formulated specific plans and implementation measures to learn from Daquanshan. After this series of efforts, within only a little over a year, the miracle of "Daquanshan" in every township appeared in this area, and the area of barren mountains and gullies initially managed accounted for 30% of the total area of hilly loess in the area.

　　The other is the practice of promoting the water and soil conservation and long-term comprehensive planning experience of Yangjingdi (stone mountain area) in Ping順county. Originally, promoting this experience was of great significance for fundamentally changing the face of the stone mountain area, which accounts for 51% of the total mountain area of the province, developing the rich resources of the mountain area, and increasing the income of farmers in the mountain area. In order to promote this typical experience, which was summarized as early as 1953, training classes were held and visits were organized in the past. However, because the experience was not summarized specifically and clearly enough, and there were more general calls and less specific organizational leadership in the promotion, in the past four years, very few people in the province have promoted this experience.

　　Situations similar to the latter approach exist universally in most areas of the province. For example, some technical experiences in increasing grain and cotton production in the Taihang Mountain grain-producing area and the Jinnan cotton-producing area, the experience of improving cattle breeds in Xi County, the experience of "four-sides" greening in Xia County, and some experiences in the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives were discovered and summarized relatively early, but the promotion was very uneven, and some areas did not promote them at all.

　　Due to the slow promotion of advanced experiences, the state of isolated advanced typical examples and unbalanced work development has appeared in rural work. At the same time, this is also an important reason for the slow rise in grain and cotton production in the province. Now the whole country knows about the experience of Jiyuan County, Henan Province, in governing the Manghe River with "overall planning and comprehensive management." In fact, this experience was enriched after learning from the experience of Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, in governing Daquanshan. Macheng County, Hubei Province, universally promoted the experience of planned management of agricultural cooperatives in Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province—"Knowing a Year Early," and the effect of promotion was much better than the promotion of "Knowing a Year Early" in other counties in Shanxi Province. Why can these advanced experiences quickly blossom and bear fruit in fraternal provinces, but are not easily promoted in this province and county? The reason here is worth pondering deeply.

　　Where is the Reason?
　　Why can't various advanced typical experiences be quickly and universally promoted? The agricultural leading organs of Shanxi Province have repeatedly studied this. From the perspective of leadership thinking, the reason is that the leading organs in many areas do not have a clear understanding of the important contents of these advanced experiences and the huge role these advanced experiences play in changing local natural conditions and promoting agricultural production increase after they are universally promoted. They have not deeply understood the principles of cultivating typical examples, universally promoting them, promoting backwardness, and driving the general, and some areas are even unwilling to learn from the advanced experiences of other counties and cooperatives. This is manifested in the fact that some areas neglect the careful summary and promotion of advanced experiences, know very little about the situation of backward areas, and do not help to improve them enough. This makes the work of advanced cooperatives lively and bustling, while the work of backward cooperatives is cold and deserted. Some people say: "We also have the experiences of other places here, but we lack summary, and the summary will be even better than theirs." Some comrades even compare their own objective difficulties with the superior conditions of others, saying: "The original foundation of our place is very backward, and the natural conditions are very bad. Although the experiences of other places are good, they cannot be promoted here." Due to the above-mentioned complacency with the status quo, conservatism, and the idea of rejecting foreign experiences, the advanced experiences of some counties and cooperatives cannot be implemented anywhere. For example, the experience of the party and government leading organs of Ping順County going to the countryside for mobile office work and deeply leading production, and the experience of the cadres of the Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xigou Township, Ping順County, regularly visiting the members, are rarely promoted in counties and cooperatives throughout the province because of this reason. There are also shortcomings in leadership style. There are more general calls and less specific organizational work and implementation measures. Many of the people organized to visit advanced units in many areas are general agricultural cadres, and very few party and government leading cadres participate. At the same time, the visit is not closely combined with the training and promotion of key personnel. When promoting a certain advanced experience, there is no clear plan, specific measures, quality requirements, and time limits, and no necessary responsibility system is established, which can easily lead to laissez-faire. For mature advanced experiences, they have not been vigorously promoted on the scale of mass movements. As a result, people who are sent to study advanced experiences lack a deep understanding of the main points and significance of the experiences, and are not clear enough about how to combine the specific characteristics of their regions to promote these experiences, so they are at a loss after returning to their original places. Practice has proved that leading cadres at all levels (especially the main responsible cadres) must personally summarize and lead the work of promoting advanced experiences, and cannot rely solely on business departments to carry out the work. If the leadership lacks a deep understanding of the main points of some advanced experiences, the various obstacles in the promotion process are not eliminated, and the strength of all parties is not mobilized under unified leadership, it is difficult to promote any advanced experience on a large scale.

　　Some areas have wavered in the process of promoting some advanced experiences and lack the determination to persevere to the end. For example, the experience of contracting work to households and contracting production to households in the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Chuandi, Ping順County, which was summarized as early as 1953, is a good way to put the operation and management of large and medium-sized agricultural cooperatives on the right track. After the key trial implementation in 1954, the effect was very good. However, at that time, the scale of many agricultural cooperatives was small, and the timing for universally promoting this experience was not fully mature. In 1956, the province realized agricultural collectivization, and the scale of agricultural cooperatives expanded and finalized, and it was fully equipped with the objective conditions for universally promoting the experience of contracting work to households and contracting production to households. However, people did not promote this experience. It is said that the method of labor quota management can replace this experience. However, practice has proved that only by implementing labor quota management, plus the experience of contracting work to households and contracting production to households, can the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives be put on the right track. Due to actual needs, this experience was not promoted again until 1957.

　　The lesson here is that any advanced experience should be carefully and specifically analyzed and studied. Neither should it be mechanically applied divorced from reality, nor should it be blindly rejected and completely negated. Some advanced experiences can complement each other and be comprehensively utilized.

　　New Measures
　　Shanxi Province has begun to take the following measures to overcome the above-mentioned biases. First, conduct production ranking and criticize the blind complacency ideology. The Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction has compiled detailed statistics on the rise and fall figures of agricultural output in each county in the past five years and compared the different output situations in the same conditions. It is prepared to inform various places so that everyone can face up to the unbalanced status quo of advanced and backward and fight against the conservative thinking that does not pay attention to advanced experiences and encourage the energy to realize a great leap forward in agricultural production. Second, organize leading cadres to visit advanced areas inside and outside the province to broaden their horizons. In the past three months, the province has organized more than 100 leading cadres above the county party committee secretary and county mayor to go to Henan Province, Hebei Province, and other places to learn from the experience of Jiyuan County in governing the Manghe River and the Tianjin Special Zone in controlling waterlogging by transforming depressions. After visiting, these leading cadres are determined to overcome the shortcomings of neglecting the summary and promotion of advanced experiences in the past. They came back to publicize these advanced experiences everywhere and put forward their opinions on promoting these experiences locally. Third, improve leadership methods and work style. The province is prepared to continue to cultivate advanced typical examples for realizing the various tasks stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), so as to expand the advanced experiences from points to areas and from areas to surfaces within the scope of the province. It is initially determined that the province will cultivate 5,000 new "Daquanshan" and "Yangjingdi" this year, transform 400,000 mu of low-lying land and saline-alkali wasteland, and focus on Lin County to cultivate typical examples of management by river basin (combining water conservancy and soil and water conservation); launch mass movements and widely use methods such as visits, training, competitions, evaluations, and professional meetings to spread advanced experiences, so as to change the barren landscape of barren land, drought, and lack of rain in northwest Shanxi at a faster rate. Leading cadres at all levels should personally participate in the work of promoting advanced experiences, use advanced methods to help the backward, so that the entire work can continue to overcome imbalances and continue to move forward.

    要使先进经验遍地开花
    ——山西省在推广农业先进经验中遇到的问题
    马明
    山西省已经出现的农村工作和生产建设方面的先进经验有二十多种，包括提高粮棉产量的技术经验、水土保持的经验、改良畜种的经验、四旁绿化的经验、巩固农业社经营管理的经验和深入领导大生产的经验等。这些经验大部分是经过长期培养、比较成熟的。
  两种做法
    推广先进经验的情况表明，两种不同的做法带来了不同的结果。一种是雁北地区推广大泉山
  （黄土丘陵区）水土保持经验的做法。这就是：首先认真地总结经验，肯定这个经验符合山区改造的规律。接着采取“全面布点、以点带面、重点领导、普遍开花”的方法，普遍推广这个经验。在推广的过程中，除以大泉山作榜样宣传建设山区的道理以外，更细致地进行了组织工作。比如在大泉山开办水土保持训练班，组织县、乡、社干部和积极农民到大泉山参观、学习，由大泉山派人到各地传播经验。这样，在各地就树立了学习大泉山的活榜样。各县、乡、社都制订学习大泉山的具体计划和实现措施。经过这一系列的努力，仅在一年多的时间内，这个地区就出现了乡乡有“大泉山”的奇迹，全区初步治理的荒山、沟壑面积占全区黄土丘陵区总面积的30％。
    另一种是推广平顺县羊井底（石山区）水土保持和长期全面规划的经验的做法。本来推广这个经验，对于从根本上改变占全省山区总面积51％的石山区的面貌、开发山区的丰富资源和增加山区农民收入，具有重大的意义。为了推广这个早在1953年总结的典型经验，过去举办过训练班，组织过参观。但是因为经验总结得不够具体明确，推广中又是一般的号召多、具体的组织领导少。因此，四年来，全省推广这个经验的寥寥无几。
    类似后一种做法的情况，在全省大部分地区普遍地存在着。比如太行山粮产区和晋南棉产区的一些增产粮棉的技术经验、隰县改良牛种的经验、夏县四旁绿化的经验和一些农业社经营管理上的经验，都发现、总结得比较早，可是推广得很不平衡，有些地区根本就没有推广。
    由于先进经验推广的迟缓，在农村工作中就出现了先进典型孤立、工作发展不平衡的状态。同时这也是全省粮棉产量上升缓慢的一个重要原因。现在全国都知道河南省济源县治理漭河“全面规划、综合治理”的经验，其实这个经验就是学习山西省阳高县治理大泉山的经验以后丰富起来的。湖北省麻城县普遍推广了山西省襄垣县农业社计划管理的经验——“一年早知道”，推广的效果比山西省其他县推广“一年早知道”的情况还要好得多。为什么这些先进经验在兄弟省能够很快开花结果，在本省和本县反而不容易推广？这里的原因是值得深思熟虑的。
    原因何在
    为什么各种先进典型经验不能迅速普遍推广？山西省农业领导机关反复地进行了研究。从领导思想来检查，原因首先是不少地区的领导机关对这些先进经验的重要内容和这些先进经验普遍推广以后在改变当地自然条件、促进农业增产上所起的巨大作用认识不明确。没有深切领会培养典型、普遍推广、推动落后、带动一般的原则，有些地区甚至不愿学习其他县、社的先进经验。这表现在有些地区忽视先进经验的认真总结和推广，对落后地区的状况了解得很少，帮助改进得不够。这就使先进社的工作热热闹闹，落后社冷冷清清。有人说：“别处的经验，我们这里也有，只是缺乏总结，总结了比他们的更好。”有些同志更以自己的客观困难来比别人的优越条件，说：“我们这个地方原来的底子很落后，自然条件又很坏，别处的经验虽然好，可是这里推广不了。”由于上述安于现状的保守主义和拒绝外地经验的思想作怪，致使一些县、社的先进经验无处推行。如平顺县党政领导机关下乡巡回办公、深入领导生产的经验，这个县西沟乡金星农林牧生产合作社干部定期访问社员的经验，就是因为这种原因，在全省各县、社里很少有推广的。在领导作风上也有缺点。一般的号召多，具体的组织工作和实现的措施少。许多地区的被组织到先进单位参观的人多是一般农业干部，党政领导干部很少参加。同时，参观没有和训练推广骨干密切结合。在推广某一项先进经验时，没有明确计划、具体措施、质量要求和时间限制，也没有建立必要的责任制，这就容易形成放任自流。对于成熟的先进经验，没有以群众运动的规模去大力推广。结果使派出学习先进经验的人对经验的要点意义缺少深刻了解，对如何结合本地区的具体特点推行这些经验不够明确，他们返回原地以后也就无所适从。实践证明，各级领导干部（特别是主要负责干部），必须亲自动手总结和领导推广先进经验的工作，而不能单纯依靠业务部门去进行。如果领导上对一些先进经验的要点缺乏深刻的理解，推广过程的各种障碍没有扫除，各方面的力量没有在统一的领导之下动员起来，任何先进经验都是很难大规模推广的。
    有些地区在推广有些先进经验的过程中动摇不定、缺乏坚持到底的决心。比如早在1953年总结的平顺县川底“五一”农业社包工包产的经验，是使大型、中型农业社经营管理走上正规的一种好办法。1954年重点试行以后，效果很好。但是当时许多农业社的规模小，普遍推广这种经验的时机还不完全成熟。1956年全省实现了农业合作化，农业社的规模扩大了，也定型了，完全具备了普遍推广包工包产经验的客观条件。可是人们却不推行这个经验了。据说劳动定额管理的办法可以代替这个经验。但是，实践证明：只有推行劳动定额管理，再加上采用包工包产经验，才会使农业社的经营管理走上正规。由于实际的需要，到1957年，这个经验才重新得到推广。
    这里的教训是：对待任何先进经验都应该认真地具体分析研究，既不能脱离实际的机械搬用，也不应该盲目地一概加以拒绝，否定全盘。某些先进经验是可以相互取长补短、加以综合利用的。
    新的措施
    山西省已经着手采取以下措施，克服上述偏向。首先进行生产排队，批判盲目自满思想。省农业建设厅已经详细统计了各县最近五年的农业产量升降数字，比较了同样条件下各地产量不同的情况，准备通报各地，以便使大家正视先进和落后不平衡的现状，同不重视先进经验的保守思想进行斗争，鼓起实现农业生产大跃进的干劲。第二、组织领导干部到省内外先进地区参观，开阔眼界。最近三个月内，全省已经组织县委书记、县长以上的领导干部一百多人，先后到河南省、河北省等地，通过参观，学习了济源县治理漭河和天津专区洼改治涝的经验。这些领导干部参观以后，决心克服过去忽视总结和推广先进经验的毛病。他们回来到处宣传这些先进经验，并且提出了在当地推广这些经验的意见。第三、改进领导方法和工作作风。全省准备继续培养实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定各项任务的先进典型，做到在全省范围内把先进经验由点扩大成片，由片连成面。初步确定全省今年要培养新的“大泉山”、“羊井底”五千个，改造低洼地、盐碱荒滩四十万亩，以临县为重点，培养按河系流域治理（水利和水土保持相结合）的典型；开展群众性的运动，广泛运用参观、训练、竞赛、评比、召开专业会议等方法传播先进经验，以较快的速度改变晋西北土地瘠薄、干旱缺雨的荒凉面貌。各级领导干部在推广先进经验工作中要亲自动手，运用先进帮助落后的办法，使整个工作在不断地克服不平衡，不断地前进。
