Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 4th — The Huangyan County Bureau of Military Service in Zhejiang Province recently issued a circular commending the militia in Pengjie Township and other areas who captured three Chiang Kai-shek air force personnel on November 5th of last year. It was also decided to grant material rewards to those with outstanding merit, such as Huang Jinkui.

The circular stated that when the Chiang Kai-shek plane that intruded into the airspace of Huangyan County on the night of November 5th was hit and crashed by our anti-aircraft artillery, the militia team of Pengjie Township, led by Huang Jinkui, immediately set out for the location where the enemy plane crashed. With the assistance of the militia from Sanjia, Shizhu, Xinshi and other townships, they resourcefully and bravely intercepted the three "air bandits" who were attempting to escape.

The circular pointed out that the capture of Chiang Kai-shek's air force personnel demonstrates the high level of vigilance of the militia in Pengjie and other townships. When they discovered that an enemy plane had intruded into the airspace and our anti-aircraft artillery was firing, they closely monitored the sky; when the Chiang Kai-shek plane was hit and crashed, they actively and quickly launched an encirclement, and with heroic and decisive actions forced Chiang Kai-shek's Major Wang Weiduo, the pilot, Major Kong Xiangzhang, the co-pilot, and Captain Li Fuquan, the navigator, to lay down their weapons and surrender.

    机智勇敢活捉蒋军飞行人员
    黄岩蓬街乡等地民兵受嘉奖
    新华社杭州4日电　浙江省黄岩县兵役局最近通报嘉奖在去年11月5日活捉蒋军空军人员三人的蓬街乡等地的民兵，并决定给予功绩显著的黄金魁等以物质奖励。
    通报说，11月5日夜间侵入黄岩县境上空的蒋军飞机被我高射炮部队击中坠落的时候，以黄金魁为首的蓬街乡民兵队，即迅速出动奔向敌机坠落的地点，他们在三甲、石柱、新市等乡民兵的协助下，机智勇敢地截获了三个企图逃遁的“飞贼”。
    通报指出，捕捉蒋军空军人员这一事实表明了蓬街等乡民兵的警惕性是很高的。他们在发现敌机侵入上空和我高射炮部队开炮射击的时候，就严密地监视上空；当蒋机被击中坠落时，即积极迅速地出动包抄，并且以英勇果断的动作迫使蒋军少校正驾驶员王为铎，少校副驾驶员孔祥璋，上尉领航官李复权等三人放下武器，俯首就俘。
