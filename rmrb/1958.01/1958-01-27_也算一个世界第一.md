Notes

    Following a series of accidents involving jet aircraft supplied by the United States to Japan, South Korea's jet aircraft obtained under US aid have also crashed consecutively. The first crash occurred on the 22nd during a US-ROK joint military exercise, and the second occurred in Gunsan. Why do such things happen? American arms dealers naturally know the secret. The problem is not that the United States cannot even make jet aircraft properly, but is using "US aid" to sell off old and substandard goods. The American business philosophy: regardless of the lives of allied pilots, making money is the only important thing, truly worthy of being called a world first.

    也算一个世界第一
    继美国供应日本的喷气式飞机不断发生事故之后，南朝鲜在美援项下得到的喷气飞机，又连续失事。第一次失事发生在22日的美李联合军事演习中，第二次失事发生在群山。为什么会有这样的事情呢？个中奥妙，美国的军火商自然晓得。问题并不在美国连喷气式飞机也造不成个样子，乃借“美援”推销陈货次品耳。美国的生意经：不管盟国飞行员的死活，赚钱就行，真也算得一个世界第一。
