Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, January 7th: The Guizhou Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has decided to build more than 310 new local specialty product processing groups and small-scale processing plants in mountainous areas this year to serve the development of these areas.

Guizhou Province is extremely rich in local specialty resources in its deep mountains. Initial statistics show there are more than 1,000 varieties, with an annual output value of approximately 98 million yuan. Due to inconvenient transportation and dispersed production in mountainous areas, it is relatively difficult to transport these products out. The establishment of these small-scale processing enterprises, which process raw materials into finished or semi-finished products, will facilitate transportation and play a significant role in developing mountainous area production. *Litsea cubeba*, produced throughout the province, is a raw material for producing high-grade aromatic oils, with an annual output of over 2 million jin. The 200 mobile processing groups planned this time can produce 100,000 jin of *Litsea cubeba* oil in a year. The three local product processing plants planned to be established in Jinping, Xingyi, and other counties will utilize locally abundant gum rosin, *Quercus fabri*, *Dioscorea opposita* and other resources to produce 210,000 jin of lampblack, turpentine, transparent rosin, and 60,000 jin of roasted adhesive annually. Wild plant oilseeds and bast fiber plants are also very common in various regions. In 1957 alone, 332 new species were discovered. The 77 wild oilseed and fiber processing groups that the province plans to establish this year can produce more than 1.7 million jin of oil annually, and can also produce large quantities of hemp rope and hemp sacks.

The 98 processing plants that the Guizhou Provincial Supply and Marketing departments have established in mountainous areas in recent years have played a significant role in promoting agricultural production in these areas. In the past two years alone, they have produced 52,000 pieces of agricultural implements and 4 million jin of granular fertilizer for farmers.

    发展山区经济　加工土特产品
    贵州省决定建立三百多个小型加工厂
    新华社贵阳7日电　贵州省供销合作社决定今年在山区新建三百一十多个土特产加工组和小型加工厂，为开发山区服务。
    贵州省深山中土特产资源十分丰富，初步统计有一千多种，年产总值约达九千八百多万元。由于山区交通不便，生产分散，外运比较困难。建立这批小型加工企业，把原料加工为成品或半成品，运输起来方便，对发展山区生产将起重大作用。全省各地出产的苍子是生产高级芳香油的原料，年产二百万斤以上，这次计划成立的二百个流动加工组，可以在一年内生产山苍子油十万斤。计划在锦屏、兴义等县建立的三个土产加工厂，利用当地盛产的毛松香、青杠树、薯良等，每年可生产松烟、松节油、透明松香等二十一万斤，烤胶六万斤。各地野生植物油料和麻类也很普遍，仅1957年就新发现三百三十二种，今年全省准备建立的七十七个野生油料、纤维加工组，每年可以生产油脂一百七十多万斤，另外还可以生产大量麻绳、麻袋。
    贵州省供销部门几年来在山区建立的九十八个加工厂，对促进山区农业生产起了很大作用。仅去年和前年就为农民生产五万二千件农具，四百万斤颗粒肥料。
