    Hitting Mountain Goats
    ——A Record of Winter Production in a Mountain Village Cooperative
    Zhang Zhimin
    Deep in the snowy mountains, the snowy path is long,
    Who is walking on the snowy path?
    Carrying medicine pots, shouldering fire guns,
    Dog-skin hats and sheepskin coats,
    Climbing mountains and crossing ridges as fast as flying,
    Like the "guerrilla group" of old,
    Going to ambush, going to "feel out the post."
    Not a guerrilla group, not going to feel out the post,
    It is the youth production team of the cooperative,
    Engaged in sideline production, hitting mountain goats,
    "Conceal! Conceal! Situation spotted…"
    "First group drive from the left, second group block from the right…."
    Who is commanding so well?
    Squad leader Yang Yigang,
    Was a squad leader in the People's Liberation Army,
    Look how brave the young man is!
    Leaping onto the cliff top,
    ——It’s a good place,
    Perfect for firing a gun,
    Bang! Bang! The gunshots ring out,
    Two mountain goats are wounded,
    "Quick! Quick! Quickly chase them…."
    Light a bonfire,
    Roast some dry rations,
    Even if the snowy day is cold,
    The young men's spirits are high,
    The firelight illuminates the sky red,
    Songs are spread on the snowy mountains,
    Who brought a pot of wine?
    "Drink! Drink comrades!
    To celebrate our great victory."
    The Propaganda Minister Ding Yan
    He is the propaganda minister of the county party committee,
    A cadre sent down to the township.
    When he came, he was obviously a novice,
    Now, he is no different from the peasants.
    He knows how much grain can be harvested from which plot of land,
    He knows how many baskets of fruit can be picked from which pear tree;
    He knows that the Zhang family is short of oil today,
    He knows that the Li family needs help writing a letter tomorrow.
    The girl Xiao Gui Xiang in the opposite room,
    Secretly fell in love with cooperative member Liu Yongxiang,
    She is shy and dare not tell her family,
    So she has to stammer and go to the minister….
    When he came, the cooperative members gave him unfamiliar looks,
    Now, everyone calls him "Old Wang" when they see him.

    打山羊
    ——记山村社冬季生产
    张志民雪山深，雪路长，是什么人走在雪路上？背着药壶，扛着火枪，狗皮帽子羊皮袄，爬山越岭飞一样，像是当年“游击组”，去打伏击去“摸岗”。不是游击组，不是去摸岗，是社里的青年生产组，副业生产打山羊，“隐蔽！隐蔽！发现情况……第一组从左边赶，第二组从右边挡……。”是谁指挥得这么棒？队长杨义刚，解放军里当过班长，你看小伙子多勇敢？纵身跳在崖头上，——是个好地方，正好儿开枪，砰！砰！枪声响，两只山羊受了伤，“快！快！快撵上……。”烧起篝火，烤烤干粮，哪怕雪天冷，小伙子情绪旺，火光照得天色红，歌儿传在雪山上，是谁带来了一壶酒？“喝吧！喝吧同志们！为庆祝咱们的大胜仗。”宣传部长　丁燕他是县委的宣传部长，干部下派他来到乡。来时显然是一位生手，现在，却和农民没两样。他知道哪块地能打多少谷，他知道哪棵梨树能摘果几筐；他知道张家今天缺了油，他知道李家明天写信要帮忙。对面房的姑娘小桂香，偷偷地爱上了社员刘永祥，她羞怯的不敢向家里说，只好吞吞吐吐的找部长……。来时社员们投给他生疏的眼光，现在谁见了都喊他“老王”。
