The Asian-African Solidarity Conference resolutions on imperialism and others supported the just struggles of Asian and African countries and local people for independence and sovereignty. Brief annotations are provided below:

    Cameroon: Located between French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa, with an area of over 449,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 4.5 million. Cameroon was originally a German colony. During World War I, it was occupied and divided by the Anglo-French Allied forces and is now still under British and French "trusteeship," subjected to cruel rule and plunder. The Cameroon Progressive Democratic Organization has sent representatives to the United Nations several times to petition for autonomy and independence. Recently, Ernest Ouandié, Vice President of the Cameroon People's Union, warned that the Cameroonian people would not hesitate to engage in armed struggle to achieve national independence. If the United Nations fails to promote Cameroon's independence, "Cameroon will become another Algeria."

    Kenya: Located in the equatorial part of East Africa, with an area of over 580,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 6 million. In 1827, Britain invaded Kenya. In 1895, Britain declared Kenya the "East Africa Protectorate." In 1920, it was renamed the "Colony and Protectorate of Kenya."

    For over sixty years, the Kenyan people have struggled for national independence. After World War II, large-scale, organized mass movements arose. In 1952, a large-scale peasant movement broke out. The British colonial authorities carried out bloody suppression. According to the colonial authorities' published, clearly reduced figures, from October 1952 to the end of 1955, over 10,000 Kenyans were killed in combat alone, and by the end of September 1955, over 60,000 Kenyans were imprisoned.

    Uganda: Located west of Kenya, with an area of over 243,000 square kilometers and a population of over 5.4 million. The capital is Entebbe. Uganda was originally a powerful kingdom, which became a British protectorate at the end of the nineteenth century.

    After World War II, the Ugandan people widely launched struggles for independence and against colonialism. In 1952, the Uganda National Congress Party was established to lead the struggle. It sent a delegation to London in June 1955 to present a memorandum to Britain demanding political independence. In April 1956 and May 1957, the Ugandan people repeatedly launched movements demanding autonomy. The British government was forced in October of last year to accept Uganda's demand for direct elections in 1958, but it still refused to grant autonomy.

    Chad: A region in French Equatorial Africa, south of Libya, with an area of over 1.1 million square kilometers and a population of approximately 2.5 million. The capital is Fort-Lamy. In 1841, France occupied Equatorial Africa and subsequently established colonial rule. The people of Chad have long been engaged in a struggle for independence.

    Togo: Located between Ghana and French West Africa, with an area of over 88,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 1.5 million. In 1884, it became a German colony. In 1914, it was occupied and divided by Britain and France. Later, the League of Nations entrusted Britain and France to rule it. In 1946, the UN Trusteeship Council decided to continue the trusteeship by Britain and France separately. In December 1956, the UN General Assembly decided to formally incorporate the British-administered Togo into Ghana. The French-administered area has an area of 55,000 square kilometers and a population of over 1 million, and is still under French rule. France is attempting to annex it. The Togolese people have launched a struggle for national independence, and many patriotic individuals have been imprisoned. The 12th UN General Assembly passed a resolution to supervise the 1958 new legislative assembly elections in French Togo and to consider ending the trusteeship after the elections.

    Madagascar: Located southeast of the African continent, with an area of approximately 590,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 4.4 million. It is the fourth largest island in the world. In 1896, it became a French colony. In March 1947, the people of Madagascar rose up in resistance. The number of deaths under the French colonial authorities' frenzied suppression reached 90,000, and a large number of patriotic individuals are still in prison.

    Yemen: Located in the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula, with an area of approximately 195,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 5 million. In 1939, Britain forcibly occupied Aden, a territory of Yemen, and later placed the southern region of Yemen under its "protection," calling it the "Protectorate." Britain also continuously carried out barbaric armed aggression against Yemen. Yemen has been fighting to recover these territories.

    Arabian Gulf: The Arabian Gulf region is still subject to British rule and aggression. The Arab people in this region and on the Bahrain Islands are continuing to fight for the right to independence.

    Oman: Composed of the Sultanate of Muscat and the Imamate of Oman, located at the southeastern end of the Arabian Peninsula, with an area of over 212,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 550,000, mostly Arabs. Britain ruled Oman for over 100 years, and in 1951, it turned Oman into a protectorate.

    In 1913, the independent Imamate of Oman was established, refusing to recognize British rule. In 1920, the Sultanate of Muscat recognized the independence of Oman. However, in November 1955, Britain directed the Muscat Sultan's army to carry out armed attacks, re-establishing rule over the Imamate of Oman. In July 1957, the Arab tribal people in the Nizwa region launched an armed uprising, which was subjected to bloody suppression by the British army.

    Bahrain Islands: A sheikhdom under British "protection," a group of small islands in the Persian Gulf, located between the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia and the Qatar Peninsula, with a total area of over 550 square kilometers. The population is approximately 120,000, mostly Arabs. The Bahrain Islands are rich in oil, which has been plundered by Britain. In recent years, American oil companies have also become involved.

    West Irian: An indivisible part of Indonesian territory, connected to East Irian, which belongs to Australia; with an area of 412,800 square kilometers and a population of over 500,000. After Indonesia's independence, the Netherlands guaranteed the restoration of Indonesia's complete sovereignty, but it still forcibly occupies West Irian. Since 1954, Indonesia has been requesting the UN General Assembly to adopt a resolution to recover West Irian through negotiations, but without success. Now, Indonesia is launching a struggle to liberate West Irian outside the United Nations.

    Okinawa: Territory of Japan. Area of approximately 2,000 square kilometers, population of 800,000.

    Since the United States occupied Okinawa during World War II, it has been using it as a military base and attempting to occupy it for a long time. The people of Okinawa firmly demand to return to their motherland. In recent years, the Japanese people have unanimously demanded the return of Okinawa and have established organizations such as the "National Movement Liaison Council for Resolving the Okinawa Issue" to carry out the struggle.

    Cyprus: Located at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea, with an area of 9,262 square kilometers, with strategic importance. It was originally Greek territory. Now, 80% of the more than 500,000 residents on the island are Greeks. Since 1878, it has been a British colony. The people of Cyprus have launched a heroic struggle for national self-determination and union with Greece. The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly discussed the Cyprus issue, but without result. Britain not only continues to implement colonial rule there but also carries out bloody suppression.

    Goa: Historically territory of India, located on the west coast of the Indian peninsula, with an area of 3,370 square kilometers, and a population of approximately 600,000. Since Portugal forcibly occupied Goa in the early sixteenth century, it has refused to return it to India and has carried out bloody suppression of the Goan people's struggle for liberation and union with India.

    Korean Question: The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27, 1953. Article 60 of the agreement stipulates that within three months after the armistice, both sides should send representatives to convene a higher-level political conference to discuss issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. On October 26, the two sides held talks on the political conference in Panmunjom. However, the US side sabotaged the talks.

    In April 1954, the Geneva Conference discussed the resolution of the Korean question, but failed to reach an agreement due to US obstruction.

    The United States has also repeatedly forced through illegal resolutions in the United Nations General Assembly that are unfavorable to the resolution of the Korean question.

    Not only that, the United States signed a "Mutual Defense Treaty" with South Korea, expanded its military in South Korea, and in June 1957, it also violated the agreement by importing reinforcements and new weapons.

    Vietnam Question: In July 1954, the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina and the peaceful reunification of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. The agreement stipulated that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and South Vietnam should, one year later, i.e., from July 20, 1955, negotiate on the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and hold general elections under the supervision of the International Commission in July 1956. However, the South Vietnamese authorities, under the direction of the United States, refused to fulfill this provision. The South Vietnamese authorities accepted the US military advisory group and military assistance, and constantly violated the various provisions of the agreement.

    Gulf of Aqaba: A narrow gulf leading to the Red Sea, located between Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and Saudi Arabia. The gulf is 100 miles long, with small portions along the coasts of Jordan and Israel. At the entrance to the Red Sea are two small islands called Tiran and Sanafir. After the failure of the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, Israel demanded that "guaranteeing" the "freedom of navigation" in the Gulf of Aqaba be one of the conditions for withdrawing its troops. The United States also insisted that the Gulf of Aqaba was an "international waterway," supporting Israel and attempting to take the opportunity to control the Gulf of Aqaba. However, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have firmly opposed this, repeatedly declaring that the Gulf of Aqaba constitutes a part of their territorial waters, and they are determined to uphold their rights to the Gulf of Aqaba.

    Morocco: After gaining independence on March 2, 1956, the Moroccan people continued to strive for unification and complete independence. An indivisible part of its territory, Ifni, with an area of over 700 square miles and a population of approximately 20,000, is still under Spanish occupation. In late November 1957, the people of Ifni launched an armed uprising, demanding to break free from Spanish colonial rule and return to Morocco.

    Somaliland: Located at the tip of East Africa, with an area of over 710,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 2 million. In the nineteenth century, Somaliland was divided by Britain, France, and Italy. During World War II, Britain occupied Italian Somaliland. After the war, the UN General Assembly returned the former Italian Somaliland to Italy for a ten-year trusteeship, until 1960. All political parties in Somaliland are united around the Somaliland National Front, striving for the unification and independence of Somaliland.

    Algeria: Located between Tunisia and Morocco, with an area of over 2 million square kilometers and a population of approximately 10 million. The Algerian people launched an armed uprising for independence and freedom on November 1, 1954. Over the past three years, the uprising forces have grown from 3,000 to 100,000. The national liberation movement has swept the country.

    Palestinian Refugee Problem: In May 1948, imperialism provoked the year-long Palestinian War. Israeli Zionists occupied Arab-inhabited areas, causing nearly one million Arabs to leave their homes and become displaced. The United Nations General Assembly, at the request of the Soviet Union, made a resolution on enabling refugees to return to their homes, but it has not been implemented to date. The United States is using this issue to carry out divisive and aggressive activities.

    Racial Discrimination: Racial discrimination is most severe in the Union of South Africa. The Union of South Africa is located at the southernmost tip of the African continent, with an area of over 1.2 million square kilometers and a population of over 13 million. It became a British colony in the nineteenth century. In 1910, the Union of South Africa was established, becoming a self-governing dominion of Britain. For decades, racial discrimination has been prevalent here, with the enactment of various laws, such as the "Apartheid Act," the "Population Registration Act," the "Urban Areas Act," the "Pass Laws," the "Native Resettlement Act," the "Group Areas Act," and the "Native Labour Legislation," depriving Africans and other people of color, who make up four-fifths of the population, of the right to migrate and choose residences, choose occupations, marry, and enjoy social life, which has been universally condemned by world public opinion.

    亚非团结大会决议的注释
    亚非团结大会关于帝国主义和其他决议，支持了亚非国家和地方人民争取独立主权的正义斗争。现作简要的注释如下：
    喀麦隆　位于法属西非洲和法属赤道非洲之间，面积四十四万九千多平方公里，人口约有四百五十多万。喀麦隆原是德国殖民地。在第一次世界大战期中，被英法联军占领和分割，现在仍在英法分别“托管”下，受到残酷的统治和掠夺。喀麦隆进步民主组织曾几次派代表到联合国请愿，要求给予自治和独立。不久前喀麦隆人民联盟副主席欧内斯特·乌安迪警告说，喀麦隆人民将不惜进行武装斗争来争取民族独立。如果联合国不能促进喀麦隆获得独立，“喀麦隆就将成为另一个阿尔及利亚”。
    怯尼亚　位于非洲东部的赤道部分，面积五十八万多平方公里，人口约六百万人。1827年英国侵入怯尼亚，1895年宣布怯尼亚为“东非保护国”，1920年改称“怯尼亚殖民地和保护国”。
    六十多年来，怯尼亚人民一直为争取民族独立而斗争。二次世界大战后，兴起了大规模的有组织的群众运动。1952年爆发了大规模的农民运动。英国殖民当局进行血腥的镇压。据殖民当局发表的显然缩小的数字，从1952年10月到1955年年底，仅在战斗中被杀的怯尼亚人便有一万余名，1955年9月底被囚禁的怯尼亚人有六万多名。
    乌干达　位于怯尼亚之西，面积二十四万三千多平方公里，人口五百四十多万，首都为恩德培。乌干达原是一个强盛的王国，于十九世纪末沦为英国的保护国。
    第二次世界大战后，乌干达人民广泛展开要求独立和反对殖民主义的斗争。1952年乌干达国民大会党成立，领导斗争，曾于1955年6月派代表团到伦敦，向英国提出要求政治独立的备忘录。1956年4月和1957年5月，乌干达人民一再展开要求自治的运动。英国政府在去年10月被迫接受了乌干达在1958年举行直接选举的要求，但仍拒绝给予自治。
    乍得　法属赤道非洲中的一个地区，在利比亚南部，面积一百一十多万平方公里，人口约二百五十万，首府拉密寨。1841年法国占领了赤道非洲，随即建立了殖民统治。乍得人民长时期以来进行着争取独立的斗争。
    多哥　位于加纳和法属西非洲之间，面积八万八千多平方公里，人口约一百五十万。1884年沦为德国殖民地，1914年被英法占领并瓜分。后来国联委任英法统治。1946年联合国托管委员会决定继续分别由英法两国托管。1956年12月，联大决定正式将多哥英托管区并入加纳。法属托管区面积为五万五千平方公里，人口一百多万，至今仍在法国统治下。法国并企图予以吞并。多哥人民展开了争取民族独立的斗争，许多爱国志士遭到监禁。十二届联大通过了对法属多哥1958年新立法议会选举进行监督和选举后考虑结束托管的决议。
    马达加斯加　位于非洲大陆的东南，面积约五十九万平方公里，人口约四百四十多万，是世界第四大岛。1896年沦为法国殖民地。1947年3月马达加斯加人民奋起反抗，在法国殖民当局疯狂镇压下死亡的人数达九万，大批爱国志士至今仍在监牢里。
    也门　位于阿拉伯半岛西南部，面积约十九万五千平方公里，人口约五百万。1939年英国强占了也门的领土亚丁，以后又把也门南部地区置于它的“保护”下，称为“保护地”。英国还不断对也门进行野蛮的武装侵略。也门一直为收复这些领土而斗争。
    阿拉伯海湾　阿拉伯海湾地区至今仍受到英国的统治和侵略。这个地区和巴林群岛上的阿拉伯人民正在继续争取独立权利。
    阿曼是由马斯喀特苏丹国和阿曼伊斯兰教长国组成的，位于阿拉伯半岛的东南端，面积有二十一万二千多平方公里，人口约五十五万，大部分是阿拉伯人。英国统治了阿曼一百多年，1951年把阿曼变为保护国。
    1913年阿曼成立了独立的阿曼伊斯兰教长国，不承认英国的统治。1920年马斯喀特苏丹国承认阿曼的独立。但是，1955年11月英国指挥马斯喀特苏丹军队实行武装进攻，重建了对阿曼伊斯兰教长国的统治。1957年7月，尼兹瓦地区的阿拉伯部落人民举行了武装起义，受到英军的血腥镇压。
    巴林群岛是在英国“保护”下的酋长国，是波斯湾中的一群小岛，位于沙特阿拉伯东沿海岸和卡塔尔半岛之间，总面积为五百五十多平方公里。人口约十二万，绝大部分是阿拉伯人。巴林群岛盛产石油，一直受到英国的掠夺，近年来美国石油公司也插手进去。
    西伊里安　印度尼西亚领土不可分割的部分，同澳大利亚所属的东伊里安相连；面积有四十一万二千八百平方公里，人口约五十多万。印度尼西亚独立后，荷兰曾保证恢复印度尼西亚的完全主权，但至今仍强占西伊里安。1954年以来，印度尼西亚一直在联合国大会要求通过谈判收回西伊里安，但没有结果。现在印度尼西亚正在展开在联合国外争取解放西伊里安的斗争。
    冲绳岛　日本的领土。面积约二千平方公里，人口八十万。
    美国自从在第二次大战时期占领冲绳之后，一直把它作为一个军事基地，并企图长期占据。冲绳人民坚决要求归回祖国。几年来日本人民一致要求收回冲绳，并成立了“解决冲绳问题国民运动联络会议”等组织进行斗争。
    塞浦路斯　位于地中海东端，面积有九千二百六十二平方公里，具有战略地位。它原是希腊的领土，现在岛上的五十多万居民，有80％是希腊人。1878年沦为英国殖民地。塞浦路斯人民为争取民族自决并归并于希腊，展开了英勇的斗争。联合国大会一再讨论了塞浦路斯问题，但未有结果。英国不仅在那里继续实行殖民统治，并且进行血腥镇压。
    果阿　向来是印度的领土，位于印度半岛的西海岸，面积三千三百七十平方公里，人口约六十万。自十六世纪初叶葡萄牙以武力占领果阿后，至今仍拒绝把它归还印度，还对果阿人民要求解放归并印度的斗争进行血腥镇压。
    朝鲜问题　1953年7月27日签订朝鲜停战协定。协定第六十款规定停战后三个月内双方应分派代表召开双方高一级的政治会议，协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题。10月26日双方曾在板门店举行关于政治会议的双方会谈。但美方破坏了双方会谈。
    1954年4月，日内瓦会议讨论过解决朝鲜问题，也因美国的阻挠，未能达成协议。
    美国还在联合国大会上一再强行通过不利于朝鲜问题解决的非法决议。
    不仅如此，美国同南朝鲜签订了“共同防御条约”，在南朝鲜扩充军备，1957年6月还破坏协定输入增援性武器和新式武器。
    越南问题　1954年7月，日内瓦会议达成了关于停止印度支那战争和使柬埔寨、老挝、越南三国和平统一的协议。协议规定越南民主共和国和南越方面应在一年以后、即1955年7月20日起就越南和平统一的问题进行协商，于1956年7月内在国际委员会的监督下举行普选。但南越当局在美国指使下拒绝履行这个规定。南越当局接受美国军事顾问团和军事援助，并不断破坏协定的各项条款。
    亚喀巴湾　是通红海的一条狭长海湾，介于埃及的西奈半岛和沙特阿拉伯之间，海湾长一百英里，有小部分在约旦和以色列的沿岸。通红海的出口处，有两个小岛叫蒂朗和塞纳菲尔岛。英法以侵埃战争失败后，以色列曾要求以“保证”亚喀巴湾的“航行自由”作为撤军的条件之一。美国也硬说亚喀巴湾是一条“国际水道”，支持以色列，企图乘机控制亚喀巴湾。但是，埃及和沙特阿拉伯都坚决反对，一再声明亚喀巴湾是构成阿拉伯领海的一部分，它们决心维护它们对亚喀巴湾的权利。
    摩洛哥　1956年3月2日获得独立后，摩洛哥人民继续争取统一和完全独立。它的领土不可分割的一部分，伊夫尼，面积有七百多平方英里，居民约二万人，仍在西班牙占领下。1957年11月下旬，伊夫尼人民爆发武装起义，要求摆脱西班牙的殖民统治，归还摩洛哥。
    索马里兰　位于非洲东部尖端地带，面积七十一万多平方公里，人口约二百万。十九世纪索马里兰为英、法、意三国瓜分。二次大战期间，英国占领了意属索马里兰。战后，联大把前意属索马里兰仍交给意大利托管十年，到1960年为止。索马里兰所有的政党都团结在索马里兰民族阵线的周围，争取索马里兰的统一和独立。
    阿尔及利亚　位于突尼斯和摩洛哥之间，面积有二百多万平方公里，人口约一千万。阿尔及利亚人民在1954年11月1日爆发了争取独立自由的武装起义。三年来，起义部队由三千人壮大到十万人。民族解放运动席卷了全国。
    巴勒斯坦难民问题　1948年5月，帝国主义挑起了为期一年的巴勒斯坦战争。以色列犹太复国主义者占领了阿拉伯人居住的地区，使得近百万的阿拉伯人背乡弃井，流离失所。联合国大会曾在苏联要求下作出了关于使难民重返家园的决议，但至今未能执行。美国正在利用这个问题进行分化和侵略活动。
    种族歧视　种族歧视在南非联邦最为严重。南非联邦位于非洲大陆最南端，面积约一百二十多万平方公里，人口约一千三百多万。十九世纪就成为英国殖民地。1910年南非联邦成立，成为英国的一个自治领。几十年来，这里一直盛行着种族歧视，制定各种法令，如“种族隔离法”、“人口登记法”、“城市地区法”、“通行证法”、“土著迁居法”、“特定住区法”、“土著劳动立法”等，剥夺了占人口五分之四的非洲人及其它有色人种的迁居和选择居住地、选择职业、通婚和社会生活上的权利和自由，遭到世界舆论的普遍谴责。
