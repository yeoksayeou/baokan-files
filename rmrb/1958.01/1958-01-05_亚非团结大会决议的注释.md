The Asian-African Solidarity Conference resolutions on imperialism and others supported the just struggles of Asian and African countries and local people for independence and sovereignty. Brief annotations are provided below:

    Cameroon: Located between French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa, with an area of over 449,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 4.5 million. Cameroon was originally a German colony. During World War I, it was occupied and divided by the Anglo-French Allied forces and is now still under British and French "trusteeship," subjected to cruel rule and plunder. The Cameroon Progressive Democratic Organization has sent representatives to the United Nations several times to petition for autonomy and independence. Recently, Ernest Ouandi√©, Vice President of the Cameroon People's Union, warned that the Cameroonian people would not hesitate to engage in armed struggle to achieve national independence. If the United Nations fails to promote Cameroon's independence, "Cameroon will become another Algeria."

    Kenya: Located in the equatorial part of East Africa, with an area of over 580,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 6 million. In 1827, Britain invaded Kenya. In 1895, Britain declared Kenya the "East Africa Protectorate." In 1920, it was renamed the "Colony and Protectorate of Kenya."

    For over sixty years, the Kenyan people have struggled for national independence. After World War II, large-scale, organized mass movements arose. In 1952, a large-scale peasant movement broke out. The British colonial authorities carried out bloody suppression. According to the colonial authorities' published, clearly reduced figures, from October 1952 to the end of 1955, over 10,000 Kenyans were killed in combat alone, and by the end of September 1955, over 60,000 Kenyans were imprisoned.

    Uganda: Located west of Kenya, with an area of over 243,000 square kilometers and a population of over 5.4 million. The capital is Entebbe. Uganda was originally a powerful kingdom, which became a British protectorate at the end of the nineteenth century.

    After World War II, the Ugandan people widely launched struggles for independence and against colonialism. In 1952, the Uganda National Congress Party was established to lead the struggle. It sent a delegation to London in June 1955 to present a memorandum to Britain demanding political independence. In April 1956 and May 1957, the Ugandan people repeatedly launched movements demanding autonomy. The British government was forced in October of last year to accept Uganda's demand for direct elections in 1958, but it still refused to grant autonomy.

    Chad: A region in French Equatorial Africa, south of Libya, with an area of over 1.1 million square kilometers and a population of approximately 2.5 million. The capital is Fort-Lamy. In 1841, France occupied Equatorial Africa and subsequently established colonial rule. The people of Chad have long been engaged in a struggle for independence.

    Togo: Located between Ghana and French West Africa, with an area of over 88,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 1.5 million. In 1884, it became a German colony. In 1914, it was occupied and divided by Britain and France. Later, the League of Nations entrusted Britain and France to rule it. In 1946, the UN Trusteeship Council decided to continue the trusteeship by Britain and France separately. In December 1956, the UN General Assembly decided to formally incorporate the British-administered Togo into Ghana. The French-administered area has an area of 55,000 square kilometers and a population of over 1 million, and is still under French rule. France is attempting to annex it. The Togolese people have launched a struggle for national independence, and many patriotic individuals have been imprisoned. The 12th UN General Assembly passed a resolution to supervise the 1958 new legislative assembly elections in French Togo and to consider ending the trusteeship after the elections.

    Madagascar: Located southeast of the African continent, with an area of approximately 590,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 4.4 million. It is the fourth largest island in the world. In 1896, it became a French colony. In March 1947, the people of Madagascar rose up in resistance. The number of deaths under the French colonial authorities' frenzied suppression reached 90,000, and a large number of patriotic individuals are still in prison.

    Yemen: Located in the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula, with an area of approximately 195,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 5 million. In 1939, Britain forcibly occupied Aden, a territory of Yemen, and later placed the southern region of Yemen under its "protection," calling it the "Protectorate." Britain also continuously carried out barbaric armed aggression against Yemen. Yemen has been fighting to recover these territories.

    Arabian Gulf: The Arabian Gulf region is still subject to British rule and aggression. The Arab people in this region and on the Bahrain Islands are continuing to fight for the right to independence.

    Oman: Composed of the Sultanate of Muscat and the Imamate of Oman, located at the southeastern end of the Arabian Peninsula, with an area of over 212,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 550,000, mostly Arabs. Britain ruled Oman for over 100 years, and in 1951, it turned Oman into a protectorate.

    In 1913, the independent Imamate of Oman was established, refusing to recognize British rule. In 1920, the Sultanate of Muscat recognized the independence of Oman. However, in November 1955, Britain directed the Muscat Sultan's army to carry out armed attacks, re-establishing rule over the Imamate of Oman. In July 1957, the Arab tribal people in the Nizwa region launched an armed uprising, which was subjected to bloody suppression by the British army.

    Bahrain Islands: A sheikhdom under British "protection," a group of small islands in the Persian Gulf, located between the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia and the Qatar Peninsula, with a total area of over 550 square kilometers. The population is approximately 120,000, mostly Arabs. The Bahrain Islands are rich in oil, which has been plundered by Britain. In recent years, American oil companies have also become involved.

    West Irian: An indivisible part of Indonesian territory, connected to East Irian, which belongs to Australia; with an area of 412,800 square kilometers and a population of over 500,000. After Indonesia's independence, the Netherlands guaranteed the restoration of Indonesia's complete sovereignty, but it still forcibly occupies West Irian. Since 1954, Indonesia has been requesting the UN General Assembly to adopt a resolution to recover West Irian through negotiations, but without success. Now, Indonesia is launching a struggle to liberate West Irian outside the United Nations.

    Okinawa: Territory of Japan. Area of approximately 2,000 square kilometers, population of 800,000.

    Since the United States occupied Okinawa during World War II, it has been using it as a military base and attempting to occupy it for a long time. The people of Okinawa firmly demand to return to their motherland. In recent years, the Japanese people have unanimously demanded the return of Okinawa and have established organizations such as the "National Movement Liaison Council for Resolving the Okinawa Issue" to carry out the struggle.

    Cyprus: Located at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea, with an area of 9,262 square kilometers, with strategic importance. It was originally Greek territory. Now, 80% of the more than 500,000 residents on the island are Greeks. Since 1878, it has been a British colony. The people of Cyprus have launched a heroic struggle for national self-determination and union with Greece. The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly discussed the Cyprus issue, but without result. Britain not only continues to implement colonial rule there but also carries out bloody suppression.

    Goa: Historically territory of India, located on the west coast of the Indian peninsula, with an area of 3,370 square kilometers, and a population of approximately 600,000. Since Portugal forcibly occupied Goa in the early sixteenth century, it has refused to return it to India and has carried out bloody suppression of the Goan people's struggle for liberation and union with India.

    Korean Question: The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27, 1953. Article 60 of the agreement stipulates that within three months after the armistice, both sides should send representatives to convene a higher-level political conference to discuss issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. On October 26, the two sides held talks on the political conference in Panmunjom. However, the US side sabotaged the talks.

    In April 1954, the Geneva Conference discussed the resolution of the Korean question, but failed to reach an agreement due to US obstruction.

    The United States has also repeatedly forced through illegal resolutions in the United Nations General Assembly that are unfavorable to the resolution of the Korean question.

    Not only that, the United States signed a "Mutual Defense Treaty" with South Korea, expanded its military in South Korea, and in June 1957, it also violated the agreement by importing reinforcements and new weapons.

    Vietnam Question: In July 1954, the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina and the peaceful reunification of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. The agreement stipulated that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and South Vietnam should, one year later, i.e., from July 20, 1955, negotiate on the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and hold general elections under the supervision of the International Commission in July 1956. However, the South Vietnamese authorities, under the direction of the United States, refused to fulfill this provision. The South Vietnamese authorities accepted the US military advisory group and military assistance, and constantly violated the various provisions of the agreement.

    Gulf of Aqaba: A narrow gulf leading to the Red Sea, located between Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and Saudi Arabia. The gulf is 100 miles long, with small portions along the coasts of Jordan and Israel. At the entrance to the Red Sea are two small islands called Tiran and Sanafir. After the failure of the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, Israel demanded that "guaranteeing" the "freedom of navigation" in the Gulf of Aqaba be one of the conditions for withdrawing its troops. The United States also insisted that the Gulf of Aqaba was an "international waterway," supporting Israel and attempting to take the opportunity to control the Gulf of Aqaba. However, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have firmly opposed this, repeatedly declaring that the Gulf of Aqaba constitutes a part of their territorial waters, and they are determined to uphold their rights to the Gulf of Aqaba.

    Morocco: After gaining independence on March 2, 1956, the Moroccan people continued to strive for unification and complete independence. An indivisible part of its territory, Ifni, with an area of over 700 square miles and a population of approximately 20,000, is still under Spanish occupation. In late November 1957, the people of Ifni launched an armed uprising, demanding to break free from Spanish colonial rule and return to Morocco.

    Somaliland: Located at the tip of East Africa, with an area of over 710,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 2 million. In the nineteenth century, Somaliland was divided by Britain, France, and Italy. During World War II, Britain occupied Italian Somaliland. After the war, the UN General Assembly returned the former Italian Somaliland to Italy for a ten-year trusteeship, until 1960. All political parties in Somaliland are united around the Somaliland National Front, striving for the unification and independence of Somaliland.

    Algeria: Located between Tunisia and Morocco, with an area of over 2 million square kilometers and a population of approximately 10 million. The Algerian people launched an armed uprising for independence and freedom on November 1, 1954. Over the past three years, the uprising forces have grown from 3,000 to 100,000. The national liberation movement has swept the country.

    Palestinian Refugee Problem: In May 1948, imperialism provoked the year-long Palestinian War. Israeli Zionists occupied Arab-inhabited areas, causing nearly one million Arabs to leave their homes and become displaced. The United Nations General Assembly, at the request of the Soviet Union, made a resolution on enabling refugees to return to their homes, but it has not been implemented to date. The United States is using this issue to carry out divisive and aggressive activities.

    Racial Discrimination: Racial discrimination is most severe in the Union of South Africa. The Union of South Africa is located at the southernmost tip of the African continent, with an area of over 1.2 million square kilometers and a population of over 13 million. It became a British colony in the nineteenth century. In 1910, the Union of South Africa was established, becoming a self-governing dominion of Britain. For decades, racial discrimination has been prevalent here, with the enactment of various laws, such as the "Apartheid Act," the "Population Registration Act," the "Urban Areas Act," the "Pass Laws," the "Native Resettlement Act," the "Group Areas Act," and the "Native Labour Legislation," depriving Africans and other people of color, who make up four-fifths of the population, of the right to migrate and choose residences, choose occupations, marry, and enjoy social life, which has been universally condemned by world public opinion.
