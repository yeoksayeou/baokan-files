    Dangerous Signal
    By our commentator
    In a report submitted on the 25th, Senator Green, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, demanded that NATO countries must “spend more money” to step up the arms race. Although Green's report was written based on the results of his investigation trip last fall, its publication is undoubtedly intended to cooperate with the current arms expansion and war preparation policy of the U.S. ruling group and to exert pressure on European countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    Recently, due to the Soviet Union's continuous peace proposals, public opinion in various countries around the world, including European countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has generally demanded that a summit meeting of Eastern and Western countries be held to eliminate the "Cold War" and the arms race. This call has formed a strong pressure on the governments of NATO countries, thus becoming a major obstacle to the United States' promotion of its arms expansion and war preparation policy. The NATO summit in December last year, and the subsequent repeated inclusion of the issue of replying to Bulganin's letter as a major agenda item by the group's Standing Council, disrupting the U.S.'s pace of forcing other countries in the group to step up arms expansion and war preparation, is the best proof. The U.S. ruling group is, of course, very distressed by this situation.
    Ignoring the current situation and the wishes of the people of various countries, Green demanded that NATO continue to step up arms expansion and war preparation in the coming years. He particularly emphasized that West Germany must "immediately" make "full contributions" in this regard, and that the issue should be discussed by the NATO Council, not the United States alone, with West Germany. At the same time, he also advocated accelerating the resolution of the so-called Algerian issue so that France could free itself up and allow NATO to "fully exert its strength." For Turkey, which has fallen into a "financial crisis," Green advocated using the U.S. military aid fund to subsidize its war preparation plan. Green's report clearly shows the U.S. ruling group's eagerness to stir up a frenzy of war preparation in Europe and the Middle East.
    However, people can see from Green's report that the U.S. ruling group faces considerable difficulties in promoting its crazy plan. Not to mention how incompatible this crazy plan is with the peaceful wishes of the people of various countries. Taking the situation of the governments of NATO countries as an example, the policy of stepping up arms expansion and war preparation will make them face the so-called "economic problems caused by full defense," which even Green cannot but acknowledge. In fact, even West Germany, which has a relatively good economic situation, has seen its financial situation deteriorate due to the substantial increase in military spending last year. Not to mention those countries with very difficult economic conditions. As for the so-called proposal to accelerate the resolution of the Algerian issue, this is just a trick by the U.S. monopoly groups to try to replace France. The exposure of U.S. ambitions in Algeria will only deepen the contradictions between the U.S. and France, and will not be conducive to the U.S.'s arms expansion and war preparation policy.
    However, people cannot ignore the dangerous nature of the U.S.'s crazy plan. First of all, the policy of arms expansion and war preparation is completely contrary to the path of seeking to eliminate the "Cold War" and the arms race through East-West talks; secondly, it will bring extremely serious consequences to the Western European countries that implement this policy. Therefore, Green's report is a dangerous signal for Western European countries. The people of all countries, especially the people of Western European countries, must be vigilant about this crazy trend of the U.S. ruling group as shown in Green's report.

    危险的信号
    本报评论员
    美国参议院外交委员会主席格林在25日提出的一个报告中，要求北大西洋集团国家必须“花更多的钱”，来加紧进行扩军备战。格林的这个报告虽然是根据他去年秋季旅行调查的结果而写成的，但是，它的发表，却无疑是为了配合美国统治集团当前的扩军备战政策，来向北大西洋集团的欧洲国家施加压力。
    最近以来，由于苏联不断提出和平建议，世界各国，包括北大西洋集团的欧洲国家的舆论，普遍要求举行东西方国家最高级会议，来消除“冷战”和军备竞赛。这种呼声已对北大西洋集团国家的政府形成了强大的压力，从而也就成为美国推行扩军备战政策的一个重大的阻碍。去年12月的北大西洋集团最高级会议，以及以后这个集团的常务理事会不得不屡次把答复布尔加宁的信件的问题列为主要议程，从而打乱了美国迫使这个集团的其他国家加紧扩军备战的步调，就是最好的证明。这种情况，美国统治集团当然是十分苦恼的。
    格林完全不顾目前的局势和各国人民的愿望，要求北大西洋集团在今后几年内继续加紧扩军备战。他特别强调必须使西德“立刻”在这方面“作出充分的贡献”，并且应当由北大西洋集团理事会，而不是美国单独同西德讨论这个问题。同时，他还主张加速解决所谓阿尔及利亚问题，以便法国能够抽身出来，使北大西洋集团“充分发挥它的力量”。对于已陷入“财政危机”的土耳其，格林主张用美国的军事援助基金来资助它进行备战计划。格林的报告显然表现了美国统治集团力图在欧洲和中东掀起一股备战狂潮的急不可待的心情。
    可是，人们从格林的报告中就可以看出，美国统治集团在推行它的这种疯狂计划的道路上有着不小的困难。且不说，这种疯狂的计划与各国人民的和平愿望是何等的不能相容。就以北大西洋集团各国政府的处境来说，加紧扩军备战的政策将使它们面对连格林也不能不承认的所谓“由于充分防御而引起的经济问题”。事实上，就是经济情况较好的西德，由于去年大大增加了军事开支，以致财政状况呈现出不妙的景象。更不用说那些经济十分困难的国家了。至于，所谓加速解决阿尔及利亚问题的主张，这只不过是美国垄断集团企图取法国而代之的一种手法而已。美国对阿尔及利亚的野心的暴露，只会加深美法之间的矛盾，而不会有利于美国的扩军备战政策。
    但是，人们也不能忽视美国的疯狂计划的危险性质。首先，扩军备战的政策是与东西方会谈谋求消除“冷战”和军备竞赛的道路完全背道而驰的；其次，它将为执行这种政策的西欧国家带来极其严重的后果。因此，格林的报告对于西欧国家来说，是一个危险的信号。各国人民、特别是西欧国家的人民，不能不警惕格林报告所表现出的美国统治集团的这种疯狂动向。
