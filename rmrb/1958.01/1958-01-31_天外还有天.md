    There is Always a Higher Heaven
    By Fan Rongkang, our reporter

    An Advanced Factory with 19th-Century Features
    Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory is one of the advanced factories among the national railway vehicle repair factories, and it is also one of the most famous model factories in Shijiazhuang City and Hebei Province. Many of their production indicators rank among the top in similar factories nationwide.

    Before arriving in Shijiazhuang, I had heard that the Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory was an old factory with simple workshops and backward equipment. But unless you are there in person, it's hard to imagine how simple the factory buildings are and how backward the equipment is. Here, 80% to 85% of the entire freight car repair process, from dismantling to assembly, is carried out in the open air. In previous years, to improve working conditions, some protective sheds were built. In summer, these could block the sun, but once it reached late autumn and early winter, in order to prevent the sheds from collapsing under the weight of snow, they had to be dismantled, and the workers produced in the biting cold wind. Only a few days before the reporter arrived at the factory, the Ministry of Railways allocated 110,000 yuan to allow them to build some sheds covered with iron sheets, saving them from the hardship of operating in the snow. But these iron sheet sheds have no bricks or wood on the four walls, except for a few iron frames supporting the roof, and they are not much better than working in the open air. Moreover, even after this improvement, some mat-shed workshops remain. In addition, there are workshops made from scrapped vehicle wooden shells.

    As for the machinery and equipment, it is even worse. Walking into the machine shop, you can see belts hanging from the line shafts. It turns out there are still many old-fashioned belt lathes here. According to Deputy Director Fan Yuqi, only one imported new machine has been added since liberation, and the other equipment added due to production development has mostly been transferred from old machines from fraternal factories.

    This old factory with 19th-century features is indeed "unimpressive" in every way. Some people once considered scrapping the factory and building a new factory on a new site. But the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the factory cadres felt it would be a waste to scrap it, and raised objections, allowing it to continue to survive. Who would have known that this dilapidated and old factory would be ahead of its fraternal factories in many production indicators? For vehicle repair factories, the number of vehicles repaired is planned, unlike other factories that can greatly increase production, so the increase in output value and output indicators is limited. Assessing the work of vehicle repair factories usually looks at the cost and the length of the production cycle. Only by making vehicles "as good as new" with very little money and very little time is considered outstanding work. The vehicle repair cost of Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory is the lowest in the country; the number of days vehicles spend in the factory is only second to Qishuyan Locomotive Repair Factory in some cases, and even lower than Qishuyan Locomotive Repair Factory in others, ranking first in the country.

    Compare Indicators with the Advanced, Compare Equipment with the Backward
    Although Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory is a famous advanced factory, what is even more valuable is that the entire factory has no arrogance. On the contrary, the atmosphere of learning with humility is very strong.

    Looking back at the work of Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory over the past few years, one can find a characteristic: they themselves have no original major experiences. The several major measures that played a decisive role in improving and raising the work of the entire factory were all learned from other factories. Before 1954, the work of this factory was also very backward. What made them leap to the first level of advanced level was the implementation of planned management and the organization of balanced production. These were learned from Jiang'an and Changxindian Locomotive Repair Factories. Adjusting construction site organization and improving work processes played a great role in reducing costs and shortening the production cycle. This was an experience learned from Qishuyan Locomotive Repair Factory, and later further improved on this basis. Some factories in Tangshan did a good job of small-scale competitions, with clear goals and strong comparability, and they immediately learned to apply them. Later, whenever a key problem was discovered in each work section, small-scale competitions were launched to solve it. Some factories in Taiyuan used the method of organizing technical performances to mobilize the masses to appraise and summarize advanced experiences. They felt that this method was very good, so they promoted it. Technical performances to improve quality, technical performances to improve efficiency, technical performances to do a good job in production preparation, etc., one after another, allowed everyone to appraise them, and whatever was good was incorporated into the process card.

    Learning from the advanced was the case in the past, and it is the case today. Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory does not stop moving forward just because it is already advanced. They are also doing everything possible to organize a great leap forward in production. There is always a higher heaven, and the advanced can be even more advanced; moreover, some indicators of Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory are not the most advanced. Now, the factory has formulated a leap forward plan for 1958. In terms of shortening the number of days vehicles spend in the factory, in addition to open cars and flat cars medium repair already ranking first in the country, it is planned to further shorten them by 15% to 20% in 1958. Major repairs of various freight cars and medium repairs of covered wagons should catch up with Qishuyan Locomotive Repair Factory and exceed the current level of Qishuyan Factory. In terms of reducing costs, as mentioned earlier, the cost of Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory is the lowest in the country, but they have further made a detailed analysis and found that the timber yield and the utilization rate of old materials in Taiyuan Locomotive Repair Factory are higher than those of this factory. The high or low rate of new material acquisition and the utilization rate of old materials for steel and wood boards have a decisive impact on the high or low cost of vehicle repair. They proposed to learn from Taiyuan Factory's experience in this regard and catch up with and surpass Taiyuan Factory. In total, they found eleven indicators that were not as good as those of fraternal factories. These indicators were distributed in seven factories, many of which were only small indicators that had little impact and were not assessed by the state, such as the finished product rate of springs, etc., but they all proposed to learn from these factories and formulate plans to catch up with and surpass these advanced indicators.

    Eyes are on the top, and every indicator is compared with the advanced; only one thing is compared with the bottom, and that is equipment.

    Many cadres and workers in the factory have complaints about the simplicity of the factory buildings and the backwardness of the equipment; especially after visiting those newly built and well-equipped factories, they feel that this factory is "too unsightly." As a result, for a period of time, the factory leaders were very reluctant for employees to visit fraternal factories with advanced equipment. They felt that after visiting, there would be a lot of ideological problems, complaining that this was backward and that was not good, and it would be better not to visit. Since the second half of last year, education on building the country diligently and thriftily, and running enterprises diligently and thriftily has been carried out for all cadres and employees. In a few months, several visits were organized. These visits were to small factories and handicraft production cooperatives in Shijiazhuang City. After returning, the discussion changed greatly. The equipment of these small factories and cooperatives is even more backward, truly a "worn-out oxcart with a bumpy harness," but the workers are very motivated, the spirit of diligence and thrift is touching, and even the scattered iron filings in the garbage dumps are turned out with a magnet to be utilized. The quality of some products is even better than that of large factories, which gave the cadres a great education. Since then, the factory has clarified another principle: compare equipment with the bottom, and learn the spirit of diligence and thrift in running enterprises and cooperatives from small factories and cooperatives. Only by implementing this spirit can we accumulate more funds, build some advanced and backbone large industries, and promote the development of socialist construction.

    Combining Leadership with the Masses
    Although many major measures to improve production in Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory were learned from other factories, from the perspective of leadership methods, they have a very important experience that is worth learning from other factories. This is the combination of improving leadership's management work and mass activities.

    The mass activities of this factory are almost constant. Not to mention political struggles, production work also adopts the method of conducting competitions. Starting from the "Competition for Preparing for War and Repairing Losses" in the early days of liberation (note: at that time, the Kuomintang army attempted to attack Shijiazhuang by surprise, and some of the factory's machines were evacuated, and production was somewhat damaged, so while preparing for war, they were also "repairing losses"), various competitions and movements have been held every year, with catchy slogans and lively forms. Last year, an advanced producer movement centered on saving steel and wood was carried out for a year. In the process, it was found that some quality problems had not been solved, so a period of "show your skills and do a good job in one outstanding thing" activity was concentrated on, solving the four major key problems in quality, and no car was returned for rework throughout the year. There are also different activities for different objects, such as the "Thousand Nails Not Loose" competition among riveters, the "Youth Shock Team Movement," the "Save Ten Thousand Taels of Gold Movement," and the "Youth Savings Team Movement" among young people. The factory leaders believe that carrying out mass competitions is the best way to implement the mass line. It mobilizes a wide range, boosts great energy, and has significant effects.

    Once the masses are mobilized, the leadership work must quickly follow up, constantly improve the enterprise's management work, and promote the development of production. Otherwise, it will inevitably hinder the发挥 of the masses' enthusiasm and become a stumbling block to production. In this regard, Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory is a bold reformer. Many problems that others find very棘手 have been solved by them after research. There are many examples in this regard, in planning management, technical management, and labor organization.

    Break with Conventions
    In improving enterprise management work, there must be a spirit of breaking with conventions.

    Over the years, Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory has formulated many systems. According to statistics during the rectification, there are still one hundred and fifty-eight effective management systems alone. These systems have played a great role in improving the enterprise's management work, but now it seems that some of them are outdated, and some of them may not have been completely appropriate even in the beginning. In this rectification, Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory used the spirit of breaking with the old to carry out a major cleanup of the existing management systems, abolishing one hundred and twelve items, modifying twenty-one items, and newly formulating ten items. The innovation of these management systems and some other unwritten rules has played a great role in发挥 the enthusiasm of the masses and correctly organizing production. For example, for a long time, the factory has uniformly used the four major indicators of "total output value, commodity output value, labor productivity, and cost reduction" as the criteria for assessing various workshops. In fact, the tasks of various workshops are different, and the assessment indicators are the same, which is not conducive to grasping the most central problem. The central task of the lumbering workshop is to improve the new material yield and the utilization rate of old materials. As long as the car repair progress is guaranteed, what if the amount of sawn timber is less and the output value is lower? Why must we blindly saw timber to complete the output value indicators? Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory has boldly reformed these conventions that are not conducive to production.

    However, things within the scope of the factory's authority are easy to handle, and many systems and rules are formulated by higher authorities and cannot be changed without authorization. In this regard, Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory also adopted a correct attitude: submitting reports and making suggestions. The "Freight Car Major and Medium Repair Regulations" of the Ministry of Railways are very detailed, stipulating to what extent those parts are worn and must be scrapped and replaced with new ones. These regulations are certainly very good, but some of them are not in line with the spirit of thrift. As long as a slight crack is found in the axle wheel seat, it is forbidden to use it, and all handbrake wheels with an outer diameter of less than four hundred and five millimeters are scrapped. These regulations have caused a large amount of waste of steel and other materials, and have also hurt the workers' enthusiasm for thrift. Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory actively organized technical research, came up with specific methods to use these "waste materials" without affecting the quality of car repair, and submitted them to the Ministry of Railways for approval to revise these conventions. Last year alone, more than 100 suggestions for revising the limits of regulations were put forward, of which twenty-seven items could save more than 20,000 tons of steel throughout the year.

    "Break with Conventions" is not a new slogan. In the high tide of 1956, it was also popular for a while. But later, I don't know where a gust of wind came from, and it seemed that conventions should not be broken. In fact, everything is developing, and any rules and regulations, even if they were completely correct at the time, are only products of a certain historical period and need to be continuously modified with the development of the situation; moreover, some rules and regulations may not have been completely correct even at the time. Now we are in the midst of a great leap forward, and the breaking of conventions is inevitable. The leaders of enterprises and the management departments of enterprises should be prepared in this regard. This is a little feeling after the reporter visited Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory.

    天外还有天
    本报记者　范荣康
    带着十九世纪色彩的先进厂
    石家庄货车修理工厂，是全国铁路车辆修理工厂中的先进厂之一，也是石家庄市和河北省最著名的模范工厂之一。他们的许多生产指标，在全国同类工厂中是名列前矛的。
    来到石家庄以前，也曾听说石家庄货车修理工厂是一个厂房简陋、设备落后的老厂；但若不是身历其境，很难设想这个工厂的厂房简陋到什么程度、设备落后到什么程度。这里，从解体到组装的全部货车修理过程，有80％到85％的工作量是露天进行的。前几年为了改善劳动条件，才搭了一些防护席棚。夏季固然可以挡挡太阳，但一到秋末冬初，为了防止积雪把席棚压塌，只得把席棚拆除，工人们就在刺骨的冷风中生产。直到记者来厂的前几天，铁道部才拨了十一万块钱，让他们搭了一些盖有铁皮的棚子，免去了雪中操作之苦。但这种铁皮棚子，四壁除了几根支撑棚顶的铁架之外，并无一砖一木，也不比露天作业好多少。而且即便经过这次改善，也还留下了一些席棚工房。此外，还有用报废的车辆木壳做工房的。
    至于机器设备，那就更差了。走进机工车间，只见一条条皮带悬在天轴上。原来这里还有许多老式的皮带车床。据范玉岐副厂长回忆：解放以后只添了一部进口新机器，其他由于生产发展所增添的设备，大都是从兄弟工厂的旧机器中调拨的。
    这个带着十九世纪色彩的老工厂，确实是处处叫人“看不上”的。有人曾经考虑过把这个工厂报废，另觅新址建厂。但中共石家庄市委和厂里的干部觉得报废了可惜，提出异议，才让它继续生存下来。谁知道竟是这个又破又老的工厂在许多生产指标方面，走到兄弟厂的前面去。对于车辆修理工厂来说，由于修多少车是有一定计划的，不像别的工厂那样可以大量增产，因而产值指标和产量指标的增长，都有一定的限度。考核车辆修理工厂的工作，通常看成本如何、生产周期长短。只有用很少的钱和很少的时间使车辆“整旧如新”，才算是工作出色的。石家庄货车修理工厂的修车成本，在全国最低；车辆在厂日数，有的仅次于戚墅堰机车修理工厂，有的比戚墅堰机车修理工厂还要低，在全国占第一位。
    指标同上比，设备同下比
    石家庄货车修理工厂虽然是著名的先进工厂，但更可贵的是，全厂没有骄气。相反地，虚心学习的气氛非常浓厚。
    回顾石家庄货车修理工厂几年来的工作，可以发现一个特点，他们自己并没有什么独创的重大经验，对于改善和提高全厂工作起了决定作用的几项重大措施，都是从其他工厂学来的。1954年以前，这个工厂的工作也很落后，使他们跃上先进水平第一个阶台的，是实行计划管理，组织均衡生产。这些，是从江岸和长辛店机车修理工厂学来的。调整工地组织，改善作业过程，对降低成本、缩短生产周期起了很大的作用。这是从戚墅堰机车修理工厂学来的经验，后来在这个基础上进一步提高了的。唐山的一些工厂小型竞赛搞得好，目标明确，可比性强，他们马上学来运用上了。以后每个工段发现了关键问题，都发动小型竞赛来解决。太原的一些工厂用组织技术表演的办法，发动群众鉴定和总结先进经验。他们觉得这个办法很好，就推广起来。提高质量的技术表演，提高效率的技术表演，做好生产准备工作的技术表演等等，一个接着一个，让大家来鉴定，那一点好就把那一点订入工艺卡片。
    向先进学习，过去是如此，今天也是如此。石家庄货车修理工厂并不因为自己已经先进了而停步不前，他们同样在千方百计地组织生产大跃进。天外还有天，先进的还可以更先进；况且石家庄货车修理工厂有些指标还不是最先进的。现在，厂里已经订出了1958年的跃进计划。在缩短车辆在厂日数上，除了敞车和平车中修已占全国首位，计划在1958年再缩短15％到20％外，各种货车的大修和棚车的中修，都要赶上戚墅堰机车修理工厂，超过戚墅堰厂现在的水平。降低成本，前面说过，石家庄货车修理工厂的成本是全国最低的，但他们又进一步做了具体分析，发现太原机车修理工厂的锯材出材率和旧材利用率都比本厂高。钢材和木板的新材取材率和旧材利用率的高低，对修车成本的高低有决定性影响。他们就提出在这方面学习太原厂的经验，赶上和超过太原厂。总计他们共找出十一项不如兄弟厂的指标，这些指标分在七个工厂里，其中很多只是影响不大的、国家并不考核的小指标，如弹簧的成品率等等，但他们都提出要向这些工厂学习，订出赶上和超过这些先进指标的计划。
    眼睛朝上，个个指标都同先进的比；唯有一样是同下比的，这就是设备。
    厂里的许多干部和工人，对本厂厂房的简陋、设备的落后是有牢骚的；特别是到那些新建的、设备好的厂参观回来之后，更觉得本厂“太不像样”。以致有一个时期，厂里的领导干部很不愿意职工去设备先进的兄弟厂参观，他们觉得参观回来就是一大堆思想问题，嫌这也落后，说那也不行，倒不如不去参观还好。去年下半年以来，对全体干部和职工进行了勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的教育，在几个月的时间里，组织了几次参观。这几次参观的是石家庄市的小工厂和手工业生产合作社。回来后，议论大变。这些小厂小社设备还要落后，真是“老牛破车疙瘩套”，但工人们的干劲很大，勤俭的精神感人，垃圾堆里星星点点的铁屑也要用吸铁石把它翻出来利用，有些产品的质量比大厂的还好，给了干部很大的教育。从此，厂里又明确了一条原则：设备同下比，学习小厂小社勤俭办企业、勤俭办社的精神，只有贯彻这样的精神，才能积累更多的资金，建设一些先进的、起骨干作用的大工业，促进社会主义建设事业的发展。
    领导和群众相结合
    石家庄货车修理工厂改进生产的许多重大措施，虽然是从别的工厂学来的，但从领导方法来看，他们却有一条很重要的经验，值得别的工厂学习。这就是改进领导的管理工作和群众活动相结合。
    这个工厂的群众活动几乎是不断的。政治斗争不说，生产工作也是采取搞竞赛的方法。从解放初期的“备战补损竞赛”开始（按：当时国民党军队企图偷袭石家庄，工厂的机器撤退了一部分，生产受到一些损失，故一面备战，一面“补损”），各种各样的竞赛和运动年年都有，口号响亮，形式活泼。去年搞了一年以节约钢材、木料为中心的先进生产者运动，当中发现有些质量问题没有解决，集中开展了一段“拿出一手本领，办好一件突出事”的活动，解决了质量上的四大关键问题，全年没有一辆返厂重修的车。不同的对象还有不同的活动，如铆工中的“千钉不松”竞赛，青年中的“青年突击手运动”、“节约万两黄金运动”、“青年节约队运动”等等。厂里的领导同志认为，开展群众性的竞赛活动乃是贯彻群众路线的最好的形式。它动员的面广、鼓起的劲大、效果显著。
    群众一经发动起来，领导工作必须迅速跟上去，不断地改善企业的管理工作，促进生产的发展。否则，就必然阻碍群众积极性的发挥，成为生产的绊脚石。在这方面，石家庄货车修理工厂是大胆的改革派。许多别人觉得很棘手的问题，他们经过研究，都解决了。这方面的例子很多，在计划管理、技术管理、劳动组织等方面都有。
    打破陈规
    在改善企业管理工作上，必须有打破陈规的精神。
    这些年来，石家庄货车修理工厂订了许多制度，据整改时统计，仅管理制度，仍生效的就有一百五十八项。这些制度对于健全企业的管理工作起了很大的作用，但现在看来，其中有些已经过时了，有些即便在当初也未必是完全妥当的。这次整改中，石家庄货车修理工厂用打破陈旧的精神，对现行的管理制度来了一次大清理，废除了一百一十二项，修改了二十一项，新订了十项。这些管理制度和其他一些不成文的规矩的革新，对发挥群众的积极性，正确地组织生产，起了很大的作用。例如长期以来，工厂对各个车间一律以“总产值、商品产值、劳动生产率和降低成本”四大指标，作为考绩的标准。其实各个车间的任务不同，考绩的指标千篇一律，反而不利于抓住最中心的问题。制材车间的中心任务是提高新材出材率和旧材利用率，只要保证修车进度，锯材的数量少些、产值低些又有何妨？何必硬要完成产值指标而盲目地锯材呢？类似这些不利于生产的陈规，石家庄货车修理厂都大胆地作了改革。
    但是，属于本厂职权范围内的事情好办，许多制度规矩都是上级制定的，不能擅自更改。在这方面，石家庄货车修理工厂也采取了正确的态度：打报告、提意见。铁道部的“货车大中修规程”订得很细致，那些部件磨损到什么程度就必须报废另换新的。这些规定当然很好，但有些是不符合节约的精神的。车轴轮座只要发现轻微的裂缝就禁止使用，手闸轮凡外径小于四百零五公厘的一律报废。这些规定造成了大批钢铁器材的浪费，也伤害了工人节约的积极性。石家庄货车修理工厂积极组织技术研究，拿出使用这些“废料”决不影响修车质量的具体方法，呈请铁道部批准修改这些陈规。仅去年就提出一百多项修改规章限度的建议，其中的二十七项全年就可以节约钢材两万多吨。
    “打破陈规”，这不是什么新的口号，1956年的高潮中，它也曾盛行一时。但是后来不知从哪里刮来一阵风，似乎陈规也不该打破。其实，一切事物都是发展的，任何规章制度，即便当时完全正确，也只是一定历史时期的产物，需要随着形势的发展不断地加以修改；况且有些规章制度，即便在当时也未必是完全正确的。现在正处在大跃进中，陈规之被打破，是必然的。企业的领导干部和企业的管理部门应该在这方面有所准备。这是记者访问石家庄货车修理工厂后的一点感想。
