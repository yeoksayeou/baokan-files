In this world, the desire for peace has never been as widespread and strong as it is now. People of all countries long for major powers to take action to end the "Cold War" and the arms race, in order to relieve their worries about the threat of nuclear war.

The Soviet Union and the United States, due to their material strength and influence on international affairs, bear a particularly important responsibility in realizing the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries. However, these two countries have adopted completely different attitudes towards the issue of peace.

The Soviet Union has consistently and consistently worked hard to strive for peace. Especially as the new world has clearly surpassed the old world in terms of the balance of power, the Soviet Union has intensified its actions to strive for peace. Chairman Bulganin recently wrote letters to the leaders of many countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, suggesting that summit talks be held to discuss the resolution of disarmament and other major international disputes, in order to promote the peaceful coexistence of the two systems. In order to effectively resolve international disputes, the Soviet Union proposed a gradual and phased approach, first reaching agreements on urgent and easily resolved issues, and then proceeding to resolve more difficult and fundamental issues. At the same time, the Soviet Union once again took practical action in disarmament, announcing a reduction of 300,000 troops. The Soviet Union's peace proposals and its practical actions have won widespread trust and support from public opinion in various countries. The call for a summit meeting between the East and West has become the overwhelming voice in current international affairs.

Under such circumstances, the leaders of the U.S. government have also had to talk about their desire for peace. However, as in the past, while they are talking about peace, they are actually engaged in actions to step up arms expansion and war preparation and intensify the "Cold War." This policy of false peace and true war preparation is clearly demonstrated in U.S. President Eisenhower's "State of the Union Address" and "Budget Message."

The U.S. President's two messages sang the same tune, which is to greatly increase military spending to step up the production of missiles and nuclear weapons. In the "State of the Union Address," the U.S. President listed eight items that need to be taken, six of which are for arms expansion and war preparation, and five of these six are for stepping up the production of missiles and nuclear weapons. In the "Budget Message," the U.S. President requested an additional $1.3 billion in military appropriations for the current fiscal year, and the new fiscal year's military appropriations will increase by $3.8 billion compared to the original appropriations for the current fiscal year. These additional and new military appropriations are mainly used for the production of missiles and nuclear weapons. In this way, although the estimated national expenditure for the new fiscal year has increased significantly compared to the current fiscal year (from $71.8 billion to $73.9 billion), non-military appropriations have decreased by $4.4 billion compared to the current fiscal year. Military expenditures account for more than 81% of the total national budget expenditure. This is entirely a budget that disregards the national economy and the people's livelihood, and tries its best to accumulate weapons of mass destruction.

The state of a country's budget expenditures is an important sign of its domestic and foreign policy trends. Since Eisenhower has put the United States on the road of stepping up the missile and nuclear weapons race, then his words in the "State of the Union Address" such as "the world must stop engaging in the manufacture of more and more destructive weapons of war" and "in all peace efforts, what is most needed now is to take a real first step towards disarmament" are not only worthless, but also completely hypocritical. The U.S. government has not deviated from the bankrupt road of the "policy of strength," but on the contrary, it is accelerating to continue to promote this policy.

It is precisely from this policy that Eisenhower, in his reply to Bulganin's letter, not only denied all of the Soviet Union's peace proposals, but also put forward counter-proposals such as requiring the Soviet Union to abandon its veto power in the United Nations, interfering in the internal affairs of Eastern European socialist countries, and allowing West Germany to annex East Germany. These so-called counter-proposals are essentially aimed at forcing the Soviet Union and all socialist countries to submit to the U.S. "policy of strength." The U.S. put forward these counter-proposals, knowing full well that the Soviet Union could not accept them, for no other purpose than to obstruct East-West talks and shift the responsibility for the failure of negotiations to the Soviet Union.

In his two messages and his reply to Bulganin's letter, the U.S. President made it seem as if the U.S. actions to step up arms expansion and war preparation and continue to pursue the "policy of strength" were due to the so-called "threat" to the U.S.'s "security" from the Soviet Union. The U.S. ruling group has been clamoring about this ever since the Soviet Union possessed intercontinental ballistic missiles and launched two satellites into space. However, everyone knows that the Soviet Union's national leaders have repeatedly stated that although the Soviet Union possesses the most modern weapons that the U.S. does not have, once a reliable agreement is reached, the Soviet Union can throw these weapons, along with other destructive weapons of war, into the sea together with the U.S. Chairman Bulganin's repeated calls for a meeting of leaders of Eastern and Western countries and his many peace proposals are aimed at promoting the realization of the above-mentioned goals. The Soviet Union has constantly put forward these peace proposals in the past, and today, when the Soviet Union has gained an advantage in major scientific and military technologies, it still advocates resolving international disputes through negotiations. This powerfully proves that the U.S.'s clamor about the so-called "Soviet threat" is completely fabricated. If the U.S. President and other figures of the U.S. ruling group are truly concerned about the security of the U.S. as they say, then they should accept the Soviet Union's peace proposals, rather than take provocative actions to step up the arms race. Under the current military and technological conditions, if, as the U.S. advertises, only a balance of power can allow for negotiations to take place, then a mutual competition between major powers will inevitably form, and it will never be possible to conduct any negotiations. And the result of stepping up the arms race will not only aggravate international tensions, but will also bring serious threats to the security of the countries that take such actions.

Throughout the entire period since the end of the war, the U.S. ruling group has always relied on its so-called "position of strength" to issue orders to the world and promote its policy of aggression and expansion. This so-called "position of strength" includes the U.S.'s so-called "deterrent force," the military groups that the U.S. has established around the world, and the network of military bases spread around the world. These are the most important tools used by the U.S. to intimidate socialist countries, suppress colonial national independence movements, and control other capitalist countries. This "deterrent force" has never intimidated peace-loving countries and people, and after the Soviet Union possessed intercontinental ballistic missiles, its role has become even more questionable. At the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Group last December, the government leaders of some European countries refused to accept the U.S. plan to establish medium-range missile bases on their territories, and advocated holding negotiations with the Soviet Union; the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo recently unanimously condemned the U.S.'s policy of aggression against Asia and Africa, and negated the Eisenhower Doctrine; all of these profoundly reflect the crisis of the U.S.'s policy of aggression and war.

At the same time, obvious signs of economic recession have also appeared in the U.S. According to figures released by the U.S. Federal Reserve System Administration, the U.S. industrial production index in December of last year had already fallen to 136, a decrease of 7.5% in one year. And the decline in January of this year has become even more serious. While production is shrinking, according to U.S. official statistics, the number of unemployed people in December of last year had also increased to 3,374,000, the highest figure since February 1950. This recession in the U.S. economy is occurring at a time when its several major pillars, such as business capital expenditures, housing construction, and automobile sales, are all showing signs of weakness or decline, and at the same time, the economy of the entire capitalist world is also very unstable, all of which portend a bleak prospect.

The U.S. monopoly groups, especially those monopoly groups that have obtained huge profits from the "Cold War" and the policy of arms expansion and war preparation, feel extremely uneasy about the failure of the U.S.'s "policy of strength" and the domestic economic recession. The Gaither Committee, mainly composed of agents of the Rockefeller Group and the Mellon family, and the Rockefeller Committee, chaired by Rockefeller himself, have separately submitted reports to the U.S. government, clamoring that the U.S. is "in the most serious danger in its history," and demanding that it step up arms expansion and war preparation in order to catch up with the Soviet Union in missile development. They believe that "huge military expenditures" are "indispensable." The Rockefeller report even demands that military expenditures be increased progressively at a rate of $3 billion per year for the next four years. Obviously, they are attempting to continue to maintain international tensions as a pretext for arms expansion and war preparation, thereby coercing the American people to tighten their belts and take out money; they are attempting to use arms expansion and war preparation to save the "policy of strength" that has already fallen into complete bankruptcy, and to prevent the economic recession from further heading towards an economic crisis.

The policies proposed by the U.S. President in his two messages are completely in line with the wishes of the above-mentioned U.S. monopoly groups. This policy is not only completely contrary to the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries, but also extremely harmful to the vital interests of the American people. It only guarantees the profits of a small group of monopoly groups like Rockefeller. The best proof is that after the U.S. President's "Budget Message" was put forward, the stock prices of steel, aircraft, missile, airline, shipping, and chemical enterprises that are closely related to the expansion of armaments immediately rose on the New York stock market.

The arms expansion and war preparation policy of the U.S. ruling group will not help to improve their world position. Similarly, this policy will not allow U.S. monopoly capital to escape the inevitable economic crisis. Because, huge military expenditures will inevitably increase the burden of taxation, promote the development of inflation, and increase the national debt. U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson has already had to increase the national debt limit from $275 billion to $280 billion after the U.S. President put forward the new budget. This shows that the method of arms expansion and war preparation will not only fail to solve the crisis of the U.S.'s excess productivity, but will also aggravate the crisis of inflation.

Recent developments are not as the U.S. ruling group had hoped. The U.S. ruling group is under increasingly strong pressure. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the U.S. ruling group to continue to rudely refuse to hold high-level negotiations, refuse to ease international tensions, and avoid falling into a more isolated position. It is precisely under such a situation that Eisenhower and Dulles have had to change their tone somewhat, and while stepping up arms expansion and war preparation, they cannot but express their willingness to conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union. However, acknowledging reality, accepting negotiations, abandoning the "Cold War" and arms expansion and war preparation, and accepting peaceful coexistence are ultimately contrary to the basic policies of the U.S. ruling group. Therefore, in order to realize peace, the most urgent task facing the peaceful forces of the whole world is to strengthen unity and continue to struggle.

    美国的动向
    在这个世界上，要求和平的愿望，从来没有像现在这样广泛和强大。各国人民渴望着大国采取行动，来结束“冷战”和军备竞赛，以解除他们对于核战争威胁的忧虑。
    苏联和美国，由于它们所拥有的物质力量和对国际事务的影响，在实现各国人民的和平愿望方面，担当着特别重要的责任。但是，这两个国家在对待和平的问题上，采取了截然不同的态度。
    苏联一贯言行一致地积极为争取和平而努力。特别是新世界在力量对比上已明显超过旧世界的情况下，苏联更加紧了它争取和平的行动。布尔加宁主席最近两次写信给包括美、英、法在内的许多国家的领导人，建议举行最高级会谈，协商解决裁军和其他重大的国际争端，以促进两个制度的和平共处。为了有效地解决国际争端，苏联建议中提出了逐步的分阶段的方法，先就迫切的和容易解决的问题，达成协议，再进而解决比较困难和根本性的问题。同时，苏联还再一次在裁军方面采取了实际行动，宣布裁减武装部队三十万人。苏联的和平建议和它的实际行动，赢得了各国舆论的广泛信任和支持。要求东西方举行最高级会谈的呼声，已成为当前国际事务中压倒一切的声音了。
    在这种情况下，美国政府领导人也不得不谈论和平的愿望。但是，同以往的情形一样，他们在高谈和平的时候，实际上干的却是加紧扩军备战和加剧“冷战”的行动。这种假和平、真备战的政策，在美国总统艾森豪威尔的“国情咨文”和“预算咨文”中表现得十分清楚。
    美国总统的两个咨文所唱的是一个调子，那就是：大大地增加军事费用，来加紧制造导弹和核武器。在“国情咨文”中，美国总统列举八项需要采取行动的项目，其中有六项是为了扩军备战，而这六项中有五项又是为了加紧制造导弹和核武器。在“预算咨文”中，美国总统要求把本财政年度的军事拨款再追加十三亿美元，而新的财政年度的军事拨款还要比本财政年度原订拨款增加三十八亿美元。这些追加的和新的军事拨款，主要是用于制造导弹和核武器的。这样，新的财政年度国家开支概算虽然比本财政年度增加了不少（从七百一十八亿美元增加到七百三十九亿美元），而非军事拨款却比本财政年度减少了四十四亿美元。军事性质的开支在国家总预算支出中占了81％以上。这完全是一个不顾国计民生，而竭力要大规模累积毁灭性武器的预算。
    一个国家预算开支的情况，是它的对内对外政策动向的重要标志。艾森豪威尔既然把美国推上了加紧导弹和核武器竞赛的道路，那么，他在“国情咨文”中所说的“世界必须停止目前从事制造越来越多的毁灭性战争武器”，以及“在一切和平工作中，现在最需要的是朝裁军方面走真正的第一步”这一类表示和平愿望的话，就不只是毫无价值的，而且是完全虚伪的了。美国政府并没有离开那个早已破了产的“实力政策”的道路，相反的是加速地来继续推行这种政策。
    正是从这种政策出发，艾森豪威尔在他答复布尔加宁的信中，不但对苏联的和平建议一概加以否定，而且还提出了要求苏联放弃它在联合国中的否决权、干涉东欧社会主义国家内政、让西德吞并东德等一些反建议。这些所谓反建议，实质上是要苏联和所有的社会主义国家在美国的“实力政策”下屈服。美国提出这些明知苏联不能接受的反建议来，无非是为了阻挠东西方会谈，并把谈判不成的责任推到苏联的头上去。
    美国总统在他的两个咨文和答复布尔加宁的信中，把事情说成好像美国加紧扩军备战和继续推行“实力政策”的行动，是由于美国的“安全”受到了所谓苏联的“威胁”。美国统治集团在苏联拥有洲际弹道火箭和两个卫星上天之后，一直在这样叫嚷。可是，谁都知道，苏联的国家领导人曾一再表明，虽然苏联拥有美国所没有的最新式的武器，只要一旦达成可靠的协议，苏联可以同美国一起把这些武器连同其他毁灭性的战争武器一道抛到大海中去。布尔加宁主席一再呼吁召开的东西方国家领导人会议和他提出的许多和平建议，就是为了促成上述目标的实现。苏联过去就不断提出过这些和平建议，今天，当苏联在重大的科学和军事技术上占了优势的时候，仍是主张通过谈判解决国际争端。这有力地证明了，美国叫嚷的什么“苏联威胁”，完全是捏造出来的。美国总统和美国统治集团的其他人物，如果真像他们所说的那样关心美国的安全，那么，他们就应该接受苏联的和平建议，而不是采取加紧军备竞赛的挑衅行动。在目前的军事技术条件下，如果照美国所宣传的那样，唯有势力均衡才能进行谈判，那么，势必形成大国之间的相互竞争，永远也不可能进行任何谈判。而加紧军备竞赛的结果，不但会加剧国际紧张局势，并且也会为采取这种行动的国家的安全带来严重的威胁。
    在战后以来的整个期间内，美国统治集团一向依靠着他们所拥有的所谓“实力地位”，来向世界发号施令，推行他们的侵略扩张政策。这种所谓“实力地位”，包括了美国的所谓“威慑力量”、美国在世界各处所建立的军事集团和遍布世界的军事基地网。这是美国用以威吓社会主义国家、镇压殖民地民族独立运动和控制其他资本主义国家的最主要的工具。这种“威慑力量”从来就没有吓倒过爱好和平的国家和人民，而在苏联拥有洲际弹道火箭之后，它的作用已更成问题了。去年12月在北大西洋集团的巴黎会议上，一些欧洲国家的政府领导人不肯接受美国在他们国家的领土上建立中程导弹基地的计划，主张同苏联举行谈判；最近在开罗举行的亚非人民团结大会一致斥责美国对亚非的侵略政策，否定了艾森豪威尔主义；这都深刻地反映了美国的侵略战争政策的危机。
    与此同时，在美国国内也出现了明显的经济衰退的现象。据美国联邦储备系统管理局公布的数字，去年12月美国工业生产指数已经下降到一百三十六，一年之间工业生产下降了7.5％。而今年1月间下降的情况更趋严重。在生产缩减的同时，据美国官方统计，失业人数在去年12月也已增加到三百三十七万四千人，是1950年2月以来的最高数字。美国经济的这一次衰退，是发生在它的几个主要支柱，如企业资本支出、房屋建筑、汽车销售等都呈现出疲软或下降的情况下，同时整个资本主义世界的经济也是十分的不稳定，这都预示着一个黯淡的前景。
    美国的垄断集团，特别是那些从“冷战”和扩军备战政策中获得大量利润的垄断集团，对于美国“实力政策”的失败和国内经济的衰退，感到极大的不安。主要由洛克菲勒集团和梅隆家族代理人组成的盖瑟委员会和由洛克菲勒自己主持的洛克菲勒委员会，曾分别向美国政府提出报告，大嚷大叫地说美国已经“处于它历史上最严重的危险中”，并且要求加紧扩军备战，求得在导弹发展方面赶上苏联。他们认为“巨大的军费支出”是“必不可少的”。洛克菲勒的报告甚至要求在今后四年内以每年三十亿美元的速度累进地增加军事费用。显然，他们是企图继续保持国际紧张局势，作为扩军备战的张本，借以要挟美国人民勒紧裤腰带，拿出钱来；企图以扩军备战的办法，来挽救那个已经陷于彻底破产的“实力政策”，并借以阻止经济衰退进一步走向经济危机。
    美国总统在两个咨文中提出的政策，是完全符合于美国上述的垄断集团的愿望的。这种政策不但与各国人民的和平愿望完全相违背，而且对于美国人民的切身利益也是极端有害的。它只是保障了洛克菲勒之流的一小撮垄断集团的利润。在美国总统的“预算咨文”提出后，纽约股票市场上的同扩张军备有密切关系的钢铁、飞机、导弹、航空公司、航运和化学企业的股票价格，立刻上涨，就是最好的证明。
    美国统治集团的扩军备战政策绝不会有助于改善他们的世界地位。同样的，这种政策也不会使美国垄断资本逃脱不可避免的经济危机。因为，巨大的军费支出必然要加重赋税负担，促进通货膨胀的发展，并使国债增加。美国财政部长安德逊在美国总统提出新的预算之后，已要把国债限额从二千七百五十亿美元，增加到二千八百亿美元。这说明，扩军备战的方法不但不能解决美国生产力过剩的危机，还会加重通货膨胀的危机。
    最近事情的发展，并不像美国统治集团所指望的那样。美国统治集团正受到越来越强大的压力。美国统治集团要继续粗暴地拒绝举行高级谈判、拒绝缓和国际紧张局势而不陷于更加孤立的地位，已经是越来越困难了。正是在这样的形势下，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯不得不多少改变一些腔调，在加紧扩军备战的同时，不能不表示愿意同苏联进行谈判。但是，承认现实，接受谈判，放弃“冷战”和扩军备战，接受和平共处，终究是同美国统治集团的基本政策相违背的。因此，为了实现和平，摆在全世界和平力量面前的最迫切的任务，就是要加强团结，再接再厉地进行斗争。
