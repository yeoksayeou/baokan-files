At this district people's representative conference, specifically convened to prepare for the establishment of the autonomous prefecture, 292 representatives from various ethnic groups listened to and discussed the report on the progress of preparing for the establishment of the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, delivered by Geng Zhengguo, Commissioner of Chuxiong, and the report on "Preliminary Opinions on the Merger of Branches of Ethnic Minorities in Chuxiong District" delivered by Lu Jiefu, Deputy Commissioner, and unanimously agreed. After Wang Wenyu, Secretary of the CPC Chuxiong Prefectural Committee, reported on the progress of the winter production campaign in the district, all representatives unanimously expressed their determination to continue mobilizing people of all ethnic groups in the district to ensure the completion of the planned water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation tasks before the end of March to welcome the establishment of the autonomous prefecture.

Chuxiong District is located in central Yunnan, bordering Sichuan along the Jinsha River to the north. It includes sixteen counties with a total population of 1,673,000 people. There are ten ethnic groups in the area, with the Yi population accounting for more than 23% of the total population of the district. Since April of last year, the local CPC Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office, under the leadership of the higher party and government authorities, began to study the issue of ethnic regional autonomy. They successively organized ethnic work teams to conduct investigations and studies on the ethnic minorities and various branches of the Yi ethnic group within the district, and fully consulted with representatives of local ethnic groups. Last autumn, they reported to the State Council for approval to establish the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province.

    楚雄彝族自治州筹委会成立

    在这次为筹备成立自治州而专门召开的全区人民代表会议上，各个民族的二百九十二个代表听取和讨论了楚雄专员耿正国所作的筹建云南省楚雄彝族自治州经过的报告和副专员陆介福所作的“关于楚雄区少数民族支系归并的初步意见”的报告，并一致同意。在中共楚雄地委书记王文玉报告了全区冬季生产运动的进展情况以后，全体代表一致表示要继续动员全区各族人民保证在3月底前完成预计的水利和积肥任务，迎接自治州的成立。
    会议还讨论了中共云南省委关于在少数民族地区进行整风和社会主义教育的指示，表示坚决拥护。
    楚雄区在云南中部，北沿金沙江与四川接壤，包括十六个县，人口共一百六十七万三千多人，境内有十个民族，彝族人口占全区总人口的23％以上。从去年4月起，当地中共地委和专署就在上级党和政府领导下着手研究民族区域自治问题，相继组织了民族工作组，对境内少数民族和彝族各支系作了调查研究，和当地各民族代表人物作了充分协商酝酿，并在去年秋报经国务院批准建立云南省楚雄彝族自治州。
