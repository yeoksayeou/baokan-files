Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 19th – In formulating this year's production plan, the Nanjing Radio Factory abandoned the stance of a state-owned factory, changed its original plan based on the needs of the people and support for rural areas, and transformed the entire factory from a planned reduction in production to an increase in production.

The factory's original main products, such as telephones and switchboards, were not required to be significantly increased by the state. Therefore, the initial 1958 production plan called for a 6.74% decrease compared to 1957. However, after discovering a way to expand product variety and increase production based on the needs of the people and support for rural areas, the revised 1958 production plan called for a 25.7% increase compared to 1957, and a 62.2% increase compared to the plan assigned by the state. The variety of products also increased from eight to twenty-one. Among the newly added products suitable for rural application are sound-powered telephones, power-free radios, and hand-cranked flashlights.

When the 1958 production plan was being formulated last year, the leading core group, headed by factory director Yang Yilin, believed that although the production of the original main products such as telephones and switchboards could not be increased, the 1958 production plan should definitely not be lower than 1957. They believed that the state-assigned new product trial production tasks must be resolutely completed on schedule, but in this transitional period, they must not wait idly for new tasks. The only way to increase production they proposed was to expand product variety, produce more affordable, high-quality, and durable products based on China's reality, the needs of the people, and support for rural areas. Factory director Yang Yilin specifically requested the trial production of sound-powered telephones and power-free radios suitable for rural applications. However, the factory director's opinion was not agreed upon by the main engineering and technical personnel and department management personnel within the factory. Among the engineering and technical personnel, it was generally believed that producing general products was not the production direction of a state-owned factory. The task of a state-owned factory was to produce products with higher technical requirements. Department personnel were afraid that the increase in products would cause difficulties in production scheduling and affect the completion of the production plan for the main products. After studying the Agricultural Development Program, the factory's employees expressed their willingness to contribute to agricultural construction and firmly demanded the expansion of production to serve rural areas. The Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party supported the employees' demands and cited many examples from 1957 to illustrate that their factory could produce other general products in addition to completing the production tasks of the main products.

After the ideological problems and concerns of the engineering and technical personnel and department management personnel were resolved, some engaged in self-criticism, believing that their ideological understanding lagged behind the objective reality. More departments and technical personnel actively expressed their willingness to dedicate a portion of their time to help solve the technical key points of other products while ensuring the completion of the production tasks of the main products.

### 放下国营厂架子面向农村  南京有线电厂变减产为增产

    放下国营厂架子面向农村
    南京有线电厂变减产为增产
    据新华社南京19日电　南京有线电厂在制订今年的生产计划时，放下国营工厂的架子，从人民需要和支援农村出发改变原来的打算，使全厂由原计划减产变为增产。
    这个工厂原来生产的电话机、交换机等主要产品，由于国家不需要大量增产，因此，他们第一次编制的1958年生产计划，任务比1957年下降了6.74％。由于找到了从人民需要、从支援农村出发，扩大产品品种的增产道路，重新制订的1958年生产计划比1957年增产25.7％，比国家下达的计划增加62.2％；产品品种也由八种增加到二十一种。在新增加的产品中适合农村应用的有声力电话机、无电源收音机和手揿电筒等。
    去年编制1958年生产计划时，以厂长杨逸麟为首的领导骨干认为电话机、交换机等原来生产的主要产品产量虽不能增加，但1958年生产计划决不应比1957年下降。他们认为国家规定的新产品试制任务必须坚决按期完成，但在这过渡时期决不能坐等新的任务。他们提出来的唯一增产道路是必须从我国现实出发，从人民需要、从支援农村出发，扩大产品品种，生产更多价廉物美、经久耐用的产品。厂长杨逸麟并具体提出要求试制适宜农村应用的声力电话机和无电源收音机。但是，厂长的意见，没有得到厂内主要工程技术人员和科室管理人员的赞同。在工程技术人员中，普遍认为生产一般产品，不是国营工厂的生产方向。国营工厂的任务，是要生产技术要求更高的产品。科室人员怕产品增加了，生产调度发生困难，影响完成主要产品的生产计划。全厂职工经过学习农业发展纲要以后，纷纷表示要为农业建设出一把力，坚决要求面向农村扩大生产。中共南京市委支持了职工们的要求，并举出1957年的许多实例，说明他们这个厂在完成主要产品生产任务外，也能生产其他一般产品。
    工程技术人员和科室管理人员存在的思想问题和顾虑得到解决后，有的作了自我批评，认为自己的思想认识落后于客观实际。更多的科室、技术人员积极表示在保证完成主要产品的生产任务的同时，愿意抽出一部分时间帮助解决其他产品的技术关键。
