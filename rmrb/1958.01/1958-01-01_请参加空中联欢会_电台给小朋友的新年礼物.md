    Please Join the Radio Get-Together
    ——A New Year's Gift from the Radio Station to Children
    On the eve of the New Year, the Children's Department of the Central People's Broadcasting Station specially held a New Year's party for young listeners across the country. More than 300 Young Pioneers – little radio enthusiasts – spent an unforgettable evening with writers and actors.

    The actors who came to the party not only brought New Year's greetings to the children, but also performed wonderful programs for them: Du Jinfang of the China Peking Opera Theater sang a fragment from "Mulan Joins the Army," the National Orchestra of the Central People's Broadcasting Station played "Swan Lake" and other programs, Gao Yuanjun of the General Political Department Art Troupe performed the Shandong Fast Talk "Wu Song Fighting the Tiger," Feng Zicun of the Central Song and Dance Troupe played the flute "Happy Reunion," film actors Xie Tian and Chen Fangqian performed a two-man comic act, and Xie Tian also performed ventriloquism and "five different facial makeups." Actors from the Central National Song and Dance Troupe performed song and dance programs. Famous crosstalk comedian Hou Baolin and his apprentice, young crosstalk comedian Ma Ji, performed interesting crosstalk. The singer Ju Xiufang, who was in Shanghai, also received an invitation to the party, but she couldn't come to Beijing to participate. What to do? Thanks to the comrades from the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station for their help in recording her New Year's greetings to the children and her performance for the children, and sending the recording to the party.

    Finally, to thank the writers, actors, uncles, and aunts for their care, the young actors from the Central People's Broadcasting Station Children's Choir and the Children's Radio Drama Troupe also performed crosstalk, singing, and other programs for the uncles and aunts present.

    This party was really good and the content was very rich. Dear children, you may feel regretful that you couldn't attend this party in person, right? It doesn't matter, I'll tell you that on January 1st, the Central People's Broadcasting Station will broadcast the live recording of this party from 8:00 to 9:00 in the morning and from 5:00 to 6:00 in the afternoon, and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station will broadcast it from 4:00 to 5:00 in the afternoon. Please turn on your radios then. ·Fang Lin·

    请参加空中联欢会
    ——电台给小朋友的新年礼物
    新年前夕，中央人民广播电台少年儿童部特地为全国小听众举行了一个新年联欢会。三百多名少先队员——小广播爱好者，和作家、演员共同度过了一个难忘的夜晚。
    前来参加联欢会的演员不光是带来了对小朋友的新年祝贺，还为小朋友表演了精采的节目：中国京剧院杜近芳演唱了“木兰从军”的片断，中央人民广播电台民族管弦乐团演奏了“小天鹅舞曲”等节目，总政文工团高元钧说了山东快书“武松打虎”，中央歌舞团冯子存演奏了笛子“喜相逢”，电影演员谢添和陈方千两人表演了双簧，谢添还表演了口技和“五种不同的脸谱”，中央民族歌舞团的演员表演了歌舞节目，著名相声演员侯宝林和他的徒弟、青年相声演员马季，一同表演了有趣的相声节目，正在上海的歌唱家鞠秀芳也接到了联欢会的邀请，可是她不能来北京参加，怎么办呢？多亏上海人民广播电台的同志帮了她的忙，把她给小朋友祝贺新年的话和为小朋友演唱的节目，录了音寄到联欢会上来了。
    最后，为了感谢作家、演员叔叔、阿姨的关怀，中央人民广播电台少年广播合唱团和儿童广播剧团的小演员们，还为到会的叔叔、阿姨表演了相声、歌唱等节目。
    这个联欢会开得真好，内容真丰富，亲爱的小朋友，可能你会为没有能亲自参加这次晚会而感到遗憾吧？不要紧，我告诉你，到1月1日，中央人民广播电台在上午八点到九点，下午五点到六点，北京人民广播电台下午四点到五点，将播送这个联欢会的实况。到时候请打开你们的收音机吧。　·方林·
