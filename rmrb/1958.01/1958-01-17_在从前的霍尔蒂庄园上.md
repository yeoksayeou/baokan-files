    On the Former Horthy Manor
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang
    The brilliant revolutionary poet Petőfi was born on the plains of the Tisza River basin. The great writer Mór Jókai, who cried out for the suffering of the peasants, also grew up on this fertile but impoverished land. The Tisza River nurtured noble and pure hearts; how proud it is! But unfortunately, a tyrannical demon was also born on its land, who defiled this beautiful river like a poem, and brought endless suffering to the Hungarian people.
    When we arrived in Kiskunfélegyháza, a small town in Szolnok County in eastern Hungary, I learned that the birthplace of the fascist dictator Horthy, who ruled Hungary for twenty-five years, was in Kenderes, a town not far from here.
    A smooth asphalt road leads directly to this town. The spire of the church guides pedestrians under the glow of the setting sun. We quickly found the former Horthy manor, right next to this church. Outside the iron gate is an avenue of trees, where residents of the town were forbidden to pass in the past. The manor house is not as magnificent as a palace; it is very similar to the manor of a mid-level Russian nobleman in the 19th century. It is said that this was the property Horthy's mother brought with her when she married. There are no mountains or rivers nearby, only an unremarkable plain. But Horthy had to return here every summer to stay for a few months, and finally to spend his birthday. Why? Because this place was where he was born and raised, just like Chiang Kai-shek to his hometown of Fenghua, believing that his good fortune to rise to prominence as a ruler was due to the good feng shui of his ancestral graves. It is said that Horthy's two sons also built manors here.
    What benefits did Horthy bring to the peasants? Margit, who used to be a maid on the manor, told me that every year in mid-May, before the Horthy family arrived at the manor, gendarmes were stationed in the town and the surrounding areas for several kilometers, with strict security. The regular 400 gendarmes plus the 400 in his entourage turned this small town into a gendarme town. Horthy would stay here for three months. The gendarmes had nothing to do, so they drank and made trouble. Peasants were beaten if they were not careful, and girls could not escape the gendarmes' abuse if they were not vigilant.
    So, how did Horthy spend his summers? He drank, hunted, swam, received guests, and came up with all kinds of ways to have fun every day…. His whole family, wanting to see the harvest on their estate, hired workers to lay two small tracks day and night, using five white horses to pull carriages with glass inlaid on all sides. The women wore light纱 scarves, and the gentlemen used telescopes to look at their vast fields, appreciating the golden waves of wheat like the sea. But they looked with disgust at those laborers who created these fruits on their land like serfs, and the thatched huts like pigsties. The gendarmes brutally drove away the emaciated, ragged children with bare feet herding sheep on the grass, fearing that the children's curiosity would hinder the dignity of the generals.
    The laborers living on Horthy's estate, in addition to being abused by the stewards, also suffered from the oppression of the gendarmes. If something didn't look right, or a word didn't sound right, people would be fired. Balint, who worked as a day laborer on Horthy's estate, said that he was only fourteen years old at the time. One evening, he innocently said, "The sun is setting." The gendarme heard it and told the steward, who fired him the next day. He had to go home and starve. The peasants of Kenderes town also had no way to find another master in other villages, because there were unemployed people everywhere, and there was a surplus of labor everywhere.
    In 1919, the dawn of the Soviets appeared on the plains through which the Tisza River flows, but then Horthy brought twenty-five years of darkness.
    In 1945, the day the peasants stood up finally arrived. Soviet troops entered Hungary. Under the leadership of the Hungarian Communists, the peasants were allocated land. After liberation, this manor was converted into a tractor teachers' school, and a new village for poor and lower-middle peasants was built around the manor's forest. Production cooperatives were organized on Horthy's land.
    The fate of the Horthy family was also destroyed along with the collapsed old regime. His two sons originally wanted to inherit their father's career and became senior officers. One was in the air force and died in a plane crash, and the other was in the army and died falling off a horse. A very delicate daughter died of lung disease early. What about Horthy's fate? When the Soviet army approached the Hungarian border in 1944, his confidence in Hitler's army wavered. He wanted to turn to Britain and the United States to sell himself, but Hitler found out, immediately removed him from his post, and sent him to Germany. Later, he lived in Portugal. During the October 1956 incident, he appealed to Eisenhower for help, asking the United States to help Hungary "protect human rights."
    Today, in Kenderes town, the old gatekeeper of the Horthy manor still lives, living in seclusion since liberation, often dreaming of the past glory and luxury. In October 1956, he became active. He dreamed that in the summer of 1957, Horthy would surely return to this manor in his majestic dark blue admiral's uniform, riding his favorite white horse to celebrate his late birthday. On the night when the old gatekeeper's son and the town's gendarmes and rich peasants organized the "Revolutionary Committee," he got out of bed in the middle of the night, took out the elaborate uniform hidden in the old boxes and tried it on again and again, measured it again and again, and woke up his old wife from her sleep, instructing her to repair and iron it early the next morning for urgent use.
    The dream of restoration was shattered. Not long after, the bad news of Horthy's death reached the ears of the old gatekeeper, his last hope was dashed, and he quietly pretended to be sick and lay in bed.

### 在从前的霍尔蒂庄园上

    在从前的霍尔蒂庄园上
    本报记者　胡济邦
    在蒂萨河流域的平原上，诞生了天才的革命诗人裴多菲。在这块肥沃而贫困的土地上，也曾经成长着为农民疾苦而呼号的伟大作家莫里兹。蒂萨河培育了人类高贵而纯洁的心灵，它是多么值得骄傲呀！可是不幸的是，在它的土地上也出生了一个暴政魔王，他污浊了这条像诗篇一样美丽的蒂萨河，他给匈牙利人民曾经带来无穷的苦难。
    当我们来到匈牙利东部索尔诺克州的一个小城基苏萨拉什时，我才知道统治匈牙利二十五年的法西斯独裁者霍尔蒂的出生地就在离此不远的康特勒斯镇。
    一条平滑的柏油大道直达这个小镇，教堂的尖顶在夕阳的光辉下指引着行人，我们很快地找到了从前的霍尔蒂的庄园，它就在这个教堂的旁边。铁栅门外有一片林荫道，过去镇上的居民都被禁止通行。庄园的房子并不像一座皇宫那样辉煌，它很像十九世纪俄罗斯的中等贵族地主的庄园。据说，这是霍尔蒂母亲出嫁时带来的产业。在这附近，既没有山，也没有水，只是一块平坦无奇的平原。但是霍尔蒂每年夏天必须回到这里住上几个月，最后度过他的生日的一天。这是为什么呢？就是因为这个地方是他出生发祥之地，正如蒋介石对他的奉化故乡一样，认为自己飞黄腾达成为统治者的幸运，是由于祖传坟地的好风水。据说，霍尔蒂的两个儿子也在这里建造了庄园。
    霍尔蒂给农民们带来什么好处呢？过去在庄园上当过女仆的玛尔吉特告诉我说：每到5月中旬，在霍尔蒂全家来到庄园以前，镇上和周围几公里的地方都驻上宪兵，戒备森严。常驻的四百人又加上随从的四百人，这样一个小镇就变成一个宪兵城了。霍尔蒂要在这里住上三个月，宪兵们无事可作，就酗酒闹事，农民们一不小心便遭毒打，姑娘们稍不提防就逃脱不了宪兵们的糟蹋。
    那么，霍尔蒂又怎样度过他的暑天呢？他天天饮酒、打猎、游泳、接待客人，还想出各种取乐的方法……。他的全家为要到自己的田庄上去看看收成，要雇工们日夜赶铺两条小轨道，用五匹白马拖曳着四面用玻璃镶起来的车厢，妇女们披着轻纱，老爷们用望远镜了望自己那广阔无垠的田野，欣赏着像海涛一般的黄金色的麦浪。但是他们厌恶地看着那些像农奴一般在他们的土地上创造这些果实的雇工们和像猪圈一样的茅舍。宪兵们凶暴地驱逐那些骨瘦如柴、衣衫褴褛、赤着两脚在草地上赶羊群的孩子，深怕孩子们的好奇心会妨碍将军们的尊严。
    在霍尔蒂田庄上生活着的雇工，除了受管事人的虐待之外，还要加上宪兵的压迫。一事看不顺眼，一句话听了不对头，就要把人解雇。一位在霍尔蒂田庄上当过零工的巴林说：那时他才十四岁，一个黄昏的时候，他无心地说了一句“太阳下山了。”宪兵听到就告诉了管事的，第二天就把他解雇了。他只得回家去挨饿。康特勒斯镇的农民也没有方法到别的村庄去另找主人，因为到处都有失业的人，到处都有剩余的劳动力。
    1919年，蒂萨河流过的平原上曾出现过苏维埃的曙光，可是，接着是霍尔蒂带来二十五年的黑暗日子。
    1945年，农民翻身的日子终于来到了。苏军进入了匈牙利境。农民们在匈牙利共产党人领导下分到了土地。解放以后，这个庄园已改为拖拉机师学校，庄园周围的一片林园已建起了一个贫雇农的新村。在霍尔蒂的田地上组织起了生产合作社。
    霍尔蒂一家的命运也随着崩溃了的旧政权一样毁灭了。他的两个儿子原来都想继承父亲的事业而当了高级军官，一个是空军，因飞机失事?死了，另一个儿子是陆军，骑马跌死了，还有一个娇嫩无比的女儿早因肺病死了。霍尔蒂的命运呢？当1944年苏军逼近匈牙利边境时，他对希特勒军队的信心发生了动摇，正想转向英美卖身投靠，却被希特勒发觉了，马上撤去他的职，并且把他遣送到德国去。后来，他在葡萄牙居住下来。1956年十月事件时，他曾向艾森豪威尔求援，要求美国帮助匈牙利“保护人类的权利”。
    今天，康特勒斯镇上，还住着霍尔蒂庄园的老门房，解放后他一直深居寡出，常常作着旧日威风豪华的春梦。1956年10月，他活跃起来了，他梦想着1957年夏天霍尔蒂一定又会穿着那深蓝色的海军上将的威武军装，骑着他那匹最心爱的白马回到这个庄园上来过他晚年的生日。当老门房的儿子和镇上的宪兵、富农组织了“革命委员会”的那个晚上，他在深夜里从床上爬起，把藏在旧箱笈中的那套讲究制服取出试了又试，量了又量，还把他的老妻从睡梦中唤醒，吩咐明天一早就得把它修整熨平，以备急需。
    复辟的美梦被粉碎了。过不多久，霍尔蒂死亡的噩耗也传到这位老门房的耳边，他的最后一点希望也破灭了，他就静悄悄地装病躺在床上。
