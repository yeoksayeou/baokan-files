Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th dispatch: The Shanghai Second People's Congress, Third Session, held on the 5th and 6th, issued a general mobilization order to the city's people to eliminate the "Seven Pests," calling on the city's seven million people to take swift action and comprehensively encircle and suppress the seven major pests: flies, mosquitoes, rats, sparrows, bedbugs, cockroaches, and snails. Shanghai Vice Mayor Liu Jiping suggested at the meeting that the people of the city should forge ahead, riding the waves, and launch a larger-scale patriotic health campaign centered on the elimination of the Four Pests. He announced that the goal of this movement is to basically transform Shanghai into a city without the "Seven Pests" within three years, and a completely "Seven-Without" city within five years.

Liu Jiping said: We must, with resolute revolutionary perseverance and with the revolutionary heroic spirit that shakes the mountains and rivers, eliminate the Seven Pests, just as we wage a life-and-death struggle against class enemies. He suggested that starting this year, three major inspections and appraisals should be conducted throughout the city before the Spring Festival, around the Dragon Boat Festival, and before National Day each year, and that these major inspections and appraisals should be established as a regular practice in Shanghai, passed down to our descendants for generations to come.

At the meeting, city people's representatives from all walks of life stated that they would take the lead in thoroughly eliminating the Seven Pests in their own units first. More than a hundred female representatives decided on the spot to launch a Shanghai-wide women's patriotic health movement day as the first battle in the march toward the "Seven Pests." People's representatives from factories such as Zhengtai Rubber Factory submitted proposals to the conference to basically achieve the combat goals of factories being free of mosquitoes, flies, and sparrows, and workers' dormitories being free of bedbugs within this year.

The meeting unanimously agreed that as long as the people of the city are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, all flies, mosquitoes, rats, sparrows, bedbugs, cockroaches, and snails will surely become our captives; scourges that have never been eradicated in human history will certainly be completely eliminated in our hands.

During the meeting, representatives from fifty-five factories, institutions, shops, neighborhood committees, and vendors sent a large number of battle pledges to the conference, vowing to completely eliminate the "Seven Pests."

    上海总动员消灭“七害”
    今年要进行三次大检查、大评比
    据新华社上海7日电　在5、6两日举行的上海市第二届人民代表大会第三次会议，向全市人民发出了消灭“七害”的总动员令，号召全市七百万人民，迅速行动起来，全面围剿苍蝇、蚊虫、老鼠、麻雀、臭虫、蟑螂、钉螺七大害虫。上海市副市长刘季平在会上建议全市人民乘风破浪前进，掀起一个更大规模的以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。他宣布这个运动的奋斗目标是：三年内把上海基本上变成一个没有“七害”的城市，五年内把上海变成一个彻底的“七无”城市。
    刘季平说：我们必须像对阶级敌人进行你死我活的斗争那样，以坚决的革命毅力，以气壮山河的革命英雄气概，消灭七害。他建议从今年起，每年春节前、端午节前后和国庆节前在全市进行三次大检查、大评比，并把这种大检查、大评比定为上海市的常规，传至我们的子孙万代。
    会上，来自各界的市人民代表纷纷表示要带头在本单位首先彻底除七害。一百多个女代表当场决定发起一个全上海妇女爱国卫生运动日，作为向“七害”进军的第一仗。正泰橡胶厂等工厂的人民代表向大会分别提出要在今年一年内基本上达到工厂无蚊、无蝇、无麻雀，工人宿舍无臭虫的战斗目标。
    会议一致认为只要全市人民人人鼓起革命的劲头，一切苍蝇、蚊虫、老鼠、麻雀、臭虫、蟑螂、钉螺都必将成为我们的俘虏；人类历史上从未能够铲除的祸害，一定会在我们手里被彻底消灭。
    在会议进行的时候，五十五个工厂、机关、商店、里弄、摊贩的代表向大会送来了大批彻底消除“七害”的战斗决心书。
