Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: The ever-strengthening friendly unity of Asian and African countries and the deep friendship of the peoples of Asian and African countries were once again embodied at the banquet held tonight by Egyptian Ambassador to China, Ragab, to welcome Crown Prince Badr, Deputy Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Yemen, and his entourage. Premier Zhou Enlai attended tonight's banquet.

    Crown Prince Badr said enthusiastically at the banquet that the relationship of allies of the Eastern people in the struggle for good and truth is a great relationship of solidarity. Egypt and China made great efforts at the Bandung Conference to strengthen the unity of the people of the participating countries and to achieve unanimous resolutions, and cooperated in their efforts to implement the resolutions of the Bandung Conference.

    Premier Zhou Enlai firmly declared at the banquet that resolutely supporting the struggle of the people of Yemen, Egypt, and other Arab countries against colonialism is the international obligation of the Chinese people. The struggle of the Arab people against colonialism and for the attainment and maintenance of national independence is our struggle, and the victory achieved by the Arab people in this just struggle is also our victory. He also said that the Yemeni people, who are heroically fighting imperialism, are by no means isolated. First, there are tens of millions of people in Arab countries who firmly support them, and the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world also firmly support them. Although there are still difficulties and twists and turns ahead, their struggle will surely be victorious.

    The host of tonight's banquet, Ambassador Ragab, also pointed out in his opening remarks that Asian-African unity and cooperation have emerged as a new factor, which has definitely shifted the balance of power between the peace-loving camp and the warmongers to the side of peace.

    At the banquet, to which ambassadors from eight Asian and African countries to China and the head of the Cambodian economic delegation, Yang Ann, were invited, Crown Prince Badr, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Ambassador Ragab, in their speeches looking forward to the prospects of friendly unity among Asian and African countries, were full of confidence in the future, unanimously emphasizing the importance of mutual visits by leaders of various countries, and sternly condemning the imperialists' conspiracies and aggressive activities to undermine the friendly unity of Asian and African countries.

    Crown Prince Badr said at the banquet that the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is a link in continuing the series of efforts we made at the Bandung Conference. We should continue to organize and guide these efforts in order to win a complete victory in the struggle against imperialism, in the struggle against the enemies of freedom and peace. He wished the solidarity of the people of Asian and African countries in the struggle would be strengthened day by day, and that the people of various countries would cooperate better in promoting truth, achieving freedom, and promoting comprehensive peace.

    In his speech at the banquet, Premier Zhou Enlai emphasized that Crown Prince Badr's visit has taken the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of Arab countries another step forward, and created a very good beginning for future mutual visits and contacts between the leaders of China and Arab countries. He also pointed out that the imperialists' recent conspiracies to carry out subversive activities in the Middle East and to brutally interfere in the affairs of the people of Arab countries in the Middle East are doomed to failure. The course of history will further prove that the will of the people of the world to demand peace will surely defeat the war and aggression conspiracies of the imperialist bloc.

    Ambassador Ragab also pointed out in his speech that Egypt's recent hosting of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference and Crown Prince Badr's visit to China have made important contributions to consolidating the strong barrier of Asian and African countries jointly resisting colonialism. He also hoped that other outstanding leaders of Arab countries would also visit China to strengthen the friendship and brotherhood between Asian and African countries.

    Crown Prince Badr, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Ambassador Ragab also warmly congratulated each other on the health of the leaders of the three countries in their speeches. Their speeches repeatedly aroused warm applause in the banquet hall.

    Also invited to attend tonight's banquet were Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and Vice President of the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association and Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association, Da Putsheng, and others.

    满怀信心展望亚非大团结的远景
    新华社11日讯　日益加强的亚非各国的友好团结和亚非各国人民的深厚友谊，再一次体现在今晚埃及驻中国大使拉加卜为欢迎也门王国副首相巴德尔王太子及其随行人员而举行的宴会上。周恩来总理出席了今晚的宴会。
    巴德尔王太子在宴会上热情地说，东方人民为争取美好和真理而斗争的同盟者的关系是一种伟大的团结关系。埃及和中国在万隆会议中为了加强与会各国人民的团结和使会议取得一致的决议，曾经作出巨大的努力，并且在努力执行万隆会议的决议方面进行了合作。
    周恩来总理在宴会上坚定地宣称：坚决支持也门、埃及和其他阿拉伯各国人民反殖民主义的斗争，是中国人民应尽的国际义务。阿拉伯各国人民反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争就是我们的斗争，阿拉伯各国人民在这个正义斗争中所取得的胜利也就是我们的胜利。他还说，正在同帝国主义进行英勇斗争的也门人民决不是孤立的，首先有阿拉伯各国的几千万人民坚决地支持他们，中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民也坚决地支持他们。尽管前面的道路还有困难和曲折，他们的斗争是一定会取得胜利的。
    今晚宴会的主人——拉加卜大使在宴会一开始首先致词时也指出，亚非团结合作已作为一个新的因素出现了，它已使爱好和平阵营和战争贩子之间的力量对比，肯定地侧向了和平的一边。
    在有八个亚非国家驻华使节和柬埔寨经济代表团团长杨安被邀参加的宴会上，巴德尔王太子、周恩来总理和拉加卜大使在讲话中展望亚非各国友好团结关系的远景时，都对未来充满信心，一致强调各国领导人相互访问的重要意义，并且严厉地谴责了帝国主义企图破坏亚非各国友好团结的阴谋和侵略活动。
    巴德尔王太子在宴会上说，亚非人民团结大会是继续我们在万隆会议中所作的一系列努力的一个环节，我们应该继续去组织和指导这些努力，以便在反对帝国主义的斗争里，在对自由、和平的敌人进行的斗争里获得全胜。他祝亚非各国人民在斗争中的团结日益加强，祝各国人民在发扬真理、实现自由和促进全面和平方面更好地合作。
    周恩来总理在宴会上的讲话中着重指出，巴德尔王太子的访问使中国人民同阿拉伯各国人民的友谊又向前发展了一步，并且为中国同阿拉伯各国的领导人今后的互相访问和接触，创造了一个非常良好的开端。他还指出，帝国主义最近企图在中东进行颠覆活动和横暴地干涉中东阿拉伯各国人民的事务的阴谋，注定是要失败的。历史的进程将会进一步证明，全世界人民要求和平的意志，一定会战胜帝国主义集团的战争和侵略的阴谋。
    拉加卜大使在讲话中也指出，埃及最近作为亚非团结大会的主人和巴德尔王太子的访问中国，已对巩固亚非国家共同抵抗殖民主义的坚强屏障作出了重要贡献。他并且希望阿拉伯国家的其他杰出领导人也来中国访问，以加强亚非国家的友谊和兄弟关系。
    巴德尔王太子、周恩来总理和拉加卜大使在讲话中还热情地互祝三国领导人的健康。他们的讲话一再引起宴会厅内不断的热烈的掌声。
    应邀出席今晚宴会的，还有陈毅副总理，外交部章汉夫副部长和中埃友好协会副会长、中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生等人。
