    Noble Qualities, Great Example
    Fang Heming's Moving Deeds Profoundly Educate Readers
    Determined to Use Comrade Fang Heming as the Standard to Thoroughly Purge My Thoughts in the Rectification Campaign

Editor Comrades:

    I read the January 5th People's Daily, fourth page, "Red Army Veteran Regimental Commander Disarms and Becomes a Farmer" report twice in a row. After reading it, my excited mood could not calm down. I am happy that our Party has such a party member. The noble qualities and high morality of a Communist Party member are embodied in him. Such a party member is truly a good son and daughter of the Party, worthy of being an old party member, a model among models, truly a model for us to learn from.

    Take the virtue of hard work and plain living, for example. He has maintained the Party's glorious tradition. The Party is now teaching us to build the country diligently and thriftily, manage our households diligently and thriftily, and run all undertakings diligently and thriftily. However, many comrades who have recently joined the revolutionary work have become extravagant and wasteful as soon as their lives improve. If their leather shoes are old or out of shape, they buy new ones. They have several pairs of woolen trousers, all kinds of woolen overcoats, silk quilts, etc., all complete. These people should carefully appreciate Comrade Fang Heming's words: "When suffering hardships, look forward and see the long-term prospects; when enjoying blessings, look back and don't forget your roots."

    To express my respect for Comrade Fang Heming, I cut out this news from the People's Daily and sent it to my wife, who is working and training in the countryside. Her health is not very good. When she was first sent down, she had concerns, fearing that her health would not allow her to work. After organizational education and my help, she finally went down happily. I used a red pen to highlight Fang Heming's ill health, the number of times he had been injured, and the fact that he still works hard, in order to draw her attention to it. Fang Heming is a regimental commander, a veteran cadre, and an old Communist Party member. He fought north and south for the Party and the people, risking his life and death, and was injured seven times, and today he is still fighting on the labor front. Can't a young person who is slightly weaker physically work?

    Reading Comrade Fang Heming's actions also made me deeply ashamed of my ideological problems. ... I am a Communist Party member, and I am determined to thoroughly purge my old thoughts in this rectification campaign. I am willing to use Comrade Fang Heming as an example and standard to examine myself.

    Looking at Comrade Fang Heming's Moving Deeds
    University Students Shouldn't Still Be Unsatisfied

Editor Comrades:

    Your newspaper's report on the deeds of Red Army veteran regimental commander Comrade Fang Heming was read by me and my classmates over and over again, and our hearts were both excited and ashamed. He said: "Who says it's not worth it? I used to be a hired laborer for others, oppressed and poor for generations. I joined the revolution, defeated the enemy, and now I have returned to my own land to labor and produce. This is worth it! If you say this is not worth it, then the comrades who sacrificed themselves are even less worth it. If everyone planned like you, where would today's revolutionary victory come from?" When I read this passage, I felt very sad. I thought, today we are studying in universities, enjoying the happiness that the martyrs exchanged with their blood and sacrifice, enjoying the fruits accumulated by the hard work of the working people. We live in tall buildings, eat two meals of white rice a day, and the state supports us with scholarships. We not only have no worries about food and clothing, but also have state-funded treatment when we get sick, and the state also subsidizes us to buy books. Calculated, the state spends about 1,600 yuan a year on each of us university students. However, some of us are still dissatisfied. They complain that the accommodation is crowded, the food is not to their taste, and the heating is too low. Some students enjoy higher adjusted scholarship assistance. They do not know how to save and spend their money wisely. When they run out of money, they apply to the state for subsidies if their families have difficulties. Some even spend the family subsidies, thinking that they have contributed to the revolution and deserve preferential treatment. How can these people's consciences not be condemned when they compare themselves with Comrade Fang Heming? I strongly support the Ministry of Higher Education's decision to seriously control the use of scholarships in universities. The principle of running schools diligently and thriftily must be earnestly implemented. This is not only a matter of saving state expenditures, but also related to the ideological transformation of university students.

    Finally, I hope to widely publicize the deeds of Comrade Fang Heming and suggest that relevant departments organize writers and painters to conduct interviews so that more people can learn from his example.

    Gave Me a Loud Wake-Up Call
    Determined to Restore the Tradition of Hard Work and Plain Living

Editor Comrades:

    Reading the report on Red Army veteran regimental commander Fang Heming made me very moved. In particular, the old regimental commander's decades-long deeds of hard work and plain living left an indelible impression on my mind.

    I am a staff member of a state agency. Before liberation, I was born into a poor peasant family and lived a life of eating chaff and wild vegetables. I once suffered from not being able to defecate because I ate too much chaff, and I also suffered from red swelling all over my body because I ate poisonous wild vegetables. However, after liberation, in the days of enjoying happiness, I forgot all of this and completely lost the fine tradition of hard work and plain living, and my life began to be hedonistic and corrupt. Since the state implemented wage reform in 1956, the desire to improve personal life has begun to grow without limit. In terms of clothing, I wear new clothes and not old ones, and I wear good clothes and not inferior ones. I don't want to wear coarse cloth clothes, I want to wear fine cloth ones; I don't want to wear plain cloth, I want to wear twill and worsted. Gradually, these cloths are no longer fresh, and I want to wear more woolen fabrics. I have already made a plan to buy a decent navy blue uniform in 1958. In terms of eating, I buy whatever is delicious when the canteen opens. Sometimes the monthly food expenses reach twenty-four yuan. The development of this personal enjoyment ideology has made me become uninterested in other things. I don't want to participate in the mutual aid savings association for one yuan a month. I think, "What's the point of participating in that? With that one yuan, I can still eat it!" Although I bought 30 yuan of public bonds last year, it was not entirely out of my own initiative, but because I thought, "Everyone has bought them, and if I don't buy them or buy less, it will look bad."

    Reading the old regimental commander's deeds gave me a loud wake-up call. I found that I was thinking too much about personal enjoyment, forgetting the Party's tradition of hard work and plain living, and forgetting the fine qualities of hard work and plain living that a working person should have.

    This time, the state's issuance of economic construction bonds, I think, is the first test of my ideological transformation. I want to take Fang Heming's spirit as my example. I can save eight or nine yuan to ten yuan a month, and I will never spend it indiscriminately like before. I will definitely not buy the woolen uniform that I originally planned to buy. I will not buy new cotton-padded shoes, and I can repair the old ones. I originally planned to buy a new satin quilt, but I will not buy it. I also don't want to buy two worsted uniforms, just wash and dye the old ones. In this way, although my family will soon be adding a new member, we still have the strength to buy one hundred yuan of public bonds. Therefore, on January 10, when all the staff of our Handan Daily bought public bonds, I bought one hundred yuan of economic construction bonds. Zhang Qingzhi

    In Front of Comrade Fang Heming
    I Feel Small, I Feel Ashamed

Editor Comrades:

    After reading the moving report in the January 5th People's Daily about Comrade Fang Heming's disarming and becoming a farmer, my heart was excited and I could not calm down for a long time. This veteran revolutionary fighter fought, bled, risked his life, and died for the Party and the people's cause before liberation for twenty years as if it were just one day. After liberation, he shared weal and woe with the masses and worked together to produce. Comrade Fang Heming's spirit of wholeheartedly dedicating himself to the Party and the people embodies the noble qualities of a Communist Party member. This tells us who a person should live for and how they should live.

    Comrade Fang Heming fought for the people for twenty years, was injured seven times, and received thirteen awards. After liberation, not only did he not ask the Party for anything, but on the contrary, when the Party took care of his failing health and wanted him to take a rest, he asked to participate in labor. Finally, he returned home with 500 catties of millet as a resettlement allowance and a small roll of luggage. After returning home, he encountered great difficulties in life. Even in such times, what he thought of was not how the state should take care of him, but always realized the difficulties of the state and how he could do more for the state. How can this quality of wholeheartedly forgetting personal interests for the sake of the Party and the people not move people and be deeply educated? I have only worked for the Party for a few years, and I use this as capital to bargain with the Party for care in a loud voice. If I don't get satisfaction, I am still dissatisfied. In front of Comrade Fang Heming, I feel small, I feel ashamed.

### 崇高的品质　伟大的榜样  方和明的动人事迹使读者受到深刻教育

    崇高的品质　伟大的榜样
    方和明的动人事迹使读者受到深刻教育
    决心以方和明同志为标准在整风中清算自己的思想编辑同志：
    1月5日人民日报第四版“红军老团长解甲当农民”的报道，我一连看了两遍。看后，我激动的心情不能平静下来。我为我们党有这样的党员而高兴。共产党员高贵的品质，高尚的道德在他的身上体现出来了。像这样的党员真是党的好儿女，不愧为老党员，模范中的模范，真是我们学习的榜样。
    就拿艰苦朴素这一美德来说吧，他是保持了党的光荣传统的。党现在教导我们，要勤俭建国，勤俭持家，勤俭办一切事业。但是有许多新参加革命工作的同志，生活刚一改善就铺张浪费起来了。皮鞋旧了，走了样就另买新的。呢裤子好几条，什么呢子短大衣，绸缎被面等等，一应俱全。这些人应该好好体会一下方和明同志的这几句话：“吃苦的时候要朝前看，看远景，享福的时候要朝后看，别忘本。”
    为了表示我对方和明同志的敬意，我把人民日报这一消息剪了下来，寄给下放到农村正在劳动锻炼的我的爱人。她身体不大好，刚下放时，思想有顾虑，怕身体不好，劳动不了。后经组织教育和我的帮助，总算愉快的下去了，我把方和明同志身体不好，负过多少次伤，仍然艰苦地劳动这一段话，用红笔特别划了出来，以便引起她的重视。方和明是个团长、老干部、老共产党员，为党为人民南征北战，出生入死，负伤七次，今天仍然在劳动战线上斗争着。难道一个身体稍微瘦弱一些的年轻人，就不能劳动吗？
    看了方和明同志的行动，也使我深为自己的思想毛病惭愧。……我是一个共产党员，我下决心要在这一次整风中要好好地把自己的旧思想清算一番。我愿以方和明同志为榜样和标准来检查自己。

    看看方和明同志这些动人事迹
    大学生不应该还有什么不满足编辑同志：
    你报关于红军老团长方和明同志事迹的报道，我和同学们读了一遍又一遍，内心既激动，又惭愧。他说：“谁说划不来呢？我过去给人家当长工，受压迫，几辈子受穷，我参加革命，打垮了敌人，现在回到自己的土地上劳动生产，这才划得来嗳！若说这划不来，牺牲了的同志更划不来，假若都照你那样打算，今天的革命胜利从哪里来？”当我读到这一段话时，心内感觉十分难过。我想，今天我们在大学里读书，享受着先烈们流血牺牲换来的幸福，享受着劳动人民辛勤劳动积累起来的果实。住的是高楼大厦，一天吃两顿白米饭，国家用助学金供养着我们，不但吃不愁，穿不愁，生了病，有国家给治疗，要买书，国家还有补助。计算下来，国家在我们一个大学生身上，每年要花费一千六百元左右。可是，我们中间还有些人不满足，他们嫌住的挤了，嫌吃的不合味口，嫌暖气的温度太低。有些同学享受更高的调干助学金，他们一点不知省吃俭用，自己把钱用完了，家庭有困难又向国家申请补助。个别的甚至把家庭补助也拿来花了，认为这是自己对革命有过贡献，享受优厚待遇是理所应得。这些人拿方和明同志比比，他们的良心不知要受到怎样的责备？我非常拥护高教部关于认真掌握高等学校助学金使用的决定，勤俭办学的方针必须认真贯彻执行，这不仅是要节约国家开支的问题，而且也关系着对大学生的思想改造。
    最后，我希望广泛地宣传方和明同志的事迹，建议有关部门组织作家、画家去进行采访，让更多的人来学习他的榜样。

    给我敲了一下响亮的警钟
    决心恢复艰苦朴素的传统编辑同志：
    读了红军老团长方和明的报道，使我非常感动。特别是老团长艰苦朴素几十年如一日的事迹留在我脑子里的印象，久久不能淡忘。
    我是国家机关的一个工作人员，解放前，生在一个贫农的家庭里，过的是吃糠、吃野菜的日子。曾经因为吃糠多了，拉不出屎来，也曾因为吃了有毒的野菜而致混身红肿。可是，在解放以后，在享福的日子里，我却把这些都忘了，完全丢失了艰苦朴素的优良作风，生活开始享乐腐化起来。自1956年国家实行工资改革以后，改善个人生活的欲望开始无止境地增长起来。在穿的方面，我是见新不穿旧，见好不穿次。粗布衣服不愿穿，愿穿细布的；平面市布不愿意穿，愿穿斜纹的和华达呢的。渐渐的，这些布穿着也觉不怎么新鲜，又想更多地穿毛呢料子了。我已定好计划，在1958年买一套像样的海军呢制服。在吃的方面，食堂一开饭，什么好吃买什么。有时一个月的伙食费达到二十四元。这种个人享受思想的发展，使我对另外一些事却变得不关心了。互助储金会每月拿一元钱，我都不愿参加了，心想：“参加那个干什么呀，有那一元钱我还吃它哩！”去年我虽然买了三十元公债，但却不是完全出于自觉，而是认为“大家都买了，
  自己不买或是买的少了显得不好看。”
    看了老团长的事迹，给我敲了一下响亮的警钟。我发觉我为个人享受考虑得太多了，忘记了党的艰苦朴素的传统，忘记了一个劳动人民应有的艰苦朴素的优良品质。
    这次国家发行经济建设公债，我觉得是对我思想转变的第一个考验。我要以方和明的精神当作自己的榜样。我每月能节余八、九元至十元钱，坚决不像以前那样乱花了。我原计划要买的毛呢料制服，现在坚决不买了。新皮棉鞋我也不买了，把旧的修理修理就可以了。原来我打算买个新缎面被也不买了。想买两件华达呢常穿制服也不买了，把旧的洗洗染染就行了。这样，我家虽然很快就要增加一口人，买一百元的公债还是有力量。因此，1月10日当我们邯郸日报社全体人员买公债时，我就买了一百元的经济建设公债。　　张庆芝
    在方和明同志的面前
    我感到渺小感到羞愧
    编辑同志：
    我看了1月5日人民日报有关方和明同志解甲当农民的动人报道后，心里激动，很久不能平息。这位老革命战士在解放前为党为人民的事业战斗、流血，出生入死，二十年如一日。解放后又和群众同甘共苦，一起劳动生产。方和明同志这种全心全意的对党对人民的献身精神，表现了一个共产党员的崇高品质。这告诉我们，一个人应该为谁活着，应该怎样活着。
    方和明同志为人民打了二十年的天下，负过七次伤，受过十三次奖励，在解放以后，他不但没有伸手向党要过什么，相反的，当党照顾他身体衰弱，要让他去休养时，他却提出要求去参加劳动。最后，领了五百斤小米的安家费和一小卷行李就回到了家里。到家以后，生活上碰到很大的困难，就是在这样的时候，他想到的，也不是国家应该怎样照顾他，而是时时体会到国家的困难，自己怎样才能为国家多尽一分力量。这种一心一意为党为人民而完全忘掉个人私利的品质，怎能不使人感动并深深受到教育呢？我为党工作不过几年，就以此为资本，振振有词地向党讨价还价要求照顾，得不到满足还不满意。在方和明同志面前，我感到渺小，我感到羞愧。
