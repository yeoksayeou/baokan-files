Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 23rd: Striving to accumulate human waste and urine in every possible way is a prominent focus of the current fertilizer accumulation movement in the rural areas of Liaoning Province.

As of the end of 1957, statistics show that more than 1.6 million toilets have been built in the rural areas of the province, rapidly changing the past undesirable habit of having no toilets and excrement and urine everywhere. In order to avoid the reduction of fertilizer efficiency due to evaporation and seepage of feces and urine, and to benefit environmental hygiene, 600,000 toilets have been fitted with large vats and sheds. Most of the other toilets are built of stone or brick, and some are sealed with cement. In addition, thousands of public toilets and simple temporary toilets have been built in the fields and along the roads. The work of accumulating human urine for topdressing is also being carried out in some areas. In the agricultural cooperatives of only five counties, such as Lingyuan, Chaoyang, and Changtu, 49,000 large urine storage pools have been established, with special personnel collecting the human urine accumulated by the members of the cooperatives, and encouraging the members to build urine tanks for accumulation through cash purchases and conversion into labor work points.

According to tests and key experiments conducted by the Liaoning Provincial Agricultural and Health Departments, on average, each person excretes more than 700 jin of feces and urine per year, containing more than 4 jin of nitrogen, which is equivalent to the fertilizer efficiency of 20 jin of ammonium sulfate. Using it to fertilize the fields can increase grain production by 60 jin to 140 jin. If the feces and urine of all 23 million people in the province are fully utilized, it will be equivalent to two and a half times the total amount of ammonium sulfate applied annually in the province, which can guarantee an increase in grain production of 640,000 tons.

    辽宁农村广泛修厕所
    千方百计积攒人粪尿
    新华社沈阳23日电　千方百计地积攒人粪尿，是当前辽宁省农村积肥运动中比较突出的一个重点。
    截止1957年末统计，全省农村已修建起一百六十多万个厕所，迅速改变过去农村人无厕、到处是屎尿的不良习惯。为了避免粪尿因蒸发、渗透而减低肥效，并且有利于环境卫生，已有六十万个厕所下了大缸，还设了棚盖。其它厕所多半是用石头或砖砌成的，有的用水泥抹了缝。另外，还在地头、路旁修了成千上万的公共厕所和简单的临时厕所。单攒人尿以备追肥的工作也在部分地区开展起来，仅凌源、朝阳、昌图等五县的农业社，就建立了四万九千个大贮尿池，设专人收集社员所积的人尿，并以现金收买和折合劳动工分的办法，鼓励社员建立尿罐积攒。
    据辽宁省农业和卫生部门化验和重点试验证明，平均每口人每年排出的粪和尿约七百多斤，含氮量在四斤以上，相当于二十斤硫铵的肥效，用来肥田可增产粮食六十斤到一百四十斤。如果把全省二千三百万人的粪尿全部利用起来，等于现在全省每年施用硫铵总量的两倍半，可以保证增产粮食六十四万吨。
