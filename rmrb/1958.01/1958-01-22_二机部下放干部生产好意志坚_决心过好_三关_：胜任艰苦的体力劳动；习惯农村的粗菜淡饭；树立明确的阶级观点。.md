Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The first group of cadres from the Second Ministry of Machine Building who have been transferred to the countryside have, after a month of training, expressed their confidence and determination to overcome the "three tests" on the labor front, and temper themselves into state organ cadres who can withstand risks.

The so-called "three tests" are strenuous physical labor, coarse rural food, and class stand and class line.

This group of transferred cadres from the Second Ministry of Machine Building totals six hundred people, and they departed for the rural areas of Hebei Province around December 10, 1957. Recently, the leaders of this ministry conducted an inspection of their labor and living conditions after being transferred. According to the investigation, after a month of practical training in rural life, most of the transferred cadres quickly broke through the stage of "backache and sore muscles, blisters on hands," and achieved high spirits and enjoyable labor. They expressed their determination to, in the common life of eating, living, and working alongside the peasants, accustom themselves to the current frugal life of coarse rural food, establish a clear class stand and the viewpoint of relying on the masses, and be able to sharply distinguish right from wrong. Many people also pointed out that only by passing the first two tests can one pass the last test, and the last test is a sign of how well a state organ cadre has been reformed.

In the past month, most of the transferred cadres in this ministry have begun to initially grasp the main current agricultural tasks. Among the 193 people assigned to Jiaoxian County, 121 were evaluated by the local Party committee and peasants as "three good" cadres who are active in labor, can humbly learn from the peasants, and have established close relationships with the peasants. Li Nianci, a transferred cadre from the General Office, had never participated in labor before, and when participating in voluntary labor in the office, he felt dizzy as soon as he was slightly tired. Now, not only does he complete his tasks smoothly every time, but his body has also become stronger, and when participating in manure delivery work, he earns 15 work points every day, reaching the highest record of work points earned by local farmers every day. Technician Yang Zhenji, in order to help the peasants do a good job in the long-term planning of water conservancy construction, braved the biting cold wind and walked more than 200 li for two days and two nights without rest, taking 24 kinds of water samples from rivers and wells throughout the county. Long Zhixian, who was assigned to the Shuangmiao Township Agricultural Cooperative as the production team leader, used his exemplary actions to transform a lazy man who was well-known throughout the township, creating a new record of more than one zhang deep well digging per day for the whole team of four people. Now, the story of the transferred cadre Long Zhixian transforming the lazy man has spread throughout the entire district.

The peasants' enthusiastic care for the transferred cadres has moved the transferred cadres very much. Many peasants, upon hearing that transferred cadres were coming to live in their homes, cleaned their houses spotlessly, spread new matting on the kang, and some landlords even cut window decorations out of red colored paper and pasted them on the newly papered windows. The transferred cadre Yin Jiaji lived in the home of a "Five Guarantees" household. The old landlady of this household treated Yin Jiaji as her own son, and when he set off for work in the early morning, the old lady would always send him outside the village; when he came home from work in the evening, she would prepare meals early and personally pick up Yin Jiaji at the edge of the village. Yin Jiaji was moved to tears by this situation. Not only did he get up before dawn every day to sweep the courtyard for the landlord and fill the water tank, but he also helped three or five nearby households that lacked labor to clean and carry water. Female cadre Chang Xiuqin slept on the same kang with the old landlady, and they addressed each other as mother and daughter on weekdays, and their lives were indistinguishable from each other. Recently, Chang Xiuqin asked for leave to return to Beijing to visit her sick child. When the old landlady found out, she made dumplings for Chang Xiuqin overnight, and the next morning she walked a long way to personally deliver them to the bus. Before leaving, she held Chang Xiuqin's hand and said, "Child, you must come home soon."

In addition to actively participating in labor, the transferred cadres of the Second Ministry of Machine Building also contributed their knowledge to the countryside. By the beginning of this year, nearly 200 cadres from this ministry distributed in 22 townships had helped the peasants establish two amateur middle schools, one amateur accounting school, and eight amateur primary schools. Many cadres labor during the day and serve as teachers at night. Some cadres work all day and still help the cooperative sort out accounts until late at night.

In the past month, there were also a very few cadres whose lifestyle was not good and were criticized by the peasants. One female cadre bought more than 30 jin of red dates from the peasants at a price of two cents per jin higher than the state's purchase price, intending to use them to improve her life. There were also individual cadres who went to the market town to eat at small restaurants. The peasants criticized such cadres, believing that although they were good at labor, they were still very far away from them in their thinking.

Although many transferred cadres had learned some knowledge about class struggle from their work in organs and from books in the past, once they delved into the scene of mass struggle, they deeply realized that they still needed to greatly improve their political consciousness and ability to distinguish right from wrong. One cadre, while helping the cooperative sort out accounts in his spare time, was threatened by bad elements, and did not dare to expose the loopholes in the accounts immediately, but only told another transferred cadre about it after a long time. Transferred cadres assigned to Jiaoxian County, upon hearing someone say that digging wells and canals was a "waste of effort," relayed this opinion upwards without distinguishing it. After the local Party committee and some rural activists explained, they realized that these words were wrong, and also learned that those who held these opinions were some people who were skeptical about cooperativization and the production upsurge, and some were landlords and rich peasant elements who were deliberately provoking and sabotaging.

According to this inspection, the leading cadres of the Second Ministry of Machine Building also deeply felt that it is necessary to continue to conduct in-depth education on the rural class line for the transferred cadres in the future, and emphasized that not only should the transferred cadres be educated to do a good job in labor and have good relations with the masses, but they must also pay special attention to the tempering of their own ideological stand.

    二机部下放干部生产好意志坚
    决心过好“三关”：
    胜任艰苦的体力劳动；习惯农村的粗菜淡饭；树立明确的阶级观点。
    新华社讯　第二机械工业部首批已下放农村的干部，经过一个月的锻炼，他们表示有信心和决心在劳动战线上跨过“三关”，把自己锻炼成经得起风险的国家机关干部。
    所谓“三关”就是艰苦的体力劳动、农村的粗菜淡饭、阶级立场和阶级路线。
    第二机械工业部这批下放干部共有六百人，是在1957年12月10日前后出发到河北省农村的。最近，这个部领导上对他们下放后的劳动和生活情况作了一次检查。根据调查了解，下放干部经过一个月农村生活的实际锻炼，多数人都很快在体力劳动中突破“腰酸背痛、手掌生泡”的阶段，做到精神饱满和劳动愉快，他们表示有决心在和农民同吃同住同劳动的共同生活中，使自己习惯于目前农村粗菜淡饭的俭朴生活，树立起明确的阶级立场和依靠群众的观点，能够尖锐地明辨是非。许多人还指出，只有过好前两关才能过好最后一关，而最后一关又是一个国家机关干部改造得好坏的标志。
    一个月来，这个部的大部分下放干部已开始能初步掌握当前的主要农务。在分配到交河县的一百九十三人中，就有一百二十一人被当地党委和农民评比为劳动积极、能向农民虚心学习、同农民已建立亲密关系的“三好”干部。办公厅下放干部李念慈过去从来没有参加过劳动，在机关内参加义务劳动时，稍一疲劳就觉得头晕。现在，他不但每次都顺利完成任务，身体已锻炼得健壮起来，并且在参加送粪工作时，每天挣得十五个工分，达到当地农民每天所得工分的最高纪录。技术员杨振基为了帮助农民搞好兴修水利的长远规划，曾经冒着刺骨的寒风，两天两夜没有休息，走了两百多里路，从全县的河流和水井里取来二十四种水样。被分配在双庙乡农业社担任生产小队长的龙志先，曾经用自己的模范行动，使得他队里一个全乡闻名的懒汉转变过来，创造了全小队四人一天打井一丈多深的新纪录。现在，下放干部龙志先改造懒汉的故事已传遍了全区。
    农民们对下放干部的热情关怀，使下放干部很感动。许多农民听说有下放干部到自己家里来住，都把屋子收拾得干干净净，铺上新的炕席，有的房东还用红彩纸剪了窗花，贴在新糊过的窗户上。下放干部尹家基住在一家五保户家里。这家房东老奶奶就把尹家基当作亲儿子看待，清晨出发劳动，老奶奶总要把他送到村外；傍晚收工时，她又及早做好饭，亲自到村边把尹家基接回家来。尹家基对于这种情形，感动得掉泪，他不仅每天天蒙亮就起床，替房东扫净住院，挑满水缸，并且还要帮助附近三、五家劳动力缺乏的农户打扫和挑水。女干部常秀琴同房东老大娘睡在一个炕上，她们平日母女相称，生活上已不分彼此。最近常秀琴因为自己的小孩生病，请假回北京探望，房东老大娘知道后，连夜给常秀琴包了饺子，第二天清晨又走很远的路亲自送上汽车，临行前还把着常秀琴的手说：“孩子，你千万要早日回家来。”
    第二机械部的下放干部除积极参加劳动外，同时把自己的知识贡献给农村。到今年初，这个部分布在二十二个乡的将近两百名干部，已经帮助农民建立了两所业余中学，一所业余会计学校和八所业余小学。许多干部白天劳动，夜晚担任教员。有的干部白天劳动一天，晚上还帮助合作社整理账目，直到深夜。
    在过去的一个月中，也还有极少数干部在生活作风上表现不好，受到农民的批评。有一个女干部用每斤比国家收购价格高两分钱的价钱，向农民买了三十多斤红枣，准备用来改善生活。也有个别干部到集镇上去吃小馆子。对于这样的干部，农民对他们提出了批评，认为他们虽然劳动还好，但在思想上和他们还有很大距离。
    许多下放干部过去虽然从机关工作和书本上学习到一些有关阶级斗争的知识，可是一旦深入到群众斗争的现场以后，他们就深刻地体会到自己还需要大大提高政治觉悟和明辨是非的能力。有个干部在劳动之余帮助合作社整理账目时，受到坏分子的威胁，发现了账目上的漏洞也不敢马上揭发，过了许久才向另一个下放干部谈出来。被分配到交河县的下放干部，听到有人说打井挖渠是“白费工”，就不加分辨地把这种意见向上反映。经过当地党委和一些农村积极分子的解释，他们才知道这些话是错误的，并且也了解到持这些意见的都是一些对合作化和生产高潮抱有怀疑的人，有的还是地主、富农分子别有用心的挑拨破坏。
    根据这次检查，第二机械工业部领导干部也深切地感到今后必须继续对下放干部深入进行有关农村阶级路线的教育，并且强调指出不但要教育下放干部做到劳动好、同群众关系好，并且要特别注意自己思想立场的锻炼。
