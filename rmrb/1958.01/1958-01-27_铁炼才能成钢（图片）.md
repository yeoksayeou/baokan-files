Iron Must be Tempered into Steel
Iron cannot become steel without tempering. The first group of cadres from the Ministry of Commerce who were sent to Jixian County, Hebei Province, to participate in physical labor, have become increasingly enthusiastic about labor after a month of training. When people were initially sent down to participate in labor training, they inevitably had concerns, one of which was the fear of not being able to endure the hardship of labor. The experience of the sent-down cadres from the Ministry of Commerce has proven that a strong will can overcome all hardships. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zheng Zhensun photographed.
	How proud it is to apply knowledge to rural construction! The sent-down cadres from the Ministry of Commerce participated in the preparatory work for the natural environment plan in Guanzhuang Township. This is a chart of Henan Province's experience in managing the Mang River that the sent-down cadres are studying. They will participate in the planning work based on this chart.
	During the recent cold wave, cadres sent down to Guanzhuang Township and commune members worked together to rush the construction of a small reservoir.
	A month of labor has yielded a bountiful harvest in physical strength and in thought. Sent-down cadres from the Ministry of Commerce (from left: Chen Qingchun, Lu Yongshan, Zhang Ruohu, Cai Ruixue, Wang Guoying) take out their scorebooks to compare who has worked the best.
	Wang Huimin (left) and Shen Jin'e, cadres sent down to Balizhuang Township, found it difficult for two people to carry water when they first started working; after some days of training, Wang Huimin now does not find it very difficult to carry water alone.

    铁炼才能成钢
    铁不炼不成钢。商业部第一批下放到河北省蓟县参加体力劳动的干部，经过一个月的锻炼，劳动热情越来越高。最初人们下放参加劳动锻炼时，思想上总免不了顾虑，其中之一就是恐怕吃不消劳动的艰苦。商业部下放干部的经验证明了坚强的意志可以克服一切艰苦。　新华社记者　郑震孙摄
    把知识用于农村建设是多么令人自豪！商业部下放干部参加了官庄乡自然环境计划的准备工作。这是下放干部正在看河南省治理漭河经验的图表，他们将根据这张图表参与规划工作。
    在前些日子，寒潮袭来的时候，下放到官庄乡的干部和社员们一起赶修小水库。
    一月来的劳动，在体力上得到丰收，思想上也得到丰收。商业部下放干部（左起：陈庆春、陆永珊、张若虎、才锐学、汪国瑛）他们拿出记分本，比比谁劳动得最好。
    下放到八里庄乡的干部王惠敏（左）和沈金娥刚刚从事劳动时，两个人抬水还感觉吃力；经过一些日子的锻炼，现在王惠敏一人挑水也不很费劲了。
