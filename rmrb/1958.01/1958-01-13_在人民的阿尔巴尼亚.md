    In the People's Albania
        Cultivating Technical Personnel
    In order to better meet the needs of industry, agriculture, and other sectors, the Albanian Labor Party and the government pay special attention to the cultivation of technical personnel. To this end, in addition to universities and higher education institutions training various engineers, agronomists, doctors, and other experts, many ordinary middle schools and twenty-three secondary technical schools are also training large numbers of mechanics, electricians, geologists, animal husbandry experts, and doctor's assistants, etc.
    In addition, Albania has established many technical cram schools to improve the technical level of existing employees.
      Number of State-Owned Farms Increases
    The number of state-owned farms in Albania is constantly increasing. At present, there are twenty-three state-owned farms nationwide. Each farm invests heavily in large-scale modernization every year. In the past decade, the total investment in various farms has reached 1.451 billion lek. The investment in 1957 increased by 62% compared to 1956. In recent years, about 2,600 households and 2,400 single people among the state-owned farm employees have moved into new homes.
    During the Second Five-Year Plan, the area of the farms will expand by 56% compared to the First Five-Year Plan. By 1960, the various agricultural and animal husbandry products that state-owned farms hand over to the state will increase significantly: grain will increase by 158%, cotton will increase by more than eight times, tobacco will increase by two and a half times, potatoes will increase by 265%, and milk will increase by 62%.
    Women Actively Participate in Social Activities
    Under the people's democratic system, Albanian women actively participate in the work of government departments. Before liberation, Albanian women had no rights or social status. But now women have their due status in society and have equal rights with men in all political and social sectors. There are sixteen female representatives in the People's Assembly, more than 1,600 female members in people's committees at all levels, and more than 400 female judges and jurors. Now, more than 20% of the staff in the trade sector are women, 45% in the education sector, and 45.8% in health institutions. Women's rights are protected by law. There is a paid maternity leave of two and a half to three months after childbirth. Mothers with many children also receive state subsidies. In recent years alone, the state has spent approximately 760 million lek in this regard. (Attached picture)

    在人民的阿尔巴尼亚
        培养技术人员
    为了更好地满足工业、农业和其他部门的需要，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府特别注意技术人员的培养。为此，除了大学和各高等学院在培养各种工程师、农学家、医生和其他专家外，还有许多普通中学和二十三所中等技术学校也在大量地培养各种机械师、电工、地质工作者、畜牧业专家和医生助手等。
    此外，阿尔巴尼亚还建立了很多技术补习学校，以提高现有职工的技术水平。
      国营农场数目增加
    阿尔巴尼亚国营农场的数目在不断的增加。目前，全国已有二十三个国营农场。各农场每年都以大量投资来进行大规模的现代化建设。最近十年内，各农场的投资共达十四亿五千一百万列克。1957年的投资比1956年增加了62％。最近几年内，国营农场职工中约有二千六百户和二千四百个单身者搬入新居。
    在第二个五年计划期间，农场的面积还要比第一个五年计划时扩大56％。到1960年，国营农场交给国家的各种农牧产品将大大增加：粮食增加158％，棉花增加八倍多，烟草增加二倍半，马铃薯增加265％，牛奶增加62％。
    妇女积极参加社会活动
    在人民民主制度下，阿尔巴尼亚妇女积极地参加政府部门的工作。解放前，阿尔巴尼亚妇女没有任何权利和社会地位。但是现在妇女在社会上已有了应有的地位，无论在政治或社会各部门都有了和男子平等的权利。在人民议会中有十六位女代表，在各级人民委员会中有一千六百多名女委员，另外还有四百多名女法官和女陪审员。现在，在贸易部门里20％以上的工作人员是妇女，在教育部门中则有45％是妇女，在卫生机关中有45.8％，妇女的权利受到法律的保护。生育后有两个半月到三个月工资照发的假期。多子女母亲还受到国家的补助，仅仅在最近几年内，国家在这方面就支出了约七亿六千万里克。（附图片）
