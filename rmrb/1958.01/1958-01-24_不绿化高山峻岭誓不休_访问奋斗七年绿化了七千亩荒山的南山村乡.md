    Vowing Not to Rest Until High Mountains and Ridges are Greened
    —Visiting Nanshancun Township, Which Has Struggled for Seven Years to Green 7,000 Mu of Barren Mountains
    By Our Reporter Chen Bowei
    In the winter, when green is most scarce, we visited a village that is being greened—Nanshancun Township, Pinggu County, Hebei Province. The winter natural environment meant that we saw relatively little green; however, this village's great achievement of greening barren mountains and ridges was enough to show us the youthful vitality displayed by the heroic people in transforming nature's appearance.
    Good Scenery
    It was early in the year when we went to Nanshancun with Comrade Xiong from the Pinggu County Forestry Section. Leaving the county seat and heading east, crossing the Ju River, one of the main tributaries of the Ji Canal, and passing through an increasingly narrow fan-shaped plain, we entered the Yin of Panshan Mountain, a famous mountain in the Yanshan Mountains. Nanshancun Township, known as the "Land of Flowers and Fruits," is located in the gullies of this area. It is this small village of only two hundred or so households that has greened a large number of surrounding mountains and slopes with the most tenacious effort. We approached the village along the winding Stone River. Looking around, we were surrounded by majestic peaks. Small villages, sparsely scattered, were nestled close to the gentle slopes of the valleys and the terraces at the bottom. Terraced fields, like countless long ribbons, bound the large and small mountains. On every slope and in every valley were densely planted walnut, persimmon, pear, apricot, and other fruit trees. Comrade Xiong, who was familiar with and loved this village, said to us, half in boasting and half in regret: "You've come at the wrong time and can't see the good scenery. If you came in the spring, you wouldn't be able to see a single house on the hillside; the entire village and valley would be sealed off by fruit trees full of blossoms." However, we came at a good time too; it snowed lightly the night we arrived in the township. The next day, Nanshancun Township and the surrounding mountains were covered with a thin layer of silvery white, and Nanshancun Township greeted us with its beautiful snow scenery.
    Good Life
    Living in Nanshancun Township is truly a great happiness. The prosperity of diversified economies such as agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry has made this small village far in the depths of the mountains (small only in terms of population, not area) famous throughout the province. Township Head Li Juncai told us that the Xuming Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Cooperative, which includes all the township's farmers, paid 2.17 yuan per workday last year. According to the extrapolation of statistical materials from three production teams (the economic situation of all thirteen teams in the cooperative is the same), including income from household sideline occupations, the average income per person in the cooperative was more than 174 yuan. The production level of the local well-to-do middle peasants before cooperativization has been far surpassed. Such a high income is envied even by farmers in affluent plain areas. What surprised us when we first arrived in the township was that most farmhouses in the township could live in beautiful large tiled houses with blue bricks, blue tiles, and glass windows. People said that because everyone disliked thatching grass on straw houses every year, which was too labor-intensive, they wanted to replace them with tiled houses. The number of tiled houses increased so quickly that the statistics kept by the township clerk quickly became outdated. From 1955 to the winter of 1957, more than 300 tiled houses were added to the township; and many farmers had already prepared the materials to build tiled houses this spring. It turned out that the cooperative sold bricks, tiles, and lime from its own kilns to cooperative members at cost for building houses, so it was no wonder that farmers could build tiled houses so easily. Equally noteworthy was that this township of only 282 households now has 49 mineral radio sets, two battery-operated radios, 50 clocks, and 30 bicycles. As for flashlights, thermos bottles, rubber shoes, umbrellas, etc., almost every household has them. Most families have floral quilts and mattresses, and the women's clothing is also beautiful. All this good life is obtained through the diligent hands of the people, from the development of mountain production.
    From "No-Man's Land" to Greening
    Nanshancun Township's current good situation is not an easy thing to come by. The history of this village, which has suffered many hardships, is full of blood and tears, and also full of tenacious struggle. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, Nanshancun Township became an anti-Japanese base area. The Japanese invaders came to "mop up" and destroyed this deep mountainous area as a "no-man's land," burning the entire township to the ground, leaving only one hall of the Longquan Temple at the foot of Phoenix Mountain. All the residents of the township fled to other places. After Japan surrendered, the people of Nanshancun Township gradually returned to their hometowns, built broken thatched houses on the ruins, reclaimed the barren farmland, and carefully cultivated the barren fruit trees, under the leadership and care of the Party. Production gradually recovered and developed, and the population also increased significantly. This village, which was destroyed by the enemy, stood up again. By 1956, the township's grain output had increased from 160,000 jin in 1950 to more than 480,000 jin. In 1957, despite the severe drought, grain output still increased to more than 560,000 jin, and grain output per mu increased from 185 jin in the previous year to 201 jin. Now, the number of fruit trees in the township has also increased from 50,000 in 1955 to more than 80,000. Due to the widespread implementation of new cultivation techniques in recent years, fruit tree yields have increased unprecedentedly.
    While restoring and developing agriculture and fruit tree production, the farmers of Nanshancun Township also, for the first time, launched a heroic struggle to green the barren mountains and ridges. The total area of the township is about 20,000 mu, except for more than 3,100 mu of cultivated land (mostly hillside terraced fields mixed with fruit trees), the rest is mainly barren mountains. The township has an average of 2.3 mu of cultivated land and 12.4 mu of barren mountains per person. History handed over the arduous task of greening the barren mountains to the people of Nanshancun, who had become masters of the land and embarked on the socialist road. Since 1951, the township has begun to afforest and close off mountains for forestry on a large scale on barren mountains. By 1957, the township had afforested about 7,000 mu. Except for the thousands of mu of barren mountains temporarily designated as pastures, large areas of the remaining barren mountains have been planted with trees.
    Moving Forward Amidst Great Difficulties
    Can so many barren mountains really be completely greened? Dare we start greening the barren mountains? For everyone in Nanshancun Township now, there is no doubt about this. However, in the first few difficult years of afforestation, this was a problem that had not yet been resolved in the minds of the masses. The farmers only knew how to plant a few fruit trees or poplars in front of their homes, but they had never heard of planting trees on barren mountains far away from their homes! Some older people said, "It's hard enough to grow rafters and purlins on those barren mountains, let alone a whip handle!" Some people sighed, "Alas, a thousand years for cypress, ten thousand years for pine, by the time the planted saplings grow into timber, people will have long died!" The township's Party organization carried out arduous propaganda and education work, explaining the policy of "whoever plants it owns it, whoever plants it together owns it together" to the masses, and publicizing the possibilities and benefits of greening the barren mountains. After propaganda and education, most people became active; although another part of the people lacked confidence, they finally participated in the afforestation movement. Later, when they saw the lovely seedlings growing from the seeds they had sown with their own hands, their original worries and doubts were thrown to the winds. No difficulty has stopped the progress of the masses' afforestation cause. In the first two years of afforestation, some people couldn't afford to bring dry food up the mountain, and others divided the limited dry food they brought among everyone. Some girls had no shoes to wear up the mountain, and Aunt Li Shufang, the team leader, gave her daughter-in-law's shoes to her. When the saplings distributed by the government were not enough, the township organized young people to collect seeds in other places. If the seeds didn't survive in the first year, they studied the reasons, improved their techniques, and started over. If the saplings died, they seized the opportunity to replant, and if they couldn't replant all of them at once, they would come back a second or third time. This is how Nanshancun Township tenaciously overcame all difficulties, starting with greening the highest and most dangerous mountains farthest from the village, and gradually expanding its position, greening more than 7,000 mu of barren mountains in a few years.
    A Group of Enthusiasts
    Like any emerging cause, the barren mountain afforestation movement in Nanshancun Township began with a group of enthusiasts and pioneers who ran around, publicized and mobilized, and led the masses to march towards the barren mountains. Such figures were particularly numerous among young people. The township's Party organization relied on these people to mobilize the masses. In the early days of afforestation, young activists contracted tasks by village every year, getting up before dawn and sleeping after midnight, using loudspeakers to carry out propaganda. Zhao Yongzhen, the daughter of a poor peasant, was a tireless afforestation pioneer. Every time it was time for afforestation, she got up earlier than anyone else, urging people to get up early and go to the mountain early, door to door. Once, she went back and forth between two villages to publicize afforestation, and after mobilizing the people in these two villages, she went to a third village to help others mobilize the masses. One day in the summer of 1953, a large contingent was afforesting on the mountain when it suddenly rained heavily. For a time, the morale of the afforestation team was low, and some people sat on the rocks preparing to go down the mountain. At this moment, Zhao Yongzhen and Li Shufang continued to wield their large hoes in the rain. The old and the young women led the entire team of women to challenge the men, pushing everyone to persist in working in the rain for a day, finally completing the task of afforestation during the rainy season. After this afforestation, Zhao Yongzhen fell ill for twenty days; but the next time there was afforestation, she worked even harder.
    The young people of Nanshancun Township have made great contributions to the glorious cause of greening their hometown. They not only publicized well, but also worked well. In recent years, dozens of young people in the township have afforested more than 1,000 mu of youth forests, including Phoenix Mountain on the edge of the village.
    Li Shufang's Will
    We visited Li Shufang, an elderly afforestation enthusiast. She has been rated as an afforestation model for the township several times, and was also selected as an afforestation model for the county in 1956. It was she who mobilized women to go to the mountains with another female cadre in the first year of afforestation. This old woman, with bound feet and over half a century old, carried two dou of oak seeds on her back, just like the men, climbing slopes and crossing mountains to afforest in the high and steep mountains. A woman younger than her was too scared to pass by a cliff, so Li Shufang turned around to help her carry the seeds across the cliff, and then came back to help the woman across. Li Shufang told us about her painful experiences with great emotion. Before liberation, she and her honest husband and several children were forced by hunger to "fly around," and could only open up a little land in the most remote barren mountains to plant. Land reform and cooperativization changed her tragic fate. In recent years, her family's situation has gotten better and better. In 1957, her family's labor work points and income from raising pigs alone was 856.10 yuan, an average of 142.70 yuan per person, not including the income from private plots, private fruit trees, and raising chickens. Half a lifetime of poverty has not worn down the will of this excellent working woman. From her interesting conversation, we can see her strong courage, full spirit, and bright and optimistic character. She is not only an afforestation model, but also a pig-raising expert, and a good housekeeper who is diligent and thrifty. We asked her why she was so firmly convinced from the beginning that trees planted on barren mountains would definitely survive. Listen to her answer: "I planted land in the mountains and forests of Xinglong County for fourteen years, and I've seen a lot of trees! Why can trees grow on the mountains there, but we can't plant trees on our mountains? I came along with the Communist Party, and the Communist Party mobilized us to plant trees, so they will definitely survive!" A few short sentences contain a simple truth derived from life experience: believe in the Party, believe in the power of the working people to transform nature. Regarding planting trees, there used to be a saying, "The predecessors plant trees, and the descendants rest in the shade"; what does Li Shufang think? "The saplings sprout, watching them grow up, it doesn't matter what material they become, whoever uses them is fine. Besides, the mountains are full of trees, how majestic!" Again, a few short sentences reveal such lofty emotions!
    An Eternally Young Village
    Nature has not disappointed the hard work of the people, and the farmers of Nanshancun Township have already partially enjoyed the fruits of afforestation and closing off mountains for forestry. Some of the peach trees planted four years ago blossomed and bore fruit last year. In the past, it was very difficult to burn firewood while guarding the barren mountains, but now, not only does every household have enough firewood to burn, but the firewood burned by the cooperative's kiln can also come from the mountains. The development of forestry has promoted the prosperity of animal husbandry. Now, the number of cattle, sheep, and pigs in this cooperative has increased many times compared to the early days of afforestation. Due to the great increase in livestock manure fertilizer, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of farmland in the entire cooperative last year increased from 20 stacks to 30 stacks, and this year it is planned to increase to 40 stacks, guaranteeing the increase in unit area yield of farmland. Since 1956, the people here have also learned the method of integrating afforestation with agricultural production, intercropping beans, buckwheat, radishes, and other crops near the saplings, and there are benefits in the same year. The role of afforestation and closing off mountains for forestry in soil and water conservation is also becoming increasingly apparent.
    Greening has turned Nanshancun Township into an eternally young village. People put the greatest effort into cultivating trees, and the trees have brought better and better scenes, so people cherish the trees even more. In recent years, the farmers of Nanshancun Township have consciously abided by the system of closing off mountains for forestry and protecting forests from fire. The township organized people who graze cattle and sheep to serve as forest rangers, responsible for patrolling the mountains. In the past, mountain fires occurred every year, but since 1951, there has not been a single mountain fire. Since 1956, attention has been paid to weeding and loosening the soil for young forests to promote their development and growth. In this township, everyone cares for young trees as if they were caring for young livestock. If someone comes down from the distant mountains, the villagers will ask how the young trees are growing there, and how tall the trees planted a few years ago have grown.
    During our visit to Nanshancun Township, we crossed many mountains and climbed many dangerous slopes to see the growing saplings. We saw that various saplings were growing well not only on the relatively flat hillsides, but also beside cliffs and on steep slopes. Particularly endearing were the small pine trees with fresh green needles, which were only one to three feet tall. Each small pine tree stood like a small umbrella on the snow-covered hillside, proudly despising the surrounding decaying grass and leaves, as if it was about to break free from the shackles of the hard frozen soil and stand upright. Looking at these strong small pine trees full of infinite vitality, one couldn't help but think of their owners. Don't these small pine trees symbolize the tenacious and heroic character of the people of Nanshancun Township? Such people have given the order: all mountains must become forests! Then, these barren mountains and ridges must quickly shed their old colors and put on green clothes.

    不绿化高山峻岭誓不休
    ——访问奋斗七年绿化了七千亩荒山的南山村乡
    本报记者　陈泊微
    在最缺乏绿色的冬天，我们访问了一个正在绿化着的村庄——河北省平谷县南山村乡。冬季的自然环境使我们只看到了较少的绿色；然而这个村庄绿化荒山秃岭的丰功伟绩，却使我们足够地看到了英雄人民在变革自然面貌上表现出来的青春活力。
    好景致
    那是年初的一天，我们随同平谷县林业科的熊同志到南山村去。出了县城东行，渡过蓟运河上游主要支流之一的泃河，穿过愈走愈狭的扇形平原，就进入燕山山脉中的名山——盘山之阴了。被称为花果之乡的南山村乡，就在这一带的山沟里。就是这座只有二百多户的小村庄，以最顽强的努力把周围大量的山头和沟坡绿化了。我们沿着曲折的石河套走近了村庄。举目四眺，周围群峰环列，气势雄伟。一座座疏疏落落的小村庄都紧贴在沟谷的缓坡上和沟底的台地上。一道道的梯田，好似无数的长带子，束住了大大小小的山头。在每一处沟坡上，在每一条沟谷里，都密布着核桃、柿子、梨、杏等等果林。熟悉而且热爱着这座村庄的熊同志，半夸耀半惋惜地对我们说：“你们来得不是时候，看不到好景致。要是在春天来，你们在山坡上根本看不见一所房子，整个村庄和山沟都被满树繁花的果林封住了。”不过我们来得也算巧，在到乡那天的夜里；就下起了一场小雪。第二天，南山村乡和它周围的群山都换上一层薄薄的银白色的轻装，南山村乡以它的美丽的雪景接待了我们。
    好生活
    生活在南山村乡，真是很大的幸福。农、林、牧业多种经济的繁荣，使得这座远在深山里的小村庄（说它小，只是就人口说，而不是就面积说），已经在全省出了名。乡长李俊才告诉我们：包括了全乡农户的旭明农林牧业合作社，去年每个劳动日的报酬是二元一角七分。根据三个生产队统计材料的推算（全社十三个队的经济情况都是相同的），加上家庭副业收入在内，全社每人平均收入有一百七十四元多。合作化前当地富裕中农的生产水平已经被远远地抛在后面了。这样高的收入，就是富庶的平原地区的农民也会羡慕的。初到乡的时候使我们惊奇的是：这个乡的大多数农家都能住着青砖青瓦带玻璃窗的漂亮的大瓦房。人们说：因为大家嫌草房年年得苫草，太费工，所以要用瓦房来代替它。瓦房增加得这样快，以致乡文书费心统计的瓦房数字很快又变成陈旧的了。从1955年到1957年冬，全乡添了三百多间瓦房；已经准备好材料要在今春盖瓦房的农户还有很多。原来合作社把自营的窑烧出的砖、瓦、石灰按成本卖给社员盖房子使用，不怪农民盖起瓦房来为什么那么容易了。同样引人注目的是：这个只有二百八十二户的乡，现在有四十九个矿石收音机，有两个使用电池的收音机，有五十个座钟，有三十辆脚踏车。至于手电筒、暖水瓶、胶鞋、雨伞等等，几乎家家齐全。一般人家都有花被花褥，妇女们的穿戴也漂亮。这一切好生活，都是靠着人们的勤劳的双手，从发展山区生产中获得的。
    从“无人区”到绿化
    南山村乡得有今日这般好光景，可不是件轻易的事。在这个饱经忧患的村庄的历史上，充满着血和泪，也充满着韧性的斗争。抗日战争初期，南山村乡成了抗日根据地。日本侵略者前来扫荡，把这个深山区毁为“无人区”，全乡被烧得只剩下凤凰山脚下的龙泉寺的一间大殿。全乡居民全部逃散到外地。日本投降后，南山村乡人民陆续返回家乡，在废墟上搭起破草房，把荒芜的粮田垦复起来，把荒得不结果的果树精心培育起来，在党的领导和关怀下，生产逐渐恢复和发展起来，人口也增加了不少。这个被敌人毁灭的村庄又站立起来了。到1956年，全乡粮食产量已由1950年的十六万斤增加到四十八万多斤。1957年，在大旱的情况下，粮食产量仍然增加到五十六万多斤，每亩粮食产量由前年的一百八十五斤提高到二百零一斤。现在，全乡果树也由1955年的五万棵增加到八万多棵。由于几年来普遍推行了新的栽培技术，果树产量空前提高。
    在恢复和发展农业、果树生产的同时，南山村乡农民又破天荒第一次展开了绿化童山秃岭的英勇斗争。这个乡的总面积约有两万多亩，除了三千一百多亩耕地（大部分还是混有果树的山坡梯田），其余主要是荒山。全乡平均每人有二点三亩耕地，另有十二点四亩荒山。历史把绿化荒山的艰巨任务交给做了土地的主人、并且走上了社会主义道路的南山村人民。从1951年起，这个乡就开始在荒山上大面积造林和封山育林。到1957年，全乡共造林约七千余亩。除了暂时划做牧场的几千亩荒山以外，其余大片荒山都已种上或者栽上了树。
    在重重困难中前进
    这么多的荒山究竟能不能全部绿化？敢不敢动手绿化荒山？这在现在的南山村乡的每个人来说，都已经毫无疑问了。可是，在开始造林的几个困难的年头，这却是群众思想上还没有解决的问题。农民们只知道在家门口栽上几棵果树或者杨柳树，可从来也没听说还要用人工在离家老远的荒山上栽种上树！一些上年纪的人说：“那荒山不用说长柁长檩，连长根鞭杆也难呵！”有的人长叹着说：“唉，千年柏万年松，等种上的树苗长成材，人早死了！”乡的党组织进行了艰巨的宣传教育工作，向群众解释“谁种谁有、伙种伙有”的政策，宣传绿化荒山的可能和好处。经过宣传教育，大多数人积极了起来；另外一部分人虽然信心不足，但也终于参加了造林运动。到后来，当他们看见自己亲手播下的种子长出可爱的幼苗的时候，原先的顾虑和怀疑，也就被抛到九霄云外了。什么困难都没有阻止住群众造林事业的前进。造林的头一两年，一部分人上山带不起干粮，另一些人就把带来的有限的干粮匀开大家吃。有的姑娘上山没鞋穿，带队的李淑芳老大娘就把自己儿媳妇的鞋给她穿。政府发下的树种不够用，乡里就组织年青人分头到外地采树种。头一年树种不活，就研究原因，改进技术，重新做起。树苗死了，就抓紧时机补植，一次补不全，再来第二次、第三次。南山村乡就是这样顽强地战胜了一切困难，首先从绿化离村最远的又高又险的大山头做起，逐步扩大阵地，几年的工夫就把七千多亩荒山绿化了。
    一批热心家
    和任何一项新兴的事业一样，南山村乡的荒山造林运动一开始，就有一批热心家和急先锋出来为这项艰巨的事业奔走呼号，宣传鼓动，带动广大群众向荒山进军。这样的人物在青年当中特别多。乡的党组织就是依靠这些人去发动广大群众。在造林初期，青年积极分子们每年每次都按村庄包干，起五更睡半夜，用广播筒进行宣传。赵永珍，一个贫农的女儿，就是一个不知疲倦的造林急先锋。每次造林的日子，她比谁起得都早，挨家逐户催人们早起早上山。有一次，她一个人来往奔走在两个村庄宣传造林，等把这两个村庄的人发动起来以后，又去第三个村庄帮助别人发动群众。1953年夏季的一天，大队人马正在山上造林，忽然降了大雨，一时造林队伍情绪涣散了，有些人坐在石头上准备下山去。就在这个时候，赵永珍和李淑芳在大雨中照样抡起大镐，刨个不停。她们一老一少带领全队妇女向男人们挑战，推动大家在雨中坚持干了一天，终于完成了雨季造林任务。这次造林以后，赵永珍病倒了二十天；但是下一次造林的时候，她干得更起劲了。
    南山村乡的青年们在绿化家乡的光荣事业上创造了巨大的功绩。他们不但宣传得好，而且干活干得好。几年来，全乡几十个青年共造了一千多亩青年林，包括村边的一座凤凰山。
    李淑芳的意志
    我们访问了年老的造林热心家李淑芳。她数次被评为乡的造林模范，1956年又被选为县的造林模范。就是她，在造林的第一年，同另一个妇女干部发动妇女上山。这位缠足的、年过半百的老大娘，和男子一样背着二斗橡树种，爬坡越岭，到又高又陡的远山去造林。有个比她年轻的妇女在悬崖旁边吓得过不去了，李淑芳就回过头来帮她把树种背过悬崖，然后再回来把那个妇女搀过去。李淑芳很感慨地向我们述说了自己的痛苦经历。她和她的忠厚的丈夫和几个孩子，在解放前被饥饿逼得“到处飞”，只能到最偏僻的荒山里开一点地种。土地改革和合作化才改变了她的悲惨的命运。这些年来，她家的光景越过越好。1957年她家光劳动工分和自家养猪的收入就有八百五十六元一角，平均每人一百四十二元七角，这还不包括自留地和自留果树和养鸡的收入。多半辈子的穷困没有磨损这位优秀的劳动妇女的意志。从她的有趣的言谈中，可以看出她的坚强勇敢、精神饱满、明朗乐观的性格。她是造林模范，又是养猪能手，也是勤俭持家的好当家人。我们问她为什么一开始就那样坚决地相信荒山上种树一定能种活？听听她的回答吧：“我在兴隆县的山林里种过十四年地，看见的树木多着哩！为什么那里的山能长树，而我们的山不能种上树？我是跟共产党走过来的，共产党发动种树，就准能种活！”短短的几句话，包含着从生活经验中得来的朴素的真理：相信党，相信劳动人民改造自然的力量。关于种树，从前就有“前人种树，后人歇荫”的说法；李淑芳怎么想呢？“树种出苗啦，看着它长成，做什么材料都行，谁使用都好。再说，山上长满了树，那多么威武呀！”又是短短的几句话，流露出多么崇高的感情呵！
    永远年轻的村庄
    大自然没有辜负人们的辛勤劳动，南山村乡的农民已经部分地享受到造林和封山育林的果实了。四年前种的桃树，去年就有一部分开花结果。从前守着荒山烧柴很困难，现在不但家家不缺柴烧，社里的窑烧的柴也能由山上出。林业的发展，促进了畜牧业的兴旺。现在这个社的牛、羊、猪比造林初期增加了好多倍。由于牲畜粪肥大大增加，去年全社农田的每亩施肥量由二十垛增加到三十垛，今年计划增加到四十垛，增加农田单位面积产量有了保证。从1956年起，这里的人们还学到了把造林和农业生产结合起来的农林混作办法，在树苗的附近间种豆子、荞麦、萝卜等作物，当年就有收益。造林和封山育林对于水土保持的作用，也越来越大地显示出来了。
    绿化使得南山村乡变成了一座永远年轻的村庄。人们用最大的精力培育了树木，树木带来了越来越好的光景，因此人们也就更加爱护树木。几年来，南山村乡的农民们都自觉地遵守着封山育林和护林防火的制度。乡里把放牛放羊的人都组织起来，使他们担任护林员，负责巡山。从前山火年年发生，从1951年到现在，没有发生一次山火。从1956年开始，注意给幼林锄草、松土，以促进幼林的发育成长。在这个乡里，真是人人都像关怀幼畜那样关怀着幼树。如果有人从远山上下来，村里的人就来询问那里的幼树生长得怎样，询问几年前种的树长有多高了。
    在访问南山村乡的日子里，我们翻过好多山头，爬过好多险坡，去看正在成长着的幼树。我们看到，各种各样的幼树，不仅在较平坦的山坡上，而且在悬崖旁和陡坡上，都生长得很好。特别惹人爱的是那些鲜绿的小松树，它们还只有一尺到三尺高。每一棵小松树都像一柄小伞似地站在雪后的山坡上，骄傲地鄙视着周围的衰草败叶，好像就要挣破坚硬的冻土的束缚似地向上挺拔着。看着这些充满无限生机的坚强的小松树，使人不禁想起了它们的主人。这些小松树不正象征着南山村乡人民所具有的那种顽强的英雄性格吗？这样的人民下了命令：都要变成森林山！那么，这些童山秃岭就一定得很快地褪去旧色，换上绿装。
