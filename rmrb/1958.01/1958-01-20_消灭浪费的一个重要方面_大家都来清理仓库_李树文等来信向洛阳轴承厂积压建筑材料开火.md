An Important Aspect of Eliminating Waste
Everyone Clean Up the Warehouses
Li Shuwen and Others Write to Criticize the Luoyang Bearing Factory's Stockpiled Construction Materials

    This newspaper reports that Li Shuwen and Wang Guilan from the Luoyang Jianxi Branch of the Construction Bank of China wrote to say that the Luoyang Bearing Factory is stockpiling a large amount of construction materials, some of which have deteriorated. According to incomplete calculations, the stockpiled steel, electrical wires and cables, refractory materials, magnesite, and other four kinds of materials are worth about 920,000 yuan. Some of the stockpiled steel has rusted, and about 40% of the stockpiled 32 tons of magnesite has hardened and deteriorated.
    The letter stated that the reasons for the large amount of stockpiled construction materials are: (1) Procurement was done too early, too much, and repeatedly. For example, 3,648 electric furnace maintenance and insulation anvils were purchased, but only 800 were actually used. (2) Party B did not strictly implement the contract, resulting in the stockpiling of more than 86 tons of asbestos diatomaceous earth prepared by Party A. (3) Some staff members seriously neglected their duties. In mid-November 1955, when the factory sent people to Zhangjiakou to purchase magnesite, they noted in the contract due to the absence of a quality certificate that "the buyer will take samples for testing first, and if the quality does not meet the requirements, the seller will be notified to cancel the contract within ten days." However, the procurement personnel lost the test samples they took to Beijing, and their whereabouts are still unknown. Later, the personnel who went to expedite the shipment also did not fulfill their responsibilities, and as a result, they purchased the already deteriorated magnesite. After testing in the factory, it was found that up to 25% of it had hardened. (4) The supply work was chaotic. In June 1956, the Automotive Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building allocated 29.25 tons of seamless steel pipes and other materials to the Luoyang Bearing Factory, worth 31,917 yuan. After being shipped to a neighboring factory—the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant—the factory failed to pick them up for more than a year. It wasn't until the supply department of the Tractor Factory raised this issue in July 1957 that they discovered this "family property." (5) Lack of initiative in handling stockpiled materials.
    The materials revealed in the letters from comrades Li and Wang show that the waste of a large amount of stockpiled materials is serious. Therefore, opposing stockpiling, opening up warehouses, and clearing out useful materials is an important aspect of the current anti-waste struggle.

    (Editor's note: After receiving the letter from Comrade Li Shuwen and others, we contacted the Luoyang Bearing Factory. The factory admitted that they had stockpiled materials and that some materials had deteriorated, but they believed that the figures in the letter were inaccurate. According to the materials inventoried by them in December of last year, the inventory of metal materials, electrical wires, cement, magnesite, and refractory materials was worth more than 889,000 yuan at that time. Except for the materials needed for production and capital construction in 1958 and the part that has now been allocated, the stockpiled materials are worth a total of more than 441,000 yuan.)

### 消灭浪费的一个重要方面  大家都来清理仓库  李树文等来信向洛阳轴承厂积压建筑材料开火

    消灭浪费的一个重要方面
    大家都来清理仓库
    李树文等来信向洛阳轴承厂积压建筑材料开火
    本报讯　中国建设银行洛阳涧西分行李树文、王桂兰来信说：洛阳轴承厂积压着大量建筑材料，有些已经变质。仅积压的钢材、电线电缆、耐火材料、菱苦土等四种材料，据不完全计算，约值九十二万元。有些积压的钢材已经生锈；积压的三十二吨菱苦土，硬化变质的已有40％左右。
    来信说：造成大量建筑材料积压的原因是：（一）采购得过早、过多和重复。如购买电炉维修保温砧三千六百四十八块，实际只用上八百块。（二）乙方没有严格执行合同，使甲方备的石棉硅藻土积压八十六吨多。（三）部分工作人员严重失职。1955年11月中旬，这个厂派人到张家口采购菱苦土时，因无质量证明，曾在合同上注明：买方先取样品化验，如果质量不合要求，在十天内通知售方将合同注销。但当时采购人员将化验样品带到北京后遗失，至今下落不明；后来去催运的人员也没有很好地尽到责任，结果将已经变质的菱苦土也购回来了；运进厂后经过化验，硬化的即达25％左右。（四）供应工作混乱。1956年6月，第一机械工业部汽车工业管理局拨给洛阳轴承厂二十九点二五吨无缝钢管等材料，价值三万一千九百一十七元；经发运到邻厂——第一拖拉机制造厂以后，这个厂一年多没有去起运，直到1957年7月间拖拉机厂供应部门提出这一问题，他们才发现有这份“家业”。（五）处理积压材料不积极。
    从李、王两同志来信揭发的材料可以看出，大量积压物资的浪费现象是严重的。因此，反对积压，打开仓库，把有用的物资清理出来，是当前反浪费斗争的一个重要方面。
    （编者按：我们收到李树文等同志的信后，曾与洛阳轴承厂联系。这个厂承认他们有积压材料和部分材料变质的情况，但认为来信中的数字有出入。据他们在去年12月间盘点的材料，当时库存金属材料、电线、水泥、菱苦土、耐火材料，共值八十八万九千多元；除1958年生产、基本建设需用材料和现在已调拨的部分，积压材料共值四十四万一千多元。）
