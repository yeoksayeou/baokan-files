Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 7th: Four relatives of American prisoners Downey, Fecteau, and Redmond, who were sentenced and imprisoned by the Chinese government for engaging in espionage activities in China, arrived in Guangzhou yesterday from Hong Kong. They will travel to Beijing and Shanghai respectively to visit these American prisoners in custody.

The mother of American prisoner Downey, Mary Downey, and his brother William Downey, the mother of American prisoner Fecteau, Jessie Fecteau, and the mother of American prisoner Redmond, Ruth Redmond, entered the country yesterday morning from Shenzhen.

After entering the country, the relatives of the American prisoners received assistance from personnel of the Chinese Red Cross.

It should be pointed out that, out of humanitarian considerations, the Chinese government expressed its agreement as early as January 1955 to allow the relatives of American prisoners to come to China to visit their relatives, but the U.S. government had been prohibiting them from coming. It was not until December 6, 1957, under pressure from American public opinion, that the U.S. State Department announced that it would allow the immediate family members of American prisoners to visit their relatives in China.

American spy John Thomas Downey was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China on November 23, 1954, for actively collecting, training, and dispatching special agents to parachute into China to carry out sabotage activities, and for personally infiltrating China by plane to carry out criminal activities.

American spy Richard George Fecteau, who assisted Downey in infiltrating China by plane to engage in espionage activities, was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment by the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China on November 23, 1954.

American spy Redmond was dispatched by the U.S. government's spy agency to lurk in China to organize a spy organization, to steal state secrets, and to privately store arms. He was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Military Control Commission Military Law Department of Shanghai Municipality of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on September 12, 1954.

    美国犯人的亲属四人到达广州
    新华社广州7日电　由于在中国进行间谍活动而被中国政府判刑监禁的美国犯人唐奈、费克图和雷德蒙的亲属昨天从香港到达广州。他们将分别前往北京和上海探望这些在押的美国犯人。
    美犯唐奈的母亲玛丽·唐奈和他的弟弟威廉·唐奈，美犯费克图的母亲杰茜·费克图，和美犯雷德蒙的母亲露思·雷德蒙等四人是昨天上午由深圳入境的。
    美犯亲属入境后，得到了中国红十字会人员的协助。
    应该指出，中国政府出于人道考虑，早在1955年1月就表示同意让美犯的亲属前来中国探亲，但是美国政府一直禁止他们前来。直到1957年12月6日美国国务院在美国舆论的压力下才宣布允许美犯的直系亲属来中国探亲。
    美国间谍约翰·托马斯·唐奈因为积极搜罗、训练和派遣特务分子乘用飞机空投中国境内进行破坏活动，并且亲自乘飞机潜入中国实施罪恶活动，于1954年11月23日被中华人民共和国最高人民法院军事审判庭判处无期徒刑。
    美国间谍理查德·乔治·费克图协助唐奈乘飞机侵入中国境内，进行间谍特务活动，于1954年11月23日被中华人民共和国最高人民法院军事审判庭判处徒刑二十年。
    美国间谍雷德蒙受美国政府间谍机关派遣，潜伏在中国境内组织间谍组织，刺探我国家机密，私藏军火，于1954年9月12日被中国人民解放军上海市军事管制委员会军法处判处无期徒刑。
