Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tehran on January 22nd, Iranian Foreign Minister Ardalan said: Unless Iran is subjected to a so-called "serious threat," "we will never agree to make our country's territory a base against the Soviet Union." He said, "We stand by this statement."

Ardalan made these remarks when an Agence France-Presse reporter asked him to comment on a TASS statement exposing the United States' attempt to establish missile bases in the Middle East.

Ardalan's remarks were made on the eve of US Secretary of State Dulles' arrival in Tehran. According to the announced plan, Dulles will first visit the Iranian capital on the 24th before going to Ankara to attend the Baghdad Pact Council meeting.

    伊朗外交大臣阿达兰说
    伊朗不愿成为反苏基地
    新华社23日讯　据法新社德黑兰22日消息，伊朗外交大臣阿达兰说：除非伊朗受到所谓“严重威胁”，“我们永远不同意使我国领土成为反对苏联的基地”。他说：“我们坚持这个声明”。
    阿达兰是在法新社记者请他就塔斯社揭露美国企图在中近东建立导弹基地的声明发表意见时说这番话的。
    阿达兰的这项谈话发表在美国国务卿杜勒斯到德黑兰的前夕。按照已经宣布的计划，杜勒斯在到安卡拉参加巴格达条约理事会会议以前，将在24日先到伊朗首都活动。
