Pride Makes One Lag Behind; Modesty Helps One Progress
Jiangpu County, Jiangsu: Third-Category Cooperatives Resolutely Rectify and Leap Forward; First-Category Cooperatives Are Complacent and Conservative, Making Slow Progress

(Report from our newspaper) Nanjing Xinhua Daily used several examples of third-category cooperatives rising and first-category cooperatives declining to vividly illustrate the necessity of conducting thorough rectification campaigns in rural areas. After the rectification campaign, six of the original eight third-category cooperatives in Jiangpu County, Jiangsu Province, have now respectively improved to the production level of first or second-category cooperatives; however, at the same time, a few original first-category cooperatives have fallen behind in the production movement. For example, the Tongxin and Tuanjie cooperatives in Baima Township have the same production conditions and are adjacent to each other. The Tongxin cooperative, a third-category cooperative, had completed 120% of its water conservancy plan by December 25 last year (an average of one hundred cubic meters of earthwork per person), while the Tuanjie cooperative, originally a first-category cooperative, had only completed 12.5% of its task by January 5 this year (an average of twenty-one cubic meters of earthwork per person).

How did this situation occur?

Third-Category Cooperatives Rectified Vigorously
First-Category Cooperatives Rectified Hastily

The third-category cooperatives that changed their backward appearance in the high tide of production mainly conducted a relatively thorough rectification campaign in conjunction with production. After cadres engaged in extensive airing of views, big debates, and big character posters, they implemented resolute rectification. For example, the Tongxin cooperative in Baima Township conducted a major debate centered on the grain issue, which lasted for three months. In addition to resolving to invite criticism, the cooperative cadres proactively listened to the criticisms of the members. Issues raised by the members, such as failure to cherish public property, the vice-chairman Chen Taichao not participating in production for a whole year, and unclear accounts, were immediately corrected during the airing of views. At the same time, they mobilized the members to engage in extensive debate to clarify the major issues of right and wrong on the grain issue. Through the rectification campaign, the work style of most third-category cooperative cadres has been significantly improved. In the past, the cadres of the Xige cooperative in Yongning Township rarely participated in production. Now, the five main cadres have worked at least thirty workdays. Seeing that the cadres humbly examined their shortcomings and quickly corrected them, the members also took the initiative to make self-criticisms. The cadres and the masses were united in thought, and the enthusiasm for production became increasingly strong.

However, in a few first-category cooperatives, mass airing of views and big debates were not carried out. Some cooperatives organized airing of views, but did not organize debates. The cadres were even less determined to carry out rectification. For example, most team cadres and members of the Lanhua cooperative in Lanhua Township did not clearly understand the grain "making up for lean years with good harvests" policy, and this was not resolved through debate. The Longhua cooperative in Baima Township conducted airing of views for half a month, but did not debate the erroneous opinions of the members, so the members lacked enthusiasm. Although the members of the Tuanjie cooperative raised the correct opinion that "cadres participate too little in production and subsidize too many work points," only two of the thirteen main cadres of the cooperative and team personally participated in production, so they could not motivate the enthusiasm of the members.

From the perspective of the class line, the production leap forward of the third-category cooperatives mainly relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants to do a good job of rectification and production. After the rectification campaign, these leaping third-category cooperatives reorganized their organizations, and the leading backbone was dominated by poor and lower-middle peasants. After reorganization, six of the seven leading backbone members of the Tongxin cooperative were poor and lower-middle peasants. Four of the five main cadres of the Xige cooperative in Yongning Township were poor peasants. During the rectification campaign, they relied on the poor peasants, refuted the erroneous understandings of the wealthy middle peasants such as "cooperation is not as good as individual farming" and "production is not good because the cooperative is not good." At the same time, they also cultivated a large number of backbone members of poor and lower-middle peasant composition. For example, when the production movement began, Huang Deming, a wealthy middle peasant of the Xige cooperative, asked, "Can we eat more if we increase grain production?" Wang Shirong, a wealthy middle peasant, put forward the argument that "Running cooperatives depends on poor peasants, and production depends on wealthy middle peasants." In the debate, the poor peasant members said: "Increasing production is for the country and for us. Only when the country is prosperous can our lives be prosperous." While affirming that wealthy middle peasants have certain production experience, they cited that wealthy middle peasants are not as good as poor peasants in four fundamental issues: 1. The attitude towards running cooperatives is not as firm as that of the poor peasants. Last spring, four wealthy middle peasant households in the cooperative requested to withdraw from the cooperative, and nine wealthy middle peasant households wavered, but no poor peasant household requested to withdraw from the cooperative or wavered; 2. They are conservative in production. When formulating production plans, the wealthy middle peasants only requested to complete 24,000 cubic meters of earthwork in winter and spring, while the poor peasants requested to complete 40,000 cubic meters of earthwork; 3. They follow the wealthy peasants economically. Last spring, 34 wealthy middle peasant households engaged in commercial speculation; 4. Ideologically, they are not satisfied with the government's grain policy. Through debate, the leading advantage of the poor peasants was established. At the same time, the cooperative also relied on party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and poor peasants to take the lead in actively producing, driving the general upper-middle peasants, so that the average labor efficiency of the entire cooperative in the past winter reached 100 cubic meters of earthwork per person, which is more than doubled compared to the winter of 1956.

The situation in a few first-category cooperatives was exactly the opposite. Although the leadership composition of these cooperatives was dominated by poor peasants, they did not implement the class line in production activities. When deploying the winter production movement, most of the poor peasants in the Tuanjie cooperative in Baima Township were enthusiastic and determined to work hard and practically; however, the wealthy middle peasants were hesitant and not very motivated. After the poor peasants worked hard, five wealthy middle peasant households in the first team still worked for two days and rested for one day. The poor peasant members requested to carry out debates with the wealthy middle peasants and to set tasks for individuals, but the cooperative and team cadres did not actively support them and accommodated the backward thinking of the wealthy middle peasants.

Criticize Conservative Thinking
Clarify the Direction of the Leap Forward

The leap of third-category cooperatives to first and second-category cooperatives is closely related to the in-depth debate on the Forty Articles, clarifying the direction of the leap forward, constantly criticizing conservative thinking, and adopting methods of grasping both ends to bring along the middle and carrying out competitions. These cooperatives generally selected issues that the masses were most interested in and directly related to winter production, and organized members to debate "Can we complete 800 jin ahead of schedule?" and "How many years can water conservancy problems be solved?" Through debate, they established the idea of ​​a great leap forward, and formulated leap forward indicators and measures. In the production movement, they also constantly criticized conservative thinking. For example, the members of the Xige cooperative did not believe that the Fuxing cooperative could do 8 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day, so the cooperative organized three members of the Communist Youth League to experiment for a day. Sure enough, each person carried 16 cubic meters of earthwork (100 steps distance). The cooperative committee immediately used a bulletin to publicize this to the teams and launched a competition between people and teams. At the same time, they sent the director of the cooperative, Zhang Huaiguang, to lead the high-yield team, and the secretary of the party branch, Zhang Guangnian, to the most backward ninth team, to implement a series of measures such as improving tools and assigning tasks to households, so that the production of the backward team quickly caught up. Now, the average daily work efficiency of the labor force in the entire cooperative has reached 6 cubic meters of earthwork.

However, because a few first-category cooperatives did not seriously study and debate the agricultural development program, the conservative and complacent thinking of the cadres and the masses was not criticized. When the township helped them plan the 800 jin target for this year, the Lanhua cooperative in Lanhua Township did not believe that production would make a great leap forward this year and still produced according to the old methods. Therefore, when the third-category cooperatives put 100% of their labor force into winter production, this cooperative still had too much labor force engaged in sideline occupations. The Longhua cooperative in Baima Township did not implement the county party committee's instruction of "assigning tasks to individuals" from the beginning of the movement, and did not carry out competitions, so production lagged behind the leaping Tongxin cooperative.

It is necessary to promote the backward to catch up with the advanced
It is also necessary to make the advanced even more advanced

In terms of leadership thinking, attaching importance to the backward catching up with the advanced and neglecting the advanced becoming even more advanced is the main reason for the production leap forward of the third-category cooperatives and the slow production of the first-category cooperatives. At the beginning of the movement, the party committees of various townships in Jiangpu County paid special attention to the leadership of backward cooperatives. Li Wenfu, secretary of the Baima Township Party Committee, personally engaged in large-scale airing of views and big debates in the Tongxin cooperative, and Zheng Jiayin, the first secretary of the Longshan Township Party Committee, continuously went to the Sunlong cooperative, so that the backward appearance of these cooperatives quickly changed, but they relaxed the leadership of the first-category cooperatives, thinking that the first-category cooperatives were always first-category cooperatives and would do a good job in production. The Baima Township Committee of the Communist Party of China sent three standing committee members to lead the third-category cooperatives, but only took a cursory look at the first-category cooperatives.

The Jiangpu County Committee of the Communist Party of China has promptly discovered this problem and instructed all localities to not only continue to consolidate the leaping third-category cooperatives, but also to strengthen the leadership of the original first-category cooperatives whose production is lagging behind in the movement so that they can quickly catch up. The county party committee has sent cadres to the Tuanjie cooperative to strengthen leadership, so that the labor attendance rate has increased from 60% to 100%, and the work efficiency has also doubled. The Lanhua Township Committee of the Communist Party of China has also sent Gao Dewang, secretary of the general branch, and Dong Yangzhao, a standing committee member, to the Lanhua cooperative to lead and carry out the great production movement.

    骄傲使人落后　虚心使人进步
    江苏江浦县：三类社坚决整改飞跃前进  一类社自满保守进展缓慢
    本报讯　南京新华日报用几个三类社上升和一类社下降的例子，生动地说明在农村中进行深入的整风运动的必要性。经过整风江苏省江浦县原来的八个三类社，现已有六个社分别提高到一类或二类社的生产水平；但同时却有少数原来的一类社在生产运动中落后了。如白马乡的同心和团结两社，生产条件相同，地区毗邻，三类社的同心社，到去年12月25日已经完成水利计划120％（每人平均一百方土），而原来一类社的团结社，到今年1月5日只完成任务的12.5％（每人平均二十一方土）。
    这个情况是怎样发生的呢？
    三类社整改有力
    一类社整改草率
    在生产高潮中改变了落后面貌的三类社，主要是结合生产，进行了比较深入的整风运动，干部在大放大鸣大辩论之后，实行了坚决的整改。如白马乡同心社，以粮食问题为中心的大辩论，先后进行了三个月。社干部在鸣放中除决心引火烧身之外，还用送上门的办法，主动听取社员批评。对社员提出的不爱护公共财物、副社长陈太朝去年一年没有生产、账目不清等问题，在鸣放中立即进行了改正。同时，还发动社员大争大辩，辩清了粮食问题上的大是大非。通过整风运动，大部分三类社干部的作风有了显著改进。永宁乡西葛社干部过去很少参加生产，现在五个主要干部最少的已做了三十个劳动日。社员看到干部虚心检查缺点并迅速改正，也主动作了自我批评，干群思想一致，生产劲头越来越猛。
    而在少数一类社中，群众性的大放大鸣没有开展起来，有些社组织了鸣放，但没有组织辩论。干部更没有痛下决心进行整改。如兰花乡兰花社大部分队干部和社员对粮食“以丰补歉”政策认识不清，而没有通过争辩加以解决。白马乡龙华社搞了半个月大鸣大放，对社员中的错误意见，没有辩论，因此社员干劲不足。团结社社员虽然提出了“干部参加生产太少，补贴工分过多”的正确意见，但全社十三个社、队主要干部，还只有两个干部亲身参加生产，因此也不能鼓动社员的干劲。
    从阶级路线上看，三类社生产跃进，主要是依靠了贫农与下中农，搞好整风和生产。这些跃进的三类社经过整风运动，整顿了组织，领导骨干中贫农与下中农占了优势。同心社经过整顿后，七个领导骨干中有六个是贫农和下中农。永宁乡西葛社五个主要干部中有四个是贫农。在整风运动中，他们依靠了贫农，驳斥了富裕中农的“合作化不如单干”、“生产搞不好是社不好”等错误认识，同时还培养了大批贫农和下中农成份的骨干。如西葛社富裕中农黄德明在生产运动开始时，提出“增产粮食能不能给我们多吃”？富裕中农王世荣提出“办社靠贫农，生产靠富裕中农”的论调。在辩论中，贫农社员说：“增产为国家也为我们，国家富强了，我们生活才能富裕。”他们在肯定富裕中农有一定生产经验的同时，举出了富裕中农在四个根本问题上不如贫农：一、办社态度没有贫农坚决。去年春天全社有四户富裕中农要求退社，有九户富裕中农动摇，但是没有一户贫农要求退社或动摇的；二、生产上保守。在订生产规划时，富裕中农只要求冬春完成二万四千方土任务，而贫农要求完成四万方土任务；三、经济上跟富农走。去年春上有三十四户富裕中农做商业投机；四、思想上对政府粮食政策不满意。通过辩论确立了贫农领导优势。同时，社里还依靠党员、团员和贫农带头积极生产，带动一般上中农，使去冬全社平均每人完成一百方土，比1956年冬季工效增加二倍以上。
    而少数一类社的情况恰恰相反，这些社的领导成份虽然贫农占优势，但在生产活动中却没有贯彻阶级路线。白马乡团结社在布置开展冬季大生产运动时，大多数贫农情绪振奋，决心要苦干、实干；而富裕中农却摇摇摆摆，干劲不大，第一队在贫农下劲干后，仍然有五户富裕中农干两天，休息一天。贫农社员要求和富裕中农开展辩论，要求将任务定到个人，可是社队干部没有积极支持，迁就了富裕中农的落后思想。
    批判保守思想
    明确跃进方向
    三类社跃升到一、二类社，与深入地辩论了四十条纲要，明确跃进方向，不断地批判了保守思想，采取抓两头带中间和开展竞赛的办法，有密切的关系。这些社一般选择了群众最感兴趣与冬季生产直接有关的问题，组织社员辩论了“能不能提前完成八百斤”、“几年内可以解决水利问题”等，通过辩论，确立了大跃进思想，制订了跃进指标与措施。在生产运动中，也不断地批判了保守思想，如西葛社社员不相信复兴社每人每天做八方土，社里即组织了三个共青团员试验了一天，果然每人挑了十六方土（一百步距离）。社委会立即用喜报形式向各队作了宣传，开展了人与人、队与队之间的竞赛。同时，又派社长张怀光领导丰产队，党支部书记张光年到最落后的第九队，贯彻了改良工具、任务包到户等一系列措施，使落后队的生产迅速赶了上来，现在全社出勤劳力每天平均工效已达六方土。
    而少数一类社由于没有认真学习和辩论农业发展纲要，干部群众的保守自满思想没有受到批判。兰花乡兰花社在乡里帮助他们规划今年指标八百斤时，他们不相信今年生产会大跃进，还是按老一套办法生产，因此，当三类社百分之百劳力投入冬季生产时，这个社还有过多的劳力在搞副业。白马乡龙华社在运动开始时，一直没有贯彻县委提出的“任务包到人”的指示，也不开展竞赛，生产上便比跃进的同心社落后了。
    要促使落后赶上先进
    也要使先进更加先进
    在领导思想上，重视落后赶上先进，忽视先进更加先进这个运动发展规律，也是造成三类社生产跃进，一类社生产缓慢的主要原因。在运动开始时，江浦县各乡党委都特别重视了对落后社领导。白马乡党委书记李文富亲自在同心社搞大鸣大放，龙山乡党委第一书记郑加银连续不断到孙垅社，使这些社落后面貌迅速转变，但却放松了对一类社的领导，认为一类社总是一类社，生产会搞得好。中共白马乡委派了三个常委领导三类社，而对一类社只是走马看花溜一趟。
    中共江浦县委已经及时发现了这个问题，指示各地除继续巩固跃进的三类社外，还要加强对运动中生产落后的原来一类社的领导，使他们迅速地赶上去。县委已派出干部到团结社加强了领导，使劳动出勤率从60％增加到100％，工效也提高一倍。中共兰花乡委也派出总支书记高德旺和常委董阳照两人，到兰花社领导，开展大生产运动。
