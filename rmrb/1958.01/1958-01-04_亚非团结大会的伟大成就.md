The 1.7 billion people of Asia and Africa are looking towards Cairo with boundless excitement, celebrating the victorious conclusion of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. There, the envoys of the Asian and African peoples, gathered for seven days, unanimously adopted a series of important resolutions to strengthen Asian-African solidarity, oppose imperialism and colonialism, oppose racial discrimination, and oppose nuclear weapons and the arms race. These resolutions powerfully express the common demands of the Asian and African peoples for national independence, freedom and equality, and reflect the universal aspirations of all peace-loving and freedom-loving people around the world. It will have a significant impact not only on the people of Asia and Africa, but also worldwide. Our people wholeheartedly endorse and fully support the resolutions of the conference, and we extend our highest respect to the Egyptian government and people, the hosts of the conference, and to the representatives of the Asian and African countries participating in the conference.

The Asian-African Solidarity Conference marks a new stage in the great unity of the Asian and African peoples. Nearly fifty Asian and African countries and regions participated in the conference, including representatives from many African colonial and dependent countries who were attending an international conference for the first time. In terms of the scale of the conference and the breadth of representation, this was the largest gathering of its kind in Asian-African history. Although these representatives came from independent nations, socialist countries, and countries that have not yet achieved independence, they share a common goal in the common struggle against colonialism and for the defense of peace. This spirit of unity pervades the speeches of the various representatives and the resolutions of the conference. As the "Appeal to the People of the World" adopted by the conference stated, "The Asian and African peoples have reached a higher level of unity in the task of supporting peace, and have reached the point of having a common program of action."

The Asian-African Solidarity Conference was a great demonstration of the Asian and African peoples against colonialism and imperialism. Representatives of the Asian and African countries powerfully exposed the evils of the colonial system at the conference, and angrily condemned the imperialist aggression in the Asian and African regions. The Asian and African peoples clearly see that colonialism still seriously threatens the national independence and territorial integrity of the Asian and African countries today, and violates the freedom and rights to life of the peoples of all countries. Especially in Africa, millions of people are still under colonial rule, living in extreme poverty, humiliation, and powerlessness. There, racial discrimination and persecution are rampant, countless patriotic people are being slaughtered and imprisoned, and many places have been plunged into misery by the colonizers. At the same time, the most vicious American colonialists are carrying out crazy colonial schemes in the Asian and African regions, attempting to replace the position of the old colonial powers and impose new colonial shackles on the Asian and African peoples. The so-called Southeast Asia Treaty, the Baghdad Treaty, and the notorious Eisenhower Doctrine are tools for the American colonialists to enslave the people of the East. However, the people of Asia have stood up, and the people of Africa have also stood up. They can no longer tolerate the evil colonial system remaining on the lands of Asia and Africa, and can no longer tolerate the aggression and atrocities of imperialism against the Asian and African peoples. The Asian-African Solidarity Conference has issued the most powerful voice: completely eradicate all the evils of colonialism! Wipe colonialism off the face of the earth! This is a major historical task for the Asian and African peoples and the peoples of all countries in the world.

The Asian-African Solidarity Conference's resolution on imperialism is a proclamation denouncing colonialism and imperialism. Based on the Bandung Spirit, this resolution condemns imperialism in all its forms, and foreign interference in the affairs of other countries, as well as the creation of spheres of influence that lead to hegemony. It condemns the Eisenhower Doctrine and the Baghdad Treaty for interfering in the independence of Arab countries and endangering the security of the Middle East. This resolution demands recognition of the full rights to independence of all colonies, protectorates, and UN trust territories, and calls on the Asian and African peoples to provide full support to those peoples who are struggling for their independence and freedom. In this spirit, the conference expressed its full support for the struggles of the peoples of Algeria, Cameroon, Kenya, Uganda, Chad, Togo, Madagascar, and Somaliland in Africa for self-determination and independence, as well as the struggle of the Moroccan people for the unification and full independence of their motherland. These resolutions of the conference will powerfully inspire the peoples in these places who are still groaning under the yoke of imperialism to rise up and overthrow colonialism and end the dark days forever. The conference affirmed Arab rights to Palestine, endorsed the demands of the people of North and South Yemen to liberate the South and unify it with the North, recognized the independence of Oman, and recommended the application of the principle of self-determination to the Cyprus issue. The conference considered that Goa should be returned to India, Okinawa should be returned to Japan, West Irian should be returned to Indonesia, and fully supported the steps taken by the Indonesian government in this struggle. The conference was also concerned about the situation of the Korean and Vietnamese peoples, expressing support for their struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherlands, and demanding an end to imperialist interference in South Vietnam. All these resounding voices will undoubtedly receive a wide response in the Asian and African regions, thereby promoting the entire anti-colonial movement to move forward with even greater force.

The Asian-African Solidarity Conference's resolution on the United Nations criticized the insufficient representation of Asian and African countries in the various agencies of the United Nations, and called for action to correct this disproportionate phenomenon. This proposal is undoubtedly a necessary measure to change the current situation in which the United Nations is manipulated by the United States. The conference also called for the immediate admission of Mongolia to the United Nations, further demonstrating the respect of the Asian and African peoples for countries that have already gained freedom and independence. As everyone knows, Mongolia's application to join the United Nations has been repeatedly rejected by the voting machine manipulated by the United States. The conference also demanded that China's legitimate status in the United Nations be restored. Our people express our gratitude to the representatives of the Asian and African countries for this friendly support. Guo Moruo, the head of our delegation, pointed out in his speech at the conference: We are not prepared to put forward any proposals related to our own interests. Comrade Guo Moruo only declared to his friends: At present, some people are creating a conspiracy of "two Chinas," which the Chinese people firmly oppose. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and we must liberate Taiwan.

The Asian-African Solidarity Conference fully demonstrated that the awakened Asian and African peoples have become a powerful force in defending world peace. The Asian and African peoples not only want to control their own destiny, but also want to actively participate in determining the destiny of all mankind. The Asian and African peoples deeply know that in today's era, peace is indivisible. And the establishment of lasting peace is inseparable from the movement for national independence. Only when the people of all countries achieve independence and equality can a stable situation of lasting peace emerge. This is the goal that we Asian and African countries can and should jointly strive for. Therefore, the Asian and African peoples have always advocated applying the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, which were born on the lands of Asia and Africa, to general international relations, so that they become the common norms for countries with different social systems. People have seen that the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is unwilling to accept these principles. They are still creating divisions and confrontations everywhere, engaging in the Cold War, and desperately promoting the bankrupt "policy of strength" and colonial aggression plans. The Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization held not long ago proved this point. Although the people of the whole world, including the American people, want peace, and although the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries have put forward a series of sincere peace initiatives, the greedy American aggressor group is still frantically carrying out nuclear weapons preparations, and even advocating "preemptive" war to threaten all the peace-loving and freedom-loving people in the world. They are stepping up the establishment of atomic war bases in Europe, Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world, and are also preparing to link the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Treaty, and the Southeast Asia Treaty, vainly attempting to further strengthen their control over all countries participating in these military groups, and firmly tie them to the American war chariot. We, the Asian and African peoples, and the people of the whole world, must never sit idly by in the face of all these evil activities.

In response to this situation, the Asian-African Solidarity Conference discussed the issue of war and peace with particular concern. The speeches of the representatives of various countries and the many resolutions adopted by the conference all issued calls for peace. The conference unanimously agreed that the policies embodied in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference are the best way to ease international tensions and end the Cold War. In order to promote peaceful coexistence between countries, the conference condemned military and political treaties and alliances that threaten world peace and suppress the aspirations of the people, and condemned the establishment of military bases and the stationing of foreign military forces in the territory of other countries. The conference condemned the resolutions of the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for exacerbating the Cold War. In order to promote peaceful coexistence between countries, the conference opposed the arms race, and demanded that major powers must first reduce their armed forces and armaments, especially demanding that the United States and the United Kingdom, as suggested by the Soviet Union, jointly stop nuclear weapons tests from January 1958. The conference suggested that the Asian and African peoples take concerted action on March 1 this year to prevent the United States from conducting nuclear tests in the Pacific, and called on scientists and people of all countries to strive to ban the use of nuclear weapons and destroy stockpiled nuclear weapons. All these are calls from the bottom of the hearts of millions of people, and are fully in line with the common interests of the people of all countries in the world.

This conference also made positive resolutions on developing the economies of Asian and African countries, promoting the cultures of Asian and African nations, and strengthening economic and cultural exchanges between them. The conference opposed imperialist economic aggression and plunder against Asian and African countries, and advocated that the natural resources of all countries be used to develop their national economies for the benefit of their own people. The conference declared that nationalization is a legitimate means and right possessed by every country.

The conference demanded the abolition of unequal status and any discrimination and restrictions in international trade, and advocated mutual assistance and cooperation among Asian and African countries, especially that industrially developed countries should provide genuine assistance to underdeveloped countries. During the conference, the Soviet delegation expressed its willingness to provide economic, financial, and technical assistance to underdeveloped countries without any conditions, which was warmly welcomed by the participants. At the same time, many representatives severely condemned the so-called "aid" from the United States, pointing out that it is a new form of American enslavement of the Asian and African peoples. The conference also opposed the imperialist policies of destroying the cultures of Asian and African nations and hindering cultural exchanges between Asian and African countries, and advocated that Asian and African countries should continue to carry forward their brilliant cultural traditions and make new contributions to world civilization.

What imperialism fears most is the unity of the people. Precisely because of this, the imperialists, headed by the United States, have always adopted a hostile attitude towards the Asian-African Solidarity Conference. Throughout the conference, they used various propaganda weapons and did their utmost to sow discord, trying to prevent the conference from reaching positive agreements. However, they failed. The Asian and African peoples, who have been fighting imperialism for a long time, know how to answer imperialist attempts to sow discord. As Guo Moruo, the head of our delegation, said:
"We will not do what the imperialists are happy about; we will intensify what the imperialists are unhappy about. This can serve as an indicator of our actions."

We believe that under the inspiration of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, the peoples of Asian and African countries will further unite, raise the banner of peace, independence, and friendship even higher, and advance together with the peoples of Europe, the Americas, and all over the world. Today, no force in the world can stop the great awakening and revival of the Asian and African peoples. Our ancestors once created enormous wealth for human civilization. It was only due to the oppression and enslavement of colonialism that the Asian and African peoples experienced a long, long night. Now, it is dawn again, and a fiery red sun has risen. Let the light of peace, independence, freedom, and friendship forever shine on the whole world!

### 亚非团结大会的伟大成就

    亚非团结大会的伟大成就
    亚非十七亿人民，以无限兴奋的心情，遥望开罗，欢庆亚非人民团结大会的胜利闭幕。在那里，聚会七天的亚非人民的使者，一致通过了加强亚非团结，反对帝国主义和殖民主义、反对种族歧视，以及反对核武器和军备竞赛等等一系列重要的决议。这些决议有力地表达了亚非人民争取民族独立、自由平等与世界持久和平的共同要求，并且反映了全世界爱好和平与自由人们的普遍愿望。它不仅对亚非人民，而且在全世界范围内都将发生重大的影响。我国人民竭诚拥护和完全支持大会的决议，我们谨向大会的东道主——埃及政府和人民，向参加大会的亚非各国的代表们表示崇高的敬意。
    亚非团结大会是亚非人民大团结的新阶段。参加这次大会的有将近五十个亚非国家和地方的代表，其中包括许多第一次参加国际会议的非洲殖民地附属国人民的代表。从会议的规模和代表的广泛性来说，这是亚非历史上最大的一次民间性的集会。尽管这些代表有的来自民族独立国家，有的来自社会主义国家，有的来自还没有取得独立地位的国家，但是他们在反对殖民主义和保卫和平的共同斗争中却有着共同的目标。这种团结一致的精神贯穿着各国代表的发言和大会的决议。正如大会通过的“告世界人民书”所说，“亚非人民在支持和平的任务中已经达到了更高度的团结，而且已经达到了有共同的行动纲领的地步。”
    亚非团结大会是亚非人民反对殖民主义和帝国主义的大示威。亚非各国代表在大会上有力地揭发了殖民制度的罪恶，并且愤怒地斥责了帝国主义在亚非地区的侵略活动。亚非人民清楚地看到，今天殖民主义仍然严重地威胁着亚非各国的民族独立与主权领土的完整，侵犯着各国人民的自由和生活权利。特别是在非洲，千百万人民仍处于殖民统治之下，过着极端贫困和屈辱无权的生活。在那里，种族歧视和迫害到处流行，无数爱国人民遭到屠杀和囚禁，许多地方被殖民者置于水深火热之中。同时，最凶恶的美国殖民者正在亚非地区进行着疯狂的殖民阴谋，企图代替老牌殖民国家的地位，把新的殖民枷锁强加于亚非人民。所谓东南亚条约、巴格达条约以及恶名远扬的艾森豪威尔主义，就是美国殖民者奴役东方人民的工具。但是，亚洲人民已经站起来了，非洲人民也站起来了。他们再不能容忍在亚非的土地上仍然保留着罪恶的殖民制度，再不能容忍帝国主义对亚非人民的侵略和暴行。亚非团结大会发出了最强大的声音：彻底铲除殖民主义的一切祸害！把殖民主义从地球上消灭干净！这是亚非人民和世界各国人民当前的一个重大的历史任务。
    亚非团结大会关于帝国主义的决议，是一篇声讨殖民主义和帝国主义的檄文。这个决议根据万隆精神，谴责了以一切表现形式出现的帝国主义，和外国对别国事务的干涉以及造成独霸一方的势力范围。它谴责艾森豪威尔主义和巴格达条约干涉阿拉伯国家的独立，危害中东的安全。这个决议要求承认一切殖民地、保护国以及联合国的托管地完全独立的权利，并号召亚非人民对那些为他们的独立自由而斗争的人民给予充分支持。本着这种精神，大会表示完全支持非洲的阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆、怯尼亚、乌干达、乍得、多哥、马达加斯加和索马里兰人民要求自决和独立的斗争以及摩洛哥人民争取祖国统一和完全独立的斗争。大会的这些决议，将有力地激励这些地方还呻吟在帝国主义脚下的人民，起来打倒殖民主义，永远结束黑暗的日子。大会确认，阿拉伯对巴勒斯坦的权利，赞同也门北部和南部人民关于解放南部并使之与北部统一的要求，承认阿曼独立，并建议在塞浦路斯问题上应用自决的原则。大会认为果阿应该归还印度，冲绳应该归还日本，西伊里安应该归还印度尼西亚，并且完全支持印度尼西亚政府在这一斗争中所采取的步骤。大会也关心到朝鲜人民和越南人民的处境，表示支持他们和平统一祖国的斗争，并且要求停止帝国主义对越南南部的干涉。所有这些响亮的声音，无疑会在亚非地区获得广泛的响应，从而推动整个反殖民主义运动以更大的力量向前发展。
    亚非团结大会关于联合国问题的决议，指责了联合国各个机构中，亚非国家代表权不充分的表现，要求采取行动纠正这种不相称的现象。这个建议，无疑是改变目前联合国为美国操纵的现状所必要的措施。大会并要求立即接纳蒙古加入联合国，更加表现了亚非人民对于已经获得自由和独立的国家的尊重。而尽人皆知，蒙古加入联合国的申请是为美国操纵的表决机器所一再拒绝的。大会并要求必须恢复中国在联合国的合法地位。我国人民对亚非各国代表给我们的这种友好的支持表示感谢。我国代表团团长郭沫若在大会发言中曾经指出：我们不准备提出有关本国利益的任何建议。郭沫若团长只是向朋友们声明：目前有人制造“两个中国”的阴谋，中国人民是坚决反对的。台湾是中国的领土，我们一定要解放台湾。
    亚非团结大会充分显示了觉醒的亚非人民已经成为保卫世界和平的一支强大力量。亚非人民不仅要掌握自己的命运，而且要积极参加决定全人类的命运。亚非人民深深知道，在今日的时代，和平是不可分割的。而持久和平的确立，是同争取民族独立运动分不开的。只有各国人民都获得独立平等，持久和平的稳定局面才可能出现。这是我们亚非各国能够也是应当共同争取的目标。因此，亚非人民一向主张把诞生在亚非土地上的和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则应用到一般国际关系中，使它成为不同社会制度的国家的共同准则。人们看到，以美国为首的帝国主义集团是不愿意接受这些原则的，他们仍然到处制造分裂和对立，进行冷战，并拼命推行破产了的“实力政策”和殖民侵略计划。不久以前召开的北大西洋集团巴黎会议就证明了这一点。尽管包括美国人民在内的全世界人民都要和平，尽管苏联和其他爱好和平国家提出了一系列真诚的和平倡议，但是利欲熏心的美国侵略集团仍然在疯狂地进行核武器备战，甚至鼓吹“先发制人”的战争，来威胁世界上一切爱好和平与自由的人民。他们在欧洲、亚洲、非洲以及世界其他地区加紧建立原子战争基地，还准备把北大西洋集团、巴格达条约和东南亚条约联结起来，妄想进一步加强对所有参加这些军事集团的国家的控制，把它们牢牢拴在美国的战车上。对于所有这些罪恶活动，我们亚非人民和全世界人民是绝不能坐视的。　
    针对这种情况，亚非团结大会以特别关切的心情讨论了战争与和平的问题。各国代表的发言和大会所通过的许多决议都发出了和平的号召。大会一致认为，体现在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的政策，是缓和国际紧张局势和结束冷战的最好方法。为了促进各国之间的和平共处，大会谴责了威胁世界和平和压制人民愿望的军事和政治条约和联盟，谴责了在别国领土上建立军事基地和驻扎外国军事部队的行为。大会谴责北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议的决议加剧了冷战。为了促进各国之间的和平共处，大会反对军备竞赛，而要求大国必须首先裁减武装部队和军备，特别是要求美国和联合王国像苏联所建议的那样，共同从1958年1月开始停止核武器试验。大会建议亚非各国人民在今年3月1日一致行动以阻止美国在太平洋进行核试验，并呼吁各国科学家和人民为禁止使用核武器和销毁贮存的核武器而奋斗。所有这些都是发自千百万人民心底的呼声，是完全符合全世界各国人民的共同利益的。
    这次大会就发展亚非各国经济、繁荣亚非各民族文化和加强相互间的经济与文化交流，也作出了积极的决议。大会反对帝国主义对亚非国家的经济侵略和掠夺，主张把各国的天然资源用于发展本国的民族经济，以造福本国人民。大会宣布，国有化是每个国家所拥有的合法手段和权利。
    大会要求废除国际贸易方面的不平等状态以及任何歧视和限制，而主张亚非各国进行互助合作，特别是工业发达的国家要给予不发达国家以真正的援助。在大会过程中，苏联代表团在大会上表示愿意不附带任何条件对不发达国家提供经济、财政和技术援助，受到了与会代表们的衷心欢迎。同时，许多代表们严厉地谴责了美国的所谓“援助”，指出它是美国奴役亚非人民的新形式。大会并且反对帝国主义摧残亚非各民族文化及阻挠亚非各国文化交流的政策，主张亚非各国能够继续发扬自己的光辉的文化传统，给世界文明做出新的贡献。
    帝国主义最害怕的就是人民的团结一致。正是因为这样，以美国为首的帝国主义始终对亚非团结大会采取敌视的态度。在整个会议进行期间，他们利用各种宣传武器，竭尽挑拨离间的能事，想要影响大会不能达成积极的协议。可是，他们失败了。长期同帝国主义作斗争的亚非人民懂得怎样回答帝国主义的挑拨离间。正如我国代表团团长郭沫若所说：
  “帝国主义者所高兴的事，我们不做；帝国主义者所不高兴的事，我们加紧做。这可以作为我们的行动的一个指标。”
    我们相信，在亚非团结大会的鼓舞下，亚非各国人民一定会更进一步团结起来，更高地举起和平、独立与友谊的旗帜，同欧洲、美洲以及世界各地人民一同前进。今天，世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡亚非人民的伟大的觉醒和复兴。我们的祖先曾经为人类文明创造过巨大的财富，只是由于殖民主义的压迫和奴役，亚非人民才经历了漫漫的长夜。如今，天又亮了，一轮火红的太阳已经升起来了。让和平、独立、自由和友谊的光芒永远照耀着全世界吧！
