    Poplar
    Tu'an
    In the courtyard of our newly built dormitory,
    I personally planted a poplar tree.
    She stands day and night before my window,
    As if standing at her battle post.
    At night she keeps me company studying under the lamp,
    Early in the morning she calls me to rise with the dawn,
    She urges my work at the desk every day,
    And when I am tired, she casts a comforting gaze.
    She laughs and chatters with the children in the same courtyard,
    And gossips with the old folks about everyday matters.
    She quietly listens to the sweet words of lovers,
    She joins our families in peaceful chorus.
    I heard that this place was an execution ground before Liberation,
    Great construction has eliminated the desolation.
    But people can't forget the blood shed by the martyrs,
    And the heroic spirits underground will certainly not forget us.
    Perhaps a brave warrior is buried in the soil of this courtyard,
    A spiritual energy condensed into a rustling poplar,
    She not only participated in creating our happy life,
    But today continues to inspire us to live, fight, and sing...

    白杨
    屠岸
    在我们新盖的宿舍的院子里
    我亲手栽下了一棵白杨，
    她日夜站立在我的窗前，
    好像站在她战斗的岗位上。
    晚上她陪伴我在灯光下学习，
    一清早她呼唤我迎着晨光起床，
    她天天督促我案头的工作，
    我倦了她就投来抚慰的目光。
    她跟同院的孩子们一道呵呵笑嚷，
    又跟老人们絮语着闲话家常，
    她静静地聆听爱人们甜蜜的情话，
    她参加了我们一家家和平的合唱。
    听说解放前这里是杀人的刑场，
    巨大的建设消灭了满目的凄凉，
    人们却忘不了先烈们洒下的鲜血，
    地下的英灵一定也不会把我们遗忘。
    也许有一位壮士就葬在这庭院的土中，
    一股灵气凝聚成一株萧萧的白杨，
    她不仅参与缔造了我们幸福的生活，
    今天还继续鼓舞我们生活、战斗、歌唱……
