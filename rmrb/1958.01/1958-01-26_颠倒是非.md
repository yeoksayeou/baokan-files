Notes

    Turning Black and White Upside Down
    In his reply to Bulganin, Eisenhower, using various excuses, dismissed a series of peace proposals put forward by the Soviet Union as meaningless, attempting to write them off, and placing all the blame on the Soviet Union. This included the proposal to expand scientific, cultural, and athletic exchanges. Today, after reading the facts listed in the testimony of Dr. Weaver, a leader of the American scientific community, before the House of Representatives, and seeing a series of "episodes in a comedy" that "have become a laughingstock internationally," people once again see through Eisenhower's reply, and how it turns black and white upside down.

    颠倒是非
    艾森豪威尔在致布尔加宁的复信里，对于苏联提出的一系列和平建议，曾用种种借口，把它们说成是毫无意义的，企图加以一笔抹煞，并且把一切罪过都推到苏联头上。其中，也包括扩大科学、文化和体育性质的联系的建议。今天，读了美国科学界领袖韦佛尔博士在众院的作证词所列举的事实，看到了一连串“在国际上被传为笑柄”的“喜剧中的情节”，人们又一次看透了艾森豪威尔的复信，是怎样在颠倒是非的。
