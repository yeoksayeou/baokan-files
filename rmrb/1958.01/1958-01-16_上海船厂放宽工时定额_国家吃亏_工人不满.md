    Shanghai Shipyard Relaxes Work Quotas
    National Loss, Worker Dissatisfaction

    (This report comes from the Liberation Daily) Shanghai Shipyard, during the rectification movement in August of last year, the leadership did not deeply understand the situation and unilaterally accommodated the backward demands of a small number of people by relaxing quotas, resulting in adverse consequences.

    The factory's quotas were not tight to begin with. Taking the assembly work of the hull workshop as an example, in the three months from June to August, all piece-rate workers exceeded their quotas, some by a large margin. Among them, in June, 33 people exceeded the quota by 20% to 50%; in July, 61 people exceeded the quota by 30% to 80%; and in August, all 73 people exceeded the quota, with an average excess of 35%. Under these circumstances, the quotas should have been adjusted and tightened, but the factory leadership instead accommodated the backward demands of a small number of people, and in September, the quotas were relaxed by an average of 12.6%. As a result, in the following months, workers not only exceeded their quotas, but also exceeded them by an average of 7.8% more than in the previous months. Similar situations occurred in the fitter and boring worker groups of the No. 1 Engine Workshop and the fitter group of the Internal Combustion Engine Workshop. According to a comparison of the total wage expenditures for the more than 1,000 people doing piecework each month in the factory, the average wage per person in the first half of the year was only 67 yuan, but it increased to 79 yuan in the second half of the year. It is estimated that the state had to spend tens of thousands of yuan more as a result.

    Unprincipled relaxation of quotas not only caused losses to the state, but also left a bad impression among the workers. Many time-rate workers have opinions and demand to do piecework. Some bad ideas have also emerged among some piece-rate workers. For example, some workers who have already exceeded their quota by 10% to 20% are still not satisfied and feel that they are "losing out." Another example is a work group which, in order to complete the plan on time or ahead of schedule, wanted twenty-two people to help them work, but they were refused, because this group believed that they had exceeded the quota by a large margin and "couldn't let others get a piece of the pie." As some quota clerks said, they originally thought that relaxing the quota would make things easier, but now it seems to be the opposite. The number of people who are arguing and demanding even lower quotas has increased.

    At present, the factory's Party committee has begun to realize that accommodating backwardness, failing to raise the consciousness of the masses, and failing to rely on advanced workers, using the method of relaxing quotas to please some of the masses, and replacing the mass line with tailism, this kind of rectification is completely wrong. Now, it is organizing relevant personnel to conduct a more in-depth inspection and is preparing to deal with this issue in the spirit of rectification.

### 上海船厂放宽工时定额  国家吃亏　工人不满

    上海船厂放宽工时定额
    国家吃亏　工人不满
    本报讯　据解放日报报道：上海船厂去年8月份开展整风运动时，领导上没有深入了解情况，片面地迁就少数人的落后要求放宽定额，造成了不良的结果。
    这个厂的定额本来并不紧。以船体车间装配工种来说，从6月到8月的三个月中，全部计件工人都超额，有的超额很多。其中6月份有三十三人超额20％到50％；7月份六十一人超额30％到80％；8月份七十三人全部超额，平均超额达35％。在这种情况下，理应调整紧缩定额，但该厂领导上却相反迁就了少数人的落后要求，9月份平均放宽了定额12.6％，因此以后几个月工人不但全部超额，而且比前几个月还平均高出7.8％。其他如一轮机车间的钳工和搪工、内燃机车间的钳工等也有类似情况。根据全厂每月平均有一千多人做计件活的工资支出总额两相比较，上半年每人平均工资只有六十七元，下半年增加到七十九元，估计国家因此要多支出几万元。
    无原则地放宽定额不仅造成国家损失，在工人中也留下了不良影响。不少计时工人有意见，要求做计件活。部分计件工人中也产生了一些不好的思想。譬如，有些工人已超额10％到20％，仍不满足，认为“吃亏了”。又如有个小组，领导上为了能按期或超额完成计划，要让二十二个人去帮助他们工作，可是却被拒绝了，因为这个小组认为自己超额多，“肥肉不能让别人插一脚”。正如某些定额员所说的，原来以为放宽定额好办事，现在看来恰恰相反，吵吵闹闹要求做更低的定额的人增加了。
    目前该厂党委已开始认识到：迁就落后，不提高群众的觉悟，不依靠先进工人，以放宽定额的办法讨好部分群众，以尾巴主义代替群众路线，这样整改是完全错误的。现在，正组织有关人员做更深入的检查，并准备以整风的精神来处理这个问题。
