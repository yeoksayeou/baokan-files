Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, January 2nd. China's first two Yellow River icebreakers successfully completed their trial voyage on December 30, 1957, in Luokou, Jinan. These two Yellow River icebreakers, named "Shandong Keling No. 1" and "Keling No. 2," were manufactured by the Shanghai Zhonghua Shipyard. According to their design capabilities, they can break ice layers up to five decimeters thick.

The Yellow River stretches for a thousand miles within Shandong Province. In the one hundred and two years since the Yellow River changed its course, there have been thirty-five ice flood breaches, two of which occurred after liberation, seriously threatening the lives of people along both banks of the Yellow River in Shandong. Since liberation, Shandong Province has adopted various methods to combat ice floods, such as artillery bombardment, aerial bombing, dynamite blasting, and manual ice breaking. The completion of these two icebreakers further strengthens the power to conquer ice floods.

    两艘黄河破冰船制成
    据新华社济南2日电　我国首次制造的两艘黄河破冰船1957年12月30日在济南洛口试航。这两艘命名为山东克凌一号、克凌二号的黄河破冰船，是由上海中华造船厂制造的。按照设计效能，它们可以破除厚度在五公寸以下的冰层。
    黄河在山东境内长达千里，从黄河改道到现在的一百零二年中，出现过三十五次凌汛决口，解放以后就遇到过两次，严重威胁着山东沿黄河两岸人民的生命安全。解放以后，山东省曾采取了炮轰、飞机炸、炸药轰以及人力打冰等多种办法和凌汛斗争，这两艘破冰船制成以后，更加壮大了征服凌汛的力量。
