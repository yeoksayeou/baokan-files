Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 24th: The thirteen local state-owned Cantonese opera troupes currently performing in Guangzhou are rehearsing a selection of excellent plays and short skits, preparing to go to the countryside, factories, and military units to perform for workers, peasants, and soldiers during the half-month period around the Spring Festival.

　　Famous Cantonese opera actors Ma Shizeng and Hong Xiannu, who are preparing to go to Zhuhai County by the sea for the Spring Festival, will perform for the local fishermen and border and coastal defense soldiers. Other Cantonese opera troupes will perform at reservoir construction sites or old revolutionary base areas, while others will perform in suburban agricultural cooperatives.

　　This artistic contingent of nearly nine hundred people going to the countryside, factories, and military units for performances is a pioneering effort in the Guangdong Cantonese opera community in recent years. The troupes are preparing to take this Spring Festival performance as the beginning of regular visits to the countryside and factories in the future.

    排演好戏  春节下乡
    据新华社广州24日电　现在广州市演出的十三个地方国营粤剧团正在排练一些精选出的好剧目和短剧，准备在春节前后的半个月里，下乡下厂下部队为工农兵演出。
    准备春节到滨海的珠海县的粤剧名演员马师曾、红线女，将为那里的渔民和边防、海防战士演出。其他的粤剧团，有的到水库工地或革命老根据地演出，有的到郊区农业社演出。
    这支近九百人组成的艺术队伍下乡下厂下部队演出，是几年来广东粤剧界的创举。各剧团准备把这次春节送上门的活动，作为今后经常下乡下厂的开始。
