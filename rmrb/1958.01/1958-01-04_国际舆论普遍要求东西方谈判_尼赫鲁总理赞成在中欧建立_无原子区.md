Xinhua News Agency dispatches: Demands for East-West negotiations, particularly direct talks between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union, have formed an overwhelming consensus internationally. These demands continue to be voiced in the statements of leaders of various countries and in newspapers.

		Indian Prime Minister's Remarks

New Delhi Dispatch: Nehru, speaking at a press conference on the 2nd, commented on the recent North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Paris, saying that the discussions at the meeting were not developing in the direction of mutual convergence. He said, "Firstly, the proposal to distribute missiles was not very well received. People are not very enthusiastic about these missiles because they consider them dangerous. Secondly, there is a general desire for talks between the East and the West." Prime Minister Nehru welcomed the Polish government's proposal to establish a "nuclear-free zone" in Central Europe.

		Norwegian Prime Minister's New Year's Address

Oslo Dispatch: Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen, in his New Year's broadcast address on the 1st, called for "realistic negotiations" between East and West. He said that hopes for disarmament had suffered setbacks in 1957, and he believed that direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union might more easily lead to a solution.

		Words of the Ethiopian Emperor

Addis Ababa Dispatch: Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I, speaking to a reporter from the Yugoslav newspaper "Borba," pointed out that only the path of negotiation can guarantee world peace and justice, while war is a poor way to resolve international disputes. Selassie I said that Ethiopia firmly believes that the Bandung Principles will help strengthen international cooperation and consolidate peace among the peoples of all countries. He said that Ethiopia hopes to maintain friendly relations with all countries, regardless of their political systems.

		Appeals from American Newspapers

New York Dispatch: "The Philadelphia Inquirer" published an article calling on the United States to negotiate with the Soviet Union.

The newspaper criticized Secretary of State Dulles's argument that stepping up the arms race while considering negotiations with the Soviet Union a "waste of time." The newspaper wrote: "When it comes to Soviet peace proposals, we always demand 'actions, not empty words.' This, like a worn-out record, cannot convince people but only annoys them. It is time to change to a new record and a new song."

"The Philadelphia Inquirer" suggested that the U.S. government invite Soviet leaders and other heads of government to visit the United States as a first step in this regard.

"The New York Times" published an editorial on the 2nd saying that U.S. foreign policy should not adopt a "smug and tough attitude." Americans should recognize that "the Russians live on this planet with us, and if we are to live, both sides should live here peacefully." The editorial advocated for "constantly exploring every opportunity for private probing in all aspects" regarding high-level meetings. The United States "should sincerely seek areas of agreement—even the smallest ones, and should not reject any Soviet note without even looking at it, nor should it leave it unanswered for a long time."

However, "The New York Times," which reflects the views of monopoly capital groups, also advocated that the United States "first needs to strengthen (American) military power with all kinds of new weapons."

		Voices from the British Public

London Dispatch: The Hull City Council in northern England passed a resolution on the 2nd calling for a summit meeting to prevent the possibility of armed conflict and expressing shock at the government's permission for the United States to establish missile bases in Britain.

The Labor Party's left-wing "Tribune" weekly criticized Labor leader Gaitskell's cold attitude toward high-level talks in an editorial on the 3rd. "Tribune" weekly said that what the country needs, and what the Labor Party's rank and file are demanding, is to launch a loud campaign inside and outside Parliament to force a change in national policy.

"The Daily Mirror," the British newspaper with the largest circulation, also called on the government to begin talks with Soviet leaders to resolve international problems. It pointed out in an editorial: There is a huge gap between public opinion and government policy. Public opinion wants high-level talks with Russia to begin immediately. However, government leaders are doing their best to avoid this issue.

    国际舆论普遍要求东西方谈判
    尼赫鲁总理赞成在中欧建立“无原子区”
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：要求举行东西方谈判特别是美苏两国首脑直接谈判的呼声，已经在国际上形成一种压倒性的共鸣。在各国领导人的言论中，在报纸上，继续纷纷发出这个要求。
                印度总理一席话
    新德里消息：尼赫鲁2日在记者招待会上谈到北大西洋公约组织最近在巴黎举行的最高级会议时说，这个会议的讨论不是朝着某种互相接近的方向发展的。他说，“首先，分配导弹的建议并没有受到很多欢迎。人们并不很热心要这些导弹，因为人们认为这些导弹是危险的。其次，人们普遍希望东西方举行会谈。”尼赫鲁总理对波兰政府提出的关于在中欧建立“无原子区”的建议表示欢迎。
              挪威首相的新年演说
    奥斯陆消息：挪威首相基哈德森在1日发表新年广播演说，要求东西方之间举行“实事求是的谈判”。他说，裁军的希望在1957年遭到了挫折，他相信美国和苏联之间的直接谈判可能更易于求得一项解决问题的办法。
              埃塞俄比亚皇帝的话
    亚的斯亚贝巴消息：埃塞俄比亚皇帝海尔·塞拉西一世对南斯拉夫“战斗报”记者指出，只有谈判的道路才能保证世界和平和正义，而战争是解决国际争端的拙劣办法。塞拉西一世说，埃塞俄比亚坚信，万隆原则将有助于加强国际合作事业和巩固各国人民之间的和平。他说，埃塞俄比亚希望同所有国家（不管它们的政治制度如何）保持友好关系。
              美国报纸的呼吁
    纽约消息：“费城问询报”发表一篇文章，呼吁美国同苏联进行谈判。
    这家报纸抨击国务卿杜勒斯鼓吹加紧扩充军备而认为同苏联谈判是“白费时间”的论调。报纸写道：“当谈到苏联的和平建议时，我们总是要求‘拿出行动而不是空话’，这跟磨钝了的唱针一样，不能说服人民，而是使他们生气。现在是该换上新唱针和新唱片的时候了”。
    “费城问询报”建议美国政府邀请苏联领导人以及其他国家政府首脑来美国访问，作为在这方面的第一步。
    “纽约时报”2日发表社论说，美国外交政策不要采取“自以为是的强硬态度”。美国人应该承认，“俄国人同我们一起生活在这个星球上，如果我们要活下去，双方就应当在这里和平地生活。”社论主张对于举行最高级会议“要经常在各方面利用每一个机会进行私下的探索”。美国“应当真心诚意地寻求意见一致的方面——即使是最小的方面，不应当连看都没看过就拒绝俄国的任何照会；也不应当长久不作答复”。
    但是，这家反映垄断资本集团意见的“纽约时报”又鼓吹，美国“首先需要的是要用各种新式武器加强（美国）方面的军事力量。”
                英国公众的呼声
    伦敦消息：英格兰北部的赫尔市政委员会2日通过决议，要求举行最高级会谈来制止武装冲突的可能性，并且对政府允许美国在英国建立火箭基地表示震惊。
    工党左翼“论坛”周报3日在社论中批评工党领袖盖次克尔对最高级会谈采取冷淡态度。“论坛”周报说，国家所需要的，工党下层党员所要求的，是在议会内外展开一场大声疾呼的运动，来迫使国家的政策有所改变。
    发行量最大的英国报纸“每日镜报”也要求政府同苏联领导人开始进行解决国际问题的会谈。它在社论中指出：在社会舆论和政府政策中间存在着巨大的鸿沟。社会舆论希望同俄国马上开始高级会谈。但是，政府领导人却极力躲避这个问题。
