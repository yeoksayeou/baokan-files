In Chongqing's winter, the biting north wind, carrying drizzling rain, lashed against the face. A thin fog shrouded the mountains, and the construction site was a muddy mess.

The workers of the Third Work Section of the 104th Work Area, determined to strive to complete and overfulfill the production tasks for the final month of the First Five-Year Plan, paid no attention to this light rain and continued to work. In the distance, from within the grey shed, came the sound of several people arguing. Xie Xuejun, the technical section chief, leading several professional foremen, was inspecting the project's quality and safety. Hearing the argument, they walked in that direction.

"Comrades, what's all the commotion about?" Section Chief Xie asked kindly.

"The warehouse is out of long rubber boots, and we only got two or three pairs of tattered ones. When mixing mortar, the slurry leaks in and our feet can't take it, and those carrying the slurry are going to fall without rubber boots!" Liu Jinkui, the manual labor team leader, replied, at a loss.

"You comrades can use my pair first." Section Chief Xie said, immediately bending down to take off his pair of brand-new long rubber boots.

"I have a pair too!" Tang Shaowen and the other four foremen who came with Section Chief Xie to inspect the work, prompted by Section Chief Xie's example, also took off their own rubber boots.

"Section Chief Xie used to be all dressed up in Western suits every day. How has he become so good today?" Little Jiang said mischievously, watching the backs of Section Chief Xie and the others as they walked away.

"What do you know, kid? Section Chief Xie has already put down his airs. Ever since the Party proposed the rectification campaign, he has been eating, living, and laboring alongside the workers. He helps lift things that the workers can't lift, and he helps carry things that they can't carry. Ask around and see if any worker comrade doesn't say that Section Chief Xie has changed for the better," Old Gan said earnestly.

"The rectification campaign is really good..." Team Leader Liu Jinkui interjected happily.

The drizzle continued to fall, and the north wind continued to howl, but the workers felt very warm inside. They worked even harder and better.

    谢段长让鞋记
    邹懋全
    重庆的冬天，凛冽的北风，卷着蒙蒙的细雨迎面扑来，薄雾笼罩着群山，建筑工地上是一遍泥泞。
    一○四工区三工段的工人们，为了争取完成和超额完成第一个五年计划最后一月的生产任务，根本不把这种小雨放在心里，仍然坚持工作着。远处灰棚内传来了几个人的争吵声。技术工段长谢雪君率领着几个专业工长，正来到工地检查工程质量和安全生产。听到争吵声，他们就向这个方向走了过去。
    “同志们，吵什么啊？”谢段长亲切地问着。
    “库房已经没有长统胶靴了，我们只领来了两三双破破烂烂的。拌灰时浆漏进去了脚受不了，挑浆的没胶鞋穿也要摔跟斗的”！手工组长刘金奎一筹莫展地回答着。
    “我这一双同志们先穿着使用再说”。谢段长说着，就马上弯下身去把脚上穿的一双全新长统胶靴脱下来。
    “我这儿也有一双！”和谢段长一起来检查工作的唐少文等四个工长，在谢段长的带动下，也一起脱下自己的胶靴。
    “谢段长过去整天西装革履的，今天怎么变得这样好？”小蒋望着谢段长等一伙远去的背影，调皮地说。
    “你小子知道啥，人家谢段长早已放下架子了。自从党提出整风以来，他就是与工人同吃，同住，同劳动，看着工人抬不动的，就帮着抬，挑不起的，就帮着挑。你不信问一问看，那一个工人同志不说谢段长转变得好”。老甘头认真地接口说。
    “整风真正好……。”刘金奎组长也高兴地插嘴说。
    小雨仍在飞舞，北风仍在呼啸；但工人们内心却感到很温暖。他们干得更多更好。
