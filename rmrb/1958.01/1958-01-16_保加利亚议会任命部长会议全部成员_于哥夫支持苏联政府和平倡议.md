Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 14th: Bulgarian Council of Ministers Chairman Yugov attended the swearing-in ceremony of new students at the Levski People's Military Academy on the 12th and delivered a speech at the ceremony.

　　In his speech, Yugov pointed out that, according to the Warsaw Pact, the Bulgarian People's Army is an integral part of the socialist camp's armed forces, headed by the Soviet Union. Its lofty patriotic and internationalist task is: together with the armies of socialist countries, headed by the Soviet army, to be ready at any time to defend world peace. Yugov called on the students of the military academy to not only strive to master new and increasingly sophisticated modern technical knowledge, but also to diligently study Marxism-Leninism, strengthen discipline, and enhance physical fitness. He said that constantly mastering the great Marxist-Leninist theory and creatively applying it to socialist construction and military science and practice is a regular task for commanders.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 14th: The first special session of the Third Bulgarian National Assembly closed on the afternoon of the 14th.

　　At the closing meeting, the proposal of Council of Ministers Chairman Yugov was unanimously adopted, appointing the Vice-Chairmen of the Council of Ministers and the Ministers of various ministries. The First Vice-Chairmen are L. Damyanov and Traikov, and the Vice-Chairmen are Mikhailov (concurrently Minister of Transport and Post and Telecommunications) and Chervenkov (concurrently Minister of Education and Culture). The original ministers of all ministries were reappointed without any changes. Subsequently, Yugov, on behalf of all newly appointed members of the Council of Ministers, expressed sincere gratitude for the trust of the National Assembly. He also explained the Bulgarian government's domestic and foreign policies. Yugov pointed out that the Bulgarian government believes that the Soviet government's initiative to hold a summit meeting to discuss and resolve pressing international issues is of great significance. Yugov also declared that the Bulgarian government, on behalf of all the people, welcomes the Soviet decision to reduce its armed forces.
