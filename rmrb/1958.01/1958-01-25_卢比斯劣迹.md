Character Introduction

    Lubis's Misdeeds
    Lubis is currently thirty-five years old and an Indonesian Army Colonel. In his early years, he received training from British intelligence agencies and worked for the Japanese army in intelligence during the Japanese occupation. After Indonesia's independence, he served as the director of the intelligence department of the Army Headquarters and was later promoted to Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army. In May 1955, when Army Chief of Staff Major General Sugandhi resigned, he temporarily took over as Chief of Staff. In June of the same year, he refused to hand over the position to the new Chief of Staff, Major General Udojo, which caused a cabinet crisis and forced the Sastroamidjojo cabinet to resign. In November of the same year, after Lubis handed over the position to the current Army Chief of Staff, Major General Nasution, he launched three coups in 1956, attempting to overthrow the government, but all failed. After the failed coup in mid-November of the same year, Lubis was wanted and immediately went into hiding.
