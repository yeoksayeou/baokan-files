Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 23rd: Higher education institutions in Chongqing are further mobilizing the masses to launch an anti-waste campaign, and are simultaneously addressing the initially exposed problems by immediately beginning to resolve those that can be quickly solved.

According to exposures, Chongqing University, influenced by the ideology of "seeking breadth and quality" over the past few years, has excessively large building areas. Currently, the average living area for each faculty and staff member and their families at this university reaches 42 square meters, which is more than ten square meters more than the average living area for Chongqing municipal government employees. The average teaching space per student is 12 square meters, which greatly exceeds the highest target stipulated by the Ministry of Higher Education. Many classrooms are only used for half a day or a few hours, and laboratories are often unused in the mornings, with some laboratories only being used for a few hours a week. In the 1957 capital construction projects of Chongqing University, projects that should have been completed in 1956 exceeded the budget by 96,000 yuan, with the student dormitory exceeding the original budget by 10%, and the cost per square meter reaching 63.6 yuan, which is 27% to 45% higher than the cost of student dormitories at the Southwest Agricultural College and the Chengdu Institute of Technology during the same period. Waste in capital construction is also significant in other schools. Currently, schools are working to improve based on the revealed waste. Chongqing University, Chongqing Medical College, and Chongqing Institute of Architectural Engineering are conducting investigations and research on the rational utilization of housing. Chongqing Medical College has already proposed a preliminary adjustment plan. After Chongqing University rationally adjusts its housing, it plans to forego the construction of over 6,800 square meters of new student dormitories and laboratories that were originally planned for this year.

The schools have exposed the problem of stockpiled teaching instruments. Chongqing Medical College and Southwest Agricultural College alone have over 56,000 yuan worth of stockpiled equipment. More than ten teaching and research sections at Chongqing Medical College also have small storage rooms; instruments that only need to be used once or twice, or drugs that only need to be used in quantities of one or two grams, are locked in their own small storage rooms in whole pieces or bottles. Expensive color film and high-speed flashes, which are not fundamentally necessary in medicine, were nevertheless purchased by the photography studio at Chongqing Medical College. Chongqing University, which does not have a foundry specialty, purchased a die-casting machine worth more than 40,000 yuan for the school's training factory, and it has remained unopened for more than three years. Now, more than ten teaching and research sections at Chongqing Medical College have criticized the ideologies of greed for quantity and quality and departmentalism, and have proposed that surplus instruments and drugs be transferred to the school for unified use. Many teaching and research sections have also proposed reducing the purchase of instruments and drugs in 1958. The human anatomy teaching and research section alone has proposed reducing the purchase of a refrigerator and a chest localization device, which would save 6,000 yuan.

In early January, the heads of general affairs of Chongqing's nine higher education institutions conducted detailed research on the problem of waste in student welfare. Currently, the food standards for students in various higher education institutions have been appropriately reduced. Students have proactively proposed transporting rice, coal, and vegetables themselves to save on food costs. After careful calculation, many students have voluntarily given up or reduced the amount of their People's Assistance Grants. Southwest Agricultural College has tightened the number of students receiving assistance grants from 77% to 60%-70% based on students' specific circumstances, and has also revised the fee system for public medical care and other aspects.

### 重庆高等学校进一步发动群众  一面揭发浪费一面改进工作

    重庆高等学校进一步发动群众
    一面揭发浪费一面改进工作
    新华社重庆23日电　重庆市高等学校中正在进一步发动群众展开反浪费斗争，同时对初步揭发出来的问题，能马上解决的立即着手解决。
    据揭发，重庆大学几年来因为“求宽求好”的思想支配，房屋的建筑面积过大。目前这个学校每户教职员工和他们的家属平均居住面积达到四十二平方公尺，比重庆市机关工作人员每户平均居住面积还多十几平方公尺。学生教学用房平均每人占十二平方公尺，大大超过了高等教育部规定的最高指标。很多教室只用了半天或几小时，实验室上午常常无人去作实验，有的实验室甚至一星期也只用几小时。1957年重庆大学基本建设工程中1956年应完工而未完工的工程共超出预算九万六千元，其中学生宿舍一项超出原预算10％，每平方公尺造价高达六十三点六元，比同一时期西南农学院和成都工学院学生宿舍造价高出27％到45％。其他一些学校基本建设浪费也很大。现在，各校根据揭发的浪费情况，着手改进。重庆大学、重庆医学院和重庆建筑工程学院正在进行房屋合理利用的调查研究。重庆医学院已经提出了初步调整方案。重庆大学合理调整房屋后，原计划今年新建的六千八百多平方公尺的学生宿舍和实验室，准备不建了。
    各校揭发教学仪器积压的情况，仅重庆医学院和西南农学院就达五万六千多元。重庆医学院十多个教研组还设有小库房；只须使用一两次的仪器或使用一两克的药品，也都成件成瓶地锁在自己的小库房里。医学上根本可以不用贵重的五彩胶卷和万次闪光灯，可是重庆医学院的摄影室却把它买来了。重庆大学根本没有铸工专业，学校的实习工厂却买来了一部价值四万多元的压铸机，三年多来一直没有开过箱。现在重庆医学院十几个教研组已经批判了贪多图好和本位主义思想，提议把多余的仪器、药品调出来交学校统一使用。许多教研组还提出减购1958年的仪器和药品，仅人体解剖教研组提出减购的电冰箱和胸内定向器两件仪器，就可节约六千元。
    重庆九所高等学校的总务长在1月上旬对各校生活福利方面的浪费问题作了详细研究。现在，各高等学校学生的伙食标准已适当降低。学生们主动提出自己搬运米、煤、菜蔬来节约伙食费用。许多学生经过精打细算后，自动放弃或少领人民助学金。西南农学院已根据学生具体情况把领助学金的人数由占77％紧缩到占60％——70％，并且修订了公费医疗等方面的收费制度。
