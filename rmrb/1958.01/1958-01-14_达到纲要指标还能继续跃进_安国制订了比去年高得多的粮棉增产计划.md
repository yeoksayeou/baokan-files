Xinhua News Agency, Baoding Electric Dispatch: In advanced areas where grain and cotton production have already reached the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), can production continue to leap forward? How much potential is there? Where is the key? These questions have been resolved in Anguo County, Hebei Province.

This year, Anguo County plans to increase grain and cotton production from 464 jin and 50 jin last year to 600 jin and 80 jin, respectively. In order to ascertain the potential for increased production and continue to lead the leap forward, the Anguo County Party Committee, in conjunction with summarizing the experience of increased production in 1957, conducted serious investigations, research, and analysis in townships and communes with different conditions.

According to the County Party Committee's analysis, intensive cultivation is one of the primary keys to further leaps forward. Last year, Anguo County had over 100,000 mu of well-irrigated land with good soil quality, but because the ridges were uneven, although there were wells for irrigation, small and frequent irrigation could not be achieved, which seriously affected increased production. However, some耕地 (gēngdì) with poorer soil quality had higher yields than the land with better soil quality due to careful cultivation, level ground, and even fertilization. According to investigations, just by achieving intensive cultivation, these irrigated lands could produce more than 100 jin of grain per mu. Draft animals are an important guarantee for achieving intensive cultivation. After analyzing the favorable conditions for increased production in all communes throughout the county last year, the County Party Committee plans to add 6,000 head of draft animals to solve the shortage of animal power. Last year's experience in increased production proved that improved varieties also play a significant role in increasing production. According to comparative surveys, after corn, sweet potato, wheat, and other seeds were improved from inferior varieties, they generally increased production by about 30%; therefore, Anguo County will realize the use of improved varieties for all crops this year.

With the development of production, the issue of agricultural mechanization has been raised. Anguo County has basically achieved water conservancy, but the existing small well water sources and water lifting tools cannot meet the needs of further leaps in production. According to investigations,耕地 (gēngdì) irrigated by mechanized wells can increase production by 10% to 20% compared to general brick wells and waterwheel irrigation due to sufficient water head and even irrigation. This year, the county plans to dig another 518 mechanized wells to expand the mechanized irrigation area to 400,000 mu; the remaining 100,000 mu of耕地 (gēngdì) will also be irrigated using multi-pipe wells. This will also free up a large number of laborers for intensive cultivation. Due to the dramatic increase in fertilizer application, Anguo County has also decided to add a number of rubber-wheeled carts to ensure the completion of manure and soil delivery tasks. Under the conditions of abundant water and fertilizer, the demand for mechanized plowing is also urgent. According to typical investigation comparisons, mechanically plowed land can yield more than 30 jin of grain per mu than animal-plowed land. Because the existing tractors cannot meet the needs, Anguo County has proposed the method of using manual digging to a depth of one chi (foot) to replace tractor deep plowing on 150,000 mu of land. This year, 200,000 mu of land throughout the county will reach the level of mechanized plowing. Currently, the digging plan has been basically completed.

The total investment in production construction in Anguo County this year requires 6 million yuan, which averages more than 20 yuan per person based on the county's population. Due to the bumper harvest last year, 50% of the county's 172 agricultural cooperatives have reached or exceeded the production level and income level of local well-to-do middle peasants. The public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives has expanded, and the general retention ratio has increased by about 10% compared to the previous year. In this way, the production construction funds retained by agricultural cooperatives alone amount to 4 million yuan. The county's credit cooperatives can also help solve one-twentieth of the funds, plus the investment of individual cooperative members and the support of a small amount of state loans, and the funding problem can be completely solved.

The Anguo County Party Committee pointed out that the key to further leaps in production lies in the leadership proposing advanced and clear production increase targets so that the masses feel they have something to strive for. As early as after the autumn harvest last year, the County Party Committee formulated a leap forward plan to increase grain by 28.5% and cotton by 60% compared to last year, and successively convened two meetings of township and commune cadres with more than 2,000 people to conduct publicity and deployment in conjunction with awards, and at the same time launched debates on further leaps in production in various townships and communes to help cadres and the masses overcome right-leaning complacency and lead the county's cadres and masses to continue to move forward.

Now, the masses in Anguo County have high production enthusiasm, and more than 118,000 male and female laborers are involved in winter production every day. Entering Anguo County, you can see a busy scene that surpasses the competition for autumn harvest and wheat harvesting everywhere.

### 达到纲要指标还能继续跃进  安国制订了比去年高得多的粮棉增产计划

    达到纲要指标还能继续跃进
    安国制订了比去年高得多的粮棉增产计划
    新华社保定电　在粮棉生产已经达到全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）指标的先进地区，产量能不能继续跃进？潜力有多大？窍门在那里？这些问题在河北省安国县已经得到解决。
    安国县今年计划将粮、棉产量分别由去年的四百六十四斤和五十斤提高到六百斤和八十斤。为了摸清增产潜力，继续组织领导跃进，中共安国县委曾结合总结1957年增产经验，深入到条件不同的乡、社作了认真的调查研究和分析。
    根据县委分析，精耕细作是再跃进的首要关键之一。安国县去年有十几万亩土质较好的水浇地，因为畦田高低不平，虽然有井可灌，却不能做到小水勤浇，所以严重地影响增产。但有些土质较差的耕地，由于耕作细致，地平、肥匀，产量就比土质较好的地还高。据调查，仅做到精耕细作这项，这些水浇地每亩就能多产粮食一百多斤。耕畜是做到精耕细作的重要保证，县委在分析了去年全县社社增产的有利条件以后，计划增添耕畜六千头，解决畜力不足的困难。去年的增产经验证明，优良品种对增产的作用也很大。据调查对比，玉米、甘薯、小麦等籽种由劣改优以后，一般能增产三成上下；为此，安国县要在今年实现全部作物优种化。
    随着生产的发展，农业机械化的问题提出来了。安国县已经基本上实现水利化，但是现有的小井水源和提水工具不能适应生产再跃进的需要。据调查，机井灌溉的耕地，由于水头足，浇的匀，比一般砖井、水车浇地能增产10％到20％。今年全县计划再打机井五百一十八眼，使机灌面积扩大到四十万亩；其余十万多亩耕地也改用多管水井浇。这样，还可以省出大批劳力来精耕细作。由于耕地施肥量剧增，安国县还决定添置一部分胶轮车，以保证完成送粪、送土的任务。在水大粪足的条件下，机耕的要求也迫切了。据典型调查对比，机耕地比畜耕地每亩能多收粮食三十多斤。因为现有拖拉机不能满足需要，安国县提出了采用人工掘地一尺深的办法，代替拖拉机深耕十五万亩地，今年全县将有二十万亩地达到机耕程度。现在，掘地计划已经基本完成。
    安国县今年用于生产建设的投资共需六百万元，按全县人口平均计算，每人合二十元多。由于去年丰收，全县一百七十二个农业社已有50％达到或超过当地富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平，农业社的公共积累扩大，一般扣留比例都比前一年提高10％左右。这样，仅从农业社扣留的生产建设资金就有四百万元，县的信用社还能帮助解决资金二十分之一，加上社员个人投资、国家给予少许贷款的支持，资金问题就可以全部解决。
    中共安国县委指出，生产再跃进的关键还在于领导上提出先进的、明确的增产指标，使群众感到有奔头。早在去年秋后，县委就制订出了粮食比去年提高28.5％，棉花提高60％的跃进计划，并且先后召集两次有两千多人参加的乡社干部会，结合评奖进行宣传布置，同时在各乡、社展开生产再跃进的辩论，帮助干部和群众克服右倾自满情绪，领导全县干部群众继续前进。
    现在安国县的群众生产情绪高涨，每天投入冬季生产的男女劳动力达十一万八千多人。进入安国县境，到处可以看到胜于争秋夺麦的繁忙景象。
