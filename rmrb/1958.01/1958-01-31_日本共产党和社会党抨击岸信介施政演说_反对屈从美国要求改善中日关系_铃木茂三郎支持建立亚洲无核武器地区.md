Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The heads of the Nobusuke Kishi government delivered policy speeches to the Diet on the 29th. Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama continued to emphasize Japanese-US "cooperation" in their speeches. At the same time, they also expressed their support for holding an East-West summit meeting. Kishi and Fujiyama reiterated that the three principles of Japan's foreign policy are: centering on the United Nations, seeking cooperation with "free countries," and adhering to its position as an Asian country. Kishi emphasized that in the current East-West tense situation, Asia has an important position and role unprecedented in Asian history. However, he also provocatively said that nationalist movements united under the banner of anti-colonialism are "often easily exploited by international communist propaganda."

    Speaking of Japan's relations with the United States, Kishi said that Japan is prepared to "consistently maintain a cooperative relationship" in the spirit of the joint declaration he and Eisenhower issued last summer.

    Fujiyama Aiichiro said in his speech that the Japanese government is not considering the issue of recognizing the Chinese government at present, but it is necessary to expand trade with China. Therefore, the Japanese government has been taking necessary measures to relax the embargo on China in accordance with the policy of cooperating with "free countries," and intends to take "necessary and appropriate" measures in the future.

    The policy speeches of the heads of the Kishi government have generally been met with dissatisfaction from progressive forces and public opinion in Japan.

    The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 29th, condemning Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's policy speech in the Diet. The statement emphasized that the Kishi government not only ignores but also violates the interests of the Japanese people. Kishi made no mention at all of restoring diplomatic relations with China.

    The statement said that in terms of domestic affairs, the Kishi government also puts the interests of monopoly capital first and implements anti-people policies. The Japanese Communist Party calls on the Japanese people to launch a movement demanding the resignation of the Kishi government, the dissolution of the Diet, and the holding of Diet elections.

    Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, questioned Kishi's policy speech at a plenary session of the House of Representatives on the afternoon of the 29th. Suzuki said that the Japanese people are very worried that the Kishi government will secretly allow the United States to transport missiles into the country without the people's knowledge, turning Japan into a missile base. Suzuki demanded that the Kishi government change this foreign policy and actively cooperate with peace-loving countries to ease international tensions and ensure Japan's security.

    Suzuki supported holding an East-West summit. He also advocated: 1. Japan should automatically declare that it will not equip, produce, or store nuclear weapons; 2. Prevent the United States from transporting nuclear weapons and missiles into the country and setting up missile bases; 3. Negotiate with relevant countries to conclude an agreement on establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Northwest Pacific region; 4. Hope that Asian countries will actively work to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia; 5. Japan should strive to conclude individual or collective non-aggression treaties with relevant countries such as China, the Soviet Union, and the United States, in order to ultimately ensure peace in Asia.

    Speaking of Sino-Japanese relations, Suzuki advocated that the government must express a positive attitude towards concluding the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement and establishing commercial representative offices in each other's countries, and further conduct contacts with the Chinese government by government agencies or government representatives to discuss various issues between China and Japan.

    Suzuki also called for the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations.

    Asanuma Inajiro, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, also issued a statement on the 29th, criticizing Kishi's policy speech as abstract, lacking concrete content, and playing deceptive tricks.

    日本共产党和社会党抨击岸信介施政演说
    反对屈从美国要求改善中日关系
    铃木茂三郎支持建立亚洲无核武器地区
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：岸信介政府的首脑29日向国会作施政演说。首相岸信介和外务相藤山爱一郎在他们的演说中继续强调日美“合作”，同时，他们也表示赞成召开东西方最高级会议。岸信介和藤山爱一郎重申日本外交政策的三原则是：以联合国为中心，设法同“自由国家”合作，坚持作为一个亚洲国家的立场。岸信介强调，在当前的东西方紧张的局势下，亚洲已经具有亚洲历史上前所未有的重要的地位和作用。但是，他又挑拨地说，团结在反殖民主义旗帜下的民族主义运动，“往往容易被国际共产主义的宣传所利用”。
    在谈到日本同美国的关系时，岸信介说，日本准备本着他和艾森豪威尔去年夏天发表的联合宣言的精神“始终一贯地保持合作关系”。
    藤山爱一郎在他的演说中说，日本政府并不考虑现在承认中国政府的问题，但是，有必要同中国扩大贸易。他说，因此，日本政府一直按照同“自由国家”合作的方针，采取了放宽对中国的禁运所必要的措施，今后也打算采取“必要而适当”的措施。
    岸信介政府首脑的施政演说发表后，日本进步力量和公众舆论普遍表示不满。
    日本共产党中央委员会常任干部会29日发表声明，谴责日本首相岸信介在国会中发表的施政演说。声明强调指出，岸信介政府不仅忽视而且违背日本人民的利益。岸信介完全没有谈到同中国恢复外交关系的问题。
    声明说，在内政问题方面，岸信介政府也是把垄断资本的利益放在第一位，执行反人民的政策。日本共产党号召日本人民展开要求岸信介政府辞职、解散国会和举行国会选举的运动。
    日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎29日下午在众议院全体会议上针对岸信介的施政演说提出质问。铃木说，日本人民非常担心岸信介政府会在人民不知不觉之间暗地里让美国运进导弹，使日本变成导弹基地。铃木要求岸信介政府改变这种外交政策，积极同爱好和平的国家密切合作，以缓和国际紧张局势和保障日本的安全。
    铃木支持举行东西方首脑会谈。他还主张一、日本自动地宣布不装备、不生产和不贮藏核武器；二、阻止美国运进核武器、导弹和设置导弹基地；三、同有关各国商谈缔结西北太平洋地区设立非核武器地区的协定；四、希望亚洲各国积极努力在亚洲设置无核武器地带；五、日本要努力同中、苏、美等有关国家缔结个别的或者集体的互不侵犯条约，以期最后确保亚洲和平。
    铃木在谈到日中关系的时候主张，政府必须对缔结第四次日中贸易协定和互设通商代表机构问题表示积极态度，并且进一步由政府机关或政府代表同中国政府进行接触，商谈日中两国间的各项问题。
    铃木还要求恢复中国在联合国的席位。
    社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎29日也发表谈话，批评岸信介的施政演说是抽象的，缺乏具体的东西，并且玩弄骗人的手法。
