    The "Four Diligences and Eight Haves" in Liling County
    Chen Jun, Deputy Secretary of the Liling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    Liling County, Hunan Province, is a red soil area with undulating hills and numerous paddy fields. The soil is relatively barren, with clay, heavy clay, and heavy sandy soil accounting for more than two-thirds. The county is basically a double-cropping rice area, with double-cropping rice expanding to 92% of the total paddy field area. Rice production has been increasing year by year. The highest yield before liberation was only about 500 jin per mu on average. In 1957, it had increased to an average of 760 jin per mu, an increase of 52% compared to before liberation. The increase in fertilizer application and the rational use of fertilizer played an important role in increasing production, in addition to other factors. In 1956, the average fertilizer application per mu in the county was 223 dan. In 1957, the average fertilizer application was 250 dan per mu. Some agricultural cooperatives applied even more fertilizer, and their yields increased even more. For example, the Xinlian Cooperative applied 220 dan of fertilizer per mu in 1955, with an average yield of 935.5 jin per mu; in 1956, it applied 310 dan of fertilizer per mu, with a yield of 1,013 jin per mu; in 1957, it applied 350 dan of fertilizer per mu, with a yield of 1,040 jin per mu.

    The fertilizer used in Liling County's farmland is mainly farm manure, which is collected and produced locally by farmers. There are many ways to accumulate fertilizer, and farmers have summarized these methods as "Four Diligences and Eight Haves."

      What are the Four Diligences?

    First, diligent sweeping. Sweep floor ash, stove ash, and dust ash at any time, sweep indoor and outdoor garbage, husks, and ashes, and sweep dead grass and fallen leaves from the mountains. After sweeping, store them separately or pour them into ponds to ferment pond manure.

    Second, diligent padding. Mainly padding cattle pens, pigsties, and chicken and duck coops. This can greatly increase the amount of fertilizer accumulated. Most of the rice straw from farmers' two seasons is used to feed cattle and pad cattle pens. It's cold in winter, so rice straw is relied on for padding, 20 to 30 jin per day. In the warm climate of summer and autumn, green grass can be cut, 70 to 80 jin or more than 100 jin per day, and fine soil can also be added to pad with the grass. In this way, a water buffalo can accumulate more than 300 dan of cattle pen manure per year, a yellow cow can accumulate about 180 dan of cattle pen manure, a pig can accumulate 50 to 80 dan of manure, and chicken and duck coops are padded with coal ash or broken dry soil. If the padding is done well, one or twenty chickens and ducks can accumulate more than ten dan of chicken and duck manure ash per year.

    Third, diligent removing. Remove cattle pen manure, remove pigsty manure, and remove chicken coop manure. Cattle pen manure is removed from the pen one or two times a month in cold weather and two or three times a month in hot weather. Pig manure can be removed once a day. Chicken and duck manure is removed about once a month. The scraped cattle manure and chicken and duck manure are generally stored in ash houses, while pig manure is swept into manure pits. This can increase the amount of fertilizer and improve fertilizer efficiency through long-term accumulation.

    Fourth, diligent burning. Burn lime and burn fire soil ash. Lime can be used for all the hilly fields in Liling. Generally, 100 to 150 jin can be applied per mu, with a total annual requirement of about 700,000 to 800,000 jin. Most of the lime is burned and used by farmers themselves. Fire soil ash is an important source for making base fertilizer and can also be used as fertilizer for dry land crops, so the demand is very large. Each mu of land requires ash application three to five times (two or three times for early rice and one or two times for late rice). Therefore, farmers make use of the slack season to collect a large amount of sod in areas where soil and water conservation is not hindered; they collect weeds, fallen leaves, garbage, etc. in open wilderness, mountains, forests, and around residences to burn fire soil ash. After it is made, it is stored in the ash house to prevent the loss of fertilizer efficiency.

      What are the Eight Haves?

    First, cattle have pens. Cattle pen manure can make rice seedlings have yellow silk and bright stalks, and the grains are full. The county generally pays attention to accumulating cattle pen manure, not only ensuring that there is a pen for every cow, but also paying great attention to the construction of the cattle pen. In addition to decorating and building sheds to protect the comfort and health of the cattle, the bottom of the cattle pen is generally dug one or two feet deep, the bottom is compacted, and the edges are solidified to prevent fertilizer leakage. In addition to grazing and plowing, cattle are often kept in cattle pens to trample manure and grass. When it is trampled wet, it is padded, and when it is full, it is removed. Most of the cattle pen manure and grass that is removed is piled up in the ash house and fermented to make base fertilizer, and some is directly carried to the fields to ferment pond manure.

    Second, pigs have sties. There is a saying in Liling: "Raising pigs earns cash, and also fertilizes the fields with manure." Because farmers pay attention to raising pigs and accumulating manure, they also pay attention to the construction of pigsties. Pigsties are mostly built with rammed earth and fire bricks to prevent fertilizer leakage. The surroundings of the fence are whitewashed with lime to prevent swine fever. A manure pit is generally built next to the pigsty with rammed earth, and the bottom of the pigsty is slightly inclined so that pig manure can flow into the manure pit. Depending on the season and temperature, different amounts of rice straw are placed in the pen for pigs to keep warm and trample manure. In this way, each pig can produce 50 to 80 dan of manure per year.

    Third, ash has houses. Liling farmers have a saying: "Don't ask about farming, rely on ash and manure." Farmers throughout the county not only value accumulating manure, but also value accumulating ash, so they pay attention to the construction and arrangement of ash houses. Ash houses are generally located with manure pits to facilitate the making of base fertilizer.

    Fourth, manure has pits. Manure pits are generally built next to pigsties and are made of rammed earth. Each pit can store dozens to more than a hundred dan of manure and urine. Generally, manure pits have lids to prevent leakage and rain washing. Manure and urine preserved in this way have a higher fertilizer efficiency.

    Fifth, people have toilets. In rural Liling, every household has a toilet. Households with few people use manure vats, and households with more people use rammed earth manure pits. Both large and small amounts of urine and feces are collected in manure vats or pits. Generally, manure vats and pits have lids to avoid leakage and reduce losses.

    Sixth, chickens and ducks have coops. Farmers who raise chickens and ducks have coops. They are released during the day and kept in the coops at night. The coops are padded with ash or coal ash to prevent moisture. In this way, chicken and duck droppings are preserved, and a small amount accumulates into a large amount.

    Seventh, all seasons have manure ponds. Fermenting pond manure is a major method of accumulating fertilizer in Liling. The fermentation methods vary from place to place and from time to time, and there are many different types. In terms of location, there are household manure ponds, paddy field ponds, and grassland ponds; in terms of time, there are winter ponds, spring ponds, and summer ponds. Anything that is unused but contains fertilizer efficiency can be collected and fermented into pond fertilizer at any time and anywhere.

    Paddy field ponds are fermented in winter paddy fields and are also called "star ponds." The ponds are mostly circular, with three to five per mu, and each can produce 30 dan of fertilizer. The materials for fermenting the ponds are mainly rice stubble, sod, fallen leaves, pig and cattle pen manure, and household manure. Those fermented in the winter of the previous year are called winter ponds, and those fermented in the spring are called spring ponds. Winter ponds are fermented for a long time, decompose better, and are of better quality than spring ponds.

    Pay attention to the following when fermenting paddy field ponds: First, the pond ridges should be made high to prevent the fertilizer in the pond from being washed away by the water in the field; second, they should be turned frequently and thoroughly so that the pond fertilizer decomposes well; third, the sod and rice stubble should be selected fully, not only to provide sufficient fertilizer but also to facilitate drainage before removing the pond manure; fourth, the pond manure should be removed thoroughly and spread evenly to avoid uneven growth of rice seedlings.

    Grassland ponds are dug on the edges of grassland fields and are generally rectangular, so they are also called "gantry ponds." General grassland fields can be fermented, especially those where the green manure seedlings are not expected to grow well or those reserved for seed. Grassland ponds need to be fermented in winter and spring. The materials and methods for fermentation are roughly the same as those for paddy field ponds, but attention should be paid to frequent turning.

    Hot water ponds, also called "summer ponds," are a type of paddy field pond used to ferment late rice fertilizer. Generally, they are made on the edge or corner of the field around the Grain in Ear solar term. First, the rice stubble and mud from the area where the pond will be made are moved to the nearby rice rows. Then, ridges are built around the pond, and green grass, cattle manure, pig manure, etc. are put into the pond for fermentation. When fermenting summer ponds, there is a lot of green grass and the weather is hot, making it easy to decompose. Generally, it is combined with the second weeding of late rice and applied between the rows of late rice. If it is used for continuous cropping of late rice, it is spread evenly in the field after the early rice is harvested and plowed into the mud.

    Household manure ponds, also called "ditch manure ponds," are fermented in front of and behind the houses. Generally, each pond can produce ten dan of manure each time. All kinds of sod, fallen leaves, vegetable leaves, garbage ground ash, and various sewage are materials for fermenting the ponds. Regardless of the season or amount, they are poured into the pond at any time and turned every 20 days. This manure is removed four or five times a year and is called "household manure," which is a better type of pond fertilizer. Household manure can be applied directly to paddy fields or added to various ponds as "mother fertilizer," which promotes the rapid fermentation and decomposition of other pond manures.

    Eighth, fields have green manure (green fertilizer). To grow double-cropping rice well, green manure must be planted as fertilizer. Now, whether it is depression fields, ridge fields, sandy soil, or clay soil, grass seeds are mostly planted throughout the county. The area is constantly expanding. Out of 670,000 mu of paddy fields in the county, only 258,000 mu were sown in the autumn of 1952, expanding to 410,000 mu in the autumn of 1956, and further expanding to 450,000 mu in the autumn of 1957. Together with 60,000 mu of field rapeseed, a total of more than 510,000 mu were sown, accounting for 76.3% of the total paddy field area. The average yield of green grass per mu is 1,500 to 2,500 jin, and the highest yield reaches 8,000 to 9,000 jin. Because green manure seeds are widely planted and have a high yield, the yield of double-cropping rice is also higher, generally 800 to 900 jin per mu, and high yields reach 1,600 to 1,700 jin. This shows that green manure seeds play a major role in maintaining and improving the fertility of paddy field soil, and they also have two major advantages: high fertilizer efficiency and low cost.

    When planting green manure seeds in double-cropping rice fields, we also paid attention to two points: First, planting plate field grass seeds, that is, sowing in the rows of late rice before the late rice is harvested. The advantage is that it can resolve the contradiction between the green manure sowing season and the late rice harvest period, so that the grass seeds can be sown in a timely manner. Second, planting and selecting early-maturing red flower grass seeds, because red flower grass seeds can be plowed over around the Qingming Festival, which can solve the problem of plowing the field early and transplanting rice seedlings in the spring, without affecting the grass seed yield or hindering the early rice transplanting season. Our experience in planting green manure (grass seeds) in double-cropping rice fields is:

    • Sowing in a timely manner. Generally, sowing is carried out around the Autumn Equinox when the late rice is budding and spreading seeds. Sowing at this time, the field drainage will not affect the growth of late rice, and the rice plants will not fall down, making it easy to go down to the field for sowing. If you wait until after the late rice harvest to sow, it will be delayed until after the Frost's Descent, and the new seedlings are easily frostbitten. If it is sown too early, the field management work of late rice has not been completed, especially if the field cannot be drained, the grass seeds will not grow well. Before sowing, moisten the seeds with clean water. After the seeds swell, sow them. This will allow the seeds to germinate quickly and grow uniformly. However, in dry years or in fields that are prone to water shortages, dry seeds should be sown to prevent the seeds from being ruined by the drought. The method of sowing depends on the situation. For fertile fields where grass seeds are planted for the first time, generally use broadcasting, broadcasting horizontally and vertically once each, so that the seeds are sown evenly; for barren fields or newly planted grass seed fields, generally use spot sowing, that is, first mix the grass seeds evenly with ash manure, bone meal, or soil manure, and then plant them next to the late rice or between the rows for better growth. You can also select some of the soil from the old grass seed fields and store it in the newly planted grass seed fields to increase the grass seed rhizobium. Sowing should be selected on sunny afternoons or cloudy days, and should not be sown on rainy days or when there is dew, otherwise the rice leaves will stick to the seeds and they will not fall into the mud.

    • Increase the amount of sowing. This is an effective measure to increase the yield of grass seeds per unit area. Generally, use two to three jin of seeds per mu, and in barren fields and newly planted fields, increase to four to five jin.

    • Ditch and drain. There is a saying in Liling: "There is no trick to planting good grass seeds, as long as the drainage is done well." Doing a good job of drainage is the main key to planting good green manure seeds in plate fields. The drainage work is divided into two steps. The first step is drainage before sowing. In fields with deep mud and unsmooth water, pay attention to draining the water before the late rice ripens, open ditches around the field, and then irrigate with shallow water before sowing to slightly moisten it. In sandy fields and bank fields that are easy to drain, just drain a few days before sowing, and you can sow when the mud skin is slightly hardened. The second step of drainage is after the late rice is harvested. No matter what the soil of the grass seed field is, you must open the drainage ditches again. Use a cow to plow a circle around the field, and plow a ditch every ten or more zhang in the middle of the field. Always open the outlets to prevent rainwater from staying in the field and keep the field mud dry.

    • Fertilize to promote seedling growth. To make the grass seeds grow well, you must fertilize to promote seedling growth. For newly planted green manure grass seed fields and fields where the grass seeds grow poorly, generally use 10 to 20 dan of thatch or pig and cattle pen manure per mu when weeding the late rice for the second time, spreading it between the rows of late rice and treading it into the mud, which can be used as the base fertilizer for grass seeds and provide the nutrients needed for late rice; in winter, apply another ten dan of cattle pen manure, plant ash, and fire soil ash to loosen the soil and protect the seedlings. Between "Rain Water" and "Awakening of Insects," choose a sunny day to topdress with three to five dan of human or pig manure urine or four to five jin of ammonium sulfate per mu. This can greatly increase the green grass yield.

    • Plow and turn at the right time. Generally, it is appropriate to plow and turn around the Qingming Festival when the three or four layers of flowers are fully opened and the bottom layer is just bearing tender pods. Farmers say, "Too tender is a handful of water, too old is a handful of residue." Therefore, you must seize the plowing season and be sure to complete the plowing within seven days.

    In addition, when planting grass seeds in double-cropping rice fields, you should also pay attention to seedling protection work. First of all, you should pay attention to removing the rice straw as soon as possible after the late rice is harvested to avoid the rice straw crushing the grass seed seedlings; when harvesting the rice, the steps should be light and quick to avoid excessive trampling of the grass seedlings. Secondly, prevent chickens, ducks, and livestock from trampling and eating the grass seed seedlings. These are necessary measures to ensure the increase in grass seed production.

    In order to meet the fertilizer needs of double-cropping rice growth, in addition to mobilizing farmers to do a good job of "Four Diligences and Eight Haves" for regular fertilizer accumulation and conservation, a concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaign (month, week, or bi-weekly) is also carried out every year. The fertilizer accumulation target is proposed from top to bottom, and all farmers are mobilized to accumulate fertilizer. In winter and spring, combined with pest control "Three Lights," use fallen leaves, weeds, rice stubble, etc. to burn a large amount of fire soil ash, and at the same time, combined with winter water conservancy construction, a large amount of pond mud and dam mud are collected. Before the summer harvest of early rice, use the weeds and sod that are shoveled down from the roadside, field edge, and flat slope to ferment summer ponds as the base fertilizer for late rice. After the summer harvest, use rice straw to exchange for thatch from thatched roofs. After collectivization, brick soil is also used as fertilizer in large quantities. Generally, new bricks are made after autumn, and Chen bricks are replaced during the slack season, crushed, sieved, and stored properly. After transplanting, they are mixed with cattle manure ash, etc. and used as base fertilizer raw materials, and can also be used as topdressing when weeding the fields. At the same time, stove soil, surface mud, and old vegetable soil are also used as fertilizer to ensure the needs of double-cropping rice production increase.

    醴陵县的“四勤八有”
    中共醴陵县委副书记　陈军
    湖南省醴陵是个红壤地区，全县丘陵起伏，山冲田多，土质比较贫瘠，粘土、重粘土和重沙土占了三分之二以上。全县基本上是双季稻地区，双季稻已扩大到全县稻田总面积的92％，稻谷产量逐年提高。解放前的最高产量每亩平均只有五百斤左右，1957年已提高到每亩平均七百六十斤，比解放前增产了52％。其所以能提高产量，除其他条件外，施肥量的增加和肥料的合理使用，起了重要作用。1956年全县平均每亩施肥二百二十三担，1957年平均每亩施肥二百五十担。个别农业社施肥量更多，而产量也提高得更多，如新联社1955年每亩施肥二百二十担，每亩平均产量九百三十五斤半；1956年每亩施肥三百一十担，每亩产量一千零十三斤；1957年每亩施肥三百五十担，每亩产量一千零四十斤。
    醴陵县农田用肥主要是农家肥料，这些肥料都由农民就地取材就地积制。积肥的办法很多，农民把这些办法归结为“四勤八有”。
      什么是四勤？
    一是勤扫。随时扫地灰、灶灰、扬尘灰，扫室内外的垃圾、谷壳、灰屑，扫山上的枯草落叶。扫来以后，分别的贮藏起来，或者倾入凼中沤制凼粪。
    二是勤垫。主要是垫牛栏、猪圈、鸡鸭埘，这样就能大量的增加积肥数量。农民一年两季稻草绝大部分用来喂牛垫牛栏。冬天冷，全靠稻草垫，每天垫二十至三十斤；夏秋两季气候温和，可以割青草，每天垫七、八十斤至百多斤，还可以加细土与草一起垫。这样一头水牛每年可以积得三百多担牛栏粪，一头黄牛可积得一百八十担左右的牛栏粪，一头猪可积五十担至八十担粪，鸡鸭埘内用煤灰或碎干土垫，垫得好的，一、二十鸡鸭每年就可以积十几担鸡鸭粪灰。
    三是勤出。出牛栏粪，出猪栏粪，出鸡塒粪。牛栏粪冷天每月出栏一、二次，热天每月出栏二、三次。猪粪可每天出一次。鸡鸭粪约一月出一次。括出来的牛粪，鸡鸭粪一般贮存灰屋内，猪粪则扫入粪池内。这样长年积累，可以增加肥料数量和提高肥效。
    四是勤烧。烧石灰、烧火土灰。醴陵丘丘田可用石灰，一般每亩可施一百斤至一百五十斤，全年共约需用七、八十万斤。石灰多由农民自烧自用。火土灰是制安蔸灰的重要来源，也可以做旱地作物的肥料，需要量很大，每亩田插灰三至五次（早稻二、三次，晚稻一、二次）。因此农民都利用农闲在不妨碍水土保持的地区大量铲集草皮；在圹野山林中宅院旁收集杂草、落叶、垃圾等烧制火土灰，制好即挑灰屋里贮藏，以防肥效流失。
      什么叫八有？
    一是牛有栏。牛栏粪下田可使禾苗黄丝亮杆，谷粒饱满。全县普遍讲究积牛栏粪，不仅做到有牛必有栏，而且对牛栏的修建非常注意，除了装修搭盖保护耕牛舒适、健康外，一般还要把牛栏底挖一、二尺深，将底子捶紧，边缘砌实，以防肥分渗漏。牛除放牧与耕田之外，经常关在牛栏内踩粪草，踩湿了就垫，垫满了就出。取出的牛栏粪草多数放在灰屋里堆集，腐熟做安蔸灰，也有直接挑到田里沤凼粪。
    二是猪有圈。醴陵有句俗话：“养猪赚趸钱，又有粪肥田。”农民因为注意养猪积肥，所以也讲究猪圈的修建。猪圈多用三合土、火砖砌底，不使肥份渗漏。栏的周围用石灰刷白，防止猪瘟。猪圈旁边一般用三合土修成粪池，猪圈底面稍为倾斜，猪粪可以流入粪池。视季节冷热，在栏内放不同数量的稻草，以供猪御寒和踩粪。这样，每头猪全年可产粪五十——八十担。
    三是灰有屋。醴陵农谚：“作田不要问，全靠灰和粪。”全县农民不仅重视积粪，同时也非常重视积灰，所以都很注意灰屋的建筑安排。灰屋一般的与粪池在一起，便于制安蔸灰。
    四是粪有池。粪池一般建筑在猪圈的旁边，用三合土筑成。每个池子可贮几十担到百多担粪尿。一般粪池都有盖，做到下不渗漏，上下淋洗。这样保存的粪尿肥效比较高。
    五是人有厕所。醴陵农村中户户有厕所，人口少的户用粪缸，人口多的用三合土粪池，大小便都归到粪缸或粪池里。一般粪缸、池都有盖，避免了渗漏，减少了损失。
    六是鸡鸭有埘。农民养鸡鸭都设有埘。白天放养，晚上关在埘里。埘里垫入灰或煤炭灰，以免潮湿。这样来保存鸡鸭的粪便，积少成多。
    七是四季有粪凼。沤制凼粪是醴陵积肥的一种主要办法。沤制的办法，因地因时不同，多式多样。就地点说有家粪凼、水田凼、草田凼；就时间说，有冬凼、春凼、伏凼。凡是没有用而含有肥效的东西，都能随时随地收集起来沤制凼肥。
    水田凼沤在冬水田里又叫“星子凼”。凼子多为圆形，每亩作三——五个，每个可出肥料三十担。沤凼的材料，主要是禾蔸、草皮、落叶、猪牛栏粪、家粪。在先年冬季沤的叫冬凼，春季沤的叫春凼，冬凼沤的时间长，沤得烂，质量比春凼好。
    沤制水田凼要注意几点：第一凼埂要做得高，免得凼内肥分被田里的水冲失；第二，要翻得勤，翻得彻底，使凼肥腐熟得好；第三，草皮禾蔸要挑得满，不但肥料足也便出凼前排水；第四，凼肥要出得彻底，撒得均匀，以免禾苗生长得不整齐。
    草田凼挖在草子田的田边上，一般是长方形，所以又叫“门架子凼”。一般的草子田都可沤，特别是估计绿肥草子生长不会好或是草子留种田就更需要沤草田凼，冬春季都可沤。沤的材料和方法大致和水田凼相同，但要注意翻得勤。
    热水凼又叫“伏凼”，是沤制晚稻凼肥的一种水田凼。一般在芒种节前后做在田边或田角上，先把要做凼的地方的禾蔸连泥移到附近禾行子里，然后周围作埂，把青草、牛粪、猪粪等放入凼内沤制。沤伏凼时，青草多天气热，容易腐熟。一般结合间作晚稻踩第二道禾施放在晚稻行间。如用在连作晚稻，则在早稻收割后，均匀撒在田间，打入泥中。
    家粪凼又叫“沟粪凼”，沤在屋门前后。一般的凼每凼每次可出粪十担。凡是草皮、落叶、菜叶、垃圾地灰和各种污水都是沤凼的材料，不分季节，不论多少，随时倾入凼内，每隔二十天翻动一次，每年可出粪四、五次，叫做“家粪”，是凼肥中较好的一种。家粪有直接施到稻田的，也有加到各种凼中作“娘子粪”的，它有促进其它凼粪迅速腐熟分解的效能。
    八是田里有草子（绿肥）。要作好双季稻，必须种草子做肥料。现在全县不论冲田、垅田、沙土或粘土，大都种上草子。面积不断地扩大，全县有六十七万亩稻田，1952年秋只播种二十五万八千亩，1956年秋扩大到四十一万亩，1957年秋再扩大到四十五万亩，加上六万亩田油菜，共播种五十一万多亩，占总稻田面积76.3％。每亩平均产青草一千五百斤到二千五百斤，最高产量达到八、九千斤。由于绿肥草子种得广，产量较高，因而双季稻的产量也较高，一般每亩产量八、九百斤，高的达到一千六七百斤。这就说明绿肥草子对维持和增进稻田土壤肥力，起了主要作用，而且它还有肥效高、成本低两大好处。
    在双季稻田种绿肥草子，我们还注意了两点：第一，种板田草子，即在晚稻收获前，在晚稻行子里播种。它的好处是可以解决草子播种季节与晚稻收获期间的矛盾，使草子能适时播种。第二，种选用成熟早的红花草子，因为红花草子可以在清明季节前后犁翻，可以解决春季早犁田早插秧的问题，既不影响草子产量，又不妨碍早稻插秧季节。种绿肥（草子）的经验在双季稻田里种绿肥草子，我们的经验是：
    ?适时播种。一般在秋分前后正当晚稻勾头散籽时播种。这时播种，田间排水不会影响晚稻生长，稻株也未倒伏便于下田播种。如果等到晚稻收割后才播种，就会延迟到霜降以后，新生幼苗容易遭受霜害。如果播种得太早了，晚稻田间管理工作还未完结，特别是田里不能排水，草子就生长不好。在播种前，把种子用清水拌湿，待种子泡发后再播，这样可使种子发芽迅速，生长整齐。但在干旱年岁或容易缺水的田里就要播干籽，以防炕坏种子。播种的方法看情况而定，原种草子的肥田，一般采用撒播、横直撒播各一次，使种子播得均匀；瘦田或新种草子田一般用点播，即先把草子种与灰粪、骨粉或土粪混合均匀，然后一蔸蔸点在晚稻蔸子旁边或禾行中间，生长较好。也可以把老种草子田里的泥土挑一些存在新种草子田里，增加草子根瘤菌。播种要选择晴天的下午或阴天为好，落雨天和有露水时不能播种，否则禾叶粘住种子，落不下泥。
    ?增加播种量。这是提高单位面积草子产量的有效措施。一般每亩用种二、三斤，在瘦田与新种田地中还要加多到四、五斤。
    ?开沟排水。醴陵有句农谚：“种好草子没有巧，只要排水做得好。”做好排水工作，是板田种好绿肥草子的主要关键。排水工作分为两个步骤，第一步是播种前的排水，在泥脚深不爽水的田，在晚稻园脚前就注意把水排干，在田周围开沟，播种前再灌浅水，稍微润湿。容易排水的砂性田和岸田，就只要在播前几天排水，略硬一下泥皮就可播种。第二步排水是在晚稻收割以后，不论草子田是什么泥土都要再一次开好排水沟，用牛在田的周围犁一圈，并在田中间每隔一丈多远犁一条沟，经常开出水口，不让雨水停留田间，保持田泥干爽。
    ?施肥催苗。要让草子长得好必须施肥催苗。新种绿肥草子的田和草子长得差的田，一般结合晚稻踩二道田时每亩用一、二十担屋茅杆或猪牛栏粪，撒在晚稻行间踩入泥中，既可作草子的基肥，又供给晚稻所需的营养分；到冬天再施十来担牛栏粪，草木灰、火土灰，以松土护苗。在“雨水”到“惊蛰”间选择晴天每亩追施人、猪粪尿三、五担或硫酸氨四、五斤，这样可以大大提高青草产量。
    ?适时犁翻。一般在清明前后开满了三、四盘花最下层刚结嫩荚时犁翻为恰当。农民说“过嫩一蒲水，过老一把渣。”因此必须抓住犁田季节，要在七天一定犁完。
    此外在双季稻田种草子还要注意保苗工作。首先应注意晚稻收割后把稻草尽快挑出，避免稻草压死草子幼苗；在割禾时脚步宜轻快，以免过多的踩死草苗，其次防止鸡鸭牲畜践食草子幼苗，这都是确保草子增产的必要措施。
    为了满足双季稻生长的肥料需要，除发动农民作好“四勤八有”的经常性的积肥保肥外，每年还开展了突击性的积肥运动（月或周或双周），由上而下的提出施肥积肥指标，发动全体农民积肥。冬春二季，结合治虫“三光”，利用落叶杂草禾蔸等，烧制大量火土灰，同时结合冬修水利，大量的挑塘泥，坝泥。夏季早稻收割前，利用路边、田边、平坡地铲下的杂草，草皮沤制夏凼，以作晚稻基肥，夏收后利用稻草换下茅屋的屋茅杆。合作化后，还大量利用陈砖土作肥料，一般在秋后做好新砖，趁农闲将陈砖换下，捶碎过筛妥善贮藏，插秧后与牛粪灰等拌用，作为安蔸灰原料，也可在踩田时作为追肥。同时还利用灶土、地皮泥、老菜土等作为肥料，以保证双季稻增产的需要。
