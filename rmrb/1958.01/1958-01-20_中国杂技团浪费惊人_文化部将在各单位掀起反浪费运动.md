The China Acrobatic Troupe's Waste is Startling
The Ministry of Culture to Launch an Anti-Waste Campaign in All Units

    (Our newspaper reports) During this rectification movement, many staff members of the China Acrobatic Troupe, with agitated hearts, wrote big-character posters exposing the troupe's serious waste. Currently, the rectification leading group of this troupe intends to further mobilize the masses to thoroughly expose all wasteful phenomena. The Ministry of Culture has decided to start with the anti-waste movement of the Acrobatic Troupe and launch an anti-waste movement in all its affiliated units.

	Impractical Training Hall
    Back in 1956, the China Acrobatic Troupe sent people to the Soviet Great Circus to learn programs such as "Aerial Acrobatics" and "Trampoline." After this, the leading cadres of the Acrobatic Troupe decided to build a training hall dedicated to practicing high-altitude and large-scale programs in Shique Hutong, Beixinqiao. However, because the troupe's leadership handed over the construction process to an amateur cadre for a long time, the building, which cost more than 46,000 yuan, could only be used for one trampoline program due to insufficient diameter (it was discovered that the house leaked during the first snowfall of this year). Before building this training hall, the Acrobatic Troupe already knew that this location would be developed into a road in the future. Therefore, another training ground was built in the eastern suburbs, costing more than 30,000 yuan for the steel frame structure alone. However, this building was not as practical as the previous one. Even when practicing trampoline, the ends of the trampoline had to extend outside the house. The orchestra had no space to stand in the house and could not cooperate with the performers. A training ground for animals was built in the eastern suburbs, along with its auxiliary buildings, costing more than 100,000 yuan in total. Before building this animal training ground, the Acrobatic Troupe only sent a cadre to the Western Suburbs Zoo to imitate and draw a sketch of the animal housing, and then the Ministry of Culture's construction engineering team started construction. As a result, everything was substandard: the animal housing was not facing the sun, the quality was very poor, and a horse knocked down the wall with its backside when it turned around. People are very worried about how such a training ground can hold lions and tigers.
    The Acrobatic Troupe does not yet have tigers, but enthusiastic people have already arranged cages for them. The cages are made entirely of cast iron and require eight strong men to lift. Because the cages are too bulky, many of the wheels underneath have already broken. At the same time, the cage doors are too small, making it inconvenient for tigers to enter and exit even if they had them. The six animal cages are worth nearly 10,000 yuan.
    The Acrobatic Troupe also has no plan for purchasing props and equipment. Because many of the purchased items are not suitable, they can only be stored in the warehouse for a long time. For example, the troupe specially sent people to Jiangxi to customize forty boxes of props, such as jars, pots, and plates of various sizes, for performances, but none of them could be used because they were not up to standard. For another example, a lot of money was spent on making sixteen curtains, but they were too small for large venues and too large for small venues. For another example, some musical instruments could clearly be bought in Beijing, but the troupe sent someone to Guangdong to buy them, spending a lot of extra travel expenses, and they were still left unused after being bought. For example, more than ten catties of silk and copper strings used on stringed instruments were stored, and these items were also piled up in the warehouse.

	Not a Warehouse, but a Chaotic Storage Area
    How many things are there in the China Acrobatic Troupe's warehouse? No one knows for sure until now. This warehouse was only cleared once back in 1955, and has not been managed since. It was cleaned up again during the recent rectification phase, and it was found that many valuable props and costumes had already been damaged. For example, two brand new velvet blankets worth more than 1,000 yuan were moldy because no one turned them over to air them out. Two large velvet curtains had been bitten all over by insects. One specially made embroidered shoe was still in good condition, but the other had rotted. There was also a lot of white cloth that had turned yellow over the years.
    As for the items lost in the warehouse, there are countless. A bicycle sidecar purchased in England specifically for motorcycle stunt riding disappeared from the warehouse. During the recent warehouse inventory, it was discovered that four new gabardine suit pants were missing and had been replaced with four old pants. After investigation, it was discovered that the four old pants had also been lost earlier. The people who took them now disliked that they were old, so they brought them back and exchanged them for new ones. During the Acrobatic Troupe's overseas performances, they received many gifts from foreign friends. Now some of these items have been moved to private homes, while others have been damaged. The glassware currently stored in the warehouse is not as much as the glassware gifts received during a single trip to Czechoslovakia.
    Within the Acrobatic Troupe, not only is there a troupe-wide warehouse, but each performing team also has its own "small warehouse"; and some actors even have "tiny warehouses." Some people casually take public clothes and wear them, and never return them for a long time. One actor's embroidered shoes worn at home were specially made by the troupe for him when he was acting. After the performance, he took the items for himself. Such things are very common in the Acrobatic Troupe.
    The Acrobatic Troupe's props are not only randomly placed in the warehouse, but also piled up in the corners of the yard and in the corridors. For example, specially made vermilion-painted benches and chairs for training are casually placed and used. The props used for the "High-Altitude Acrobatics" program are left in the yard to be exposed to the wind and rain, and have not been placed in a suitable place for a long time.

	The Fate of Dogs and Horses
    In the Acrobatic Troupe, not only are props and equipment not managed, but some valuable animals have not been properly cared for either. For example, not long ago, the Acrobatic Troupe spent more than 10,000 yuan to buy more than ten dogs from abroad. Now one has died, and another is dazed. In addition, a puppy that had been trained to perform and was very popular with the audience had its leg bitten off by a large dog; and while it was being treated, it was run over by a large car. For another example, a famous actor bought five horses (more than 700 yuan) at a low price, one of which was a thoroughbred. After training, it was able to dance to music and would soon be able to perform. However, while this comrade was performing abroad, someone rode this horse to buy groceries, crippling the horse's leg. When he returned to the troupe, they did not treat the horse, and now the horse is dumb and will no longer perform. The troupe had to spend more than 9,000 yuan to buy four more horses.

	Where is the Key Problem?
    Why is the waste so serious in the Acrobatic Troupe? From the revealed materials, it can be seen that the key lies in the leadership cadres' indifferent attitude towards state property.
    As the heads of the Acrobatic Troupe, the two leaders, one took a "can push, will push", laissez-faire attitude towards everything. There are many problems in the troupe, but he does not actively find ways to solve them. The other leader went to the troupe relatively early, and he only paid attention to business leadership and spent money lavishly. And the two leaders did not pay much attention to the troupe's financial situation. As for what the troupe wanted to build, they only generally approved it and never conducted detailed investigations and research work. This is the root cause of the troupe's serious waste.

    中国杂技团浪费惊人
    文化部将在各单位掀起反浪费运动
    本报讯　在这次整风运动中，中国杂技团的许多工作人员以激愤的心情，纷纷写大字报揭露该团严重的浪费事实。目前，这个团的整风领导小组，打算进一步号召群众把所有的浪费现象彻底揭发出来。文化部决定从杂技团的反浪费运动开始，在所属各单位开展一个反浪费运动。
      不实用的练功厅
    还是在1956年的时候，中国杂技团曾经派人向苏联大马戏团学习“空中飞人”和“蹦蹦床”等节目。在这以后，杂技团的领导干部决定在北新桥石雀胡同内修建一个专门排练高空和大型节目用的练功厅，但是，由于团的领导上在建筑过程中长期交给一个外行干部去安排，结果这个花了四万六千多元的建筑物，因为直径不够，仅能练一个蹦床节目（今年下初雪时，发现房子还漏水）。在盖这一练功厅以前，杂技团已经知道这个地点今后还要开辟成马路。因此又在东郊盖起另一个练功场，仅铁架结构就花了三万多元。可是盖起的这个建筑物，还不如前一个实用价值高，即使练蹦床的话，蹦床的两头还必须伸展到屋子外边。乐队在房子里没有落脚之地，无法和演员配合。在东郊建筑的一个训兽场，加上它的附属建筑，共花去十万多元。在建筑这个训兽场以前，杂技团只派了一个干部到西郊动物园模仿着画了一张养兽房的草图，回来后就由文化部建筑工程队动工盖起来了。结果全部不合规格：兽房盖得不朝阳，质量很差，马一调转屁股就把墙弄倒了。人们很担心这样的训兽场怎能圈进狮子、老虎。
    杂技团现在还没有老虎，可是热心的人早已为老虎安排下了兽笼。兽笼完全是用生铁做成的，要八个壮汉才能抬得动。由于笼子太笨重，下面轱辘已经压断了很多。同时笼门太小，即使有了老虎，出入也很不方便。六个兽笼价值将近万元。
    杂技团在添置道具和设备方面也毫无计划，由于添置的许多东西不合用，只能长期堆在仓库里。例如，团里曾专门派人去江西定制的供演出用的缸、坛子、盘子等大小四十多箱道具，因为不合规格，一个也不能用。又如，花了很多钱做了十六块幕布，但是大场子用太小，小场子用又太大。再如，有的乐器明明在北京可以买到，团里却派专人到广东去买，多花许多车费，买来了还是放着不用。像弦乐器上用的丝弦铜弦存了十来斤，这些东西也都堆在仓库里。
    不是仓库、是乱堆场
    中国杂技团的仓库里究竟有多少东西呢？到现在谁也摸不清。这个仓库还是远在1955年清查过一次，以后就一直无人管理。在最近整改阶段又清理了一次，结果发现很多价值昂贵的道具、服装早已破烂不堪了。例如，有两块价值一千多元的全新丝绒大毛毯，由于无人翻晒而霉烂了。有两块大绒幕已被虫子咬得遍体鳞伤。一双特制的绣鞋，一只还很好，另一只已经烂了。还有不少白布已经年久发黄。
    至于仓库里丢失的东西更是数不胜数。在英国买的专供飞车走壁用的自行车外带，放在仓库里就不翼而飞了。这次清查仓库的时候又发现有四条新的戈别丁西服裤不见了，变成四条旧的裤子。经过追查，才发现四条旧裤原来也是早丢失的，现在拿走的人嫌旧了，又拿回来换了新的。杂技团在出国演出期间，收到很多外国朋友送的礼品，现在这些东西有的被搬到了私人家里，有的则损坏了。现在仓库里存放的玻璃器皿，还抵不上去捷克斯洛伐克一次所收到的玻璃器皿礼物那么多。
    在杂技团内，不仅有全团的仓库，各个演员队还有自己的“小仓库”；而有的演员则还有“小小仓库”。有些人随便拿了公家的衣服穿在身上，长期不还。有一个演员在家穿的绣花鞋就是公家在他演戏的时候替他定做的，演完了戏，东西就占为己有了。像这样的事情，在杂技团里是很多的。
    杂技团的道具不仅乱放在仓库里，连院子的墙角、走廊里都堆放着。如专门制作的供练功用的朱红漆板凳、椅子，就随便乱放和使用。“高架飞人”节目用的道具放在院子里任凭风吹雨淋，长期没有安置在一个适当的地方。
      狗和马的遭遇
    在杂技团里，不仅道具和设备无人管理，就是一些名贵的动物也没有得到妥善的照顾。例如，不久以前，杂技团花了一万多元从国外买回十多条狗，现在有一条已经死去，还有一条已经发昏了。另外有一只小狗，已经训练得会表演了，很受观众欢迎，结果竟被大狗咬断了一条腿；而正在医治的时候，又被大汽车压死了。又如，一位著名演员曾经用低价买回了五匹马（七百多元），其中有一匹是名种，经过训练，已经能够听着音乐跳舞，不久就可以上演了。但是在这个同志出国演出期间，有人竟骑着这匹马出去买菜，把马的腿弄跛了，回来团里又没有为这匹马医治，现在这匹马已经傻了，再也不会表演了。团里只好花九千多元另外买了四匹马。
      关键问题在哪里？
    杂技团的浪费现象为什么会这样严重呢？从揭发出来的材料可以看到，关键在于领导干部对国家财产采取了漠不关心的态度。
    作为杂技团负责人的两位团长，一个是对一切事情采取能推就推、得过且过的工作态度，团里问题很多，但是他不主动设法解决。另一个团长去该团比较早，他只注意业务领导，花起钱来大手大脚。而两个团长对于团里的财政情况，都不大过问，对于团里要建造什么，只是一般地批示，从不进行细致的调查研究工作，这是造成该团严重浪费的根本原因。
