Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 27th: According to a communique issued today by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Soviet Council of Ministers on the implementation of the 1957 National Economic Plan, in 1957, the Soviet Union's pig iron production increased to 37 million tons, steel production increased to 51 million tons, rolled steel increased to 40.2 million tons, coal increased to 463 million tons, oil increased to 98.3 million tons, electricity increased to 209.5 billion kilowatt-hours, and cotton fabrics increased to 5.6 billion meters.

The communique pointed out that the Soviet Union made new achievements in developing animal husbandry last year. At present, the Soviet Union's total milk production has reached approximately 95% of the total milk production of the United States. The output of machine-made oils and fats is almost on par with the United States, and in terms of total oils and fats production (including home-made), the Soviet Union has slightly surpassed the United States.

Industrial Output Value Increased by 10%

The communique said that in 1957, the Soviet Union greatly overfulfilled the annual industrial production tasks. The total industrial output value increased by 10% compared with 1956 (of which, the production of means of production increased by 11%, and the production of consumer goods increased by more than 8%), while the originally planned increase target was 7.1%. All union republics completed the production plans for total industrial output value and most important industrial products ahead of schedule. The production plans of industrial enterprises under the Soviet national economic commissions were fulfilled by more than 104%. In the second half of last year, after the reorganization of industrial management, the plan was completed more smoothly than in the same period of the previous year.

Compared with 1956, the output of important industrial products in the Soviet Union increased in 1957, of which the output of pig iron increased by 4%, steel increased by 5%, rolled steel increased by 6%, coal increased by 8%, oil increased by 17%, electricity increased by 9%, and cotton fabrics increased by 3%. In the past year, the Soviet Union produced 495,500 cars, 204,000 tractors, 131,000 grain harvesting combines, 31,400 corn harvesting combines, 20.2 billion cubic meters of gas, 282 million meters of woolen fabrics, and 805 million meters of silk fabrics, which increased by 7%, 11%, 60%, 121%, 48%, 5%, and 7% respectively compared with 1956.

When talking about the investment in capital construction, the communique said that in 1957, the total investment in capital construction by Soviet state and cooperative organizations (excluding collective farms) was 210 billion rubles, 12% more than in 1956. Last year, 800 new large industrial enterprises were put into production in the Soviet Union.

At the end of last year, the number of employees in various sectors of the Soviet national economy was 52.1 million, an increase of 2.1 million compared with the end of 1956. As in previous years, there were no unemployed people in the Soviet Union last year.

Scientific and Technological Achievements Climb to World Peak

Regarding the achievements in science, technology, and culture, the communique pointed out that last year the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial earth satellites, created the world's first very powerful intercontinental ballistic missile, manufactured the world's most efficient atomic particle accelerator—the synchrophasotron, and mastered the production of ultra-high-speed jet and turboprop airliners. Many new nuclear power plants (each with a capacity of 200,000 to 400,000 kilowatts) are now under construction. In addition, Soviet machine-building industries, scientific research institutes, and design institutions last year researched and manufactured more than 1,500 important new types of machines, machinery, appliances, and other equipment, and mastered the mass production of more than 350 new machines, equipment, instruments, and materials.

Milk Production and Livestock Numbers Surge

When talking about agricultural production achievements, the communique said that in 1957, the Soviet Union produced 54.7 million tons of milk, an increase of 43% compared with 1954 and 20% compared with 1956. Last year, the average milk yield per cow in collective farms across the country was 1,858 kilograms, and the national procurement volume of milk and dairy products increased by 80% compared with 1954. This means that the targets set by the January 1955 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee for these two aspects to be achieved within six years have been completed within three years.

Last year, the total number of productive livestock in the Soviet Union also increased. Compared with January 1, 1957, the number of large livestock nationwide increased by 5.3 million, pigs increased by 3.5 million, and sheep increased by 12 million.

Although the climatic conditions in many regions of the Soviet Union were not good last year, the total harvest of grain (stock harvest) still increased by 26% compared with 1953. The country now has the necessary amount of grain.

Last year, the technical equipment of Soviet agriculture was further strengthened. Agriculture received a total of 257,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 126,000 trucks, 131,000 grain combine harvesters, and hundreds of thousands of other agricultural machines and implements. The degree of mechanization of field work has been further improved.

National Income Increased by 6%

The communique then said that in 1957, the Soviet Union's national income (calculated at comparable prices) increased by 6% compared with 1956. The state has taken a series of significant measures to improve the people's material welfare. Last year, the government raised the wages of low-paid working people and abolished the taxes they bore. The pensions, social insurance, subsidies for families with many children, student grants, free medical care, and other subsidies received by Soviet residents have greatly increased this year. The average real income of employees increased by 7% throughout the year, and the cash and in-kind income of farmers increased by 5%. Last year, residents across the Soviet Union purchased 75.7 billion rubles more goods than in 1956.

In 1957, the Soviet Union built new housing with a total living area of more than 48 million square meters. In addition, members of collective farms and rural intellectuals built 770,000 new houses for themselves.

Total Number of Students Exceeds 50 Million

Last year, the total number of students in schools at all levels in the Soviet Union was more than 50 million, and the number of college students studying in universities (including correspondence universities) was more than 2 million. More than 770,000 young experts graduated from higher and secondary specialized schools. The number of Soviet scientific workers has increased to 260,000, an increase of almost 9% in the past year.

The communique concluded by saying that in 1957, the Soviet Union's economic ties with foreign countries were further expanded, and the total volume of foreign trade increased by 13%.
