Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: TASS, Moscow, January 16th: A mining team in the Donets coal region, led by Soviet Hero of Socialist Labor, Mamayev, has launched a socialist emulation campaign to mine an extra 1.5 tons of coal per coal miner per day beyond the work shift quota.

	As early as 1956, the Mamayev team decided to have each miner mine one ton of coal per day beyond the work shift quota. The team used this as the basis for the emulation, and last year they over-fulfilled the task by mining an extra four thousand tons of coal. As a result of increased labor productivity, the miners' wages also increased. Members of the team can now earn three thousand to five thousand rubles, or even more, per month.

	After all the miners in the mine where the team is located competed using the Mamayev team's method, they over-fulfilled the plan by nearly fifty thousand tons of coal last year.

	The Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party's resolution praised the Mamayev team's patriotic initiative. The resolution pointed out that the specific method of socialist emulation proposed by the team, which aims to exceed the daily production quota, can be promoted in all industrial and construction sectors of the republic.

    顿?茨一个矿工队的干劲大
    争取每人每天多采一吨半煤
    据新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：苏联社会主义劳动英雄马麦耶领导的在顿?茨煤区的一个矿工工作队发起了争取每个采煤工人每天超过工作班定额多采煤一吨半的社会主义竞赛。
    早在1956年，马麦耶工作队就曾经决定使每个矿工每天采煤量超过工作班定额一吨。这个工作队把这作为竞赛的基础，在去年一年中超过任务多开采了四千吨煤。由于提高了劳动生产率，矿工的工资也增加了。这个工作队的队员现在每月可以拿到三千到五千卢布，或者更多一些。
    这个工作队所在矿井的全体矿工根据马麦耶工作队的方法进行竞赛以后，在去年超过计划开采了将近五万吨煤。
    乌克兰共产党中央委员会的决议赞扬了马麦耶工作队的爱国创举。决议指出，这个工作队所提出的争取超额完成每天生产定额的社会主义竞赛的具体方式，可以在共和国的所有工业和建设部门中推广。
