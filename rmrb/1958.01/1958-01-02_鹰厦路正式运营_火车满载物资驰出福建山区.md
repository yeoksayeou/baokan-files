Xinhua News Agency, Nanping, January 1st. The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway officially began operations today, with all stations along the line starting to handle national railway joint transportation services for passengers and freight units. The first freight train, fully loaded with timber and other construction materials, is speeding out of the Fujian mountains along the Yingxia Line to support the socialist construction of the country's Second Five-Year Plan.

According to the relevant department负责人, the Nanchang Railway Bureau, which is currently responsible for managing this railway, and all railway workers on the Yingxia Line are actively preparing to operate direct passenger trains from Xiamen to Nanchang and from Nanping to Shanghai in the near future.

In 1958, the Yingxia Railway will transport approximately 2.4 million tons of various goods, including means of production and consumer goods, for the country and the Fujian region. This represents an increase of approximately 30% compared to the actual freight volume in 1957 (excluding the transportation of construction materials). Among them, approximately 1.2 million tons of timber are planned to be transported, an increase of nearly 50% compared to 1957.

Since the Yingxia Railway extended into Fujian in the first half of 1956 and the entire line was completed by the end of 1956, the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which was responsible for the construction, conducted new line maintenance and repairs while also handling temporary operations from north to south, section by section, along the entire line. During the more than one year of temporary operations, a comprehensive water and land transportation network with the railway as its backbone has been initially formed within Fujian. Sixty-eight highways and inland waterway steamer routes, totaling 3,587 kilometers in length, have been newly built and opened along both sides of the railway. This has fundamentally changed the backward transportation situation in the mountainous areas of Fujian. A large quantity of timber, Mao bamboo, and other local specialty products from the mountainous areas are continuously transported to the Yingxia Railway line via waterways and highways, and then transported quickly and cheaply to all parts of the country by train. In 1957 alone, more than one million cubic meters of timber were transported by railway to various industrial and mining enterprises and construction bases across the country, equivalent to the total amount of timber transported out of the Fujian forestry area in two or three years before the railway was built. Mao bamboo, which had never been transported out of the area due to transportation difficulties in the past, was transported for the first time last year, with six million bamboo poles being shipped out. Materials needed for industrial and agricultural production and construction in the coastal and mountainous areas of Fujian, supported by other provinces, are also directly transported from Northeast China, Shanghai, and other places to Fujian by train. This has powerfully supported and promoted the rapid development of various production and construction projects in the mountainous and coastal areas of Fujian and increased the economic income of the people in the mountainous areas of Fujian.

### 鹰厦路正式运营  火车满载物资驰出福建山区

    鹰厦路正式运营
    火车满载物资驰出福建山区
    新华社南平1日电　鹰潭—厦门铁路今天开始正式运营，全线各站开始为旅客和货运单位办理全国铁路联运业务。开始正式运营后的第一列满载木材等建设物资的货运列车，正由鹰厦线飞速驰出福建山区，支援国家第二个五年计划的社会主义建设。
    据有关部门负责人说，目前负责管理这条铁路的南昌铁路管理局和鹰厦线全体铁路职工正积极筹备在近日内办理厦门—南昌旅客直达列车和南平—上海直达列车。
    在1958年，鹰厦铁路将为国家和福建地区运输生产资料和生活资料等各种货物二百四十万吨左右，比1957年实际货运量（即除去施工材料运输）提高30％左右，其中预定运出木材一百二十万吨左右，比1957年增加近50％。
    鹰厦铁路自1956年上半年伸进福建和1956年底全线修通起，担任施工的中国人民解放军铁道兵部队一面进行新线维护整修，一面自北而南逐段到全线办理临时营业。在临时营业的一年多时间内，福建境内以铁路为骨干的四通八达的水陆交通运输网已经初步形成，铁路沿线两侧新建和开辟了长达三千五百八十七公里的六十八条公路和内河汽船航道。从根本上改变了福建山区交通落后的面貌，大批木材、毛竹和其他山区土特产品，源源由水路公路运抵鹰厦铁路沿线，由火车廉价而迅速地运往全国各地。其中仅1957年内由铁路运往全国各工矿企业生产建设基地的木材即达一百多万立方公尺，相当于铁路修建前福建林区两三年的木材外运总量。过去因交通困难从未外运过的毛竹，去年也第一次运出六百万根。福建沿海和山区工农业生产建设中所需省外支援的物资，也都从东北、上海等各地由火车直接运来福建，有力地支援和促进了福建山区、沿海地区各项生产建设的迅速发展，增加了福建山区人民的经济收入。
