Absolutely Not a "Burden"
Why is it that when handling people's letters and visits, some people handle them actively and responsibly, while others handle them in a "perfunctory" manner? Why is it that the same person felt unhappy when handling people's letters and visits before the rectification campaign, but feels relaxed and happy after the rectification campaign? What is the reason? The reason is that some people have an unclear understanding of the significance of handling people's letters and visits; or, starting from their own personal gains and losses, they regard the work of handling people's letters and visits as a "dead-end" "chore" or as a "burden."

In fact, handling people's letters and visits is a work with significant political meaning. The reason why people write letters and pay visits is that they have problems that they cannot solve themselves and they ask higher-level leading organs to solve them. These problems may be between the people, or between the people and the leading organs and leading cadres. Most of these internal problems of the people are contradictions among the people. Carefully handling these people's letters and visits can timely understand and adjust, and ease the contradictions among the people, making the people more united and the relationship between the people and the leading organs closer. The Ministry of Internal Affairs received many letters expressing satisfaction and gratitude for the handling after improving the work of handling people's letters and visits, which is a proof.

Now some people say that they want to understand and handle the contradictions among the people in a timely manner, but when the people bring the contradictions to them, they do not handle them. Isn't this like Ye Gong, who claimed to love dragons, but was scared when he actually saw one?

Handling letters and visits also has a benefit. Through a large number of letters and visits, we can understand the implementation of the Party and the state's policies and guidelines among the people, and we can understand the emotions and demands of various classes and strata. By understanding these situations, the leading organs of the Party and the state can more actively improve their work.

How can such work with top political significance be said to be a "dead end," how can it be said to be a "chore," and how can it be regarded as a "burden"?

If we must say that this work is a "dead end" and a "chore," then in the minds of these people, the work of the Party and the state is divided into two types: "promising" and "not promising." Whether it is promising or not is essentially whether there is fame and fortune, status. In the eyes of these people, work that is in the limelight is naturally "promising," and work that is silent and unknown is naturally "not promising." And handling people's letters and visits is precisely a work that has neither fame nor fortune, so it is no wonder that some people regard it as a "burden" and feel unhappy.

This kind of thinking is of course wrong, and of course it should be rectified!

### 决不是“包袱”

    决不是“包袱”
  为什么同样是处理人民来信来访的工作，有的人处理起来积极负责，有的人处理起来却“公事公办”？为什么同样是一个人，整风前做处理人民来信来访工作，心里总觉得不愉快，整风后却心情舒畅。原因在哪里？原因就在于有的人对处理人民来信来访工作的意义认识不清；或者从个人的得失出发，把处理人民来信来访的工作当做“没有奔头”的“打杂工作”或者当做“包袱”。
    其实，处理人民来信来访是一件有着重大政治意义的工作。人民所以来信来访，一定是有了自己不能解决的问题，要求高一级领导机关来解决。这些问题可能是人民群众之间的，也可能是人民群众和领导机关、领导干部之间的。这些人民内部的问题，绝大部分都是人民内部矛盾。认真地处理这些人民来信来访，就可以及时了解和调节、缓和人民内部矛盾，使人民群众之间更加团结，人民群众与领导机关的关系也更加密切。内务部改进了处理人民来信来访工作以后，得到了许多对处理表示满意和感谢的来信，就是一个证明。
    现在有些人虽然表示要及时了解与处理人民内部的矛盾，但是当人民群众把矛盾提到他们的面前的时候，他们却不去处理，这岂不是像好龙的叶公一样么？
    处理来信来访，还有个好处，通过大量来信来访，可以了解党和国家的方针政策在人民群众中贯彻执行的情形，可以了解各阶级、各阶层的情绪和要求。了解了这些情况，党和国家的领导机关，就能更加主动地改进自己的工作。
    这样具有头等政治意义的工作，怎么能说是“没有奔头”，怎么能说是“打杂工作”，怎么能把它当成“包袱”？
    一定要说这项工作“没有奔头”，是“打杂工作”，那就是在这些人的思想里，把党和国家的工作分成“有奔头”和“没有奔头”两种，所谓有没有奔头，实质上就是有没有名利、地位。在这些人看来，出头露面的工作，自然就是“有奔头”的工作，默默无闻的工作，自然就是“没有奔头”的工作了。而处理人民来信来访，就正是既没有名又没有利的工作，因此，就难怪有些人要把它当做“包袱”，要心情不舒畅了。
    这种思想当然是错误的，也当然应该整改掉！
