    Cultivating Children's Independent Living Skills
    Zhang Yunfei
    From the age of three, parents should pay attention to teaching children to develop independent living skills. For example, cultivate their ability to gradually learn to comb their hair, wash their face, brush their teeth, and rinse their mouth. When going to bed, children should be allowed to take off their clothes themselves and fold them neatly. In the morning, let the children dress themselves and make their beds. Also, let the children develop the habit of managing their own belongings.
    Many parents do not pay enough attention to these issues. They feel that the child is too young to do it, or they think that the child is clumsy, slow, and doesn't do it well, so it's better for the mother to do it for them. Under the cultivation of these parents, children develop dependency and lack independent living skills.
    We know that only through practical exercises such as washing their face, dressing themselves, and making their beds can children's movements become more skillful, and their intelligence will also develop. For example, when dressing, children need to pay attention to distinguishing between the front and back of the clothes; paying attention to how to align the buttonholes and button the buttons; and how to avoid putting both legs into one pant leg. All of this requires the child's observation, comparison, and thinking. When children have finished doing what they can do, they will feel happy and satisfied, and gradually develop an optimistic and positive character. Actions like washing and dressing are relatively complex for three- or four-year-olds, but if adults help them patiently and believe in them, and they develop confidence, they will slowly do things well.
    Once, three-year-old Xiaoming's mother was in a hurry to go to work. Seeing that her little daughter was seriously buttoning her coat, she hurried to button it for her. But Xiaoming was very unhappy and muttered, "Who wants you to button my buttons? I was almost finished!" After saying that, she unbuttoned the buttons that her mother had buttoned for her and started over until she had buttoned them herself, and a satisfied smile appeared on her little face.
    Naturally, children cannot do these things well all at once when they are learning, but the situation is completely different once these actions become habits. By then, after getting up every morning, the child will dress, wash, brush their teeth, comb their hair, and make their bed in an orderly manner, without the need for adults to remind or supervise them. They do each thing one by one, in an orderly manner, and without much effort.
    The most important thing for developing good habits in children is to let them practice continuously. Don't make decisions based on the adults' emotions. Don't only let the child do it when you are happy and stop them when you are not. When asking a child to do something, don't be stern and force them to do it. You should explain to them how to do it in a very kind manner. At first, when the child doesn't know how to do it, you should teach them patiently. If they make progress, you should praise and encourage them.
    The adults in the family should have consistent requirements for the child. If the mother wants the child to make the bed, but the father says it doesn't matter whether they make it or not; and the grandmother thinks the grandson is too young and can't make it, and comes over to make it for him, the child will naturally be unable to develop good habits if everyone has different requirements for the child.
    In addition to the consistent requirements of the adults around them, the adults' setting an example has a great influence on the development of good habits in children. When my eldest daughter was five years old, she often forgot to make her bed. One day I said to her, "You can remember everything else, how come you always forget to make your bed?" She said without hesitation, "Dad never makes his own bed, why don't you tell him?" Later, her father made his bed, and the eldest daughter did it without needing to be reminded.
    Teaching children to do things requires patience and attention to methods. When you start teaching them to do something, you should demonstrate it while telling them how to do it, so that the child can learn easily. If the child doesn't do it well, don't criticize them by saying, "Look, it's so easy, how can you never learn it? I've never seen anyone so clumsy." "Go away, you can't even make the bed well after doing it for so long." This will make the child lose confidence and dare not try to do it again.
    Requirements should also be different for children of different ages. For three- or four-year-olds, making the bed and brushing their teeth are things they cannot do, but they can learn to wash their hands, wash their face, and dress and undress themselves; in the beginning, adults have to help them. But when helping them, don't let them feel incompetent, but let them feel that they are doing it themselves, and the mother is just helping a little. For five-year-olds, you can gradually teach them to brush their teeth, make their bed, tie their shoelaces, etc. For six-year-olds, making the bed, brushing their teeth, brushing their shoes, and organizing their drawers are all things they can do completely on their own, and you can also ask them to do it quickly and well.
    Cultivating children to gradually develop independent living skills is an important part of children's education. This is greatly related to the development of children's intelligence, the development of children's neat habits, the cultivation of children's self-confidence, and the formation of children's optimistic and positive character. Parents should encourage their children to do what they can do themselves and let them consolidate what they have learned to form good habits.

    培养孩子独立的生活能力
    张韵斐
    孩子从三岁起，就要注意教他养成独立的生活能力。例如，培养他逐渐学会梳头、洗脸、刷牙和嗽口；睡觉的时候，要让孩子自己脱衣服，再把衣服折起来、放好；早晨起床，让孩子自己穿衣服、铺床；孩子自己的东西，也让他养成自己管理的习惯。
    有不少父母对这些问题注意不够。他们觉得孩子小不会做，或者嫌孩子做起来又笨、又慢、又做不好，还不如妈妈代替做来得痛快。在这些父母的培养下，使得孩子们养成了依赖性，缺乏独立的生活能力。
    我们知道孩子只有在洗脸、穿衣服、铺床等实际练习中，才能使自己的动作由笨手笨脚变得利索，智力也随着得到发展。比如，在穿衣服的时候，孩子就要注意辨别反、正面；注意怎样才能对准扣眼，把扣子扣进去；怎样才不致于把两条腿穿到一条裤腿里去。这一切都需要孩子的观察、比较和思考。当孩子把自己能做的事情做完以后，就会感到愉快、满足，逐渐养成一种乐观向上的性格。像梳洗、穿衣服，对三、四岁的孩子来说，是比较复杂的动作，但是如果大人耐心地帮助他，相信他，他产生了信心，就慢慢地把事情做好了。
    三岁的小明，有一次，她的妈妈急着要上班，看到小女儿还正在一本正经地扣大衣扣子，就急着替她扣好了。可是她很不高兴，叽哩咕噜地说：“谁要你给我扣扣子，我不是快扣进去了吗？”说完，就把妈妈替他扣好的扣子解开，重新再来，一直等到她自己又扣好了，小脸上才露出了满意的笑容。
    自然，孩子在学做这些事情的时候，不是一下就能做好的，但是当这些动作形成习惯以后，情形就完全不同了。到那时候，孩子每天早晨起床之后，他就会按部就班地自己穿好衣服、洗脸、刷牙、梳头、铺床，一点不必成人在旁边提醒他、督促他，他一件一件地做，很有秩序，也不费力。
    要养成孩子的好习惯，最重要的是让孩子坚持不断地练习。不要从大人的情绪出发，高兴了就让他做；不高兴了，就不让他做。要孩子做事的时候，不要板着面孔，硬逼着孩子做，应该非常和蔼地讲给他这件事情应该怎样做。最初，孩子不会做的时候，要耐心教他，有进步就要夸奖他、鼓励他。
    家里的大人，向孩子提的要求要一致。如果妈妈要孩子铺床，爸爸表示铺不铺都无所谓；奶奶呢，又嫌孙子还小，不会铺，过来代替孙子铺了。各人对孩子的要求不一样，自然，孩子就无法养成好习惯。
    除了周围成人都坚持一致的要求以外，成人的以身作则，对儿童好习惯的养成，也有很大影响。当我的大女儿五岁的时候，常常忘记铺床。有一天我对她说：“你别的都记得住，怎么总是忘了铺床？”她毫不犹豫地说：“爸爸的床，自己总也不铺，你怎么不说他？”后来爸爸铺了，大女儿也就不必提醒就去做了。
    教孩子做事要耐心、要讲究方法。开始教给他做的时候，要一边做给孩子看，一边告诉孩子，这样孩子学起来就容易。如果孩子做不好，千万不要指责他说：“你瞧，多容易的事，怎么总也学不会，没见过这么笨手笨脚的。”“走开，看你铺了半天床还铺不好。”这样会使孩子丧失信心，不敢再试着做。
    对于不同年龄的孩子，要求也要不同。对三、四岁的孩子来说，铺床、刷牙都是他做不到的，但他可以学洗手、洗脸、穿脱衣服；在开始的时候，大人得帮助他。但是在帮助他的时候，不要让他感到自己无能，而要他感到主要是自己做的，妈妈只是帮了一下忙。对五岁的孩子，就可以逐步教会他刷牙、铺床、系鞋带等等。对六岁的孩子来说，铺床、刷牙、刷鞋，整理抽屉，自己完全能做得到，而且还可以要求他做得快，做得好。
    培养孩子逐渐养成独立的生活能力，这是儿童教育的一个重要组成部分，这对孩子的智力发展，对孩子整洁习惯的养成，对孩子自信心的培养，对孩子乐观向上性格的形成，都有很大关系。家长们应该鼓励自己的孩子，凡是他自己能做的事，就让他自己去做，并且让他把已经学会的事情巩固下来，形成一种良好的习惯。
