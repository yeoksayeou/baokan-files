Shandong Party Congress Decides to Deepen the Rectification Movement to Promote a Production Upsurge
Striving for a Double Harvest in Ideology and Production
Calling on All Cadres to Improve Their Work Style to Become Both Red and Expert
(Our report) The central topic of the Second Session of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Shandong Provincial Committee, held from December 9th to 23rd last year, was how to comprehensively and thoroughly carry out the nationwide rectification movement and initiate a high tide in industrial and agricultural production. The proposed goal of increasing grain and cotton production in the province by more than 10% annually has become a common and unified goal to strive for.

This meeting was convened after the provincial four-level cadre meeting, and these two meetings were organically combined. Because the four-level cadre meeting solved the problems of evaluating past work and related ideological issues through extensive airing of views, full blooming, and great debates, this meeting could continue to implement the spirit of extensive airing of views, full blooming, and great debates, and fully discuss future work issues. At the same time, this meeting continued to resolve the remaining issues from the four-level cadre meeting, such as helping some comrades with erroneous ideas to continue to conduct in-depth self-criticism and improve their understanding, thereby consolidating and expanding the achievements of the four-level cadre meeting.

At the beginning of the meeting, Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered a work report to the congress on behalf of the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee, entitled "Comprehensively Launch the Rectification Movement and Vigorously Initiate a Production Upsurge." After discussion, the meeting unanimously approved this report.

The meeting held that although the nationwide rectification movement in Shandong Province has gradually unfolded and achieved significant victories, its development is still very uneven; some people still do not fully understand the serious significance of the rectification movement and the arduousness of the rectification tasks. In particular, there is still a lack of enthusiasm for boldly and freely launching airing of views, drawing fire on oneself, and earnestly correcting one's shortcomings and mistakes. It is necessary to carry out the rectification movement with the same vigor as launching a production movement, and to make the rectification movement a huge driving force for promoting the production upsurge. First, it is necessary to seize the time to do a good job of rectification in the leading organs and leading cadres, that is, to first do a good job of rectification in the leading organs at the provincial, district (city), county, and district levels from top to bottom, and then, in a planned and step-by-step manner, unfold the rectification of grassroots units and general Party members and cadres, and comprehensively carry out Party rectification, Youth League rectification, and cooperative rectification in rural areas. The meeting attached great importance to implementing the spirit of rectifying while correcting and using rectification to promote production, believing that one cannot neglect and relax leadership and control over the rectification movement because of being busy leading production.

The delegates discussed with great enthusiasm the draft outline (revised draft) of the Shandong Province's plan for implementing the National Agricultural Development Program (revised draft) from 1956 to 1967, as proposed by the Provincial Party Committee. The specific production increase targets proposed in this planning outline are: by 1962, the total grain output of the province will be increased from 25.93 billion jin in 1957 to 44 billion jin, with an annual increase of 11.2% (in the first four years of the first Five-Year Plan, the annual increase was 3.9%); cotton (lint cotton, the same below) will reach 6.6 million dan, with an annual increase of 12.3%; peanuts will reach 3.3 billion jin, with an annual increase of 13.7%. The average annual income per person will reach about 100 yuan (including grain), roughly exceeding the production and income level of the average well-to-do middle peasant in the local area. By 1967, the total grain output of the province is required to reach 60 billion jin, with a yield of more than 500 jin per mu; cotton will reach 9.6 million dan, with a yield of 80 jin per mu; peanuts will reach 4.4 billion jin; flue-cured tobacco will reach 3.5 million dan; large livestock will develop to 6 million head; pigs will develop to 40 million head (three to four per household); the irrigated area will reach 100 million mu, basically realizing the water conservancy of the whole province; each person will have about 1,000 jin of grain, and the average annual income per person will reach 150 yuan (including grain).

In order to ensure the realization of the requirements of the agricultural development plan, each county has put forward its own planning targets in accordance with local conditions. Twelve counties have resolved to strive to become high-yield grain counties this year, and seven counties have resolved to strive to become high-yield cotton counties. These counties will achieve the 1967 targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program this year. Huang County, the first county in the province to reach this target ahead of schedule, put forward at the meeting the magnificent goal of "700 jin this year, travel to Jiangnan next year, and become a 1,000-jin county in 1962," which greatly encouraged all the participants. Representatives of many counties examined their right-leaning conservative thinking and revised the agricultural production increase targets for their counties and regions at the meeting. The meeting also gave great importance to the development of diversified economy, especially the development of production in mountainous areas, oceans, and lakes.

The meeting also put forward the goal of initiating a high tide in industrial production while achieving a great leap forward in agricultural production, that is: in addition to the new and expanded enterprises invested and built by the central government in Shandong Province, local industries in the province will, during the second Five-Year Plan, increase the total output value by 87.16% by 1962 compared to 1957 through tapping potential and carrying out labor competitions, with an average annual increase of 13.4%.

The meeting held that to achieve the above-mentioned indicators for the great leap forward in production, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over production. Developing agricultural production should be regarded as the primary task of the entire Party in Shandong, and at the same time, attention should also be paid to the development of industrial production. Rural Party committees should go all out to develop agricultural production; urban (town) Party committees should face the countryside and vigorously support agricultural production. Party committees at all levels should also effectively change the general approach to leading agricultural production. The first secretary of the Party committee must personally take charge of everything from ideological mobilization to formulating plans, organizing implementation, and demonstrating typical examples; leading cadres at and above the county level must spend at least one-third of their time each year working at the grassroots level on a rotating basis, going to the front line of production; it is necessary to humbly learn and promote the experiences of other regions, and pay special attention to promoting the experiences of Macheng and Hongan counties in Hubei in conducting experimental fields and the experience of Henan in comprehensively managing the Manghe River. In the future, we should also focus on the comprehensive planning and typical experiences of one district, one county, one river basin, and one mountainous area; through production practice, we should train ourselves into agricultural production experts who are both red and expert.

The meeting called on Party organizations and all Party member cadres at all levels in Shandong to comprehensively and thoroughly carry out the rectification movement in accordance with the spirit and requirements of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, to initiate a high tide in agricultural and industrial production, and to strive for a double harvest in ideology and production.

A total of more than 1,500 people attended this conference, including 845 formal delegates.

During the meeting, Comrade Mao Zedong met with all the delegates and participants. Chairman Mao's meeting gave great encouragement to all the participants.

The CPC Hebei, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu Provincial Committees were all invited to send delegations to participate in the meeting to exchange leadership experiences with each other.

    山东党代会决定深入整风运动推动生产高潮
    争取思想上和生产上两大丰收
    号召所有干部改进作风使自己又红又专
    本报讯　如何全面深入地开展全民整风运动，掀起工农业生产高潮，这是去年12月9日至23日召开的中共山东省第一届代表大会第二次会议的中心议题。而会上提出的全省粮棉增产，今后每年递增10％以上，已成为共同一致的奋斗目标。
    这次会议是继全省四级干部会议以后召开的，并且这两次会议又是有机地结合进行的。由于四级干部会议通过大鸣大放大争，解决了对过去工作的估价问题，以及有关的思想问题，就使这次会议可以继续贯彻大鸣大放大争的精神，充分地讨论今后工作问题；同时在这次会议上，又继续解决了四级干部会的遗留问题，如帮助某些有错误思想的同志继续深入检查，提高认识，巩固与扩大了四级干部会的成果。
    会议开始，首先由省委第一书记舒同同志代表中共山东省委向大会作了“全面开展整风运动，大力掀起生产高潮”的工作报告，经过会议讨论，一致批准了这一报告。
    会议认为：山东全省的全民整风运动，虽已逐步展开，并已取得重大胜利，但是发展还很不平衡；还有一些人对整风运动的严重意义和整风任务的艰巨性认识不足。特别是对大胆放手地发动鸣放，引火烧身，以及对认真改正自己的缺点、错误还存在着劲头不足的现象。必须拿出像开展生产运动一样的劲头来开展整风运动，并使整风运动成为推进生产高潮的巨大动力。首先抓紧时间在领导机关与领导干部中搞好整风，就是先要自上而下地搞好省、地（市）、县、区各级领导机关的整风，然后再有计划、有步骤地展开基层单位和一般党员干部的整风，全面进行农村的整党、整团、整社。会议十分重视贯彻边整边改和用整风推动生产的精神，认为不能因为忙于领导生产，便忽视放松对整风运动的领导与掌握。
    与会代表以极大热情讨论了省委提出的山东省实施1956年至1967年全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的规划纲要（修正草案）。这一规划纲要提出的具体增产指标是：到1962年全省粮食总产量由1957年的二百五十九点三亿斤，提高到四百四十亿斤，每年递增11.2％（第一个五年计划的前四年，每年递增3.9％）；棉花（皮棉、下同）达到六百六十万担，每年递增12.3％；花生达到三十三亿斤，年增13.7％。每人平均全年收入达到一百元左右
  （包括粮食），大体上超过当地一般富裕中农的生产与收入水平。到1967年，要求全省粮食总产量达到六百亿斤，亩产达到五百斤以上；棉花达到九百六十万担，亩产八十斤；花生达到四十四亿斤；烤烟达到三百五十万担；大家畜发展到六百万头；生猪发展到四千万头（每户三至四头）；灌溉面积达到一亿亩，基本上实现全省水利化；每人占有粮食一千斤左右，每人平均全年收入达到一百五十元（包括粮食）。
    为了保证实现农业发展规划的要求，每个县都因地制宜地提出了本县的规划指标，已有十二个县决心在今年争取成为粮食高额丰产县，七个县争取成为棉花高额丰产县，这些县要在今年实现全国农业发展纲要规定的1967年指标。全省第一个已提前达到这个指标的黄县在会上提出：“今年七百斤，明年下江南，1962年成为千斤县”的雄伟的奋斗目标，给全体与会人员以很大鼓舞。许多县的代表检查了自己的右倾保守思想，在大会上重新修订了本县本地区的农业增产指标。会议对发展多种经济、特别是发展山区、海洋、湖泊生产，也给以极大的重视。
    会议还提出了在农业生产大跃进的同时，掀起工业生产高潮的奋斗目标，那就是：除中央在山东省投资新建、扩建的企业外，本省地方工业在第二个五年计划中，通过挖掘潜力，开展劳动竞赛，要求总产值到1962年时比1957年增长87.16％，平均每年递增13.4％。
    会议认为：要实现上述生产大跃进的指标，必须加强党对生产的领导。发展农业生产应作为山东全党的首要任务，同时也要重视工业生产的发展。农村党委应该全力以赴发展农业生产；城市（镇）党委要面向农村，大力支援农业生产。各级党委还应切实转变领导农业生产一般化的作风。党委第一书记要从思想发动到制订规划、组织贯彻、典型示范，都亲自抓起来；县以上各级领导干部，每年至少拿出三分之一的时间，轮流深入基层工作，亲临生产前线；必须虚心学习推广外地经验，特别注意推广湖北麻城、红安等县搞试验田的经验和河南全面治理漭河经验，今后还应着重搞一个区、一个县、一个流域、一个山区的全面规划和典型经验；通过生产实践，将自己锻炼成又红又专的农业生产专家。
    会议号召：山东各级党组织与全体党员干部按照党的八届三中全会的精神与要求，全面深入开展整风运动，掀起农业与工业生产高潮，为争取思想上和生产上两大丰收而奋斗。
    参加这次大会的共一千五百余人，其中正式代表八百四十五人。
    会议期间，毛泽东同志会见了全体代表和与会人员。毛主席的会见，给了与会全体人员莫大的鼓舞。
    中共河北、河南、安徽、江苏等四个省委都应邀派代表团参加了会议，相互交流了领导经验。
