    Perennial Rat-Catching Method
    This method is very simple. Use a square iron bucket, and drill two round holes near the top edge on both sides. Then use a thin wooden board (plywood thickness is just right), slightly smaller than the bucket opening, and nail two slippery iron pieces on both sides.

    Use a round wooden stick (thumb-thick) to pass the wooden board through the iron bucket, arranging it to be balanced. Afterwards, use string to tie one or two pieces of food, tying them in the middle of the round wooden stick, with the food resting on the board.

    Dig a square pit in the ground, place the iron bucket inside, making the bucket opening level with the ground, and fill the surrounding area of the bucket tightly with soil.

    In this way, when the rat comes out, it will definitely want to eat the food. But it must get on the board to eat it. Once it gets on the board, the board will lose its balance, flipping the rat into the bucket. The food is tied with a string and won't fall down, so the rat can't eat anything. Then the board will automatically re-balance, blocking the bucket opening, so the rat can't climb out (in reality, the bucket is slippery, more than two feet deep, and once flipped in, it can't climb out even without the board).

    This rat-catching method is most suitable for granaries in rural farmhouses or places with many rats. It can catch several, or even a dozen, rats in one night. And this is a perennial rat-catching method, which can be left out all year round. If the food goes bad, replace it, and just take a look at it every day.

    When taking the captured rats out, you can put a cat into the bucket to grab them out. If there are too many, you can lift the bucket out of the ground, block the bucket opening with a sack, lift the bucket and pour it into the sack. Then pinch the sack opening and beat them all to death. Su Beichao

### 常年捕鼠法

    常年捕鼠法
    这个办法很简单，用一个方形铁桶，两边靠上沿穿两个圆孔。再用一块薄木板（胶合板厚正好），略小于桶口，在两边钉上滑点的两个铁片。
    用一根圆木棒（拇指粗），把木板穿在铁桶上，安排平衡。以后，用线绳拴一块或两块食物，绑在圆木棒中间，食物落在板上。
    把地挖个方坑，把铁桶下进去，桶口与地面相平，桶的四周用土弥严。
    这样老鼠出来，看见食物非要吃不可。但必需上板上才能吃到。一上板，板就失去平衡，把老鼠翻进桶去了。食物有线拴着落不下去，鼠一点也吃不着。然后板再自动平衡起来，堵住桶口，老鼠上不来（实际桶是滑的，二尺多深，翻进去没有板也上不来）。
    这种捕鼠法最适用于农村农家的仓房里或鼠多的地方，一宿能捕好几只，甚至十几只。并且这是个常年捕鼠法，可以常年摆着，食物坏了换一换，只要每天溜一遍就行了。
    把老鼠捕住往外取时，可以把猫放进桶去叨出来，多了可以把桶提出土面，以麻袋口堵好桶口，提出桶来一倒就进麻袋了。然后再掐住袋口，统统摔死。　苏北潮
