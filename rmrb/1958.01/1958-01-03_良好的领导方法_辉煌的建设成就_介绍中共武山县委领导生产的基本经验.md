Good Leadership Methods, Brilliant Construction Achievements
    --Introducing the Basic Experience of the CPC Wushan County Committee in Leading Production
    By Our Correspondent Gu Lei
    Editor's Note: What is introduced here are the leadership methods and experiences of Wushan County, Gansu. In this county, where the natural conditions are not very good, the people's economic and cultural life has undergone fundamental changes in just a few years under the leadership of the county committee. These seemingly ordinary leadership methods have brought about fundamental changes in the county because the leaders of the county have earnestly implemented them. The fundamental task of leaders is to change the status quo and enable the people to live a better material and cultural life. Leaders in some places where changes have been slow may find some inspiration from reading this experience.

    The People's Economic and Cultural Life Has Undergone Fundamental Changes
    Wushan County, Gansu Province, does not have very good natural conditions, but in the past two years, its economic and cultural landscape has rapidly undergone fundamental changes. As a result, it has been praised by the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee.
    There are more than thirty large mountains in the county. Of the 2.4 million mu of land (including cultivated area), more than 2.2 million mu are hills and ravines. Before liberation, 2.4 million cubic meters of soil and water were lost annually. Although there are rivers such as the Wei River and Shandan River in the county, the water volume is generally small. The average annual rainfall is 300 to 500 millimeters, mostly concentrated in autumn. The county is basically an arid area. In the past, it was "disaster even with rain, and disaster without rain." In the 1929 famine, more than 10,000 people starved to death in the county. Nearly 1,000 people starved to death in the Zima River Township alone, accounting for 43% of the total population, including 39 families who were completely wiped out. Grain output has always been very low. In 1945, the county produced more than 37 million catties of grain, averaging 64 catties per mu and just over 200 catties per person.
    In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Wushan County have achieved advanced cooperation, actively increased production, overcome various difficulties, and driven away poverty.
    By 1950, the total grain output reached 72 million catties, with a yield of 119 catties per mu and an average of nearly 400 catties per person. In 1957, it is estimated that the grain output will be 154 million catties, with a yield of 194 catties per mu and an average of more than 700 catties per person. The county's farmers are already well-fed and warmly clothed.
    Their measures to increase production are multifaceted, but the main ones are building water conservancy projects and conserving water and soil. Before liberation, the county had only more than 52,000 mu of paddy fields and irrigated land, averaging less than three fen per person. Now there are more than 160,000 mu, averaging more than eight fen per person. Before liberation, the forest area was 220,000 mu, now it has reached 490,000 mu, averaging more than two mu per person. Before liberation, there was no soil and water conservation work. Now it has ensured that 1.5 million mu of land is no longer harmed by soil erosion. Before liberation, there was no habit of applying fertilizer. Now, each mu of irrigated land reaches more than 6,000 catties, and each mu of mountain land reaches more than 400 catties. Other measures such as using improved varieties, promoting new agricultural tools, advocating intercropping, planting a large number of cash crops, and intensive cultivation have all been done relatively well.
    Grain production has increased, farmers' incomes have increased, and many things have become easier to handle. The county has been able to overfulfill the grain requisition and purchase tasks every year, and has been repeatedly praised by the special district. More prominent is the prosperity of culture and transportation. Now, Wushan County is: every commune has postal service, every commune has telephones, every commune has broadcasting, every commune has schools, and every household has students; there are 161 clubs and 68 amateur theater troupes. The enthusiasm of the masses in running cultural undertakings is high. Taking schools as an example, before liberation, most school-age children were out of school. Now, of the 145 primary schools in the county, 108 are run by the masses, and more than 80% of the county's school-age children have enrolled in school, which is higher than the national proportion of school-age children enrolled in school. Of the more than 63,000 illiterate people in the county, 53,000 have enrolled in school, and 23,000 have already graduated.
    In the winter of 1957, on the ideological basis of great airing of views, great debates, and under the encouragement of the "National Agricultural Development Program," the slogan of "Five Transformations" was put forward: (1) From this winter to next spring, and from next winter to the spring after that, the irrigated land and water-fed land should reach more than 519,000 mu, accounting for 63.8% of the cultivated area, basically realizing water conservancy; (2) Within two years, "one person will afforest one mu of barren mountains, and each household will plant ten fruit trees." Together with the original forest area, the forest will account for more than 35% of the total area, realizing the greening of the entire county; (3) Continue to strengthen soil and water conservation work, and make the mountain land terraced within two years; (4) Combine water conservancy construction with the vigorous construction of small hydropower stations, and universally solve the problem of rural lighting and partial power consumption within three years, initially realizing electrification; (5) In 1958, more than 95% of school-age children should be enrolled in school, realizing the popularization of primary school education; At the same time, focus on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, and correspondingly strengthen other production increase measures to ensure that during the second five-year plan period, the output per mu will exceed 500 catties, and the average per person will be 1,654 catties (excluding seeds, feed, and public grain).
    Turning a poor, grain-deficient county into a relatively wealthy, grain-surplus county is the result of the CPC Wushan County Committee's practical application of seemingly ordinary, but actually indispensable, basic leadership methods to lead the masses forward.

    Establish a Clear Production Viewpoint, Humbly Learn from Experiences in Other Places
    In the entire leadership work of the CPC Wushan County Committee (hereinafter referred to as the County Committee), the most active and brilliant spark is: a clear production viewpoint.
    In recent years, the County Committee has consistently regarded developing production as the overriding center, and based on this, arranged the central work, priorities, and other tasks for each period. On a regular annual basis, it is: spring focuses on completing spring planting, with soil and water conservation and water conservancy as the priorities; summer focuses on summer harvesting, with summer distribution as the priority; autumn focuses on protecting the autumn harvest, with grain requisition and purchase as the priority; winter focuses on developing sideline production and preparing for next year's production, with rectification of communes as the priority. In short, production is inseparable from three sentences, and strict control is exercised so that no professional work affects production. When various professional departments go to the countryside to carry out their own work, the County Committee designates them to contact a village or commune. They must help this village and commune to first improve production, and then carry out their own work, and report the work situation to the County Committee. This has created a habit of everyone caring about production and everyone going to lead production, putting production on a solid leadership foundation.
    The natural environment of Wushan County is very complex, and there are different ways to develop production in different places. In order to develop production in such a place and ensure an increase in farmers' income, the County Committee has always adhered to the principle of "adapting to local conditions, comprehensively developing the economy, and extracting all wealth from nature." In the vicinity of forest areas, they lead the masses to "raise trees without disasters, trees support people in disasters, close mountains for afforestation, and combine agriculture, forestry, and sideline occupations"; in mountainous and riverine areas, they lead the masses to "eliminate arid river plains, bring water to the mountains, build large-scale water conservancy projects, and overcome drought"; in areas with soil erosion, they lead the masses to "green barren mountains and seize five materials (food, feed, fertilizer, fuel, building materials)." Throughout the county, they persistently lead the masses to achieve the task of "bumper harvests of grains, prosperity of livestock, and flourishing forestry and sideline occupations," so that farmers in any place can increase their income, improving farmers' support and trust in the Party.
    When farmers struggle against nature, they also reveal many conservative and backward ideas, mainly not believing in their own strength, which is the biggest obstacle to developing production. The County Committee attaches great importance to this issue, and has adopted firm and resolute steps to fight against conservative ideas, turning the process of developing production into a process of fighting against conservative and habitual forces. The method of struggle is not orders, empty preaching, criticism, and accusations, but through leading practical actions to increase production, using the achievements to influence farmers and make them consciously change. Taking water conservancy as an example, in the great drought of 1953, many farmers believed that humans could not conquer nature, so they slaughtered pigs and sheep and worshiped gods to pray for rain. When cadres went to persuade them, some were even beaten. At this time, the County Committee immediately mobilized cadres to dissuade them, while sending some stronger cadres to mobilize a group of activists to build small-scale water conservancy projects to irrigate the land and protect the seedlings. As a result, the townships that prayed for rain had poor harvests, while the townships that built water conservancy projects had bumper harvests. The facts educated the farmers, and then a movement to build small-scale water conservancy projects was launched throughout the county. For example, when promoting high-yield corn varieties in 1956, because the masses had not grown them before, there was great resistance. Some people composed a song: "Want to eat a little cornmeal, plow and plant seven or eight times, old cows and commune members suffer, wasting seven or eight ten thousand workdays!" The County Committee leaders did not shrink back in this situation, but still instructed cadres at all levels to work hard to persuade the masses, calling on Party members and Youth League members to take the lead and insist on promoting this new crop. As a result, ten thousand mu of corn increased production by more than ten million catties. In many similar situations, the County Committee has always been unshakable. The County Committee also often sends stronger cadres to form work teams to go to places where production is very backward and there are many difficulties, to remove the shackles imposed on production by backward habits. After the above-mentioned struggles, the development of production was placed on the ideological foundation that old habits can be changed and that man can conquer nature.
    Farmers in Wushan County have shortcomings in production technology, such as careless cultivation and a lack of improved varieties. Therefore, the County Committee attaches great importance to learning production experience from other places and widely learns methods to increase production. On the one hand, they organize a large number of people to visit other places, and on the other hand, they mobilize everyone to subscribe to newspapers from other places. Taking newspaper subscriptions as an example, in addition to subscribing to 1,521 copies of Gansu Daily and Gansu Farmer's Daily, they also subscribed to 229 copies of People's Daily, Shanxi Daily, Heilongjiang Daily, and Shaanxi Daily. Whether it is visiting or reading newspapers, they learn advanced experiences when they encounter them. For example, they learned about building ponds to store water from Sichuan, learned about high-yield corn from Shanxi Daily, and learned about the experience of the Jinshilong Cooperative's three-contract system from Heilongjiang Daily. Humbly learning from the experience of other places has become a trend in Wushan, which has put production on the basis of constantly mastering advanced experience.

    Divide Areas for Responsibility, Do a Good Job of Key Points, On-site Visits, Spread Experience
    When leading daily production work, the County Committee always strives to avoid bureaucratic and subjective practices, and issues few or no formal instructions, empty calls, or general requirements. The methods they often adopt are: actively establishing a work style and system that connects with reality, cultivating typical examples from the process of going deep into reality, establishing various banners, and then using real-life examples to promote work. Experience has proved that this method has achieved extremely good results.
    In recent years, most of the leading comrades of the County Committee have lived below, and only one or two people are often left at home to handle daily affairs. Their main method of going deep into reality is "dividing areas for responsibility." The entire county is divided into nine areas (not a level of organization, nor is there a management agency), and the leading comrades of the County Committee are each assigned to be responsible for one area, and are responsible for the quality of work in this area, similar to regional management in industry. Their main tasks are: to assist the township and commune cadres in the area in conveying the instructions of the higher authorities, avoiding the situation where the grassroots cadres do not convey them comprehensively or deeply, and to organize township and commune cadres to discuss and formulate specific steps and methods for implementing the instructions of the higher authorities based on the local situation through small meetings or symposiums, preventing the occurrence of unrealistic or unenthusiastic problems; based on the instructions of the County Committee, to study the problems and experiences of a certain central task on the spot, and promptly reflect the situation to the County Committee, so that the County Committee can quickly propose steps and methods for completing this work; the person in charge of the area takes a certain number of assistants to teach them methods and cultivate cadres who can independently run communes. In recent years, 125 people have been trained.
    In conjunction with "dividing areas for responsibility," the County Committee attaches great importance to the work of cultivating typical examples. The County Committee stipulates that each area has a key township, each township has a key commune, each commune has a key team, and each team has a key person. The so-called cultivation of key points is to cultivate examples and banners for various tasks. All key points of county-wide significance are mostly directly controlled by the secretary, members, or ministers and section chiefs of the County Committee, who often help these points create experience. As a result, there are various types of typical examples throughout the county, such as Dengjiabao's soil and water conservation, the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative's "three contracts," the Dongshun Agricultural Cooperative's decentralization of power and water to the mountains, Lizhigou's comprehensive integration of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and Mahe's forestry production. In this way, when the County Committee calls on the masses to complete any task, it can calmly present examples and propose relatively systematic methods, which are easily accepted by the masses and will quickly be put into practical action.
    The County Committee attaches great importance to praising and publicizing the experiences and advanced figures who have grown up in the struggle for production. In recent years, a total of 525 model figures have emerged in the agricultural, financial and trade, and cultural and educational systems. Some of these people represent a commune, some represent a department, and some represent personal deeds, and each deed is linked to the development of economic and cultural undertakings. The County Committee not only regularly publicizes their achievements through newspapers and radio, but also designates people from various systems to be responsible for continuing to cultivate and educate model figures, requiring them to connect with the masses and continue to create new achievements. In this way, various model deeds will not be a flash in the pan, but can often shine with the brilliance of new achievements, and the County Committee can draw on their strength at any time to guide practical work.
    After any advanced experience comes out, the County Committee immediately seizes the promotion work and promotes the universalization of this experience. There are two methods: one is to organize the people who created the experience to promote it everywhere, and the other is to organize farmers to visit the site. Both of these methods lie in using living reality to educate the masses. In the past, Wushan County did not have the habit of conserving soil and water. After Dengjiabao appeared, more than 20,000 people were organized to visit the site, and the farmers of Dengjiabao explained the methods of soil and water conservation, the process of ideological struggle, and the economic changes before and after soil and water conservation. As a result, 109 Dengjiabao's appeared throughout the county, turning the environment of "small people and shallow gullies, old people and deep gullies, small rains hanging from the rafters, and heavy rains washing away" into a beautiful scene of "water not going down the slope, mud not going out of the gully, every field has ridges, every gully has dams, every slope has grass, trees become forests, green shade covers the mountains, and mountain bay paddy fields." Frequent organization of visits has formed a good atmosphere of advanced glory, learning from the advanced, and competing with each other throughout the county. Now, township and commune cadres ask each other when they meet: "What advanced experience have you created?" (To be continued)

    良好的领导方法　辉煌的建设成就
    ——介绍中共武山县委领导生产的基本经验
    本报记者　顾雷
    编者按：这里介绍的是甘肃武山县的领导方法和经验。这个自然条件并不很好的县，在县委这样领导下，仅仅几年的时间，人民的经济文化生活就发生了根本变化。这些看来是普通的领导方法，只是由于这个县的领导者这样认真地贯彻实行了，于是这个县的面貌就发生了根本的变化。领导者的根本任务就是要改变现状，让人民过更好的物质文化生活。一些改变不大的地方的领导者，读一读这个经验，或许会得到一些启示。
    人民的经济文化生活发生了根本变化
    甘肃省武山县的自然条件不大好，近两年经济、文化面貌却很快地发生了根本的变化。因此，受到中共甘肃省委的赞扬。
    这个县境内有三十余座大山，在二百四十余万亩的面积上（中包括耕种面积），二百二十余万亩是丘陵沟壑，解放前每年流失水土二百四十万公方。县内虽有渭河、山丹河等河流，一般情况下水量很小，年雨量平均三百到五百公厘，大都集中在秋季，全县基本属于干旱地区。这里，往年是“有雨也灾，无雨也灾”。1929年一次灾荒，全县饿死一万余人，只马河乡就饿死近千人，占总人口43％，其中有三十九户全家死光了。粮食产量一向很低。1945年，全县产粮三千七百多万斤，平均每亩六十四斤，每人平均二百多斤。
    几年来，武山县的人民，在党的领导下，实现了高级合作化，积极增产，战胜了各种困难，赶走了贫困。
    到1950年，粮食总产量就达到七千二百万斤，亩产一百一十九斤，每人平均近四百斤。1957年，预计产粮一亿五千四百万斤，亩产一百九十四斤，每人平均七百多斤。全县农民已经饱食暖衣。
    他们增产的措施是多方面的，但主要的是兴修水利，保持水土。解放前全县只有水田和水浇地五万二千余亩，每人平均不到三分，现在已有十六万余亩，每人平均八分多。解放前森林面积是二十二万亩，现在已达四十九万亩，每人平均二亩多。解放前没有水土保持工作，现在已保证一百五十万亩的面积上不再受水土流失之害。解放前没有施肥习惯，现在水地每亩达六千斤、山地达四百斤以上。其他如采用优良品种，推广新式农具，提倡复种，大量种植经济作物，深耕细作等，都做得比较好。
    粮食增产了，农民收入增加了，许多事情都好办了。这个县每年都能超额完成征粮、购粮任务，屡受专区的表扬。更突出的是文化、交通的繁荣。现在，武山县是：社社通邮，社社有电话，社社有广播，社社有学校，户户有学生；有俱乐部一百六十一个，业余剧团六十八个。群众办文化事业的热情是高涨的。以学校为例，解放以前大部分学龄儿童失学。现在，全县一百四十五所初小有一百零八所是群众办的，全县学龄儿童80％以上都已入学，高于全国学龄儿童入学的比例。在全县六万三千多名文盲中，已有五万三千人入学，有二万三千人已经毕业。
    1957年冬全县在大鸣大放、大辩论的思想基础上，在“全国农业发展纲要”的鼓舞下，又提出了“五化”的口号：（一）去冬今春、今冬明春要使水地和水浇地达到五十一万九千余亩，占耕地面积63.8％，基本实现水利化；（二）两年内“一人绿化一亩荒山，每户植果树十株”，加上原有森林面积，使森林占总面积35％以上，实现全县绿化；（三）继续加强水土保持工作，两年内使山区土地梯田化；（四）结合兴修水利大力建设小型水电站，三年内普遍解决农村照明、部分动力用电，初步实现电气化；（五）1958年要使95％以上的学龄儿童入学，实现小学教育普及化；同时以水利、积肥为中心并相应加强其他增产措施，保证在第二个五年计划期间，每亩产量超过五百斤，每人平均一千六百五十四斤。（不包括籽种、饲料和公粮）
    把一个贫困、缺粮的县变成较富裕、余粮的县，是中共武山县委切实地运用了看来是普通的、实际上是任何工作都不可缺少的、基本的领导方法，带领群众前进的结果。
    树立明确生产观点  虚心学习外地经验
    在中共武山县委（下称县委）的全部领导工作中，最活跃、最灿烂的火花是：明确的生产观点。
    几年来，县委一直把发展生产当作压倒一切的中心，据此安排各个时期的中心工作、重点以及其他业务的。就常年来说是：春季以完成春播为中心，水土保持和水利是重点；夏季以夏收为中心，夏季分配为重点；秋季以保护秋收为中心，征、购粮食为重点；冬季以开展副业生产和作好来年生产准备为中心，整社为重点。总之，三句话离不开生产，并且严格控制，任何业务工作不得影响生产。各业务部门下乡开展本部门业务时，县委指定他们必须联系一村或一社。帮助这个村和社先搞好生产，而后再开展自己的业务，并将工作情况汇报给县委。这样，造成了人人关心生产、大家都去领导生产的习惯。把生产安放在强有力的领导基础上了。
    武山县的自然环境很复杂，各地都有不同的发展生产的道路。为了在这样一块地方发展生产，保证增加农民收入，县委一直坚持“因地制宜，全面发展经济，向大自然索取一切财富”的方针。在林区附近领导群众“无灾人养树，有灾树养人，封山育林，农（业）林（业）副（业）结合”；在山地和川地领导群众“消灭旱川，水地上山，大修水利，战胜干旱”；在水土流失地区领导群众“绿化荒山，夺取五料（食料、饲料、肥料、燃料、建筑材料）”。在全县范围内，坚持不懈地领导群众实现“五谷丰登，六畜兴旺，林（业）副（业）繁荣”的任务，使任何一个地方的农民，都能增加收入，提高了农民对党的拥护和信任。
    农民在向大自然作斗争的时候，也流露出不少的保守落后思想，主要是不相信自己的力量，这是发展生产的最大障碍。县委非常重视这个问题，曾采用坚定、果敢的步骤同保守思想作斗争，把发展生产的过程变为向保守、习惯势力斗争的过程。斗争的方法，不是命令、空洞的说教、批评和指责，而是通过领导增产的实际行动，用取得的成绩去影响农民，使他们自觉地转变。以修水利为例。1953年大旱，许多农民认为人不能胜天，便杀猪宰羊，拜神求雨。干部去劝说，有的竟挨了打。这时，县委即动员干部一面劝阻，同时派一些较强的干部，去发动一部分积极分子兴修小型水利，浇地保苗。结果，求雨的乡歉收，修水利的乡丰收。事实教育了农民，接着在全县展开了兴修小型水利的运动。又如，1956年推广高产苞米品种时，因群众过去没有种过，抵触情绪很大。有的人编出歌：“想吃一点苞米面，连耕带种七八遍，老牛、社员遭了难，窝工浪费七八万！”县委领导在这种情况下没有畏缩，仍然指示各级干部，努力说服群众，号召党团员带头，坚持推广这一新的作物。结果，十万亩苞米增产了一千多万斤。在许多种类似情形下，县委总是毫不动摇的。县委还经常派出较强的干部组成工作组，到那些生产很落后、困难很多的地方去，解除落后习惯加给生产的束缚。经过上面这些斗争，就把发展生产安放在老习惯可以改变、人定能胜天的思想基础上了。
    武山县农民在生产技术方面有不足之处，如耕作不细致、优良品种少等。因此，县委非常重视学习外地的生产经验，广泛地学习增产的方法。他们一方面组织大量的人到外地参观，一方面发动大家订阅外地报纸。以订报为例，除了订一千五百二十一份甘肃日报、甘肃农民报外，还订阅了二百二十九份人民日报、山西日报、黑龙江日报、陕西日报。无论参观，看报，遇有先进经验就学。如去四川学了打塘蓄水，从山西日报上学了丰产苞米，从黑龙江日报上学到金时龙合作社三包的经验等。虚心学习外地的经验，在武山成了一种风气，这就把生产放在不断掌握先进经验的基础上了。
    分片包干，搞好重点  现场参观，传播经验
    县委在领导日常生产工作时，总是力求避免官僚主义、主观主义的做法，不发或少发条文的指示、空洞的号召、一般化的要求。他们经常采用的方法是：积极地建立联系实际的工作作风和制度，从深入实际过程中培养典型，树立各种旗帜，然后用现实中的榜样去推动工作。经验证明，这种方法收到了极良好的效果。
    几年来，县委的领导同志大部分生活在下边，家里经常只留一两个人处理日常事务。他们深入实际的主要方法是“分片包干”。把全县分成九个片（不是一级组织，也无管理机构），县委领导同志每人分工包一个片，对这一片工作好坏负责，类似工业中的区域管理。他们的主要任务是：协助片里的乡、社干部传达上级指示，避免基层干部传达时不全面、不深刻，通过小型会议或座谈组织乡、社干部根据当地情况，讨论、制定贯彻上级指示的具体步骤和方法，防止发生不务实际或不积极等毛病；根据县委指示，就地研究某一个中心工作的问题、经验，及时把情况反映给县委，便于县委迅速提出完成这一工作的步骤和方法；片的负责人带一定的助手，教给他们办法，培养能独立办社的干部，几年来已培养一百二十五人。
    结合“分片包干”，县委十分强调培养典型的工作，县委规定：每片有重点乡，每乡有重点社，每社有重点队，每队有重点人。所谓培养重点，就是要培养各种工作的榜样、旗帜。凡是有全县意义的重点，大都由县委书记、委员或部长、科长直接掌握，经常帮助这个点创造经验。这样做的结果，全县有各种各样的典型，如邓家堡的水土保持，红星农业社的“三包”，东顺农业社的权利下放和水地上山，李之沟的农林牧全面结合，马河的林业生产等。这样，当县委号召群众去完成任何一件工作的时候，都可以从容不迫地拿出榜样来，提出较为系统的方法，容易为群众所接受，会很快见诸于实际行动。
    县委对于在生产斗争中成长起来的经验和先进人物，非常重视对他们的表扬和宣传。几年来，农业、财贸、文教各系统共涌现模范人物五百二十五人，这些人有的代表一社，有的代表一个部门，有的代表个人的事迹，而每一个事迹都是同发展经济、文化事业联系着的。县委不仅经常通过报纸、广播纲宣传他们的成就，而且指定各系统的人负责对模范人物继续培养、教育，要他们联系群众，继续创造新的成就。这样，各种模范事迹便不会昙花一现，能经常闪烁着新成就的光辉，县委便可以随时从他们身上吸取指导实际工作的力量了。
    任何一次先进经验出来以后，县委立即抓紧推广工作，促使这个经验普遍化。方法有两个：一是组织创造经验的人到各处宣传，另一个是组织农民到现场参观。这两种方法都在于用活的现实去教育群众。过去，武山县没有保持水土的习惯。邓家堡出现以后，先后组织了两万多人到现场参观，由邓家堡的农民讲解水土保持的方法、思想斗争过程、水土保持前后的经济变化。结果，全县出现了一百零九个邓家堡，把“人小沟浅，人老沟深，小雨挂椽，大雨冲光”的环境，变成了“水不下塬，泥不出沟，地地有埂，沟沟有坝，坡坡有草，树木成林，绿荫满山，山湾稻田”的美景了。经常组织参观，在全县形成了先进光荣、向先进学习、相互竞赛的风气。现在，乡、社干部见了面就问：“你们又创造那些先进经验啊？”（未完）
