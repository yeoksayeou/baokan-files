New Commune Member

The Xijie Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gangkou Township, Zhongshan County, has newly admitted sixteen new commune members. They are the first group of junior high school graduates from Guangzhou to go to the countryside in an organized manner to participate in agricultural production. They have been tempered in the first autumn harvest season, and they are determined to train themselves to become genuine members of the agricultural cooperative. Veteran commune members teach new commune members how to carefully select good seed ears (left picture). After participating in agricultural production, they have become more robust (right picture).
