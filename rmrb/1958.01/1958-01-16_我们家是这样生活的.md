    Our Family's Way of Life
    My family consists of six people: my father, mother, me, and three younger sisters. My father is an old cadre who has been in the revolution for twenty years and is now a Major in the army, with a monthly salary of two hundred and twenty yuan. My sisters are all students. My mother is a housewife. Last December, she took my two younger sisters back to the countryside in response to the Party's call. I am a veteran who has returned to civilian life and am now studying at university, receiving an allowance for transferred cadres. Thus, excluding me, each member of my family can get forty-four yuan per month for living expenses, which should be quite sufficient. However, we have always maintained a standard of living not much different from that of ordinary working people. My father has not bought any new clothes to this day, still wearing the clothes issued during the supply system period – they have long been worn old, torn, and faded, but after sewing and mending, they are still clean, simple, and spirited when worn. He smokes dry tobacco and still uses his old pipe. As for my sisters' clothes, the older ones pass them down to the younger ones, one by one. My cotton shoes and cotton clothes have also been worn for three years. I originally wanted to buy new ones, but now I'm saving them. Even so, our living standards have greatly improved compared to the past.
    The reason we can persist in living a relatively frugal life is that our whole family has a consistent view on frugality. First of all, my father and mother often teach us not to forget that frugality is a virtue of the working people, not to forget the life my family had in the past when we had no food to eat, no clothes to wear, and no quilts to cover ourselves with, not to forget the general living standards of the people at present, and not to forget that our country is carrying out socialist construction. Secondly, our whole family can criticize and supervise each other and persist in frugality. For example, last year, because my second sister bought a new schoolbag (the old schoolbag could be sewn up and used again), we all criticized her. As a result, she sewed the broken schoolbag into a shopping bag, and only then did the matter end. Also, the whole family originally planned to make some clothes last year, but this was abandoned due to the temporary shortage of cotton cloth production in the country. Turning over and washing the old clothes saved both money and cloth.
    So, where does our surplus money go? There are four uses: 1. Donations: We once donated one hundred yuan to the farmers to buy a tractor and also donated a double-wheeled double-shared plow (worth one hundred and twenty yuan) to our village's agricultural cooperative. 2. Helping my uncle: His leg is bad, and in order to reduce the burden on the agricultural cooperative, we send him money on time to ensure his livelihood. 3. Buying government bonds: The whole family has bought more than five hundred yuan of government bonds, and we plan to buy another two hundred and fifty yuan this year. 4. Saving in the bank: This is to support national construction and also to prepare for our own unexpected needs.
    Comparing my family's life to that of Huang Xiuying, I feel she is really wasteful because she only cares about herself and not the collective.

### 我们家是这样生活的

    我们家是这样生活的
    我家六口人，父、母、我和三个妹妹。父亲是参加革命二十年的老干部，现在军中是少校，每月薪金二百二十元。妹妹们全是学生。母亲是家庭妇女，在去年12月她带着我的两个小妹妹响应党的号召回乡下去了。我是复员军人，现在大学学习，享有调干助学金。这样除我之外，家里每人每月可得四十四元生活费，这应该是很富足的了。但是，我们一直保持着同一般劳动人民相差不多的生活水平。我父亲到现在还没有买过新衣服，仍然穿着供给制时期发的衣服——它们都早已被穿得旧了、破了、褪了颜色，经过缝缝补补，穿在身上，一样也干干净净，朴素而有精神。他抽的是旱烟，用的还是从前的烟斗。妹妹们的衣服是，大的穿不着了给小的，一个个轮下去。我的棉鞋、棉衣也已经穿了三年了，本想换新的，现在也节省了。就这样，我们的生活比过去还是有很大的提高。
    我们所以能够坚持过着比较节俭的生活，在于我们全家对节俭有着一致的看法。首先，父亲、母亲经常教导我们，不要忘记节俭是劳动人民的美德，不要忘记过去我家没饭吃、没衣穿、没被盖的生活，不要忘记目前人民的一般生活水平，不要忘记我们国家正在进行社会主义建设。其次，我们全家能够互相批评、督促，坚持节俭。比如，去年因为大妹妹买了个新书包（破书包缝缝还可以再用）我们大家就批评了她，结果她把破书包缝成了买菜的包，才结束了这事。又如，全家去年原计划做一些衣服，因国家棉布生产一度供不应求而作罢，把旧衣翻翻、洗洗，既节省了钱，又节省了布。
    那末，我们节余的钱都到那里去了呢？有四个用途：一、捐献，曾捐出一百元给农民买拖拉机，又捐给我们村的农业社一台双轮双铧犁（价一百二十元）。二、帮助伯父，他的腿坏了，为了减轻农业社的负担，我们按时寄钱给他，保证了他的生活。三、买公债，全家已买了五百余元公债，计划今年再买二百五十元。四、存银行，这是为了支援国家建设，也是为了防备自己不时之需。
    对照着我家的生活，我觉得黄秀英实在是浪费，因为她只顾个人，不顾集体。
