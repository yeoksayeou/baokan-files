Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 23rd: Residents of Quanxin Lane in Chengdu have consistently persisted in patriotic health campaigns since 1952. They have now eliminated mosquitoes, flies, lice, fleas, and bedbugs, and have essentially eliminated sparrows and rats. For more than six years, there have been no outbreaks of infectious diseases such as dysentery, typhoid, or malaria, and the incidence of other diseases has also been significantly reduced. Now, every family here loves cleanliness, and everyone talks about hygiene. The masses have generally developed the habit of rinsing their mouths daily, and adults do not spit indiscriminately, while children do not urinate or defecate indiscriminately. In 1952, Quanxin Lane was awarded the honorary title of a National Model Hygiene Unit (Grade B), and it has consistently been a model hygiene unit in Chengdu over the years.

How does Quanxin Lane maintain a regular patriotic health movement? Firstly, the residents here have established a system of studying hygiene knowledge once a week, which has continued uninterrupted for six years. In addition to personnel from the epidemic prevention station regularly giving them lessons, the masses also organize themselves to study hygiene and scientific knowledge from newspapers and periodicals, as well as advanced experiences from other places. Secondly, the Quanxin Lane Residents' Committee, based on the characteristics of the Quanxin Lane residents being all manual laborers with many passersby, has established a simple yet reasonable set of hygiene rules: sweep indoors and outdoors twice daily, conduct a major cleaning once a week, dredge drainage ditches six times a year, and usually clean during the morning and evening hours when residents are not working. This suits the masses' long-standing habit of cleaning in the morning and evening and does not affect their work, making it very easy to implement. For public area hygiene, they have adopted the "broom moves along" method, where person A passes the broom to person B after cleaning, who then passes it to person C, and so on in rotation. As a result, the "three no-responsibility" areas, which were previously the most difficult to keep clean, can now also be kept clean.

In addition, the men, women, old, and young in Quanxin Lane have all been organized to participate in health work. The elderly participate in family hygiene groups, strong adult men and women participate in environmental hygiene groups, teenagers form "eliminate the four pests" commando teams, and children form fly-catching teams. All residents have rat-catching tools and are engaged in rat-catching all year round. Since the second half of last year, rats have essentially disappeared here. When new residents move into Quanxin Lane, the director of the Residents' Committee and the masses will separately inform them of the hygiene regulations established in Quanxin Lane, how the masses usually pay attention to hygiene, and at the same time, they will also take them to see the sanitary conditions of other families.

### 家家爱清洁　人人讲卫生  成都全心巷六年如一日

    家家爱清洁　人人讲卫生
    成都全心巷六年如一日
    据新华社成都23日电　成都市全心巷的居民从1952年以来一直坚持爱国卫生工作，现在已经消灭了蚊子、苍蝇、虱子、跳蚤和臭虫，基本上消灭了麻雀和老鼠。六年多来，这里没有发生过痢疾、伤寒、疟疾等传染病，其他疾病的发病率也大大降低。这里现在家家爱清洁，人人讲卫生，群众普遍养成了每日漱口和大人不随地吐痰，小孩不随地便溺的习惯。1952年，全心巷曾获得全国乙等卫生模范的光荣称号，历年来它也一直是成都市的卫生模范单位。
    全心巷怎样使爱国卫生运动经常化呢？首先是这里的居民群众订立了每周学习一次卫生知识的制度，六年来一直没有间断。除了防疫站的人员经常给他们上课外，群众还自行组织起来学习报刊上的卫生科学知识，以及其他地方的先进经验。其次是全心巷居民委员会根据全心巷的居民全是体力劳动者和来往行人多的特点，订立了一套既简单又合理的卫生制度：室内外每日清扫两次，每周大扫除一次，每年疏淘阴沟六次，平时打扫都利用早晚居民无工作的时间。这样，既适合群众历来就有的早晚打扫清洁的习惯，也不影响群众的工作，执行起来非常顺利。公共地方的卫生工作他们采取了“扫帚赶路”的办法，就是由甲在打扫后，把扫帚交给乙，乙又把扫帚交给丙，依次轮流。这样，过去清洁卫生最难保持的“三不管”地方，现在也能保持清洁了。
    另外，全心巷的男女老少都被组织起来参加了卫生工作。老年人参加家庭卫生组，体力强的成年男女参加环境卫生组，青少年组成除四害突击队，儿童组成捕蝇队。所有的居民都置有捕鼠工具，一年四季都在捕鼠。从去年下半年起，这里老鼠基本上绝迹了。新迁户一搬进全心巷后，居民委员会主任和群众都要分头去告诉他们全心巷建立了哪些卫生制度，平时群众是如何讲究卫生的，同时，还要引他们去参观别家的卫生情况。
