    Launch the "Ten Thousand Households, One Million Rats and Sparrows" Campaign
    Tunliu County to Become a "Four-Without" County This Year

    (Our dispatch) Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, aims to become a "four-without" county in 1958. This was a resolution made at the Tunliu County Active Elements Congress for Eliminating the Four Pests in late December of last year.

    Tunliu County's campaign to eliminate the four pests has been continuously carried out since 1955. Last year, the county captured and killed over 250,000 rats and sparrows, dug up over 500 catties of pupae, and produced fifty-seven "four-without" townships, communes, and villages, including Dongligao Township and Xucun. More than six hundred heroes and activists in eliminating the four pests emerged. Guo Yuelai, known as the sparrow-killing hero, has already achieved the remarkable result of eliminating 20,000 sparrows. Zhang Fusheng, a 79-year-old commune member from Longzhaigou, also refused to admit he was old. In the past two months, he eliminated 312 rats, leading the entire village to be basically rat-free. The county's health section chief said that Tunliu County has already achieved a situation where every township has typical examples, every commune has models, and every team has active elements.

    The Tunliu County Active Elements Congress for Eliminating the Four Pests was convened to launch an even larger-scale high tide in eliminating the four pests. One hundred and thirty-three representatives of active elements in eliminating the four pests and other fields attended the meeting. Representatives from various counties in the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province also participated in the meeting, led by the Deputy Commissioner. During the meeting, the representatives extensively exchanged advanced experiences in eliminating the four pests and conducted on-site visits to the famous "four-without" township – Dongligao Township, greatly boosting the representatives' confidence in eradicating the four pests. At the meeting, Heshenmiao Township proposed to achieve a "four-without" status for the entire township before the Spring Festival, Zhangdian Township aimed to eliminate the four pests in April of this year, and Yuwu and thirteen other townships planned to complete the task of eliminating the four pests in June of this year.

    In order to achieve the glorious task of transforming Tunliu into a "four-without" county in 1958, the meeting decided to immediately launch the "Ten Thousand Households, One Million Rats and Sparrows" campaign throughout the county and studied specific implementation measures: (1) Each township and commune should revise its plan for eliminating the four pests based on the requirements of the congress; (2) The health departments will be responsible for training core elements in eliminating the four pests in separate areas; (3) Agricultural cooperatives should appropriately solve the problem of tools and medicines for eliminating the four pests in conjunction with manure accumulation;
  (4) Organize observation and comparison activities in due course.

    掀起“万户百万只”捕鼠灭雀运动
    屯留县今年要变成四无县
    本报讯　山西省屯留县要在1958年变成四无县。这是去年12月下旬屯留县除四害积极分子代表大会上作的一项决议。
    屯留县除四害运动是在1955年的基础上持续开展起来的。去年全县已捕鼠灭雀二十五万余只，挖蛹五百余斤，出现了东李高乡、许村等五十七个四无乡、社、村，涌现出六百多名除四害英雄和积极分子。被人称做灭雀英雄的郭月来已经取得灭雀两万只的巨大战果。龙爪沟七十九岁的老社员张福生也不服老，他在最近两个月中，消灭了三百一十二只老鼠，带动全村做到基本上没有老鼠。这个县的卫生科长说，屯留县已经做到乡乡有典型、社社有模范、队队有积极分子。
    屯留县除四害积极分子大会是为了掀起一个更大规模的除四害高潮而召开的。出席这次会议的有除四害和其他方面的积极分子代表一百三十三名，山西省长治专区各县均派代表在副专员率领下参加了这次会议。会议期间，代表们广泛交流了除四害的先进经验，并且到著名的四无乡——东李高乡进行了实地参观，大大地鼓舞了代表们灭尽四害的信心。在会上，河神庙乡提出在春节前全乡做到四无，张店乡要在今年4月消灭四害，余吾等十三个乡要在今年6月完成除四害任务。
    为了实现1958年屯留变为四无县这个光荣任务，会议决定立即在全县范围内掀起“万户百万只”捕鼠灭雀运动，并且研究了具体实施办法：（1）各乡、社根据大会要求，重新修订除四害规划；（2）卫生部门分片负责训练除四害骨干分子；（3）农业社结合积肥适当解决除四害的工具和用药问题；
  （4）适时组织观摩评比。
