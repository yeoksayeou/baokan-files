Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: The cotton unified purchase situation in China in 1957 was good. Currently, ten provinces including Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Anhui, have overfulfilled the 1957 cotton unified purchase tasks ahead of schedule. As of the end of last year, the country had collectively purchased more than 25 million dan of cotton, an increase of more than 34.6% compared to the same period in 1956, and an increase of 16.79% compared to the bumper harvest year of 1955.

According to inspections by relevant departments, the quality of cotton purchased in 1957 was very good, mostly grade three and grade four cotton, with some grade two cotton. The length of cotton fiber is generally about one-sixteenth longer than in 1956, the ginning outturn of seed cotton has also increased to varying degrees, and the moisture content is generally about 2% lower than the cotton in 1956.

The rapid progress and good quality of the unified cotton purchase in 1957 were the result of the unprecedented cotton harvest last year and the socialist great debate carried out in the vast rural areas. In 1957, the total national output of ginned cotton reached more than 32 million dan, exceeding the target for the last year of the First Five-Year Plan. In that year, the national planting area of high-yielding Dai-character cotton reached 40 million mu, accounting for more than 45% of the total cotton planting area, an increase of more than 14 million mu compared to 1956.

The person in charge of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives told reporters: In addition to the amount of cotton already purchased by the state and the amount retained by farmers, there are approximately 3 million dan of commodity cotton that have not been purchased. Based on this situation, it is not only possible but also necessary to purchase more cotton this year. The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives will, in accordance with the recent instructions from the State Council to appropriately increase this year's cotton purchase tasks, add purchase tasks to the cotton-producing provinces and cities.

    十个省统购棉花又多又好
    各产棉地区今年还要多购一些商品棉
    据新华社17日讯　1957年度我国棉花统购情况良好。目前河北、山西、陕西、河南、湖北、湖南、江西、四川、浙江、安徽十个省，已提前超额完成1957年度棉花统购任务。截至去年年底，全国共统购棉花二千五百多万担，比1956年同期增加34.6％以上，比丰收的1955年同期增加16.79％。
    据有关部门检验，1957年度统购的棉花质量很好，大都是三级、四级棉，还有部分是二级棉。棉花纤维的长度一般要比1956年长十六分之一左右，籽棉的衣分率也有不同程度的提高，水分一般要比1956年的棉花降低2％左右。
    1957年度棉花统购进度快、质量好，是去年棉花空前丰收和广大农村开展社会主义大辩论的结果。1957年全国皮棉总产量达到三千二百多万担，超额完成了第一个五年计划最后一年的指标。这一年全国播种产量高的岱字棉达四千万亩，占棉花播种总面积的45％以上，比1956年增加一千四百多万亩。
    全国供销合作总社负责人对记者说：全国棉花总产量除了国家已经统购和农民自留的数量以外，大约还有三百万担商品棉没有收购起来。根据这一情况，本年度多统购一些棉花不但是可能的，而且是应该的。全国供销合作总社将根据国务院最近发出的适当提高本年度棉花统购任务的指示，向各产棉省、市追加统购任务。
