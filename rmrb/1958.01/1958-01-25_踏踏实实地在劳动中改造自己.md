    Conscientiously Remold Oneself Through Labor
    Ye Mai
    The call to go down to the countryside and up to the mountains to participate in labor training has stirred up tumultuous waves in the hearts of many intellectuals. Since sending large numbers of cadres to the countryside is both to support rural construction and accelerate the realization of agricultural modernization, and also to remold intellectuals, thereby establishing a cadre force with firm stance, wholeheartedly serving the people, and able to withstand risks, who wouldn't want to throw themselves into this revolutionary action of transforming oneself, transforming history, and transforming nature? Thus, we see batches of comrades who deeply understand righteousness (socialism), resolutely and bravely heading to the labor battlefield. "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." It is foreseeable that comrades with firm will and a correct starting point will be tempered into steel in the crucible of labor and life.
    However, not all comrades went down with a deep understanding of righteousness. Among the large number of cadres sent down, many comrades, while having some understanding of the meaning of participating in labor and holding a resolute attitude, also carried a lot of personal baggage in their minds. For example, some went to the countryside with a hunting-for-romance and novelty-seeking mentality, preparing to "experience" life and become a "pastoral poet" or "pastoral painter" in the future; some wanted to "prepare a flute, herd a flock of sheep, ride a horse," and enjoy the scenery of nature in their spare time from labor, living a leisurely and poetic life. There were countless ideas.
    These comrades' ideas differed, but they all pointed to the same thing. They had not truly stepped down from the throne of the petty-bourgeois kingdom, determined to live and breathe with the working people, and integrate their thoughts and feelings with the working people, but instead allowed their individualistic thoughts and the fantasies peculiar to intellectuals to run wild. Therefore, after taking the first step on the road of labor, they shrank back. Fantasies gnawed at their hearts, and labor life did not stir their enthusiasm and joy. They either turned a blind eye, turned a deaf ear, staggering and hesitating behind life; or even faced with the "monotonous and heavy" labor day after day, their beautiful fantasies shattered, with some disappointment, some distress, and some pessimism.
    A young comrade who had been in the countryside for a few months once confessed: "Before coming to the agricultural cooperative, I thought that the life of the agricultural cooperative was so fiery, there were so many moving stories inside, so many excellent figures of the diligent and thrifty new countryside. When I came to the countryside, I saw that the reality was not like that." This comrade wanted to go to the countryside to "experience" life and stimulate creative emotions, but "he understood little about the situation, things could not excite him, and there was too much physical labor, which hindered the experience of life." Thus, he began to feel distressed, depressed, and at a loss as to what to do.
    What to do? Retreating would bring ridicule, which is naturally not desirable; but if one does not abandon all unrealistic fantasies and labor honestly, one cannot take another step forward on the road of labor training.
    Perhaps these comrades think that their ideas are ideals rather than fantasies. A young comrade who felt distressed after participating in labor once exclaimed: "Saying that I am pessimistic, disappointed, complaining, and dissatisfied, I firmly do not accept it. Young people all have lofty ideals, who doesn't want to do a great and earth-shattering career in the golden age of youth? I am a person full of ideals and constantly moving forward on the right path, unwilling to spend my life in vain but willing to bring glory to the motherland." Yes, young people generally have some extraordinary ambitions, which is not only not objectionable but should be commended. We are doing things that predecessors have never done, and without vigor and ideals, our cause cannot move forward. Therefore, not only young people should have "lofty ideals," but also middle-aged and old people should have them. However, personal ideals must be combined with the collective cause and ideals; and they must also have the possibility of realization, otherwise they will become empty fantasies. Judging from the current ideological situation of these comrades, their various ideas are clearly nothing more than illusory fantasies. This is because, whether they want to be poets or writers, or do a great and earth-shattering career, none of these can be achieved by those who only have a beautiful wish but do not want to engage in labor practice. Any great and earth-shattering career can only be realized on the basis of the extremely small and trivial things done by millions of people, and on the basis of the practice of the masses of the people (including the creative practice of the comrades who want to be writers and the ordinary labor practice that they look down upon). Therefore, Lenin once taught us that in work, we should never refuse small things, because great things are accumulated from small things. However, the comrades with great ambitions mentioned above, neither understand that "labor is a kind of creation," and that "it is labor that constitutes all the most precious, beautiful, and great things in this world" (Gorky's words), nor do they understand that engaging in agricultural labor is first of all to transform oneself into a noble person, and secondly, it can lay a foundation for the cause they envision. Therefore, they are unwilling to labor honestly and retreat in the first round, so their grand ambitions and bold words have lost the possibility and foundation of realization. As the saying goes, exaggerated words are difficult to carry out, and ambition is extremely high but the heart is not focused. The grand wishes set by these comrades are just like the rich fool in the Hundred Parables Sutra who wanted to build the third floor before building the first two floors, which is empty. What are empty grand wishes if not fantasies? Moreover, their so-called ideals are somewhat selfish and self-interested, and run counter to the overall cause and the Party's requirements for intellectuals to participate in labor training.
    Young comrades generally have a short life experience, going from family to school to institutions, and rarely come into contact with reality, so they inevitably have some naive fantasies. This is understandable and not terrible. After coming into contact with reality, they will gradually correct themselves. What is terrible is that young people are infected with the egoistic fantasies of the old intellectuals. Loving fantasies is a common ailment of old intellectuals. Gorky once said that intellectuals exist between the hammer of the bourgeoisie and the anvil of the working people. It is precisely because they are in this "between" that the wavering and unstable social status of the old intellectuals is determined. They are educated by the bourgeoisie, serve the bourgeoisie, and eat the bourgeoisie's food. "Cattle know the rich man's pen, and donkeys recognize the master's trough," so they look up to the bourgeoisie's breath and cling to the bourgeoisie. And what about the working people? They look down upon them a thousand times and are unwilling to depend on them. But the "hammer" often presses them on the "anvil," that is, throws them to the side of the working people. "There is no way to climb the green wall," and they are unwilling to lose their status as "people above people," so the wings of "fantasy" are spread out in this "between." And because their status is wavering and unstable, fantasies are easily germinated, easily shattered, and revived after being destroyed, which is very stubborn. Some characteristics of intellectuals, such as selfish and self-interested individualism, arrogance, conceit, laziness, detachment from the masses, detachment from reality, etc., are all formed along with their social status. As Gorky said, intellectuals "often have a concept that the captured thought of intellectuals extends the difficulties and inconveniences of the conditions of their own position to the entire world, and as a result of the subjective world feeling, philosophical pessimism, skepticism in daily life, and other deformed thoughts appear."
    Now the social status of intellectuals has changed, but because consciousness lags behind existence, some characteristics formed by intellectuals in the past are still retained in general old intellectuals, and even young intellectuals are inevitably stained with some of this dust. And the role of intellectuals' fantasies today is to escape and even resist ideological remolding. Therefore, we see that some comrades who go to the countryside, before going to the countryside, superficially mythologize labor, thinking of the countryside as so beautiful, and lack ideological preparation for arduous labor to transform themselves; after going to the countryside, the life that is originally extremely fiery, they feel ordinary and unremarkable, the great cause that is originally earth-shattering, they feel nothing, indifferent: because no matter how enthusiastic the life is, or how great the cause is, it is incompatible with their selfish and self-interested purposes. Actual life is naturally difficult to satisfy their wishes, and if they are slightly dissatisfied, they will produce the sorrow of disillusionment; or when encountering difficulties, they lack the perseverance to overcome them. Participating in labor training was originally to overcome the individualism and nihilistic thoughts of intellectuals, but some comrades use these thoughts to deal with it, which also shows the urgency and necessity of intellectuals remolding themselves in labor.
    The feeling of disillusionment is also often produced by seeing some shortcomings in reality. Our countryside is undergoing a transformation from the old to the new, the situation is still more complicated, and it is not so beautiful. The labor conditions are also more backward. The peasants themselves also have some shortcomings. When you first arrive in the countryside, there are naturally many aspects that you are not accustomed to, or even cannot stand. The young man mentioned above once said: "The peasants all shield each other, are jealous of each other, attack each other, annoy each other, are selfish and self-interested, arrogant and conceited, speak rudely, are extremely low-level, quarrel and fight, are passively lazy, choose easy jobs and are afraid of hard ones, and do not pay attention to hygiene." It's really a list of sins, beyond redemption. He also said: "If I keep doing this, what can I learn? What progress can I make? What kind of person can I become in the future?" He was confused. But he also raised the question of what to learn from the peasants and how to view the shortcomings of the peasants.
    This comrade's experience cannot help but remind people of the situation of the 19th-century Russian Populist intellectuals "going to the people." The Populists regarded the masses of the people as "rabble," as "a pile of countless zeros," and regarded themselves as heroes, as "the meaningful unit in front of countless zeros." They went to the people with this point of view to "liberate" the peasants. But they did not understand the psychology of the peasants and were incompatible with the peasants, so the peasants were cold to them, distrusted them, ridiculed them as useless scholars, and even harbored hostility towards them. And they also felt that the peasants were stupid, rude, superstitious, and their lives were monotonous, feeling oppressed and suffocated, and even feeling that they were insulted, hurt, and made sacrifices. Thus, they "scattered with wounded hearts, with some open contempt for each other." Although the intellectuals and peasants of the two eras are not the same, and the purpose of the Populists going to the people and the significance of our going down to the countryside and up to the mountains are also very different, we can get some lessons from the Populists' experience of "going to the people." First of all, the "master" point of view and attitude of the Populists is absolutely unacceptable. Unlike the Populists, our first task in going down to the countryside and up to the mountains is to learn from the peasants, to first see the advantages of the peasants and learn the essential things of the peasants, rather than first educating the peasants and only seeing the shortcomings of the peasants, that is, the non-essential things.
    The so-called learning from the peasants and participating in labor training is nothing more than cultivating a labor viewpoint and a mass viewpoint in the process of labor. And just developing a correct labor viewpoint is not easy for intellectuals who are accustomed to living in comfort and despise physical labor. This requires a difficult process of tempering. Countless times of sore back and legs, swollen shoulders and red hands - "from slender hands to hands full of calluses" - can exchange for a true knowledge of "labor is a kind of creation," and dare not easily say that physical labor is not promising. A comrade has already experienced this: when he learned that a soybean needs fifteen production processes from seed selection to harvest, he realized the true meaning of "every grain is hard-earned," realized that the peasants have the excellent qualities of diligence and simplicity, and how disgusting the arrogance and vanity of ordinary intellectuals are. But this is only the beginning of the transformation of thoughts and feelings. To seek a fundamental transformation, one must learn the various strengths of the peasants anytime, anywhere, and with all one's heart. Shi Youzhen, an old farmer in Huanghua Township, Lin County, passed on four experiences to the cadres who were sent down: be diligent with your mouth, ask if you don't know; be diligent with your eyes, be observant when working, learn as you go; be diligent with your hands, "practice makes perfect"; more importantly, be not afraid of suffering, not afraid of difficulties, "three days of arms and two days of shoulders, thick calluses after blisters on your hands." In just a few words, he taught the learning methods and also revealed the excellent qualities of love for labor, diligence and humility, no airs, wisdom and creativity, and perseverance to overcome difficulties that are contained in the peasants. Only by learning these excellent qualities of the peasants, and only by putting in the effort as Shi Youzhen said, can one bathe one's heart in the sweat of labor, wash away the old and eliminate the wrong, and establish the thought and feelings of loving labor and loving the working people. And if one can love the working people, one will naturally have a mass viewpoint, and one will be able to clearly distinguish between love and hate, love what the working people love, and hate what the working people hate. Therefore, learning the peasants' love for labor is a red line for learning from the peasants, and it should be run through the entire process of training and transforming oneself.
    Secondly, the peasants were small producers in the past, and were long influenced by the ideology of the exploiting classes, and they do have shortcomings such as individualism, selfishness and self-interest. But these shortcomings are not terrible, and there is no need to be discouraged like the Populists, and retreat from confusion back to one's own original small circle. An analytical attitude should be adopted towards the shortcomings of the peasants. With the increasing consolidation of rural cooperatives and the gradual improvement of the peasants' cultural level, the excellent qualities of the peasants are increasing and developing; the shortcomings of the peasants are gradually being overcome and transformed. As Ehrenburg said, "There are also stubborn remnants of old things in our society, but can the dry leaves of last year cover the green grass of spring?" This change and progress should be seen first. At the same time, in the process of this struggle between the new and the old among the peasants, can the intellectuals who are sent down frown upon seeing some shortcomings of the peasants, and even show confusion and disappointment? No, we have the responsibility to help and educate. In fact, some of the shortcomings of the peasants mostly exist in the intellectuals, so there is no need for the crow to laugh at the phoenix, unaware of one's own ugliness, when seeing some shortcomings of the peasants. If you examine yourself with the spirit of introspection and be vigilant about yourself, then the shortcomings of the peasants can also become a positive factor in transforming our thinking.
    It can be seen that there are many things to learn from the peasants. The problem lies in what attitude one takes to learn. We should realize that going from the city to the countryside is only the starting point for transforming our own thinking, and it is not enough to have only a little determination at the beginning. We must abandon all fantasies, unconditionally and wholeheartedly go to labor, and be mentally prepared to be rebuffed, constantly consolidate our determination, carry forward the spirit of perseverance, and overcome all difficulties. Otherwise, one will return empty-handed after entering a treasure mountain. Chairman Mao said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "We hope that the intellectuals in our country will continue to move forward, gradually establish a communist world outlook in their work and study, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism well, gradually become one with the workers and peasants, and do not stop halfway, let alone retreat, there is no way out for retreating." The comrades who have already gone to the countryside and are preparing to go to the countryside should always remember Chairman Mao's words to encourage themselves and be vigilant about themselves.

    踏踏实实地在劳动中改造自己
    叶迈
    下乡上山参加劳动锻炼的号召，在一般知识分子的心灵深处，激起了波涛翻腾的浪花。既然下放大批干部到农村去，是为了支援农村建设，加速实现农业的现代化；同时也是为了改造知识分子，从而建立一支立场坚定的、全心全意为人民服务的、经得起风险的干部队伍；那末，谁不愿意投身于这个改造自己、改造历史、改造自然的革命行动中去呢？于是，我们看到成批深明大义（社会主义）的同志，毅然决然地、昂首挺胸地奔赴劳动战场。“千里之行始于足下”，可以预期，意志坚决而且持有正确出发点的同志，是会在劳动中，在生活的洪炉中，百炼成钢的。
    但是，并非所有的同志都是深晓大义才下去的。在大批下放干部中，也有不少同志，对参加劳动的意义虽有几分认识，态度倒也坚决，但思想中同时也夹带了不少私货。如有的人就带着一种猎艳搜奇的心情，想到农村去“体验”生活，准备将来做个“田园诗人”或“田园画家”；有的人想“预备一支笛子，赶上一群羊，骑上一匹马”，在劳动之余，领略一下大自然的风光，过着悠哉游哉，富有诗意的生活。种种想法，不一而足。
    这些同志的想法各自不同，其揆一也。他们还没有真正从小资产阶级王国的宝座上走下来，下决心与劳动人民同生活共呼吸，与劳动人民的思想感情打成一片，而是任其个人主义思想和知识分子所特具的幻想在驰骋。因之，他们在劳动的道路上跨出第一步以后，便畏缩不前了。幻想在啃啮着他们的心灵，劳动生活并不能激起他们的热情和欢乐。或视而不见，听而不闻，摇摇晃晃，踯躅在生活的后面；甚或在日复一日的“单调而沉重的”劳动面前，美妙的幻想破灭了，几分失望，几分苦恼，几分悲观。
    有一位下乡几个月的青年同志就曾作过这样的表白：“来到农业社之前，觉得农业社的生活不知道有多么火热，里面不知道有多少动人的事迹，有多少勤劳俭朴的新农村的优秀人物，到农村一看，实际不是那么回事。”这个同志是想到农村“体验”生活，激发创作情绪的，但“了解情况少，事情不能激动自己，体力劳动太多，有碍于对生活的体验”，于是，他开始苦恼、沉闷，惶惶然不知何以自处。
    何以自处？后退会惹人耻笑，自然不足取法；但若不抛开种种不切实际的幻想，老老实实的劳动，也就不能在劳动锻炼的路上再前进一步。
    也许这些同志认为他们的想法是理想而不是幻想。有一个在参加劳动后感到苦恼的青年同志，就曾叫喊道：“说我悲观失望，发牢骚，不满，我坚决不接受。青年人都有远大的理想，哪一个不想在黄金的青春时代做一番轰轰烈烈的事业呢？我是充满理想并一刻不停地向正确道路前进的人，不愿白白度过一生而是愿给祖国增光的人”。是的，一般青年人都有一些不同寻常的抱负，这不仅无可非议，而且应当嘉许。我们在做着前人未曾做过的事业，没有朝气，没有理想，就不能使我们的事业前进。所以不仅青年人应当有“远大的理想”，壮年人和老年人何尝不应当有？但个人的理想，一则要同集体的事业和理想结合起来；再则要有实现的可能性，否则就会变成架空的幻想。从目前这些同志的思想情况来看，显然他们的种种想法只不过是一些虚无飘渺的幻想。这因为，不管是他们想做的诗人或作家也罢，想做的轰轰烈烈的事业也罢，都不是那种徒具一个美好的愿望而不想从事劳动实践的人所可办得到的。任何轰轰烈烈的事业，都是在千百万人所做的极其微小琐屑的事情的基础上，在人民群众的实践（包括上面这些想当作家的同志的创作实践和他们所看不起的平凡的劳动实践）的基础上才能实现的。所以，列宁曾经教导我们，在工作中无论何时都不要拒绝小事情，因为大事是由小事积成的。可是，上面那些具有伟大抱负的同志，既不理解“劳动乃是一种创作”，“正是劳动才构成这世界上一切最珍贵、美好和伟大的东西的人”（高尔基语），也不理解从事农业劳动，首先是要改造自己成为高尚的人，其次也可为自己所设想的事业打下基础，因而不愿意老老实实的劳动，在第一个回合中就退却下来了，所以他们的宏愿和豪言壮语，也就失去了实现的可能性和基础。即所谓言夸大则实难行，志极高而心不专。这些同志所设的宏愿，也正像百喻经中那个富愚人不欲造下两层楼而先造第三层楼一样，是架空的。架空的宏愿，非幻想而何？更何况，他们的所谓理想，都多少带有一些自私自利的性质，和总的事业，和党对知识分子参加劳动锻炼的要求是背道而驰的。
    一般青年同志由于生活历程很短，由家庭而学校而机关，很少接触实际，所以不免有一些天真的幻想。情有可原，也不可怕，接触实际之后，自会逐渐矫正。可怕的是，青年人染上旧知识分子那种利己主义的幻想。爱幻想正是旧知识分子的一种通病。高尔基曾经说过，知识分子是存在于资产阶级的铁锤与劳动人民的铁砧之间的。正因为是在这个“之间”，这就决定了旧知识分子七上八下、动摇不定的社会地位。他们受资产阶级的教育，为资产阶级服务，吃资产阶级的饭，“牛知富家栏，驴识主人槽”，于是他们就上仰资产阶级之鼻息，紧紧依附于资产阶级。而对劳动人民呢？一千个看不起，自不甘于依附。但“铁锤”往往又会把他们压在“铁砧”之上，即把他们抛于劳动人民一方面。“青壁无路难夤缘”，而又不愿失为“人上人”，“幻想”的翅膀也就在这个“之间”展开了。而且由于地位动摇不定，幻想也就容易萌生，容易破灭，灭而复萌，十分顽强。知识分子的一些特性，如自私自利的个人主义，骄傲自大、虚浮懒散、脱离群众、脱离实际等等，也都是伴随着他们的社会地位而形成的。正如高尔基所说的，知识分子“时常发生一种观念，就是知识分子的被俘虏的思想，把自己所处地位的条件的艰难和不方便，推广到整个世界，而在主观的世界感觉的结果，就出现了哲学上的悲观主义，日常生活里的怀疑主义，以及其它的畸形思想。”
    而今知识分子的社会地位变了，但由于意识落后于存在，知识分子往日形成的一些特性，也还多少保留在一般旧知识分子身上，就是青年知识分子，也不免沾染上一些这样的灰尘。而知识分子的幻想在今日的作用，就是逃避以至抗拒思想改造。因此，我们看到某些下乡的同志，在下乡之前，虚浮地神化劳动，把农村想得如此这般美妙，而缺乏艰苦劳动改造自己的思想准备；既下乡之后，本来是极火热的生活，他们却觉得平凡无奇，本来是轰轰烈烈的伟大事业，他们却觉得没有什么，无动于衷：因为无论多么热烈的生活，伟大的事业，都和他们的自私自利的目的格格不入。实际生活自然难于满足他们的愿望，而稍一不如愿，就产生了幻灭的悲哀；或则遇到困难，缺乏克服的毅力。参加劳动锻炼，原是为了克服知识分子的个人主义和虚无主义思想的，而有些同志反以这些思想来对之，也可见知识分子在劳动中改造自己的迫切性和必要性了。
    幻灭之感，也往往由于在现实中看到某些缺点而产生。我们的农村，正在经历由旧到新的转变，情况还较复杂，还不是那么美好。劳动条件也较落后。农民本身也还有一些缺点。乍到农村，自然会有很多方面不习惯，甚至看不顺眼。上面提到的那位青年就曾说道：“农民个个互相包庇，互相嫉妒，互相打击，互相气人，自私自利，自高自大，说话粗鲁，极端低级，吵嘴打架，消极怠工，干活拣轻怕重，还不讲卫生。”真是罪状累累，无以复加。他并且说道：“倘一直这样干下去，能学点什么哪？能有什么进步呢？将来能成个什么样的人哪？”他惶惑了。但他也提出了一个向农民学习什么和怎样看待农民的缺点的问题。
    这位同志的遭遇，不由得使人想起了十九世纪俄国民粹派知识分子“到民间去”的情形。民粹派把人民大众看作“群氓”，看作“一堆无数的零”，把自己看作英雄，看作“无数的零”前面的“有决定意义的单位”。他们就是带着这样一种观点到民间去“解放”农民的。但他们不了解农民的心理，和农民格格不入，所以农民对他们冷冰冰，不信任，讥笑他们是百无一用的书生，甚至对他们怀着敌意。而他们也觉得农民愚蠢，粗野，迷信，生活单调，感到压抑和窒息，甚至觉得自己被侮辱了，被伤害了，做了牺牲。于是，他们“带着心灵的创伤，散伙了，彼此怀着多少公然的蔑视。”虽然两个时代的知识分子和农民不可同日而语，民粹派到民间去的目的和我们下乡上山的意义也迥然不同，但我们从民粹派“到民间去”的遭遇里，是可以得到一些教益的。首先，民粹派那种“老爷”观点和态度是绝对要不得的。和民粹派不同，我们下乡上山，向农民学习是第一位的任务，要首先看到农民的优点，学习农民本质的东西，而不是首先教育农民，只看到农民的缺点，即非本质的东西。
    所谓向农民学习，参加劳动锻炼，无非是要在劳动过程中培养起劳动观点和群众观点。而单是养成一种正确的劳动观点，对于惯于养尊处优、轻视体力劳动的知识分子来说，虽非难事，也颇不易。这是需要一个艰苦磨炼的过程的。无数次的腰酸腿疼，肩肿手红——“由纤纤双手到满手老茧”，方能换得来一个“劳动乃是一种创作”的真知识，而不敢轻易道个体力劳动没有出息。有一位同志已经体验到了这点：当他了解到一粒大豆从选种到收获需要十五个生产过程后，方才体会到“粒粒皆辛苦”的真实涵义，体会到农民具有勤劳朴实的优良品质，而一般知识分子的骄夸虚浮又多么可厌。但这还只是思想感情在开始转变，要求得一个根本的转变，还得随时随地、刻心刻意地学习农民的各种长处。林县黄华乡老农石友珍，向下放干部传授了四条经验：嘴要勤，不会就问；眼要勤，干活要有眼色，随作随学；手要勤，“熟能生巧”；更重要的是，要不怕吃苦，不怕困难，“三天胳臂两天肩，手起泡后结厚茧”。短短几句话，教给了学习方法，也道出了农民身上所蕴藏着的热爱劳动，勤恳虚心，不摆架子，具有智慧和创造性，具有克服困难的毅力等等优良品质。只有学习农民的这些优良品质，也只有像石友珍说的那样去用工夫，才能在劳动的汗水中沐浴自己的心灵，涤旧去非，建立热爱劳动，热爱劳动人民的思想感情。而能够热爱劳动人民，自然也就有了群众观点，也就能够爱憎了了分明，好劳动人民之所好，恶劳动人民之所恶。所以，学习农民热爱劳动的品质，是向农民学习的一根红线，应当把它贯穿在整个锻炼、改造自己的过程中。
    其次，农民过去是小生产者，长期受着剥削阶级的思想影响，也的确有个人主义、自私自利等缺点。但这些缺点并不可怕，也不必像民粹派那样灰心丧志，由困惑而退回到自己原来的小圈子里去。对于农民的缺点，应当采取分析的态度。随着农村合作化的日益巩固和农民文化水平的逐步提高，农民的优良品质正在日益增多和发扬；农民的缺点正在逐渐克服和转变。正如爱伦堡所说的，“我们的社会里也有旧事物的顽固的残余，但去年的枯叶，能掩盖春天的青草吗？”这种变化和前进，是应当首先看到的一点。同时，在农民的这种新旧斗争的过程中，难道下放的知识分子看到农民有一些缺点可以嫉首蹙额以至表现惶惑失望吗？不能，我们有帮助和教育的责任。其实，农民身上的一些缺点，大抵都存在于知识分子的身上，所以看到农民的一些缺点，也不必乌鸦笑凤凰，自丑不觉。如果用反求诸己的精神来检查自己，警惕自己，那末，农民的缺点，也可以成为我们改造思想的一种积极因素。
    可见向农民可学的东西是很多的，问题在于自己抱什么态度去学习。我们应当认识到，从城市走到农村，这只是改造自己思想的起点，仅有刚刚下去时的一点决心还是很不够的。必须抛掉一切幻想，无条件地、全心全意地到劳动中去，并且要有碰一鼻子灰的思想准备，不断巩固自己的决心，发扬坚韧的精神，克服一切困难。不然，则将会深入宝山空手而返的。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中说：“我们希望我国的知识分子继续前进，在自己的工作和学习的过程中，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，而不要中途停顿，更不要向后倒退，倒退是没有出路的。”已经下乡的和正在准备下乡的同志们，是应当时时刻刻记住毛主席这句话来勉励自己、警惕自己的。
