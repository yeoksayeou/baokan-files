    Biography of Chairman Groza

    Petru Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of Romania, is an outstanding Romanian statesman and political activist. He was born on December 6, 1884, in Transylvania (now known as Cluj County), and was educated at universities in Budapest, Berlin, Leipzig, and others. In his youth, Groza joined the Romanian Youth League and engaged in political activities against the oppression of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1918, Groza was elected as a representative to the Constitutional Assembly of Transylvania. From 1920 to 1927, he was elected five times as a member of the Romanian Parliament as a candidate of the People's Party, and served as a minister in the government several times. In 1927, Groza left the People's Party. In 1933, he led the "Farmers' Front." During the era of fascist reactionary rule and World War II, the "Farmers' Front" led by Groza accepted the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party and fought against turning Romania into a vassal of Hitler's Germany and to withdraw Romania from the Hitlerite alliance. Groza was arrested in 1943 and released from prison in early 1944.

    After the Soviet Red Army liberated Romania in August 1944, Groza actively participated in the activities of the National Democratic Front under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party. From November 1944 to February 1945, Groza served as Deputy Prime Minister in the Sănătescu and Rădescu governments. In these two governments, he opposed the reactionaries and implemented policies that embodied the will of the working people and were friendly to the Soviet Union. In March 1945, he also participated in the struggle initiated by the Romanian Communist Party to overthrow the Rădescu government and led the subsequent establishment of the Democratic United Government. On December 30, 1947, when the Romanian People's Republic was founded, Groza served as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic. In June 1952, he was elected Chairman of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic, and re-elected in March 1957.

    Chairman Groza visited our country for more than a month in 1954 at the invitation of Chairman Mao Zedong. After returning to his country, he wrote the book "Visiting a Country with 600 Million People," praising the achievements made in various aspects of social reform in our country.
