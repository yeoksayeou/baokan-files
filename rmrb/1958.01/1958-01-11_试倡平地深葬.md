Article 30 of the National Agricultural Development Program has provisions for "guaranteed burial"; the recently announced National Construction Land Requisition Measures, Article 16, also has provisions for dealing with graves. This issue is worth noting.

Guaranteeing burial is indeed as important as guaranteeing food, clothing, burning (funeral arrangements), and education. However, the issue of "burial" involves questions of how to bury and where to bury.

Generally, burial is in the soil. A good piece of arable land is sacrificed for the sake of the dead. In feudal times, needless to say, later, general bureaucrats, capitalists, and big landlords, to show off their extravagance, would pile up graves very, very high, leaving a lot of space around them, planting some cypress-like trees, and leaving some of it barren. "Countless earthen mounds outside the city, inside the city are all stuffed buns." These two lines of poetry reflect the general farmers' resentment and curses under this situation. The situation of ethnic minorities is somewhat different, but almost everywhere in the areas inhabited by the general Han people, it is like this.

Since liberation, after the "land reform" and the establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives, the countryside has gradually changed its appearance. News comes that a certain grave has been dug up, and a certain family's grave has been leveled. It should be considered not a big problem. But it is best to have appropriate handling methods.

The general approach is to favor public cemeteries. Public cemeteries take up less land. But if they are set up on flat ground, they will still take up some arable land; if they are set up in mountainous areas, mountainous areas can be afforested or planted with other mountainous plants, but they will still take up some productive land.

The fundamental solution is to abandon burial and cremate! Some ethnic groups and some religions are accustomed to cremation. However, from the perspective of the broad masses of people, the practice of cremation is still slowly unfolding, and some relatives of the deceased inevitably have some ideological problems. They can't get over the thought of burning their loved ones to ashes. In reality, what is the difference between burning in a fire and rotting in the soil? Thinking will slowly be straightened out. The problem is that cremation requires considerable equipment, and it is not easy to promote it universally all at once. Therefore, I propose a very simple method: a relatively easy method is deep burial on level ground.

The method is still burial. That is, to bury the corpse deep, deep to one and a half meters or even deeper. The surface is level ground, without piling up an earthen mound. I have consulted some farmers about this method: in this way, the dead are buried underground, and the ground can still be planted as usual, is that okay? The answer was: yes. In this way, it greatly saves expenses and trouble, and the land can still be cultivated as usual.

If the relatives of the deceased have already become enlightened, even the coffin can be dispensed with. Even if the deceased wears clothes, just wear the usual ones, that's fine. There is no need to specially make them, as they will rot anyway.

I think the old gentlemen among the intellectuals should also agree. Confucius did not say "desire for quick decay after death"? And in ancient times, there was a burial method without mounds and without trees. No mounds and no trees means level ground, and those who have read a little old book know this.

One point needs to be explained, it is possible that there is water underground, and deep burial may come into contact with water. I don't think it matters much, some even use the "water burial" method! I think no one will be superstitious about "feng shui" anymore! Saying that the dead encounter wind and water underground, and the living descendants will be adversely affected on the ground is too ridiculous.

This method may be suitable for dealing with general grave problems in the near future. Just bury the coffin deeper, flatten the ground, and it is a good piece of arable land.

I think public cemeteries can also consider adopting this method of deep burial on level ground. Regardless of public or private cemeteries, as long as everyone highly values arable land, and puts the importance of increasing national agricultural production first; at the same time, as descendants, they give up the idea of building their ancestors' graves high and grand to show off to relatives and neighbors this feudal remnant, then it will be good.

In order to try to realize my proposal, I have already, with the consent of my whole family, leveled and deeply buried my family's ancestral graves, and donated the land to the cooperative for planting, making it the property of the commune.

It must be stated that if cremation facilities are available, cremation is of course very good.

The meaning of "guaranteed burial" is too good. This method of deep burial on level ground may be able to solve the problem of "burial" in some places. There is a popular saying in our hometown: "Entering the soil brings peace," doesn't entering the soil even deeper bring even more peace! But this issue is of a general nature, so I make this public suggestion.

Seeing that China's agricultural productivity is developing year by year and the value of land is increasing year by year, we should not allow good arable land to be wasted for burying the dead.

    试倡平地深葬
    黄炎培
    全国农业发展纲要第三十条有“保葬”的规定；最近公布的国家建设征用土地办法第十六条也有处理坟墓问题的规定，这问题是值得注意。
    保葬确是和保吃、保穿、保烧、保教同样重要。只是“葬”这件事情上边，存在着怎么样葬，葬在什么地方这类问题。
    一般葬在土里。把一片很好的可耕地，为这个死人而牺牲生产。封建时代不用说了，到后来，一般官僚、资本家、大地主表示豪阔，也把坟地堆得很高很高，四面留着很多的余地，一部分种松柏类的树木，一部分还荒着。“城外无数土馒头，城中尽是馒头馅”。这两句诗，反映着一般农民在这种情况下一片怨恨和诅咒。少数民族情况有所不同，一般汉族人民所在地几乎到处是这样。
    解放以来，经过了“土改”，成立了农业生产合作社，农村一步步改变了面貌。消息传来，某处坟墓被掘掉了，某家坟墓被爬平了，应该认为不是大问题。但最好要有适当的处理方法。
    处理方法，一般倾向于公墓。公墓占地少些。但如设在平地上，还要占去多少可耕地；设在山区，山区可以造林，或种其他山区植物，还是占去一部分生产地。
    根本解决，不要土葬了，火葬吧！有些民族，有些宗教，是习惯火葬的。只是从广大的民众说来，火葬的风气还在慢慢地展开，有些死者家属思想上还不免有些问题，把亲人烧成灰，心上过不去。实际上火里烧掉，同土里烂掉有多少分别呢？思想是会慢慢地搞通的。问题倒是在火葬要有相当的设备，一下子不容易普遍地推行。因此，我提出一个很简便的方法：比较容易办的，就是平地深葬。
    方法还是土葬。就是把死尸埋得深，深到一公尺半或更深些。面上就是平地，不要堆起一个土馒头来。我曾把这个方法向部分农民们请教：这样，死人埋在地下，地面照常种东西，行不行？答称：行。这样，大大地省费、省事，地照常可以种。
    如果死者家属的思想已经开通的话，连棺槨都可以省掉。死人即使穿衣服，就平常穿的，好了。用不着特制，横竖是烂掉的。
    我想知识分子中老先生们，也应该赞成的，孔夫子不是说过“死欲其速朽”。并且古时原有不封不树的葬法。不封不树就是平地，读过一点旧书的，都知道的。
    有一点要说明，可能地下有水，深葬可能接触到水。我认为没有多大关系，有些还采用“水葬”方法哩！我想今后再没有人迷信“风水”了吧！说：死人在地下遇到了风和水，活着的子孙在地上会受到不利的影响，太可笑了。
    这方法也许适用于处理眼前的一般坟墓问题。只须把棺埋深一下，地铲平一下，就是一片很好的耕地。
    我以为公墓也可以考虑采用这平地深葬方法。不管公墓、私墓，只要大家高度重视可耕的土地，把国家农业生产增加的重要放在第一位；同时做子孙的放弃他们把祖宗的坟墓建设得高大堂皇，向亲邻夸耀这种封建残余的思想，那就好了。
    为了尝试地实现我的主张，我已经把我家历代祖坟，经过全家同意，平地深葬完毕，把地赠给合作社种，成为社有。
    必须说明，如果在火葬条件具备的地方，火葬当然是很好。
    “保葬”的意思太好了。这平地深葬法，也许在某些地方能够解决这“葬”的问题。我们的家乡有一句流行的俗语：“入土为安”，入土更深，不更安么！但是这问题近乎一般性的，所以公开建议。
    看到全中国农业生产力一年一年不断发展，土地价值一年一年地不断提高，我们不应该容许把很好的可耕地为埋葬死人而浪费。
