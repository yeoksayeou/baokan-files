    Waste Cotton Washed into White Cotton
    A cotton washing factory has been newly built in Xi'an. This factory can wash more than 324,000 jin of old and waste cotton into good cotton every year. If supplied according to the standard of 1.5 jin per person, it can solve the cotton needs of more than 216,000 people.
    The production process of this factory is: boiling and disinfecting the old and waste cotton with chemical hot water, then washing away the stains in the cotton with clean water, and then fluffing it into batting after drying and sunning. Judging from the batting produced by this factory, it is as white as snow, has long fibers, and can maintain its original windproof and warmth-keeping effectiveness.

    废棉洗成白棉花
    西安新建了一座洗棉厂。这个厂每年可洗三十二万四千多斤旧、废棉变成好棉，如按每人一斤半标准供应，可解决二十一万六千多人的用棉要求。
    这个厂的生产过程是：把旧、废棉用化学开水蒸煮、消毒，再用清水洗去棉花内的污痕，经过烘、晒后弹制成絮棉。从这个厂弹出的絮棉来看，色白如雪、纤维长，能保持原来隔风、暖和的效能。
