Traveling South in a High Tide

II. Impressions of Baoding

Comrade, have you ever been to Baoding? What is your impression of Baoding?

If someone asked me that, I would tell them: Baoding is a simple city.

From an Architectural Perspective

If we look at it from the perspective of construction figures, the newly added construction area in Baoding City in recent years is not small. According to statistics from the Municipal Construction Bureau, the original construction area of Baoding City at the time of liberation was 1.5 million square meters, and the newly added construction area in recent years totals 1.61 million square meters. This means that it has more than doubled. However, if we analyze it specifically, we will get a different impression. Among the 1.61 million square meters of construction area, the enterprises built here by the central industrial departments and the residential construction area for the employees of these enterprises account for nearly one-tenth. Baoding City is a city with developed educational undertakings. Since liberation, 26 new specialized schools, secondary technical schools, and cadre schools have been established, and ordinary middle schools and primary schools have also developed considerably. The construction area of these schools accounts for a large proportion of the total newly added construction area in Baoding City. As for newly built office buildings, hotels, shops, cinemas, etc., they can be described as "rare as morning stars."

The standards of new buildings in Baoding City are also relatively low. Generally, they are two or three stories high, most without heating equipment, and decorations with carved beams and painted rafters or gold leaf are even rarer. The most eye-catching new building here is the three-story Hebei Hotel. The reporter is staying here. If measured by "Beijing standards," the Hebei Hotel can only barely stand with the Dongsi Hotel in Beijing. But in Baoding, it already has a bit of a "crane standing among chickens" feel. From here, we can also see what the general standard of construction in Baoding City is.

Life in Government Offices

If you have the opportunity to visit various provincial and municipal government offices, you will find that most of these offices, including the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hebei Provincial People's Committee, the Baoding Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Baoding Municipal People's Committee, are located in single-story buildings. Of course, single-story buildings can also be very beautiful and comfortable to live in. Things like wooden floors, carved doors and windows, and vermilion gates also give a magnificent impression. But the vast majority of the single-story buildings here are extremely ordinary. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is located in Hebei University, which has been closed for many years. There are no tall buildings here, and many single-story buildings have neither floors nor cement floors, but rather blue brick floors. As of now, there is still no heating equipment or flush toilets. These dirt floors, single-story buildings, pit toilets, and heating by stoves all make it feel less like being in the Provincial Committee and more like being in a central primary school in the countryside. The Provincial Committee office is like this, and so are other offices. I once heard that the office of the Director of the Second Industry Department of the Provincial People's Committee was newly built, and I rushed to take a look, only to find that it was also an ordinary single-story building.

In the various provincial and municipal government offices in Baoding, there is also a common feature: many of the more responsible cadres have a bed in their offices. At first, I thought it was for the convenience of the leaders to take a nap; later, I learned that many responsible cadres sleep in their offices at night. But I couldn't figure it out: Don't they have homes? Why don't they go home to sleep? I wanted to ask several times, but I was reluctant to ask because it involved other people's family lives. Finally, I came to the office of Wei Kezhong, Director of the Baoding Municipal Construction Bureau. Here, there was also a bed on the blue brick floor. I couldn't help it and boldly asked him, "Why don't you go home to sleep?"

Director Wei smiled and said, "The house at home is small and crowded, it's better to sleep here." He pointed to the Deputy Director sitting opposite him and said, "Take him, for example! There are six or seven people in his family, and they are assigned to one and a half small rooms, so they have to put a bed in the office." The Deputy Director said humorously, "Fortunately, Baoding is a small city, and the dormitories are close, just like the front yard and the back yard, so it's still convenient."

They also told me that in Baoding City, the number of people actually living per hectare of residential area in the most crowded places exceeds the quota promulgated by the central government by more than double. Because in recent years, the population of Baoding City has increased from more than 60,000 to more than 200,000, while the residential area has increased very little. In this way, cadres with conditions try to sleep in the office, which is also convenient for reading and writing at night.

In fact, this is also the tradition of the old cadres. In the past, in the base areas, what was the difference between an office and a dormitory? They worked wherever they slept, and they worked wherever they slept. It was only after entering the city that conditions were better in some places, and this habit was changed; the conditions in Baoding City are not as good as in other places, and this tradition of "being at home everywhere" has been maintained. Our many responsible cadres are content with "being at home everywhere," which is a great education for the comrades below. I heard that some cadres were arguing about houses and making trouble. When they walked into the leader's office and saw a bed squeezed into the small office, and that the leader slept here at night, they stopped talking.

Thrifty Construction

Using the original foundation, not easily engaging in large-scale construction, is not the same as being listless and doing nothing. Baoding City's civil construction is very tight, but it is making unremitting efforts to build Baoding from a consumer city into a production city.

Speaking of Baoding's industry, there used to be two jingles: "Gan Yi in the South Gate, Bao Ji in the West Gate." Gan Yi was a small flour mill, and Bao Ji was an oil mill with only one oil press. These were the two most famous factories in Baoding City before liberation. In addition, there was a very small power plant and a repair shop for repairing guns. Furthermore, the Japanese had once built a small brick and tile factory here, but because the kiln had been shut down for many years, by the time of liberation, the kiln bricks had been stripped away, leaving only a bare chimney standing in the overgrown wasteland. Baoding City's industry developed on this dilapidated foundation. Now, the main industrial products produced in Baoding City include steam engines, water pumps, malleable cast iron, bacterial fertilizers, granular fertilizers, water wheels, carpets, flannel, flour, and dozens of other types, most of which could not be produced before. The enterprises in the municipal industrial bureau system alone had a total output value in 1957 that was more than double that of 1952.

Baoding City's factories each have an interesting history of development from small to large. The Baoding Machinery Factory, which manufactures steam engines in large quantities and is currently trial-producing gas engines, was developed on the basis of a gun repair shop left by the Kuomintang. The Baoding Cultural and Educational Supplies Factory, with more than 300 workers, was formerly a small workshop attached to Xinhua Bookstore with only a dozen workers. The Rongsheng Weaving Factory was called the "Widow Factory" before liberation. It was sponsored by a "social charity organization" and had only a few hand looms, specializing in "accommodating" lonely widows to weave cloth. Now it has developed into a small factory with a rough scale. The Baoding Cigarette Factory is an "old revolutionary factory." It used to be a hand-rolled cigarette workshop in the liberated areas. After liberation, it moved to Baoding to expand production. In addition, there are some factories that were completely newly built without any foundation. The Baoding Bacterial Fertilizer Factory is one of them. Bacterial fertilizer plays a mediating and promoting role in the absorption of fertilizers from the soil and air by plants, and it plays a significant role in increasing agricultural production. According to the results of farmland experiments, spending ten cents per mu and using one jin of bacterial fertilizer can increase production by as much as 20%. I really wanted to visit this factory that cultivates bacteria, so I inquired about where the factory was located. In my opinion, Baoding is so small, it shouldn't be difficult to find a factory on a street. But Yang Zhichang, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, asked the Municipal Industry Bureau to send a comrade to guide me, and we found the factory in a secluded alley after passing through streets and lanes. It turned out that the factory was located in civilian houses and was divided into two locations.

It's not just the bacterial fertilizer factory; many factories in Baoding City are located in civilian houses and ancestral halls. Because they don't pursue large factories and new equipment, and everything is simple, Baoding City's local industrial construction spends very little money. During the first five-year plan period, the enterprises in the municipal industrial bureau system accumulated more than 37 million yuan in funds for the country, while the basic construction investment during the same period, including the technical measures expenses of the enterprises, only cost more than 2.3 million yuan. It is particularly worth mentioning that during the first five-year plan period, the number of employees in the municipal industrial bureau system increased by nearly two times, but in recent years, in addition to spending more than 100,000 yuan to build some welfare facilities such as nurseries, employee canteens, and bathhouses, not a single square meter of employee dormitory has been built. In 1956, the number of employees increased sharply, and the housing problem was more serious, so some dormitories were built using the method of self-construction with public assistance.

Self-construction with public assistance, this method of relying on the strength of the masses to solve problems, is also widely used in municipal construction. In and out of Baoding City, there were originally only four city gate openings in the east, west, north, and south that were less than three or four meters wide, and transportation was very inconvenient. In recent years, the city walls have been demolished using methods such as work-for-relief, which has facilitated traffic. The bricks removed were used to build sewers, and the soil removed was used to fill stagnant water pits. Greening the city and developing parks are also mobilizing the masses for voluntary labor. Baoding City did not have tap water in the past, and a tap water plant was newly built in 1957. In addition to the state investing in building factories and laying main road pipes, the laying of branch pipes and the installation of faucets were all self-built by the masses through fundraising. Some people may say, "Isn't this too stingy?" But for the people of Baoding, the feeling is completely different. In the past, the people of Baoding City bought well water to drink, which tasted bitter and polluted, and they had to spend a few cents every day. Now the state has built a tap water plant, and each household can drink clean tap water by spending two or three yuan to connect a pipe, and the daily water bill is also greatly reduced. Therefore, they welcome this method.

Maintaining Glory

There have been different understandings of Baoding City's thrifty and simple style in the past. Some comrades always felt that Baoding was "too shabby" and "too unlike a provincial capital." In particular, some comrades who had been to the provincial capitals of other provinces felt even more discouraged after returning. In 1956, several industrial ministries of the central government were preparing to build some larger enterprises here, and some comrades in Baoding City also became enthusiastic, believing that the conditions were ripe and that they could engage in a "large city plan." So they wanted to build east-west and north-south trunk roads, planning to demolish many houses and build many buildings in the urban area. As a result, this plan was completely rejected by the Provincial Party Committee, and the cadres received a profound education.

Of course, even now, we cannot say that all construction in Baoding City is thrifty and that all cadres are simple. There is also waste in Baoding; some are also very serious. For example, from 1956 to the first quarter of 1957 alone, the land that was requisitioned early, requisitioned excessively, and requisitioned but not used amounted to about 3,000 mu. Whether Baoding City can maintain its glorious tradition of thrift and simplicity in the future depends on whether the cadres here and the various relevant construction units can further and better implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift.

    二、保　定　印　象
    同志，你到过保定吗？保定给你的印象如何？
    如果有人这样问我，我就告诉他：保定是一个朴素的城市。
    从建筑上看
    如果从建筑数字上看，这几年保定市新增加的建筑面积也不少。据市建设局统计，解放时保定市原有的建筑面积共一百五十万平方公尺，几年来新增加的建筑面积共一百六十一万平方公尺。这就是说，增加了一倍多。可是，如果具体分析一下，就会得到另一种印象。这一百六十一万平方公尺建筑面积中，中央工业部门在这里兴建的一些企业和这些企业的职工住宅建筑面积，就占了将近十分之一。保定市是一个教育事业发达的城市。解放后新设的专科学校、中等技术学校和干部学校就有二十六所，普通中学和小学也发展了不少。这些学校的建筑面积，在保定市新增加的建筑面积总数中，占了很大的比例。至于新建的办公楼、旅馆、商店、电影院等等，可以说是“寥若晨星”。
    保定市的新建筑，标准也比较低。一般都是两、三层楼，大都没有暖气设备，雕梁画栋、贴金涂彩的装饰更少见。这里最引人注目的新建筑，要算是三层楼的河北饭店了。记者就借宿在这里。若拿“北京标准”来衡量，河北饭店只能勉强同北京的东四旅馆站在一起。但在保定，它已有点“鹤立鸡群”之感了。从这里也可以看到保定市的建筑大致是个什么标准。
    机关生活
    如果有机会到各个省、市机关去访问，你会发现这些机关，包括中共河北省委会、河北省人民委员会、中共保定市委会和保定市人民委员会，绝大多数都设在平房里。当然，平房也可以是很漂亮，住着很舒服的。诸如木板铺地、雕花门窗、朱漆大门等等，也给人一种堂皇的印象。但这里的平房，绝大多数都是极其普通的。中共河北省委会设在停办多年的河北大学里。这里没有高楼大厦，许多平房既没有地板，也没有洋灰地，而是青砖地。截至目前为止，这里还没有暖气设备和抽水便池。这些泥地、平房、挖坑为厕、围炉取暖，都使人感到不像是在省委会，而像是在乡下的中心小学里。省委机关是如此，其他机关也是如此。我曾打听到省人民委员会第二工业厅厅长的办公室是新建的，赶去看了看，原来也是普通的平房。
    在保定的各个省、市机关里，还有一个共同的特点：很多比较负责的干部的办公室里都架有一张床。起初，我以为是为了首长们睡午觉方便；后来才知道许多负责干部晚上都睡在办公室里。但我又想不通：他们没有家吗？为什么不回家去睡？几次想问，碍于涉及到别人的家庭生活，不便启口。最后，我来到保定市建设局魏可忠局长的办公室里。这里，青砖地上也架着一张床。我忍不住了，冒昧地问他：“你为什么不回家去睡呢？”
    魏局长笑了笑说：“家里房子小，人多，那有这儿睡着好。”他指着坐在对面的副局长说：“拿他来说吧！家里六、七口人，分配到一间半小房，只好在办公室里架张床。”副局长幽默地说：“好在保定城小，宿舍离得近，就同前院跟后院一样，也还方便。”
    他们还告诉我：保定市每公顷居住面积实际居住的人数，最多的地方，较中央颁布的定额超过一倍。因为几年来保定市的人口由六万多人增加到二十多万人，而住宅面积增加得很少。这样，有条件的干部都争取睡在办公室里，晚上看看书，写点东西也方便。
    其实，这也是老干部的传统。从前在根据地里，哪有什么办公室和宿舍之分？在哪儿工作就在哪儿睡，睡在哪儿就在哪儿工作。只是在进城之后，有些地方条件好些，改变了这种习惯；保定市的条件不如别的地方，这种“到处为家”的传统还保持下来。我们的许多负责干部安于“到处为家”，对下面的同志是很大的教育。听说有些干部争房子、闹意见，一走进领导干部的办公室，看到小小的办公室里还挤着一张床，首长晚上睡在这儿，就不再言语了。
    勤俭建设
    利用原有的基础，不轻易大兴土木，不等于暮气沉沉，不事建设。保定市的民用建筑扣得很紧，但对于把保定从一个消费城市建设成一个生产城市，却是努力不懈的。
    提起保定的工业，过去也有两句顺口溜：“南关数干义，西关数宝记”。干义是个小面粉厂，宝记是个只有一台榨油机的油厂。这就是保定市解放前最著名的两家工厂了。除此之外，还有一个很小的电厂，一个修理枪支的修械所。再有，就是日本人曾经在这儿办过一个小砖瓦厂，由于停窑多年，到解放的时候，窑砖已经给扒光了，只剩下一根光秃秃的烟囱竖在杂草丛生的荒地上。保定市的工业就是在这个破烂的基础上发展起来的。现在，保定市生产的主要工业品有蒸汽机、水泵、玛钢、细菌肥料、颗粒肥料、水车、地毯、绒布、面粉等几十种，大都是从前不能生产的。仅市工业局系统的企业，1957年的生产总值就比1952年增长了一倍多。
    保定市的工厂各有一个有趣的、由小到大的发展历史。大量制造蒸汽机，并正在试制煤气机的保定机械厂，是在国民党留下的一个修理枪支的修械所的基础上发展起来的。拥有三百多工人的保定文教用品厂，前身是新华书店附设的一个只有十几个工人的小作坊。荣生织布厂解放前叫作“寡妇厂”，是“社会慈善机关”主办的，只有几台手工织布机，专门“收容”孤苦的寡妇织布，现在已发展为一个粗具规模的小工厂。保定烟厂是个“老革命厂”。它从前是解放区里的一个手工卷烟作坊，解放后搬到保定来扩大了生产。此外，没有一点基础，完全新建的工厂也有一些。保定细菌肥料厂是其中的一个。细菌肥料对植物吸收土壤和空气中的肥料起着一种媒介和促进的作用，在农业增产上作用很大。据农田试验的结果表明，每亩地花一毛钱，使用细菌肥料一斤，最高可以增产百分之二十几。我很想参观一下这个培植细菌的工厂，便打听工厂设在哪里。照我的想法，保定这么小，有一条街名，还不容易找到一家工厂么。但市委书记处杨志昌书记却找市工业局派了一个同志给我作向导，穿过大街小巷，在一条辟静的小胡同里才找到这家工厂。原来工厂就设在民房里，而且还分设在两处。
    不只是细菌肥料厂一家，保定市的许多工厂都设在民房和祠堂里。由于不追求大厂房、新设备，一切从简，保定市的地方工业建设花钱很少。第一个五年计划期间，市工业局系统的企业，共为国家积累资金三千七百多万元，而同一期间的基本建设投资，包括企业的技术措施费用，才花了二百三十多万元。特别值得一提的是，第一个五年计划期间，市工业局系统的职工人数增加了近两倍，但几年来除了用十多万元建设了一些托儿所、职工食堂和澡堂等福利设施外，没有盖一平方公尺职工宿舍。1956年职工人数骤增，住房问题比较严重，才用自建公助的办法建了一些宿舍。
    自建公助，这种依靠群众的力量解决问题的方法，也被广泛运用在市政建设上。出入保定市，原来只是东西南北四个宽不到三、四公尺的城门洞，交通很不方便。几年来，用以工代赈等方法拆除了城墙，便利了往来。拆下来的砖，砌了下水道，拆下来的土，填了积水坑。绿化城市，开拓公园，也是发动群众义务劳动。保定市过去没有自来水，1957年新建了自来水厂。除了国家投资建厂、铺设干道管外，铺支管、设龙头，都是群众集资自建的。也许有人说：“这未免太小气了。”但对保定人民说来，观感完全不同。保定市人民过去买井水喝，水污味苦，每天还得花几分钱。现在国家建设了自来水厂，每户花二、三元钱合接一根管子，可以喝到清洁的自来水，日常的水费开支也大大降低。因此，他们欢迎这种办法。
    保持光荣
    对于保定市这种勤俭朴素的作风，过去也曾有过不同的认识。有些同志总觉得保定“太寒酸”了，“太不像省会”了。特别是有些同志到过外省的省会，回来以后更觉得泄气。1956年，中央几个工业部在这里筹建一些比较大的企业，保定市的有些同志脑袋也热起来，认为条件成熟，可以搞“大市计划”了。于是想搞东西干道，南北干道，计划在市区拆除多少房子，建设多少楼房。结果，这个计划全盘给省委否定了，干部们受到一次深刻的教育。
    当然，即便在现在，也不能说保定市所有的建设都是勤俭的、所有的干部都是朴素的。保定也有浪费；有些也很严重。例如仅1956年至1957年第一季度，早征、多征和征而不用的土地即达三千亩左右。保定市今后能不能保持勤俭朴素的光荣，就看这里的干部和各个有关的建设单位能不能进一步更好地贯彻勤俭建国的方针。
