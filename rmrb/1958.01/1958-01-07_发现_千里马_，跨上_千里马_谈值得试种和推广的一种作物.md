Discovering a "Thoroughbred Horse," Riding a "Thoroughbred Horse"
--On a Crop Worth Trying and Promoting
By the Editorial Board of this Newspaper

Today, this newspaper published the news that Shangshui County in Henan Province successfully trialed "Medicinal Corn" (namely, Coix seed, called Job's tears or pearl barley after shelling). From this news, we can understand that "Medicinal Corn" is a crop worth trying and promoting in various regions (especially in areas with severe drought and flood disasters). This news also reminds us that we should more actively investigate and research various excellent crop varieties in various regions and unearth the treasures that have been buried for many years.

"Medicinal Corn" was originally not a crop of Shangshui County (in the central Henan region), but was introduced by a farmer in the county from Bo'ai County in northern Henan several years ago. In the spring of 1957, the Shangshui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered its advantages, studied its growth patterns, and understood that it was suitable for local needs. They actively trialed it in a timely manner, which enabled it to blossom and bear fruit on a relatively large scale in Shangshui County. This fact tells us that there may be very good crop varieties in various regions that have not yet attracted the attention of leaders. "Thoroughbred horses are always available," but without discerning horse trainers, they are often buried. In our era, discerning horse trainers are not uncommon but are increasing; as long as cadres at all levels go deep among the masses, connect with reality, and study enthusiastically and humbly, grasp the laws of the movement of things, they can have the discerning eyes of a horse trainer and find many "thoroughbred horses." Comrades engaged in rural work and agricultural work should aspire to be the discerning horse trainers of the new era, find all kinds of "thoroughbred horses," give full play to their role, and promote the socialist cause to advance "a thousand miles a day."

At present, many regions in our country are still afraid of both drought and flood. The "natural law" of spring drought and autumn flood, followed by flood and then drought, still seriously threatens agricultural production in these regions. The main difficulties in these areas are: frequent water and drought disasters, low crop yields, unstable production, and relatively slow improvement in people's living standards; at the same time, due to frequent water and drought disasters, the masses also lack firewood, and some places have to transport coal from hundreds of miles away as fuel. The lack of fuel leads to a shortage of feed and fertilizer. These in turn hinder the development of agricultural production. In recent years, the Party and the government have vigorously led the masses to carry out the transformation of low-lying areas and the elimination of waterlogging in the plains, and the situation has improved greatly; however, in order to further develop agricultural production in these areas, much work remains to be done. In addition to actively carrying out water conservancy construction and planning to store as much rainwater as possible locally for use during the flood season, these areas should also actively try and promote some drought-resistant and flood-resistant crops. "Medicinal Corn" is such a crop.

The experience of Shangshui County shows that promoting "Medicinal Corn" is one of the effective ways to solve the many difficulties currently existing in these areas. If it is successfully trialed and widely planted in these areas, and if the distribution of planting areas is appropriate, coupled with active water conservancy construction, water and drought disasters can be greatly reduced, and agricultural production can be greatly advanced, thereby reversing the passive situation of these areas in terms of production and food issues. When the flood season arrives, the excess rainwater from nearby farmland can be planned to be discharged into the "Medicinal Corn" fields, making it a flood storage area (or a "crop reservoir" because it both grows crops and stores water). In case of autumn drought, the stored water can be diverted to irrigate nearby farmland. In this way, there will be no disaster in times of flood, and no disaster in times of drought, or only very small disasters. In this way, the phenomenon of "water disasters moving" (draining water disasters from one area to other areas, causing disasters to other areas) can be stopped, and disputes between upstream and downstream areas can be reduced. Large-scale planting of "Medicinal Corn" will easily solve the problem of firewood shortage for the local people. Based on a yield of 10,000 catties of straw per mu, an average of one mu of "Medicinal Corn" per household will not be difficult to obtain firewood.

Is it only areas with more severe drought and flood disasters that need to actively try and promote "Medicinal Corn"? No. Coix seed has always been regarded as a treasure and tonic. In the past, only a few people could eat it. If it is successfully trialed and widely planted throughout the country, so that farmers and urban residents in various regions can eat it regularly or even every day, making it part of the staple food of the Chinese people, how important would this be to improving people's health! Achieving this wish is not very difficult, as long as the trials are successful in various places. According to the experience of Shangshui, its development speed is very fast; within a few years, it can be planted on a large scale. Of course, although it is a tonic, whether it can become a regular food still needs a period of experimentation. However, judging from the current situation, appropriately developing this crop is clearly beneficial and harmless.

For many regions, "Medicinal Corn" is an unfamiliar variety, and cadres and the masses lack experience in planting it. In order to be able to successfully trial and gain experience, some preparatory work should be done quickly, such as preparing seeds, sending people to visit and study in areas where this crop has already been planted, studying its growth patterns and cultivation techniques, and so on. Only with adequate preparation can we ensure the success of the trial and lay a good foundation for further promotion. For its alkali resistance, various regions should consciously conduct experiments; if it is alkali-resistant, it will provide more favorable conditions for the transformation of saline-alkali wasteland. Regarding its regenerative ability, agricultural departments and agricultural scientific research institutions can also begin research and experiments.

Our motherland is vast and rich in resources, and there are indeed many treasures. In the past, in the absence of unified planning, extremely dispersed production, and weak strength, many material forces and the wisdom of the masses were buried. With the leadership of the Communist Party and with agricultural cooperation, the situation is completely different. By making full use of all favorable conditions, we can turn the treasures of one family and one place into the treasures of the people of the whole country, and turn the extremely limited treasures into endless treasures. We must unearth all the buried treasures and let them shine brightly under the socialist sunshine!

    发现“千里马”，跨上“千里马”
    ——谈值得试种和推广的一种作物
    本报评论员
    本报今天发表了河南省商水县试种“药玉米”（即薏苡，去壳后叫薏仁或薏米）成功的消息。从这个消息中可以了解，“药玉米”是值得各地（特别是旱涝灾害比较严重的地区）试种和推广的一种作物。这消息还提起我们注意，应该更积极地调查研究各地的各种优良的作物品种，把多年埋藏着的珍宝发掘出来。
    “药玉米”原不是商水县（在豫中地区）的作物，而是这个县的一位农民几年前由豫北的博爱县引进的。1957年春天，中共商水县委发现了它的优点，研究了它的生长规律，了解它正适合当地需要，及时地积极试种，才使它在商水县比较大量地开花结果。这个事实告诉我们，各地都可能有很好的作物品种还没有引起领导者的注意。“千里马常有”，没有伯乐，它们就常会被埋没。在我们的时代，伯乐不是不常有而是越来越多了；各级干部只要深入群众，联系实际，热心地虚心地学习，掌握事物运动的规律，就能具有伯乐的慧眼，就能把许多“千里马”找出来。从事农村工作和农业工作的同志们，应立志做新时代的伯乐，找出各式各样的“千里马”，充分发挥它们的作用，促使社会主义事业“一日千里”地前进。
    目前，我国有不少地区仍然是既怕旱又怕涝。春旱秋涝、涝后再旱的“自然规律”仍然严重地威胁着这类地区的农业生产。这类地区的主要困难是：水旱灾害较多，作物产量低，生产不稳定，人民生活水平的提高也比较缓慢；同时，由于水旱灾害多，群众的烧柴也比较缺乏，有的地方要从几百里外运煤去作燃料。燃料缺乏引起饲料和肥料的紧张。这些又反转来妨碍农业生产的发展。近年以来，党和政府大力领导群众进行了洼地改造和平原除涝工作，情况已经大有好转；但是，为了进一步发展这些地区的农业生产，还要做很多工作。这类地区，除了应积极开展水利建设，有计划地把汛期雨水尽量就地蓄存备用以外，还应该积极试种和推广一些耐旱耐涝作物。“药玉米”就是这样的一种作物。
    商水县的经验说明，推广“药玉米”是解决这类地区目前存在着的许多困难的有效办法之一。如果在这类地区试种成功并且大量种植起来，又如果种植它的地区分布适当，再加上积极进行水利建设，就可以使旱涝灾害大大减轻，使农业生产大大跃进，从而扭转这类地区在生产上和粮食等问题上的被动局面。汛期到了，可以把附近农田多余的雨水有计划地泄入“药玉米”地里，使它成为蓄洪区（或者叫做“作物小水库”，因为它既长庄稼又蓄水）。遇到秋旱，又可以把蓄存起来的水引出来浇灌附近的农田。这样，就可以做到涝时不灾，旱时也不灾，或者只有很小的灾。这样，“水患搬家”（一个地区有水患时把它排泄到其它地区，使其他地区受灾）的现象可以停止，上下游之间的纠纷也就可以减少。大量种植“药玉米”，当地群众缺柴的困难也就容易解决。以亩产一万斤秸棵计算，平均每户有一亩多地“药玉米”，烧柴就不困难了。
    是不是只有旱涝灾害较严重的地区才需要积极试种和推广“药玉米”呢？不是。薏仁历来被视为珍品和补品，过去，只有很少的人能吃到它。如果全国各地试种成功并且广为种植，使得各地农民以及城市居民能经常地甚至每天吃到它，使它成为我国人民的主食的一部分，这对于增进人民的健康该是多么重要的一件事！实现这个愿望也并不很难，只要各地试种成功，根据商水的经验，它的发展速度是很快的；几年之内，就能大量种植起来。当然，它虽是补品，能否成为一种经常的食品，还需要经过一段试验时间。但是，就目前情况看来，适当发展这种作物显然是有益无害的。
    对许多地区说来，“药玉米”是一个不熟悉的品种，干部和群众都缺乏种植它的经验。为了能试种成功和取得经验，目前就应赶快进行一些准备工作，如准备种籽，派人到已经种植这种作物的地区参观学习，研究它的生长规律和耕作技术等等。只有准备充分，才能保证试种成功，为进一步推广打下良好的基础。对于它的抗碱能力，各地应有意识地进行试验；如能抗碱，就为改造盐碱荒地提供了更有利的条件。关于它的再生能力，农业部门及农业科学研究机构也可以着手研究和试验。
    我们的祖国地大物博，宝藏的确很多。在过去缺乏统一规划、生产极其分散、力量薄弱的情况下，许多物质力量和群众智慧被埋没着。有了共产党的领导，有了农业合作化，局面就完全不同了。充分利用一切有利条件，就可以把一家一地的财宝变成全国人民的财宝，把极其有限的财宝变成无穷无尽的财宝。我们一定要把一切埋藏着的宝贝都发掘出来，让它们在社会主义的阳光照射下大放光芒！
