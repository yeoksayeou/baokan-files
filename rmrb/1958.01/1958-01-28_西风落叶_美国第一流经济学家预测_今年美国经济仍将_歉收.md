    Fallen Leaves in the West Wind
    Top American Economists Predict
    Another "Poor Harvest" for the US Economy This Year
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: "New York Post" reporter Childs, in a dispatch from Washington titled "A Year of Poor Harvests," said: Leading American economists unanimously believe that the US economy will continue to decline this year.
    Childs said that US Secretary of Labor Mitchell has been warning the government since last September that the US is facing difficulties that are more serious in nature than the government realizes.
    Childs said that leading American economists agree with Mitchell's opinion. Economists believe that by the end of January, the US unemployment figures will reach 4.5 million (two years ago at this time, it was 2.8 million). By March, the total could be as high as six million.
    The news also said that economists like Leon Keyserling (chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Truman administration) have an even more serious view, believing that what is happening is much more serious than anyone has formally admitted.

    西风落叶
    美国第一流经济学家预测
    今年美国经济仍将“歉收”
    据新华社讯　“纽约邮报”记者蔡尔兹以“歉收的年份”为题自华盛顿报道说：美国第一流的经济学家一致认为，今年美国经济将继续下降。
    蔡尔兹说，美国劳工部长密契尔从去年9月以来，就一直在向政府警告说，美国将面临着其性质比政府所认识到的更为严重的困难。
    蔡尔兹说，美国第一流的经济学家都同意密契尔的意见。经济学家认为，到1月底，美国的失业数字将达到四百五十万（两年前的这个时候是二百八十万）。到3月份，总数可能高达六百万。
    消息还说，像里昂·凯塞林（杜鲁门政府时期的经济顾问委员会主席）一派的经济学家的看法更加严重，他们认为所发生的情况比任何人已经正式承认的要严重得多。
