Xinhua News Agency, New York, 29th: The overall decline in U.S. economic activity, which became serious at the end of last year, continues to develop. The January 17th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" stated that the decline in business activity is accelerating, and a wave of layoffs is sweeping from one industry to another, from one region to another. According to the magazine's estimate, the industrial production index for January of this year will further decline to 133 (136 in December 1957, and 146 in January 1957).

The production indices of some important industrial sectors almost uniformly show a decline. In order to conceal the serious inadequacy of steel industry operations, the American Iron and Steel Institute has decided to discontinue the "Weekly Forecast of Steel Production Operating Rate," which it has been publishing for twenty-four years, and to adopt a new index to report on steel industry production. According to reports, for the week ending January 18, according to the new index, steel industry production was 95.7 (1947-1949 being 100), while it was 153.6 in the same period a year ago, a decrease of 37%.

Automobile industry production decreased by 6.1% in the week ending January 18 compared to the previous week, and 22.8% compared to the same period a year ago. According to the January 10 issue of "U.S. News & World Report," the entire automobile industry's production in January of this year is estimated to decrease by 19% compared to the same period last year, reducing it to the lowest level since 1954.

Large-scale construction projects decreased by 34% in the same week compared to the same period a year ago. In the eighteen days after the New Year, the overall large-scale construction projects decreased by 37% compared to the same period last year.

The production of oil, bituminous coal, copper, zinc, aluminum, and electricity has also decreased.

The decline in production has led to a reduction in railway freight and an increase in unemployment. In the week ending January 18, railway freight volume decreased by 16.4% compared to the same period a year ago.

According to American newspapers, the current number of unemployed in the United States has exceeded four million. The U.S. Department of Labor announced on the 24th that, for the week ending January 11, the number of workers applying for unemployment benefits reached 2,863,000, the highest record in eight years. The Department of Labor said that since the New Year, the number of unemployed has continued to increase in many regions across the country, especially in forty-five industrial centers, where more than 6% of the local labor force is idle and without work.

As a measure to缓和 the decline in economic activity, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia once again announced on the 21st a reduction in the discount rate, lowering the current 3.5% discount rate to 3%, attempting to give economic activity a shot in the arm. Democratic congressmen said that the government's adoption of this measure shows that the economic recession in the United States is "more serious" than the government admits.

The decline in business activity threatens the living standards of the vast working masses in the United States, and many workers have put forward demands for increased wages.

    美国经济活动加速全面下降
    工业指数本月将降到133　失业大军已超过四百万人
    据新华社29日讯　纽约消息：去年年底趋于严重的美国经济活动的全面下降在继续发展。1月17日的一期“美国新闻与世界报道”说，企业活动的下降在加速，解雇的浪潮席卷着一个工业到另一个工业，一个地区到另一个地区。据这家杂志估计，今年1月份的工业生产指数将进一步下降到一百三十三（1957年12月是一百三十六，1957年1月是一百四十六）。
    一些重要工业部门的生产指数差不多显示出一致的下降。美国钢铁研究所为了掩盖钢铁工业开工的严重不足，已经决定不再发表它二十四年来一直在发表的“钢铁生产开工率每周预报”，而采用新的指数来报告钢铁工业生产情况。据报告，在到1月18日为止的一周，根据新的指数，钢铁工业的生产是九十五点七（1947—1949年为一百），而一年前同期却是一百五十三点六，减少了37％。
    汽车工业的生产在到18日为止的一周中比前一周下降了6.1％，比一年前同期下降了22.8％，据1月10日的“美国新闻与世界报道”估计，整个汽车工业在今年1月份的生产将比去年同期减少19％，减少到1954年来的最低水平。
    大型建筑工程在同一周比一年前同期减少了34％。新年以后十八天内，整个大型建筑工程比去年同期减少了37％。
    石油、烟煤、铜、锌、铝和电力的生产也都减少了。
    生产的下降导致了铁路货运的减少和失业增加。在到18日为止的一周中，铁路货运量比一年前同期减少了16.4％。
    据美国报刊指出，美国目前的失业人数已经超过四百万。美国劳工部24日宣布，到1月11日为止的一周，申请失业救济的工人达到了二百八十六万三千人，为八年来的最高纪录。劳工部说，新年以来，在全国许多地区失业人数都在继续增加，特别是在四十五个工业中心，占当地劳动力的6％以上的工人都闲着没有工作。
    作为缓和经济活动下降的一个措施，费城联邦储备银行在21日再一次宣布降低贴现率，把目前3.5％的贴现率降到3％，企图借此对经济活动打强心针。民主党国会议员说，政府采取这个措施说明美国的经济衰退比政府所承认的“更为严重”。
    企业活动下降威胁到美国广大工人群众的生活水平，许多工人纷纷提出增加工资的要求。
