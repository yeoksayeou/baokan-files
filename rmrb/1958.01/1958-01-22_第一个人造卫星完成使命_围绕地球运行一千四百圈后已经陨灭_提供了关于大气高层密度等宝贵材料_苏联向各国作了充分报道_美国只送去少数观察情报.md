Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: TASS, Moscow, January 20th: Based on observations and orbital calculations, it has been determined that the first artificial Earth satellite fell into the dense atmosphere and burned up on January 4th. The satellite's entry into the dense atmosphere and its burning were not directly recorded. From December 28th to January 5th, there were reports from various parts of the Soviet Union of seeing flying luminous objects, but these were only meteors, as their locations and times did not correspond to the satellite's orbital plane.

The first artificial Earth satellite, launched on October 4, 1957, initially orbiting the Earth every 96.2 minutes, with a maximum orbital distance of 950 kilometers from the ground, existed as a cosmic body for 92 days and nights. During this period, the first artificial Earth satellite orbited the Earth 1,400 times, traveling approximately 60 million kilometers, equal to the distance from Earth to Mars when Mars is closest to Earth.

Observations of the first artificial satellite provided valuable scientific intelligence on the density of the upper atmosphere and the laws governing the operation of artificial Earth satellites.

A TASS reporter learned from the Soviet International Geophysical Year Committee that the calculations of the satellite's lifespan by Soviet scientists were completely accurate. Careful observation of the satellite's operation, the methods created by Soviet mathematicians, and the use of rapid electronic computers made it possible to accurately predict the satellite's position at every instant.

The observations made during the first satellite's operation enabled us to collect valuable scientific material about the density of the upper atmosphere, the structure of the ionosphere, and other geophysical phenomena. The signals from the satellite at a wavelength of fifteen meters could be received at distances far beyond the line of sight, reaching 10,000 kilometers in many cases. The study of satellite signals revealed the formation of a unique waveguide within certain layers of the ionosphere, facilitating the transmission of radio waves over long distances.

It has been determined that the danger from meteors is actually less than previously anticipated. The satellite passed through several meteor showers, yet remained undamaged for a long period. The temperature conditions in which the satellite was operating have been ascertained. Based on preliminary results of observing the flight of the first satellite, the parameters of the second artificial satellite and its orbit were accurately determined.

The Soviet International Geophysical Year Committee took measures to fully report to scientists and the general public of all countries on the most important characteristics of the experiments conducted with the world's first artificial celestial body.

Long before the satellite was launched, numerous articles were published in scientific journals, detailing the experimental methods and corresponding instruments used during the satellite's flight. Many articles describing radio receivers for receiving satellite signals were published in radio amateur magazines in advance, and some materials guiding optical observations were published in astronomical publications.

The various issues related to the launch of the satellite have been widely discussed in various general and scientific publications in the Soviet Union.

In this way, all countries in the world were able to organize observations of the satellite.

Observation stations and radio amateurs in many countries provided great help in collecting data on the satellite's flight. The Soviet International Geophysical Year Committee received a large number of letters and telegrams regarding observations. Scientists from Czechoslovakia, the People's Republic of China, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and other people's democratic countries provided valuable materials. Observatories and observation stations in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and some Latin American countries provided their observations.

At the same time, the United States, which had a large number of well-prepared observation stations, sent only a small amount of information.

Now, the Soviet International Geophysical Year Committee, in accordance with its obligations, has prepared a preliminary scientific report on the satellite's flight and is distributing it to various international geophysical year organizations.

    第一个人造卫星完成使命
    围绕地球运行一千四百圈后已经陨灭
    提供了关于大气高层密度等宝贵材料
    苏联向各国作了充分报道
    美国只送去少数观察情报
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：塔斯社莫斯科20日电：根据观测和轨道计算等方面的材料确定，第一个人造地球卫星已经在1月4日落到稠密大气层中陨灭。卫星进入稠密大气层中及其燃烧并没有被直接记录到。从12月28日到1月5日苏联各地传来一些看到发光体飞行的消息，这些都只是流星，因为它们出现的地点和时间与卫星的轨道平面是不相符的。
    1957年10月4日发射的、最初以九十六点二分的时间围绕地球运转一周、轨道距离地面最大高度达九百五十公里的第一个人造地球卫星，作为一个宇宙体，存在了九十二昼夜。在这段时期内，第一个人造地球卫星围绕地球运行了一千四百圈，飞过了约六千万公里的路程，等于在火星离地球最近的时候从地球到火星的距离。
    对第一个人造卫星的观察提供了关于大气高层和人造地球卫星运行规律的珍贵的科学情报。
    塔斯社记者从苏联国际地球物理年委员会获悉，苏联科学家关于卫星存在时间的计算是完全正确的。对卫星运行的仔细观察，苏联数学家所创造的方法和快速电子计算机的运用，使我们有可能准确地预告了卫星在每一瞬间的位置。
    在第一个卫星运行期间所进行的观测，使我们收集到了有关大气高层密度、电离层构造和其他地球物理现象的宝贵科学材料。卫星上波长为十五公尺的讯号在超过视线范围很远的距离内都可以收到，在许多场合下，这个距离达到一万公里。研究卫星讯号的结果，发现了在某些电离层内形成一种独特的、使无线电波易于传到很远距离的波导。
    已经确定，实际上流星的危险比从前所预料的要小。卫星曾经在一些流星群中通过，尽管如此，在长时期内依然没有受到损害。卫星所处的温度条件已经查明了。根据观测第一个卫星飞行的初步结果，准确地确定了第二个人造卫星和它的轨道的参数。
    苏联国际地球物理年委员会采取了措施，向各国科学家和广大居民充分报道了用世界上第一个人造天体进行的实验的最重要的特点。
    早在卫星发射之前，科学杂志上就刊载了许多文章，详细地描写了在卫星飞行的时候所用的试验方法和相应的仪器。在许多无线电爱好者杂志中，预先发表了许多描写接收卫星讯号的无线电接收装置的文章，在天文学的出版物中，出版了一些指导光学观测的材料。
    有关卫星发射的种种问题在苏联各种一般刊物和科学刊物上曾经展开了广泛的讨论。
    这样，世界各国就都有可能组织对卫星的观测。
    许多国家的观测站和无线电爱好者对搜集卫星飞行资料的工作有过很大的帮助。苏联国际地球物理年委员会收到了许许多多关于观测情况的信件和电报。捷克斯洛伐克、中华人民共和国、波兰、德意志民主共和国和其他人民民主国家的科学家提供了宝贵的材料。爱尔兰、英国和拉丁美洲的某些国家的天文台和观测站提供了它们的观测情况。
    与此同时，拥有准备工作做得很好的大量观测站的美国，却只送来了少数情报。
    现在，苏联国际地球物理年委员会根据所承担的义务，准备好了关于卫星飞行的初步科学报告，并且正在分送给各个国际地球物理年组织。
