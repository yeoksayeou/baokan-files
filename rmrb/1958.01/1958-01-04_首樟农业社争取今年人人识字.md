Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 3rd: The Shou Zhang Agricultural Cooperative in Zhouning County, Fujian Province, a revolutionary old base area where almost the entire village was illiterate four years ago, has now enabled 61% of its young and middle-aged people to basically escape illiteracy by adhering to literacy work in conjunction with production. Currently, among the 107 households with 348 people in the cooperative, 104 are students in the people's schools, and 38 households have all their members attending school.

The main experience of the Shou Zhang Cooperative's people's schools in maintaining teaching and consolidating the enthusiasm of its members for learning over the past four years is to closely integrate literacy work with production. Young people who can concentrate on learning are concentrated in the people's schools for teaching by village, and those who cannot concentrate are organized to learn by production team. Some women who cannot attend the people's school have teachers from the people's school and students with higher levels of education deliver words to their homes every three to five days. The teaching content is arranged according to the agricultural season, implementing learning what is done, learning to read and write, learning abacus calculation, and learning politics and production technology. In this way, the students' enthusiasm for learning is always high, and the people's schools do not stop classes during the busy farming season, achieving the goal of learning, production, and meetings without any delay.

Now, the Shou Zhang Agricultural Cooperative has included the plan to learn culture into the agricultural cooperative's production plan and the members' family plan, striving to achieve a double harvest of production and culture in 1958, and basically achieve universal literacy.

    争取今年人人识字
    新华社福州3日电　四年前几乎全村都是文盲的福建省革命老根据地周宁县首樟农业社，由于坚持结合生产进行扫盲工作，现在已有61％的青壮年基本上脱离了文盲状态。现在全社一百零七户三百四十八人中，民校学员占一百零四人，有三十八户全家上学。
    首樟社的民校四年来能够坚持教学、巩固社员学习情绪的主要经验，是扫盲工作紧密结合生产。能集中学习的青年就以村为单位集中到民校教学，不能集中的以生产小队为单位组织学习。有的妇女不能上民校，便由民校教师和程度较高的学员每隔三、五天挨家送字上门。教学内容根据农事季节来安排，实行作什么学什么，学识字也学打算盘，学政治也学生产技术。这样，学员们的学习情绪始终高涨，民校在农忙也不停课，作到学习、生产和开会三不误。
    现在，首樟农业社已把学习文化的计划列入农业社生产计划和社员家庭计划，争取1958年实现生产文化两丰收，基本上达到人人识字。
