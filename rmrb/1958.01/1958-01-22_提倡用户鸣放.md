    Advocate for User Feedback
    Qian Yin
    Those who are modest and enterprising are always good at drawing on collective wisdom.
    The Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has invited user departments to the factory to speak out freely, preparing to concentrate on users' opinions as the basis for improving work. This is a new method and deserves attention.
    Production departments and user departments are constituent parts of the socialist economy as a whole. The business activities of each production unit are bound to be related to many aspects and units. Because the needs of one party and the other are different, contradictions will inevitably arise. This is not surprising. The problem is to overcome and resolve these contradictions with a positive attitude, so that our entire cause continues to advance and the level continues to improve.
    The contradiction between production departments and user departments is constant. The relationship between Party A and Party B in basic construction is like this, and so is the relationship between transportation departments and shippers. The relationship between the machinery industry, light industry, textile industry, raw material industry and other departments and users is the same. Since it is related to thousands of users, it is difficult to imagine that these users have no opinions on the production departments. It is certain that there are opinions. How to treat these opinions? Should we let it accumulate into a pile and the work remain unimproved for a long time? Or should we universally invite users to also speak out freely, so as to seek a solution to the problem? There is no question that the latter is the correct approach. The Changxindian Vehicle Repair Factory adopted this method and achieved good results.
    It is recommended that all production, construction, and transportation departments try this method where possible to further improve production.

    提倡用户鸣放
    千音
    虚心进取的人，总是善于集思广益的。
    长辛店机车车辆修理工厂，邀请使用部门来厂大鸣大放，准备集中用户的意见作为改进工作的依据，这是一个新的方法，值得重视。
    生产部门和使用部门，是社会主义经济整体的构成部分。每个生产单位的业务活动，必然要和许许多多方面、单位发生联系。由于一方和另一方的需求不同，必然会产生矛盾。这是不足为奇的。问题是要用积极的态度克服和解决这些矛盾。使我们整个的事业不断前进，水平不断提高。
    生产部门和使用部门的矛盾是经常存在的。基本建设中的甲乙双方关系是如此，运输部门和货主的关系也是如此。机械工业、轻工业、纺织工业、原材料工业等等部门同用户的关系，都是如此。既然同成千成万的用户发生关系，很难想像这些用户对生产部门没有意见。肯定地说，意见是有的。怎么对待这些意见呢？是让它积攒成堆、工作长期无改进呢？还是普遍地邀请用户也来个大鸣大放，从而求得解决问题呢？毫无问题，后者才是正确的办法。长辛店车辆修理厂采取了这个办法，收到了很好的效果。
    建议一切生产、建设和运输部门，在可能条件下，都来试一试这个办法，以进一步改进生产。
