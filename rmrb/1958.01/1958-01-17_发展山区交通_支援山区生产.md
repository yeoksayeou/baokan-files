Developing Mountain Area Transportation is an Important Condition for Developing Mountain Area Production

The underdevelopment of the mountain economy is greatly related to inconvenient transportation. Generally speaking, areas with convenient transportation experience faster production development and more significant improvements in people's lives. Areas with inconvenient transportation and difficult transportation experience slower production development and poorer people's lives.

However, the transportation conditions in mountainous areas can be improved. For example, Ji County in Hebei Province, due to the importance attached by leaders and reliance on the masses over the years, has vigorously built local roads and now basically completed the county's various road networks. As a result, the people's lives in this county have been significantly improved. Taking truck freight as an example, in 1950 it was six to eight yuan per ton-kilometer, but now it has dropped to thirty cents; before the road construction, the total value of local specialties purchased was about 1.4 million yuan per year, and after the road construction, it increased to about 7.3 million yuan in 1956; the daily necessities for people's lives, just cotton cloth alone, increased five times compared to before the road construction. Due to the development of transportation, the people in mountainous areas have reduced expenses, increased income, and improved their lives. Therefore, vigorously developing transportation in mountainous areas is a fundamental issue for developing production in mountainous areas, revitalizing the mountain economy, and improving the lives of the people in mountainous areas.

Since liberation, especially after the promulgation of the draft National Agricultural Development Program, local transportation departments have initially attached importance to developing transportation in mountainous areas and supporting production in mountainous areas, and have achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics, in 1956 alone, provinces built more than 11,500 kilometers of highways, more than 72,200 kilometers of simple roads, more than 45,000 kilometers of cart roads, and more than 8,000 kilometers of pack animal trails, making some previously交通 blocked areas accessible and changing the face of transportation. After several years of efforts by local transportation departments and the active participation of the masses, transportation has been improved to a certain extent, and the uneven distribution of roads has also changed to a certain extent. For example, taking 1952 as the base year, by the end of 1956, highways in coastal areas increased by more than 50%, mountainous areas increased by more than 80%, and border and minority areas increased by about 230%. From 1956 to 1957, 201 counties changed from not having access to automobiles to having access to automobiles, of which 170 were in mountainous areas. From a national perspective, the mileage of highways and simple roads has developed from 75,000 kilometers in 1949 to more than 250,000 kilometers in 1957. The total navigable mileage of inland rivers in the country has also developed from more than 70,000 kilometers before liberation to more than 110,000 kilometers in 1957. This has played a significant role in revitalizing the rural economy, connecting urban and rural material exchanges, and improving people's lives.

However, in terms of the density of roads across the country and the utilization of natural rivers, it is still far from meeting the needs of production development. Transportation in many areas, especially deep mountainous areas and remote mountainous areas, is still very inconvenient, and some are still in a state of closure. There are still more than 120 mountainous counties in the country that do not have access to automobiles. For example, in the Qinling and Daba Mountains, there are eight counties without highways and without the use of rivers, and six of them do not even have pack animal trails, relying entirely on manual porterage. For example, Tongjiang County in Sichuan Province has 100 million catties of grain that are difficult to transfer out, and it would take six years to transport it all by human porterage. There are more than 320,000 kilometers of natural waterways in the country, but only more than 110,000 kilometers are navigable, and more than 210,000 kilometers have not been utilized. Most of these rivers are in mountainous areas, and if they are slightly improved, they can be navigable or seasonally navigable.

The Key Lies in Leadership Attention and Reliance on the Masses

Building transportation in mountainous areas is an urgent and arduous task. Opening up transportation in mountainous areas is one of the important contents of the entire work in mountainous areas. Because transportation construction involves a wide range of aspects, especially when state investment is insufficient and it is necessary to rely on the masses and use local materials, it is essential that the responsible persons of party and government at all levels in mountainous areas personally grasp it. This is the key to changing the current state of transportation in mountainous areas. For example, party and government at all levels in Gansu Province have included transportation work on the important agenda, personally studying and discussing it at any time. From the province to the county, a deputy secretary and administrative负责人 person personally manage transportation work. Most of the special districts and counties have a leader serving as deputy who is personally responsible for the overall leadership. Therefore, the province has achieved significant results in building roads in mountainous areas. In 1956, Wudu Special District built more than 560 kilometers of roads in mountainous areas, and the Wuwen Highway alone had more than 270,000 cubic meters of stone. According to legend, this was the "Yinping Road" of the Three Kingdoms period, and the Kuomintang reactionaries tried to repair it several times without success, but under the strong leadership of the Wudu Special District Party and government, it was fully opened to traffic in just eight months, with an average speed of 26 kilometers per hour; the investment was 610,000 yuan, an average of more than 4,100 yuan per kilometer, which fully complied with the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical. For example, Ji County in Hebei Province has become a model county for road construction, also because the county party committee and county magistrate have always attached importance to transportation work and personally led it. Similar situations are common in various provinces and regions.

It is also necessary to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for "letting rivers yield the way and mountains bow their heads," and their high enthusiasm for road construction and river management to build local transportation. Building transportation in mountainous areas, building roads on high mountains and steep ridges, and making navigation possible on rapid rivers and dangerous waters are certainly difficult, but as long as we follow the mass line and rely on the inexhaustible power of the masses, any difficulty can be overcome. In particular, after the promulgation of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, a high tide of large-scale production movements has been set off in various places. Many facts have proved that following the mass line can turn difficult things into easy things, and things that cost a lot of money into things that cost less money. Although the state has paid attention to local transportation issues in the past, state investment can only be used to build the most important economic trunk lines and defense lines. As for local roads, branch lines, and small rivers, it is mainly necessary to rely on local investment and the labor force of farmers. Civilian labor construction is a huge force and guarantee for building local transportation, and it is also an effective method that has been practiced in various places. Now the collectivization of agriculture and the collectivization of private transportation tools have been basically realized throughout the country, which has prepared more favorable conditions for mobilizing the masses. When mobilizing civilian labor for construction, we must promote the socialist spirit of mutual assistance among the masses and overcome unfavorable conditions such as the small population and difficult work in mountainous areas, so that the masses can realize that only by building good transportation can they get rid of the backward and poor situation in mountainous areas. Closely linking the work of building local transportation with the construction of a happy life for the people in mountainous areas, road construction and river management will surely receive enthusiastic support from the broad masses, and arduous tasks will surely be completed smoothly.

Adapt to Local Conditions and Use Local Materials

Building transportation in mountainous areas must implement the policy of building the country industriously and thriftily with more, faster, better, and more economical results. The situation in mountainous areas is very complicated, and the geographical and economic conditions are different, so it is necessary to adopt various methods in accordance with local conditions to meet the requirements of objective reality. Generally speaking, areas with abundant resources, large reserves of timber, rich mineral deposits, and plans to build industries in the near future should open up simple roads or improve rivers in a planned way to meet transportation needs. Areas where resources are concentrated and mineral deposits are rich, but located in deep mountains and remote mountains, and where there are no plans to build industries and develop forestry in the near future, should first open up horse cart roads or handcart roads and improve rivers that can be used by wooden sailboats. Areas where resources are scattered and located in deep mountains should first seek to have roads, open up pedestrian paths, pack animal trails, or use small boats and bamboo rafts, and then gradually improve them with the development of production. In areas of deep mountains and steep ridges where materials must be transported out, we must also vigorously try out and promote various aerial ropeways and soil slides, and not allow difficulties in individual sections to affect overall production and the construction of the entire transportation system. In short, we should be realistic, adapt to local conditions, adapt to the circumstances, build in stages, gradually improve, use local materials, and save funds and manpower to achieve cost-effectiveness, economic efficiency, and practicality.

Give Priority to River Management and Development of Shipping

In areas where rivers can be utilized, it is necessary to pay attention to giving priority to the favorable conditions of rivers, actively developing and improving rivers, and developing shipping. There are many inland rivers in our country, especially in provinces south of the Yellow River, where rainfall is abundant, rivers flow year-round, and they do not freeze throughout the year. It is very advantageous to develop water transportation. Building one kilometer of railway requires the use of 30 to 40 acres of land, and one kilometer of simple road also requires the use of 10 to 20 acres of land. In terms of investment, one kilometer of railway requires an investment of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, and one kilometer of highway requires an investment of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Taking the example of Wudu Special District in Gansu Province building simple roads, excluding civilian labor construction, each kilometer requires an investment of more than 4,000 yuan. However, river management not only saves land, but is also generally more economical in terms of investment. Taking Sichuan Province as an example, the province has managed a total of 15 small river tributaries with a total length of more than 1,400 kilometers in recent years, with a total investment of 540,000 yuan, an average investment of only 378 yuan per kilometer, which is only one thirty-sixth of the investment in building simple roads in the province, and only one-tenth of the investment in building highways in Wudu Special District of Gansu Province. In terms of transportation tools, the cost of building a small wooden sailboat of 3 to 5 tons that travels on small rivers is only 60 to 200 yuan, which is less than the investment in carts, flatbeds, and animal-powered vehicles, and even less than the investment in automobiles. After the river is opened, the average freight rate per ton-kilometer is about one dime, which is more than half less than that of automobiles. Therefore, in areas where rivers can be utilized, we should first improve the rivers as much as possible. Under the principle of spending less money and achieving greater results, we should make full use of the available rivers, deepen waterways, reduce flow rates, clear obstacles, and facilitate navigation according to transportation needs and river possibilities. It is good to have year-round navigation on the entire river, and it is also good to have segmented and seasonal navigation.

In rivers with concentrated materials, heavy transportation, and developed industries and mining, it is also necessary and beneficial to focus on small-scale canalization projects. For example, the Guanjian River in Sichuan Province could not be fully navigable before. The total length is 175 kilometers. The drop of 23 kilometers from Taian to Niutan in the lower reaches is more than 2 meters, and the 27 kilometers from Niutai to Anju can only be navigated in sections. Grain and local specialties in the middle and upper reaches are transported to Taian by water, and then transferred to Tongnan by car, and then transported out by the Fujiang River. There is no access to Taian to Niutan by car or boat, and it is entirely dependent on human porterage, which is very inconvenient. In 1956, 50 kilometers of waterways were canalized in the lower reaches, and two double-stage ship locks and five single-stage ship locks were built, eliminating shoals and rapids. After connecting the upper and lower sections, the river was unobstructed. More than 20,000 tons of materials can be transported annually, and the freight rate has been reduced by about 60%, saving more than 300,000 yuan in freight annually. The total investment in the canalization of Guanjian River was 213,000 yuan, with an average investment of 4,260 yuan per kilometer. The annual savings in freight exceeded the total investment. Such river canalization is necessary. In the future, under the principle of comprehensive planning and comprehensive utilization in various places, combined with farmland, water conservancy, and power generation, the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects can further exert the rich capabilities of rivers, enabling the local economy to develop comprehensively and changing the economic face of mountainous areas.

Correctly Master Freight Rate Policies

Freight rates are an important part of the state's price policy. Correct freight rates can promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, improve the management of transportation departments, implement the overall planning and appropriate arrangement of various transportation tools, and at the same time, it is also an important weapon to promote industrial and agricultural production. In recent years, various places have achieved certain results in implementing and adjusting freight rates, and the gradual reduction of freight rates has also saved the state freight expenditures. However, there are also some shortcomings in the implementation of freight rates. For example, in the case of different road conditions, it is rigidly stipulated to implement a freight rate; some places stipulate excessively high freight rates, hindering the transportation of local specialties, and stimulating the blind development of散车 loose trucks, forming undue internal contradictions in transportation. Some places stipulate excessively low freight rates, affecting the work of transportation departments, especially the full play of private transportation tools. In adjusting freight rates, the phenomenon that the important role of freight rates in the national economy cannot be fully utilized is quite common. For example, in recent years, local specialties in mountainous areas cannot be transported out, and no transportation tools go to mountainous areas, while the transportation capacity of large rivers is surplus, but the freight rate policy does not give appropriate consideration to small river freight rates, so it cannot encourage ships to develop toward small rivers. For example, in the case where a certain local specialty cannot bear the higher freight rate, it cannot get the support of preferential freight rates, so it has long formed goods abandoned on the ground, hindering the development of production, and even causing it to decline.

Now, production in mountainous areas is generally backward, and the lives of people in mountainous areas are relatively poor. We must support the development of production in mountainous areas in all aspects. In order to enable local specialties in mountainous areas to be transported out, it is necessary to build various roads and manage tributaries and small rivers in mountainous areas. At the same time, when stipulating freight rates, we must take into account the affordability of local specialties in mountainous areas, so that transportation departments can make profits and at the same time take into account that local specialties in mountainous areas can go out of the mountains and into the cities. Therefore, when stipulating freight rates, we must specifically understand the production of various materials and the ability to bear freight, so that those materials that can afford freight can bear more, and those materials that cannot afford freight can bear less. From the freight rate of individual materials, transportation is losing money, but from the calculation of freight rates for all materials, there is a surplus. As long as various places attach importance to the stipulation of freight rates, frequently study them, and reasonably adjust them according to actual conditions, the contradiction between transportation business and mountain production can be resolved.

In the early stage of insufficient development of mountain production, transportation work in mountainous areas is seasonal. In order to adapt to these characteristics, it is necessary to organize seasonal transportation. During the off-season, the masses engaged in transportation work can engage in agricultural production or farmers can engage in transportation work during the slack season to reduce the freight expenses of materials in mountainous areas and increase the income of transportation cooperatives. In particular, in mountainous areas with small transportation volumes, it is necessary for agriculture and transportation to be secondary industries to each other. If there is no need to separate them, do not separate them. If they can be combined, combine them. Adapt to local conditions, adapt to the circumstances, and achieve the development of production and economic prosperity in mountainous areas.

    发展山区交通　支援山区生产
    张文昂
    发展山区交通是发展山区生产的重要条件
    山区经济不发达与交通不便有很大关系。一般来说，凡是交通方便的地区生产的发展比较快，人民生活的改善也比较显著；交通不便运输困难的地区，生产发展就比较缓慢，人民生活也比较贫困。
    但是山区的交通条件是可以改善的。例如河北省蓟县，历年来由于领导重视，依靠群众，大力修建了地方道路，现在基本上完成了县的各种道路网。因此这个县的人民生活得到显著的改善，以大车运费为例，1950年每吨公里是六元到八元，目前已降到三角；修路前土特产的收购总值每年是一百四十万元左右，修路后，1956年增加到七百三十万元左右；人民生活日用品仅棉布一项就比修路前增加了五倍。由于交通的发展，山区人民减少了开支，增加了收入，改善了生活。因此，大力发展山区交通是发展山区生产，繁荣山区经济，改善山区人民生活的一个根本问题。
    解放以来，特别是全国农业发展纲要草案公布以后，地方交通部门对发展山区交通，支援山区生产已初步重视起来，而且取得了很大成绩。据不完全统计，各省在1956年一年内，修建公路一万一千五百多公里，简易公路七万二千二百多公里。大车道四万五千多公里，驮道八千多公里，使一部分交通闭塞的地区有路可通，改变了交通面貌。经过几年来的地方交通部门的努力与群众的积极参加，使交通有了一定的改善，也使道路分布的不均衡状态有了一定的变化。如以1952年为基数，到1956年底，沿海地区增加公路50％以上，山区增加80％以上，边疆及少数民族地区增加230％左右。在1956年至1957年内，有二百零一个县由原来不通汽车变为通汽车，其中一百七十个县是在山区。从全国来看，公路和简易公路的通车里程已由1949年的七万五千公里发展为1957年的二十五万多公里。全国内河的通航里程，也由解放前的七万多公里发展为1957年的十一万多公里。这对繁荣农村经济，沟通城乡物资交流，改善人民生活，都起了重大的作用。
    但从全国道路的密度来看，从自然河流的利用来看，都还远远的不能满足生产发展的需要，有很多地区特别是深山区与远山区交通仍然十分不便，有的还处于闭塞状态。全国现在仍有一百二十多个山区县不通汽车。如秦岭和大巴山地区，就有八个县没有公路，也没有利用河流，其中六个县连驮道都没有，全靠人力背运。如四川省通江县就有一亿斤粮食难以调出，靠人背要六年时间才能运完。全国自然河道三十二万多公里，现在能通航的仅十一万多公里，还有二十一万多公里没有利用。这些河道的绝大部分都在山区，如果稍加整治，就可通航或季节通航。
        关键在于领导重视与依靠群众
    建设山区交通是一个迫切而又艰巨的任务。开辟山区交通工作，是整个山区工作的重要内容之一。因为交通建设工作牵涉的面很广，特别是在国家投资不足，需要依靠群众，就地取材的情况下，非要山区的各级党政负责人亲自掌握不可。这是改变目前山区交通面貌的关键。如甘肃省各级党政都把交通工作列入重要的议事日程，随时亲自研究讨论，由省到县都有一位副书记及行政负责人亲自管理交通工作，绝大部分的专区和县都有一个担任副职的领导人亲自担任总的领导，因此这个省修建山区道路就获得了显著的成绩。1956年武都专区修建山区道路五百六十多公里，仅武文公路就有石方二十七万多立方公尺。据传说这是三国时代的“阴平道”，国民党反动派时期修了几次都未修通，而在武都专区党政的坚强领导下，仅八个月就完全通车，时速平均达到二十六公里；投资六十一万元，平均每公里四千一百多元，完全符合又多又快又好又省的方针。又如河北省蓟县成为筑路模范县，也是由于历年来县委县长一直重视交通工作，亲自领导的结果。各省区类似的情况也很多。
    还要依靠群众，发动群众“让河水让道，高山低头”的积极性与高度的修路治河的热情，才能把地方交通建设起来。建设山区交通，要在高山峻岭上修路，在急流险水上通航是有一定困难的，但只要走群众路线，依靠群众无穷无尽的力量，任何困难也是可以克服的。特别是全国农业发展纲要修正草案公布以后，各地掀起了大生产运动高潮。许多事实证明走群众路线可以把困难的事情变为容易的事情，多花钱的事情变为少花钱的事情。国家在交通方面，过去虽然已经注意到地方交通问题，但国家投资只能用于修建最重要的经济干线和国防要线。至于地方道路，支线小河，主要的还是要靠地方投资和农民的劳动力。民工建勤是建设地方交通的巨大力量与保证，也是各地已经行之有效的办法。现在全国已经基本上实现了农业合作化和民间运输工具合作化，这就给发动群众准备了更为有利的条件。我们在动员民工建勤时一定要发扬群众社会主义的互助精神，克服山区人口较少工作较难等不利条件，使群众认识到只有修好交通，才能摆脱山区落后贫困的境况。把建设地方交通工作与建设山区人民的幸福生活紧密的结合起来，修路治河一定会取得广大群众热烈的拥护，艰巨的任务也必将顺利完成。
            因地制宜，就地取材
    建设山区交通必须贯彻又多又快又好又省的勤俭建国方针。山区的情况非常复杂，地理条件和经济条件各不相同，因此必须因地制宜地采取多种多样的办法，才能适应客观实际的要求。一般的说来，凡是资源丰富，或林木蕴藏量大，矿藏多，有近期兴建工业计划的地区，应有计划地开辟简易公路或整治河道，适应运输的要求。资源虽然集中，矿藏也丰富，但地处深山远山，在最近的将来还没有建设工业和开发林业的计划的地区，应先开辟马车路或手推车路，整治能通行木帆船的河道。资源分散，地处深山的地区，应先求有路可通，开辟人行道，驮道，或使用小船竹筏，以后随着生产的发展逐步改善。在深山峻岭但又有物资必须运出来的地区，也要大力试办和推广各种架空索道、土滑道，不要因个别地段的困难影响全面生产与整个交通的建设。总之应实事求是，因地制宜，因事制宜，分期修建，逐步提高，就地取材，节省资金、民力，达到费省效宏，经济适用。
            尽先治理河道发展航运
    在有河流可资利用的地区，注重尽先利用河流的有利条件，积极开发和改善河流发展航运，是十分必要的。我国内河很多，特别在黄河以南各省，雨量充沛，河水长流，终年不冻，发展水运是十分有利的。修建一公里铁路，要使用三十到四十亩土地，一公里简易公路也得使用十亩到二十亩的土地。在投资方面一公里铁路要投资四、五十万元，一公里公路要投资四、五万元。以甘肃武都专区修建简易公路的范例来说，除民工建勤不计外，每公里也得投资四千多元。可是治理河道，不但节省土地，在投资上一般也比较经济。以四川省为例，该省几年来共治理小河支流十五条，长一千四百多公里，共投资五十四万元，平均每公里投资仅三百七十八元，只相当于该省修建简易公路投资的三十六分之一，只有甘肃武都专区修公路投资的十分之一。在运输工具上，行驶小河的三吨至五吨小木帆船造价只需六十至二百元，比架车、板车和兽力车等投资也少，比汽车投资就更少了。河道修通以后，航运运价每吨公里平均大约为一角多钱，比汽车的少一半以上。因此，凡是有河流可资利用的地区，应尽先把河流加以整治。在花钱少，收效大的原则下，把可以利用的河流，尽量利用起来，根据运输需要与河道的可能，加深航道，降低流速，清理障碍，便利航行，能全年全河通航固好，能分段分季通航也好。
    在物资集中，运输繁重，工矿发达的河流上，重点进行小型渠化工程也是必要的和有利的。如四川省关溅河以前不能全部通航，全长一百七十五公里，下游泰安至牛滩二十三公里的落差都在二公尺以上，牛泰至安居二十七公里也只能分段通航，中上游的粮食和土特产水运到泰安后，得另转汽车运至潼南，再由涪江运出。泰安至牛滩车船都不通，全靠人力背运，非常不便。1956年在下游渠化五十公里的航道，修了两座双级船闸和五座单级船闸，消灭了滩险激流，把上下段连接起来以后，河道畅通无阻，每年可以运物资二万多吨，运价降低了60％左右，每年可节约运费三十多万元。关溅河全部渠化投资为二十一万三千元，每公里平均投资为四千二百六十元，一年节约运费即超过了全部投资。类似这样的河流渠化是必要的。今后在各地全面规划，综合利用的原则下与农田、水利、发电事业相结合，进行小型水利工程建设，就能更进一步地发挥河流的丰富的能力，使地方经济得到全面的发展，从而改变山区的经济面貌。
              正确掌握运价政策
    运价是国家价格政策的一个重要组成部分，正确的运价可以促进城乡物资交流，提高运输部门的经营管理，贯彻统筹兼顾，适当安排各种运输工具的重要手段，同时也是促进工农业生产的一个重要武器。几年来各地在执行与调整运价方面已取得了一定成绩，并且由于运价的逐年降低，也给国家节省了运费开支。但在执行运价中也存在着一些缺点。如在道路条件不同的情况下，却硬性规定执行一个运价；有的地方规定运价偏高，阻碍了土特产的运出，并刺激了散车的盲目发展，形成运输上不应有的内部矛盾。有的地方规定运价偏低，影响了运输部门工作，特别是民间运输工具的充分发挥。在调整运价时，没有能够充分发挥运价在国民经济中的重要作用的现象相当普遍。如几年来山区的土特产运不出来，没有运输工具到山区去，大河的运输能力却过剩，而在运价政策上没有适当的照顾小河运价，这样就不能鼓励船舶面向小河发展。又如在某种土特产负担不了较高的运价的情况下，得不到优待运价的支持，因此长期形成货弃于地，妨碍生产的发展，甚至使之下降。
    现在山区生产，一般是落后的，山区人民的生活，比较起来是贫困的。我们必须从各方面支援山区生产的发展。为了使山区的土特产能够运出来，修建各种道路，治理山区支流小河是必要的，同时在规定运价时一定要照顾到山区土特产的负担能力，既要使运输部门有利可图，同时也要照顾山区土特产能够出山、入城。因此在规定运价时就要具体了解各种物资生产情况和负担运费的能力，使那些能够负担运费的物资，多负担一些，使那些没有负担能力的物资，少负担一些。从个别物资的运价看来，运输是赔钱的，但从所有物资运价计算起来，却是有盈余的。只要各地把运价的规定重视起来，经常加以研究，根据实际情况，合理调整，运输业务与山区生产的矛盾是可以解决的。
    在山区生产还不够发展的初期，山区的运输工作是有季节性的。为了适应这些特点，就需要组织季节运输，在运输淡季，使从事运输工作的群众兼事农业生产或使农民在农闲时从事运输工作，以减轻山区物资的运费开支，增加运输合作社的收入。特别是运输量不大的山区，农业与运输业互为副业是必要的，不需要分的就不要分，能够合的就合起来，因地制宜，因事制宜，达到山区的生产发展，经济繁荣。
