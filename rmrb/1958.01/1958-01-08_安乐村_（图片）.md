“Anle Village”

Henan Province's Dengfeng County is located at the foot of Mount Song, one of China's famous Five Great Mountains. The county has thin soil and many rocks, and experiences drought nine years out of ten. In the rare good years, when the millet ripens, sparrows compete with people for the harvest; after it's brought home, rats compete with people for food. In the past, this place was poor, backward, and dirty.

After Dengfeng County achieved cooperativization at the end of 1955, the Dengfeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party launched a sanitation, fertilizer accumulation, and "four pests" eradication campaign centered on production. The first step was to improve the cleanliness of streets and toilets. This eliminated places for mosquitoes and flies to hide and breed, thus eliminating and reducing various infectious diseases.

Jingdian Village used to have piles of manure in front of every household. Since the development of the sanitation, fertilizer accumulation, and "four pests" eradication campaign centered on production, the village has become a clean, tidy, and beautiful "Anle Village."

    “安乐村”
    河南省登封县在我国著名的五岳中的中岳——嵩山脚下，全县土薄石厚，十年九旱。如有个好年景，谷子熟了则麻雀与人争收；收到家里，老鼠又与人争吃。过去这里是贫困、落后而又肮脏的。
    1955年底登封县实现合作化以后，中共登封县委便发动群众开展以生产为中心的卫生、积肥、除“四害”运动，首先作好街道、厕所等清洁卫生工作。因此消灭了蚊蝇躲藏和繁殖的地方，也就消灭和减少了各种传染病。
    景店村，从前家家户户门前都有粪堆，自从开展以生产为中心的卫生积肥除“四害”运动后，该村成为清洁卫生，整齐美观的“安乐村”了。
