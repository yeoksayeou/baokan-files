    The Heroic Undertaking
    Du Pengcheng
    For anyone, the first time riding a train speeding along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is an extraordinary experience. As the train rises sharply from the plains to the cloud-wreathed mountains, you can't help but marvel at the magical power of humanity. As the train passes through tunnel after tunnel, racing and rumbling deep within the earth, you feel a heart-stirring sensation. When you see station after station, you might not imagine that people once moved mountain after mountain to clear this small space.
    The first Five-Year Plan has passed. In these few years, the sweat of hundreds of thousands of railway workers has soaked every inch of land the railway passes through. Day and night, there have been countless heroic deeds and ingenious creations, countless anxious explorations and sleepless nights.
    Who can forget: the heroes who had just completed the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, before they could catch their breath, carried shovels and explosives into the Dabashan Mountains. Here, wild beasts roamed in packs, and the sound of mosquitoes was like thunder. When you parted the jungle and weeds, you could see the ancient sheep trails. The stones on these trails had been worn smooth by the soles of our ancestors' shoes. Looking up, on the towering, moss-covered cliffs, there were the remains of ancient plank roads.
    Who can forget: those railway workers who returned from the Korean railway transportation line, the smell of gunpowder still lingering on their bodies, came to the Qinling Mountains with three feet of snow.
    Although this world-rare railway project was extremely arduous, although all leading cadres and technicians had not dealt with such complex natural conditions, although the vast majority of workers had just put down their guns or farm tools, and didn’t know how to start work, since history had placed the burden of construction on their shoulders, they shouldered this heavy burden with unparalleled heroism and marched forward resolutely!
    In the early days of the project, hundreds of thousands of workers were scattered among the thousands of mountains and ridges, giving a sense of insignificance. Compared to the undulating mountains and the roaring rivers, people seemed so small! Countless pickaxes swung! The heroic undertaking began at their feet, but in the freezing weather, a single blow with a pickaxe could only dig up a fist-sized piece of soil, and upon looking at their hands, their "tiger's mouth" was cracked! Blood stained the handle of the pickaxe red. You might doubt: can mountains really be made to bow their heads with this method? Late at night, you walk into the newly excavated tunnel, only to see many workers sitting in the mud, hammering steel drills. With one hammer blow, sparks fly, and with another, a mark one or two fen deep is left on the stone. You can't help but ask yourself, how many years and months will it take to tunnel through the Qinling and Dabashan Mountains, hundreds of kilometers wide, with this hammer blow after hammer blow? But when you gaze at the workers' serious and resolute faces and their confident posture, a spirit of heroism infects you, and your heart surges. Therefore, you will also believe with full confidence: with these two all-powerful hands, people can certainly overcome cliffs and precipices and the rushing Jialing River... Day after day, year after year, the momentum of the march towards nature grows more and more violent. The sound of blasting mountains, the roar of machines, and the shouts of workers startle the mountains. The difficult heroic undertaking is advancing at an astonishing pace.
    This is an incredibly intense combat life. The boundaries between day and night have disappeared. Railway workers have devoted all their thoughts, feelings, and energy to this magnificent undertaking. Everyone is calculating meticulously: what new things has he added to the world in every minute?
    I cannot forget Comrade Xiong Yuzhong, the leader who commanded the construction of the entire Baoji-Chengdu Railway. This is an energetic person who works selflessly. For several years, he has been living a very stressful life. Countless things, sudden emergencies on the construction site, meeting after meeting, telegrams, documents, and dizzying numbers, all weighed on him. He wished he could be in several places at once, handling a hundred things at the same time. Every day is an extraordinary day for him. When the sky is cloudy, the dark clouds seem to cover his face. In the summer, the scorching sun seems to scorch his skin. When it rains heavily, he cannot sleep or eat, because the vast majority of workers on the railway construction site are engaged in outdoor work, and changes in climate often bring huge difficulties and affect the progress of the project. As some cadres say, Comrade Xiong Yuzhong's office is on his legs. He appears sometimes in the work sheds, sometimes on the construction site, sometimes wearing straw sandals, braving the heavy rain, walking hundreds of miles along each work site, studying various problems in construction with the workers. His footprints are left on every inch of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Although the white hair on his head and the wrinkles on his face increase day by day, he feels that being able to work wholeheartedly with the vast number of railway workers for this great construction is an unparalleled honor and joy in life.
    I will never forget Comrade Li Rongcun, Director of the Sixth Engineering Bureau. He is the kind of resilient, silently dedicated person who devotes himself to the cause of socialism. Like all the cadres on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway construction site, he ran around the construction site day and night. In those chaotic and busy days when the road was just starting to be built, he often fainted due to excessive fatigue, but when he woke up, he happily told the people working with him: "Comrades! Continue to work!" as if nothing had happened. Even in that limited time for sleep, he kept talking in his sleep. "Materials... blueprints..." Not to mention, the telephone placed beside his head would wake him up from his dreams from time to time, constantly sending him various problems in the construction. Later, when leading cadres at all levels learned to manage production, when technicians learned a set of skills in practical exercises, and workers learned to skillfully use the tools in their hands, the chaotic situation ended, everything on the construction site was in good order, and work efficiency was several times higher than in the past. At this time, when people talked about his selfless dedication in the early stages of construction, he always smiled it off, as if to indicate: everything he experienced was ordinary and insignificant.
    I will never forget: In June 1956, the rainy season came early, and in the thousands of gullies and valleys of the Qinling and Dabashan Mountains, the surging floods were churning. Traffic was cut off, all telephone lines were cut off, and the workers surrounded by floods were trapped in a helpless situation. Several old engineers who lived in the same work shed as me responded to this sudden disaster calmly and bravely, like seasoned veterans. They calmly braved the heavy rain at locations where there was a possibility of sacrifice, directing the workers to work. They worked alongside the workers against the floods for one night after another, one week after another. They continued to work without complaint, even without food.
    At the same time, in the construction site across from our work shed, thousands of workers were also surrounded by floods. Day and night, heavy rain poured down on them. They had no food to eat, and the mountains around them often collapsed, making earth-shattering roars. But they still worked tirelessly. The firelight of exploding cliffs reflected the brilliance of lightning, and the sound of blasting mountains echoed the thunder.
    I will never forget the thousands upon thousands of thatched sheds on the construction site. The workers' wives and children lived in these thatched sheds. In a certain thatched shed, when the road began to be built, the worker's youngest son was still in swaddling clothes. Year after year, this child could follow his mother to the construction site to deliver food. Or, on a night of heavy rain, this child, standing at the entrance of the thatched shed, took advantage of the lightning to identify his father from the countless figures standing on the opposite cliff excavating the mountains. Some workers were swallowed by floods, or suddenly left this world due to landslides. His wife would then carry her child on her back, take over the road-building tools left by her husband, and continue the struggle against the high mountains and great rivers. At this time, if you look at the hardworking labor of these women and their resolute faces, you will know how she turns infinite grief into surging thoughts and inexhaustible strength, and you will see the driving force for the progress of our cause.
    This revolutionary, majestic heroism, this firm belief in turning ideals into reality, is not accidental. I saw Comrade Huang Xinyi, Director of the Second Engineering Bureau, on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway construction site. This is an old soldier, and in every historical era, enemy bullets have left many scars on his body. He often gathered with many workers, gazing at the slogans written on the cliff walls by the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in those years, recalling the fighting of the Fourth Front Army of the Red Army in the Dabashan Mountains, and savoring the stories of the Second Front Army of the Red Army fighting in the Qinling Mountains. He and General He Long commanded the Red Army soldiers in hard struggles in this area. Once, at the Baishuijiang Station, a group of local villagers surrounded him. He said: "Villagers! Do you remember the situation when the Red Army passed through here?" The villagers said: "We remember! A Red Army officer even spoke on the earthen fort over there!" Comrade Huang Xinyi said: "I was the one who spoke. I told you at the time: Now we are fighting local tyrants and distributing land, and in the future, we will build a socialist society. Look! Aren't we busy building a socialist society now?" The villagers all looked at Comrade Huang Xinyi with emotion and deep thought, and then looked at the workers who were building the road.
    Recalling the struggles of the Red Army soldiers in the past, gazing at the labor army attacking nature in front of us, a history of the Chinese people's struggle appears before you. This history is permeated with vivid ideals, unwavering beliefs, and invincible strength, and all of this is also infused into every drop of blood and every cell of the people who are building the railway.
    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway is an immortal poem created by tens of millions of working people in four or five years. This poem writes the immortal feats of the working class. Anyone who takes a train through this railway, whether you are going to work in a distant place, to study, or to visit relatives, when you witness this great project, you cannot help but be grateful to the people who are working bravely to build our motherland.

    英雄的事业
    杜鹏程
    任何人，第一次乘坐奔驰在宝成铁路上的火车，都是一次不平凡的经历。火车从平地陡然升至云雾缭绕的山岭，你就不能不惊叹人的神奇的力量。火车穿过一个个隧道，在地层深处奔驰着，轰响着，你就感到惊心动魄。当你看到一个又一个的站场时，你也许想不到：人们为了开辟这一小块地方，曾经搬去了一座又一座的大山。
    第一个五年计划过去了。在这几年当中，十几万铁路职工们的汗水浸透了这条铁路经过的每一寸土地。日日夜夜，有多少英雄的事迹和智慧的创举，有多少焦灼的摸索和无眠的夜。
    谁能忘记：刚修完成渝铁路的英雄们喘息未定，又抬着铁锹、炸药，进入大巴山区。这里野兽成群，蚊声成雷。你拨开丛林和荒草，便能看见古老的羊肠小道。这些小道上的石头，被我们祖先的鞋底磨得非常圆滑。抬头看，高耸入云的长满青苔的绝壁上，有古栈道的遗迹。
    谁能忘记：那些从朝鲜铁路运输线上回来的铁路工人，身上的硝烟味还没有消退，便来到积雪三尺的秦岭山区。
    虽然这世界罕有的铁路工程甚为艰巨，虽然所有领导干部和技术人员都没有对付过这样复杂的自然情况，虽然绝大部分工人都是刚放下枪杆或者农具，不懂得如何下手工作，可是历史既然把建设的担子放在他们肩上，他们就以无比的英雄气概，挑起这繁重的担子，坚毅地向前迈进！
    在工程开始的时日，十几万工人散布在千山万岭之中，简直有沧海一粟之感。比起那连绵起伏的大山和那奔腾咆哮的江河，人，显得多么渺小！无数的十字镐挥动了！英雄的事业就从脚下开始，可是在天寒地冻的日子里，工人们一镢头下去，只能刨下拳头大的一块土，伸手一看，“虎口”震裂了！血珠染红了镢头把。你会怀疑：难道用这种办法就能让高山低头？深夜时光，你走到刚开挖的隧道里，只见许多工人坐在泥水中，用铁锤打钢钎，一锤下去，火星飞溅，又一锤下去，石头上留下一、二分深的印子，你不禁地问自己，这样一锤又一锤，何年何月才把这横宽数百公里的秦岭和大巴山凿通？但是当你注视着工人们那严肃而坚韧的面孔和那充满信心的姿态，一种英雄的气概就感染得你心胸激荡。于是，你也会信心十足地相信：人们凭着这两只万能的手，一定可以战胜悬崖绝壁和急喘的嘉陵江……。一日复一日，一年复一年，向自然界进军的声势，越来越猛烈。开山的炮声，机器的吼声和工人们的喊声，使这万重山岭团团打惊。艰难的英雄事业，以惊人的速度在前进。
    这是一种无比紧张的战斗生活。白天和黑夜消失了界限。铁路员工们把自己的全部思想感情和精力，都交给了这壮丽的事业。每一个人都在苛刻地计算：在每一分钟里，他给世界上增添了什么新的东西。
    我不能忘记，指挥宝成铁路全线建设的领导者熊宇忠同志。这是个精力充沛忘我劳动的人。几年来，他一直过着非常紧张的生活。无数的事情，工地里突然发生的紧急情况，一个又一个的会议，电报，文件和使人头昏眼花的数字，这一切都压在他身上。他恨不得有分身之术，同时办一百件事情。每天，对他都是不平常的日子。天阴了，阴云仿佛就罩在他脸上，夏日，喷火似的太阳，仿佛在炙烤他的皮肤，大雨瓢泼，他就寝食不安，因为铁路建设工地，绝大部分工人都从事露天作业，气候变化，常常带来巨大的困难，影响工程进度。像有些干部说的一样，熊宇忠同志的办公室就在他腿上。他时而出现在工棚，时而出现在工地，时而穿着草鞋，冒着大雨，沿着一个个的工作地点，步行百余里，跟工人们研究施工中的各种问题。宝成铁路的每寸土地上，都留下他的脚印。他虽然头上的白发和脸上的皱纹一天比一天增加，可是他却觉得能和广大铁路工人一道，为这项伟大的建设而竭心尽力，是人生无比的光荣和愉快。
    我永远不能忘记：第六工程局局长李荣村同志。他是那种坚韧的、默默无声的把自己献给社会主义事业的人。他像宝成铁路工地的所有干部一样，没日没夜在工地奔跑。在刚开始修路的那些混乱而繁忙的日子里，他常常因过分的劳累而昏倒，但是当他苏醒以后，又愉快地告诉一同工作的人：“同志们！继续办事情呀！”仿佛没有发生过什么事情似的。即使在那有限的睡眠的时间中，他还不停地说梦话。“材料……图纸……”更别说，放在他头边的电话机，还不时在把他从梦中唤醒，把施工中的种种问题不断地送来。后来，当各级领导干部都学会了管理生产，当技术人员在实际锻炼中学会了一套本领，工人们会熟练地运用他们手中的工具，混乱的情况结束了，工地里的一切都井井有条，而工作效率比过去提高了好几倍。这时，当人们谈到他在施工初期那种奋不顾身的情景时，他总是付之一笑，仿佛表示：他经过的一切都是平常的微不足道的。
    我永远不能忘记：1956年6月，雨季提前来了，秦岭和大巴山的千沟万壑中，暴涨的洪水在翻腾。交通断绝了，电话全断了，被洪水包围的工人们陷于孤立无援的境地。和我住一个工棚的几位老工程师，像久经锻炼的老战士似的，镇静而勇敢地应付这突然降临的灾祸。他们在有牺牲可能的地点，沉着地顶着大雨，指挥工人们工作。他们一个通夜又一个通夜，一个星期又一个星期，和工人们并肩与洪水战斗。没有粮食，饿着肚子，也毫无怨言地继续工作。
    与此同时，在我们住的工棚对面的工地里，有数千名工人，也被洪水包围住了。夜以继日，大雨浇着他们。没有饭吃，而身边的大山还时常崩塌，发出惊天动地的吼声。但是他们依然不息地工作着。爆炸山崖的火光与闪电光辉映，开山的炮声与雷声交鸣。
    我永远不能忘记工地里成千上万的茅草棚。这些茅草棚里，住着工人们的妻子和儿女。某一个茅草棚里，当开始修路时，那工人的小儿子还在襁褓之中，一年又一年，这孩子可以跟上妈妈到工地去送饭。或者，在大雨瓢泼的夜里，这孩子，站在茅草棚门口，趁着闪电，从对面的绝壁上站着的无数开凿山岭的人影中，辨认他的爸爸。有的工人被洪水吞没，或者因山崩而突然离开人世。他的妻子，便背上孩子，接住丈夫遗留下的修路工具，继续向高山大江进行斗争。这时，你如果看看这劳动妇女勤奋的工作和刚毅的面孔，你就会知道她怎样把无限的悲痛变成澎湃的思想和不竭的力量，你就会看到我们事业前进的动力。
    这种革命的磅礴的英雄气魄，这种为把理想变为现实的坚定的信念，并不是偶然的。我在宝成铁路工地看到第二工程局局长黄新义同志。这是个老战士，各个历史时代，敌人的子弹在他身上刻下许多伤痕。他常常和许多工人聚集在一起，望着当年工农红军写在崖壁上的标语，回忆红四方面军在大巴山斗争的情况，回味红二方面军在秦岭山区作战的情景，他和贺龙将军在这一带指挥红军战士艰苦斗争的故事。有一次在白水江车站，一群当地的老乡围在他身边。他说：“老乡！你们记得当年红军路过这里的情况吗？”老乡们说：“记得！有一个红军的长官，还在那边的土堡上讲过话！”黄新义同志说：“那个讲话的人就是我。我当时告诉你们：现在打土豪、分田地，将来要建设社会主义社会。看！现在咱们不是就忙着建设社会主义社会吗？”老乡们都感动而深思地望望黄新义同志，又望着正在修路的工人们。
    回想从前红军战士的斗争，凝视眼前这向自然界进攻的劳动大军，一部中国人民战斗的历史，就显现在你眼前。这部历史贯穿着活生生的理想，永远不移的信念和无敌的力量，而这一切又都渗透在这修筑铁路的人们的每滴血和每个细胞中。
    宝成铁路，这是千千万万的劳动人民，用四五年时间创造的永远不朽的诗篇。这诗篇写着工人阶级的永远不朽的功勋。凡是乘坐火车通过这条铁路的人，不论你是到远方工作，去学习，或者去探望亲人，你目睹了这伟大的工程，就都不能不感激为建设我们祖国而奋勇劳动的人们。
