The historic Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is able to convene in Cairo. On behalf of the Chinese delegation and the Chinese people, I would like to express our highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to our host, the Egyptian government and the Egyptian people, and extend fraternal greetings to the delegations of all countries participating in the conference and the people they represent.

The Cairo Conference is a development of the Bandung Conference of April 1955. Government representatives from twenty-nine Asian and African countries participated in the Bandung Conference. They reached various agreements on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, produced the Bandung Spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and promoted the unity of Asian and African countries.

Our conference this time is another non-governmental conference after the Asian Countries Conference, but the scope of the conference has been greatly expanded. We have representatives from nearly fifty countries participating, and we can more freely express the wishes and demands of our people and work together to achieve them. We want to further promote the unity of Asian and African countries and, through our unity, unite peace-loving people all over the world.

The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have become common standards for all countries in the world today. The resolution of the 12th UN General Assembly on December 14 basically affirmed these five principles. These five principles are also the basic principles of our conference. What we want to strive for is the gradual realization of these five principles. We call on all countries to respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, and adopt policies of equality and mutual benefit in human rights and economic affairs, in order to achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems.

To respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, to not invade each other, and to not interfere in internal affairs, for our Asian and African countries, we must strive for national independence and oppose imperialism and colonialism. Under the aggression of colonialism and imperialism, in the past few hundred years, our Asian and African countries have gradually lost their independence and have fallen into colonies or semi-colonies sooner or later. We have long been subjected to the most unequal treatment, racial discrimination, economic aggression and cultural aggression, and subjected to enslavement and exploitation, resulting in poverty and backwardness, and losing a peaceful and happy life. Therefore, in our Asian and African countries, striving for national independence and opposing imperialism and colonialism are inseparable from the movement to defend peace. We must have independence and equality, and then we can have peace.

We are very pleased that in the last ten years, almost all Asian countries have gained independence, and many African countries have also gained independence. The movement for independence in various countries is rising. We sincerely hope that all countries in the world will gain full independence in the shortest possible time. It is a glorious thing for us to get rid of the shackles of colonialism. It is also a glorious thing for colonialists to lose the title of imperialism. When there is no imperialism and colonialism, no colonies and semi-colonies in the world, a bright situation of lasting peace can emerge. This is the common goal we Asian and African countries are striving for, and it is also the goal that the development of the entire human race is pointing towards.

Human beings are constantly progressing, and at present, they have progressed to the era of becoming masters of the stars. Just as we are gathered here to work for the cause of peace, the two man-made earth satellites launched by the Soviet Union are rotating over our heads day and night. They are telling us day and night: Stand higher, look farther, give full play to our ideals to the highest degree, and seek comprehensive welfare for the present and future of all mankind!

Those warmongers who are essentially strengthening and expanding the preparations for nuclear weapons wars intentionally unite the North Atlantic Treaty, the Baghdad Treaty and the Manila Treaty countries, attempting to make the entire Eastern Hemisphere a battlefield for nuclear weapons wars. This is the most vicious conspiracy. The people of our Asian and African continents, in particular, cannot tolerate it.

Dr. Anup Singh of India gave a satisfactory political report at the conference. I agree with all his statements, but there is only one small point that I disagree with. He said: It is the brains of the Eisenhowerists that need to be filled with a vacuum. But I believe that their brains are not a vacuum, but are filled with bad ideas such as selfishness, obtaining bloody super profits, and a sense of racial superiority. Therefore, I hope that Mr. Dulles and his friends can truly become a vacuum in their brains.

We know that the American people, like the people of all countries in the world, love peace, and the American people are our good friends. President Eisenhower won the majority of votes in the two presidential campaigns by issuing peace checks in advance. Therefore, in today's movement to strive for lasting world peace, we believe that the peace-loving American people should bear the greatest responsibility.

In today's world where intercontinental missiles have been invented, it is an extremely stupid idea to turn the Eastern Hemisphere into a nuclear weapons battlefield and let the Western Hemisphere be at ease. Today, if a "push-button war" is triggered, no corner of the earth can escape serious disaster, especially countries like the United States that often threaten human security with nuclear weapons. Today should be the era of "drawing firewood from under the cauldron." The "cold war" policy, the "brink of war" policy, and the atomic war preparation policy of Mr. Dulles and others are precisely using oil to put out a fire. I want to say it again: That is the most stupid thing. We especially hope that the wise American people should quickly find a way to stop the execution of those stupid policies.

What's wrong with mankind being able to coexist peacefully? After all, the thousands of years of human history have been more about peaceful coexistence than mutual killings. The era of peaceful coexistence is the era when the material and cultural life of human beings is improved. Every time after a mutual killing, human culture is devastated, and the development of human culture has taken many detours as a result. Historical experience teaches us: What did the warmongers ultimately get from the war? Not to mention the distant past, please ask, what were the results of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki? The wounds of the Second World War launched by them have not yet been completely healed in many countries, especially in their own countries. Human beings should not be so forgetful.

We Chinese have an old saying called "greed makes one lose his mind." All selfish people are always very forgetful. We hope that this selfish idea can be thoroughly changed. Ancient philosophers were calling on us thousands of years ago: to treat all mankind as brothers, not to impose on others what we don't like, to encourage ourselves, and to help others. These ideas have a very long history, but in today's new era, they are still new ideas. However, in today's new era, these ideas are even more likely to be realized.

In our view, the people of our Asian and African countries are tolerant and optimistic people. We all love peace and hate war from the bottom of our hearts. However, we are not afraid of war either. In order to strive for national independence, to resist imperialism, and to protect the security of our motherland and the progress of mankind, we can sacrifice our lives. Under the disaster of colonialism, we can endure for a hundred years, or even hundreds of years, but we will eventually drive away the colonialists.

Here, we want to congratulate the heroic Egyptian people. Under the leadership of President Nasser, the Egyptian people have won the victory of the revolution and repelled the joint imperialist offensive last year.

Here, we want to congratulate the people of Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana, Malaya and other countries that have recently gained independence. I want to repeat: We sincerely hope that all countries will gain full independence in the shortest possible time.

The current era is an era of complete awakening of all Asian and African nations. To complete our lofty task of striving for independence, freedom, equality and peace, we must strengthen our unity in the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences. Unity is strength. What the imperialists are most unhappy about is our unity. Their consistent strategy is to divide us in order to defeat us individually. We don't do what the imperialists are happy about; we speed up what the imperialists are unhappy about. This can be used as an indicator of our actions.

We Chinese people have won the victory of the revolution based on such an action indicator. We united the strength of 600 million people and drove away the imperialists. We want to further unite the strength of 600 million people to build our motherland. We are prepared to catch up with the level of the United Kingdom within fifteen years. This is not simply our subjective wish. Please look at the Soviet Union. This year is the 40th anniversary of the Soviet Union since the October Revolution. For nearly half of the forty years, it has spent in war, however, after only twenty years of construction, the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in many aspects. This is our glorious example. We must learn from the Soviet Union in building our motherland.

To build the motherland, there must be a peaceful environment, therefore, the cause of defending peace and the cause of national construction are inseparable from us. Defending world peace and promoting human happiness are clearly stipulated in our constitution and are the responsibility of every Chinese citizen.

Our Chinese delegation came to participate in this conference with the Bandung spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences. Our policy is unity, unity, and the third is still unity. We are not prepared to put forward any suggestions related to our national interests, because we know that friends will put forward any suggestions that are beneficial to China for us. But here, I want to declare to my friends: At present, there is a conspiracy to create "two Chinas" internationally, and the Chinese people are resolutely opposed to it. There is no doubt that Taiwan is Chinese territory. In order to maintain the integrity of the territory, Taiwan must be liberated. At the same time, we firmly support the just struggle of any country for independence, equality, and resistance to imperialism and colonialism. Because the struggle of our friends is our struggle, and the victory of our friends is our victory. We have a common destiny, a common task, and a common goal. We must strive for common victory.

We firmly support all concrete proposals that are conducive to easing international tensions, defending world peace, and promoting human happiness. For example, the seven proposals put forward by the Soviet government, which we believe are in line with the deep aspirations of the people of the world, and we hope that they can be realized as soon as possible.

We have listened to many reports and speeches at the meeting, and we fully support many good suggestions. Due to time constraints, I am not prepared to list them. We firmly believe that in various group meetings and at the general assembly, representatives from all countries will be able to give full play to our collective wisdom and make wise choices that we can all agree on based on the Bandung spirit. Our choices will not only be conducive to the development of our Asian and African countries, but will also be conducive to human progress.

Light comes from the East. Our Asian and African countries are generally called Eastern countries, and our ancestors brought brilliant light to human culture.

In modern times, after a long night, we were in a dark period, but now the East has dawned again.

Let us unite, work together, help each other, be worthy of our ancestors, bring more brilliant light to human culture, and let the sun rise forever!

Long live the heroic Egyptian people!

Long live the solidarity of the Asian and African people!

Long live world peace! (Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 31, 1957)

    朋友们的斗争就是我们的斗争
    郭沫若1957年12月31日在亚非人民团结大会上的发言
    历史性的亚非人民团结大会能够在开罗召开，我代表中国代表团和中国人民首先对于我们的东道主——埃及政府和埃及人民表示崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢，对参加会议的各国代表团和他们所代表的各国人民致兄弟的敬礼。
    开罗会议是1955年4月万隆会议的发展。万隆会议有二十九个亚非国家的政府代表参加，在和平共处五项原则的基础之上达成了各项协议，产生了求同存异的万隆精神，促进了亚非各国的团结。
    我们这一次的会议是亚洲国家会议之后的又一次民间性的会议，但会议的范围是远远扩大了。我们有接近五十个国家的代表参加，我们可以更自由地表达我们各国人民的愿望和要求，并共同努力求其实现。我们要进一步促进亚非各国的团结，并通过我们的团结来团结全世界爱好和平的人民。
    和平共处五项原则在今天已经成为世界各国共同的准则了。最近12月14日第十二届联合国大会会议的决议基本上肯定了这五项原则。这五项原则同样也就是我们这次会议的基本原则，我们所要争取的就是这五项原则的逐步实现。我们要求世界各国相互尊重主权和领土完整，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，在人权和经济方面采取平等互利的政策，以达到不同制度的国家和平共处。
    要相互尊重主权和领土完整，要互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，在我们亚非国家来说，就必须争取民族独立，反对帝国主义和殖民主义。在殖民主义和帝国主义侵略之下，近几百年来，我们亚非国家逐步失掉了自己的独立，或先或后地沦陷为殖民地或者半殖民地。我们长期受到最不平等的待遇，受到种族歧视、经济侵略和文化侵略，受到奴役剥削，招致了贫困落后，失掉了和平幸福的生活。因而，在我们亚非国家，争取民族独立并反对帝国主义和殖民主义是和保卫和平运动分不开的。要有独立平等，我们然后才有和平。
    我们非常欣幸，在最近十年内，亚洲国家差不多全部获得了独立，非洲国家中也有许多获得了独立，各国争取独立的运动正在风起云涌。我们深切希望，在今后最短时期内，世界上所有的国家都全部获得独立。我们失掉了殖民主义的枷锁是光荣的事。殖民主义者失掉了帝国主义的头衔，同样也是光荣的事。世界上没有了帝国主义和殖民主义，没有了殖民地和半殖民地，在那时，就可以出现持久和平的光辉的局面。这是我们亚非各国所共同争取的目标，也是整个人类的发展所指向的目标。
    人类是在不断进步的，在目前，已经进步到成为星际主人的时代了。正当我们聚集在这儿为和平事业而努力的时候，苏联发射出的两个人造地球卫星日日夜夜在我们的头上旋转，它们日日夜夜在告诉我们：站得高些，望得远些，把我们的理想发挥到最高度，为全人类的现在和将来谋求全面的福利吧！
    那些在实质上是把核武器战争的准备更加加强和扩大了的好战分子们，有意把北大西洋公约、巴格达条约和马尼拉条约国家联成一体，企图使整个东半球成为核武器战争的战场。这是最恶毒的阴谋。在我们亚非两洲，人民特别是不能容许的。
    印度的阿努普·辛格博士在大会上作了一个可以令人满意的政治报告。我同意他的各种说法，只有一点小地方我不大同意。他说：艾森豪威尔主义者的脑筋才是需要填补的真空。我却认为，他们的脑筋不是真空，而是被自私自利、获得血腥的超额利润、种族优越感这些坏思想所填满了。所以，我倒希望杜勒斯先生和他的朋友们，他们的脑筋能够真正成为真空。
    我们知道美国人民和全世界各国人民一样，是爱好和平的，美国人民是我们的好朋友。艾森豪威尔总统在两次总统竞选中，都是以预发和平支票而获得多数的选票的。因此，在今天争取世界持久和平的运动中，我们认为，爱好和平的美国人民所负的责任应该最大。
    在洲际导弹已经发明了的今天，要把东半球化为核武器战场，让西半球逍遥物外，那是一种极愚蠢的想法。在今天，如果“按钮战争”触发，地球上任何一个角落都逃不脱严重的灾难，特别是像美国那样经常以核武器来威胁人类安全的国家。在今天应该是“釜底抽薪”的时代了。杜勒斯先生们的“冷战”政策、“战争边缘”政策、准备原子战争政策，正是用石油来救火。我要再说一遍：那是再愚蠢也没有的。我们特别希望，富有智慧的美国人民，应该赶快设法停止那些愚蠢的政策的执行。
    人类能够和平共处到底有什么不好呢？人类几千年的历史毕竟是和平共处的时代多，相互砍杀的时代少。和平共处的时代，便是人类的物质生活和文化生活提高的时代。每经过一次相互砍杀，人类文化便遭受到摧残，人类文化的发展因而走了不少的弯路。历史的经验教训了我们：好战者从战争中究竟得到了什么呢？远的且不说，请问，希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机，他们的结果是怎样了？由他们所发动的第二次世界大战的创伤，直到现在在好些国家中，特别是在他们自己的祖国中，还没有完全医疗好。人类是不应该那么健忘的。
    我们中国有句古话叫作“利令智昏”，凡是自私自利的人，总是十分健忘的人。我们希望，这种自私自利的思想能够加以彻底改变。古代的哲人在几千年前就在向我们号召：要我们把全人类当成兄弟，要我们不要把自己所不喜欢的东西强加于人，要我们勉励自己，也要帮助别人。这些思想，已经有了很长远的历史，在今天的新时代，却仍不失为新的思想。然而，在今天的新时代，这些思想也更有实现的可能了。
    我们亚非各国的人民，在我们看来，都是富于容忍性的、乐天主义的人民。我们都从心里爱好和平，憎恨战争。然而，我们也并不害怕战争。为了争取民族独立，为了反抗帝国主义，为了保护祖国的安全和人类的进步，我们能够不惜牺牲自己的生命。我们在殖民主义的灾难之下，可以忍受一百年，甚至几百年，但终于会把殖民主义者赶走。
    在这里，我们要向英雄的埃及人民致贺。埃及人民在纳赛尔总统的领导之下，获得了革命的胜利，并在去年打退了帝国主义的联合进攻。
    在这里，我们要向新近获得独立的苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯、加纳、马来亚等国的人民致贺。我要重复一遍：我们深切希望在今后最短时期内，所有的国家都全部获得独立。
    目前是亚非各民族整个觉醒的时代，我们要完成我们争取独立、自由、平等、和平的崇高任务，就必须以求同存异的精神，加强我们的团结。团结就是力量。帝国主义者所最不高兴的，就是我们的团结一致。他们的一贯的策略，就是分散我们，以便个别击破。帝国主义者所高兴的事，我们不做；帝国主义者所不高兴的事，我们加紧做。这可以作为我们的行动的一个指标。
    我们中国人民就是依据这样的行动指标而获得革命的胜利的。我们团结了六亿人民的力量，赶走了帝国主义者。我们要更进一步团结六亿人民的力量，建设自己的祖国。我们准备在十五年之内赶上英国的水平。这不单纯是我们的主观愿望，我们请看苏联吧。苏联自十月革命以来，今年是四十周年了。四十年中，几乎有一半的年月是在战争中渡过的，然而，仅仅二十来年的建设，苏联在很多的方面已经超过了美国。这是我们的光辉的榜样。我们在建设祖国方面，就是要向苏联看齐。
    要建设祖国，就必须有和平的环境，因而保卫和平事业和建国事业，在我们是分不开来的。保卫世界和平和促进人类幸福，在我们的宪法中有明文的规定，是我们每一个中国公民的责任。
    我们中国代表团来参加这次会议，就是怀抱着求同存异的万隆精神来的。我们的方针也就是团结，团结，第三个还是团结。我们不准备提出有关本国利益的任何建议，因为我们知道：凡是有利于中国的建议，朋友们都会替我们提出的。但我在这里，要向朋友们声明：目前在国际上有制造“两个中国”的阴谋，中国人民是坚决反对的。毫无疑问，台湾是中国的领土，为了保持领土的完整，必须解放台湾。同时，我们坚决支持任何国家的有关争取独立、平等和反抗帝国主义、殖民主义的正义的斗争。因为朋友们的斗争，也就是我们的斗争，朋友们的胜利，也就是我们的胜利。我们有共同的命运，共同的任务，共同的目标。我们必须争取共同的胜利。
    我们坚决支持有利于缓和国际紧张局势、保卫世界和平、增进人类幸福的一切具体建议，例如苏联政府所提出的七项建议，我们认为是符合世界人民的深切愿望的，我们希望能够尽速地得到实现。
    我们在会议上已经听取了不少的报告和发言，很多好的建议我们是完全支持的，因为时间关系，我不准备列举了。我们坚决相信，在各种小组会议上和大会上，各国代表一定都能够发挥我们的集体智慧，根据万隆精神，作出我们大家都能够同意的明智的抉择。我们的抉择，将不仅有利于我们亚非各国的发展，并将有利于全人类的进步。
    光明自东方来。我们亚非国家一般都被称为东方国家，我们的祖先曾为人类文化带来过灿烂的光明。
    近代以来，经过了一个漫漫的长夜，我们处在黑暗时期，但现在的东方又已经天亮了。
    让我们团结一致，共同努力，相互协助，无愧于我们祖先，为人类文化带来更灿烂的光明，让太阳永远上升吧！
    英勇的埃及人民万岁！
    亚非人民团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（新华社开罗1957年12月31日电）
