Does This Count as Rectification?
　　By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yu Xigui

    A worker from the Tianjin Radio Equipment Factory recently wrote a letter to the newspaper, describing a strange incident that occurred during the factory's rectification campaign: "Because many workers were not attending meetings, Director Liu announced at 3:00 PM on November 16, 1957, that workers should immediately shut down their machines and go to the cafeteria for a meeting. At the meeting, the director explained the importance of workers attending meetings and the necessity of workers being organized and disciplined. He then said, 'This kind of bad phenomenon must not be allowed to continue. From now on, during meetings, the workshop director will be the battalion commander, the section chief will be the platoon leader, and the team leader will be the squad leader. Each team will call the roll before the meeting, and those who are absent will be considered truant, with their wages deducted according to the meeting time. Those who agree, raise your hands!' With that, Director Liu was the first to raise his right hand. He then added, 'This is passed by everyone, so it's not considered my factory director's commandism, right!'" The worker concluded by writing, "I am very dissatisfied with this approach!"
    To understand this strange matter, this reporter visited the factory and personally witnessed the scene of workers being lined up to attend meetings.
    The origin of the matter is as follows: During the rectification, the director felt that there were many issues in production that needed improvement. So, he and the chief engineer, the head of the production planning section, and a few others sat in the office and wrote a thick "Improvement Plan for Production Technology Management," asking the workers to spend nine days discussing it in meetings. However, when the workers saw this thick plan, they all said, "We don't have such a high level of education, we can't understand it." Many teams spent an hour and a half reading it aloud in the meeting, and everyone "had no comments" and then "passed" it. The leadership felt that this approach was "not thorough enough," so they rewrote a portion of this improvement plan as big-character posters and put them up, but it similarly did not generate any response. At this point, the leadership felt that this issue could not be discussed further, but instead of deeply understanding the situation and mobilizing the masses, they adopted a method that they thought "was not commandism" to solve the problem. The strange occurrences of lining up for meetings, calling the roll, and deducting wages were among the new measures taken at this time, which the workers called the director's "masterpiece" in the rectification.
    Next, this reporter went to the factory's largest workshop, the Third Workshop, to investigate their meeting situation. In the week from December 13 to 18 last year, the workers attended the following meetings: one factory-wide staff meeting, one workshop worker meeting, three team discussion meetings, and one forum between veteran workers and young workers, for a total of six meetings. Workshop cadres had even more meetings. Take the branch secretary, for example. In that week, in addition to attending the six meetings with the workers, they also attended five meetings convened by the factory and the higher-level Party committee, for a total of eleven meetings. They spent almost half of their time living in meetings every day.
    Why are there so many meetings? How are they conducted? When workers and workshop cadres talked about this issue, they all said in unison, "The leadership is bureaucratic and aloof," "Since the rectification, the factory director and Party secretary have rarely come to our workshop to understand the situation and solicit opinions"; "They always rely on their subjective, old-fashioned ways of doing things." Workers and cadres also cited many examples to illustrate how meetings were shockingly wasting time:
    On December 4, 1957, the Party committee held an expanded meeting attended by administrative, trade union, Party, and Youth League cadres. When discussing the rectification methods, a Party committee member asked, "Why haven't the Party committee discussed the four rectification measures, such as the 'Internal Labor Rules of the Factory,' which have already been distributed to the workshops for workers to discuss?" The Party secretary exclaimed, "I didn't even know about it!" The factory director immediately declared, "I gave them all to the Party committee. I'm not responsible if the Party committee didn't discuss them..." The Youth League secretary also said he didn't know about one of the materials. But right in front of them were printed documents, which clearly had the signatures of this Youth League secretary and this Party secretary, indicating their agreement. The meeting ended in such endless arguments.
    One day in late November 1957, the Party committee instructed the workshop workers to discuss the plan for streamlining the organization, but only told the workers about the percentage of streamlining, without mentioning the number of existing cadres in each department, let alone explaining the bloated nature of the factory's organization. The workers said: How can we discuss this? We can only raise our hands in agreement.
    Can such a rectification truly eliminate the three bad styles? (Special Contribution to this newspaper)

### 这也算在整改吗？

    这也算在整改吗？
    新华社记者　虞锡珪
    天津广播器材厂的一个工人在最近写了一封信给报社，说他们工厂在整风中出了一件奇闻：“刘厂长因为许多工人不参加会议，于是在1957年11月16日下午三点，通知工人马上关机器到食堂开会。会上，厂长说明了工人参加会议的重要性，以及工人必须有组织有纪律之后，说：‘这种坏现象，决不容许再继续下去。今后开会时，车间主任为大队长，工段长为分队长，小组长为小队长。会前各队点名报数，没有来的以旷工论，按开会的时间计算，折扣工资。大家赞成的把手举起来！’说到这里，刘厂长第一个把右手举了起来。他接着又说‘这是大家通过的，不算我厂长命令主义吧！’”这位工人在最后写道：“我对这种作法很不满意！”
    为了弄清这件怪事，记者去访问了这个工厂，一进门就亲眼看到他们让工人排队去开会的现场情况。
    事情的原由是这样的：在整改中，厂长感到生产中有许多问题需要改进，于是就和总工程师、生产计划科科长等几人坐在办公室里，写了一大本“关于生产技术管理改进方案”，让工人用九天的时间开会讨论。但是工人们一见这本厚厚的改进方案，都说：“我们没有那么高的文化水平，我们看不懂。”许多小组在会上花一个半小时念一遍，大家“没有意见”就“通过”了。领导上看到这样作，还“很不彻底”，于是又把这本改进方案中的一部分写成大字报贴出去，但同样没有引起什么反响。这时，领导上感到这个问题讨论不下去了，可是却不深入了解情况，把群众发动起来；而是采取了自以为“不算命令主义”的方法来解决问题。开会要排队、要点名、要扣工资等怪事，就是在这个时候所采取的新措施之一，工人们称这是厂长在整改中的“杰作”。
    接着，记者到这工厂比较大的车间——第三车间调查了一下他们开会的情况。在去年12月13日到18日这一周内，工人们出席的会议如下：全厂职工大会一次，车间的工人大会一次，小组讨论会三次，还有一次老工人同青年工人的座谈会，共六次。车间干部的会就更多了。就以支部书记来说吧，他们在这一周中，除了要和工人一样出席那六个会议而外，还参加了本厂和上级党委召开的会议五次，一共开了十一个会，每天几乎有一半时间是生活在会议里。
    会为什么多？都是怎样开的呢？工人和车间干部谈到这个问题的时候都异口同声地说：“领导官僚主义，高高在上”，“自从整改以来，很少见厂长、党委书记到我们车间来了解情况，征求意见”；“他们总是凭主观老一套办事”。工人们和干部们还列举了许多事例来说明会议是在怎样惊人地浪费着时间：
    1957年12月4日，党委开扩大会，行政、工会、党、团干部都参加了，在讨论到整改方法时，一个党委委员提出：“已经发到车间让工人讨论的‘本厂内部劳动规则’等四个整改措施为什么党委会没有讨论过？”党委书记惊讶地说：“我还不知道呢！”厂长立即声明：“我都交给党委会了，党委会没讨论，我不负责……。”团委书记也说不知道其中的一个材料。可是正在他们面前放着印好的文件，上面却明明有着这位团委书记和这位党委书记表示同意的签字。这个会就在这样的争论不休中结束了。
    1957年11月下旬的一天，党委会布置车间工人讨论紧缩机构的方案，可是只告诉工人关于紧缩的百分比，却没有谈各科室现有干部的人数，更没有说明本厂机构庞大的情况。工人们说：这让我们怎么讨论？只好举手同意。
    难道这样整风，能够整掉三个坏主义吗？　　（本报特约稿）
