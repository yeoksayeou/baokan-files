(Reported by this newspaper) Since December of last year, various localities have rationally adjusted the labor force in the midst of water conservancy construction, strengthened leadership over fertilizer accumulation work, and fertilizer accumulation has progressed rapidly, accelerating four to five times compared with November.

Henan Province has accumulated more than 400 billion jin of various fertilizers, reaching 70% of the original plan, exceeding the amount of fertilizer accumulated in the same period of 1956 by more than four times. Fertilizer accumulation in Gansu Province has reached 60% of the fertilizer demand, with not only a large quantity but also good quality. The famous high-yield grain areas of Chao'an, Chenghai, Jieyang, Puning, and Chaoyang in Guangdong Province are launching a winter fertilizer accumulation movement with the spirit of "thousands of boats and ten thousand loads." Fertilizer boats shuttle back and forth on the Hanjiang, Rongjiang, and ?jiang Rivers, one after another; the vast fields are full of fertilizer-carrying teams that stretch as far as the eye can see. In many places, people can still be seen accumulating fertilizer at night with lights on. Since the beginning of winter, these counties have accumulated more than 90 million dan of fertilizer, averaging 55 dan of fertilizer per mu of paddy field. Jiangsu Province, due to the timely criticism of conservative thinking and the promotion of advanced regions and advanced units to continue to move forward, the fertilizer accumulation movement has been carried out persistently and deeply. At present, the number of people participating in fertilizer accumulation every day reaches 6.2 million, and the accumulated fertilizer has reached 4.2 billion dan. Shaanxi Province has made great strides in the fertilizer accumulation movement after correcting the practice of emphasizing water conservancy over fertilizer accumulation. By the end of December, the province's fertilizer accumulation had reached 76.9% of the original plan. In addition, the fertilizer accumulation movements in Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia have also achieved remarkable results.

The current fertilizer accumulation movement has brought about great changes in customs and habits in many regions. For a long time, many areas in Anhui lacked toilets for people and pens for pigs and sheep, resulting in a large loss of fertilizer. However, now the more than 90,000 fertilizer accumulation construction teams established in the province have built more than 3 million toilets and pig and sheep pens for agricultural cooperatives and members; members have added more than 1.1 million pieces of fertilizer accumulation tools such as large and small jars, urine buckets, and manure baskets. In Jilin Province, a new atmosphere of "scattered manure forming piles, wild manure returning home" has also emerged. According to recent statistics, the newly built toilets in many agricultural cooperatives account for 24% of all toilets in the province; there are already 700,000 pig pens, with an average of one pig pen for every two and a half pigs, of which the newly built ones account for 17%. Hunan Province promotes the advanced experience of "four diligences and eight haves" in Liling County, adheres to the year-round fertilizer accumulation movement, and the habit of letting cattle and pigs roam freely is gradually changing. Changwei Prefecture in Shandong Province is promoting "three changes" - changing the absence of pens for raising pigs; changing the connected thatched huts and implementing separation of pens and toilets; and changing the application of dry manure to the application of wet manure. According to statistics from Zhucheng, Gaomi, and Weixian, more than 60,000 pens and toilets have been renovated and built; the use of wet manure has become more common in the application of topdressing fertilizer to wheat in various places. Many areas in Hubei Province have also launched "five haves" campaigns, such as "pigs have pens, cattle have barns, people have toilets, manure has cellars, and chickens have cages."

The personal involvement of leading comrades and the active leadership of grassroots cadres are a major feature of this fertilizer accumulation movement. County Party secretaries and county heads in Gaoling, Luochuan, and Nanzheng counties in Shaanxi Province personally dug out latrines and carried baskets to collect manure. A large number of county and township cadres in Longguan County, Hebei, together with the peasants, carried manure baskets and actively engaged in fertilizer accumulation. In order to ensure that cadres regularly persist in fertilizer accumulation work, Gaoshazi Township in this county has also established fertilizer accumulation stations for county and township cadres in nine agricultural cooperatives.

Many regions have conscientiously implemented mutually beneficial policies in the fertilizer accumulation movement. Pingliang Prefecture in Gansu Province, while launching the fertilizer accumulation movement, cleared up the fertilizer accumulation accounts for the past five or six years, rationally adjusted the fertilizer accumulation work points and fertilizer prices, and the efficiency of fertilizer accumulation increased by an average of three to four times. In the past, Xinfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Yilan County, Heilongjiang, relied solely on collective fertilizer accumulation. By the end of 1957, the cooperative had accumulated only enough manure for 300 hectares of land, accounting for one-third of the cooperative's land area; recently, after determining reasonable remuneration for fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer accumulation workers can be seen everywhere, and it is estimated that all 900 hectares of land in the cooperative will be fertilized before spring plowing.

    合理安排劳力，既抓水利，也抓积肥
    积肥运动大踏步前进
    本报讯　自去年12月以来，各地在兴修水利中合理调整了劳动力，加强对积肥工作的领导，积肥进展很快，同11月份比较，加快了四、五倍。
    河南省已积各种肥料四千多亿斤，达原计划的70％，超过1956年同期积肥数量四倍以上。甘肃省积肥已达到需肥量的60％，不仅数量多，而且质量好。著名的高产粮区广东的潮安、澄海、揭阳、普宁、潮阳等五个千斤县，正以“千船万载”的气魄开展冬季积肥运动。韩江、榕江、?江上积肥船只来往如梭，首尾相接；广大的田野上到处都是一眼望不到尽头的挑肥队伍。许多地方夜间还可以看见点灯积肥的人群。入冬以来，这几个县已积肥九千多万担，平均每亩水田有肥五十五担。江苏省由于及时批判了保守思想，推动先进地区、先进单位继续前进，积肥运动开展得持久而深入，目前每天参加积肥的人数达六百二十万人，积肥已达四十二亿担。陕西省纠正了重水利轻积肥的做法以后，积肥运动大踏步前进。到12月底，全省积肥已达到原订计划的76.9％。此外，山东、河北、山西、内蒙古等地的积肥运动也取得了显著的成绩。
    当前的积肥运动已经使得许多地区在风俗习惯上发生了大变化。安徽许多地区长期以来人无厕所，猪羊无圈，肥料大量散失。但是，现在全省成立的九万多个积肥基建队，已为农业社和社员修厕所、猪羊圈共三百多万个；社员添置大小缸罐、尿桶、粪筐等积肥工具一百一十多万个。吉林省也出现了“散粪成堆，野粪还家”的新气象，许多农业社新修的厕所，据最近统计已占全省所有厕所的24％；猪圈已有七十万个，平均两头半猪就有一个猪圈，其中新修的占17％。湖南省推广醴陵县的“四勤八有”先进经验，坚持常年性的积肥运动，放野牛、跑猪的习惯正在逐步改变。山东省昌潍专区正在推行“三改”——改变养猪无圈；改变连茅圈，实行圈、厕分离；把施干粪改变为施湿粪。据诸城、高密、潍县统计，已改造和修建栏圈厕所六万多个；各地在施小麦追肥中，用湿粪的普遍增多。湖北省很多地区还开展了“猪有圈、牛有栏、人有厕所、粪有窖、鸡有笼”等“五有”运动。
    领导同志亲自动手，基层干部积极带头是这次积肥运动的一大特点。陕西省高陵、洛川、南郑等县的县委书记和县长，都亲自动手掏挖茅坑，提筐拾粪。河北龙关县大批县、乡干部，与农民一起背上了粪筐，积极地投入积肥。为了使干部经常坚持积肥工作，这个县的高栅子乡在九个农业社里还建立了县乡干部积肥站。
    许多地区在积肥运动中认真贯彻了互利政策。甘肃平凉专区在展开积肥运动的同时，清理了五、六年的积肥账目，合理调整了积肥工分和肥料价格，积肥效率平均提高了三、四倍。黑龙江依兰县新丰农业社过去只靠集体积肥，到1957年年底全社所积的粪肥仅能上三百公顷地，占全社土地面积三分之一；最近确定了积肥的合理报酬以后，到处都可以看到积肥的人群，预计到春耕前全社九百多公顷地，全部都可以施上肥。（附图片）
