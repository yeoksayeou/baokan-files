Refuting the Bourgeoisie's Fallacies on Freedom
    Chi Liaozhou

In the early stages of the rectification campaign, bourgeois rightists openly demanded so-called "political freedom," "freedom of the press," "freedom of publication," "freedom of literature and art," "freedom of science," and various other freedoms from the Communist Party and the People's Government. This means that the bourgeois rightists were using the banner of bourgeois freedom to launch a frenzied attack on the Communist Party and socialism, and they placed their dreams of restoration primarily on restoring bourgeois freedom. Therefore, we cannot help but think that the bourgeoisie around the world are experiencing the final act of their historical tragedy.

The tragedy of the bourgeoisie originally began as a comedy. As everyone knows, when the bourgeoisie stepped onto the stage of history, they held high banners of freedom and the like to overthrow the feudal slavery system. It not only helped the bourgeoisie seize political power from the feudal aristocracy, but also helped capitalism open up a fully developed world free market. The bourgeoisie also used liberal ideas to establish a complete ideological system of their own to cover up the ugly essence of the capitalist exploitation system.

However, we also know that even during the bourgeois democratic revolution, when the peasant revolution arose, the bourgeoisie silenced the gongs and drums of "natural human rights (freedom and equality)." Because if they didn't, the peasants would turn around and demand human rights and freedom from the bourgeoisie, which would endanger the bourgeoisie's rule. And when capitalism developed to the stage of monopoly capitalism, the monopoly capitalists simply opposed talking about individual freedom and wanted everyone to obey the interests of their small group of monopoly capitalists. As Stalin pointed out in his speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "Formerly, the bourgeoisie sang the praises of liberalism and defended the freedom of bourgeois democracy, thereby building up prestige for themselves among the people. Now, not even a shadow of liberalism remains. ...The banner of bourgeois democratic freedom has been thrown aside."

This is one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, we can see that when things develop to the point where the proletariat rises up to overthrow the capitalist system, and the bourgeoisie has been overthrown or is about to be eliminated, the bourgeoisie picks up this "freedom" banner that has been thrown aside to oppose the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. After the world began to be divided into two camps, socialist and capitalist, the imperialists immediately touted the capitalist world as the "free world" and used the excuse of unfreedom to carry out shameless subversive activities against socialist countries. In the face of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the bourgeoisie always makes all kinds of cries about freedom, especially taking advantage of the anarchistic tendencies of the petty bourgeoisie, talking about this freedom and that freedom, inciting them to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat together. This is because the bourgeoisie regards freedom as a talisman. They once used the slogan of freedom to fight for their own survival and development from the feudal aristocracy, and now, in order to restore what they have lost or are about to lose from the proletariat, they are creating various fallacies on the issue of freedom. All these fallacies about freedom have become the main content of international imperialism's opposition to the communist movement and the socialist camp. Therefore, bourgeois liberalism has now become a trend of thought for bourgeois restoration. This precisely shows that the bourgeoisie is making a dying struggle.

Even so, the question of freedom remains a focal point of the current struggle between the bourgeoisie and our proletariat; in particular, the anarchistic tendencies of the petty bourgeoisie can easily be combined with this restorationist thinking of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, a correct understanding of the question of freedom is still of great significance today.

So, what is freedom?

In his book "Fundamental Problems of Marxism," Plekhanov mentioned a sentence that Hegel said in "Philosophy of Religion": Freedom is not wanting anything other than oneself. Plekhanov believed that this sentence touched on social psychology and gave a brilliant explanation of the entire issue of freedom. Plekhanov further gave an example: "The peasants demanded that the landlords' land be given to them; they 'did not want anything other than themselves.' And the Constitutional Democrats landlords who promised to give the land to the peasants wanted something that was 'not themselves,' but something that history forced them to want. The first (referring to the peasants wanting the landlords to hand over the land) is freedom; the second (referring to the landlords handing over the land) is rational obedience to necessity." Similarly, we can say that the proletariat turning the bourgeoisie's means of production into social property is freedom for the proletariat, and for the capitalists, it is a historical necessity; it is impossible not to do so.

That is to say, there is no such thing as complete freedom for everyone and everything in the world. At the same time, we must know that freedom and necessity alternate; the bourgeoisie overthrowing feudalism is freedom for the bourgeoisie, but when the bourgeoisie faces the proletariat, it must obey necessity, that is, socialize the bourgeoisie's means of production, allowing the proletariat to gain freedom, which is actually allowing social productive forces to develop more freely. Therefore, in bourgeois society, in order to get rid of this fate of obeying historical necessity, the bourgeoisie, through its politicians and theorists, vigorously touts the so-called "national freedom" of capitalist countries, attempting to use this argument and various so-called forms of national freedom to paralyze the proletariat and prevent the proletariat from seeing the true face of the bourgeoisie.

When the bourgeois rightists openly promoted bourgeois freedom, they put forward a reason to defend it, saying: "You say that there is no freedom for the proletariat in capitalist countries, but they have Hyde Park, with the Communist Party and the Communist Party's newspapers existing." This is the fact. However, these gentlemen seem not to understand: first, the extent to which the bourgeoisie realizes freedom outside of itself depends on the security of the bourgeoisie itself. Only when the bourgeoisie believes that this freedom does not greatly hinder its fundamental interests can it grant this freedom. Has Hyde Park—this "free world" under the "protection" of the police—had any important impact on British politics? No. Did it prevent Eden from launching the dirty war of aggression against Egypt? Did it persuade Macmillan to prohibit American planes carrying hydrogen bombs from flying over the British Isles? None of them could. Since this is the case, and retaining this form of freedom can also become an embellishment to tout bourgeois freedom, why wouldn't the British bourgeoisie be happy to do so? It should be said that behind this form of freedom is actually a kind of hidden bourgeois dictatorship. Second, the extent to which the freedom in the constitution of bourgeois countries can be realized also depends on the comparison of forces between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the world and in its own country. The existence of the Communist Parties and their newspapers in countries such as France, Italy, and the United States is not a gift from the bourgeoisie, but the result of the proletariat's struggle. The fact that the Communist Parties and their newspapers in capitalist countries are often persecuted and restricted is enough to show that their existence is not a generous gift from the bourgeoisie.

The bourgeoisie has always liked to play with the words of so-called general and national freedom in order to cover up the essence of the bourgeois dictatorship. However, we openly declare that what we are practicing is socialist democratic freedom, that is, guaranteeing the freedom of the majority and restricting the freedom of the minority. The bourgeois rightists once said that during the Kuomintang rule, their freedom was only a matter of degree, but in socialist society, for them, freedom is a matter of having or not having it. On the one hand, this argument distorts the reality of our country's current political life, because in our country, the bourgeoisie still has the freedom stipulated in the constitution today, and even for some bourgeois rightists, they have not yet been completely deprived of all their political rights today. On the other hand, this argument also reflects a historical fact, that is, in carrying out the socialist revolution, we have indeed deprived the bourgeoisie of the freedom to develop capitalism and establish a bourgeois dictatorship in China, and we must thoroughly eliminate the bourgeoisie and all its freedoms. Because this is a question of the bourgeoisie's ultimate fate, the bourgeois rightists always try to compete with the proletariat, so after the Chinese Communist Party announced the rectification movement, they believed that the time for the restoration of capitalism had come, so they launched attacks from all sides, attempting to realize bourgeois freedom. However, facts have proved that this hope of capitalist restoration has no possibility of being realized in China.

We cannot fail to see that this restorationist thinking of the bourgeoisie has a broad social and ideological basis, which is the anarchistic tendency of the petty bourgeoisie. We know that anarchism is mainly an ideology of the petty bourgeoisie and the lumpenproletariat, who, due to their economic status, regard all state power and organizational discipline as shackles of freedom. The bourgeoisie, especially when they are in power, also oppose extreme anarchism, but anarchism can also become their weapon against the proletariat and socialism. Therefore, contemporary anarchist thought is beneficial to bourgeois restoration and harmful to the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialist construction. Of course, people with anarchistic tendencies are not necessarily all rightists, but if this view is not strictly criticized and allowed to develop, the result will inevitably be to degenerate into the quagmire of the rightists. In the previous period, when the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party and socialism, some people with anarchistic tendencies consciously or unconsciously followed the rightists in clamoring, serving them, and waving flags for them, which is a very obvious example. They also attempted to reconcile bourgeois freedom with proletarian freedom, and advocated mixing some capitalist system things into the socialist system in order to realize their so-called "absolute freedom." For example, they do not regard "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" as a slogan of struggle, believing that poisonous weeds do not need to be weeded out, advocating that the bourgeoisie and the proletariat share equally in the academic field and do not interfere with each other, they believe that literary and artistic creation should not put forward the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, the news media should be independent and autonomous, and scientific research needs to be carried out in a decentralized and spontaneous manner. Obviously, they yearn for a kind of "absolute freedom" that is free from the leadership of the Party and socialist planning. This advocacy of freedom for the sake of freedom is obviously a wrong view. Comrade Mao Zedong said that our freedom is freedom with leadership, not anarchy, and anarchy does not conform to the interests and wishes of the people.

At the same time, we know that there is no such thing as "absolute freedom" anywhere in the world and at any time. Plekhanov, in his popular explanation of Hegel's argument that "freedom is the recognition of necessity," has fully explained that absolute freedom is impossible, freedom is conditional, and it has an element of obedience. He said: "The focus of all questions lies in how exactly the word necessity is to be explained? Aristotle once said that the concept of necessity has various different meanings: to be healthy, it is necessary to take medicine; to live, it is necessary to breathe; to borrow money, it is necessary to go to the miser." This is the so-called conditional necessity. "If he wants to get a harvest, he must sow; if he wants to kill a beast, he must shoot an arrow; if he wants to drive a steam engine, he must accumulate fuel, and so on. ...This obedience of man to nature is the condition for man to be liberated. Man obeys nature, and thus also increases man's power to dominate nature, that is, increases his freedom. The same is true under a planned social production organization. People, in obeying certain technical and economic necessary requirements, may end the blind system in which people are ruled by their own products, that is, people may greatly increase their freedom. Here, their obedience may become the source of their liberation."

People with anarchistic views are precisely unable to correctly understand this relationship between freedom and necessity, therefore, they often oppose freedom to the socialist line, plan, and party spirit principles, as if the Party's leadership and the socialist line and plan are all things that hinder freedom. They do not understand: first, the socialist line and the socialist plan are formulated according to the objective laws of social and natural life, which is a "necessary requirement," so obeying this line and plan will inevitably promote our various revolutionary work and construction undertakings, that is, promote the free and rapid development of social productive forces. For example, the Soviet Union's scientific research work is completely placed within the socialist plan, so that in a short period of time, it can send two red little moons into the sky, while the American scientific freedom touted by the bourgeois rightists, such as saying that in capitalist countries there can be freedom to calculate the radius of the universe, why haven't they been able to throw even a potato up to this day? Isn't this a good contrast?

Second, our emphasis on party spirit principles and the necessity of discipline and centralization is all for the purpose of ensuring the thorough realization of the socialist line and plan. Without the leadership of a strong and powerful Communist Party, all socialist lines and plans will inevitably become empty talk. And the leadership of the Communist Party is specifically manifested in the selfless dedication of its vast number of party members and the high degree of discipline and organization for the implementation of all Party resolutions. Therefore, when a Communist Party member realizes that he must completely dedicate his life to the great socialist cause, isn't that the greatest freedom? So in a certain sense, our party spirit principles are precisely the guarantee for promoting the free development of social productive forces.

It is also incorrect to regard free life as the ultimate goal of mankind. Our highest ideal is communism. In communist society, social productive forces will inevitably achieve free and great development. There is no doubt about this. This is our great goal of struggle. However, even at that time, in human life, especially in social life, people must still have discipline and organization, obey centralized management, and will never be in an anarchic state of freedom and lack of restraint. It can be said that human social life will not become more and more scattered, but more and more organized and orderly. That is to say, there is both freedom and discipline, both democracy and centralization, both unified will and personal ease of mind, liveliness and vigor.

It now seems that anarchistic views are very easy to combine with the restorationist thinking of the bourgeoisie. It is possible that some people, when yearning for absolute freedom and equality, are not subjectively aware that this will help the capitalist system to be restored in our country, but objectively, this can only be the result. Therefore, all fallacies about freedom, whether it is "national freedom" or "absolute freedom," must be resolutely exposed. As Lenin pointed out, in the era of the establishment of the bourgeois system, freedom, equality, private property, etc. were their loudest slogans; and the slogan of our socialist era should be: eliminate classes, implement the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ruthlessly expose all fallacies and prejudices about freedom and the like. Therefore, on the ideological front, our proletariat must also carry out a resolute struggle against the restorationist thinking of the bourgeoisie—all fallacies about freedom—for a long time.

    驳资产阶级关于自由的谬论
    迟蓼洲
    在整风运动的初期，资产阶级右派曾经公开地向共产党和人民政府要求所谓“政治自由”、“新闻自由”、“出版自由”、“文艺自由”、“科学自由”以及这样那样的自由。这也就是说，资产阶级右派是打着资产阶级自由的旗帜来向共产党和社会主义进行猖狂进攻的，并且把他们复辟的梦想首先寄托在恢复资产阶级的自由上面。因此，我们不禁想到，在全世界范围内，资产阶级都在经历着它们最后的一幕时代悲剧。
    资产阶级的悲剧原是从喜剧开头的。大家知道，资产阶级当它登上历史舞台的时候，是高举着自由这一类的旗帜来推翻封建奴役制度的。它不仅帮助资产阶级从封建贵族手里夺取了政治权力，而且还帮助资本主义开辟了充分发展的世界自由市场。资产阶级也用自由主义思潮来建立起了自己的一套完整的思想体系，以掩盖资本主义剥削制度的丑恶本质。
    但是，我们也知道，即使在资产阶级民主革命的过程中，当农民革命伴随而起的时候，资产阶级就偃息了“天赋人权（自由和平等）”的锣鼓。因为如果不这样，农民就会回过头来向资产阶级要求人权，要求自由，这样就会危及资产阶级的统治。而当资本主义发展到垄断资本主义的阶段，垄断资本家就干脆反对谈论什么个人自由，而要一切人都来服从他们这一小撮垄断资本家的利益。正如斯大林在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说中所指出的：“从前，资产阶级高唱自由主义，维护资产阶级民主的自由，从而在人民中间为自己树立了声望。现在，连自由主义的影子也一点没有了。……资产阶级民主的自由这面旗帜已经被抛在一边了。”
    这是事情的一方面。另一方面，我们可以看到，当事情发展到无产阶级起来推翻资本主义制度以及资产阶级已经被推翻或者即将被消灭的时候，资产阶级就又捡起这面已经被抛在一边的“自由”旗帜来反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。当世界上开始划分为社会主义和资本主义两个阵营以后，帝国主义者立刻就把资本主义世界标榜为“自由世界”，并且以不自由为借口来对社会主义国家进行无耻的颠覆活动。在无产阶级专政面前，资产阶级总要发出关于自由的种种叫嚣，特别是利用小资产阶级的无政府主义倾向，大谈这个自由那个自由，煽动他们一起来反对无产阶级专政。这是因为资产阶级是把自由作为护身符的。他们曾经以自由的口号从封建贵族那里争取到自己的生存和发展，而现在为着从无产阶级手里恢复他们已经失去或保持将要失去的东西，又在自由这个问题上制造各种各样的谬论。这种关于自由的一切谬论，已经成为国际帝国主义反对共产主义运动和社会主义阵营的主要内容。因此，资产阶级自由主义现在又成为资产阶级复辟的思潮了。这正是表明资产阶级在作着垂死前的挣扎。
    虽然如此，关于自由的问题，仍然是当前资产阶级同我们无产阶级斗争的一个焦点；特别是小资产阶级的无政府主义倾向，很容易和资产阶级这种复辟思潮结合起来。因此，正确理解自由这个问题，在今天仍具有十分重要的意义。
    那么，什么是自由呢？
    普列汉诺夫在他的“马克思主义的基本问题”一书中，曾经提到黑格尔在“宗教哲学”中说过的一句话：自由就是除了自己而外并不希望别的。普列汉诺夫认为这句话触到了社会心理，给整个的自由问题作了极灿烂的说明。普列汉诺夫还进一步举例说：“农民要求把地主的土地让给自己，他们‘除了自己而外并不希望别的’。而答应把土地让给农民的立宪民主党的地主，他们所要的已经‘不是自己’，而是历史强迫他们要的东西。第一种（引者按：指农民要地主交出土地）是自由；第二种（引者按：指地主交出土地）则是合理地服从必然。”同样地，我们可以说，无产阶级把资产阶级的生产资料变成社会所有，这对无产阶级说来是自由的，对于资本家则是历史的必然，不这样做也是不行的。
    这就是说，世界上并没有一种对什么人和对一切事情都能完全自由的东西。同时，我们要知道，自由和必然是交替着的，资产阶级推翻封建主义，对资产阶级来说是自由的，而资产阶级面对着无产阶级的时候，它就必须服从必然，也就是把资产阶级的生产资料社会化，让无产阶级获得自由，实际上也就是让社会生产力获得更加自由地发展。因此，在资产阶级社会里，资产阶级为着摆脱这种服从历史必然的命运，就通过它的政客和理论家们大肆吹嘘资本主义国家的所谓“全民自由”，企图用这种论调和各种所谓全民自由的形式来麻痹无产阶级，使无产阶级看不清资产阶级真实面目。
    资产阶级右派在公开地宣扬资产阶级自由的时候，提出一个为之辩护的理由，他们说：“你们说资本主义国家没有无产阶级的自由，可是人家有海德公园，有共产党和共产党的报纸存在。”事实是如此。可是，这些先生们似乎不懂得：第一，资产阶级把它本身之外的自由实现到多大的程度，都是以资产阶级的安全为转移的。只有在资产阶级认为这种自由对它的根本利益没有多大的妨碍的时候，它才可以给予这种自由。海德公园——这块在警察“保护”下的“自由天地”，对英国的政治起过什么重要的影响吗？没有。它阻止得了艾登发动侵略埃及的肮脏战争吗？它劝说得了麦克米伦去禁止载着氢弹的美国飞机在英伦三岛上空飞行吗？都不能。既然如此，而且保留这种自由形式，还可以成为标榜资产阶级自由的点缀品，那么英国资产阶级何乐而不为呢？应该说，在这种自由形式的后面其实正是一种隐蔽的资产阶级专政。第二，资产阶级国家宪法上的自由能实现到多大程度，还决定于全世界和它本国的资产阶级同无产阶级的力量的对比。法国、意大利、美国等国家有共产党和他们的报纸存在，这并不是资产阶级的赐予，而是无产阶级斗争得来的。资本主义国家的共产党及其报纸经常受到迫害和限制，就足以表明它们的存在并不是资产阶级的慷慨赐予了。
    资产阶级一贯喜欢玩弄所谓一般的、全民的自由的词句，以便掩盖资产阶级专政的实质。可是，我们则公开宣布，我们所实行的是社会主义民主自由，即保障多数人的自由，限制少数人的自由。资产阶级右派曾经说过，在国民党统治时期，他们的自由还只是一个多少的问题，而在社会主义社会里，对他们说，自由就是一个有无的问题了。这种论调一方面是歪曲我国当前政治生活的现实，因为在我国，今天资产阶级还有宪法上所规定的自由，即使对一些资产阶级右派分子，今天也还没有完全剥夺他们一切政治权利。另一方面，这种论断也反映了一个历史事实，这就是在实行社会主义革命中，我们的确剥夺了资产阶级要想在中国发展资本主义、建立资产阶级专政的自由，并且要彻底消灭资产阶级及其一切自由。因为这是一个资产阶级最终命运问题，所以资产阶级右派总是企图与无产阶级较量，因而在中国共产党宣布整风运动以后，他们认为复辟资本主义的时机已到，于是从各方面发动进攻，企图实现资产阶级的自由。然而，事实证明，这种资本主义复辟的希望在中国是没有实现的可能了。
    我们不能不看到，资产阶级这种复辟思潮，是有其广泛的社会思想基础的，这就是小资产阶级的无政府主义倾向。我们知道，无政府主义主要是一种小资产阶级和流氓无产阶级的思想，它们由于所处的经济地位而把一切国家政权和组织纪律都看成是自由的镣铐。资产阶级，特别在他们掌握政权的时候，也反对极端的无政府主义，可是无政府主义也能成为他们反对无产阶级和社会主义的武器。因此，现时的无政府主义思想是有利于资产阶级复辟，而有害于无产阶级专政和社会主义建设的。当然，具有无政府主义倾向的人，不一定都是右派分子，但是，如果对这种观点，不去严格批判，任其发展，其结果必然会堕落到右派的泥坑里去。在前一个时期，当资产阶级右派向共产党和社会主义进行猖狂进攻的时候，某些具有无政府主义倾向的人，自觉或不自觉地跟着右派分子叫嚷，为他们效劳和摇旗呐喊，就是很明显的例子。他们也企图把资产阶级的自由同无产阶级的自由调和起来，赞成在社会主义制度中掺杂一些资本主义制度的东西，以便实现他们的所谓“绝对自由”。例如，他们不把“百花齐放、百家争鸣”当作一个斗争的口号，认为毒草不必锄掉，主张资产阶级与无产阶级在学术领域内平分秋色、互不干扰，他们认为文艺创作不要提出为工农兵服务的方向，新闻事业应该独立自主，科学研究需要分散地、自发地进行。显然，他们向往着一种摆脱党的领导和社会主义计划的“绝对自由”。这种为自由而自由的主张，显然是错误的观点。毛泽东同志说过，我们的自由是有领导的自由，不是无政府状态，无政府状态不符合人民的利益和愿望。
    同时，我们知道，世界上任何一个地方以及任何一个时候，也没有“绝对自由”这件事情。普列汉诺夫在通俗地解释黑格尔关于“自由是对于必然的认识”这个论点的时候，已经充分说明了绝对自由是不可能的，自由都是有条件的，都具有服从的因素。他说：“一切问题的焦点是在于必然这两个字究竟作怎样解释？亚里士多德曾经说，必然这个概念有着各种不同的意义：要身体健康，必然要服药；要生活，必然要呼吸；要借债，必然要到守财奴地方去。”这就是所谓有条件的必然。“假使他要获得收成，他就必然要播种；假使他要打死野兽，他就必然要放箭；假使他要推动蒸气机，他就必然要积蓄燃料等等。……人对自然的这种服从是人得到解放的条件。人服从自然，因而也就增加人的支配自然的权力，即增加他的自由。在有计划的社会生产组织下也是如此。人们在服从某种技术和经济的必然的要求时，也许会结束那种人们受人们自己的产物所统治的盲目的制度，也就是说，人们也许会大大增加自己的自由。在这里，他们的服从也许就要成为他们解放的来源。”
    具有无政府主义观点的人，正是不能正确理解这种自由和必然的关系，因此，他们往往把自由和社会主义的路线、计划以及党性原则等等对立起来，好像党的领导和社会主义的路线、计划，都是妨碍自由的东西。他们不懂得：第一，社会主义路线和社会主义的计划，都是根据社会和自然生活的客观发展规律而制定的，也就是一种“必然的要求”，因而服从这种路线、计划，就必然地会促进我们各项革命工作和建设事业，也就是推动社会生产力自由迅速地发展。例如苏联的科学研究工作是完全置于社会主义计划之内的，因而能够在短短的期间内，使得两颗红色小月亮上天，而资产阶级右派所吹嘘的美国科学自由，如说什么在资本主义国家里可以有计算宇宙半径的自由，为什么它们迟迟至今连一个马铃薯也抛不上去呢？这难道不是很好的对照吗？
    第二，我们强调党性原则和纪律、集中的必要性，都是为着保证社会主义路线、计划的彻底实现。没有强大有力的共产党的领导，一切社会主义路线、计划都必然会流于空话。而共产党的领导，则具体表现在它的广大党员的大公无私的献身精神，为实现党的一切决议的高度纪律性和组织性。因此，当一个共产党员意识到必须把他的生命完全献给伟大的社会主义事业的时候，难道不是最大的自由吗？所以在一定意义上说，我们的党性原则正是促进社会生产力获得自由发展的保证。
    有人把自由生活当做人类的最终目的，这种看法也是不正确的。我们最高的理想是共产主义，在共产主义社会里，社会生产力必然获得自由的大发展，这是毫无疑问的，这是我们伟大的奋斗目标。但是，就是在那个时候，在人类生活特别是社会生活中，人们仍然必须有纪律有组织，服从集中的管理，而绝不会处于自由散漫毫无拘束的无政府状态。可以说，人类的社会生活将不是越来越散漫，而是越来越组织得有秩序。也就是说，既有自由，又有纪律、既有民主，又有集中，既有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼。
    现在看来，无政府主义观点很容易和资产阶级的复辟思潮结合起来。可能有一些人在向往绝对自由和平等的时候，主观上并没有意识到这就会帮助资本主义制度在我国复辟，但在客观上只能是这样的结果。因此，无论是“全民自由”或是“绝对自由”这一类关于自由的谬论，都必须坚决地加以揭穿。正如列宁所指出的，在资产阶级制度建立的时代，自由、平等、私有财产等等是他们最响亮的口号；而我们这个社会主义时代的口号，即应当是：消灭阶级，实行无产阶级专政，无情地揭穿一切关于自由之类的谬论和成见。所以说，在思想战线上，我们无产阶级还必须长期地同资产阶级的复辟思潮——关于自由的一切谬论，进行坚决的斗争。
