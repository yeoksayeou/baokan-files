    Raising Literacy Awareness Through Socialist Debate
    Meitan County's Farmers Put Effort into Literacy

    (Reported by this newspaper) Meitan County, Guizhou Province, has launched a literacy campaign in conjunction with current agricultural production and the socialist debate in the countryside. The county has established 1,522 people's schools, organizing over 40,000 people to enroll.

    Initially, the county leadership lacked confidence in carrying out literacy work, believing that the debate was tense and the water conservancy tasks were heavy. After implementing the spirit of the provincial literacy work conference and specifically analyzing the new situation in the countryside, they realized that launching a debate on literacy in conjunction with the major debate was a favorable condition for mobilizing the masses to enroll this year. Heping Township in the Fourth District, through debate, increased from an original one people's school with just over 30 people to 31 people's schools with 410 students and increased the number of teachers from the original two to 40. Qingjiang Township in the Sixth District, through debate, increased from the original 27 regular people's schools to 67, and the number of students increased from over 500 to over 900. In water conservancy construction, because the literacy objects have formed a collective, and the commune members live and eat on the construction site without family burdens, it is more conducive to promoting literacy work. Now, at the Meijiang water conservancy and Zhangchanggou Reservoir projects, more than 1,000 people are digging earth every day, and the county has assigned a literacy instructor specifically to organize everyone to study on the construction site. Due to the leadership's attention, the broad masses of farmers are very enthusiastic about literacy.

    In order to enrich the teaching content and improve the socialist consciousness of the farmers, the County Bureau of Culture and Education has also drawn a cadre to specifically collect materials from the debates on "anti-concealment of production" and "on the superiority of cooperation" to compile supplementary teaching materials.

    通过社会主义辩论　提高扫盲认识
    湄潭县广大农民识字下功夫
    本报讯　贵州省湄潭县结合当前农业生产和农村社会主义大辩论，开展了扫盲工作。全县设立了一千五百二十二个民校，组织了四万多人入学。
    县的领导上起先认为大辩论紧张、水利任务大，因此对开展扫盲工作缺乏信心。经过贯彻省扫盲工作会议的精神和具体分析了农村的新情况以后，才明确了结合大辩论，开展对扫盲工作的辩论，正是今年发动群众入学的有利条件。四区和平乡通过辩论由原有三十多人的一个民校，增到三十一个民校，学员达四百一十人，教师由原来的两人，增到四十人。六区清江乡通过辩论，由原来的二十七个常年民校增加到六十七个，学员由五百多人增到九百多人。在兴修水利中，由于扫盲对象已组成了一个集体，社员食宿都在工地上，无家务牵挂，更有利于推动扫盲工作。现在湄江的水利和张长沟水库工程，每天都有一千多人挖土，县里配备一个扫盲辅导员专门到工地上组织大家学习。由于领导重视，广大农民识字热情都很高。
    为了充实教学内容，提高农民的社会主义觉悟，县文教局还抽了一个干部专门收集“反瞒产”和“关于合作化优越性”辩论的材料，编写补充教材。　（卢今吾）（附图片）
