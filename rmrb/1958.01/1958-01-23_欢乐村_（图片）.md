"Happy Village"
    Wulao Village is a slum area in Nanjing. Before liberation, it was a stinking ditch, and people called Wulao Village "Suffering Village." In 1952, when the patriotic health campaign was vigorously launched throughout the country, the residents of Wulao Village actively took action, cleared decades of accumulated garbage, opened up roads, and eliminated a large number of mosquitoes and flies. Now it has become a "Happy Village" loved by everyone. This is a picture of housewives washing rice and vegetables. Xinhua News Agency reporter Ding Jun

    “欢乐村”
    五老村是南京市的一个棚户区，解放前这里是臭水坑，人们把五老村称为“苦恼村”。1952年全国轰轰烈烈地开展爱国卫生运动时，五老村的居民就积极行动起来，清除了积存几十年的垃圾，开辟了道路，消灭了大量蚊子和苍蝇，现在已经变成人人喜爱的“欢乐村”了。这是主妇们正在淘米、洗菜。　新华社记者　丁峻摄
