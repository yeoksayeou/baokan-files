A Model of Diligence and Frugality - Yan Taoxiang
    Yang Bingchang Huang Hua Xiang Hongjia
    In Pengxing Township, Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, there is a woman named Yan Taoxiang. She is the deputy director of the Heping No. 2 Cooperative in the township. Everyone who knows her says she is a model of diligence and frugality, an example of loving the cooperative like her own home.

    Changes in Five Years
    Yan Taoxiang is already a mother of four. Her family consists of five people, with the oldest child being fifteen years old and the youngest only six. In 1952, her husband passed away, leaving behind a debt of one hundred and seventy-two yuan. From that time on, Yan Taoxiang shouldered the responsibility of providing for her family of five.

    "How can a woman support the whole family?" When her husband died, Yan Taoxiang's eyes were swollen with tears, and she fell into despair. At this time, Yan Renshuang, the secretary of the township Party committee, personally came to comfort her, encourage her, help her arrange her household affairs, and tell her to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. She gradually understood the Party's policy of mutual aid and cooperation, and actively participated in mutual aid teams, elementary cooperatives, and advanced cooperatives. Through diligent production and attention to thrift, she finally solved her living difficulties. From joining the mutual aid team in 1953 to joining the advanced cooperative in 1956, she repaid one hundred and twenty-seven yuan of old debts, paid the cooperative's share capital, and bought five yuan of government bonds. Last year, the whole family earned four thousand and forty-one work points, receiving a reward of three hundred and twenty-three yuan. Adding the manure money of twenty-four yuan and five jiao, the total income was three hundred and forty-seven yuan and five jiao. The family's sideline income of seventy-five yuan and six jiao was additional. With this money, besides buying food and miscellaneous items, she paid off the government loan, paid off the old debts, bought pigs, bought government bonds, and redeemed the two and a half houses that had been pawned six years ago. The extra money was deposited in the cooperative. Now, Yan Taoxiang's family is a farming household that owes no state loans, no private debts, has enough to eat and wear, and has surplus money.

    Diligent Production, Diligent Housekeeping
    Yan Taoxiang loves labor very much, and she understands that only through labor can one have happiness. Therefore, she has a high attendance rate, and she does every job, even if it's only worth a fraction of a work point. In winter, when digging pond mud, it's freezing cold, and other women are afraid to go to work, but she actively participates in digging mud. Her hands are frozen and cracked, and her feet are numb with cold, but she never complains. When it rains, others rest, but she braves the rain to collect manure and accumulate fertilizer; sometimes, when the work of her own group is finished, she goes to other groups to find work. Last year, although Yan Taoxiang served as the deputy director of the cooperative, she still earned two thousand two hundred and six work points. In one year, apart from the days she was delayed by the New Year and attending the provincial and county labor model conferences, she worked a full three hundred and twenty working days.

    Yan Taoxiang participates in a lot of labor for the cooperative, and she also does a lot of housework. When she comes back from work, she plants vegetables in her own garden, ensuring that her family has vegetables to eat. She also raises a pig and twenty-four chickens. The annual income solves the family's expenses for oil, salt, needles, thread, haircuts, and tuition. Before last year's final accounting, the cooperative gave her eight yuan for pocket money, but she was reluctant to spend it. The clothes, shoes, and socks of the whole family of five are all made by her own hands. Last year, she made nineteen pairs of shoes and six pieces of clothing. She does needlework whenever she has free time in the evening. Once, she attended a ten-day meeting in the province. While others rested before and after the meeting, she took the time to make three pairs of shoe soles, large and small, and two pieces of children's clothing.

    The Whole Family Works Hard
    Yan Taoxiang, in a large family with many children, is able to find time to participate in labor, which is inseparable from her orderly arrangement of household affairs. She pays special attention to cultivating the children's labor perspective, assigning specific tasks to the children, and often holding family meetings to check on the children's work. The fifteen-year-old eldest daughter, Jufang, cooks breakfast and dinner, feeds the pigs, washes clothes, and takes care of housework. After meals, she goes to work in production, earning eight hundred and seventy-eight work points last year. The twelve-year-old second daughter, Yunfang, grazes a buffalo, bringing the well-fed buffalo home at noon to cook lunch, earning nine hundred and seven work points last year. The ten-year-old third daughter is in school. In addition to reviewing her lessons after school, she also collects wild feed for the pigs and cleans the house inside and out. This year, she has accumulated more than six hundred catties of coarse feed for pigs, such as shrimp-shaped grass and soybean leaves, earning thirty-two work points. The six-year-old youngest son, Deming, seeing his sisters working, is unwilling to lag behind. This year, he picked two hundred catties of manure, earning eighteen work points. The cooperative members generally reflect: "Yan Taoxiang's family is as busy as a nest of swallows."

    Living Frugally
    Yan Taoxiang pays close attention to saving money and has come up with many ways to save. Take eating grain, for example, Yan Taoxiang knows that saving grain is beneficial to the country, the cooperative, and herself. The year before last, there was a bumper harvest, and the cooperative distributed three thousand one hundred catties of grain to her family (including increased production grain). As a result, they only ate two thousand five hundred and twenty catties. After keeping one hundred catties as reserve grain, the rest was sold to the state. Last year, her family averaged more than five hundred catties of food grain per person, and she planned to save two hundred catties of surplus grain from the food grain for disaster prevention reserves. How did she save grain? Yan Taoxiang and her eldest daughter, Jufang, summarized the experience of "coarsely milling rice and finely grinding flour." As a result of coarse milling, one hundred catties of grain can produce six more catties of rice. Others grind wheat only five times, but her family grinds it seven times, and one hundred catties of wheat also produce seven and a half more catties of flour. Yan Taoxiang said: "Eating should be done so that every grain goes into the mouth and every bite goes into the stomach," "Even if you have ten thousand dan of white rice, you should be afraid of leftover porridge and rice. There are many tricks to cooking." When measuring rice, cook as much as the number of people eating, rather cook less than have leftovers. Sometimes, if there is not enough rice, they mix vegetables and cook soup rice. When washing rice, use a loofah cloth to wipe the rice water, so as not to lose rice. When cooking rice, cook the rice softer and longer, so that it is both soft and delicious. Last year, her family ate various vegetables totaling one thousand six hundred catties, saving one hundred and sixty catties of rice.

    Yan Taoxiang's family always has leftover cloth coupons, mainly because she knows how to save cloth. The year before last, she had seven zhang and five chi of cloth coupons, but she only used two zhang and one chi. Last year, she received four zhang and five chi of cloth coupons, but she only used one zhang and nine chi. In the past two years, she has saved more than eight zhang of cloth coupons. She is also very thrifty in terms of clothing. As the old saying goes, "Clothes laugh at being torn, not at being patched." Yan Taoxiang adopts the method of "patching the old to make it new," continuing to wear old clothes after patching them. She has an old padded jacket that her eldest daughter wore for two years, her second daughter wore for two years, and now it's the turn of her youngest son, Deming, to wear it. The eldest daughter has a pair of broken wadded pants, which were altered for the third daughter to wear. In this way, four cotton clothes were made by using the small to make the big and the big to alter the small, so that the whole family could spend the winter warmly.

    Loving the Cooperative Like Home
    Yan Taoxiang is not only a model of diligence and thrift, but also an example of loving the cooperative like her own home. She said: "Without the cooperative, there would be no family of mine." Last spring, she took back a small, skinny calf that the cooperative members were unwilling to feed and personally raised it. Every night, she got up several times to take care of the cow. She usually saved edible oil, unwilling to eat it herself, and fried two meals of oil and salt rice for the cow to eat. The cooperative distributed nine catties of soybeans to her, but she was reluctant to make tofu and fed them to the cow instead. This small, skinny cow was finally fattened under her meticulous care. The cooperative members reflected: "Sister-in-law Yan cares for the cow more than she cares for her son!" One night in May, during a stormy and lightning-filled night, Yan Taoxiang tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep, thinking about the wheat in the warehouse. Later, she went to check the warehouse alone in the heavy rain and found that the warehouse was leaking. She used a foot basin to catch the leaking rain, protecting six thousand catties of wheat from damage.

    Yan Taoxiang's exemplary behavior has won the praise of the cooperative members. The cooperative members said: "Yan Taoxiang is an example for us to learn from." From 1955 to 1956, she was continuously selected by all the cooperative members as a special-class labor model and attended the provincial and county labor model conferences. In January 1956, the cooperative members unanimously elected her as the deputy director of the cooperative management committee. In April of the same year, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.

    勤劳节俭的模范——晏桃香
    杨炳昌　黄华　向洪甲
    湖北省孝感县朋兴乡有个晏桃香，她是这个乡和平二社的副主任，知道她的人，都说她是勤劳节俭的模范，爱社如家的榜样。
    五年来的变化
    晏桃香已经是四个孩子的妈妈，全家五口人，大孩子十五岁，小的才六岁。1952年丈夫病逝，留下一百七十二元的债务。从那时起，晏桃香便负担着一家五口人的生活。
    “一个妇道人家，怎能养活全家”？丈夫死的时候，晏桃香眼睛哭肿了，陷入了绝望的境地。这时，乡党委书记晏仁双亲自来安慰她，鼓励她，帮助她安排家务，告诉她走互助合作的道路。她逐渐懂得了党的互助合作政策，就积极参加了互助组，初级社，高级社；勤劳生产，注意节约，终于解决了生活上的困难。从1953年参加互助组起，到1956年入高级社止，她还了一百二十七元旧债，补交了入社股金，还买了五元公债。去年全家做了四千零四十一分，可得报酬三百二十三元，加上粪钱二十四元五角，共收入三百四十七元五角，家庭副业收入的七十五元六角还在外。这些钱除了买口粮、杂用外，还清了政府贷款，还完了旧债，买了猪，买了公债，并赎回了六年前当出去的两间半房子，多余的钱存入了社。现在，晏桃香家已经是个不欠国家贷款，不欠私人旧债，有吃穿，有余钱的农户了。
    勤劳生产　勤劳持家
    晏桃香非常热爱劳动，她懂得劳动才有幸福。因此出勤很多，一分半分的活她都一样做。冬天挖塘泥，天寒地冻，别的妇女都怕出工，她主动地参加挖泥，手冻得发裂，脚冻得发木，从不叫一声苦。天雨时，别人休息，她冒雨出外拣粪打青积肥；有时本组的活做完了，就到别组去找活做。去年一年，晏桃香虽然担任社里的副主任，还做了二千二百零六分；一年内，她除了过年和出席省、县劳模会议耽误的日子外，整整出勤三百二十个工作日。
    晏桃香参加社的劳动多，家务劳动做得也不少。放工回来就在自己园里种菜，保住了一家人吃菜；还养了一头猪，喂了二十四只鸡，一年的收入解决了家中的油盐，针线，剃头，学费等零用钱。去年决算前，社里分给她八元零用钱，她一直舍不得用。全家五口人的衣服鞋袜，也都是靠她的十指做的，去年做了十九双鞋子，六件衣服。晚上一有空就做针线。一次她在省里开了十天会，别人会前会后休息，她抽空做了大小鞋底三双和两件小孩衣服。
    全家都辛勤劳动
    晏桃香在多子女的家庭环境中，能够抽身参加劳动，是和她家务安排得有条有理分不开的。她特别注意培养孩子们的劳动观点，给小孩具体分工定责，还经常开家庭会检查孩子们的工作。十五岁的大女儿菊芳，做早、晚两餐饭，喂猪，洗衣服，料理家务，饭后出工生产，去年做了八百七十八分；十二岁的二女儿运芳放一头水牛，中午放饱牛回家做中饭，去年做了九百零七分；十岁的三女儿在上学，除放学回家温习功课，还收集猪吃的野生饲料，打扫屋内外的卫生，今年共积虾形草、黄豆叶等猪吃粗料六百多斤，做了三十二分；六岁的小儿子德明看见姐姐们都劳动，也不甘愿落后，今年拣了二百斤粪，做了十八分。社员们普遍反映：“晏桃香家像一窝燕子样的忙。”
    节俭过日子
    晏桃香十分注意省吃俭用，想了很多节约的办法。拿吃粮食来说，晏桃香深知节约粮食，对国家，合作社，自己都有好处。前年丰收了，社里分给他家粮食三千一百斤（包括增产粮），结果只吃了二千五百二十斤，除留一百斤作储备粮外，其余的都卖给了国家。去年她家平均每人分到口粮五百多斤，又计划从口粮中节约二百斤余粮，储备防荒。她怎样节约粮食呢？晏桃香同她大女儿菊芳总结了“粗碾米，细磨面”的经验。粗碾的结果，一百斤谷，能多出六斤米，别人磨小麦只磨五道，她家要磨七道，一百斤小麦也多出面七斤半。晏桃香说：“吃饭要做到粒粒到口，口口到肚”，“家有白米万担，只怕残粥残饭，做饭的窍门很多。”量米时多少人吃做多少，宁少煮不能剩饭；有时饭少了不够吃，就掺菜煮汤饭吃；洗米时，要用丝瓜抹布篾米水，不让跑米；煮饭时，饭煮烂些，多长饭，既软和又好吃。去年她家搭着吃了各种菜一千六百斤，节约大米一百六十斤。
    晏桃香家里的布票总是用不完，主要是她会节约用布。前年七丈五布票，她只用了两丈一。去年发了四丈五布票，只用了一丈九，两年来共节约布票八丈多。穿衣方面，也很节约。老话说得好，“衣服笑破不笑补”，晏桃香采取“补旧如新”的办法，把旧衣服补过后再继续穿。她有一件旧袄子，大女儿穿了两年，二女儿穿了两年，现在轮给小儿德明穿；大女儿有条破絮裤，改给三女儿穿了。这样以小就大，以大改小共做了四件棉衣，全家人就能暖暖和和过冬了。
    爱社如家
    晏桃香不光是勤俭持家的模范，也是爱社如家的榜样。她说：“没有合作社，就没有我一家。”去年春天，她把社员们都不愿喂的一头小瘦牛，牵回去亲自喂养。每天夜里，她几遍起来照看牛，她平常节约的食油，自己舍不得吃，炒了两次油盐饭给牛吃；社里分给她九斤黄豆，她舍不得打豆腐，也给牛吃了，这条小瘦牛，在她无微不至的关心调养下，终于喂肥壮了。社员们反映：“晏大嫂喂牛比喂她的儿子还关心！”5月间的一个狂风暴雨、雷电交加的夜里，晏桃香在床上翻来复去睡不着，一心记挂着仓库里的小麦，后来她独自一人冒着大雨去检查仓库，发现仓库漏雨，她拿脚盆接住了漏下的雨，保住了六千斤小麦免受损失。
    晏桃香这些模范行为，获得了社员们的赞扬。社员们说：“晏桃香是我们学习的榜样。”她在1955年到1956年连续被全体社员评选为特等劳动模范，出席了省、县劳模大会；1956年1月社员们一致选她为社管委会的副主任；同年4月，她光荣地参加了中国共产党。
