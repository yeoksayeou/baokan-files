Reaching New Heights

　　The Soviet Union is Researching and Manufacturing Photon Rockets

　　Soviet Scientists Point Out Inaccuracies in U.S. "Vanguard" Rocket Calculations

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 19th: An article published in the Soviet newspaper "Trud" on January 19th stated that the feasibility of manufacturing photon rockets has increased due to the successful utilization of atomic energy and the launching of artificial satellites by Soviet scientists. Further development in this area now hinges on the successful creation of a thermonuclear reactor that can operate for extended periods and be lightweight.

　　The article stated that the principle that light can exert pressure was first discovered by Russian scientist Lebedev in 1899. Photons are the material particles of light, and their pressure can be utilized in the engines of spacecraft. Photon rockets can approach the speed of light. A round trip from Earth to Mars would only take four to five days, and the risk of collision with interplanetary meteoroids during flight could also be reduced.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 18th: Prominent Soviet spaceflight expert Pobedonostsev believes that there are shortcomings in the theoretical calculations of the U.S. "Vanguard" rocket, which is intended to launch artificial Earth satellites. He said that without requiring improvements in the technological level of fuel and structure—that is, while maintaining the existing structural characteristics and effective exhaust velocity of the U.S. "Vanguard" rocket's stages—the rocket could be greatly improved by slightly changing the distribution of the "Tsiolkovsky number" of each stage.

    百尺竿头再进一步
    苏联在研究制造光子火箭
    苏联科学家指出美国“先锋号”火箭计算不确
    据新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联“劳动报”19日登载的一篇文章说，由于苏联科学家成功地利用了原子能和放射了人造卫星，制造光子火箭的现实性已经增加了。现在，这一方面进一步的发展，将有待于制造成功一种能够长期工作和重量不大的热核反应堆。
    这篇文章说，俄国科学家列别杰夫在1899年首先发现了光能够产生压力的原理。光子是光的物质微粒，它的压力能够在宇宙飞船的发动机中加以利用。光子火箭的速度接近光速。这种火箭从地球到火星来往一次，只要四、五天的时间，在飞行中还可以减少与星际陨石碰撞的危险。
    据新华社莫斯科18日电　苏联著名星际飞行专家波别多诺斯采夫认为，美国预定用来发射人造地球卫星的“先锋号”火箭在理论计算方面是有缺点的。他说，在保持美国“先锋号”火箭各级现有的结构特性和发动机抛射燃料的有效速度的情况下，也就是说，在并不要求提高在燃料和结构方面的技术水平的情况下，只要稍稍改变各级的“齐奥尔科夫斯基数”的分配，就可以大大改善这个火箭。
