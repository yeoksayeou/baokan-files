Explanation of the Draft Regulations on Household Registration of the People's Republic of China
Luo Ruiqing, Minister of Public Security of the People's Republic of China

Chairman, Vice-Chairpersons, and Members:

The Draft Regulations on Household Registration of the People's Republic of China were drafted based on the experience of household registration work over the past few years, after a long period of preparation and solicitation of opinions from public security organs in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, as well as relevant central departments. This draft regulation has been discussed and approved by the State Council's plenary meeting and is now submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation.

I have the following explanations regarding this draft regulation:

I. Why is it necessary to formulate household registration regulations?

In recent years, our country's household registration work, especially in cities, has established a certain foundation under the correct leadership of the Party and the government. This work has played an important role in socialist construction, protecting the rights and interests of citizens, and maintaining social order.

However, since our country has only been established for eight years, the current household registration system is still very incomplete. Its main shortcomings are:

First, the system is not unified enough. Not only are cities and rural areas not unified where they should be, but even one city and another are not completely unified.

Second, some systems that should be stipulated have not been, or have not been stipulated adequately. For example, public household management is unsound, there are no regulations to prevent the blind influx of rural populations into cities and to control household registration for those moving to border defense areas, and there are no appropriate restrictions on the household registration changes of those who have been legally deprived of their political rights, etc.

Third, some systems were suitable for the past situation, but today the situation has changed, and they need to be appropriately revised or abolished. Such as registration reports for hospital patients, daily reports for hotel guests, etc., have not been revised or abolished in a timely manner.

In order to strengthen and improve household registration work to meet the needs of the rapid development of socialist construction, to satisfy the growing demands of the people in political and social life, and to further maintain social order, it has become an urgent need to formulate a relatively complete and nationally unified household registration regulation.

The Draft Regulations on Household Registration of the People's Republic of China were formulated based on the above specific circumstances and practical needs, and in accordance with the spirit of Article 49, Paragraph 12 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China: "protecting national interests, maintaining public order, and guaranteeing citizens' rights." We believe that the implementation of these regulations will play the following three roles in national construction and the people's lives:

First, accurately and promptly grasp the distribution, increase, decrease, and change of the national population, providing demographic data for our country to carry out socialist construction in a planned way, to compile national economic plans, to correctly implement the policy of unified purchase and sale, to comprehensively arrange labor employment and labor allocation, and to control birth, and other important policies and measures.

Second, prove the identity of citizens to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the people in political and social life. For example, protecting the people's right to vote and stand for election, protecting the people's legitimate freedom of residence and movement, issuing certificates for the people's employment, education, and purchase of grain and cloth, and helping people find the addresses of relatives and friends, etc.

Third, plug certain gaps in public security management, restrict the destructive activities of counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements, and protect the safety of national construction and the people's lives.

From these roles, it can be seen that household registration regulations are an important measure in our country's administrative management. It serves the country's socialist construction and is related to the vital interests of the broad masses of the people.

II. Regarding the specific content of the draft regulations, there are a few points that need to be explained:

First, the various systems in the Draft Regulations on Household Registration are formulated following the principle of adapting to national construction and serving the people. These systems can be summarized as: permanent residence, temporary residence, birth, death, moving out, moving in, and changes and corrections of registration information. Among them, permanent residence registration mainly grasps the basic situation of the fixed residential population, while the other six registrations grasp the increase, decrease, and change of the population. These items are a unified whole, and without any one of them, the overall picture of the population cannot be grasped, and the needs of the country and the people cannot be met. Therefore, these systems are necessary and applicable in principle to both cities and rural areas.

However, in order to take into account the current inconvenience of transportation in rural areas and the relatively poor foundation of household registration work, some special provisions have been made in Articles 4, 8, 13, and 15. The requirements for rural household registration are lower than those for cities, and the procedures are simpler. For example, at present, rural areas only implement permanent residence registration and change registration for birth, death, moving out, and moving in, and do not implement temporary residence registration; the time limit for reporting moving in is set at within three days in cities, while it is set at within ten days in rural areas; the time limit for reporting death is before burial in cities, while it is within one month in rural areas; cities establish household registration books on a household basis, while rural areas establish household registration books on a cooperative basis.

For the household registration of institutions, organizations, schools, enterprises, and public institutions, as well as agricultural, fishing, salt, forestry, animal husbandry, and handicraft production cooperatives, special provisions have also been made in Article 3 according to the actual situation, requiring each unit to designate special personnel to assist the household registration authorities in handling registration. There are many benefits to doing so: first, it is convenient for employees and cooperative members to register their household registration; second, the personnel and administrative departments of each unit can understand the population changes at any time; third, it is convenient for cooperatives to formulate plans, organize production, or distribute income; and fourth, it is convenient for the household registration authorities to manage household registration.

The content and procedures of the draft regulations show that it both meets the needs of national construction and social life and takes into account the convenience of the masses. This is a characteristic of our household registration system.

Second, regarding the issue of preventing the blind influx of rural populations into cities.

Paragraph 2 of Article 10 stipulates: "Citizens moving from rural areas to cities must hold an employment certificate from the urban labor department, an admission certificate from a school, or a permit to move in from the urban household registration authority, and apply to the household registration authority at their permanent residence to handle the moving out procedures." Why do we do this? In the current situation, the phenomenon of the blind influx of rural populations into cities has been relatively serious in recent years, and some institutions and enterprises have not seriously implemented the policy of shrinking the urban population, and even privately recruit workers, casually writing letters to rural areas to request household registration certificates; some units not only do not actively assist the government in mobilizing people who have blindly flowed into cities without household registration to return to their hometowns, but instead use certain conveniences of institutions and enterprises to allow them to live there for a long time. This has further exacerbated the seriousness of this chaotic situation, bringing many difficulties to the various construction plans and normal life order of cities, making the problems of transportation, housing, supply, employment, and schooling in some cities tense. At the same time, the large outflow of rural labor has also affected the development of agricultural production and construction, which is not conducive to the development of agricultural production, and thus is not conducive to the entire socialist construction.

From a long-term perspective, our country's socialist construction policy is to develop industry and agriculture simultaneously on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. Both industrial and agricultural production must be carried out in accordance with the unified plans of the state. Therefore, the labor force in both cities and rural areas should adapt to the needs of socialist construction and be arranged in a unified and planned manner. We must not allow the urban labor force to increase blindly, nor should we allow the rural labor force to flow out blindly. Moreover, our country's current situation is that there is already too much urban labor, while rural production has great potential and can accommodate a large amount of labor. Therefore, the government is mobilizing cadres and graduates from large, middle, and primary schools to go to the countryside and mountains, which makes it easier to understand the necessity of preventing the blind outflow of the agricultural population.

In addition, rural populations who blindly flow into cities will have difficulty finding jobs, and their lives will become difficult. Some people will become vagrants, and a few will even be seduced by bad elements to engage in theft, fraud, and other criminal activities, disrupting urban social order.

It can be seen that properly solving the problem of the blind influx of rural populations into cities is not only a need of the country, but also a demand of the broad masses of the people. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council recently issued "Instructions on Preventing the Blind Outflow of Rural Populations" in response to this situation, requiring "strict household registration management" to prevent the blind outflow of rural populations. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to make corresponding provisions on this issue in the household registration regulations. Of course, to prevent the blind influx of rural populations into cities, we must mainly rely on the various tasks of the Party and the government, especially on doing a good job in mass work, relying on the majority to persuade the minority, in order to fully achieve the goal. However, a sound household registration work is also a necessary condition.

Third, appropriately control the household registration of people moving to border defense areas. Paragraph 3 of Article 10 stipulates: "Citizens moving to border defense areas must be approved by the public security organs of the county, city, or urban district of their permanent residence." This is because a large part of our country's border defense areas are the gateway to our national defense. In order to maintain social security in these areas and protect the safety of the national defense outposts, it is necessary to have certain approval procedures for the incoming population.

Fourth, the issue of citizens going out and temporarily residing for personal reasons. Article 16 stipulates: "If a citizen leaves their permanent residence for personal reasons and stays out for more than three months, they shall apply to the household registration authority for an extension of time or handle the relocation procedures; if there is no reason to extend the time and no conditions for relocation, they shall return to their permanent residence." This provision does not impose any restrictions on the normal outings and temporary residences of the broad masses of the people. Because from the actual situation, the time required for citizens to go out and temporarily reside for visiting relatives, friends, medical treatment, travel, etc., is generally sufficient for three months. If it is necessary to extend the time of going out or temporary residence, as long as the reason is explained to the household registration authority, it can be extended; if it meets the conditions for relocation and they are willing to relocate, they can also handle the relocation procedures. The time on the road for long distances does not have to be included within three months. This provision is indeed a restriction on a small number of people who do not engage in proper occupations, are idle, and use going out and temporary residence to wander around for a long time, not engaging in production and disrupting social order. But it is entirely right to restrict such people, because doing so will enable them to settle down in production posts, which is entirely necessary to guarantee social production and order and to reform themselves.

Fifth, Article 14 stipulates: "Prisoners on parole or probation, those under supervision, and others who have been legally deprived of their political rights must be approved by the county, city, or urban district people's court or public security organ through the household registration authority before they can handle the moving out registration; after arriving at the place of relocation, they shall immediately declare the moving in registration to the household registration authority." The purpose of this provision is to prevent some of them from taking advantage of household registration relocation to escape supervision and reform, or to engage in criminal activities. Doing so is not only beneficial to social security, but also beneficial to the reform of these people.

III. Do some of the restrictive provisions in the draft regulations conflict with the freedom of residence and movement of citizens?

It should be said that there is no conflict.

I have already said before that our household registration system, in its specific role, is not only an important measure for serving socialist construction and maintaining social security order, but also an important measure for directly protecting the political rights and economic interests of the broad masses of the people. In its fundamental purpose, it serves to create a happy and beautiful future for our people in political and economic terms. Therefore, it will not only not conflict with the freedom of the broad masses of the people, but also protect the freedom of the broad masses of the people.

As everyone knows, we are a socialist country. Overall consideration and proper arrangement are the fundamental principles of our country. Whether it is developing the national economy or improving the people's lives, it is carried out according to the unified plans of the state and must proceed from the interests of the people of the whole country. Chairman Mao instructed us: "When we make plans, do things, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has 600 million people, and we must never forget this point." The Draft Regulations on Household Registration were drafted precisely according to this principle, considering the strengthening and improvement of household registration management. Some of the restrictive provisions in the draft regulations, such as preventing the blind outflow of rural populations, controlling the household registration of people moving to border defense areas, and the provisions on the time of citizens going out and temporarily residing, are all based on the principle of the state's overall arrangement, thinking about the 600 million people, being responsible for the 600 million people, and protecting the political rights and economic interests of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, it does not conflict with the democratic freedom of the broad masses of the people, but protects the democratic freedom of the broad masses of the people; it does not conflict with the freedom of residence and movement of citizens, but protects the freedom of residence and movement of citizens.

Of course, some of the restrictive provisions in our Draft Regulations on Household Registration do conflict with the blind flow and migration behavior of a few people who only care about themselves and disregard the interests of the country and the collective. But this conflict does not restrict the freedom of residence and movement of citizens. This is because the freedom stipulated in the Constitution is freedom with leadership, not a state of anarchy; it is the freedom of the broad masses of the people, not the absolute personal freedom of a few people. If a few people are allowed to have absolute personal freedom, allowing a few people to have the freedom of blind flow and migration that only cares about themselves and disregards the interests of the country and the collective, then it will inevitably make it impossible for the state's overall arrangement policy and the socialist construction plan to be implemented smoothly, and will inevitably harm the normal order of work, study, and life of the broad masses of the people. The result will inevitably hinder the freedom of the broad masses of the people, and of course will also hinder the freedom of residence and movement of citizens. Therefore, restricting the unreasonable blind flow and migration "freedom" of a few people is precisely to protect the legitimate freedom of residence and movement of the majority of people. Moreover, it should also be seen that for these few people, it is only restricting their unreasonable behavior of blind flow and migration, and we do not restrict their legitimate freedom of residence and migration in the slightest. For example, citizens residing in rural areas, as long as they hold employment or admission certificates issued by urban labor departments or schools, or a certificate of permission to move in issued by urban household registration authorities, can completely move to cities and will not be subject to any restrictions. At the same time, for these few people, restricting their unreasonable behavior of blind flow and migration is precisely beneficial to themselves. If they are allowed to deviate from the state's overall arrangements, violate the collective interests of the broad masses of the people, and blindly flow and migrate, it will be detrimental to the country and the people, and also detrimental to themselves. Because only when the country develops can they develop; only when everyone lives a good life can they live a good life. Just imagine, if a person deviates from the state's arrangements and violates the interests of the collective, how can their personal political rights and economic interests be truly guaranteed?

It can be seen that some of the restrictive provisions in the draft regulations are completely consistent with the constitutional provision that "citizens of the People's Republic of China have the freedom of residence and movement." We believe that the broad masses of the people understand this principle based on their personal experiences in political and social life, and therefore will support these measures.

IV. How to implement these regulations?

Household registration regulations are closely related to everyone, and it is necessary to rely on everyone's consciousness to implement them. Now the level of awareness and organization of the broad masses has been unprecedentedly improved, and most of the masses have developed the habit of complying with the household registration system. However, there are still a few people who have not complied with or have not complied with this system well. Some of them are due to not understanding the content and significance of this system, and some are due to selfishness and laziness. In addition, there are also some counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements who deliberately undermine this system. Therefore, in implementing these regulations, we must adopt the policy of relying on the majority, urging the minority, and preventing bad people. We should fully carry out propaganda and education work among the people, so that the significance of household registration work and various systems are known to every household and understood by everyone. Household registration authorities and household registration workers should contact the masses, rely on the masses, facilitate the masses, and help them solve difficulties in their work, and serve the masses diligently. For those who violate the household registration system, the main method is to persuade and educate them. Only those who have committed acts that violate public security administration will be given appropriate punishment, and the purpose of the punishment is still to educate them. Counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements who undermine the household registration system and engage in criminal activities must be punished according to law. We believe that as long as we resolutely rely on the masses and obtain the support of the broad masses, these new household registration regulations will be well implemented.

### 关于中华人民共和国户口登记条例草案的说明

    关于中华人民共和国户口登记条例草案的说明
    中华人民共和国公安部部长　罗瑞卿委员长、各位副委员长、各位委员：
    中华人民共和国户口登记条例草案，是根据几年来户口登记工作的经验，经过长期的准备，征求了各省、自治区、市公安机关和中央有关部门的意见起草出来的。这个条例草案，已经国务院全体会议讨论通过，现在提请人大常委会审议。
    对于这个条例草案，我有以下几点说明：
    一、为什么要制定户口登记条例？
    几年来，我国的户口登记工作，特别是城市的户口登记工作，在党和政府的正确领导下，已经建立了一定的基础。这一工作，对于社会主义建设，保护公民的权利和利益，维持社会秩序，起了重要的作用。
    但是，由于我们的国家建立才八年，现行的户口登记制度还是很不完备的，它的主要缺陷是：
    第一、制度不够统一，不仅城市和农村应该统一的没有统一，就是这个城市和那个城市也不完全统一。
    第二、有些应当规定的制度，没有规定，或者规定得不够妥善。例如：公共户口管理不健全，没有规定制止农村人口盲目流入城市和控制迁往边防地区的户口，以及没有适当限制那些依法被剥夺了政治权利的人的户口变动，等等。
    第三、还有一些制度，适合过去的情况，今天情况变了，需要适当地加以修改或者废除。如像住医院病人的登记报告，旅店来客的每日报告，等等，都没有适时地加以修改或者废除。
    为了加强和健全户口登记工作，以适应社会主义建设迅速发展的需要，满足人民在政治生活和社会生活中日益增长的要求，进一步维护社会秩序，制定一个比较完备的全国统一的户口登记条例，已经成为当前的迫切需要了。
    中华人民共和国户口登记条例草案，就是从上述具体情况和实际需要出发，根据中华人民共和国宪法第四十九条第十二项“保护国家利益，维护公共秩序，保障公民权利”的精神制定的。这个条例的实行，对国家建设和人民生活所起的作用，我们以为有以下三个方面：
    第一、准确地及时地掌握全国人口的分布、增减和变动情况，为我国有计划地进行社会主义建设，编制国民经济计划，正确地贯彻统购统销，统筹安排劳动就业和劳动力调配，以及节制生育等等重要政策措施，提供人口资料。
    第二、证明公民的身份，以保护人民群众在政治生活和社会生活中的合法权利和利益。例如：保护人民行使选举权和被选举权，保护人民正当的居住和迁徙自由，为人民的劳动就业和受教育、购买粮布等出具证明，帮助人民查询亲友地址，等等。
    第三、堵塞治安管理中的某些空隙，限制反革命分子和其他坏分子的破坏活动，保卫国家建设和人民生活的安全。
    从这些作用中可以看到，户口登记条例是我们国家在行政管理上的一项重要措施。它是服务于国家的社会主义建设，并和广大人民的切身利益相关联的。
    二、对于条例草案的具体内容，有几点需要解释：
    第一、户口登记条例草案的各项制度，都是遵循着适应国家建设，为人民群众服务的原则制定的。这些制度概括起来，就是：常住、暂住、出生、死亡、迁出、迁入和变更更正等七项登记。其中，常住人口登记，主要是掌握固定居住人口的基本状况，而其他六项登记，则是掌握人口的增减和变动情况。这些项目是一个统一的整体，缺少了任何一项，都不能掌握人口的全貌，都不能满足国家和人民的要求。因此，这些制度都是必需的，无论城市和农村，原则上都是适用的。
    但是，为了照顾农村目前交通不便，户口工作基础较差等情况，在第四、第八、第十三、第十五等四条中，都特别作了一些规定。对农村户口登记的要求，比城市要低一些，手续更简便一些。如像：农村目前只实行常住人口登记和出生、死亡、迁出、迁入等项变动登记，不实行暂住人口登记；迁入申报的时限，城市定为三天以内，而农村则定为十天以内；死亡申报的时限，城市是在葬前，农村是在一个月以内；城市以户为单位设户口簿，而农村则以合作社为单位设户口簿。
    对于机关、团体、学校、企业、事业等单位和农业、渔业、盐业、林业、牧畜业、手工业等生产合作社的户口登记，也根据实际情况，在第三条中作了专门的规定，要求各单位指定专人，协助户口登记机关办理登记。这样办好处很多：一是职工、社员登记户口方便；二是各单位的人事、行政工作可以随时了解人口变动情况；三是便于合作社制定计划、组织生产或者进行收益分配；四是便于户口登记机关的户口管理。
    从条例草案的内容和手续上都可以说明，既满足国家建设和社会生活的需要，又照顾到便利群众，这是我们户口登记制度的一个特点。
    第二、关于制止农村人口盲目流入城市的问题。
    在第十条第二款中规定：“公民由农村迁往城市，必须持有城市劳动部门的录用证明，学校的录取证明，或者城市户口登记机关的准予迁入的证明，向常住地户口登记机关申请办理迁出手续。”为什么要这样办呢？就当前情况来说，因为近几年来，农村人口盲目流入城市的现象比较严重，而有些机关、企业单位，也没有认真执行紧缩城市人口的方针，甚至私自招工，随便写信向农村索要户口证明；有些单位对于从农村盲目流入城市没有户口的人员，不仅不积极协助政府动员还乡，反而利用机关、企业的某些便利，让其长期居住。这样就更加助长了这种混乱情形的严重性，给城市的各项建设计划和正常的生活秩序带来了许多困难，使得有些城市的交通、住房、供应、就业、上学等等问题，都出现了一定的紧张局面。同时，由于农村劳动力的大量外流，也影响农业生产建设的开展，对于发展农业生产不利，也就对整个社会主义建设不利。
    从长远情况看，我国社会主义建设的方针，是在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业同时并举。无论工业生产和农业生产，都必需按照国家统一的规划和计划进行。因此，城市和农村的劳动力，都应当适应社会主义建设的需要，进行统一的有计划的安排，既不能让城市劳动力盲目增加，也不能让农村劳动力盲目外流。而且，我国当前情况是城市劳动力已经过多，农村生产则有很大潜力，可以容纳大量劳动力。因此政府正在动员干部和大、中、小学毕业学生下乡上山，这就更不难了解要制止农业人口盲目外流的必要。
    此外，盲目流入城市的农村人口，因为找不到职业，生活就会发生困难，有些人就会流浪街头，少数人甚至会被坏分子所勾引，进行偷窃、诈骗等犯罪活动，破坏城市社会秩序。
    由此可见，适当地解决农村人口盲目流入城市的问题，不仅是国家的需要，也是广大人民的要求。中共中央和国务院最近针对这种情况，发出了“关于制止农村人口盲目外流的指示”，指示中要求“进行严格户口管理”，以制止农村人口盲目外流。因此，在户口登记条例中对于这个问题作相应的规定，是完全必要的。当然，要制止农村人口盲目流入城市，主要还是要依靠党和政府的各项工作，特别是要做好群众工作，依靠多数人来劝说少数人，才能完全达到目的。但是，健全的户口登记工作，也是一个必要的条件。
    第三、适当控制迁往边防地区的户口问题。在第十条第三款中规定：“公民迁往边防地区，必须经过常住地县、市、市辖区公安机关批准。”这是因为，我国很长一部分边防地区是我们国防的门户，为了维持这些地区的社会治安，保卫国防前哨的安全，对于迁入的人口经过一定的批准手续，是必要的。
    第四、公民因私事外出、暂住的问题。在第十六条中规定：“公民因私事离开常住地外出、暂住的时间超过三个月的，应当向户口登记机关申请延长时间或者办理迁移手续；既无理由延长时间又无迁移条件的，应当返回常住地。”这个规定，对于广大人民正常的外出、暂住是没有任何约束的。因为从实际情况来看，公民因探亲、访友、治病、旅行等外出、暂住所需要的时间，一般的说三个月是足够的。如果需要延长外出、暂住时间，只要向户口登记机关讲明理由，就可以延长；合乎迁移条件愿意迁移的，也可以办理迁移手续。路途遥远的，旅途中的时间还可以不计算在三个月以内。这个规定对于少数不务正业，游手好闲，利用外出、暂住长期流浪在外，不事生产，扰乱社会秩序的分子来说，确是一种约束。但是对于这种人加以约束，是完全应该的，因为这样做，才能使他们在生产岗位定居下来，这对于保证社会生产和生活秩序以及改造他们本人，都是完全必要的。
    第五、第十四条规定：“被假释、缓刑的犯人，被管制分子和其他依法被剥夺政治权利的人，在迁移的时候，必须经过户口登记机关转报县、市、市辖区人民法院或者公安机关批准，才可以办理迁出登记；到达迁入地后，应当立即向户口登记机关申报迁入登记。”这样规定的目的，是为了防止他们中间的一些人，利用户口迁移，逃避监督改造，或者从事犯罪活动。这样做，不仅对社会治安有利，就是对这些人的改造也有好处。
    三、条例草案中某些带有约束性的规定，同公民的居住和迁徙自由是否有抵触呢？
    应该说是没有抵触的。
    我在前面已经说过，我们的户口登记制度，就其具体作用来说，不仅是服务于社会主义建设和维护社会治安秩序的一项重要措施，而且也是直接保护广大人民政治权利和经济利益的一项重要措施。就其根本目的来说，它就是为我国人民在政治上和经济上创造一个幸福的美好的前途而服务的。因此，它不但不会同广大人民的自由有抵触，而且是保护广大人民的自由的。
    大家都知道，我们是社会主义国家。统筹兼顾，适当安排，是我们国家的根本方针。无论是发展国民经济，或者是改善人民的生活，都是按照国家统一的计划进行的，都必须从全国人民的利益出发。毛主席指示我们说：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点”。户口登记条例草案正是根据这一方针，来考虑加强和健全户口管理工作的。条例草案中某些带有约束性的规定，比如制止农村人口盲目外流，控制迁往边防地区的户口，以及公民外出、暂住时间的规定等，也都是根据国家的统筹安排的方针，为六亿人口着想，对六亿人口负责，来保护广大人民的政治权利和经济利益的。因此，它同广大人民的民主自由是没有抵触的，而且是保护广大人民的民主自由的；它同公民的居住和迁徙自由是没有抵触的，而且是保护公民的居住和迁徙自由的。
    当然，我们户口登记条例草案中某些带有约束性的规定，对于少数人的只顾自己、不顾国家和集体利益的盲目流动迁徙行为，是有抵触的。但是这种抵触，并不是限制公民的居住和迁徙自由。这是因为宪法所规定的自由，是有领导的自由，不是无政府状态；是广大人民的自由，不是少数人的个人绝对自由。如果允许少数人有个人绝对自由，允许少数人有只顾自己、不顾国家和集体利益的盲目流动迁徙自由，那么，就必然会使得国家统筹安排的方针和社会主义建设的计划不能顺利执行，必然会使得广大人民的工作、学习和生活的正常秩序受到损害，其结果必然是妨碍广大人民的自由，也当然会妨碍公民的居住和迁徙的自由。因此，限制少数人这种不合理的盲目流动迁徙“自由”，正是为了保护多数人正当的居住和迁徙自由。而且还应该看到，对于这些少数人来说，也仅仅是限制他们这种盲目流动迁徙的不合理行为，对于他们正当的居住和迁徙自由，我们是丝毫也不加以限制的。比如居住农村的公民，只要他们持有城市劳动部门或学校发给的录用、录取证明，或者城市户口登记机关准予迁入的证明，完全可以迁往城市，不会受到任何限制。同时，对于这些少数人来说，限制他们这种盲目流动迁徙的不合理行为，正是对他们自己有利的。如果纵容他们脱离国家统筹安排，违反广大人民的集体利益，盲目流动迁徙，那就对国家、人民不利，对他们自己也不利。因为只有国家发展了，他们自己才能发展；大家过好日子了，他们自己才能过好日子。试想，一个人如果脱离了国家的安排，违反了集体的利益，自己个人的政治权利和经济利益，怎么能够得到真正的保障呢？
    由此可见，条例草案中某些带有约束性的规定，同宪法规定的“中华人民共和国公民有居住和迁徙的自由”，是完全一致的。我们相信，广大人民根据自己在政治生活和社会生活中的切身体验，是懂得这个道理的，因而也是会拥护这些措施的。
    四、怎样执行这个条例？
    户口登记条例同每个人都有密切关系，必须依靠大家的自觉，才能贯彻执行。现在广大群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，已经空前提高，大多数群众已经养成了遵守户口制度的习惯。但是还有少数人，没有遵守或者没有很好遵守这个制度，其中有的是由于不了解这个制度的内容和意义，有的是由于自私自利和懒惰。另外，也还有一些反革命分子和其他坏分子，故意破坏这个制度。因此，在贯彻执行这个条例的时候，必须采取依靠多数、督促少数、防范坏人的方针。应当在人民群众中充分地做好宣传教育工作，使户口登记工作的意义和各种制度，家喻户晓，人人明白。户口登记机关和户口登记工作人员，在工作中应当联系群众，依靠群众，便利群众，并帮助他们解决困难，勤勤恳恳地为群众服务。对于违反户口制度的人的处理，主要还是采取说服教育的办法，只是对于那些构成了违反治安管理行为的人，才给以适当的处罚，而处罚的目的，也还是为了教育。对于反革命分子和其他坏分子破坏户口制度，进行犯罪活动，必须依法惩办。我们相信，只要坚决地依靠群众，取得广大群众的支持，这个新的户口登记条例，一定能够很好地贯彻执行。
