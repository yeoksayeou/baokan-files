    How to Leap Forward?
    Jing Yu
    The agricultural production front is actively preparing for the Great Leap Forward. Should industrial production also leap forward, and how? Many factories and enterprises have encountered this question when discussing their 1958 production plans. The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory and the Tianjin Steel Plant have both given affirmative answers to this question.
    Industrial production must also leap forward. This is the objective requirement of the current situation. The agricultural Great Leap Forward requires industrial production to quickly keep up. The new situation and tasks of national construction also require industrial production to advance more, faster, better, and more economically. What attitude should be adopted under this situation? One is to recognize the situation, spur the horse on, catch up, and be a promoter, promoting the development of the cause. The other is to be passively skeptical and wait and see regarding the current situation, walking like a bound-foot woman, staggering and hesitating to move forward, being a deterrent, willingly falling behind the situation.
    The leading personnel of enterprises should be promoters, with cool heads and sharp eyes, seeing both the difficult side and the favorable side. The negative and difficult aspects also contain positive and favorable factors. As long as the masses are mobilized and ideological debates are conducted between the advanced and the conservative, all positive and favorable factors can be mobilized, and the original difficulties can be transformed into the driving force to overcome difficulties. The fact that the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory and the Tianjin Steel Plant overturned conservative plans and set advanced targets is an example. When the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory was discussing its 1958 production plan, it increased locomotive production from 97 units in 1957 to 150 units. Some people also excessively considered the difficult side, thinking that the production arrangements were too tight to be completed. They thought it would be better to set the plan at 140 units and use 150 units as a target to strive for, so that it would be both stable and flexible. The Party Committee rejected this proposal. At first glance, their plan seems to make some sense, but a careful study will reveal that it is actually a passive and conservative plan. In the past, some enterprises, under the pretext of stability, often left a large safety coefficient as a guarantee for obtaining excess profits. Some enterprises also set their planned targets very low, and the production summary exceeded the original plan many times. In either case, the original plan lost its guiding role.
    Currently, can industrial production leap forward, and dare we leap forward? The key lies in whether the leading personnel of the enterprise have the idea of promoting, and whether they fully mobilize the masses and inspire revolutionary zeal when formulating the 1958 production plan, setting the production plan on an advanced basis. We know that the plan is the direction of action, and an advanced plan is a prerequisite for organizing a Great Leap Forward in production. Without an advanced plan, there will be no action for a Great Leap Forward in production. Of course, if the plan is set more advanced and the targets are set tighter, it may bring some tension. This tension is not a bad thing, but a good thing, because the advanced plan itself is an inspiring and organizational force. It inspires the masses to head in one direction. There are many promoters among the masses, such as advanced producers, labor models, and activists, who all belong to this faction. When factories and enterprises discuss the plan, they should fully mobilize them to lead the masses in in-depth discussions, and after the plan is determined, mobilize them to lead the masses to implement it. Then, the country's plan will quickly become the actions of millions of people.
    Mobilizing the masses, mobilizing all positive factors, formulating advanced plans, and promoting a new upsurge in industrial production, so that industrial production can also have a leap forward, this is the responsibility of the leaders of all industrial production enterprises today.

    怎样跃进？
    静宇
    农业生产战线正在积极准备大跃进，工业生产要不要跃进，如何跃进？许多工厂企业在讨论1958年生产计划时碰到了这个问题。大连机车车辆厂和天津钢厂对这个问题都作了肯定的答复。
    工业生产也要跃进，这是目前的客观要求。农业大跃进的形势，要求工业生产很快地跟上去；国家建设的新形势和新任务，也要求工业生产更多更快更好更省地前进。在这种形势下应当采取什么态度呢？一种是认清形势，快马加鞭，迎头赶上，做个促进派，促进事业的发展。另一种是对当前形势，消极怀疑，等待观望，像小脚女人走路，摇摇摆摆，欲步不前，做一个促退派，甘愿落在形势的后面。
    企业的领导人员应当做个促进派，头脑冷静，目光四射，既看到困难的一面，也看到有利的一面，消极困难的方面也包含有积极有利的因素，只要发动群众，通过先进同保守的思想辩论，就可以调动一切积极有利因素，原来困难的东西就可转化为克服困难的动力，大连机车车辆厂和天津钢厂推翻了保守计划，订出了先进指标的事实，就是例证。大连机车车辆厂在讨论1958年生产计划的时候，把机车产量由1957年的九十七台提高到一百五十台，也有人过多地考虑困难的一面，认为生产安排太紧，不好完成。他们认为不如把计划订为一百四十台，而把一百五十台作为争取达到的目标，这样，既稳妥而又灵活，党委会否定了这个主张。粗看起来，他们的打算好像也有一些道理，仔细研究一下，就会看出其实是个消极保守的计划。过去，有些企业在稳妥的借口下，常常留了很大的保险系数，作为取得超额利润的保证；也有一些企业的计划指标订得很低，生产总结超过原定计划许多倍。无论那种情况，都使原有计划失去了指导作用。
    当前，工业生产上能不能跃进，敢不敢跃进？关键在于企业的领导人员有没有促进的思想，在制订1958年生产计划的时候，是不是充分发动群众，鼓起革命干劲，把生产计划制订在先进的基础上。我们知道，计划是行动的方向，先进的计划是组织生产大跃进的先决条件，没有先进的计划就没有生产大跃进的行动。当然，计划订得先进一些，指标卡得紧一点，可能会带来一些紧张，这种紧张，并不是坏事，而是好事。因为先进计划的本身就是一支鼓舞力量和组织力量。它鼓舞着群众奔赴一个方向。群众当中有很多促进派，如先进生产者、劳动模范和积极分子等都是属于这一派。工厂企业在讨论计划的时候，充分发动他们去带领群众深入讨论，并在计划确定以后，动员他们带动群众付诸实施。那么，国家的计划就会很快成为千百万群众的行动。
    发动群众，调动一切积极因素，订出先进的计划，促进工业生产的新高潮，使工业生产也来一个跃进，这是当前一切工业生产企业领导者的责任。
