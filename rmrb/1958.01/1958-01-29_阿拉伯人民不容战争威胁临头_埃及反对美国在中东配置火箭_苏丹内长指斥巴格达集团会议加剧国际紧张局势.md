Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 28th: According to "Al-Masaa" newspaper, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry informed the U.S. Ambassador to Cairo, Hare, on the 27th that Egypt opposes the establishment of atomic weapons bases and rocket bases in the Middle East.

The Assistant Undersecretary of the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, Fahmy, received the diplomatic envoys of fourteen Asian and Arab countries stationed in Egypt on the 26th, explaining Egypt's attitude towards the Baghdad Pact's Ankara meeting and illustrating the seriousness of establishing rocket bases in the Middle East.

These fourteen countries are: Indonesia, Afghanistan, Ceylon, India, Burma, Syria, Iraq, Tunisia, Libya, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Lebanon, and Yemen.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th: TASS Cairo, 28th: According to the Middle East News Agency, Sudanese Interior Minister Rahman said on the 27th that the Ankara meeting of the Baghdad Pact Council will not only fail to ease international tension but will intensify it. Rahman pointed out that the establishment of atomic bases and rocket bases on the territory of some countries in the Middle East would expose the entire Middle East region, especially Sudan, to the danger of war.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th: TASS Cairo, 26th: Egyptian newspapers have all criticized the Ankara meeting of the Baghdad Pact Council. Some newspapers focused on condemning the U.S. conspiracy to establish rocket weapon bases in the Baghdad Pact countries.

"Al-Masaa" pointed out that the imperialist schemes in the Near East have encountered resistance from the Arab peoples' growing national consciousness, and the Arab peoples have strengthened their unity in the struggle for freedom and independence. Another important factor is the growing strength of the peace camp led by the Soviet Union, which has surpassed the United States.

The newspaper wrote: "The people of the Arab East now know that the unity of the peace-loving people of all countries is a force that can stop aggression or prevent the threat of aggression. The failure of the attempt to intimidate Syria with aggression not long ago is an example of this. In addition, Syria and Egypt have also signed agreements with the Soviet Union on establishing industries in these countries that can improve living standards, thus successfully overcoming the Western economic blockade." The cooperation between free Arab countries and the world's peace-loving forces has dealt a fatal blow to the U.S. imperialist policy in the Near East.

"Al-Masaa" continued: "In this situation, Dulles put forward a new proposal to strengthen the Baghdad Pact by establishing rocket weapon bases on the territory of the Baghdad Pact member states, which puts the entire region under the threat of destruction and annihilation."

"Al-Masaa" called on Arab countries to "strengthen unity in the struggle to abolish aggressive military treaties, oppose the establishment of atomic bases, and oppose war."

    阿拉伯人民不容战争威胁临头
    埃及反对美国在中东配置火箭
    苏丹内长指斥巴格达集团会议加剧国际紧张局势
    新华社开罗28日电　据“晚报”报道，埃及外交部27日通知美国驻开罗大使赫尔说，埃及反对在中东建立原子武器基地和火箭基地。
    埃及外交部助理次长法米在26日接见了十四个亚洲和阿拉伯国家驻埃及的外交使节，向他们表明了埃及对巴格达条约安卡拉会议的态度，并且说明了在中东建立火箭基地的严重性。
    这十四个国家是：印度尼西亚、阿富汗、锡兰、印度、缅甸、叙利亚、伊拉克、突尼斯、利比亚、摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、黎巴嫩和也门。
    新华社28日讯　塔斯社开罗28日讯：据中东通讯社报道，苏丹内政部长拉赫曼27日说，巴格达条约理事会安卡拉会议不仅不能缓和、反而会加剧国际紧张局势。拉赫曼指出，在中东一些国家的领土上建立原子基地和火箭基地，将使中东整个地区，特别是苏丹，遭受战争的危险。
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社开罗26日讯：埃及各报都抨击巴格达条约理事会安卡拉会议。有的报纸着重谴责美国力图在巴格达条约国家建立火箭武器基地的阴谋。
    “晚报”指出，帝国主义在近东的阴谋诡计遇到了阿拉伯各国人民日益增长的民族自觉的抵制，阿拉伯各国人民在争取自由和独立的斗争中加强了自己的团结。另一个重要的情况是，以苏联为首的和平阵营的力量日益强大，苏联已经超过了美国。
    报纸写道：“阿拉伯东方的人民现在知道，各国爱好和平的人民的团结是一种能够制止侵略或者防止侵略威胁的力量。不久以前用侵略恐吓叙利亚的企图的失败就是这方面的例证。此外，叙利亚和埃及还同苏联签订了关于在这些国家中建立能够提高生活水平的工业的协定，因而成功地战胜了西方的经济封锁。”自由的阿拉伯国家和世界上爱好和平的力量的合作给予美国在近东的帝国主义政策以致命的打击。
    “晚报”继续写道：“在这种情况下，杜勒斯提出了通过在巴格达条约成员国领土上建立火箭武器基地的方法来加强巴格达条约的新建议，这就使整个这个地区处于破坏和毁灭的威胁之下。”
    “晚报”呼吁阿拉伯国家“在争取取消侵略性的军事条约、反对建立原子基地和反对战争的斗争中加强团结”。
