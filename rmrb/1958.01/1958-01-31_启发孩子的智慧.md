　　Fangfang grew up in the city and, at six or seven years old, had never seen crops. She simply didn't know where grain came from. Once, her parents took her to the countryside to visit relatives. When she saw bean pods, she exclaimed in surprise, "So soybeans grow here? I thought they grew on big trees!" This sentence made the rural relatives laugh until their stomachs hurt. Actually, Fangfang was a very clever and bright child, but she made this joke. "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times," and guiding children to see more is a necessary way to inspire their wisdom.

　　Mental arithmetic is very helpful for developing children's thinking abilities. For preschool children, they should be required to learn to read sequentially from one to one hundred according to their different age characteristics. Three- and four-year-olds can start by calculating from one to ten, and then increase to twenty. Simple addition and subtraction within ten should also be practiced from the age of five or six. When teaching children mental arithmetic, use various things in daily life flexibly to inspire them. For example, you can often ask questions like: "Yingying, how many hands do you have?" "Count how many fingers you have?" "You have two hands, plus your younger brother and sister's hands, how many are there in total?" In this way, children will be happy to answer. In answering, they are given a kind of training imperceptibly, and their wisdom is cultivated.

　　Memory is also an effective way to cultivate children's wisdom. The more things children see, and the more they remember, the more it helps to inspire their wisdom. Dongdong's parents took her to visit the agricultural production cooperative and walked through the cellar where cabbage was stored. Dongdong was fascinated by the mountains of cabbage. The child asked many questions, and the adults told her everything. After returning home, Dongdong's father asked her: "What did you see at the agricultural cooperative?" "Lots of cabbage!" "Where was it kept?" "In the cellar!" "Why was it kept in the cellar?" "It's warm in the cellar, so it won't freeze and rot." "What were the farmers doing there?" "Turning the cabbage and tearing off the leaves." "Why tear off the rotten leaves?" "If you don't tear them off, they will all rot."... Memory trains children's thinking skills, accumulates knowledge, and develops their wisdom.

　　Asking different questions according to different age characteristics can further cultivate children's wisdom. An early childhood educator asked children who already had a preliminary concept of "units": "Which is heavier, cotton or iron?" After the children answered correctly, they were then asked: "Which is heavier, a pound of cotton or a pound of iron?" This kind of question that easily confuses the boundaries of right and wrong is the most sensitive measuring device for examining whether children understand the question deeply or not.

　　Telling children stories that are easy to understand according to their age characteristics is also the key to opening the door to children's wisdom. There are many children's stories in Chinese history that can inspire children's wisdom. The story of "Wang Rong predicting bitter plums" reflects the intelligence and resourcefulness of a seven-year-old child. A group of children saw many fruits growing on a plum tree by the roadside, and everyone rushed to pick them, but only Wang Rong did not move. He said: "The tree is by the roadside and has many fruits, these must be bitter plums." The facts completely confirmed his prediction. This is because he found the dialectical relationship between the tree's location (by the roadside), the current situation (many fruits), and the taste of the fruit (bitter). Explaining this method of analysis clearly to children will cultivate their correct way of thinking.

　　Reproaching and despising children in public, or mocking them for being low-ability, is very detrimental to inspiring their wisdom. Some parents intentionally or unintentionally laugh at their children in front of them: "You are such a fool!" These words are like a basin of cold water, extinguishing the sparks of children's wisdom.

    启发孩子的智慧
    王威宣
    芳芳生长在城市里，六、七岁了，从来没有见过庄稼。她简直不知道粮食是从那里来的。有一回父母带她到乡下去走亲戚。她看见豆荚时，大惊小怪地叫起来：“大豆怎么是长在这个地方？不是长在大树上吗！？”这句话逗得乡下的亲戚连肚子也笑痛了。本来，芳芳是一个非常聪明伶俐的孩子，却闹出了这个笑话。“百闻不如一见”，引导孩子们多看，这是启发孩子们的智慧的必要途径。
    口算对于发展孩子的思考能力是有很大帮助的。对于学前儿童，应该根据不同的年龄特征要求他们学会从一到一百的顺序读法。三、四岁的孩子可以先算一至十，然后增至二十。十位以内的简单加法和减法也应该在五、六岁的时候开始练习。在教育孩子学习口算的时候，要灵活地运用日常生活中的各种事物去启发他们。例如：可以经常这样发问：“英英，你有几只手？”“算一算，你有几个手指？”“你有两只手，加上弟弟和妹妹的手一共有几只？”这样，孩子们都会乐意回答。在回答中无形中给他们一种训练，培养了孩子们的智慧。
    记忆也是培养孩子智慧的有效方法。孩子们看见的事物越多，记忆的越多，对于启发他们的智慧帮助也就越大。冬冬的父母亲领她到农业生产合作社参观，在收藏白菜的地窖里走了一趟。冬冬被堆积如山的白菜吸引住了。孩子问了许多问题，大人都一一告诉她了。回家之后，冬冬的爸爸便问她：“你在农业社看见了什么？”“好多白菜！”“放在哪儿？”“地窖里！”“为什么要放在地窖里？”“地窖里暖和，不会冻烂。”“农民伯伯在那里干什么？”“翻菜，撕菜叶。”“为什么要把烂菜叶撕下？”“不撕下就会统统烂掉。”……。记忆，训练了孩子的思考力，同时也积累了知识，发展了他的智慧。
    根据不同的年龄特征，提出不同的问题，可以进一步培养孩子的智慧。有一位儿童教育工作者对已经有初步“单位”概念的孩子问：“棉花重呢，还是铁片重呢？”孩子们正确地回答之后，接着再问：“一斤棉花重呢，还是一斤铁片重呢？”这种容易混淆是非界线的问题，便是考察儿童对问题理解得深透与否的最灵敏的测量器。
    根据年龄的特征，讲孩子容易理解的故事，也是开启儿童智慧之门的钥匙。我国历史上有过许许多多儿童故事，都能启发儿童的智慧。“王戎预知李苦”的佳话，反映了七岁孩子的聪颖多智。一群小孩看见路边李树结了许多果实，大家都争先恐后地去采摘，只有王戎不动。他说：“树在道边而多子，此必苦李。”事实完全证实了他的预言。这是因为他把树的生长位置（路旁）、当时的情况（多子）和果实的味道（苦的）三者之间的辩证关系找到了。把这种分析的方法给孩子们讲明白了，就会培养他们的正确的思想方法。
    当面责怪和蔑视孩子，或讽讥他低能，这对于启发孩子的智慧是十分不利的。有的父母亲在孩子们面前有意无意地嘲笑：“你真是个大傻瓜！”这些话就像一盆冷水一样，把孩子们智慧的火苗都熄灭了。
