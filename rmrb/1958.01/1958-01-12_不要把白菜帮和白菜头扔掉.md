Don't Throw Away Cabbage Leaves and Cabbage Heads
Jiang Younong
　　Chinese cabbage is the most common vegetable for people in the north during the winter. However, when eating Chinese cabbage, some people always break off some of the cabbage leaves and cut off the cabbage head because they think the leaves are too old or too dirty. In the countryside, these removed cabbage leaves and heads can be used to feed pigs; in the cities, they can only be thrown into the trash can as waste. This is a waste. Not long ago, the State Council issued an instruction on doing a good job in the supply of vegetables this winter and next spring, which pointed out that eating only the heart of the cabbage and peeling the skin off radishes and potatoes wastes about 15% of vegetables a year.
    According to nutritional experts, the outer leaves of vegetables contain more calcium than the inner leaves. Therefore, from a nutritional point of view, not eating cabbage leaves is a loss. As for the cabbage head, it not only has the nutritional value of ordinary vegetables, but also, according to traditional Chinese medicine, the cabbage head can cure diseases. When treating winter epidemic diseases, they always use cabbage heads as a medicinal "guide."
    Cabbage leaves and cabbage heads can also be made into many delicious dishes. For example, wash the cabbage leaves, boil them in boiling water for one minute, take them out, and cut them into small squares or thin strips. Marinate them with salt (or add a little vinegar) for a day. When eating, add a few drops of sesame oil (or chili oil), or mix in a little carrot shreds. It is not only good-looking in color, but also a fragrant and crispy side dish. We can also use cabbage leaves to make vegetable dumplings. First wash and chop the cabbage leaves, fry the dried shrimp skins in oil, and mix in some oil, green onions, ginger, yellow sauce and other seasonings. Steaming dumplings and buns are both good.
    There are also many ways to eat cabbage heads. We can wash the cabbage head, cut off the yellow part, and cook it with the cabbage leaves together with cinnamon, fennel and a small amount of salt or soy sauce. It tastes good. If there is pickled cabbage at home, you can put the cabbage head in the pickled cabbage jar to pickle and eat.
    Using cabbage leaves and cabbage heads can not only save household expenses, but also help alleviate the market's winter vegetable supply situation.

    不要把白菜帮和白菜头扔掉
    江幼农
    大白菜是北方人民冬天最常吃的蔬菜。可是，有些人家在吃大白菜的时候，因为嫌菜老，或者是嫌菜脏，总要掰下一些菜帮，还要把菜头切掉。在农村，这些去掉的菜帮和菜头，可以用来喂猪；在城市，就只好当作废物扔进垃圾箱了。这是一种浪费。不久以前国务院发布的关于做好今冬明春蔬菜供应工作的指示中就指出，因为吃白菜去帮，吃萝卜、土豆去皮，一年大约要浪费蔬菜15％左右。
    据营养学专家分析，蔬菜外部叶子所含的钙质，要比里面的叶子高。所以从营养观点来说，不吃菜帮是一种损失。至于白菜头，不但具有一般蔬菜的营养价值，而且按照中医的说法，白菜头能治病。他们在治冬瘟症的时候，总是用白菜头做药“引子”。
    白菜帮和白菜头也可做出很多可口的菜。例如把白菜帮洗净，在开水中煮一分钟，捞出，切成小方块或细丝，用盐（或者加一点醋）腌一天，吃时加几滴香油（或辣椒油），或者再拌上一点胡萝卜丝，不但颜色好看，而且是又香又脆的可口小菜。我们也可以利用白菜帮来做菜团子。先把菜帮洗净、剁碎，把虾米皮用油炸一炸，拌一些油、葱、姜、黄酱等调料，蒸团子、包子都可以。
    白菜头的吃法也很多。我们可以把白菜头洗净，切去黄色部分，和白菜帮一起用桂皮、茴香和少量的盐或酱油一起煮来吃，味道不错。如果家中做有泡菜，可以把白菜头放在泡菜坛内泡着吃。
    利用白菜帮和白菜头，既能节约家庭开支，对缓和市场冬季菜蔬供应情况也有好处。
