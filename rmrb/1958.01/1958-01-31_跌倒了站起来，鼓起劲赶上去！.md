Fall Down, Stand Up, and Strive to Catch Up!
The Dongfeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    After studying the People's Daily editorial of December 28, "Another Bumper Harvest, Another Leap Forward," we have, in a spirit of self-criticism, focused on examining the problems existing in our leadership of agricultural production. Through study and examination, we have initially realized that although we have done some work and achieved certain results in the past few years under the correct leadership of the higher-level Party committees and with the active support of the people of the county, due to our right-leaning conservatism, lack of drive, and lack of down-to-earth work style, we have done a very poor job of mobilizing the broad masses of farmers to actively overcome natural disasters, overcome difficulties, and improve production, with the result that the grain yield of the first Five-Year Plan has never reached the level of 1952. In particular, the plan was still not completed in 1957. According to preliminary calculations, out of the 163 agricultural cooperatives in the county, ten cooperatives, accounting for 6.1% of the total number of cooperatives, had a total output of less than 50%. As a Party organization at the county level, we bear a serious responsibility because we have failed to fulfill our duties to the Party and the people. Therefore, we believe that the People's Daily's criticism is serious and completely correct. We humbly accept the criticism of the People's Daily and take it as a warning, determined to summon up courage, take active action, rely on the masses to formulate plans, seize the key to increasing production, adhere to thorough implementation, break through difficulties, march towards nature, and realize a great leap forward in agriculture.
    
    Lessons to be Learned

    We have examined and found that the reason for the grain production reduction in the past few years, as the People's Daily pointed out, is due to many factors, but the fundamental problem lies in our insufficient work efforts.

    First, from an ideological point of view. Our right-leaning conservative thinking is serious, and we lack a revolutionary spirit of promotion. In the winter of 1956 and the first half of 1957, we were blinded by a small typhoon and lost our heads. We have not broken free from the influence of habitual forces, and our thinking lags behind reality. For example, in 1953, the county promoted 135 sets of horse-drawn farm implements and promoted the Zaoyuan high-yield experience. In 1956, the county promoted large-scale double-seedling planting of corn in each furrow and mobilized the masses to build water conservancy projects and dig wells. Some of these efforts resulted in failures, but some yielded valuable successful experiences. We failed to seriously summarize these experiences and lessons, educate the masses to distinguish between right and wrong, and promote them again. We even failed to promote or promoted less those things that had already proven effective and should have continued to be promoted. It was this right-leaning conservative thinking that caused losses to agricultural production in 1957. In 1957, due to the poor quality of some water conservancy projects and the lack of water sources due to the spring drought, coupled with a northwest wind in August, the rice yield was affected. But the main reason was that our work could not keep up, which resulted in the abandonment of some paddy fields, and the planting of soybeans was also delayed. However, we lacked a comprehensive analysis of this and were very conservative when formulating the 1958 plan to convert paddy fields last autumn. The first draft only proposed a conservative plan to convert 1,200 hectares. After studying the instructions of the Provincial and Prefectural Party Committees and launching a production upsurge, the plan was revised several times and increased to 4,800 hectares. We have also been insufficient in humbly studying and absorbing experiences from other places.

    Second, we lack a long-term, specific, and comprehensive plan for the development of agricultural production. Although a plan to achieve the agricultural program was formulated in the winter of 1956, its content was empty, and the achievement of the program's targets was considered a long-term matter, lacking concrete practical action. For example, as early as 1956, the county's draft twelve-year plan proposed to strive to expand paddy fields to 20,000 hectares by 1958. However, in practice, there was insufficient research on whether this plan was high or low and how to strive to achieve it. Therefore, when we began to formulate the 1958 plan to expand the area of paddy fields last autumn, we stood still.

    Third, our failure to seize the key to increasing production in agricultural production is also a major reason for the reduction in production. Our county is a semi-mountainous area with dense ditches and streams and undulating hills, with excellent conditions for expanding the area of paddy fields. However, in 1957, we did not grasp this key link. Water conservancy construction was done very poorly, and we neglected soil and water conservation and the control of waterlogging. In the county as a whole, about 35,000 hectares have suffered severe soil erosion in recent years, accounting for 13.4% of the total area of the county, and 9,000 hectares are waterlogged, accounting for 9% of the cultivated land area. The failure to complete the pig production plan has also greatly affected the increase in fertilizer. The phenomenon of thin and dead draught animals is also relatively serious. In 1957, each draught animal was responsible for an average of 3.29 hectares of cultivated land, resulting in rough farming.

    Fourth, the work of rectifying the Party and the communes has not been done well enough. The operation and management of some agricultural cooperatives are relatively chaotic, and the phenomenon of wasted work is serious. In particular, the "three guarantees" system has not been well implemented. There are also problems in the implementation of the Party's class policy in the countryside. According to incomplete statistics, there are 230 production team leaders who are well-to-do middle peasants, accounting for about 17% of the production teams in the county. There are still 23 weak Party branches in the countryside, which are not playing the role of a fighting fortress.

    Fifth, our work style is one of general leadership. Although we often go up and down, we have done a very poor job of cultivating typical examples, setting up models, and providing specific guidance. We have not seriously promoted advanced production experiences in conjunction with summarizing local production experiences. Most of the members of the county Party committee are trapped in office work, and few go down to the grassroots level.

    We Have Confidence in Striving for a Great Leap Forward in Agriculture

    In order to achieve the targets of the Agricultural Development Program, the comrades of the County Party Committee unanimously expressed their determination to work hard for ten years and strive to achieve a great leap forward in agriculture. We will do our best to achieve the goals of the Program ahead of schedule in 1964—a yield of 400 jin per mu, and a yield of 500 jin per mu by 1967. To this end, we feel that we must first strive to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1958.

    It is entirely possible to strive to achieve the agricultural production plan for 1958 and strive for a bumper harvest. First of all, the great call of the Party Central Committee and the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Development Program are inspiring us; secondly, through the great debate and the rectification of the Party and the communes in the countryside, the socialist awareness of the peasants has been further enhanced, the experience of the broad masses of peasants and cadres has increased, the agricultural cooperatives have been increasingly consolidated, the combat effectiveness of the Party branches has been strengthened, and the agricultural cooperatives have laid a solid material foundation for normal development of production; thirdly, the rectification movement can greatly overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking of our leaders at all levels and thoroughly change our work style. Although the tasks are heavy this winter and spring, and some of the spring plowing materials (seeds, fodder, etc.) in some disaster-stricken communes are not yet fully prepared, these are not difficult to solve. The current measures to be taken are:

    1. In the whole county range, make examination of agricultural production problems an important component of the rectification movement. All departments should also conduct inspections from the perspective of how to serve production, earnestly summarize advanced experience in increasing production, and overcome right-leaning conservative thinking. It is necessary to do a good job of investigation and research, clarify the situation, establish confidence in conquering and transforming nature, criticize and overcome complacency, humbly learn from the experience of other places, organize visits, and broaden horizons.

    2. Organize forces from all aspects to do a good job of comprehensive and overall planning, especially the 1958 production plan. In connection with the rural rectification movement, earnestly mobilize the masses to speak out freely, and, in combination with the actual conditions of the county, township, and commune, discuss the National Agricultural Development Program and the province's twelve-year agricultural production plan, and formulate a comprehensive plan for agricultural production in the next ten years from bottom to top. On this basis, clarify the production level of local well-to-do middle peasants and propose a plan to catch up with or exceed the production and income levels of local well-to-do middle peasants within three to five years. Under this general requirement, accurately propose the 1958 production plan.

    3. Firmly grasp the key to increasing production. First of all, comprehensively do a good job of water conservancy construction. The county currently has 9,300 hectares of paddy fields, and the target for 1958 is to reach 14,000 hectares. Mobilize the masses to launch a construction upsurge to do a good job of soil and water conservation and control of waterlogging, and strive to comprehensively do a good job of soil and water conservation in 20% of the communes, completing soil and water conservation work on an area of 100 square kilometers and draining waterlogging on 2,000 hectares. Secondly, grasp the leadership of the fertilizer accumulation movement. Our county now has an average of 23 cartloads of fertilizer per hectare (1,000 jin per cartload), and we strive to reach 40 cartloads per hectare. Vigorously improve the quality of manure fertilizer, actively raise pigs, and strive to reach 65,000 pigs by the end of the year, an average of 1.23 pigs per household. Third, vigorously develop animal husbandry and gradually solve the problem of insufficient animal power. Fourth, conscientiously grasp the original advanced experience in increasing production.

    4. Do a good job of rectifying the Party and the communes, conscientiously implement the Party's class policy in the countryside, improve the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives, and implement the policy of running communes democratically and frugally. At the same time, adjust the production teams in a planned way to facilitate the implementation of the "three guarantees" system. In conjunction with the rectification of the communes, do a good job of the rural Party rectification work to enhance the combat effectiveness of rural Party branches.

    5. Strive to learn the working method of following the mass line, and, through the rectification movement, resolutely do a good job of streamlining the organization, transferring cadres to lower levels, and enriching and improving the work. After discussion by the County Party Committee, a preliminary plan is to transfer about 100 leading cadres to the grassroots level to lead agricultural production and 750 to participate directly in production in agricultural cooperatives. In order to gain experience in increasing production in all aspects and provide specific guidance to this year's great production, the County Party Committee has decided that four of the six current members of the Standing Committee will live in the countryside for a long time. Leading cadres at all levels should go deep into the production process and actually participate in production labor. In addition to the comrades of the County Party Committee having to personally cultivate an experimental plot, each county and township cadre is also required to cultivate an experimental plot, and pay attention to studying and summarizing the experience of old farmers, overcome the conservative thinking of sticking to old ways, and improve the level of production knowledge. We are determined to summon up revolutionary vigor, use the spirit of rather enduring ten years of hardship to exchange for ten thousand years of happiness and falling down and getting up, work hard and struggle hard, think of every possible way to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production.

    跌倒了站起来，鼓起劲赶上去！中共东丰县委员会
    我们学习了人民日报12月28日“丰收再丰收，跃进再跃进”的社论，以自我批评精神着重检查了我们在领导农业生产方面存在的问题。经过学习和检查，初步认识到几年来虽在上级党的正确领导下和全县人民积极支持作了些工作，获得了一定成绩。但由于我们的思想右倾保守，干劲不足，工作作风不踏实，对发动广大农民积极战胜自然灾害、克服困难搞好生产作的很差，致使第一个五年计划的粮食产量一直没有达到1952年的水平。特别是1957年仍然没有完成计划。全县一百六十三个农业社，初步结算，总产量不到五成的即有十个社，占总社数6.1％。作为一级党的组织来讲，我们负有严重的责任，因为对党和人民没有尽到职责。因此，我们认为人民日报的批评是严肃的、完全正确的。我们虚心接受人民日报的批评，并以此为戒，决心鼓足勇气，积极行动起来，依靠群众制定规划，抓住增产关键，坚持贯彻到底，冲破困难，向大自然进军，实现农业大跃进。
    应当吸取的教训
    我们检查，几年来所以造成粮食减产，正像人民日报指出的，原因是多方面的，但根本问题还是在于我们的工作努力不够。
    第一、从思想上检查。我们的右倾保守思想是严重的，缺乏革命的促进精神。1956年冬季和1957年上半年，我们曾被一股小台风刮迷了眼睛，弄昏了头脑。我们没有摆脱习惯势力的影响，思想落后于实际。如1953年全县推广一百三十五套马拉农具和推广肇源丰产经验，1956年推广大面积一垵双棵玉米，以及发动群众兴修水利打井等，有些失败教训，但也有些值得重视的成功经验。我们未能认真总结这些经验和教训，教育群众分清是非，再行推广，甚至对有些已有成效本应继续推行的事也不推行或少推行了。正是这种右倾保守思想，就给1957年农业生产带来了损失。1957年由于部分水利工程质量不好，加之春旱水源不足，8月刮一场西北风，对水稻减产是有影响的，但主要是工作跟不上去，致使有些水田荒芜，改播大豆也耽误了农时。可是我们对此缺乏全面分析，去秋制定1958年改水田计划时就很保守。第一次仅提出改一千二百垧的保守计划。经学习省委地委指示和生产高潮发动起来之后，才几次修改了计划，提高到四千八百垧。我们虚心研究吸取外地经验也很不够。
    第二、对发展农业生产缺乏长远的、具体的全面规划。1956年冬虽然制定了一个实现农业纲要的计划，但内容空洞，对实现纲要指标认为是长远的事，缺乏具体的实际行动。如早在1956年县的十二年规划草案中已提出争取1958年扩大水田到二万垧。但在实践中对这个计划是高是低、怎样争取努力实现研究不够，所以去秋开始制定1958年扩大水田面积计划时，就踏步不前。
    第三、我们在农业生产中抓增产关键不够，也是减产的主要原因。我们县是沟溪密布、丘陵起伏的半山区，有大量扩大水田的优越条件。但是1957年我们没有抓住这个主要环节。水利建设工作做的很差，忽视水土保持和治理内涝。全县几年来水土流失严重的约有三万五千垧，占全县总面积的13.4％，内涝的九千垧，占耕地面积的9％。生猪生产没有完成计划，也大大影响了肥料的增加。耕畜瘦弱死亡现象也较严重，1957年每头耕畜平均负担耕地三点二九垧，耕作粗放。
    第四、整党整社工作做得不够，有些农业社经营管理比较混乱，窝工现象严重。特别是三包制度执行的不好。在贯彻执行党在农村的阶级政策方面也存在问题。据不完全统计，富裕中农担任生产队长的就有二百三十个队，占全县生产队的17％左右。农村中仍有二十三个薄弱支部，起不到战斗堡垒作用。
    第五、我们的工作作风是一般化领导，虽然经常上来下去，但培养典型、树立样子、具体指导做得很差。对先进生产经验没有同总结当地生产经验结合起来认真加以推广。县委委员多数陷于机关工作，下乡到基层的很少。
    有信心争取农业大跃进
    为了实现农业发展纲要指标，县委的同志一致表示决心，立志苦战十年，为实现农业大跃进而奋斗。我们将全力争取在1964年提前实现纲要指标——亩产四百斤，到1967年亩产五百斤。为此，我们感到必须首先争取实现1958年的农业大丰收。
    努力实现1958年的农业生产计划，争取大丰收是完全可能的。首先，是党中央的伟大号召和农业发展纲要四十条鼓舞着我们；其次，农村经过大辩论和整党整社，农民社会主义觉悟进一步提高，广大农民和干部的经验增加了，农业社日益巩固，党支部战斗力增强，农业社已经打下了正常发展生产的物质基础；再次，经过整风运动可以大大克服我们各级领导的右倾保守思想和彻底转变工作作风。虽然去冬今春工作任务繁重，还有部分受灾社的春耕物资（种子、草料等）准备得还不够。但是这些是不难解决的。目前决定采取的措施是：
    一、在全县范围内把检查农业生产问题列为整风的重要内容。各部门也要从如何为生产服务进行检查，认真总结先进增产经验，克服右倾保守思想。要作好调查研究，弄清情况，树立征服改造自然的信心，批判和克服骄傲自满情绪，虚心学习外地经验，组织参观，扩大眼界。
    二、组织各方面的力量搞好综合的全面规划，特别是搞好1958年生产规划。结合农村整风，认真发动群众鸣放，结合本县、本乡、本社实际情况，讨论全国农业发展纲要，和省的十二年农业生产规划，由下而上制定出今后十年农业生产的全面规划。在这个基础上搞清当地富裕中农的生产水平，提出三至五年内赶上或超过当地富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平的规划。在这个总的要求下，确切地提出1958年的生产规划。
    三、狠狠地抓住增产关键。首先全面搞好水利建设。全县现有水田面积九千三百垧，1958年要达到一万四千垧。发动群众掀起一个搞好水土保持、治理内涝的施工高潮，争取在20％的社中全面搞好水土保持工作，完成水土保持面积一百平方公里，排出内涝二千垧。其次，抓紧积肥运动的领导。我县现在平均每垧有肥二十三车（每车一千斤），争取每垧达到四十车。大力提高粪肥质量，积极养猪，争取年底达到六万五千头，平均每户一点二三头。第三，大力发展畜牧业，逐步解决畜力不足的困难。第四，认真抓住原有的先进增产经验。
    四、作好整党整社工作，认真贯彻党在农村中的阶级政策，改善农业社经营管理，贯彻执行民主办社和勤俭办社的方针。同时有计划地把生产队加以调整，以利于三包制的贯彻执行。在整社同时结合作好农村整党工作，提高农村党支部的战斗力。
    五、努力学习走群众路线的工作方法，通过整风坚决搞好紧缩机构，下放干部，充实改进工作。经过县委讨论初步计划下放到基层做农业生产的领导骨干的约一百名，直接到农业社中参加生产的七百五十名。县委为了取得各方面的增产经验，具体指导好今年大生产，决定现有常委委员六名，长期住在农村四名。各级领导干部都要深入生产过程实际参加生产劳动，除了县委同志必须亲自搞一块实验田，要求每个县、乡干部也都要搞一块实验田，并注意研究总结老农经验，克服墨守陈规的保守思想，提高生产知识水平。我们决心鼓起革命干劲，用宁肯忍受十年艰苦也要换取万年幸福和跌倒爬起的精神，苦战苦斗，想尽千方百计，实现农业生产大跃进。
