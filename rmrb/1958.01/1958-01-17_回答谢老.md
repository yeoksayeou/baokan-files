Responding to Old Xie

Respected Old Xie:

We have all read your letter to the cadres sent to lower levels in the supplement of the People's Daily on New Year's Day. You truly care about us, these children. As the saying goes, "A mother worries when her child travels a thousand miles." We are participating in labor at lower levels, and you still think of us and congratulate us on New Year's Day.

How should we respond well? Let us express our gratitude to you, old man, in writing. We are determined to do as you said in your letter: "Office cadres and intellectuals are important links in this revolution. They are the ones who transform people, and first they must be transformed themselves. They are the ones who educate people, and first they must be educated themselves. It is not enough to rely solely on books, but they must be tempered through labor." These words have given us immeasurable strength, and we use them to examine ourselves at all times.

Old Xie, Happy New Year! We, these children, should also report to you how we spent New Year's Day. We bravely volunteered to participate in a crash project to dig a well that is nine mu in area and one zhang deep. We are proud of this arduous and glorious task. This is how we bid farewell to 1957 and welcomed 1958.

Old Xie: We are the first group of cadres from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Finance to go to Xishan Township to participate in labor. We, a few people, have also put together a clumsy poem to thank you for your kindness!

Cadres must be reformed,
Going down to the countryside and up to the mountains.
Sharing joys and hardships with the people,
Only then will one know the taste of sweetness, sourness, saltiness.

Jiang Bin, Tian Yingjie, Xie Lanchun

    回答谢老敬爱的谢老：
    您元旦在人民日报副刊上致下放干部的信，我们都看到了，您真关心我们这群孩子，古语云：儿行千里母担忧。我们下放参加劳动，您元旦还想着我们，给我们祝贺。
    我们怎么回答好呢？用字代言谢谢老人家吧。我们决心按您信中说的去做：机关干部和知识分子是这个革命中的重要环节，他们是改造人的，首先自己要得到改造；他们是教育人的，首先自己要受到教育。不是只靠书本子，而是必须到劳动中去锻炼。这几句话给了我们无比的力量，我们时刻用来检查自己。
    谢老，您过年好！我们这群孩子也应向老人家汇报一下我们元旦是怎样过的。我们勇敢的报名参加突击挖方圆九亩大、深一丈的水井，我们为这艰巨而光荣的任务骄傲，我们就是这样道别1957年迎接1958年的。
    谢老：我们是北京市财政局第一批下放西山乡参加劳动的。我们几个人，也凑了一首不像样的诗，以答谢您的盛意！
    干部须改造，下乡又上山。与民同甘苦，才知甜酸咸。
                                    江滨　田英杰　谢兰春
