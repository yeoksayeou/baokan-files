    According to the Agreement on Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy Between the Two Countries
    The Soviet Union Helps Poland Build a Second Reactor
    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 28th - According to the Polish Press Agency, the Polish delegation that participated in the negotiations for the Soviet-Polish agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy recently returned to Warsaw. The head of the delegation, Mr. Billig, told a Polish Press Agency reporter that the agreement on Soviet technical assistance to Poland in the peaceful use of atomic energy has now begun to be implemented. The construction of Poland's second reactor, which was agreed to be built with Soviet assistance during the negotiations, has already begun. This reactor will be used to solve problems related to the construction of Poland's first atomic power plant (which is planned to begin construction after 1960 and be completed in 1965). Some scientific research related to this atomic power plant, as well as design research related to the power plant's reactor, will also begin soon.
    Billig also said that with the assistance of Soviet experts and consultants, Poland's uranium exploration work will be greatly strengthened this year.
    Billig finally pointed out that the agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Poland is an example of a highly developed country providing assistance to another country that is not so advanced in atomic energy. Only between socialist countries can such agreements be signed.

    根据两国和平利用原子能协定
    苏联帮助波兰建第二座反应堆
    据新华社华沙28日电　据波兰通讯社报道：参加签定苏波和平利用原子能协定谈判的波兰代表团最近回到华沙。代表团团长比利格对波兰通讯社记者说，关于苏联在和平利用原子能方面给波兰以技术援助的这个协定现在已经开始执行。在谈判中曾经议定由苏联帮助建造的波兰第二座反应堆的建筑工程已经开始。这座反应堆将用来解决与修建波兰第一座原子能发电站（它计划在1960年以后开始建设，1965年建成）有关的问题。一些有关这个原子能发电站的科学研究工作以及同发电站的反应堆有关的设计研究工作不久也将开始。
    比利格还说，在苏联专家和顾问的协助下，波兰今年的铀矿勘探工作将大大加强。
    比利格最后指出，苏联同波兰签订的这个协定是一个高度发达的国家对另一个在原子能方面不那末先进的国家提供援助的一个范例。只有在社会主义国家之间才能签定这种协定。
