Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th Dispatch: American newspapers have recently published a large number of articles commenting on the American economy, expressing concern about the US economic outlook for this year. These articles list many representative facts reflecting the continuing worsening of the US economic recession.

These are some of the facts mentioned in the articles: the operating rate of the steel industry has now fallen to less than 60%. According to "New York Times" commentator, Marlen, "Now, there is less smoke over Pittsburgh, Chicago, Youngstown, and other steel centers than before. Many steel furnaces are idle, and they can provide the country with 40% of the total steel production here. These steel furnaces have been shut down due to reduced demand." According to existing materials, the output of steel ingots this week is about 1.5 million tons, while it was 2.5 million tons in the same week last year.

McDonald, president of the United Steelworkers of America, said on the 6th that 125,000 of his union's metallurgical workers are completely unemployed, and another 200,000 metallurgical workers are partially unemployed.

The "New York Herald Tribune" pointed out that the auto industry also "encountered difficulties" in the last few months of 1957. Production in this industrial sector has fallen sharply. Automobile companies such as "Ford," "Chrysler," and "General Motors" have laid off thousands of workers from their factories. Detroit newspapers say that "Chrysler" also plans to cut its production by another 20%, which will affect the jobs of another 10,000 workers.

Three large agricultural machinery manufacturing companies in Milwaukee and Chicago have also announced production cuts due to unsold products.

Coal industry's bituminous coal production in 1957 decreased by 23% compared to 1947. The "New York Times" expects coal production to continue to decline this year.

Unemployment is growing rapidly. According to the "New York Times" forecast, "the number of unemployed will reach five million by February," reaching "the highest level in the last eighteen years."

The number of small company bankruptcies is also increasing. According to "Dun & Bradstreet Statistics," 13,700 small companies went bankrupt last year, a threefold increase compared to 1947. Newspapers point out that these figures do not include the thousands of small companies that were squeezed out of business but did not go bankrupt, and the small companies that were swallowed up by large companies through "mergers."

The newspapers also listed some materials on the agricultural crisis and the reduction of farmers' actual income. From April 1956 to April 1957, another one million people were forced to leave farms.

Some articles published in the "New York Times" and the "New York World-Telegram and the Sun" reflect that monopoly capitalists hope to "stimulate" economic activity by increasing military spending, especially missile spending. In fact, according to "U.S. News & World Report," the US government has now taken measures to increase military orders (such as increasing aircraft orders for the aviation industry and missile orders for the automotive industry) and accelerate the construction of missile bases. The US government is also requesting Congress to increase military spending.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 8th Dispatch: Parisian newspapers have generally discussed the US economic recession around the New Year. These newspapers are particularly anxious about the threat that the US economic recession will bring to Western countries.

The financial newspaper "Les Echos" believes that due to the insufficient operation of US industries, the amount of foreign raw materials purchased will also decrease accordingly. Therefore, the countries that export raw materials to the United States are the first to be affected. This newspaper quoted the estimates of "less pessimistic" experts, believing that the US import trade this year will decrease by about 7% to 8%. As the recession intensifies, the stagnation of factory products and the increase in unemployed workers will cause the United States to further restrict imports, which will adversely affect the various Western European countries whose exports to the United States began to increase last year.

    美国经济衰退正在继续加剧
    炼钢工业开工率不及60％　失业人数即将增至五百万
    法报惴惴不安认为西欧将受到不利影响
    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：美国报纸最近纷纷刊登了大量的评论美国经济的文章，对今年美国经济前景表示忧虑。这些文章里列举了许多反映美国经济衰退正在继续加剧的代表性事实。
    这就是文章中谈到的一些事实：炼钢工业的开工率现在已经下降到不及60％。据“纽约时报”评论员马耳伦报道，“现在，匹兹堡、芝加哥、扬斯顿，以及其他炼钢中心上空的煤烟比以前少了。这里有许多炼钢炉在闲着，它们可以提供给国家的钢占这里全部钢产量的40％。而这些炼钢炉由于需求的减少已经熄火了”。根据现有材料，本星期钢锭的产量约为一百五十万吨，而去年同一个星期为二百五十万吨。
    美国联合钢铁工人工会主席麦克唐纳6日说，现在有十二万五千个属于他的工会的冶金工人完全没有工作，另外有二十万冶金工人是部分失业。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”指出，汽车工业在1957年最后几个月也“遭到了困难”。这个工业部门的生产急剧下降了。“福特”、“克莱斯勒”和“通用”等汽车公司已经从它们的工厂中解雇了数以千计的工人。底特律的报纸说，“克莱斯勒”公司还打算把它的生产再削减20％，这将影响到另外一万个工人的工作。
    在密尔窝基和芝加哥的三家大农业机器制造公司也由于产品销不出去，宣布要削减生产。
    煤炭工业1957年的烟煤产量比1947年减少了23％。“纽约时报”预料今年的煤产量还会继续下降。
    失业在迅速增长。据“纽约时报”预测，“失业的人数到2月将达到五百万人”，将达到“最近十八年来的最高水平”。
    小公司破产的数量也在增加。据“邓—布列德斯特里统计所”通报，去年有一万三千七百家小公司破产，比1947年增加了三倍。报纸指出，这些数字还不包括几千家被排挤得关门但没有破产的小公司和被大公司通过“合并”的方法吞并掉的小公司。
    报纸上还列举了一些关于农业危机以及农场主实际收入减少的材料。从1956年4月到1957年4月，又有一百万人被迫离开了农场。
    “纽约时报”和“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”上刊载的一些文章反映出，垄断资本家希望用增加军费开支、特别是增加导弹开支来“刺激”经济活动。而事实上，据“美国新闻与世界报道”报道，美国政府现在已经采取了增加军事订货（例如增加航空工业的飞机订货和汽车工业的导弹订货）、加速建筑导弹基地等项措施。美国政府还正在要求国会加拨军费开支。
    据新华社巴黎8日电　新年前后的巴黎报刊普遍谈论着美国的经济衰退。这些报刊对于美国经济衰退将给西方国家带来的威胁特别感到惴惴不安。
    金融界报纸“回声报”认为，由于美国工业开工不足，购买外国原料的数量也会随之减少。因此，目前受影响最大的首先是向美国输出原料的国家。这家报纸引“比较不悲观的”专家的估计，认为美国今年的进口贸易大约将减少7％到8％。而随着衰退加剧，工厂产品的滞销和失业工人的增加将会使美国进一步限制进口，这就使去年对美国出口开始有所增加的各个西欧国家受到不利的影响。
