Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 10th: The funeral of Groza, Chairman of the Romanian Great National Assembly Presidium, was solemnly held in Bucharest today.

    Since Chairman Groza was a Greek Orthodox Christian, religious representatives first held a religious ceremony for Chairman Groza's funeral at eight o'clock this morning. Participating in the ceremony were Romanian national and party leaders, members of parliament, delegations from various countries attending the Chairman's funeral, as well as the Chairman's family and friends.

    After the religious ceremony, representatives from all walks of life across the country continued to bid farewell to Chairman Groza's remains. At 9:50 a.m., party and state leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Stoica, and others made their final vigil.

    From 10:00 a.m. to 10:03 a.m., the entire country ceased all work to mourn the Chairman, and the whistles of factories, mines, trains, and ships sounded in unison. At this time, a mass memorial service was held in Republic Square. Before the meeting, Gheorghiu-Dej, Stoica, and others carried the coffin out of the Republic Palace and placed it on the platform in front of the square. Tens of thousands of people in the square sadly bid farewell to the Chairman.

    Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, Kozlov, head of the Soviet government delegation, Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese government delegation, Dobi, head of the Hungarian government delegation, and others delivered eulogies at the meeting.

    Gheorghiu-Dej said that the people of our country highly appreciate Peter Groza's outstanding contributions to the implementation of the People's Republic's policies and the maintenance of peace and relaxation of international tensions. Dr. Groza was not a member of the Romanian Workers' Party, but the working class and our party consider him to be a great and loyal friend of ours.

    Kozlov, on behalf of the CPSU Central Committee, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and all the Soviet people, expressed deep condolences on the passing of Comrade Groza at the memorial service.

    Guo Moruo said in his eulogy that the unfortunate death of Chairman Groza caused the Communist Party of China, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, the government, and the entire Chinese people to feel infinite grief, just like the fraternal Romanian people.

    At 11:00 a.m., Gheorghiu-Dej, Stoica, and others lifted Chairman Groza's coffin from the platform and slowly placed it on a gun carriage. The funeral procession slowly moved towards the Ghencea Military Cemetery in the sound of mourning music.

    At 2:00 p.m., the Chairman's coffin arrived at the military cemetery. At the burial, religious representatives sang elegies. Subsequently, Romanian Minister of the Council Stoica delivered a farewell speech.

    After a 24-gun salute, the coffin was slowly lowered into the tomb in the sound of mourning music.

    在礼炮齐鸣二十四响后，灵柩在哀乐声中徐徐落入墓穴中。
