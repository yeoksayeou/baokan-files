Exposure of the Essence of "Democracy"
    Dong Fengya

    It is said that the French government is about to make new contributions to the development of bourgeois democracy. This is to establish a system through constitutional amendments: "so that bills approved by a minority of parliamentarians are considered passed, and thus, under the same circumstances, the cabinet can continue to govern with minority support." (See Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 14, published in the People's Daily on January 16).

    Such amendments and such a system are naturally of great benefit to the "continued rule" of the bourgeois government. However, it also reflects the crisis in which the bourgeois regime in France is unable to "continue." If the basis of this crisis is due to the French people's aversion to the bourgeois regime, I believe that even with the establishment of this system, it will not "continue" for long. Because "systems" can be established by a small number of people against the will of the majority, and they can also be abolished by the majority against the will of the minority. Moreover, with the resolute opposition of the majority, this system may not even be established.

    However, this "grand plan" of the French bourgeoisie has other benefits for us. There are people in our country who always believe that our country's direct transition from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society to socialism, without going through a stage of development of a "pure bourgeois democracy" like Britain or France, is a great regret. In their minds, there is a longing and a preference for bourgeois democracy, always feeling that it is probably still a pretty good thing, and deeply regretting not having tasted this flavor. Among these people, besides those who instinctively hope to establish a bourgeois regime due to the demands of class interests, some are due to excessive trust in bourgeois propaganda and excessive emphasis on the forms of bourgeois democracy.

    Take the bourgeois parliamentary system, for example. Since all kinds of means have been used in advance to keep the representatives of the working people outside the door of the parliament hall, and only the spokespersons of the bourgeoisie are allowed in, and then they deliberate, decide, and issue orders, then the essence of this democracy, for the entire people, is naturally that the minority obeys the majority, which is extremely undemocratic. However, bourgeois propagandists refuse to say this point, and they revel in the results of their methods: Look, they were elected into parliament by the "people," they debated fiercely there, and in the end, the minority obeyed the majority, and they used voting to handle affairs! They show us such an extremely democratic form, and thus, in the understanding of some people, it seems that even the fundamental principle is that the minority obeys the majority.

    However, even so, it will always be impossible to save the bourgeoisie from its doom. Now, the French bourgeoisie is the first to reach a dead end: after all kinds of means, it still cannot prevent the representatives of the working people from entering parliament; and, things have reached such a point that if they continue to use the form of "minority obeying the majority," even the essence of "majority obeying the minority" will be shaken. The "cabinet's" inability to "continue to govern" is a manifestation of that shake-up. Thus, the French bourgeoisie has to consider tearing off the hypocritical form that can no longer cover up the substance, and restore its original face: "the majority obeys the minority." The essence of Western democracy as a whole is thus nakedly exposed. This is truly "not what they wanted," but forced by the "situation."

    However, even more serious problems will inevitably arrive more quickly as a result. We Chinese people are very familiar with such examples: when something that needs the cover of a false form to survive is forced to tear off the coat it uses to survive, its death must also arrive.

    “民主”本质的暴露
    董逢亚
    据说，法国政府对发展资产阶级民主，又要有新的贡献了，这就是通过修改宪法建立一种制度：“使得由少数议员投票赞成的法案被认为已经通过，因而在同样的情况下，内阁得以在少数支持下继续执政。”（见1月16日人民日报载新华社巴黎14日电）。
    这样的修改和这样的制度，对于资产阶级政府的“继续执政”，自然是大有好处的。然而，它同时也反映了在法国的资产阶级政权无法“继续”下去了的危机，倘这危机的基础是由于法国人民对于资产阶级政权的厌恶，我以为，就是建立了这种制度，它也“继续”不了多久。因为“制度”既可以由一小部分人违反着大多数人的意志去建立，更可以由大多数人违反着少数人的意志去取消的了。何况在多数人的坚决反对下，这种制度也未必能够建立得起来。
    然而，法国资产阶级的这种“雄图”，对于我们却有另外的好处。我们国家里有这样一种人，他们总以为，我们国家直接由半殖民地半封建社会过渡到社会主义，而没有经过一个像英国或法国那样的“纯粹的资产阶级民主”的发展阶段，是一件大憾事。在他们脑子里，对于资产阶级民主有一种憧憬，一种偏爱，老是觉得那大概还是一种挺不错的玩艺，而深为自己没有尝一尝这种味道惋惜。这种人中，除了那些因阶级利益的要求，而本能地希图建立资产阶级的政权的人以外，有些人是由于过于信赖了资产阶级的宣传，也过于看重了资产阶级民主的形式。
    就拿资产阶级的议会制度来说吧。既然事先已经用了种种手段，把劳动人民的代表，关在议会大厅的门外，而只把资产阶级的代言人放进去，然后再由他们议事、决议、发号施令，那末这种民主的实质，对全体人民来说，自然就是多数服从少数的，也就是极不民主的了；但是资产阶级的宣传家们，却无论如何都不肯说破这一点，他们津津乐道的，只是他们这种手段的结果：看呀，他们是被“人民”选举进议会里去的呀，他们在那里大争大辩的呀，而且最后是少数服从多数，用表决来办事的呀！就这样的摆给我们看这样一种极为民主的形式，于是也便在一些人的理解中，似乎连根本原则也是少数服从多数的了。
    然而，纵使这样，也总是挽回不了资产阶级的厄运。如今首先是法国的资产阶级走到了黔驴技穷的地步：种种手段之后，仍还不能阻止劳动人民的代表进入议会；而且，事情竟闹到了这样的地步，倘再继续利用“少数服从多数”的形式，连那“多数服从少数”的实质，也要受到动摇了。“内阁”的不能“继续执政”便也就是那动摇的一种表现。于是法国的资产阶级，不得不考虑撕破那已经不能掩盖实质的虚伪形式，还它一个本来面目曰：“多数服从少数”。整个西方民主的本质，于是就赤裸裸地暴露了。这真是“非所欲为”也，而迫于“势”的了。
    然而，更加严重的问题，也必将因此愈加迅速的到来。我们中国人是非常熟悉这样的例子的，当一个需要虚假形式的掩蔽才能生存的东西，被逼到不得不撕去其借以生存的外衣时，它的死亡也必到来。
