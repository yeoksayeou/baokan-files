Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 18th: Workers of the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau, in recent thematic airing-out sessions, are directing their criticism of waste primarily at the accumulation caused by blindly pursuing mechanization. This bureau purchased fifty-four belt conveyors, but this type of machinery is intended for use in mines and is not suitable for construction sites. After purchasing them, they were put into warehouses, accumulating a total of over 470,000 yuan. In order to mechanize the raising and lifting operations, eleven "roof-type cranes" worth over 100,000 yuan were also purchased, but they were also left to accumulate because the technical problems of building load-bearing for the machinery were not resolved. The civil engineering companies under this bureau applied to purchase more than eighty theodolites, specifying that they wanted to buy foreign goods. As a result, forty-five Swiss-made products were purchased, costing more than 200,000 yuan.

Living extravagantly, putting on airs, and seeking novelty and grandeur are significant loopholes. At the end of the year before last, this bureau built two family dormitories, some of which had to remain empty because everyone thought they were too expensive. The Materials Testing Institute built a four-story building, and the top floor is still vacant and not being used.

Currently, this bureau is continuing to mobilize workers to thoroughly attack the phenomenon of waste.

### 西北工程管理总局职工揭发浪费  机械没处用  房子没人住

    西北工程管理总局职工揭发浪费
    机械没处用  房子没人住
    据新华社西安18日电　西北工程管理总局职工在最近几天专题鸣放中，反浪费的矛头首先指向由盲目追求机械化所造成的积压。这个局曾购买了五十四台皮带运输机，但是这种机械是矿井用的，不适用于建筑工地，买回后便放进仓库，共积压了四十七万多元。为了要把升高起重工作机械化，还购买十一台价值十万多元的“屋顶式起重机”，结果因建筑物承载机械的技术问题未解决，也积压起来。这个局所属各土建工程公司曾申请购买八十多台经纬仪，并指定要买外国货。结果购回四十五架瑞士制的产品，共花了二十多万元。
    生活上讲阔气、摆排场和求新贪大是很大漏洞。前年底这个局曾兴建了两幢家属宿舍，有些房子因大家嫌贵不得不空闲着。材料试验所建筑的一座四层大楼，最顶上一层现在还闲空用不上。
    现在，这个局正继续发动职工，彻底向浪费现象开火。
