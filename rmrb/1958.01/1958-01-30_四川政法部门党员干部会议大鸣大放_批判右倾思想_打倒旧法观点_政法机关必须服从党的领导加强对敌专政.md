Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 29th - The recently held meeting of Party member cadres from the Sichuan Province Public Security, Procuratorate, and Judicial departments achieved a major victory in opposing the Rightists and criticizing Rightist thought.

This meeting was a rectification conference for Party member cadres in the political and legal departments convened by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. It was attended by over 900 Party member leading cadres from the province, special (municipal), and county public security, procuratorate, and judicial departments, as well as Party member leading cadres above the section and division chief level from relevant provincial departments. The meeting affirmed the tremendous achievements of Sichuan Province's political and legal work over the past few years and, in the spirit of rectification, comprehensively and systematically exposed and criticized the serious Rightist thought existing in the province's political and legal work, and criticized various erroneous arguments on the current political and legal front that oppose the Party's leadership and oppose the proletarian dictatorship. Through forms of unrestrained expression of views, great debate, and big-character posters, the meeting clarified major issues of principle, basically cleared up confused thinking, and all attendees unanimously recognized that: the political and legal departments are sharp weapons of the proletarian dictatorship and must unconditionally obey the Party's leadership. Every political and legal worker must firmly stand on the position of the working class, and in accordance with the Party and the state's policies and laws, severely crack down on all counter-revolutionaries and criminal elements, defend the people, and defend socialism. Through this serious struggle, the conspiracy of the Rightists to seize the "knife handle" of the proletarian dictatorship was completely shattered, and all attendees were tested and tempered, and their understanding and class consciousness were raised.

The meeting exposed eleven Rightists and bad elements, all of whom had usurped certain leading positions on the Sichuan Province political and legal front. The Rightists exposed were Li Juncheng, former Deputy Director of the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee Political and Legal Office and former Deputy Secretary of the Party Group of the Provincial People's Committee Political and Legal Office; Yang Ming?, Deputy Director of the Office of the Sichuan Provincial Procuratorate; Cheng Zhanhai, Deputy Procurator-General of the Chengdu Municipal Procuratorate; Li Jianyin, Procurator-General of the Leshan Special District Branch of the Provincial Procuratorate; Zhao Qingjie, Deputy Procurator-General of the Zigong Municipal Procuratorate; Du Rongmei, Deputy Procurator-General of the Neijiang Special District Branch of the Provincial Procuratorate; Yang Defa, Deputy Procurator-General of the Peng'an County Procuratorate; and Zhu Leqiu, President of the Daxian Special District Intermediate People's Court. The bad elements were Gao Bo, Deputy Director of the Notary and Lawyer Department of the Provincial Department of Justice, and Bai Xiong, President of the Guangyuan County Court; the class alien element was Zhao Yuxi, President of the Ebian County Court.

The meeting revealed that for several years, Rightists such as Li Juncheng had used their leading positions in the political and legal departments to oppose the Party's leadership and the proletarian dictatorship in every possible way, attempting to restore capitalism. They clamored that "the Party committee does not understand the law," that "the Party can only decide on policies and guidelines, and the Party can only lead political thought, not business," and that if the Party committee led business, it would be "separation of Party and government" and "separation of Party and law." They distorted "vertical leadership" and advocated that "the Procuratorate can supervise everything," placing themselves and the political and legal departments they led above the Party committee. For example, in June 1956, the Qingshen County Procuratorate reported to the Rightist Li Jianyin, Procurator-General of the Leshan Special District Branch of the Sichuan Provincial Procuratorate, via telephone and letter, that the Qingshen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had decided to use county-raised funds to build a hydropower station. The Rightist Li Jianyin then independently instructed the procuratorate to inspect the matter, report to him, and send cadres to Qingshen County to assist. As a result, the anti-Party element Xu Hancheng, Deputy Procurator-General of the Qingshen County Procuratorate, took the opportunity to illegally interrogate eight people, including the Deputy Secretary of the Qingshen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Minister of the County Committee's Organization Department, the County Head, and the Director of the Public Security Bureau, and asked the Deputy Secretary of the County Committee to press his fingerprint on the interrogation record. At the same time, he reported to Li and requested that relevant "illegal" personnel be investigated and punished. As another example, in 1955, the Rightist Zhao Qingjie, Deputy Procurator-General of the Zigong Municipal Procuratorate, personally presided over an inspection of the construction of the Municipal Finance Committee office building. He clearly knew that the construction of the Municipal Finance Committee building had been collectively discussed and decided by the Zigong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, but he still "interrogated" several responsible comrades, including the Secretary of the Zigong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Deputy Mayor of Zigong, and the Secretary-General of the Municipal Finance Committee, made "interrogation records," and asked these Party and government leaders to sign and affix their seals on the "interrogation records," made a "responsibility analysis" of these responsible comrades, and put forward "handling opinions," asking the Municipal Committee Secretary and Deputy Mayor to "make self-criticisms" and suggesting that the Secretary-General of the Municipal Finance Committee be given "appropriate administrative punishment." Later, the responsible comrade of the Municipal Committee pointed out that this matter should be re-reported to the Municipal Committee after further study with relevant parties, but the Rightist Zhao Qingjie ignored the instructions of the Party Committee and, without research by the Procuratorate Party Group, arbitrarily printed and distributed the "Inspection Report," attempting to create a fait accompli and attack the leadership.

These Rightists also negated Sichuan Province's achievements in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and promoted reactionary theories such as the bourgeois "presumption of innocence" and "benefit of the doubt" in trial work, trying every means and excuse to exonerate counter-revolutionaries and various criminal elements, and let the enemy go free. Some Rightists even slandered the death penalty for murderers as "revenge." Under the influence of "presumption of innocence," "benefit of the doubt," and Rightist thought, many places saw the emergence of fallacies such as "six not counted as crimes," "eight not handled," "five not arrested," and "ten not sentenced" to defend criminals. Among the "six not counted as crimes," there was "a puppet township chief who arrested 24 progressive people during his term of office was considered to be 'performing his duties' and not counted as a crime"; and for a criminal who raped 14 people before liberation and 10 people after liberation, it was considered that "there were fewer rapes after liberation than before liberation, there was 'improvement,' and it was not counted as a crime." Among the "ten not sentenced," there were "young people not sentenced," "old people not sentenced," and so on. These various absurd arguments and practices, in some places, for a period of time, fueled the arrogance of criminal elements and brought certain losses to work.

The meeting severely criticized the more prevalent Rightist thought among political and legal cadres in Sichuan Province. Many facts revealed at the meeting proved that those with Rightist thought and who approved of old legal concepts relaxed the proletarian dictatorship, making the proletarian weapon of dictatorship against the enemy weak and powerless.

The meeting also revealed that the bourgeois individualism and privilege-seeking thought among a portion of political and legal cadres in Sichuan Province was relatively common and serious, and a few people had even degenerated and deteriorated. The materials revealed at the meeting showed that although these people were only a very small number, the losses they brought to the Party were very great.

The more than 3,500 big-character posters posted during the unrestrained expression of views at the meeting raised more than 4,000 suggestions and also revealed the three isms existing in the province's political and legal work, providing a basis for the political and legal departments to implement the mass line and thoroughly rectify in the future. The meeting also arranged the tasks of the political and legal departments for 1958 on the basis of correcting the political direction of political and legal work.

    四川政法部门党员干部会议大鸣大放
    批判右倾思想　打倒旧法观点
    政法机关必须服从党的领导加强对敌专政
    新华社成都29日电　最近举行的四川省公安、检察、司法部门党员干部会议，取得了反右派和批判右倾思想的重大胜利。
    这次会议是中共四川省委召开的一次政法部门党员干部整风大会，参加会议的有省、专（市）、县的公安、检察、司法部门的党员负责干部和省级有关部门科、处长以上的党员负责干部共九百多人。会议肯定了几年来四川省政法工作的巨大成绩，以整风的精神全面地系统地揭露和批判了全省政法工作中存在着的严重右倾思想，批判了当前政法战线上反对党的领导和反对无产阶级专政的种种错误论点。会议通过大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报的形式，辨明了大是大非，基本上澄清了混乱思想，所有到会的人员一致认识到：政法部门是无产阶级专政的锐利武器，必须无条件地服从党的领导。每一个政法工作人员，必须坚定地站在工人阶级的立场上，根据党和国家的政策方针和法律，严厉地打击一切反革命分子和刑事犯罪分子，保卫人民，保卫社会主义。通过这场严重的斗争，右派分子妄图夺取无产阶级专政的“刀把子”的阴谋被彻底粉碎了，所有到会人员都受到考验和锻炼，提高了认识和阶级觉悟。
    会上揭发了十一名右派分子和坏分子，他们都在四川省政法战线上窃踞一定的领导职务。被揭发出来的右派分子有原四川省人民委员会政法办公室副主任、原省人民委员会政法党组副书记李俊成，四川省检察院办公室副主任杨鸣?，成都市检察院副检察长成占海，省检察院乐山专区分院检察长李建寅，自贡市检察院副检察长赵清洁，省检察院内江专区分院副检察长杜荣梅，蓬安县检察院副检察长杨德发，达县专区中级人民法院院长朱乐秋；坏分子有省司法厅公证、律师处副处长高波，广元县法院院长白雄；阶级异己分子有峨边县法院院长赵玉玺。
    会上揭露：几年来，李俊成等右派分子利用在政法部门的领导职务，从各方面千方百计地来反对党的领导，反对无产阶级专政，企图使资本主义复辟。他们叫嚣什么“党委不懂法律”，“党只能决定政策方针，党只能领导政治思想，不能领导业务”，说是党委如果领导了业务就是“党政不分”，“党法不分”。他们曲解“垂直领导”，主张“检察院可以监督一切”，把自己和所领导的政法部门置于党委之上。如1956年6月，青神县检察院将中共青神县委决定用县自筹经费修建水电站一事，用电话、信函向右派分子、四川省检察院乐山专区分院检察长李建寅反映，右派分子李建寅即自行指示该院检查此事，向他报告，并派干部去青神县协助。因而反党分子、青神县检察院副检察长许汉成借机非法讯问了中共青神县委副书记、县委组织部长、县长、公安局长等八人，并叫县委副书记在讯问笔录上按了指纹，同时向李汇报，要求查处有关“违法”人员。又如在1955年，右派分子、自贡市检察院副检察长赵清洁亲自主持对市财委办公大楼的修建问题进行检查。他明知市财委大楼修建问题都是经中共自贡市委集体讨论决定的，但他仍对中共自贡市委书记、自贡市副市长、市财委秘书长等几位负责同志进行了“讯问”，作了“讯问笔录”，并要这些党政负责人在“讯问笔录”上签名画押，对这些负责同志作了“责任分析”和提出了“处理意见”，要市委书记和副市长“检讨”，建议行政上给市财委秘书长“适当处分”。后来，市委负责同志指出此事应与有关方面再行研究后重报市委，但右派分子赵清洁对党委指示置之不理，也未经检察院党组研究，竟擅自将“检察报告”印发，企图造成事实，打击领导。
    这些右派分子还否定四川省肃反成绩，宣扬审判工作中的资产阶级“无罪推定论”、“有利被告论”等反动理论，想尽一切办法和借口为反革命分子和各种刑事犯罪分子开脱罪责、放纵敌人，有的右派分子竟然诬蔑对杀人犯判死刑是“复仇主义”。在“无罪推定论”“有利被告论”和右倾思想影响之下，许多地方出现了“六不算罪”、“八不处理”、“五不捕”、“十不判”等为犯罪分子辩护的谬论。在“六不算罪”中，就有“伪乡长在任职期中，逮捕过进步人士二十四人，认为是‘履行职务’，不算犯罪”；对于解放前强奸十四人，解放后强奸十人的犯罪分子，认为“解放后比解放前强奸少了，有‘改进’，不算犯罪”。“十不判”中，有什么“青年不判”、“老年不判”等等。这些形形色色的荒谬论点和作法，在一些地方，在一个时期内，助长了犯罪分子的嚣张气焰，给工作带来了一定的损失。
    会议对四川省政法干部中较为普遍存在的右倾思想，进行了严厉的批判。会议揭发出的许多事实证明：有右倾思想和赞同旧法观点的人，放松了无产阶级专政，使无产阶级对敌专政的武器变得软弱无力。
    会议还揭发出，四川省一部分政法干部中的资产阶级个人主义、特权思想是较为普遍而严重的，少数人并已经蜕化变质。会议揭露的材料说明，这些人虽然只是极个别的，但给党带来的损失是非常大的。
    会议在大鸣大放中贴出的三千五百多张大字报，共提出四千多条意见，还揭发了全省政法工作中存在的三个主义，给今后政法部门贯彻群众路线，彻底整改提供了依据。会议并在端正了政法工作中的政治方向的基础上，布置了1958年政法部门的工作任务。
