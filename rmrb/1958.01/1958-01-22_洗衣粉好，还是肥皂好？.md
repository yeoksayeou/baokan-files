    Is Laundry Detergent Better, or Soap?
    When washing clothes, is it better to use laundry detergent or soap? Not long ago, the state-owned Shanghai Soap Factory compared their new product, "Renren Laundry Detergent," with other soaps. The results proved that "Renren Laundry Detergent" had better washing power than other soaps. It not only removes dirt but also softens hard water.
    Laundry detergent is also cheaper than soap, because the amount of grease needed to produce one ton of ordinary bar soap can produce about two tons of laundry detergent.

    洗衣粉好，还是肥皂好？
    洗衣服，用洗衣粉好呢，还是用肥皂好？不久以前，国营上海制皂厂把他们生产的新产品——人人洗衣粉和其他肥皂作比较，结果证明用“人人洗衣粉”洗衣服，比其他肥皂的洗涤效力都好，不但退泥，而且有软化硬水的作用。
    洗衣粉的价钱也比肥皂便宜，因为生产一吨一般的块状肥皂所需用的油脂，可以生产两吨左右的洗衣粉。
