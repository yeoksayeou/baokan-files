Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: A West German parliamentary delegation, led by the Vice-President of the West German Federal Parliament, Richard Jaeger, flew to Taiwan on January 6th for a two-week visit. On the 20th, the delegation flew to Jinmen (Quemoy), inspected the Chiang army's frontline fortifications, and visited Chiang's troops stationed there.

The delegation included eight parliamentarians from the West German ruling parties, six from Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union, and two from the German Party. Majonica, a Christian Democratic Union parliamentarian who follows U.S. imperialism and deliberately opposes the Chinese people, was the main organizer of the delegation. After visiting Taiwan at the end of 1956 and returning to West Germany, Majonica established a so-called "Sino-German Association" in Bonn, with himself as the chairman, engaging in activities to obstruct and undermine the development of friendly relations between the German people and China, and colluding with the Chiang gang in Taiwan.

It is said that the purpose of these parliamentarians' visit to Taiwan is to strengthen cooperation between Bonn and the Chiang Kai-shek Group, develop economic and cultural relations between West Germany and Taiwan, and study the possibility of West German "investment" in Taiwan, thereby supporting the U.S. imperialist policy of occupying our territory Taiwan and creating "two Chinas."

This action by the Bonn parliamentarians violates the German people's friendship with China, and has therefore aroused opposition from all sectors of German society. The press release of the West German Social Democratic Party on the 7th strongly condemned it under the title "Chiang Kai-shek's Germans," pointing out that "this will not only be seen as a provocation against China, which has a population of 600 million, but also as a provocation against the people and governments of many countries in Asia."

    破坏中德人民友谊　支持美国侵台政策
    西德八名议员同蒋帮勾搭
    新华社23日讯　由西德联邦议院副议长理夏德·耶格尔率领的一个西德议员访问团于1月6日飞往台湾进行为期两周的访问。该团曾于20日飞往金门，视察蒋军前线工事，并参观驻扎在该地的蒋军。
    访问团包括西德执政党的议员八人，其中六人属于阿登纳的基督教民主联盟，二人属于德意志党。而追随美帝国主义、蓄意与中国人民为敌的基督教民主联盟议员马约尼卡则是该团的主要组织者。马约尼卡于1956年底访问台湾返西德后，即在波恩成立了一个所谓“中德协会”，由他本人自任会长，从事阻挠和破坏德国人民同中国发展友好关系的活动，并且同台湾蒋帮进行勾搭。
    据说，这些议员访问台湾的目的是要加强波恩和蒋介石集团之间的合作，发展西德和台湾之间的经济和文化关系，以及研究西德在台湾进行“投资”的可能性，从而支持美国霸占我国领土台湾和制造“两个中国”的帝国主义政策。
    波恩议员这一行动是违反德国人民对中国的友谊的，因而引起了德国各界人士的反对，西德社会民主党的新闻公报于7日以“蒋介石的德国人”为题予以强烈的谴责，指出“这不仅将被看成是对拥有六亿人口的中国的挑衅，而且也会被看成是对亚洲许多国家的人民和政府的挑衅”。
