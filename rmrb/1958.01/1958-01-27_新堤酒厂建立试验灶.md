    Xindi Distillery Establishes Experimental Stoves
    (Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 26th) The leading cadres of the Xindi Distillery in Honghu County, Hubei Province, have gone deep into the workshops to conduct experimental stoves, achieving good results.
    Before the rectification campaign, the leading cadres of this distillery did not go deep into the workshops. Some cadres did not even know how many stoves and sieves there were. The factory director could not grasp the key to production when he went to the workshop, and could only take a superficial look. The workers criticized this situation during the rectification campaign. The factory's leading cadres promptly made a review and were determined to put down their airs, learn the leadership methods of agricultural production in running experimental fields, and go deep into the workshops to conduct experimental stoves.
    After they went to the workshops, they sincerely learned from the workers and quickly mastered the production technology. At the same time, they also took the lead in promoting the advanced experiences of brother distilleries. The wine output rate of the experimental stoves has been greatly improved, from the original 54.9 jin per 100 jin of red sorghum to 62 jin. Other stoves have also caught up with and surpassed the experimental stoves. Individual stoves reached 62.67 jin. The distillery's overall wine output rate increased by an average of 14.55 jin compared to December of last year.

    新堤酒厂建立试验灶
    据新华社武汉26日电　湖北省洪湖县新堤酒厂的领导干部深入车间搞试验灶，取得良好效果。
    整风以前，这个酒厂的领导干部不深入车间，有的干部连一个灶几个淘箩都不知道。厂长下车间抓不到生产关键，只能走马观花。工人在整风中对这种情况提出了批评。厂的领导干部及时作了检查，决心放下架子，学习农业生产搞试验田的领导方法，深入车间搞试验灶。
    他们下到车间以后，真心实意地向工人学习，很快便掌握了生产技术。同时，他们还以身作则地推广了兄弟酒厂的先进经验。试验灶的出酒率大大提高了，每百斤红粮由原出酒五十四点九斤提高到六十二斤。其他的灶也纷纷赶上和超过了试验灶。个别灶达到六十二点六七斤。全厂的出酒率比去年12月份平均提高十四点五五斤。
