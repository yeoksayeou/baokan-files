Sichuan Province has made achievements in promoting Putonghua. From October 1955 to the present, more than 58,000 middle school, primary school, and normal school Chinese language teachers in Sichuan Province have received Putonghua pronunciation training.

From the winter of 1955 to the summer of 1956, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education held Putonghua pronunciation training classes in Chengdu and Chongqing, respectively, training 4,300 teachers for the promotion of Putonghua. All special districts, cities, and counties in the province also used winter and summer vacations to conduct Putonghua pronunciation training for local middle school and primary school Chinese language teachers, spare-time school teachers, government cadres, and broadcasters. Since 1956, many middle schools, primary schools, and normal schools in the province have begun to use Putonghua for teaching Chinese language classes. New teaching materials and phonetic alphabets have been adopted in the first grade of primary school.

In addition, in order to further promote the learning of Putonghua in society and to facilitate people with different dialects to learn Putonghua, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education, Sichuan People's Broadcasting Station, Sichuan People's Publishing House and other units have respectively held lectures on Putonghua pronunciation teaching, compiled and published Putonghua textbooks and reference books, and completed the general survey of dialects in 159 counties (cities) in the Han Chinese areas of the province.

    普通话在四川
    四川省推广普通话有成绩。从1955年10月开始到现在，四川全省已有五万八千多名中、小学和师范学校的语文教师，受过普通话语音训练。
    在1955年冬天到1956年夏天，四川省教育厅曾分别在成都、重庆两地举办了普通话语音训练班，训练培养了推广普通话的师资四千三百人。全省各专区、市、县也利用寒假和暑假对本地的中、小学语文教师、业余学校教师、机关干部、广播员等进行了普通话语音训练。从1956年起，省内许多中、小学和师范学校的语文课即开始用普通话教学。小学一年级都采用了新教材，教学注音字母。
    此外，为了在社会上进一步开展学习普通话的宣传，便利方言不同的人学习普通话，四川省教育厅、四川人民广播电台、四川人民出版社等单位，还分别举办了普通话语音教学讲座，编写、出版了普通话教材和参考书，完成了全省汉民族地区一百五十九个县（市）的方言普查。　（新华社）
