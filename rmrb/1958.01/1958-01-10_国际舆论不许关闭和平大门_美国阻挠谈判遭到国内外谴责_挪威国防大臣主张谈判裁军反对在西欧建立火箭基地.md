Comprehensive report by our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency reports: The U.S. government’s attitude of disregarding Soviet peace initiatives and obstructing East-West talks has been strongly condemned by public opinion at home and abroad. At the same time, the calls for negotiations continue to echo.

Cairo newspapers on the 8th unanimously condemned the negative attitude of the United States towards the Soviet peace proposals, believing that this is "a violation of the interests of the people of the world and detrimental to peace." "Al-Ahram" said: "The only explanation for this attitude is that the United States wants to obstruct any steps towards international understanding, fearing that the development of such reconciliation will damage American influence in the West." "Al Massa" said in an editorial that the United States fears that the easing of tensions will result in the cessation of arms production, thereby reducing the profits of monopoly capitalists. In addition, if tensions are eased, the excuse for the United States to control other countries will also disappear. Cairo Radio said that the U.S. attitude shows that the United States still insists on the policy of producing nuclear weapons, arms race, maintaining blocs, and concluding aggressive treaties.

Some American newspapers pointed out that the pressure of world opinion does not allow the United States to close the door to negotiations with the Soviet Union. "New York Times" reporter Hamilton said that according to the opinion of most Western representatives in the United Nations, "the United States and its allies should agree to hold negotiations at some time and place. They believe that if the United States refuses to negotiate, or agrees to negotiate but gives the impression of being unwilling to sincerely seek a solution, then our relationship with the allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will cause unpleasantness."

"New York Herald Tribune" said that now, as the whole world enters a new year, in the diplomatic world, "the word negotiation prevails over everything else." While continuing to advocate "power politics," the newspaper admitted: "The call for an agreement in Europe is growing, and it will ease the tension between East and West."

In addition, some American congressmen and newspapers have criticized Dulles for obstructing negotiations and demanded his resignation. U.S. Democratic Senator Magnuson said that if Dulles resigned, it would be "psychologically the best thing for Western countries." Democratic Senator Humphrey also called for Dulles' resignation in a speech in Chicago.

"Chicago Daily News" publisher Knight said in an editorial criticizing Dulles that before the launch of the Soviet satellite, American foreign policy was based on the principle of "positions of strength." Dulles sometimes threatened with "massive retaliation" and sometimes used dollars to lure America's allies and neutral countries. Now, the Soviet Union's scientific achievements are advancing rapidly, and the soap bubbles blown by Dulles have completely burst. However, Dulles still clings to policies that are impossible to achieve and fruitless. Knight called for Dulles to be removed from his leadership position in American foreign policy.

The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" published an editorial on the 8th saying that as Western countries are preparing to reply to Bulganin's letter, "it becomes more and more obvious that Secretary of State Dulles is the main stumbling block in seeking diplomatic reconciliation."

The newspaper then wrote: Dulles will "ask Russia to 'show its sincerity' and ask Russia to make concessions on disarmament before starting any political negotiations." The newspaper believes that "this is a hypocritical attitude" and not to seek a real agreement.

Norwegian Defense Minister Hauge said at the Oslo Military Association on the 8th: "We should not miss any opportunity to start disarmament negotiations."

He said: "We should abandon measures that provoke the other party, because this will weaken the determination to hold negotiations. In Norway's view, establishing medium-range rocket launch bases in the forward areas of Western Europe is a measure of this nature. Therefore, Norway believes that it is best to cancel the decision to establish medium-range rocket bases."

He said that the Norwegian government "has stated for the above reasons that Norway has no plans to establish atomic weapons depots on its territory."

Canadian newspapers believe that when the Canadian government replies to the Soviet letter, it should still open the door to negotiations with the Soviet Union to safeguard peace. The "Windsor Star" said that the whole world hopes for "a sincere attempt to resolve disputes so that countries can live together." The "Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph" wrote that it is necessary to "take a sincere attitude towards a wide discussion of all disputed issues." The "Ottawa Citizen" expressed its belief that an agreement could be reached on disputed issues. The "Citizen" believes that the proposal to establish nuclear-weapon-free and hydrogen-weapon-free zones in Europe and the proposal to stop testing nuclear weapons represent the interests of a wide range of different people and can serve as a starting point for East-West negotiations.

    国际舆论不许关闭和平大门
    美国阻挠谈判遭到国内外谴责
    挪威国防大臣主张谈判裁军反对在西欧建立火箭基地
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国政府漠视苏联和平倡议和阻挠东西方会谈的态度，受到国内外舆论的强烈谴责。与此同时，主张谈判的呼声继续回响不绝。
    开罗各报8日一致谴责美国对于苏联和平建议的否定态度，认为这是“违反全世界人民的利益和不利于和平的”。“金字塔报”说：“这种态度的唯一的解释是，美国要阻挠走向国际谅解的任何步骤，深怕这种和解的发展会损害美国在西方的影响。”“晚报”在社论中说，美国惧怕紧张局势缓和结果会使武器生产停止，因而垄断资本家们的利润下降。此外，假如紧张局势得到缓和美国控制其他国家的借口也将消失。开罗电台说，美国的态度说明美国仍然要坚持生产核武器、军备竞赛、保持集团和缔结侵略性条约的政策。
    美国一些报纸指出，世界舆论的压力不容许美国关上同苏联谈判的大门。“纽约时报”记者汉密尔顿说，根据联合国大多数西方代表的意见，“美国和它的盟国应该同意在某时某地举行谈判。他们认为，如果美国拒绝谈判或者是虽然同意谈判但是使人感到不愿意诚恳地求得解决，那么，我们和北大西洋公约组织同盟国的关系就会引起不愉快”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”说，现在，当整个世界进入新的一年的时候，在外交界，“谈判这个字比其他一切都占优势”。这家报纸在继续鼓吹“实力政策”的同时承认：“欧洲要求达成协议的呼声正在日益扩大，它将缓和东方和西方之间的紧张关系”。
    另外，有些美国议员和报纸抨击杜勒斯阻挠谈判，并且要他下台。美国民主党参议员麦格纳逊说，如果杜勒斯辞职，这对西方国家说来在“心理上将是一件最好不过的事情”。民主党参议员汉弗来也在芝加哥发表的演说中要求杜勒斯辞职。
    “芝加哥每日新闻”发行人奈特在一篇抨击杜勒斯的社论中说，在苏联卫星发射以前，美国外交政策是建立在“实力地位”的原则上的。杜勒斯忽而用“大规模的报复”来威胁，忽而用美元来诱惑美国的盟国和中立国家。现在，苏联在科学方面的成就一日千里，杜勒斯吹起来的肥皂泡已经完全破灭了。但是杜勒斯却仍然死抱住不能实现的和毫无结果的政策方针不放。奈特呼吁解除杜勒斯对美国外交政策的领导职务。
    “圣路易邮报”8日发表社论说，当西方国家纷纷准备给布尔加宁回信的时候，“就越加明显地看出，国务卿杜勒斯是谋求外交调解方面的主要绊脚石”。
    这家报纸接着写道：杜勒斯会“要求俄国‘表明自己的诚意’，要俄国在开始举行任何政治问题谈判之前就在裁军方面作让步。”报纸认为：“这是一种伪善的态度”，不是为了谋求达成真正的协议。
    挪威国防大臣汉德尔8日在奥斯陆军人协会上说：“我们不应当错过任何一个可以开始裁军谈判的机会。”
    他说：“我们应该放弃采取那种对另一方起挑衅作用的措施，因为这样会削弱举行谈判的决心。据挪威的看法，在西欧前沿地区建立中程火箭发射基地就是属于这样性质的措施。所以，挪威认为，最好是取消关于建立中程火箭基地的决定。”
    他说，挪威政府“根据上述理由声明，挪威没有任何要在本国领土上建立原子武器仓库的计划”。
    加拿大报纸认为，加拿大政府在答复苏联的信件时，在同苏联举行保障和平的谈判方面，仍然应该敞开大门。温尔索出版的“明星报”说，全世界都希望“真诚尝试解决争端，以便各国可以共同生活”。魁北克“电讯纪事报”写道，必须“对广泛讨论一切争执问题采取真诚态度”。渥太华出版的“公民报”表示相信可以就争执问题达成协议。“公民报”认为关于在欧洲建立无原子武器和无氢武器地区的建议以及停止试验核武器的建议代表着广泛的不同利益的人们，并且可以作为东西方谈判的出发点。
