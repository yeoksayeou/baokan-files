The three hundred and forty-seven members of the Xianfeng (Pioneer) Fishing Production Cooperative in Haikou, Xingcheng, Liaoning Province, after several days of socialist debate, launched a wave of buying government bonds on the morning of December 10th at the request of the masses. One said, "Branch Secretary, please write me down, I'll buy fifty yuan worth of bonds." Another said, "I'll buy one hundred yuan." An old fisherman chimed in, "Don't rush, I've thought it through now, I want to buy one thousand yuan worth of bonds..."

Why were the members of the Pioneer Fishing Cooperative so enthusiastic about buying government bonds?

The story goes like this. The cooperative's assigned task for purchasing government bonds in 1957 was 8,500 yuan. However, the members were afraid that the spring fish and shrimp production would decline, so no one dared to buy too much at the time, and the whole cooperative only pre-purchased 6,800 yuan, still short 1,700 yuan of completing the plan. However, in 1957, the fishing production was a bumper harvest, and the total income of the cooperative increased by one and a half times compared to 1956. The member with the highest labor force in the cooperative received a net distribution of 3,600 yuan this year, and even the female member with the least work points received 1,500 yuan; the average income per member was 2,200 yuan (compared to 925 yuan the previous year). Despite their high income, no one usually mentioned supplementing the purchase of government bonds, assuming that matter was long past.

However, through this debate, especially after the members specifically debated how to correctly understand the relationship between the country, the cooperative, and the individual, the members unanimously believed that the bumper fishing harvest in 1957 should be attributed to the state's priority supply of soybean oil and tung oil, which ensured that the boats and fishing nets were well-oiled; the state also supplied green hemp, coal, salt, and other materials, ensuring the smooth progress of production. Therefore, we should respond to the support given by the state with practical actions – purchasing more government bonds. In this way, the production teams of the cooperative competed to purchase bonds, and the whole cooperative purchased a total of 5,640 yuan in ten minutes. However, some members still had a wait-and-see attitude and bought very little. After studying the situation, the cooperative cadres believed that there was still great potential and decided to continue to mobilize supplementary purchases.

Just then, the cooperative received an unexpected letter. At the end of 1957, the cooperative spent 10,000 yuan in Dalian to buy a fifty-horsepower motorboat from the former Maritime Patrol Team. Now the unit selling the boat wrote, "In order to support your fishing cooperation, we will donate the motorboat you originally bought to you free of charge. The money you originally paid is now being mailed back." Hearing this news, the members jumped for joy. So, in the afternoon, all the members of the cooperative continued to rush to buy government bonds. For example, production team leader Wang Shoushan bought fifty yuan in the morning and then bought ten yuan more in the afternoon. Cooperative director Cao Jiulin bought one hundred yuan, and boat captain Song Xueyi bought three hundred yuan more. Li Youjie, a crew member of the second team, only bought two yuan in the spring. This time, he reviewed himself, saying that he was very sorry to the country, and bought seventy yuan in two installments. The first production team alone increased from 940 yuan in the morning to 5,140 yuan. Among them, the one who bought the most was old member Bai Jinchun. He had already supplemented his purchase of one thousand yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, when he heard about the donation of the motorboat by the selling unit, he ran over and asked others to add another one thousand yuan. At that time, Liu Zhongyou, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch who was next to him, asked him, "Old man, why are you buying so many government bonds?" "Ah! I'm happy!" After saying this, the old man couldn't help but shed tears. He told everyone a sad story from the past. He said, "I've been a fisherman for more than twenty years. What kind of life did we fishermen live in the past!" He looked at the new leather overcoat he was wearing now and said, "In the past, whether I was at sea or at home, I always wore a smelly and torn cotton jacket; for food, the money I earned in a day wasn't even enough to eat cornbread... Once, four of us went out to sea off Huludao, and we encountered a strong wind halfway. A wave more than thirty feet high capsized our small boat. One of our companions was washed away and disappeared, and the three of us were stranded on a deserted island for several days, freezing and starving, before we managed to return. Humph! Listen to what those gentlemen from 'Dongji Fish Shop' (a capitalist-run fish shop during the puppet Manchuria period) said: It doesn't matter whether people live or die, as long as my boats and nets aren't damaged! It's truly disheartening!" But what about now? Talking about now, the old man said excitedly, "Now that we have Chairman Mao, we have something to rely on, no matter how far we go out to sea. The weather station reports the wind force, and there are rescue boats in case of danger. It's no longer a matter of 'taking your chances'."

"Think about it, the country cares about us fishermen so much, why shouldn't I save a little and contribute more to the country? Besides, after this debate, I truly understand that the cooperative is my home!"

According to the statistics on the afternoon of December 10, the total amount of government bonds purchased by the cooperative this time (including pre-purchases and cash payments) had reached 9,903 yuan, exceeding the original plan. The fishermen also expressed their intention to adhere to the spirit of thrift, simplicity, diligence, and frugality in managing their households, and to prepare for over-fulfilling the purchase of government bonds for 1958.

    先锋渔业社买公债的故事
    文九鼎
    辽宁兴城海口先锋渔业生产合作社的三百四十七名社员，经过了几天的社会主义大辩论之后，在群众的要求之下，12月10日上午，掀起了一个购买公债的热潮。这个说：“支书同志，你给我记上，我买五十元公债。”那个说：“我买一百元。”另一位老渔民抢着说：“你们别忙，现在我想通了，我要买一千元公债……。”
    先锋渔业社的社员们为什么这样积极购买公债呢？
    事情原来是这样。这个合作社1957年分配到的购买公债任务是八千五百元。而社员们怕春季鱼虾减产，当时谁也不敢多买，全社一共只预购了六千八百元，还差一千七百元没有完成计划。可是，1957年渔产丰收，全社收入却比1956年增加了一倍半，社里劳动力最高的社员，这一年净分了三千六百元，连工分最少的女社员也分了一千五百元；每个社员平均收入二千二百元（前年是九百二十五元）。尽管他们的收入是这样多，平时却谁也没有提出补购公债的事情，以为那事早已过去了。
    但是，通过这次大辩论，尤其是社员们专题辩论了怎样正确认识国家、合作社和个人之间的关系之后，社员们一致认为：1957年渔业丰产，应当感谢国家优先供给豆油、桐油，使船和渔网油得好；国家还供应了青麻、煤、盐等，保证了生产能够顺利进行。因此我们应当以实际行动——多认购公债来回答国家所给予的支持。就这样，该社各生产队争先认购起来，在十分钟的时间里全社一共认购了五千六百四十元。但是也有的社员还有观望思想，买得很少。社干部研究了情况以后，认为还有很大潜力，决定继续动员补购。
    正在这时，社里收到了一封料想不到的来信。这个社在1957年底花了一万元在大连买了原海巡队一艘五十马力的汽艇，现在卖船单位来信说：“为了支援你们渔业合作化，我们无偿地将你们原买的这艘汽艇送给你们。原来你们所付之款，现邮寄退还。”听到这消息，社员们都高兴得跳了起来。于是，下午全社社员又继续抢购公债。如生产队长王寿山上午买了五十元，下午又增购了十元，社主任曹九林购一百元，船长宋学义增购三百元。二队船员李有杰，他春季只买了两元，这次他检讨说他很对不起国家，也分两次买了七十元。仅第一生产队就由上午的九百四十元增加到五千一百四十元。其中，买得最多的，是白金纯老社员。他在上午就补买了一千元。午后，他听说卖船单位赠送汽艇这件事，他又跑来叫别人添写了一千元。当时，在他旁边的团支书刘忠友同志便问他：“老大爷：你怎么买这么多的公债呢？”“唉！高兴呗！”这老汉说完这句话，不禁噙着热泪。他向大家诉说了一段伤心的往事。他说：“我当二十多年的渔工。过去我们渔民过的是什么样的日子呀！”他瞅了瞅他现在穿的新皮大氅，又说：“过去我下海、在家，总是穿一件又腥又破的棉短袄；吃呢，一天挣来的钱连啃窝窝头吃都不够……有一次我们有四个人在葫芦岛下潮（出海），半路遇着大风，一个三丈多高的浪头，打翻了我们的小船，其中一个同伴被打下水以后没有踪影了，剩我们三个人在孤岛上冻饿了好几天，好容易才返回来。哼！你们听‘东记鱼行’（伪满时资本家开的鱼行）的那些老爷们怎么说：人死活都不要紧，只要不碰坏我的船、网就行！说起来真叫人寒心！”可是谈到现在呢？谈到现在老汉激动地说：“而今我们有了毛主席，出海再远，性命也有依仗。刮几级风有气象台报信，遇险还有机船急救，再也不是‘闯大运’了”。
  “你们想一想，国家对我们渔民这样关心，我为啥不该节约点为国家多出一点力呢。再说，经过这次大辩论，我才真正懂得了社就是我的家呀！”
    据12月10日下午的统计，全社这次购买的公债（包括预购和付现款的），已经达到九千九百零三元，超过了原订计划。渔民们还表示要本着节约朴素，勤俭持家的精神，准备超额购买1958年度的公债。
