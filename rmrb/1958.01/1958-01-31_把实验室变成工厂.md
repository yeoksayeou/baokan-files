Turning Laboratories into Factories
Bai Sheng

    Universities are places for cultivating high-level construction talents for the country. They possess a large number of professional talents in teaching and scientific research, and have a large number of scientific instruments and some advanced teaching equipment. In addition to ensuring the completion of certain teaching and scientific research tasks, these equipment and technical forces have great potential that has not been fully utilized. How to get them moving? This is a new topic facing higher education institutions.

    In the past, the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics was like this: the utilization rate of equipment was very low, the potential of teaching internship assistants could not be brought into play, students' internships only produced waste products, and there was a great waste of raw materials used for internships. After the implementation of work-study programs and the combination of teaching internships and production, the situation changed, and the outlook was renewed. The laboratories and affiliated factories have been linked together to form an invisible "production line."

    Using teaching equipment and technical potential for production activities, turning laboratories into factories, has many benefits. For example, the things students produce during internships are finished products, which not only eliminates the waste of raw materials but also creates wealth for the country. At the same time, due to the combination of teaching and production, theory is linked to practice, which also improves the quality of teaching. Because this kind of internship is both a teaching internship and production, students greatly improve their interest and sense of responsibility in the internship, cultivate a love of labor, and experience the important significance of labor production. For experimentalists and teaching assistants, labor discipline is also strengthened in production. Many successfully trial-produced products have been put into production and have been widely used in some industrial sectors and scientific research, saving the country a sum of foreign exchange.

    Universities starting production and turning laboratories into factories can not only change the wasteful practices of bourgeois education, which wastes manpower, materials, and financial resources, and promote the spirit of hard work, but more importantly, they can establish a style of combining teaching with production and combining mental labor with physical labor, and cultivate students into laborers with culture and technology, becoming socialist builders who are both red and expert.

    Using teaching equipment and technical potential for production is an advanced practice. In order to implement the spirit of running schools with diligence and thrift, on the basis of exposing waste and raising awareness, all higher engineering colleges with laboratories and affiliated factories will be willing to strive to do so, and should do so. This practice, of course, also applies to many higher agricultural colleges with practice farms.

    If the teaching equipment and technical potential of all universities in the country are mobilized, and the laboratories are turned into factories, that would definitely be a considerable force!

    把实验室变成工厂
    柏生
    高等学校是培养国家高级建设人才的场所，它拥有大批教学和科学研究的专业人才，具有大量的科学仪器和部分先进的教学设备。这些设备和技术力量，除保证完成一定的教学和科学研究任务外，还有很大的潜力没有得到充分发挥。怎样让它们动起来呢？这是高等教学机关面临的新课题。
    北京航空学院过去就是这个样儿，设备的利用率很低，教学实习辅助人员有潜力也不能发挥，学生实习只是制造废品，实习用的原材料有很大的浪费。在实行勤工俭学、教学实习和生产结合以后，情况起了变化，面貌有了革新。各实验室、附属工厂各单位之间连结成了无形的“生产带”。
    利用教学设备和技术潜力来进行生产活动，把实验室变成了工厂，有许多好处。比如说，学生实习出来的东西就是生产成品，不但杜绝了原材料的浪费，而且给国家创造了财富。同时由于教学和生产相结合，理论联系了实际，也提高了教学质量。因为这种实习既是教学实习又是生产，学生就大大提高了实习的兴趣和责任心，培养了热爱劳动的观点，体验了劳动生产的重要意义。对实验员和教学辅助人员来说，在生产中也加强了劳动纪律。许多试制成功的产品投入生产，在一些工业部门和科学研究上也有了广泛的用途，为国家节省了一笔外汇。
    高等学校动手生产，把实验室变成了工厂，不仅可以改变资产阶级办学的那种浪费人力、物力、财力的风气，发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，而更重要的，可以树立教学与生产相结合，脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的作风，把学生培养成为有文化有技术的劳动者，成为一个又红又专的建设社会主义的战士。
    利用教学设备和技术潜力从事生产，是一种先进的做法。为了贯彻勤俭办学的精神，在揭发浪费提高认识的基础上，凡设有实验室、附属工厂的高等工科院校，都会愿意力争这样做，而且应当这样做。这个做法，当然同样适用于许多有实习农场的高等农业院校。
    假如把全国高等学校的教学设备和技术潜力都动员起来，把实验室都变成了工厂，那一定是很可观的力量！
