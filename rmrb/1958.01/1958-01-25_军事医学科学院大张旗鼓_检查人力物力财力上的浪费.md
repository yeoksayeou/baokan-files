Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: The Military Medical Science Academy, during the rectification phase, mobilized the masses to oppose waste. So far, the accumulated and wasted research equipment that has been initially exposed and investigated is worth over 678,000 yuan.

The anti-waste struggle at the Military Medical Science Academy began at the start of this month in conjunction with a special topic blooming and contending session on running science through diligence and thrift. The academy's leadership required all personnel to use revolutionary spirit to examine past waste in manpower, materials, financial resources, and time, to investigate all kinds of accumulated equipment and materials, and to re-examine this year's budget, saving where possible and reducing where possible, to fully utilize the potential of existing materials and equipment. All members of the academy actively responded to the leadership's call, universally using forms such as big-character posters and discussion meetings to expose various wasteful phenomena, and at the same time organized many inspection teams to investigate various materials separately.

Among the large quantities of accumulated and wasted materials that have been revealed and investigated, there are many valuable instruments that are incomplete, moldy, rusty, and dust-sealed. The Department of Parasitology has accumulated and wasted more than 12,000 pieces of equipment and medicines since the academy was established, including many precision instruments and valuable medicines ordered from abroad. A Zeiss dissecting microscope that could dissect individual cells had been left in the warehouse unattended for several years, but a microscope of the same brand was included in this year's foreign order budget. Under the influence of the idea of pursuing more, better, bigger, and foreign goods, the Department of Physiology accumulated and wasted materials worth a total of 200,000 yuan. They already had one electroencephalograph that was enough, but spent 100,000 yuan to buy three, and one of them was already damaged. They originally had a domestic gas analyzer worth more than 3,000 yuan, but in order to show off and be extravagant, they spent 7,000 yuan to buy a foreign one. Another department originally had 40 dissecting microscopes and microscopes, an average of one per person, but they wanted to buy another 12 in this year's budget. In addition, among these accumulated and wasted equipment, there was a new metabolism apparatus worth 7,000 yuan that was disassembled in order to use one part, sets of surgical instruments that had been dormant for six years, and a complete set of cathode oscilloscopes and telecommunications generators worth 10,000 yuan.

Currently, the leadership of the Military Medical Science Academy is organizing and leading all personnel to continue to display revolutionary spirit and vigorously criticize this extravagant "young master" style of work. At the same time, the leadership has re-examined and revised this year's budget based on the results of mass debate, reducing the domestic purchasing budget of the entire academy by 417,000 yuan.

    军事医学科学院大张旗鼓
    检查人力物力财力上的浪费
    据新华社24日讯　军事医学科学院在整改阶段中，发动群众反对浪费，到目前为止，已初步揭露和清查出来的积压、浪费的各种研究器材总值达六十七万八千多元。
    军事医学科学院的反浪费斗争是在本月初结合勤俭办科学的专题鸣放开始的。院的领导要求全院人员，以革命精神检查过去在人力、物力、财力和时间上的浪费，清查各种积压的器材和物资，并重新审查今年的预算，做到能省则省，能减则减，充分发挥现有各种物资器材的潜力。各院人员积极响应了领导上的号召，普遍通过大字报、座谈会等形式，对各种浪费现象进行揭发，同时组织许多检查小组，分头清查了各种物资。
    在揭露和清查出来的大量的积压、浪费的物资中，有许多是残缺不全、霉锈满身和尘埃密封的贵重仪器。寄生虫学系自建院以来积压和浪费的器材、药品共有一万二千多件，其中有不少是从国外订购来的精密仪器和贵重药品。有一架可以解剖单个细胞的蔡司解剖显微镜，几年来一直放在仓库里无人过问，但在今年的国外订货预算中，又开上了一个同样牌号的显微镜。生理学系在追求多、好、大和外国货的思想支配下，积压和浪费的物资器材总值达二十万元。他们本来有一部脑电波机就够用了，但花了十万元买了三部，并且其中一部已经损坏。他们本来有国产的价值三千多元的气体分析器，但为了摆排场、讲阔气，又花七千元买了一架外国货。另一个系原来就有四十架解剖镜、显微镜，平均每人一架，而今年的预算中又要购买十二架。此外，在这些积压、浪费的器材中，还有为了使用一个零件而被拆卸了的价值七千元的新陈代谢器，沉睡了六年的成套成打的外科手术器械和价值万元的全套阴极示波器和电讯发生器。
    目前，军事医学科学院的领导上正在组织和领导全体人员，继续发挥革命精神，大张旗鼓地批判这种挥金如土的“大少爷”作风。同时，领导上已根据群众辩论的结果，重新审查修改了今年的预算，全院仅在国内购货预算方面就削减了四十一万七千多元。
