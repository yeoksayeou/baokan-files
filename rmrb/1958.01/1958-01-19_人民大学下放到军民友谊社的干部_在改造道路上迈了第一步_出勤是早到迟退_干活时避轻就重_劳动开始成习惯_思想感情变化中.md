Xinhua News Agency, 18th: How should cadres who are sent to lower levels temper themselves, and what gains can they achieve after being sent down? Liu Shoupeng, the leader of the general team of cadres from the Chinese People's University sent to the Army-Civilian Friendship Agricultural Cooperative, presented a summary report discussed by all the sent-down cadres at a work conference for sent-down cadres convened by the Fengtai District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party today, regarding the three-month labor training situation. The summary pointed out that they have already taken the first step on the road to transforming themselves into working-class intellectuals.

A total of 147 cadres from the Chinese People's University were sent to the Army-Civilian Friendship Cooperative. Many people also attended work on scheduled holidays, bringing the attendance rate to 102%. They arrive early and leave late, and avoid light work while seeking difficult tasks. The peasants praised them: willing to work, willing to learn, and working hard.

The report said that the vast majority of these 147 cadres were previously "white-faced scholars," "unaccustomed to physical labor, unable to distinguish the five grains, unable to lift with their hands, and unable to carry on their shoulders." From the first day of being sent down, they decided to learn from scratch, as primary school students. However, there were initially many difficulties. They first overcame the difficulties in life and adapted themselves to the rural living environment.
	Coarse Grains Taste Good, Sleeping in Collective Dormitories is Sweet
	Everyone is Accustomed to Rural Living Conditions

Changing the diet from white flour to corn buns was a huge change. Initially, some people felt heartburn after eating corn buns, and some experienced "gastrointestinal revolution." Some took stomach medicine, but this did not fundamentally solve the problem. Their experience is that only in heavy physical labor, the appetite sharply increases, allowing their stomach and intestines to adapt to rural food. At the same time, coupled with the subjective understanding that every grain of rice and every dish is hard-won, after gritting their teeth and eating for half a month, eating became natural. Now, they not only can eat rural food, but also eat it with relish, and their food intake has increased by 30% to 50%. Gastrointestinal diseases have also been basically eliminated.

They were also very unaccustomed to the collective living conditions at first. After work, some washed their faces, some washed their feet. When sleeping, beds were next to each other, people were crowded together, some snored, some talked in their sleep, and some got up to urinate. This was a big change for intellectual cadres who were accustomed to urban life. But after labor, everyone slept very sweetly. In collective life, everyone is as close as family. Now many people have fallen in love with this kind of life.

	From Delicate Hands to Calloused Palms
	Able to Withstand the Test of Hard Labor

The report said: It is relatively easy to overcome the difficulties in life, but more importantly, it is necessary to overcome the difficulties in physical labor. From holding a pen to holding a hoe, from delicate hands to full palms of calluses, this is a serious test. Picking spinach and peanuts are light work, but working all day, constantly working, the test comes, at this time, the waist is sore and the legs are painful, and even unable to stand up immediately. Using an iron pickaxe to dig frozen soil chunks of a foot or so, the soil is as hard as stone. With one pickaxe swing, only one or two inches can be dug in, and the hand is shocked and hurts. Using the shoulders to carry a hundred pounds of sand or sweet potatoes, at the beginning, the head is heavy and the feet are light, swaying, and unable to carry it for half a day, the shoulders hurt so much that they dare not touch it. Especially in the first few days, everyone experienced three pains: hand pain, waist pain, and leg pain. Blisters appeared on the hands, and when tying cabbage for a long time, the waist and legs were sore and painful. At night, it took a lot of effort to lift the legs onto the bed. However, relying on a high degree of self-consciousness and a tenacious spirit of hard work and unyielding, they finally overcame the difficulties. If blisters appeared on their hands, they were not afraid and continued to work. Before long, the blisters turned into calluses and no longer blistered. If the waist and legs were sore and painful, they gritted their teeth and persevered. After a few days of exercise, they became relaxed. If the hands were out of strength, they rested for a while. After a long period of training, they became stronger, and the strength became greater day by day.

The report said: After this effort, they have learned general agricultural production knowledge from the peasants. Such as harvesting Chinese cabbage, picking peanuts, digging sweet potatoes, shelling corn cobs, digging soil, carrying soil, building livestock sheds, and padding pig and cattle pens. Some have also learned how to raise pigs and drive carts. Now, most of the sent-down cadres can do these jobs about the same as farmers with medium conditions, and a few have reached the production level of farmers with stronger labor. On individual jobs, they also have some creations. One sent-down cadre, in hitting peanuts, summarized the peasants' operating experience and used the assembly line method, completing the fifteen-day task in five days.
	The Idea of ​​Despising Physical Labor Loses Market
	The Ideals and Sentiments of the Working People are Growing

The report said that sending them down to the countryside is not only to learn agricultural production knowledge, but more importantly, to transform their ideological stance and train themselves to become working-class intellectuals who can withstand risks and have the feelings of the working people. Through practice, labor has now become the greatest need in the lives of most people, and all thoughts and behaviors that despise physical labor have lost their market. Some cadres looked down on agricultural production and despised farmers before being sent down. Some didn't even read rural news published in newspapers. After going to the countryside, they saw the heavy and arduous nature of agricultural labor, saw the great role of agricultural production in socialist construction, and understood the excellent qualities of the peasants and the infinitely beautiful future of the countryside, which greatly changed their past erroneous perceptions. Some people wrote letters to mobilize their spouses to go to the countryside, and some wanted to move their children to live in the countryside so that their descendants could grow up in physical labor from an early age.

The report then introduced many moving scenes. Sun Zhaoxuan had no habit of labor before being sent down, and his wife had to serve him at home. Recently, when he returned home for vacation, he carried seven buckets of water in one go, which surprised the people in the same courtyard, who said he had "changed." He Weixu used to run away when he saw his child defecate, but now he rushes to pick up manure. Many people used to cover their noses and pass by manure carts and garbage trucks before being sent down, but now they have become active in picking up manure. Ying Zhenxiang said: "Every time I see the fertilizer in the fertilizer pit piled higher and higher, my feelings for it become deeper and deeper. Every time I pass this place, I always turn back to look at it with nostalgia." Some sent-down cadres shelled corn cobs, sweating profusely in the tense labor, and the cob leaves, as sharp as knives, cut their hands. After sweating and bleeding like this, they harvested the good corn, and they said with emotion: How can this not make me fall in love with corn buns? Shao Yinmin, who came from a landlord family, also knew about class contradictions when he studied Marxism-Leninism in the past, but he could never understand why the peasants hated the landlords so deeply. Now, he has experienced that the fruits of labor are exchanged for sweat and blood, and the landlords have plundered the grain that the peasants have worked so hard to obtain without compensation. How can the peasants not hate the landlords to the bone? Even he himself has increased his hatred.

	The Sincere and Frank Qualities of the Peasants
	Deeply Educate the Cadres

The report said that the peasants' sincere and simple, consistent spirit and style have also deeply educated them. In the initial labor, the peasants let them do light work and worked with women. When someone got sick, they made noodles and dumplings for them to eat. But the peasants also frankly pointed out their shortcomings. If some cadres missed one or two cobs when shelling corn because they wanted to be fast, the peasants would immediately tell him to pick up the two cobs. Although the criticism was stern, when the work of the person being criticized was done well, they immediately praised it. The report said that this is completely different from the "maybe" and "possibly" when intellectuals criticize, saying half a sentence and swallowing half a sentence, and being irrelevant for a long time. At the beginning of being sent to the countryside, they were not used to this frank style of the peasants, but now some people have begun to do so.

	Sharing Happiness and Disgust, Sharing Hobbies
	Becoming One with the Peasants

The report also pointed out that they have been able to become one with the peasants in many aspects, sharing happiness and disgust, and sharing hobbies. In the past, some people tried their best to avoid dusty peasants. Now, they deal with mud and crops all day long, and they know that only lazy people and rascals are not covered in dirt. Therefore, they not only do not dislike the peasants for being dirty, but they are also willing to wear white headscarves and coarse cloth clothes, feeling that the more they look like peasants, the better. Some people used to feel ashamed when they wore slightly worse clothes. Now, when they take a vacation to the city, they still wear the cotton clothes and cloth shirts they wear for work, holding their heads high and striding forward. Some people used to spend thirty or forty yuan a month and still didn't think it was enough. If they didn't have money, they would reach out to the public for subsidies. Some people used to eat first-class dishes and still didn't enjoy them. Now, when they return home, they mobilize their families to be careful in calculation, to manage the family diligently and frugally, and some have even made a family saving plan. The report said: This kind of change seems to be only in terms of life, but its significance far exceeds the scope of life. It shows that the thoughts and feelings of these intellectual cadres are undergoing drastic changes.

	The Facts of the Struggle Between the Two Roads in the Countryside
	Educate Everyone in Class Struggle

The report specifically pointed out that the actual class struggle situation in the countryside has given them the most valuable lesson, eliminating many erroneous perceptions in the past. The report said: In the early days of the rectification movement, some of them were influenced by bourgeois rightists and had also followed suit in making erroneous remarks such as the peasants' lives were too hard, the gap between workers and peasants was too large, and there were shortcomings in unified purchase and sales. Now, they have realized that they have been deceived by rightists from the income of the members of the Army-Civilian Friendship Cooperative. In 1957, the average income per household in the Army-Civilian Friendship Cooperative had reached more than 500 yuan, and individual households had reached more than 1,000 yuan. Many households had a surplus of two or three hundred yuan, or even five or six hundred yuan. Their lives have improved countless times compared with before liberation. In 1956, this cooperative encountered a huge flood. The state guaranteed the supply of grain, and no one ate bran. The unified purchase and sales are really good. This point is particularly deeply felt by those who made mistakes in the rectification movement. They said, if I had come down half a year earlier, I would not have made the mistakes of the past. Then the report also cited many specific examples of class struggle in the countryside, narrating the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements, and the scene of the laboring peasants patrolling and guarding, always maintaining revolutionary vigilance. The report said: Now, many of them have brightened their eyes and truly realized that the struggle between the two roads is the main contradiction in the transition period.

The report said that the above situation proves the correctness of the party's policy of sending people down, which is a shortcut to transforming intellectuals quickly and well. Sending cadres down is in line with the interests of the party, the country, and the people, and it is also extremely beneficial to the cadres themselves.

This report also summarized the mass work done by the sent-down cadres, pointed out the existing shortcomings, and put forward suggestions for the future. The main shortcoming is that some people only bury themselves in production, ignore politics, and do not consider or rarely consider the issue of ideological transformation, thinking that "coming down is nothing more than carrying and doing things." Therefore, they do not approach the masses, do not care about the work of the cooperative, and are unwilling to participate in the meetings of the members. If they participate, they only listen and are unwilling to speak. They rarely use their brains to consider some of the problems they encounter in their daily lives. Some don't even read the newspaper anymore. This is a non-political tendency. In addition, the leaders of individual sent-down teams also do not pay attention to political and ideological work. Some have not held a more strict organizational life meeting until now. The report believes that this phenomenon must be corrected.

    人民大学下放到军民友谊社的干部
    在改造道路上迈了第一步
    出勤是早到迟退　干活时避轻就重  劳动开始成习惯　思想感情变化中
    新华社18日讯　下放干部应该怎样锻炼自己，下放以后有些什么收获？军民友谊农业社中国人民大学下放总领队刘寿彭今天在中共丰台区委召集的下放干部工作会议上，就三个月的劳动锻炼情形，提出了一个经过全体下放干部讨论过的总结报告。总结中指出：他们在改造成为工人阶级知识分子的道路上已经迈开了第一步。
    中国人民大学下放到军民友谊社的干部共一百四十七人。许多人在规定休息的假日里也出勤，使出勤率高达102％。出勤时早到迟退，干活时避轻就重。农民赞扬他们：肯干、肯学、卖力气。
    报告中说，他们这一百四十七个干部，绝大多数人过去都是“白面书生”，“四体不勤、五谷不分、手不能提、肩不能挑”。他们从下放的第一天起，就决定从头学起，当小学生。但是在最初困难是特别多的。他们首先克服了生活上的困难，使自己适应农村生活环境。粗粮吃得香集体宿舍睡得甜
  大家习惯了农村的生活条件
    饮食由白面改成了窝窝头，这是一个极大的变化。开始时，有些人吃完窝窝头心里就发烧，有的人发生“肠胃革命”。有的人吃胃药，但这并不能从根本上解决问题。他们的经验是，只有在繁重的体力劳动中，食欲急剧增加，使自己的肠胃和农村里的食物相适应。同时，加上主观上体会到一米一菜来之不易，在硬着头皮吃了半个月之后，饮食就自如了。现在他们吃农村饭不但吃得下，而且吃得很香，饭量也增加了30％到50％。肠胃病也基本上消灭了。
    集体的住宿条件，他们开始时也很不习惯，下工以后，有洗脸的、有洗脚的。睡觉时床连床，人挤人，有打呼的，有说梦话的，有起床尿尿的，这对过惯城市生活的知识分子干部是一个很大的变迁。但是在劳动后大家都睡的很甜。在集体生活中，大家都亲如家人。现在不少人已经爱上了这种生活。
  从纤纤双手到满掌老茧
    经得住艰苦劳动的考验
    报告说：生活上的困难是比较容易地克服了，更重要的是克服了体力劳动上的困难。由拿笔杆到拿锄头，由纤纤双手到满掌老茧，这是一个严重的考验。择菠菜拣花生都是轻活，但是整天干，不停的干考验就来了，这时腰酸腿痛，甚至都不能马上站起来。用铁镐挖冰冻尺许的土块，土硬如石，一镐下去，挖进不过一两寸，而手震得直痛。用肩抬一百斤的沙土或白薯，开始时头重脚轻，摇摇晃晃，东倒西歪，挑不了半天，肩头就痛得碰都不敢碰。特别是在最初的几天，大家都经过了三痛：手痛、腰痛、腿痛。手上磨起了泡，捆白菜时间一长，就腰酸腿痛，到晚上就要煞费气力才能把腿抬上床。但是他们依靠高度的自觉性和苦干不屈的顽强精神，终于战胜了困难。手上起了泡，不怕，继续干，过不了多久，泡变成了老茧，再也不起泡了。腰酸腿痛，就咬紧牙关，坚持下去，锻炼几天，就轻松了。手没劲了，稍息一下，久炼成钢，劲就一天比一天大了。
    报告说：经过这一番努力，他们已向农民学会了一般性的农业生产知识。如收获大白菜、摘花生、刨白薯、搿玉米棒子、挖土、抬土、起牲口棚、垫猪、牛圈等等技术。有的还学会了饲养猪，赶大车等技术。现在多数下放干部从事这些工作已经和中等条件的农民差不多，少数人已达到劳动力较强的农民的生产水平。在个别的活茬上他们还有了一些创造，有一个下放干部在打花生中，总结农民的操作经验，运用流水作业法，使十五天的任务在五天里完成了。轻视体力劳动的思想失去市场劳动人民的思想感情正在成长
    报告说，他们下放到农村不仅要学会农业生产知识，更重要的是要改造自己的思想立场，锻炼成为一个经得起风险的、具有劳动人民感情的工人阶级知识分子。经过实践，现在劳动已成为多数人生活上的最大需要，一切轻视体力劳动的思想行为，已经失去了市场。有些干部在下放前轻视农业生产看不起农民，有的连报纸上刊载的农村消息都不看。下乡后，他们看到了农业劳动繁重艰巨，看到农业生产对社会主义建设的伟大作用，了解了农民的优良品质和农村的无限美好的前途，就在很大程度上改变了过去的错误认识。有的人写信动员自己的爱人下乡，有的要把自己的孩子搬到乡下住，让自己的后代从小就在体力劳动中成长。
    报告接着介绍了许多动人的情景。孙昭选下放前没有劳动习惯，在家时要爱人侍奉，最近他回家休假，一口气就抬了七桶水，使同院的人都大吃一惊，说他“变了”。何维序过去见到自己的孩子拉屎就跑开，现在拣粪抢着干。许多人在下放前见了大粪车、垃圾车，掩鼻而过，现在也都成了拾粪的积极分子。应震象说：“每当我看到积肥坑里的肥料越堆越多时，我对它的感情也越来越深，每次走过这个地方，总要留恋地回头望它几眼。”有些下放干部搿玉米棒子，在紧张的劳动中流出了汗，利如小刀的棒子叶割破了手。这样流汗流血而后换来
  了收割好的玉米，他们感动的说：这怎能不叫我爱上窝窝头。地主家庭出身的邵尹民，过去学马列主义也知道阶级矛盾，但总不能理解农民为什么那样深地仇恨地主，现在体验到了劳动成果是血汗换来的，地主无偿地掠夺了农民千辛万苦得来的粮食，农民又怎能不对地主恨入骨髓呢，就连他自己也增加了憎恨的感情。
  农民诚恳坦率的品质
      使干部受到深刻教育
    报告说，农民诚恳朴实、表里如一的精神和作风，也深深地教育了他们。在初期劳动时，农民们都让他们干轻活，和妇女编在一起进行劳动。有人生病了，就做面条、包饺子给他们吃。但是农民对他们的缺点也就心直口快地提出来。有的干部搿棒子因图快漏了一两个，农民就立刻叫他把这两个棒子拾回来。虽然批评时声色俱厉，但当被批评的人的工作作好了，他们又马上加以赞扬。报告说，这和我们知识分子在进行批评时的“也许”“可能”，说半句吞半句，半天不着边际的情况完全不同。下乡初期他们对农民这种坦率的作风还不习惯，但是现在有些人也开始这样做了。
    同喜恶共爱好
        和农民打成一片
    报告还提出了他们在许多方面已经能够和农民打成一片同喜恶共爱好，过去有些人，碰见尘土朴朴的农民就极力回避。现在整天和泥土庄稼打交道，才知道只有懒汉二流子身上才不沾土，因此不但不嫌农民脏，自己也愿意包上白头巾，穿上粗布衣，觉得越像农民越好。有些人过去穿得稍差些，就有些见不得人的样子，现在休假进城，照旧穿着干活的棉衣布衫，昂首挺胸，阔步而过。过去有些人，一个月要花三、四十元，还觉得不够用，没有钱就伸手向公家要补助。有的人过去吃甲等菜还口不甘味，现在他们回家时，就动员自己的家人精打细算，勤俭治家，有的还订了家庭节约计划。报告说：这种变化看来只是生活方面的，但其意义远远超过了生活范围，它说明了，他们这批知识分子干部的思想感情，正在起着剧烈的变化。
  农村两条道路斗争的事实
    使大家受到阶级斗争教育
    报告中特别提出农村实际的阶级斗争状况，使他们上了最宝贵的一课，消除了过去思想上的许多错误认识。报告说：在整风运动初期，他们有些人受了资产阶级右派的影响，也曾跟着发表过农民生活太苦、工农生活悬殊太大、统购统销有缺点等错误言论。现在从军民友谊社的社员收入上才明白了自己上了右派分子的当。1957年，军民友谊社每户平均收入已达到五百多元，个别户已达到一千余元。不少户节余二三百元以至五六百元，他们的生活和解放前相比不知提高了多少倍。1956年，这个社曾遇到特大的水灾，国家保证了粮食供应，没有一个人吃糠的，统购统销实在好得很。这一点在整风运动中犯过错误的人感受特别深刻，他们说，假如我早下来半年，就不会犯过去的错误了。接着报告还举出了农村中许多阶级斗争的具体事例，叙述了地主富农和坏分子的破坏活动，和劳动农民巡逻防哨，时刻保持着革命警惕性的情景。报告说：现在他们很多人，已擦亮了眼睛，真正认识到了两条道路的斗争是过渡时期的主要矛盾。
    报告说，上面这些情况归结起来证明了党的下放政策的正确性，它是一条改造知识分子又快又好的捷径。干部下放既符合于党、国家和人民的利益，又对干部本人极其有利。
    这个报告还总结了下放干部所作的群众工作，指出了存在的缺点和今后的意见。主要的缺点是有些人只埋头生产，忽视政治、不考虑或很少考虑思想改造的问题，认为“下来也不过是抬抬干干而已”。因此，不接近群众，不关心社里工作，不愿参加社员的会议，参加了也只是听听不愿发言；日常接触到的一些问题，很少动脑子去考虑；有的连报纸都不看了，这是非政治倾向。另外，有个别下放队组的领导人也不注意政治思想工作，有的到现在还没开过一次较严格的组织生活会议。报告认为这种现象必须纠正。
