The draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has been promulgated by the State Council and will be submitted to the National People's Congress for discussion and approval. The promulgation of this draft is a major event of historical significance for the people of the whole country, and it is also a major event that the minority ethnic groups in our country have been eagerly awaiting for a long time. The promulgation of this draft will have a positive impact on further mutual learning and communication among the people of all ethnic groups in our country, as well as on the creation and reform of minority ethnic languages.

Our country is a multi-ethnic country, and all ethnic groups have their own history and culture, and have fulfilled their glorious responsibilities in the creation and development of the motherland. However, due to the long-term national oppression of the reactionary rulers of the past, many ethnic feuds were caused in history, resulting in the increasing poverty of the economy and the increasing backwardness of the culture of various minority ethnic groups. Since the founding of the great People's Republic of China, nearly fifty ethnic groups, under the brilliant light of the Marxist-Leninist ethnic policies of the Party, have been permanently freed from national oppression and have become members of the great family of friendship and cooperation of the great People's Republic of China, with full and equal rights. The important task of our current ethnic work is to strive to develop the economy and culture of all minority ethnic groups, so that they can join the ranks of advanced ethnic groups in a short period of time and work together to build a prosperous and happy socialist country.

In the past eight years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao Zedong, with the brotherly help of the great Han people and the close unity and joint efforts of all ethnic groups, the production of industry, agriculture and animal husbandry in the minority areas has achieved brilliant achievements, and the material life of all ethnic groups has been significantly improved. In addition to this, great progress has also been made in cultural construction. Taking the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as an example, the number of primary school students is now double that before liberation, and the number of middle school and university students has increased by 8.8 times. In order to more effectively develop the cultural undertakings of all minority ethnic groups, the Institute of Minority Languages of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the State Nationalities Affairs Commission and the Central Institute for Nationalities and other units have sent many scholars and experts in language and history to the minority areas, and they have conducted academic surveys among the people of forty ethnic groups for several years. Experts and scholars from the great friendly country of the Soviet Union have also given us great help in this work, and we have achieved very significant results.

The promulgation of the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme will first of all greatly facilitate further mutual unity and communication among the people of all ethnic groups in our country. Among the fifty or so ethnic languages in our country, Chinese plays the role of a common language among the people of all ethnic groups in our country. With the development of the politics, economy and culture of all ethnic groups, Chinese vocabulary is being imported into the languages of all ethnic groups in batches, thus greatly enriching the languages of all ethnic groups and promoting their development and improvement. For example, the Chinese words "Chairman," "Premier," "Minister," "Communist Party," "Broadcasting," "Factory," "Cooperative," "Telephone," "Telegram," "Department Store," "Professor," and "Hospital" have today become common vocabulary for many ethnic groups. The formulation and universal promotion of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme will make it more convenient for minority languages to input Chinese vocabulary.

In order to develop, prosper and improve their own politics, economy and culture, and to eliminate the backwardness in this respect, in order to achieve de facto equality, all minority ethnic groups must first learn from the advanced Han people who have a long history in all aspects of politics, economy and culture. Therefore, in all ethnic groups, in addition to developing and using their own languages and scripts, actively promoting the learning of the language and script of the Han nationality has great significance. However, Chinese characters are very difficult to learn and are not easily mastered by the broad masses of working people, especially for minority ethnic groups, Chinese characters are even more difficult to overcome. The promulgation of the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has created extremely favorable conditions for the people of minority ethnic groups to quickly master Chinese and further learn Chinese characters. Therefore, the promulgation of the draft is a great happy event that all minority ethnic groups have been eagerly awaiting.

Secondly, the promulgation of the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme will greatly facilitate the creation and reform of the languages of the minority ethnic groups in our country. Among the minority ethnic groups in our country, some ethnic groups do not yet have their own languages and urgently need to be created; other ethnic groups have their own languages, but need to be reformed. We have designed sixteen minority language schemes based on the Latin alphabet, and have helped some ethnic groups with existing languages to reform their languages. The promulgation of the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme provides a common basis for the creation and reform of the languages of all ethnic groups, and will therefore greatly promote the work of creating and reforming the languages of all ethnic groups. As pointed out in the "Explanation on the Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" by the Chinese Language Reform Committee: "When minority ethnic groups in our country create and reform their own ethnic languages, they can take the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme as a common basis, and can use it to directly learn Chinese, which is conducive to mutual learning and communication among the people of all ethnic groups." In the future, the creation and reform of languages by minority ethnic groups in our country should, in principle, adopt the Latin alphabet, and strive to be consistent with the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme in the pronunciation and usage of the letters. With the formulation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, if all ethnic groups in our country combine their own language systems with the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, then it is obvious that this will be conducive to further consolidating the political, economic and cultural ties between the people of all ethnic groups in our country, and the politics, economy and culture of all minority ethnic groups will also be developed and improved more rapidly as a result.

The promulgation of the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is not only supported by the broad masses of the Han people, but also enthusiastically supported by all minority ethnic groups in our country, because it opens up a path of friendly cooperation and common progress for all ethnic groups. In the future, it will make the relations between all ethnic groups closer and more united, and the ethnic culture with socialism as its content can be developed and improved more rapidly. Therefore, I express my heartfelt support for the promulgation of the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, and wish it a smooth implementation among the people of all ethnic groups in the future.

    有利于各族人民互相学习的工具
    包尔汉
    汉语拼音方案草案已经国务院公布，并将提交全国人民代表大会讨论和批准。这个草案的公布，对于全国人民是一件具有历史意义的大事，同时也是我国各少数民族热烈盼望已久的一件大事。这个草案的公布，对于我国各族人民之间的进一步互相学习和沟通以及对于少数民族文字的创造和改革，都将发生积极的影响。
    我国是一个多民族的国家，各民族都有自己的历史和文化，在祖国的缔造和发展上都尽过自己的光荣责任。不过由于过去历代反动统治者长期的民族压迫，造成了历史上多次的民族仇杀，因而各少数民族经济日益贫困，文化日益落后。自从伟大的中华人民共和国成立之日起，有将近五十个民族在党的马克思列宁主义的民族政策光辉照耀下，已经永远摆脱了民族压迫，成为伟大的中华人民共和国友爱合作的大家庭中拥有充分平等权利的成员。我们当前民族工作的重要任务就是努力发展各少数民族的经济、文化，使之能在短期间内，跻于先进民族的行列，共同为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    八年来，在中国共产党、各族人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，伟大汉族人民兄弟般的帮助和各族人民亲密团结共同努力下，在少数民族地区除了工农牧业生产获得辉煌成就，各族人民物质生活获得显著提高外，在文化建设方面也有了很大发展。仅就新疆维吾尔自治区来看，小学生现在比解放前增加了一倍，中学和大学学生增加了八点八倍。为了更有效地发展各少数民族的文化事业，中国科学院少数民族语言研究所、中央民族事务委员会和中央民族学院等单位派遣了语言历史方面的许多学者和专家们到少数民族地区去，他们几年来在四十个民族人民中间进行了学术性的调查。在这一项工作上，从伟大友邦苏联前来的专家学者们也给予我们很大的帮助，我们已取得了非常重大的成绩。
    汉语拼音方案草案的公布，首先将大大有利于我国各族人民之间的进一步互相团结和互相沟通。在我国的五十种左右的民族语言中，汉语起着我国各族人民之间的共同语的作用。随着各民族政治、经济和文化的发展，汉语词汇正在成批地输入到各个民族语言中去，因而大大丰富了各民族的语言，并且促进了它们的发展和提高。例如汉语中的“主席”“总理”“部长”“共产党”“广播”“工厂”“合作社”“电话”“电报”“百货公司”“教授”“医院”等词，今天已经成为许多民族的共同词汇。汉语拼音方案的制定和普遍的推广，将使少数民族文字输入汉语词汇更加便利。
    各少数民族为了发展、繁荣和提高本民族的政治、经济和文化，消除这方面的落后状态，以达到事实上的平等，首先要向在政治、经济和文化各方面具有悠久历史的先进的汉族人民学习。因此，在各民族中，除了发展和使用本民族的语言文字外，积极提倡学习汉族的语言文字，具有重大的意义。但是，汉字很难学习，不容易为广大劳动人民所掌握，特别对于少数民族来说，汉字更是不容易克服的困难。汉语拼音方案草案的公布，为少数民族人民迅速掌握汉语和进一步学习汉字，创造了极为有利的条件。因此，草案的公布正是各少数民族热烈盼望的一件大喜事。
    其次，汉语拼音方案草案的公布，将大大有利于我国少数民族文字的创制和改革工作。在我国少数民族中，一部分民族尚无自己的文字，亟待创制；另外一些民族虽有自己的文字，但需要改革。我们已经设计了十六种以拉丁字母为基础的少数民族文字方案，并帮助已有文字的一些民族进行了文字改革。汉语拼音方案草案的公布，为各民族创造和改革文字提供了一个共同的基础，因而将大大促进各民族的文字创制和改革的工作。正如中国文字改革委员会“关于汉语拼音方案草案的说明”中所指出的：“我国少数民族在创制和改革自己的民族文字的时候，可以把汉语拼音方案作为共同的基础，并且可以利用它来直接学习汉语，这就有利于各族人民之间的互相学习和沟通。”今后我国少数民族创制和改革文字，原则上应该采用拉丁字母，并且在字母的读音和用法上尽量跟汉语拼音方案取得一致。随着汉语拼音方案的制定，如果我国所有的民族把自己的文字系统和汉语拼音方案相结合，那么很显然，这将有利于进一步巩固我国各族人民之间在政治、经济和文化方面的联系，各少数民族的政治、经济和文化也将因而得到更快的发展和提高。
    汉语拼音方案草案的公布，不仅为汉族广大人民所拥护，也为我国各少数民族所热烈拥护，因为它给各民族开辟了友爱合作共同前进的道路。今后它将会使各民族关系更加亲密团结，以社会主义为内容的民族文化更能迅速发展与提高。因此，我对汉语拼音方案草案的公布表示衷心的拥护，并且预祝它今后在各族人民中顺利推行。
