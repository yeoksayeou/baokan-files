Leeches

Recently, I was chatting with several comrades who were preparing to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor. When talking about the areas to be assigned to, they were determined to go to rice-growing areas, but they were also a little apprehensive because there were "leeches" in the fields, and they were afraid.

Are leeches scary? No, not at all. Not only are they not scary, but they are also somewhat lovable, because they can cure our diseases.

As early as in ancient China, leeches were a useful medicine. The oldest pharmacopoeia in our country, the "Shen Nong's Materia Medica," has such a record: "Leeches, with a salty and neutral taste, mainly dispel evil blood and瘀 blood..." Leech is the leech. The method of using it by traditional Chinese medicine is to dry it in the sun and use it as medicine, while folk remedies use it alive. Some cases of "malignant sores and carbuncles" that I have personally experienced were treated by putting live leeches (the hungrier the better) in a bamboo tube and turning it upside down around the malignant sore, letting it suck out all the evil blood, and the patient gradually recovered.

Modern medicine has greatly expanded the scope of using leeches to treat diseases, calling it "leech therapy." The treatment method is basically the same as the folk remedy. Currently, one of the most troublesome and dangerous symptoms in clinical medicine is cerebral hemorrhage. Because the brain is the location of higher nerve centers, it is difficult to perform surgery and no "special medicine" can be found, so symptomatic treatment is very important. When cerebral hemorrhage leads to excessive intracranial pressure, leech therapy can have a certain effect. The commonly used parts for leeches are behind the ear at the mastoid process, under the occipital bone at the neck, and at the coccyx. The method is to first wash the skin of the area to be used, then rub the skin to make it congested, or apply some sugar water to induce leech suction, and then use six to eight leeches to suck for half an hour to an hour to achieve the purpose of treatment. In addition, leech therapy is also often used for myocardial infarction, venous thrombosis, liver congestion, and encephalitis B.

In the Soviet Union, some specialized hospitals also often raise thousands of leeches for medical treatment.

So, what are ordinary people afraid of when it comes to leeches? They are afraid that it will silently attach to your skin. You only feel itchy, and when you lift your foot and take a look, oh, a small, dirty-colored, soft, wriggling worm is crawling on your leg, firmly, which is really a bit creepy and disgusting.

In fact, leeches grow more in places that are perennial silt and swamp. Although they can also be found in rice fields in the south, there are not many. It is possible to encounter them when working barefoot in the fields or diverting water for irrigation. If it crawls on your body, you can calmly shake it off; the best way is to sprinkle some salt or a few drops of salt water on it, and it will shrink into a ball and fall off automatically. If your skin has been sucked by it, it doesn't matter, the suction wound will coagulate in a while; if the suction wound coagulates slowly, you can apply some iodine, or put on a layer of gauze and adhesive tape, and it will be fine. Because according to ancient Chinese medicine, folk remedies, and modern uses, it has never been shown that leeches sucking on the human body has any toxicity.

    马蟥

    最近和几位准备下乡参加农业劳动的同志闲聊，谈到下放地区，他们决心到水稻区去，可是又有些惴惴不安，因为田里有“马璜”，他们害怕。
    马璜可怕吗？不，一点也不，不仅不可怕，而且还有些可爱哩，因为它可以给我们治病。
    早在我国古代，马璜就是一种有用的药物了。祖国最古的一部药典——“神农本草经”上有着这样的记载：“水蛭，味咸平，主逐恶血瘀血……”。水蛭，就是马璜。中医使用它的办法是暴干入药，民间疗法却是用活的。笔者所亲历的一些“恶疮毒痈”的病例，便是用竹筒装活马璜（马璜越饿越好）倒转在恶疮周围，让它吮尽恶血，病人因而逐渐痊愈。
    现代医学使用马蟥治病的范围已大为扩大，称为“水蛭疗法”，医疗方法则同民间疗法基本相同。目前临床医学中最感到头痛的一种惊险症状是脑出血，因为脑部是高级神经部位所在，既难以动手术又找不到“特效药”，所以对症疗法就显得非常重要了。当脑出血以致颅内压过高的时候，用水蛭疗法就具有一定效果。通常使用水蛭的部位是在耳后乳突部，枕骨下颈部，以及尾骨部等。疗法是先将使用部位的皮肤洗净，再摩擦皮肤使之充血，或抹上一些糖水以便引起水蛭吮吸，然后用六——八条水蛭去吮吸半小时至一小时，就可达到治疗目的。此外，如心肌梗塞、静脉栓塞、肝淤血以及乙型脑炎等，也常采用水蛭疗法。
    在苏联，有一些专门医院中也常常养着数以千计的马蟥，用来治病。
    那末，一般人怕马蟥怕在哪里呢？怕的是它会无声无息地吸附在你的皮肤上，你只觉得痒痒的，提脚一看，哟，小不点的一条污色的软扭虫爬在腿上，牢牢地，真有些肉麻、恶心。
    其实，马蟥生长的地方更多在常年是淤渚水泽的所在；南方水田里虽然也有它的踪迹，但不是很多。赤脚下田耕作或引水灌溉，是可能遇到它的。如果爬在你身上了，你可以从容地抖掉它；最好的办法是在它身上撒一些食盐或几滴盐水，它就会缩做一团，自动掉落了。如果你的皮肤已给它吮过，也不要紧，吮口一会儿就会凝结的；吮口凝结得慢的话，可以擦上一些碘酒，或再贴上一层纱布、橡皮膏，就一点事也没有了。因为根据古代中医用药、民间疗法以及近代使用它的情况看，从不曾显示出过马蟥吸噬人体会有什么毒性。
