Xinhua News Agency, 23rd Dispatch: Several prominent Soviet scientists recently spoke to United Press International reporters, predicting some of the changes that will occur in human life in the next forty to fifty years.

The President of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, Bakulev, said that the second half of the twentieth century will free mankind from the pain of cancer and other malignant tumors. In the next forty years, mankind can destroy all natural breeding grounds for diseases. Human lifespan will increase, and even people in their twenties and thirties today will live to see this miracle come true. Hygiene is the medicine of the future. Scientists around the world know of more than seven hundred diseases. In order to eradicate certain infectious diseases, it is necessary to eliminate the breeding grounds and vectors of disease. In the future, sports will receive greater attention, and people of all ages, from infants to the elderly, will participate in sports activities.

Academician Wolfkovich of the Soviet Academy of Sciences said that the current level of science and the level of development of productive forces can guarantee enough nutrition for 20 billion to 30 billion people on Earth. Once the population truly reaches this number, the possibilities for production will be further increased. For example, plant growth promoters may allow for two potato harvests per year. Hundreds of new promoters will be created in the future. Chemicals and chemical pesticides that protect plants from pests, animals, and diseases will play a very significant role. If chemistry is combined with physics and technology, it can solve irrigation problems by guiding clouds to bring rain.

Academician Popkov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a high-voltage electricity expert, said that humanity will definitely solve the mystery of converting matter into energy in the next forty years. Today, humanity must dig coal, oil, or uranium from the ground, refine them, put them into furnaces to burn, turn heat into steam, turn steam into power, and then turn power into electricity. Tomorrow, humanity will be able to directly convert fuel into energy without going through energy-consuming intermediate stages. By 2007, atomic energy power stations in the Soviet Union will produce at least 40% of all electricity in the Soviet Union. Semiconductor elements already exist, through which radioactivity can be directly converted into electricity.

Lebedev, Director of the Institute of Precision Machinery and Computational Technology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that scientists simply cannot estimate the many interesting possibilities that electronic brains have already brought to science. Machines have revolutionized physical labor, and now we are conducting a revolution in mental labor. The current five-year plan stipulates the widespread introduction of electronic brains into the Soviet economy, especially in industry. They can guide production work, and perhaps even guide the entire factory.

### 四十年后人类生活将怎样  消灭所有病源病媒  生产能力大大增加  燃料直接变成电能  电子脑将普遍应用

    四十年后人类生活将怎样
    消灭所有病源病媒  生产能力大大增加
    燃料直接变成电能  电子脑将普遍应用
    新华社23日讯　苏联几个著名科学家最近对合众社记者谈话，预测了四、五十年后人类生活将发生的一些变化情况。
    苏联医学科学院院长巴库列夫说，二十世纪后半叶将使人类摆脱癌症和其他恶性瘤的病痛。今后的四十年中，人类可以毁灭所有的疾病的自然温床。人类的寿命将要增加，甚至今天二三十岁的人会活着看见这种奇迹实现。卫生就是将来的药品。世界上的科学家们知道的疾病有七百多种。为了扑灭某些传染病，必须消灭病源的温床和病媒。将来，体育将要得到更大的重视，从婴儿到老年人，一切年龄的人都要参加体育活动。
    苏联科学院院士沃尔夫科维奇说，目前的科学水平和生产力的发展水平，可以保证地球上二百亿到三百亿人口得到足够的养料。当人口一旦真的达到这个数字的时候，生产的可能性又进一步增加了。例如植物生长促进剂可能使土豆每年有两次收成。将来会制造出数百种新的促进剂来。保护植物不受害虫、动物和疾病的影响的化学品和化学杀虫剂将起非常重大的作用。化学如果同物理学和技术结合起来，它能够以导引云雨下降的方法来解决灌溉问题。
    苏联科学院院士、高压电专家波普科夫说，人类在今后四十年内一定会解决把物质变成能量的奥秘。今天，人类必须从地底下挖掘煤、石油或铀，把它们精炼一番，投到炉内去燃烧，把热变成蒸气，把蒸气变成动力，再把动力变成电流。明天，人类将能够不经过耗费能力的中间阶段把燃料直接变成能量。到2007年，苏联原子能发电站生产的电力至少占苏联全部电力的40％。现在已经存在着半导体元素了，通过这种元素，放射能可以直接变成电流。
    苏联科学院精确机械和计算机器研究所所长列别杰夫说，科学家们简直无法估计电子脑已经给科学带来的许许多多有趣的可能性了。机器革新了体力劳动，现在我们正在进行脑力劳动的革命。现在的五年计划规定广泛地把电子脑介绍到苏联的经济方面去，特别是工业方面。它们能够指导生产方面的工作，也许甚至能够指导整个工厂。
