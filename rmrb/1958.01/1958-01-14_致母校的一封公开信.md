An Open Letter to My Alma Mater
Zeng Dezhen

Dear faculty, staff, and students of Fudan University:

I am a graduate of the Journalism Department from 1945. After reading a news report about our alma mater on January 9th, as an "alumnus," I feel compelled to write this letter to you. Let me start with a couplet. I remember a classmate posted a couplet on the dormitory door a few days before graduation:

　　"When we first arrived, we were young and handsome with shiny hair and powdered faces;
　　Now that we are about to leave, we are left with stomach problems, trachoma, and an air of premature aging!"

Although more than a decade has passed, I still remember this couplet vividly. Whenever I think of it, I recall my school days.

At that time, Fudan University was located in Huangjueshu Town, Beibei, Chongqing. The school facilities were very rudimentary. When I went to take the entrance exam in 1941, the examination hall was in a rented house in the town. It had just rained heavily, the house leaked, and the floor was full of mud and puddles. I remember taking the entrance exam barefoot. The dormitories were also rented houses. In the dark and damp rooms, double beds were packed tightly together. You had to be careful when walking, or you would hit your head on the bed. Later, although some dormitories were built in Xiaba, they were still very simple. In the summer, it was stuffy and hot, and there were many bedbugs, making it impossible to sleep. As for food, it was even worse. The moldy and smelly "subsidized rice" was mixed with dirt and gravel, making a gritty sound when eaten. The students jokingly called it "eight-treasure rice."

As for books and equipment, they were even scarcer. Studying and living in such an environment, it is indeed not surprising that many people transformed from "young and handsome with shiny hair and powdered faces" to having "stomach problems, trachoma, and an air of premature aging."

Such a situation is now gone forever. After liberation, I visited some universities, and both the learning and living environments were many times better than what I experienced at Fudan. I often think, how wonderful it would be if I could have been born a few years later and attended today's university!

I haven't been to Fudan since it moved to Shanghai. As an "alumnus," I am very concerned about it. I carefully read all the news about Fudan in the newspapers. But today, after reading a news report in the People's Daily, I was shocked. How could my alma mater have become so "extravagant"! The Biology Department, which used to have only a few microscopes, has now built elaborate "dog palaces" and "chicken mansions." The "dog palace" has sixty dog rooms, all with brick and wood structures and cement floors. The lucky dogs living here have their own bedrooms, beds, and exercise yards, as well as dog care rooms, bathrooms, and kitchens. … As for the flooring used in the "chicken mansion," it is the "tongue-and-groove flooring" rarely used in urban housing. The pigs raised by the catering department also live in houses with brick walls, tiled roofs, vermilion doors and windows, and cement floors. …

After reading this news, my heart could not calm down for a long time. I naturally thought of the life in Beibei, the couplet, and naturally made a comparison: Today's "dog palaces," "chicken mansions," and the "vermilion doors and windows" of the pig farms are like heaven compared to the dark and damp dormitories of wartime Fudan. I can't help but wish these lucky dogs, lucky chickens, and lucky pigs well. At the same time, as an "alumnus," I am ashamed of my alma mater!

The Kuomintang government was corrupt and embezzled educational funds, which is why the school facilities were so poor at that time, which is understandable. After liberation, with the meticulous care and help of the Party and the government, our schools have taken on a new look, and all aspects have been greatly improved. Students can study and live comfortably, which should be very satisfactory, right? But unexpectedly, there are people in my alma mater who have such fanciful ideas, spending the country's money and the people's hard-earned money on livestock, boasting about extravagance and ostentation. Isn't this a crime against the people? Reaching this point in my writing, I have many feelings!

Indeed, some people have now forgotten the hardships of the revolution. They seem unaware that the reason we can work, live, and study happily today is due to the hard work and sacrifices of countless people. They also don't know that every penny of our country's construction funds comes from the people's hard-earned money! It is very necessary for the designers of these "dog palaces" and "chicken mansions" at my alma mater to recall the inhumane lives of the people under the Kuomintang rule (which also includes the lives of Fudan teachers and students). That way, they may be more clear-headed when spending money, and think of the principles of "building the country through diligence and frugality" and "running schools through diligence and frugality," instead of arbitrarily squandering the people's hard-earned money.

I am ashamed of my alma mater for building "dog palaces" and "chicken mansions," and I am also happy that the teachers and students of my alma mater are launching an anti-waste movement. I hope this movement will achieve a complete victory! January 9

### 致母校的一封公开信

    致母校的一封公开信
    曾德镇亲爱的复旦师生员工同志们：
    我是1945年新闻系毕业的一个学生。看了1月9日报上登的一则关于母校的新闻，作为一个“校友”，我不得不提起笔来给你们写这封信。我首先从一副对联谈起吧。记得在毕业前几天，一个同学曾在宿舍门上贴了一副对联：
    想当年初来兮，也曾是油头粉面少年英俊；
    到而今将去也，只落得胃病沙眼老气横秋！
    时间虽然过了十几年，但这副对联我却牢记不忘，一想起这副对联，我就会回忆起当时的学校生活。
    那时复旦大学在重庆北碚黄桷树镇，学校设备非常简陋。1941年我去投考时，试场是在镇上一间租用的民房里，刚值下了大雨，屋子漏，满地泥浆、水坑，我记得我是打着赤脚通过这次入学考试的。宿舍那时也是租用的民房，在又黑又潮的屋子里，密密麻麻地摆满了双人床，走路都得小心，否则头就会碰到床上。后来虽在夏坝盖了一些宿舍，但还是很简陋，夏天又闷又热，臭虫又多，简直无法睡觉。至于吃的，那就更糟了，又霉又臭的“平价米”还夹杂着泥沙石粒之类的东西，吃进嘴里沙沙作响，同学们美其名曰“八宝饭”。
    至于图书、仪器设备，更是少得可怜。在这样的环境下学习和生活，的确是有不少人由“油头粉面，少年英俊”变为“胃病沙眼老气横秋”的。
    这样的情况现在是一去不复返了。解放后我参观过一些大学，不论学习环境和生活环境比起我所住过的复旦来，都不知要好上多少倍。我时常这样想，若能晚生几年读一读今天的大学多好！
    复旦搬到上海后，我没有去过，作为一个“校友”，我是很关心它的，凡是报上登的关于复旦的新闻，我都仔细地读了。今天读了人民日报登的一则新闻，却使我大吃一惊，曾几何时，母校竟变得如此“阔气”起来了！从前只有几架显微镜的生物系，现在竟然修了考究的“狗宫”、“鸡楼”。“狗宫”的狗房共有六十间，一律采用砖木结构，水泥地坪，幸运地居住在这里的狗，都有独自的卧室，卧床和运动场，另外还有狗的护理室、浴室、厨室等。……至于“鸡楼”所用的地板，也是城市居房中很少采用的“企口地板”。膳食科饲养的猪，住的也是砖墙瓦顶、朱漆门窗、水泥地坪的房子。……
    读了这则新闻，我的心久久不能平静，很自然地又想起了北碚时代的生活，想起了那副对联，又很自然地作了一个对比：今天的“狗宫”、“鸡楼”以及“朱漆门窗”的养猪场和战时复旦的幽暗、潮湿的宿舍比起来，真是一个在天上，一个在地下了。我不禁为这些幸运的狗、幸运的鸡和幸运的猪祝福，同时作为一个“校友”，我也为我的母校感到羞耻！
    国民党政府贪污腐化，克扣教育经费，因此那时的学校设备才会如此之糟，那是不难理解的。解放后，我们的学校在党和政府无微不至的关怀和帮助之下，面目为之一新，各方面都有很大的改善，同学们可以舒舒畅畅地学习和生活了，这应该很满意了吧？可是想不到母校竟有这样的人异想天开，把国家的金钱，人民的血汗在畜牲们的身上讲起阔气和排场来，这难道不是对人民的犯罪？走笔至此，感慨殊多！
    现在确实有一些人忘记了革命的艰辛，他们似乎不知道我们今天之所以能够愉快的工作、生活和学习，是经过了多少人的艰苦奋斗和流血牺牲换来的；他们也不知道我们国家的建设经费一分一厘都是人民的血汗！对母校这些设计“狗宫”、“鸡楼”的设计师们说来，很有必要回忆一下人民在国民党统治时代的非人生活（其中也包括复旦师生的生活），这样，他们在花钱时也许会脑筋清醒一些，会想到“勤俭建国”和“勤俭办学”的方针，而不任意挥霍人民的血汗。
    我为母校修建“狗宫”“鸡楼”而羞耻，我也为母校师生正在展开反浪费的运动而高兴，愿这一运动取得彻底的胜利！　1月9日
