    After finishing reading Mr. Mei Lanfang's "Travels in Japan," I cannot help but recall those old friends in the Japanese theater world who have diligently worked on stage for decades. "Travels in Japan" mentions that during the reception for Japanese dignitaries and overseas Chinese held by the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to Japan at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo on July 16, 1956, the lights in the hall suddenly went out. In the darkness, a tall man walked up to Mr. Mei Lanfang and said, "...Rest assured, I am here with you, it's alright." This was Chida Koreya, the famous Japanese actor who always cared for Mr. Mei and firmly protected him. Twenty years ago, we jointly mourned the death of Lu Xun in Tokyo under the encirclement of Japanese police and Kuomintang secret agents, and also jointly held a memorial performance at the Tsukiji Theater (this was co-organized by the Chinese students theater troupe in Japan and the Japanese New Tsukiji Theater, and was performed for thirty consecutive shows). For decades, Chida Koreya has been caring for Chinese theater workers and the Chinese theater cause in the same way he treated Mr. Mei.

    "Travels in Japan" mentions that when Mr. Mei Lanfang and the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to Japan he led were performing in Japan, Japanese theater workers worked day and night selflessly, helping with set construction, arranging props, and setting up lighting. This makes me recall that when we were attending school in Tokyo, during our performances of "Five Kui Bridge" (by Hong Shen), "Flood" (by Tian Han), "Thunderstorm" (by Cao Yu), "Resurrection" (adapted by Tian Han), and "Children" (original by Gorky), Japanese theater friends not only helped and supported us with lighting, props, and scenery, but also guided us in makeup and effects. I can appreciate the meaning of what "Travels in Japan" says, that one of the main reasons for the success of the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to Japan's performances was the help and support from friends from all walks of life in Japan. I remember very well that when we performed plays in Tokyo twenty years ago, we were all making our debut, with no stage experience and even less acting skills, merely a group of theater enthusiasts. Japanese audiences could not understand our language, and our acting was so naive, but every show was always full. The Japanese audience's love for Chinese drama is probably hard to imagine for friends who have never been to Japan. When a world-renowned actor like Mei Lanfang visits Japan for performances, he will definitely receive an unprecedentedly warm welcome from the Japanese audience.

    Mr. Mei Lanfang had not performed in Japan for thirty years. This time, he performed for the broad masses of the Japanese people in a planned way, and the Japanese audience was amazed by Mr. Mei's artistic progress over the past thirty years. They saw that Peking Opera had made great progress in scripts, directing, acting, costumes, props, and makeup. Even the extras and palace maids were acting seriously, making them believe in the lofty collectivist spirit of the Chinese people who have stood up. The Japanese audience saw that the sixty-two-year-old Mei Lanfang could perform as well as a young man, and was getting younger the more he performed, making them believe in the happiness and joy of the Chinese people's lives.

    Mr. Mei's love and hate for the Japanese people and Japanese imperialism are clear. Mr. Mei took pains to travel across the ocean to perform for the Japanese people at the age of sixty-two, but when Japanese imperialism invaded our motherland's territory and rode on the heads of the Chinese people, he "stopped performing and grew a beard" to fight the enemy stubbornly. This is the reason why Mr. Mei is doubly respected by the Chinese and Japanese people. Mr. Mei's performances in Japan this time received warm receptions, strong support, and infinite care and encouragement from the Japanese literary and art circles, industrial circles, press circles, and the broad masses of the Japanese people, which precisely demonstrates the sincere and profound friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people.

    The friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people is gradually strengthened through the exchanges between the theatrical circles of the two countries. Mei Lanfang, who performed in Japan in 1956, signed a joint statement on December 16, 1957, on behalf of the Chinese Dramatists Association and the Japanese Dramatists Association: believing that cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese peoples greatly contribute to deepening mutual friendship and understanding. Personally, Mei Lanfang's "Travels in Japan" deeply evoked my memories of the infinitely deep friendship between me and the Japanese people and Japanese friends.

    看了梅兰芳的“东游记”
    陈北鸥
    看完了梅兰芳先生的“东游记”，使我不能不忆起那些辛勤地在舞台上劳动着几十年的日本戏剧界的老朋友。“东游记”里谈到在1956年7月16日中国访日京剧代表团在东京帝国饭店招待日本各界名流和侨胞，举行话剧酒会的时候，大厅的电灯突然全部熄灭，在一片漆黑中有一位高大的汉子从黑暗里走到梅兰芳先生面前，说：“……你们放心，有我在你们身边，不要紧。”就是这位时时刻刻关心梅先生、严凛坚强地保卫着梅先生的日本著名演员千田是也。远在二十年前就曾和我们在日本警察和国民党特务的包围下，在东京共同追悼过鲁迅的逝世，还曾在筑地剧场联合举行过纪念高尔基逝世的公演（这是中国留日学生剧团和日本新筑地剧团共同举办的，曾连续演了三十场）。几十年来，千田是也一直和对待梅先生那样关怀着中国戏剧工作者和中国戏剧事业。
    “东游记”里说到：梅兰芳先生和他率领的中国访日京剧代表团在日本演出的时候，日本戏剧工作者那样夜以继日地忘我地劳动着，帮助装台，安排道具，和布置灯光；使我不能不忆起，还是在我们在东京进学校的时候，我们在演出“五奎桥”（洪深作）、“洪水”
  （田汉作）、“雷雨”（曹禺作）、“复活”（田汉改编）、“孩子们”（高尔基原作），日本戏剧界的朋友们不但在灯光、道具、布景上帮助我们、支援我们，还在化装、效果上指导我们。我是能够体会到“东游记”里所说的，中国访日京剧代表团演出的成功的主要原因之一是日本各界朋友的帮助和支援的涵义的。我很记得，我们二十年前在东京公演话剧的时候，都是初次登台，既没有舞台经验，更谈不到演技修养，仅仅是一些戏剧的爱好者而已。日本的观众既听不懂我们的语言，而我们的演技又是那么幼稚，但是每场戏总是客满，日本观众对中国戏剧的爱好，恐怕是没有到过日本的朋友很难想像的。像梅兰芳这样的世界著名演员到日本举行访问演出，那必定会受到日本观众空前热烈欢迎的。
    梅兰芳先生足足有三十年不曾到日本演出了。这次有计划地为日本广大的人民公演，日本的观众对于梅先生这三十年来在艺术上的进步不胜惊讶。他们看到京剧在剧本、导演、表演、服装、道具、化装等方面都有了很大的进步，甚至龙套、宫女都认真地在演戏；使他们不能不相信站起来了的中国人民崇高的集体主义精神。日本观众看到六十二岁的梅兰芳完全能够同青年一样地演戏，并且愈演愈年青，使他们不能不相信中国人民生活的幸福和愉快。
    梅先生对日本人民和日本帝国主义者的爱憎是分明的。梅先生在六十二岁的时候不辞辛劳远渡海洋为日本人民演出，但是日本帝国主义打到我们祖国的领土里，骑在中国人民头上的时候，他是以“留须辍演”来同敌人作顽强斗争的。这正是梅先生倍加受到中国和日本人民敬爱的原因。梅先生这次在日本的演出受到日本文艺界、产业界、新闻界以及广大的日本人民热情的接待、大力的支援、无限的关怀和鼓舞，正说明了中日人民真诚、深厚的友谊。
    中日人民的友好正在通过中日两国戏剧界的交流逐步加强，1956年到日本公演的梅兰芳在他的“东游记”出版的时候，正代表中国戏剧家协会和日本戏剧家协会在1957年12月16日签定了共同声明：认为中国和日本人民之间的文化交流大大有助于相互间的友谊和理解的加深。就我个人来说，梅兰芳的“东游记”深深引起了我和日本人民、日本朋友无限深厚友情的回忆。
