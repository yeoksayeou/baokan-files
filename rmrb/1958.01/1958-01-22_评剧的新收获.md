Title: New Gains for Pingju Opera

Recently, I watched the performance of "A Gallery of Ugly Characters" by the First Troupe of the China Pingju Opera Theater, and I felt unexpectedly delighted. Pingju opera, which has always been known for its tragedies, has successfully staged a comedy of our times. The play is full of joyful sentiments. People see their own victory. Are those rampant demons, those sinister and clownish right-wing elements, not appearing in our real life as clowns? Their arrogance, insidiousness, and ridiculousness, after the creation of the artists, are they not more vivid in front of our eyes?

The success of the play is related to the director. The director grasped the characteristics of Pingju opera very well. In the use of music, he appropriately enhanced the dramatic effect. Pingju opera's music is rich in emotion and full of life, and it is capable of expressing the different moods of comedies and tragedies. Therefore, when used properly, it can greatly enhance the atmosphere of the drama. Here, the director did not excessively use music to render the dramatic effect; it was subordinate to the needs of the drama. He did not let the comedy scenes be drowned in noisy music, but enabled the audience to have more room to appreciate the characters, which is rare. The lyrics and tunes of Pingju opera are relatively easy to understand, but how to arrange different characters in a comedy without falling into farce or being too solemn and losing the sense of reality is not easy to grasp. It is not easy to make it sound natural and without any awkwardness. The director's arrangement of the overall plot is relatively clear. The arrangement of certain scenes has fresh and unique aspects. For example, in the scene where the male "hooligan" and the female "hooligan" meet, when the male "hooligan" is facing the audience, reciting his speech for the symposium in a serious manner, the female "hooligan" secretly appears at the door as one of his listeners. Her laughter further sets off the male "hooligan's" self-satire. It should be known that the order of the female "hooligan's" appearance is greatly related to highlighting the mood of a certain scene, which greatly enhances the humorous and nauseating atmosphere of the whole scene. This shows that the director has made arrangements in connecting characters and the development of events, which is very helpful for the interpretation of the theme. It's just that the last two or three scenes don't seem to stand out enough and are not as compact as the previous ones, and the condemnation of the several main characters being negated is not thorough enough. But whether this is also related to the play itself remains to be considered.

In this performance, most of the actors were faithful to the requirements of the play. The actor who played the person in charge of the Shanghai China Democratic League, hiding his insidiousness under his hypocritical appearance, his every move can completely be trusted by the audience; this character is a cunning fellow. This is entirely due to the actor's deeper understanding of the role he plays. However, some individual actors, such as the one playing the wife of the professor (right-wing), did not have enough understanding. The importance of the characters in the comedy must be taken seriously. Therefore, if she treats the performance with a slightly perfunctory attitude, it will greatly reduce the audience's trust in this role, which cannot escape the audience's eyes. Here, we cannot comment on how the positive characters performed, because they are obviously affected by the play, and their scenes are not many.

The playwright has given quite vivid images to the main negative characters in the whole play. The character with more descriptions by the author - Jin Ruobing, this political speculator, a deceitful fellow, speaks a lot of new terms, but cannot understand the contradictions of the new society at all, and even develops hysteria to oppose the Communist Party. When he made a fake self-criticism and read his wife's speech incorrectly, revealing his true colors, how pungent is this satire! The audience's hearty laughter is not precisely because the author revealed his essence? For example, here is an actress who came from the old society. If she is always nostalgic for the days of the outdated "neon sign," how can she understand that in the new society, an actress is no longer a victim of merchants but has truly gained the status of a human being? Her ignorance is also one of the sources of opposition to the new society. However, the author lacks some characteristic portrayals of this type of character, especially the explanation of the inner world of these characters is not enough, thus simplifying these characters and weakening the persuasive power to the audience.

I think it's a new achievement for the Pingju Opera Theater to stage this play. It not only educated the audience, but also made a new attempt for Pingju opera. I also hope that the comrades of the Pingju Opera Theater can bring this play to the countryside and the mountains.

    评剧的新收获
    夏静
    最近看了中国评剧院一队演出的“百丑图”，感到意外的喜悦。一向以悲剧擅长的评剧，却又成功的上演了我们时代的喜剧。戏里充满着欢乐的情调，人们看到自己的胜利，乱舞的群魔、那些凶险的，丑态百出的右派分子，何尝不是正在以丑角的姿态出现在我们的现实生活中。他们的狂妄、阴险和可笑，经过艺术家们的创造，呈现在我们的眼前不是更加鲜明了吗？
    剧的成功，是与导演有关的。导演很好的掌握了评剧的特性。在运用音乐方面，恰当地增强了戏剧的效果。评剧的音乐情感丰富，并富有生活气息，富于表现悲喜剧的不同情调，因此运用得当很能增强戏剧的气氛。在这里，导演并没有过分让音乐来渲染戏剧的效果，它服从了戏剧的需要。他没有让喜剧场面淹没在喧闹的乐声中，而能使观众有更多欣赏人物的余地，这是难得的。评剧的唱词和唱腔是比较通俗易懂的，但如何在喜剧中对不同人物的安排，不致因流于滑稽或过分庄重而失去真实之感，这却是不易掌握的，听起来觉得自然而无别扭的感觉，这就不容易了。导演对于全剧的安排线索，是比较清楚的，在某些场面的安排有新鲜独到的地方，例如男阿飞与女阿飞见面的一场，当这个男阿飞正面对观众，一本正经的背诵他将在座谈会上的发言词的时候，女阿飞偷偷的出现在门口，作为他的听众之一，她的笑声，更加陪衬出男阿飞的自我讽刺。要知道，女阿飞的上场先后是与突出某一场面的情调有很大关系，这就大大的增强了整场的滑稽，令人作呕的气氛。这可以看出导演在连结人物与事件发展的手法上有了安排，这是很有助于对于主题的阐释。只是在末后两三场，似乎突出的不够明显，也不如前面的来得紧凑，对于几个主要被否定的人物鞭挞的不够痛狠，但这是否与剧作本身亦有关系，还可考虑。
    在这次演出中，演员大都忠实于剧作的要求。扮演上海民盟的负责人的演员，在他虚伪的外表之下，隐藏着阴险，他的一切举止，完全可以让观众信赖；这个人物是一个刁赖的家伙。这完全是由于演员对于所扮演的角色，有较深的理解。但有个别的演员，如扮演教授
  （右派）的妻子，却没有足够的理解，必须严肃对待喜剧中的人物的重要性，因此她只要稍有逢场作戏的态度来对待表演，就会大大减去观众对这一角色的信赖，这是逃不过观众的眼睛的。这儿，我们无法来评论正面人物的表演如何，因为他们显然受到剧作的影响，他们的戏是不多的。
    剧作者对于全剧中几个主要的反面人物都给予了相当生动的形象。作者笔触较多的人物——金若冰，这个政治上的投机者，虚诈的家伙，嘴里讲着一大堆新名词，然而一点无法理解新社会的矛盾，甚至发展到歇斯底里的来反对共产党，当他作假检讨念错了老婆的发言稿而露出了他的狐狸尾巴来时，这是多么辛辣的讽刺！观众发出痛快的大笑声，不正是由于作者揭露了他的本质吗？又如，这里有一个旧社会过来的演员，如果她总在那里留恋着过了时的“霓虹灯招牌”的日子，她怎么能理解，在新社会里一个演员不再是商人的牺牲品而是真正获得了人的地位呢？由于她的这种无知，也是反对新社会的根源之一。然而作者对于这类人物还缺少一些富有特征的刻划，特别是阐明这些人物的内心世界还是不够的，因此显得简化了这些人物，减弱了对观众的说服力量。
    评剧院上演这个戏，我觉得是个新收获。它不仅教育了观众，而且也为评剧作了新的尝试。我还希望评剧院同志能将这个剧目带去下乡上山。
