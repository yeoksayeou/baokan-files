Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Demands for East-West talks from Western political circles and public opinion are growing louder. In the United States, even political figures who have consistently supported the "Cold War" policy are criticizing the State Department's foreign policy and demanding talks with the Soviet Union.

    The "Chicago Tribune" published an article stating that President Eisenhower's disarmament advisor, Harold Stassen, is trying to oust Dulles from the State Department.

    According to the newspaper, Stassen recently told several reliable reporters that he was asking President Eisenhower to obtain "significant concessions on disarmament" from the Soviet Union. Stassen also implied that he had submitted his own recommendations in writing, despite opposition from Dulles, Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Strauss, and the Department of Defense.

    The newspaper also wrote that Stassen believes it is necessary to convene a summit conference of East-West nations to formulate a program for peaceful coexistence.

    Paul Hoffman, former head of the "Marshall Plan," published an article in "Look" magazine calling for a radical change in American policy to break the deadlock in Soviet-American relations. He also advocated increased contact between American and Soviet leaders, revision of regulations restricting entry visas to encourage people-to-people exchanges between East and West, and scholarships for students from socialist countries at American universities.

    Raymond B. Fosdick, former president of the Rockefeller Foundation and a renowned jurist, wrote in an article published in the "New York Times Magazine" that "Now we sing carols of peace on earth and wish happiness to people at Christmas, but on the other hand, we pursue weapons of mass destruction; there is a sharp and ironic contradiction in our words and deeds...."

    Fosdick said: "The intention to negotiate is never inappropriate, and an attitude of problem-solving can never be considered untimely or unnecessary. ... Some of our European allies and Canadian friends have always felt that the United States' attitude towards the communist world is too tough and irreconcilable, and that we are slow in exploring the possibility of mutual understanding. In my opinion, this inflexible policy is deceiving ourselves. We have always believed that time is on our side. We have not only waited for the deterioration of the communist situation in Russia, but also in China, and a tough policy has been considered the most promising approach. Later, we suddenly discovered that Russia has now become a technological power in the twentieth century. This is a bolt from the blue."

    The "Washington Post and Times Herald" criticized the US government's negative attitude towards negotiations in an editorial. It pointed out: "There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of the Soviet leaders' desire to prevent nuclear war." The newspaper refuted Dulles' claim that the Soviet side should "prove its sincerity." The newspaper said that if the United States continues to stand still or fails to proactively propose some positive suggestions, this will "convince the world that we are afraid of negotiations."

    In Britain, prominent Labour activist Aneurin Bevan published an article in "Tribune" magazine, advocating for a high-level East-West meeting based on the proposals included in Bulganin's letters.

    Bevan criticized the West's attitude towards Bulganin's proposals, saying that Western governments took "so long to drag their feet, and showed such obvious reluctance, and spoke with such bitter resentment" before making a routine reply to the Soviet proposals. He said that if informal probes indicate that there is no possibility of reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union, "that is a very sad state of affairs, and Western governments should only blame themselves for it."

    Bevan believes that the Western countries' response to the Soviet proposals must include: informal preparations for a high-level meeting; proposing a date for the meeting so that relevant representatives can take action.

    Emanuel Shinwell, who served as Minister of Defence in the Labour government, said in a speech in Thornley (County Durham) on the evening of January 2nd that it is important to make new efforts through meetings between Western countries and Soviet leaders to promote disarmament and prevent war.

    British philosopher Bertrand Russell published an open letter in the American "Look" magazine scheduled for publication on January 6, asking US President Eisenhower to hold negotiations with Soviet Communist Party Central Committee First Secretary Khrushchev in order to "frankly discuss the conditions of coexistence" and "seek to reach agreements to eliminate future discord."

    According to the West German Emnid public opinion research institute on January 3, according to its surveys in many Western countries, the majority of those surveyed favored high-level US-Soviet talks and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from West and East Germany. The percentage in favor of troop withdrawals was seventy-two in Helsinki, sixty-three in West Berlin, forty-six in London, and forty-one in Washington.

    In this context, United Press International correspondent Gilmore in London acknowledged in a commentary that the calls for a high-level meeting in Western European countries have become irresistible. Gilmore believes that Western countries and the Soviet Union may hold a high-level meeting this year because, although "the US government may not like this idea, the pressure from Western European allies to hold meetings with Soviet leaders to discuss all issues is now too great to resist," and this demand "will become even stronger in the coming months."

### 美国舆论力促政府同苏联会谈  合众社记者说西欧要求谈判压力难以抗拒

    美国舆论力促政府同苏联会谈
    合众社记者说西欧要求谈判压力难以抗拒
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：西方政界和舆论要求东西方会谈的呼声，已经越来越响亮了。在美国，甚至一向支持“冷战”政策的政界人士，也在抨击国务院的外交政策，并且要求同苏联会谈。
    “芝加哥论坛报”发表一篇文章说，艾森豪威尔总统的裁军问题助理哈罗德·史塔生正在设法把杜勒斯赶出国务院。
    据报纸说，史塔生不久前曾对几个可靠的记者说，他要求艾森豪威尔总统对苏联“在裁军方面作重大让步”。史塔生还暗示，他曾经不顾杜勒斯、原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯和国防部的反对，用书面形式提出了自己的建议。
    报纸还写道，史塔生认为召开东西方国家首脑会议来制定和平共处纲领是必要的。
    前“马歇尔计划”负责人保罗·霍夫曼在“展望”杂志上发表的一篇文章中，要求彻底改变美国政策以打破苏美关系的僵局。他还主张美国政治领导人同苏联领导人增加接触、修改限制入境签证的条例以便鼓励东西方之间人们的来往以及在美国大学内设置社会主义国家学生的奖学金。
    前洛克菲勒基金会主席、著名的法律家雷蒙德·布·福斯迪克在“纽约时报杂志”周刊上发表的一篇文章中写道：“现在我们整天唱祈祷大地和平圣诞歌，并且在圣诞节祝福人们幸福，但是另一方面我们却追求大规模毁灭性武器，我们的言行有着尖锐的、富有讽刺性的矛盾……。”
    福斯迪克说：“进行谈判的意图永远也不会是不恰当的，抱着解决问题的态度永远也不可能被认为是不适时或不必要的。……我们的某些欧洲盟友和加拿大朋友们总是认为，美国对待共产主义世界的态度过分强硬和不可调和，我们在研究相互谅解的可能性方面是迟缓的。据我看，这种不灵活的政策是在欺骗自己。我们一直认为，时间是对我们有利的。我们不仅等待过在俄国，而且也等待过在中国发生共产主义情况的恶化，强硬政策被我们认为是最有希望的方针。后来突然发现俄国现在已在技术方面成为二十世纪的一个强国。这真是晴天霹雳。”
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”在一篇社论中抨击美国政府对谈判问题的消极态度。它指出：“没有任何理由怀疑苏联领导人在防止核战争的愿望方面所抱有的诚意。”报纸驳斥了杜勒斯关于苏联方面似乎应该“证明自己的诚意”的说法。报纸说，如果美国继续停步不前，或者不能主动地提出一些积极的建议，这就会“使世界确信，我们害怕谈判。”
    在英国，工党著名活动家比万在“论坛”周刊上发表文章，主张根据布尔加宁信中所包括的建议来举行东西方高级会议。
    比万指责西方对待布尔加宁建议的态度说，西方政府在对苏联的建议作出惯例的答复以前，“拖延了那么久，表现得那么明显地不愿意，话讲得那么深痛恶绝”。他说，如果非正式的试探表明，和苏联达成协议没有任何可能性，“这就是非常可悲的情况，西方政府在这方面只应该责备自己。”
    比万认为西方国家对苏联建议的答复必须包括：对高级会议进行非正式的准备工作；提出会议的日期以便有关代表进行活动。
    曾任工党政府国防大臣的辛威尔1月2日晚间在索恩利（达勒姆郡）发表演说时说，为了促进裁军和防止战争，通过西方国家和苏联领导人的会见作新的努力是很重要的。
    英国哲学家罗素在预定在1月6日出版的美国“展望”杂志上发表了一封公开信，要求美国总统艾森豪威尔同苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫举行谈判，以便能够“坦率地讨论共处的条件”和“寻求达成协议以消除未来的不和”。
    据西德爱姆尼德民意测验研究所1月3日说，根据它在许多西方国家的测验结果，在被测验的人中大多数赞成美苏举行高级会谈以及所有外国军队撤出西德和东德。赞成撤军的百分比在赫尔辛基是七十二，在西柏林是六十三，在伦敦是四十六，在华盛顿是四十一。
    在这种情况下，合众社驻伦敦记者吉尔摩在一篇述评中承认，西欧国家中要求举行高级会议的呼声已经变得不可抗拒。吉尔摩认为，西方国家同苏联可能在今年举行高级会议，因为，尽管“美国政府可能不喜欢这种主张，但是，西欧盟国要求同苏联领导人举行会议讨论一切问题的压力现在已经大到难以抗拒的程度”，而这种要求“在今后几个月中将更加强烈”。
