    A Good Prescription for Rectification
    Ye Qin
    During this rectification, the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Health Department boldly improved several major issues of public concern: the implementation of a three-shift outpatient system in more than twenty hospitals throughout the city, the participation of many senior medical personnel, well-known experts, and hospital directors who had not participated in outpatient services for many years in outpatient services, and the in-depth work in wards. Some directors even moved to the outpatient department to work. Some unreasonable systems for running hospitals under capitalism that had been followed for decades were abolished! After the implementation of these major revolutionary measures, the appearance of each hospital was immediately renewed.
    Our hospitals are socialist hospitals, hospitals for the broad masses of working people. Therefore, all its work must proceed from the 600 million people, from production and construction, from running hospitals diligently and thriftily, and from the patients, which is fundamentally different from the bourgeois medical viewpoint. The reason why the hospitals in Tianjin did a relatively good job in the rectification is because they focused on the key issue of serving production and construction and the working people, and solved it, in light of the different characteristics of hospitals and general institutions – that is, they are in daily contact with patients and directly related to the vital interests of the masses.
    The key to the problem is to grasp it correctly, but it is also necessary to mobilize the broad masses of employees, especially senior medical personnel, to participate in the rectification work. Only when senior medical personnel and experts are mobilized can the medical system be reformed well, influencing and driving general medical personnel. The Tianjin Municipal Hospitals have also set an example in this regard.
    Serving production and construction and the working people is the guiding star of socialist hospitals. Hospitals that advance according to this guiding star will inevitably be supported and praised by the broad masses of the people. No wonder people praise the hospitals in Tianjin for prescribing a good prescription for rectification for themselves this time!

    一剂整改的好药方
    叶琴
    在这次整改中，天津市卫生部门领导方面大刀阔斧地改进了几件人人关心的大事：全市二十多所医院推行了门诊三班制，许多高级医务人员、著名的专家、多年不参加门诊的院长开始参加门诊，并且深入病房工作，有的院长还搬到门诊部办公。一些几十年沿袭下来的资本主义办医院的不合理制度取消了！这些重大的革命措施实行以后，各医院的面貌顿时为之一新。
    我们的医院是社会主义的医院，是广大劳动人民的医院。因此，它的一切工作都必须从六亿人民出发，从生产建设出发，从勤俭办医院出发，从病人出发，这同资产阶级医疗观点有原则上的不同。天津市各医院在整改中做得比较好，是什么缘故呢？就是因为他们针对医院和一般机关不同的特点——它每天都同病人接触，直接关系到群众的切身利益——紧紧抓住为生产建设和劳动人民服务的关键问题并加以解决。
    问题的关键是抓对了，但是，还必须发动广大职工，特别是高级医务人员来参加整改工作。只有高级医务人员和专家动起来了，才能很好地改革医疗制度，影响和带动一般医务人员。天津市医院在这方面也做出了榜样。
    为生产建设和劳动人民服务，是社会主义医院的指路标。医院按照这个指路标前进，必然会受到广大人民的拥护和赞扬。难怪人们赞扬这次天津市各医院为自己开了一剂整改的好药方呢！
