Hoe Poems
    Liu Guangliang

    "Iron Team Three,
    So capable,
    Model figures on the hoe,
    On the hoe,
    Working happily,
    Next year, grain piled like a mountain."

    Guangming No. 2 Cooperative in Bolin Township, Yihe District, Linyi County, Shandong Province, after winning the banner for being a model unit in the entire district for delivering public grain, immediately投入投身了以兴修水利 and accumulating fertilizer as the center of the winter production campaign. In the high tide of production, in order to鼓舞大家干劲, Iron Team Three created a propaganda form called "Hoe Poems." When they worked, they carried several wooden hoes, using them to remove soil. When model deeds occurred, they immediately composed short poems and wrote them on the hoe heads.

    After the hoe poems appeared, people's enthusiasm became even greater, especially Team Two, which worked even more vigorously. One hoe poem wrote:

    "Team Two,
    So proactive,
    Arriving quickly,
    Coming together,
    Everyone working hard,
    Unite to compete for the red flag."

    Steel Team Four, hearing the hoe poems of Team Three and seeing their enthusiasm, also got energized. Soon, their hoe poems also appeared:

    "Steel Team Four,
    Truly strong, ... hoeing with mattocks,
    Shoveling with iron hoes,
    Working hard on both sides."

    New activists emerged in Steel Team Four, and hoe poems followed closely:

    "Steel Team Four,
    Truly not weak,
    Activist Zhao Kaifang emerged."

    "Yan Chengling,
    Truly heroic,
    Not afraid of the cold when working.
    The northwest wind blows, the weather is cold,
    He's bare-backed and sweating."

    In late November of last year, the entire district launched a突击 production campaign. The Yihe District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on all party members, Youth League members, and agricultural cooperative members in the district to demonstrate socialist enthusiasm. Teams Three, Four, and Five were the first to respond to the call of the District Committee and launched a nighttime land-turning activity. Look! Men and women all over the hillside are working hard. Listen! Songs are ringing out. This is a newly composed song:

    "In October,
    The night is really long,
    Turning the land at night,
    To harvest more grain...
    Turning winter idleness,
    Into winter busyness,
    Everyone showing their energy,
    Striving for a bountiful harvest and joy."

    A large number of hoe poems are spreading on the hillside, in meeting places, and on roads. These poems have played a great propaganda role. Herdsmen, 五保老人, people working between different types of work, and people visiting this village, although they did not go to each production team, learned about their labor situation from these poems. People who sing are happy, people who listen like it, and people who are sung about are even more energetic. The Township General Branch and the Cooperative Branch, in order to further发挥这些诗的作用, conducted collection and dissemination with the help of the District Committee working group. Yan Jingpeng, the Secretary of the Township General Branch, personally experienced the motivational role of hoe poems, so he also sang:

    "Steel Team Four,
    Iron Team Three,
    Strong and brave Team Eight,
    Not so steady Team Six,
    Working fast Team One."

    With the attention and support of the Party organization, hoe poems have formed a mass movement. People love to listen to these poems, enjoy singing these poems, and also play bamboo clappers and strike hoes to accompany these poems. Moreover, more and more people are also composing poems. These poems are a drop of sweat in every word, the true voice of labor.

    ?头诗
    刘广良
    “铁三队，
    真能干，
    模范人物上了?，
    上了?，
    干的欢，
    明年粮食堆成山。”
    山东临沂县凁河区柏林乡光明二社，在取得了全区交公粮的模范单位的锦标以后，立即投入了以兴修水利和积肥为中心的冬季生产运动。在生产高潮中，为了鼓舞大家的干劲，铁三队创造了“?头诗”这种宣传形式。他们在干活时多带几把木?，一边用它除土，遇有模范事迹，马上把它们编成短诗写在木?头上。
    ?头诗出现后，人们劲头更大了，特别是二小队干的更猛。有首?头诗写道：
    “二小队，
    真积极，
    到的快，
    来的齐，
    大家齐努力，
    团结起来争红旗。”
    钢四队听到三队的?头诗，又看到了人家的劲头，也来了劲。不久，他们的?头诗也出现了：
    “钢四队，
    真是强，…………镢头刨，
    铁?扬，
    希里胡通干两方。”
    钢四队新的积极分子出现了，?头诗也紧接着跟上了：
    “钢四队，
    真不瓤，
    出了积极分子赵开房。”
    “颜承岭，
    真英勇，
    干起活来不怕冷。
    西北风刮天气凉，
    他光着脊梁汗也淌。”
    去年11月下旬，全区开展突击生产运动，中共凁河区委会，号召全区党团员、农业社员拿出社会主义劲头来。三、四、五队首先响应了区委的号召，开展了月下翻地活动。看吧！满坡里男男女女，在紧张地劳动着。听吧！歌声响起来了。这是新编出的歌：
    “十月里，
    夜真长，
    晚上翻片地，
    为的多打粮。……
    变冬闲，
    为冬忙，
    大家齐展劲，
    争取丰收喜洋洋。”
    大量的?头诗在坡上、在会场里、在来来往往的路上传播着。这些诗起了很大的宣传作用。饲养员、五保老人、在不同工种之间劳动着的人，来这村作客的人，他们虽没到各个生产队去，但从这些诗里就了解到他们的劳动情况。唱的人高兴，听的人喜欢，被唱的人更带劲。乡总支、社支部为了进一步发挥这些诗的作用，在区委工作组的帮助下，进行了收集和传播。乡总支书记颜景鹏，亲身体会到?头诗的鼓动作用，于是他也唱了：
    “钢四队，
    铁三队，
    坚强勇敢的第八队，
    不不楞楞第六队，
    紧赶紧断的第一队。”
    在党组织的重视和支持下，?头诗形成了群众运动，人们爱听这些诗，乐唱这些诗，还敲着竹板，砸着?头伴奏着唱这些诗。而且越来越多的人也作起诗来了。这些诗是一个字一滴汗，是真正的劳动之声。
