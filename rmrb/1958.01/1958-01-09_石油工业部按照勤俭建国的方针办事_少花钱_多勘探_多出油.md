(Reported by this newspaper) The Ministry of Petroleum Industry, based on the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift, has put forward the petroleum exploration and production tasks for 1958.

Compared with 1956, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry's investment and tasks this year are equivalent to doing one hundred yuan worth of work with eighty yuan of investment. This year, the investment in the petroleum industry is less than in 1956 and 1957, but the work to be done is more than in the previous two years.

Last year, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry strengthened exploration work in the four basins of Junggar, Jiuquan, Qaidam, and Sichuan, and the Ordos region. It drilled 250,000 meters of exploratory wells and more than 100,000 meters of light drilling on more than 50 structures, and also drilled more than 158,000 meters of production wells. In the Karamay oil field in the Junggar Basin, exploration workers discovered an oil-bearing area of ​​more than 100 square kilometers; within the range of Karamay to Urho, two industrial oil flows were also detected; in the Ya'erxia area of ​​the Jiuquan Basin, oil layers similar to those in the Laojunmiao oil field were discovered; in the Qaidam Basin, an oil field with industrial value was discovered. They also explored the southern part of the Sichuan Basin and found it to be China's first large natural gas area. Last year, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry also expanded the first, second, fifth, and seventh petroleum factories, increasing crude oil production capacity by 127,800 tons and crude oil processing capacity by 411,240 tons.

This year, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry plans to drill 350,000 meters of exploratory wells and 130,000 meters of production wells. The regional exploration and regional research work in the five important areas must continue to be strengthened, and the areas where oil and gas are known to accumulate should be further drilled to discover new oil and gas fields. In North China, Songliao, Guizhou, Turpan and other places, detailed geological and geophysical surveys and baseline wells should be drilled to open up reserve areas. It is also necessary to further explore the reserves of the Karamay oil field to prepare for oil field development. In terms of production, this year a batch of production wells will be started in the Karamay oil field in Xinjiang to increase crude oil production, and China's first oil pipeline will be laid from Dushanzi in Xinjiang to Karamay. The Lanzhou Refinery will continue to be built, and a modern artificial petroleum complex will begin to be built in Maoming, Guangdong. In Sichuan, gas-fired plants and gas pipelines for producing carbon black using natural gas will be built. In addition, the Fushun Petroleum Factory and Dushanzi Refinery will also be expanded. This will greatly increase crude oil production and crude oil processing capacity.

In order to implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has decided that in the future, in exploration areas, it is necessary to carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and plain living, build fewer roads and live in more tents. Machine repair stations should be established in central areas to reduce scattered machine repair stations and save machine repair equipment as much as possible. Under possible conditions, small-diameter wells should be drilled with light drilling rigs as much as possible, and the design standards for oil well construction should be appropriately reduced and the quality of work should be improved to reduce investment. In the construction of refineries, the design standards should also be appropriately reduced, the auxiliary equipment of the factories should be reduced, and some unreasonable welfare facilities should be reduced.

### 石油工业部按照勤俭建国的方针办事  少花钱　多勘探　多出油

    石油工业部按照勤俭建国的方针办事
    少花钱　多勘探　多出油
    本报讯　石油工业部根据勤俭建国的方针，提出了1958年的石油勘探和生产任务。
    石油工业部今年的投资数和任务，同1956年相比，等于用八十元的投资办一百元的事情。今年石油工业的投资比1956年、1957年少，但是办的事要比前两年多。
    去年，石油工业部加强了对准葛尔、酒泉、柴达木、四川四个盆地和鄂尔多斯地区的勘探工作，在五十多个构造上打探井二十五万公尺，轻便钻井十多万公尺，还打了生产井十五万八千多公尺。在准葛尔盆地克拉玛依油田，勘探工作人员发现储油面积有一百平方公里以上；在克拉玛依至乌尔禾范围内，还探到了两处工业性的油流；在酒泉盆地鸭儿峡地区，探得了和老君庙油田相似的油层；在柴达木盆地发现了有工业价值的油田。他们还勘探到四川盆地南部一带是我国第一个大天然气区。去年石油工业部还扩建了一、二、五、七、四个石油厂，增加了原油生产能力十二万七千八百吨，原油处理能力四十一万一千二百四十吨。
    今年石油工业部计划打探井三十五万公尺，打生产井十三万公尺。对五个重要地区的区域勘探和区域研究工作要继续加强，对已经探知的有利于油气聚集的地带，要进一步钻探，以发现新油气田；在华北、松辽、贵州、吐鲁番等地，要进行地质、地球物理的详细调查，和打基准井以开辟后备地区；还要进一步探得克拉玛依油田的储量，为油田开发做好准备工作。在生产方面，今年将开始在新疆克拉玛依油田打一批生产井，增加原油产量，要铺设从新疆独山子至克拉玛依的我国第一条输油管。还要继续建设兰州炼油厂并开始在广东茂名建设一个现代化的人造石油联合企业。在四川，将建设利用天然气生产炭黑的火房和输气管线。此外，还要扩建抚顺石油厂和独山子炼油厂。这样将大大增加原油生产和原油处理能力。
    为了贯彻勤俭建国的方针，石油工业部决定今后在勘探地区，必须发扬艰苦朴素的优良传统，少修公路、多住帐篷。要在中心地区建立机器修理站，减少分散的机器修理站，尽量节省机器修理设备。在可能条件下，要尽量多用轻型钻探机打小眼井，对油井的建设要适当降低设计标准，提高工作质量，以减少投资。在炼油厂建设上，也要适当降低设计标准，减少工厂的附属设备，降低一些不合理的福利设施。
