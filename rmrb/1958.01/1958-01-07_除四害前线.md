Frontline of the Eliminate the Four Pests Campaign

    Chongqing Launches Propaganda Campaign to Eliminate the Four Pests
    The propaganda campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene in Chongqing has recently reached a climax. To mobilize the masses to eradicate the four pests, the city held a broadcast mobilization rally for the elimination of the four pests with six thousand people on New Year's Eve. Outside the venue, 300,000 people listened to the live broadcast of the rally. Leaders of the Chongqing Municipal Health Bureau and various medical units went to the streets to conduct health propaganda to the citizens.
    Due to the extensive and in-depth publicity of the elimination of the four pests, many government offices and residents have set off a wave of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene. They carried out thorough cleaning before New Year's Day in 1958 and captured many flies, sparrows, and rats. In December alone, some industries under the Chongqing Central District Federation of Industry and Commerce eliminated more than 45,000 rats, more than 1,100 catties of flies, and more than 660 catties of mosquitoes.

    Tianjin Improves Organizational Structure of Patriotic Health Campaign
    Recently, many districts and grassroots patriotic health campaign committees in Tianjin used holidays to organize cadres, doctors from joint clinics, and middle and primary school students to publicize not spitting everywhere in traffic arteries and crowded areas.
    The Tianjin Municipal Public Health Bureau convened a meeting on the 3rd to improve the office structure of the Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, established full-time cadres, regularly inspects and urges the hygiene work of grassroots units in various districts, and prepares to concentrate its efforts one month before the Spring Festival to carry out the elimination of the four pests, a major cleaning and various publicity activities for the winter patriotic health campaign.

    Guiyang Launches a Climax of the Patriotic Health Campaign
    Guiyang, a rainy mountain city in the southwest of the motherland, is launching a climax of the patriotic health campaign centered on the elimination of the four pests. At present, about 90% of the city's 500,000 people of all ethnic groups have participated in activities such as catching sparrows and rats, clearing garbage, and dredging ditches. Various government offices, schools, factories, mines, and residential sections in the city have also launched competitions for the elimination of the four pests and the promotion of hygiene. All units have basically achieved daily small cleaning once and weekly major cleaning once, so that the interior and exterior are always kept clean. Many units have also specially organized commando teams to actively carry out activities to eliminate the four pests and clean up on Sundays and holidays. (Xinhua News Agency Special)

    Removing the "Garbage Dump" Label
    During the rectification process, the organs in Guanzhuang criticized the phenomenon of "free kingdom" and re-established and strengthened the institutions under the unified leadership of various units. Afterwards, a winter patriotic health campaign of unprecedented scale was successfully launched. The entire Guanzhuang was boiling, with men, women, old and young, and employees' families all vying to participate in the elimination of the four pests and the major cleaning. Slogans could be seen everywhere, and children's voices could be heard promoting the campaign. The label of Guanzhuang as a former "garbage dump" has been removed. (Chen Lijian)
