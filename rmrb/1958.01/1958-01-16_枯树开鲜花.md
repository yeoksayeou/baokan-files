　　At the Gansu Province Science and Technology Exhibition, there are a number of brightly colored woolen fabrics and blankets. The guide pointed to one of the colorful plaid blankets and said to the audience: "These new products are of a quality that fully meets export standards and are already selling well abroad. However, such high-quality products are woven using machines bought from abroad during the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty."

　　The factory that manufactures these products is the Northwest Wool Textile Factory, located on the north bank of the Yellow River in Lanzhou. This factory is a dilapidated small factory left over from before liberation, equipped with old-fashioned machines. Its products were once called "gunny sacks" in the market. In recent years, the workers have repaired and put into production the scrapped old machines from the Qing Dynasty and expanded the factory using old materials, implementing the spirit of running the enterprise diligently and thriftily. The state only allocated some scrapped machines, valued at just over 20,000 yuan, as investment. Now the factory's annual output has increased from 50,000 meters of "gunny sacks" before liberation to 280,000 meters of high-quality uniform cloth, and it also produces more than 30 new patterns and varieties such as herringbone twill, camel-colored blankets, and printed blankets.

　　Walking into the No. 2 combing and spinning workshop of this factory, you can see two strange-looking combing machines and a spinning machine operating rhythmically. These are the earliest combing and spinning machines in China, ordered from abroad by Zuo Zongtang when he was preparing to establish the Lanzhou Wool Weaving Bureau during the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. After liberation, the Lanzhou Wool Weaving Bureau was forced to close because the machines were too old to continue production, and some of the workers transferred to the Northwest Wool Textile Factory. The leaders of the Northwest Wool Textile Factory, knowing about these old machines, consulted with the workers and applied to the Gansu Provincial Department of Industry to have them transferred to develop production. At that time, most of the teeth of the machines had fallen out, and those that remained had been worn smooth. The wooden drive wheel was out of round, and the machines were covered in oil and dust, looking like piles of scrap metal. After the machines were dismantled and brought back, some workers washed them with alkaline water, some were busy designing parts, and some took the initiative to find scrap metal in the warehouse as raw materials and handed them over to the machine repair workshop to manufacture parts. After three months of efforts by cadres and workers, these machines were restarted. Because an automated "overpass" designed and manufactured by themselves was installed on the combing machine, and the wooden drive wheel that had been worn out of round was replaced with an iron one and the diameter was increased, the speed per minute was increased from 105 revolutions to 122 revolutions. Originally, only 50 slivers of wool could be produced, but after the workers came up with a way to modify the flower wheel and grooves, 68 slivers of wool could be produced. In this way, the production capacity of the revived old machines was more than doubled compared to the original design capacity, and they could also produce higher quality products.

　　The combing machine in operation in the No. 3 combing and spinning workshop was also a set of scrapped products that the Lanzhou Wool Textile Factory was preparing to smash and return to the furnace a year ago. At that time, the Northwest Wool Textile Factory saved a large amount of wool, but encountered difficulties due to insufficient combing machine equipment capacity when trying to further increase the production of woolen cloth. So they went through the Department of Industry to get this scrapped machine, valued at 3,400 yuan calculated as scrap iron. Buying a new one would have cost 65,000 yuan. More than 100 parts were missing or broken from this incomplete machine, and it took several months of effort by the workers to repair it. They also transferred broken machines that had been shelved in the warehouse of the Lanzhou Wool Textile Factory for a price, repaired them, and equipped them with "tool machine heads" designed and manufactured by the workers themselves. They are now being used to weave plaid blankets and double-layer thick blankets, becoming the factory's most outstanding looms.

　　The Northwest Wool Textile Factory originally did not have machine dyeing equipment and could not weave beautiful and colorful plaid blankets. The year before last, they sent people to visit a wool textile factory in Shanghai and found a scrapped dye pump in a pile of waste materials, which they bought for 200 yuan. Later, the workers devised a way to make their own dyeing vats, forming a complete set of wool dyeing equipment.

　　When people in Shanghai, Shenyang, Beijing and other places see the beautiful woolen fabrics produced by this factory, who would have thought that these were flowers blooming from such old and broken machines? (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    枯树开鲜花
    在甘肃省科学技术展览会上，有一批颜色鲜艳的呢料和毛毯。解说员指着其中一种彩色方格毛毯向观众说：“这批新产品，质量完全合乎出口标准，已经畅销国外。然而，这样高贵的产品却是用清朝光绪年间从外国买来的机器织造的。”
    制造这些产品的工厂是座落在兰州黄河北岸的西北毛纺织厂。这座工厂是一座解放前遗留下来的破烂不堪的小工厂，装备的都是旧式机器，过去的产品在市场上被叫做“麻袋布”。这几年来，职工们把已经报废的清朝的旧机器修复投入生产，并且利用旧材料进行扩建，贯彻了勤俭办企业的精神。国家只拨给了一些报废的机器，折价两万多元作为投资。现在这个厂的年产量已从解放前的五万公尺“麻袋布”，增加到二十八万公尺上等制服呢，并生产了人字呢、驼色毛毯、印花毛毯等三十多种新的花色品种。
    走进这个工厂的梳纺车间二部，可以看到有两套样子古怪的梳毛机和一套纺机在有节奏地运转着。这就是清朝光绪年间，左宗棠筹办兰州织呢局时向外国订购的我国最早的梳纺机械。解放以后，那座兰州织呢局因为机器过旧无法继续生产，被迫关闭，一部分工人就转到西北毛纺织厂工作。西北毛纺织厂领导上知道有这些旧机器，就和职工商议，向甘肃省工业厅申请把它们调拨来，发展生产。当时机器的牙齿多半掉了，没掉的也已磨光，木做的主动轮已经磨偏，机器上满是油污灰尘，简直像一堆废铜烂铁。机器拆回后，有的职工就用碱水清洗，有的忙着设计部件，有的主动到库房里找出废铜烂铁来做原料，交给机修车间制造零件。经过干部和工人三个月的努力，这些机器又重新转动起来。因为在梳毛机上安装了自己设计制造的自动化“过桥”，已经磨偏的木主动轮改为铁制，并加大了直径，这样每分钟的转速就由一百零五转增加到一百二十二转；原来只能出五十根毛条，经过职工们想出办法改装了花轮和槽子，就能出六十八根毛条。这样复活后的旧机器的生产能力，反而比原来的设计能力提高一倍左右，还能生产质量较高的产品。
    梳纺车间三部正在运转的梳毛机，也是一年前兰州毛纺织厂准备砸烂回炉的一套报废品。当时，西北毛纺织厂节约了大批羊毛，但要进一步增产呢子却又遇到梳毛机设备能力不足的困难，这样他们又通过工业厅要来了这台报废机器，以废铁计算折价三千四百元，买一台新的却要六万五千元。这套残缺不全的机器，已经丢失和坏掉的零件有一百多个，经职工们几个月的努力才修复好。他们还把长期搁置在兰州毛纺织厂仓库里不用的坏机器作价调拨来，经修理并配上职工们自行设计制造的“刀具机头”，现在正在用来织造格子毛毯和双层厚毛毯，成为厂里最出色的织机。
    西北毛纺织厂原来没有机器染毛设备，不能织造美丽多彩的方格毯。前年他们派人到上海一家毛纺厂参观时，发现那里废料堆里有一台报废的染泵，结果作价二百元买了下来。后来经过职工们设法自制了染槽，配成一套完整的染毛设备。
    当人们在上海、沈阳、北京等地看到这个厂生产的漂亮的呢料的时候，有谁会想到这原来是从那样破旧的机器上开出来的鲜花呢？　（据新华社讯）
