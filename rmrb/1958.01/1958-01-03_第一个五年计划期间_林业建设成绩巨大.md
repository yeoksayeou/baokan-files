Great Achievements in Forestry Construction During the First Five-Year Plan
    More than 10 million hectares of trees planted in five years, equivalent to 33 times the total area afforested in the 35 years of old China.
    (By our reporter) During China's first Five-Year Plan period, forestry construction achieved great success. In the five years (1957 is the planned figure, the same below), a total of more than 10.032 million hectares of trees were planted nationwide, equivalent to 33 times the total area afforested in the 35 years of old China from 1911 to 1946, exceeding the total existing forest area of the five countries of Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, and Italy.
    Afforestation is primarily to support national economic construction with timber. During the first Five-Year Plan period, a total of 4,746,000 hectares of timber forests were planted nationwide. It is estimated that 700 to 900 million cubic meters of timber can be produced in thirty to forty years.
    In the five years, China planted 1,917,000 hectares of special economic forests (such as tung oil, tea oil, camphor, cork, and eucommia ulmoides), most of which are distributed in the south. In subtropical Hainan Island in Guangdong and southern Yunnan, tropical economic crops such as rubber, oil palm, coconut, and coffee have been developed in a planned manner.
    During the first Five-Year Plan period, 1,278,000 hectares of soil and water conservation forests were planted and 690,000 hectares of hillsides were closed for afforestation in the middle and upper reaches of various rivers.
    During the same period, China planted 1,365,000 hectares of shelterbelts. The areas for shelterbelts were mainly in the western part of Northeast China, eastern Inner Mongolia, eastern Henan, northern Shaanxi, the Hexi Corridor in Gansu, and the coastal areas of Shandong, Hebei, and Guangdong. The planned shelterbelts in the Turpan Basin and along the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains at the edge of the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, and in Hainan Island, Guangdong, have been carefully surveyed in recent years and have partially begun construction. After the cooperativization, small farmland shelterbelts have also been widely built in the vast rural areas by townships and communes. In areas where afforestation was carried out earlier, the effect of shelterbelts on transforming nature and stabilizing agricultural production has been demonstrated. In the past, eastern Henan was often flooded by rivers, and sandstorms filled the air all year round, making normal agricultural production impossible. After the construction of shelterbelts, 170,000 hectares of farmland have been protected. The once barren old course of the Yellow River is now an endless green belt of forests, and abundant wheat, cotton, peanuts, and other crops grow in each forest belt. The shelterbelts in western Northeast China have also begun to play a protective role in recent years. The forests planted in the previous five or six years in Changtu, Zhangwu, Kangping, Faku, and Xinmin counties of Liaoning have grown to two or three meters high, and can already block the wind and sand from Inner Mongolia. The sand dunes have stopped moving, and the yield of general arable land has increased by 50%. Some of the farmland that originally produced about 120 jin of grain per mu has increased to 240 jin to 400 jin.
    During the first Five-Year Plan period, more than 1.01 million hectares of fuel wood forests and other forests were also planted.
    In the past five years, 249,000 hectares of logging sites in state-owned forests have been renewed, accounting for 26.7% of the logging area during the same period.
    During the first Five-Year Plan period, the forestry survey personnel had developed into a team of thousands of people. In 1954, with the help of Soviet experts, China used aerial surveying for the first time in its history to conduct a forest resource inventory. The use of this modern scientific method not only achieved accurate results, but also greatly improved work efficiency. By the end of 1957, it was estimated that 5%-10% of the nation's forest resources remained to be surveyed, and the rest had been basically cleared. According to the current survey results, the national forest resources greatly exceed previous estimates.
    In order to manage these forests, management agencies have been established in all important forest areas across the country since 1953. Up to now, there are 969 management offices in the country. In this way, nearly half of the state-owned forests have been taken over by the forest management offices to take on the tasks of forest protection and fire prevention, supervision of logging, and renewal of logging sites.
    In recent years, the broad masses of people in the forest areas have regarded forest protection and fire prevention as a conscious patriotic movement. Since 1956, a great "no forest fire movement" has been launched in most of the forest areas across the country, and many counties and townships with no forest fires have emerged. For example, Jilin Province has 28 counties and 913 townships without forest fires; Hubei Province has 4 counties and 490 townships without forest fires.
    With the development of forest pest control, forest pests have been decreasing year by year. The area of bamboo locust outbreaks in 1956 was reduced to one twenty-seventh of that in 1952.

    第一个五年计划期间
    林业建设成绩巨大
    五年间造林一千多万公顷，等于旧中国三十五年间造林总面积的三十三倍
    本报讯　我国第一个五年计划期间林业建设获得巨大成就。五年中（1957年是计划数字，下同）全国共造林一千零三十二万多公顷，等于旧中国从1911年到1946年三十五年间造林总面积的三十三倍，超过英国、比利时、荷兰、希腊、意大利五个国家现有森林面积的总和。
    造林首先是为了以木材支援国家经济建设。第一个五年计划期间，全国共造用材林四百七十四万六千公顷。估计三四十年后，共可出木材七亿到九亿立方公尺。
    五年间，我国造特用经济林（如桐油、茶油、樟脑、栓皮、松仲等等）一百九十一万七千公顷，大部分分布在南方。在亚热带的广东海南岛、云南南部等地，有计划地发展了橡胶、油棕、椰子、咖啡等热带经济作物。
    第一个五年计划期间，在各河流中上游地区，营造水土保持林一百二十七万八千公顷，封山育林六十九万公顷。
    在同一期间，我国营造了一百三十六万五千公顷的防护林。防护林的地区主要在东北的西部、内蒙古东部、河南东部、陕西北部、甘肃河西走廊以及山东、河北、广东沿海一带。计划营造的新疆吐鲁蕃盆地、塔里木盆地边缘天山北麓和广东海南岛等地的防护林，几年来已经进行了周密的勘测，并已部分地开始营造。合作化以后，在广大农村中还以乡、社为单位，广泛地营造了小型农田防护林。造林较早的地区，已显示出防护林对改造自然、稳定农业生产的效果。河南东部过去河水经常泛滥，风沙终年弥漫，农业生产不能正常进行。造防护林后，十七万公顷农田得到保护。昔日荒凉的黄河故道，现在已经是一望无际的碧绿的林带林纲，每条林带，每个林纲里都生长着丰硕的小麦、棉花、花生等农作物。东北西部的防护林近年来也已开始发生防护作用。辽宁昌图、彰武、康平、法库、新民县前五六年造的林，已长到两三公尺高，已经能挡住内蒙古吹来的风沙，沙丘已停止移动，一般耕地产量提高50％。原先每亩产粮食一百二十斤左右的农田，有的已提高到二百四十斤到四百斤。
    第一个五年计划期间还造了薪炭林及其他林一百零一万多公顷。
    五年来国有林采伐迹地更新二十四万九千公顷，占同期采伐面积的26.7％。
    第一个五年计划期间，林业调查人员已发展成为数千人的队伍。1954年在苏联专家的帮助下，我国历史上第一次使用航空测量进行森林资源清查工作。采用这种近代化的科学方法，不但成效精确，而且工作效率大大提高。到1957年底，全国森林资源估计尚有5％——10％待继续清查，其余已基本查清。根据现在清查的结果来看，全国森林资源大大超过过去估计的数字。
    为了把这些森林经营管理起来。从1953年起，全国各重要林区陆续建立了经营机构，到现在为止，全国已有经营所九百六十九个。这样，差不多一半的国有林已经有森林经营所担负起护林防火、监督采伐、迹地更新的任务。
    近年来，广大林区群众已把护林防火当做自觉的爱国运动。从1956年起，全国绝大部分林区掀起了一个伟大的“无森林火灾运动”，到现在为止已经涌现许多无森林火灾县和乡。如吉林省就有二十八个无森林火灾县、九百一十三个无森林火灾乡；湖北省有四个无森林火灾县，四百九十个无森林火灾乡。
    随着森林虫害的防治工作的开展，森林虫害已逐年减少。1956年竹蝗发生面积比1952年缩小到二十七分之一。
