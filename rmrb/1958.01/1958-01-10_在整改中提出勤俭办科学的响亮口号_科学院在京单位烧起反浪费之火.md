Raising the Slogan of Running Science Diligently and Frugally in the Rectification Movement
Institutes of the Academy of Sciences in Beijing Ignite the Flames of Anti-Waste

(Our dispatch) The institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing are now igniting the flames of opposing waste. "Running science diligently and frugally" is the common slogan of all scientific workers in these units; these research units have taken "running science diligently and frugally" as an important part of this rectification movement.

In recent times, the staff of the various units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the Beijing area have continuously exposed many serious phenomena of stockpiling and waste. One phenomenon is that equipment is bought but not used for a long time. For example, the Fifth Laboratory of the Institute of Physics bought two "ultrasonic generators" two years ago, worth a total of more than 5,600 yuan, and a "interferometer," worth 5,000 yuan, which no one has used in the last two years. The former Eleventh Group of the Institute of Physics has a large number of "multi-head cables" in stock, worth a total of 12,000 yuan, which have also not been used. The Institute of Geophysics bought a "temperature resistance bridge" for more than 10,000 yuan, but the person who originally ordered it was transferred, and no one has paid attention to the instrument since then.

Another phenomenon is that more is bought than used, or the items are rarely used after purchase. The Institute of Geophysics has a "disc calibrator" worth about 30,000 yuan, which was bought more than a year ago, but it is rarely used. This extremely precise machine needs to work under constant temperature, dust-proof, and shock-proof conditions, and requires a dedicated person to operate and maintain it; however, because it does not play a large role in the Institute of Geophysics, it has not been placed in a suitable location. In a laboratory of the Institute of Applied Physics, there are more than 40 electric furnaces of various colors. It is estimated that the daily utilization rate of these electric furnaces is less than 50%. One group in the Institute of Chemistry has eighteen "galvanometers," but only five or six are useful; there are four refractometers, but only one or two are useful. Similar phenomena exist to varying degrees in many research units.

Another situation is that the equipment purchased is not suitable at all, wasting the country's money for nothing. For example, a "bridge-type single-beam electric crane" worth more than 13,000 yuan ordered by the Institute of Physics is simply not suitable. The lowest position of the hook of this crane is two meters, and the machine width is two point seven meters, while the height of the room where the crane is placed is only three point five meters, and the width is four meters. Using this crane can only lift objects more than one meter high, and there is only more than one meter of free space, so it cannot be fully utilized. If a "manual hoist," which also lifts one ton, is used instead, it would only cost about one-eightieth of the price of this electric crane. Similar equipment that was bought with a lot of money but is not suitable also exists in the Institute of Physics, such as the "horizontal boring machine" they ordered for more than 61,000 yuan, a saw worth 16,000 yuan, a shaper worth 8,000 yuan, and the rubber cloth purchased specifically in 1956 for more than 4,000 yuan, and so on.

The phenomenon of damage, theft, and loss of instruments in some units is also very serious. According to an exposure by one laboratory of the Institute of Physics, more than 30 pieces of precision and valuable instruments have been damaged in the past year, including thirteen "multimeters," worth more than 2,500 yuan. In the first quarter of 1957, as many as forty-eight kinds of instruments were lost from the laboratories of the Institute of Physics, worth nearly 3,000 yuan; incidents of theft of precious items such as platinum, vacuum tubes, and crystal lenses have also been discovered.

The phenomenon of stockpiling and waste in publishing is also quite alarming. For example, the "Wudai Shiguo Wen" (Essays of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms) to be published by the Science Press is a manuscript of more than two million words. The publishing house had already typeset the entire manuscript, but it was not discovered until after the second proofreading that there were many errors in the text, and it could not be published without modification. The publishing house has already paid nearly 10,000 yuan in royalties for this manuscript, nearly 10,000 yuan in typesetting fees, and has paid several thousand yuan in storage fees for the plate for two years. The book "Ancient Geographical Map" published by the Science Press cost 20,000 yuan in printing fees, but it was found to have important errors after printing and could not be distributed. Comrades at the Science and Technology Information Institute calculated two accounts: one is the "Product Catalog" and the other is the "Journal Title Translation Card." The manpower and materials used for these two tasks totaled more than 6,000 yuan, and the results were all scrapped.

These waste phenomena exposed by the various units of the Academy of Sciences in Beijing have been valued by the leadership of the units. The Institute of Physics held a general affairs meeting for this purpose, calling on all staff to mobilize and further expose problems in the stockpiling, damage, and theft of equipment, as well as equipment supply and management, and other aspects of waste, and to conduct debates to propose concrete and effective improvement measures. The rectification leadership group of the Institute of Geology has set up an instrument group to be responsible for investigating, researching, and solving the problems of stockpiling and waste of instruments. This instrument group inspected the instruments in the research laboratories of the institute and reported the inspection results to all staff. Subsequently, all the research laboratories of the institute conducted a full discussion on the use of instruments, criticized the tendency of departmentalism, and re-examined whether the various instruments had fully played their role; some research units appointed special personnel, and some organized special groups to conduct inventory and registration of all instruments. During the inventory, some units cleared out instruments that had been shelved for many years but were now in urgent need. Under the leadership of the "Diligent and Frugal Science Rectification Group," the Institute of Mechanics held a special forum and established an equipment inspection team to conduct inventory and accounting work. At present, the Institute of Mechanics has drafted a draft of the equipment supply management system and property management system for discussion by all staff, and it will be promulgated and implemented after finalization. Some institutes have also held or are about to hold anti-waste exhibitions. The anti-waste exhibition held by the Institute of Entomology proved to visitors that the idea that "small temples cannot produce great gods" and "the waste of biological research units cannot compare with that of physical and chemical research units" is wrong. The phenomenon of waste in this unit is also alarming and should be thoroughly checked. During the debate on developing science diligently and frugally, someone in the Power Research Office suggested that in the Zhongguancun area of Beijing, the Jin Gongchang (metalwork factory) with a good foundation should be slightly replenished and converted into a central Jin Gongchang to serve several surrounding research institutes. This can save a lot of equipment and is in line with the spirit of developing science diligently and frugally.

### 在整改中提出勤俭办科学的响亮口号  科学院在京单位烧起反浪费之火

    在整改中提出勤俭办科学的响亮口号
    科学院在京单位烧起反浪费之火
    本报讯　中国科学院在京单位正燃起反对浪费之火。“勤俭办科学”是这些单位所有科学工作者的共同口号；这些研究单位已把“勤俭办科学”当作这次整改的一个重要内容。
    在最近一个时期，中国科学院北京地区各单位的工作人员，对许多严重的积压浪费现象进行了连续的揭发。一种现象是器材买来后长期没有使用。如物理研究所第五室，两年前买了两架“超声波发生器”，共值五千六百多元，还有一架“干涉仪”，价值五千元，两年来从没有人使用过。物理研究所前第十一组存有大量“多头电缆”，总值一万二千元，也一直没有使用。地球物理研究所用一万多元买来的“温度电阻电桥”，原订购人调走了，这项仪器也就无人过问。
    另一种现象是用得少买得多，或买来后很少使用。地球物理研究所有一架约值三万元的“圆盘刻度机”，买了一年多，但使用的机会很少。这架极为精密的机械，需要在恒温、防尘、防震的条件下工作，需要专人掌握和保养；可是因为它在地球物理研究所的作用不大，一直没有被放置在适当的场所。在应用物理研究所一个实验室里，光是各色电炉就有四十多个。据估计，这些电炉每天的利用率还不到50％。化学研究所有一个组，有十八台“检流计”，而用得着的不过五、六台；有折光仪四台，用得着的也只是一、两台。类似这种现象许多研究单位或多或少都有。
    还有一种情况是，买来的器材根本不适用，白白浪费了国家的金钱。如物理研究所订购的一架价值一万三千多元的“桥式单梁电动起重机”，就根本不适用。这架起重机的吊钩的最低位置是二米，机宽是二点七米，而放置这架起重机的房间，高度才三点五米，宽是四米。用这架起重机只能把物件吊起一米多高，而且只有一米多宽的活动余地，因而不能充分发挥作用。如果改用一架同样起重一吨的“手动起重葫芦”，只需要这架电动起重机价格的八十分之一左右。类似这样用了很多钱买来而并不适用的器材，在物理研究所还有，如他们用了六万一千多元订购的“卧式搪床”，价值一万六千元的锯床，价值八千元的插床，以及1956年专案采购的价值四千多元的橡皮布，等等。
    有些单位损坏、偷盗、丢失仪器的现象也很严重。据物理研究所一个所的揭露，一年来损坏精密贵重仪器有三十多件，其中“万用表”十三只，值二千五百多元。1957年第一季度物理研究所各室丢失的仪器有四十八种之多，价值近三千元；白金、真空管、水晶镜等贵重物品被偷盗的事件也有发现。
    出版方面的积压浪费现象也相当惊人。如科学出版社准备出版的“五代十国文”，是一部二百多万字的文稿，出版社早已经全部发排，直到二校以后才发现文中错误很多，如果不加修改就不能出版。而出版社已经为这部稿子付出稿费近万元，排版费近万元，存版二年，还得付出存版费好几千元。科学出版社出版的“古地理图”一书，花了二万元的印刷费，但印出后发现有重要错误，不能发行。科学情报所的同志们算了两笔账：一是“产品目录”；一是“期刊译名卡片”。这两项工作所用的人力和材料，共折合六千多元，结果全部报废。
    科学院在京各单位揭发出来的这些浪费现象，已受到本单位领导上的重视。物理研究所为此特召开了所务会议，号召全所工作人员动员起来，进一步揭发积压、损坏、偷盗器材和器材供应、管理等方面的问题以及其他方面的浪费现象，并开展辩论，提出具体有效的改进办法。地质研究所整风领导小组专设了仪器小组，负责调查研究解决关于仪器的积压浪费问题。这个仪器小组对该所各研究室的仪器进行了检查，并把检查结果向全所工作人员作了报告。随后，全所各研究室对于仪器的使用问题又进行了充分的讨论，批判了本位主义倾向，对各种仪器是否充分发挥了效用，重新作了检查；各研究单位有的推定专人，有的组织了专门小组，对所有仪器进行了清查和登记。在清点中，有些单位清出了常年搁置而现在又很急需的仪器。力学研究所在“勤俭办科学整改小组”的领导下，举行了专题座谈会，成立器材检查小组进行了库存清查和登账工作。目前，力学研究所已经把器材供应管理制度和财产管理制度拟出草案让全体工作人员讨论，定稿后即公布施行。有的所还举办了或即将举办反浪费展览会。昆虫研究所举办的反浪费展览会向参观者证明，“小庙出不了大神”、“生物研究单位的浪费比不了理化研究单位”的想法不对头。这个单位的浪费现象也是惊人的，也应该深入检查。动力研究室在开展勤俭办科学的辩论中有人提出建议，在北京中关村地区，把基础较好的金工场稍加充实，改为中心金工场，为周围的几个研究所服务。这样可以节省许多器材，符合勤俭办科学的精神。
