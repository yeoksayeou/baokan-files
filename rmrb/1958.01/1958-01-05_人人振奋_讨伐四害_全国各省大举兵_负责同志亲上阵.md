Jiangsu Cities Launch Fierce Attacks
    (Reported by this newspaper) The winter sanitation campaign in cities across Jiangsu Province, including Nanjing, Wuxi, Yangzhou, and Xuzhou, has been launched.
    In Nanjing, over 600,000 residents have joined a focused offensive to eradicate the "four pests," adopting a strategy of concentrated encirclement and individual annihilation, primarily targeting mosquitoes and flies.
    In Wuxi, starting from December 22nd of last month, cadres from the city and district-level government bodies were divided into fifteen teams, led by Bao Houchang, First Secretary of the CPC Wuxi Municipal Committee, and Mayor Jiang Jian, along with other Party and government leaders. They cleaned streets, dredged ditches and ponds, and transported garbage in areas like Beitang and Chong'an within the city. In just half a day, the city's cadre task force of over 500 people removed 17 tons of garbage, dredged 1,020 loads of sludge fertilizer, dug out 10 catties of fly pupae, filled four depressions, and cleared 100 underground drains.
    The scale of the current sanitation campaign in Yangzhou is larger than any since liberation, with nearly 100,000 people participating, accounting for over half of the city's total population. The entire city has mobilized hundreds of digging teams, beating gongs and drums, going in all directions to mosquito and fly breeding grounds to dig up and kill pupae. The people of the city are in high spirits, expressing their determination to eradicate the four pests within two years.
    The Xuzhou Municipal People's Committee held a sanitation campaign broadcast rally attended by 80,000 people, mobilizing citizens to eliminate the four pests. Collective units, such as government agencies, schools, factories, mines, and military units, all set aside half a day or a full day for leading cadres to personally take the lead in cleaning up dust and dredging sludge. Residents of Changzhou, Changshu, Qingjiang, Taizhou, and Nantong cities, also under the leadership of local Party and government comrades, have rapidly launched city-wide winter sanitation campaigns.

Sichuan Province Launches "Eliminate the Four Pests" Campaign Month
    (Reported by this newspaper) Since Sichuan Province launched the "Eliminate the Four Pests" campaign month in November last year, according to incomplete statistics from 71 counties and cities, over 440,000 rats and over 170,000 sparrows have been eliminated, and a large amount of garbage and sewage has been cleared, eliminating a large number of mosquitoes and flies.
    The masses are highly enthusiastic and full of fighting spirit in eliminating the four pests. In Jiangbei County, 150,000 people have participated in the campaign. In Yibin Prefecture, 100,000 people have formed over 1,000 youth task forces and groups, who, under the encouragement of slogans such as "Wipe out mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows to reduce disease and protect health," "Get rid of rats and sparrows to ensure increased grain production," and "Exterminate the four pests," eliminated over 77,000 rats and sparrows in 20 days. After the masses in Nanchong City launched a surge to eliminate the four pests, even on rainy days, hundreds of people went to the suburbs to catch rats and sparrows. More than 15,000 households killed over 58,000 rats and sparrows in half a month. Over the past month, the people of Chengdu have eliminated more than 230,000 rats and sparrows, and 492 activists and 30 advanced collectives have emerged.

Shanxi Province Strives for a Great Leap Forward in the Sanitation Campaign
    (Reported by this newspaper) In order to further deepen the winter patriotic sanitation campaign, Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City jointly held a broadcast rally on eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene. Over 70,000 loudspeakers and more than 10,000 radios belonging to the wired broadcasting stations of over 60 counties and cities across the province were largely open; nearly one million cadres and masses across the province directly listened to the live broadcast of the rally. Dingxiang County, which was holding a three-level cadre meeting that day, temporarily suspended the meeting to listen to the live broadcast of the rally.
    In addition to a mobilization report by Vice Governor Wang Zhongqing, Vice Mayor Wu Tianxiang of Changzhi City and Vice Mayor Shi Yuru of Yangquan City also spoke, proposing that on the existing basis, Yangquan City would achieve the goal of a "four-free" city within three years, and Changzhi City within four years.
    Representatives from Jishan, Tunliu, and Dingxiang counties, the advanced counties in sanitation work in the province, reported to the rally on the progress and achievements they have made in the patriotic sanitation campaign in recent months, and put forward inspiring new goals. On the existing basis, these three counties have decided to basically become "four-free" counties in 1958.
    Many units stationed in Taiyuan City have expressed their determination to strive to turn Taiyuan City into a "four-free," hygienic, civilized, and modern industrial city as soon as possible.

Most Counties and Cities in Jiangxi Province are Taking Action
    (Special dispatch from Xinhua News Agency) More than half of the counties and cities in Jiangxi Province have launched a patriotic sanitation campaign centered on eliminating the four pests.
    Jiujiang City, which won the national Grade B sanitation model title in 1952, has recently conducted a city-wide cleaning of indoor and outdoor areas, and also cleared more than 20 mosquito and fly breeding grounds. Nanchang City has also conducted a major sanitation cleanup in the past few days. Government agencies and organizations, which have always lagged behind residents, have attached importance to this cleanup, and many heads of agencies have personally cleaned and eliminated the four pests. Residents have achieved full mobilization of households and hands-on participation by everyone. Many dead spots during previous cleanups have been cleared this time, taking on a completely new look. Many resident organizations have also formulated patriotic hygiene covenants to maintain regular cleanups.
    In rural areas across the province, combined with the manure collection campaign, people have also cleaned indoor and outdoor areas and scrubbed various furniture these days. Yichun, Qingjiang, and other counties have begun large-scale environmental cleanups, with farmers proposing the slogan of collecting three loads of manure per person in the patriotic sanitation campaign. In Shanggao County, in this campaign, the past habit of free-range pigs has been changed, and more than 200 agricultural cooperatives have already enclosed pigs for manure collection. After the major cleanup in Leping Town, Leping County, in mid-December last year, the entire town has basically achieved cleanliness everywhere and hygiene for everyone. The town has decided to eliminate the four pests by 1959. (Dong Ying)

Guiyang Citizens in Guizhou Province Encircle and Suppress the Four Pests
    (Reported by this newspaper) A massive campaign to eliminate the four pests has been launched in Guiyang.
    The masses have a great enthusiasm for eliminating the four pests. The Zhonghua Zhonglu Office in the Fushui District has set up task forces, pupae-digging teams, sparrow-catching teams, rat-killing teams, and hygiene teams in each section. In addition to digging up fly pupae near their own toilets, the pupae-digging teams also go to public toilets and the surrounding areas of pig pens and manure ponds in the suburbs, proposing, "Not afraid of dirt, not afraid of distance." The sparrow-catching team gets up at three o'clock in the morning to catch sparrows seven or eight miles outside the city, and does not return until eight or nine o'clock the next afternoon. Over the past 20 days, the Guiyang City's four-pest elimination campaign has achieved brilliant results. The city has eliminated 33,726 rats, 17,452 sparrows, dug up 23,142 catties of fly pupae, blocked 6,812 rat holes, destroyed 2,189 sparrow nests, and removed 26,852 loads of garbage. (Lv Meihua)

Li Ting, Liu Bi, and Yan Xinwen, Deputy Secretaries of the CPC Zhengzhou Municipal Committee, and the responsible persons of the Municipal People's Committee cleaned Erqi Road, Jiefang Road, Erqi Square, and the flower garden. Under their specific leadership, a propaganda team of more than 30,000 people was also organized to conduct sanitation propaganda to residents throughout the city. Yuan Bin, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, Lu Shou, Deputy Minister of the Culture and Education Department, and Zhang Beichen, Deputy Mayor of the Municipal People's Committee, and other responsible comrades, respectively, conducted propaganda to the masses in the Zhengzhou City Administrative Region, Zhengzhou Railway Station, Dongda Street, Construction District, and Erqi Square.

Movie theaters and other public entertainment venues broadcast three to five-minute speeches to the audience during entertainment breaks to launch a campaign in which every household is mobilized and everyone takes action to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene.

Nanning City in Guangxi Cleans Up Streets
    (Reported by this newspaper) Nanning City, Guangxi, launched a winter patriotic sanitation campaign at the end of last year.
    This campaign focuses on improving environmental sanitation and street cleanliness, and prioritizes addressing the dirtiest areas that seriously hinder sanitation. Staff and cadres from all levels of government agencies, organizations, schools, factories, and enterprises, along with local residents, clean the streets together, achieving "three cleans" (clean indoor areas, clean courtyards, clean streets) and "three absences" (no garbage, no manure piles, no stagnant sewage).
    Currently, the campaign is gradually deepening. Some streets and government agencies have already begun indoor cleaning and resumed the "People's Hygiene Day" system. On the first day of the campaign, the Director of the Heping Road Office led all the cadres and residents of the office together to clean the streets and dredge ditches. Seeing the cadres taking the lead, the masses were very motivated, and dredged more than 30 zhang of ditches in one morning.
