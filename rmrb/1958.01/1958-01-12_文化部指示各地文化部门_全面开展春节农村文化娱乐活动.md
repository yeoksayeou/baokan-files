The Ministry of Culture recently issued instructions on carrying out rural cultural and entertainment activities for the 1958 Spring Festival.

The instructions, after discussing the current situation in our rural areas, where the great task of agricultural cooperation has been completed and the agricultural production targets of the First Five-Year Plan have been successfully met, resulting in a surging new production upsurge, pointed out that one of the most important tasks of our cultural work is to mobilize all possible forces to vigorously develop rural cultural work, enrich the cultural life of the countryside, inspire the production enthusiasm of farmers, and further enhance the socialist consciousness of farmers, in order to strive for a great leap forward and a bumper harvest in agricultural production in 1958, and to build a new socialist countryside. First of all, around this year's Spring Festival, in coordination with the rectification movement, the rectification of agricultural cooperatives, socialist education, and the in-depth discussion of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) in rural areas, and in conjunction with tasks such as water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and the elimination of the four pests, cultural and entertainment activities should be fully carried out. It should be recognized that doing a good job in Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities will play a significant role in raising the socialist consciousness of farmers, inspiring their production enthusiasm, and enlivening rural life, while also laying a good foundation for further developing rural cultural work.

The instructions stated that rural Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities should be closely integrated with current political tasks and central work, focusing on in-depth publicity of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), and carrying out mass amateur cultural entertainment to inspire mass enthusiasm for labor and production.

The content of rural Spring Festival propaganda can generally focus on the following four points:

(1) In-depth publicity of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), combined with the ideological situation of farmers, with emphasis on criticizing capitalist ideology, consolidating the cooperative system; overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, and inspiring the drive for a great leap forward in agricultural production; overcoming extravagance and waste, and advocating the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily, running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily. In disaster areas, special emphasis should be placed on promoting production for disaster relief, and strengthening the confidence of the masses in overcoming natural disasters.

(2) In coordination with the rectification of cadres' work style and the rectification of cooperatives, promote the great significance of the rectification movement and the rectification of cooperatives, and the major gains and new atmosphere in all aspects after the rectification.

(3) Promote the great achievements of the First Five-Year Plan, and the future national construction guidelines, namely, on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, implementing the policy of simultaneously developing industry and developing agriculture. Promote the mutual support between industry and agriculture, consolidate and develop the worker-peasant alliance, and consolidate national unity.

(4) Promote that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, that the strength of socialism surpasses the strength of imperialism, and that the strength of peace surpasses the strength of war, and consolidate the confidence in building socialism and defending world peace. At the same time, it is also necessary to heighten vigilance, strengthen national defense, implement the compulsory military service system, eliminate all counter-revolutionaries and bad elements, prevent and combat the restoration of rural feudal forces and capitalist forces, and defend the fruits of the socialist revolution.

All these propaganda efforts should employ a variety of lively and vivid forms that are welcomed by the masses, such as literary and artistic performances, folk songs and dances, drama excerpts, storytelling, lantern slides, broadcasting, cartoons, blackboard newspapers, big-character posters, and exhibitions. It should also be combined with the customs and habits of the Spring Festival in rural areas (in minority areas, respect for the customs and habits of the ethnic group should be given even more attention) to achieve better results in publicity. At the same time, various healthy and beneficial recreational activities should be widely carried out, so that the countryside will present a scene of revolutionary optimism and jubilation during the Spring Festival. It should be recognized that healthy cultural entertainment itself is an important political work. At the same time, only when legitimate and healthy entertainment is developed can bad things like gambling be corrected.

The instructions pointed out that rural production and rectification are currently very busy and intense, and Spring Festival cultural activities must be subordinate to and coordinated with production and rectification, and must be based on developing the amateur cultural activities of the rural masses themselves. Agricultural cooperatives should, under the principle of coordinating and promoting production without hindering production, mobilize the backbone of amateur cultural and artistic activities, folk artists, middle and primary school graduates who have returned to their hometowns to participate in production, and the strength of cadres who have gone to the countryside for labor training, and cooperate with other aspects such as the Communist Youth League, literacy education, broadcasting, health, agricultural technology promotion, and science and technology popularization associations to carry out various cultural and entertainment activities.

The forms of cultural and entertainment activities should be flexible and diverse, paying attention both to promoting new creations of the masses and to exploring good traditional programs and forms of folk art. Within the scope of townships and districts, appropriate exchange performances can be carried out between cooperatives and between townships. However, it is necessary to strictly prevent the tendency of "running the circuit" and taking acting as a side business that delays production. It should be made clear that the cultural and artistic activities of the peasant masses themselves must be amateur and should not develop into professionalization. Rural areas close to factories, mines, and military garrisons can also hold worker-peasant get-togethers or army-people get-togethers to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance and close the army-people relationship.

Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities must follow the principle of thrift and oppose the tendency of blindly performing large-scale operas and purchasing costumes and props, which is extravagant, wasteful, and divorced from the masses.

Finally, the instructions put forward specific requirements for cultural administrative departments, cultural centers, cultural stations, art troupes, and film projection teams. (Attached picture)

    文化部指示各地文化部门
    全面开展春节农村文化娱乐活动
    本报讯　文化部最近发出关于开展1958年春节农村文化娱乐活动的指示。
    指示在谈到当前我国农村正在农业合作化的伟大任务业已完成，第一个五年计划的农业生产任务亦已胜利完成的基础上，涌现出一个排山倒海、波澜壮阔的新的生产高潮的形势以后，指出，我国文化工作的最主要任务之一，就是动员一切可能动员的力量，大力开展农村文化工作，丰富农村的文化生活，鼓舞农民的生产热情，进一步提高农民的社会主义觉悟，为争取1958年的农业生产的大跃进和大丰收，为建设社会主义的新农村而奋斗。首先应该在今年春节前后，配合农村中的整风、整社、社会主义教育和全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的深入讨论，结合兴修水利、积肥、除四害等项任务，全面地开展文化娱乐活动。应该认识，做好春节文化娱乐活动对提高农民社会主义觉悟、鼓舞农民生产热忱、活跃农村生活将起很大的作用，同时将为进一步开展农村文化工作打好基础。
    指示说，农村春节文化娱乐活动，应该紧密结合当前的政治任务和中心工作，以深入宣传全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）为中心，并开展群众业余文化娱乐，鼓舞群众的劳动生产热情。
    农村春节宣传的内容，大体可以着重以下四点：
    （一）深入宣传全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），并结合农民思想情况，着重批判资本主义思想，巩固合作化制度；克服右倾保守思想，鼓舞农业生产大跃进的干劲；克服铺张浪费，提倡勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家的精神。在灾区应该特别着重宣传生产救灾，坚定群众战胜灾荒的信心。
    （二）配合整顿干部作风和整顿合作社，宣传整风整社的伟大意义和整顿以后的重大收获和各方面的新气象。
    （三）宣传第一个五年计划的伟大成就，和今后国家建设的方针，即在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针。宣传工业和农业之间的互相支援、巩固和发展工农联盟，巩固民族团结。
    （四）宣传东风压倒西风，社会主义的力量胜过帝国主义的力量，和平的力量胜过战争的力量，巩固建设社会主义、保卫世界和平的信心。同时，还要提高警惕，加强国防，贯彻义务兵役制度，肃清一切反革命分子和坏分子，防止和打击农村封建势力和资本主义势力的复辟，保卫社会主义革命的果实。
    这些宣传，都应运用多种多样的群众喜闻乐见的生动活泼的形式，如文艺演唱、民间歌舞、戏剧片段、说故事、幻灯、广播、漫画、黑板报、大字报、展览等。并结合农村春节的风俗习惯（在少数民族地区，更要尊重本民族的风俗习惯）来进行，使宣传收到更好的效果。同时，还应广泛开展各种健康有益的娱乐活动，使农村在春节中呈现一片充满革命的乐观主义的欢腾气象。应当看到健康的文化娱乐本身就是一项重要的政治工作。同时只有正当的健康的娱乐得到发展，赌博之类的坏事才能纠正。
    指示指出，目前农村生产和整改十分繁忙紧张，春节文化活动必须以服从和配合生产整改为前提，并且必须以开展农村群众自己的业余文化活动为主。农业合作社应该在配合和推动生产而不妨碍生产的原则下，调动业余文化艺术活动的骨干、民间艺人、回乡生产的中、小学校毕业生，以及下乡劳动锻炼的干部的力量，并且配合其他方面如共产主义青年团、扫盲教育、广播、卫生、农业技术推广、科学技术普及协会等方面的力量，开展各种文化娱乐活动。
    文化娱乐活动的形式，要灵活多样，既要注意发扬群众新的创造，又要注意发掘民间良好的传统节目和形式。在乡和区的范围内，社与社、乡与乡之间可以适当地进行交流演出。但是必须严格防止那种耽误生产的“跑码头”和以演戏为副业的偏向。应该明确农民群众自己的文化艺术活动必须是业余的，不应该向职业化发展。靠近工厂矿山和军队驻地的农村，还可以举行工农联欢会或军民联欢会，以加强工农联盟，密切军民关系。
    春节文化娱乐活动，必须遵循节约的原则，反对盲目地演大戏和购置服装道具等铺张浪费、脱离群众的偏向。
    指示最后对文化行政部门和文化馆、文化站、文艺团体、电影放映队等方面提出了具体要求。（附图片）
