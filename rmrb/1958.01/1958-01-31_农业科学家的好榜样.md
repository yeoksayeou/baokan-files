A Soviet Academician Achieves Remarkable Success as Chairman of an Agricultural Collective

    In the Tashkent Oblast of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, there is a Stalin Collective Farm. The chairman of the farm, Mannanov, is a Hero of Socialist Labor, an academician of the Uzbek Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and a member of the Presidium. He has made significant contributions to the development of cotton planting science in the Soviet Union. 1951 was a memorable year in his scientific life. People suggested that he go to work in a collective farm to study cotton. He accepted this suggestion and came to the Stalin Collective Farm. The farm members knew that this scientist was a diligent person who had done a lot of research on cotton planting, so they elected him as the chairman of the collective farm.

    Under the leadership of this scientist, the Stalin Collective Farm has achieved great success. Although the climatic conditions in 1957 were not very good, the collective farm harvested 4 tons of cotton per hectare on an area of 700 hectares, which is double what it was six years ago.

    农业科学家的好榜样
    苏联一位院士当农庄主席成绩卓著
    苏联乌兹别克共和国塔什干州有一个斯大林集体农庄，农庄主席曼那诺夫是社会主义劳动英雄、乌兹别克农业科学院的院士和主席团委员。他对苏联植棉业科学的发展有着巨大的贡献。1951年是他科学生活中值得纪念的一年。人们建议他到集体农庄的岗位上去从事棉花的研究。他接受了这个建议，来到斯大林集体农庄。庄员们知道这位科学家是一个勤奋的、对植棉业很有研究的人，因此选他当这个集体农庄的主席。
    斯大林集体农庄在这位科学家的领导下，获得很大成绩。1957年的气候条件虽然不太好，但是，集体农庄在七百公顷面积内每公顷收四十公担棉花。比六年以前多一倍。
