The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Diligently Builds the Army and Supports Socialism
PLA Officers and Soldiers Show Great Enthusiasm and Achieve Great Success in Thrift

    This newspaper reports that in the past year, the vast number of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have promoted a high degree of patriotism and a spirit of hard struggle, saving a large amount of funds and materials such as cotton cloth, coal, electricity, and grain. They have also made significant contributions in raising pigs, growing vegetables, and developing sideline production.
    In the past year, PLA units have universally and deeply conducted political and ideological education on building the army through diligence and frugality, practicing strict economy, and supporting national construction. Based on this ideological education, many troops have adhered to the principle of resolutely not doing what can be avoided and postponing what can be delayed, thereby reducing budget expenditures. For example, the Training and Supervision Department, the Signal Corps Department, and other units alone reduced budget expenditures by more than 26 million yuan. In the Guangzhou area, the savings from troops repairing barracks themselves or completely constructing barracks on their own amounted to more than 180,000 yuan. Many units saved a lot of money by adhering to the spirit of doing more things with less money and doing things well without spending money. For example, when the Air Force built an airport in a certain place, they repeatedly selected the site, resulting in the most economical option and saving the country more than 3.6 million yuan in construction costs. In another example, the General Logistics Department, in response to the demands of the majority of military officers, changed the summer uniforms of generals and colonels to plain weave fabric and extended the wear of the winter uniforms of lieutenants by one year, also saving the country more than 7.4 million yuan.
    In the past year, the vast number of officers and soldiers have also implemented the method of exchanging old uniforms for new ones, with the average utilization rate of recycled materials reaching more than 80%. According to preliminary statistics, by the end of last year, the troops had turned in more than 4 million jin of used cotton, more than 3 million jin of used cloth, and 250,000 jin of waste rubber shoe soles. The re-utilization value of these materials is equivalent to approximately 300,000 bolts of cotton cloth, which, at 28 yuan per bolt, can save the country more than 8.4 million yuan. In addition, many troops also used old materials to make special work clothes, saving the country more than 100,000 bolts of cotton cloth.
    In accordance with the spirit of building the army through diligence and frugality, the vast number of officers and soldiers widely used old and substitute products in training and made training equipment themselves. As a result, although the army's training funds were reduced by a quarter to a third last year, the smooth completion of training tasks was still guaranteed, and some troops even had surpluses. For example, a certain unit stationed in the Fuzhou area made more than 48,000 pieces of training equipment themselves last year. The self-made distance measuring devices and slope measuring devices of a certain unit not only saved money and guaranteed training, but also contributed to improving the equipment of the troops. In the past, when a certain artillery unit conducted live ammunition exercises, they always asked carpenters to make tank targets, which was costly and in short supply. Last year, the officers and soldiers of this unit used waste newspapers and bamboo instead of wood and wood silk to make tank targets, which were not only easy to use but also economical, completely meeting the needs and costing only three yuan for the whole year. A certain military hospital in Nanjing washed and disinfected used gauze and cotton balls for reuse, resulting in 83% less cotton and 56% less gauze used than in 1956. According to statistics from several regional hospitals, the savings value of using broken wooden boxes and medicine bottles alone reached more than 50,000 yuan.
    The troops also came up with many ways to save electricity and coal, achieving great results. In terms of electricity consumption, many troops canceled unnecessary light bulbs, replaced large light bulbs with small ones, and ensured that lights were only turned on when needed and turned off when people left. According to statistics from five units in Beijing alone, more than 440,000 watts of electricity were saved last year. In terms of coal consumption, the army universally modified stoves last year, and self-draft stoves were promoted in many units. Due to various methods of saving coal, the army's average daily coal consumption per person has been reduced to about one jin, and many troops have reduced it to eight to ten liang. According to statistics from four regions including Nanjing, more than 28 million jin of coal were saved for the country in the first half of 1957.
    Last year, due to the widespread ideological education on cherishing grain in the PLA units, the vast number of officers and soldiers enthusiastically responded to the call of the General Political Department and the General Logistics Department to save grain. Last year, the army saved more than 54 million jin of grain for the country.
    Under the slogan of cherishing weapons and equipment and maintaining equipment like protecting one's own eyes, the total value of savings last year was also very large. The Air Force saved more than 400 tons of ground fuel and more than 9,700 tons of aviation fuel in the first to third quarters of last year alone by implementing a method of saving gasoline.
    Without affecting the execution of national defense tasks, the vast number of officers and soldiers also universally used their spare time to reclaim wasteland, grow vegetables, raise pigs and sheep, and develop sideline production. For example, the troops stationed on a certain island overcame typhoons and pests, built terraced fields, and dug irrigated land. The vegetables they grew could supply 80% of their needs, greatly improving the lives of the officers and soldiers and reducing the supply from the mainland. A certain automobile unit stationed in Tibet grew vegetables last year that not only supplied their own needs but also supplied fraternal units. The vegetables grown by a certain unit in the Nanjing area can be eaten until April this year, with 250,000 jin remaining to support the local market. According to incomplete statistics, the army planted more than 83,000 mu of vegetables last year, yielding more than 196.6 million jin of vegetables, and more than 6.44 million jin of grains and oil crops. The army raised more than 110,000 poultry, 14,000 cattle and sheep, and more than 250,000 pigs last year.
    Now, the General Logistics Department of the PLA is also preparing to further reduce certain expenses to support national construction. The vast number of officers and soldiers have also further raised their awareness in the rectification campaign and have asked to further reduce certain overly high supply standards and save more funds and materials to support the country's socialist construction.

    勤俭建军支援社会主义
    建设解放军官兵节约劲头足成绩大
    本报讯　在过去一年中，中国人民解放军广大官兵发扬了高度的爱国主义和艰苦奋斗的精神，节省了大量经费和棉布、煤、电、粮食等物资，并在养猪、种菜发展副业生产等方面，作出了很大贡献。
    去年一年中，人民解放军各单位都普遍而深入地进行了勤俭建军，厉行节约，支援国家建设的政治思想教育。在这一思想教育的基础上，很多部队都本着可办可不办的坚决不办，可缓办的就缓办的原则，削减了预算经费，仅训练总监部、通信兵部等几个单位，就削减了预算经费二千六百多万元。广州地区几个部队自己动手小修营房或者完全自己建筑营房的节约价值，就达十八万余元。各部队本着少花钱多办事，不花钱办好事的精神节约的经费也很多。例如空军在某地修建机场时，反复选择场址，结果选出了最经济的一种，共为国家节约了三百六十多万元的建筑经费。又如总后勤部根据广大军官的要求，把将、校级的夏服改为平纹布料，把尉级军官的冬服延长一年着用，也给国家节省了七百四十多万元。
    过去一年中，广大官兵还执行了服装等交旧领新的办法，使物资收旧利用率平均达到80％以上。据初步统计，到去年年底为止，各部队上缴的旧棉花已达四百多万斤，旧布三百多万斤，废胶鞋底二十五万斤。这几项物资的再利用价值，约折棉布三十万匹，若以每匹二十八元计，即可给国家节省八百四十多万元。另外，许多部队特需的工作服，也利用旧料制作，给国家节约了棉布十万余匹。
    广大官兵根据勤俭建军的精神，在训练中广泛利用了旧品和代用品，并亲自动手制作训练器材。因而去年全军训练经费虽然削减了四分之一到三分之一，但仍保障了训练任务的顺利完成，有些部队还有节余。如驻福州地区某部，去年共自制训练器材四万八千多件。某部队自制的距离测量器、坡度测量器，不仅节省了经费，保证了训练，而且对改善部队的装备也有贡献。某炮兵部队过去作实弹射击演习时，总是请木工制作坦克靶，花钱既多，且供不应求；去年，这个部队的官兵自己动手，利用废报纸、竹子等代替木料木丝作坦克靶，结果又好用，又经济，完全满足了需要，全年只花了三元钱。南京某军医院把用过的纱布、棉球等洗净、消毒再用，结果比1956年少用棉花83％，少用纱布56％。据几个地区医院的统计，仅利用破旧木箱和药瓶的节约价值，就达五万余元。
    各部队为了节约电力，煤炭，也想了很多办法，取得很大成绩。在用电方面，很多部队取消了可有可无的灯泡，把大灯泡换成小灯泡，并做到了不用不开，人走灯灭。仅据北京五个单位统计，去年就节约四十四万余瓦电。在使用煤炭方面，去年全军都普遍修改了炉灶，并且在很多部队推广了自来风灶。由于想了各种办法节约煤炭，现在全军每人每天烧煤已降低到一斤左右，不少部队已降低到八至十两。根据南京等四个地区的统计，1957年上半年，共为国家节省了燃煤二千八百余万斤。
    在去年，人民解放军各单位由于普遍进行了珍惜粮食的思想教育，广大官兵都热烈地响应了总政治部和总后勤部提出的节约粮食的号召，去年全军为国家节约的粮食达五千四百多万斤。
    广大官兵在爱护武器，爱护装备，像维护自己眼睛一样维护装备的口号下，去年一年的节约总值也很大。空军部队由于推行了一项节省汽油的方法，仅去年第一到第三季度，即节省地面用油四百多吨，航空用油九千七百多吨。
    在不影响执行国防任务的情况下，广大官兵还普遍利用业余时间垦荒种菜，养猪养羊，发展副业生产。例如驻某岛屿的部队战胜了台风和虫害，修梯田，挖水地种的蔬菜可自给80％，大大改善了官兵生活，减少了大陆的供应。驻西藏某汽车部队去年种的菜除自给外，还供应了兄弟部队。南京地区某部队种的菜可吃到今年4月，还有二十五万斤剩余可支援当地市场。据不完全统计，去年全军共种植蔬菜八万三千多亩，收蔬菜达一万九千六百多万斤，谷类和油料作物六百四十余万斤。全军去年共养各种家禽十一万余只，牛、羊一万四千余头，猪二十五万多口。
    现在，人民解放军总后勤部还准备进一步削减某些费用支援国家建设。广大官兵也在整风中进一步提高了觉悟，纷纷要求再次降低某些过高的供给标准，节省出更多的经费物资，支援国家的社会主义建设事业。（附图片）
