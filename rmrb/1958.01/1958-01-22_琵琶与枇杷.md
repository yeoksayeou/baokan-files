    Pipa and Loquat
    Wu Guanzhou
    The pipa is a musical instrument, and the loquat is a fruit. These two can be said to be as different as "a horse and an ox" [completely unrelated].

    The pipa is made of tung wood. The front is flat, the back is round, the head is slightly curved, the neck is long, and the body is oval, so that it can resonate with the strings when played, producing a loud sound.

    One end of each string is wound around a short handle, which is inserted horizontally into the head of the pipa. The tightness of the strings determines the pitch. The tighter the string is twisted, the higher the pitch will be when played, which means the more vibrations per second.

    In Bai Juyi's "Pipa Ballad," there is "Called a thousand times, she finally appears, still holding the pipa, half-hiding her face." It needs to be "held," and can "hide the face," indicating that it is a relatively large instrument.

    The loquat fruit grows on the loquat tree, which belongs to the Rosaceae family and is an evergreen tree, more than two zhang [approximately 6.6 meters] tall, growing in relatively warm areas. There are many such trees in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, and northerners don't know much about them.

    The loquat leaves are long and elliptical, with wavy edges and very fine serrations. The back has very fine hairs. After brushing off the hairs, boiling it in water, its juice can cure coughs. If sugar is added and boiled into a thin, gluey liquid, put in a bottle, it is called loquat syrup, which is sweet and fragrant when taken with boiling water.

    The loquat tree blooms in early winter. The flowers are small, white, with five petals. By early summer, the loquats are ripe, and they are pale yellow, round berries. The skin has fine hairs, and inside there are two or three large pits. The taste is sweet and slightly sour. The white sand loquat produced in Dongting Mountain, Jiangsu Province, has a yellowish-white skin, is sweet and has no sour taste.

    Someone wrote a prose poem for the loquat, with the lines: "Receiving the clear branches of golden autumn, embracing the harmonious energy of Dongyang; initiating cold buds in frost, becoming fiery fruit in delicate dew." Su Dongpo's poem has "Guests come, tea is finished, and there is nothing, the loquat is slightly yellow and still carries sourness." "Lu Ju" [卢橘] is a nickname for loquat.

    Based on the above descriptions, one is related to taste, and the other is related to hearing. Originally, they would not be confused. However, because the pronunciation of the two characters is the same, some people mistakenly write "枇杷" [loquat] as "琵琶" [pipa].

    During the Ming Dynasty, there was a man named Mo Yanhan. Once, he went to visit his friend Yuan Taichong and saw a box of gifts on the table, which contained loquats, but the gift card read "A box of pipas." The two looked at each other and laughed. Mo Yanhan then wrote two lines of doggerel:

    If pipas could bear fruit,
    They would surely cause all strings and pipes to bloom!

### 琵琶与枇杷

    琵琶与枇杷
    吴观周
    琵琶是一种乐器，枇杷是一种果实，这两者可以说是“风马牛不相及”的东西。
    琵琶用桐木做成。前面平，后面圆，头微曲，颈很长，腹部成椭圆形，这样在弹奏时能与弦共鸣，发音响亮。
    每根弦的一个头，卷在一根短柄上，柄则横插在琵琶的头上。弦的紧松，决定音调的高低。如果把弦绞得越紧，则弹起来的音调就越高，也就是每秒钟的振动数就越多。
    白居易的“琵琶行”里，有“千呼万唤始出来，犹抱琵琶半遮面”。它需要“手抱”，可以“遮面”，可见是一个比较大的乐器。
    结枇杷果实的是枇杷树，属蔷薇科，为常绿的乔木，高约二丈多，生长在比较温暖的地区。江浙一带，这种树很多，北方人不太知道。
    枇杷叶是长椭圆形的，叶边弯弯曲曲，成极细的锯齿状，背面有很细的毛，把毛刷去，用水煎煮，它的汁可以治咳嗽。如果加糖煎成稀薄的胶状液，装在瓶里，叫做枇杷膏，用开水冲服，又甜又香。
    枇杷树在冬初开花，花很小，色白，有五瓣。到初夏枇杷成熟，是淡黄色的圆形浆果。皮上有细毛，里面有大核二、三粒，味甜而略带酸。江苏省洞庭山出产的白沙枇杷，皮呈黄白色，甘美而没有酸味。
    有人为枇杷作赋，有“禀金秋之清条，抱东阳之和气；肇寒葩于结霜，成炎果于纤露”之句。苏东坡的诗有“客来茶罢空无有，卢橘微黄尚带酸”。卢橘是枇杷的外号。
    根据上面这些叙述，一个是有关味觉的东西，一个是有关听觉的东西，本来是不会相混的。但是由于这两个字的发音相同，就有人把“枇杷”误写为“琵琶”了。
    明朝有一位莫延韩，有一次去访问他的朋友袁太冲，看见桌上放着一盒礼品，里面装的是枇杷，礼帖上却写着“琵琶一盒”，两人相视大笑，莫延韩就写了两句打油诗：
    若使琵琶能结果，
    定教弦管尽开花！
