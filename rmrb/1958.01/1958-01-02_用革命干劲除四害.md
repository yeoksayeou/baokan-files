Using revolutionary zeal to eliminate the four pests
Jiang Wang

A high tide of the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene is being successively launched throughout the country. In many places, from leading cadres to the broad masses, everyone is demonstrating a spirit of not fearing difficulties and being full of vigor. This is a socialist spirit, and we must have this spirit in all socialist construction undertakings, as well as in the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene!

We know that eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene is a major event that eliminates diseases, invigorates everyone, changes customs, and transforms the country, and it is the desire of the broad masses of people. In order to do this great thing well and realize the wishes of the broad masses of people, we must muster our energy and overcome difficulties. Many responsible comrades of provincial and municipal Party and government organizations have taken the lead and set an example for everyone. Many workers, farmers, and students have made amazing achievements on the front lines of eliminating the four pests for years. All of this is supported by a socialist spirit. Wherever this spirit appears, we see that the old face has changed and a new scene has emerged. On the contrary, some responsible comrades of Party and government organizations and relevant departments lack this spirit, believing that the four pests cannot be eliminated, and do not seriously mobilize the masses, do not raise the socialist consciousness of the masses, do not improve their understanding of the elimination of the four pests, and do not strengthen leadership. Naturally, the movement to eliminate the four pests cannot be carried out well and quickly. In this case, the four pests are difficult to eliminate, there are few methods, and difficulties are heavy. Why? This is because of the lack of socialist zeal!

Can the four pests be completely eliminated? Not only now, but also many past examples tell us that the four pests can be completely eliminated. Wulao Village in Nanjing City was rated as a national first-class health model unit as early as the 1952 Patriotic Health Campaign, and Qile Agricultural and Forestry Production Cooperative in Lechang County, Guangdong Province, was rated as a first-class model unit last year. They have all achieved outstanding achievements in eliminating the four pests. Moreover, now "four-without" villages, townships, towns, streets... are emerging one after another like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. The masses' methods and experiences in eliminating the four pests are also becoming richer and richer. What other reasons do we have to shirk and delay?

Let us give full play to the socialist zeal, criticize those who do not believe that the four pests can be eliminated, and intentionally or unintentionally abandon the movement to eliminate the four pests, or lack confidence in the movement to eliminate the four pests, take ineffective measures, or shout slogans without mobilizing and relying on the masses. Leaders take the lead, and the whole people act. This will be an important key to ensuring the sustained and smooth development of the movement to eliminate the four pests.

    用革命干劲除四害
    江望
    除四害、讲卫生运动的高潮，正在全国各地相继掀起。许多地方，从领导干部到广大群众，都表现出一股不怕困难，朝气蓬勃的干劲。这是一种社会主义的干劲，在各项社会主义建设事业中必须有这种干劲，在除四害、讲卫生运动中也必须有这种干劲！
    我们知道，除四害、讲卫生是一件消灭疾病，人人振奋，移风易俗，改造国家的大事，是广大人民的愿望。为了做好这件大事，实现广大人民的愿望，我们就必须鼓起干劲，克服困难。许多省市党政负责同志都亲自动手，为大家做出了榜样。许多工人、农民和学生，数年如一日，在除四害战线上做出了惊人的成绩。这都是有一股社会主义干劲在支持着他们。凡是出现这股干劲的地方，我们就看到改变了旧的面貌，出现了新的景象。相反地，有些地方党政负责同志，有关部门缺少这股干劲，认为除四害除不清，不去认真发动群众，不去提高群众的社会主义觉悟，不去提高他们对除四害的认识，不去加强领导，自然，除四害运动也就不能很好很快地开展起来。在这种情况下，四害也就难除，办法也就很少，困难也就重重。为什么呢？这就是缺少社会主义干劲的缘故！
    四害能不能除尽？不仅是现在，就是过去也有许多事例告诉我们，四害是可以除尽的。南京市五老村早在1952年爱国卫生运动中，就被评为全国甲等卫生模范单位，广东省乐昌县岐乐农林业生产社在去年被评为甲等模范单位。他们在除四害方面都取得了出色的成就。而且，现在四无村、乡、镇、街道……正如雨后春笋，一个挨一个地露出头来。群众消灭四害的办法和经验也愈来愈丰富。我们还能有什么理由来推托和拖延呢？
    让我们发挥社会主义的干劲，批判那些不相信能够消灭四害、而有意和无意丢掉了除四害运动，或者对除四害运动缺乏信心，措施不力，或空口叫喊而不发动和依靠群众的思想。领导带头，全民动手。这将是保证除四害运动持久和顺利开展的重要关键。
