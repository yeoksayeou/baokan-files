    Do a Good and Thorough Job of Ideological Work
    Currently, a surge of cadres signing up to go to lower levels to participate in labor training has been set off in many state organs, and everywhere is filled with joy and excitement. The Party's policy of transforming intellectuals has been widely responded to.
    However, have all cadres who have signed up to go to lower levels truly recognized the political significance of cadres going to lower levels? Does everyone understand the benefits of going to lower levels for themselves? Is everyone consciously going to labor to temper and transform themselves? This is a question that needs to be calmly analyzed. According to the analysis of some units, among those who initially signed up, some truly recognized the great political significance of cadres going to lower levels and resolutely demanded to go down to temper and transform themselves; some signed up under the "general trend," and their determination to go to lower levels was not very strong; and a small number of people had a resistant attitude toward the policy of cadres going to lower levels and were unwilling to go. That is to say, although a surge of signing up for going to lower levels has been set off, and even 100% of the people have signed up, it does not prove that every cadre's understanding is very clear, their thinking is very firm and clear, and their mood is very comfortable.
    This situation raises a question for leaders: they cannot be satisfied with the surge of registration, but also need to do in-depth and meticulous ideological work. Through debates, seminars, group meetings, and individual talks, every cadre can correctly understand the benefits of going to lower levels for themselves and for the country, so that they can consciously go to labor to temper and transform themselves. At the same time, through various methods, cadres should be encouraged to speak freely, and boldly and unreservedly reflect their understanding of going to lower levels, their true ideological situation, and various concerns and difficulties. The leadership will then work on these situations, help cadres correct their understanding, solve ideological and practical problems, and eliminate various concerns.
    Of course, doing ideological work takes some time and energy, but in order to earnestly do a good job in the work of sending cadres to lower levels, and for the sake of being responsible for the cadres sent to lower levels, spending more time and energy is completely worthwhile. Otherwise, if the cadres do not have a correct understanding of going to lower levels, and there are still many problems in their thinking, even if they go down, they will not be well tempered, and some new problems may also arise. It will be more difficult and time-consuming to solve these problems in the future. The practice of the Ministry of Culture published in this newspaper yesterday and the practice of the Hydroelectric Power Bureau published in this newspaper today are worth referring to and learning from. Before the cadres were sent to lower levels, the Ministry of Culture spent a lot of time and energy, and conscientiously and meticulously solved the ideological understanding problems and practical difficulties of the cadres sent to lower levels, so that those who left were happy and those who stayed were satisfied. The Hydroelectric Power Bureau of the Ministry of Electricity used the method of great debate to solve the problems of ideological understanding. After the list of cadres sent to lower levels was announced, the morale of the masses was very high. Comrades who originally had incorrect ideas about going to lower levels also happily posted big-character posters expressing that they wanted to go to lower levels to work hard, temper and transform themselves.
    The situations of the Ministry of Culture and the Hydroelectric Power Bureau all show how important and indispensable in-depth and meticulous ideological work is in the work of sending cadres to lower levels! It is hoped that every unit can do a good and thorough job of ideological work, and do not relax meticulous ideological work just because they see that the cadres are very enthusiastic and many have signed up to go to lower levels.

### 把思想工作做好做透

    把思想工作做好做透
    现在，许多国家机关中已掀起了干部报名要求下放参加劳动锻炼的热潮，到处是欢欢喜喜、热热闹闹。党的改造知识分子的政策已得到了广泛的响应。
    但是，是不是每一个报名下放的干部都真正认识到干部下放的政治意义了呢？是不是每一个人都理解到下放对自己的好处了呢？是不是每一个人都是很自觉地要到劳动中去锻炼、改造自己呢？这是需要冷静地进行分析的问题。根据有些单位的分析，在开始报名的人中，有一部分人是真正认识到干部下放的重大政治意义、坚决要求下去锻炼、改造自己的；有一部分人是在“大势所趋”的情况下报名的，下放的决心并不是很大；还有一小部分人对干部下放政策有抵触情绪，不愿意下去。这就是说，虽然掀起了报名下放的热潮，甚至百分之百的人都报了名，但并不能证明每个干部的认识都很清楚，思想都很坚定、明确，心情都很舒畅。
    这种情况，就给领导者提出了一个问题：不能满足于报名的热潮，还要做深入细致的思想工作，要通过辩论、座谈、小组会、个别谈话，使每个干部都能够正确地理解下放对自己对国家的好处，从而自觉地到劳动中去锻炼改造自己。同时，也要通过各种办法，使干部畅所欲言，把自己对下放的认识、真实的思想情况、各种顾虑和困难，大胆地、毫无保留地反映出来，领导上再针对着这些情况做工作，帮助干部端正认识，解决思想问题和实际问题，消除各种顾虑。
    当然，做思想工作是要花一些时间和精力的，但是，为了认真作好干部下放的工作，为了对下放干部负责，多花一些时间和精力是完全值得的。否则，干部对下放没有正确的认识，思想上还有不少问题，即使下去了，也是锻炼不好的，而且还可能产生一些新的问题。将来要解决这些问题，就会更加困难，花费的时间和精力也会更多。昨天本报发表的文化部的作法和今天本报发表的水电总局的作法，是值得参考学习的。文化部在干部下放以前，花了很多时间和精力，认真地、比较细致深入地解决了下放干部的思想认识问题和实际困难，因而做到了去者愉快、留者满意。电力部水电总局用大辩论的方法，解决了思想认识问题，下放干部名单公布后，群众情绪很高，原来对下放有不正确想法的同志，也很愉快地贴出大字报表示要下放好好劳动锻炼改造自己。
    文化部和水电总局的情况都说明：干部下放工作中深入细致的思想工作是多么重要，多么不可少！希望每个单位都能把思想工作做好做透，不要只看到干部的热情很高，报名下放的很多，就放松了细致的思想工作。
