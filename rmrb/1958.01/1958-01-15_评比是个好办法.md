Appraisal is a Good Method
Editor

In the large-scale water conservancy project in Anhui Province, the leadership adopted the method of publishing the daily progress of each special district and the engineering benefits of each ten-day period in the newspapers to promote the work. This method prompted the advanced areas to continue to move forward, and the backward areas to catch up, forming a hot revolutionary work competition among the various regions. The province's original task of building 800 million cubic meters of earthwork for farmland water conservancy was completed ahead of schedule. In December 1957, the task was doubled again - 800 million cubic meters of earthwork. After the competition situation was formed, as of January 10, more than 580 million cubic meters of earthwork had been completed for the additional task. Up to now, the farmland water conservancy built in Anhui this year is close to the sum of farmland water conservancy projects built since liberation.

As Lenin said, socialism for the first time creates the possibility of truly widely and truly on a mass scale applying competition; the possibility of attracting the truly popular majority to the labor arena -- in which the toilers are able to display themselves, to develop their abilities, reveal their talents. He said: Now that the socialist government has seized power, our task is to organize competition. We should not only organize competition among the masses, but also organize mutual competition among organizers (cadres).

In some news about water conservancy construction in Anhui Province, we have clearly seen how the farmers of the province have shown their ability and talent on the incomparably vast labor stage, and also seen the soaring revolutionary drive and organizational ability of the cadres in Anhui. After the nationwide rectification campaign, the socialist consciousness of the masses has been greatly improved. For the sake of socialism and a better life, no one is willing to lag behind others, and everyone is brave and enterprising. On such a mass basis, the leadership took advantage of the situation and used the form of organizing competitions to regularly publish and check the progress and attendance of water conservancy in various regions, so that the work of each special district was supervised by the people of the province and could be compared with each other frequently. In this way, the enthusiasm has been even more high, and the water conservancy construction in the province has been carried out vigorously. Now, the areas in Anhui Province that have completed water conservancy construction are also working hard to accumulate fertilizer and arrange various winter productions. Revolutionary competition has become a driving force for promoting the development of social productive forces here. Obviously, competition and appraisal are the best ways to resolve the contradiction between the advanced and the backward. This method of resolving contradictions is a revolutionary method. It does not reconcile the advanced and the backward, nor does it allow the advanced to stop and wait for the backward, but consciously guides the advanced and the backward to launch fierce struggles, so that the backward can catch up with the advanced, and the advanced can become more advanced, so that the entire society can develop rapidly.

In many other parts of the country, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses is also very high. If revolutionary work competitions can be carried out between agricultural cooperatives, between townships, between counties, and even between larger regions, and achievements are regularly presented for appraisal to see who does the work more, faster, better, and more economically, then the agricultural front will surely achieve greater victories.

    评比是个好办法
    编者
    安徽省领导方面在大兴水利中采取了在报上公布各个专区每日工程进度和每旬工程效益的办法来推动工作。这个办法促使先进的地区不断前进，落后地区奋起直追，形成了各个地区之间的火热的革命的工作竞赛。全省原定兴修农田水利八亿土方的任务，早已提前完成。1957年12月把任务再追加了一倍——八亿土方。竞赛局势形成以后，截至1月10日追加任务又完成了五亿八千多万土方。至此，安徽本年度兴修的农田水利已接近解放以来兴修农田水利工程的总和。
    正如列宁所说的，社会主义第一次创造了真正广泛地和真正以群众的规模来应用竞赛的可能性，把真正人民大多数吸引到劳动舞台来的可能性——在这种舞台上，劳动者能够表现他们自己，能够发挥自己的能力，显示自己的天才。他说：在社会主义政府掌握政权的现在，我们的任务就是组织竞赛。不仅要组织群众之间的竞赛，还应当组织组织者（干部）之间的相互竞赛。
    在安徽省兴修水利的一些消息中，我们已经清楚地看到了全省农民在无比广阔的劳动舞台上怎样表现出了他们的能力和天才，同时也看到了安徽干部昂扬的革命干劲和组织才能。经过全民整风运动，群众的社会主义觉悟已经大大提高。为了社会主义，为了更美好的生活，他们谁也不甘心落在别人之后，人人都是勇往直前，进取不已。在这样的群众基础上，领导方面又因势利导，运用组织竞赛的形式，定期公布和检查各个地区的水利进度和出勤情况，使各专区的工作都得到了全省人民的监督，并能经常互相比较。这样一来，干劲就更形高涨，全省的水利建设搞得有声有色。现在安徽省已经完成了水利建设的地区，又在紧张地积肥，紧张地安排各种冬季生产。革命竞赛在这里已经成了推动社会生产力向前发展的动力。很显然，竞赛和评比，是解决先进和落后的矛盾的最好的方法。这个解决矛盾的方法是革命的方法，它不是调和先进与落后，不是让先进的停下来等待落后，而是有意识地引导先进与落后之间展开激烈的斗争，使落后的赶上先进，使先进的更加先进，使整个社会迅速地向前发展。
    在全国其他许多地方，群众的革命干劲也是很高的，如果在农业社与农业社之间，乡与乡、县与县，甚至在更大的地区之间，都能开展革命的工作竞赛，定期拿出成绩来评比，看谁的工作做得又多又快又好又省，那么，农业战线就一定能得到更大的胜利。
