      The Year for Undertaking Small-Scale Water Conservancy Projects, Manure Accumulation, and Afforestation

    * The construction of small-scale water conservancy projects generally begins in the winter of the previous year, with benefits usually realized in the following year (a few areas also have immediate benefits in winter as they are built, but the crops that benefit are generally not harvested until the following year). Based on this situation, the year for undertaking small-scale water conservancy projects runs from October of the previous year to September of the following year.
    * Similar to water conservancy construction, a large portion of the fertilizer needed for production in the second year is accumulated during the winter of the previous year. The year for manure accumulation is also similar to water conservancy construction, running from the winter of the previous year to the autumn of the following year.
    * The year for afforestation runs from January to December. In a few southern regions, afforestation often continues through both the winter and spring seasons. In such regions, it is customary to count the afforestation tasks completed in the winter of the previous year towards the accounts of the following year.

    ·名词解释·
      兴修小型水利、积肥和造林的年度
    ＊小型水利的兴修一般是由前一年冬季开始，受益一般是在第二年（少数地区也有在冬季随修随受益的，但受益的作物一般也要到次年才收获）。基于这种情况，兴修小型水利的年度是由前一年的10月到第二年的9月。
    ＊积肥和修水利类似，第二年生产所需要的肥料有很大一部分是前一年冬天聚积的。积肥的年度也和修水利差不多，是由前一年的冬季到第二年的秋季。
    ＊造林的年度是由1月到12月。南方少数地区冬春两季造林往往连续进行，这样的地区按照习惯把前一年冬季完成的造林任务算到第二年的账上。
