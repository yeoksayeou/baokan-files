    Talking About Xiamen's Mountain Moving and Sea Filling
    Xidì

    This is an "old" story, but it's worth mentioning again.

    I visited Xiamen a few years ago. At that time, Xiamen was still an island. To get from Jimei to Xiamen, you had to take a sailboat or a small steamer. On the small steamer, I looked at the endless rows of small mountain islands in front of me, towering above the clear blue sea. Fortunately, there was no wind that day, and even the small waves weren't rippling. The sunlight shone on the green water, warm and oily, creating an inner sea surrounded by countless small islands that resembled a fairyland. The small steamer moved across the sea as if it were ice skating. But one thing made us very surprised. Why were so many sailboats stopped in the middle of this inner sea? They didn't look like fishing boats, nor did they look like sails returning from the open sea. There were a total of one or two hundred of them. Of course, they weren't there to avoid the wind. I asked a local who was traveling with me. His face lit up with joy, and he said with a smile:

    "Don't you know yet? Xiamen will no longer be an island. It will be connected to the mainland. We will build a long causeway between Jimei and Xiamen for trains and cars to pass. In two or three years, when you come again, you can take a train or a car. These sailboats are all transporting stone, dumping it into the sea there, as the foundation of this causeway."

    "Is that possible?" I was a little skeptical. Didn't this seem like the story of Fan Lihua moving mountains and overturning seas in a novel? I asked him, "Is this sea-filling project guaranteed to succeed? When will it be completed?"

    "Of course, it is guaranteed. We plan to level three or four mountains and use the mountain stones to fill this section of seawater where the causeway is to be built. We are actively working on it now, and we have already leveled one mountain. Every day, more than two hundred sailboats transport stones from there to here." He said, pointing, "Look, aren't the people on those boats dumping stones into the sea?"

    Sure enough, on those densely packed sailboats, countless people were moving large and small stones and throwing them into the sea. Countless hands, countless mountain stones, were constantly being dumped. "Jingwei filling the sea" is just a fable. I never thought that it would become a living, real event today.

    When I arrived in Xiamen, I found the streets were clean and tidy, and most of the buildings along the streets were in Western style. The park was a very secluded garden. There, there was a large cultural center, with a palace-style exterior. The cultural center I had seen was probably the most beautiful of all. Unfortunately, the interior was being renovated, so I couldn't go in to visit.

    "Xiamen University" is a famous southern university, built on the seaside. Standing on the seaside, you can vaguely see the Greater and Lesser Kinmen Islands, which are still occupied by the enemy. Strangely, there was no atmosphere of war at all. We couldn't tell that it was located on the front lines of national defense. The sound of "stringed instruments and singing" never stopped. The faculty and students worked and attended classes on time, just like any university in the interior. Even more strangely, this university was then carrying out large-scale construction, building a large auditorium that could accommodate more than 5,000 people; it was also building a large sports field, with open-air seats around it that could seat nearly 50,000 spectators. The scale was grand enough.

    Speaking of the grand spirit of the Southern Fujian people, it can be seen starting from the Luoyang Bridge in Quanzhou. The Luoyang Bridge, originally named Wan'an Bridge, was completed during the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Northern Song Dynasty, nearly nine hundred years ago. Cai Xiang's "Wan'an Bridge Record" says: This bridge began construction in the fifth year of Huangyou (1053) in April and was completed in the fourth year of Jiayou (1059) in December. The bridge is 3,600 feet long and 15 feet wide. This stone bridge, built nine hundred years ago, still has a very solid foundation. The section destroyed by the enemy has been repaired with wooden planks and can still be used for traffic. As we walked across this famous bridge, we thought of the high level of design ability that the engineers nine hundred years ago possessed, being able to build this stone bridge, which is as long as three Chinese miles, over the waters that are flooded by the tides day and night. Further south, we learned that stone bridges like this, four or five Chinese miles long, are not uncommon in Southern Fujian. In one area, over the bay, our ancestors built a large stone bridge, like attaching a straight chord to an arc-shaped bow, saving those walking and riding in cars a lot of detours. The bridge was originally passable by jeeps, but for safety reasons, it has been closed to traffic. Cars have to travel along the coastal highway instead of the long bridge. And that coastal highway is a full thirty kilometers long. Several of us bravely walked across the bridge, while we took a car along the coastal highway. We arrived at our destination almost at the same time. This shows how "convenient" that stone bridge was.

    "Xiamen University" was still building physics buildings and the like. They had full confidence, knowing that although the teachers and students were on the front lines of national defense, they were as safe as Mount Tai. They believed in our national defense forces and the power of the People's Liberation Army, and they did not have any feelings of worry or fear. Not only did the teachers and students of the university have this feeling, but the people of the entire city of Xiamen had never experienced any panic. One evening, we were strolling on Zhongshan Road. The air raid siren sounded. The citizens were still walking leisurely, not rushing to go home. The streetlights were still on, and the bustling city scene was not diminished in the slightest. We were a little puzzled and asked a shop assistant in a store:

    "The siren has sounded, why don't you turn off the lights?"

    He replied slowly: "This is a common occurrence. When the planes take off from the other side, we sound the alarm. But there's no need to pay attention to them at all, they don't dare to fly over. So, we don't need to turn off the lights, we can still do business as usual."

    Yes, our powerful and unparalleled national defense forces are sufficient to protect the safety of the people! On the front lines of national defense, it is particularly evident how much our people love and trust our People's Liberation Army. There is a story that is widely circulated. The People's Liberation Army was digging trenches in a certain mountainous area. But there, the people had already planted a lot of sweet potatoes. The soldiers, afraid of damaging those sweet potatoes, quickly dug them up and transplanted them to the nearby hillside. The next day, the people went up the mountain and saw that their sweet potatoes had been moved. This is the famous story of "sweet potatoes moving house." No, this is not a "story," but a real event that actually happened.

    We stayed in Xiamen for several days. In addition to work, we also had time to visit several scenic spots. The famous "South Putuo Temple" is located on the Five Peak Mountain near Xiamen.

    We climbed to the top of Five Peak Mountain and took in the surrounding scenery with a refreshed and delighted mind. The sea was so infinitely vast and deep, embracing countless islands, large and small. The white foam of the waves rhythmically and slowly crashed onto the ochre-colored ancient rocks by the sea, as if breaking into pieces under the rocks, yet it seemed to be rhythmically and slowly receding. At this time, there was a gentle breeze blowing. White sailboats steadily sailed in and out of the harbor. Green waters and green mountains formed the most harmonious good pictures here. It was such a bay surrounded by mountains and water. It was such a lightly clouded and delicately sparkling water surface. It was such a layer upon layer of mountain peaks, majestically standing out to sea. It was such a moist and warm landscape painting that is unique to the South. We thought that the scenery would be even more enchanting at sunset with its colorful afterglow, or at dawn with its reddish-purple clouds rising from the east, or when the silvery-white moon dimly shone on this calm bay at night, or when the misty drizzle, like light smoke and thin fog, shrouded these sea peaks. Even in this clear and sunny day, we were so captivated by the surrounding scenery that we were reluctant to go down the mountain.

    The products here are extremely abundant, especially bananas, which are available for sale all year round. Every family has one or several dark green lychee or longan trees, just like every family in Beijing has a jujube tree. From time to time, a faint, rich fragrance wafted over, not from the sweet osmanthus—osmanthus blooms in all seasons there, hence the name sweet osmanthus—but from the citron flower, which was emitting its fragrance. There, there is almost no winter air. Many flowers bloom and wither, never stopping the "Flower Festival." The Yuan Dynasty poet Zhang Yanghao wrote in a poem: "Mountains have no height and low all flowing water, trees do not have autumn and winter all release flowers," which accurately describes the characteristics of this place.

    It is such a fairy island-like Xiamen Island, but now it is no longer an island, but is connected to the mainland. From the beginning of this year's New Year's Day, the Yingtan Railway has been able to carry passengers. The great project of moving mountains and filling the sea is no longer a fantasy, no longer an illusion, but a living reality! When we go to Xiamen again, we can take the train directly to Xiamen Port. Such grand construction is only possible in a socialist society. We are doing many great things that predecessors have never done. This mountain-moving and sea-filling project, which is enough to make the Luoyang Bridge or other large stone bridges in Southern Fujian pale in comparison, is one of the unprecedented construction projects. The story of Luoyang Bridge has become a "myth," and has been broadcast as an opera. Will the story of this sea causeway, which far surpasses Luoyang Bridge, not also become a modern "legend" and be written into poems, novels, and operas?

    移山填海话厦门
    西谛
    这是“旧”话了，但还值得重提。
    几年前曾到过厦门。那时厦门还是一个海岛。从集美到厦门去，一定要乘帆船或小汽轮。我在小汽轮上，望着前面一重山、一重山的无穷尽的小山岛，耸峙于碧澄澄的海水之上，恰巧那天没有风，连小波浪也不曾在潾潾地跳跃着，太阳光照射在绿水上，燠暖而作油光，是仙境似的为无数小岛屿所围绕的内海。小汽轮在海面上像滑冰似的走着。但有一件事使我们觉得很诧异。为什么有那么多的帆船停在这内海的当中呢？不像是渔船，也不像是远海的归帆。总有一二百只的数目，当然也不是为了避风，问问同行的本地人。他脸上闪耀着喜悦的光亮，微笑的说道：
    “你们还不知道么？厦门将不再是一个岛屿了，她将和大陆连接了起来。我们将在集美和厦门之间建筑一道长堤，走火车，也走汽车。过个三两年，你们再来的时候，就可以乘火车或汽车来了。这些帆船都是运载石料，倾倒于那里的海中，作为这道长堤的基石的。”
    “这有可能么？”我心里有些怀疑，这不像小说里写的樊梨花移山倒海的故事么？一面问他道：“这个填海的大工程有把握么？什么时候可以完成？”
    “当然有把握。我们准备削平三四座山，用山石来填平这一段预备筑堤的海水。现在已在积极进行着了，并且已经削平一座山。每天总有二百只以上的帆船，从那边把石块运载到这里来。”他一面说，一面指着道：“你们看，那边船上的人不是在把石块倒在海里么？”
    果然的，在那边密集着的帆船上，有无数的人在搬运着大大小小的石块，往海水里抛下。无数只手，无数块山石，在不停的倾抛着。“精卫填海”，只是寓言。想不到如今是竟成为活生生的现实的事迹了。
    到了厦门，觉得街道整洁，沿街的房子，以洋式的为多。公园是一座很幽深的园林。在那里，有一座很大的文化馆，外表是宫殿式的建筑。我所见到过的文化馆，恐怕要算这一座是最漂亮的了。可惜内部正在整理，没法进去参观。
    “厦门大学”是一所著名的南方的大学，就建筑在海边。站在海边就可以隐隐约约地望得见尚为敌人所占领的大小金门岛。奇怪的是，一点战争的气氛也没有。我们看不出她是座落在国防最前线。“弦歌之声”不绝，教职员们和学生们完全按时工作，按时上课，和内地的任何大学没有什么不同。更奇怪的是，这所大学，那时正在大兴土木，建筑一座可以容纳五千多人的大礼堂；还在建筑一个大运动场，它的露天的四周的圆座，足足可以坐上观众近五万人。那气魄是够弘大的。
    说起闽南人的弘伟的气魄来，从泉州的洛阳桥开始，就能够看得出。洛阳桥本名万安桥，落成于北宋仁宗时代，离今已有九百年了。蔡襄的“万安桥记”说：这桥始建于皇祐五年（一○五三年）四月，落成于嘉祐四年（一○五九年）十二月。桥长凡三千六百尺，广丈有五尺。这九百年前所建筑的石桥，桥基还很稳固。被敌人炸毁的一段，已用木板补好，照样能够通车。我们走过这座著名的桥梁就想起九百年前的工程师们具有怎样的高度的设计能力，能够在昼夜为海潮所泛滥的水面上，架起这座长及三华里的石桥来。后来越向南走，就知道像这样长到四五华里的石桥，在闽南是不足为奇的。在一个地区，在海湾之上，我们的先人们就建造了一座大石桥，像在弧形的弓上，安上一根直弦，使走路坐车的人少走了不少弯路。那座桥本来可以走吉普车，但为了安全起见，已经禁止通车。汽车都要沿着海边的公路走，不走那座长桥了。而那条海边公路足足有三十公里长。我们之中，有几个人奋勇地步行从桥上走过，而我们则坐了汽车沿海边公路走。几乎是同时到达目的地。由此可见那座石桥是如何的“便捷”了。
    “厦大”还在建筑着物理楼之类的。他们有充分的信心，知道师生们虽身处于国防最前线，却是安如泰山。他们相信我们的国防力量和人民解放军的威力，丝毫也没有任何的担心受怕之感。不仅大学的师生们有这样的感觉，整个厦门市的人民也从来没有发生过任何恐慌。有一天傍晚，我们在中山路上闲步。防空的警报响了。市民们仍是安闲地走着，并不急急地想回家。街上的电灯照样地亮着，热闹的市容，一点也没有减色。我们有点不解了，就去问一家店铺里的伙计：
    “警报响了，你们为什么还不关上电灯？”
    他徐缓地答道：“这是常有的事。对面的飞机起飞了，我们就响起警报来。但根本上不用去理会他们，他们是不敢飞过来的。所以，我们也可以不关灯，还是照样地做买卖。”
    是的，我们的强大无匹的国防力量是足以保卫着人民的安全的！在国防前线上，特别的看得出我们人民是怎样地爱戴和信赖我们的解放军。有一个故事，流传得很广。解放军在某山区挖壕沟。但在那里，老百姓已种下了不少白薯。军士们怕把那些白薯搞坏了，连忙代为掘起，移种到附近的山坡上去。第二天，老百姓上山一看，他们的白薯已经搬了家。这是有名的“白薯搬家”的故事。不，这不是“故事”，乃是实实在在发生过的实事。
    我们在厦门住了好几天。除了工作之外，还能有时间到几个名胜古迹的地方去游览。那里的名胜“南普陀寺”，就在厦门的附近的五峰山上。
    我们登上了五峰山顶，心旷神怡地恣意吸取着四周的风景。海水是那末无穷的广大、深远，它拥抱着大大小小的无数的岛屿，白色的浪沫在澎澎湃湃地有节奏而徐缓地扑向海边的赭苍色的古老的岩石上来，仿佛是摔碎在岩下，却又像是有节奏而徐缓地引退了。这时，有微风在吹拂着。白色的帆船在安稳地驶进或驶出港口。绿水和青山在这里是最和谐地构成了不止一幅两幅的好图画。是那样地山环水抱的海湾。是那样地轻云微罩，白波细跳的水面。是那样地重重叠叠的山峰，一层又一层的显露地雄峙于海上。是那样地像南方所特有的润湿温暖的山水画。我们想，在晚霞斑烂的夕阳西下的时候，或在曙红色的黎明带着紫黑色的云片从东方升起的时候，或是银白色的月亮朦朦胧胧地映照在这平静的夜的海湾上的时候，或那样地蒙蒙细雨，像轻烟薄雾似的笼罩着这些海上的群峰的时候，那些景色的变幻，是更会十分迷人的。就在这晴天白日的时候，我们也为这四围的风光所沉醉而舍不得下山。
    这里的物产丰富极了，特别是香蕉，整年地都有得卖。家家有一株或好几株的墨绿色的荔枝树或龙眼树，就像北京那里家家有棵枣子树似的。不时的有暗暗的浓香，扑鼻而来，那不是月桂花——在那里，桂花是四季皆开放着的，故名月桂——就是香椽花在喷射出它的香气来。在那里，几乎没有冬气。许许多多的花卉，此开彼谢，从没有停止过“花朝”。元人张养浩有诗道：“山无高下皆行水，树不秋冬尽放花”，正道着这里的特色。
    是这样仙岛似的厦门岛，而如今却已经不再是一个岛屿，而是和大陆连接在一起了。从今年的元旦起，鹰潭铁路已经可以运载旅客了。移山填海的大工程，不再是幻想，不再是空想，而已是活生生的现实了！再要到厦门去的时候，我们可以乘坐着火车直达厦门港了。这样弘伟的建设，只有在社会主义社会里才会有可能实现。我们正在做着许许多多前人从未做过的大事业。这一番移山填海的足以使洛阳桥或其他的那些闽南的大石桥都暗然无色的大工程，就是空前的建设事业之一。洛阳桥的故事，已成为“神话”，已播为戏曲。这远远地超过洛阳桥的移山填海的海上长堤的故事，难道不会也变成了现代的“传说”，而被写入诗歌、小说和戏曲里去？
