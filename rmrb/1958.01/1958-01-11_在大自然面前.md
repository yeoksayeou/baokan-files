　　Before Nature

　　How did our existing cultivated land come about? In ancient times, our ancestors faced nature empty-handed. In the struggle with nature, they created production tools and painstakingly reclaimed barren wilderness, while also developing their wisdom. If our ancestors had adopted an attitude of waiting for handouts from nature, what would our lives be like today? It's unimaginable!

　　History has developed to this day, and scattered forces have become a huge collective; thus, the unprecedentedly great mission of transforming nature falls on the shoulders of our generation. This requires us to break with convention and deal with nature more bravely than our predecessors.

　　Who says that people in Jiangnan are destined to eat rice, while people in Huaibei are destined to mainly eat coarse grains? Indeed, that was the case in the past. It is said that the land in Huaibei is "leaky soil" and cannot retain water; or that there is not enough water in Huaibei to grow rice. Can't the land be transformed into water-retaining land? Can't more water be brought in? In the past, in the face of scattered, weak, and powerless small producers, it was truly unthinkable. Now, this is something that can be done. More than one million mu of low-yield dry land in Huaibei has been transformed into high-yield paddy fields, with yields increasing by one to two times at once. The people there are planning to expand the paddy fields by several million mu, tens of millions of mu, to transform Huaibei into a beautiful and prosperous place like Jiangnan.

　　People who overemphasize "natural conditions are too bad" and always want to classify their regions as "exempt" areas from meeting the "Forty Articles" targets should think carefully: In the face of nature, should we bow our heads and surrender, or should we face it squarely and conquer it?

### 在大自然面前

    在大自然面前
    现有的耕地是怎样来的？在远古时代，我们的祖先赤手空拳面对着大自然，在同大自然搏斗中创造了生产工具，艰辛地开垦了一片一片荒芜的旷野，同时也发展了自己的智慧。如果我们的祖先在大自然面前都采取坐待恩赐的态度，今天我们的生活会是什么样子？岂堪设想！
    历史发展到了今天，分散的力量变成了巨大的集体；于是，空前伟大的变革大自然的使命落在我们这一代人肩上。这就要求我们打破陈规，比我们的先人更加勇敢地对付大自然。
    谁说江南人命定了要吃大米，而淮北人命定了要以杂粮为主食？的确，过去是这样的。据说，淮北的地是“漏风土”，存不住水；或者说，淮北的水种水稻不够用。难道不可以把地改造成不漏水的吗？难道不可以弄来更多的水吗？过去，在分散的软弱无力的小生产者面前，真是连想也不敢想。现在，这是可以做到的事情了。淮北已经有一百多万亩低产旱地变成了高产稻田，产量一下子提高一倍到两倍。那里的人们正打算把稻田再扩大几百万亩，几千万亩，要把淮北变成江南一样美丽、富庶。
    过分强调“自然条件太坏”，总想把自己的地区划为达到“四十条”指标的“除外”地区的人们，应该好好想想：在大自然面前，是低下头来屈服呢，还是正视它，征服它？
