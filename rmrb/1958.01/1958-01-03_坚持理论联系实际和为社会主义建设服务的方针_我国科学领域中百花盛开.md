Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd - At the request of a Xinhua News Agency reporter, a person in charge of the Chinese Academy of Sciences outlined the achievements of the Chinese Academy of Sciences during the First Five-Year Plan. Over the past five years, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has researched and solved some major key scientific problems proposed by the country's industrial and agricultural development and cultural development, vigorously carried out investigations and research on the motherland's natural resources and natural conditions, and correspondingly developed basic natural science theories and research in philosophy and social sciences. At the same time, it actively established or strengthened the latest science and technology departments and important basic disciplines that China lacked in the past or were very weak. In the philosophy and social science departments, the position of Marxism-Leninism was expanded, laying a preliminary foundation for the realization of the twelve-year science development long-term plan.

Many of the latest technologies and emerging disciplines have begun to be established
The latest technologies and emerging disciplines such as atomic energy science, semiconductors, low-temperature physics, computer technology, ultra-high frequency technology, automation, titanium metallurgy, gas turbines, chemical fluid mechanics, operations research, thermochemistry, and fluorine chemistry have begun to be established. Many disciplines that are of great importance to national construction and scientific development, such as computational mathematics, mechanics, inorganic chemistry, microbiology, geobotany, mammology, fish ecology, seismology, geochemistry, and micro-paleontology, have begun to build foundations or have been strengthened. Some disciplines, such as metallurgy, petroleum, polymer, antibiotics, etc., have developed significantly. Emerging disciplines such as atomic energy science have reached a considerable scale.

Research has solved some major scientific problems in industrial and agricultural development
Many of the Academy's work serves the country's socialist construction and has made preliminary achievements. For example, in coordination with industrial construction, it researched and solved the smelting problem of Baotou iron ore, providing important data for the design of the Baotou steel base. It evaluated, identified, and researched crude oil from Karamay, Yanchang, Yumen, Qaidam and other places, provided preliminary plans for crude oil processing, and provided necessary data for the rational utilization of petroleum resources; the research on artificial petroleum methods laid a scientific foundation for expanding China's sources of liquid fuel. It basically mastered the complete set of optical glass melting technology, helping the industrial sector lay the foundation for the optical glass industry, and also successfully trial-produced and promoted more than a dozen precision optical instruments. It carried out research on the chemical structure of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, assisting the industrial sector in establishing the production of penicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and chlortetracycline. In recent years, it has further carried out research on finding new antibiotics and has found an antibiotic K that may have anti-cancer effects. It helped the industrial sector establish the production base of organic glass and capron high-strength fiber, providing data on the establishment of the synthetic rubber industry. It studied the method of using bagasse to make rayon, expanding fiber resources. Other research results in areas such as ductile iron, oxygen steelmaking, the manufacture of aromatic hydrocarbons, the extraction of shale oil, precision casting, electrical engineering, refractory materials, ceramics, loess mechanical properties, building materials, and high-temperature yeast have practical value and have been largely promoted. Although operations research has only been established for a short time, it has researched and solved the problem of the flow direction and flow of industrial coal in the railway transportation in the Northeast, which can save a lot of funds.

Through the study of the causes and geographical distribution of locust areas, suggestions were made for eradicating locust plagues in Weishan Lake and Hongze Lake, and research has begun on eradicating locust areas in the coastal areas. According to the research and mastery of the occurrence law of cotton aphids, through experiments in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei and other places, a set of prediction and forecasting methods for the occurrence of cotton aphids was proposed, which has guiding significance for the prevention and control of cotton aphids in various cotton areas. Castor silkworms have been promoted in key provinces such as Anhui, Jiangsu, and Henan, opening up a favorable sideline for areas that are not suitable for the development of mulberry silkworms and tussah silkworms. The research on the life history of laver confirmed that laver is developed from the spores of conchocelis, solving the key problem in the laver farming industry. Relevant research on kelp proves that commercial production can also be carried out along the coast of Zhejiang, so that kelp farming areas can be expanded southward to the vast sea areas of East China. In addition, the research results on plant diseases, shipworm control, and bacterial fertilizers also have practical significance.

Carry out investigations and research on natural resources and natural conditions
In terms of investigation and research on natural resources and natural conditions, the investigation of 350,000 square kilometers of severely eroded areas in the middle reaches of the Yellow River was completed, and long-term plans and phased plans for soil and water conservation and rational land use were made. The soil survey of 180,000 square kilometers in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of the Yellow River and 15,000 square kilometers in the Yangtze River Basin was completed, and more than 250 maps of soil and groundwater at a scale of 1:50,000 were completed, providing necessary data for the formulation of basin plans and agricultural plans. The Sino-Soviet Heilongjiang Comprehensive Expedition Team, in which the Academy of Sciences participated, conducted investigation and research on the region's hydropower, geological minerals, natural conditions, forests, and transportation, which will provide a scientific basis for the long-term planning of the region's national economic development. The investigation in northern Xinjiang has been basically completed, providing suggestions for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry in northern Xinjiang. The investigation of tropical resources in South China provided suggestions for improving rubber fertilization and standards for planting rubber forests, which has guiding significance for the rubber forest planting industry and saved a lot of funds for the country. The rich and diverse biological resources in southern Yunnan and northwestern Guangxi were investigated, and valuable research was conducted on the development of lac resources. Geological investigations were conducted in Qilian Mountains, Qaidam Basin, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hunan and other places, providing a scientific basis for the general survey and exploration of petroleum, manganese and other mineral deposits urgently needed by the motherland; a large number of fossils were identified, contributing to the division and comparison of strata, which played a guiding role in geological survey and exploration. The survey in the Qaidam Basin initially estimated that the salt reserves in the Qaidam Basin are more than 50 billion tons. The investigation of 585 lakes in Hubei Province and the fish survey in the South China Sea, Yellow Sea, Bohai Sea, Heilongjiang River, and Yangtze River provided a scientific basis for the development of the aquatic products industry. A seismic work team was established from scratch, many seismic stations were added, and China's first seismic zoning map and seismic intensity table were completed. Assisted the meteorological department in establishing medium-term (36 hours to 8 days) weather forecasts; the research results on cold waves and plum rains are helpful to improve the forecast of disastrous weather. In terms of geodetic surveying, two basic astronomical points in Urumqi and Chengdu and seventy-seven gravity points were measured. In terms of astronomical time service, the instruments and equipment were improved, so that the time service accuracy can meet the needs of geodetic surveying. The work of formulating China's natural regionalization is in progress, and basically all natural regionalization maps and explanatory notes can be completed in 1958, which has important reference value for the country to formulate long-term construction plans.

Always attach importance to the research of basic theories of natural science
While serving the needs of national construction, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has always attached importance to the research of basic theories of natural science. Over the past five years, researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have made achievements with high academic standards in topology, complex variable function theory, metal physics, crystallography, cosmic rays, plant alkaloid chemistry, polymer physical chemistry, plant taxonomy, neurophysiology, embryonic development, enzyme chemistry and protein chemistry, regional geology, geotectonics, paleontology, weather science, etc., and have been well received in the relevant international scientific community.

Social science workers have worked hard to study Marxism-Leninism and carried out various discussions in connection with the practice of socialist revolution and construction
Most of the philosophy and social science workers of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have worked hard to study Marxism-Leninism, so that their work is gradually combined with the practice of socialist revolution and construction, and criticized Hu Shi's and Hu Feng's idealistic philosophy, historiography, literary viewpoints and Keynes' bourgeois reactionary economics viewpoints. Especially through this anti-rightist struggle, it thoroughly exposed and destroyed the rightists' conspiracy to restore bourgeois "social science", and trained and expanded the academic team of Marxism-Leninism; the contradictions between the productive forces and production relations, the foundation and superstructure, and the basic economic laws in China's transition period were heatedly discussed; in connection with socialist economic construction and socialist transformation, the submergence losses in the Sanmenxia Reservoir area and the industrial working capital situation were investigated, and suggestions for handling them were proposed; the "Shaanxi and Gansu Economic Zoning Plan" and the "First Draft of the Comprehensive Economic Chapter of the Yangtze River Basin Planning" were completed, and a large amount of information on agricultural cooperation, socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and handicrafts was researched and compiled. In addition, information on China's modern economic history, industrial history, agricultural history, handicraft history, etc. was compiled and published. For the standardization of Chinese language, several volumes of phonetics works centered on Mandarin were completed, including "Grammar Lectures" and "Word Formation of Modern Chinese". In addition, a preliminary general survey of Chinese dialects was basically completed, and some works on the history of Chinese language were published. Assisted fifteen ethnic minorities in designing twenty-one writing schemes. Basic research on China's social and economic history, intellectual history, modern history, and philosophical history was conducted, and heated debates were launched on issues such as the periodization of China's ancient and modern history, the germ of capitalism, the formation of the Han nationality, the methodology of Chinese philosophical history research, and the inheritance of philosophical heritage. Due to the large-scale development of national infrastructure, archaeological excavation work has developed unprecedentedly. In recent years, the Neolithic site of Banpo Village in Xi'an and the Western Zhou site of Keshengzhuang in Chang'an have been excavated. In the Sanmenxia Reservoir area, 211 ancient residential sites were discovered, and microlithic cultures in the sand dune areas of Chaoyi and Dali in Shaanxi were discovered. The excavation in Liujiaxia clarified the distribution of Neolithic cultures in the area; further refuted Anderson's erroneous periodization of ancient cultures in Gansu. Various studies have been carried out on China's classical literature, modern literature, folk literature, and Western literature, and discussions have been held on literary and artistic theory issues. International relations, the history of natural science, ethnology, and law are blank or weak departments in China's past social science field, and now institutions have been established or started to be established to carry out research.

About 4,000 scientific papers were completed in five years.

The number of researchers has tripled, the number of research institutions has doubled, and the total number of research topics has increased more than tripled in five years
The Chinese Academy of Sciences implemented the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, and improved the political awareness of scientific workers. Many senior researchers and young scientific workers have joined the Communist Party. The growth of young researchers is very rapid. The postgraduate system has been established, and various research institutions have enrolled 340 postgraduates in 147 majors. In order to train scientific cadres in China's blank and weak disciplines, a large number of postgraduates, advanced students, and interns have been sent to the Soviet Union and other brother countries. Many scientists who had resided abroad in the past have also returned to China to participate in scientific work under the encouragement of patriotism in recent years, and have requested ideological transformation. The number of researchers in the Academy has grown from 1,292 at the end of 1952 to more than 5,500 at present, and the number of research institutions has grown from 31 at the end of 1952 to 68 at present. The total number of research topics in 1957 has increased to more than three times that of 1953.

Over the past five years, the area of basic construction completed by the Academy of Sciences and the funds used for scientific equipment have increased considerably, and many valuable instruments have been added. Now the equipment of some research institutes of the Academy of Sciences is no less than the level of some scientifically advanced countries in Western Europe. In the past five years, the total number of books in the Academy has increased by about 2.5 million, and the number of periodicals has increased by about 1.7 million. The Scientific Publishing House of the Academy of Sciences has published a total of 1,106 kinds of books (including 413 monographs) with a total of more than 150 million words and a total distribution of more than 4 million copies, and published 95 kinds of scientific journals with a total of more than 150 million words and a distribution of 12 million copies. The living welfare of scientific workers has also been appropriately improved.

The Party's leadership has promoted the prosperity of scientific work
The person in charge of the Academy of Sciences pointed out that thanks to the Party's leadership, the adherence to the socialist road of developing science, the support and assistance of all parties, the efforts of all scientific workers, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the work of the Academy of Sciences can advance so rapidly. He said that the Party put forward the policy of integrating theory with practice and serving socialist construction, and it is precisely because of adhering to this policy that scientific workers can contribute to national construction and at the same time promote the rapid development of science. In order to develop science in a planned and organized manner, the Party has vigorously strengthened the Academy of Sciences, making the Academy of Sciences the center of national academic leadership and key research, which will be of great significance to the future development of China's scientific cause. The Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of scientific workers and promoted the prosperity of academic research. The Party has also sent a group of party member cadres to the Academy of Sciences to participate in the work, strengthening the Party's specific leadership over the Academy of Sciences and giving scientific workers great help.

The person in charge of the Academy of Sciences finally pointed out that there are also many shortcomings in the work of the Academy of Sciences in the past five years. At present, there are still many problems in the Academy of Sciences that need to be further resolved. For example, the ideological transformation of scientific workers still needs to be further improved. In order to build a scientific team of the working class that is both red and expert, arduous efforts are still needed. The bureaucratic, subjectivist, and sectarian styles in the leadership work of the Academy of Sciences need to be overcome in the rectification movement. Academic leadership needs to be further strengthened, and working conditions and other issues need to be further improved. The tasks of the twelve-year scientific long-term plan, especially the research tasks related to new technologies, are very important, and it is necessary to redouble our efforts and quickly improve the level of scientific work to meet the urgent needs of national socialist construction. At present, there is a phenomenon of extravagance and waste in varying degrees in various units of the Academy of Sciences, and it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and running science diligently and thriftily.

Brief annotations of terms

    始终重视对自然科学基本理论的研究
    中国科学院在为国家建设需要服务的同时，始终重视对自然科学基本理论的研究。五年来，中国科学院的研究人员在拓扑学、复变数函数论、金属物理学、结晶学、宇宙线、植物碱化学、高分子物理化学、植物分类学、神经生理、胚胎发育、酶化学和蛋白质化学、区域地质学、大地构造学、古生物学、天气学等等方面，都做出了有较高学术水平的成绩，在有关的国际科学界得到了好评。
    社会科学工作者努力学习马克思列宁主义，结合社会主义革命和建设的实践开展了多方面的讨论
    中国科学院的大部分哲学社会科学工作者努力学习了马克思列宁主义，使自己的工作逐渐和社会主义革命和建设实践相结合，对胡适、胡风的唯心主义哲学、史学、文学观点和凯因斯的资产阶级反动经济学观点进行了批判，特别是通过这次反右派斗争，彻底揭露并摧毁了右派分子企图使资产阶级“社会科学”复辟的阴谋，锻炼并扩大了马克思列宁主义的学术队伍；对我国过渡时期的生产力和生产关系的矛盾、基础和上层建筑、基本经济规律等等进行了热烈讨论；结合社会主义经济建设和社会主义改造，调查了三门峡水库区淹没损失和工业流动资金状况，提出了处理的建议；完成了“陕、甘两省经济区划方案”和“长江流域规划综合经济篇初稿”，研究并编纂了大量的有关农业合作化、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造和手工业的多种资料，此外，还编成并出版了有关我国近代经济史、工业史、农业史、手工业史等等的资料。为了汉语规范化，完成了几册以普通话为中心的语音学著作“语法讲话”和“现代汉语的构词法”。此外，还基本完成了汉语方言初步普查，出版了一些有关汉语史的著作。帮助十五个少数民族设计了二十一种文字方案。进行了我国社会经济史、思想史、近代史、哲学史等基本性研究，开展了有关我国古代史、近代史分期，资本主义萌芽、汉民族形成、中国哲学史研究的方法论和哲学遗产的继承等问题的热烈争论。由于国家基本建设的大规模开展，考古发掘工作空前发展，几年来发掘了西安半坡村的新石器时代的遗址，长安客省庄的西周遗址。在三门峡水库区发现了古代居住遗址二百一十一处，并发现了陕西朝邑和大荔的砂丘地带的细石器文化。在刘家峡的发掘，明确了该地区新石器时代文化的分布情况；进一步驳斥了安特生对甘肃远古文化的错误分期。对我国古典文学、现代文学、民间文学、西洋文学，开展了多方面的研究，并进行了文艺理论问题的讨论。国际关系、自然科学史、民族学、法学是我国过去社会科学领域内的空白、薄弱部门，现在也都建立或开始建立机构，开展研究。
    五年中完成的科学论文共约四千篇左右。
    五年中研究人员增加三倍，研究机构增加一倍，研究题目总数增加三倍以上
    中国科学院贯彻执行党的团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策，提高了科学工作者的政治觉悟。不少高级研究人员和青年科学工作者参加了共产党。青年研究人员的成长很迅速。研究生制度已经建立，各个研究机构招收了一百四十七个专业的三百四十名研究生。为了培养我国空白和薄弱学科的科学干部，向苏联和其他兄弟国家派遣了大批研究生、进修人员和实习人员。许多过去留居国外的科学家近年来在爱国主义的鼓舞下也纷纷归国参加了科学工作，并且要求进行思想改造。科学院研究人员已从1952年底的一千二百九十二人发展到目前的五千五百多人，研究机构已从1952年底的三十一个发展到目前的六十八个。1957年研究题目总数已增加到1953年的三倍以上。
    五年来，科学院完成的基本建设面积和用于科学器材的经费增长相当大，贵重仪器添置很多。现在科学院若干研究所的设备，已不下于西欧若干科学先进国家的水平。五年中全院图书约增添二百五十万册，期刊约一百七十万册。科学院所属科学出版社五年来共出版图书一千一百零六种（其中专著四百一十三种），共一亿五千多万字，发行总量四百多万册，出版科学期刊九十五种，共一亿五千多万字，发行量一千二百万册。科学工作者的生活福利也有适当的改进。
    党领导和促进了科学工作的繁荣
    科学院负责人指出：由于党的领导，由于坚持了社会主义的发展科学的道路，由于各方面的支持帮助，全体科学工作者的努力和苏联的无私援助，科学院的工作才能如此迅速地前进。他说，党提出了理论联系实际、科学工作为社会主义建设服务的方针，正是由于坚持了这个方针，才使科学工作者能对国家建设作出贡献，同时促进了科学事业的迅速发展。党为了有计划、有组织地发展科学事业，大力加强了科学院，使科学院成为全国学术领导和重点研究的中心，这对今后中国科学事业的发展，将有极重大意义。党的百家争鸣的方针，大大鼓舞了科学工作者的积极性，促进了学术研究的繁荣。党还派遣了一批党员干部到科学院参加工作，加强了党对科学院的具体领导，给科学工作者以巨大的帮助。
    科学院负责人最后指出：科学院五年来的工作也存在着不少缺点。目前科学院也还存在许多有待进一步解决的问题。例如，科学工作者的思想改造尚需要进一步做好，为了建立一支又红又专的工人阶级的科学队伍，还需要作艰苦的努力。科学院领导工作中的官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义作风有待于在整风运动中克服。学术领导有待进一步加强，工作条件等问题有待进一步改善。十二年科学远景规划的任务，特别是有关新技术的研究任务十分重大，需要加倍努力，迅速提高科学工作水平，以适应国家社会主义建设的迫切需要。目前科学院各单位中不同程度地存在着铺张浪费现象，必须认真贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭办科学的方针。
