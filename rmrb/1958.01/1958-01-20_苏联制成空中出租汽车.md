Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 19th: According to TASS, Kiev, January 18th: Ukrainian aircraft designer Antonov, the designer of the famous "An-10" turboprop aircraft, has created an air taxi - the "Little Bee" passenger plane.

This new type of aircraft, which can carry six to eight passengers, is suitable for short-distance, low-altitude flights. It does not require a dedicated airport: a small area of ​​fifty to sixty meters long is sufficient for it to take off and land. The aircraft is equipped with "blind flight" instruments for use in adverse weather conditions and night flights. The air taxi's speed is fifty to two hundred and thirty kilometers per hour.

Any car driver can pilot this twin-engine monoplane - the "Little Bee" - after a short period of aerial practice.

The "Little Bee" passenger plane is about to begin formal passenger flights. Aircraft of this type for other uses are under manufacture.

    苏联制成空中出租汽车
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社基辅18日讯：乌克兰的飞机设计师、著名的涡轮螺旋桨式飞机“安—10”式的设计者安东诺夫制成了一种空中出租汽车——“小蜜蜂”客机。
    这种可载六名到八名乘客的新型飞机适于作短途低空飞行。它不需要专门的机场：一块长五十到六十公尺的小场地就足够它起飞和着陆用了。飞机上装有“盲航”仪器，供它在不良气候条件下和夜间飞行时使用。空中出租汽车的速度为每小时五十至二百三十公里。
    任何一个汽车司机经过短时间的空中练习后，都能够驾驶这种双发动机单翼飞机——“小蜜蜂”。
    “小蜜蜂”客机即将正式载客飞行。供其他用途的这种飞机正在制造中。
