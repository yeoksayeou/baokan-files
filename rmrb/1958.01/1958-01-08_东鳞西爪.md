Eastern Scales and Western Claws

　　Returning More Than Six Thousand Mu of Land to Farmers
　　Amidst the rectification campaign, Sichuan Province reclaimed 6,980+ mu of land that had been requisitioned by construction units but remained unused, and returned it to agricultural cooperatives for cultivation. Calculating the annual yield at 600 jin per mu, this will increase grain production by more than 4 million jin per year. (Wu Lixun)

　　Expanding the Xuan Paper Factory
　　The only factory in China that produces Xuan paper – the Jingxian Xuan Paper Factory in Anhui Province – is undergoing a large-scale renovation project. Since the implementation of joint state-private ownership, the factory has seen significant improvements in output and quality through annual investment and expansion. However, due to severe damage inflicted by the reactionary government before liberation, as well as the manual operation of the production process, the current output is barely sufficient to meet the exclusive sales agreement with Beijing Rongbaozhai. In light of this situation, the Anhui Provincial Department of Industry has decided to invest in its renovation.
　　The renovation project of the Xuan Paper Factory will largely retain the original characteristics of the production process, with only partial improvements. For example, caustic soda cooking of sandalwood bark will replace the original long-term steaming method, and pulping machines will replace the heavy labor of water-powered pestles. In addition, seven new production workshops and warehouses will be built. Once the renovation project is completed and put into production, the annual output of Xuan paper will increase by one and a half times compared to the present.

　　Paddy Field Seeder
　　Liu Wuting, a member of the Fourth Yangtie Production Cooperative in Changchun City, Jilin Province, successfully manufactured a paddy field seeder.
　　This seeder is flexible whether pulled by a person or pushed by hand, and can be used at the edges of the field. Using this tool to sow paddy fields, each person can sow about 20 mu per day, which is more than three times the efficiency of the current hand-grabbing sowing method. (Huo Fengshan)

　　Automatic Plow
　　An automatic plow has recently been discovered in the southern region of Shanxi Province. The plow body is only three chi (approximately 1 meter) long, and the plow is equipped with a 1.5 horsepower motor. When started, only one person needs to hold it to plow, harrow, and sow. Recent trials in Fushan and Linfen counties have shown that it can plow up to 8 mu of land in a day, which is more than twice the workload of a new-style walking plow, and the cost is also lower.
　　Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and scientific and technical personnel, after visiting, believe that this plow is very light and can be used not only on small plots of land in plains, but also on terraced fields and slopes in mountainous areas, providing a new type of tool for reforming cultivation techniques in mountainous areas.
　　This plow was discovered when the Linfen County Handicraft Cooperative was cleaning its warehouse. According to veteran workers, it was a sample imported from abroad before liberation. The Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to this plow and has entrusted it to the local state-owned Linfen Machinery Factory for research and trial production.

    东鳞西爪
    还给农民六千多亩地
    整风声中，四川省把六千九百八十多亩被建设单位征而未用的土地，收回交给农业社耕种。这些土地每亩年产量以六百斤计算，每年增产粮食四百多万斤。　（吴立勋）
    扩建宣纸厂
    我国目前唯一生产宣纸的工厂——安徽省泾县宣纸厂，正在进行规模较大的改建工程。这座工厂自从实行公私合营以后，经过逐年投资扩建，产量和质量有了很大提高。但是由于解放前遭受反动政府的严重破坏，以及生产过程还是手工操作，目前的产量仅供北京荣宝斋一家包销尚感不足。根据这种情况，安徽省工业厅决定投资加以改建。
    宣纸厂的改建工程，在生产工艺方面大部分都还保留原有的特点，只是部分加以改进。如用烧碱蒸煮檀皮代替原有的长时间蒸煮方式，用打浆机代替水碓打浆的笨重劳动，并且新建七个生产车间及仓库。改建工程完成并投入生产后，宣纸的年产量将比现在增加一倍半。
    水田播种机
    吉林省长春市第四洋铁生产合作社社员刘污廷，制造水田播种机成功。
    这种播种机，人拖、手推都很灵活，地脑地头都可使用。用这种工具播水田每人每日可播二十亩左右，比现在所使用的揣把式手攀播种机效率提高三倍以上。　（霍凤山）
    自动犁
    山西省南部地区最近发现了一部自动犁。犁身只有三尺多长，犁上安装着一个一点五马力的马达，开动时只要一人扶住就能够耕地、耙地和播种。最近在浮山、临汾两县试验的结果，一天耕到八亩地，相当于新式步犁一天工作量的二倍多，成本也较低。
    中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳和科学技术人员参观以后认为，这个犁很轻便，不仅能在平川小块地上耕作，而且适合于山区梯田、坡地使用，为改革山区耕作技术提供了一种新型的工具。
    这部犁是临汾县手工业社清理仓库时发现的，据老工人们说是解放前由国外引进的样品。中共晋南地委对这个犁很重视，已交给地方国营临汾机械厂研究试制。　（新华社专稿）
