    Dozens of Machines Leave Storage, Hundreds of Drivers Go to the Countryside:
    Jiangsu Transportation and Shipping Department Actively Supports Rural Areas
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) After entering the rectification phase, the Jiangsu Province Transportation and Shipping Department studied the issue of how to support agricultural construction. In accordance with the spirit of "opposing waste and building the country through diligence and frugality," they inventoried the warehouses. To date, they have cleared out thirty-eight old ship engines and one water pump for road construction. These can be used for agricultural production or water conservancy as water pumps or other machinery. In addition, there is a batch of old car engines, which will be transferred to the agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy departments after being cleared.
    In addition to providing material support by contributing all possible resources, they also plan to transfer more than six hundred drivers and other personnel to support the agricultural front. (Bian Xiu)

    几十部机器出库数百名驾驶员下乡
    江苏交通航运厅积极支援农村
    本报讯　江苏省交通、航运厅转入整改阶段后，研究了如何支援农业建设的问题。他们根据“反对浪费、勤俭建国”的精神，清查了仓库。到目前为止，已清理出三十八部轮船用的旧引擎，一部修筑公路用的抽水机。可供农业生产或水利方面作抽水机或其他机械之用。此外，尚有一批汽车用的旧引擎，待清理以后，就将移交给农林水利部门使用。
    除了在物力方面，他们把可能拿出来的力量拿出来支援农业外，还打算抽调六百多个驾驶员和其他人员支援农业战线。　（卞修）
