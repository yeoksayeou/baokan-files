The Story of Tin
Miyang

In the winter of 1867, a strange thing happened in the customs warehouse in St. Petersburg: a large batch of tin ingots piled up in the warehouse disappeared overnight, leaving behind only gray powder like mud. That's not all. In the same winter, the tin buttons on the greatcoats of the Tsarist Russian soldiers also rotted one by one, leaving behind only some gray, mud-like substances. People were talking about it: the year was really bad, such a strange thing happened, and the weather was so cold (indeed, it was particularly cold this year, with the thermometer dropping to minus 38 degrees Celsius). Maybe God was punishing people. But some smart people thought: the tin might have frozen. The incident caused a stir for a while, but was soon forgotten.

More than forty years passed in a flash.

In 1912, a British expedition led by Scott set off for Antarctica. Before leaving, they carried excellent equipment, a large amount of supplies and liquid fuel. However, shortly after arriving in Antarctica, they were never heard from again. Months passed, and it was as if they had sunk without a trace. As a last resort, the British sent a second expedition to find Scott's team. As a result, the frozen bodies of all the members of the first expedition were found on the Antarctic ice sheet. People couldn't figure it out: why didn't so much liquid fuel help? After careful observation, everyone suddenly realized that the iron drums containing the liquid fuel had all burst, and the tin at the seams of the iron drums had turned into ash, and the fuel had naturally leaked out completely.

Scientists conducted research, and the riddle was solved: ordinary white tin begins to transform into powdery gray tin when it cools below 18 degrees Celsius. This is another crystalline form of tin. If we heat it up to above 18 degrees Celsius again, it will turn into ordinary white tin again. Of course, to return to a block of tin, it must be melted again.

In winter, the transformation of white tin into gray tin is very slow and usually not easily noticed. However, as the temperature gradually decreases, the transformation also accelerates, reaching its peak at minus 33 degrees Celsius. At this time, blocks of tin ingots can be turned into dust overnight. People call this phenomenon "tin plague." "Tin plague" is contagious. In winter, if you rub a little gray tin on a "healthy" tin utensil, it will immediately be infected.

White tin's fear of cold can be regarded as its biggest shortcoming, but it is within human power to know its ailment and take precautions. And the contribution that tin has made to human production and life far outweighs this shortcoming.

In the metallurgical industry, tin is often added to other metals as a major component to make alloys. The world-famous bronze is an alloy of tin and copper. A high-grade bearing alloy (Babbitt alloy) is composed of tin, lead, antimony, and copper. The solder used in the radio industry for circuit welding is an alloy of tin and lead. The type used in printing is also made of three metals: tin, lead, and antimony. This material has very little volume change after being heated and will not affect the printing effect due to changes in temperature. At the same time, it is more wear-resistant and easier to melt than pure lead, making it easy to recast.

Tin foil is often a high-quality material for manufacturing high-voltage capacitors in the radio industry. Although aluminum foil is also used nowadays, it is not as good as tin foil because the former has high hardness, low plasticity, and is also susceptible to corrosion.

In the glass industry, adding tin oxide is often used to make red glass. Because extremely small tin oxide particles dispersed in the glass melt can absorb other light and scatter red light.

Many brightly colored organic dyes cannot "stick" to cotton cloth. Newly dyed cloth will lose its color completely after washing it once or twice. However, if the cloth is first soaked in an aqueous solution of sodium stannate, a compound of tin, and then dyed, the situation will be very different: not only will the cloth be brightly colored, but it will never fade. Originally, sodium stannate dissolves in water and decomposes into "stannic acid." Stannic acid can be firmly absorbed by the fibers of cotton cloth. At the same time, stannic acid has a very strong ability to adsorb organic dyes, so the dye is indirectly "stuck" to the cotton cloth. That is to say, stannic acid acts as a medium, which is usually called a mordant. Although sodium stannate is not the only mordant, it is one of the most widely used.

The color of tin sulfide is almost exactly like gold, so people grind tin sulfide into powder to make high-grade gold pigments. If you put some tin amalgam, sulfur powder, and ammonium chloride mixture on an object and slowly heat it to 300 degrees Celsius, then a layer of "gold" will be plated on the surface of the object. Many gold foils are also manufactured using this similar method.

Metallic tin is non-toxic and does not rust, so tin is plated on tin cans to prevent rust. However, stale canned food is prone to poisoning after eating, because the rotten food produces organic acids. The organic acids react with tin to produce tin methane, which is a highly toxic substance.

Although animal organisms do not need much tin, they still contain 0.00001% tin in their bodies. What is almost unbelievable is that almost all of this tin is concentrated in the tongue. Soviet biochemist V.I. Vernadsky once confirmed this with experiments.

China's tin reserves are the largest in the world. At present, Gejiu in Yunnan Province is known as the "Tin Capital" because of its abundant tin production. With the widespread application of tin in industry, the development prospects of China's tin industry are immeasurable.

    锡的故事
    米扬
    1867年冬天，彼得堡海关仓库里发生了一件怪事：堆在仓库里的大批锡砖一夜间不翼而飞，剩下来的却是满仓库的像泥一样的灰色的粉末。这还不算，同年冬天，帝俄士兵大衣上的锡铸钮扣也一个个地都腐烂了，剩下来的只是一些灰色像泥一样的东西。人们纷纷在议论：今年年头实在太坏了，出了这样的怪事，天又这么冷（的确，这年冷得特别厉害，寒暑表整整降到零下三十八度），这大概是上帝在惩罚人们吧。但也有一些聪明人认为：锡可能是给冻坏的。这件事闹了一阵，不久也就被人们忘记了。
    转眼又过了四十几年。
    1912年，英国人斯高特率领的一支探险队出发到南极大陆去，临行时他们携带了优良的装备、大量的给养和液体燃料，可是到达南极后不久就音信全无了。几个月过去了，依然像石沉大海一般。不得已，英国人又派出了第二支探险队去寻找斯高特的队伍。结果在南极冰原上发现了第一支探险队全部队员冻僵了的尸体。人们百思不解：为什么带了这么多的液体燃料还不济事？经过仔细观察，大家才恍然大悟了，原来他们发现盛液体燃料的铁筒都破裂了，焊接铁筒接缝处的锡都化成了灰土，自然燃料都流得干干净净。
    科学家进行了研究，谜语被揭开了：普通的白锡冷到摄氏十八度以下就开始转变为粉末状的灰锡。这是锡的另外一种结晶。如果我们把它再加热到十八度以上，就又变成普通的白锡。当然，要回复成锡块，就非得再熔化一次不可。
    冬天，白锡转变成灰锡是很慢的，平常不易察觉；不过随着温度逐渐降低转变也加快，在零下三十三度时达到最高峰。这时可以使成块的锡砖在一夜之间化为灰土。人们把这种现象叫做“锡瘟”。“锡瘟”是传染的，冬天如果在“健康”的锡器上擦点灰锡，它立即就受到了感染。
    白锡惧寒，可算是它最大的毛病，但知其疾而加以预防是人力所及的。而锡在人类生产和生活中所作的贡献，又远远超过了它的这个缺点。
    在冶金工业中，锡经常当作一个主要成份加到别的金属中间去制成合金。举世皆知的青铜就是锡和铜的合金。一种高级的轴承合金（巴比特合金）是由锡、铅、锑、铜构成的。无线电工业中电路焊接时使用的焊锡，就是锡和铅的合金。印刷上所用的铅字，也是由锡、铅、锑三种金属熔制成的。这种材料受热后体积变化极小，不会因气温的改变而影响印刷的效果，同时它比纯铅更耐磨和易熔化，便于翻制。
    锡箔经常是无线电工业中制造耐高压电容器的优质材料。尽管目前也采用铝箔，但由于后者硬度大、塑性低，同时也易于腐蚀，所以终究不如用锡箔好。
    在玻璃工业中，经常用加入氧化锡的办法来制造红色玻璃。因为极微小的氧化锡颗粒分散在玻璃熔体中可以吸收别的光线，而将红色光散射出来。
    不少色彩鲜艳的有机染料，对于棉布来说是“粘”不上的，新染的布只要洗一两次颜色就会褪个精光。但是如果把布先放在锡的一种化合物——锡酸钠的水溶液里浸一下再染，情况就会大不相同：不但布匹色彩艳丽，并且永不脱色。原来锡酸钠溶在水里就分解出一种“锡酸”，锡酸能被棉布的纤维牢牢吸住，同时锡酸吸附有机染料的本领又非常强，因此染料就间接地被“粘”在棉布上了。这就是说，锡酸起了一种媒介作用，通常就称它为媒染剂。虽然媒染剂并不只锡酸钠一种，但它是被用得比较广泛的。
    硫化锡的颜色简直和黄金一般无二，因此人们就把硫化锡磨成粉做成高级的金色颜料。假如在物件上放些锡汞齐、硫黄粉和氯化铵的混合物，再慢慢加热到摄氏三百度的话，那就会在物件的表面上镀上一层“黄金”。不少金箔也就是利用这种类似的方法制造的。
    金属锡没有毒、不生锈，所以罐头筒上都镀锡防锈。可是陈腐的罐头食后却易中毒，这是因为腐烂的食品产生了有机酸，有机酸和锡作用生成了锡甲烷，锡甲烷是剧毒性物质。
    尽管动物的机体并不怎么需要锡，可是在身体内依然含有0.00001％的锡。说起来简直令人难以置信的，是这些锡几乎全部都集中在舌头里。苏联一位生物化学家В·И·伏叶尔那德斯基曾经用实验证实了这点。
    我国锡的储量是世界第一，目前云南个旧就因锡产丰富而有“锡都”之称。随着锡在工业上的广泛应用，我国锡业的发展前途将不可限量。
