	Resolutely Draw a Line Between Ourselves and Rightists
	Taiwan Compatriots in Beijing Indignantly Denounce Xie Xuehong
	Xinhua News Agency, 6th -- Taiwan compatriots and returned overseas Chinese from Taiwan Province in Beijing held a meeting at the headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League this afternoon, denouncing the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of the rightist Xie Xuehong with utmost indignation.
	The meeting lasted from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m., with speakers vying to take the floor. A total of twenty-seven people spoke at the meeting. They unanimously pointed out that Xie Xuehong was a disgrace to the people of Taiwan and resolutely expressed their determination to draw a line between themselves and her politically and ideologically, and demanded that the headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League seriously deal with Xie Xuehong's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes.
	Chen Dingmao, an engineering technician who returned from Taiwan and is now a People's Representative of a district in Beijing, said at the meeting that the people of Taiwan have deeply realized from countless bloody struggles against imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique that they cannot be liberated without the leadership of the Communist Party. The reason why many Taiwan compatriots returned to the mainland of the motherland from Taiwan is precisely because they love the motherland and support the leadership of the Communist Party. The rightist Xie Xuehong said that the people of Taiwan have no good feelings towards the Communist Party, which is the greatest insult to the people of Taiwan. Hong Jinshan, who returned from Japan the year before last and is now studying at the Marxism-Leninism Research Class of the Renmin University of China, said that Xie Xuehong's reactionary political views and organizational line completely violated the will of the people of Taiwan. In order to realize her personal shameful political ambitions, she attempted to alienate returned overseas Chinese from Taiwan from the Communist Party and the People's Government, which is a very serious crime. Xie Nanguang, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, pointed out that Xie Xuehong has consistently shielded traitors and counter-revolutionaries, painstakingly opposed the leadership of the Party, and undermined the unity of Taiwan compatriots with the people of the motherland. We must thoroughly draw a line between ourselves and her so that the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League can better serve the liberation of Taiwan and the socialist construction of the motherland.
	Chen Liansheng, a Gaoshan ethnic cadre working at the Central Institute for Nationalities, and Gaoshan ethnic students Tian Zhongshan, Li Hemin, director of the Central Institute of Biological Products, Chen Musen, a member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and others, pointed out at the meeting with their personal experiences that all Taiwan compatriots and returned overseas Chinese from Taiwan Province on the mainland have been properly resettled by the People's Government, and many have also assumed leadership positions in different posts, thoroughly refuting Xie Xuehong's lie that the People's Government does not trust Taiwan compatriots. Li Hemin said that he not only received great trust from the leadership in his work, but also the People's Government sent him to the Soviet Union to study. Chen Liansheng said that the people of Taiwan suffered deeply from the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the Gaoshan people suffered even more. All Taiwan compatriots, including the Gaoshan people, love the big family of all ethnic groups in the motherland and hope to return to the embrace of the socialist motherland as soon as possible, and will never allow Xie Xuehong to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Huang Wenzhe, a doctor at the Beijing Children's Hospital and a director of the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that Xie Xuehong incited us not to have the leadership of the Communist Party and not to love the motherland. If we listened to her, we would be playing into the hands of the U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.
	At the meeting, many returned overseas Chinese from Taiwan Province and Taiwan compatriots who had been in contact with Xie Xuehong in the past also revealed a large number of facts, proving that Xie Xuehong had taken advantage of some Taiwan compatriots' lack of understanding of the situation in the motherland to spread a large number of rumors, tout her personal so-called "heroic history", attack the leftists in the leadership of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, and sow discord, in order to create capital for the realization of her personal political ambitions. Some Taiwan compatriots who personally participated in the "February 28th" uprising also revealed at the meeting all kinds of ugly facts about Xie Xuehong's sheltering of the enemy and fleeing in panic at that time. Chen Fenglong from the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives revealed that Xie Xuehong had recommended a booklet written by the rightist Yang Kehuang that touted Xie Xuehong herself and distorted the history of the struggle of the people of Taiwan to him, saying that it was the most reliable book and asked him to translate it into Japanese for propaganda abroad. Wang Hongde from the Beijing No. 1 Automobile Parts Factory said that he had recently applied for a request to go to the countryside, and Xie Xuehong not only did not encourage him, but also tried to stop him, saying that it was "a pity" for someone like him to "go to the countryside."
	It was revealed at the meeting that even after the headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League had thoroughly exposed and criticized Xie Xuehong's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, she was still spreading various rumors among Taiwan compatriots in Beijing and returned overseas Chinese from Taiwan Province, slandering the anti-rightist struggle, and attempting to counterattack. Xie Xuehong's bad attitude of resisting the crime and stubbornly resisting aroused great indignation among all the participants.
	Taiwan compatriots from various places have also sent many letters to the headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, exposing and denouncing Xie Xuehong's anti-Party crimes.

    坚决同右派分子划清界限
    在京台湾同胞愤慨声讨谢雪红
    新华社6日讯　在北京的台湾同胞和台湾省籍的归国华侨今天下午在台湾民主自治同盟总部举行集会，以无比的愤慨声讨右派分子谢雪红的反党反社会主义罪行。
    会议从下午二时一直开到晚上八点，发言的人争先恐后。在会上发言的共有二十七人。他们一致指出谢雪红是台湾人民的败类，坚决表示要同她在政治上思想上划清界限，并要求台盟总部对谢雪红的反党反社会主义罪行做出严肃处理。
    从台湾归来的工程技术人员、现任北京市区人民代表的陈丁茂在会上说，台湾人民从同帝国主义和蒋介石集团的无数流血斗争中，深刻地体会到如果没有共产党的领导，决不能得到解放。许多台湾同胞所以从台湾回到祖国大陆，正是因为他们热爱祖国和拥护共产党的领导。右派分子谢雪红说台湾人民对共产党没有好感，这是对台湾人民的最大侮辱。前年从日本回国、现在中国人民大学马列主义研究班学习的洪进山说，谢雪红的反动政治主张和组织路线，完全违背了台湾人民的意志。她为了实现个人可耻的政治野心，企图离间归国台湾籍华侨同共产党与人民政府的关系，这是非常严重的罪行。全国政协委员谢南光指出，谢雪红一贯地包庇汉奸和反革命分子，处心积虑地反对党的领导，破坏台湾同胞同祖国人民的团结，我们一定要和她彻底划清界限，使台盟组织更好地为解放台湾和祖国的社会主义建设服务。
    现在中央民族学院工作的高山族干部陈连生和高山族学员田中山、中央生物制品研究所主任技师李河民、北京市政协委员陈木森等人，在会上以他们的亲身经历，指出所有在大陆的台湾同胞和台湾籍华侨回国后都得到了人民政府的妥善安置，不少人还在不同的岗位上担任了领导工作，彻底驳斥了谢雪红所说人民政府不信任台湾同胞的谎言。李河民说他不仅在工作中得到领导上的很大信任，并且人民政府还曾把他送到苏联去学习。陈连生说，台湾人民深受帝国主义和国民党反动派的压迫，高山族人民受害更深。所有台湾同胞包括高山族在内，都热爱祖国各民族的大家庭，希望早日回到社会主义祖国的怀抱，决不容许谢雪红进行反党反社会主义活动。北京市儿童医院医生、北京市归国华侨联合会理事黄文哲说，谢雪红煽动我们不要共产党的领导，不要热爱祖国，如果我们听了她的话，就正中了美帝国主义和蒋介石集团的心意。
    会上，许多过去曾经和谢雪红接触过的台湾省籍归国华侨和台湾同胞，还揭发了大量事实，证明谢雪红曾经利用某些台湾同胞对祖国情况了解不够的情况，散布大量流言蜚语，吹嘘她个人的所谓“英雄历史”，打击台盟领导中的左派，挑拨离间，以便为实现她个人的政治野心制造资本。有些亲自参加“二·二八”起义的台湾同胞，也在会上揭发了谢雪红当时包庇敌人和仓惶逃跑的种种丑恶事实。全国供销合作总社陈凤龙揭露，谢雪红曾经把右派分子杨克煌写的一本为谢雪红本人吹嘘，歪曲台湾人民斗争历史的小册子推荐给他，说是一本最可靠的书，要他翻译成日文，向国外宣传。北京第一汽车附件厂王鸿德说，他在最近申请要求下放，谢雪红不但不加鼓励，反而进行阻止，说是像他这样的人“下放太可惜”。
    会上揭露，直到台盟总部对谢雪红的反党反社会主义罪行进行了彻底揭露和批判以后，她还在北京的台湾同胞和归国的台湾省籍华侨中散布各种谣言，污蔑反右派斗争，企图反扑。谢雪红这种抵赖罪行进行顽抗的恶劣态度，激起了所有与会者的极大愤慨。
    各地台湾同胞也给台盟总部寄来很多信件，揭发和声讨谢雪红的反党罪行。
