Leading Ideology Clear, Work Arrangements Appropriate
    Wuqiang County Promotes Production and Rectification Mutually

    (Our report) The first batch of fifty-one villages (collectives) in Wuqiang County, Hebei Province, that underwent rectification, completed their work successively in mid-December before the new year. This rectification was carried out simultaneously with the movements of fighting drought, sowing wheat, watering wheat, water conservancy construction, and accumulating fertilizer. Throughout the entire movement, unified leadership, comprehensive arrangements, division of responsibility, and close integration were implemented. Not only was the rectification progress fast and of high quality, completed according to the scheduled time, but it also set off a new upsurge in production. Among these fifty-one villages, forty-nine villages were ahead of the villages that had not yet undergone rectification in terms of production.

    How did Wuqiang County manage to promote production and rectification mutually?

    The most important thing is that the leading ideology must be clear: rectification is the driving force for the great leap in production; doing a good job in rectification will eliminate obstacles to production and promote production forward. At the beginning of the movement, from the work teams to the village branches, many people lacked confidence in the county party committee's requirement of "closely integrating rectification and production, being responsible to the end, and promoting each other," believing that "what is said is one thing, and what is done is another; engaging in rectification will affect production, and engaging in production will hinder rectification." The actual implementation also showed that rectification and production were not integrated. As a result, it was not conducive to the development of the rectification movement, and it also affected the progress of production work. For example, in Daguo Village, rectification was once squeezed out by drought resistance and wheat planting; as a result, wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas shouted about a shortage of grain, the masses' production enthusiasm was low, and the resistance to production was great. After discovering this situation, the county party committee immediately held a rural grassroots rectification meeting. At the meeting, a debate was launched on the relationship between rectification and production, mobilizing everyone to voice their opinions and contend. After the debate, the "one-sided" thinking that "cadres cannot be in two places at once, and if they manage this, they cannot manage that" was criticized. Most cadres realized that rectification is the driving force for promoting a great leap in production. In order to strengthen the unified leadership of rectification and production, the county party committee determined that the first secretary should grasp both rectification and production; the party committees and village branches of each township also formed a core leadership group headed by the secretary and composed of relevant personnel to comprehensively lead rectification and production. After this meeting, the phenomenon of production squeezing out rectification was reversed.

    From the perspective of work methods, unified leadership, comprehensive arrangements, and division of responsibility must be implemented to ensure that the two major movements are closely integrated. The rectification work team took charge of both rectification and production, and under the unified leadership of the core group, they divided responsibilities. In general, in each township, the party committee secretary or deputy secretary and the Communist Youth League committee secretary were responsible for rectification; the secretary or deputy secretary and the township head or deputy township head were responsible for production. In each village, the party branch secretary, the Communist Youth League branch secretary, and the deputy political director of the cooperative were responsible for rectification; the village director and other directors and deputy directors of the cooperative, and branch committee members were responsible for production. The members of the core group in each village were divided into teams to comprehensively be responsible for production and rectification; each production team had party members and activists, and the production team was also a forum group. In this way, it was possible to unify will, unify arrangements, quickly focus on studying the situation and solving problems, and ensure that the two major movements promoted each other.

    Throughout the rectification movement, rectification and improvement must be carried out conscientiously. At the beginning of the movement, they paid attention to rectifying while voicing opinions. During the movement, 187 cooperative and team cadres accepted the opinions of the members and went to the fields to produce; 102 cadres accepted criticism and changed their rigid work style; 36 agricultural cooperatives, based on the opinions of the masses, revised the labor quotas and overcame the phenomena of unequal pay for equal work and unreasonable work point recording; 31 agricultural cooperatives cleared up and announced their accounts. As a result, the relationship between cadres and the masses became closer, and production enthusiasm was even higher.

    Time must be allocated reasonably. Their approach was generally to produce during the day and voice opinions at night. For issues that needed to be resolved in meetings, they made full preparations in advance and tried to shorten the time as much as possible. During the critical stage of the drought resistance, wheat planting, wheat watering, water conservancy, and fertilizer accumulation movements, in addition to organizing the elderly to continue voicing opinions, male and female laborers were organized into rectification and production integration groups according to production needs, turning the production site into a forum for debate, resolving the contradiction between rectification and production in terms of time. In this way, a total of more than 78,000 problems were voiced during production, accounting for 44.2% of the total. Necessary debate meetings were held during the rest time when the masses were concentrated in production (such as digging canals, digging ponds, etc.). When entering the organizational construction phase, the production teams became groups for deliberating candidates, and the concentrated production sites became election venues. Thirty-six agricultural cooperatives elected member representatives at the production site. These practices not only solved the contradiction between rectification and production in terms of time, but also directly and powerfully promoted the production movement, enabling the masses to participate in the rectification movement with full enthusiasm.

### 领导思想明确　工作安排得当  武强县生产整风互相促进

    领导思想明确　工作安排得当
    武强县生产整风互相促进
    本报讯　河北省武强县第一批进行整风的五十一个村（社），已在年前12月中旬先后结束。这次整风是同抗旱、种麦、浇麦、水利建设、积肥运动同时进行的。在整个运动中，统一领导，全面安排，分工负责，密切结合，不但整风进度快质量高，按照预定时间完成，并且在生产上掀起了新的高潮。这五十一个村中，有四十九个村在生产上走在尚未整风的村的前面。
    武强县是怎样作到整风生产互相促进的呢？
    最重要的是领导思想必须明确：整风是生产大跃进的动力；搞好整风，就会扫除生产上的障碍，推动生产向前发展。在运动开始的时候，从工作组到村支部，许多人对县委提出的“整风生产紧密结合，一包到底，互相推动”的要求缺乏信心，认为“说是说作是作，搞整风就得影响生产，搞生产就得妨碍整风”。实际执行的情况也是整风和生产互不结合。结果，既不利于整风运动的开展，也影响了生产工作的进行。例如大郭庄村，整风一度被抗旱种麦挤掉；结果，资本主义思想严重的富裕中农大喊缺粮，群众生产情绪低落，对生产的阻力很大。县委发觉这个情况以后，立即召开了农村基层整风会议。会上就整风生产的关系问题，发动大家展开了鸣放辩论。经过争辩，批判了“干部不能分身，管这就不能管那”的单打一的思想，大部分干部认识到整风是促进生产大跃进的动力。为了加强整风和生产的统一领导，县委确定第一书记要一手抓整风一手抓生产；各乡党委和村支部，也都以书记为首吸收有关人员组成整风生产领导核心小组，全面领导整风和生产。经过这次会议，生产挤掉整风的现象扭转了。
    从工作方法上来看，必须实行统一领导、全面安排、分工负责，才能保证两大运动密切结合。整风工作组把整风和生产都抓起来，并在核心小组的统一领导下分工负责。各乡一般都由党委书记或副书记、团委书记负责整风；书记或副书记和正副乡长负责生产。各村是党支部书记、团支部书记、政治副社长负责整风；村主任和其它正副社长、支部委员负责生产。各村核心组的成员分头包队，全面负责生产和整风；各个生产小组都有党员和积极分子，生产小组同时也就是鸣放小组。这样，就能够统一意志，统一安排，迅速地集中研究情况、解决问题，保证了两大运动互相推动。
    在整风运动中自始至终都要认真进行整改。运动开始，他们就注意边鸣边改。在运动中，有一百八十七个社队干部，接受了社员意见下地生产；有一百零二个干部接受批评改变了生硬作风；有三十六个农业社，根据群众意见，修改了劳动定额，克服了同工不同酬、记工不合理的现象；有三十一个农业社清理并公布了账目。这样一来，干群关系更加密切了，生产情绪更为高涨了。
    必须合理地支配时间。他们的作法：一般的是白天生产，晚上鸣放。对于需要开会解决的问题，事先作好充分准备，尽量缩短时间。在抗旱种麦、浇麦、水利积肥运动的突击阶段，除组织老年人继续进行鸣放以外，男女劳力都根据生产需要编成了整风生产结合小组，把生产现场变为鸣辩会场，解决了整风和生产在时间上的矛盾。这样在生产中鸣出各种问题共七万八千多条，占总数的44.2％。必要的辩论大会，是利用群众集中生产（如开渠、挖塘等）的休息时间来举行。进入组织建设阶段的时候，生产小组又变为酝酿候选人的小组会，集中生产的场合成了选举会场。有三十六个农业社是在生产现场选出了社员代表。这些做法，不仅解决了整风和生产时间上的矛盾，而且使整风运动直接地有力地推动了生产运动，使社员群众始终以饱满的热情参加了整风运动。
