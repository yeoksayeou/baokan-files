Reader's Words:

    Talking From My Heart
    I am a student at the Peking University Affiliated Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Middle School. I excitedly and carefully read and reread the article published on page seven of the People's Daily regarding "Further Implementing the Policy of 'Opening Higher Education to Workers and Peasants.'" I believe this article speaks from our hearts.
    Since liberation, our country has proposed the policy that institutions of higher learning must "open their doors to workers and peasants." In order to cultivate worker-peasant intellectuals, the state has not only vigorously developed spare-time education, but also established many worker-peasant accelerated middle schools throughout the country, so that we, the children of workers and peasants who were deprived of the right to attend middle school and university for generations, have also gained good learning opportunities. We deeply realize that this is determined by our superior social system. Therefore, we love our people's regime even more.
    At present, we are working hard with full confidence, preparing to enter university. However, judging from the results of last year's university entrance examination, we feel very disappointed. Because only two of the more than eighty graduates from our school who participated in the exam were admitted, which is such an astonishing number! Under such circumstances, can our urgent desire to go to school be realized? This is a question that we are always concerned about.
    Of course, it is right to value academic performance, but politics and professional competence should be combined even more. Although some of our academic performance is not as good as that of ordinary middle schools, there should also be sufficient consideration for our perseverance in studying hard! 　Jin Wenyi

### 谈谈我的心里话

    谈谈我的心里话
    我是北京大学附设工农速成中学的学生。我兴奋而又仔细地反复阅读了人民日报七版刊登的关于“进一步贯彻高等学校向‘工农开门’的方针”一文，我认为这篇文章是说出了我们的心里话。
    解放后，我们国家就提出了高等学校必须向“工农开门”的方针，为了培养工农知识分子，国家除大力发展业余教育外，还在全国举办了许多工农速成中学，使得我们这些历代被剥夺上中学、进大学权利的工农子弟，也获得了良好的学习机会。我们深深地体会到这是我们优越的社会制度所决定的。因此，我们更加热爱我们的人民政权。
    目前，我们正信心百倍地努力学习着，准备考入大学。但是，从去年的大学招生考试的结果看来，我们感到很失望。因为我们学校参加考试的八十多位毕业生只考上了两名，这是多么令人惊讶的数字呀！在这样的情况下，我们迫切要求升学的愿望是否能实现呢？这是我们时刻关心的问题。
    当然，重视学业成绩是应该的，但是，更应该把政治和业务结合起来。虽然我们某些学业成绩比不上普通中学，可是对我们刻苦学习的毅力也应该有足够的估计啊！　金雯漪
