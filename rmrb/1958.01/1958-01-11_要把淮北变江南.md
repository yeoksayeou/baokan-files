	Transforming Northern Anhui into Jiangnan
	By Our Reporter Yú Míng
	People who frequently travel on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway can easily notice a new change taking place in the area north of the Huai River in the past two years: more and more rice paddies have appeared in the vast dryland crop area of ​​Northern Anhui. It tells people that the farmers of Northern Anhui are carrying out the great work of transforming nature. Their slogan is: Transform Northern Anhui into Jiangnan!
	Northern Anhui has 45 million mu of cultivated land and is one of China's important dryland grain-producing areas. However, the yield of dryland crops here is very low. Wheat, soybeans, and sorghum generally only yield a little over 100 jin per mu. In many low-lying areas, only one season of wheat was grown in the past. After the wheat harvest, due to waterlogging, no second crop was planted, and the land could not be fully utilized. Not only is the yield of dryland crops in Northern Anhui low, but they are also often not guaranteed due to waterlogging. However, another situation in Northern Anhui is that the average temperature from April to October is around 23 degrees Celsius, and the frost-free period is around 230 to 240 days, which not only allows for the cultivation of rice but also double-cropping of rice. The average annual rainfall in Northern Anhui is about 800 millimeters, most of which is concentrated in July, August, and September when rice needs water. The water source is also abundant. Not only is there water from the Huai River, but groundwater also gushes out when dug a few meters deep, which can be used to convert to large-scale rice cultivation.
	The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China seized this key to increasing production by converting to rice cultivation. In the "Three Conversions" method proposed a few years ago, it called on farmers to combine flood control with conversion. By now, the area converted to rice cultivation in Northern Anhui has reached more than one million mu, which has pointed out a path for Northern Anhui to transform from low-yield to high-yield and from disaster-prone to disaster-free.
	The benefits of converting to rice cultivation in Northern Anhui are already very clear. The yield of more than one million mu of rice is generally one to two times higher than that of dryland crops. In 1956, Fuyang County planted more than 130,000 mu of rice in low-lying areas. In that year, there was a major flood, and 80% of the land suffered reduced production due to the disaster. However, the average yield of this rice was still 224 jin per mu. If dryland crops were planted, there would have been no harvest at all. The Fufeng Eighth Cooperative of the county converted 153 mu to spring-sown rice, with a yield of 657 jin per mu. In Linquan County, Xiaozhangzhuang of the Yan Agricultural Cooperative planted 38 mu of rice this year, yielding 914 jin per mu. The production and living standards of the farmers in this village have exceeded the level of wealthy middle peasants in the area. Conversion to rice cultivation has gradually eliminated the phenomenon that no second crop was planted after the wheat harvest in the past. Planting a season of rice after the wheat harvest not only effectively utilizes the accumulated water on the ground and controls waterlogging, but also yields one or even several times more than the first season of wheat! The masses praised the conversion to rice cultivation, saying: "The rice conversion method is strong, dry land becomes a granary, one mu yields the grain of three mu." In the past, people in Northern Anhui only weighed one or two jin of rice as a valuable gift when visiting relatives, celebrating weddings, and when children were born. Now, many people can usually eat rice they grow themselves.
	Conversion to rice cultivation can not only greatly increase grain production but also greatly save grain. In the area south of the Huai River, generally raising a cow only requires a few dozen jin of grain feed in the winter, and the rest of the time they eat rice straw; while once you cross the Huai River to Northern Anhui, a cow requires several hundred jin of grain to feed. Now that there are areas with rice in Northern Anhui, cows eat rice straw, which greatly saves grain. Seeing this benefit, the masses praised: "Conversion is good, conversion is good, we harvest grain and harvest straw, people eat rice, cows eat straw, it's tiring when planting, but we laugh when harvesting." Due to the conversion to rice cultivation, the habit of extensive planting and low yield of farmers in Northern Anhui is also gradually changing, and they are beginning to pay attention to intensive cultivation and fertilization.
	Although Northern Anhui has natural conditions for converting dry land into paddy fields, there are still resistance from conservative thinking and many technical difficulties. Because the local leaders actively solve specific problems and use the facts of increased production for publicity and education, this resistance and difficulty are gradually being overcome. In order to help the farmers in Northern Anhui convert to rice cultivation, the Anhui Party and government leaders utilized the province's favorable conditions. Since 1953, they have transferred cadres and experienced farmers from the rice-producing areas along the Yangtze River to Northern Anhui as "rice conversion teachers." Just in the year before last, more than 9,000 farmers were transferred to various counties in Northern Anhui. In Northern Anhui, they not only imparted technology but also used the rich and beautiful scenery of Jiangnan to point out the equally beautiful future prospects of Northern Anhui to the farmers of Northern Anhui, becoming professional propagandists who inspired people to transform nature. Northern Anhui also regularly organizes cadres and farmers to visit and learn about rice cultivation along the Yangtze River. When they return to Northern Anhui, they naturally become active promoters of rice conversion. This work has not only provided technical support for rice conversion in Northern Anhui but also laid an ideological foundation among cadres and farmers, so that many difficulties can be solved more easily.
	In the past, the farmers in Northern Anhui believed that the local area was leaky soil and could not retain water in the ground, so rice could not be grown. However, after several years of recent experiments, they built field ridges in the ground, compacted them with stone rollers and hammers, and then used mud to coat them to prevent the ridges from leaking water. Then, they used the "level dry, leak wet" method of land preparation. First, they plowed and harrowed in dry land, took high to supplement low, leveled the field surface, and then watered and repeatedly plowed and harrowed the fields to make the mud in the fields as fine and even as the paddy fields in Jiangnan, so that the fields would not leak water and could generally retain water for eight or nine days.
	Because Northern Anhui has a lot of land and a shortage of labor and livestock, and the summer harvest is also the season for transplanting seedlings, some people are worried that they will be too busy. Local leaders have helped farmers make early arrangements in the seedling season, and summer harvest crops are planted with early-maturing varieties, so that the harvest time is staggered. In the past, the farmers in Northern Anhui were worried that there would not be enough water for growing rice. Now, many ditches and canals that were originally only for drainage have been blocked and turned into water conservancy projects that combine drainage and storage, with storage as the main focus, which can supply the needs of rice. Recently, an important work they are carrying out is to dig deep ponds and underground springs to utilize groundwater. The Renmin No. 1 Cooperative of Bo County dug a large pond on four mu of land and used the pond water to convert 117 mu of rice. The spring-sown rice yielded an average of 711 jin per mu, and the wheat stubble rice planted after the wheat harvest still yielded an average of 309 jin per mu. These facts have strengthened the confidence of the farmers in Northern Anhui to convert to rice cultivation. Now, the farmers in Northern Anhui are no longer opposed to converting to rice cultivation, but are actively demanding to convert to rice cultivation. For example, the members of the Taoshan No. 1 Cooperative in Su County raised three major opinions to the cooperative, one of which was that the cooperative did not complete the rice conversion plan last year.
	The National Agricultural Development Program stipulates that the country "should increase rice by 250 million mu within twelve years starting from 1956." To realize this program, the Northern Anhui region, which is close to the original rice-producing area, has more favorable conditions. According to estimates, the large, medium, and small water conservancy projects and land in Northern Anhui are all planned to store water, which can store hundreds of billions of cubic meters of water for conversion to rice cultivation in the future. As long as people work hard, it is possible to transform tens of millions of mu of low-yield dry land into high-yield paddy fields. The plans of various counties in Northern Anhui are working hard in this direction. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the plans of many counties require that one-third to one-half of the county's land be converted into paddy fields through water conservancy construction. This year, the area converted to rice cultivation in various counties in Northern Anhui will increase two times than last year, reaching more than 3 million mu. Now the farmers in Northern Anhui are particularly enthusiastic about water conservancy construction. From last winter to this spring to the present, they have completed 800 million cubic meters of earthwork, far exceeding the total amount of earthwork for farmland water conservancy projects done in the area since liberation eight years ago. Judging from this enthusiasm, it can be expected that in a few years, they will definitely be able to waterlog Northern Anhui, plant rice everywhere, and transform the disaster-prone Northern Anhui into as rich and beautiful as Jiangnan.

    要把淮北变江南
    本报记者　于明
    常坐津浦车的人们，稍微留意一下便可发现，近二年来淮河以北地区正在发生着新的变化：一望无际的淮北旱粮产区，出现了越来越多的水稻田。它告诉人们，淮北农民正在进行改造自然的伟大工作。他们的口号是：要把淮北变江南！
    淮北有四千五百万亩耕地，是我国重要旱粮产区之一。但是，这里的旱粮作物产量很低，小麦、黄豆、高粱，一般每亩只能收到一百多斤。许多较为低洼的地区，过去只种一季小麦，收麦以后便因水涝不再种第二季庄稼，土地不能充分利用。淮北的旱粮作物不但产量低，而且经常因涝不能保收。可是，淮北的另外一个情况则是，每年从4月到10月的平均温度在二十三度左右，无霜期在二百三十天到二百四十天左右，不仅能种水稻，还有种双季稻的条件。淮北每年的平均雨量有八百公厘左右，大部分集中在水稻需要水的7、8、9月。水源也很充足，不但有淮河的水，地下水也只要挖几公尺深便涌出来，可以大量改种水稻。
    中共安徽省委抓住了这个改种水稻的增产关键，在早几年提出的“三改”办法中，便号召农民结合治涝进行改种。到现在全淮北改种水稻的面积已达到一百多万亩，它为淮北指出了从低产变高产，从多灾变无灾的道路。
    淮北改种水稻的好处，在目前看得已经很清楚了。一百多万亩水稻的产量，一般都比旱粮作物高一倍到两倍。阜阳县1956年在低洼地区种了十三万多亩水稻，当年大涝，80％的土地都因灾减了产，而这些水稻每亩的平均产量还收到二百二十四斤。如种旱粮，则会颗粒无收。该县阜丰八社改种春种水稻一百五十三亩，亩产六百五十七斤。临泉县阎农业社小张庄今年种了三十八亩水稻，每亩收九百一十四斤。这个庄上的农民生产和生活水平都超过了当地富裕中农的水平。改种水稻使过去麦后不再种第二季庄稼的现象逐渐消灭。麦收后再种一季水稻，不但有效地利用了地上积水，治了涝灾，而且第二季水稻比第一季小麦可多收一倍甚至几倍！群众称道改种水稻说：“稻改办法强，旱地变粮仓，一亩收了三亩粮。”过去淮北群众只有走亲戚庆贺婚嫁和生了小孩，才秤一、二斤大米当贵重礼物，现在许多人平常就可以吃自己种的大米了。
    改种水稻不但能大量增产粮食，还能大量节约粮食。在淮河以南的地区，一般养一条牛只要粮食饲料几十斤在冬天喂喂，其余时间都吃稻草；而一过淮河到淮北，一条牛就要几百斤粮食来喂。现在淮北有了水稻的地区，牛吃稻草便大量节约了粮食。群众看到这个好处，称赞道：“改种好，改种好，又收粮，又收草，人吃米，牛吃草，种时累，收时笑。”由于改种水稻，淮北农民广种薄收的习惯也正在逐步改变，开始注意精耕细作和积肥。
    淮北虽有改旱地为水田的自然条件，但是还有保守思想的抵制和技术上的许多困难。由于当地领导方面积极解决具体问题，又用增产事实进行宣传教育，这种抵制和困难正在逐步被克服。为了帮助淮北农民改种水稻，安徽党政领导利用了本省的有利条件，从1953年起，便由沿江稻产区调干部和有经验的农民，到淮北作“稻改老师”，只前年一年便调了九千多农民到淮北各县。他们在淮北不但传授了技术，还用江南丰饶美丽的景象，给淮北农民指出淮北未来同样的美好远景，成为鼓舞人们改造自然的专业宣传员。淮北各地还经常组织干部和农民，到沿江去参观和学习种水稻，他们回到淮北也自然地变成了推动稻改的积极分子。这些工作，使淮北的稻改，不但有了技术依靠，而且在干部和农民中有了思想基础，这样许多困难便比较容易解决了。
    淮北农民过去认为当地是漏风土，地里存不住水，不能种水稻。但是经过最近几年的试验，他们在地里筑了田埂，用石硪和榔头砸实，再用浠泥沾贴，先使田埂不漏水。然后就用“干整平、湿整漏”的整地方法，先在干土地里翻犁，细耙，取高补低，整平田面，再上水反复犁耙和田，把田里的泥和得和江南的水田一样匀细，使田里也不漏水，一般能存水八、九天。
    淮北因为土地多，劳畜力缺，夏收时又正是栽秧的季节，所以有些群众顾虑忙不过来，各地领导便帮助农民在育秧季节上早作安排，夏收作物多种早熟品种，使收获时间有先有后，这样就把农活错开了。淮北农民过去顾虑种水稻的水不够用，现在把许多原来只为排水的沟、渠拦起来，变成排蓄兼备，以蓄为主的水利工程，便能供应水稻的需要，最近他们进行着的一项重要工作，便是挖深塘下泉，利用地下水。亳县人民一社挖了四亩地的一个大塘，利用塘水改种了一百一十七亩水稻，春种的水稻平均亩产七百一十一斤，收麦后又种的麦茬水稻，平均亩产还达到三百零九斤。这些事实，坚定了淮北农民改种水稻的信心。现在淮北农民已经不是反对改种水稻，而是积极要求改种水稻了。如宿县桃山一社社员对社里提了三大意见，其中一项便是社里去年没有完成改种水稻计划。
    全国农业发展纲要中规定，全国“从1956年起，在十二年内，要求增加稻谷二亿五千万亩。”实现这个纲要，在靠近原来水稻产区的淮北地区，有着更为有利的条件。据估计，淮北大中小水利工程及地面都进行有计划的蓄水，将来可蓄起成百亿公方的水供改种水稻之用，只要人们积极努力，便有可能把几千万亩的低产旱地，改变成高产水田。淮北各县的规划正是朝着这个方向努力的。在第二个五年计划期间，许多县的规划都要求通过兴修水利，把全县三分之一到二分之一的土地改成水田。今年淮北各县改种水稻的面积，将比去年增加两倍，达到三百多万亩。现在淮北农民兴修水利的劲头特别大。他们从去冬今春到目前为止，已完成八亿土方工程，远远超过了该地区解放八年来所做的农田水利工程土方数的总和。从这种劲头看来，可以预期，在不多几年内，他们一定能够把淮北水网化，到处种水稻，把多灾的淮北改变成和江南一样的富饶美丽。
