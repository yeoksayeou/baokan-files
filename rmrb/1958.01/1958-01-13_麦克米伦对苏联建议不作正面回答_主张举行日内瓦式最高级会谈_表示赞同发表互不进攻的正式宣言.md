Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 12th - British Prime Minister Macmillan held a farewell press conference here this afternoon, the 11th, after his four-day visit to India, answering reporters' questions on holding summit meetings and other issues.

Since Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin's recent proposal to hold a summit meeting within the next two or three months has won such warm support from the people of the world, Macmillan, when answering questions about his views on this proposal, avoided giving a straight, direct answer. However, he began by criticizing that Bulganin's proposal included too many countries participating in the meeting, saying, "In this way, the peak becomes a mountain range with too many peaks." He said, "There are two kinds of meetings, one with twenty to forty people participating in debates, and the other is a meeting of a small group of people, which can do some practical things." "When we first talked about summit talks, what I had in mind was a meeting like the one in Geneva in 1955, that is, the four allied countries or maybe one or two more countries."

Macmillan then emphasized the need for so-called "full diplomatic preparation" before holding such a meeting. He said that before holding a summit meeting, "there should at least be a foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the agenda," and "even before that, it is very likely that the agenda will be discussed through ambassadors and diplomatic channels. Otherwise, you run the risk of doing something that will lead to disappointment."

When asked if he thought the Soviet proposal to convene a summit meeting was "just propaganda," Macmillan said, "I don't think people should see these kinds of things as propaganda."

Referring to his suggestion in a radio address on the eve of his departure to sign a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union as a starting point for an overall solution, he said that he stood by this suggestion and had not withdrawn it. But he said, "We need to use actions to reduce all those conventional and unconventional weapons as a starting point." He expressed his support for issuing a formal declaration of non-aggression, "no matter what form this declaration takes."

Macmillan talked a lot about the so-called "balance of power" theory, using it to defend the West's policy of strength. He said that during disarmament, this balance should be maintained and no one side should be allowed to dominate.

A reporter asked why the British government allowed the use of British soil as a missile base. He said that since 1947, bombers carrying atomic bombs and later hydrogen bombs have been stationed in Britain. He defended himself by saying, "Missiles are just another form of bomber."

He wanted to express a non-interventionist attitude on the West Irian issue. But he said, "Actions taken without consultation may cause damage and adverse consequences to Indonesia."

Xinhua News Agency, 12th - British Prime Minister Macmillan concluded his visit to India today, left New Delhi, and arrived in Karachi.

During his four-day visit, Macmillan exchanged views with Indian Prime Minister Nehru on international affairs and issues of common concern to the two countries. He also held separate talks with the Indian cabinet ministers of Home Affairs, Defense, Finance, and Industry and Commerce.

### 麦克米伦对苏联建议不作正面回答  主张举行日内瓦式最高级会谈  表示赞同发表互不进攻的正式宣言

    麦克米伦对苏联建议不作正面回答
    主张举行日内瓦式最高级会谈
    表示赞同发表互不进攻的正式宣言
    据新华社新德里12日电　英国首相麦克米伦11日下午在这里举行了他在印度四天访问后的临别记者招待会，回答了记者们向他提出的关于举行最高级会议等一些问题。
    由于苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁最近提出的关于在最近两三个月内举行最高级会议的建议已经赢得了全世界人民如此热烈的拥护，因此，麦克米伦在回答他对这个建议的看法的问题时，避免正面直接回答这个问题。但是，他在一开头时挑剔地说，布尔加宁建议所包括的参加会议的国家太多了，“这样，高峰就变成了高峰太多的山脉了。”他说，“有两种会议，一种有二十人到四十人参加的举行辩论的会议，另一种是一小群人的会议，这种会议可以作一些实际事情。”“当我们第一次谈到最高级会谈时，我心目中所想的是1955年日内瓦那样的会谈，即四个盟国或者再加上一两个国家”。
    麦克米伦接着强调在举行这种会议之前必须有所谓“充分的外交准备”。他说，在举行最高级会议之前，“至少应该举行外长会议来讨论议程”，“甚至在这以前还很可能要通过大使和外交途径来讨论议程。否则，你就会冒做一件其结果会导致失望的事情的危险”。
    当有人问到他是否认为苏联关于召开最高级会议的建议“只是一种宣传”时，麦克米伦说，“我不认为人们应该把这类事情看作是宣传”。
    谈到他在出国访问前夕在广播演说中提出的同苏联签定互不侵犯条约以作为一个总解决的起点的建议时，他说，他坚持这个建议，并没有撤回这个建议。但是他说，“我们需要用裁减所有的那些常规和非常规武器的行动作为一个开端。”他表示赞同发表一种关于互不进攻的正式宣言，“不论这种宣言采取什么形式”。
    麦克米伦大谈所谓“均势”理论，借以为西方的实力政策辩护。他说，在裁军进行的时候，应该保持这种均势，不要让某一方面的力量占优势。
    有记者问，英国政府为什么允许利用英国土地作为导弹基地。他说，从1947年以来，就有先是带原子弹后来是带氢弹的轰炸机驻在英国。他为自己辩护说，“导弹只是另一种形式的轰炸机”。
    他想对西伊里安问题表示一种不干预的态度。但是他说，“没有经过协商而采取的行动可能会给印度尼西亚造成损害和不良后果”。
    据新华社12日讯　英国首相麦克米伦今天结束了他到印度的访问，离开新德里到达卡拉奇。
    麦克米伦在四天访问期间曾经同印度总理尼赫鲁就国际事务和两国共同有关的问题交换了意见。他还同印度内阁的内政、国防、财政以及工商各部部长分别举行了会谈。
