Rural Sideline Production Cannot Be Relaxed

Since the beginning of winter, under the impetus of the socialist education movement, peasants across the country have launched a magnificent upsurge in agricultural production, centered on farmland water conservancy construction and manure accumulation, actively preparing for a bumper harvest this year. This is an extremely gratifying phenomenon. We hope that all regions will make further progress and, while grasping water conservancy construction and manure accumulation, also seize sideline production, treating sideline production as one of the main contents of the current upsurge in agricultural production.

Sideline production is an integral part of China's rural economy. Chinese farmers have always had the habit of engaging in sideline production. Farmers' income from sideline businesses generally accounts for about 30% of the total income from agriculture and sidelines. In some mountainous areas and areas with little land and a large population, the proportion is even higher. Agricultural cooperatives carrying out sideline production can not only increase income, which can be used to solve the shortage of funds for agricultural production and support agricultural production, but also use sideline income to make timely advances to members, meeting the needs of members' daily lives and boosting their enthusiasm for labor. There are many types of sideline products, and they are widely used. Many sideline products are necessities for the daily lives of the broad masses of people, and they are also raw materials for industrial and handicraft production; some are important export goods. Therefore, sideline production is also an indispensable sector of China's national economy. Everyone still remembers that after the spring plowing began in 1956, because some places relaxed sideline production before the spring plowing, the income of agricultural cooperatives decreased, production funds were lacking, members shouted that they had no pocket money, and the production of the cooperatives and the lives of the members encountered difficulties. We must remember this lesson.

This year, the tasks of farmland water conservancy construction and manure accumulation in various places are greater than in any previous year. In addition, it is also necessary to carry out party consolidation, commune consolidation and other rural work. The work tasks facing us are indeed quite heavy. However, as long as the work is arranged well and the labor force is organized and planned properly, sideline production can still be greatly developed. The example of Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, is a good illustration. Among the more than 800 agricultural cooperatives in Pingjiang County, more than 500 cooperatives once relaxed sideline production when the winter repair, winter planting and manure accumulation campaigns were launched at the beginning of winter. After the Pingjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed the reasons and studied countermeasures, it convened an enlarged cadre meeting in early November, emphasizing the importance of sideline production, requiring all townships and cooperatives to arrange the current rural work in a unified manner, make specific labor plans, combine sideline production with the upsurge in production, and ensure that each member household earns an average of fifteen yuan in sideline production in winter. After the four townships and sixty-one agricultural cooperatives under the Meixian District of the county made specific labor plans, they drew a total of more than 1,500 laborers to other places to cut timber and mine ore. By early December, they had earned more than 110,000 yuan in cash. The Hongyang Cooperative of the county specifically calculated the labor cost, labor force and time, and found that after deducting production and housework, there were more than 5,000 working days left. Therefore, it re-arranged more than 50 laborers to engage in seven sideline businesses such as brick and tile making, agricultural product processing and transportation, and drew 20 laborers to Jiangxi to cut timber, planning to earn more than 6,000 yuan in cash in winter. Now, the whole county has universally started sideline production, and has already earned more than 580,000 yuan in cash from sideline production; at the same time, it has also carried out the vigorous construction of water conservancy, manure accumulation and winter planting, and no work has been squeezed out. From this example, we can see that at the current critical juncture of very tight rural work, it is possible to carry out sideline production at the same time. The key lies in the leadership's attention and the proper arrangement of labor, so that agricultural and sideline production can be combined at the same time, and sideline production can support and promote agricultural production. Similar to the experience of Pingjiang County, in some counties, districts, and townships in Shandong Province, in order to ensure that the current agricultural and sideline production and rectification and commune consolidation work can be carried out well, in addition to the leadership's appropriate division of labor and control of these tasks, they also helped the cooperatives divide all the labor force into three shifts: one shift engaged in farmland capital construction (including well digging, canal excavation, reservoir and pond dam construction, soil improvement, terrace construction, ridge construction, afforestation, etc.), one shift engaged in winter agricultural production (including manure accumulation, wheat field management, digging, winter plowing), and one shift engaged in sideline production. After such an arrangement, the agricultural and sideline production and rectification and commune consolidation work in these places have all achieved great results. Like the experience of combined agricultural and sideline production in Hunan and Shandong, we believe that there must be many more in other regions, and we should pay attention to summarizing and vigorously promoting them.

In order to mobilize all positive factors to develop rural sideline production, agricultural cooperatives should adopt the methods of large-scale public management, small-scale public management and individual management according to the size of sideline production, the different requirements of various sidelines in terms of technology and equipment, and the management level of cadres. Over the past year, many cooperatives have implemented this method, decentralizing some sideline businesses with small production scales, low technical requirements, and suitable for decentralized management to production teams (groups) or individuals. This has played a certain role in promoting various sideline businesses and increasing the income of members. However, some cooperatives have decentralized sideline businesses that should be collectively managed, and have not effectively led the sideline business operations of teams, groups and individuals. This situation should be quickly changed. Developing the collective economy is the key to consolidating cooperatives. Developing the collective sidelines of cooperatives is of great benefit to the unified fundraising and use of funds, the unified allocation of labor, the balancing of members' income, the increase of public accumulation in cooperatives, and the promotion of the organic combination of agricultural and sideline production. To develop the collective sidelines of cooperatives, the primary task at present is to strengthen the management of these sideline productions, earnestly implement the principle of "payment according to work, more work more pay," and adopt a variety of payment methods that are conducive to production and can encourage members' production enthusiasm, based on the specific circumstances of various sideline productions, and implement a reasonable reward system. The labor remuneration of certain personnel with special skills (such as gardening, fish farming, sericulture, handicrafts, transportation, and lumberjacks) should also be appropriately taken care of with reference to social and historical habits.

Sideline production is commodity production. Party and government leading organs at all levels should organize the relevant departments such as agriculture, forestry, commerce, supply and marketing cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives and rural finance to jointly study and strengthen the specific leadership of sideline production in all aspects, solve the specific problems existing in local sideline production at present, and put forward the specific requirements that local sideline production should achieve, and push sideline production to a climax.

    农村副业生产不能放松
    入冬以来，全国各地农民在社会主义教育运动的推动下，掀起了波澜壮阔的以兴修农田水利和积肥工作为中心的农业生产高潮，积极地为今年的农业大丰收做准备，这是一个极为可喜的现象。我们希望各地百尺竿头更进一步，在兴修水利和积肥的同时，抓紧副业生产，把副业生产也当做当前农业生产高潮的主要内容之一。
    副业生产是我国农村经济的不可分割的部分，我国农民历来就有经营副业生产的习惯，农民经营副业的收入，一般占农副业总收入的30％左右，某些山区和地少人多的地区，占的比例还要大些。农业社开展副业生产，不仅可以增加收入，用以解决农业生产所缺少的资金，支援农业生产；而且可以用副业收入适时地预支给社员，解决社员日常生活的需要，鼓舞社员的劳动积极性。副业产品种类很多，用途很广。许多副业产品是广大人民日常生活所必需的，也是工业、手工业生产的原料；有些则是重要的出口物资。所以副业生产也是我国国民经济中不可缺少的部门。大家都还记得：在1956年春耕开始以后，曾经因为春耕前有些地方放松了副业生产，农业合作社收入减少，缺少生产资金，社员叫喊没有零花钱，社的生产和社员的生活都遇到困难。我们一定要记住这个教训。
    今年各地兴修农田水利和积肥的任务，比以往任何一年的都要大，再加上还需要进行整党、整社和其他农村工作，摆在我们面前的工作任务的确是相当繁重的。但是，只要工作安排得好，劳动力组织规划得当，副业生产仍然可以得到大的发展。湖南省平江县的例子就是很好的说明。平江县的八百多个农业社中，在冬初开展冬修、冬种和积肥运动时，有五百多个社曾经一度放松了副业生产。经过中共平江县委分析原因，研究了对策以后，在11月上旬召开了扩大干部会议，着重强调了副业生产的重要，要求各乡、社把当前的各项农村工作统一安排，作出具体的劳动规划，结合生产高潮开展副业生产，做到每户社员在冬季副业生产中平均收入十五元。该县梅仙片所辖的四个乡六十一个农业社进行了具体的劳力规划后，一共抽出一千五百多名劳动力到外地伐木和开采矿石，到12月上旬，已挣回了现金十一万多元。该县的虹阳社具体算了工夫账、劳力账和时间账，发现除掉生产、家务工以外，还剩有劳动日五千多个，便又重新安排五十多个劳动力从事砖瓦、农产品加工和运输等七项副业，并抽二十个劳力去江西伐木，计划在冬季收入现金六千多元。现在全县已普遍把副业生产搞起来了，并已从副业生产中收入了五十八万多元的现金；同时还进行了热火朝天的兴修水利、积肥和冬种工作，那一项工作也没有挤掉。从这个事例中，我们可以看到：在当前农村工作十分紧张的关头，是可以把副业生产同时搞起来的。关键在于领导重视，安排好劳力，这样就可以使农副业生产同时结合进行，而且还能以副业生产来支援和推动农业生产。和平江县的经验相类似，在山东省的一些县、区、乡，他们为了使当前农副业生产和整风、整社等工作都能很好地开展起来，除了领导上对这些工作适当分工掌握外，还帮助合作社将全部劳动力分为三班：一班搞农田基本建设（包括打井、开渠、修水库塘坝、改良土壤、筑台田、修畦田、造林等），一班搞冬季农业生产（包括积肥、麦田管理、刨地、冬耕），一班搞副业生产，经过这样一番安排以后，这些地方的农副业生产和整风、整社工作都同样获得了很大的成绩。像湖南、山东这样的农副业结合进行的经验，我们相信其他各地一定还有很多，应该注意总结，认真推广。
    为了调度一切积极因素来发展农村副业生产，农业社应该根据副业生产规模的大小，各种副业在技术、设备方面的不同要求，以及干部的管理水平，分别采取大公经营、小公经营和个人经营的办法。一年以来，许多合作社贯彻执行了这个办法，把一些生产规模小，技术要求不高，而又适于分散经营的副业，下放给生产队（组）或个人经营，这对促进各种副业生产，增加社员收入等方面都起了一定的作用。但是也有些社把应该集体经营的副业分散经营，对队、组和个人的副业经营领导不力，这种情况应该很快转变过来。发展集体经济是巩固合作社的关键。发展合作社的集体副业，对于统一筹集和使用资金，统一调配劳力，平衡社员收入，增加合作社公共积累，以及促进农副业生产的有机结合，都有很大的好处。要发展合作社的集体副业，当前的首要工作就是加强这些副业生产的管理，认真贯彻“按劳取酬，多劳多得”的原则，根据各种不同副业生产的具体情况，采取既有利于生产，又能鼓励社员生产积极性的多种多样的计酬办法，实行合理的奖励制度。对于某些具有特殊技术的人员（如园艺、养鱼、养蚕桑、手工业、运输、伐木工人等）的劳动报酬，还应该参照社会历史习惯，酌予照顾。
    副业生产是商品性的生产。各级党政领导机关应该很好地组织农业、林业、商业、供销合作、手工业合作和农村金融等有关部门，共同研究，从各个方面加强对副业生产的具体领导，解决当地当前副业生产中所存在着的具体问题，并且提出当地副业生产所应该达到的具体要求，把副业生产也推向高潮。
