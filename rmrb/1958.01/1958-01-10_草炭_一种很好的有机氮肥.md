    Peat - A Good Organic Nitrogen Fertilizer

    Peat, also known as turf, is called "mud coal" in some places, and "grass raft" in Northeast China. It is formed from the remains of ancient lake and swamp plants, buried underground through geological changes, and not fully decomposed under conditions of moist soil and poor ventilation. When wet, it is generally dark brown, and when air-dried, it becomes black or brownish-yellow. It is light in weight and loose in texture.

    Peat has a wide range of uses. It can be used as industrial fuel or for manufacturing coke. It can be used to extract combustible gases, alcohol, rosin, phenols, and other substances. In agriculture, it is a very valuable organic fertilizer. In Soviet state farms and collective farms, peat is widely used as fertilizer and has achieved significant yield increases.

    China has abundant peat reserves. In recent years, various regions across the country have successively discovered peat deposits, and many regions have conducted exploration, mining, and utilization. According to preliminary surveys, the area of peat swamps in Jilin Province alone is over 100,000 hectares. According to incomplete estimates, the reserves in 39 counties and cities in Zhejiang Province can reach more than 60 million tons.

    Based on the analysis of peat components from various parts of the country, the organic matter content is generally around 50%, making it a good organic nitrogen fertilizer. In 1956, a trial conducted by the First Farm of Liuhe County, Jilin Province, showed that land fertilized with 10 tons of peat produced 19% more than land fertilized with 10 tons of poor-quality soil manure. Land fertilized with the same amount of peat compost or peat-human manure mixture produced 47.7%-64.7% more than land fertilized with soil manure. Zhejiang Province conducted fertilizer effect tests in paddy fields: under the same fertilization conditions, land with an additional 1000 jin of peat yielded 6.9% more.

    Peat has a high capacity for absorbing liquids and gases. Using peat as bedding in livestock pens can produce high-quality peat compost, reducing the loss of fertilizer components in livestock manure and urine. Piling peat in toilets and cesspools, or mixing it with human manure and urine to make peat-human manure mixed fertilizer, can also preserve the nitrogen in human manure and urine. This is a good way to maintain fertilizer effectiveness.

    Peat is generally buried in low-lying, perennially waterlogged areas; much of it is buried under paddy fields. When digging, it is important to consider the land use after excavation and avoid indiscriminate digging. Attention should be paid to returning the soil to the fields after excavation. When filling the soil, the topsoil should be placed on top; otherwise, turning up raw soil will be detrimental to rice growth. As for the digging time, winter is more suitable. (Zhang Siming)

    草炭——一种很好的有机氮肥
    草炭又叫泥炭，有的地方叫泥煤，东北叫它草筏子。它是古代湖泊沼泽地带的植物遗体，经地质变迁，埋藏地下，在土壤潮湿、通气困难的情况下，不能充分分解而形成的。湿润时一般为黑褐色，风干后就变成黑色或黄褐色。体轻质地疏松。
    草炭的用途很广，可以用作工业燃料或制造焦炭，可以提取可燃性气体、酒精、松脂、酚及其他物质。在农业上是一种很宝贵的有机肥料。在苏联国营农场和集体农庄都已大量利用草炭作肥料，并已取得显著的增产效果。
    我国草炭蕴藏量丰富，几年来全国各个地区都相继发现，并且已有很多地区进行了勘查、开采和利用。据初步调查仅吉林一省泥炭沼泽的面积就在十万公顷以上。据不完全估计，浙江三十九个县市埋藏量可达六千多万吨。
    根据目前全国各地已经分析的草炭成分看来，有机质含量一般在50％左右，是一种很好的有机氮肥。1956年吉林柳河县第一农场的试验：施用十吨草炭肥料的地比施十吨质量不好的土粪增产19％；而施用同量的草炭厩肥或草炭人粪尿混合肥料的地，比施土粪要增产47.7％—64.7％。浙江省曾在水稻田进行过肥效试验：在同样施肥条件下，增施草炭一千斤的地增产6.9％。
    草炭具有高度的吸收液体和气体的能力。用草炭垫牲畜圈，能得到质量较高的草炭厩肥，减少牲畜粪尿中肥分的损失。在厕所和粪坑内垫草炭或和人粪尿混合堆积，制成草炭人粪尿混合肥料，也同样的能保存人粪尿中的氮素。这是保持肥效的好办法。
    草炭一般埋藏在地势低洼，常年积水的地方；很多的是埋藏在水田底下。挖掘时要考虑挖后的土地利用问题，不要乱挖乱采，应注意挖后归土还田。填土时应将表土填在上面，否则，翻上生土不利水稻生长。至于挖掘时间，以冬季较为比较合适。　（张肆明）
