    Hebei Provincial People's Committee Holds Meeting
    to Further Criticize Rightist Wang Baozhen
    (Our Dispatch) The Hebei Provincial People's Committee convened a meeting on January 3rd to further expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of bourgeois rightist Wang Baozhen.
    Wang Baozhen was a representative to the Hebei Provincial People's Congress, a member of the Provincial People's Committee, and Vice-Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. On the water conservancy issue, Wang Baozhen distorted the facts, reversed black and white, and negated achievements, launching vicious attacks and slanders. His reactionary words and deeds were thoroughly exposed and criticized during the Sixth Session of the First Hebei Provincial People's Congress in August 1957. All representatives unanimously agreed that Wang Baozhen's crimes of opposing the Party and socialism were serious, and proposed that the Provincial People's Committee continue to investigate Wang Baozhen's crimes. The results of investigations and understandings conducted by the Provincial People's Committee from relevant departments proved that Wang Baozhen not only launched vicious attacks against the Party and the government on the water conservancy issue, but also launched a series of vicious attacks against the Party and the government in areas such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, and the legal system. In particular, he repeatedly supported the reactionary remarks of rightist Huang Shaohong attacking the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the elimination of counter-revolutionaries. To this day, Wang Baozhen not only shows no signs of remorse or confession, but his attitude has become even worse, resorting to all kinds of denials.
    The participating committee members expressed great indignation at Wang Baozhen's serious crimes against the Party and socialism and his vile attitude. During the discussion, they unanimously agreed that Wang Baozhen was indeed a bourgeois rightist. This meeting further exposed and criticized Wang Baozhen's crimes, marking a major victory in Hebei Province's anti-rightist struggle.

    河北省人民委员会举行会议
    进一步批判右派分子王葆真
    本报讯　河北省人民委员会1月3日召开会议，进一步揭发和批判资产阶级右派分子王葆真的反动言行。
    王葆真是河北省人民代表大会代表，省人民委员会委员，政协河北省委员会副主席。王葆真在水利问题上歪曲事实，颠倒黑白，否定成绩，进行了恶毒的攻击和污蔑。对他的这种反动言行，在1957年8月间河北省第一届人民代表大会第六次会议上，曾进行彻底揭发和批判。全体代表一致认为王葆真反党、反社会主义的罪行严重，并提出交由省人民委员会继续对王葆真的罪行进行检查。经省人民委员会从有关方面进行调查了解的结果证明，王葆真不仅在水利问题上向党和政府进行了恶毒的攻击，并在镇反、肃反和法制等方面，向党和政府也进行了一系列的恶毒攻击，特别是一再支持右派分子黄绍竑攻击镇反、肃反的反动言论。至今，王葆真不但没有丝毫的悔悟和认罪的表现，态度反而更加恶劣，百般进行抵赖。
    与会委员对于王葆真这些严重的反党、反社会主义的罪行和恶劣态度，表示极大愤慨。在讨论中一致认为王葆真确是一个资产阶级右派分子。这次会议进一步揭发和批判了王葆真的罪行，是河北省反右派斗争的一个重大胜利。
