    In the Former Swampland
    Fan Chengzhuo
  If you open an old map of Albania, you can see a blue spot in the southeastern part of this "Land of Eagles": that is the Maliqi Swamp. For generations, it was a rusty dead water and endless mud, home to mosquitoes, water birds, and frogs, and the source of malaria. The area was remote and sparsely populated, with only occasional footprints of fishermen and hunters. It is said that when a girl got married, she would first inquire whether she would be marrying into the swamp area, because that was a road to poverty, illness, or even death.
    The suffering Albanian people had beautiful dreams for a happy life. They had offered good advice to the "Zog Dynasty": requesting that they find a way to drain this swamp area of 5,000 hectares. The feudal rulers at the time not only ignored this request but also created a terrifying myth, spreading rumors that there was a divine ox in the swamp, and anyone who tried to touch even a single blade of grass in the swamp would lose their life.
    This was before the liberation of Albania. The years passed quietly.
    But once the people have control of their own destiny, they will show the power to move mountains and seas, turning this sleeping, useless swamp into fertile farmland full of crops.
    Of course, this was not an easy task, but the heroic Albanian people conquered nature like fighting an enemy, and once they made up their minds, nothing could stop them. They finally completed the first "draining the swamp" project after liberation in the two-year economic recovery plan of 1949-1950, laying a solid foundation for other projects in Albania to drain swamps and improve the soil.
    One day, as we were traveling by car from Korçë to visit Maliqi, we were struck by a moving scene of scenery and people. A curved hill was split in half, and a flat, shiny asphalt road led from the Korçë plain to the former swamp. What a bustling former swamp it was! The clanging of machines from the factory, the "dada" sounds of tractors in the fields, and the sound of car horns on the road could be heard constantly.
    Adjacent to the foot of the mountain, a towering chimney rose above a row of poplar trees, with black smoke and milky white steam curling gently above the treetops. The large silhouette of the Maliqi Sugar Factory was revealed as our car moved closer. This is the first modern sugar factory built by the Albanian people with the help of the Soviet Union between 1949 and 1951. It is named after the birthday of the Albanian Labor Party, "November 8th," and churns out dozens of tons of sugar from the sugar machines every day. The factory's output has increased year by year. In 1957, the workers produced 7,361 quintals of sugar in excess of the plan for the people. We saw trucks loaded with bags of sugar, heading in all directions.
    Outside the factory, rows of workers' residences, neat and generous, have been built on both sides of the road. There is also a workers' club and cinema with 400 seats, a seven-year primary school with hundreds of children, as well as nurseries, shops, canteens... The roadsides and riverbanks are being greened.
    Facing the sugar factory and residences is a vast plain, extending to the foot of the distant mountains, a total of 5,000 hectares. This is one of the main sugar beet production areas in Albania, providing a steady supply of raw materials for the sugar factory.
    Our car drove straight to the "center of the swamp." After about five kilometers, we entered the Maliqi State Farm. There was no waterweed here, only thousands of lush weeping willows and poplars, sheltering red houses, workshops, warehouses... Cars, carts, and tractor-trailed wooden carts were transporting the huge sugar beets just dug out of the ground, one after another, in an endless stream. The farm's square was piled with several "sugar beet mountains."
    In 1957, the Maliqi State Farm had a bumper harvest of sugar beets, producing 500 quintals per hectare, selling 70,000 quintals more to the sugar factory than originally planned, strongly supporting the sugar factory and enabling it to further expand its production capacity.
    In response to the Party's call to take the road of collectivization, by mid-November 1957, all the villages in the Maliqi area had established cooperatives, which was a great joy. With the support of the government and taking the state farm as an example, cooperative members also achieved a bumper harvest. An old man held up a watermelon-sized sugar beet and showed it to us: "This is the result of our collectivization."
    In this former swamp, people, machines, and livestock were all busy for the harvest, and even we visitors shared their joy of harvest. After the harvest, the cooperative members will use this new income to build new houses, to jointly run primary schools and nurseries, and to add new clothes and furniture.
    I wondered: Why do the accents of the agricultural workers and many farmers on these farms differ from each other? Later I learned that their origins were not local to Maliqi.
    This plain is new, and the owners of this plain are mostly new as well. They grew up in the mountainous areas of southern Albania, where there is very little arable land, and many people live by grazing. Before liberation, they did not have enough to eat or wear, forcing some people to wander and drift, and almost every family had their own relatives or relatives who went to the United States, Argentina, Egypt, France, and other places to make a living. When the Maliqi Swamp became a plain, many people abandoned their poor mountainous areas and came down from the mountains to live a working life on the plain. There were as many as 300 households that came to the state farm alone.
    "We never dreamed that we would move from the mountains to the 'swamp' to settle down," a middle-aged farm worker, Skandar, told us with a smile. "My brother wandered abroad twenty years ago and will be coming back soon." Another female worker interjected, "This time, he won't be able to find the door to his home."
    Yes, everything has changed. The newly published map of Albania no longer marks the blue spots in the original swamp area, but a small circle, next to which is drawn a model of a sugar factory and a sugar beet. This is a miracle brought about by the socialist system and an example of Soviet assistance to Albania.
    I jokingly asked a young tractor driver next to me, "Where did the divine ox in the legend that the swamp was going to kill people go?" The young man humorously patted the steering wheel of his tractor and said, "Lo, this is it, now I'm riding on it." (The picture above is a scene of Maliqi today)
    Note: The word "Albania" means "eagle," and the Albanian national emblem also features an eagle as a symbol, so Albanians call their country the "Land of Eagles."

    在昔日的沼地里
    范承祚
  打开阿尔巴尼亚的旧地图就可看到：在这个“鹰之国”?的东南部，有一块蓝色的斑点，那就是马利基沼地。世世代代以来，这里是一片发锈的死水和无尽的泥泞，是蚊虫、水鸟和青蛙的家乡，是疟疾的发源地。这里地处偏僻，人烟稀少，偶然只有捕鱼行猎人的足迹来到这里。据说，姑娘出嫁都要首先打听一下：是否会嫁到沼泽地区去，因为那里是穷路、病路甚至是死路。
    备受苦难的阿尔巴尼亚人民，对幸福生活有过美妙的憧憬，他们曾向“索古王朝”?献过良策：要求设法排干这块面积达五千公顷的沼地。当时的封建统治者，不但置之不理，而且还造出一个骇人的神话谣传，说什么沼地内有一条神牛，谁想试图触动一根沼地里的草芥，都会丧命。
    这是阿尔巴尼亚解放前的事。岁月就这样不声不响地过去了。
    可是一当人民掌握了自己的命运，就会显出移山倒海的力量，把这块沉睡的、有害无利的沼地，变成长满庄稼的沃地良田。
    这当然不是一件轻而易举的工程，但英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民征服自然就像打击敌人一样，决心下定，无坚不克。他们终于在1949年—1950年恢复经济的二年计划中胜利地完成了解放后第一项“排干沼地”的工程，为阿尔巴尼亚排干沼地、改良士壤的其他工程打下了坚实的基础。
    一天，当我们乘一辆汽车从科尔察出发，前往马利基参观的时候，映入眼帘的是一片动人的风光人物。一座弧形的矮山被劈成了两半，一条平坦的发亮的柏油路从科尔察平原通向昔日的沼地里，好一块喧闹的昔日沼地！这里不断传出工厂里机器的铿锵声，田野间拖拉机的哒哒声，公路上的汽车喇叭声。
    挨着山脚，一根耸立的烟囱高出一排白杨树顶，树梢上缭绕着黑烟和乳白的蒸气，轻舒漫卷。马利基糖厂的庞大身影在我们的汽车向前移近中显露出来。这就是1949年—1951年间，在苏联的帮助下，阿尔巴尼亚人民建造起来的第一座现代化制糖厂。它以阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的生日“11月8日”命名，每天从制糖机里吐出数十吨糖。这个厂的产量逐年增加，1957年工人们就为人民超过计划生产出七千三百六十一公担糖。我们看到一辆辆载重汽车，满载糖袋，运往四面八方。
    工厂外，在公路两旁兴建了一幢幢工人住宅，整齐而大方，这里还有一座可容四百个座位的工人俱乐部和电影院，一所可容几百个孩子念书的七年制小学，此外还有托儿所、商店、食堂……路旁和河滨正在绿化。
    面对着糖厂和住宅的是一片广阔的平原，一直延伸到远山之根，方圆共五千公顷。这里是阿尔巴尼亚主要的甜菜产区之一，为糖厂源源地供应着所需的原料。
    我们的汽车径向“沼地中心”开去，约五里路光景，我们进入了马利基国营农场。这里并没有往日的水草，有的只是千百株葱茂的垂柳和白杨，掩映着红色的住房、工场、仓库……。汽车、大车和拖拉机牵引的木板车把地里刚刨出的硕大甜萝卜运来，接二连三，络绎不绝。农场的广场上堆成了若干座“甜菜山”。
    1957年马利基国营农场的甜菜大丰收，每公顷生产达五百公担，要比原计划超额卖给糖厂七万公担，有力地支援了糖厂，使它能够更大地发挥生产能力。
    为了响应党的号召，走合作化道路，到1957年11月中旬为止，马利基地区的农村已经全部建立了合作社，这是一件大喜事。在政府的支持下，以国营农场为榜样，合作社社员们也同样获得了丰收。一位老爷爷双手抱起一个冬瓜似的甜萝卜给我们看：“这就是我们合作化的结果。”
    在这个昔日的沼地里，人、机器、牲口都在为丰收而忙，连我们这些参观者也都分享了他们的丰收快乐。收获后，社员们就要用这批新的收入去建筑新住宅，去合起来办小学、托儿所，去添制新衣和家具。
    我奇怪：这些农场的农业工人和不少农民的口音为什么彼此有距离呢？后来我才知道：他们的原籍不是马利基当地人。
    这块平原是新的，这平原上的主人也多是新的。他们生长在阿尔巴尼亚南部的山区里，那里仅有很少的耕地，很多人靠放牧生活。解放前，他们吃不饱、穿不暖，逼得一些人出外飘泊流浪，几乎每一家都有自己的亲人或亲戚到美国、阿根廷、埃及、法国等地去谋生。当马利基沼地变成了平原以后，不少人抛弃了穷乡僻壤，下得山来，来过平原的劳动生活，单是来到国营农场的就有三百户之多。
    “我们做梦也没有想到会从山上搬到‘沼地’里来安家落户。”一位中年农场工人斯坎达尔对我们边笑边说：“我的哥哥二十年前流浪到外国，不久就要回来。”另一个女工插嘴说：“这一来，他可摸不到家门了。”
    是的，一切都变了，阿尔巴尼亚新出版的地图在原来的沼泽地区不再标志着蓝色的斑点了，而是一个小圈圈，旁边绘有一个糖厂模型和一颗甜菜。这是社会主义制度带来的奇迹和苏联对阿尔巴尼亚帮助的例证之一。
    我取笑地问身旁的一个年轻的拖拉机手：“传说沼地里那条要丧人命的神牛到哪里去了？”这位青年幽默地用手拍拍他的拖拉机的驾驶盘说：“囉，这就是，现在我骑在它的身上了。”（上图是今日马利基的一景）
    注?“阿尔巴尼亚”这个字的意思就是“鹰”，加之阿尔巴尼亚的国徽也以鹰为标志，所以阿尔巴尼亚人自称自己的国家为“鹰之国”。
    ?1924年—1938年阿尔巴尼亚的封建国王。
