The news published in today's newspaper about the Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory's shoddy production of gas generators causing serious consequences is a warning bell for the leading personnel of many enterprises: they must pay attention to quality and fully implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results!

The Party Central Committee's requirements for production and construction are to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This is an inseparable and complete line, and a comprehensive goal for the staff of economic departments to strive for. Production and construction must strive to shorten the time as much as possible, maintain a relatively high speed, and strive to increase output according to needs and capabilities, while also striving to ensure the improvement of quality, the suitability of varieties to needs, and the saving of funds. These aspects are mutually restrictive and mutually promoting, and neglecting any one of them will cause mistakes. The situation of the Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory is an example.

The factory produced more than 1,900 gas generators and dual-fuel diesel-gas generators in one year. The output cannot be considered small, and the speed cannot be considered low. The leading personnel of the factory were once complacent about this. However, due to the extremely poor quality of the products, among the more than 1,600 units sold, more than 1,100 units have now been requested for return by relevant units. In this case, how can we talk about output and speed, and how can we talk about more and faster? The poor quality of the products has also caused great waste. The machines produced by all the factory's employees over a year using a large amount of state materials can actually be used very little; the total value of the gas generators is only more than 2.9 million yuan, but now the losses caused to the state by repair costs alone are more than 1 million yuan. Isn't this waste very distressing?

More seriously, poor quality will not only prevent the enterprise's own production from achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, but will also hinder relevant units from implementing the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The gas generators of the Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory have caused many agricultural cooperatives to waste a lot of manpower and materials, and have also delayed the farming season, affecting agricultural production; and even caused the government to suffer some political losses as a result.

At present, the revolutionary zeal of the broad masses of cadres and workers is rising day by day. This zeal should be used for both more and faster, and also for better and more economical. The correct direction for developing revolutionary zeal is to comprehensively implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    一声警钟
    万向辛
    今天本报发表的天津市内燃机械厂粗制滥造煤气机造成严重恶果的消息，对于许多企业的领导人员是一声警钟：必须注意质量，必须全面地执行多快好省的方针！
    党中央对生产建设的要求是又多又快又好又省。这是一个不可分割的完整的方针，是经济部门工作人员的全面的奋斗目标。生产建设既要尽量争取缩短时间，保持较高的速度，按照需要和可能力求增加产量，又要努力保证质量的提高、品种的适合需要以及资金的节约。这几方面是互相制约，互相推进的，忽视其中任何一方面都会造成错误。天津市内燃机械厂的情况就是一个例证。
    这个厂在一年的时间内生产了一千九百多台煤气机和柴油煤气两用机，产量不能算少，速度不能算低，这个厂的领导人员也曾为此沾沾自喜。可是，由于产品质量十分低劣，在卖出去的一千六百多台当中，现在经有关单位提出要求退货的就有一千一百多台。这样一来，怎么谈得上产量、速度，怎么谈得上多和快呢？产品质量低劣也造成了极大的浪费。全厂职工花了一年时间用了国家大批材料生产出来的机器，实际能使用的却寥寥无几；全部煤气机价值不过二百九十多万元，现在仅修理费等为国家造成的损失就有一百多万元。这个浪费不是十分令人痛心吗？
    更严重的是，低劣的质量不仅会使本企业的生产不能多快好省，还会妨碍有关单位贯彻多快好省的方针。天津市内燃机械厂的煤气机，就使不少农业社浪费了大量人力、物力，而且耽误了农时，影响了农业生产；甚至还使政府因此受到了一些政治上的损失。
    现在，广大干部和职工的革命干劲正日益高涨。这种干劲既要用于多快，又要用于好省。发挥革命干劲的正确方向，就是全面地贯彻多快好省的方针。
