Xinhua News Agency, January 29th – The Fourth National Oil Industry Conference, which closed in Beijing today, decided that this year the oil industry should produce an additional 180,000 tons of oil beyond the state plan. This figure was proposed by the conference after exploring all possible ways to tap increased production potential in the face of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production; it is an 80% increase over the original 100,000-ton increase plan proposed by the Ministry of Food Industry. In addition, the conference decided to produce 740,000 tons of mixed feed this year. This mixed feed can raise more than 2.4 million pigs, each yielding 100 jin of meat.

This conference fully implemented the spirit of industry supporting agricultural and sideline production, and developing the oil industry on the basis of the development of agricultural and sideline production. In order to achieve the oil production increase plan, the conference put forward the following suggestions:

	1. Face the countryside, face the mountainous areas, and serve the rural economy. About 1.6 million tons of soybean for feed remain in the countryside every year, and about 190,000 tons of soybean are supplied to cities nationwide for feed every year. Last year, only 200,000 tons of soybean for feed were pressed in various places, and the vast majority have not yet been utilized. Pressing oil from soybean for feed can increase farmers' income without affecting the quality of the feed. The conference pointed out that factories must strictly prevent the tendency to only care about oil production and not the quality of soybean cake when producing soybean cake for feed. There are many self-used oilseeds remaining in the countryside, but some areas do not have native presses. Oil factories in these areas should actively process oilseeds for farmers.

	2. Vigorously open up various new oil sources and actively promote rice bran oil extraction. About 1.6 million tons of rice bran are concentrated in cities nationwide, but only about 100,000 tons were pressed last year. Experiments in Sichuan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi and other places have proved that rice bran cake is no worse than rice bran for feeding pigs. Pigs raised with rice bran cake by the Binjiang Agricultural Cooperative in Suining County, Sichuan, gain 1.5 jin per day, while pigs raised with rice bran only gain 1 jin per day. The conference called on all regions to rapidly develop rice bran oil extraction, especially in the southern regions that are rich in rice. Experiences in using corn germ and silkworm pupae to extract oil should be actively promoted. The conference also advocated using hot-pressed soybean cake, peanut cake, and sunflower cake to make soy sauce to save soybeans. Acorns and saltwort used to make wine in some places should be pressed for oil before being used to make wine.

The conference placed great hope on the full utilization of wild plant oilseeds. To date, 260 kinds of wild plant oilseeds have been discovered in various places, of which about 150 kinds have been proven by chemical analysis to be used for oil extraction. For example, cocklebur, saltwort, prickly ash seeds, and papaya seeds have relatively high oil content and relatively large yields. In the past two years, 10,000 tons of oil have already been extracted from them. The conference hopes to purchase at least 250,000 tons of wild oilseeds this year and extract 30,000 tons of oil.

	3. Actively assist agricultural departments in increasing the yield per unit area of ​​oil crops, and use all wasteland and idle land to plant sunflowers and hemp to strive for a great leap forward in oil production. The conference suggested that industrial departments in provinces and cities with the conditions should quickly establish oil crop experimental farms, special districts can establish oil crop experimental stations, counties can establish experimental fields, agricultural cooperatives can establish oil crop experimental groups, and oil factories in various places can also consider establishing oil crop experimental fields to actively carry out oil crop breeding and experimental research. In 1956, the average yield of peanuts per mu in my country was only 179.4 jin, while more than 40,000 mu of peanuts in Hong'an County, Hubei, produced an average of 534 jin per mu, and the highest yield was more than 1,000 jin. The conference pointed out that sunflowers are a high-yield oil crop with great development prospects, with a yield of more than 200 jin per mu. They are also resistant to salt, alkali, drought, and waterlogging, and can be planted in large quantities in low-lying and saline-alkali areas. Large-scale planting of sunflowers can not only increase oil, but also increase feed and fertilizer. The potential for developing oil tea, walnuts, and castor in mountainous areas, and flax in North China and Northwest China is also huge. The conference also suggested that industrial departments in various places actively assist forestry departments in inspecting the restoration and development of oil tea forests.

Last year, various localities made some achievements in the production of mixed feed, which promoted the development of pig raising. Seventy-eight oil factories in Jiangsu Province used factory by-products such as cottonseed hulls, peanut hulls, crude lecithin, and agricultural and sideline products such as bean pods and corn cobs to produce mixed feed. In just nine months, they produced 25,000 tons, which is equivalent to one month's feed for 170,000 fat pigs. The conference pointed out that various regions should vigorously promote this experience of Jiangsu Province, actively organize oil factories to select raw materials locally to produce mixed feed; especially small oil factories close to the countryside should universally carry out this work to combine oil, feed, and fertilizer.

In addition, the conference decided to adopt the policy of fully utilizing native presses. Native presses scattered in the countryside should be managed by agricultural cooperatives as much as possible, and the state can implement the method of collecting more oil and less material. This can promote the development of rural sideline industries, increase farmers' income, and invigorate the rural economy, thereby encouraging farmers' enthusiasm for planting oilseeds, and can also eliminate unnecessary transportation of oil and cake.

Industrial departments should strengthen technical guidance to agricultural cooperative oil workshops, help them improve technology, implement the combination of factories and workshops, use factories to drive workshops, and combine industry and agricultural sideline industries to promote agricultural sideline industries, thereby taking the existing native press management a step forward. The conference pointed out that the construction of small and medium-sized factories should be the main focus in the future, especially the construction of more small oil factories. These small oil factories have more difficulties in setting up factories and management alone, and can be considered to be combined with small enterprises such as winemaking, rice milling, flour milling, dairy products, and sugar making according to different conditions in various places to implement diversified operations. This not only has a short construction time, small investment, and quick results, but also can fully utilize scattered resources and rural labor to serve the rural economy.

    全国油脂会议确定生产方针
    争取油料饲料肥料全面增产
    会议提出跃进指标决定今年增产油脂十八万吨
    据新华社29日讯　今天在北京闭幕的全国第四次油脂工业会议决定：今年油脂工业要在国家计划之外多生产油脂十八万吨。这个数字是会议在工农业生产面临大跃进的情况下面经过千方百计地挖掘增产潜力之后提出来的；它比原来食品工业部提出的十万吨的增产计划，提高了80％。此外，会议还决定今年要生产七十四万吨混合饲料。这些混合饲料可以养每只出肉一百斤的猪二百四十多万头。
    这次会议充分贯彻了工业支援农副业生产，以及在农副业发展的基础上来发展油脂工业的精神。为了实现油脂增产计划，会议提出了几点建议：
    一、面向农村，面向山区，为农村经济服务。每年留在农村的饲料大豆约有一百六十万吨，全国城市供作饲料的大豆，每年也在十九万吨左右。去年各地只榨了二十万吨饲料大豆，极大部分还没有利用。用饲料大豆榨油，可以增加农民收入，也不影响饲料的质量。会议指出，凡作饲料的豆饼，工厂一定要严格防止只顾出油不顾豆饼质量的倾向。留在农村的自用油料很多，而有些地区又没有土榨。在这些地区榨油厂应积极代农民加工。
    二、大力开辟各种新油源，积极推广米糠榨油。全国集中在城市的米糠约有一百六十万吨，去年只榨了约十万吨。四川、江苏、江西等地试验证明，糠饼喂猪并不比米糠差。四川遂宁县滨江农业社用糠饼养的猪，每天长一斤五两，用米糠养的猪每天只长一斤。会议要求各地把米糠榨油工作迅速开展起来，特别是南方盛产大米的地区。利用玉米胚芽、蚕蛹等榨油的经验都应该积极推广。会议还提倡用热榨豆饼、花生饼、向日葵饼等来做酱油，以节约大豆。有些地方用来做酒的橡子、盐蒿子等应先榨油后做酒。
    会议对于充分利用野生植物油料寄予很大的希望。到目前为止，各地发现的野生植物油料已达二百六十种，其中经过化验证明可以用来榨油的约有一百五十种。如苍耳子、盐蒿子、花椒子、木瓜子等含油比较多，产量也比较大，前两年已经用来榨了一万吨油。会议希望今年至少收购二十五万吨野生油料，榨油三万吨。
    三、积极协助农业部门提高油料作物单位面积产量，并利用一切荒地闲地种植向日葵和麻，争取油料产量的大跃进。会议建议有条件的省市工业部门迅速建立油料试验场，专区可以建立油料试验站，县可以建立试验田，农业社可以建立油料试验组，各地油厂也可以考虑附设油料试验田，积极进行油料选种和试验研究工作。我国1956年花生平均每亩产量只有一百七十九点四市斤，而湖北红安县四万多亩花生平均每亩就产到五百三十四市斤，最高的产到一千市斤以上。会议指出，向日葵是一种很有发展前途的高产油料作物，亩产量可达二百斤以上，又耐盐、碱，又能抗旱抗涝，在低洼地区和盐碱地区可以大量种植。大量种植向日葵，不仅可以增加油料，还可以增加饲料和肥料。其他如山区发展油茶、核桃、蓖麻，华北、西北发展胡麻的潜力都十分巨大。会议并建议各地工业部门积极协助林业部门对恢复和发展油茶林方面进行检查。
    去年各地在生产混合饲料方面作出了一些成绩，促进了养猪业的发展。江苏省有七十八个油厂利用工厂副产品如棉壳、花生壳、粗磷脂，以及农副产品如豆荚、玉米棒等生产混合饲料，只九个月就生产了二点五万吨，相当于十七万头肥猪一个月的饲料。会议指出，各地应该大力推广江苏省这一经验，积极组织油厂就地选择原料生产混合饲料；特别是接近农村的小型油厂，应该普遍开展这一工作，把油料、饲料、肥料三料结合起来。
    此外，会议决定对于土榨要采取充分利用的方针。分散在农村中的土榨应该尽量由农业合作社经营管理，国家可以实行多收油少收料的办法。这样可以促进农村副业的发展，增加农民收入，活跃农村经济，从而鼓励农民种植油料的积极性，还可以消除油、饼的不必要的运输。
    工业部门应该加强对农业社油坊的技术指导，帮助他们提高技术，实行厂坊结合，以厂带坊，工业和农副业相结合，工业带动农副业的作法，从而把现有土榨管理向前推进一步。会议指出今后应该以建设中小型厂为主，尤其应该多办小型油厂。这些小型油厂单独设厂和管理困难较多，可以考虑根据各地不同情况分别同制酒、碾米、磨粉、乳品、制糖等小型企业相结合，实行多种经营。这样作不仅建设时间短、投资小、收效快，而且可以充分利用分散的资源和农村劳动力，为农村经济服务。
