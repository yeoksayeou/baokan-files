    This is a special dispatch from the New China News Agency: Xining City’s winter patriotic health campaign is developing vigorously, and a high tide will be launched throughout the city during the New Year's Day and Spring Festival periods. In recent days, in the streets and alleys of Xining City, in the offices, dormitories, and courtyards of government agencies, and in residential houses, people can be seen everywhere sweeping the streets and removing garbage.
    Middle and primary school students in Xining City, who are on winter vacation, have formed "cleaning commando teams" under the command of street offices in the urban area, and the commando members set out with brooms early every morning. Government cadres and citizens have carried out large-scale indoor and outdoor clean-ups and catching sparrows and rats. Ye Xipeng, the mayor of Xining City, led the heads of bureaus and offices of the Xining Municipal People's Committee and all cadres to catch sparrows. Thousands of tons of garbage left over for several years opposite the Qinghai Provincial Public Security Department have been cleared. More than 70% of citizens have washed their bedding. Through the winter patriotic health campaign, many government agencies have established a system of cleaning and eliminating pests.

    西宁城卫生景象
    本报特约新华社专稿　西宁市的冬季爱国卫生运动正在蓬勃展开，在元旦和春节期间，全市将要掀起一个高潮。连日来，在西宁市的大街小巷，在机关的办公室、宿舍和院落以及在居民住宅里，几乎到处都可以看到清扫街道、清除垃圾的人们。
    正在度寒假的西宁市中、小学生，分别在市区街道办事处的指挥下，组成了“清扫突击队”，每天清晨，突击队员们就携带着扫帚分头出动。机关干部和市民都分别进行了室内外大扫除和捕捉麻雀、老鼠。西宁市市长叶锡彭带领了西宁市人民委员会各局、处负责人和全体干部捕捉麻雀。青海省公安厅对面几年来遗留下的数千吨垃圾已被清除。70％以上的市民都已拆洗了被褥。通过冬季爱国卫生运动，不少机关已经把清洁卫生除四害订成制度。
