White House's Spring Greeting
Chi Bei'ou Poem, Jiang Yousheng Illustration

American citizens, you must make more sacrifices to strengthen our position of strength, for "deterrence," "retaliation," and "preemptive strikes." We have a military advantage, so our military budget must look like that of a military power; we have already lost our military advantage, so we must continue to increase military spending. Tighten your belts and open your wallets. Eat less butter, make more cannons; make more missiles, drink less milk. The Soviet Union advocates ending the Cold War, absolutely not! The Soviet Union suggests negotiations with us, don't listen to their nonsense! For the peace of the world, we must step up the pace of arms expansion; for the security of the United States, we have no choice but to head towards the cliff of destruction!

    白宫的迎春曲
    池北偶诗　江有生图美国的公民们，你们要作更多的牺牲，为了加强我们的实力地位，为了“威慑”、“报复”和“先发制人”。我们有着军事优势，所以我们的军事预算得像个军事强国的样子；我们已经失去军事优势，所以我们必须继续增加军事开支。勒紧你们的裤带，打开你们的钱袋。少吃点黄油，多造些大炮；多造些导弹，少喝点牛奶。苏联主张结束冷战，绝对不能干！苏联建议同我们会谈，别听它扯淡！为了世界的和平，我们一定要加紧备战的步伐；为了美国的安全，我们只好奔向毁灭的悬崖！
