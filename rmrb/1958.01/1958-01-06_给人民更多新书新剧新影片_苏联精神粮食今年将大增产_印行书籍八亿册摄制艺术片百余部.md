    (Our Correspondent in Moscow, 4th) This year, Soviet publishing houses will publish more new books, theaters will stage more new plays, and film studios will produce many new films to meet the growing cultural needs of the broad masses of the Soviet people.
    The fifth edition of "The Complete Works of Lenin," the new edition of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and textbooks on the foundations of Marxism-Leninism will be published successively this year by the State Publishing House for Political Literature. This publishing house will publish 476 new books this year, with a total distribution of over 113 million copies. The Soviet State Publishing House for Literary Works will publish 700 new books. The total number of books, magazines, and other publications printed throughout the Soviet Union this year will be approximately 800 million copies.
    Theaters across the country are staging new plays one after another. The Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow will stage Khachaturian's new ballet "Spartacus" and Tchaikovsky's new opera "The Sorceress". The Moscow Operetta Theatre will stage the lyrical ballet "The Legend of Ohrid" by Yugoslav composer Hristic. The Moscow Gorky Theatre will stage "Russian Forest," adapted from the novel by Leonov, which won the 1957 First Class Lenin Prize. The Kirov Theatre in Leningrad will stage the new ballet "Masquerade."
    Film studios across the Soviet Union will produce 118 feature films this year. Some of these films are based on the Great October Revolution and Lenin's revolutionary activities, such as the wide-screen films "From February to October" (Parts I and II), "The First in the World," and "To Ilyich." The audience will also be able to see three films, including "And Quiet Flows the Don."
