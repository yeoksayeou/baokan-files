Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th - According to the Vietnam News Agency, a possibly three or four hundred-year-old ancient wax mummy was recently unearthed in Thanh Hoa Province, more than 100 kilometers south of Hanoi. The corpse is dry and hard, with a fragrant aroma, and the limbs can be rotated at the joints.

The deceased appears to be a middle-aged noblewoman with long, black hair, wearing silk pants and six ancient noblewoman's robes. The clothing is not completely decayed. The coffin is made of fragrant wood produced in central Vietnam and painted with red lacquer. It is also wrapped in a cloth cover embroidered with silver thread. The outer coffin is made of pinkish-white speckled lime soil, which becomes harder when immersed in water.

Judging from the clothing and other circumstantial evidence, the deceased may have been the wife of a high-ranking official of the Later Le Dynasty in Annam in the 16th century.

    越南掘出一具古代尸腊
    据新华社河内16日电　据越南通讯社报道，最近河内以南一百多公里的清化省内发掘出一具可能是三、四百年前的古代尸腊。尸体干硬，异香扑鼻，四肢关节可以转动。
    死者似乎是一个中年贵妇人，头发又黑又长，身穿绸裤和六件古代贵妇的袍服。衣物没有全部腐烂。棺材是用越南中部盛产的香木制成的，上面涂有红漆。外面还包有银线刺绣的布套。棺槨是带白点的粉红色的石灰土，浸水时更为坚硬。
    从衣饰和其他旁证看来，死者可能是十六世纪安南黎朝一个大官的夫人。
