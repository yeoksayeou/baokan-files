Is Being Careless About the Quality of Water Conservancy Projects Acceptable?
Jinggang Cooperative Organizes On-Site Debate to Sharpen Eyes

(Our Dispatch) The Jinggang Agricultural Cooperative in Heping Township, Yongxing County, Hunan Province, organized its members to debate the issues of improving project quality and strengthening labor discipline at water conservancy construction sites, thereby enhancing labor efficiency and project quality.

During an inspection of last winter's water conservancy work, the cooperative committee discovered instances of carelessness and sloppiness. It was immediately decided to organize debates at each construction site on the following topics: How can we strive for a great leap forward in production in 1958? Is it acceptable for project quality to be mediocre? Is it acceptable to work in a lazy and sluggish manner? For example, during a debate held on December 11th at the Libeichong New Pond construction site of the Ninth Team, opinions were quite divided: some said there were too many projects to complete, so they had to be sped up; some said repairing water conservancy projects was not as good as engaging in sideline occupations, which yielded immediate cash; some said it was enough to repair their own team's pond, and they were too lazy to support other teams. Li Liangde, the head of the debate group, said, "Water conservancy is our foundation. How can we achieve an average yield of 900 catties of grain per mu in 1958?" The mention of 900 catties per mu invigorated everyone. Li Lianshun said, "Water conservancy is grain. Even if we build a little more, it will always be beneficial, and we must not be careless. It's a little tiring now, but wouldn't it be great to harvest more grain in 1958?" Li Liangde then brought up the example of the ponds repaired hastily and carelessly the year before, which resulted in losses last year. Everyone shoveled soil and rammed it while discussing the matter: The two ponds repaired by this team the year before were poorly constructed because many people were rushing for work points at the time, and they leaked when filled with water. They didn't play a role in drought resistance last year, resulting in reduced production. If they are repaired well this year, plus the construction of this new pond, we can ensure that we won't suffer from drought and reduced production, and we can also plant double-cropping rice, increasing production by tens of thousands of catties of grain!" At this time, three or four cooperative members criticized Wu Baoxiu for being late for work and not being careful when applying the soil. Finally, everyone unanimously established project quality standards and construction site discipline.

The situation at each construction site is now greatly different from before: previously, many cooperative members would not start work until 10:00 AM and would stop working as soon as the sun set; now, cooperative members are on the construction site early in the morning and don't return until long after the sun has set. Previously, they would ram the soil after filling it to a height of one foot, but now it is common to ram the soil after filling it to a height of three or five inches. The cooperative committee inspected the seventeen ponds completed in the first phase, and generally, they all met the project quality standards. Originally, they planned to only repair twenty mountain ponds, but now, because labor efficiency has improved, they have decided to expand the plan to forty-three ponds.

### 水利工程质量马虎点行不行？  井岗社组织工地辩论擦亮眼睛

    水利工程质量马虎点行不行？
    井岗社组织工地辩论擦亮眼睛
    本报讯　湖南永兴县和平乡井岗农业社，组织社员在水利工地上辩论提高工程质量、加强劳动纪律问题，提高了劳动效率和工程质量。
    社委会在检查去年冬修工作中，发现了马虎草率的现象，便决定立即在各工地辩论：怎样来争取1958年生产大跃进？工程质量马马虎虎行不行？出工懒懒散散要不要得？如12月11日在第九队犁背冲新塘工地辩论时，意见很不一致：有的说工程多了，完不成，只有加快；有的说修水利不如搞副业，得几个现钱；有的说，修好本队的塘就算了，懒得去支援别队。辩论组长李良德说：“水利是我们的根本，1958年平均每亩收九百斤谷，怎么办？”说起每亩收九百斤，大家的劲就来了。李连顺说：“水利就是谷，哪怕再多修一点，总有好处，就是马虎不得；现在累一点，1958年多收谷子还不好呀。”李良德接着提出前年修塘省事图快，结果去年吃了亏的事例。大家便一边挑土、打硪，一边你一言，我一语，算了这样一笔账：这个队前年修的两口塘，因为那时许多人抢工分，修得很不好，盛水就漏了，去年抗旱时没起到作用，减产了。今年要是修好了，加上开了这口新塘，保证不得受旱减产，还可以种上双季稻，增产万把斤谷是靠得住的！这时有三、四个社员，对吴保秀出工迟，上土不细心提出了批评。最后，大家还一致订出了工程质量标准和工地纪律。
    现在各个工地的情况，比以前大大不同了：原先许多社员要到上午10点钟才出工，下午太阳落山就收工；现在一清早社员都上了工地，太阳落山很久才回来。原来填了一尺高的土才打硪，现在普遍是填土三寸五寸打硪。社委会检查第一期完工的十七口塘，一般都合乎工程质量标准。原来打算只修整山塘二十口，现在因为劳动效率提高，决定扩大为四十三口。
