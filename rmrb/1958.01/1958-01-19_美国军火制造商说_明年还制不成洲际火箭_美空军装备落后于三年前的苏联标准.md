Xinhua News Agency, January 18th News: Washington - "New York Times" reporter Morris reported from Washington that the agent of "General Dynamics Corporation's" "Convair" plant, which manufactures the "Atlas" intercontinental ballistic missile, said to the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on the 16th that the Pentagon's assumption that the "Atlas" could be made by the end of 1959 was "too optimistic." Thomas Lanphier, the deputy manager of the "Convair" plant, said that the United States could only rely on conventional weapons for the next five years.  Lowe Hurley, the chairman and general manager of "Curtiss-Wright Corporation," which manufactures aircraft engines, also told the committee on the same day that the equipment currently purchased by the U.S. Air Force is lagging behind even when measured against Soviet standards of three years ago.

    美国军火制造商说
    明年还制不成洲际火箭
    美空军装备落后于三年前的苏联标准
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：“纽约时报”记者摩里斯自华盛顿报道，制造“阿特拉斯”洲际弹道火箭的“通用动力公司”“康瓦尔”工厂的代理人16日在参议院军备小组委员会上说，五角大楼关于“阿特拉斯”能够在1959年底制成的假定是“太乐观了”。“康瓦尔”工厂副经理托马斯·兰菲尔说，在最近五年内美国只能依靠通常的武器。制造飞机引擎的“蔲蒂斯—赖特公司”董事长兼总经理劳·赫尔利同一天也对这个委员会说，现在美国空军所购买的装备，就是以三年前的苏联标准来衡量也是落后的。
