Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 10th. The worker representatives of the state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory visited the rural areas of Jun County, Hubei Province, where mountains were being moved and rivers were being diverted to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production. They also studied the model deeds of the Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory, which was working hard and running its business frugally. This gave all the workers a profound socialist education. Now, a production upsurge is rapidly forming in this factory.

The leading cadres of the No. 1 Cotton Mill, with the attitude of "where there is advanced experience, we should go there to learn," organized a worker delegation at the end of last year, including young and old, male and female workers, technicians, and cadres. They visited the No. 1 and No. 4 Agricultural Cooperatives of the Mingxing Agricultural Cooperative and the Huohua Agricultural Cooperative in Jun County, and were warmly welcomed and cordially received by these agricultural cooperatives. The cadres and members of these cooperatives introduced the story of diverting water up the mountains and turning sandy beaches into fertile fields. In the past two years, the members of these cooperatives have been digging canals and opening up mountains with perseverance, which has greatly changed the face of this place, known as a poor mountain and bad water area, and the income of farmers has increased by one to several times. The workers were very moved and admired when they saw the leaping development of the new countryside after cooperation and the improvement of the lives of the members, as well as the drive of the farmer brothers to realize the great leap forward in agriculture and the infinite wisdom of transforming nature. At the Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory, the workers visited the nursery that cost three cents, the barbershop that cost three yuan, and the bathhouse that cost two yuan and five cents. They learned the frugal style from top to bottom of this factory and the sense of ownership of loving the factory as their home.

When visiting the agricultural cooperatives in Jun County, the workers went to the construction site where water conservancy projects were being built, took off their coats, and helped the farmer brothers dig ditches and carry soil. To commemorate this event, Zhang Renchang, director of the Mingxing No. 4 Cooperative, announced on the spot on behalf of all the members that "Dongzishan Canal" would be renamed "Worker-Peasant Alliance Canal". To commemorate the meeting with the worker elders, the society where Li Dagui, a model agricultural laborer in Hubei Province, was located—the Mingxing No. 1 Cooperative—also renamed the "Wolong Canal" that diverted water up the mountain to "Worker-Peasant Friendship Canal". The members of the three cooperatives also proposed this year's grain and cotton production increase to support the industrialization competition conditions, and launched a socialist friendship competition initiative to the workers of the No. 1 Cotton Mill. The representatives of the No. 1 Cotton Mill responded to the competition initiative on the spot on behalf of all the workers, and their conditions proposed that the quality of yarn should catch up with the national advanced level.

This visit broadened the horizons and opened up the minds of the workers who had lived in the factory for a long time. Before going down, the opinions among the workers on whether industry could make a leap forward were inconsistent, but after seeing the amazing progress and leaping development of the countryside under the leadership of the Party, many people felt that their drive was indeed behind the farmers, and affirmed that industrial production could also make a great leap forward.

This seven-day visit back and forth surpassed several years of ideological education work. After the visiting representatives returned to the factory, they conducted extensive dissemination to all the workers. At meetings, small meetings, canteens, and dormitories, they talked about revolutionary drive and hard work everywhere. Now, the doors of factories and office buildings are plastered with eye-catching slogans such as "A Great Leap Forward in Quality, Catching Up with National Advanced Factories"; "Running Enterprises Diligently and Frugally, Learning from Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory" and learning from Li Dagui, etc. Originally, the twenty-one yarn return rate required to be reduced to below 0.3%, and the workers had no confidence. On the day they heard the visiting representatives convey this, more than 20 people broke through this target; the next day, Zeng Hehua, a worker in the spinning workshop, created a new city record of 0.18%. In terms of saving and running enterprises diligently and frugally, all the workers in the factory have posted more than 300 big-character posters. From individuals to workshops, they have formulated savings plans. Many workers said they would not receive work clothes for ten or fifteen years; many workers who applied for housing took the initiative to withdraw their applications; the workers who were making trouble about wages and benefits felt very ashamed and gave up their unreasonable and excessive demands.

At present, all the workers are conducting in-depth discussions, conducting "three comparisons" - comparing revolutionary drive, the sense of ownership, and past and present life with agricultural members and Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory workers. Through the three comparisons, this year's production plan will be formulated. The preliminary discussion results of the workers show that this factory can save more than 200,000 yuan this year. The indicators that the leadership originally thought were advanced are being broken through one by one by the masses. All the workers are full of confidence and are leaping towards the national advanced level.

    向职工进行社会主义教育的好办法
    武汉国棉一厂组织职工代表访问农村
    全厂职工革命干劲十足迅速掀起生产高潮
    新华社武汉10日电　国营武汉第一棉纺织厂的职工代表，参观访问正在移山改河、实现农业生产大跃进的湖北省均县农村和艰苦奋斗、勤俭办企业的襄樊棉织厂的模范事迹后，使全体职工受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育。现在，一个生产高潮，正在这个厂里迅速形成。
    国棉一厂的领导干部抱着“那里有先进，就到那里学习”的态度，去年年底组织了一个包括青年、老年、男、女工人和技术人员、干部的职工代表团，在均县参观访问了明星农业社一社、明星农业社四社和火花农业社，受到了这些农业社的热烈欢迎和盛情接待。这些社的干部和社员向代表团介绍了引水上山和沙滩变良田的事迹。近二年来，这些社的社员们以坚韧不拔的精神辟山开渠，已使这个向称穷山恶水之地的面貌大为改观，农民收入增加了一倍至几倍。工人们看到合作化以后新农村的飞跃发展和社员生活的改善，以及农民兄弟为了实现农业大跃进的干劲和改造大自然的无穷智慧，非常感动和敬佩。在襄樊棉织厂，工人们参观了三角钱办的托儿所、三元钱办的理发室和两元五角钱办的浴室，学习了这个厂从上到下的那种勤俭风气和爱厂如家的主人翁思想。
    在均县参观农业社时，工人们走到正在兴修水利的工地，脱下外衣，帮助农民兄弟挖渠、挑土，为了纪念这件事，明星四社主任张仁长当场代表全体社员宣布“洞子埝渠”更名为“工农联盟渠”；为了纪念和工人老大哥的会见，湖北省农业劳动模范李大贵所在社——明星一社也把引水上山的“卧龙渠”更名为“工农友好渠”。三个社的社员还提出今年粮、棉增产，支援工业化的竞赛条件，向国棉一厂工人发起社会主义友谊竞赛的倡议；国棉一厂的代表当场代表全体工人响应这个竞赛倡议，他们的条件中提出纺纱质量赶上全国先进水平。
    这次参观，使得长期生活在工厂的职工扩大了眼界，开阔了思想。在下去以前，对于工业能不能跃进，职工之间的意见是不一致的，但是当看到农村在党的领导下这种惊人的进步和飞跃的发展以后，许多人感到自己的干劲确实落后于农民，肯定了工业生产也能来个大跃进。
    这一次来回只用了七天时间的参观访问，赛过几年的思想教育工作。参观代表回厂以后，向全厂职工进行了广泛传达，大会、小会、食堂、宿舍，到处谈革命干劲、讲艰苦奋斗。现在，厂房、办公大楼门口到处贴满了“质量大跃进，赶上全国先进厂”；“勤俭办企业，向襄樊棉织厂学习”以及向李大贵等学习的醒目标语。原来二十一支纱回花率要求降到0.3％以下，工人都没有信心，听了参观代表传达的当天，就有二十多人突破了这个指标；第二天，细纱车间工人曾荷花又创造了0.18％的全市新纪录。在节约和勤俭办企业方面，全厂职工已经贴出了三百多张大字报，从个人到车间都纷纷订出了节约规划，很多工人表示十年、十五年不领工作服；很多申请住房的职工主动撤回了申请书；原来闹工资待遇的职工都感到很惭愧，纷纷放弃了自己不合理和过高的要求。
    目前，全体职工正在深入地进行讨论，进行“三比”——和农业社员、襄樊棉织厂职工比革命干劲、比主人翁思想、比今昔生活。通过三比，制订今年的生产规划。职工们初步讨论的结果，今年这个厂可节约二十多万元，领导上原来认为先进的指标，正被群众一个一个的突破，全体职工正信心百倍地向全国先进水平跃进。
