Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 5th: Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, has achieved consecutive years of livestock success, setting the highest breeding record in general agricultural areas in China and providing valuable experience for developing livestock in these regions.

After collectivization in the second half of 1955, Weinan County produced 2,579 foals and calves in 1956. In 1957, this increased to 3,553, a 15.12% increase compared to 1956, a 31.42% increase compared to before collectivization, and more than 46% increase compared to before liberation. Currently, the county has about 3,000 pregnant mares and cows. It is estimated that after these animals give birth, the county will have a total of 54,000 large livestock such as cattle and donkeys, enabling many agricultural cooperatives to achieve "self-sufficiency."

After the National Animal Husbandry Conference, the Weinan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party formulated a plan for protecting and breeding livestock during the Second Five-Year Plan, based on local conditions. It guarantees fulfilling the targets set in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) five years ahead of schedule, ensuring that each agricultural cooperative has enough livestock for its use, and basically achieving "thriving mangers and year-round safety." According to the plan, the county will breed 71,924 large livestock in the next five years, a 40.26% increase compared to the county's existing large livestock. Starting this year, the county will increase by an average of 4,149 animals per year, with the net increase rate increasing from 6% to 7% in the first three years of the Second Five-Year Plan, and further increasing from 7.5% to over 8% in the last two years, catching up with the development targets for pastoral areas requested at the recent National Animal Husbandry Symposium. By the fifth year, excluding old, disabled, and young livestock, the county will have more than 60,000 healthy draft animals, reducing the area of cultivated land burdened by each draft animal from the current 33.7 mu to about 23 mu.

Weinan County belongs to a general agricultural area. Local leading bodies attach great importance to leading livestock breeding work, and various agricultural cooperatives have accumulated certain experience and foundation in breeding and raising livestock. In the past two years, the county's livestock has bred quickly. According to a survey of 93 agricultural cooperatives, the average annual net increase rate has reached 6.65%. Many agricultural cooperatives have achieved "mares and cows producing offspring every year, and every offspring surviving," and individual mothers have even produced two foals (calves) a year. The phenomena of epidemics, weakness, and abnormal deaths have also been greatly reduced or eliminated. Weinan County now has more than 50,000 large livestock, including more than 13,100 breeding females. It is estimated that in the first three years of the Second Five-Year Plan, the number of breeding females will increase by an average of 16,000 per year. Assuming that 50% of the livestock are bred each year, the above targets can be overfulfilled.

Weinan County has also formulated measures to ensure the completion of the above targets. It plans to continue mobilizing the masses to carry out crash breeding campaigns throughout the county, and universally organize livestock breeding households, veterinarians, and agricultural cooperatives to sign contracts with each party responsible for their respective duties, achieving "guaranteed breeding, guaranteed pregnancy, and guaranteed survival." At the same time, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to store large quantities of fodder and solve the difficulty of insufficient feed by cultivating large quantities of short-season crops and other methods. In terms of feeding, it is necessary to universally promote the feeding methods of "crushed feed, fine grass, frequent additions, and less grazing"; add feed to postpartum mothers through mutual regulation, feed young animals with flour water to make them wean early and make the mothers come into heat quickly; and universally promote the methods of classified, separate, or single-trough feeding. In terms of use, it is necessary to help feeders and members establish a system of use and handover, strengthen the sense of responsibility of members and feeders; mobilize agricultural cooperatives to classify livestock according to the size of their teeth, the strength of their bodies, and the quality of their fatness, and formulate different work quotas according to categories, overcoming the phenomenon of random pulling and random harnessing, resulting in abnormal deaths. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen epidemic prevention work, conduct livestock competitions, and reward advanced events and units in breeding work.

Weinan County is one of the main producing areas of the famous Qin Chuan cattle and Guanzhong donkey in China. The produced cattle are large in body, solid in skeleton, and have smooth and fine hair, resembling lions. Farmers in many parts of the country regard Weinan cattle as a high-quality breed for breeding. However, farmers in this area did not have the habit of breeding livestock in large quantities in the past, and livestock developed very slowly. In order to ensure that agricultural cooperatives throughout the county have sufficient livestock and supply more breeding stock to other regions, the leading bodies of Weinan County have made full use of the superior conditions after collectivization, vigorously implemented the principle of "self-breeding, self-raising, and self-use," and mobilized the masses to breed livestock in large quantities.

In the past two years, the main experiences of Weinan County in breeding livestock are: First, attention has been paid to strengthening leadership and overall arrangement. A long-term plan for developing animal husbandry has been formulated, clarifying the direction of development. A livestock office has been established in the county, and the Party committees and Party branches of agricultural cooperatives have designated special personnel to be responsible for leading the work of developing livestock.

Second, new problems that arose after collectivization have been resolved in a timely manner. Local farmers once had the idea of ​​emphasizing agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry after collectivization. In response to this idea, the county has widely publicized the interdependent relationship between the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. The majority of farmers were made to understand that livestock is still the main driving force in agricultural production in my country for a considerable period of time, and it is also one of the main assets of the rural economy. For small livestock that were priced too low when joining the cooperative, the masses were mobilized to re-evaluate them, overcoming the bias of agricultural cooperatives only wanting strong livestock and excluding young, old and weak livestock. At the same time, it is advocated that members breed and raise small livestock individually. If members are unwilling to raise them, the agricultural cooperative will take them over for feeding; if members are willing to raise them, but are afraid of delaying earning work points during busy farming seasons, the cooperative will help them take care of them, and they will pay the cooperative some workdays, thus enhancing the members' interest in breeding livestock in large quantities.

Third, the labor remuneration for breeding and feeding personnel was correctly resolved, and various systems were stipulated to achieve "guaranteed breeding, guaranteed pregnancy, and guaranteed survival." The county universally organized livestock breeding households, veterinarians, epidemic prevention, and feeding personnel to sign contracts with each party responsible for their respective duties. It is stipulated that each breeding stock is bred with 150 to 180 females, giving 120 workdays, and 60% of the excess belongs to the livestock breeding households, which makes the livestock breeding households very enthusiastic. Generally, they carefully selected excellent breeds, and the number of breeding stocks quickly increased from more than 50 to more than 140, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient breeding stocks. It is stipulated that the feeder will be rewarded with three to five workdays for breeding a young animal, and feeders who ensure the safety of young animals and mothers will also be rewarded, which encourages the enthusiasm of the feeders.

Fourth, many simple and easy-to-implement systems have been established, such as dedicated personnel being responsible for feeding management, breeding, reproduction, use, handover, and rewards, and "three-link contracts" have been signed (the cooperative management committee is responsible for signing supply contracts with the feeders, the feeders sign contracts with the production team to guarantee the strength of the draft animals and that the mothers are not empty, and the members sign contracts with the production team to guarantee the use of the draft animals). This ensures that the livestock do not lose weight, are not empty, and that livestock breeding is guaranteed.

    槽头兴旺　保证增产
    渭南连续两年牲畜丰收，创造一般农业区繁殖牲畜最高纪录
    五年后繁殖耕畜到七万多头，争取提前五年达到四十条规定
    据新华社西安5日电　陕西省渭南县连续两年牲畜丰收，创造了我国一般农业区繁殖牲畜的最高纪录，并为这些地区发展牲畜提供了宝贵经验。
    渭南县在1955年下半年合作化以后，1956年共产驹、犊二千五百七十九头；1957年增殖到三千五百五十三头，比1956年增加15.12％，比合作化前提高31.42％，比解放前提高46％以上。现在全县怀有驹、犊的母畜还有三千头左右，预计这些母畜下生后，全县将共有牛、驴等大家畜五万四千头，不少农业社可作到“自给自足”。
    全国畜牧会议后，中共渭南县委会根据当地情况制定了第二个五年计划期间保护和繁殖牲畜的规划。保证要比全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的指标提前五年达到每个农业社都有足够使用的牲畜，并且基本上做到
  “槽头兴旺，四季平安。”按照规划，今后五年全县要繁殖大家畜到七万一千九百二十四头，比全县现有大家畜增加40.26％。从今年起，平均每年增加四千一百四十九头，纯增率要在第二个五年计划内的前三年由6％提高到7％，后两年由7.5％再提高到8％以上，赶上最近全国畜牧座谈会议上要求牧区达到的发展指标。到第五年除老残牲畜和幼畜外，全县将有六万多头健壮的耕畜，平均每头耕畜负担的耕地面积由现在的三十三点七亩，降低到二十三亩左右。
    渭南县属于一般农业区。当地领导机关非常重视繁殖牲畜工作的领导，各个农业社在繁殖和饲养牲畜中已经有一定的经验和基础。近两年来，全县牲畜繁殖很快。据九十三个农业社的调查，平均每年的纯增率已经达到6.65％。不少农业社已经做到母畜“年年产仔，个个成活”，个别母畜还年产两驹（犊）。疫病、乏瘦和不正常的死亡现象也大大减少或杜绝。渭南全县现在共有大家畜五万多头，其中有繁殖能力的母畜一万三千一百多头，预计在第二个五年计划期间的前三年，有繁殖能力的母畜的增加平均每年将有一万六千头，按平均每年有50％的牲畜配种，即可超额完成上述指标。
    渭南县还制定了保证完成上述指标的措施。计划要在全县继续发动群众开展突击配种运动，普遍组织养种畜农户、兽医和农业社签订三方面各负专责的合同，做到“保配、保胎、保成活”。同时，要发动群众大量储备饲草，用大量栽培短季作物等各种办法解决饲料不足的困难。在饲养方面要普遍推行“料碎、草细、勤添、少放”的饲养方法；用互相调剂的办法给产后的母畜加料，仔畜喂面水，使幼畜离奶早，母畜发情快；并普遍推行分类、分槽或单槽喂养的方法。在使役上要帮助饲养员和社员建立使役和接交制度，加强社员和饲养员的责任心；发动农业社根据牲畜的口齿大、小，身体的强弱，膘的好坏，分类排队，按类订出不同的使役定额，克服乱拉乱套，发生不正常的死亡现象。此外，还要加强防疫工作，进行牲畜评比，对饲养繁殖工作中的先进事例和单位进行奖励。
    渭南县是我国著名秦川牛和关中驴的主要产地之一。所产的牛躯体硕大，骨骼结实，毛光而细，状如狮子。全国许多地方的农民都把渭南的牛当作配种用的优良品种。但是，这个地区的农民过去没有大量繁殖牲畜的习惯，牲畜发展很慢。为了使全县农业社有足够的牲畜，并供给其他地区更多的种畜，渭南县的领导机关充分利用了合作化后的优越条件，大力贯彻“自繁、自养和自用”的原则，发动群众大量繁殖牲畜。
    过去两年，渭南县繁殖牲畜的主要经验是：一、注意了加强领导和全面安排。制定了发展畜牧业的远景规划，明确了发展的方向。在县上成立了畜牧办公室，中共县委、区委和农业社的党支部都指定专人负责，领导发展牲畜的工作。
    二、及时解决了合作化后发生的新问题。当地农民在合作化后曾经存在重农业、轻牧业的思想。针对这种思想，全县曾广泛宣传了发展农业和畜牧业互相依存的关系。使广大农民了解到牲畜在相当长的时期内仍是我国农业生产上的主要动力，也是农村经济的主要财产之一。对入社时作价偏低的小牲畜，发动群众进行另评，克服了农业社只要壮畜，排斥幼畜和老弱牲畜的偏向。同时提倡社员个人繁殖饲养小牲畜，社员不愿意养的由农业社包下来进行喂养；社员愿意养，但因为农忙时怕耽误挣工分，由社内帮助他们代为管养，他们付给社内一些劳动日，这样，增强了社员大量繁殖牲畜的兴趣。
    三、正确解决繁殖和饲养人员的劳动报酬，规定各种制度，做到“保配、保胎、保成活”。全县普遍组织养种畜农户、兽医、防疫和饲养人员订了三方面各负专责的合同。规定每一个种畜配一百五十到一百八十头母畜，给一百二十个劳动日，超过的60％归养种畜农户所有，使养种畜农户的情绪很高，一般都认真拣选了优良品种，种畜的头数也迅速由五十多头，增加到一百四十多头，克服了种畜不足的困难。规定繁殖一头幼畜给饲养员奖励三至五个劳动日，还对保证仔畜、母畜安全的饲养员，进行奖励，鼓舞了饲养员的积极性。
    四、建立了专人负责饲养管理、配种、繁殖、使役、交接、奖励等许多简便易行的制度，订立了“三连环合同”（社管理委员会负责和饲养员订立供应合同，饲养员和生产队订保证役畜体力壮、母畜不空怀合同，社员和生产队订立使役合同），这样做到了牲畜不掉膘色，不空怀，使牲畜繁殖得到保证。
