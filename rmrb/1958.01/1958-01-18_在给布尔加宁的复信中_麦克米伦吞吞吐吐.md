    Xinhua News Agency, London, 17th January: London dispatch: British Prime Minister Macmillan's reply to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin's letter of December 11th was published in London on the 17th. This letter is in response to Bulganin's letter of December 11th.

    After professing that the British government also hopes to "promote peace" and "will never take, participate in, or condone acts of aggression against the Soviet Union," Macmillan went on to talk about the issue of concluding a non-aggression pact that he raised in his radio address on January 4th. He said that non-aggression "is a concept inherent in the United Nations Charter," but "such a guarantee may be useful at present." At the same time, he said that in order to avoid "casting doubt on the provisions of the United Nations Charter," "any form of bilateral or multilateral declaration" (concerning non-aggression) still "requires further consideration."

    In his reply, Macmillan attempted to shirk the responsibility that Western countries should bear for obstructing the relaxation of international tensions and hindering disarmament, and defended the proposals previously put forward by the West. He once again avoided the substantive issue of disarmament and emphasized the need to focus on the issue of "inspection and supervision," believing that this is "necessary for building trust." He also reiterated the Western position, insisting on "unifying" Germany according to Western conditions.

    Among the many specific proposals put forward by Bulganin, Macmillan expressed some interest in the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. He said: "The newly proposed suggestion is that countries possessing nuclear weapons should reach an agreement through consultation, stipulating that nuclear weapons shall not be produced or deployed on the territories of Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. This proposal, which has already been put forward by the Polish government, has some obvious objections, but the British government is currently studying this proposal to see if there are any elements in it that can serve as the basis for putting forward some alternative proposals."

    The latter part of Macmillan's reply concerned the issue of holding an East-West summit meeting. He expressed agreement that personal contact between the heads of state of the East and West "does have a role to play in seeking a solution that we all hope for." However, he then quoted the words of the Paris Communiqué of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, expressing the hope that a meeting of foreign ministers should be held first to resolve the deadlock in disarmament issues. Macmillan avoided directly answering Bulganin's specific proposals in his second letter of January 8th regarding the convening of a summit conference, saying that he was "considering" these proposals. He will return to this issue when replying to the second letter.

    在给布尔加宁的复信中
    麦克米伦吞吞吐吐
    据新华社伦敦17日电　伦敦消息：英国首相麦克米伦给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的复信17日在伦敦发表。这封信是答复布尔加宁12月11日的信件的。
    麦克米伦在表白了一番英国政府也希望“促进和平”和“决不会采取、参与或宽恕侵略苏联的行为”之后接着谈到他在1月4日的广播演说中提出的关于缔结互不侵犯公约的问题。他说，互不侵犯“是联合国宪章中所固有的一种观念”，但是“这种保证在目前可能是有用处的”。同时，他又说，为了要避免“使人对联合国宪章的规定产生怀疑”，“任何（有关互不侵犯的）双边或多边宣言的形式”还“需要作进一步的考虑”。
    麦克米伦在复信里企图推脱西方国家在阻挠缓和国际紧张局势和阻挠实现裁军方面所应负的责任，并且替西方过去提出的方案辩解。他再次避开裁军的实质问题而强调要着重解决“检查和监督”问题，认为这是“建立信任所需要的”。他还重申西方的立场，坚持按照西方的条件来“统一”德国。
    在布尔加宁提出的许多具体建议中间，麦克米伦对关于在中欧设立无原子武器区的建议表示出某些兴趣。他说：“新提出的建议是：由拥有原子核武器的国家通过商谈而达成协议，规定在德国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的领土上不得生产或者设置原子核武器。已经由波兰政府提出过的这个建议是有一些显然会受到人们的反对的地方的，但是英国政府目前正在研究这种建议，看看其中是否有某些内容可以作为提出某种替代性的建议的基础。”
    麦克米伦复信的后一部分谈到举行东西方最高级会议问题。他表示同意东西方国家首脑的个人接触“在求得我们大家都盼望的解决方面的确是有其作用的”。但是他接着引用北大西洋集团理事会巴黎会议公报中的话，表示希望先召开外交部长级会议来解决裁军问题的僵局。麦克米伦避免正面答复布尔加宁在1月8日的第二封信中提出的关于召开政府首脑会议的一些具体建议，他说，他“正在考虑”这些建议。他将在答复第二封信的时候重新谈到这个问题。
