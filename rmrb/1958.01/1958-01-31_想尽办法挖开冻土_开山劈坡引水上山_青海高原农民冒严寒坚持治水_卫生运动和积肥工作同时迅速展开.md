Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 30th – The Qinghai Plateau is now experiencing its coldest time of the year, but the various ethnic groups of peasants are still braving wind, snow, and cold to persist in constructing water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer, their enthusiasm undiminished. To date, the completed and ongoing winter water conservancy projects in the province are expected to irrigate 830,000 mu of land, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated has reached 80% of the annual planned amount.

Most of the water conservancy projects in Qinghai Province involve diverting water uphill, which requires opening mountains and splitting slopes. However, the surface frozen soil layer is two to three chi thick. After being dug up, it immediately freezes again when work stops, making excavation more difficult each day. The various ethnic groups of peasants have devised many methods to conquer nature. They light fires to thaw the frozen layer, cover the newly dug soil with loose soil during breaks to prevent it from freezing, and implement a three-shift system to work day and night, not stopping until the frozen layer is completely excavated. Young people organize shock teams to dig up the frozen soil and then hand over the project to others. Some agricultural cooperatives have moved blacksmith furnaces to the construction site to repair worn-out tools at any time. In order to complete the irrigation of 500,000 mu of land before the spring plowing, the various ethnic groups of peasants plan to not rest or rest very little during the Spring Festival. They put forward revolutionary slogans full of vigor: "Spend the New Year on the dam, seek grain from the dam"; "Work until the 29th day of the twelfth lunar month, and start again after the third day of the new year." While building various small-scale water conservancy projects, the various ethnic groups of peasants also pay attention to storing ice and water, sweeping snow into the fields, and making various drought prevention preparations.

The fertilizer accumulation work has also been progressing rapidly recently. Some areas or agricultural cooperatives that did not pay enough attention to fertilizer accumulation have basically achieved everyone taking action and every cooperative accumulating fertilizer after visits and comparisons organized by the province and county. Liangqi Agricultural Cooperative in Huangzhong County successfully used local peat to ferment and compost fertilizer, opening up a vast source of fertilizer for agricultural production. Mountain areas lack human and animal manure, but peat reserves are very abundant. After many agricultural cooperatives sent people to visit and learn from the Liangqi Cooperative, they also began to dig peat for composting. Various places are also taking advantage of the winter to transport fertilizer to the fields. Based on the progress of fertilizer accumulation work, this year's farmland can be fertilized by more than 30% than last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 30th – The patriotic health movement in Qinghai Plateau, centered on Xining City, is rapidly expanding to the province's agricultural and pastoral areas and remote ethnic minority areas such as the Qaidam Basin.

Xining City, which started the movement earlier, has entered its second movement month after completing the first patriotic health movement month. The masses in Chengguan Town, Huangyuan County, organized twenty-one youth shock teams to completely eliminate blind spots and helped families without labor to clean up manure and garbage. While eliminating rats and sparrows, the county also built many pigsties and toilets, clearing more than 160 tons of garbage and manure, which increased a large amount of fertilizer resources for farmers. The Qaidam Basin is also carrying out a large-scale winter sanitation campaign to eliminate overwintering mosquitoes.

In order to deepen the health movement and make it "known to every household," Xining City and various counties have respectively convened youth mobilization meetings and mass representative meetings for "eliminating the four pests."

    想尽办法挖开冻土　开山劈坡引水上山
    青海高原农民冒严寒坚持治水
    卫生运动和积肥工作同时迅速展开
    新华社西宁30日电　青海高原现在到了一年中最寒冷的时节，但各族农民仍冒着风雪和寒冷坚持兴修水利，积攒肥料，干劲十足。到
  目前止，全省完成和正在施工的冬季水利工程，共可灌地八十三万亩，积攒的肥料达到了全年计划施肥量的80％。
    青海省绝大部分水利工程是引水上山，需要开山劈坡，但地面冻土层有两三尺厚，挖开后一停工又马上冻住，挖土方一天比一天更困难。各族农民想了许多办法征服自然。他们生火煨化冰冻层，休工时用松土盖住使新土不冻，实行昼夜动工的三班制，挖开冻层后不修完不停工。青年人组织突击队，挖开冻土再把工程交给别人干。有的农业社把铁匠炉搬到工地，随时修整被磨损的工具。为了抢在春耕前完成五十万亩地的灌溉工程，各族农民打算春节期间不休息或少休息。他们提出充满着革命干劲的口号：“年在坝上过，粮向坝中求”；“修到腊月二十九，过了初三又动手”。在兴修各种小型水利工程的同时，各族农民还注意养冰蓄水，扫雪归田，做各种防旱准备。
    积肥工作近来进展也很快。有些不重视积肥的地区或农业社，经过由省和县组织的参观评比，也基本上做到了人人动手，社社积肥。湟中县两旗农业社利用当地的泥炭发酵沤制肥料成功，为农业生产开辟了广大肥源。山区的人畜粪肥比较缺乏，但泥炭蕴藏量很丰富，许多农业社派人到两旗社参观和学习经验以后，也开始挖取泥炭沤制。各地还在趁冬季送肥上地。根据积肥工作的进度看，今年的农田可以比去年增施肥料30％以上。
    据新华社西宁30日电　青海高原的爱国卫生运动，正以西宁市为中心迅速地扩展到全省的农牧业区和柴达木盆地等少数民族聚居的边远地区。
    运动开展较早的西宁市在完成了第一个爱国卫生运动月后，紧接着又迈入第二个运动月。湟源县城关镇群众组织了二十一个青年突击队彻底消灭了空白点，并帮助无劳力的家庭清扫粪便和垃圾。全县在消灭老鼠和麻雀的同时，还修了许多猪圈和厕所，清除垃圾和粪便一百六十多吨，给农民增加了大量肥源。柴达木盆地也正开展大规模的消灭越冬蚊虫的冬季卫生运动。
    为了使卫生运动深入开展和“家喻户晓”，西宁市和各县都分别召开了“除四害”的青年誓师大会和群众代表大会。
