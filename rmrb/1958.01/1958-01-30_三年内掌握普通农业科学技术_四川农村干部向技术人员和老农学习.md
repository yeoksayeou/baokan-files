    Mastering General Agricultural Science and Technology in Three Years
    Rural Cadres in Sichuan Learn from Technicians and Experienced Farmers
    (Reported by our correspondent Ji Xichen, Chengdu, January 29th) To promote agricultural technological reform and ensure a leap forward in agricultural production, Sichuan Province is organizing rural cadres to advance towards agricultural science and technology, while also training a large number of junior agricultural technicians, actively organizing a basic force for popularizing agricultural science and technology in rural areas.
    In order to strive to achieve the target of 800 jin per mu stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, the broad masses of rural cadres are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, which requires rural work cadres to master general agricultural science and technology knowledge within three years, and are actively studying and delving into agricultural science knowledge to train themselves into both red and expert rural workers. Nanchong Prefecture has universally combined agricultural activities, organized short-term technical training for cadres in rotation, and used various cadre meetings to impart technical knowledge, setting off a wave of enthusiasm for learning agricultural technology. More than ten counties, including Nanchong, Xichong, and Guang'an, have held technical conferences from the county to the township level. At the conferences, in addition to agricultural technical cadres systematically lecturing on agricultural science and technology knowledge to the cadres and farmer representatives present, model exhibitions and technical demonstrations of advanced agricultural technologies were also held. Ge Runsheng, First Secretary of the Nanchong Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, also led more than two hundred county, district, and township party secretaries to the fields to learn the cultivation techniques of cotton, sweet potatoes, and rice. They listened to agronomists lecture on the theoretical knowledge of soil, climate, crop growth, and pests and diseases, while also conducting field operations and experiments under the guidance of experienced farmers. Because leading cadres at all levels took the lead in learning technology, many advanced technologies and yield-increasing measures were quickly implemented.
    Organizing visits and evaluations, combining experimental fields with agricultural technology innovation, and immediately applying the learned agricultural technology knowledge to experimental fields is one of the important forms of cadres advancing towards technology. In Nanbu County, under the leadership of Qi Shixun, the county party secretary, leading cadres at the county, district, and township levels have all cultivated high-yield demonstration fields. Before each important agricultural season, cadres invite agricultural technicians and experienced farmers to lecture on technical knowledge, and then boldly carry out technological innovations in light of actual conditions. For example, cotton has implemented seedling promotion and topdressing during the flowering period; sweet potatoes have implemented warm bed seedling cultivation, long vine close planting, and high ridge manure wrapping; and rice has implemented small-plant close planting and uniform transplanting, all of which have achieved high yields. Zhao Dengliang, the secretary of the Shengzhong Township branch, achieved a yield of 190 jin per mu of cotton in his demonstration field, which is more than six times the local average yield. In order to make advanced technology universally promoted among the masses, the county also organized more than 40,000 people to visit and evaluate the demonstration fields.
    Various agricultural technology training classes, technical night schools, and agricultural cooperative cadre schools have also been held in various places to train a large number of junior technicians for agricultural cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics, there are now more than 600,000 agricultural technicians in the province who have been trained. Together with more than 700 agricultural technology extension stations and more than 8,000 full-time agricultural technical cadres distributed throughout the region, they are forming a basic force for popularizing agricultural science and technology in rural areas, closely combining agricultural technology guidance with the production practices of the peasant masses.

    三年内掌握普通农业科学技术
    四川农村干部向技术人员和老农学习
    本报成都29日电　记者纪希晨报道：促进农业技术改革，保证农业生产跃进，四川省组织农村干部向农业科学技术进军，同时并培训大批农业初级技术员，在农村积极组织普及农业科学技术的基本队伍。
    为了争取提前实现农业发展纲要规定的亩产八百斤的指标，广大农村干部，热烈响应中共四川省委要求农村工作干部在三年内掌握普通农业科学技术知识的号召，积极学习和钻研农业科学知识，要把自己锻炼成又红又专的农村工作者。南充专区普遍结合农事活动，在干部中组织技术短期轮训，利用各种干部会议，进行技术传授，掀起学习农业技术的热潮。南充、西充、广安等十多个县，从县到乡都召开了技术大会，会上除由农业技术干部向到会干部和农民代表系统讲述农业科学技术知识外，还举办了农业先进技术的模型展览和技术表演。中共南充地委第一书记戈润生并率领二百多个县、区、乡的党委书记，到田间学习棉花、红苕、水稻的栽培技术。他们一面请农学家讲授土壤、气候、作物生长和病虫害的理论知识，一面在老农指导下实地在田间操作试验。由于各级领导干部带头学习技术，许多先进技术和增产措施迅速得到了贯彻。
    组织参观评比，把试验田和农业技术革新结合起来，将学习的农业技术知识立即运用到试验田中去，是干部向技术进军的重要形式之一。南部县在县委书记齐世勋带头下，县、区、当各级领导干部都培植了丰产示范田。在每一重要农事季节之前，干部们都邀请农业技术人员和老农讲授技术知识，然后结合实际大胆地进行技术革新。例如棉花推行提苗、花期增施追肥；红苕实行温床育苗、长藤密植、高厢包粪；水稻推行小株密植、铲秧匀栽之后，都获得了高额产量。升钟乡支部书记赵登良的示范田中的棉花，亩产高达一百九十斤，超过了当地平均产量六倍以上。为使先进技术在群众中普遍得到推广，全县还组织了四万多人对示范田进行参观评比。
    各地还通过举办各种农业技术训练班、技术夜校、农业合作社干部学校，为农业社训练大批初级技术员。据不完全统计，全省现在经过训练的农业技术员，已有六十多万人。他们正同分布各地的七百多处农业技术推广站和八千多专职农业技术干部，在农村组成了一支普及农业科学技术的基本队伍，把农业技术指导和农民群众的生产实践密切结合起来。
