To achieve good results and avoid injuries during winter physical exercise, participants should pay attention to the following points.

	I. Do a good warm-up. In winter exercise, you should first do freehand exercises, jogging, and other warm-up activities, and then enter the formal exercise. Because doing warm-up activities can make you warm up your joints faster and warm your whole body, which can reduce the occurrence of injuries in rapid exercise.

	II. Pay attention to prevent colds. Before starting exercise, don't run outdoors with too little clothing, and should gradually expose your body to colder air. If, after doing warm-up exercises, your body gets a little hot, then take off a little more clothing. Once you are sweating all over from formal activities, you cannot take off any more clothes. After exercise, you should immediately add clothes and don't let your body feel cool or cold. If possible, it is best to wipe off sweat or take a shower, and then change into underwear.

	III. Do not exercise when the weather is too cold or the wind is too strong. When there is no wind or the wind does not exceed level 2, and the temperature is between -8 degrees and -12 degrees Celsius, it is most suitable for exercise. If the wind exceeds level 6 and the temperature is lower than -20 degrees Celsius, it is not advisable to do outdoor exercise. Do not do strenuous exercise when you are sleep-deprived or feeling unwell, but you can do some light activities.

	IV. People with weak bodies should carry out activities suitable for their physical condition according to their individual circumstances, such as doing morning exercises, walking, practicing Tai Chi, or skating, and should never engage in strenuous exercise.

	V. Regardless of physical fitness, you should strictly adhere to the principle of gradual progress in exercise, and do not rush for quick results. Groups or individuals who have established exercise plans should not set the plans too high, and should check them at any time. If they are not appropriate, they must be revised in time.

    冬季锻炼中要注意些什么
    为了在冬季体育锻炼中能取得好的效果和避免发生伤害事故，参加锻炼的人要注意下列各点。
    一、要做好准备活动。在冬季锻炼中应该先做徒手操、慢跑等准备活动，然后再进入正式锻炼。因为做准备活动可以使你更快地把关节活动得开，全身发热，这样就可以减少在急剧运动中发生伤害事故。
    二、要注意防止感冒。开始锻炼前不要穿得很少就跑出室外，应该使身体逐渐接触较冷的空气。如果，做了准备活动身体有点发热，那时再少去一点衣服。等正式活动到全身出了汗，那就不能再去衣服了。锻炼完后应该立即加衣服，不要使身体感到凉或冷。如果有条件最好能把汗擦干或洗澡，然后再换上内衣。
    三、天气太冷或风势过大时不要进行锻炼。当无风或不超过二级风，气温为零下8度——12度时，进行锻炼最为合适。如果风势超过六级，气温低于零下20度，就不宜再进行户外锻炼。睡眠不足或身体不适时也不要进行剧烈的锻炼，可做些轻微的活动。
    四、体弱的人应该根据个人情况进行对自己体质合适的活动，如做早操、走步、打太极拳或滑冰等，绝对不能进行剧烈的锻炼。
    五、无论体质如何，在锻炼中都应该严格掌握循序渐进的原则，不能急于求成。订有锻炼计划的集体或个人，不可把计划订得过高，应该随时加以检查，不妥当的一定要及时修改。　（集纳）
