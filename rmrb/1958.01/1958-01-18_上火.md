"Getting a Fire"
	Zhu Yan

	Our ancient people discovered fire very early on, and invented drilling wood to make fire (see Yi Shi, Bai Hu Tong, Tai Ping Yu Lan) very early on, and also had a profound understanding of the basic characteristics of fire. Everyone knew very early on that fire rises upwards (see Shangshu Hongfan), that fire is red (see Hanshu Wuxing Zhi), and that fire is hot (see Huangdi Neijing Suwen Yinyang Yingxiang Da Lun). Therefore, the concept derived from the natural phenomenon of fire was quickly applied to daily life. For example, describing something as lively is called "as blazing as fire," and getting angry is called "getting a fire," and so on.

	From a medical point of view, all phenomena that are hot and red, such as the heart and blood, are represented by "fire." The use of "fire" is even more common in discussing pathological phenomena, for example: "Fire qi is internally stagnated, causing sores in the middle, spreading to the outside," "When fire is burning, the throat is dry," "Fire qi develops internally, causing oral erosion," "All heat, dizziness, and convulsions belong to fire," "All diseases with swelling, pain, soreness, shock, and fright belong to fire" (all from Huangdi Neijing Suwen). The sores, dry throat, oral erosion (i.e., mouth ulcers), heat, dizziness, convulsions (i.e., fever, confusion, and convulsions), and swelling, pain, and soreness mentioned in these examples all involve symptoms of inflammation to some extent. Modern medicine summarizes the main characteristics of inflammation as redness, swelling, pain, heat, and functional impairment. Traditional Chinese medicine often uses a single word "fire" to describe these characteristics of inflammation. Therefore, in life, we are accustomed to calling conjunctivitis (red eyes) "eye getting fire," pharyngitis or tonsillitis (sore throat) "throat getting fire," oral inflammation, sores on the tongue, toothache, cracked and painful lips, etc., all "getting fire"; there are also some more serious skin inflammations called wind fire, erysipelas, fire poison, and flowing fire, etc. In short, so-called getting a fire can be said to be inflammation.

	It should be noted that in traditional Chinese medicine literature, the philosophical theories of yin-yang and the five elements are often used to explain some medical problems. The five elements are wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Fire is one of the five elements, and like the other four, it has a wide range of meanings in medicine. What is said here only involves the "fire" of getting a fire. It is not a complete explanation of the meaning of fire in medicine.

	Strictly speaking, "getting a fire" is a general term. People don't seek a thorough understanding, don't actively seek treatment, and are careless, as a result, a single spark can start a prairie fire, and small illnesses are often dragged into big ones. This is not good. People who often "get a fire" should have a check-up to see what the illness is. Otherwise, allowing the fire to become increasingly rampant, burning them to a frazzle, and failing to put out the fire in time, they will inevitably die.

	So it is with physical "getting a fire," and so it is with "getting a fire" in ideological cultivation!

    “上火”
    朱颜
    我国古代人民很早就发现了火，并且很早就发明了钻木取火（见绎史、白虎通、太平御览），对火的基本特性也早有了深刻的认识。大家很早就知道火是向上炎的（见尚书洪范），火是赤色的（见汉书五行志），火是热的（见黄帝内经素问阴阳应象大论）。因此，从火这个自然现象获得的概念，就很快地应用到日常生活中去。例如形容热闹称为“如火如荼”，发怒叫做“发火”等等。
    从医学来说，凡是炎热和红色的现象，例如心和血，就用“火”来代表。在论述病理现象方面，用“火”的地方更是常见，例如：“火气内郁，疮疡于中，流散于外”，“火见燔焫，嗌燥”，“火气内发，上为口糜”，“诸热瞀瘈，皆属于火”，“诸病胕肿，疼酸惊骇，皆属于火”（均见黄帝内经素问）。这些例子中所说的疮疡、嗌（即嗓子）燥、口糜（即口疮）、诸热瞀瘈（即发热昏闷和抽风）、胕肿（即浮肿）疼酸等病症，都多少牵涉到发炎的症状。现代医学总结发炎的主要特点为红、肿、痛、热和官能障碍。而祖国医学对这些炎症的特点则往往用一个“火”字来形容。因此，我们在生活里习惯于把结膜发炎（红眼睛）叫做眼睛上火，咽喉发炎或扁桃体发炎（闹嗓子）叫做嗓子上火，口腔发炎、舌头生疮、牙齿痛、嘴唇裂痛等等也都叫做上火；还有其他一些比较严重的皮肤炎症，叫做风火、火丹、火毒、流火等等。总之，所谓上火，可以说就是炎症。
    要说明的是，祖国医学文献中，常常借用阴阳五行的哲学学说来阐述医学上的一些问题。五行就是木、火、土、金、水。火是五行之一，和其余四者一样，在医学上都有很广泛的涵义。这里说的只牵涉到上火的“火”。并非是对火在医药上的意义的全部解释。
    严格地来说，上火是个笼统的说法。人们也不求甚解，不去积极求治，马马虎虎，结果星星之火可以燎原，常常把小病拖成大病。这不好。常常“上火”的人应当去检查一下，看究竟是什么病。否则，任凭火势日益猖獗，烧得焦头烂额，救火不及，不免呜呼哀哉了。
    肉体上的“上火”如此，思想修养上的“上火”也莫不如此！
