Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 21st: The people of Hong'an County, Hubei Province, an old revolutionary base area, have consistently maintained a spirit of hard struggle in their work of healing wounds and rebuilding their homes. Now, Hong'an County has changed the desolate appearance originally created by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and everywhere presents a thriving scene.

As early as before 1927, the people of Hong'an County (then called Huang'an) had established a Soviet regime of workers, peasants, and soldiers under the leadership of the Communist Party, and had repeatedly repelled the invasions of the Kuomintang reactionary armed forces. After the main force of the Red Army went north to resist Japan, they continued to persevere in the struggle, and the struggle in some areas continued until liberation. During these years of struggle, Hong'an County suffered severe damage from the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, the Party and the government led the people here to rebuild their homes on the barren land. At that time, due to the small labor force and the lack of agricultural tools and cattle, although the state provided great assistance, the work of rebuilding homes still faced considerable difficulties. However, the people of Hong'an County finally emerged from the difficulties through their own hard work with their own diligent hands. For example, before 1927, Yangshan Township had a total of 52 villages with more than 3,900 people, but by the time of liberation, only 28 dilapidated villages with more than 1,100 people remained. 70% of the land was barren. More than 80 large breaches were broken in the dikes of the Panyang River, which runs through the entire township, and more than 500 mu of fertile land along the river became a sandy area. Under such serious difficulties, the township set up 11 agricultural cooperatives, and men, women, old and young all worked together to repair the Panyang River embankment, and dug out 450 mu of fields from the river sand. At the same time, they also reclaimed and renovated more than 1,700 mu of fields. These two items alone increased the township's grain production by more than 1.8 million jin. Since liberation, the county has reclaimed more than 10,000 mu of wasteland and barren land with hoes and human-pulled plows, and improved more than 35,000 mu of soil, and last year, for the first time, double-cropping rice and a single crop of late japonica rice were planted, which played a significant role in achieving an overall substantial increase in production.

Trying every possible way to reduce expenses is a characteristic of the people of Hong'an County in their work of rebuilding their homes. For example, the county accumulated 100 million dan of natural fertilizer last year, an increase of one-quarter compared with 1956, while the amount of chemical fertilizer and miscellaneous fertilizer purchased was greatly reduced compared with the past. In 1956, agricultural cooperatives generally purchased cake fertilizer for fertilizing the fields, while last year the cake fertilizer was processed and produced by the cooperatives themselves, saving 30,000 yuan on this item alone. The newly built cattle pens, pigsties, etc. in the agricultural cooperatives also cost very little money or no money at all. In the past, the Kaikang Township in the mountains was burned and killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and there were no people within a radius of forty li. After liberation, 716 people gradually moved back from outside. The township set up five agricultural cooperatives. Among them, the Tiantai Agricultural Cooperative had 47 households of members. When the cooperative was established, there were only nine head of cattle and fifteen pieces of agricultural tools. Later, they accumulated money to buy seven cows, and last year they trained the twenty calves born by the cows into cattle. Lacking agricultural tools, the members used scrap iron to make their own agricultural tools. Last year, a total of 55 plows, harrows, cultivators, and three waterwheels were made. The fertilizer was entirely self-accumulated green manure, sod, and manure. The cooperative used pine resin for lighting for meetings and offices, and the annual management fee was only eight yuan. As a result, the actual income of the cooperative increased a lot compared with the previous year. At the same time, the members' idea of "taking the cooperative as their home" has also been established. For example, the Third Agricultural Cooperative of Yangshan Township lacked fertilizer during spring production last year and did not have money to buy it. Pan Yanggao, the family member of a revolutionary martyr, invested 140 yuan in the cooperative one after another. Driven by him, members invested more than 1,400 yuan in the cooperative in a few days, solving the fertilizer difficulties and helping the cooperative develop sideline production. Due to the members' love for the cooperative as their home, the state's loans to agricultural cooperatives decreased year by year, and last year it decreased by more than two-thirds compared with 1956.

The people of Hong'an County are also very prominent in saving food. Although the county achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest last year, and every household's granary was full, many families mixed coarse grains and vegetables in every meal, morning, noon, and evening. In order to save staple food, the people of Hong'an County planted sorghum, mung beans, and other miscellaneous grain crops on almost all the ridges and edges of the fields last year, and also opened up many wastelands to plant pumpkins, cabbage, radishes, etc. Last year, the county's miscellaneous grain harvest alone was 4 million jin, and coupled with various vegetables, it is estimated that it can save 7 million jin of staple food. At the same time, the people of Hong'an County also collected more than 60 million jin of more than 100 kinds of wild feed to feed pigs, accounting for 70% of the total pig feed. Through such painstaking efforts to be diligent and thrifty, the people of Hong'an County, in addition to overfulfilling the state's grain procurement tasks, also sold more than 7 million jin of grain saved last year to the state.

    艰苦奋斗改变老根据地面貌
    湖北红安县空前大丰收家家粮满仓
    新华社武汉21日电　革命老根据地湖北省红安县的人民，在医治创伤、重建家园的工作中一直保持着艰苦奋斗的精神。现在红安县已经改变了原来被国民党反动派造成的一片凄凉的面貌，到处呈现着欣欣向荣的景象。
    早在1927年以前，红安县（当时叫黄安）人民就在共产党的领导下建立过工农兵苏维埃政权，并且无数次击退了国民党反动武装的进犯。红军主力北上抗日后，他们继续坚持斗争，有些地区的斗争一直坚持到解放。在这些斗争的年代里，红安县受到了国民党反动派的惨重破坏。解放以后，党和政府领导这里的人民，在荒芜了的土地上重新建设自己的家园。当时由于劳动力少，农具、耕牛不足，国家虽然给予了极大帮助，但重建家园工作仍有相当严重的困难。但是红安县人民用自己勤劳的双手艰苦劳动，终于从重重困难中走了出来。例如，杨山乡在1927年前共有五十二个村子、三千九百多人，到解放时只剩下二十八个残破不全的村子，一千一百多人。田地荒芜70％。贯通全乡的潘阳河河堤被洪水冲破了八十多个大缺口，沿河两岸五百多亩良田成了一片沙丘。在这样严重困难的情况下，全乡办了十一个农业社，男女老幼一齐动手，修复了潘阳河堤，从河沙里扒出了四百五十亩田。同时，还开垦修整了一千七百多亩田。仅这两项，就使全乡增产粮食一百八十多万斤。解放以来，全县用锄头挖、用人拉犁开垦出来的荒田荒地达一万多亩，改良土壤三万五千多亩，并且在去年首次种植了双季稻和一季晚粳，对获得全面大增产起了很大作用。
    想尽一切办法缩小开支是红安县人民重建家园工作中的一个特色。例如全县去年积自然肥料一亿担，比1956年增加了四分之一，而购买化肥和杂肥的数量却比过去大大减少。1956年各农业社普遍购买饼肥肥田，而去年饼肥都由合作社自己加工制作，仅这一项就节省了三万元。各农业社新建的牛栏、猪圈等也很少花钱或者没有花钱。大山中开荒乡过去被国民党反动派烧杀一光，方圆四十里内人烟绝迹，解放后，陆续从外面迁回的有七百一十六人，全乡办了五个农业社，其中天台农业社有四十七户社员，建社时只有九头耕牛，十五件农具。后来积钱买了七头母牛，去年又把母牛生下的二十头小牛训练成耕牛。缺乏农具，社员们就用废铁自己做农具。去年一共做了五十五件犁、耙、耖和三部水车。肥料完全是自己积的绿肥、草皮和大粪。社里开会、办公都是用松树脂做灯，一年的管理费只用了八元，结果全社实际收入比前一年增加了很多。同时，社员们“以社为家”的思想也树立起来了，例如，杨山乡第三农业社去年春季生产时缺少肥料，又没有钱买，革命烈士家属潘杨高便先后向社里投资一百四十元，经他一带动，没几天工夫社员们就向社里投资一千四百多元，解决了肥料困难，还帮助社里发展了副业生产。由于社员们这种爱社如家的结果，使国家向农业社投放的贷款一年比一年减少，去年比1956年减少了三分之二以上。
    红安县人民节约粮食也很突出。去年虽然全县获得空前大丰收，户户粮满仓，但是许多人家早晚三餐，顿顿都掺有杂粮和蔬菜。为了节省主粮，红安县人民去年几乎在所有的田埂地边都种植了高粱、绿豆等杂粮作物，还开了许多荒地种植南瓜、白菜、萝卜等。这个县去年仅收的杂粮就有四百万斤，加上各种蔬菜，估计能够节省主粮七百万斤。同时红安县人民还采集了一百多种共六千多万斤野生饲料来喂猪，占生猪饲料总量的70％。经过这样千方百计地克勤克俭，红安县人民除了超额完成国家的粮食征购任务以外，还把去年节约下来的七百多万斤粮食卖给了国家。
