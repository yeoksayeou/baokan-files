Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 9th. The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held its first plenary session of the year on the 8th. The meeting unanimously passed on first and second readings the resolution on the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) for the Development of the National Economy of the German Democratic Republic and the National Economic Tasks for 1958.

The First Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Witkowski, pointed out in his report on the Second Five-Year Plan: Despite the general difficulties of the transition from capitalism to socialism and the special difficulties caused by the division of Germany, socialism still occupies an unbreakable and consolidated position in Germany today. In terms of production scale, the German Democratic Republic has now become the fifth largest industrial country in Europe.

During the Second Five-Year Plan, especially between 1958 and 1960, efforts will be concentrated on solving these tasks: prioritizing the development of basic raw material industries, primarily the production of coal, power, chemicals, and building materials; improving technology to ensure the continuous improvement of labor productivity; greatly increasing the production of agricultural commodities; continuing to expand housing construction and greatly increasing the production of consumer goods. The allocation of state investment is also determined according to these tasks. The total investment in the Second Five-Year Plan amounts to 55 billion marks, an increase of 88% over the First Five-Year Plan.

The report said that the total output value of socialist industrial enterprises in 1960 would increase by 40% compared to 1955, thus accounting for about 90% of the total industrial output value. In this way, the total industrial output value of the German Democratic Republic will increase from 46 billion marks in 1955 to 56.7 billion marks in 1958.

In discussing the agricultural plan, he said that agricultural production cooperatives will surpass individual farmers in the production of various commercial agricultural products in 1960. He said that if the agricultural tasks between 1958 and 1960 can be solved, the German Democratic Republic will not only be able to abolish the rationing system, but also further improve the lives of the working people and place the development of the entire national economy in a more favorable position.

The People's Chamber also unanimously approved the budget案 of the German Democratic Republic for 1958 on this day.

    民主德国人民议院
    通过第二个五年计划
    优先发展基本原料工业，提高农业商品生产，投资总额将比第一个五年计划增加88％
    据新华社柏林9日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院8日举行今年第一次全体会议。会议一致首读和二读通过了民主德国第二个发展国民经济五年计划（1956—1960年）和1958年国家经济任务的决议。
    国家计划委员会第一副主席维特科夫斯基在作关于第二个五年计划的报告时指出：尽管存在着从资本主义到社会主义的过渡期间的一般困难以及由于德国的分裂而造成的特殊困难，但是，今天在德国，社会主义依然占有了一个牢不可破的巩固地位。就生产规模来说，德意志民主共和国目前已经成为欧洲的第五个工业国。
    在第二个五年计划期间，特别是在1958到1960年期间内，将集中力量解决这些任务：优先发展基本原料工业，首先是煤炭、动力、化学和建筑材料的生产；改进技术，以保证劳动生产率的经常提高；大大提高农业商品的生产；继续扩大住宅建筑和大大提高消费品的生产。国家投资的分配也是依照这些任务来确定的。第二个五年计划中的投资总额达五百五十亿马克，即比第一个五年计划增加88％。
    报告说：1960年社会主义工业企业的总产值将比1955年增加40％，从而将占全部工业生产总产值的90％左右。这样，民主德国的工业总产值就要从1955年的四百六十亿马克增加到1958年的五百六十七亿马克。
    他在谈到农业计划时说：农业生产合作社在1960年将在各种商品农产品生产中超过个体农民。他说：如果能够解决1958年到1960年间的农业任务，民主德国就将不仅能够废除配给制，而且还能够进一步改善劳动人民的生活、并且使全部国民经济的发展处于更有利的地位。
    人民议院还在这一天一致通过了民主德国1958年预算案。
