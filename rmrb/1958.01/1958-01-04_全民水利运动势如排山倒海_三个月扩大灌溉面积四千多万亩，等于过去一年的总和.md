The mass water conservancy construction movement is advancing at an unprecedented speed. From the beginning of October to the end of December 1957, in less than three months, the irrigated area expanded by over 47 million mu in various regions.

The irrigated area expanded in these three months exceeds the total irrigated area expanded in the year from the winter of 1956 to the autumn harvest of 1957, and is more than three times the amount completed during the first water conservancy upsurge in the winter of 1955. The national planned target for expanding irrigated area in 1958 is 92.21 million mu, and over 50% has been completed in less than three months.

Gansu, Shaanxi, and Anhui provinces have completed their original 1958 water conservancy construction tasks more than nine months ahead of schedule. By the end of December 1957, Gansu Province had expanded its irrigated area by 3.83 million mu, which is 109% of the annual plan for 1958. In the fifty days from the beginning of November to December 20, 1957, Shaanxi Province expanded its irrigated area by 3.2 million mu, which is 128% of the original 1958 plan, equivalent to 97.7% of the province's total irrigated area before liberation. This is a great leap forward in Shaanxi's water conservancy construction. As of December 26, Anhui Province had completed over 890 million cubic meters of earthwork, which is 111% of the original annual water conservancy task of 800 million cubic meters set by the Provincial Party Committee. The area of farmland drained and freed from waterlogging in this province has also reached over 10 million mu, equivalent to 102% of the annual plan. Some provinces with larger tasks have also recently seen rapid developments in water conservancy construction. For example, Henan Province has increased its irrigated area by 10 million mu, Hebei Province by 9 million mu, and Shandong Province by 5.1 million mu.

In the fervent water conservancy construction movement, peasants in many places, with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, are opening mountains, splitting ridges, and diverting water up mountains. Last winter, many peasants in mountainous and arid mountainous areas of Gansu Province demonstrated a heroic spirit in fighting drought, constructing canals on high mountains at altitudes of about 1,000 to 2,000 meters. More than 30 canals diverting water up mountains have appeared in the Tianshui Special District. The slogan put forward by leaders at all levels and the masses in this special district is: "Fight hard all year round, advance steadily and strike fiercely, and strive for water conservancy in the entire district in 1958." The Dingxi Special District, the driest in Gansu Province, has built and is building nine canals that can irrigate 10,000 to 200,000 mu. The farmers in this area are determined to fight drought, saying: "Stone is not harder than determination, and mountains are not higher than the soles of our feet." The members of the Third Agricultural Cooperative of Pipa Temple Township, Lueyang County, Shaanxi Province, carved an eight-li-long "Suspended Sky Dam" through three mountains on a cliff more than thirty feet above the ground to irrigate more than ninety mu of farmland. Members of the Hongwei Cooperative in Ningqiang County drilled a 300-foot-long stone mountain and built a "Mountain-Penetrating Dam" to irrigate more than 110 mu of farmland.

The current problems in water conservancy construction are that the phenomenon of slow action in individual areas has not been seriously reversed; a few areas do not pay enough attention to project quality and construction safety; and some areas do not grasp the work comprehensively, such as simply focusing on irrigation and neglecting drainage and water and soil conservation. These shortcomings need to be corrected in the next period of work. (Zhu Shuren)

### 全民水利运动势如排山倒海  三个月扩大灌溉面积四千多万亩，等于过去一年的总和

    全民水利运动势如排山倒海
    三个月扩大灌溉面积四千多万亩，等于过去一年的总和
    本报讯　全民性的水利建设运动，正以空前未有的速度向前跃进。从1957年10月初到12月下旬不及三个月的期间内，各地扩大的灌溉面积已达四千七百多万亩。
    这三个月扩大的灌溉面积，已经超过了1956年冬季到1957年秋收前的一年中扩大灌溉面积的总和，相当于1955年冬季第一次水利高潮时期完成数字的三倍以上。全国1958年扩大灌溉面积的计划指标九千二百二十一万亩，在不到三个月的期间里完成了50％以上。
    甘肃、陕西、安徽三个省已经提前九个多月完成了原定的1958年兴修水利的任务。甘肃省到1957年12月下旬，共扩大了灌溉面积三百八十三万亩，为1958年年计划的109％。陕西省从1957年11月初到12月20日的五十天中，就扩大了灌溉面积三百二十万亩，为原订1958年计划的128％，等于全省解放前总灌溉面积的97.7％。这是陕西省水利建设上的一次大跃进。安徽省到12月26日，已经完成土方八亿九千多万公方，为省委原订全年八亿公方水利任务的111％。这个省排水除涝的田地面积，也已达一千万亩以上，相当于年计划的102％。一些任务较大的省份，水利建设工作最近也都有了突飞猛进的发展。如河南省就增加了灌溉面积一千万亩，河北省增加了九百万亩，山东省增加了五百一十万亩。
    在热火朝天的水利建设运动中，许多地方的农民，以愚公移山的精神，开山劈岭，引水上山。去年冬天，甘肃省有不少山区和干旱山区的农民，表现了同干旱作斗争的英雄气概，把水渠兴修到了海拔一千公尺到二千公尺左右的高山上。天水专区已出现了三十多条引水上山的渠道。这个专区各级领导和群众提出的口号是：常年苦斗，稳扎猛打，争取1958年全区水利化。甘肃省最干旱的定西专区，已经兴修和正在兴修九条能灌溉一万到二十万亩的渠道，这个地区的农民同干旱作斗争的决心很大，他们说：“石头硬不过决心，山高高不过脚心”。陕西省略阳县琵琶寺乡第三农业社的社员，在离地三十多丈高的石崖上，开凿了通过三座大山的一条八里长的“悬天堰”灌田九十多亩。宁强县宏伟社的社员，钻了一条三百多尺长的石山，建成了“穿山堰”，灌田一百一十多亩。
    当前水利建设的问题，是个别地区行动迟缓的现象还没有认真扭转；少数地区对工程质量和施工安全注意不够；有些地区工作抓的不全面，如单纯抓了灌溉，忽视了除涝和水土保持。这些缺点都需要在今后一段工作中注意纠正。　（朱树人）
