    The 59-Year-Old County Head
    Ma Rubao
    In Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, as soon as County Head He Wenlong is mentioned, people will talk endlessly about many moving stories about him.
  Familiar with Every Place, Understands Every Cadre
    Throughout the county, he has traveled to most of the townships. He can recite the names of every village and every river, and is familiar with the geographical environment and climate conditions of each village. He knows which paddy field and which piece of land is suitable for planting which kind of crops, and which kind of cultivation method is suitable. He knows that a certain place needs to be drought-resistant, how many ponds and reservoirs need to be dug; a certain place needs to be flood-resistant, how many rivers need to be dredged and how many ditches need to be opened. As for the masses, he is even more familiar with them. He can remember the names of countless commune members and cadres, understand their families, living conditions, and even tell their personalities and specialties.
    It was in December 1956 when He Wenlong went to work in his hometown, Hejiashantou. He was stopped by the villagers on the way. They "complained" to him, saying: The cooperative is now only run by young cadres, and the old folks are being left aside. However, when he arrived at the cooperative, the cooperative cadres said: The old folks are backward and only know how to pick on the faults in the cadres' work. What was going on? He Wenlong asked the cooperative cadres to invite a few old farmers they considered the most backward to hold a discussion and listen to their opinions. That night, they originally only planned to invite ten or so people, but when the news spread, nearly a hundred old farmers came and raised many opinions. Some blamed the cooperative for not cherishing farm tools; some questioned the cooperative for delaying the announcement of the final accounts; and some criticized the cooperative cadres for being dictatorial and not listening to the experience of the elderly, etc. After listening to these opinions, He Wenlong smiled and said to the cadres: "You see, the opinions of the old folks all make some sense, don't they?" He analyzed these opinions one by one on the spot, and if they were correct or could be improved, he asked the cadres to correct them immediately; he also patiently explained the opinions that were not correct enough. For some opinions, he said: This is the fault of the county, and he should apologize to everyone. This made the old folks satisfied, and the cadres also consciously checked the shortcomings in their work.
    Later, He Wenlong passed through this township again. The old folks said: "The cadres are much easier to talk to." The cadres also said: "The old folks are more active."
    Charging Ahead in Difficulties, Taking the Lead in Suffering
    Water conservancy is the "lifeline" of the people of Zhuji County. For many years, the people of Zhuji County have suffered from drought and flood disasters. From 1034 AD to 1954, there were 91 extraordinarily large floods in 920 years, and ordinary floods occurred every year. He Wenlong is a local, and he has personally experienced these tragic lives. Therefore, he attaches great importance to the county's water conservancy work. For all major water conservancy projects, from surveying to completion, there is no place where he has not personally participated or directed.
    In the spring of 1954, the Jiangxi Lake Canal cutoff project began. At that time, it was the coldest time of the year, and the ice on the river was several inches thick. The migrant workers were so frozen that they huddled up and dared not go to work. If the enthusiasm of the migrant workers was not boosted, the completion date of the project would be delayed, affecting the spring plowing. After He Wenlong explained these reasons to the cadres, he and his brother, the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, He Wenguang, took the lead in jumping into the bone-chilling river to break the ice and dig the soil. When the masses saw the county head going into the water himself, they all jumped into the water with doubled spirit. During the construction of the Dongbai Canal, the migrant workers' lives were very difficult, and they could only drink a few bowls of thin porridge a day. In this situation, some people were discouraged. He Wenlong personally went to the migrant workers' dormitory to visit them, encourage them, and carry soil with the migrant workers. Sometimes he was still checking the work back and forth on the construction site at two or three o'clock in the middle of the night. Under his influence, none of the cadres participating in the canal project did not participate in carrying soil. Everyone's enthusiasm was quickly boosted.
        A Student and a Teacher
    Going to the masses to investigate and research, and following the mass line is the working method that He Wenlong has always adhered to. When carrying out any work, whenever he feels that he is not familiar with or has no confidence in a problem, he always humbly learns from the masses and asks for advice. Every time he returns from the countryside, his notebook is often densely filled with various situations, figures, and the masses' slang. His pockets are often stuffed with many kinds of diseased crops and specimens. Now, this county head, who came from a peasant family and has not even graduated from elementary school, can not only talk very congenially with the local old farmers, but also discuss various water conservancy technical issues with agricultural water conservancy technicians.
    One day in the winter of 1955, He Wenlong went to the Zhugong Lake construction site to check on the work. At that time, they were preparing to build a 4,000-meter-long canal there, and they were also planning to excavate and fill more than 70,000 cubic meters of earth to build a sluice gate, which would cost more than 70,000 yuan. He Wenlong calculated that, according to this plan, not only would many migrant workers have to be mobilized, but where would so much money come from? Did they have to build this gate? So he walked along the line, and the more he walked, the more he felt that it was not cost-effective to build such a large sluice gate for such a canal. So he decided to invite a few farmers and designers to conduct an on-site survey of the geological conditions there.
    They walked east along the Zhibu Station, and He Wenlong carefully observed the surrounding terrain as he walked. When they came to the Zangma Ridge, He Wenlong suddenly seemed to have discovered a new problem. He asked the people next to him and learned that the back of this mountain ridge was the Pujiang River. They opened the design drawing and saw that they were going to build a large gate along the edge of this mountain ridge more than 1,000 meters north to divert water to the Pujiang River. He Wenlong thought: If the line passes through this mountain ridge, then wouldn't it be unnecessary to build a large gate at all? And the route of the canal can also be shortened a lot. But someone pointed out that there was danger in digging tunnels, the technology was very strong, and it was easy to have accidents. He Wenlong thought: Success depends on human effort. There will always be difficulties in doing any work. The problem lies in the enthusiasm. Technical problems can be completely solved among the masses. So, he went to invite experienced mountain stone masons to discuss it together, and invited veterans who had experience in digging tunnels from North Korea to help with the tunnel work.
    Soon, with the active support of the masses, the tunnel project finally started. During the construction process, He Wenlong squatted on the construction site almost all day long, helping the migrant workers solve this or that specific problem. It took several months of hard work for the project to be completed smoothly. According to this line, the project cost more than 30,000 yuan less than the original design line, used 50,000 cubic meters less of earthwork, and also lost 300 acres less of paddy fields.
    Comrade He Wenlong joined the revolution in 1929 and has held many important positions. Under the leadership of the Party organization, he waged a strong struggle against the enemy. After being arrested by the enemy in 1930, he was unyielding under the enemy's torture and lived in prison for nearly seven years. However, the people of Zhuji County especially respect and trust him, not entirely because of his early revolutionary experience, but because of his tenacious revolutionary spirit, hard work and simple living, close ties with the masses, and the excellent work style of sharing weal and woe with the masses that he has maintained for 28 years. He is already 59 years old this year and also suffers from chronic appendicitis. In order to take care of his health, the county party committee wanted him to take a vacation, but he refused; the county party committee was not at ease when he went to the countryside alone, and wanted to assign him a communicator, but he did not want it either. All he wants is more work!

    五十九岁的老县长
    马如宝
    在浙江省诸暨县，只要一提起县长何文隆来，人们就会滔滔不绝地告诉你许多关于他的动人事例。
  熟悉每个地方　了解每个干部
    在全县，他跑遍了绝大部分的乡。他能背得出每个村落和每条河流的名字，熟悉每个村子的地理环境、气候情况。他知道那个畈那一片地适合种那种庄稼，适合采用那种耕作方法。那个地方要抗旱，需要挖几个塘，筑几个水库；那个地方要防涝，要掘几条河，开几条沟。至于群众，他就更熟悉了。他能够记得数不清的社员和干部的姓名，了解他们的家庭、生活情况，甚至说得出他们的性格和特长。
    是1956年12月的时候，何文隆到自己的家乡——何家山头去工作。路上就被老乡们拖住了。他们向他“诉苦”说：社里现在只是青年干部做市面，老头子被丢在一边。可是，当他一到社里，社干部们却说：老头子落后，光会挑剔干部工作中有毛病。这到底是怎么回事呢？何文隆就叫社干部去请几位他们认为最落后的老农民来开个座谈会，听听他们的意见。那天晚上，本来只打算请十来个人，可是消息传开后，竟来了近百来个老农民，提出了很多意见。有的怪合作社不爱惜农具；有的对社里决算迟迟不公布提出了责问；也有的批评社干部做事专断，不听老年人的经验等等。何文隆听了这些意见后，笑着对干部说：“你们看，老头们的意见都带着几分理呢？”他当场把这些意见逐条地分析了一下，正确的，可以改进的，让干部们马上改正；不够正确的意见也耐心作了解释。有的意见，他说：这是县里的不是，他应该向大家做检讨。这一来，老头们满意了，干部们也都自觉地检查了工作中的缺点。
    以后，何文隆又经过这个乡。老头们说：“干部好商量得多了。”干部们也说：“老头们更积极了”。
    遇难打冲锋　吃苦在前头
    水利是诸暨县群众的“命根子”。多少年来，诸暨县人民吃尽了旱、涝灾害的苦头。从公元1034年起到1954年，九百二十年中共发生过特大洪水九十一次，至于一般洪水年年都有。何文隆是当地人，这些悲惨的生活他都亲身经历过。因此，他对全县的水利工作非常重视。凡是较大的水利工程，从勘察到完工，没有一处不是他亲自参加或指挥的。
    1954年春，江西湖渠道截湾工程开工。当时正是天气最冷的时候，河水结的冰冻足足有几寸厚，民工们都冻得紧缩着身子不敢出工。如果不把民工们的劲头鼓起来，工程的完工期限就要推迟，影响春耕。何文隆在向干部们讲清了这些道理后，就和他的弟弟、水利局长何文广带头跳入刺骨的河水里破冰掘土，群众看到县长亲自下水，也都精神百倍地跳下水去。在修建东白渠道时，民工生活十分艰难，一天只能喝几碗薄粥汤，在这种情况下有些人气馁了。何文隆亲自到民工宿舍去访问，鼓励他们，并和民工们一起挑土，有时到深夜二、三点钟，他还在工地上来回检查工作。在他的影响下，所有参加渠道工程工作的干部没有一个不参加挑土的。大家的劲头迅速鼓起来了。
        是学生　也是老师
    到群众中去调查研究，走群众路线，这是何文隆一贯坚持的工作方法。他在进行任何工作时，凡是自己认为不熟悉或没有把握的问题，总是虚心地向群众学习，请教。他每次下乡回来，笔记本里常常密密麻麻地记满了各种情况、数字、群众的俗语。口袋里常常塞满了许多种发病的作物和标本。现在这个农民出身、连小学也没有毕业的县长，不仅能够和当地的老农民谈得十分投机，而且能够和农业水利技术人员商讨各种水利技术问题了。
    1955年冬的一天，何文隆到朱公湖一带工地上去检查工作。当时在这里正准备修建一条长达四千公尺的渠道，还准备挖、填七万多土方修建一座水闸，要花七万多元钱，何文隆计算了一下，按照这个计划，不但要动员很多民工，而且这许多钱哪里来呀？难道非要造这个闸不行吗？于是他沿着线路走，越走越觉得这么一条渠道，修建这样大工程的水闸是不合算的。于是他决定邀请几个农民和设计人员一起去实地勘察那里的地质情况。
    他们沿着直埠车站往东走去，何文隆一边走，一边仔细地注意着周围的地形。当他们走到葬马岭的时候，何文隆忽然好像发现了一个什么新的问题，他问了问旁边的人，知道这座山岭的背面就是浦阳江。他们翻开设计图一看，原来就是要沿着这座山岭边缘往北一千多公尺的地方造一个大闸，把水引到浦阳江去。何文隆想：如果线路就穿着这座山岭过去，那末不就根本用不着造大闸了吗？并且渠道的线路也可缩短很多。可是有人提出打山洞有危险，技术性很强，很容易出事故。何文隆想：事在人为，做任何工作总会是有困难的，问题就在于劲头。技术问题在群众中是完全可以解决的。于是，他又去请了有经验的开山石匠一起来讨论，并邀请了从朝鲜回来对打山洞有经验的志愿军战士一起来帮助打洞工作。
    不久，在群众的积极支持下，开洞工程终于动工了。在施工过程中，何文隆差不多整天蹲在工地上，帮助民工们解决这个或那个具体问题，整整地忙了几个月，工程才顺利完工。按照这条线路修建，比原来设计的工程线路节省了三万多元资金，少用了五万方土方，还少损失了三百亩稻田。
    何文隆同志是1929年参加革命的，担任过许多重要的职务。在党组织的领导下，他和敌人进行了坚强的斗争。1930年被敌人逮捕后，在敌人严刑威迫下坚强不屈，过了将近七年的监狱生活。但是诸暨县人民特别尊重和信任他，并不完全是因为他早年的革命经历，而是他二十八年来一直保持着的顽强的革命精神，艰苦朴素，密切联系群众，和群众同甘共苦的优良作风。他今年已经五十九岁了，还患有慢性盲肠炎。县委为了照顾他的身体，曾要他去休养，他不肯；他一个人下乡，县委也不放心，要给他配一个通讯员，他也不要。他要的只是多给他一些工作！
