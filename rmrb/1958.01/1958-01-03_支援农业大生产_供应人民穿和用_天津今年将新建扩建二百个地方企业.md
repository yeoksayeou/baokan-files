Supporting Large-Scale Agricultural Production and Supplying the People with Clothing and Goods
Tianjin to Build and Expand 200 Local Enterprises This Year

(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Tianjin Daily, Tianjin's local industries will build and expand many factories this year, with a total of 200 basic construction projects. Among these, five are above the designated limit, and twenty have investments exceeding one million yuan. The investment amount is equivalent to the total of the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan, and nearly doubles that of 1957, the year with the largest basic construction tasks.

Based on the needs of the country and Tianjin's advantageous conditions, such as its proximity to the Bohai Sea, rich chemical industry resources, and a certain level of technical expertise, Tianjin's local industries will focus on developing the chemical industry this year, which will promote agricultural production increases and solve the people's clothing and food problems. This year, nineteen major chemical factories will be newly built or expanded, including a sulfuric acid plant with an annual output of 40,000 tons, an organic synthesis plant, a formaldehyde plant, a medium-sized Vinylon pilot plant, a modern chemical plant producing celluloid and processing polyvinyl chloride products, and Dye Chemical Plant No. 5, which produces dye intermediates. Construction of the sulfuric acid plant will begin this year and is expected to be officially put into production in early 1960. The sulfuric acid produced by this plant can supply the needs of the chemical, textile, printing and dyeing, and metallurgical industries in Tianjin and nearby industrial cities. The organic synthesis plant and Factory 413 will be completed this year, producing five organic synthesis products: oxalic acid, chlorosulfonic acid, formaldehyde, carbolic acid, and salicylic acid. These products are important raw materials for manufacturing dyes, medicines, plastics, and synthetic fibers.

In order to supply the needs of industrial production, Tianjin will further expand the production of raw material industries this year. In addition to a large part of the aforementioned chemical industry being raw material industries, some steel plants, refractory material plants, and pulp mills will also be newly built and expanded. The newly built thin plate workshop and welded steel pipe workshop this year will produce thin plates and welded steel pipes for machine manufacturing and other industries. The pulp mill, which can be basically completed this year, will use waste shoe soles and other materials to produce pulp, replacing wood pulp to manufacture various high-grade papers.

Supporting agricultural production and achieving the tasks stipulated in the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Development Program is an important direction for Tianjin's industrial production. This year, a workshop will be expanded in the First Pesticide Factory to produce 1059 pesticide. This pesticide is suitable for cotton fields, paddy fields, and orchards. After being sprayed on plants, it will be absorbed and dispersed throughout the plant, not only preventing pests but also promoting plant growth. Tianjin No. 3 Rubber Factory and Jingu Rubber Factory will also add some equipment this year, which can increase the production of approximately 500,000 handcart tires to support the needs of farmland water conservancy construction.

Tianjin will also build and expand some factories that produce high-grade, precision, and complex products. The Tianjin Watch Factory will begin construction this year, and after completion, it can produce 240,000 seventeen-jewel waterproof watches annually. China's first modern cellophane factory will also be completed this year and put into production in 1959. Construction of a cashmere factory will also begin this year. Cashmere is softer and warmer than wool, and people call it the "king of wool."

When expanding and building new factories, Tianjin's local industries will fully utilize existing buildings and equipment, strictly reduce the proportion of non-production equipment in the overall basic construction, and strive for small investments and large returns, in accordance with the principles of diligence and thrift in building the country and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This year, Tianjin's five factories producing wire and round nails will only spend more than 540,000 yuan to balance their equipment, plus tapping potential, and they will be able to increase production by 7,400 tons of wire and round nails throughout the year, recovering the entire investment within three months. This year, Renli Woolen Textile Factory will invest 770,000 yuan to add some equipment, which will increase the annual production of fine worsted fabrics such as wool gabardine by 320,000 meters, saving 1 million yuan in investment compared to building a new factory that produces 320,000 meters of fine worsted fabrics annually.

    支援农业大生产　供应人民穿和用
    天津今年将新建扩建二百个地方企业
    本报讯　据天津日报报道：天津市地方工业今年将兴建和扩建许多工厂，基本建设项目共有二百个，其中限额以上的有五个，投资一百万元以上的有二十个。投资额相当于第一个五年计划头四年的总和，同基本建设任务最大的1957年相比，增加了近一倍。
    根据全国的需要和天津市地近渤海、化学工业资源丰富和有一定技术力量等有利条件，今年天津市地方工业，将着重发展有关促进农业增产和解决人民吃穿问题的化学工业。今年将新建、扩建十九个主要化学工厂，包括年产四万吨的硫酸厂、有机合成厂、?醛厂、维尼龙中型试制厂、生产赛璐珞和加工聚氯乙烯产品的近代化学厂、生产染料中间体的染化五厂等。硫酸厂今年开始建设，预计在1960年初正式投入生产，这个厂生产的硫酸可以供应天津和附近工业城市的化学、纺织、印染、冶金工业等的需要。有机合成厂和413工厂今年即可建成，将生产草酸、氯磺酸、甲醛、石炭酸、水扬酸等五种有机合成产品，这些产品是制造染料、医药、塑料、合成纤维等的重要原料。
    为了供应工业生产的需要，今年天津市将进一步扩大原料工业的生产。除了上述的化学工业中有一大部分是原料工业外，还要新建和扩建一些钢铁厂、耐火材料厂和纸浆厂。今年新建的薄板车间和有缝钢管车间将生产薄板和有缝钢管，供给机器制造及其他工业使用；今年基本上可以建成的纸浆厂，将利用破鞋底等生产纸浆，代替木浆制造各种高级纸张。
    支援农业生产，实现农业发展纲要四十条规定的任务，是天津市工业生产的重要方向。今年要在第一农药厂扩建一个生产1059农药的车间。这种农药适用于棉田、稻田和果木园，把这种农药喷洒到植物上以后，就会被吸收，分散到植物的全部，不但可以防治虫害，而且可以促进植物生长。天津市第三橡胶厂和津沽橡胶厂，今年也将增加一部分设备，约可增产五十万条手推车轮胎，支援农田水利建设的需要。
    天津市还将新建、扩建一些生产高级、精密、复杂的产品的工厂。天津市手表厂今年将开工兴建，全部建成后，每年可以生产二十四万只十七钻防水手表。我国第一个近代化的玻璃纸厂也将在今年完工，1959年投入生产。今年还将动工兴建山羊绒厂，山羊绒比羊毛还要柔软、暖和，人们称它为“毛中之王”。
    天津市地方工业在扩建、新建工厂时，根据勤俭建国和多快好省的方针，将充分利用原有的房屋和设备，切实减少非生产设备在整个基本建设中的比重，力求投资小、收效大。天津市五个生产铅丝、元钉的工厂，今年只花五十四万多元平衡一下设备，加上挖掘潜力，全年就能增产七千四百吨铅丝、元钉，在三个月内收回全部投资。仁立毛呢纺织厂今年以七十七万元的投资，增加部分设备，每年就能增产三十二万公尺的毛哔叽等精纺织品，比新建一个年产三十二万公尺精纺织品的工厂，要节省一百万元的投资。
