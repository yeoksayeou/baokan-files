The first batch of gifts was transported to Hanoi on the 11th by a special plane sent by a delegation from the Democratic German Radio.

More than 1,400 people, including representatives of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Youth League, the Women's Federation, the Fatherland Front, and the Vietnam Radio, as well as children, attended today's gift-giving ceremony. The chairman of the Vietnamese Committee for Receiving and Distributing Gifts from German Youths and representatives of the Vietnamese Young Pioneers expressed their deep gratitude at the ceremony for the friendship of German youths and the government of the German Democratic Republic.

The delegation of the Democratic German Radio is scheduled to travel to Haiphong, Nam Dinh, Thai Nguyen and other cities on the 13th to hold gift-giving ceremonies and convey the warm greetings of the German youths to the Vietnamese youths.
