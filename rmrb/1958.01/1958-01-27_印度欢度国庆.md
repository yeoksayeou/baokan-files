    印度欢度国庆
    新华社新德里26日电　今天印度全国欢庆印度共和国成立八周年。
    今天上午，德里被装饰得非常华丽，呈现一片节日气象。印度总统普拉沙德检阅了一年一度的国庆游行。
    坐在特地建造的检阅台两边的有：副总统拉达克里希南、总理尼赫鲁等。在印度访问的中国军事友好代表团团长叶剑英元帅作为国宾同他们坐在一起。出席观礼的还有内阁部长、国会议员和各国外交使节。中国军事友好代表团和中国水利考察团的全体成员也都出席观礼。
    受检阅的队伍中有重型坦克、大炮、机械化部队、富于色彩的骑兵和骆驼兵部队。高速度的喷气飞机最后出现，它们飞临总统的检阅台时都低飞致敬。
    在武装部队以后，首先是大象，接着是来自各邦的载有表演者的花车，表现出人民的不同的生活和进步的情况。
    昨天晚上，普拉沙德总统在向全国广播的时候再度强调印度的和平政策。他说：“我们主张和平和互不侵犯——我们相信可以通过共处的原则达到这种目的。”他号召人民加倍努力，成功地执行争取印度的经济进步的第二个五年计划。
    今天下午，普拉沙德总统在总统府举行国庆日招待会。以叶剑英元帅为首的中国军事友好代表团参加了招待会。
