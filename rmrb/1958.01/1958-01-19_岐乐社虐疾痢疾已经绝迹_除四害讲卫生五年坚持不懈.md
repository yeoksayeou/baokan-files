Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 18th: Many regions in Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces have recently sent people to Qile Cooperative in Lechang County, Guangdong, to learn from their experience in leading cooperative members in "eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene" for five years. Qile Cooperative has now basically eliminated flies, mosquitoes, and sparrows. Rats have also been greatly reduced compared to the past. Malaria and dysentery, which used to be prevalent every year, have now been eradicated. Among the 132 cooperative member households in the entire cooperative, many hygiene habits have been universally adopted, such as separating humans and livestock, covering toilets, having spittoons in every household, using serving chopsticks in every household, having face towels for everyone, using toothbrushes for everyone, and regularly cleaning indoors and outdoors, etc.

"Constant education and hands-on participation" is the most important experience of Qile Cooperative in making "eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene" a regular practice. The party branch secretary, party members, and other cooperative cadres often take the lead in production and hygiene while using good and bad examples to educate cooperative members. Pan Jinfang, a cooperative member, was initially unwilling to separate humans and livestock, did not have a spittoon at home, and even refused to clean the environment when it was his turn. Pan Baosheng often went to Jinfang's home to patiently educate him, helped him sweep the floor, and helped him calculate the costs of illness, pointing out that his family's three generations of lung disease were due to poor hygiene. At this time, Jinfang wanted to separate humans and livestock, but he had difficulties in terms of labor. Baosheng immediately took several cadres to help him move the livestock shed. This incident made Jinfang more active in all aspects of hygiene work afterwards.

The Party branch and cooperative committee adhered to the leadership method of "relying on the advanced to lead the backward," and gradually improved and consolidated the cooperative's hygiene work. Hygiene activists in Qile Cooperative formed a propaganda team, regularly using loudspeakers, blackboards, big-character posters, pictures, slogans, and folk songs to publicize hygiene knowledge and conduct commendations and criticisms. The cooperative conducts mass hygiene work summaries and evaluations every year, selecting a group of personal hygiene models and model hygiene families. The cadres of Qile Cooperative, while doing and publicizing, always grasped the key point of "integrating hygiene and production closely." In response to the concerns of some cadres and cooperative members that hygiene work would hinder production, the Party branch focused on publicizing examples of how doing a good job in hygiene reduces illness, which can increase production in the cooperative and increase income for cooperative members. From the Party branch and cooperative committee to production teams and production groups, hygiene work plans are included when formulating production plans and work plans. After the Party branch discovered that some cooperative members only focused on production and neglected hygiene work, it immediately led the cooperative members to launch a debate and make comprehensive arrangements. In addition to participating in productive labor like male cooperative members, female cooperative members also have to bear household labor, which affects their enthusiasm for doing a good job in hygiene. After the Party branch organized a debate, cooperative cadres took the lead in mobilizing male cooperative members to change the old habit of not taking care of housework, so that every household insisted on hygiene and cleanliness work. Due to the good hygiene, the attendance rate of cooperative members has been maintained at over 98% in the past three years, and the cooperative has increased production every year.

"Gradually promote, consolidate item by item, and gradually improve" is the most effective way for Qile Cooperative to comprehensively adhere to various hygiene systems. Every time the cooperative carries out a sudden hygiene campaign, it immediately establishes a system to consolidate it. At first, the cadres were eager to promote the various systems of "four cleanliness and five exterminations" all at once, but the masses could not accept it. Later, according to the acceptance level and economic conditions of the masses, they first carried out indoor and outdoor environmental cleaning, and then carried out regular cleaning and hygiene duty systems. After the environmental hygiene system was consolidated, personal hygiene and family hygiene were promoted, and further improvements were made to toilets, wells, and separation of humans and livestock, which made every cooperative member willing to implement it.

    岐乐社虐疾痢疾已经绝迹
    除四害讲卫生五年坚持不懈
    据新华社广州18日电　江西省和广东许多地区最近都曾派人到广东乐昌县岐乐社学习这个社领导社员五年坚持“除四害、讲卫生”的经验。岐乐社现在已经基本消灭了苍蝇、蚊子、麻雀。老鼠也比以前大大减少。过去这里年年流行的虐疾、痢疾已经绝迹了。在全社一百三十二户社员中已普遍养成了许多卫生习惯，如人畜分居、厕所加盖和家家设痰盂、户户用公筷、人人有面巾、个个用牙刷、经常打扫室内外，等等。
    “经常教育、亲自动手”。这是岐乐社使“除四害、讲卫生”经常化的最重要经验。社里的党支部书记、党员和其他社干部就是经常一面带头搞生产、搞卫生，一面用讲卫生的好坏典型教育社员。社员潘金芳起初不愿实行人畜分居，家里不设痰盂，甚至轮到他打扫环境卫生也不干。潘保生便常常到金芳家里耐心教育他，动手帮他扫地板，还针对潘金芳患肺病的痛苦，帮助他算病害账，使金芳认识到自己家里三代肺病相传是由于不讲卫生。这时金芳想实行人畜分居，但在劳动力方面又有困难。保生立刻带了几个干部帮他搬迁畜舍。这件事情，使金芳以后对各项卫生工作都变得积极起来。
    党支部、社委会坚持了“依靠先进，带动落后”的领导方法，逐步地提高和巩固了全社的卫生工作。岐乐社的卫生工作积极分子组成了一支宣传队伍，经常用广播筒、黑板报、大字报、图画、标语和唱山歌来宣传卫生常识，并进行表扬和批评。社里每年都进行群众性的卫生工作总结和评比，选出一批个人卫生模范和卫生模范家庭。岐乐社的干部在边做边宣传中，始终抓住“卫生、生产紧结合”这个关键。党支部针对部分干部社员怕搞卫生会妨碍生产的顾虑，着重宣传了搞好卫生少害病，可使社里增加生产、社员增加收入的事例。从党支部、社委会直到生产队、生产组，在制订生产规划和作业计划时，都把卫生工作计划进去。党支部在发现部分社员只顾生产，忽视卫生工作以后，便立即领导社员们展开辩论，作出全面安排。女社员除了跟男社员一样参加生产劳动外，还要担负家务劳动，这就影响了她们搞好卫生的积极性。经过党支部组织辩论以后，社干部便带头发动男社员改变不管家务的旧习惯，才使家家户户坚持了卫生清洁工作。由于搞好了卫生，这个社近三年来社员出勤率经常保持在98％以上，社里年年都增产。
    “逐步推行、逐项巩固、逐渐提高”。这是岐乐社全面坚持各项卫生制度最有效的办法。社里每次举行一项突击性的卫生工作，紧接着就建立制度把它巩固下来。干部最初急于一下子推行“四净五灭”的各种制度，但群众接受不了。后来根据群众的接受程度和经济条件，先搞室内外环境清洁，再搞定期大扫除和卫生轮值制。环境卫生制度巩固后，才推行个人卫生和家庭卫生，进一步又搞改良厕所、水井、人畜分居等，这就使每个社员都乐意执行。
