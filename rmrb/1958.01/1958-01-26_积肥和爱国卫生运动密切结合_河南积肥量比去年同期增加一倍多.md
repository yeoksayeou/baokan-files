Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 24th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Qu Mingzhen reported): Henan Province now mobilizes more than 5.15 million people daily to participate in the manure collection campaign. The province's original plan to collect 664.5 billion jin of manure in 1958 has been more than 92% completed after two and a half months of efforts by farmers. The actual amount of manure collected has more than doubled compared to the same period last year.

This year's manure collection campaign in Henan Province is closely integrated with the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the "Four Pests", and is large in scale and has many avenues. The main content of manure collection is to increase the accumulation of animal manure, human excrement, grass ash, and the accumulation and production of green manure and miscellaneous manure. Farmers in the Xinyang, Nanyang, Xuchang, and Anyang special districts used to raise pigs without pigsties, and did not pay attention to collecting the manure of livestock and poultry, discarding it at will. Through the manure collection campaign of last winter and this spring, this situation has been changed. In just over two months, 465.2 billion jin of manure have been collected. The Luoyang Special District attaches particular importance to raising pigs and collecting manure. In recent months, more than 200,000 pigs have been added, and 100,268 pigsties have been built. The number of pigs penned in the entire special district has increased from 30% in the third quarter of last year to 90%. In addition to paying attention to digging sludge and planting and pressing green manure, the Shangqiu and Kaifeng areas have also universally promoted the experience of Zhang Benzi from Mengjin County in the western Henan mountainous area, who created tile-urn style thatched ponds and thatched wells to widely collect human excrement and sewage, and utilize weeds, fallen leaves, and stalks to compost large amounts of fertilizer, with good results. The excrement and garbage in towns and cities, which had always been neglected throughout the province, have been collected and transported to rural areas since the launch of the "Four Pests" elimination and hygiene campaign last December. Government agencies, schools, enterprises, and citizens in nine cities under the province, including Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, have formed a system of clearing excrement and cleaning up garbage around their residences. Each town has also established a specialized management organization, responsible for linking up with nearby agricultural cooperatives to directly transport excrement and other miscellaneous fertilizers to the countryside to support agricultural production.

Another characteristic of manure collection in various places is that it is applied to the land as it is collected. This plays a good role in promoting the healthy growth of wheat and enhancing the fertility of idle fields. It is understood that nearly 50 million mu of wheat fields in the province have been top-dressed, exceeding the area of winter wheat top-dressing in 1956 by 1.25 times. According to the revised manure collection plan for 1958 recently issued by the Provincial People's Committee, by the end of March, manure collection in various places will reach 1 trillion jin. In this way, the province's more than 70 million mu of wheat can be guaranteed to be universally top-dressed three times before maturity. The amount of fertilizer applied to other spring crops and replanted farmland can also be increased from an average of 3,000 to 4,000 jin in previous years to about 9,000 jin.

### 积肥和爱国卫生运动密切结合  河南积肥量比去年同期增加一倍多

    积肥和爱国卫生运动密切结合
    河南积肥量比去年同期增加一倍多
    新华社郑州24日电　新华社记者曲明振报道：河南省现在每天要出动五百一十五万多人参加积肥运动。全省原来制订的1958年积肥六千六百四十五亿斤的计划，经过农民两个半月的努力，已完成了92％以上。实际积肥量比上年同期增加一倍多。
    今年河南省的积肥运动是密切结合以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动进行的，规模大、门路也很多。积肥的主要内容是增积畜肥、人粪尿、草木灰和积制绿肥、杂肥等。信阳、南阳、许昌、安阳专区农民过去养猪不圈猪，对耕畜、家禽的粪便也不注意收拾，随便丢掉。经过去冬今春的积肥运动，已经改变了这一状况，短短两个多月就积肥四千六百五十二亿斤。洛阳专区特别重视养猪积肥。最近几个月共增添生猪二十多万头，并且打猪圈十万零二千六百八十个。全专区上圈的猪从去年第三季度的30％上升到90％。商丘、开封地区除了注意挖污泥、种植和压制绿肥外，还普遍推广了豫西山区孟津县张本资创造的修瓦瓮式茅池、茅井，广积人粪尿、污水，并利用杂草、落叶、秸秆等大量沤制堆肥的经验，成效很好。过去全省一向被忽略的城镇的粪便、垃圾，从去年12月开展除四害、讲卫生运动以来，也都注意收集运往农村。郑州、开封等九个省辖市的机关、学校、企业和市民，已经形成清除粪便和打扫住宅周围垃圾的制度。各城镇还成立了专门管理机构，负责同附近农业社挂钩，把粪便和其他杂肥直接运下乡，支援农业生产。
    各地积肥的另一个特点是随积随上地。这对促使小麦健壮、增强休闲田的地力起到良好作用。据了解，目前全省已有近五千万亩麦田施了追肥，超过了1956年冬季麦田追肥面积一点二五倍。根据省人民委员会最近修订的1958年积肥计划，到3月底，各地积肥将达到一万亿斤。这样，全省七千多万亩小麦在成熟之前就可保证普遍施追肥三次。其它春作物和复播农田的施肥量，也可以由往年平均施肥三、四千斤增加到九千斤左右。
