Not long ago, I visited various new Soviet passenger planes at the Vnukovo Airport near Moscow. There, the "Tu-114," "Tu-104A," "Ukraine," "Moscow," "Mi-6" helicopters, and other new passenger planes were parked, among which the "Tu-114" was the most eye-catching. Its huge silver-white body appeared more magnificent and majestic than any other aircraft.

The "Tu-114" is the world's largest long-range, high-speed passenger plane. Its appearance is very similar to the "Tu-104" jet passenger plane, but its fuselage is longer than the "Tu-104," and it uses four huge turboprop engines. Although its speed is slightly lower than the "Tu-104," it has a large passenger capacity, flies farther, and has lower operating costs. Its ticket price is only equal to the train fare for the same distance.

The "Tu-114" can fly non-stop from Moscow to New York, Beijing, Vladivostok, Yangon, or Tokyo. The standard "Tu-114" can carry 170 people; the version for intercontinental flights can carry 120 people, all with sleeper berths; and the version for routes from Moscow to Tbilisi, Sverdlovsk, or Riga can carry 220 people.

We visited the "Tu-114" passenger plane that can carry 170 people. After boarding the upper level of the plane, we found the chief designer of the aircraft, Tupolev, waiting for us in the cabin. He shook hands with each visitor with a smile. Afterwards, he asked his assistant to introduce the performance of the aircraft to everyone and guided everyone on the tour.

The first cabin near the plane's entrance can accommodate 41 passengers, with seven rows of very soft sofa chairs, which can be pulled open and turned into reclining chairs for sleeping. Behind it is the second cabin, which is a restaurant type, with 48 seats, with a rectangular table in front of every two rows of facing seats. Next to the second cabin is the commissary, where the flight attendants are located. Passing through the commissary and walking further back, there are two single cabins with three seats each, followed by four small sleeping compartments that can sleep three people. Behind the small sleeping compartments is a large cabin that can accommodate 54 people. At the rear of the plane are the cloakroom and washroom.

The lower level of the plane is used to store luggage, goods, and mail, and the kitchen is also located here. When it's mealtime, the flight attendant makes a phone call to the chef, and two automatic small elevators transport the food upstairs.

The design of the "Tu-114" takes into account the comfort of passengers. Each cabin has good soundproofing and insulation equipment, so even when the plane rises to an altitude of 10,000 meters or even 12,000 meters, it still feels like being in a comfortable room.

We walked out from the rear exit of the plane. Everyone cast a final glance at this silver giant bird with excitement.

The "Tu-114" has not yet officially started operating after its test flights. Soon, it will visit major cities around the world. (Attached picture)

### 参观苏联“图—114”客机

    参观苏联“图—114”客机
      新华社驻莫斯科记者　李克
    不久以前，记者在莫斯科近郊的伏努科夫飞机场参观了苏联的各种新式客机。那里停着“图—114”、“图—104A”、“乌克兰”、“莫斯科”、“米—6”直升飞机等新式客机，其中“图—114”最引人注意，它的庞大的银白色身躯比任何一架飞机都显得更为壮观和雄伟。
      “图—114”是世界上最大的远程快速客机。它的外形和“图—104”喷气客机很相似，不过它的机身比“图—104”长，而且采用四部巨大的涡轮螺旋桨发动机。它的时速虽然比“图—104”稍小，但是载客量大，飞得远，飞行成本低，它的票价仅等于同样里程的火车票价。
    “图—114”可以不着陆从莫斯科飞到纽约、北京、海参崴、仰光或者东京。普通型的“图—114”可以载一百七十人；供洲际飞行用的可以载一百二十人，全是卧铺席位；供从莫斯科到第比利斯、斯维德洛夫斯克或里加这样的航线上用的可载二百二十人。
    我们参观的是可以载一百七十人的“图—114”客机。登上了飞机的上层，我们发现飞机总设计师图波列夫在机舱里等候着我们。他含着笑同每一个参观者握手。之后，他请自己的助手向大家介绍飞机的性能，并引导大家参观。
    靠飞机进口处的第一客舱可以容纳四十一名乘客，有七排很柔软的沙发椅，睡觉时可以把椅子拉开变成躺椅。往后是第二客舱，它是餐厅型的，有四十八个座位，每两排面对面的座位前有一张长方形小桌。紧靠第二客舱的是小卖部，飞机上的服务员就在这里。穿过小卖部再向后走，是两间有三个座位的单舱，接着是四间可睡三人的小卧舱。小卧舱的后面是一个可以容纳五十四人的大客舱。飞机的尾部是存衣间和盥洗间。
    飞机的下层用来放行李、货物和邮件，厨房也设在这里。到开饭时间，服务员打一次电话给厨师，两个自动的小电梯就把食物运到上面来了。
    “图—114”的设计照顾到了旅客的舒适，各个客舱都有很好的隔音和保暖设备，即使飞机上升到一万公尺乃至一万二千公尺的高空，也还像在一间舒适的房间里一样。
    我们从飞机尾部出口走出来。大家怀着兴奋的心情对这个银色巨鸟作了最后一瞥。
    “图—114”作了试验飞行之后，还没有正式开航。不久，它就要到世界各国大城市去作客。（附图片）
