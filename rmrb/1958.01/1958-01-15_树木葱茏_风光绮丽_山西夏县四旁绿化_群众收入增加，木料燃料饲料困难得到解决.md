    (Reported by this newspaper) Summer County in Shanxi Province, thanks to strengthened leadership and reliance on the masses, has already achieved the "four sides" (house side, village side, road side, water side) greening tree planting requirements set out in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule.
    Summer County is located in the western part of the Zhongtiao Mountains, with plains and mountains, many large and small rivers, and crisscrossing roads. In the past, although there were a few trees, they were almost all cut down and destroyed under the ravages of the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandits, forming bare mountains and barren surroundings. After liberation, while actively developing grain and cotton production, the Party and the People's Government paid corresponding attention to the development of forestry. Starting in 1952, the masses were mobilized to plant trees. After the establishment of advanced agricultural cooperatives in the spring of the year before last, in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee to "green the motherland in twelve years," a high tide of afforestation and "four sides" greening was launched throughout the county. After five years of effort, the "four sides" greening task has been basically completed. The county has planted more than 12 million trees scattered on all four sides. Including preserved seedlings and wild and cut-over regenerated trees, the total number of planted and cultivated trees is more than 39 million. There are an average of more than 98,000 trees per village, more than 1,100 trees per household, and more than 238 trees per person. Based on 500 trees per mu, this is equivalent to tapping the land potential of more than 700,000 mu, which is almost equal to the total cultivated land area of the county. These trees have greened the five major rivers of Qinglong, Baisha, and Sishui, as well as the crisscrossing irrigation canals, drainage canals, small canals, and the extensive transportation road network, with a total length of more than 2,300 li. Rows and rows of trees, clusters and clusters of trees, have been planted beside the villages and houses in more than 400 natural villages throughout the county, forming a verdant picture of lush trees and beautiful scenery, fundamentally changing the desolate appearance of the past. While greening the four sides, the county has also advanced towards the bare mountains and ridges. Through years of tending, planting, and sowing work, there are now 210,000 mu of mountain forests, accounting for 47% of the suitable forest land.
    "Four sides" greening has not only changed the desolate natural landscape, but has also played a certain role in increasing the income of the masses and supporting industrial construction. For example, the Friendly Agricultural Cooperative in Zhouchen Township had an income of more than 59,000 yuan from trees last year, accounting for 20.8% of the total agricultural income of the cooperative, with an average income of 66 yuan per household. Wang Tingying, a member of the Guodao Village Cooperative, earned 61.3% of his family's total income from trees last year. Gao Shouye, a member of the Zhou Village Cooperative, used the income from trees to build five houses, buy a large cart, a mule, and a bicycle, and still had 120 yuan in savings. The masses admiringly said, "Trees are a treasure for farmers; whoever plants them benefits." Because trees have been planted on all four sides, the difficulties of timber, fuel, and fodder have also been solved. According to incomplete statistics in the county, from 1955 to 1957, more than 45,000 houses were built and repaired, and more than 310,000 various agricultural tools were manufactured, all using locally sourced timber. At the same time, more than 170,000 timber logs were sold to the state, supporting industrial construction. In more than 300 villages with better tree planting, 60% to 70% of farmers solve their fuel problems by pruning trees and sweeping fallen leaves in autumn and winter, saving coal consumption. Last year, during the drought resistance and famine preparedness efforts, the masses collected more than 6 million jin of tree leaves for use as feed and substitute food. The large-scale development of trees has also played a huge supporting role in animal husbandry. The number of pigs in the county has increased from more than 1,500 in 1952 to more than 20,000 now, and the number of sheep has increased from more than 5,000 to more than 23,000.

    树木葱茏　风光绮丽
    山西夏县四旁绿化
    群众收入增加，木料燃料饲料困难得到解决
    本报讯　山西省夏县由于加强领导，依靠群众，已经提前实现农业发展纲要（修正草案）里所提出四旁（宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁）绿化的植树要求。
    夏县位于中条山西部，有平原，有山地，大小河流很多，道路纵横交错。过去虽有少数树木，但在日寇与蒋阎匪帮的摧残下，几乎全被砍伐破坏，形成童山秃岭，四旁焦荒。解放后，党和人民政府在积极发展粮、棉生产的同时，相应地注意了发展林业。从1952年起，就开始动员群众栽植树木，在前年春季农业高级合作化以后，又按照党中央提出的“在十二年内，绿化祖国”的要求，在全县范围内，掀起了植树造林四旁绿化的高潮。经过五年的努力，基本上完成了四旁绿化任务。全县共在四旁零星植树一千二百多万株，连同保苗和野生及伐后萌芽更新的树木，总共植育树三千九百多万株，平均每村有树九万八千多株，每户有一千一百多株，每人有二百三十八株。按五百株一亩地计算，就等于挖掘土地潜力七十多万亩，同全县耕地总面积几乎相等。这些树木绿化了较大的青龙、白沙、涑水等五大河流，和纵横交错的灌溉渠、排水渠、小毛渠以及四通八达的交通道路网，全长达二千三百多里。在全县四百多个自然村的村旁、宅旁都栽起了排排行行、丛丛棵棵的树木，构成一幅树木葱茏，风光绮丽的翠绿色图画，根本改变了过去荒凉的面貌。在四旁绿化的同时，还向童山秃岭进军，几年来经过抚育、栽植和播种工作，现在有山林二十一万亩，占宜林地的47％。
    四旁绿化，不仅改变了荒凉的自然面貌，而且对增加群众收入，支援工业建设，也起了一定作用。例如周陈乡友好农业社，去年树木方面的收入达五万九千多元，占全社农业总收入的20.8％，每户平均收入六十六元。郭道村社员王廷英，去年树木收入占全家总收入的61.3％，周村社员高守业用树木收入盖房五间，买大车一辆，骡子一头，自行车一辆，还存款一百二十元。群众羡慕地说：“树是农家宝，谁栽对谁好”。由于在四旁栽起树来，也解决了木料、燃料和饲料的困难。全县据不完全的统计，从1955年到1957年，修盖房屋四万五千多间，修制各种农具三十一万多件，所用木料都由本地解决。同时还出售给国家木料十七万多根，支援了工业建设。在植树较好的三百多个村庄里，每年通过剪修树木和秋冬扫落叶，使60％—70％的农户，解决了燃料，节约了用煤。去年在抗旱备荒中，群众采集树叶六百多万斤，作为饲料和代食品。由于大量发展了树木，对畜牧业也起了极大的支援作用。全县从1952年到现在，猪由一千五百多只发展为二万多只，羊由五千多只发展到二万三千多只。
