　　From 1957 into 1958. Who doesn't stride across this heroic and豪迈 step with head held high!

　　Of course, this year, like last year and every New Year since liberation, we joyfully send off a year of victory and welcome an even greater year of victory. But this year is different from previous years, the joy in my heart is hard to suppress.

　　Amidst the sounds of the New Year's Eve, good news of production and construction from all over the country is frequently reported, reporting the successful completion or over-completion of the production tasks of the first five-year plan. It is not surprising that the heart beats faster with each piece of good news; but this year, the heart beats especially fast and is especially excited. Because this year, this heart is a heart even more filled with will and strength of confidence.

　　1957 has just passed. What a meaningful year! A year ago, even in dreams, we did not dream that such a serious class struggle would unfold on the political and ideological front of the broad masses of the people. A small handful of reactionary bourgeois right-wingers stirred up a sky full of dark clouds. But the enemies are also our "teachers," they really gave us many good "problems." After more than half a year of life-and-death struggle, we have thoroughly defeated the enemy, and in the struggle, we have received profound education and combat training. Poisonous weeds have been transformed into "fertilizer," making our "seedlings in the greenhouse" grow stronger and able to withstand the test of "wind and rain" even more. In the tail end of the anti-Rightist struggle, rectification began. Rectification brought the vigorous energy of early spring ahead of time in the late autumn season.

　　What did a struggle clarify? It clarified that the 600 million people are all of one heart and mind, wholeheartedly following the Communist Party; it clarified that in all things, from politics, ideology, literature, art, science, technology, to life and style, there are two lines, and the socialist road is the one the 600 million people want to take; it clarified what a wise and correct party the Chinese Communist Party is, that every Chinese person who loves the motherland cannot but support and love from the bottom of their hearts; it clarified that in whatever we do, we must have the leadership of the Party, without the leadership of the Party, the cause itself cannot be accomplished, and the individual will accomplish nothing; in addition, it also clarified that as intellectuals of the new China, we must be "both red and expert," and must constantly transform ourselves, learn until old age, and change until old age, so that we can become intellectuals of the working class. All of this was originally clear, but now it is further clarified.

　　With all of this clarified, the confidence of the people of the whole country has become even more firm. The Party has given us the task—the agricultural development program: 400 jin, 500 jin, 800 jin; industrial targets: catch up with or surpass England within fifteen years! Cadres are sent down: to the countryside, to the factories, to the mountains. Build the country with diligence and thrift...manage the household with diligence and thrift. More, faster, better, and more economical. How clear, how specific, how realistic!

　　This is how the Party leads us—leading us ideologically, politically, and organizationally. It has given us confidence and drive.

　　Fifteen years is not a very long time in a person's life, but in the five thousand years of history, it is only three thousandths! From this time concept, the prosperous, happy, and strong socialist motherland is not some "prospect," but tomorrow that is about to arrive! Thinking of this, who can not feel full of energy!

　　In 1957, such great changes took place in our motherland. These changes mainly sowed the seeds of drive in the hearts of 600 million people, making young hearts stronger, and making middle-aged and old hearts younger. Six hundred million young and strong hearts, united together, what a powerful force that is. It is as strong as steel, capable of overturning mountains and seas. It is with such a heart that we welcome 1958 and begin the second five-year plan. Many intellectuals have also made up their minds to constantly learn and transform themselves so that they can become true working-class intellectuals. On this day next year, let us use doubled pride and confidence, louder firecrackers and gongs and drums, and clearer songs to celebrate the more, bigger, and more glorious victories of 1958!

    谁能不感到全身是劲！
    梁思成
    从1957年踏进1958年。谁不昂首阔步地踏过这英雄的、豪迈的
  一步！
    当然，今年也同去年，以及解放以来每一个新年一样，欢欣鼓舞地送一个胜利年，迎接一个更大的胜利年。但是今年不同往年，快乐在心头，倍难抑制。
    岁除声中，各地生产建设的捷报频传，报告着第一个五年计划生产任务胜利完成或超额完成，心随着每一个捷报而更加跳跃，本不是稀奇事；而今年的心，却特别跳动，特别兴奋。因为今年这颗心是一颗更加充满了意志和力量的信心。
    1957年刚过去了。多么富有意义的一年！一年前，梦也没有梦到在广大人民的政治思想战线上会展开一场这样严重的阶级斗争。一小撮反动的资产阶级右派分子，竟搅得乌云满天。但是敌人也是我们的“老师”，他们真给我们出了许多好“题目”。半年多的殊死战，我们已把敌人彻底打垮，在斗争中我们得到了深刻的教育和战斗的锻炼。毒草化为“肥料”，使我们这些“温室里的幼苗”茁壮起来，更能经得起“风雨”的考验。反右派斗争尾声中，整改开始了。整改给晚秋时节提早带来了初春的蓬勃干劲。
    一场斗争明确了什么？明确了六亿人民都一心一意、死心踏地地要跟着共产党走；明确了在一切事物中，从政治、思想、文学、艺术、科学、技术乃至生活、作风中都存在着两条路线的问题，而六亿人民所要走的是社会主义道路；明确了中国共产党是一个多么英明、正确，令每一个爱祖国的中国人所不能不从心眼底下拥护、爱戴的伟大的党；明确了无论做什么事都必须有党的领导，没有党的领导，事业本身就做不成，个人则一事无成；此外还明确了作为新中国的知识分子，必须“又红又专”，必须不断地改造自己，学习到老改到老，使自己成为一个工人阶级的知识分子。这一切本来是已明确了的，现在却进一步更明确了。
    这一切明确了，全国人民信心更加坚定了，党把任务交给了我们——农业发展纲要：四百斤、五百斤、八百斤；工业指标：十五年内赶上或超过英国！干部下放：下乡，下厂，上山。勤俭建国……勤俭持家。多，快，好，省。多么鲜明，多么具体，多么现实！
    党就是这样领导我们——在思想上，政策上，组织上领导我们。给了我们信心，给了我们干劲。
    十五年在一个人的生命中本已不算很长的时间，而在五千年的历史中，仅仅算是千分之三！从这样的时间概念上看来，繁荣、幸福、富强的社会主义祖国并不是什么“远景”，而是即将到来的明天了！想到这里，谁能不感到全身是劲！
    1957年在我们祖国发生了这样大的变化，这变化主要在六亿颗心里播下了干劲的种子，使年轻的心更坚强，使中年、老年的心更年轻。六亿颗年轻、坚强的心，凝结在一起，这是多么强大的力量。它坚似钢铁，可以排山倒海。我们正是以这样的心，迎接1958年，来开始第二个五年计划。不少知识分子还下了决心，不断学习，改造自己，使自己成为真正的工人阶级知识分子。明年今日，让我们用加倍的自豪和信心，更响的鞭炮、锣鼓，更清脆的歌声来庆祝1958年更多、更大、更辉煌的胜利吧！
