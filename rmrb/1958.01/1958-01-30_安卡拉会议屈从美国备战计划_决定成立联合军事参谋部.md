Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, 29th: The Baghdad Pact Council decided on the 28th to establish a Joint Military Planning Staff Department to serve the United States' military aggression conspiracy in the Middle East region.

The chairman of this joint staff department will be Turkish Lieutenant General Ekrem Akalin, and the vice-chairman will be U.S. Air Force Major General Daniel Campbell. The staff department includes eighteen permanent military officers from the five formal member states of the Baghdad Pact and the United States.

The staff department will be located in Baghdad. This organization replaces the military planning organization established by the Baghdad Pact Group in Karachi last year.

The news of the establishment of the Joint Military Planning Staff Department was announced by Baghdad Pact Secretary-General Khalidi at a press conference on the 28th. He agreed that the establishment of this staff department was a "step" towards the establishment of a joint command. U.S. Air Force Major General Campbell, who will serve as the vice-chairman of the staff department, said at the press conference that the staff department will formulate military plans for the member states. This shows that the United States is attempting to further control the military forces of the treaty member states through the establishment of this organization, tightly binding these countries to the U.S. war chariot.

Sources say that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles reiterated his previous proposal at the meeting, namely to have more "exchange of intelligence" between military aggression groups such as the Baghdad Pact, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

At the same time, news from Western news agencies continues to reveal the contradictions and differences between the participating countries. An Associated Press report stated that the task faced by Dulles and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd in coordinating the military plans of their Muslim friends was obviously "not easy."

    安卡拉会议屈从美国备战计划
    决定成立联合军事参谋部
    据新华社29日讯　安卡拉消息：巴格达条约理事会28日决定成立联合军事计划参谋部，来为美国在中东地区军事侵略阴谋服务。
    这个联合参谋部的主席将由土耳其中将埃卡伦·阿卡林担任，副主席将由美国空军少将丹尼尔·坎贝尔担任。参谋部包括来自巴格达条约五个正式成员国和美国的十八名常任军官。
    参谋部将设在巴格达。这个机构代替了巴格达条约集团去年在卡拉奇建立的军事计划组织。
    成立联合军事计划参谋部的消息是巴格达条约秘书长哈利迪28日在记者招待会上宣布的。他同意成立这个参谋部是走向成立联合司令部的一个“步骤”。将担任参谋部副主席的美国空军少将坎贝尔在这个记者招待会上说，参谋部将为各成员国拟订军事计划。这就表明，美国企图借成立这个机构进一步控制条约成员国的军事力量，把这些国家紧紧地捆绑在美国的战车上。
    有消息说，美国国务卿杜勒斯在会上重申了他以前的建议，即在巴格达条约、北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织等军事侵略集团之间，更多地“交换情报”。
    同时，在西方通讯社的消息中继续透露出各与会国之间的矛盾和分歧，美联社消息说，杜勒斯和英国外交大臣劳埃德所面临的调配它们的穆斯林朋友们的军事计划的任务显然“不是容易的”。
