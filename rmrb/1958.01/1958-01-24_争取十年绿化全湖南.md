Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Dispatch: Hunan Province, despite the extremely tight winter production schedule, has launched a vigorous winter afforestation campaign by universally organizing afforestation professional teams. As of the 10th, the province has planted more than 1,160,000 mu of tung oil and tea oil trees, and reclaimed tens of thousands of mu of tea oil forests.

Due to the great enthusiasm of the agricultural cooperatives for afforestation, the province's afforestation plan has been repeatedly exceeded. According to preliminary statistics, it has increased from 5 million mu to 7 million mu and it is expected that it can be completed before the Spring Festival.

In order to conscientiously implement the task of "Greening all of Hunan in Ten Years," various localities have generally convened representative meetings to study how to resolve the contradiction between winter production and afforestation in terms of manpower arrangement. After discussion, they finally found the organizational form of setting up afforestation professional teams. According to the situation in the past 20 days, this organizational form can not only solve the contradiction between production and afforestation, but also speed up the afforestation progress. For example, nine counties including Shaoyang and Luxi organized 6,391 professional teams, and the afforestation progress was very fast. The quality was also up to standard after inspection. The 48 professional teams in Shiyangtang Township, You County, afforested 10,558 mu in ten days.

Hunan is one of the main producing areas of tung oil and tea oil in China. This year, it plans to cultivate 725,000 mu of tung oil forests and 405,000 mu of tea oil forests. In addition, it is also necessary to reclaim 2 million mu of tea oil forests.

    争取十年绿化全湖南
    新华社长沙电　湖南省在冬季生产十分紧张的情况下，由于普遍组织造林专业队，冬季造林运动仍然猛烈地开展起来。到10日止，全省已经植造桐油、油茶等林一百一十六万多亩，垦复油茶林几十万亩。
    由于各农业社造林的劲头很大，省的造林计划一再被突破，据初步统计，已由五百万亩增加到七百万亩。预计在春节前可以全部完成。
    各地为了认真执行“十年绿化全湖南”的任务，普遍召开了代表会议，研究如何解决冬季生产和造林在人力安排上的矛盾。经过讨论，终于找到组织造林专业队这种组织形式。根据二十多天的情况看来，这种组织形式不仅能解决生产和造林的矛盾问题，而且能加快造林进度。例如邵阳、泸溪等九个县组织了六千三百九十一个专业队，造林进度很快，质量经检查也合乎规格。攸县石羊塘乡的四十八个专业队，十天中就造林一万零五百五十八亩。
    湖南是我国桐油、油茶的主要产区之一。今年计划培育桐油林七十二万五千亩，油茶林四十万五千亩，此外还要垦复油茶林二百万亩。
