Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 17th: Czechoslovak Premier Viliam Široký and his entourage arrived in Phnom Penh on the afternoon of the 16th for a four-day visit. Those present at the airport to welcome him included: members of the new cabinet headed by Prince Sihanouk, ministers from the previous cabinet, other high-ranking officials and officers, members of the diplomatic corps, and Ye Jinghao, head of the Chinese economic delegation.

Chairman of the State Reception Committee, Tep Phan, and Premier Široký delivered speeches to each other. Tep Phan said: "We share common aspirations for fundamental human issues, which makes our two countries permanent friends. The cultural and trade agreements recently signed by our two governments, the generous assistance given by the Czechoslovak people to the Cambodian people, and Czechoslovakia's continued strong support for Cambodia and its neutral policy, all specifically demonstrate the friendship between Cambodia and Czechoslovakia. At the same time, this friendship irrefutably proves that despite differing ideologies and systems, international understanding is still possible."

In his reply, Široký said that Cambodia's neutral policy has contributed to peace in Asia and the world. He hoped that his visit would further strengthen mutual understanding between the two countries.

The Czechoslovak Premier was warmly welcomed by the people lining the streets as he traveled by car to the Royal Palace.

    泰普潘致欢迎词感谢捷克斯洛伐克的援助
    据新华社金边17日电　捷克斯洛伐克总理西罗基和他的随行人员16日下午到达金边，作为期四天的访问。到机场欢迎的有：以宾努亲王为首的新内阁的阁员、前任内阁的大臣及其它高级官员和军官、各国外交团成员和中国经济代表团团长叶景灏。
    国家接待委员会主席泰普潘和西罗基总理相互致词。泰普潘说：“我们对人类根本问题有着一致的愿望，这就使我们两国成为永久的朋友。我们两国政府前不久签订的文化和贸易协定、捷克斯洛伐克人民给予柬埔寨人民的慷慨援助、捷克斯洛伐克不断对柬埔寨以及它的中立政策予以有力的支持，这些都具体地表明柬埔寨和捷克斯洛伐克两国之间的友谊，同时这种友谊无可争辩地证明：尽管思想意识和制度互不相同，国际谅解仍然是可能的。”
    西罗基在答词中说，柬埔寨的中立政策对亚洲和世界和平作出了贡献。他希望，他的访问将会进一步加强两国间的互相了解。
    捷克斯洛伐克总理乘车去王宫的时候受到人民的夹道欢迎。
