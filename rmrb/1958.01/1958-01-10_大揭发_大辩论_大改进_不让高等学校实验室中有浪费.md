Great Exposure, Great Debate, Great Improvement
No Waste Allowed in University Laboratories

    This newspaper reports that the Beijing College of Geological Exploration, in conjunction with its rectification efforts, has established a special laboratory inspection team to examine waste in the spirit of "Great Exposure, Great Debate, Great Improvement." Preliminary statistics show that the losses caused by stockpiling and waste in the Geophysical Prospecting Teaching and Research Office alone amount to more than 100,000 yuan.
    Many people one-sidedly believe that instruments and equipment should be complete, new, and good. The gravity group, which has the most serious stockpiling, bought eight electric computers in 1954. Not only was the efficiency of use very low, but they became inoperable due to long-term disuse, or the gears were stuck, costing more than 200 yuan in repair fees. Why did they buy so many at that time? It was under the guidance of the so-called "want the most perfect equipment" and "world-class" thinking that they spent tens of thousands of yuan to buy them. This group also spent 19,000 yuan to purchase ten imported densitometers, which were idled for two years without use. According to the current price of domestically produced densitometers with the same performance, only 2,000 yuan would have been enough. Other wasteful phenomena, such as blindly purchasing six electric drills (when only two were actually needed), buying eight Czech multimeters and more organic glass than actually required, and buying chargers worth about 10,000 yuan that were not suitable, were also extremely serious.
    Some groups lacked comprehensive consideration and careful calculation in the trial production and equipping of instruments and laboratories. For example, the radioactivity group assembled a counter. After it was assembled, it was discovered that the resistor was not good, so all of it was disassembled and redone, wasting more than 400 resistors. However, they did not learn from this lesson and continued to install in large quantities. As a result, the electron tubes were not suitable and were disassembled again, leaving all the more than 200 electron tubes they bought stockpiled. This back-and-forth not only wasted 1,300 yuan but also took a lot of man-hours.
    This newspaper reports that several teaching and research offices at Shandong Institute of Technology have exposed the stockpiling and waste of teaching equipment.
    The pressure processing laboratory purchased a horizontal forging machine worth more than 90,000 yuan, but its efficiency was not high, wasting state resources. Many laboratories have exposed the serious phenomenon of buying too much and buying repeatedly. Some laboratories already had two sequence converters, six gold-closing relays, and two sets of automatic synchronizers, but they did not actually need so many.

### 大揭发　大辩论　大改进  不让高等学校实验室中有浪费

    大揭发　大辩论　大改进
    不让高等学校实验室中有浪费
    本报讯　北京地质勘探学院结合整改工作，成立了实验室的专门检查小组，以“大揭发、大辩论、大改进”的精神，检查浪费。初步统计，仅物探教研室由于积压浪费造成的损失即达十万元以上。
    许多人都片面地认为，仪器设备要全、要新、要好。积压最严重的重力组，1954年买了八台电动计算机，不但使用效率很低，反而由于长期不用而致运转不灵，或齿轮卡住，倒花了修理费二百多元。为什么当时买这么多呢？就是在所谓
  “要最完善的设备”，“世界第一流”等思想指导下花了数万元去买来的。这个组还花了一万九千元购进了十台进口密度计，闲搁了两年没有用，而按目前同样性能的国产密度计计算，只要二千元就够了。其它如盲目购进六台电钻（实际上只要两台就够了），一下子买了八台捷克万用表和超过实际需要的有机玻璃，买回价值一万元左右但并不适用的充电机等的浪费现象，也是极其严重的。
    有的组在试制和装备仪器和实验室方面，缺乏全面考虑和精打细算的态度。如放射性组装了一台计数器，待装好后，发现其中电阻不好，拆下全部重做，浪费了四百多个电阻；但并未从此吸取教训，又大批的装置，结果因电子管不适用，又拆卸一次，使买回的二百多个电子管全部积压下来。这样来回折腾，不仅浪费了一千三百元，而且花了大量的工时。
    本报讯　山东工学院几个教研室揭发了教学设备的积压和浪费现象。
    压力加工实验室购买了一台价值九万多元的水平锻造机，使用效率不高，浪费了国家资财。许多实验室揭发了多买、重买的现象十分严重。有的实验室已经有了另序变流器两个，金合闸继电器六个，自动整步仪两套，而实际上不要这样多。
