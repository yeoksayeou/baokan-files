    Notes

    It's him again!
    Recently, the United States Information Service issued a telegram with no location and no date. It quoted some remarks by Jamali to slander the Asian-African Solidarity Conference being held in Cairo. Who is this Jamali? He is the same person who acted as a henchman for the United States at the Bandung Conference more than two years ago to disrupt the meeting. The only difference is that at that time, he was openly disrupting the Asian-African Conference as the Prime Minister and representative of Iraq; now, he is hiding in a dark corner, uttering yelping noises.
    In order to undermine the unity of the Asian and African peoples, the United States is searching everywhere for people who spread rumors and cause trouble. But after searching and searching, they still have to bring out this Jamali, who has already been thrown off the political stage by the times. How sad!

    又是他！
    最近，美国新闻处发出了一条无地点、无日期的电讯。它引用了贾马利的一些言论，来污蔑正在开罗举行的亚非团结大会。这个贾马利是什么人呢？就是两年多以前在万隆会议上充当美国打手去捣乱会场的那个人。所不同的，那时候他是作为伊拉克的首相和代表在亚非会议上公开捣乱；而现在，他是躲在一个黑暗的角落里发出狺狺之声。
    美国为了破坏亚非人民的团结，到处搜罗造谣生事的人，而搜罗来搜罗去，却还是不得不搬出这个已经被时代抛出政治舞台的贾马利来，岂不悲哉！
