    Arrange Winter Vacation Life Well

    The primary and secondary schools across the country have successively started their winter vacations. This year, primary and secondary school teachers will undergo rectification during the winter vacation, so the vacation time is longer than in previous years, and the majority of students will have a vacation of one to two months outside of school. How to arrange the winter vacation life of primary and secondary school students is a very important matter.
    What can students do during the winter vacation? Besides reviewing their lessons well and doing their homework, there are many things they can do. For example, participating in productive labor is an important activity. Students' participation in productive labor can not only consolidate and expand the knowledge learned in the classroom, cultivate the habit of loving labor, and establish a style of hard work and plain living, but also, some students who participate in paid labor can earn some income to solve their educational expenses. Participating in the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests is also an important part of the winter vacation activities for primary and secondary school students. We know that the fundamental spirit of the patriotic health campaign is to cultivate good habits of everyone being hygienic and every family loving cleanliness, to eliminate diseases, to invigorate everyone, to change customs and habits, and to transform the country. This is a broad, nationwide movement, and everyone must participate, and primary and secondary school students are naturally no exception. Children and teenagers can make contributions in eliminating the four pests. The emergence of many small heroes in eliminating the four pests in various places is a good proof. Of course, children and teenagers should pay attention to safety and avoid danger when climbing high and going low in the four-pest elimination campaign. Cities and villages that are carrying out socialist debates can also organize some students to participate in order to improve their political and ideological awareness.
    The things mentioned above are important parts of students' winter vacation activities, but they are not the only things. Localities should also organize students' cultural and recreational activities, and intersperse cultural and recreational activities with participation in labor, elimination of the four pests, and major debates, etc., so that children and teenagers can receive necessary exercise and also get necessary rest.
    In the past, educational departments, schools, the Communist Youth League, and relevant social organizations had experience in organizing children's winter vacation activities, but it is necessary to recognize the characteristics of this year's winter vacation being longer than previous winter vacations, and pay more attention to the winter vacation life of children and teenagers. It should be known that in such a long period of time, if there is a lack of timely and planned guidance, the winter vacation life of students will become self-directed, and even some students will be affected by some residual unhealthy trends in society, engaging in improper activities and reading poisonous books, resulting in harm to their physical and mental health.
    Let everyone care about children and teenagers, arrange a good winter vacation for them, so that they can be exercised, increase their knowledge, get rest, be full of energy, and happily welcome the start of the new semester.

    好好安排寒假生活
    祖年
    全国中小学已经先后放寒假了。今年寒假里，中小学教师要进行整风，放假时间比往年长，广大学生在校外将有一个月到两个月的假期。如何安排中小学生的寒假生活，是一件很重要的事情。
    学生在寒假中，可以做些什么事呢？除了复习好功课、作好作业以外，可做的事很多。比如参加生产劳动，就是一项重要活动。学生参加生产劳动不仅可以巩固、扩大课堂学到的知识，培养热爱劳动的习惯，树立艰苦朴素的作风，一部分参加有报酬的劳动的学生，还可有所收入，用以解决求学费用。参加以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，也是中小学生寒假活动的一项重要内容。我们知道，爱国卫生运动的根本精神，是为了养成人人讲卫生，家家爱清洁的良好习惯，是为了消灭疾病，人人振奋，移风易俗，改造国家。这是一个广泛的全民性的运动，每个人都要参加，中小学生自然也不能例外。少年儿童在除四害方面是能够作出贡献的，各地出现了许多除四害的小英雄，就是很好的证明。自然，少年儿童在除四害运动中由于爬高上低，要注意安全，避免危险。正在开展社会主义大辩论的城市和农村，也可以组织一部分学生参加，来提高他们的政治思想觉悟。
    以上所说这些事情是学生寒假活动的重要内容，但是并不是唯一的内容。各地还要组织学生文化娱乐活动，并且使文化娱乐活动和参加劳动、除四害、大辩论等等交错进行，使少年儿童受到必要的锻炼，同时也得到必要的休息。
    过去教育部门、学校、青年团和社会有关方面组织儿童寒假活动是有经验的，但是要认识到今年寒假比每年寒假时间长的特点，更加重视少年儿童的寒假生活。要知道，在这样长的时期里，如果缺乏及时的有计划的指导，学生寒假生活就会变成自流状态，甚至有的学生被社会上的一些残余的不良风气所影响，进行不正当的活动和阅读有毒的书籍，以致身心受到戕害。
    大家都来关怀少年儿童，为少年儿童安排一个良好的寒假，使他们受到锻炼，增加知识，得到休息，精神饱满，快快活活地迎接新学期的开始。
