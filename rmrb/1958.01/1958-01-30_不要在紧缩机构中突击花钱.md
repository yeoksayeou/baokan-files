    Don't Splurge in Shrinking Institutions

    To the Editor:

    Based on the Party's instructions and the opinions raised by the masses during the Great Blooming and Contending, our ministry decided to streamline existing institutions and abolish several units, including the General Bureau of Capital Construction. After this announcement, the trade union of the General Bureau of Capital Construction was the first to get busy. They weren't busy with anything else, but with a spending spree. They were deeply afraid that their remaining funds of 7,000 yuan might benefit others, so they came up with various ways to spend the money. In this cold winter, they organized employees to visit the Ming Tombs on a suburban outing; they repeatedly bought tickets for employees to watch dramas, including "The Man with a Gun," "Sakuntala," and "Three Stars Shine Brightly"; on the evening of the 12th, they spent 900 yuan to book a performance of "The Tale of the White Snake" at the People's Theater. Because the venue was large and there were few people, the tickets couldn't be distributed, so they issued tickets to family members. Employees with family members received an extra ticket, and single employees without family members also received an extra ticket. As a result, even with this distribution, there were still tickets that couldn't be given away, so they were sold at half price.

    We believe that the Coal Ministry's General Bureau of Capital Construction trade union's practice of spending money in this way seriously violates the spirit of building the country diligently and frugally, and of hard work and simplicity. In particular, this phenomenon is happening during the rectification campaign, which is intolerable. In addition to criticizing it in large-character posters within our organization, we believe it is necessary to bring it to the attention of the public in the newspaper.

### 不要在紧缩机构中突击花钱

    不要在紧缩机构中突击花钱编辑同志：
    我部根据党的指示及大鸣大放中群众提出的意见，决定紧缩现有机构，将基本建设总局等几个单位撤销。这事宣布以后，首先忙坏了基本建设总局的工会。他们忙的不是别的事，忙的是突击花钱。他们深恐那一笔七千元的余款利益有所外溢，于是，想出种种办法把这笔钱花出去。在这样寒冷的冬天，他们组织职工去郊游十三陵；他们一再买票请职工去看话剧，又是“带枪的人”，又是“沙恭达罗”，又是“三星高照”；12日晚，又花九百元包了人民剧场一个场子，请职工去看“白蛇传”。因为场大人少，票子发不出去，于是，就发家属票，有家属的职工多送一张，单身职工没有家属的也多送一张。结果，这样分配下来，还是有票发不出去，即半票出售。
    我们认为煤炭部基本建设总局工会这种突击花钱的做法，严重违背了勤俭建国、艰苦朴素的精神，特别是这种现象发生在整改高潮中，这是令人不能容忍的，我们除以大字报在本机关内提出批评外，认为有必要在报上提出引起注意。
