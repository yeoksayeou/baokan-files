    Four-Axis Automatic Lathe
    Workers at the Shenyang Third Machine Tool Factory recently successfully trial-produced China's first four-axis automatic lathe. After test runs, both light and heavy cutting performance was good.
    This lathe is ten to twenty times more efficient than ordinary lathes and is suitable for the aviation and tractor industries. It can process round, square, and hexagonal bar stock. At each position of the main shaft, it can simultaneously perform longitudinal cutting, transverse cutting, profile cutting, threading, tapping, drilling, reaming, and boring on the parts being processed. Except for manual loading of bar stock, all other operations are automated. Steel shavings produced by the machine can also be automatically discharged by the chip removal device inside the machine body.

    Seismograph and Gas Meter
    The Xi'an Geophysical Instrument Repair and Manufacturing Plant of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has successfully trial-produced the 26-55-1 type seismograph and the 57-1 type gas meter, and will soon begin small-scale production.
    The 26-55-1 type seismograph is manufactured in imitation of the Soviet CC-26-51B type seismograph. It is not an instrument for recording natural earthquakes, but an instrument for geophysicists to use artificial methods to calculate the depth, dip, and distribution of underground strata. This instrument can be used for oil exploration and other purposes.
    The 57-1 type gas meter is manufactured in imitation of the Soviet ГRC-2 type gas meter. It can identify and classify oil and gas layers of formations during oil well drilling, and can also quickly analyze mud on-site to measure pump speed, drilling speed, and drilling depth, thus maintaining normal drilling operations.

    Two Heavy-Duty Machine Tools
    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory has recently successfully manufactured three heavy-duty machine tools. Two of them are 7242A type gantry planers. This type of planer weighs 37 tons, is six meters long and 1.5 meters wide, and can process objects weighing ten tons. The other is an M312A type one-ton forging hammer, with an impact force of three and a half tons, which is a steam and air dual-purpose forging hammer.

    150-Atmosphere Cement Truck
    The Lanzhou General Machinery Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a 150-atmosphere cement truck. Cement trucks are used to supply cement for drilling and well cementing in petroleum bases and were previously imported from the Soviet Union and other democratic countries.
    The cement truck is installed on a heavy-duty truck with complex machine parts such as water pumps, plungers, and gasoline engine cement mixers, to increase the normal air pressure to 150 atmospheres after mixing water and cement. (Liang Xiangcang et al.)

    Loudspeaker That Can Transmit Sound Fifteen Li
    The "Air Compression Loudspeaker" manufactured by the Shanghai Liwen Radio Factory has a loud transmission sound, and music broadcast from the loudspeaker can be clearly heard within a radius of fifteen li.
    This loudspeaker is very suitable for units with large areas and workers scattered in distant areas, such as mines, farms, forest logging areas, and airports.

    四轴自动车床
    沈阳第三机床厂职工最近试制成功了我国第一台四轴自动车床。经过试车，轻重切削情况良好。
    这台车床比一般车床效率高十到二十倍，适用于航空工业、拖拉机工业。它可以加工圆料、四方的和六方的棒料；在主轴的各个位置上，可以对加工的零件同时进行纵切削、横切削、成形切削、切螺纹、套螺纹、钻孔、扩孔、绞孔等加工。除做棒料时，上料需工人亲自动手外，其余都是自动化的。机床加工出来的钢屑，也可以由床身内部的清屑器自动输出。
    地震仪和气测仪
    石油工业部西安地球物理仪器修造厂试制26—55—1型地震仪和57—1型气测仪成功，并且即将开始小批生产。
    26—55—1型地震仪，是仿照苏联CC—26—51B型地震仪制造的。它不是记录天然地震的仪器，而是供地球物理学家们用人工方法算出地下地层的深度、倾角和分布情况的仪器。这种仪器可用于寻找石油和其他方面的用途。
    57—1型气测仪是仿苏联ГRC—2型气测仪制造的。它可以在油井钻探过程中，查明并划分出构造的油层和气层，还可以就地快速分析泥浆，测定泵速、钻速、进尺深度等。使钻井工作保持正常。　（陈斌）
    两种重型机床
    武汉重型机床厂最近制造成功了三台重型机床。其中有两台是7242A型龙门刨床。这种刨床重三十七吨，身长六公尺，宽一点五公尺，能加工十吨重的物件。另外一台M312A型一吨的锻锤，冲击力有三吨半，是一种蒸汽和空气的两用锻锤。
    150大气压水泥车
    兰州通用机器厂最近试制150大气压水泥车成功。水泥车是供给石油基地钻探箍井使用的，过去都是由苏联和其他民主国家进口。
    水泥车是在重型载重汽车上安装水泵、冶塞齿、汽油机水泥混合器等复杂机器零件，要使水和水泥混合后由正常的气压提高到150的大气压。

    传声能达十五里的喇叭
    上海利闻无线电厂制成的“空气压缩扬声器”传声宏大，周围十五里的地方都能清楚地听到喇叭里播送的音乐。
    这种扬声器很适合矿山、农场、森林采伐区和飞机场等，面积大，工人们分散在很远的地区工作的单位使用。
