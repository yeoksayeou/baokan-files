    Vigorously Promote the "Retrogression Faction"
    Xing Huan
    Difficulties are something everyone encounters. For the promotion faction, difficulties are the driving force for "promotion"; for the retrogression faction, however, they become an excuse for "retrogression."

    To achieve the forty articles of the National Agricultural Development Program within twelve years, raising grain production to 400, 500, or 800 catties; and in industry, to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in about fifteen years—for a poor and large country like ours, the targets are undeniably high, and the difficulties are undeniably great. Faced with such targets and difficulties, the promotion faction is spirited and full of energy, trying every possible means to overcome difficulties and strive to achieve them; the retrogression faction, on the other hand, hesitates and shrinks back in the face of difficulties, fearing that the targets are too high and impossible to achieve.

    Now, after further implementing the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee, there are more and more promoters among leading cadres and the masses, and fewer and fewer regressors. However, according to inspections by several provincial and municipal Party committees, there are still many regressors among the cadres. Some people underestimate the productive enthusiasm of the masses and other favorable conditions, and overestimate the unfavorable conditions. They are always afraid to break conventions and boldly lead the masses to make a great leap forward in production; although some have begun to muster some revolutionary enthusiasm and have also started to jump a little, compared to the actual needs and possibilities, their revolutionary vigor and revolutionary enthusiasm are still insufficient, not even close to being twelve thousand percent.

    In the face of this situation, what should the promoters among leading cadres, especially the upper-level leaders, do? The only way is to "promote" the regressors. In other words, upper-level leading cadres should try to instill their advanced ideas into these cadres, so that they can also become promoters full of revolutionary enthusiasm. Because these cadres generally hold middle or lower-level leadership positions, they play a role in linking the upper and lower levels in our national life. The Party and the state's policies and guidelines, and the intentions of the upper-level leaders, must rely on them to be conveyed to the masses and lead the masses to implement them. Various work tasks must rely on them to be arranged downwards and lead the masses to complete them; the various opinions, situations, and demands of the masses need them to be reflected upwards, as a reference and basis for the Party and the state to formulate policies and regulations. These cadres are like the body of a dragon. It is inconceivable that the head and tail of the dragon move while the body does not, and that this dragon can still become a strong and vigorous dragon like a long rainbow. Therefore, to transform advanced ideas and advanced indicators into a vivid reality, we must first "promote" the regressors among cadres so that the body of the dragon also moves.

    The method of promotion is to do ideological work for the regressors. We can use the method of presenting facts and reasoning through great debates to enable the regressors to correctly recognize the favorable and unfavorable aspects of things, correctly estimate the objective situation and subjective forces, and learn how to turn unfavorable factors into favorable ones and negative factors into positive ones, eliminate right-leaning conservative thinking, muster revolutionary enthusiasm, and attack difficulties and advanced indicators. The recently held Jilin Provincial Party Congress and the recent meeting of provincial, municipal, and county Party committee secretaries convened by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China both implemented the Party Central Committee's instructions on resolutely opposing right-leaning ideology, criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking among cadres, and demanded that leaders at all levels demonstrate revolutionary enthusiasm, catch up with the current revolutionary situation, and promote a great leap forward in production. There are similar situations in industrial production. Not long ago, the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting to criticize the right-leaning conservative thinking of some factory and mining enterprise leaders who had little leadership style, insufficient enthusiasm, emphasized difficulties, and dared not set advanced indicators in the face of the new high tide of production; the person in charge of the Jiaozuo Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also personally went to the Jiaozuo Coal Mine to promote, helping the Wangfeng and Lifeng mines to revise their low production plans. These practices have all played a role in "promoting" the regressors. It can be expected that in places where the regressors have been "promoted," a great leap forward in production and work will soon appear!

    大力促进“促退派”
    星环
    困难，是每一个人都会遇到的。对于促进派来说，困难是“促进”的动力；对于促退派，则不同，它成了“促退”的借口。
    要在十二年内实现农业发展纲要四十条，把粮食产量提高到四百斤、五百斤、八百斤；工业方面，主要工业品的产量，要在十五年左右赶上或超过英国，对于我们这样一个又穷又大的国家来说，指标不可谓不高，困难也不可谓不大。面对着这样的指标和困难，促进派是精神抖抖、干劲十足，想尽千方百计一定要战胜困难，努力实现；促退派则在困难面前逡巡畏缩、犹豫徘徊，唯恐指标太高，无力实现。
    现在，经过进一步贯彻党的三中全会的精神，领导干部和人民群众中的促进派愈来愈多，促退派愈来愈少。但是，根据若干省、市委的检查，干部中的促退派也还不少。有些人把群众的生产积极性和其他有利条件估计太低，把不利条件估计得太高，总是不敢突破常规，不敢大胆放手地领导群众在生产上来个大跃进；有些人虽然开始鼓起了一些革命干劲，也开始跳了一下，但比起实际需要与可能来，他们的革命朝气、革命干劲还是不足，还没有大到十二万分。
    在这种情况面前，领导干部中的促进派，特别是上级领导应该怎么办呢？唯一的办法，就是“促进”促退派。也就是说，上级领导干部要设法把自己的先进思想灌输给这些干部，使他们也能变成革命干劲十足的促进派。因为这些干部一般的担任着中层或基层领导工作，他们在我们国家生活中，起着承上启下的作用，党和国家的方针、政策、上级领导的意图要依靠他们转达给人民群众，并领导人民群众来贯彻执行，各项工作任务要依靠他们向下布置并领导人民群众来完成；人民群众中的各种意见、情况和要求，需要他们反映到上面去，作为党和国家制定政策、法规的参考和依据。这些干部，正像一条龙的龙身一样。不能设想，龙头、龙尾动而龙身不动，这条龙还能成为一条矫健的、势若长虹的游龙。因此，要使先进的思想、先进的指标变成活生生的现实，首先必须“促进”干部中的促退派，使龙身子也动起来。
    促进的方法，就是要给促退派做思想工作。可以通过大辩论摆事实、讲道理的方法，使促退派正确地认识到事情的有利和不利的两方面，正确地估计客观形势和主观力量，并且学会变不利为有利、化消极为积极的方法，消除右倾保守思想，鼓起革命干劲，向困难、向先进指标进攻。不久以前召开的吉林省党代表大会，和最近中共广东省委召开的省委和地、市、县委书记会议，都贯彻了党中央关于坚决反掉右倾思想的指示，批判了干部中的右倾保守思想，要求各级领导干部拿出革命干劲来，赶上当前的革命形势，促进生产的大跃进。在工业生产方面也有这样的情况，不久以前，中共唐山市委就曾召开会议，批判了某些厂矿企业领导干部在新的生产高潮面前领导气魄不大、干劲不足、强调困难、不敢订出先进指标的右倾保守思想；中共焦作市委负责人还亲自到焦作煤矿去促进，帮助王封、李封两矿修订了偏低的生产计划。这些作法，都起了“促进”促退派的作用。可以预期，在“促进”了促退派地方，不久的将来就将出现生产上和工作上的大跃进！
