Outside Dagukou, on the ocean, there is a group of fearless people fighting against the wind and waves, striving to overfulfill the national plan even more. They are the one hundred and sixty-eight stevedores of the Tianjin District Port Authority.

Tonight, the sky over the sea is bright with stars, the moonlight is bright, and the lighthouse at Dagukou is shining. Three merchant ships from Europe and Japan, as well as ten tugboats, barges, and worker rest ships from this port, are lined up on the sea, brightly lit, forming a city that never sleeps on the sea.

At midnight, the workers began to work, and the hoisting machines on the big ships and barges roared together. In the minus 10 degree Celsius cold, the workers loading cargo in the holds took off all their leather and cotton coats, and were still sweating in their single layers of clothing. They shoveled a bag of bulk salt or loaded a bag of jute almost every thirty seconds. The annoying sea wind and waves pushed the barges back and forth like a cradle, and some workers were seasick, but they still worked so well. When a wave splashed into the hold and splashed water on someone's head, the workers immediately burst into hearty laughter.

At eight o'clock in the morning, a shift was over, and the workers came down to rest. The entire eighth team, which had won the glorious title of Advanced Group, held a "post-ship meeting" and unanimously agreed to write a letter of determination, requesting the leadership to approve them to work another shift today.

Tonight at 9:00 p.m., the Bohai Bay became calm, and the last merchant ship of Tianjin Port's first five-year plan, fully loaded with cargo, sailed away from the coast.

    大沽口外不夜之城
    在大沽口外的海洋上，有着一批无畏的人们同风浪搏斗着，争取更多地超额完成国家计划。他们是天津区港务管理局的一百六十八个装卸工人。
    今夜，海上的天空星光灿烂，月色皎洁，大沽口的灯塔闪烁着光芒。来自欧洲和日本的三艘商船以及本港的十艘拖轮、驳船、工人休息船，排开在海面上，灯火通明，形成了海上的不夜之城。
    午夜零点，工人们开始工作，大船上和驳船上的起重机器一起轰鸣起来。在那零下十一度的严寒中，舱口装货的工人都脱去了所有的皮衣、棉衣，只剩下一身单装还是汗流浃背。他们差不多每三十秒钟就铲好一包散装的食盐或装好一包洋麻子。讨厌的海风海浪把驳船推动得像摇篮似地荡来荡去，有些工人晕了，但是他们依然劳动得那么好。当一个浪花打进舱来，把某一人的头上溅泼上水的时候，工人们立即发出一阵爽朗的笑声。
    到早晨八点，一个班工作完了，工人们下来休息。曾经获得先进小组光荣称号的第八队全体工人开了个“船后会”，一致同意写了决心书，要求领导批准他们今天再作一班活。
    今天晚上二十一点，渤海湾变得风平浪静，天津港第一个五年计划的最后一艘商船满载货物，驶离了海岸。
