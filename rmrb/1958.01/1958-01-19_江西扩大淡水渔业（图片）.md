Jiangxi Expands Freshwater Fisheries

Jiangxi is a province with many mountains and abundant water resources. The province has over 20 million mu of land that can be used for fishing regularly, and 3.5 million mu that can be utilized for fish farming. Last year, only 500,000 mu were used for fish farming, and this year the plan is to expand the utilized water area to 1.2 million mu. The picture below shows the grand fishing scene at Xia Si Tan in Yu Gan County on the day the fishing season opened. On this day, there were thousands of fishing boats, a sea of people, and a lively atmosphere. A single fishing haul yielded 200,000 jin.

    江西扩大淡水渔业
    江西是一个山多水多的地方，全省可以经常捕鱼的面积有二千多万亩，可利用养鱼的面积有三百五十万亩。去年养鱼只利用五十万亩，今年计划扩大利用的水面为一百二十万亩。下图是余干县下四潭在开港这一天的捕鱼盛况。这一天渔船千只，人山人海，热闹非凡，一次捕鱼就达二十万斤。　新华社记者  漆荒诗摄
