    What is a Landslide?
    In the report on the official opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway on January 2nd, this newspaper mentioned several times that the terrain of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is treacherous and the construction is arduous, with many ancient landslides. What is a landslide? A landslide is a mountain slope that is able to slide. We often use "steady as Mount Tai" as an adjective for stability and firmness. Except for earthquakes, people know that mountains do not move. However, when the Baoji-Chengdu Railway passed through the Baishuijiang area, it happened to encounter the problem of mountain slopes moving. The mountains there are saturated with groundwater. The water has long eroded the weathered phyllite layer underground, turning it into a two- or three-meter-thick mud slurry sliding zone. Some mountain slopes stand on these sliding zones. If they lose balance slightly, the mountain slopes will slide. For example, in February 1957, at construction site No. 2 in the Baishuijiang disease engineering area, a section of mountain slope more than 100 meters long facing the railway line slid eight meters towards the railway line all at once. As a result, the roadbed was crushed and the steel rails were bent. The collapsed soil and rocks amounted to tens of thousands of cubic meters, and train traffic was temporarily interrupted. These problems have been successfully solved by the heroic railway construction workers.

    什么叫滑坡？
    本报1月2日关于宝成铁路正式通车的报道中，好几处提到宝成铁路地形险恶，工程艰巨，有许多古老的滑坡。什么叫滑坡呢？滑坡就是能够滑动的山坡。我们常用“稳如泰山”作为稳固坚定的形容词，除了地震以外，人们都知道山是不会走动的，可是宝成铁路经过白水江一带时，恰巧就碰上了山坡走动的难题。那里的山中饱含着地下水。水长期浸蚀着地下风化的千枚岩层，变成一个二、三公尺厚的泥浆滑动带，有的山坡就立在这些滑动带上，稍一失去平衡，山坡就会滑动起来。例如1957年2月份在白水江病害工程区二号工地上，面临铁路线一百多公尺长的一片山坡，一下子就向铁路线方向滑动了八公尺。结果路基被压垮了，钢轨被撞弯了；滑坍的土石就有几万立方公尺，火车也暂时中断了行驶。这些难题，英勇的修路职工都已胜利解决了。
