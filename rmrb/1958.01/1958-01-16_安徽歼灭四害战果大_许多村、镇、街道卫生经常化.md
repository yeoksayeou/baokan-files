Great Achievements in Anhui's Elimination of the Four Pests
Hygiene Becomes Regular in Many Villages, Towns, and Streets

(Reported by this newspaper) The winter patriotic health campaign in Anhui Province, centered on eliminating the four pests, has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics from sixty-two counties and cities from November 1st to the end of December last year, more than 5.8 million rats and sparrows have been caught, more than 360,000 *jin* of mosquitoes, flies, maggots, and pupae have been exterminated, and more than 160 million *dan* of garbage has been removed for fertilizer. In thirteen counties and cities, including Bengbu, Hefei, and Jieshou, 146 agricultural cooperatives, villages, market towns, residential committees, and organizations have basically eliminated the four pests. Among them, Yangxiaozhai in Jieshou County, Niankouji in Shou County, the fourth and sixth electoral districts of Chengguan in Xuancheng, the eastern district of Chengguan in Su County, and Miaojie in Hefei City have persisted in regular hygiene and pest control work for five years. In the urban areas of six cities across the province, daily cleaning has been achieved, and cleanliness is regularly maintained. The weekly major cleaning system in government offices, schools, and organizations, and the residential hygiene duty system in various counties and cities have become regularized. Many factories and mines have consistently implemented the cleaning handover system, greatly improving the environmental sanitation of these factories and mines' work and residential locations. Many agricultural cooperatives have established periodic cleaning systems or patriotic health days, ensuring that people have toilets and pigs and sheep have pens.

Party and government leaders at all levels in Anhui Province attach great importance to this work. Vice Governor Lu Xuebin is responsible for leading the province's pest control work. Gui Linqi, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Lu Xuebin, among others, personally participated in the major health inspection in Hefei City. Patriotic Health Campaign Committees and Pest Control Headquarters have been established in various counties and cities, led by the responsible comrades of the county and city Party and government, effectively promoting this work.
