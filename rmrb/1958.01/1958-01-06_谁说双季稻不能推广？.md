Who Says Double-Cropping Rice Cannot Be Promoted?
By Our Correspondent Yu Feng, Yu Ming

Anqing Prefecture in Anhui Province, implementing the "Three Reforms" method proposed by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, has increased grain production by more than 1.17 billion jin in the past three years from the promotion of double-cropping rice alone. This fact proves that promoting double-cropping rice is a good way to substantially increase rice production in rice-producing areas.

Anqing Prefecture spans the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. The entire region mainly produces rice, with more than 4.62 million mu of paddy fields, of which 19% are in polder areas, and the rest are distributed in mountainous and hilly areas. In order to increase grain production, in 1953, Anqing Prefecture adopted measures to expand the area of wheat cultivation and increase the planting of late autumn crops such as buckwheat or velvet beans. However, wheat production increased by a maximum of only 20 to 30 jin per mu, and the yields of buckwheat and velvet beans were only a few dozen jin per mu. Therefore, after three years of implementation, although the area of multiple cropping was expanded, grain production did not increase significantly. In 1955, Tongcheng County began multi-point trials to promote double-cropping rice on ten thousand mu; after success, it was promoted on a large scale. By 1957, double-cropping rice was planted on 320,000 mu, accounting for 50% of the paddy field area, with an average yield of 768 jin per mu, which was 283 jin more than the average yield of single-season rice per mu. In 1957, the county's multiple cropping area expanded to 201%, and the average grain yield per mu increased to 656 jin, an increase of 138 jin compared with the average yield of 1955, and the total output increased by 87 million jin compared with 1955. Eight townships and forty-eight cooperatives in the county already had an average yield of 800 jin per mu. This proves that double-cropping rice has high yields and rapid production increases. The situation in the entire prefecture is similar. In 1956, double-cropping rice was promoted on 1.99 million mu in the entire prefecture, increasing grain production by more than 400 million jin in one year.

The experience of Anqing Prefecture in promoting double-cropping rice proves that double-cropping rice not only has high yields and large increases in production, but also can avoid disasters and ensure harvests. The rainy season in Anqing Prefecture is mostly concentrated in June and July. The paddy fields in the polder areas are the best, but they are also the most vulnerable to waterlogging. Therefore, farmers in the polder areas are most afraid of heavy rain in June and July. They say, "Polder fields are easy to cultivate, but May (lunar calendar) is difficult to get through," because at this time, the single-season rice in the polder area is in the tillering stage and cannot withstand waterlogging. Waterlogging will reduce production or even result in no harvest. With double-cropping rice, the early rice is half a month to twenty days earlier than the single-season rice. At this time, the rice has grown tall and is no longer afraid of waterlogging. After the early rice is harvested, the water also recedes, which is just right for planting late rice. Double-cropping early rice can not only avoid waterlogging disasters, but also avoid drought disasters. In July 1955, the hilly areas of Huaining County suffered from autumn drought. At this time, the single-season rice was heading and flowering, and production was reduced due to drought, while the double-cropping early rice was already mature and ready to be harvested. If there is a shortage of water after the early rice is harvested, high-yielding drought-resistant crops such as autumn corn can still be planted. In addition, since the maturity period of double-cropping early rice is earlier than that of single-season rice, it can solve the problem of summer grain shortage. The farmers in Anqing Prefecture have personally seen the benefits of double-cropping rice. They say, "Double-cropping rice is really good, with more grain and more straw, avoiding disasters and harvesting early, improving living standards, and making production more energetic."

In the process of promoting double-cropping rice, Anqing Prefecture waged a difficult struggle against right-leaning conservative ideas and solved many practical problems at the same time. The first problem encountered was whether the climate of Anqing Prefecture was suitable for the growth of double-cropping rice. Some people said that the frost-free period for double-cropping rice should be 300 days, and the temperature during the sowing period should be 25°C to be considered safe, otherwise it would be reckless. But the facts have proved that double-cropping rice only needs a frost-free period of 210 to 220 days. Sowing before Qingming, transplanting before the Beginning of Summer, and harvesting around the Frost's Descent, the two seasons only take seven months. The frost-free period in Anqing Prefecture is 240 to 250 days, which is just right for planting double-cropping rice. The average annual temperature in the entire prefecture is 16°C-17°C, which is also suitable for the growth of double-cropping rice. The problem to be solved is: once the Autumnal Equinox has passed, the climate is unstable. At this time, the late rice is heading and flowering. If it encounters cold air and dew, it will affect the yield. Therefore, it is necessary to strive for early transplanting and early harvesting of early rice so that the flowering period of late rice can be advanced and flowering around the Autumnal Equinox can avoid the invasion of cold air and dew. Anqing Prefecture solved this problem by arranging crop rotations, advancing seedling raising and transplanting, allocating varieties, promoting advanced technologies, and rationally organizing labor.

Another problem is whether there is enough labor. Anqing Prefecture has a large population and little land, with an average of 1.1 mu of paddy fields and 0.5 mu of dry land per person. Assuming that each laborer is responsible for 3 mu of fields, it is possible to promote double-cropping rice on a large scale. But it is undeniable that during the season of rushing to harvest early rice and rush to plant late rice, agricultural work is very intensive, and labor must be well arranged to avoid missing the season. Last year, Tongcheng County planted double-cropping rice on 50% of the paddy field area. They relied on the masses to come up with many ways to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor. First, arrange agricultural work in advance. There is less agricultural work between Lesser Heat and Greater Heat, so do the agricultural work and housework that can be done in advance during the rushing harvest and planting period. Second, do a good job of labor organization in advance, divide the labor groups for different types of work such as cutting wheat and transplanting rice, and implement assembly line operations to improve work efficiency. Third, fully mobilize semi-laborers to undertake agricultural work within their capabilities, reducing the burden on full laborers in this regard. Fourth, organize mutual adjustment and mutual support in terms of manpower and animal power between cooperatives and cooperatives, teams and teams, and different work areas. In addition, improve labor tools, improve work efficiency, do a good job in preventing heatstroke, and allocate agricultural work for sunny and rainy days.

People with right-leaning conservative ideas believe that double-cropping rice requires more fertilizer, and this problem cannot be solved. They argue that if the fields are depleted, production will still not increase, and they use this as an excuse to resist the promotion of double-cropping rice. Anqing Prefecture relied on the masses to find more than 20 ways to accumulate fertilizer, increasing fertilizer and refuting this idea with facts. The amount of fertilizer applied in the entire prefecture increased from an average of five dan of human waste per mu in 1953 to eleven dan last year, and will increase to fourteen dan this year. They will also plant a large amount of green manure and vigorously promote "rotting pits in the fields" and "returning rice straw to the fields." "Rotting pits in the fields" means that when the rice is about to mature, the rice with mud in the corners of the field is moved to the field ridges, and then pits are dug in the gaps in the corners of the field, and the weeds around the field ridges are cut and put into the pits for composting. "Returning rice straw to the fields" means cutting off part of the harvested early rice straw and plowing it into the fields, adding a few jin of gypsum and quick-acting fertilizer. Returning rice straw to the fields as fertilizer for late rice does not affect the amount of rice straw required for feed and fuel, because an extra season of rice is planted. Part of the rice straw from the first season is left, and the rice straw from the second season is added, which can offset the amount of rice straw from the original single-season rice planting. Last year, Anqing Prefecture had 340,000 mu of fields that used the method of "returning rice straw to the fields" for composting, and all were successful. The advantages of "rotting pits in the fields" and "returning rice straw to the fields" are that the source of fertilizer is sufficient, the cost is low, the fertilizer effect is high, and it saves labor, which is very popular among the masses. The masses say, "Manure enriches the fields, year after year; fields enrich the fields, for thousands of years."

During the Second Party Congress of Anhui Province, we visited the secretary of the Anqing Prefectural Committee and several county party secretaries on the issue of promoting double-cropping rice. They unanimously believed that after the promotion of double-cropping rice, production increased rapidly and the living standards of farmers improved. Due to the rapid increase in production, the work of grain procurement is also easy to complete. The grain procurement work in Anqing Prefecture has been completed earlier year by year in recent years. Last year, it was completed one month earlier than the previous year, and it was completed in early November. Last year, all agricultural loans that should have been recovered were basically recovered.

They also mentioned that the production potential of double-cropping rice is very large. As long as the technology is improved, the season is well controlled, and sufficient fertilizer is applied, the yield of early rice can be increased to the yield of single-season rice, or even exceed it, and the yield of late rice can also be increased to the yield of early rice. For example, last year, the average yield of 1,200 mu of early rice in Shihe Cooperative in Tongcheng County was 570 jin, which has exceeded the average yield of 550 jin of single-season rice per mu in the cooperative. In some areas of Huaining County, the yield of late rice has reached more than 500 jin. In addition, rape, March yellow barley or green manure can be planted in the double-cropping rice fields, realizing three crops a year. Xu Shaolin, the first secretary of the Anqing Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that based on the existing experience in Anqing, the entire region will continue to expand double-cropping rice. Xu Shaolin especially mentioned the need to help backward areas. He said: The conditions in the Jiangnan area of Anqing Prefecture are better than those in Jiangbei in all aspects, with more polder fields, which are suitable for planting double-cropping rice; but because the conservative thinking of the leadership has not been completely overcome, the promotion is not as fast as in Jiangbei. In the future, the prefectural committee will provide more assistance to them so that they can catch up with advanced areas as soon as possible. In this way, in the next three or four years, the average grain yield of the entire prefecture can be increased from the current 588 jin to 800 jin.

    谁说双季稻不能推广？
    本报记者　于风　于明
    安徽省安庆专区执行中共安徽省委提出的“三改”办法，最近三年来仅推广双季稻一项就增产粮食十一亿七千多万斤。这个事实证明推广双季稻是稻产区大量增产的一个好办法。
    安庆专区地跨长江南北，全区以产稻为主，有水田四百六十二万余亩，除19％在圩区外，其余都分布在山区和丘陵地区。为了提高粮食产量，1953年安庆专区曾采取扩大小麦面积、增种一季荞麦或泥豆等晚秋作物的增产措施。由于小麦最多每亩增产二、三十斤，荞麦和泥豆的产量每亩也只有几十斤，所以施行三年的结果，复种面积虽然扩大了，粮食增产并不多。1955年，桐城县开始多点试验推广双季稻千万亩；成功后，即进行大面积推广。到1957年种双季稻三十二万亩，占水田面积的50％，每亩产量平均七百六十八斤，比中稻每亩平均产量多了二百八十三斤。1957年全县复种面积扩大到201％，粮食每亩平均产量提高到六百五十六斤，比1955年每亩平均产量增加了一百三十八斤，总产量比1955年增加了八千七百万斤。全县已有八个乡、四十八个社平均亩产量达到八百斤。这证明了种双季稻产量高，增产速度快。全专区的情况也是如此。1956年全专区推广了双季稻一百九十九万亩，一年就增产了四亿多斤粮食。
    安庆专区推广双季稻的经验证明，双季稻不仅产量高，增产幅度大，而且还能避灾保收。安庆专区的雨季大半集中在6、7月，圩区的水田最好，但也最易受涝，所以圩区农民最怕6、7月下大雨，他们说：“圩田好做，5月（旧历）难过”，因为此时圩区的中稻正在发棵，经不住涝，一涝就减产甚至无收。种了双季稻，早稻比中稻要早半月到二十天，此时稻已长高，不再怕涝。早稻收割后，水也退了，正好种晚稻。双季早稻不仅能避涝灾，也能避旱灾。1955年7月怀宁县丘陵区遭受秋旱，这时中稻正抽穗扬花，都因受旱减产，而双季早稻则已成熟待割了。早稻收割后如果缺水，仍可改种秋玉米等旱粮高产作物。此外，由于双季早稻成熟期比中稻早，可以解决夏荒问题。安庆专区的农民亲眼看到了双季稻的好处，他们说：“双季稻真正好，多收粮食多收草，避开灾害收割早，生活有改善，生产有劲搞”。
    安庆专区在推广双季稻的工作当中，曾和右倾保守思想进行了艰苦斗争，同时解决了许多实际问题。首先碰到的，是安庆专区的气候是否适合双季稻生长的问题。有人说，双季稻的无霜期要三百天，播种期间的温度要25℃才算安全，不然就是蛮干。但事实证明双季稻只要二百一十天到二百二十天的无霜期就够了。清明前播种，立夏前插秧，霜降左右就收割，两季前后只要七个月。安庆专区的无霜期有二百四十天到二百五十天，正适合种双季稻。全专区每年平均温度是16℃—17℃，也适合于双季稻的生长。要解决的问题是：秋分一过，气候不稳定，晚稻此时正抽穗扬花，若遇寒潮冷露就会影响产量，因此必须争取早稻早插早收，使晚稻的扬花期提前一些，在秋分前后扬花就可避开寒潮冷露的侵袭。安庆专区从安排茬口、提早育秧插秧、调配品种、推广先进技术、合理组织劳力等方面解决了这个问题。
    再一个是劳力够不够的问题。安庆专区人多地少，每人平均有田一点一亩，地五分，每个劳力以承担三亩田来算，是可以大面积推广双季稻的。但也不可否认，在抢收早稻抢种晚稻时节，农活是很紧张的，必须很好安排劳力才能不误季节。桐城县去年种了占水田面积50％的双季稻，他们依靠群众想出很多办法来解决劳力不足的困难。一是提早安排农活。小暑到大暑期间的农活少，就把能在抢收抢种期提前做的农活和家事提前做。二是事先搞好劳动组织，划分割麦、插秧等不同工种的劳动小组，实行流水作业，提高工作效率。三是充分发动半劳力担任他们能力所及的农活，减轻全劳力在这方面的负担。四是组织社与社、队与队、不同作业区在人畜力方面互相调剂互相支援。此外，还改善劳动工具，提高工作效率，做好防暑工作和分配好晴雨天的农活。
    有右倾保守思想的人，认为双季稻所需的肥料较多，这个问题不能解决，拖瘦了田还是不能增产，他们借此来抵制推广双季稻。安庆专区依靠群众找出了二十几种积肥办法，增加了肥料，以事实批驳了这种思想。全专区施肥量从1953年每亩平均五担人粪增加到去年的十一担，今年还要增加到十四担。他们还要大量种植绿肥，大力推广“田头烂窖”、“稻草还田”等办法。“田头烂窖”是在稻子快成熟时，把田角上的稻子带泥移到田埂上，然后在田角空隙处挖窖，砍除田埂四周的杂草放窖内沤肥。“稻草还田”是把收割的一部分早稻草截断犁在田内，再加几斤石膏和速效肥。稻草还田作晚稻肥料，并不影响饲料和燃料所需稻草的数量，因为多种了一季稻子，第一季的稻草还留下一部分，加上第二季的稻草，就能抵上原来种一季中稻的稻草数量。安庆专区去年有三十四万亩田采用“稻草还田”的办法沤肥已全部成功。“田头烂窖”和“稻草还田”的好处是肥源足，成本低，肥效高，省工，很受群众欢迎。群众说：“粪兴田，年管年；田兴田，万万年。”
    在安徽省第二次党代表会议期间，我们就推广双季稻问题访问了安庆地委书记和几个县委书记，他们一致认为推广双季稻以后，增产快，农民生活有改善。由于增产快，征购粮工作也容易完成。安庆专区的粮食征购工作，最近几年一年比一年完成的早，去年比前年又提前一个月，在11月初就完成了。去年应收的各项农业贷款也都基本收清。
    他们还谈到：双季稻的增产潜力很大，只要提高技术，掌握好季节，施足肥料，早稻产量可以提高到中稻产量，甚至可以超过，晚稻产量也可以提高到早稻产量。如去年桐城县石河社有一千二百亩早稻的平均产量为五百七十斤，已超过该社每亩平均五百五十斤的中稻产量。怀宁县有些地区的晚稻产量已达五百斤以上。此外，双季稻的田里还可以种一季油菜或三月黄大麦或绿肥，实行一年三熟。中共安庆地委第一书记许少林同志说，根据安庆地区已有的经验，全区将继续扩大双季稻。许少林同志特别提到要帮助落后地区。他说：安庆专区江南地区各方面的条件比江北好，圩田多，适宜于种植双季稻；但由于领导上的保守思想没有彻底克服，所以推广的不如江北快，以后地委要多方面帮助他们早日赶上先进地区。这样，在最近三、四年内，全专区粮食平均产量就可以由现在的五百八十八斤提高到八百斤。
