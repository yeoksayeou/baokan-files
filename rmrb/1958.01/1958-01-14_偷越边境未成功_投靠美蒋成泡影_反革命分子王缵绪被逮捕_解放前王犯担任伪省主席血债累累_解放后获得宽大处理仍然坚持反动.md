Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 13th: Counter-revolutionary element Wang Zuanxu, who once served as "Commander of the 6th Route Army for Suppressing Communists" and puppet "Chairman of Sichuan Province", etc., fled from Chengdu to Shenzhen last November and was captured by our border troops while attempting to cross the border. The criminal Wang has now been escorted back to Chengdu and is being interrogated by the public security department.

Counter-revolutionary element Wang Zuanxu was originally a specially invited member of the Sichuan Provincial CPPCC and a member of the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee Counselor's Office. On October 20th last year, under the pretext of "seeking medical treatment," he went from Chengdu to Chongqing under the assumed name of Zhang Zhengyan. Together with counter-revolutionary element Lei Shaoheng, who had previously served as the Director of the Chengdu Municipal Public Security Bureau under the puppet regime, they traveled via Wuhan and Guangzhou, arriving at the Shenzhen border on November 15th. At 9:00 PM that night, Wang and others sneaked to the Wenjindu port and attempted to cross the border. At that time, criminal Wang Zuanxu mistakenly believed that the crossing had "succeeded." He was excitedly directing criminal Lei Shaoheng to "lie down" and "run fast" when he was apprehended by our border troops. On the spot, 30 volumes, totaling over 520,000 words, of counter-revolutionary declarations and reactionary poems personally written by criminal Wang were seized, as well as 51 clippings related to the international situation and the domestic anti-rightist struggle, and US$400 as evidence of his crimes.

The seized counter-revolutionary declarations and reactionary poems written by criminal Wang proved his long-standing conspiracy against the Soviet Union, against the Communist Party, against the people, and his plot to seek refuge with the US-Chiang Kai-shek clique and realize a counter-revolutionary restoration. In his counter-revolutionary declaration, he wrote: "Before the so-called liberation, I did not go to Taiwan with the Kuomintang, first, because I wanted to save my hometown from decay, and second, because I wanted to take the opportunity to improve (change) some of their blindly following (people). In an emergency, I hope to enter the Songpan, Li County, Mao County border area alone to await opportunities" ("Songpan, Li County, Mao County border area" refers to the border area of Songpan, Li County, and Mao County, all within the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province). After liberation, criminal Wang actively colluded with counter-revolutionary elements to carry out secret activities, attempting to incite the masses to resist the government; at the same time, he collected materials from all aspects of the Communist Party and the government, fabricating rumors and slanders to the best of his ability, and compiled counter-revolutionary documents. In his more than 520,000-word counter-revolutionary documents, criminal Wang maliciously slandered rent reduction and deposit refunds, suppression of bandits and local bullies, land reform, resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, the elimination of counter-revolutionary elements, and the socialist transformation and socialist construction carried out by the state. He even cursed the measures such as writing reform, currency reform, and transportation reform. Criminal Wang hurled abuse and slander at people's leaders, democratic figures, cadres, activists, and heroic models. Criminal Wang also systematically put forward a complete set of counter-revolutionary restoration plans in his counter-revolutionary documents. According to his confession, after successfully crossing the border, he would print and distribute the counter-revolutionary documents he had prepared in large quantities, attempting to stir up an international anti-Soviet and anti-Communist upsurge, and then cooperate with Chiang Kai-shek's "counter-attack on the mainland" to subvert our people's democratic regime.

Before liberation, in addition to serving as "Commander of the 6th Route Army for Suppressing Communists" and "Chairman of Sichuan Province," criminal Wang Zuanxu also held reactionary positions such as "Commander-in-Chief of the 29th Army Group," "Chiang Kai-shek's Chongqing Garrison Commander," "Deputy Commander of the Southwest Military and Political Office," and "Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest First Route Guerrilla Force." He was a counter-revolutionary element with countless blood debts and long-term anti-Communist and anti-people activities. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, criminal Wang brutally massacred a large number of our anti-Japanese soldiers. During his tenure as the puppet Chairman of Sichuan Province, he once bought off thugs and attempted to assassinate the late Chairman of the China Democratic League, Zhang Lan, and actively sabotaged the democratic movement. Criminal Wang was also a special agent of the "Revival Society." He had appointed a large number of members of the Revival Society and the CC clique, directly helping Chiang Kai-shek to rule and suppress the people of Sichuan with secret service and police methods.

After liberation, the People's Government treated criminal Wang with leniency, not holding him accountable for his past deeds, and giving him a certain status. However, criminal Wang's counter-revolutionary nature did not change in the slightest. He stubbornly opposed the people, betrayed the motherland, and cut himself off from the people.

### 偷越边境未成功　投靠美蒋成泡影  反革命分子王缵绪被逮捕  解放前王犯担任伪省主席血债累累  解放后获得宽大处理仍然坚持反动

    偷越边境未成功　投靠美蒋成泡影
    反革命分子王缵绪被逮捕
    解放前王犯担任伪省主席血债累累
    解放后获得宽大处理仍然坚持反动
    新华社成都13日电　曾经担任“剿共第六路司令”、伪“四川省主席”等反动职务的反革命分子王缵绪，去年11月由成都潜逃到深圳，在偷越边境时被我边防军捕获。现王犯已被押回成都，正由公安部门审讯中。
    反革命分子王缵绪原为四川省政协特邀委员、四川省人民委员会参事室参事。去年10月20日，他假借“治病”为由，从成都到重庆后化名张正言，和早年曾任伪成都市公安局局长的反革命分子雷绍丞一道，经武汉、广州，在11月15日到达深圳边境。当夜九时，王犯等潜至文锦渡口，偷越边境。当时，王犯缵绪自以为偷越已经“成功”，当他正兴奋地指挥雷犯绍丞“卧倒”、“快跑”的时候，即被我边防军捉住，并当场查出王犯亲笔书写的反革命宣言、反动诗词等共三十本，约五十二万多字，还查出有关国际局势和国内反右派斗争的剪报五十一份等罪证及美金四百元。
    被查获的王犯所写的反革命宣言及反动诗词，证明了王犯蓄谋已久的反苏、反共、反人民及企图投靠美蒋集团、实现反革命复辟的阴谋。他在反革命宣言中写道：“我在所谓解放前，未随国民党赴台者，一想挽救桑梓糜烂，二想伺机改善（变）他们一部（分）盲从（者），情况紧急时我望单独进入松、理、茂边地，以待机会”（“松、理、茂边地”，指松潘、理县、茂县三县边地，都在四川省阿坝藏族自治州）。王犯在解放后一面积极勾结反革命分子进行秘密活动，企图煽起群众反抗政府；一面搜集共产党和政府各方面的材料，极尽造谣污蔑之能事，编成反革命文件。王犯在其五十二万多字的反革命文件中，对减租退押、清匪反霸、土地改革、抗美援朝、三反五反、肃清反革命分子，以及国家进行的社会主义改造和社会主义建设等，都作了恶毒的诬蔑。甚至对文字改革、币制改革、交通改革等措施，也无一不恣意咒骂。王犯对于人民领袖、民主人士、干部、积极分子、英雄模范，更是百般辱骂和诋毁。王犯还在其反革命文件中，有纲领、有计划地提出了一整套反革命复辟的方案。据他供认，在越境成功后，就要大量印刷散发他准备的反革命文件，企图掀起国际反苏反共高潮，然后配合蒋介石“反攻大陆”，颠覆我人民民主政权。
    王犯缵绪在解放前除担任过“剿共第六路司令”、“四川省主席”等反动职务外，还历任“二十九集团军总司令”、“蒋介石重庆卫戍总司令”、“西南长官公署副长官”、“西南第一路游击总司令”等反动职务，是一个血债累累、长期反共反人民的反革命分子。王犯在抗日战争期间，曾经残暴地屠杀过大批我抗日士兵；在任伪四川省主席时期，曾收买流氓打手，企图暗杀已故民盟主席张澜，并积极破坏民主运动。王犯还是一个“复兴社”的特务分子，他曾大量任用复兴社和CC分子，直接帮助蒋介石用特务警察手段统治、镇压四川人民。
    解放后人民政府对王犯宽大为怀，不究既往，并给他一定地位。但王犯反革命本质丝毫未变，竟坚决同人民为敌，背叛祖国，自绝于人民。
