Your Excellency Chargé d'Affaires Sha Lan, Your Royal Highness Crown Prince Seif el-Islam Mohammed al-Badr, ladies and gentlemen:

    I am very pleased to have the opportunity to attend the Egyptian Ambassador's reception yesterday and the Syrian Chargé d'Affaires' reception today during the visit of Crown Prince Badr to China, which will enable us to forge a better friendship among the three Arab countries.

    The people of the Arab countries have not only awakened, but are also standing on the western forefront of the struggle against colonialism. Yemen, Egypt, and Syria have shown particular resolve in this heroic anti-colonialist struggle. This heroic and just struggle has aroused the deep respect of the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries.

    Just now, Your Excellency Chargé d'Affaires mentioned the Chinese people's support for the anti-colonial struggle of the Arab peoples. I think this support is insignificant compared to the heavy responsibility borne by the Arab peoples on the western front of the anti-colonial struggle. We, the Chinese people and the Asian people who oppose colonialism, greatly admire the heroic anti-colonial struggle of the Arab peoples, and we should actively support you. Unfortunately, our support has not been enough, and we will provide even more support in the future to thank you.

    The foreign envoys present today are all envoys from Asian and African countries, that is, representatives of Asian and African countries. This makes us feel as if the representatives of the Bandung Conference are meeting here again today. And the representatives of Asian and African countries who did not have the opportunity to attend the Bandung Conference also participated in the Cairo Conference not long ago, and today they are gathering here with us. This shows that the spirit of the Bandung Conference has developed into the spirit of the Cairo Conference. The spirit of the Bandung Conference and the Cairo Conference is developing day by day, and its influence is expanding day by day. I believe that the spirit of the Bandung Conference and the Cairo Conference will surely guarantee greater victories for the struggle of peace-loving people around the world for peace, against colonialism, and for the friendship of all peoples.

    I propose a toast:

    To the victory of the struggle of the Arab peoples,
    To the friendship of the peoples of Asia and Africa,
    To the friendship of the peoples of the world,
    To world peace,
    To the health of His Excellency President Kuwatly of Syria,
    To the health of His Excellency Prime Minister al-Asali of Syria,
    To the health of His Majesty Imam Ahmad of the Kingdom of Yemen,
    To the health of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Seif el-Islam Mohammed al-Badr of the Kingdom of Yemen,
    To the health of His Excellency President Nasser of Egypt,
    To the health of the host of today's banquet – Chargé d'Affaires Sha Lan,
    Cheers!

    周恩来总理的讲话
    尊贵的沙蓝代办阁下，尊敬的塞弗·伊斯兰·穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下，女士们，先生们：
    我很高兴在巴德尔王太子殿下访问中国的期间，能有机会在昨天参加埃及大使的招待会，今天又参加叙利亚代办的招待会，能够使我们在阿拉伯三个国家之间，结成更好的友谊。
    阿拉伯各国人民不仅已经觉醒起来，而且正站在反殖民主义斗争的西方的最前线。在这种英勇的反对殖民主义的斗争中，也门、埃及和叙利亚表现得特别坚决。这种英勇的正义斗争，引起了中国人民和亚洲各国人民的深深敬意。
    刚才代办阁下曾提到中国人民对阿拉伯各国人民反殖民主义斗争的支持。我想，比起阿拉伯各国人民在西方反殖民主义最前线所担负的重任来说，这种支持是微不足道的。我们中国人民和反对殖民主义的亚洲人民，非常钦佩阿拉伯各国人民反殖民主义的英勇斗争，我们应该积极支持你们。可惜，我们的支持还做得不够，我们今后还要支持得更多，以此来答谢你们。
    今天到会的各国使节都是亚非国家的使节，也就是亚非各国的代表。这使我们感到，就好像万隆会议的代表今天再一次在这里会面了。而没有机会参加万隆会议的亚非国家的代表，在不久前也参加了开罗会议，今天他们也在这里和我们相聚了。这就说明，万隆会议的精神发展成为开罗会议的精神。万隆会议和开罗会议的精神，正在一天天地发展，它们的影响正在一天天地扩大。我相信，万隆会议和开罗会议的精神，一定会保证世界各国爱好和平的人民为了和平、为了反殖民主义和为了各国人民的友好而进行的斗争，取得更大的胜利。
    我提议：
    为阿拉伯各国人民斗争的胜利，
    为亚非各国人民的友好，
    为世界各国人民的友好，
    为世界和平，
    为叙利亚总统库阿特利阁下的健康，
    为叙利亚总理阿萨利阁下的健康，
    为也门王国伊玛姆·艾哈迈德陛下的健康，
    为也门王国塞弗·伊斯兰·穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下的健康，
    为埃及总统纳赛尔阁下的健康，
    为今天宴会的主人——沙蓝代办的健康，
    干杯！
