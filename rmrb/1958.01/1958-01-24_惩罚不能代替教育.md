Punishment Cannot Replace Education
Xiaotong

The discipline in some middle schools is very poor. During the rectification campaign, many teachers criticized this phenomenon. However, teachers have two attitudes on how to change this situation: one is to patiently persuade and educate, and cultivate students' conscious observance of discipline; the other is to be rigid and rude, attempting to subdue students through administrative means.

If you were to ask which attitude teachers should adopt, anyone would say the former. However, in reality, some teachers are either helpless in the face of so-called "chaotic classes" or "naughty" students, or they cannot deal with them calmly. Some teachers emphasize using punishment to subdue students. In one school, I saw a big-character poster written by several teachers titled "Cutting the Gordian Knot," which said:

	"Discipline issues are as big as a mountain,
	Urgent rectification brooks no delay,
	If you ask for a panacea,
	………………
	Why not cut the Gordian knot quickly.
	Take Wang XX of Class Two Six as an example,
	Consistently naughty and disobedient,
	If we can consider giving him a punishment,
	The merit would be greater than for the whole class."

In school, discipline is one of the important conditions for ensuring the success of education. Without good discipline, it is impossible to ensure that students learn their lessons well. At the same time, discipline is also an important part of communist moral education. Some teachers express indignation at the lax discipline and impolite behavior of students, and this feeling is easy to understand. However, in solving this problem, we should not overemphasize the effectiveness of "punishment," but should focus on persuasion and education to cultivate students' self-awareness. The reason is simple, because students' discipline should be built on a foundation of self-awareness. Only by raising students' awareness can there be good and solid discipline. Discipline built on coercion is temporary and not solid. The main task of teachers is to enlighten and educate students to consciously abide by discipline, so that students understand that without good discipline, their studies will be affected, the knowledge they learn cannot be well grasped and consolidated, and they will not be able to serve the people well in the future. Only when students understand the importance of discipline can conscious and good discipline be formed. When Beijing No. 14 Middle School rectified school discipline, it focused on conducting ideological education for students, mobilizing all students to discuss and analyze the reasons for the school's poor discipline, and formulating ways to overcome it. Through these mutual criticisms and self-criticisms, students received a good education, and the school's discipline made significant progress in a short period of time.

Poor school discipline has many factors. Among them, the weakness of ideological and political education in schools, inappropriate educational methods for students, and the lack of rich teaching content and poor teaching methods of some teachers are important reasons for the poor discipline in some schools and some classes. Therefore, when rectifying school discipline, it is best to delve deeply into these aspects and discover more shortcomings in education and teaching work, so as to improve school leadership and improve the quality of education.

Of course, persuasion and education are not omnipotent. For those who seriously violate discipline and repeatedly refuse to be corrected, especially a small number of hooligans and bad students, discipline should be enforced and due punishment should be given. Although the number of such students is small, they often have a very bad influence on a school or a class. It is necessary to give necessary punishment to such students. Punishment is an educational method to save these students from the wrong path. However, these students are, after all, a minority, and for the majority of students, persuasion and education are the main methods, and caution should be exercised when enforcing disciplinary actions.

    惩罚不能代替教育
    筱桐
    有些中学的纪律很不好。在整风当中，许多教师对这种现象提出了批评。但是，如何改变这种状况，教师们有两种态度：一种是耐心地说服教育，培养学生自觉遵守纪律；一种是生硬粗暴，企图以行政手段来压服学生。
    如果要问教师应当采取哪种态度，任何人一定会说是前者。然而事实上，有些教师在所谓“乱班”，或者是在“调皮”的学生面前，不是束手无策，就是不能冷静对待，有的教师则强调以处分压服学生。我在一所学校里看到几位教师写的一张题为“快刀斩乱麻”的大字报，说：
      “纪律问题大如山，
        急需整顿莫迟延，
        若问仙丹和妙药，
        ………………
        何妨快刀斩乱麻。
        比如二六王××，
        一贯顽皮不服管，
        若能考虑给处分，
        功莫大于在全班”。
    在学校里，纪律是保证教育成功的重要条件之一，没有良好的纪律，就不可能保证学生学好课业，同时，纪律也是共产主义道德教育的重要内容。有些教师对于学校纪律松弛、学生无礼貌等行为表示愤慨，这种心情是容易理解的。但是，在解决这个问题的办法上，不能过分强调“处分”的功效，而应该着重说服教育，培养学生的自觉精神。道理很简单，因为学生的纪律应该建筑在自觉的基础上，只有提高学生觉悟，才能有良好的巩固的纪律。那种建筑在强迫的基础上的纪律是暂时的，不巩固的。教师的主要任务是启发教育学生自觉地遵守纪律，使学生了解如果没有良好的纪律，就会影响学业，所学的知识就不能很好地掌握和巩固，将来就不能很好地为人民服务。只有使学生了解纪律的重要性，自觉的良好的纪律才能形成。北京第十四中学在整顿学校纪律的时候，着重对学生进行思想教育，发动全体学生讨论、分析学校纪律不好的原因，并订出克服的办法。通过这些互相批评和自我批评，学生受到很好的教育，学校纪律在很短的时间内，就有了显著进步。
    学校纪律不好有许多因素，其中学校的思想政治教育薄弱，对学生教育方法不够妥当，以及有的教师教学内容不够丰富、教学方法不好等，是某些学校、某些班纪律不好的重要原因之一。因此，在整饬学校纪律的时候，最好从这些方面深入挖掘，更多地发现教育、教学工作中的缺点，借以改进学校领导工作，提高教育质量。
    当然，说服教育也不是万能的，对于严重违犯纪律而又屡教不改的，特别是少数流氓分子、坏学生，应该执行纪律，给予应得的处分。这类学生人数虽少，但往往对于一个学校、一个班发生极坏的影响。对于这类学生，给予必要的惩罚是必需的，惩罚是一种教育手段，是为了把这种学生从错误的道路上挽救过来。但是，这种学生毕竟是少数的，而对于大多数学生来说主要是说服教育，在执行纪律处分时要慎重。
