Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, January 16th: The Chinese Communist Party's Tibet regional party organization has begun a rectification movement within the party in accordance with the instructions of the CCP Central Committee. Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and some non-Party and non-League cadres in Lhasa listened to a mobilization report on January 14th by Zhang Jingwu, Representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the CCP Tibet Working Committee, regarding the rectification within the Party. Prior to this, the CCP Tibet Working Committee had issued instructions to party organizations at all levels on December 17, 1957, regarding the rectification within the Party and the socialist education of the masses.

In his report, Zhang Jingwu, based on the national situation and the actual situation in Tibet, explained in detail the necessity and significance of carrying out the rectification movement within the Party, as well as the steps involved and the issues that must be paid attention to.

Both the instructions of the CCP Tibet Working Committee and Zhang Jingwu's report emphasized that this rectification movement should deeply oppose bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, and combine this with opposition to Han chauvinism, local nationalism, and individualism, in order to improve work, improve style, transform individuals, strengthen internal party unity, and do a good job in Tibet.

The instructions and report pointed out that, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee over the past eight years, party committees at all levels, all Party members, League members, the People's Liberation Army in Tibet, and local staff, together with the people of Tibet, have made joint efforts and done a lot of work, achieving certain accomplishments in strengthening national unity, consolidating national defense, consolidating national unity, and developing Tibet's politics, economy, and culture. Generally speaking, the achievements are the main aspect. However, the instructions and report also pointed out some shortcomings and mistakes in the work. For example, some party leading organs and leading cadres have, in grasping the situation in Tibet, implementing the central government's policies, and strengthening party unity, developed bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism that is divorced from the masses and reality. The individualism of some Party members and cadres is quite serious, even to the point of corruption, embezzlement, and violation of laws and discipline. Some Han cadres also have serious Han chauvinist ideas. They neglect the important position of the Tibetan people in the socialist construction of the motherland, lack class sympathy for the Tibetan working people, do not conscientiously study and implement the Party's ethnic policies, do not respect the customs and habits of the Tibetan people, are unwilling to do long-term arduous work in Tibet, and their long-term commitment to building Tibet is not yet solid. Among the Tibetan Party cadres, some comrades still have local nationalist tendencies, neglecting the importance of national unity in the motherland's big family, overemphasizing the local interests of their own ethnic group, neglecting the overall interests of the country, and lacking sufficient understanding of the important significance of Han cadres' assistance. They do not yet have a clear understanding that Tibet must take the socialist road to have a future, and they do not fully understand that the development and prosperity of the Tibetan people of Tibet are inseparable from the socialist construction of the motherland. The instructions and report pointed out that the above-mentioned shortcomings, errors, and nationalist tendencies have caused losses to the Party's work.

In its instructions, the CCP Tibet Working Committee demanded that Party organizations at all levels have a firm determination in leading this Party rectification movement, that they should be bold and resolute in encouraging criticism, fully promote democracy, fully mobilize the masses, thoroughly expose the shortcomings and mistakes in their work, and expose various incorrect understandings and unhealthy tendencies among Party members and cadres. The more thorough the exposure, the more conducive it will be to overcoming shortcomings, correcting mistakes, and improving work.

The rectification is expected to last for half a year. Currently, the CCP Tibet Working Committee has established a Rectification Office. The various sub-working committees and work teams will also establish Rectification Offices separately. Various agencies in Lhasa have officially begun studying documents from the 15th to make ideological preparations for the rectification.

    西藏各级党组织开始整风
    新华社拉萨16日电　中国共产党西藏地区党组织按照中共中央指示开始在党内进行整风。拉萨市的共产党员、共青团员和部分非党、团干部，14日听取了中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武关于在党内进行整风的动员报告。在此以前，中共西藏工委曾在1957年12月17日向各级党组织发出关于在党内进行整风和向群众进行社会主义教育的指示。
    张经武在报告中，从全国的形势和目前西藏地区的实际情况，详细说明了在党内进行整风的必要性和重要意义，以及进行步骤和必须注意的问题。
    在中共西藏工委的指示和张经武的报告中都着重指出，这次整风运动，应该是深入地反对官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义，并结合反对大汉族主义、地方民族主义和个人主义，以达到改进工作，改进作风，改造个人，加强党内团结，作好西藏工作的目的。
    指示和报告都指出，八年来在党中央的正确领导下，西藏地区的各级党委、全体党员、团员、进藏人民解放军和地方工作人员，和西藏人民一道，共同努力，做了许多工作，在加强民族团结，巩固祖国国防，巩固祖国统一，发展西藏的政治、经济、文化等方面，都取得了一定的成就。从总的方面来说，成绩是主要的。但是，指示和报告也指出了在工作上存在的一些缺点和错误，例如，有些党的领导机关和领导干部，在掌握西藏情况、贯彻执行中央的方针政策和加强党的团结工作上，脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义有所滋长。有些党员和干部的个人主义相当严重，甚至贪污腐化，违法乱纪。有些汉族干部还有严重的大汉族主义思想，他们忽视西藏人民在祖国社会主义建设事业中的重要地位，对藏族劳动人民缺乏阶级同情心，不认真学习和执行党的民族政策，不尊重西藏人民的风俗习惯，不愿意在西藏做长期的艰苦的工作，长期建藏思想还不巩固。在藏族党员干部中，有些同志还存在着地方民族主义的倾向，忽视民族团结在祖国大家庭中的重要性，过分强调本民族的局部利益，忽视国家的整体利益，对汉族干部帮助的重要意义认识不足，他们对西藏必须走社会主义道路才有前途还没有明确的认识，也还不完全了解西藏藏族人民的发展和繁荣是和祖国的社会主义建设分不开的。指示和报告指出，上述这些缺点、错误和民族主义倾向，已给党的工作带来了损失。
    中共西藏工委在指示中要求各级党组织，对这次党内整风运动，领导上要有坚强的决心，要大胆地放，坚决地放，彻底地放，充分发扬民主，充分发动群众，彻底揭发工作中的缺点错误，暴露党员干部中的各种不正确的认识和各种不良的倾向，越是放得彻底，对克服缺点，纠正错误，改进工作越有利。
    整风预计进行半年。现在，中共西藏工委已成立整风办公室。各分工委、工作队也将分别成立整风办公室。拉萨各机关，从15日起已正式开始学习文件，做好整风的思想准备。
