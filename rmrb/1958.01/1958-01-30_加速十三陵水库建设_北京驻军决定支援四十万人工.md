Xinhua News Agency, January 28th – The People’s Liberation Army stationed in Beijing has decided to support the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, the largest water conservancy project in the Beijing suburbs, with 400,000 labor days over the next three months. This decision was made at a joint meeting convened today by the General Political Department, attended by the heads of various military branches, services, departments, and schools stationed in Beijing.

	General Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, said at the meeting that the relevant departments in Beijing Municipality have requested the Beijing-stationed troops to support the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir in the suburbs with 400,000 labor days. We should actively and enthusiastically accept this task, mobilize the vast numbers of officers and soldiers to fully promote revolutionary vigor, and work with the local people to successfully complete the reservoir construction project, supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production.

	The heads of the Beijing-stationed troops launched a wave of voluntarily reporting the number of workdays at the meeting, and immediately established a committee headed by Major General Luo Wenfang to support the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction project by the Beijing-stationed troops. The heads of many units repeatedly calculated manpower, tapped potential, and repeatedly increased the number of workdays at the meeting, striving to contribute more to the water conservancy of the Beijing suburbs.

	The Ming Tombs Reservoir is located at the eastern entrance of the Ming Tombs in the suburbs of Beijing. After completion, it will be able to store 66 million cubic meters of water and irrigate 250,000 to 300,000 mu of land. It can also greatly reduce water and flood disasters on both sides of the Wenyu River. The main project of this reservoir is to build a large flood control dam, 600 meters long, 160 meters wide at the bottom, 8 meters wide at the top, and 30 meters high, between two mountain peaks to store water in a natural large mountain ring. The earthwork of the dam is more than 1.8 million cubic meters, and the troops are responsible for 200,000 cubic meters. Efforts will be made to basically complete the entire project before the flood season.

    加速十三陵水库建设
    北京驻军决定支援四十万人工
    新华社28日讯　中国人民解放军驻北京部队决定在今后的三个多月内，以四十万劳动日支援京郊最大的水利工程——十三陵水库的建设。这是今天总政治部召集的驻北京各军种兵种部队、机关、学校的首长联席会议上决定的。
    总政治部副主任甘泗淇上将在会上说，北京市有关部门要求驻京部队以四十万劳动日支援郊区十三陵水库的建设。我们应该积极地热情地接受这一任务，动员广大官兵充分发扬革命干劲，和当地人民一起圆满地完成水库建设工程，支援农业生产大跃进。
    驻京各部队首长在会上掀起了自报出工人数的热潮，并且当场成立了以罗文坊少将为首的驻京部队支援十三陵水库建设工程的委员会。不少单位的首长在会上一再计算人力，挖掘潜力，多次增加出工人数，争取为京郊水利化多尽一分力。
    十三陵水库位于京郊十三陵东山口。建成后，能够蓄水六千六百万公方，浇地二十五万到三十万亩。还能大大减少温榆河两岸的水、涝灾害。这个水库的主要工程是要在两个山头之间筑起一条长六百公尺、底宽一百六十公尺、顶宽八公尺、高三十公尺的大拦洪坝来把水蓄在一个天然的大山环里。大坝土方工程共有一百八十多万方，部队负责二十万方。全部工程争取在汛期前基本完工。
