    Zhejiang Province Achieves Unimpeded Waterway Transportation
    (By our reporter) Zhejiang Province's shipping departments are vigorously developing mountain waterways to support agricultural production. Since the draft outline of the agricultural development program was announced, the province has newly opened and renovated 117 waterways, and the mileage navigable by steamboats and wooden boats has reached 7,133 kilometers, which is three and a half times that before liberation.
    Now, except for Taishun and Wencheng counties, all of the other 80+ counties and cities in the province can be accessed by ships or bamboo rafts. A dense network of waterways has connected all the cities, towns, and villages of the province. After the development of a five-kilometer waterway section in Xianbekeng, Shanchuan Township, Lin'an County, the township's abundant moso bamboo can be transported directly to Yuhang by water. In 1956 alone, over 7.5 million bamboo poles were transferred out by water transportation. Compared to the method of climbing dozens of miles of mountain roads and then transferring to water transportation, it saved more than 28,000 yuan in transportation costs and could increase farmers' income by more than 30,000 yuan.

    浙江全境水路畅通
    本报讯　浙江省航运部门大力开发山区航道，支援农业生产。自从农业发展网要草案公布以来，全省新开和整修航道一百一十七条，轮船木船通航里程已达七千一百三十三公里，等于解放前的三倍半。
    现在全省除泰顺、文成两县外，其余八十多个县市都能通行船舶或竹筏。密布的水路纲已经贯通全省大小城镇和乡村。临安县山川乡仙伯坑一段五公里的航道开发以后，使这个乡盛产的毛竹能够由水运直达余杭，仅1956年由水运外调的毛竹就有七百五十多万支，比爬十几里山路后再转水运的办法，节省运费二万八千多元，并且可以使农民增加三万多元的收入。　（于健）
