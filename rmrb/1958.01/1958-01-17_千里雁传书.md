    A Thousand Miles, the Wild Goose Carries a Letter
    Zhao Ying
    I hope the southward flying wild geese will land on the warm shores of Dongting Lake!
    Please carry my warm greetings and friendship to my friend who has been sent down there!
    How big has the first row of radishes you planted grown?
    How deep have the first batch of spring buckwheat you sowed grown?
    How much manure has accumulated in the first manure pit you dug?
    How many work points have you recorded in your red record book?
    You bid farewell to the beautiful twilight in the fields,
    And you welcome the golden dawn on the waterwheel!
    You will use the first cotton boll, the first ear of grain,
    To send news of your first harvest from the South!
    How I miss you, my friend!
    But I don't want you to come to Beijing.
    I only hope that I can pack my bags soon,
    And become a glorious farmer with you!

    千里雁传书
    赵瑛但愿南飞的鸿雁，降落在温暖的洞庭湖滨！把我这热忱的问候与友情，带给下放在那里的友人！你种下的第一垅萝卜长了多大？你撒下的第一块春荞长了多深？你挖下的第一个粪坑积了多少粪？你红色的记分簿上记上了多少工分？你在田畦上送走了绮丽的黄昏，又在水车上迎接着金色的黎明！你要用第一瓣棉花、第一根谷穗，从南国传来你第一次丰收的喜讯！我是多么怀念你，我的朋友！可我并不是想要你来到北京。我只盼望我能够早点背上行李，也同你一起去当一个光荣的农民！
