Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 13th - TASS reported from Moscow on January 13th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, wrote letters to Danish Prime Minister H.C. Hansen and Belgian Prime Minister Achille Van Acker, respectively. Enclosed was the "Suggestions by the Soviet Government on Easing International Tensions."

    Bulganin's letter to the Danish Prime Minister was delivered by the Soviet Ambassador to Denmark, Stiven, on the 10th. In the letter, Bulganin stated that we are very pleased to note that the Danish government, like the governments of many other Western countries, agrees with the Soviet government's proposal in past letters to hold talks between national leaders to resolve pressing international issues. We are equally pleased to learn of your and the Norwegian government's heads of state declaration that Denmark and Norway refuse to deploy nuclear weapons and medium-range rocket launchers on their territories. The decisions taken by Denmark and Norway on this important issue are welcome and contribute to the cause of peace, especially to easing the situation in Europe.

    Bulganin also pointed out in the letter that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) recently adopted resolutions at its latest meeting to put ballistic missiles under the command of NATO's Supreme Headquarters, establish nuclear warhead stockpiles on the territory of Western European countries, and establish atomic bases and rocket weapon launching sites, and Denmark supported these resolutions at the meeting. Prior to this, Denmark also decided to accept certain types of rocket weapons from the United States to equip its armed forces. Therefore, one cannot help but regret that all means have not been exhausted to turn Northern Europe into a truly peaceful and tranquil region.

    Bulganin hoped that the Danish Prime Minister would carefully study the Soviet government's proposal to convene a high-level meeting of national leaders within the next two or three months and use his influence to promote the convening of this meeting.

    In the letter handed to Belgian Prime Minister Van Acker by the Soviet Embassy in Belgium on the 11th, Bulganin pointed out that the people of all countries are increasingly resolutely demanding that governments end the "Cold War," stop the propaganda of war and the arms race, and create normal conditions for people to live in peace and tranquility. The peace-loving people of Belgium are also making similar demands with increasing determination, as can be seen from the many talks of Belgian social figures and politicians.

    The letter pointed out that the largest trade union organization in Belgium, the General Federation of Belgian Labour, advocates the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the Belgian Socialist Party Congress passed a resolution advocating the consolidation of peace and cooperation between the people of all countries, and the leader of the Belgian Liberal Party parliamentary group, Senator Mouro, made a statement on behalf of the Liberal Party opposing the deployment of nuclear weapons on Belgian territory and opposing the "interdependence theory" of the United States and Britain. These facts are satisfactory.

    When mentioning the Soviet government's proposal to hold a high-level meeting of national leaders, Bulganin said that he hoped that these suggestions would be understood and supported by the Belgian Prime Minister and the government.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, January 13th - TASS reported: Afghan Prime Minister Daud issued a statement at a press conference on the 11th, stating that the Afghan government fully supports the Soviet government's proposal to hold a high-level meeting, which it considers to be a timely and wise step aimed at eliminating international tensions and resolving most issues.

    When talking about the possibility of Afghanistan participating in the high-level meeting proposed by the Soviet Union, he said that if all the relevant countries agree to Afghanistan's participation in this meeting, then it will fulfill its mission with the utmost responsibility.

    The Soviet proposal pointed out that it is appropriate for countries like Afghanistan to participate in the meeting.

    When elaborating on the Afghan government's position on international issues, Prime Minister Daud emphasized that Afghanistan, faithful to the principles of the United Nations, has always supported the policy of peaceful coexistence, and supports policies that create preconditions for universal disarmament; always advocates stopping the arms race, prohibiting the production and testing of nuclear weapons, and destroying existing weapons of this kind, and striving to use new types of power entirely for peaceful purposes. Afghanistan has consistently advocated the conclusion of non-aggression treaties and the prohibition of war; advocates expanding international cooperation, and advocates that governments undertake the obligation to resolve all disputes through peaceful means and within the framework of the United Nations. Prime Minister Daud emphasized that, at present, Afghanistan's foreign policy is still based on these principles.

    布尔加宁写信给丹比两国首相要求响应苏联和平呼吁
    阿富汗首相支持举行高级会议
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁分别写信给丹麦首相汉森和比利时首相范阿克。信中附有“苏联政府关于缓和国际紧张局势问题的建议”。
    布尔加宁给丹麦首相的信是由苏联驻丹麦大使斯提文在10日递交的。布尔加宁在信中说，我们非常满意地注意到，丹麦政府同许多其他西方国家的政府一样，同意苏联政府在过去的信中所提出的各国领导人举行会谈以解决迫切的国际问题的主张。我们同样满意地获悉您和挪威政府首脑关于丹麦和挪威拒绝在本国领土上设置核武器和中程火箭发射装置的声明。丹麦和挪威在这个重要问题上所采取的决定，是值得欢迎的，对和平事业、特别是对缓和欧洲局势作出了一定的贡献。
    布尔加宁在信中同时指出，北大西洋公约组织最近一次会议通过了关于让北大西洋公约组织最高司令部掌握弹道导弹、在西欧国家的领土上建立核弹头储备、原子基地和火箭武器发射场的决议，而丹麦在会上是支持上述决议的。在此以前，丹麦还决定接受美国的某些种类的火箭武器来装备本国军队。因此，人们就不能不遗憾地认为，远没有用尽一切办法把北欧变成真正的和平和安宁的地区。
    布尔加宁希望丹麦首相仔细研究苏联政府关于在最近两三个月内召开国家领导人高级会议的建议，并且利用自己的影响来促使这个会议召开。
    在由苏联驻比利时大使馆11日交给比利时首相范阿克的信中，布尔加宁指出，世界各国人民愈来愈坚决地要求政府终止“冷战”、停止战争和军备竞赛的宣传，为人们创造和平安宁生活的正常条件。爱好和平的比利时人民也愈来愈坚决地提出类似的要求，这从比利时社会人士和政界人物的许多谈话中可以看出来。
    信中指出，比利时最大的工会组织比利时总工会主张禁止原子武器和氢武器，比利时社会党代表大会通过决议，主张巩固和平和各国人民之间的合作，比利时自由党议会党团领袖、参议员穆罗代表自由党发表反对在比利时领土上配置核武器和反对美英的“相互依赖主义”的声明，这些事实都是令人满意的。
    布尔加宁在提到苏联政府关于举行各国领导人最高级会议的建议的时候说，希望这些建议将得到比利时首相和政府的谅解和支持。
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社喀布尔讯：阿富汗首相达乌德11日在记者招待会上发表声明，阿富汗政府完全支持苏联政府关于举行最高级会议的建议，它认为这是一个旨在消除国际紧张局势和解决大多数问题的及时而英明的步骤。
    他在谈到阿富汗参加苏联所建议的高级会议的可能性时说，如果一切有关国家同意阿富汗参加这个会议，那么它将极其负责地完成自己的使命。
    苏联建议中指出，像阿富汗这样的国家参加会议是适宜的。
    达乌德首相在阐述阿富汗政府对国际问题的立场时着重指出，忠实于联合国原则的阿富汗始终支持和平共处的政策，支持为普遍裁军创造前提的政策；始终拥护停止军备竞赛、禁止核武器生产和试验，以及销毁现存的这种武器，争取把新型的动力完全用于和平目的。阿富汗一贯主张缔结互不侵犯条约和禁止战争；主张扩大国际合作，主张各国政府承担通过和平途径并且在联合国范围内解决一切争端的义务。达乌德首相着重指出，目前，阿富汗的外交政策仍然是以这些原则为基础的。
