　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Soviet government's proposal has generated considerable interest in international public opinion. Prominent figures and the press in Britain and France have expressed support for holding a high-level East-West conference, urging Western countries to seriously consider the Soviet peace proposal.

　　British Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell stated in an interview with a "Reynold News" reporter on January 12th that Britain should accept Bulganin's proposal for a summit aimed at easing international tensions.

　　In this newspaper interview, Gaitskell said that the Soviet proposal "has at least three points that are welcome in their current situation," and Britain "should express its agreement," namely: a period of cessation of nuclear weapons testing; the creation of a nuclear-free zone in Europe; and discussion of a plan to end the tense situation in the Middle East. At the same time, Gaitskell believed that this alone was not enough, and he also called on Britain to "put forward its own peace proposals." In this regard, he suggested discussing "the cessation of all nuclear weapons production under international supervision" and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Central Europe.

　　Gaitskell believed that if the West rejected the Soviet proposal in the old way by calling it "propaganda," the "impact on the people of non-aligned countries in Asia or on many people in Western Europe would be terrible."

　　British Communist Party General Secretary John Gollan called on the workers' movement to launch a nationwide movement to force the British government to agree to immediate negotiations.

　　Many prominent figures in Britain also expressed satisfaction with Bulganin's proposal in talks with the "Daily Worker" reporter on January 11, and hoped that Western countries would give a positive response to this proposal.

　　The famous philosopher Bertrand Russell said that he fully agreed with holding a high-level meeting, "especially if this meeting can promote some kind of agreement to ban thermonuclear weapons." He believed that establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe "would bring many benefits," and he also believed that a region where no foreign troops are stationed must be established. He also pointed out the importance of signing a non-aggression treaty.

　　Conservative MP Busby also said: "We should take the Russians' proposal to establish a neutral zone in Europe seriously."

　　In the British press, the "News Chronicle" published an article by John Dickie on January 11, pointing out that the Soviet Union sincerely hopes to negotiate with the United States. Dickie believes that "an agreement between these two great powers would be a model prelude to an agreement between the Warsaw Pact and NATO members." The author also said that the West certainly cannot ignore the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. "The Manchester Guardian" diplomatic commentator Scott said on January 10 that the heads of Western countries, regardless of the demands of the general public, are trying their best to step up preparations for war and obstruct negotiations with the Soviet Union. If the British and American governments agree to negotiate with the Soviet Union "only under pressure from public opinion," then "rather than wanting to use the meeting to seriously discuss specific issues, they want to use the meeting to show their own people that negotiations with the Russians are hopeless." Scott said: "Therefore, those who now believe that it is necessary to negotiate with Moscow should clearly state what issues they want to discuss and what methods they think these issues should be resolved by." Scott believes that the most pressing issues are the withdrawal of foreign troops from Central Europe and the non-deployment of nuclear weapons in this region.

　　According to a dispatch from Paris: Jean Faucheron pointed out in an article in "Paris Radical News" that the Soviet government's proposal has received a huge response among the entire French people, because they are eager to achieve common peace. "Le Figaro" wrote, "Holding a high-level meeting is possible." It pointed out that there is "disagreement on the attitude towards the Soviet proposal" among the governments of the North Atlantic Alliance member states. "Les Echos" said when talking about the Soviet proposal to hold a meeting of leaders of East and West countries that this proposal put the "Western countries in a difficult situation. These countries are afraid of holding such a meeting, but they understand that sooner or later they will have to agree to hold such a meeting." "Paris Journal" published an article by its commentator pointing out that Eisenhower's State of the Union address to Congress "not only did not put forward any new propositions sufficient to lead to East-West talks under the current conditions, but not even a hint." The commentator believes that East and West countries must hold talks immediately.

　　Paris's democratic newspapers unanimously welcome the Soviet Union's efforts to end the "Cold War."

### 苏联建议发生巨大吸引力  英法舆论纷纷支持举行谈判

    苏联建议发生巨大吸引力
    英法舆论纷纷支持举行谈判
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联政府的建议在国际舆论界中发生了巨大的吸引力。英法两国的著名人士和报界纷纷表示支持召开东西方高级会议，要求西方国家认真看待苏联的和平建议。
    英国工党领袖盖次克尔12日在对“雷诺新闻”的记者发表的谈话中表示，英国应该接受布尔加宁提出的举行旨在缓和国际紧张局势的最高级会议的建议。
    盖次克尔在这家报纸的访问记中说，苏联的建议“至少有三点就其目前情况看来是受人欢迎的”，英国“应当表示同意”，即：停止核武器试验一段时期；在欧洲划出一个无原子区；讨论结束中东紧张局势的计划。同时，盖次克尔认为，单是这样还是不够的，他还要求英国“提出自己的和平建议”。在这方面，他建议讨论“在国际监督下停止一切核武器生产”以及从中欧地区撤退一切外国军队等问题。
    盖次克尔认为，如果西方按照老办法把苏联的建议说成是“宣传”而迅速加以拒绝，那“对亚洲不参加集团国家的人民或者是对于西欧的很多人民所产生的影响是再坏不过的了”。
    英国共产党总书记高兰向工人运动呼吁，要求展开全民运动来迫使英国政府同意立刻举行谈判。
    英国许多著名人士11日在同“工人日报”记者谈话时也都对布尔加宁的建议表示满意，并且希望西方国家能够对这个建议作肯定的答复。
    著名的哲学家罗素说，他完全赞同举行高级会议，“特别是这次会议如果能促进达成某种禁止热核武器的协议的话”。他认为，在欧洲建立无原子武器区“会带来很多好处”，他并且认为，必须建立一个不驻扎任何外国军队的地区。他还指出了签订互不侵犯条约的重要意义。
    保守党议员布斯比也说：“我们应当认真对待俄国人关于在欧洲建立中立区的建议”。
    在英国报界，“新闻纪事报”11日刊登了约翰·迪基的文章，指出苏联真诚地希望同美国进行谈判。迪基认为，“这两个大国达成协议将是华沙条约缔约国同北大西洋公约组织成员国缔结协定的模范的前奏。”作者还说，西方当然不能忽视在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议。“曼彻斯特卫报”外交评论员斯科特10日说，西方国家的首脑不顾广大公众的要求，千方百计地企图加紧备战和阻挠同苏联谈判。英美政府如果“只是迫于舆论压力”而同意同苏联谈判，那“与其说它们想利用会议来认真地讨论具体问题，倒不如说它们想利用会议来向本国人民表明同俄国人谈判是没有希望的”。斯科特说：“因此，那些现在认为必须同莫斯科进行谈判的人应当清楚地表明，他们希望讨论哪些问题和他们认为这些问题应当用什么方式解决”。斯科特认为最迫切的问题是外国军队撤出中欧和不在这个地区配置核武器。
    另据巴黎消息：让·法戎在“巴黎激进新闻”上发表文章指出，苏联政府的建议在法国全体人民中间得到巨大的反响，因为他们殷切希望实现共同的和平。“费加罗报”写道，“召开高级会议是可能的”。它指出，北大西洋联盟成员国政府之间“对苏联建议的态度是不一致的”。“回声报”在谈到苏联关于召开东西方国家领导人会议的建议时说，这项建议使“西方国家处境狼狈。这些国家害怕召开这种会议，但是他们明白，迟早是要同意召开这种会议的。”“巴黎日报”登载了该报评论员的一篇文章指出，艾森豪威尔给国会的国情咨文“不仅没有提出任何新的主张，足以在目前的条件下导致东西方的会谈，甚至连一点点暗示都没有”。这位评论员认为东西方国家必须立即举行会谈。
    巴黎的民主报刊一致欢迎苏联结束“冷战”的努力。
