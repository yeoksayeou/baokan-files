    Some amusing things happened during the NATO summit:
    The Paris post office received a letter addressed to "Premier Bulganin, Palais de Chaillot, Paris." The post office wrote on the envelope: "No such person, forward to Moscow."
    In London, a BBC reporter, testing listeners' knowledge of current affairs, asked an old lady, "Who represents Britain at the Paris conference?" The old lady replied without hesitation: "Eisenhower."
    We shouldn't laugh at this French citizen and British old lady or blame them for lacking common sense. Rather, these two small incidents reflect the thinking of the British and French people. They believe that the Soviet Premier should participate in international conferences held in Paris; they also see that in the current international political situation, it is not Prime Minister Macmillan who represents Britain, but Eisenhower.

    错得有理
    北大西洋公约首脑会议期间有这么两件趣事：
    巴黎邮局收到一封信，寄给“巴黎夏乐宫布尔加宁总理”。邮局在信封上批上：“无此人，改投莫斯科”。
    在伦敦，英国广播公司记者为了测验听众时事知识，问一位老太太“谁代表英国出席巴黎会议？”老太太毫不迟疑地说：“艾森豪威尔”。
    我们不该嘲笑这位法国公民和英国老太太，怪他们缺乏常识。应该说这两件小事反映了英法人民的想法。他们认为在巴黎举行的国际会议应当有苏联总理参加；他们也看出了在目前国际政局中，代表英国的早已不是麦克米伦首相，而是艾森豪威尔。
