Introducing Simple Therapies to Downward-Sent Comrades
　　Wang Min
　　I am a doctor at the Acupuncture Research Institute. I have been to the countryside several times for mobile medical services and research work, so I am relatively familiar with the rural situation. As a doctor, I am particularly concerned about the health of downward-sent cadres. Now I would like to introduce several methods for treating common illnesses and injuries that are likely to occur when starting labor, as a way to help my downward-sent comrades.

　　People who have lived in the city for a long time may experience symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, and stomach discomfort when they first arrive in the countryside and are not used to the diet. At this time, moxa sticks are needed. Moxa sticks are easy to make. First, buy some moxa wool from a traditional Chinese medicine store, then buy some hemp paper. Cut the hemp paper into strips 1.5 inches wide and 5 inches long. Roll the moxa wool inside the hemp paper to make it look like a cigarette, ready for temporary use. If diarrhea occurs, the moxa stick can be lit and used to smoke and roast the navel, feeling warm and comfortable, for about 15-20 minutes each time. If constipation occurs, first eat more vegetables. If eating more vegetables still does not solve the problem, you can buy a dose of Six-Ingredient Digestive Drink (3 qian of hawthorn, 3 qian of betel nut, 3 qian of medicated leaven, 3 qian of malt), plus about 2 qian of scorched rhubarb, which can have a laxative effect. If stomach discomfort occurs, you can also use the aforementioned moxa stick to moxibustrate about 5 finger-widths above the navel for about 10 minutes, or you can take Six-Ingredient Digestive Drink (dosage as mentioned above) or Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San, 5 qian each time, which will help regulate digestive function. There are traditional Chinese medicine stores in every township, so buying medicine is very convenient.

　　When downward-sent cadres first participate in physical labor, the amount of labor should not be too great. It is more appropriate to gradually increase the amount of labor from small to large, from less to more. In the early stages of labor, symptoms of blisters on the hands and feet, and back pain are likely to occur. If blisters appear on the hands and feet, first wash them with hot water, or use a sterilized needle (the needle can be burned on a fire for a while) to pierce the blister, so that the water flows out, then apply some Vaseline, cover with clean gauze, and bandage it with a bandage. You can continue to work until calluses grow on your hands, then there will be no problem. After doing heavy labor, do not go to bed immediately to rest. Take a walk in the yard and do some calisthenics to allow the joints to move in a relaxed state, and then go to bed and sleep peacefully. If the pain in the limbs is more severe, you can ask the local doctor to treat it with acupuncture or take a short rest.

　　When learning agricultural production, it is very likely that injuries will occur due to unfamiliarity with the tools. If a sprain occurs, you can ask the local doctor to treat it with surgical methods or acupuncture. If a small wound occurs, apply some red mercury or iodine, cover with sterile gauze, and bandage it with a bandage, or stick it with adhesive tape to avoid infection. If the injured area is large, or if the area is not large but there is an increase in fever symptoms, you must quickly send to the hospital for treatment. Do not delay, so as not to miss the opportunity for treatment.

　　Mountain areas mostly have a continental climate. The temperature changes greatly in one day, so special attention should be paid to keeping the body warm. In rural areas, people often get up and start working when the sky is about to dawn, and it is very cold at this time, so it is easy to catch a cold. Each time before labor, you can take off excess clothes, and immediately put them on after finishing labor. Do not take off clothes when you are covered in sweat during labor, because doing so will make you more likely to catch a cold. If you find symptoms such as headache, nasal congestion, body aches, and fatigue in the limbs, it is best to take one Ling Qiao Jie Du Wan pill or 6 qian of Yin Qiao San before going to bed, using fresh reed root as a guide to decoct the soup and take it. Or take 0.25 grams of aspirin, cover yourself with more quilts, drink some boiled water, and sweating will make you feel better.

### 给下放同志介绍几种简易疗法

    给下放同志介绍几种简易疗法
    王敏
    我是针灸研究所的医生，过去曾数次去农村作巡回医疗和研究工作，对农村情况较熟悉。作为医生，我对下放干部的身体健康特别关心，现在介绍几种初参加劳动容易发生的疾病和外伤的治理方法，作为我对下放同志的帮助。
    久住城市初到农村的人，饮食开始不习惯，可能发生腹泻、便秘、胃部不适等症状。此时便需要艾卷了。艾卷很容易做，首先到中药铺买些艾绒，再买些麻纸，将麻纸裁成一点五市寸宽，五市寸长的纸条，将艾绒卷在麻纸内，做成好像烟卷的形状，以备临时取用。如果发生了腹泻，可以将艾卷燃着，对准脐孔熏烤，感到温热舒适为宜，每次可持续十五——二十分钟。如果发生了便秘，首先多吃蔬菜，如果多吃蔬菜仍不能解决，可买四消饮（山楂三钱，槟榔三钱，神曲三钱，麦芽三钱）一服，再加焦军二钱左右，可以收到通便的功效。如果发生了胃部不适，亦可用前述艾卷灸脐孔上五横指处约十分钟左右的时间，也可以服四消饮（量如前述）或藿香正气散，每次五钱，对调理消化机能都有帮助。中药铺乡乡有，买药很方便。
    下放干部刚刚参加体力劳动时，劳动量不能太大，采取由小到大、由少到多逐渐增加的方式比较稳妥。在劳动的初期很可能发生手脚打泡，腰酸背痛的症候。如果手脚打泡，第一步用热水洗一洗，或用消毒过（可将针放在火上烧一会）的针将泡刺破，水即流出，再涂些凡士林，用清洁纱布盖上，用绷带包扎好，仍可继续劳动，等到手上生了茧，就没有问题了。做过重劳动后，不要马上卧床休息，在院内散散步，做做广播操，使各个关节在松弛状态下活动活动，然后再上床安眠。如果肢体疼痛较为严重，可请当地医生用针灸治疗或稍事休息。
    刚刚学习农业生产，工具用的不熟练，很可能发生外伤。如果发生了扭伤，可以找当地医生用外科方法或用针灸疗法处理。如果发生了小的破伤，可涂些红汞水或碘酒，上面盖以消毒纱布，用绷带包扎，或用胶布贴好，以免感染。如果受伤面积较大，或面积不大却增加了发烧症状，需赶快送医院治疗，不要拖延，以免失掉治疗的时机。
    山区多为大陆性气候，一日之中，温度变动较大，身体的保温应当特别注意，农村中多在天色将明未明时起身开始劳动，这时天很冷，很易受凉感冒。每次在劳动前，可将过多的衣服脱掉，劳动完毕后马上穿好，不要在劳动过程中满身大汗时再减衣服，因为那样做更易感冒。如果发现有头痛、鼻塞、全身酸痛、四肢倦怠等症状，最好在睡前服羚翘解毒丸一丸或银翘散六钱，用鲜芦根为引子，煎汤送下。或服阿斯匹灵零点二五克，多盖被子，喝些开水，出点汗就好了。
