Rushing Towards a New Climax
    ——A Record of the Representative Meeting of Active Elements in Socialist Agricultural Construction in Hebei Province
    By our reporter Tian Liu

    The train speeds across the Hebei Province countryside…

    The snow in the fields is melting. Here and there, patches of newly exposed land glisten with a moist, brown radiance under the sun, giving a warm, fresh feeling. I want to look at the scenery outside the window—the train is running too fast, I can't see it clearly; before you can get a good look, the scenery is left far behind the train. It probably comes from “fast,” I thought again of that poem:

    Yesterday evening at sunset, the river was west of the depression;
    Today the sun rises, the canal water reaches the east of the village;
    At noon the sun is high, the canal water circles the village.

    This poem was said by Wang Luming, Secretary of the Cangxian County Party Committee, at the provincial representative meeting of active elements in socialist agricultural construction a few days ago. The author of the poem is a member of the Dongcheng Township Agricultural Cooperative in Hejian County. Their township is responding to the Party's call and carrying out a winter water conservancy construction movement. People decided to build two canals totaling twenty-five li. The earthwork alone requires more than one million cubic meters. At that time, the cadres estimated that it would take at least ten days to complete. As a result, it was completed in half a day and one night. Originally, the river was west of the village, and in the morning, it was already diverted into the canal east of the village, and at noon, it had begun to irrigate the wheat fields. Like Hejian, other places are the same. The people of the whole province are taking heroic steps to march toward nature, determined to achieve a new leap forward in production in this new year. Originally, the province planned to transform eight million to ten million mu of dry land into irrigated land in 1958. Since mid-October last year, in just over two months, the irrigated area has been expanded by seventeen million mu. The annual task was completed more than doubled in two months. This speed is fast enough!

    "This was the speed before the meeting," Chen Zhe, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture, told me when introducing the situation. "After this meeting of active elements, the speed will be even faster."

    I fully believe this conclusion—how can I not believe it? Just from some of the things I have seen and heard in the past few days, everything has been powerfully illustrated. As soon as the meeting ended, the Secretary of the Zhangjiakou Prefectural Party Committee said to Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee: "Lao Lin, say nothing more, let's do it!" The Baoding Prefectural Party Committee could not wait for the closing of the conference and convened a meeting of the Party Committees of the counties to arrange for the Great Leap Forward. The meeting of active elements ended on January 15. On the 18th—just two days later, a provincial four-level cadre meeting will be held. But as soon as the meeting was announced to be adjourned, Wang Luming, Secretary of the Cangxian County Party Committee, said to the County Party Secretaries in his region: "Let's go, let's go back to the Prefectural Committee to hold a meeting first." Handan Prefecture, Xingtai Prefecture… how can I finish saying it all! No matter which cadre attending the meeting you contact, no matter which activist you meet, you always see indomitable perseverance, invincible confidence, unwavering will, and surging revolutionary enthusiasm. What you always hear is: "Leap Forward," "Cross the Yellow River," "Cross the Yangtze River," "Realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule"... More than sixty counties in the province want to reach the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program, and Tangshan Prefecture—a whole prefecture, wants to become a "400-jin prefecture" this year.

    People's thinking often lags behind reality. Some people, seeing this overwhelming momentum, are a little frightened, and even ask the cadres and activists attending the meeting: "Is it possible?"

    "Why not?" The representatives attending the meeting answered him like this—how well they answered, "Go to the agricultural exhibition and take a look. They are people, and we are also people. What they could do last year, why can't we do it this year?"

    The exhibition is specially organized to cooperate with the provincial socialist agricultural activist meeting. It not only contains typical examples, but also comprehensive situations; not only exhibits physical objects from high-yield units, but also specific experience introductions; not only reviews past achievements, but also future struggle goals; not only praises the advanced, but also criticizes the backward—especially this point, which makes the advanced even more advanced, and the backward strive to catch up. This method of combining praise and criticism, this method of grasping the two ends for sharp comparison, is concentratedly expressed on the "Production List" in each exhibition hall.

    Whether you walk into the provincial comprehensive hall or into the branch halls of each prefecture, the first thing that catches your attention is the tall and bright production list. It first tells you: During the First Five-Year Plan, especially in 1957, Hebei Province achieved great achievements in agricultural production. The total output value of agriculture and sideline industries in the province increased by 28% compared with 1952—the year before the start of the Five-Year Plan. Secondly, the production list will tell you: The area of high-yield areas is getting larger and larger, and the number of high-yield units is increasing. Eleven counties (cities) in the province have reached or exceeded the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program in terms of grain output, and nine counties (cities) have reached or exceeded the targets in terms of cotton output; 2,849 agricultural cooperatives have achieved a yield per unit area of ​​400 jin or more. Third, after reading the production list, you will believe that the potential of the land is infinite, and the yield is endless. In Hebei Province, whether it is sorghum, millet, corn, wheat, or rice, there are records of yields exceeding 1,000 jin per mu; cotton has a record of 387.2 jin of ginned cotton per mu; and in more than 28 mu of land in ten agricultural cooperatives in seven counties, there have also appeared typical examples of 2,000 jin of grain per mu. Finally, the production list will make you think deeply. Which of the cadres and more than 1,000 activists attending the meeting has not stood in front of the production list for a long time, thinking intently and feeling agitated?

    "The whole province is making a great leap forward in production, but our county is still stuck five years ago."

    "Some people have crossed the Yellow River, some have crossed the Yangtze River, but we are still north of the Great Wall."

    "Eleven counties have reached the targets of the Program, but our output is not as high as in 1952!"

    "Zunhua, Funing, and Lulong are at the foot of the Great Wall. The mountainous areas, the climate is cold, and the conditions are much worse than our plains. But they reached the target of 400 jin per mu last year!"

    "What's the use of sighing! See you at the autumn harvest."

    —The representatives attending the meeting were discussing agitatedly in front of the production list for a long time. Many people couldn't eat or sleep after reading the production list, held symposiums overnight, looked for ways to increase production, and revised production plans; then, they wrote letters to the counties and cooperatives, made phone calls to the counties and cooperatives, reported the high-yield experience of various places, and asked them to "abandon conservative ideas, revise the production increase plan, take out revolutionary enthusiasm, and realize the Great Leap Forward in production." Strive to catch up with advanced areas as soon as possible. After the representatives of the advanced areas saw the production list, they not only did not relax, but became more humble and cautious, and their enthusiasm doubled. Zunhua County, which had already exceeded the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program in 1957, originally planned to reach a yield of 500 jin per mu this year. After visiting the exhibition, all the representatives immediately held a meeting and revised the plan. Guarantee to reach 600 jin per mu, and strive for 700 jin.

    The content of the exhibition is rich and colorful. Walking from the production list to the hall, everyone will get everything they need. Cadres and county party secretaries want to know how the Funing County Party Committee turned a poor mountainous county into a 400-jin county? Well, the five large hoes on display in the exhibition hall are an important explanation. Those are the large hoes of the five people: the secretary of the Funing County Party Committee, the Minister of Organization, the Minister of Rural Work, the Director of the Office, and the Deputy County Governor. They personally carried the large hoes and led the masses to manage the mountains and repair the trenches, thereby boosting the enthusiasm of the masses and launching a vigorous mass production movement, and finally achieved the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program in 1957.

    Can low-lying areas and saline-alkali areas achieve a great leap forward in production? Why not! Tianjin Prefecture and Cangxian Prefecture have already set vivid examples. Look, here is Tuanbo Depression in Jinghai County, Tianjin Prefecture. Three years ago, out of the 470,000 mu of land here, 290,000 mu were still barren. Even the 180,000 mu of cultivated land could only harvest about 30 jin of grain per mu in good years. Under the leadership of the local Party Committee, the people of the entire Depression, after three years of hard struggle and heroic labor, finally achieved great achievements. Before the transformation of the Depression in 1954, the people here only had an average annual income of 100 jin of grain per person. In 1957, it reached 1,198 jin, an increase of nearly eleven times. Last year's yield per mu has increased from about 30 jin before the transformation of the Depression to 500 jin, and more than 4,000 mu of rice has exceeded 1,000 jin.

    "Raising pigs is a good thing, but because of the lack of concentrated feed, so..."—this used to be the argument of many people. Look, here is Zunhua County, where there is one pig per person and 400,000 pigs are raised in the whole county; here is Anxiang Township in Xingtang County, where 10,000 pigs are raised in one township; here is... No matter which hall you enter, you will see vivid stories of the rapid development of the pig industry. How did they do it? The folks in Xingtang County said it well: "Pigs eat all kinds of grass, it depends on whether you can find it." These counties, townships, and cooperatives used wild vegetables and grasses as roughage to develop the pig-raising business. Zunhua County has found more than 80 kinds of wild vegetables, grasses, and wild fruits to feed pigs. The baskets of wild grass and vegetables in the exhibition hall are all food that pigs love to eat; the square items like tea bricks are feed bricks made from wild grass and vegetables; this is a good feed for pigs in autumn and winter when there is no fresh grass in the wild. These bags of fine flour are made from wild fruits, corn cobs, peanut skins, etc., and are nutritious products for pigs to gain weight. If you still don't believe it, then go to the pigsty outside the exhibition hall to take a look. There are several large fat pigs there, the small ones weighing more than 100 jin and the large ones weighing more than 200 jin. Isn't the breeder feeding them? Do you see clearly what it is feeding them? Isn't it the feed brick displayed in the exhibition hall?

    The conditions in mountainous areas are poor and the production channels are narrow—wrong. Chengde Prefecture is a mountainous area, but it has become a region where "there is autumn in every festival of the year." Here is Zhangjiayingzi Township in Pingquan. Because they have developed a variety of businesses and carried out a variety of productions, there is now autumn every month and every festival. When describing their current production, the people in the village happily said: "In spring, when the flowers bloom, there is an autumn harvest of medicinal materials; when the leaves close, there is an autumn harvest of bracken; after the dog days, there is an autumn harvest of apricot kernels; after the beginning of autumn, there is an autumn harvest of mushrooms; when it comes to White Dew, there is an autumn harvest of walnuts, hazelnuts, cashmere and wool, followed by the autumn harvest of the three major fields; in the middle, there is also an autumn harvest of pine nuts; harvesting and weaving in autumn; at the beginning of winter, there is an autumn harvest of cutting firewood; in the cold winter, there is an autumn harvest of hunting; with the great leap forward in production, a new autumn harvest of silkworm raising has been added this year."

    It is impossible to introduce all the content of the exhibition hall—even the most important content. It is also impossible to write about the achievements of this meeting—even the most basic education, inspiration, and encouragement. Let's use the words of the representatives attending the meeting to draw a conclusion:

    "There are only two days to visit the exhibition hall, which is too little. I hope to have more time to take a closer look."

    "After visiting the exhibition and listening to the provincial Party Committee's report, I have a better understanding of the correctness of the Party's leadership, the superiority of cooperativization, the boundless wisdom of the masses, the infinite potential of the land, and the endless production."

    "After learning from experience, we have gained ambition and boosted revolutionary enthusiasm. We must realize the great leap forward in production."

    Throughout the entire meeting process, whether in the meeting place or during breaks; whether it was a general meeting speech or a group discussion; whether it was visiting the exhibition or exchanging experiences in various regions, it was always "Leap Forward, Leap Forward," "Cross the Yellow River," "Cross the Yangtze River"...

    Two days have passed, and the vivid and enthusiastic scene is still vivid in my mind. Now, I am sitting on a fast-moving train speeding forward. Looking out the window into the distance, the manure piles in the fields are densely packed, looking like a sea of ​​turbulent waves from afar. The large carts transporting manure are still transporting it to the fields in groups. One well-digging rig after another stands tall in the fields; teams of people opening canals and repairing rivers are fighting on both sides of the embankment. These moving scenes flashed past. But looking forward, there are more carts delivering manure, groups of people digging wells, and rows of people opening canals. The train runs very fast, but they are always in front of the train.

    奔向新高潮
    ——记河北省社会主义农业建设积极分子代表会议
    本报记者　田流
    火车在河北省的原野上飞驰……
    田野上的积雪正在融化，这里那里，一片片刚刚露出来的土地，在阳光下闪烁着的湿润的褐色的光辉，给人一种温暖、清新的感觉。我想看看窗外的景色——火车跑得太快了，老是看不清楚；还没等你看准，那景色早被丢到火车后面去了。大概就是从“快”上来的吧，我又想起了那首诗：
    昨日夕阳下，河水在西洼；
    今日旭日升，渠水到村东；
    中午日正南，渠水围村转。
    这首诗是前几天沧县地委书记王路明在省的社会主义农业建设积极分子代表会上说的。作诗的人是河间县东城乡农业社的一位社员。他们乡正在响应党的号召，开展冬季兴修水利运动，人们决定修两条共二十五里的水渠。这水渠光是挖土工程，就得作一百多万公方。当时，干部们估计，至少得十天才能完成。结果，一个半天加上一个夜晚就完成了。原来，河在村西，早晨起来，已经把它引到村东的渠道里，中午，已经开始浇麦地了。河间这样，别的地方也是这样，全省人民，正在迈开英雄的步伐，向大自然进军，决心在这新的年份，实现一个新的生产大跃进。本来省里计划1958年把八百万亩到一千万亩旱地改变为水浇地。从去年10月中旬起，只两个多月的时间，就已经扩大浇地面积一千七百万亩。两个月超过一倍完成了全年任务。这速度够多快！
    “这是会议以前的速度”，农业厅陈哲副厅长介绍情况时，这样告诉我，“这次积极分子会开过以后，速度还会更快起来。”
    我完全相信这个论断——哪能不相信呢？仅从几天来个人看到和听到的一些事情，已经十分有力地说明一切了。会议刚结束，张家口地委书记对省委第一书记林铁同志说：“老林，什么也别说啦，干吧！”保定地委等不及大会闭幕，就召开了各县党委会议，布置大跃进；积极分子会议是1月15日结束的。18日——就是两天后，又要举行全省四级干部会。但是会刚一宣布散会，沧县地委书记王路明同志就对本地区的县委书记们说：“走，先回地委开个会。”邯郸专区、邢台专区……怎么能说完呢！无论跟哪一个出席会议的干部接触，无论是跟哪一位积极分子见面，见到的总是无坚不摧的毅力，无往不胜的信心，坚定不移的意志和澎湃的革命干劲。听到的总是：“跃进”，“越过黄河”，“跨过长江”，“提前实现全国农业发展纲要”……。全省有六十多个县，要达到全国农业发展纲要规定的指标，而唐山专区——整整一个专区啊，要在今年成为“四百斤专区”。
    人的思想常常落在实际的后面。有的人见了这种排山倒海的气魄，竟有点胆战心惊，甚至还问出席会议的干部和积极分子们：“能行吗？”
    “为什么不行呢？”出席会议的代表们这样回答他——回答得多好啊，“你到农业展览会看看去吧，人家是人，我们也是人，人家去年能做到的事情，我们为什么今年还不能做到呢？”
    展览会是专门配合全省社会主义农业积极分子会议举办的。里面不仅有典型事例，也有全面情况；不仅有丰产单位的实物展出，还有具体的经验介绍；不仅有过去成绩的检阅，也有今后的奋斗目标；不仅有对先进的表扬，也有对落后的批评——特别是这一点，它使先进的更加先进，落后的急起直追。这种表扬和批评相结合的方法，这种抓两头尖锐对比的方法，集中地表现在各个展览馆里的“生产榜”上。
    无论你走进全省的综合馆，还是走进各个专区的分馆，首先引起你注意的，是那张高大鲜明的生产榜。它首先告诉你：第一个五年计划，特别是1957年，河北省的农业生产获得了巨大的成就，全省农业和副业的总产值，比1952年——五年计划开始前一年增长了28％。其次，生产榜会告诉你：丰产的地区越来越大，丰产单位是越来越多了。全省已经有十一个县
  （市）的粮食产量、九个县（市）的棉花产量，达到和超过了全国农业发展纲要的指标；有二千八百四十九个农业社的单位面积产量达到或超过了四百斤。第三，看了生产榜，你会相信土地潜力无穷，产量永无止境。在河北省，无论高粱、谷子、玉米、麦子、稻子，都有亩产千斤以上的纪录；棉花有亩产三百八十七点二斤皮棉的纪录；在七个县的十个农业社的二十八亩多土地上，还出现了亩产粮食二千斤的典型。最后，生产榜会使你沉思起来。出席会议的全体干部和一千多名积极分子，谁不曾长久地站在生产榜前凝神细想、激动不安呢？
    “全省生产大跃进，我们县还停在五年前。”
    “人家有的过黄河、有的过长江，我们还在长城北面。”
    “十一个县达到纲要了，我们产量还不如1952年高！”
    “遵化、抚宁、卢龙在长城脚下，山区、气候冷，条件跟咱平原比，差多了，可人家去年就达到了亩产四百斤的指标！”
    “叹气有什么用呢！秋收见吧。”
    ——出席会议的代表们，就是这样长久地站在生产榜前激动不安的议论着。很多人看了生产榜吃不下饭、睡不着觉，连夜开座谈会、找增产门路、修改生产计划；而后，给县里社里写信，给县里社里打电话，报告各地的丰产经验，要他们“丢掉保守思想，修改增产计划，拿出革命干劲，实现生产大跃进。”力争最快地赶上先进地区。先进地区的代表看过生产榜以后，不仅没有松劲，反而更加谦虚谨慎，干劲倍增。1957年已经超过全国农业发展纲要指标的遵化县，原计划今年亩产量达到五百斤，参观展览会以后，全体代表立即开会，修改了计划。保证达到亩产六百斤，争取七百斤。
    展览会内容是丰富多彩的。从生产榜前向馆里走去，人人都会得到自己需要的一切。干部们、县委书记们想知道抚宁县委怎样把个穷苦的山区县变成四百斤县吗？好吧，展览馆里摆着的五把大镐就是个重要说明。那是抚宁县委书记、组织部长、农村工作部长和办公室主任、副县长五个人的大镐。他们亲自背着大镐，到山上领导着群众治山修壕，从而鼓起了群众的干劲，开展起了轰轰烈烈的大生产运动，终于在1957年达到了全国农业发展纲要的指标。
    低洼地区、盐碱地区能够实现生产大跃进吗？怎么不能呢！天津专区、沧县专区不是已经作出了生动的榜样吗？看吧，这里是天津专区静海县的团泊洼。三年前这里的四十七万亩土地，还有二十九万亩荒芜着，就是耕种着的十八万亩土地，好年景时一亩地也不过只能收三十斤上下粮食。在当地党委领导下，全洼人民经过三年苦斗，英勇劳动，终于获得了巨大成就。洼地改造以前的1954年，这里的人民，每个人平均一年只有一百斤粮食收入，1957年竟达到了一千一百九十八斤，增长了近十一倍。去年的亩产量已经由洼地改造以前的三十斤左右提高到五百斤，有四千多亩的水稻已经超过了一千斤。
    “养猪是好事情，就是因为缺少精饲料，所以……”——这曾经是不少人的论调。你看，这里是一人一猪，全县养猪四十万口的遵化县，这里是一个乡就养万口猪的行唐县安香乡，这里是……不论走进哪个馆都会看到养猪业飞跃发展的生动事迹。他们是怎么搞的呢？行唐县的老乡说得好：“猪吃百样草，看你找不找”。这些县、乡、社就是采用野菜、野草等粗饲料来开展起养猪事业的。遵化县找到了八十多种野菜、野草、野果来喂猪。展览馆里那一筐筐的野草野菜，都是猪爱吃的食品；那方方正正像茶砖一样物品，就是用野草野菜加工制造的饲料砖；这是秋后和冬天野外没有鲜草时，喂猪的好饲料。这一袋袋精致面粉，是用野果、玉米芯、花生皮等等东西磨成的，是猪长膘时的营养品。如果你还不信，那么到展览馆外面猪舍里去看看吧，那里有好几口大肥猪，小的百多斤，大的二百多斤，饲养员不是正喂它们吗？看清那是用什么东西喂的吗？不正是展览馆里陈列着的这种饲料砖么？
    山区条件差，生产门路窄——不对。承德专区是山区，可是已经成了“一年二十四节，节节有秋”的地区了。这里是平泉张家营子乡，由于他们开展了多种多样的经营，进行了多种多样的生产，现在月月节节都有秋了。村里的人们在描述他们如今的生产时，欢乐地说道：“春暖花开药材秋，树叶关门蕨菜秋，入了伏是杏核秋，立了秋是蘑菇秋，到了白露是核桃秋、榛子秋、羊绒羊毛秋、接二连三大田秋，当中还夹着个松子秋，割条编织秋，立子冬是割柴伐木秋，数九隆冬打猎秋，生产大跃进，今年又新添了个养蚕秋。”
    要想把展览馆里的内容——哪怕是最主要的内容都介绍出来，是不可能的。要把这次会议的成就——哪怕是给人最起码的教育、启发和鼓舞写出来，也是办不到的。还是用出席会议的代表们自己的话，给它作个结论吧：
    “参观展览馆只有两天时间，太少了，希望再给些时间细看看。”
    “看了展览会，听了省委报告，更体会到党领导的正确，合作化的优越性，群众智慧无边，土地潜力无穷，生产无顶。”
    “学了经验，长了志气，鼓起了革命干劲，一定要实现生产大跃进。”
    整个的会议过程中，不论在会场上，还是在休息的时候；不论是大会发言，还是小组座谈；不论是参观展览会，还是各个区交流经验的时候，总是“跃进，跃进”，“跨过黄河”，“越过长江”……。
    两天过去了，那生动热烈的情景仍历历如在目前。现在，我正坐在疾驶的火车上向前飞奔。透过车窗往远处望去，田里的粪肥，一堆堆摆得密密麻麻，远远望去，像是波涛四起的海洋。运送粪土的大车，还在成群结队地往田里运送。一个个挖井的架子，高高地竖立在田野上；一队队开渠修河的人们，战斗在堤岸两旁。这些动人的景色，一闪就过去了。但是向前看去，又是送粪的大车，挖井的人群，开渠的行列。火车飞跑得很快，可是他们却永远在火车的前面。
