Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th. On the Xu (Zhou) Huai (yin) Plain in Jiangsu Province, a "Young Pioneer Reservoir" and a "Young Pioneer Sluice" are going to be built. This was initiated by 449 Young Pioneers of the First Central Primary School in Yuhuatai District, Nanjing, and received enthusiastic responses from Young Pioneers throughout the province, and was decided with the support of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education and the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League. The "Young Pioneer Reservoir" has been determined to be built in Ganyu County, and the "Young Pioneer Sluice" has been determined to be built in Lianshui County.

Recently, the Young Pioneers of the First Central Primary School in Yuhuatai District used their spare time to accumulate 130,000 catties of fertilizer for agricultural cooperatives, dug a 120-zhang-long "Young Pioneer Irrigation Canal," moved 5,000 bricks for building warm beds, eliminated 147 rats and sparrows, and participated in voluntary labor such as collecting tree seeds and eradicating illiteracy. They also proposed an initiative to the Young Pioneers of the whole province: to carry out an activity of "We will also support the Forty Articles." The initiative proposed to carry out various voluntary labor activities that can be done, such as accumulating fertilizer, repairing ditches, eliminating the four pests, eradicating illiteracy, and planting sunflowers; to concentrate a part of the collective labor income to build the "Young Pioneer Reservoir" and the "Young Pioneer Sluice" as a gift from the Young Pioneers to the Second Five-Year Plan.

This initiative has been enthusiastically responded to by Young Pioneers throughout Jiangsu Province, who have formulated plans for accumulating fertilizer, eliminating the four pests, etc., and have quickly taken action. Chengnan Primary School in Yixing County, Luhui Central Primary School and Jingyang Primary School in Shanghai County have remitted a sum of money from the past "Small Five-Year Plan" activities to the Communist Youth League Committee as the first gift for the construction of the "Young Pioneer Reservoir."

On January 3, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Provincial Department of Education, and the Provincial People's Broadcasting Station jointly held the "Jiangsu Provincial Children's 'We Will Also Support the Forty Articles' Activity Radio Conference." Chen Guang, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the radio conference: "We have five million children in the province. With five million people of one mind and ten million hands, we will definitely be able to help our hometowns realize the Forty Articles faster, and we will definitely be able to build the 'Young Pioneer Reservoir' and the 'Young Pioneer Sluice'."

    “我们也来支援四十条”
    江苏少年儿童决定兴修“红领巾水库”
    新华社南京10日电　在江苏省的徐（州）淮（阴）平原上，将要建设一个“红领巾水库”和一个“红领巾水闸”。这是南京市雨花台区第一中心小学四百四十九个少先队员向全省少先队员提出倡议，受到全省各地少先队员热烈响应，并在江苏省教育厅和共青团江苏省委的支持下决定的。“红领巾水库”已经确定修建在赣榆县，“红领巾水闸”已经确定修建在涟水县。
    雨花台区第一中心小学的少先队员们，最近利用课余时间给农业社积了十三万斤肥，挖了一条长一百二十丈的“红领巾灌溉渠”，搬了五千块砌温床用的砖头，消灭了一百四十七只老鼠和麻雀，还参加了搜集树种、扫盲等义务劳动。他们并向全省少先队员们提出了一项倡议：开展一个“我们也来支援四十条”的活动。倡议信中提出，要开展各种能够做的义务劳动，像积肥、修水沟、除四害、扫盲、种向日葵等；把集体劳动收入的一部分集中起来，用来修建“红领巾水库”和“红领巾水闸”，作为少先队员们对第二个五年计划的献礼。
    这个倡议得到了江苏省各地少先队员们的热烈响应，他们纷纷制订积肥、除四害等计划，并且很快就行动起来了。宜兴县城南小学，上海县鲁汇中心小学、景仰小学已把过去“小五年计划”活动收入的一笔钱汇给了团委，作为兴建“红领巾水库”的头一笔献礼。
    共青团江苏省委和省教育厅、省人民广播电台在
  1月3日联合举办了“江苏省少年儿童开展‘我们也来支援四十条’活动广播大会”。中共江苏省委书记陈光在广播大会上说：“我们全省有五百万少年儿童，五百万人一条心，一千万只手，一定能够帮助自己的家乡更快地实现四十条，一定能够把‘红领巾水库’和‘红领巾水闸’建设起来。”
