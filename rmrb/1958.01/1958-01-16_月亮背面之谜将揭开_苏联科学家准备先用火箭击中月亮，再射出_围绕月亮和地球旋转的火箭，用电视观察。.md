    The Mystery of the Far Side of the Moon Will Be Unveiled
    Soviet Scientists Prepare to First Strike the Moon with a Rocket, Then Launch
    a Rocket Orbiting the Moon and the Earth, Observing with Television.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th. Soviet astronomer Chebotarev said in a conversation: We will soon be able to discover the secrets of the far side of the moon, the side facing away from the Earth.
    This conversation, published in the "Soviet Russia Daily" on the 14th, also pointed out that Soviet scientists will first strike the moon with a rocket, causing it to explode on the moon, to check whether people's concepts of the lunar surface are correct. For example, whether the lunar surface is really covered by a layer of dust-like material. Then, they will launch another type of rocket. This rocket will not land on the moon, but will orbit the moon and the earth. The speed of this rocket must reach eleven kilometers per second. The distance between the moon and the earth is 384,000 kilometers. The rocket can pass around the moon at a distance of 416,000 kilometers from the earth, that is, about 30,000 kilometers from the moon. The rocket can even reach a point 3,000 kilometers from the moon.
    According to this route, a half-ton rocket will take about ten days and nights to fly. In this way, through the television installed on the rocket, people can see the other side of the moon, which no astronomer has ever been able to observe before.

    月亮背面之谜将揭开
    苏联科学家准备先用火箭击中月亮，再射出
    围绕月亮和地球旋转的火箭，用电视观察。
    新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联天文学家契波塔列夫在一篇谈话中说：我们很快就能发现月亮背地球那一面的秘密了。
    发表在14日“苏维埃俄罗斯报”上的这篇谈话还指出，苏联科学家将首先用火箭击中月亮，使它在月亮上爆炸，来检查人们对月亮表面的概念是否正确。例如月亮表面是否真的为一层灰尘状的物质所掩盖等。然后，他们将要放射另一种火箭。这种火箭不落在月亮上，而绕着月亮和地球旋转。这种火箭的速度必须达到每秒十一公里。月亮和地球之间的距离是三十八万四千公里。火箭可于离地球四十一万六千公里，即离月亮约三万公里的地方绕过月亮。火箭甚至可以达到距月亮三千公里的地方。
    按照这个路线，半吨重的火箭大约需飞行十昼夜。这样，通过装在火箭上的电视机，人们可以看到以前任何一个天文学家也没能观察过的月亮的另一面。
