    Is It Worth It, and Other Matters
    Mei Er
    Born at the Wrong Time

    In doing everything, comparisons must be made. Doing it that way is worthwhile; doing it this way is not.

    The vigorous agricultural water conservancy construction now underway is being carried out after comparisons were made. Although agricultural water conservancy construction requires a large amount of manpower and material resources, it can make agricultural production take a big leap forward, which makes it worthwhile.

    The willingness of leading cadres in various agencies and organizations to send a large number of cadres to lower levels is also the result of comparisons. Although the number of people in various agencies has decreased and the work is inevitably a bit strained, this group of cadres, after being tempered, can be used as several people, which is a worthwhile thing.

    For cadres, although the business and technical skills they have learned may not be used for a while, or even become rusty as a result, as long as they improve themselves and have the idea of serving the people, it will not only be easier to review business and technical skills in the future, but also easier to learn new technologies than in the past, which is also a worthwhile thing.

    In the report "Old Red Army Regiment Commander Takes Off His Uniform to Become a Farmer" in the People's Daily on January 5, Fang Heming said a paragraph about what is worthwhile and what is not. Although the words are few, they are well said. When someone asked him whether it was worthwhile to not be a regiment commander and instead be a farmer, Fang Heming said, "Who says it's not worthwhile? I used to be a hired laborer for others, oppressed and poor for generations. I joined the revolution and defeated the enemy. Now I return to my own land to labor and produce. That's what's worthwhile! If you say this is not worthwhile, then the comrades who sacrificed are even more not worthwhile. If everyone thought like you, where would today's revolutionary victory come from?"

    Good question! If the revolution had not been carried out, if the three major enemies of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism had not been defeated, could you have lived until now? Even if you could have lived until now, could you have labored well on your own land? Could you have worked well? Could you have studied well? If the enemy had not been defeated, could the new democratic revolution have succeeded? Could the socialist revolution have been victorious? Could communism be built?

    So, some people say it's not worthwhile, only looking at it from the perspective of personal interests. In the eyes of these people, what is beneficial to the individual, and especially greatly beneficial, is worthwhile, while what is beneficial to the people, and especially greatly beneficial, is not worthwhile. Comparing and analyzing in this way, then even these individualists, being born into this society, is not worthwhile. Because this society fundamentally opposes bourgeois individualism and promotes socialist collectivism, and these people came into the world to pursue personal eating and clothing. Born at the wrong time, it's really greatly not worthwhile!

    Difficult Like Moving Mountains and Overturning Seas

    Using the words "servants of the people" to explain the relationship between Communist Party members, revolutionary workers, and the people is already very clear, but some people are still not very clear.

    Well, the report "Old Red Army Regiment Commander Takes Off His Uniform to Become a Farmer" also has a passage that can be used as an annotation to this question. That is what Fang Heming said: "In the past, I needed to fight, so I fought; now I need to farm, so I farm." Who needs it? The people need it. The relationship between Communist Party members, revolutionary workers, and the people is like this: whatever the people need to do, they do, and do well; whatever the people don't need to do, they don't do, and advise others not to do! Being able to do this is being a good servant.

    Now, many Communist Party members and revolutionary workers, although claiming to be servants of the people, cannot act according to the above principles. This time, going up to the mountains and down to the countryside is an example. Clearly, going up to the mountains and down to the countryside is something that the people need to do. This thing not only benefits the people, cultivating a group of outstanding revolutionary workers who can withstand risks for the people; it is also endlessly beneficial to oneself. Originally a semi-intellectual, after labor training, one can become a complete intellectual; originally an intellectual who "cannot distinguish the five grains" and is "unaccustomed to physical labor," after labor training, one can become an intellectual who has both cultural and scientific knowledge and labor and production experience. But some people are unwilling to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside to train, and raise many questions to the people.

    Being a servant of the people is easy for some people, but difficult for others, so difficult that it is like moving mountains and overturning seas.

    划不划得来及其他
    梅耳
    生不逢时
    做一切事情，都要作比较，那样做，划得来；那样做，就划不来。
    现在正在大力进行农业水利建设，就是作了比较后进行的。进行农业水利建设，虽然要付出大量的人力和物力，但可以使农业生产大大跃进一步，这就划得来。
    现在各机关、团体的领导干部愿意把大批干部下放，也是作过了比较的。把大批干部下放到农村，各个机关虽然人少了，工作难免有点紧张。但是这批干部锻炼好后，就可以一人当几人使用，这是划得来的事情。
    对于干部来说，现在下去锻炼，虽然所学的业务技术一时用不上，甚至因此生疏起来。但是只要自己锻炼好了，有了为人民服务的思想，将来不仅温习业务技术容易，就是学起新的技术来，也要比过去容易得多，这也是件划得来的事情。
    1月5日人民日报上“红军老团长解甲当农民”的报道中，方和明说了一段划得来和划不来的话。话虽不多，但讲得很好。当有人向他提出不当团长当农民划不来的问题后，方和明说：“谁说划不来呢？我过去给人家当长工，受压迫，几辈子受穷，我参加革命，打垮了敌人，现在回到自己的土地上劳动生产，这才划得来嗳！若说这划不来，牺牲了的同志更划不来，假若都照你那样打算，今天的革命胜利从哪里来？”
    好，问得对！如果不进行革命，不把帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三大敌人打垮，你能活到现在吗？即使你能活到现在，你能在自己土地上好好劳动吗？你能好好工作吗？你能好好学习吗？如果不打垮敌人，新民主主义革命能成功吗？社会主义革命能胜利吗？共产主义能建设吗？
    所以有人说划不来，只是从个人利益来看。在这些人看来，对个人有利，并且利大的就是划得来，而对人民有利，并且利大的就是划不来。这样来比较，这样来分析，那么连这些个人主义者，生在这个社会里，也是划不来的。因为这个社会是根本反对资产阶级的个人主义，提倡社会主义的集体主义的，而这些人是为了讲究个人的吃、穿而来到人间的。生不逢时，真是大大的划不来！
    难　似　移　山　倒　海
    用人民的勤务员几个字来解释共产党员、革命工作人员同人民的关系，这本来已经很明了的了，但是还有些人不大清楚。
    好了，“红军老团长解甲当农民”的报道中，也有一段话可以作为这个问题的注解。那就是方和明说的：过去需要打仗，我就打仗；现在需要种地，我就种地。谁需要呢？人民需要。共产党员、革命工作人员同人民的关系就是这样，人民需要做什么，就做什么，而且做得好；人民不需要做什么，就不做什么，而且劝别人也不做！能这样做就是好勤务员。
    现在有不少共产党员、革命工作人员虽然自称是人民的勤务员，但却不能按着上述的原则去做。这次上山下乡就是一例。明明上山下乡，是人民需要做的一件事情，这件事情，不独对人民有好处，为人民培养出一批经得起风险的优秀的革命工作人员；就是对本人也是好处说不尽的，原来是个半知识分子，经过劳动锻炼就可成为完全的知识分子；原来是“五谷不分”“四体不勤”的知识分子，经过劳动锻炼就可成为既有文化科学知识又有劳动生产经验的知识分子。但是有些人就是不愿上山下乡去锻炼，并且向人民提出了许许多多的责问。
    当人民勤务员对一些人来说，很容易，但对另一些人来说却很难，难到好似移山倒海。
