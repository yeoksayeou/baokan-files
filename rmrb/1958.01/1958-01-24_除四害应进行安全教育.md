	Safety Education Should Be Conducted for Eliminating the Four Pests
	Some units only focus on the sudden elimination of the four pests, but neglect safety education, thus causing adverse consequences. A comrade in the Tongcheng County Education and Rehabilitation Institute in Anhui Province used a homemade gun to shoot sparrows, resulting in a head injury. More seriously, a comrade from the clock shop in Chengguan Town, Tongcheng County, loaded a homemade gun with gunpowder, preparing to shoot sparrows. However, while walking on a small hillside, he accidentally fell, and the gunpowder exploded, killing him. Situations like the above have occurred more than once since Tongcheng County launched the Eliminate the Four Pests campaign (but only one person was killed). Although the Tongcheng County Eliminate the Four Pests Headquarters conducted inspections and issued circulars for each accident, some units still did not learn from the lessons and did not conduct safety education for eliminating the four pests, so accidents continued to occur. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the Eliminate the Four Pests campaign, I suggest that all localities learn from the lessons and strengthen safety education for eliminating the four pests.

    除四害应进行安全教育
    某些单位只顾突击除四害，却忽视了安全教育，因而造成不良的后果。安徽省桐城县教养院有一个同志用土枪打麻雀，结果把自己头部打伤了。严重的是桐城县城关镇钟表店的一个同志，他把土枪火药装好了，准备射击麻雀。但由于走在小山坡子上，不小心摔下来，当时火药爆炸了，把自己打死。像以上情况，在桐城县开展除四害运动以来，并不是一次，而是多次（打死的只有一个）。虽然桐城县除四害指挥部对每次事故的发生，都作了检查和通报。但是，某些单位仍不接受教训，没有进行除四害的安全教育，所以事故仍旧不断发生。为了使除四害运动能够顺利开展，我建议各地应吸取教训，加强除四害的安全教育。　		安徽桐城荣军教养院　天亮
