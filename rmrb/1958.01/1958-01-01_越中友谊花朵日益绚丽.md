    The Flowers of Vietnam-China Friendship are Blooming More Splendidly Day by Day
    Pei Ji, President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association
    The annual spring has arrived, and the spring breeze and rain make the flowers of Vietnam-China friendship even more fragrant and splendid. In an atmosphere where the peaceful calls of the two declarations still echo, we all feel joyful and excited when we wholeheartedly admire the blooming and magnificent flowers.
    Looking back at the past year—1957, the people of our fraternal countries of Vietnam and China have made great efforts in cultivating these flowers of friendship.
    Many delegations sent by the Chinese people to Vietnam and delegations sent by the Vietnamese people to China have further strengthened the long-standing inherent relationship between the two countries. The governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China have also signed many agreements on cultural exchange and economic cooperation. The Vietnamese people believe that this is one of the factors that makes the cause of building the motherland and consolidating the fraternal unity between socialist countries successful.
    In fulfilling the agreements signed by the two governments, many cultural and economic activities have been carried out in Vietnam and China.
    The Vietnamese people will always remember that when the Vietnamese people were joyfully welcoming the Lunar New Year of Ding You, the Harbin Pingju Opera Troupe came to Vietnam. The arrival of the Pingju Opera Troupe made the Vietnamese people's Lunar New Year more enjoyable, and it brought the Vietnamese people the encouraging power to vigorously promote the construction of the motherland and the defense of peace in all aspects. On the occasion of commemorating the founding of the People's Republic of China, a Chinese Arts and Crafts Exhibition was held in Vietnam. This exhibition introduced to the Vietnamese people the long history of handicraft art and the creative spirit of the Chinese working people.
    On the occasion of commemorating the founding of the Vietnam People's Army, the "August 1st" Football Team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army visited Vietnam. The visit of the "August 1st" Football Team further strengthened the friendship between the people's armies of the two countries.
    The visits of the Vietnamese people's table tennis team and art troupe to China have brought the Vietnamese people's cordial greetings of friendship and respect to the Chinese people, and at the same time, they have learned valuable experience from China's famous actors and athletes.
    The above is the development of relations between the two countries in 1957. On the occasion of the New Year, we would like to introduce to our friends the achievements we have made in 1957. The achievement of these accomplishments is inseparable from the selfless and generous assistance of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries, and it makes the friendship garden of socialist countries more and more splendid.
    In terms of industry, many enterprises and mines have completed their 1957 plans ahead of schedule. For example, the Guan Chao Coal Mine completed the plan twenty-five days ahead of schedule, the Nan Dinh Textile Factory completed the plan eight days ahead of schedule, and the Tongyi Match Factory completed the plan ten days ahead of schedule.
    In terms of industrial construction, many factories have entered the production stage, such as the Phu Tho Tea Factory and the Yi An Power Plant; the Hanoi Rice Mill built with the help of the Chinese people and several other rice mills have recently started production.
    In terms of agriculture, the autumn harvest of 1957, which was also the last year of our economic recovery plan, has been successfully completed. Although the seasons were not favorable in 1957, many places still had high yields.
    The movement of exchanging labor and mutual assistance has been consolidated and developed. The entire north has restored and consolidated 85,691 work exchange groups with 685,528 laboring peasant households. The consolidation of the work exchange and mutual assistance movement has had a good impact on agricultural production in 1957.
    In terms of education, the mass education movement has been vigorously promoted. Many villages have eliminated illiteracy. In Ninh Binh Province, the number of people mobilized to attend mass education classes reached 12,000 in just one month, of which 9,000 were just starting school.
    Vietnam was liberated later than China, but in a short period of time, it has also achieved victories in various fields. This is mainly due to our own efforts, but also due to the practical experience of China and the enthusiastic assistance of the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union.
    Entering the New Year of 1958, in addition to the common tasks of building socialism and defending world peace, the Vietnamese and Chinese people will continue to carry out a similar sacred task: the Chinese people are striving to return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland, and the Vietnamese people are fighting to achieve unification through peaceful means. In this struggle, the people of the two countries have an extremely powerful force, which is the friendly unity in the socialist family of nations. The Vietnamese people and the Chinese people have such a firm and strong belief that our struggle will eventually be victorious.
    On the occasion of the New Year, on behalf of all members of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government headed by the esteemed Chairman Mao Zedong, wishing the Chinese people many new achievements in realizing the Second Five-Year Plan, building socialism, unifying the motherland, and defending peace. May the friendship between Vietnam and China be increasingly consolidated and developed.

### 越中友谊花朵日益绚丽

    越中友谊花朵日益绚丽
    越中友好协会会长　裴纪
    一年一度的春天来了，春风春雨把越中友谊的花朵衬托得更加芬芳灿烂。在两项宣言的和平呼声仍在回荡的气氛中，来倾心地观赏朵朵开放的绚丽花朵，我们无不感到欢欣雀跃。
    回顾过去一年——1957年，我们兄弟之邦越中两国的人民，在对这些友谊花朵的培育上已经作出了很大的努力。
    中国人民派到越南来的许多代表团和越南人民派到中国去的代表团，已经使两国之间悠久的固有关系更加紧密起来。越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国两国政府之间还签订了许多文化交流和经济合作的协定。越南人民认为这是使建设祖国和巩固各社会主义国家之间兄弟般的团结的事业成功的因素之一。
    履行两国政府所签订的协定，在越南和中国已经进行了许多文化、经济活动。
    越南人民永远记着：当越南人民正在欢欣鼓舞迎接丁酉年春节的时候，哈尔滨评剧团到了越南。评剧团的到来，使越南人民的春节过得更加愉快，它给越南人民带来了大力推进建设祖国和保卫和平各方面活动的鼓舞力量。在纪念中华人民共和国成立日的时候，在越南举办了中国美术工艺品展览会。这个展览会向越南人民介绍了中国劳动人民的历史悠久的手工美术工艺和创造精神。
    在纪念越南人民军建军节时，中国人民解放军“八一”足球队访问了越南。“八一”足球队的访问使两国人民军队之间的友谊更加紧密起来。
    越南人民的乒乓球队和文工团等对中国的访问，已经将越南人民亲切友谊的问候和敬意带给了中国人民，同时向中国的著名演员和运动员学习到了宝贵的经验。
    以上是1957年两国之间关系的发展。值此新年，我们谨向各位朋友介绍一下我们在1957年所取得的成就。这些成就的取得是与苏联、中国和各兄弟国家的人民无私、慷慨的援助分不开的，它更把社会主义各国的友谊花园衬托得日益绚丽。
    在工业方面，许多企业和矿山已经提前完成了1957年计划。例如：关潮煤矿提前二十五天完成了计划，南定纺织厂提前八天完成了计划，统一火柴厂提前十天完成了计划。
    在工业建设方面，许多工厂已经进入生产的阶段，如富寿茶厂、宜安发电厂；由中国人民帮助我们建设的河内辗米厂以及其他几个辗米厂，最近也已开始生产。
    在农业方面，1957年秋收，同时也是我们经济恢复计划的最后一年的秋收，已经胜利完成。尽管1957年的时令不顺，许多地方还是产量很高。
    变工互助运动已经得到巩固和发展。整个北方已经恢复和巩固了拥有六十八万五千五百二十八户劳动农民的八万五千六百九十一个变工组。变工互助运动的巩固，对1957年农业生产起了良好的影响。
    在教育方面，民众教育运动已经得到大力的推进。许多乡已经扫除了文盲。在宁平省，仅在一个月里，被发动上民众教育班的人数就已经达到一万二千人，其中有九千人是刚开始上学的。
    越南比中国解放得晚，但是在短期间也在各方面取得了胜利，这主要是由于我们本身的努力，但也由于有了中国的实际经验以及中国人民和以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的各国人民的热情援助。
    进入1958年新年，越南人民和中国人民除了建设社会主义和保卫世界和平共同的任务外，还要继续进行一个相似的神圣任务：中国人民为使台湾回到祖国的怀抱，越南人民为通过和平道路实现统一而斗争。在这一斗争中，两国人民有一个极其强大的力量，就是社会主义各国大家庭中的友好团结。越南人民和中国人民都具有这样坚定强烈的信念：我们的斗争终将取得胜利。
    值此新年，我谨代表越中友好协会全体会员，向中国人民和以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党和中国政府致以最热烈的祝贺，祝中国人民在实现第二个五年计划，建设社会主义、统一祖国和保卫和平的事业中取得许多新的成就，祝越中友谊日益巩固和发展。
