    Two Good Examples

    Today's People's Daily publishes news about the diligent and thrifty study habits of students at the Third Junior Middle School in Changge County, Henan, and the amateur junior middle school at the Qunli Farm in Renhuai County, Guizhou, providing us with two good examples. This is a concrete manifestation of students responding to the Party Central Committee's call for building the country and running schools through diligence and thrift, and it is a meaningful thing worthy of vigorous promotion.

    Promoting diligent and thrifty study methods in schools at all levels is a major event in reforming the study atmosphere and further promoting the vigorous development of education in our country. Since liberation, the state has set up people's scholarships in various types of schools to help the children of workers and peasants and other young people with difficult family finances to enroll in school. During the First Five-Year Plan period alone, more than 300 million yuan was spent on scholarships for middle school students. However, in recent years, with the improvement of people's living standards and the increasing number of students, it is of course impossible and inappropriate to continue to demand that the state take on all the students' difficulties and increase scholarships indefinitely. In order to save state expenditures on the one hand and ensure the students' living needs on the other, the best way is to advocate work-study programs, so that students can use their labor income to solve all or part of their learning and living expenses. The practice of the Third Junior Middle School in Changge County proves that this method is entirely feasible. According to the statistics of 606 students in the school during the 1957 summer vacation, they earned more than 325,000 work points in 80 days of labor, equivalent to more than 16,000 yuan in Renminbi. Relying on this income, the number of students receiving scholarships was reduced from 549 to 324, saving the state more than 3,000 yuan. This can not only effectively cultivate students' spirit of self-reliance and overcome the idea of relying on the state for everything, but also reduce the economic burden of the state in running schools and families in supporting their children's education, and enable more children from poor families to have the opportunity to enroll in school. If this method can be done in the Third Junior Middle School in Changge, there is no reason why other schools cannot do it.

    The more important and far-reaching significance of implementing this method of working while studying and practicing work-study programs lies in cultivating solid labor concepts and habits through labor, increasing students' production knowledge and living abilities, and further improving students' political and ideological awareness. The 289 students in six classes of the third grade of Changge Third Junior Middle School have learned all the techniques of close planting of wheat, intercropping of corn and soybeans, and tobacco planting as a result of their labor in the experimental garden for three years. 280 people learned how to level the land and turn over seedlings, 240 people learned how to press melon vines and various basic knowledge, 151 people learned how to manage and collect sweet potatoes, 55 people learned how to plow, 32 people learned how to harrow, and 30 people learned how to plant vernalized wheat and corn. After a long period of labor, the students' thoughts and feelings have also undergone great changes. In the past, they thought that going to school was a means of getting rid of physical labor, and they did not want to return to the countryside after coming from the countryside. Now? Whenever students return to school on holidays, they always go to their cultivated areas first and love their crops like farmers. They also said, "I don't feel comfortable if I don't work for a day." The nearby farmers' comment on the students of this school is: "This foreign school is different from other schools. It is a model of work-study in school, and a genuine new-style farmer out of school." Therefore, this method is an important way to concretely realize the combination of educated youth and workers and peasants, and the combination of mental and physical labor; it is a good way to completely change the bad habits left over from the old society of despising physical labor and working people, and to cultivate students into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

    Some people who hold bourgeois educational views emphasize that participating in physical labor will affect the "normal order" of the school and affect "students' studies." They do not support students' work-study programs, but instead criticize them in various ways; they only pay attention to knowledge impartation, ignore ideological education, only pay attention to classroom teaching, and ignore the combination with actual productive labor. However, the facts are exactly the opposite of what these well-intentioned people think. In all schools where work-study programs are well implemented, students' achievements in all aspects are also excellent. The examples of the above two schools are proof of this.

    Changge County Third Junior Middle School and Renhuai County Qunli Farm Amateur Junior Middle School have put forward ways for students to participate in labor according to specific conditions. Of course, these methods may not be entirely suitable for every school. But in general, there are many opportunities and ways for students to participate in labor. Holidays are a good time for students to participate in labor. Rural schools or schools close to rural areas can organize students whose homes are in rural areas to return home to participate in agricultural production during holidays. For students whose homes are in cities, the school's Communist Youth League and student union can be responsible for organizing student labor teams to participate in some labor in agricultural cooperatives or basic construction sites; they can also be organized to participate in urban social service labor. In addition to holiday labor, after school starts, schools can also establish a contact system with off-campus production units and organize students to take turns to carry out voluntary labor and participate in some paid labor in a regular manner during after-school hours or holidays. In schools, various experimental gardens, experimental factories, handicrafts, side occupations, school construction labor and self-service labor can also be organized. For things within the school, students can be organized to do as much as possible; students should be encouraged to manage their own affairs, learn production technology, and cultivate the ability to live independently. In addition to participating in labor, a thrift campaign should also be carried out among all students to truly cultivate a hard-working and simple style.

    Work-study programs, working while studying, are a fine tradition of revolutionary intellectuals in our country. The youth of New China should inherit and carry forward this tradition. The administration, Communist Youth League, and student union of each school should cooperate closely, act in a unified manner, and provide good guidance and arrangements for young students to carry out labor. At present, schools in various places have successively started winter vacations. It is hoped that a wave of student participation in labor and practice will be set off during the winter vacation, laying a good foundation for further forming a work-study atmosphere among students nationwide.

### 两个好榜样

    两个好榜样
    本报今天发表的河南长葛县第三初中、贵州仁怀县群力农场业余初级中学学生勤俭求学的新闻，给我们提供了两个好的榜样。这是学生们响应党中央勤俭建国、勤俭办学号召的具体表现，是一件有意义的值得大力提倡的事情。
    在各级学校中推行勤俭求学的办法，是革新学习风气，进一步促进我国教育事业蓬勃发展的一件大事。解放以来，国家为了帮助工农子女和其它家庭经济困难的青年入学，在各类学校设置了人民助学金。第一个五年计划期间，仅中学生的助学金，就支出了三亿多元。但是，几年来，随着人民生活水平的提高，学生的人数愈来愈多，在这种情况下，当然不能也不应当继续要求国家把学生的困难全部包下来，无限制地增加助学金。为了一方面节约国家开支，一方面保证学生的生活需要，最好的办法就是提倡勤工俭学，使学生以自己的劳动收入解决自己全部或一部分学习和生活的费用。河南长葛县第三初中的实践，证明这种办法是完全可行的。据该校1957年暑假六百零六个学生的统计，八十天的劳动共挣工分三十二万五千多个，合人民币一万六千多元。依靠这笔收入，使享受助学金的学生由五百四十九人，降低到三百二十四人，为国家节约了开支三千多元。这不仅能够有效地培养学生自力更生的精神，克服事事依赖国家的思想，同时可以减轻国家办学校和家庭供养子女读书的经济负担，并能使更多的家庭贫苦的子弟获得入校求学的机会。这种办法，在长葛第三初中既能办到，别的学校就没有理由办不到。
    实行这种一面劳动、一面读书、勤工俭学方法的更主要的更深远的意义，还在于通过劳动养成牢固的劳动观念和劳动习惯，增加学生的生产知识和生活能力，并进而提高学生的政治思想觉悟。长葛第三初中三年级六个班二百八十九个学生，三年来在实验园地劳动的结果，全部学会了小麦密植、玉米和大豆间作、种烟等项技术。有二百八十人学会整地翻秧，二百四十人学会南瓜压秧和各种基本知识，一百五十一人学会管理收藏甘薯，五十五人学会犁地，三十二人学会耙地，三十人学会种春化小麦和玉米。经过长期劳动，学生在思想情感上也起了很大的变化。过去认为上学是摆脱体力劳动的手段，从农村来而不愿回农村去。现在呢？学生每逢假日回校，总要先到自己的耕作区，像农民一样地热爱自己的禾苗。还说：“一天不劳动就不舒服了。”附近的农民对这所学校的学生的评语是：“这所洋学堂和别的学校不一样，在校是勤工俭学的模范、出校是地地道道的新式农民。”所以说，这种办法是具体实现知识青年和工农相结合、脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的一个重要途径；是彻底改变旧社会遗留下来的鄙视体力劳动和劳动人民的恶习，培养学生成为具有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者的好办法。
    有些持有资产阶级教育观点的人，强调什么参加体力劳动会影响学校的“正常秩序”和影响“学生的学习”。他们不支持学生勤工俭学，而是指手划脚地多方面指责；他们只注意知识传授，忽视思想教育，只注意课堂教学，忽视同实际生产劳动的结合。但是，事实恰恰与这些好心肠的人的想法相反，凡是勤工俭学实行得好的学校，学生各方面的成绩也都优良。以上两个学校的实例就是证明。
    长葛县第三初中和仁怀县群力农场业余初中，他们根据具体的条件提出了学生参加劳动的方式，这些方式，当然不一定完全适合每一所学校。但是总的说来，学生参加劳动的时机和门路都是很多的。假期是学生参加劳动的良好时机。农村或接近农村的学校，在假期可以组织家在农村的学生回家参加农业生产。家在城市的学生，可以由学校的共青团和学生会负责组织学生劳动队，到农业社或基本建设工地去参加部分劳动；也可以组织他们参加城市社会服务劳动。除假期劳动以外，在开学以后，学校也可以和校外生产单位建立联系制度，利用课余或假日，组织学生轮流地定期地进行义务劳动和参加一部分有报酬的劳动。在学校中，也可以组织多种多样的实验园地、实验工厂、手工业、副业、建校劳动和自我服务性的劳动。校内的事情，凡是学生能办的可以尽量组织学生去办；倡导学生自己管理自己的事情，学会生产技术和培养独立生活的能力。除了参加劳动以外，还应当在全体学生中开展节约运动，使学生真正养成艰苦朴素的作风。
    勤工俭学，一面劳动，一面读书，是我国革命知识分子的一个优良传统。新中国的青年，应该继承和发扬这个传统。各学校的行政、共青团和学生会更应当密切配合，统一行动，很好地辅导和安排青年学生进行劳动。目前，各地学校已经先后放寒假了，希望在寒假中掀起学生参加劳动锻炼的热潮，为进一步在全国学生中形成勤工俭学的风气打下良好的基础。
