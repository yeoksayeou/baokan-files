Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 9th: Yong'an County and the Zhiping District of Ninghua County in Fujian Province, formerly areas severely plagued by malaria, have now basically eliminated the disease.

Yong'an County is located in the mountainous region of central Fujian, with high mountains and dense forests, allowing mosquitoes to breed rapidly. Before liberation, out of the county's population of over 70,000, more than 30,000 suffered from malaria each year, and many died from malignant malaria. After liberation, the state successively allocated large amounts of funds and anti-malaria drugs, and sent a large number of medical and health personnel to the mountains and villages to help the masses overcome the disease. Since 1953, the county has successively launched mass patriotic health campaigns and the "eliminate the four pests" movement, vigorously carrying out mosquito eradication and malaria prevention work, eliminating more than 2,700 catties of adult and larval mosquitoes. Now, in Yong'an County, every household repairs ditches, drains sewage, regularly clears weeds around houses, and disinfects drinking water regularly, eradicating mosquito breeding grounds. Not only has the incidence of malaria been rapidly reduced, but other diseases have also been significantly reduced, and the population has increased from over 70,000 before liberation to over 110,000 now.

Currently, the people of the county are combining water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and other production movements to launch a new upsurge in eliminating the "four pests," striving to completely eliminate malaria within four years and become a "four-free" county.

The Zhiping District of Ninghua County is sparsely populated, with only 2,347 able-bodied laborers in the entire district. Labor shortage is a major difficulty in developing production. Moreover, malaria used to be prevalent throughout the year. 60% of adults suffered from malaria, and each person lost at least ten days of work for each bout, with some having more than one bout a year. In 1957, the Zhiping District regarded malaria eradication as one of the main keys to solving the labor problem in mountainous areas. Starting in February, it persisted in carrying out a mass mosquito eradication and anti-malaria campaign, which resulted in basically eliminating mosquitoes. The incidence of malaria was greatly reduced, and almost no one suffered from bouts of fever. Last year, farmers worked more than 20,000 labor days more than in the past.

The basic experience of the Zhiping District in mosquito eradication and malaria prevention is the strengthening of leadership by the Party committee, following the mass line, and close technical cooperation of medical workers. Various measures for mosquito eradication and malaria prevention in this district are led by Party members, cadres, and activists, who demonstrate practical results before promoting them among the masses.

After the masses in the Zhiping District achieved victory in eliminating malaria, they have high confidence in eliminating the "four pests." They have now begun to strive to completely eliminate mosquitoes and flies this year, while vigorously eliminating rats and sparrows.

### 家家讲卫生，根除了蚊蚋生殖的场所  福建两山区基本上消灭疟疾

    家家讲卫生，根除了蚊蚋生殖的场所
    福建两山区基本上消灭疟疾
    新华社福州9日电　福建省的永安县和宁化县的治平区，过去是两个疟疾严重流行的地区，现在都已经基本上消灭了疟疾。
    永安县地处福建中部山区，境内山高林密，蚊蚋孳生很快，解放以前，全县七万多人中，每年患疟疾的达三万多人次，有许多人因患恶性疟疾死亡。解放后国家先后拨出大批款项和抗疟药品，派出大批医务卫生人员上山下乡帮助群众战胜疾病。1953年以来，这个县又相继开展群众性的爱国卫生运动和除四害运动，大力进行了除蚊灭疟工作，先后共消灭了蚊蝇成虫和幼虫二千七百多斤。现在永安县家家修阴沟，户户排污水，经常清除房屋周围杂草，定期进行饮水消毒，根除了蚊蚋生殖的场所，不仅疟疾发病率迅速降低，其他疾病也显著减少，人口已由解放前的七万多人增加到现在的十一万多人。
    目前，全县人民正结合兴修水利、积肥等生产运动，掀起一个新的除四害高潮，争取在四年内彻底消灭疟疾病患，并成为“四无”县。
    宁化县治平区地广人稀，全区全劳力只有二千三百四十七人，劳力不足是发展生产中很大的困难，而且以往全年都流行疟疾，成年人患疟疾的占60％，每人打一次摆子至少停工十天，有的人一年还不止打一次。1957年治平区把扑灭疟疾作为解决山区劳力问题的主要关键之一，从2月份起坚持开展群众性的灭蚊抗疟运动，结果基本上消灭了蚊子，疟疾的发病率大大减少，几乎很少有人打摆子，去年一年中农民比过去多作了两万多个劳动日。
    治平区灭蚊抗疟的基本经验是党委加强领导、走群众路线和医务工作者在技术上密切配合。这个区灭蚊抗疟的各项措施都是由党员、干部和积极分子带头，作出实际效果后，再在群众中推广。
    治平区群众取得消灭疟疾的胜利后，对除“四害”的信心很高，现在已着手争取今年内彻底消灭蚊子、苍蝇，同时大力消灭老鼠、麻雀。
