Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 28th: The Guizhou Provincial Planning, System, and Mountain Production Conference, which lasted twenty-two days and closed on the 27th, announced that the planned total grain output of Guizhou Province would reach 18 billion jin by 1962, an increase of 72.4% compared to 1957, achieving the target of 800 jin of grain per mu proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) five years ahead of schedule.

This plan was formulated by the representatives of various special districts, autonomous prefectures, and counties attending the conference after fully discussing the guidelines for developing mountain production and criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking in past work.

The meeting believed that to realize this plan, all aspects must take many measures. First, agricultural irrigation must be realized throughout the province to change the unfavorable conditions of high mountains and low water. The meeting decided to mobilize the masses to build a large number of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects during the Second Five-Year Plan period, striving to expand the irrigated area by 17 million mu, and to establish a total of 50,000 horsepower of mechanical pumping stations in a planned way, so that water conservancy can gradually move up the mountains and turn sloping land into terraced fields. Reclamation should be restricted to prevent soil erosion, and measures should be taken immediately to control the existing 17,000 square kilometers of soil erosion area.

Second, to change the thin and barren soil conditions in mountainous areas, it is necessary to widely develop fertilizer sources and strive to apply 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu within two or three years. In addition to advocating large-scale pig raising and manure accumulation in rural areas, counties and cities throughout the province should plan to establish a number of small and medium-sized chemical fertilizer factories, gradually providing 300,000 tons of chemical fertilizer annually, turning more than 10 million mu of thin and barren land in the province into fertile land.

Third, according to the backward agricultural technology in various parts of Guizhou Province, production technology reforms should also be implemented. Efforts should be made to strengthen the technical teams of agricultural cooperatives, promote new agricultural tools, improve cultivation methods, and promote improved varieties. It is required that machinery be sent to the countryside, and simple machinery should be promoted as much as possible in various labors. For example, in rural transportation, various handcarts and animal-powered vehicles can be promoted to improve labor efficiency.

The representatives attending the meeting believed that although the realization of this plan is very arduous, with the great victory achieved in the anti-rightist struggle of the people of the province, socialist education has been widely carried out in rural areas, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for building socialism has been unprecedentedly high, it can be completed by relying on the strong leadership of the Party.

    贵州粮食产量将有大跃进
    争取提前五年达到全国农业发展纲要指标
    新华社贵阳28日电　历时二十二天于27日闭幕的贵州省计划、体制、山区生产会议，宣布了贵州省粮食总产量计划到1962年达到一百八十亿斤，比1957年增长72.4％，提前五年达到全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）提出的每亩产粮八百斤的指标。
    这个计划是出席这次会议的各专区、自治州、县的代表，充分讨论发展山区生产的方针，批判了过去工作中的右倾保守思想以后订出的。
    会议认为，要实现这个计划，各方面都必须采取许多措施。首先要在全省范围内实现农田水利化，改变山高水低的不利条件。会议决定在第二个五年计划期内，发动群众兴修大批小型农田水利工程，争取扩大灌溉面积一千七百万亩，并有计划地建立共五万马力的机械提水站，使水利逐步上山，把坡土变为梯田。对于开荒要加以限制，以防止水土流失，现有的一万七千平方公里的水土流失地区要立即采取措施加以控制。
    其次，为了改变山区土质瘦瘠的状况，要广泛开辟肥源，争取两三年内每亩地施肥量达到一万斤。除了在农村中提倡大量养猪积肥外，省内各地县、市要有计划地建立一批中小型化学肥料工厂，逐步做到每年提供三十万吨化学肥料，把全省一千多万亩瘦田瘦土变成肥田肥土。
    再次，根据贵州省各地农业技术落后的情况，还要实行生产技术改革。要努力壮大农业社的技术队伍，推广新式农具，改进耕作方法和推广良种。要求机械下乡，在各种劳动中尽量推广简单机械。如农村运输上，就可推广各种手推车和兽力车，提高劳动效率。
    到会代表认为：实现这个计划虽然十分艰巨，但在全省人民反右派斗争已取得伟大胜利，农村中广泛进行了社会主义教育，广大农民建设社会主义的积极性空前高涨的情况下，依靠党的坚强领导是可以完成的。
