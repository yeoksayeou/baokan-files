    ·Editor's Note·
    On the industrial and agricultural production fronts, there are promoters and obstructors, and in the work of streamlining institutions, there are also promoters and obstructors. Promoters advocate thorough revolution, streamlining institutions to the point where they cannot be streamlined any further, and digging out the work potential of each person to give full play to their role. Obstructors, on the other hand, believe that "revolution" cannot be "revolutionized again" after it has been done once, and that streamlining cannot be streamlined any further after it has been done once. If it is to be streamlined again, then it can only be a matter of "doing as much as we have people to do."
    Among the promoters, there are leaders and the masses, and among the obstructors, there are also leaders and the masses. Because some leading cadres are among the obstructors, it is not so easy for the promoters to fight and persuade the obstructors, and they will encounter resistance. What's more, at the beginning, the promoters' opinions may not be very perfect, and the reasons and bases may not be sufficient, perhaps it is just a good budding idea; while the obstructors are very likely to explain their reasoning in a well-organized and convincing way, based on past rules and experiences, thus capturing the hearts of the people. In this situation, should we adopt a promoting approach or an obstructing approach, a thorough revolution or a revolution that is "good enough"? It is very necessary for the higher-level leadership to express a clear attitude and give strong support to the promoters. That is to say, the higher-level leading comrades should go deep, seriously study and analyze the various situations and the opinions of both sides, grasp the active and correct factors in the promoters' opinions, and support and encourage them to realize them.
    In the railway ministry's freight bureau's latest streamlining of institutions, a debate took place between the promoters and the obstructors. This debate, thanks to the support of the ministry's rectification leadership group and the administrative leaders of the freight bureau, the promoters' opinions were supplemented, developed, and perfected through mass debate, and the ranks of the promoters became larger and larger. Finally, they persuaded the "obstructors" with conservative ideas to agree to revise the original plan to streamline the existing 109 people to 75 people into a plan to streamline to 60 people, and began to implement it.
    The key to the freight bureau's ability to formulate a revolutionary plan to streamline institutions lies in the fact that the promoters' opinions were supported by higher-level leaders, and the reason why higher-level leaders were able to adopt the attitude of supporting the promoters was that they seriously studied and analyzed the promoters' opinions and were not swayed by the "obstructing" opinions of some people, including some middle-level leading cadres. This is very important. If the leadership is clueless about the promoters' opinions, it is easy to be fooled by the obstructors and unwittingly play a role in obstructing progress. Therefore, the practice of the railway ministry's freight bureau in streamlining institutions is worthy of attention.

    也谈“促进”和“促退”
    ·编者的话·
    在工农业生产战线上有促进派和促退派，在机关里紧缩机构的工作中也有促进派和促退派。促进派主张彻底革命，把机构紧缩到不能再紧缩的地步，把每一个人的工作潜力都挖出来，充分发挥每个人的作用。促退派则不然，他们认为“革过命”就不能“再革命”了，已经紧缩过就不能再紧缩了，如果再要紧缩，那就只能“有多少人办多少事”了。
    促进派当中有领导也有群众，促退派里头也有领导和群众。因为促退派里头有一部分领导干部，促进派要和促退派进行斗争，要说服促退派，就不那么容易，就会遇到阻力。何况，开始的时候，促进派的意见可能不很完善，理由和根据不一定充分，也许仅仅是个好的萌芽；而促退派却很有可能根据过去的章程、经验，把自己的道理讲得头头是道，深入人心。在这种情况下，究竟应该采取促进的办法还是促退的办法，是彻底革命还是革命得“差不多”就算了？十分需要上一级领导来表示明确的态度，给促进派以有力的支持。这就是说，上一级的领导同志应该深入下去，认真研究分析各方面的情况和双方的意见，抓住促进派意见中积极的、正确的因素，加以支持和鼓励，使之实现。
    铁道部货运局这次再度紧缩机构，促进派和促退派就发生过一场争论。这场争论，由于部的整风领导小组和货运局行政领导干部的支持，促进派的意见经过群众性的辩论，补充、发挥得更完善、更健全了，促进派的队伍也愈来愈大了，最后终于说服了有保守思想的“促退派”，同意把原订由现有的一百零九人紧缩到七十五人的方案，修改成为紧缩到六十人的方案，并且开始付诸实施了。
    货运局所以能够订出革命的紧缩机构的方案，关键就在于促进派的意见得到了上级领导的支持，而上级领导之所以能够采取支持促进派的态度，又在于认真研究分析了促进派的意见，没有被一部分人、包括有些中层领导干部的“促退”意见所左右。这一点很重要，如果领导上对促进派的意见心中无数，就很容易上促退派的当，自己也不自觉地起了促退作用。因此，铁道部货运局紧缩机构的作法，值得引起注意。
