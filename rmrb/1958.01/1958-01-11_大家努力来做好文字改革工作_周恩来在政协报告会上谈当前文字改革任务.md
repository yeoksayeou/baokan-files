Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a report meeting in the CPPCC Auditorium this morning, where CPPCC National Committee Chairman Zhou Enlai delivered a report on "Current Tasks of Language Reform." Those attending today's report meeting included deputies to the National People's Congress in Beijing, members of the CPPCC National Committee in Beijing, heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations, senior intellectuals from government departments, professors and lecturers from major universities in Beijing, librarians from the Central Research Institute of Culture and History, as well as figures from the literary and art circles, and heads of newspaper offices, publishing houses, and magazines, totaling nearly three thousand people.

In his report, Chairman Zhou Enlai pointed out that the three current tasks of language reform are: simplifying Chinese characters, promoting Mandarin Chinese, and formulating and implementing the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. He said that since the "Chinese Character Simplification Scheme" was promulgated by the State Council in January 1956, simplified characters have been widely used in newspapers, periodicals, textbooks, and general books, and have been welcomed by the broad masses, who find them convenient. Standing on the position of the broad masses of the people, we should affirm the work of simplifying Chinese characters. He pointed out that the principle of "popular convention and gradual progress" adopted in the work of simplifying Chinese characters is correct, but there are still some areas where considerations are not comprehensive in specific work, and a few simplified characters are not properly used in application, which can be modified as necessary in the future. Currently, there are still some chaotic phenomena in the use of simplified characters in society, which should be appropriately controlled. Especially in printed materials, the abuse of simplified characters must be prevented. However, he said that from the history of Chinese characters, multiple forms of a single character have existed since the oracle bone inscriptions. Today, the broad masses are beginning to master writing and urgently demand language reform, which has not happened in any dynasty in history. The formulation of the "Chinese Character Simplification Scheme" aims to guide the chaos to a unified standard. He pointed out that the simplification of Chinese characters will not hinder the love of calligraphy. Calligraphy is an art and, of course, can be free from the restrictions of Chinese character simplification.

Chairman Zhou Enlai said that the second task of Chinese simplification is to promote Mandarin Chinese. There is a very serious dialectal divergence in the language of the Han nationality in our country, mainly in terms of pronunciation. This dialectal divergence has brought unfavorable effects on the political, economic, and cultural life of our people. Therefore, vigorously promoting Mandarin Chinese with Beijing pronunciation as the standard sound among the nearly 600 million Han people in our country is an important political task. Since the National Language Reform Conference in October 1955, the promotion of Mandarin Chinese has achieved certain results. Currently, more than 700,000 primary and secondary school Chinese language teachers across the country have received Mandarin pronunciation training. A large proportion of primary and secondary schools across the country have begun to use Mandarin Chinese for teaching. More than two million people across the country are listening to the Mandarin pronunciation teaching broadcasts organized by the Central People's Broadcasting Station. He pointed out that promoting Mandarin Chinese with Beijing pronunciation as the standard sound does not require all Han people to speak like Beijingers, which is neither possible nor necessary. Beijing pronunciation is a standard, and having a standard means having a direction. In specific promotion and teaching work, there should be different requirements for different objects. First of all, it should be vigorously promoted in schools, among children and young people. He said that promoting Mandarin Chinese is not to prohibit or eliminate dialects. Dialects will exist for a long time and cannot be prohibited by administrative orders, nor can they be eliminated by artificial means. We promote Mandarin Chinese in order to eliminate the barriers between dialects. He pointed out that unifying the dialects of the Han people is an arduous task that requires long-term and unremitting efforts.

When Chairman Zhou Enlai spoke about the third task of formulating and promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, he pointed out that the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is used to annotate Chinese characters and promote Mandarin Chinese, and it is not a phonetic script to replace Chinese characters. He said that it should be admitted that Chinese characters are difficult to learn. Now, on the one hand, the strokes of Chinese characters are simplified, and on the other hand, phonetic symbols are added, with the aim of improving Chinese characters and making them easy for the broad masses to master. He said that the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme can also be used to spell Mandarin Chinese, as an effective tool for teaching Mandarin Chinese, can serve as a common foundation for the creation and reform of writing systems by various ethnic minorities, and can help foreigners learn Chinese to promote international cultural exchange.

Chairman Zhou Enlai said that the currently published draft of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme has been developed on the basis of various Latin alphabet-based schemes in the past. Its historical origin can be traced back to more than 350 years ago, and in recent times, it can be said to be a summary of the experience of our people in creating Chinese phonetic alphabet schemes for 60 years. This scheme is indeed more complete than the various Latin alphabet phonetic schemes that existed in history and are still in use today. When he talked about the issue of whether the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme adopts Latin letters, which may conflict with the patriotic feelings of our people, he said that there are now more than 60 countries in the world that use Latin letters as symbols for writing languages. After accepting Latin letters, they have made necessary adjustments or processing to adapt them to the needs of their own national languages, so they have all become their own national letters. On the other hand, Latin letters can also be said not to be letters exclusive to any one country, but internationally used symbols. After we have adopted Latin letters and adjusted them to adapt to the needs of Chinese, they have become our own Chinese phonetic letters. Using them to serve us will not cause any damage to our patriotic feelings.

Chairman Zhou Enlai finally talked about the future of Chinese characters that everyone is concerned about. He said that Chinese characters have made indelible contributions in history. As for whether Chinese characters will remain unchanged forever or be replaced by phonetic scripts, it is not yet time to draw a conclusion. Everyone has different opinions and can argue about them. But writing is always changing, as evidenced by the past changes in Chinese characters.

Chairman Zhou Enlai pointed out that language reform is a major event related to the people of the whole country, and the government has taken very cautious steps in this regard. He asked everyone to work hard to do this work well. If there are shortcomings in the work, they can be improved. He hoped that everyone would publicize and eliminate various misunderstandings about language reform and actively support the work of language reform.

Hu Qiaomu, a member of the Chinese Language Reform Committee, gave a systematic explanation of the draft Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme after Chairman Zhou Enlai's report.

    大家努力来做好文字改革工作
    周恩来在政协报告会上谈当前文字改革任务
    新华社10日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会10日上午在政协礼堂举行报告会，由政协全国委员会周恩来主席作了“当前文字改革的任务”的报告。出席今天报告会的有全国人民代表大会在京代表，政协全国委员会在京委员，各民主党派、人民团体的负责人，政府各部门高级知识分子，北京各大专学校的教授、讲师，中央文史馆馆员，以及文艺界人士，报社、出版社、杂志社负责人等近三千人。
    周恩来主席在报告中指出当前文字改革的三个任务是：简化汉字，推广普通话，制定和推行汉语拼音方案。他说，自从“汉字简化方案”在1956年1月由国务院公布以来，简字已经在报纸、刊物、课本和一般书籍上被普遍采用，受到广大群众的欢迎，大家称便。我们站在广大人民的立场上，应该把汉字简化这项工作肯定下来。他指出，汉字简化工作所采取的方针“约定俗成，稳步前进”是正确的，但是在具体工作中还有考虑得不周到的地方，少数简字在应用上还不够妥善，以后可以作必要的修改。目前社会上使用简字还存在一些混乱现象，应该加以适当控制。特别在印刷物上，必须防止滥用简字。但是，他说，从汉字的历史上来看，一字多体从甲骨文起就一直存在。今天广大群众正在开始掌握文字，并且迫切要求改革文字，这是历史上任何一个朝代所没有的，“汉字简化方案”的制定，目的正在于把混乱引导到一个统一的规范。他指出，汉字简化不会妨碍对于书法的爱好。书法是一种艺术，当然可以不受汉字简化的限制。
    周恩来主席说，汉语简化的第二个任务是推广普通话。我国汉民族的语言存在着很严重的方言分歧，主要是在语音方面。这种方言的分歧，对于我国人民的政治、经济、文化生活都带来了不利的影响。因此，在我国近六亿的汉族人民中大力推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话就是一项重要的政治任务。自从1955年10月全国文字改革会议以来，推广普通话收到了一定的效果。现在全国中小学语文教师中已经有七十多万人受过普通话的语音训练。全国中小学校中有很大一部分已经开始用普通话进行教学。全国收听中央人民广播电台举办的普通话语音教学广播讲座的在二百万人以上。他指出，推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话，并非要求全体汉族人民都能说得像北京人一样，这样既不可能，也是不必要的。北京语音是个标准，有个标准就有了个方向。在具体推广和教学工作中，对不同对象应有不同的要求。首先应该在学校里，在儿童和青年中大力推广。他说，推广普通话不是要禁止或者消灭方言。方言是会长期存在的，不能用行政命令来禁止，也不能用人为的办法来消灭。我们推广普通话，是为了消除方言之间的隔阂。他指出，要把汉族人民的方言统一起来，这是一项艰巨的任务，必须作长期不懈的努力。
    周恩来主席在讲到第三个任务关于制定和推广汉语拼音方案时指出：汉语拼音方案是用来为汉字注音和推广普通话的，它并不是用来代替汉字的拼音文字。他说，应该承认汉字是难学的，现在一方面简化汉字的笔画，另方面注上拼音，目的在改进汉字，让它容易为广大群众掌握。他说，汉语拼音方案还可以用来拼写普通话，作为教学普通话的有效工具，可以作为各少数民族创造和改革文字的共同基础，可以帮助外国人学习汉语，以促进国际文化交流。
    周恩来主席说，现在公布的汉语拼音方案草案，是在过去的各种拉丁字母式的方案的基础上发展出来的。它的历史渊源远则可以一直推溯到三百五十多年以前，近则可以说是总结了六十年来我国人民创制汉语拼音方案的经验。这个方案，比起历史上存在过的以及目前还在沿用的各种拉丁字母的拼音方案来，确实更加完善。他在讲到汉语拼音方案采用了拉丁字母，是不是会跟我国人民的爱国感情相抵触问题时说，现在世界上有六十多个国家采用拉丁字母来作为书写语言的符号，它们接受拉丁字母以后，都对它作了必要的调整或者加工，使它适应本民族语言的需要，因此都已经成为各个民族自己的字母了，另一方面。拉丁字母也因此可以说不是哪一个国家专有的字母，而是国际公用的符号。我们采用了拉丁字母，经过我们的调整使它适应了汉语需要之后，它已经成为我们自己的汉语拼音字母了。用它来为我们服务，是不会使我们的爱国感情受到任何损害的。
    周恩来主席最后谈到大家关心的汉字前途问题。他说，汉字在历史上有过不可磨灭的功绩，至于汉字是不是千秋万岁永远不变，还是要被拼音文字代替，现在还不忙作出结论。大家有不同的意见，可以争鸣。但是文字总是要变化的，拿汉字过去的变化就可以证明。
    周恩来主席指出，文字改革是关系到全国人民的一件大事，政府对它采取的是很慎重的步骤。他要求大家一起来努力做好这项工作。工作中如果有缺点，可以改进。他希望大家来做宣传，消除对文字改革的各种误解，积极支持文字改革工作。
    中国文字改革委员会委员胡乔木在周恩来主席报告之后，对汉语拼音方案草案作了系统的说明。
