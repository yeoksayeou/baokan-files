Regarding the Controversy over "Rice Bran Oil Extraction"
    Zhang Ziyi, Institute of Animal Husbandry, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences

    Editor's Note: On September 24th of last year, this newspaper published an article by Comrade Zhou Shangda entitled "Promote Rice Bran Oil Extraction." On November 11th, we published an article by Comrade Li Shude entitled "Rice Bran Oil Extraction Should Not Be Promoted." Since then, we have received more than ten articles on this issue, with conflicting opinions. Most comrades agree with Comrade Zhou Shangda's opinion, believing that promoting rice bran oil extraction can alleviate the contradiction between supply and demand in the context of tight edible oil supplies, while having little or no impact on the development of the pig-raising industry. Currently, China produces approximately five million tons of rice bran annually. Whether or not to utilize this for oil extraction is closely related to the people's livelihood. To clarify this issue, we have asked Comrade Zhang Ziyi of the Institute of Animal Husbandry, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, to write this article, which is now published here. Readers in various regions are welcome to raise different opinions for further study.

    On September 24th of last year, the People's Daily published Comrade Zhou Shangda's views on "Promoting Rice Bran Oil Extraction." On November 11th, Comrade Li Shude raised objections in the "Letters from the Masses" column. I basically agree with Comrade Zhou Shangda's points: rice bran can increase oil production after oil extraction, and reduce spoilage during storage. However, the nutritional data regarding pigs cited by Comrade Zhou Shangda, as well as the evaluation of the nutritional value of rice bran and defatted rice bran, need further research. To clarify the focus of this debate, I would like to briefly introduce the opinions of both sides:

    The reasons for advocating rice bran oil extraction are: rice bran has a high oil content, but it is not the nutrition needed by pigs. If used for oil extraction, it can not only solve the current shortage of oil for the soap industry, but also prevent rice bran from spoiling. The reasons against advocating rice bran oil extraction are: currently, China is vigorously developing pig raising, but there is a shortage of pig feed. In many areas, rice bran is one of the main feeds for pigs, and pigs also need oil. If rice bran oil extraction is promoted, it will not only reduce the quantity of pig feed, but also reduce the quality. This will inevitably affect pig raising and manure accumulation, which will further affect grain production.

    For the sake of discussion, I would like to discuss the issue from three aspects: whether pigs need oil, rice bran preservation conditions, and rational utilization of rice bran.

    From the perspective of animal husbandry, is oil necessary in pig feed? This depends on the composition of the feed that pigs eat daily and the quality of the feed. If the feed conditions are good, there is no need for a large amount of fat in the feed, because the animal's body fat can be transformed from carbohydrates and proteins. If the feed conditions are poor, it is a different matter. Because after the fat is eaten by the pig, it will be decomposed into glycerol and fatty acids after entering the intestinal tract, part of which will be further decomposed to form heat energy, which directly maintains the animal's heat metabolism balance; and the other part will re-synthesize fat molecules in the intestinal mucosal epithelium, and these fats will be stored in the liver or subcutaneous tissue in different ways to become a heat storage warehouse. If the feed quality is poor or the feeding amount is insufficient, these fats will be decomposed and oxidized into carbonic acid and water with the participation of enzymes, while releasing a large amount of heat to maintain the animal's normal physiology. Therefore, in the latter case, the fat in rice bran has a different meaning in pig feed. On this point, Comrade Zhou Shangda's explanation of the formation of animal body fat by opposing fat to starch and protein, and his emphasis that the key to China's current pig-raising technology is not a lack of fat but a lack of starch and protein, is not appropriate. In particular, Comrade Zhou Shangda cited two examples from the North China Institute of Agricultural Sciences and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, which are far apart. Without considering the time, location, pig breed, and daily feed composition, he came to the conclusion that "fat growth is not because of eating more oil," which is easy to cause many disputes other than the rice bran oil extraction issue.

    We believe that it should be acknowledged realistically that the feed value of fresh rice bran is reduced after oil extraction. In addition to a decrease of about one-half in oil content, vitamins B and tocopherol will also be reduced by one-third to one-half, which can be understood from common sense. In 1954, in order to clarify the difference in feed value between rice bran and defatted rice bran cake, we conducted a comparative pig feeding experiment with twenty fattening pigs using rice bran and bran cake. The experimental results clearly pointed out that the average daily weight gain of pigs fed with fresh rice bran was 544 grams per head, while the average daily weight gain of pigs fed with the same amount of bran cake was only 425 grams per head, a difference of about 119 grams. According to the experimental data, every 100 jin of rice bran will reduce the net pork production by about 5.3 to 6.3 jin after oil extraction, calculated at an 86% cake yield. On this point, I basically agree with Comrade Li Shude's view that "pigs do not waste the fat in rice bran."

    However, rice bran contains about 20% fat, and also contains a considerable amount of fat-decomposing enzyme—lipase. According to research by Indian and Japanese scholars, due to the activity of lipase, the free fatty acids in the oil of fresh rice bran increase rapidly from about 3% to 60%-70% within a month, and the acid value of the fat in rice bran also increases significantly and rapidly. Therefore, the deterioration problem of rice bran during preservation should become a major issue. Especially in China, rice bran is mainly produced in the south, and the temperature and humidity are high in the south. Often due to improper handling, it will cause a large amount of heat and spoilage, or at least a bitter taste. When the feeding method is improper, it will often cause diseases such as dysentery and diarrhea in livestock. On the other hand, the current supply of oil for the soap industry is extremely tight, and it is still necessary to supplement it from soybean oil, which can be used for edible purposes. Under such circumstances, what reason do we have to disagree with using rice bran for oil extraction? Moreover, from the perspective of the amount of rice bran that can be used for oil extraction in China, it is only 1.3 million tons near cities, which can only extract 150,000 tons of oil. In fact, the loss of quality and quantity caused invisibly each year due to improper preservation is estimated to be no less than this number. China's second five-year plan is to develop 250 million pigs. Even if rice bran oil extraction is stopped, it will not help. The feed problem needs to be solved by rationally combining agricultural production, establishing feed bases, and opening up feed sources from the vast rural areas. If the problem is discussed in this way, the dispute over whether rice bran should be used for oil extraction can be resolved.

    From the above situation, we believe that the issue of rice bran oil extraction should not be limited to the question of whether pigs need the oil in rice bran, but should be solved from the perspective of the rational and economical utilization of rice bran according to local conditions. From the perspective of the current tight supply of oil sources in the country, rice bran oil extraction should be actively promoted in areas with high temperature and humidity, large rice bran production, and difficulty in preservation; other areas should comprehensively consider the country's need for oil and the local feed production and supply conditions, and decide on this issue in the spirit of making the best use of everything. Comprehensive affirmation or comprehensive negation will make it difficult to solve the problem rationally.

    关于“米糠榨油”问题的争论
    中国农业科学院畜牧研究所　张子仪
    编者按　去年9月24日，本报发表了周上达同志写的“推广米糠榨油”一文，11月11日，又发表了李树德同志写的“不应该推广米糠榨油”。此后，我们又陆续收到有关这一问题的文章十多篇，意见也不一致，多数同志同意周上达同志的意见，认为在食油供应紧张的情况下，推广米糠榨油可以缓和供求矛盾，同时并不影响或很少影响养猪事业的发展。目前我国每年约可产米糠五百万吨，究竟要不要利用来榨油，和人民生活有着密切的关系。为了明确这一问题，我们请中国农业科学院畜牧研究所张子仪同志写了这篇文章，现在发表在这里。各地读者如有不同意见，还可以提出来研究。                                            
    去年9月24日，人民日报发表了周上达同志的“推广米糠榨油”的看法。11月11日，李树德同志在群众来信栏中提出了反对的意见。我基本上同意周上达同志所提的：米糠经过榨油后可以增产油脂，减少米糠在贮藏期间酸败变质。不过周上达同志所引证的有关猪的营养方面的资料，以及对米糠与脱脂米糠的营养价值的估价，还须要作进一步研究。为了明确这一问题的争论焦点，我想不妨把双方意见扼要地介绍一下：
    主张用米糠榨油的理由是：米糠中含油量高，但并不是猪所需要的营养。如果用来榨油，不但可以解决目前肥皂工业等用油供应不足的问题，还可以防止米糠的败坏。不主张用米糠榨油的理由是：目前我国正在大力发展养猪，而猪饲料又不足，很多地区米糠又是猪的主要饲料之一，同时猪也需要油脂，如果推广米糠榨油以后，不但会减少猪饲料的数量，同时也会降低质量。这样势必会影响养猪积肥，进一步还会影响到粮食增产。
    为了便于讨论起见，我想从猪是否需要油脂，米糠的保存条件，及合理利用米糠的途径等三方面来谈。
    从家畜饲养学上来看，猪饲料中是否需要有油脂呢？这要看猪每日吃的饲料构成情况和饲料质量的好坏来决定。如果饲料条件良好，饲料中就不需要大量的脂肪。因为动物的体脂能由碳水化合物、蛋白质转变成。如果饲料条件较差，就又当别论了。因为被猪吃下以后的脂肪，在进入肠道后，会分解成甘油和脂肪酸，其中一部分再进一步分解形成热能，直接维持动物热量代谢平衡；而另一部分则在肠粘膜上皮中重新合成脂肪分子，这些脂肪再通过不同方式被蓄积在肝脏或皮下组织中，成为热量的贮存库。如果饲料质量差，或喂食的量不足的时候，这些脂肪会在酶的参与下分解氧化变成碳酸和水，同时放出大量的热量，维持动物的正常生理。因此，在后一种情况下，米糠中的脂肪在猪饲料中就有着不同的意义了。在这一点上，周上达同志把脂肪和淀粉、蛋白质对立起来解释动物体脂的形成，以及强调当前我国养猪技术的关键并不是脂肪不够而是淀粉、蛋白质不够，提法是不太合适的。特别是周上达同志举了华北农业科学研究所和远隔千里的上海市农业局的两个例子，不考虑试验的时间、地点、猪种、每日饲料的组成等条件，就得出了“脂肪的生长并不是因为多吃了油”的结论，容易引起米糠榨油问题以外的许多争论。
    我们认为应该实事求是的承认新鲜的米糠经榨油后，饲料价值是有所降低的，除了油脂含量降低约二分之一外，维生素乙类及生育醇等维生素亦会减少三分之一——二分之一，这一点从常识上也是可以理解的。1954年为明确米糠和脱脂米糠饼在饲料价值上的差异，我们曾用二十头肥猪进行过米糠和糠饼的对比喂猪试验。试验结果明显的指出：喂用新鲜米糠的猪平均每头每日长五百四十四克，而喂用等量糠饼的猪平均每头每日才长四百二十五克，两者相差约一百一十九克。根据试验资料计算：每一百斤米糠经榨油后以86％的出饼率计，大约会减产净猪肉五点三——六点三斤。在这一点上我基本上同意李树德同志所提出的“猪吃了米糠中的脂肪并不白费”的看法。
    但是米糠中约含有20％左右的脂肪，同时亦含着相当量的脂肪分解酵素——脂酶。据印度和日本学者的研究，由于脂酶的活动，新鲜的米糠里的油脂所含的游离脂肪酸类，在一个月以内约从3％很快的增加到60％—70％，同时米糠中脂肪的酸价亦显著迅速升高，因此米糠在保存过程中的变质问题便应该成为主要问题了。特别是我国的米糠集中生产在南方，而南方气温高，湿度大，往往由于处理不当，重则大量发热败坏，轻则味道发苦。在饲喂方法不当的时候，也往往会引起家畜发生痢疾、腹泻等病症。另一方面，目前肥皂工业用油极度紧张，还需要从可供作食用的大豆油中补足。在这种情况下，我们有什么理由不同意用米糠来榨油呢？何况，从我国目前可能供作榨油的米糠数量来看，仅为城市附近的一百三十万吨，仅可榨取油十五万吨。事实上，每年由于保存不当而在无形中引起的质与量的损耗，估计不低于此数。我国第二个五年计划发展二亿五千万头猪，纵然停止米糠榨油，也无济于事。饲料的问题需要从合理的结合农业生产、建立饲料基地、从广大农村中开辟饲料来源来解决，如果把问题这样摆开来谈，就可以解决米糠应该不应该榨油的争论了。
    从以上情况看来，我们认为关于米糠榨油问题，不应该局限在猪是否需要米糠中的油脂这个问题上，而应该因地制宜地从米糠的合理经济利用问题上来获得解决。从目前国家油料来源紧张的情况来看，在气温、湿度高，米糠产量大而保存不易的地区，应该积极推广米糠榨油；其他地区应该全面考虑国家对油脂的需要及当地饲料的生产供应条件，本着物尽其用的精神来决定这一问题。全面肯定或全面否定都是难以使问题获得合理解决的。
