    Don't Burn Cottonseed Hulls
    Oil factories and workshops extract oil from cottonseed, and the first step is to peel off the cottonseed hulls. These peeled cottonseed hulls are generally used as fuel. However, cottonseed hulls have many uses, and it is a pity to burn them as fuel. In recent years, the Nantong area of Jiangsu Province has used cottonseed hulls as winter feed for draft animals, with good results. Some places have also used it to make good pig feed.

    In addition to being used to make feed, cottonseed hulls can also be used to extract "furfural." The Tangzha Oil and Grease Factory in Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, has successfully trial-produced it and is preparing to build a workshop to manufacture "furfural." "Furfural" is an organic chemical raw material that is needed as an intermediate raw material for the manufacture of synthetic rubber, nylon, plastics, and petroleum refining. At present, only Tianjin and Chongqing produce it in small quantities domestically, and most of it still needs to be imported. If major oil factories can use cottonseed hulls to manufacture furfural, it can greatly save foreign exchange.

    不要把棉子壳烧掉
    油厂和油坊用棉子榨油，首先要把棉子壳剥下来。这些剥下来的棉子壳一般都是当作燃料用的。但是，棉子壳有很多用途，当燃料烧掉了，实在可惜。近年来，江苏南通地区把棉子壳当作冬季的耕畜饲料，效果很好。有些地方还用它制成了良好的猪饲料。
    棉子壳除可以制造饲料外，还可以提制“糠醛”。江苏南通市唐闸油脂厂已经试制成功，正在筹建制造“糠醛”的车间。“糠醛”是一种有机化工原料，制造人造橡胶、尼龙、塑胶、提炼石油都要它作中间原料。现在国内仅有天津、重庆两地小量生产，大部分还要进口。如果各大油厂都能够利用棉子壳制造糠醛，就可以大大节约外汇。
