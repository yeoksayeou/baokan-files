Title: Secret Experiment, Public Humiliation

Secret experiments, public humiliation. "Vanguard" failed repeatedly, falling headfirst once again. Although the experiment was conducted in secret, the embarrassment is inevitably public. It is said that it is not that American technology is backward, but that "minor accidents" were not addressed in time. But failure is failure after all, and embarrassment is still embarrassment. A few days ago, American officials were still boasting that American science was superior to that of the Soviet Union, (note) but so far only Soviet satellites are in the sky. The red moon continues to provide valuable data, while the American "Vanguard" continues to create laughing stocks for the world. Perhaps the Washington authorities will advise everyone not to laugh, because they had already stated in advance that "the possibility of success is very small." Then, honestly admit that you are not up to it, and stop boasting wildly about rockets that cannot leave the ground.

Note: U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Strauss said a few days ago: In his opinion, the United States "is far ahead of the Soviets in all aspects of science and technology."

    秘密试验　公开丢脸
    池北偶失败接连着失败，“先锋”又一次倒栽。试验虽秘密进行，丢脸却难免公开。据说并非美国技术落后，只是“轻微事故”未及措手。但是失败终究是失败，出丑仍然照样要出丑。前几天美国官员还在吹嘘美国科学比苏联高明，（注）然而天上到如今还只有苏联的卫星。红色的月亮不断提供珍贵的资料，美国的“先锋”却继续给世人制造笑柄。也许华盛顿当局会劝大家不要见笑，因为事先已经声明“成功的可能性很小”。那末，还是老老实实承认自己不行吧，别再抱着不能离地的火箭胡乱夸耀。
    注：美国原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯日前说：在他看来，美国“在科学技术的一切方面都远远走在苏联人前面。”
