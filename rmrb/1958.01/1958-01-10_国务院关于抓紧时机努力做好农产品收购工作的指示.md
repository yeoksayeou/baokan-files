Currently, the procurement of agricultural products nationwide has reached completion or exceeded targets for some regions and some varieties. Some regions are in the final stages, while others are far from completing their tasks. Regardless of the category, all regions must earnestly carry out the procurement of agricultural products, striving for increased purchases. Regions that have not completed their tasks should take effective measures to strive for a comprehensive completion and over-fulfillment of various agricultural product procurement tasks.

According to reports from various localities and departments, as of the first and middle ten days of December 1957, except for edible vegetable oils and flue-cured tobacco, where production decreased due to disasters, resulting in a larger decrease in procurement compared to the same period in 1956, the procurement of other agricultural products has increased to varying degrees compared to the same period in 1956. In particular, the progress of grain and cotton procurement has been much faster than in the same period in 1956, which is a significant achievement. This is the result of the in-depth development of socialist debates in rural areas nationwide, the further improvement of the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of farmers, and the hard work of state personnel.

However, there are also some pressing problems in the procurement work. The main one is that the procurement situation of agricultural products in this production year is more unbalanced in terms of regions and varieties than in previous years. This is a situation that deserves serious attention. Does this situation reflect that there are no more agricultural products to be procured in rural areas? No. Except for some local areas where agricultural products have been sold out, generally speaking, the main reason is that the agricultural products that should be procured have not been procured by us in a timely manner. The reason for this situation is that many places did not properly arrange the procurement of agricultural products while the central task in rural areas shifted to water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns. Secondly, some areas have experienced relaxation, failing to allocate the necessary resources to grasp the procurement of agricultural products. Blind optimism or fear of difficulties has grown among some cadres, which has also had some impact on the procurement of agricultural products. All regions where the above situation has occurred must reverse this trend.

The State Council believes that for all necessary and possible agricultural products to be procured, every effort should be made to procure them in full. To this end, all localities must effectively solve the following problems in the procurement of agricultural products:

First, people's committees at all levels must, under the unified leadership and deployment of the Party committees, allocate the necessary leadership and working cadres to specifically lead, grasp, and inspect the procurement of various agricultural products, and properly solve the labor force arrangement between water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns and the procurement of agricultural products, so that they can both complete the work of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation very well, and also procure the agricultural and sideline products that should be procured more.

Second, in addition to continuing to mobilize agricultural cooperatives and farmers to sell agricultural products, it is more important for purchasing departments to go deep into rural areas to visit cooperatives and households for procurement. At present, rural areas are engaged in intense water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns, and it is difficult for grassroots cadres to comprehensively take care of the procurement of agricultural products. Therefore, all localities must combine with the rural production movement, and use the gaps in production and field rest time to mobilize agricultural cooperatives and farmers to sell agricultural products to complete the state procurement tasks. At this time, all procurement agencies must correspondingly change their procurement methods, mobilize all their forces, and prepare the necessary transportation tools to go deep into rural areas to visit cooperatives and households for procurement, while also carrying goods to the countryside to support procurement. In addition, they should also help agricultural cooperatives do a good job in weighing, bookkeeping, and other economic work as much as possible.

Third, agricultural cooperatives should allocate and organize the necessary labor force to carry out the picking, peeling, and preliminary processing of agricultural products. According to reports from various localities, many agricultural cooperatives have failed to allocate and organize the necessary labor force to carry out the picking, peeling, and preliminary processing of agricultural products in a timely manner, which has also affected the completion of the state's agricultural product procurement tasks to a certain extent, and even caused great losses in the quality and quantity of agricultural products. This situation is unfavorable to both the state and the agricultural cooperatives, and must be changed quickly.

Fourth, a comprehensive review of the procurement work must be carried out, and the key varieties must be tightly grasped. Special attention should be paid to key areas where tasks have not been completed well or where there is greater procurement potential. In the review, full efforts should be made in areas where procurement tasks can be completed but have not been completed, and even in areas where tasks have been completed but there is still procurement potential, as much as possible should be procured. However, it is absolutely forbidden to purchase excessive grain from agricultural cooperatives and farmers.

Fifth, market management should continue to be strengthened to prevent and combat speculation. Since the State Council issued the "Regulations on Prohibiting Agricultural Products and Other Materials Subject to State Planned Procurement (Monopoly Purchase) and Unified Purchase from Entering the Free Market," the smooth progress of the procurement of agricultural products has been guaranteed. However, some places have recently reported that speculation still occurs. All localities must strictly prevent this phenomenon, and those that have already occurred should be given due punishment.

Sixth, while reviewing the unified grain purchase, all localities must effectively arrange the unified grain sales in rural areas. Judging from the situation reported by many regions, the biggest problem in the current rural grain work is that the unified purchase work is not combined with the unified sales work, and this is a fairly common phenomenon. Therefore, when reviewing the unified grain purchase, all localities must complete the task of arranging unified sales as a more important task. Otherwise, it will be difficult to guarantee that there will be no problems with the grain supply in the season when the old crop is running out and the new crop is not yet harvested. This issue is particularly important.

Seventh, the progress of unified purchase of some varieties of edible vegetable oils this year has been very slow. The reasons for this are not only reduced production due to disasters, but also shortcomings in the work. As of mid-December, the national purchase of edible oil (including oilseeds converted to oil) only completed 45.09% of the task, a decrease of 15.32% compared to the same period in 1956. It is particularly noteworthy that since December 1957, the progress of unified purchase has shown a downward trend every ten days. Therefore, efforts must be made to ensure that tasks are over-fulfilled in abundant production areas, and a more positive attitude should be taken to strive for more purchases in areas with reduced production.

Based on the production and procurement situation, this year's cotton procurement task should be appropriately increased, and the specific targets will be issued separately by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.

After receiving this instruction, all localities should immediately conduct a special inspection and deployment, and submit a special report on the inspection and deployment to the State Council.

### 国务院关于抓紧时机努力做好农产品收购工作的指示

    国务院关于抓紧时机努力做好农产品收购工作的指示
    目前全国的农产品收购工作，有些地区有些品种已经完成或者超额完成任务，有些地区已经进入扫尾阶段，有些地区离完成任务还远。无论那一类地区都必须切实做好农产品收购工作，争取多购。没有完成任务的地区，更应采取有效措施，争取全面地完成和超额完成各种农产品收购任务。
    根据各地和各部门的报告，截至1957年12月上、中旬，除了食用植物油脂、烤烟等因为受灾减产而使收购量比1956年同期减少较多以外，其他农产品的收购量都比1956年同期有不同程度的增加，特别是粮食、棉花的收购进度比1956年同期要快得多，成绩是很显著的。这是全国农村深入开展社会主义大辩论，广大农民社会主义觉悟进一步提高和国家工作人员辛勤工作的结果。
    但是，收购工作上也存在着一些急待解决的问题。主要是这一生产年度农产品收购的情况在地区和品种上比往年更不平衡。这是一个值得严重注意的情况。这种情况是不是反映农村已经没有农产品可以收购了呢？不是的。除了局部地区农产品已经出售完毕以外，整个地说来，主要还是应当收购的农产品还没有为我们及时地收购起来。产生这种情况的原因是：不少地方在农村中心工作转入兴修水利运动和积肥运动中，没有把农产品收购工作同时加以妥善安排。其次，有些地区发生了松劲现象，没有拿出必要的力量来掌握农产品的收购工作，在一些干部中间滋长了盲目乐观情绪或者畏难情绪，这对于农产品收购工作也有一定影响。凡是发生上述情况的地区，必须扭转这种情况。
    国务院认为，对于一切必需收购而又可能收购的农产品，应该想尽办法如数地收购起来。为此，各地对于农产品收购工作要切实解决以下几个问题：
    第一、各级人民委员会必须在党委统一领导和部署下，调配必要的领导力量和工作干部，专门领导、掌握和检查各种农产品的收购工作，并且妥善地解决兴修水利运动和积肥运动同农产品收购工作之间的劳动力安排问题，既要能够很好地完成兴修水利和积肥的工作，又要能够将应多收购的农副产品很好地收购起来。
    第二、除了继续动员农业社和农民出售农产品以外，更重要的是采购部门要深入农村登社登门收购。目前农村正在投入紧张的兴修水利运动和积肥运动，基层干部很难全面照顾农产品收购工作。因此，各地必须结合农村生产运动，利用生产间隙和田间休息的时间，动员农业社和农民出售农产品以完成国家收购任务。一切采购机构，这时候必须相应地改变收购方式，动员全部力量并且准备必要的运输工具深入农村登社登门收购，同时背货下乡支持收购。此外，还应该尽可能地帮助农业社做好过秤记账和其他经济工作。
    第三、要求农业社应该调配和组织必要的劳动力，进行农产品的采摘、剥制和初步加工。根据各地反映，许多农业社由于没有及时调配和组织必要的劳动力进行农产品的采摘、剥制和初步加工，也在一定程度上影响国家农产品收购任务的完成，甚至使农产品在质量上和数量上受到很大损失，这种情况不管是对国家还是对农业社都很不利，必须迅速加以改变。
    第四、必须对收购工作进行一次全面复查，并且紧紧抓住重点品种，对那些任务完成得不好或者收购潜力较大的重点地区特别抓紧。在复查中，对收购任务可能完成而又没有完成的地区固然要全力以赴，就是对那些任务已经完成但还有收购潜力的地区，也应该尽量多收购一些。但是，决不允许向农业社和农民购买过头粮。
    第五、继续加强市场管理，防止和打击投机现象。自从国务院发布“关于由国家计划收购（统购）和统一收购的农产品和其他物资不准进入自由市场的规定”以来，保证了农产品收购工作的顺利进行。但是，最近某些地方反映投机现象仍有发生，各地对于这种现象要严加防止，已经发生这种现象的应该给予应有的打击。
    第六、各地必须在复查粮食统购的同时，切实安排农村粮食统销工作。从许多地区反映的情况看：目前农村粮食工作上一个最大的问题是：统购工作没有同统销工作结合进行，而且这是一个相当普遍的现象。因此，各地在复查粮食统购的时候，必须把安排统销工作当作一个更为重大的任务来完成。否则，就很难保证今年青黄不接季节的粮食供应不发生问题。这个问题特别重要。
    第七、今年食用植物油脂，有些品种的统购进度非常迟缓，其原因除因灾减产外，工作上存在着缺点，也有很大关系。截止12月中旬，全国购进食油（包括油料折油）只完成任务的45.09％，比1956年同期减少15.32％。特别值得注意的是：从1957年12月份起，统购进度已出现逐旬下降的现象。因此，必须争取在丰产地区保证超额完成任务，减产地区更应以积极的态度，争取多收。
    根据生产和收购情况，本年度棉花收购任务，应该适当提高，具体指标由全国供销合作总社另行下达。
    各地接到这个指示以后，应该立即进行一次专门的检查和布置，并且将检查和布置的情况专题报告国务院。
                                  国务院
                                        1958年1月8日
