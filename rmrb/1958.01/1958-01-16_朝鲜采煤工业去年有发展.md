Brotherly countries' construction

    The year 1957 was the year of the fastest development of the coal industry in Korea since its liberation. In that year, Korea's coal production increased by 25% compared to 1956, and exceeded the 1949 output by 21%, thus enabling this industrial sector, which had suffered very serious damage during the Korean War, to exceed its pre-war level of production. Now, with the exception of coking coal, Korea is self-sufficient in coal for industrial and residential use, and has already begun exporting some anthracite in 1956. Many coal mines are equipped with combined mining machines, winches, electric locomotives, belt conveyors and other equipment. Last year alone, the coal mines added 100 chain conveyors, laid more than ten kilometers of underground electric locomotive tracks, and added more than ten electric locomotives.
    Youths from Pyongyang and other places who volunteered to participate in the construction of coal mines began construction work on the Fengnan Coal Mine, which has an annual output of 500,000 tons of anthracite, on July 1st last year. This coal mine will be put into production in 1961.

    朝鲜采煤工业去年有发展
    1957年是朝鲜解放以来煤炭工业发展最快的一年。这一年，朝鲜煤的产量比1956年增加了25％。并且超过了1949年产量的21％，从而使这个在朝鲜战争中受到非常严重破坏的工业部门的产量超过了战前水平。现在，除了炼焦用煤以外，朝鲜工业和居民用煤都已经能够自给，并且已经在1956年开始出口一部分无烟煤。许多煤矿都装备了联合采煤机、卷扬机、电车、皮带运煤机等设备。仅去年各煤矿就新添了一百台链式运煤机，新铺设了十几公里长的井内电车轨道，增加了十几辆电车。
    平壤等地志愿参加建设煤矿的青年从去年7月1日开始进行年产五十万吨无烟煤的丰南煤矿的建设工作。这座煤矿将在1961年投入生产。
