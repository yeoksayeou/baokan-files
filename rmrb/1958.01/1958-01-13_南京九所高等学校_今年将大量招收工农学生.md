Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 11th: Nine universities in Nanjing recently reviewed the progress of their work in training worker-peasant students, affirmed successful experiences, and plan to enrol large numbers of worker-peasant students this year.

These nine universities, after a comprehensive review of the academic performance of worker-peasant students on campus, believe that before 1955, due to the leadership's emphasis, the work of training worker-peasant students was done relatively well. After 1955, due to the gradual relaxation of leadership, the phenomenon of insufficient assistance to worker-peasant students began to appear. Now, the Party committees and administrative departments of the schools have successively solicited the opinions of worker-peasant students on campus, paying attention to improvements in terms of learning conditions, appropriately reducing social activities and increasing study time, organizing teacher tutoring, and improving welfare, in order to ensure that worker-peasant students can study with greater peace of mind. The schools are also making early preparations for the work of enrolling large numbers of worker-peasant students in the future. Nanjing University, Nanjing Agricultural College, Nanjing Institute of Technology, and other schools, based on existing equipment and faculty conditions, have proposed to change the past practice of scattered and piecemeal enrollment in various majors. Starting from this summer vacation, worker-peasant students will be enrolled in batches in some majors. After enrollment, they will be given a period of intensive tutoring, and then they will join the regular undergraduate classes for learning. Nanjing Institute of Technology, Nanjing Agricultural College, Nanjing Forestry College, and East China Institute of Water Conservancy also plan to establish special classes to specifically enrol a group of veteran cadres at or above the intermediate level to study at the schools, training them to become red leadership backbones who are proficient in their fields. The worker-peasant accelerated middle schools originally attached to Nanjing University, Nanjing Institute of Technology, and other schools, which were once suspended or stopped enrolling students, are now preparing to be restored. Other universities have also proposed to establish attached worker-peasant middle schools. The night university run by Nanjing Institute of Technology and the correspondence courses run by Nanjing Agricultural College and other schools are being rectified, and it has been decided to further enrol on-the-job worker-peasant cadres to study in their spare time.

The nine universities in Nanjing currently have 7,326 worker-peasant students, an increase of more than 21 times compared to 1952, accounting for 31.32% of the total number of students. At Nanjing Agricultural College and Nanjing Aeronautical Institute, worker-peasant students account for about 40% of the total number of students. Worker-peasant students have certain difficulties when they first enter school, and the Party committees and teaching administrative departments of the schools have given them care and assistance in life and learning.

In recent years, the vast majority of these worker-peasant students have persisted in their studies in universities. Of those who enrolled after 1952 and have successively graduated and taken up jobs, Nanjing University and Nanjing Institute of Technology alone have 287 people.

    南京九所高等学校
    今年将大量招收工农学生
    据新华社南京11日电　南京九所高等学校最近检查了培养工农学生工作的情况，肯定了成功经验，计划在今年大量招收工农学生。
    这九所高等学校经过全面检查工农学生的在校学习情况，认为1955年前由于领导重视，培养工农学生的工作做得比较好。1955年以后，由于逐渐放松领导，开始出现了对工农学生帮助不够的现象。现在各校党委会、学校行政部门都陆续征求在校工农学生的意见，注意从学习条件、适当减少社会活动增加学习时间、组织教师辅导、生活福利等各方面加以改进，以保证工农学生能够更好地安心学习。各校对于今后大量招收工农学生的工作，也在提早进行准备。南京大学、南京农学院、南京工学院等校，根据现有设备和师资等条件，提出要改变过去各专业分散零星招生的办法，从今年暑假起，在一些专业成批地招收工农学生，入学后加以一个时期的集中辅导，然后归本科随班学习。南京工学院、南京农学院、南京林学院、华东水利学院等校还计划成立特别班，专门招收一批中级以上的老干部到校学习，培养成为通晓业务的红色领导骨干。南京大学、南京工学院等校原来附设的工农速成中学曾一度停办或停止招生，现在也准备恢复。其它高等学校有的也提出要附设工农中学。南京工学院所办的夜大学、南京农学院等校所办的函授班都在整顿，决定进一步招收在职的工农干部利用业余时间进修。
    南京九所高等学校现有工农学生七千三百二十六人，比1952年增加二十一倍多，占在校学生总数31.32％。南京农学院、南京航空学院工农学生都达学生总数40％左右。工农学生初入学时都有一定困难，各校党委会和教学行政部门都曾经在生活和学习上给予关怀帮助。
    几年来，这些工农学生在高等学校中绝大部分人都坚持学习，1952年以后入学陆续毕业走上工作岗位的，仅南京大学和南京工学院两个学校就有二百八十七人。
