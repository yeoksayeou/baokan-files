    Ode to Heroes (and Another Poem)
  　Sha Ou
    Here are continuous cliffs and valleys,
    Where many a hero has bent his back.
    Before natural barriers, see the heroes,
    Even ascending to the heavens, they can build a road!
    The savage mountains and rivers wanted to sweep away the Baoji-Chengdu Railway,
    They forced the torrents to obediently change course.
    A major landslide wanted to crush the Baoji-Chengdu Railway,
    They chipped away at the weathered mountain peaks!
    I Want to Go Back
    I want to go back,
    Back to my village.
    The train carries me,
    Over the Qinling Mountains, through the heart of the Daba Mountains.
    Seeing peaks holding up the blue sky as they run,
    The Jialing River drifting with green ripples.
    I will tell the people in the village,
    Visiting Chairman Mao is now very convenient.

### 英雄颂（外一首）

    英雄颂（外一首）
  　沙鸥
    这里是绵延的悬岩与峡谷，
    多少好汉在这里折腰。
    天险面前看英雄，
    上青天也能修出路一条！
    野蛮的山水要掀走宝成路，
    他们逼着洪流乖乖改道。
    大塌方要压碎宝成路，
    他们就把风化的山头削掉！
    我想回去
    我想回去，
    回到我的村庄。
    列车载着我，
    翻秦岭，穿过大巴山心脏。
    见峰峦托住蓝天奔跑，
    嘉陵江飘着绿色的细浪。
    我将告诉村里的人们，
    看望毛主席已十分便当。
