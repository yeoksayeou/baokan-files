Notes

    Who Does America Help?
    Lamine Debaghine, one of the leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front, said at a press conference in Cairo on the 17th: Algerians once hoped that the United States would help them get rid of the shackles of imperialism. But the facts prove that the United States is helping France, and therefore indirectly participating in the massacre of Algerians. Moreover, the United States is clearly aware of this.
    It should be said that Debaghine is only half right. The United States did indirectly participate in the massacre of Algerians. But on the other hand, what the United States is really helping is not France, but itself.

    美国帮助谁
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领导人之一拉明·德巴京17日在开罗举行的一次记者招待会上说：阿尔及利亚人曾经希望美国会帮助他们摆脱帝国主义的枷锁。但是事实证明美国帮助的是法国，因此间接参加了对阿尔及利亚人的屠杀。而且美国是明明知道这一点的。
    应该说，德巴京只讲对了一半。美国确实间接参加了对阿尔及利亚人的屠杀。但是另一方面，美国真正帮助的并不是法国，而是它自己。
