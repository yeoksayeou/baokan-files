Xinhua News Agency, January 26th - Ankara News: Turkish Prime Minister Menderes issued a statement on the evening of the 25th regarding his sudden visit to Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.

Although sources revealed that his "lightning visit" was due to disagreements with Iraq, he made no mention of this in his statement. The statement said that he went to Baghdad to discuss the various situations concerning the "security and peace" of the Baghdad Pact region and the "possibility of strengthening the Baghdad Pact" before the Baghdad Pact Council's Ankara meeting. According to the statement, he reached "complete agreement" with Iraq during the talks.

Menderes went to Baghdad on the evening of the 24th. After meeting with Iraqi Crown Prince Ira and Prime Minister Mirjan, he returned to Ankara on the 25th.

Menderes' sudden trip to Baghdad as the Prime Minister of the host country and the Chairman of the meeting, just as the Baghdad Pact Council was about to hold a meeting in Ankara on the 27th, was considered to be due to "some difficulties that may have occurred involving Iraq's relationship with the Baghdad Pact."

According to a report by a reporter from the Indian Press Trust: The recent statement made by Iraqi Prime Minister Mirjan in the parliament "shocked" Turkey. In his statement, Mirjan said that according to the Baghdad Pact, Iraq has not undertaken any obligation to allow the establishment of nuclear weapons or rocket bases on its territory. Well-informed sources in Ankara said that Menderes' visit was to eliminate the differences.

Regarding this matter, Turkish newspapers also mentioned that some people in the Iraqi parliament had expressed opposition to the Baghdad Pact. The newspapers pointed out that the movement within Iraq to strive for closer ties with the Arab League has been intensifying recently.

After returning to Ankara, Menderes held another secret meeting on the evening of the 25th with Nuri al-Said, the former Iraqi Prime Minister, who will attend the Baghdad Pact meeting. The content of the meeting was not disclosed. According to an Associated Press report, Said was recently rejected by the United States in his attempt to garner support for his method of solving the Palestinian problem. Said, who has close ties with Britain, requested a solution based on Israel retreating to the boundaries passed by the United Nations in 1947.

Xinhua News Agency, January 26th - Tehran News: After two days of intense activities in Tehran, the capital of Iran, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles left Tehran by special plane this morning to go to Ankara to attend the Baghdad Pact Council meeting to be held on the 27th.

On the 25th, Dulles held talks with Iranian King Pahlavi, Prime Minister Eghbal, Foreign Minister Ardalan, and others. It was revealed that the content of their talks included Iran's request for the United States to increase military and economic aid.

On this day, Dulles also had a short conversation with Pakistani Prime Minister Noon in the office of Iranian Prime Minister Eghbal. Noon passed through Tehran on his way to Ankara to attend the meeting.

Iranian Prime Minister Eghbal and Pakistani Prime Minister Noon also left Tehran by plane today to go to Ankara.

    伊拉克不做美国火箭基地
    土总理急奔巴格达当说客
    杜勒斯在伊朗紧张活动后到达安卡拉
    新华社26日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其总理曼德列斯25日晚间就他突然前往伊拉克首都巴格达所作的访问，发表了一项声明。
    虽然消息透露，他的这次“闪电访问”是由于同伊拉克之间的分歧，但是，他在声明中绝口不谈这一点。声明说，他前往巴格达，是为了在巴格达条约理事会安卡拉会议以前，讨论有关条约地区“安全与和平”的种种情况以及“加强巴格达条约的可能性”。据声明说，会谈中，他同伊拉克“达成了完全的协议”。
    曼德列斯是在24日晚间前往巴格达的。他同伊拉克王储伊拉和首相米尔詹会谈后，在25日回到安卡拉。
    当巴格达条约理事会即将于27日在安卡拉举行会议的时候，曼德列斯作为会议东道国的总理以及会议的主席突然前往巴格达，被认为是由于“可能发生了某种涉及伊拉克同巴格达条约的关系的困难”。
    据印度报业托辣斯特派记者报道：伊拉克首相米尔詹最近在议会中发表的声明使土耳其感到“震惊”，米尔詹在声明中说，根据巴格达条约，伊拉克没有承担任何义务容许在本国领土上建立核武器或火箭基地。安卡拉的消息灵通人士说，曼德列斯的访问就是为了消除分歧。
    关于这方面，土耳其报纸还提到，在伊拉克议会中曾有人表示反对巴格达条约。报纸指出，最近伊拉克国内争取同阿拉伯联盟恢复更加密切的联系的运动日益加强。
    曼德列斯回到安卡拉后，25日晚间又同将出席巴格达条约会议的伊拉克前首相努里·赛义德进行了秘密会谈。会谈内容没有透露。据美联社消息说，赛义德最近在试图为他的解决巴勒斯坦问题的方法争取支持时，遭到了美国的拒绝。同英国关系密切的赛义德要求在使以色列退到1947年联合国所通过的边界的基础上求得一个解决办法。
    新华社26日讯　德黑兰消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在伊朗首都德黑兰进行了两天紧张活动以后，今天上午乘专机离开德黑兰去安卡拉参加将在27日举行的巴格达条约理事会会议。
    杜勒斯25日分别同伊朗国王巴列维、首相埃格巴尔、外交大臣阿达兰等举行了会谈。据透露，他们会谈的内容包括伊朗要求美国增加军事和经济援助问题。
    杜勒斯这一天还在伊朗首相埃格巴尔的办公室内，同巴基斯坦总理努恩进行了短时间的谈话，努恩在去安卡拉出席会议途中经过德黑兰。
    伊朗首相埃格巴尔和巴基斯坦总理努恩也在今天乘飞机离开德黑兰去安卡拉。
