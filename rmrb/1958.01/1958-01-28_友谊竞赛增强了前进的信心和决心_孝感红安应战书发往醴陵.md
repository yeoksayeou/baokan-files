Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 27th. Xiaogan and Hong'an counties in Hubei Province have decided to accept the challenge from Liling County, Hunan Province, to conduct a thousand-jin yield competition. The challenge letters from these two counties have been sent to Liling. The challenge letters stated that Liling County's friendly challenge is a great encouragement to the people of the two counties, and further strengthens the confidence and determination of the people of the two counties to continue to realize a great leap forward in agricultural production.

According to the conditions proposed in the challenge letters, Xiaogan County requires that this year's grain yield increase from last year's 1,000 jin per mu to more than 1,200 jin per mu, of which 70,000 mu will reach 2,000 jin per mu; the yield of ginned cotton and oil crops will reach 120 jin and 400 jin per mu respectively, more than double the yield of last year. Hong'an County requires the total grain output to increase by more than 29% compared with last year, reaching an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu; the total output of oil crops will increase by more than 75% compared with last year, of which peanuts are guaranteed to produce 850 jin to 1,000 jin per mu; cotton will increase by 100% compared with last year, with an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In addition, these two counties also put forward indicators for developing pig, cattle, and fish farming, as well as afforestation and cultivation.

In the challenge letters, the two counties also proposed to carry out a nationwide patriotic health campaign. In addition to ensuring that every household has a toilet, cows have sheds, pigs have sties, every team has a manure cellar, and fertilizer ponds are in the fields, Xiaogan County has also decided to become a "four-without" county within three years, and Hong'an County has decided to become a "four-without" county within five years. ["four-without" usually refers to no rats, no flies, no mosquitoes and no bedbugs]

In the measures to ensure the comprehensive realization of the challenge conditions, both counties proposed to vigorously develop water conservancy, vigorously accumulate fertilizer, improve soil, and reform cultivation techniques. In terms of large-scale water conservancy construction, both counties strive to basically eliminate drought this year and realize gravity irrigation for 60% to 70% of the fields; in terms of fertilizer, they plan to increase the amount of fertilizer applied by more than 100% compared with last year; in terms of reforming cultivation techniques, they will achieve "improved varieties" and "dense planting" this year, and vigorously expand the area of multiple cropping; in terms of soil improvement, Xiaogan County proposed to improve 100,000 mu, and Hong'an County proposed to improve 75,000 mu.

In order to ensure the comprehensive realization of the challenge conditions, Xiaogan and Hong'an counties have put forward many specific measures to strengthen the leadership of rural work. Both counties have decided to implement classified management, layered responsibility, and contracted areas under the unified leadership of the Party committee, and continue to develop the experience of cadres planting experimental fields, so as to achieve "everything is managed by someone, everything has a model," and "every area is responsible by someone, and every level is contracted." Hong'an County's slogan is: "Cadres cultivate experimental fields, the masses cultivate bumper fields, everything has experiments, everything must be innovated, production leaps forward, and achieve double thousand jin (1,000 jin of grain and 1,000 jin of peanuts)." Xiaogan County's slogan is: "You (referring to Liling) catch up, we strive forward, you run fast, we fly further."

    新华社武汉27日电　湖北省孝感、红安两县决定接受湖南省醴陵县开展千斤丰产竞赛的挑战，这两个县的应战书已先后发往醴陵。应战书说，醴陵县的友谊挑战对两县人民是很大的鼓舞，进一步增强了两县人民继续实现农业生产大跃进的信心和决心。
    据应战书提出的条件，孝感县今年粮食要求由去年的亩产一千斤提高到一千二百斤以上，其中有七万亩达到亩产两千斤；皮棉和油料作物的亩产量分别达到一百二十斤和四百斤，比去年增产一倍多。红安县的粮食总产量要求比去年增产29％强，达到平均亩产一千斤；油料作物总产量比去年增产75％强，其中花生保证亩产八百五十斤到一千斤；棉花比去年增产一倍，平均亩产皮棉一百斤。此外，这两个县还分别提出了发展生猪、耕牛和鱼类养殖业，以及造林、育林的指标。
    这两个县在应战书中还提出要开展全民性的爱国卫生运动。除作到户户有厕所、牛有栏、猪有圈、队队有粪窖、田头有肥壋等以外，孝感县还决定在三年内成为“四无”县，红安县决定在五年内成为“四无”县。
    这两个县保证实现应战条件的措施中，都提出了大兴水利，大搞积肥，改良土壤，以及改革耕作技术等。在大兴水利方面，两县都争取在今年内基本上消除旱灾，并且使60％到70％的田实现自流灌溉；在肥料方面，计划使施肥量比去年增加一倍以上；在改革耕作技术方面，要在今年实现“良种化”、“密植化”，并且都要大力扩大复种面积；在改良土壤方面，孝感县提出改良十万亩，红安县提出改良七万五千亩。
    为保证应战条件全面实现，孝感和红安两县对加强农村工作的领导提出了许多具体措施。两县都决定在党委的统一领导下，实行分业管理，分层负责，分片包干，并且继续发展干部种试验田的经验，以作到“样样有人管，样样有榜样”，“片片有人负责，层层有人包干”。红安县的口号是：“干部培育试验田，群众培育丰产畈，事事有试验，样样要革新，生产大跃进，实现双千斤（粮食千斤和花生千斤）。”孝感县的口号是：“你们（指醴陵）赶上来，我们拼向前，你们跑得快，我们飞更远。”
