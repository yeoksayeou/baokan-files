That Kind of "Freedom" Cannot Be Given to Them
——A Refutation of "A Petty Official in Front of the Premier's Residence"
Lin Qiao

Many of the words and deeds of the rightist Wu Zuguang, who wantonly attacked the Party and socialism, have already been refuted by many comrades. Now I would like to talk about another poisonous arrow of his: "A Petty Official in Front of the Premier's Residence" (see the supplement to the People's Daily, May 13 last year). Although this article is not long, its attack on our new society is as vicious as his other poisonous arrows. Although what he attacked was the issue of telephones and gatekeepers, its essence is also against all the rules and regulations of today's new society.

In this article, Wu Zuguang showed an attitude of looking down on everything, arrogance, and a "those who submit prosper, those who resist perish" mentality. If he wants to make a phone call, it must be "transmitted immediately upon arrival," regardless of the time or whether it is for public or private matters. He vilifies the fine customs of our new society, which respect higher-level organs and value public affairs over private affairs or prioritize public affairs before private affairs, as "being afraid of superiors." Here, he viciously and defiantly advocated the trick of "using the powerful to oppress the weak" and suggested "falsely reporting the unit name." This was not enough; he also wanted to master all telephone numbers, including those he should not know. When it was impossible to satisfy this unreasonable demand, he slandered and insisted that the Party was "rejecting people from a thousand miles away." With a turn of his pen, he directed the spearhead of his attack at the Party Central Committee.

Wu Zuguang also demanded the freedom to enter and exit organs and schools at any time. Because he was refused when he visited a friend at Yunnan University early in the morning, he vilified it as a "closed-door policy," saying it was not even as good as a prison, and vilified the gatekeepers as "recognizing cars but not people," saying that "cars also function as passes," and generally called these comrades "typical figures of those who in the old society flattered the powerful and bullied the weak." Wu Zuguang's vicious slander fully demonstrates his hatred for our new society. His purpose is to overthrow the entire system and regulations of our new society today, so that they can run amok. His method is to "start from small things and focus on big issues." The examples he talks about seem true but are not, and it is very easy for some people with poor discernment to be confused. Precisely because of this, the article is highly inflammatory, and its impact is particularly bad.

However, the article "A Petty Official in Front of the Premier's Residence" also reveals a reactionary demand for extreme absolute freedom from the bourgeois rightists. This bourgeois absolute liberalism is precisely the bourgeois restorationist ideology. Wu Zuguang is using the excuse of not being "free" to make phone calls and not being "free" to enter and exit organs and schools, these daily trivial matters, to stir up public dissatisfaction and attack today's society. This method of waving the banner of "freedom" is extremely insidious and vicious. In order to attempt to restore the bourgeois regime and oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, they have picked up the "freedom" banner that had been discarded long ago to carry out rebellion. Wu Zuguang is precisely a fierce general waving this tattered banner of "freedom," shouting and charging.

The socialist democracy and freedom we are practicing today is precisely to guarantee the freedom of the majority and restrict the freedom of the minority. People living in a socialist society must be disciplined and organized, and obey centralized management, and must never be in a state of freedom, looseness, willfulness, and unrestrained anarchy. May I ask, regardless of private or public matters, regardless of whether it is during office hours, are phone calls all "transmitted as soon as they arrive?" May I ask, can one pick up the phone and call the Party committee, and find whoever one wants? How can these organs carry out their normal work? May I ask, can one swagger into organs and schools unhindered to "visit friends?" Wouldn't this be even worse than a park? Because even a park has opening hours.

In short, Wu Zuguang and other rightists are using the cover of so-called "freedom" to disintegrate us and undermine our social order and system today. His kind of "freedom" is completely different from the freedom we are talking about. What is the freedom we are talking about? It is freedom with discipline, democracy with centralism, and a unified will with a lively and vigorous individual mood.

The absolute freedom, unrestricted freedom, and willful freedom demanded by Wu Zuguang is an extremely reactionary demand. We cannot give them that kind of "freedom." That kind of freedom has long gone with the class it depended on and will never return.

### 不能给他们那种“自由”——驳“相府门前七品官”

    不能给他们那种“自由”
    ——驳“相府门前七品官”
    林翘
    右派分子吴祖光肆意地攻击党、攻击社会主义的许多言行，已经有不少同志加以驳斥。我现在想谈一下他的另一支毒箭：“相府门前七品官”（见去年5月13日人民日报副刊）。这篇文章虽不长，但对我们新社会进行的攻击，也是同他的其他的毒箭同样恶毒，他所攻击的虽然是有关电话和门警的问题，但他的实质同样是反对今天新社会的一切规章制度。
    吴祖光在这篇文章中表现出一种目空一切、狂妄自大、顺我者生逆我者亡的思想。他要是想打电话，就得不论何时不分公私，都要“随到随传”。他把新社会的尊重上级机关和重公轻私或先公后私的优良风气，诬蔑为“怕上级”。在这里他恶毒地、挑战地提倡了什么“以大压小法”的窍门，并提倡“虚报一下字号”。这还不够，他还要掌握一切电话号码包括他所不应该知道的，当他不可能满足这种无理要求时，就血口喷人，硬说党是“拒人于千里之外”。笔锋一转，他就把攻击的矛头指向了党中央。
    吴祖光还要求有在任何时候都可随便出入机关学校的自由。由于他一清早到云南大学访友遭到拒绝，就诬蔑为“关门制度”，说连监狱都不如，诬蔑门警“认车不认人”，说什么“小汽车是兼有通行证的作用”，总称这些同志是“旧社会里趋炎附势、谄上欺下的典型人物。”吴祖光如此恶语中伤，充分表明了他对于我们新社会的仇恨，其目的就是要打倒今天我们整个新社会的制度和规章，让他们来横冲直撞；而其手法是“从小处着手，从大处着眼”。他所谈的事例似是而实非，极容易使一些辨别能力差的人受到迷惑，正因为如此，所以这篇文章的煽动性是强的，它的影响也特别来得恶劣。
    然而从“相府门前七品官”这篇文章中也透露出资产阶级右派的一种要求极端反动的绝对自由的呼声。而这种资产阶级绝对自由主义正是资产阶级复辟的思潮。吴祖光正是借口打电话不“自由”、进出机关学校不“自由”，这些日常琐事来煽起群众的不满，来攻击今天的社会。这种打着争“自由”的旗号的手法是极其阴险和毒辣的。为了企图复辟资产阶级政权，为了反对无产阶级专政，他们把早已抛在一边的“自由”旗帜又重新拾起来进行叛乱。吴祖光正是抓着这样一面破旧的“自由”的旗帜在摇旗呐喊，冲锋陷阵的悍将。
    我们今天所实行的社会主义民主和自由，正是保障多数人的自由，限制少数人的自由，生活在社会主义社会的人，都必须有纪律有组织，服从集中的管理，而绝不是处于自由散漫、随心所欲、无拘无束的无政府状态。试问不论私事公事，不问是否办公时间，打电话都是“话到即传”，试问抓起电话就可往党委打，要谁就要找到谁，这还怎么使这些机关进行正常的工作？试问机关学校都可以大摇大摆出入无阻地“访友”，这岂非连公园也不如了吗？因为公园也还有个开放时间。
    总之，吴祖光和别的右派分子在所谓争“自由”的掩护下来瓦解我们，破坏今天我们的社会秩序和制度。他的这种“自由”和我们所说的自由完全是两回事。我们所说的自由呢？是既有自由，又有纪律，既有民主、又有集中，既有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅生动活泼的自由。
    吴祖光所要求的绝对的自由，无限制的自由，随心所欲的自由，是一种极端反动的要求，我们不能给他们那种“自由”，那种自由是早已随着它所依附的阶级一去不复返了。
