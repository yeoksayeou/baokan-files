Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 9th. An Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated today that Indonesia cannot accept the proposal to reinstate the United Nations Commission for Indonesia to mediate the West Irian dispute.

The spokesperson made these remarks when commenting on Dutch Prime Minister Drees's interview with a United Press reporter on the 7th. In his interview, Drees mentioned that the United Nations Commission for Indonesia had facilitated the Round Table Conference agreement between the Netherlands and Indonesia, and he believed that "the United Nations now has a responsibility to take action" to interfere in Indonesia's anti-Dutch struggle.

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson pointed out that since the Netherlands transferred sovereignty over the former Netherlands East Indies archipelago to Indonesia in 1949, there has been no need to reinstate the United Nations Commission for Indonesia. He pointed out that interference by this commission in the dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands is unacceptable to the Indonesian people.

The member states of the United Nations Commission for Indonesia include the United States, Australia, and Belgium.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 10th. Silas Papare, a member of the Indonesian Parliament representing West Irian Province, told reporters today that he had received many letters from West Irian under Dutch occupation. In these letters, the people of West Irian expressed their full support for the measures taken by the Djuanda Cabinet to strive for the liberation of West Irian.

In another conversation, Papare said that the people of West Irian often take strike action to fight the Dutch colonialists. He estimated that Dutch control over West Irian is weak. Dutch colonialists can only govern areas near Dutch military bases.

    印度尼西亚坚持收复西伊里安
    拒绝所谓联合国调停
    西伊里安人民支持政府的解放措施
    新华社雅加达9日电　印度尼西亚外交部发言人今天表示，印度尼西亚不能接受恢复联合国印度尼西亚委员会来调停西伊里安争端的主张。
    这位发言人是在评论荷兰首相德里斯在7日对合众社记者发表的谈话时这样表示的。德里斯在他的谈话中提到联合国印度尼西亚委员会曾经促使荷兰和印度尼西亚签订了圆桌会议协定，他认为“联合国现在有责任采取行动”来干涉印度尼西亚的反荷斗争。
    印度尼西亚外交部发言人指出，自从1949年荷兰把前荷属东印度群岛的主权移交给印度尼西亚以后，就再也没有必要恢复联合国印度尼西亚委员会。他指出，由这个委员会来干涉印度尼西亚和荷兰的争端是印度尼西亚人民所不能接受的。
    联合国印度尼西亚委员会的成员国包括美国、澳大利亚和比利时。
    据新华社雅加达10日电　印度尼西亚国会的西伊里安省议员西拉斯·帕帕勒今天对报界说，他收到许多封从荷兰占领下的西伊里安寄来的信；在这些信中，西伊里安人民表示全力支持朱安达内阁所采取的争取解放西伊里安的措施。
    帕帕勒在另一次谈话中说，西伊里安人民常常采取怠工行动去向荷兰殖民主义者作斗争。他估计荷兰对西伊里安的控制是薄弱的。荷兰殖民主义者只能统治荷兰军队驻地附近的地区。
