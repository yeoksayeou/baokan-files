    A Person

    On the mud of the small courtyard in front of the house, ants were densely gathered in a black patch, slowly wriggling. It caught my attention. When I bent down to look, it turned out they were busily carrying crumbs of food in groups of three or five. Following the black stream formed by their collective direction of transport, the leading group was moving a speck of food crumb into a gap in the soil; at the same time, single ants were constantly emerging from this gap, forming a black stream in the opposite direction, intermingling with the previous one. Although I tried to observe a group or a single ant among them, I often couldn't help but doubt whether the group or single ant that I was barely able to catch with my line of sight was still the original group or single ant. And when I finally became unable to distinguish them, I realized that the center of the ant colony had moved from its original location towards the gap in the soil. The food crumbs there had all been moved away.
    My heart was stirred, and my thoughts gradually drifted away—
    If a person could stand at a high place in the world and look down upon the people working in this world, it would be like him bending down to look at the ant colony on the ground, and one of them would be indistinguishable. However, just as the ant colony seen when bending down on the ground gradually moves the food crumbs into the gaps in the soil in the blink of an eye, every person working like an ant, indistinguishable when seen from a high place in the world, is playing a role in changing the world—the face of the world is changing day by day in this entire "ant colony's" "wriggling."
    When a person can look at an individual in this way, then he will not care about any subtle or even significant gains or losses of his own; and at the same time, he will always be concerned about whether he is practically doing what he should do among the people, and fully exerting the power he can exert.

    一个人

    屋前的小院的泥地上，蚂蚁密集成黑色一摊，慢慢地蠕动着。它引起我的注意。俯身去看时，原来是三五一组地在忙碌地搬运着食物的碎屑。循着由它们共同的搬运方向所形成的黑流望去，那先头的一组正在把一星食物碎屑移进泥土的隙孔里去；而同时，单个的蚂蚁又不断地从这隙孔里出来，形成一条反方向的黑流与前一条交杂在一起。尽管我力图去观察其中的一组或单个，却不由我不常常怀疑为自己的视线所勉强捕捉住的这一组或单个，是否仍是原来的这一组或单个。而当我终于弄得无法分辨的时候，发觉蚁群中心已由原来的所在处向泥土的隙孔移动了。原来那里的食物碎屑全已搬净。
    我的心头若有所动，思想也就逐渐飞远去——
    假若一个人能站在世界的高处来俯视这世界上劳动着的人，那么将如他俯身看地上所见的蚁群一样，而其中的一个，是连分辨都分辨不清的。然而，也正如俯身看地上所见的蚁群在转眼之间把那食物碎屑逐渐搬进了泥土的隙孔一样，站世界高处所见到的像蚂蚁一样分辨不清的劳动着的每一个人，都在起着改变世界的作用——世界的面貌就在这整个“蚁群”的“蠕动”中一天天地改变着。
    当一个人能这样地来看一个人的时候，那末他对于自己的任何细微的乃至重大的得失，都会毫不在意；而同时，对于自己的在人们中间是否切实地做着自己所应做的事情、充分地尽着自己所能尽的力量，就会时刻耿耿于怀。
