Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 20th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yin Chongjing): Could there be a great leap forward? Dare to have a great leap forward? At this question, the public-private joint venture Yongli Jiuda Chemical Industrial Company's Dagukou Factory had a clash between advanced thinking and conservative thinking. In order to better resolve this ideological debate, starting on January 19th, a production leap forward review was organized. On the first day of the review, the daily production of soda ash exceeded the average daily production of the past year by 26%, creating an unprecedented record high. The workers' action of discussing plans while presenting facts gave the most vivid lesson to those with conservative ideas and cleared the way for a great leap forward.

The Yongli Jiuda Dagukou Factory is a large-scale public-private joint venture. Before the joint venture, production management was backward, and since the joint venture, production potential has not been fully realized. Veteran workers are very clear: how much potential can be unleashed from each tower, each pot, and how far can production leap forward. Therefore, after the discussion of this year's national plan began, the workers put forward advanced indicators one after another. Initially, some people proposed to increase the production of soda ash by tens of thousands of tons, which was immediately opposed by people with conservative ideas. These people stubbornly clung to conventions, saying that the factory was old, the equipment was outdated, and the load was sufficient, so production could not be increased. Some individuals even regarded the leap forward as "reckless advance." Therefore, the Party committee further mobilized the masses to use their brains more carefully to tap potential and find ways to leap forward. The masses put forward higher production increase targets one after another, but the conservative people could not keep up. When the new target of increasing production by 20,000 tons was proposed, they said, "10,000 tons is about right." When the masses proposed a target of increasing production by 30,000 tons, they said, "20,000 tons is still possible." The Party committee analyzed this situation and believed that the main reason why people's thinking was conservative was that they did not have enough understanding of the wisdom, experience, and revolutionary drive of the masses. In order to use facts to break their conservative ideas, the Party committee decided not to simply sit there and argue, but to take action. Therefore, it mobilized all Party members, League members, and trade union members one after another. The veteran workers conducted nearly a week of experiments and proved that the machinery and equipment did have potential and that there was a high degree of certainty of increased production. Finally, it was decided to start the grand review from zero o'clock on the 19th.

At exactly zero o'clock, the new shift of workers officially took up their posts. On the surface, the machines were running, the instruments were rising and falling, and the workers were operating quietly, everything was the same as usual. However, the production on this day was very different from the past. The raw materials for making soda ash—limestone and salt—were fed in more than one ton per hour; the flywheel of the new No. 4 compressor was accelerated by ten revolutions per minute; the brother workshops supplying electricity, water, and gas were constantly in contact by telephone, cooperating better than before; even the slightest problems that might affect production were not allowed to occur. The workers worked more diligently and carefully than before. There was no sign of the "reckless actions" suspected by the conservative people, and there was no increase in the intensity of physical labor.

When twelve o'clock at night on the 19th struck, the packaging workers spread the good news: in the past twenty-four hours, an unprecedented daily output record was created. Early in the morning of the 20th, the victorious workers posted a large-character poster measuring twelve feet high at the entrance of the trade union to report the good news to all the factory employees. At the same time, based on their practice, they put forward the advanced target of increasing soda ash production by 60,000 tons this year. Now, the whole factory is filled with gongs and drums, blowing and beating loudly, congratulating each other. All kinds of conservative ideas that originally existed are disappearing, everyone is talking about the leap forward, and advanced plans are being brewed everywhere.

### 永利久大沽厂组织生产跃进大检阅  生动的事实打破了保守思想

    永利久大沽厂组织生产跃进大检阅
    生动的事实打破了保守思想
    据新华社天津20日电　新华社记者尹崇敬报道：能不能大跃进？敢不敢大跃进？公私合营永利久大化学工业公司沽厂在这个问题上的先进思想同保守思想进行了交锋，为了更好地解决这场思想论争，从本月19日开始，组织了生产跃进大检阅。检阅的第一天，纯碱日产量超过去年平均日产量的26％，创造了空前未有的最高纪录。工人们的这种一面讨论计划一面拿出事实的行动，给保守的人们上了最生动的一课，也给大跃进扫清了道路。
    永利久大沽厂是一个大型的公私合营企业，合营前生产管理落后，合营以来生产潜力也远远没有发挥。老工人们很清楚：哪一座塔、哪一只锅还有多大潜力可以发挥，生产还能跃进多远。因此，讨论今年国家计划开始以后，工人们纷纷提出先进的指标。最初有人提出增产纯碱几万吨，立刻遭到思想保守的人们的反对。这些人硬守着陈规，说工厂年代久了，设备陈旧、负荷足了，不能再增产，个别人还把跃进看成是“冒进”。于是党委进一步发动群众，更细致地动脑筋挖潜力、找跃进之路，群众接二连三地提出更高的增产指标，而保守的人们步步跟不上。当增产两万吨的新指标提出以后，他们说“一万吨差不多”；群众又提出增产三万吨指标时，他们说“两万吨还可以”。党委分析了这种情况，认为思想保守的人们主要是对群众的智慧、经验和革命的干劲认识不足。为了用事实来打破他们的保守思想，党委确定不要单纯坐在那里争论，要行动起来，于是先后向全体党员、团员、工会会员作了动员。老工人们做了将近一星期的试验，证明机器设备确有潜力，增产有十分把握。最后决定，从19日零时起开始大检阅。
    零时整，新的一班工人正式走上了岗位。从表面上看去，机器转动、仪表升降、工人安静地操作，一切跟平常一样。可是这一天的生产跟往日大不相同。制造纯碱的原料——石灰石和食盐，每小时都被多投进去一吨以上；新四号压缩机的飞轮每分钟加快了十转，供电、供水、供气体的各兄弟车间不断用电话联系，比以往协作得更好；可能影响生产的一点一滴问题也不让发生。工人们比以往干得更加勤快和谨慎，看不出保守的人们所怀疑的任何“蛮干”的迹象，体力劳动的强度也看不出有什么增加。
    19日夜间十二点钟敲响的时候，包装工人们传出了喜讯，在过去的二十四小时内，一个空前的日产量最高纪录问世了。20日清早，胜利了的工人们在工会大门口贴出了一张一丈二尺高的大字报，向全厂职工报捷，同时，根据他们的实践提出了今年增产纯碱六万吨的先进指标。现在，全厂洋鼓洋号，大吹大打，相互祝贺。原来存在的各种保守思想正在烟消云散，人人都在谈跃进，到处都在酝酿先进计划。
