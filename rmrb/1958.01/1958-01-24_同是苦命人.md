    Fellow Sufferers

    A tragedy occurred in Tokyo: an unemployed teacher, driven by poverty, killed his three children and wife before committing suicide. The newspapers actually blamed this tragedy on the "weak will" of the unemployed teacher. One cannot help but ask, if his will wasn't weak, what else could he have done? The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department answered this question. Although Tokyo has the most police officers of any city in the world, the number of criminal cases is extraordinarily high. Last year alone, 189,548 criminal cases occurred. The majority of these criminals are probably those people whose will isn't weak. Forced by life, they have to take risks.

    同是苦命人
    东京出了一件惨案，一个失业教师被生活所逼，杀死了三个儿女和妻子以后自杀。报纸上竟把这个惨案归咎于这个失业教师的“意志薄弱”。人们不禁要问，如果意志不薄弱，又将如何呢？东京警视厅解答了这个问题。东京虽然有着世界城市中最多的警察，但是，犯罪案件却奇多，去年一年就发生了刑事案件十八万九千五百四十八起。这些犯罪者当中的大部分，大概就是那些意志不薄弱的人了。他们迫于生活，不得不挺而走险。
