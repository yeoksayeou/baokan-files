Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 17th: North Korea's agriculture achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1957. In that year, North Korea's grain output reached 3.2 million tons, an increase of 32% compared to 1944 before liberation. In addition, North Korea also produced 1.2 million tons of potato crops last year.

The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, in a circular issued on the 15th regarding the summary of last year's agricultural production and the tasks for this year's agricultural production, stated that the total output value of North Korea's agricultural production last year increased by 52% compared to 1954, the first year after the Korean War, and grain production increased by 42% compared to 1954. Last year, North Korea's special product, fruit, reached 110,000 tons, which is 3.8 times the output in 1954, setting a historical record for North Korea's annual fruit production. The circular stated that socialism has already achieved a decisive victory in the countryside. By the end of last year, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives accounted for 95.6% of the total number of peasant households, and the land of agricultural cooperatives accounted for 94% of the total cultivated area. The output of agricultural products and the income of members of agricultural cooperatives increased significantly last year. The poor peasants, who accounted for 30% of the total number of peasant households at the time of the Korean armistice, have now basically escaped poverty. The circular pointed out that the total planned grain output for the country this year is more than 3.3 million tons, and if the goals set by the agricultural activists' conferences in various provinces are combined, the grain output for this year will strive to reach more than 3.9 million tons.

   朝鲜北部去年农业大丰收
    95.6％农户加入农业社，社员收入有增加
    据新华社平壤17日电　1957年朝鲜北部农业获得了空前的丰收。这一年，朝鲜北部的粮食产量达到三百二十万吨，比解放前的1944年增加了32％。除此以外，朝鲜北部去年还生产了一百二十万吨薯类。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会在15日发出的关于去年农业生产的总结和今年农业生产任务的通报中说，去年朝鲜北部农业生产的总产值比朝鲜战争以后第一年1954年增长了52％，粮食产量比1954年增加了42％。去年朝鲜的特产水果的产量达到十一万吨，是1954年产量的三点八倍，创造了历史上朝鲜水果年产量的最高纪录。这项通报说，社会主义已经在农村中取得了决定性的胜利。到去年年底为止，入社农户数已占农户总数的95.6％，农业社的土地占耕地总面积的94％。各农业社去年的农产品产量和社员收入都有显著增加。在朝鲜停战时占农户总数30％的贫农，现在基本上摆脱了贫困状态。通报指出，今年国家计划的粮食总产量是三百三十多万吨，而把各道农业积极分子大会制订的奋斗目标综合起来，今年的粮食产量将要争取达到三百九十多万吨。
