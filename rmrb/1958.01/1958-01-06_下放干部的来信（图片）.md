    Letter from a Transferred Cadre
    Four hundred and fifty-two cadres from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce have been working as farmers in the Guogongzhuang Township Agricultural Cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing suburbs for more than three months. Last November, they wrote to their original office, reporting on their labor and life. This set of pictures records some of the scenes mentioned in that letter.
