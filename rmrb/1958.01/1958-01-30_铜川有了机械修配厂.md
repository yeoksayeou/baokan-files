    Tongchuan Now Has a Mechanical Repair Factory
    The Central Machine Repair Factory in the newly built Tongchuan Mining Area in Northwest China has officially begun production.

    This large-scale mine machinery repair factory was designed by the Shanghai Coal Mine Design Institute of the Ministry of Coal Industry with the assistance and review of Soviet experts.

    In addition to undertaking all major and medium repairs of coal mine machinery in the Tongchuan Mining Area, this factory can also process and manufacture castings and forgings commissioned by various mines in the Northwest and various accessories needed for repairing machinery.

    铜川有了机械修配厂
    西北新建的铜川矿区中央机修厂，已经正式投入生产。
    这座大型矿山机械修配厂，是煤炭工业部上海煤矿设计院在苏联专家的帮助和审查下设计的。
    这个厂除了担负铜川矿区全部煤矿机械大修中修任务外，还能加工制造西北各矿井委托的铸件锻件和修理机械所需要的各种配件。
