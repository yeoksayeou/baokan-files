The Agricultural Film Studio of the Ministry of Agriculture has provided more than 60,000 sets of agricultural slides for agricultural propaganda work in the past six years, including mutual aid and cooperation, agricultural machinery, water and soil conservation, soil fertilizer, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and other content. These slides introduced to farmers the superiority of agricultural cooperativization, cooperative management experience, yield-increasing measures for various crops, and advanced production experiences, which were very popular among farmers. For example, a set of slides entitled "Organization and Management of Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative," compiled by the studio in 1953, sold nearly 4,000 sets by the end of 1956. Other slides such as "Relying on Members to Run Cooperatives Diligently and Frugally," "Double-Wheel Double-Share Plow," "More Manure, More Production," "Cotton Sowing," "China's Marine Fisheries," "Building Water Conservancy to Ensure a Good Harvest," and "Raising Pigs to Accumulate Manure" were also popular among farmers.
    Now, in order to cooperate with the current agricultural propaganda work, the studio has newly compiled slides such as "Liu Jiemei Taking a New Path," "On the Fields of the Soviet Union," "Jiaozhuanghu Changing from Poor to Rich," "Wangcheng County's Experience in Comprehensively Developing Pig Raising," and introductions to the various pavilions of the National Agricultural Exhibition, totaling more than 20 types, and produced six documentaries. The documentaries will be released by the China Film Distribution Corporation. (Guo Fulin)

    六万多套农业幻灯片
    农业部农业电影社六年来为农业宣传工作提供了六万多套农业幻灯片，包括互助合作、农业机械、水土保持、土壤肥料、畜牧兽医和其他多种内容。这些幻灯片向农民介绍了农业合作化的优越性，合作社经营管理经验，各种作物的增产措施，以及先进生产经验等，很受农民欢迎。譬如该社1953年编制的一套“郭玉恩农业生产合作社的组织与经营管理”幻灯片，到1956年底就售出近四千套；其它如“依靠社员勤俭办社”、“双轮双铧犁”、“多积肥多增产”、“棉花播种”、“中国海洋渔业”、“兴修水利确保丰收”、“养猪积肥”等幻灯片，也都受到农民欢迎。
    现在该社为了配合当前的农业宣传工作，新编制幻灯片“重走新路的刘介梅”、“在苏联的田野上”、“由穷变富的焦庄户”、“望城县全面发展养猪的经验”以及全国农业展览会各馆介绍等二十多种，摄制了纪录片六部。其中纪录片将由中国电影发行公司总公司发行后映出。　（郭福林）
