    It's Better to Make Less Publicity
    US Secretary of the Navy Gates announced on the 13th that the US "Vanguard" rocket, which failed to launch on December 6 last year, is preparing for another launch in order to send a six-inch Earth satellite into orbit. However, in view of the last failure, the Secretary immediately added that this launch is only "an experiment," and there may be "a slight chance" of bringing the Earth satellite into orbit.
    Wanting to publicize and fearing embarrassment, that is the minister's predicament. However, his cautious reservation can only increase the ridiculousness of the matter.
    The United States has lost enough face in publicizing its Earth satellite, and people are tired of this kind of publicity. The best way to avoid embarrassment is to make less publicity.

    还是少作宣传好
    美国海军部长盖茨13日宣布，在去年12月6日发射失败的美国“先锋号”火箭，又在准备另一次发射，以便把一个六英寸的地球卫星送上轨道。可是，鉴于上一次的失败，这位部长马上补充说，这次发射不过是“一次试验”，也许有“少许的可能”把地球卫星带入轨道。
    又要宣传，又怕丢丑，这就是这位部长先生的苦衷。可是，他的谨慎的保留，只能增加这件事情的可笑程度。
    美国在宣传它的地球卫星的事情上丢的丑已经够多了，而且人们对这种宣传也感到厌倦了。要避免丢丑，最好的办法就是少作宣传。
