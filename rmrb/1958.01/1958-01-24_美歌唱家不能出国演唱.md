    American Singer Unable to Perform Abroad
    "The Daily Mirror" reports from Washington that the US State Department is preparing to once again refuse to issue a passport to the famous Black singer Paul Robeson, which means he will not be allowed to go to Britain to perform in a concert originally scheduled for April 6 on British television.
    The State Department has been refusing to allow Robeson to go abroad since 1953. At the same time, reactionary groups are doing everything possible to prevent him from performing in his own country. (Xinhua News Agency)

    美歌唱家不能出国演唱
    “每日镜报”自华盛顿报道，美国国务院准备再次拒绝发给著名黑人歌唱家保罗·罗伯逊出国护照，也就是不允许他到英国去作原定于4月6日在英国电视台的演唱。
    国务院从1953年以来一直拒绝允许罗伯逊出国。同时，反动集团又千方百计地阻挠他在本国演唱。（新华社）
