    You newspaper does not adequately reflect the current upsurge in rural production, and lacks substantial news reports and features. In the past, mentioning the production upsurge after collectivization was always exciting. But the current production upsurge is much higher than in previous years. Taking our Anhui Bengbu Special District as an example, by December 19 last year, we had completed over 340 million cubic meters of earth and stone work in water conservancy, completing the task for this winter and next spring 120 days ahead of schedule, equivalent to the total amount of water conservancy construction in the eight years since liberation. Now the entire district has proposed to complete another 208 million cubic meters of earth and stone work before the Spring Festival, which is also certain to be completed (Editor's note: According to a news report on winter production in Bengbu on page 1 of this newspaper on January 14, more than 580 million cubic meters of earthwork had been completed by January 11; and the additional task before the Spring Festival is 660 million cubic meters of earthwork). The farmers' slogan is: "Wind cannot blow us, rain cannot deter us, we will work until the 29th day of the twelfth lunar month." The achievements in accumulating manure are also significant. There are many materials worth writing news reports and features about. Recently, according to reports in the newspapers, many writers have gone to the countryside, and it is hoped that the writers will also pick up their pens and write more news reports and features in this regard.

    多登鼓舞革命干劲的通讯特写
    你报对于目前农村的生产高潮没有充分地反映，缺乏有分量的通讯、特写。过去一谈起合作化后出现的生产高潮，往往令人兴奋。但目前的生产高潮，比往年高得多。以我们安徽蚌埠专区来说，在兴修水利方面，到去年12月19日，已做土石方三亿四千多万公方，提前一百二十天完成去冬今春任务，相当于解放后八年兴修水利的总和。现在全区又提出在春节前再完成二亿零八百多万公方土石方，这也是有把握完成的（编者按：据1月14日本报一版所载蚌埠冬季生产新闻内称，到1月11日已做了五亿八千多万土方；而春节前的追加任务则为六亿六千多万土方）。农民们的口号是：“风吹不动，雨打不走，干到腊月二十九”。积肥的成绩也是显著的。这里面有许许多多值得写通讯、特写的材料。最近据报上报道，很多作家下到了农村，希望作家们也提起笔来多写些这方面的通讯、特写。
