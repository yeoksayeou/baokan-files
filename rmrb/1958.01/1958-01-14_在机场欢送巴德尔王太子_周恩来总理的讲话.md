Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Airport Bidding Farewell to Crown Prince Badr

Your Royal Highness Deputy Prime Minister Saif al-Islam Muhammad al-Badr of the Kingdom of Yemen: Friends, Comrades:

His Royal Highness Crown Prince Muhammad al-Badr of the Kingdom of Yemen and the distinguished Yemeni guests accompanying him are about to leave us to return home. As we are about to part, please allow me to once again, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, express my deepest gratitude to Your Royal Highness for your gracious visit to our country.

Your Royal Highness, your visit has left pleasant and indelible memories for the Chinese people. You have brought the profound friendship of the Yemeni people to the Chinese people, and through this visit, greatly enhanced the friendship established between the Chinese and Yemeni people in the common struggle to defend peace and safeguard national independence. During your visit, you also saw that the Chinese people cherish the friendship with the Yemeni people and regard the just struggle waged by the Yemeni people as a struggle closely related to their own. The leaders of the two governments held friendly and cordial talks on issues of common concern. Because our Asian and African countries have a common language and common feelings, it is easy to understand and approach each other. The leaders of the two governments reached unanimous agreement in the talks, issued a joint communique, and signed the Treaty of Friendship, the Treaty of Commerce, and the Agreement on Scientific, Technical and Cultural Cooperation between the two countries. This is of great significance for further developing and consolidating the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Conference spirit, and will also promote the friendly and cooperative relations between China and other Arab countries and Asian and African countries.

Your Royal Highness, please convey the sincere friendship of the Chinese people to the Yemeni people, and please also convey my cordial greetings and respect to His Majesty King Imam Ahmad!

I wish Your Royal Highness and the accompanying Yemeni guests a safe journey!

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Yemeni people!

Long live world peace!

    在机场欢送巴德尔王太子
    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下：朋友们、同志们：
    也门王国副首相塞弗·伊斯兰·穆罕默德·巴德尔王太子殿下和同来的也门贵宾们就要离开我们回国了。在我们将要分手的时候，请允许我再一次代表中国政府和中国人民深深地感谢王太子殿下这次盛情访问我国。
    王太子殿下，你这次访问给中国人民留下了愉快的和不可磨灭的记忆。你给中国人民带来了也门人民的深厚友情，并且通过这次访问大大地增进了中国和也门两国人民在保卫和平和维护民族独立的共同斗争中所建立起来的友谊。在访问过程中，你也看到了中国人民十分珍视同也门人民的友谊并且把也门人民所进行的正义斗争看作是同自己息息相关的斗争。两国政府的领导人就我们共同关心的问题进行了友好和亲切的会谈。由于我们亚非国家有共同的语言和共同的感情，彼此很容易了解和接近。两国政府领导人在会谈中取得了一致的意见，发表了联合公报，并且签订了两国的友好条约、商务条约和科学、技术与文化合作协定。这对于在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神的基础上进一步发展和巩固我们两国的友好合作关系具有重大的意义，并且也会促进中国同其他阿拉伯国家和亚非国家的友好合作关系。
    王太子殿下，请你把中国人民热诚的友谊带给也门人民，也请你转达我对伊玛姆·艾哈迈德国王陛下的亲切问候和敬意！
    祝王太子殿下和同行的也门贵宾们一路平安！
    中国和也门两国人民的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
