    Over Five Hundred Cadres from Peking University Sent Down

    (Our Newspaper) This paper reports that Peking University held a grand meeting on the afternoon of January 3rd to celebrate the first group of cadres approved to go up to the mountains and support other departments.

    This time, a total of 537 cadres were approved to go up to the mountains and support other departments. Among them, 326 were teachers and 211 were staff members; 339 went up to the mountains, and 198 supported other departments.

    The comrades going up to the mountains this time will go to the Jingxi mining area, the Zhaizang and Qingshui townships of the former Pingxi base area. The comrades who were approved were very excited. Ren Jiyu, associate professor of the Department of Philosophy, said, "I feel honored and excited that I have been approved to go to the countryside to participate in production." Wu Hongsen, associate professor of the Department of Western Languages, left Guangdong for the United States to study when he was a teenager and only returned to China in 1950. He said: "I lived in the United States for a long time and was deeply educated by the bourgeoisie, so it is necessary to go to labor to temper and transform myself."

    At the meeting, President Ma Yinchu hoped that the sent-down cadres would humbly learn from the peasants and help the peasants learn culture. Lu Ping, the first secretary of the Party committee, hoped that the sent-down cadres would rely closely on the Party and the masses, overcome difficulties, and fight against difficulties. He said that only after intellectuals have been tempered by labor can they become socialist cadres who can withstand risks. Liu Yuting, teaching assistant of the Department of Chemistry, also represented the sent-down cadres in assuring everyone that they were determined to learn from the peasants in labor and transform themselves to become working-class intellectuals.

    北京大学五百多干部下放
    本报讯　北京大学全校师生员工在3日下午举行了欢送第一批被批准上山和支援其他部门的下放干部大会。
    这次被批准上山和支援其他部门的下放干部共有五百三十七人。其中教师三百二十六人，职员二百一十一人；上山的三百三十九人，支援其他部门的一百九十八人。
    这次上山的同志将到京西矿区，过去平西根据地斋堂、清水两乡。被批准的同志都非常兴奋。哲学系副教授任继愈说，“这次批准我下乡参加生产，我感到光荣，也感到兴奋。”西语系副教授伍鸿森十多岁就离开广东到美国求学，1950年才回国，他说：“我长期生活在美国，受资产阶级的教育很深，因此有必要到劳动中去锻炼改造自己。”
    会上，马寅初校长希望下放干部虚心向农民学习，并帮助农民学文化。党委第一书记陆平希望下放干部紧紧依靠党、依靠群众，克服困难，向困难作斗争。他说知识分子经过劳动锻炼后，才能成为经得起风险的社会主义干部。下放干部化学系助教刘育亭也代表下放干部向大家保证，决心在劳动中向农民学习，改造自己，使自己成为工人阶级知识分子。
