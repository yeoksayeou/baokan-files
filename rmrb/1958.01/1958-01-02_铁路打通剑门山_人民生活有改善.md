    Railway Opens Up Jianmen Mountain, Improving People's Lives
    (Our report) The treacherous Shu Road, characterized by overlapping mountains and crisscrossing rivers, has been transformed into a smooth thoroughfare thanks to the opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Since the partial opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, it has transported more than 4.5 million tons of goods, of which 880,000 tons were transported from April, when full-line transportation services began, to the end of October last year. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway carried nearly 900,000 passengers between Baoji and Chengdu last year. The full operation of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has created favorable conditions for conducting construction in Sichuan more, faster, better, and more economically. The Southwest Radio Equipment Factory, Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, Chengdu Thermal Power Plant, and Chengdu Locomotive Repair Factory, which are under construction in Chengdu, have all received various construction materials and complete sets of equipment from the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. The Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau's 30-ton iron chain crane, the Locomotive Repair Factory's 16-meter-high bridge crane, and the Minjiang Hydropower Bureau's 23-ton transformer were all transported on schedule using special vehicles. In the past, machinery and equipment ordered by Chengdu's industrial sectors from other regions had to be shipped to Chongqing from Hankou and then transported to Chengdu along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. This not only involved multiple loading and unloading operations and long transportation times, but also prevented many large machines from being transported due to the lack of necessary mechanical loading and unloading equipment at Chongqing Port. Now, this situation is a thing of the past.
    Sichuan has been known as the "Land of Abundance" since ancient times, with abundant resources. In the past, many resources could not be transported out due to inconvenient transportation. The full operation of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway allows Sichuan to better support the construction of various parts of the country. From April to October last year, more than 640,000 tons of materials were exported through the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Sichuan's timber has been transported by rail to cities such as Lanzhou, Xi'an, and Nanjing. Sichuan's grain has also been transported by rail to disaster areas in Hebei and Anhui. In the past, Chongqing steel rails were shipped out by boat, but now they can be directly sent to the construction sites of new railways via the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Large quantities of Sichuan's oranges, tangerines, tea, pickled mustard tubers, sugar, wine, ham, eggs, and various local specialties and medicinal materials are also exported from here. Sichuan's hogs account for about one-fifth of the country's total. In the past, only preserved meat could be transported out, but now live pigs can be transported.
    The construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has promoted the economic prosperity of various regions along the line, especially the impoverished northwest Sichuan mountainous area before liberation. Now, this mountainous area has built more than 1,600 kilometers of simple roads, cart tracks, and pack animal trails on both sides of the railway, and roads to Beichuan and Qingchuan are currently under construction. There is a popular saying among the people in northwest Sichuan: "Mountains full of gold, mountains full of silver, as long as you bend your waist." This shows the abundance of its resources. There are more than 400 kinds of medicinal materials alone, but they could not be transported out in the past due to inconvenient transportation. Guangyuan County has more than 300 kinds of local specialties. In 1953, the supply and marketing cooperative only purchased more than 30 kinds. In 1954, when the Baoji-Chengdu Railway opened to Guangyuan, more than 100 kinds were purchased. After the full line opened last year, 232 kinds were purchased. Before the opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the famous Guangyuan fungus was exchanged for one catty of salt for every two catties of fungus, but now one catty of fungus can be exchanged for nine catties of salt. Last year alone, northwest Sichuan mountainous areas transported out sedge, oak bowls, red roots, and wild plant fibers such as mountain asbestos and ramie flower, which increased the income of mountain farmers by more than 100,000 yuan. In the past, these wild plants were used as firewood, fertilizer, or left to rot on the mountains, but now they have become industrial raw materials. From 1955 to 1957, farmers in Qingchuan, Pingwu, and Wangcang counties increased their income by more than 1.3 million yuan due to the opening of the railway and the increase in grain prices. The prices of industrial products in this region have also decreased due to the opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Therefore, the vast number of mountain farmers everywhere praised and said: "The railway opens up Jianmen Mountain, and the people have food and clothing."

    铁路打通剑门山　人民生活有改善
    本报讯　高山重叠、河流交错的蜀道天险，由于宝成铁路的通车变成了畅通无阻的大道。宝成路从部分通车以来，共运输了四百五十多万吨货物，其中八十八万吨是从去年4月办理全线运输业务以后，到10月底运输的。宝成铁路去年载运的往来宝鸡和成都之间的旅客将近九十万人次。宝成铁路的全线通车，给又多又快又好又省地在四川进行建设创造了有利的条件。正在成都修建的西南无线电器材厂、成都量具刃具厂、成都热电站和成都机车修理厂，都从宝成路运来了各种建筑材料和成套设备。西南建筑工程局的三十吨的铁链吊车，机车修理厂的十六公尺高的桥式吊车，岷江水电局的二十三吨重的变压器，都是用特种车辆按期运来的。过去成都工业部门在外区订购的机器设备，必须在汉口装船运到重庆，再沿成渝铁路运到成都。不仅装卸次数多、运输时间长，而且由于重庆港缺少必要的机械装卸设备，许多大型机器无法运来。现在，这种状况已一去不复返了。
    四川自古以来被称为天府之国，物产丰富，过去因为交通不便，许多物资不能运出，宝成铁路的全线通车，可以使四川更好地支援祖国各地的建设。去年4到10月，通过宝成铁路输出的物资共达六十四万多吨。四川的木材已经从铁路运到兰州、西安和南京等城市。四川的粮食也从铁路运到了河北和安徽灾区。重庆钢轨过去用船外运，现在可以通过宝成铁路直接送到新建铁路的工地。从这里大量输出的，还有四川的广柑、桔子、茶叶、榨菜、糖、酒、火腿、蛋品以及各种土特产和药材。四川毛猪约占全国的五分之一，过去只能运腊肉出去，现在可以运生猪了。
    宝成铁路的建成，促进了沿线各地特别是解放前以贫困著名的川西北山区经济的繁荣。现在这片山区已在铁路两边修建了简易公路、大车道和驮运道一千六百多公里，目前正修建通到北川、青川的公路。川西北民间流行着一句话：“金满山，银满山，只要把腰弯一弯。”由此可见其物产的丰富，单是药材就有四百多种，但过去因交通不便运不出来。广元县有三百多种土特产品，1953年供销社只收购三十多种，1954年宝成铁路通车到广元，收购了一百多种，去年全线通车后，收购了二百三十二种。著名的广元木耳在宝成铁路通车前，每两斤换一斤盐，现在一斤换九斤盐。去年仅川西北山区运出了簑草、青杠碗、红根以及野生植物纤维如山石棉、萝皮花等，给山区农民增加了十万多元的收入。过去这些野生植物被当作烧柴、肥料或在山上烂掉，现在都变成工业原料。青川、平武、旺苍三县农民从1955年到1957年，由于铁路修通、粮价调高，增加了一百三十多万元的收入。这地区的工业品的价格也因宝成铁路的通车而下降。因此，广大的山区农民到处赞仰地说：“铁路打通剑门山，人民有吃又有穿。”
