    The Transformation of Chu Family Hamlet
    Bo Tao
    "Pigs have pens, cows have stalls, sewage has buckets, toilets are covered, chickens and ducks are kept in cages, the courtyard is dry after rain, and the flagstones are as clean as a grinding disc."
    These are the words the masses of Chu Family Hamlet use to describe their hometown.
    From Xiaogan County in Hubei Province, heading northeast for more than twenty li, you arrive at Chu Family Hamlet in Pengxing Township. It is a flat basin where nineteen households reside. In front of the houses, there are several connected threshing grounds. Beside the threshing grounds are two large ponds, each with a small wooden sign. One is a pond specifically for washing vegetables, and the other is specifically for washing clothes and dirty items. Behind the hamlet, there is another pond filled with deep blue water, which is the drinking water pond. In a corner behind the hamlet, there is a rectangular yard, where a row of small houses are built. Twenty-four pigs and six cows are fed here. In another corner of the hamlet, there are three toilets for men and women.
    Each household's courtyard has a wooden bucket for collecting sewage. Wastewater from washing pots and other items is poured into the bucket. When the bucket is full, it is emptied into the manure pit. Every house and floor is swept clean. Even the roofs are free of dust. In the past, dozens of people in this hamlet would fall ill every summer, but in 1957, not a single person in the entire hamlet was sick.
    In 1957, the entire hamlet accumulated more than 23,200 dan of various household fertilizers, accounting for 80% of the fertilizer needed for the hamlet's 131 mu of land.
    Chu Family Hamlet transformed into this state through an ideological debate and arduous labor. In 1952, Chu Family Hamlet was like this: people slept next to livestock, and livestock rested by the stoves; sewage flooded the courtyards, and manure pits were scattered around the houses and ponds; the houses were dark and filled with flying dust, and the stench from chamber pots permeated the air. In hot weather, mosquitoes and flies swarmed, and the sick cried out in agony. Therefore, it was called "Stinky Family Hamlet" at that time. At that time, Communist Party member and township women's federation director Comrade Wu Haixiang, responding to the call of the Party and the government for cleanliness and hygiene and fertilizer production, first mobilized everyone in the mutual aid team she led to change the status quo of "Stinky Family Hamlet."
    Initially, the masses supported her initiative and offered many valuable suggestions. However, when it came to taking action, the masses raised a lot of objections, such as cleaning up was too time-consuming, and that moving earth was unlucky, etc. In response, Wu Haixiang helped everyone calculate the benefits of accumulating fertilizer and the advantages of cleanliness and hygiene, and she took the lead, leading several activists to start working. Seventy-nine dan of fertilizer were dug out of one courtyard and drainage ditch. Using the dust from the house to grow a vegetable garden, the vegetables grew luxuriantly and were not infested with insects. When the masses saw that there were results, they began to take action as well.
    In the spring of 1957, the masses of the entire hamlet responded to the call of the Party and the government to eliminate the four pests and launched a campaign to eliminate the four pests, catching a total of 291 rats and 202 sparrows. Currently, mosquitoes, flies, sparrows, and rats are rarely seen in the hamlet, and it has become a model hamlet for fertilizer accumulation and hygiene.

    楚家壪的变迁
    波涛
    “猪有圈，牛有栏，污水有桶，厕所加盖，鸡鸭笼里关，雨住天井干，石板干净像磨盘。”
    这是楚家壪群众形容他们家乡的几句话。
    从湖北省孝感县城向东北，走上二十多里路，就到了棚兴乡的楚家壪。那是一个平坦的盆地，十九户人家都住在这个小壪子里。门前，有几个接连在一起的稻场，稻场边上，有两口较大的堰塘，各插着一个小木牌，一个是洗菜专用塘，另一个是洗衣服和洗污物专用塘。壪子后边还有一个盛满深蓝色水的塘，那是饮水塘。在壪子背后的一个角上，有个长方形的院子，院子里盖着一排矮小的房子。二十四头猪和六头牛都喂在这里。壪子另外的角落，还有三个男、女厕所。
    每家的天井，都放一个盛污水的木桶。各家洗锅等用过的污水，都倒到桶里，水满了，就倒到粪窑里。每家的屋里、地下都打扫的干干净净。屋顶上也看不到灰尘。过去，这个壪子里每到夏天总要有几十人生病，但是1957年全壪子里没有一个人生病。
    1957年，全壪积的各种家园肥料就有二万三千二百多担，占全壪一百三十一亩田需肥量的80％。
    楚家壪变成这个样子，是经过一场思想论战和艰苦的劳动的。1952年的时候，那时的楚家壪是：人挨牲畜睡，牲畜靠着锅灶息；天井污水遍地漫，粪坑遍布屋、塘边；屋内漆黑阳尘飞，马桶臭气冲天，一到热天，蚊咬蝇啄，病人叫苦连天。所以当时有“臭家壪”的称呼。当时共产党员、乡妇联主任吴海香同志，响应党和政府关于清洁卫生、积肥生产的号召，首先在她所领导的那个互助组里，发动大家改变“臭家壪”的现状。
    起初，群众拥护她的倡议，并且提出过很多宝贵的建议。可是到了行动的时候，群众又提出了一大堆意见。如说打扫清洁太费工夫啦；又是怕什么动了土不吉利啦等等。针对这种情况，吴海香一面帮助大家算积肥的账，算清洁卫生好处账；一面自己带头，率领几个积极分子动手干起来。在一个天井和阳沟里，就挖了七十九担肥。用屋里的尘土种菜园，长的茂盛还不生虫。群众看见有搞头，也就跟着动起来了。
    1957年的春天，全壪群众响应党和政府除四害的号召，开展了除四害运动，共捉了老鼠二百九十一只，麻雀二百零二只。目前，壪里已经很少看见蚊、蝇、麻雀和老鼠，而成为积肥卫生模范壪了。
