    Car Factory Produces Gas Engine
    (Reported by this newspaper) In order to support the great leap forward in agricultural production, the First Automobile Works has specially trial-produced a kind of gas engine. It can be used to pump water to irrigate farmland, and it can also be installed with a transmission device to start threshing machines and other agricultural machinery. This engine uses coal as fuel, and the maximum number of revolutions per minute can reach about 4,200 revolutions, equivalent to 45 to 50 horsepower; the common number of revolutions is about 1,600 to 1,800, equivalent to 35 to 40 horsepower.
    The First Automobile Works plans to produce 1,000 such engines before the end of April 1958. Among them, 500 units will be supplied to Jilin Province. The First Automobile Works will send people to guide the installation and will be responsible for training 500 drivers to go to the countryside to participate in farmland water conservancy work.

    汽车厂制成煤气机
    本报讯　第一汽车制造厂为了支援农业生产大跃进，特地试制出一种煤气发动机。用它可以抽水灌溉农田，也可以安装传动装置，发动打谷机等农业机械。这种发动机使用煤作燃料，每分钟的最高转数能达四千二百转左右，相当于四十五匹到五十匹马力；常用转数一千六百到一千八百左右，相当于三十五匹到四十匹马力。
    第一汽车制造厂计划在1958年4月底以前，生产出一千台这种发动机。其中五百台供应吉林省，第一汽车制造厂将派人指导安装，并且负责训练出五百名司机，随同下乡参加农田水利工作。
