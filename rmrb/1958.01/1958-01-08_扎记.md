    Jottings

    The Whip Just Raised...
    The British Foreign Office spokesman explained to reporters on the 6th that Macmillan's speech on a "non-aggression pact" was not a "suggestion" but an "assertion." He said, "I don't think there is anything particularly new in this opinion." The spokesman meant that Macmillan's speech did not contain any noteworthy "suggestions."
    Since the British Prime Minister made an "assertion" to the world, why did he retract it as soon as it surfaced? Because the U.S. government adopted a cold, indifferent attitude towards Macmillan's "opinion," and also allowed the Associated Press to release information saying that the British suggestion "might cause a serious split between Britain and the United States."
    The "statesmen" of the dignified British Empire turned out to be people like this: the American whip had just been raised, and they were already trembling all over with fear.

    Pretending Not to See
    According to a recent report in the Italian newspaper "National Evening News," the U.S. President and the British Prime Minister reached a consensus during their meeting last October: the United States and Britain should use the border dispute between France and Libya to strengthen their position in North Africa. The method was to supply weapons to Libya to deal with France, while the U.S. and Britain "pretended not to see."
    The newspaper pointed out that this policy stemmed from the desire of the U.S. oil monopoly capital groups to seize Libya's oil resources. Britain, of course, also wanted to take the opportunity to gain some advantages.
    It turned out that the Tunisian arms supply incident was not unique. However, one incident has already broken out, while the other is being "pretended not to see" for the sake of Western "unity."

    Regardless of the Cost
    "National Evening News" also reported a secret revealed by "people close to the Macmillan government": implementing the above-mentioned "Anglo-American joint policy" in North Africa was one of the conditions for the Americans to set up missile bases in British territory.
    Britain is following the United States in undermining France, hoping to get a share of the spoils in the future. Whether this plan is realistic is a big question mark. However, U.S. missile bases are indeed about to be set up in Britain. To defend this matter, which harms British sovereignty and endangers British security, the British head of government has already spent a lot of effort in Parliament.
    For the sake of colonial interests, even the sovereignty and security of one's own country can be traded. It can truly be said that they are acting regardless of the cost.

    Should Not Sell One's Mouth
    The Asian-African Solidarity Conference was very successful, and it sent a resounding call to the world from the 1.7 billion people of Asia and Africa demanding peace and opposing imperialism. However, Japan's "Yomiuri Shimbun" was different, insisting that the conference "was a failure." The reason given was that "no speaker represented the West" at the conference.
    "Yomiuri Shimbun" has its own mouth, but insists on speaking for others, which is, of course, its freedom. But it demands that the people of Asia and Africa all sell their own mouths like it does, which is simply absurd.

    鞭子刚刚举起……
    英国外交部发言人6日向记者解释说，麦克米伦关于“互不侵犯条约”的演说不是一个“建议”，而是一种
  “主张”。他说：“我不认为这个意见里有什么特别新的东西”。这位发言人的意思是说，麦克米伦的演说里并没有提出过什么值得注意的“建议”。
    英国首相既然向全世界提出一项“主张”，为什么刚一冒头马上又缩回去呢？因为美国政府对麦克米伦的“意见”采取了一种冷冰冰的不理睬的态度，同时还让合众社出来放空气说，英国的建议“可能在英美之间引起严重的分裂”。
    堂堂大英帝国的“政治家”原来是这样一些人物：美国的鞭子刚刚举起来，他们就已经吓得全身打哆嗦了。
    装作看不见
    据意大利“国家晚报”最近透露，美国总统在去年10月和英国首相会谈中得出一致结论：美国和英国应该利用法国和利比亚之间的边境纠纷，以加强美英在北非的地位。办法也是通过武器的供应，让利比亚对付法国，而美英“装作看不见”。
    这家报纸指出，这个政策是出于美国石油垄断资本集团想夺取利比亚的石油资源。英国当然也想趁机占一点便宜。
    原来，突尼斯武器供应事件还无独有偶。不过一件是已经爆发出来，一件则为了西方“团结”的缘故，大家“装作看不见”而已。
    不顾血本
    “国家晚报”还报道了“接近麦克米伦政府的人士”所透露的一个秘密：在北非实行上述“英美联合政策”是让美国人在英国境内设置火箭基地的条件之一。
    英国跟着美国挖法国的墙脚，希望将来能分一杯残羹，这个打算是否现实还大成问题。但是，美国在英国的火箭基地却确实就要设置了。为了替这件有损英国主权和危及英国安全的事情辩护，英国政府首脑已经在议会里费了许多唇舌。
    为了殖民利益，连本国的主权和安全也可以拿出来交易。也真算得是不顾血本。
    不该出卖嘴巴
    亚非团结大会开得很成功，它向全世界发出了亚非十七亿人民要求和平与反对帝国主义的响亮呼声。然而日本的“读卖新闻”却与众不同，它硬说这个会议“是个失败”。原因据说是在这个会议上“没有一个发言人代表西方”。
    “读卖新闻”长着自己的嘴，却主张替别人讲话，这当然有它的自由，但是它竟要求亚非人民都像它这样出卖自己的嘴巴，那就未免太荒唐了。
