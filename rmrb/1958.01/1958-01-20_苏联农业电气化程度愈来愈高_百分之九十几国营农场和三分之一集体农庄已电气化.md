Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 19th. In recent years, the Soviet Union has achieved remarkable success in agricultural electrification. Last year, almost all machine tractor stations, over ninety percent of state farms, and more than one-third of collective farms had been electrified. In 1956, the electricity used in Soviet agriculture reached 4.9 billion kilowatt-hours, an eightfold increase compared to 1940, equivalent to 2.5 times the electricity used by the entire Russia before the October Revolution.

Soviet agricultural electrification developed rapidly after the Second World War. In 1940, electrified collective farms accounted for 4% of all collective farms, and electrified state farms and machine tractor stations accounted for 25%-30% of their total number. By 1950, the proportion of electrified state farms and machine tractor stations had risen to 76% and 80% respectively. From 1950 to 1956, the electricity used by state farms and machine tractor stations increased by 2.1 times and 2.6 times respectively. The electricity used by collective farms increased by 1.9 times from 1953 to 1956.

In 1916, the total generating capacity of rural power stations in Russia was only about 2,000 kilowatts, generating only about one million kilowatt-hours annually, while in 1956, the total generating capacity of Soviet rural power stations reached about 2.3 million kilowatts, generating more than 3.1 billion kilowatt-hours annually.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period (1956-1960), it was stipulated that the use of electricity should be further expanded in agricultural production. In addition to fully electrifying state farms and machine tractor stations, the number of electrified collective farms should be doubled.

The electrification of agricultural production can produce great economic benefits. Animal husbandry can save more than three-quarters of labor after the widespread use of electricity, and threshing and seed selection can save more than one-half of labor after electrification. Due to the improvement of mechanization and electrification levels, and the improvement of agricultural production organization, the labor productivity of the collective economy of Soviet collective farms increased by 48% from 1950 to 1956, and the labor productivity of state farms increased by 87% during the same period.

    苏联农业电气化程度愈来愈高
    百分之九十几国营农场和三分之一集体农庄已电气化
    据新华社莫斯科19日电　最近几年苏联在农业电气化方面取得了显著的成就。去年，几乎所有的机器拖拉机站、百分之九十几的国营农场和三分之一以上的集体农庄都已经电气化了。1956年，苏联农业使用的电力达到四十九亿度，比1940年增加了八倍，相当于十月革命前整个俄国使用的电力的二点五倍。
    苏联农业电气化是在第二次世界大战后迅速发展起来的。1940年，苏联电气化的集体农庄占全部集体农庄的4％，电气化的国营农场和机器拖拉机站占它们总数的25％—30％。1950年，国营农场和机器拖拉机站当中电气化的所占的比例分别上升到76％和80％。从1950年到1956年，国营农场和机器拖拉机站使用的电力分别增加了二点一倍和二点六倍。集体农庄使用的电力从1953年到1956年增加了一点九倍。
    1916年，俄国农村电力站的发电能力总共只有两千瓩左右，每年只能发电约一百万度，而1956年苏联农村电力站的总发电能力达到了约二百三十万瓩，每年可发电三十一亿多度。
    在第六个五年计划期间（1956—1960年），规定要在农业生产中进一步扩大使用电力，除了使国营农场和机器拖拉机站全部电气化外，还要使电气化的集体农庄的数目增加一倍。
    农业生产的电气化可以产生很大的经济效果。畜牧业在广泛使用电力以后可以节约四分之三以上的劳动，脱粒和选种等工作电气化后可以节约劳动二分之一以上。由于机械化、电气化水平的提高，农业生产组织工作的改进，苏联集体农庄公有经济的劳动生产率在1950年到1956年期间提高了48％，国营农场的劳动生产率在同一期间提高了87％。（附图片）
