Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th - In the United States, the works of famous writers such as Hemingway, Sinclair, Faulkner, Steinbeck, and Caldwell are not welcomed by publishers and bookstore owners. What they need is another kind of literature. "Writer" magazine has such "writers": they can "create" hundreds of short stories with "the magic of creating themes" or "the skills of a tailor," or piece together "works" that promote the "Cold War" and the policy of "positions of strength."

So said an article by Prudkov in the Soviet "Literary Gazette" when introducing the decline of American literature.

The article, entitled "The Literary Conveyor Belt of Big Business," pointed out that the defenders of bourgeois literature often boast about the "freedom of creation" in the capitalist world, which is completely absurd propaganda. There is no real freedom of creation in the United States; what is valued are the so-called "works" that can sell well in the market controlled by the wealthy. "Writer" magazine embodies the ugly situation of literary works being enslaved by business demands. In the catalog of "important books for writers" it introduces, we cannot see the names of world literary giants or the authors of serious and weighty critical works. Because these books cannot teach them the most important thing - how to make a fortune.

Prudkov said: "Gagnon" Enterprise Company in Los Angeles, USA, once published a book called "The Magic of Creating Themes." This book introduces a whimsical method of creating novels, believing that as long as you find nine writing "elements" as the "basis for imaginary themes," you can "create" novels. These "elements" can be found by relying on a so-called "theme robot." This "theme robot" is made of three pieces of cardboard stacked together. The middle piece of cardboard is a rotatable disk with hundreds of numbers written on it. The top piece of cardboard has a small hole carved in it, through which you can see a number on the disk. The "writer" rotates this disk nine times to record nine numbers, and according to these numbers, they can find their annotations in the "index." In this way, the "writer" can find everything he needs to write "elements."

The well-known female writer Owen in the American literary business world believes that writers can be compared to tailors. Because they must all have a sensitivity to form and a genius for structure, they should all be good at "assembling" various products. This "female writer" in an article she wrote, teaches others like a seamstress how to cut, alter, sew, and iron short stories in order to make them "best sellers" in the American market.

Prudkov pointed out that in the United States, there is also a literary business sector that is considered very prosperous, which is the film industry. Recently, the United States revised the film moral code, abolishing some past bans, allowing the depiction of black market drug trafficking, abortion, rape, adultery, child theft, and prostitution on the screen, with the proviso that these films must suit the tastes of the audience.

### 美国没有真正创作自由  富豪生意经支配着文学  苏联“文学报”刊文揭露

    美国没有真正创作自由  富豪生意经支配着文学
    苏联“文学报”刊文揭露
    新华社莫斯科9日电　在美国，名作家海明威、辛克莱、弗尔克纳、斯坦贝克、柯德威尔等人的作品并不受出版商和书店老板的欢迎。他们所需要的是另一种文学。“作家”杂志就拥有这样一些“作家”：他们用“制造题材的魔法”或“缝纫匠的技术”就可“创作”出数百篇短篇小说，或拼凑成宣传“冷战”和“实力地位”政策的“作品”。
    苏联“文学报”上一篇由普鲁德科夫署名的文章在介绍美国文学的没落情况时这样说。
    这篇题为“大生意的文学传送带”的文章指出，资产阶级文学的辩护人常吹嘘资本主义世界的“创作自由”，这完全是一种荒谬宣传。在美国没有真正的创作自由，受重视的只是那些在受富豪们控制的市场上能够畅销的所谓“著作”。“作家”杂志就体现了文学著作同生意要求的奴役关系的丑恶情景。在它介绍的“作家用的重要书籍”的目录中，我们看不到世界文学巨匠的名字或严肃而有份量的评论著作的作者的名字。因为这些书不能教给他们最重要的东西——发财之道。
    普鲁德科夫说：美国洛杉矶的“加格农”企业公司曾出版一本名为“制造题材的魔法”的书。这本书介绍了一种异想天开的小说创作法，认为只要找出九个写作“要素”，作为“空想出来的题材的基础”就可以“创作”出小说了。这些“要素”可以依靠所谓“题材机械人”来找到。这种“题材机械人”是由三块叠在一起的纸板来制成的。中间那一块纸板是一个可旋转的圆盘，上面写着几百个数字。叠在最上面的那一块纸板上雕有一个小孔，透过这个小孔就可以看到圆盘上的一个数目字。“作家”把这个圆盘旋转九次就可记下九个数目字，根据这些数目字，在“索引”中就可找到它们的注释。这样，“作家”就可找到他所需要的一切写作“要素”了。
    美国文学生意界驰名的女作家欧恩认为作家可与缝纫匠相比。因为他们都必须具有对形态的敏感和结构的天才，他们都应该善于“装配”各种制品。这位“女作家”在她写的一篇文章中像缝纫师那样教授别人如何剪裁、翻改、缝纫和熨平短篇小说，以便使它们成为美国市场上的“畅销品”。
    普鲁德科夫指出，在美国，还有一个被人认为十分景气的文学生意部门，那就是电影。最近，美国改订了电影道德规程，取消了过去的一些禁令，允许在银幕上表现麻醉品的黑市买卖、堕胎、强奸、通奸、儿童盗窃和卖淫等行为，其附带条件是：这些影片必须合乎观众胃口。
