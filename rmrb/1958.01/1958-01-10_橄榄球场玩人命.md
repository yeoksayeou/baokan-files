    Playing with Lives on the Football Field

    Washington, January 6 (Xinhua) – The American Football Conference revealed on the 6th that, in the past twenty-odd years, an average of twenty-six people have died each football season as a result of playing this sport. Half of those who died were young people aged sixteen to eighteen.

    The association stated that the majority of deaths are the result of brain concussions caused by violent collisions.

    American football is one of the most popular sports in the United States. The ball used in the game is small at both ends and oval-shaped, hence it is also known as a rugby ball. Its playing field is about the same size as a soccer field, and the goalposts are larger and taller than those in a regular soccer game, positioned on the end line. Each side has eleven players. Although this sport is called football, in reality, kicking the ball with the foot is rare. Offensive players score by carrying the ball across the opponent's goal line or kicking the ball over the goal line. However, running with the ball across the opponent's goal line scores the most points.

    When the ball carrier on the offensive side is tackled to the ground, it counts as a dead ball. If the offensive side fails to advance ten yards after four dead balls, they lose their offensive opportunity. Defenders can use various methods such as tackling and blocking to bring down the opponent. Offensive players can also use similar methods to protect the ball carrier or clear the way for him. Because the movements during the game are extremely rough, participants in this sport must wear heavy armor and hard helmets for protection. However, despite this, broken necks and fractured bones are still common occurrences during the game. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 橄榄球场玩人命

    橄榄球场玩人命
    美国橄榄球联合会6日透露，在过去二十多年中，每一个实榄球季由于打这种球而受伤致死的人平均达二十六人。这些死亡的人中有半数是十六岁到十八岁的青年。
    联合会说，死亡的大多数是因为猛撞而大脑受到震荡的结果。
    美国式足球是美国最普遍流行的运动项目之一，比赛用的球两头小，呈橄榄形，所以又被称为橄榄球。它的比赛场地同足球场差不多大，球门架比普通足球赛中的要高大，设在底线上。比赛双方各为十一人。这种运动虽然称为足球，但实际上用脚踢球的时候很少。进攻者抱着球越过对方球门线，或把球踢过球门线即可得分。但抱着球冲过对方球门得分最多。
    进攻一方的持球者被撞倒地即算死球一次，进攻一方死球四次而未能向前推进十码时即失去进攻机会。防守者可以使用撞、挡等各种办法把对方击倒，进攻者也可用同样方法掩护持球者前进，或为他开路，由于比赛时动作极为粗野，所以参加这项运动的人必须身穿重甲，头戴硬盔，以资保护，但是尽管如此比赛中也少不了要发生断颈折骨的事件。　（新华社）
