Stone Lake
Xidi

Two years ago, when returning to Suzhou from Dongshan in Taihu Lake, I passed through Stone Lake. I was on a small motorboat, and in the blink of an eye, the boat entered another lake through a narrow waterway. This lake was much smaller than Taihu Lake, with crab traps and water chestnut fields everywhere. They told me, "This is Stone Lake." I stood up abruptly and looked around from the bow, trying to absorb as much of the scenery of Stone Lake as possible. I saw a small island in the center of the lake, with many oddly shaped Taihu rocks remaining. I thought, "Isn't this the remnant of an ancient garden?"

Yes, the entire Stone Lake was originally a large garden. More than eight hundred years ago, it was the garden of Fan Chengda (1126-1193), a poet from the early Southern Song Dynasty. He, along with Lu You and Yang Wanli, were known as the three great poets of the Southern Song Dynasty. Because Chengda lived here, he called himself the Stone Lake Hermit, and "Stone Lake" became famous throughout the world because of it. Yang Wanli said, "The Duke's villa is called Stone Lake, and the beauty of its mountains and waters is unsurpassed in the southeast." We long for Stone Lake because we have read Fan Chengda's poems about Stone Lake. "Stone Lake" and Fan Chengda have formed such an inseparable relationship, just like Tao Yuanming's "Chestnut Village" and Wang Wei's "Wangchuan," where people are named after places, and at the same time, places are made famous by people. Chengda's "Stone Lake Hermit Poetry Collection," a version engraved by the Gu family of W郡 (1688 engraving), has a total of thirty-four volumes, many of which are poems praising the local customs and conditions of Stone Lake. He is an important pastoral poet in the history of Chinese literature, inheriting the excellent traditions of Tao Yuanming and Wang Wei, and describing the hard lives of farmers more than eight hundred years ago. His "Si Shi Tian Yuan Za Xing Sixty Poems" (Si Shi Tian Yuan Za Xing means "Four Seasons of Pastoral Life"), was written in Stone Lake in the Chunxi Bingwu year (1186). It is filled with the pastoral flavor of Jiangnan. Like reading the landscapes painted by Mi Fu and his son Mi Youren, the paper is full of clouds and water, the moisture of Jiangnan, and the familiar lake fields and the activities of farming, raising silkworms, and weaving silk. He wrote:

　　"During the day, they plow the fields, at night they spin hemp, the village children each manage their own homes.
　　The young grandchildren do not yet understand how to provide for farming and weaving, but also learn to plant melons beside the mulberry shade." There will not be an "idle person" in the countryside, including the children.

　　"The completion of the harvest is difficult, fearing rain, disliking wind, and even more afraid of cold.
　　I beg the heavens to leave some leftovers, half to repay private debts and half to hand over to the government." He sympathizes with the suffering of the peasants being exploited. Even more difficult are those who do not even have fields to cultivate.

　　"Picking water chestnuts is hard work, abandoning plows, bloodied fingers flow like red dye, ghostly and withered.
　　Unable to buy fields, they simply plant in the water, and recently even the lake surface is rented." He lived on Stone Lake, loved the local customs and conditions, and loved the farmers there, and expressed sympathy for their suffering. Later, during the Hongzhi period of the Ming Dynasty (1488-1505), Mo Dan wrote a "Stone Lake Chronicle," but it only boasted about the luxurious lives of the Mo family landlords, and had no meaning at all. Today, there is no trace of the Mo family left on Stone Lake, and when people are asked, they do not know, and they are "body and name both decayed." But everyone knows Fan Chengda's name.

Last spring, I went to Dongshan, Taihu Lake again. This time I went by land. In one year, the local farmers had already built a highway leading to Suzhou. People from an agricultural cooperative in Dongshan told me the year before:

　　"We want to build a car road to Suzhou to welcome tractors."

Sure enough, this highway has been built. Now, to go to Dongshan, there is no need to go by water, and there is no need to spend a day or two. In less than two hours, you can go directly from Suzhou to Dongshan, Taihu Lake. We took this highway and arrived at Stone Lake. We saw the vast lake water from afar, lying there quietly, as if the water was calm and everything was silent. Gradually approaching, the beauty of the lake and mountains was gradually revealed. An old, dilapidated house, with a depth of three courtyards, first attracted our attention. The front hall was still relatively intact, but the back was very dilapidated. The roof could already see the blue sky, and broken tiles and bricks were scattered all over the ground. The walls were also half collapsed. This is Fan Chengda's ancestral hall. There are still stone carvings of his "Si Shi Tian Yuan Za Xing" embedded in the walls, but they are no longer complete. We walked along the lake, on the not-so-high mountains. The surrounding scenery is exceptionally beautiful. The full lake water kept lapping at our feet, but gently retreated, like a loving mother stroking a sleeping baby, gently stroking the stone bank. The broken pieces of porcelain in the water were clearly visible. Small fish and lively small shrimp were swimming and jumping in front of our eyes. Climbing to the top of the mountain, you can see the even more distant Taihu Lake. The sails on Taihu Lake are clearly visible. The sunlight shines on the rippling lake water, glittering with golden light, like countless fish turning over all at once. In the green fields, mixed with yellow rapeseed fields and purple alfalfa fields, spread out like embroidery under our feet.

The lake water here nourishes the mulberry, hemp, and rice in the nearby areas, and also provides abundant fish and shrimp. The working people love it and value it.

　　"We are preparing to green this entire area and have already planted many saplings," said the head of the Suzhou Garden Bureau who was accompanying us.

Sure enough, many various kinds of short trees were planted up and down, high and low. In less than ten years, this will be a very secluded and clean mountain forest. He said, "The Garden Bureau has a plan to renovate the entire Stone Lake area and turn it into a park." Of course, this is very meaningful, and the Dongshan area has become a sanatorium for workers in the Shanghai area, so it is necessary to build this Stone Lake Park.

He also said, "We must protect the famous historical sites in this area and renovate Fan Shih's ancestral hall. With the relics of that famous poet, wouldn't Stone Lake be even more beautiful?"

More than a year has passed, and I don't know if the construction of Stone Lake Park has started yet? I believe that just like the highway between Suzhou and Dongshan, the hardworking and brave people of Suzhou will build Stone Lake Park extraordinarily beautiful and attractive, to welcome the visits and recuperation of the labor models of the working class.

    石湖
    西谛
    前年从太湖里的洞庭东山回到苏州时，曾经过石湖。坐的是一只小火轮，一眨眼间，船由窄窄的小水口进入了另一个湖。那湖要比太湖小得多了，湖上到处插着蟹簖和围着菱田。他们告诉我：“这里就是石湖。”我矍然的站起来，在船头东张西望的，想尽量地吸取石湖的胜景。见到湖心有一个小岛，岛上还残留着东倒西歪的许多太湖石。我想：“这不是一座古老的园林的遗迹么？”
    是的，整个石湖原来就是一座大的园林。在离今八百多年前，这里就是南宋初期的一位诗人范成大（1126—1193 年）的园林。他和陆游、杨万里同被称为南宋三大诗人。成大因为住在这里，就自号石湖居士，“石湖”因之而大为著名于世。杨万里说：“公之别墅曰石湖，山水之胜，东南绝境也。”我们很向往于石湖，就是为了读过范成大的关于石湖的诗。“石湖”和范成大结成了这样的不可分的关系，正像陶渊明的“栗里”，王维的“辋川”一样，人以地名，同时，地也以人显了。成大的“石湖居士诗集”，吴郡顾氏刻的本子（1688年刻），凡三十四卷，其中歌咏石湖的风土人情的诗篇很不少。他是一位中国文学史上重要的田园诗人，继承了陶渊明、王维的优良传统，描写着八百多年前的农民的辛勤的生活。他的“四时田园杂兴六十首”，就是淳熙丙午（1186年）在石湖写出的，在那里，充溢着江南的田园情趣，像读米芾和他的儿子米友仁所作的山水，满纸上是云气水意，是江南的润湿之感，是平易近人的熟悉的湖田农作和养蚕、织丝的活计，他写道：
    昼出耘田夜绩麻，村庄儿女各当家。
    童孙未解供耕织，也傍桑阴学种瓜。农村里是不会有一个“闲人”存在的，包括孩子们在内。
    垂成穑事苦艰难，忌雨嫌风更怯寒。
    笺诉天公休掠剩，半偿私债半输官。他是同情于农民的被剥削的痛苦的。更有连田也没有得种的人，那就格外的困苦了。
    采菱辛苦废犁鉏，血指流丹鬼质枯。
    无力买田聊种水，近来湖面亦收租。他住在石湖上，就爱上那里的风土，也爱上那里的农民，而对于他们的痛苦，表示同情。后来，在明朝弘治间（1488—1505年），有莫旦的，曾写了一部“石湖志”，却只是夸耀着莫家的地主们的豪华的生活，全无意义。至今，在石湖上莫氏的遗迹已经一无所存，问人，也都不知道，是“身与名俱朽”的了。但范成大的名字却人人都晓得。
    去年春天，我又到了洞庭东山。这次是走陆路的，在一年时间里，当地的农民已经把通往苏州的公路修好了。东山的一个农业合作社里的人，曾经在前年告诉过我：
    “我们要修汽车路，通到苏州，要迎接拖拉机。”
    果然，这条公路修好了，如今到东山去，不需要走水路，更不需要花上一天两天的时间了，只要两小时不到，就可以从苏州直达洞庭东山。我们就走这条公路，到了石湖。我们远远地望见了渺茫的湖水，安静地躺在那里，似乎水波不兴，万籁皆寂。渐渐地走近了，湖山的胜处也就渐渐地豁露出来。有一座破旧的老屋，总有三进深，首先唤起我们注意。前厅还相当完整，但后边却很破旧，屋顶已经可看见青天了，碎瓦破砖，抛得满地。墙垣也塌颓了一半。这就是范成大的祠堂。墙壁上还嵌着他写的“四时田园杂兴”的石刻，但已经不是全部了。我们在湖边走着，在不高的山上走着。四周的风物秀隽异常。满盈盈的湖水一直溢拍到脚边，却又温柔地退回去了，像慈母抚拍着将睡未睡的婴儿似的，它轻轻地抚拍着石岸。水里的碎磁片清晰可见。小小的鱼儿，还有顽健的小蝦儿，都在眼前游来蹦去。登上了山巅，可望见更远的太湖。太湖里点点风帆，历历可数。太阳光照在潾潾的湖水上面，闪耀着金光，就像无数的鱼儿在一刹那之间，齐翻着身。绿色的田野里，夹杂着黄色的菜花田和紫色的苜蓿田，锦绣般地展开在脚下。
    这里的湖水，滋育着附近地区的桑麻和水稻，还大有鱼蝦之利。劳动人民是喜爱它的，看重它的。
    “正在准备把这一带全都绿化了，已经栽下不少树苗了。”陪伴着我们的一位苏州市园林处的负责人说道。
    果然有不少各式各样的矮树，上上下下，高高低低地栽种着。不出十年，这里将是一个很幽深新洁的山林了。他说道：“园林处有一个计划，要把整个石湖区修整一番，成为一座公园”。当然，这是很有意义的，而且东山一带已将成为上海一带的工人的疗养区，这座石湖公园是有必要建设起来的。
    他又说道：“我们要好好地保护这一带的名胜古迹，范石湖的祠堂也要修整一下。有了那个有名的诗人的遗迹，石湖不是更加显得美丽了么？”
    事隔一年多，不知石湖公园的建设已经开始了没有？我相信，正像苏州——洞庭东山之间的公路一般，勤劳勇敢的苏州市的人民一定会把石湖公园建筑得异常漂亮，引人入胜，来迎接工农阶级的劳动模范的游览和休养的。
