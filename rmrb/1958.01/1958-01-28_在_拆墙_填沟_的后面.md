Behind "Demolishing Walls" and "Filling Ditches"
    Yan Xiang
    There was a period last year when the terms "walls" and "ditches" were very popular. Terms like "walls within walls" and "ditches outside walls" temporarily obscured the true relationship between the Party and the masses, as if people had run into a "ghost wall." Everywhere there were "walls" like forests, and "ditches" like ravines.

    After the anti-Rightist struggle, people saw two kinds of people among those who were shouting about "walls" and "ditches": friends and enemies. The former were those who, with a pragmatic attitude, kindly pointed out some abnormal phenomena existing in the relationship between the Party and the masses, and specifically identified the causes of certain estrangements: which were caused by the evils of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism; and which were due to the fact that some people's old ideas and old styles of work had not been transformed and were incompatible with the Party. Therefore, they proposed that everyone work together to "demolish walls" where there were "walls" and "fill ditches" where there were "ditches." Their purpose was to demolish "walls" and fill in "ditches." They were true friends of the Party.

    The latter, however, were not for this purpose. They harbored ulterior motives, stirred up trouble, deliberately exaggerated and distorted the facts, shouted that there were "walls" and "ditches" everywhere, and slandered the Party as a sectarian group, with the aim of trying to uproot the Party. They were the Party's vicious enemies.

    Huang Liwen's article "The Ghost Lingers" (see page 8 of the People's Daily, May 25, 1957) regarded the Communist Party as a sectarian fortress, demanding "demolishing walls" and "filling ditches." The "ghost" referred to by the author is sectarianism. The title of the article, "The Ghost Lingers," refers to the "undying soul" of sectarianism. In the article, the author seized upon the example of the rectification forum held by the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Writers Association and a certain publishing house in Shanghai, and used it as an excuse to exaggerate, falsely claiming that the Party had a "preference" for the three isms and had "taboos." The "preference" was for opposing dogmatism, and the "taboo" was for opposing sectarianism, while bureaucracy was somewhere in between. Why was opposing sectarianism a "taboo"? The author said that this was because they were afraid of "demolishing walls" and afraid of "digging" away the "foundations." Therefore, anyone who wanted to criticize sectarianism would be suppressed by "gagging" and threatening with the means of "letting you know 'I am here, you have to be careful...'" Moreover, the author more bluntly said that this terrible force, in the past with the force of "Mount Tai pressing down," suffocated the masses, and today it is still "like a mountain, motionless," making the masses afraid to speak. The result is: "Preserving deep trenches and high ramparts, even if everyone is 'sincerely welcomed' to criticize dogmatism and not suppressed to criticize bureaucracy, it is difficult to achieve the real purpose. If others have concerns, how can they fully express their feelings? In the end, they can only sigh at the ditches and feel cold at the ramparts. Forcing themselves to say a few words is like scratching an itch from afar, and it is of no avail."

    In this way, it is difficult not to think that the author is not opposing some "sectarianism," but is implying behind "demolishing walls" and "filling ditches" that the Party is a sectarian group that builds high walls, digs deep ditches, and resides within them to protect itself; that the Party's rectification movement is hypocritical and deceptive. We will not explore the author's motives for publishing these remarks, but judging from the essence of his remarks, it cannot but be slander and defamation of the Party. The Party launched the rectification movement and openly called on everyone to oppose the three major isms. This action itself powerfully proves that the Party's attitude towards opposing sectarianism is resolute. Because it is fundamentally incompatible with the Party's principles and is harmful and useless to the revolutionary cause. It is completely unfounded to say that the Party has a "taboo" against opposing sectarianism, and it is even more absurd to point out that the Party is a sectarian group. Is it in accordance with the facts to say that a party that starts from uniting 600 million people, takes the will of the whole people as its will, and leads the people of the whole country on the road to socialist prosperity, is a sectarian group, a "Mount Tai" pressing down on the people?

    Is there sectarianism in certain organizations and certain members of the Party? Of course, there is. Some party members, complacent and arrogant, engage in independence, consider problems only from the perspective of local interests, regardless of the overall situation, do not start from unity, are arrogantly self-respecting towards non-Party members, and look down on others. These phenomena are all manifestations of sectarianism. This is alienation from the masses, unfavorable to unity, and the main reason for certain estrangements between the Party and the masses. This is also what the Party resolutely opposes at all times. One of the main contents of this rectification of the Party is to eliminate this bad phenomenon. Facts have also proved that in many places, the masses have eliminated this phenomenon by means of big contending, big blooming, and big-character posters, and the unity between the Party and the masses has been strengthened. This is a powerful refutation of the "conclusion" that Huang Liwen "prematurely" gave to the Party's rectification movement: it is impossible to "fully express one's feelings," and one can only "sigh at the ditches and feel cold at the ramparts."

### 在“拆墙”“填沟”的后面

    在“拆墙”“填沟”的后面
    言襄
    去年有一个时期，“墙”和“沟”的说法甚为盛行。什么“墙内有墙”、“墙外有沟”，一时间，党和群众的真实关系被乌云掩遮了起来，好像遇到了“鬼打墙”，到处是“墙”如森林，“沟”壑纵横了。
    经过一场反右派斗争，人们在喊“墙”和“沟”的人中，看清了两种人：朋友和敌人。前一种人，是以实事求是的态度，善意地指出党群关系中存在的某些不正常现象，并具体找出产生某些隔阂的原因：哪些是由于主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义作怪造成的；哪些是由于一些人的旧思想、旧作风未经改造，和党格格不入的。因此提出大家一齐动手，有“墙”的“拆墙”，有“沟”的“填沟”。他们的目的是为了拆掉“墙”，填平“沟”。他们是党的真正朋友。
    后一种人，却不是为了这个。他们居心叵测，大肆兴风作浪，故意夸大歪曲事实，大喊到处有“墙”和“沟”，诬蔑党是一个宗派主义集团，其目的是企图把党连根拔除。他们是党的凶恶敌人。
    黄立文的“幽灵徘徊不去”（见1957年5月25日人民日报八版）一文，便是把共产党看作一个宗派主义堡垒，来要求“拆墙”“填沟”的。作者所谓“幽灵”者，即指宗派主义而言。文章的题目是“幽灵徘徊不去”，即指宗派主义“阴魂”不散。在文章中，作者抓住中国作家协会广州分会和上海某出版社召开的整风座谈会为例，借题发挥，诬称党对三个主义有“偏爱”，有“禁忌”。“偏爱”的是反教条主义，“禁忌”的是反宗派主义，官僚主义则介乎二者之间。为什么“禁忌”反宗派主义呢？作者说，这是怕“拆墙”，怕“挖”掉“墙脚”。因此，谁若要批评宗派主义，就非用“堵嘴”和“让你知道‘我在这里，你得当心点，……’”的恐吓手段压下去不可。而且，作者更露骨地说：这种可怕的势力，过去以“泰山压顶”之势，压得群众透不过气来，今天仍然“像一座山一样，一动不动”，使群众不敢开口。结果是：“保住深沟高垒，即便‘竭诚欢迎’大家批评教条主义和不压制大家批评官僚主义，也是很难达到真正的目的。别人有了顾虑，怎能尽倾肺腑之言，结果还不是望沟兴叹，望垒心寒。勉强说几句，形同隔靴搔痒，无济于事。”
    这样，就很难不使人认为作者不是在反对什么“宗派主义”，而是在“拆墙”“填沟”的后面，暗示人们：党是一个筑高墙、挖深沟、居其内以保护自己的宗派主义集团；党的整风运动是虚伪的、骗人的。我们姑且不去探讨作者发表这些言论的动机是什么，但就其言论的实质看，不能不是对党的诬蔑和诽谤。党发动整风运动，公开号召大家反对三大主义，这一行动本身就有力地证明了党反对宗派主义的态度是坚决的。因为它和党的原则根本不能相容，对革命事业有害无益。说党“禁忌”反对宗派主义，是丝毫没有根据的，进而指党是宗派主义集团，更是信口雌黄。难道把一个一切都从团结六亿人口出发，以全民的意志为意志，领导全国人民走社会主义富强道路的党，说成是一个宗派主义集团，是压在人民头上的“泰山”，是符合事实的吗？
    党的某些组织和某些党员中，有没有宗派主义呢？当然有。有些党员，居功自傲，闹独立性，考虑问题只看局部利益，不顾全大局，不从团结出发，对党外人士妄自尊大，看人家不起等现象，都是宗派主义的表现。这是脱离群众，不利于团结，造成党群之间存在某些隔阂的主要原因。这也是党在任何时候都坚决反对的。这次党进行整风的主要内容之一，就是要反掉这种坏现象。事实也证明了，在许多地方，群众用大鸣、大放、大字报的方式，消除了这种现象，党群之间更加团结了。这是对黄立文“过早”地给党的整风运动下的“结论”：不能“尽倾肺腑之言”，只有“望沟兴叹，望垒心寒”，给予的有力驳斥。
