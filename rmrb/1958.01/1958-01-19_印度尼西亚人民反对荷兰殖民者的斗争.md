    The Indonesian People's Struggle Against Dutch Colonists
    Xie Lingfeng, Shen Dingyi
    (I) The December Storm

    In December 1957, the Indonesian people launched a powerful mass movement demanding the recovery of West Irian, which quickly swept across the country.

    The struggle began after the United Nations refused to pass the proposal of Indonesia and 18 other countries. At this point, the Indonesian people could no longer contain the anger that had been suppressed in their hearts for so long. They saw that, under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations could not even pass a proposal allowing Indonesia and the Netherlands to negotiate directly on the issue of West Irian, and it was impossible to rely on the United Nations to recover West Irian.

    As President Sukarno said, "It is not the United Nations that can decide the fate of West Irian, but the Indonesian people themselves." The Indonesian people decided to use their own strength, outside the United Nations, to liberate West Irian through "other means." They quickly took action and launched a heroic struggle against the Dutch colonialists.

    On December 2, under the leadership of the government, Indonesian employees in all Dutch enterprises in Indonesia held a general strike. The next day, the workers launched a vigorous movement to take over Dutch enterprises. The struggle initially targeted Dutch monopoly enterprises, because this was the root of Dutch colonialism, the crux of the poverty and backwardness of the Indonesian people for hundreds of years.

    Workers in Jakarta first took over the Dutch Royal Shipping Company and the Yu Meili Trading Company, one of the five major foreign firms. Then, the struggle to take over Dutch monopoly enterprises spread to all parts of the country. At this time, on all the islands and oceans of Indonesia, wherever there were Dutch trading companies, shops, factories, ships, and wharves and warehouses, the employees organized various forms of takeover committees, property supervision groups, or factory protection teams. They began to take over Dutch enterprises or supervise the activities of Dutch business owners to prevent damage to the enterprises. Within a week, the workers had taken over many large Dutch enterprises, including the general headquarters of the five major Dutch trading companies, the three major banks, and the Dutch Royal Shipping Company, as well as many of their branches and sub-branches in various places, and many large factories and shops.

    This was an exciting week. In Jakarta, one could see Indonesian employees full of enthusiasm standing in front of the buildings of Dutch enterprises every day. They climbed up high buildings, lowered the Dutch red, white, and blue flag, and raised the Indonesian red and white flag. They hung large red cloths with the words "Indonesian Property" in front of the doors. Indonesian employees wearing red armbands solemnly stood guard at the entrances of some large Dutch banks and trading companies to prevent Dutch capitalists and their lackeys from stealing important documents and property.

    Representatives of Indonesian workers entered the manager's offices inside these tall buildings, read out the "Takeover Declaration" to the Dutch managers, and ordered them to hand over the keys and account books.

    In this vigorous anti-Dutch struggle, the Indonesian people and the government showed the power of unity. Trade unions of various tendencies acted in unison, cooperated with each other, and complied with the regulations of the government and military authorities. The government also supported the actions of the masses. Two days after the workers took over the Dutch Royal Shipping Company, the Indonesian cabinet held a meeting to ratify the takeover action of the masses. The government and military authorities made a series of important decisions: announcing the control of all Dutch enterprises (excluding Dutch and other foreign joint venture oil enterprises) and Dutch plantations, closing Dutch consulates throughout the country, ordering unemployed Dutch expatriates to leave the country, freezing all profit remittances from Dutch enterprises, prohibiting Dutch-language newspapers from being published and distributed in Indonesia, and prohibiting Dutch airline planes from landing in Indonesia. These decisions of the government fundamentally struck at the Dutch colonialist monopoly position in Indonesia, and this was also an action to implement the abolition of the Round Table Conference agreements, which the people of the whole country had long hoped for.

    The Indonesian people and government have shown the world their strength and their determination to recover West Irian and eliminate colonialism!

      (II) The Plunder of Dutch Colonists

    The current anti-Dutch struggle of the Indonesian people is not only about demanding the return of West Irian, but is a continuation of the Indonesian Revolution for Independence in 1945, and is for Indonesia to achieve complete political and economic independence.

    Since Indonesia declared its independence in 1945, due to the signing of the Round Table Conference agreements (although this agreement was declared abolished by Indonesia the year before last, various measures to implement the abolition have not yet been specifically implemented), Dutch colonialists still control the economic lifeline of Indonesia and extract the maximum profits.

    Dutch colonialists controlled Indonesia's financial affairs through three major banks; controlled Indonesia's import and export trade through five major foreign firms, and to a large extent manipulated the prices of Indonesian native products and consumer goods. Dutch shipping companies monopolized 70% of Indonesia's inter-island shipping; through more than 500 large plantations, they also controlled the production of important economic crops such as rubber, sugarcane, pepper, quinine, and tobacco in Indonesia. In addition, they also controlled important minerals such as tin mines, and monopolized Indonesia's oil production together with the United States and Britain.

    These well-organized, well-capitalized Dutch monopoly capital, protected by the colonial privileges stipulated in the Round Table Conference agreements, bound the development of Indonesia's national economy like a large net. Relying on their influence, Dutch colonialism often disrupted the economy, created difficulties, carried out subversive activities, and attacked Indonesian governments that pursued independent and autonomous policies that they did not like.

    According to Indonesian official statistics, Dutch investment in Indonesia is about 2.5 billion Dutch guilders. The Dutch Minister of Finance admitted that the Netherlands obtains about 1 billion Dutch guilders in profits from Indonesia every year (in addition, there are many profits that are secretly remitted out that people don't know about). Even if calculated using this number, the Indonesian people will have paid off all of the Netherlands' investments with their own blood and sweat in just two and a half years. In the more than ten years since Indonesian independence, Dutch colonialists have extracted profits from the Indonesian people that are several times greater than the total amount of their investment, not to mention that the Dutch capital was originally plundered from Indonesia. For three hundred and several decades, how much wealth they have plundered from the Indonesian people is impossible to calculate.

    Indonesia's financial situation has always been relatively difficult, and the government is worried about the annual fiscal deficit of more than 2 billion Indonesian rupiah (about 4 billion rupiah in 1957). However, a huge amount of wealth of 15 billion Indonesian rupiah is remitted out as profits by Dutch and other foreign colonialists every year, which is almost equal to the average annual expenditure of the Indonesian state.

    Dutch wealthy merchants, business owners, and senior employees living in Indonesia live a very luxurious life. Many of the most magnificent buildings, shops, gardens, and villas in Jakarta and many other Indonesian cities belong to them.

    Many Indonesian people can only live in small bamboo houses or sleep under the eaves of large companies. The homes of hundreds of thousands of workers are so simple and often lack water, which is unbearable in a place that is hot all year round. The homes of farmers near large plantations are being demolished in large numbers by bulldozers due to the greed of the plantation owners.

    The treatment of Indonesian workers working in Dutch enterprises is also very low. For example, Indonesian sailors working on Dutch ships only receive a basic salary of 120 rupiah per month, and only those with three or more children can receive 295 rupiah. The monthly salary of an Indonesian chief mate is only 400 rupiah, but the minimum living cost for one person is about 200 rupiah per month.

    Many sailors on Dutch ships spoke very angrily about the harsh treatment they received on the ships. They said that for a long period of time in the past, they could only eat rotten salted fish with rice, occasionally eat some boiled vegetables, and could only curl up in the bottom of the cabin to sleep at night, without beds, let alone the bolsters that Indonesians cannot do without when sleeping. Later, due to the struggle of the trade unions, the treatment was slightly improved, but compared with the Dutch working on the ships, the difference was still like heaven and earth.

    Truth and justice are on the side of the Indonesian people. Many Indonesians say that even if all Dutch enterprises in Indonesia are confiscated now, it will not be enough to compensate for the debt that the Netherlands owes to Indonesia.

    Even so, the Indonesian government and people still treat the Dutch with a very tolerant attitude. They stated that the status of Dutch enterprises can be further discussed after the West Irian issue is resolved, but the Dutch privileges in Indonesia must be abolished.

    Prime Minister Djuanda pointed out in a radio address that the purpose of opposing Dutch colonialism is to accelerate the recovery of West Irian, improve Indonesia's national economic life, and improve Indonesia's international status, giving freedom of action to the implementation of an independent and autonomous foreign policy. Therefore, Indonesia's struggle this time is a comprehensive patriotic movement to strive for territorial integrity and oppose colonialism.

    (III) Being Masters of Our Own House

    In this earth-shattering struggle, the Indonesian people showed their awareness, talent, and strength as masters of their own house.

    The story of Indonesian sailors taking over ships from the Dutch on the ocean is the most vivid evidence.

    Representatives of the workers on the "Balikpapan" ship, with a displacement of more than 3,600 tons, told reporters how they sailed this ship back to Jakarta.

    There were 63 Indonesian crew members and four Dutch people on this ship. It set sail from Surabaya to Cirebon on December 3. In the misty rain at sea, the sailors did not know what was happening on land that day. But the next day, the Dutch suddenly blocked the radio broadcast. At the same time, the person in charge of the ship's trade union discovered that the ship's course was not right. The sailors immediately felt that something major must have happened regarding the liberation of West Irian, and immediately held a meeting to discuss countermeasures. Near noon, it was the turn of the Indonesian second mate, Deng Dua, to watch the navigation tower; he quickly verified the nautical chart and confirmed that the ship was sailing towards Singapore. He told everyone about this situation, and the sailors immediately gathered to question the Dutch captain. The captain could not deny it and stuttered that he had received a secret telegram from the head office ordering him to sail the ship to Singapore. The crew members angrily demanded that the captain sail the ship back to an Indonesian port, but the Dutchman refused. So, the second mate, Deng Dua, with the help of other crew members, seized the steering wheel from the Dutch and changed the direction of the rudder. At this time, the Dutch captain also threatened him: "Deng Dua, what are you doing? You will be sued." But Deng Dua replied: "This is the matter of the Republic of Indonesia!"

    The Dutch also sneered, thinking that the Indonesian crew members would not be able to sail the ship back. It was not until they saw the Jakarta pier that the Dutch captain ingratiatingly said, "Can I help you drop anchor?" None of the Indonesian sailors paid attention to him. They had enough experience to handle everything. After going ashore, the crew members further confirmed that what they had done was right. It turned out that people on land had already launched a vigorous struggle to take over Dutch monopoly enterprises at this time.

    Similar struggles to protect ships also occurred on the seas of Palembang, Makassar, and Bali. Many Dutch ships were driven back to Indonesian ports by Indonesian crew members while they were trying to escape.

    Now, in many Dutch enterprises that have been officially taken over on land, control committees are being established one by one under the leadership of the government and military authorities. Military representatives, experts, and worker representatives participate in the control work. They jointly review the business plans and financial expenditures submitted by the Dutch managers, and supervise the normal operation of the enterprises.

    The workers are carrying out production in these enterprises with the attitude of masters. We have visited some Dutch enterprises that have been officially taken over, and the production of some enterprises is going even better than before the takeover.

    Through the introduction of worker representatives, we spoke with the Dutch manager of the Nimi Fu can factory in Jakarta, which has more than 300 workers. He admitted that since the factory was taken over, production has been going better than before, and there have been few or even no cases of workers being absent or late without reason. We also saw with our own eyes that the factory's offices and workshops were so clean and orderly everywhere. The Dutch manager is still sitting in his original manager's office, the difference being that the representative of the control committee is also sitting in the manager's office.

    The 18 Dutch senior employees of this factory, like the Dutch personnel of other enterprises, are still working in their original positions. Only individual Dutch people who sabotaged production or deliberately opposed the workers were dismissed or suspended.

    All of this confirms the heroic speech made by an Indonesian employee representative when taking over a Dutch enterprise. He said: "We want to prove to the Netherlands and to the whole world that we have the ability to be masters of our own house on our own land!"

      IV. Persevere in the Struggle

    Like all anti-colonial struggles, the Indonesian people inevitably encountered many obstacles and difficulties in the struggle. But their answer to difficulties is: "Never look back!"

    The Indonesian people's struggle was first subjected to the sabotage and interference of imperialism. At the beginning of this anti-Dutch struggle, countries such as the United States, Britain, and Australia put pressure on the Indonesian government, demanding that the Indonesian government take a "moderate" attitude towards the Netherlands. Indonesian public opinion believes that what is more worthy of vigilance is that imperialism is colluding with domestic reactionaries in Indonesia, attempting to stifle Indonesia's anti-colonial struggle from within. They are strengthening the activities of supporting armed bandits in Indonesia, trying to revive the "South Moluccas Republic" rebellion; and are continuing to instigate local separatism, planning to establish a "Sumatra State"; they are also creating assassinations and terrorist incidents to achieve the goal of subverting the Indonesian government that implements anti-colonial policies.

    At the same time, in this new major economic change of taking over Dutch enterprises, there have also been some temporary difficulties and economic imbalances, such as about 30% of export goods temporarily unable to find a market, some enterprises that have been taken over have encountered difficulties in the source and turnover of funds, and the temporary suspension of some maritime transportation has affected the exchange and supply of materials, making the residents of some islands face difficulties in lacking daily necessities.

    The leaders of the Indonesian government pointed out that temporary difficulties are unavoidable in the struggle against Dutch colonialism, and the government is actively trying to solve these problems, and has gradually solved some problems.

    The Indonesian people were not intimidated by the difficulties. With a hundred times more courage, they stepped into the new year of struggle with firm steps.

    President Sukarno said in his New Year's message that 1957 was a decisive year in Indonesia's anti-colonial struggle, and 1958 is the year to realize this decision, a year in which we must never look back. The Indonesian people must resolutely fight on!

    President Sukarno also pointed out that the Indonesian people's struggle is not isolated. Two billion people in the world support and sympathize with the Indonesian people and are ready to help them at any time. The Indonesian people believe that their just struggle will surely achieve final victory.

    印度尼西亚人民反对荷兰殖民者的斗争
    谢林风　沈定一
    （一）十二月的风暴
    1957年12月，印度尼西亚人民掀起了要求收复西伊里安的强大的群众运动，这个运动迅速漫卷了全国。
    斗争是从联合国拒绝通过印度尼西亚等十九国的提案后开始的。印度尼西亚人民这时再也忍不住长久压抑在心头的怒火。他们看到，在美国操纵下的联合国甚至连让印度尼西亚和荷兰直接谈判西伊里安问题的提案也通不过，要依靠联合国来收复西伊里安是不可能的了。
    正如苏加诺总统所说：“能决定西伊里安命运的不是联合国，而是印度尼西亚人民自己”。印度尼西亚人民决定以自己的力量，在联合国之外，用“其他途径”来解放西伊里安。他们迅速采取行动，向荷兰殖民主义者展开了英勇的斗争。
    12月2日，在政府领导下，全印度尼西亚荷兰企业中的印度尼西亚职工举行了总罢工，第二天，工人们展开了如火如荼的接管荷兰企业的运动。斗争锋芒一开始就指向荷兰的垄断企业，因为这是荷兰殖民主义的根子，是几百年来使印度尼西亚人民穷困落后的症结所在。
    雅加达的工人们首先接管了荷兰皇家轮船公司和五大洋行之一的玉美利洋行。接着，接管荷兰垄断企业的斗争就向全国各地展开。这时在全印度尼西亚的各个岛屿和海洋上，只要那里有荷兰的洋行、商店、工厂、船只和码头仓库，在那里的职工就组织了各种不同形式的接管委员会、财产监督小组或护厂队。他们开始接收荷兰企业，或者监督荷兰企业主的活动，防止企业遭受破坏。一个星期的时间内，工人们就接管了许多荷兰大企业，其中包括荷兰五大洋行、三大银行和荷兰皇家轮船公司的总机构，还有它们在各地的许多分、支机构以及不少大工厂和大商店。
    这是激动人心的一个星期。在雅加达，每天可以看到在荷兰企业的大楼前站满了情绪激昂的印度尼西亚职工。他们爬上高楼，降下荷兰的红白蓝三色旗，升起了印度尼西亚的红白国旗。他们把写着“印度尼西亚财产”的大红布挂在门前。戴着红袖章的印度尼西亚职工庄严地在一些荷兰大银行和大洋行的门口站岗，防止荷兰资本家和他们的走狗把重要文件和财产偷盗出去。
    印度尼西亚工人代表走进了在这些高楼大厦里面的经理室，向荷兰经理们宣读“接管宣言”，命令他们交出钥匙和账册。
    在这场轰轰烈烈的反荷斗争中，印度尼西亚的人民和政府显示了团结的力量。各种不同倾向的工会一致行动，互相配合，并遵守政府和军事当局的规定。政府也支持了群众的行动，在工人接管荷兰皇家轮船公司以后两天，印度尼西亚内阁就举行会议，追认了群众的接管行动，政府和军事当局作出了一系列的重要决定：宣布管制全部荷兰企业（荷兰和其他国家合营的石油企业除外）和荷兰种植园，封闭在全国各地的荷兰领事馆，命令无职业的荷兰侨民离境，冻结荷兰企业的全部利润转汇，禁止荷文报刊在印度尼西亚出版发行，并禁止荷兰航空公司的飞机在印度尼西亚着陆。政府的这些决定从根本上打击了荷兰殖民主义在印度尼西亚的垄断地位，这也是实现全国人民长久盼望的废除圆桌会议协定的行动。
    印度尼西亚人民和政府向全世界显示了他们的力量和他们收复西伊里安、消灭殖民主义的决心！
      （二）荷兰殖民者的掠夺
    印度尼西亚人民目前进行的反荷斗争，其意义不只是要求收回西伊里安，而是1945年印度尼西亚独立革命的继续，是为了印度尼西亚在政治上和经济上取得完全的独立。
    自从1945年印度尼西亚宣布独立以来，由于圆桌会议协定的签订（这个协定虽然在前年被印度尼西亚宣布废除了，但还没有具体执行废除的各种措施），荷兰殖民主义者仍然控制着印度尼西亚的经济命脉，榨取着最高限度的利润。
    荷兰殖民主义者通过三大银行操纵了印度尼西亚的财政金融；通过五大洋行控制了印度尼西亚的出入口贸易，并在很大程度上操纵了印度尼西亚土产品和消费品的价格，荷兰的轮船公司垄断了70％的印度尼西亚岛际航运；通过五百多个大种植园，他们又控制了印度尼西亚的橡胶、甘蔗、胡椒、金鸡纳霜、烟草等重要经济作物的生产。此外，他们还控制了锡矿等重要矿产，并同美英一起垄断了印度尼西亚的石油生产。
    这些组织严密的、资本雄厚的，并且还有圆桌会议协定所规定的殖民主义特权所保护的荷兰垄断资本，像一张大网一样束缚住了印度尼西亚民族经济的发展。荷兰殖民主义凭借他们的影响，还常常扰乱经济、制造困难，进行颠覆活动，打击他们所不喜欢的执行独立自主政策的印度尼西亚政府。
    据印度尼西亚官方的统计，荷兰在印度尼西亚的投资额约为二十五亿多荷盾。荷兰财政部长承认，荷兰每年从印度尼西亚获得的利润约为十亿荷盾（此外，还有许多人们所不知道的偷汇出去的利润。）即使以这个数目来计算一下，只要二年半时间，印度尼西亚人民就以自己的血汗付清了荷兰的全部投资。印度尼西亚独立十几年来，荷兰殖民主义者已从印度尼西亚人民身上榨取了超过数倍于他们投资总额的利润，何况荷兰的资金原就是从印度尼西亚掠夺的。三百几十年来，他们究竟掠夺了印度尼西亚人民多少财富，这笔账是无法算清的了。
    印度尼西亚的财政情况一直比较困难，政府每年都为二十几亿印度尼西亚盾的财政赤字（1957年约为四十亿盾）着急。但是每年却有一百五十亿印度尼西亚盾的巨大财富，被荷兰和其他外国殖民主义者作为利润转汇出去，这个数目几乎等于印度尼西亚国家每年的平均支出。
    在印度尼西亚居住的荷兰富商、企业主以及高级职员们过着非常奢侈的生活。雅加达和其他许多印度尼西亚城市的最富丽堂皇的大厦、商店和花园、别墅，很多都是他们的。
    许多印度尼西亚人民只能栖居在矮小的竹屋或者露宿在大公司的屋檐下。成千上万的工人住宅是那样简陋，而且经常缺水，这在终年炎热的地方是难以忍受的。在大种植园附近的农民住屋，由于种植园主的贪得无厌而大批的被推土机推倒。
    在荷兰企业里工作的印度尼西亚工人们，待遇也非常低。如在荷兰船上工作的印度尼西亚水手，每月只有一百二十盾的基本薪水，有三个儿女以上才能领到二百九十五盾。印度尼西亚籍大副的每月工资也不过四百几十盾，但一个人每月最低的生活费用要二百盾左右。
    荷兰船上的许多水手，非常愤慨地谈起他们在船上的恶劣待遇。他们说，在过去的一个长时期里，他们只能吃到烂咸鱼拌饭，偶而吃些白水煮青菜，晚上只能卷缩在舱底睡觉，没有床铺，更没有印度尼西亚人睡觉时所不可缺少的抱枕。后来因为工会的斗争，待遇稍为改善一些，但跟船上工作的荷兰人比较，其差别仍是天上地下。
    真理和正义是在印度尼西亚人民方面，许多印度尼西亚人说，即使现在把所有在印度尼西亚的荷兰企业予以没收，也还不能抵偿荷兰对印度尼西亚欠下的债。
    虽然如此，印度尼西亚政府和人民还是以非常宽容的态度来对待荷兰人。他们表示，荷兰企业的地位在西伊里安问题解决后，还可进一步的讨论，但是荷兰在印度尼西亚的特权必须取消。
    朱安达总理在一次广播演说中指出，反对荷兰殖民主义的目的是为了加速收复西伊里安，改善印度尼西亚的民族经济生活和改善印度尼西亚在国际上的地位，给予执行独立自主的外交政策以活动的自由。因此，印度尼西亚这次的斗争是一个全面的争取领土主权完整、反对殖民主义的爱国运动。
    （三）当家做主
    在这场惊天动地的斗争中，印度尼西亚人民显示了他们的当家做主的觉悟、才能和力量。
    印度尼西亚海员工人在海洋上从荷兰人手中接管船只的故事，是最生动的证据。
    排水量三千六百多吨的“巴里巴板”号船上的工人代表曾向记者讲述了他们怎样把这条船开回雅加达的经过。
    这只船上有六十三个印度尼西亚船员，四个荷兰人。它在12月3日从泗水开航去井里汶，在海上的蒙蒙雨中，水手们还不知道这一天陆上发生了什么事情。但第二天，荷兰人忽然封锁无线电广播。同时，船上工会的负责人又发觉船的航驶方向不对头。水手们马上感到一定发生了有关解放西伊里安的重大事情了，立刻举行会议，商量对策。快到中午时分，轮到印度尼西亚籍的二副登杜阿守望驾驶塔；他就赶紧对证海图，证实船正向新加坡航行。他把这个情况告诉了大家，水手们立刻集合起来质问荷兰船长，船长抵赖不过，才吞吞吐吐地承认了他接到总公司的密电，要他把船开到新加坡去。船员们愤怒要船长把船开回印度尼西亚港口，但是这个荷兰人拒绝了，于是二副登杜阿在其他船员的帮助下，从荷兰人手中夺取了驾驶盘，改变了船舵的方向。这时，荷兰船长还吓唬他：“登杜阿，你干什么？你会吃官司的。”可是登杜阿回答他说：“这是印度尼西亚共和国的事！”
    荷兰人还轻视地哼着鼻子，以为印度尼西亚船员无法把船开回来，一直到看见了雅加达的码头，荷兰船长才讨好地说：“我可以帮助你们抛锚吗？”印度尼西亚水手谁也不睬他，他们有足够的经验料理一切。上岸后，船员们进一步证实了他们做的对，原来陆上的人们已在这个时候发动了接管荷兰垄断企业的轰轰烈烈的斗争。
    类似的保护船只的斗争也在巨港、望加锡、巴厘的海面上发生过。许多荷兰船只都在逃跑的途中由印度尼西亚船员驾驶回印度尼西亚的港口。
    现在在陆地上被正式接管的许多荷兰企业中，在政府和军事当局的领导下，正在逐个成立管制委员会。军事代表、专家和工人代表参加了管制工作，他们共同审核荷兰经理呈报的业务计划、财政开支等，监督着企业业务的正常进行。
    工人们在这些企业中以主人翁的态度进行着生产。我们曾参观了一些被正式接管的荷兰企业，有些企业的生产比接管前还进行得好。
    通过工人代表的介绍，我们曾和一个有三百多工人的雅加达尼米夫制罐厂的荷兰经理谈过话。他承认，这个工厂自从被接管后，生产比以前进行得好了，工人们很少甚至已没有无故旷工或迟到的现象了。我们也亲眼看见了这个厂的办公室和车间到处是那样整洁和有条不紊。这位荷兰经理如今仍坐在他原来的经理室办公，不同的是经理室里也坐上了管制委员会的代表。
    这个厂的十八个荷兰籍高级职员和其他企业的荷兰人员一样仍留在原来岗位上工作，只有个别的因为破坏生产或者故意和工人作对的荷兰人才被解职或停职。
    这一切，证实了一个印度尼西亚职工代表在接管荷兰企业时发表的豪迈的讲话，他说：“我们要向荷兰、向全世界证实，我们有能力在我们自己的土地上当家做主！”
      四、把斗争坚持下去
    像所有的反殖民主义斗争一样，印度尼西亚人民在斗争中也不可免地碰到了不少阻力和困难。但是他们对困难的回答是：“决不回头！”
    印度尼西亚人民的斗争首先遭到了帝国主义的破坏和干涉，美、英、澳等国在这个反荷斗争一开始就向印度尼西亚政府施加压力，要印度尼西亚政府对荷兰采取“温和”态度。印度尼西亚舆论认为，更值得警惕的是帝国主义正在和印度尼西亚国内的反动派勾结起来，企图从内部来扼杀印度尼西亚的反殖民主义斗争。他们正在加强扶植印度尼西亚国内武装匪徒的活动，想复活“南摩鹿加共和国”的反叛运动；并正在继续鼓动地方分裂主义，策划成立“苏门答腊国”；他们并制造暗杀和恐怖事件，以达到颠覆执行反殖民主义政策的印度尼西亚政府的目的。
    同时，在接管荷兰企业这个经济上的新的大变动中，也发生了一些暂时的困难和经济上的不协调现象，如30％左右的出口物资暂时找不到市场，被接管的一些企业资金来源和周转也遇到了困难，而部分海上交通的暂时停顿，影响了物资的交流和供应，使有些岛上的居民面临缺乏日用品的困难。
    印度尼西亚政府的领导人指出，在反对荷兰殖民主义的斗争中发生暂时的困难是不可免的，政府正在积极设法解决这些问题，而且也逐步解决了一些问题。
    印度尼西亚人民没有被困难吓倒，他们勇气百倍地跨着坚定的步伐，踏进了新的斗争的一年。
    苏加诺总统在新年祝词中说，1957年是印度尼西亚反殖民主义斗争的有决定性的一年，1958年是实现这个决定的一年，是决不能回头的一年，印度尼西亚人们要坚决斗争下去！
    苏加诺总统也曾指出，印度尼西亚人民的斗争不是孤立的，世界上有二十亿人民支持和同情印度尼西亚人民，并且随时准备援助他们。印度尼西亚人民相信他们的正义斗争一定会得到最后胜利。
