Due to the shortage of sugar supply in recent years, the supply has been quite tight. The tension in sugar supply was even more prominent last year. Although all parts of the country have adopted methods such as controlling supply, rationing, supplying with vouchers, and controlling sales, there are still stockouts. The sugar needed for food industry processing has also been repeatedly compressed, causing great difficulties in production arrangements. The supply of sugar in Gansu Province is even tighter. In 1957, the province supplied a total of more than 8,000 tons of sugar (excluding more than 5 million catties of biscuits and fruit candies purchased from other places), with an average of just over one catty per person. In 1958, the province plans to supply 8,500 tons of sugar. Although the actual supply has increased slightly, the supply is actually lower because it is impossible to purchase fruit candies and biscuits from other places, and the population continues to increase.

The tight supply of sugar is mainly due to the fact that production growth cannot keep up with consumption growth. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the state tried to expand the area of sugar crops, invested 380 million yuan in the sugar industry, built and renovated more than 80 large, medium and small sugar factories, and increased the annual sugar production capacity by 650,000 tons. It is estimated that 870,000 tons of sugar will be produced in 1957, an increase of 93% compared with 1952, but there is still a big gap from the original target of 1.1 million tons. However, social consumption has increased with the improvement of people's lives, an increase of 102% in 1957 compared with 1952. Because production cannot meet the needs of consumption, a considerable amount of sugar must be imported every year.

In order to solve the current tight supply situation, it is necessary to actively develop sugar crops and vigorously increase sugar production.

From the current situation of domestic sugar production, it mainly relies on Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Yunnan, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia to supply raw materials, of which Guangdong and Heilongjiang provinces account for 60% of the country's total output. If the planting area of sugar crops is greatly increased in these two provinces, it will affect the task of the local people's rations and the outward transfer of grain. In recent years, the part increased by the main producing areas every year can only increase the supply of the province, and it is impossible to transfer more quantities to other places. Moreover, sugarcane and sugar beet have a long production period and are prone to varying degrees of natural disasters. The disaster and production reduction in Guangdong and Heilongjiang in the past two years have affected the national supply.

In order to meet the increasing needs of the people, we should change the current situation that 640 million people eat sugar relying solely on the supply of eight producing areas. In addition to consolidating and expanding the original bases, new bases should also be established in areas with suitable conditions for sugar production.

Gansu (including the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region) has the conditions to develop into a new base for sugar beet production. First, Gansu has changed from a grain-deficient area in history to a surplus grain area, and there are more than 20 million mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed. Second, the natural conditions in Gansu are very suitable for growing sugar beets, especially in the Hexi Corridor and the vast areas of Yinchuan. The average yield of sugar beets planted per mu is 6,000 catties, and the high-yield land reaches 10,000 catties, with an average sugar content of more than 18%. The yield per unit area is twice as high as that of Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, and twice as high as that of the Soviet Union. Developing the sugar industry here can save a lot of land. Third, the local people have a history of planting sugar beets and making sugar by indigenous methods for more than ten years, and the processed red and white sugar are of good quality.

Now the party and government leaders of Gansu Province have begun to attach importance to the development of sugar production. The province plans to plant 20,500 mu of sugar beets this year, and decided to open a short-term training class in Wuwei in January this year to exchange experience in planting sugar beets and indigenous sugar making. At the same time, it is planned to build two mechanized sugar factories in Wuwei and Yinchuan that can process 1,500 tons of sugar beets per day.

We believe that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, we should vigorously develop sugar beet production and the sugar industry in Gansu (including the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region). If 2 million mu of sugar beets can be planted by 1962, calculated at an average yield of 6,000 catties per mu and a sugar extraction rate of 14%, 840,000 tons of sugar can be produced annually. Sugar beet leaves, green tops, and waste silk can feed 3.3 million cattle or 4.9 million pigs. Pig and cattle manure fertilizer and filter mud can also increase grain production. 270,000 tons of by-product molasses can be used to brew 98,000 tons of 65-proof white wine. This is of great benefit to supporting the needs of sugar in the country, accumulating funds for the country, and developing agriculture and animal husbandry and prospering the local economy in Gansu.

    甘肃是发展甜菜糖生产的好基地
    甘肃省城市服务厅副厅长　高伯祥
    城市服务部糖业糕点商业局副局长　樊陶斋
    几年来由于食糖的货源不足，供应相当紧张。去年食糖供应的紧张程度更突出。虽然全国各地采取了控制供应、定量供应、凭证供应、掌握出售等方法，但仍然发生脱销现象。对食品工业加工需要的食糖也一再压缩，使生产安排遭受很大的困难。甘肃省食糖的供应更紧张。1957年全省共供应了八千多吨糖（不包括从外地买进的五百多万斤饼干和水果糖），平均每人只能买到一斤多。1958年计划全省供应食糖八千五百吨，实际供应量虽略有增加，但由于不可能向外地购进水果糖、饼干，加上人口继续增加，供应量实际上是降低了。
    食糖供应紧张，主要是由于生产的增长跟不上消费的增长。第一个五年计划期间，国家设法扩大了糖料作物的面积，给制糖工业投资三亿八千万元，新建和改建大中小糖厂八十多个，增加年产糖能力六十五万吨。1957年预计生产食糖八十七万吨，比1952年增长93％，但是和原订生产一百一十万吨的指标还有很大的距离。而社会消费量却随着人民生活的改善而提高，1957年比1952年增长了102％。由于生产不能满足消费的需要，每年要进口相当数量的食糖。
    为了解决目前供应紧张的状况，必须积极发展糖料作物，大力增产食糖。
    从国内食糖生产的现状来看，主要是依靠广东、广西、福建、四川、云南、黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古几个产区供应原料，其中广东、黑龙江两省的产量就占全国产量的60％。如果再在这两省大量增加糖料作物的耕种面积，就会影响当地人民的口粮及外调粮食的任务。近几年来主要产区每年增产的部分，只能增加本省供应，不可能有较多数量外调，而且甘蔗、甜菜生产期较长，容易遭受不同程度的自然灾害。广东、黑龙江近二年受灾减产，就影响了全国的供应。
    为了适应人民日益增长的需要，应该改变目前六亿四千万人吃糖仅仅依靠八个产区供应的状况。对食糖生产，除了巩固扩大原有的基地外，还要在有条件的地区建立新基地。
    甘肃（包括宁夏回族自治区），是很有条件发展成为甜菜糖生产的新基地的。第一、甘肃已经从历史上的缺粮地区改变为余粮地区，并且有二千多万亩荒地可以开垦。第二、甘肃的自然条件很适合种植甜菜，特别是河西走廊及银川的广大地区，种植的甜菜每亩平均产六千斤，丰产地达一万斤，含糖率平均在18％以上。单位面积产量比黑龙江、内蒙古高二倍，比苏联也高一倍，在这里发展制糖工业，能节约大量土地。第三、当地群众种植甜菜和用土法制糖已有十几年历史，加工出来的红、白糖，质量良好。
    现在甘肃省党政领导已开始重视发展食糖生产，计划全省今年种植甜菜二万零五百亩，并决定今年1月在武威开办一个短期训练班，交流种植甜菜及土法制糖的经验；同时计划在武威、银川筹建两个每日可以处理一千五百吨甜菜的机制糖厂。
    我们认为，在第二个五年计划期内，应该大力发展甘肃（包括宁夏回族自治区）的甜菜生产及制糖工业。如果到1962年能种植甜菜二百万亩，按每亩平均产量六千市斤、出糖率14％计算，每年可产糖八十四万吨。甜菜叶、青头、废丝可喂牛三百三十万头或猪四百九十万头。猪、牛粪肥及滤泥又能增产粮食。副产品糖蜜二十七万吨，可酿九万八千吨六十五度的白酒。这对支援全国食糖的需要，为国家积累资金，和对发展甘肃农牧业、繁荣地方经济，都有很大的好处。
