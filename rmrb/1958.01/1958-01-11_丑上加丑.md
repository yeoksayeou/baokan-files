    Ugliness Compounded by Ugliness
    Hagen, the person in charge of the American "Vanguard" satellite program, solemnly announced that the Russians had very likely test-launched a rocket to the moon, but it was unsuccessful. Then he made a conclusion: this shows that the Russians have encountered difficulties in rockets.
    Did the Soviet Union conduct such a test launch? No. Even Hagen himself admits that there is "no evidence." However, despite the absence of evidence, Hagen still talks about the "failure" of the "Soviet Satellite III" as if it were true.
    The American satellite made a big fool of itself more than a month ago. It is understandable that Hagen, as the person in charge, wants to cover up this matter; however, using the means of fabricating the "failure" of others to cover up one's own failure is ugliness compounded by ugliness.

    丑上加丑
    美国“先锋”卫星计划负责人哈根郑重其事地宣布说，俄国人很可能已经向月亮试射一个火箭，但是没有成功。接着他下了一个论断：这表明俄国人在火箭方面遇到了困难。
    究竟苏联进行了这样的试射没有呢？没有。连哈根自己都承认“毫无证据”。然而，尽管查无其事，哈根仍然像煞有介事地大谈其“苏联卫星第三号”的“失败”。
    美国卫星在一个多月以前大出洋相，作为负责人的哈根要替这件事遮丑，这种心情是可以理解的；然而以捏造别人的“失败”的手段来为自己的失败遮丑，却是丑上加丑了。
