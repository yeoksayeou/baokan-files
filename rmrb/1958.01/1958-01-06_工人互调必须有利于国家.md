    Worker Transfers Must Benefit the Nation
    Comrade Fu Renzhen's suggestion that "workers from the North and South be transferred back home to work" (see page 3 of this newspaper on December 1st) cannot be universally implemented, in my opinion. Just imagine, Shanghai workers logging in the Greater Khingan Mountains, if transferred to work in East China, would indeed be closer to home, and the travel expenses for visiting relatives would be less. However, would there be work in their original profession if they were transferred to East China? And who would cut the timber in the Greater Khingan Mountains? What would workers from the Southwest working in Baotou and Anshan do after returning to their hometowns? Who would then undertake the construction work in Anshan and Baotou Iron and Steel? Would we recruit from nearby rural areas or cities again? Although not absolutely impossible, how much time would it take to train them into skilled workers? Moving one part affects the whole situation, which is detrimental to the cause of socialist construction. Therefore, I suggest that workers in the North and South should only be transferred back to their hometowns if there is a possibility of mutual transfer and if it truly benefits both the country and the individual.

### 工人互调必须有利于国家

    工人互调必须有利于国家
    甫仁珍同志建议“南北方工人互调回家工作”（见12月1日本报三版），我觉得这个建议不能普遍执行。试想，在大兴安岭伐木的上海工人，调到华东工作，离家固然近了一些，回家探亲的路费也可少花一点，但调到华东来有没有原行业的工做呢？大兴安岭的木材又由谁去砍伐呢？在包头、鞍钢工作的大西南的工人，回家乡后又作什么呢？鞍钢、包钢的建设工作又由谁去担负呢？再由附近农村或城市招收吗？虽然并非绝对不可，但要多少时间才能把他们培养成业务熟练的工人呢？甩一发而动全身，这对社会主义建设事业是不利的。因此，我建议：在南北方工作的职工，只有在有对调的可能并确有利于国家又有利于个人的情况下，才互调回乡工作。
