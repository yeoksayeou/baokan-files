Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 11th: Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, wrote to the International Commission on January 7, denouncing the South Vietnamese authorities for denying the interference activities carried out by the US Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) in South Vietnam.

On November 14, 1957, the International Commission issued a public letter, accompanied by correspondence exchanged between the International Commission and the South Vietnamese authorities on the MAAG issue. In his letter to the International Commission after receiving the aforementioned public letter and attachments, Ha Van Lau reiterated the establishment of MAAG and its activities in South Vietnam, pointing out its aggressive nature. In September 1954, the United States and France placed South Vietnam under the protection of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. In February 1955, the South Vietnamese authorities and France agreed that the United States would directly take charge of the construction of the South Vietnamese army, and the task of organizing and training the South Vietnamese army was handed over to MAAG. Subsequently, the number of MAAG personnel increased from over a hundred to over a thousand. Various military organizations of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force, such as the "Training, Organization, and Inspection Team," "Combat, Weapons, and Training Organization," and "Joint Logistics Office," were successively established in South Vietnam.

It is pointed out that MAAG is currently undertaking the following tasks in South Vietnam: determining the total number of branches, ordnance, and reserves of the South Vietnamese army according to the intentions of the US government; training the South Vietnamese army according to the plans of the US military staff authorities; deciding, organizing, and inspecting US military aid in South Vietnam; directing various military activities in South Vietnam; and commanding the construction of strategic airports, ports, highways and other facilities in South Vietnam.

In his letter, Ha Van Lau emphasized that the existence of MAAG and the expansion of its activities are part of the US interference in Vietnam's internal affairs and its conspiracy with the South Vietnamese authorities to undermine the peace and unity of Vietnam. These activities of the United States clearly demonstrate that the United States is infringing upon Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and completely violating the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

    美国控制南越军事并干涉越南内政
    越方斥美国破坏日内瓦协议
    据新华社河内11日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼在1月7日写信给国际委员会，斥责南越当局抵赖美国军事援助顾问团在南越所进行的干涉活动。
    1957年11月14日，国际委员会曾经发出一项公函，并且随函附有国际委员会和南越当局之间就美国军事援助顾问团问题所交换的来往信件。何文楼在他接到上述公函和附件以后写给国际委员会的这封信件中，再次说明美国军事援助顾问团的成立和在南越进行的活动，指出了它的侵略性质。1954年9月，美国和法国把南越划归东南亚军事集团的保护之下。1955年2月，南越当局和法国同意美国直接掌握南越军队的建军工作，并且把组织和训练南越军队的工作交给美国军事援助顾问团。其后，美国军事援助顾问团的人数从一百多人增加到一千多人。美国海陆空军的各种军事组织，如“训练、组织、视察团”、“战斗、武器、训练组织”、“联合后勤处”等，都先后在南越建立起来。
    据指出，美国军事援助顾问团目前在南越担负这样的任务：根据美国政府的意图，决定南越军队的兵种、军需和后备力量的总人数；按照美国军事参谋当局的计划来训练南越军队；决定、组织和检查美国在南越的军事援助；指导南越的各种军事活动；指挥南越的战略机场、港口、公路等设施的建设工作。
    何文楼在信中强调指出，美国军事援助顾问团的存在和它的活动的扩大，是美国干涉越南的内政以及同南越当局一起破坏越南的和平和统一的阴谋的一部分。美国的这种活动清楚地证明了美国侵犯越南的独立主权和领土的完整，完全违反了日内瓦协议的规定。
