Funeral Allowance Standard Should Be Unified

The draft of the Provisional Regulations on Retirement Treatment for Workers and Staff stipulates, "After a retired person passes away, a funeral allowance equivalent to two to three months of their total retirement pension will be issued." I believe this regulation is somewhat unreasonable. Currently, there are some wage differences between employees in enterprises and government offices. It is entirely appropriate for employees to receive retirement pensions according to their length of service and standard during retirement. However, after a retired person passes away, the funeral allowance does not necessarily have to be issued based on two to three months of their original retirement pension. Instead, a general standard could be stipulated, allowing for flexible control within a certain monetary range. Because all people are equal, the funerals of retired personnel should be handled according to the principle of thrift.

    丧葬补助费标准应统一
    工人、职员退休处理暂行规定草案中规定“退休人员去世以后，一次发给相当于本人二至三个月的退休费总额的丧葬补助费”，我认为这样的规定有些不大合理。目前企业、机关职工的工资有些差距，职工在退休期间，按工龄长短按标准领取退休费是完全应该的。但在退休人员去世后丧葬补助费就不一定仍按本人原来的退休费发二至三个月了，而可以规定一个总的标准，可在多少钱范围内灵活掌握。因为人是没有贵贱之分的，退休人员的丧葬都应按节约的原则办理。
