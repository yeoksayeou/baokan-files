    Factory Construction Should Avoid Large-Scale Demolition of Civilian Housing
    Yantai is one of China's famous fishing ports. Since liberation, its fish products have been sold throughout the country, but its current production capacity is far from meeting the needs of the people. Therefore, the state has allocated 25 million yuan to expand this fishing port, so that it can better support the country's socialist construction.
  However, recently, various units received a notice from the Yantai Municipal Fishery Base Construction Committee, which stated: "Our city plans to establish a joint processing plant north of Beima Road, south of Haibin Street, east of the Southwest River, and west of Dezeng Hutong, starting from January 1958. The Municipal People's Committee has instructed our committee to formulate a plan for the demolition and relocation of houses within this area, which will be arranged uniformly soon. All units and residents within this area must immediately stop all construction activities, large and small, and stop moving in." We do not understand why the government decided to build a joint processing plant in a densely populated area? In this area, there are offices, factories, residents, houses, and shops. If we are to "demolish houses" and "arrange uniformly," then thousands of households will have to relocate, and tens of thousands of houses will have to be demolished. This will not only cause losses to the country, but also create a housing panic. Furthermore, the joint processing plant includes a fishmeal factory. The fishmeal factory will emit a very strong odor. The current factory site is located at the southern end of the city center, so Yantai will be immersed in this odor all year round.
    Is there no other suitable place to build a factory besides the above area? No. To the west of Yantai Port there is a vast area, not far from the city center, without many houses, and it is relatively easy to build a harbor (because of the shallow-water wharf).
    We believe that demolishing thousands of houses and relocating many residents at once in order to build a factory violates the Party's policy of building the country with diligence and thrift. We hope that the relevant departments will re-examine the matter and proceed with caution.

### 修建工厂应避免大量拆除民房

    修建工厂应避免大量拆除民房
    烟台是我国有名的渔港之一。解放后，它出产的渔类运销全国各地，按现有的生产能力还远远不能满足人民生活的需要。所以国家拨了二千五百万元巨款来扩建这个渔港，使它更好地支援国家的社会主义建设。
  但是，最近各单位接到了烟台市渔业基地建设委员会的一份通知，内容是：“我市拟自1958年1月起在北马路以北、海宾街以南、西南河以东、德增胡同以西，建立联合加工厂，市人委责成我委正在制定该范围内拆迁房屋的方案，不久即将统一安排。凡在该范围内的单位和住户立即停止一切大小修建活动和停止迁入等。”我们不明白为什么政府决定在人口居住稠密的地区建立联合加工厂？在这地区内有机关、工厂、居民、房屋、商店，如果要“拆迁房屋”“统一安排”，那么将有数千户居民迁移，数万间房屋要拆除。这不仅会造成国家的损失，并且还会造成房屋恐慌。再说，联合加工厂中包括渔粉厂。渔粉厂会发出很大臭味。现在选择的厂址在市中心的南端，这样，烟台就会整年浸沉在这种臭味中。
    是不是除了以上地区就再没有适合的建厂地方了呢？不是的。在烟台港的西面有着广阔的地方，距市中心也不远，没有很多的房子，修建港湾也比较容易（因为浅水码头）。
    我们认为，为了建设一个工厂，一下子要拆除成千的住房，迁移许多居民，是违反党提出的勤俭建国的方针的，希望有关部门重新研究，慎重从事。
