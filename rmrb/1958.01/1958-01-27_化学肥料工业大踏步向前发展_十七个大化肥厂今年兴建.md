Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch: China's chemical fertilizer industry, which is closely related to increasing agricultural output, is about to begin a great leap forward. This year, seventeen chemical fertilizer plants above the quota will be under construction nationwide, in addition to a phosphate mine supplying raw materials for phosphate fertilizer plants. Once these seventeen chemical fertilizer plants are completed and put into production, they will be able to produce 1,680,800 tons of nitrogen fertilizer (converted to ammonium sulfate), 800,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, and 100,000 tons of calcium cyanamide fertilizer annually. This year, the national investment in chemical fertilizer industry construction has doubled compared to last year, nearly equaling the total investment for the four years from 1953 to 1956.

	Such a large-scale construction of the chemical fertilizer industry is unprecedented in China's history. In 1949, China's annual output of ammonium sulfate was only 27,000 tons, and there was no phosphate fertilizer industry at all.

	Among these seventeen chemical fertilizer plants, seven are being built by the central government, including the Jilin Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant (Phase II), Lanzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, Sichuan Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, Taiyuan Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, Dalian Chemical Plant (expansion), Yongli Ning Plant (expansion), and Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant. The ten being built by local governments include the Zhejiang, Hunan, and Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plants, the Zhanjiang and Shanxi Phosphate Fertilizer Plants, and five calcium cyanamide fertilizer plants in Anhui, Sichuan, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi. The Yongli Ning Plant and Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant are expected to be completed this year. A set of nitrogen fertilizer projects at the Lanzhou and Sichuan Nitrogen Fertilizer Plants can also be basically completed this year. The newly added production capacity this year will be 188,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer (converted to ammonium sulfate) and 400,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer. The Jinping Phosphate Mine in Jiangsu, with an annual output of 300,000 tons of phosphate rock powder, is also scheduled for completion this year.

	In view of the particularly heavy construction tasks of the chemical fertilizer industry this year, the urgent need for progress, and the even more arduous construction tasks in the years to come, taking all effective measures to ensure the completion of this year's construction tasks and creating conditions to promote the rapid development of the chemical fertilizer industry in the future has become a very important issue at present.

	How to accelerate the construction speed while ensuring quality is one of the major issues that the Ministry of Chemical Industry has been studying frequently recently. After in-depth research, the ministry affirmed that the three-dimensional cross-parallel assembly line construction method, which has already achieved good experience in the construction of the Jilin Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, is the most effective method to shorten the construction period and is suitable for the construction characteristics of the nitrogen fertilizer industry. The architectural characteristics of chemical fertilizer plants are that there are many high-rise buildings, with the highest buildings reaching 35 or 6 meters. If the old construction method is used, the construction period will be very long if the machine installation is carried out after the plant building is completed. In the first five-year plan, it originally took about three years for a nitrogen fertilizer plant from the start of construction to being put into production. In the later stage of construction of the Jilin Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, the construction task was completed half a year ahead of schedule by adopting the three-dimensional cross-parallel assembly line construction method of civil construction and installation. The Ministry of Chemical Industry has decided to vigorously promote this advanced construction method this year and believes that it is entirely possible to shorten the construction period of a nitrogen fertilizer plant by one-third as long as all aspects of work are strengthened. The Taiyuan Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, which is about to start construction this year, has proposed to complete the construction of the plant within two years.

	After research, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has taken many conservation measures, saving where possible and simplifying where possible without affecting normal production, which greatly reduces construction costs. Building a new nitrogen fertilizer plant will save 40% of investment compared to the Jilin Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant.

	Actively training technical personnel, especially various technical backbones and special types of work required for the construction of the chemical fertilizer industry, such as high-pressure fitters, high-pressure pipe workers, senior welders, anti-corrosion workers, meter workers, etc., has a decisive impact on the construction speed of the chemical fertilizer industry. The Ministry of Chemical Industry has put forward a plan and demanded that this work be started immediately. In order to solve the problem of technical backbones for the construction of fertilizer plants in various provinces and cities, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangsu, Hebei and Shandong provinces have sent more than 300 people to the construction sites of Lanzhou and Jilin Nitrogen Fertilizer Plants, where the Ministry of Chemical Industry helps to train them.

	Several nitrogen fertilizer plants newly built locally this year can only start construction after the domestic drawings are designed. If a set of designs is made for each plant as in the past, it is impossible for the nitrogen fertilizer design institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry to complete this task now. The rapid and effective measure taken by the Ministry of Chemical Industry is to do a standardized design. The nitrogen fertilizer design institute of the ministry concentrated more than 200 engineers and technicians and has been working intensively on the standardized design of the nitrogen fertilizer plant since October last year. The original plan was to complete the drawings by the end of June this year, but now it seems that it can be completed by the end of May.

	Except for the Lanzhou and Taiyuan Nitrogen Fertilizer Plants, which are supplied with main equipment by the Soviet Union, and the Sichuan Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, which is supplied with equipment by Czechoslovakia, the equipment for other newly built and expanded fertilizer plants this year and fertilizer plants to be built in the future will all be manufactured by China itself. Ensuring the timely completion of the manufacturing tasks of these equipments is also one of the main keys to ensuring the completion of the construction tasks of the chemical fertilizer industry. The machine manufacturing industry department has done a lot of work in this regard and has been paying close attention to it. Recently, a special team will be sent to relevant factories in Northeast China to inspect the progress of equipment manufacturing.

    化学肥料工业大踏步向前发展
    十七个大化肥厂今年兴建
    新华社26日讯　对提高农业产量有密切关系的我国化学肥料工业，将要开始大踏步向前发展。今年全国进行建设的限额以上的化学肥料厂有十七个，另外，还有一个供磷肥厂原料的磷矿。这十七个化学肥料厂全部建成投入生产后，每年可以生产氮肥（折成硫铵）一百六十八万零八千吨，磷肥八十万吨，石灰氮肥十万吨。今年，全国化学肥料工业建设的投资比去年增长了一倍，将近等于1953到1956年四年投资的总和。
    化学肥料工业这样巨大规模的建设，在我国历史上是空前的。1949年，我国硫铵的年产量才二万七千吨，磷肥工业根本没有。
    这十七个化学肥料厂中，由中央建设的有吉林氮肥厂（二期）、兰州氮肥厂、四川氮肥厂、太原氮肥厂、大连化工厂（扩建）、永利宁厂（扩建）和南京磷肥厂等七个；由地方建设的十个，其中有浙江、湖南和广州三个氮肥厂，湛江和山西两个磷肥厂，另外还有安徽、四川、福建、浙江和江西等地的五个石灰氮肥厂。这些化学肥料厂在今年内可以建设完工的，主要有永利宁厂和南京磷肥厂。兰州和四川两个氮肥厂的一套氮肥工程也可以在今年基本完成。今年新增加的氮肥（折成硫铵）的生产能力是十八万八千吨，磷肥是四十万吨。年产三十万吨磷矿石粉的江苏锦屏磷矿，也要在今年建成。
    鉴于今年化学肥料工业建设任务特别繁重，进度要求又很急迫，而明年以后的建设任务还更加艰巨。因此，积极采取一切有效措施，保证完成今年的建设任务，并创造条件促进今后化学肥料工业的迅速发展，就成为当前一个十分重大的问题。
    在保证质量的前提下，如何加快建设速度，这是化学工业部最近以来经常研究的重大问题之一。这个部经过深入研究以后，肯定在吉林氮肥厂的建设中已经取得良好经验的立体交叉平行流水的施工方法，是适合氮肥工业建设特点的缩短工期的最有效的方法。化学肥料厂的建筑特点是高层建筑多，建筑物最高达三十五、六公尺，如果沿用老一套的施工方法，厂房建筑完成后再进行机器安装，建设期限就很长。在第一个五年计划中，原来安排一个氮肥厂从开工建设到投入生产，大约需要三年时间。吉林氮肥厂在后期施工中，采用土建、安装立体交叉平行流水的施工方法，提前半年完成建厂任务。化工部决定今年要大力推行这种先进的施工方法，并且认为只要加强各方面的工作，把一个氮肥厂的施工期缩短三分之一是完全可能的。今年将要开工建设的太原氮肥厂已经提出要在两年的时间内完成建厂的任务。
    化工部经过研究以后，采取了许多节约措施，在不影响正常生产的条件下，能省的就省，能简化的就简化，这样就大大地降低了建设费用，新建一个氮肥厂要比吉林氮肥厂节省投资40％。
    积极培养技术力量特别是培养化学肥料工业建设所需的各种技术骨干和特殊工种如高压钳工、高压管工、高级焊工、防腐工、计器工等等，对于化学肥料工业的建设速度具有决定性的影响。化工部已经提出计划，并且要求马上动手进行这项工作。为了解决各省市建设化肥厂的技术骨干问题，安徽、湖南、江苏、河北和山东几个省已经派出三百多人到兰州和吉林两个氮肥厂工地，由化工部帮助培养学习。
    今年地方上新建的几个氮肥厂都是等国内设计好图纸才能开始施工。如果按过去一个厂搞一套设计的方法，现在化工部一个氮肥设计院根本不可能完成这个任务。化工部采取的迅速有效的措施就是做定型设计。这个部的氮肥设计院集中了二百多名工程技术人员，从去年10月以来一直紧张地进行氮肥厂的定型设计工作。原来计划图纸到今年6月底完成，现在看来5月底就可以完成了。
    除了兰州和太原两个氮肥厂由苏联供应主要设备、四川氮肥厂由捷克斯洛伐克供应设备外，今年其他新建和扩建的肥料厂和今后开工建设的肥料厂的设备，都全部由我国自己制造。保证及时完成这些设备的制造任务，也是保证完成化学肥料工业建设任务的主要关键之一。机器制造工业部门在这方面做了许多工作，抓得也很紧，最近还要派出一个专门小组到东北有关工厂检查设备制造进行的情况。
