    To Be a Socialist-Conscious and Cultured Worker
    The Great Debate on "Redness" vs. Expertise at Tsinghua University Concludes

    (Our dispatch) The socialist debate on the theme of "How to be a worker and how to be a proletarian intellectual," conducted by nearly ten thousand students at Tsinghua University, has now come to a conclusion. Through the debate, most students have clarified how to be a socialist worker and the path to be taken to become a proletarian intellectual. The debate has been very fruitful, not only clarifying the direction but also promoting socialist democracy and boosting everyone's confidence in following the path of being both "red" and expert. Principal Jiang Nanxiang delivered a summary report to the entire student body on the 4th. The report emphasized that correct political viewpoints are the soul, that the "middle road" is not worth clinging to, that the superstition of science above all else must be abandoned, and that we must wholeheartedly serve the people, be socialist workers, and be proletarian intellectuals.

    Jiang Nanxiang first stated that politics is the soul. The issue we need to resolve in the discussion of "redness" versus expertise" is not about what kind of work we do, but about our political attitude towards the Party and socialism, and whether we can wholeheartedly serve the people.

    "Redness" and expertise are unified and cannot be separated. Some say, "Less politics, less politics, more expertise, more expertise," but the result is a soulless machine, like an electronic computer, that can serve the exploiting classes as well as the people. This is very dangerous. Only when "redness" and expertise are combined can expertise develop in the correct direction. The successful launch of the Soviet satellite is not only a technical issue but also a political one. Only by combining politics and expertise, "redness" and expertise, can expertise develop better.

    Jiang Nanxiang said that students in school must not only learn technology but also learn how to be workers. This is the difference between our socialist universities and bourgeois universities. Some students say, "Ten years of politics can be made up in one year, but one year of expertise cannot be made up in ten years." This statement is not in line with the facts. Only with the correct political direction and ideological progress can we be good cadres for socialist construction.

    Jiang Nanxiang pointed out that the middle road is not worth clinging to. He first criticized the view that "as long as you don't become a rightist and don't go to the United States," there is no problem. He said that this is a metaphysical view. Looking at the rightists who have been exposed in schools, some of them have not gone to the United States, and they do not outwardly oppose socialism, so why did they become rightists? What kind of person is someone? It cannot be based on his own "self-evaluation," but only on the evaluation of the masses and history.

    Those who are willing to take the middle road have no political direction. To put it bluntly, they are philistines. They only consider personal gains and losses, follow the wind, do not adhere to principles, and do not distinguish between right and wrong. This is a dangerous road.

    Jiang Nanxiang also talked about abandoning the superstition of science above all else. He said that some students have an incorrect understanding of science. They say, "Science has no national boundaries." We say that the principles of science have no national boundaries, but a country's scientific enterprise has a clear class nature. The class nature is determined by whom the scientist serves.

    Science is noble, but it should not be seen as too mysterious, and one should not have the view that "all other professions are inferior, only science is superior." Does science guide production, or does production determine science? It seems that both the statement that scientific invention promotes production and the statement that production determines science are correct. But to get to the bottom of it, it is that mankind created and developed culture and science in labor. Science above all else is a subjective idealist viewpoint. Putting science too high is unscientific and not in line with reality.

    In the debate, many students expressed admiration for bourgeois scientists. Jiang Nanxiang said that their scientific heritage is worth accepting by us. However, we must know that only Marx, Engels, and Lenin are our role models. They are the greatest thinkers, revolutionaries, and scientists, and they are typical examples of the combination of "redness" and expertise. They are the role models for us to learn from.

    Jiang Nanxiang finally pointed out that the correct path for students to take is to wholeheartedly serve the people, be socialist workers, and be proletarian intellectuals. He said, who are the creators of history and the masters of the era? It is the workers. Our measure of a person's value is how the individual relates to the people. High or low status, high or low academic achievement, are not the most fundamental prerequisites for measuring a person's historical value. To be a socialist worker is to take the most correct, most creative, and most promising path. This is a scientific path.

### 做有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者  清华大学红与专大辩论结束

    做有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者
    清华大学红与专大辩论结束
    本报讯　清华大学近万名学生以“怎样做一个劳动者，怎样做工人阶级知识分子”为题开展的社会主义大辩论，现已告一段落。通过辩论，大多数同学都明确了如何做一个社会主义的劳动者，做一个工人阶级知识分子要走的道路。这次辩论收获很大，不仅方向明确了，还发扬了社会主义的民主，鼓舞了大家走又红又专道路的信心。校长蒋南翔在4日向全校学生作了总结报告。报告中着重指出正确的政治观点是灵魂，“中间道路”不值得留恋，要抛弃科学至上的迷信，全心全意为人民服务，做一个社会主义的劳动者，做一个工人阶级的知识分子。
    蒋南翔首先谈到，政治是灵魂。我们在红与专的讨论中，要解决的问题是不在于做什么工作，而在于对党对社会主义的政治态度，能不能全心全意为人民服务。
    红与专是统一的，不能分开。有人说，“政治少些再少些，业务多些再多些”，结果就成为没有灵魂的机器，就像电子计算机一样，可以为剥削阶级服务，也可以为人民服务。这是非常危险的。只有红和专结合起来，才能使业务向正确的方向发展。苏联人造卫星的发射成功，不仅是技术问题，还有政治因素的作用。只有政治和业务结合，红与专结合，业务才能更好的发展。
    蒋南翔说，学生在学校里不仅要学技术，还要学怎样做一个劳动者。这是我们社会主义大学与资产阶级大学的不同点。有的学生说，“政治十年不学一年补，业务一年不学十年补”。这种说法是不符合事实的。只有政治方向正确，思想上进步，才是社会主义建设的好干部。
    蒋南翔指出，中间道路不值得留恋。他首先批判了那种“不作右派，不去美国”就没有问题了的观点。他说，这是形而上学的观点。从学校中揭发出来的右派看，有的人也没有去美国，表面上也不反对社会主义，为什么成了右派呢？一个人是怎样的人物？不能根据他自己的“自我评价”，只能由群众、历史来作评价。
    愿意走中间道路的人，政治上没有什么方向，说穿了就是市侩主义。只考虑个人得失，看风使舵，不坚持原则立场，不辨明大是大非，这是一条危险的道路。
    蒋南翔还谈到要抛弃科学至上的迷信。他说，有些同学对科学有不正确的理解。他们说，“科学无国界”。我们说，科学原理没有国界，一个国家的科学事业，就有鲜明的阶级性。科学家为谁服务就是有阶级性的。
    科学是高尚的，但不能看得太神秘了，不能有“万般皆下品，唯有科学高”的看法。是科学指导生产，还是生产决定科学呢？科学发明推动生产，生产决定科学，这说法似乎都对。但要追根究底，那就是人类在劳动中创造和发展了文化科学。科学至上是唯心论观点。把科学放的太高就不科学，不符合实际。
    在辩论中，许多学生对资产阶级的科学家表示崇拜。蒋南翔说，他们的科学遗产是值得我们接受的。但是，我们要知道，只有马克思、恩格斯、列宁才是我们的榜样。他们是最伟大的思想家、革命家和科学家，是红与专结合的典型。他们才是我们学习的榜样。
    蒋南翔最后指出，同学们应该走的一条正确的道路是全心全意为人民服务，做一个社会主义的劳动者，做一个工人阶级知识分子。他说，谁是历史的创造者、时代的主人呢？是劳动者。我们衡量一个人的价值是看个人和人民的关系如何？地位高低，学术的高低，不是衡量一个人的历史价值的最根本的前提。我们要做一个社会主义劳动者就是走一个最正确、最有创造性、最有前途的道路。这是条科学的道路。
