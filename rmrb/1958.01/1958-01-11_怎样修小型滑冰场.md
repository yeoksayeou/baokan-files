    Below is a brief introduction to two methods for building small ice rinks.
      Natural Ice Rink
    A natural ice rink is made by utilizing a pond, lake, or river and requires a very simple process. As long as the ice thickness reaches 15-20 cm (approximately 5-7 inches), mark out an area on the ice surface to serve as the rink's dimensions, then enclose it with wooden posts and clean it up, and you have a simple natural ice rink.
    If it has snowed, the snow should be swept to the surroundings and piled up to form a snow wall. To prevent the wind from blowing snow into the rink, some water can be poured on the snow pile to solidify it.
            Artificial Ice Rink
    First, level the selected site and sweep away any loose soil and rocks. Then, build an earth wall around it, about 20 cm high and 40 cm wide, and pour a layer of water on the wall to freeze it solid. Next, find rubber belts, water hoses, or buckets, and prepare to pour water into the rink.
    It is best not to use water containing debris when pouring the ice rink, otherwise the poured ice rink will be uneven.
    Before pouring water, you should first sprinkle water on the ground to freeze it into a thin layer of ice. Then, start pouring water sequentially from one end of the site, so that the water can naturally and quickly flow away, and the frozen ice surface will be very smooth.
    If the ice rink is large, the water should be poured several times, thickening the ice surface layer by layer. This can prevent incomplete freezing and the formation of gaps in the middle of the ice layer. If the ice rink is small, it can be poured all at once. The ice is ready to use when it is 2-5 cm thick.
    When pouring ice with cold water, a temperature of -1 to -7 degrees Celsius is more suitable. If the weather is too cold, hot water should be used to pour the ice rink. Otherwise, the ice surface will be uneven. If the frozen ice surface has unevenness, it should be leveled with a shovel, the ice shavings swept away, and then sprinkled with water. Then drag it once with a bottomless wooden bucket padded with rubber or felt, and the ice surface will be smooth.

    下面简略地介绍两种建造小型滑冰场的方法。
      天然滑冰场
    天然滑冰场是利用池塘、湖沼或河流修整起来的，方法非常简便。只要冰冻的厚度达到15—20公分（约5—7市寸）时，在冰面上划出一个地方作为冰场的面积，然后用木柱圈起来，打扫干净，就是一个简便的天然滑冰场了。
    如果已经下过雪，就应把雪扫到四周，堆成一道雪围墙。为了不让风把雪吹到冰场里，在雪堆上可以浇些水，使它坚固。
            人造滑冰场
    先把选择好的场地铺平，并扫除上面的浮土和石块，再在四周堆一道高约20公分宽约40公分的土墙，并在墙上浇一层水，让它冻好。然后再找出胶皮带、水龙带或水桶，准备往冰场里浇水。
    浇冰场，最好不用带有杂物的水，否则浇出的冰场会不平滑。
    浇水前，应先在地面上洒水一次，使之冻成一层薄冰面，然后从场地一头开始顺序浇水，这样水就能自然地很快地流走，结冻的冰面就很平滑。
    如果冰场较大，浇水就应该分几次进行，一层一层把冰面加厚，这样可以避免不易结冻和使冰层中间形成空隙；如果冰场较小，可以一次浇好。冰厚到2—5公分，即可使用。
    用凉水浇冰时，以气温零下1—7度较适宜，假如天气太冷，就应用热水浇冰场。否则冰面就会凹凸不平。如果结冻后的冰面有凹凸不平现象，就应用铲铲平，扫去冰沫，再洒上水，然后用垫有胶皮或毡片的无底木桶拖一次，冰面就会光滑了。
