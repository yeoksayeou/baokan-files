Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 16th: At the state-owned Xiangfan Cotton Mill in Hubei, one can see everywhere an inspiring, mass-based style of frugality. The slogan "No waste of a nail, a thread, or a penny" has been embodied in the production activities of the workers.

This cotton mill, with just over three hundred people, was originally quite weak financially, and its production equipment was also very outdated. In 1957, it also encountered the difficulty of insufficient cotton yarn supply. However, all the workers in the factory overcame the difficulties with vigorous revolutionary spirit, and comprehensively completed the 1957 production plan one month ahead of schedule. Last year, the profits turned over to the state exceeded the total value of the factory's fixed assets.

The mass-based style of running the enterprise frugally is first manifested in the fact that the workers have developed various ways to save on production. In 1957, the factory's workshop expenses were only one-sixth of those in 1956. Many workers learned the skills of blacksmiths, carpenters, bamboo weavers, bricklayers, and barbers, and consciously took on the work of repairing the factory's machines and buildings. The workers found many substitutes, using a wild tree fruit to replace the yellow wax for pulling cart threads, and using red clay and yellow clay to make strips to replace chalk, etc. Worker Lan Fuchun, in order to save talcum powder, visited farmers in the countryside on Sundays and finally found a substitute yellow soil on the mountain, saving more than 2,000 catties of talcum powder a year. Weavers pick up all the two-inch-long waste thread ends and small thread ends used for bundling yarn, spin them, paste them, and then weave them into the edges of the cloth. Therefore, in the ten months of 1957, the cotton yarn saved by the workers was about 7% of the total yarn consumption for the year.

The collective welfare undertakings of this factory are all solved by the workers themselves, without spending a penny of the state's money, or spending very little. The factory runs a nursery, and the beds, braziers, drying racks, and door curtains are all made by the workers using waste materials from the factory. The factory only spent thirty cents to buy some lime and flour to paint and wallpaper the walls. The factory's bathhouse and barber shop were also built by the workers themselves in a simple and crude manner. The factory did not have a basketball court, so the workers leveled the ground themselves and solved the problem with an old basketball hoop from another unit.

The education on diligence and thrift is so deeply rooted in this factory that people can see many touching examples here at any time. Xia Ruizhen, an old worker in his fifties, automatically repaired more than 300 waste spools for the factory last year; workers picked up the remaining ink from ink boxes discarded by a neighboring factory and brought it back to the factory; female workers took time to pick up vegetable leaves, duckweed, and watermelon rinds from outside to feed the pigs raised in the factory; the factory cook used waste charcoal baskets to weave sieves for use, saving the factory expenses. Therefore, in 1957, the administrative management expenses of each cadre in this factory averaged only 0.88 yuan.

The formation of this very gratifying style of diligence and thrift in the Xiangfan Cotton Mill is inseparable from the exemplary actions of the factory leaders. Liang Yanbin (female), the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch of this factory, is an excellent cadre who has always been diligent and thrifty and very concerned about the lives of the workers. In order to use ashes water instead of kerosene to scrub the machines, she personally carried ashes, mixed thin mud, and experimented with the workers. In the summer, she sewed sunshades for the workers; she took a trowel and built the walls of the toilet for the workers. Ruan Yisheng, the factory director, and other cadres also helped repair houses, dredge sewers, and carry well water to cool down the workshops. Their exemplary actions educated all the workers in the factory.

### 不浪费一钉一线一文钱  襄樊棉织厂勤俭成风

    不浪费一钉一线一文钱
    襄樊棉织厂勤俭成风
    新华社武汉16日电　在地方国营湖北襄樊棉织厂里，处处都可以看到一种令人振奋的、群众性的勤俭风尚。“不浪费一钉一线一文钱”的行动口号，已在职工群众的生产活动中体现出来。
    这个有三百多人的棉织厂，本来家底十分单薄，生产设备也很陈旧，1957年又遇到棉纱供应不足的困难。但是，全厂职工克勤克俭，用蓬蓬勃勃的革命朝气，战胜了困难，提前一个月全面地完成了1957年生产计划，去年一年上缴国家的利润超过了这个工厂的固定资产总值。
    群众性的勤俭办企业的风尚，首先表现在职工们已经从生产上开拓了多种多样的节约门路。1957年这个工厂的车间费用只及1956年的六分之一，很多工人学会了铁匠、木匠、篾匠、泥瓦匠和理发匠的技能，自觉地担负起了修理本厂机器、房屋的工作。工人们找到了许多代用品，用一种野树果代替拉车线的黄腊，用红粘土、黄粘土搓成条条代替粉笔等。工人蓝富春，为了节约滑石粉，利用星期天下乡访问农民，终于在山上找到了一种可以代用的黄土，一年节约了两千多斤滑石粉。织布工人把二寸长的废线头、捆纱的小线头统统拣起来，纺一纺，浆一浆，再织到布边上。因此，1957年十个月中，工人们节省的棉纱，约为全年用纱量的7％。
    这个工厂的集体福利事业，都是由职工们自己动手解决的，不花国家一文钱，或者花得极少。工厂办了一个托儿间，床铺、火盆、烘罩、门帘等都是工人们用厂里的废料做成的，工厂只花了三角钱买了一点石灰、面粉，粉刷、裱糊墙壁。厂里的洗澡间和理发室，也是工人因陋就简自己动手建立的。工厂没有篮球场，职工们自己动手平了场地，用别个单位的一个旧球架，也就解决了。
    勤俭节约的教育，在这个工厂是这样深入人心，使人们在这里随时可以看到许多感人的事例。五十多岁的老工人夏瑞珍，去年自动为工厂修好了三百多个废套筒；工人们从邻近一个工厂丢弃的油墨盒子里，把残余的油墨拣回工厂；女工们抽空从外面拣回菜叶子、萍菜、西瓜皮，饲喂工厂里养的猪；工厂炊事员用废炭篓子编成筲箕使用，节省工厂开支。因此，1957年这个工厂每个干部的行政管理费用，平均只用了零点八八元。
    襄樊棉织厂形成了这种十分可喜的勤俭风尚，是跟工厂领导人的示范行动分不开的。这个工厂的中共党支部书记梁彦斌（女），就是一贯克勤克俭、十分关怀工人生活的优秀干部。为了用灶灰水代替煤油擦洗机器，她亲自端灶灰，拌稀泥，和工人一起试验。夏天，她给工人们缝制凉棚；她拿着泥刀给工人砌厕所的墙。工厂厂长阮宜生和其他干部，也都曾动手修房子，疏浚阴沟，挑井水给车间降温。他们这些示范行动，教育了全厂职工。
