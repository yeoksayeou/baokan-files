Thoughts on an Untitled Subject
钟怀

In some places, when the masses were eliminating the Four Pests, they put forward a slogan: Strike early, strike small, strike decisively!

This slogan is very good. If implemented, the Four Pests will not be able to breed.

This slogan is not only useful for eliminating mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows. To eradicate the Four Pests in people's minds—individualism, liberalism, and so on—shouldn't we also strike early, strike small, and strike decisively?

Some people may have physical disabilities, but their spirit is not disabled at all. Not only is it not disabled, but it shines brightly. Yu Xietian, a Communist Party member introduced by the People's Daily on January 7th, who lost both hands in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, still insisted on participating in labor production and "always sought out work with high labor intensity and few work points." He is such a person.

Some people may be physically healthy, even young and strong, but their spirit is disabled. There is such a "young writer" who wants "more stimulating things" – royalties – when he writes. He wants to strive to earn 30,000 yuan, "By that time, it would be better to be able to write something, but if I can't write, it's not illegal to just live off the interest."

Physical disability is not a sin, but spiritual disability is. May everyone be physically and mentally healthy. If "you cannot have both," then give up physical health and choose mental health!

    有的地方的群众在除四害的时候，提出了一个口号：打早，打小，打了！
    这个口号很好。实行起来，管教四害孳生不了。
    岂止是消灭蚊、蝇、鼠、雀用得着这个口号。要根除人们思想上的四害——个人主义、自由主义等等，不也得打早、打小、打了？
    有人身体虽然残废，可是精神一点也不残废。不但不残废，而且闪闪发光。1月7日人民日报介绍的在抗美援朝中失去了双手，仍然坚持参加劳动生产，而且“总是找劳动强度大、工分少的活来干”的共产党员余协田，就是这样的人。
    有人虽然身体健康，甚至年青力壮，精神却是残废的。有这样的“青年作家”，他写作时要“多来点刺激性的东西”——稿费，他要为挣三万元人民币而奋斗，“到那时候，能够写点东西更好，不能写，只吃利息也不犯法。”
    身体残废不是罪过，精神残废才是罪过。愿所有的人身心健康。万一“二者不可得兼”，那就舍身体健康而取精神健康吧！
