    Guizhou, January 19th (from our correspondent) In a high and cold mountainous area called "Seven Bowls Shelf" in Renhuai County, Guizhou Province, the home of Maotai liquor, a junior high school combining farming and study has been established. This school, named Qunli Farm Amateur Junior High School, was established in the summer of 1957 by the Renhuai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Committee, based on the demands of the masses and using the site of an old farm.

    The establishment of this school has received warm support from the masses. Nearby agricultural cooperatives such as Nongxing and Xingfu sent cattle, piglets, timber, and farm tools. The district joint clinic sent a batch of medical supplies, and district and township cadres sent books, periodicals, and sports equipment. The government also allocated a subsidy of four thousand yuan. The junior high school currently has 226 students, including 200 children of workers and peasants.

    The school's educational policy is: "Focusing on production, and on the premise of ensuring self-sufficiency in production, strive to complete the junior high school teaching tasks in three years." The arrangement of labor and study is: half a day for reading and half a day for production, less reading on sunny days, and more reading on rainy days. The curriculum is the same as ordinary middle schools. The school's production management is the same as the agricultural cooperatives, with a production management committee and four production teams organized in each class, totaling sixteen production teams. There are fixed cultivated areas, work is evaluated and points are recorded, and remuneration is based on labor.

    Teachers and students labor, study, entertain themselves, and live together. The teaching method is: the lessons are closely integrated with production. For example, when teaching botany, it is combined with fertilizer accumulation, teaching students to master the scientific knowledge and technology of high-temperature rapid composting and fertilizer soaking. This teaching method is practical, vivid, and students' understanding is profound.

    This school has been consolidated after overcoming many difficulties. In the early days of the school, the school buildings were dilapidated, and the land reclaimed by the farm in the past was barren. The students had to carry water and transport rice themselves, and also prepare for autumn planting. Although most of the students had the habit of labor and were willing to combine farming and study, they lacked confidence in the school's future development. A small number of students also showed wavering, fearing that they would not learn "knowledge" and miss their "future." Some complained that the labor was hard, dirty, and unbearable. Students from poor families were thinly clad and worried about getting through the cold winter. In response to these situations, the school's Communist Youth League organization carried out political and ideological education activities. Through League classes and seminars, education was conducted on the glory of labor and diligence and thrift. The heroic deeds of revolutionary martyrs and model figures were used to educate and encourage students to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, build mountainous areas, and learn culture well. At the time of the school's establishment, it was the autumn planting season. The school organized students to carry out autumn planting, fertilizer accumulation, firewood cutting, pig raising, and other production work. The League organization combined the school's production plan to educate students to love the farm as their home and establish the idea of taking the farm school as their home.

    After ideological education and practice, the students demonstrated valuable enthusiasm for labor and study. After one month of school, everything was normal, and the students studied diligently and labored happily. Many students wrote letters to their families and former teachers, expressing their determination to use their working hands to build this sparsely populated place into a mountain of flowers and fruits.

    After nearly four months of efforts by teachers and students, the school has shown a new look. Great gains have been made in labor, learning, and ideology. Stout seedlings and vegetables have grown on the barren mountains. Sixty mu of wheat, twenty mu of vegetables, three mu of daylilies, and thirty mu of buckwheat will all have a good harvest. All teachers and students in the school have now accumulated more than 600,000 jin of fertilizer, raised more than 100 pigs, and raised 15 head of cattle, and are carrying out winter agricultural and sideline production, plowing the barren land for spring sowing.

    The students' enthusiastic labor has not relaxed their studies. In a literature test in the second class, out of 52 students, 5 got a score of 5, 36 got a score of 4, 9 got a score of 3, and only 2 got a score of 2. In an arithmetic test in the fourth class, out of 52 students, 10 got a score of 5, 36 got a score of 4, 4 got a score of 3, and 2 also got a score of 2. There has also been some increase in labor skills. 87 people have learned to plow, 142 people have mastered the technology of high-temperature composting and fertilizer soaking, and 37 carpenters, 12 woodworkers, 38 plank sawyers, 2 barbers, and 1 health worker have also been trained. In addition, in this place where every step is a mountain, the students used their own hands to tidy up two ball fields and make table tennis tables, and sports activities and cultural and recreational life also seemed very active.

    The masses here have responded well to this school combining farming and study. Everyone firmly believes that in three years, this group of young people will become a new type of peasant with culture, knowledge, and labor skills.

    贵州仁怀县群力农场业余初级中学
    学习文化同时建设山区
    本报讯　在茅台酒产地——贵州省仁怀县内一个名叫“七碗架”的高寒山地，建立了一所边耕边读的初级中学。这个名叫群力农场业余初级中学，是中共仁怀县委和人民委员会，根据群众的要求，利用一个农场的旧址，在1957年夏季举办的。
    这个学校在建校过程中，受到了广大群众的热烈拥护和支持。附近的农兴、幸福等农业社，有的送耕牛，有的送猪仔，有的送木材和农具；区联合诊所送了一批医药用品；区乡干部送了书刊和体育用品。政府也拨给了补助费四千元。这个初级中学现在有学生二百二十六名，其中有工农子弟二百名。
    这所学校的办学方针是：“以生产为主，在保证生产自给的前提下，争取三年完成初级中学的教学任务”。劳动和学习的安排是：半天读书，半天生产，晴天少读，雨天多读。学习的课程与普通中学一样。学校的生产管理与农业社一样，设有生产管理委员会，每班组织四个生产队，共十六个生产队。有固定的耕作区，干活评工计分，实行按劳取酬。
    教师和学生同劳动，同学习，同娱乐，生活一起。教学的方法是：课文紧紧结合生产。如上植物课时，就结合积肥，教学生们学会掌握高温速成堆肥和沤肥的科学知识和技术。这样的教学方法切实、生动，学生理解也深刻。
    这个学校是克服了许多困难才巩固下来的。开学初期，校舍破旧，过去农场开垦的土地已荒芜。学生们要自己动手挑水、运米，又要作好秋种准备。虽然学生中大部分人有劳动习惯，愿意边耕边读，但对学校的发展前途缺乏信心。也有一小部分学生表现动摇，怕学不到“知识”，误了“前途”。有的嫌劳动苦、脏、吃不消。家庭贫苦的同学，衣衫单薄，还怕难过寒冬。根据这些情况，这个学校的共青团组织开展了政治思想教育活动。通过上团课和座谈会等形式，进行了劳动光荣、勤劳俭朴的教育，运用革命先烈和模范人物的英勇事迹，教育和鼓励同学们发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，建设山区，学好文化。建校时正值秋种季节，学校组织学生进行秋种工作和积肥、砍柴、养猪等生产活路。团组织就结合学校制定的生产规划，对同学们进行了爱场如家的教育，树立以场校为家的思想。
    经过思想教育和实践，学生们发挥了可贵的劳动和学习的热情，开学一月以后，学校一切都正常了，学生们用功地学习，愉快地劳动。很多学生在给家庭和原来的老师写信中，表示要用劳动的双手，把这人烟稀少的地方，建成一座花果山。
    经过师生们近四个月来的努力，学校已呈现了一片新的景象。在劳动上、学习上、思想上，都有了很大收获。荒山上长出了肥壮的禾苗和蔬菜。六十亩麦子、二十亩蔬菜、三亩黄花、三十亩荞麦，都将获得丰收。全校师生现在已积肥六十多万斤，喂猪一百余头，饲养耕牛十五头，并且在进行冬季的农副业生产，翻犁今春播种的荒土。
    学生们热情的劳动，并没有放松了学习。第二班的一次文学测验，五十二人中得五分的五人，得四分的三十六人，得三分的九人，二分只有二人；第四班的一次算术测验，五十二人中，得五分的十人，得四分的三十六人，得三分的四人，得二分的也是二人。在劳动技术上也有一定的增长。学会犁土的已有八十七人，能掌握高温堆肥、沤肥技术的有一百四十二人；还培养出了三十七个土匠、十二个木匠、三十八个解板子手、二个理发师、一个卫生员。此外，就在这个举步皆山的地方，学生们用自己的双手，整理好两个球场，做了乒乓球台等，体育锻炼活动和文化娱乐生活也显得十分活跃。
    这里的群众对这所边耕边读的学校，反映很好。大家都坚信：三年之后，这批青年将成为有文化、有知识、有劳动本领的新型农民。
