Bengbu, January 13th (Reported by our newspaper) – Focusing on water conservancy construction, and closely integrating fertilizer accumulation, topdressing, winter irrigation, greening, and the elimination of the four pests to promote an all-round high tide in winter production – this is the most prominent characteristic of the Anhui Province Bengbu Prefectural Committee's leadership in the region's winter production. Currently, more than 2.4 million people in the Bengbu region are engaged in water conservancy construction, progressing at a rate of 10 million cubic meters of earthwork per day. By the 11th, over 580 million cubic meters had been completed. Before the Spring Festival, the region will exceed its additional task of 660 million cubic meters of earthwork.

Fertilizer accumulation, topdressing, winter irrigation, greening, and other tasks are developing vigorously like water conservancy. The Bengbu region has already achieved "toilets for every person, and pens for every pig." Of the 1,748,000 peasant households in the region, the number of newly built and renovated toilets, plus the existing ones, totals more than 1,759,000. The number of newly built, renovated, and existing pigsties has reached over 930,000. In the rural areas of the eight counties in northern Anhui, the phenomenon of human and animal urine and manure everywhere, which was common in the past, has disappeared. The enthusiasm of the masses of peasants in accumulating fertilizer is even greater, and the region has accumulated more than 2.84 million dan of fertilizer, reaching 135.3% of the fertilizer accumulation task assigned to the region by Anhui Province for 1958. In conjunction with fertilizer accumulation, a comprehensive campaign to eliminate the four pests has also been launched, eliminating more than 32,000 jin of mosquitoes, flies, and fly pupae, and catching more than 1.12 million rats, sparrows, and harmful birds, and destroying more than 83,000 rat holes and sparrow nests. The region has also launched a large-scale "working with one heart and one mind, pursuing the victory, and not letting the four pests spend the Spring Festival" pest elimination month starting from the 11th.

With good water conservancy and plenty of fertilizer, the commune members pay even more attention to putting effort into the summer harvest crop fields. The region has already topdressed more than 13.62 million mu, accounting for 85.3% of the planned topdressing area. From December 25th of last year to recently, Dangshan County has been conducting a topdressing blitz with more than 80,000 people every day. The county's 780,000 mu of summer harvest crops have all been topdressed once. More than 88,000 commune members from nineteen townships including Guanzhuang, Wuji, Xiejie, and Chengnan, used all kinds of tools and animal power to pull, push, lift, carry, and haul, working continuously for four to six days and nights.

After achieving certain results in topdressing, the counties have promptly carried out winter irrigation on wheat fields. Dangshan County alone has irrigated more than 143,000 mu. To prevent rain and snow from accumulating and causing waterlogging, 5.65 million mu of wheat fields in lower-lying areas across the region have had their drainage ditches cleared. As a result of carrying out this series of field management tasks, the region's more than 22 million mu of summer-harvest crops are currently lush green and growing well.

The progress of greening is also unprecedented in scale throughout the region. On the wasteland and barren mountains on both sides of the Jinpu, Huainan, and Longhai railways within the territory, on both sides of more than 2,200 li of highways, on the banks of more than 840 li of rivers, on the old course of the Yellow River, around many villages, and on many other barren mountains and fields, are dotted with various kinds of saplings self-cultivated by agricultural cooperatives. The region has planted a total of more than 334,000 mu of forest, accounting for 66% of the winter and spring greening task. Xiao County, thanks to proper labor allocation, has a total of 355,000 full and semi laborers in the county, with more than 190,000 engaged in water conservancy construction, more than 100,000 engaged in fertilizer accumulation and field management, and another 60,000 engaged in greening and sideline production. Therefore, all tasks are completed ahead of schedule or exceeding the target. Water conservancy construction has completed 187.8% of the winter and spring task, fertilizer accumulation has completed 111.9% of the winter and spring task, wheat field topdressing has completed 124.5% of the task, and the greening task has completed 248%.

    安徽蚌埠专区以兴修水利为中心
    各项生产活动齐头并进
    积肥冬灌绿化除四害都有很大成绩
    本报蚌埠13日电　以兴修水利为中心，把积肥、追肥、冬灌、绿化、除四害等各项工作密切地结合起来，齐头并进，掀起冬季生产全面高潮，这是中共安徽省蚌埠地委领导全区冬季生产最显明的特点。目前蚌埠专区每天有二百四十多万人投入兴修水利运动，进度每天一千万土方，到11日已做了五亿八千多万土方。春节以前，全区将可超额完成追加任务六亿六千多万土方。
    积肥、追肥、冬灌、绿化等项工作像兴修水利一样地蓬勃发展。蚌埠专区已经实现人有厕所、猪有圈。全区一百七十四万八千多农户，改建、新建的厕所，加上原有的厕所，共达一百七十五万九千多个，新建、改建和原有的猪圈已达九十三万多个。淮北八县农村里，过去到处是人畜尿粪的现象，现在已没有了。农民群众积肥的劲头更大了，全区已积肥二百八十四万多担，达到安徽省1958年度分配给该专区的积肥任务的135.3％。结合积肥，还全面地展开了除四害运动，消灭蚊子、苍蝇、蝇蛹三万二千多斤，捕捉老鼠、麻雀、害鸟一百一十二万多只，堵毁鼠洞、雀窝八万三千多个。全区又从11日起，开展一个“同心协力，乘胜追击，不让四害过春节”的声势浩大的除四害运动月。
    水利修的好，肥料积的多，社员们就更加注意在午季作物田里下工夫了。全区已追肥一千三百六十二万多亩，占计划追肥面积的85.3％。砀山县从去年12月25日到近日，每天以八万多人开展追肥突击运动，午季作物七十八万亩，全部追肥一次；官庄、吴集、谢集、城南等十九个乡的八万八千多社员，运用一切工具和畜力，拉、推、提、担、抬，一连干了四至六个昼夜。
    在追肥工作取得一定成绩后，各县已及时对麦田进行了冬季灌溉。仅砀山一县就已灌溉一十四万三千多亩。为防止雨雪积涝，全区已有五百六十五万亩地势较洼的麦田清理好墒沟。由于进行了这一系列的田间管理工作，目前全区二千二百多万亩午收作物一片葱绿，生长良好。
    绿化工作的进展规模也是全区史无前例的。在境内的津浦、淮南、陇海三条铁路两旁的荒地荒山上，在二千二百多里公路的两侧，在八百四十多里河道的两岸，在废黄河故道上，在许多村庄的周围，以及其他许多荒山、田野上，都点缀着农业社自育的各种各样的树苗，全区共已造林三十三万四千多亩，占冬春绿化任务的66％。萧县由于劳动力安排得当，全县整半劳动力三十五万五千个，搞兴修水利的一十九万多人，积肥和田间管理的十万多人，另外六万多人搞绿化、副业生产。因此各项工作都提前或超额完成。兴修水利完成冬春任务187.8％，积肥完成冬春任务111.9％，麦田追肥完成任务124.5％，绿化任务完成248％。（附图片）
