    Teleprinter Comes Out
    From 1958, China's telecommunications and radio communications personnel will be able to use domestically produced teleprinters for communication. Today, the employees of the Shanghai Post and Telecommunications Equipment Factory have produced the first batch of Type 55 teleprinters as a gift to 1958.
    The teleprinter is about the size of an ordinary English typewriter. As long as the operator presses the keys on the teleprinter, another teleprinter, even if it's far away, can directly print clear and correct codes or English, five times faster than a telegraph operator copying, and without errors.
    This teleprinter is made entirely of domestic materials and designed and manufactured by Chinese technicians themselves.

    电传打字机问世
    我国电讯和无线电通讯人员，从1958年开始可以用国产的电传打字机来通讯了。今天，上海邮电器材厂的职工已制出第一批五五型电传打字机，作为向1958年的献礼。
    电传打字机像一台普通英文打字机那样大小，只要报务员在电传打字机上揿动字键，那么，远在天涯海角的另一台电传打字机上，就能直接打出清晰端正的码子或英文来，速度比报务员抄写快五倍，并且不出差错。
    这种电传打字机是完全用国产材料和由我国技术人员自行设计制成的。
