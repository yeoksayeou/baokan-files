    Production of Fertilizer Equipment
    In order to support the great development of agriculture, the Heilongjiang Peace Machinery Factory and six factories are collaborating to produce large-scale fertilizer equipment. The factory's preliminary plan this year is to produce two 1Г-166 high-pressure gas compressors and ten 5-ammonium high-pressure circulating compressors. On the basis of completing this task, preliminary arrangements have been made to produce a maximum of sixteen sets of various nitrogen fertilizer equipment annually during the second five-year plan, which can be used to equip four factories with an annual output of 75,000 tons of synthetic ammonium.
