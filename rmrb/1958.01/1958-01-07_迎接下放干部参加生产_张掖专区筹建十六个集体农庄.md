Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, January 5th: Zhangye Prefecture is stepping up preparations for the establishment of sixteen collective farms to welcome the 20,000 transferred cadres from Gansu Province, Beijing, and other places who will be participating in the construction of the Hexi Corridor grain and cotton base.

These sixteen farms are distributed across seven counties in the fertile Hexi Corridor: Wuwei, Yongchang, Minle, Shandan, Jiuquan, Yumen, and Anxi. The area of reclaimed land is approximately 900,000 mu. This area has relatively favorable irrigation conditions, and the yield of grain crops can reach more than 200 jin per mu in the first two years.

In order to ensure that the transferred cadres can promptly engage in production upon arriving at the farms and smoothly complete the task of reclaiming an average of two mu of wasteland per person this year, the party and government leaders of Zhangye Prefecture are personally presiding over the planning of the farm establishment. They have repeatedly studied issues such as the land quality and irrigation conditions of the farms and have directly participated in the surveying work. Currently, relevant departments and the masses of farmers in each county are actively preparing houses, vehicles, livestock, and other implements for the future farm members. Farmers in Anxi County have decided to repair simple roads leading to each farm and are rushing to build more than 400 houses in the "Immigrant New Village" near the farms to be lent to the transferred cadres for accommodation. The cooperative supply and marketing departments in the prefecture are rushing to produce hundreds of large carts and a large number of small farm implements. Ethnic minorities in the pastoral areas are also selecting 2,000 of their best livestock to provide to the transferred cadres for use in production.

    迎接下放干部参加生产
    张掖专区筹建十六个集体农庄
    据新华社兰州5日电　张掖专区正在加紧筹建十六个集体农庄，迎接甘肃省和北京市等地参加河西走廊粮棉基地建设的两万名下放干部。
    这十六个农庄分布在富饶的河西走廊上的武威、永昌、民乐、山丹、酒泉、玉门和安西等七个县。垦地面积约为九十万亩。这里有比较优裕的灌溉条件，种植粮食作物在头两年每亩产量就可以达到二百斤以上。
    为了使下放干部来到农庄后能及时投入生产，顺利地完成今年平均每人开垦两亩荒地的任务，张掖专区的党政领导人都亲自主持建立农庄的计划工作。他们曾多次研究了农庄的土地质量和灌溉条件等问题，并直接参与了勘查工作。现在，各县有关部门和农民群众，正积极为未来的庄员们准备房屋、车辆、牲畜和其他用具。安西县农民已决定修好通到各个农庄的简易公路，并且在赶修农庄附近“移民新村”的四百多间房屋，先借给下放干部居住。专区合作供销部门在赶制数百辆大车和大量小型农具。牧区的兄弟民族也挑出二千头最好的牲畜，供给下放干部从事生产之用。
