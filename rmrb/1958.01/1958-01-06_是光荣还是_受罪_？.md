Is it Glory or "Suffering"?
Shi Jing Shan Power Plant Worker, Guo Bin

As soon as the rectification campaign started in our factory, a worker in the low-pressure furnace area put up a big-character poster, saying: "The low-pressure furnace is hell... The ash removers are exposed to hot air above their heads, hot winds at their waists, and step in ash water. Is there still such a thing as being worked to death in the new society?"

It's strange that this kind of argument, which sees hard work as "suffering," should come from the mouth of one of our workers. What's even stranger is that it has the support of a small number of workers, so as a worker, I have to say a few words.

It's true that we workers have suffered, but that was in the old society. At that time, we workers really suffered: we couldn't eat enough, we couldn't wear warm clothes, we had no houses to live in, and we didn't know what tomorrow would bring. Young and strong workers could manage better, but when they got old and couldn't work, they were told to get lost. In addition, we had to constantly give gifts to the capitalists, otherwise we wouldn't be treated well. Ask the older masters about these things, and they'll know. It's no exaggeration to say that this was suffering. Now that we are liberated, we workers are the masters of our own house. We work for ourselves, for the construction of our great socialist country. We are no longer oppressed and exploited. Our lives have improved, and we are in good spirits. These are all the benefits that the new society has brought us. Even if this work is harder, can it be called suffering?

Of course, the labor equipment in some of our workshops is still poor, and the work is still hard. But many of our comrades don't complain about it or think that they are "suffering." On the contrary, they believe that since there are still relatively difficult positions, whoever can contribute a share to the collective cause in the most difficult position is the most glorious. As long as conditions permit, we will of course try our best to improve labor conditions. Moreover, our labor conditions have already improved a lot compared to before liberation. Take the work of removing ash and burning low-pressure furnaces, for example. Before liberation, people pushed the ash, and the flames flared up more than two feet long, and it was common to get burned. After liberation, we changed to using animals to pull it. Now we have changed to using water to flush the ash and trucks to haul it away. Isn't that much better than before liberation? Can it still be called "hell"? Moreover, it is fundamentally wrong to use the word "hell" to describe the working life of our new Chinese workers!

I don't deny that the work of low-pressure furnaces is still very hard, but there are many jobs that are even harder than this. The question is how everyone views this kind of work. A worker in the transportation yard said it well in a debate: "We who work in transportation, no matter how cold or hot the weather is, have to push carts of coal from the coal yard to the furnace. We haven't complained, and we don't think it's 'suffering.' But you work indoors, just putting coal on the furnace, and you call it 'suffering,' 'suffering'! What kind of attitude do you have towards today's labor? Aren't you ashamed?..."

It seems that the problem is very clear. Today, although labor is hard, it is glorious to labor for the construction of socialism. People who say that labor is "suffering," like that worker, have the wrong understanding of today's labor. This fact shows that although our workers are engaged in arduous and glorious labor every day, some people don't seem to understand the meaning of labor very well and will even say shameful things. Therefore, I think it is necessary to conduct an education on the understanding of labor among the workers. Although I also advocate continuously improving labor conditions.

### 是光荣还是“受罪”？

    是光荣还是“受罪”？
    石景山发电厂工人　郭彬
    我们厂整风一开始，低压炉有一个工人就贴出一张大字报，里面这样说：“低压炉是地狱，……除灰工头顶热气，腰吹热风，脚踏灰水，新社会还有累死人的罪过吗？……”
    这种把艰苦劳动认为是在“受罪”的论调，竟出在我们工人的口里，真是奇怪。更奇怪的是它竟还得到一小部分工人的支持，因此作为一个工人，我就不能不说几句话了。
    不错，我们工人是受过罪的，但那是旧社会的事。那时候，我们工人真是受苦受难：吃不饱，穿不暖，没有房子住，过了今天不知明天。年轻力壮的还好办些，年老了不能干了，就叫你滚蛋。另外，还得经常给资本家送礼，不然就没好气受。这些事，问问年纪大一点的师傅们都知道的。说这是受苦受罪，是一点不假。现在解放了，我们工人当家作了主人，我们为自己劳动，为建设我们伟大的社会主义国家而劳动，不再受压迫和剥削了，我们的生活改善了，我们的心情愉快了。这都是新社会带给我们的好处，这劳动即使再艰苦些也不能说是受罪？
    当然，我们现在还有些车间的劳动设备要差一些，工作要艰苦一些，但是我们很多工人同志们并不为此叫苦，认为自己在“受罪”，相反，他们认为，既然目前还有比较艰苦的岗位，那末谁能在最艰苦的岗位上为集体事业贡献一分力量，谁就最光荣。只要条件许可，我们当然要尽量改善劳动条件；何况，我们的劳动条件已经比解放前有了许多的改善。就拿除灰和烧低压炉的工作来说吧，解放前是人推灰，那火苗子冒的二尺多长，烫着烧着是经常事；刚解放改用牲口拉；现在又改用水冲灰，用汽车往外拉，不是比解放以前条件已经好得多了吗？还能说这是“地狱”吗？何况用“地狱”二字来形容我们新中国工人的劳动生活，本来就是十分错误的！
    我不否认低压炉的工作现在还是很艰苦的，但是比这艰苦的工作还多得很，问题是在大家如何看待这种劳动。运输场一个工人在辩论中说得好：“我们搞运输的，不管天多冷多热，都要把一车一车的煤从煤场推到炉旁边。我们并没有叫苦，也不觉得这是“受罪”。而你在室内工作，只是给炉上煤，却叫‘受苦’啦，‘受罪’啦，你在用什么眼光看今天的劳动呀！不怕丢人么？……”
    看来问题已经很清楚，在今天，劳动虽然艰苦，但为建设社会主义而劳动是光荣的。像那个工人一样说劳动是“受罪”的人，是对今天的劳动的认识不对头。这个事实说明：我们工人虽然天天在进行艰巨而光荣的劳动，但有些人对劳动的意义似乎并不怎么理解，还会说出丢人的话。因此，在工人中进行一次关于对劳动认识的教育，我看还是有必要的。虽然我也是主张要不断改善劳动条件的。
