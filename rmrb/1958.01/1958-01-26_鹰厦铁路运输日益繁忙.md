    Since the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway was officially put into operation by the state on New Year's Day this year, transportation has become increasingly busy. As of the 22nd, the total amount of goods transported on the entire line reached more than 110,000 tons, an increase of more than 10% compared to the total freight volume from December 1st to 22nd, 1957, before the official operation. Passenger trains have also been changed from small vehicles to large passenger cars, and direct passenger trains between Nanchang and Xiamen have been opened since January 15, further facilitating transportation between Fujian and Nanchang and other places.

    鹰厦铁路运输日益繁忙
    鹰潭—厦门铁路从今年元旦交由国家正式运营以来，运输日趋繁忙。到22日为止，全线运输货物总量共达十一万多吨，比正式运营前的1957年12月1日到22日的货运总量增加了一成多。客运列车也由过去的小型车改为大型客车，并且从1月15日起开办了南昌—厦门对开直达客运列车，进一步便利了福建到南昌等地的交通运输。
