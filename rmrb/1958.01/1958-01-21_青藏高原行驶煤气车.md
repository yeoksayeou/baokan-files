    Coal-powered vehicles travel the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
    The experiment of using coal as fuel for automobiles on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway has been successful. The coal-fueled vehicle test team, departing from Golmud, successfully passed through high-altitude areas and arrived in Lhasa on December 25th of last year. This trial used lump coal produced in the Qaidam Basin as fuel. All vehicles were fully loaded. After various tests, it was proven that the repaired Qinghai-Tibet Highway is suitable for this type of vehicle, and it also proved that coal can be used as fuel for automobiles in plateau areas. Using coal instead of gasoline can greatly reduce transportation costs.

    青藏高原行驶煤气车
    青藏公路上的汽车试验用煤作燃料成功。从葛尔穆出发的以煤作燃料的汽车试验队，顺利地通过高海拔地区，在去年12月25日到达拉萨。这次试行，采用柴达木盆地出产的块煤做燃料，各车全部满载，经过各种试验，证明整修后的青藏公路适合这种汽车行驶，也证明高原地区同样能用煤来作汽车的燃料。用煤代替汽油，可以大大降低运价。
