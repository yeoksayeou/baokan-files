    In the ice-bound Greater Khingan Mountains, workers say:
    "Work faster! Finish today's work to welcome the Second Five-Year Plan!"
    The primeval forest area of the Greater Khingan Mountains, the northernmost part of the motherland, is now frozen for thousands of miles. The continuous mountain ranges are covered with皑皑white snow, and the Siberian cold wind has forced the mercury column of the thermometer to minus forty degrees. In this vast forest area, tens of thousands of forestry workers are ending the last working day of the First Five-Year Plan in a fighting stance.
    Today, braving the severe cold, nearly a hundred workers from Yang Tingyi's logging team at the Chunguli Logging Yard of the Xiniqiqi Forestry Bureau got up an hour earlier than usual, and stepped into the forest at 5:30 in the morning, treading on the foot-deep snow. They took advantage of the starlight reflected on the white snow to make a final assault on the last batch of timber. While working, they shouted, "Work faster! Finish the last day's task ahead of schedule." "Let's do it! Finish today's work to welcome the Second Five-Year Plan!" The shouts, the sound of saws, and the sound of axes echoed through the valley. They completed the last batch of tasks in less than four hours. Afterwards, they moved to the new logging area to prepare for the production of the Second Five-Year Plan starting on January 2.

    在千里冰封的大兴安岭，工人们说：
    “快干哪！今天干完了，好迎接第二个五年计划！”
    祖国最北部的大兴安岭原始林区，现在已经千里冰封。皑皑的白雪复盖着连绵的山岭，西伯利亚的寒风把寒暑表的水银柱逼到了零下四十度。在这广阔的林区里，几万森林工业职工，以战斗的姿态结束了第一个五年计划的最后一个劳动日。
    今天，冒着严寒，把西尼气森工局春古里伐木场杨廷义采伐队的近百名工人比往日早起了一个小时，五点半钟就踏着盈尺的积雪走进了森林。他们借着星空照在白雪上反射的光线突击最后一批木材。他们一边干一边喊：“快干哪！提前完成最后一天任务。”“干啊！今天干完了，好迎接第二个五年计划！”喊声、锯声、斧头声带着回音在山谷里震荡着。他们不到四个小时就完成了最后一批任务。随后他们就转到新伐区去了，准备1月2日就开始第二个五年计划的生产。
