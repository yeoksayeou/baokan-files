Various Regions Actively Prepare Spring Planting Seeds

This newspaper reports that, in order to promote a great leap forward in production and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture, most regions across the country are actively preparing spring planting seeds. According to incomplete statistics, fifteen provinces and regions, including Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Jilin, Liaoning, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Sichuan, have already arranged to purchase over 120 million jin of various spring planting seeds. At the same time, in accordance with the 1958 planting plan, it is generally required that each agricultural cooperative properly handle seed selection and storage.

Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Liaoning and other provinces and regions, with the spirit of "better safe than sorry," also proposed "storing seeds for preparedness against famine." Heilongjiang Province stipulates that rice seeds should be kept 30% in excess, wheat 10%, and corn 30%. The Sichuan Provincial Party Committee also requires agricultural cooperatives to keep 10% more reserve seeds.

This year, as all regions will vigorously carry out production reforms and widely promote improved varieties, various improved varieties have also been widely adjusted. According to recent statistics, the amount of improved varieties of rice, spring wheat, sorghum, and potatoes adjusted between provinces has reached 300 million jin. Among them, the adjusted quantities of improved varieties of rice, potatoes, and cotton are relatively large. Over 10 million jin of early rice "South Special No. 1" have already been adjusted, over 140 million jin of potatoes have been adjusted, 120,000 jin of sweet potatoes, and over 100 million jin of "Dai" cotton seeds have been exchanged. Sichuan, Hebei, Guangdong, Hubei and other provinces, which started earlier, have successively transported the allocated seeds from the areas sending seeds to the areas needing seeds. Provinces that have not yet carried out adjustments are also planning variety matching and formulating seed demand plans. According to the needs of expanding the planting area of double-cropping rice this year, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei and other provinces have determined to transfer more than 150 million jin of early indica and late japonica rice seeds from other provinces. Shandong and Henan are actively developing rice production on the basis of water conservancy construction, and the two provinces plan to transfer a large number of seeds from Hebei. The relevant provinces are currently negotiating the allocation.

In order to prevent disasters and meet the needs of replanting and replacing seeds, fifteen provinces including Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan have arranged to collect and store more than 578.1 million jin of buckwheat, summer corn, mung beans, millet and other famine-preparedness seeds. Based on the production experience of disaster areas last year, buckwheat has the greatest adaptability and is the main crop for emergency planting and replanting in disaster areas. Therefore, this year's reserves reached 60 million jin, which is more than last year. Twelve provinces, including Hebei, will also store 160 million jin of famine-preparedness seeds on behalf of the three ministries of agriculture, food, and internal affairs under the Central Government.

### 有好籽才有好苗　有好苗才能丰收  各地积极准备春播种子

    有好籽才有好苗　有好苗才能丰收
    各地积极准备春播种子
    本报讯　全国大部分地区为了促使生产大跃进，力争农业大丰收，正在积极进行春播种子的准备工作。据不完全统计：河北、山西、河南、山东、吉林、辽宁、新疆、青海、陕西、江苏、江西、四川等十五省、区已经布置收购各种春播种子一亿二千多万斤。同时，根据1958年的种植规划，普遍要求每个农业社要作好选种和种子保管工作。
    黑龙江、内蒙古、河北、江苏、四川、辽宁等省、区，还以“有备无患”的精神，提出“储种备荒”。黑龙江省规定水稻多留种子30％，小麦10％，玉米30％。四川省委也要求农业社多留10％的后备种子。
    今年因各地将大力进行生产改革和大量推广良种，所以各种良种也普遍进行了调剂。日前统计，由省间调剂的水稻、春麦、高粱、马铃薯等良种，已达三亿斤。其中水稻、薯类、棉花良种调剂数量较大。早稻南特号，已经调剂了一千多万斤，马铃薯调剂了一亿四千多万斤，甘薯十二万斤，调换岱字棉种一亿多斤。动手较早的四川、河北、广东、湖北等省，调拨的种子已由调出地区陆续运往需种地区。尚未进行调剂的省份，也正在筹划品种搭配和拟订需种计划。安徽、湖南、湖北等省根据今年扩大双季稻种植面积的需要，已确定由外省调进早籼、晚粳等稻种一亿五千万斤以上，山东、河南在兴修水利基础上，积极发展水稻，两省拟从河北调进大量种子。目前有关各省正在洽商调拨中。
    为了预防灾荒，不误补种、换种的需要，河北、山东、江苏、安徽、河南等十五省已布置了收储荞麦、夏玉米、绿豆、谷子等备荒种子五亿七千八百一十多万斤。根据去年灾区生产经验，荞麦的适应性最大，是灾区抢种补种的主要作物。因此，今年储备量达六千万斤，比去年为多。河北等十二个省也将根据中央农业、粮食、内务三部的委托，代贮备荒种子一亿六千万斤。
