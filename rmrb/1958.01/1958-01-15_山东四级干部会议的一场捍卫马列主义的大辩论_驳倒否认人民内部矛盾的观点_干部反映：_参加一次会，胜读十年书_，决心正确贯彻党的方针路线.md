Title: A Major Debate Defending Marxism-Leninism at the Shandong Four-Level Cadre Conference: Refuting the View that Denies Contradictions Among the People; Cadres Reflect: “Attending One Meeting is Better Than Reading Books for Ten Years,” Determined to Correctly Implement the Party's Line and Policies

(Reported by this newspaper) The Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a provincial four-level cadre conference from November 13th to December 7th of last year. This conference implemented the spirit of the Eighth Central Committee's Third Plenary Session, adopting the methods of extensive airing of views, full blooming of ideas, and great debate to assist the Provincial Party Committee and provincial-level leading organs in conducting rectification. It also exposed and resolved major ideological issues concerning how to view contradictions among the people, which existed among the cadres present and even among relatively responsible cadres, clarifying matters of principle and unifying thought. This will have a positive and enormous impact on raising the leadership level of Shandong's Party organizations and the ideological and political level of the vast number of Party members and cadres, transforming leadership and work styles, strengthening Party unity, and ensuring the correct implementation of the Party's line and policies.

  **Free Exchange of Ideas, Speaking One's Mind Freely**
  **Over 10,000 Opinions Proposed**

The conference was attended by over 1,500 cadres at or above the level of prefectural committee secretary. At the beginning of the conference, Comrade Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, explained the purpose and requirements of the conference on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee, calling on everyone to eliminate concerns and boldly, thoroughly, and resolutely air their views. He repeatedly mobilized participants throughout the conference, enabling everyone to engage in a free exchange of ideas and speak their minds freely, proposing over 10,000 opinions and posting over 1,000 big-character posters. Most of these opinions were correct. In addition to affirming the achievements of the Provincial Party Committee's leadership and work, they also criticized the shortcomings and problems in the Provincial Party Committee's leadership and work over the past year and more. These criticisms included: in terms of political and ideological leadership, resolving ideological problems was sometimes not deep or timely enough; in terms of agricultural production, there was some relaxation in farmland water conservancy construction from the second half of the year before last to the first half of last year, and the momentum was not strong enough; in terms of industry, there was a lack of long-term and comprehensive planning; political and ideological leadership in science, culture, and education was relatively weak; the resolution of right-leaning thoughts in the political and legal departments was not timely enough; the determination to reorganize work was not strong, and implementation was not effective, and the leadership style was somewhat generalized, etc. In his concluding remarks at the conference, Comrade Shu Tong also first conducted a systematic and profound review of the shortcomings and problems in the Provincial Party Committee's leadership and work on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee and expressed his sincere acceptance of everyone's opinions and his determination to correct them.
Li Feng and Cao Liqin Exaggerate Antagonistic Contradictions
  Attacking the Correct Leadership of the Provincial Party Committee

At the conference, represented by comrades such as Li Feng, First Secretary of the Huimin Prefectural Committee, and Cao Liqin, Acting First Secretary of the Tai'an Prefectural Committee, a concentrated attack was launched on the county-level Party secretary conference convened by the Provincial Party Committee in March of last year, which focused on implementing Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." They even believed that the Provincial Party Committee's emphasis on implementing the Central Committee's policy on correctly handling contradictions among the people was a mistake in estimating the situation at the time, lacked class analysis, lacked class character, and had a blurred class standpoint. For example, Comrade Li Feng said: "At the March conference, the Provincial Party Committee's analysis of the rural situation was incorrect. At that time, it one-sidedly emphasized contradictions among the people and did not emphasize class struggle." "The Provincial Party Committee lacked class analysis of the rural situation." What they considered "class character," "class analysis," and "class struggle" was essentially: the prominent contradictions among the people that had arisen in large quantities after the change in ownership of the means of production, such as well-to-do middle peasants quarreling with other peasants over grain shortages, agitating for withdrawal from the cooperatives, and even having opinions about the work style of cadres, should be seen as "well-to-do middle peasants combining with landlords and rich peasants to oppose socialism," and should be seen as antagonistic contradictions; those who caused trouble should not be dealt with by persuasion and education but should be struck down and suppressed using methods for resolving antagonistic contradictions. Under the guidance of this erroneous thinking, Comrade Li Feng had, as early as before the March conference, approved the establishment of command posts for suppressing current sabotage in three counties (Huimin, Yangxin, and Leling) in Huimin Prefecture and handled more than 100 cases of troublemaking. This erroneous practice was criticized by the Provincial Party Committee at the time, and the relevant central departments also issued a circular of criticism. At this conference, he not only did not admit this mistake but instead believed that the criticism from the Provincial Party Committee and relevant central departments was wrong.

  **The Essence of Li Feng and Others' Mistakes Is "Left" in Form but Right in Reality**

After repeated debates at the conference, everyone cited many examples and statistical materials to prove that it was not the Central Committee's policy of "correctly handling contradictions among the people" or the Provincial Party Committee that firmly implemented this policy that was wrong, but Li Feng himself. The conference believed that the grain shortages and agitation for withdrawal from cooperatives in the rural areas last spring were mainly because leaders and cadres lacked experience in running cooperatives well after collectivization, and there were many shortcomings in their work and style. Many problems did exist within the cooperatives, arousing dissatisfaction among some members. The broad masses of people were not yet accustomed to the new socialist system, and some well-to-do middle peasants wavered on the socialist road. These should obviously be seen as contradictions among the people. Although instances of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries taking the opportunity to carry out sabotage activities could be found in many cases of troublemaking at that time, demonstrating that antagonistic contradictions did exist, they were still a minority, individual, and not prominent. However, Comrade Li Feng believed that the more than 100 cases handled in the Huimin area without error were mostly miscarriages of justice after inspection by relevant departments. The mistake of comrades like Li Feng lay in exaggerating the antagonistic contradictions and using methods for handling antagonistic contradictions to deal with contradictions among the people. This was a "left" mistake in form but essentially a rightist mistake of disbelieving the Party and the majority of the masses.

  **The Policy on Middle Peasants Cannot Be Shaken, We Must Persist in the Policy of Unity, Education, and Transformation**

Because of the mistakes in the above fundamental issues, comrades like Li Feng also had erroneous views on how to treat middle peasants. They believed that the Provincial Party Committee's emphasis on uniting and educating well-to-do middle peasants at the March county secretary conference, without emphasizing struggle, was a manifestation of lacking a class line. They believed that emphasizing unity and education resulted in an increase in troublemaking by well-to-do middle peasants. The conference also specifically analyzed the situation before the March conference. At that time, due to the prominent grain shortages and agitation for withdrawal from cooperatives by well-to-do middle peasants in the rural areas, many places adopted various methods of attacking and ostracizing well-to-do middle peasants inside and outside the cooperatives, and some places proposed to break off relations with middle peasants completely and sever ties with them politically. Therefore, emphasizing unity and education of middle peasants was also necessary and correct. After the March conference, due to the strengthening of education for well-to-do middle peasants in many places and the proper handling of many issues related to their joining and withdrawing from cooperatives, the phenomenon of troublemaking by well-to-do middle peasants decreased. Later, due to the attacks of urban rightists, a portion of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries and bad elements in the rural areas took advantage of our correct handling of contradictions among the people to carry out sabotage activities. Some well-to-do middle peasants also became conceited, and capitalist ideas and activities were more prominent. Under these circumstances, the Party Central Committee promptly proposed carrying out socialist education in the rural areas,打击打击地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子的反社会主义破坏活动，批判富裕中农的资本主义思想，省委也及时执行了中央这一指示。会议认为：李峰等同志的错误，不仅在于用3月会议以后发展起来的新的情况来看3月会议以前的问题，更重要的是对待中农的政策问题。自从开展农村社会主义教育运动以来，对富裕中农的资本主义思想与倾向展开了批判，这是完全必要的，这一批判虽是社会主义与资本主义两条道路的斗争，但仍然是属于人民内部矛盾的问题。可是，有一些同志却因此对党的依靠贫农（包括下中农）团结中农的阶级路线有所动摇，好像对中农特别是对富裕中农不要再团结了，甚至将富裕中农与地主、富农相提并论，将有资本主义言行的富裕中农和有破坏活动的地主、富农一样对待，实际上也是将人民内部矛盾问题错误地看成了敌我矛盾。李峰等同志的观点就代表与反映了这样一种错误的思想和情绪。会议指出：党的团结中农的政策是不能动摇的，对富裕中农仍然是坚持团结、教育、改造的方针，而对富裕中农的资本主义思想是必须批判的，但这一批判，仍然是为了团结教育改造他们。至于个别富裕中农有违法破坏行为，乃至反社会主义行为，则与其他群众犯罪行为一样，应该依法处理。
At this conference, Comrade Li Feng and others also attacked the political and legal departments and cadres for being rightist with the same erroneous views, even completely negating the achievements of political and legal work. The conference unanimously held that the achievements of the province's political and legal work were the main aspect. Some political and legal departments and cadres had right-leaning thoughts, and the Provincial Party Committee had already conducted systematic and strict criticism at the political and legal work conference convened in September and October of last year, and there had been changes after the conference. The reason why Comrade Li Feng attacked in this way was because he was dissatisfied that the Provincial Party Committee and the political and legal departments did not use the method of handling antagonistic contradictions to deal with contradictions among the people as he advocated.

  **Affirm the Good, Criticize the Bad**
  **Rectifying Work Style Is Not Negating Achievements**

Comrade Li Feng and others also had erroneous views on the Provincial Party Committee's emphasis on transforming the style of cadres at the March county secretary conference last year while emphasizing the correct handling of contradictions among the people. They believed that this was because the Provincial Party Committee overestimated the coercive and commanding style of Shandong cadres, that the Provincial Party Committee did not trust grassroots cadres, and even believed that this was a blurring of the Provincial Party Committee's class viewpoint. The conference also cited many vivid and realistic examples to refute their erroneous views. In fact, a large part of the contradictions among the people, especially the troublemaking within rural cooperatives, involved the relationship between township and village cadres and cooperative members. If the work and style of the township and village cadres were good, there would obviously be fewer problems. Therefore, it was entirely necessary and correct for the Provincial Party Committee to emphasize transforming the style of cadres, overcoming coercion and command, correcting violations of law and discipline, and using the method of persuasion and education to handle contradictions among the people. Wherever the spirit and requirements of the Provincial Party Committee were implemented, the number of troublemaking incidents was greatly reduced. The conference pointed out that the Provincial Party Committee's emphasis on transforming the style of cadres did not fundamentally mean denying that the vast majority of grassroots cadres were good or not trusting the cadres, because the fact that the vast majority of grassroots cadres were good did not mean that there were no problems in their ideology and style. According to the spirit of the Central Committee's rectification instructions, further rectifying the style of cadres was still a serious task for Party organizations at all levels in Shandong. According to the views of comrades like Li Feng, it seemed that the style of cadres was already very good, so there was no need to transform their style, let alone conduct rectification. This not only did not conform to the actual situation but also violated the spirit of the Central Committee's rectification. This was neither trusting cadres nor helping cadres but harming cadres. The conference unanimously held that in the future, not only should the transformation of work style continue to be emphasized among ordinary cadres, but responsible cadres like Comrade Li Feng should also be required to seriously transform their work style first.

  **"Promoting" Not "Hindering"**
  **No Arbitrary Reversal of Right and Wrong**

In addition to the above erroneous views, Comrade Li Feng and others also launched a concentrated attack on the First Session of the First Shandong Provincial Party Congress convened in June and July of last year, believing that this congress had a "hindering" effect on agricultural production, completely negated the achievements of the province's work since this congress, and even said that "the Provincial Party Committee's guiding ideology was passive retreat, and right-leaning conservatism occupied a dominant position." The conference believed that this was without any basis. This congress implemented the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's policy of mobilizing all forces to serve socialism, and it was a congress that promoted progress. Since the congress, the achievements in various aspects of Shandong's work have been enormous, not only achieving victories on the economic front but also achieving great victories on the political and ideological fronts, consolidating the socialist system, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and further enhancing Party unity. There have been significant changes and improvements in the ideological style of cadres, and it is wrong to obliterate these achievements.

At the conference, Comrade Wang Yuecun, member of the Provincial Party Committee and Secretary of the Provincial Women's Committee, also spread some words that distrusted the Provincial Party Committee and were detrimental to unity, and expressed many erroneous opinions on the cadre policy. For example, regarding the handling of some major issues, she personally participated in discussions and raised her hand in favor, but she said that she did not know the inside story and spread suspicion. She also said that there were problems in the Provincial Party Committee's use of veteran cadres, and the veteran cadres were demoralized. The conference criticized this erroneous statement, pointing out that it did not conform to the actual situation in Shandong and only reflected Comrade Wang Yuecun's own individualistic emotions.

  **The Ideological Roots of the Errors**

While analyzing and criticizing the above erroneous ideological viewpoints represented by Comrade Li Feng and others, the conference also analyzed the ideological roots of their errors, which were: first, the subjectivist way of thinking was quite serious, with both "left" dogmatism and narrow empiricism. They seized on one or two sentences from the central responsible comrades or books and documents, distorted them, and used them to prove their own correctness and attack the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee. They viewed problems in isolation from the situation at the time and place, and they viewed the situation before the March conference as the summer situation that developed after the March conference. For example, Comrade Fu Ainong, member of the Provincial Party Committee and First Secretary of the Bin County Party Committee, believed that if the leadership understood the situation, it would not be a "summer situation" but a "spring situation." They did not seriously study or learn Party documents and instructions, nor did they conduct specific investigations and analyses of the actual situation, but only viewed and handled problems based on their own narrow experience, so that they lost their way in the face of new problems, could not distinguish between right and wrong, or used old perspectives and old viewpoints to look at new problems, viewing contradictions among the people as antagonistic contradictions, or regarded individual phenomena as the comprehensive and essential problems, using the sabotage activities of individual landlords and rich peasants to negate the objective situation in which contradictions among the people became prominent. Their way of thinking was very one-sided. When talking about achievements, they affirmed everything and could not see shortcomings and errors. When examining shortcomings and errors, they negated everything and obliterated all achievements. When they said right, everything was right, and when they said "left," everything was "left." Second, they were arrogant, complacent, self-important, and lacking in organization. For example, Comrade Li Feng openly proposed his own erroneous policy at the meeting to confront the Provincial Party Committee, as if he were more correct and brilliant than the Provincial Party Committee and even the Central Committee. When he himself made mistakes, he not only did not humbly examine and correct them, but he was also dissatisfied with the criticism from the Provincial Party Committee and relevant central departments and took the opportunity to attack them. This showed that he was arrogant and complacent in his thinking and could only be praised but not criticized or examined. Moreover, this arrogance, complacency, and lack of organization had developed to a serious degree. The essence of this kind of thinking was actually a tendency toward localism and independent kingdoms. It is extremely dangerous for the person in charge of a local Party organization to have this kind of thinking. Third, there was serious individualism. They viewed problems and made suggestions not from the correct standpoint of helping the leadership in rectification and improving work, but to show that they were correct and brilliant, or to vent their dissatisfaction, or to haggle over personal gains and losses, so they could not look at problems calmly and objectively, which made the individual and local interests more opposed to the overall interests of the Party. Fourth, there was liberalism. This was manifested not only in the fact that comrades with seriously erroneous ideological viewpoints at the meeting were not serious enough about political issues and did not consider them carefully, but also in the fact that some comrades adopted a follow-the-crowd or opportunist attitude toward political issues and erroneous ideological viewpoints, so that they sympathized with and echoed erroneous ideological viewpoints at the beginning and once followed behind the errors. In addition, a few people at the meeting adopted an evasive attitude toward major political and ideological issues and did not commit themselves. Although they did not expose their erroneous thinking and were not criticized, it did not mean that the erroneous thinking and its roots were eliminated. The conference unanimously held that both comrades with and without mistakes should deeply draw lessons from this experience.

After the above great debate, Comrade Shu Tong also made a systematic analysis and criticism of the main problems in his concluding remarks. The cadres present unanimously felt that this conference had been very fruitful: "Attending one meeting is better than reading books for ten years." After the conference, all the cadres present unanimously felt that their enthusiasm was high, their thinking was clear, and they expressed a firm determination to do their work well and strive to complete the Party's tasks.

    山东四级干部会议的一场捍卫马列主义的大辩论
    驳倒否认人民内部矛盾的观点
    干部反映：“参加一次会，胜读十年书”，决心正确贯彻党的方针路线
    本报讯　中共山东省委于去年11月13日到12月7日，召开了全省四级干部会议。这一会议，是贯彻党的八届三中全会的精神，采取大鸣大放大争的方法，帮助省委和省级领导机关进行整风。同时也暴露和解决了到会干部乃至比较负责干部中对于如何看待人民内部矛盾等有关方针路线政策的重大思想问题，明确了大是大非，统一了思想。对于提高山东党组织的领导水平与广大党员干部的思想政治水平，转变领导和工作作风，增强党的团结，保证党的方针路线政策的正确贯彻执行，均将发生积极而巨大的作用。
  思想见面畅所欲言
    提出意见一万多条
    这次会议共到有分区委书记以上干部一千五百余人。会议开始，中共山东省委第一书记舒同同志代表省委讲明会议的目的和要求，号召大家消除顾虑，大胆地、彻底地、坚决地鸣放，并在会议过程中一再进行动员，从而使大家做到思想见面畅所欲言，提出意见一万余条，贴出大字报一千余篇。在这些意见中，大部分是正确的，除了肯定省委领导上与工作中的成绩以外，还对一年多以来省委领导上与工作中的缺点和问题，提出批评，如：政治思想领导方面，解决思想问题有的不够深透，或不及时；农业生产方面在前年下半年到去年上半年对农田水利建设有些放松，劲头不大；工业方面缺乏长远的全面的规划；科学文教方面的政治思想领导比较薄弱；对政法部门的右倾思想解决不够及时；对整编工作决心不强贯彻不力，领导作风上有些一般化等等。舒同同志在会议的总结发言中，对于省委领导上与工作中的缺点和问题，也首先代表省委进行了系统深刻的检查，并表示诚恳地接受大家的意见，坚决改正。李峰曹礼琴夸大敌我矛盾
  攻击省委的正确领导
    在会议上，以惠民地委第一书记李峰、泰安地委代理第一书记曹礼琴等同志为代表，集中攻击省委在去年3月召开的以贯彻执行毛泽东同志“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的指示为主要内容的县委书记会议。他们竟认为，省委强调贯彻执行中央关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的方针是对当时的情况估计有错误，是没有阶级分析，是缺乏阶级性，是阶级立场模糊。如李峰同志说：“3月会议，省委对农村形势分析不对头，当时片面强调了人民内部矛盾，没有强调阶级斗争。”“省委对农村情况缺乏阶级分析。”而他们所认为的“阶级性”，“阶级分析”，“阶级斗争”实质上则是：对于生产资料所有制改变以后，大量而突出起来的人民内部矛盾问题，如富裕中农与其他农民闹粮紧、闹退社乃至对干部作风有意见，应该看成是“富裕中农同地主、富农结合起来反社会主义”，应该看成是敌我矛盾；对于闹事者不应该强调用说服教育的方法来处理，而应该采取解决敌我矛盾的方法，加以打击镇压。李峰同志在这种错误的思想指导之下，早在3月会议之前，就曾经在惠民专区的三个县（惠民、阳信、乐陵）批准成立镇压现行破坏指挥部，办了一百多起闹事的案子。这一错误做法，当时曾经受到省委的批判，中央有关部门也曾通报批评。在这次会议上，他不仅不承认这一错误，反而认为当时省委和中央有关部门批评他是错误的。
  李峰等人错误的本质形式上是“左”实际上是右
    会议经过反复辩论，大家列举许多事例与统计材料证明，错误了的不是中央提出的“正确处理人民内部矛盾”的方针以及坚决执行这一方针的省委，而是李峰自己。会议认为去年春季农村闹粮紧、闹退社，主要是因为合作化以后，领导与干部对于如何办好合作社还缺乏经验，工作上和作风上有不少的缺点，社内确实存在许多问题，引起一些社员的不满；广大群众对于新的社会主义制度还不习惯；部分富裕中农对走社会主义道路发生动摇。这些显然应该看成是人民内部的矛盾。当时在许多闹事的案件中虽然也可以找到地主、富农、反革命分子乘机进行破坏活动的事例，并可说明敌我矛盾确实是存在的，但毕竟还是少数的、个别的，并且是不突出的。而李峰同志认为惠民地区办的没有错误的百余起案件，经过有关部门的检查，大部分都是错案。李峰等同志的错误，在于夸大了敌我矛盾，并且用处理敌我矛盾的方法来处理人民内部矛盾。形式上是“左”的错误，实质上则是不相信党也不相信群众大多数的极右的错误。
  对中农的政策不能动摇必须坚持团结教育改造的方针
    李峰等同志由于在上述基本问题上有错误，因而在如何对待中农的问题上，也有错误观点。他们认为：省委在去年3月县书会议上对富裕中农强调团结教育，没有强调斗争，是没有阶级路线的表现，强调团结教育的结果，使富裕中农闹事增加了。会议也具体分析了去年3月会议以前的情况，当时在农村由于富裕中农闹粮紧闹退社比较突出，不少地方对社内外富裕中农采取了种种打击排挤的做法，有的地方提出要和中农一刀两断，在政治上绝交。因此，强调对中农的团结教育也是必要的、正确的。3月会议以后，不少地方由于加强了对富裕中农的教育，并正确地处理他们入社退社的许多问题，富裕中农闹事的现象是有减少的。以后，由于城市右派分子的进攻，农村一部分地主、富农以及反革命分子、坏分子钻我们正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的空子，乘机进行破坏活动；部分富裕中农也有些翘尾巴，资本主义思想与活动有比较突出的表现。在这种情况下，党中央及时提出在农村进行社会主义教育，打击地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子的反社会主义破坏活动，批判富裕中农的资本主义思想，省委也及时执行了中央这一指示。会议认为：李峰等同志的错误，不仅在于用3月会议以后发展起来的新的情况来看3月会议以前的问题，更重要的是对待中农的政策问题。自从开展农村社会主义教育运动以来，对富裕中农的资本主义思想与倾向展开了批判，这是完全必要的，这一批判虽是社会主义与资本主义两条道路的斗争，但仍然是属于人民内部矛盾的问题。可是，有一些同志却因此对党的依靠贫农（包括下中农）团结中农的阶级路线有所动摇，好像对中农特别是对富裕中农不要再团结了，甚至将富裕中农与地主、富农相提并论，将有资本主义言行的富裕中农和有破坏活动的地主、富农一样对待，实际上也是将人民内部矛盾问题错误地看成了敌我矛盾。李峰等同志的观点就代表与反映了这样一种错误的思想和情绪。会议指出：党的团结中农的政策是不能动摇的，对富裕中农仍然是坚持团结、教育、改造的方针，而对富裕中农的资本主义思想是必须批判的，但这一批判，仍然是为了团结教育改造他们。至于个别富裕中农有违法破坏行为，乃至反社会主义行为，则与其他群众犯罪行为一样，应该依法处理。
    在这次会议上，李峰等同志还用同样错误的观点攻击政法部门与政法干部右了，乃至全盘否定了政法工作的成绩。会议一致认为：全省政法工作的成绩是主要的，某些政法部门和政法干部有右倾思想，省委也已经在去年9、10月间召开的政法工作会议上加以系统的严格的批判，会后也有了转变。而李峰同志所以这样攻击，是因为对省委和政法部门没有按照他主张的用处理敌我矛盾的方法来处理人民内部矛盾心怀不满。
    好的要肯定　坏的要批判
    整顿作风并非否定成绩
    李峰等同志，对于省委在去年3月县书会议时，在强调正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的同时，强调转变干部作风，也有错误的看法。他们认为，这是因为省委对山东干部强迫命令作风估计过于严重，是省委对基层干部不信任，甚至认为这是省委阶级观点模糊。会议上也列举了许多生动现实的事例来批驳他们这种错误观点。事实上是：人民内部的矛盾，特别是农村合作社内部闹事，很大一部分是牵涉到乡社干部与社员群众的关系，如果乡社干部的工作好、作风好，问题就显然少得多，因此省委强调转变干部作风，克服强迫命令，纠正违法乱纪，以说服教育的方法来处理人民内部矛盾问题，是完全必要的、正确的。凡是贯彻执行了省委的这一精神与要求的地方，闹事的数量就大大减少了。会议指出：省委强调转变干部作风，根本上不存在否认基层干部绝大部分是好的，或对干部不相信这样的问题，因为基层干部绝大部分是好的，并不等于思想作风上就没有问题。根据中央整风指示的精神，进一步整顿干部作风，仍然是山东各级党组织的严重任务。像李峰等同志的看法，好像干部作风已经很好了，因此也不要转变作风，更不要整风了。这不仅不符合实际情况，也违背中央整风的精神；这不是信任干部，也不是帮助干部，而是伤害干部。会议一致认为：今后不仅在一般干部中仍要继续强调转变作风，而且要求像李峰等同志这样的负责干部首先要认真转变作风。
    是“促进”不是“促退”
    不容随意颠倒是非
    李峰等同志，除了有上述错误观点外，还集中攻击去年6、7月间召开的中共山东省第一届第一次代表大会，认为这次大会对农业生产起了“促退”作用，完全否定这次大会以来全省工作上的成绩，甚至说“省委指导思想上消极退却、右倾保守占了主导地位”。会议认为这是没有丝毫根据的。这次大会贯彻执行了党中央和毛泽东同志的调动一切力量为社会主义服务的方针，是一次促进的会议。大会以来，山东各项工作上的成绩是巨大的，不仅取得经济战线上的胜利，而且取得政治、思想战线上的巨大胜利，巩固了社会主义制度，巩固了人民民主专政，党的团结进一步增强，干部思想作风有显著转变与提高，一概抹煞这些成绩是错误的。
    会议上，还有省委委员、省委妇委书记王月村同志，散布了一些不信任省委，不利于团结的话，并发表了对干部政策方面许多错误的意见。如对一些重大问题的处理，她亲自参与讨论并举手赞成，竟说不知道内情，散布怀疑情绪。还说省委对老干部的使用上有问题，老干部情绪消沉。会议批判了这种错误说法，指出这不符合山东的实际情况，这只反映了王月村本人的个人主义情绪。
  产生错误的思想根源
    会议在分析批判了以李峰等同志为代表的上述错误思想观点的同时，还分析了他们发生错误的思想根源，是在于：第一，主观主义的思想方法相当严重，既有“左”的教条主义，又有狭隘经验主义。他们抓住中央负责同志或书本文件中的一两句话，加以歪曲，用来证明自己的正确，攻击省委领导。他们脱离当时当地的情况看问题，他们把3月会议以前的形势，看成是3月会议以后发展起来的夏季的形势。如省委委员、滨县县委第一书记傅爱农同志就认为：如果领导了解情况的话，那就不是“夏季形势”，而是“春季形势”了。他们对于党的文件与指示不认真研究、学习，对实际情况也不作具体调查分析，只凭自己的狭隘经验看问题，处理问题，以致在新的问题面前迷失方向，不辨是非，或则用老眼光、老观点看新问题，将人民内部矛盾问题看成敌我矛盾问题；或则将个别现象，当作全面的本质的问题，用个别地主、富农的破坏活动来否定人民内部矛盾问题突出起来的客观情况。他们思想方法上有很大片面性，当谈成绩的时候，就肯定一切，看不到缺点、错误，当检查缺点错误的时候，就否定一切，将成绩一概抹煞；说右就一切都右了，说“左”就一切都“左”了。第二，骄傲自满，自高自大，自以为是，目无组织。如李峰同志公然在会上提出自己的错误方针与省委抗衡，好像自己比省委乃至中央还要正确高明；他自己有错误，不仅不虚心检查，改正错误，反而对省委与中央有关部门的批评心怀不满，乘机攻击。这就说明他在思想上骄傲自满，只能表扬不能批评检查。而且这种骄傲自满、目无组织，已经发展到严重的地步。这种思想本质，实际上就是一种地方主义、独立王国的倾向。作为一个地方党组织的负责人，存在这种思想，是极端危险的。第三，严重的个人主义。他们看问题、提意见，不是从帮助领导整风改进工作的正确立场出发，而是为了显示自己正确、高明，或则是发泄自己的不满情绪，或则是从个人得失出发斤斤计较，因此就不能冷静地客观地看问题，以致使个人的局部的利益与党的整体的利益更加对立起来。第四，自由主义。这不仅表现在会议上有严重错误思想观点的同志对于政治问题不够严肃，不作郑重考虑，也表现在有的同志对政治问题和错误思想观点采取人云亦云，或看风驶舵的态度，以至在开始时同情与附和错误思想观点，一度跟在错误后面跑；另外，也有少数人在会上对重大政治思想问题采取回避态度，不置可否，虽然没有暴露自己的错误思想，也没受到批判，但并不等于消除了错误思想及其根源。会议一致认为：不论是有无错误的同志，都应深刻吸取这样的经验教训。
    经过上述大辩论以后，舒同同志在总结发言中也对主要问题作了系统的分析批判。到会干部一致感到这次会议收获很大：“参加一次会议，胜读十年书”。会议结束以后，所有到会干部一致感到情绪高涨、思想明确、表现了做好工作为完成党的任务而奋斗的坚强决心。
