Newspaper Article Abstract:

    Some comrades who have undergone labor production tempering and revolutionary tempering believe that the sending down of cadres has nothing to do with them, and some even say: "After so many years of revolution and so many years as cadres, now we are being told to go down to the countryside to work as commune members, wiping out our glorious history." We believe that this understanding is also incorrect. These comrades do not understand that sending down cadres is for the comprehensive tempering of our cadres. Young intellectuals who have not been tempered should be tempered, and comrades who have undergone revolutionary struggle and production tempering should also be further tempered. Now is the high tide of the socialist revolution. In order to make their thinking adapt to the needs of revolutionary development, everyone should consider how to temper themselves, how to reform themselves, and how to improve their socialist consciousness, acquire more socialist ideas, and thoroughly eliminate capitalist ideas. In our state functionaries, we do not allow the absurd idea that they can only be divorced from production, cannot return to production, can only be "officials," and cannot be "for the people" to run rampant. When society needs it, some of our laborers leave their production labor posts to come to state organs; and when society has another need, when it is necessary to reduce state organs to strengthen the labor front, or when certain people cannot fully play their role in state organs, they can gladly return to their labor posts. This is the normal manifestation of democratic life in a socialist country. Those comrades who are only willing to be cadres and unwilling to be workers or peasants, or who regard cadres as "superior" to the working people, are because they have forgotten that they are members of the working people, servants of the people, and have forgotten that labor is the most glorious thing. The "Directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Participation of Leading Cadres at All Levels in Physical Labor" points out: "In principle, all Communist Party members, regardless of their position or seniority, should place themselves in the same equal position as ordinary laborers." That is to say, although our Party and state organ workers and the working people do different jobs, this is only a necessary social division of labor, and there is no distinction between high and low. Obviously, the idea of ​​considering being a cadre as "superior" to workers and peasants is incompatible with the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and the Party's viewpoint.

    经过革命和劳动锻炼的干部也应该进一步争取劳动锻炼
    有些经过劳动生产锻炼和革命锻炼的同志，认为下放干部与己无关，有的甚至说：“干革命这么多年，当这么多年干部了，又叫下去劳动当社员，光荣的历史一笔勾销了。”我们认为，这种认识也是不对的。这些同志不了解，下放干部是为了全面锻炼我们的干部，未经过锻炼的青年知识分子应该锻炼，经过革命斗争和生产锻炼的同志也应该进一步锻炼。现在是社会主义革命高潮时期，为了使自己的思想适应革命发展的需要，每个人都应该考虑如何锻炼，如何改造，如何提高社会主义觉悟，多掌握一些社会主义思想，彻底去掉资本主义思想。在我们的国家工作人员中，不允许那种只能脱离生产、不能回到生产，只能“为官”、不能“为民”的荒谬思想作怪。当社会需要的时候，我们一部分劳动者离开了生产劳动的岗位来到国家机关；而当社会有另一种需要的时候，当需要缩减国家机关加强劳动战线的时候，或者当某些人在国家机关不能充分发挥作用的时候，他们又能够欣然回到劳动岗位，这才是社会主义国家民主生活的正常表现。只愿意当干部，不愿意当工人、农民，或把干部看作比劳动人民“高一头”的同志，是因为他们忘记了自己是劳动人民中的一分子，是人民的勤务员，忘记了劳动是最光荣的事情。“中共中央关于各级领导人员参加体力劳动的指示”指出：“就原则上说来，一切共产党员，不论职位高低，资格新老，都应当把自己放在同普通劳动者一样的、同等的地位。”这就是说，我们党和国家机关工作人员和劳动人民虽然做着不同的工作，但这只是必要的社会分工罢了，并没有什么高低贵贱之分。很显然，那种把当干部看作比工农劳动人民“高一等”的思想是与马克思列宁主义的观点，同党的观点丝毫不相容的。（摘自1958年1月9日山东大众日报，养成“能上也能下”的优良风气）
