This is the first country in his planned six-week visit to Asian and African nations.

At the airport, President Sukarno told reporters: "Our responsibility is to create a condition of existence in the political, economic, and military fields in order to prevent attempts from any direction to infringe upon our sovereignty and national integrity."

He said: "We do not want to harm any country; on the contrary, we hope to establish the closest relations with all countries in the world."

He said that Indonesia's policy is a positive contribution to peace and stability in Southeast Asia.
