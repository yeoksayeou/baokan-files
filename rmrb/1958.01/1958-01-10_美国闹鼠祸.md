Xinhua News Agency, January 9th dispatch from New York: According to "Newsweek" on January 6th, the United States is currently suffering from a "rat infestation," with large quantities of grain being destroyed by rats. In the northwestern United States, there is currently an average of 10,000 rats per acre of cultivated land. In the Klamath Basin of Oregon, field mice have destroyed $2.5 million worth of grain. American farmers are currently in a state of "despair" about dealing with the rat infestation because the government has not taken measures to eliminate the rats.

    美国闹鼠祸
    据新华社9日讯　纽约消息：据1月6日一期的“新闻周刊”报道，美国目前正在患“鼠祸”，大批粮食被耗子毁坏。在美国西北部，目前平均每英亩耕地有一万只老鼠。在俄勒冈州的克拉马斯盆地，田鼠毁坏了价值二百五十万美元的谷物。美国农民目前对于应付鼠患抱着“绝望”情绪，因为政府没有采取消灭老鼠的措施。
