    Storing Water to Cultivate Ice
    Currently, the northern regions are in the season of snow and ice. While vigorously developing farmland irrigation projects, many areas have also started storing water to cultivate ice. Storing water to cultivate ice involves damming river water in winter to accumulate water and store ice, so that when the ice melts in the spring, it can be used to irrigate farmland, expand the spring irrigation area, and ensure timely sowing of crops.
    The method of storing water to cultivate ice was created by the masses and has proven to be very effective. In Qinghai, Gansu, and the Zhangjiakou area of Hebei Province, this work begins around the time the rivers and streams freeze. Shuangbao Township in Ledu County, Qinghai Province, organizes the masses to cultivate ice using river beaches, forests, and other open spaces. In the winter of 1956, they stored approximately 320,000 cubic meters of water in the 15-li (7.5 km) long gully, ensuring spring irrigation. In Huai'an County, Hebei Province, there are more than 260,000 mu (approx. 42,670 acres) of irrigated land, of which more than 100,000 mu (approx. 16,470 acres) rely on storing water to cultivate ice to make up for insufficient water volume. To ensure timely sowing this spring, the Zhangjiakou area of Hebei Province launched a movement last winter to store water and cultivate ice in rivers, springs, ditches, and ponds. According to statistics from eighty ice cultivation projects, more than 40 million cubic meters of ice can be cultivated, which can expand the spring irrigation area by more than 500,000 mu (approx. 82,350 acres). In Yongchang County, Gansu Province, after building a dam on the East Dahe River to store ice in the winter of 1956, the irrigated area was expanded by more than 5,000 mu (approx. 824 acres) in 1957. In the winter of 1957, twelve more ice dams were built, and the stored ice can irrigate 45,000 mu (approx. 7,413 acres) of land.
    There are many methods for storing water to cultivate ice, and they are not exactly the same in different regions. The methods used in the Zhangjiakou area are: 1. Dispersed mainstream ice cultivation. In early winter, when the weather is relatively warm, the mainstream of the river does not easily freeze. In the wide tributaries and small rivers of the riverbed, the mainstream is blocked so that the river water is dispersed on the riverbed to freeze. 2. Building weirs in sections to dam water. For rivers with smaller water volumes, weirs can be built section by section to store water and cultivate ice. 3.凿冰洞溢水养冰。 After the weather is very cold, ice holes are chiseled on the ice surface of the upper and middle reaches of the river channel, and "stone oxen" made of straw and rubble are inserted into the ice holes to block the bottom water and allow the water to overflow the ice surface, increasing the thickness of the ice layer.
    The masses have a saying that "it is easy to store ice but difficult to use ice." Because during the thawing and melting period, the weather is suddenly cold and suddenly hot, and the ice melts as it is exposed to the sun, and flows away as it melts, it is easy to seep, leak, or evaporate, so it is necessary to seize the opportunity to divert the ice water to the farmland, otherwise all previous efforts will be wasted. So how to use the melting ice water to irrigate the land? It is best to concentrate manpower to break the ice and melt the water to divert and irrigate the fields when the land is just thawing. The masses in various places have also created many good methods for using stored water and cultivated ice to irrigate the land.
    Storing water to cultivate ice does not require complex technology, the materials used can be obtained locally, it does not require much labor, it costs very little money, but the benefits are great. Areas with suitable conditions in the north should seize the season, take active action, make use of every drop of water, not let a drop go to waste, intercept the winter water, and let it serve spring plowing.

    蓄水养冰
    目前北方地区已是雪地冰封的季节了。很多地区在大兴农田水利的同时，蓄水养冰的工作也开展起来。蓄水养冰就是在冬季拦蓄河水，积水储冰，以备春暖冰融的时候灌溉农田，扩大春灌面积，保证农作物适时下种。
    蓄水养冰的办法是群众创造的，效果很好。青海、甘肃以及河北省张家口专区一带，在河水溪流结冻前后，就开始了这项工作。青海省乐都县双堡乡，组织群众利用河滩、树林以及其他空地养冰。1956年冬天他们在十五里长的沟岔里所蓄的冰约三十二万多公方的水，保证了春灌。河北省怀安县共有水浇地二十六万多亩，其中十多万亩是靠蓄水养冰来弥补水量不足。为了保证今春及时播种，河北省张家口专区在去冬开展了河、泉、沟、池的蓄水养冰运动，据八十处养冰工程的统计，可养冰四千多万公方，可扩大春灌面积五十多万亩。甘肃省永昌县1956年冬天，在东大河修坝储冰后，1957年扩大了浇地五千多亩。1957年冬天又做了冰坝十二处，储冰可以浇灌四万五千亩地。
    蓄水养冰的办法很多，各地也不完全一样，张家口专区的办法是：一、分散主流养冰。初冬天气较暖，河水主流不容易结冰，在河床宽阔的支流小河，采取堵截主流，使河水散在河床结冰；二、分段筑堰拦水。水量较小的河，可节节筑堰来蓄水养冰。三、凿冰洞溢水养冰。天大冻后，在上中游河槽的冰面上凿冰洞，把用秸秆和块石包捆成的“石牛”塞入冰洞，堵截底水使水溢出冰面，增厚冰层。
    群众中有所谓“储冰容易用冰难”的说法。因为在解冻消冰时期，天气忽冷忽热，冰随晒随消，随消随淌，很容易渗漏流失或蒸发，所以要抓紧时机把冰水引到农田里，否则前功尽弃。那么如何利用消冰水浇地呢？最好是在土地刚刚解冻时，集中人力打冰化水，引水灌田。利用蓄水养冰浇地，各地群众也创造出不少好办法。
    蓄水养冰不需要复杂的技术，使用的物料可以就地取材，费工不多，花钱很少，效益却很大。北方有条件的地区，应该抓紧季节，积极行动起来，见水就利用，滴水不白流，把冬水拦截住，让它为春耕服务。　（董其林）
