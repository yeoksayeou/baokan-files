Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 4th -- The Indonesian "People's Daily" today published a statement by the General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Ai Di, condemning the slanderous remarks made by the chairman of the Indonesian Socialist Party, Sjahrir. Ai Di said that it seems Sjahrir is obsessed with seizing power, therefore, he is trying to make the Indonesian Communist Party a scapegoat to cover up his past failures and prepare for new adventures.

As previously reported, Sjahrir told a reporter from the Indian English-language newspaper "The Statesman" that "If the Communist Party attempts to seize power while President Sukarno is abroad, it will cause a civil war."

Ai Di said that the Indonesian people clearly know that the Indonesian Communist Party has no desire to seize power outside of parliament, and also know that the Indonesian Communist Party is supporting the current cabinet. He quoted the Indonesian Communist Party's New Year's greetings, saying that the Djuanda cabinet is the headquarters for the struggle to recover West Irian and eliminate Dutch economic interests in Indonesia, and anyone who attempts to overthrow this cabinet is a traitor.

Indonesian public opinion believes that Sjahrir's conversation with the Indian "Statesman" has a special purpose. The Indonesian newspaper "Sin Po" commented today that any conspiracy to overthrow the current cabinet will not come from the Communist Party, but from "other parties." The newspaper also said that the Indonesian armed forces have enough power to crush these conspiracies.

    艾地驳斥一个诽谤性谈话
    重申印度尼西亚共产党无意在国会外夺权
    新华社雅加达4日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天刊载了印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地谴责印度尼西亚社会党主席沙利尔的诽谤性谈话的声明。艾地说，看来沙利尔醉心于夺取权力，因此，他企图使印度尼西亚共产党成为一只替罪羊，来遮掩他过去的失败，并且准备作新的冒险。
    前已报道，沙利尔对印度的英文日报“政治家报”的记者说：“在苏加诺总统在国外期间，如果共产党企图争夺政权，那就会引起内战”。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚人民清楚地知道，印度尼西亚共产党并没有在国会以外争夺权力的欲望，也知道印度尼西亚共产党正在支持着现内阁。他引述印度尼西亚共产党的新年祝词说，朱安达内阁是争取收复西伊里安和肃清荷兰在印度尼西亚的经济利益的斗争的总部，任何企图推翻这个内阁的人都是一个卖国者。
    印度尼西亚的舆论认为沙利尔对印度“政治家报”的谈话有一个特殊的目的。印度尼西亚文“新报”今天评论说，任何推翻现内阁的阴谋都不会出自共产党，而是来自“其他方面”的。这家报纸还说，印度尼西亚武装部队有足够的力量来粉碎这些阴谋。
