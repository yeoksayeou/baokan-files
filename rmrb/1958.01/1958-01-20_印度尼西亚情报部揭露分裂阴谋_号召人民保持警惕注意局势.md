Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 19th: In a statement broadcast on the radio on the evening of the 18th, the Indonesian Intelligence Department called on the Indonesian people to remain calm and to pay very close attention to the situation. The statement pointed out that although President Sukarno had only been abroad for a few days, there was already an uproar in Indonesia, which threatened the foundations of the country and attempted to create division.

The statement said that the Indonesian government respects all kinds of ideologies, but it will eliminate those that disrupt public order and undermine the country's ideology. The statement said that the Indonesian people have enough strength to overcome all existing difficulties and chaos.

It is reported that there have been widespread rumors recently that certain groups are actively preparing to establish a "Sumatra State," attempting to create division in Indonesia.
