　　New Wine in Old Bottles
　　U.S. President Eisenhower added a new term to the U.S. diplomatic vocabulary on January 9: "Overall Peace." Hitler once created a term called "Total War."

　　These are two opposing terms, but in fact, they are in the same vein.

　　In the eight items that Eisenhower listed for "Overall Peace," four are directly related to expanding armaments and preparing for war. These are: adjusting military institutions, intensifying armament work, so-called "mutual assistance," and increasing military expenditures; two items are indirectly for military purposes, namely, so-called "scientific cooperation with various allies" and "education and research work" "in order to serve national security." Another item, "mutual trade," is merely a tool for Washington to implement its "overall" diplomacy. The last item is the so-called "peaceful work." But in this item, apart from empty words about "hoping for peace," there is nothing concrete.

　　The content is the same, and it is also touted as opposing the "threat of communism," but changing the word "war" to "peace" is not out of kindness, but because the times are different.

    新瓶装旧酒
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在1月9日为美国外交词汇增加了一个新词：“总体和平”。希特勒也曾经创造过一个名词，叫做“总体战”。
    这是两个对立的字眼，但其实是一脉相承的。
    在艾森豪威尔为“总体和平”列举的八项内容中，有四项直接关于扩军备战，这些就是：调整军事机构，加紧军备工作，所谓“共同援助”和增加军事开支；有两项是间接为了军事的目的的，就是所谓“同各盟国之间的科学合作”和“以便为国家安全服务”的“教育和研究工作”。另有一项“相互贸易”，不过是华盛顿执行它的“总体”外交的一个工具。最后一项才是所谓“和平的工作”。但是这一项中除了关于“希望和平”的空洞词句，却没有一点具体的东西。
    内容是一样的，而且同是以反对“共产主义威胁”相标榜，但是把“战”字换成了“和平”，并非出于善心，时势不同而已。
