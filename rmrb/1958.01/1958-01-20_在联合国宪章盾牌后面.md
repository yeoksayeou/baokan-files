Behind the Shield of the United Nations Charter
葛正杰
In his reply to Bulganin's letter, Eisenhower once again trotted out the United Nations as a shield to reject Soviet peace initiatives and obstruct negotiations. Due to the great public pressure for negotiations, and a situation that was extremely unfavorable to the United States, Eisenhower's reply was even more pretentious in portraying the United States as a guardian of the UN Charter, and falsely accusing the Soviet Union of being unwilling to be "bound by the obligations assumed under the Charter." But all fabrications and distortions cannot hide the truth of the United States' false peace and true war preparations.
The Soviet Union proposed that a high-level meeting be held by the member states of the North Atlantic Alliance and the member states of the Warsaw Treaty, as well as some countries that have not joined any military blocs, and that the member states of the two treaties conclude a treaty of non-aggression. This proposal helps promote international trust and ease international tensions. In his reply, Eisenhower claimed that the members of the North Atlantic Group "are already bound by the provisions of the United Nations Charter against aggression," and insisted that it was unnecessary to sign a treaty of non-aggression with the members of the Warsaw Treaty. But who doesn't know that the North Atlantic Organization is an aggressive military bloc, which fundamentally violates the purpose of the United Nations Charter to maintain peace. The current Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group, Norstad, and his predecessors have clamored countless times that the group's spearhead is aimed at socialist countries. Although the United States has tried its best to defend the North Atlantic Group, saying that it was organized in accordance with the "inherent right of collective self-defense" stipulated in the United Nations Charter, the aggressive nature of this group was exposed when the Soviet Union requested to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1954 and was rejected. In 1955, the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries concluded the defensive Warsaw Treaty for self-defense. However, the Soviet Union repeatedly proposed the establishment of a European collective security system, and at the same time the abolition of the North Atlantic Alliance and the Warsaw Treaty Organization. And given the United States' firm opposition, it is impossible to abolish the North Atlantic Group for a while, so it advocated that the member states of the two treaties sign a treaty of non-aggression in order to pave the way for further abolition of all military groups. If the United States really wants to see the provisions of the United Nations Charter on maintaining peace and establishing collective security realized, then there is no reason to reject this proposal. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council's decision last December to place ballistic missiles under the control of the Supreme Command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and to establish nuclear warhead reserves, atomic bases and rocket weapon launch sites on the territory of Western European countries, has further increased tensions. Therefore, in order to eliminate factors of mutual distrust between countries, isn't the Soviet Union's repeated proposal on the conclusion of a treaty of non-aggression an effective remedy? Even British Prime Minister Macmillan recently admitted when advocating a policy of strength that although all members of the United Nations are not allowed to commit aggression according to the United Nations Charter, there is nothing objectionable to reaffirming the obligations of the Charter with a treaty of non-aggression. Eisenhower's invoking the United Nations Charter to oppose the signing of a treaty of non-aggression only further proves that the American ruling clique has no intention of peace.
It should also be mentioned that the United States is not only trying to strengthen military groups, but also to link the North Atlantic Group, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Treaty Organization. As the Soviet government pointed out in its note to all members of the United Nations, "Establishing such alliances based on common military preparations, leaving aside the United Nations, would undermine the foundation of the United Nations, a world organization whose purpose is to maintain international peace." Here, isn't it obvious how actively the United States is trying to use military groups to undermine the United Nations?
In his reply, Eisenhower also claimed that according to the United Nations Charter, the obligation to renounce the use of force has already been undertaken for all countries, including those in the Near and Middle East, when he once again rejected the Soviet proposal to guarantee the security and independence of countries in the Near and Middle East. The hypocrisy of this statement also cannot stand the test of facts. Two allies of the United States, Britain and France, openly disregarded the United Nations Charter and launched an aggression against Egypt the year before last, an action that was supported by the United States. Not only that, but after the failure of the British and French aggression against Egypt, the United States put forward the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to fill the power vacuum in the Middle East, and then blatantly plotted a conspiracy to invade Syria, instigating Turkey to threaten Syria with force, which once created an imminent war crisis. At that time, US President's special envoy Henderson brought the plan for armed aggression against Syria to Turkey, and the US Sixth Fleet flexed its muscles, held large-scale exercises, and sent ships into Turkish ports. The US Chief of Naval Operations Burke, who was active in Taiwan, openly clamored that the United States would "support Turkey with all resources" when war broke out in the Middle East, and explicitly stated that it would send a part of the Seventh Fleet to aid Turkey. However, Eisenhower shamelessly declared in his reply that "the United States will never support any aggressive action taken by any collective defense organization or its member states." The recent situation in the Middle East precisely shows how urgently important the Soviet proposal that major powers should not use force in the Near and Middle East is. The fact that the United States is unwilling to undertake this obligation precisely exposes that its aggressive ambitions in the Middle East have not died out.
Now, the whole world is calling for the elimination of the threat of nuclear war. The Soviet proposal for the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom to guarantee not to use nuclear weapons has been warmly supported. But Eisenhower, citing the excuse that the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom "have already guaranteed under the United Nations Charter not to use any weapons to infringe on the territory or political independence of any country," once again refused to accept this proposal. This excuse is untenable for the United States. The United States occupies China's territory of Taiwan and has already transported nuclear weapons there; the United States has established hundreds of military bases around socialist countries; American planes carrying hydrogen bombs are flying day and night over the skies of the countries where these bases are located; now the United States is establishing rocket bases in Western Europe: doesn't this series of nuclear war preparation activities seriously threaten and infringe upon the territory and political independence of other countries?
Eisenhower openly demanded in his reply to "discuss" the so-called "situation in Eastern Europe," which more nakedly exposed its aggressive ambitions. All Eastern European socialist countries except the German Democratic Republic are members of the United Nations, but the United States has never given up advocating the aggressive policy of undermining the independence of these countries. Here, people cannot help but ask, is there even a shadow of the United Nations Charter left in the minds of the American ruling clique?
The American ruling clique not only uses the United Nations Charter to reject Soviet proposals and obstruct negotiations, but also fantasizes about requiring the Soviet Union to give up its veto power in the Security Council to "strengthen the United Nations." It tries its best to prove that as long as it does this, there is no need to hold East-West negotiations, and all disputes will be "peacefully resolved," because it is said that the Soviet Union's use of the veto has "made the Security Council's role in maintaining peace unreliable." Eisenhower's reply is particularly clumsy in this regard.
The principle of unanimous agreement among the five permanent members of the Security Council when voting on substantive issues related to peace is to ensure that major powers take concerted action in the cause of maintaining peace. For many years, the reason why the United States has been demanding the abolition of this veto power, which safeguards the unity of major powers, is precisely because this important principle hinders the United States from creating world divisions and new wars, and prevents the United States from doing whatever it wants by using its majority vote in the United Nations. People remember that in 1950, the Soviet representative temporarily withdrew from the Security Council to protest the United States' deprivation of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. At that time, the United States immediately took advantage of the absence of the Soviet representative to pass the American plan for armed aggression against Korea in the Security Council, and the United States and its vassal states openly waged the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea under the banner of the United Nations, and blatantly occupied China's territory of Taiwan. As everyone knows, the United States has been manipulating the voting machine of the United Nations, and the only thing that hinders its hands and feet is the principle of unanimity among the major powers. This is why the United States is now making the unreasonable demand to abolish the veto power. Its purpose is obviously to tie the hands and feet of the Soviet Union in the United Nations, to force the Soviet Union to give up its just struggle to safeguard peace, and to surrender to the United States' war policy.
The United States has deliberately committed many bad things that endanger peace inside and outside the United Nations, but it still wants to use the United Nations to whitewash itself, and asks others to admit that the United States can continue to do so more unscrupulously. This is a trick that Eisenhower played when he used the United Nations Charter to negate the Soviet peace initiative. However, the Soviet Union, which is loyal to the cause of peace, and the peace-loving people of the world, cannot be intimidated or deceived.

    在联合国宪章盾牌后面
    葛正杰
    艾森豪威尔在答复布尔加宁的信中，再一次搬出联合国来作为拒绝苏联和平倡议、阻挠谈判的挡箭牌。由于要求谈判的舆论压力很大，形势对美国极其不利，艾森豪威尔的复信就更加装模作样地把美国打扮成联合国宪章的护卫者，诬蔑苏联似乎不愿受到“对宪章所承担的义务的约束”。但是，一切捏造和歪曲，都掩盖不了美国假和平、真备战的真相。
    苏联建议由北大西洋联盟成员国和华沙条约成员国以及一些没有参加任何军事集团的国家举行高级会谈，并由两个条约成员国缔结互不侵犯条约。这个建议有助于促进国际信任，缓和国际紧张局势。艾森豪威尔在复信中，却说什么北大西洋集团成员国“都已经受到联合国宪章反对侵略的规定的约束”，一口咬定同华沙条约成员国签订互不侵犯条约是不必要的。但是谁不知道，北大西洋组织是侵略性的军事集团，根本就是违反联合国宪章维护和平的宗旨的。现任北大西洋集团军最高司令诺斯塔德和他的前任不知多少次叫嚷这个集团的矛头指向社会主义国家。虽则美国竭力替北大西洋集团辩护，说什么它是按照联合国宪章规定的“集体自卫的固有权利”组织起来的。可是当苏联在1954年要求参加北大西洋公约组织遭到了拒绝的时候，这个集团的侵略性质就暴露无遗了。1955年，苏联和东欧社会主义国家为了自卫，缔结了防御性的华沙条约。但苏联仍一再建议建立欧洲集体安全体系，同时取消北大西洋联盟和华沙条约组织。并且鉴于美国的坚决反对，一时还不可能取消北大西洋集团，便主张由两个条约成员国签订互不侵犯条约，以便为进一步取消一切军事集团铺平道路。如果美国真的愿意看到联合国宪章中关于维护和平和建立集体安全的规定得以实现，那就没有什么理由拒绝这个建议。去年12月北大西洋公约组织理事会决定把弹道导弹交由北大西洋公约组织最高统帅部支配，在西欧国家领土上建立核弹头储备、原子基地和火箭武器发射场，更加增加了紧张局势。因之，为了消除国际间互不信任的因素，苏联再一次提出关于缔结互不侵犯条约的建议，不正是对症下药的有效措施吗？这一点，甚至连英国首相麦克米伦最近在鼓吹实力政策时也承认，虽然联合国全体会员国根据联合国宪章不得进行侵略，但是用互不侵犯条约来重申宪章的义务是没有什么可反对的。艾森豪威尔搬出联合国宪章来反对签订互不侵犯条约，不过是更加证明了美国统治集团无意和平罢了。
    还应当提到，美国不仅正在力图加强军事集团，而且要把北大西洋集团、东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约组织联结起来。正如苏联政府给联合国全体会员国的照会所指出的，“撇开联合国而建立这种以共同的军事准备为基础的联盟，就会破坏联合国这个以维护国际和平为宗旨的世界组织存在的基础”。在这里，美国是怎样积极地要用军事集团来破坏联合国，难道还不明显吗？
    艾森豪威尔的复信在再度拒绝苏联关于保证中近东国家的安全和独立的建议时，也说什么根据联合国宪章，对所有国家、包括中近东国家在内已经承担了放弃使用武力的义务。这一声言的虚伪性，也是经不起事实的对证的。美国的两个盟国英国和法国在前年就公然无视联合国宪章，对埃及发动了侵略，这种行动曾得到了美国的支持。不仅如此，在英法侵埃失败后，美国提出了填补中东势力真空的“艾森豪威尔主义”，接着明目张胆地策划侵犯叙利亚的阴谋，唆使土耳其对叙利亚进行武力威胁，曾经造成一触即发的战争危机。当时美国总统特使汉德逊把武装侵略叙利亚的计划带到了土耳其，美国第六舰队耀武扬威、举行大规模的演习，并把舰只开进了土耳其的港口。在台湾活动的美国海军作战参谋长伯克公开叫嚷说：美国将在中东爆发战争时“用一切资源支持土耳其”，并明确表示将把第七舰队的一部分派去援助土耳其。可是，艾森豪威尔在复信中竟然大言不惭：“美国决不会支持任何集体防御组织或其成员国所采取的任何侵略行动”，真是无耻之尤了。中东最近的局势，正说明苏联提出的大国不得在中近东使用武力的建议，具有何等迫切的重要性。而美国不肯承担这个义务，恰恰暴露了它对中东地区侵略野心未死而已。
    现在，全世界都在呼吁消除核战争的威胁。苏联提出的苏美英三国保证不使用核武器的建议，受到了热烈的拥护。但艾森豪威尔却借口苏美英三国“已经根据联合国宪章保证不使用任何武器来侵犯任何国家的领土或政治独立”，又一次拒绝接受这个建议。这个借口，对美国来说，是不能成立的。美国霸占着我国领土台湾并已把核武器运到了那里；美国已经在社会主义国家周围建立了几百个军事基地；美国携带氢弹的飞机正在这些基地所在国的上空日夜飞行；现在美国又在西欧建立火箭基地：这一系列准备核战争的活动，难道不是正在严重威胁和侵犯着别国的领土和政治独立吗？
    艾森豪威尔在复信中公然要求“讨论”所谓“东欧局势”，这就更加露骨地暴露了它的侵略野心。东欧社会主义国家中除德意志民主共和国外都是联合国会员国，但美国始终没有放弃鼓吹破坏这些国家的独立的侵略政策。在这里，人们不禁要问，在美国统治集团的脑子里，还留有半点联合国宪章的影子吗？
    美国统治集团不仅拿联合国宪章来拒绝苏联建议，阻挠谈判，而且竟异想天开地要求苏联在安理会放弃使用否决权来“加强联合国”。它竭力企图证明只要这样作，就不需要举行东西方谈判，一切争端都会得到“和平解决”，因为据说由于苏联使用了否决权“使安全理事会的维护和平的作用成为不可靠”。艾森豪威尔的复信在这里表演的手法，是特别拙劣的。
    安全理事会在表决有关和平的实质问题时采取的五个常任理事国一致同意的原则，是为的保证大国在维护和平事业中采取一致行动。多少年来，美国之所以一直要求取消这个维护大国一致的否决权，正是由于这个重大原则，妨碍了美国制造世界分裂和新战争的活动，使美国不能利用它在联合国的多数票而为所欲为。人们记得，1950年，苏联代表由于抗议美国剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位而曾一度暂时退出安理会，那时美国立即利用苏联代表缺席的机会，在安理会通过了武装侵略朝鲜的美国方案，美国及其仆从国家便公开打起联合国的旗帜进行侵朝战争，并且公然霸占了我国的领土台湾。尽人皆知，美国一直在操纵着联合国的表决机器，而唯一妨碍着它的手脚的，就是大国一致的原则。这就是为什么美国现在又提出取消否决权的无理要求，它的目的显然是想在联合国里，绑住苏联的手脚，要苏联放弃维护和平的正义斗争，向美国的战争政策屈服。
    美国在联合国内外蓄意作出了许多危害和平的坏事，却还想拿联合国来粉刷自己，并且要求人家承认美国可以更加肆无忌惮地继续干下去。这就是艾森豪威尔拿联合国宪章否定苏联和平倡议时所玩弄的一种手法。但是，忠于和平事业的苏联以及全世界爱好和平的人民，是吓不倒的，也是骗不了的。
