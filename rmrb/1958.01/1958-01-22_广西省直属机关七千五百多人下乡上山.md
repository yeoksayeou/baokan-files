Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 19th. The work of cadres sent to lower levels from Guangxi Province's directly affiliated organizations has basically concluded. Including the third batch of 678 cadres recently sent down to the countryside and up to the mountains, the total number of cadres sent down is more than 7,500, accounting for slightly less than 47% of the total number of cadres in provincial direct affiliated organizations.

After the first and second batches of cadres sent to lower levels in Guangxi Province arrived in various places, they immediately threw themselves into the current large-scale production campaign centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. In a short period of labor, many cadres have trained themselves to be able to carry loads of seventy or eighty jin, and some have even become activists in production. Eight cadres from provincial direct organizations sent to the Aishan area of Yishan County were rated as water conservancy models by the masses.

These cadres sent to lower levels not only actively participate in labor, but also diligently help their landlords with household chores, quickly integrating with the masses and establishing close class feelings. Many landlords also treat the cadres living in their homes as family members. When a cadre sent to lower levels in Jiuhe Township, Tiandong County, fell ill, the masses brought tea and water, asked about their health, and an old woman even took care of him overnight.

    广西省直属机关七千五百多人下乡上山
    新华社南宁19日电　广西省直属机关下放干部的工作已基本结束。连同最近陆续下乡上山的第三批下放干部六百七十八人在内，总计前后共下放干部七千五百多人，占省直属机关干部总数的47％弱。
    广西省第一、二批下放干部到达各地后，立即投入了当前以兴修水利、积肥为中心的大生产运动。有不少干部在短时间的劳动中，已锻炼的能担七、八十斤的担子，有些还成了生产上的积极分子。下放到宜山县矮山区的八个省直机关干部，被群众评为水利模范。
    这些下放干部不仅积极劳动，而且还勤俭地帮助房东做家务事，很快和群众打成一片，建立了亲密的阶级感情。不少房东也把住到他家里的干部当做家人看待，田东县九河乡一个下放干部生了病，群众送茶送水，问寒问暖，一个老婆婆还看护了他一夜。
