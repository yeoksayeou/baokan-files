Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd - According to TASS, Berlin: German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl delivered a television address on January 22nd, suggesting that referendums be held in East and West Germany on the question of whether the two Germanies should participate in a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

Grotewohl told residents of East and West Germany that West German imperialist ruling circles are striving to turn West Germany into an atomic war arsenal and a base for rocket weapons. The Bonn government is utilizing the decisions of the recent North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council meeting to systematically build up the atomic armament of the West German armed forces. The NATO decisions and the armament measures implemented by the West German government are intensifying the situation in Germany and Europe.

Grotewohl emphasized that people from all walks of life in the two Germanies are demanding an end to the atomic rearmament measures being carried out in West Germany. The government of the German Democratic Republic, which has consistently safeguarded the national interests of the German people, is in favor of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe with the participation of the two Germanies. The government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes the new program of peace and consultation put forward by the Soviet Union.

Grotewohl said that the issue of a nuclear-weapon-free zone is not a trivial or localized issue as Adenauer asserted in his reply to Bulganin, but rather an important issue that is closely related to the German people.

Establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe is the first major step towards eliminating serious dangers. The accession of the two Germanies to a nuclear-weapon-free zone would have a positive impact on resolving the issue of German reunification. All those who desire peaceful reunification of Germany should fully support the plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe.

He pointed out that the realization of this plan currently depends on the decision of the West German government. However, Bonn is deliberately distorting Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki's plan and ignoring the fact that establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe is the beginning of resolving other important issues.

On behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl suggested that referendums be held in the two Germanies on the question of whether the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany should join a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd - Bonn News: The West German government published on the 21st the reply of Federal Chancellor Adenauer to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin. While he expressed satisfaction in the letter with the Soviet Union's efforts to improve relations between the two countries and ease international tensions, and stated that the West German government was willing to "cooperate" and "help reach understanding" in this regard, he actually adhered to the Western position and made every effort to support the attitude of the United States.

Adenauer defended the North Atlantic military bloc in his letter and blamed the Soviet Union for the failure of disarmament talks. He stated that the West German government "completely agrees" with the so-called "suggestions" put forward by Eisenhower in his reply to Bulganin on this issue. These "suggestions" are actually nothing more than a reiteration of the West's stubborn claims that have long obstructed disarmament talks and prevented them from reaching an agreement.

Regarding the issue of convening a summit meeting, Adenauer said that "the necessity of holding an international conference is beyond doubt," but it requires "careful preparation through diplomatic channels." He advocated holding diplomatic negotiations first, and then, depending on the circumstances, holding a foreign ministers' conference to discuss substantive issues, and finally, the heads of government "making clear decisions among various options." According to such a procedure, the West could indefinitely delay the date of holding a summit to truly resolve pressing international issues. Adenauer also advocated stopping the exchange of letters between heads of government, saying that this was not a "suitable method for clarifying fundamental differences of opinion" and "cannot achieve progress."

Adenauer took a negative attitude towards the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, which has aroused widespread interest in Western Europe and West Germany, saying that the proposal involved only a "subordinate issue." He also again rejected the Soviet proposal for East and West Germany to hold negotiations to discuss the restoration of German reunification and the establishment of a German confederation.

This newspaper's comprehensive report, according to Xinhua News Agency: Adenauer's stubborn stance in his reply to Bulganin has aroused anger and dissatisfaction among public opinion in East and West Germany.

Berlin's democratic newspapers on the 22nd criticized West German Chancellor Adenauer's attitude. "Neues Deutschland" emphasized that Adenauer rejected Bulganin's peace proposals but did not put forward any constructive proposals of his own to help ensure peace and ease international tensions. The "National-Zeitung," the organ of the National Democratic Party of Germany, believes that Adenauer rejected all proposals to ease international tensions in his reply. The newspaper emphasized: "Bonn is clinging to the North Atlantic Treaty."

The West German Social Democratic Party's parliamentary group criticized West German Chancellor Adenauer for "repeating old tunes" in his reply to Bulganin. The Social Democratic parliamentary group pointed out: "This reply does not promote the resolution of the disarmament issue or the issue of German reunification in the slightest. All practical and feasible ways to advance disarmament work, such as the Rapacki plan, have been rejected."

The Free Democratic Party's parliamentary group also condemned the Adenauer government for rejecting the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe.

Adenauer's reply to Bulganin became the main topic of discussion in West German newspapers on the 22nd.

"Die Welt" criticized Adenauer for taking a negative attitude towards the proposal put forward by Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

"Neue Rhein Zeitung" expressed dissatisfaction with Adenauer's rejection of the plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, describing it as a "partial agreement."

The "General-Anzeiger," which is close to the Bonn government, admitted: "In fact, Adenauer is following the path indicated by Eisenhower in his reply to Bulganin. Eisenhower's suggestions were even included as a component in Bonn's letter."

    让人民决定德国应否参加无原子武器区
    格罗提渥建议东西德举行公民投票
    德国舆论抨击阿登纳拒绝苏联和平建议
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥22日发表电视广播演说，建议在东西德就两个德国是否应当参加无原子武器区问题举行公民投票。
    格罗提渥向德国东部和西部的居民说，西德帝国主义统治集团正在力求把西德变成原子战争的兵工厂，变成火箭武器的基地。波恩政府正在利用北大西洋集团最近一次理事会会议的决定，有步骤地建立西德国防军的原子军备。北大西洋集团的决定和西德政府所实行的军备措施，使德国和欧洲的局势趋于紧张。
    格罗提渥强调指出，两个德国的各阶层人民都要求结束西德所进行的原子备战措施。一贯维护德国人民民族利益的德意志民主共和国政府赞成在中欧建立有两个德国参加的无原子武装区。德意志民主共和国政府欢迎苏联所提出的关于和平和协商的新纲领。
    格罗提渥说，无原子武装区的问题决不像阿登纳给布尔加宁的复信中所断言的那样是一个微不足道的局部性的问题，而是同德国人民有切身关系的重要问题。
    在中欧建立无原子武装区是走向消除严重危险的道路的第一大步。两个德国加入无原子武器区对解决德国统一问题会产生良好的影响。凡是愿意和平统一德国的人都应该全力支持在欧洲建立无原子武器区的计划。
    他指出，目前，这个计划的实现有赖于西德政府的决定。然而，波恩方面却在故意歪曲波兰外交部长腊帕茨基的计划，无视在欧洲中部建立无原子区是解决其他重要问题的开端这一事实。
    格罗提渥代表德意志民主共和国政府建议在两个德国就德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国是否应当加入无原子武器区问题举行公民投票。
    新华社22日讯　波恩消息：西德政府21日发表了联邦总理阿登纳给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的复信，他在复信里虽然对苏联争取改善两国关系和缓和国际紧张局势的努力表示满意，并且声明西德政府愿意在这方面进行“合作”和“帮助达成谅解”，但是他实际上仍然坚守西方的立场并且竭力支持美国的态度。
    阿登纳在信里替北大西洋军事集团辩护，并且把裁军谈判失败的责任推在苏联身上。他表示，西德政府“完全同意”艾森豪威尔在给布尔加宁的复信中就这个问题提出的所谓“建议”，这些“建议”实际上不过是重申长时期以来西方阻挠裁军谈判使它无法达成协议的顽固主张。
    关于召开最高级会议的问题，阿登纳说，“举行国际会议的必要性是没有疑问的”，但是要“通过外交途径进行仔细的准备”。他主张先举行外交谈判，然后再根据情况举行外长会议讨论实质问题，最后由政府首脑“在各种选择办法中作出明确的决定”。按照这样的程序，西方就可以把举行最高级会议来真正解决迫切的国际问题的日期无限拖延下来。阿登纳还主张停止政府首脑间的信件交换，他说这不是一个“澄清基本意见分歧的适当方法”，而且“不能够取得进展”。
    阿登纳对于西欧和西德国内舆论表现了广泛兴趣的建立中欧无原子武器地区的建议采取否定的态度，他的说法是，这个建议牵涉的只是一个“从属性的问题”。他还再次拒绝苏联提出的关于东西德举行谈判来讨论恢复德国统一和建立德意志邦联问题的建议。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：阿登纳在给布尔加宁复信中采取的顽固立场，激起了东西德公众舆论的愤怒和不满。
    柏林民主报纸22日指责西德总理阿登纳的态度。“新德意志报”强调指出，阿登纳拒绝了布尔加宁的和平建议，但是自己并没有提出任何有助于保障和平和缓和国际紧张局势的建设性建议。德国国家民主党机关报“国民日报”认为：阿登纳在复信中拒绝了一切关于缓和国际紧张局势的建议。这个报纸强调指出：“波恩死抓住北大西洋公约不放。”
    西德社会民主党联邦议院党团指责西德总理阿登纳在给布尔加宁的复信中“旧调重弹”。社会民主党议会党团指出：“这封复信丝毫没有促进裁军问题以及德国统一问题的解决。推进裁军工作的一切切实可行的办法，例如腊帕茨基的计划，都被拒绝了。”
    自由民主党联邦议院党团也谴责阿登纳政府拒绝在欧洲建立无原子武器区的建议。
    阿登纳给布尔加宁的复信22日成了西德各报的主要论题。
    “世界报”指责阿登纳对波兰外交部长腊帕茨基提出的在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议采取否定态度。
    “新莱因报”对于阿登纳把建立中欧无原子武器区的计划说成是“局部协定”而加以拒绝表示不满。
    接近波恩政府的“总汇报”承认：“其实，阿登纳所遵循的是艾森豪威尔给布尔加宁的复信中所指出的路线。艾森豪威尔的建议甚至还被作为一个组成部分列入了波恩的信中”。
